WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:07.139
NARRATOR: Worldwide, 36 billion
cameras are watching us.

00:07.207 --> 00:12.344
On our streets, at work,
and in our homes,

00:12.412 --> 00:15.447
they capture things that
seem impossible.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.617
Science says this
shouldn't happen.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.252
MAN: Do you see that?

00:20.286 --> 00:22.921
NARRATOR: Experts carry out
forensic analysis

00:22.989 --> 00:24.323
of these unusual events.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.191
Wow, what a blast!

00:29.029 --> 00:30.462
[woman screaming]

00:30.530 --> 00:32.664
- This doesn't make sense.
- [screaming]

00:32.699 --> 00:34.700
There has to be
some sort of explanation.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.203
What else is going on here?

00:38.271 --> 00:40.339
NARRATOR: Coming up,
a truck takes

00:40.407 --> 00:42.341
home delivery to the next level.

00:42.409 --> 00:45.344
A 40-ton truck doesn't just
flip over like that.

00:45.412 --> 00:49.214
NARRATOR: Are physical objects
starting to defy gravity?

00:49.282 --> 00:51.050
What? Yes!

00:51.117 --> 00:53.552
NARRATOR: In China,
is a chicken farmer

00:53.620 --> 00:56.021
about to cook up
a Jurassic breakfast?

00:56.089 --> 00:59.591
We do know that chickens are
quite closely related to

00:59.659 --> 01:02.594
the Tyrannosaurus Rexes --
They share a lot of DNA.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.897
[dinosaur roars]

01:04.931 --> 01:07.766
NARRATOR: And a river
of fire chases men,

01:07.834 --> 01:10.602
women, and animals through
a city street.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.539
You see one of these
coming your way,

01:13.606 --> 01:16.175
you better run --
Run for your life.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.144
NARRATOR:
Bizarre phenomena...

01:19.212 --> 01:20.846
Oh, my gosh.
[gasps]

01:20.914 --> 01:23.048
mysteries caught on camera.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.283
[screaming]

01:24.350 --> 01:28.320
NARRATOR: What's the truth
behind this strange evidence?

01:35.728 --> 01:38.764
Now, Lima, Peru.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.904
January 23rd, 2020.

01:45.972 --> 01:49.241
A CCTV camera captures
panic on the streets.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.778
We've got an obvious street
view from what looks

01:52.846 --> 01:55.414
like a security camera,
and people are running past.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.516
Oh, they're running like
they are scared.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.151
HOUSEHOLDER: This kind of looks
like a scene out of

01:59.219 --> 02:00.419
a Hollywood disaster movie.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.521
WALLACE: Got this one kid
that's fell, he pulls

02:02.555 --> 02:04.590
his mother down,
and there's even animals,

02:04.657 --> 02:06.191
dogs running here.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.594
What are they running away from?

02:08.661 --> 02:12.164
They're clearly trying to
escape something bad.

02:16.736 --> 02:19.705
NARRATOR: Suddenly, fire races
through the street.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.474
- Oh!
- The street is burning!

02:22.542 --> 02:25.644
NARRATOR: There is no visible
source of fuel on the road,

02:25.712 --> 02:26.912
and yet it burns.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.214
It's not like a normal flame.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.849
It's like a wave.

02:30.917 --> 02:34.453
It's like a tsunami of flames
just crashing down the street.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.755
NARRATOR:
The source, a mystery.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.258
WALLACE: Here, we see these
flames coming down the street.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.261
But what is off camera
that we do not see

02:42.328 --> 02:44.096
that is terrifying these people?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.664
Everyone is clearly in danger.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.169
NARRATOR: These people
had good reason to run.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.639
30 lives were lost
in this incident,

02:53.706 --> 02:55.674
and author Jeff Belanger
wonders if

02:55.742 --> 02:58.443
the cause could be
the dangerous love affair

02:58.511 --> 03:01.813
Peruvians have with homemade
pyrotechnics.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.115
Through December and January,

03:03.183 --> 03:06.084
the Lima night sky
is just lit up with fireworks.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.553
[fireworks exploding]

03:07.620 --> 03:10.989
NARRATOR: The festive period in
Peru begins with Nochebuena

03:11.057 --> 03:14.593
on Christmas Eve and reaches
a finale in the New Year.

03:14.661 --> 03:18.297
BELANGER: New Year's in Lima
is a spectacular event,

03:18.364 --> 03:20.232
and fireworks are a big part
of it.

03:20.299 --> 03:22.701
[loud fireworks explosions]

03:22.769 --> 03:26.038
NARRATOR: But fireworks are as
deadly as they are beautiful.

03:26.105 --> 03:27.973
[loud fireworks explosions]

03:28.041 --> 03:30.709
In America in 2017,

03:30.777 --> 03:34.680
13,000 people are hospitalized
with injuries caused

03:34.747 --> 03:37.249
by these colorful pyrotechnics.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.185
And in Peru, where safety runs

03:40.253 --> 03:43.155
second to the nation's
fondness for fireworks,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.157
the toll has been even heavier.

03:46.426 --> 03:50.996
In 2001, we had an incident in
Peru where we had a massive

03:51.064 --> 03:53.966
event where all these fireworks
started going off.

03:54.033 --> 03:57.336
[people screaming distantly]

03:57.370 --> 03:59.504
WISE: Firefighters were able
to pick through the wreckage.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.175
They found the bodies
of more than 235

04:03.243 --> 04:05.377
men, women, and children.

04:07.146 --> 04:10.082
NARRATOR: This disaster was one
of the deadliest fires in

04:10.149 --> 04:11.149
Lima's history.

04:11.217 --> 04:15.621
More than 1,000 tons of
fireworks exploded,

04:15.688 --> 04:18.624
causing a firestorm that
burned four blocks to

04:18.691 --> 04:22.060
the ground in the center
of this crowded city.

04:22.161 --> 04:25.097
One survivor recalled rockets
whizzing across the street

04:25.164 --> 04:27.232
and catching fire to a complex,

04:27.300 --> 04:29.268
trapping many people inside.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.604
NARRATOR: Many blamed
the incident on Peru's lax

04:32.672 --> 04:34.940
pyrotechnic laws,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.009
which allowed fireworks to
be sold

04:37.076 --> 04:40.245
on street corners across
the capital.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.914
WALLACE:
As crazy as it may seem,

04:42.982 --> 04:46.985
this whole fiasco started
when we had a firework

04:47.053 --> 04:50.188
owner demonstrating a firework,
and it ignited

04:50.256 --> 04:52.658
the other materials.
- One stray spark,

04:52.725 --> 04:56.862
one careless shopkeeper,
is enough

04:56.929 --> 04:59.398
to cause
a catastrophic explosion.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.066
[siren wailing]

05:01.134 --> 05:02.367
NARRATOR:
Peru now has some of

05:02.435 --> 05:05.937
the strictest fireworks
regulations in Latin America.

05:06.005 --> 05:09.041
But these restrictions have
created a thriving

05:09.108 --> 05:10.142
black market.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.777
There's an enormous problem in

05:11.844 --> 05:14.946
Peru with illegal
fireworks manufacturing.

05:15.014 --> 05:18.617
These unregulated fireworks
are dangerous for the people

05:18.685 --> 05:21.486
who make them
and the people who use them.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.523
In November 2016,

05:24.590 --> 05:28.593
Peruvian authorities seize
21 tons of illegal fireworks

05:28.661 --> 05:31.997
in Lima and then detonate them
outside the city.

05:32.065 --> 05:36.234
[explosion blasts]

05:36.302 --> 05:37.736
So is it possible that it was

05:37.804 --> 05:40.272
an illegal firework that was
behind this?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.274
[crowd commotion]

05:46.412 --> 05:49.581
NARRATOR: Hollywood pyrotechnics
expert Matt Kutcher has over

05:49.649 --> 05:53.151
20 years experience
of blasts like these.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.487
He doubts this tsunami of fire

05:55.554 --> 05:58.156
was a weird type
of firework exploding.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.726
Look at that --
It's like a wave of fire.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.427
So what everybody's running from

06:02.495 --> 06:05.130
has already exploded
or caught fire.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.766
You know what that
reminds me of, right?

06:07.834 --> 06:10.936
When an LPG tank ruptures.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.407
NARRATOR: LPG stands for
liquefied petroleum gas.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.442
It's a low-cost fuel,

06:17.510 --> 06:20.479
usually either propane
or butane, used

06:20.546 --> 06:23.815
for auto fuel in specially
adapted vehicles.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.318
It's heavier than air,

06:26.386 --> 06:29.688
so if it spills,
it flows along the ground.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.891
Could a low-lying flammable
gas be ignited

06:32.925 --> 06:35.093
and create a wave of fire
down the street?

06:35.161 --> 06:37.028
- I think it's possible.
- I think it's possible.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.866
Let's set up an experiment to
see if we can make this happen.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.635
NARRATOR: A concrete floored
vehicle bay plays the part

06:43.703 --> 06:47.672
of the Lima street surface
for this experiment.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.707
All right, gentlemen.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.041
So I think in this space here,

06:50.109 --> 06:53.812
we could try to create
that low-lying fog of LPG,

06:53.880 --> 06:57.716
right? So, if we could bring
in a source of propane

06:57.784 --> 06:59.818
and kind of stuff it into
this cavity,

06:59.886 --> 07:03.221
it allows it to sink
and hit the ground.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.557
The walls will kind of capture
it the way the street did,

07:05.624 --> 07:08.927
the way the curbs did,
and it should roll out here,

07:08.995 --> 07:12.030
and then we'll ignite it
when we can't see it

07:12.098 --> 07:13.165
and see if we can't get that

07:13.232 --> 07:14.499
wave to chase us
right out of here,

07:14.567 --> 07:16.968
the same thing we saw
in that video.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.770
NARRATOR:
An electrical ignition system

07:18.838 --> 07:21.573
will provide a spark
to light the flame,

07:21.641 --> 07:24.543
but parts of the experiment
are hard to control.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.645
The gas itself is invisible.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.480
Hopefully, because
we actually can't see

07:28.548 --> 07:29.681
how much propane
we're putting in there,

07:29.749 --> 07:32.918
it's not too much --
Let's release

07:32.985 --> 07:35.020
the propane and make some waves.

07:35.087 --> 07:37.489
NARRATOR: The gas, when released
from the pressurized

07:37.557 --> 07:41.726
container, mixes with air
to become highly volatile.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.163
- A little hot.
- It's hot.

07:46.632 --> 07:51.136
Hey, we got to go --
In 3, 2, 1, hit it!

07:54.373 --> 07:56.675
NARRATOR: Coming up,
can Kutcher catch

07:56.742 --> 07:59.478
a wave of fire?
- Three, two, one, trigger.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.881
Wham! It goes off.

08:02.949 --> 08:07.752
NARRATOR: And the egg that will
eat you for breakfast.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.089
HYDE: This demonic hybrid
turned out to be incredibly

08:11.156 --> 08:14.426
aggressive and killed
the other eight in the brood.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.835
NARRATOR:
Cameras capture men,

08:23.903 --> 08:27.672
women, and animals fleeing from
a wave of fire that appears to

08:27.740 --> 08:29.708
chase them down the street.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.981
Pyrotechnics expert Matt
Kutcher wants to know if

08:36.048 --> 08:39.084
a spill of liquefied petroleum
gas could create

08:39.151 --> 08:40.952
this fire tsunami.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.122
Let's release the propane
and make some waves.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.127
3, 2, 1 -- hit it.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.098
Wow! It goes off.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.499
I think we made a wave of fire.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.836
NARRATOR:
Slowed down frame by frame,

08:57.904 --> 09:00.005
the wave of fire can clearly

09:00.007 --> 09:02.440
be seen racing away
from the explosion.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.943
A wave of fire just coming
right towards us,

09:05.011 --> 09:06.745
right on the ground.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.980
NARRATOR: The resemblance
to the fire burning

09:09.048 --> 09:11.216
on the Lima street is striking.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.018
KUTCHER: You know,
with just one spark,

09:13.085 --> 09:16.187
you get a terrifying wave of
fire from that LPG.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.157
It's just stuck on the ground,
and wham! It goes off.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.162
NARRATOR: This experiment
demonstrates the lethal

09:24.230 --> 09:27.465
potential of a fuel that
many of us have in our homes.

09:28.668 --> 09:32.470
Each year, gas leaks cause
an average of 4,200 fires

09:32.538 --> 09:36.007
in U.S. homes,
killing about 40 Americans.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.909
[loud explosion]

09:37.977 --> 09:40.312
If you see one of these waves
of fire coming your way,

09:40.379 --> 09:43.315
you better run -- for your life.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.817
NARRATOR: Police reports
show a traffic accident

09:45.885 --> 09:48.820
just moments before the blaze
moved down the street.

09:48.888 --> 09:53.158
A fuel tanker carrying almost
3,000 gallons of liquefied gas

09:53.225 --> 09:56.428
came speeding down a freeway
off ramp and hit a pothole.

09:57.663 --> 10:01.633
The impact severed a fuel
line, causing a massive leak.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.102
NARRATOR: The people captured
on camera got away,

10:04.170 --> 10:07.405
but others had no warning
the flames were coming.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.207
WALLACE: There was
30 people that were killed

10:09.275 --> 10:11.610
in this tragedy,
and the majority of them were

10:11.677 --> 10:13.645
due to the severe burns
they sustained.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.547
This disaster was the result of

10:15.615 --> 10:18.883
poor safety practices
and crumbling infrastructure.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.220
And for the people who were
caught in the middle, bad luck.

10:26.258 --> 10:29.561
Now, Shenyang City, China.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.669
October 8th, 2017.

10:37.737 --> 10:41.973
On a Chinese chicken farm,
an unusual egg.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.179
- Oh!
- What is even happening here?

10:49.215 --> 10:53.752
This egg is unlike any
chicken egg I've ever seen.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.654
NARRATOR:
The shell dips at the top,

10:55.721 --> 10:58.957
allowing some weird protrusion
to poke out.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.593
GROWICK: This egg has
a strange end to it,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.662
something that almost looks
like a tail.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.463
It's actually quite menacing.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.066
GROWICK: What could have caused
a chicken to lay an egg

11:08.134 --> 11:09.467
this shape?

11:09.535 --> 11:11.736
There must be something
strange going on here.

11:15.307 --> 11:18.677
NARRATOR: Biologist Carin Bondar
recognizes a familiar texture

11:18.778 --> 11:20.311
to this weird appendage.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.215
The protrusion
appears to be scaly,

11:24.283 --> 11:26.584
almost reptilian in a way.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.286
Chickens we know are

11:28.354 --> 11:31.523
actually very closely related
to reptiles.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.324
NARRATOR: Chickens,
like all modern birds,

11:33.392 --> 11:36.928
are part of a reptile subclass
known as archosaurs

11:36.996 --> 11:40.031
that dates back nearly
250 million years.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.332
[rooster crowing]

11:41.400 --> 11:43.001
Chickens are actually relatively

11:43.069 --> 11:45.904
closely related to alligators
and crocodiles.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.907
And in fact, alligators and
crocodiles are more closely

11:48.974 --> 11:52.844
related to birds than they are
to many other reptiles.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.779
NARRATOR: Potvin believes
that some sort of

11:54.847 --> 11:57.782
biological throwback could have
caused a reptilian

11:57.850 --> 12:00.018
appendage to emerge
from the egg.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.454
We get something called atavism,

12:02.521 --> 12:06.124
which is where genes will
actually almost regress to

12:06.192 --> 12:07.926
a former state.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.462
So could this be what
we're seeing here?

12:10.529 --> 12:13.064
GROWICK: Recently, scientists
have been experimenting

12:13.132 --> 12:17.168
with chicken DNA in an attempt
to re-express old genes.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.703
This has actually
allowed them to grow

12:18.771 --> 12:22.073
specific chickens that have
teeth in their beaks.

12:22.141 --> 12:27.378
NARRATOR: In 2006, a biologist
in Wisconsin created a chicken

12:27.446 --> 12:30.582
embryo with an alligator's
snout and teeth,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.318
and gators aren't the chicken's

12:33.385 --> 12:36.387
only unexpected
razor-toothed relative.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.326
And we do know that chickens
are quite closely related to

12:41.393 --> 12:44.429
the Tyrannosaurus Rexes --
They share a lot of DNA.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.766
NARRATOR:
The biggest modern rooster,

12:47.833 --> 12:52.137
the Jersey Giant, is just over
two feet tall and weighs in at

12:52.204 --> 12:55.607
15 pounds, while T-rex
may have grown

12:55.674 --> 12:59.811
to 40 feet long
and weighed up to 10 tons,

12:59.879 --> 13:03.248
but biologists recognize
the similarity between

13:03.315 --> 13:05.617
the two creatures' basic
body shapes.

13:05.684 --> 13:09.120
[dinosaur roaring]

13:09.188 --> 13:12.423
NARRATOR: And in 2003,
tiny traces of collagen

13:12.491 --> 13:16.027
were discovered inside
a fossilized T-rex femur.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.031
Collagen is a protein that forms

13:20.065 --> 13:24.335
the connective tissues in skin,
cartilage, and bone marrow.

13:24.403 --> 13:28.807
When scientists examined
the Tyrannosaurus collagen,

13:28.874 --> 13:32.076
it was similar to collagen
found in modern chickens

13:32.144 --> 13:33.144
and ostriches.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.181
When you look at a chicken,

13:36.248 --> 13:38.416
you're technically looking at
an incredibly

13:38.484 --> 13:39.951
highly evolved dinosaur.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.988
[dinosaur growling]

13:44.056 --> 13:47.692
Paleontologist Jack Horner
believes that by unlocking

13:47.760 --> 13:49.928
atavistic traits in bird genes,

13:49.962 --> 13:52.664
it might be possible to
reverse engineer

13:52.731 --> 13:54.332
prehistoric monsters.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.835
[dinosaur roaring]

13:56.902 --> 13:59.237
Chicken embryos
with snouts instead of beaks

13:59.305 --> 14:01.806
and some raptor-like legs.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.042
NARRATOR: This egg could be
evidence of prehistoric

14:04.109 --> 14:07.312
genes becoming reactivated
in modern chickens.

14:10.149 --> 14:14.219
And Karen Bellinger discovers
fast-growing Shenyang City

14:14.253 --> 14:16.421
could offer
the perfect conditions

14:16.488 --> 14:19.324
to cause such
biological throwbacks to occur

14:19.391 --> 14:21.226
outside of a lab.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.162
Shenyang City,
where this egg is from,

14:24.230 --> 14:27.632
is incredibly polluted, to
the point that walking around

14:27.666 --> 14:29.467
breathing the air all day is

14:29.535 --> 14:32.070
like smoking three packs
of cigarettes.

14:32.137 --> 14:35.006
NARRATOR: Shenyang has recorded
air pollution levels

14:35.074 --> 14:36.341
50 times higher

14:36.408 --> 14:40.178
than those considered safe by
the World Health Organization.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.946
The city's air quality has been

14:42.014 --> 14:44.616
linked to mutations in
developing fetuses.

14:44.683 --> 14:48.753
Could it be that we're now
seeing a regression of

14:48.821 --> 14:51.956
the chicken's genes
to something that's more

14:52.024 --> 14:53.992
similar to what a T-rex
might have looked like?

14:55.694 --> 14:58.563
NARRATOR: If this is the case,
we may have to prepare

14:58.631 --> 15:03.001
for a future in which
chicken-saurs walk the Earth.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.971
Suddenly, taking your kids to
an innocent petting zoo could

15:07.039 --> 15:10.008
end up being more like taking
them to Jurassic Park.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.143
NARRATOR: But biologist
Carin Bondar

15:12.244 --> 15:14.612
thinks it's unlikely
that pollution alone

15:14.680 --> 15:17.482
could trigger
enough atavistic mutations to

15:17.549 --> 15:21.719
cause a chicken to revert into
a full-blown dinosaur.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.156
BONDAR: I'm not convinced
that something like

15:25.224 --> 15:27.492
that is actually possible
in nature.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.328
So there must be something
else going on.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.833
NARRATOR: Coming up,
did a mash-up of

15:35.901 --> 15:37.802
modern creatures make a monster?

15:39.238 --> 15:41.472
Could the father of
this chicken egg

15:41.540 --> 15:44.075
actually be some kind of snake?

15:44.143 --> 15:46.878
NARRATOR: And the incredible
floating truck.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.481
WOLSHON: One minute, you're
sitting, having a coffee

15:50.549 --> 15:52.250
and the next minute,
you're looking at a truck

15:52.318 --> 15:53.785
that is now sitting
on your roof.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.126
NARRATOR:
A farmer in China films

16:02.194 --> 16:05.163
a scaly limb emerging from
a chicken egg.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.867
Biologist Leslie Samuel
believes the protrusion looks

16:09.935 --> 16:12.170
reptilian, and he suspects

16:12.237 --> 16:14.205
that something
disturbing has occurred to

16:14.273 --> 16:17.575
produce this extraordinary egg.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.978
Could the father of
this chicken egg

16:20.045 --> 16:21.946
actually be some kind of snake?

16:24.116 --> 16:25.283
NARRATOR:
In the Middle Ages,

16:25.351 --> 16:26.985
it was commonly believed that

16:27.052 --> 16:30.855
snakes and chickens could
produce offspring.

16:30.923 --> 16:35.526
These eggs were laid by hens
but hatched as serpents.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.863
NARRATOR: It sounds like
a medieval legend,

16:38.931 --> 16:41.766
but on September 17th, 1881,

16:41.834 --> 16:45.870
the National Tribune
newspaper runs a story about

16:45.938 --> 16:50.274
an incredible incident in
Marlton, New Jersey.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.411
A young boy found
a juvenile snake

16:53.479 --> 16:57.081
and paired it up with
his newly hatched chicken.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.418
He raised them together
in the same cage,

17:00.486 --> 17:03.187
and so the two animals
became friends.

17:03.255 --> 17:07.191
NARRATOR: Then events take
an even stranger turn.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.160
It looks like a chicken
and a snake

17:09.228 --> 17:13.231
had some kind of weird
Romeo and Juliet romance.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.733
BONDAR: Then the chicken
laid some eggs,

17:15.801 --> 17:19.037
but one of them was different
than all of the others.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.673
NARRATOR: When the eggs hatch,
one of the newborns appears

17:22.741 --> 17:26.077
to be something straight out
of a medieval horror story.

17:26.144 --> 17:30.148
One of them actually ended up
hatching into some kind of

17:30.215 --> 17:33.117
disgusting hybrid creature
with a chicken's body

17:33.185 --> 17:36.454
and a snake's head,
complete with a forked tongue

17:36.522 --> 17:38.856
that would come out
and sample the air.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.025
NARRATOR: It's reported that
the creature's hideous

17:41.093 --> 17:44.929
appearance is matched only
by its hostility.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.832
This demonic hybrid
turned out to be incredibly

17:47.899 --> 17:51.202
aggressive and killed
the other eight in the brood.

17:51.270 --> 17:55.139
NARRATOR: People from across
the county come to

17:55.174 --> 17:57.608
see this freak of nature
for themselves.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.979
BONDAR: There were several
newspaper stories written about

18:02.047 --> 18:03.681
the incident --
It became somewhat

18:03.749 --> 18:06.284
of a neighborhood sensation.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.519
If these accounts are to
be believed,

18:08.587 --> 18:10.988
who knows what's gonna
hatch out of this egg.

18:11.056 --> 18:16.160
NARRATOR: There are over
200 species of snake in China,

18:16.195 --> 18:18.796
including the deadly
Chinese cobra.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.967
A Taiwanese study
found its bite kills over

18:23.035 --> 18:26.370
15 percent of humans who get
infected with its venom.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.808
A chake or a snicken
on the loose

18:30.876 --> 18:34.145
could be very bad news for
citizens of Shenyang.

18:35.514 --> 18:39.150
This farm potentially just
became a much scarier place.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.086
NARRATOR:
After the video was released,

18:42.154 --> 18:44.355
the egg mysteriously disappears.

18:45.424 --> 18:48.426
Scientists think
it's unlikely that a snake

18:48.493 --> 18:52.096
and a chicken could produce
live offspring,

18:52.164 --> 18:54.765
but until another explanation
comes along,

18:54.833 --> 18:57.969
locals fear of venomous rooster
could be

18:58.036 --> 19:00.905
a cock-a-doodle danger
to the people of Shenyang.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.978
I'll never look at a chicken
the same way again.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.385
Now, Alban in Ontario, Canada.

19:17.890 --> 19:22.160
September 9th, 2019.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.562
Dennis Lefebvre dash cam records

19:24.630 --> 19:26.297
a truck traveling ahead of him.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.768
This video starts out
just driving along

19:30.836 --> 19:33.437
a nice, open road around 5 PM.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.373
Nothing looks out of
the ordinary.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.141
Then something really
strange happens.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.343
NARRATOR:
The truck veers off the road.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.945
[tires screeching]

19:41.013 --> 19:42.446
[crashing noises]

19:42.514 --> 19:45.016
Its back end launches
into the air,

19:45.083 --> 19:48.052
coming down on the roof of
a two story house.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.388
Ooh... what?

19:51.423 --> 19:54.058
- I can't believe this!
- What just happened there?

19:54.092 --> 19:55.760
NARRATOR:
Lefebvre stops to check if

19:55.827 --> 19:58.763
the truck driver and the house's
occupants are okay.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.501
WOLSHON: One minute, you're
sitting, having a coffee,

20:03.569 --> 20:04.735
and the next minute,
you're looking at

20:04.803 --> 20:06.904
a truck that is now sitting
on your roof.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.173
NARRATOR: The driver emerges
from his cab,

20:09.241 --> 20:11.475
dazed but seemingly unhurt.

20:11.543 --> 20:15.379
The homeowners are uninjured
but find themselves confronted

20:15.447 --> 20:16.414
with a mystery --

20:16.481 --> 20:19.183
How did a truck get on top of
their house?

20:19.251 --> 20:22.253
40-ton truck doesn't just
flip over like that.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.122
The energy required to achieve
this is immense.

20:25.190 --> 20:29.227
It's almost as if a giant,
invisible hand has lifted

20:29.294 --> 20:33.631
that truck out and placed it
gently on that house.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.334
I'd expect to see something
like that in a video game,

20:36.401 --> 20:38.502
but not in real life.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.539
NARRATOR: There were
no high winds

20:41.607 --> 20:43.007
on the day of the incident,

20:43.075 --> 20:46.444
but an eyewitness report says
that as the truck starts to

20:46.511 --> 20:49.280
levitate, a loud noise
can be heard.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.350
Physicist Saad Sarwana

20:52.417 --> 20:55.553
investigates if it
could be connected.

20:55.621 --> 20:59.457
Could that loud bang be
responsible for levitating

20:59.524 --> 21:00.858
this truck off the ground?

21:03.295 --> 21:05.496
Sound has a powerful presence.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.499
Loud music can rattle windows.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.469
An opera singer
can shatter glass.

21:11.536 --> 21:15.106
Ultrasound waves can pulverize
kidney stones.

21:15.173 --> 21:18.376
If you can create sound waves
which are more powerful than

21:18.443 --> 21:21.012
the gravity pushing
an object down,

21:21.079 --> 21:23.414
you can create
acoustic levitation.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.817
NARRATOR: Acoustic Levitation
is achieved when

21:26.885 --> 21:31.222
an intense sound, normally
greater than 150 DB,

21:31.290 --> 21:34.692
the same intensity as a jet
engine at takeoff, is

21:34.760 --> 21:36.994
aligned into
a reflective frequency

21:37.062 --> 21:39.130
called a standing wave that can

21:39.197 --> 21:41.032
suspend an object in the air.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.936
Could a phenomena like
acoustic levitation

21:46.004 --> 21:47.805
lift this truck in the air?

21:51.810 --> 21:54.245
NARRATOR: Coming up,
can the power of sound

21:54.313 --> 21:56.747
toss a truck like a toy?

21:56.815 --> 21:59.083
The humble truck could
very easily

21:59.151 --> 22:01.152
be turned into a super killer.

22:01.219 --> 22:04.522
NARRATOR: And after the tragic
death of a young girl...

22:10.262 --> 22:12.963
a heavenly miracle follows
a hellish blaze.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.932
You see everything burned,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.835
and this one shrine that
is untouched.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.112
NARRATOR: A driver in Canada
records a truck lifting

22:28.180 --> 22:30.548
into the air
and landing on a house.

22:31.817 --> 22:34.251
The eyewitness reports
hearing a mysterious

22:34.319 --> 22:37.621
loud noise as the truck
jolts upwards.

22:37.689 --> 22:42.126
Could the power of sound alone
have levitated the truck?

22:44.363 --> 22:45.696
All right.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.932
NARRATOR:
Engineer Nick Householder wants

22:47.966 --> 22:50.167
to put the theory to the test.

22:50.235 --> 22:53.471
So what I have here is

22:53.538 --> 22:56.807
a set of ultrasonic speakers.

22:58.577 --> 23:01.078
Each one of them is designed
to put out a sound wave

23:01.146 --> 23:04.248
so high-pitched
that we can't hear it.

23:04.316 --> 23:07.017
If I'm able to produce

23:07.085 --> 23:10.988
a standing sound waves between
these two speakers,

23:11.056 --> 23:14.358
there is effectively
a frozen sound wave.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.261
The pockets of high and low
pressure should be able

23:17.329 --> 23:22.032
to support an object like
a surfer on the ocean.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.601
I'm using the oscilloscope to

23:23.668 --> 23:25.636
make sure that
the two waves line up.

23:26.805 --> 23:30.408
So now, the yellow wave is
as strong as I can get it,

23:30.475 --> 23:33.477
and its peak lines up at
the center of the square wave.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.515
What I have here is a small
piece of Mylar --

23:37.582 --> 23:41.285
It's thin, it's lightweight,
and it also reflects

23:41.353 --> 23:42.453
sound waves.

23:42.521 --> 23:45.556
So it should be able to slot
into the low pressure

23:45.624 --> 23:47.658
zones that this standing wave
has created

23:47.726 --> 23:50.027
between the two speakers --
Let's see.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.100
What?
Yes!

24:01.540 --> 24:03.674
That's acoustic levitation.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.343
This proves
that it's possible to

24:06.411 --> 24:09.180
levitate an object with
sound waves.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.615
NARRATOR:
But there's a problem.

24:11.683 --> 24:15.686
The Mylar weighs just
a fraction of an ounce.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.889
The truck in the footage
weighs about 40 tons.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.992
For something
the size of a truck,

24:22.060 --> 24:24.929
you would need a huge
sound source,

24:24.996 --> 24:27.565
as well as an immense
amount of power.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.099
We're talking about speakers
the size of

24:29.167 --> 24:32.436
a football stadium and
the energy of a small town.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.972
I don't see anything
like that on the road.

24:37.609 --> 24:40.077
NARRATOR:
When engineer Rachel de Barros

24:40.144 --> 24:41.278
studies the footage,

24:41.346 --> 24:44.515
She notices the truck swerving
off the road just before

24:44.583 --> 24:46.150
the moment of impact.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.287
Perhaps that could be
the start of a death

24:50.355 --> 24:51.789
wobble incident.

24:51.857 --> 24:55.926
Jeeps and trucks have a solid
axle, and that makes them prone

24:55.961 --> 24:58.062
to vibration and shaking along

24:58.129 --> 25:01.866
the suspension and steering,
and it can get so bad, it can

25:01.933 --> 25:04.134
lead to what's called
death wobble.

25:04.202 --> 25:05.903
MORGAN: The way that it happens
is if you're driving

25:05.971 --> 25:08.005
down the road,
and you hit a bump,

25:08.073 --> 25:09.507
it doesn't
even have to be a big one,

25:09.574 --> 25:13.511
the bump will resonate through
the front axle, and it will feed

25:13.578 --> 25:15.513
into itself
and make itself worse.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.781
NARRATOR:
A death wobble can occur

25:17.849 --> 25:20.551
at just 50 miles per hour.
- DE BARROS: Before you know it,

25:20.619 --> 25:23.754
your steering wheel is
whipping back and forth,

25:23.822 --> 25:26.457
which leaves you
white knuckling it.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.192
NARRATOR:
When the death wobble strikes,

25:28.260 --> 25:31.662
it can kickstart a terrifying
chain of events.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.397
If that's what's happening here,

25:33.465 --> 25:36.000
the swerving wheel has set
the truck on a course

25:36.067 --> 25:37.134
for disaster.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.803
You can see the front of
the truck going right into

25:39.871 --> 25:43.941
the ditch, and this may have
acted somewhat like a ramp.

25:44.009 --> 25:46.410
NARRATOR: The truck slams
into a utility pole,

25:46.478 --> 25:49.513
snapping the pole in half
and bringing the truck

25:49.548 --> 25:50.814
to a dead stop.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.517
The truck has all
this forward moving inertia,

25:53.585 --> 25:55.920
and that inertia has got to
go somewhere.

25:55.987 --> 25:58.689
NARRATOR: The redirected energy
lifts the back of the truck off

25:58.757 --> 26:02.159
the road, but De Barros doesn't
believe that this inertia would

26:02.226 --> 26:04.828
be enough to lift
it 15 feet in the air.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.899
This on its own is very unlikely

26:08.967 --> 26:11.502
to cause the entire
back to flip up.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.304
NARRATOR: The final piece
of the puzzle is

26:13.371 --> 26:16.907
a second jolt visible just
after the moment of impact.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.342
BRENSENBERGER: If there's
something inside of

26:18.376 --> 26:20.644
the back part of the truck,
it may have shifted from

26:20.712 --> 26:22.479
the sudden stop,
and that could have pushed

26:22.514 --> 26:24.348
the truck in an upward motion.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.883
NARRATOR:
At the moment of impact,

26:25.951 --> 26:30.287
an unsecured cargo sliding
down to the front could push

26:30.355 --> 26:34.191
the truck up into the air like
it was flipped by a superhero.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.729
This load shift can be deadly --
When whatever's inside

26:38.796 --> 26:40.831
the trailer can
move independently,

26:40.865 --> 26:44.034
it can slide around, and when
the brakes are applied,

26:44.102 --> 26:47.905
can shift forward even into
the cab, killing the driver.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.407
BRENSENBERGER: An unsecured load
can throw off the truck's

26:50.475 --> 26:51.809
center of gravity,

26:51.876 --> 26:55.112
and this can result in
a rollover or jack knifing.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.948
NARRATOR: The footage that looks
like an astonishing act

26:58.016 --> 27:00.150
of levitation is actually
a glimpse of

27:00.218 --> 27:02.820
a hidden killer
riding the highways.

27:02.887 --> 27:06.490
It is estimated that 800,000
trucks carrying dangerous

27:06.558 --> 27:07.791
cargoes are hauled across

27:07.859 --> 27:09.960
American roads every single day.

27:10.028 --> 27:14.264
Some of them carrying explosive
fuels and toxic chemicals.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.401
Which means that
the humble truck could very

27:17.469 --> 27:19.670
easily be turned
into a super killer.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.806
NARRATOR: This time,
everyone walked away.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.208
I think what
we've learned is that

27:24.275 --> 27:26.910
danger can strike in
the most unexpected places.

27:30.849 --> 27:35.019
Now, Armstrong in Santa Fe,
Argentina.

27:38.923 --> 27:41.425
August 3rd, 2020.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.928
A firefighter
films the aftermath of

27:44.996 --> 27:48.699
a wildfire that swept through
an area of farmland.

27:49.868 --> 27:53.237
He's walking through
this black, decimated,

27:53.304 --> 27:55.239
ravaged landscape.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.475
The ashes stretched to
the horizon, as far as the eye

27:58.543 --> 28:00.044
can see in all directions.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.880
Fire doesn't discriminate --
It burns everything...

28:02.947 --> 28:04.548
or does it?

28:06.284 --> 28:09.119
NARRATOR: A gleaming white
shrine with a cross on it

28:09.187 --> 28:12.222
stands on a small, unburned
patch of land.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.371
Like the whole area is
charred, except for

28:27.439 --> 28:32.509
this one shining, bright white
shrine that just stands out.

28:32.577 --> 28:35.546
Even in a fire,
you would expect that, if it

28:35.613 --> 28:37.214
wasn't burned,
this shrine would at least

28:37.282 --> 28:39.783
be covered in ash,
covered in soot.

28:39.851 --> 28:42.686
But it's nothing,
it's totally perfect.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.421
SZULGIT: There's something
weird going on here.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.658
Like, there's some invisible
force protecting this.

28:49.961 --> 28:54.765
NARRATOR: Coming up, has this
shrine been saved by divine

28:54.833 --> 28:57.401
intervention or by the mob?

28:57.469 --> 28:59.470
GOTTLIEB:
Looks like a miracle...

28:59.537 --> 29:03.140
but there could be something
a little more sinister going on.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.776
NARRATOR:
And a security camera captures

29:05.810 --> 29:09.413
strange beings stalking
a suburban driveway.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.249
ORZEL: Little creatures waddling
around beams of light.

29:12.317 --> 29:15.018
It's hard not to make the jump
to thinking they're aliens.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.194
NARRATOR: A firefighter
in Argentina

29:24.262 --> 29:26.430
films an incredible sight.

29:26.464 --> 29:29.399
A wildfire tears through
a field, leaving

29:29.467 --> 29:33.203
a gleaming white shrine
mysteriously untouched by

29:33.271 --> 29:34.538
the flames.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.885
NARRATOR: Religious objects
and even people

29:47.952 --> 29:50.521
have been reported to
miraculously survive

29:50.588 --> 29:52.489
heat and flames before.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.859
St. John the Apostle,
the last of Jesus's

29:55.927 --> 29:58.362
close allies, was said
to have been plunged

29:58.429 --> 30:03.066
into hot, boiling oil but to
have emerged unscathed.

30:03.134 --> 30:07.137
His follower, St. Polycarp,
was tied to the stake

30:07.205 --> 30:12.309
and set aflame, but allegedly,
the flames refused to actually

30:12.377 --> 30:14.378
touch his body.

30:14.445 --> 30:17.147
NARRATOR: Even today,
religious objects appear to

30:17.215 --> 30:20.851
have been spared destruction
in inexplicable ways.

30:20.919 --> 30:23.587
BELLINGER:
After 9-11, firefighters found

30:23.655 --> 30:25.722
a Bible fused to a piece of

30:25.790 --> 30:29.459
molten metal in an area where
everything else around it

30:29.527 --> 30:31.595
was completely obliterated.

30:31.662 --> 30:36.133
The Bible was open to Matthew,
chapter five,

30:36.201 --> 30:37.968
the Sermon on the Mount.

30:38.036 --> 30:40.571
To believers, this would be

30:40.638 --> 30:43.674
sure proof of God's power --
To destroy,

30:43.741 --> 30:47.411
when he so chooses,
but also to preserve.

30:47.478 --> 30:50.681
NARRATOR: Investigation
of the tragic story

30:50.748 --> 30:53.317
behind the shrine deepens
the mystery.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.854
This is a shrine to
a 13-year-old girl,

30:56.921 --> 31:00.290
put up after her tragic death
in an auto accident.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.026
It's nowhere near
the road where she died.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.662
So you have to ask yourself,
why is it there?

31:05.730 --> 31:08.532
Looks like a miracle,
but there could

31:08.600 --> 31:11.869
be something a little more
sinister going on.

31:13.238 --> 31:16.506
NARRATOR: Historian Craig
Gottlieb suspects that something

31:16.574 --> 31:20.477
insidious might be buried
beneath the field.

31:20.511 --> 31:23.347
There's got to be something
underground that's preventing

31:23.414 --> 31:26.483
the fire from spreading into
this particular spot.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.986
NARRATOR:
Many hazardous chemicals have

31:29.053 --> 31:30.787
fire-retardant properties.

31:30.855 --> 31:33.123
Could it be that
there's toxic waste under

31:33.191 --> 31:36.460
the shrine, and that's what's
causing the fire not to burn?

31:36.527 --> 31:38.729
NARRATOR: Argentina is
a nation that could

31:38.796 --> 31:41.331
become the world's hazardous
waste dump.

31:41.399 --> 31:45.636
Armstrong, where the shrine is,
is just up from

31:45.703 --> 31:47.938
Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires

31:48.006 --> 31:50.507
has a huge problem with waste,

31:50.575 --> 31:53.911
and this waste
isn't just homegrown.

31:53.945 --> 31:57.581
President Mauricio Macri
signed a decree allowing

31:57.615 --> 32:01.618
the import of toxic waste
into the country in 2019.

32:03.454 --> 32:05.555
NARRATOR: Around the world,
mobsters get their

32:05.623 --> 32:08.325
hands dirty making money
from trash.

32:09.460 --> 32:13.196
In Italy, the Mafia was
earning $16 billion dollars

32:13.264 --> 32:15.632
a year collecting garbage
from cities

32:15.700 --> 32:19.369
and then illegally dumping it
all over the countryside.

32:20.538 --> 32:23.974
A recent Interpol report
indicates that Buenos Aires

32:24.042 --> 32:26.243
has become a key stomping ground

32:26.311 --> 32:29.379
of organized crime in Argentina.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.281
Could the shrine be on top of
an illegal

32:31.349 --> 32:33.784
trash dumping site that's
poisoning the environment

32:33.851 --> 32:34.751
from miles everywhere?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.254
I don't know what is more sad --
That this

32:37.322 --> 32:40.557
could be evidence of
an illegal landfill

32:40.625 --> 32:44.127
or deceased a girl's shrine
sits on top of it.

32:44.195 --> 32:47.097
NARRATOR: The farmer and the man
who put up the shrine might

32:47.131 --> 32:50.600
have unwittingly been used by
illegal garbage dumpers to

32:50.668 --> 32:52.502
cover their tracks.

32:52.570 --> 32:55.205
But investigations of
the field have yet to reveal

32:55.273 --> 32:59.309
any proof of flame-retardant
chemicals in the soil,

32:59.377 --> 33:01.478
and many locals see
the survival of

33:01.546 --> 33:05.449
the shrine as evidence of
divine intervention.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.785
A miracle, a toxic landfill --

33:08.853 --> 33:11.621
Perhaps we'll never know
for sure.

33:15.159 --> 33:18.061
NARRATOR: Now, Dallas, Texas.

33:23.801 --> 33:27.437
August 28th, 2020,
5:31 a.m.

33:27.505 --> 33:31.808
A security camera covers
a suburban driveway.

33:32.944 --> 33:36.413
BONDAR: It seems like a calm,
normal night in this Texas

33:36.481 --> 33:39.616
suburb... until suddenly,
these two

33:39.684 --> 33:42.052
very strange creatures appear.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.589
SANFORD:
They are really bizarre.

33:45.656 --> 33:47.991
They appear to be
about two feet tall,

33:48.059 --> 33:51.328
crouched over like
demonic gremlins.

33:51.396 --> 33:53.397
NARRATOR: The intruders
stalk the driveway

33:53.464 --> 33:55.032
with an unknown purpose.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.870
The more I watch this,
the creepier it gets.

34:00.004 --> 34:02.706
What are these highly
unusual creatures?

34:02.774 --> 34:05.308
And where did they come from?

34:05.376 --> 34:08.045
NARRATOR: And then, one of them
shoots something.

34:10.681 --> 34:11.915
Whoa!

34:11.983 --> 34:13.884
I did not expect it to do that.

34:15.753 --> 34:16.820
That's crazy.

34:17.955 --> 34:20.791
What is that strange light
being shot into the sky?

34:20.858 --> 34:23.660
Looks almost like
a missile firing out.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.196
Could that be some kind of
a laser gun

34:26.264 --> 34:27.998
or communication device?

34:28.065 --> 34:30.867
Little creatures waddling
around beams of light.

34:30.935 --> 34:33.870
It's hard not to make the jump
to thinking they're aliens.

34:38.142 --> 34:41.344
NARRATOR: Biologist Carin Bondar
believes that these nighttime

34:41.412 --> 34:45.048
intruders could have
come from the skies.

34:45.116 --> 34:49.152
The way these creatures are
moving, coupled the stocky shape

34:49.220 --> 34:52.289
and the size remind me of
a very particular

34:52.356 --> 34:54.458
nocturnal bird -- the owl.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.693
[owl calls]

34:56.761 --> 34:59.729
NARRATOR: Texas has at least
11 species of owl,

34:59.797 --> 35:02.132
and these birds are built
for killing.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.435
If these owls are stalking
this house,

35:05.503 --> 35:08.004
the owners better make sure
that they've got their pets

35:08.072 --> 35:10.941
inside -- owls are well known to

35:11.008 --> 35:14.010
attack anything that will make
a good meal.

35:14.078 --> 35:18.014
In 2009, Sadie the Pomeranian
was snatched

35:18.049 --> 35:20.817
by a hungry owl
in Davenport, Iowa.

35:21.853 --> 35:25.188
Owls are very territorial
and have been known to attack

35:25.256 --> 35:28.592
humans, unprovoked, just for
being in their territory.

35:28.659 --> 35:31.895
Owls attack their prey
with such force,

35:31.963 --> 35:36.066
it's akin to a human being
struck by an 18 wheeler.

35:36.134 --> 35:40.203
NARRATOR: In 2014, the citizens
of Purmerend in the Netherlands

35:40.271 --> 35:43.373
are subjected to
a year-long reign of terror

35:43.474 --> 35:45.475
by a European eagle owl.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.211
MAN: He flew towards us,

35:48.279 --> 35:52.549
and he attacked my client,
and he got my client

35:52.617 --> 35:56.086
here at the back
and he wounded her

35:56.154 --> 35:59.623
with the -- at the cheek.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.158
NARRATOR:
Over a 12-month period,

36:01.225 --> 36:04.561
this owl is responsible for
more than 50 attacks

36:04.629 --> 36:08.231
that leave many of its victims
bloodied and bruised.

36:09.567 --> 36:13.603
When we go out at night
or when it's dark,

36:13.671 --> 36:17.474
we go out only
with umbrellas with us.

36:17.542 --> 36:18.909
It doesn't detect them.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.680
This looks like a scene
out of a horror film.

36:23.748 --> 36:27.784
Having owls get up close and
personal with your property

36:27.851 --> 36:30.187
could spell bad news.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.989
NARRATOR: But normal owls
don't fire a light beam

36:33.057 --> 36:35.192
like the creature
in the footage.

36:35.259 --> 36:38.328
The streak of light
that shoots up --

36:38.396 --> 36:40.397
What could that possibly be?

36:46.704 --> 36:48.838
NARRATOR: Coming up,
could these nighttime

36:48.906 --> 36:52.409
intruders be armed with
deadly weapons?

36:52.476 --> 36:53.877
The liquid that they are able to

36:53.945 --> 36:56.546
project is as effective
as tear gas.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.089
NARRATOR: A security camera
in suburban Dallas

37:06.157 --> 37:10.460
captures mysterious beings
prowling a property.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.362
Then, one of the creatures fires

37:12.430 --> 37:15.432
a glowing projectile
into the night.

37:15.499 --> 37:19.502
Physicist Chad Orzel takes
a closer look at the footage.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.305
So on the first viewing,
it certainly looks like these

37:22.373 --> 37:25.475
creatures are shooting some
kind of laser into the sky.

37:25.543 --> 37:28.144
Lasers are different
than ordinary light sources

37:28.212 --> 37:30.513
in that the light
waves are coherent, and this

37:30.581 --> 37:33.817
allows them to be focused into
a very tight beam that stays

37:33.884 --> 37:36.286
together all in
the same direction.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.787
Lasers are a great way of

37:37.855 --> 37:40.957
sending communication signals
over very long distances,

37:40.992 --> 37:42.459
and NASA has experimented with

37:42.526 --> 37:44.427
using them for
space communication,

37:44.462 --> 37:46.896
but is that what we're seeing
in this video?

37:48.899 --> 37:51.701
NARRATOR: Orzel freezes
the video and notices

37:51.769 --> 37:53.970
that the beam shot
by the creatures

37:54.038 --> 37:56.439
doesn't stay
together as a laser would,

37:56.507 --> 37:58.541
but it separates.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.577
He wonders if
the type of security

38:00.645 --> 38:03.847
camera used could explain
the bright beam.

38:03.914 --> 38:06.316
This monochrome recording
looks like something from

38:06.384 --> 38:09.286
a night vision camera, which
records in the infrared --

38:09.353 --> 38:12.389
That's a wavelength that's not
visible to our eyes.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.790
When using infrared light,

38:13.858 --> 38:15.992
things are not always
as they seem.

38:16.060 --> 38:19.729
Highly reflective materials
can become much brighter,

38:19.797 --> 38:23.466
and what looks like a laser beam
could just be some more

38:23.534 --> 38:27.504
ordinary object that reflects
very well in the infrared.

38:27.571 --> 38:29.205
I think what we're seeing
here could

38:29.240 --> 38:32.509
be the spray from some sort
of liquid.

38:32.576 --> 38:36.012
NARRATOR: Orzel believes
the projectile is a spray of

38:36.080 --> 38:39.983
liquid glowing in the infrared
night vision of the camera.

38:40.051 --> 38:43.553
He comes up with an experiment
to test his theory.

38:43.621 --> 38:47.257
I have here a small syringe
full of water

38:47.325 --> 38:49.459
that I will take and squirt

38:49.527 --> 38:52.295
across the field of view of
the camera when it's in

38:52.363 --> 38:53.663
its night vision mode.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.932
And let's see what that water
looks like when

38:56.000 --> 38:59.035
it's lit up by the infrared
light on the camera.

38:59.103 --> 39:01.538
So now I'm gonna switch
the lights off

39:01.605 --> 39:03.773
so the camera will go into
its night mode,

39:03.841 --> 39:06.509
and in night vision mode,
we'll squirt liquid

39:06.577 --> 39:07.877
across the field of view.

39:07.945 --> 39:09.579
[squirting noise]

39:11.716 --> 39:13.383
And then let's see
what that looks like.

39:13.451 --> 39:15.118
[squirting noise]

39:15.186 --> 39:17.120
[squirting noise]

39:17.188 --> 39:19.089
Yeah, there it is.

39:19.156 --> 39:20.890
It's very quick in real time.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.158
But if we slow it down,

39:22.193 --> 39:25.195
we see the stream of water
looks very bright in the light

39:25.262 --> 39:26.296
from the camera.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.032
So what we're seeing in
the video is probably

39:29.100 --> 39:32.602
a stream of liquid being
jetted out by these creatures.

39:40.144 --> 39:43.613
Biologist Jayde Lovell
believes one notorious local

39:43.681 --> 39:47.183
resident might fit the profile
of Orzel's theory.

39:47.251 --> 39:51.121
What animals do we know that
live in Texas and are known to

39:51.188 --> 39:53.890
shoot liquid at high velocity?

39:53.958 --> 39:57.394
And the obvious answer is
it could be a skunk.

39:57.461 --> 39:59.863
NARRATOR: A skunk's liquid spray
is one of

39:59.897 --> 40:03.767
the most powerful chemical
weapons found in any mammal.

40:03.834 --> 40:07.237
Skunks are very effective
at deterring predators.

40:07.304 --> 40:08.638
The liquid that they are able to

40:08.706 --> 40:12.475
project is as effective
as tear gas.

40:12.510 --> 40:15.645
NARRATOR: A skunk emits its
spray from scent glands located

40:15.712 --> 40:18.748
inside its rectum,
and it can fire jets

40:18.816 --> 40:23.052
of this noxious liquid over
a distance of up to 10 feet.

40:23.120 --> 40:27.257
The vile excretion contains
thiols, the same sulfur-based

40:27.324 --> 40:28.958
compounds that give onions

40:29.026 --> 40:31.060
their eye-watering effect.

40:31.128 --> 40:34.798
But the thiols in skunk spray
are much more potent.

40:34.865 --> 40:38.968
They stink like rotting
carcasses, and the spray can

40:39.036 --> 40:40.937
cause temporary blindness,

40:41.005 --> 40:43.506
coughing, and vomiting.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.209
NARRATOR: The stench is
so powerful that it

40:46.277 --> 40:48.878
can be detected
from over a mile away.

40:48.946 --> 40:52.148
SANFORD: Skunks target
the nose and the mouth.

40:52.216 --> 40:53.716
At high enough doses,

40:53.784 --> 40:56.886
it can even be lethal to humans.

40:56.954 --> 41:00.390
NARRATOR: The thiols in skunk
spray are highly toxic.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.393
Scientists have reported that
they have an aesthetic

41:03.461 --> 41:04.861
properties that in high

41:04.929 --> 41:07.664
concentrations can
cause unconsciousness,

41:07.731 --> 41:10.333
lower pulse rate,
and eventually, death.

41:10.401 --> 41:13.269
Knowing how effective
skunk spray is,

41:13.337 --> 41:14.804
you definitely don't want to
be wandering

41:14.872 --> 41:17.474
around outside in Texas
with these boys around.

41:18.542 --> 41:20.777
NARRATOR: As powerful
as skunk spray is,

41:20.845 --> 41:23.680
it's also a weapon of
last resort.

41:23.747 --> 41:26.015
It can take a skunk
up to 10 days to

41:26.083 --> 41:30.553
replenish the foul musk after
it has emptied its glands.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.989
So a pair of skunks alone on
a quiet

41:33.057 --> 41:36.326
suburban Dallas street
wouldn't be spraying without

41:36.393 --> 41:38.328
good reason.

41:38.362 --> 41:41.364
These animals are
displaying behaviors

41:41.432 --> 41:43.700
that make me think
they feel threatened.

41:43.767 --> 41:46.336
The fact that I can't see
in the camera

41:46.403 --> 41:51.508
whatever is making them so
nervous, makes me nervous.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.376
NARRATOR:
What else might be lurking

41:53.444 --> 41:55.545
just beyond the view
of the lens?

41:55.613 --> 41:58.114
There are strange things that
come out at night.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.583
So be careful when you're out
there on the streets.
