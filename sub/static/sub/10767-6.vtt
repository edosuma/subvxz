WEBVTT

00:01.980 --> 00:03.333
Everything is fine, Vivian.

00:03.540 --> 00:06.179
Tell Ashley and Nicky
that I miss them too.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.297
Okay? Okay, love you.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.815
Oh, kiss your sister for me.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.528
God knows I wouldn't do it.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.577
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.096
Well, Daddy, L.A.'s favorite weather girl
is ready to go back to work.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.616
- With that on?
- Oh, I know, I'm tired of black too...

00:23.780 --> 00:26.852
...but I want the public to know
I'm still mourning Trevor's death.

00:27.020 --> 00:31.013
You know, I just don't think that black
is the right color for this kind of heat.

00:31.180 --> 00:34.092
Oh, don't worry, Daddy,
this dress is surprisingly cool.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.933
It's like I'm wearing
practically nothing.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.932
She's not my daughter.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:54.860 --> 01:57.215
Dad, when are you gonna get
the air conditioner fixed?

01:57.380 --> 01:59.052
It's sweltering in our place.

01:59.220 --> 02:03.577
Yeah, man, it's so hot out there
the Uh-Huh Girls just went:

02:04.740 --> 02:07.698
Everybody keeps talking
about this heat wave.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.011
Maybe I should mention it
in today's weather report.

02:15.500 --> 02:19.015
You know, that girl
has got the mind of Willard Scott.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.456
Hey. Come to think of it,
you got his body. Y'all should team up.

02:23.300 --> 02:27.452
No, check it out. On the serious tip,
you got to fix our air conditioner today.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.576
We got some people
coming over for a party.

02:29.740 --> 02:32.493
And as good hosts,
we'd prefer that they didn't melt.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.129
Sorry, Uncle Phil has left the building.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.052
You're now talking
to landlord Banks...

02:37.220 --> 02:40.337
...and he's not fixing anything
until he gets his rent.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.053
You'll get the rent
when we get the air.

02:48.740 --> 02:50.651
What did you say?

02:51.180 --> 02:53.489
I'm sorry, was I talking out loud?

02:57.900 --> 03:00.892
You know what, Uncle Phil?
Forget it, you win.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.290
We'll just move our little
somethin'-somethin'...

03:03.460 --> 03:05.212
...from inside to poolside.

03:05.380 --> 03:06.972
Oh, no, you don't.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.655
No rent, no pool,
no party, no nothing.

03:10.980 --> 03:14.097
What does he mean by "no nothing"?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.649
Oh, don't worry about it,
it's a double negative.

03:22.540 --> 03:25.816
- What's this?
- A bill for your breakfast.

03:26.780 --> 03:30.056
Dad, this is an outrage!
Three dollars for orange juice?

03:30.260 --> 03:35.015
Oh, and I've taken the liberty
of adding a 15-percent gratuity.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.132
Carlton. Of course
you know this means war!

03:40.300 --> 03:44.134
It certainly does.
And we're gonna win, right, Dad?

04:03.660 --> 04:07.573
Girl, let me tell you, switching this
to a pool party was a stroke of genius.

04:07.740 --> 04:08.968
Why do you say that?

04:09.900 --> 04:12.573
Oh, couple of reasons.

04:13.860 --> 04:18.695
Girl, I got to tell you, that suit look like
a piece of "good God"...

04:18.860 --> 04:22.011
...wrapped up in some "have mercy"
with a side of:

04:23.060 --> 04:25.733
Really? I mean,
you don't think it's too revealing?

04:26.180 --> 04:29.855
Well, if it is, your secret's safe with me.
You know? You know?

04:30.020 --> 04:33.296
Come on, let's get out of this heat
before I pop something, you know.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.291
<i>Thank you, Chet.
It's good to be back.</i>

04:35.460 --> 04:38.099
<i>Yes, I'm here at the Farmers Market,
and as you can see...</i>

04:38.260 --> 04:40.216
<i>... my fans haven 't forgotten me.</i>

04:40.380 --> 04:43.213
<i>Why haven 't you answered
any of my letters?</i>

04:44.580 --> 04:47.731
<i>Well, the good news is
the heat wave is over.</i>

04:47.900 --> 04:51.210
<i>L.A. Will have a high tomorrow
of only 65.</i>

04:51.900 --> 04:54.460
<i>Oh, sorry, that "LA"
stands for Louisiana.</i>

04:54.620 --> 04:57.293
<i>Our high will be 112.</i>

04:57.820 --> 05:00.209
<i>Well, they have
the same abbreviation.</i>

05:00.380 --> 05:04.453
<i>This is Hilary Banks surrounded by
ordinary people at the Farmers Market.</i>

05:04.620 --> 05:06.895
<i>Now back to you, Chet.</i>

05:07.060 --> 05:09.096
<i>Don 't any of you touch me.</i>

05:10.620 --> 05:12.497
I can't believe she wore that dress.

05:12.660 --> 05:16.016
- Would you like a Swedish meatball, sir?
- Don't mind if I do.

05:16.180 --> 05:18.535
Only one, sir.

05:18.700 --> 05:22.295
The rest are for Master William
and his friends, poolside.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.739
What? I can't believe that he would
deliberately disobey me!

05:26.900 --> 05:32.452
I wouldn't call it disobedience, sir.
It's more like outright defiance.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.779
That's it!

05:38.740 --> 05:42.528
Dance puppets, dance!

05:43.340 --> 05:44.773
Hi, Carlton.

05:44.940 --> 05:46.578
Hi, Steffi, what are you doing here?

05:46.740 --> 05:49.254
I heard the party and
I came to see if Ashley was home.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.253
Well, she's away at her Aunt Helen's.
Now, run along.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.980
I don't think you're age-appropriate
for this party.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.692
Now...

05:58.580 --> 06:00.616
...if you'll excuse me,
I'm going swimming.

06:03.140 --> 06:06.815
Hey, Will, any sign of Dad yet?

06:07.980 --> 06:09.299
Well...

06:10.100 --> 06:13.775
That's either him or a rhino
that got his horn chopped off.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.776
I'm going swimming
in the neighbor's pool.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.296
Carlton, listen.
We have to stand up to him, man.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.815
If he smells fear, he'll attack.

06:25.100 --> 06:29.218
- How dare you two defy me.
- Now, see here, big guy.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.409
Oh, my God, Howard!

06:39.460 --> 06:40.779
Come on, Will, let's get wet.

06:40.940 --> 06:44.933
Young lady, would you mind putting
on some clothes and going home. Now.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.529
Whoa, baby, baby, baby.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.533
What you doing? You embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.089
You should have thought of that
before you defied me.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.693
Hi, Mr. Banks.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.737
Steffi, do your parents
know you're here?

06:57.940 --> 07:01.376
I don't think so. They're in Aspen.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.055
And I'm in heaven.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.898
She came over here on her own.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.938
Will, I am going back in the house,
and when I come out...

07:11.100 --> 07:13.250
...I want all of these people gone.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.329
Well, they will be if you come out
in the morning, Uncle Phil.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.294
Wait, wait.
Let me get this straight, young man.

07:22.460 --> 07:27.818
You are telling me what will
or will not happen in my own house?

07:28.020 --> 07:30.580
Excuse me, but this is my house.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.300
I pay rent here too, eventually.

07:34.340 --> 07:35.739
You watch how you talk to me.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.368
Well, then, Uncle Phil,
stop treating me like a child.

07:38.540 --> 07:43.170
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize I was talking to a man.

07:43.740 --> 07:46.538
That's right. It's me, Will Smith.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.736
- Oh, well.
- Man.

07:49.540 --> 07:53.533
I guess you're ready
to play a man's game, huh?

07:56.420 --> 08:00.129
All right, Will,
if that's the way you want it.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.249
Don't come back, neither.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.496
G, is Uncle Phil around?

08:28.700 --> 08:31.897
The coast is clear. He's in court.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.210
Geoffrey,
could you get us some breakfast?

08:34.380 --> 08:36.291
I'm not allowed to serve you anymore.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.769
Mr. Banks' orders.

08:40.580 --> 08:44.015
G, listen,
how upset was Uncle Phil last night?

08:44.179 --> 08:47.092
Well, he did something
I've never seen him do...

08:47.260 --> 08:49.854
...in all the years I've been here.

08:50.020 --> 08:52.090
What, a sit-up?

08:56.100 --> 08:59.649
It's a bit more serious than that,
I'm afraid.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.380
You know the cherry cheesecake,
candied yams...

09:02.540 --> 09:04.929
...barbecued ribs left over
from yesterday?

09:05.100 --> 09:06.897
Yeah.

09:08.620 --> 09:11.088
Oh, my goodness, it's still there.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.491
Oh, I'm afraid.

09:14.660 --> 09:17.299
- Hold me, Will.
- Get off of me, man.

09:18.060 --> 09:19.812
I don't know why I ever listen to you.

09:19.980 --> 09:23.256
I was content having my father
push me around for the rest of my life.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.172
Now who knows
what he's gonna do to us.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.570
Relax, man,
what's he gonna do, sue us?

09:27.740 --> 09:31.528
Oh, gosh, now you've gone
and spoiled the surprise.

09:33.940 --> 09:37.489
- What's this?
- Subpoenas from your father.

09:37.660 --> 09:42.051
And may I say,
it's been a pleasure serving you.

09:47.860 --> 09:49.976
Case dismissed.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.329
This is the last case of the day,
number 1218...

09:54.540 --> 09:56.929
<i>...Phillip Banks v. Will Smith
and Carlton Banks...</i>

09:57.100 --> 09:58.453
...for nonpayment of rent.

09:58.620 --> 10:02.295
Philip, I can't believe you're suing
your own son and nephew.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.890
Oh, relax, Lois, this is just
a little lesson in responsibility.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.652
They're probably not gonna show up.

10:07.820 --> 10:10.698
In fact, they're probably home now,
preparing their apologies.

10:23.580 --> 10:26.572
Looks like they've prepared
more than an apology.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.651
Mr. Banks, your opening statement.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.374
I don't have an opening statement.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.810
- Mr. Smith.
- Thank you.

10:35.780 --> 10:40.137
Your Honor, I'm from West Philadelphia,
born and raised.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.768
On the playground
is where I spent most of my days.

10:44.260 --> 10:48.173
I don't have a big bag
of fancy courtroom tricks.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.456
Or a high-priced degree
from Princeton...

10:50.620 --> 10:53.692
...like my worthy adversary,
Judge Philip Banks.

10:53.900 --> 10:57.415
- But what I do have is the truth!
- Oh, shut up, Will!

10:58.220 --> 11:01.417
Your Honor, Mr. Smith is making
a mockery of the entire legal system.

11:01.580 --> 11:05.095
And this man is making a mockery
of a finely cut Italian suit.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.575
Order in the court.

11:10.740 --> 11:14.130
Mr. Banks, will you please call
your first witness.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.133
- I don't have a witness.
- I do, Your Honor.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.768
Fine. Mr. Smith,
call your first witness.

11:19.980 --> 11:26.294
Your Honor, I'd like to call someone
who's not afraid to tell the truth...

11:26.460 --> 11:29.213
...no matter what landlord Banks
might do to him.

11:30.420 --> 11:34.493
Someone who knows
the plaintiff intimately.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.730
Like a son, one might say.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.494
Oh, that's great, Will,
who do we have?

11:41.620 --> 11:43.531
You, dummy.

11:44.220 --> 11:48.008
When we prepared this case, you didn't
say I had to speak against my father.

11:48.180 --> 11:49.533
You don't.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.419
Just read it.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.617
"The night was hot,
forcing our party outdoors.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.294
Will Smith, who is neat,
considerate and responsible...

11:58.460 --> 12:00.530
...smile at me, was having..."

12:01.380 --> 12:02.449
Smile at me?

12:04.100 --> 12:05.931
Oh, I get it.

12:12.300 --> 12:16.134
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Hold it.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.857
I'd like to cross-examine the witness,
Your Honor.

12:20.060 --> 12:22.972
All right, I'm guilty! I'm guilty!

12:23.140 --> 12:26.291
- That will be all.
- You may step down.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.815
Welcome to my turf.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.171
How did I do?

12:37.260 --> 12:40.411
Your Honor, I'd like to call
my next witness, Miss Hilary Banks.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.097
Hi, everybody.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.858
Oh, boy.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.454
Will you please take the stand?

12:48.660 --> 12:50.298
Certainly, Your Honor.

12:51.780 --> 12:53.293
Do you swear to tell the truth...

12:53.460 --> 12:55.291
...so help you God?
- I do.

12:57.580 --> 13:01.892
Okay, Miss Banks,
you were the previous tenant...

13:02.060 --> 13:04.858
...in the aforementioned pool house,
is that correct?

13:05.060 --> 13:06.459
Yes.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.374
And would you please tell us
of your experiences there.

13:14.820 --> 13:16.617
Am I under oath?

13:16.780 --> 13:18.498
Of course.

13:19.740 --> 13:23.528
Well, Trevor would come over at about
3:00 in the morning, and we would...

13:23.740 --> 13:25.537
Objection!

13:30.060 --> 13:33.097
That does it! You may step down.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.649
Mr. Banks, the court
would like to know...

13:35.820 --> 13:39.449
...the impetus for this little lesson
that's being learned, and make it quick.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.498
I have a 5:00 hair appointment.

13:42.660 --> 13:46.494
Your Honor, I will show that my tenants
were openly hostile and defiant...

13:46.660 --> 13:48.935
...leaving me to believe
no rent was forthcoming.

13:49.140 --> 13:52.018
Why, I was reading in my study
late one night...

14:03.260 --> 14:06.218
Yo, yo, man, this party is dumb!

14:06.380 --> 14:07.972
No, man, this party is stupid!

14:08.140 --> 14:12.019
No, no, no, this party is crazy,
fly, dumb, deaf, doogy!

14:12.180 --> 14:15.092
- You the man! You the man!
- You the man!

14:22.220 --> 14:26.054
Hi there.
I see you're having a gathering.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.817
Isn't that wonderful.

14:32.940 --> 14:36.216
Hey, Pops, you popped my duck.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.612
I'm sorry, son. Here, here's $ 100.

14:41.820 --> 14:44.618
Yeah, that's more like it.

14:47.860 --> 14:49.293
Hi.

14:49.460 --> 14:53.851
Will, where's your aunt's gold watch
that you promised me?

14:55.460 --> 14:56.779
In time, baby, in time.

14:56.940 --> 14:59.579
Why don't you go on,
cool off in the pool a little bit?

14:59.740 --> 15:01.332
Go on, girl.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.256
Hey, hey, look, look,
check it out, Heavy P.

15:05.420 --> 15:09.936
Now, why don't you take
your Humpty Dumpty butt...

15:10.100 --> 15:13.570
...on back up to the main house,
because you're embarrassing us out here.

15:13.740 --> 15:14.855
You know what I'm saying?

15:15.020 --> 15:18.774
I understand. Kids don't like to have
adults hanging around their parties, but...

15:18.940 --> 15:20.896
- Word.
- Well, could you...?

15:21.060 --> 15:23.858
Could you turn your music down
just a drop?

15:24.020 --> 15:26.818
We have to consider our neighbors.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.897
I am, dude.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.972
Right now I'm considering
their 15-year-old daughter.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.853
Hi, Mr. Banks.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.052
Steffi, do your parents
know you're here?

15:38.540 --> 15:40.849
To hell with my parents.

15:41.660 --> 15:44.049
Will taught me that.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.010
You know,
she came over here on her own, chief.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.772
Oh, I believe you.

15:49.940 --> 15:52.693
Well, I guess
I better go back in the house.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.339
Well, I know I can trust you.

15:54.500 --> 15:58.459
I know we've had our differences, but,
boy, you're a great kid.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.497
Boy?!

16:00.660 --> 16:03.049
You call me "boy"?
You better step to me like a man!

16:03.220 --> 16:05.575
Now get to stepping!
Now get to stepping!

16:05.780 --> 16:08.055
Okay, Will,
if that's the way you want it.

16:13.780 --> 16:17.056
Oh, please!

16:17.220 --> 16:19.734
Your Honor, that is not the way
it went down.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.016
How did it go down, Mr. Smith?

16:23.060 --> 16:24.698
I'm glad you asked me that question.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.691
Check it out,
the night was so hot...

16:26.860 --> 16:29.215
...people was pulling up
on camels, right?

16:29.380 --> 16:30.369
So listen...

16:50.060 --> 16:55.373
Gayle, would you mind
if I commented on your swimsuit?

16:56.140 --> 16:58.779
Don't tell me, it's too revealing?

16:58.940 --> 17:01.454
Oh, just a little bit, you know.

17:01.620 --> 17:05.579
I've got some old T-shirts in there that
I was gonna drop off for the homeless...

17:05.740 --> 17:08.128
...but you're welcome to put one on
to cover up.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.691
Oh, Will, my parents adore you.

17:13.740 --> 17:17.653
Oh, Gayle, bring out that book of hymns
I was telling you about.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.492
Oh, this heat is unbearable.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.258
I need to take a dip in the pool.

17:26.980 --> 17:30.416
Safety first, my little non-swimmer.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.418
Only if Dad would fix the air conditioner
in the pool house...

17:36.580 --> 17:39.936
...we wouldn't have to be out
in this sweltering heat.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.977
How could he be so cruel?

17:42.140 --> 17:45.052
He's mad, I tell you, mad.

17:47.060 --> 17:50.132
Stop it. You will not speak
of Uncle Phil that way.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.053
He may be an unreasonable,
pigheaded dictator...

17:53.220 --> 17:57.577
...but he is your father and my uncle,
and you will show him some respect.

17:58.860 --> 18:02.057
You're right, Will. Thanks.

18:07.620 --> 18:12.296
It's... It's... It's him.

18:16.980 --> 18:20.177
Do you know how humiliating it is...

18:20.340 --> 18:23.218
...to have a son who can't swim?

18:37.300 --> 18:39.575
- Listen, Uncle Phil...
- Silence.

18:39.780 --> 18:42.533
If I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

18:44.260 --> 18:47.218
- Hello, Mr. Banks.
- What's she doing here?

18:47.940 --> 18:52.138
She wandered over, lonely and crying.
I didn't have the heart to turn her away.

18:52.300 --> 18:56.179
Hit the bricks, you little tramp!
Out of here!

18:56.980 --> 19:00.450
And tell your mother
your father has a girlfriend!

19:00.620 --> 19:03.009
I'm going back into the house,
and when I come out...

19:03.180 --> 19:06.138
...I want all these freeloading parasites
out of here!

19:06.540 --> 19:08.098
Yes, sir, within the hour.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.569
- Five minutes!
- Four.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.900
All right, Will...

19:14.060 --> 19:17.575
...if that's the way you want it.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.412
And then he slapped me
with a subpoena.

19:29.380 --> 19:32.736
- Thank you, Mr. Smith.
- You're welcome.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.809
Mr. Banks,
will you please approach the bench.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.735
Is that victory I smell?

19:47.260 --> 19:51.253
I am disappointed in you for allowing
your family relationship to come to this.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.928
- That's what we saying.
- Shame.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.614
Yeah, ju... Oh, shame.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.459
In lieu of a written lease,
the law stipulates...

19:59.620 --> 20:04.091
...a landlord must provide his tenants
with electricity, gas and plumbing.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.733
Yeah.

20:05.940 --> 20:10.331
However, air conditioning
is considered a luxury.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.732
Rent cannot be withheld
based on a malfunctioning appliance.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.293
Meaning?

20:18.620 --> 20:21.453
- Meaning you'll have to pay the rent.
- Yes!

20:22.100 --> 20:25.490
This will be a good one
for the cocktail parties, Philip.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.331
We're going to appeal this decision.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.493
<i>I intend to cite the landmark case
of Rhode Island v. Schechter Poultry.</i>

20:37.700 --> 20:40.419
That has to do with
the right to hang dead chickens...

20:40.580 --> 20:42.650
...in a butcher-shop window.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.136
Well, then,
you see where I'm going with this.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.771
Guess this whole thing got
a little out of hand, huh?

20:59.940 --> 21:01.771
Yeah.

21:01.940 --> 21:03.419
Will...

21:04.220 --> 21:09.658
Look, let's try not to let this
ever happen again, huh?

21:12.300 --> 21:14.689
I don't want your hand,
I want my rent.

21:15.660 --> 21:17.093
Oh, man, I don't believe...

21:17.260 --> 21:19.091
Did you learn nothing
from all this mess?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.177
Yeah, never rent to relatives.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.970
What did we go through
this whole episode for?

21:25.140 --> 21:27.779
- Money.
- Well, you could at least say you're sorry.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.090
Not until you say it first.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.213
Will you please take the stand?

21:36.380 --> 21:38.371
Certainly, Your Honor.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.173
Do you swear to tell the truth,
so help you God?

21:43.340 --> 21:44.659
I'm sorry.
