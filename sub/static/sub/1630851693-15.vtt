WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:01.834
We're gonna go again.
Camera four.

00:01.836 --> 00:02.768
<i>[Shaun] Tonight...</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:04.069
Nice to meet you, I'm Shaun.

00:04.071 --> 00:06.005
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, too, Shaun.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.807
[Shaun] The Other Way
<i>couples tell all.</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:09.742
[Steven] Hey!

00:09.744 --> 00:11.110
How are you guys?

00:12.278 --> 00:14.780
[Shaun]
<i>Everyone is getting real.</i>

00:14.782 --> 00:17.116
Steven, it's not fair to have
one foot in the door

00:17.118 --> 00:18.550
and one foot out the door.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.985
That's kinda funny

00:19.987 --> 00:22.955
coming from someone who
just abandoned their husband.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.556
I didn't abandon my husband.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.059
Please, I can't take
the bull[bleep].

00:28.962 --> 00:30.996
<i>[Shaun] And emotions
are running high.</i>

00:32.899 --> 00:37.036
[voice breaking]

00:38.171 --> 00:39.405
What's next for you guys?

00:45.045 --> 00:45.977
Whoa!

00:47.747 --> 00:49.314
<i>[Shaun] The culture
clashes continue.</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:50.582
In Mexico, in our culture,

00:50.584 --> 00:54.853
it's more like you have your
own kids, your blood children.

00:54.855 --> 00:58.123
I think we're just opposed to
you guys having, like, a baby.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.225
That's literally starting over.

01:01.428 --> 01:04.863
This is the first time that
they're not fully on board.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.298
I don't like the thought of it.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.735
[Kenny sobs]

01:09.737 --> 01:11.804
<i>[Shaun] Secrets are exposed.</i>

01:11.806 --> 01:13.739
I have a lot of sexual energy
so, like,

01:13.741 --> 01:18.210
there is a lot of repression
going on within myself.

01:18.212 --> 01:22.281
For some reason, I really
want to have a threesome.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.415
Oh, God.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.117
Whoa!

01:25.985 --> 01:27.186
I didn't know how to react.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.791
[Shaun] Steven's
ex-girlfriend, Vanessa,

01:32.793 --> 01:35.961
has some things
she wants to tell Alina.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.097
Everyone please welcome Vanessa.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.364
[exhales nervously]

01:40.700 --> 01:44.136
<i>[Shaun] And relationships
are put to the test.</i>

01:44.138 --> 01:47.306
It's not the first person
that cheats in the world.

01:47.373 --> 01:47.906
You know?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.441
Who never cheat here?

01:53.046 --> 01:56.181
<i>[Ariela] I think that's a man
who justifies something to himself.</i>

01:58.084 --> 01:59.184
Do you trust him?

01:59.886 --> 02:00.852
Um...

02:04.390 --> 02:06.959
<i>[Shaun] From heated
conversations...</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:09.628
Why don't you guys stop involving
yourself in our relationship?

02:09.630 --> 02:10.862
You guys are jealous.

02:12.932 --> 02:15.968
No, you guys are jealous of
him and you're jealous of me.

02:16.002 --> 02:16.902
They're just jealous.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.337
[Ariela] That's who they are.

02:24.844 --> 02:25.844
<i>[Shaun] To shocking
confessions...</i>

02:25.879 --> 02:27.279
Sumit,

02:27.281 --> 02:30.282
do your parents know
you're married?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.054
- [woman] Today?
- Wow!

02:36.056 --> 02:39.057
I'd like to say hello
to Sadhna and Anil.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.125
How are you?

02:40.160 --> 02:40.726
Fine.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.060
[Ellie] Uh-oh!

02:42.062 --> 02:46.331
Sumit, is there anything you
want to say to your parents?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.002
<i>[Shaun] It's all happening...</i>

02:50.904 --> 02:52.070
<i>Right now!</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:36.181
[chuckling] Yeah.

03:45.525 --> 03:49.061
Alina can't be here today
because she doesn't have a visa.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.566
Since we've been married,
Alina and I's relationship has been

03:54.568 --> 03:57.336
a lot better than I was
expecting married life to be.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.340
But I think trust is still
a really big issue.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.344
I honestly feel like everyone's
gonna be roasting me the whole time.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.280
I know I will!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.216
Yeah, I've already got a list.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.951
[laughs]

04:14.821 --> 04:16.421
<i>[Kenny] It's amazing to be here</i>

04:16.423 --> 04:18.223
and I'm very excited
to meet everybody.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.158
How you doing?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.360
See how the day goes.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.262
Nice to meet you.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.130
Kenny.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.333
I assume Ellie's here if
you're here, right? [laughs]

04:28.501 --> 04:30.168
[both laugh]

04:31.704 --> 04:33.972
Don't tell Kenny I said it, I think
he looks a little bit older in person

04:33.974 --> 04:36.041
than he does on the TV.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.779
[indistinct conversations]

04:40.781 --> 04:43.382
[crew member 1] Great work,
team, thank you for your patience.

04:45.685 --> 04:50.389
Can you guys hear me?
One, two, three, four, five.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.792
Yeah, I can hear you. Okay.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.427
We can hear you.

05:00.867 --> 05:04.269
Our wedding was one of
the best days of my life.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.941
<i>[Corey] But since then,
it's been really bad.</i>

05:10.910 --> 05:13.045
It has been very difficult
for Evelin.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.083
She mentioned that
I'm on very thin ice.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.659
Things between me and Corey
are rough right now

05:27.661 --> 05:28.694
'cause he promised
when we got married

05:28.696 --> 05:30.862
that I know everything
that needs to be known,

05:30.864 --> 05:33.231
and there's more things
that I'm finding out.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.235
So I'm just hoping that
I don't get bad surprises.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.073
[Ellie] How's it going?

05:41.075 --> 05:44.109
- I guess you two can sit together.
- [all laugh]

05:46.412 --> 05:48.947
Have you seen Ari and Biniyam?

05:48.949 --> 05:52.718
Did they get the K-1 visa or I
wonder if they're still back in Africa?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.986
[Ellie laughs]

05:59.726 --> 06:02.994
[woman] All right, guys. So,
are we ready to get started?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.096
- Right now?
- [woman] Uh-huh.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.997
- Okay.
- [Ellie laughs] Yeah.

06:05.999 --> 06:06.698
[woman] Let's go.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.300
[Victor speaking]

06:14.006 --> 06:15.974
- Proceed down there.
- [Kenny] Okay.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.176
[laughs]

06:18.178 --> 06:22.047
- [Kenny] You look cute.
- You do, too.

06:22.049 --> 06:26.084
Wow. They're bouncy.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.087
- [Shaun] Hi, guys. Hi.
- Hi.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.790
- Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Shaun.
- Hi.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.992
[Victor]
Nice to meet you, Shaun.

06:37.296 --> 06:41.600
- Can you see me, baby?
- I can see you.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.101
Jenny and Sumit,
can you hear me?

06:43.103 --> 06:45.937
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we can hear you.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.040
- Hi, Evelin.
- Hi.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.843
Hey, nice to meet you.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.579
Evelin, I think this is the most
modest I've ever seen you dress.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.949
Oh, my God. Whoa, Steven.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.986
It's not...
No, it's just a fact.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.122
- [Victor laughing]
- Oh, my God.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.969
- Whoa, they're here.
- Ah.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.971
Hey, guys.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.475
- [Shaun] Hi. Hi Bini. How are you?
- [Biniyam] How are you?

07:23.477 --> 07:28.013
Ariela looking hotter
than ever. Love it.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.719
Like, hottest girl on the air
at all, for sure.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.088
That dress is a killer.

07:38.057 --> 07:41.393
And your body? Oh, my God.
Too hot to handle. [laughs]

07:42.829 --> 07:44.396
Well, thank you, Evelin.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.700
[man] If everyone's feeling
good we're going to go for it.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.368
We're rolling.

07:53.406 --> 07:59.077
Coming in with Shaun
in five, four, three...

07:59.079 --> 08:03.482
Hello and welcome to <i>90 Day Fiance:
The Other Way The Couples Tell All.</i>

08:03.484 --> 08:07.486
I'm Shaun Robinson. We have
our six couples here with us today

08:07.488 --> 08:11.823
either in studio or joining us
remotely from all over the world.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.893
These Americans have all
made the decision to leave the US

08:14.895 --> 08:16.728
and move abroad for love.

08:16.730 --> 08:21.399
From personality clashes to cultural
differences and language barriers,

08:21.401 --> 08:24.135
they've had to fight
for their love.

08:24.137 --> 08:29.975
It's time for them to get real
and tell all, so let's get right into it.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.644
Ariela and Biniyam.

08:32.646 --> 08:36.081
I think one of
the biggest surprises

08:36.083 --> 08:40.018
- is that you two are here together.
- Yeah.

08:40.953 --> 08:46.291
[Shaun] Last we saw you, Bini,
you were going back to Ethiopia

08:46.293 --> 08:48.126
for your K-1 interview.

08:48.128 --> 08:52.464
Ariela, you decide to stay
behind. What happened after that?

08:52.466 --> 08:56.968
You know, I'm always there
for Bini. I always want to help him

08:56.970 --> 09:04.042
and I couldn't stay away, so in the end I
did go back for the K-1 visa appointment.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.411
Did you get the K-1?

09:06.413 --> 09:09.814
- What do you think?
- Yes.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.516
- You did. You got it.
- He did.

09:11.518 --> 09:15.387
- [all applauding]
- Bravo.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.791
- And now you're living here in the US?
- Yes.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.660
Yeah!

09:21.662 --> 09:24.763
Ari and Bini, we're gonna
get more into your story,

09:24.765 --> 09:27.632
but now I want to move over
to Corey and Evelin.

09:27.634 --> 09:32.604
You two have had a lot of ups
and downs in your relationship.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.307
What was it like for you to
look back during this season?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.578
It's been really,
really hard, actually.

09:39.580 --> 09:45.717
It just has been a real
big strain on our marriage.

09:45.719 --> 09:50.522
Evelin, what kind of emotions were brought
up while you were watching this season?

09:50.524 --> 09:55.560
I'm upset that he made me go
through that. The emotions are so real,

09:55.562 --> 09:59.264
and for me to see me
like that, I'm like... shock.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.302
Mmm-hmm, okay. We're going
to get more into your story.

10:04.304 --> 10:09.608
Definitely a lot to talk about
there. Steven and Alina.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.210
What were you thinking as you
were watching some of the events

10:12.212 --> 10:14.379
that played out
in your relationship?

10:15.314 --> 10:16.748
Um...

10:16.750 --> 10:20.619
I definitely feel like I'm the
worst person in this room.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.422
- Wow. Okay.
- Except for maybe Corey.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.158
- [all laughing]
- [man] Oh, my God.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.395
- Technically, I'm not in the room.
- [Steven] Okay.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.429
[all laughing]

10:31.431 --> 10:33.898
Alina was nodding in agreement.

10:33.900 --> 10:40.772
Yeah, because that's true.
Nothing really changed, so...

10:40.774 --> 10:43.108
- [Victor] Oh.
- [Ellie] Nothing really changed?

10:43.275 --> 10:45.043
- Wow.
- Oh.

10:45.045 --> 10:49.214
Why do you think that Steven
is the worst person in the room?

10:49.248 --> 10:51.182
Um...

10:51.184 --> 10:56.888
I don't support this kind of
communication with opposite sex and...

10:56.890 --> 11:03.128
Steven doesn't listen to me and he
doesn't want to see my point of view.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.431
I am listening to you
and I love you,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.299
and your opinion
means so much to me.

11:08.301 --> 11:14.873
It's just I feel like right now you're,
like, really putting me on the spot.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.743
I gave you control over, you know,
my social media. I deleted my Facebook.

11:18.745 --> 11:22.113
[Steven]
What else do you want?

11:22.115 --> 11:26.685
Alina, is there something more that
has happened than what we have seen

11:26.687 --> 11:29.120
play out during the season?

11:29.122 --> 11:34.259
- Are you still talking to girls online?
- [others laughing]

11:36.495 --> 11:38.797
- So?
- [Ellie laughs]

11:38.799 --> 11:43.234
Let's ask someone else some
questions first. Is that okay, Shaun?

11:43.236 --> 11:46.738
You're not Shaun.
You can't say that.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.840
Steven?

11:48.842 --> 11:51.843
[speaking Russian]

11:51.845 --> 11:53.912
Oh, my God. Not in Russian.
[laughs]

11:53.914 --> 11:55.647
Yeah, we all want to understand.

11:55.649 --> 11:58.583
Yeah, in English, please.

11:58.585 --> 12:05.557
It's hard, especially
when it's so fresh.

12:05.559 --> 12:10.095
It's better for you to confess.
Just do it. Just be a man.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.998
Steven, have you been
talking to other women?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.435
[Corey groans]

12:22.775 --> 12:24.943
<i>[Shaun] Coming up...</i>

12:24.945 --> 12:27.879
Just two days before Steven
left to meet up with Alina

12:27.881 --> 12:34.552
in Turkey to marry her, he chose to
meet up with his ex-girlfriend, Vanessa.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.856
Alina, we know that you
and Vanessa have never met.

12:37.858 --> 12:41.126
Are you comfortable meeting
with Vanessa right now?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.995
[exhales deeply]

12:43.997 --> 12:45.930
<i>[Shaun] And later...</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:47.599
Do you realize, Leandro,

12:47.601 --> 12:51.770
that you are causing problems
in their relationship?

12:51.772 --> 12:56.841
If I was a girl best friend
with Ari would that bother you?

12:56.843 --> 13:00.812
No, because it bothers me
you're Ari's ex-husband.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.413
Yeah, because
that's the reality.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.649
What if I tell you "back off"?

13:04.651 --> 13:07.218
What? She has to tell me.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.026
Steven, have you been
talking to other women?

13:17.830 --> 13:19.230
[speaking Russian]

13:19.232 --> 13:20.665
[chuckles]

13:20.667 --> 13:23.835
Why do you keep
talking to her in Russian?

13:23.837 --> 13:26.938
Because I want to
make sure she's okay with it

13:26.940 --> 13:28.907
because I'm already
in a pretty bad situation.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.408
[laughs]

13:30.410 --> 13:35.346
Steven, this is
<i>The Couples Tell All.</i>

13:42.855 --> 13:44.422
[sighs] Uh...

13:44.623 --> 13:46.524
Yes, I have been.

13:46.526 --> 13:51.963
- Okay? So that's the deal. I've been talking.
- [all laughing]

13:51.965 --> 13:56.201
[Shaun] I want to make sure
everybody realizes, okay, we're laughing,

13:56.203 --> 13:58.369
- but they're married, okay?
- [Victor] Oh, yeah.

14:00.639 --> 14:04.542
Alina and I had got in a fight
recently and I was really frustrated.

14:04.544 --> 14:09.781
And, like, last week,
probably about...

14:09.783 --> 14:15.520
nine girls were sending me inappropriate
messages and images of like, you know,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.022
their boobs and naked pictures.

14:18.024 --> 14:23.394
I started responding back, you
know, kind of, encouraging that.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.631
Oh, my God. That's so bad.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.034
[Shaun] So you've reached out
to nine different women?

14:30.036 --> 14:36.407
They reached out to me, and then
I, foolishly, started sending pictures

14:36.409 --> 14:37.809
of myself and things like that.

14:37.811 --> 14:40.511
- You know...
- Wow.

14:40.513 --> 14:45.483
What kinds of pictures
were you sending them, Steven?

14:45.485 --> 14:49.354
Just a selfie of my face. I
was fully clothed. And I have...

14:50.623 --> 14:55.026
I was sticking my tongue out
and I have, kind of, a long tongue.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.830
And I was saying, like, "Wow,
I have a really long tongue.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.798
It's too bad
I don't know how to use it."

15:00.800 --> 15:03.635
- [chuckles]
- [Steven] Um...

15:03.637 --> 15:06.838
Or if they sent me a picture
of, like, themselves nude

15:06.840 --> 15:08.740
I'd be like,
"Wow, you're so hot."

15:08.742 --> 15:10.275
This guy is too much.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.747
Alina, did you know that?

15:15.749 --> 15:19.083
Yeah, because

15:19.085 --> 15:23.388
those girls, they sent me
all the screenshots and...

15:24.556 --> 15:26.958
I've seen everything.

15:29.828 --> 15:34.098
Armando and I facetimed with
them before the show started.

15:34.100 --> 15:39.003
I said, "You're gonna get girls."
I even got boobs sent to me.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.772
But I said, "You're gonna
have that happen to you,

15:40.774 --> 15:42.840
and you need
to ignore it all."

15:42.842 --> 15:47.578
It's my fault for answering,
for encouraging that behavior.

15:47.580 --> 15:51.015
But, also, I feel like I have a
lot of sexual energy, so, like,

15:51.017 --> 15:55.320
there's a lot of repression
going on within myself.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.427
It would be easier if we were able
to find a way where I wouldn't have to

16:02.429 --> 16:06.965
repress these urges
and these feelings as much.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.636
What urges
are you talking about?

16:11.638 --> 16:14.405
[sighs] Oh, my gosh. Okay.

16:16.775 --> 16:21.312
For some reason I really
want to have a threesome.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.182
- And...
- Oh, God.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.588
- Okay, Steven.
- Wow.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.890
[Steven] Okay, and that's something
that... I don't know, I just, like...

16:32.892 --> 16:37.395
I told Alina about this
nearly since the beginning

16:37.397 --> 16:40.331
that it's something
that I wanted to try.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.768
[Alina] I didn't know
how to react.

16:43.770 --> 16:49.140
So I was, like, very lost and
confused, and I don't know...

16:50.376 --> 16:56.247
So, that's something
that I try to suppress.

17:01.553 --> 17:06.157
You know what? Something that, actually,
nobody knows is that I grew up Mormon as well.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.660
I don't think that
it's abnormal to have,

17:09.662 --> 17:11.129
you know,
different sexual desires.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.933
What I find wrong here is throughout,
you know, these past months

17:15.935 --> 17:21.139
we saw Steven trying to show <i>Alina the Book
of Mormon, and just talking about church</i>

17:21.141 --> 17:23.708
- and how to do right.
- Yes.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.445
But he's been doing
the complete opposite.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.848
It's very important to me. I
did grow up in the IDS church.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.385
- You slept with some-- Well, on your...
- [Corey] Okay.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.487
[Corey] But I'm not going
out there and saying, like,

17:36.489 --> 17:39.424
"I am an active member of the
Church," and doing these things

17:39.426 --> 17:42.827
because I'm not following the
standards that the Church has set.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.531
Steven represents himself as
an active member of the Church

17:46.533 --> 17:49.200
and that is what I have
such a big problem with.

17:51.036 --> 17:56.340
One time, Nelson Mandela
was asked if he was a saint

17:56.642 --> 17:58.810
and he said,

17:58.812 --> 18:01.813
"I am only a saint
if you consider a saint

18:01.815 --> 18:03.414
a sinner who keeps on trying."

18:05.784 --> 18:07.385
That is true,
but that's why, Steven,

18:07.387 --> 18:11.889
being part of the IDS faith
does entail certain responsibilities

18:11.891 --> 18:15.126
and you're not living up to
the standards, that's just that.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.965
Okay, let's move on
to another topic.

18:22.568 --> 18:27.472
Just two days before Steven left to
meet up with Alina in Turkey to marry her,

18:27.474 --> 18:34.846
he chose to meet up with his ex-girlfriend.
Vanessa, for some relationship advice.

18:34.848 --> 18:39.383
Let's see how that conversation
went in this never-before-seen clip.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.821
- Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.191
I just kinda wanted to get
some advice from you.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.961
I think something that was
very hard for me

18:50.028 --> 18:51.929
was commitment.

18:51.931 --> 18:56.200
And I don't wanna repeat
my same mistakes.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.803
I think you already have.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.438
You messaged me on Instagram

19:00.440 --> 19:02.573
to tell me that I looked good
in my picture.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.575
- Mmm-hmm.
- I thought that was really inappropriate.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.010
I didn't know you were
in a relationship.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.346
And you wanted to meet
alone with me.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.350
Just for some advice.

19:12.352 --> 19:16.187
- Steven, I'm not your teacher on your path to manhood.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.390
And I would prefer it if this
would be the last time we speak.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.094
[sighs inaudibly]

19:25.764 --> 19:26.898
Keeps getting worse.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.567
Despite not wanting
to see Steven again,

19:29.569 --> 19:32.203
Vanessa has agreed
to come here today

19:32.205 --> 19:36.541
because she has some things
she wants to tell Alina.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.177
Alina, we know that you
and Vanessa have never met.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.813
Are you comfortable meeting
with Vanessa right now?

19:42.881 --> 19:45.816
[sighs and chuckles]

19:45.818 --> 19:49.754
Yeah, I'm comfortable with
meeting Vanessa right now.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.957
All right. Everyone,
please welcome Vanessa.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.227
- Hi, Vanessa.
- Hello.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.630
Thank you so much
for being here.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.599
How comfortable are you

20:01.601 --> 20:03.901
sitting so close
to Steven right now?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.403
Well, I don't feel
that uncomfortable.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.104
It's not like he's dangerous.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.140
I'm here to support Alina.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.641
[Shaun] Okay.

20:10.676 --> 20:14.312
When you first met Steven,
what attracted you to him, initially?

20:15.080 --> 20:17.915
I was going through a bit
of a faith crisis.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.784
I grew up IDS as well.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.053
And...

20:22.055 --> 20:25.923
Along came Steven
and he was really nice.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.858
And how long did you two date?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.427
Only, like,
three or four months.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.063
Okay. Why did
you two break up?

20:32.598 --> 20:36.901
Well, Steven was fronting
as a faithful man

20:36.903 --> 20:38.970
who wanted to be
in a monogamous relationship.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.839
And then he was gonna go
to Russia for two months.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.408
I just told him
he can date other girls,

20:44.410 --> 20:47.411
but please don't go all the way.

20:48.547 --> 20:51.782
So, he comes back from Russia
and I was his girlfriend,

20:51.784 --> 20:55.052
but he confessed to me
that while he was in Russia,

20:55.054 --> 20:58.956
he had had sex with three girls.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.194
Come on.

21:06.131 --> 21:11.035
And, of course, that
broke my heart. I cried...

21:11.637 --> 21:14.705
- Wow.
- Oh, boy.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.742
[Shaun] Vanessa, I'd like
for you to talk directly to Alina.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.877
What do you think she should do?

21:19.879 --> 21:24.382
The things that I'm hearing, how
he has nine girls he's spoken to,

21:24.384 --> 21:27.852
that he wants
to have a threesome.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.988
Why is he trying
to convince her to do this?

21:30.990 --> 21:33.424
Alina, who has never been
with anybody else.

21:33.426 --> 21:38.029
Alina, who is young and
sacrificing so much to be with him.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.631
Like, I know a divorce
is so difficult

21:40.633 --> 21:43.167
and you've made
these vows to him,

21:43.169 --> 21:44.969
but I don't think
he's going to change.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.105
If anything, I would say
he's gotten worse.

21:49.908 --> 21:54.912
I appreciate you being so respectful
to me and caring about my feelings.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.281
I can't just walk away.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.650
Um...

21:59.652 --> 22:06.223
I have a hope that he loves me
enough to be able to change.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.561
He hurt both of you, I don't
think he's gonna change.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.530
I think that Vanessa's right.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.065
Steven, you're not a freak
or anything,

22:14.067 --> 22:18.569
but it's not fair to have
one foot in the door

22:18.571 --> 22:20.171
and one foot out the door.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.241
That's kinda funny
coming from someone

22:24.243 --> 22:26.977
who just abandoned
their husband.

22:26.979 --> 22:30.247
I didn't abandon my husband, I
went to get my son surgery in the US.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.220
I'm fully invested in Alina--

22:36.222 --> 22:38.022
[Ariela] No, you're not.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.024
You're talking to nine different
women, you're not invested in anything.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.759
Um...

22:41.761 --> 22:45.096
It was a fleeting
moment of weakness.

22:45.098 --> 22:47.565
A nine fleeting
moments of weakness?

22:47.567 --> 22:49.400
Well, over a couple of days.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.836
Over how many years? 'Cause
the same thing happened with her.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.771
You just had sex
with three women in Russia?

22:53.773 --> 22:55.606
Please, I can't take
the bull[bleep].

22:55.608 --> 22:57.942
- [laughs]
- [Steven] Alina and I...

22:58.910 --> 23:03.514
Since then have scheduled
a meeting with a psychologist,

23:03.516 --> 23:05.282
because I do need help.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.353
[voice breaking] Alina,
I want you to know

23:09.355 --> 23:13.224
that it's not a bad thing
to leave him.

23:13.226 --> 23:18.863
You're not giving up. This is not what
you agreed to when you moved to Turkey.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.065
You were expecting
a genuine relationship

23:21.067 --> 23:22.833
with a man who was going
to take care of you

23:22.835 --> 23:24.268
and love you and put you first.

23:25.003 --> 23:26.971
And that's not what you've got.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.176
Well, thank you for...

23:32.677 --> 23:35.413
taking care of me, everyone,

23:35.415 --> 23:39.917
but I already decided that I'm
gonna give him another chance

23:39.919 --> 23:42.219
and that's gonna be
the last time.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.988
Thank you, baby.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.297
Steven, Alina, we wish you
guys the very best, we really do.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.267
We'll be right back.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.405
Bye, Alina.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.307
- Bye, everybody.
- [Alina] Bye, thank you so much.

24:04.643 --> 24:07.111
- Can I go to the restroom real quick?
- [woman] Yeah.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.814
<i>[Vanessa] I just feel
terrible for Alina,</i>

24:09.816 --> 24:12.883
that this man is making
her think that these things,

24:12.885 --> 24:15.186
the way he wants to behave
with her is normal

24:15.188 --> 24:18.022
and that she should accept it.

24:18.024 --> 24:22.326
I really, really hope she's willing to
walk away at some point in the future.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.131
Even though I feel terrible,

24:27.133 --> 24:29.834
I think those feelings of
feeling like a terrible person

24:29.836 --> 24:32.803
will hopefully help me
be less terrible.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.672
Yeah. I do mistake,
she did a mistake,

24:34.674 --> 24:35.706
everybody do mistake, you know?

24:35.708 --> 24:37.775
Yeah, but I have
a different opinion.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.710
I agree that you should
learn from your mistake,

24:39.712 --> 24:43.747
but I think that
if you're at the point where

24:43.749 --> 24:47.251
it's already so easy for you to hurt
someone that you supposedly love,

24:47.986 --> 24:51.188
maybe you're not ready
to be in a relationship.

24:51.857 --> 24:55.426
Yeah, it's definitely...
It is difficult.

24:55.428 --> 24:57.061
I mean, if you get to a point
where you realize

24:57.063 --> 24:59.396
that you aren't gonna change
anytime soon...

25:00.131 --> 25:03.267
maybe just let her go.

25:06.638 --> 25:08.072
<i>[Shaun] Coming up...</i>

25:08.074 --> 25:11.141
Dou your parents know
you're married?

25:12.410 --> 25:15.412
Uh, no, my parents don't know
that I'm married.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.581
- Ooh!
- [laughter]

25:17.583 --> 25:21.719
His mom has thrown everything
at the relationship to break it up

25:21.721 --> 25:23.220
and after ten years,
it has not done that.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.155
He's even gotten married.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.224
[mouthing]

25:29.427 --> 25:30.728
<i>[Shaun] And later...</i>

25:30.730 --> 25:32.129
I've been here seven years

25:32.131 --> 25:34.965
and not one person from
the family has visited me.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.734
- That's really hard.
- [exhales loudly]

25:36.736 --> 25:38.068
That's a long time.

25:40.839 --> 25:42.973
To say that I don't
love my brother,

25:42.975 --> 25:44.408
that's not your place, okay?

25:45.810 --> 25:46.777
[man] Everyone's ready.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.511
We're going to camera four,

25:47.513 --> 25:51.982
in five, four, three...

25:53.718 --> 25:57.755
Welcome back to <i>90 Day Fiance:
The Other Way The Couples Tell All.</i>

25:57.757 --> 26:00.591
Now I wanna move on
to Jenny and Sumit,

26:00.593 --> 26:04.028
who have been through so much
to fight for their love.

26:04.030 --> 26:08.065
Jenny, how does it feel to
finally be married to Sumit?

26:08.600 --> 26:11.802
I feel like I can
finally breathe.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.238
We stood by each other's side,
we didn't give up.

26:14.539 --> 26:15.672
And we made it.

26:15.807 --> 26:20.578
And now nobody can stop us,
nobody can break us apart

26:20.580 --> 26:21.946
and we will be together forever.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.647
And they can't throw me
out of India, either.

26:23.649 --> 26:26.951
[all laugh]

26:26.953 --> 26:29.620
I think you guys deserve
a round of applause.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.021
- Don't you all think?
- Yes.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.925
'Cause it has been quite
a road, quite a journey.

26:34.927 --> 26:35.993
Thank you.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.762
- Sumit.
- Yeah?

26:38.764 --> 26:42.166
Do your parents know
you're married?

26:45.971 --> 26:48.973
No, my parents don't know
that I'm married.

26:48.975 --> 26:49.773
Ooh!

26:49.775 --> 26:51.609
Oh...

26:51.611 --> 26:55.646
We were so afraid that if
he went ahead and told them,

26:55.648 --> 26:57.081
they would have came
and stopped it

26:57.083 --> 26:59.016
and we wouldn't
be married right now.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.619
- Yeah.
- Yes.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.588
I've been thinking that maybe
I'm gonna tell them today.

27:04.590 --> 27:07.157
- [Ellie] Today?
- Oh, my God.

27:08.693 --> 27:11.161
- It's scaring me a lot--
- It scares us both a lot.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.930
- [chuckles] Right.
- Yeah.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.531
- True.
- [Shaun] Well, Sumit,

27:14.533 --> 27:17.635
right now we have your parents

27:17.637 --> 27:21.639
standing by about to join in
the conversation.

27:21.641 --> 27:25.142
- They have not heard this part of the discussion.
- Uh-oh.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.312
We are all here for your support

27:29.614 --> 27:31.248
when you tell them.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.585
Parents are gonna be
disappointed, for sure,

27:34.587 --> 27:36.687
but at the end
they will understand.

27:36.689 --> 27:40.157
It's your happiness
and it's the person you love,

27:40.159 --> 27:42.459
- and I know that will come forward.
- Yes!

27:42.461 --> 27:46.930
Now I'd like to say hello
to Sadhna and Anil.

27:46.932 --> 27:50.300
- Hello.
- Thank you so much for joining us today. How are you?

27:50.302 --> 27:52.102
Fine.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.873
I'd also like to bring in Sumit's
brother and sister-in-law.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.208
This is Amit and Shree.
Hi, there.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.611
- Hello.
- Hi from us.

28:00.613 --> 28:04.715
After years of back-and-forth about
Jenny being accepted into the family,

28:04.717 --> 28:10.020
Sumit's family astrologer was
finally able to make some headway.

28:10.022 --> 28:15.959
Let's watch the moment where Jenny gained
some hope about her and Sumit's future.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.200
[speaking Hindi]

28:43.822 --> 28:45.723
[Anil speaking]

28:45.725 --> 28:47.124
[speaking Hindi]

28:47.126 --> 28:49.226
- Ooh!
- [Jenny sobbing]

28:50.095 --> 28:52.963
[Anil speaking Hindi]

29:05.410 --> 29:08.612
[Shaun] Hmm. Okay.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.447
Let me go to Jenny first.

29:10.449 --> 29:16.487
Jenny, what was it like seeing
what Sumit's parents said

29:16.489 --> 29:21.925
after they made this big deal
about accepting you into the family

29:21.927 --> 29:25.729
and just stepping aside and not
interfering with your relationship?

29:25.731 --> 29:27.798
[Jenny] First of all,
that's wrong.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.433
I was so happy that day.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.802
I just felt like everything
was going to be fine.

29:31.804 --> 29:37.207
And then all it took was two or three
months to pass and everything was forgotten.

29:37.209 --> 29:41.245
That's not fair. It's not
right for her to do that to me.

29:42.881 --> 29:43.947
[Sumit speaking]

29:53.858 --> 29:55.692
Oh.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.229
That didn't last long.
Those words didn't last long.

29:59.231 --> 30:04.768
Sadhna, the astrologer said
to get out of the way,

30:04.770 --> 30:06.870
let them be happy.

30:06.872 --> 30:11.842
Aren't you going against what
the astrologer told you to do?

30:11.844 --> 30:14.411
[speaking Hindi]

30:20.585 --> 30:22.386
Amit, what does she say?

30:31.963 --> 30:37.401
[Shaun] But, Sadhna,
do you feel that it is okay

30:37.403 --> 30:40.404
if Sumit and Jenny get married?

30:40.939 --> 30:45.209
[speaking Hindi]

30:46.845 --> 30:51.048
She's saying that
she won't accept it.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.487
[Shaun] So, Amit,
do you see anything wrong

30:57.489 --> 31:00.858
with Jenny and your brother
getting married?

31:00.860 --> 31:04.995
In perspective of love,
there is nothing wrong there,

31:04.997 --> 31:11.034
but considering family,
parents, it is wrong.

31:14.739 --> 31:17.307
This is crazy.
People are crazy.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.676
His mom and dad,
and especially his mom

31:19.678 --> 31:23.080
has thrown everything at
the relationship to break it up,

31:23.082 --> 31:26.250
and after ten years it has not done
that. He's even gotten married...

31:26.417 --> 31:27.384
[mouthing]

31:27.386 --> 31:29.786
To someone else,

31:29.788 --> 31:35.025
and it almost gets to
the point of cruelty to them.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.405
I disagree.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.075
Ten years has been a long time.

31:52.877 --> 31:56.647
You've given them ten years
of trying to stop it.

31:56.649 --> 31:59.516
That's the definition of cruel.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.754
Sadhna and Anil, what
would happen if they just said,

32:03.756 --> 32:06.790
"Okay. It's too bad
we don't have your blessing.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.192
We're just going to
get married anyway"?

32:28.279 --> 32:31.481
'Cause we love each other.
That's why. Because.

32:31.483 --> 32:35.552
Why does anybody get married that
loves each other? Because they want to.

32:35.554 --> 32:39.790
If Sumit's brother, if they told
him he couldn't marry her...

32:39.792 --> 32:43.727
I think he wants to marry her. How would he
feel if someone told him, "No, you can't"?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.762
See, it depends.

32:45.764 --> 32:51.335
Uh... Would you
not have married her?

32:55.673 --> 32:58.408
- No, I would not have.
- [Kenny] Oh, boy.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.411
- How does she feel about that?
- [chuckles]

33:01.413 --> 33:04.514
I think he's saying
what he thinks he has to say.

33:04.516 --> 33:08.785
Uh... I don't know
how to react,

33:08.787 --> 33:12.556
because this question
has never, ever...

33:12.558 --> 33:16.026
you know, came across
to my mind.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.428
That's why you put yourself
in someone else's shoes.

33:18.430 --> 33:22.065
Yeah, nobody should have
to deal with that question.

33:23.935 --> 33:29.072
Okay, Sumit, is there anything
that you'd like to say to your parents?

33:57.568 --> 33:59.236
[Shaun] Okay. Um...

33:59.238 --> 34:04.307
Is there anything else you
want to say to your parents?

34:17.989 --> 34:24.327
Okay, Sumit, is there anything
else you want to say to your parents?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.071
Nothing else
you guys want to say?

34:44.315 --> 34:49.719
All right. Well... I was hoping we'd
get some kind of resolution here,

34:49.721 --> 34:53.790
but it doesn't seem like we're
going to get that today, so...

34:53.792 --> 34:59.863
Sadhna, Anil, Amit and Shree,
thank you very much for joining us.

34:59.865 --> 35:02.866
- We appreciate you being here.
- [both] Thank you so much.

35:02.868 --> 35:03.834
Thank you so much.

35:03.836 --> 35:06.103
It's like beating a dead horse.

35:06.105 --> 35:10.407
Uh, Jenny, just so you know,
Sumit's parents are still on

35:10.409 --> 35:13.777
- and they can still hear our audio.
- That's okay.

35:13.779 --> 35:14.544
[others laughing]

35:14.546 --> 35:17.948
- [whispering]
- [both chuckle]

35:17.950 --> 35:22.219
- Okay, now we're clear.
- Jenny, you did a really good job.

35:22.221 --> 35:27.290
I don't have that kind of
patience. I would just blow up.

35:28.926 --> 35:31.661
Sumit, you're on a timeline
now, buddy.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.831
They're going to find out
that you're married.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.834
And that everyone knew in here
and you didn't tell--

35:37.836 --> 35:40.203
- [Shaun] And that everyone knew.
- Right?

35:40.205 --> 35:42.973
Your mama's
going to be mad, Sumit.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.076
[Sumit speaking]

35:49.981 --> 35:51.548
[Ellie] Mmm-hmm.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.549
- It's the right decision.
- Yeah.

35:52.551 --> 35:55.051
It has to be face to face.
I agree with that.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.723
I suggest you call, tell them,
and hang up the phone. Okay?

35:59.725 --> 36:01.191
[laughing]

36:03.194 --> 36:07.264
I do hope this ends
favorably for you...

36:07.266 --> 36:09.833
- Thank you.
- In whatever way that could be.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.335
I wish you the best. Don't
forget, tell us what happened.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.971
Record it. [chuckles]

36:15.907 --> 36:20.577
I want to change gears now and
move over to Kenny and Armando.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.013
Still newlyweds. Are you
in that honeymoon stage?

36:23.015 --> 36:26.016
- Oh, yeah. We've been there a long
time. [laughs] - [Shaun] A long time?

36:27.952 --> 36:28.752
How is little Hannah doing?

36:28.754 --> 36:30.654
She's great. She's here.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.122
- Say hi.
- [Shaun] Let's see little Hannah.

36:32.124 --> 36:33.890
- Oh, look!
- [others] Aw!

36:33.892 --> 36:36.193
- She got a little haircut.
- [Armando] She did.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.828
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- So cute.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.698
- [Kenny] Miss you. Love you.
- [Shaun] Very sweet. Okay, bye, Hannah.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.401
- Okay, bye-bye.
- [Shaun] All right. Lovely. Beautiful.

36:44.403 --> 36:48.505
So, let's tell everybody why
you are back in the United States.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.508
You're here for something
very special, right?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.811
My daughter, Cassidy,
is due to have a baby any day.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.981
- Wow. Congratulations.
- So my second grandchild.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.784
He's the youngest
grandpa around.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.118
[laughter]

37:02.120 --> 37:06.690
Does Cassidy giving birth make
you want to stay in the States?

37:06.692 --> 37:09.426
That's an issue for me.

37:09.428 --> 37:13.296
I feel like
I'm constantly conflicted,

37:13.298 --> 37:19.402
because I want to be with them and I
know I'm missing out on a lot of things.

37:19.404 --> 37:23.707
And I have a new family, too,
that I'm trying to blend together.

37:23.709 --> 37:28.612
[sniffles] In some ways
I am a little concerned

37:28.614 --> 37:32.515
that him spending
the next weeks at home

37:32.517 --> 37:35.452
and, you know,
welcoming Cassidy's new baby,

37:35.454 --> 37:38.221
is he going to feel
more of that need to stay?

37:39.423 --> 37:42.659
Kenny, I can see you getting
emotional about this already.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.961
I'm terrible. [sobs]

37:47.098 --> 37:51.167
- [sobbing]
- [all murmur sympathetically]

37:54.605 --> 37:56.673
- [Kenny sniffles]
- Aw.

37:56.675 --> 38:00.310
You know, he's not wrong
in a lot of ways, that...

38:01.979 --> 38:05.982
But I know I would never
stay here, because...

38:06.584 --> 38:10.086
he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

38:16.027 --> 38:22.065
Now may be a good time to bring these
two extended families together today.

38:22.067 --> 38:25.402
Please welcome Kenny's children

38:25.404 --> 38:29.639
Taylor, Madison,
Cassidy, and Bricen...

38:29.641 --> 38:31.608
- [woman 1] Hi!
- [woman 2] Hello!

38:31.610 --> 38:36.046
And Armando's sister Debbie
and mother Virginia.

38:36.048 --> 38:39.582
<i>- [Kenny] Hola.
- [both] Hola. [both chuckle]</i>

38:39.584 --> 38:42.819
[Shaun]
Oh, my goodness, Cassidy.

38:42.821 --> 38:47.090
- Any day now. Oh, my gosh.
- It's eviction-notice time.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.893
- [all laugh]
- [Shaun] Debbie and Virginia,

38:49.895 --> 38:52.562
how does it feel
seeing the whole family now?

38:52.564 --> 38:55.699
Well, it looks beautiful.
[laughs]

38:55.701 --> 38:58.134
We wish you guys
all could be with us.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.271
What is it like seeing him?

39:01.273 --> 39:05.575
Miss him a lot. Yeah.

39:05.577 --> 39:11.948
It's nice that this blended family
is getting along very, very well.

39:11.950 --> 39:16.686
- At first it was a little rocky, right?
- Yeah.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.355
- [Shaun] Does everybody agree?
- Yes.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.891
Coming to terms with
Armando's sexuality

39:21.893 --> 39:25.562
had been hard for many people
in his family, especially his father.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.832
However,
when the wedding day came,

39:28.834 --> 39:33.236
he had their support, which
meant the world to him. Let's watch.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.007
[speaking Spanish]

39:38.009 --> 39:39.275
Oh...

39:42.012 --> 39:45.181
[Armando Sr. speaking Spanish]

40:07.772 --> 40:11.107
- [Shaun] Wow.
- Crying, baby?

40:11.742 --> 40:13.476
[speaking Spanish]

40:13.478 --> 40:15.845
[Debbie] Yeah, she says
everything was very beautiful.

40:15.847 --> 40:22.218
Armando, that's your
first time seeing that, right?

40:26.323 --> 40:32.028
Seeing him that supportive,
that open, it's...

40:32.897 --> 40:36.199
[voice breaking] what I've
longed for. It's what I've fought for.

40:40.204 --> 40:44.441
Just shows that... It took time,
but progression happened...

40:44.443 --> 40:48.411
And just...

40:48.413 --> 40:52.182
being who I am now and
being celebrated is a blessing.

40:52.184 --> 40:59.088
Sumit, you got really emotional
when you were looking at that.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.433
Yeah.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.104
[Shaun] Kind of tough.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.307
[Sumit] Mmm-hmm.

41:17.309 --> 41:18.941
[Shaun] Wow. Okay.

41:18.943 --> 41:23.179
While Kenny and Armando were totally
on the same page about getting married,

41:23.181 --> 41:27.016
there was another issue
they didn't meet eye to eye on.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.885
Let's take a look.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.888
I've been thinking of adoption,

41:31.890 --> 41:35.091
but the more I think about it,

41:35.093 --> 41:38.161
I kinda like the idea of a baby.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.830
Baby?

41:40.865 --> 41:41.831
[chuckles]

41:41.833 --> 41:44.133
Like, in vitro or something.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.504
[Kenny] Oh, you'd want
to go that route?

41:47.506 --> 41:50.373
Whew! [chuckles]

41:52.743 --> 41:54.777
Debbie and Virginia,
I'm going to start with you.

41:54.779 --> 41:59.215
Did you know that they wanted
to have another child?

41:59.217 --> 42:04.787
No. [laughs]
No, we didn't, but...

42:04.789 --> 42:06.523
I feel happy.

42:06.525 --> 42:10.126
[speaking Spanish]

42:16.667 --> 42:21.938
I know why my mom, she's more,
like, into having a baby of our own,

42:21.940 --> 42:24.641
because, to be honest,
in Mexico, in our culture,

42:24.643 --> 42:28.044
adopting isn't big.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.414
It's more like you have your
own kids, your blood children.

42:31.416 --> 42:34.817
I think I share that same
thought with my mom.

42:34.819 --> 42:38.755
Kenny, your children
feel differently.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.757
Somewhat.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.459
[Cassidy] I feel like
we agree more with adoption.

42:43.461 --> 42:46.763
Like, I don't want to sound selfish
or anything, but I'd feel kind of weird

42:46.765 --> 42:53.036
if they were to have a baby and their
grand-baby is older than their baby.

42:53.038 --> 42:58.975
It's just, kind of... I don't
like the thought of it.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.345
[Armando] It's hard,
because they've been, like,

43:02.347 --> 43:05.315
the only ones supportive of us
through and through.

43:05.317 --> 43:09.419
This is sort of, like, I guess, the first
time that they're not fully on board.

43:10.454 --> 43:14.991
I don't think we're opposed to
you guys, like, having another child.

43:14.993 --> 43:18.761
I just think we're kind of opposed
to you guys having, like, a baby,

43:18.763 --> 43:21.831
'cause that's starting over
for you.

43:21.833 --> 43:24.901
We're so far away.
We're so much older.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.804
We have our own lives.
And then you are...

43:27.806 --> 43:29.906
almost 60,

43:29.908 --> 43:32.909
and you'll be so consumed
with your new baby.

43:32.911 --> 43:34.377
[voice breaking]
Like, it's just a lot.

43:35.679 --> 43:38.081
So, I think
we would be comfortable

43:38.083 --> 43:42.285
having not such
a small, young kid.

43:42.287 --> 43:45.955
It's not about our comfort.
It's about their happiness.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.825
I'm happy if they want to have
a kid that's biologically theirs

43:48.827 --> 43:52.261
or if they want to adopt,
I'm all for supporting that.

43:57.067 --> 43:58.101
[Kenny sobs]

44:00.037 --> 44:02.138
[Evelin speaking]

44:04.708 --> 44:07.243
[others chuckling]

44:08.579 --> 44:12.915
I want to thank all of you
for joining us today,

44:12.917 --> 44:16.853
and, of course, we wish you
guys the very best in your marriage.

44:16.855 --> 44:18.855
Thank you.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.423
And we'll be right back.

44:23.894 --> 44:28.398
Mimi and Wish, how do you feel
about Ari and Bini's relationship?

44:28.400 --> 44:30.133
[Wish speaking Amharic]

44:32.803 --> 44:35.171
You never wanted
this relationship to work out.

44:37.408 --> 44:40.009
You guys are pathetic.

44:41.478 --> 44:42.545
[man 1] We're rolling?

44:42.612 --> 44:44.647
- [man 2] Yes, sir.
- [man 1] Rolling. Everyone's ready?

44:44.649 --> 44:48.651
Welcome back, everybody. I
want to move over to Ari and Bini.

44:48.653 --> 44:50.953
Let's talk about
little baby Avi.

44:50.955 --> 44:53.823
- How's he doing?
- [Ariela] He's doing great.

44:53.825 --> 44:55.024
He's just every day
more wonderful.

44:55.026 --> 44:57.860
He is very strong,

44:57.862 --> 44:59.796
I think, maybe, just like Daddy.

44:59.798 --> 45:02.231
- It's just genetic.
- [all laugh]

45:03.667 --> 45:07.603
So, you guys have been through
some serious ups and downs.

45:07.605 --> 45:10.139
How is the relationship today?

45:10.141 --> 45:14.210
Today the relationship,
like... it's good.

45:14.212 --> 45:16.579
I think it's, like,
anxiety, before.

45:16.581 --> 45:22.418
Yeah. I think Biniyam having
the opportunity to be in the US

45:22.420 --> 45:25.988
and see where I'm from,
understand me better,

45:25.990 --> 45:28.758
I don't know, I think it makes the
relationship stronger by showing, like,

45:28.760 --> 45:33.396
"Okay, we don't need things from
each other. We just want each other."

45:33.398 --> 45:36.032
While Ari and Bini continue
to work on their relationship,

45:36.034 --> 45:39.736
Ari seems to have figured
it out with her ex-husband,

45:39.738 --> 45:42.138
with whom
she is still very close.

45:42.140 --> 45:47.009
Coming to join us in the
studio is Ari's ex, Leandro.

45:47.011 --> 45:49.212
- Hi, Leandro.
- Hi.

45:49.214 --> 45:52.715
- How are you doing?
- Uh... good.

45:52.717 --> 45:53.883
[Shaun] Good.

45:53.885 --> 45:56.686
- Hey, Andro.
- Hey, Ari.

45:56.688 --> 45:59.288
- Bini.
- What's up? How are you?

45:59.290 --> 46:03.893
When Leandro traveled to Africa
to see Ari and her new family,

46:03.895 --> 46:09.465
it became clear to everyone that
they had left a few things unresolved.

46:09.467 --> 46:13.169
Let's see
how his visit unfolded.

46:23.847 --> 46:27.350
I really needed bras, because you
know I can't find it here in Ethiopia.

46:32.055 --> 46:35.391
We never actually broke up.
I just never came home.

46:40.764 --> 46:45.935
I didn't want to lose you.
I was very confused.

46:50.607 --> 46:53.576
[Shaun] Ari, you got
really emotional, so...

46:53.578 --> 47:00.016
When you met Bini you were
still married to Leandro, right?

47:00.018 --> 47:02.652
- I met Bini... Yes, I was still married.
- Okay, you were still married.

47:02.654 --> 47:08.925
And so you had to call
and tell your husband

47:08.927 --> 47:12.361
that you were pregnant
with another man's baby.

47:14.898 --> 47:17.099
- Yeah.
- [Shaun] Yeah.

47:17.101 --> 47:18.568
What do you remember
about that conversation?

47:18.570 --> 47:21.204
[Ariela] I remember it
very well.

47:21.206 --> 47:25.408
I was crying, and I told you, you
know, "I'm pregnant. I'm really scared."

47:25.410 --> 47:28.578
You are the person
that I would call

47:28.580 --> 47:30.713
in a situation where
I'm not sure what to do,

47:30.715 --> 47:33.516
so I'm calling you
to ask your advice,

47:33.518 --> 47:36.619
but also I don't want to hurt
you at the same time, so...

47:36.621 --> 47:39.155
It was a very difficult moment
for me.

47:39.157 --> 47:42.124
Bini, did you know
she was making that call?

47:43.560 --> 47:45.127
No.

47:45.829 --> 47:49.866
That's why I'm so
worried about my situation.

47:49.868 --> 47:53.970
I feel like just still, Ari,
she love him so much.

47:53.972 --> 47:56.005
They talking, like,
on the phone,

47:56.007 --> 47:58.107
like, maybe two hours,
like, in Spanish.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.709
I don't understand Spanish.

47:59.711 --> 48:02.144
- Like...
- [laughter]

48:02.146 --> 48:06.048
If they're talking, like, clearly
she should advise something.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.884
You need to start
to speak Spanish, bro.

48:07.886 --> 48:10.620
- [Biniyam] Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
- [others chuckle]

48:10.622 --> 48:12.355
- I'll teach you some Spanish.
- I'm saying...

48:12.357 --> 48:16.993
If I was a girl,
best friends with Ari,

48:16.995 --> 48:21.597
and talk four hours with her and giving
her advice, even speaking in Spanish,

48:21.599 --> 48:22.899
would that bother you?

48:22.901 --> 48:26.402
No. Because bothering me
is you're Ari's ex-husband.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.970
Yeah, 'cause that's the reality.

48:27.972 --> 48:28.738
[Shaun] That's a big difference.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.973
There's no comparison.

48:31.508 --> 48:32.808
- [laughs] - [Victor]
There's no comparison.

48:32.810 --> 48:35.511
Like, if I was in his place,
hearing him give you advice,

48:35.513 --> 48:39.015
and he's your ex of a long
time, that's hard to swallow.

48:39.017 --> 48:43.119
I also do give Leandro advice
with his own relationships.

48:43.121 --> 48:45.588
I bet. And I don't know if
his girlfriend's into it either.

48:45.590 --> 48:49.125
- But I know it wouldn't work on this end.
- [all chuckling]

48:50.761 --> 48:52.895
[Ellie] Yeah, you shouldn't talk
about your current relationship,

48:52.897 --> 48:54.430
- I think...
- No.

48:54.432 --> 48:55.631
With anybody but him.

48:55.633 --> 48:59.101
Because it's hurtful
to the person you're with.

48:59.103 --> 49:02.371
Which is kind of, like,
stepping over the line.

49:03.206 --> 49:05.308
Do you realize, though, Leandro,

49:05.310 --> 49:09.178
that you are causing problems
in their relationship?

49:11.048 --> 49:13.816
Probably not, because he
hears it from Ari and not from Bini.

49:13.818 --> 49:15.885
Exactly.

49:15.887 --> 49:18.521
But I think that has to do
more with his insecurities

49:18.523 --> 49:20.690
than with the relationship
itself.

49:20.692 --> 49:25.828
How would you feel if you were
sitting where Bini's sitting right now?

49:25.830 --> 49:26.595
That's what I'm thinking now...

49:26.597 --> 49:27.496
Oh, no.

49:29.666 --> 49:31.968
Oh, I completely understand
his jealousy

49:31.970 --> 49:33.703
and the threatening situation.

49:33.705 --> 49:35.805
Do you think he should back off?

49:35.807 --> 49:38.207
- Oh, definitely, yeah. Of course.
- [laughs]

49:38.209 --> 49:40.076
What do you say to that?

49:40.078 --> 49:41.777
[Leandro] Well...

49:41.779 --> 49:45.548
I'm very good friends with Ari,

49:45.550 --> 49:48.718
so if she tells me, "Back off"
then...

49:48.720 --> 49:50.553
What about if I tell you,
"Back off."

49:50.555 --> 49:52.755
Well, she has to tell me.

49:52.757 --> 49:58.227
She's her own individual and
she needs to make that decision.

50:00.130 --> 50:05.935
Who thinks Leandro should
just back off from this friendship?

50:05.937 --> 50:07.036
[laughter]

50:07.038 --> 50:08.004
I think so.

50:09.139 --> 50:10.406
Okay.

50:10.408 --> 50:13.242
Well, hopefully everyone
can get on the same page

50:13.244 --> 50:15.978
about this dynamic
at some point.

50:16.913 --> 50:18.647
Leandro,
thank you for being here.

50:18.649 --> 50:21.517
And I wish you the best of luck.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.219
- [Leandro] Thank you.
- [Shaun] Bye-bye.

50:26.823 --> 50:29.658
Leandro wasn't the only person
interjecting themselves

50:29.660 --> 50:31.594
in Ari and Bini's relationship.

50:31.596 --> 50:33.696
Biniyam's sisters,
Wish and Mimi,

50:33.698 --> 50:36.866
were a source of contention
for the couple, as well.

50:36.868 --> 50:39.902
I want to check in with them
from Ethiopia.

50:39.904 --> 50:42.438
Please welcome Mimi and Wish.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.173
Hi, ladies.

50:46.009 --> 50:49.111
How have you guys been doing
with them so far away?

50:50.614 --> 50:51.580
[Mimi] Mmm-hmm.

50:51.582 --> 50:54.617
[Shaun] Well, Ari promised
that she and Avi

50:54.619 --> 50:57.720
would return to Ethiopia
after their baby's surgery.

50:57.722 --> 51:00.556
But once she got wind
that Bini was partying

51:00.558 --> 51:01.991
and possibly cheating,

51:01.993 --> 51:05.594
Ari gave Bini an ultimatum
he did not see coming.

51:05.596 --> 51:06.929
Let's watch.

51:06.931 --> 51:08.898
I'm not coming back to Ethiopia.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.966
[deep sigh]

51:11.001 --> 51:12.635
Wish is the one who told me

51:12.637 --> 51:14.904
that you had other women
in my house

51:14.906 --> 51:16.906
and that you've been around
with other girls.

51:16.908 --> 51:18.207
Do you think
you're being sneaky?

51:21.645 --> 51:22.878
God knows who you [bleep]

51:22.880 --> 51:25.014
and God knows
what you've been doing

51:25.016 --> 51:27.316
and I don't even care
and I don't even want to know.

51:30.954 --> 51:31.887
Wow.

51:31.889 --> 51:34.156
Yeah, it's very hard
to watch that scene.

51:35.492 --> 51:37.726
I thought he was cheating on
me because of so many reasons.

51:37.728 --> 51:41.897
He didn't pick up the phone, he
wouldn't answer my texts back.

51:41.899 --> 51:44.400
She knows that I have
a problem, I have anxiety.

51:44.402 --> 51:47.203
And when she left,

51:47.205 --> 51:50.606
I don't want to think about, "Ari, she
comes back, she doesn't come back,"

51:50.608 --> 51:51.907
Just very stressful.

51:51.909 --> 51:55.644
We're fighting a lot. It's better
if I don't answer the phone.

51:55.646 --> 51:59.982
I love you, I understand you were
suffering, but I was suffering too.

52:00.617 --> 52:03.819
Ari, you said that Wish,
Bini's sister,

52:03.821 --> 52:06.489
told you he was cheating on you.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.824
She asked me, "Can I sleep
over at the house?"

52:08.826 --> 52:10.459
Then, because she was mad,
she thought didn't want her there.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.829
So then she said,
"Why do you care?

52:13.831 --> 52:16.098
There are so many other girls
sleeping there are the house anyways."

52:16.100 --> 52:17.266
[Wish speaking]

52:24.541 --> 52:27.176
Okay. Do you believe
what Wish is saying?

52:27.178 --> 52:29.812
There was so much
to unpack there, but no.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.981
[wish speaking]

52:33.783 --> 52:36.252
[scoffs] No.
That's ridiculous.

52:37.454 --> 52:41.624
But do you think
that Bini has cheated on you?

52:41.626 --> 52:45.161
[Ariela] Do I think that he was
hanging around with other girls

52:45.163 --> 52:46.061
and that there girls
in my house and stuff?

52:46.063 --> 52:46.896
Yeah.

52:46.898 --> 52:49.265
Do I think that he slept
with someone?

52:51.902 --> 52:54.436
I mean, I don't know.
But I don't think so.

52:54.438 --> 52:56.405
Mimi and Wish,

52:56.407 --> 52:59.742
how do you feel about Ari
and Bini's relationship today.

52:59.744 --> 53:02.978
[speak Amharic]

53:13.590 --> 53:16.025
Avi's nanny, a very close
and dear friend of mine,

53:16.027 --> 53:19.328
was not giving me bad advice
about Biniyam.

53:19.330 --> 53:21.030
Actually, the only reason...

53:21.032 --> 53:22.631
I would say one of the only reasons
that me and him are still together

53:22.633 --> 53:24.400
is 'cause she told me,

53:24.402 --> 53:26.936
"Stick it out. He loves you and
you love him. Stay together."

53:26.938 --> 53:31.207
- This is your nanny?
- Yeah, she's Avi's nanny.

53:31.975 --> 53:33.976
[Ariela] Now you're
my best friend.

53:33.978 --> 53:36.178
- You're like my family.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:38.415 --> 53:40.349
I wish you would be happy,
you know?

53:44.020 --> 53:46.388
[speaking Amharic]

53:48.825 --> 53:51.260
[Mimi speaking Amharic]

53:51.262 --> 53:53.329
Bini loves her very much.

53:53.597 --> 53:54.630
[laughs]

53:54.664 --> 53:55.998
[Ariela] Yeah, he does.
Why don't you tell them?

53:56.000 --> 53:56.966
That you care for her very much.

53:56.968 --> 53:58.167
She's family to you.

53:59.536 --> 54:00.969
[Ariela] I'm not forcing him.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.806
But you just told me that I involve
other people in our relationship.

54:03.808 --> 54:05.107
Why don't you guys--

54:05.976 --> 54:08.177
Stop involving yourselves
in our relationship.

54:08.179 --> 54:09.378
You guys are jealous--

54:11.414 --> 54:14.083
No. You guys are jealous of
him and you're jealous of me.

54:14.085 --> 54:15.851
You will always try
to poison my mind

54:15.853 --> 54:17.152
against your brother.

54:17.154 --> 54:20.222
You never wanted
this relationship to work out.

54:20.724 --> 54:22.424
I never, ever, ever

54:22.426 --> 54:24.827
want to speak
to either of you again.

54:24.829 --> 54:25.995
You guys are pathetic.

54:25.997 --> 54:27.196
[Wish speaking]

54:27.198 --> 54:27.863
[Ariela] You are not my family.

54:27.865 --> 54:29.798
I do not want you in my life.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.400
- They're just jealous.
- [Wish speaking Amharic]

54:31.402 --> 54:33.435
They'll just never change.

54:35.238 --> 54:36.372
[Wish speaks Amharic]

54:38.141 --> 54:40.209
[speaking Amharic]

54:41.044 --> 54:41.777
[Wish] Jealous...

54:41.779 --> 54:44.113
[speaking Amharic]

54:55.992 --> 54:58.260
Bini, what was
your sister saying?

55:08.905 --> 55:09.972
[Wish speaking]

55:10.807 --> 55:12.374
Yeah.

55:15.945 --> 55:18.847
Do you think Ari tells too much
of your business to people?

55:18.849 --> 55:19.948
[Biniyam speaking]

55:21.751 --> 55:22.351
[Shaun] Uh-huh.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.029
[Shaun] Okay.

55:36.099 --> 55:37.132
[exhales deeply]

55:38.268 --> 55:39.768
That woman, Wish,

55:39.770 --> 55:42.571
she's the only person telling me
negative things about her brother.

55:42.573 --> 55:45.207
Even telling me, "There's
women staying in your house."

55:45.209 --> 55:47.810
Who can believe her? She wants
to destroy this relationship.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.011
"The nanny."

55:49.013 --> 55:51.113
She's an amazing human being.

55:51.115 --> 55:51.980
Much better
than they'll ever be.

55:51.982 --> 55:53.982
It's disgusting.

55:54.784 --> 55:56.719
So, whose fault do you think
it is?

55:56.721 --> 55:58.520
Is it Ari's fault?
Or is it Mimi and Wish's fault

55:58.522 --> 56:00.389
that there is so much conflict?

56:00.391 --> 56:02.558
They're girls. Like,
this is a girls' problem.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.293
That's the situation for me.

56:06.796 --> 56:08.864
I know it's my problem
but it's the girls.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.299
So many times they're fighting.

56:10.301 --> 56:11.266
Then so many times
they go together.

56:11.268 --> 56:13.669
Because they're family members.

56:13.671 --> 56:16.405
Ariela just said she doesn't
want them to be part of the family

56:18.408 --> 56:19.808
You think she's gonna calm down?

56:54.677 --> 56:57.279
Yeah, I'm gonna go back in,
but I don't wanna talk to them.

56:59.716 --> 57:01.150
I don't even want to see them.

57:04.154 --> 57:07.923
[Shaun] Wow. Whew!
Welcome back.

57:07.925 --> 57:08.857
How are you doing?

57:08.859 --> 57:09.625
I'm okay.

57:09.627 --> 57:11.026
What happened?

57:11.028 --> 57:14.196
Well, I'll tell you about it
when they're gone.

57:14.198 --> 57:15.264
Ooh.

57:16.566 --> 57:17.733
Bini?

57:17.735 --> 57:20.102
You said Ari's gonna calm
down. She's still mad.

57:20.104 --> 57:22.604
- [laughter] - [Ariela]
It's not that I'm mad.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.873
It's just I don't see any reason to
get into a conversation with them

57:24.875 --> 57:26.742
because they're not
being honest.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.644
There's nothing to be gained

57:28.646 --> 57:30.646
by talking with them.

57:30.648 --> 57:32.848
I've tried so many times to
build a relationship with them,

57:32.850 --> 57:34.016
to be friendly with them,
to help them,

57:34.018 --> 57:35.384
to be family with them,

57:35.386 --> 57:36.785
and it's never worked.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.987
So I just get to the point,
I'm done. Like, that's it.

57:38.989 --> 57:39.988
I don't have anything to say.

57:39.990 --> 57:42.424
[speaking Amharic]

57:42.426 --> 57:44.092
I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.428
I'm not interested
in talking with them,

57:46.430 --> 57:47.963
so if they're gonna
continue here

57:47.965 --> 57:50.098
then I'm gonna just get up
and walk away until they're gone.

57:51.868 --> 57:52.868
[Ariela] Okay. All right.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.169
Okay.

57:54.171 --> 57:57.773
It's obvious that there's still
a lot of unresolved issues,

57:57.775 --> 58:00.409
so Mimi, Wish,

58:00.411 --> 58:03.412
I appreciate you ladies
coming on today.

58:03.414 --> 58:05.180
We will talk to you later.

58:05.182 --> 58:06.415
But thank you so much.

58:06.417 --> 58:09.051
- [both] Thank you.
- [Shaun] Okay.

58:12.021 --> 58:13.822
[softly] It didn't end
very happy.

58:13.824 --> 58:19.862
Oof! What was that about?

58:19.864 --> 58:21.630
I think it took us all
by surprise.

58:21.632 --> 58:23.265
The nanny, she...

58:23.267 --> 58:26.969
has lived with us
since Avi was born.

58:26.971 --> 58:30.539
She's seen everything going on in
the relationship between Biniyam and I.

58:30.541 --> 58:31.673
She's my friend.

58:31.675 --> 58:33.842
She has real goodness
in her heart.

58:33.844 --> 58:36.311
And so many times I did want
to break up with Biniyam

58:36.313 --> 58:39.014
and I wanted to leave him
because we had so many problems.

58:39.016 --> 58:42.551
And she saw the way things were
and she helped me to stick it out

58:42.553 --> 58:44.520
when I really didn't want to.

58:44.522 --> 58:47.723
So for them to say that she's talking
negative about him, they're lying.

58:47.725 --> 58:50.425
Wish has always tried
to sabotage our relationship.

58:50.427 --> 58:52.761
Avi's nanny wanted this
relationship to succeed.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.429
She loves Biniyam
and she loves me.

58:57.767 --> 59:00.802
Their actions
are just so heinous.

59:00.804 --> 59:04.239
Bini, how do you see
moving forward?

59:12.115 --> 59:14.116
[Ariela] But the thing is that--

59:17.120 --> 59:19.087
Oh, they're not my sisters.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.926
No. No, no, no, no, no.

59:25.395 --> 59:31.166
I'm sorry to you that your future
wife doesn't get along with your family.

59:31.168 --> 59:32.267
It's a really [bleep] situation.

59:35.271 --> 59:36.605
No, no.
What are they gonna fix?

59:36.607 --> 59:38.073
[Shaun] Okay, guys.

59:40.643 --> 59:43.946
There are still obviously a
lot of issues to be worked out,

59:43.948 --> 59:45.881
but we do wish you
the very best.

59:45.883 --> 59:48.050
And we'll be right back.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.953
<i>[Shaun] Coming up...</i>

59:50.955 --> 59:53.922
Hiromi, do you think
they're going to make it?

59:53.924 --> 59:59.294
I don't know. Ellie's coming
to me crying and upset.

1:00:00.797 --> 1:00:03.098
He doesn't listen to me
and he gets heated.

1:00:06.803 --> 1:00:08.103
<i>[Shaun] And later...</i>

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:10.806
Do you regret ordering

1:00:10.808 --> 1:00:13.408
the penis soup for Corey?

1:00:14.844 --> 1:00:18.714
[speaking Spanish]

1:00:18.716 --> 1:00:21.049
[Corey sighs]

1:00:23.653 --> 1:00:25.854
[man] Right here. Camera 4.
Quiet in the back, please.

1:00:25.856 --> 1:00:30.292
Thank you. And five,
four, three...

1:00:31.594 --> 1:00:33.395
Now I want to move on
to a couple

1:00:33.397 --> 1:00:35.430
whose plans to live
together in paradise

1:00:35.432 --> 1:00:39.001
quickly became a nightmare
no one could've predicted

1:00:39.003 --> 1:00:45.007
when a Category-5 hurricane
hit just before Ellie moved there.

1:00:45.009 --> 1:00:49.177
What was it like going to
Providencia after the hurricane hit?

1:00:55.918 --> 1:00:56.985
Yeah.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:13.635
But, Victor, you're here
in the US. That's a surprise.

1:01:13.637 --> 1:01:16.938
We already had the K-1 visa
process going...

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:19.941
- Yeah.
- Before I decide to move.

1:01:19.943 --> 1:01:21.677
And then COVID happened.

1:01:21.679 --> 1:01:24.079
So that got delayed.

1:01:24.081 --> 1:01:25.681
And that's kind of
when I was like,

1:01:25.683 --> 1:01:26.982
"Well, I'm just gonna move
down there."

1:01:26.984 --> 1:01:29.251
And then we could start,
you know,

1:01:29.253 --> 1:01:30.752
like, our life together.

1:01:30.754 --> 1:01:31.520
Yeah.

1:01:31.522 --> 1:01:33.955
And then the hurricane happened

1:01:33.957 --> 1:01:38.894
so our living situation
right now it's really tough

1:01:38.896 --> 1:01:41.897
because we can't go back
to Providencia

1:01:41.899 --> 1:01:46.068
because he can't leave yet
with the visa...

1:01:46.070 --> 1:01:48.403
[Victor speaking]

1:01:55.545 --> 1:01:57.279
Yeah.

1:01:57.281 --> 1:01:58.480
[Shaun] Well, it's so good
to have you here.

1:01:58.482 --> 1:01:59.581
Thank you.

1:01:59.583 --> 1:02:03.418
So, although it seems like
things are going well now,

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:06.321
unfortunately Victor
broke Ellie's trust

1:02:06.323 --> 1:02:08.824
before she moved to Providencia.

1:02:08.826 --> 1:02:14.796
And Ellie's friends have not been
quick to forgive Victor or let her forget.

1:02:14.798 --> 1:02:16.798
There's so much to do.

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:19.835
You're leaving so soon.

1:02:19.837 --> 1:02:22.003
So do you not think
it's a good idea?

1:02:22.005 --> 1:02:24.172
And it's a little...

1:02:24.174 --> 1:02:25.073
crazy.

1:02:25.075 --> 1:02:26.708
'Cause...

1:02:26.710 --> 1:02:28.009
Of his cheating.

1:02:28.011 --> 1:02:30.112
It just seems so deceptive.

1:02:30.114 --> 1:02:31.913
You're willing to just be, like,

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:34.683
"Oh, yeah. Of course I
will just move there for you."

1:02:34.685 --> 1:02:37.819
- I mean, he seems sincere.
- Hmm.

1:02:37.821 --> 1:02:39.755
And that's good enough for you?

1:02:39.757 --> 1:02:42.424
You're gonna sell
your whole life away

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:46.161
for this guy that completely
lied and cheated on you.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:51.266
- [exhales]
- [Shaun] Whoa. Okay.

1:02:53.069 --> 1:02:57.038
Hiromi had concerns with
Ellie's relationship with Victor.

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:58.406
Let's get her take.

1:02:58.408 --> 1:03:00.275
Please welcome Hiromi.

1:03:02.044 --> 1:03:04.079
Hi!

1:03:04.081 --> 1:03:04.713
Hi, Hiromi.

1:03:04.715 --> 1:03:06.081
Hello.

1:03:07.416 --> 1:03:10.418
[Shaun] You had reservations
from the very start

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:11.953
of Ellie and Victor's
relationship.

1:03:11.955 --> 1:03:13.889
What were the red flags
that you saw?

1:03:13.891 --> 1:03:17.159
[chuckling] Um, the cheating?

1:03:19.028 --> 1:03:22.631
Do you think that Ellie
saw the same red flags

1:03:22.633 --> 1:03:25.200
that you saw,
but chose to ignore them?

1:03:25.835 --> 1:03:28.136
They're still together,
so, yeah.

1:03:28.138 --> 1:03:30.038
- [Shaun] Okay.
- She chose to ignore them.

1:03:46.889 --> 1:03:47.322
[laughter]

1:03:47.957 --> 1:03:49.491
Sorry!

1:03:49.558 --> 1:03:54.529
I feel like you're still not taking
responsibility for your own actions, though.

1:03:54.531 --> 1:03:59.100
[Ariela] I think that's a man
who justifies something to himself.

1:03:59.102 --> 1:04:03.071
The truth is, I'm sure Ellie is
still hurting from the mistake.

1:04:04.974 --> 1:04:06.508
Do you trust him?

1:04:06.510 --> 1:04:08.243
Um...

1:04:09.879 --> 1:04:12.848
- The hesitation alone just kind of worries me.
- [Ellie] No.

1:04:12.850 --> 1:04:13.815
I'm just trying
to think of, like...

1:04:13.817 --> 1:04:16.051
I mean, I trust him,

1:04:16.053 --> 1:04:19.821
but I think that he has
an anger issue sometimes.

1:04:19.823 --> 1:04:22.424
He's going to therapy

1:04:22.426 --> 1:04:24.826
and he's trying to deal with it.

1:04:24.828 --> 1:04:27.429
But I also think he takes
it out on me sometimes.

1:04:27.431 --> 1:04:29.297
And that's not fair.

1:04:30.466 --> 1:04:33.969
[Shaun] Back in Providencia,
the combination of trauma,

1:04:33.971 --> 1:04:38.640
high stakes and stress led
to one of their biggest fights.

1:04:38.642 --> 1:04:41.843
To... our house.

1:04:41.845 --> 1:04:44.713
- To our house and to--
- And our future.

1:04:44.715 --> 1:04:47.649
I wonder when tourism
will come back.

1:04:47.651 --> 1:04:50.752
The bar is for everyone.

1:04:50.754 --> 1:04:53.555
Ask everyone here
that's been through COVID

1:04:53.557 --> 1:04:55.991
and hasn't had that income.

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:57.692
- But we still survive.
- That's seven months.

1:04:57.694 --> 1:04:58.526
They still survive.

1:04:58.528 --> 1:05:00.395
Who was sending you money?
I was.

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:02.631
- Yeah.
- Because you couldn't make any money from tourism.

1:05:02.633 --> 1:05:03.732
Exactly.

1:05:03.734 --> 1:05:06.635
You haven't given me
quite a lot of money.

1:05:06.637 --> 1:05:08.069
Really? You want to add it up?

1:05:08.071 --> 1:05:08.937
- Yeah.
- It is quite a lot.

1:05:08.939 --> 1:05:12.040
[Victor speaking]

1:05:12.042 --> 1:05:17.112
[Ellie] I never even said
I wanted it back.

1:05:18.114 --> 1:05:19.214
[sniffles]

1:05:23.619 --> 1:05:26.121
Wow, that was intense.

1:05:27.323 --> 1:05:31.860
It seems like money, though,
is an issue with you two.

1:05:31.862 --> 1:05:35.430
What is it about that that's
such a trigger for you two?

1:05:35.432 --> 1:05:38.199
He'll, you know,
call me cheap or whatever.

1:05:38.201 --> 1:05:43.071
Am I cheap? You know, I've
helped you out a lot and it's hurtful.

1:05:43.073 --> 1:05:46.741
And I just think for some
reason it triggers him

1:05:46.743 --> 1:05:48.209
and I don't know why.

1:06:00.656 --> 1:06:05.827
So in that argument that we saw,
you were talking about all the money

1:06:05.829 --> 1:06:08.530
that you had given Victor? How much
money do you think you've given him?

1:06:08.532 --> 1:06:12.200
Probably, like, $5,000.

1:06:12.202 --> 1:06:16.771
I also think because of that, you
know, respect me for helping you.

1:06:16.773 --> 1:06:19.107
You know I do!

1:06:19.109 --> 1:06:21.443
- By calling her cheap?
- Well, you know...

1:06:22.845 --> 1:06:23.611
Oh, my God!

1:06:23.613 --> 1:06:24.979
[scoffs]

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:27.682
I mean, we get to the point,
though, where we take that as a joke.

1:06:27.684 --> 1:06:32.020
[chuckling]
He does it all the time!

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:34.756
[Shaun] Ellie, does Victor
have access to your credit cards?

1:06:34.758 --> 1:06:35.890
Oh, no.

1:06:35.892 --> 1:06:38.893
[others laughing and murmuring]

1:06:38.895 --> 1:06:39.995
[Hiromi] Good for you!

1:06:39.997 --> 1:06:41.363
No way.

1:06:41.365 --> 1:06:44.666
- I'm not interested in her credit card, though.
- Oh, I bet!

1:06:44.668 --> 1:06:50.572
Who here combines finances? Are
your finances combined, Ari and Bini?

1:06:50.574 --> 1:06:54.776
Yeah, Bini just opened his first
bank account in the US the other day.

1:06:54.778 --> 1:06:56.778
- So that was pretty cool and pretty exciting.
- [Shaun] Okay!

1:06:56.780 --> 1:06:58.947
All right. Kenny and Armando?

1:06:58.949 --> 1:07:01.549
We do combine them,
but I'm the budgeter,

1:07:01.551 --> 1:07:04.019
so I get some of what
you're getting.

1:07:04.021 --> 1:07:07.756
[chuckling] But his Amazon
cart has 75 items in it right now.

1:07:07.758 --> 1:07:10.658
[all laugh]

1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:13.428
[Shaun] Hiromi, what do you think
the future of this relationship is?

1:07:13.430 --> 1:07:15.964
Do you think
they're going to make it?

1:07:16.832 --> 1:07:22.270
I don't know. Sorry, Ellie, but
Ellie's coming to me crying and upset

1:07:22.272 --> 1:07:27.909
and they're both, like, going at
it and not listening to each other.

1:07:27.911 --> 1:07:31.880
I mean, obviously I think he doesn't
listen to me and he gets heated

1:07:31.882 --> 1:07:34.716
and he probably thinks
the same thing about me.

1:07:34.718 --> 1:07:39.721
So we need to figure out that.
Why is that happening?

1:07:39.723 --> 1:07:42.424
Well, all couples need
to learn how to fight right.

1:07:42.426 --> 1:07:44.092
- [Ellie] Yeah--
- That's what we've done.

1:07:44.094 --> 1:07:45.693
We've learned
how to fight in a good way.

1:07:45.695 --> 1:07:47.195
Yeah.

1:07:49.865 --> 1:07:53.701
Well, money and trust those
are usually the two biggest issues

1:07:53.703 --> 1:07:55.503
- in a new relationship.
- [Kenny] In a relationship.

1:07:55.505 --> 1:07:57.906
So, I thank you for being here
and sharing your story,

1:07:57.908 --> 1:08:01.910
- and I wish you both the best of luck.
- [Victor] Thank you so much.

1:08:01.912 --> 1:08:03.611
- Hiromi, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1:08:03.613 --> 1:08:06.014
[Shaun] Taking a quick break.

1:08:06.016 --> 1:08:10.085
So much more to talk about. We'll be
right back with even more very soon.

1:08:10.087 --> 1:08:12.053
<i>[Shaun] Coming up...</i>

1:08:12.055 --> 1:08:14.622
You guys
weren't the nicest to Evelin.

1:08:14.624 --> 1:08:16.524
I don't believe that at all.

1:08:16.526 --> 1:08:18.693
Around when Taelor
came into the family,

1:08:18.695 --> 1:08:23.631
that's when I started seeing all
the problems that arised was...

1:08:23.633 --> 1:08:26.267
- Definitely not you.
- [Corey] The relationship that me and Evelin--

1:08:26.269 --> 1:08:28.069
Definitely just me or Evelin.

1:08:31.807 --> 1:08:34.242
[man] And five, four, three...

1:08:35.711 --> 1:08:37.512
Hello, everyone,
and welcome back

1:08:37.514 --> 1:08:40.615
<i>to 90 Day Finance: The
Other Way The Couples Tell All.</i>

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:43.885
Now I wanna catch up
with Corey and Evelin.

1:08:43.887 --> 1:08:47.989
We saw you break up, get
back together, break up again,

1:08:47.991 --> 1:08:50.492
and then get back together
and then get married.

1:08:50.494 --> 1:08:53.061
How are you guys doing today?

1:08:56.699 --> 1:09:00.535
When we got married it was one
of the best days of my life, for sure,

1:09:00.537 --> 1:09:04.572
and I think that our relationship
was the strongest that it's ever been.

1:09:04.574 --> 1:09:08.376
However, since then
it's been really difficult.

1:09:08.378 --> 1:09:11.479
Evelin, would you describe it
the same way?

1:09:11.481 --> 1:09:15.717
For me, it's more like he told me
that he has told me all the truth already,

1:09:15.719 --> 1:09:18.419
but I somehow I keep
finding out more things.

1:09:20.756 --> 1:09:23.258
Me, personally, I don't
think I could handle it.

1:09:23.926 --> 1:09:28.029
I got Evelin a therapist
to try to help--

1:09:28.031 --> 1:09:31.699
You got Evelin a therapist?

1:09:31.734 --> 1:09:34.602
[others laughing]

1:09:34.604 --> 1:09:37.972
All right, we're gonna dig
into that more a little later.

1:09:37.974 --> 1:09:42.177
But first, not everyone was on board
with Corey and Evelin's relationship.

1:09:42.179 --> 1:09:45.013
Neither of their
families approve.

1:09:45.214 --> 1:09:47.015
Let's take a look.

1:09:47.883 --> 1:09:49.851
- [Corey] Whoo-hoo!
- [woman] There's your soup.

1:09:49.853 --> 1:09:50.985
All right!

1:09:50.987 --> 1:09:52.387
I think she forgot the crab.

1:09:55.891 --> 1:09:57.292
[Speaking Spanish]

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:03.364
You are eating a penis.

1:10:05.834 --> 1:10:08.603
[laughs]

1:10:08.605 --> 1:10:10.405
Do you have, like, a
problem with me, or, like...

1:10:10.407 --> 1:10:15.143
I have a lot of problems
with you.

1:10:16.545 --> 1:10:21.416
I'm just calling to find out if you're
able to make it to the wedding or not.

1:10:23.018 --> 1:10:26.588
<i>Unfortunately, no, I don't...
I won't be able to make it.</i>

1:10:26.590 --> 1:10:29.657
<i>It's not been, I mean, easy,</i>

1:10:29.659 --> 1:10:34.696
<i>given our past relationship
with Evelin.</i>

1:10:34.698 --> 1:10:38.566
<i>It seems like Evelin
just makes decisions</i>

1:10:38.568 --> 1:10:41.936
<i>based upon what she wants
and doesn't really think that...</i>

1:10:41.938 --> 1:10:45.139
<i>She doesn't take your opinions
into consideration.</i>

1:10:46.775 --> 1:10:47.709
Good gracious!

1:10:47.711 --> 1:10:50.078
[others chuckling]

1:10:50.879 --> 1:10:53.815
Right now, we're going to bring
your family into the conversation.

1:10:53.817 --> 1:10:57.819
Please welcome Evelin's
sisters Lesly and Lipsy

1:10:57.821 --> 1:11:01.823
and Corey's brother Matt
and his wife Taelor.

1:11:01.825 --> 1:11:03.725
- How you doing?
- [women] Hi.

1:11:03.727 --> 1:11:05.893
Ha! This is so weird.

1:11:05.895 --> 1:11:07.562
- [Shaun] Welcome.
- Uh, hello.

1:11:07.564 --> 1:11:11.266
[Shaun] I'm going to start
with Lipsy and Lesly.

1:11:11.268 --> 1:11:16.104
- Do you regret ordering the penis soup for Corey?
- [others chuckling]

1:11:19.408 --> 1:11:21.542
It's not penis, though.
It's bull's balls.

1:11:21.544 --> 1:11:25.847
- Oh.
- Oh, that's so much better.

1:11:25.849 --> 1:11:29.183
[Shaun] That's so much better.
Okay, why do you think he deserved it?

1:11:29.185 --> 1:11:32.153
[speaking Spanish]

1:11:35.924 --> 1:11:38.660
Oh. My gosh.

1:11:38.662 --> 1:11:41.863
The problem I have
is just the motive behind it.

1:11:41.865 --> 1:11:45.266
[Evelin] Well, eating this,
it's not a bad thing.

1:11:45.268 --> 1:11:47.802
A lot of, like, macho men
go to eat it.

1:11:47.804 --> 1:11:51.406
- A lot of men...
- It was their motive behind it that I don't like.

1:11:51.408 --> 1:11:56.644
- [Jenny] Mmm-hmm.
- But they have a reason behind that motive.

1:11:56.646 --> 1:12:00.381
- That was an immature attempt to get back...
- Thank you, brother.

1:12:00.383 --> 1:12:04.052
But [chuckling]
it was kind of funny.

1:12:04.054 --> 1:12:06.854
Corey, what did the soup
taste like?

1:12:06.856 --> 1:12:08.690
- [laughter]
- [woman] Oh, no.

1:12:08.692 --> 1:12:10.758
It wasn't good at all.

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.596
Buttery, mushy...
I don't know. I don't like it.

1:12:15.598 --> 1:12:19.667
Well, Lesly and Lipsy,
now that they're married,

1:12:19.669 --> 1:12:23.838
how do you feel about him
and the relationship?

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:25.239
I still don't like him.

1:12:26.942 --> 1:12:29.043
No? Why not?

1:12:29.045 --> 1:12:33.081
[speaking Spanish]

1:12:43.492 --> 1:12:47.628
Of course, I love him,
and I wish I didn't, but...

1:12:47.630 --> 1:12:50.932
You know, that's just...
That's how the heart is.

1:12:50.934 --> 1:12:54.836
Sometimes
I really do wonder, like...

1:12:54.838 --> 1:12:56.904
I do wonder, though,
if maybe somehow

1:12:56.906 --> 1:12:58.706
we are just
too used to each other

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:01.175
'cause we've been together
for so long.

1:13:02.644 --> 1:13:06.814
Corey's family experienced
their dynamics first-hand

1:13:06.816 --> 1:13:10.118
when Corey and Evelin were
living with them in Washington.

1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:13.388
Matt and Taelor, how do you feel

1:13:13.390 --> 1:13:16.591
about Evelin being
your sister-in-law now?

1:13:16.593 --> 1:13:20.495
Well, to be honest, um...

1:13:20.497 --> 1:13:25.867
The time that I had spent
with Evelin wasn't the greatest.

1:13:25.869 --> 1:13:29.904
I feel like Corey had not a
whole lot of say in this relationship.

1:13:29.906 --> 1:13:33.307
He's just trapped.

1:13:33.309 --> 1:13:35.710
I would never trap someone
to be with me,

1:13:35.712 --> 1:13:39.280
'cause I believe in people staying
and being where they want to be.

1:13:40.582 --> 1:13:42.917
Taelor, do you have
a relationship with Evelin?

1:13:42.919 --> 1:13:46.988
Um... [chuckles] I
wouldn't call it a good one.

1:13:46.990 --> 1:13:48.923
She didn't like me, so...

1:13:48.925 --> 1:13:52.860
it kind of turned sour
pretty quickly, unfortunately.

1:13:52.862 --> 1:13:55.763
I realized that
they would only talk to me

1:13:55.765 --> 1:13:57.832
when their parents were around,

1:13:57.834 --> 1:14:01.669
and then when I was alone,
nobody, really, would care.

1:14:01.671 --> 1:14:03.838
Taelor, you said
that things turned sour.

1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:06.574
Was there, like,
an argument that you guys had?

1:14:06.576 --> 1:14:08.876
It was weird,
because Corey and I...

1:14:08.878 --> 1:14:10.945
- You're friends.
- We never had any issues. Yeah.

1:14:10.947 --> 1:14:13.147
So instead of, like,
reassuring Evelin,

1:14:13.149 --> 1:14:16.784
"No, Taelor's actually nice.
Like, I know she's not being fake,"

1:14:16.786 --> 1:14:18.719
he, like, flipped on me.

1:14:18.721 --> 1:14:23.891
You guys...
weren't the nicest to Evelin.

1:14:23.893 --> 1:14:26.627
I could see it,
and it made me very upset.

1:14:26.629 --> 1:14:28.796
I don't believe that at all.

1:14:28.798 --> 1:14:32.467
I do feel like I have become
very distant with my family.

1:14:32.469 --> 1:14:34.669
We were very, very close
for a while,

1:14:34.671 --> 1:14:38.940
and I feel like around when
Taelor came into the family, as well,

1:14:38.942 --> 1:14:41.409
- is when I started seeing that separation.
- See, that's the problem.

1:14:41.411 --> 1:14:42.910
Corey blames Taelor...

1:14:42.912 --> 1:14:44.846
and Matt blames Evelin.

1:14:44.848 --> 1:14:47.648
And I don't think
we are part of it.

1:14:47.650 --> 1:14:49.283
[Corey] Yeah, I think that
all of the problems that arise

1:14:49.285 --> 1:14:52.119
- had to do with...
- Definitely not you.

1:14:52.121 --> 1:14:55.056
- The relationship that me and Evelin had...
- Definitely just me or Evelin.

1:14:55.058 --> 1:14:58.960
And the relationship that you guys
have, and the clash that was going there.

1:14:58.962 --> 1:15:00.761
But I really miss you guys,

1:15:00.763 --> 1:15:02.763
and it's just sad
when I feel like

1:15:02.765 --> 1:15:06.701
I'm losing the relationship I
have with my family, in a sense.

1:15:06.703 --> 1:15:10.505
Matt, do you regret not
being there at the wedding?

1:15:10.507 --> 1:15:13.341
I feel bad,
but I don't regret not going.

1:15:21.750 --> 1:15:25.753
Okay, don't speak on my
relationship between Corey and myself.

1:15:25.755 --> 1:15:27.989
That's not your place, okay?

1:15:27.991 --> 1:15:30.424
To say that
I don't love my brother...

1:15:35.464 --> 1:15:36.864
Yeah.

1:15:36.866 --> 1:15:39.700
Well, it's different, okay,
life's circumstances.

1:15:39.702 --> 1:15:41.235
You were there.

1:15:42.571 --> 1:15:44.605
I've been here seven years

1:15:44.607 --> 1:15:46.841
and not one single person from
the family has visited me, either...

1:15:46.843 --> 1:15:50.578
- Whoa. That's a long time.
- And, you know, that's really hard.

1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:54.048
You know, Corey's not all
alone. He does have Jenny.

1:15:54.983 --> 1:15:58.052
- [Ellie] Oh, my God!
- [Ariela] Bad attempt at humor.

1:15:58.054 --> 1:16:00.755
- [Ellie] Oh, my God.
- Wow.

1:16:00.757 --> 1:16:04.592
Okay. I know this is
a touchy subject,

1:16:04.594 --> 1:16:06.994
but it is a topic
we need to discuss.

1:16:06.996 --> 1:16:09.830
We cannot talk about
Corey and Evelin's story

1:16:09.832 --> 1:16:11.599
without mentioning
a woman named Jenny,

1:16:11.601 --> 1:16:14.235
who Corey had
a relationship with

1:16:14.237 --> 1:16:18.406
while separated from,
but legally married to Evelin.

1:16:23.045 --> 1:16:24.278
[speaking Spanish]

1:16:27.983 --> 1:16:28.816
Do not touch me.

1:16:28.818 --> 1:16:29.417
[speaking Spanish]

1:16:30.919 --> 1:16:34.055
Yeah? Very good? [sighs]

1:16:34.057 --> 1:16:36.991
I want you to know...

1:16:37.225 --> 1:16:39.393
[speaking Spanish]

1:16:43.732 --> 1:16:44.832
[bleeps]

1:16:44.834 --> 1:16:48.269
[speaking Spanish]

1:17:01.416 --> 1:17:03.751
That's a big one, man.
[chuckles]

1:17:03.753 --> 1:17:05.753
Oh, that's a big question.
Can I take a sip?

1:17:05.755 --> 1:17:07.388
You told me you didn't, see?

1:17:08.957 --> 1:17:09.991
[Corey] Is there any
tequila back there?

1:17:09.993 --> 1:17:11.859
- [Corey] Okay.
- [Jenny] Ciao.

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:14.395
I have feelings
for Jenny as a person.

1:17:14.397 --> 1:17:16.931
I really do care about
the time we spent together,

1:17:16.933 --> 1:17:23.170
but my heart, and my love,
and my future is with Evelin.

1:17:29.611 --> 1:17:31.078
I don't blame you.

1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:34.849
You knew about her, but
what was the biggest surprise

1:17:34.851 --> 1:17:36.250
when you saw that scene?

1:17:46.595 --> 1:17:48.262
[bleep]

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:10.718
As I told you, Evelin, I have always
loved and wanted to be with you,

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:13.621
and I have made very,
very big mistakes

1:18:13.623 --> 1:18:18.325
and that I wish so badly
I didn't do that to you.

1:18:18.827 --> 1:18:22.163
I want to bring your sisters
back into the conversation.

1:18:22.165 --> 1:18:25.700
This obviously doesn't help
them like Corey any better.

1:18:25.702 --> 1:18:27.935
No, it doesn't.

1:18:27.937 --> 1:18:33.407
Lesly and Lipsy, what were you
thinking when you saw that conversation

1:18:33.409 --> 1:18:35.176
between Corey and Jenny?

1:18:35.178 --> 1:18:37.211
[speaking Spanish]

1:18:41.383 --> 1:18:46.921
It's disappointing, Corey. You have
to take inventory of your past mistakes

1:18:46.923 --> 1:18:48.622
and make it right.

1:18:48.624 --> 1:18:54.328
Evelin, is this something
you can get past?

1:18:54.330 --> 1:18:59.400
I don't know. I just feel like I don't
trust him at all, not even a little bit.

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:02.369
I don't want to be in a relationship
like that. I don't deserve that.

1:19:02.371 --> 1:19:04.872
There's no trust.
There is nothing.

1:19:04.874 --> 1:19:10.811
I want to ask Steven, how do you feel
about the fact that they were on a break?

1:19:10.813 --> 1:19:13.781
Do you think
that gives Corey a pass?

1:19:13.783 --> 1:19:18.753
Obviously, I'm not really
one to condemn here.

1:19:18.755 --> 1:19:22.857
Yeah, you're, like, the worst person
to actually be talking about that

1:19:22.859 --> 1:19:26.961
- out of literally everybody in the studio.
- [all laughing]

1:19:26.963 --> 1:19:30.965
Yeah, he shouldn't have done that
at all 'cause it did break her heart,

1:19:30.967 --> 1:19:32.266
and you can tell
she's broke on it.

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:35.569
[tearfully] And the fact of lying,
for me, throughout this time,

1:19:35.571 --> 1:19:36.570
waiting to tell me the truth,

1:19:36.572 --> 1:19:39.540
not having the balls
to tell me that earlier.

1:19:39.542 --> 1:19:44.178
He has the opportunity to
say the truth, but he didn't.

1:19:52.621 --> 1:19:56.056
[Shaun] Corey and Evelin, I can
see this has not been easy to relive.

1:19:56.058 --> 1:20:01.395
Now may be a good time to
take a break. We'll be right back.

1:20:01.397 --> 1:20:02.530
<i>[Shaun] Coming up...</i>

1:20:02.532 --> 1:20:06.467
I know you love your wife.

1:20:06.469 --> 1:20:10.137
I felt humiliated today having
to share as much as I did.

1:20:10.139 --> 1:20:13.307
So that's why you got to
just cut the [bleep] out.

1:20:17.245 --> 1:20:18.412
[Shaun] And we are back.

1:20:18.414 --> 1:20:21.949
Corey, you seem like
you want to say something.

1:20:21.951 --> 1:20:27.221
I have made mistakes that I am
very sorry for. And I want you to know

1:20:27.223 --> 1:20:29.623
that I do love you
with all of my heart.

1:20:29.625 --> 1:20:34.261
I just want to take ownership and say
that I'm sorry and move forward from it.

1:20:37.599 --> 1:20:40.901
Evelin, Corey,
what's next for you guys?

1:20:40.903 --> 1:20:45.806
I feel like we have try a lot
and it's in this point

1:20:45.808 --> 1:20:48.809
where it's, like, way too
toxic, and Corey keeps trying

1:20:48.811 --> 1:20:52.646
and I always end up giving in
because there's all this scare,

1:20:52.648 --> 1:20:54.081
we're so used to being together.

1:20:54.083 --> 1:20:58.085
- It's such a vicious cycle.
- I just--

1:20:59.354 --> 1:21:00.654
[exhales]

1:21:00.656 --> 1:21:04.592
I was thinking that maybe it
would... since we don't get...

1:21:04.594 --> 1:21:07.261
a good breakup, maybe we
should get a therapist to do that.

1:21:07.263 --> 1:21:09.797
You know, if we're not a good
relationship maybe we should have

1:21:09.799 --> 1:21:12.733
- a therapist to break up.
- [Ariela] I think therapists can help you, like,

1:21:12.735 --> 1:21:18.005
respectfully, you know, like, untangle
our lives from each other because...

1:21:18.007 --> 1:21:19.907
- Certainly.
- [Ariela] It's so hard.

1:21:19.909 --> 1:21:23.677
I really identify with you guys'
story a lot because it kind of

1:21:23.679 --> 1:21:26.780
reminded me
of feeling mad at Bini.

1:21:26.782 --> 1:21:29.850
Bini felt bad about all the stuff
that he did, but I just remind him

1:21:29.852 --> 1:21:31.752
"You [bleep] up, you
[bleep] up, you [bleep] up."

1:21:31.754 --> 1:21:33.520
I feel like you guys
are at that point.

1:21:33.522 --> 1:21:35.923
Evelin keeps reminding you
of your mistakes.

1:21:35.925 --> 1:21:37.591
It's not reminding him,
it's I'm finding out

1:21:37.593 --> 1:21:39.393
so I'm complaining
about these things.

1:21:39.395 --> 1:21:42.963
- Like, I knew that. Why you didn't told me?
- So that's the toxicity.

1:21:42.965 --> 1:21:46.901
- Yeah, we do need to fix that.
- [Corey] And that's what it is.

1:21:46.903 --> 1:21:50.137
It's the fact of trying
to move past this.

1:21:50.805 --> 1:21:53.207
I'm really sorry to hear...

1:21:53.209 --> 1:21:55.743
[sighs] that that is
where you guys are.

1:21:55.745 --> 1:22:00.814
That's really unfortunate after all
this time that you have been together.

1:22:00.816 --> 1:22:04.685
Thank you so much for sharing
your story and coming on today.

1:22:04.687 --> 1:22:08.856
And thank you to your family
for joining us as well.

1:22:08.858 --> 1:22:11.825
We appreciate you being here,
I know this was not easy.

1:22:11.827 --> 1:22:12.793
But thank you.

1:22:12.795 --> 1:22:14.662
- Thanks for having us.
- Thanks for having us.

1:22:14.664 --> 1:22:18.666
And that's all for <i>90 Day Fiance:
The Other Way The Couples Tell All.</i>

1:22:18.668 --> 1:22:20.968
Thank you so much
to all of you for being here

1:22:20.970 --> 1:22:25.673
and letting us into your lives
through some very personal situations.

1:22:25.675 --> 1:22:28.208
You've all had huge hurdles
to overcome

1:22:28.210 --> 1:22:31.412
and we appreciate you sharing
your challenges with us.

1:22:31.414 --> 1:22:33.180
I wish you all the very best.

1:22:33.182 --> 1:22:34.782
Goodnight, everybody.

1:22:34.816 --> 1:22:36.583
[all] Bye!

1:22:36.585 --> 1:22:37.785
- [Shaun] Bye, guys.
- [Biniyam] Bye, guys.

1:22:37.787 --> 1:22:40.020
- [Shaun] Thank you.
- [Kenny] Bye, everyone.

1:22:40.022 --> 1:22:41.889
[Shaun] Great seeing you
again, bye-bye.

1:22:41.891 --> 1:22:43.290
Thank you.

1:22:43.292 --> 1:22:45.259
- Bye, Sumit.
- Nice meeting you.

1:22:46.628 --> 1:22:48.696
- [Kenny] Wait, I wanna say something to you.
- [Steven] Okay.

1:22:48.698 --> 1:22:52.833
I know you love your wife
and you don't wanna hurt her,

1:22:52.835 --> 1:22:55.536
so that's why you gotta
just cut the [bleep] out.

1:22:55.570 --> 1:22:56.770
[softly] Yeah.

1:22:56.938 --> 1:23:01.175
I felt humiliated today, having
to share as much as I did.

1:23:01.609 --> 1:23:03.344
- You can do it.
- Thanks, Kenny.

1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:06.613
I think it's a good
humiliation, though,

1:23:06.615 --> 1:23:09.016
I think it would bring about
that contrite spirit

1:23:09.018 --> 1:23:10.351
that's needed
to make real change.

1:23:10.353 --> 1:23:12.953
See you. Nice meeting
you guys in person.

1:23:38.847 --> 1:23:41.215
Individually, I love them
both, I think they're great,

1:23:41.217 --> 1:23:43.017
but I'd like to see how it goes.

1:23:43.019 --> 1:23:44.051
Yeah.

1:23:44.053 --> 1:23:46.086
Hopefully they'll get it.

1:23:47.522 --> 1:23:50.057
<i>[Evelyn] I wanted to kill him.</i>

1:23:50.059 --> 1:23:52.593
Hearing him say that
he had feelings for her...

1:23:52.595 --> 1:23:56.130
I wanted to destroy him.

1:23:59.734 --> 1:24:03.003
My sense of trust has been
completely broken.

1:24:03.638 --> 1:24:08.175
<i>But I think
that if I see a change,</i>

1:24:08.743 --> 1:24:10.310
maybe there will be a chance.

1:24:14.416 --> 1:24:18.118
Oh, my God. That was a lot.

1:24:18.953 --> 1:24:21.088
So, how do you think it went?

1:24:39.274 --> 1:24:41.041
[all saying farewells]

1:24:43.278 --> 1:24:45.679
Expanding our family
is a huge thing.

1:24:45.681 --> 1:24:48.315
Thank you, everybody.
Nice meeting you.

1:24:48.317 --> 1:24:50.384
At the end of the day,
it's really what we want.

1:24:50.386 --> 1:24:53.153
And I don't think we're gonna
make everybody happy with it.

1:24:55.723 --> 1:24:57.591
<i>[Ariela] I'm feeling upset</i>

1:24:57.593 --> 1:25:00.594
because I understand that
there's no salvaging

1:25:00.596 --> 1:25:02.796
my relationship
with Biniyam's sisters

1:25:02.798 --> 1:25:04.865
and so I feel like it's really
just a waste of time

1:25:04.867 --> 1:25:06.166
to continue this back and forth.

1:25:07.936 --> 1:25:09.269
[Biniyam speaking]

1:25:23.384 --> 1:25:25.085
<i>Hasta la vista, baby!</i>
