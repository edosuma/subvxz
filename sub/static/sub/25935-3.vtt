00:07.600 --> 00:10.359
I'm here to see Dawnie
and my little one.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.599
- I hate him.
- You don't mean that.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.679
She never would have had it
if it wasn't for him.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.879
I'll let Em see her mum off
without me there spoiling it.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.879
He's gone.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.079
Matt insists
we return to Sydney.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.319
There could be
a heartbroken mother back there.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.679
I can't be his father
until I know

00:28.680 --> 00:30.599
whoever gave him up
doesn't regret it.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.879
- It was her choice.
- Under what circumstances?

00:33.880 --> 00:37.479
Livvy, how about we all go,
and we stay at Douglas's...

00:37.480 --> 00:40.679
well, Matt's now...
and we don't tell any of them?

00:40.680 --> 00:43.679
It sits there empty.
They would want you to stay.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.959
I'll call and check.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.359
Ah, we'd rather you didn't

00:46.360 --> 00:48.039
until we've shared news
of the wedding.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.839
Let me unsettle you
with a proposition.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.519
It's partly why I'm back.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.519
You are worth more at the clinic
than involved in interior design

00:56.520 --> 00:58.119
and its attendant frippery.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.359
- He's got a designer?
- From London. He's not said who.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.159
You didn't mention me?

01:03.160 --> 01:05.438
What's this surprise
you keep smirking over?

01:05.440 --> 01:09.479
Ten years ago, in London.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.959
We were lovers.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.839
What's that for?

01:13.840 --> 01:17.639
For trusting me to wander off
and know I won't wander.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.599
You'll be getting your notice
if you're not careful!

01:19.600 --> 01:20.799
You reckon I care?

01:20.800 --> 01:23.200
You're a joke.
Shove your job.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.879
I came here to be near James,

01:26.880 --> 01:28.759
and I stayed in the vain hope
that he'd return.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.039
Where's the point in staying?

01:30.040 --> 01:32.399
What we're achieving here
together.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.960
You're a fine surgeon.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.800 --> 03:06.359
You're sure you're up to it?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.280
Could you turn that off, please?

03:09.960 --> 03:13.239
There.
Is that all?

03:13.240 --> 03:16.639
- Thank you.
- Give Mr. Briggs my condolences.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.640
I will.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.160
If he's there.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.640
It's not well timed.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.160
"The whole world in His hands."

03:32.200 --> 03:33.520
Mm!

03:36.480 --> 03:39.079
- Don't go overdoing it.
- I have to attend.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.439
- If Roy can miss it...
- He won't.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.080
- Of course he won't.
- Still no sign of him.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.759
Now, the specialist's arriving
at 2:00, so it's best you...

03:47.760 --> 03:49.039
I don't need him
to tell me what I know.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.199
Just wait and see.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.679
Best not eat anything
in case he wants to operate.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.599
These aren't surgeon's hands,
not anymore, whatever he does.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.439
- You can't tell after only...
- Don't patronize me.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.839
We'll see.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.080
I can't bring this back
any more than Roy can Dawn.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.119
Well, we'll be off
in ten minutes.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.480
Mm-hmm.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.800
Could you...

04:14.160 --> 04:15.760
It's just that song.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.840
The gods really are chuckling.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.520
Leave it.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.079
So we're all saying goodbye
to Mrs. Briggs.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.559
Me too?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.759
No.
It's not for small boys.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.280
'Cause she's dead?

04:59.320 --> 05:01.039
Yes.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.599
She's going to God?

05:03.600 --> 05:04.959
Yes, she is.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.639
But God's in the synagogue.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.319
Well, he's in the church too.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.159
But what if he's not?

05:10.160 --> 05:12.640
God is everywhere.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.519
I'll say goodbye to her here,
then.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.200
Good boy.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.759
The subtleties
of comparative religion.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.719
I wish the world
saw through his eyes.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.839
Life would be simpler.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.120
Oh, wait.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.359
It is true, though.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.559
What?

05:37.560 --> 05:39.679
Roy doesn't have to be
in the church.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.799
He must come.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.239
He's putting Emma first.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.279
He's not a man who copes well
with pain.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.120
But to not be there?

05:59.640 --> 06:01.760
Bloody coward.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.160
Two cases?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.279
I'm not sure how long I'll stay.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.479
Well, not too long, I hope.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.840
We're sure to be up there soon.
We'll... We'll catch up, huh?

06:50.560 --> 06:54.039
She's not rushing back,
if her bags are an indication.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.959
Would it help
if I talked to her?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.039
No.
Perhaps another time.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.399
Shabbat's an invitation,
not an obligation.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.759
It's more than just that,
but that is a huge change.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.160
Yes.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.599
I'm being discussed.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.160
Of course.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.120
Is it so threatening?

07:14.760 --> 07:17.479
A Jewish household?

07:17.480 --> 07:20.759
Every Friday night?

07:20.760 --> 07:22.479
Rightly or wrongly,
I don't approve.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.119
I must find a way to.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.200
And if you can't?

07:29.920 --> 07:33.600
Like Mr. Briggs, I remove myself
for the sake of others.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.639
It just adds to my list
of confusions.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.200
Perhaps Sydney
will bring clarity.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.280
I hope so.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.599
Here we are.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.879
I want to go see David!

07:59.880 --> 08:03.039
- He is at Ash Park.
- Then let's go there, then!

08:03.040 --> 08:05.999
- Not yet.
- But I want to.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.919
We will talk about it
when you've slept, all right?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.599
I'll settle him.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.399
You can take
one of the smaller bedrooms.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.959
- If they're stripped, there's...
- I'll manage.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.760
His pajamas
are in the blue case.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.119
Thank you.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.479
Come on, young man.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.239
I don't want to!

08:26.240 --> 08:29.319
You didn't sleep a wink
on the plane.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.879
I want to go see David.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.039
Sleep will help her too.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.879
To a degree.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.239
You can't blame her.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.000
Only if she's not willing
to embrace what's right.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.759
The house has been aired.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.119
Someone's here.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.679
I thought you said
that Grandmother contacts

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
whenever she visits.

08:50.681 --> 08:52.399
Always.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.479
"The Riviera Mode."

08:54.480 --> 08:57.359
James?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.199
Surely not.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.320
I'll check the bedrooms.

09:27.160 --> 09:31.079
You can wait here if you'd
rather avoid the barrage.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.719
It'll come from concern.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.320
- If it gets too much...
- I'll cope.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.920
Oh, dear, look.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.559
I'd hoped to see you.
How are you?

09:53.560 --> 09:56.479
Battered. Bruised.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.959
But less so each day.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.239
Still no indication
of who might have caused it?

10:01.240 --> 10:02.639
No.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.999
I'm told you didn't see
the vehicle.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.199
Just lights.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.519
Well, I trust you see
justice done.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.840
Mm.
This brings context.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.760
Whatever we can do.
Anything.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.080
Got a spare hand?

10:21.480 --> 10:23.080
I hear you're going.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.039
Nothing to James.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.520
I insist.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.359
Emma's continued
bitterness is alarming.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.559
I fear,
should Mr. Briggs attend...

10:52.560 --> 10:54.319
I doubt he will.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.519
I'm sure she'll blame him
should he not.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.599
Damned if he does,
damned if he doesn't.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.919
Mm, she's determined
to make him the culprit.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.199
I'll speak to her again.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.200
- Would you?
- Yes.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.519
Oh, and there's Mr. Fox.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.119
Suffering wherever one looks.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.199
I'll see you inside.
Perhaps get a seat at the back.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.280
- I'll be there if you need me.
- Thank you.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.280
Excuse me.
May I have a quick word?

11:24.880 --> 11:27.880
- I'm glad he's not coming.
- He does care.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.159
He doesn't want to
make it worse.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.799
If he comes,
I'll ask him to get out.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.239
Emma.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.959
It's not what your mother
would want.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.200
She didn't want to die.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.200
I know that.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.919
I've done a scout around.
No sign.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.239
- It's just not like him.
- No, it isn't.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.600
He'll come.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.280
There is something
you could do to help.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.359
We should go to a hotel.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.919
Georgie's just settled.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.559
Well, settle him again.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.559
It's up to you.
You want James involved?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.719
Why didn't he say
he was coming back?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.879
Why didn't anyone call?

12:32.880 --> 12:34.559
The whole thing changes.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.919
I mean, for you too,
if he talks to Henry.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.679
Perhaps it's as it should be.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.759
Georgie's his son.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.119
He should have a say.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.120
The son he abandoned
for the high life?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.759
Don't.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.679
I want you to do what's right,
and I'm a villain?

12:50.680 --> 12:54.079
And suddenly he's a father again
because it suits you?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.479
What about, "How could
he forget about Georgie?"

12:56.480 --> 12:58.479
You want it all your own way.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.879
I'm just saying,
since he's here...

13:00.880 --> 13:02.519
Which he is.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.359
Here. Now.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.600
It seems decided for us.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.279
What is happening with you?

13:11.280 --> 13:12.759
You're the one grabbing on to

13:12.760 --> 13:14.519
whatever
moral high ground suits.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.879
I know what's best for my son.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.080
It was "our" son yesterday.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.599
Just tell James
I'll meet him up at the park.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.600
I want a chance to make
mypoint, just he and I.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.079
They're married?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.520
They didn't want you
to feel obliged to fly home.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.199
It was a low-key affair.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.399
I was coming back
for business anyway.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.559
Well, the choice
would have been nice.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.280
Not that I would have taken it,
given this.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.199
So not weight?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.919
- Weight? Me?
- Didn't think you could.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.879
- Nor did I.
- Whose?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.800
You have bigger issues.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.960
You are sent from heaven.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.440
Help me, please?

14:29.680 --> 14:33.199
O Lord, you have
searched me out and known me.

14:33.200 --> 14:37.479
You know when I sit,
when I stand,

14:37.480 --> 14:40.519
comprehend my thoughts
long before.

14:40.520 --> 14:45.159
You discern my path
and the places where I rest.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.239
You are acquainted
with all my ways.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.439
Where shall I go
from your spirit?

14:52.440 --> 14:57.239
Or where shall I flee
from your presence?

14:57.240 --> 15:00.199
If I ascend into heaven,
you are there.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.399
If I make my bed in the grave,
you are there also.

15:04.400 --> 15:09.199
If I spread out my wings
towards the morning

15:09.200 --> 15:12.119
or dwell in the uttermost parts
of the sea,

15:12.120 --> 15:16.119
even there your hand
shall lead me,

15:16.120 --> 15:19.200
and your right hand
shall hold me.

15:20.560 --> 15:25.079
If I say, "Surely the darkness
will cover me

15:25.080 --> 15:27.440
and the night
will enclose me..."

15:30.320 --> 15:34.759
...the darkness
is no darkness with you,

15:34.760 --> 15:38.280
but the night
is as clear as the day.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.360
The darkness and the light
are both alike.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.120
I love you, Dawnie.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.239
He has a point.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.279
I have forfeited any rights
to have a say.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.839
Georgie's ourson.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.119
I made a choice.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.599
It broke my heart, but I did.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.999
It's you and Matt now.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.599
You can't think he's being fair?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.160
I don't know.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.520
I need to hear
what he has to say.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.279
The thought of giving him up

16:33.280 --> 16:34.639
would be monstrous
for any mother.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.919
- It might come to that.
- But it might well not.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.679
That's what I've said.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.599
Just the thought...

16:40.600 --> 16:42.960
- He's asleep?
- Yes.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.600
I think it's best he doesn't
see me while I'm here.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.119
At least until this is resolved.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.199
If he's adjusting to Matt,
perhaps not at all.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.240
I don't want to confuse him.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.919
You seem on Matt's side.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.599
This isn't about sides.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.119
Don't make it combative.
This is about understanding.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.039
You owe me your support,
James...

17:04.040 --> 17:06.199
Stop!

17:06.200 --> 17:09.358
If there's a victim in this,
it's Georgie.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.480
He was dragged into it
by both of us.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.839
We think of him first,
anyone else second.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.400
I'll see Matt.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.679
He's moved on.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.760
It's easy for him.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.999
Georgie is best with me.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.120
And if not?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.080
Of course he is.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.999
He has another mother
out there somewhere,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.479
if she wants him.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.199
Would he thank you
in years to come?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.879
It's not just about now.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.160
Will you lie his entire life?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.879
Roy turned up.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.159
Sarah's taken the car.
She's gone with him.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.239
Ah, where?

18:18.240 --> 18:20.439
She said there'll be a note
at home.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.079
- She said you'd understand.
- Oh.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.759
I've got another message
to deliver.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.199
Of course.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.759
Sarah thought you should know.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.039
Roy came.
He didn't want to upset you.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.399
He prayed for your mum
out here.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.959
- And for your sister.
- Yeah.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.639
Well, there you are, you see?

18:40.640 --> 18:43.239
Yeah, well, where is he?

18:43.240 --> 18:47.080
He is putting you
before himself.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.280
You know where we are
if you need anything.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.640
Thank you.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.639
George, I accept that Sarah's
concerned for Mr. Briggs,

19:05.640 --> 19:08.679
but this is your first public
appearance as husband and wife.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.879
It's unseemly to dash off.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.759
And it hasn't gone unnoticed.

19:12.760 --> 19:16.239
- She knows what's best.
- I'm sure.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.040
Keep us informed,
as we will you.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.719
It's their life.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.599
Secondary to all others,
it seems.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.079
Roy's a dear friend.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.079
And George is her husband.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.760
None of my affair.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.999
Just wanted to say,
sorry about that.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.319
Fine.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.959
No idea who did it?

19:43.960 --> 19:45.120
No.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.120
I hope you believed James.
We're just mates.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.119
I don't care.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.880
Right.

20:07.480 --> 20:11.879
I hope it's exciting,
however it shapes up.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.319
I won't commit if it's not.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.159
It's got to be something
worth missing you for.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.480
Right answer.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.840
She seems pretty lost.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.240
I'll be there for her.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.360
I'll ring you tonight.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.799
Where are we going?

20:46.800 --> 20:50.439
Oh! We are going to visit
Mr. Briggs.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.999
Mr. Briggs is there!
Hello, Mr. Briggs!

20:53.000 --> 20:55.119
- G'day, mate.
- We're gonna visit his camp.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.519
- May I sit in the front?
- Yeah, hop in.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.160
Yes, sir.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.800
That is not for you.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.759
- You've told George?
- He'll understand.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.440
Did you say goodbye
to Mrs. Briggs?

21:13.400 --> 21:15.360
Yes, mate.
We did.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.039
It's good to meet you.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.960
Can think of
better circumstances.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.159
Well, you have my father's
seal of approval.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.319
Maybe not after this.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.880
So.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.959
So.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.320
You've taken quite a stance.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.400
What you're proposing
comes with a great deal of risk.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.400
I have my reasons.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.720
I have a son.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.360
His mother left
when he was only two.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.959
He's out there somewhere.
I've no idea where.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.000
She cut all ties, disappeared.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.759
I know what it's like
to yearn for one's kid.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.120
Right.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.039
Does Olivia know?

22:34.040 --> 22:35.800
No.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.279
Tell her.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.559
I want her to make the choice
for the right reason,

22:41.560 --> 22:43.639
not because of anything
to do with me.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.040
It would help her understand.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.399
I want her to accept
that Georgie has a real mother.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.279
Her maternity doesn't trump all.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.919
As cut and dried as that?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.999
I love her and Georgie.
I want them both.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.559
But not
at the expense of someone

22:59.560 --> 23:01.520
who's aching for their son
as much as I do for mine.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.079
I will tell her, but only after
she's made her choice.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.080
A test.

23:09.081 --> 23:12.120
That's not how I see it.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.160
I have complicated
enough of things myself.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.120
I won't judge.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.559
I just hope your need to do this

23:22.560 --> 23:25.879
doesn't come at the expense
of Olivia and Georgie.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.200
You think I don't?

23:30.840 --> 23:34.679
I'm on this number if you need
anything to facilitate matters.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.680
I'm so glad I rang.
We'll talk.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.240
Georgie's still
dead to the world.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.399
What?

23:46.400 --> 23:50.519
I just rang my publishers
to let them know I'm back.

23:50.520 --> 23:54.599
20th Century Fox contacted
while we were in the air.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.399
She'd been trying to reach me
in Hawaii.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.359
"On the Beach" and "Summer of
the Seventeenth Doll"

23:58.360 --> 23:59.479
are shooting.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.679
"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison"
was a hit.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.039
Australian stories are in vogue.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.879
They want to option my novels.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.479
What does that mean?

24:09.480 --> 24:12.399
Fame. Moola.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.719
Perhaps the chance
to adapt them.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.599
She'll keep me informed.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.559
Publicity?

24:19.560 --> 24:22.879
Possibly.
I'll tell her if needs must.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.799
Her?
What happened to Ed?

24:25.800 --> 24:28.679
Overseas.
I'm dealing with his assistant.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.159
Probably best.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.799
I'd say so.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.359
I'm happy for you.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.319
I'm happy for me.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.959
Georgie?

24:37.960 --> 24:39.200
Still asleep.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.799
I'll take a quick peep
before I go.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.079
I'll make sure it's safe.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.679
Of course.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.840
What now?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.839
Let's talk.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.240
Without anger, I hope.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.559
As do I.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.480
It's best dealt with, Livvy.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.760
I can understand.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.399
So, you. Whose?

25:16.400 --> 25:19.119
- What did he say?
- It's their business.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.000
Well?

25:24.480 --> 25:25.720
It's Henry's.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.479
James was my last hope.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.999
No.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.239
You're your own, if you're
willing to embrace what's right.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.040
We can be happy.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.439
- If.
- Only if.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.760
Trust me.

25:48.960 --> 25:51.479
So said James and Lloyd.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.080
Well, I'm not them.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.280
I'm not sure.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.760
Then we have no future.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.920
Possibly not.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.240
This is fun.
Yum.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.599
We want Roy at Shabbat,
don't we?

26:42.600 --> 26:45.119
You got to come.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.479
Come home.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.120
What's home now?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.080
Your friends are a start.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.519
These days,
I prefer this to a pin.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.920
Gives a better sense
of what's what.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.640
No.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.280
No.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.880
No.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.799
Around the flexor tendons,
the cuts were quite deep.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.120
Very deep.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.879
The median nerve's been cut.

27:47.880 --> 27:51.039
Yes, I would say so.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.919
I'm sorry.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.439
We'll know more after surgery.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.719
Is there any point?

27:56.720 --> 28:01.119
The best surgeon I know for this
is Benjamin Frank.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.879
I'll phone him and make sure
you're at the top of his list.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.679
As they so tactfully say
in the Journal of Joint Surgery,

28:08.680 --> 28:10.559
"as for the tendons
in the fingers,

28:10.560 --> 28:12.840
excellent results
are not common."

28:13.800 --> 28:16.199
9% success rate.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.519
Delicate surgery
will certainly be beyond you.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
I knew it.

28:20.521 --> 28:22.119
At best?

28:22.120 --> 28:24.279
I'll be lecturing in anatomy.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.600
Let's wait
until we see what's what.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.080
Looks like
you're looking for a surgeon.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.280
And I'm looking for a future.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.839
I didn't realize how much
I'd missed this house.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.400
It never fails to soothe.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.679
We had thought it
best resolved privately,

29:41.680 --> 29:43.039
without others fussing.

29:43.040 --> 29:47.719
Anna explained,
as it applies to herself too.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.879
I've left that
with James and Carolyn.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.479
This doesn't sound like Matthew.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.799
Not the one we knew.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.399
Try to get through to him.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.919
I've left Ash Park
to avoid involvement.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.639
At least let him explain.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.440
It may lead to something.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.599
It must come from him.
I won't interfere.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.400
- Ahh.
- Elizabeth.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.879
It would seem like life's
decided against us

30:15.880 --> 30:17.719
keeping this private.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.759
It would seem so.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.599
Share what you will.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.040
Shall we?

30:37.040 --> 30:39.239
And you blame me
for keeping my distance?

30:39.240 --> 30:40.759
Of course
we're going to comment.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.359
It's my choice!
I should never have come back.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.919
And you dropped Henry,

30:45.920 --> 30:47.919
so don't all of a sudden
turn into his champion.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.519
I'm simply stating facts.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.479
It's the only child
he's likely to ever have.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.399
And it's my right to raise it
as I decide.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.119
As a single mother?

30:56.120 --> 30:58.479
Times have changed
since I was born.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.920
Not enough.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.919
I am delighted for you,
but please understand,

31:04.920 --> 31:08.599
you will be viewed as cheap
and your child a bastard,

31:08.600 --> 31:11.039
as we would have been.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.639
That's society's problem,
not mine.

31:13.640 --> 31:14.959
Easily said.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.879
Sarah sailed through with David.

31:16.880 --> 31:20.279
She was engaged to George.
He was David's father.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.199
They had the goodwill
of the town.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.599
You are a successful author
in the wider world.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.559
Think what the gutter press
will make of it.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.919
So, what, I slink off
and give my child away,

31:28.920 --> 31:30.000
like you did with me?

31:35.840 --> 31:38.479
I'm sorry.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.959
No, you're right.
I did.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.200
I doubt you'd have had as
blessed a childhood if I hadn't.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.879
You'd have been tarred
by the stigma.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.120
But I'd have had my mother.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.840
We missed out on so much.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.080
I'm not saying this to hurt you.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.399
If you had your time again,

32:03.400 --> 32:06.639
knowing all you missed,
what would you do?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.840
I'd like to think the same.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.439
Perhaps not.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.359
Could you see it as
my reliving history for you

32:18.360 --> 32:21.959
in your grandchild, in a time
more likely to be forgiving?

32:21.960 --> 32:26.519
And if not, I've been raised
with the strength to cope.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.679
But nothing to Papa.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.560
And nothing to Henry.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.759
I won't have my choice to tell
made for me.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.440
It's my baby, my life.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.599
His baby, his life.

32:42.600 --> 32:46.559
Don't let what happened
between Livvy and me affect you.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.959
That's all I'll say.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.160
Good.
Subject closed.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.559
Can I be honest?

32:59.560 --> 33:01.120
Of course.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.439
When Olivia speaks of her time
as a Bligh,

33:05.440 --> 33:09.359
it's with a mixture
of love and vehemence.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.759
She judges and disapproves
of so much.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.199
She said in leaving you all

33:15.200 --> 33:18.120
that she wished to leave
the complications behind.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.240
My current thoughts
are somewhat similar.

33:24.680 --> 33:29.279
The poor girl was drawn into
an unenviable situation.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.559
It's what led to her choice
to acquire Georgie.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.959
Buy.
Let's call a spade a spade.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.359
- She bought him.
- From love.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.719
I see no merit
in choosing the harsher term.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.759
I... I just...
I want to face the truth.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.039
No more lies.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.759
That's what she said
when she left Ash Park,

33:48.760 --> 33:51.879
until it suited her differently.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.399
Are you trying to drive a wedge
between us?

33:54.400 --> 33:57.559
No, I'm laying out the facts.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.279
You're judging her.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.360
And us.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.359
You're a family
with this incredible ability

34:07.360 --> 34:10.438
to view things
through a self-serving lens.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.920
I see.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.399
I came here
to avoid complications.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.039
I won't embrace yours.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.799
I will simply say that Olivia
has suffered enough.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.239
I trust your self-righteousness
doesn't add to that.

34:26.239 --> 34:30.080
Sense of right.
Not remotely the same.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.958
I hope this doesn't
come between us.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.120
As do I.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.080
Certainly not the Matthew
we know.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.519
We won't stay.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.119
I've telephoned Prudence, and
she'll be delighted to have us.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.919
We three, James?

35:04.920 --> 35:07.519
Olivia said you were unsure
about Georgie seeing you,

35:07.520 --> 35:09.199
so, wise perhaps?

35:09.200 --> 35:11.399
- I was just leaving.
- What happened?

35:11.400 --> 35:14.439
We're best away.

35:14.440 --> 35:19.319
Um, letters of condolence
are in order for Mr. Briggs.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.559
His wife, Dawn, has died,
and their baby.

35:22.560 --> 35:26.399
- No.
- It's dreadful.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.359
So Prudence's, yes?

35:28.360 --> 35:31.519
I'd like to stay.
Is that all right?

35:31.520 --> 35:34.039
- Of course.
- I will behave.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.799
No, I'd like you to.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.080
Poor Mr. Briggs.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.719
That's terrible news.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.919
You still have your child,
so there is hope.

35:44.920 --> 35:45.960
You hold to that.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.280
You know where we are
if things become too strident.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.079
Right, before Georgie stirs?

35:52.080 --> 35:54.440
And let us tell Ash Park
in our own time.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.359
My great-grandchild.

36:00.360 --> 36:05.559
It's a blessing,
whatever the complexities.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.000
We'll talk.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.919
Blessings is a start.

36:17.920 --> 36:21.319
And I've somewhere to run now.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.400
If needed.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.319
Where's Elizabeth?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.800
She's just left.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.919
You encouraged honesty.
Stay.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.359
I did.
But no.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.919
I hope you soften.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.000
Please.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.799
We're writing to Roy Briggs...

36:56.800 --> 36:58.399
We're doing what we came to do.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.079
We see the doctor tomorrow,
and we set this thing in motion.

37:01.080 --> 37:04.320
That's it.
Finished. Done.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.639
There.

37:15.640 --> 37:18.199
- What do you think?
- That's good.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.279
Now we're a Jewish home.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.999
What's all that banging about?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.359
Ah. It's up.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.559
Yes, it is.
I wanted it there for tonight.

37:27.560 --> 37:28.959
Of course.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.079
Would you like to come
for a walk before dinner?

37:31.080 --> 37:33.679
- Yes, please.
- No getting dirty.

37:33.680 --> 37:34.759
- You either.
- I won't.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.320
Oh, we'll try.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.679
It means the world.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.679
I know that.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.159
So, who have we got?

37:45.160 --> 37:48.039
Jack and Harry.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.479
Possibly Doris.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.960
Roy?

37:52.240 --> 37:54.400
Well, that would be
biggest blessing.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.079
Bye.
Have a good walk.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.960
Bye.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.999
There's no need
to rush into anything.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.799
I'm off to the city
by the end of the week.

38:41.800 --> 38:42.959
You'll need someone.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.240
- In the short term, yeah...
- Don't.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.279
It makes it worse.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.079
You are looking
for my replacement.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.199
I have suggestions.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.160
- Henry...
- Please don't.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.039
Well, I'll get onto it
tomorrow, then.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.560
Mm.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.920
I'm expected home.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.919
Oh, Dr. Duncan?
A moment.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.119
I thought you'd be with Emma.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.919
Oh, no, she's at my house,
resting,

39:18.920 --> 39:20.399
with her little school friend.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.239
But some advice.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.879
Mrs. Bligh's Jewish affair.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.759
- Shabbat.
- Yes.

39:26.760 --> 39:31.719
It won't oblige me every week,
will it, if I attend?

39:31.720 --> 39:34.919
Well, does going to church once
mean you're stuck with it?

39:34.920 --> 39:36.879
Well, now,
that's a point well made.

39:36.880 --> 39:41.919
But having just seen dear Dawn
to rest, is it seemly?

39:41.920 --> 39:45.279
Sarah was there praying with us.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.719
We should return the favor,
yeah?

39:47.720 --> 39:49.799
I knew I could depend on you.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.119
Thank you, Doctor.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.519
Ah, Mr. Polson.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.559
No doubt you'll be joining
the broadminded set

39:57.560 --> 39:59.999
at Mrs. Bligh's Shabbat?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.319
- That's the term, you know?
- I do.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.559
So I'll see you there, then?

40:03.560 --> 40:06.239
Yep.
Where's Mr. Fox's room?

40:06.240 --> 40:08.600
Oh, in the private room,
of course.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.319
We got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

40:18.320 --> 40:21.559
I'll be staying, helping Roy.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.599
If you need to talk...

40:23.600 --> 40:24.999
Why would I?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.240
With someone
who knows what's what.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.439
Our inclinations don't make us
part of a club.

40:32.440 --> 40:36.120
I... I thought it might help
to be able to talk openly.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.840
With you?

40:43.840 --> 40:44.879
If you change your mind.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.040
I won't.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.879
Any message for James?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.679
They're probably out there
wondering why you'd visit me.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.520
Please leave.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.959
Hello, Mummy.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.799
Hello.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.439
You've had a long sleep.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.359
It was nice.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.440
I'm sure.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.879
Ava's described Melbourne
as the perfect place

41:45.880 --> 41:48.120
to film the end of the world.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.640
Let me see.

41:55.040 --> 41:59.599
- How to win friends.
- She sounds a bit of a monster.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.600
And you're excited
about Hollywood?

42:03.400 --> 42:06.119
I won't be winning any friends.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.240
If you all know
and Henry doesn't.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.079
He should.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.800
Tell him.

42:18.760 --> 42:19.839
Matt?

42:19.840 --> 42:22.120
On the veranda.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.040
You brought this on us.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.560
I'm sorry.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.560
Olivia.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.080
Olivia.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.919
I've let enough men control me.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.920
I'll leave
with Georgie tomorrow.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.840
Olivia!

43:07.480 --> 43:09.240
Bottles!

43:11.560 --> 43:12.799
Threepence!

43:12.800 --> 43:14.119
There's four of them.
That's a shilling.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.999
I'm rich!

43:17.000 --> 43:18.800
Someone's left you a present.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.159
- Need a lift?
- That's good timing.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.319
I'm rich!

43:24.320 --> 43:26.399
You watch Uncle Jack's car.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.759
She's right.

43:28.760 --> 43:30.999
And your trousers.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.960
Your mum won't be too impressed.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.079
Dried mud.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.479
Must have been dropped
the night it rained.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.040
It's a strange place for it.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.279
Now, let's get you cleaned up
before dinner.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.799
Okay.

44:01.800 --> 44:05.160
- How long have I got?
- 20 minutes before sundown.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.960
I'll be back.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.200
Elizabeth.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.359
Elizabeth?

44:49.360 --> 44:51.039
Elizabeth, was I being so dull?

44:51.040 --> 44:53.799
I'm sorry.
You were saying.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.720
What were you thinking?

44:57.800 --> 45:00.879
Sunset.
It's almost time.

45:00.880 --> 45:03.199
Am I wrong to resent it?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.999
If it means you're here
more often,

45:06.000 --> 45:09.199
let Ash Park go to the Jews
or the pack.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.919
- Same thing.
- Prudence.

45:11.920 --> 45:14.079
You're the one avoiding it.

45:14.080 --> 45:16.079
Not from prejudice.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.759
The remark was offensive.

45:18.760 --> 45:22.760
An ill-considered jest.
I apologize.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.480
If not prejudice, what?

45:28.320 --> 45:31.999
I have felt distant
from Ash Park before,

45:32.000 --> 45:35.199
but never alien to it.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.280
With this, I do.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.999
The candle tradition
is from Biblical times,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.360
where women lit a lamp that had
to last through the evening.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.840
Ma'am?

46:28.760 --> 46:30.960
Not too late?

46:32.960 --> 46:36.000
Oh, Mr. Briggs.
Come, come.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.680
We all understood.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.159
You're right on time.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.679
- You've made our evening.
- You have.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.120
Too right.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.679
Goodo, then.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.960
This is for you.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.639
God has smiled on us,
Mrs. Bligh.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.440
He has.

47:34.080 --> 47:35.760
Shabbat shalom.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.399
Shabbat shalom.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.839
Shabbat shalom, Doris.

47:41.840 --> 47:45.359
Oh!
Shabbat shalom.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.360
Shabbat shalom.

47:46.361 --> 47:47.560
Sarah.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.000
Shabbat shalom, David.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.160
I love you.

48:10.200 --> 48:11.280
Coming.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.279
The lady herself.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.440
I hoped you'd have arrived.

48:29.840 --> 48:32.000
Give an old flame a kiss?

48:53.800 --> 48:55.439
Elizabeth.

48:55.440 --> 48:58.639
I bluffed my way past the maid.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.719
What do you want?

48:59.720 --> 49:02.039
Your help.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.480
You're gonna give it.

49:04.305 --> 49:10.436
