WEBVTT

00:06.775 --> 00:07.833
Aunt Betty?

00:10.812 --> 00:11.870
Darn it!

00:11.913 --> 00:13.846
You're finally setting up
a Facebook page?

00:13.881 --> 00:15.075
Everyone at YETI is on it.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.016
I'm trying to get a photo up
before today's class.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.042
Oh, Tina Brown is speaking!

00:20.154 --> 00:21.587
<i>Can you get her to sign
my Diana Chronicles?</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.886
- Yeah.
- Oh! Is that worth something?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.516
Because if we sell it,
maybe we can redecorate.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.685
Some customers came in

00:26.727 --> 00:28.058
and said the place was looking raggedy.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.689
<i>Don't even joke about my DiChron.</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:31.925
And they were talking about Grandpa.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.127
<i>Ay, with the robe and the moping.</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:36.135
You'd think Elena
had been gone for a month.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.832
So I'm a little down. Elena's away.
Let me feel the pain.

00:39.906 --> 00:44.536
<i>Papi, she has been in California
for three days.</i>

00:45.178 --> 00:49.638
I miss her. Finally, I understand
what country music's all about.

00:49.682 --> 00:52.014
Dad, you haven't been in a relationship
in a long time.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.110
You'll have to get used
to the ups and downs again.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.450
Hi, Daniel!

00:57.490 --> 01:01.926
Oh Betty, I'm really sick.
I think I'm dying.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.928
You always think you're dying
when you're sick.

01:03.962 --> 01:09.764
But this time I really am.
I'm all stuffed up. My heart is racing.

01:09.835 --> 01:11.393
Well, do you want me to call a doctor?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.802
Please. It just hurts to dial.

01:13.839 --> 01:16.307
And do you want me to set up a room
at the Amsterdam?

01:16.341 --> 01:20.971
I'm already there.
They brought me cookies.

01:21.013 --> 01:24.710
Daniel likes to check into a fancy hotel
when he's feeling sick.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.740
Okay, I will send the doctor to you.

01:26.784 --> 01:30.049
Daniel, you're going to be okay.
I'll call you from the office.

01:30.087 --> 01:31.111
<i>Thanks, Betty.</i>

01:33.024 --> 01:35.049
Sounds like somebody's a big baby.

01:35.092 --> 01:37.788
He just likes to be taken care of
when he's feeling lousy.

01:37.828 --> 01:39.728
Must be nice to be rich.

01:45.536 --> 01:46.730
Oh, my God, the baby!

01:50.473 --> 01:54.307
Connor! Connor! Connor!

01:58.748 --> 01:59.840
You looked so peaceful,

01:59.883 --> 02:02.919
so I thought I'd bring William in here
and let you sleep in.

02:02.919 --> 02:05.410
Sorry. Maternal instincts.

02:05.455 --> 02:08.753
I suddenly had the urge
to strangle someone to protect him.

02:09.459 --> 02:13.326
Why don't you go back to bed?
I got breakfast from Payard.

02:13.362 --> 02:15.353
What did I do to deserve this?

02:19.301 --> 02:22.464
I wish I could just
live in this moment.

02:23.105 --> 02:27.804
No work, no one else.
Just you and me and the baby.

02:27.843 --> 02:31.040
Or better yet, what if we ran away
somewhere distant and exotic

02:31.080 --> 02:32.377
where no one could find us?

02:32.414 --> 02:34.780
Well, that would be fabulous.

02:34.817 --> 02:38.718
If only those morons we work with
could get anything right,

02:39.487 --> 02:43.719
then we wouldn't have to go
in to work at all.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.056
- Morning, Amanda.
- Betty, wait!

02:53.268 --> 02:54.257
What?

02:54.335 --> 02:57.099
I need to know that you know
what you're wearing.

02:57.138 --> 02:59.868
There you are! We're going
to be late for YETI! Come on.

02:59.907 --> 03:01.066
Marc, we've got like...

03:01.108 --> 03:04.441
Twenty-seven minutes and 15 seconds.
Fourteen, 13...

03:04.478 --> 03:05.877
Chop-chop, slowpoke-ahontas!

03:05.912 --> 03:10.474
I need to be on the street right now
hearing you gasp for breath behind me!

03:10.517 --> 03:11.814
- Molly!
- Oh!

03:11.852 --> 03:15.049
- Hey, did you get your leak fixed?
- Leak?

03:15.088 --> 03:16.919
Your apartment.
Daniel told me that you had a leak.

03:16.957 --> 03:19.391
Oh! Yeah, it's fine. Totally fixed.

03:19.426 --> 03:22.020
Actually, is Daniel in his office?
I sort of need to talk to him.

03:22.095 --> 03:23.687
No, he's out sick.
You know how he gets.

03:23.764 --> 03:24.923
He doesn't really like people
to see him...

03:24.997 --> 03:26.988
He's at the Amsterdam
under the name "Mr. Sickington. "

03:27.066 --> 03:29.864
- Give our love to pasty-face!
- What...

03:32.071 --> 03:35.563
Hey, Marc, Daniel's sick name
is supposed to be a secret.

03:35.608 --> 03:36.632
Oh?

03:36.709 --> 03:39.940
Really? I am not missing Tina Brown.

03:41.347 --> 03:45.443
I'm afraid you're all going to miss
Tina Brown. She had to cancel.

03:47.153 --> 03:48.642
I'll be honest.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.316
Last night there was some drinking.
Some things were said.

03:52.357 --> 03:56.521
Somebody's husband may or may not
have grabbed somebody's boob.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.157
But it's you people who suffer.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.223
Wow, that really sucks.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.631
Tina was going to talk with us

04:03.668 --> 04:06.330
about how the economics
in the business are changing.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.704
So, with that topic in mind,

04:09.741 --> 04:15.906
I have arranged
a special surprise guest.

04:17.348 --> 04:19.815
- Do you know who it is?
- I don't know, but let us pray.

04:19.850 --> 04:22.478
Graydon Carter, David Remnick,
Anna Wintour...

04:22.519 --> 04:24.180
Stanley Mudge!

04:26.757 --> 04:28.190
Who is he? Is he famous?

04:28.258 --> 04:30.317
No. And he's old.

04:30.394 --> 04:35.229
Stanley was the head of Accounting
at Hearst until 1985.

04:35.265 --> 04:40.065
He's here to talk to you about budgets!

04:41.437 --> 04:42.495
Kill me now.

04:49.212 --> 04:54.450
Thank you, Stanley.

04:54.450 --> 04:57.681
You make amortization sexy.

04:58.588 --> 04:59.850
Okay, homework!

04:59.889 --> 05:01.446
I want all of you to get copies

05:01.523 --> 05:04.424
of your magazine's issue budgets
for this year.

05:04.793 --> 05:07.353
I've already e-mailed
each of your bosses and okayed it.

05:07.429 --> 05:09.897
Learn those budgets
backwards and forwards,

05:09.965 --> 05:11.523
because next class,

05:11.566 --> 05:15.229
I want each one of you
to do a presentation on them.

05:16.204 --> 05:18.104
Okay. That's it. Go.

05:19.975 --> 05:21.374
Hey, pretty girl!

05:21.410 --> 05:24.037
So today I don't look
like Dora the Explorer?

05:24.078 --> 05:26.672
Did I say that? That's funny.

05:27.615 --> 05:28.639
What do you want?

05:28.682 --> 05:32.049
Well, I was thinking since we both work
at the same magazine, how about this?

05:32.086 --> 05:37.149
I'll let you do the fun-fun numbers stuff,
while I'll do the heavy lifting

05:37.224 --> 05:41.092
and come up with a colorful hand-out,
put both of our names on it.

05:41.128 --> 05:42.186
What do you think?

05:42.263 --> 05:44.060
Marc, I'm not great at numbers, either,

05:44.098 --> 05:47.465
so why don't we just take this as
an opportunity to help each other?

05:47.501 --> 05:51.095
Fine. But you gotta carry
your own weight, Suarez.

05:53.406 --> 05:57.172
That's it? You're not gonna make
a fat joke? We're progressing!

05:57.210 --> 05:59.474
And it was right there.
Oh, well, next time.

05:59.512 --> 06:01.207
Hey, hey, just happened to overhear

06:01.247 --> 06:02.714
that you are not very good
with numbers,

06:02.749 --> 06:04.683
and I sort of have an MBA.

06:04.717 --> 06:08.016
- Wow, Matt, you have an MBA?
- Also half a law degree.

06:08.087 --> 06:12.182
And I almost became
a large animal vet. It's a long story.

06:12.257 --> 06:14.487
But, anyway, I was thinking
maybe we could go out,

06:14.526 --> 06:16.551
grab a drink and talk budgets.

06:16.628 --> 06:18.653
- Smooth.
- That's so sweet.

06:18.697 --> 06:21.427
You know what? I think we're gonna be
okay on this one. Thank you, though.

06:26.438 --> 06:30.397
- Betty Suarez, you saucy minx.
- What are you talking about?

06:30.442 --> 06:32.376
I'm talking about tall, dork
and handsome back there

06:32.411 --> 06:33.571
asking you out on a date.

06:33.612 --> 06:35.806
No, he was just offering to help us
with our budget homework.

06:35.847 --> 06:37.508
- It wasn't anything.
- Are you serious?

06:37.548 --> 06:40.016
It was like two of those
weird show dogs trying to mate,

06:40.051 --> 06:42.645
and it's all wrong,
like a grayhound and a Chihuahua.

06:42.720 --> 06:46.156
- The poor Chihuahua's...
- Okay, okay! I get the point. Thank you.

06:46.224 --> 06:47.282
So what if it was a date?

06:47.358 --> 06:49.485
"So what if it was a date?"
Well, do you like him?

06:49.527 --> 06:52.291
Well, I don't know. I mean, he's cute,
and he's nice and all...

06:52.330 --> 06:54.890
So give him a shot at love, Tila Tequila!

06:54.932 --> 06:56.160
Yeah, but what if it didn't work out?

06:56.200 --> 06:57.724
Then I'd have to see him,
like, all the time.

06:57.768 --> 06:59.235
Speaking of which,
is it gonna be weird for you

06:59.270 --> 07:01.294
- going down to Accounting?
- No. Why would it be weird?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.034
'Cause that's where Henry,
your former lover, worked!

07:04.074 --> 07:07.100
Okay, ew to the word "lover,"
and you're being ridiculous, Marc.

07:07.143 --> 07:09.771
I'm totally over Henry Grubstick.

07:12.616 --> 07:15.915
Wow, it sure takes a while
to get rid of cubicle nameplates.

07:15.986 --> 07:19.046
Not that it matters to me.
I mean, it's got nothing to do with me.

07:19.122 --> 07:21.590
So, Jenny, let's talk budgets.

07:21.658 --> 07:24.626
Actually, funny you should
bring up Henry's old cubicle.

07:24.693 --> 07:26.593
He was really the best at budgets.

07:26.629 --> 07:28.722
He was, wasn't he?

07:28.764 --> 07:30.925
Yeah, I remember that. So, budgets...

07:30.966 --> 07:34.424
Hey, has anyone heard from
good old budget-making Henry?

07:34.470 --> 07:37.303
Well, yeah, all the time.
He's on Facebook.

07:37.339 --> 07:38.363
He is?

07:38.407 --> 07:41.137
Sorry, you probably remember,
Betty is Henry's ex.

07:41.176 --> 07:42.905
She's a little obsess-y.

07:42.945 --> 07:45.971
- I'm not obsess-y! Is this fun for you?
- A little.

07:46.015 --> 07:49.506
Well, if it helps,
it seems like Henry's really happy.

07:49.584 --> 07:53.418
He posted all these awesome pictures
of him and his girlfriend in Peru.

07:53.454 --> 07:56.890
- Charlie.
- No, I think this girl's named Samantha.

08:00.161 --> 08:03.062
I just can't believe Henry's
already in a serious relationship.

08:03.097 --> 08:06.464
Aunt Betty, you had a crush
on your emo neighbor guy.

08:06.501 --> 08:09.698
I know. I know.
You're right. You're right.

08:11.972 --> 08:15.806
It's just my crush was a crush.
It wasn't a trip to Peru.

08:15.842 --> 08:17.605
People move on.

08:17.644 --> 08:19.839
You're right, Justin. You're right.

08:20.547 --> 08:23.448
Okay, maybe it was a little hard for me
to go down to Accounting,

08:23.483 --> 08:26.384
but, I mean, I haven't even thought
about him in, like, months,

08:26.420 --> 08:29.787
so why this is bothering me,
I don't know.

08:30.390 --> 08:33.791
You know what I do when I can't get
my mind off of something or someone?

08:33.827 --> 08:36.760
- What?
- I channel it into a project.

08:37.663 --> 08:40.722
Hello, you think
I really care about macramé?

08:41.299 --> 08:43.700
Okay, bad example,
'cause I love macramé,

08:43.736 --> 08:47.331
but you get the idea. Try these budgets.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

09:08.426 --> 09:10.394
Are you all right, Betty?
You seem a little jittery.

09:10.428 --> 09:12.692
I just had a little bit of coffee

09:12.731 --> 09:14.699
and an energy drink called Viper Strike.

09:14.733 --> 09:15.825
Have you seen those ads?

09:15.867 --> 09:18.358
"The drink that bites back!
Viper Strike!"

09:19.704 --> 09:21.535
Uh, have you tried tea?

09:21.573 --> 09:24.666
Are you shopping for jewelry?

09:25.776 --> 09:26.868
No!

09:26.910 --> 09:30.812
- Daniel, is that for Molly?
- Maybe.

09:30.848 --> 09:33.510
Wow. That looks kind of serious.

09:33.584 --> 09:35.051
Okay, Betty, I'm dying.

09:35.085 --> 09:38.521
I'm sure you didn't come over here
to talk about jewelry and Viper Strike.

09:38.589 --> 09:39.988
No, no, no. Okay, sorry.

09:40.024 --> 09:43.755
<i>Look, I was up all night looking
at the Mode budgets for YETI</i>

09:43.794 --> 09:45.352
and kind of trying to keep my mind off

09:45.396 --> 09:47.693
Henry and his girlfriend
and Facebook and...

09:47.730 --> 09:49.891
- What are you talking about?
- Never mind. It's a long story.

09:49.932 --> 09:52.628
Anyway, I was trying to add up
the quarterly budgets,

09:52.669 --> 09:54.830
and it kept coming up short.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.398
Like, by millions.

09:58.441 --> 09:59.931
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

09:59.976 --> 10:02.467
We're always moving money
from one magazine to another.

10:02.545 --> 10:05.013
I don't know, Daniel. It's just weird.

10:05.048 --> 10:08.313
Okay, Betty.
My doctor told me to avoid stress.

10:09.052 --> 10:12.885
If you really think there's a problem,
talk to Wilhelmina or Connor.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.411
He's our CFO.

10:14.456 --> 10:17.584
If there are any money problems,
I'm sure he can fix them.

10:18.794 --> 10:21.820
So, you can understand
why I was a little worried.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.696
Absolutely, Betty.
Look, it's Accounting 101.

10:24.733 --> 10:27.861
Corporations always move money
from one division to another,

10:27.903 --> 10:31.430
and Meade is a very large corporation.

10:32.274 --> 10:33.366
Uh...

10:33.709 --> 10:36.438
Okay.
It just seems like a lot of money to...

10:36.510 --> 10:39.308
As amusing as I find this conversation...

10:39.346 --> 10:42.543
Why am I being polite?
It's not amusing. Leave.

10:46.220 --> 10:49.155
Darling, this isn't anything
we should be concerned with, is it?

10:49.190 --> 10:53.456
- Absolutely not. It's nothing.
- We're so lucky to have you.

11:02.635 --> 11:06.696
Yeah, hi. Account number 76467.
Pass code, "Sydney. "

11:08.441 --> 11:12.434
I'm calling about some money transfers
from Meade Publications.

11:15.648 --> 11:19.880
Looks like I might have to make
my next transfer ahead of schedule.

11:35.601 --> 11:37.626
What do you mean
you didn't finish your homework? I did.

11:37.669 --> 11:39.864
And I managed to sneak
into the Soho House

11:39.905 --> 11:41.133
with my friend's membership.

11:41.206 --> 11:44.698
Why? Because Daniel Craig
does not just stalk himself.

11:44.777 --> 11:47.836
Well, I started looking at the budgets,
and then I got distracted.

11:47.912 --> 11:51.279
You got bored, huh? I'm bored.

11:51.315 --> 11:53.681
I know. Let's talk about
who I slept with last night.

11:53.718 --> 11:55.652
You guys will never guess.

11:55.686 --> 11:58.280
- What's up, Amanda?
- Hey.

11:59.357 --> 12:00.381
It was him.

12:00.424 --> 12:02.221
- Mmm. Vanilla.
- I know.

12:02.260 --> 12:05.127
Look, Marc, I really did want
to finish the assignment,

12:05.163 --> 12:06.721
but then I noticed
that there was something

12:06.764 --> 12:08.356
really weird about the numbers.

12:08.399 --> 12:10.559
Really? Something that was overlooked
by all the accountants

12:10.600 --> 12:13.364
whose actual job it is
to find weird things?

12:13.403 --> 12:16.566
Well, I don't know.
It just seemed serious at the time.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.302
And I e-mailed a couple people
at other magazines...

12:19.376 --> 12:21.037
I see where this is going.

12:21.077 --> 12:22.806
Yesterday in Accounting,
I thought it would be funny

12:22.846 --> 12:24.643
to tease Betty about Henry
having a new girlfriend,

12:24.681 --> 12:26.205
but clearly it struck a nerve.

12:26.249 --> 12:28.217
Henry has a new GF? OMG.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.219
No, Amanda, I'm fine.

12:30.253 --> 12:34.279
Look, okay, maybe it surprised me,
but I'm totally...

12:34.323 --> 12:35.984
Over Henry? No.

12:36.025 --> 12:38.493
She got upset that Henry
posted vacation photos

12:38.527 --> 12:40.722
with his girlfriend on Facebook. I know.

12:40.763 --> 12:42.788
Can you talk to me, please?

12:42.832 --> 12:44.026
You know what you need to do?

12:44.066 --> 12:46.899
Take all of your dirty photos of him
and post them yourself.

12:46.936 --> 12:49.496
- I don't have pictures like that.
- Of course you don't.

12:49.572 --> 12:52.666
But, seriously, Betty,
there's an easy remedy.

12:52.741 --> 12:54.140
Just find someone new yourself.

12:54.176 --> 12:55.609
What, you actually think
that would work?

12:55.644 --> 12:57.611
Betty, there is a whole world out there

12:57.679 --> 13:02.742
of goofy, awkward, mumbly guys
just waiting to love you.

13:02.784 --> 13:04.752
Hey, how about
that skinny thing from class

13:04.786 --> 13:07.186
who's trying to have your puppies?

13:07.222 --> 13:08.985
- Call him.
- Yeah.

13:16.764 --> 13:19.494
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Matt. It's Betty.</i>

13:19.534 --> 13:21.933
- Oh, hi, Betty.
- Hi.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.527
How are things?

13:23.604 --> 13:25.902
Good. Great. Good.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.407
I'm still doing
my YETI assignment and...

13:28.442 --> 13:29.602
Betty!

13:29.643 --> 13:32.203
Just wanted to say thanks
for that budget stuff before.

13:32.246 --> 13:35.044
I know it wasn't anything,
but I appreciate your moxie.

13:35.449 --> 13:37.883
Yeah, of course. Glad to help.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.019
- Hello?
- I'm so sorry about that, Matt.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.822
I was just wondering if I could ask you...

13:48.861 --> 13:52.763
Betty, almost forgot.
I need you to sign these for Daniel.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.998
Got it.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.137
- Hello, Betty.
- Do you want to go get a drink?

14:02.174 --> 14:04.574
- Yeah, I would love to...
- Good.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.806
Forgot my pen.

14:11.516 --> 14:14.076
Molly! No, no! I don't want you
to see me like this! I'm just...

14:14.119 --> 14:17.247
I'm miserable,
and I don't want to get you sick.

14:17.289 --> 14:18.847
I have soup.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.122
Okay. All right.

14:27.465 --> 14:30.093
Actually, Daniel,
I was hoping we could talk.

14:30.168 --> 14:32.692
All right, but I'm all stuffed up.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.603
I can barely breathe.
My head is killing me.

14:35.639 --> 14:37.971
- I really think I'm dying.
- You're not dying.

14:38.008 --> 14:41.239
I have this weird rash
that won't go away. It really itches.

14:41.278 --> 14:43.838
Look, I have something serious
to talk to you about.

14:44.949 --> 14:46.974
- It's about us.
- Hang on a second.

14:47.017 --> 14:49.884
I'm sorry. My ear hasn't popped yet.

14:50.821 --> 14:52.755
I just wanted to...

14:57.160 --> 14:58.457
Sorry.

14:59.429 --> 15:01.795
You obviously need to get better,
and I'm not helping,

15:01.831 --> 15:03.458
so I'm just gonna let you rest,

15:03.499 --> 15:07.094
and we can talk about this
some other time. Okay.

15:07.837 --> 15:11.739
Wait, wait... Hey. Thanks for the soup!

15:25.921 --> 15:28.617
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I'm happy.

15:28.657 --> 15:30.249
Why would you ask me such a thing?

15:30.292 --> 15:33.693
Because of what you said yesterday
about living in that moment,

15:33.729 --> 15:35.629
just you, me and the baby.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.194
That was a nice moment.

15:39.267 --> 15:41.360
Well, what if...

15:41.436 --> 15:45.394
What if we went somewhere far away

15:45.473 --> 15:47.907
where we could live that moment
all the time?

15:47.942 --> 15:50.137
Would you consider that?

15:50.177 --> 15:51.872
Absolutely.

15:51.912 --> 15:55.348
As soon as I put the June issue to bed,
we'll go on a long weekend.

15:55.383 --> 15:58.944
- What about London?
- No, Willie. I mean, for real.

15:59.687 --> 16:02.178
What's... What are you talking about?

16:02.223 --> 16:05.454
I've got Gaultier on the line
and he's all in a lather.

16:05.493 --> 16:08.586
- About what?
- Who knows? He's French. He's gay.

16:08.661 --> 16:10.094
Anything could set her off.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.963
- Connor, I got to take this.
- Of course.

16:18.772 --> 16:20.933
All right, stop crying.

16:28.081 --> 16:29.673
No, no, that doesn't sound crazy at all.

16:29.716 --> 16:31.513
Those quarterly budget numbers,
they should add up.

16:31.551 --> 16:33.541
Well, that's good,
'cause that's exactly what I thought.

16:33.585 --> 16:36.520
I e-mailed some buddies at a couple
magazines just to double check.

16:36.555 --> 16:38.682
Well, I bet they'll tell you what I just did.

16:38.724 --> 16:42.387
Hmm. Oh yes, that's right. I forgot.
You have an MBA.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.123
- I do.
- And half a law degree.

16:45.197 --> 16:47.791
- And what's the other one?
- I almost became a vet.

16:47.866 --> 16:49.060
Big animals.

16:49.101 --> 16:50.830
Well, it's nice to see
that you're listening.

16:50.869 --> 16:52.029
I listen.

16:52.071 --> 16:55.507
Okay, okay,
then what's my favorite movie?

16:55.541 --> 16:56.700
Um...

16:57.542 --> 16:59.032
Wait, is that a trick question?

16:59.110 --> 17:01.374
If you would've said something,
I would've remembered.

17:01.412 --> 17:04.040
But if I had to guess, I would say...

17:05.450 --> 17:08.180
<i>- Godfather?
- Okay, that's spooky.</i>

17:08.219 --> 17:11.483
- Did I get it?
- No. You just seemed so excited.

17:12.022 --> 17:16.050
<i>- It's actually WALL-E.
- Hmm. I love WALL-E.</i>

17:16.661 --> 17:19.528
- EVE.
- WALL-E.

17:22.098 --> 17:25.626
E- mail. Someone probably
answering my budget questions.

17:31.708 --> 17:34.677
- So? What did it say?
- Not about budgets.

17:35.479 --> 17:37.709
- Is everything okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.054
Have you ever found out that an ex
is dating someone new?

17:46.088 --> 17:48.886
Oh yeah, that's the worst.

17:48.958 --> 17:51.392
Happened to me
when Angelina started dating Brad.

17:51.427 --> 17:54.362
Yeah, and I got dumped for J-Lo.

17:54.396 --> 17:58.594
Uh no, I'm talking about
Angelina Bromberg and Brad Fletcher.

17:58.801 --> 18:04.740
Oh? Well, I sort of just found out
that this guy I was...

18:06.175 --> 18:10.076
- You don't want to hear about this.
- No, no, please. Tell me.

18:11.846 --> 18:14.906
All right, well, his name is Henry.

18:16.484 --> 18:19.942
And then, to make it worse,
he just tried to friend me!

18:19.988 --> 18:22.923
I don't know
why this bothers me, anyway.

18:22.991 --> 18:24.754
I'm gonna shut up.
I've been talking forever.

18:24.826 --> 18:26.760
I'm not gonna say anything else.

18:27.862 --> 18:29.921
Is it just me,
or is it, like, freezing in here?

18:29.998 --> 18:32.522
Here. Here. Give me your hands.

18:37.571 --> 18:39.664
- Better?
- Mmm-hmm.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.202
Hey, Matt, you know what?
I should probably get going.

18:44.244 --> 18:47.270
It's getting a little late for me.
It's been fun. Thanks a lot.

18:47.314 --> 18:49.578
Uh, uh, wait, Betty,
I have to ask you something.

18:49.616 --> 18:51.948
Matt, I like you, and you're a nice guy,

18:51.985 --> 18:54.647
but we're in class together
and it could get complicated

18:54.688 --> 18:56.120
and I don't even know
what I want right now.

18:56.189 --> 18:57.451
Okay, this is kind of embarrassing,

18:57.523 --> 18:59.320
especially since you just
kind of confessed a lot,

18:59.425 --> 19:02.292
but I sort of forgot my wallet.

19:04.697 --> 19:06.289
Oh!

19:26.618 --> 19:27.778
What?

19:30.222 --> 19:33.658
$ 100,000? Do you know
what we could do with this money?

19:33.725 --> 19:35.989
We're not gonna do anything
with this money.

19:36.027 --> 19:37.517
It was a mistake, Hilda.

19:37.596 --> 19:41.293
I'm just saying. Mama could use
a couple new pairs of shoes,

19:41.333 --> 19:43.425
a new hair dryer, maybe some rings.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.560
Maybe a new nickname
that's not "Mama"?

19:45.603 --> 19:48.003
Mama doesn't like your attitude.

19:48.038 --> 19:50.871
This is crazy. Of course
she has to give back the money.

19:50.908 --> 19:52.341
We don't even know who it belongs to.

19:52.376 --> 19:54.310
Well, the bank told me
it came from Meade,

19:54.345 --> 19:56.040
so I'll just go to work tomorrow,

19:56.080 --> 19:58.014
I'll figure out what happened,
and they'll fix it.

19:58.048 --> 20:02.348
Yeah, and on the way, maybe you stop
at Fifth Avenue a couple of times.

20:02.419 --> 20:04.683
Okay, I'll stop. God.

20:05.189 --> 20:08.817
Well, look on the bright side,
at least it was a memorable date.

20:08.891 --> 20:13.760
Why did you have to say "date"?
Now I'm thinking about Elena again.

20:14.998 --> 20:17.330
Date!
I was supposed to lend him money.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.892
That's why I went to the ATM
in the first place. I forgot to go back.

20:19.936 --> 20:23.064
He asked you for money
and you ditched him?

20:23.106 --> 20:25.267
Sounds like the kind of date
I used to have.

20:25.842 --> 20:29.334
I never should have gone out with him.
Now I have to see him in class.

20:29.379 --> 20:31.005
Well, you know what I always say,

20:31.046 --> 20:33.810
"Don't... You know.
Where you... You know. "

20:33.849 --> 20:35.976
- Elegant, Mom.
- What? I'm just saying!

20:36.051 --> 20:38.679
After Video Store Larry
and the Subway Booth Guy,

20:38.754 --> 20:40.551
- I learned my lesson.
- You're right.

20:40.589 --> 20:43.717
I'm just... I'm gonna apologize
and tell him it was a big mistake.

20:43.759 --> 20:48.423
Voicemail. Hi, Henry, it's Betty.
I mean, Matt! It's Henry.

20:48.664 --> 20:53.761
Uh, Matt! It is Betty.
This isn't starting out so well.

20:55.736 --> 20:59.035
Hey, Betty.
A cute-ish boy is here to see you.

21:00.141 --> 21:03.577
Is he the one you're trying to sleep with
to get over the other one?

21:03.678 --> 21:06.238
- I'm right here.
- I know.

21:09.884 --> 21:14.344
Um, first of all, please don't listen
to anything she says. She's crazy.

21:14.422 --> 21:17.550
And second of all, Matt,
I'm so sorry that I didn't come back.

21:17.591 --> 21:19.114
There was this problem
with my bank account.

21:19.159 --> 21:21.491
It worked out okay, actually.
They started me a tab,

21:21.528 --> 21:24.292
and, you know, I've always wanted
to be a regular at a bar, so...

21:24.331 --> 21:27.425
Look, anyway,
I just came by to say that I'm sorry.

21:27.467 --> 21:28.729
- For what?
- I don't know.

21:28.768 --> 21:30.099
For pushing you to go out with me.

21:30.136 --> 21:32.263
I mean, you're obviously
still hung up on this other guy.

21:32.305 --> 21:34.273
No! I'm not hung up on Henry.

21:34.307 --> 21:36.537
You talked about him
for, like, a half-hour.

21:36.576 --> 21:38.441
Well, that's because you asked me to.

21:38.478 --> 21:40.708
Look, it's over. That's done.

21:40.747 --> 21:42.976
We are both at YETI
and we work in the same business

21:43.048 --> 21:45.016
and that could just get complicated.
It did with Henry.

21:45.084 --> 21:47.450
It might, but it also might be great.

21:47.486 --> 21:48.544
- Matt...
- No, Betty.

21:48.620 --> 21:50.144
Look, okay, my mother and my father.

21:50.222 --> 21:51.917
They got married
when they were pretty young.

21:51.957 --> 21:54.050
They didn't have much in common
except me,

21:54.093 --> 21:57.620
and now they're divorced
and they hate each other.

21:57.663 --> 22:01.064
The way I see it, if two people
work in the same business,

22:01.100 --> 22:03.227
maybe it's because
they share the same passion,

22:03.268 --> 22:04.758
and I think that's a good thing.

22:06.537 --> 22:09.370
If you change your mind,
you can find me at 1 OAK.

22:09.407 --> 22:11.568
Guess I'm a regular now.

22:14.912 --> 22:16.311
<i>This is weird.</i>

22:16.381 --> 22:19.214
I don't know why that money
would have been moved like that.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.411
Well, can't you just check
who authorized it?

22:21.486 --> 22:23.215
Let's see.

22:23.287 --> 22:25.585
Looks like it was...

22:27.325 --> 22:29.316
B. Suarez.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.294
What? No, no, no. I'm B. Suarez

22:32.329 --> 22:34.797
and I can't authorize that sort of thing.

22:34.831 --> 22:38.597
I don't know what to tell you.
Your name's all over this.

22:44.141 --> 22:46.735
So, how was the date? I want details.

22:46.777 --> 22:49.439
And by "details,"
I mean very few details. I just ate.

22:49.513 --> 22:51.538
- Well, it was...
- So, let me get to my real point.

22:51.615 --> 22:53.741
Did you finish our assignment
last night?

22:53.816 --> 22:56.944
No. Marc, something happened
that distracted me.

22:56.986 --> 23:00.149
- Oh, did he touch you?
- No.

23:00.189 --> 23:05.126
Marc, I found $ 100,000
in my bank account.

23:05.161 --> 23:06.526
- I don't know where it came from.
- What?

23:06.562 --> 23:09.429
And Accounting just told me
that I'm the one who authorized it.

23:09.465 --> 23:13.367
I don't understand. I think I could be
in some serious trouble here.

23:13.402 --> 23:14.630
For what earthly reason

23:14.670 --> 23:17.036
would someone put that much money
into your bank account?

23:17.072 --> 23:18.732
I don't know.

23:23.545 --> 23:25.706
Connor, I need to talk to you.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.715
- Something very weird is going on.
- What do you mean?

23:28.750 --> 23:33.119
I mean, someone transferred $ 100,000
into my bank account from Meade.

23:34.956 --> 23:37.390
Well, this is very serious, Betty.

23:37.425 --> 23:39.859
I know. Why would they do that?

23:40.795 --> 23:44.491
Truth is, I heard about the transfer
and I know you authorized it.

23:44.531 --> 23:47.625
- I saw your name.
- No, but I didn't authorize it.

23:47.668 --> 23:49.602
I grew up poor, Betty. I get it.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.694
Your father's sick.

23:50.737 --> 23:52.102
You had to move home
to help with the bills.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.404
No, I'm telling you that I didn't take it.
You have to believe me.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.875
I believe you.

23:56.944 --> 23:59.037
But the people who'll investigate
this sort of thing,

23:59.146 --> 24:02.638
that's just the way they're gonna see it,
I'm afraid.

24:05.251 --> 24:07.685
Did you put the money in there?

24:15.127 --> 24:17.755
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:17.797 --> 24:20.732
I didn't think you were until you said,
"I'm not gonna hurt you. "

24:20.766 --> 24:24.361
See, Betty, the thing is,
I don't see why anyone has to know

24:24.403 --> 24:27.304
about anyone stealing
from the company.

24:30.175 --> 24:32.735
You've been stealing...

24:37.048 --> 24:39.744
You did this because of what I found
in the budgets, didn't you?

24:39.784 --> 24:42.446
You couldn't just drop it, could you?

24:42.487 --> 24:44.921
No, you had to e-mail your friends,
ask them if they thought

24:44.956 --> 24:47.049
what was going on at Meade
seemed suspicious.

24:47.092 --> 24:48.354
How do you know about that?

24:48.393 --> 24:52.193
I know a lot of things.
I've been watching you, Betty Suarez.

24:52.230 --> 24:56.097
Now, the way I see it,
if you keep quiet about this,

24:56.133 --> 24:57.725
well, there's no reason
why anyone should know

24:57.768 --> 24:59.497
about the money in your account, either.

24:59.603 --> 25:02.572
Well, you don't know me very well
if you think I would take your bribe.

25:02.606 --> 25:06.167
But do you remember those papers
I gave you for Daniel to sign?

25:08.045 --> 25:10.411
The transfer to your account
was linked to Daniel as well.

25:10.447 --> 25:14.884
Look, it's very complicated,
but basically you'd both go to jail.

25:14.919 --> 25:16.511
Actually, that's not that complicated.

25:16.554 --> 25:17.645
Well, no one's gonna believe

25:17.687 --> 25:19.450
that Daniel is stealing
from his own company.

25:19.489 --> 25:23.926
Charles Keating? Bernie Madoff?
Daniel certainly wouldn't be the first.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.019
Why are you doing this?

25:28.665 --> 25:30.530
I have my reasons.

25:31.334 --> 25:35.464
And remember, if you're thinking
about telling anyone else,

25:35.538 --> 25:39.736
there are a lot more people
you care about than just Daniel Meade.

25:40.243 --> 25:44.201
And I can ruin any of their lives
with a couple of keystrokes.

25:48.083 --> 25:50.517
I'm glad we could have this chat, Betty.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.737
Oh! You want some privacy, huh?

26:22.249 --> 26:24.513
Wilhelmina,
I have to tell you something.

26:24.552 --> 26:28.487
- It's bad.
- Very bad?

26:29.189 --> 26:33.023
- Does someone need a spanking?
- Willie, I'm serious.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.924
I'm stealing from the company.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.453
- What, is it a joke?
- No, no joke.

26:38.498 --> 26:41.399
I'm taking the money,
I'm leaving the country

26:41.434 --> 26:43.902
and I want you and the baby
to come with me.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.037
Say something.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.776
Well, what am I supposed to say?

26:55.814 --> 26:57.475
Yesterday,
you were gonna take me on a trip.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.575
- Today, you're telling me you're a thief!
- Willie...

26:59.618 --> 27:02.143
Connor, what else
have you lied to me about?

27:02.187 --> 27:05.714
- Okay, look, just let me explain...
- I think you better explain!

27:05.758 --> 27:07.589
All right.

27:07.626 --> 27:11.756
Being nice to the Daniel Meades
of the world has served me well.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.628
But I've had to hide how I really feel.

27:14.667 --> 27:15.998
And how do you really feel?

27:16.068 --> 27:19.867
I hate the selfish son of a bitch,
always have.

27:19.904 --> 27:21.872
I thought I could get over it to work here.

27:21.939 --> 27:23.634
And then he took from me.

27:23.675 --> 27:25.074
What? He took from you?

27:25.109 --> 27:28.169
Are you still hung up on that
kindergarten teacher of yours?

27:28.212 --> 27:30.009
Look, it started with that, yeah.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.811
And that's supposed
to gain my sympathy?

27:31.849 --> 27:35.478
Willie, I don't love her. I hate Daniel.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.047
When I found out about them,
I came up with a plan

27:39.090 --> 27:42.820
to steal everything
from that selfish brat, ruin him.

27:42.859 --> 27:46.727
You're talking about stealing
from Meade. I own half of Meade!

27:46.763 --> 27:49.061
Your baby owns half of Meade.

27:49.132 --> 27:51.600
And what, you think Daniel
wouldn't take that from you

27:51.635 --> 27:53.694
in a second if he could?

27:53.770 --> 27:57.604
You've wanted this company
since the moment you got here.

27:57.641 --> 27:59.268
Now, I'm telling you

27:59.376 --> 28:02.903
that I've found a way
to take all of their money,

28:02.946 --> 28:07.439
and I want to give it to you
because I love you, Wilhelmina.

28:08.050 --> 28:09.415
We have an opportunity here.

28:09.452 --> 28:12.114
We can work for these people
for the rest of our lives,

28:12.154 --> 28:14.782
or we can have a future together.

28:15.958 --> 28:19.325
Just you and me and the baby.

28:22.164 --> 28:24.394
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll come with me.

28:24.467 --> 28:30.268
I've chartered a private jet tonight.
I want you to be on it.

28:39.147 --> 28:43.675
Just promise me you'll consider it,
all right?

28:54.361 --> 28:55.726
We need to talk.

28:57.231 --> 28:59.927
This is crazy. I cannot believe
Connor would do this to us.

28:59.967 --> 29:01.195
Yeah, and if we go to the police,

29:01.235 --> 29:03.726
he's made it so that
we'll both be implicated.

29:03.804 --> 29:06.364
- Yeah, well, we've got to tell someone.
- I don't know, Daniel.

29:06.406 --> 29:09.307
I mean, Connor knew
about the e-mails I had sent.

29:09.343 --> 29:13.302
He sort of threatened my family.
It was all kind of creepy.

29:13.347 --> 29:15.405
No, he's just trying to buy some time.

29:15.448 --> 29:17.473
I'm sure he just wants
to take the money and run.

29:17.517 --> 29:19.917
So, what are you saying?
We should go to the police?

29:19.952 --> 29:22.147
I don't know.
I've never been embezzled from before.

29:22.188 --> 29:23.621
I don't know who we can trust here.

29:23.656 --> 29:27.888
Well, there's people
who deal with this sort of stuff, right?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.690
You know what? I'm too sick to think.

29:30.763 --> 29:34.665
Call my mom. Tell her we got to meet
and come up with a plan.

29:37.837 --> 29:39.326
Willie, you're so mysterious.

29:39.404 --> 29:41.372
"Grab all my things.
Bring them to my apartment.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.033
"Buy yourself a Prada belt. "

29:43.074 --> 29:44.803
I threw that last one in
to see if you were listening.

29:44.843 --> 29:46.435
Yes, yes. Put it down there, please.

29:46.478 --> 29:49.311
And you're not, which means
I can now admit that I bought the belt.

29:51.116 --> 29:54.847
Marc, ever consider
giving everything up?

29:54.886 --> 29:57.446
Every time I step on the scale.

29:59.791 --> 30:01.884
Willie, what's going on?

30:05.129 --> 30:07.097
Connor's robbing the company.

30:07.164 --> 30:08.961
He's leaving the country
and he asked me to go with him.

30:13.537 --> 30:16.028
- You're not joking.
- No, I'm not.

30:16.674 --> 30:19.302
- And I'm considering it.
- You're what?

30:19.343 --> 30:20.469
Marc, I love him.

30:20.511 --> 30:23.446
<i>That may be, Willie,
but seriously, Mode is your life.</i>

30:23.480 --> 30:26.517
- I know.
- Not to mention, there are other people

30:26.517 --> 30:29.314
who have put a lot into your successes.

30:29.352 --> 30:32.981
I have never felt like this with anyone.
I've never had this in my life before.

30:33.022 --> 30:35.582
Then again,
let's not forget about the other people.

30:35.658 --> 30:39.253
What if this is my only chance at love?

30:39.329 --> 30:40.796
Okay,
I'm obviously being too subtle here.

30:40.830 --> 30:43.731
I'm talking about me! Me, Willie!
How could you leave me?

30:43.766 --> 30:48.032
If you had the chance to have
all the money you ever needed,

30:48.071 --> 30:51.733
be with the person you loved
for the rest of your life,

30:51.773 --> 30:53.570
would you do it?

30:56.612 --> 30:58.204
I don't know.

30:59.114 --> 31:04.518
Willie, as your friend,
I don't know what to tell you.

31:10.692 --> 31:12.216
I checked with security.

31:12.294 --> 31:15.490
No one's seen Connor for hours.
Or Wilhelmina.

31:15.529 --> 31:17.292
What, you think she's in on this?

31:17.331 --> 31:20.630
I did see Connor with Wilhelmina
right after he talked to me.

31:20.668 --> 31:22.829
Daniel, are you really surprised?

31:22.870 --> 31:25.703
I don't know. I just thought
she owns half the company, so...

31:25.740 --> 31:28.776
Well, maybe half isn't enough for her.

31:28.776 --> 31:31.370
Let's go into your office.
I've got some more bad news.

31:31.412 --> 31:32.777
- What is it?
- Let's go into your office.

31:32.813 --> 31:34.280
Mom, what?

31:39.953 --> 31:44.754
As of noon today, all of the Meade
accounts have been totally cleared out

31:45.792 --> 31:48.022
and there's nothing left.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.267
What's going on in there, anyway?

32:04.510 --> 32:07.308
It's kind of serious, Amanda.

32:08.981 --> 32:12.849
Oh, my God. Is pink back?

32:12.885 --> 32:15.979
No, wait, no, wait, don't tell me.
I don't think I can handle it.

32:38.509 --> 32:41.103
Is everything gone?

32:41.145 --> 32:42.510
Yes.

32:43.414 --> 32:47.350
I had no idea
she would do something like this.

32:48.286 --> 32:51.482
<i>I thought she loved Mode
more than anything.</i>

32:54.591 --> 32:58.288
- I gave her everything, Betty.
- Marc, where's Wilhelmina?

32:58.795 --> 33:02.754
'Cause if you know where she is,
then we can just stop this.

33:07.471 --> 33:10.440
- You didn't get this from me.
- What is this?

33:10.474 --> 33:14.842
That's where she's meeting Connor.
If you hurry, you can still stop her.

33:33.763 --> 33:37.426
Oh, good God. What do you clowns
think you're doing?

33:37.466 --> 33:39.296
Stopping you, Wilhelmina.

33:39.334 --> 33:43.168
- Where's your baby?
- Oh, she wouldn't bring her baby.

33:43.204 --> 33:44.501
She only needed that child

33:44.539 --> 33:46.473
so she could get her hands
on the Meade fortune.

33:46.508 --> 33:49.409
You're all idiots.
You're gonna ruin everything!

33:54.883 --> 33:56.544
I thought we agreed
not to call the police.

33:56.618 --> 33:57.880
I didn't call them.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.819
I did. You don't know me at all.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.725
<i>We're at the tarmac.</i>

34:08.896 --> 34:11.797
<i>Copy that, Victor 33, sending backup.</i>

34:14.701 --> 34:16.396
Sorry I'm not there, darling.

34:16.437 --> 34:20.168
I thought you might change your mind,
so I took an earlier flight.

34:26.112 --> 34:27.272
Connor, I...

34:29.949 --> 34:32.213
So, you chose your career, huh?

34:33.152 --> 34:34.619
I'm sorry.

34:35.755 --> 34:37.154
So am I.

34:39.225 --> 34:41.556
I wish you'd chosen differently.
I really do.

34:45.164 --> 34:46.960
I still love you.

35:15.426 --> 35:16.825
Coffee?

35:20.998 --> 35:23.899
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

35:23.934 --> 35:26.494
I don't need your sympathy.

35:26.537 --> 35:30.200
No, I know. But you loved him.

35:31.709 --> 35:36.271
He asked me to choose.
Him or my career.

35:41.384 --> 35:44.547
I've spent my entire life
building my career.

35:48.525 --> 35:51.153
In life, you have to make choices.

35:52.562 --> 35:54.587
You can't have it all.

35:55.765 --> 36:00.670
Well, I don't know if I believe that.

36:00.670 --> 36:02.796
You are young, Betty,

36:03.772 --> 36:06.673
but you're a career girl, just like me.

36:09.811 --> 36:11.278
You'll see.

36:24.825 --> 36:28.921
Justin?
Everyone in LA is wearing these.

36:28.963 --> 36:30.863
Open it, open it!

36:31.899 --> 36:34.197
Wow!

36:34.235 --> 36:39.901
I am a big fan of Bryant. He's the best.

36:39.941 --> 36:43.741
- Okay, Hilda, for you.
- Thank you!

36:43.811 --> 36:49.544
A tracksuit? It's perfect.
And I am Juicy.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.312
You are, Mama.

36:53.386 --> 36:56.947
- Elena's back.
- And I brought presents!

36:57.190 --> 37:01.251
Oh. I think I left yours in the kitchen.
Come on.

37:03.663 --> 37:05.062
Here.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.622
I figured a girl who's working all the time

37:06.700 --> 37:08.258
could use a little fun.

37:08.702 --> 37:11.933
Oh, sandals. That's great.
Thank you, Elena.

37:13.472 --> 37:15.702
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

37:16.709 --> 37:17.937
No.

37:18.744 --> 37:20.769
Everything kind of went wrong
at work today.

37:20.846 --> 37:25.442
Like, really wrong,
like, "We might not have jobs" wrong.

37:25.484 --> 37:28.942
Oh, my God, Betty. I'm so sorry.

37:29.521 --> 37:30.783
Yeah.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.948
Hey, Elena, you've worked
most of your life, right?

37:33.993 --> 37:36.052
Yeah. Of course.

37:36.095 --> 37:40.554
So, did you ever feel like
you had to make a choice, like...

37:41.599 --> 37:44.432
Like, work or personal life?

37:44.469 --> 37:47.495
What do you mean,
like, you can only have one?

37:49.407 --> 37:53.468
<i>Nena, if I thought like that,
I would have never met your father.</i>

38:00.884 --> 38:03.045
What did I miss?

38:03.086 --> 38:05.316
Here's... I'll tell you what I missed.
Right here.

38:05.355 --> 38:08.518
<i>- I know. Ay, qué chulo.
- Right here is what I missed.</i>

38:08.558 --> 38:11.288
That's not fair. Give me a hug.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.410
Oh, Molly.

38:32.648 --> 38:35.583
I have had the most awful day.

38:39.488 --> 38:41.251
What's going on?

38:44.427 --> 38:46.224
You all right?

38:46.896 --> 38:51.389
I have something to tell you.
I was going to write you a note.

38:51.433 --> 38:53.401
Is this about what you saw
on my computer?

38:53.435 --> 38:54.527
- The rings?
- Daniel...

38:54.569 --> 38:57.367
Because if you think we're moving
too fast, we can slow down.

38:57.439 --> 38:59.236
- Daniel.
- I just... I wanted to get you something,

38:59.307 --> 39:02.799
you know, to let you know
we have a future together.

39:02.844 --> 39:05.074
Daniel, we don't.

39:05.113 --> 39:07.206
What are you talking about?

39:07.248 --> 39:09.773
We don't have a future
because I don't have one.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.483
I'm sick, Daniel.

39:15.289 --> 39:16.881
It's cancer.

39:18.559 --> 39:21.824
I beat it before,
but it's back and it's worse.

39:22.796 --> 39:26.129
You know, I put Connor through this
a few years ago and it was awful.

39:26.166 --> 39:28.464
- I can't do that to you...
- No, no. Wait, wait.

39:28.502 --> 39:30.470
What are you saying?

39:30.504 --> 39:33.996
I'm going to go stay with my family.
I'm sorry, Daniel.

39:34.074 --> 39:36.371
No, no, you're leaving?
Don't I get a say in this?

39:36.409 --> 39:38.104
- Daniel...
- No! No, no.

39:38.144 --> 39:40.237
I want to be there with you, to help you.

39:40.279 --> 39:44.079
You can't drop this in my lap
and just disappear. That's not fair.

39:44.117 --> 39:45.778
- You don't know what you're asking.
- Please. Molly...

39:45.818 --> 39:47.513
You know, I don't want you to.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.113
Molly, come on. Molly! Wait...

40:23.421 --> 40:29.087
<i>When the whites
of your eyes come through</i>

40:31.128 --> 40:36.589
<i>You'll see something new</i>

40:38.803 --> 40:44.537
<i>With your body and mine raised up</i>

40:46.310 --> 40:52.441
<i>It's good to see you back home</i>

41:28.050 --> 41:34.011
<i>With your body and mine raised up</i>

41:35.389 --> 41:42.261
<i>It's good to see you once more</i>

41:53.074 --> 41:55.975
<i>Turning black tables</i>

41:56.010 --> 41:59.775
<i>And you're turning black tables</i>

41:59.880 --> 42:03.407
<i>And you're making your head blur</i>

42:04.751 --> 42:07.686
<i>Making your head blur</i>

42:08.154 --> 42:11.419
<i>And you're turning black tables</i>

42:11.558 --> 42:15.392
<i>And you're turning black tables</i>

42:15.428 --> 42:19.091
<i>And you're making your head blur</i>

42:20.333 --> 42:23.529
<i>Making your head blur</i>
