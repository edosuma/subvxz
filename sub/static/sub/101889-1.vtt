01:45.497 --> 01:47.165
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

01:47.199 --> 01:49.569
<i>Engine failure.
We are in a spin.</i>

01:51.938 --> 01:54.506
<i>Mission Control,
can you hear me?</i>

01:55.507 --> 01:57.677
<i>Engine failure. Mayday!</i>

02:00.278 --> 02:02.815
<i>We're in a spin!
I can't pull us out of it!</i>

02:04.550 --> 02:06.218
<i>Can anybody read me?</i>

02:09.722 --> 02:12.892
<i>Crew, prepare yourself
for impact!</i>

02:12.925 --> 02:14.627
<i>We're going in hot!</i>

03:09.414 --> 03:10.449
Hmm?

03:17.023 --> 03:18.423
<i>Analyzing.</i>

03:18.457 --> 03:19.792
<i>Oxygen detected.</i>

03:38.310 --> 03:39.746
What?

04:01.333 --> 04:03.335
This is Captain Max Cloud. Over.

04:07.472 --> 04:10.308
Repeat.
This is Captain Max Cloud.

04:10.342 --> 04:11.611
Do you read? Over.

04:11.644 --> 04:13.079
<i>We read you, Max.</i>

04:13.112 --> 04:14.714
<i>You're breaking up,
but we read you.</i>

04:14.747 --> 04:16.380
<i>Thank God you're alive.</i>

04:16.414 --> 04:17.950
<i>The galaxy would be lost
without you.</i>

04:17.983 --> 04:19.719
We jumped into hyperspace

04:19.752 --> 04:21.853
and had a total loss
of all power upon reentry,

04:21.887 --> 04:25.057
but I'm Max Cloud,
and I don't have time for death.

04:25.091 --> 04:27.760
<i>Good news
is we have your location.</i>

04:27.794 --> 04:30.062
- And the bad?
- <i>Your location.</i>

04:30.096 --> 04:32.899
<i>I'm afraid you've come down
on Alpha Zed-3.</i>

04:32.932 --> 04:35.001
Alpha Ze...

04:35.034 --> 04:37.402
Oh, shit.

04:37.435 --> 04:39.105
We've landed on Heinous.

04:39.138 --> 04:41.874
Woah. Uh, Heinous?

04:41.908 --> 04:43.943
Sorry. Why is that a, um,

04:43.976 --> 04:47.379
"I'm afraid you have"
type of situation?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.649
The entire planet of Heinous
is a prison

04:49.682 --> 04:53.786
for the galaxy's most dangerous,
violent, and immoral criminals.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.487
That's far from ideal.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.489
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

04:57.522 --> 05:00.392
<i>Sit tight. A rescue ship
will be with you in six hours.</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:02.762
Okay. Six hours, not a problem.

05:02.795 --> 05:04.630
Let me just sweep
the rest of the ship,

05:04.664 --> 05:06.699
look for other survivors,

05:06.732 --> 05:09.501
and check that the main hull of
the ship has not been breached.

05:15.808 --> 05:17.677
I'm gonna gamble
it may have been.

05:19.745 --> 05:21.013
What's your name, soldier?

05:21.047 --> 05:22.748
Jake, the chef.

05:22.782 --> 05:24.016
Chef?

05:24.050 --> 05:26.152
I have literally
cooked you food

05:26.185 --> 05:27.920
every day for the past...

05:27.954 --> 05:29.487
six months.

05:29.521 --> 05:32.058
Well, Max Cloud
meets many people.

05:32.091 --> 05:35.094
I mean, like three times a day
every day.

05:36.896 --> 05:39.532
Time to move. We need to sweep
the rest of the ship,

05:39.565 --> 05:40.633
look for other survivors.

05:40.666 --> 05:41.901
Do you copy me, soldier?

05:41.934 --> 05:43.636
Yeah. Yeah.

05:43.669 --> 05:46.839
Sweep the ship and, uh,
look for survivors.

05:46.873 --> 05:49.775
I said,
"Do you copy me, soldier?"

05:49.809 --> 05:51.077
I just did...

05:51.110 --> 05:54.013
Oh, right!
Uh, um, yeah, copy that.

06:25.077 --> 06:26.779
Your Greatness, I...

06:26.812 --> 06:30.816
Do not enter
on my personal time, Scavenger.

06:30.850 --> 06:35.021
Revengor, this is
worth the interruption.

06:35.054 --> 06:37.623
How rude.

06:37.657 --> 06:40.960
Unless it is something from
my top 10 list of wanted items,

06:40.993 --> 06:42.662
step off.

06:45.264 --> 06:48.768
You have perked my curiosity.

06:48.801 --> 06:51.671
Surely not top five.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.572
Yes!

06:54.807 --> 06:55.775
No.

06:55.808 --> 06:56.943
No.

06:56.976 --> 06:59.045
The tension is mounting.

06:59.078 --> 07:00.546
No.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.215
Yes.

07:03.249 --> 07:06.518
Ah! Yes!

07:06.552 --> 07:08.988
I knew this day would come.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.491
How exciting.

07:31.677 --> 07:32.845
Hello.

07:32.878 --> 07:34.814
Sarah Noble here,

07:34.847 --> 07:37.683
unofficial
world gaming champion.

07:37.717 --> 07:39.118
How are you doing, Cowboy?

07:39.151 --> 07:41.187
<i>Hey! How you know it was me?</i>

07:41.220 --> 07:44.190
'Cause you're
the only one who ever calls me.

07:45.825 --> 07:47.860
And I can hear you
chewing a hot dog.

07:47.893 --> 07:49.695
<i>From a tin for the win.</i>

07:50.830 --> 07:51.797
<i>So you coming tomorrow?</i>

07:51.831 --> 07:53.532
Ucch. No.

07:53.566 --> 07:55.801
Dad's heading out,
so I have to stay in

07:55.835 --> 07:57.837
and wait for a delivery for him.

07:57.870 --> 08:00.606
<i>So? You can come out for a bit.
He won't know.</i>

08:00.639 --> 08:02.641
I can't.

08:02.675 --> 08:04.543
I'm not allowed, Cowboy.

08:04.577 --> 08:06.212
I promised him
I wouldn't go out.

08:06.245 --> 08:07.680
I gotta go.

08:07.713 --> 08:09.315
<i>Yeah, I know. You gotta go.</i>

08:09.348 --> 08:10.750
<i>Night, Sarah.</i>

08:10.783 --> 08:12.118
Good night, Cowboy.

08:17.656 --> 08:19.191
Sarah!

08:19.225 --> 08:21.794
Make sure you turn
that console off before bed,

08:21.827 --> 08:22.995
or it'll overheat.

08:23.029 --> 08:24.730
I will.

08:24.764 --> 08:26.832
I always do.

08:47.253 --> 08:49.955
Uh, Dad, what did I tell you
about knocking?

08:49.989 --> 08:52.124
Well, I would knock
if I thought I was gonna

08:52.158 --> 08:54.994
catch you doing something other
than playing those damn games.

08:55.027 --> 08:57.096
Oh, but I'm so close
to finishing it, though.

08:57.129 --> 08:59.265
You know what? No, that's it.

08:59.298 --> 09:01.901
I'm banning all video games
this weekend.

09:01.934 --> 09:03.969
Come on, Dad.
Get a grip.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.604
You can't speak to me like that

09:05.638 --> 09:07.173
and expect
to get away with it, Sarah.

09:07.206 --> 09:08.808
Now turn it off.

09:09.942 --> 09:11.077
Now.

09:12.111 --> 09:14.080
No, sure.

09:14.113 --> 09:15.147
You got it.

09:17.183 --> 09:18.884
You know, your mother

09:18.918 --> 09:20.753
hated you being
on that thing all the time.

09:20.786 --> 09:22.354
Jeez.

09:22.388 --> 09:24.857
You have serious issues, man.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.626
Watch it with that back talk,
young lady.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.705
Huh. What's this?

09:41.674 --> 09:43.109
No way.

09:43.142 --> 09:45.111
Secret room?

09:46.212 --> 09:48.180
How have I never
seen this before?

09:58.858 --> 10:01.727
I'm the Space Witch.
I know all.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.331
I know everything about you,
your every desire.

10:05.364 --> 10:07.967
I'm sorry.
Did you just say, "Space Witch"?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.703
Yeah, Space Witch.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.738
But you're a...

10:12.771 --> 10:16.308
Well, I mean,
you look like a man.

10:16.342 --> 10:17.977
So?

10:18.010 --> 10:19.445
Well, wouldn't that
make you a space wizard?

10:19.478 --> 10:22.047
Woah! How dare you?

10:22.081 --> 10:24.850
Men can be witches as well,
I'll have you know.

10:24.884 --> 10:26.685
Nonsense!

10:26.719 --> 10:29.455
A man could be a witch
as much as a woman could...

10:29.488 --> 10:31.357
captain a ship.

10:31.390 --> 10:34.026
Yeah, well...

10:34.059 --> 10:35.127
I'm trying to help you,
Max Cloud.

10:35.161 --> 10:36.996
Don't be a douche bag.

10:37.029 --> 10:43.202
Max Cloud does not need help
from weird man witches.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.205
That's actually quite hurtful.

10:47.973 --> 10:50.843
No, Max, maybe we do.

10:50.876 --> 10:52.211
Sarah, who are you...

10:53.312 --> 10:57.716
Sarah, what did I just tell you?

10:57.750 --> 10:59.385
You know, if you're
gonna behave like a child,

10:59.418 --> 11:01.253
then I'm gonna have
to treat you like a child.

11:02.421 --> 11:04.390
No, Dad, don't turn it off.

11:04.423 --> 11:06.425
Okay, I think
I just found an Easter egg.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.827
This might be the last time
I find this place.

11:08.861 --> 11:10.362
Dad, please.

11:12.898 --> 11:14.867
I'm confiscating
your controller.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.102
<i>You'll get it back when you
learn to have a little respect.</i>

11:17.136 --> 11:18.204
<i>No! Don't!</i>

11:18.237 --> 11:19.838
<i>What am I meant to do?</i>

11:20.839 --> 11:22.007
<i>Don't! You're just...</i>

11:22.041 --> 11:24.410
<i>You're just being mean.</i>

11:28.414 --> 11:31.050
So unfair.

11:32.885 --> 11:34.753
<i>I wish I could just play
video games all day,</i>

11:34.787 --> 11:37.723
<i>every day, and no one
could ever stop me.</i>

12:01.548 --> 12:03.382
Sarah...

12:03.415 --> 12:04.817
see you later.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.318
There's a pizza in the freezer.

12:06.352 --> 12:07.987
I won't be back 'til late.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.421
Call me if you need anything.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.926
Okay, I'm going.

12:17.997 --> 12:20.199
Yo!

12:20.232 --> 12:22.468
There's a package
at the back door!

12:22.501 --> 12:24.236
Want me to bring it up?

12:27.306 --> 12:30.442
Fear is not near. Cowboy is...

12:30.476 --> 12:31.510
here.

12:33.946 --> 12:35.080
Sarah!

12:36.448 --> 12:37.483
Ser!

12:39.485 --> 12:40.886
Where you at?

12:45.324 --> 12:46.992
Huh.

12:53.899 --> 12:54.933
Okay.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.978
Jake?

13:06.011 --> 13:09.214
Who plays as Jake?

13:09.248 --> 13:11.817
I didn't even know
you could switch characters.

13:12.585 --> 13:14.920
This is a dark moment.

13:19.559 --> 13:20.893
All right.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.861
Jake, the useless chef, it is.

13:37.376 --> 13:39.912
Where did that Space Wizard go?

13:43.148 --> 13:44.383
Behind me.

13:44.416 --> 13:46.952
Max Cloud always leads the way.

13:46.985 --> 13:48.253
Max Cloud?

13:48.287 --> 13:49.955
What the...

13:49.988 --> 13:52.324
Hell, you... you are Max Cloud,
aren't you?

13:53.292 --> 13:54.393
Is this real?

13:54.426 --> 13:56.028
Yes, I'm real.

13:56.061 --> 13:58.430
I am Max Cloud,
intergalactic space hero

13:58.464 --> 14:00.232
and captain of this ship,

14:00.265 --> 14:03.135
and you are someone
who makes food or something.

14:03.168 --> 14:05.471
What is wrong with you, soldier?
We've already done this.

14:05.504 --> 14:08.040
I c-can't believe I'm standing
in front of Max Cloud.

14:08.073 --> 14:11.009
I must be dreaming.
C-Can I touch you?

14:12.511 --> 14:15.347
Stand down, soldier,
immediately.

14:15.381 --> 14:17.182
Okay.

14:17.216 --> 14:18.685
All right, this is a dream.

14:18.718 --> 14:21.253
This has to be a dream.
I mean...

14:21.286 --> 14:24.189
it feels real.

14:24.223 --> 14:25.491
I mean, you feel...

14:28.327 --> 14:29.294
Huh?

14:29.328 --> 14:31.664
And I feel...

14:37.169 --> 14:38.937
Pull yourself together, soldier!

14:38.971 --> 14:40.305
We don't have time for this!

14:42.508 --> 14:44.209
Okay.

14:44.243 --> 14:47.312
Okay. Whatever the hell
is going on here...

14:48.280 --> 14:50.617
I'm in a spaceship...

14:50.650 --> 14:52.084
with Max Cloud.

14:54.754 --> 14:57.557
That is insanely cool.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.258
<i>Cowboy?</i>

14:59.291 --> 15:01.293
Holy smokes!

15:01.326 --> 15:03.228
<i>Cowboy, i-is that you?</i>

15:04.229 --> 15:05.964
How are you doing that?

15:05.998 --> 15:08.601
Uh, let me pause this.

15:11.069 --> 15:12.739
Weird.

15:12.772 --> 15:14.707
Game won't pause.

15:14.741 --> 15:17.409
See, this is what I'm telling
you about secondhand games,

15:17.443 --> 15:19.178
super sketchy.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.714
<i>This one is definitely sketchy.
That's for sure.</i>

15:23.650 --> 15:26.084
- I'll just restart it.
- <i>No!</i>

15:26.118 --> 15:28.320
Okay.

15:28.353 --> 15:30.456
I mean,
you're not even that far in.

15:30.489 --> 15:32.324
<i>You have to promise me</i>

15:32.357 --> 15:35.227
<i>you won't restart the game
or hit the power.</i>

15:35.260 --> 15:37.062
- Okay.
- <i>Promise me.</i>

15:38.030 --> 15:40.733
Yeah, I promise.

15:42.468 --> 15:44.136
What is going on?

15:44.169 --> 15:46.371
<i>Don't freak out.</i>

15:46.405 --> 15:49.074
I am a paragon of chill,
all right?

15:49.107 --> 15:51.544
<i>I'm just gonna
come straight out with it.</i>

15:51.578 --> 15:53.445
<i>I'm pretty sure
I'm in the game.</i>

15:55.180 --> 15:57.115
Uh, good one.

15:57.149 --> 15:59.518
Now come on. Come out.
Where are you?

15:59.552 --> 16:03.055
<i>In the game. I can see
Max Cloud in the flesh.</i>

16:03.088 --> 16:05.157
<i>He's standing
right in front of me.</i>

16:06.325 --> 16:09.529
Sarah, this is
a really weird joke.

16:09.562 --> 16:11.531
I'm looking at a screen
right now,

16:11.564 --> 16:16.134
and all I can see is Max Cloud
and Jake, nobody else.

16:16.168 --> 16:18.538
<i>What?! Oh, God, I knew it.</i>

16:18.571 --> 16:20.339
<i>I'm Jake, aren't I?</i>

16:20.372 --> 16:22.241
<i>Oh, why couldn't I
have turned into Max?</i>

16:22.274 --> 16:25.177
<i>Seriously?
Jake's literally the worst.</i>

16:26.746 --> 16:28.581
I've seen <i>Big.</i>

16:28.615 --> 16:31.316
I've seen Fred Savage's
magnificent <i>Vice Versa,</i>

16:31.350 --> 16:33.385
so I know these things
are possible.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.187
<i>Help me, Cowboy.</i>

16:35.220 --> 16:37.122
<i>I went to bed,
and the next thing I know,</i>

16:37.155 --> 16:39.391
<i>I'm here
on Max Cloud's spaceship.</i>

16:39.424 --> 16:42.094
This...

16:42.127 --> 16:44.296
this... this is so cool!

16:45.264 --> 16:48.635
Look, if... if you're Jake

16:48.668 --> 16:51.136
and I'm playing as Jake,

16:51.169 --> 16:53.673
does that mean
I'm controlling you?

16:53.706 --> 16:56.174
<i>Uh, I guess so.</i>

17:00.312 --> 17:03.081
Aw, man, this is so awesome.

17:08.387 --> 17:10.122
What's the danger, soldier?

17:10.155 --> 17:11.691
You doing it?

17:11.723 --> 17:14.425
<i>Yes, I'm doing it. Now stop.</i>

17:24.671 --> 17:26.539
But it's so funny.

17:26.573 --> 17:30.108
<i>Y-you're making me
look stupid in front of Max.</i>

17:32.311 --> 17:34.146
Okay.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.447
Party pooper.

17:38.551 --> 17:40.252
Heh.

17:42.454 --> 17:44.122
Must be something
in the atmosphere, sir.

17:44.156 --> 17:45.825
Y-you need to watch out
for that.

17:47.527 --> 17:50.128
I need to watch out for that?

17:50.162 --> 17:52.230
You need to watch out.

17:57.402 --> 17:59.539
What if I can't get out?

17:59.572 --> 18:02.140
<i>I didn't think of that.
What do we do?</i>

18:06.846 --> 18:09.314
Okay, Sarah, keep it together.

18:09.348 --> 18:11.450
You know this game.

18:11.483 --> 18:13.151
Figure this shit out.

18:14.453 --> 18:16.321
The Space Witch.

18:16.355 --> 18:17.489
<i>Space Witch?</i>

18:18.891 --> 18:21.159
<i>Okay, Cowboy,
there's a Space Witch</i>

18:21.193 --> 18:23.195
<i>hidden somewhere on Max's ship.</i>

18:23.228 --> 18:24.797
- <i>We need to find him.</i>
- Him?

18:24.831 --> 18:26.799
<i>I think he might be
my way out of here.</i>

18:26.833 --> 18:29.769
- Okay. How do we do that?
- <i>Well, I don't know, Cowboy.</i>

18:29.802 --> 18:31.904
<i>I'm currently stuck
inside a video game.</i>

18:31.938 --> 18:34.506
- <i>Can you get some help?</i>
- I can't leave, Sarah.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.943
The game won't pause,
and you only have one life left.

18:36.976 --> 18:39.277
<i>Then we only have
one option right now.</i>

18:39.311 --> 18:41.648
<i>You have to play.</i>

18:41.681 --> 18:44.550
Okay. That's no pressure, then.

18:44.584 --> 18:45.885
I'm gonna need some nutrition.

18:55.862 --> 18:58.196
Okay. You got this, buddy.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.833
<i>Cowboy, concentrate.</i>

19:00.867 --> 19:03.268
<i>And don't talk
with your mouth full.</i>

19:05.004 --> 19:05.972
What was that?

19:06.005 --> 19:07.907
Uh, wait.

19:07.940 --> 19:11.410
Um, before you go
all hunter-killer mode,

19:11.443 --> 19:12.912
you might not want
to go in there.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.547
We left the deck seconds ago.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.314
- It's empty.
- Ah!

19:16.348 --> 19:19.284
But there's a hole in the deck,
big hole.

19:19.317 --> 19:20.820
Well, if there is
something in there,

19:20.853 --> 19:22.521
it's not gonna be very friendly,

19:22.555 --> 19:24.657
so whatever's on
the other side of those doors,

19:24.691 --> 19:26.826
we kill. Is that understood?

19:27.794 --> 19:28.761
"We"?

19:28.795 --> 19:29.829
Yeah.

19:44.677 --> 19:46.478
Okay, concentrate, Cowboy.

19:46.511 --> 19:47.814
Okay, then.

19:47.847 --> 19:50.583
Who wants the first dance?

20:10.737 --> 20:12.471
<i>Finish him.</i>

20:14.841 --> 20:17.009
<i>K.O.!</i>

20:18.044 --> 20:19.912
<i>Round one. Fight!</i>

20:25.952 --> 20:27.720
- <i>Perfect.</i>
- Ho!

20:27.754 --> 20:29.287
<i>K.O.</i>

20:38.898 --> 20:39.866
Hah!

20:39.899 --> 20:41.968
Fear is not near.

20:42.001 --> 20:44.670
Max Cloud is here.

20:45.905 --> 20:46.906
Not bad.

20:46.939 --> 20:48.775
Not bad at all.

20:48.808 --> 20:50.977
That guy's head came
completely off his shoulders.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.512
Now all we need to do

20:53.546 --> 20:55.848
is figure out a way
to block that hole.

20:55.882 --> 20:58.017
Uh, we need to get
the plasma-gun thing,

20:58.050 --> 21:00.385
and then we sling them up there,
and then we fire.

21:00.418 --> 21:02.622
I have a plan. Take this.

21:03.723 --> 21:05.390
On my cue...

21:05.423 --> 21:06.726
Uh, Cowboy...

21:06.759 --> 21:07.994
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

21:08.961 --> 21:09.929
Okay.

21:09.962 --> 21:11.531
Ready?

21:11.564 --> 21:14.299
3, 2, 1...

21:24.010 --> 21:25.077
Let's move.

21:30.149 --> 21:31.884
You excited to meet my girl?

21:31.918 --> 21:33.753
My English rose?

21:33.786 --> 21:34.954
<i>In your dreams.</i>

21:34.987 --> 21:36.923
Just tell her Cowboy says hi.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.027
She'll know what it means.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.662
I'd be pretty concerned

21:42.695 --> 21:44.462
if she didn't know
what "Hi" means, Cowboy.

21:46.398 --> 21:48.067
Identify yourself.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.569
I said, "Identify..."

21:49.602 --> 21:51.103
Commander Rexy.

21:51.137 --> 21:52.872
I'm gonna need
visual confirmation on that.

21:52.905 --> 21:54.807
- It's me, Max.
- Who?

21:54.841 --> 21:56.474
Who are you?

21:56.508 --> 21:58.410
Max, I know you know it's me.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.580
How do you know
that I know it's you?

22:00.613 --> 22:02.882
Ah, Commander Rexy.

22:02.915 --> 22:04.382
Captain,
thank goodness I found you.

22:04.416 --> 22:06.018
The galaxy depends on you.

22:06.052 --> 22:07.820
You're the only space hero
who can save this ship.

22:07.854 --> 22:09.155
We'd be doomed without you.

22:09.188 --> 22:10.723
Tell me what happened,
Commander.

22:10.756 --> 22:12.758
Where's the rest of my crew?

22:12.792 --> 22:14.060
Dead.

22:14.093 --> 22:15.460
Fully dead.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.164
Mission report, Commander.

22:18.197 --> 22:20.099
You're so annoying.

22:20.132 --> 22:24.136
Rexy's kinda different here.
She's... she's sassy.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.839
You're just saying that
'cause you're jealous.

22:26.873 --> 22:28.040
What happened, Commander?

22:28.074 --> 22:30.042
Well, the last thing I remember

22:30.076 --> 22:32.578
was jumping into hyperspace.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.981
When I came to,
the ship was torn apart,

22:35.014 --> 22:36.649
and I was floating.

22:36.682 --> 22:39.185
- Floating where?
- In space.

22:39.218 --> 22:41.721
I pulled myself back on board,
and here I am.

22:41.754 --> 22:43.189
- Ah.
- We're the only survivors.

22:43.222 --> 22:45.958
Everyone else is dead.

22:45.992 --> 22:48.127
Hmm. Yeah, that's basically it.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.630
The worst place we
could have ended up is Heinous.

22:50.663 --> 22:52.632
Well, we might
have to get used to it, Max.

22:52.665 --> 22:53.766
Nonsense!

22:58.905 --> 23:02.074
Max Cloud
will not get used to Heinous.

23:04.877 --> 23:07.580
They're coming. Get ready.

23:09.115 --> 23:12.151
Well, we don't have to run
into every situation head-on.

23:12.184 --> 23:13.719
'Course we do. That's the...

23:13.753 --> 23:15.888
- Max Cloud...
- Max Cloud way! Yay!

23:15.922 --> 23:18.224
I have a different idea.

23:18.257 --> 23:20.492
Since when did you
start piping up?

23:20.525 --> 23:21.761
- Follow me.
- Soldier!

23:23.229 --> 23:24.196
Hyah!

23:34.974 --> 23:39.477
Okay, Sarah.
Let me take you somewhere safe.

23:41.614 --> 23:42.815
Max Cloud's bedroom.

23:43.916 --> 23:45.450
Well, it's kinda safe.

23:50.556 --> 23:52.758
It looks like securing
the ship's out of the question.

23:52.792 --> 23:54.694
Have you lost your mind,
soldier?

23:54.727 --> 23:58.130
I will kill
each and every one of them.

23:58.164 --> 23:59.865
I respect you. In fact,

23:59.899 --> 24:02.034
- I admire you, but...
- Well, most people do.

24:02.068 --> 24:04.270
I think...

24:04.303 --> 24:06.272
we need to be sensible
about this.

24:06.305 --> 24:09.542
If we can move forward without
a battle at every corner,

24:09.575 --> 24:10.876
then that would be great,

24:10.910 --> 24:12.878
because I don't want
to die here.

24:12.912 --> 24:16.916
To die on Max Cloud's ship would
be an honorable death, soldier.

24:16.949 --> 24:18.651
- I've got a plan.
- Hmm.

24:18.684 --> 24:20.686
- Why don't we...
- Hmm.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.655
just sit here and do nothing?

24:22.688 --> 24:24.023
Hmm.

24:24.056 --> 24:25.624
We could
put our feet up...

24:25.658 --> 24:27.226
- Hmm.
- watch a video.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.295
- Hmm.
- We deserve it.

24:29.328 --> 24:30.563
Hmm.

24:31.964 --> 24:33.132
Hogwash!

24:33.165 --> 24:35.935
Commander, chef, on me.

24:38.037 --> 24:41.574
Come get some,
intergalactic space scum!

24:41.607 --> 24:42.908
Max!

24:45.244 --> 24:46.645
He'll be fine.

24:46.679 --> 24:48.247
We gotta help him.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.082
If he dies, we die.

24:52.918 --> 24:53.919
Okay!

24:55.087 --> 24:56.989
<i>We can do this.</i>

24:57.023 --> 24:58.190
<i>You ready, Cowboy?</i>

24:58.224 --> 24:59.692
Sarah, this part
always kills me,

24:59.725 --> 25:01.193
even when I'm playing as Max.

25:01.227 --> 25:02.995
<i>Keep it together.</i>

25:03.029 --> 25:06.065
<i>Listen to my voice,
and do exactly as I say.</i>

25:06.098 --> 25:07.133
Okay.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.274
Hey.

25:17.076 --> 25:19.245
<i>Down, A, B, B.</i>

25:25.618 --> 25:26.786
Good work, soldier.

25:26.819 --> 25:27.987
Let's move.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.222
Yahoo!

25:30.256 --> 25:32.758
<i>Stay focused, Cowboy.</i>

25:32.792 --> 25:34.326
We are killing it!

25:34.360 --> 25:36.228
I've never played this well
before in my life.

26:47.366 --> 26:49.135
I'm sick and tired...

26:49.168 --> 26:51.337
of you Heinous scum!

27:00.379 --> 27:02.081
It's a dead end.

27:02.114 --> 27:05.251
I scared them off
with an act of pure violence.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.721
Well,
what about those guys?

27:08.754 --> 27:11.157
Fall back!

27:12.925 --> 27:14.426
Follow me, soldiers!

27:14.460 --> 27:16.962
The whole planet's gone to shit!

27:27.306 --> 27:29.341
No way.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.110
Is it really...

27:31.143 --> 27:33.379
Brock Donnelly,
intergalactic bounty hunter?

27:57.503 --> 28:00.739
Give me a damn good
reason not to kill you.

28:06.045 --> 28:07.479
<i>Can you see this, Cowboy?</i>

28:07.513 --> 28:10.249
Yeah. We're lucky
he hasn't killed you, too.

28:10.282 --> 28:12.418
Oh, my God,
it's the Brock Donnelly.

28:13.852 --> 28:15.354
Keep your shit together!

28:15.387 --> 28:17.156
<i>Stop fangirling, Sarah.</i>

28:17.189 --> 28:18.324
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

28:18.357 --> 28:19.458
Hello, dear.

28:20.459 --> 28:21.760
Brock Donnelly.

28:21.794 --> 28:22.962
I know. I'm Sar...

28:22.995 --> 28:24.930
I'm Jake! I'm Jake.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.098
I'm Jake.

28:29.536 --> 28:31.003
He always like that?

28:31.036 --> 28:33.239
No, not normally.

28:35.341 --> 28:36.942
Works for me.

28:38.177 --> 28:40.412
Ugh. Gross.

28:40.446 --> 28:42.448
You know, Brock's my guy,

28:42.481 --> 28:46.318
but if he even thinks about
trying anything with Rexy,

28:46.352 --> 28:47.753
oh, man.

28:53.192 --> 28:54.994
Inside. Hurry up.

28:55.027 --> 28:58.230
Don't even think about it.
That's Max Cloud's seat.

28:59.932 --> 29:01.534
What are you doing
on my ship, prisoner?

29:01.568 --> 29:03.202
Tell him, Brock.

29:03.235 --> 29:05.572
- Tell him about the ship.
- Okay.

29:05.605 --> 29:09.341
As soon as space clown here
puts his gun down.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.909
No?

29:15.582 --> 29:17.283
Suit yourself, spandex.

29:29.094 --> 29:32.264
I came here tracking a bounty...

29:32.298 --> 29:33.966
Shee.

29:36.435 --> 29:37.970
Look at her.

29:38.003 --> 29:41.040
What a piece of work, eh?

29:41.073 --> 29:44.544
Wanted on over
12 different planets.

29:46.345 --> 29:49.014
I finally tracked her
here to Heinous.

29:50.550 --> 29:54.286
Perfect place for a criminal
to disappear, right?

29:54.320 --> 29:57.456
I was tracking her
through the mountains.

29:57.489 --> 29:59.391
I knew she was close.

30:01.327 --> 30:04.463
I could almost smell
the evil in the air,

30:04.496 --> 30:06.398
I mean, taste it.

30:06.432 --> 30:08.535
Then I look up into the sky,

30:08.568 --> 30:11.638
and I see the ship,
and I think, "That's weird.

30:11.671 --> 30:13.472
That looks like my ship."

30:14.506 --> 30:17.142
- I realize...
- It was his ship.

30:17.176 --> 30:19.311
It was my ship.

30:19.345 --> 30:22.514
So now I find myself here...

30:24.249 --> 30:25.951
helping you guys.

30:25.984 --> 30:29.021
And I'm prepared
to give up a 35-year record

30:29.054 --> 30:34.226
of never losing a bounty
to get off this rock, Heinous.

30:34.259 --> 30:38.163
So you gonna lower that gun?

30:39.365 --> 30:41.500
'Cause I'm
the only help you got.

30:43.202 --> 30:44.671
You have a lot more
to worry about

30:44.704 --> 30:47.272
than some old space cowboy.

30:47.306 --> 30:48.974
Max Cloud, lower that gun.

30:49.007 --> 30:51.043
We do not have time
for your peacocking.

30:51.076 --> 30:56.215
Okay, let's get
this tin can in the sky.

30:58.450 --> 31:00.919
I will have you know
that this tin can

31:00.953 --> 31:02.655
is the fastest ship
in the galaxy.

31:02.689 --> 31:05.924
Now just you remember
who you're talking to.

31:05.958 --> 31:09.629
I have absolutely no idea
who the hell you are.

31:09.662 --> 31:11.964
But I do know one thing.

31:11.997 --> 31:15.200
If you don't listen to me,
you're gonna be turned into

31:15.234 --> 31:18.070
pink larvunian lasagna
in the next few hours.

31:18.103 --> 31:20.439
I can handle
those degenerates out there.

31:20.472 --> 31:22.074
Don't you worry about that.

31:23.041 --> 31:24.611
Oh, listen, sunshine.

31:24.644 --> 31:27.446
It ain't the pansies out there
that worry me.

31:27.479 --> 31:28.514
Oh, no.

31:30.717 --> 31:33.018
You see
them two sisters up there?

31:35.220 --> 31:37.022
That's what concerns me.

31:38.457 --> 31:42.595
They remind me of these twins
I knew once on Voltor-7.

31:42.629 --> 31:44.697
Crazy beautiful,

31:44.731 --> 31:48.300
make the hairs on the back
of your neck stand up...

31:48.333 --> 31:51.470
until you felt a knife
right up in your balls.

31:51.503 --> 31:53.038
Lovely.

31:53.071 --> 31:55.240
Get to the point, convict.

31:55.274 --> 31:58.477
Point is these two stars...

32:00.312 --> 32:02.615
every 24 hours,
circle this planet,

32:02.649 --> 32:05.150
and they burn as hot
as the Earth's sun,

32:05.184 --> 32:08.020
so everything on the surface
of this planet

32:08.053 --> 32:09.656
is turned into space liquid.

32:09.689 --> 32:12.692
That's why the prisoners
live underground.

32:15.728 --> 32:17.496
So how long do we have?

32:17.530 --> 32:20.199
- Eh, my best guess...
- Eight hours, 20 minutes.

32:20.232 --> 32:21.701
Exactly.

32:21.734 --> 32:24.102
What? Oh.
Uh, it was my best guess, too.

32:26.539 --> 32:28.307
Easy, cupcake.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.577
Your nerve
will steady with age.

32:33.111 --> 32:36.081
Why are these shutters
not working?

32:36.114 --> 32:38.383
They're not gonna
get through them doors.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.753
They don't want
to destroy the ship.

32:59.739 --> 33:04.176
This is not good
for my anxiety.

33:04.209 --> 33:07.045
Why play it then,
My Magnificence?

33:26.566 --> 33:28.267
I lose my focus,

33:28.300 --> 33:31.638
and when I lose my focus,
I lose my temper!

33:39.511 --> 33:43.583
Shee, tell me about the ship.

33:43.616 --> 33:46.653
Or I should say "my new ship."

33:46.686 --> 33:49.421
Our new ship.

33:49.454 --> 33:51.858
Yes.

33:51.891 --> 33:53.626
Our new ship.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.728
That's more like it.

33:55.762 --> 33:59.566
The main part of the ship
was destroyed in the crash.

33:59.599 --> 34:02.134
What?!

34:02.167 --> 34:05.337
Remember who you
are speaking to.

34:05.370 --> 34:08.541
Remember what I did for you,
Your Greatness.

34:08.574 --> 34:11.443
Okay.

34:11.476 --> 34:12.645
I'm sorry.

34:12.679 --> 34:16.583
I'm just under a ton of stress.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.820
The control vessel
is still intact,

34:20.853 --> 34:23.455
so it will fly.

34:23.487 --> 34:26.358
Our time has come.

34:26.391 --> 34:31.764
Oh, so I will have my revenge.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.737
Shee, is this Max Cloud

34:37.770 --> 34:41.273
as handsome as they say he is?

34:45.911 --> 34:48.081
Sarah, can you hear me?

34:49.313 --> 34:51.483
Sarah, can you hear me?!
Are you there?!

34:51.516 --> 34:53.719
Stop shouting!

34:53.753 --> 34:56.521
Literally
no one was shouting.

34:56.556 --> 34:58.190
<i>I was freaking out, dude.</i>

34:58.223 --> 34:59.692
<i>I was speaking,
but I couldn't hear you.</i>

34:59.726 --> 35:01.226
<i>C-could you hear me?</i>

35:01.259 --> 35:02.862
<i>I was shouting your name.</i>

35:02.895 --> 35:06.532
No, I only just heard you
just now shouting in my ear.

35:06.566 --> 35:08.233
Thanks for that.

35:08.266 --> 35:09.936
Commander, was the power room
still intact

35:09.969 --> 35:11.638
when we lost
the rest of the ship?

35:11.671 --> 35:13.472
- Yes.
- Hmm.

35:13.505 --> 35:15.575
Now please won't one
of you masculine space heroes

35:15.608 --> 35:17.543
share your plan with the group?

35:17.577 --> 35:20.913
We get the power core,
we stick it in here,

35:20.947 --> 35:23.783
and we get the hell
out of Dodge.

35:23.816 --> 35:26.184
Surprisingly,
I agree with the pirate.

35:26.218 --> 35:28.353
Get used to it, Lulu.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.890
Now everybody tool up.

35:30.923 --> 35:32.792
The moment these doors open,

35:32.825 --> 35:34.894
we're gonna be
in a world of shit.

35:45.805 --> 35:48.675
The second sun
is closing in.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.544
Time is not our friend.

35:52.645 --> 35:54.714
Swarm the ship.

35:54.747 --> 35:58.417
Find every survivor,
and crush them.

35:58.450 --> 35:59.986
Rip out their spines.

36:00.019 --> 36:02.655
Cut out their hearts.

36:02.689 --> 36:05.424
Just don't damage the ship.

36:06.391 --> 36:08.661
If you do...

36:08.695 --> 36:11.396
I will eat your black hearts!

36:19.572 --> 36:20.773
Follow me.

36:23.543 --> 36:25.011
Hey.

36:25.044 --> 36:27.547
Who were you talking to
back there?

36:27.580 --> 36:30.282
I have an imaginary friend.

36:30.315 --> 36:31.651
What's their name, then?

36:31.684 --> 36:32.785
Instasquitch.

36:35.353 --> 36:36.556
Uh-huh.

36:39.058 --> 36:40.860
<i>Are you sure
about this, Cowboy?</i>

36:40.893 --> 36:43.295
Okay.

36:43.328 --> 36:45.765
<i>We can't see anything
down here.</i>

36:56.876 --> 36:57.877
Huh?

36:57.910 --> 36:59.011
Hey.

37:01.914 --> 37:04.016
I can't see. Hoo.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.918
Huh? Huh?

37:05.952 --> 37:06.986
Huh?

37:07.987 --> 37:09.789
Hey, hey, hey.

37:09.822 --> 37:11.490
Oh.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.692
Try these.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.294
Cowboy, Brock just
gave me his goggles.

37:16.328 --> 37:18.664
<i>Put 'em on. Put 'em on.</i>

37:18.698 --> 37:19.732
Oh.

37:23.736 --> 37:25.337
What do you see, kid?

37:25.370 --> 37:26.672
- Oh.
- What do you see?

37:35.748 --> 37:37.583
They found us.
Follow me.

37:38.684 --> 37:39.852
<i>There's smoke everywhere.</i>

37:39.886 --> 37:41.020
<i>Take us down a level.</i>

37:41.053 --> 37:42.855
Okay. Sure.

37:42.889 --> 37:44.557
<i>You need to get us
out of here.</i>

37:44.590 --> 37:46.092
- It's like a maze.
- <i>I know.</i>

37:46.125 --> 37:47.526
<i>Just keep us away
from them, Cowboy.</i>

37:47.560 --> 37:48.694
Yeah, I'm trying.

37:53.833 --> 37:54.867
<i>Cowboy, wait.</i>

37:54.901 --> 37:56.702
It's okay. I can see 'em.

37:58.503 --> 38:01.073
Should be safe here.

38:01.107 --> 38:02.875
- <i>They found us.</i>
- Oh, wait! My bad!

38:08.881 --> 38:10.315
This way, losers.

38:12.517 --> 38:14.519
Four against a team
of space ninjas.

38:14.554 --> 38:17.757
I like these odds.
What about you, team?

38:17.790 --> 38:19.424
Gotta know
your limits, kid.

38:20.458 --> 38:21.627
Ah.

38:21.661 --> 38:22.829
Uh...

38:22.862 --> 38:24.429
shit!

38:24.462 --> 38:25.998
I cannot believe
that I am complicit

38:26.032 --> 38:29.569
in this coward... Oh, shit!

38:39.579 --> 38:40.913
I know this room.

38:42.782 --> 38:43.883
Sarah, look out!

38:43.916 --> 38:45.084
<i>Do something!</i>

38:47.452 --> 38:48.688
Man...

38:53.491 --> 38:54.327
Commander?

39:08.808 --> 39:10.408
<i>Help!</i>

39:10.442 --> 39:12.178
<i>Max! Max, we're in here!</i>

39:12.211 --> 39:13.179
Huh?

39:41.173 --> 39:42.407
Huh?

40:06.899 --> 40:07.934
<i>Max!</i>

40:08.901 --> 40:10.002
<i>Hurry up!</i>

40:16.008 --> 40:18.010
Ho!

40:20.680 --> 40:22.148
- Hello.
- <i>Help!</i>

40:22.181 --> 40:24.016
- Commander?
- <i>Help us, Max!</i>

40:24.050 --> 40:27.053
Soldier, if you can hear me,

40:27.086 --> 40:32.224
do not fear! Max Cloud is here!

40:37.763 --> 40:39.065
Welcome back.

40:39.098 --> 40:41.000
You got <i>cajónes,</i> amigo.

40:41.033 --> 40:43.202
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
It was easy.

40:43.235 --> 40:46.172
Bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

40:46.205 --> 40:48.240
Ah, you ruined it.

40:50.643 --> 40:51.644
Oh.

40:51.677 --> 40:52.878
Hmm.

40:53.846 --> 40:55.681
Cowboy...

40:55.715 --> 40:56.782
Agh.

40:56.816 --> 40:58.551
Uh...

40:59.318 --> 41:00.553
what is he doing?

41:00.586 --> 41:01.887
Cowboy, turn me around.

41:01.921 --> 41:03.723
What the hell are you doing?

41:03.756 --> 41:05.257
- Uh, you okay there, kid?
- Yeah!

41:05.291 --> 41:07.994
Yeah, I'm just
checking out the wall.

41:08.027 --> 41:09.862
- Commander, what is he doing?
- Ow. Seriously, Cowboy.

41:09.895 --> 41:11.230
Cowboy, can you hear me?

41:11.263 --> 41:13.299
- Looks like he's rubbing...
- Cowboy.

41:13.332 --> 41:16.569
- himself up against the wall.
- Cowboy.

41:16.602 --> 41:19.772
<i>Cowboy,
can you hear me?</i>

41:19.805 --> 41:21.307
<i>Where are you?</i>

41:21.340 --> 41:22.675
<i>What are you doing?</i>

41:22.708 --> 41:24.143
Sarah, you still there?

41:25.611 --> 41:27.113
<i>What the hell?</i>

41:27.146 --> 41:29.815
Uh, my bad. But I was
gonna pee in my pants,

41:29.849 --> 41:31.684
and, uh, I knew
I had a few minutes

41:31.717 --> 41:33.119
while you were safe
in that room.

41:33.152 --> 41:34.787
<i>Don't do that again.</i>

41:34.820 --> 41:36.155
<i>This isn't a game.</i>

41:37.656 --> 41:38.758
Yeah.

41:42.862 --> 41:45.064
This vent's all, uh, checked.

41:45.097 --> 41:48.067
Quick jerking around.
We got work to do.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.002
Hang on.

41:50.036 --> 41:51.804
We need this first.

41:55.841 --> 41:56.909
Yes!

41:56.942 --> 41:58.778
<i>That was legit.</i>

41:58.811 --> 42:01.180
Yeah, uh, a little tap
would have done it, Cowboy.

42:01.213 --> 42:02.782
I gotta be honest
with you, soldier.

42:02.815 --> 42:05.251
That was pretty damn impressive.

42:05.284 --> 42:06.585
Watch this.

42:10.089 --> 42:11.257
Hmm.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.994
That was not impressive.

42:26.639 --> 42:28.274
Wait. Commander Rexy,

42:28.307 --> 42:30.576
is the core safe for handling?

42:34.413 --> 42:38.217
A safe distance of one meter
must be kept from the core

42:38.250 --> 42:41.087
at all times
to avoid contamination.

42:43.255 --> 42:44.690
Pussycats.

42:47.393 --> 42:48.794
The humiliation.

42:48.828 --> 42:50.696
A woman's taken the initiative.

42:50.729 --> 42:52.731
Commander,
have you lost your head?

42:52.765 --> 42:54.867
You're gonna lose yours
if you stay up here.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.302
Now come on, boys. Hurry up.

42:56.335 --> 42:57.803
In you go.

43:01.407 --> 43:03.109
Now you, Sarah.

43:06.445 --> 43:08.080
<i>Wrong tunnel.</i>

43:09.949 --> 43:11.650
<i>No, not yet, Cowboy.</i>

43:11.684 --> 43:13.052
Oh, come on.

43:17.323 --> 43:18.791
<i>Get us out of here.</i>

43:18.824 --> 43:20.993
Okay, guys, down you go.

43:23.129 --> 43:24.830
Yes. Finally.

43:24.864 --> 43:26.365
Out of my way, soldier.

43:26.398 --> 43:28.134
Hurry up, you lot!

43:39.011 --> 43:42.348
Oh, I should have never stopped
my aerobics classes.

43:42.381 --> 43:44.850
Okay.

43:50.489 --> 43:51.891
Ah.

43:51.924 --> 43:53.192
<i>What are you doing out there?</i>

43:53.225 --> 43:54.793
Just trying to help.

43:57.997 --> 43:59.198
- Hello?
- <i>Hello. 911.</i>

43:59.231 --> 44:01.033
- Police?
- <i>What?</i>

44:01.066 --> 44:03.135
- <i>Cowboy, hang up!</i>
- This is gonna sound crazy,

44:03.169 --> 44:06.138
but my friend,
she's stuck in <i>Max Cloud.</i>

44:06.172 --> 44:08.073
- <i>The video game?</i>
- The video game, yeah.

44:08.107 --> 44:10.109
<i>Cowboy, they
will think you're on drugs.</i>

44:10.142 --> 44:11.911
<i>They'll show up
and turn the game off.</i>

44:11.944 --> 44:13.846
<i>So, uh,
what can you tell me?</i>

44:13.879 --> 44:15.948
We're on the later stages,
and, uh, shit's getting crazy.

44:15.981 --> 44:17.850
<i>No, no, no,
this is a bad idea.</i>

44:17.883 --> 44:19.451
- <i>Okay, that's, uh...</i>
- You know, uh,

44:19.485 --> 44:21.787
just... just forget it.
I'm a... I'm a crazy person.

44:21.820 --> 44:24.390
<i>You know, wasting police time's
a criminal offense, sir.</i>

44:24.423 --> 44:27.893
<i>You can get fined $1,000,
so hang up now, please, son.</i>

44:27.927 --> 44:30.829
Yeah, okay.

44:35.301 --> 44:37.136
Sorry about that, Sarah.

44:37.169 --> 44:38.337
It's just you and me.

44:38.370 --> 44:40.105
<i>Well, that's good to hear.</i>

44:59.858 --> 45:02.127
Should we help?

45:02.161 --> 45:04.830
Nah. Just leave them to it.

45:04.863 --> 45:07.266
Max and Brock
have got this, okay?

45:08.867 --> 45:10.537
We've never got this far
before, Sarah.

45:10.570 --> 45:12.204
<i>I'm not gonna know
what's coming.</i>

45:12.238 --> 45:13.205
It's fine.

45:13.239 --> 45:14.340
We're gonna be fine.

45:14.373 --> 45:16.308
We just need to be relaxed.

45:16.342 --> 45:20.479
We need to focus, and we'll
get through it together, okay?

45:20.512 --> 45:22.281
These two actually love it.

45:24.516 --> 45:25.517
Hey!

45:25.552 --> 45:26.518
Ah.

45:29.521 --> 45:31.257
<i>They make it look easy.</i>

45:31.290 --> 45:33.993
So what was the point
in that back flip?

45:34.026 --> 45:36.095
Ho!

45:36.128 --> 45:37.863
Hmm. Working out?

45:39.298 --> 45:41.066
Shee!

45:41.100 --> 45:44.236
My reputation precedes me.

45:44.270 --> 45:46.573
But be assured...

45:46.606 --> 45:50.342
I am significantly crueler
than even the worst stories say.

45:50.376 --> 45:51.176
Great.

45:52.545 --> 45:55.114
Woah. She is terrifying
in the flesh.

45:55.147 --> 45:56.181
Ehh.

45:57.950 --> 46:02.021
Uh, Sarah, I'm kinda
freaking out right now.

46:02.054 --> 46:04.356
Okay.

46:04.390 --> 46:07.259
Come on.
Pull yourself together, Cowboy.

46:11.463 --> 46:13.600
Okay, come on.

46:13.633 --> 46:15.134
<i>We're gonna need</i>

46:15.167 --> 46:17.002
<i>more than fists
for this fight.</i>

46:17.036 --> 46:18.571
Plasma gun.

46:20.973 --> 46:23.342
Okay, don't forget.
R1 to reload.

46:23.375 --> 46:24.476
R1?

46:26.178 --> 46:28.914
J-just keep shooting.

46:28.947 --> 46:30.416
<i>I know. Duh.</i>

46:46.365 --> 46:48.300
Rexy!

46:50.402 --> 46:52.237
Let's do this, Cowboy.

47:10.289 --> 47:11.558
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

47:11.591 --> 47:13.225
Rexy. Rexy!

47:14.960 --> 47:16.895
Brock, help. Rexy's hurt.

47:17.664 --> 47:19.398
Hey, it's okay.

47:19.431 --> 47:21.133
You're okay.

47:23.235 --> 47:25.003
Sarah!

47:25.037 --> 47:27.239
Brock's a bad guy?

47:27.272 --> 47:29.174
Sarah, are you okay?

47:31.043 --> 47:32.211
Ohh.

47:44.724 --> 47:46.325
Son of a bitch.

47:53.533 --> 47:55.535
You were late.

47:55.568 --> 47:57.604
What the hell?!

47:57.637 --> 48:00.205
The deal was
I get you the power core

48:00.239 --> 48:01.240
and you get me my...

48:01.273 --> 48:03.643
shiiiii...

48:10.249 --> 48:13.285
- One...
- <i>Top. Transfer across.</i>

48:13.318 --> 48:16.054
- Work it. Oh, that core.
- <i>Transfer mambo.</i>

48:16.088 --> 48:19.458
<i>Oh, yeah. Come on.
Basic toe, hup!</i>

48:19.491 --> 48:20.959
- Hiyah.
- <i>Pivot.</i>

48:20.993 --> 48:23.530
<i>Hoo! Great!</i>

48:23.563 --> 48:25.632
- <i>Pony on. Let's go.</i>
- One, and go.

48:25.665 --> 48:27.366
<i>Cross your top. Come on.</i>

48:27.399 --> 48:28.668
<i>Transfer across...</i>

48:28.701 --> 48:30.102
Revengor!

48:31.503 --> 48:33.238
<i>Again. Now one more time,
let's do it...</i>

48:33.272 --> 48:35.340
Shee, don't sneak up on me.

48:35.374 --> 48:37.409
- It peaks my anxiety!
- <i>Whoo!</i>

48:37.443 --> 48:39.311
- It makes me jittery.
- <i>Great. Pony on.</i>

48:39.344 --> 48:41.246
<i>Let's go. Cross your toes...</i>

48:41.280 --> 48:43.282
I assume the presence
of this space pirate

48:43.315 --> 48:44.717
means that you're almost done.

48:44.751 --> 48:46.485
- <i>Transfer mambo.</i>
- Aw, Jesus.

48:46.518 --> 48:48.387
Space cowboy, amigo.

48:48.420 --> 48:50.222
- Space cowboy.
- Ah.

48:50.255 --> 48:51.758
We've spoken
about this before.

48:51.791 --> 48:54.326
I am not having
a conversation with you

48:54.359 --> 48:57.296
whilst you're doing
whatever it is you're doing.

48:57.329 --> 49:02.000
I'm just working on my fitness
for my revenge on planet Earth.

49:02.034 --> 49:03.770
- Ahh.
- <i>Now back to body.</i>

49:03.803 --> 49:05.672
- <i>Come on, basic.</i>
- I'm waiting.

49:05.705 --> 49:07.640
<i>Pivot!</i>

49:07.674 --> 49:09.341
<i>Great!</i>

49:09.374 --> 49:10.577
<i>Pony on.</i>

49:13.680 --> 49:15.314
Go.

49:15.347 --> 49:18.517
The survivors were in possession
of a power core.

49:18.551 --> 49:21.453
Brock went in,
proved to be utterly useless,

49:21.487 --> 49:24.223
so I went to them myself
and destroyed it.

49:24.256 --> 49:25.625
We couldn't risk them escaping.

49:25.658 --> 49:27.025
And the ship?

49:27.059 --> 49:29.428
Yeah, what about my ship, Shee?

49:29.461 --> 49:31.029
What about our deal?

49:31.063 --> 49:33.298
The prisoners
are bringing it to us.

49:33.332 --> 49:36.034
Ah, the survivors.

49:36.068 --> 49:39.572
Including that devilishly
handsome Max Cloud?

49:39.606 --> 49:41.073
Taken care of.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.609
- Yeah.
- Woah, woah, woah.

49:42.642 --> 49:44.343
What does that mean?

49:44.376 --> 49:45.745
You said you wouldn't hurt them.

49:45.778 --> 49:47.547
Hush!

49:47.580 --> 49:50.048
Anything else?
I'm cooling down here.

49:50.817 --> 49:52.752
The ship won't be long...

49:53.820 --> 49:55.622
so make sure you're ready.

49:56.589 --> 49:58.791
I'll finish my video,
and then I'll pack.

50:00.492 --> 50:01.628
<i>Across the top.</i>

50:01.661 --> 50:03.228
Oh, and, Shee,

50:03.262 --> 50:06.599
why can I still
smell Donnelly? Huh?

50:06.633 --> 50:07.700
Ahh.

50:08.668 --> 50:10.202
<i>Across the back.</i>

50:10.235 --> 50:10.803
Yeah, back in your box.

50:14.807 --> 50:17.242
Uh, I don't want to add
to a bad situation,

50:17.276 --> 50:19.211
but Max is on his way.

50:22.414 --> 50:23.650
He took the power core.

50:23.683 --> 50:25.818
- Who?
- Brock.

50:25.852 --> 50:27.152
What happened?

50:27.185 --> 50:29.321
Brock betrayed us.

50:29.354 --> 50:31.490
- I told you!
- I didn't see it coming.

50:31.523 --> 50:33.693
I knew we shouldn't have
trusted that criminal.

50:33.726 --> 50:35.360
You should have listened
to me, Commander.

50:35.394 --> 50:37.797
He could have killed me.
He just stunned me.

50:37.830 --> 50:39.666
Come on. Brock can't be
a bad guy. That...

50:39.699 --> 50:41.601
Of course he's a bad guy.
He's left us!

50:41.634 --> 50:44.537
Abandoned us!
Left us to fry to death!

50:44.571 --> 50:45.605
It's over!

50:47.707 --> 50:49.676
There must be another way.

50:49.709 --> 50:52.377
Wh-why didn't Shee kill us?

50:53.680 --> 50:56.114
Come on! You're Max Cloud!

51:01.353 --> 51:04.423
Shee sent something else
to finish the job.

51:04.456 --> 51:05.692
- End of level...
- Boss.

51:06.859 --> 51:09.361
<i>Zuko! Zuko!</i>

51:15.300 --> 51:17.302
All right, let's do this.

51:18.738 --> 51:19.772
Come on.

51:22.675 --> 51:24.476
Hey, watch out.

51:24.509 --> 51:25.878
Guys, keep it going.

51:27.512 --> 51:29.649
Max, no!

51:34.654 --> 51:37.757
<i>Zuko Sumo Fudge.</i>

51:37.790 --> 51:38.825
We did it.

51:40.258 --> 51:42.461
We actually did it.

51:42.494 --> 51:43.763
<i>Yes!</i>

51:43.796 --> 51:45.565
<i>Well done, Cowboy.</i>

51:45.598 --> 51:47.734
I'm feeling
pretty darn confident right now.

51:47.767 --> 51:49.434
<i>Don't get complacent.</i>

51:49.468 --> 51:51.738
If I actually
get you out of here,

51:51.771 --> 51:53.505
you definitely owe me a date.

51:53.539 --> 51:54.941
Ehh? Wha...

51:54.974 --> 51:56.843
Max! Max is hurt!

51:56.876 --> 51:58.477
Huh.

51:58.510 --> 52:00.546
I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:00.580 --> 52:02.381
- Ohh!
- What are we gonna do now?

52:02.414 --> 52:04.249
Our only power core
has been destroyed,

52:04.282 --> 52:06.184
and this ship
isn't going anywhere.

52:06.218 --> 52:08.788
That's strange,
'cause we appear to be moving.

52:17.864 --> 52:20.499
That sun is getting
pretty damn close.

52:28.808 --> 52:31.476
Where are they taking us?

52:31.510 --> 52:33.245
<i>This must be it, Sarah.</i>

52:33.278 --> 52:35.581
<i>I saw something about it
in the game guide,</i>

52:35.615 --> 52:38.618
<i>the final levels,
Revengor's Lair.</i>

52:40.452 --> 52:42.187
They're taking us to Revengor.

52:43.355 --> 52:44.891
Revengor?

52:44.924 --> 52:47.359
He's just a myth.

52:47.392 --> 52:48.928
Doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

52:48.961 --> 52:51.396
<i>It might be
our only way out of here.</i>

52:51.430 --> 52:54.567
You better hope
that he does exist.

52:54.600 --> 52:57.704
'Cause right now, he may be
the only way out of here.

52:57.737 --> 53:02.675
And how exactly is Revengor
gonna help us get out of here?

53:09.314 --> 53:10.783
Okay, found it.

53:14.987 --> 53:17.355
Oh, backstory.

53:17.389 --> 53:20.760
"Revengor hasn't always
been known as Revengor.

53:20.793 --> 53:22.962
In fact,
he used to be called Jeremy."

53:22.995 --> 53:26.231
Well, he used to be
known as Jeremy.

53:27.533 --> 53:28.634
Jeremy?

53:28.668 --> 53:31.336
I'm not surprised.

53:31.369 --> 53:32.872
Nobody's gonna be scared
of a Jeremy.

53:32.905 --> 53:34.741
Revengor, yeah, but Jeremy...

53:34.774 --> 53:37.009
I'm sorry. What's this
got to do with anything?

53:37.043 --> 53:39.746
I'm trying to explain.

53:39.779 --> 53:42.014
"Before he ended up on Heinous,

53:42.048 --> 53:44.282
Jeremy worked for NASA
on planet Earth."

53:45.517 --> 53:48.054
Before he ended up on Heinous,

53:48.087 --> 53:51.289
Jeremy used to work for NASA
on planet Earth.

53:51.323 --> 53:53.593
He was taking his team out
on a mission,

53:53.626 --> 53:54.694
and they crash-landed.

53:55.661 --> 53:56.763
Long story short,

53:56.796 --> 53:59.397
no one ever came to rescue them,

53:59.431 --> 54:01.601
and he was
the only one to survive.

54:01.634 --> 54:04.804
Well, just about.

54:04.837 --> 54:07.006
He would have died
if it wasn't for Shee.

54:08.340 --> 54:09.642
When she found him,

54:09.675 --> 54:12.310
he was hardly breathing.

54:12.344 --> 54:14.013
Some of his limbs were missing.

54:15.081 --> 54:17.750
She used her sorcery
to fix him,

54:17.784 --> 54:19.685
bring him back up to strength.

54:19.719 --> 54:20.953
When she had...

54:22.521 --> 54:24.090
Jeremy was gone.

54:24.123 --> 54:25.725
This man was different.

54:25.758 --> 54:30.930
He was powerful, but empty,

54:30.963 --> 54:33.099
the kind of emptiness
which is dark,

54:33.132 --> 54:35.535
so dark that you
forget how to feel.

54:35.568 --> 54:37.603
Not totally surprising,

54:37.637 --> 54:40.106
considering he
doesn't have a heart.

54:40.139 --> 54:43.876
He survives off a power core
located in his chest.

54:45.477 --> 54:49.514
And so Revengor came to be.

54:49.549 --> 54:51.818
He took over the planet with
Shee as his right-hand woman,

54:51.851 --> 54:55.353
and together,
they rule the prisoners.

54:55.387 --> 54:57.957
"Ever since then, Revengor
has been waiting for a ship..."

54:57.990 --> 55:00.760
...so he can return to Earth
and get his revenge

55:00.793 --> 55:02.929
on the planet
that abandoned him.

55:02.962 --> 55:06.364
So we need to get
his power core

55:06.398 --> 55:08.433
before he gets our ship.

55:08.466 --> 55:10.870
Or planet Earth
is in mortal danger.

55:10.903 --> 55:13.806
The fate of the universe
lies in the hands of...

55:15.541 --> 55:17.743
Sorry. That... Habit.

55:18.711 --> 55:20.478
So what do we do now?

55:20.512 --> 55:22.114
We sit tight.

55:23.783 --> 55:25.417
<i>Hey, Sarah...</i>

55:25.450 --> 55:28.821
FYI, you just owned the room.

55:40.132 --> 55:42.367
So what's your real name, then?

55:43.903 --> 55:44.904
Jake.

55:44.937 --> 55:46.005
<i>She knows.</i>

55:46.038 --> 55:47.840
<i>H-how could she know?</i>

55:47.874 --> 55:50.877
<i>Tell her, Sarah.
She might be able to help.</i>

55:50.910 --> 55:52.945
I can't.

55:52.979 --> 55:55.982
See, who are you talking to
when you do that?

55:56.015 --> 55:59.652
What did you mean
when you said, "R1," earlier?

55:59.685 --> 56:01.087
Nothing. I-I didn't mean any...

56:01.120 --> 56:03.089
So it had nothing
to do with the fact

56:03.122 --> 56:05.191
that if you keep your finger
pressed down on R1 when firing,

56:05.224 --> 56:07.492
it will automatically
reload your weapon?

56:08.661 --> 56:10.796
How do you know that?

56:10.830 --> 56:12.031
I'm Sofia.

56:14.533 --> 56:15.668
I'm Sarah.

56:15.701 --> 56:17.502
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

56:18.671 --> 56:19.972
Nice to meet you, Sarah.

56:20.006 --> 56:22.008
Oh, my God.
It happened to you, too?

56:22.041 --> 56:24.442
I've got so many questions.

56:24.476 --> 56:25.878
I don't have many answers.

56:25.912 --> 56:27.613
Are there any more of us?

56:27.647 --> 56:30.549
Look, all I know
is that I've never

56:30.583 --> 56:32.218
met anyone else in here before,

56:32.251 --> 56:34.620
and the game characters,
they haven't got a clue.

56:34.654 --> 56:36.622
They're oblivious,
completely unaware.

56:36.656 --> 56:37.890
Have you been here long?

56:37.924 --> 56:39.524
Feels like forever.

56:39.558 --> 56:41.160
Okay.

56:41.193 --> 56:44.063
Well, we can't
be stuck here forever.

56:44.096 --> 56:45.965
I mean, there must be
a way out, right?

56:46.966 --> 56:48.466
What about the Space Witch?

56:48.500 --> 56:50.169
- Space Witch.
- Mm.

56:50.202 --> 56:52.838
That's the last thing I remember
before I ended up in here.

56:52.872 --> 56:54.573
- Me, too.
- <i>Hey, tell Sofia...</i>

56:54.607 --> 56:56.042
<i>Cowboy says, "What's up?"</i>

56:56.075 --> 56:57.677
- Be quiet, Cowboy.
- <i>Eh...</i>

56:57.710 --> 56:58.945
- Who's Cowboy?
- He's my best friend.

56:58.978 --> 57:00.478
- He's controlling me.
- Wait.

57:00.512 --> 57:01.547
Someone's controlling you
right now?

57:01.580 --> 57:02.915
Yeah.

57:02.949 --> 57:04.250
And you can communicate
with them?

57:04.283 --> 57:05.785
Is no one controlling you?

57:05.818 --> 57:07.620
No. I-I always played alone.
Hang on.

57:07.653 --> 57:11.157
So if... if your friend
can complete the game, then we...

57:11.190 --> 57:13.159
And we could find
the Space Witch!

57:13.192 --> 57:15.728
And then we might actually have
a chance of getting out of here!

57:16.696 --> 57:18.097
Yes!

57:18.130 --> 57:19.699
Please tell me
your friend's not shit.

57:38.684 --> 57:40.553
- Commander.
- How's the arm?

57:41.854 --> 57:43.222
It's fine.

57:44.857 --> 57:46.726
I'm sorry about Brock.

57:48.227 --> 57:49.929
It's not your fault.

57:49.962 --> 57:51.130
We weren't to know.

57:56.736 --> 57:59.305
So how does it feel...

57:59.338 --> 58:02.975
having this special
little moment with Max Cloud?

58:03.009 --> 58:04.577
Do you want
to finish it yourself?

58:04.610 --> 58:05.778
I'm messing with you.

58:07.747 --> 58:10.549
Well, that's something
I don't often see,

58:10.583 --> 58:11.684
little smile...

58:11.717 --> 58:15.154
from the unflappable Rexy.

58:17.089 --> 58:19.158
Can I ask you something?

58:19.191 --> 58:20.226
Sure.

58:21.794 --> 58:23.729
Why do you put on the act?

58:24.764 --> 58:26.799
What act? I'm Max Cloud,

58:26.832 --> 58:28.834
- intergalactic space hero...
- Come on.

58:30.036 --> 58:31.537
There's nobody else here.

58:34.306 --> 58:36.275
You really want to know?

58:36.308 --> 58:38.210
I really want to know.

58:40.679 --> 58:43.215
I never really wanted all this.

58:43.249 --> 58:47.753
Being a space hero doesn't
exactly come naturally to me.

58:48.721 --> 58:50.122
So what does?

58:52.158 --> 58:53.192
Pastry.

58:55.027 --> 58:57.229
- Pastry?
- Mm-hmm.

58:57.263 --> 58:59.098
I get pastry.

58:59.131 --> 59:01.967
Always have, always will,
ever since I was a little kid.

59:05.137 --> 59:08.808
You know,
my mother was a pastry chef.

59:08.841 --> 59:11.844
When I was younger,
I used to love nothing more

59:11.877 --> 59:13.846
than helping her in the kitchen.

59:13.879 --> 59:16.615
The attention to detail.

59:16.649 --> 59:19.351
Watching her tiny hands
quickly shape

59:19.385 --> 59:22.755
the most intricate
and delicate of pastries.

59:24.056 --> 59:27.093
The Mille feuilles
to Paris-Brest.

59:27.126 --> 59:29.361
Oh, and her Madeleines...

59:29.395 --> 59:32.064
well,
they were lighter than air.

59:33.699 --> 59:35.167
She made it like an art.

59:36.202 --> 59:38.170
All I wanted to do in life

59:38.204 --> 59:40.039
was to be able to bake pastries

59:40.072 --> 59:42.908
as elegant
and as beautiful as hers.

59:45.444 --> 59:47.146
But after she died,

59:47.179 --> 59:49.715
I would sneak into the kitchen
and bake alone

59:49.748 --> 59:52.017
until one night,
my father found me,

59:52.051 --> 59:54.954
and he sent me off
to space academy.

59:54.987 --> 59:57.890
Now here I am,
intergalactic space hero,

59:57.923 --> 01:00:00.726
but I've not baked
a pastry since.

01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:04.964
You have no idea
how much I envy Jake

01:00:04.997 --> 01:00:06.799
in that kitchen all day.

01:00:06.832 --> 01:00:09.301
I'm sure you can go
in the kitchen if you want to.

01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:11.971
Space heroes don't have time
for baking, okay?

01:00:12.004 --> 01:00:14.273
You're allowed
to pass the ball, Max.

01:00:14.306 --> 01:00:16.075
Oh, yeah?

01:00:16.108 --> 01:00:17.143
Look who's talking.

01:00:19.812 --> 01:00:21.447
- You know what?
- What?

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.149
If you were someone different...

01:00:23.182 --> 01:00:25.151
- Yeah?
- we might have been friends.

01:00:40.766 --> 01:00:44.737
Revengor's Lair
or Space Slug Smackdown?

01:00:45.871 --> 01:00:47.973
Oh, no, stupid.
What am I thinking?

01:00:48.007 --> 01:00:50.776
Always Revengor's Lair.

01:00:52.144 --> 01:00:56.115
Ah, Stars and Sunbeams?

01:00:56.148 --> 01:00:59.418
I've always found that
quite relaxing.

01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:04.390
That might help calm me down
after a hard day's revenging.

01:01:04.423 --> 01:01:07.259
Maybe I could take it
out of the box.

01:01:07.293 --> 01:01:09.328
Ah, that's crazy talk.

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.497
What am I saying?

01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:17.169
- The ship has arrived.
- Ah.

01:01:17.203 --> 01:01:23.042
Ah, the moment
we've been waiting for, Shee,

01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:26.011
it's finally here.

01:01:26.045 --> 01:01:29.315
Nothing can stop us now.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:32.318
I woke up this morning,

01:01:32.351 --> 01:01:37.923
and I knew today was
gonna be a wonderful day

01:01:37.957 --> 01:01:40.960
full of death and retribution.

01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:43.530
You will be
a magnificent captain.

01:01:43.563 --> 01:01:45.297
Yes, I know.

01:01:46.533 --> 01:01:48.234
Earth will rue the day

01:01:48.267 --> 01:01:51.270
they ever left me
to rot on Heinous.

01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:53.872
It will always be your Heinous.

01:01:53.906 --> 01:01:55.341
Our Heinous.

01:01:56.842 --> 01:02:01.013
And soon it will be our Earth.

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:06.852
I feel like celebrating.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.335
I don't know
if I can do this, Sarah.

01:02:23.369 --> 01:02:27.172
<i>What happened to, "I'm feeling
pretty darn confident now"?</i>

01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:29.141
That was
postbattle buzz talking.

01:02:29.174 --> 01:02:32.511
But now I know we're heading
into Revengor's Lair.

01:02:32.545 --> 01:02:35.814
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

01:02:35.848 --> 01:02:38.585
If we lose this game,
we lose you, too,

01:02:38.618 --> 01:02:41.554
and I don't know
what I'd do if...

01:02:41.588 --> 01:02:43.889
<i>I believe in you, Cowboy.</i>

01:02:45.858 --> 01:02:48.160
Okay.

01:02:48.193 --> 01:02:50.996
Okay, but you can't blame me
if I pee on your carpet.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.398
- Oh, yes, I can.
- Tony!

01:02:52.431 --> 01:02:55.334
Uh, Tony's here.
Your dad's here.

01:02:55.367 --> 01:02:56.502
<i>Damn it.</i>

01:02:56.536 --> 01:02:58.103
Watch those cuss words, Sarah.

01:02:58.137 --> 01:03:00.039
- Where is she?
- Uh...

01:03:00.072 --> 01:03:02.241
And you know you're not supposed
to be playing this weekend.

01:03:02.274 --> 01:03:03.409
Turn it off, please, Cowboy.

01:03:03.442 --> 01:03:06.178
I-I can't. If we turn it off,

01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:08.480
she'll die
and be stuck in there forever.

01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:10.082
What are you talking about?

01:03:10.115 --> 01:03:11.350
Just save the game,
and turn it off.

01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:13.385
Uh...

01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:16.355
And, Sarah, you better get
out here right now, young lady,

01:03:16.388 --> 01:03:18.157
or you're gonna be
in big trouble.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:21.427
<i>Yeah, that's sort of
not possible right now.</i>

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.262
Fine. I'll turn it off.

01:03:23.295 --> 01:03:24.997
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.032
- Sorry.
- Out of my way, Cowboy.

01:03:27.066 --> 01:03:29.301
<i>Dad, it's me. I'm in the game.</i>

01:03:29.335 --> 01:03:30.469
What?

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:33.305
Look, Tony, you gotta listen.

01:03:33.339 --> 01:03:34.973
What the heck is going on?

01:03:35.007 --> 01:03:37.577
Just please, please listen
to your daughter.

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.412
<i>Dad, it really is me.
I'm stuck in here.</i>

01:03:40.446 --> 01:03:41.914
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:44.183
She's inside the game.

01:03:44.216 --> 01:03:48.420
Now, I know this sounds crazy,
okay, but, uh...

01:03:51.223 --> 01:03:52.958
- Just...
- Sarah?

01:03:55.461 --> 01:03:56.528
You there, sweetie?

01:03:56.563 --> 01:03:58.598
<i>I-I can hear you, Dad.</i>

01:03:58.631 --> 01:04:00.432
<i>Please don't turn off the game.</i>

01:04:00.466 --> 01:04:02.901
<i>I don't want to be trapped
in here forever.</i>

01:04:02.935 --> 01:04:04.903
- <i>I want to come home.</i>
- Okay.

01:04:04.937 --> 01:04:06.606
Okay, trust me, honey.

01:04:06.639 --> 01:04:09.542
Cowboy, open that package
over there.

01:04:09.576 --> 01:04:11.477
Okay.

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:12.612
Sarah...

01:04:14.513 --> 01:04:16.281
I have a confession to make.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:20.319
I'm a gamer, Sarah.

01:04:20.352 --> 01:04:23.055
Always have been.
Always will be.

01:04:23.088 --> 01:04:26.225
<i>Huh. This makes sense now.</i>

01:04:26.258 --> 01:04:29.461
<i>So that's what you and Mom
were always arguing about.</i>

01:04:29.495 --> 01:04:32.164
Only because of what
it did to me, honey.

01:04:32.197 --> 01:04:33.700
We'll talk about this later.

01:04:33.733 --> 01:04:36.368
Right now,
we gotta finish this game

01:04:36.402 --> 01:04:38.303
and get you home.

01:04:38.337 --> 01:04:39.405
You ready?

01:04:39.438 --> 01:04:41.173
<i>I'm ready, Dad.</i>

01:04:42.141 --> 01:04:43.643
<i>Let's do this.</i>

01:04:49.481 --> 01:04:50.650
Oh, man.

01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:03.462
Okay.
Big Tony, you got this.

01:05:03.495 --> 01:05:04.496
You got this.

01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:11.571
That's it. Relax.

01:05:11.604 --> 01:05:14.973
End the game.
I know you can do this.

01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:19.478
Are the walls moving?

01:05:20.479 --> 01:05:22.014
What are you talking about?

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:24.216
The walls aren't...

01:05:24.249 --> 01:05:26.185
The walls are moving.

01:05:26.218 --> 01:05:29.521
Shh! Quiet, Rexy. Quiet.

01:05:29.556 --> 01:05:31.724
We need to freak out quietly.

01:05:31.758 --> 01:05:33.560
Slug... Ahh! Ohh!

01:05:45.404 --> 01:05:48.340
I hope this doesn't
come off as weird, Tony,

01:05:48.373 --> 01:05:50.509
but you are magnificent.

01:06:04.122 --> 01:06:07.125
I-I'm never gonna
feel clean again.

01:06:07.159 --> 01:06:08.728
You hear that?

01:06:10.563 --> 01:06:12.197
Stick with me.

01:06:12.231 --> 01:06:13.733
We've got your back, Max.

01:06:24.611 --> 01:06:26.679
Come on, Brock.

01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:29.414
Pirates like to dance.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:31.316
Show us some moves.

01:06:45.698 --> 01:06:47.634
Oh, yeah.

01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.334
Party on.

01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:54.106
Let's huddle.

01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:57.376
Okay, what do you think
we should do, Rexy?

01:06:57.409 --> 01:06:58.510
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:58.545 --> 01:07:00.412
You're smarter than I am.

01:07:00.445 --> 01:07:02.782
Just took me a while to get
my head out of my own ass.

01:07:02.815 --> 01:07:04.516
- Thanks, Max.
- Mm.

01:07:04.551 --> 01:07:07.386
I think we should
go with Jake on this one.

01:07:07.419 --> 01:07:09.254
I say we do it
the Max Cloud way,

01:07:09.288 --> 01:07:11.523
loud, brash,
straight in the front door.

01:07:11.558 --> 01:07:12.792
Who's with me?

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:14.694
The Max Cloud way.

01:07:19.264 --> 01:07:21.166
Bit much.

01:07:21.199 --> 01:07:22.702
The Max Cloud way!

01:07:22.735 --> 01:07:24.704
- Hyah!
- Yay!

01:07:39.886 --> 01:07:41.821
Woah!

01:07:41.854 --> 01:07:43.856
Hey, Jeremy!

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.191
Give me back my ship!

01:07:46.224 --> 01:07:49.261
Now there's a name
I haven't heard in a long time.

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:52.532
It's not as bad as I remember.

01:07:52.565 --> 01:07:55.735
Jeremy Revengor.

01:07:55.768 --> 01:07:58.236
Hmm.

01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:01.473
Oh, Max...

01:08:01.506 --> 01:08:05.712
you truly are as handsome
as they say.

01:08:05.745 --> 01:08:07.279
That's right.

01:08:07.312 --> 01:08:09.147
I am beautiful!

01:08:09.181 --> 01:08:11.651
So you'd better take
a goddamn good look,

01:08:11.684 --> 01:08:13.920
'cause it's the last thing
you're ever gonna see!

01:08:20.627 --> 01:08:23.228
Someone bring me his face.

01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:26.698
"Taken care of," you said.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.403
The disappointment
is overwhelming.

01:08:43.482 --> 01:08:45.216
Hah! Uhh!

01:08:50.555 --> 01:08:53.325
Shee.

01:08:53.358 --> 01:08:55.359
That was a bit embarrassing.

01:08:55.394 --> 01:08:56.629
Take a timeout.

01:09:27.794 --> 01:09:29.227
Hah!

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:35.233
Oh, what the hell is this?

01:09:39.005 --> 01:09:40.707
A conscience.

01:09:43.341 --> 01:09:45.578
Where the hell'd that come from?

01:09:47.613 --> 01:09:48.648
No!

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:53.720
- Max!
- Max!

01:09:53.752 --> 01:09:56.488
Bummer.

01:10:14.707 --> 01:10:16.508
Uh, really?

01:10:17.476 --> 01:10:19.377
Last chance, Shee.

01:10:22.414 --> 01:10:23.850
There she is.

01:10:25.752 --> 01:10:28.821
Look who has grown a spine.

01:10:28.855 --> 01:10:31.490
Come to claim your bounty,
pirate?

01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:35.393
Come on, Shee. Shee!

01:10:38.698 --> 01:10:39.899
Is that all you got?

01:10:40.933 --> 01:10:42.635
Come on, Shee.

01:10:47.573 --> 01:10:48.708
Impossible.

01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:50.743
Oh, it's possible, darlin'.

01:10:52.879 --> 01:10:54.781
Brock Donnelly...

01:10:54.814 --> 01:10:56.783
never misses a bounty.

01:10:59.852 --> 01:11:01.654
The record stands.

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.765
Much obliged, darlin'.

01:11:12.799 --> 01:11:14.734
Anytime.

01:11:22.008 --> 01:11:24.342
- I got this.
- <i>We got this.</i>

01:11:24.376 --> 01:11:27.847
<i>Every game, every final level,
every boss...</i>

01:11:28.848 --> 01:11:30.049
<i>it was all for this.</i>

01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:32.118
I get to fight that guy

01:11:32.151 --> 01:11:33.886
or even that guy.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.355
I fight the main guy,
not the sidekicks.

01:11:37.389 --> 01:11:39.625
We don't have sidekicks.
We're a team.

01:11:39.659 --> 01:11:41.828
Brock, get the others
to the ship.

01:11:41.861 --> 01:11:43.796
Stand by.
I'm gonna get the power core.

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:44.864
- Let's dance!
- Woah, woah.

01:11:44.897 --> 01:11:46.966
Easy there, amigo.

01:11:46.999 --> 01:11:49.068
You cannot take Jeremy
on your own.

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:51.369
Yes, he can.

01:11:51.403 --> 01:11:52.470
You've got this.

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.943
Confidence.

01:11:56.976 --> 01:11:59.679
Good. Good for you.

01:12:09.789 --> 01:12:11.624
What happened?

01:12:11.657 --> 01:12:13.092
Did I save the universe again?

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.594
- You were fantastic.
- Ah.

01:12:14.627 --> 01:12:16.596
Let's go

01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:20.666
Fabulous.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.401
<i>Dad? Dad!
What's going on?</i>

01:12:23.435 --> 01:12:26.973
No. This can't be happening,
not now.

01:12:27.006 --> 01:12:28.440
Wh-what do we do?

01:12:33.613 --> 01:12:34.580
Oh, my God.

01:12:34.614 --> 01:12:36.015
<i>Round one.</i>

01:12:36.048 --> 01:12:37.550
I'm controlling myself.

01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:39.151
<i>Ready.</i>

01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:40.720
<i>Fight!</i>

01:12:42.454 --> 01:12:43.488
Ow!

01:12:45.057 --> 01:12:46.125
Ow!

01:12:49.527 --> 01:12:51.429
- Yeah!
- <i>Good work!</i>

01:13:01.107 --> 01:13:02.108
Ow!

01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:03.142
<i>Finish him.</i>

01:13:05.912 --> 01:13:07.780
<i>You win.</i>

01:13:09.682 --> 01:13:12.151
<i>Next round.</i>

01:13:12.184 --> 01:13:14.186
<i>Ready.</i>

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.721
<i>Fight.</i>

01:13:15.755 --> 01:13:17.924
I'll get you!

01:13:17.957 --> 01:13:19.424
Have this!

01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:39.745
You are nothing!

01:13:40.713 --> 01:13:42.480
<i>You lose.</i>

01:13:46.118 --> 01:13:47.987
<i>Pick yourself up.</i>

01:13:49.588 --> 01:13:51.991
Is that all you've got?

01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:56.629
This is why I wanted
to fight the main guy.

01:13:56.662 --> 01:13:57.997
<i>Final round.</i>

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.699
<i>Fight!</i>

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:04.136
Okay, look for
the pattern, Sarah.

01:14:10.609 --> 01:14:12.111
Here we go.

01:14:20.319 --> 01:14:22.520
Want some more?

01:14:25.925 --> 01:14:30.730
I will destroy you.

01:14:37.136 --> 01:14:38.838
<i>Good move.</i>

01:14:42.274 --> 01:14:46.212
You are irritating. Fight me!

01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:57.923
<i>Finish him.</i>

01:15:03.763 --> 01:15:04.864
Hah!

01:15:13.039 --> 01:15:14.874
<i>Power move!</i>

01:15:14.907 --> 01:15:16.275
Huh?

01:15:16.308 --> 01:15:18.644
Not the only one
that can ride a glitch.

01:15:23.949 --> 01:15:25.818
<i>Perfect!</i>

01:15:28.687 --> 01:15:30.656
Well, that was not ex...

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.761
<i>You win!</i>

01:15:42.768 --> 01:15:44.737
<i>We lost you.
How did you get...</i>

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.705
<i>You know what? Tell me later.</i>

01:15:46.739 --> 01:15:48.808
<i>Let's get you off this planet,
complete this game,</i>

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:50.209
<i>and get you home.</i>

01:15:50.242 --> 01:15:52.978
Yeah. I could not
agree with you more.

01:16:04.924 --> 01:16:06.759
God, I wish
I could do something!

01:16:06.792 --> 01:16:08.694
Commander...

01:16:08.727 --> 01:16:09.962
it's been an honor.

01:16:09.995 --> 01:16:11.997
I wish I could say the same.

01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:16.335
- Anyone order a power core?
- Yes, Sarah!

01:16:16.368 --> 01:16:18.404
Great work, kid!

01:16:18.437 --> 01:16:21.307
Right. Time to go home.
Where's Brock?

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.142
He dumped Shee here
and left us again.

01:16:23.175 --> 01:16:25.044
And, hey, who's Sarah?

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:31.150
All right, soldiers,
hold on to your butts.

01:16:31.183 --> 01:16:32.785
Let's do this.

01:16:34.353 --> 01:16:36.155
Max?

01:16:36.188 --> 01:16:38.257
Looks like we're still coupled
to the rest of the ship.

01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:41.093
Somebody's gonna have to
get out there and deal with it.

01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:45.364
Max, what do we do?
What do we do?!

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:48.000
- Uh...
- <i>Caution. Caution.</i>

01:16:48.033 --> 01:16:50.336
It's that space pirate.

01:16:50.369 --> 01:16:52.037
What the hell is he doing?!

01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:24.270
Yee-hoo!

01:17:35.381 --> 01:17:37.082
He saved us.

01:17:38.918 --> 01:17:40.886
I was wrong about him.

01:17:48.093 --> 01:17:49.361
Something's at the door.

01:17:50.429 --> 01:17:51.830
Helmets on.

01:18:21.961 --> 01:18:24.096
- You're alive!
- Ooh, yeah.

01:18:24.129 --> 01:18:25.831
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:25.864 --> 01:18:27.333
Easy, son.

01:18:27.366 --> 01:18:30.970
But you were fully on fire.

01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:32.371
Yeah.

01:18:33.339 --> 01:18:35.074
I am Brock Donnelly.

01:18:35.107 --> 01:18:36.408
Hah!

01:18:36.442 --> 01:18:39.245
Now that was lame.

01:18:39.278 --> 01:18:41.213
That was not an explanation.

01:18:52.224 --> 01:18:55.294
There are worse places
to be stuck for all eternity.

01:18:55.327 --> 01:18:58.030
I just thought
if we completed the game,

01:18:58.063 --> 01:19:01.100
then that would be it,
we get to go home.

01:19:04.103 --> 01:19:05.538
Dad, C-Cowboy...

01:19:07.206 --> 01:19:08.340
can you hear me?

01:19:11.143 --> 01:19:12.511
Looks like I'm stuck here.

01:19:14.446 --> 01:19:16.348
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

01:19:19.018 --> 01:19:20.185
No one's to blame.

01:19:21.621 --> 01:19:24.189
This is where I get off, amigo.

01:19:24.223 --> 01:19:26.859
Really? You're not staying?

01:19:26.892 --> 01:19:29.828
You know, I think you'd make
a great addition to the team.

01:19:36.368 --> 01:19:38.470
Old Brock Donnelly's
a lone wolf.

01:19:40.372 --> 01:19:41.541
Besides...

01:19:44.243 --> 01:19:46.912
I got to go collect
that bounty on Shee...

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.316
and get my ship back.

01:19:50.349 --> 01:19:53.852
You know, Brock,
after what you've done for us,

01:19:53.886 --> 01:19:56.088
I can get you
any ship in the galaxy.

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:03.228
Mine ain't
no ordinary ship.

01:20:12.572 --> 01:20:14.373
Looks like I'm going
to spend all of eternity

01:20:14.406 --> 01:20:17.577
looking for that...

01:20:20.212 --> 01:20:22.147
Space Witch.

01:20:39.699 --> 01:20:41.266
Sarah!

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.070
My dad,
the world's greatest gamer.

01:20:46.205 --> 01:20:47.940
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:49.041
Me, too.

01:20:50.042 --> 01:20:51.477
Hey!

01:20:57.049 --> 01:21:00.018
Man, it feels so good
to not be in that spacesuit.

01:21:00.052 --> 01:21:01.253
Sofia.

01:21:02.521 --> 01:21:04.156
You must be Sarah.

01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:07.025
And we're in your room
right now?

01:21:07.059 --> 01:21:09.061
You're a full grown-up.

01:21:09.094 --> 01:21:10.963
And you must be Cowboy.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.566
I guess I should thank you
for getting us out of there.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.668
Well, it was a team effort.

01:21:19.739 --> 01:21:21.206
- Tony.
- Uh...

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.274
Sagittarius.

01:21:22.307 --> 01:21:23.710
Ah. Well, you certainly

01:21:23.743 --> 01:21:26.311
must know your way
around a joystick, Tony.

01:21:32.084 --> 01:21:34.019
- You ready?
- Fully ready.

01:21:37.423 --> 01:21:38.957
The Captain Tony way.

01:21:40.225 --> 01:21:43.028
What? I-I miss the accent.

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:45.497
Oh, you were doing a...

01:21:45.532 --> 01:21:46.733
British accent?

01:21:46.766 --> 01:21:48.535
Hey. Hey, I'm good at it.

01:21:51.136 --> 01:21:52.705
One second.

01:21:55.708 --> 01:21:57.376
Sarah.

01:21:57.409 --> 01:21:59.044
Uh, guys!

01:21:59.077 --> 01:22:00.680
- Oh!
- Dad!

01:22:00.713 --> 01:22:02.682
What have I told you
about knocking?

01:22:02.715 --> 01:22:05.350
Sorry, sweetie. You guys ready?

01:22:05.384 --> 01:22:07.720
We don't want to be late
for the games convention.

01:22:07.754 --> 01:22:09.988
Okay. We're coming.

01:22:10.022 --> 01:22:12.324
We were just about to take
things to the next level.

01:22:12.357 --> 01:22:13.459
Excuse me?

01:22:13.492 --> 01:22:16.161
Uh, that's a games-related joke.

01:22:16.195 --> 01:22:18.430
I would never disrespect you
like that, Tony,

01:22:18.464 --> 01:22:20.232
you... you brilliant,
brilliant man.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.008
Do not fear!

01:28:36.042 --> 01:28:38.878
Max Cloud is here!
