WEBVTT

03:17.739 --> 03:20.491
We're getting several calls,
more than four shots heard…

03:20.575 --> 03:22.493
The shots were fired, and, uh…

03:22.577 --> 03:25.246
- They shot at you?
- They were shooting at me.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.041
I just ducked down in the seat thinking,
"Oh, my God."

03:28.124 --> 03:30.126
I don't even know if they hit the car.

03:39.594 --> 03:43.056
- What's the problem?
- The car came just barreling in.

03:43.139 --> 03:47.268
-It's a Honda Accord. And they came up--
- What color Honda?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.868
Someone's been shot
that's on the floor.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.620
It seems like she's not responding.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.038
Address is…

04:14.963 --> 04:18.132
RP's going to be responding.
It looks like we have a victim.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.387
Patrol, what's your twenty…?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.358
Riverside Police Department.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.034
- You didn't hear any gunshots?
- We were inside tonight.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.036
You didn't hear anything
or see anything?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.288
- I wasn't here.
- No, I was asleep.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.372
You were asleep?

10:27.585 --> 10:29.170
You didn't hear any gunshots?

10:29.253 --> 10:33.132
No. My wife said she heard,
you know, several pops, yeah.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.592
She didn't see anything?

11:50.668 --> 11:54.422
There's a lot of rumors running
around as to what might've happened.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.507
What are you thinking is…?

11:56.590 --> 12:02.179
I'm thinking there's been a lot
of gang problems with that, uh, 5150.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.452
Rival Latino and Black gangs
involved in drug trafficking…

14:04.093 --> 14:05.928
Give me a full description of this--

14:06.011 --> 14:09.056
He was young.
He was young. He was a kid.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.226
-But if I see him, I will know him.
- Okay.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.144
You doing okay, dude?

15:45.653 --> 15:46.904
I wasn't there.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.867
I know that you were, though.
I got somebody who identified you.

15:57.206 --> 16:02.002
We were at my house, and then we went
to his brother's girlfriend's house.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.143
Please!

16:21.105 --> 16:25.609
Let me go home!

19:06.603 --> 19:08.355
If you've got a teenager at home,

19:08.438 --> 19:10.774
chances are that he or she spends
a lot of time

19:10.858 --> 19:14.278
on the social networking website
called MySpace.com.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.789
With 66 million users nationwide,

19:25.873 --> 19:29.877
MySpace is one of the most popular
networking sites used by kids.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.171
Most of the kids at my school use MySpace.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.131
You put pictures up.
Meet girls, meet guys.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.289
Where was Robert
when this happened?

22:54.373 --> 22:57.209
Robert? I don't know.
Robert had nothing to do with this.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.835
Sure. Sure.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.890
You were not in an SUV that night?

24:34.973 --> 24:36.433
- No.
- Absolutely not?

24:36.516 --> 24:38.852
I can't tell you how many people
saw two SUVs that night.

24:38.935 --> 24:42.981
Realize, Robert, that I am here
to help your family.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.065
That's all our jobs.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.501
That white truck, was there
anything that stood out about it?

33:23.584 --> 33:27.505
Like, was it lowered, or have some kind
of special rims on it, anything at all?

33:27.588 --> 33:30.216
It was an Expedition.
I don't know what make that is.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.218
- Okay.
- If that's a Ford or what.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.666
Okay. All right, Will.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.337
We'll get you right back here
once we're all finished up.

34:52.381 --> 34:54.634
You're doing your GED.
I know what that means.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.595
-What are you doing as far as the cooking?
- Pantry cook.

35:00.139 --> 35:03.059
That's cool, man.
That's better than what you were doing.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.477
- Yeah.
- Big time.

35:07.438 --> 35:10.817
You wanted a water, didn't you?
See if you can get one for him?

35:11.692 --> 35:13.194
-Sorry about that.
- No problem.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.865
Your name has popped up in a case
that I'm working. Okay?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.075
-Case?
- Yeah.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.452
In an investigation that I'm doing.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.079
What is it? Gang members, or…?

35:23.162 --> 35:27.375
Well, it's got to do with 5150.
There's a girl that got shot.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.043
-Girl?
- Mm-hm.

35:30.211 --> 35:34.799
The thing that I need to ask you about,
though, is your… your car.

35:34.882 --> 35:38.886
Your Ford Expedition was identified
as being there.

35:39.512 --> 35:42.473
Was it mine?
With the license plates? I don't know.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.183
Yeah, your car was there.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.936
Uh-huh. When was this?

35:47.019 --> 35:48.229
Back in February.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.985
-Back in February?
- Mm-hm.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.027
I don't know.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.869
Yeah, you do, man.

36:17.675 --> 36:22.847
Nobody else in 5150 or anyone else around
in that area drives that car but you.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.975
Every time I talk about Jokes,
it's always that car.

36:26.058 --> 36:28.436
-Jokes? Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. That's you.

36:28.936 --> 36:32.982
Now is the time that you really need
to be straight up with me

36:33.065 --> 36:35.234
because I am your only ally right now.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.406
The problem is if you sit and tell me,
"I wasn't there…"

36:40.489 --> 36:42.700
All right, like, I'll say the truth, but--

36:42.783 --> 36:44.994
That's what I want you to tell me.
The truth.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.163
But I wasn't involved in it.
It just happened.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.332
Tell me. Tell me what happened.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.714
I don't know.
We were just cruising.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.507
Like, driving around by Rutland.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.968
Rutland Park?
Is that 5150 territory,

37:01.052 --> 37:03.054
or isn't that close to MD territory?

37:03.137 --> 37:05.056
Yes, that's MD's territory.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.308
And everybody's piled
into your Expedition?

37:07.391 --> 37:10.770
It was full,
probably like seven people in the car.

37:11.812 --> 37:14.649
Then this white Expedition passed quick,
almost hit my truck.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.734
He cuts us off, like, whoosh.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.237
Almost, like,
this close to hitting the truck.

37:26.118 --> 37:28.454
And then they started…

37:28.537 --> 37:31.999
The… The white Expedition started shooting
at the car, at my truck.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.043
- They shot at your truck?
- Yeah.

37:34.126 --> 37:37.255
I was gonna take off,
and Lil Huero's like, "Just stop."

37:37.338 --> 37:38.839
-He got out.
- Okay.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.549
So Little Huero gets out, right?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.221
Where did he walk to?
Did he walk toward--?

37:45.304 --> 37:48.432
I don't know. I started ducking.
There was bullets flying everywhere.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.729
That's pretty ballsy to get out
if somebody is shooting at you.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.690
Pretty ballsy to get out of the car.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.859
He's crazy. He's psycho. It's weird.

38:00.403 --> 38:03.364
What did you see in the car
with the girl inside when it went by?

38:03.447 --> 38:04.949
Did it look like it got hit?

38:05.032 --> 38:07.034
-Yeah, it did.
- It have bullet holes in it?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.828
No, like the window was shattered.

38:08.911 --> 38:10.079
Which window?

38:10.579 --> 38:13.874
The front… The front,
like, um, passenger side.

38:13.958 --> 38:19.380
Okay. And you said that you were
getting shot at? Did your car get hit?

38:19.463 --> 38:22.550
No. Um, I don't think it got hit.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.844
That's pretty close
for them not to hit you.

38:24.927 --> 38:27.346
-I'd have thought you've been hit.
-I don't know.

38:47.116 --> 38:49.243
Okay, when did you see Little Huero again?

38:49.368 --> 38:52.413
I never saw him. I never heard from him
or saw him again.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.414
- No?
-Mm-mm.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.392
Why don't we take a break?
Mind hanging out for a few minutes?

39:13.476 --> 39:15.186
-Okay.
- Okay, be right back.

39:16.979 --> 39:20.191
-Is this, like, all gonna stay here?
- What's that?

39:20.274 --> 39:22.693
Is anybody else going to find out
about this?

39:22.777 --> 39:25.571
- Am I gonna go run and tell?
-I don't wanna get killed.

39:25.654 --> 39:28.074
I ain't gonna tell Little Huero about it.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.971
-San Bernadino or--?
-Could you drop me off at Parkview?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.640
Parkview? I can do that.

42:17.993 --> 42:22.289
We lived very peacefully there.
Very peacefully.

42:22.373 --> 42:26.377
There were never any problems,
nothing, nothing.

42:27.336 --> 42:33.676
All those guys were his friends because
they were all from the same neighborhood.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.969
They were his friends.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.138
They seemed so innocent.

42:38.222 --> 42:42.393
They showed me respect.
They didn't use bad language.

42:43.686 --> 42:48.232
And I had no idea
what a big problem that was.

45:08.872 --> 45:11.500
I understand how the streets work.
You want to handle this.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.085
Your brothers want to handle this shit.

45:13.168 --> 45:15.254
-Enough harm's been done.
- Right.

45:15.337 --> 45:18.382
You don't need to go back to jail.
Your brothers don't need to.

45:18.465 --> 45:20.801
Your mom doesn't need
this kind of anguish, so…

45:32.229 --> 45:35.983
Are your sons, uh, wanting
to take care of this themselves?

45:36.066 --> 45:37.985
- No.
- No? Okay. Good.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.070
Yeah, we don't… We don't need that.

47:20.754 --> 47:23.382
Bangin' on the mic and shit, MySpace…

54:17.128 --> 54:18.421
There was a shooting.

54:19.381 --> 54:21.424
I don't know
if people were shooting at you.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.718
I don't know if you
were shooting somebody.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.428
If I was involved in a shooting,

54:25.512 --> 54:27.722
-I think they shot at us.
- I would remember.

54:37.732 --> 54:40.652
You told me you didn't
know anything, and you weren't in the car.

54:40.735 --> 54:42.112
Now I know that's all lies.

54:42.195 --> 54:44.572
'Cause you're telling me
that my brother's over here,

54:44.656 --> 54:46.032
then you let us talk a bit.

54:46.116 --> 54:49.327
Then he's coming telling me,
"You gotta tell them this and this."

54:49.411 --> 54:53.206
-"'Cause then he's gonna lock you up."
- He was being honest about it.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.042
He didn't hide anything.
He said, "Know what? I was there."

55:00.463 --> 55:04.009
- Is this the front of the car here?
-Yeah. This is the front of the car.

55:05.093 --> 55:05.927
Okay.

55:06.511 --> 55:10.682
This is me. This is my brother.
We're the only ones in the back.

55:10.765 --> 55:12.475
- You're in the very, very back?
-Yeah.

55:26.906 --> 55:30.744
He fired one kind of high,
and then he pointed at the car.

55:30.827 --> 55:32.495
-Yeah.
-Bam, bam, bam, bam.

55:32.579 --> 55:35.373
-And those hit the car.
-Those hit the car. Okay.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.721
Let's see if we can talk with him.

56:14.954 --> 56:16.748
The other way, you're lying to me.

56:16.831 --> 56:20.460
So you want to lie to me
in the middle of a murder investigation?

56:20.543 --> 56:21.878
Roll the dice.

56:21.961 --> 56:24.756
Or tell the truth,
and tell me what actually happened.

56:24.839 --> 56:28.593
-It doesn't get any more black and white.
-I know I didn't kill anybody.

56:28.676 --> 56:30.637
So, fine. Tell me what happened.

58:53.488 --> 58:55.823
Sir, what is your address, please?

58:55.907 --> 58:59.077
3445 Glasgow.

58:59.160 --> 59:01.246
A bunch of kids were dressed in black.

59:01.913 --> 59:05.291
Maybe they weren't kids. I couldn't tell
because they were so far away.

59:05.375 --> 59:08.378
Okay, and how many kids
are you talking about?

59:08.461 --> 59:10.004
About ten, 12.

59:10.088 --> 59:13.841
My husband called the police, and they
asked, "Are you going to stay there?"

59:18.263 --> 59:19.764
What is your name, sir?

59:19.847 --> 59:21.558
My name is William Lemus,

59:21.641 --> 59:23.977
but I do not want to get involved in this.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.979
You don't want the officer
to knock?

59:26.062 --> 59:26.980
Of course not.

59:27.063 --> 59:29.107
Because we were able to leave and we left.

59:29.190 --> 59:31.818
But we did not know
what they were going to do.

59:48.710 --> 59:50.461
All the sentimental things.

59:51.754 --> 59:54.674
But since I am Christian, the Bible says,

59:54.757 --> 59:57.510
"The thoughts of man
are not the same as those of God."

1:00:06.227 --> 1:00:09.564
All right, Manuel, your dad said
you wanna talk more?

1:00:09.647 --> 1:00:11.065
-Yeah.
- Okay. To remind you…

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:22.910
Do you remember
more of what happened that night?

1:00:24.287 --> 1:00:26.080
I can tell you the whole story now.

1:00:26.164 --> 1:00:26.998
Okay.

1:00:28.082 --> 1:00:30.627
The beginning was that, my friends,

1:00:30.710 --> 1:00:33.671
I don't know about what time,
late at night,

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:36.007
they came knocking at our house.

1:02:42.049 --> 1:02:44.135
- Out, like outside?
- Yeah.

1:02:44.927 --> 1:02:46.512
-Lil Huero.
- It's just Lil Huero?

1:02:46.596 --> 1:02:47.805
-Just him.
- Okay.

1:02:55.313 --> 1:02:58.524
I stood up, and I even turned around
so he could see from behind.

1:02:58.608 --> 1:02:59.609
I wasn't wearing a wire.

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:05.907
He would be on the passenger side,
but in the seat behind.

1:03:13.873 --> 1:03:16.042
Police Department! Search warrant!

1:03:19.921 --> 1:03:23.299
Police carried out a series
of gang association search warrants.

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:32.558
"This was a reign of terror,"
said the district attorney.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:34.894
"I think we took the gang apart
on Wednesday."

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.965
and a part of our community
and return it to the rightful owners.

1:04:14.684 --> 1:04:17.228
that eventually helped
lead police to arrests.

1:04:36.622 --> 1:04:39.000
You're looking at a murder charge,
and you're that…

1:04:39.083 --> 1:04:41.377
Are you that confident?
I'm looking at you.

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:42.920
I can tell you're not confident.

1:04:43.421 --> 1:04:46.257
No, I'm sure about this.
I'm thinking about other things.

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:48.509
What are you thinking about?
Thinking about Anna?

1:04:49.719 --> 1:04:51.429
-That kid she's carrying?
-Yup.

1:04:55.308 --> 1:04:58.060
Dude, there's a lot of stuff
going on in your life right now.

1:04:58.144 --> 1:04:59.562
How far along is she right now?

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:03.190
-Like, four months.
- Four months?

1:05:03.274 --> 1:05:05.484
-Little boy or little girl? Do you know?
-No.

1:05:06.485 --> 1:05:07.695
How is she doing?

1:05:08.487 --> 1:05:09.405
She's good.

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:14.911
You got a four-month-old on the way.

1:05:15.828 --> 1:05:18.998
Set the example and step up
and be a man about this.

1:05:20.124 --> 1:05:22.919
You made a mistake.
Everybody makes mistakes.

1:05:23.002 --> 1:05:24.837
Some of them are bigger than others.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:30.259
But right here, right now is the chance
for you to make a change.

1:05:31.469 --> 1:05:33.930
For you to be a different kind
of a person, Julio.

1:05:37.808 --> 1:05:39.644
You want to sleep on it tonight?

1:05:39.727 --> 1:05:42.730
No, I just want to…
Yeah, I want a freaking lawyer.

1:05:42.813 --> 1:05:46.067
I want you to give me my rights.
I want somebody to be right here.

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:49.487
So now you want a lawyer?
You can have an attorney if you want one.

1:05:49.570 --> 1:05:51.155
You wanna do that? That's fine.

1:05:52.156 --> 1:05:55.826
-But now you got a lot to think about.
-You don't understand me anyways.

1:12:20.252 --> 1:12:22.921
Who's that? You guys, get down!

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:26.633
I think they're coming up the road again.
Get behind the car, Ben. Hurry!

1:12:26.717 --> 1:12:29.636
Wait. Ma'am, hold on.
Do you think he was a teenager?

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:41.565
-He was shorter than me.
- Thin, medium, heavy build?

1:12:41.648 --> 1:12:43.817
Uh. He… uh… Very…

1:12:43.901 --> 1:12:45.152
Oh gosh, uh…

1:12:51.116 --> 1:12:54.870
My heart's still pounding. I'm just like,
"Oh my God. I can't believe this."

1:14:42.227 --> 1:14:45.731
By the time he hears the gunshot,
he comes outside of the car.

1:14:45.814 --> 1:14:46.899
He's coming out.

1:14:47.900 --> 1:14:52.654
And at this time,
I hear several other gunshot noises.

1:15:09.046 --> 1:15:10.964
You've seen Little Huero on meth?

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:13.091
- Yeah.
- You've never smoked with him?

1:15:13.175 --> 1:15:15.177
Never smoked with him,
never seen him do it,

1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:18.013
but I know he's on it
because of his eyeballs are all opened up.

1:15:28.023 --> 1:15:30.817
So I saw when Little Huero
dumped the first shot.

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:33.153
I didn't see the other shots.
I saw the first one.
