It’s like caging an animal.
You’re meant to run free, Booth.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.331
Look, I can’t be
in the field forever.
I mean, come on.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.632
I’ve got to think of other,
you know, important things.

There’s Christine, you know,

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m sure.

I mean, hey, this—
this is—

11:24.768 --> 11:27.885
this office stuff
is really interesting.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.471
Do you know how many
dry eraser markers...

in three months?

11:35.320 --> 11:38.107
How was the hotel
and the, uh, you know,
security tapes?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.813
Oh. Good. Yeah.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.490
Once the hotel found out
Franklin was a suspect,
they handed over everything.

11:42.578 --> 11:46.662
— Yeah. And?
- There are 83 cameras and
over 1,900 hours of footage.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.830
lt’s gonna take a while to go
through them, so I’m gonna—

11:48.917 --> 11:51.124
Booth was about to tell me
how many dry erase markers...

11:51.211 --> 11:53.293
the Bureau goes through
in a three—month period.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.291
- Why?
— Tell me about the security guy.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.590
He’s still in custody,
but we don’t have anything
on him yet.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.258
Did you know
that the Bureau...

12:00.345 --> 12:04.839
purchased 8,231 thumb drives
last quarter?

12:04.933 --> 12:06.389
- Bones.
- What’s going on here?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.683
— He told me that.
— Bones, let Sweets focus.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.681
- This is a very important case.
— Sure, sure.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.683
How is the new agent
you’re working with?

12:13.817 --> 12:15.728

along, you know.

in a suburb of Bethesda

— Thanks, Angela.

on the reconstruction—

12:40.761 --> 12:43.173
Right. And?
Anything else?

12:43.263 --> 12:46.175
Not yet. I’m gonna
go talk to his wife.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.757
— Sorry to run.
— Booth understands.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.638
Right.
Hey, hey.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.812
I understand.
I totally understand.
I’m cool.

He’s gonna be—
He’s gonna be great.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.818
You were very direct with
the desk clerk at the hotel,
and l was very impressed.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.566
I thought I might have
intimidated you.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.114
No. No way.
It was good.
It was good work.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.738
But notifying a woman
that her husband has died
is different.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.910
It requires, um,
a certain finesse,

13:09.039 --> 13:10.495
a delicate touch.

Are your bulletproof vests
classified as uniform

Yes. You wear it.

to sound weird to me.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.246
She thinks you’re an idiot?

15:24.341 --> 15:28.050

but, in layman’s terms,

15:28.136 --> 15:29.592
yes.

of this reconstruction,

15:59.126 --> 16:01.617
Oh. [ Scoffs ]
Then I’m totally blaming them.

16:01.711 --> 16:05.750

anomalies between the skull

have been discernible

And he’s dead now,
so now I’ll never get
a chance to meet him.

We’ll need the name
of the adoption agency.

I’ll get that for you.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.509
Who was he? I mean—

17:00.604 --> 17:03.471
What was his name?
Where did he live?
What was his job?

17:03.607 --> 17:06.644
That’s something I think you
might be able to help us with.
I don’t see how.

17:06.735 --> 17:09.272
There have been several
convincing studies...

17:09.362 --> 17:12.854
of identical twins,
like yourself, who were
separated as infants.

17:12.949 --> 17:16.407
As adults, they tend
to be remarkably similar.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.995
Are you serious
about this?

17:18.079 --> 17:21.321
This is sort
of my area, so—

17:21.416 --> 17:24.829
This would explain these
feelings I’ve always had
of not being... complete.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.462
Mm—hmm.
It’s strange.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.047
No, not at all.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.747
Separated twins often share
the same political views,

17:30.842 --> 17:34.676
work in similar occupations,
have the same behaviors,
needs and compulsions.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.550
You think you can figure out
who he was from who I am?

17:37.641 --> 17:40.257
I’m sure that’s
what Dr. Sweets hopes.

17:41.645 --> 17:45.479
I’ll have to ask my wife
how much I can tell you.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.305
She likes to have
the final say.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.267
Which may indicate
that your twin also entered
into a marriage...

17:50.362 --> 17:55.652
that was dominated
by... a—a deep sense
of mutual respect.

17:59.829 --> 18:03.162
I found some more remodeling,
aside from that on the face.

18:03.250 --> 18:07.869
Left ribs six and seven
and both first metacarpals...

18:07.963 --> 18:10.921
were all fractured
at approximately
the same time.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.838
Yes, | see.

18:12.926 --> 18:17.090

with a diameter
of 66 millimeters.

Very good, Dr. Saroyan.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.264
But something else
caused the fracturing
to the metacarpals.

His thumbs were slammed
in a drawer.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.268

But how would you know that?

18:29.359 --> 18:31.441

18:31.528 --> 18:33.439
Either a loan shark
or a bookie did this.

was late with a payment.

track down that explosive.

a cockroach egg.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.600
Yes. This particular
deformation is caused...

by exposure to large amounts
of hydroprene.

of hydroprene in the region.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.732
Studies
of separated twins...

19:20.827 --> 19:24.490
shows that they share
as much as 85% of key
behavioral characteristics.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.072
They cut their hair
the same way,
they eat the same food,

19:27.208 --> 19:30.075
they work in
the same occupations, they share
the same spiritual beliefs,

19:30.170 --> 19:31.831
and they’ve never
even met each other.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.537
Are you saying that parenting
doesn’t really matter?

19:34.632 --> 19:36.714
Because it’s a lot of work,
if that’s true.

19:36.801 --> 19:40.669
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You can’t— You can’t
discredit good nurture.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.597
But as the study shows,
nature counts for a lot.

19:43.725 --> 19:47.468
So what do you think?
Oh, I’m just waiting for a hit
from the adoption agency.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.598
We got a court order to get
their records unsealed.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.853
Yeah, Agent Sparling doesn’t see
the value in my approach.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.527
Oh. Okay.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.276
Well, I input
the key data points
that you gave me...

20:00.367 --> 20:05.361
so I could cross—reference
Carlson’s specific traits
across multiple databases.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.116
So we start big, right?

figured that out. Never mind.

20:33.775 --> 20:38.644
Okay, this is where all
the specific data that Sweets
got from Carlson comes in.

good specific data
that you got, by the way.

Way to go, Sweets.

21:34.169 --> 21:38.162
Are you working some sort
of psychological mojo on me?

21:38.923 --> 21:40.754
No. Why do you ask?

21:42.093 --> 21:43.833

33:05.985 --> 33:09.443
That’s to be expected
based on the force
of the explosion.

a warp to it.

Oh. Run your beam
over it again.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.958
He was standing here
when the shock wave hit him.

33:24.044 --> 33:28.333
These dents were most likely
caused by an impact
with his skull.

33:28.424 --> 33:33.293
Probably with the lateral aspect
of the supraorbital margin
and the zygomatic arch.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.378
Yeah.
Can you hold that?

33:39.852 --> 33:42.764
Midpoint
is at 160 centimeters,

33:42.855 --> 33:46.814
which means our killer
is between 5 foot 9
and 5 foot 11 inches tall.

Average height.
That’s no help.

sustained further injuries
from this blast.

to get away.

dumped all this stuff on me.

to tie you to this murder.

Now, it’s not too late
for you to do the right thing.

34:54.176 --> 34:58.419
The right thing?
Robert wanted to give
that stupid cult everything.

How is that the right thing?
What was gonna happen to me?

35:01.684 --> 35:04.266
He just
kept saying he wanted
to experience freedom...

35:04.353 --> 35:06.890
and that he didn’t care
how much it cost.

35:06.981 --> 35:09.188
You wound up killing
an innocent man.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.765
That wasn’t my fault.

How is that my fault?

notice about him?
No, I—I never met him.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.113
This was all set up online.

half up front and half
when the job was done.

the second half?
No!

Oh, uh, he was hurt.
He hit a steel junction box.

was at least 40 psi.
