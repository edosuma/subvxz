WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.334
Good morning, Sabrina.

00:03.436 --> 00:04.302
Morning.

00:04.336 --> 00:05.170
What'll it be?

00:05.237 --> 00:06.771
Egg white omelet or oatmeal?

00:06.806 --> 00:07.606
(screams)

00:07.705 --> 00:09.808
Okay, you can have a Pop-Tart.

00:09.842 --> 00:13.077
No. It's your faces--
you all have Harvey's face.

00:13.145 --> 00:14.746
Even the cat.

00:14.747 --> 00:17.783
I <i>am</i> Harvey...
and I need 20 bucks.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.985
I'm attracted to all of you,
yet I'm repulsed.

00:20.052 --> 00:21.186
Oh, make it stop.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.353
Oh, honey,

00:22.421 --> 00:24.422
sometimes when a witch
really loves someone

00:24.490 --> 00:25.990
and can't stop
thinking about them

00:26.058 --> 00:28.426
they literally see the
object of their affection

00:28.494 --> 00:29.794
in other people's faces.

00:29.795 --> 00:32.030
Yeah. It happens to me
all the time.

00:33.165 --> 00:34.199
Hi, baby.

00:34.266 --> 00:35.266
Help.

00:35.367 --> 00:36.802
All you have to do
to make it stop

00:36.869 --> 00:39.004
is say out loud
how you feel about Harvey.

00:39.105 --> 00:42.039
I really love and miss Harvey.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.275
SABRINA:
Ah, much better.

01:18.143 --> 01:19.810
You want my mayonnaise?
Nah.

01:19.878 --> 01:21.078
Harvey would have.

01:21.146 --> 01:22.913
He always liked my condiments.

01:22.981 --> 01:24.882
Sometimes
he'd even eat my garnish.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.751
Oh, just take it.

01:26.818 --> 01:28.953
There's Harvey.

01:29.021 --> 01:30.054
No Colette.

01:30.122 --> 01:31.022
Go talk to him.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.390
All right, I'm going.

01:33.592 --> 01:35.060
Hi.

01:35.127 --> 01:36.761
Hi.

01:36.829 --> 01:39.464
So, how have you been?

01:39.532 --> 01:40.899
Hi, guys.

01:40.966 --> 01:42.633
Oh, Harvey,
you left your chemistry book.

01:42.701 --> 01:43.969
You forgot it
in my locker.

01:44.036 --> 01:45.303
Oops.

01:45.371 --> 01:46.571
I forgot napkins.

01:46.638 --> 01:48.439
Oh, you're sharing lockers now?

01:48.507 --> 01:51.042
Well, I got a new plant.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.777
A green one?

01:54.380 --> 01:55.980
Oh, Harvey, my mom wants to know

01:56.048 --> 01:59.016
if you could bring a pumpkin pie
to Thanksgiving dinner.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.352
But we always have
Thanksgiving at your...

02:01.420 --> 02:03.154
It's a philodendron. Excuse me.

02:03.222 --> 02:04.322
Can I have your mayonnaise?

02:04.390 --> 02:05.623
Sure.

02:08.894 --> 02:11.295
Sabrina, shouldn't
you be in school?

02:11.363 --> 02:12.763
Oh, I just slipped away to shop.

02:12.831 --> 02:15.099
You know, I've always wanted
a fine timepiece.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.968
What happened
with Harvey now?

02:17.036 --> 02:19.404
He's going to go to Colette's
for Thanksgiving.

02:19.505 --> 02:21.039
I always went to his house.

02:21.073 --> 02:23.708
Now where will I go?
What will become of me?

02:23.776 --> 02:25.076
But I thought you always said

02:25.143 --> 02:27.478
Mrs. Kinkle's stuffing
tasted like lumpy spackle.

02:27.546 --> 02:30.282
Yes, but with gravy and Harvey,
it was pretty good.

02:30.382 --> 02:32.250
How could I have been so stupid?

02:32.318 --> 02:34.185
I wish I had never kissed Josh.

02:34.253 --> 02:37.655
I know. I wish I had
never kissed Estes Kefauver.

02:37.723 --> 02:40.591
I wish things weren't
so messed up with me and Harvey.

02:40.659 --> 02:42.727
It may not be
over between you.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.596
Sometimes people
just need

02:44.663 --> 02:46.298
a little time apart.

02:46.365 --> 02:47.999
Try to remember,
whatever happens

02:48.067 --> 02:49.967
if it was meant to be,
it will be.

02:50.035 --> 02:51.836
And everything happens
for a reason.

02:51.903 --> 02:53.204
And safety first.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.342
Okay, I need to work
on my clichés.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.112
One decaf cappuccino
coming right up.

03:16.595 --> 03:20.732
¶ Love lift us up
where we belong ¶

03:22.835 --> 03:26.304
¶ Where the eagles cry... ¶

03:26.372 --> 03:28.840
(machine gurgling)

03:33.378 --> 03:35.947
Uh, this is
our new drink--

03:36.014 --> 03:37.782
the, um, foam-uccino.

03:40.452 --> 03:43.020
Harvey, I was just...
not thinking about you.

03:43.088 --> 03:46.491
Hey, listen,
uh, we need to talk.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.124
Really?

03:47.192 --> 03:48.192
Yeah, but...

03:48.260 --> 03:49.493
it's pretty busy in here.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.029
Maybe it's not a good time.

03:51.096 --> 03:51.862
No...

03:53.699 --> 03:56.568
Guess I didn't hear
the ice cream truck.

03:56.635 --> 03:58.302
So, what did you want
to talk about?

03:58.370 --> 04:01.438
Well, last night I was looking
at all this stuff that I have

04:01.506 --> 04:03.040
that reminds me of you.

04:03.108 --> 04:05.009
You were? I was, too.

04:05.077 --> 04:06.911
So you agree that,
now that we're broken up,

04:06.979 --> 04:09.313
we should give all that stuff
back to each other?

04:09.381 --> 04:11.449
Absolutely.

04:11.517 --> 04:14.185
That's...
just what I was thinking.

04:16.188 --> 04:17.422
Well, look at the crowd.

04:17.488 --> 04:18.857
I should get back to work.

04:18.923 --> 04:21.125
Hey, aren't those the people
that just left?

04:21.192 --> 04:24.962
They check out the competition;
they always come back.

04:25.030 --> 04:26.497
(sobbing)

04:26.565 --> 04:28.832
His letterman's jacket...

04:28.900 --> 04:30.301
pictures...
(sobbing): No...

04:30.368 --> 04:32.837
the hat he made me
in wood shop...

04:32.905 --> 04:34.372
Please, just talk to him.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.641
He's good people.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.610
He's moved on.
<i>We've</i> moved on.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.512
There's nothing left
to talk about.

04:40.579 --> 04:41.713
You want me to talk to him?

04:41.781 --> 04:45.316
No. Harvey's just not
the right guy for me.

04:45.384 --> 04:47.218
Oh, so you still
want to date Josh.

04:47.285 --> 04:48.753
No, but the whole thing
with Josh

04:48.821 --> 04:50.088
made me realize that...

04:50.155 --> 04:52.023
well, what I want
is a college guy.

04:52.091 --> 04:53.291
Yeah, a college guy.

04:53.358 --> 04:55.293
Yeah, somebody cool
and... ptth!

04:55.360 --> 04:57.395
Harvey's just not that cool.

04:57.462 --> 04:59.697
I always thought
I'd be Harvey's best man

04:59.765 --> 05:01.099
at your wedding.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.333
(knocking on door)

05:02.401 --> 05:05.636
SALEM:
Hilda, Zelda,
it's so sad.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.438
We have a surprise.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.574
We're going to cook
Thanksgiving dinner.

05:09.641 --> 05:11.642
Turkey, stuffing and gravy?
Lots of gravy?

05:11.710 --> 05:14.312
Wow. You guys have
never celebrated
Thanksgiving before.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.681
Well, we've decided
to put our hard feelings

05:16.682 --> 05:20.151
towards those poopie old
witch-hating pilgrims aside.

05:20.218 --> 05:22.721
Now, Hilda, we realized
that it was more important

05:22.788 --> 05:25.456
to cheer up someone we love
than to hold a grudge...

05:25.524 --> 05:27.759
against those
poopie old pilgrims.

05:27.826 --> 05:29.494
You guys are the best.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.894
We're doing this
for Sabrina.

05:30.962 --> 05:32.596
If it involves gravy,
you can do it

05:32.664 --> 05:34.298
for Moms Mabley,
for all I care.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.603
Well, here's your stuff.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.571
Yeah, here's yours.

05:40.639 --> 05:44.508
Aw, my Hootie and
the Blowfish CD.

05:44.576 --> 05:46.110
Oh...

05:46.145 --> 05:47.979
Here's your lip gloss.

05:48.046 --> 05:52.116
Guess my books won't smell
like strawberry swirl anymore.

05:52.184 --> 05:53.184
Thanks.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.887
Well... I guess
that's everything.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.990
Yep. So...

05:59.058 --> 06:00.524
See ya.

06:00.592 --> 06:03.193
Yeah. See ya.

06:03.261 --> 06:05.829
Bye.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.534
Bye.

06:18.510 --> 06:21.646
I can't believe
it wasn't meant to be.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.455
He's keeping her picture.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.390
(in Valley talk):
So, guy, Dreama

06:32.458 --> 06:35.192
I can't believe
he actually kept her picture.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.461
(both squealing with laughter)

06:37.529 --> 06:38.996
That means
he totally still likes her.

06:39.064 --> 06:41.632
But Sabrina doesn't think
Harvey's cool enough.

06:41.700 --> 06:45.069
Please, she's my friend,
but she just doesn't get it.

06:45.137 --> 06:46.938
Don't tell her I said that.

06:47.005 --> 06:47.939
Girlfriend,

06:48.006 --> 06:49.007
it's up to you.

06:49.107 --> 06:51.175
Put a magic thermometer spell
on Harvey

06:51.243 --> 06:53.244
and make him cool.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.178
I'll do it.

06:56.181 --> 06:59.183
Not before you rinse me. God.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.617
"Reach hand in cavity.

07:00.685 --> 07:04.155
Loosen and remove
giblets and gizzard."

07:04.222 --> 07:05.557
Go ahead, Zellie.

07:05.624 --> 07:06.824
<i>You</i> go ahead.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.326
I unwrapped the foul fowl.

07:08.393 --> 07:10.294
Well, who came up
with this stupid rule

07:10.362 --> 07:13.097
that witches have to make
Thanksgiving dinner by hand?

07:13.165 --> 07:14.298
Stupid witches.

07:14.366 --> 07:16.100
They're just trying
to discourage us

07:16.168 --> 07:17.635
from celebrating
Thanksgiving.

07:17.703 --> 07:18.970
Well, it's working.

07:19.037 --> 07:22.774
Oh, come on, we have
to do this for Sabrina.

07:22.841 --> 07:25.109
Let's just leave
the gizzard, hmm?

07:25.177 --> 07:26.778
What's next?

07:26.845 --> 07:29.147
"Salt and pepper to taste."

07:29.214 --> 07:31.749
This is hard.

07:34.152 --> 07:35.586
Okay, Harvey, be cool.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.632
(bell ringing)

07:47.699 --> 07:50.468
I am so out of here.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.872
Cool.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.007
Sabrina, you have
to talk to Harvey.

07:57.075 --> 07:58.543
Oh, man, you're like
a dog with a bone.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.044
Listen, Harvey and I
have given back

08:00.111 --> 08:01.211
all our relationship stuff.

08:01.279 --> 08:02.513
We have closure.
But trust me--

08:02.581 --> 08:03.681
Harvey's really changed.

08:03.749 --> 08:04.648
We have closure.

08:04.716 --> 08:06.417
Then why did he keep
a picture of you

08:06.485 --> 08:07.685
in his locker?

08:07.752 --> 08:09.486
Closure.
He kept my picture?

08:09.554 --> 08:11.922
Did I also win a Nobel prize
you didn't tell me about?

08:11.990 --> 08:13.190
I've got to talk to him.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.693
Oh. Hey, Harvey.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.695
Yo, 'Brina.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.930
'Brina?

08:18.931 --> 08:21.131
Look, um, do you
think we could talk?

08:21.199 --> 08:23.100
What do you call
what we're doing right now?

08:23.168 --> 08:25.503
(cell phone ringing)

08:25.571 --> 08:27.738
It's the Kink-Man.

08:27.806 --> 08:30.208
Harvey just blew me off.

08:30.275 --> 08:31.942
But isn't he cool?

08:32.010 --> 08:34.078
Oh, are you responsible
for the rebel without a clue?

08:34.145 --> 08:36.748
I guess, but I thought you
wanted him to be different.

08:36.815 --> 08:38.049
No, I was just rationalizing

08:38.116 --> 08:39.717
to get through this
lonely, desperate time.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.119
Oh.

08:42.187 --> 08:43.754
Ay!

08:45.991 --> 08:46.857
You've got to stop him

08:46.925 --> 08:48.526
before he starts
looking for Potsie.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.662
Okay, okay,
I'll warm him up.

08:54.599 --> 08:57.301
I don't want
no stinking fish sticks.

08:57.369 --> 08:59.570
Too hot. Too hot. You've
turned him into a hothead.

08:59.638 --> 09:00.704
Hey.

09:00.772 --> 09:02.940
What are you looking at,
freckle boy?!

09:03.007 --> 09:05.009
Oh, it's time I take
matters in my own finger.

09:06.945 --> 09:09.480
Wait, Clarence.

09:09.547 --> 09:11.382
You dropped your Pokemon cards.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.883
There. Perfect temperature.

09:12.951 --> 09:14.752
Hi, Harvey.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.154
Oh, hi, Colette.

09:16.221 --> 09:18.522
Mind if I walk you
to class?

09:21.192 --> 09:23.194
I'm so glad I arranged
that for her.

09:23.261 --> 09:25.062
These recipes
are so involved.

09:25.130 --> 09:28.499
Why don't we make
our own traditional
Thanksgiving foods?

09:28.567 --> 09:29.867
Great idea.

09:29.935 --> 09:31.269
How about microwave popcorn?

09:31.336 --> 09:33.036
Yes, and we'll put it
in a casserole

09:33.104 --> 09:35.506
and melt miniature marshmallows
on top of it.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.208
It's too bad
you're being sarcastic

09:37.275 --> 09:38.976
because that sounds
kind of good.

09:39.044 --> 09:40.244
Okay, lunch is almost over,

09:40.312 --> 09:42.413
so I don't have much time,
but I was wondering

09:42.481 --> 09:44.715
if you knew
of a "fix a broken love" spell?

09:44.782 --> 09:45.983
Oh, sure, honey--
it's filed

09:46.051 --> 09:48.185
right next to the "make
life perfect" spell.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.620
Oh, I could use that, too.

09:49.688 --> 09:51.855
Sabrina, you know you
can't use magic for love.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.491
Oh, what <i>can</i> I use magic for?

09:53.592 --> 09:54.859
Trust me--

09:54.926 --> 09:55.994
in matters of the heart,

09:56.061 --> 09:57.829
the mortal way
is the magic way.

09:57.896 --> 09:59.997
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:00.065 --> 10:02.967
It's always so satisfying
when I get through to her.

10:03.034 --> 10:06.003
Check this out
in the witch's cookbook.

10:06.071 --> 10:08.339
"Have a homemade traditional
Thanksgiving dinner

10:08.407 --> 10:10.608
with all the fixings,
in just one easy step."

10:13.879 --> 10:15.245
ZELDA:
Wonderful.

10:15.313 --> 10:17.215
We'll have an authentic
Thanksgiving dinner

10:17.282 --> 10:19.751
made by hand--
just not our hands.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.689
Okay, Harvey, we need to talk.

10:25.757 --> 10:28.626
Hey, Colette,
we need to talk.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.628
Sure. What is it?

10:32.163 --> 10:33.831
You're really nice

10:33.899 --> 10:35.899
but this relationship
doesn't feel

10:35.967 --> 10:38.035
that comfortable to me,

10:38.102 --> 10:39.437
and I think it'd be better

10:39.504 --> 10:41.204
if we stopped
seeing each other.

10:41.272 --> 10:42.606
(quietly):
Yes!

10:42.674 --> 10:44.008
You're breaking up with me

10:44.076 --> 10:46.443
so you can get back
with Sabrina, aren't you?

10:46.511 --> 10:48.179
Yes.

10:48.246 --> 10:49.046
It's not that.

10:49.113 --> 10:50.447
I mean...

10:50.515 --> 10:52.383
I still love
and care about her

10:52.450 --> 10:54.918
but I don't know
if I can ever forgive Sabrina

10:54.987 --> 10:56.353
for what she did.

10:56.421 --> 10:58.189
(whimpers):
No.

11:03.595 --> 11:06.129
If you want him to
forgive you, just
say you're sorry.

11:06.197 --> 11:07.465
Look, I totally betrayed him.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.433
I can't walk up
to him and say, "Sorry!"

11:09.501 --> 11:11.836
But if you..
No, you don't
know how he said it.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.404
I'll just show you.

11:17.909 --> 11:20.844
(audio rewinding)

11:20.912 --> 11:22.846
I don't know
if I can ever forgive Sabrina

11:22.914 --> 11:23.981
for what she did.

11:24.049 --> 11:25.349
Ouch.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.585
Harvey's never said
anything like that before.

11:27.652 --> 11:29.787
HARVEY:
Colette, I never meant
to hurt you.

11:29.854 --> 11:31.322
Oh, I really need
to remember

11:31.390 --> 11:33.824
to turn off my radio soaps.

11:33.892 --> 11:35.393
(projection screen
retracts, flutters)

11:35.460 --> 11:36.927
I hope our
kitchen meets

11:36.995 --> 11:38.629
all your
culinary needs.

11:38.696 --> 11:40.797
Mother, my eyes vex me.

11:40.865 --> 11:42.366
We should never
have partaken

11:42.434 --> 11:43.634
of that evil weed.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.703
Yes. Wretched tobacco!

11:45.770 --> 11:46.637
Now don't be vexed.

11:46.705 --> 11:47.672
How about

11:47.740 --> 11:51.542
I get some <i>tea</i> for <i>thee?</i>

11:51.610 --> 11:53.744
The mortal way--
they're pilgrims.

11:53.811 --> 11:55.246
Of course.

11:55.313 --> 11:58.182
Hot tea coming right up.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.518
(microwave humming)

12:00.585 --> 12:01.184
Witch!
Witch!

12:01.252 --> 12:02.419
Witch!
Witch!

12:02.487 --> 12:03.454
They don't exactly

12:03.521 --> 12:05.089
think outside of
the box, do they?

12:05.157 --> 12:07.859
There's got to be a spell
to make Harvey forgive me.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.394
Sabrina, maybe you should
listen to your aunts' advice:

12:10.461 --> 12:12.229
The mortal way is the magic way.

12:12.297 --> 12:13.664
Here's one:
"If you've done something wrong

12:13.731 --> 12:14.732
"in a relationship,
start over

12:14.800 --> 12:16.500
by going back
to the drawing board."

12:19.504 --> 12:21.138
Or you could
just ignore the cat.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.473
Okay, now,
all I need to do is

12:22.541 --> 12:24.675
fill in our thought bubbles
with what I want us to say.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.244
Let's see, I'll say,
"Can you forgive and forget?"

12:27.312 --> 12:30.381
And Harvey'll say,
"All is forgiven and forgotten."

12:33.818 --> 12:35.719
Now, we'll all live
happily ever after.

12:40.291 --> 12:41.792
Wish me luck.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.760
Hey, you should try to get
on <i>The Simpsons.</i>

12:46.465 --> 12:49.266
Harvey, can you
forgive and forget?

12:49.333 --> 12:52.336
All is forgiven
and forgotten.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.672
I'm sorry. I forgot.

12:54.739 --> 12:56.073
You are...?

12:56.141 --> 12:57.375
Sabrina.

12:57.442 --> 12:58.643
And I am...?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.781
Okay, back
to the drawing board.

13:03.848 --> 13:04.915
Let's see.

13:04.983 --> 13:08.219
To err is human,
to forgive divine.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.556
This one'll work.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.961
So, to err is human.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.665
Why these fish sticks
are simply divine.

13:20.732 --> 13:22.466
I must forgive the lunch lady

13:22.534 --> 13:25.302
for wreaking havoc
with my waistline.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.171
Sabrina...

13:27.239 --> 13:30.174
your outfit, <i>divine.</i>

13:33.478 --> 13:35.012
Okay, apparently,
with this board

13:35.080 --> 13:37.247
you have to choose
your words very carefully.

13:37.315 --> 13:39.883
So something simple
and heartfelt.

13:39.951 --> 13:42.886
"Harvey, let go and let God."

13:47.325 --> 13:48.892
Yes, my child?

13:48.960 --> 13:49.393
Shoot!

13:49.461 --> 13:51.228
Sorry, Father.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.698
Okay, I got
the perfect idea.

14:00.671 --> 14:01.872
Hey!

14:01.940 --> 14:03.140
I was going to use that board

14:03.208 --> 14:07.444
to mend the rift between me
and Yvonne de Carlo.

14:07.512 --> 14:09.045
John, Mary,

14:09.113 --> 14:11.348
aren't we overreacting
just a bit?

14:11.416 --> 14:12.783
You're witches. Admit it.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.986
All right, if you insist.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.188
Oh, merciful heavens!

14:18.256 --> 14:19.523
Oh, you know, for people

14:19.591 --> 14:21.258
who crossed the Atlantic
and fought Indians,

14:21.326 --> 14:22.993
you're kind of fraidy cats.
Come on now.

14:23.061 --> 14:25.696
We just need you
to make Thanksgiving dinner.

14:25.763 --> 14:27.598
It would mean so
much to our niece.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.301
So if we prepare a feast
for you, you'll send us home?

14:30.368 --> 14:32.503
Quicker than you
can say "cornucopia."

14:32.571 --> 14:35.038
Aunt Hilda and Zelda,
I really need to
talk to you...

14:35.106 --> 14:37.040
away from Mr. and
Mrs. Quaker Oats.

14:37.108 --> 14:39.009
Wait. Somebody has
to watch the pilgrims.

14:41.813 --> 14:43.246
Witch! Witch!
Witch! Witch!

14:43.314 --> 14:44.748
Pilgrim! Pilgrim!

14:44.815 --> 14:47.951
John, Mary, this is our very
friendly talking cat, Salem.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.587
He'll help you get started.

14:49.654 --> 14:52.223
If he tries to repress
your freedom of religion,

14:52.290 --> 14:54.658
just spray him
with a water bottle.

14:54.726 --> 14:57.227
I just realized
that I can't use a spell

14:57.295 --> 14:58.762
to make Harvey forgive me.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.564
Oh, so you're going to try it
the mortal way?

15:00.631 --> 15:01.765
No. I wanted to know

15:01.833 --> 15:03.700
if I could borrow
your magic lost in time clock?

15:03.768 --> 15:05.269
You have to admit,
she's tenacious.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.305
I just want to go back
to that night on the porch.

15:07.372 --> 15:08.973
I won't kiss Josh,
and Harvey won't be hurt.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.374
Please? I really need
a second chance.

15:11.643 --> 15:14.645
I am the most powerful
of all witches,

15:14.712 --> 15:16.914
and I will only
be appeased by gravy.

15:16.981 --> 15:19.183
Stir faster or I'll
turn you into toads.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.650
Unleash not your anger!

15:20.718 --> 15:21.852
We stir, sir!

15:21.920 --> 15:24.355
Well, I'm off
to right a wrong.

15:24.422 --> 15:25.355
Now... how do I do this?

15:25.423 --> 15:27.391
You make a left turn
at "yesterday"

15:27.459 --> 15:29.660
and then go forward
toward "the past."

15:29.727 --> 15:32.195
Okay, if you need me, I'll be
on our porch two weeks ago.

15:32.263 --> 15:34.165
Good luck.

15:34.232 --> 15:36.567
Well, I guess,
while we're waiting,

15:36.635 --> 15:38.335
I could take a look
at your bookkeeping.

15:38.402 --> 15:39.737
What bookkeeping?

15:41.906 --> 15:43.207
Cool.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.775
Oh, so, um,
what was I saying?

15:44.842 --> 15:46.610
If everyone would
just buy a goat

15:46.678 --> 15:48.445
then we could eliminate
leaf blowers

15:48.513 --> 15:50.080
and stop global warming.

15:50.148 --> 15:51.648
Well, here we are.

15:51.716 --> 15:53.117
Oh, thanks
for helping me study.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.686
You're welcome. And
you can admit I'm right

15:55.754 --> 15:57.621
about the goat
thing later.

15:57.688 --> 15:59.089
Sorry, Josh, but I have

15:59.157 --> 16:00.691
a really wonderful
boyfriend Harvey

16:00.759 --> 16:03.093
and, if I kiss you,
then that'll hurt Harvey

16:03.161 --> 16:05.696
and that would ruin our
relationship forever.

16:05.763 --> 16:08.165
Well I wouldn't want you to do
anything you may later regret.

16:08.233 --> 16:11.435
Thank you for being
so understanding.

16:11.503 --> 16:14.071
You don't look sick to me.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.906
Harvey, wait!

16:15.973 --> 16:19.276
I'm rewriting
history here!

16:20.479 --> 16:22.345
This stupid
clock is broken.

16:22.413 --> 16:24.982
I went back in time, and it
still ruined things with Harvey.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.951
Oh, honey, when the
past refuses to change

16:27.018 --> 16:29.186
it means what happened
was meant to be.

16:29.253 --> 16:30.354
Why would that
be meant to be?

16:30.422 --> 16:31.921
What good could
possibly come of this?

16:31.989 --> 16:33.923
We never said something good
would come of it.

16:33.991 --> 16:37.327
So it's really over
between Harvey and me?

16:37.395 --> 16:38.762
Aw. You okay?

16:38.830 --> 16:40.630
Yeah. I'm fine.

16:40.698 --> 16:44.000
Just going to do some stuff
on my school paper

16:44.069 --> 16:46.136
and bury myself in my work.

16:46.204 --> 16:47.704
I don't need love.

16:49.941 --> 16:52.376
I hope
she still needs turkey.

16:52.444 --> 16:53.877
Oh, right, turkey.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.513
I wonder how Salem's doing
with those pilgrims.

16:56.581 --> 16:58.716
I <i>must</i> taste everything.

16:58.783 --> 17:00.184
Nothing leaves this kitchen

17:00.251 --> 17:02.052
until it passes my lips.

17:02.120 --> 17:02.719
Mm.

17:02.787 --> 17:05.355
Ooh, too spicy.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.359
(grunts):
Too bland.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.864
Eh! Not just right.

17:13.932 --> 17:18.669
Need I remind you of the penalty
for displeasing me... <i>toads?</i>

17:18.737 --> 17:19.869
Then be done with it.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.005
We prefer that
to this oppression.

17:22.073 --> 17:24.406
Go ahead. Use
your magic, witch.

17:24.474 --> 17:25.742
Uh-oh.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.010
(Sobbing)

17:27.078 --> 17:28.779
you don't want to cook <i>me.</i>

17:28.847 --> 17:30.280
I'm awful gamey.

17:30.348 --> 17:31.415
Okay.

17:31.482 --> 17:32.949
Uh, this is not
how we left things.

17:33.017 --> 17:34.451
He is an abomination.

17:34.518 --> 17:36.553
Oh, so you've had time
to get to know each other.

17:36.621 --> 17:38.655
More importantly,
how's the meal coming?

17:38.723 --> 17:40.924
Hear ye, hear ye-- we quit.

17:40.991 --> 17:43.560
Wait. Um, look

17:43.628 --> 17:44.828
maybe we've
asked of you

17:44.896 --> 17:46.696
without giving
anything in return.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.566
Yeah, if you cook for us,
we'll zap you anything you want.

17:49.634 --> 17:51.268
A new horse? A winter coat?

17:52.570 --> 17:53.437
(horse sputters)

17:53.505 --> 17:55.205
Witch! Witch!
Witch! Witch!

17:55.273 --> 17:57.975
Yes, we've established
that we're witches.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.177
So, do we have a deal?

18:00.244 --> 18:01.545
Good wife

18:01.613 --> 18:04.448
look at the strong haunches
on that horse.

18:07.585 --> 18:08.985
You know...

18:09.053 --> 18:11.021
we <i>could</i> use
a new feather bed.

18:11.088 --> 18:12.589
And a bed warmer.

18:12.657 --> 18:15.459
I want a real pewter one--
like the Joneses next door.

18:15.527 --> 18:16.860
Awfully greedy for Puritans.

18:16.927 --> 18:19.763
We'll give you whatever
you want; just cook.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.366
This shall be a Thanksgiving
like no other.

18:22.433 --> 18:23.267
ZELDA:
Absolutely.

18:23.334 --> 18:25.903
No dysentery this time.

18:25.970 --> 18:28.171
Okay, we'll get
out of your way.

18:28.239 --> 18:31.942
Hey, isn't someone going
to untie the cat?

18:34.379 --> 18:36.080
Oh, sorry.

18:36.147 --> 18:37.548
Are you... sorry?

18:37.615 --> 18:39.116
Yes, very.

18:39.183 --> 18:41.751
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

18:41.819 --> 18:43.353
I'm so glad to say I'm sorry.

18:43.421 --> 18:45.956
I'm sorry I didn't say
I was sorry sooner.

18:46.023 --> 18:48.159
But I'm sorry.
None of this would have happened

18:48.226 --> 18:49.926
if I hadn't taken you
for granted

18:49.994 --> 18:52.095
and spent all my time
with brad and the guys.

18:52.163 --> 18:54.064
I'm sorry I thought
I wanted to date Josh.

18:54.131 --> 18:55.266
I'm sorry I dated Josh.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.867
I'm sorry to keep
bringing it up.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.136
And I'm sorry for saying
I'd call at 8:15,

18:59.204 --> 19:00.971
but I didn't call till 8:20.

19:01.039 --> 19:03.407
And I'm sorry I ate
the last Milk Dud
at the movies.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.142
Boy, I've really missed you.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.210
I've missed you too.

19:06.277 --> 19:07.778
You know...

19:07.845 --> 19:09.780
I thought I couldn't
forgive you,

19:09.848 --> 19:12.916
but sometimes I feel
like I'm under your spell.

19:19.524 --> 19:21.158
I guess sometimes
the mortal way

19:21.226 --> 19:22.493
<i>is</i> the magic way.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.594
What?!

19:23.661 --> 19:25.728
You don't have
to agree with me.

19:25.796 --> 19:28.165
So, um, do you want to come over
for a traditional Thanksgiving?

19:28.232 --> 19:30.801
I thought your aunts don't cook
Thanksgiving dinner.

19:30.868 --> 19:33.537
Well, that's the tradition.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.839
So, will you do
me the honor

19:35.907 --> 19:37.608
of taking back
all of my junk?

19:37.676 --> 19:39.142
If you'll take mine.

19:41.212 --> 19:42.312
Hey!

19:42.379 --> 19:43.881
You varnished it.

19:43.948 --> 19:46.816
Yeah, my dad sprayed
it, so no termites.

19:48.352 --> 19:50.153
I thought
up another way

19:50.221 --> 19:52.689
for you and Harvey
to get back together.

19:52.757 --> 19:53.890
Never mind.

19:53.958 --> 19:56.026
I knew there was someone
I was supposed to call.

19:57.495 --> 19:59.863
Thanksgiving dinner
is served.

19:59.931 --> 20:01.197
Oh boy.

20:01.265 --> 20:02.866
Your caterers
really go all out.

20:04.269 --> 20:07.538
I know why that thing
with Josh was meant to be--

20:07.605 --> 20:10.073
made me appreciate
how much Harvey means to me.

20:10.141 --> 20:11.408
And I know
another reason

20:11.476 --> 20:13.643
why the whole Josh
thing was meant to be.

20:13.711 --> 20:16.313
I found out I really
like Thanksgiving.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.248
Come on, you two.

20:18.316 --> 20:21.351
Everyone please, enjoy.

20:21.419 --> 20:22.786
Witch! Witch!
Witch! Witch!

20:24.355 --> 20:26.556
Sorry. Habit.

20:26.624 --> 20:28.558
Well, okay.
Um, let's go around the table

20:28.626 --> 20:30.327
and say what we're thankful for.

20:30.394 --> 20:31.729
Okay.

20:31.796 --> 20:33.330
I'm thankful for family.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.932
I'm thankful to you guys
for doing this.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.233
(muffled mouthful):
More yams.

20:37.301 --> 20:39.536
Did your cat just say
"more yams"?

20:39.771 --> 20:40.704
(laughing)

20:46.945 --> 20:48.578
Come on, you guys, dance.
Loosen up.

20:49.814 --> 20:52.415
It's not immoral, just fun.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.851
Oh, come on.
It'll help you digest your food.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.287
Live a little.
It's a holiday.

21:05.763 --> 21:07.898
Go pilgrims! Go pilgrims!
Go pilgrims!

21:07.966 --> 21:09.366
Go pilgrims!

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
