Previously on The Royals...

00:01.750 --> 00:03.721
Helena, we need to talk.

00:05.203 --> 00:06.963
Please stay. Don't go.

00:06.998 --> 00:09.733
All you need to do is find a way
to make amends with your children

00:09.767 --> 00:12.434
before 30 years passes with them too.

00:13.828 --> 00:16.630
If you truly don't have much time left,

00:16.664 --> 00:18.832
do something meaningful with it.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.135
What do you really want to do?

00:21.169 --> 00:23.870
I want to spend it with you.

00:24.414 --> 00:27.215
This was around my neck the night
before the King was killed.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.784
- What does it mean?
- We figure this out,

00:29.818 --> 00:31.625
we figure out who's
been killing my family.

00:40.926 --> 00:42.760
Why are you here?

00:42.794 --> 00:44.595
What does that symbol
on my necklace mean?

00:44.620 --> 00:46.787
Not now! We're being watched.

00:47.152 --> 00:48.585
Your Majesty.

00:49.848 --> 00:53.097
My God, Truman, I can't
imagine it can get any worse.

00:53.122 --> 00:54.339
It's your son.

00:55.020 --> 00:58.823
There is one final thing
you can do for your Queen.

00:59.122 --> 01:02.023
I killed the King of England.

01:12.286 --> 01:14.020
- You killed Simon.
- No.

01:14.054 --> 01:17.388
But we both know... you did.

01:18.527 --> 01:20.591
Mandy, why are you leaving?

01:21.019 --> 01:22.225
Did he threaten you?

01:22.626 --> 01:25.027
Fine. You won't tell her?

01:25.155 --> 01:27.324
We came here to rob you.

01:28.103 --> 01:31.551
- Mandy, is this true?
- Just let me the hell out of here!

01:31.625 --> 01:33.893
No, it's not too late to fix this.

01:34.383 --> 01:36.177
You can come back to
the Palace with me.

01:36.201 --> 01:38.019
Just tell her that you
changed your mind.

01:38.173 --> 01:42.348
Tell her that this might have been the
original reason you came here but...

01:42.466 --> 01:44.668
once you got here and got to know her,

01:45.015 --> 01:47.016
and you... you fell in love with her...

01:47.839 --> 01:49.674
..literally nothing else matters

01:49.699 --> 01:53.567
because you will give up everything
just for a second chance with her.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.818
You are so screwed.

01:59.823 --> 02:01.924
(GABRIELLE APLIN: Light Up The Dark)

02:19.832 --> 02:23.470
There is only you. I'm
here because of you.

02:23.506 --> 02:26.641
Not diamonds or some other girl.

02:28.129 --> 02:30.063
None of that has power over me now.

Go to hell!

06:05.238 --> 06:07.206
- It's your birthday.
- Whoo!

06:08.180 --> 06:10.782
I thought you might like
to go see Charlie Jones.

06:15.315 --> 06:17.415
There. One of the champagne girls.

06:17.984 --> 06:21.486
- Holden's champagne girls.
- He crashed here last night. Print it out.

Dom '93.

06:32.969 --> 06:34.476
What? Did you want The Widow?

06:34.539 --> 06:36.908
Not the booze, Holden. The girl.
Do you know her?

06:36.943 --> 06:39.611
No. But I know the other one.

06:39.645 --> 06:41.513
Known her a few times, actually.

06:41.547 --> 06:43.148
Can you get in touch with her?

06:47.153 --> 06:49.654
Zoe, do you know this girl?

06:51.489 --> 06:52.756
Yeah, I know her.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.957
"King of Bling takes a swing."

07:37.458 --> 07:40.860
"Demonstrators protest
monarch's bad behavior."

07:42.978 --> 07:45.379
I would call it bold not bad.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.735
- There is a way to make it all better.
- No!

07:49.769 --> 07:52.473
I won't be going on telly to tell
them what I'm going through.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.741
A king does not beg for compassion.
It's not his job.

07:55.775 --> 07:59.044
- You're only human.
- No. I'm a king.

08:00.188 --> 08:04.157
Violet, I love you but
your plan is simply naive.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.293
I know what I'm doing.

08:07.327 --> 08:09.295
You have to trust me.

08:09.329 --> 08:12.899
Did you just say, "Love"?

08:13.166 --> 08:14.967
Yes. I love you.

08:15.002 --> 08:18.405
I'm 45 years old. I know
what my feelings are.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.000
This tyrant is in love with you.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.445
I only met her last night.

08:26.579 --> 08:31.350
- What's her name? - I can't remember.
All we did was share a smoke break.

08:31.377 --> 08:32.710
What did you guys talk about?

08:33.625 --> 08:35.426
Tattoos. She was well into it.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.827
Anything else? Anything specific?

08:37.861 --> 08:40.363
Only her ink. I asked her
where she got it done.

08:40.398 --> 08:41.798
Where?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.195
Er... Oh, yeah. A place down in Bow.

08:50.374 --> 08:53.142
Charlie Jones!

08:54.727 --> 08:57.696
I remember 10 years ago today
when we gave you that horse.

08:57.730 --> 09:00.299
The look on your face was pure joy.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.634
- Good old friend.
- You jumped right on.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.004
Utterly fearless. And
you galloped away.

09:05.038 --> 09:07.961
I don't think I ever
really got you back.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.048
Oh, yeah. It was me who
left you in the dust.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.819
People are always telling me what an
ungrateful, spoilt little brat you are.

09:14.853 --> 09:18.022
You have been given all the material
things in life, that's true.

09:18.056 --> 09:21.759
But, perhaps I should have
given you more of myself.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.661
So...

09:23.695 --> 09:26.531
that's today's gift,
mother-daughter time.

09:26.672 --> 09:29.173
So you got me nothing?

09:29.607 --> 09:32.709
Shut up, Princess. Come on. Let's ride.

09:32.744 --> 09:35.913
- It's not the Dark Ages.
- More's the pity!

09:35.947 --> 09:37.648
You've completely lost touch.

09:37.682 --> 09:39.716
I never had touch. Thank God!

09:39.751 --> 09:43.487
And yet, for reasons that
I cannot fully fathom,

09:43.521 --> 09:46.256
the irrational totem of
majesty that you personify

09:46.290 --> 09:48.691
actually matters to the world.

09:48.725 --> 09:51.928
The pound is down, two trade
agreements have gone up the spout

09:51.962 --> 09:54.264
and students in Oxford
are threatening to riot.

09:54.298 --> 09:57.150
Sounds like a bunch
of "you" problems...

09:57.201 --> 09:59.202
acting Prime Minister.

10:00.205 --> 10:03.207
How about this for a "you" problem.

10:06.619 --> 10:08.104
Abolishment.

10:08.723 --> 10:12.025
Your brother put a bug in
the people's ear about it.

10:12.059 --> 10:14.227
All I have to do is
call it up for a vote.

10:15.229 --> 10:17.697
Like the sound of a
constitutional crisis much?

10:17.731 --> 10:21.867
You need to do something major
to show the monarchy is back

10:21.902 --> 10:25.371
in its pretty... little... box.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.981
And you need a good shag.

10:46.498 --> 10:48.800
Simon never wanted you
to have your own horse.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.834
- It's only because of me...
- I know. I know.

10:50.868 --> 10:52.336
You argued with him on my behalf.

10:52.370 --> 10:53.971
Remember the arguments?

10:55.503 --> 10:56.371
He cared about me.

10:57.063 --> 10:58.931
He thought you needed coddling.

10:59.321 --> 11:01.022
I knew you needed freedom.

11:02.725 --> 11:04.759
Oh, you say, "Freedom"?

11:04.794 --> 11:07.361
See, I say, "Abandonment".

11:07.387 --> 11:09.489
Consider yourself lucky.

11:10.465 --> 11:12.766
I prayed for my mother to
give me some "abandonment".

11:12.801 --> 11:14.401
The Duchy rocks.

11:15.403 --> 11:17.905
She could break the
spirit of any animal...

11:17.939 --> 11:19.640
human or otherwise.

11:19.674 --> 11:21.742
You've never seen that
side of your grandmother.

11:21.776 --> 11:25.144
Believe me, her anger
could be terrifying.

11:25.672 --> 11:27.626
Whooo! Bully for her.

11:27.751 --> 11:30.251
I never resorted to
my mother's methods.

11:30.342 --> 11:32.744
I never wanted to crush your spirit.

11:33.512 --> 11:35.346
And, as a result, you fight me

11:35.380 --> 11:36.981
instead of doing my bidding.

11:38.851 --> 11:41.185
Hold on to all that
fight in you, Eleanor.

11:41.219 --> 11:43.153
It's what's going to protect you.

11:43.188 --> 11:46.623
It's going to save you from this
world you've been born into.

11:47.492 --> 11:52.630
A diamond world - sparkling
and cold and hard.

11:59.274 --> 12:03.611
I'd rather you fight your
mother than be her machine.

12:25.508 --> 12:27.943
Oh, hey there. Glad you
could make it, Ted.

12:27.977 --> 12:30.511
Thanks ever so much for coming.
I'm just making soup.

12:30.546 --> 12:32.146
You're gonna love it.

12:40.461 --> 12:41.609
♪

12:42.141 --> 12:43.340
What is all of this?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.109
Hearty leek and potato.

12:45.144 --> 12:46.047
Delicious.

12:46.072 --> 12:48.984
You have 10 seconds to tell
me exactly who you are,

12:49.070 --> 12:51.472
why you brought me here,
and what you want.

12:51.506 --> 12:53.140
All fair questions.

12:53.174 --> 12:55.276
But the thing you really want to ask me

12:55.310 --> 12:57.144
is how I knew that you killed Simon.

12:57.178 --> 12:58.346
Nine.

12:59.539 --> 13:00.781
And you can't ask directly.

13:00.815 --> 13:02.416
Too incriminating.

13:02.451 --> 13:04.417
This could be a Scotland Yard sting.

13:04.452 --> 13:05.885
Eight.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.445
If all the King's horses and all the
King's men couldn't put it together

13:08.539 --> 13:09.739
how did I know?

13:09.773 --> 13:11.108
Six.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.527
You're not going to shoot me, Mr.
Pryce.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.496
Because you don't know
who else I've told.

13:18.148 --> 13:20.916
So drop the gun and the act.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.615
What's that sound?

13:27.889 --> 13:31.037
A helicopter overhead? A battering ram?

13:31.155 --> 13:33.823
The jingle of handcuffs
as they come to get me?

13:34.327 --> 13:36.128
No, I don't hear any of that.

13:37.975 --> 13:38.963
You came here alone.

13:38.997 --> 13:42.667
And every minute an assault team
doesn't show up at my door,

13:43.249 --> 13:44.850
I'm proven right.

13:44.884 --> 13:46.685
You killed Simon.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.243
How did I figure it out, you ask?

13:50.507 --> 13:53.175
I'm a student of human nature, Ted.

13:53.676 --> 13:56.210
Once I figured out motive, I poked

13:56.245 --> 13:58.913
and I pushed a few buttons
to see what you'd do.

13:59.710 --> 14:02.389
I saw the pain in your
face at the museum.

14:02.414 --> 14:05.397
And I saw the fear in your eyes
when I said you killed the King.

14:06.139 --> 14:07.740
That's how I knew.

14:08.968 --> 14:11.836
The human body has a
vast number of "tells".

14:11.870 --> 14:14.772
- You're no exception.
- You don't know anything!

14:14.807 --> 14:18.375
Technically, I don't. No
hard evidence at least.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.267
Just a hunch and a bluff.

14:21.046 --> 14:23.614
But I don't need
irrefutable proof, Ted.

14:23.649 --> 14:25.316
Because I'm not arresting you.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.922
And I'm not trying to
poison you either.

14:35.153 --> 14:36.753
I need you.

14:38.496 --> 14:40.330
(Slurps)

14:40.974 --> 14:44.442
So either shoot me or eat
some soup and hear me out.

14:54.252 --> 14:56.721
No, no. Come on. Leave, leave.
I'll be Mother.

14:56.755 --> 14:57.655
There.

14:58.823 --> 15:02.024
I've been dying to ask.
Are the boobs real?

15:04.495 --> 15:07.297
Since when have you been
squeamish about details?

15:08.132 --> 15:11.101
I've been living vicariously
through your exploits for years.

15:11.135 --> 15:16.006
Oh, come now. You still have a few
exploits of your own now and again.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.173
- Or so I hear.
- Oh, well...

15:18.208 --> 15:19.809
A lady never tells.

15:19.843 --> 15:22.712
Oh, and... erm... speaking of exploits...

15:23.162 --> 15:24.896
..yours have upset the people.

15:24.931 --> 15:28.099
Since when is a wolf concerned
with the opinions of sheep?

15:28.901 --> 15:32.237
A wolf cannot feast on lamb
alone if the flock has bolted.

15:32.450 --> 15:34.683
You suggested a push for power.

15:34.959 --> 15:39.629
I have always had an iron
fist in a velvet glove.

15:39.663 --> 15:43.299
You took the gloves off and
that was a grave mistake.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.668
You need to subjugate your subjects.

15:45.703 --> 15:49.305
And I, luckily for you, have a plan.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.506
- You always do.
- Yes.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.909
- Get rid of the girl.
- Oh!

15:54.154 --> 15:56.636
You need the support
of the aristocracy.

15:56.670 --> 16:00.007
And they consider your silly
little floozy a joke.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.542
Do you want to be feared or a fool?

16:04.623 --> 16:06.224
Ditch the bitch.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.005
Violet. My Violet.

16:08.091 --> 16:10.552
You underestimate that delicate bloom.

16:10.588 --> 16:13.590
Unlike you, she lacks artifice,
self-interest and...

16:13.624 --> 16:16.126
- A brain?
- She has a remarkable intelligence.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.327
(Scoffs)

16:17.361 --> 16:20.697
As it happens, she suggested
an excellent plan of her own

16:20.732 --> 16:22.932
as regards to my relationship
with the people.

16:23.499 --> 16:27.069
And I shall be putting it into
action before the end of the day.

16:27.104 --> 16:30.706
Well, I can't wait to
hear what she has to say.

16:30.741 --> 16:33.075
And yet, you will have to.

16:33.110 --> 16:36.545
You're on a need-to-know
basis only from now on.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.881
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:38.915 --> 16:41.122
I've got some very real
boobs to go fondle.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.942
And a speech to write.

17:00.216 --> 17:02.284
So tell me more about the Duchy.

17:02.319 --> 17:04.653
Did she sleep with your boyfriends too?

17:06.021 --> 17:07.856
I'm sorry for what I did.

17:07.890 --> 17:11.159
And you should know, it was
me who initiated not Jasper.

17:11.194 --> 17:13.795
- I forced his hand.
- Not just his hand.

17:15.396 --> 17:18.065
I could see you were about
to throw your heart away.

17:18.098 --> 17:21.167
At marriageable age, the
stakes are just too high.

17:21.203 --> 17:23.103
So much more if you're royal.

17:24.573 --> 17:26.540
But if I'd told you not to see him

17:26.575 --> 17:28.958
or if I'd had him fired,

17:29.045 --> 17:30.978
you would have wanted him even more.

17:31.004 --> 17:33.450
You'd have gone to the
ends of the earth for him.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.895
And Jasper Frost didn't seem worthy.

17:38.765 --> 17:40.599
Certainly not trustworthy.

17:42.576 --> 17:44.177
You did it to hurt me.

17:46.179 --> 17:49.715
And to, once again, show me
that I was making a mistake.

17:49.749 --> 17:52.651
Well, perhaps I was wrong.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.078
No, you weren't.

18:01.318 --> 18:03.151
Design books are over there.

18:03.186 --> 18:05.354
Let me know if you want your own thing.

18:07.357 --> 18:08.991
I was thinking about this.

18:10.994 --> 18:12.662
That's an interesting design.

18:12.810 --> 18:15.012
Can't say I've ever seen that before.

18:21.118 --> 18:23.386
This the kind of thing
you're looking for?

18:24.615 --> 18:25.341
No.

18:25.443 --> 18:27.010
Got my heart set on this.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.112
Look this girl up. She
might be able to help you.

18:37.582 --> 18:41.318
Any more information?
Perhaps a number, address?

18:41.352 --> 18:42.919
That's all I've got.

18:42.953 --> 18:44.288
Good luck.

18:51.677 --> 18:53.510
Hm.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.298
It's an interesting dilemma, yours.

18:56.332 --> 18:59.734
If you ask the questions you
need to ask, you imply guilt.

18:59.768 --> 19:02.603
And if you don't, you get no answers.

19:03.439 --> 19:05.573
I want to know what you
think you're accomplishing

19:05.607 --> 19:08.576
by all of this and why
you've deluded yourself

19:08.610 --> 19:10.544
into thinking I can help you.

19:10.578 --> 19:12.512
Counter transference.

19:12.547 --> 19:16.183
Good ploy. Well played. Okay.

19:16.218 --> 19:18.618
Answers. Fine.

19:19.587 --> 19:21.088
Well, it's quite a story.

19:21.873 --> 19:23.874
I think you're going to like it.

19:51.466 --> 19:53.501
What a delightful surprise.

19:56.837 --> 19:58.705
Come on. Come in.

20:04.011 --> 20:07.080
Piled high with Hobnobs.
Just the way your dad liked.

20:09.497 --> 20:11.665
A king's old equerry never forgets.

20:12.755 --> 20:17.225
So... What brings the
Prince to my humble abode?

20:17.259 --> 20:19.060
You're the only person
I can truly trust

20:19.094 --> 20:21.195
who knew my father when he was young.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.961
Does this mean anything to you?

20:27.794 --> 20:31.596
Well, this is gonna be a
rather different conversation

20:31.631 --> 20:33.232
than I'd imagined.

20:34.264 --> 20:35.598
You knew her?

20:36.766 --> 20:38.366
Indeed.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.774
I looked online. There
wasn't much to go on.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.844
But, from what I can tell, it seems like
she knew my family a long time ago.

20:46.904 --> 20:48.505
Dominique Stewart.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.311
She was your father's true love.

20:56.981 --> 20:58.282
She was...

20:58.316 --> 20:59.983
..my sister.

21:00.060 --> 21:03.122
She was kind and... clever.

21:03.482 --> 21:04.649
And elegant.

21:04.683 --> 21:06.283
Everyone loved her.

21:08.320 --> 21:13.057
But no one more than Simon.
You understand.

21:13.092 --> 21:15.226
The minute he ascended the throne,

21:15.260 --> 21:17.528
the powers that be
started compiling a list

21:17.562 --> 21:19.395
of appropriate brides for him.

21:19.430 --> 21:23.033
All of them worthy, all of them
attractive and well educated.

21:23.568 --> 21:26.370
"They can have their list
but I've got my own list.

21:26.405 --> 21:28.239
And there's only one name on it."

21:29.241 --> 21:30.707
That's what he said.

21:30.742 --> 21:35.211
By the way, she was on their
list but he didn't care.

21:35.246 --> 21:38.915
What she and your father felt
for each other was much bigger.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.160
And... er... rightly so.

21:42.563 --> 21:44.950
I would venture to say
that they were...

21:44.988 --> 21:46.855
..a perfect match.

21:47.234 --> 21:48.401
Destined.

21:48.435 --> 21:52.371
Not just because she was the
right age and well mannered

21:53.817 --> 21:55.677
and beautiful, but because
of our family line.

21:56.164 --> 21:59.766
A truly noble line that dates
back to Alfred the Great.

22:00.476 --> 22:02.711
And that mattered a
great deal, of course.

22:02.745 --> 22:06.514
It didn't matter a bit to your dad
who the Stewarts were, of course.

22:07.550 --> 22:09.507
Ancient blood lines and all that.

22:09.554 --> 22:11.856
No, he was just a boy
in love with a girl.

22:12.257 --> 22:13.858
Choose love.

22:14.992 --> 22:16.360
Wait here.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.933
- When was this taken?
- Oh, it's 30-odd years ago.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.369
She was a showjumper?

22:26.403 --> 22:29.137
Oh, not Olympic level.
Nothing like that.

22:29.172 --> 22:30.773
Just local fun.

22:30.804 --> 22:34.374
Sometimes, your dad would go
along and cheer on Dominique.

22:34.409 --> 22:37.944
When I was little, I
couldn't pronounce her name.

22:39.406 --> 22:41.006
So I called her Domino.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.048
Where was my mother during this time?

22:54.212 --> 22:58.348
There was a time when I had real
undeniable love in my life.

22:59.766 --> 23:01.767
That Henry guy you
spoke about on the TV?

23:02.969 --> 23:05.271
No. That was a lie.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.182
This isn't.

23:12.229 --> 23:13.862
He worked on our farm.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.746
I would go out riding

23:15.781 --> 23:17.375
just to catch a glimpse
of him in the fields.

23:18.227 --> 23:20.446
God forbid my family
should have found out.

23:21.696 --> 23:24.030
Helena's family was
coming up in the world.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.882
One way or another, your gran
got Helena onto the list

23:26.916 --> 23:28.150
of girls for Simon.

23:28.935 --> 23:33.236
Lord knows how she did it but Helena
certainly qualified as a great beauty.

23:33.271 --> 23:35.472
The young king would dance with her

23:35.506 --> 23:38.145
at all your grandmother's parties.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.068
'Infamously extravagant parties

23:41.103 --> 23:44.372
expressly designed to match
her daughter with royalty.'

23:44.825 --> 23:46.592
We were planning to elope.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.595
The boy that I loved
couldn't afford a diamond

23:50.630 --> 23:53.532
so I picked out a pebble
from the shore near here.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.268
And we were going to have it
set into an engagement ring.

23:56.779 --> 23:58.262
A pebble?

23:59.411 --> 24:00.762
You didn't know me then.

24:00.919 --> 24:02.886
Maybe he would have bought
me a diamond one day,

24:02.921 --> 24:05.255
but honestly, Eleanor, I didn't care.

24:05.896 --> 24:07.463
I was in love.

24:07.497 --> 24:10.599
And that meant much more to me.
Much more.

24:12.019 --> 24:13.721
I thought my life was set.

24:14.998 --> 24:17.066
But the thing about love and life...

24:17.704 --> 24:19.806
..it rarely goes according to plan.

25:00.243 --> 25:01.845
(Horse whinnies)

25:20.763 --> 25:22.897
Domino? Domino!

25:22.932 --> 25:24.966
(HELENA)'Fate didn't
care what I'd planned.'

25:25.000 --> 25:25.967
Domino!

25:26.001 --> 25:29.470
'Fate didn't care that
I'd fallen in love.'

25:29.521 --> 25:31.403
She was thrown from her horse...

25:32.423 --> 25:34.758
coming back from competition that day.

25:34.793 --> 25:39.096
She died just a few hours
after that picture was taken.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.474
So tragic.

25:42.033 --> 25:44.667
As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.769
They kill us for their sport.

25:46.804 --> 25:48.305
He loved her.

25:48.339 --> 25:52.044
Nonetheless, he had a duty
to continue the line.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.489
The heir and the spare.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.651
Hm. A bachelor king would never do.

25:55.686 --> 25:59.437
No. So he hid his private
pain and... er...

25:59.469 --> 26:00.726
publicly carried on.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.609
The country was in a recession.

26:02.758 --> 26:05.694
Something was needed to
restore public morale.

26:06.243 --> 26:08.544
And what better than a royal wedding?

26:08.579 --> 26:12.381
That's the drill. The economy
sorely needed a boost.

26:12.399 --> 26:14.166
Especially after Black Friday.

26:14.659 --> 26:16.766
(HELENA) 'That day was well named.'

26:16.868 --> 26:18.969
I'd never seen my father cry before.

26:19.704 --> 26:22.405
He'd always kept everyone in
the dark about family finances

26:22.439 --> 26:25.341
but Black Friday finished us off.

26:25.845 --> 26:30.649
After that, all the family's
hopes were pinned on me.

26:30.683 --> 26:33.184
I told my mother I was in
love with someone else

26:33.462 --> 26:35.864
but that was less of an option.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.314
The most eligible bachelor
in the world was interested.

26:43.252 --> 26:44.853
(Water babbling)

26:51.790 --> 26:53.658
All of the diamonds...

26:55.094 --> 26:57.429
..I would have been
happy with a pebble.

26:58.331 --> 27:00.265
And I said yes to my mother's plan.

27:02.009 --> 27:03.609
And became Queen.

27:04.577 --> 27:06.812
Glamor and the status.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.248
Yes.

27:09.436 --> 27:11.047
After a while, it mattered.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.272
I became a different person.

27:15.647 --> 27:17.561
But the girl who wanted the freedom

27:17.835 --> 27:19.436
to choose for herself...

27:20.805 --> 27:22.905
..and a pebble set in
an engagement ring...

27:24.541 --> 27:26.141
..all she wanted was love.

27:29.613 --> 27:32.114
Well, you made the right call, Mum.

27:33.717 --> 27:35.918
To hell with love, it's a loser's game.

27:38.555 --> 27:41.322
Darling, I told you my story

27:41.356 --> 27:43.825
so that you could be happier than me.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.795
I want you to have a chance at love.

27:48.030 --> 27:49.564
That's nice, Mum, really.

27:51.534 --> 27:53.134
I don't have a chance.

27:55.671 --> 27:58.605
I've seen the way Jasper
Frost looks at you.

27:59.171 --> 28:01.973
There's only one man who
ever looked at me that way.

28:02.788 --> 28:04.856
He wasn't rich or royal.

28:04.890 --> 28:06.490
He was only the help.

28:07.226 --> 28:08.827
But he was my love.

28:09.882 --> 28:12.975
And I messed it up. Royally.

28:13.577 --> 28:15.844
- So if you have feelings...
- I don't.

28:17.814 --> 28:19.415
Okay?

28:23.069 --> 28:26.538
People just love me
for what I am, Mum...

28:26.572 --> 28:28.373
they don't love me for who I am.

28:28.952 --> 28:30.685
That's just not true!

28:31.920 --> 28:34.222
Eleanor, look at me.

28:37.414 --> 28:39.350
Are you saying no one
will ever love you

28:39.375 --> 28:40.608
for who you really are?

28:42.179 --> 28:43.814
Someone already does.

28:45.179 --> 28:46.346
I do.

28:47.843 --> 28:49.409
I always have.

28:50.193 --> 28:51.202
And I always will.

28:58.887 --> 29:00.487
(Exhales)

29:13.709 --> 29:16.592
My sister's death destroyed my family.

29:18.021 --> 29:21.658
And my sister's death
was not an accident.

29:21.692 --> 29:23.959
There was only one person standing

29:23.994 --> 29:26.995
between the current Queen
Consort and that throne.

29:27.029 --> 29:28.297
Dominique.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.499
I assume there was an investigation.

29:30.533 --> 29:34.636
We went to Scotland Yard but
the aristocracy closed ranks.

29:35.170 --> 29:37.404
The more fuss my parents
made, the worse it got.

29:37.438 --> 29:41.108
Debts were called in, our
prospects destroyed.

29:41.142 --> 29:42.875
We lost everything...

29:42.910 --> 29:44.777
including our honor.

29:45.471 --> 29:48.673
Our noble family discarded
and smashed into the dust.

29:48.707 --> 29:52.844
Our families deserve justice, Ted.
Yours and mine.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.812
And they deserve to be punished.

29:54.847 --> 29:56.681
The damage that's been done.

29:57.143 --> 30:00.277
Your wife gone. Your daughter
raised as a motherless child.

30:00.311 --> 30:01.779
Stop! Stop.

30:04.850 --> 30:07.518
Just suppose for a moment
that you're correct...

30:08.323 --> 30:09.520
and that I killed Simon.

30:09.555 --> 30:11.409
If I'm the man you think I am,

30:11.434 --> 30:15.324
I'm doing your dirty work. Why
not just let me carry on?

30:15.359 --> 30:16.760
Maybe the Queen was next.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.015
Death is too easy for her.

30:19.050 --> 30:22.752
What I have in mind is so
much more appropriate.

30:23.315 --> 30:28.452
She will live in a constant
hell of grief and regret,

30:29.331 --> 30:32.265
poverty, shame and fear.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.025
People will spit in her face

30:35.060 --> 30:36.660
when she walks down the street

30:36.695 --> 30:41.231
instead of waving and bowing
and handing her flowers.

30:42.058 --> 30:43.992
They wanted a legacy?

30:44.026 --> 30:46.094
We'll give them one,
the one they earned.

30:49.698 --> 30:52.666
Your sister died a long time ago.
Why now?

30:54.569 --> 30:56.537
Until Prince Robert was killed,

30:56.571 --> 30:58.639
also called an "accident"...

30:59.741 --> 31:02.176
..I never knew I had an
ally inside the Palace.

31:03.178 --> 31:06.947
Isn't it a relief to finally
meet someone who understands?

31:15.485 --> 31:17.352
(Helena and Eleanor giggle)

31:28.159 --> 31:29.726
I don't know what you've done

31:29.761 --> 31:32.401
that could possibly be
worse than what I know,

31:32.870 --> 31:34.932
but you need to find a way
to make it up to her.

31:35.455 --> 31:36.409
She cares.

31:36.734 --> 31:38.268
Deeply, I suspect.

31:38.780 --> 31:42.065
Rally back, bodyguard. Do
something to make it right.

31:42.707 --> 31:44.308
I'm rooting for you.

31:52.643 --> 31:54.876
- Where have you been?
- With Eleanor.

31:54.911 --> 31:57.712
Well, you've spent the
day with the wrong girl.

31:57.747 --> 32:00.049
I spent the day with my
daughter on her birthday.

32:00.083 --> 32:02.484
How's that so difficult
for you to understand?

32:02.519 --> 32:04.953
Because, unlike you, I have
my priorities straight.

32:04.987 --> 32:08.845
You see, while you were
out horsing around,

32:08.892 --> 32:11.559
I went to visit my good
friend the Crown Jeweler.

32:11.594 --> 32:15.530
And he told me that
Cyrus has picked out

32:15.564 --> 32:17.432
an engagement ring.

32:18.752 --> 32:22.320
Now, if they are still
married when he dies,

32:22.355 --> 32:26.024
she will be the sole reigning monarch,

32:26.058 --> 32:29.026
thanks to your brilliant
Bill of Succession.

32:29.267 --> 32:33.130
I'm not close to you, Helena,
because you're my daughter,

32:33.164 --> 32:35.433
I'm close to you because
you're the Queen.

32:35.775 --> 32:38.910
So I'd better go and cozy up to her.

32:44.249 --> 32:47.885
Violet, oh, how very nice
to see you, my dear.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.720
(GRAND DUCHESS) Mwah! Mwah!

33:10.607 --> 33:11.829
Where the devil have you been?

33:11.854 --> 33:14.517
- Sorry, the Grand Duchess had me for tea.
- What?

33:14.542 --> 33:16.821
She was so nice. She wanted
to know all about me.

33:16.837 --> 33:20.673
She is not your friend.
Stay away from that witch.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.943
Oh, stop. You're only ever
mean when you're nervous.

33:25.319 --> 33:28.087
I'm not nervous talking to the people.

33:28.192 --> 33:30.402
Yes, you are. We both know it.

33:30.427 --> 33:32.529
Well, you know what's not helping?

33:32.564 --> 33:33.777
The fact that you never said it back.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.404
- I love you?
- It's a question not a statement.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.984
You caught me off guard, that's all.

33:39.389 --> 33:41.323
Those words are hard for me to say.

33:41.357 --> 33:43.158
It's okay if you don't.

33:44.027 --> 33:45.595
You need to breathe.

33:45.629 --> 33:48.931
One time when I was seven,
I had to sing a solo

33:48.966 --> 33:50.932
at the school Happy Christmas Fair.

33:50.967 --> 33:54.131
- I was Rudolph.
- Of course you were.

33:54.210 --> 33:57.145
And my grandmother told
me to relax and breathe.

33:57.647 --> 34:00.287
And then she gave me something
that made it all better.

34:00.460 --> 34:03.429
I'm going to get it for you.
I want you to have it.

34:05.061 --> 34:08.663
Wait. I need you here not your things.

34:08.697 --> 34:12.858
You don't need me, honey, but
it's nice you say you do.

34:13.413 --> 34:15.848
I'll be back before the broadcast.
I promise.

34:19.678 --> 34:23.112
And the answer is yes. Of course I do.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.381
My father loved her.

35:03.132 --> 35:04.733
Come with me.

35:11.186 --> 35:13.953
She was my aunt. I was named after her.

35:13.988 --> 35:16.356
My whole life I've been
taught to hate you

35:16.390 --> 35:18.358
- and everything about you.
- Okay.

35:18.392 --> 35:20.693
That night we followed you
and put the symbol on you,

35:20.727 --> 35:23.629
you really didn't seem
like a bad person.

35:24.451 --> 35:25.817
You seemed broken.

35:25.890 --> 35:27.758
I was.

35:29.296 --> 35:31.063
Sometimes I still am.

35:31.097 --> 35:33.531
And that speech you
gave at the memorial.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.067
- I don't know what to think of you now.
- You said, "We."

35:37.102 --> 35:39.403
Who's "we"? Why are you
supposed to hate me?

35:39.438 --> 35:42.206
Please, stop with the riddles
and tell me what this is about.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.742
- Who is always watching?
- My father. Her brother.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.743
The symbol on my necklace
- tumbling dominoes.

35:46.777 --> 35:48.712
What's gonna come tumbling down?

35:49.083 --> 35:51.751
Your family. Domino was her nickname.

35:51.785 --> 35:55.255
The day she died, she was
competing in a showjumping event.

35:55.699 --> 35:56.395
Yes.

35:57.093 --> 35:59.328
She rode home to give
the horse a cool down.

35:59.684 --> 36:01.074
My father was waiting for her.

36:01.099 --> 36:03.919
When the horse returned, it
was all jumped up and hyper.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.888
- In a foaming sweat.
- It was drugged.

36:05.922 --> 36:08.558
They didn't test for that
until five days afterwards.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.352
By which point, the
drugs would have passed

36:10.394 --> 36:12.817
through the horse's system.
She was an expert rider.

36:12.950 --> 36:15.318
She and that horse
were totally in sync.

36:16.580 --> 36:19.547
Liam, your mother's
family hosted the event.

36:19.582 --> 36:22.351
They planned the whole
thing, invited Dominique.

36:22.385 --> 36:23.785
She and your mother were rivals.

36:23.819 --> 36:25.246
That's one hell of an accusation.

36:25.348 --> 36:28.160
My dad, his whole
family were destroyed.

36:28.194 --> 36:31.163
Emotionally, financially. Everything.

36:31.197 --> 36:34.033
Proving Dominique was
killed, getting justice...

36:34.067 --> 36:35.267
it's the family business.

36:35.301 --> 36:39.203
And you're part of it by
choice or just born and bound?

36:41.073 --> 36:42.473
Born and bound but...

36:42.507 --> 36:44.175
Until you can find a way to be free,

36:45.059 --> 36:47.494
you gotta do what you gotta do.

36:47.529 --> 36:50.063
- I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- One last question.

36:50.497 --> 36:52.998
Is it justice your
father wants or revenge?

36:53.532 --> 36:55.334
My father and my brother are dead.

36:55.368 --> 36:58.303
We had nothing to do with that.
Nothing.

37:14.669 --> 37:17.153
Your Majesty, we just need
to do a quick sound test

37:17.186 --> 37:19.320
then we'll be live to
all major networks.

37:19.355 --> 37:22.691
I won't start till the Lady
of the Privy Chamber is here.

37:22.725 --> 37:24.325
She said she'd be back by now.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.729
She's the frigging maid.

37:36.708 --> 37:38.075
You're late.

37:38.942 --> 37:41.010
I was doing what you told me to do.

37:42.075 --> 37:43.309
And?

37:44.010 --> 37:45.944
He knows what he needs to know now.

37:47.547 --> 37:49.147
He's charismatic, isn't he?

37:52.426 --> 37:53.207
The Prince.

37:54.101 --> 37:54.731
He's okay.

38:13.405 --> 38:15.039
(Laughs)

38:20.520 --> 38:22.199
We are live in...

38:22.549 --> 38:26.567
five, four, three...

39:14.798 --> 39:16.399
