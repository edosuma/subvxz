WEBVTT

00:13.926 --> 00:16.407
What a way to start the day.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.810
What do we got? On patrol,
everything's quiet.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.266
All of a sudden we see her
climbing out that window.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.509
Didn't even have time
to tell her to get back.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.076
She jumps and
hangs herself.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.078
I still can't
believe it. Anyone else around?

00:35.122 --> 00:36.297
Homeless guy,
but he booked.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.559
I did see a
cleaning crew

00:37.602 --> 00:39.145
working in that building
across the street.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.278
Let's go find out
what they saw. I'll catch up with you.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.521
You in charge here? Yes.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.393
Clive Houk.
Executive manager.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.003
Houk? Houk, uh, Hotel Group?

00:47.047 --> 00:50.050
The guys gobbling up all
the properties around the city?

00:50.093 --> 00:51.418
We acquired this
property last year.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.966
I came from Eindhoven to
personally oversee it.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.621
And you end up with a guest taking a leap,
huh? Oh, no.

00:56.665 --> 00:57.883
She's not a guest.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.494
She's one of our
housekeepers.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.756
Daria Yuval.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.280
Even in the eight months
that I've been here,

01:03.324 --> 01:04.673
we're like a family.

01:04.715 --> 01:06.979
Did she ever say anything
to you about being unhappy

01:07.023 --> 01:08.633
about anything? Nothing.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.722
And I'll do whatever
I can to help.

01:10.766 --> 01:11.897
We all will.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.682
First things first,
let's get her down.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.989
We don't want the city
waking up, seeing her like that.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.304
What are we doing here
and not in our office?

01:27.348 --> 01:28.566
This is my other office.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.133
No, this is a coffee shop.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.744
My other office where I
conduct unofficial business.

01:32.788 --> 01:33.963
Sit down.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.574
What unofficial business
could we have?

01:36.618 --> 01:37.662
Him.

01:37.706 --> 01:38.968
Him who?

01:39.011 --> 01:40.317
Mario Vangelis.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.537
Your brother collared him
a couple years back

01:42.580 --> 01:45.322
on racketeering
and attempted murder charges.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.802
That's official
business, no?

01:46.845 --> 01:48.151
An investigator
pal of mine

01:48.195 --> 01:51.023
working on his defense
gave me a whistle.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.287
Vangelis's trial is
finally coming up,

01:53.330 --> 01:55.811
and suddenly he has
information he wants to trade.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.987
So? I'm not
the prosecutor on it.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.468
Solid information,
with forensic evidence,

02:00.511 --> 02:03.819
about corruption in ouroffice.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.734
A gangster trying
to smear the office

02:05.777 --> 02:07.562
that's trying to convict him?

02:07.605 --> 02:09.781
It could be just that,
or it couldn't.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.609
Still, if I consider
the source...

02:11.653 --> 02:13.611
Also consider that
when a guy like Vangelis

02:13.655 --> 02:15.831
says he knows
where the bodies are buried,

02:15.874 --> 02:18.442
there's usually a body, buried.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.187
Good morning, Reagan.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.189
Good morning. Good RDOs?

02:26.233 --> 02:27.756
Yeah, very relaxing,
thank you.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.453
I guess you didn't see it.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.628
See what?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.195
Hey, boss,
come look at this.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.066
This is last night,
check-cashing joint

02:34.110 --> 02:35.285
in Hamilton Heights.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.287
Guard comes
for the day's haul.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.942
Bad guy pops him
without so much as a word.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.379
Yikes. Yeah, it gets worse.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.555
Guard's hanging on by a thread
but still manages

02:44.599 --> 02:47.558
to put two in the guy;
Didn't slow him down a step.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.386
He's got to be wearing
a vest, right?

02:49.430 --> 02:52.172
Yeah. Let that be a reminder to
you guys: Perps are better armed

02:52.215 --> 02:54.609
and better protected than ever
out there, so...

02:54.652 --> 02:56.369
watch your back
and watch your partner's back.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.917
Yes, sir. Wise words, folks.

02:59.918 --> 03:02.225
Why's IAB in the house? We took over

03:02.269 --> 03:04.662
the investigation from
the precinct detective squad.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.970
Perp's vest was found ditched
a couple blocks away.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.276
And? And the serial number

03:09.319 --> 03:12.279
on it says it belongs
to you, Sergeant Reagan.

03:16.239 --> 03:19.416
Your noon tabletop with
Homeland Security got pushed.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.244
Director apparently has the flu.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.637
My sympathies to him.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.726
But your 11:00 a.m.
with Mayor Poole is still on.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.554
What else?

03:26.597 --> 03:28.557
The rest of the day is
per the published schedule.

03:28.599 --> 03:29.948
Except for what?

03:32.560 --> 03:33.735
Sir?

03:33.778 --> 03:35.650
Poole was two mayors ago.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.349
Did I say Poole, not Chase?

03:39.393 --> 03:41.960
Because the "what else"
will either upset me,

03:42.004 --> 03:45.486
or you're not sure
it rises to my level.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.052
The latter.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.054
Okay. Out with it.

03:49.098 --> 03:53.320
Last night, Brian was
at a charity event in Mapleton.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.322
Guy from the 8-0
comes up to him,

03:55.365 --> 03:57.324
says a civilian
reached out to him

03:57.367 --> 04:00.544
needing to get a message
to his "old pal" Frank Reagan.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.112
So third-hand,
with all the sketchy trimmings.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.113
Hence my hesitation.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.288
Civilian have a name?

04:05.332 --> 04:06.768
He didn't think
you'd remember him.

04:06.811 --> 04:10.424
But he said to say,
"If you sweep, you see."

04:12.339 --> 04:14.993
That ring a bell?

04:15.037 --> 04:16.908
Yeah.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.956
My first exposure
to the art of spin.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.481
But sweeping was
the least of it.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.310
Most of it was on my hands
and knees scraping up Dots

04:27.354 --> 04:31.314
and Jujubes and Turkish Taffy
and God knows what else.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.274
Hmm.

04:34.317 --> 04:38.321
Well, he also said to say that
he would have come here himself,

04:38.365 --> 04:40.192
but he can't.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.678
Reschedule the mayor.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.664
Daria Yuval, 38 years old.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.797
Yep.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.975
Why'd you do this to
yourself, Ms. Yuval?

05:25.455 --> 05:26.630
Hey, Reagan.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.937
You're not gonna believe th...

05:28.980 --> 05:30.199
You first.

05:30.242 --> 05:31.679
There's no suicide note,

05:31.722 --> 05:34.290
and the bruising on her neck
looks more consistent

05:34.334 --> 05:37.380
with hands choking her than
being caused by this bedsheet.

05:37.424 --> 05:41.689
Which explains what the cleaning
crew in the next building saw:

05:41.732 --> 05:43.734
Someone in the dark
behind our vic

05:43.778 --> 05:45.606
shoving her
out the window.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.173
You and you, out.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.523
Lock it down.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.047
Okay, so just, um,
comp their breakfasts and, um,

05:52.090 --> 05:55.398
tell them that we will have them
back into their rooms ASAP.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.573
Good. Yeah.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.184
Ah. Some of the, uh,

05:59.228 --> 06:02.187
guests are quite upset that
we have closed off this floor.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.320
Mm-hmm. So, are you done yet?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.801
No, not even close.
Daria didn't kill herself.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.019
Someone did it for her.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.021
Oh, my God.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.719
So we'll need security tapes,

06:11.762 --> 06:14.243
key card logs and interviews
with everyone in the hotel,

06:14.286 --> 06:15.462
top to bottom.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.681
Oh, but, uh... but is
that really necessary?

06:17.725 --> 06:21.032
Mr. "I'll Help Any Way I Can"
sure left the building fast.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.992
We are already
under severe financial pressure.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.950
A murder could
ruin this place.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.430
Would an unsolved murder
be better?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.910
But isn't there a better way?

06:28.953 --> 06:31.129
No, there's ourway...
We're gonna do our jobs,

06:31.173 --> 06:33.871
you're not gonna give us any
flack, and that's that, okay?

06:33.915 --> 06:35.414
Toby! DANNY: I thought I told you

06:35.438 --> 06:36.787
to lock off this floor!

06:36.831 --> 06:38.093
Yes. Uh, Miss-Miss Copley,

06:38.136 --> 06:39.224
what are you doing?

06:39.268 --> 06:40.443
I heard about Daria.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.836
It's so terrible what happened.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.620
Get her out of here. Sorry, Detective.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.056
Wait. But maybe
I could help.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.101
Lock off the floor.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.711
I'm so, so sorry.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.974
Elle has been living
here for months,

06:50.018 --> 06:52.499
so she, uh, she knows
all the employees.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.458
Someone must have given
her the override code.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.547
Hmm. Oh, well,
maybe we'll start by discussing

06:57.591 --> 07:00.202
your incredibly tight security,
then, huh?

07:11.343 --> 07:13.694
It was here on Friday
when I left.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.739
You always leave this
unlocked?

07:15.783 --> 07:17.088
It was locked.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
Someone must have cut it off.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.265
And your service weapon
on Friday?

07:20.309 --> 07:22.243
It's right here.
I took it home to clean. Sergeant,

07:22.267 --> 07:24.356
where were you last night
at 2220 hours?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.880
I was driving home
from the Catskills.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.230
Alone? No. With my wife.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.493
We stayed in a cabin there
over the weekend.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.297
Anyone not related to you
able to vouch for that?

07:32.321 --> 07:34.671
The woman at the front desk
who checked us out.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.717
The kid who sold us gas
in Ellenville

07:36.760 --> 07:38.153
on the way home.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.850
You're acting
like I'm a suspect.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.785
Got to be thorough. Well, maybe you
should focus less on me

07:41.809 --> 07:44.048
and more on the guy who put
this guard on death's doorstep.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.334
No need to be testy.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.857
He was wearing my vest
when he did it.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.077
Maybe I got the right.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.123
Look, where do we start here? "We"?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.734
Yeah. I can help. I should help.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.581
No, you should be worried
that someone ripped you off

07:55.605 --> 07:57.389
in a house
you supposedly help run.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.827
Now, if you
don't mind,

07:59.870 --> 08:02.003
this locker room is
a crime scene.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.754
Mr. K.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.625
Oh, man!

08:15.669 --> 08:17.497
Come on in!

08:17.540 --> 08:19.194
My God.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.848
Look at you.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.982
Last time I saw you,
you were at least

08:25.026 --> 08:26.636
a foot shorter than me.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.856
Well, hey, I was
15 years old.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.641
Didn't take me long
to shoot past you, shorty.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.469
Oh, always
with the mouth.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.080
Look who's talking.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.604
Lot of memories.

08:37.647 --> 08:38.692
Yeah.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.345
Can I sit in your chair?

08:40.389 --> 08:41.825
Be my guest.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.834
So, how you doing, Mr. K?

08:50.878 --> 08:53.010
Doing all right.
Can't complain.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.273
Sorry we lost touch.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.190
Well, goes both ways.

08:59.234 --> 09:00.583
Yeah.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.759
You know, I did some homework.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.587
Yeah?

09:04.631 --> 09:07.416
This about Ryan Heide?

09:08.417 --> 09:11.202
Oh, God...

09:11.246 --> 09:15.380
You... you always know how
to get to the plot, don't you?

09:15.424 --> 09:17.687
I learned from the master.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.384
Yeah.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.691
That police report
was not easy reading.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.564
I guess the guy busted in,

09:24.607 --> 09:27.044
terrorized you
for a couple hours,

09:27.088 --> 09:30.482
stole your mom's jewelry,
all the cash you had, and...

09:30.526 --> 09:32.615
worked you over pretty good.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.052
You know what really hurt is,

09:35.096 --> 09:39.883
he took my whole
movie memorabilia collection.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.581
Like I said, I read the report.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.105
A single page
of the script

09:44.148 --> 09:47.935
of The Great Escape...

09:47.978 --> 09:50.677
signed by Steve McQueen,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.636
that went for $6,000!

09:53.680 --> 09:54.768
Wow.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.118
Okay, I got one for you.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.425
Another movie
with McQueen and James Coburn.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.427
The Magnificent Seven.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.734
Name-name another.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.084
Another? Yeah.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.695
Well, I can do that.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.044
Ha-ha-ha, yeah.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.439
I can't do that.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.007
Well, Hell Is for Heroes.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.922
You're still the champ.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.445
Yeah.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.446
So...

10:21.490 --> 10:23.884
look, Mr. K.Yeah?

10:23.927 --> 10:27.235
I assume you know
that the guy who did this

10:27.278 --> 10:29.367
was caught and charged.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.630
Yeah.

10:30.673 --> 10:33.110
I-I... I-I just
don't get it.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.112
I just don't get it.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.288
You know, how...

10:37.332 --> 10:39.334
how can...

10:42.511 --> 10:47.124
Now he's coming back.
Now he's coming back.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.953
And he's, uh...

10:49.997 --> 10:51.955
Uh...

10:54.262 --> 10:57.961
Yeah, well, it's the law now.

10:58.005 --> 11:01.008
It's a crime in itself,
if you ask me.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.707
W-What kind of city
are you running

11:04.751 --> 11:09.494
where an assailant returns
to the scene of the crime...

11:09.538 --> 11:14.151
Mr. K, it's-it's supposed
to give the accused

11:14.195 --> 11:16.676
a chance to build their defense.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.028
Can you cut me a break?

11:21.071 --> 11:23.421
This is my last safe place.

11:23.465 --> 11:26.860
Look, just leave
before he gets here

11:26.903 --> 11:28.402
and don't come back
till he's gone. Uh, no...

11:28.426 --> 11:29.732
No, I can't.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.342
Well, sure, you can. No, I-I...

11:31.386 --> 11:33.693
Oh, come on.
Now that I'm a big-time PC,

11:33.736 --> 11:35.303
I'll even send a detail.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.349
I-I can't do it.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.829
No, I can't.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.657
I've got agoraphobia.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.356
Yeah, I-I can't
leave this place.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.447
If I go outside, I can't
breathe, I pee on myself,

11:49.491 --> 11:52.712
I-I make a general nuisance
of myself.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.061
I can't do it.

11:56.846 --> 11:59.370
I know what it is, Mr. K.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.731
Let me do the talking.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.602
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.737
Mr. Vangelis,
I'm Anthony Abetemarco

12:17.780 --> 12:19.042
from the D.A.'s office.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.740
You're light.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.959
4:30 on the nose.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.788
No, not late. Light.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.747
Unless she's parking the car?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.357
No, it's just me.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.795
Though you certainly heavied up,
uh, from your last attorney.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.363
Mr. Quinn. How can we help you?

12:35.406 --> 12:36.930
I ain't the one
with a trial coming up

12:36.973 --> 12:38.192
looking for a trade.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.473
We were expecting A.D.A. Reagan.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.196
Yeah. Well, you got me.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.589
Martini? No thanks, I'm on duty.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.417
My client has valuable
information

12:46.461 --> 12:47.636
for A.D.A. Reagan.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.333
Well, I'm kind of
her quality control guy.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.944
I decide what's valuable.

12:50.987 --> 12:54.208
Which is why we directed the
initial tip-off to go to you.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.211
And here I am.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.884
My client wants
to talk to A.D.A. Reagan...

12:58.908 --> 13:02.651
Yeah, I got that. And for
the last time, she sent me.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.568
Now, now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

13:06.611 --> 13:07.787
Hold up, hold up.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.790
Three, two, one.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.314
Look, I-I'm afraid
that what I got

13:13.357 --> 13:14.837
is gonna fall into
the wrong hands.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
Or be used for
the wrong ends.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.338
You're about to become
a convicted felon.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.842
Your conscience
means nothing to me.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.366
Erin Reagan is a bureau chief.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.933
All deals go through her.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.195
Yeah, so? Plus she's a Reagan.

13:25.239 --> 13:29.286
They're like the Corleones,
uh, minus Fredo.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.027
I don't follow.

13:31.071 --> 13:35.684
They're on the other side, but
you can always trust their word.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.686
Now, look,
I've thought a lot about this.

13:37.729 --> 13:38.992
I can only talk to her.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.733
For the last time...

13:42.778 --> 13:44.475
Give it to him.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.087
Give it to him.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.526
A little something
to wet your beaks.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.840
Like I said,
Daria seemed happy to me.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.754
She was a lovely woman.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.539
Any of her own
family ever drop by?

14:04.582 --> 14:05.975
Not that I saw.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.151
Now, I-I heard
that she's married,

14:08.195 --> 14:11.546
but, uh, her husband
is in Israel.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.375
Uh, his mom is ill, I think.

14:14.418 --> 14:18.901
You think. So she never actually
confided in you, right?

14:18.945 --> 14:22.687
I mean, we said hi
when she came in to do my room.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.013
I'm here on business,
from Duluth.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.865
Mm-hmm.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.214
And her demeanor?

14:28.215 --> 14:30.521
Daria was very nice.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.523
That's it?

14:32.567 --> 14:34.569
Front desk keeps me really busy.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.268
Do you know
if she had any employees

14:38.312 --> 14:39.791
she thought of as friends?

14:39.835 --> 14:41.315
I never saw Daria with anyone.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.012
And she ate alone
in the lunchroom.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.362
Well, for someone who
worked there for five years,

14:45.406 --> 14:48.539
no one seems to know very much
about this woman, good or bad.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.932
I've been there for 20.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.326
You clock in,
say "hi," get to work.Mm-hmm.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.981
So then,
you really wouldn't know

14:55.024 --> 14:57.548
if she had any enemies,
either, would you?

14:58.549 --> 14:59.942
Honestly, I never even met her.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.335
In a hotel,

15:01.378 --> 15:03.052
downstairs and upstairs
are two different worlds.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.469
And just so we're clear...
Your boss never told you

15:05.513 --> 15:07.732
what to say
or not say to me, right?

15:07.776 --> 15:10.561
The only thing Mr. Houk says
is to pour drinks heavy enough

15:10.605 --> 15:12.302
to keep guests happy
and light enough

15:12.346 --> 15:14.043
to keep our profit margin.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.699
Is it just me,

15:17.742 --> 15:19.788
or have you been hitting
a brick wall with

15:19.831 --> 15:21.224
everyone you've talked to?

15:21.268 --> 15:23.574
And bouncing off
every single one of 'em.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.403
But I know someone
who could give us more.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.929
Wait.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.756
They said they didn't know her?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.889
Mm-hmm. They all knew her.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.760
And she used
to tell me all about them.

15:35.804 --> 15:36.936
Like what?

15:36.979 --> 15:39.416
Well, that guest from Duluth...

15:39.460 --> 15:41.070
He was accidentally naked

15:41.114 --> 15:43.072
when Daria went
to turn down his room.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.770
So she filed a report
with Security.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.948
And Gabrielle at the front desk
hates Sam, the doorman,

15:48.991 --> 15:50.645
but Daria wouldn't help her

15:50.688 --> 15:53.145
get him fired because Sam bought
her a Christmas tree last year.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.562
And the concierge, Paul...

15:54.605 --> 15:56.956
He lets escorts hang out
in the bar after 10:00.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.566
And Matthew, the bartender...

15:58.609 --> 16:00.611
He deals drugs
to, like, everyone.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.004
Including Daria?

16:02.048 --> 16:04.006
Mr. Houk has everyone working
around the clock,

16:04.050 --> 16:05.747
so people need stuff
to stay awake.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.053
This Mr. Houk...

16:07.096 --> 16:09.185
He's wound pretty tight, huh?

16:09.229 --> 16:12.188
Yeah, he's a dick,
and he hates Toby.

16:12.232 --> 16:16.062
Elle, why have you and Toby been
at the Beaumaire for so long?

16:16.105 --> 16:17.977
My apartment in SoHo
is being renovated.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.849
My mom lives in San Diego,
so she put me up at the hotel.

16:20.892 --> 16:24.418
You're 16, and living
alone among strangers?

16:24.461 --> 16:26.855
I'm not alone.
They're family.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.424
Oh, and the other day,

16:30.467 --> 16:33.383
Mr. Houk and Daria were arguing
about something outside.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.951
Arguing about what?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.823
Well, it was loud,
so I couldn't really hear.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.782
Except when he yelled
something about

16:40.825 --> 16:42.827
"a damn condom."

17:01.107 --> 17:04.284
So you're telling me
there's not a single legal eagle

17:04.327 --> 17:07.678
in this entire state
who's willing to stop a perp

17:07.722 --> 17:11.073
from intimidating a victim
in the victim's own home?

17:11.117 --> 17:12.727
Not at the AG's office,

17:12.770 --> 17:15.295
not at the State Supreme,
not at the Bar Association.

17:15.338 --> 17:19.299
Then they're blind and not
in the "justice is blind" sense.

17:19.342 --> 17:22.476
Why are you leaving
out the obvious choice?

17:22.519 --> 17:24.173
The one person
who could literally

17:24.217 --> 17:26.306
walk this down the
hall and get a result?

17:26.348 --> 17:29.091
We don't do that.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.180
Anymore.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.835
Who is he to you?

17:33.878 --> 17:36.838
A piece of my past.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.101
There's been lots of them
come through here.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.972
This one seems different.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.671
He owned a movie house a few
blocks from where we grew up,

17:43.714 --> 17:46.804
and he caught me
sneaking in one day.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.938
I guess he took pity,
and he put me to work

17:49.981 --> 17:51.983
in exchange
for free movies and popcorn.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.986
That's it?

17:56.031 --> 17:58.425
No.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.688
I was, uh...

18:00.731 --> 18:03.604
pretty much a delinquent
when I was 13.

18:03.647 --> 18:07.129
Sneaking into movies
or walking out on a check

18:07.173 --> 18:10.828
in a coffee shop was pretty much
par for the course.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.092
You? Really?

18:13.135 --> 18:16.051
Yeah, me, really.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.010
Mr. K...

18:19.054 --> 18:23.798
made me feel that he saw
something better in me.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.843
And believe me,

18:25.887 --> 18:28.455
he was the kind of guy
who'd get your attention.

18:28.498 --> 18:31.545
So...

18:31.588 --> 18:33.634
I go there,

18:33.677 --> 18:35.766
and he answers the door.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.426
And Mr. K's in a wheelchair.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.083
And the only guy I knew

18:48.127 --> 18:50.651
who was as tough as my old man

18:50.694 --> 18:53.262
has slipped a couple of notches.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.266
And he's scared.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.056
Oh.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.321
So, we're on the other end now,

19:08.364 --> 19:10.888
and he's the one who's lost,

19:10.932 --> 19:13.239
and I owe him the same respect.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.363
And you didn't see anyone
coming out of the supervisors'

19:31.387 --> 19:33.104
locker room that could have been
wearing a vest?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.434
I already said I didn't.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.305
And you weren't
on your phone?

19:36.349 --> 19:37.872
Hey, what does that mean?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.893
I know you got a rip last year
for texting too much on duty.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.049
I'm not judging...

19:41.092 --> 19:42.572
Just accusing me
and everyone else.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.748
Hey, a guy got shot
because of this, Harrington.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.273
And I don't know anything more
than what I saw on that video.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.710
Look, boss, I got
to get back to work.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.190
All right.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.889
Hey, Billy,

19:54.932 --> 19:56.282
hold up.
Just wanted to ask you...

19:56.325 --> 19:57.587
I don't know anything.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.763
You didn't even let me
get to the question.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.417
Boss, I feel your pain.

20:01.461 --> 20:04.551
When someone does something bad
and you get blamed, it sucks.

20:04.594 --> 20:07.249
This isn't about me. It's
about whoever stole my vest.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.208
Either way, you're barking up
the wrong tree.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.731
I'm sorry.

20:10.774 --> 20:12.820
Doing IAB's job now, Reagan?

20:12.863 --> 20:14.928
'Cause it ain't a good look.
Fox and I were just talking.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.650
Really? 'Cause
there she goes.

20:16.693 --> 20:19.435
Just like everybody else you've
been putting the screws to.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.437
Yeah, what about you,
Wolinski? What about me?

20:21.481 --> 20:23.439
You were manning the front desk
over the weekend.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.659
Maybe you, uh,
let a civilian slip past you?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.008
Maybe you ought
to shut your yap.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.010
The Rat Squad's here
kicking over rocks

20:29.053 --> 20:30.596
because you didn't police
your equipment well enough.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.076
Yeah, and suddenly you're the
one that's bent out of shape.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.643
Maybe there's something that
you don't want 'em to find?

20:33.667 --> 20:35.146
You son of a bitch!

20:35.190 --> 20:36.278
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy!

20:38.062 --> 20:40.935
Hey, guys.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.502
Well, isn't this interesting?

20:42.545 --> 20:44.286
Any way we can
help, fellas?

20:44.330 --> 20:46.201
Nah, we were just talking
about the Mets.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.637
Yeah, it's all good.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.528
Not for you and this little
investigation of yours.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.120
We hear you asked for the
precinct's surveillance tapes

20:52.163 --> 20:53.861
and command log?

20:53.904 --> 20:55.428
Luckily, we already took 'em.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.623
Good. Then you're here to
announce that you found the guy?

20:57.647 --> 20:58.692
That's confidential.

20:58.735 --> 20:59.867
In other words, "no."

20:59.910 --> 21:02.043
Sergeant, you need
to worry about yourself.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.455
'Cause you're about
to add "obstructing"

21:03.479 --> 21:06.047
an investigation"
to your list of screwups.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.540
Hey. Anything
on the security tapes?

21:20.583 --> 21:21.715
Nothing on them.

21:21.758 --> 21:22.846
Nothing on the
card-swipes.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.195
She went in the
room alone.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.675
Nobody went in
before or after.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.677
It wasn't a ghost
that killed her.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.679
The cleaning crew saw
someone behind her.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.551
I don't know. Maybe
"damn condom" means

21:31.594 --> 21:34.554
she was having an affair with that
creepy hotel manager or somebody.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.425
So you believe Elle? Yeah. Don't you?

21:36.469 --> 21:39.167
I've been looking into
some of the leads she gave us.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.256
That hotel guest
that flashed Daria...

21:41.300 --> 21:43.911
Mm-hmm. She never even filed
a report with Security.

21:43.954 --> 21:47.697
Mm-hmm. The, uh, "escorts" that were
turning tricks in the bar...

21:47.741 --> 21:49.786
Yeah. A bunch of
models drinking martinis,

21:49.830 --> 21:52.180
bitching about
their agents. Okay, but she was right

21:52.223 --> 21:54.008
about the bartender
selling drugs.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.619
She was also right
about the front desk girl

21:56.663 --> 21:58.360
not liking the doorman.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.686
And you're
sure no one knows you're here?

22:00.710 --> 22:01.929
Of course I'm sure.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.602
Then I have
some good news for you.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.280
Enough windup. Just get to it.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.196
Sounds like two bots
running out of batteries.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.980
Vangelis is smart...
He doctored the audio

22:10.024 --> 22:11.895
so we couldn't
I.D. the voices.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.114
Hudson Yards.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.483
That's what
it's gonna be called?

22:14.507 --> 22:15.875
Yes,
and everything bordering it's

22:15.899 --> 22:17.466
gonna be called that, too.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.077
So the land
becomes Hudson Yards?

22:20.121 --> 22:21.403
It's the next hot neighborhood.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.752
Prices will soar like
there's oil under it.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.604
And you
can get it transferred to me.

22:24.647 --> 22:25.692
At the price.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.433
And you take care of...

22:27.476 --> 22:29.565
the things the D.A.'s office
would be flagging.

22:29.609 --> 22:32.220
And zoning
and permits and the unions,

22:32.263 --> 22:34.329
all included in the price. All right,
what else do I need to know?

22:34.353 --> 22:37.051
You know everything
you need to know.

22:39.227 --> 22:41.403
So somebody gave somebody

22:41.447 --> 22:43.536
something on a silver platter.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.885
Sounds like it.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.496
Are we hooked?
Is this reeling us in?

22:47.540 --> 22:49.150
That's above my pay grade.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.587
When does he name names?

22:51.631 --> 22:53.415
When he sits down with you,
I imagine.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.722
Hey, what do you think?

22:55.765 --> 22:58.246
Well... this isn't
something yet,

22:58.289 --> 23:00.857
but it's not
nothing, either.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.598
No, no, no, you have to go.

23:03.947 --> 23:04.947
What?

23:06.210 --> 23:08.952
I'm just trying to think
of who in this office

23:08.996 --> 23:11.172
I'm rooting for it to be.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.406
There's nothing you can do?

23:27.449 --> 23:28.624
The law's the law.

23:28.668 --> 23:29.930
That animal

23:29.973 --> 23:31.584
waltzes back in here,

23:31.627 --> 23:34.282
and you're acting like you
can't do anything about it.

23:34.325 --> 23:37.067
I did not say nothing. Then what?

23:37.111 --> 23:39.200
A dry run.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.028
A dry run of what?

23:41.071 --> 23:43.683
To get you out of this place!

23:43.726 --> 23:45.946
I can't.Aw, come on.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.208
No. Are you listening to me?

23:47.251 --> 23:48.209
Yeah.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.863
The Great Escape.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.212
What about it?

23:51.255 --> 23:53.214
James Garner,
Donald Pleasence. Yeah, yeah.

23:53.257 --> 23:56.043
Hendley "The Scrounger,"
and Blythe "The Forger."

23:56.086 --> 23:58.088
Yeah, yeah. That's us.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.263
How?

23:59.307 --> 24:01.396
Well, see, Pleasence
was blind,

24:01.440 --> 24:04.573
Yeah. But Garner made
sure he got him out of there.

24:04.617 --> 24:07.707
He had his back, just
like I'll have yours.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.752
Pleasence got shot
by the Germans,

24:09.796 --> 24:12.146
and Garner was recaptured.

24:12.189 --> 24:15.149
Mr. K, we are not
doing that part.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.803
We're doing the part

24:16.846 --> 24:21.329
where they safely get through
the tunnel, together.

24:21.372 --> 24:23.766
How come you got to be Garner,

24:23.810 --> 24:26.508
and I'm dead-as-a-doornail
Pleasence?

24:26.552 --> 24:29.424
Because you're the one
who's afraid to go outside.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.731
Watch your tone, kid.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.297
Watch it.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.824
Makes sense to me, I guess.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.479
See, all you have to do

24:40.522 --> 24:43.351
is make it through that door.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.269
I can't.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.662
Sure you can!

24:49.705 --> 24:51.881
Pleasence was blind,

24:51.925 --> 24:54.405
and he almost made it
to Switzerland.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.233
Come on.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.673
And...

25:00.716 --> 25:03.327
you'll be there on that day?

25:03.371 --> 25:06.809
Yeah. Maybe we'll
take in a movie.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.508
They don't make movies anymore
for you and me.

25:09.551 --> 25:13.642
Then we'll go to my house
and turn on Turner Classics.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.339
Well...

25:15.383 --> 25:16.689
Okay.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.343
Come on.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.696
Come on, Mr. K.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.747
There you go.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.491
I can't.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.580
Sure you can.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.669
I can't do it.
I-I-I...

25:40.713 --> 25:41.888
I can't do it.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.542
Just... just...

25:43.585 --> 25:45.674
go away and...

25:45.718 --> 25:47.720
leave me alone and...

25:47.763 --> 25:49.939
and forget I ever asked you.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.904
Okay.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.080
Okay.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.490
Chuck who
owned the Majestic?

26:19.534 --> 26:21.710
All these years later.

26:21.754 --> 26:22.842
Huh.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.017
What's the Majestic?

26:24.060 --> 26:25.975
It was an old movie palace
over on 4th Ave.

26:26.019 --> 26:27.649
It's been there as long
as I can remember.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.239
Until it wasn't.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.894
Drugstore chain now.
Way of the world.Mm-hmm.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.940
I always hated Chuck Kennedy.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.072
Now...

26:37.030 --> 26:38.466
Why?

26:38.509 --> 26:40.033
Because...

26:40.076 --> 26:43.427
every time I asked Francis
if he wanted to catch a flick,

26:43.471 --> 26:45.995
he'd say, "Chuck and I
have already seen it."

26:46.039 --> 26:47.431
Not every flick, Pop.

26:47.475 --> 26:48.911
The Lost World.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.131
The Longest Day.
Mutiny on the Bounty.

26:51.174 --> 26:54.656
I had to beg you to wait
to see Psychotogether.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.876
Well...

26:56.919 --> 26:58.138
You mean...?

26:58.181 --> 26:59.400
Sorry.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.054
No wonder you
weren't scared.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.971
So back in the
olden days,

27:05.014 --> 27:06.450
if you wanted to catch
a new movie,

27:06.494 --> 27:08.235
you had to schlep
all the way to a theater?

27:08.278 --> 27:10.716
And looked forward to it
all week, son.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.109
And if it was a good one,
it'd stay with you for months.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.348
And if it was a great one,
it would stay with you forever.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.722
Did all you guys
know Chuck?

27:16.765 --> 27:18.308
Sure did. JAMIE:
He was still taking tickets

27:18.332 --> 27:19.788
when we were kids. Yeah, and he used to

27:19.812 --> 27:21.485
put extra butter on our popcorn
and upsize our drinks

27:21.509 --> 27:23.032
on account of him and dad.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.817
First real perk
of being his kid.

27:24.860 --> 27:25.905
Yeah.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.254
The only perk, if you ask me.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.472
Oh, convenient memory.

27:28.516 --> 27:29.778
I'm joking.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.389
But a lot more
than just the guy taking tickets

27:32.433 --> 27:35.175
or pulling sodas... to me.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.567
Your first boss.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.700
And next to you, Pop,
probably the biggest influence

27:38.744 --> 27:40.702
on me becoming a cop.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.662
Mr. K was closing up one night...

27:43.705 --> 27:45.011
You listening to me, Sean?

27:45.054 --> 27:46.534
Okay.

27:46.577 --> 27:47.883
He said to me, "Kid",

27:47.927 --> 27:51.234
"hardly anybody
gets to be in the movies,

27:51.278 --> 27:53.672
"but you can be
a part of adventures

27:53.715 --> 27:55.848
they make movies about."

27:57.850 --> 27:59.329
Wait, what about...

27:59.373 --> 28:00.809
to serve the public good

28:00.853 --> 28:03.203
and all that other stuff
you brought us up on?

28:03.246 --> 28:05.031
I was a kid... I wasn't
that high-minded.

28:06.423 --> 28:10.732
But the idea of being a part
of big stories...

28:12.778 --> 28:14.867
Mr. K lit something in me.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.271
All right,
this is the last of it.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.404
Nowcan I have my phone back?

28:30.447 --> 28:32.493
When you do the last
of your homework.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.844
Okay.

28:38.542 --> 28:41.241
You were off your
feet earlier.

28:41.284 --> 28:44.331
Yeah, I'm watching
my girlish figure.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.550
So, no worries
at work, huh?

28:48.378 --> 28:50.250
Eddie said something to you?

28:50.293 --> 28:53.035
Kid, I was PC.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.559
I got ears at the 2-9
and everywhere else.

28:57.431 --> 29:00.042
And a nose you don't mind
sticking where it doesn't belong.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.827
Sounds like you
inherited the gene,

29:01.870 --> 29:03.567
poking around
your precinct.

29:03.611 --> 29:04.873
Guy got shot 'cause of me.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.746
No, a guy got shot
because of someone else.

29:07.789 --> 29:11.227
But that's not the only thing
that's eating you.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.576
It isn't?

29:12.620 --> 29:13.621
Jamie.

29:15.884 --> 29:18.104
I don't know, maybe I'm just...

29:18.147 --> 29:20.976
not liking where I am
as much as I thought I'd be.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.021
Climbing the ladder.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.544
Yeah.

29:23.587 --> 29:26.503
As a patrol cop,
you get what you get...

29:26.547 --> 29:27.896
as it comes.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.246
You know, good or bad,
it's on you.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.770
Now... You got to pay

29:31.813 --> 29:32.988
for yoursins...

29:33.032 --> 29:35.034
and everyone else
who's under you.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.123
It's just a lot of plates
in the air,

29:37.166 --> 29:39.299
and you only got so many hands,
you know?

29:39.342 --> 29:41.344
Just don't make them into fists.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.260
What's that mean?

29:44.304 --> 29:47.307
I hear you've been stepping
on toes, like your brother.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.396
Danny gets results.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.442
I look at him
and I see a great detective.

29:52.486 --> 29:55.794
I look at you
and I see a future PC.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.100
Because of your strengths:

29:58.144 --> 29:59.623
Your heart,

29:59.667 --> 30:01.060
your smarts,

30:01.103 --> 30:02.626
the patience of a saint.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.019
Really?

30:04.063 --> 30:05.499
More genes you got from me.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.457
Oh.

30:07.501 --> 30:10.156
So get back to doing
what you're good at.

30:11.548 --> 30:15.465
Maybe you'll... see something
you never saw before.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.518
"Damn condom"?

30:24.561 --> 30:26.389
We were told that
you were overheard

30:26.433 --> 30:28.435
yelling those words
to Daria.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.089
So that little bitch eavesdrops,

30:30.132 --> 30:31.786
and now you think
that I killed Daria.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.179
"That little bitch"?

30:33.222 --> 30:35.964
Well, that little bitch
also said you have a temper,

30:36.008 --> 30:37.879
and you're not exactly
convincing us

30:37.923 --> 30:39.141
otherwise.

30:39.185 --> 30:41.883
Yes, fine, okay,
I did say "damn condom."

30:41.927 --> 30:43.624
Is that because she
forgot to throw it away

30:43.667 --> 30:45.036
after the two of you
slept together?

30:45.060 --> 30:46.583
Because that's
what a guest found

30:46.627 --> 30:48.735
when he checked in to a room
that she had marked as clean.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.500
So what was I supposed to do,

30:50.544 --> 30:52.198
make her employee of the month?

30:52.241 --> 30:54.461
So it was a work-related spat? Mm-hmm.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.593
And if you want proof
it wasn't me,

30:56.637 --> 30:58.117
when Daria died, I was...

30:58.160 --> 31:01.033
You were outside cleaning
dog crap off the sidewalk.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.035
We saw the security tapes.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.167
Elle and Toby
make me want to reverse

31:05.211 --> 31:07.169
our pet policy altogether.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.562
Speaking of her, where is she?

31:08.605 --> 31:10.956
Elle. Well,
you're not gonna talk to her again.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.411
She's the only person
around here who's willing

31:12.435 --> 31:14.022
to tell us the truth
about what the hell's

31:14.046 --> 31:16.875
going on here. Well, I-I don't keep tabs
on her.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.006
Well, who does?

31:18.050 --> 31:19.790
Uh, Sam?

31:19.834 --> 31:21.923
Have you seen Miss Copley?

31:21.967 --> 31:23.272
She left a while ago.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.883
To where?
I don't know. Sorry.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.667
She and Toby went shopping.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.191
I can give you her
number if you'd like.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.150
We would definitely like.
Yes, thank you.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.899
So?

31:40.942 --> 31:43.553
Can I get anyone a drink? We're on duty.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.381
A little wine,
then? We're in your apartment

31:45.425 --> 31:48.080
because of the confidential
nature of this meeting,

31:48.123 --> 31:49.516
but the protocol's the same

31:49.559 --> 31:52.127
as if we were in the
conference room of my office.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.868
So, no wine?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.304
No.Hmm.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.393
You... out.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.265
You, too. Out.

31:59.308 --> 32:01.049
I go where she goes.

32:01.093 --> 32:04.748
What I got to say,
I say only to you at this point.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.926
If it gets around in ways
we didn't want,

32:07.969 --> 32:10.450
then we know
who's shooting his mouth off.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.799
Or hers.

32:11.842 --> 32:12.931
Exactly.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.286
Ms. Reagan,
please, let's sit.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.641
So, who's on the audio,
and what was the deal?

32:27.684 --> 32:31.079
Well, the deal was
muscling a block and a half

32:31.123 --> 32:35.257
of mixed-use buildings adjacent
to the Hudson Yards project

32:35.301 --> 32:38.173
in anticipation
of soaring values,

32:38.217 --> 32:42.003
and... in collusion
with your office.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.396
Who's on the audio?

32:43.439 --> 32:45.093
Uh, me. And?

32:45.137 --> 32:46.442
You already know.

32:46.486 --> 32:48.314
No, I don't.Yeah, you do.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.968
You've been thinking it.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.839
You're just scared
to say it out loud.

32:53.449 --> 32:56.626
If you're talking about the
current D.A., all bets are off.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.324
Why is that? Because you're scamming me.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.456
You would have gone
directly to him,

33:00.500 --> 33:02.458
brokered your own jail time.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.157
You wouldn't have wanted
or needed a third party.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.076
Unless?

33:15.689 --> 33:19.040
Unless he screwed you on
the deal, and you want payback.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.042
That's very astute of you.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.131
It's very shortsighted of him.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.830
I can back it all up.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.919
On my mother's grave.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.531
And what do you expect me to do?

33:31.574 --> 33:34.403
Oh, see to it that I get
a more manageable stay

33:34.447 --> 33:36.362
at one of your
state's finer prisons.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.494
What do you consider manageable?

33:38.538 --> 33:40.757
Two, two and a half.

33:40.801 --> 33:43.195
Long enough so your
boss doesn't blink;

33:43.238 --> 33:45.980
Short enough, when
I can count days,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.808
I'm not crying like a baby.

33:50.245 --> 33:54.684
In exchange for which,
you alone get the evidence.

33:54.728 --> 33:57.339
In exchange for which,
you alone decide

33:57.383 --> 34:01.648
if the Manhattan D.A.'s
office stays dirty or...

34:01.691 --> 34:03.693
goes clean.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.659
Nothing.

34:12.702 --> 34:14.530
Where is she? Call her again.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.359
I called her. She said she
was on her way a while ago.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.667
Probably stopped to dream up
another go-nowhere lead for us.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.190
What's going on with you?

34:22.234 --> 34:24.366
Nothing.Something.

34:24.409 --> 34:26.542
I've never seen you so
skeptical about a witness.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.110
When I was growing up

34:29.154 --> 34:31.721
and my brother was in
and out of jail every day,

34:31.764 --> 34:34.898
my parents spent every
waking moment talking about him.

34:34.942 --> 34:37.118
So, I made stuff up.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.077
Anything and everything
to get attention.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.817
So that's what you
think this is about?

34:40.860 --> 34:42.428
She's trying to get attention?

34:42.471 --> 34:44.821
That's why she wants to help
us crack the case so bad? Yup.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.260
Like that. What next?

34:48.303 --> 34:50.217
Hi, Detectives!

34:50.262 --> 34:52.177
We'll just pull
back from her,

34:52.219 --> 34:53.786
come at it at a
different angle.

35:01.621 --> 35:02.839
I'm an NYPD detective.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.451
I need a bus forthwith
at the Beaumaire Hotel,

35:05.494 --> 35:07.627
442 West 38th Street.

35:08.932 --> 35:10.108
No.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.337
Billy, we need to talk.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.383
Didn't we already?

35:26.211 --> 35:28.038
I figured out
who stole my vest.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.692
Now I want help
bringing him in.

35:29.736 --> 35:30.954
From me?

35:30.998 --> 35:32.956
He is your son.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.481
You think my Pat
stole your vest?

35:35.524 --> 35:37.178
Took a look
at the security tapes.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.527
And didn't find
anything on 'em.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.529
Because when Pat came in
over the weekend,

35:40.573 --> 35:42.662
flashing a shield...
Your dupe, I'm guessing...

35:42.705 --> 35:44.664
It looked like
he belonged here.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.274
Boss, you're completely wrong.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.798
He was collared three times
in the past two years.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.060
Twice for heroin possession,

35:50.104 --> 35:52.019
and once for acting in concert

35:52.062 --> 35:53.803
with a buddy robbing people
at gunpoint.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.370
That's the shooter, right?

35:57.242 --> 35:59.548
Your son sold my vest to him?

36:01.071 --> 36:03.030
He's a good boy.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.233
When he's not letting drugs
make the decisions for him?

36:07.252 --> 36:09.341
I swear...

36:09.384 --> 36:11.604
I found out afterwards.

36:11.647 --> 36:14.737
He came in, bolt-cutters
under his coat,

36:14.781 --> 36:17.784
got by the front desk, saying
he was going up the squad.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.003
We're gonna go get Pat,

36:20.047 --> 36:22.832
and you and him are gonna tell
all of this to IAB.

36:22.876 --> 36:23.964
Please.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.748
My boy can't
go to prison.

36:25.792 --> 36:29.143
He barely survived jail the
couple of times he was in.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.842
And that's what I'll say
to the A.D.A.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.801
I'm not sure it'll help,
but we'll see.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.848
Yeah, you're sure?

36:38.892 --> 36:40.807
Van was found.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.374
Stolen, wiped down.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.027
Kids joyriding maybe?

36:44.071 --> 36:45.725
I-I got it.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.248
It's not kids joyriding.
It can't be.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.815
You think it's a coincidence

36:48.858 --> 36:51.097
that happened right when the
girl was about to talk to us?

36:51.121 --> 36:52.906
And on top of that,
TARU just told me

36:52.949 --> 36:54.516
that the security
tapes were doctored.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.277
That's who you were
on the phone with? Yeah.

36:56.301 --> 36:59.260
They said there were anomalies
and glitches in the timecode.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.369
Only one person could have
pulled that off. The one person

37:01.393 --> 37:03.873
over there who says everyone
in the hotel is like family?

37:03.917 --> 37:05.048
Only they're not.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.180
Let's go get him.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.182
Detectives?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.662
Speak of the devil.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.968
I have something to tell you.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.642
That you messed
with the security footage?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.276
Question is, how?

37:15.320 --> 37:17.322
I grew up in the hotel business.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.932
You learn tricks.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.335
Tricks,
like murdering housekeepers

37:20.368 --> 37:22.762
and innocent teenage girls?

37:22.805 --> 37:25.373
No, no, but I-I did panic

37:25.417 --> 37:28.115
about how Daria's murder
could ruin my career.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.377
Bet you did.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.466
And I stupidly covered
for who did kill her.

37:32.685 --> 37:35.209
And now he's murdered Elle, too.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.605
Who the hell are you
talking about if it's not you?

37:39.648 --> 37:41.781
Sam, our doorman.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.435
He and Daria had a thing.

37:43.478 --> 37:46.046
The condom that the guest found was theirs.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.614
But Sam thought that there was
more between them than she did.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.659
He thought Daria would
leave her family for him.

37:50.703 --> 37:51.984
When she told him
that she wouldn't,

37:52.008 --> 37:53.358
he strangled her.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.795
He came to me, crying,
said he put the sheet

37:55.838 --> 37:58.058
around her neck, made it look
like she had jumped.

37:58.101 --> 38:01.496
And then last night, when you
wanted to talk to Elle again...

38:01.540 --> 38:03.498
The one person
that I couldn't control...

38:03.542 --> 38:06.719
He must have totally lost
his mind, 'cause he ran off

38:06.762 --> 38:10.331
just a minute after you went
outside to wait for her.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.987
Hotel work is a lot lonelier
than you would think.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.989
You see these guests
having such a great time,

38:16.032 --> 38:17.469
families together.

38:17.512 --> 38:18.948
Sam just thought

38:18.992 --> 38:21.516
that he had finally found
all that for himself.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.265
Why are we here
and not your office?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.615
This is my other office. No,
this is myoffice.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.401
Sit down, please.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.580
This isn't yours.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.103
It is now.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.757
What's in it?

38:44.800 --> 38:47.455
Unofficial business.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.588
What's in it?

38:51.633 --> 38:53.592
Audio and video tapes,

38:53.635 --> 38:56.856
wire transfer records,
deed filing receipts,

38:56.899 --> 38:59.032
a penknife,

38:59.075 --> 39:00.642
a pack of Juicy Fruit.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.165
Vangelis?

39:03.428 --> 39:05.386
Kind of a re-gift.

39:07.257 --> 39:10.565
I need you to take this,
copy its contents,

39:10.609 --> 39:12.785
seal it with evidence
tape and voucher it.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.134
I can do that.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.266
Then go through
everything that you copied

39:16.310 --> 39:17.485
and see if it adds up.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.052
To what?

39:19.095 --> 39:21.663
Charges.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.404
Against who?

39:26.276 --> 39:28.235
You do the work,
and you tell me.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.715
You're really not gonna tell me?

39:29.758 --> 39:32.065
You have a name in mind. Just...

39:32.108 --> 39:35.068
keep an open mind.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.378
I can do that.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.739
Aah. Go to hell.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.785
Out of my way, old man.

39:58.352 --> 40:00.354
What's going on here?

40:02.356 --> 40:04.532
Mr. Heide.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.229
I know you.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.277
What are you doing here?

40:10.320 --> 40:13.454
Oh, just hanging out.

40:13.498 --> 40:16.109
Yeah, there's nothing
in that stupid law

40:16.152 --> 40:18.067
that says
that you get to inspect it

40:18.111 --> 40:20.113
by yourself.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.247
He's right about that.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.167
Don't mind us.

40:33.169 --> 40:35.215
Welcome.

40:37.783 --> 40:40.002
No, no, no, no, no, this...

40:40.046 --> 40:42.570
This ain't allowed.
Aren't you all cops, or...?

40:42.614 --> 40:45.312
Actually, I'm an assistant
district attorney.

40:47.357 --> 40:51.623
But none of us are here
in an official capacity.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.625
We're just here...

40:53.668 --> 40:55.627
as neighbors.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.107
We grew up right here
in Bay Ridge.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.501
A few blocks away.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.851
So it's a
neighborhood thing.

41:06.638 --> 41:10.032
See, we take care of our own.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.910
So...

41:17.953 --> 41:21.000
you lowlife scum...

41:21.043 --> 41:23.568
take your look around.
