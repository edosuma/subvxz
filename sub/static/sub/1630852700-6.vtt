WEBVTT

00:17.250 --> 00:18.750
So, let me get this straight.

00:18.833 --> 00:21.791
After Felipe's driver dropped you off
at the Josefina last night,

00:21.875 --> 00:24.166
this kid started following you?

00:25.083 --> 00:26.250
Not exactly.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.458
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

00:29.541 --> 00:34.375
After I got dropped off,
I walked over to the <i>Universidad</i> area.

00:34.458 --> 00:38.583
To this bar that I used to go to.
Back when I was involved with, um…

00:40.000 --> 00:41.291
Damían Abasolo.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.666
So, that little show
that you two put on for the Caleros--

00:46.750 --> 00:49.875
We recognized each other
the moment I walked into the room.

00:49.958 --> 00:52.125
Lucky for us, he didn't blow my cover.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.166
That's when I thought,

00:56.250 --> 00:58.291
"Damían would be
helpful in finding Gideon."

00:58.375 --> 00:59.708
And is he willing to help?

00:59.791 --> 01:02.458
-For a price.
-Money and a new identity.

01:02.541 --> 01:03.375
Exactly.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.958
Do you trust him?

01:06.041 --> 01:07.041
I do.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.083
We're making a deal with him.

01:11.166 --> 01:15.208
It doesn't matter, now that you're back
on police radar by killing this kid.

01:15.291 --> 01:17.666
Actually, I think
Jenny caught a break on this.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.250
Local Five-O
can't find anybody to talk to.

01:20.333 --> 01:23.083
All they know for sure
is this Tomás Alonso right here

01:23.166 --> 01:25.208
got in a fight with somebody on the train.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.916
But nobody wants to come forward
to describe that somebody. So…

01:29.875 --> 01:31.500
I'd say that's some Whisper shit.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.250
More like pure fucking luck.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.291
I didn't have a choice.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.125
If he'd got back to Felipe.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.041
Would've blown everything.

01:53.208 --> 01:56.541
We don't have a lot of time
before Felipe finds out about this.

01:59.375 --> 02:00.458
Fuck.

02:00.541 --> 02:04.791
I'll get Damían what he needs.
But what's his plan? Timetable?

02:04.875 --> 02:09.166
He's gonna send me an encrypted message
right after he meets Gideon face-to-face.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.541
And I'd expect that to be
in the next 24 hours.

02:30.958 --> 02:31.958
Are you okay?

02:34.250 --> 02:35.541
What do you think?

02:41.333 --> 02:42.791
I should go.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.333
Ah, fuck.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.958
I wish one of my exes
would give me fuck-you money

03:05.041 --> 03:06.333
and a push reset on my life.

03:06.416 --> 03:07.416
Yeah, well…

03:08.541 --> 03:10.666
he doesn't get shit if he doesn't deliver.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.250
Don't you ever talk to me like that!

03:46.166 --> 03:47.125
Becca.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.291
Honey, I really need
to talk to you, please.

03:58.875 --> 03:59.958
Go away.

04:02.791 --> 04:04.458
Becca, open the door, please.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.083
Look, I'll, um--

04:26.500 --> 04:29.291
I'll just be here whenever you're ready.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.791
-I am so sorry about--
-Forget it.

04:42.291 --> 04:43.333
It's not a big deal.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.833
It is a big deal.

04:46.625 --> 04:49.125
I should have never
lost my cool like that.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.083
Yeah. But…

04:52.708 --> 04:57.375
I should never have said,
you know, what I said.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.666
No. That does not matter.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.958
There is no excuse for what I did.

05:07.208 --> 05:12.208
And I promise you there is never
gonna be a day like yesterday. Okay?

05:13.916 --> 05:15.000
Sure.

05:15.083 --> 05:20.125
What do you say, maybe after practice,
we spend some time together?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.708
Just the two of us. Fresh start.

05:24.541 --> 05:30.500
Maybe. Um, I-I think practice is gonna
run pretty late today. So…

05:34.750 --> 05:36.041
Is that a tattoo?

05:37.875 --> 05:38.791
Yeah.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.125
Do you wanna see it?

05:45.458 --> 05:47.583
On your left, your weapons.

05:47.666 --> 05:51.208
Which, again,
hopefully you will not need to employ.

05:53.416 --> 05:54.541
Why, um…

05:57.458 --> 05:59.958
Why did you decide
to get a little bird like that?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.833
I thought it was cool.

06:04.416 --> 06:06.166
I wish you would've asked me first.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.541
I, um, I better
start getting ready for practice.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.958
But, I'll try and get out early.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.333
So we can hang out.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.291
That'd be great, honey.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.958
-I love you.
-Yeah, I love you too.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.250
-There you are.
-Hello.

07:27.041 --> 07:28.625
My mom would have killed you.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.041
And just for standing in your closet.

07:37.125 --> 07:40.583
What does she do if we had wild sex?

07:41.958 --> 07:44.291
Oh, my God. Don't even say that.

07:44.375 --> 07:47.166
I mean, she might still pop out
of nowhere and kill us both.

08:18.875 --> 08:19.750
What are you doing?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.958
Whoa.

08:22.708 --> 08:23.625
Nice picture.

08:25.791 --> 08:31.166
No, just curious.
About you. And about your mother.

08:33.250 --> 08:39.458
About what brings you two here
from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.708
I've gotta get to practice.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.583
You're sure you don't want me
to take you to your practice?

08:58.666 --> 09:00.791
Uh, no. The team has a shuttle bus.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.291
So when will I see you again?

09:03.166 --> 09:06.916
Hey, Becca. Who's your friend?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.375
Carmo.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.708
You speak Spanish?

09:10.291 --> 09:11.708
Yes, a little.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.541
Your friends are very pretty.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.125
Ah…

09:18.208 --> 09:19.250
<i>Gracias.</i>

09:21.333 --> 09:23.083
Hey, you know what?

09:23.958 --> 09:25.875
Still think you can
give me a lift to practice?

09:27.125 --> 09:28.416
Sure.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.708
You know I can.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.708
Thanks, baby.

09:39.791 --> 09:41.083
See you at the rink.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.541
Please, come in.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.541
-I have a surprise for you.
-Hmm.

10:16.625 --> 10:19.416
Well, this place is like a time capsule.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.375
Some things never change.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.625
Blini. Your favorite.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.750
Please, sit.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.708
I was hoping the surprise
would be Gideon's real name.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.750
Of course.

10:40.458 --> 10:44.625
Your American friend… Was he able to
get me my money? And my new identity?

10:44.708 --> 10:47.041
Your money was wired
to an account in Zürich.

10:48.166 --> 10:52.333
As far as your credentials and travel,
that's gonna take about 24 to 48 hours.

10:55.041 --> 10:59.166
So, while we wait, one drink?

11:04.750 --> 11:05.666
One.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.083
A toast.

11:19.166 --> 11:22.500
May we have everything
and not be punished for it.

11:34.666 --> 11:36.666
I understand
if you don't wanna share

11:36.750 --> 11:38.500
any information until everything is set.

11:38.583 --> 11:42.791
Anya. You and I both know that after
I tell you what you want to know,

11:42.875 --> 11:44.541
-I will never see you again.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.166
So, dance with me.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.458
Come on, Dima, no.

12:13.875 --> 12:18.500
You must excuse me if I indulge
these last few moments alone with you.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.125
-I hate this song.
-Me, too.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.333
-But it reminds me--
-I know.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.541
When we stole that Gold Simca.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.625
And came back here soaked from the rain.

12:38.708 --> 12:39.875
It was lovely.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.208
You weren't the one
who had to kneel on rice for three hours.

12:44.291 --> 12:46.041
What is pleasure without pain?

12:48.166 --> 12:49.000
Jeez.

12:50.541 --> 12:51.666
That was another life.

12:52.375 --> 12:53.791
Don't you miss that life?

12:55.833 --> 12:57.666
No. I'm sorry. I don't.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.875
I should check the kitchen.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.625
Chauncey. We got a situation.

13:17.708 --> 13:18.750
What happened?

13:18.833 --> 13:21.625
Jenny's ex just tazed her, man.
I just completely lost her feed.

13:21.708 --> 13:22.583
What?

13:24.125 --> 13:26.291
-Check her vitals.
-No. She's out cold, bro.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.708
-You got a location?
-Don't ask stupid questions.

13:28.791 --> 13:29.833
Let's go.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.333
-Damían.
-Tell me who the American is…

13:45.333 --> 13:48.333
or this rat will claw his way
through your intestines.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.500
Damían, please don't do this.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.458
Please don't do this.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.541
I know this isn't you.
Please.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.250
Keep fighting. Look at me.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.250
Look at me.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.750
Look into my eyes. Damían.

14:10.958 --> 14:14.250
Just tell me the name
of the American you're working with.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.500
No.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.125
Tell me the name.

14:17.958 --> 14:18.791
No.

14:22.791 --> 14:25.208
Tell me his name, please.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.125
<i>Nyet.</i>

14:26.208 --> 14:28.333
Just tell me
the goddamn name!

14:28.416 --> 14:29.333
No.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.375
-Please.
-Tell me the name.

14:40.416 --> 14:41.625
Then I stop.

14:53.416 --> 14:56.250
-The name?
-Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

14:56.916 --> 14:58.125
His name is…

15:01.375 --> 15:05.416
Again. Say it again, Anya. Speak up.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.791
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

15:36.958 --> 15:38.416
I'm here.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.125
-It's okay. Shh. It's okay.
-Anya.

15:45.333 --> 15:49.208
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

15:51.458 --> 15:52.583
Forgive me.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.125
<i>Repeat your message.</i>

16:24.166 --> 16:26.125
Repeat your message.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.500
Yaroslav. It is not here.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.833
That is impossible.

16:30.916 --> 16:33.166
They couldn't have
withdrawn it from the building.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.166
<i>What should I do?</i>

16:42.125 --> 16:44.458
You will go now to the guest quarters.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.041
Find Dr. Artur Orlov.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.625
<i>Find him. And kill him.</i>

16:49.375 --> 16:52.333
But if I kill Dr. Orlov
how will we find the exemplar?

16:53.166 --> 16:56.625
<i>Do not question me. Go. Now.</i>

17:04.583 --> 17:05.625
Look at you.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.333
You like it?

17:12.916 --> 17:14.625
Like it?

17:14.708 --> 17:17.333
I helped Su-Yin pick it out.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.166
Really?

17:19.250 --> 17:20.333
Mm-hmm.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.000
I've been looking for you.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.166
Well. That makes two of us.

17:41.625 --> 17:45.666
So, was your plan to leave
the poor guy tied up all night?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.291
Mm-hmm.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.291
Stop smiling. It was really mean.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.916
I'll stop smiling when you stop smiling.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.083
<i>Do not get distracted.</i>

17:56.166 --> 17:59.083
<i>You use the girl to get to her father.</i>

17:59.166 --> 18:00.875
I was hoping that you and me…

18:00.958 --> 18:03.208
We could have some time alone…

18:04.333 --> 18:06.583
But if you want to go get him…

18:06.666 --> 18:10.208
Come. The guards will be
making their rounds soon.

18:24.416 --> 18:26.083
However you clean this up…

18:30.791 --> 18:32.666
Make sure you treat him with respect.

18:36.666 --> 18:37.625
I will.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.333
Holy shit!

18:40.125 --> 18:42.875
Come on, man. All this.
And you're scared of a rat?

18:43.750 --> 18:47.416
That thing was clawing out her intestines
two minutes ago. All right?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.166
It wasn't the rat's fault.

18:50.250 --> 18:54.166
Just like it wasn't Damían's fault.
Somebody was controlling his mind.

18:54.750 --> 18:58.125
I could see it in his eyes
just like I could see it in Lidia's eyes.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.375
Guys. I just decrypted something
we can use here.

19:03.458 --> 19:06.291
This e-mail says Damían
is supposed to get picked up for a meeting

19:06.375 --> 19:09.083
with Gideon and the Caleros
at their estate. This afternoon.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.791
And I bet they're expecting
the delivery of the bomb.

19:12.791 --> 19:14.583
Along with my American contact.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.333
Chris, do you think you can finish
what Damían started here?

19:18.916 --> 19:20.250
Oh, you know I can.

19:20.875 --> 19:23.625
But, wait. Hold up.
You want me to give these boys a bomb?

19:23.708 --> 19:26.291
I want a bomb. Hold the boom.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.333
Well, that I can do that.

19:28.416 --> 19:30.416
Plus, throw in a GPS tracker
while I'm at it.

19:32.833 --> 19:36.875
And… After everything
you've been through, I hate to ask, but--

19:36.958 --> 19:40.583
I don't have a choice.
Damían has to deliver the bomb.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.875
That's great! Love the effort, Becca!

20:24.875 --> 20:28.625
See that? That's what I expect
to see from all of you from now on.

20:28.708 --> 20:32.541
When a teammate like Claire goes down,
it's up to each and every one of you

20:32.625 --> 20:36.000
to step it up
and bring your A game to the ice!

20:36.083 --> 20:37.583
Just like Becca just did.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.708
Ladies. Let's hear some team spirit.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.625
Give it up for Becca.

20:43.750 --> 20:47.250
-Whoa, way to stick that landing.
-Yeah, Becca!

20:48.291 --> 20:50.708
Yeah. 'Cause you always
got that big ass to catch you.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.416
Remember. We practice as we perform.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.500
Good work, Becca.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.291
-Teamwork.

21:06.958 --> 21:07.958
Whoa.

21:14.916 --> 21:16.958
-Spectacular.
-Thank you.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.625
Rebecca Franklin?

21:20.666 --> 21:21.541
Yes?

21:22.833 --> 21:25.291
It is certainly an honor to meet you.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.125
My name is Svetlana.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.333
Oh.

21:28.416 --> 21:29.666
You can call me Becca.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.291
And, and this is my friend, Carmo.

21:32.375 --> 21:36.291
I own this facility.
And I'm helping to sponsor the tournament.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.708
Oh. Cool. Thank you.

21:38.791 --> 21:44.500
I had to come over to tell you how much
I enjoy watching you perform on the ice.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.000
You are truly an extraordinary skater.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.541
You're very kind.

21:50.625 --> 21:55.250
I'd say, that kind of talent
only emerges from one place.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.250
Are you Russian?

21:58.958 --> 21:59.916
I'm sorry?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.333
You were born in Russia?

22:02.666 --> 22:05.250
No, I-I mean…

22:06.666 --> 22:07.750
I don't think so.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.500
You don't know where you come from?

22:11.625 --> 22:14.250
I mean, I was born in the US.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.958
My dad's side of the family came over
from England like a thousand years ago.

22:20.291 --> 22:23.750
But on my mom's side,
I really don't know. Maybe.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.666
My mom never tells me anything.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.375
That's a shame.

22:30.458 --> 22:33.333
But I would imagine
she's proud of your talent.

22:34.416 --> 22:35.333
Yeah.

22:36.208 --> 22:40.250
Well, I do look forward
to watching you compete, my dear.

22:40.958 --> 22:43.208
Thank you. I appreciate that.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.375
Very nice to meet you.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.125
Same.

23:32.458 --> 23:34.291
Gideon will be arriving shortly.

23:34.375 --> 23:35.250
Yes. That's good.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.625
Welcome, Damían. Please take a seat.

23:40.791 --> 23:43.541
I have the device for you
and Becca's identity for Gideon.

23:44.375 --> 23:45.500
Becca?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.791
The American operative is female?

23:53.625 --> 23:55.625
No. I'm sorry. I misspoke.

23:55.708 --> 23:57.208
But he's working with a woman.

23:59.375 --> 24:00.333
He was.

24:00.416 --> 24:04.833
But as Gideon and I negotiated,
I took care of the matter. Free of charge.

24:04.916 --> 24:06.125
You're welcome.

24:07.458 --> 24:08.708
When was that?

24:09.416 --> 24:10.916
This morning.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.416
She was following you?

24:12.500 --> 24:14.250
Not anymore.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.458
Is Sara here by any chance?

24:17.583 --> 24:20.458
Sara? Gideon would not approve.

24:21.791 --> 24:24.291
Well, here it is. As you ordered.

24:24.833 --> 24:25.833
Great.

24:26.416 --> 24:28.041
Show us how it works.

24:28.916 --> 24:32.833
So, it resembles the ornamental tchotchkes
that decorate the target location.

24:33.583 --> 24:39.333
I thought it best that it appear like
something you could display at the museum.

24:40.666 --> 24:41.625
It looks priceless.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.041
Yes, it does.

24:43.791 --> 24:45.208
It's pretty much idiot-proof.

24:45.291 --> 24:48.458
It has a directional
blast radius of 40 meters.

24:48.541 --> 24:51.541
And a limited
remote distance of 100 meters.

24:53.208 --> 24:56.708
Plus, at no extra charge,
we got their requested safety feature.

24:56.791 --> 25:00.375
As you asked,
it can only be detonated remotely.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.958
Engaging this button right here. And then…

25:10.916 --> 25:14.083
stepping 60 meters away
you will set off the explosion.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.625
Excellent.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.833
Is there a kill switch?
Should we need to abort.

25:17.916 --> 25:19.333
We will not abort.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.791
Are you okay?

25:22.666 --> 25:23.791
Do you need some water?

25:26.500 --> 25:27.375
Yes, thank you.

25:32.833 --> 25:35.500
The prime minister will be attending
a reception tomorrow night

25:35.583 --> 25:37.541
at the Museo Lázaro Galdiano.

25:37.625 --> 25:43.375
And we already have a recruit working as
a member of the museum's security detail.

25:43.458 --> 25:47.125
So, we will need another
to deliver the device.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.791
Mm-hmm. It should've been Tomás.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.666
We have another.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.916
The American murdered Tomás
in a subway station last night.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.416
Murdered?

25:57.500 --> 25:58.625
Mm-hmm.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.833
Are the police involved?

26:00.916 --> 26:02.500
The police believe our Tomás

26:02.583 --> 26:05.500
was just involved
in a drunken fight on a metro train.

26:09.666 --> 26:14.416
Still, police involvement of any kind
is not something I am comfortable with.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.541
Neither is Gideon.

26:16.625 --> 26:20.125
I assure you. I have things under control.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.541
She don't look good, man.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.666
-I know.
-No. We should get her out of there.

26:27.333 --> 26:30.083
Wait, wait. Just… Just give it a sec.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.541
May I use your bathroom?

26:39.625 --> 26:43.250
Sure. Across the foyer. On your right.

26:48.625 --> 26:51.125
Guys. I'm trying to…

26:52.583 --> 26:55.250
hold this form…

26:56.666 --> 26:58.500
I can't hold it any longer.

27:00.416 --> 27:01.416
<i>Jenny.</i>

27:04.625 --> 27:05.916
<i>Jenny, talk to me.</i>

27:07.708 --> 27:09.291
<i>Find her father.</i>

27:12.458 --> 27:13.916
Where's your father?

27:16.458 --> 27:18.083
Don't worry. He won't bother us.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.625
Sit with me.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.250
Can I use your bathroom?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.083
Of course.

27:33.416 --> 27:34.250
It's there.

27:35.875 --> 27:36.791
Mm-hmm.

27:42.375 --> 27:44.958
Now is not the time to get emotional.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.958
Focus on your job.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.000
She may be your first, but she
will most certainly not be your last.

27:55.958 --> 27:58.000
<i>Her father must be exterminated.</i>

28:18.416 --> 28:19.416
Anya?

28:21.208 --> 28:22.208
Anichka?

28:23.958 --> 28:27.416
There is something wrong
with the connection. Get her back up. Now.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.333
Comrade Petrova,
I am unable to re-establish contact.

28:30.416 --> 28:31.916
Try again.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.083
There's nothing wrong with the connection.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.333
She must've turned it off.

30:04.083 --> 30:05.500
What's the matter?

30:07.250 --> 30:08.666
Why are you laughing?

30:09.333 --> 30:10.750
Have you ever done this before?

30:12.416 --> 30:13.458
Have you?

30:15.875 --> 30:16.791
No.

30:18.041 --> 30:19.583
Uh-huh.

30:19.666 --> 30:20.708
It shows.

30:22.541 --> 30:23.958
Go away, you.

31:11.750 --> 31:12.833
Be quiet.

31:43.750 --> 31:44.916
Chauncey.

31:45.958 --> 31:49.375
Jenny, do you think that
there is any way that you can morph back?

31:49.458 --> 31:53.458
<i>Chauncey… No… I can't.</i>

31:56.208 --> 31:58.708
Guys. We got an SUV
coming up the drive to the house.

32:01.416 --> 32:02.791
-It's Gideon.
-Come on.

32:04.791 --> 32:08.583
Come on. Move your ass, man.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.083
I can't get a clear shot of Gideon's face.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.166
Jenny. Listen to me.

32:14.875 --> 32:17.125
You have to find a way
out of there right now.

32:17.208 --> 32:21.041
<i>No. Shut the fuck up for a second.</i>
<i>I can figure something out here.</i>

32:29.500 --> 32:33.125
Jenny. Please. Get out of there.

32:34.375 --> 32:36.083
Gideon is in the next room.

32:36.166 --> 32:40.166
<i>And if you stay, your cover</i>
<i>will be blown, and you will be dead.</i>

32:40.250 --> 32:43.208
God damn it.
We gotta find another way.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.500
I know. Once you're outside,

32:44.583 --> 32:47.333
head north to the crest line.
We're on the access road.

32:49.166 --> 32:53.125
Okay. I'll be right there.

32:54.833 --> 32:56.458
Where is Abasolo?

32:56.541 --> 32:58.583
-He's in the bathroom.
-How long?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.875
-I'm not sure--
-Get him.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.416
Damían.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.916
Damían, come on. Gideon is here.

33:19.750 --> 33:23.166
Damían! Open the door! Damían, now!

33:56.250 --> 33:57.666
Shit! She's not gonna make it.

34:00.625 --> 34:02.041
No. She's got this.

34:02.125 --> 34:05.041
-She needs our help. I'm going out.
-Chris, sit the fuck down!

34:13.500 --> 34:16.083
-Where the fuck are you guys?
-<i>Fifty meters, west.</i>

34:29.750 --> 34:32.583
I warned you. You goddamn fool.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.416
I told you what this woman was capable of.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.791
I told you what to look for
in Abasolo's behavior.

34:39.875 --> 34:45.458
Gideon. I assure you,
my men will catch up with this imposter.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.166
Felipe. I will take care of her now.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.208
So, listen to me.

34:51.291 --> 34:55.791
If you and your brother fail to hold up
your part of our arrangement,

34:55.875 --> 35:00.208
I promise you, I will burn
this house down along with you

35:00.291 --> 35:02.458
and every last Los Jinetes.

35:04.416 --> 35:05.875
Do you understand?

35:21.916 --> 35:25.625
Based on what I'm seeing
there's nothing physically wrong with you.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.166
I mean, maybe it's her diet?

35:28.916 --> 35:30.333
I'm just saying.

35:30.416 --> 35:35.958
Look, we all know this little
performance anxiety is mental.

35:37.833 --> 35:40.083
So, what's going on between you and Becca?

35:42.291 --> 35:43.333
Nothing.

35:44.333 --> 35:45.208
Nothing?

35:46.166 --> 35:47.458
Did I stutter?

35:48.958 --> 35:51.208
Well, speaking of slips of the tongue,

35:51.291 --> 35:54.291
you let Becca's name
slip right out in front of Felipe.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.833
So, what would Freud say?

35:56.916 --> 35:59.166
He would say
that I was worried about Becca.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.166
'Cause he's a fucking genius.

36:01.250 --> 36:04.500
Look… I don't have kids.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.791
But having to worry
about your daughter's well-being

36:06.875 --> 36:10.000
has gotta put a lot
of stress on your system.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.000
I'm sure you'd love
to tell me, "I told you so."

36:18.083 --> 36:20.250
-What? You think I'm ten years old?
-Well…

36:23.333 --> 36:24.875
You did tell me so.

36:29.625 --> 36:34.083
Is this just between the two of you?
Or is someone threatening Becca?

36:38.875 --> 36:39.708
Not sure.

36:42.958 --> 36:44.083
I can't tell.

36:45.125 --> 36:48.000
Call it a mother's intuition, but…

36:48.791 --> 36:51.416
Things are escalating.
It's getting too dangerous.

36:51.500 --> 36:55.166
I gotta get Becca
as far away from here as possible.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.791
-As soon as possible.
-Whoa. Whoa.

36:56.875 --> 36:57.916
Oh, son of a bitch.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.208
-It's all right. It's all right.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.916
There you go. Come on.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.416
It's all right. Come on.

37:04.125 --> 37:06.791
No, Chris. It's not all right.
I gotta get to Becca.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.375
You need to recover. Okay?

37:08.458 --> 37:11.958
And let me keep an eye on Becca.
Just for now.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
Until you can get back on your feet.
She's at practice, right?

37:16.083 --> 37:18.083
Don't let her see you.
She thinks we're fucking.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.250
Ooh. Oh.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.750
Okay. Wow.

37:20.833 --> 37:23.500
Um, I will be much better
at maintaining my cover.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.500
Yeah, uh, and, um, as soon as
you're feeling up to it,

37:28.166 --> 37:32.291
we can start making whatever arrangements
you need to send Becca home or…

37:32.375 --> 37:34.375
wherever you feel like
she's gonna be safe.

37:36.708 --> 37:38.208
Look, just rest up and…

37:40.083 --> 37:40.958
trust me.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.041
Oh, fuck.

38:14.791 --> 38:16.833
Good work, Ptichka.

38:16.916 --> 38:20.541
With the tracking device in the pendant,
we can map out the embassy.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.333
My love.

39:51.708 --> 39:55.750
I wish that I could destroy this.

39:55.833 --> 39:56.666
But…

39:58.250 --> 39:59.375
it is…

40:00.833 --> 40:03.208
our only way to get free of this place.

40:06.416 --> 40:08.458
It is also difficult because…

40:11.625 --> 40:15.708
There remains
a part of you in all of this.

41:12.625 --> 41:15.041
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…

41:21.791 --> 41:22.666
No.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.041
No, no, no.

42:16.625 --> 42:20.041
After you get dressed,
I wanna show you a special place.

42:20.125 --> 42:21.541
Out near San Cristóbal.

42:22.333 --> 42:25.833
Uh, I can't. I promised my mom
that we'd spend some time together.

42:25.916 --> 42:29.291
Oh, really? Come on. Don't disappoint me.

42:31.875 --> 42:36.041
Okay. Look. Let me get changed.
And then we can talk about it.

42:38.166 --> 42:39.208
I'll meet you outside.

42:40.791 --> 42:41.791
Okay.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.208
What up, man?

43:16.291 --> 43:18.291
<i>Carmo Valter</i>
<i>is here at the rink.</i>

43:18.375 --> 43:20.208
-Oh, shit.
-<i>Where's Jenny?</i>

43:20.291 --> 43:21.416
She's asleep, man.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.666
Good. She doesn't need to know about this.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.083
Not yet, anyway.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.583
<i>But I need you down here, ASAP.</i>
<i>I'm going after him.</i>

43:27.666 --> 43:29.250
<i>I'm heading to the maintenance area.</i>

43:29.333 --> 43:32.125
I hear you, but I know
I'm not all the backup you're gonna need.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.125
Just get down here.

43:33.208 --> 43:34.458
Damn.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.583
What's going on?

43:37.666 --> 43:38.875
With what?

43:40.333 --> 43:41.916
-Chris.
-Look…

43:42.000 --> 43:45.416
Nothing. Chaunce just wants me
to bring the van down, set up,

43:45.500 --> 43:47.958
make sure the area is safe. You know.

43:48.041 --> 43:49.125
Don't lie to me.

43:50.041 --> 43:52.083
Don't look at me like that.

43:53.041 --> 43:54.541
Is Becca okay?

43:54.625 --> 43:56.750
-I-I think so. But--
-But what?

43:58.250 --> 43:59.708
The Jackals know where she is.

43:59.791 --> 44:01.291
Get your fucking keys now.

44:02.208 --> 44:04.541
Oh, God. Just like my mama all over again.

44:04.625 --> 44:05.958
Come on, Chris. Let's go.

44:06.041 --> 44:07.958
Yes, ma'am. I'm coming right now.

44:26.791 --> 44:27.916
Is he picking up?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.958
Keeps going to voice mail.
But according to GPS he's still inside.

44:31.041 --> 44:33.000
Either standing guard
or getting his ass kicked.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.250
Chauncey. Take care of Chauncey.

45:14.625 --> 45:15.708
Damn, Chaunce.

45:15.791 --> 45:19.333
Hey, hey, hey, it's all right.
It's all right. I got you.

45:19.916 --> 45:21.125
Oh, fuck.

45:57.041 --> 46:00.625
Who are you working for?
Who are you working for?

46:03.041 --> 46:04.875
Who are you fucking working for?

46:20.541 --> 46:26.500
We play the parts.
And this is mine, Ptichka.

46:31.125 --> 46:32.541
My little bird.

46:33.791 --> 46:34.666
Svetlana.

46:36.333 --> 46:37.583
No!

46:49.916 --> 46:52.125
Becca! Becca!

46:56.500 --> 46:57.750
-Becca!
-Mrs. Franklin?

46:58.333 --> 46:59.416
Maddie, where is Becca?

46:59.500 --> 47:03.083
She's not here, Mrs. Franklin.
She went out, got a ride to the hotel.

47:03.166 --> 47:04.083
A ride from whom?

47:04.666 --> 47:07.666
I don't know. But maybe that guy
with the motorcycle?

47:09.500 --> 47:12.666
Are you okay?
Is Becca okay? Mrs. Franklin?

47:28.000 --> 47:29.208
What the fuck, Mom?

47:29.291 --> 47:32.500
I don't know why you and dad got divorced.
Or anything about you.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.541
What is the big secret?

47:36.041 --> 47:37.166
I love you. You know that?

47:37.250 --> 47:39.666
Yeah, but sometimes you say it
and I'm not sure you mean it.

47:39.750 --> 47:40.791
What?

47:40.875 --> 47:43.750
<i>Maybe a little space on this trip</i>
<i>is the best for both of us.</i>

47:43.833 --> 47:46.541
<i>Suddenly, you care? You literally</i>
<i>have no idea what's going on.</i>

47:46.625 --> 47:49.000
-Don't you ever talk to me like that!

47:52.041 --> 47:55.166
We can spend some time together.
Just the two of us. Fresh start.

48:08.291 --> 48:11.208
Becca? Becca!

48:24.541 --> 48:26.166
Come on, baby. Where are you?

48:31.666 --> 48:32.833
Okay.

48:35.083 --> 48:35.958
What?

48:38.208 --> 48:40.083
What the fuck! No!

48:40.750 --> 48:41.750
No!

48:43.333 --> 48:45.375
Fuck! Fuck.

48:46.333 --> 48:48.583
-Please, baby. Pick up.

48:51.208 --> 48:52.416
Please pick up.

48:54.208 --> 48:55.958
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

48:56.041 --> 48:58.583
<i>But if you know me,</i>
<i>why aren't you texting?</i>

49:03.208 --> 49:04.125
No.

49:10.125 --> 49:12.291
<i>No!</i>
