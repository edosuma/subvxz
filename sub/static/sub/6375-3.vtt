00:01.976 --> 00:03.773
<i>Previously
on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:03.844 --> 00:05.038
<i>You're dating a married man?</i>

00:05.112 --> 00:06.340
You think that doesn't tear me up?

00:06.413 --> 00:08.347
- Well, then walk away!
- I can't!

00:08.415 --> 00:09.507
I'm in love with him!

00:09.583 --> 00:11.210
Are you offering me a job?

00:11.285 --> 00:12.377
You will be my protégé.

00:12.453 --> 00:15.286
- But that's Marc's job.
And now it's yours.

00:15.356 --> 00:16.914
Stuart, what are you doing here?

00:16.991 --> 00:18.015
What's wrong?

00:18.092 --> 00:19.616
- I think he's doing drugs again.
- What?

00:19.693 --> 00:20.990
I was on that trip with you in Paris.

00:21.095 --> 00:22.858
I remember you drooling
all over his mother.

00:22.963 --> 00:25.625
Your son's grandparents in France
filed a claim for custody.

00:25.733 --> 00:27.997
I want to stay with my father.

00:28.068 --> 00:29.057
I've made a decision.

00:29.169 --> 00:30.500
Tonight, we are welcoming back,

00:30.571 --> 00:33.665
<i>as Editor-in-Chief of Mode,
Daniel Meade!</i>

00:33.741 --> 00:36.141
Don't forget,
I still own a third of this company.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.735
You would be nothing
without that baby.

00:38.812 --> 00:40.109
You can't push me aside.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:52.793 --> 00:55.455
Um... Is that light really necessary?

00:59.466 --> 01:00.558
Sorry, Miss Suarez.

01:00.634 --> 01:03.262
That's okay.
Believe me, no one wants to know

01:03.337 --> 01:05.202
what happened to Christina
more than I do.

01:05.272 --> 01:08.070
About that, do you have any idea
where Mr. Meade was last night?

01:08.142 --> 01:09.666
Um...

01:09.910 --> 01:13.346
Do I know where Daniel was last night?

01:15.249 --> 01:16.944
Um...

01:24.124 --> 01:26.092
- Hi, Dad!
- Morning, sweetheart!

01:26.160 --> 01:28.685
Are we going to do this every morning?

01:28.796 --> 01:30.525
Hey, I miss you at breakfast!

01:30.631 --> 01:33.725
But I'm sure you're having a great
breakfast in your own apartment.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.734
- It's great.
- I can't help it.

01:35.803 --> 01:38.271
I still worry about you,
by yourself in the big city.

01:38.372 --> 01:40.135
Do you think you have
enough locks on your door?

01:40.207 --> 01:41.435
I have plenty.

01:41.508 --> 01:43.339
And I grew up in the big city,
remember?

01:43.410 --> 01:46.902
There's no need to be
so protective of... My umbrella!

01:46.980 --> 01:48.845
<i>Why would I be protective
of your umbrella?</i>

01:48.916 --> 01:52.079
No, I left my umbrella outside
my apartment and now it's gone.

01:52.152 --> 01:54.052
<i>Amor, you're too trusting.</i>

01:54.121 --> 01:57.181
You leave your umbrella outside
your apartment, people will steal it.

01:57.257 --> 02:00.661
I'm sure somebody just borrowed it.
My neighbors are really nice.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.822
Sounds a lot like your bike
in the seventh grade.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.330
Okay, those guys totally said
that they would bring it back!

02:05.399 --> 02:06.991
And it's fine if someone
borrowed my umbrella,

02:07.101 --> 02:09.092
'cause I don't need it today, anyway.

02:11.872 --> 02:13.840
- You look different.
- I'm wet.

02:13.907 --> 02:15.534
Big improvement.

02:16.410 --> 02:18.207
Good morning, Daniels!

02:18.278 --> 02:22.180
What is popping, shortie?
Super tight! I am outie five-k!

02:24.151 --> 02:27.416
Everyone at school listens to hip hop,
so he's sort of been studying up.

02:27.488 --> 02:29.285
Well, he is a fast learner.

02:29.356 --> 02:32.223
<i>All right, Daniel,
your first day back at Mode.</i>

02:32.292 --> 02:33.384
- Schedule.
- Thank you.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.621
- Mail.
- That's it?

02:35.729 --> 02:38.459
Yep, the rest of it got forwarded
to Alexis, but I'm on it, don't worry.

02:38.565 --> 02:41.659
And I also thought that I would go
do a dry-cleaning run for you,

02:41.769 --> 02:44.932
since you're off the tracksuits. Yay!

02:45.005 --> 02:47.496
Great. Can you have my raincoat
dry-cleaned while you're at it?

02:49.576 --> 02:51.976
Hello, Dusty!

02:52.045 --> 02:54.309
And I was supposed
to get my mom home last night,

02:54.381 --> 02:55.905
but I ended up leaving the party early,

02:55.983 --> 02:58.178
so if anyone asks, you can just say

02:58.252 --> 03:01.779
<i>we were here late packing up
at Player magazine.</i>

03:01.855 --> 03:03.117
<i>But we weren't at Player.</i>

03:03.190 --> 03:06.023
I know. I just thought
it was the simplest explanation.

03:06.093 --> 03:07.685
Well, why don't you just say
where you really were?

03:07.795 --> 03:08.819
Wouldn't that be simpler?

03:08.929 --> 03:13.093
Because I was...
Because it's not a big deal.

03:14.635 --> 03:17.126
People, I have
an announcement to make!

03:17.237 --> 03:20.798
This is urgent! I have important news!

03:20.874 --> 03:22.603
Wilhelmina Slater is in the hospital!

03:23.811 --> 03:26.575
It's okay.
She's only there because last night,

03:26.647 --> 03:31.380
her surrogate, Christina, fell down
the stairs and is unconscious.

03:31.451 --> 03:32.884
What?

03:32.953 --> 03:36.719
Don't worry, the baby
and Wilhelmina are fine.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.951
Marc! What about Christina?

03:39.026 --> 03:42.393
I'm sure that she's...
You know what? I didn't ask.

03:56.777 --> 03:58.574
Christina?

03:58.645 --> 04:00.613
Hi, it's Betty.

04:00.681 --> 04:02.273
Hey, Betty.

04:02.349 --> 04:05.750
Are you all right? What happened?

04:07.287 --> 04:11.986
I don't remember. It's a bit fuzzy.

04:12.059 --> 04:16.119
I was leaving the party.
I'd had an awful time.

04:16.228 --> 04:21.826
And I was at the top of the stairs, and...

04:24.337 --> 04:26.999
And then someone pushed me.

04:27.073 --> 04:28.301
What?

04:29.108 --> 04:31.008
<i>SUZUKl: Baby. Mama.</i>

04:32.311 --> 04:34.279
<i>Rumors are swirling
ever since the surrogate</i>

04:34.347 --> 04:37.248
<i>carrying Wilhelmina Slater and
Bradford Meade's latent love child</i>

04:37.316 --> 04:40.649
fell down the stairs.
Or was she pushed?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.347
With Meade in the balance,

04:42.421 --> 04:45.185
everyone wants to know
who could have done such a thing.

04:45.258 --> 04:48.625
The millionaire playboy?
The tranny CEO?

04:48.728 --> 04:51.196
The angry matriarch
acquitted of murder?

04:51.264 --> 04:54.859
Or any one of Wilhelmina's
many close frenemies?

04:54.967 --> 04:58.562
<i>La Slater lost no time in trying
to help authorities find the culprit.</i>

04:58.638 --> 05:03.166
I will not rest until the person who
threatened the life of my unborn child...

05:03.242 --> 05:04.607
And others.

05:04.877 --> 05:08.244
...and others, is brought to justice.

05:08.314 --> 05:12.717
So I am offering a reward of $ 100,000
to anyone

05:12.785 --> 05:18.348
with information leading
to the apprehension of this monster!

05:19.325 --> 05:21.919
This is a huge opportunity.

05:22.028 --> 05:23.359
The more they talk about this,

05:23.462 --> 05:26.989
<i>the less they talk about the poor sales
of my first issue of Mode.</i>

05:27.099 --> 05:30.535
Still, Willie, doesn't it worry you a little,
this whole situation?

05:30.603 --> 05:32.503
Well, of course I'm worried, Marc.

05:32.571 --> 05:36.063
But when someone gives you chintz,
you can do two things.

05:36.142 --> 05:39.043
A, whine about the fact
that it's an upholstery fabric,

05:39.111 --> 05:43.207
or, B, turn it into
a fabulous bolero jacket.

05:43.282 --> 05:45.580
Okay, you're a diabolical
fashion genius,

05:45.651 --> 05:47.516
and I'm delighted to be
your first assistant again,

05:47.586 --> 05:53.388
but your baby and others
are in the hospital.

05:53.459 --> 05:56.986
- I know they're okay, but...
- Marc, you're right.

05:57.096 --> 06:00.532
At the end of the day,
it's about my child.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.897
Now, we'll have to make sure
the press knows that.

06:02.969 --> 06:05.563
We need speeches, vigils,
long nights at the hospital

06:05.638 --> 06:07.162
with our Scottish rent-a-womb.

06:07.239 --> 06:11.471
We'll have to make sure
they don't forget the real victim here.

06:11.544 --> 06:12.875
The baby.

06:13.346 --> 06:14.608
Me!

06:14.680 --> 06:15.977
You...

06:17.783 --> 06:21.241
<i>Hello, Mode magazine.
You'll have to call back.</i>

06:21.320 --> 06:23.254
Detective Averaimo.
I'm here to question people about...

06:23.322 --> 06:24.687
- I did it.
- Excuse me?

06:24.757 --> 06:29.558
And now, you have to interrogate me
for, like, hours and hours.

06:29.662 --> 06:31.721
And I do not break easy.

06:33.032 --> 06:34.693
I'm totally easy.

06:35.768 --> 06:38.236
Detective Averaimo? Betty Suarez.

06:38.337 --> 06:39.895
We're going to set you up
in the conference room.

06:39.972 --> 06:41.872
But I'm guilty! Where are you going?

06:41.941 --> 06:46.241
Just so you know, the victim,
Christina McKinney, is my best friend.

06:46.312 --> 06:49.645
Don't worry, Miss Suarez.
We're taking this case very seriously.

06:49.715 --> 06:52.013
The attempted murder
of a woman and her unborn child...

06:52.084 --> 06:55.576
Well, if there's anything else that I can
do for you, please just let me know.

06:55.654 --> 06:59.317
Yeah, well, you could start
by answering a few questions.

07:04.063 --> 07:07.157
Um... Is that light really necessary?

07:08.834 --> 07:10.301
Sorry, Miss Suarez.

07:10.403 --> 07:14.100
Do I know where Daniel was last night?

07:14.173 --> 07:15.197
Um...

07:15.274 --> 07:17.538
You know, after the party.

07:18.944 --> 07:20.275
I'm not really sure.

07:20.346 --> 07:25.909
You see, he sort of asked me
to say he was working late

07:25.985 --> 07:29.011
if anyone, you know, asked.

07:30.456 --> 07:32.185
He asked you to lie?

07:33.559 --> 07:38.963
No, no, not a lie.
More of a small untruth.

07:40.399 --> 07:42.924
Excuse me. Yeah?

07:43.936 --> 07:47.064
No. I think I just found
a very promising lead.

07:52.511 --> 07:54.706
He said "very promising lead,"

07:54.780 --> 07:59.183
and then he circled and underlined
Daniel's name! It's all my fault!

07:59.251 --> 08:01.981
Speaking of which, I've been
watching a lot of cop shows lately,

08:02.054 --> 08:05.820
and that Mariska Hargitay
wears some amazing pantsuits.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.623
I'm just trying to keep things upbeat.

08:08.727 --> 08:12.128
Sweetheart, I'm sure if he circled
and underlined Daniel's name,

08:12.198 --> 08:14.496
the detective had a pretty good reason.

08:14.567 --> 08:17.434
Dad, he only thinks Daniel's guilty
because of something I said!

08:17.503 --> 08:20.063
It's not like Daniel could
ever do something like that.

08:20.139 --> 08:23.199
Well, if Daniel's innocent, then
he has nothing to worry about. Right?

08:23.275 --> 08:24.572
Right.

08:25.478 --> 08:26.911
You're right.

08:27.246 --> 08:30.113
I'm worrying about nothing.
I better get going.

08:30.182 --> 08:34.914
Trains take forever to come after 9:00.
Thank you for the Italian burgers.

08:34.986 --> 08:36.044
- All right, bye.
- You're welcome.

08:36.121 --> 08:37.953
- Let us know what happens.
- Okay.

08:38.791 --> 08:42.009
- Hi! Sorry I missed supper.
- I'm sure you were busy.

08:42.044 --> 08:45.228
Hey, listen, we need to talk
about me and Coach. Okay?

08:45.297 --> 08:48.198
You're the only one who knows,
and I know you're still mad at me...

08:48.267 --> 08:51.998
Hilda, I'm not mad.
I was just surprised yesterday.

08:52.071 --> 08:54.869
I never thought you were the type
of person who'd do something like this.

08:54.940 --> 08:59.809
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I'm the same person. I'm your sister.

08:59.945 --> 09:01.242
Have a little faith.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.216
Tony's marriage isn't working, okay?
He wants to be with me.

09:05.251 --> 09:08.709
But getting out of a situation like that
is a little bit complicated.

09:08.787 --> 09:10.311
So that's why we were wondering

09:10.389 --> 09:13.950
if maybe we could just
borrow your apartment?

09:14.059 --> 09:16.220
What? Are you crazy? No!

09:16.328 --> 09:20.697
Hilda, I'm not going to let you turn my
apartment into some sort of sex den!

09:20.766 --> 09:23.428
It's not about sex! It's about love.

09:23.502 --> 09:25.732
Fine. Then some sort of love den.

09:25.804 --> 09:28.272
If it was just about that,
then we could do it in his car.

09:28.340 --> 09:29.898
But that is no place to talk about

09:29.975 --> 09:33.001
whether or not
we have a future together.

09:33.078 --> 09:35.842
Betty, I'm trying to figure this thing out
with him, you know?

09:35.915 --> 09:40.545
And all we need is a place to talk.
Just talk. I promise.

09:49.595 --> 09:51.563
<i>I love you. Thank you, mami.</i>

10:03.943 --> 10:07.879
Well, before you talk to Daniel,
could you at least handcuff me?

10:12.785 --> 10:14.776
Daniel! I have to tell you something!

10:14.853 --> 10:17.151
I meant to tell you yesterday,
but I thought I should do it in person.

10:17.223 --> 10:18.588
You see, I sort of maybe
admitted to the police

10:18.657 --> 10:20.887
that you asked me to lie about where
you were the night of the party.

10:20.993 --> 10:23.052
- Wait, why would you do that?
- I don't know!

10:23.162 --> 10:24.652
I am not a very good liar

10:24.763 --> 10:27.288
and I didn't think it was
that big of a deal and then he...

10:27.399 --> 10:28.957
Mr. Meade? You got a minute?

10:29.068 --> 10:31.502
I was wondering about something
I noticed in your office.

10:31.570 --> 10:33.197
Are these your sneakers?

10:33.272 --> 10:38.005
Yeah, those are actually...
They're Bapes. They're one-of-a-kind.

10:38.077 --> 10:40.978
Nigo hand-molded the soles
for me and everything.

10:41.046 --> 10:43.037
Fancy. Size 11, huh?

10:44.183 --> 10:45.207
I'm afraid you're under arrest.

10:45.284 --> 10:46.478
- What?
- Wait. What?

10:46.552 --> 10:48.918
The tread marks here
match the size 11 shoe prints

10:48.988 --> 10:52.253
we found in the stairwell
where Miss McKinney was pushed.

10:52.324 --> 10:54.383
Betty, call my lawyer.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.425
Um...

10:56.528 --> 10:58.826
Right, okay, I will!

11:21.920 --> 11:25.117
$200,000 bail.
That almost seems cheap.

11:25.190 --> 11:26.714
Here comes the press.
Come on, guys.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.692
Has anyone talked to Daniel Jr?

11:28.794 --> 11:30.921
I mean, I don't want him
to see his father like this.

11:31.030 --> 11:34.488
I've already handled it.
I told him it's a Meade thing.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.161
See, Grandma was in jail before,
and Aunt Alexis may be in jail next!

11:38.237 --> 11:39.898
Seriously, Mom.
We have to come up with a plan.

11:39.972 --> 11:42.873
I think somebody's framing Daniel,
and I wouldn't put it past Wilhelmina.

11:42.941 --> 11:44.568
- Let's go!
Thank you, Betty.

11:44.643 --> 11:46.577
We have nothing to say
at this time, thank you.

11:46.645 --> 11:47.771
Thank you.

12:03.562 --> 12:05.189
What the...

12:14.740 --> 12:16.537
- You're horrible.
- Why?

12:16.608 --> 12:20.044
Because I care about the welfare
of my unborn child?

12:20.112 --> 12:21.238
Wilhelmina!

12:21.313 --> 12:25.750
That's right, I care about
the welfare of my poor, unborn child!

12:26.985 --> 12:32.617
Because you're using me and the baby
as some kind of prop for a PR stunt.

12:32.691 --> 12:35.557
This pregnancy has
just made you hysterical.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.424
Believe me, I understand.
It's the hormones.

12:38.529 --> 12:42.021
You just need a drink of water. Nurse!

12:42.900 --> 12:45.664
Nurse, my surrogate
needs some water!

12:46.637 --> 12:52.371
She's suffered so much already!
Please, won't anyone help me?

12:52.443 --> 12:54.968
Can someone just give
her some water?

12:55.046 --> 12:56.536
All right!

13:11.028 --> 13:14.896
Daniel, look, I know this is my fault,

13:14.966 --> 13:17.434
and I really want
to help you get out of it,

13:17.502 --> 13:20.869
but you did tell me to lie
about where you were last night.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.963
I know. It's complicated.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.940
More complicated
than attempted murder?

13:25.009 --> 13:29.469
Look, you just gotta believe me, Betty.
You know me. I didn't push Christina.

13:29.547 --> 13:38.834
But beyond that,
the less I say, the better.

13:38.869 --> 13:48.121
I promised Betty
we'd keep it clean in here.

13:48.232 --> 13:50.700
That's too bad. I'm feeling dirty.

13:50.768 --> 13:53.566
Coach, what did I just say?

13:54.439 --> 13:57.203
Seriously, I'm dirty.
Water's out at work.

13:57.275 --> 13:59.766
Thank you very much,
New York City public school system.

14:00.978 --> 14:03.242
Yeah, I kind of need a shower.

14:03.347 --> 14:06.510
Okay, well, now I miss the sexy talk.

14:09.287 --> 14:11.084
Do you want to just
take a shower here?

14:12.690 --> 14:16.353
I'll go get some ice cream. And then
when I come back, we can talk.

14:16.461 --> 14:17.723
Talk.

14:17.829 --> 14:19.797
When I say "talk," I actually mean talk.

14:19.897 --> 14:22.229
Yeah, no, no,
I know exactly what you mean.

14:24.669 --> 14:26.899
- I'll be back.
- All right.

14:48.092 --> 14:49.923
All clean, sexy mama...

14:50.027 --> 14:52.825
Whoa! Coach?

14:52.897 --> 14:55.661
<i>- Papi? Tony!
- Hilda!</i>

14:55.733 --> 14:57.098
<i>Papi, what are you doing here?</i>

14:57.168 --> 14:59.227
I was worried about Betty.
I came to install locks.

14:59.303 --> 15:01.771
What'd you get? Schlage locks?

15:01.839 --> 15:04.808
- No, Kwikset.
- Yeah, those are good.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.278
You're married?

15:17.355 --> 15:20.085
<i>Papi... Papi, it's not what you think.</i>

15:22.760 --> 15:24.557
I think I should go.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.966
I don't know why
Daniel won't tell me where he was,

15:32.036 --> 15:36.200
but I just don't think that he's capable
of doing something like this.

15:36.274 --> 15:38.970
I mean, it's my fault
he's in this situation.

15:39.043 --> 15:42.171
I have to prove that he's innocent.
And you can help me.

15:42.246 --> 15:45.647
Well, what can I do?
I mean, I've already talked to the police.

15:45.716 --> 15:49.311
I know, but maybe
there's something that you forgot,

15:49.387 --> 15:51.981
or something that
you didn't fully explain,

15:52.056 --> 15:55.287
that could help us find
who really pushed you.

15:55.393 --> 15:59.523
I never got around to telling you
what happened with Stuart.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.627
What happened with Stuart?

16:05.603 --> 16:11.166
I saw him on the day of the party,
and we fought.

16:11.576 --> 16:14.443
You used me! You just
wanted the money to buy drugs!

16:14.512 --> 16:16.878
- Just listen to me.
- Just get your hands off me!

16:16.948 --> 16:20.076
I am this close to calling immigration
and having you deported.

16:22.086 --> 16:24.850
Oh, my God, Christina!

16:24.922 --> 16:27.720
Everyone's so fixated on
who wants revenge on Wilhelmina,

16:27.825 --> 16:30.419
nobody's talking about who hates you!

16:31.195 --> 16:35.131
I'm sorry, that came out wrong.
What did the police say about Stuart?

16:35.232 --> 16:37.359
I haven't exactly told them about it.

16:39.036 --> 16:42.563
God, Betty, this has just been so awful.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.906
I mean, do you think that Stuart
could really have done this to me?

16:48.679 --> 16:54.117
I don't know. But you can't keep
something like this from the police.

16:54.185 --> 16:56.278
Christina, you have
to tell them the truth.

16:56.354 --> 16:57.651
I know.

17:11.969 --> 17:12.992
Stuart!

17:21.345 --> 17:24.508
Stuart! Hi. What are you doing here?

17:24.582 --> 17:25.844
Well, I heard
Christina was in the hospital.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.008
I had to come see that she's okay.

17:27.084 --> 17:31.714
Yeah, it's just that they don't
really want anyone in there

17:31.789 --> 17:33.757
who might upset her.

17:34.659 --> 17:37.093
- She told you about the fight, huh?
- No.

17:37.161 --> 17:39.629
Maybe. What size shoes do you wear?

17:39.730 --> 17:41.493
- Why?
- No reason.

17:42.299 --> 17:45.359
Size 14. The kids at school used
to call me Bigfoot. It was humiliating.

17:45.436 --> 17:47.301
Now, do you want to tell me
why you need to know that?

17:47.371 --> 17:51.740
Well, the person who pushed Christina
down the stairs wore a size 11.

17:53.077 --> 17:55.068
Do you think I did it?

17:57.448 --> 17:59.541
It breaks my heart that
you think I'm even capable

17:59.650 --> 18:01.982
of hurting Christina. I love her.

18:02.019 --> 18:04.044
Well, what do you expect, Stuart?

18:04.088 --> 18:07.455
She gave up a lot for you
to save your life.

18:07.525 --> 18:08.753
And now you're doing drugs again?

18:08.859 --> 18:10.451
I'm in pain!

18:12.496 --> 18:16.057
The treatment that Christina paid for,
it didn't work.

18:16.934 --> 18:20.370
There's no cure.
So, I'm going to die. Okay?

18:22.640 --> 18:23.868
Oh.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.840
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

18:28.446 --> 18:30.311
Are you going to tell her?

18:30.381 --> 18:32.872
After what Christina's done for me,
to tell her it was all for nothing,

18:32.950 --> 18:34.008
how am I gonna do that?

18:34.085 --> 18:38.385
After all she's done for you,
she deserves to know.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.684
This didn't work in high school.
Why would it work now?

19:08.753 --> 19:10.380
What, are you stalking me?

19:10.454 --> 19:14.015
A married man? Hilda, I thought
you were better than this.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.854
Said the guy who had
an affair with our mom.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.086
That was totally different.

19:17.194 --> 19:18.661
Right, because you're a guy,

19:18.729 --> 19:20.560
and you've got that whole
Latino macho thing happening.

19:20.631 --> 19:22.098
Don't make this about that.
This is about you!

19:22.166 --> 19:23.895
You never say anything like this
to Betty!

19:23.968 --> 19:25.959
Maybe because Betty
wouldn't do something like this.

19:37.348 --> 19:40.715
Good afternoon. Hi, I'm Betty Suarez,
I'm Daniel Meade's assistant.

19:40.785 --> 19:42.844
I need the security tapes
from two nights ago.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.683
You want the security tapes, too?

19:44.755 --> 19:48.885
Like I said, I work for Daniel Meade,
as in, Meade Publications.

19:48.993 --> 19:51.154
The guy they arrested
for pushing that pregnant lady?

19:51.262 --> 19:53.526
- That's the one.
- That's crazy.

19:53.597 --> 19:56.191
- You work for a murderer.
- Attempted murderer.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.269
And he didn't do it.
And you work for him, too.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.496
Wow!

20:00.838 --> 20:04.774
I work for a murderer.
I hadn't considered that.

20:04.842 --> 20:09.506
Right, so if you give me the tapes,
and we can prove he's innocent,

20:09.580 --> 20:12.708
then we won't work for a murderer.

20:12.783 --> 20:13.909
I can't do it.

20:13.984 --> 20:16.748
The morning after your boss
tried to kill that poor pregnant lady,

20:16.821 --> 20:17.913
the tapes were gone.

20:17.988 --> 20:20.684
What?
Well, do you know who took them?

20:23.661 --> 20:26.858
I'll tell you what I told the police
and that little blonde girl.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.023
- Okay.
- I have no idea.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.294
Wait, what little blonde girl?

20:31.368 --> 20:33.700
So I asked about the tapes, so what?

20:33.771 --> 20:36.035
I am not splitting
Wilhelmina's reward money with you.

20:36.106 --> 20:38.165
Amanda, I don't care about the reward.

20:38.242 --> 20:41.439
I just need to help Daniel.
Look, you know he's innocent, too.

20:41.512 --> 20:45.278
I do. Look, don't judge me. Okay?

20:45.349 --> 20:48.785
Not that you ever really could, in that.

20:48.853 --> 20:51.321
But I really, really
need that reward money.

20:51.388 --> 20:53.185
I'm having a little bit
of a cash flow problem.

20:53.257 --> 20:57.022
And I may or may not have maxed out
a few credit cards.

20:57.126 --> 20:59.060
- How many?
- Like, 15.

20:59.128 --> 21:00.459
- Fifteen?
- Shh!

21:00.597 --> 21:03.031
I like nice things, okay, so what?

21:03.066 --> 21:05.000
Anyway, I'm not talking
to my parents now,

21:05.034 --> 21:07.798
so I'm kind of on my own with this.
Not that you'd care.

21:07.871 --> 21:09.736
No, of course I care.

21:09.806 --> 21:12.934
Look, Amanda, you were there
the night Christina got pushed,

21:13.009 --> 21:14.943
so why don't you just tell me
what you remember?

21:15.011 --> 21:17.138
Well, it was late.

21:17.847 --> 21:21.283
That's when I usually try the credit card
companies' Indian call centers.

21:21.351 --> 21:22.477
They're so much nicer.

21:22.919 --> 21:24.477
Seriously, I don't know why

21:24.554 --> 21:27.216
you're making such a big deal
out of this, Rahul.

21:27.290 --> 21:30.316
Is it a crime to purchase things
you can't pay for? No.

21:30.426 --> 21:32.951
Amanda, have you seen the mustard?

21:33.062 --> 21:34.552
I need it for my big, fat sandwich,

21:34.664 --> 21:36.325
which I'm always,
like, eating around you

21:36.399 --> 21:38.128
and making a total mess of myself.

21:38.201 --> 21:40.362
I know. You always are, right?

21:41.638 --> 21:44.402
I do not always eat sandwiches,
and I wasn't even there.

21:44.474 --> 21:48.308
I'm just saying,
it really does feel that way sometimes.

21:48.378 --> 21:50.107
So, anyway, I was back at my desk...

21:50.446 --> 21:53.779
Okay, if I pay my bill,
then I can't pay my rent.

21:53.850 --> 21:56.819
And if I can't pay my rent,
then where will you send my bill?

21:56.886 --> 21:59.218
See, this is actually all for you.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.149
- Christina?
- I peered around the corner.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.591
But it wasn't a woman.

22:05.995 --> 22:09.431
<i>- Well, it was Marc.
- You will rue the day,</i>

22:09.532 --> 22:12.831
Wilhelmina Slater, that you decided
to cross Marc St. James!

22:12.902 --> 22:15.769
I know all of your plans,
and I will make you pay!

22:17.106 --> 22:19.836
Actually, I did push Christina
the other night.

22:19.909 --> 22:21.672
- What?
- It's not what you think.

22:21.744 --> 22:24.838
God, you people jump to conclusions.
And you...

22:24.914 --> 22:26.472
I'd think someone with your skin tone

22:26.549 --> 22:28.813
would be a little more sensitive
to prejudice.

22:28.885 --> 22:32.150
Marc, don't change the subject.
You just said you pushed Christina.

22:32.221 --> 22:36.089
And Amanda said she saw you yelling
at Wilhelmina that night.

22:36.526 --> 22:38.551
Oh, that.

22:39.929 --> 22:42.329
- Well, that really wasn't anything.
- Then why are you hiding it?

22:42.398 --> 22:44.491
I'm not hiding it, I just don't want
anyone to know about it.

22:44.567 --> 22:46.592
- Marc, that's the same thing.
- Fine!

22:46.669 --> 22:49.297
You want to know what I was doing?
I'll show you.

22:52.275 --> 22:54.971
You killed Wilhelmina
and you stuffed her!

22:55.044 --> 22:58.480
- And you put her in Tahari?
- Amanda, it's a Wilhelmina doll.

22:58.548 --> 23:01.381
It's a Wilhelmina mannequin.
She had it made for dress fittings.

23:01.451 --> 23:04.648
Now, I'm not proud of this,
and I will deny it if asked,

23:04.721 --> 23:07.588
but sometimes when I'm angry at her,

23:07.657 --> 23:11.957
I will pull out the mannequin
late at night and yell at it.

23:12.628 --> 23:14.596
You will rue the day,

23:14.697 --> 23:18.963
Wilhelmina Slater, that you decided
to cross Marc St. James!

23:19.035 --> 23:23.938
I know all of your plans,
and I will make you pay!

23:28.745 --> 23:31.839
You slapped her? Hardcore.

23:31.948 --> 23:33.575
Well, I apologized afterwards.

23:33.649 --> 23:37.642
I mean, I know she's not real,
but she still scares me a little.

23:37.787 --> 23:39.880
Marc, you still haven't explained

23:39.956 --> 23:42.254
exactly why you were angry
at Wilhelmina.

23:42.358 --> 23:45.191
I don't know. Maybe because
I've been loyal to her for years,

23:45.261 --> 23:49.220
and then in a matter of days
she hires this little Mayan fireplug

23:49.332 --> 23:51.459
and promotes her above me?

23:51.834 --> 23:53.165
Marc, that again?

23:53.236 --> 23:55.568
You may think that I lick Willie's
boots because I like it,

23:55.638 --> 23:57.037
and I do, a little, they're fancy,

23:57.106 --> 24:00.507
but there is a reason
why I put myself through it.

24:00.643 --> 24:04.636
You're not the only one who wants
to get ahead in the magazine world.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.375
I have dreams, too.

24:07.183 --> 24:08.207
Wow.

24:08.284 --> 24:09.581
You've never mentioned that.

24:09.652 --> 24:13.247
Anyway, I was a little worked up,
yelling at the Wilhel-mannequin,

24:13.322 --> 24:14.789
so I just wanted to go home.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.926
<i>But Christina was blocking my way.</i>

24:18.895 --> 24:21.625
- Excuse me.
You!

24:21.964 --> 24:25.832
You're carrying that thing for her!

24:27.370 --> 24:30.862
So that's the last time I saw Christina.
With Claire.

24:32.341 --> 24:35.242
Who seemed pretty pissed off at her,
now that I think about it.

24:35.311 --> 24:38.075
Oh, my God. Claire.

24:38.915 --> 24:41.440
She had a motive. An opportunity.

24:41.517 --> 24:45.283
Not to mention
she totally murdered my mom.

24:47.523 --> 24:48.785
Kind of.

25:01.938 --> 25:05.101
All right, Mrs. Meade, if you
could just tell us what you remember.

25:05.174 --> 25:06.869
Just so you know, if I had done it,

25:06.943 --> 25:09.173
I would never let my son
take the blame.

25:09.245 --> 25:10.678
Something you learned in prison?

25:10.746 --> 25:12.680
There's two things they always tell you,

25:12.748 --> 25:16.084
do your own time,
and don't trust the po-po.

25:16.119 --> 25:20.522
Okay, so what exactly were you doing
the night of the launch party?

25:20.590 --> 25:23.650
Well, you probably remember us
at the party,

25:23.759 --> 25:25.852
exchanging our usual pleasantries.

25:26.295 --> 25:27.557
You can't push me aside.

25:27.630 --> 25:31.589
Don't you ever threaten
my children, Wilhelmina.

25:31.701 --> 25:35.535
You have no idea the lengths
I will go to protect them.

25:38.007 --> 25:41.408
You're not doing a very good job
of explaining how you're innocent.

25:41.477 --> 25:44.674
Yes, well, Wilhelmina has a way
of getting me worked up.

25:45.081 --> 25:50.451
<i>And that night I found myself needing
a little something to take the edge off.</i>

25:50.520 --> 25:54.422
All right, you slipped up.
You had a drink. So what?

25:54.590 --> 25:58.356
That's the thing.
I can't have just one drink.

25:59.695 --> 26:00.992
I screwed up, Betty.

26:01.430 --> 26:06.367
Wilhelmina Slater,
more like Wilhelmina Slut-er. Get it?

26:10.306 --> 26:12.365
That's okay. I'm so funny.

26:20.550 --> 26:25.317
- Excuse me.
- You!

26:26.055 --> 26:30.515
You're carrying that thing for her!

26:34.030 --> 26:35.998
You're bringing me here
because I got a little wet.

26:36.065 --> 26:37.589
- Yeah.
- Mom.

26:41.170 --> 26:44.139
- Mother, have you been drinking?
- Maybe.

26:44.674 --> 26:47.768
Well, the last one sort of ended up
all over me, really.

26:48.244 --> 26:50.144
- Thank you, Christina.
- Yep.

26:51.314 --> 26:52.440
Thank you.

26:52.515 --> 26:55.746
My mother has struggled with
this one for a long time.

26:55.818 --> 26:57.752
But I can't really blame her.

26:57.820 --> 26:59.981
It's been a stressful week for all of us.

27:00.122 --> 27:04.252
I was sort of dealing with
my own problems that night.

27:04.293 --> 27:05.851
You mean Wilhelmina?

27:05.962 --> 27:07.930
- Yeah, Wilhelmina?
- Yeah.

27:11.100 --> 27:14.365
Let me remind you
of my position at this company

27:14.437 --> 27:16.769
and then all of yours

27:16.839 --> 27:22.744
before I say this doesn't go
any further than this room.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.310
- Okay, right.
- That's great.

27:27.583 --> 27:29.073
We understand.

27:29.752 --> 27:31.777
I work very hard to look poised.

27:33.122 --> 27:37.422
<i>But sometimes,
things slip through the cracks.</i>

27:38.060 --> 27:40.221
<i>Oh, my God,
what did you find?</i>

27:41.097 --> 27:42.155
<i>Facial hair.</i>

27:42.265 --> 27:43.323
- Facial hair?
- Facial hair?

27:43.432 --> 27:46.162
I'd forgotten to take my estrogen.

27:46.869 --> 27:50.270
I go to great lengths to maintain
the illusion that I was born a woman.

27:50.339 --> 27:51.533
But I wasn't.

27:52.541 --> 27:54.805
You know,
I think if I had fresh lipstick.

27:54.910 --> 27:56.138
Yeah, I...

27:56.212 --> 27:59.375
<i>I'll be honest.
I didn't even notice Christina leaving.</i>

27:59.448 --> 28:03.077
<i>I guess she must have snuck out
while I was helping my mom.</i>

28:03.185 --> 28:05.619
The rest of the night was spent
trying to hail a taxi,

28:05.688 --> 28:08.521
and keep my mom from getting sick
on my brand new Donna Karan.

28:12.628 --> 28:15.927
Wow! I never knew
Alexis went through that.

28:15.998 --> 28:19.900
Or Claire. Or you, Amanda,
with your credit cards.

28:19.969 --> 28:22.403
I mean, you'd think there was an easy
explanation for these things,

28:22.471 --> 28:23.460
but there just isn't.

28:23.539 --> 28:27.737
I know, but after talking to everyone,
it really does seem like Daniel did it.

28:28.244 --> 28:29.939
And I'm genuinely surprised.

28:30.012 --> 28:33.072
No! Daniel is innocent. I know he is.

28:34.684 --> 28:37.346
Maybe Wilhelmina
could help us prove it.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.615
- Prove what?
- Prove that Daniel's innocent.

28:39.689 --> 28:42.021
I didn't understand that part.

28:42.758 --> 28:45.784
Christina was standing right here,
so, okay, guys, go ahead.

28:45.895 --> 28:48.261
Throw the mannequin down the stairs.

28:55.438 --> 28:56.530
I don't want to be critical here,

28:56.605 --> 28:59.403
but we can't re-enact this crime with
that mannequin. It's way too skinny.

28:59.475 --> 29:01.375
So true. We need something heavy,

29:01.444 --> 29:04.379
that can double as
a convincing pregnant woman.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.276
Guys, don't be ridiculous.

29:07.350 --> 29:08.817
I'm not gonna let you
throw me down the stairs.

29:08.884 --> 29:10.579
Just relax, you won't break anything
unless you tense up!

29:10.653 --> 29:12.644
Marc, I said let me go!

29:25.767 --> 29:29.726
Are you guys crazy?
You could have killed us!

29:34.743 --> 29:37.143
Great. Can you have my raincoat
dry-cleaned while you're at it?

29:38.480 --> 29:39.947
Hello, Dusty!

29:40.782 --> 29:43.046
Oh, my God, Daniel's coat.

29:50.458 --> 29:54.986
Dear, I was talking to Barbara Walters'
people about setting up an...

29:55.196 --> 29:59.098
Everything all right? Emotional stress
is not good for the baby.

29:59.167 --> 30:01.135
Stuart came to see me.

30:02.404 --> 30:04.497
His treatment didn't work.

30:07.008 --> 30:08.600
And he's dying.

30:10.879 --> 30:16.215
Well, I suppose that's the danger
of experimental treatments.

30:18.086 --> 30:21.954
Can you just leave me on my own
for a little while? Please?

30:42.677 --> 30:44.167
What did I do?

30:58.927 --> 31:00.417
Daniel! Hi.

31:00.595 --> 31:03.086
I was just looking for some paperwork.
Nope, it's not here.

31:03.131 --> 31:07.124
Hey, I'm glad I found you.
Look, I've just been wanting

31:07.202 --> 31:11.002
to tell you how much your faith in me
has meant during this whole ordeal.

31:11.072 --> 31:12.767
Yeah, of course.

31:15.310 --> 31:18.108
- Is something wrong?
- No. Nothing's wrong.

31:18.413 --> 31:20.381
- Why would anything be wrong?
- I don't know.

31:20.448 --> 31:22.643
Just kind of the way you said,
"nothing's wrong,"

31:22.717 --> 31:26.744
kind of, like, you know,
sounds like there is something wrong.

31:26.821 --> 31:27.947
No.

31:29.824 --> 31:31.121
I got to go.

31:41.102 --> 31:43.798
Betty? Thank God you're here.

31:44.239 --> 31:47.675
I don't know what to do.
Hilda's having an affair.

31:47.742 --> 31:49.539
- Coach Diaz? He's married!
- I know.

31:49.611 --> 31:51.545
Wait, what? You know?

31:54.082 --> 31:57.916
Dad! Enough with the Spanish.
I think Daniel pushed Christina!

31:57.986 --> 31:59.214
What?

32:01.556 --> 32:02.955
I found this in his bag.

32:03.057 --> 32:06.288
<i>It's a security tape from Mode,
the night Christina got pushed.</i>

32:06.394 --> 32:07.827
He stole it.

32:08.730 --> 32:10.425
Do you think he's guilty?

32:10.498 --> 32:13.296
I don't know. I don't know what to think!

32:13.368 --> 32:16.030
I mean, I spent the entire day
trying to prove that he's innocent,

32:16.104 --> 32:19.369
and all I found out was that everything
is more complicated than I thought.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.169
Betty, this is why I worry about you.

32:21.242 --> 32:24.905
I know, Dad, I know.
You think I'm naive, I'm too trusting.

32:24.979 --> 32:28.210
Is it really naive
to want to believe in people?

32:29.183 --> 32:32.744
I mean, look at Hilda.
Okay, so she made a mistake.

32:33.588 --> 32:35.647
She's still a good person.

32:36.624 --> 32:40.685
And I would say the same thing
about Daniel, right before I found this.

32:41.329 --> 32:45.197
<i>That's not being naive, mi hija.
That's faith.</i>

32:50.438 --> 32:52.133
Have you seen it?

32:54.142 --> 32:55.234
No.

32:57.111 --> 33:00.205
I don't want to know
if I'm wrong about Daniel.

33:00.648 --> 33:02.479
What if you're right?

33:25.073 --> 33:29.373
Daniel. This is dirty and awkward.

33:30.678 --> 33:33.442
But why would he want to hide that
from the police?

33:37.018 --> 33:39.885
- It's complicated.
- It's not that complicated, Daniel.

33:39.954 --> 33:42.081
- I've seen the tape.
- Oh, God, not the...

33:42.156 --> 33:44.283
Yes! And I saw it with my dad!

33:44.392 --> 33:48.488
Okay, so the woman
I was with that night,

33:48.596 --> 33:50.621
that was Holly,
the State Department liaison

33:50.732 --> 33:52.563
who's been helping me
with my custody problems.

33:52.634 --> 33:54.124
- And you're sleeping with her?
- No, no.

33:54.202 --> 33:56.500
That happened
after she started helping me.

33:56.571 --> 34:00.132
It wasn't like she started helping me
because we slept together.

34:00.274 --> 34:04.074
But if it ever got out,
I know that's what it would look like.

34:04.846 --> 34:08.282
That's it?
That's why you couldn't say anything?

34:08.349 --> 34:09.976
What, are you crazy?

34:10.051 --> 34:12.985
Daniel, you were arrested
for attempted murder!

34:13.054 --> 34:14.748
Yeah, which I didn't commit!

34:14.822 --> 34:17.757
Look, I had to believe they were
gonna find the real culprit eventually.

34:17.824 --> 34:20.350
Besides, if they ever found out
where I really was that night,

34:20.460 --> 34:22.929
Holly could've lost her job,
I'd lose her help,

34:22.996 --> 34:24.828
and I could lose Daniel Jr. forever!

34:24.899 --> 34:28.494
He's my son, Betty.
I'm not gonna lose him now. I won't.

34:30.438 --> 34:33.737
Oh, my God. Daniel.

34:33.808 --> 34:37.904
I've never been more happy to find out
about one of your sleazy affairs!

34:39.213 --> 34:40.771
I knew you couldn't have
pushed Christina.

34:40.848 --> 34:43.408
I believed in you, and I was right!

34:43.484 --> 34:45.452
Thank you, Betty.

34:46.554 --> 34:50.320
I'm sorry to do this right now,
but I'm late to pick up DJ.

34:50.757 --> 34:53.693
Right. Okay. Yes, you should go.

34:56.931 --> 34:59.900
Would you mind giving
that coat back to Alexis?

35:00.034 --> 35:02.696
- What do you mean, "give it back"?
- She borrowed it a couple days ago.

35:02.737 --> 35:05.035
It looks better on her, anyway.

35:18.019 --> 35:20.954
Alexis, I know you did it.

35:26.694 --> 35:29.663
I don't know
what you're talking about, Betty.

35:29.731 --> 35:31.528
Daniel's coat, you borrowed it.

35:31.599 --> 35:35.228
It had dust from the bottom of the steps
where Christina fell.

35:35.670 --> 35:39.572
So I got his coat dusty, so what?
That doesn't mean anything.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.631
- What about your feet?
- Excuse me?

35:41.709 --> 35:43.540
There are a lot of things
you can change about yourself,

35:43.611 --> 35:45.135
but your shoe size isn't one of them.

35:45.213 --> 35:47.579
Men's size 11. Just like Daniel's.

35:47.648 --> 35:50.981
Same as the ones the police found
at the bottom of the stairs.

35:51.052 --> 35:53.282
You pushed Christina, Alexis.

35:55.389 --> 35:56.856
What do you want?

36:00.928 --> 36:03.226
What you did to Christina was horrible.

36:03.264 --> 36:06.927
But then you stole Daniel's shoes,
and you wore his coat.

36:06.968 --> 36:09.368
You framed your own brother, Alexis!

36:09.437 --> 36:11.735
I didn't mean for that to happen,
I swear.

36:11.806 --> 36:14.434
Yeah, well, that's what it looks like.

36:20.414 --> 36:23.383
The night of the party,
things were bad with Wilhelmina.

36:24.152 --> 36:25.779
I know we've had our differences,
Wilhelmina,

36:25.853 --> 36:28.344
but we're going to have to find
a way to work together.

36:28.422 --> 36:31.687
Spare me, Alexis.
You stabbed me in the back.

36:31.793 --> 36:35.627
So let me give you fair warning,
my freakishly tall girlfriend.

36:35.696 --> 36:38.961
You will never be rid of me,
thanks to this baby.

36:39.033 --> 36:40.625
I know all of your secrets.

36:40.701 --> 36:44.102
And when I get my chance,
you'll never see it coming.

36:49.443 --> 36:52.310
<i>I was so pissed off at her,
I broke a heel.</i>

36:53.481 --> 36:56.075
<i>Brand new Sergio Rossi's, too!</i>

36:56.150 --> 36:57.447
<i>I knew he was my size,</i>

36:57.518 --> 37:01.545
<i>so I went to see if Daniel might
have a pair of shoes that fit me.</i>

37:02.557 --> 37:05.583
<i>Then I saw the facial hair.
And right after that...</i>

37:08.930 --> 37:11.398
<i>I know it's not right,
but at that moment,</i>

37:11.499 --> 37:14.900
<i>I didn't see Christina.
I saw someone else.</i>

37:16.337 --> 37:18.305
You'll never be rid of me.

37:18.372 --> 37:19.862
<i>She was right.</i>

37:19.941 --> 37:21.932
<i>As long as Christina
was carrying her baby,</i>

37:22.009 --> 37:24.500
<i>I would never be rid of her.</i>

37:24.579 --> 37:26.479
<i>My mother passed out.</i>

37:28.616 --> 37:31.710
<i>So I followed Christina
out into the hallway...</i>

37:34.522 --> 37:36.513
<i>And I can't explain it.</i>

37:45.265 --> 37:47.529
<i>But when I saw Christina then,</i>

37:48.668 --> 37:50.295
<i>all I could think of was Wilhelmina</i>

37:50.370 --> 37:53.339
<i>and everything
she's put our family through.</i>

37:54.674 --> 37:57.108
<i>I didn't think. I just...</i>

38:17.230 --> 38:19.198
<i>I ran to her afterward,</i>

38:23.970 --> 38:26.234
<i>made sure she was still alive,</i>

38:29.209 --> 38:30.938
<i>and called 911.</i>

38:33.513 --> 38:35.913
<i>I can't justify what I did.</i>

38:38.218 --> 38:41.153
And Daniel,
I never, ever wanted that to happen.

38:41.221 --> 38:44.088
It was insane. I just kept telling myself,

38:44.190 --> 38:48.456
"He's innocent. It'll go away. "
Oh, God, Betty.

38:50.630 --> 38:53.098
If I could take it back, I would.

38:54.401 --> 38:58.337
But I can't. What do I do?

39:03.343 --> 39:06.870
Well, no one else knows yet.

39:08.415 --> 39:12.818
And I haven't told Daniel because
I know you're a good person, Alexis.

39:13.086 --> 39:16.715
But right now, you're the only person
who can prove that.

39:21.194 --> 39:24.129
<i>Oh, but if you do</i>

39:24.464 --> 39:27.194
<i>It all comes back</i>

39:28.401 --> 39:31.199
<i>Just breathe</i>

39:33.373 --> 39:35.500
<i>Breathe</i>

39:36.943 --> 39:39.844
<i>Just breathe</i>

39:41.982 --> 39:43.609
<i>Breathe</i>

39:46.186 --> 39:50.623
<i>We tend to forget
we're all the same</i>

39:54.761 --> 39:58.697
<i>We all have joy, we all have pain</i>

40:02.268 --> 40:06.432
<i>Oh, but if we won't remember</i>

40:11.111 --> 40:15.946
<i>How beautiful it would be</i>

40:19.319 --> 40:22.720
<i>If we breathe</i>

40:24.891 --> 40:26.859
<i>Breathe</i>

40:27.927 --> 40:30.395
<i>Believe</i>

40:33.266 --> 40:35.496
<i>Believe</i>

40:37.771 --> 40:42.071
<i>We tend to forget we're all the same</i>

40:46.046 --> 40:50.005
<i>We all have joy, we all have pain</i>

40:54.854 --> 40:57.049
<i>Breathe</i>

40:57.157 --> 41:00.991
So, her lawyers are
negotiating the terms of her surrender.

41:02.162 --> 41:05.563
Betty, you'd think you'd know
your own sister by now.

41:05.965 --> 41:09.560
I know. But people can surprise you.

41:10.203 --> 41:11.602
Miss Meade,

41:13.606 --> 41:15.301
if you're ready.

41:16.676 --> 41:17.768
Dear.

41:18.478 --> 41:21.538
Mom, there's one more thing
I have to tell you.

41:21.681 --> 41:23.774
Could you give us
another moment, please?

41:24.150 --> 41:25.276
Thank you.

41:26.052 --> 41:27.485
When I was clearing out my office,

41:27.554 --> 41:30.421
I accidentally opened up a piece
of Daniel's mail.

41:30.523 --> 41:32.991
Darling,
given what we're dealing with here,

41:33.093 --> 41:35.027
I think Daniel's going to
overlook that one.

41:35.095 --> 41:36.687
No, no. He won't.

41:37.730 --> 41:39.698
It was a paternity test.

41:39.799 --> 41:41.664
I don't understand.

41:43.503 --> 41:46.199
Daniel isn't Daniel Jr. 's father.

41:47.574 --> 41:48.734
I am.

41:49.305 --> 41:55.301
