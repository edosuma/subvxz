IF THERE'S ANYTHING

02:03.709 --> 02:06.709
YOU CAN TELL US
ABOUT THE MAN WHO INJURED YOU.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.125
I KNOW WHERE CARLOS AND HIS
BROTHER HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT--

02:09.125 --> 02:10.959
AT A LOCAL CLUB
CALLED THE MAYAN.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.625
- YOU GOT YOUR LEAD.
CONGRATS.

THEY SHOW UP,

02:29.792 --> 02:32.625
- ANGEL, LET HIM GO.
THIS IS A STING!

02:32.625 --> 02:34.166
I.A. NEEDED MY HELP

02:34.166 --> 02:36.250
TO BUST A NARCOTICS COP
ON THE TAKE,

02:36.250 --> 02:38.125
AND I SAID YES,
TO CLOSE THE BOOKS

02:38.125 --> 02:39.792

02:47.417 --> 02:49.834
- YOU GOT A NAME?

02:49.834 --> 02:51.375
- DEXTER MORGAN.

02:51.375 --> 02:55.000
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.458
THERE WERE OTHERS.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.291
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU
ACTUALLY FIND ONE OF THESE GUYS?

02:59.291 --> 03:02.291
- WHAT YOU WON'T.
- YOU GONNA KILL HIM?

03:02.291 --> 03:05.959
- YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

03:05.959 --> 03:07.291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:07.291 --> 03:10.125
- YOU WERE ABOUT TO MURDER
THE WRONG MAN.

03:10.125 --> 03:13.041
GO HOME.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.125
- OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GO.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.208
- THANK YOU.

03:21.208 --> 03:25.041
- MAYBE THIS IS ONE PROBLEM
I CAN CHECK OFF THE LIST.

03:27.709 --> 03:31.500
- WELCOME TO MIAMI.

03:47.542 --> 03:48.667
- I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO KEEP

03:48.667 --> 03:51.333
THE DIFFERENT PARTS
OF MY LIFE SEPARATE.

03:55.709 --> 03:59.542
BECOMING A FATHER MADE THAT
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

03:59.542 --> 04:02.542
AND AS A HUSBAND,
I FAILED.

04:02.542 --> 04:06.208
BUT I'M
A VERY NEAT MONSTER...

04:06.208 --> 04:09.166
WHO WON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.959
- I PACKED UP
RITA'S WEDDING DRESS.

04:15.959 --> 04:18.917
I THOUGHT ASTOR
MIGHT WANT IT SOMEDAY.

04:23.375 --> 04:27.959
FEELS LIKE IT TOOK YOU GUYS
MONTHS TO MOVE IN...

04:27.959 --> 04:29.792
ONLY A DAY TO PACK UP.

04:29.792 --> 04:31.875
- THE REALTOR SUGGESTED
WE PAINT THE WALLS WHITE.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.625
SHE WANTS TO STAGE THE HOUSE
MIAMI CHIC.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.875
- NO EVIDENCE THAT A FAMILY
EVER LIVED HERE.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.291
- OR DIED HERE.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.625
- YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT,
DON'T YOU?

04:40.625 --> 04:43.250
- THE HOPE IS THAT
A RIDICULOUSLY LOW LISTING PRICE

04:43.250 --> 04:46.041
WILL HELP A BUYER
SEE PAST THAT.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.875
- ANY IDEA
WHERE YOU WANT TO LIVE?

04:49.875 --> 04:52.291
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS A STUPID QUESTION.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.959
YOU--YOU SHOULD TAKE
THE APARTMENT.

04:53.959 --> 04:57.208
- NO. NO, THAT'S YOURS.
- NO. I INSIST.

04:57.208 --> 04:58.959
IT'S REALLY
ALWAYS BEEN YOURS.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.917
I'LL MOVE OUT.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.333
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY DID.

05:03.333 --> 05:06.917
- I DIDN'T MOVE IN
WITH QUINN.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.458
- WELL, YOU'RE NEVER AROUND.

05:08.458 --> 05:12.083
- I'M AT QUINN'S,
BUT I DON'T LIVE THERE...

05:12.083 --> 05:14.375
NO CLOTHES IN ANY DRAWERS.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.333
THERE'S NO
HIS-AND-HERS-TOOTHBRUSH ACTION.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.333
QUINN'S PLACE IS ALL QUINN.

05:21.333 --> 05:24.458
- A VAST, EMPTY SPACE?

05:30.125 --> 05:31.709
- I DON'T REMEMBER RITA
IN THESE.

05:31.709 --> 05:34.333
- BECAUSE THEY BELONG
TO LUMEN.

05:34.333 --> 05:38.458
ME EITHER.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.667
LUMEN IS HOME IN MINNEAPOLIS--

05:40.667 --> 05:43.750

PACKED AWAY.

EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE.

06:36.458 --> 06:40.166
SOON, LANCE ROBINSON
WILL BE ON MY TABLE.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.834
LANCE TROLLS THE INTERNET,

06:42.834 --> 06:47.417
ENGAGING IN CASUAL ENCOUNTERS
WITH INNOCENT MEN...

06:47.417 --> 06:49.625
WHO NEVER SUSPECT
THOSE ENCOUNTERS

06:49.625 --> 06:52.083
COULD TURN DEADLY.

06:54.542 --> 06:58.208
FOUR TIMES
LANCE DELIBERATELY PUSHED

06:58.208 --> 07:02.583
SOMEONE'S FANTASIES TOO FAR.

07:02.583 --> 07:06.375
HE WILL BE AN EASY KILL,
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

07:06.375 --> 07:09.417
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

07:34.959 --> 07:36.375
- OKAY, PEOPLE,

07:36.375 --> 07:38.250
LET'S GO OVER OUR POSITIONS
AT CLUB MAYAN.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.208
EVERYBODY BE IN PLACE
BY 10:00.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.083
BATISTA AND I'LL BE
IN THE VAN, AS USUAL.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.458
QUINN,
YOU'LL WATCH THE DOOR.

07:43.458 --> 07:46.000
CIRA--

07:46.000 --> 07:48.125
- YES, CHIEF?

07:48.125 --> 07:50.208
- DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.959
- OFFICER MANZON,
YOU'LL BE ON THE FLOOR

07:51.959 --> 07:53.875
WATCHING FOOT TRAFFIC
AT THE V.I.P. ROOM,

07:53.875 --> 07:56.208
IN CASE THE FUENTES BROTHERS
ROLL THROUGH.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.625
- AND WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

07:57.625 --> 08:00.917
- THEN WE'LL WORK
THE OPERATION UNTIL THEY DO.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.709
- YOU WERE FACE-TO-FACE
WITH CARLOS FUENTES, RIGHT?

08:03.709 --> 08:04.959
- YES, SIR.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.709
- WELL, THEN THAT MEANS
HE KNOWS THAT WE'RE ONTO HIM.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.000
TELL ME WHY THEY WOULD EVER
RETURN TO THIS CLUB.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.375
- THE ONLY REASON
THE FUENTES BROTHERS

08:11.375 --> 08:12.792
ARE FORCING PEOPLE
TO WITHDRAW CASH FROM THE ATM

08:12.792 --> 08:15.625
IS TO PAY FOR TABLE SERVICE
AT THIS CLUB.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.208
- WE RAN THE DATES
OF THE ATM HOLDUPS

08:18.208 --> 08:19.875
PAST THE CLUB MANAGERS.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.291
AND THEY CONFIRMED
THAT IN EACH OF THOSE NIGHTS,

08:22.291 --> 08:24.458
THE FUENTES BROTHERS
SHOWED UP AT CLUB MAYAN

08:24.458 --> 08:26.166
AND TOOK OVER
THE V.I.P. LOUNGE.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.875
- SO IF THE FUENTES BROTHERS
DO SHOW UP AT THIS CLUB,

08:28.875 --> 08:31.083
WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY,
IT MEANS THAT SOMEONE

08:31.083 --> 08:33.041
IS POSSIBLY LYING ON THE FLOOR
OF THEIR LIVING ROOM

08:33.041 --> 08:36.041
WITHOUT THEIR HEAD.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.625
- WE'RE WORKING
THE ONLY LEAD WE HAVE.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.583
- ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS DRINKING AND DANCING

08:39.583 --> 08:42.834
ON THE TAXPAYER'S DIME.

08:42.834 --> 08:45.208
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
MORE FROM YOU, MORGAN.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.000
- CHIEF...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.750
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS HERE.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.000
WITHOUT THIS OPERATION,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.625
WE'RE EFFECTIVELY STOPPING WORK
ON THIS CASE,

09:04.625 --> 09:06.125
WHICH WE CANNOT DO
TO THIS COMMUNITY.

09:06.125 --> 09:08.542
- DID YOU EVEN KNOW
THIS OPERATION WAS HAPPENING?

09:08.542 --> 09:10.291
- OF COURSE I KNEW.
WHY WOULDN'T I?

09:10.291 --> 09:11.834
- WELL, IT SEEMS
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING

09:11.834 --> 09:14.041
AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME LATELY
WITH INTERNAL AFFAIRS

09:14.041 --> 09:16.542
BAILING YOUR NEW HUSBAND
OUT OF HOT WATER.

09:16.542 --> 09:19.542
BRAVO, MRS. BATISTA.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.709
- I'M KEEPING MY NAME.

09:21.709 --> 09:23.041
AND I THINK WORKING CLUB MAYAN

09:23.041 --> 09:25.125
IS A VALID ALLOCATION
OF MY SQUAD'S RESOURCES.

09:25.125 --> 09:27.125
- IT IS YOUR SQUAD,
LIEUTENANT.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.583
HOW YOU MANAGE IT IS UP TO YOU.
- THANK YOU.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.208
- BUT IF ANOTHER MURDER
GOES UP ON THE BOARD,

09:31.208 --> 09:34.166
IT'S YOUR ASS ON THE LINE,
NOT MINE.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.834
- YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT
AT CLUB MAYAN.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.792
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.083
- MATTHEWS DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH FAITH IN US, DOES HE?

09:46.083 --> 09:48.709
- YEAH, WELL, THAT FIGHT YOU HAD
AT THE BAR DIDN'T HELP ANYTHING.

09:48.709 --> 09:51.583
- HE KNOWS ABOUT THE BAR FIGHT?
- OF COURSE HE KNOWS.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.208
A NARCOTICS OFFICER
GOT SUSPENDED

09:53.208 --> 09:54.583
BECAUSE OF THAT BAR FIGHT.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.083
- NO. A NARCOTICS OFFICER
GOT SUSPENDED

09:57.083 --> 09:58.417
BECAUSE OF YOU.

09:58.417 --> 10:00.417
- ME?
- YOU RAN TO I.A.D.

10:00.417 --> 10:02.417
YOU COOKED UP THE STING.

10:02.417 --> 10:04.667
YOU BASICALLY
GOT STAN LIDDY FIRED.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.917
- AND GOT ALL THE CHARGES
AGAINST YOU DROPPED.

10:06.917 --> 10:08.291
- I DIDN'T ASK
FOR ANY OF THAT.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.750
I COULD HAVE HANDLED WHATEVER
I.A.D. HAD COMING MY WAY.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.208
- OH, SO ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENS IS FINE?

10:12.208 --> 10:13.875
- WHEN IT HAPPENS
TO ME, YES.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.375
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.583
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE MARRIED,

10:16.583 --> 10:17.959
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ME
HAPPENS TO YOU.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.667
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.667
WE'RE MARRIED.
- HERE'S WHAT'S BOTHERING ME.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.208
YOU WEREN'T LOOKING OUT
FOR ME

10:23.208 --> 10:24.500
OUT OF SOME SENSE
OF COMPASSION.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.750
YOU WERE TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.750
GOD FORBID YOUR NAME SHOULD LOSE
SOME OF ITS SHINE.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.792
- GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.
- MM-HMM.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.834
- [sighs]

10:57.959 --> 10:59.917
[knocking on door]

10:59.917 --> 11:01.208
- HEY.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.333
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
A DEBRIEFING

11:03.333 --> 11:05.208
BEFORE WE HIT CLUB MAYAN.

11:05.208 --> 11:09.834
- UM, SORT OF
NOT A GOOD TIME.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.291
- WHERE'S QUINN, AND WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE WITH HIM?

11:14.667 --> 11:17.208
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
JUST GIVE ME AN HOUR.

11:17.208 --> 11:20.333
- AN HOUR?
- YEAH.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.875
- WHO'S NAKED
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

11:21.875 --> 11:24.834
- UH, NO ONE IS NAKED.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.250
- THEN WHAT?

11:26.250 --> 11:29.500
I'M SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT.
- DEBRA, WAIT.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.166
COME HERE.
DEBRA, COME HERE.

11:34.709 --> 11:37.458
DEBRA MORGAN.
THIS IS STAN LIDDY.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.500
LIDDY HAD A RUN-IN
WITH I.A.D.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.166
AND, UH, GOT SUSPENDED.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.583
WE'RE PREPPING HIM

11:44.583 --> 11:46.583
FOR HIS UNION-REP MEETING
TOMORROW.

11:46.583 --> 11:47.709
- SORRY.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.750
- ALL CLOTHES ARE STAYING ON.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.375
- I'LL JUST--
- UH, MEET ME THERE?

11:53.375 --> 11:55.667
- YEAH, I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

11:59.458 --> 12:02.333
- YOU ARE BONING
OUR TARGET'S SISTER?

12:02.333 --> 12:06.250
- JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU
FOUND OUT ON DEXTER MORGAN.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.875
- WELL...

12:08.875 --> 12:11.208
YOUR BOY'S SQUEAKY CLEAN
ON PAPER.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.667
HE'S ONLY BEEN OUT
OF THE COUNTRY ONCE, TO PARIS.

12:13.667 --> 12:17.709
PAYS HIS BILLS ON TIME,
KEEPS TO HIMSELF.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.291
I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S ALL TOO NEAT

12:19.291 --> 12:20.875
AND A LITTLE TOO PHONY.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.208
YOU SEE DRUG DEALERS

12:22.208 --> 12:24.750
WITH THE VERY SAME PROFILES
ALL THE TIME.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.125
- OH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M THINKING.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.875
I MEAN, WHAT'S HE HIDING?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.417
- PEEKABOO.

12:31.417 --> 12:36.000
- [laughing]

12:36.000 --> 12:38.875
- BYE-BYE, DADDY.
PEEKABOO!

12:41.000 --> 12:42.667
OH, THANK YOU.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.458
- YOU'RE REALLY VERY GOOD
WITH HIM.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.709
- I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORK TONIGHT.

12:47.709 --> 12:50.208
THE LAB FELL SO FAR BEHIND
WHILE I WAS OUT.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.625
NIGHT'S THE ONLY TIME I CAN EVER
GET ANYTHING DONE.

12:52.625 --> 12:55.875
- WELL, I HOPE THE LIEUTENANT
APPRECIATES YOUR DEDICATION.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.417
- I'M PRETTY SURE SHE DOES.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.375
ALTHOUGH TONIGHT
WILL BE DEDICATED TO LANCE.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.750
- SO YOU THINK
ABOUT MIDNIGHT, THEN?

13:05.750 --> 13:08.542
- I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT SOONER.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.291
- CAN YOU SAY
"BYE-BYE, DADDY"?

13:10.291 --> 13:13.333
- DIE-DIE.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.458
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

HEIGHTENS THE HIGH,

38:47.750 --> 38:50.375
BUT IT'S NOT
WITHOUT ITS RISKS.

38:50.375 --> 38:51.709
[sighs]

38:51.709 --> 38:55.291
EITHER WAY, I WOULDN'T TOUCH
THE NOZZLE OF THAT HOSE.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.875
- ANYTHING TO ADD?

39:00.875 --> 39:04.625
- THE BLOOD IS CONSISTENT
WITH MASUKA'S THEORY.

39:04.625 --> 39:07.834
- IF THERE'S ANY FOLLOW-UP,
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT.

39:07.834 --> 39:08.959
- WE'RE GOOD HERE?

39:08.959 --> 39:11.083
- YOU JUST LANDED.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.083
- I HAVE TO RELIEVE SONYA.

39:13.083 --> 39:15.375
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.
DRIVE SAFE.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.458
WHAT A NIGHT.

39:24.375 --> 39:26.875
- YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

39:26.875 --> 39:29.291
- I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

39:32.667 --> 39:36.333
- ANGEL?

39:36.333 --> 39:39.375
- THIS IS YASMIN ARAGON.

39:39.375 --> 39:41.875
- WHAT IS SHE DOING
ON MY COUCH?

39:41.875 --> 39:46.709
- MISS ARAGON IS FRIENDS
WITH LOS HERMANOS FUENTES.

39:46.709 --> 39:50.959
SHE ALSO HAS A BOATLOAD
OF DRUG CHARGES

39:50.959 --> 39:52.959
AGAINST HER.

39:52.959 --> 39:56.250
SEEMS LIKE A TRADE
IS IN ORDER.

39:56.250 --> 39:59.500
- SO ARE WE
GONNA DO THIS OR NOT?

40:01.583 --> 40:04.250
- GIVE US A MINUTE.

40:07.375 --> 40:09.333
- EXCUSE ME.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.166
I SAW THAT SHE WAS WEARING
A SANTA MUERTE NECKLACE,

40:23.166 --> 40:25.458
SO I INTRODUCED MYSELF.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.208
IF WE AGREE TO DROP
HER DRUG CHARGES,

40:28.208 --> 40:29.375
SHE THINKS SHE CAN GET

40:29.375 --> 40:31.250
THE FUENTES BROTHERS
IN THE CLUB.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.667
THAT IS...

40:33.667 --> 40:38.125
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE US
ANOTHER CHANCE.

40:38.125 --> 40:42.166
I'M SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING...

40:42.166 --> 40:45.166
ABOUT LOSING MY TEMPER,
ABOUT WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.208
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

40:47.208 --> 40:50.083
- SAY THAT AGAIN?

40:50.083 --> 40:53.083
- YOU WERE RIGHT.
- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.583
- I DID GO TO I.A.D.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.500
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
MY HUSBAND DISCIPLINED.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.500
I REALLY LIKE
BEING MARRIED TO YOU, ANGEL.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.000
- AND I YOU.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
- IT'S SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME

41:03.000 --> 41:05.750
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
MAKING A NAME FOR MYSELF,

41:05.750 --> 41:07.458
AND NOW I'M THIS CLOSE
TO MAKING CAPTAIN.

41:07.458 --> 41:09.709
- AND I WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING TO STOP YOU.

41:09.709 --> 41:11.792
- NOT ON PURPOSE, I KNOW.

41:11.792 --> 41:14.083
BUT GET A STINK ON YOU,

41:14.083 --> 41:16.667
AND I START TO STINK TOO.

41:16.667 --> 41:19.834
- WE'LL STOCK UP
ON DEODORANT.

41:19.834 --> 41:22.291
- [laughs]

41:22.291 --> 41:24.250
NICE JOB
BRINGING IN THE GIRL.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.417
- YEAH.

41:27.959 --> 41:31.083
BETTER THAN A PUPPY?

41:31.083 --> 41:33.000
- I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT HOME.

41:46.834 --> 41:49.458
- HELLO?

42:02.834 --> 42:03.875
HEY.

42:03.875 --> 42:05.625
- HEY.

42:05.625 --> 42:06.917
LAST ONE.

42:06.917 --> 42:09.667
SORRY.

42:09.667 --> 42:11.208
- YOU GOT GLITTER
ON YOUR FACE.

42:11.208 --> 42:13.166
- YEAH...

42:13.166 --> 42:15.500
HAZARD OF THE JOB.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.542
- I'M NOT SURE
IT'S IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION

42:17.542 --> 42:19.959
THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR FACE
IN BOOBIE MCGEE'S TITS.

42:19.959 --> 42:21.166
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

42:21.166 --> 42:23.000
THE FIRST RULE OF WORKING
UNDERCOVER IS TO BLEND IN.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.208
- YOU DISAPPEARED.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.166
- I DID, DIDN'T I?

42:27.166 --> 42:30.208
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

42:30.208 --> 42:31.917
[sighs]
FUCK.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.542
I...

42:36.542 --> 42:38.375
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

42:38.375 --> 42:40.959
- YOU DO?

42:40.959 --> 42:42.917
- I TRIED NOT TO.

42:45.166 --> 42:47.917
- I LIKE YOU TOO...

42:47.917 --> 42:52.083
UH, MORE THAN "LIKE."

42:52.083 --> 42:52.959
- YOU DO?

42:52.959 --> 42:54.458
- YEAH.

42:54.458 --> 42:58.041
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KEEPS PUTTING THE BRAKES ON.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.875
- WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT ANYMORE?

43:00.875 --> 43:03.500
- THAT'D MAKE ME VERY HAPPY.

43:07.166 --> 43:11.083
- IF THIS
IS GONNA END BADLY...

43:11.083 --> 43:13.375
WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST TELL ME NOW?

43:15.542 --> 43:19.750
- MORGAN, I JUST SAID
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

43:19.750 --> 43:23.417
I MEAN,
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

43:23.417 --> 43:26.166
- WELL, I MEAN,
SOMETIMES YOU MUMBLE,

43:26.166 --> 43:28.667
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

43:28.667 --> 43:30.583
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

43:30.583 --> 43:33.041
- HOW'S THIS?

43:45.792 --> 43:49.083
- I TRIED TO SEND THIS WOMAN
1,500 MILES AWAY,

43:49.083 --> 43:50.166
AND SHE BOOMERANGED

43:50.166 --> 43:52.750
BACK INTO THE HOUSE
I SHARED WITH RITA.

43:52.750 --> 43:54.667
LUMEN?

43:54.667 --> 43:55.750
SO MUCH FOR KEEPING

43:55.750 --> 43:57.917
THE DIFFERENT PARTS
OF MY LIFE SEPARATE.

44:19.458 --> 44:21.458
SORRY,
I'LL JUST BE IN HERE.

44:27.667 --> 44:30.500
[water ripples]

44:30.500 --> 44:33.875
THERE ARE TOWELS...
SOMEWHERE.

44:33.875 --> 44:38.333
- I FOUND SOME IN A BOX.

44:38.333 --> 44:40.291
I ALSO FOUND THIS ROBE.

44:40.291 --> 44:42.959
IS IT OKAY IF I BORROW IT?

44:42.959 --> 44:45.500
- SURE.

44:48.333 --> 44:52.417
- THE TUB'S NOT DRAINING.

44:52.417 --> 44:54.834
- SOMETIMES
THE THINGY GETS STUCK.

45:04.667 --> 45:06.125
- ARE YOU OKAY?

45:06.125 --> 45:07.667
DO YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN?

45:07.667 --> 45:09.291
- [sighs]

45:12.834 --> 45:14.875
YEAH, FOR A MINUTE.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.375
- I KNOW YOU...

45:22.375 --> 45:24.208
WHAT YOU ARE...

45:24.208 --> 45:26.125
DEEP DOWN--

45:26.125 --> 45:27.625
ASIDE FROM YOUR POLICE JOB

45:27.625 --> 45:31.166
AND YOUR
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

45:33.375 --> 45:35.917
YOU'RE A FATHER.

45:35.917 --> 45:39.250
I SAW THE PICTURES
OUT THERE.

45:39.250 --> 45:40.750
THREE CHILDREN?

45:43.875 --> 45:47.208
- THE TWO OLDEST
ARE WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS--

45:47.208 --> 45:51.542
THEIR DAD'S MOM AND DAD.

45:51.542 --> 45:54.166
- YOU HAVE A SON?

45:54.166 --> 45:56.041
- HARRISON.

45:58.250 --> 46:00.291
HE JUST STARTED TALKING...

46:00.291 --> 46:03.041
TODAY.

46:06.083 --> 46:08.542
HE'S TREMENDOUS.

46:11.917 --> 46:14.750
- IT'S...

46:14.750 --> 46:16.792
JUST THE TWO OF YOU?

46:16.792 --> 46:18.417
- [sighs]

46:18.417 --> 46:21.875
AND AN IRISH
SUPERHERO NANNY.

46:28.166 --> 46:30.875
NEVER THOUGHT MY LIFE
WOULD TURN OUT LIKE THIS.

46:36.750 --> 46:38.917
- I HAD IMAGINED...

46:38.917 --> 46:42.542
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFE
FOR MYSELF TOO.

46:42.542 --> 46:45.041
I ALWAYS DID EVERYTHING
BY THE BOOK, YOU KNOW?

46:45.041 --> 46:46.333
GO, GO, GO.

46:46.333 --> 46:49.917
NEVER STOPPED TO THINK.

46:49.917 --> 46:54.083
THERE WAS HIGH SCHOOL AND
COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL...

46:54.083 --> 46:56.583
OWEN.

46:59.125 --> 47:04.291
WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED
AT THE HOUSE THAT I GREW UP IN.

47:04.291 --> 47:07.333
ON MY WEDDING DAY, I...

47:07.333 --> 47:09.792
I TRIED ON THE DRESS,
AND I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW

47:09.792 --> 47:13.041
AT THE BACKYARD
WHERE THE AISLE WAS, AND...

47:13.041 --> 47:17.625
I SAW EVERYTHING
THAT THAT AISLE WAS LEADING TO--

47:17.625 --> 47:20.458
BABIES AND...

47:20.458 --> 47:23.333
MATCHING DINNERWARE...

47:23.333 --> 47:25.792
SUNDAY BARBECUES.

47:27.417 --> 47:30.667
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE.

47:30.667 --> 47:33.166
I HAD TO GET
OUT OF THERE AND...

47:33.166 --> 47:37.250
FIND SOMETHING...

47:37.250 --> 47:39.834
MORE.

47:47.625 --> 47:52.291
THEN EVERYTHING HAPPENED,
AND...

47:52.291 --> 47:54.458
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT,

47:54.458 --> 47:57.208
"THIS IS WHAT I GET

47:57.208 --> 48:00.709
FOR TRYING TO...

48:00.709 --> 48:03.041
LIVE MY OWN LIFE."

48:05.041 --> 48:07.083
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

48:09.709 --> 48:12.083
- A LITTLE.

48:15.542 --> 48:19.917
- BUT TONIGHT
I FELT THIS, LIKE...

48:19.917 --> 48:22.333
THIS...

48:22.333 --> 48:24.500
PEACE.

48:26.542 --> 48:28.542
AND IT'S BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

48:35.709 --> 48:40.041
[voice breaking] AND I KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT GONNA LAST.

48:40.041 --> 48:41.333
AND WHEN IT WEARS OFF,

48:41.333 --> 48:45.083
I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND
THE REST OF THEM...

48:45.083 --> 48:46.792
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

48:46.792 --> 48:49.417
THAT I'LL FIND
THAT PEACE AGAIN.

48:54.083 --> 48:58.375
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A NAME
FOR WHAT I'M FEELING.

48:58.375 --> 48:59.709
- I DO...

48:59.709 --> 49:02.625
THE DARK PASSENGER.

49:02.625 --> 49:05.250
I CAN'T GET REVENGE
FOR RITA'S DEATH,

49:05.250 --> 49:09.208
BUT I CAN HELP LUMEN
AVENGE WHAT WAS DONE TO HER.

49:14.959 --> 49:18.542
HOW MANY MORE WERE THERE?

49:23.166 --> 49:26.166
