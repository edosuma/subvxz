WEBVTT

00:07.116 --> 00:08.401
Let's move! Let's go!

00:09.302 --> 00:10.607
Get those VA's on!

00:10.896 --> 00:13.288
Pull it two and a half,
let's get ready to roll.

00:14.418 --> 00:16.105
Davis, get those utilities turned off.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.332
Quickly! Move it!

00:17.356 --> 00:18.418
I'm on it, sir!

00:18.442 --> 00:19.954
We're in front! You take the back!

00:19.978 --> 00:21.890
Scotty, you're with me! Let's move!

00:22.835 --> 00:24.617
Let's go.

00:26.556 --> 00:27.621
You two spread out.

00:27.656 --> 00:29.591
Clear the bedrooms,
I'll take the kitchen.

00:29.626 --> 00:30.432
We'll cover this side here.

00:30.456 --> 00:32.444
All right! I'm going right!

00:40.418 --> 00:42.075
Every damn time.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.365
False alarm, fellas!

00:43.400 --> 00:45.380
Just another over cooked bird.

00:45.574 --> 00:46.983
Or something.

00:50.927 --> 00:53.183
Tough to tell after six hours in the...

00:53.301 --> 00:54.880
oven.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.834
Double Americano for Thom.

02:04.676 --> 02:05.732
Aren't you Thom?

02:06.919 --> 02:08.881
Yes. Thank you. Sorry.

02:08.905 --> 02:11.145
Must need that badly. Don't
even recognize your own name.

02:11.169 --> 02:12.498
Medium mocha coming up.

02:12.522 --> 02:14.321
It's... my other name.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.174
- Two names?
- Well, two jobs.

02:17.198 --> 02:18.241
It's Thom when I'm writing.

02:18.265 --> 02:20.782
Not that I've actually
written anything in weeks.

02:20.806 --> 02:21.948
Writer's block?

02:25.443 --> 02:26.893
Creative stifling.

02:26.917 --> 02:30.269
I am crumbling under the
pressure of expectations.

02:31.112 --> 02:32.735
You're Thom E. Gemcity.

02:32.759 --> 02:35.984
Your photo's on the back
cover. I loved Deep Six.

02:36.008 --> 02:37.329
Thanks.

02:37.353 --> 02:38.411
Landon. Thank you.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.680
Can't wait to see what happens next.

02:40.704 --> 02:42.021
You and me both.

02:42.045 --> 02:44.960
Two weeks until my deadline,
I'm stuck here in Chapter Seven.

02:44.984 --> 02:46.341
Well, could be worse.

02:46.652 --> 02:47.712
How's that?

02:47.736 --> 02:49.277
Could be Chapter Six.

02:50.750 --> 02:54.707
Okay, we got a half-caf percent
latte and a medium double decaf...

02:54.731 --> 02:55.779
McGee.

02:55.803 --> 02:57.894
- And there you go.
- Yeah.

03:00.362 --> 03:02.221
- The other job.
- Good luck.

03:04.856 --> 03:06.844
Ferris Bueller's Day Off...

03:06.868 --> 03:08.454
John Hughes masterpiece.

03:08.811 --> 03:11.460
Now, there's a guy who didn't have
time for writer's block, probie.

03:11.484 --> 03:15.436
Sixteen Candles, Uncle
Buck, The Breakfast Club.

03:15.857 --> 03:17.226
I do not have...

03:19.031 --> 03:23.053
I'm just struggling to find out the
most efficient way to tell my next story.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.579
Now, do you think Hughes
writes on a computer

03:25.603 --> 03:27.975
or does he use an old-fashioned
typewriter, like you?

03:28.697 --> 03:31.622
Well, I'm sure he uses a
computer, Tony. Most write do.

03:32.043 --> 03:33.532
You ever consider converting?

03:34.238 --> 03:36.590
I don't think that's
the reason for my...

03:37.342 --> 03:39.420
Were you gonna say writer's block?

03:40.861 --> 03:42.074
I like my typewriter.

03:42.098 --> 03:43.898
But it doesn't like you.

03:44.983 --> 03:49.268
It's a classic tale of unrequited
love between a boy and his machine.

03:49.292 --> 03:52.786
You can use that if you want. But
remember you got to have a love story.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.392
I can see the poster already.

03:55.821 --> 03:57.903
The house is leased to
Petty Officer Darren Cove.

03:57.927 --> 04:01.144
No roommates, but according to
the neighbors, he's rarely alone.

04:01.535 --> 04:04.452
I can tell. Got a fridge full of beer.

04:05.366 --> 04:06.444
No hard alcohol.

04:06.468 --> 04:07.683
Except for this.

04:09.961 --> 04:12.702
If smells could kill, I think
we just found our murder weapon.

04:12.726 --> 04:14.446
I'm more concerned with
where they came from.

04:14.470 --> 04:17.471
Neighbors said this was
a notorious party house.

04:17.495 --> 04:19.522
Maybe someone brought in the mixers.

04:19.546 --> 04:21.055
Then they left with them, too.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.719
Seems like a lot of effort
for a couple of drinks.

04:23.743 --> 04:25.483
Wasted effort.

04:25.507 --> 04:27.852
The blood search at
the Ping-Pong table.

04:28.303 --> 04:29.687
Beer-pong.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.224
This is tragic, don't tell me you've
never played beer-pong before, probie.

04:35.848 --> 04:38.094
What did you do at MIT?

04:38.118 --> 04:39.133
Studied.

04:39.157 --> 04:42.101
That figures. Beer-pong
is a drinking game,

04:42.125 --> 04:45.030
the object of which is to
take the Ping-Pong ball,

04:45.436 --> 04:48.138
and try and get it into
the other team's cups.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.162
Show me how it's done.

04:52.499 --> 04:55.162
This is a crime scene, not a frat house.

04:57.206 --> 04:58.956
You hearing voices, probie?

05:00.229 --> 05:01.863
Figured you saw Gibbs coming.

05:01.887 --> 05:06.427
I just don't think this is the time or
the place to showcase my beer-pong skills.

05:08.924 --> 05:10.172
What?

05:10.427 --> 05:12.035
Seems out of character.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.988
Yeah, yeah.

05:15.469 --> 05:17.822
No, you may not use me to
get over your writer's block.

05:17.846 --> 05:20.645
McGee has writer's
block? No, McGee does not.

05:21.623 --> 05:24.712
Just do what you did last
time... write about us.

05:24.736 --> 05:27.972
Okay, I've told you guys a million
times, the book is not about you.

05:27.996 --> 05:31.161
No, of course not... it's
about Special Agent Tommy.

05:31.185 --> 05:33.015
And Officer Lisa.

05:33.039 --> 05:34.271
DiNozzo!

05:34.512 --> 05:35.640
And L.J. Tibbs.

05:42.451 --> 05:43.498
Get this.

05:48.139 --> 05:51.372
Looks like McGee wasn't
the only writer here today.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.357
Bag it.

05:55.477 --> 05:59.455
Petty Officer Cove joined the Navy three
years ago, right out of high school.

05:59.479 --> 06:02.415
His CO says he's a little
immature, but basically a good kid.

06:02.439 --> 06:04.244
Good kid with a criminal record.

06:04.268 --> 06:07.807
Since enlisting, he's been
arrested twice, both misdemeanors.

06:07.831 --> 06:11.341
Public intox in '04, and a noise
ordinance violation last July.

06:11.365 --> 06:14.127
"Works to live, and lives to party".

06:14.969 --> 06:17.112
His... CO's words.

06:17.136 --> 06:20.824
Guys in his command call
him Darren "Diddy" Cove.

06:21.606 --> 06:22.649
Why?

06:23.516 --> 06:25.389
It's a reference to Sean Diddy Combs.

06:25.413 --> 06:27.229
The Puff Man, P Diddy.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.936
Rap impresario. Went out with J-Lo.

06:31.503 --> 06:33.335
Petty Officer Cove
was on duty yesterday.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.604
Left the base at 1800,
hasn't been seen since.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.980
And neither has his blue Ford Ranger.

06:38.004 --> 06:39.866
Should be in his garage, but it's not.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.520
Which means lis attacker took it.

06:41.544 --> 06:43.550
Went Petty Officer Cove for a drive.

06:43.574 --> 06:45.921
With that amount of blood loss,
it's doubtful he was conscious.

06:45.945 --> 06:47.787
If it was all his blood.

06:48.772 --> 06:52.286
Well, Abby'll tell us, because Cove's
blood sample is in his medical records.

06:53.911 --> 06:57.153
I'm gonna go check the BOLO, see
if he's got a hit on the pickup.

06:57.177 --> 06:58.542
That's not necessary, McGee.

06:58.566 --> 07:01.801
Norfolk Police just found
it abandoned along Highway 5.

07:06.734 --> 07:10.666
I've noticed oversized dice
like these in numerous vehicles.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.388
Do they serve a purpose?

07:13.727 --> 07:14.802
Hello?

07:14.826 --> 07:15.878
Tony?

07:16.506 --> 07:18.919
- What?
- Do they serve a purpose?

07:18.943 --> 07:21.101
Fuzzy dice... pretty
good redneck indicator.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.673
Other than that, no, they
don't serve a purpose.

07:23.697 --> 07:25.793
Got a lot more blood back here, boss.

07:25.817 --> 07:27.855
Think this was used to cover the body?

07:27.879 --> 07:30.481
Yeah. Or bodies.

07:31.068 --> 07:32.948
Yeah, Abs... I'm listening.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.450
McGee, you look like you've seen a goat.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.003
Ghost. "Seen a ghost".

07:49.800 --> 07:50.859
Yeah.

07:51.544 --> 07:52.859
Do you know what déjà vu is?

07:52.883 --> 07:55.895
Bien sûr. My French is
better than my English.

07:56.150 --> 07:57.330
Right.

07:57.354 --> 07:58.654
So...

07:58.678 --> 07:59.700
What?

08:00.806 --> 08:03.182
- The déjà vu.
- I can't place it.

08:08.633 --> 08:11.953
By any chance, did you
start dating someone, McGee?

08:12.900 --> 08:16.686
Dating? Please, I spend every
spare minute I have writing.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.610
Hang on a second. McGee.

08:18.634 --> 08:21.559
Get this towed back to
lockup. Yeah, go on, Abs.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.206
Abby's got something.

08:35.399 --> 08:39.020
Watch out! It's Halloween
at Coyote Ugly, Piper Perabo.

08:39.044 --> 08:41.799
Oh, if you like that one,
you're gonna love this.

08:41.823 --> 08:43.981
It's a, uh, it's a Sciuto original.

08:44.005 --> 08:46.124
I like to call it "Bottoms Up".

08:48.286 --> 08:50.278
I had no idea you
were a bartender, Abby.

08:50.302 --> 08:52.539
Well, my Uncle Teddy used
to own a bar on Canal Street,

08:52.563 --> 08:54.758
and I used to bartend
there on the weekends.

08:57.134 --> 08:58.773
The case, Abby?

08:59.915 --> 09:03.283
But, Gibbs, you haven't even
seen my famous Fire Bomb.

09:06.637 --> 09:07.756
It can wait.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.361
So, uh, I tested the blood that
was in Petty Officer Cove's house.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.048
Most of it was his, but
one sample did not match.

09:14.072 --> 09:17.738
It could've been from a prior accident
or an altercation at one of his parties.

09:17.762 --> 09:20.811
- Or it could be the killer's.
- I also ran...

09:21.187 --> 09:23.855
the prints from our mystery cocktails.

09:23.879 --> 09:27.238
One half of our drinking duo was
definitely Petty Officer Cove.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.238
- The other half?
- Well, it's a work in progress, Gibbs.

09:30.262 --> 09:32.280
Tell me you have more than this, Abby.

09:32.304 --> 09:35.363
Have I ever let you
down? Don't answer that.

09:36.341 --> 09:39.675
I'm using my mass spectrometer to
break down the molecular structure

09:39.699 --> 09:41.368
of the cocktails in question.

09:41.392 --> 09:44.272
- Guessing that's where all these come in.
- Well, you guessed correctly.

09:44.296 --> 09:49.062
I think I've made over 100
delightful beverages trying to find...

09:50.490 --> 09:51.829
the match.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.589
The weirding is, this baby isn't
in any bartending guide anywhere.

09:55.613 --> 09:57.725
It's made out of Jagermeister...

09:57.749 --> 10:02.489
Cherry soda, vanilla vodka, lemon
juice and a splash of Tabasco.

10:03.677 --> 10:05.722
It's called a "Hairy Hangover."

10:06.248 --> 10:09.184
And you came to know this how, McGee?

10:10.658 --> 10:11.921
I created it.

10:14.142 --> 10:17.436
Our missing petty officer is
a character in my next book.

10:26.790 --> 10:29.617
"Cameron Meyer is a good old
boy from Northern Virginia.

10:29.641 --> 10:32.239
"He was born with not
much, raised with even less.

10:32.263 --> 10:34.992
"All he wants out of life is
a good girl and a great truck.

10:35.016 --> 10:36.833
"As of yesterday, he's halfway there.

10:36.857 --> 10:40.796
"He dropped his life savings
on a blue Ford Ranger".

10:41.497 --> 10:43.669
- That's it?
- Tony, it's all here.

10:43.693 --> 10:46.866
The fuzzy dice, the cinnamon
rolls, red track jacket.

10:46.890 --> 10:49.084
Petty Officer Cove is Cameron Meyer.

10:49.108 --> 10:51.558
But how is that possible, McGee?

10:56.331 --> 10:59.428
My writing isn't entirely fiction. Okay.

10:59.452 --> 11:03.838
My stories are, but sometimes I
base my characters on people I...

11:03.862 --> 11:05.142
Work with.

11:05.455 --> 11:08.054
See. People I see.

11:08.078 --> 11:10.069
You've seen Petty Officer Cove before?

11:10.093 --> 11:11.888
Every morning at my coffee shop.

11:11.912 --> 11:14.069
But how come you didn't
recognize his photograph?

11:14.093 --> 11:15.557
He only uses the drive-through.

11:15.581 --> 11:19.155
To me, he's just the large coffee with
acinnamon roll guy in the blue pickup.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.328
I never saw his face.

11:20.352 --> 11:22.433
Whoa, whoa, wait-wait
a minute. Back up.

11:22.457 --> 11:24.891
Your coffee shop has a drive-through?

11:25.096 --> 11:26.715
That's... That's not important.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.723
Just because you based your
character on a person who is missing,

11:29.747 --> 11:32.678
does not necessarily mean the
two of them are related, McGee.

11:32.702 --> 11:34.130
Yeah, it does.

11:34.536 --> 11:36.107
You created the drink.

11:36.131 --> 11:37.686
Made it up about a month ago.

11:37.710 --> 11:42.254
How did two glasses of it get from your
head to inside Petty Officer Cove's house?

11:42.278 --> 11:43.698
Someone's read your book.

11:43.722 --> 11:45.781
Your papers under lock and key?

11:47.645 --> 11:50.338
Well, I sent my publisher a
copy a couple weeks ago, but,

11:50.362 --> 11:52.522
- you know, I'm sure she...
- Address.

11:58.971 --> 12:00.821
Boss, there's more.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.253
After Deep Six hit the stores,

12:04.277 --> 12:09.118
my publishing firm received a ton of
e-mails addressed to Thom E. Gemcity.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.028
Tons?

12:17.236 --> 12:20.898
Most of them are autograph
requests or feedback on the novel,

12:20.922 --> 12:23.910
but in the last couple weeks, my
publisher says that we've gotten

12:23.934 --> 12:26.451
some really weird letters,
borderline obsessive.

12:26.475 --> 12:29.113
I didn't say anything because
I assumed they were harmless.

12:29.137 --> 12:30.661
DiNozzo, with me.

12:30.685 --> 12:33.450
McGee, you stay here with Ziva.
Start going through your book.

12:33.474 --> 12:36.481
- What exactly am I looking for?
- Answers, McGee.

12:41.297 --> 12:43.890
Miss Crawshaw will be with you shortly.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.621
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

12:48.073 --> 12:50.442
Is there anything else I
can get you while you wait?

12:50.466 --> 12:52.786
- Yeah, a barf bag.
- I'm sorry.

12:52.890 --> 12:53.890
Todd,

12:54.177 --> 12:57.489
black tea, lemon, crab salad,

12:58.069 --> 12:59.211
arugula.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.373
You're Timothy's people.

13:02.894 --> 13:05.452
A few weeks ago, he sent
you a draft of his next book?

13:05.636 --> 13:07.255
Partial. It wasn't finished yet.

13:07.279 --> 13:09.405
Yeah, it still isn't, is it?

13:09.429 --> 13:11.397
How many of your people
here have read the book?

13:11.485 --> 13:12.533
Zero.

13:12.819 --> 13:17.190
No one in my agency has access to advance
material without the writer's consent.

13:17.870 --> 13:19.157
Except you.

13:22.639 --> 13:26.185
Writers are notoriously
insecure. Soft, even.

13:26.209 --> 13:29.397
Well, thatoesn't sound like
our little Timmy McGee, does it?

13:29.421 --> 13:35.095
Whether they ask for it or not, I
provide coddling, prodding, protection.

13:35.785 --> 13:39.376
Anything it takes to keep
those elusive muses singing.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.990
Agent...?

13:41.145 --> 13:42.221
Gibbs.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.551
Here we go. Rock Hollow:

13:46.575 --> 13:49.194
The Continuing Adventures of L.J. Tibbs.

13:49.815 --> 13:51.674
How is this connected
with your investigation?

13:51.698 --> 13:54.874
A person's missing. We believe it's
related to the contents of that book.

13:56.304 --> 13:58.836
Guess I just made myself
your prime suspect.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.210
Sounds about right.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.942
I may be the only one in the firm
who's read it, Agent Gibbs, but

14:04.966 --> 14:08.012
I can guarantee you I'm not
the only one in the city.

14:08.036 --> 14:11.610
McGee hasn't given the book
to anyone else, Miss Crawshaw.

14:11.634 --> 14:16.546
Obsessed fans always find
a way to get material early.

14:16.570 --> 14:19.076
They dig through trash, hack computers,

14:19.100 --> 14:21.100
anything short of writing it themselves.

14:21.124 --> 14:24.878
And believe me, Timothy has some
of the craziest fans I've ever seen.

14:24.902 --> 14:26.218
Yeah, we know about the letters.

14:26.242 --> 14:29.261
Yeah, there are three that stand
out. Todd, bring me those three...

14:29.285 --> 14:30.888
Gemcity letters?

14:30.912 --> 14:32.255
No return addresses.

14:32.279 --> 14:34.444
Each one's stranger than the last.

14:34.468 --> 14:38.031
I bet the psychopath you're looking
for is somewhere in that envelope.

14:38.073 --> 14:40.161
What makes you think we're
looking for a psychopath?

14:40.185 --> 14:41.938
Don't you read crime novels?

14:43.235 --> 14:45.230
There are always psychopaths.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.840
"I am sending this letter
to express my gratitude

14:50.864 --> 14:53.783
"for the literary gift you've given me.

14:53.807 --> 14:56.570
"The majesty of your
writing is far beyond

14:56.594 --> 14:58.633
anything this planet has ever seen".

14:58.657 --> 15:00.036
A rave review.

15:00.060 --> 15:01.663
Rave, indeed, Jethro.

15:01.687 --> 15:04.898
Yeah. In fact, it's quite
possible that Michael

15:05.705 --> 15:07.633
is Timothy's greatest admirer.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.039
Admirer, or stalker, Duck?

15:10.063 --> 15:14.872
At this point, I'd say he is no mediate
threat to himself or anyone else.

15:14.896 --> 15:15.876
At this point?

15:15.900 --> 15:19.267
Well, one does not become a
predatory stalker overnight, Jethro.

15:19.291 --> 15:22.294
The mind typically goes
through three stages.

15:22.318 --> 15:25.706
This letter, strange as it may
seem, is only at stage one...

15:26.187 --> 15:27.635
the attraction stage.

15:27.659 --> 15:28.696
And the other two?

15:28.720 --> 15:33.706
Well, on the surface this
letter, written by Andrew,

15:33.730 --> 15:35.294
would appear more normal,

15:35.318 --> 15:38.110
but phrases like "I
breathe for your words"

15:38.134 --> 15:40.638
and "you need me", might suggest...

15:40.662 --> 15:42.222
Otherwise.

15:43.222 --> 15:45.790
Yeah, because of that
sense of desperation,

15:45.814 --> 15:49.231
I categorized that
letter as stage two...

15:49.472 --> 15:50.698
obsession.

15:50.722 --> 15:51.893
What's stage three?

15:51.917 --> 15:54.067
Well, read for yourself.

15:57.152 --> 16:00.438
"I know you think of me
often, just as I think of you.

16:00.462 --> 16:03.385
Please don't make me do
something we'll both regret".

16:03.409 --> 16:07.138
Now, that letter as an
aggressive, and threatening tone.

16:07.162 --> 16:10.671
For that reason, it falls
into the final stage...

16:11.619 --> 16:13.110
destruction.

16:13.134 --> 16:15.514
Three letters. Three stages.

16:15.538 --> 16:18.827
I know what you're thinking,
Jethro, but it's no coincidence.

16:18.851 --> 16:21.575
Although the letters may
appear to be very different,

16:21.599 --> 16:25.052
the writing style is nearly
identical in all three.

16:25.377 --> 16:27.477
The same person wrote all three.

16:27.501 --> 16:31.043
And judging by the postmarks, the
letters were written and sent over

16:31.067 --> 16:33.486
a period of several
weeks. During which time,

16:33.769 --> 16:37.444
the writer became
increasingly delusional.

16:37.473 --> 16:38.577
Motive?

16:38.601 --> 16:39.951
I can't say for certain,

16:39.975 --> 16:43.264
but I'd say the answers can
be found in Timothy's new book.

16:43.288 --> 16:45.008
The writer believes

16:45.032 --> 16:49.516
that Timothy's fiction
is very much real.

17:04.311 --> 17:06.137
Tony, you about...

17:12.727 --> 17:13.727
Done.

17:15.236 --> 17:16.262
So?

17:16.482 --> 17:17.570
I'm confused.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.641
This isn't a critique, okay?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.017
We're trying to find something useful...

17:23.856 --> 17:24.856
Confused by what?

17:26.404 --> 17:29.282
The plot, the back story,

17:29.306 --> 17:31.058
pretty much everything.

17:31.082 --> 17:33.048
The whole thing doesn't make sense.

17:34.152 --> 17:35.553
Ziva, what about you?

17:36.930 --> 17:38.909
Not as confused as Tony.

17:39.576 --> 17:42.256
Well, I haven't finished it
yet. It's just a rough draft.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.356
Very rough.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.892
I'm sorry, McGee.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.645
Who's the killer, anyway?

17:47.669 --> 17:48.834
I don't know yet.

17:49.413 --> 17:52.122
It's your problem, I mean
you always have to know.

17:52.146 --> 17:55.206
It's your problem where your story
is going. That's Fiction Writing 101.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.989
Not the way I choose to write, Tony.

17:57.013 --> 17:59.645
And he wonders why
he has writer's block.

17:59.669 --> 18:01.587
Can we focus on the problem here?

18:01.611 --> 18:04.956
We've got a missing person
and our only lead is my book.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.606
Well, that's not much of a lead.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.983
She's right. We don't even
know how the book factors in.

18:09.007 --> 18:10.459
We do now.

18:10.483 --> 18:12.707
The letters were written
by the same person.

18:12.731 --> 18:14.769
He thinks the book is real.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.851
And believes Petty Officer
Cove is a part of it.

18:17.875 --> 18:21.727
It means we're going to have
to go everywhere he's been.

18:21.751 --> 18:25.175
Well, we've already done that,
though. His home, work, hang out spots.

18:25.199 --> 18:27.646
I'm not talking about
Petty Officer Cove.

18:27.670 --> 18:31.439
I'm talking aboutyour good old
boy... with the pickup truck.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.731
Cameron Meyer.

18:34.142 --> 18:36.944
High Side Creek, where
Cameron goes to clear his head.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.091
Thematically, this location
is very important, boss.

18:40.115 --> 18:42.243
You've been saying the same
thing all morning, McGee.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.244
Spread out.

18:43.268 --> 18:45.856
Why would Cameron come
to a picnic area to think?

18:45.880 --> 18:49.043
In his book, it's not a picnic
area. It's his favorite fishing hole.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.896
- Thank you, Ziva.
- Don't you think it's kind of a cliché

18:51.920 --> 18:56.771
to have your character alone,
staring into the serene wilderness?

18:56.795 --> 18:59.618
No. If it was, I wouldn't
have written it, Tony.

18:59.673 --> 19:02.048
I mean, knowing Cameron,
if he was bummed out,

19:02.072 --> 19:06.096
wouldn't he just go to the Wing Shack with
his buddies, and toss back a few brews?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.741
Or talk to a priest?

19:07.765 --> 19:10.784
Don't forget that he's very
religious, now that his father died.

19:10.808 --> 19:11.838
Good point.

19:11.862 --> 19:13.183
No, it isn't.

19:13.655 --> 19:16.206
Cameron keeps his emotions bottled up.

19:16.230 --> 19:19.918
When he's upset, he comes here.
Afterwards, he always feels better.

19:20.428 --> 19:21.532
Not always.

19:34.235 --> 19:35.358
That's him.

19:36.617 --> 19:38.259
That's Petty Officer Cove.

19:39.362 --> 19:40.466
Then who is this?!

19:51.056 --> 19:52.410
That's Jared Brenner.

19:54.853 --> 19:57.315
That's another character from my book.

20:07.013 --> 20:10.512
Two bodies, both with nearly identical

20:10.536 --> 20:13.022
stab wounds in the chest and abdomen.

20:13.046 --> 20:17.873
It appears that Petty Officer Cove
may have put up a bit of a struggle.

20:18.141 --> 20:22.408
Note the remnants of skin tissue
and blood under the fingernails.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.982
Both men have been deceased
for less than 24 hours.

20:27.014 --> 20:28.734
That is not all they
hav in commun, Ducky.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.677
They're also both characters
in McGeek's next book.

20:31.701 --> 20:35.116
Yes. From what I hear,
Timothy, in your next novel,

20:35.140 --> 20:38.139
L.J. Tibbs has a love interest.

20:38.748 --> 20:41.527
Yes. I hear that it's an Army...

20:41.551 --> 20:43.762
Ducky, I don't think we
need to talk about that.

20:43.786 --> 20:44.891
Army what?

20:45.514 --> 20:46.646
McGee?

20:50.297 --> 20:51.500
Lieutenant.

20:52.826 --> 20:54.062
Colonel.

20:54.968 --> 20:56.269
Lieutenant colonel.

20:58.279 --> 20:59.763
You got a murder weapon, Duck?

20:59.787 --> 21:02.475
Yes, well, that's where
things get interesting, Jethro.

21:02.499 --> 21:06.984
Cove wounds are circular,
about one inch in diameter.

21:07.288 --> 21:08.288
- Javelin.
- Javelin.

21:08.669 --> 21:09.919
Chapter Four.

21:09.943 --> 21:11.932
My characters Cameron
Meyer and Jared Brenner...

21:11.956 --> 21:15.034
they murder a convenience store
clerk to cover up an extortion.

21:15.058 --> 21:16.916
Javelin. Believe it or not.

21:16.940 --> 21:20.735
That is for what they were
originally intended, Anthony.

21:21.103 --> 21:23.288
A javelin as a
modern-day murder weapon.

21:23.312 --> 21:26.721
I applaud your creativity, McGee.

21:27.710 --> 21:32.097
Of course, well... given
the circumstances...

21:35.019 --> 21:36.019
Oh, dear.

21:37.086 --> 21:39.803
Now I'm gonna have to read his new book.

21:40.397 --> 21:44.255
Petty Officer Darren Cove and
Adrian Corbett, the inspiration

21:44.279 --> 21:48.485
behind two of McGee's characters:
Cameron Meyer and Jared Brenner.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.697
- Any other connection?
- Not that we've found.

21:50.721 --> 21:53.340
Corbett worked as a valet
at Alfonso's Steakhouse.

21:53.364 --> 21:54.761
Your favorite.

21:55.044 --> 21:56.496
That's how I got to know him.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.620
For my book, I borrowed his
physical details... the nose ring,

21:59.644 --> 22:01.748
birthmark on the face and the neck.

22:01.772 --> 22:03.390
What was his job?

22:03.829 --> 22:05.348
Valet at a steakhouse.

22:05.372 --> 22:07.249
But I did change the
name of the restaurant.

22:07.273 --> 22:09.303
From Alfonso's to Alfredo's.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.807
Don't need to be Sherlock
Holmes to figure that one out.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.836
The note from Petty
Officer Cove's apartment.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.859
"One down, two to go". Means
the killer's not finished.

22:17.359 --> 22:20.204
How many more of your characters
did you base on real people?

22:26.207 --> 22:27.344
How many?

22:29.962 --> 22:31.193
Just the team.

22:31.547 --> 22:33.975
You. Tony, Ziva, everyone.

22:34.923 --> 22:37.072
You happy, Tony? I finally admitted it.

22:37.096 --> 22:39.903
- I based both my novels on you.
- That means we're all potential targets.

22:39.927 --> 22:41.757
- Boss, I'm sorry.
- Ducky, Abby, Palmer...

22:41.781 --> 22:44.499
24-hour security detail
until we find this psycho.

22:44.523 --> 22:47.562
27 javelins sold in the DC
area in the past six months.

22:47.586 --> 22:49.527
21 were paid for by credit cards,

22:49.962 --> 22:51.722
all by track coaches
and athletic directors.

22:51.746 --> 22:53.124
What about the last six?

22:53.148 --> 22:54.866
Cash transactions.

22:56.337 --> 22:58.329
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Got them for you, Gibbs.

22:58.353 --> 23:00.691
Got it, Abs. We'll
be right down. Go, go.

23:02.233 --> 23:03.535
Not you.

23:05.294 --> 23:07.364
Two men are dead because of me, boss.

23:07.388 --> 23:08.993
You got a javelin, McGee?

23:09.263 --> 23:10.988
No, but I own a typewriter.

23:12.305 --> 23:14.690
It's a typewriter, not a shotgun.

23:14.714 --> 23:19.100
It cost two men their lives because I
based my fictional book on real people.

23:19.383 --> 23:20.522
Then put these on.

23:23.155 --> 23:24.689
You just confessed, right?

23:24.713 --> 23:25.949
Not exactly.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.001
There's no mid ground, McGee.

23:28.025 --> 23:30.877
You either put on the cuffs
or you find who's responsible.

23:30.901 --> 23:33.002
- How?
- This guy's inside your head.

23:33.026 --> 23:35.254
- You get inside his!
- Boss, it's not that simple.

23:35.278 --> 23:38.141
- I still don't even know what my story is.
- You figure it out, McGee!

23:39.938 --> 23:43.515
You write the ending to
this or the killer will!

23:48.978 --> 23:50.566
Well, McGee feels bad enough.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.942
Only makes it worse that he admitted it.

23:52.966 --> 23:55.067
It was no secret he
was writing about us.

23:55.091 --> 23:56.755
Oh, come on. It's not about us.

23:56.779 --> 23:59.528
I mean, the whole part about
Lisa and her broken heart.

23:59.882 --> 24:03.228
The moment she keeps from her relationship
that never had a chance to happen.

24:03.252 --> 24:06.697
Yeah, whe's he getting that? Or
the scene between Lisa and Tommy

24:06.721 --> 24:10.434
where they pool out their hearts to
each other and spill their secrets?

24:11.715 --> 24:15.092
When he tries to explain the
profound nature of his identity crise.

24:15.116 --> 24:18.733
Yeah. I mean, the hidden struggle
between who he is and what he's becoming.

24:18.757 --> 24:20.738
- I don't even know what that is.
- Yeah, totally unrealistic.

24:20.762 --> 24:22.350
Would never happen.

24:27.281 --> 24:28.516
What do you got, Abs?

24:28.903 --> 24:30.091
Three hours sleep.

24:30.534 --> 24:31.756
My apartment flooded last night.

24:31.780 --> 24:35.082
Did you know tt trying to flush voodoo
dolls down the toilet is a bad idea?

24:35.106 --> 24:36.364
I do now.

24:36.817 --> 24:39.229
- Where's Gibbs?
- He's chomping up McGee.

24:39.484 --> 24:40.635
Chewing.

24:40.659 --> 24:44.901
So a little birdie
told me that both of you

24:44.925 --> 24:47.075
have read the first
half of McGee's new book.

24:47.811 --> 24:49.006
A little birdie?

24:49.204 --> 24:53.237
And don't even ask because I will not
reveal my source even if you torture me.

24:53.393 --> 24:55.026
- Ducky?
- Yes!

24:55.050 --> 24:57.204
All right, let's hear it.

24:57.228 --> 24:58.507
Hear what?

24:58.531 --> 25:01.102
The book. At the end of Deep Six,

25:01.126 --> 25:04.008
goth forensic specialist "Amy Sutton",

25:04.032 --> 25:07.195
she broke up with her boyfriend
because she was digging somebody else.

25:07.945 --> 25:09.714
Who's the somebody else?

25:10.520 --> 25:11.520
Oh, yeah...

25:12.634 --> 25:15.128
Yeah, that part really
didn't come up yet.

25:15.393 --> 25:17.933
Yeah, I think he's
planning on revealing it,

25:18.690 --> 25:20.815
you know, the second part of the book.

25:21.705 --> 25:23.997
You guys are so lying.

25:25.719 --> 25:27.026
He's gay!

25:28.059 --> 25:29.833
The somebody else! I had a feeling

25:29.857 --> 25:33.172
'cause Amy always wants
what Amy cannot have.

25:33.548 --> 25:35.638
- Does she know?
- Know what?

25:35.662 --> 25:38.605
Forensic specialist Amy, she fell
in love with a gay guy, Gibbs.

25:38.629 --> 25:40.526
- That why I'm here?
- No.

25:40.724 --> 25:42.620
Then Amy's on her own.

25:43.017 --> 25:44.432
We'll talk later.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.400
I ran the blood samples that
we pulled off the two bodies.

25:47.424 --> 25:52.185
Petty Officer Cove had unidentified
lood on his right forearm and hand.

25:53.342 --> 25:55.261
It matched the blood from his house.

25:55.285 --> 25:56.526
Our killer's DNA.

25:56.550 --> 25:58.427
I'm no investigator,
but odds a you're right.

25:58.451 --> 26:00.635
- That's good work, Abs.
- I also checked.

26:00.659 --> 26:06.255
Petty Officer Cove's Gord Ranger and
Thom E. Gemcity's c-mail for prints.

26:06.279 --> 26:09.271
- C-mail?
- Yeah, it's like cuckoo mail.

26:09.295 --> 26:12.360
No, no, no, I just made it
up. Nothing on the truck.

26:12.384 --> 26:15.019
All the latent prints
belong to Petty Officer Cove.

26:15.043 --> 26:17.828
But on the c-mail, there's
dozens of different prints.

26:17.852 --> 26:21.450
Well, that makes sense 'cause paper
mail gets processed through post offices,

26:21.474 --> 26:23.496
- delivery trucks, mailrooms.
- Exactly.

26:24.048 --> 26:28.754
The's still one spot that
only the sender touches.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.145
The back of the stamp.
You pulled a print?

26:32.169 --> 26:35.651
Not only did I pull a
print, I already got a match.

26:41.915 --> 26:45.385
Todd Ryder, arrested last year
for possession of marijuana.

27:13.843 --> 27:15.952
Looking for something Timothy?

27:19.355 --> 27:20.789
I'm just looking.

27:22.296 --> 27:23.874
Petty Officer Cove...

27:24.843 --> 27:26.491
wasn't just a partier.

27:26.515 --> 27:28.550
I called his elderly parents.

27:28.791 --> 27:31.159
Visited them every day for two hours.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.104
This guy,

27:35.490 --> 27:37.075
Adrian Corbett,

27:38.094 --> 27:39.842
he just got married.

27:41.296 --> 27:42.296
Yes,

27:42.842 --> 27:44.919
I took off his wedding ring.

27:46.625 --> 27:49.833
Not quite the notorious
playboy I made him out to be?

27:49.857 --> 27:51.562
Appearances can be deceptive.

27:52.435 --> 27:54.601
Every single word I wrote was wrong.

27:54.861 --> 27:57.141
No, every word you wrote was fiction.

27:58.046 --> 28:00.317
That's why they call them "characters".

28:00.341 --> 28:02.832
But they are not just
characters in book.

28:03.233 --> 28:04.527
They're real people...

28:05.486 --> 28:06.949
and real families.

28:09.422 --> 28:10.422
Were.

28:14.626 --> 28:18.702
I sympathize with the
way you feel, Timothy...

28:23.508 --> 28:26.387
but you are not to
blame for any of this.

28:29.423 --> 28:30.423
Tell them that.

28:38.857 --> 28:40.117
Todd!

28:41.943 --> 28:43.236
Oh, God.

28:44.914 --> 28:45.939
Look out!

28:45.963 --> 28:47.276
What do you call that?

28:47.300 --> 28:48.480
Running, I think.

28:52.583 --> 28:54.281
Todd! Hey!

28:55.781 --> 28:56.862
Where's his car?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.380
Where's his car?!

28:59.404 --> 29:01.396
Employee lot around back.

29:02.459 --> 29:04.961
Get out of the building! They know!

29:04.985 --> 29:06.354
They're chasing me!

29:10.461 --> 29:12.088
You should've left the top down.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.046
Put your hands on top of your head.

29:17.303 --> 29:19.185
Nice of you to join us, DiNozzo.

29:20.512 --> 29:22.642
I thought I was gaining ground.

29:22.666 --> 29:24.821
He got a very unorthodox running style.

29:24.845 --> 29:26.715
It's very effective, though.

29:26.739 --> 29:28.262
Not effective enough.

29:28.870 --> 29:30.384
I didn't want to do it.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.450
I told her it was a bad idea.

29:41.021 --> 29:42.503
I actually trusted her.

29:42.527 --> 29:44.552
There was no way you
could have known, McGee.

29:44.576 --> 29:47.150
Ziva's right, probie,
it's not your fault.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.778
But if you evenn think about
writing a third novel, I'll kill you.

29:51.061 --> 29:53.864
When Abby finds out who her
character really fell in love with,

29:54.303 --> 29:56.157
you will already be dead.

30:00.031 --> 30:03.371
I have been sitting here
half the night, Agent Gibbs.

30:03.881 --> 30:05.329
What am I beg charged with?

30:05.353 --> 30:07.661
Tampering with a federal investigation.

30:07.685 --> 30:09.902
That's ridiculous. I've answered
every question you've asked.

30:09.926 --> 30:11.052
Resisting arrest.

30:11.522 --> 30:13.906
I told you already, I wasn't running.

30:13.930 --> 30:15.822
I was late for an appointment.

30:15.846 --> 30:16.930
And murder.

30:19.616 --> 30:21.505
You think I murdered someone.

30:24.257 --> 30:27.612
Their names are Petty Officer
Darren Cove and Adrian Corbett.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.361
Never heard of them.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.074
Okay.

30:31.757 --> 30:35.482
Well, how about Cameron
Meyer and Jared Brenner?

30:35.813 --> 30:37.976
- Have you heard of them?
- I think so.

30:38.953 --> 30:41.578
They're characters in Tim's next book.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.173
A book someone is killing over.

30:44.197 --> 30:45.831
Too bad you can't findthem.

30:46.075 --> 30:47.306
I think we have.

30:49.090 --> 30:51.297
- You wrote the letters.
- What?! Why would I...?

30:51.321 --> 30:52.749
Todd gave you up.

30:53.061 --> 30:57.455
He said you told him to mail
the letters back to the agency.

31:02.804 --> 31:04.026
Well, I can explain.

31:04.050 --> 31:06.488
Well, I sure hope so.

31:06.512 --> 31:10.587
I wrote the letters, but
only to create a bigger buzz.

31:10.611 --> 31:13.963
Stalkers mean more press. More
press means increased revenue.

31:15.336 --> 31:17.940
You made up a stalker
to sell more books?

31:18.195 --> 31:19.558
Yes, I did.

31:21.619 --> 31:22.686
She's lying.

31:23.119 --> 31:25.043
If she is, she's quiet good.

31:25.067 --> 31:28.000
She publishes fictional
novels for a living, Ziva.

31:28.024 --> 31:29.962
She knows how to tell a good story.

31:30.415 --> 31:32.099
I'm with Ziva.

31:32.467 --> 31:34.781
This woman lives to sell books.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.597
Look, it may sound unorthodox,
but I do one interview

31:37.621 --> 31:40.377
about those letters and Gemcity's
book sales jump to the roof.

31:40.401 --> 31:41.855
I didn't think he needed that help.

31:41.879 --> 31:45.105
Well, there's no such
thing as enough sales.

31:46.831 --> 31:51.509
What I did might be wrong, but there's
no way I could ever kill anyone.

31:54.450 --> 31:56.196
Why should I believe you?

31:56.220 --> 31:59.719
Those letters were a
strategic business move.

31:59.743 --> 32:03.563
I would do anything to help
my client sell more books.

32:04.652 --> 32:06.068
Anything.

32:08.445 --> 32:10.659
Well played, boss. You
get her in round two?

32:11.069 --> 32:13.154
I won't be a round two, DiNozzo.

32:13.178 --> 32:15.587
- She didn't break.
- I know. I was there.

32:15.611 --> 32:17.327
She didn't do it, did she?

32:17.351 --> 32:19.624
She's your publisher. You tell me.

32:20.152 --> 32:22.109
I think she's telling the truth.

32:22.133 --> 32:23.526
That makes two of us.

32:23.550 --> 32:28.117
I compared Crawhaw's DNA to the mystery
blood pulled off of Petty Officer Cove.

32:28.344 --> 32:29.589
She did not do it.

32:39.394 --> 32:41.838
I read this a thounsand time
and I have come up with nothing.

32:42.048 --> 32:44.850
Then maybe we should spitball
ideas and see what sticks.

32:46.853 --> 32:49.179
What? Did I say it wrong?

32:49.203 --> 32:50.608
No, you got that right.

32:50.632 --> 32:53.367
No, that's good. So
start with what we know.

32:53.705 --> 32:54.979
Campfire.

32:55.969 --> 32:58.182
Well, we know there's
killer on the loose.

32:58.206 --> 33:01.181
One down, two to go. And he's
already killed number two.

33:01.205 --> 33:05.542
In your book, Cameron Meyer and Jared
Brenneronly have two things in common.

33:05.839 --> 33:08.305
They extorted money and both
murded a convenience store clerk.

33:08.329 --> 33:10.795
Maybe the killer was seeking
revenge for the clerk's death.

33:10.819 --> 33:14.009
No. The clerk's a throway character.
I didn't even bother to name him.

33:14.033 --> 33:17.145
Besides, the stalker letters are fake, so
we don't even know that he's delusional.

33:17.169 --> 33:20.176
He murdered two characters
from a work of fiction, McGee.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.809
Ok, so he's probably delusional,

33:22.833 --> 33:24.508
but that doesn't mean
he's looking for revenge.

33:24.532 --> 33:26.132
You've got to have a motive, probie.

33:26.156 --> 33:28.655
Well, I am not convinced that
the answer is in my book, Tony.

33:28.679 --> 33:31.438
Maybe the answer is
in how he got the book.

33:31.820 --> 33:33.315
He dinitely didn't get it from Crawshaw.

33:33.339 --> 33:35.634
She'd never do anything
to jeopardize sales.

33:35.658 --> 33:37.305
It means he got it from you.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.938
- But I keep everything locked up.
- It wasn't a question.

33:40.197 --> 33:42.518
It's you or Crawshaw.

33:43.197 --> 33:46.205
Trust your instincts,
Tim. They're usually right.

33:46.229 --> 33:48.629
Take the lead on this one.
All we can do is assist.

33:49.732 --> 33:50.751
Okay.

33:52.761 --> 33:54.048
From the beginning...

33:56.078 --> 33:57.158
page one.

34:02.163 --> 34:06.082
I'd say we played that one nicely, boss.
The whole good guy, bad guy technique.

34:06.106 --> 34:07.534
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.175
Assist.

34:12.348 --> 34:13.585
Hold the elevator!

34:20.876 --> 34:23.329
I am using muscle I
didn't even know I had.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.648
No wonder you only got to chapter six.

34:26.862 --> 34:27.914
Chapter seven.

34:34.101 --> 34:36.346
It's jazz. Helps me clear my mind.

34:37.337 --> 34:38.686
Coltrane is jazz, McGee.

34:38.710 --> 34:43.303
This is a soundtrack to a bad '70s
porno shot in the San Fernando Valley.

34:43.327 --> 34:46.360
I'm just trying to reenact every
detail of my writing process here, okay?

34:46.384 --> 34:49.869
I'm sorry, did you say something?
My ears are bleeding and I can't...

34:50.306 --> 34:51.536
I can't...

34:52.204 --> 34:53.353
Thank you.

34:53.378 --> 34:55.373
I'm trying to show you
what I do when I get stuck.

34:55.398 --> 34:56.975
Blocked. Whatever.

34:57.485 --> 34:58.636
Up. Come on.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.145
- I'm in the middle.
- Up.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.095
Okay.

35:05.675 --> 35:09.638
Now, sometimes when I'm in trouble,
I take a few minutes to free write.

35:10.574 --> 35:11.574
Free write?

35:12.216 --> 35:13.763
Stream of consciousness.

35:14.126 --> 35:17.676
About my characters, my story
arcs, my possible plotines,

35:17.700 --> 35:20.036
- everything... no filter.
- No filter...

35:20.060 --> 35:22.648
Whatever pops in my head
goes right to the page.

35:23.313 --> 35:26.158
Write... be free. Just do it.

35:26.978 --> 35:28.082
Free write!

35:28.824 --> 35:29.917
Be free...

35:31.074 --> 35:32.163
I get it.

35:33.578 --> 35:35.956
If I like it, I put it in my binder.

35:36.536 --> 35:37.917
If not...

35:40.751 --> 35:42.600
You always use your shredder?

35:42.624 --> 35:43.665
Always.

35:45.195 --> 35:48.569
You ever just take a stack of
pages and toss it in the trash?

35:48.593 --> 35:51.250
- Never.
- You ever misplaced a binder or

35:51.647 --> 35:52.894
lost a copy of a book?

35:52.918 --> 35:54.570
No and no.

35:54.594 --> 35:56.890
The only way the killer got my book

35:56.914 --> 36:00.479
is if he broke into my apartment,
made a copy and returned the original.

36:00.503 --> 36:02.757
I'm a federal investigator
so I'm sure I would know

36:02.781 --> 36:05.497
if someone was trying
to break into my place.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.143
We're missing something.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.927
While we are trying to figure it out,

36:09.951 --> 36:12.686
he is planning on how
to kill his next victim.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.191
Or he's already killed them.

36:16.355 --> 36:18.884
Sorry. I was just free thinking.

36:20.822 --> 36:24.897
It's like he's here in the room with
me looking over my shoulder as I write.

36:24.921 --> 36:25.921
Type.

36:28.563 --> 36:31.965
'Cause technically, what you do is type.
You don't really write. That would be...

36:32.432 --> 36:33.768
I type.

36:35.468 --> 36:36.964
That's how he does it.

36:37.421 --> 36:39.198
Looked over your shoulder?

36:41.270 --> 36:42.434
I type.

36:43.438 --> 36:44.655
Tony, I type!

36:47.415 --> 36:48.495
Boss, I got it.

36:48.519 --> 36:49.797
Film?

36:49.821 --> 36:51.458
It's from my typewriter.

36:51.482 --> 36:54.205
- Typewriter ribbons.
- It's how the killer read my book.

36:55.443 --> 36:57.712
- Well, where did he get theibbons?
- Trash.

36:57.822 --> 37:00.200
The killer must have picked
them out of McGee's Dumpster.

37:00.418 --> 37:03.302
Means he had access o
all my notes and my ideas.

37:03.411 --> 37:06.240
Which means the murdersmay
not be based on just the book.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.042
All these pages are a
product of my free writing.

37:09.177 --> 37:10.987
- Free writing?
- I'll explain it later.

37:11.097 --> 37:13.472
And one of my many possible
endings involved Cameron Meyer

37:13.592 --> 37:15.493
and Jared Brenner killing me...

37:15.517 --> 37:18.918
Agent McGregor. It's a
character I based on myself.

37:19.027 --> 37:22.570
If the killer's confusing fiction
with reality, then you've got a motive.

37:22.693 --> 37:24.046
He's protecting you.

37:24.661 --> 37:27.367
He's already killed two of the
characters... who's the third?

37:28.337 --> 37:29.878
I haven't decided yet, but.

37:29.984 --> 37:33.541
Meyer and Enner are the only characters
that wanted me... McGregor... dead.

37:33.691 --> 37:35.359
Then why does he think there are three?

37:35.468 --> 37:37.940
I don't know. I decided it
would be stupid to kill McGregor.

37:38.104 --> 37:40.455
- Everyone likes him too much.
- Well, not everyone.

37:40.578 --> 37:43.014
"Forensic Specialist Amy
Sutton offered her heart

37:43.133 --> 37:44.733
"to Agent MsGregor, only to be rejected.

37:44.826 --> 37:46.981
"Using sign language,
she tells her deaf mother

37:47.097 --> 37:49.418
"that she can't live without him.

37:49.644 --> 37:51.143
He's going to have to go".

37:52.145 --> 37:54.650
Yeah, "go", as in leave the
agency. Not "go" as in go.

37:54.755 --> 37:56.874
Does the killer know that?

37:57.850 --> 37:58.926
Abby?

37:59.326 --> 38:00.830
She's not answering her cellphone.

38:00.953 --> 38:02.094
Security detail.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.629
Shift change. They just arrived
on duty outside her apartment.

38:04.653 --> 38:06.376
- She's gone.
- She's not answering

38:06.400 --> 38:08.259
- her home phone either, Gibbs.
- Send them in.

38:08.382 --> 38:09.557
Secure the apartment.

38:09.694 --> 38:12.024
No, she's not there.
Her apartment's flooded.

38:12.048 --> 38:13.909
She's staying with Sister
Rosita and the girls.

38:13.933 --> 38:15.085
Sister Rosita?

38:15.208 --> 38:16.697
From her bowling team.

38:16.823 --> 38:18.122
The bowling nuns.

38:47.145 --> 38:48.229
Hi, Amy.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.686
- Still no answer.
- Call again, McGee.

38:52.856 --> 38:54.216
I can't believe I let this happen.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.157
Abby knows how to take
care of herself, McGee.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.380
And she's got a crew of
nuns watching herback.

38:58.489 --> 39:01.430
Nuns are on a spiritual
retreat. She's on her own.

39:03.625 --> 39:06.441
Are you... here to see someone?

39:08.505 --> 39:11.334
I'm... because the
sisters, they're gone...

39:11.744 --> 39:13.329
for a minute.

39:14.150 --> 39:17.499
They went to the church and
they shod be back any time.

39:17.829 --> 39:19.232
If you were smart...

39:21.683 --> 39:23.919
you would've just let him go, Amy.

39:26.259 --> 39:27.462
My name's Abby.

39:29.102 --> 39:31.026
I know rejection is hard.

39:32.286 --> 39:36.074
But let's face it, you're not
good enough for him anyway.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.379
Good enough for who?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.454
Special Agent McGregor.

39:48.468 --> 39:51.476
You two take the back.
McGee, you're with me.

39:52.623 --> 39:57.227
I'm sure there's some sort
of communication problem here.

39:57.356 --> 39:59.374
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

40:03.212 --> 40:04.715
I know what you said.

40:05.221 --> 40:07.025
That makes one of us.

40:08.501 --> 40:10.381
How were you planning to do it?

40:10.879 --> 40:11.994
Do what?

40:12.492 --> 40:13.685
Kill him.

40:14.762 --> 40:15.855
Was it poison?

40:16.251 --> 40:18.253
I bet with your forensic traing,

40:18.493 --> 40:21.450
I bet you could come up
with something pretty...

40:23.186 --> 40:24.488
I wouldn't do that.

40:33.221 --> 40:34.496
I will say

40:35.477 --> 40:37.785
I've always respected your courage, Amy.

40:39.823 --> 40:41.313
Drop your weapon!

40:42.093 --> 40:44.006
He said drop it! Now!

40:44.908 --> 40:46.330
Officer Lisa...

40:46.521 --> 40:48.024
Agent Tommy.

40:51.130 --> 40:52.961
I'm afraid I can't do that.

40:53.631 --> 40:54.980
You don't know it yet,

40:55.326 --> 40:57.343
but your partner's in danger.

40:59.708 --> 41:00.925
Landon?

41:03.043 --> 41:04.423
Landon, what are you doing?

41:04.532 --> 41:05.612
I'm protecting you.

41:06.408 --> 41:08.212
McGee, who is this guy?

41:08.431 --> 41:09.498
He's a friend.

41:10.139 --> 41:11.310
Don't!

41:13.392 --> 41:14.636
I have to do this!

41:15.182 --> 41:17.251
Landon, she's not going to hurt me.

41:19.392 --> 41:20.425
It's just a book.

41:20.449 --> 41:22.212
- It's not...
- Finished yet.

41:25.998 --> 41:28.513
Tell him the ending, Agent McGregor.

41:30.139 --> 41:31.889
Tell him what happens.

41:40.473 --> 41:41.959
It's not what you think.

41:42.328 --> 41:43.375
Landon...

41:46.099 --> 41:47.835
Amy and I...

41:51.006 --> 41:52.660
Amy and I get married.

41:56.728 --> 41:59.461
You... you marry her?

42:00.008 --> 42:02.359
Yeah, I do.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.065
That means that if you kill her,

42:04.089 --> 42:06.783
you're killing the
only woman I ever loved.

42:09.158 --> 42:11.386
Landon, I really do love her.

42:11.979 --> 42:14.794
It just took me a
while to figure it out.

42:35.226 --> 42:36.689
I was only trying to help.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.495
You killed two people.

42:38.823 --> 42:40.094
I had no choice.

42:42.786 --> 42:44.139
They set a wedding date yet?

42:44.249 --> 42:46.502
The guest list is full, budy.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.023
You okay, Abs?

42:49.126 --> 42:50.621
With the amount of bad guys after me,

42:50.741 --> 42:52.654
I feel like I'm dating Spiderman.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.390
Abby, I'm so sorry.

42:54.499 --> 42:55.565
We need to talk.

43:00.377 --> 43:01.697
Look I know this is all my fault.

43:01.785 --> 43:05.230
Agent McGregor cannot
marry Amy in the end.

43:05.698 --> 43:08.663
McGee, they're all wrong for each other.
