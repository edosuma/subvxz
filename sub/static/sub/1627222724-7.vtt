-[narrator] Previously on Hit & Run:
-[Segev] Wexler lured me to the airport.

00:09.208 --> 00:11.291
-Tell him I wanna meet him.
-Where?

00:11.375 --> 00:12.666
Get to Israel.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.291
I'm not going alone.

00:14.375 --> 00:17.625
[Naomi] Meeting's at 6 p.m.,
Brooklyn Museum.

00:17.708 --> 00:19.125
What's wrong, Tali?

00:19.208 --> 00:21.750
You're not here, you're there.
You left on some crazy manhunt.

00:21.833 --> 00:24.250
Segev, I lost my job today. I can't help!

00:24.333 --> 00:26.791
-Where's Segev?
-[shouts]

00:26.875 --> 00:28.375
[Segev] Hold that shit.

00:28.458 --> 00:31.125
Just hold that shit.
I'll take you to Israel, man.

00:31.208 --> 00:33.083
Did the CIA kill Sophie Dreyer?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.166
Who's Sophie Dreyer?

00:35.666 --> 00:36.958
Who sent you?

00:37.041 --> 00:40.083
You piece of shit.
You messed with the wrong guy.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.083
Shira, call me the second
you get this message.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.750
It's urgent. Okay?

[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

03:16.875 --> 03:18.000
It's $129.60.

[bell chimes]

03:29.958 --> 03:33.583
Hey, Thomas, you guys get
those weird yogurt-y drinks back in?

03:33.666 --> 03:35.791
Ah, yeah. Third shelf down.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.166
This should cover it, right?

03:55.541 --> 03:57.833
Yeah, that should cover it.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.291
Thanks.

[bell chimes]

04:28.166 --> 04:29.625
[ringing]

04:35.000 --> 04:35.958
Hello?

04:36.041 --> 04:39.083
Shira, it's me. You need to take Ella
and go someplace safe.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.041
Segev, what are you saying?

04:41.125 --> 04:43.583
I can't explain right now.
Things here have changed.

04:43.666 --> 04:44.791
Again with this shit?

04:44.875 --> 04:46.958
You just told Tali she could go.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.250
All right, Segev, I gotta leave.
Got things to do.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.083
Listen, something awful happened.

04:54.666 --> 04:55.500
What?

04:55.583 --> 04:57.666
I can't get into it right now,
but you have to leave.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.333
Segev, if we're in danger,
I'm calling the police.

05:00.416 --> 05:03.125
Shira, you can't do that
because I don't trust them.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.000
And where should we go?

05:05.083 --> 05:08.250
No idea. Go somewhere brand-new,
somewhere you feel safe in, okay?

05:08.333 --> 05:10.000
And don't tell anyone where you are, okay?

05:10.083 --> 05:13.666
No. I can't just pick everything up and go
every single time--

05:13.750 --> 05:15.833
Get out of there right now!

05:38.041 --> 05:39.958
Ella, get up, honey.

05:46.833 --> 05:47.833
Sorry I'm late.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.208
Naomi?

05:52.750 --> 05:54.750
[ominous music playing]

06:00.416 --> 06:01.250
Nay?

06:25.458 --> 06:27.375
Sorry, I don't know what to say.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.166
-What do you expect me to do, forgive you?
-No.

06:38.916 --> 06:40.458
I just wanted you to know.

06:42.625 --> 06:43.833
If you really cared,

06:43.916 --> 06:48.000
you wouldn't have gotten him involved
in your shit in the first place.

06:49.625 --> 06:50.791
Get the fuck out.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.166
[pensive music playing]

07:56.916 --> 07:58.541
Where have you been?

07:58.625 --> 08:01.708
I was waiting at the museum
for hours with Wexler.

08:01.791 --> 08:02.666
We had him.

08:04.083 --> 08:04.916
What happened?

08:07.541 --> 08:08.791
What happened, Segev?

08:10.458 --> 08:11.750
[door unlocks]

08:21.708 --> 08:23.500
I had to just leave him there.

08:26.541 --> 08:28.666
My best friend died because of me.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.916
Are you sure it was the Mossad?

08:34.291 --> 08:35.291
He spoke Hebrew.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.708
The serial number on his gun
was stamped out.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.750
You need to stay away from me.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.250
You don't get to tell me what to do.

08:48.916 --> 08:52.458
Mossad tracked my phone
because I left it on for 30 minutes.

08:52.541 --> 08:54.791
It took them 30 minutes
to find me and kill Ron.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.666
That's how dangerous it is.

08:56.750 --> 08:57.750
I disabled it.

08:57.833 --> 09:01.083
As soon as I left the meeting,
just in case they tried to trace it.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.458
I know what I'm doing.

09:05.541 --> 09:07.083
Whatever's making them do this,

09:07.166 --> 09:10.375
the Mossad, the CIA, it's important.
People need to know what happened.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.083
This is not some story
about Hillary Clinton.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.125
They'll kill you.

09:16.916 --> 09:19.458
-You have to leave.
-No. What are you doing?

09:19.541 --> 09:21.166
Go, just go.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.166
Leave.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.625
You know what happens if I go?

09:23.708 --> 09:27.083
They hunt you down and kill you,
and no one knows why.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.083
I can protect you.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.541
I'm not gonna leave you alone in this.
I won't do it.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.916
[dramatic music playing]

09:48.500 --> 09:49.500
I'm sorry.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.208
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.541
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.666
Me too.

10:05.041 --> 10:08.166
I'm gonna go by the office...
in the morning.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.583
The magazine has
some company cell phones I can use.

10:10.666 --> 10:13.083
I'll reach out as soon as I can.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
[door opens]

10:19.583 --> 10:20.583
[door closes]

10:47.000 --> 10:48.083
Good morning.

10:48.750 --> 10:49.916
Good morning.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.125
Is that my laptop?

10:51.750 --> 10:53.750
The doctor said I should make you happy.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.583
And I remember you love Shakshuka,
so I was looking up a good recipe.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.125
[Tali sighs]

11:01.583 --> 11:04.541
Wow, it's been years
since I've slept past 6.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.500
Well, there you go.
How do you feel about it?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.416
-Very lazy.
-The food's almost ready.

11:12.166 --> 11:15.708
I think you need to get used to it.
This break will do you good.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.666
-Yeah, right.
-How's the baby?

11:19.916 --> 11:22.333
Fine. No cramping this morning.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.125
I actually feel really good.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.458
That's great.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.541
Shakshuka?

11:28.916 --> 11:29.833
Mm-hm.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.291
You want to drink something?

11:42.875 --> 11:44.791
I can't believe I got suspended.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.791
-What am I going to do?
-You'll figure something out, I'm sure.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.458
Yeah, right.
Who will hire a pregnant woman?

11:53.625 --> 11:56.041
Ugh. I am so mad at Segev.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.625
So tell him that.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.500
Tell him to stop using you.

12:01.458 --> 12:04.416
Don't hold it inside.
It's not good, for both of you.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.375
Yeah.

12:07.625 --> 12:09.000
[cell phone ringing]

12:14.375 --> 12:15.250
Hello?

12:15.333 --> 12:16.208
[Assaf] Tali Shapira?

12:17.208 --> 12:19.375
-[whispering] Segev?
-Yeah. Who is this?

12:19.458 --> 12:23.208
Assaf Talmor.
You called me about Danielle Azulai.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.291
[dramatic music playing]

12:26.416 --> 12:27.250
Yes.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.125
Hang on, please.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.000
-The food's almost ready.
-I'll be right back.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.250
What do you want?

12:33.333 --> 12:35.083
Me? You're the one who called.

12:35.666 --> 12:37.708
I thought you were investigating
Danielle's death, no?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.500
Police are. I'm off the case.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.416
Why's that?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.041
I was reassigned.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.083
That doesn't matter.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.166
If you still want to know
what happened to Danielle,

12:48.250 --> 12:50.541
I think you and I can help each other.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.291
[indistinct chatter]

13:06.875 --> 13:07.958
Thanks for coming.

13:09.791 --> 13:12.708
So, what did you find out?
What did Segev find in New York?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.208
Why do you think he's in New York?

13:18.458 --> 13:19.291
Listen,

13:20.333 --> 13:22.416
you're the one who wanted to meet, right?

13:23.041 --> 13:26.541
I don't think I will tell you anything
before you answer some questions.

13:31.666 --> 13:34.041
Let's start with why you talked
to Shaul Mandel.

13:42.791 --> 13:46.208
I was special intelligence liaison,
that's for start.

13:47.416 --> 13:49.500
One of our sources revealed that Mandel

13:49.583 --> 13:51.958
was leaking sensitive info
to foreign press.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.000
And my job often, um...

13:56.041 --> 13:58.041
was to convince them not to go with it.

13:59.958 --> 14:00.791
Was?

14:01.416 --> 14:02.750
So not anymore?

14:04.458 --> 14:05.791
I was also reassigned.

14:07.666 --> 14:10.250
Tell me, did Segev make contact
with the CIA?

14:10.333 --> 14:12.166
Wait. I'm not finished.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.208
I still don't get how Danielle
and Mendel are connected.

14:16.541 --> 14:19.125
I met Danielle a few months
after I spoke to Mandel.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.000
I think she found me through an article.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.833
Why was she looking for you?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.333
I guess the article sparked her interest.

14:27.791 --> 14:30.166
She found out
I was the one who shut it down.

14:30.833 --> 14:32.958
Which meant I had access to, uh...

14:34.750 --> 14:36.250
So she made her move.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.958
How many years has it been
since you dated Danielle?

14:41.208 --> 14:42.291
It's been weeks.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.916
Danielle and I had an ongoing,
uh, relationship.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.291
[dramatic music playing]

14:51.375 --> 14:53.666
That happened
so she could get information.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.458
I'll ask again, what information?

14:57.166 --> 15:01.166
I'm not sure, but I think it had to do
with our secret surveillance of Americans.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.208
We were spying on Americans? Why?

15:06.250 --> 15:09.458
So why you reach out
and tell me all of this now?

15:12.125 --> 15:13.875
If I found out what Danielle knew,

15:13.958 --> 15:15.916
I can use it to stay out of prison.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.708
[indistinct chatter]

15:35.833 --> 15:36.916
That your guy?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.083
Ron Harel?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.541
Used to be. You know what happened?

15:44.625 --> 15:46.666
[woman] I was starting
to piece it together.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.708
Looks like Harel was killed
inside the car.

15:48.791 --> 15:52.041
Gunshot wound to the arm,
nicked an artery, bled out.

15:52.625 --> 15:53.833
Now, this other guy,

15:54.375 --> 15:56.125
someone had fun with him.

15:56.708 --> 16:00.708
Turned his face into meat,
broke every one of his fingers.

16:00.791 --> 16:04.833
But he has no ID.
Not even a piece of lint in his pockets.

16:04.916 --> 16:08.166
What's even crazier is
he's wearing heavy tactical gear.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.500
-Tactical gear?
-Yeah.

16:09.583 --> 16:10.583
As in military?

16:11.208 --> 16:12.833
[woman] Could be. Or special ops.

16:12.916 --> 16:15.875
-Prints?
-No, no. The place is a mess.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.416
Somebody wiped down the car.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.416
-Killer knew what they were doing.
-Yep.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.166
-Any video?
-Also no.

16:21.250 --> 16:26.166
But the workers did see somebody leaving
the junkyard before they called it in.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.333
-What'd he look like?
-Mm.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.208
Caucasian, medium height, shaved head.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.000
-Excuse me.
-Wait, what?

16:34.083 --> 16:35.583
-Excuse me.
-You know him?

16:45.083 --> 16:46.250
[cell phone ringing]

16:48.500 --> 16:50.750
-Tali, it's you?
-[Tali] Mm-hm.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.125
Did you get my message? I was worried.

16:53.208 --> 16:56.041
I'm fine. Don't worry.
That's not why I called.

16:57.125 --> 17:00.291
-Assaf Talmor reached out to me.
-Who, the obsessed guy?

17:00.375 --> 17:02.083
He's not who we thought he was.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.000
He used to work for the NSC.

17:04.833 --> 17:05.833
What?

17:05.916 --> 17:08.250
A few weeks ago,
there was a security breach.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.375
Someone stole classified intel from them.

17:10.458 --> 17:11.458
What intel?

17:12.416 --> 17:16.041
I still don't know, but it has to do
with tracking of American targets.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.458
The one who stole it was Danielle.

17:18.541 --> 17:21.416
She used Assaf to get to it.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.666
That's probably why they wanted to,
you know, get rid of her.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.583
[dramatic music playing]

17:30.166 --> 17:31.541
Segev, are you there?

17:33.625 --> 17:35.708
She slept with him
while we were together, huh?

17:39.041 --> 17:40.041
Does it matter now?

17:43.625 --> 17:44.625
Anything else?

17:45.666 --> 17:49.000
He thinks that the intel she took
is still out there,

17:49.083 --> 17:50.625
hidden somewhere...

17:51.875 --> 17:52.958
and that you have it.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.208
[suspenseful music playing]

19:33.458 --> 19:34.625
What are you doing?

19:35.333 --> 19:36.750
Dance notation.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.833
Choreographers use it to write down dance.

19:39.916 --> 19:42.833
The numbers and letters
correspond to body parts

19:42.916 --> 19:44.708
and different types of motion.

19:45.375 --> 19:46.375
Like a code?

19:47.583 --> 19:48.416
Sort of.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.583
Show me.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.125
-Show me how you do that.
-Okay.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.541
E-F.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.291
-E-F.
-Two-J-six.

20:00.375 --> 20:02.000
Two-J-six.

20:02.083 --> 20:02.916
E-F.

20:03.958 --> 20:05.625
-I can do that.
-Oh?

20:05.708 --> 20:07.000
-Huh?
-Okay.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.541
-I...
-Oh, my God.

20:10.875 --> 20:11.708
...want...

20:11.791 --> 20:12.833
Mmm.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.125
...you...

20:15.333 --> 20:16.166
now.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.125
[Danielle] Okay! [chuckles]

20:20.666 --> 20:22.083
[both] Yallah.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.291
[dramatic music playing]

21:00.333 --> 21:01.250
Where were you?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.333
I was worried.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.416
Sorry, I couldn't answer my phone.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.000
For six hours?

21:12.041 --> 21:13.791
I turned it off as a precaution.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.291
It might be tapped.
I didn't want to be followed.

21:16.833 --> 21:17.666
Followed?

21:19.208 --> 21:21.916
-Don't worry, it's fine.
-It's fine? Your phone is tapped.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.958
It might be tapped.
Don't worry. It's fine.

21:25.625 --> 21:26.958
Babe, you--

21:27.041 --> 21:29.666
You disappear for hours
and you don't call?

21:29.750 --> 21:33.666
You won't tell me what
this Pulitzer-worthy story is really about

21:33.750 --> 21:36.500
except that it involves
your ex-boyfriend's wife, some kind--

21:36.583 --> 21:39.500
Jesus! Enough, Henry. Enough!

21:39.583 --> 21:42.208
I don't grill you about your cases.

21:42.291 --> 21:45.041
-You represent actual criminals.
-Not the same.

21:45.125 --> 21:49.041
If I say I'm safe, that it's okay,
that should be enough.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.583
-Sorry for caring.
-After ten years of doing this,

21:51.666 --> 21:53.375
I thought you got it already.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.125
Just let me do my goddamn job!

21:56.750 --> 21:58.875
God knows I let you do yours.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.916
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.041
What is the hold
that this fucking guy has over you?

22:08.125 --> 22:10.125
There is no hold. This is work.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.250
It was what, a year you were together?

22:15.333 --> 22:16.416
Not even.

22:16.958 --> 22:20.000
I went back to school
and he went back to his life.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.000
-It was over.
-I gotta be honest.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.625
It's really hard
to imagine you with that guy.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.125
[scoffs]

22:27.666 --> 22:32.208
Like it was really hard to imagine you
with that pharmaceutical saleswoman?

22:32.291 --> 22:35.041
-Charlene, whatever her name was.
-Charlotte.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.500
Charlotte.

22:36.583 --> 22:40.208
Whatever, she could barely read.
And you were with her for two years.

22:40.916 --> 22:42.625
We've all had our moments.

22:44.625 --> 22:45.625
I guess.

22:49.958 --> 22:50.958
I'm fine.

22:53.708 --> 22:54.833
I promise.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.625
I have some work to do.

23:04.291 --> 23:07.166
-Gonna make some tea. You want some?
-Nope.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.083
[ominous music playing]

24:15.250 --> 24:19.958
No match on the prints from the other body
at the junkyard, but I do have news.

24:20.791 --> 24:21.625
Do tell.

24:21.708 --> 24:24.250
Got the traffic cam footage
from a few nights ago.

24:24.333 --> 24:28.375
From a tollbooth on 495 heading east,
the van you were looking for.

24:30.416 --> 24:32.958
Harel's driving,
but look who's next to him.

24:33.458 --> 24:36.375
Matches the description
the workers at the junkyard gave.

24:36.458 --> 24:39.333
Hmph. The guy witnesses ID'd
at the nightclub.

24:39.416 --> 24:40.833
Fuck, yeah. Right?

24:41.791 --> 24:42.958
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.375
Put a BOLO out to every cop
in the New York metro.

24:46.458 --> 24:47.291
On it.

24:47.375 --> 24:49.125
He's wanted in connection
with four homicides.

24:49.208 --> 24:51.333
Anyone who finds him,
proceed with caution.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.666
-He's dangerous.
-You got it.

25:03.791 --> 25:04.750
Et le fin.

25:06.000 --> 25:06.833
Très bien.

25:06.916 --> 25:08.250
Well done, guys.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.666
See you tomorrow, don't be late, hm?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.750
[indistinct chatter]

25:14.958 --> 25:16.666
-Hello?
-[Segev] Hi.

25:18.875 --> 25:19.708
Hi.

25:22.791 --> 25:25.125
I'll introduce myself.
My name is Ben Moshkovsky.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.416
I'm a PhD student at Columbia.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.666
What can I do for you?

25:30.291 --> 25:31.125
You're French?

25:31.625 --> 25:33.500
-Oui.
-Enchanté.

25:33.583 --> 25:34.541
Enchanté.

25:34.625 --> 25:38.166
My thesis is about Middle Eastern art,

25:38.250 --> 25:40.541
created in times of war.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.625
Okay.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.916
I have this notebook here

25:45.541 --> 25:47.833
from a Palestinian dancer-choreographer.

25:47.916 --> 25:50.500
-Oh.
-Um, she died a few years ago,

25:50.583 --> 25:54.458
and they say
she hid some messages in her notation.

25:55.083 --> 25:57.125
Ooh. That's fascinating.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.208
It is.

25:58.291 --> 26:01.916
So I can't read it,
so I thought maybe you can help me.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.125
Of course. May I?

26:04.208 --> 26:05.166
Yeah, of course.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.708
D'accord.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.083
The repetition...

26:16.166 --> 26:17.791
-That's Gaga.
-Yeah.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.458
So far it looks pretty typical.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.916
-Just don't ask me to dance any of it.
-Oh, no.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.208
Mm-hm. Okay.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.166
Hm.

26:39.416 --> 26:41.125
-That's odd.
-What?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.083
[woman] This page is different.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.041
It uses level notation.

26:46.125 --> 26:47.250
Why is it different?

26:47.916 --> 26:51.875
Because it's an old form of notation.
I have a book that I can show you.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.083
Very few people use it anymore.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.833
Plus, some of the symbols
are written sideways.

26:58.916 --> 27:01.708
So it could be a mistake or...?

27:01.791 --> 27:06.916
Could be. But the same symbols
are written correctly in other places.

27:07.000 --> 27:07.916
[Segev] Mm-hm.

27:18.958 --> 27:20.958
[suspenseful music playing]

28:37.750 --> 28:38.750
[man] Move, move!

28:53.000 --> 28:56.625
-No, plead out.
-No, we can't go in with that expectation.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.750
The DA's all over anything
with a narcotic.

28:58.833 --> 29:00.375
Can you give me a minute?

29:00.458 --> 29:01.291
Of course.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.125
-Hey, Nigel.
-Good to see you.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.958
Thanks for the quick turnaround.
What do you got?

29:12.041 --> 29:15.666
I did a prelim search on Segev Azulai.

29:15.750 --> 29:19.125
Forty-five, Israeli, spent about
a decade between the army

29:19.208 --> 29:22.500
and the Israeli border police
in different capacities, Yamam...

29:22.583 --> 29:23.750
Yamam, what's that?

29:23.833 --> 29:27.708
It's some badass shit.
It's like a SWAT team for terrorists.

29:27.791 --> 29:31.250
Then he worked in Mexico
doing some shady mercenary shit.

29:31.333 --> 29:35.083
Works now as a tour guide in Tel Aviv.

29:35.166 --> 29:38.666
And last week his wife was killed
in a hit-and-run accident.

29:38.750 --> 29:41.500
-Is that it?
-No, not exactly.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.708
I also tried that other name
you gave me, Ron Harel.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.250
-That dude was into some shit.
-Like what?

29:48.333 --> 29:52.500
Like turning up fucking dead
at a junkyard last night in Brooklyn.

29:53.500 --> 29:57.041
Of course, what you care about
is that he was wanted

29:57.125 --> 29:59.708
on a double homicide in Queens last week,

29:59.791 --> 30:02.750
along with
another unidentified Israeli guy.

30:02.833 --> 30:05.125
[dramatic music playing]

30:06.666 --> 30:08.708
[line ringing]

30:10.000 --> 30:12.541
-So she mailed it to herself from Israel.
-[Naomi] Mm-hm.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.916
I thought it's a note
on dances or choreography,

30:15.000 --> 30:16.458
but it's a different language.

30:16.541 --> 30:21.166
So I took it to an expert, and she marked
these symbols because they didn't fit.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.750
You think she encoded a message inside?

30:23.833 --> 30:27.041
I don't know. She mailed it
to herself a day before she died.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.000
-Look, these are the same symbols.
-Right.

30:30.083 --> 30:32.375
-And that's an A.
-Yeah.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.875
A, B, C, D, E...

30:35.958 --> 30:39.541
-Exactly 26 symbols.
-So the symbols that are sideways...

30:39.625 --> 30:41.583
Spell out a message.

30:41.666 --> 30:43.250
So let's start.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.208
Hey, hey, Henry?

30:45.291 --> 30:46.458
Naomi's not here.

30:47.541 --> 30:50.041
-Where is she? Excuse me.
-Everything okay?

30:51.125 --> 30:54.000
-I need to know where she is.
-Sorry, don't know.

30:54.083 --> 30:55.750
Haven't heard from her all day.

30:55.833 --> 30:59.333
She just came by this morning
to pick up a new cell.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.250
A new cell?

31:01.333 --> 31:04.708
We have phones kicking around
in case people need them.

31:04.791 --> 31:07.875
Like if someone doesn't wanna give out
their number to a source.

31:07.958 --> 31:10.916
What's the number?
It's a family emergency.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.916
[line ringing]

31:34.125 --> 31:34.958
Shit!

31:37.458 --> 31:39.958
There is one other thing we could try.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.833
-We have a "find my phone" feature.
-Yeah.

31:44.916 --> 31:47.000
[Naomi] "Chronos. Cheetah. Cobra. Rat."

31:47.083 --> 31:49.416
-Do these mean anything to you?
-No.

31:50.125 --> 31:53.291
Is it some government program?
Like, a secret program?

31:53.375 --> 31:55.166
Maybe Israel hacked into it.

31:55.250 --> 31:58.208
The McAfree article talks
about defense technology.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.916
Tali says Israel was electronically
spying on the U.S.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.708
And there's also this.

32:03.666 --> 32:06.291
You think she encoded messages
into all of these?

32:06.375 --> 32:07.916
It was insurance for her.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.833
She must have been sending messages
to herself for years.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.833
I don't know.

32:12.916 --> 32:14.958
I don't know anything anymore.

32:15.750 --> 32:17.500
Maybe I shouldn't have come
to this country.

32:17.583 --> 32:19.375
It was a fucking big mistake.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.583
[suspenseful music playing]

32:23.250 --> 32:25.166
Shit, the police.

32:25.250 --> 32:26.375
Go, go, go.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.416
Go. Hey, take it.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.791
Take it. Go.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.000
[door closes]

32:46.875 --> 32:49.250
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

33:03.458 --> 33:05.125
[woman] Hey! [yelps]

33:25.500 --> 33:26.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:28.333 --> 33:29.541
Get down!

33:31.250 --> 33:32.500
[crowd clamoring]

33:33.833 --> 33:36.541
-Get back, get back! Get down! Get down!
-[Taser crackling]

33:36.625 --> 33:38.500
Get back, get back!

33:42.291 --> 33:45.083
[Newkirk] Hey, hey, hey! Stay down!

33:45.166 --> 33:47.083
You son of a bitch.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.291
Don't move.

33:49.416 --> 33:51.458
Don't you fucking move.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.125
Up.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.041
Enough! Enough!

33:58.750 --> 34:02.166
[Omer] So, what'd you do
on your first day of vacation?

34:03.541 --> 34:04.625
Uh...

34:05.750 --> 34:06.916
Not much.

34:08.791 --> 34:10.916
What about you? How was your day?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.666
Insane. Didn't leave the office.

34:14.500 --> 34:18.583
Worked on some encryption software.
The deadline is unreal.

34:19.416 --> 34:20.583
[cell phone buzzing]

34:20.958 --> 34:23.083
[scoffs] I just talked about them.

34:24.125 --> 34:25.250
They don't stop.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.333
[ominous music playing]

34:29.750 --> 34:30.583
Yes?

34:31.333 --> 34:32.958
[Tamir] There's been a change in plans.

34:34.708 --> 34:35.791
What's going on?

34:38.541 --> 34:39.958
You need to bring her in.

34:42.791 --> 34:43.916
She knows too much.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.791
She's six months pregnant, you know?

34:47.916 --> 34:48.750
I know.

34:56.166 --> 34:57.000
Yes.

35:17.958 --> 35:18.958
Who was that?

35:19.041 --> 35:20.666
Tali, what's wrong with you?

35:22.291 --> 35:25.291
Omer, I know
you were digging around in my laptop.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.333
-Tali, what--?
-Who was it on the phone?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Tali, listen.

35:30.916 --> 35:32.166
You gotta trust me.

35:33.041 --> 35:36.458
You gotta trust me.
You need to come with me right now.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.625
You're a son of a bitch.

35:38.708 --> 35:42.125
No one's gonna hurt you.
No one's gonna hurt you.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.500
-We just need to talk to you.
-Mm-mm.

35:44.583 --> 35:46.375
-This is serious, Tali.
-No, no, no.

35:46.958 --> 35:48.666
We're not going anywhere.

35:49.291 --> 35:50.458
Give me your gun.

36:03.666 --> 36:04.666
[groans]

36:06.458 --> 36:08.875
Naomi, hey. God, where were you?

36:09.458 --> 36:11.666
I've been trying
to track you down all day.

36:11.750 --> 36:14.250
Segev was arrested, you need to help him.

36:14.916 --> 36:16.083
-Help him?
-Get him out.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.333
He can't stay in jail.
They can get to him in jail.

36:18.416 --> 36:20.750
-Who can get to him?
-Please, just--

36:20.833 --> 36:23.125
Doesn't anyone at the DA owe you a favor?

36:23.208 --> 36:27.000
Naomi, I don't think
that you know who Segev really is.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.750
-And you do?
-I do now.

36:32.416 --> 36:35.833
-You called the police?
-Do you know what he's being charged with?

36:35.916 --> 36:38.833
-He would have been arrested anyway.
-This is fucked up, Henry.

36:38.916 --> 36:41.291
Really fucked up. You had no right.

36:41.375 --> 36:43.125
You get so consumed with your work.

36:43.208 --> 36:45.500
-You can be reckless.
-What?

36:45.583 --> 36:48.541
I've seen it before,
like with that death penalty story.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.333
You couldn't sleep,
you stopped eating, you had nightmares.

36:51.416 --> 36:54.708
No matter how good the story is,
never put yourself in danger.

36:54.791 --> 36:57.583
It is not up to you to decide
what is worth it.

36:57.666 --> 37:01.333
You took my main source, and my friend,
and made him a sitting duck in prison.

37:01.416 --> 37:03.083
-They're gonna kill him.
-Who is?

37:03.166 --> 37:04.291
But you feel better.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.916
-So good work.
-Naomi.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.833
-You should have trusted me.
-Nay, come on--

37:10.916 --> 37:12.083
Two burners.

37:14.791 --> 37:16.041
Passport.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.791
Two-forty in cash.

37:20.625 --> 37:22.250
