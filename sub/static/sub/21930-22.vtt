WEBVTT

00:04.137 --> 00:05.870
What-what are you doing?

00:05.872 --> 00:08.740
The light is red
so I came to a stop.

00:08.742 --> 00:12.243
You're in a stolen cop car
with a dead hooker in the trunk.

00:12.245 --> 00:15.280
You don't have to
obey traffic laws.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.916
I know I don't have to.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.485
The fun is choosing to.

00:21.621 --> 00:25.156
Hey. Missed you guys
at the faculty mixer.

00:25.158 --> 00:28.560
Ah, you should have been there;
dessert was bananas.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.829
Sorry, that was misleading.
The dessert was pie,

00:30.831 --> 00:32.630
but the pie was bananas.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.732
Actually, the pie was cherry,

00:34.734 --> 00:38.403
but the taste
of the pie was... bananas.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.476
Those mixers are such
a waste of university money.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.844
If they spent less money

00:45.846 --> 00:48.413
on frivolous nonsense
and more money on science,

00:48.415 --> 00:49.681
we'd all be better off.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.549
You're a theoretical physicist.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.119
What more do you need than
an office and a whiteboard?

00:54.121 --> 00:57.255
Someday, my new formulas
on entropy decrease

00:57.257 --> 00:59.657
due to quantum decoherence
will need to be tested

00:59.659 --> 01:01.726
and that will require funding.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.728
Your theories
are pretty abstract.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.063
I wouldn't even know how to

01:05.065 --> 01:06.664
design an experiment
to prove them.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.434
Says the experimental physicist.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.571
Well, I know a place the
university can make some cuts.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.240
Bye, Leonard.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.407
KOOTHRAPPALI:
One second, one second.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.876
He's got a point.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.744
In order to corroborate
your string theory research,

01:19.746 --> 01:21.279
you'd have to create
a black hole.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.014
Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?

01:23.016 --> 01:28.286
Perhaps, but we'd all go to
the grave knowing I was right.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.255
I guess you could create

01:30.257 --> 01:32.690
a contained
microscopic black hole.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.994
Huh. Interesting.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.263
Welcome back, Leonard.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.432
Sorry, you're out.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.433
What did I do?

01:42.435 --> 01:43.052
Exactly.

02:10.934 --> 02:13.268
Ooh, this one's pretty.

02:13.270 --> 02:15.036
Mm. My mother
wouldn't approve;

02:15.038 --> 02:17.605
shows too much clavicle.

02:17.607 --> 02:20.375
She calls it
"the bosom's welcome mat."

02:20.377 --> 02:22.210
I can't wait to get drunk

02:22.212 --> 02:25.046
and pick a fight with
her at your wedding.

02:25.048 --> 02:28.416
It's just so hard to tell
what will look good on me.

02:28.418 --> 02:30.218
No. This is just
to give you ideas.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.387
You know, do-do you want
something simple and elegant?

02:32.389 --> 02:33.788
I mean, do you
want a train?

02:33.790 --> 02:36.925
Ooh, we're talking about trains.

02:36.927 --> 02:38.760
Not the kind
of trains you like.

02:38.762 --> 02:41.296
Oh, I like all kinds of
trains-- steam, diesel,

02:41.298 --> 02:43.231
coal, elevated, bullet.

02:43.233 --> 02:45.767
I defy you to name a train
that I don't like.

02:45.769 --> 02:47.602
The kind on the back
of a wedding dress?

02:47.604 --> 02:50.605
I did not see that coming.
Good job.

02:51.742 --> 02:53.608
But while we're on the subject
of fashion,

02:53.610 --> 02:55.910
I'm asking the university
for some funding tomorrow.

02:55.912 --> 02:57.312
What should I wear?

02:57.314 --> 02:59.547
Mm. Well, I've got a push-up bra
I can loan you

02:59.549 --> 03:01.549
that always gets me free drinks.

03:02.352 --> 03:04.018
How much money are you
asking for?

03:04.020 --> 03:06.020
$500 million.

03:07.824 --> 03:09.357
Then I'd go no bra.

03:10.594 --> 03:13.061
What do you need
that kind of money for?

03:13.063 --> 03:15.730
I have figured out
an experimental design

03:15.732 --> 03:18.633
that may corroborate my latest
thinking on string theory.

03:18.635 --> 03:21.970
I just need 2,148
high-power lasers

03:21.972 --> 03:25.240
to compress 20 micrograms of
gold into a small enough volume

03:25.242 --> 03:28.042
to make a microscopic
black hole.

03:29.346 --> 03:31.279
Just nod.

03:31.281 --> 03:33.248
Mmm.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.784
Sheldon, they're not gonna give
you half a billion dollars.

03:35.786 --> 03:37.652
I mean, they won't
even give me that much

03:37.654 --> 03:41.256
and I keep promising I can make
people's brains "grow younger."

03:42.726 --> 03:43.925
Can you?

03:43.927 --> 03:46.294
(whispers):
No. Shh.

03:47.631 --> 03:50.565
But I need it. It's the only way
to settle the contradictions

03:50.567 --> 03:52.934
between gravity
and quantum mechanics.

03:52.936 --> 03:55.603
Well, it's too much money, you
can't ask for that all at once.

03:55.605 --> 03:58.440
Well, what if I ask for it
in six easy installments

03:58.442 --> 04:03.445
of $83,333,333.33?

04:03.447 --> 04:06.381
Okay. What if you asked
for $20 million?

04:06.383 --> 04:08.016
I'm sorry,
I'm trying to do science,

04:08.018 --> 04:10.985
not hire Lady Gaga
to come to my birthday.

04:12.889 --> 04:15.690
Do you even know
who Lady Gaga is?

04:15.692 --> 04:19.260
Presumably,
the wife of Lord Gaga.

04:20.997 --> 04:24.199
Sheldon, you know,
Penny's got a point.

04:24.201 --> 04:26.201
Sometimes when you want
something big from someone,

04:26.203 --> 04:29.070
you-you got to be careful not
to scare them away, you know?

04:29.072 --> 04:32.707
You got to start small
and-and build up slowly,

04:32.709 --> 04:36.578
even if it takes
eight years.

04:37.948 --> 04:41.483
Eight long years.

04:44.387 --> 04:46.654
That's oddly specific.

04:47.457 --> 04:48.957
Have you ever done that?

04:48.959 --> 04:50.859
Nope.

04:58.268 --> 05:01.135
So with this level of
high-power laser array,

05:01.137 --> 05:02.670
we would actually be able

05:02.672 --> 05:04.539
to solve the black hole
information paradox

05:04.541 --> 05:05.974
once and for all.

05:05.976 --> 05:09.143
That's impressive, and how much
funding were you looking for?

05:09.145 --> 05:10.845
$20 million.

05:10.847 --> 05:12.113
Really?

05:12.115 --> 05:14.582
You think you can build that
for $20 million?

05:14.584 --> 05:16.484
Not a chance.

05:16.486 --> 05:19.721
I'm sorry, then why are you
asking me for it?

05:19.723 --> 05:22.590
Because once you've
spent $20 million,

05:22.592 --> 05:25.527
you're much more likely
to give me an additional 50.

05:25.529 --> 05:27.662
So actually, what you're saying
is with $70 million,

05:27.664 --> 05:29.030
you can build this.

05:29.032 --> 05:31.799
I can see why you'd think that,
but no.

05:32.702 --> 05:34.435
You can't go
to the board of trustees

05:34.437 --> 05:36.771
and say you gave Sheldon Cooper
$70 million

05:36.773 --> 05:38.172
and have nothing to show for it.

05:38.174 --> 05:39.874
No. The only way
you'd be able

05:39.876 --> 05:42.110
to save face is to double down.

05:42.112 --> 05:43.378
So 140?

05:43.380 --> 05:46.180
And then double again.

05:46.182 --> 05:47.415
280?

05:47.417 --> 05:51.119
And then-- good news--
not quite double again.

05:51.121 --> 05:53.755
So, uh, what do you say?

05:53.757 --> 05:56.124
We have a deal?

05:56.126 --> 05:58.059
He said no?

05:58.061 --> 06:00.094
No. That's only
a two letter word.

06:00.096 --> 06:01.963
You're gonna have to
double down.

06:01.965 --> 06:06.668
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this sort of thing happens.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.503
Higgs had to wait
almost 50 years

06:08.505 --> 06:11.205
before they built a collider
big enough to prove his theory.

06:11.207 --> 06:12.974
50 years?

06:12.976 --> 06:15.410
But I want to play with it now.

06:15.412 --> 06:17.278
KOOTHRAPPALI: You just
have to wait for science

06:17.280 --> 06:19.614
to catch up
or technology to get cheaper.

06:19.616 --> 06:21.516
Think about, uh, DVD players--

06:21.518 --> 06:23.184
they used to cost, like,
a thousand dollars,

06:23.186 --> 06:26.955
but just the other day
I used one to smash a bug.

06:28.391 --> 06:30.425
Yeah, you-you just have
to be patient.

06:30.427 --> 06:32.293
But what if
while I'm being patient,

06:32.295 --> 06:34.195
someone more relentless than me

06:34.197 --> 06:36.764
badgers their university
into giving them money?

06:36.766 --> 06:38.666
If there's someone
more relentless than you,

06:38.668 --> 06:40.301
I'd like to meet them.

06:41.504 --> 06:43.838
I would not.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.375
I'm not waiting for the
university to come around.

06:47.377 --> 06:49.777
I'll find another way
to raise the money.

06:49.779 --> 06:51.846
Ooh, if it's one of those booths
where we can throw a pie at you,

06:51.848 --> 06:53.781
I'm in for, like, 20 bucks.

06:54.884 --> 06:57.151
40 bucks if I can throw
a DVD player.

07:00.857 --> 07:03.024
Would you like some champagne?

07:03.026 --> 07:04.058
Oh, thank you.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.426
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:05.428 --> 07:06.995
This is nice.

07:06.997 --> 07:10.498
What? Helping Amy find
a dress or day drinking?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.533
It's just nice, okay?

07:13.803 --> 07:15.703
What do you think?

07:15.705 --> 07:17.705
(gasps)
Amy, oh, my God.

07:17.707 --> 07:19.007
You look
so beautiful.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.808
I feel beautiful.

07:20.810 --> 07:22.577
And look: both clavicles.

07:22.579 --> 07:24.178
Take that, Mom.

07:25.815 --> 07:27.048
You know what they say:

07:27.050 --> 07:28.616
if you got 'em,
flaunt 'em.

07:28.618 --> 07:32.887
Is it possible that the very
first dress is <i>the</i> dress?

07:32.889 --> 07:34.088
Oh, don't be silly.

07:34.090 --> 07:36.024
You can't buy
the first dress you try on.

07:36.026 --> 07:38.359
That'd be like marrying
the first guy that you...

07:39.696 --> 07:43.731
You can't buy
the first dress you try on.

07:45.068 --> 07:47.235
Little finger
sandwiches, too.

07:47.237 --> 07:49.504
This place is amazing.
Interesting thing

07:49.506 --> 07:51.372
about finger sandwiches:
you put enough of them together,

07:51.374 --> 07:53.141
you got a sandwich.

07:54.844 --> 07:56.844
AMY: Uh, guys,
we have a problem.

07:56.846 --> 07:58.046
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

07:58.048 --> 08:01.449
I look amazing in all
of these dresses!

08:01.451 --> 08:02.784
Wow. Look at your waist.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.252
Where you been
hiding that thing?

08:04.254 --> 08:08.222
(giggles)
Bernadette, stop.

08:08.224 --> 08:10.458
Penny, you say
something nice now.

08:10.460 --> 08:13.995
Boy, you know, when Sheldon
sees you in that dress,

08:13.997 --> 08:16.030
he's gonna want to
methodically take it off,

08:16.032 --> 08:18.666
fold it up, carefully place it
in a storage box,

08:18.668 --> 08:20.868
label it, and then ravish you.

08:20.870 --> 08:23.004
Should I try on some more?

08:23.006 --> 08:24.005
Are you having fun?

08:24.007 --> 08:25.339
Am I having fun being beautiful?

08:25.341 --> 08:26.908
Of course I am!

08:26.910 --> 08:28.910
Great. Keep going.

08:29.746 --> 08:30.978
AMY:
This is it.

08:30.980 --> 08:32.780
This is the one.

08:39.621 --> 08:41.422
Do you love it?

08:42.292 --> 08:44.659
Do you?

08:44.661 --> 08:47.061
I do.

08:47.063 --> 08:49.831
Wow.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.435
Also, wow.

08:58.308 --> 08:59.674
- Hello, Leonard.
- Hi.

08:59.676 --> 09:00.975
Are you doing anything?

09:00.977 --> 09:03.211
No. I'm just sitting here
at my desk

09:03.213 --> 09:06.280
typing on my computer
for nothing.

09:06.282 --> 09:08.449
That was my guess,
but I didn't want to assume.

09:09.419 --> 09:12.787
Can you help me shoot
my Kickstarter video?

09:12.789 --> 09:14.622
Do you really think people
are gonna give you

09:14.624 --> 09:16.090
half a billion dollars?

09:16.092 --> 09:18.726
Of course not, but if I can
raise enough seed money

09:18.728 --> 09:20.728
to show that I'm serious,
I should be able

09:20.730 --> 09:22.630
to attract some major investors.

09:22.632 --> 09:26.167
And look at the cool
incentives I'm offering.

09:26.169 --> 09:29.437
"For $50,000,
I will examine your diet

09:29.439 --> 09:33.307
and create a customized
bathroom schedule."

09:34.844 --> 09:37.979
That's fitting--
50 grand down the toilet.

09:37.981 --> 09:39.480
Well, how about this?

09:39.482 --> 09:41.849
For $100,000,
I will design the flag

09:41.851 --> 09:43.618
of your house or apartment.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.620
And for $1 million,

09:45.622 --> 09:49.357
I will come over and tell you
what's wrong with you.

09:49.359 --> 09:54.428
Aw, and all these years,
I've been getting that for free.

09:54.430 --> 09:56.731
Don't be smug, Leonard.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.866
That's one of the things
that's wrong with you.

10:01.538 --> 10:03.371
Well, that was
a successful trip.

10:03.373 --> 10:04.705
Yes.

10:04.707 --> 10:06.774
Amy found a dress
that she liked.

10:06.776 --> 10:08.643
She sure did.

10:08.645 --> 10:11.078
She found

10:11.080 --> 10:13.247
a dress that looked like...

10:13.249 --> 10:15.850
like it made her happy.

10:15.852 --> 10:18.052
She-she did look happy.

10:18.054 --> 10:21.589
I mean, her face was
just glowing, so...

10:21.591 --> 10:23.491
Yeah, we should make sure
the photographer knows

10:23.493 --> 10:25.660
to just really...
get in there.

10:25.662 --> 10:27.228
Mm.

10:29.065 --> 10:30.932
So we agree it's awful?

10:30.934 --> 10:34.669
That dress should be
set on fire!

10:34.671 --> 10:36.637
Should we say something?

10:36.639 --> 10:38.072
No, we can't.

10:38.074 --> 10:39.841
But don't you think
she brought us with her

10:39.843 --> 10:41.309
'cause she wants
our honest opinion?

10:41.311 --> 10:43.811
No one wants that.

10:43.813 --> 10:45.179
I do.

10:45.181 --> 10:48.149
No, ya don't.

10:48.151 --> 10:49.717
I don't want her
to look back

10:49.719 --> 10:51.619
and think she made
some awful mistake.

10:51.621 --> 10:54.722
You mean like your dumb
Cookie Monster tattoo?

10:55.491 --> 10:58.092
See? Was that fun?

10:58.094 --> 10:59.961
Someone's gonna
say something.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.730
It should be us now instead
of everyone at her wedding.

11:02.732 --> 11:05.233
Okay, but as long
as we do it gently.

11:05.235 --> 11:06.834
And together.

11:06.836 --> 11:08.936
Well, what about my dress?

11:08.938 --> 11:10.304
Don't you like it?

11:11.541 --> 11:14.575
- I don't.
- It's beautiful.

11:23.536 --> 11:26.570
Hey, Stuart, I'd like
to sell some comic books.

11:26.572 --> 11:28.906
Oh. Well, I know
all about that.

11:28.908 --> 11:31.542
Step one is flunk
out of art school.

11:32.478 --> 11:34.612
Well, why are
you selling 'em?

11:34.614 --> 11:36.480
The university is refusing
to fund my experiment,

11:36.482 --> 11:39.350
so I need to raise money
and do it on my own.

11:39.352 --> 11:40.618
Ah. How much do you need?

11:40.620 --> 11:43.888
For a start, I'm trying
to raise $500,000.

11:43.890 --> 11:47.525
Well, I hope you have
that rare <i>Superman</i>

11:47.527 --> 11:50.828
printed on the skin
of actual Superman.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.897
I know you're making a joke,

11:52.899 --> 11:55.466
but I really do have
some valuable issues in here.

11:55.468 --> 11:57.635
And this is just
the first box of many.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.236
All right, let's
see what you got.

12:01.507 --> 12:05.609
Huh. Is this a complete run
of Todd McFarlane's <i>Spawn?</i>

12:05.611 --> 12:07.444
(gasps loudly)

12:09.282 --> 12:11.715
Yes.

12:11.717 --> 12:13.584
Ooh, look at this.

12:13.586 --> 12:16.287
<i>Giant-Size X-Men</i>
number one,

12:16.289 --> 12:18.989
Len Wein's relaunch
of the franchise.

12:18.991 --> 12:21.425
Yeah. I know what it is.
I'm the one who bought it,

12:21.427 --> 12:23.093
bagged it, boarded it
and taped it shut

12:23.095 --> 12:25.196
while wearing
white cotton gloves.

12:25.198 --> 12:26.931
Okay, well, you know,

12:26.933 --> 12:29.733
I'm gonna have to open it
to assess its condition.

12:29.735 --> 12:31.602
Just be gentle.

12:31.604 --> 12:35.206
It's never felt
the touch of a man before.

12:36.309 --> 12:39.076
You don't seem like you
really want to sell these.

12:39.078 --> 12:41.445
Of course I don't want
to sell these.

12:41.447 --> 12:43.480
These are all
important to me,

12:43.482 --> 12:45.349
but not as important
as science,

12:45.351 --> 12:48.319
and if this is the sacrifice
I need to make, then so be it.

12:48.321 --> 12:51.255
Okay. Uh, why don't you
leave these here with me,

12:51.257 --> 12:52.990
and I'll-I'll price
'em out for you.

12:52.992 --> 12:55.492
Is it okay
if I stand here and watch?

12:55.494 --> 12:57.661
Sure.

12:59.966 --> 13:02.766
If anyone asks,
tell them I was brave.

13:05.738 --> 13:08.339
Hey, I can't believe you just
threw me under the bus.

13:08.341 --> 13:09.874
I know, right?
That was crazy.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.809
Well...

13:11.811 --> 13:13.244
Do you know how
that makes me look?

13:13.246 --> 13:16.547
- Uh, that's an easy one-- bad.
- Well...

13:16.549 --> 13:18.482
Why didn't you tell her that you
didn't like the dress, either?

13:18.484 --> 13:19.950
I mean, what happened
to our united front?

13:19.952 --> 13:22.686
I'm sorry. Is this your
first day being a girl?

13:30.363 --> 13:32.463
Ooh, did your mom pack
your lunch?

13:32.465 --> 13:34.565
(chuckles)
Of course not.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.767
Do you know how much it costs
to pack a tuna fish sandwich

13:36.769 --> 13:40.537
in dry ice and overnight it
from Texas?

13:40.539 --> 13:43.207
Well, I do, and my mother says
it's too expensive.

13:43.943 --> 13:45.309
I like tuna fish.

13:45.311 --> 13:48.312
Do you want it? I'll sell it
to you for $5,000.

13:48.314 --> 13:49.546
How's the fundraising going?

13:49.548 --> 13:51.540
Oh, that depends.
Raj, was that a "yes"?

13:51.564 --> 13:52.050
No.

13:52.051 --> 13:54.051
It's going badly.

13:54.053 --> 13:55.819
How much have
you raised?

13:55.821 --> 13:57.988
Well, with my
Kickstarter campaign,

13:57.990 --> 14:00.658
selling my collectibles, and
the money in my bank account,

14:00.660 --> 14:02.593
about $65,000.

14:02.595 --> 14:04.328
Wow. That's a lot.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.063
Yeah, not enough.

14:06.065 --> 14:08.465
It's so frustrating that
science should be held hostage

14:08.467 --> 14:10.034
to the almighty dollar.

14:10.036 --> 14:12.603
Well, don't give up. You'll find
that money somewhere.

14:12.605 --> 14:13.971
- You really think so?
- No,

14:13.973 --> 14:15.940
but it's good
that he has a hobby.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.908
You ever thought
of going to Vegas?

14:17.910 --> 14:20.311
Can you be more specific?

14:20.313 --> 14:23.847
<i>Las</i> Vegas?

14:23.849 --> 14:25.983
Oh, you mean gambling.
Mm.

14:25.985 --> 14:28.185
Oh. Well, that's not
the worst idea.

14:28.187 --> 14:31.021
Um, it <i>is</i> the worst idea,
and I'm including the year

14:31.023 --> 14:33.657
that Raj wore nothing
but tracksuits.

14:35.494 --> 14:37.127
Ordinary people
can't beat a casino,

14:37.129 --> 14:39.163
but mathematicians
and scientists,

14:39.165 --> 14:40.331
they do it all the time.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.966
Yeah, a group
of students

14:41.968 --> 14:45.536
from MIT took Las Vegas
for millions, and that's MIT.

14:45.538 --> 14:47.738
Howard went there.

14:48.741 --> 14:50.174
Come on, Sheldon.

14:50.176 --> 14:52.743
I'll give you a ride out
to the desert right now.

14:52.745 --> 14:54.144
No one is going to Vegas.

14:54.146 --> 14:56.814
No, we weren't
gonna make it to Vegas.

15:00.619 --> 15:02.786
Hi. Do you
have a minute?

15:02.788 --> 15:04.922
Depends. Is what
I'm wearing okay,

15:04.924 --> 15:07.358
or should I go change first?

15:07.360 --> 15:09.560
Look, I'm sorry.

15:09.562 --> 15:11.829
I never should have said
I didn't like your dress.

15:11.831 --> 15:13.430
It's your wedding,
and all that matters is

15:13.432 --> 15:14.665
that you feel beautiful.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.633
Thank you.

15:16.635 --> 15:18.635
So, are... are we good?

15:18.637 --> 15:19.703
No, we're not good.

15:19.705 --> 15:21.271
You ruined my dress.

15:21.273 --> 15:23.741
Well, why? I just said
you should wear it.

15:23.743 --> 15:26.510
Well, I can't wear it now.
I mean, I know you hate it.

15:26.512 --> 15:28.178
That's all I'm gonna
be thinking about.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.713
No, I don't hate it.

15:29.715 --> 15:32.349
I asked if you liked it,
and you said no.

15:32.351 --> 15:35.152
There is a lot of room between
"don't like" and "hate."

15:35.154 --> 15:38.522
You know, it's-it's where
you find rice pudding and jazz.

15:39.658 --> 15:41.692
Anyway, who cares
what I think?

15:41.694 --> 15:44.695
I do. You're the-the coolest,

15:44.697 --> 15:47.998
prettiest, best-dressed
person in my life.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.967
Okay, that would be
flattering,

15:49.969 --> 15:52.903
except I know
all the people in your life.

15:54.373 --> 15:55.873
Look, Amy,

15:55.875 --> 15:58.542
I don't know what to say.
I think I got stuck on the fact

15:58.544 --> 16:01.145
that it's not a dress I would
choose, but it shouldn't be.

16:01.147 --> 16:02.679
You know,
it's your dress.

16:02.681 --> 16:05.349
I mean, hey,
would you marry Leonard?

16:05.351 --> 16:06.750
Ew.

16:06.752 --> 16:11.922
Okay, a simple "no"
would have been fine, but...

16:11.924 --> 16:13.757
you see my point.

16:13.759 --> 16:15.526
That we're different people?

16:15.528 --> 16:18.128
Yes, and from now on,
I am gonna remember

16:18.130 --> 16:20.264
that this wedding
is all about you.

16:20.266 --> 16:23.067
I appreciate that.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.968
You're a good maid of honor.

16:24.970 --> 16:27.604
(ringtone plays)

16:27.606 --> 16:29.807
It's Bernadette.
Hello?

16:29.809 --> 16:32.910
I feel bad about hanging Penny
out to dry.

16:32.912 --> 16:36.046
The truth is,
I don't like the dress, either.

16:37.016 --> 16:39.049
Are you kidding me?

16:39.051 --> 16:40.951
Now Bernadette doesn't
like the dress?

16:40.953 --> 16:43.353
(whispers):
Oh, she is the worst.

16:47.259 --> 16:49.560
Anyone seen Sheldon?

16:49.562 --> 16:51.728
Last time I saw Sheldon
was this morning.

16:51.730 --> 16:55.566
Careful. Don't say his
name a third time.

16:55.568 --> 16:58.469
You don't think he actually went
to Las Vegas, do you?

16:58.471 --> 16:59.937
(roulette ball clicking)

16:59.939 --> 17:01.438
Five red.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.706
(slot machines chiming)

17:02.708 --> 17:04.842
This is it.

17:04.844 --> 17:07.144
- Is everything okay, sir?
- Oh. Hi.

17:07.146 --> 17:08.479
It's better than okay.

17:08.481 --> 17:11.080
I am a physicist, and I have
been observing this wheel

17:11.083 --> 17:14.050
for hours and running
a chi-square analysis,

17:14.053 --> 17:16.619
which is how I know that
the ball is far more likely

17:16.622 --> 17:18.789
to land on 32, 17 or five.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.358
So if you could hold off
on replacing this wheel,

17:21.359 --> 17:23.026
I'd like to make
several large bets.

17:24.630 --> 17:27.798
Well, good for you.
Pelican.

17:27.800 --> 17:28.799
What's pelican?

17:28.801 --> 17:30.701
- Sir, would you come with us?
- Oh, no.

17:30.703 --> 17:32.970
I have to place my bet first.
This is for science.

17:32.972 --> 17:37.441
- 17 black.
- No! No!

17:43.035 --> 17:45.669
Oh, guess who's no longer
allowed to set foot in...?

17:45.671 --> 17:49.073
(gasps)
Wow!

17:50.376 --> 17:52.610
You look beautiful.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.280
Really?

17:56.282 --> 17:58.449
'Cause I was gonna return it.

17:58.451 --> 18:01.051
Why would you return it?

18:01.053 --> 18:04.722
You look like a pile of swans.

18:07.660 --> 18:10.461
I'm so glad you like it...

18:10.463 --> 18:15.232
because... it's gonna be
my wedding dress.

18:15.234 --> 18:18.402
I can't wait to marry you.

18:21.474 --> 18:23.808
Why do you smell
like smoke?

18:25.645 --> 18:27.745
I was in Vegas.

18:27.747 --> 18:28.946
Vegas?

18:28.948 --> 18:32.049
I'm sorry. <i>Las</i> Vegas.
