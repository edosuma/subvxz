WEBVTT

01:12.240 --> 01:13.507
Thank you.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.979
Hello, and welcome
to The Grand Tour,

01:18.979 --> 01:21.549
which this week
comes to you from Nashville!

01:21.549 --> 01:23.217
- There it is.

01:25.486 --> 01:29.157
It was er... It's a city that
was named after General Nash.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.592
Big war hero,
kicked the British out.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.027
- He got er...

01:34.027 --> 01:37.731
You ended up with
independence. And how's
that working out for you?

01:39.367 --> 01:41.535
I only ask because we were
looking the other day

01:41.535 --> 01:44.405
at the bestselling cars
in America these days.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.440
This is the top five.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.743
There you go, that's
independence... working well.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.846
Toyota, Honda, Toyota,
Nissan, Honda.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.449
So what is actually made
in Detroit these days, then?

01:55.449 --> 02:00.788
Er... Well, mostly
they just grow sustainable
organic peace beans.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.192
- It's just women with
armpit hair growing kale.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.626
That's all
that's going on there--

02:05.626 --> 02:08.229
municipal farms
for the community.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.831
Now, the reason
we've come to Nashville

02:10.831 --> 02:12.500
is very simple, in fact.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.602
It's because I've been
to all 50 of the US states,

02:14.602 --> 02:16.270
but I'd never
been here before.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.938
And what a town!

02:17.938 --> 02:19.407
- Yeah.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.444
JAMES: Love it.
JEREMY: Who knew?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.513
- We are loving it.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.215
It is a great place,
we're loving it,

02:27.215 --> 02:28.949
and the music is amazing.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.652
- Loving that... very much.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.654
JAMES: Well...
RICHARD: What?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.489
- Not really.
- Mate, you can't...

02:35.489 --> 02:37.658
This is known as
Music City USA.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.127
- That's what it is.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.362
Because Detroit is.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.597
Oh, no. Listen... No.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.233
- JEREMY: It is.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.700
Motown... Motown

02:46.700 --> 02:49.102
is just three minutes
of jangly nonsense.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.104
- Oh, come on, Hammond!
- It is!

02:51.104 --> 02:52.606
Hammond, it just isn't!

02:52.606 --> 02:54.007
You cannot possibly say that.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.243
Country and western music

02:55.243 --> 02:56.544
is designed
to make you miserable.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.146
Motown is designed
to make you happy.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.415
No, he's absolutely right.
Motown is happier music.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.950
I mean, take something like

03:02.950 --> 03:05.152
Martha Reeves
"Dancing In The Streets", OK?

03:05.152 --> 03:06.754
Listen to how happy
the words are.

03:06.754 --> 03:10.023
"Every guy, grab a girl,
everywhere around the world."

03:10.023 --> 03:12.260
Isn't that what Donald
was telling us to do?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.333
Well, he was, wasn't he?
He did. He did.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.502
No, he said,
"Every guy, grope a girl."

03:21.502 --> 03:23.271
- A very different thing.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.506
Detroit isn't just Motown.
Bob Seger's from Detroit.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.308
It's just housewives' music.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.643
- Ted Nugent
- Mad!

03:29.643 --> 03:32.012
- Iggy Pop.
- Ridiculous.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.180
- Madonna.
- Annoying.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.848
- Eminem.
- Can't sing.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.784
- Alice Cooper.
- Ridiculous again.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.619
- Half of The Eagles.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.388
- Glenn Frey.
- I don't like that half.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.892
Nashville. Right, what's come
out of here? Miley Cyrus.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.126
Brilliant!

03:48.596 --> 03:51.031
- You just said that
out loud on television.
- I did.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.033
And...
And The Allman Brothers.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.102
- Never heard of them.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.504
JEREMY: You have.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.838
The Allman Brothers,

03:57.838 --> 03:59.640
they had that one hit,
instrumental.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.442
MAN: Jessica.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.476
- Jennifer.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.744
Oh, I hated that.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.313
You never hear it
any more, do you?

04:05.313 --> 04:06.414
JAMES: No. Rubbish.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.748
RICHARD: Weirdest thing.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.149
Weirdest thing.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.318
- Oh, hello.
- A message.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.585
Oh, sorry.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.186
This is a message
from Mr Wilman.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.388
We've gone a bit off topic.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.889
He might be cross.
We have a bit.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.991
There is a car thing here
we ought to talk about.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.728
It's called coal rolling.
Are you familiar with this?

04:21.695 --> 04:23.897
It has its origins in a sport

04:23.897 --> 04:26.700
where people go with their
pickup trucks into a field

04:26.700 --> 04:29.202
and see who can tow
the heaviest thing.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.139
- Yep. Oh, yep.
- We've got some footage
here of it happening.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.042
Look at that!
The man in a pickup truck
towing a heavy thing.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.610
RICHARD: There you go.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.646
Things you will never hear
said at that event:

04:38.646 --> 04:40.881
"Got to rush, lads. I'm
late for a poetry reading."

04:42.550 --> 04:44.184
JAMES:
That's truck number three--

04:44.184 --> 04:45.719
Bernie Sanders, everybody.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.422
Anyway, the thing is,
they worked out

04:48.422 --> 04:49.923
they could pull
more heavy things

04:49.923 --> 04:52.360
if they fiddled with the ECU
on the diesel engines,

04:52.360 --> 04:54.562
because that would
generate more power,

04:54.562 --> 04:56.597
and, as a by-product,
more smoke,

04:56.597 --> 04:58.499
cos that's why it's
called coal rolling.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.735
And now, various kids
have started to do it
out on the highway.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.704
What they do is go
out on the street

05:03.704 --> 05:05.639
and then do it when they
overtake a Toyota Prius.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.576
Look at this. Here we go.

05:08.576 --> 05:12.680
RICHARD: Oh, for God's sake!
Really?! Oh, come on!

05:12.680 --> 05:14.448
Really?!

05:14.448 --> 05:16.950
- Now, I...
- That's just...

05:16.950 --> 05:20.020
I just... I know,
I know I shouldn't say this.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.122
But every time
I overtake a Prius,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.725
I always think,
"I could do this in fourth...

05:24.725 --> 05:26.494
"but I'm gonna use
second instead

05:26.494 --> 05:28.462
to annoy them even more."

05:28.462 --> 05:31.064
You do know
you are 56 years old?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.434
- Yeah, but I've got
a mental age of nine.
- Oh, yeah.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.936
- Shall we get on with
the show?
- Yeah, it's time.

05:35.936 --> 05:39.640
On with the show.
In our car show this week...

05:41.409 --> 05:43.677
James runs over
a sun lounger.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.781
Richard has a beer.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.985
And I go on a thing.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.122
Jesus!

05:55.122 --> 05:56.457
Anyway, before all that,

05:56.457 --> 05:57.925
we've been having
a bit of a debate.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.128
You see, I say you don't
need to buy a BMW M3

06:01.128 --> 06:06.199
because for £11,000 less
you can have a Jaguar XE S,

06:06.199 --> 06:07.935
which is nicer to drive,

06:07.935 --> 06:10.337
more comfortable
and just as fast.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.072
- It isn't just as fast.
- Yes, it is.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.875
- No, it isn't.
- They both do 155mph.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.646
Yes, because the BMW
has been electronically
limited to 155.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.347
The Jag is just... limited.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.215
- Sorry to interrupt.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.884
It's just that both my
colleagues are wrong.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.754
Because if you want a small,
fast saloon car,

06:26.754 --> 06:28.255
what you absolutely
have to have--

06:28.255 --> 06:29.690
If you're gonna start going on

06:29.690 --> 06:32.259
about that Alfa Romeo
Giulia Quadrifoglio,

06:32.259 --> 06:35.796
I am gonna stab you
in the eye with this pen.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.631
- No, he's--
- A number of times.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.233
He's right. Alfa Romeo
have not made a decent car

06:40.233 --> 06:42.135
for 30 years.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.471
- Erm...
- "Erm" nothing,

06:43.471 --> 06:45.172
because we need to get
back to the point.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.474
James and I have decided

06:46.474 --> 06:48.809
it was time to sort out
this Jaguar-BMW debate

06:48.809 --> 06:52.145
with a proper old-school
road test in Scotland.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.758
Hello, and welcome to Wales,

07:04.758 --> 07:07.895
where I've come with all of
our film crews and this,

07:07.895 --> 07:14.568
the brand-new Alfa Romeo
Giulia... Quadrifoglio.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.937
I think.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.305
Whatever.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.509
Let's get on now
and see what's what.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.517
Now, for this to be
a proper Alfa Romeo,

07:29.517 --> 07:33.353
there must be...
something wrong with it.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.555
Think about it.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.524
A person
who's kind to his mother

07:36.524 --> 07:41.128
and punctual and sober and
well-dressed, he's an Audi.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.832
And nobody
wants a friend like that.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.768
If you're going to form
a relationship with a car,

07:47.768 --> 07:50.370
if you're gonna develop
a bond,

07:50.370 --> 07:52.540
it's got to have
human qualities.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.708
And if it's gonna have
human qualities,

07:54.708 --> 07:57.845
it's got to have faults.

07:57.845 --> 08:02.049
And this car, I'm delighted
to say, has a big one.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.220
I don't know quite how
they've managed this,

08:07.220 --> 08:09.389
but it's not very easy
to get out of.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.592
You've got this pillar here,
then the wheel here,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.226
and there isn't
enough of a...

08:13.226 --> 08:16.730
of a gap between the two.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.231
Hang on a minute. Hang on.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.870
How Alfa Romeo is that?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.573
They put the door in the
wrong place. It should be...

08:25.573 --> 08:27.040
It should be further back.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.710
That is brilliant.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.781
There's more, too.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.016
It's not a particularly
handsome car.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.751
The wheels are too small.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.186
And for some reason,

08:39.186 --> 08:41.288
they've chosen
to make the front

08:41.288 --> 08:42.289
look like a Wolseley.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.427
Now, in the recent past--
James is quite right--

08:47.427 --> 08:48.796
Alfas have had their faults

08:48.796 --> 08:50.998
and then no good bits
to compensate.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.500
They've just been
wrong-wheel-drive Fiats

08:53.500 --> 08:54.902
with the word "Fiat"
crossed out

08:54.902 --> 08:57.771
and "Alfa Romeo"
written in in crayon.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.940
That, though...

08:59.940 --> 09:01.909
...that's
a very different animal.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.812
This is a fabulous car,

09:38.812 --> 09:40.413
an epic car.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.515
Probably
because it's the love child

09:42.515 --> 09:46.687
of the same man who
engineered the Ferrari 458.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.965
He's given it
a carbon-fibre propshaft,

09:57.965 --> 10:00.267
a carbon-fibre roof,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.002
a carbon-fibre bonnet,

10:02.002 --> 10:04.571
a proper limited-slip
differential,

10:04.571 --> 10:08.275
telepathic steering
and a clever gearbox.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.011
But the most impressive bit
of this car

10:11.011 --> 10:15.615
is its turbocharged
2.9L V6 engine.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.588
An engine that wobbles
when you close the door.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.024
That is brilliant.
Look at that.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.928
You don't get that sort of
thing from an Audi, do you?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.797
Ferrari, which, of course,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
is part of the same company
as Alfa Romeo,

10:31.765 --> 10:33.633
is very keen to point out

10:33.633 --> 10:37.370
that this is not the engine
they use in the California

10:37.370 --> 10:39.272
with two cylinders removed.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.108
They say
it's a complete coincidence

10:41.108 --> 10:44.644
that both engines have the
same bore/stroke and V-angle.

10:44.644 --> 10:49.750
They're adamant that this is
all Alfa Romeo's own work.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.184
So, there we are.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.421
It is, then.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.728
And what work it is.

11:00.728 --> 11:05.498
You get 503 brake horsepower.

11:05.498 --> 11:10.738
That is 60 more than you get
from a BMW M3. 60!

11:14.742 --> 11:16.977
It's 175 more

11:16.977 --> 11:18.545
than you get from that Jag

11:18.545 --> 11:21.148
that James would be
droning on about now,

11:21.148 --> 11:24.785
had I not stepped in
and saved the day.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.220
And then there's
the way it revs.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.827
Ha!

11:36.429 --> 11:40.567
Most turbocharged engines are
a bit wheezy at the top end,

11:40.567 --> 11:44.037
but because
the twin-scroll turbo in this

11:44.037 --> 11:47.407
is mounted in the V
of the engine...

11:47.407 --> 11:50.210
...just like it is
in a Ferrari California,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.845
coincidentally,

11:51.845 --> 11:54.647
the rev counter
is still a blur

11:54.647 --> 11:56.083
right up to the red zone.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.370
This engine is...

12:18.806 --> 12:20.707
...it's a masterpiece.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.509
An absolute gem.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.081
So, while this may
look like a Wolseley,

12:28.081 --> 12:30.083
it certainly doesn't
go like one.

12:32.719 --> 12:38.391
It has a top speed,
in fact, of 191mph.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.595
What this car is

12:42.595 --> 12:43.997
is a Ferrari...

12:45.098 --> 12:47.434
...wearing
four-door sensi-panties.

12:49.469 --> 12:54.607
And that brings me onto
this car's party piece.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.445
At normal speeds, it's very
quiet and very civilised.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.580
And even though
it's running on wheels

13:00.580 --> 13:03.616
that appear to have come off
the bottom of a sofa,

13:03.616 --> 13:04.885
it's very comfortable,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.854
even if you push this,

13:06.854 --> 13:09.122
you put it in
bumpy-suspension mode.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.726
The only setting
I haven't yet tried

13:13.726 --> 13:15.395
is this one-- "race".

13:16.729 --> 13:18.331
But I think I should.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.499
Sadly, however,

13:19.499 --> 13:21.768
before I found somewhere
to try it out,

13:21.768 --> 13:24.604
I received a telephone call.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.979
Oh, no. What?

13:31.979 --> 13:35.382
Hammond.
- Have you got our
film crew somewhere?

13:35.382 --> 13:39.219
- Yes, I have.
- Are you using them
to film an Alfa?

13:39.219 --> 13:40.988
- Yes, I am.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.223
- Wales.
!

13:43.223 --> 13:45.392
JAMES: You can't just arrange
that we go to Scotland

13:45.392 --> 13:47.027
and then disappear
off to Wales.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.428
I didn't tell you
to go to Scotland.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.898
You decided to go
to Scotland on your own.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.901
RICHARD: We've come
all the way to Scotland

13:53.901 --> 13:55.402
to do this with
these two cars.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.338
This is the test.
You trying to shoehorn...

13:58.338 --> 14:00.307
It's wonderful there are
Alfa Romeos in the world.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.342
That's a lovely thing
that we can all...

14:02.342 --> 14:03.911
JAMES: It doesn't matter
how good you think

14:03.911 --> 14:05.712
the Alfa Romeo is.
This is a car programme.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.515
RICHARD: Concepts, dreams,
imagining things.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.051
...Scotland, with two cars
that are credible, relevant,

14:11.051 --> 14:12.920
important, work and are real.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.422
JEREMY: They were still
shouting at me as I arrived

14:15.422 --> 14:17.925
with all of the film crews
at our track.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.692
RICHARD: ...itch, that
you've managed to scratch

14:19.692 --> 14:20.928
over the last ten years.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.462
I don't know how. Why...

14:22.462 --> 14:24.531
JEREMY:
It's breaking up!

14:24.531 --> 14:26.599
Oh, I've lost you!

14:32.973 --> 14:34.975
Race mode.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.946
Here we go.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.493
In race mode, everything
is in a tensed-up state:

14:53.493 --> 14:56.863
the throttle response,
the gearbox, the steering.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.566
And the traction control
is off!

15:20.453 --> 15:22.255
This has now been transformed

15:22.255 --> 15:24.657
from something
that was brilliant...

15:24.657 --> 15:27.594
into something
that is sensational.

15:37.337 --> 15:41.574
Of course, you'd never drive
in race mode on the road,

15:41.574 --> 15:45.478
in the same way
you'd never take your
wristwatch into space.

15:45.478 --> 15:50.617
But it's nice to know that it
would still work if you did.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.320
And this does.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.155
Oh, boy, this does.

15:59.526 --> 16:03.163
I've always said you can't
be a true petrolhead

16:03.163 --> 16:06.133
until you've owned
an Alfa Romeo.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.900
And the trouble is,
I've always known

16:07.900 --> 16:09.336
there's no Alfa Romeo

16:09.336 --> 16:12.472
a true petrolhead
would actually want to buy.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.042
There is now, though.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.144
Oh, there is now.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.593
And so I decided
to do something
I've never done

16:33.593 --> 16:37.197
with any car I've ever
filmed in my entire life.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.299
I decided,
when the test was over,

16:39.299 --> 16:41.668
to go to the nearest
Alfa Romeo dealer...

16:43.070 --> 16:44.337
...and buy one.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.128
RICHARD: What?

17:11.764 --> 17:15.235
- You total cock.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.836
You stole our film.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.338
Well, not really.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.607
You didn't actually buy one,
did you?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.342
Well, no, cos I couldn't
make my mind up

17:22.342 --> 17:23.776
between that and the 4C.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.812
It was like watching an ape
return to its cage

17:25.812 --> 17:28.681
and finding there was
an apple and a banana.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.118
"Oh, I like apple,
but I like bananas.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.286
So do I want the apple
or a banana?"

17:33.286 --> 17:34.654
You would
have had both, obviously.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.189
Hammond, that car
is brilliant,

17:36.189 --> 17:37.957
and it only costs £60,000.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.527
Yeah, but honestly, Jeremy,
that doesn't mean anything.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.129
If Alfa Romeo
launched a dog turd,

17:42.129 --> 17:43.263
you'd say it was brilliant.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.031
It is! I'm not making it up!

17:45.031 --> 17:48.135
You heard it. You saw it.
It's a fantastic car.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.569
Anyway, listen,
we must find out

17:49.569 --> 17:54.441
how fast the Quadri-thingy
goes round the Eboladrome.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.842
That, of course,
means handing it over

17:55.842 --> 17:58.278
to a man who thinks
that tennis is something

17:58.278 --> 18:00.680
that was invented by Stalin.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.782
He's actually
a local boy this week,

18:02.782 --> 18:04.151
from the next state along.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.018
It's the American!

18:09.156 --> 18:10.290
There he is.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.558
And even he will enjoy

18:11.558 --> 18:13.160
this magnificent machine,

18:13.160 --> 18:14.527
I'm sure of that.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.763
And he's off
with a glorious bark

18:16.763 --> 18:19.899
and a pop
from that sensational V6.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.067
Oh, it's wet!

18:21.067 --> 18:25.472
OK. Alfa Romeo Julie Quad Bike

18:25.472 --> 18:27.174
something or another.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.210
I can't say it,
can't pronounce it.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.479
I don't really like
driving it.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.381
Oh, for God's sake!

18:35.582 --> 18:39.452
So, the tall one thinks
this is a good car.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.789
I still think he was dropped
on his head as a child.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.058
Yeah, but at least
I don't wear a cowboy hat
to weddings.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.796
Right, now,
powering majestically
into Your Name Here.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.732
This could be the single
greatest lap we'll ever see.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.267
RICHARD:
What are you on about?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.502
JEREMY: It's
beautifully balanced,

18:55.502 --> 18:56.836
hard on the power.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.638
A bit of a wobble there!
Some oversteer,

18:58.638 --> 18:59.972
but it was
designed to do that.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.508
RICHARD: No, it wasn't!

19:01.508 --> 19:03.009
JEREMY: Stop saying
things, Hammond.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.211
I'm busy.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.745
This is just a BMW

19:05.745 --> 19:07.914
for people
who like fancy coffee.

19:07.914 --> 19:11.684
No, it's a BMW for people
with taste and discernment.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.286
RICHARD:
No, it's a BMW for idiots.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.587
JEREMY: Hammond, be quiet!

19:14.587 --> 19:16.088
Look at the way it's dealing

19:16.088 --> 19:17.924
with Old Lady's House.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.592
Almost no problems at all.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.228
Now he can really turn it up

19:21.228 --> 19:22.429
for the sprint to Substation.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.664
Such power! Such pedigree!

19:24.664 --> 19:27.267
RICHARD: Such bollocks.
JEREMY: Just be quiet!

19:27.267 --> 19:29.001
Just two corners left.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.738
Glorious poise in the rain
through there.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.939
Field Of Sheep.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.275
Another master class
in suspension control.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.676
And across the line!

19:38.678 --> 19:41.481
- RICHARD:
Well, come on, then.
- Well, no...

19:41.481 --> 19:43.015
Come on. What did it do?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.817
- Time.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.253
No, it was wet,

19:46.253 --> 19:48.054
so there's no point
putting it on the board.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.689
It'll just wear
the computer out

19:49.689 --> 19:51.491
- for no reason.
- Get on with it!

19:51.491 --> 19:53.260
- We haven't got time!
- Get on with it!

19:53.260 --> 19:54.861
I'm gonna do it.
Let's look at the time.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.830
Time for Jeremy's
Alfa Quadriplogio.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.134
That's not quick, mate!
I'm sorry.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.470
JAMES: That's rubbish!

20:03.470 --> 20:05.705
In the dry,
it would have done a 1:15.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.307
- No, it wouldn't.
- Yes, it would.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.675
- No, it wouldn't.
- It would!

20:08.675 --> 20:10.377
There's no point
arguing anyway.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.211
He's got the Alfa Romeo
thing out of his system,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.180
which is good,
because it's time now

20:14.180 --> 20:15.715
for us to enjoy
a gentle stroll

20:15.715 --> 20:19.486
along the sunlit sidewalks
of Conversation Street.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.563
- That's a good one.
- I like that one.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.898
It is. Right, now...

20:34.301 --> 20:36.403
OK. And we start with this.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.538
It's the new
Alfa Romeo Stelvio.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.708
- RICHARD: For God's sake!
- This is important news.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.312
It's not important news.
It's niche news for morons.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.447
It's not!
It's a superb car,

20:47.447 --> 20:48.781
because you can have it

20:48.781 --> 20:50.650
with the same
500 horsepower engine

20:50.650 --> 20:52.519
that you get
in the Quadriplegio.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.488
And with that... with that
you get four-wheel-drive.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.824
So that one will work
in the wet, will it?

20:57.824 --> 21:00.192
Hammond,
when somebody has a baby,

21:00.192 --> 21:01.728
OK, do you go up to it and...

21:01.728 --> 21:03.396
"Oh, look at my new
baby that I've...

21:03.396 --> 21:04.964
Eurgh! It's really ugly!"

21:04.964 --> 21:06.966
Well, only if it's ugly.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.337
You see, you can't be cruel
about Alfa Romeos.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.838
- Yes, I can.
- They're trying so hard!

21:11.838 --> 21:14.574
Well, let's just move it on.
Forget the Alfa, then.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.043
Now, we should talk
about where we are,

21:17.043 --> 21:21.213
OK, Tennessee, because
this is the bestselling
vehicle in the state.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.583
- OK.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.152
Yeah, we've got a picture
of the police car.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.088
And an ambulance.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.823
- And a hearse.
- RICHARD: Yeah.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.893
I'm detecting...
detecting a theme here.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.662
The pickup truck,
I think I'm right,

21:35.662 --> 21:37.930
is very popular in this
neck of the woods, yes?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.899
I'm sure you may
be amazed to hear

21:39.899 --> 21:42.369
they really haven't
caught on at all in the UK.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.003
I mean,
almost nobody has one.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.672
You hardly see them,
which is a shame,

21:45.672 --> 21:47.407
because I love a pickup truck.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.376
JAMES: Yeah, we know.
- I like a truck.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.279
I can say that here.
I can say that here.

21:53.279 --> 21:56.516
That's fine, you can say
that, but they're not
actually very sensible.

21:56.516 --> 21:57.884
Look, mate,
that's not everything.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.786
Anyway, you drive around
in your Ferrari, OK,

21:59.786 --> 22:02.021
and happily put up with
the compromises
that that imposes.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.256
So you put up with the cost,
the inconvenience,

22:04.256 --> 22:06.793
and it's not very comfortable
because it's a fast car.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.128
Same with a pickup.
You put up with compromises:

22:09.128 --> 22:11.130
the weight, the size,
the fuel consumption...

22:11.130 --> 22:12.432
But what's the upside?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.166
It's a pickup truck!
You can use it...

22:14.166 --> 22:15.602
You can put logs in it

22:15.602 --> 22:18.405
and tow... tow trees
out of the woods with it.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.972
You could put a bear in it.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.975
Hammond, you work...
you work in the media!

22:22.975 --> 22:24.811
The only thing you have to
put in the back of a vehicle

22:24.811 --> 22:27.313
are invitations
to gala lunches.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.581
- Well...
- That's all you ever do.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.116
The problem,
actually, in Britain

22:30.116 --> 22:31.918
with a pickup truck--
I'm sorry to admit this--

22:31.918 --> 22:34.854
is that if you pulled up
at a set of traffic lights

22:34.854 --> 22:36.423
and you had your cement mixer

22:36.423 --> 22:37.857
and your chainsaw
in the back,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.992
they would be stolen
immediately.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.194
Anything left
in the open in Britain,

22:42.194 --> 22:44.731
it's like nuts at a party,
you just help yourself.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.933
- So why doesn't
that happen here?

22:46.933 --> 22:48.935
Who's got
a pickup truck here?

22:48.935 --> 22:51.303
- Holy cow!
That's unbelievable.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.706
When you go shopping
and put things in the back,

22:53.706 --> 22:55.808
why doesn't someone
just help themselves?

22:55.808 --> 22:57.544
Because they shoot them here.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.448
RICHARD: Well, there is that.

23:01.448 --> 23:05.885
There is that.
Thank you, Donald!

23:05.885 --> 23:07.854
But why... Have you ever
had anything stolen

23:07.854 --> 23:09.456
when you were at a red light?

23:09.456 --> 23:11.323
Never? Has anyone
ever had anything...?

23:11.323 --> 23:13.025
- AUDIENCE: No.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.494
I thought this was
supposed to be

23:14.494 --> 23:16.362
crime-ridden in America.

23:16.362 --> 23:17.564
Maybe people are honest.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.998
I don't know, it's possible.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.032
If I was in Britain

23:20.032 --> 23:21.501
and saw a pickup truck
with a lawnmower,

23:21.501 --> 23:22.802
"I'll have that."

23:23.970 --> 23:27.474
Now,
yesterday we went to erm...

23:27.474 --> 23:29.275
It was like a big
classic-car museum,

23:29.275 --> 23:32.211
just out of town here,
where you could also
buy the exhibits.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.581
- It's great fun.
- It was a fantastic day out.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.815
Really enjoyed ourselves
in there.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.316
I mean, it was full
of, you know,

23:37.316 --> 23:38.885
Mustangs and Camaros
and stuff.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.687
Stuff like this.
We've got a picture

23:40.687 --> 23:42.321
of this sort of thing--
'60s and '70s stuff.

23:42.321 --> 23:45.892
Now, we know that cars like
this are horrible to drive.

23:45.892 --> 23:46.893
Terrible.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.661
But they're tremendous
to look at.

23:48.661 --> 23:52.364
There was so much joy
in car design back then,

23:52.364 --> 23:54.166
and you see it
in that car there.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.569
It actually made us slightly
sad in a way, though,

23:56.569 --> 23:58.871
because as we were
leaving, we suddenly
started wondering,

23:58.871 --> 24:00.573
"Well, what are they gonna
put in that museum

24:00.573 --> 24:02.241
in 40 years' time?"

24:02.241 --> 24:03.375
- Yeah.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.544
The Nissan-bloody-Juke.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.845
- Exactly.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.580
I don't want to look
at that now.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.082
- No, exactly.
Or the Dodge Dart.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.919
Well, what child's gonna
say, "Oh, Daddy!

24:12.919 --> 24:16.322
Daddy, let's go and
look at the 40-year-old
Dart in the museum"?

24:16.322 --> 24:17.790
Nobody is!

24:17.790 --> 24:19.225
It's true that car design

24:19.225 --> 24:20.392
has become so dreary lately.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.794
And I think part of it,

24:21.794 --> 24:23.696
it's almost as if
the people who design cars

24:23.696 --> 24:25.264
don't actually like
cars that much.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.266
Exactly. But they did then.
You can tell.

24:27.266 --> 24:30.002
There was a Cuda in there
next to a Plymouth Fury,

24:30.002 --> 24:33.105
and I just stood for about an
hour, just soaking them in.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.675
I saw a 1966 Cadillac.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.276
We've got a picture
of it here. Look.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.811
Now, what I like about this

24:38.811 --> 24:40.647
is that the bloke
who designed the bonnet,

24:40.647 --> 24:42.414
he thought, "I've finished
with the bonnet.

24:42.414 --> 24:43.916
I'll do the grill."

24:43.916 --> 24:45.552
But he didn't tell
the blokes doing the wings,

24:45.552 --> 24:47.954
and they kept going, so it
goes like another foot.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.823
No, but this is fantastic
with a fantastic-looking car.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.225
The Buick Riviera, they had
one of those in there.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.661
- Look at that!
- That is glorious!

24:54.661 --> 24:55.928
I had one of those

24:55.928 --> 24:57.630
as a toy when I was little.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.298
If you put your finger
over the back window,

24:59.298 --> 25:01.033
it flashed its lights.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.569
And you just look and you go,

25:02.569 --> 25:04.871
"How can Buick have gone
from doing that

25:04.871 --> 25:06.806
"in, what, 30-40 years,
to doing this,

25:06.806 --> 25:08.174
whatever this brown..."
Look at...

25:08.174 --> 25:10.442
!

25:10.442 --> 25:12.144
And it's the same
as Chevrolet.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.380
There was an Impala
in there, 1960.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.949
RICHARD: Look at that!
That is exciting not moving!

25:16.949 --> 25:19.118
JEREMY: That's a Chevy
Impala from the '60s.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.953
Let's have a look at one
from today.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.589
- RICHARD: Oh, for God's sake!

25:22.589 --> 25:24.857
How do they even have the
nerve to call that an Impala?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.325
Because it isn't one.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.694
I was looking at a Corvette,

25:27.694 --> 25:28.895
a '70s Corvette.

25:28.895 --> 25:29.996
That's the C3 model,

25:29.996 --> 25:31.463
if you're a Corvette nerd.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.699
This was a car
that was driven

25:32.699 --> 25:34.000
by all of the astronauts.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.603
- JAMES: Exactly.
- And Dirk Diggler.

25:36.603 --> 25:37.870
- JAMES: Yep.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.606
Ah, so it's a car

25:39.606 --> 25:41.774
for porn stars
and astronauts.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.010
- What a strapline!
- What car is there today

25:44.010 --> 25:45.912
that could be driven by
porn stars and astronauts?

25:45.912 --> 25:48.114
- There isn't one.
MAN: An Alfa!

25:48.114 --> 25:50.650
An Alfa?!

25:50.650 --> 25:52.852
Actually, he's right!

25:52.852 --> 25:55.688
No, astronauts
have to get there.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.156
He's right! That's exactly

25:57.156 --> 25:59.358
- what the Quadriplegio is!
- No!

25:59.358 --> 26:02.695
For porn stars and astronauts,
which is what I am.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.063
Now, I would like to have

26:04.063 --> 26:07.299
a conversation about
the Nürburgring.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.901
- Go on.
- Because this is important.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.402
Last year, I was delighted.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.204
The people who run
the Nürburgring in Germany,

26:12.204 --> 26:15.041
they said they were gonna
ban car manufacturers

26:15.041 --> 26:17.043
from setting
lap records there.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.846
Sorry, why were you
delighted about that?

26:19.846 --> 26:21.147
Because that's
an excellent idea.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.249
If you make a car
that is excellent

26:23.249 --> 26:25.117
for doing a fast lap
of the Nürburgring,

26:25.117 --> 26:27.920
it would be useless as a car
everywhere else in your life.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.389
It's like... It's like
setting your house up

26:30.389 --> 26:31.658
to play Laser Quest.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.993
It will be brilliant
for playing Laser Quest,

26:33.993 --> 26:35.561
but it'll be rubbish
for a dinner party

26:35.561 --> 26:36.896
because it's full of lasers,

26:36.896 --> 26:38.364
darkness, fog
and music that goes...

26:39.431 --> 26:40.667
...and people running around

26:40.667 --> 26:41.834
thinking that they're
in Star Wars.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.169
Or you could get a dog...

26:43.169 --> 26:45.104
You could train a dog
as an attack dog,

26:45.104 --> 26:47.674
which is fantastic
if you own a scrapyard

26:47.674 --> 26:49.141
and you need
the dog to guard it,

26:49.141 --> 26:52.011
but take it home as a pet,
it will eat your children.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.445
- It's completely useless.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.047
That's what happens

26:55.047 --> 26:56.883
when you set a car up
for the Nürburgring.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.584
This isn't really
a conversation, James.

26:58.584 --> 27:01.220
No, I think we've
accidentally turned down
Rant Lane this week.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.689
- Well, there's more.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.856
- He's off again.
- No, no.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.358
But the thing is,
the bad news in all this

27:06.358 --> 27:07.694
is that they've decided

27:07.694 --> 27:09.561
that they will allow
car manufacturers

27:09.561 --> 27:11.230
to set lap records again.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.164
Well, that's good.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.800
- No, it's bad!
- OK.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.201
Think of the cars
that have come out recently

27:15.201 --> 27:17.003
that we've driven
that have been developed

27:17.003 --> 27:18.805
so that they would go fast
around the Nürburgring.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.707
BMW M4 GTS,

27:20.707 --> 27:22.742
you can't deny it,
it's a terrible car.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.744
Nissan GT-R,
the Track Edition,

27:24.744 --> 27:26.278
that is a terrible car.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.548
Even SEAT--
the SEAT Leon Cupra 280,

27:29.548 --> 27:32.218
that's got a hatchback
record for going around
the Nürburgring,

27:32.218 --> 27:33.619
and it's rubbish!

27:33.619 --> 27:35.454
The Nürburgring ruins cars.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.456
I'm developing an app
for the smart phone

27:37.456 --> 27:38.758
called Bomb The Nürburgring

27:38.758 --> 27:40.626
where you guide
a Dornier 17 over it

27:40.626 --> 27:42.228
and blow it up.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.096
What are you doing
on this programme?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.597
- Talking sense!

27:45.597 --> 27:47.399
RICHARD: Good question.
I don't know.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.269
We have this old woman who
has a baking show in Britain.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.771
She's called Mary Berry.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.572
It would be...
You probably know her.

27:53.572 --> 27:54.941
It's probably the same

27:54.941 --> 27:56.943
as her saying, "I hate cakes!"

27:56.943 --> 27:58.110
- Yes.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.611
Mary Berry
would agree with me,

27:59.611 --> 28:00.980
because if she made a cake

28:00.980 --> 28:02.749
that had been developed
on the Nürburgring,

28:02.749 --> 28:05.084
someone would put
fried onions on the top

28:05.084 --> 28:07.319
and completely ruin it.
You'd have a Victoria sponge

28:07.319 --> 28:09.856
with onion on the top
for no reason!

28:09.856 --> 28:11.423
James, you know
you're weird, don't you?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.325
That's not weird. That's
the most sensible thing

28:13.325 --> 28:14.961
that's ever been said
on this show.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.462
- You are weird.
- I'm not weird.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.765
He is weird! We were coming
through the airport

28:18.765 --> 28:20.166
here the other day,
coming through Chicago,

28:20.166 --> 28:22.168
and he went,
"Jeremy, smell my jacket."

28:22.168 --> 28:23.402
!

28:23.402 --> 28:24.871
- Yeah.
- He did.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.638
He said, "Smell my jacket."
I said, "Why?"

28:26.638 --> 28:29.108
He said, "Because it smells
of old record players."

28:29.108 --> 28:32.011
- Mate, that is weird.
- But it did!

28:32.011 --> 28:34.346
You know record players
don't smell of anything?

28:34.346 --> 28:35.782
They do. Old ones do.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.116
They smell of old
record players.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.885
Who knows
what they smell like?

28:38.885 --> 28:40.452
- I'd like us--
- The decaying...

28:40.452 --> 28:41.788
I'd like us to move it on

28:41.788 --> 28:43.255
because it's getting
scary now.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.791
That's not the record player!

28:44.791 --> 28:46.058
What are you on about?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.794
Does anybody have
an old record player,

28:47.794 --> 28:49.061
or anything old electrical?

28:49.061 --> 28:50.362
They smell, don't they?

28:50.362 --> 28:52.064
Has anybody ever smelled
an old record player?

28:52.064 --> 28:54.100
Really

28:54.100 --> 28:55.835
You've smelled an old...

28:55.835 --> 28:57.236
God, strewth!

28:59.371 --> 29:02.641
Did it have a wax cylinder on
it, your old record player?

29:02.641 --> 29:05.011
They smell like old plastic
and warm rubber.

29:05.011 --> 29:06.312
JAMES: Yeah, exactly.

29:06.312 --> 29:09.215
That smells like a party
at James's house.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.019
You're actually talking
to Thomas Edison there.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.456
RICHARD: In person.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.858
Well done, sir.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.459
Now, as we're told

29:20.459 --> 29:23.162
almost every day
these days, really,

29:23.162 --> 29:26.332
the world's coral reefs
are all dying.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.201
And we're told that this
is the fault of the car.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.437
Well,
since we host a car show,

29:31.437 --> 29:34.240
we thought it would be
our duty and responsibility

29:34.240 --> 29:36.108
to do something about it.

29:43.449 --> 29:47.486
Here in the Caribbean,
all appears to be well.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.521
But under
the shimmering blue sea,

29:49.521 --> 29:52.524
there's just miles
and miles of sand.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.128
It's an underwater desert.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.698
And even when
you do find a reef,

29:59.698 --> 30:02.835
most of the coral
is dead or dying.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.207
Thirty-eight years ago,

30:08.207 --> 30:10.142
the local government
sank a ship

30:10.142 --> 30:12.979
to encourage the coral
to come back.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.982
And it's working.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.484
It's already
an oasis of life.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.456
And that gave us an idea.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.593
Why use a ship as the hub
or your coral reef?

30:27.593 --> 30:30.662
Why not use cars?
There are millions of them.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.265
So that's exactly what we've
done. We've got five cars.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.201
And rather than go
through all the expense

30:35.201 --> 30:37.103
and complication
of recycling them,

30:37.103 --> 30:38.905
we've stripped them,
taken the engines out,

30:38.905 --> 30:41.373
removed the paint,
and they're ready
to go in the sea.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.409
JAMES: This really does
make perfect sense,

30:43.409 --> 30:45.244
because when the car
is in the water,

30:45.244 --> 30:46.545
it will start to corrode,

30:46.545 --> 30:47.947
and that attracts
all the things

30:47.947 --> 30:49.381
that help the coral grow.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.617
And then the car itself
just rusts away

30:51.617 --> 30:53.119
to absolutely nothing.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.887
So this one,
which started life

30:54.887 --> 30:56.122
as a pretty horrible Peugeot

30:56.122 --> 30:57.423
and was always
a terrible car,

30:57.423 --> 31:00.826
will eventually become
a beautiful coral reef.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.962
And all this happens
quite quickly.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.463
So in just a few years' time,

31:04.463 --> 31:07.099
the BBC will be able to make
a wildlife documentary

31:07.099 --> 31:08.734
just in this wheel arch.

31:08.734 --> 31:09.969
Anyway, we've got the cars.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.137
I've got a crane.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.504
All we need now is a boat,

31:12.504 --> 31:14.173
which is a job
we gave to Jeremy.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.441
That's his responsibility.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.276
He'll have overdone it,
won't he?

31:17.276 --> 31:20.046
Well, he'll have made a
statement of some sort, so...

31:20.046 --> 31:22.481
Freight ship.
Full-on freight ship.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.950
Or a tanker.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.395
Oh. He hasn't overdone it.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.330
Is that him?

31:39.731 --> 31:42.134
What is the point of that?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.270
Will you come and tie it up?

31:48.740 --> 31:51.677
JAMES: That's the worst boat
I've ever seen. That's awful!

31:51.677 --> 31:54.346
- Well, it...

31:54.346 --> 31:57.149
We gave you $5,000
to buy a boat.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.085
Boats are expensive!

31:59.085 --> 32:00.987
You didn't spend
all five grand on this.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.654
- That is not a five thou--
- Yes!

32:02.654 --> 32:04.023
I've got toothache. Be kind.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.558
Irrelevant.
That is not a $5,000 boat.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.794
- It is!
- It's barely a boat.
Look at it!

32:08.794 --> 32:11.097
It's brilliant!
You'll get a car on this.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.465
- On the back!

32:13.465 --> 32:15.401
- A man.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.769
- No, he wasn't.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.305
- No.

32:19.305 --> 32:22.041
I don't think
it can take two.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.275
Look! It's terrible!

32:23.275 --> 32:24.676
Instead of just
standing there,

32:24.676 --> 32:27.413
criticising a man
who's got toothache,

32:27.413 --> 32:31.050
why don't you go and get
a car on the crane

32:31.050 --> 32:32.351
and start loading it?

32:34.586 --> 32:39.558
Soon, our first car was ready
to be lifted onto the boat.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.128
It's just nice to be putting
something back, really.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.130
It genuinely is.
It's a little old Corsa,

32:44.130 --> 32:45.897
and it's gonna be
full of coral.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.466
Mr Coral coming,
swimming along.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.834
"Ooh, there's something
to latch on to."

32:48.834 --> 32:49.901
Then his friend comes along.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.170
His friend comes along.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.871
This is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.873
That doesn't fill me with...

32:54.873 --> 32:56.108
total confidence.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.916
JEREMY: Down a bit! Down!

33:04.916 --> 33:06.885
You'll have to...

33:06.885 --> 33:08.387
Boom out!

33:08.387 --> 33:10.122
Is that the sign for
"boom out"?

33:10.122 --> 33:12.891
JEREMY: That. Yeah, that.

33:12.891 --> 33:15.094
It's like being guided
by The Village People.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.862
It's working now. Unless--

33:16.862 --> 33:19.098
On! On!

33:19.098 --> 33:21.200
- The next danger--
- You're really helping.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.102
- I've got the guideline.
- Right, go!

33:29.775 --> 33:32.844
- JEREMY: Down a bit, James.
- Watch for the wind.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.280
Hammond,
can you swing it around?

33:34.280 --> 33:35.747
Do you want me to swing it?

33:35.747 --> 33:37.083
Yeah, try and get it...

33:37.083 --> 33:38.284
Oh, shit!

33:40.286 --> 33:41.920
JAMES: Who pulled that?

33:41.920 --> 33:45.457
We've got to save the car!
It's a reef! Save it!

33:45.457 --> 33:47.326
Oh, it's gone! It's gone!

33:47.326 --> 33:48.727
JAMES: Who pulled the...

33:48.727 --> 33:50.662
That's to release it,
you Muppet!

33:50.662 --> 33:52.698
Well, I thought
it was a guide rope.

33:52.698 --> 33:56.168
No, I steer it!
You just release it
when it's on there!

33:56.168 --> 33:57.569
He told me to steer it.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.305
He said,
"Pull the rope to steer it."

33:59.305 --> 34:01.373
This is a £400,000 crane!

34:01.373 --> 34:03.309
Why would you steer it
with a piece of string?!

34:03.309 --> 34:04.810
It's got all these
knobs and buttons.

34:04.810 --> 34:08.147
I steer it, you release it!

34:08.147 --> 34:10.116
So that's a quick release?

34:10.116 --> 34:11.483
- Yes!
- Got it.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.856
What if we just said
we only had four cars?

34:17.856 --> 34:20.326
So we've taken four cars,
removed the engines

34:20.326 --> 34:22.128
and the paint, and they're ready
to go in the sea.

34:22.128 --> 34:25.331
- We'll do that piece
to camera again.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.267
The thing is, why use a ship
as the hub of your reef?

34:28.267 --> 34:29.835
Why not use cars?
There are millions.

34:29.835 --> 34:33.272
So we've taken four cars,
removed the engines,

34:33.272 --> 34:37.209
stripped them down
and they're ready
to go in the sea.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.977
And then James...
Oh, yeah.

34:38.977 --> 34:40.512
And then... And then,

34:40.512 --> 34:42.648
this Peugeot
was no good as a car,

34:42.648 --> 34:46.152
but will be... but the coral
will just stick to it,

34:46.152 --> 34:47.819
oxidising and algae.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.155
Doesn't take very long.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.890
One day, BBC documentary,
wheel arch.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.393
Yeah, from just four cars.
That's all we had.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.328
Four cars. That's all
you need for a reef.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.063
Right, here's the boat
we've selected.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.365
It's a little bit damaged.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.968
With the release rope stowed,

35:02.968 --> 35:05.737
we managed to get
the first of our four cars

35:05.737 --> 35:09.275
onto the boat, which had
come with a broken roof.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.044
- Yeah. Oh, yes!

35:13.044 --> 35:15.314
- Yes!
- Yeah!

35:15.314 --> 35:17.949
Good! Result.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.786
And then we had to
secure it in place.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.557
I don't understand
ratchet straps.

35:25.557 --> 35:28.827
Er... There's water
coming into the boat.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.697
- No, there was some in
when I bought it.
- It's leaking.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.333
There's always a bit of water
in the bilges.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.768
It's why boats
have bilge pumps.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.470
No, it's coming in.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.207
It's not just like it's in,
it's coming in.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.542
- Well, there's none here.
- There's holes! It's leaking!

35:43.542 --> 35:47.379
Oh, shit! No, there is!
Well, attach us to the crane.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.215
RICHARD: Er...
It's gone down.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.317
It has gone...
It is going down.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.051
JEREMY: If you attach us
to the crane,

35:53.051 --> 35:54.320
it won't sink, will it?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.654
RICHARD: We're tied on.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.657
JEREMY: James, can you
just take the slack?

35:59.625 --> 36:01.493
Sadly, James misunderstood

36:01.493 --> 36:02.961
this simple instruction.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.963
- Oh, the whole thing

36:04.963 --> 36:06.232
has collapsed at the back!

36:06.232 --> 36:07.566
Oh, dear God!

36:07.566 --> 36:09.468
JEREMY: Wait! Stop!
Whoa! Whoa! What?

36:09.468 --> 36:10.936
RICHARD: It's falling over!

36:10.936 --> 36:12.538
JEREMY: James, it's falling!

36:12.538 --> 36:13.972
- Holy Mother of God!

36:13.972 --> 36:16.908
It's going down!
Abandon ship! Save yourself!

36:21.247 --> 36:22.781
Catch it, James!

36:22.781 --> 36:24.550
JEREMY: Save it!

36:24.550 --> 36:25.817
Stop!

36:25.817 --> 36:27.753
What are you doing?

36:27.753 --> 36:29.521
JEREMY: Oh, God.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.623
The French Secret Service

36:31.623 --> 36:35.261
didn't do a job
as good as this.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.895
RICHARD: I'm not talking
to any of you.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.830
No. Come on,
it was May's fault.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.266
You bought a crap boat,

36:40.266 --> 36:42.268
you put an idiot spaniel
on the crane,

36:42.268 --> 36:44.270
and, also, think
what we were gonna do

36:44.270 --> 36:45.637
for the conception
of the car.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.273
People would love the car.
They would see it

36:47.273 --> 36:50.476
as a friendly,
coral-loving thing.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.843
You're swimming
like an old woman.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.580
I don't like being
in the bloody water!

36:54.580 --> 36:59.551
Fact! I'm not comfortable!
I'm from Birmingham!

36:59.551 --> 37:01.787
Having sunk a boat
and two cars

37:01.787 --> 37:03.889
where the cruise liners
normally park,

37:03.889 --> 37:08.927
the port authorities
suggested we go away.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.630
So we took
our three remaining cars

37:11.630 --> 37:13.098
to a nearby marina,

37:13.098 --> 37:14.600
built ourselves a raft,

37:14.600 --> 37:15.967
and hired a boat

37:15.967 --> 37:17.769
which had a crane
on the front.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.542
- JEREMY: May!

37:23.542 --> 37:26.077
You're not operating
the crane.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.347
You are operating the crane.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.381
RICHARD: Yeah.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.582
I'd just like to point out

37:30.582 --> 37:32.318
that I've been
fired from a job

37:32.318 --> 37:33.485
that I was doing perfectly.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.521
- Meant that.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.856
I can't get the crane
working. Is there a switch?

37:37.856 --> 37:40.359
Don't come to me for help.
I'm rubbish at cranes.

37:40.359 --> 37:43.529
I didn't, did I

37:43.529 --> 37:46.465
Soon, we were ready
to load our first car.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.100
You're miles away!

37:49.100 --> 37:50.201
You've got to be spot-on.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.670
I can only lift it to there.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.905
This way, this way,
this way, this way.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.941
No, up, up, up.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.143
I can't... Jeremy,
you'll have to go back.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.646
I can't do it if you keep
moving the boat!

38:00.646 --> 38:03.181
If I want to go backwards,
I should go that way.

38:03.181 --> 38:05.016
JAMES: Right, this way. You've
got to... I can't move it...

38:05.016 --> 38:06.452
RICHARD: I can't go
that way! He's driving!

38:06.452 --> 38:08.620
I can't move it!

38:08.620 --> 38:10.622
Why don't we pick it...
Oh, God.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.826
RICHARD: Where are we going?!

38:14.826 --> 38:17.496
The bad things...
It's the wind!

38:17.496 --> 38:19.365
RICHARD:
Why are we over here?

38:19.365 --> 38:20.699
JEREMY: Wind!

38:20.699 --> 38:23.435
RICHARD: Here he comes!
This is it! This is it!

38:23.435 --> 38:25.471
We're coming in hot!

38:25.471 --> 38:27.072
Stop... chasing me
with the bloody crane!

38:27.072 --> 38:28.707
May, will you do something
quickly in your life?

38:28.707 --> 38:31.076
I'm going to kill him!

38:31.076 --> 38:33.779
Here we go! Yes!
Run away! Run away!

38:34.713 --> 38:36.548
JEREMY:
We have hooked the apple!

38:38.784 --> 38:40.786
JAMES: In a bit, in a bit.
JEREMY: We are good.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.389
We are so good,
it's almost incredible.

38:45.457 --> 38:46.925
Now we had our eye in...

38:49.461 --> 38:51.430
- Oh, Jesus.

38:51.430 --> 38:55.701
...loading the second car
was the work of a moment.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.769
JAMES: We're on.
RICHARD: Oh, my God! Yes.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.573
JAMES: That's it. That'll do.

39:01.573 --> 39:05.076
This is the manliest thing
I've ever done.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.813
RICHARD: I'm just gonna rest
my big balls on my crane.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.521
With our raft full,

39:15.521 --> 39:16.922
we headed out to the spot

39:16.922 --> 39:19.124
identified by
marine biologists

39:19.124 --> 39:23.194
as having the perfect depth,
current and temperature

39:23.194 --> 39:24.796
for a reef to form.

39:26.297 --> 39:27.833
Release the reef!

39:27.833 --> 39:30.135
RICHARD: Yes!
JEREMY: There it goes!

39:30.135 --> 39:32.438
- The reef is born!
- RICHARD: That's our reef!

39:32.438 --> 39:34.906
- Sink!
- Come, coral! Come!

39:34.906 --> 39:38.444
Yeah!

39:38.444 --> 39:40.546
JEREMY: Go!
RICHARD: Yes!

39:40.546 --> 39:43.449
JEREMY:
Oh, I'm pleased with that!

39:43.449 --> 39:45.617
The Peugeot 206.

39:45.617 --> 39:46.952
That is brilliant.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.490
Next, we had to anchor
the cars in place,

39:51.490 --> 39:55.694
which was a job for the only
qualified diver among us.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.763
He'd even brought
his own equipment.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.366
Right. Back a bit.

40:01.366 --> 40:02.534
Back... That's on my nose.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.035
JEREMY: Stop moaning!

40:04.035 --> 40:05.170
Ow!

40:17.182 --> 40:18.517
If he were a heart surgeon,

40:18.517 --> 40:20.185
he would turn up
with an old leather bag

40:20.185 --> 40:22.187
with a saw and hammer in it,
wouldn't he?

40:22.187 --> 40:24.289
"I'm ready to do your
operation. Here I am."

40:28.393 --> 40:31.229
It's like his old table with
his Bakelite telephone on it.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.832
- Yes.
- "Hello. Hammersmith 37 here."

40:35.567 --> 40:37.302
James's suit was so old,

40:37.302 --> 40:40.405
it didn't come with
air tanks, so, annoyingly,

40:40.405 --> 40:43.475
it was our responsibility
to keep him alive.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.879
How long
have we got to do this for?

40:47.879 --> 40:50.281
Well, for as long
as he's done there.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.918
- Honestly, I'm exhausted.
- I'm getting dizzy.

40:54.319 --> 40:55.954
We should keep going.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.023
No. Look, there's a generator.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.091
Why don't we just
connect it to the generator?

41:07.232 --> 41:08.399
Now. Now.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.101
- Yeah.
- You're an idiot.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.575
- RICHARD: Life-saving air.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.845
- Oh, there we go.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.081
On. And relax.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.133
Nearly!

42:10.495 --> 42:12.831
Come in, James.

42:12.831 --> 42:15.901
When our colleague
finally surfaced...

42:15.901 --> 42:17.903
he was very angry.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.073
That was nowhere near
the cars. Nowhere near.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.909
What was nowhere near
the cars?

42:23.909 --> 42:26.277
You might as well have
dropped me off the coast
of Los Angeles!

42:26.277 --> 42:28.647
- I couldn't even see them!
- Just stop. Stop.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.248
What do you...
What do you mean?

42:30.248 --> 42:31.917
How did you manage...
You're the boat expert,

42:31.917 --> 42:33.284
as you're forever telling us.

42:33.284 --> 42:35.086
How did you manage
to put the cars there

42:35.086 --> 42:37.823
and then move the boat
about 100 yards away?

42:37.823 --> 42:39.090
- We drifted.
- We drifted a bit.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.760
- No.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.829
- The cars are not anchored.

42:43.829 --> 42:45.130
Because when I got there,

42:45.130 --> 42:48.466
your drifting, stupid,
orange biscuit-tin boat

42:48.466 --> 42:49.735
yanked me back off it!

42:49.735 --> 42:51.102
We don't have an afternoon

42:51.102 --> 42:53.038
to just throw away
while you go paddling.

42:53.038 --> 42:55.807
You're saying... I'm gonna
have to do it, aren't I?

42:57.643 --> 43:01.747
RICHARD: Soon, James Bond
was ready to go in the water.

43:03.815 --> 43:05.984
- Yeah, you do.

43:05.984 --> 43:08.854
- You do, yeah. Yeah.
- Roger Moore,
the greengrocer.

43:08.854 --> 43:12.357
- Let go. Yes!
- Yay!

43:12.357 --> 43:15.526
RICHARD: I've just handed
Jeremy a welding iron.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.062
Oh, dear God.

43:21.733 --> 43:24.870
I'm not sure I trust Jeremy
to do welding.

43:24.870 --> 43:26.972
I wouldn't trust Jeremy

43:26.972 --> 43:30.275
to watch a YouTube guide
to welding.

43:30.275 --> 43:33.411
RICHARD: Oh!
JAMES: What's that?

43:33.411 --> 43:35.914
RICHARD: That's gone wrong.
JAMES: Jeremy?

43:35.914 --> 43:37.716
RICHARD:
Badly, horribly wrong.

43:44.089 --> 43:46.257
JAMES: Ah!

43:46.257 --> 43:48.694
- Very well.

43:48.694 --> 43:49.761
- Oh, yeah.

43:49.761 --> 43:51.162
- Yeah.

43:51.162 --> 43:52.297
That was all...

43:52.297 --> 43:53.965
They are not going
anywhere in a hurry.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.306
JEREMY:
We headed back to shore
for an agreeable dinner,

44:01.306 --> 44:04.575
happy that our important
environmental work

44:04.575 --> 44:06.812
was, at last, going well.

44:11.182 --> 44:14.986
But are the coral
starting now?

44:14.986 --> 44:16.621
- Yeah.
- So they're down there now.

44:16.621 --> 44:20.025
- A bit of coral's gonna...
- Yeah, it will have done.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.392
It's not a big coral reef,

44:21.392 --> 44:23.261
but it's the start
of a coral reef.

44:23.261 --> 44:25.263
Well done, chaps.
We have done...

44:25.263 --> 44:26.965
I don't clink glasses,
as you know,

44:26.965 --> 44:29.300
but we can raise a glass
to our success today.

44:29.300 --> 44:30.936
Yes. Well done, us.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.174
Maybe that's what
Volkswagen were doing--

44:36.174 --> 44:37.242
building a reef.

44:37.242 --> 44:39.410
That could be it.
That could be it.

44:39.410 --> 44:43.214
We're gonna pick up
our important marine biology
work later on.

44:43.214 --> 44:47.418
But now it's time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash!

44:54.659 --> 44:56.094
That doesn't get any better.

44:56.094 --> 44:57.996
That really doesn't get
any better, that sting.

44:57.996 --> 45:01.332
But anyway,
my guest tonight is from...

45:01.332 --> 45:03.068
Well, how can I describe it,
really?

45:03.068 --> 45:04.302
...the second biggest

45:04.302 --> 45:06.204
and most important
part of the world,

45:06.204 --> 45:09.775
as far as music is concerned:
the Northeast of England.

45:09.775 --> 45:11.342
- Oh, come on!

45:11.342 --> 45:12.811
Well, hello?!

45:12.811 --> 45:14.612
Mark Knopfler, Paul Rodgers,

45:14.612 --> 45:17.548
Gordon Sting, a couple of
people out of Little Mix.

45:17.548 --> 45:20.318
- Lindisfarne. Mm, lovely.
- Yes, Lindisfarne.
We'll gloss over that.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.854
But then we've also got...
...the main man.

45:22.854 --> 45:26.792
The man we have
lined up for you,
he is the lead singer

45:26.792 --> 45:29.795
of the biggest rock band
in the world, AC/DC.

45:29.795 --> 45:32.263
Ladies and gentlemen,
Brian Johnson!

45:34.099 --> 45:35.700
- There he is!
- RICHARD: There he is!

45:35.700 --> 45:37.268
There he is! Here he comes!

45:37.268 --> 45:40.005
What are we gonna
talk to him about?

45:40.005 --> 45:42.273
- Well, he's taken up
motor racing.
- Yeah.

45:42.273 --> 45:44.542
- He's got a new TV show.
- Yes, on the road.

45:44.542 --> 45:46.177
JEREMY: He's on the road.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.079
JAMES: I'm gonna talk to him
about being at the front

45:48.079 --> 45:49.815
of the world's
biggest rock band.

45:49.815 --> 45:51.817
- He's Brian Johnson.

45:51.817 --> 45:53.418
- Here he comes!
- Oh, there he is!

45:53.418 --> 45:56.321
- There he is.
- The man himself.
What a legend!

45:56.321 --> 45:58.957
I can't... I've always wanted
to meet him. I'm thrilled.

45:58.957 --> 46:00.325
- Yeah.
- That is a legend. Proper...

46:00.325 --> 46:02.260
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.628
- Oh, my...

46:05.430 --> 46:06.731
Oh, God!

46:09.367 --> 46:12.403
We killed him.
- We've killed Brian Johnson.

46:12.403 --> 46:14.539
That's...

46:14.539 --> 46:16.707
OK.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.276
Brian Johnson
has been run over

46:18.276 --> 46:21.412
by some people who think
they are playing football.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.648
But they're not.
It's not football, is it?

46:23.648 --> 46:25.050
Cos they don't use their feet.

46:25.050 --> 46:26.684
That's not football.

46:26.684 --> 46:29.254
That's just people
dressing up.

46:30.721 --> 46:32.123
- That's...
- We play football.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.092
- We play football.
- Yeah, with our feet.

46:34.092 --> 46:35.861
- We play football.

46:35.861 --> 46:37.695
- MEN: Soccer! It's soccer!
!

46:37.695 --> 46:39.564
It's not soccer!
It's football that we play!

46:39.564 --> 46:44.469
It's 6.75 billion people in
the world call it football!

46:45.570 --> 46:47.372
You can moan and shout
all you like.

46:47.372 --> 46:49.307
The fact is, we're British
and we edit this show,

46:49.307 --> 46:50.876
and you'll just get cut out.

46:50.876 --> 46:52.277
You will.

46:53.178 --> 46:54.946
This is a rugby ball!

46:54.946 --> 46:56.147
Look on the screen.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.448
They're only playing

46:57.448 --> 46:59.918
with the padding
they were born with!

46:59.918 --> 47:01.619
This is not a football!

47:01.619 --> 47:03.454
They call it football.

47:07.358 --> 47:11.596
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

47:13.932 --> 47:15.300
So...

47:15.300 --> 47:18.569
Brian Johnson
has been run over by erm...

47:18.569 --> 47:21.639
...some supremely brave
and talented footballers.

47:26.744 --> 47:28.779
Er...

47:28.779 --> 47:31.016
JAMES: Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

47:31.016 --> 47:32.783
Well, James,
he's been hammered

47:32.783 --> 47:34.219
to the thickness
of an envelope

47:34.219 --> 47:37.088
and his spine is now
a jigsaw, so that is a no.

47:37.088 --> 47:38.623
- Fine.

47:38.623 --> 47:40.926
Right, so what are we
gonna do to fill the time?

47:40.926 --> 47:41.927
I've got nothing.

47:41.927 --> 47:43.194
We could get back

47:43.194 --> 47:44.996
to our important
marine biology work.

47:44.996 --> 47:46.697
- Plan. Do it.
- Yes, let's do that.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.166
So when we left the action,

47:48.166 --> 47:50.335
erm... I'd successfully

47:50.335 --> 47:52.703
welded two cars
to the seabed,

47:52.703 --> 47:54.139
and that was good.

47:54.139 --> 47:56.942
Yeah, and we pick up
the action the next day,

47:56.942 --> 47:59.344
as we go back
to finish the job.

48:02.547 --> 48:05.016
JEREMY: On our way
to get the last car,

48:05.016 --> 48:06.384
we stopped at the reef site

48:06.384 --> 48:08.319
to make sure
everything was OK.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.489
Tom Daley!

48:18.964 --> 48:20.598
I don't like it.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.200
Oh. Oh.

48:25.303 --> 48:27.973
And after a few moments
in the water,

48:27.973 --> 48:30.775
we discovered it wasn't.

48:30.775 --> 48:33.979
Where the bloody hell
are they? There's the buoy.

48:33.979 --> 48:35.546
RICHARD:
This is the wrong place.

48:35.546 --> 48:37.248
JEREMY: Yes,
that marks the spot.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.250
They're just not here.

48:39.250 --> 48:42.420
Why did we trust you
to fix them in place?

48:42.420 --> 48:44.655
- I didn't... Listen.
- Of all people.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.591
Well, I don't understand it,

48:46.591 --> 48:48.559
cos I don't normally
make a mess of...

48:48.559 --> 48:50.595
Oh, you must have made
a good job of it.

48:50.595 --> 48:51.629
That's why they've gone!

48:51.629 --> 48:53.398
There is evidence,
or a lack of it,

48:53.398 --> 48:55.400
to suggest you can't weld.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.168
- Oh, shit.
- Maybe a shark...

48:57.168 --> 48:59.237
- Er...

48:59.237 --> 49:01.706
- Look.

49:01.706 --> 49:03.274
RICHARD: Oh, brilliant!

49:03.274 --> 49:04.875
JAMES: How the hell
did they do that, though?

49:04.875 --> 49:07.578
JEREMY: You know this current
that's whizzing us about?

49:07.578 --> 49:10.715
RICHARD: Look at them!
They're not gonna make
a reef, are they?!

49:10.715 --> 49:12.450
Well, maybe it could be

49:12.450 --> 49:14.752
like a play area
for the privileged.

49:14.752 --> 49:16.021
RICHARD: Some rusty cars?

49:16.021 --> 49:17.155
JEREMY: That doesn't
work, does it?

49:17.155 --> 49:18.389
OTHERS: No.

49:21.226 --> 49:23.361
Obviously,
we had to retrieve them,

49:23.361 --> 49:25.096
which meant moving the raft

49:25.096 --> 49:27.232
to the stern
of our crane boat.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.136
RICHARD: James,
have you untied that end?

49:31.136 --> 49:35.540
Yeah. Get ready to catch
this rope. Here we go.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.875
Pull it along a bit and get
it sort of squared up.

49:37.875 --> 49:39.544
I'll have a nice ride.

49:39.544 --> 49:42.047
RICHARD: Right.
Repositioning raft.

49:44.382 --> 49:46.284
That's a reassuring noise.

49:46.284 --> 49:50.488
RICHARD: Er... Where...
Where's that come from?

49:50.488 --> 49:51.822
James. James.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.624
- What's that doing
over there?

49:53.624 --> 49:55.060
What's what doing?

49:55.060 --> 49:56.694
All this bamboo's come off.

49:56.694 --> 49:58.129
What have you untied?

49:58.129 --> 50:00.365
I've untied the piece
of string at the front.

50:00.365 --> 50:04.602
But, look, half the craft
is disappearing.

50:04.602 --> 50:07.738
JAMES: As the raft
was disintegrating fast,

50:07.738 --> 50:10.508
we had to get it
to shore quickly.

50:10.508 --> 50:12.510
JEREMY:
Firing up the machine!

50:15.246 --> 50:17.882
Sadly, though,
Jeremy's turn of speed

50:17.882 --> 50:19.784
only made things worse.

50:19.784 --> 50:21.952
Power! Power! Come on!

50:21.952 --> 50:23.254
Slow down!

50:24.322 --> 50:26.924
It's falling apart!

50:26.924 --> 50:29.560
RICHARD:
Look, he's going down!
JAMES: Slow down!

50:29.560 --> 50:32.029
Slow!

50:39.470 --> 50:42.340
RICHARD: You can't put cars
on that, can you?

50:42.340 --> 50:44.809
JEREMY:
After we'd rescued James,

50:44.809 --> 50:47.712
he stupidly suggested that,
to solve the problem,

50:47.712 --> 50:50.815
we should ruin
everyone's holiday.

51:00.558 --> 51:03.494
I think these people
should move out of the way.

51:03.494 --> 51:06.564
My plan was to tow the cars
off the beach

51:06.564 --> 51:10.135
and back to the harbour
so we could start again.

51:10.135 --> 51:14.038
Which meant I'd need the help
of the man from Atlantis.

51:14.038 --> 51:17.242
Hold my hand! There! There!
There! Now, let me go.

51:17.242 --> 51:18.676
Yeah, that's me.
You have to let...

51:18.676 --> 51:21.979
Oh, mind my arm!
Let me go now. I'm fine.

51:21.979 --> 51:23.214
I don't like it!

51:27.685 --> 51:29.320
Move!

51:36.194 --> 51:39.830
Hammond, tie both of them to
this and give me a thumbs up.

51:39.830 --> 51:42.066
If James gets those
onto the road,

51:42.066 --> 51:43.768
all the way back up to
the harbour,

51:43.768 --> 51:47.438
build another raft,
get them loaded on...

51:47.438 --> 51:50.275
...bring them back,
it's gonna take days.

51:53.544 --> 51:55.813
- OK.
- Don't stand near the back.

51:55.813 --> 51:56.781
The brakes don't work.

52:00.518 --> 52:02.187
Yeah!

52:14.699 --> 52:17.435
- That was rubbish.

52:18.803 --> 52:21.639
I then said we should
use my brilliant boat

52:21.639 --> 52:24.442
to tow the cars back
to the reef site,

52:24.442 --> 52:26.644
which would be quicker
and easier.

52:32.116 --> 52:35.052
JEREMY: They're in the water!

52:36.921 --> 52:39.224
Ha-ha! Power!

52:39.224 --> 52:40.691
Power! Come on!

52:42.627 --> 52:44.229
Yes!

52:44.229 --> 52:46.931
Eat my boat, James May!

52:49.900 --> 52:51.035
Come on!

52:55.039 --> 52:56.807
Victory is the boat's!

53:00.110 --> 53:02.313
James May's hopeless plan...

53:04.148 --> 53:05.450
What was that?

53:07.418 --> 53:10.321
With two rusty Peugeots
in his swimming area

53:10.321 --> 53:12.657
and his beach furniture
in ruins,

53:12.657 --> 53:15.025
the hotel manager
had had enough

53:15.025 --> 53:16.761
and ordered us to leave.

53:18.529 --> 53:22.667
We'd now lost four cars,
a boat and our raft.

53:22.667 --> 53:25.970
But on the plus side,
we still had one car left,

53:25.970 --> 53:30.007
and most importantly,
the crane boat.

53:30.007 --> 53:32.977
But that night,
there was bad news.

53:37.515 --> 53:41.452
The man who owns it
is not best pleased with us.

53:41.452 --> 53:44.389
- He has off-hired it.

53:44.389 --> 53:47.292
- We've not got
the crane boat?
- No.

53:47.292 --> 53:50.795
- That was the most
useful thing we had.
- Yeah.

53:50.795 --> 53:54.665
So what can we possibly do
with a Land Rover?

53:54.665 --> 53:57.067
JAMES: Well...
RICHARD: Well, what?

53:57.067 --> 53:59.404
If I can be positive...

53:59.404 --> 54:01.005
The Land Rover's
largely aluminium,

54:01.005 --> 54:04.309
which is actually even better
for creating a reef.

54:04.309 --> 54:05.576
- True.
- But it's on the land!

54:05.576 --> 54:07.812
Yes, it is true.
The Land Rover is--

54:07.812 --> 54:09.947
It's irrelevant.
We've lost everything else.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.849
Yes, but it's good if...

54:14.319 --> 54:16.120
I've had a brainwave.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.555
Oh, God.

54:20.391 --> 54:22.360
JEREMY:
And so, the next morning,

54:22.360 --> 54:24.762
the people of Barbados
were treated

54:24.762 --> 54:26.497
to the magnificent spectacle

54:26.497 --> 54:28.966
of a Land Rover
gliding majestically

54:28.966 --> 54:30.568
on a bed of inner tubes

54:30.568 --> 54:33.338
across the Caribbean Sea.

54:33.338 --> 54:36.073
Here we are on our final car,
and it's a classic.

54:36.073 --> 54:37.642
It's a Series I Land Rover.

54:37.642 --> 54:39.477
No, it's a Series II.

54:39.477 --> 54:41.346
It's a Series I. The lights
are close together.

54:41.346 --> 54:43.213
No, it's got the barrel
rolls on the doors.

54:43.213 --> 54:44.582
It's a Series II.

54:44.582 --> 54:45.983
- Yeah.

54:45.983 --> 54:47.852
I thought Series IIs
had the lights angled.

54:47.852 --> 54:49.654
I think we're getting
stuck on this.

54:49.654 --> 54:51.656
- It's a Land Rover.
- It's an old Land Rover.

54:51.656 --> 54:53.090
The good thing about it is

54:53.090 --> 54:54.792
it corrodes much less
quickly than the steel car.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.362
We've also glued these limestone
tiles to it,

54:57.362 --> 55:01.466
because porous limestone is
the perfect base, foundation,

55:01.466 --> 55:03.468
for coral to start a reef.

55:03.468 --> 55:06.771
This is a coral-reef-making
machine.

55:06.771 --> 55:09.807
In fact, the only fly
in the ointment

55:09.807 --> 55:12.777
was its propulsion system.

55:12.777 --> 55:15.546
- OTHERS: No!

55:15.546 --> 55:17.682
RICHARD: It's filling with
water the faster you go.

55:17.682 --> 55:19.116
We'll sink it
in the wrong place.

55:19.116 --> 55:22.553
This is our last car,
our last chance.

55:22.553 --> 55:25.723
They're bleating on.
"Oh, don't go too fast!"

55:25.723 --> 55:28.393
RICHARD: You're going faster
again, Jeremy!

55:28.393 --> 55:30.928
You're pulling it under!

55:30.928 --> 55:32.497
Relax!

55:32.497 --> 55:33.964
JAMES: Am I
the same species as that?

55:33.964 --> 55:35.165
RICHARD: No.

55:35.165 --> 55:37.167
Jeremy, don't sink it

55:37.167 --> 55:39.003
before we get there!

55:39.003 --> 55:41.806
Mother of God!
Have you seen that?

55:41.806 --> 55:43.408
- Guys, look!

55:43.408 --> 55:46.611
RICHARD: Oh, my God!
JEREMY: Holy cow! Look at it!

55:47.712 --> 55:49.447
RICHARD: That is phenomenal!

55:49.447 --> 55:51.682
JEREMY: Yeah! Racing!

55:51.682 --> 55:54.652
Jeremy, you're going to
sink us! Don't race it!

55:54.652 --> 55:57.722
Catch the... Oh, I haven't
got time for these two.

55:57.722 --> 56:00.791
Right. Let's go catch
that sailing boat!

56:02.860 --> 56:04.929
Oh, brilliant!

56:17.107 --> 56:18.476
Watch this, sunshine.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.649
That is the fastest thing
I've...

56:24.649 --> 56:26.617
Why is it faster than me?

56:34.258 --> 56:38.496
They're so good, breeze is
beating brake horsepower.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.130
I cannot keep up with it.

56:44.469 --> 56:47.371
RICHARD: When do we drink
our own urine?

56:47.371 --> 56:49.073
Look at that thing now!

56:57.247 --> 56:58.549
Bloody Nora!

57:05.255 --> 57:08.192
That is just... fabulous!

57:15.966 --> 57:19.203
I could have buzzed around
this amazing machine all day,

57:19.203 --> 57:22.673
but there was still important
environmental work to do.

57:22.673 --> 57:24.909
So, reluctantly, I broke off

57:24.909 --> 57:27.712
to rejoin
my stranded colleagues.

57:31.882 --> 57:33.818
- Well, no!

57:33.818 --> 57:36.420
We've just been left
to drift in a Land Rover!

57:36.420 --> 57:39.023
Fortunately for you, none of
these ceramic tiles is loose,

57:39.023 --> 57:40.891
otherwise I'd chuck it
at your head.

57:48.365 --> 57:50.668
Do you know, I think
it actually handles better

57:50.668 --> 57:52.102
than it does on land.

57:52.102 --> 57:55.172
Soon, we will reach
the reef site,

57:55.172 --> 57:57.174
puncture the inner tubes,
the Land Rover will sink,

57:57.174 --> 58:00.244
and it will become
a safe haven for cod

58:00.244 --> 58:03.948
and haddock and...bream.

58:06.684 --> 58:08.352
Eventually,
we reached the site

58:08.352 --> 58:11.556
and said about scuttling
our reef machine.

58:19.463 --> 58:21.632
JEREMY: Fire!

58:21.632 --> 58:24.101
JAMES: Yes!
JEREMY: Yes!

58:28.338 --> 58:30.440
JEREMY: Here we go!

58:30.440 --> 58:32.476
Down! Sink!

58:32.476 --> 58:33.778
JAMES: Whoo!

58:41.986 --> 58:44.822
In truth, all great
environmental projects

58:44.822 --> 58:47.024
are beset with problems.

58:47.024 --> 58:50.194
And ours, through no fault
of our own, except James's,

58:50.194 --> 58:51.295
was no exception.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.901
Save it! Stop!

59:03.608 --> 59:05.242
So, in the end, our new reef

59:05.242 --> 59:08.779
wasn't quite as spectacular
as we'd hoped.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.247
But it was a start,

59:10.247 --> 59:12.449
and one day it'll be
the core of something

59:12.449 --> 59:14.619
a thousand miles long--

59:14.619 --> 59:16.486
a new and beautiful home

59:16.486 --> 59:19.990
for the cod and the haddock
of the Caribbean.

59:43.914 --> 59:46.283
- Thank you so much.

59:46.283 --> 59:48.853
And a very big thank you
to the government of Barbados

59:48.853 --> 59:50.354
for helping us
with that film.

59:50.354 --> 59:53.290
And we'd just like to say
no coral was damaged

59:53.290 --> 59:55.059
while we were
building our reef.

59:55.059 --> 59:59.063
No. Or, if we're
perfectly honest, created.

59:59.063 --> 1:00:01.098
However, we came back
with a brilliant idea.

1:00:01.098 --> 1:00:02.967
You see, we liked it
in the Caribbean.

1:00:02.967 --> 1:00:04.869
Our crews liked it
in the Caribbean.

1:00:04.869 --> 1:00:06.871
So we thought it would be
a good idea, next week,

1:00:06.871 --> 1:00:08.172
to make a film

1:00:08.172 --> 1:00:10.875
comparing the motoring
cultures of the French,

1:00:10.875 --> 1:00:12.376
the Dutch
and the British Islands.

1:00:12.376 --> 1:00:14.411
- Yeah, it was a great idea.
- Brilliant idea.

1:00:14.411 --> 1:00:15.813
But Mr Wilman, our producer,

1:00:15.813 --> 1:00:17.715
he decided it wasn't
a brilliant idea,

1:00:17.715 --> 1:00:19.216
and that, instead,

1:00:19.216 --> 1:00:21.185
we should go to northern
France with three old cars

1:00:21.185 --> 1:00:23.287
- and drive around in the rain.

1:00:23.287 --> 1:00:25.055
So that's what
we're actually doing.

1:00:25.055 --> 1:00:27.157
And on that
terrible disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:00:27.157 --> 1:00:28.793
Thank you so much
for watching.

1:00:28.793 --> 1:00:31.395
Thank you for coming.
See you soon. Take care.

1:00:31.395 --> 1:00:33.097
- RICHARD: See you next time.
