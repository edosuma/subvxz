WEBVTT

00:09.435 --> 00:10.905
Who is that?

00:12.375 --> 00:14.698
Could that be Raven Baxter?

00:14.699 --> 00:16.769
The fabulous new
fashion reporter

00:16.770 --> 00:18.421
for our school newspaper?

00:18.422 --> 00:19.476
Oh, yeah, baby.

00:19.477 --> 00:20.440
I think it is.

00:20.441 --> 00:23.362
And is that her best
friend, Chelsea Daniels--

00:23.363 --> 00:24.611
the new star photographer--

00:24.612 --> 00:26.500
taking all
the front page photos?!

00:26.501 --> 00:28.393
Yes, baby, give it to me!
Work it, work it.

00:28.394 --> 00:31.105
Be a tiger, be a tiger.
Yes, growl. Whoo!

00:31.106 --> 00:33.725
Man, I hope we actually
get in our newspaper.

00:33.726 --> 00:34.886
Hmm, we better, girl.

00:34.887 --> 00:36.728
It took me three weeks
to make this outfit.

00:36.729 --> 00:38.257
It took me three weeks
to load this camera.

00:39.328 --> 00:40.509
Here comes the kid.

00:40.510 --> 00:42.368
He stops, he shoots...

00:43.105 --> 00:45.022
Huh-- he scores, boo-yah!

00:45.023 --> 00:46.625
Eddie, you hit the wall.

00:46.626 --> 00:47.691
I can do that.

00:51.163 --> 00:52.319
My bad!

00:55.475 --> 00:57.975
Nice of you
to join us, ladies.

00:58.411 --> 00:59.936
We have a saying

00:59.937 --> 01:02.140
here at The Barracudian...

01:02.440 --> 01:03.577
"Be on time."

01:05.470 --> 01:07.198
Now, to continue

01:07.199 --> 01:09.797
our lead reporter
and star photographer

01:09.798 --> 01:11.934
will once again be...
Serena.

01:12.702 --> 01:13.871
Thank you.

01:14.335 --> 01:17.793
You know, a good reporter
doesn't just cover the news...

01:17.794 --> 01:20.095
she discovers the news.

01:20.096 --> 01:20.804
Thank you.

01:20.805 --> 01:22.436
Now, discover your seat.

01:23.912 --> 01:26.221
To continue,
our junior photographer

01:26.222 --> 01:27.259
will be...

01:27.664 --> 01:28.896
Who owns a camera?

01:32.900 --> 01:34.713
Oh! Oh, I do. I do.

01:34.714 --> 01:36.099
Congratulations, Chelsea.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.026
Oh, my gosh, yes, yes!

01:38.027 --> 01:40.284
How can I remember this moment?

01:41.085 --> 01:42.104
Oh.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.209
And our sports reporter
will be Raven.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.576
Sports?

01:48.577 --> 01:50.834
But I really wanted
to cover fashion.

01:50.835 --> 01:54.039
Well, you were fashionably late,
so I gave it to Lester.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.475
Lester?

01:57.035 --> 01:58.174
Whoo!

01:58.175 --> 01:59.843
See, Lester?

01:59.844 --> 02:01.200
Dreams do come true.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.765
Don't worry, Rae.

02:03.766 --> 02:04.809
We're still going
to have a lot of fun.

02:04.810 --> 02:05.870
Right, Serena?

02:06.285 --> 02:08.804
This is not about fun.

02:08.805 --> 02:11.935
This is about reporting the news
and exposing the truth.

02:12.335 --> 02:13.801
And don't expect

02:13.802 --> 02:15.694
to get anything
on the front page.

02:15.695 --> 02:17.291
That's my territory.

02:18.811 --> 02:20.204
Hate her.

02:20.663 --> 02:21.813
Heard that.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.805 --> 02:34.250
Did you just have
a vision?

02:34.251 --> 02:35.934
Girl, yes, and we are

02:35.935 --> 02:38.548
about to knock Serena
off the front page.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.472
Boo-yah! Whoo!

03:30.014 --> 03:31.305
Yep, that's me.

03:37.335 --> 03:38.565
It's wide!

03:38.566 --> 03:41.091
Oh, shoot it, shoot it!

03:41.410 --> 03:43.583
He scored! Yes!

03:46.135 --> 03:47.635
I got to start
wearing a helmet.

03:50.108 --> 03:54.686
Ooh, it's basketball night
at the Baxters!

03:54.687 --> 03:56.689
That is basketball, right?

03:57.835 --> 04:00.515
Yeah. The Warriors
versus the Lakers.

04:00.516 --> 04:02.769
Ooh, sounds interesting.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.206
Scoochie, scoochie!

04:06.698 --> 04:07.764
Hey!

04:07.765 --> 04:08.927
That's where we sit.

04:08.928 --> 04:10.234
Right, Lionel?

04:10.235 --> 04:12.039
Well, it doesn't
have your name on it.

04:12.040 --> 04:12.904
Yeah, it does.

04:12.905 --> 04:13.731
Where?

04:14.748 --> 04:15.948
We got her.

04:16.937 --> 04:19.139
Look, get up,
"Rat Boy," okay?

04:19.140 --> 04:20.534
I have to watch this.

04:20.535 --> 04:23.069
Rae, since when are you
interested in sports?

04:23.070 --> 04:25.509
Since I became
a sports journalist--

04:25.510 --> 04:27.474
a very serious one, at that.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.134
Who let the Lakers out of
the house looking like that?

04:30.135 --> 04:33.073
Purple and gold,
can we say "clash"?

04:33.680 --> 04:36.246
Can you say it in another room?

04:36.247 --> 04:38.640
'Cause Lionel and I are trying
to watch the game.

04:39.373 --> 04:40.921
Fine, if you don't want me here
and you think I'm going

04:40.922 --> 04:43.398
to be disturbing, you just say
the word and I'm out of here.

04:43.399 --> 04:44.459
Bye.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.139
No, I'm serious.

04:47.140 --> 04:48.240
Bye.

04:49.005 --> 04:51.466
Aw, stop playing, y'all,
come on now...

04:51.775 --> 04:53.010
Okay, bye.

04:55.335 --> 04:56.842
Ooh! Time out.

04:56.843 --> 04:58.274
Bring on the
Warrior girls.

04:58.275 --> 05:00.025
# Ooh, ooh,
go, Warriors #

05:02.110 --> 05:03.904
Corey... Corey.

05:03.905 --> 05:06.269
Don't you have a
science project due?

05:06.270 --> 05:07.545
Yeah, you're supposed

05:07.546 --> 05:09.839
to be making a project
of the solar system.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.004
I haven't seen it.

05:11.005 --> 05:12.722
That's 'cause
it's still in my head.

05:13.976 --> 05:15.901
How many times
have we told you

05:15.902 --> 05:17.575
that you can't keep waiting
till the last minute?

05:17.908 --> 05:19.305
I can if you help me.

05:20.035 --> 05:22.354
Look, honey,
you're never going to learn

05:22.355 --> 05:23.721
if we always
do it for you.

05:23.722 --> 05:26.993
I appreciate that, but I'm
willing to take the risk.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.004
Bye.

05:32.623 --> 05:33.504
Perfect!

05:33.505 --> 05:35.209
Just the way I saw
it in my vision.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.375
Eddie, guard the door.

05:47.175 --> 05:49.769
Everybody's gone home,
and yet

05:49.770 --> 05:51.332
you're still here.

05:51.645 --> 05:52.984
Why is that?

05:53.586 --> 05:55.119
Well, I'm not guarding this door

05:55.120 --> 05:56.129
if that's what you're thinking.

05:56.130 --> 05:57.160
Hmm!

05:57.675 --> 05:59.769
I am too good a reporter
to fall for this.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.534
You're obviously
hiding something.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.476
So, you already know
about the roof, huh?

06:03.917 --> 06:06.280
Oops... I've said too much.

06:06.281 --> 06:08.729
No, you said just enough.

06:11.919 --> 06:14.631
Okay, Chelsea, you need
to be standing right...

06:14.632 --> 06:16.858
right... right about
there, right there.

06:17.431 --> 06:19.535
Yeah, Rae, does he have to come
through this window?

06:19.536 --> 06:20.481
Because, really,
the lighting is

06:20.482 --> 06:21.348
so much better
on the other si...

06:21.349 --> 06:23.295
Chelsea, focus!

06:26.309 --> 06:27.720
The camera!

06:28.673 --> 06:29.504
Camera.

06:29.505 --> 06:30.505
Sorry, sorry.

06:42.054 --> 06:43.559
Hey, you're a clown.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.690
Yeah, and I'm guessing

06:44.691 --> 06:47.567
this isn't Casey Epstein's
sixth birthday party.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.409
This is so amazing.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.669
My friend knew that this
was going to happen.

06:52.670 --> 06:55.004
Why, is she, like,
psychic or something?

06:55.005 --> 06:58.069
Oh, yeah, but be quiet, 'cause she
really doesn't want anyone to know.

06:58.070 --> 06:58.964
Yeah, except for us.

06:58.965 --> 07:01.109
Yeah, and her family...
and now, you.

07:01.110 --> 07:03.034
Guys, hello! Zip it.

07:03.035 --> 07:04.369
He doesn't even
know your name.

07:04.370 --> 07:05.400
Yeah, Raven.

07:06.879 --> 07:07.949
You knew I was going

07:07.950 --> 07:09.074
to crash through that window?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.234
Actually, yeah.

07:11.235 --> 07:12.926
So, why didn't you open it?

07:20.805 --> 07:24.169
Raven, Chelsea,
fantastic story, huh?

07:24.170 --> 07:26.069
Front page,
first time out.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.475
That's pretty good.

07:27.826 --> 07:29.091
One moment.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.434
Maybe a little too good.

07:32.435 --> 07:35.830
How did two rookie reporters
know the exact moment

07:35.831 --> 07:38.445
a skydiving clown
would crash through the window?

07:38.891 --> 07:43.538
The better question is,
"How could you not know?"

07:46.875 --> 07:49.171
Okay, my shining stars

07:49.172 --> 07:51.336
I have a big,
big surprise for you.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.329
Have you heard
of Boys In Motion?

07:53.330 --> 07:54.617
We love that band.

07:54.618 --> 07:57.810
Yeah. Those boys are, like,
always in motion.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.109
I just got it.

08:00.110 --> 08:01.074
Well...

08:01.075 --> 08:03.636
they sent over two press passes.

08:03.637 --> 08:04.742
I want you

08:04.743 --> 08:06.697
to cover
the concert Friday night.

08:10.028 --> 08:12.204
# We are the boys in motion #

08:13.475 --> 08:15.359
# We give you
our devotion-- uh! #

08:15.360 --> 08:17.175
# We give you our
devotion... #

08:19.475 --> 08:21.954
Excuse me,
Senorita Rodriguez.

08:21.955 --> 08:25.110
I- I hate to break up
the show, but...

08:25.111 --> 08:27.191
Raven is the
sports reporter

08:27.192 --> 08:30.339
and I believe there's a
basketball game that night.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.024
Say what?

08:31.531 --> 08:33.027
I mean, you put

08:33.028 --> 08:36.049
so much thought and care
into giving us our assignments

08:36.051 --> 08:38.496
I would hate to see the
quality of the newspaper suffer

08:38.498 --> 08:41.217
because we forgot to cover
an important school activity.

08:41.219 --> 08:43.765
Oh, Serena,
you are such a kiss-up.

08:43.767 --> 08:44.889
You will go far.

08:45.405 --> 08:47.725
Chelsea, you cover
the concert.

08:47.726 --> 08:49.339
Raven, you cover
the game.

08:49.340 --> 08:50.467
No.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.000
Hate her... more.

08:59.355 --> 09:01.275
We got a big game
tomorrow, guys.

09:02.535 --> 09:05.084
I have front row seats
to Boys In Motion

09:05.085 --> 09:07.275
and I have to sit here
and cover a game.

09:07.276 --> 09:09.335
Basketball...
is so stupid.

09:12.075 --> 09:13.480
Ooh, Rae...

09:13.481 --> 09:15.291
I think you made it mad.

09:15.292 --> 09:16.934
Hey, yo, yo, yo.

09:16.935 --> 09:18.234
I'm sorry about that.

09:18.235 --> 09:20.639
Gino still needs a little
work on his passing.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.177
Yeah.
Yo, Gino.

09:25.605 --> 09:29.175
You know, I really don't know
that much about sports, Eddie

09:29.176 --> 09:30.669
but how did he get
on the team?

09:30.670 --> 09:32.151
You know,
we're not sure

09:32.152 --> 09:33.834
but we think he's
related to the coach.

09:36.435 --> 09:38.488
Eddie, let's get to work.

09:39.038 --> 09:40.679
I'm starting you
in the next game.

09:42.694 --> 09:43.904
Di-Did you hear that?

09:43.905 --> 09:46.509
Yo, I'm finally
getting to start!

09:46.510 --> 09:47.625
Yay, Eddie!

09:47.626 --> 09:48.949
Dig it! Yay! Whoo!

09:48.950 --> 09:50.519
Whoo, Eddie! Yes!
All right! Yay! Whoo!

09:50.520 --> 09:52.369
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

09:52.370 --> 09:53.527
Starting what?

09:53.528 --> 09:54.670
I don't know.
Yeah.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.974
You had another vision?
Oh, yeah.

10:11.975 --> 10:14.169
I just saw Eddie making
the winning basket

10:14.170 --> 10:15.766
Yay.
at the final buzzer.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.523
We're going to win
the game tomorrow.

10:17.524 --> 10:19.075
And do you know
what that means?

10:19.450 --> 10:20.993
Yes.

10:21.866 --> 10:23.296
No. Should I?

10:23.635 --> 10:25.521
Yes. It means
that I know

10:25.522 --> 10:27.073
what's going to happen
before it happens

10:27.074 --> 10:30.809
so I can write the article
and not go to the game.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.569
Do you know what
that means?

10:32.570 --> 10:33.535
Yes!

10:35.575 --> 10:37.709
No. Can we please stop
playing now?

10:37.710 --> 10:38.834
Chelsea

10:38.835 --> 10:42.301
I can go to the
concert with you.

10:42.302 --> 10:42.904
Yes, yes.

10:42.905 --> 10:44.674
I love being
psychic.

10:47.042 --> 10:48.507
Psychic?

10:48.508 --> 10:51.059
Who's got the scoop now, Raven?

10:54.438 --> 10:56.939
So, should be
a great game tomorrow.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.583
You must be excited.

10:58.964 --> 11:01.550
Oh, yeah, 'cause, you know,
I hope our team makes

11:01.551 --> 11:03.906
more points than the other team,
'cause, you know

11:03.907 --> 11:06.526
that's how you win
in basketball. Holler.

11:06.527 --> 11:09.298
I bet the crowd goes wild
when Eddie scores

11:09.299 --> 11:11.252
that winning basket
at the buzzer.

11:13.804 --> 11:15.583
Oh, oh, yeah.

11:15.584 --> 11:19.436
I bet they would... if something
like that were to happen

11:19.437 --> 11:21.556
but who's to know, really?

11:21.557 --> 11:22.580
Buh-bye.

11:22.581 --> 11:26.126
Actually...
I think you know.

11:30.335 --> 11:32.374
"Eddie Wins for Fins"?

11:32.375 --> 11:33.833
Where'd you get that?

11:33.834 --> 11:35.724
I found it
on the computer

11:35.725 --> 11:37.484
but here's
a better question:

11:37.485 --> 11:39.441
"How could you
write this today

11:39.442 --> 11:41.670
when the game's
not till tomorrow?"

11:42.007 --> 11:45.005
That's... that's just
a practice article.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.064
Well, you should see
my article.

11:48.065 --> 11:50.304
"Psychic Freak
Walks Among Us"?

11:51.128 --> 11:53.165
Girl...

11:53.635 --> 11:55.344
Girl, you be tripping.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.927
Yeah, well, if the game
turns out the way you predicted

11:59.928 --> 12:01.786
the whole school's
going to be tripping.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.046
See you on the front page.

12:18.726 --> 12:19.775
Rae, I don't know.

12:19.776 --> 12:22.451
Maybe it's time for everyone
to know your secret identity.

12:22.923 --> 12:25.377
Chels, I am psychic,
not Batgirl.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.901
Now hold still.

12:26.902 --> 12:28.716
Do you want to look good
for the concert, or not?

12:28.717 --> 12:30.104
Rae, come on,
don't avoid the issue.

12:30.105 --> 12:32.863
Okay, look, what if everyone
finds out you're psychic?

12:32.864 --> 12:34.686
You know, what's the worst
that could happen?

12:34.687 --> 12:36.486
I just want to fit in, Chels

12:36.487 --> 12:38.217
and if Eddie makes
the winning shot

12:38.218 --> 12:40.141
then Serena's going to print
the article about me

12:40.142 --> 12:42.869
and I will be known
as the school weirdo.

12:42.870 --> 12:43.674
Ouch.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.034
I know, it stinks.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.768
No, Rae, you just stuck me.

12:46.769 --> 12:47.808
Sorry.

12:48.693 --> 12:49.934
Chels...

12:49.935 --> 12:51.974
I can't let this vision
come true.

12:51.975 --> 12:54.109
Rae, why don't you just ask
Eddie to miss the shot?

12:54.110 --> 12:55.456
That's like cheating.

12:55.457 --> 12:56.734
He would never do that.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.233
You know,
I have no choice.

12:58.234 --> 12:59.885
I just have to stop him myself.

12:59.886 --> 13:01.471
Yeah, and you know what, Rae?

13:01.806 --> 13:03.724
I'm going to be right there
with you.

13:03.725 --> 13:05.804
Oh, you go to the concert,
Chels.

13:05.805 --> 13:06.759
You don't have to do that.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.624
Oh, but Rae, sweetie, I do.

13:08.625 --> 13:10.385
You're pinned to my pants.

13:10.386 --> 13:12.419
Chelsea. Chelsea!

13:12.420 --> 13:13.653
Chelsea!

13:13.982 --> 13:15.274
Hey, guys.

13:15.275 --> 13:16.387
Hey.

13:17.504 --> 13:18.548
Dad, no!

13:18.549 --> 13:20.061
Don't eat that.
Why?

13:20.062 --> 13:20.595
What's wrong with it?

13:20.596 --> 13:22.300
Nothing. It's Neptune.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.677
It's part of Corey's
science project...

13:26.570 --> 13:28.076
the solar system.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.661
Our solar system?

13:31.594 --> 13:33.826
Okay, we're going to lose
the fruit and do this right.

13:35.163 --> 13:37.024
Victor, I thought
we agreed

13:37.025 --> 13:38.774
to let Corey do this
without our help.

13:38.775 --> 13:41.726
He needs to either sink
or swim on his own.

13:41.727 --> 13:42.821
Hey, guys.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.771
Check it out.

13:43.772 --> 13:48.323
It's a meteor because it's
"meatier" than other planets.

14:04.046 --> 14:06.269
You're down here
doing Corey's project.

14:06.270 --> 14:07.335
You can't prove that.

14:12.689 --> 14:13.785
Okay, you can.

14:14.976 --> 14:16.404
Wait a minute.

14:16.405 --> 14:18.555
Is that a glue gun?

14:20.435 --> 14:21.894
Well, I couldn't sleep

14:21.895 --> 14:23.373
and I thought I'd catch up
on my gluing.

14:24.398 --> 14:26.498
Victor, admit it.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.434
Neither one of us can stand by
and watch Corey fail.

14:29.435 --> 14:34.097
Well, maybe we don't have to do
the whole project for him.

14:34.098 --> 14:34.907
Yeah.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.097
We can just spruce it up a bit.

14:37.098 --> 14:38.180
You're right.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.731
Opening
the sprucing machine.

14:54.270 --> 14:55.243
Man!

14:55.244 --> 14:56.539
Time out.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.974
Hi, Raven.

14:57.975 --> 14:59.544
I can't wait
for that final buzzer.

14:59.545 --> 15:01.280
Now that's going
to be news.

15:02.488 --> 15:03.632
Good hustle out there.

15:03.633 --> 15:04.836
We can still
win this game.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.509
Eddie, don't lose
your confidence.

15:06.510 --> 15:07.212
Keep shooting.

15:07.213 --> 15:09.101
Now, Coach, do you really
think that's a good idea?

15:09.102 --> 15:11.173
Rae!
No, now pay attention.

15:11.174 --> 15:13.193
I am the sports
reporter up in here.

15:13.194 --> 15:14.266
Now, listen up.

15:14.267 --> 15:17.613
We are not going to
pass the ball to Eddie.

15:17.614 --> 15:18.811
I'm a Barracuda
rooter!

15:18.812 --> 15:19.773
Who are you?!
Hey!

15:19.774 --> 15:21.214
Would you get up
out of here?

15:23.605 --> 15:24.380
Hey, Rae.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.735
Oh, gosh, I couldn't
enjoy the concert

15:26.736 --> 15:28.432
knowing that my best
friend was here in trouble.

15:28.433 --> 15:29.896
So, you know, I came.

15:29.897 --> 15:31.366
Heard it was canceled.

15:32.261 --> 15:34.065
Yeah, well, there
was that too.

15:39.775 --> 15:40.935
Yes!

15:42.627 --> 15:44.454
I'm getting hot, Rae.
I'm feeling it!

15:47.849 --> 15:49.261
I have a feeling
this is going to be

15:49.262 --> 15:50.569
the best issue ever.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.909
I'll be handing out copies
at the end of the game.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.374
Hey, Rae.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.559
I totally took care
of everything.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.006
Let's see them
play without this.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.084
Sic 'em!

16:03.053 --> 16:03.882
No, I'm just...

16:03.883 --> 16:04.610
Wait, okay?

16:04.611 --> 16:05.847
I don't think
this is necessary.

16:05.848 --> 16:08.186
Listen, you do not
understand.

16:08.655 --> 16:10.272
My friend here

16:10.273 --> 16:11.420
she is, uh,

16:11.421 --> 16:13.531
a foreign exchange student

16:13.532 --> 16:17.194
and in her country,
stealing a basketball ensures

16:17.195 --> 16:18.474
a plentiful harvest.

16:18.475 --> 16:19.609
She's right, you know.

16:24.175 --> 16:25.215
Well...

16:25.216 --> 16:26.948
it's been nice being normal.

16:26.949 --> 16:28.889
Say hello to the new
school freak.

16:39.461 --> 16:41.540
Hey, you want a
piece of the fish?

16:41.541 --> 16:42.834
You want a piece
of the fish?

16:42.835 --> 16:43.704
Barry! Barry!

16:43.705 --> 16:44.954
I'm talking trash.
Come on.

16:44.955 --> 16:46.169
You want a piece
of the fish?

16:46.170 --> 16:47.130
Hey, Barry.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.972
I'm talking trash.

16:50.616 --> 16:51.858
Rae... Rae?

16:51.859 --> 16:52.404
Yo!

16:52.405 --> 16:53.435
Time out!

16:55.077 --> 16:56.517
What are you doing?

16:56.518 --> 16:59.010
Eddie, stop playing with
the fish and get over here.

17:02.501 --> 17:04.614
And now put your fins together

17:04.615 --> 17:06.541
for a Barry, our Bayside

17:06.542 --> 17:08.874
Barracuda!

17:08.875 --> 17:14.012
Go, Bayside!

17:33.905 --> 17:35.415
Hey, Bayside.

17:35.416 --> 17:38.030
Are you ready for
the dunk-o-rama?

17:38.031 --> 17:39.860
I want to see that.

17:39.861 --> 17:40.659
I'm ready.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.057
Barry's going
to take this ball

17:43.058 --> 17:45.510
and dunk it through
that hoop

17:45.511 --> 17:47.803
using that trampoline.

17:47.804 --> 17:49.743
Barry's going to do what?

17:50.449 --> 17:57.107
Barry! Barry!

17:57.108 --> 18:00.182
Well, I guess this fish
got to fly.

18:00.183 --> 18:08.379
Barry! Barry!

18:28.968 --> 18:30.234
Hey, y'all.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.548
It's okay.

18:31.549 --> 18:34.018
Just-Just Barry being Barry.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.731
Rae, what are you doing?

18:51.320 --> 18:52.419
Listen, Eddie.

18:52.420 --> 18:55.146
I had a vision and you're going
to score the winning the basket

18:55.147 --> 18:56.169
at the final buzzer.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.474
I am?!
Mm-hmm.

18:57.475 --> 19:00.444
Yo, Rae, that's what I've been
waiting for my whole life.

19:02.337 --> 19:04.934
But... why you been trying
to mess me up?

19:05.526 --> 19:07.565
Because I already wrote
an article about it

19:07.566 --> 19:08.574
and Serena found it.

19:08.575 --> 19:09.725
If my vision comes true

19:09.726 --> 19:11.851
she's going to let the
whole school know I'm psychic

19:11.852 --> 19:14.707
and, you know, I'm just
not ready for that.

19:15.930 --> 19:19.413
Man, that's rough, but...
the winning shot.

19:21.117 --> 19:21.954
You know what?

19:24.335 --> 19:25.633
It was my own fault.

19:25.634 --> 19:27.066
I was just thinking
about myself.

19:27.067 --> 19:30.970
So, you go out there and
you take that shot, Eddie.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.371
Really?

19:32.372 --> 19:33.437
Yeah.

19:33.934 --> 19:35.022
I've got to go.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.916
Shoot it, Eddie.
Shoot it.

19:55.224 --> 19:56.557
Gino!

19:59.029 --> 20:01.007
No...!

20:19.745 --> 20:21.204
Eddie.

20:21.205 --> 20:22.804
Why didn't you make that shot?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.809
That was supposed to be you
up there.

20:24.810 --> 20:25.974
That would've been tight

20:25.975 --> 20:27.869
but not while it threatens
my friend.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.673
Besides,
I'm sure I'll get

20:29.674 --> 20:31.224
another chance to score
the winning basket.

20:31.225 --> 20:32.508
You think? Because when
you look at the odds

20:32.509 --> 20:33.873
I mean, really,
the chances of you getting...

20:33.874 --> 20:37.361
Actually, he will definitely
get another chance.

20:38.510 --> 20:39.453
Thanks, Rae.

20:39.454 --> 20:40.720
You know what I think?

20:40.721 --> 20:42.917
This whole psychic thing
was a setup

20:42.918 --> 20:44.609
just to make me look bad.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.145
You got me.

20:46.635 --> 20:48.769
Or maybe that's what you want me
to think.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.790
Oh, snap,
you got me again.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.534
Cute, Raven.

20:53.535 --> 20:57.169
There's a story here
and I'm going to find it.

20:57.170 --> 20:59.972
Not if we find it first.

21:00.811 --> 21:03.092
That made no sense.

21:04.475 --> 21:06.629
Yeah, but it got her
to walk away.

21:08.202 --> 21:11.511
Uh, guys, I think we need
to get out of here.

21:11.512 --> 21:13.119
Why, you have
another vision?

21:13.120 --> 21:15.175
No, Barry wants
his fish suit back.

21:15.176 --> 21:16.265
Come on!

21:24.605 --> 21:26.423
I got my science project back.

21:26.424 --> 21:27.585
Oh, great!

21:27.586 --> 21:29.738
How did we...
um, how'd you do?

21:29.739 --> 21:31.333
I got an "A."

21:31.334 --> 21:32.638
All right.

21:34.258 --> 21:35.674
This is a report.

21:35.675 --> 21:37.439
What happened
to the solar system?

21:37.440 --> 21:39.023
That was just a fake out.

21:39.024 --> 21:42.009
The real project was to make up
a theory and prove it.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.869
"Corey Baxter's
Theory of Relativity"?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.034
And I proved it.

21:46.035 --> 21:48.004
Relatives-- that's you--

21:48.005 --> 21:51.231
will always protect
their young-- that's me.

21:52.510 --> 21:53.956
I feel used.

21:53.957 --> 21:55.265
That's bad.

21:55.266 --> 21:56.891
But proud.

21:56.892 --> 21:57.958
That's good!

21:58.975 --> 22:00.004
I'll get it.

22:01.365 --> 22:02.418
Mom?

22:02.419 --> 22:04.409
If it's a fish, don't answer it.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.129
Oh, Raven.
