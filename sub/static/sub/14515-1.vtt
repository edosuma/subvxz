WEBVTT

02:31.902 --> 02:35.327
- I stand before you, gentlemen,

02:36.156 --> 02:40.117
as a lecturer in anatomy, a scientist,

02:40.118 --> 02:44.580
a specialist, a material man,

02:44.581 --> 02:48.677
to whom the heart, for instance,
is an elaborate physical organ

02:48.678 --> 02:52.546
and not the seat of love,
a man to whom the soul,

02:52.547 --> 02:58.594
because it has no shape,
does not exist.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.682
But paradox is inherent in all dogma,

03:02.683 --> 03:06.560
so I stand before you, also,
as a man of sentiment.

03:06.561 --> 03:10.815
And it is in my dual capacity...
As scientist and sociologist,

03:10.816 --> 03:15.486
materialist and moralist,
anatomist and artist...

03:15.487 --> 03:18.239
That I intend to conduct my lectures,

03:18.240 --> 03:22.660
to expound,
inform, illustrate, entertain...

03:22.661 --> 03:25.039
and edify.

03:29.167 --> 03:34.672
The noble profession, at whose threshold
you stand as neophytes,

03:34.673 --> 03:37.550
is not an end in itself.

03:37.551 --> 03:42.263
The science of anatomy contributes
to the great sum of all knowledge,

03:42.264 --> 03:46.183
and I believe that all men
must work towards that end,

03:46.184 --> 03:52.112
and I believe that that end
justifies any means.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.405
- Come on! Out of my door!
Move yourself!

03:59.406 --> 04:01.282
And don't come back!

04:01.283 --> 04:04.827
- Rags for sale!
- Human hair!

04:04.828 --> 04:07.288
- Rags for sale!

04:15.046 --> 04:18.425
- Dead skins, dead skins,
human hair.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.931
Get up. Go on.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.231
- Billy! Where are ya, Billy?

04:34.232 --> 04:35.449
Here!

04:36.693 --> 04:38.661
You watch the stuff, Billy.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.437
- How much they give you, Billy, huh?
- What you got there, boy?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.639
Ow!

05:06.640 --> 05:08.358
Hey, hey.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.455
- Cut her dead.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.505
- To Dr. Rock and his academy.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.091
- Aah! Whoa!

05:42.092 --> 05:44.470
- Buy us a little drink, Nelly, darling.

05:44.471 --> 05:48.315
- Buy a drink for Fallon and Broom, eh?
- Buy youse a drink? With what?

05:48.316 --> 05:52.476
- Let's have your bottom drink.
- It's not the bottoms yet!

05:52.477 --> 05:54.898
Ah, leave him be, Nelly.

05:54.899 --> 05:57.490
He'll bite your hand right through,
I knows him.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.611
Well, go on, have 'em.
Have the bottoms.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.081
- Give us a drink in there.
Put some in there, will ya?

06:05.082 --> 06:06.791
Good man, good man.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.079
To our benefactors.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.458
To Dr. Rock.

06:17.085 --> 06:22.091
- Who would them three be in the corner
there with all that money for a drink?

06:22.092 --> 06:25.094
- Andrew Merry-Lees,
Praying Howard, and Mole.

06:25.095 --> 06:27.344
- Hmm, they're never short.

06:27.345 --> 06:31.432
What now would they be doing
for a living, lovey?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.231
- Grave robbers.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.021
- Who's this Dr. Rock?
- He buys the stuff.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.647
- What stuff?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.025
- Bodies.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.486
- Bodies?

06:46.907 --> 06:47.907
- Get out.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.796
I'll go this way.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.082
- Where'd they go, Billy?
Where'd they go?

06:57.083 --> 06:58.459
- Leave him alone, brute.
Leave him.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.253
He won't know nothing.
Don't hurt him.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.382
- Did you see him? The men three
with the horse and carriage.

07:03.383 --> 07:05.725
- We saw nothing, have we, Billy?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.052
- Ah, to hell with ya!

07:08.053 --> 07:10.556
You have the same dark brains
as your brother!

07:10.557 --> 07:13.729
- It runs in the family! You're all bloody mad!
- Oi, mate!

07:24.736 --> 07:27.239
- Come on, youse.
- No, no! No, not here!

07:27.240 --> 07:30.741
It's too bloody cold.
Come on, let's go back to Rose's.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.706
- Who you got there, Jennie, huh?

07:32.707 --> 07:35.204
- Piss off, Fallon, I've got a customer.
- Oh.

07:35.205 --> 07:39.124
Did you see the three of them?
Uh, Andrew what's-his-name and Mole.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.004
- I ain't seen no one. Now, let me be.
Me and my friend are going to Rose's.

07:42.005 --> 07:43.801
- You heard what the lady said.

07:43.802 --> 07:46.674
Shut your mouth now!

07:46.675 --> 07:48.723
Where'd you see them, eh?
Were they on the cart, eh?

07:48.724 --> 07:50.641
- I seen nothing, Fallon.

07:50.642 --> 07:53.013
- Quick, Fallon, we seen 'em.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.307
Oh!

07:55.308 --> 07:57.768
Hee hee!

07:57.769 --> 07:59.565
- Here, no, Jennie, come on, now, huh?

07:59.566 --> 08:03.112
I'll be back, with money enough
to have you naked, huh?

08:05.944 --> 08:09.790
Come on, Fallon!

08:22.043 --> 08:25.172
- That bloody watchman
has got himself sober again!

08:27.590 --> 08:30.639
All right, Jimmy, I know what you want.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.647
Here, Jimmy.
What do you see now, Jimmy?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.902
- Now I can see nothing.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.253
- Have you found him yet?
- Here he is.

08:56.254 --> 08:58.212
- Hallelujah. Go to it, Mole.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.259
- Quiet as death tonight.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.508
Praise be the Lord.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.089
- It's a hard clasp
they've put on the coffin.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.218
- The unbelievers.
- Break it open then.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.058
This cold's got into my bones.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.097
Easy! Don't hurt him!

09:18.644 --> 09:19.892
- No, I couldn't hear nothing.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.477
Careful.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.775
- The rope.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.579
- The horse.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.288
- Quick. Give us a hand, Mole.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.132
There!

09:49.297 --> 09:52.674
- Daisy! Daisy!

09:52.675 --> 09:55.679
Come back here, Daisy!

09:56.721 --> 09:58.473
- Daisy, Daisy!

09:59.557 --> 10:01.651
- Whacking the horse, huh?

10:12.654 --> 10:13.654
Shh!

10:19.619 --> 10:20.953
- Now hold the rear.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.753
- Whoa!
- Now, stay there, Daisy.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.421
- Where's the bloody body?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.468
- We left it here!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.133
It's gone!

10:34.134 --> 10:37.012
- Where?
- Well, he can't have run away, can he?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.859
Oh, gin and pies, gin and pies.

10:46.860 --> 10:48.778
Here we are.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.650
- Dr. Rock, Dr. Rock.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.534
- Mr. Murray?

11:00.535 --> 11:02.412
Mr. Murray, sir?

11:04.414 --> 11:06.337
They're here, sir. But...

11:06.791 --> 11:10.002
- But what?
- I think you'd better come, sir.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.504
It's not who we expected, sir.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.132
I've never seen them before.
They're new hands.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.103
- And the goods they brought?
- Oh, they say the goods is fresh, sir.

11:18.104 --> 11:19.266
Or nearly fresh.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.057
- Don't look, don't look, don't look.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.318
- This isn't fresh.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.398
Dr. Rock won't like this.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.242
He may as well dissect a dog
dragged from the river

11:33.243 --> 11:34.985
after the fishes have been at it.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.321
Dr. Rock needs fresh bodies.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.666
- Going to pay them, sir?
- Only half.

11:41.326 --> 11:45.412
- Three sovereigns, no more.
Seven when it's fresh.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.413
Now get out.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.922
- Good night.
- 'Night.

11:54.005 --> 11:57.096
- Three guineas!
Three guineas for an old man!

11:57.097 --> 11:59.310
- I know. It's a shame
he wasn't a young one, then?

11:59.886 --> 12:01.762
- Oh, look at that, look at that!
- Give it here.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.263
- Get off! Get off!

12:03.264 --> 12:05.232
Whoo hoo hoo!

12:06.809 --> 12:08.852
Drinks for everybody!

12:08.853 --> 12:10.604
Drinks for everybody!
- You want 'em?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.232
- Hey, what're you up to?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.826
- We paid for them!
- Hey, get over, darling.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.424
- Stop it, now, Fallon!
There's nothing left!

12:35.425 --> 12:37.092
- Go away! Go drink your bottle.

12:37.093 --> 12:39.889
We've money enough
to piss this stuff away.

12:39.890 --> 12:43.354
- Is there some in there?
Ah!

12:44.389 --> 12:46.437
Stop it there!
Hey, whatcha doing?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.028
- Here, have a drink.

12:50.029 --> 12:52.192
There, how's that? Eh?

12:58.653 --> 12:59.861
Hey, Broom.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.956
Broom, you forgot something.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.706
Forgot to drink to our benefactor.

13:10.999 --> 13:14.094
To our benefactors. To the dead.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.765
- I always say to Dr. Rock, “If the last
thump should suddenly sound,

13:22.766 --> 13:26.390
these specimens should be in perfect
condition and meet their maker.”

13:27.473 --> 13:29.754
You're almost as pickled as he is, Tom.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.528
- Who is going to share a drink
with a country gentleman, huh?

13:35.529 --> 13:38.567
Have a drop with me.
There you go, eh? Whoo!

13:38.568 --> 13:40.364
Jennie, will you have a drink
with me now?

13:40.365 --> 13:42.614
- I never drink with strangers
'cept on Mondays.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.783
- Isn't today Monday, huh?

13:46.784 --> 13:50.787
And the stars are shining.
And the bells are chiming.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.878
We'll... We'll drink to Monday, huh?

13:52.879 --> 13:54.545
Here you go, and Tuesday.

13:54.546 --> 13:57.294
- Oh, I never drink twice
with strangers before 12:00.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.588
And isn't it up to 12:00 now?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.131
Huh? -

14:29.577 --> 14:31.955
- Come on! Hurry.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.712
- Good morning, Billy.
- Good mornin'.

14:35.713 --> 14:38.382
- Come on! Hup! Come on!

14:41.422 --> 14:42.924
Look out!

14:44.050 --> 14:46.343
- Aaah! Aaah!

14:46.344 --> 14:48.597
- Stop, stop!

15:00.149 --> 15:02.734
Careful! Gently!

15:05.905 --> 15:08.249
- We'll take him to the academy.
- I'll get Dr. Thornton.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.992
Easy, easy.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.635
- And clean away the blood, Joseph.

15:23.636 --> 15:27.431
Clean it off as quickly as possible.
- Right, Dr. Thornton. Brandy here. Quick.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.015
- Now, come on now.
Open your mouth, come. That's it.

15:32.016 --> 15:34.062
A nice little bit of brandy. Come on.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.685
There, there.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.700
- What do you think, Harding?
Is the femur broken?

15:42.701 --> 15:45.152
- Can't say so. Too much blood.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.243
But we should cut the leg off at the hip.

15:47.244 --> 15:49.953
- Let's try for once not to be
butchers in frock coats.

15:49.954 --> 15:53.294
I'm going in to have a look.
How's the boy, Joseph?

15:53.295 --> 15:56.204
- Come on, and again. Good boy.

15:57.999 --> 16:01.960
 There was this old woman
who lived in a shoe 

16:10.344 --> 16:12.767
- The major artery's been severed.
- I can't see.

16:12.768 --> 16:13.980
Tourniquet!

16:15.391 --> 16:18.235
- Get Dr. Rock!
Quickly, get Dr. Rock!

16:31.324 --> 16:34.077
- Thomas, thank God! He's bleeding
to death. I can't find the artery.

16:34.078 --> 16:35.997
Another tourniquet.

16:35.998 --> 16:37.497
You've got it on the wrong artery.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.553
There.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.756
Pull. Tight.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.271
Tighter.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.854
There. Do you see?

17:01.562 --> 17:06.693
- It's the superficial
circumflex iliac artery.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.576
- You didn't know about that one,
did you, Harding?

17:11.577 --> 17:14.074
You thought it was the femoral.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.998
Good. The bleeding's stopped.

17:15.999 --> 17:17.493
Start stitching.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.667
You'll be all right now, Billy.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.175
- Smaller stitches, for God sake, Harry.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.386
You're not repairing an old boot.
It's a human artery.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.971
- How the deuce did you
discover that artery?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.969
- Knowledge, Harry.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.847
You were taught anatomy
by self-satisfied pompous idiots,

17:37.848 --> 17:40.475
who cared more about morality
than medicine.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.106
- Macklin is the most distinguished
professor of anatomy at the University.

17:44.107 --> 17:46.153
- He was senile before he reached puberty.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.486
The whole medical reputation
of this city is consigned to a man

17:51.487 --> 17:53.410
who reads his grandfather's
lectures for his own

17:53.411 --> 17:56.376
and dissects
like a laborer with a pick ax.

17:57.785 --> 18:01.083
Harry, do you realize the progress
that could be made in medicine

18:01.084 --> 18:02.956
if we were to be given free access...

18:02.957 --> 18:05.460
- To what?
- Teaching material. Bodies.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.460
- But the law says...

18:07.461 --> 18:11.216
- The law says that you as a surgeon
must possess a high degree of skill.

18:11.217 --> 18:13.343
How are you to obtain that skill?

18:13.344 --> 18:16.721
By mangling the living,
like we nearly did with Billy Bedlam?

18:18.848 --> 18:20.187
Look at these hands, Harry.

18:20.188 --> 18:22.604
Do you agree they're talented?
- Undoubtedly.

18:22.605 --> 18:24.696
- But what good are they handcuffed?

18:24.697 --> 18:27.657
Bound by ridiculous laws
that shackle them?

18:29.233 --> 18:30.572
I am only allowed, by law,

18:30.573 --> 18:33.240
to dissect the corpses
of hanged criminals.

18:33.241 --> 18:35.786
Do you know what my quota is
if I'm lucky? Five!

18:37.408 --> 18:41.625
Apart from that, I have to make due
with desiccated, shriveled,

18:41.626 --> 18:45.842
rotting cadavers that the maggots
find out more about than I ever will.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.550
The law must be changed.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.174
- Hey, you, we've been here hours!

18:54.175 --> 18:56.098
Nobody tells you a bloody thing
in this place.

18:56.099 --> 18:58.261
We wanna know how Billy is!

18:58.262 --> 19:01.353
- Billy's my brother.
- Yeah, and I'm a friend, Jennie Bailey.

19:01.354 --> 19:04.271
- Is Billy still alive?
What are they doing to him?

19:04.272 --> 19:07.317
- He's been very lucky.
He's been attended by Dr. Rock.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.192
- Dr. Rock?
- Oh. Oh, God.

19:12.193 --> 19:16.071
Dr. Rock's the one that cuts 'em up.
Billy's dead.

19:16.072 --> 19:20.871
- On the contrary. Dr. Rock not only saved
your brother's life, he saved his leg.

19:20.872 --> 19:24.334
- He didn't cut Billy's leg off?
But we thought for sure...

19:24.335 --> 19:27.630
- Who are you, anyway?
- I'm Dr. Rock's assistant.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.799
- Come on, Alice, let's get out of here.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.139
Let's go back to Pig's Lane
where we can breathe.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.427
- Thank you.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.500
- Good evening, sir.
- Shh.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.755
- Ms. Rock wishes to speak with you.
- Thank you, Molly.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.479
- Good evening, Thomas.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.358
Thomas, can you spare me
a moment of your time?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.394
- A hundred, my dear Annabella.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.563
All my time is at your disposal.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.817
- I've something important to discuss.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.278
I'm arranging a small
dinner party for you.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.446
- For me?

20:39.447 --> 20:45.952
- It may very well be the last,
if what I hear in the city is true.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.372
- I smell vinegar in here tonight.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.713
- Will you look at these invitations?

20:51.714 --> 20:53.928
Because I may have forgotten someone.

20:53.929 --> 20:56.172
- A fortunate someone.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.801
- There's no need to be contemptuous
of the celebration

20:59.802 --> 21:02.349
that's been planned in your own honor.

21:04.305 --> 21:07.102
I hear the medical faculty's
going to investigate you.

21:07.103 --> 21:09.896
Your whole professional life
may be at stake.

21:09.897 --> 21:12.397
- Look, why aren't
Dr. and Mrs. Gordon invited?

21:12.398 --> 21:16.608
- Mrs. Gordon won't sit
at table with “her.”

21:16.609 --> 21:19.068
- My wife.
- I could never understand

21:19.069 --> 21:21.117
why you didn't keep that girl
somewhere as your mistress,

21:21.118 --> 21:25.084
instead of bringing her here to this house,
legalizing your shabbyamours.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.796
No self-respecting person would be
willing to sit in the presence

21:31.797 --> 21:35.710
of a woman who draws
those... vile,

21:35.711 --> 21:38.797
obscene drawings.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.971
- Elizabeth works for me
under my instructions.

21:40.972 --> 21:43.515
- They're filthy, disgusting.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.446
- Thomas.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.530
- Is this the place
where I can see nude drawings?

21:59.531 --> 22:03.873
- You've been speaking to your sister.
Now you're losing your temper again.

22:03.874 --> 22:07.951
- No. Society has been losing
its temper with me.

22:07.952 --> 22:11.412
- Society? That's a lot of people.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.503
Be careful. They're your friends.

22:13.504 --> 22:15.968
- I don't need any friends.
I prefer enemies.

22:16.794 --> 22:20.014
They're better company, and their feelings
toward you are always genuine.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.975
Thomas, don't be angry.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.494
- Thomas, what is it?

22:46.282 --> 22:48.626
Have I drawn something incorrectly?

22:51.954 --> 22:53.080
- No.

22:53.914 --> 22:58.340
It's just that it reminds me
of... someone I love.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.460
Open that door, Rosie!

23:35.461 --> 23:37.504
- All right, all right. I'm coming.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.215
Yes?
- ls this where Jennie Bailey lives?

23:42.216 --> 23:44.802
- Who wants her?
- My name's Dr. Murray.

23:44.803 --> 23:46.218
- Oh, come in, come in.

23:46.219 --> 23:48.343
Nice to see one of my girls
going up in the world.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.553
Jennie? She might be busy.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.096
Come in. Jennie?

23:52.097 --> 23:55.144
Whatever you're doing, stop it.
There's a gentleman here to see you.

23:55.145 --> 23:57.816
- I don't know any gentleman.
- Come on, girl.

23:57.817 --> 24:00.897
- Oh, he's no gentleman, he's a doctor.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.117
There's no dead bodies here.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.027
- You left your shawl at the academy
last week.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.862
- Oh, we thought
someone had nicked it.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.787
It's only half mine. The other half belongs
to Alice. We take turns wearing it.

24:10.788 --> 24:13.248
- I hope tonight it's your turn.
- Yeah.

24:13.249 --> 24:17.080
I'd like to thank you for it, know
what I mean? But Rosie's very strict.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.957
Still, if you've got two bob
we can go in back.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.337
- Good night.
- I didn't... I didn't come here to...

24:22.338 --> 24:25.215
I just wanted to see you.
- My time costs you two bob.

24:25.216 --> 24:28.093
She grabs nine pence,
but I'll take off all my clothes.

24:28.094 --> 24:30.468
- Here's a sovereign.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.722
- Sovereign?
How long do you want me for, a week?

24:32.723 --> 24:35.139
- I just want to talk to you.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.313
- Just talk?
- Come on.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.065
I'm paying for your time.

24:39.066 --> 24:42.065
- Wish I could find someone
that only wanted to talk.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.328
- Will you stop that coughing,
you miserable little swine?

24:52.329 --> 24:54.577
- Get up and pay us
the rent you owe us.

24:57.037 --> 25:01.791
- Seven sovereigns they give
for a corpse when its dug up new.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.918
Seven sovereigns.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.138
- Seven sovereigns
for gin and pies, then?

25:06.139 --> 25:08.840
- You mad dog!

25:08.841 --> 25:13.052
- Nelly, eh, scrape up a penny
or two for a drop for us?

25:13.053 --> 25:15.054
Huh? Come on.
There's plenty of ways, lovey.

25:15.055 --> 25:18.935
- Why don't you dig one up yourself?
You're frightened of the dark.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.734
- Fresh berries. Fresh berries.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.780
- Knives to grind.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.821
- You're still seeing that Dr. Murray, then?
- Yeah.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.916
- Why do you treat him so badly, Jen?

25:37.917 --> 25:40.458
- Oh, but, Alice, I'm so very fond of him.

25:40.459 --> 25:43.046
I like him better than any man
in the whole world.

25:43.047 --> 25:46.127
- Then why do you carry on in front of his eyes?
- I don't, I don't.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.551
- Letting him see you walk out
with any Tom, Dick, and Harry.

25:48.552 --> 25:52.017
- I don't know any Harry.
- Oh, Jen.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.975
- What do you want?
- Can we feel your tits for a penny?

25:55.976 --> 25:58.349
Oh! Let's see the penny.

26:01.393 --> 26:06.365
Go on! Go waste your money
on somebody else!

26:08.817 --> 26:13.321
- Look at those drunken sods,
not a penny to their names.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.782
I warned 'em, I begged 'em.

26:15.783 --> 26:20.125
If they'd bottled all the stars in heaven,
they'd piss it away in a night.

26:20.126 --> 26:22.794
- Nelly, Nelly.
Give us a kiss, darling.

26:22.795 --> 26:25.208
Oh, your breath stinks of gin.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.257
Where the hell did you get the money
to pay for that?

26:27.258 --> 26:30.051
- New lodgers, that's how.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.424
Rents in advance, that's how!

26:33.425 --> 26:36.053
- Hey, you poxy cur, what about us?

26:37.262 --> 26:39.936
- Seven sovereigns, he said.
- Yeah.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.273
- Seven sovereigns.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.525
- Fresh, he says.
Seven sovereigns for fresh.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.986
Fresh in here, Fallon.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.580
Now fresh in here.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.880
- Oh, Daniel.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.758
Eh?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.636
Have the rent you owe us, Daniel?

27:10.796 --> 27:13.424
Eh? Five shillings you owe us now.
Do you have the money?

27:13.425 --> 27:16.384
- Ah, he's worth more to us dead.

27:24.852 --> 27:29.449
- Do you remember them days
in the war, Broom? And the militia?

27:34.778 --> 27:37.327
Hospital orderlies Fallon and Broom, eh?

27:37.614 --> 27:40.658
God, how I loved them days.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.787
- Hey, do you remember the boys
they brought in from the field

27:42.788 --> 27:45.130
with their arms
and their legs shot away, huh?

27:45.914 --> 27:48.508
Holes in their stomachs
the size of the moon.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.347
Them surgeons
were kind, clever men, eh?

27:57.846 --> 28:01.313
Wait, Fallon, wait. Wait, wait.

28:02.139 --> 28:05.643
- “Put them out of their misery, Mr.
Fallon,” That's what the major said to me.

28:05.644 --> 28:09.103
For God's sake, Fallon, wait.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.072
Let's take, let's take.

28:11.073 --> 28:15.740
- There's nothing we can do for these poor
boys, except save them from further pain.

28:15.741 --> 28:17.784
That's what the surgeon said.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.744
And here's Daniel,
all alone in the world.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.289
Huh? Not a soul...

28:26.788 --> 28:28.756
and this terrible coughing.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.553
It's an act of kindness
we're doing him, Broom.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.467
- Is he dead?

28:41.094 --> 28:42.391
- You better try him.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.273
- He's dead.
- And fresh, Broom.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.527
Fresh as new moon hay.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.118
Come on, open up, eh?

29:06.119 --> 29:08.829
Come on, come on.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.390
- Come in. Walk quiet.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.904
- No, walk quiet, Broom, eh?

29:50.664 --> 29:53.258
Oh, it's a blessing
we've given him, huh?

29:55.043 --> 29:57.592
- And he's fresh, Fallon.

30:04.678 --> 30:05.850
- Pay them.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.181
- Seven.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.605
- Who are they, Tom?
- Uh, this one's...

30:11.606 --> 30:14.354
- I'm Robert Fallon, sir.
- Broom, sir.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.950
- This is the best material
I've had in years.

30:23.697 --> 30:27.577
- Son of God, hear me.
Deliver from evil my brother Thomas.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.454
Deliver him from evil company.

30:31.455 --> 30:35.050
Help him to heal with hands
in God's service

30:36.418 --> 30:39.968
and let not those hands
be used in foulness,

30:40.756 --> 30:45.307
for the sake of what the Devil
has made him think is progress.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.125
- Thank you for coming.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.137
It is not often remarked on
that it was Herophilos

31:20.138 --> 31:25.091
who first traced the arachnoid membrane
into the ventricles of the brain.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.093
What is known, however,

31:27.094 --> 31:31.305
and what I have told you
repeatedly in these lectures...

31:33.225 --> 31:39.313
- And so, gentlemen, once again,
I am forced to apologize.

31:39.314 --> 31:44.195
As you know, I've long since passed my quota
of subjects delivered by the hangman.

31:44.196 --> 31:49.872
And so, today we will have
to make do with the carcass of a sheep.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.841
Frederick. - Sir?

31:59.543 --> 32:02.586
- Identify.
- Kidney, sir.

32:02.587 --> 32:03.679
- Function?

32:04.381 --> 32:07.385
- To separate from the blood
certain impure materials,

32:07.386 --> 32:09.430
which when dissolved in
a quantity of water,

32:09.431 --> 32:12.100
also separated by the kidneys
from the blood,

32:12.101 --> 32:14.566
constitute the urine
in the human organism.

32:14.567 --> 32:16.026
- Excellent.

32:16.852 --> 32:22.022
Except for one minor detail...
Not in the human organism,

32:22.023 --> 32:24.859
but in the organism of the...

32:24.860 --> 32:27.194
- Sheep!

32:27.195 --> 32:30.825
- Let us now, gentlemen,
reaffirm our creed.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.834
The study of anatomy is absolutely vital...

32:44.463 --> 32:48.764
- And, of course, sir, he said
they were the kidneys of a sheep.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.765
- A sheep?

32:53.930 --> 32:55.807
How dare he?

32:57.684 --> 33:01.109
He makes a laughingstock
of the whole medical profession.

33:02.522 --> 33:06.400
He's a pernicious influence, pernicious.

33:06.401 --> 33:11.655
A corruptor of youth! Thank you, Cronin,
for bringing this to my attention.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.830
- I shall go to all his lectures, sir,
and report back to you.

33:14.831 --> 33:17.545
- Yes, yes, the man must be stopped.

33:18.413 --> 33:22.875
I shall put these... sheep's kidneys

33:22.876 --> 33:25.095
before the medical faculty in the morning.

33:26.046 --> 33:29.550
I shall confront them
with the incontrovertible proof

33:29.551 --> 33:32.843
that Dr. Thomas Rock
has access to bodies

33:32.844 --> 33:35.097
that do not come from the hangman.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.435
- Legally, the hangman is our one provider,

33:39.436 --> 33:41.727
but he'd have to hang all
the liars in the city

33:41.728 --> 33:45.153
and all the men that are unfaithful to their wives
before there'd be sufficient subjects for us.

33:45.154 --> 33:47.945
- You make our city
sound like Sodom and Gomorrah.

33:47.946 --> 33:51.698
- If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I must
try to brave this terrible city at night.

33:55.408 --> 33:59.038
- If you dislike the law
that applies to your own science,

33:59.663 --> 34:02.507
why did you become an anatomist
rather than anything else?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.335
- There was more “body” to it.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.674
- We can use a pint now, lord.

34:11.675 --> 34:15.475
- Look at Jennie Bailey, the lady,
drinking with a doctor.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.857
- I'd like to put my nails in her eyes.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.230
- Why can't we meet
in another place sometimes, Jennie?

34:23.231 --> 34:27.449
Anywhere else but this damn tavern with
all the sluts and drunks staring at us?

34:28.358 --> 34:31.487
- You know you can come back with me.
- And you know that I won't.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.152
I can't.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.619
Don't you understand,
I couldn't go back there.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.036
Not there to that house.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.333
I don't want to think about the others

34:39.335 --> 34:41.045
and your smiling at them
and letting them...

34:41.045 --> 34:45.213
- The others don't mean a thing in the wide
world. They're different. I'm for you.

34:45.214 --> 34:47.126
Come back now.

34:47.127 --> 34:50.130
I'll tell Rosie that you're staying and...
- No.

34:50.132 --> 34:52.974
No, Jennie, please.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.219
Oh, you're beautiful. Come away.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.471
Come away from everything here.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.191
- Oh, a fine young doctor's lady I'd make.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.815
“Oh, from what part
do you come, Mrs. Murray?”

35:04.816 --> 35:08.486
“Oh, number three Pig's Yard.
Your husband used to call on Wednesdays.”

35:15.488 --> 35:18.907
- There. You're doing well. That's a boy.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.785
- Hello, Billy.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.128
I think you're well enough
to go home now, Billy.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.382
Tom will get you a cab. It's too cold
to be running about in the streets.

35:33.383 --> 35:36.842
Here's a present for you, boy.
- Hey.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.642
- Now, hold it in your hand.
Don't lose it.

35:39.643 --> 35:40.855
- Thank you.

35:45.810 --> 35:50.532
- And now he'll hurry as fast as he can
on his bent bones to the nearest tavern

35:50.533 --> 35:54.869
and fuddle his few poor wits
and crack his crazed little jokes,

35:55.945 --> 35:57.947
half remembered from the cradle.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.368
Oh, how the pious
would lift their hands to heaven

36:02.369 --> 36:05.964
to think of a man giving money to an idiot
so that he could get drunk

36:06.956 --> 36:10.959
and be warm and happy
for an hour or two.

36:24.224 --> 36:28.143
 Just breathe my name
to the woodlands 

36:31.981 --> 36:36.110
 I know I shall hear
your message, dear 

37:11.980 --> 37:14.153
- Lovely, Jen, lovely.
- Good girl.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.504
- Enter.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.384
- A urgent message for Dr. Rock
from the Faculty of Medicine, sir.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.264
- Thank you.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.895
- What do the Board want to talk to you
about this time?

37:54.898 --> 37:58.994
- Dr. Rock, would you please
identify the contents of this jar.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.455
- Kidneys, sir.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.254
- Kidneys.

38:16.836 --> 38:21.182
- From the size I would say male kidneys,
weighing approximately six ounces.

38:21.183 --> 38:22.721
- From what animal?

38:25.011 --> 38:28.606
- The human animal.
- Do these kidneys belong to you?

38:28.607 --> 38:31.475
- Yes and no.
- What do you mean by that?

38:31.476 --> 38:36.198
- I mean that they belong to me,
but they're not mine. I keep mine here.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.071
- Yes, I take your point, Dr. Rock.

38:39.776 --> 38:43.622
But may I remind you that these specimens
were used by you in a lecture

38:43.623 --> 38:46.281
and described as sheep's kidneys.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.908
- Yes.
- Why?

38:47.909 --> 38:50.412
Why did you not describe them correctly?

38:50.413 --> 38:52.162
Why did you resort to deceit?

38:52.163 --> 38:53.539
- Well, I would've thought
that it was self-evident,

38:53.540 --> 38:56.419
since my quota of subjects
from the hangman has long since run out.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.761
If I am to continue my work,

38:59.462 --> 39:01.383
human bodies
must be obtained illegally.

39:01.384 --> 39:03.930
- So you admit it?
You admit that you break the law.

39:03.931 --> 39:09.054
- I admit to breaking any law
that inhibits the progress of science.

39:09.055 --> 39:13.435
- Dr. Rock, do you also admit to condoning the
removal of bodies from consecrated earth?

39:13.436 --> 39:16.186
And by dissecting them,
prevent their resurrection

39:16.187 --> 39:18.856
whole and perfect on Judgment Day,

39:18.857 --> 39:20.732
as decreed by Jesus Christ?

39:20.733 --> 39:23.402
- Dr. Mackendrick, do you really believe

39:23.403 --> 39:26.118
that all the poor devils blown to bits
on all the battlefields

39:26.119 --> 39:28.535
in all the senseless wars,
since the beginning of time,

39:28.536 --> 39:30.748
will be barred from entering
the Kingdom of Heaven

39:30.749 --> 39:32.586
because their limbs cannot be found?

39:32.587 --> 39:36.039
I cannot believe your God
can be so cruel.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.880
- Why are you being facetious, sir?

39:37.881 --> 39:40.591
- I, too, sir, am in the
business of anatomy,

39:40.592 --> 39:44.467
but I acquire my knowledge
professionally, not by breaking the law.

39:44.468 --> 39:46.383
- The law be damned!

39:46.384 --> 39:48.974
The law is not only
ridiculous, it's obsolete.

39:48.975 --> 39:53.567
We have to drag anatomy and medicine out of
the dark ages into the 19th Century for...

39:54.100 --> 39:56.476
We are scientists, for God's sake,

39:56.477 --> 40:00.323
not self-serving model hypocrites
and penny pill-pushers.

40:01.065 --> 40:04.865
It is our duty to improve
the quality of human life.

40:21.169 --> 40:24.796
- Oh, Jennie. Oh, Jennie.

40:24.797 --> 40:27.799
Oh, Jennie, I love you.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.223
You've gotta forgive me.
I love you.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.527
When can I see you again?

40:52.325 --> 40:54.743
Buy yourself something nice, Jennie.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.872
- No, I don't want your money.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.815
See for yourself, Harry.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.147
They were men and women once.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.655
- Please, mister.
- Please, uh, move aside.

41:28.656 --> 41:33.329
- No, I'm not here on the game. See, you
saved my brother Billy's leg, and...

41:33.330 --> 41:36.168
And see, I... I just wanted to thank you.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.749
- Look, I appreciate your thanks,
but, really, I... I can't accept a gift.

41:40.750 --> 41:43.625
- Please. I know it's not worth much.

41:43.626 --> 41:46.505
I think if you was to pawn it,
you would get more than sixpence for it.

41:46.506 --> 41:49.676
But it's of value to me,
and I'd like you to have it.

41:49.677 --> 41:52.052
- Really, I... I can't.
- Thank you for what you done.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.429
Billy's walking ever so well now.

42:05.106 --> 42:07.450
- Aren't people extraordinary?

42:23.666 --> 42:26.260
- Have another drink.
Have another drink.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.339
- Come on now.
- That's the stuff.

42:29.340 --> 42:31.089
- He said come on.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.467
That'll do you good.

42:36.429 --> 42:37.897
- Come on, now.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.736
- Ha ha! We brought you
a little present, girls.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.705
- What have you got now,
you drunken sods.

42:54.706 --> 42:57.324
- Look what we brought ya...
a poor old gentleman

42:57.325 --> 43:00.704
with nowhere to sleep,
nowhere to sleep but with us.

43:04.707 --> 43:08.086
- Away with your bother. Have your
money ready. We'll be back, huh?

43:09.629 --> 43:11.802
- Oh, now we've money enough
for the boards.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.349
- Another one delivered this evening, sir.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.643
Fallon and Broom again, sir.

43:19.644 --> 43:23.141
Must be their seventh, maybe their eighth.

43:23.142 --> 43:26.191
- Did you pay them?
- Seven sovereigns, sir.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.075
But it's fresh. They're always fresh.

43:32.443 --> 43:35.117
Not even the smell of the grave on it.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.966
Come on, come on!

44:02.807 --> 44:04.558
- I won, I won!

44:04.559 --> 44:06.977
- Ah, God bless the little fella!

44:12.650 --> 44:15.073
- I won! I won, I won, I won!

44:15.570 --> 44:18.238
- God bless the little bastard!

44:18.239 --> 44:21.658
Well, what did I tell ya, huh?

44:21.659 --> 44:23.910
- You know your birds.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.084
I'll say that for ya,
you know your birds.

44:26.085 --> 44:30.301
- Next fight.
The black cock Brooks Fancy.

44:30.751 --> 44:33.795
The white cock...

44:33.796 --> 44:35.844
- Now here's your chance
to make a real killing.

44:36.549 --> 44:39.723
- A real killing, huh?
A real killing, huh?

44:39.724 --> 44:41.720
We've done that before, eh?

44:41.721 --> 44:44.349
- Shut it, Fallon.
- The white one, the white one.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.397
- The white one,
do you see him over there?

44:47.398 --> 44:51.068
That white cock has won six straight
and not a feather out of place.

44:51.898 --> 44:53.195
Put the lot on him.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.735
- Alas, all of it on the white one?

44:56.736 --> 45:00.077
- Didn't Mr. Fallon here say I know my birds.
- He did, he did, he did.

45:00.078 --> 45:03.292
- I'm telling you the white one is
the cock of the north. He can't be beat.

45:05.286 --> 45:06.788
- What do you think, Fallon?

45:07.413 --> 45:09.414
- Ah, let's do the lot, huh? All of it.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.962
All of it on the cock of the north, eh?
- Hurry, come on.

45:11.963 --> 45:15.964
- This will make you rich, my friends.
Rich. Cock of the north.

45:15.965 --> 45:17.886
- Brooks Fancy. Ha!
- Two p's on the black.

45:17.887 --> 45:20.351
- Fight.

45:25.681 --> 45:28.228
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on, come on!

45:28.229 --> 45:29.819
- Go on, my beauty, that's it!

45:29.820 --> 45:32.395
Go on, get him!
- Go on, get him!

45:32.396 --> 45:33.772
- Come on!

45:33.773 --> 45:36.743
- Go on in, that's right. Go on, get him.
- Come on, come on!

45:36.744 --> 45:39.152
Come on! Come on!

45:39.153 --> 45:40.904
- Get him!
- Kill him!

45:47.828 --> 45:50.798
- Ha ha! Ha ha ha! He's winning!

45:52.291 --> 45:56.211
- Come on, kill!
- Get up, get up!

45:56.212 --> 45:58.715
- Yeah! Kill, kill!
- Kill him, you bastard!

45:58.716 --> 46:00.590
- Kill him!
- Come on, get up, get up!

46:00.591 --> 46:03.593
- Get up, get up!
- That's it, yes! Go on!

46:03.594 --> 46:05.637
You've got him. Yay!

46:05.638 --> 46:08.016
- He's dead, he's dead, he's dead, huh?
- Yay!

46:17.441 --> 46:20.069
- Gentlemen, gentlemen, what can I say?

46:20.903 --> 46:22.701
- Oh, ya bastard!
- Fallon!

46:23.656 --> 46:24.908
- I'll kill ya, swine!

46:24.909 --> 46:26.534
- Not here.

46:27.743 --> 46:29.040
Not now.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.884
- O'Connor, you're a bastard.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.600
- We'd like the money.
- I haven't got the money.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.679
- Go through his pockets.

46:47.513 --> 46:50.483
- Two sovereigns.

46:53.269 --> 46:56.113
- Come on, out!

47:01.652 --> 47:03.700
- Dr. Rock.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.950
- You knock at the door
very softly, Mr. Murray.

47:08.409 --> 47:12.835
- Last night I saw Fallon and Broom
plying an old man, a derelict, with gin.

47:13.497 --> 47:16.875
Now that same man has been delivered
to this academy by Fallon and Broom.

47:16.876 --> 47:17.959
He is dead.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.213
- Well, the way they swill that gut rot,
I'm not surprised.

47:20.214 --> 47:22.172
- It isn't the gin, sir.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.882
It's Fallon and Broom.

47:23.883 --> 47:27.055
They've delivered nearly a dozen bodies,
and each time it's the same story,

47:27.056 --> 47:28.555
young or old, they're never diseased.

47:28.556 --> 47:30.932
There are never any signs
of violence on the bodies.

47:32.475 --> 47:33.943
- What are you driving at?

47:35.311 --> 47:38.611
- I think we're being supplied
with the victims of murder.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.697
- That's a very dangerous thing
to say, Mr. Murray.

47:46.405 --> 47:49.157
We are anatomists, not policemen.

47:49.158 --> 47:52.128
We're scientists, not moralists.

47:52.828 --> 47:55.707
I need bodies. They brought bodies.

47:56.290 --> 47:59.337
I pay for what I need.
I do not hire murderers.

47:59.338 --> 48:02.214
Here, I'll give you some of this, eh?

48:02.838 --> 48:05.466
I'll take this and this.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.656
- Hey, hey. Hey!

48:22.400 --> 48:25.199
Where do you two think you're going?
You haven't paid for your drinks.

48:25.200 --> 48:28.366
- Oh, you'll be paid before we meet again.
- And when's that to be?

48:28.367 --> 48:31.787
- When we get more, you'll get more.
- I'll believe it when I see it.

48:31.788 --> 48:33.377
- Here, give that to your wife.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.456
Can you believe that man?
The money we put into his hand,

48:36.457 --> 48:39.004
he tries to stop our credit.
What?

48:40.167 --> 48:41.464
What've you got there?

48:41.465 --> 48:44.213
Oh, God, Broom.
That's why I love ya.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.767
- For the last time, I don't know no Flynn.

48:55.768 --> 48:59.561
- It's Timothy Boylan Flynn
from County Donegal.

48:59.562 --> 49:02.734
It's my brother. He... he come over here
two years ago.

49:02.735 --> 49:05.027
He followed the tinker's trade.
- I don't know a Flynn.

49:05.028 --> 49:07.152
I've never known a Flynn,
and I don't wanted to.

49:07.153 --> 49:10.995
- But he's a tall, dark boy,
and the lobes of his ears is pointed.

49:10.996 --> 49:12.913
- I never clocked eyes
on such a fella.

49:12.914 --> 49:16.536
- Here, a parting gift from himself.

49:16.537 --> 49:18.371
Timothy Boylan Flynn.

49:18.372 --> 49:19.792
- Did you say the name Flynn?

49:19.793 --> 49:22.043
- It is, yes.
- That's me mother's name.

49:22.044 --> 49:24.836
- Oh, what from... from Ardara, Donegal?

49:24.837 --> 49:26.758
- Ah, that's me mother's home town.

49:26.759 --> 49:29.474
- Oh, no.
- Would your name be Flynn as well?

49:29.475 --> 49:32.051
- Oh, it would. It would, indeed, yes.

49:32.052 --> 49:35.638
I'm looking for me brother.
He's a tinker by trade.

49:35.639 --> 49:37.979
He's all I have in the world.
- You've nobody?

49:37.980 --> 49:41.523
- No, me only kith and kin.
- Well, not any more, eh, not any more.

49:41.524 --> 49:43.396
You must be me cousin. - No.

49:43.397 --> 49:46.901
- Me little cousin Flynn
from Donegal.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.120
Broom, did you hear that?

49:50.121 --> 49:52.577
Eh, Flynn from Donegal,
all alone in the world.

49:52.578 --> 49:55.620
- Is that a fact?
- It's my brother I'm looking for.

49:55.621 --> 49:57.370
- Well, we'll help you find him, eh, eh?

49:57.371 --> 50:01.336
We'll pull the whole town to do it.
But, wait, we'll have a drink, eh?

50:01.337 --> 50:04.711
Come on, now. Have a drink of that, eh?
Eh, me newfound cousin...

50:04.712 --> 50:07.589
- Fallon and Broom to commit murder
and to sell him the bodies.

50:07.590 --> 50:10.842
Less than 24 hours before
he was delivered to the Academy,

50:10.843 --> 50:13.259
I saw that same old man alive.

50:13.260 --> 50:16.605
It isn't possible
he could've died a natural death.

50:16.606 --> 50:20.308
- Can't people die a natural death
in 24 hours?

50:20.309 --> 50:22.310
- He did not die a natural death.

50:22.311 --> 50:25.939
- Was this old man strangled or stabbed

50:25.940 --> 50:28.361
or shot or poisoned
or beaten to death?

50:28.362 --> 50:31.158
- There were no signs of violence
on the body.

50:32.738 --> 50:35.156
- And so you have no proof at all.

50:35.157 --> 50:37.492
How could you?

50:37.493 --> 50:39.746
Why did you come to me with such a story?

50:39.747 --> 50:41.246
You should go to the police.

50:41.247 --> 50:43.625
- I thought of that.
I thought of everything.

50:43.626 --> 50:47.754
- And if you call my husband a murderer,
everyone will call you a murderer.

50:47.755 --> 50:50.006
They will call you murderer and butcher.

50:50.756 --> 50:53.803
- All I know is that if he didn't
pay them to commit murder,

50:53.804 --> 50:56.771
then he bought the bodies knowing
that they had been murdered.

50:58.138 --> 51:01.859
- I thought it was one of your duties
to buy the bodies.

51:04.103 --> 51:06.356
Will that help you very much
when you accuse him?

51:07.106 --> 51:08.820
Will you go to the police now?

51:08.821 --> 51:11.281
Will you tell everybody
what you've told me?

51:11.282 --> 51:15.327
It will be quite easy for you
to wreck your life and his and mine.

51:15.328 --> 51:17.199
I shan't try to stop you.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.414
- Good afternoon, Mr. Murray.

51:21.415 --> 51:26.130
I didn't know anyone had called. I see my
sister-in-law's been entertaining you.

51:26.131 --> 51:28.797
- Mr. Murray called to see
if Thomas was here.

51:28.798 --> 51:30.715
He had something to discuss with him,

51:30.716 --> 51:34.434
but now he says it doesn't matter,
does it, Mr. Murray?

51:43.475 --> 51:46.102
- Oh, hello.
I suppose you come for our Jen.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.447
Hang on, I'll call her. Jen?

51:49.398 --> 51:52.400
Jennie? Your young man's here.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.489
Leave you to it.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.458
- Blimey, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

52:00.409 --> 52:02.609
What are you doing here?
You said you'd never come here.

52:03.245 --> 52:05.917
- I need you, Jennie.
- No, you shouldn't have come here.

52:05.918 --> 52:07.587
You don't belong here, I do.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.679
Look, the other day was special,
but that was the other day.

52:14.214 --> 52:15.682
I'm a whore.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.849
But I don't wanna be your whore.

52:21.555 --> 52:23.102
Please don't come back again.

52:38.322 --> 52:40.575
- I never thought I'd see you
turn business away.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.533
- Old age does.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.545
- Ah, sod it. Come on, let's go and see
if someone'll buy us a drink.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.853
- Oh, my God!

53:02.304 --> 53:04.306
- Oh, my sweet little cousin, eh.

53:04.890 --> 53:07.564
It's lucky we met you today.
You'll never be lonely again.

53:08.644 --> 53:11.396
- But I... I will see my brother, won't I?

53:11.397 --> 53:13.240
Ah, you will, you will.

53:13.816 --> 53:17.070
And your mother and your father,
and plenty more besides.

53:18.278 --> 53:19.987
Come on now, in you go.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.286
- Come on, come on. Here we are.
- Ah, come on.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.620
Tell me, where are we going?

53:25.621 --> 53:29.715
Come on, come on!
We'll have a party to wake the dead.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.805
- Who are youse?
- These are the Webbs, Fallon.

53:40.806 --> 53:44.271
Mr. and Mrs. Webb, and they've
a child asleep next door.

53:45.055 --> 53:48.605
- What are they doing here?
- Lodgers, Broom. New lodgers.

53:50.644 --> 53:53.688
- God bless youse,
Mr. Webb and Mrs. Webb.

53:53.689 --> 53:56.283
I'm Fallon. This is Mr. Broom...

53:57.359 --> 53:58.861
and this is Mrs. Flynn.

53:59.611 --> 54:03.161
Yeah, Mrs. Flynn, my newfound cousin
from Donegal, eh?

54:03.949 --> 54:06.168
We'll have a party, eh, all of us?

54:06.169 --> 54:08.458
Fit for the kings of Ireland, huh?

54:12.708 --> 54:15.168
- You stupid bitch!

54:15.169 --> 54:18.629
Lodgers, lodgers?

54:18.630 --> 54:22.133
What'd ya take in lodgers for
without asking me and Fallon first?

54:22.134 --> 54:23.805
- We need the money, Broom.

54:23.806 --> 54:25.641
- How much did you get?
- Two bob.

54:25.642 --> 54:27.605
- Give us it.
- I haven't got it.

54:28.807 --> 54:31.851
It's spent. It's spent, Broom.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.936
- Spent? On what?

54:33.937 --> 54:35.109
- Food.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.900
- Two shillings on food?
You lying bitch.

54:38.901 --> 54:40.949
- Wait... here.

54:52.873 --> 54:55.092
Never, never lie to Broom.

55:02.382 --> 55:05.384
Kate, when I give you the nod,

55:05.385 --> 55:08.679
get rid of, what's their name, Webbs.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.899
- How do you mean “get rid of them”?

55:10.900 --> 55:13.726
- Ah! Take 'em to your sisters,

55:13.727 --> 55:15.525
anywhere, just get rid of 'em!

55:16.647 --> 55:19.116
Me and Fallon's got work to do.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.326
Hmm?

55:35.082 --> 55:38.042
- Mommy!

55:38.043 --> 55:40.878
Mommy! - Ah, please yourself.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.507
- Whee!

55:50.389 --> 55:53.268
Oh, God help me.

55:54.226 --> 55:57.895
Me feet are worn out.
And for having me boots off.

55:57.896 --> 56:00.820
- Here, have a drop of gin, darling.
That'll do your head good.

56:00.821 --> 56:01.942
- Oh, dear.

56:05.237 --> 56:10.994
- With all its shortcomings, I believe this
city of ours gives us much cause for pride.

56:10.995 --> 56:14.328
Good men walk in dignity and peace,

56:14.329 --> 56:17.623
and children play in green places.

56:17.624 --> 56:20.543
- I agree with Dr. Stevens.

56:20.544 --> 56:23.504
This city has a heart of goodness.

56:23.505 --> 56:25.464
- And the bowels of squalor.

56:25.465 --> 56:28.134
- One cannot deny the poor exist.

56:28.135 --> 56:30.181
We must do for them what we can.

56:30.182 --> 56:31.974
- This is a very cultured city.

56:31.975 --> 56:34.976
We have theaters and libraries
and art galleries.

56:34.977 --> 56:36.896
You can't deny that, Dr. Rock.

56:36.897 --> 56:39.488
And as my husband says,
that is a cause for pride.

56:39.489 --> 56:43.399
- Observe with pride
the homeless and the hopeless

56:43.400 --> 56:47.871
and the insane and the wretchedly drunken,
lying in their rags on the stinking cobbles.

56:48.822 --> 56:51.744
Look at the beggars and the cripples
and the tainted children

56:51.745 --> 56:53.663
and the pitiful, doomed girls.

56:53.664 --> 56:56.626
Then, Dr. Stevens, perhaps you'd care
to write a scholastic pamphlet

56:56.627 --> 56:59.751
on the depraved things that prowl
in the alleys, afraid to see the light.

56:59.752 --> 57:01.752
They were men and women once.

57:03.295 --> 57:05.296
Be proud of that, if you can.

57:05.297 --> 57:08.595
Surely, Dr. Thornton, you're
of the side of culture.

57:08.596 --> 57:12.140
- During some of my visits to the
poorer parts of the city with Dr. Rock...

57:12.141 --> 57:14.105
- Please excuse me. I shan't be long.

57:25.651 --> 57:27.619
- How dare you?
- We have no choice.

57:28.403 --> 57:31.532
- Never, do you hear me? Never bring
these cadavers to my house again.

57:31.533 --> 57:33.329
- But just have a look at him, sir.

57:33.330 --> 57:37.705
He's healthy, under 60,
and flesh still on the bone.

57:42.292 --> 57:45.590
- Barely comfortable in his grave, sir,
before we disturbed his sleep.

57:45.591 --> 57:47.463
- It's crawling with maggots.

57:47.464 --> 57:51.217
I need fresh subjects,
specimens that I can teach with.

57:51.218 --> 57:52.970
- So we've heard... fresher than fresh,

57:53.929 --> 57:55.772
but who knows
where they come from?

58:01.812 --> 58:04.652
- See my porter in the morning.
Tell him I said to pay you.

58:04.653 --> 58:07.697
- God be praised. The Lord be with you
in all your works.

58:26.169 --> 58:28.843
- Stop eating that bread and gin.
It's bad for the stomach.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.721
- God, you're an old
spoil sport, Mrs. Webb.

58:31.722 --> 58:33.936
You'd stop the dead dancing
on Judgment Day?

58:33.937 --> 58:36.303
- Ah, play on, Fallon! Ha ha ha!

58:36.304 --> 58:38.272
- Mommy!

58:39.016 --> 58:41.892
Mommy! Mommy!

58:41.893 --> 58:44.483
- All right, Nora, I'm coming.
- Mommy!

58:44.484 --> 58:46.823
- There's a child
that appreciates fine music, eh?

58:48.150 --> 58:50.026
Oh!

58:50.027 --> 58:53.247
- For Lord's sake,
is this a lodging house or a wake?

58:54.031 --> 58:57.126
- Mommy!

59:08.086 --> 59:12.089
- Oh, the poor creature,
screams like it swallowed a pin,

59:12.090 --> 59:14.180
and Fallon'll be playing
his whistle all night.

59:14.181 --> 59:17.555
There'll be no breath of peace.
Let's take child away, eh?

59:18.305 --> 59:19.898
My sister'll give you a bed.

59:23.894 --> 59:28.147
- Mama, the nasty one, he's a bad man.

59:28.148 --> 59:29.857
He hit the lady.

59:29.858 --> 59:31.734
- Oh, yes, yes, I know.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.988
Oh, there are some terrible people here.

59:33.989 --> 59:36.405
Nora seen that fella hit that woman.

59:36.406 --> 59:39.831
We're going to her sister's for the night,
and then we've got to find somewhere else.

59:39.832 --> 59:43.412
- But we paid for the whole week.
- I know,

59:43.413 --> 59:46.085
but there's something
about this place that's not right.

59:46.086 --> 59:50.088
I'm afraid. They keep pouring drink
down that poor ol' Mrs. Flynn.

59:50.089 --> 59:51.805
- They're decent folk.

59:52.714 --> 59:56.594
- No, no, I feel it in my bones.
There's something wrong with this place.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.695
- Come on.

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.485
- Your sister's place, is it far from here?
- No, not far.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.661
Yahoo!

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.294
What's he doing?

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.258
- Oh, God love me.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:22.388
When I was a girl,
I could've gone on dancing forever.

01:01:22.389 --> 01:01:26.688
- Not tonight, eh, darling? Not tonight.
- I've no breath after a bottle.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:31.145
- Fancy singing a tune like that.
- Oh.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:34.696
All I want to do is just
lay my head down and go to sleep.

01:01:34.697 --> 01:01:37.318
- So you shall, my dear, so you shall.

01:01:38.492 --> 01:01:40.362
- Give it to her, Fallon! Give it to her!

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.157
Do it, Fallon, do it! Quick, quick!

01:01:44.748 --> 01:01:47.121
Give it to her, give it to her.

01:01:47.122 --> 01:01:49.999
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.251
- Do it quick.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.921
Is she dead, huh?

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.297
Is she dead, Fallon?

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:02.468
- She's a tough ol' cow, this one.
She's a tough ol' cow.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.976
- Ah, she's gone, Fallon.
You done her good.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.479
- Try her, try her.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.822
No!

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.742
- No! No, Fallon! No, Fallon, no!

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:31.372
For Christ's sake, no!
No! Fallon, no!

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:34.047
For Christ's sake,
don't use your bare hands!

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:39.383
- There's no life left in her,
or my name's not Robert Fallon.

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:42.053
- Oh, Jesus, we better move quick.
- Fetch the ring off her hand.

01:02:42.054 --> 01:02:46.555
- All right, all right.
- Pull the thing, man, pull it, pull it!

01:02:46.556 --> 01:02:48.977
- Calm!
- Give it here, give it here!

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.487
- Hold it steady.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.668
Shines like a diamond.
- ls it a diamond, Broom?

01:03:11.669 --> 01:03:13.789
- Sure. Sure, it's a diamond.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.916
What else would it be?

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.557
God bless ya, Fallon,
we've struck it rich.

01:03:22.558 --> 01:03:26.135
- Aye, aye, we've earned
our money tonight.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:32.141
- Fresh bodies.
Fresh bodies.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:34.941
- Shut up, shut up. Someone'll hear.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.441
- She weighs a ton.
Got her?

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.285
- There's marks, Fallon.
You left marks on her neck.

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:49.334
She's useless now.
We'll get nothing for her.

01:03:49.335 --> 01:03:52.796
- What?

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.795
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.385
We got the ring... right?

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.932
Come on, let's get rid of her.
- Take an end.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.927
- Boys.
- Good morning.

01:04:55.018 --> 01:04:57.101
- How'd you come by this?

01:04:57.102 --> 01:05:00.312
- Come by it?
What do you mean come by it?

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.609
That ring's been in my family
for centuries.

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:05.156
It was me mother's
and her mother's before it.

01:05:05.157 --> 01:05:07.528
- How much you want for it?

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.657
- Seven guineas.
- Seven guineas?

01:05:09.658 --> 01:05:11.740
More like seven pence.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.835
I'll give you two bob, take it or leave it.

01:05:13.836 --> 01:05:15.124
- Two shillings?

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.210
For a family diamond
with a band of gold?

01:05:18.211 --> 01:05:20.459
- Diamond and a band of gold?

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.545
Brass and glass, my dear,
brass and glass. Two bob.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:27.971
- It's a diamond, I tell ya.
- Wanna bet?

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.390
If it's a diamond, it won't break.
Wanna give it a try?

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:36.306
- Ah, give us our money.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:40.274
- Aren't you a thieving old cow.
- Now who's calling the kettle black?

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:42.485
And don't think I believe
all that malarkey

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:45.070
about you and your mother
and her mother before her.

01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:47.568
You wouldn't know a diamond
from a sheep's eye.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:51.244
- Here, make that four, Fallon, and you can
have the pleasure of our company.

01:05:51.245 --> 01:05:54.867
Oh, make that four!

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.040
- Get them in, Fallon.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:57.791
- Come on, give us another.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:02.714
- Ah, girls, you'll have a grand night
with Fallon and Broom now, eh?

01:06:02.715 --> 01:06:05.178
- Slow night tonight, girls, eh?

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:07.004
- Date.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:12.301
- Anyone here?

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.970
I've come for my little girl's things.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.153
Let's be goin' back there then.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.498
- No, no. Let's stay here.
It's more fun. It's pissing out.

01:06:33.499 --> 01:06:36.080
- Ah, we'll go to our little room,
where you'll be as warm

01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:38.665
and as snug and
as happy as a kitten, huh?

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:41.627
- Come on, Jen, a little spit of rain
between friends, eh?

01:06:41.628 --> 01:06:45.796
- Let's do it. We got gin there.
We got gin like the morning dew.

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:48.045
Make you forget about the rain.
Come on, Jennie.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:52.090
- All right, all right.
I'll believe it when I see it.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.059
I hope you're telling the truth, woman.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:58.228
It's an offense to lie to the constabulary,
punishable by...

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:04.066
Well, bless my soul.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.940
Come on, Jennie.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.568
We'll soon have you warmer.

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:23.872
- Come on. Hey, come on.
Come on, Jennie.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:27.292
- I forgot there's, uh, new lodgers
up there. Children screaming.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.421
- Let's go to the cock pit, eh?
- No, it's cold there.

01:07:29.422 --> 01:07:31.343
- It's all right, me love. Come on.

01:07:31.344 --> 01:07:33.057
Come on, quick.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.941
- They're filthy, disgusting.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:20.845
Thomas! Thomas!

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:23.432
- Thomas!

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.277
It's all right, Annabella.

01:08:26.278 --> 01:08:27.987
It's only a dream.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.337
- This'll help you sleep.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:52.419
- I can't sleep. I don't sleep.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.673
I have these awful dreams.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.345
They're vile.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.223
I'm frightened, Thomas.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:07.272
They're bringing you bodies,
aren't they, from the graveyard?

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:11.647
Consecrated ground.
- It's just street gossip.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.992
- Wherever I go, people stare at me.

01:09:13.993 --> 01:09:17.828
They whisper things about you.
Are they true?

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:23.081
- It's rumors, Annabella.
You mustn't pay any attention to them.

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:25.702
- We'll be disgraced. You'll be ruined.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:28.001
Our name will be dragged in the mud.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.260
- Come on, drink it all up.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.551
- Do you know what it is to be lonely?

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.386
I feel lonely.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:46.598
I wanted to be mistress
in my brother's house.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.523
I wanted to give dinner parties
and dances.

01:09:49.524 --> 01:09:52.568
I wanted to be
admired and charming.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:56.149
I wanted to marry,

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.950
but nobody would come
because of your stupid philosophy.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:03.950
Nobody'll come now.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.250
- Fallon...

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:13.968
Fallon?

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.011
Listen, Fallon,
I've been thinking.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.556
There's nothing for us
but to get the hell outta here.

01:10:22.557 --> 01:10:26.225
We've gotta make a run for it.
Now, when there's time.

01:10:26.226 --> 01:10:27.973
- What do you mean “run for it”?

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.814
There's work to be done,
money to be made.

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:33.400
For them two girls,
twice seven sovereigns.

01:10:33.401 --> 01:10:37.276
- Forget them girls, Fallon.
There's no more money in it for us.

01:10:37.277 --> 01:10:38.447
There's only trouble.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.704
- They're just lying there, waiting for it.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.908
- Forget them, Fallon,
for Christ's sake.

01:10:44.909 --> 01:10:47.492
And use your gin brain.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:50.040
There were coppers back there
at the lodging house.

01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:52.038
We were seen with them two whores.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:55.630
- Who seen us, who?
- People in the tavern, the landlord.

01:10:55.631 --> 01:10:56.921
God knows.

01:10:56.922 --> 01:10:59.591
- The hell with that.
- They saw us going out with them.

01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:02.092
- All right, we'll do just one then, eh?

01:11:02.093 --> 01:11:06.511
Can I, just one?
Just think of them young and fresh, huh?

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:09.810
- You're not listening to me, Fallon.
The game's up.

01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:12.811
- Not for me, it isn't.
Oh, God, no, not for me.

01:11:12.812 --> 01:11:15.780
No. Find me a pillow, Broom, eh.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.695
Find me something soft
to put on her face.

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:24.205
Come on, I'll do it. I always do it.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.457
Come on, just stay with me, Broom.
- Get your hands off me.

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:31.203
- What's the matter with ya?
- You'd do me if you had the chance, Fallon.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.751
- Broom, no, not you, just...
Just one of the girls, eh?

01:11:33.752 --> 01:11:37.377
Just one of them. Come on.
Look, I'll do it right this time.

01:11:37.378 --> 01:11:39.628
I'll leave no marks
on their neck, eh, eh?

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.844
Trust me, Broom, trust me.
Give me the money, eh?

01:11:41.845 --> 01:11:44.054
- You're not in it for the money, Fallon.

01:11:44.055 --> 01:11:47.344
There's a madness in you. You can't wait
to get your hands on them.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.313
- No, no, no, Broom.
It's the money, it's the money.

01:11:49.314 --> 01:11:51.478
- No, not for you, Fallon, not anymore.

01:11:51.479 --> 01:11:56.696
What you love is the feeling when
you're stopping a life. You mad bastard!

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.152
- Broom, come back here. Broom.

01:12:00.024 --> 01:12:02.692
Broom, come back here!
Broom! Come...

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:44.615
- Fresh bodies, fresh bodies,
fresh bodies, fresh bodies, fresh bodies.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.865
- Gentlemen,
what is there to dissect...

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.915
the human conscience.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.427
- Quick, let's have the money.

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.347
- How did you come by this one?

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:16.600
- Just give me the money. I'll be gone.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:20.196
- She's still warm.
How'd you come by it?

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.400
- Oh, it's a strange story, but, uh...

01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:26.243
I'll tell ya, but it's just
between the two of us, eh?

01:13:26.244 --> 01:13:31.781
This, uh, this whore and me, we was
together, you know what I mean, eh?

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:37.078
When then she made this sudden noise
in her throat and passed away onto me.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.545
I couldn't believe it.
I mean, there she was one moment,

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:43.919
you know, young and healthy,
the next...

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.379
in me arms, under me.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.715
- You mean while you were in the...

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:51.843
In the middle of it.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:55.221
Strange piece of luck. No mistake.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:58.558
- No mistake.
- You're a rotten, lying murderer.

01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:02.150
And if I wasn't told to pay you
and keep me mouth shut,

01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:05.195
I'd have the law on you immediately.
Now get out!

01:14:05.196 --> 01:14:07.776
- Don't you tell me what to do.

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:11.696
You're scum like me,
and I don't take orders from scum.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.991
Now, I'll be back with this one's friend,

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.462
so you just have your money ready
and your mouth shut.

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:27.005
- There is right and wrong, gentlemen...

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:30.683
just as there is right and left.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.771
Mine is the right direction.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:40.064
The fact that the majority would
consider it to be the wrong direction

01:14:40.065 --> 01:14:44.396
only substantiates my opinion
that I am right.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.695
Stay out.

01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:51.573
I see, sir, that in order to keep you out,
I should have said to come in.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:55.200
- They brought another body, sir.
- I didn't expect they'd bring a soul.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:15:00.293
- This one's fresh, sir, too fresh.

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:03.791
- They're corpse diviners, Tom.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:09.172
Some have green fingers for gardening,
so they have black fingers for death.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:14.602
Do you expect the dead
to walk here, Tom?

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.439
They need assistance.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.152
Fallon and Broom
provide that assistance.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.718
- Jennie.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.423
My God! Tom!

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.550
Tom! Tom!

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:39.761
- Sir?
- Who brought her in?

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.721
- Fallon.
- Where is he now?

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:45.693
- He said he'd come back with another one.
- Oh, God. Jennie!

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.678
- Open up, for God's sake!

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.053
- Where's Jennie? Jennie!

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.806
- Ask Alice.
They're always together.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:27.183
- Where's Jennie? Where is she?

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.060
- Get out of here!
What do you think you're doing?

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.401
- Where's Jennie?
- I don't know where she is.

01:17:31.402 --> 01:17:34.776
- She was in the Black Boar,
drinking with Fallon and Broom last night.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.619
- Alice?

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:47.913
Alice?

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.505
Alice.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:56.588
- Where you going?

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.966
- Where's Alice?
- She went for a walk.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.810
- Ah, she wouldn't go without me.
Where is she?

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:03.892
- Ah, you can never
trust your friends, Jennie.

01:18:03.893 --> 01:18:07.767
You've made closest brothers,
you look around, they've gone, huh?

01:18:07.768 --> 01:18:10.393
You never know when
they're gonna turn on ya, eh?

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:11.811
No, no.

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:14.609
- I've gotta go, Fallon.
I've got me living to earn!

01:18:14.610 --> 01:18:17.736
- Don't you like my company now?
Hey, look, look, look.

01:18:17.737 --> 01:18:20.445
Look. I'll give you money enough

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:22.492
to keep you off the streets
for a month, eh?

01:18:22.493 --> 01:18:24.991
How'd you come by that?

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:27.744
That's a fortune. Where's Alice?

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:30.214
- Let me go.
I won't say nothing, I swear it!

01:18:30.215 --> 01:18:34.083
Come on now, come on, come on.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.178
Come on, Jennie, eh? Come on.

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:39.631
It won't take a minute.
Just think of it, eh?

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:42.383
No more hunger, no more cold.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.762
It's a blessing I'm giving ya.

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:48.728
- How about a drink, Fallon?
You can't deny me a drink.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.367
Have one, too, Fallon.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.643
- We can't go back to the rooms.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.185
I'll get a horse and cart,
and we'll meet when it's dark.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.694
- Where's Jennie Bailey?

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.773
Hey you, where's Jennie Bailey?

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.067
- Where's Jennie?
- I don't know!

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:44.368
- She was in here last night with Fallon.
- They found the body in the sewer.

01:19:44.369 --> 01:19:47.663
- God damn that mad bastard Fallon.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.912
- Broom! Come here!

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.959
Now what have you done
with her, Broom?

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.459
Where is she? - Let go of me.

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:00.920
- You tell me, or I'll kill you!
I'll tear you apart, Broom!

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.510
- Get out of here!
- Where is she?

01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:03.926
- Stop! Stop!
- I'll crush you!

01:20:03.927 --> 01:20:06.677
Come back here, you scumbag!
Come here, Broom!

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:20.606
- My eggs!

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:23.234
You swine!

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:26.195
- Tell me where she is, or I'll choke you.

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:29.325
- She's... she's in the cockpit.

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.953
- That's enough now, Jennie.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.503
We don't want St. Peter
to smell it on your breath, eh?

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.718
He might not let you in.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:45.766
- Come, Fallon.
Come lie beside me.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.769
Oh, go on, Fallon, you want me.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:51.679
You'll be warm with me, Fallon.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.355
You and me, as long as you like.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:21:00.148
No extra for taking off me clothes,
eh, Fallon? What do you say?

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:09.911
Now you make your peace with God.

01:21:09.912 --> 01:21:12.285
- That is, if God listens to whores.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.127
- Help!
- Come here, you cow.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.361
- Now keep still, Fallon,
or I'll break your arm!

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:04.512
- They've arrested
Fallon and Broom, sir.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:06.923
Murder.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:11.769
- I think we're being supplied
with the victims of murder.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.342
- Where's Bob Fallon?
- In hospital.

01:22:43.343 --> 01:22:46.252
- Hospital? What's the matter with him?

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.130
Blood poisoning, is it?

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.924
I wanna see the governor.
Tell him I got things to say to him.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:54.394
- The governor's not interested
in talking to the likes of you!

01:22:54.395 --> 01:22:58.478
- Wait, wait, wait. He might be
interested in a little bargain.

01:22:58.479 --> 01:23:01.023
I'll tell him everything he wants to know
about Bob Fallon.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:04.571
What is it they call it,
turning King's evidence, huh?

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.523
- Thomas!

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.610
Thank heaven I found you.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:14.077
Broom has tuned King's evidence.
- The King will be pleased.

01:23:14.078 --> 01:23:18.201
- Thomas, it's serious.
He accuses you of paying Fallon to murder.

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:20.580
- Now, why should he say a thing like that?

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.708
Can you believe it?

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:29.464
Out of the mud of the darkness
come two ignorant animals,

01:23:29.465 --> 01:23:36.385
and quite slowly they set about the task
of bringing my life and my work down,

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:40.431
down into the slime that bred them.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:44.060
- Hang Rock! Hang Rock!
Hang Rock!

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.938
Hang Rock! Hang him! Hang Rock!

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:51.317
- The heart, gentlemen, is a four-chambered
muscular bag...

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.618
- Gentlemen!

01:23:57.157 --> 01:24:00.079
Because the scum of the city howl
for my blood outside the window,

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:05.208
must you conduct yourselves in return
as though you were nurtured on pig swill?

01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:06.874
Take your seats.

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:13.762
- Pay no attention to the mob.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:18.516
The mob can never win.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:32.576
- The Medical Faculty want you
to appear before them tomorrow.

01:24:32.577 --> 01:24:33.985
- Why?

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:37.490
- I make no secret of the fact
that several members of this faculty

01:24:37.491 --> 01:24:40.241
are in favor of having you struck off.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:43.462
Some even advocate criminal proceedings.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.711
The fact that we haven't already done so

01:24:46.712 --> 01:24:49.881
is purely to protect the doctors
and surgeons of this city

01:24:49.882 --> 01:24:53.096
whom you have brought into disrepute.

01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:58.348
- I cannot keep your hands clean,
gentlemen, when mine are dirty.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:03.556
The practice of anatomy

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:07.310
is absolutely vital
to the progress of medicine,

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:10.565
and medicine is vital to
the progress of mankind,

01:25:10.566 --> 01:25:14.364
and mankind is worth fighting for.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:21.490
I take full responsibility for my actions.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:22.959
Good day, gentlemen.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:25.917
- Gentlemen.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:33.711
- Guilty or not guilty, his part in this
affair must be kept in decent obscurity.

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:36.047
- Of course, of course.

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:39.302
Dr. Rock will not be the subject
of criminal proceedings,

01:25:39.303 --> 01:25:43.393
and he will not be called upon to give
evidence in the trial of Fallon and Broom.

01:25:43.394 --> 01:25:47.859
I've spoken to the public prosecutor,
and he gives me his assurance on that.

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:54.196
Anyway, no court could punish him,
much as his own conscience will.

01:25:56.568 --> 01:26:00.321
- The only thing I regret
is what I've done to the...

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:02.541
the people I love the most.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:07.504
- Whatever happens,
Thomas, I'll be with you.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:22.603
- "The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.270
In pastures of tender grass,
He causeth me to lie down..."

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:33.276
- Will that Dr. Rock cut me open?
Look at me insides?

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:39.036
- Not likely, Bob, not likely.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.824
You'll be given
to the Medical Faculty by law.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:48.045
You'll end up a university man.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:52.373
- Thy rod and thy staff,
they indeed comfort...

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.968
- Will you stop that praying,
for Christ's sake?!

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.506
- All that noise, huh?

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:05.600
- Come on, Bob, swig your gin.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.766
It's nearly time.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.657
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty...

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:30.706
- I believe in God, the Father Almighty.
I don't believe in God.

01:27:30.707 --> 01:27:33.799
I believe in the darkness,
in the black, black grey.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.418
I believe in that
rotten lying bastard Broom.

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.712
Oh, God, no!

01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:43.299
No, no! I don't wanna hang.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.801
It's not me, it wasn't me.

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.975
It was these hands.
These hands, they're the murderers.

01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:50.392
It wasn't me, not me.
- Come on, now, now, Robert.

01:27:50.393 --> 01:27:54.236
Come on now. I want you to face your Lord
on this day and pray to him.

01:27:54.237 --> 01:27:56.605
- Oh, Lord...
Oh, Lord!

01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:01.442
Oh, God, I don't want them to cut me up!

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:05.038
Help me, God!
God, save me, save me, save me.

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.992
I don't wanna die.
Please, Jesus, save me.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:19.132
Oh, Lord, no, please,
I don't wanna die! No!

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.967
No! Oh, my God, I can't see!

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:31.098
Help! I'm... I'm gonna suffocate.
I'll suffocate!

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.064
I believe in God the Father, Almighty.

01:28:35.065 --> 01:28:37.269
Creator of Heaven.

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:41.525
Please take it off, take it off.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

01:28:56.373 --> 01:29:00.298
- Doesn't it bother you that you sold
your friend to the hangman?

01:29:00.299 --> 01:29:02.461
- Nothing bothers me.

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:05.631
Nothing in this world bothers me,

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:09.051
except me, Timothy Broom.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.898
- Stop the Rock!
Stop the Rock! Stop the Rock!

01:29:12.899 --> 01:29:18.060
Stop the Rock!
- Up the alley and down the street,

01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:21.480
Fallon and Broom shall burn their meat.

01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:24.567
Fallon's a butcher and Broom's a thief,

01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:27.993
and Rock's the boy
that buys the beef!

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:34.910
- My name is a ghost to
frightened children.

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.122
Did I set myself up as a god over death?

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:41.093
Did I set myself up over pity?

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:46.547
Oh, my God. I knew what I was doing.
