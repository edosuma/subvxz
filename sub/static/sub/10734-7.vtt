Gwen: Rook, what's going on?

15:40.405 --> 15:42.672
<i>Rook: We have located Dr. Psychobos.</i>

15:42.707 --> 15:44.740
Ben: Is that good news or bad?

15:44.776 --> 15:47.210
Rook: Ben!
I suspected that was you.

15:47.245 --> 15:49.912
Kevin: What?
Everybody knew except me?

15:49.948 --> 15:53.015
Rook: The doctor's latest psionic
augmentations are impressive.

15:53.051 --> 15:55.184
For a Cerebral Crustacean.

15:55.219 --> 15:58.855
And I think he sent a signal to
a mutant To'kustar.

15:58.890 --> 16:01.991
But other than a way bad
headed this way, we're fine.

16:02.026 --> 16:03.576
<i>Max: We're coming.</i>

16:03.577 --> 16:06.829
And as for the "way bad"...
- Ben: My job.

16:06.864 --> 16:08.831
[ Omnitrix beeping ]

16:15.806 --> 16:17.774
[ roars ]

16:28.853 --> 16:30.120
[ Omnitrix powers down ]

16:30.155 --> 16:31.488
<i>Ben: Aah!</i>

16:31.524 --> 16:32.723
[ coughs ]

16:32.758 --> 16:34.225
A little out of practice.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.129
<i>Ben Tennyson! The frogs
told us they'd finished you off.</i>

16:38.164 --> 16:39.030
Ben: Not yet.

16:39.065 --> 16:43.267
<i>Well, we're ready to fight
back ... humans and aliens.</i>

16:48.973 --> 16:51.674
Run!

16:51.710 --> 16:54.110
[ beeps ]

16:54.145 --> 16:58.314
<i>Waybig: You are in big
trouble ... way big!</i>

16:58.349 --> 17:00.950
Emperor Millious: Tennyson!
Tennyson!?

17:00.985 --> 17:01.917
[ croaks ]

17:01.953 --> 17:04.887
Get this thing in the air!
I'm through playin'!

17:04.922 --> 17:07.589
I will personally
blast that fool to bits!

17:07.624 --> 17:12.226
But, Emperor, the repairs are not
complete. The maneuvering jets are ...

17:12.262 --> 17:13.361
<i>Aah!</i>

17:13.396 --> 17:17.198
Emperor Millious: Have you
any other objections?

17:38.751 --> 17:40.285
<i>Waybig: Oh, yeah!</i>

17:40.320 --> 17:43.187
<i>[ roars ]</i>

17:43.223 --> 17:44.655
Waybig: Oh, yeah.

17:44.691 --> 17:49.527
<i>Pathetic simpletons!
You are wasting your time.</i>

17:49.563 --> 17:53.297
<i>I control every mutant
To'kustar on Earth.</i>

17:53.333 --> 17:57.152
<i>I can squash your resistance ...</i>

17:57.153 --> 18:00.971
<i>and I use the term
loosely ... like b-b-bugs.</i>

18:01.006 --> 18:03.908
Simpletons?!
The simplest Galvan is still

18:03.943 --> 18:06.911
smarter than a Cerebral Crustacean.

18:06.946 --> 18:09.614
Yeah, and we ought to know.

18:16.489 --> 18:18.924
Ugh!

18:18.959 --> 18:22.695
Rook: Ben, Dr. Psychobos no
longer controls the mutants.

18:22.730 --> 18:28.901
Waybig: So, why are
they still fighting?

18:28.936 --> 18:32.138
<i>Psychobos: They're feral, you dolts.
Without my great mind</i>

18:32.173 --> 18:37.209
<i>controlling them, they will
destroy everything in sight.</i>

18:37.244 --> 18:39.712
<i>[ Psychobos laughing evilly ]</i>

18:39.747 --> 18:43.483
Rook: Now what?
- I have an idea.

18:43.518 --> 18:45.519
No, you don't.

18:48.022 --> 18:49.656
[ pants ]

18:49.691 --> 18:52.092
Daylight at last!

18:52.127 --> 18:54.094
[ roars ]

18:54.129 --> 18:55.695
Aah!

19:01.901 --> 19:05.267
<i>Did you see that?
You took down that giant.</i>

19:05.303 --> 19:06.566
<i>You're a hero.</i>

19:06.601 --> 19:09.302
Great.
Go get your hero some pants.

19:09.338 --> 19:11.103
[ roars ]

19:20.975 --> 19:23.142
Null void projector!

19:34.353 --> 19:36.387
Emperor Millious: Huh?

19:40.590 --> 19:45.591
<i>Rook: There are way bads all
over the globe. We will return.</i>

19:50.663 --> 19:53.564
Ben: Emperor Millious.
Seems like you and I were having

19:53.599 --> 19:55.699
this same discussion a few weeks ago.

19:55.735 --> 19:58.569
Kevin: Yeah, except now froggy's mutant

19:58.570 --> 20:01.404
To'kustar army is
headed to the null void.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.439
<i>Please.</i>

20:03.474 --> 20:07.576
[ grunting ]

20:07.611 --> 20:11.579
<i>Emperor Millious: I still
have my regular army, an armada</i>

20:11.615 --> 20:15.516
<i>of super destroyers, and a conquest ray.</i>

20:15.552 --> 20:17.618
Max: And we have you.

20:21.256 --> 20:23.764
And that puts me in charge.

20:23.765 --> 20:27.528
Which, by the way,
was my plan all along.

20:27.563 --> 20:31.031
Ben: Who the what, now?

20:31.066 --> 20:34.118
<i>I sabotaged your exile
pod, figured you'd</i>

20:34.119 --> 20:37.170
<i>break free, come back,
and clobber daddy.</i>

20:37.206 --> 20:39.540
[ beeping ]

20:39.575 --> 20:41.909
You think the Ben
Tennyson is just gonna sit

20:41.910 --> 20:44.244
back and watch his home
world get conquered?

20:44.280 --> 20:47.280
Ben: You did all this so I'd
take your dad down for you?

20:47.315 --> 20:50.383
Ever since the last time I
tried to take over, he's been

20:50.418 --> 20:55.888
keeping me at tongue's length.
You were my ticket to the throne.

20:55.924 --> 20:58.958
Ben: Wow, you are
all kinds of messed up.

20:58.993 --> 21:00.992
I know!
Here's the deal.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.727
I walk away
and take the armada with me.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.998
You keep daddy, and the empire
goes back to last year's borders.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.433
Ben: You'd be getting away clean.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.768
Tough toady!

21:11.803 --> 21:15.038
I got a truce to offer,
and you don't want a war.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.473
Max: The Earth accepts your terms.

21:17.509 --> 21:18.820
Ben: But...

21:19.821 --> 21:21.443
Pleasure.

21:21.479 --> 21:25.280
We'll pay for damages ...
a small price to pay for power.

21:25.316 --> 21:28.751
<i>Emperor Millious: I should
have kept you in a stasis pod,</i>

21:28.786 --> 21:32.655

They grow up so fast.

You want to come with,
Tennyson?

21:38.497 --> 21:42.399
You know, lose that monkey face
and turn back into Bullfrag?

21:42.434 --> 21:44.167
Ben: Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.603
Your loss.
