37:58.000 --> 38:01.083
IT BOTHERS ME...

38:01.083 --> 38:02.625
ALL RIGHT?

38:05.959 --> 38:08.250
THERE ARE THINGS
THAT I WANT
TO DO WITH YOU,

38:08.250 --> 38:09.917
LIKE TAKE YOU
TO A REAL CLUB,

38:09.917 --> 38:12.125
OR ORDER A BOTTLE
OF WINE AT DINNER.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.166
YOU KNOW,
GO TO A BAR
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.417
I DON'T WANT
TO BE SOME GUY

38:14.417 --> 38:15.625
WHO'S HOLDING YOU
BACK FROM WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO.

38:15.625 --> 38:21.500
I'M DOING EXACTLY
WHAT I WANNA DO.
I'M WITH YOU.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.583
EARLIER TONIGHT,
YOU SAID THAT
I WOULD NEVER BE

38:24.583 --> 38:28.500
THE KIND OF GUY
WHO WOULD
SHRED YOUR HEART.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.792
YOU'RE RIGHT. I WOULD
NEVER INTENTIONALLY
HURT YOU, BUT...

38:32.792 --> 38:35.667
I CAN'T BE THE NICE GUY
THAT YOU DATE

38:35.667 --> 38:36.667
AFTER
A BAD RELATIONSHIP

38:36.667 --> 38:37.959
BECAUSE THERE'S NO RISK
INVOLVED.

38:37.959 --> 38:40.417
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT I'VE MADE
SOME SORT OF IMPRESSION.

38:43.959 --> 38:45.583
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

38:45.583 --> 38:48.125
REALLY?

38:48.125 --> 38:50.208
OH, YEAH.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.542
SO, WHEN DO I GET
TO SEE LUCKY?

39:01.542 --> 39:05.250
[LAUGHS]

39:05.250 --> 39:07.291
WE'LL SEE.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.959
SO, IN HIS OWN
DRUE-LIKE WAY,

39:14.959 --> 39:18.667
HE WAS JUST
FREAKED OUT BECAUSE
SHE LIKED HIM BACK.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.500
WELL, THAT KIND OF
FREAKS ME OUT, TOO, THOUGH.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.834
WHY ON EARTH WOULD SHE
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE?

39:23.834 --> 39:25.250
SHE SEEMED LIKE A PERFECTLY
REASONABLE GIRL, YOU KNOW?

39:25.250 --> 39:27.959
IT KINDA MAKES YOU WONDER.

39:27.959 --> 39:30.750
[LAUGHS]

39:30.750 --> 39:34.792
YEAH. SLEEPING WITH
SOMEBODY YOU JUST MET
IS TOTALLY REASONABLE.

39:34.792 --> 39:36.792
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE RASH,

39:36.792 --> 39:38.458
BUT TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

39:38.458 --> 39:41.750
2 PEOPLE DO SOMETHING
THAT THEY BOTH WANT TO DO
THAT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL,

39:41.750 --> 39:43.625
I DON'T EXACTLY THINK
THAT'S CRAZY.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.792
UNLIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING?

39:50.291 --> 39:52.834
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:56.041 --> 39:59.583
THE THING THAT WE DON'T
TALK ABOUT, PACE.

40:04.250 --> 40:06.083
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

40:06.083 --> 40:07.125
YES, WE DO.

40:07.125 --> 40:09.417
I MEAN, IT USED TO BE
THIS LITTLE PROBLEM

40:09.417 --> 40:10.750
THAT WE COULD
EASILY IGNORE,

40:10.750 --> 40:13.542
BUT BY DOING THAT,
ALL WE REALLY DID
WAS MAKE IT BIGGER,

40:13.542 --> 40:15.125
AND NOW, UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S SO DAMN BIG

40:15.125 --> 40:16.583
IT'S STARTING TO OBSCURE
MY VIEW OF YOU.

40:16.583 --> 40:19.583
SO, BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IF I DON'T
SLEEP WITH YOU SOON,

40:19.583 --> 40:22.542
WE'RE GONNA BREAK UP,
AND IT'S GONNA BE
ALL MY FAULT?

40:22.542 --> 40:26.250
NO. NO. NOT AT ALL.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.750
I'M AGREEING WITH YOU.
I'M SAYING THAT
WE HAVE A PROBLEM,

40:28.750 --> 40:30.834
AND THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

40:30.834 --> 40:33.208
I'M NOT SAYING IN ANY WAY
THAT IT IS YOUR FAULT
SOMEHOW THAT WE HAVE--

40:33.208 --> 40:36.125
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

40:36.125 --> 40:38.917
I MEAN, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS, PACEY,

40:38.917 --> 40:41.166
AND--AND YOU WERE FINE
WITH WAITING.

40:41.166 --> 40:44.250
I HAVE BEEN FINE
WITH WAITING.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.792
I'D HAVE BEEN TOO SCARED
TO SLEEP WITH YOU TOO SOON.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.375
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
THAT IS GONNA JEOPARDIZE

40:49.375 --> 40:52.750
THE MOST AMAZING RELATIONSHIP
THAT I'VE EVER HAD.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.625
JO, I AM HAPPY
THAT YOU AND I TOOK THE TIME

40:55.625 --> 40:57.917
TO REALLY FALL IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER,

40:57.917 --> 41:01.542
BUT WE'RE HERE NOW, JO.
THIS IS 8 MONTHS
AND COUNTING.

41:01.542 --> 41:05.667
SO, I JUST--I--
I WANT...

41:05.667 --> 41:07.333
I NEED FOR YOU TO KNOW

41:07.333 --> 41:11.792
THAT IF OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT GONNA BE PROGRESSING
ONTO THAT NEXT LEVEL...

41:11.792 --> 41:13.792
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

41:16.083 --> 41:17.291
PACEY...

41:19.166 --> 41:22.792
I WANT YOU...

41:22.792 --> 41:24.291
I REALLY DO.

41:24.291 --> 41:27.291
I NEED TO KNOW THAT.

41:29.792 --> 41:31.667
KNOW IT.

41:31.667 --> 41:37.250
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG,
BUT, UM...

41:37.250 --> 41:41.000
I JUST KEEP
HOLDING BACK.

41:44.291 --> 41:46.250
I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M SCARED.

41:46.250 --> 41:49.625
WELL, GOOD.

41:49.625 --> 41:51.417
WHAT? DO YOU THINK
I'M NOT SCARED?

41:51.417 --> 41:55.250
I'M TERRIFIED, JO.

41:55.250 --> 41:58.583
YOU ARE?

41:58.583 --> 42:01.000
YEAH.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
[LAUGHS]

42:07.917 --> 42:11.917
SO THEN, CAN WE JUST
BE SCARED TOGETHER?

42:30.875 --> 42:31.375
[KNOCKING]

42:31.375 --> 42:33.417
MR. BROOKS.

42:33.417 --> 42:37.708
[SIGHS]
MR. BROOKS.

42:37.708 --> 42:39.417
MR. BROOKS?
