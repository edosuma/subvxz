01:40.756 --> 01:42.655
Mother!

03:40.528 --> 03:41.628
Mom.

03:42.363 --> 03:43.596
Hey.

03:44.197 --> 03:46.264
There's something
outside my window.

03:47.466 --> 03:49.800
Oh, baby,
you're having a nightmare, huh?

03:51.035 --> 03:52.135
Okay.

03:52.336 --> 03:53.869
Let me put you back to bed.

03:54.637 --> 03:56.270
I want Daddy to do it.

03:57.372 --> 03:59.292
How 'bout we wait
for him together, huh?

03:59.974 --> 04:01.407
Come on in. Bring Bear.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.246
I gotcha.

04:08.413 --> 04:09.813
We'll keep each other safe.

04:31.766 --> 04:32.832
Shit.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.188
Hi.

05:32.323 --> 05:33.656
Did you figure it out?

05:33.658 --> 05:34.890
What?

05:35.124 --> 05:37.044
What you're gonna
be for Halloween.

05:37.326 --> 05:38.459
Maybe.

05:38.893 --> 05:39.893
But you're gonna have to

05:39.895 --> 05:41.694
wait until tomorrow to find out.

05:42.662 --> 05:44.029
I'll be a pirate.

05:45.498 --> 05:47.298
Ah, good choice.

05:47.499 --> 05:48.765
Mom helped me pick it out

05:48.767 --> 05:50.633
after we got the pumpkin.

05:51.635 --> 05:53.469
Mom said she'd carve it with me,

05:54.003 --> 05:55.737
but I wanted to wait for you.

05:55.739 --> 05:56.804
Oh,

05:56.971 --> 05:58.171
Well...

05:58.173 --> 05:59.405
We'll do it tomorrow,

05:59.639 --> 06:01.873
just before we go trick
or treating, okay?

06:02.140 --> 06:03.206
Promise?

06:03.507 --> 06:04.640
I promise.

06:05.308 --> 06:07.409
Now, go back to sleep.

06:12.013 --> 06:13.146
Oh, and Dad...

06:13.580 --> 06:14.680
Yes?

06:14.914 --> 06:16.547
Can you check
outside my window?

06:16.748 --> 06:17.914
I saw something.

06:20.017 --> 06:21.150
Sure.

06:29.291 --> 06:31.492
Nope, all clear.

06:32.494 --> 06:33.760
I love you, Dad.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.062
I love you too, son.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.733
I'm sorry.

06:44.468 --> 06:46.628
I'm getting tired of
going to bed without you.

06:47.303 --> 06:48.703
If they're on the fence,
I'm going to have to

06:48.705 --> 06:51.338
publish another article
as soon as I can.

06:52.340 --> 06:54.340
- Are they on the fence?
- I don't know.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.008
Just seems like I would've
received a letter by now.

07:00.978 --> 07:03.078
Charlie wanted to wait
up for you tonight.

07:05.514 --> 07:07.147
I think,

07:07.149 --> 07:09.549
if you don't carve that
pumpkin with him tomorrow,

07:10.617 --> 07:12.417
he's going to disown you.

07:13.786 --> 07:14.952
Can he do that?

07:16.354 --> 07:18.254
I think he'd
have a case, yeah.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.754
And what about you?

07:20.122 --> 07:23.190
Are you ready to disown me, too?
Huh?

07:30.195 --> 07:31.895
Can I take that as a no?

07:32.696 --> 07:35.097
I don't want you to think
I'm not mad at you, okay?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.975
<i>"My darling,
my darling, I see it aright.</i>

07:48.176 --> 07:51.577
<i>Tis the aged gray willows
deceiving thy sight."</i>

07:51.744 --> 07:53.277
<i>"I love thee!</i>

07:53.911 --> 07:57.113
<i>I'm charmed by thy
beauty, dear boy!</i>

07:57.681 --> 08:00.949
<i>And if thou'rt unwilling,
then force I'll employ."</i>

08:01.350 --> 08:03.751
<i>"My father, my father,
he seizes me fast,</i>

08:03.753 --> 08:06.553
<i>For sorely the Erl-King
has hurt me at last."</i>

08:06.854 --> 08:10.256
<i>The father now gallops,
with terror half wild,</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:13.525
<i>He grasps in his arms
the poor shuddering child,</i>

08:13.527 --> 08:16.895
<i>He reaches his courtyard
with toil and with dread,</i>

08:16.897 --> 08:22.033
<i>The child in his arms
finds he motionless, dead.</i>

08:24.302 --> 08:26.036
Pretty good, huh?

08:26.038 --> 08:27.170
Kyle.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.305
Who is this, uh, Earl Linking?

08:29.307 --> 08:30.773
And his creepy daughters.

08:31.007 --> 08:32.374
We don't know for sure.

08:32.842 --> 08:35.443
They might be creatures
out of northern mythology.

08:35.445 --> 08:36.943
Or some Celtic lore.

08:37.211 --> 08:38.778
Or they simply stepped out

08:38.780 --> 08:41.647
of Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe's nightmares.

08:43.049 --> 08:44.416
But when you go out tonight,

08:44.984 --> 08:46.584
spare a thought for Lovecraft.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.585
For Stoker, for Poe...

08:49.153 --> 08:50.720
And for Goethe's Erl-King.

08:51.021 --> 08:52.287
'Cause they were
all bound by one

08:52.289 --> 08:54.789
great, and noble objective.

08:55.624 --> 08:57.658
To scare the living
shit out of you.

08:59.795 --> 09:00.827
Happy Halloween.

09:21.580 --> 09:22.780
Hello, hello, hello!

09:23.715 --> 09:24.948
Hey, Mom.

09:25.249 --> 09:26.649
Where's my little pirate?

09:28.051 --> 09:29.251
Mom, check it out.

09:33.889 --> 09:36.924
Wow, that's a great
indoor activity.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.446
- Yeah.
- You...

09:38.859 --> 09:39.959
You look amazing.

09:41.261 --> 09:42.261
He's on fire, huh?

09:42.263 --> 09:44.263
He's so excited.

09:44.265 --> 09:46.098
The pirate looks perfect,

09:46.100 --> 09:47.499
thank you very much.

09:47.501 --> 09:48.833
And we'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

09:48.835 --> 09:49.834
Oh, yes.

09:49.836 --> 09:50.901
Happy Halloween!

09:51.269 --> 09:52.869
Happy Halloween
to you, too, Rosa.

09:53.003 --> 09:54.903
When's Dad coming home?

09:54.905 --> 09:57.305
He should
be on his way right now.

09:57.539 --> 09:59.506
- Rosa take you to art class?
- Yeah.

09:59.508 --> 10:00.740
I wanna see.

10:02.008 --> 10:04.509
Charlie, that's really scary.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.313
You wanna tell me about that?

10:11.081 --> 10:13.282
That's the thing
I saw outside my window.

10:14.017 --> 10:15.657
I thought you told
me you couldn't see it?

10:16.018 --> 10:17.151
I kinda saw it.

10:17.585 --> 10:19.151
It just kinda looked like that.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.420
Can we go, already?

10:22.422 --> 10:23.654
Where's Dad?

10:44.973 --> 10:46.540
- Yeah?
- Hannah...

10:47.441 --> 10:50.209
Oh, Michael,
come here, come here.

10:50.877 --> 10:52.177
Come, look at this.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.945
It washed ashore last
week on Jones Beach.

10:58.549 --> 11:00.149
What are those, Latin numerals?

11:00.151 --> 11:02.784
Exactly.
It's an M and a D,

11:02.786 --> 11:04.485
and possibly a C.

11:04.487 --> 11:05.719
Sixteen hundred.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.321
They used to engrave ships
with the year they were built,

11:08.323 --> 11:10.122
which means this piece
of driftwood was once

11:10.124 --> 11:11.823
part of the body of
a ship that helped

11:11.825 --> 11:14.325
settle this city 400 years ago.

11:14.327 --> 11:16.247
That's quite
something, isn't it?

11:16.927 --> 11:18.027
And so's this.

11:23.966 --> 11:26.100
"Dear Professor Lawford."

11:26.102 --> 11:27.868
Congratulations, Mike!

11:28.302 --> 11:29.935
You've come a long way from that

11:29.937 --> 11:32.837
arrogant Yank who drank
himself out of Heidelberg.

11:32.839 --> 11:34.799
Thanks for
recommending me, Hannah.

11:34.973 --> 11:37.741
You deserve it,
more than anybody.

11:41.478 --> 11:43.111
I've gotta go,

11:43.113 --> 11:45.353
I have a very important
appointment with a pirate.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.190
Hey.

12:10.137 --> 12:12.504
God, it was the most incredible
exhibit I've ever seen.

12:12.972 --> 12:14.732
And they, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:14.873 --> 12:16.974
Easy on the candy,
all of you, please.

12:16.976 --> 12:18.909
Maybe Dad
called and you missed it.

12:19.310 --> 12:20.410
I will try him again.

12:43.195 --> 12:44.828
<i>Hi, it's Mike,
leave a message,</i>

12:44.830 --> 12:46.896
<i>I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.</i>

12:49.299 --> 12:50.399
Hey.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.100
You okay?

12:52.701 --> 12:55.102
- Did you see it, Mom?
- Did I see what?

12:56.003 --> 12:57.069
The bird.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.036
The bird?

13:00.338 --> 13:01.404
No.

13:01.972 --> 13:03.072
No, I don't.

13:16.885 --> 13:18.886
<i>I think I'll
be Robin Hood next year.</i>

13:18.888 --> 13:21.321
He steals from the rich
and gives to the poor.

13:21.323 --> 13:23.990
Well, that is
very noble, my little man.

13:24.391 --> 13:26.358
And I bet he keeps
a little extra on the side

13:26.360 --> 13:28.426
just to himself.

13:28.428 --> 13:29.493
I see.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.065
Mom, can we go to
the carnival, please?

13:37.566 --> 13:39.800
No, not this year, my man.

13:40.168 --> 13:43.336
I'm sorry, it is late, and
you have school tomorrow.

13:43.338 --> 13:45.737
Come with me.
Come on, come on my prince.

13:47.239 --> 13:48.939
I said, Draw, partner!

13:50.241 --> 13:51.274
Dad!

13:51.276 --> 13:52.742
You're a cowboy!

13:52.744 --> 13:54.076
I couldn't find
my cowboy hat,

13:54.078 --> 13:55.210
but boy, you guys look great.

13:55.212 --> 13:56.744
You make a great pirate,
Charlie.

13:56.746 --> 13:57.911
Where were you?

13:58.245 --> 13:59.445
Mom said you were
gonna meet up with us.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.247
I apologize,
my phone died.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.174
Come on,
let's go to bed.

14:03.448 --> 14:04.448
Mom,

14:04.450 --> 14:05.849
can we go to the carnival,

14:05.851 --> 14:07.750
just for a bit, please?

14:08.585 --> 14:09.785
Oh, let me take him.

14:10.219 --> 14:11.786
Just give us a half an hour.

14:12.587 --> 14:14.754
- Come on, Kristen.
- Okay, okay.

14:14.756 --> 14:16.021
Okay, but
would you do me a favor

14:16.023 --> 14:17.055
and put him to bed, tonight?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.289
He is hopped up on enough sugar

14:18.291 --> 14:20.624
to last him until Christmas

14:20.626 --> 14:22.893
and I have to finish some
client designs tonight.

14:22.895 --> 14:24.575
- Of course.
- All right.

14:24.828 --> 14:25.894
I got it.

14:26.128 --> 14:27.194
You got what?

14:27.562 --> 14:28.929
Drum roll, please.

14:30.898 --> 14:32.098
I got tenure.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.868
Oh, my God!

14:35.870 --> 14:38.036
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you!

14:39.705 --> 14:41.405
Does this mean that we can go?

14:42.206 --> 14:43.873
Yes, it means you can go.

14:44.641 --> 14:46.681
It means that we will
celebrate tonight.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.342
Everything's going
to be better now.

14:48.344 --> 14:50.077
You boys have fun tonight.

14:50.678 --> 14:51.744
Come here.

14:52.011 --> 14:53.578
Candy please, young man.

14:54.746 --> 14:56.746
- Come on, already.
- Hey, let's do it.

14:57.014 --> 14:58.774
- Hey, Professor?
- Uh huh?

14:58.915 --> 14:59.915
Keep your chaps on, yeah?

14:59.917 --> 15:00.916
Yeah!

15:00.918 --> 15:02.017
Let's go, Dad.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.317
Smile, Dad.

15:42.219 --> 15:43.319
You having fun?

15:43.887 --> 15:45.153
This is awesome.

15:55.030 --> 15:56.630
You see those skeletons?

15:57.064 --> 15:58.264
Pretty scary, huh?

16:07.238 --> 16:08.304
Charlie?

16:12.442 --> 16:13.542
Okay.

16:15.144 --> 16:16.444
All right?

16:18.113 --> 16:20.233
I'm sorry we didn't
carve pumpkins together.

16:20.615 --> 16:21.715
It's okay.

16:21.949 --> 16:23.416
I know you got a
lot of work to do.

16:23.418 --> 16:24.450
No, it's not okay.

16:24.452 --> 16:26.018
I promised I'd be there,

16:26.285 --> 16:28.686
and promises dads make to
their sons are special things.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.440
You know you're
the most important

16:30.487 --> 16:31.767
person in the
world to me, right?

16:31.988 --> 16:33.154
Yeah.

16:34.322 --> 16:35.555
Let's get some ice cream!

16:39.325 --> 16:40.391
Hey.

16:41.393 --> 16:42.459
Charlie.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.260
Charlie.

16:44.262 --> 16:45.742
I really need you
to stay close to me,

16:45.928 --> 16:47.094
and I need you to look
where you're going, okay?

16:47.096 --> 16:48.462
Let me, let me take that.

16:49.997 --> 16:51.130
Come on.

16:52.599 --> 16:54.132
What kind of ice
cream do you want?

16:54.134 --> 16:56.300
Swirled cone with
rainbow sprinkles.

16:56.302 --> 16:57.367
Sounds good.

17:14.815 --> 17:15.881
Dad,

17:17.583 --> 17:19.416
can we pay the ghost?

17:20.117 --> 17:21.184
Pay the what?

17:21.185 --> 17:22.318
Next.

17:22.652 --> 17:24.853
Right, uh, yeah,
a swirled cone

17:24.855 --> 17:26.320
with rainbow sprinkles, please.

17:26.323 --> 17:27.821
Okay. Six bucks.

17:28.123 --> 17:29.223
Yeah.

17:29.991 --> 17:31.091
Keep the change.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.162
Charlie?

17:37.830 --> 17:38.896
Charlie!

17:40.498 --> 17:42.398
- Next!
- Did you see where my son went?

17:42.832 --> 17:43.998
Uh-uh.

17:44.332 --> 17:46.098
- Charlie.
- Who's next?

17:48.134 --> 17:49.200
Charlie!

17:51.536 --> 17:52.802
Where are you?

17:55.506 --> 17:56.605
Charlie!

18:04.113 --> 18:05.179
Charlie!

18:08.316 --> 18:09.382
Charlie.

18:10.851 --> 18:11.951
Hey!

18:12.986 --> 18:14.052
Let him go!

18:14.653 --> 18:15.719
What are you doing?

18:16.454 --> 18:17.554
Charlie!

18:18.689 --> 18:19.921
Charlie, where are you?

18:22.691 --> 18:23.857
Charlie!

18:28.696 --> 18:29.929
This is my son's hat!

18:30.664 --> 18:31.984
The boy that was
wearing this hat,

18:32.131 --> 18:33.397
- did you see him?
- Sir, are you okay?

18:33.399 --> 18:34.599
My son was wearing this hat!

18:34.731 --> 18:36.031
- Sir... Hey, Buddy!
- Charlie!

18:36.232 --> 18:37.732
Officer, Officer,
this is my son's hat.

18:37.734 --> 18:38.899
He's missing!

18:38.901 --> 18:40.066
When did you see him last?

18:40.400 --> 18:41.333
He was right here by
the ice cream truck,

18:41.335 --> 18:42.400
he was right next to me.

18:42.402 --> 18:43.701
Have you tried calling him?

18:43.968 --> 18:45.668
He's seven years old,
he doesn't have a phone.

18:45.670 --> 18:46.902
Sir, do you live around here?

18:46.904 --> 18:48.103
Maybe he just went home.

19:04.753 --> 19:06.653
- Charlie!
- Mike what's wrong?

19:07.054 --> 19:08.687
- Is he here?
- What's wrong, what's wrong?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.855
Where's Charlie?
Where's Charlie!

19:10.857 --> 19:12.690
I was holding his hand,
I looked everywhere!

19:12.692 --> 19:15.012
What are you telling me?
Are you saying you left him?

19:16.994 --> 19:18.227
Jesus Christ, Mike!

19:20.163 --> 19:21.563
Charlie!

19:23.566 --> 19:24.766
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

19:27.537 --> 19:29.137
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

19:30.271 --> 19:31.638
Charlie,
where are you?

19:32.339 --> 19:33.439
Charlie!

19:34.274 --> 19:35.407
Can you hear me?

19:47.719 --> 19:49.019
<i>Any problems at home?</i>

19:49.387 --> 19:51.507
Any reason why Charlie
might wanna run away?

19:51.789 --> 19:52.855
No.

19:53.690 --> 19:54.856
Okay.

19:55.023 --> 19:56.556
We've issued an Amber Alert,

19:56.558 --> 19:58.691
sent Charlie's stats
out over the wire.

19:58.693 --> 20:00.859
Every cop in Arizona'll
look out for him.

20:00.861 --> 20:03.528
Usually these cases are
solved within 24 hours.

20:03.530 --> 20:04.896
So, try and sit tight.

20:07.066 --> 20:09.106
Go home to your wife,
we'll be in touch.

20:41.764 --> 20:42.830
Good night.

20:48.502 --> 20:49.602
Good night, sir.

21:12.524 --> 21:13.590
Anything?

21:41.985 --> 21:43.051
Kristen?

22:19.020 --> 22:21.187
How could you lose him?

24:59.329 --> 25:00.395
Charlie!

25:01.764 --> 25:03.163
Charlie...

25:05.166 --> 25:06.332
Oh.

25:10.503 --> 25:11.803
Where have you been?

25:13.472 --> 25:14.705
Do you see it?

25:15.807 --> 25:17.073
See what, Charlie?

25:18.108 --> 25:19.374
At the window.

25:33.322 --> 25:34.488
There's nothing there.

25:35.289 --> 25:36.489
Look again.

26:55.833 --> 26:56.966
<i>Dad!</i>

27:06.874 --> 27:09.242
<i>Dad!</i>

27:48.978 --> 27:50.044
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>

27:50.478 --> 27:51.444
<i>the voice-mail of
Kristen Lawford.</i>

27:51.446 --> 27:53.486
<i>Please leave me a
message, and I'll get...</i>

27:53.980 --> 27:55.980
<i>During a
late night travel.</i>

27:55.982 --> 27:58.015
Where does Ichabod Crane
find himself,

27:58.950 --> 28:00.383
but in Sleepy Hollow.

28:01.651 --> 28:03.018
With just the very name,

28:03.419 --> 28:06.153
Irving establishes
the mood and tone,

28:07.588 --> 28:09.689
foreshadowing the
horror which is to come.

28:25.638 --> 28:26.738
Thanks.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.808
How are you holding up?

28:33.144 --> 28:34.878
Can't motivate myself.

28:35.946 --> 28:37.546
Can't motivate my students.

28:39.949 --> 28:42.416
You know, Charlie would've
been in second grade now.

28:44.318 --> 28:46.185
All I had to do was protect him.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.187
Isn't that what a father does?

28:50.189 --> 28:51.322
He protects.

28:52.991 --> 28:54.491
I couldn't even do that.

28:54.925 --> 28:56.885
Mike, listen to
what you are saying.

28:57.093 --> 28:59.027
You can't keep
beating yourself up.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.561
It won't bring him back.

29:02.163 --> 29:03.863
My son isn't dead.

29:04.331 --> 29:05.564
I feel him.

29:06.299 --> 29:08.833
And until I know
what happened to him,

29:09.501 --> 29:11.735
I am not going to
stop looking for him.

29:14.672 --> 29:17.040
Would it help if you took
another leave of absence?

29:17.042 --> 29:20.676
No.
Please, I need this.

29:21.878 --> 29:23.758
Just try to hang
in there, Mike.

29:34.221 --> 29:35.854
Taxi!

29:36.188 --> 29:37.421
Taxi, yo!

29:43.626 --> 29:45.193
Mike Hi, Rhonda, new fliers.

29:45.561 --> 29:47.795
Mike, we still have
that pile from last time.

29:48.062 --> 29:49.395
Is Detective Jordan around?

29:49.796 --> 29:50.896
Uh...

29:51.364 --> 29:53.798
He's kinda busy right now.

29:53.800 --> 29:54.899
I'll just be a second.

29:58.235 --> 29:59.868
Hi, Mike Lawford's coming in.

30:05.473 --> 30:06.773
Detective Jordan
Jesus, Mike, you can't just

30:07.007 --> 30:08.607
come into my office
any time you want to.

30:08.741 --> 30:10.981
On October 30th of last year,
there was an offender.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.844
Colin O'Malley, he was
released from Rikers Island.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.880
He served 15 years
for kidnapping,

30:17.181 --> 30:19.482
abducted a neighbor's
kid on 10th and Avenue A.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.816
I'll double check that.

30:21.317 --> 30:23.651
October 28th, Maxwell Porter
was released from Sing Sing.

30:23.653 --> 30:25.319
- They let this guy go,
- Mike...

30:25.321 --> 30:27.287
Three days before
Charlie disappeared.

30:27.289 --> 30:28.454
- He only did seven years.
- Mike...

30:28.456 --> 30:30.189
Seven years!

30:30.523 --> 30:32.023
For abducting and molesting

30:32.025 --> 30:33.991
an eight year old
boy on Stanton.

30:33.993 --> 30:35.158
I will double check it, Mike.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.325
You'll double check it?

30:36.327 --> 30:37.426
Yes!

30:39.328 --> 30:41.796
Every, and I mean every
registered offender,

30:41.798 --> 30:43.497
in every borough and
surrounding county

30:43.499 --> 30:44.831
has been double
and triple checked.

30:44.833 --> 30:46.032
Now you know this.

30:46.199 --> 30:47.432
Now, I'll take a
look at these names

30:47.434 --> 30:48.714
just in case we
missed something.

30:48.967 --> 30:50.500
But the fact still remains,

30:50.767 --> 30:52.134
that you're the last person
to be seen with your son.

30:52.136 --> 30:53.668
Oh, my God.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.270
You keep pointing
the finger at me

30:56.272 --> 30:58.038
'cause you haven't found
jack shit all year.

30:58.305 --> 31:00.105
Well, in three days
it's Halloween again!

31:00.107 --> 31:01.206
And every child will be out,

31:01.208 --> 31:02.307
and every predator knows it,

31:02.309 --> 31:04.008
and one of them took my son.

31:04.342 --> 31:05.862
And this is what you
guys do, isn't it?

31:06.009 --> 31:08.169
'Cause you're too fucking
lazy to do your jobs.

31:12.848 --> 31:14.014
Lazy?

31:14.016 --> 31:15.248
This is Charlie's file, Mike.

31:15.515 --> 31:16.795
And this is just
what's on paper.

31:16.982 --> 31:18.682
Computer's got at
least 20 times that.

31:18.684 --> 31:20.684
Each week I put
it out over NCIC.

31:20.686 --> 31:23.286
Child abuse squad,
human trafficking, FBI.

31:23.288 --> 31:25.621
I am in constant contact
with all of them.

31:26.222 --> 31:28.356
NYPD may be a lot
of things, Mike,

31:28.358 --> 31:30.758
but one thing we
are not is lazy.

31:34.162 --> 31:35.428
Now is there anything else?

31:38.832 --> 31:39.932
Find my son.

32:29.746 --> 32:30.846
Charlie!

32:33.916 --> 32:35.616
Hey, hey, stop!

32:37.051 --> 32:38.051
Hey!

32:38.053 --> 32:39.152
Charlie!

32:40.621 --> 32:41.787
Charlie!

32:46.192 --> 32:47.291
Charlie!

32:50.028 --> 32:51.595
Hey, wait!

33:02.473 --> 33:03.606
Charlie!

33:04.274 --> 33:05.374
Stop!

33:06.743 --> 33:07.809
Hey!

33:08.811 --> 33:09.877
Hey!

33:11.980 --> 33:13.046
Hey!

33:13.048 --> 33:14.147
Let me in, let me in.

33:18.484 --> 33:20.451
Charlie. Charlie!

33:23.721 --> 33:24.821
Charlie!

33:25.656 --> 33:26.788
Charlie.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.391
Charlie!

35:41.276 --> 35:42.409
Excuse me.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.144
Hello?

35:45.912 --> 35:47.012
Hi.

35:48.382 --> 35:50.815
Uh, outside, on the wall,

35:51.750 --> 35:53.083
it says, "Pay the Ghost."

35:53.717 --> 35:54.750
What are you talking about?

35:54.752 --> 35:56.151
Uh, the graffiti.

35:56.919 --> 35:57.984
"Pay the Ghost."

36:00.721 --> 36:02.641
Does anyone know
what that means?

36:42.759 --> 36:43.992
Cover the fires!

36:44.426 --> 36:45.492
Cover them.

37:00.272 --> 37:01.338
What was that?

37:01.739 --> 37:03.039
Nobody knows.

37:05.142 --> 37:08.711
She always comes out
just before Halloween.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.321
What does
"Pay the Ghost" mean?

37:14.949 --> 37:16.316
I saw it written outside.

37:22.789 --> 37:23.822
Come with me.

37:51.316 --> 37:52.416
What does it mean?

37:53.284 --> 37:55.251
Just what it says, I guess.

38:10.698 --> 38:13.933
Time's up, you need to leave.

38:27.547 --> 38:28.647
Kristen.

38:29.081 --> 38:31.121
I really...
I really need to talk to you.

38:31.716 --> 38:32.982
It's not a good time.

38:33.350 --> 38:35.470
I've got some client
designs I gotta finish.

38:37.553 --> 38:38.719
Please.

38:46.026 --> 38:50.228
So, when I saw it,
on the wall, the graffiti,

38:50.996 --> 38:52.763
I remembered something
that Charlie said to me,

38:52.765 --> 38:54.531
on that day, just before he...

38:54.533 --> 38:56.299
- Yep.
- He asked me,

38:56.533 --> 39:00.069
"Dad, can we pay the ghost?"

39:03.139 --> 39:04.205
Okay.

39:04.439 --> 39:06.359
So, what are you
telling me, Mike?

39:06.807 --> 39:09.208
I mean, we're in a city that's
full of graffiti, right?

39:10.176 --> 39:12.256
Did he ever say
anything like that to you?

39:16.014 --> 39:18.915
Kristen, have you
been hearing anything,

39:19.783 --> 39:21.950
or seeing anything
that might make you

39:22.351 --> 39:25.653
think or feel that
Charlie might be

39:25.655 --> 39:27.421
trying to communicate with you?

39:28.623 --> 39:29.623
I don't know what's
happening to me,

39:29.625 --> 39:31.691
but I really think that Charlie

39:32.325 --> 39:34.392
might be reaching out to me.

39:34.394 --> 39:36.026
Okay, I can't
do this with you.

39:36.028 --> 39:37.127
Kristen...

39:37.461 --> 39:39.381
- I can't do this.
- Kristen, please!

39:42.699 --> 39:43.765
Kristen!

39:44.199 --> 39:46.200
- Kristen!
- I can't do this.

39:46.202 --> 39:47.568
I know how it sounds,

39:47.869 --> 39:49.436
but isn't it possible?

39:49.737 --> 39:50.803
Have you seen him?

39:52.238 --> 39:53.404
Have I seen him?

39:53.805 --> 39:55.939
I see him every day.

39:56.373 --> 39:57.406
I see him on the street,

39:57.408 --> 39:58.807
I see him in the subway,

39:59.141 --> 40:00.908
I see him in his little school
when I pass his friends.

40:00.910 --> 40:02.542
I see him when
I'm in the grocery store.

40:02.544 --> 40:05.444
But every time I get closer,
it's not him.

40:05.678 --> 40:06.944
It's never him!

40:08.379 --> 40:11.247
You had to take him
to that stupid fair.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.550
- He was my boy.
- I know.

40:16.518 --> 40:18.452
- He was my son.
- I know.

40:18.719 --> 40:20.753
- He was...
- I know.

40:20.755 --> 40:23.255
Then why didn't you protect him?

40:41.006 --> 40:42.739
<i>Look how tall that guy is!</i>

40:46.943 --> 40:48.076
Smile, Dad.

40:48.510 --> 40:49.643
<i>You having fun?</i>

40:50.778 --> 40:52.078
<i>This is awesome.</i>

40:52.080 --> 40:53.412
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

44:46.297 --> 44:47.463
Kristen.

44:52.602 --> 44:53.735
Are you all right?

44:53.969 --> 44:55.235
I need to talk to you.

44:56.303 --> 44:58.904
Um, I think you were
right about Charlie.

44:59.472 --> 45:02.206
I think he is trying
to reach out to us.

45:04.909 --> 45:06.409
Come on in.

45:07.978 --> 45:09.311
What if I'm imagining it?

45:09.313 --> 45:10.612
Maybe this is all in my head,

45:10.614 --> 45:11.713
maybe it's just...

45:11.914 --> 45:12.980
No.

45:12.982 --> 45:14.381
You didn't imagine it.

45:15.182 --> 45:16.248
You didn't.

45:16.250 --> 45:17.381
It's real.

45:20.084 --> 45:21.651
I've been doing some research.

45:25.422 --> 45:26.555
Pick a date.

45:27.290 --> 45:28.323
Any one.

45:28.325 --> 45:29.524
Charlie's birthday.

45:29.526 --> 45:30.691
Perfect.

45:33.861 --> 45:35.661
These are all the
children who went missing

45:35.663 --> 45:39.063
on July 15th in New York City
over the last six years.

45:39.831 --> 45:41.398
Most of them have been found.

45:41.599 --> 45:42.898
Now let's try your birthday.

45:45.768 --> 45:47.168
Most of these children, too.

45:47.836 --> 45:49.403
But if you try Halloween?

45:56.009 --> 45:57.442
Only about half of
the missing children

45:57.444 --> 45:58.743
have been recovered.

45:59.878 --> 46:01.278
Why are you showing me this?

46:02.880 --> 46:04.947
What if all of these
missing children,

46:05.515 --> 46:07.549
on Halloween, in New York City,

46:08.484 --> 46:09.784
what if they're all connected?

46:10.285 --> 46:12.245
What if there's
something behind it?

46:13.687 --> 46:15.087
How would we find out?

46:16.522 --> 46:19.657
I have the address
of Alexis Moldanado,

46:19.659 --> 46:22.126
she disappeared on
Halloween two years ago.

46:22.527 --> 46:24.567
I think we should go
talk to her family.

46:44.379 --> 46:45.479
Hello?

46:47.716 --> 46:48.781
Hello?

47:02.026 --> 47:03.092
Excuse me.

47:07.330 --> 47:08.596
Mister Moldanado?

47:10.732 --> 47:12.812
We wanted to ask you
about your daughter.

47:13.734 --> 47:14.834
You see,

47:15.368 --> 47:16.968
our son is missing, too.

47:18.070 --> 47:19.910
Just give me some
fucking money, man.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.576
He was taken
last year on Halloween.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.413
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

47:33.349 --> 47:35.917
I gotta pay the ghost.

47:36.818 --> 47:37.978
Did your daughter say that?

47:42.022 --> 47:43.088
I was there,

47:44.490 --> 47:45.756
at Devon Bodega.

47:47.692 --> 47:48.958
And she said to me,

47:50.660 --> 47:54.429
<i>"Papa, podemos pagar
nosotros a phantasma."</i>

47:55.164 --> 47:56.430
"Can we pay the ghost?"

47:58.032 --> 47:59.265
I was distracted.

48:00.033 --> 48:02.033
I can't remember
she's in front of me.

48:03.369 --> 48:06.137
Next thing I know,
she's just gone.

48:07.739 --> 48:09.039
And one year after,

48:10.341 --> 48:11.607
I started to hear things.

48:13.810 --> 48:15.544
And then I see her.

48:15.546 --> 48:16.878
It's just flashes.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.379
It's real quick.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.414
But she's there.

48:22.682 --> 48:24.949
It's her, I know it's her.

48:26.718 --> 48:27.884
What happened?

48:33.223 --> 48:34.322
It stopped.

48:37.059 --> 48:38.125
Just like that.

48:40.695 --> 48:41.995
She disappeared on Halloween

48:41.997 --> 48:43.229
two years before Charlie.

48:43.231 --> 48:44.730
Just before she vanished,

48:44.732 --> 48:46.565
she said to her father,
"Can we pay the ghost?"

48:46.567 --> 48:48.266
Now that,
is exactly what Charlie

48:48.268 --> 48:50.167
<i>said to me before
he disappeared.</i>

48:50.169 --> 48:51.401
What the hell
you talking about?

48:51.403 --> 48:52.468
<i>Look it up.</i>

48:52.735 --> 48:53.634
On every other
night of the year,

48:53.636 --> 48:55.402
more missing children
are eventually found.

48:55.404 --> 48:56.302
But on Halloween it's different.

48:56.304 --> 48:59.271
On Halloween, more missing
children are never found.

48:59.538 --> 49:00.638
<i>I know how I sound,</i>

49:01.039 --> 49:02.339
<i>but there is
something different,</i>

49:02.573 --> 49:05.107
something mysterious out there,

49:05.109 --> 49:07.409
and it's taking
children on Halloween.

49:07.743 --> 49:10.063
I'm sorry, Mike, but I really
don't have time for this.

49:15.849 --> 49:16.949
He believe you?

49:19.085 --> 49:20.185
Would you?

49:30.095 --> 49:31.161
Carol,

49:31.562 --> 49:33.195
I need you to search
the city database.

49:33.197 --> 49:35.063
I need a printout of all
the missing children cases

49:35.065 --> 49:37.765
from October 31st in
the last five years.

49:37.767 --> 49:39.887
Just get me the ones
that haven't come back.

49:45.072 --> 49:47.606
Well, you're home.

49:50.276 --> 49:51.376
Want to come in?

49:52.911 --> 49:54.177
It's your house, too.

49:55.779 --> 49:57.880
Order dinner, have some wine.

49:58.081 --> 49:59.214
Sure.

50:55.935 --> 50:57.000
Mrs. Wen?

50:57.601 --> 50:58.667
NYPD.

50:59.101 --> 51:00.341
It's about your daughter, Mia.

51:00.701 --> 51:02.768
You find something about Mia?

51:04.303 --> 51:05.569
Can we talk in private?

51:06.938 --> 51:08.004
Just for a minute.

51:18.648 --> 51:19.914
Mrs. Wen, it's possible

51:20.181 --> 51:22.221
that there may be a
link to another case.

51:22.349 --> 51:24.309
It may help us find
out who took Mia.

51:27.353 --> 51:30.722
Two days ago,
something else happened.

51:31.557 --> 51:32.690
Tell me.

51:33.024 --> 51:34.391
I saw her.

51:35.326 --> 51:36.426
Mia?

51:36.860 --> 51:40.262
It was late at night,
I was closing store.

51:40.630 --> 51:43.131
And I think to hear
Mia's voice calling,

51:43.465 --> 51:47.066
"Mama..."

51:47.567 --> 51:50.435
I ran through traffic
to get to her,

51:50.903 --> 51:53.771
but when I arrived,
Mia was gone.

51:54.405 --> 51:57.639
Is it possible that
you just imagined it?

51:58.540 --> 52:00.941
It must have
been somebody else.

52:01.342 --> 52:03.976
Mia would not have
run away from me.

52:04.644 --> 52:05.744
What does that mean?

52:06.045 --> 52:07.311
What you heard her calling?

52:07.712 --> 52:10.380
"Mama..."?

52:10.382 --> 52:11.547
Yes.

52:11.714 --> 52:14.715
Mama, save me from the ghost.

54:18.251 --> 54:19.850
I don't know.

54:20.618 --> 54:23.953
They were wearing old costumes.

54:24.454 --> 54:25.954
Was Charlie one of them?

54:26.722 --> 54:29.790
I mean, there were so
many of them, I don't know.

54:33.094 --> 54:35.294
Maybe it's time to bring
someone into the house.

54:36.197 --> 54:39.532
Like a psychic or a
medium or something.

54:41.968 --> 54:43.768
Those people are frauds.

55:16.129 --> 55:18.330
On the phone I asked if
you could locate an object?

55:18.332 --> 55:19.898
Yes, uh...

55:20.900 --> 55:22.980
He used to take this
everywhere with him.

55:24.069 --> 55:25.369
He still sleeps with it.

55:27.105 --> 55:28.171
He used to.

55:33.309 --> 55:35.410
So, how does this work?

55:39.314 --> 55:42.015
It's about tapping into the
right frequency, that's all.

55:43.350 --> 55:46.685
If something was here,
I won't need to find it.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.320
I just need to let it find me.

56:27.522 --> 56:29.623
No, nothing.

56:30.024 --> 56:31.691
Is there any other rooms

56:31.693 --> 56:34.960
that he spent a significant
amount of time in?

56:35.194 --> 56:37.762
When we first moved in
he had a hard time sleeping.

56:38.029 --> 56:40.109
He spent a lot of time
in our room, sure.

57:12.091 --> 57:13.224
It's here.

57:13.558 --> 57:14.624
What's here?

57:16.059 --> 57:17.926
It has all the children.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.480
What children?
Do you... Charlie?

58:08.033 --> 58:10.034
She saw it.

58:10.568 --> 58:12.408
The thing that
takes the children.

58:12.468 --> 58:13.734
The thing that has my son.

58:13.736 --> 58:15.576
That thing
that has your son.

58:16.270 --> 58:18.404
You told me that woman was
flying around your ceiling.

58:18.406 --> 58:20.606
I believe in facts, logic.

58:21.207 --> 58:22.473
And all I know is that a lot of

58:22.475 --> 58:23.941
bad shit happens
around you, Mike.

58:24.375 --> 58:25.942
And until I figure out what
the hell happened around here,

58:25.944 --> 58:27.443
don't be leaving
town any time soon.

58:27.445 --> 58:28.777
I'm sorry, are you implying

58:29.078 --> 58:31.198
that my husband had
anything to do with this?

58:32.214 --> 58:33.347
I'm just doing my job.

58:39.453 --> 58:41.353
I'm really sorry.

59:06.178 --> 59:07.378
I can't sleep.

59:08.646 --> 59:09.712
Can you?

59:10.513 --> 59:11.913
Yeah, I'm gonna try.

59:15.650 --> 59:16.716
I'm just gonna...

59:17.317 --> 59:18.550
I'll be downstairs.

59:19.518 --> 59:20.651
Hey, Mike...

59:21.285 --> 59:22.351
Mike.

59:24.954 --> 59:26.020
Good night.

01:01:47.617 --> 01:01:48.717
Kristen?

01:02:06.734 --> 01:02:07.800
Hey...

01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:09.167
Kristen?

01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:10.734
You okay?

01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:16.738
I'm cold, Dad.

01:02:17.573 --> 01:02:19.040
It's cold here.

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:21.575
Charlie?

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:23.542
She's coming, Dad.

01:02:24.977 --> 01:02:26.077
I'm scared.

01:02:27.179 --> 01:02:28.546
Please save me.

01:02:34.419 --> 01:02:35.519
I will.

01:02:36.621 --> 01:02:37.721
I will, Charlie.

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:40.389
Tell me where you are.

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.592
Kristen!

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.428
Kristen!

01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:12.218
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:03:13.153 --> 01:03:14.219
It's okay.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.353
What happened?

01:03:16.954 --> 01:03:18.187
You were cutting yourself.

01:03:19.656 --> 01:03:20.789
You don't remember?

01:03:22.258 --> 01:03:23.491
No.

01:03:23.493 --> 01:03:24.859
I heard Charlie's voice.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.027
He said, "Come and save me."

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:29.528
Where? Where is he?

01:03:39.805 --> 01:03:41.672
Mike, what is that?

01:04:28.817 --> 01:04:30.250
Jesus Christ.

01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:44.896
It doesn't
appear to be Greek or Roman.

01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:47.364
Interesting.

01:04:52.803 --> 01:04:54.069
"The Celtic Goddess,

01:04:54.303 --> 01:04:55.903
the most revered of
all Celtic symbols."

01:04:55.905 --> 01:04:57.745
There were no
Celts in America.

01:04:58.206 --> 01:04:59.472
And their original culture

01:04:59.739 --> 01:05:01.859
ceased to exist over
1,000 years ago, so...

01:05:02.007 --> 01:05:04.675
There was a small group of
Celtic reconstructionalists

01:05:04.677 --> 01:05:06.309
that immigrated from Ireland.

01:05:06.543 --> 01:05:08.877
New York was a big
trading post by then.

01:05:08.879 --> 01:05:10.078
What happened to them?

01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:17.083
The influenza epidemic
in New York, 1679.

01:05:17.085 --> 01:05:20.052
"When it struck,
it devastated the population.

01:05:20.054 --> 01:05:22.421
Some colonists
accused an Irish woman

01:05:22.423 --> 01:05:25.590
of using black magic to bring
about the deadly epidemic.

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.458
They burned her at the stake."

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.127
Does it say in
there what her name was?

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.528
Not in this document,

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.062
but I'm sure I could find it.

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:35.763
I'll check the archives tonight.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.065
This happened when New York

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:41.068
was still a rural
settlement, 300 years ago.

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:44.671
At that time, the trading
post would've been

01:05:44.673 --> 01:05:46.506
just along this park, right?

01:05:47.241 --> 01:05:48.441
Yes.

01:05:49.576 --> 01:05:51.610
There's an old
church in that area.

01:05:51.612 --> 01:05:53.678
Saint Joseph's.
It's here.

01:05:54.413 --> 01:05:56.747
A small Irish community
still gathers there each year

01:05:56.749 --> 01:05:59.750
to celebrate Halloween
in the Celtic tradition.

01:05:59.752 --> 01:06:01.818
- Tonight.
- Can we go there?

01:06:02.019 --> 01:06:04.179
What do you think you're
going to find there?

01:06:06.356 --> 01:06:07.422
I don't know.

01:06:09.358 --> 01:06:10.558
Happy Halloween, Jordan.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.659
What've you got for me?

01:06:11.893 --> 01:06:13.193
You're not gonna believe it.

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:15.115
Got a real trick
or treat for you.

01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:16.862
You ready for this?

01:06:28.106 --> 01:06:29.466
What the hell am I
looking at, Ray?

01:06:29.606 --> 01:06:32.174
Her organs or what's
left of them anyway.

01:06:33.142 --> 01:06:35.022
It's like she's
been set on fire,

01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:39.512
from the inside,
like spontaneous combustion.

01:07:49.045 --> 01:07:50.178
Excuse us.

01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:54.415
Hello, welcome, welcome.

01:07:54.849 --> 01:07:56.749
I don't think I've seen
you folks here before.

01:07:57.016 --> 01:07:58.916
We were wondering
about the song.

01:07:59.384 --> 01:08:00.851
Can you tell us about it?

01:08:00.853 --> 01:08:02.118
Of course.

01:08:02.519 --> 01:08:04.679
It's the Portal song,
it's played during Sawan.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.940
It's meant to honor and
welcome the spirits.

01:08:07.222 --> 01:08:08.589
This place was home

01:08:08.856 --> 01:08:11.023
to the first Sawan
celebration in the country.

01:08:11.025 --> 01:08:12.357
The first Halloween.

01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:14.958
Our son was abducted
last year on Halloween.

01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:17.292
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.028
For almost a year after he
disappeared, there was nothing.

01:08:20.295 --> 01:08:23.029
Then two days ago,
we began to hear his voice.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.765
Moments when we could see him.

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:27.567
I'm just a school
teacher from Bayside.

01:08:27.968 --> 01:08:30.435
We get together here
every Halloween for fun.

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:33.971
I'm truly sorry, but I don't
know anything about your son.

01:08:33.974 --> 01:08:35.372
No, no, please.

01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:36.740
No, wait, please

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.180
can you tell us about
the Celtic Goddess?

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:41.242
I did something to
myself last night

01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:42.910
without having any memory of it.

01:08:46.015 --> 01:08:47.335
Do you recognize this symbol?

01:08:55.255 --> 01:08:57.122
This is the waxing moon.

01:08:57.323 --> 01:08:59.890
You can tell because
the crescent faces left.

01:08:59.893 --> 01:09:01.259
It means Maiden.

01:09:01.693 --> 01:09:02.693
And the waning moon?

01:09:02.694 --> 01:09:04.327
The crescent faces right.

01:09:04.328 --> 01:09:06.228
It means Crone.

01:09:06.495 --> 01:09:09.462
It's the most devastating
of all the Pagan symbols.

01:09:10.163 --> 01:09:11.264
Why?

01:09:11.598 --> 01:09:12.930
It is said that hate made her

01:09:12.933 --> 01:09:14.853
forget her true
nature as a mother.

01:09:15.768 --> 01:09:17.234
Could she have taken our son?

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:20.904
It is believed that
there was one day a year,

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:23.305
when the Crone could take
someone to the other side.

01:09:24.341 --> 01:09:26.175
The final day of Sawan,

01:09:26.176 --> 01:09:28.609
when the boundary between
the two worlds dissolves

01:09:28.612 --> 01:09:32.613
and she returns to take three
children on Halloween night.

01:09:32.615 --> 01:09:34.680
So, the Crone is a ghost

01:09:34.683 --> 01:09:36.582
and you pay the ghost
with your child.

01:09:36.584 --> 01:09:39.283
That's why the
children burn dolls tonight.

01:09:39.752 --> 01:09:42.487
It's an offering,
so they won't be taken.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.589
So, if our son was taken,

01:09:46.691 --> 01:09:48.457
does it mean that he's dead?

01:09:49.026 --> 01:09:50.126
All that I can
tell you is

01:09:50.127 --> 01:09:51.894
that at the beginning of Sawan,

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:54.396
as the door between the
two worlds slowly opens,

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:56.598
only the children
taken the previous year

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.933
can still reach
out to this world.

01:09:59.301 --> 01:10:01.502
And they are the only
ones who can be saved.

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:04.904
But only until midnight,
that's when the portal

01:10:04.906 --> 01:10:06.639
between the two
worlds closes again.

01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:07.973
Two hours.

01:10:08.607 --> 01:10:10.541
Where, where do we find him?

01:10:10.543 --> 01:10:13.110
Legend says that in the
days before Halloween,

01:10:13.112 --> 01:10:16.512
the Crone can be heard
crying for her lost children.

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:18.813
The crying woman.

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:21.181
I know the place.

01:10:21.549 --> 01:10:23.716
That's why I saw him,
he tried to show me.

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:25.150
To bring me there.

01:10:40.932 --> 01:10:42.032
- All right.
<i>- Mike.</i>

01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:43.366
Yes, Hannah?

01:10:43.368 --> 01:10:45.634
I found her name.
Annie Sawquin.

01:10:45.935 --> 01:10:47.635
Her name was Annie Sawquin.

01:10:48.003 --> 01:10:49.103
Tell me.

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:51.104
She was a young widow
with three children,

01:10:51.106 --> 01:10:53.172
living on the first
New York settlement.

01:10:55.843 --> 01:10:57.809
Get inside!
Now, children.

01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:00.744
<i>On Halloween night of 1679,</i>

01:11:00.746 --> 01:11:03.012
<i>an angry mob
approached her home.</i>

01:11:10.018 --> 01:11:11.952
<i>The influenza outbreak
had infected</i>

01:11:11.954 --> 01:11:13.286
<i>most of the settlement,</i>

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.087
<i>and many people
blamed Annie's family</i>

01:11:15.089 --> 01:11:17.255
<i>because of their Celtic beliefs.</i>

01:11:18.423 --> 01:11:20.257
<i>The crowd broke
into their house,</i>

01:11:20.259 --> 01:11:22.025
<i>looking to punish
her and the children</i>

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:23.993
<i>for the misery
they were suffering.</i>

01:11:26.396 --> 01:11:27.462
No!

01:11:29.865 --> 01:11:31.665
Where's the young'uns, Annie?

01:11:31.966 --> 01:11:33.132
No!

01:11:40.305 --> 01:11:41.471
Mother!

01:11:46.075 --> 01:11:47.708
<i>But ultimately,
they were discovered</i>

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.242
<i>and captured by the mob.</i>

01:11:54.147 --> 01:11:56.948
On the same night, they
burned them at the stake.

01:11:58.984 --> 01:12:01.251
<i>As the children
cried out for mercy,</i>

01:12:01.253 --> 01:12:03.953
<i>their mother was forced
to watch on in horror.</i>

01:12:05.456 --> 01:12:06.988
<i>With her last breath,</i>

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.057
she swore to return
every year on that day

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:12.559
and replace her three
slaughtered children

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:13.993
<i>with those from the living.</i>

01:12:15.129 --> 01:12:17.796
<i>That's all the
information I have, Mike.</i>

01:12:17.798 --> 01:12:20.064
Thank you.

01:12:28.472 --> 01:12:29.637
Watch out!

01:13:52.544 --> 01:13:53.777
It's 10:15.

01:13:54.078 --> 01:13:55.044
You need you
to go find Charlie.

01:13:55.046 --> 01:13:56.612
He needs you, I'm fine.

01:13:56.813 --> 01:13:58.213
Stay here, buddy,
we're gonna get you fixed up.

01:13:58.215 --> 01:13:59.815
Only when I know
you're all right.

01:14:01.049 --> 01:14:02.449
She going to be okay?

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.116
She'll be fine, sir.

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:06.670
We're gonna need to do
some X-rays, though.

01:14:07.686 --> 01:14:08.952
Let me clean that up for you.

01:14:09.386 --> 01:14:10.586
Police are on their way.

01:14:11.854 --> 01:14:12.954
Go.

01:14:15.057 --> 01:14:16.290
Hey!

01:15:16.714 --> 01:15:17.780
Hello?

01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:20.349
Anybody here?

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:22.483
Hello?

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:27.821
Anybody?

01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:34.793
Somebody there?

01:15:50.974 --> 01:15:52.541
Can somebody help me?

01:15:58.014 --> 01:15:59.347
Why is everybody gone?

01:15:59.781 --> 01:16:00.847
It's Halloween.

01:16:01.114 --> 01:16:02.581
Ghosts are all out.

01:16:03.783 --> 01:16:05.183
Why'd you come back?

01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:06.650
I need your help.

01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:09.652
How do I find the crying woman?

01:16:10.353 --> 01:16:11.920
What do you want from her?

01:16:12.655 --> 01:16:13.755
My child back.

01:16:16.925 --> 01:16:18.225
Give me your watch.

01:16:21.862 --> 01:16:24.430
You wanna cross over to
the other side or not?

01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:32.737
You can see?

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:35.239
I'm blind as a bat.

01:16:36.608 --> 01:16:37.708
Not deaf.

01:16:39.944 --> 01:16:41.044
Take me to her.

01:16:50.054 --> 01:16:51.553
The portal is open.

01:16:52.021 --> 01:16:54.589
What you're looking for
is on the other side.

01:16:55.691 --> 01:16:57.925
You better be back
before midnight.

01:16:58.326 --> 01:16:59.426
What happens then?

01:16:59.693 --> 01:17:00.926
Halloween's over.

01:17:01.193 --> 01:17:05.129
You're not back,
you'll be trapped in there.

01:17:08.032 --> 01:17:09.198
Oh, wait.

01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:11.633
Might need this.

01:17:12.668 --> 01:17:14.068
A lot more than I do.

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.804
You will pay!

01:19:11.077 --> 01:19:12.911
Annie Sawquin.

01:21:34.183 --> 01:21:35.249
Charlie?

01:22:19.594 --> 01:22:20.694
Charlie,

01:22:22.029 --> 01:22:23.162
I'm here, son.

01:22:23.696 --> 01:22:24.762
I'm here.

01:22:29.634 --> 01:22:30.834
Where are you, Charlie?

01:22:44.948 --> 01:22:46.048
My son.

01:22:47.617 --> 01:22:48.650
My boy.

01:22:48.652 --> 01:22:49.951
Is it really you, Dad?

01:22:50.752 --> 01:22:52.452
I missed you so much.

01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:56.121
I'll take you home now.

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.893
Can we come, too?

01:23:05.329 --> 01:23:07.296
This is Mia and Pablo, Dad.

01:23:07.563 --> 01:23:09.030
We were brought here together.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.400
There's no time.

01:23:13.934 --> 01:23:15.167
We have to stay together.

01:23:40.457 --> 01:23:41.690
Come on, keep moving.

01:23:42.158 --> 01:23:43.358
We're almost there.

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.353
Get behind me.

01:24:20.358 --> 01:24:21.691
Dad!

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:41.774
Dad!

01:24:48.414 --> 01:24:49.480
No!

01:25:01.724 --> 01:25:03.057
Help him!

01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.155
Dad, the bridge!

01:25:44.123 --> 01:25:45.189
Come on!

01:25:53.297 --> 01:25:54.463
Let's go!

01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:20.154
I got you.

01:26:29.831 --> 01:26:31.298
Put your arm around my neck.

01:26:45.646 --> 01:26:47.313
I got you, Dad.

01:26:56.656 --> 01:26:57.856
Let's go home.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.706
Charlie?

01:27:16.974 --> 01:27:18.074
Mom.

01:27:31.487 --> 01:27:32.753
Come here.

01:27:33.154 --> 01:27:34.554
Oh, my goodness.

01:27:42.462 --> 01:27:43.528
Where were you?

01:27:43.862 --> 01:27:45.028
Where were you?

01:27:45.329 --> 01:27:46.595
At the Halloween Fair.

01:27:47.196 --> 01:27:49.030
Dad and I had so much fun.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:50.430
There it is.

01:27:51.732 --> 01:27:53.032
I thought I lost it.

01:27:55.702 --> 01:27:57.235
He doesn't remember anything?

01:28:00.839 --> 01:28:03.707
Dad promised me next year
I can be a superhero.

01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:05.108
You'll be a superhero.

01:28:05.576 --> 01:28:07.496
You're gonna be a
great superhero.

01:28:08.378 --> 01:28:09.811
Why are you crying?

01:28:12.548 --> 01:28:13.948
I'm really happy to see you.

01:28:14.416 --> 01:28:15.496
That's all, that's all.

01:28:15.883 --> 01:28:17.450
I'm just happy to see you.

01:28:19.986 --> 01:28:21.119
Thank you.
