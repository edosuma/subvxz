00:22.890 --> 00:24.289
- Morning, Dad.
- Good morning, honey.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.692
Do you mind
sitting at the counter?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.527
I have a Christmas Council
meeting this morning.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.497
This is your second
emergency meeting this week.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.966
Is there more Christmas trouble
here in Midway again?

00:34.001 --> 00:37.770
Nope. Actually, I have news
that could change everything.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.205
Well, it must be special news,

00:40.241 --> 00:42.708
because you broke out
your mama's recipe,

00:42.743 --> 00:43.709
and you know,
she only baked this

00:43.744 --> 00:45.644
for extra-special occasions.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.679
So... what is it?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.448
You're about to find out.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.383
Morning, Aria!

00:51.419 --> 00:52.718
- Hey.
- We made it.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.520
Although, I think
I might have concussion.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.822
Oh, hush.
I was braking for the elk.

00:56.857 --> 00:57.956
No elk.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.658
Darling, you saw the antlers!

00:59.693 --> 01:01.160
Come on, ladies.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.862
There's fresh coffee
and this year's featured pies,

01:03.898 --> 01:06.632
Santa's Secret Strawberry Pie
and Mistletoe-Man Meringue

01:06.667 --> 01:07.666
are on the table.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.168
Mistletoe-Man Meringue!

01:09.203 --> 01:10.536
Your mom's favorite.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.971
Come on, Leslie,
let's sample

01:13.007 --> 01:15.140
what's sure to be
a best-seller this season.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.643
- Morning, Aria.
- Hey, Craig!

01:17.678 --> 01:20.379
Your dad told me
about that oven door.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.213
I should be able--

01:21.248 --> 01:22.581
No worries.
I've already fixed it.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.383
Really?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.585
Well, I know how busy you are
this time of year,

01:26.620 --> 01:27.719
so I found a video online.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.321
You know, you don't have
to do everything on your own,

01:29.356 --> 01:30.756
you can ask for help.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.724
You see, that would require

01:32.760 --> 01:35.427
my darling daughter to let
somebody else have control.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.995
You'd be luckier
to get Santa

01:37.031 --> 01:39.565
to give you
the reins to his sleigh.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.935
Funny. Thanks, Dad.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.403
All right.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.205
Well, welcome,
Christmas Council.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.339
Let's begin.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.509
I have big, big news.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.344
As you know,

01:52.379 --> 01:54.713
since that high-tech resort
started offering

01:54.748 --> 01:57.616
those extreme ski and snowboard
Christmas packages,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.685
businesses
are really struggling.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.786
Tell me about it.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.555
The Sugarplum Lodge is stuck
at permanent vacancy.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.858
If we don't bring back
the holiday traffic,

02:05.893 --> 02:08.393
we just can't continue
Christmas in Midway.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.695
You're right.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.763
Well, don't be
so cheerful about it, dear.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.299
I think
I may have a solution.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.569
Please direct your attention
to the TV.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.709
I love this show.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.277
Mm-hmm.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.678
<i>Join me, Sterling Masters,</i>

02:26.714 --> 02:29.581
<i>as we go off the beaten path
for extraordinary adventures</i>

02:29.617 --> 02:31.216
<i>in unique locations.</i>

02:31.252 --> 02:33.519
<i>This... is Masters of Travel.</i>

02:34.688 --> 02:35.821
Whoa, honey, honey,
slow down.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.256
You're missing
the whole program.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.657
Ah, that's just for effect.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.859
It's the ending
that I want you to see.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.229
<i>Each year,</i>

02:44.265 --> 02:46.899
<i>I hand-pick one city
to be our featured destination</i>

02:46.934 --> 02:49.101
<i>for Sterling Master's
"Big Holiday Adventure"</i>

02:49.136 --> 02:50.269
<i>for our website.</i>

02:50.304 --> 02:53.405
<i>I've narrowed it down

02:53.440 --> 02:54.573

02:54.608 --> 02:55.574
<i>Austin, Texas...</i>

02:56.644 --> 02:57.576

02:57.611 --> 02:59.645
<i>Be sure to check out
my website</i>

02:59.680 --> 03:04.082
<i>to find out who will be chosen
as my Big Holiday Adventure.</i>

03:04.118 --> 03:05.584
<i>I'll be showcasing

03:05.619 --> 03:07.319
<i>holiday attractions, events,</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:08.520

03:11.158 --> 03:13.625
<i>for the ultimate
Christmas experience.</i>

03:13.661 --> 03:16.695
If Sterling Masters
likes the road less traveled,

03:16.730 --> 03:18.130
then Midway is a shoo-in.

03:18.165 --> 03:21.667
Right?
I mean, can you imagine?

03:21.702 --> 03:25.470
<i>The</i> Sterling Masters
writing about our Midway.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.172
Are we gonna be on TV?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.608
I have extensive
on-camera experience.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.842
Infomercials.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.778
It's still acting.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.514
No. We'll actually be
featured on his website.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.883
I mean, the show
is entertaining and all,

03:37.918 --> 03:40.018
but his writing
is incredible.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.321
He has
the way of, I don't know,

03:42.356 --> 03:44.022
making you feel like
you're there with him

03:44.058 --> 03:45.624
on his travels.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.226
I'm such a huge fan.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.327
It's true.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.028
He's a huge travel influencer.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.463
One mention
from Sterling Masters

03:51.498 --> 03:53.999
could put a forgotten city
back on the map.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.969
Will we get to meet
the handsome world traveler?

03:57.004 --> 03:59.705
I'm happy to host
a welcoming party.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.639
Well, I'm sure,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.207
but let's not
plan any parties just yet.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.476
We won't know
if we're selected

04:04.511 --> 04:07.012
until Sterling's first article
is published.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.880
We knew you'd save
Christmas in Midway.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.516
If anyone could,
it's you, Aria.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.524
Midway? Really?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.060
Alex, hey!

04:22.096 --> 04:23.095
I knew you'd be excited.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.197
I thought Tokyo was a lock.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.665
You know I hate writing
about small towns.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.066
They're all the same.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.368
Why don't you go
help decorate the office?

04:29.403 --> 04:30.135
Thanks.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.106
The lights in Tokyo
are amazing,

04:34.141 --> 04:36.341
but...

04:36.377 --> 04:39.411
Midway has Christmas charm
like the North Pole.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.346
No flash, all spirit.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.515
Just think,

04:43.550 --> 04:45.684
"Big Holiday Adventure
in Small-town America."

04:45.719 --> 04:47.386
Has a nice ring to it.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.221
Oh, does it?

04:49.256 --> 04:50.222
And the real reason?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.623
You think I'm lying?

04:51.659 --> 04:52.591
Yeah.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.593
How do you know?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.729
Four years
as your college roommate,

04:57.765 --> 04:59.031
five years as your ghostwriter,

04:59.066 --> 05:00.265
ten years as your best friend.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.400
Shall I do more math?

05:01.435 --> 05:02.367
Okay, fine.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.403
I have scheduled
some promotional appearances

05:04.438 --> 05:05.437
on the West Coast.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.705
I can be "writing"

05:06.740 --> 05:08.307
the Big Holiday Adventure
in Utah

05:08.342 --> 05:09.708
and take a quick flight
to California.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.942
Logistically,
it makes more sense

05:10.978 --> 05:12.210
to have it in Midwest
than Tokyo.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.078
Midway.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.547
Same thing.
Forget about my schedule.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.149
The town is perfect.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.451
This town
is the size of the lobby.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.886
That's an exaggeration.

05:20.921 --> 05:21.987
What happens
when someone discovers

05:22.022 --> 05:24.790
that I'm the writer
behind Big Holiday Adventure,

05:24.825 --> 05:25.924
let alone everything else,

05:25.959 --> 05:28.327
and not Sterling Masters?

05:28.362 --> 05:29.661
Just do
what we've always done.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.962
If someone asks,
you don't know me.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.597
I'll pop in when I can.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.665
What?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.400
You write great articles,

05:35.436 --> 05:37.402
I work on my TV travel features.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.438
It's a two-man job.
Always has been.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.305
It's not just that.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.474
People like Christmas
in big cities

05:42.509 --> 05:43.809
because they have variety.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.812
Festivities a step above
a mall Santa.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.480
Have you seen the pictures?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.815
They're adorable!

05:49.850 --> 05:51.650
Like something
out of Santa's storybook.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.919
Look! They even have reindeer.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.454
Doesn't get much more Christmas
than that.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.788
That is an elk.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.625
What does a reindeer look like?

06:00.661 --> 06:03.261
Small towns notice outsiders.

06:03.297 --> 06:04.796
People are
going to ask questions.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.998
I guarantee it.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.633
You're the best writer I know.
Make something up.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.702
Besides, you and I both know

06:10.738 --> 06:13.004
that if anyone finds out
that you

06:13.040 --> 06:16.141
are actually "Sterling Masters,
the travel writer,"

06:16.176 --> 06:18.009
you violate your contract

06:18.045 --> 06:20.245
and we risk
losing our little empire.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.485
This is definitely
Sterling Masters' empire.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.786
Are you kidding?

06:27.821 --> 06:30.021
You're the one who figured out
how to make traveling a career,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.224
for both of us.
You.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.059
We make a great team.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.294
Always have.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.863
Yeah.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.998
I give up.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.669
I emailed your flight info,
so go pack your mittens.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.338
Midway it is!

06:46.373 --> 06:48.240
I'll be the ghost
of Christmas Present.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.841
No one will even know
that I'm there.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.878
It's gotta be a reindeer.

07:02.289 --> 07:05.757
♪ Deck the halls
With boughs of holly ♪

07:05.793 --> 07:09.060
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la ♪

07:10.597 --> 07:14.266
♪ 'Tis the season
To be jolly ♪

07:14.301 --> 07:16.435
Oh, my...

07:16.470 --> 07:18.103
Hey!

07:18.138 --> 07:20.439
This is beautiful, honey.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.507
You did this all by yourself?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.009
I would've helped you.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.711
Despite your micromanaging,
I would've helped you.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.180
No need.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.282
Just a few final touches
and it'll be ready.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.716
These lights aren't on, though.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.619
Yeah, that outlet,
it's overloaded,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.888
but I have an extension cord
to fix it later.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.957
I wanted to showcase
all of the ornaments

07:38.992 --> 07:40.258
for the silent auction.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.727
My, oh, my.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.197
Where did you get these?
From Santa's workshop direct?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.565
Close.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.867
Special-ordered from Germany.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.969
Sterling Masters
featured it

07:51.004 --> 07:52.637
on last year's
Big Holiday Adventure.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.040
They look expensive.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.708
You know, honey,

07:56.743 --> 07:58.743
the auction
is supposed to raise money

07:58.779 --> 07:59.878
for the parks and rec center.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.480
What-- What if
this Sterling thing

08:01.515 --> 08:02.714
just doesn't pan out?

08:02.749 --> 08:04.616
Where's your Christmas faith?

08:04.651 --> 08:05.717
You're right.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.052
They're beautiful!

08:07.087 --> 08:08.820
And they're gonna
attract bidders.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.991
And-And it's perfect,
and I am so proud of you.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.093
Let's just hope they're perfect
for Sterling Masters, too.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.828
He'll be here.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.330
Crossing my fingers.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.798
I'm gonna help you right now.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.867
No, go home.
I'm almost done here.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.236
Okay. Goodnight.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.873
Goodnight.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.280
So, apparently, this town
eats dinner at exactly sundown.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.616
You know where
I would not have this problem?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.352
<i>A place called Tokyo.</i>

08:40.386 --> 08:41.785
You shouldn't
be a late-night eater.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.355
It's bad for digestion.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.156
Could be why you're so cranky.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.625
Thank you, Mother.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.293
Still starving.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.295
<i>Worst case,
the gas station has to be open.</i>

08:50.330 --> 08:51.196
<i>You're not in Siberia.</i>

08:51.231 --> 08:53.665
Hang on, hold on,
we may have a winner.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.034
Looks like the...
"Mistletoe Diner"

08:56.069 --> 08:57.302
still has its lights on.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.970
<i>There you go!</i>

08:59.006 --> 09:00.839
<i>Sounds like
a Christmas dream come true.</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:03.141
<i>Who needs a big city, right?</i>

09:03.176 --> 09:04.976
Right. I'm running in.
I'll call you later.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.019
Hello?

09:15.422 --> 09:16.988
Hello?

09:17.024 --> 09:21.359
♪ O, come all ye faithful ♪

09:21.395 --> 09:25.964
♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪

09:25.999 --> 09:30.135
♪ O, come, ye
O, come, ye ♪

09:30.170 --> 09:32.137
- ♪ To Bethle-- ♪
- Excuse me.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.205
I'm sorry.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.040
Didn't mean to startle you.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.408
That's okay.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.476
I'm so happy that you're open.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.245
Oh, we're not. Sorry.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.080
My staff just left.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.415
Pie? Coffee?

09:43.450 --> 09:44.516
A mint?

09:44.551 --> 09:45.984
Anything, I am desperate.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.018
What are you doing?

09:47.054 --> 09:48.820
I am assisting.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.422
I have it under control.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.357
My great catch
suggests otherwise.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.893
Be careful.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.027
It took me all day
to hang this.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.629
Done!

09:58.632 --> 09:59.731
Pie?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.166
Told you, we're closed.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.034
Looks like you're missing
some lights on this tree.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.803
Wait, wait, wait!

10:06.406 --> 10:07.906
That outlet was overloaded.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.742
Yeah. Fixable?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.945
Yeah. But I told you
I didn't need any assistance.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.680
Yeah, you really did.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.682
So...

10:17.718 --> 10:18.717
how about that pie?

10:20.754 --> 10:24.255
All right, come on.
Just don't break anything else.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.626
I'll be honest.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.694
I did not have high hopes
for this place,

10:29.730 --> 10:32.130
but this may be the best pie
I've ever had.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.432
Should I take that
as a compliment?

10:34.468 --> 10:35.934
Well, you know
small-town diners.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.268
It's a toss-up.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.603
This is clearly not from a box.

10:38.639 --> 10:39.904
Give my regards
to the owner, please.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.573
- You just did.
- Really?

10:41.608 --> 10:42.774
Family business.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.476
Mom made the pies
and the menus,

10:44.511 --> 10:46.311
and Dad ran the books.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.980
I took over the family business
after he retired.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.115
Well, with food this good,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.983
you guys
need to stay open later.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.119
My favorite diners,
they're open 24 hours.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.120
Where are you from?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.621
San Francisco.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.723
You're a long way from home,
Mister...?

10:58.759 --> 10:59.591
Just Alex.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.627
You sound like you're a long way
from home yourself.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.129
Mama always said,

11:04.164 --> 11:06.765
"Aria, you can take the girl
out of North Carolina,

11:06.800 --> 11:10.001
but you can't take
North Carolina out of the girl."

11:10.037 --> 11:12.637
So, what brings you
to our humble Midway?

11:12.673 --> 11:13.805
I know it wasn't to visit

11:13.840 --> 11:16.508
this "questionable"
small-town diner.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.410
I'm working on
my mystery novel.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.412
Thought the mountain air
might clear my head.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.479
So here I am.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.348
What's going with the ornaments?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.116
You throwing a party?

11:25.152 --> 11:28.486
It's our silent auction
for our Christmas Council's

11:28.522 --> 11:30.355
annual fundraiser for
Midway's parks and rec center.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.490
Wow. Midway loves Christmas.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.694
Mistletoe Diner,
Christmas Council...

11:35.729 --> 11:36.961
there's a Sugarplum Lodge?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.129
Mm-hmm.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.798
Is Santa's workshop nearby?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.101
Come on. Really?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.202
I mean, I didn't expect
a small town

11:44.237 --> 11:45.070
in the middle of nowhere

11:45.105 --> 11:48.039
to be so creative
about the holidays.

11:48.075 --> 11:48.873
Well, is that something

11:48.909 --> 11:50.942
only reserved
for the big cities?

11:50.977 --> 11:53.211
Small towns settle
for a Mall Santa?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.213
Honestly,
it does tend to be that way.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.881
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.650
I hope it puts you
on Santa's nice list,

11:58.685 --> 11:59.984
because your attitude won't.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.021
How long are you here for?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.322
Three weeks.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.390
Really? Over Christmas.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.392
What about your family?

12:07.427 --> 12:08.860
On their annual
Christmas cruise.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.161
Well, I'm sure
you'll be missed.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.030
You know,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.832
there's one thing we have
in common with San Francisco.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.700
- What's that?
- To-go boxes.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.669
Oh. Right.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.538
May I please have
this whole pie?

12:20.574 --> 12:21.673
I'll ring you up.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.975
Thank you.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.226
Hey, Leslie.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.327
Hi. Thanks for coming

12:42.362 --> 12:43.895
and helping me
decorate the tree.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.597
I lost another front desk clerk
to the new ski resort.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.432
You're a lifesaver.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.734
Well, how's everything else
around here,

12:49.770 --> 12:51.603
other than losing
half your staff?

12:51.638 --> 12:53.104
Couple of new guests.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.839
One's pretty cute.
Want me to introduce you?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.174
Pass.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.276
You'll never know
if someone will measure up

12:58.311 --> 12:59.778
to your impossible
fairy-tale standards

12:59.813 --> 13:01.212
if you don't even
give them a chance.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.581
I do not have
fairy-tale standards.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.251
Then what would you call
that "Mistletoe Man" of yours?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.586
The impossible
devoted gentleman

13:08.622 --> 13:10.221
who climbs
the highest mountains,

13:10.257 --> 13:11.756
the tallest trees,
et cetera, et cetera,

13:11.792 --> 13:13.558
all to prove his love?

13:13.593 --> 13:15.226
It's more than that.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.797
A true Mistletoe Man is like
a gift from the universe,

13:18.832 --> 13:20.431
not some random lodger

13:20.467 --> 13:22.100
your best friend
thought was cute.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.201
After that break-up
in New York,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.703
you might as well have
shut yourself up in a tower.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.472
Moving on.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.042
So, any interesting guests
check in lately?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.410
You think I'd be standing here

13:32.445 --> 13:34.813
talking about
fictional Mistletoe Men

13:34.848 --> 13:36.314
if Sterling Masters
had checked in?

13:36.349 --> 13:37.982
Christmas is three weeks away.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.117
He should be here by now.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.386
Maybe we didn't win.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.588
Maybe he rented a cabin.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.623
We won't know for sure
until his first article posts.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.758
Stay positive.

13:46.793 --> 13:47.792
I just hope

13:47.828 --> 13:50.261
that I get the chance
to thank him in person.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.830
I mean,
not just for coming to Midway,

13:51.865 --> 13:54.132
but for taking me
around the world.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.633
He's so talented.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.737
Alex.

13:59.773 --> 14:00.605
Hi.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.006
Something wrong
with your breakfast,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.242
or do you always eavesdrop?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.611
As a writer,
I'm a trained listener.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.112
It's a...
It's a skill.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.314
Really?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.950
Yet you lack the ability
to read a room.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.852
Well, truth is,
I couldn't help but overhear

14:13.887 --> 14:16.120
your passionate praise
for Sterling Masters.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.123
"Talented"
is a bit of a stretch.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.126
He stands in front of a camera
and reads a TelePrompTer.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.461
I mean, the show's great,

14:23.496 --> 14:26.297
but his writing
made me a true fan.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.132
How so?

14:28.168 --> 14:29.834
He puts his heart and soul
into words.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.970
It's like I really know him.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.539
Well, sometimes,
the person you see on TV

14:34.574 --> 14:37.242
is not always the same
in real life.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.278
Oh, I understand now.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.646
Understand what?

14:41.681 --> 14:42.981
You're jealous.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.016
- Jealous?
- Well, yeah.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.720
Sterling is an accomplished,
best-selling writer.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.389
Just because someone
is more successful

14:51.424 --> 14:52.957
doesn't make it okay
to put 'em down.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.359
Uh, now, Aria,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.494
let's not go insulting
the few guests we have.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.030
Sorry. It's early.
She hasn't had her coffee yet.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.199
Read Sterling's
Big Holiday Adventure.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.700
Maybe it'll give you
some inspiration.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.237
Sorry!

15:06.273 --> 15:08.139
Yeah, maybe I will.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.152
Everything good over here?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.325
Welcome to the Mistletoe Diner.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.993
Oh. You.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.095
Can I get you
a cup of coffee?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.197
I would love some.
Thank you.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.299
Shouldn't you be writing?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.668
Well, I heard Santa
was gonna make an appearance.

15:36.703 --> 15:37.902
Uh, can't miss that.

15:37.938 --> 15:38.937
Could be inspiring.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.272
Santa? For a mystery novel?

15:41.308 --> 15:44.242
Well, I always need
a good red herring.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.010
What's the name
of your book again?

15:46.046 --> 15:49.347
The book is called
<i>The... Mistletoe Mystery.</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:51.015
Huh.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.483
I'll get that coffee.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.220
"Mistletoe Mystery." Nice.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.258
Ho, ho, ho.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.226
There's no frowning
at Christmas.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.595
I'm sorry, Santa, you weren't
supposed to see that.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.431
There you go.
Santa sees everything.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.034
But, lucky for you...

16:12.138 --> 16:15.239
I'm just Santa's helper.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.274
And I need a break.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.276
I don't know how to pronounce
half the things

16:18.311 --> 16:19.777
those kids are asking for.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.380
You know, back in my day,

16:22.415 --> 16:24.048
all I wanted
was a bb-gun and a bike.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.718
Well, I think that's why
Santa hires helpers.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.752
Yeah.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.220
So are you new in town?

16:29.255 --> 16:30.521
Just visiting.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.291
Well, there's no better place
to be on Christmas than Midway.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.292
Oh!

16:34.327 --> 16:36.728
I have a job to do.
Hang on there, young man.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.730
Um...

16:41.134 --> 16:42.033
This...

16:42.068 --> 16:45.436
is your official
Midway Christmas passport,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.271
and there is a stamp...

16:47.307 --> 16:48.973
for every event.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.576
There you go.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.012
Is this is a Midway
or Mistletoe Diner tradition?

16:54.047 --> 16:56.280
Well, actually,
it's a little bit of both.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.584
You see, my wife created
the Christmas Council.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.587
They're the people that plan
for this event all year long.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.855
Well, it was her dream

17:03.890 --> 17:06.124
that everybody should have
a place where

17:06.159 --> 17:07.992
they feel they're going home
for the holidays.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.493
Just like us.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.694
That's nice.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.696
Where is Mrs. Claus?
Is she here?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.333
Ah, well, I lost her
a couple years ago.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.101
I'm so sorry.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.803
Yeah.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.471
But, you know,

17:20.507 --> 17:23.107
celebrating Christmas
is just like celebrating her.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.642
She named this
"the Mistletoe Diner"

17:24.676 --> 17:26.778
when we bought it years ago.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.213
And she said
that it was for me,

17:29.249 --> 17:30.715
but I had a sneaky feeling

17:30.750 --> 17:33.651
that she just wanted Christmas
all year round.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.553
Right.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.155
Santa, you're still on duty.

17:37.190 --> 17:41.125
I am stamping passports,
honey, stamping passports.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.827
You two related?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.996
Yeah, I'm Mack Eubanks
and this is my daughter.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.230
Alex Bartlett.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.999
So you two know each other?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.502
She was kind enough
to stay open late

17:51.538 --> 17:52.570
to feed a weary traveler.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.705
After I helped her decorate.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.107
You really are
a fiction writer.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.309
He startled me,

17:58.344 --> 18:00.878
when he snuck in
after hours for pie.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.015
Question, is it strange
to order pie for breakfast?

18:04.050 --> 18:05.683
Absolutely not!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.919
My new friend here
will have a big slice

18:07.954 --> 18:12.423
of your Nutcracker
Honey-Pecan Pie, please.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.058
All right.
Coming right up.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.328
I don't think
she likes me, Santa.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.098
Oh... she's just
a little stressed, that's all.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.166
You see,
there's this travel expert

18:22.202 --> 18:25.036
that's gonna come and cover
some of the events

18:25.071 --> 18:25.970
here in Midway.

18:26.005 --> 18:29.173
Do you know a man
named Sterling Masters?

18:30.543 --> 18:31.876
Vaguely.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.578
Oh, please do not tell her.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.413
She'll be on you
like ticks on a dog.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.848
We're just hoping

18:36.883 --> 18:39.450
that he can put us back
on the map a little bit,

18:39.486 --> 18:41.252
you know,
bring in some tourists.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.055
Oh. Is business down?

18:44.090 --> 18:46.357
We have seen better days.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.359
But she's doing
everything she can.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.595
Oh! Say.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.462
You should come

18:51.498 --> 18:53.598
to the tree-lighting
ceremony tonight.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.601
You'll see her in her element,
and she is goo-ood.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.136
Well, I can't say no to Santa.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.104
Plus, I gotta
fill this passport.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.239
Absolutely.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.441
And I...

19:03.476 --> 19:04.976
gotta get back to work.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.444
Good luck.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.179
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

19:17.891 --> 19:18.856
All right.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.324
There we go.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.559
Thank you.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.861
Hi, Leslie.

19:23.897 --> 19:24.962
Hi, Alex.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.364
Miss Aria Eubanks,

19:26.399 --> 19:28.766
I believe
I'm in need...

19:28.801 --> 19:30.001
of a stamp.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.370
You know
that this is only good

19:32.405 --> 19:34.839
for Midway
Christmas attractions, right?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.207
So I've heard.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.676
So far, very impressed.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.112
Well, we're just tryin'
to keep up with the big cities.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.513
Aria?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.681
Stick around.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.283
The magic
is just getting started.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.985
You ready?

19:48.021 --> 19:49.220
Absolutely.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.989
You know, I was the understudy
for the lead in <i> Cabaret.</i>

19:52.025 --> 19:52.990
Right!

19:56.763 --> 19:59.363
Seasons greetings, Midway!

20:01.734 --> 20:04.802
Tonight, we gather

20:04.837 --> 20:07.738
under a blanket
of twinkling stars,

20:07.774 --> 20:10.708
in front
of an elegant evergreen,

20:10.743 --> 20:14.645
celebrating
the wonder of Christmas...

20:20.220 --> 20:22.486
Um...

20:22.522 --> 20:24.722
in... in Midway.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.658
It's a good thing

20:27.694 --> 20:28.726
that we are here

20:28.761 --> 20:31.729
at this spectacular <i> tannin.</i>

20:31.764 --> 20:33.197
Let's remember

20:33.233 --> 20:35.399
that the real gift

20:35.435 --> 20:36.667
is the joy we have

20:36.703 --> 20:39.003
coming together
and celebrating

20:39.038 --> 20:40.671
the holiday season.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.739
Here, in Midway,

20:41.774 --> 20:44.542
we not only
cherish Christmas,

20:44.577 --> 20:49.347
we embody the values, goodwill,
and heart of the holiday season.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.049
Tonight's tree lighting

20:52.085 --> 20:55.653
is an illumination
of all the love in our lives.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.890
May this year's
Midway festivities

20:59.926 --> 21:01.726
bring you cheer

21:01.761 --> 21:04.428
and create memories
that last a lifetime.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.030
Yes!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.703
Okay! Three...

21:12.739 --> 21:13.904
Two...

21:13.940 --> 21:15.439
One!

21:26.619 --> 21:28.686
Merry Christmas!

21:33.626 --> 21:35.926
Nothing does more for your ego,
Craig, than learning how to--

21:35.962 --> 21:38.629
Oh, fancy seeing you here.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.333
Look. Got my "Yule Log" stamp.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.568
And I met the lone man
of the Christmas Council.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.305
He showed us how to roast
the perfect marshmallow.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.240
- Online.
- Oh!

21:49.275 --> 21:50.474
Would you like me to show you?

21:50.510 --> 21:51.509
Let's see.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.110
Craig? A stick, please.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.679
Thank you, Craig.

21:54.714 --> 21:55.980
Okay.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.415
Pick your marshmallow.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.382
Mm-hmm.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.752
Now, the trick is...

22:01.788 --> 22:04.455
to find the embers,
not the open flame,

22:04.490 --> 22:05.790
and you twist.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.425
Slowly, evenly,

22:07.460 --> 22:09.727
roasting all sides.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.767
Oh, you're a real pro at this.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.503
So, uh, how many of these
did you burn

22:19.539 --> 22:20.771
before you got it?

22:20.807 --> 22:23.307
How many we burn, Craig?

22:23.343 --> 22:24.842
An entire bag.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.279
Ah.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.848
How do you think Midway
compares to San Francisco?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.616
Well, I'll say this.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.286
I know more about Craig
than I do my own neighbors.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.721
You don't know
your neighbors?

22:36.756 --> 22:39.357
We share a wall, not details.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.726
We're done.
Pull 'em up!

22:41.761 --> 22:43.160
- Perfect.
- Pretty good.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.895
You wanna polish
these gourmet marshmallows off

22:44.931 --> 22:46.997
while we go look at
your beautiful tree?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.667
Yeah. All right.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.102
Stay warm, Craig.

22:54.340 --> 22:58.442
So... do you consider
tonight's event a success?

22:59.545 --> 23:00.978
People are happy,

23:01.013 --> 23:02.646
no blown fuses,

23:02.682 --> 23:05.549
and an out-of-towner
made new friends.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.719
I'd say
an overwhelming success.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.656
I just hope...

23:12.692 --> 23:13.691
Hope what?

23:13.726 --> 23:16.994
...Hope everyone captures
the Christmas spirit.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.363
Well, I think your speech
definitely set the mood.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.869
Can you believe that
this is my first break tonight?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.004
Maybe you should
treat yourself more often.

23:27.039 --> 23:27.905
Like you?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.674
How much writing
have you've gotten done

23:30.710 --> 23:32.042
since arriving?

23:32.078 --> 23:35.379
Hey, life's about balance.

23:35.415 --> 23:36.714
Besides, I'm researching.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.250
Researching? Right.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.419
How does
a Christmas tree lighting

23:41.454 --> 23:43.854
fit into a mystery story?

23:45.324 --> 23:47.024
You really want to know?

23:47.059 --> 23:49.193
Yeah.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.328
Okay.

23:53.065 --> 23:56.967
A jewel thief flees
to a small town after...

23:57.003 --> 24:00.104
stealing the legendary
Christmas Diamond.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.773
Our hero
has to track him down,

24:02.809 --> 24:05.142
but doesn't realize that...

24:05.178 --> 24:06.644
the thief has
hidden the diamond

24:06.679 --> 24:09.246
inside of
the town's Christmas tree.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.815
Oh.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.817
Quite the imagination.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.452
I'd like to read
this story.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.653
Yeah, maybe someday.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.821
Want some hot chocolate?

24:16.856 --> 24:18.489
- Sure.
- Okay, good.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.224
People reading
my passion projects

24:20.259 --> 24:22.293
also makes me
wildly uncomfortable.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.427
Two hot chocolates, please.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.962
Isn't that why you write?

24:24.997 --> 24:26.230
To share your dream?

24:28.768 --> 24:30.167
Yeah.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.435
Yeah, I guess you're right.

24:32.605 --> 24:33.838
What about you?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.473
Are you sharing your dream?

24:35.508 --> 24:37.141
Think so.
I'm in the process

24:37.176 --> 24:39.743
of making Midway a premiere
Christmas destination.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.812
Well, I think tonight's crowd
would agree.

24:41.848 --> 24:44.415
Good times all around.

24:44.450 --> 24:48.586
Yeah, sometimes, it's hard
to let go and enjoy it.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.122
You know, it's like
a never-ending to-do list.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.492
A lot of people depend on me.

24:54.527 --> 24:55.493
Hmm.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.027
Thank you.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.196
Why don't you ask for help?

24:59.232 --> 25:00.965
Oh, not in my nature.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.502
I hated doing
group projects in school.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.471
Always ended up having to do
all the work by myself.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.174
And let the popular kid
get all the credit.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.709
Yeah.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.478
Not sure I'm such a fan
of group work myself.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.447
Well, hello, you two.
Are you having fun?

25:16.482 --> 25:17.615
Yeah.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.550
I didn't interrupt
anything, did I?

25:19.585 --> 25:20.951
No! Not at all.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.787
Actually, you know what?
I better get going.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.957
This was really great.
Thank you.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.492
Um, makes me
want to get a Christmas tree.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.227
Th-- Oh, really?

25:30.263 --> 25:31.862
Well, that's a coincidence.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.364
Because Aria's gonna go get
a tree for herself tomorrow,

25:33.399 --> 25:34.398
aren't ya, honey?

25:34.433 --> 25:36.500
Well, you're coming with me.

25:36.536 --> 25:40.237
Well, there's the thing, honey,
I can't, my back is killing me.

25:40.273 --> 25:42.907
Alex, maybe--
Maybe you could go with her.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.174
She's gonna need some help.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.175
Yeah, sure.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.644
I mean, I don't want
to impose on tradition.

25:46.679 --> 25:47.511
Oh, no, no, no. No.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.913
Don't worry about that.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.648
You would be
doing me a big favor.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.549
Dad.

25:51.584 --> 25:52.816
Honey, it's a workout

25:52.852 --> 25:54.685
and I can help you
decorate later.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.687
Wait, workout?

25:56.722 --> 25:57.821
But you don't need
to worry about that

25:57.857 --> 25:59.323
because she is
deceptively strong.

26:00.493 --> 26:03.394
Yeah, sure, of course.
I'll pick you up at the diner.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.262
- 10:00 a.m.?
- 10:00 a.m.?

26:05.298 --> 26:07.665
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, 10:00 a.m.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.999
Good seeing you again.
Bye, Mack.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.000
Yeah! Bye!

26:11.304 --> 26:12.703
Meddling.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.171
You can't help yourself.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.874
My back is sore.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.676
One of those little kids
I picked up today

26:18.711 --> 26:20.010
must've weighed
a hundred pounds.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.345
Mm-hmm.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.848
I like that young man, honey.

26:26.152 --> 26:30.054
I think he's got the makings
of a true Mistletoe Man.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.422
Are you kidding?

26:31.457 --> 26:34.425
You barely even know him.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.761
Well, it takes one
to know one.

26:37.797 --> 26:41.031
Now, I definitely think
that boy

26:41.067 --> 26:44.201
would climb
the highest mountain,

26:44.236 --> 26:45.703
he would find
the tallest oak tree,

26:45.738 --> 26:47.571
to gather mistletoe
for his true love.

26:47.607 --> 26:48.973
The Mistletoe Man

26:49.008 --> 26:52.309
is not about
completing physical challenges.

26:52.345 --> 26:54.912
He's generous, caring,

26:54.947 --> 26:57.047
and open-minded.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.416
And believe me,
that is not Alex.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.251
He is judgmental,

27:01.287 --> 27:02.586
opinionated.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.221
Worst of all,

27:04.256 --> 27:05.756
he thinks that Sterling Masters

27:05.791 --> 27:08.492
is just
some smiling TV personality.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.462
Well, consider it
a gut instinct.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.163
Why?
'Cause he bought you pie?

27:13.199 --> 27:14.331
No.

27:14.367 --> 27:15.933
Although the pie helped.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.545
I know this is a bad time,

27:28.581 --> 27:31.415
but I left
my flannel shirt at home.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.717
Are we really gonna
cut this thing down ourselves?

27:33.753 --> 27:36.887
Yeah! That's the fun part.
You gotta earn it.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.155
Do we, though?

27:38.190 --> 27:39.790
Mm-hmm.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.661
Oh.

27:43.696 --> 27:46.063
So, what's your story?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.966
Small-town girl,
loving family,

27:49.001 --> 27:51.068
owns the local diner.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.003
I feel like there's more
you're leaving out.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.139
What do you want to know?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.474
Well, did you always want
to take over the diner?

27:57.510 --> 27:59.410
Well, Mom believed

27:59.445 --> 28:02.012
that everyone should have
a home for the holidays.

28:02.048 --> 28:05.315
And, well...

28:05.351 --> 28:07.751
Midway's my home,
I love it.

28:07.787 --> 28:10.120
She taught me

28:10.156 --> 28:12.456
that home is more of a feeling
than a place,

28:12.491 --> 28:16.126
and that's why we moved
from North Carolina to Utah.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.128
Well, Midway
is a pretty special town.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.532
I think we might have a winner.

28:21.567 --> 28:22.833
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

28:24.336 --> 28:26.370
Good story, or what?

28:26.405 --> 28:27.871
- Good story.
- All right.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.606
Are you sure you don't
want to get

28:29.642 --> 28:31.208
one of these Paul Bunyans
over there to do this?

28:31.243 --> 28:33.777
This city guy has
no experience with a saw.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.279
Well, first time
for everything.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.346
You take that end,

28:36.382 --> 28:38.716
I'll take this one.

28:38.751 --> 28:39.583
Where did you grow up?

28:39.618 --> 28:42.052
All over.
I was a military brat.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.253
Really?

28:43.289 --> 28:46.890
But I guess where I spent
the most time was Jacksonville.

28:46.926 --> 28:47.958
Uh-huh?

28:47.993 --> 28:48.892
When I was kid,

28:48.928 --> 28:51.195
my dream was to see
the Northern Lights.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.297
I thought
that's where Santa lived.

28:53.332 --> 28:56.033
My dad was in the Navy,
so he traveled everywhere,

28:56.068 --> 28:57.735
and he promised me
that one day

28:57.770 --> 29:00.504
we would spend Christmas
in Alaska.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.673
Oh. Did you?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.341
Nope. Moved to Florida.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.843
My dream kind of died.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.211
Aw.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.912
I read some books about it.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.914
The magic was a little bit lost.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.683
You should still go.

29:12.718 --> 29:13.851
I don't need to find Santa.

29:13.886 --> 29:14.718
Maybe not,

29:14.754 --> 29:16.854
but maybe
you'll find a little magic.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.990
Oh, yeah. Maybe.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.492
Okay, now, this,
this is too much.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.926
This is overkill.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.661
We should get up here
and get a picture.

29:24.697 --> 29:26.530
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah, let's do it.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.867
'Cause your city friends
will never believe it.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.401
They really won't.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.737
Ooh, hoo. Oh, yes, please.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.006
Do you mind?
Oh, thank you so much.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.241
All right.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.743
Say "Christmas tree."

29:42.381 --> 29:43.347
All right, well,

29:43.382 --> 29:45.883
you have earned this flannel,
Mr. Paul Bunyan.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.451
Thank you.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.887
Look at us.
Successful group project.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.121
I know.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.456
You, uh, you should
take that tree back

29:52.491 --> 29:53.857
and put it in your room.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.292
- Really?
- Yeah!

29:55.327 --> 29:56.560
I'd need to decorate it.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.594
Mm.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.363
Think I should petition
the Christmas Council

29:59.398 --> 30:00.731
for a little help.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.199
No petition needed.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.134
Request granted.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.103
All right.
Let's hit it.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.538
Mm!

30:18.484 --> 30:19.950
Thank you very much.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.552
I feel like a man now.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.253
Um... perfect!

30:23.289 --> 30:25.322
I can get my passport stamped.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.790
Oh!

30:26.826 --> 30:30.327
You are, uh,
stepping up your game.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.562
- I like a challenge.
- Mm.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.963
Oh!

30:32.998 --> 30:34.464
Hey! I've always wanted
one of these.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.401
And here I thought
you were a real contender.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.769
What do you mean?

30:38.804 --> 30:40.971
You know, "the Ugly
Christmas Sweater" stamp,

30:41.006 --> 30:42.272
it can't just be bought,

30:42.308 --> 30:43.807
you gotta earn it, too.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.342
What, knowing
the Christmas Council President

30:45.377 --> 30:46.844
doesn't get me any favors?

30:46.879 --> 30:48.245
How'd you know
I was president?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.246
I pay attention.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.914
Mm.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.250
This one speaks to me
as a person.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.751
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.253
Well, it brings out your eyes.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.354
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.522
But you should know

30:58.557 --> 30:59.857
that the Mistletoe Diner

30:59.892 --> 31:01.525
Ugly Christmas Sweater-
making party

31:01.560 --> 31:02.926
is an honored tradition

31:02.962 --> 31:04.928
and I expect to see you there.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.530
Oh, I'll be there.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.298
With bells on.
And tinsel.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.299
Garland?

31:09.335 --> 31:11.501
No. No garland.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.342
Okay.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.514
It's fine.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.284
"Write from your heart."

31:28.554 --> 31:31.121
Make it good.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.163
No, let's make it great.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.174
- Hi.
- Hey!

31:52.878 --> 31:54.411
This...

31:54.446 --> 31:56.313
is a step up from wine.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.283
That is the official
Mistletoe Martini.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.352
This whole thing
is a serious step up.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.654
I may be in over my head.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.489
Go find a table.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.657
I'll send an expert
over to help.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.458
Yes, ma'am.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.734
Okay.

32:21.774 --> 32:22.940
I could have
helped you with that.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.241
No worries.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.043
I guessed
green was your color.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.377
How did you know?

32:27.413 --> 32:28.845
Look at this beautiful thing.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.951
So what do we do, we just, uh,
glue things to it?

32:33.986 --> 32:36.253
Don't forget your Bedazzler!

32:36.288 --> 32:38.755
I want to see you sparkle.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.023
Make it good.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.224
We're judging
for the contest later.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.795
Oh, I'm gonna shine so bright,
Rudolph is gonna go blind.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.931
Pow!

32:47.967 --> 32:50.200
Sorry, I really
want this victory.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.603
What's gotten into you?

32:53.639 --> 32:56.039
Are you always
this excited to Bedazzle?

32:56.075 --> 32:57.708
Well, not that
you'd be interested,

32:57.743 --> 32:59.476
but my Christmas wish came true.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.212
Sterling Masters
is in town.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.747
Really? In Midway?

33:03.782 --> 33:06.450
Midway was selected for
his "Big Holiday Adventure."

33:06.485 --> 33:09.219
He just published about it
a little while ago.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.288
I got an alert.
Check this out.

33:11.323 --> 33:16.226
"This picturesque mountain town
offers more than holiday spirit.

33:16.261 --> 33:19.830
In Midway,
Christmas is a tangible force.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.966
From its sugar cookies
to live evergreen forests,

33:23.002 --> 33:25.502
it feels like
every corner offers

33:25.537 --> 33:27.804
a piece of magic
you can carry with you."

33:27.840 --> 33:29.239
Oh!

33:29.274 --> 33:31.074
Live evergreens!

33:31.110 --> 33:33.443
He could've been cutting a tree
right next to us,

33:33.479 --> 33:34.244
and we didn't even know it.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.747
He must be good
at blending in.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.782
I mean, word travels fast
in this town

33:38.817 --> 33:42.452
and nobody's mentioned anything
about a Sterling sighting.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.122
You've seen him, haven't you?

33:45.157 --> 33:46.990
No. What?

33:47.026 --> 33:48.825
I barely know
what he looks like.

33:48.861 --> 33:49.793
I doubt it.

33:49.828 --> 33:52.996
You live in San Francisco,
not under a rock.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.133
All right, pass the Bedazzler.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.268
I'm gonna win this thing.

33:59.405 --> 34:00.437
Good luck!

34:00.472 --> 34:01.438
- Thank you.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.010
So how long
does it take to dry?

34:07.046 --> 34:09.279
Oh, just a bit.

34:09.313 --> 34:12.449
Okay.
Wow, your tree is beautiful.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.185
Well, I still need
to add ornaments.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.853
- Let's do it.
- Right now?

34:16.889 --> 34:18.054
What else are we gonna do?

34:18.090 --> 34:19.656
Well, the judging's
gonna start.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.824
We're on a schedule.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.826
Perfect. We'll get extra points
for decorating the tree.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.527
Come on!

34:26.498 --> 34:28.465
Okay.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.668
These are from Berlin.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.237
How'd you know?

34:34.273 --> 34:35.739
Lucky guess.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.841
I thought the Rockefeller tree
was nice,

34:37.876 --> 34:40.010
but this guy...
stunning.

34:40.045 --> 34:42.212
Mm.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.514
You been to the Big Apple
for Christmas?

34:44.550 --> 34:46.183
Yeah.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.217
Wasn't a great experience.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.719
No offense
to the Rockefeller tree.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.322
You weren't mugged,
were you?

34:52.357 --> 34:54.491
I'm sorry if you were.
It's much safer now.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.993
Aww, it was more like
a ruined Christmas.

34:57.029 --> 34:59.496
What kind of a monster
ruins Christmas in New York?

34:59.531 --> 35:00.897
My ex.

35:00.933 --> 35:03.166
I thought
he was the Mistle... uh.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.768
Ahem.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.503
Mis... What?

35:06.538 --> 35:08.238
Uh, Mr. Perfect.

35:08.273 --> 35:11.675
That we wanted the same things,
but he didn't.

35:11.710 --> 35:15.378
His dreams were
living in Manhattan,

35:15.414 --> 35:17.881
Broadway shows,
high-rise apartments,

35:17.916 --> 35:19.583
24-hour diners.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.052
You didn't want that?

35:22.087 --> 35:23.753
Well, my heart's in Midway.

35:23.789 --> 35:24.855
This is my home.

35:26.592 --> 35:29.025
Well, home is a feeling,
not a place, right?

35:29.061 --> 35:30.994
Sometimes,
they're one and the same.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.398
Looking for Sterling?

35:35.434 --> 35:37.234
M... Maybe.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.869
Hey, everyone!

35:38.904 --> 35:43.607
Time for the judging
of the sweaters!

35:53.485 --> 35:56.720
Oh! Don't you two
look adorable?

35:56.755 --> 35:58.221
Picture-perfect.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.956
I love all the sparkles.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.258
We aim to please.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.826
What do you say, folks,

36:02.861 --> 36:05.128
could these two win
for best ugliest sweaters?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.932
Aw, thank you.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.167
- Congratulations.

36:10.202 --> 36:14.437
Well, congrats on your pretty
ugly Christmas sweater win.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.072
It's a big bucket-list
moment for me.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.943
But where am I gonna get
to wear this exquisite fashion?

36:19.978 --> 36:21.745
Well, wear it to the Christmas
market on Saturday.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.914
Little booths. Crafts.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.916
Food.
I'll be selling pies.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.718
Afterwards,
there's dancing at the pavilion.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.356
What I mean is,

36:33.392 --> 36:34.758
you know, the whole town
will be there.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.026
And with any luck,

36:36.061 --> 36:38.461
Sterling Masters
will pay a visit.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.865
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Maybe.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.633
Hey, save me some sparkle!

36:43.669 --> 36:44.901
I'm sorry I'm late, I--

36:44.937 --> 36:48.004
Well, gee whiz, I wasn't gonna
win this thing after all, was I?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.306
It was fun.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.607
I should probably get
some more pies.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.641
Okay.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.415
All right.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.829
Hey, Leslie, what's with
the, uh, what's with the crowd?

37:12.864 --> 37:14.664
Sterling Masters.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.900
He posted his first article
on Midway today

37:16.935 --> 37:19.069
and a charter bus arrived
from the ski resort.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.170
Can you believe it?

37:29.014 --> 37:30.513
Finally!

37:30.549 --> 37:32.515
You can be a ghost to Midway,
but not to me.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.150
So you liked the article?

37:34.186 --> 37:35.585
<i>Like it? I love it!</i>

37:35.621 --> 37:36.886
"The citizens of Midway

37:36.922 --> 37:38.822
offer an unbridled
Christmas spirit

37:38.857 --> 37:41.057
that can sweeten
even the most bitter hearts.

37:41.093 --> 37:44.160
<i>Midway has managed
to manifest the Capra Christmas</i>

37:44.196 --> 37:45.495
<i>into reality,</i>

37:45.530 --> 37:48.198
<i>where 'peace on Earth,
and goodwill towards all men'</i>

37:48.233 --> 37:51.401
<i>is not just an idea,
but a way of life."</i>

37:51.436 --> 37:53.336
Ha! Are you serious?

37:53.372 --> 37:56.406
Midway sounds
like a holiday utopia.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.875
Yeah, it's got its, uh...
its perks.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.011
Love the adventure
to get a Christmas tree.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.078
What are you
gonna write about next?

38:02.114 --> 38:05.048
Uh, well, there's
a Christmas market on Saturday.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.450
<i>A market?
Like traders and tents?</i>

38:07.486 --> 38:09.586
No, more like a...
Not so primitive.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.954
Like a Christmas festival.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.722
<i>Great!</i>

38:12.758 --> 38:15.025
<i>That'll be perfect
for my book signing.</i>

38:15.060 --> 38:17.027
Sorry, what,
your book signing?

38:17.062 --> 38:19.296
Yeah, a compilation
of my articles from the website.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.930
My articles.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.932
W-Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

38:22.968 --> 38:24.768
<i>Our</i> articles.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.136
You know how crazy

38:26.171 --> 38:27.537
<i>this business is.</i>

38:27.572 --> 38:28.672
<i>An idea pops up,</i>

38:28.707 --> 38:30.573
<i>you don't think
it's gonna go anywhere...</i>

38:30.609 --> 38:32.609
Bam! You have a book published.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.677
This will be great
for both of us.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.645
<i>I'll tell you
more about it tomorrow.</i>

38:35.681 --> 38:37.380
Tomorrow?

38:37.416 --> 38:38.782
You're coming to Midway?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.050
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

38:40.085 --> 38:42.452
<i>Don't worry, my assistant
will set everything up.</i>

38:42.487 --> 38:43.920
<i>Now that the article's out,</i>

38:43.955 --> 38:45.055
I can be seen.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.156
See you tomorrow.

38:46.191 --> 38:47.624
Yeah.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.710
Oh, absolutely.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.946
- Say "Christmas"!
- Christmas!

39:11.950 --> 39:14.951
It's so nice
to meet my fans.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.986
Alex! Hey!

39:20.492 --> 39:21.691
We don't know each other.

39:21.727 --> 39:22.826
Right.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.365
Ahem.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.469
I'm Sterling.
How are you?

39:32.504 --> 39:34.237
Good.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.406
So tell me
about the book.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.974
My look? I'm going for
"casual mountain man."

39:38.009 --> 39:39.409
How do you like the flannel?

39:39.444 --> 39:42.278
My stylist says
it's "the fabric of America."

39:42.314 --> 39:44.080
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

39:44.116 --> 39:46.082
The book.
Our book.

39:46.118 --> 39:46.950
Oh, yeah.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.085
It's a sweet deal.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.621
Consider it
an early Christmas present.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.156
Hello, young man.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.924
Hey, Mack.
How you doing?

39:54.960 --> 39:55.959
I'm fine. Hey.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.162
I hear the Christmas tree hunt
went rather well.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.663
Yeah, yeah. It...

40:00.699 --> 40:03.333
Hey, Mack, do you have
the sports section?

40:03.368 --> 40:05.135
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
There you go.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.336
Thank you, my friend.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.172
Sterling Masters.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.175
It's really you!
In my diner!

40:12.210 --> 40:13.109
I knew in my heart
you'd show up.

40:13.145 --> 40:14.177
I'm Aria Eubanks.

40:14.212 --> 40:17.480
I submitted Midway
for the Big Holiday Adventure.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.948
Oh, yes, Aria.
So nice to meet you.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.316
This is my dad.

40:20.352 --> 40:23.686
Mack.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.522
My daughter

40:25.557 --> 40:27.257
is your biggest fan.
Your biggest fan!

40:27.292 --> 40:28.958
I've read
all of your articles.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.027
I feel like I've traveled
the world with you.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.162
Thank you, thank you

40:32.197 --> 40:33.263
for being here,
your writing,

40:33.298 --> 40:34.931
just for everything.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.167
I wish I was as good with words
as you are.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.501
Well, that's my job.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.437
To take folks
off the beaten path

40:40.472 --> 40:43.973
for extraordinary adventures
in unique locations.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.141
Like Midway.

40:46.178 --> 40:47.310
Alex!

40:47.345 --> 40:48.511
This is Sterling Masters.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.113
Alex is a writer, too.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.881
Nice to meet a fellow scribe.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.450
Alex is here
working on his novel.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.717
Is that so?

40:54.753 --> 40:55.652
Yeah.

40:55.687 --> 40:56.820
You know,

40:56.855 --> 40:57.754
I'm promoting my new book

40:57.789 --> 40:59.456
at the Christmas market
this afternoon.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.890
Seriously?

41:00.926 --> 41:03.726
We've never had
a celebrity book signing!

41:03.762 --> 41:05.328
I've just found
the people of Midway

41:05.363 --> 41:06.896
to be so kind and generous.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.566
I thought,
what a perfect place

41:09.601 --> 41:10.667
to announce my next venture.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.169
Shine a real spotlight
on this special little town.

41:13.205 --> 41:14.537
That is so sweet.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.906
Alex, can you believe it?

41:16.942 --> 41:18.141
Not a word.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.709
Since you brought me
here, Aria,

41:19.744 --> 41:22.312
I would like you to be
my VIP at the book signing.

41:22.347 --> 41:23.313
Get to know each other better.

41:23.348 --> 41:24.747
She'll be busy.

41:24.783 --> 41:27.584
She will be selling
her delicious pies.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.519
Not all day.
I would be honored.

41:31.523 --> 41:32.922
Since you and Alex
are both writers,

41:32.958 --> 41:34.591
maybe you can
give Alex some tips.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.859
That's not necessary.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.260
I would love to.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.195
We can hang out at the market.
Talk shop.

41:39.231 --> 41:41.164
Great.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.799
Yeah.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.537
I'm so glad
we can speak freely.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.572
It felt like we were spies
on a secret mission.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.707
Do you think
I'd make a good spy?

41:50.742 --> 41:52.375
No. About that book deal...

41:52.410 --> 41:53.710
Hi. Can I have a stamp, please?

41:53.745 --> 41:55.211
You got the contract, right?

41:55.247 --> 41:56.846
Pretty sweet payday.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.181
Please.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.283
Thank you.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.685
Yes, it's a sweet payday.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.921
Listen, I'm thinking about
taking a break.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.190
Break?
Like Christmas break?

42:07.225 --> 42:09.425
No, not Christmas break.

42:09.461 --> 42:11.294
More like time off
to write my novel.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.863
Whoa, you're actually
writing a novel?

42:13.899 --> 42:16.633
I've told you this
for so very many years.

42:16.668 --> 42:20.270
I mean, everyone says that,
but no one actually does it.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.638
Well, I'm doing it.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.406
Just because
I lost my book deal

42:23.441 --> 42:25.408
doesn't mean
I stopped writing the thing.

42:25.443 --> 42:26.576
You just never talked about it.

42:26.611 --> 42:29.145
Yeah, because I'm too busy
writing as Sterling Masters.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.113
Listen, I love you, man,

42:30.148 --> 42:31.180
but I think

42:31.216 --> 42:33.082
now is the right time
for me to take a step back

42:33.118 --> 42:33.983
and start writing for myself...

42:34.019 --> 42:35.285
full-time.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.119
You can't do that now.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.787
The book's set
to be a best-seller.

42:37.822 --> 42:39.656
Under your name.
Not mine.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.457
Yeah, but we know the truth.

42:41.493 --> 42:43.593
Huh? We're a team.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.663
Listen.

42:46.698 --> 42:49.632
Sometimes...

42:49.668 --> 42:52.201
you just gotta
do things your own way.

42:53.638 --> 42:55.505
We're partners.

42:55.540 --> 42:57.473
I wouldn't be standing here
without you.

42:57.509 --> 42:59.642
Okay. Well, get me a meeting
with your publisher.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.812
Let's just concentrate
on work for now.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.480
There are still
two more articles to go.

43:04.516 --> 43:06.282
Midway deserves the spotlight.

43:12.624 --> 43:14.424
There you go.

43:15.393 --> 43:16.526
Thank you.

43:16.561 --> 43:17.994
Enjoy the holiday season.

43:18.029 --> 43:20.263
Oh, and check out my website

43:20.298 --> 43:23.099
and make sure to tweet,
snap, share, and 'Gram it.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.634
I love you, Midway.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.104
That went so well.

43:29.874 --> 43:31.174
You enjoyed it.
Come on.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.508
People love your writing.

43:33.745 --> 43:34.811
Hmm? Hmm?

43:34.846 --> 43:36.279
Yeah. Maybe.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.180
So...

43:38.683 --> 43:41.284
Aria... what's her story?

43:42.387 --> 43:43.252
What do you mean?

43:43.288 --> 43:45.288
I mean, you two
seem to know each other.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.323
Well, I mean...

43:47.359 --> 43:48.391
hardly.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.793
Really?
She introduced you to me.

43:50.829 --> 43:53.463
She's just that kind
of a friendly person.

43:53.498 --> 43:55.531
What else do you know
about her?

43:55.567 --> 43:58.001
Well, she's, uh, genuine,
the real deal.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.236
Humble.

44:00.271 --> 44:01.337
Incredibly generous.

44:01.373 --> 44:03.039
And warm,

44:03.074 --> 44:04.474
like sunshine
on a winter's day.

44:04.509 --> 44:05.842
I agree.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.410
She seems really great.

44:07.445 --> 44:10.213
Hey, guys.
Saved you a pie.

44:10.248 --> 44:12.015
- You made this?
- Mm-hmm.

44:12.050 --> 44:13.149
How generous.

44:13.184 --> 44:14.217
I almost lost an arm

44:14.252 --> 44:15.251
wrestling it back
from Catherine.

44:15.286 --> 44:17.487
This is Leslie.
She owns the Sugarplum Lodge.

44:17.522 --> 44:18.554
Thanks to you,

44:18.590 --> 44:20.089
we're booked through New Year's,

44:20.125 --> 44:21.691
but I always keep
the Presidential Suite open

44:21.726 --> 44:22.825
for special guests.

44:22.861 --> 44:23.993
Oh, that sounds great.

44:24.029 --> 44:25.128
Yeah, it does.
It's a shame,

44:25.163 --> 44:27.530
because he's staying in a cabin
way outside of town.

44:27.565 --> 44:28.498
I am?

44:28.533 --> 44:29.666
I am.

44:30.835 --> 44:35.171
So what kind of pie did
Leslie wrestle Catherine for?

44:35.206 --> 44:36.339
Um, actually,

44:36.374 --> 44:38.908
it's the pie that put
the Mistletoe Diner on the map,

44:38.943 --> 44:40.877
Mistletoe Man Meringue.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.845
It's my mother's special recipe.

44:44.482 --> 44:46.215
Smells wonderful...

44:46.251 --> 44:47.717
like Christmas in a box.

44:49.421 --> 44:51.854
You know, as president
of the Christmas Council,

44:51.890 --> 44:53.189
Aria can give you a private tour

44:53.224 --> 44:54.557
of all
the Christmas activities.

44:56.094 --> 44:59.595
Well, I don't want to interrupt
your writing process.

44:59.631 --> 45:00.697
Midway is a small town,

45:00.732 --> 45:01.864
but we still have
our hidden gems.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.899
Right, Aria?

45:04.269 --> 45:05.702
I have no doubt about that.

45:05.737 --> 45:07.637
Well, before
Sterling can go anywhere,

45:07.672 --> 45:09.372
he promised to read
a few chapters of my book.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.207
That is so wonderful.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.710
Well, I'll let you guys
get back to work.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.478
I hope we run
into each other again soon.

45:15.513 --> 45:17.413
Me too.

45:17.449 --> 45:19.449
Um, before we go,
can I just--

45:19.484 --> 45:21.084
- Yeah.
- Okay.

45:24.956 --> 45:27.390
Oh... ho, ho, ho, ho.

45:27.425 --> 45:29.592
This might be my new
Christmas card, profile picture,

45:29.627 --> 45:30.626
and wallpaper.

45:30.662 --> 45:33.062
Bye. Thank you again.

45:34.766 --> 45:35.932
Do you think
I should have--

45:35.967 --> 45:37.800
No, just stay right here.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.438
Hey, Aria.

45:42.474 --> 45:43.906
Hey!

45:43.942 --> 45:45.608
Looks like
you have a mentor.

45:45.643 --> 45:47.009
I wouldn't go that far.

45:47.045 --> 45:48.644
I was wondering, uh,

45:48.680 --> 45:50.213
is that dance
still happening?

45:51.349 --> 45:53.249
Y-Yeah. At the pavilion.

45:53.284 --> 45:55.318
But aren't you working
with Sterling?

45:55.353 --> 45:56.953
No. Not all night.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.488
I'll stop by.

45:58.523 --> 45:59.589
Great. I'll see you there.

45:59.624 --> 46:01.324
Okay. See you there.

46:16.574 --> 46:18.107
This is where
you're staying?

46:18.143 --> 46:19.075
Yeah. So, your assistant

46:19.110 --> 46:21.644
arranged a car
to take you to the airport.

46:21.679 --> 46:24.013
Don't want you to miss
any more production meetings.

46:24.048 --> 46:26.349
This reminds me of Switzerland.

46:26.384 --> 46:27.450
Yeah, it's great.

46:27.485 --> 46:28.451
There's a fireplace,

46:28.486 --> 46:29.952
perfect for you to practice
your Swiss-German

46:29.988 --> 46:30.887
while you wait.

46:30.922 --> 46:32.855
Do you think I should stay?

46:32.891 --> 46:34.457
Hang out more in Midway?

46:34.492 --> 46:36.125
No...

46:36.161 --> 46:37.527
No, you're fine.

46:37.562 --> 46:39.462
You've popped in.
It's great.

46:39.497 --> 46:41.564
Back to business as usual,
all right?

46:41.599 --> 46:43.065
Where are you going?

46:43.101 --> 46:44.734
To write.
I got a deadline.

46:44.769 --> 46:46.335
It was good seeing you, man.

46:46.371 --> 46:48.171
<i>Danke schön,</i>
Merry Christmas, and, uh...

46:48.206 --> 46:51.240
I'll call you
about the publisher meeting.

46:51.276 --> 46:53.009
Okay.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.512
Do you have any rooms
available?

47:08.359 --> 47:09.425
What's melting
your snowflakes?

47:09.460 --> 47:10.593
Nothing.

47:10.628 --> 47:12.662
Come on.
You can't fool me.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.864
You practically
asked Sterling out for me.

47:14.899 --> 47:16.098
Unsolicited, by the way.

47:16.134 --> 47:17.033
I say this with love,

47:17.068 --> 47:18.868
but you'll never find
your Mistletoe Man

47:18.903 --> 47:20.102
sitting on the sidelines.

47:20.138 --> 47:22.171
I appreciate your faith in me.

47:22.207 --> 47:23.239
Hello.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.175
A little Christmas romance
is good for the soul.

47:26.211 --> 47:29.011
Well, my heart doesn't
appreciate the uncertainty.

47:29.047 --> 47:30.246
Come on.

47:30.281 --> 47:32.315
Anything can happen
at Christmas.

47:33.985 --> 47:35.351
Hey, Alex.
You look nice.

47:35.386 --> 47:36.452
Thank you.

47:36.487 --> 47:38.387
How did things go
with Sterling?

47:38.423 --> 47:40.022
Good, yeah, he's reading
the chapters tonight.

47:40.058 --> 47:42.091
Do I get, uh, a stamp?

47:42.126 --> 47:43.125
Of course.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.527
- Thank you very much.

47:44.562 --> 47:47.897
I haven't been to a dance
since prom.

47:47.932 --> 47:51.367
I don't know if this is how
it's still done, but, uh...

47:51.402 --> 47:52.668
may I have this dance?

47:54.739 --> 47:55.671
Don't step on me.

48:04.482 --> 48:06.249
You understand that Midway

48:06.284 --> 48:09.318
truly makes people feel
at home for Christmas,

48:09.354 --> 48:10.553
and that's thanks to you.

48:10.588 --> 48:11.954
And Sterling.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.923
Look at this crowd.

48:13.958 --> 48:16.158
It's double from last year.

48:16.194 --> 48:17.293
And more importantly,

48:17.328 --> 48:19.262
he's helping you
with your novel.

48:19.297 --> 48:21.931
You missed
your Christmas cruise for it.

48:23.268 --> 48:25.801
What's important to you?
What's your Christmas wish?

48:28.306 --> 48:31.307
Christmas is back in Midway.
That's all I wanted.

48:31.342 --> 48:34.010
- Oh, come on,
that can't be all.

48:34.045 --> 48:36.646
You deserve something.
Special.

48:36.681 --> 48:38.447
Just for you.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.654
Because you've been
such a good friend, you know?

48:47.492 --> 48:48.958
At first,

48:48.993 --> 48:51.694
I thought your honesty
was annoying,

48:51.729 --> 48:53.329
but I actually admire it.

48:53.364 --> 48:54.363
Thank you.

48:54.399 --> 48:56.332
Real friends are truthful.

48:59.904 --> 49:02.104
Aria, there's something
I should, uh...

49:02.140 --> 49:03.372
I should tell you.

49:03.408 --> 49:04.440
What?

49:04.475 --> 49:05.608
I am...

49:05.643 --> 49:06.943
Sterling?

49:06.978 --> 49:08.477
What?

49:08.513 --> 49:09.845
How?

49:09.881 --> 49:11.314
Hello again.

49:11.349 --> 49:12.648
What are you doing here?
I thought you were...

49:12.684 --> 49:14.050
Reading your chapters?

49:14.085 --> 49:15.284
Riveting.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.153
I think you have a real future.

49:17.188 --> 49:18.955
My publisher
would be very interested.

49:20.091 --> 49:22.458
I also finished a good portion
of that pie.

49:22.493 --> 49:23.292
Delicious!

49:23.328 --> 49:25.328
I had to come
thank you in person.

49:26.597 --> 49:28.264
You really are like
sunshine on a winter's day.

49:29.534 --> 49:30.967
Greetings!

49:31.002 --> 49:34.303
I'd recognize
that dazzling smile anywhere.

49:34.339 --> 49:36.672
Welcome to Midway,
Sterling Masters.

49:36.708 --> 49:37.707
Thank you.

49:37.742 --> 49:38.741
We're honored to have you.

49:38.776 --> 49:39.875
Oh.

49:39.911 --> 49:41.344
I have a special VIP table.

49:41.379 --> 49:42.511
Please join us.

49:42.547 --> 49:44.680
This is our Christmas Council.

49:44.716 --> 49:45.715
So nice to meet everyone.

49:45.750 --> 49:49.018
I would love to hear more
from the Council, but...

49:49.053 --> 49:50.519
not without its president.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.955
Aria? Lead the way.

49:55.059 --> 49:56.425
Alex, what about you?

49:56.461 --> 49:57.393
Join us?

49:57.428 --> 50:01.263
No, I'm okay.
I'll catch up with you guys.

50:01.299 --> 50:03.499
We were all so impressed

50:03.534 --> 50:05.735
with your exquisite review
of our little town.

50:05.770 --> 50:06.702
You didn't mention

50:06.738 --> 50:09.005
Santa's Scavenger Hunt
or Chestnut Canyon.

50:10.441 --> 50:11.607
What?
I worked hard on the hunt.

50:11.642 --> 50:13.609
Well, it's one of
three articles.

50:13.644 --> 50:15.011
Christmas is still a week away.

50:15.046 --> 50:16.178
Put them on my list.

50:16.214 --> 50:17.346
Anywhere else?

50:17.382 --> 50:20.850
I'll definitely check out
that live Christmas tree farm.

50:20.885 --> 50:24.053
"If Winter Wonderland
were a real place."

50:24.088 --> 50:26.555
Uh, you called it that
in your last article.

50:27.892 --> 50:29.225
Right!

50:29.260 --> 50:30.726
Sorry,
it's been a long day.

50:32.597 --> 50:34.030
Where should I go next?

50:34.065 --> 50:36.799
Mrs. Claus's Tea Room,
the Christmas Cocoa Party...

50:36.834 --> 50:38.534
The holiday hike.

50:38.569 --> 50:39.969
Santa's village.

50:40.004 --> 50:40.903
We take Christmas
seriously here.

50:40.938 --> 50:43.406
Now, I do have a question,
and be honest.

50:43.441 --> 50:44.340
Okay.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.442
I know we don't have
the lavish landmarks

50:46.477 --> 50:48.277
like they do
in the big cities,

50:48.312 --> 50:50.179
but how do you think
we compare so far?

50:51.783 --> 50:54.750
There is no comparison.

50:54.786 --> 50:57.219
That's what's so special
about Christmas.

50:57.255 --> 50:59.555
It makes
every city beautiful.

51:07.098 --> 51:08.764
There you are.
I could have used you in there.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.233
Wingman--
Not in my contract.

51:11.269 --> 51:13.436
Wingman?
I needed a lifeline.

51:13.471 --> 51:15.638
I was bombarded
by the Christmas Council.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.239
Why'd you stay?

51:17.275 --> 51:18.774
Well, the Sugarplum Lodge
offered me

51:18.810 --> 51:19.842
the Presidential Suite.

51:19.877 --> 51:21.277
How could I refuse?

51:21.312 --> 51:23.579
This was not
part of the plan.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.414
We are trying
something different.

51:25.450 --> 51:27.116
It could be fun.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.150
Think positive.

51:28.186 --> 51:29.785
It's Aria, isn't it?

51:31.789 --> 51:33.989
I really feel
a connection with her.

51:34.025 --> 51:35.124
She gets me.

51:35.159 --> 51:36.826
Please.

51:36.861 --> 51:38.027
I'm serious!

51:38.062 --> 51:40.496
She speaks to me
with so much passion.

51:40.531 --> 51:43.532
It's like... my work
really means something to her.

51:43.568 --> 51:45.301
My work.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.469
She watches the show, too.

51:48.005 --> 51:49.638
Help me get to know her better.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.173
What's the big deal?

51:51.209 --> 51:52.241
It feels wrong.

51:52.276 --> 51:54.143
I don't want to lie to her
any more than we have.

51:54.178 --> 51:55.544
The ghostwriter thing?

51:55.580 --> 51:56.612
We won't bring it up.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.216
Look, I'm not asking you
to be a matchmaker.

52:00.251 --> 52:02.017
We'll all hang out around town

52:02.053 --> 52:04.987
and I'll call my publisher
right now.

52:05.022 --> 52:08.157
Well, not right now--
Tomorrow, definitely.

52:08.192 --> 52:09.658
And you can have time off
to finish your book.

52:09.694 --> 52:11.293
I'll even write the foreword.

52:13.264 --> 52:14.497
You write it.
I'll sign it.

52:16.534 --> 52:17.833
Then it's a deal.

52:19.537 --> 52:20.870
This is gonna be great.

52:28.412 --> 52:29.445
Alex!

52:29.480 --> 52:30.980
Holiday cheer.

52:31.015 --> 52:34.083
Welcome to my merrymaking
tea room.

52:34.118 --> 52:35.317
Oh, thank you, Catherine.

52:35.353 --> 52:37.553
Oh, my dear,
you have been confused.

52:37.588 --> 52:39.121
I'm Mrs. Claus.

52:39.157 --> 52:40.422
Right, of course.

52:40.458 --> 52:42.291
My mistake. Mrs. Claus.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.164
Do you sleep ever?

52:49.200 --> 52:51.800
When Mrs. Claus wants pie,
you gotta deliver.

52:51.836 --> 52:52.801
Yeah, you wouldn't

52:52.837 --> 52:54.670
want to end up
on her husband's naughty list.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.906
I didn't picture you
as the tea party type.

52:56.941 --> 52:58.274
This is my first one.

52:58.309 --> 53:00.009
So what do you recommend?

53:00.044 --> 53:02.444
The "holiday blend"
or "candy cane"?

53:02.480 --> 53:03.946
Definitely holiday blend.

53:03.981 --> 53:05.781
Cinnamon
is my all-time favorite.

53:05.816 --> 53:08.417
Goes best
with the Mistletoe Man Meringue.

53:08.452 --> 53:09.451
Okay.

53:09.487 --> 53:11.487
Hey. How great is this?

53:11.522 --> 53:13.689
I love tea.
Where are we sitting?

53:13.724 --> 53:15.257
Um, I wasn't going to stay,
actually.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.592
I have to get back to the diner.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.527
You give yourself
a lunch break, right?

53:18.563 --> 53:20.863
Stay, just one cup.

53:20.898 --> 53:23.299
Okay.
Let me call the diner.

53:25.870 --> 53:27.102
Gentlemen.

53:27.138 --> 53:28.771
What a delight,

53:28.806 --> 53:31.440
to host
such honorable guests.

53:31.475 --> 53:34.944
So, which of the North Pole's
specialty brews

53:34.979 --> 53:37.680
may Mrs. Claus
fetch for this dashing duo?

53:37.715 --> 53:39.782
Hmm.

53:39.817 --> 53:40.983
I do love peppermint.

53:41.018 --> 53:42.151
- Mm.

53:42.186 --> 53:45.354
I'll have two of those,
and Mistletoe pie all around.

53:45.389 --> 53:47.323
You don't think she'll mind
if I order for her, do you?

53:47.358 --> 53:48.290
Alex?

53:50.361 --> 53:53.062
I'll have the holiday blend,
extra cinnamon.

53:53.097 --> 53:54.129
Good choice.

53:54.165 --> 53:56.065
Thank you, Mrs. Claus.

53:56.100 --> 53:58.133
Aw, I really wish
I didn't have to do this,

53:58.169 --> 54:00.302
but who knows what you'd say
if I left you alone.

54:00.338 --> 54:02.338
Relax, it's just tea.

54:03.374 --> 54:04.406
Hi.

54:04.442 --> 54:05.374
I hope you don't mind,

54:05.409 --> 54:07.476
but I took the liberty
of ordering for you.

54:07.511 --> 54:08.877
Oh.

54:08.913 --> 54:10.312
Oh!

54:10.348 --> 54:12.348
I hope these poinsettias
aren't real.

54:12.383 --> 54:13.983
Alex is allergic.

54:14.018 --> 54:15.985
To the sap,
not the flower.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.152
Don't break a leaf,
I'll be fine.

54:17.188 --> 54:18.721
Details.

54:18.756 --> 54:19.888
How did you know
he had an allergy?

54:24.762 --> 54:28.664
A fan gave Sterling one
when we were discussing my book.

54:28.699 --> 54:29.365
Exactly!

54:29.400 --> 54:31.734
Alex gave me
the whole story.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.102
How he almost ended up
at the E.R.

54:33.137 --> 54:35.404
Tea and pie for everybody!

54:35.439 --> 54:36.772
Thank goodness!

54:36.807 --> 54:38.007
Thank you.

54:39.076 --> 54:41.043
There you go, sir.

54:41.078 --> 54:43.212
Ahh.

54:43.247 --> 54:44.747
In Japan,

54:44.782 --> 54:46.882
this is known
as bakha-cha.

54:46.917 --> 54:48.350
In Korea.

54:48.386 --> 54:50.519
It's where I had
my first tea ceremony.

54:50.554 --> 54:52.121
At Christmas,

54:52.156 --> 54:53.956
they host the Boseong
light festival

54:53.991 --> 54:55.858
at the tea plantations.

54:55.893 --> 54:57.226
I'll put it on my bucket list.

55:03.567 --> 55:06.568
Mm, very minty...

55:11.575 --> 55:12.741
Thank you.

55:17.948 --> 55:19.748
Okay, dashers.

55:19.784 --> 55:22.217
The object
of this year's scavenger hunt

55:22.253 --> 55:24.053
is to find all three pieces
of a snowman.

55:24.088 --> 55:26.789
Pieces are hidden
throughout Santa's village

55:26.824 --> 55:28.257
and surrounding areas.

55:28.292 --> 55:31.126
Your clues
are on this piece of paper.

55:31.162 --> 55:32.494
First team

55:32.530 --> 55:34.430
to build their snowman
and finish the hunt

55:34.465 --> 55:36.498
wins the prize.

55:36.534 --> 55:39.468
So, partner up
and Christmas Luck!

55:41.972 --> 55:43.739
Yes, of course.

55:43.774 --> 55:44.807
Let's do this.

55:44.842 --> 55:47.076
Oh... over here.

55:47.111 --> 55:49.411
Okay. Okay, they're leaving.
Here we go.

55:49.447 --> 55:51.313
"Santa was quick,
his face you did not see,

55:51.349 --> 55:53.782
but he left a piece
under the..."

55:53.818 --> 55:55.317
"Under the Christmas Tree!"

55:55.353 --> 55:56.285
The tree! Okay, okay.

55:58.155 --> 55:59.922
- Ha-ha!
- All right!

55:59.957 --> 56:01.423
- Next clue.
- Okay.

56:01.459 --> 56:03.525
"During the Christmas season,
carols are sung,

56:03.561 --> 56:05.294
find your last piece
where stockings are hung."

56:05.329 --> 56:06.595
This way!

56:09.500 --> 56:11.066
Ha!

56:13.003 --> 56:15.371
Ooh... Ahh!

56:18.843 --> 56:20.976
Ooh!

56:22.346 --> 56:23.445
Got it!

56:26.317 --> 56:28.317
Oh, here!

56:29.553 --> 56:31.120
Yes! Ah, boom!

56:36.327 --> 56:38.994
This reminds me of the Running
of the Bulls in Pamplona.

56:39.029 --> 56:41.397
Oh! How did you avoid
not getting trampled on?

56:41.432 --> 56:42.798
We survived
using our instincts.

56:42.833 --> 56:43.599
Oh.

56:43.634 --> 56:44.666
Some of
our highest ratings ever.

56:44.702 --> 56:45.734
You okay?

56:45.770 --> 56:47.102
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

56:50.441 --> 56:52.241
Up here, up here...

56:52.276 --> 56:53.475
Right over there! Yeah!

56:55.246 --> 56:57.212
Ah!

57:02.553 --> 57:04.653
Congrats, Dashers!

57:04.688 --> 57:08.056
You win dessert at Kringle's!

57:09.527 --> 57:11.393
Maybe next year.

57:11.429 --> 57:13.362
Yeah.
Maybe next year.

57:15.299 --> 57:17.199
I knew I picked
the best partner.

57:19.203 --> 57:20.436
Victory.

57:20.471 --> 57:22.171
That's great.
Rub it in.

57:22.206 --> 57:25.107
I thought the Tivoli Gardens
were charming at Christmas,

57:25.142 --> 57:26.909
but this is something else.

57:26.944 --> 57:28.110
Right, Alex?

57:28.145 --> 57:29.778
Remember Copenhagen?

57:29.814 --> 57:31.713
You mean,
like I wrote in my novel?

57:31.749 --> 57:34.383
Yeah, I'm glad
it was so vivid for you.

57:34.418 --> 57:36.685
Right. You were never there.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.753
It was an accurate description,
though.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.721
- Thank you.
- Hey, Sterling.

57:39.757 --> 57:42.424
Would you mind taking
a picture with our staff?

57:42.460 --> 57:43.525
They're huge fans.

57:43.561 --> 57:45.194
Yeah.

57:48.566 --> 57:50.199
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

57:50.234 --> 57:51.467
That was fun.

57:51.502 --> 57:53.702
Is the scavenger hunt
every year?

57:53.737 --> 57:56.472
It's one of the original
Midway attractions.

57:56.507 --> 57:58.540
My mom and I
were dash partners.

57:58.576 --> 58:00.242
Yeah.

58:00.277 --> 58:03.545
A lot of good memories.

58:03.581 --> 58:05.781
I love these events.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.616
You should take more time
for the things that you love.

58:07.651 --> 58:10.652
I know, but it just...

58:10.688 --> 58:12.654
it feels so selfish.

58:12.690 --> 58:14.656
But you can't give
what you don't have.

58:14.692 --> 58:16.492
It's important to refill
the tank now and again

58:16.527 --> 58:18.594
with things that make you happy.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.263
I'll think on that.

58:21.298 --> 58:23.065
- Okay, I'll take that.
- Okay.

58:31.709 --> 58:33.609
Aw!

58:37.548 --> 58:39.481
- Howdy.
- Hey.

58:42.386 --> 58:44.486
How's my favorite writer?

58:44.522 --> 58:46.355
About to submit
the next article.

58:46.390 --> 58:47.656
Should I read it first?

58:48.759 --> 58:49.725
Have you ever?

58:51.562 --> 58:54.229
Mm! I'm gonna need
five holiday hikes

58:54.265 --> 58:55.564
to walk off all this pie.

58:56.901 --> 58:58.400
All right, let's take a photo
for the website

58:58.435 --> 58:59.368
and the social media.

58:59.403 --> 59:00.402
For Aria.

59:00.437 --> 59:02.704
And again.

59:02.740 --> 59:03.705
Yeah, there you go.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.509
Do your thing.

59:09.413 --> 59:10.345
There you go.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.114
Perfect.

59:12.149 --> 59:14.016
That's a lot of filters, man.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.018
What's this?

59:16.053 --> 59:17.553
Oh, it's my Midway
Christmas passport.

59:17.588 --> 59:18.687
Helps me keep track
of my progress.

59:18.722 --> 59:19.621
You want one?

59:19.657 --> 59:21.123
Mm-mm.

59:21.158 --> 59:24.259
I can barely keep up
with my real passport.

59:24.295 --> 59:26.695
Is there anything to do
after 9:00 around here?

59:26.730 --> 59:28.730
Like, Karaoke?

59:28.766 --> 59:30.265
Bowling?

59:30.301 --> 59:31.099
I'm getting
a little stir-crazy.

59:31.135 --> 59:33.702
Sometimes, it's nice
to slow down.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.804
Just relax, be yourself.

59:35.839 --> 59:36.705
What happened to the guy

59:36.740 --> 59:38.407
who wanted to go to Tokyo
for Christmas?

59:38.442 --> 59:41.810
I guess I'm finding
the value in small towns.

59:41.845 --> 59:44.313
For a while,
writing was getting routine,

59:44.348 --> 59:45.981
but here,
I feel, uh...

59:46.016 --> 59:47.950
revitalized.

59:47.985 --> 59:49.952
- "Revitalized..."

59:49.987 --> 59:51.653
I like that.
You should use it.

59:51.689 --> 59:53.288
Yeah.

59:53.324 --> 59:55.223
I guess I'll work, too.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.893
I've got production notes
for a new special--

59:57.928 --> 59:59.461
"Journey to the Nile."

59:59.496 --> 01:00:01.763
TV gets all the good quests.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:04.466
Some stories are just
too big for the Internet.

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.735
Thanks for these articles.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.637
I couldn't go on these quests
without you.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.680
Well...

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:20.649
you two have become
fast friends.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:25.020
Yeah, yeah. It's funny
how that happens.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:27.689
Say, did I ever tell you

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:31.093
why my wife named this
"the Mistletoe Diner"?

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:33.261
That was for you, right?

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.963
Well, sort of, yeah.

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:37.299
No, see, she, um,

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.002
she liked to tell
this old folk story

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:42.871
about a beautiful princess,

01:00:42.906 --> 01:00:43.939
who was so enchanting

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:47.376
that every eligible bachelor
wanted to marry her,

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:52.314
but she was torn between
a prince and knight.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.317
She wasn't sure
which one really loved her.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:59.688
So, she sought the advice
of a wise old sage,

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:00.689
who told her

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:03.558
whoever could bring her
the magic mistletoe

01:01:03.594 --> 01:01:05.293
would be her true love.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:07.896
The magic mistletoe?

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.198
Oh, it's very special
mistletoe.

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.667
Very special, you see.

01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:14.036
Took an act of devotion
to even reach it.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:17.039
See, the sage explained
that,

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:20.042
if a man was willing
to risk everything

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:22.878
to gather
this mistletoe for her,

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:25.013
then he truly loved her.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:27.883
So who got the mistletoe?

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.751
The one who believed
in the magic.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:32.654
Please tell me
it was the knight.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:36.024
Come Christmas Day,
maybe you can tell me.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:38.460
I gotta go.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:09.024
Hey, buddy...
still looking good.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:38.820
Hey, Alex.

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:39.955
Hi.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.156
What about this crowd, huh?

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:42.290
Yeah.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:44.593
Sterling--he released
another one of those articles

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:45.794
and he had a picture on it--

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:47.395
It was him
eating a piece of pie.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.730
It's making an impact?

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.632
Absolutely!
Here. Ask Aria. Honey?

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.501
Alex! Hey!

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.169
Look at this turnout.

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:56.071
Did you hear the good news?

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:59.107
"Nothing epitomizes Christmas

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:01.143
like the delectable pies
of the Mistletoe Diner--

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.911
A special treat

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.780
that can revitalize

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:08.316
the Christmas spirit in
the most cantankerous Scrooge."

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:11.319
And, look, there's even
a picture to go along with it.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:14.623
I had to hire extra help
just to keep up with demand.

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:15.957
Just a little early
Christmas present.

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:16.992
I'm happy to help.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:18.527
The important thing

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:19.995
is the continued success
of Midway

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.196
and the Mistletoe Diner.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.164
Congratulations, Aria.

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:23.431
Thank you.

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.001
Bidding closes
in five minutes!

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:27.836
Remember, all proceeds

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:30.038
benefit Midway's
parks and rec center.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:34.276
These sensational ornaments
need a home for the holiday.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.644
Come on!

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:36.812
So, you, uh...

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.346
you might want to get in there.

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:40.482
There could be some magic
to be found.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.483
You know?

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:42.617
Right.

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.066
Find anything special?

01:03:58.101 --> 01:03:59.201
Yep.

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:00.669
Do you even have a tree?

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:02.237
I do, actually.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:04.639
I just wanted
a little keepsake from Midway.

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:06.875
Mm. Good thinking
on the pictures.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.176
Very effective.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.178
Yeah. Just doing my job.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:12.080
I submitted
the final article tonight.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.148
It's only the 22nd.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.249
I know.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:15.584
You have until Christmas Eve.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:16.685
I know.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.687
I added a little
holiday folklore

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:20.355
that I hope will make
Christmas day

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:21.890
special...

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.892
you know,
for the readers.

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.894
Hmm.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:35.904
And now, for the final winner
of the evening...

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:38.874
So did you make
the winning bid?

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.041
I think so. Yeah.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.011
Oh, my.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:46.114
We have a true Santa Claus
in the crowd.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:50.118
For the beautiful crystal
mistletoe ornament,

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:53.255
the winning bid goes
for $1,000!

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.094
It's a worthy cause.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.731
I had a feeling it was you.

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:05.233
Perfect keepsake
to remind me of Midway

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:07.435
and the charming
Mistletoe Diner.

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:09.704
You've done
so much for Midway.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.239
It's nothing.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:12.440
I haven't been
this excited about an ornament

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:13.808
since I found
the Christmas pickle

01:05:13.844 --> 01:05:14.976
at a Christmas market
in Berlin.

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:16.111
A German tradition.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.213
The first to find it on the tree
is assured good luck.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.383
But I have a feeling
this one is much more special.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:25.553
I'm sure you find
something special in every city.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.389
Let's just say
Midway is a standout.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.090
Thanks to you, Aria.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:31.893
I'm surprised
that Alex didn't bid.

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:33.695
Have you seen him?

01:05:34.765 --> 01:05:36.932
Nope.

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:44.940
Well...

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:48.109
no wonder you haven't
returned my phone calls.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.614
I've been baking since dawn.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.516
Whew!

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:57.319
Honey, th-there's something
that I've noticed

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:58.586
about Sterling.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.821
Oh, I know!

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:01.256
He's the Mistletoe Man.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.124
Huh? Sterling?

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.459
Yeah!

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:05.327
"Christmas

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:07.829
is full of folklore
and traditions,

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:08.964
but in Midway,

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:11.099
none compare to the enchantment
of the Mistletoe Man

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:11.933
and his devotion

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.769
to win the heart
of a fair princess--

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:18.006
A knight in shining armor
who must embark on a quest,

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:21.676
climbing the highest peak
to find a magical mistletoe.

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:23.878
Such a tale
is not without competition

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:26.114
from an arrogant prince,

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.049
but the knight's heart
is true.

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:29.484
In the end,

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:33.054
it is his belief in magic
that finds the mistletoe

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.023
and a kiss
that lasts a lifetime."

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:38.360
Ohh! It's just like
what Mom used to talk about.

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:40.395
I can't believe
he knew the story!

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.630
Well, honey, I actually--

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.367
Dad, Sterling, he bought
the mistletoe ornament.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:47.569
I don't know.
I think it's fate.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.304
Well, I'm not sure that--

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.805
You always tell me
to let my guard down

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:53.341
and take a chance,
and I'm finally doing it.

01:06:53.377 --> 01:06:55.176
Sterling and I,

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:57.078
we're having dinner tonight
at Kringle's.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:06:58.513
Kringle's?

01:06:58.548 --> 01:06:59.514
- Mm-hmm!

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.716
Well, that's where I proposed
to your mama.

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.084
I know. Oh!

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.719
Well, have you considered,
honey, that--

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:07.222
I have to go get ready.
Wish me luck.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:09.524
I don't know, maybe I'll find
a little magic this Christmas.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.272
This is nice.

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:26.107
Just the two of us,
finally.

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:27.208
It is.

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.309
I keep looking
over my shoulder,

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:31.279
thinking the Christmas Council
is going to appear.

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:33.348
You're like the star
on top of the Christmas tree.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:35.717
Everyone looks up to you.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:36.785
That's a real honor.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.619
I love how you find

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.988
a greater meaning
behind everything.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:42.357
Value in
the tiniest details.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.159
You know, I had

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.728
this larger-than-life
image of you in my head.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:49.030
I didn't know
what to expect.

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:51.199
People can be different
in person.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.535
I hope I'm better.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:54.469
I thought
you were just being nice

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.137
when you bought
the mistletoe ornament...

01:07:57.441 --> 01:07:59.874
but now I know it's more.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.277
Meeting you has been
the best part of this trip.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.847
You see me for
more than just my...

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.215
celebrity.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.217
I'm so glad I stayed.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.319
You were leaving?

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:12.754
Yeah, I had a flight booked
the day of the market.

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:15.723
Hmm. What about your articles?

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.325
You had only published
one by then.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.362
I did extensive research
before I met you.

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.865
I had everything I needed
to write about Midway.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.435
Anything else?

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.069
Um, no, I think we're good.

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:30.238
Wonderful.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.840
I can stamp
your Christmas passports.

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:35.376
I... don't have one.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:37.712
Maybe next time.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.881
No Christmas passport?

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:40.948
Mm-mm.

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:41.950
So, uh...

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.919
how did you know about
the Mistletoe Man story?

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:47.055
Man?
I thought it was a pie.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:48.389
You wrote about it.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:50.959
Oh, right.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.359
Um...

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:53.862
Alex told me.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:55.063
Alex?

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:57.064
Mm-hmm.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.600
Oh...

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.103
I can't believe
I didn't realize it.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.538
It was him the whole time.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:09.477
Show business is complicated.

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:10.979
I think,
once you hear me out,

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:12.981
you'll see how funny
it really is.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.483
Alex is my best friend
and ghostwriter.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.785
He practically runs
the website.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.621
It's very common
in this industry.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.990
And when I read his review
for Midway,

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:24.158
well, I had to come
see it for myself.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.926
My agent thought
it'd be a great place

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.162
to promote my new book.

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:30.098
A compilation
of your travel articles...

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.131
Mm-hmm.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.734
Alex's articles.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.671
But meeting you
changed everything.

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:38.740
I felt a connection, too.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.308
And Alex and I
made an agreement,

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.577
that he would help me
get to know you better,

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:44.578
and I would help get him
a meeting with my publisher.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.913
For his novel.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.482
So...

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:50.484
A charade and an agreement?

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.687
No...
wow, that sounds bad.

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:53.654
Forget everything I said.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.990
Believe me, everyone
had the best intentions.

01:09:56.026 --> 01:09:58.493
Finding the magic
and the mistletoe...

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.428
You knew nothing about that?

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.764
I wish I did.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.999
I think it would really
help right now.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:08.336
This is just
a simple misunderstanding.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.004
I'm still the same Sterling.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.539
You get it, right?

01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:14.075
That's exactly why
I have to go.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.111
Merry Christmas, Sterling.

01:10:17.147 --> 01:10:18.846
Thank you for dinner,
but I need to go find Alex.

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:34.095
Alex.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:36.864
Aria.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.466
I thought
you were out with Sterling.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:40.201
I was

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:42.403
and he told me everything.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:45.506
Okay. Uh...

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:48.042
I'm so sorry.
I can explain.

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:49.244
Everything I told you,

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:50.645
all the times
we were together,

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.481
and you just let me carry on
like a fool.

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:55.550
And for what?

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.085
I thought we were friends.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.386
We are.
I-It's complicated.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.554
I didn't have a choice.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:02.390
No. You had a choice
and you made it.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.325
You just wanted
a book published.

01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:06.194
Look, Aria, please.

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:08.196
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I-I just can't trust you.

01:11:21.745 --> 01:11:22.944
Mm-mm-mm.

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:24.412
I heard you were checking out.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:27.248
The road is my life...

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.783
and I thought
I'd surprise my parents.

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.518
Come home on Christmas Eve
for once.

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:32.353
Crazy as it sounds,

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:34.522
hanging out in Midway's
made me a little homesick.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:36.591
You and Aria?

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.026
We weren't meant to be.

01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:39.727
But I think
I know who might be.

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.429
I really screwed it up
for you, didn't I?

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:43.231
Only as soon as you got here.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:45.533
You gonna give up?

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.536
Last night,

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.571
Aria mentioned
this mistletoe story.

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:51.873
Since she abandoned me
at the restaurant,

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:52.907
I had time to read it.

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:54.275
What'd you think?

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:55.943
You're the Mistletoe Man.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:59.881
The last article is practically
a love letter to her and Midway.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:00.782
That's why you bid
on the ornament.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.550
Yeah, I didn't expect you
to double it.

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:04.585
I was just trying to show off.

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:06.421
If I had known,
I would've backed off.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.991
I had a plan to tell her
Christmas Day.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:12.727
After the articles
and, cross my fingers,

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:13.928
you were gone.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.897
Tonight is Christmas Eve.

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:17.098
You still have time.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:18.433
She won't return my calls.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:20.134
Well, use the website.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.269
<i>Your</i> website?

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.105
This Christmas...

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.406
write your story,

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.774
with your name.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.609
What about the contract?
Legally, I can't.

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.644
Leave that to me.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:32.246
I'll have the website updated
with your name.

01:12:32.282 --> 01:12:34.248
It's time to give credit
where credit's due.

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:37.919
Besides...
we make a great team.

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:39.287
Partner?

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.256
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:44.125
Partner.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.760
Well, I have a plane to catch

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.895
and you have
some writing to do.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:49.931
Sterling?

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.432
Yeah?

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:53.768
Thanks, buddy.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.670
Thank you.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:58.806
Yeah, all right.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:00.375
Hmm?

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:02.677
Just-- let's get it over with.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:04.612
Merry Christmas, Alex.

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:06.414
Yeah, Merry Christmas,
you giant.

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:12.720
There's one more favor
I need to ask you, actually.

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:14.422
Okay.

01:13:31.341 --> 01:13:34.375
I thought you'd be on
your way back to the big city.

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.512
I've grown an appreciation
for small towns.

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:40.481
Would you care to take a seat?

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:41.516
Mm-mm.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.050
Okay.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:44.719
I tried calling.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.687
It's been busy.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.823
Call it
the Sterling Masters spike.

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:50.525
I want to explain--

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.759
It's not necessary.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:54.262
I understand why you did it.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:56.164
Your career, the book.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:58.266
It's the most important
thing to you.

01:13:58.301 --> 01:13:59.934
No, no. No. Not anymore.

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:03.070
You.
This-This-This... place.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.505
Midway, it's changed me.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.674
That's nice,

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:09.377
but you were always going
back to your big city.

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:10.745
I've seen it before.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.712
And, let's be honest,

01:14:11.748 --> 01:14:14.949
this was all just
one Big Holiday Adventure.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:17.051
Aria, I've been
to every big city in the world

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:18.719
and none of them

01:14:18.755 --> 01:14:20.354
have inspired me
like Midway.

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:22.356
I've been searching
my whole life

01:14:22.392 --> 01:14:25.426
for a special place
that felt like home,

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:26.861
but after meeting you,

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:29.897
I've realized
that it's not the place,

01:14:29.933 --> 01:14:31.399
it's the...

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:32.733
it's the people.

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:34.602
It's hard to believe you.

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:36.370
I had plan to tell you.

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:38.773
Sterling,
he is my best friend,

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.608
he is my business partner.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.376
It's complicated.

01:14:42.412 --> 01:14:44.779
Do you see
how complicated this was?

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.648
"Complicated."
The key word.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.550
Okay, you're not gonna sit,
I'm gonna stand.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.223
My flight, it leaves tonight,
Christmas Eve,

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:57.492
but I'll stay...

01:14:57.527 --> 01:14:58.793
if that's what you want.

01:14:58.828 --> 01:14:59.894
- And then what?

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:01.829
Christmas is over
and you leave.

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:04.465
I have my life here
and you have yours.

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:07.134
We just want different things.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.936
Now I need
to get back to mine.

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:10.738
Merry Christmas, Alex.

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:12.807
Wait, uh...

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:16.911
Read the website.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.183
Honey?

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:57.385
Huh?

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.653
Penny for your thoughts.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:00.521
Oh, it's nothing.

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:04.058
Really?

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.694
Alex came by today.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:08.729
And?

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:10.298
Well...

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:11.966
he said that

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:14.702
he had never really felt at home
until he came to Midway,

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:16.170
and until he met me.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:17.905
Oh, that.

01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:19.340
I mean, I knew that.

01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:22.076
Everybody knows that!

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:23.611
- What?
- Oh, uh...

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:30.217
"I was struck by Aria Eubanks,

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.053
dynamic
Christmas Council president

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.754
and owner
of the Mistletoe diner--

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:36.223
The personification
of Christmas.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.426
Generous, joyous,
pure of heart.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:41.062
Her dedication to Midway
is endearing.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.731
Her enthusiasm, contagious.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:46.767
Like witnessing
the Northern Lights

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:48.769
dance across a midnight sky,

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:51.606
you can't help
but be mesmerized."

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:53.808
Aww...

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.511
I ruined it.

01:16:57.547 --> 01:16:59.046
Oh, come on, now.

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:01.048
Come on.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.084
O-Open that box.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.720
You always feel better
when you open a present.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.728
Aww.

01:17:13.763 --> 01:17:15.463
Well...

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:18.332
Now, he is obviously
smitten by you.

01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:21.335
So why don't you run on over
to the Sugarplum Lodge

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:22.470
and see him?

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:23.971
Are you gonna say
"I told you so"?

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.306
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.408
So what are you gonna do?

01:17:27.443 --> 01:17:28.576
I have an idea.

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:34.515
But I'm gonna need some help
and a little Christmas magic.

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.384
We can do that.

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:05.012
Leslie. Checking out.

01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:06.213
Sure you don't want to stay?

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:07.314
It's Christmas Eve.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.683
No.

01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:10.685
No, no real reason to stay.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.720
Did you collect
all your passport stamps?

01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:16.557
Kringle's stamped last night
with, uh, takeout.

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:19.627
I'm missing...

01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:20.561
Chestnut Canyon.

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:21.829
Alex!

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.064
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you.

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:26.367
I was so deeply moved
by your article.

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:29.336
I had no idea
that you wrote so passionately!

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:32.173
You could write for the theater.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.574
Well, if I ever
become a playwright,

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.476
you will be
my first lead actress.

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.011
Oh!

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:40.748
Okay. Um...

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:42.049
My keys.

01:18:42.085 --> 01:18:44.151
Have you--
Have you guys seen my keys?

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:45.252
Oh, what do they look like?

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:46.887
Car keys.

01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:47.988
I, uh...

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:50.357
I gotta return my rental.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:52.393
I just had them here.

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:54.695
Oh, we have a complimentary
car service to the airport.

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:55.930
The keys have to be close by.

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:56.931
We'll take care of it.

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:58.399
My rental car?

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:00.367
In Utah, we're very friendly.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:01.535
Don't worry about it.

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:03.104
- Leslie will take care of it.
- We do this all the time.

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.405
Okay.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.040
Wh-Where's the car service?

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:07.274
The driver is outside.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.009
Yeah! Sure. Thank you.

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:10.511
Uh, nice meeting you, Leslie.

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:12.113
- I swear that I had the--
- I know, I know.

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:13.180
Come on!

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:14.882
Things get lost.

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:18.085
You have a great trip now.
Bye-bye.

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:25.926
Thank you so much.

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:26.927
Craig?

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:28.195
Hey, buddy.

01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:29.196
It's Christmas Eve, Craig.

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:31.398
Aren't you supposed
to be with your family?

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:33.567
In Midway, we're all family.

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.870
You needed a lift,
I'm here for ya.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.071
Okay.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:38.105
Thank you.

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:43.778
Sure gonna miss you.

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:47.982
I'm glad someone will.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.085
Oh, come on.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.787
We all will.

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:54.555
You'll always have
a home in Midway.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:02.730
Did you go
to Chestnut Canyon?

01:20:02.765 --> 01:20:04.765
The lookout is gorgeous.

01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:06.300
No.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.669
That was the one passport stamp
I missed.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:10.137
What?

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:12.473
You can't leave town
without seeing it.

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:14.775
I worked really hard on it.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.477
I'm not sure
if there's time, Craig.

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.078
I've got a plane to catch.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.982
Craig, it's fine.

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.117
No.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.251
You have to see it.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.353
My plane leaves in, uh...

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:27.421
Go on! Take a look.
I'm pretty sure

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:29.824
your family might wanna
see you tonight, Craig.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:32.293
- Get your passport stamped.
- Okay, I'm gonna get the stamp.

01:20:43.573 --> 01:20:45.472
Aria?

01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:56.183
Need a stamp
for your passport?

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:58.452
Did you do all this?

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:00.621
With some help.

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:04.491
All this time,

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.861
I was falling for you.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:11.866
Your writing opened my mind...

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:14.501
but being with you
opened my heart.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.337
You're worth the risk.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.172
I'm certain of it.

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:21.208
Please, stay.

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:23.344
At least till Christmas?

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:28.649
I thought I'd find

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:31.819
the best place
to celebrate Christmas...

01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:35.856
I found something better.

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:37.691
What's that?

01:21:37.727 --> 01:21:39.260
You.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.297
I'm so sorry.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.999
I should've told you the truth
from the beginning.

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:48.602
The moment I saw you...

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.504
I knew

01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:52.873
you're the kinda girl
you keep close forever.

01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:57.945
This passport
really kinda works.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.747
It brought me home.

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:02.616
To a feeling or a place?

01:22:02.652 --> 01:22:04.585
Both.

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:24.939
Wow.

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:27.608
Anything is possible
at Christmas.

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:42.289
So... who ended up
with the magic?

01:22:42.325 --> 01:22:44.391
Was it the prince
or the knight?

01:22:44.427 --> 01:22:46.226
Thankfully, the knight.

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:47.428
All right, all right!

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:50.230
Between us mistletoe men, okay?

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:52.599
Mm-hmm.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:55.069
I guess mistletoe magic
is real.

01:22:57.273 --> 01:22:58.973
Yes, it is.
Merry Christmas.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:01.842
Merry Christmas.

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:02.943
Oh!

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:05.813
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:23:05.848 --> 01:23:08.382
Merry Christmas!
