Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:07.235 --> 00:08.401
Wanna go fishing tomorrow morning?

00:08.403 --> 00:09.502
Didn't you just say
you have an appointment

00:09.504 --> 00:10.703
with Dr. Greene tomorrow morning?

00:10.705 --> 00:11.438
He never came in for the procedure.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.439
What?

00:12.441 --> 00:14.474
- How's Jack?
- Not so hot.

00:14.476 --> 00:16.576
I had him rest
while we head back to shore.

00:16.578 --> 00:18.578
I have a fully fleshed out business plan.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.647
I know that's your plan.

00:20.649 --> 00:22.082
But what if it's not my plan?

00:22.084 --> 00:23.716
It's my job to grow the business.

00:23.718 --> 00:24.918
Not this business.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.319
Not this way.

00:26.321 --> 00:28.388
I purposefully kept the family
away from this event, Claudette,

00:28.390 --> 00:29.789
so what are you doing here?

00:29.791 --> 00:31.324
The Rateniczes thought that a christening

00:31.326 --> 00:33.927
was the ideal place
to extend an olive branch.

00:33.929 --> 00:35.261
Your parents cut you off,

00:35.263 --> 00:37.197
and his parents stuck you
with the wedding bill.

00:37.199 --> 00:38.965
It's not right. Here's my pitch,

00:38.967 --> 00:40.533
I buy your 1/3 stake in Hankmed.

00:40.535 --> 00:41.768
- Evan...
- The moment you can

00:41.770 --> 00:43.236
buy it back, it's yours again.

00:43.238 --> 00:47.006
Sure there are more than
enough medical professionals

00:47.008 --> 00:48.875
to keep an eye on me overnight.

00:48.877 --> 00:52.645
I'm not staying as your doctor.

00:52.647 --> 00:54.080
I'm staying as your friend.

00:56.717 --> 00:59.452
We lost him.

00:59.454 --> 01:01.521
Jack's dead.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:11.165 --> 01:14.934
So I... I'm supposed to fly
to London tomorrow,

01:14.936 --> 01:18.538
but someone's passed away,
and I need to change my plans.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.106
Yeah, I'll hold.

01:20.108 --> 01:21.975
Let's just move
Jill's nephew to next week.

01:21.977 --> 01:24.177
Luke starts camp next week.

01:24.179 --> 01:27.213
Okay, then, uh... you see Luke,

01:27.215 --> 01:29.015
and we'll just move the Grants
to next week.

01:29.017 --> 01:31.050
The Grants are leaving
for Hawaii this weekend.

01:31.052 --> 01:32.919
Wow, okay, so why don't...

01:32.921 --> 01:34.888
there's the, um...

01:34.890 --> 01:36.156
this is harder than Sudoku.

01:36.158 --> 01:37.724
Can't Dr. Van Dyke fill in again?

01:37.726 --> 01:38.992
He wasn't Hankmed material.

01:38.994 --> 01:40.260
No follow-through.

01:40.262 --> 01:42.529
You know, if I'd had more time
to mentor him,

01:42.531 --> 01:44.297
yeah, he could've become
a world-class concierge doctor...

01:44.299 --> 01:46.399
Yeah, hi, I need to postpone my flight.

01:46.401 --> 01:48.801
No, please don't put me on hold again.

01:48.803 --> 01:50.436
Or just do it anyway.

01:50.438 --> 01:52.639
Babe, you didn't even know him,

01:52.641 --> 01:53.740
so you don't have to be there.

01:53.742 --> 01:55.875
Are you gonna be there?

01:55.877 --> 01:58.411
- Yeah.
- Then so will I.

01:58.413 --> 01:59.546
Yes, hi, I'm here.

01:59.548 --> 02:01.147
Okay, why don't you just tell me

02:01.149 --> 02:02.549
which clients are in town next week.

02:02.551 --> 02:03.883
Okay, I am talking... yeah,

02:03.885 --> 02:05.118
the... the red-eye Friday could work.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.787
What are you guys doing?

02:07.789 --> 02:10.089
We're, uh, just changing
some plans around.

02:10.091 --> 02:11.491
Why?

02:14.495 --> 02:18.531
Well... you took
a two-hour walk yesterday,

02:18.533 --> 02:19.899
and an even longer one
this morning, so...

02:19.901 --> 02:21.534
So?

02:21.536 --> 02:24.404
Henry, I didn't know Jack
very well, but I know you.

02:24.406 --> 02:26.439
I know what you're feeling right now,

02:26.441 --> 02:29.509
and I know why, so...

02:29.511 --> 02:31.344
Just let me handle everything.

02:31.346 --> 02:32.946
Seriously. At least till
after the funeral.

02:32.948 --> 02:35.315
First of all, Evan, I don't
need you to handle anything,

02:35.317 --> 02:39.085
and second of all,
there won't be any funeral.

02:39.087 --> 02:40.820
I checked with Jack's attorney,

02:40.822 --> 02:42.622
and Jack's attorney checked Jack's will.

02:42.624 --> 02:45.225
It specified that
he didn't want a funeral.

02:45.227 --> 02:47.360
Well, I guess that does sound like Jack.

02:47.362 --> 02:49.429
The will prohibited moping too.

02:49.431 --> 02:50.430
Hmm? Hmm?

03:00.507 --> 03:01.774
This is Hank.

03:01.776 --> 03:03.076
How can I make you feel better today?

03:18.092 --> 03:20.660
Bobby not able to push out.

03:20.662 --> 03:22.495
It's okay, Mrs. Sesumi. It's okay.

03:22.497 --> 03:25.398
Let me just take a look.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.034
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:28.036 --> 03:31.304
Whoa. Okay.

03:31.306 --> 03:32.772
Can you guys tell me how he did it?

03:34.876 --> 03:37.210
We were just making our little movie

03:37.212 --> 03:39.379
down in the woods.
Uh, we took a lunch break,

03:39.381 --> 03:41.614
and the next thing we knew,
Bobby was sucking face

03:41.616 --> 03:43.216
with this chocolaty beverage.

03:43.218 --> 03:44.350
Shut up!

03:44.352 --> 03:46.486
I'm Devon. Uh, I got your number

03:46.488 --> 03:47.754
from my friend Tucker Bryant.

03:47.756 --> 03:51.124
9-1-1. We ambulance ride for Bobby?

03:51.126 --> 03:52.225
We don't need an ambulance, okay?

03:52.227 --> 03:53.760
If I can break the suction,

03:53.762 --> 03:55.795
I should be able
to remove Bobby's tongue.

03:55.797 --> 03:58.197
Hold that, Bobby? Okay.

04:04.338 --> 04:09.175
Okay, I'm gonna anesthetize
the inside of your mouth.

04:09.177 --> 04:10.810
- Mm!
- All right.

04:10.812 --> 04:13.613
I know it pinches a little bit.

04:13.615 --> 04:16.349
- Ow!
- Okay.

04:16.351 --> 04:17.950
Good job, bud.

04:27.061 --> 04:30.763
Here we go.

04:30.765 --> 04:33.333
One, two, three.

04:36.170 --> 04:37.904
- Ah!
- I know, I know.

04:37.906 --> 04:40.540
There we go. Okay, okay.

04:40.542 --> 04:41.808
That's in.

04:49.650 --> 04:53.353
That's it. There we go.

04:53.355 --> 04:56.089
- Okay.
- Thank you.

04:56.091 --> 04:58.758
- Thank you.
- Okay, Mrs. Sesumi, okay.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.861
Bobby.

05:01.863 --> 05:05.331
So, uh, which one of you is older?

05:06.734 --> 05:08.768
I'm the ranking brother here.

05:08.770 --> 05:11.003
That's a big title, Devon.

05:11.005 --> 05:12.705
That means it's your job
to take better care

05:12.707 --> 05:15.208
of your little brother.
'Cause I'd really rather

05:15.210 --> 05:17.477
not be back here this weekend.

05:17.479 --> 05:18.478
Got it?

05:19.947 --> 05:22.882
- Got it.
- Okay.

05:22.884 --> 05:25.151
- That was perfect.
- Yeah.

05:28.222 --> 05:29.455
- Nina.
- Hey.

05:29.457 --> 05:31.157
- Hey.
- Hank.

05:31.159 --> 05:33.126
Um... did you get my messages?

05:33.128 --> 05:35.795
Uh, yeah, I did, I did.
I'm sorry for not calling back.

05:35.797 --> 05:37.730
Well, I, um... I just... I thought maybe

05:37.732 --> 05:40.266
you might wanna... debrief.

05:40.268 --> 05:41.434
You mean talk?

05:41.436 --> 05:43.803
Yeah. I mean talk.

05:43.805 --> 05:46.572
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:46.574 --> 05:48.841
Yeah, I mean, it's... it's never easy

05:48.843 --> 05:50.943
with... with someone so young

05:50.945 --> 05:54.614
and full of life. And you?

05:54.616 --> 05:57.049
Yeah, yeah. I'm working through it.

05:57.051 --> 06:02.188
Hank, you did everything you could.

06:02.190 --> 06:05.425
Yeah, then I guess
there's not much to, uh...

06:05.427 --> 06:06.526
debrief about.

06:06.528 --> 06:08.161
Sorry, I gotta run.

06:08.163 --> 06:09.796
But I'll give you a call later.

06:44.598 --> 06:45.698
Oh.

06:45.700 --> 06:46.899
Can I help you?

06:46.901 --> 06:50.136
No, sorry. I'm good.

07:22.161 --> 07:28.161
Royal Pains 3x16 - This One's For Jack
Original air date February 22, 2012

Sync and corrected by atrn97g

07:35.052 --> 07:36.786
Peaceful relations are important

07:36.788 --> 07:39.722
to the entire family.

07:39.724 --> 07:40.923
That might have been considered

07:40.925 --> 07:43.726
before the attempt on my life.

07:43.728 --> 07:45.928
Not to mention the attempt on Marisa's.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.730
Neither of which was orchestrated

07:47.732 --> 07:49.532
by the Von Jurgens.

07:49.534 --> 07:52.368
Which is why I am here
to set things right.

07:52.370 --> 07:53.636
Yeah.

07:53.638 --> 07:54.904
Well, your branch of the family

07:54.906 --> 07:57.907
has always been known for its diplomacy.

07:57.909 --> 07:58.875
Thank you.

08:01.813 --> 08:04.480
<i>Nein, Friedrich, danke.</i>

08:04.482 --> 08:07.416
It's also been known
for its naked ambition,

08:07.418 --> 08:09.185
shall we say?

08:09.187 --> 08:11.287
So, then, Claudette,

08:11.289 --> 08:14.857
why else are you here?

08:14.859 --> 08:16.792
Money.

08:18.695 --> 08:20.363
Venture capital, to be specific.

08:20.365 --> 08:22.265
<i>Voila.</i>

08:22.267 --> 08:27.570
So the tradition of the Von
Jurgens approaching Kuesters

08:27.572 --> 08:31.340
with their hat in hand is alive and well.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.115
It's an intriguing idea.

08:39.116 --> 08:43.152
But I'd like to vet it.

08:43.154 --> 08:45.354
Vet it how?

08:45.356 --> 08:48.724
By watching you present it
to a potential client.

08:52.329 --> 08:54.730
Evan, I'm here.

08:54.732 --> 08:57.466
- Okay, close your eyes.
- What?

08:57.468 --> 08:58.668
- Close your eyes. Close 'em.
- Okay...

08:58.670 --> 09:00.770
Close.

09:04.608 --> 09:07.410
Whoa.

09:07.412 --> 09:09.178
What's this for?

09:09.180 --> 09:11.147
So I uploaded all my pictures of me,

09:11.149 --> 09:12.715
and then I set the display

09:12.717 --> 09:14.517
so you're gonna get
60 different pictures of me

09:14.519 --> 09:16.953
per hour, 24 hours a day,

09:16.955 --> 09:17.954
for the full eight weeks
you're in Britain.

09:19.290 --> 09:22.792
And just so you won't
be staring at me the whole time,

09:22.794 --> 09:24.160
put some pictures of us in there.

09:24.162 --> 09:25.161
Aw.

09:25.163 --> 09:26.362
Thank you.

09:26.364 --> 09:29.899
- It's awesome.
- So...

09:29.901 --> 09:31.334
where are the rest of your bags?

09:31.336 --> 09:33.102
What do you mean? This is it.

09:33.104 --> 09:35.037
- What about my checklist?
- Evan, I am gonna

09:35.039 --> 09:36.472
be painting the whole time I'm there

09:36.474 --> 09:37.707
in jeans and a T-shirt.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.075
Did you pack a raincoat?

09:39.077 --> 09:40.209
Um...

09:40.211 --> 09:41.711
Are you kidding me? You're kid...

09:41.713 --> 09:43.346
England invented rain.

09:43.348 --> 09:46.215
Fine. I'll take yours.

09:46.217 --> 09:47.216
You'll be glad you did.

09:47.218 --> 09:49.251
Okay.

09:49.253 --> 09:53.022
For what it's worth,

09:53.024 --> 09:54.924
you were right about the rain thing.

09:54.926 --> 09:57.360
And I made you some tea, by the by.

09:57.362 --> 10:00.529
Thank you.

10:00.531 --> 10:03.833
Wait, why are you admitting
I was right about something?

10:03.835 --> 10:05.835
I owe you one.

10:05.837 --> 10:07.136
I mean, a big one.

10:07.138 --> 10:09.705
I can't tell you what a relief it is

10:09.707 --> 10:11.240
to wake up in the morning without...

10:11.242 --> 10:14.410
that debt to Raj's parents
just weighing on me.

10:14.412 --> 10:16.212
You don't owe me anything, okay?

10:16.214 --> 10:19.281
The only thing you owe me
is bringing back vintage Divya,

10:19.283 --> 10:21.283
'cause this is starting
to feel like <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

10:21.285 --> 10:26.122
Hankmed. Hi.

10:26.124 --> 10:28.758
Yes?

10:28.760 --> 10:31.961
Uh, I understand. I will be there.

10:31.963 --> 10:35.831
Great.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.967
Boris wants to have
a Hankmed business meeting.

10:37.969 --> 10:40.736
I gotta go.

10:40.738 --> 10:42.838
What about Hank?

10:42.840 --> 10:46.008
Hank, uh, has enough to deal with.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.044
You don't think that, uh, Hank can grieve

10:48.046 --> 10:49.145
and do business at the same time?

10:49.147 --> 10:51.781
Trust me, I've seen this before.

10:51.783 --> 10:52.948
Recently?

10:52.950 --> 10:54.517
Nope, about 20 years ago.

10:54.519 --> 10:58.154
Hey, Evan, I... I hope
you don't mind me saying so,

10:58.156 --> 10:59.455
but isn't there a difference

10:59.457 --> 11:01.590
between losing Jack and losing your mum?

11:08.231 --> 11:11.634
Hank doesn't deal with tragedy well.

11:11.636 --> 11:14.537
The day our mom died
was the day his childhood ended,

11:14.539 --> 11:17.573
and ever since then,
he's taken responsibility

11:17.575 --> 11:19.141
for everyone and everything,

11:19.143 --> 11:21.043
and he always refused to share it.

11:21.045 --> 11:23.846
So this time, I can help carry the load.

11:23.848 --> 11:26.682
Good luck at the meeting, then.

11:26.684 --> 11:28.984
Okay.

11:28.986 --> 11:32.621
Okay, so...

11:32.623 --> 11:34.457
please stop being so nice to me.

11:34.459 --> 11:38.594
It's making me feel very uncomfortable.

11:38.596 --> 11:42.631
Thank you.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.366
Babe, I'll be back soon. I love you, bye.

11:44.368 --> 11:45.701
Love you too. Miss you already, bye.

11:45.703 --> 11:48.070
- Ha. Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

11:48.072 --> 11:50.239
Not much. I just, uh...

11:50.241 --> 11:51.841
can't really socialize
'cause I'm running late.

11:51.843 --> 11:52.842
Late for what?

11:52.844 --> 11:53.876
Now I'm even later.

11:53.878 --> 11:55.077
Evan.

11:55.079 --> 11:56.579
I have a meeting with Boris.

11:56.581 --> 12:00.483
Really? About what?

12:00.485 --> 12:02.218
I don't know. I'll tell you
after the meeting.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.086
He set a meeting with you. One-on-one.

12:04.088 --> 12:06.889
He asked for Hankmed's
business expertise,

12:06.891 --> 12:09.125
so I figured I'd cover for you,

12:09.127 --> 12:10.860
because you've got enough to deal with.

12:10.862 --> 12:13.362
Evan, I'm fine, thank you,

12:13.364 --> 12:15.064
and if there's a Hankmed meeting
with Boris,

12:15.066 --> 12:16.699
business or otherwise,
I'm gonna be there.

12:16.701 --> 12:20.202
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:20.204 --> 12:21.470
All right, let's go, then.

12:24.074 --> 12:27.109
Come on, Richard. Isn't that
all a spring shoe needs?

12:27.111 --> 12:31.080
A sense of whimsy and a pointed gold toe?

12:31.082 --> 12:34.717
<i>De belles chaussures.</i>
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

12:34.719 --> 12:36.719
The editor of French <i>Vogue</i> and I disagree

12:36.721 --> 12:38.754
on what women
are lusting after this year.

12:38.756 --> 12:41.757
Ah. <i>Ce n'est pas un probleme.</i>

12:41.759 --> 12:43.859
So, Ms. Adams, I see that Dr. Van Dyke

12:43.861 --> 12:45.761
examined you last week
when he was working with us.

12:45.763 --> 12:49.031
He did, but he never called me
back with my test results.

12:49.033 --> 12:51.934
Let me apologize on his behalf.

12:51.936 --> 12:55.504
I see that your coronary artery
disease is stable.

12:55.506 --> 12:57.807
Are you still taking
the sublingual nitroglycerin

12:57.809 --> 12:59.341
- for chest pain?
- I am.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.443
But why are tightness and
pressure so bad in the morning?

13:01.445 --> 13:05.147
Well, well, let's find out, shall we?

13:05.149 --> 13:08.551
Head back.

13:13.523 --> 13:14.790
- Ah.
- Ah.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.125
- Ah.
- Ah.

13:20.163 --> 13:22.531
Are you ever sleepy during the day?

13:22.533 --> 13:24.567
At night, I wake up every two hours

13:24.569 --> 13:26.135
to a call about a fashion emergency

13:26.137 --> 13:28.170
in some far-flung corner
of the world, so, yes.

13:28.172 --> 13:30.139
I'm always tired during the day,

13:30.141 --> 13:32.608
but that's the life
of a fashion consultant.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.578
Did anyone ever tell you
that you have a deviated septum?

13:35.580 --> 13:38.480
No, but I don't let too many people

13:38.482 --> 13:40.115
have a look around in there.

13:40.117 --> 13:43.719
Well, it may be giving you
obstructive sleep apnea,

13:43.721 --> 13:46.755
which, in conjunction
with your coronary disease,

13:46.757 --> 13:48.991
could be causing nocturnal angina,

13:48.993 --> 13:52.161
and that could put you
at risk for arrhythmias,

13:52.163 --> 13:55.397
and, uh, even a heart attack.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.399
So I'd like to take you to a sleep center

13:57.401 --> 13:59.034
so we can monitor you at night.

13:59.036 --> 14:00.402
I'm sorry. That's not gonna be possible.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.639
I have a new men's collection
to critique and review.

14:03.641 --> 14:05.608
Okay.

14:05.610 --> 14:09.178
Then I'll just bring
the sleep center to you.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.747
As you can see,

14:11.749 --> 14:13.983
we've already established
ourselves in the E.U.,

14:13.985 --> 14:16.952
but we all know
that real success requires

14:16.954 --> 14:18.754
penetrating the American market.

14:18.756 --> 14:21.357
And we all know that concierge medicine

14:21.359 --> 14:24.093
and technology go hand in hand.

14:24.095 --> 14:26.195
Your practice is all about

14:26.197 --> 14:29.231
portability and efficiency, is it not?

14:29.233 --> 14:31.533
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

14:31.535 --> 14:33.168
This is our sales brochure.

14:36.172 --> 14:37.172
Thank you.

14:41.011 --> 14:44.647
I mean, Europe does always
get the coolest gadgets first.

14:44.649 --> 14:45.881
Mr. Lawson,

14:45.883 --> 14:48.183
you're the C.F.O. Tell me...

14:48.185 --> 14:51.553
from a corporate
and strategic perspective,

14:51.555 --> 14:53.422
what do you think of this technology?

14:56.693 --> 14:59.728
I think it's awesome.

14:59.730 --> 15:03.132
Hank?

15:03.134 --> 15:04.233
What about you?

15:04.235 --> 15:10.005
I think it's worth discussing.

15:11.241 --> 15:13.642
We'll get back to you, Claudette.

15:13.644 --> 15:15.244
Yeah, uh, while we're here...

15:15.246 --> 15:16.645
thanks for your time.

15:34.590 --> 15:36.590
So that's the smart scale.

15:36.592 --> 15:38.325
Uh, she's also got a smart
band-aid that can

15:38.327 --> 15:40.361
monitor your vitals and even
call your doctor for you.

15:40.363 --> 15:43.464
And she's got a smart phone
that can double as a stethoscope

15:43.466 --> 15:44.865
and an ECG, it's insane.

15:44.867 --> 15:47.768
You see big opportunity, I can tell.

15:47.770 --> 15:49.070
How can you tell?

15:49.072 --> 15:51.739
Because when you get excited, you talk.

15:51.741 --> 15:53.974
And you're talking a lot right now.

15:56.779 --> 15:58.579
I guess I just wanna talk
about anything right now

15:58.581 --> 15:59.980
except you leaving.

15:59.982 --> 16:02.049
Yeah, I don't wanna say goodbye either.

16:02.051 --> 16:04.518
Come on. This job is gonna be

16:04.520 --> 16:05.786
a life-changing experience for you.

16:05.788 --> 16:07.788
Mm-mm. It'll be an experience.

16:07.790 --> 16:09.390
Evan, my life is perfect right now.

16:09.392 --> 16:10.725
I don't need it to change.

16:10.727 --> 16:14.228
You're scared.

16:14.230 --> 16:17.131
Paige.

16:17.133 --> 16:19.600
Is this your first real job? Like, ever?

16:19.602 --> 16:22.436
I dated an American idol.

16:22.438 --> 16:23.838
They paid us to show up at nightclubs.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.607
I wouldn't put that on your resume

16:26.609 --> 16:28.709
if I were you.

16:28.711 --> 16:32.947
Evan, I just... I've never had
to report to anyone before.

16:32.949 --> 16:34.915
You know, let alone
had anyone report to me.

16:34.917 --> 16:37.451
I've never had to navigate
workplace politics,

16:37.453 --> 16:39.687
and I've never had to make anyone happy

16:39.689 --> 16:41.021
that they hired me. I just... I...

16:41.023 --> 16:44.892
All you have to do
is trust your instincts.

16:44.894 --> 16:48.295
They're the reason you got this job.

16:48.297 --> 16:50.731
They're the reason
you're gonna crush this job.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.600
And they're the reason
you ended up with me.

16:52.602 --> 16:55.402
Instead of... Kris Allen?

16:55.404 --> 16:57.304
Let's not start naming idols.

16:57.306 --> 16:59.840
- He's the only one I know.
- Okay.

16:59.842 --> 17:02.943
- Besides Kelly and Ruben.
- Yeah.

17:02.945 --> 17:03.944
And Fantasia.

17:03.946 --> 17:06.446
And Carrie.

17:06.449 --> 17:08.415
And Taylor, Jordin,
David, Lee, and Scotty.

17:08.416 --> 17:12.752
You know. Them.

17:22.464 --> 17:26.066
Boys, they say to me it's a poison.

17:26.068 --> 17:27.667
- A poison?
- Yeah.

17:27.670 --> 17:30.805
From the o... o... oak.

17:37.279 --> 17:40.848
Oh. No.

17:40.850 --> 17:43.984
This isn't poison oak, Mrs. Sesumi.

17:43.986 --> 17:45.519
These are burns.

17:45.521 --> 17:47.621
Aren't they, brothers Sesumi?

17:47.623 --> 17:49.490
- Burn?
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.492 --> 17:53.160
How you boys burn? What you burn?

17:53.162 --> 17:54.595
Why you burn in house?

17:54.597 --> 17:55.996
Not in the house, grandma.

17:55.998 --> 17:58.299
Don't get hysterical. We were out back,

17:58.301 --> 18:00.367
- making our little movie.
- Yeah, guys, tell me again,

18:00.369 --> 18:02.770
what kind of little movie
are you making exactly?

18:02.772 --> 18:03.771
Romantic drama. Comedy.

18:03.773 --> 18:05.773
Musical.

18:05.775 --> 18:09.677
It's a romantic dramedy with music.

18:09.679 --> 18:12.680
Uh-huh. Okay.

18:12.682 --> 18:15.516
After I'm done with you,
I'd like a set visit, please.

18:22.457 --> 18:24.525
You're delayed?

18:24.527 --> 18:27.194
For how long?

18:27.196 --> 18:29.029
I miss you already.

18:29.031 --> 18:30.130
Feels like you've been gone forever.

18:30.132 --> 18:34.034
It's been... 131 minutes.

18:34.036 --> 18:35.536
Yeah.

18:37.038 --> 18:39.240
Paige, I'm gonna
call you right back, okay?

18:39.242 --> 18:41.542
Yeah. Bye.

18:43.511 --> 18:45.679
Hi, Claudette.

18:45.681 --> 18:47.414
And please come on in.

18:47.416 --> 18:48.782
I was just looking for a pen

18:48.784 --> 18:49.950
so I could leave you a note.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.354
- Okay.
- I wanted to follow up

18:53.356 --> 18:55.656
on our meeting,
see if you had any questions.

18:55.658 --> 18:57.992
None so far.

18:57.994 --> 18:59.560
And I also had a thought.

18:59.562 --> 19:01.729
What kind of thought?

19:01.731 --> 19:03.697
Maybe I could accompany you
on a house call.

19:03.699 --> 19:06.200
Oh, you wanna see Hankmed in action.

19:06.202 --> 19:08.035
The better I get to know your clientele,

19:08.037 --> 19:09.370
the better I can recommend products

19:09.372 --> 19:10.838
to help them, and help you.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.441
Okay, sure.

19:14.443 --> 19:15.809
Uh, we'll just find a good time...

19:15.811 --> 19:17.745
Let's say this afternoon, shall we?

19:17.747 --> 19:21.348
- This afternoon...
- I'm looking forward to it.

19:23.151 --> 19:27.688
Huh.

19:27.690 --> 19:30.724
So I'm guessing
you do really stupid stuff

19:30.726 --> 19:33.560
and film it, taking
full advantage of your grandma,

19:33.562 --> 19:35.996
who has no idea
what's going on back here.

19:35.998 --> 19:38.365
And that's how Bobby got
his tongue stuck in the bottle?

19:38.367 --> 19:40.367
No, he just didn't wanna share his drink.

19:40.369 --> 19:42.736
I only yelled "action" after it happened.

19:42.738 --> 19:44.838
Guys, I wanna see your movie.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.407
You and everyone else, hopefully,

19:46.409 --> 19:48.776
once we upload it on YouTube.

19:50.412 --> 19:52.413
I mean now, Devon.

20:07.095 --> 20:09.163
So what did you think?

20:09.165 --> 20:12.132
I think you're taking
some pretty big risks

20:12.134 --> 20:13.434
for your little movie.

20:13.436 --> 20:16.470
My dad built 100 cell phone
stores by taking risks.

20:16.472 --> 20:17.972
That's impressive.

20:17.974 --> 20:19.707
And if you like, as soon
as he gets back from safari,

20:19.709 --> 20:22.209
I can tell him all about
your attempts to take after him.

20:22.211 --> 20:25.012
You have no idea how lucky you are

20:25.014 --> 20:26.847
to walk away with only minor burns.

20:26.849 --> 20:29.149
And if you wanna put yourself
in harm's way,

20:29.151 --> 20:31.285
that's bad enough.

20:31.287 --> 20:33.187
You shouldn't be putting
your brothers there with you.

20:38.593 --> 20:41.362
Sorry, guys, time
to shut down production.

21:20.402 --> 21:23.670
Okay, Panky. What are
our three rules for teeing off?

21:23.672 --> 21:27.341
Okay, swing through the ball,
not to it. Through the ball.

21:27.343 --> 21:29.243
Keep the clubface square.

21:29.245 --> 21:33.080
And most important, breathe.

21:33.082 --> 21:36.083
Let's see it.

21:39.054 --> 21:40.821
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:40.823 --> 21:42.122
Zero out of three ain't bad.

21:43.259 --> 21:47.127
Panky, let's see it again, champ.

21:49.097 --> 21:53.133
What?

21:53.135 --> 21:55.202
I'm sorry. That's not professional.

21:55.204 --> 21:56.437
I just... you know what, Panky?

21:56.439 --> 21:57.805
You're just gonna have
to get used to being

21:57.807 --> 21:58.972
my abused little student,

21:58.974 --> 22:01.608
because you, my friend,
might just be a lifer.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.434
Okay, in and out.

22:17.436 --> 22:20.103
Again.

22:20.105 --> 22:23.039
All right, one more time.

22:23.041 --> 22:26.242
Good. This is my first time
doing a camp physical.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.644
My first time going to camp.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.079
And it's a very competitive camp.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.247
All chess camps
are competitive, aunt Jill.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.482
Okay. I'm gonna need you

22:32.484 --> 22:34.217
to fill that up for me, grand master.

22:34.219 --> 22:37.520
All right.

22:40.725 --> 22:43.593
So how are you doing?

22:43.595 --> 22:47.597
Hanging in there.

22:47.599 --> 22:51.768
It's not just the sadness, Hank.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.236
It's also the guilt.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.372
What do you feel guilty about?

22:55.374 --> 23:00.310
Well, I...

23:00.312 --> 23:05.115
I keep replaying the boat
over and over in my head,

23:05.117 --> 23:09.252
and the second I realized
how sick he was,

23:09.254 --> 23:13.590
why... why didn't I force him
back to shore?

23:13.592 --> 23:15.492
Jill, you got a hold of me
as soon as you could,

23:15.494 --> 23:17.727
which is the only reason
Nina and I were there waiting

23:17.729 --> 23:19.562
as soon as you docked.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.131
And then you got him rushed
to the hospital.

23:21.133 --> 23:26.102
There was nothing else you could've done.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.972
Thanks.

23:28.974 --> 23:32.008
So how are you doing?

23:32.010 --> 23:36.813
I'm, uh...

23:36.815 --> 23:38.114
Yeah.

23:38.116 --> 23:41.284
Yeah.

23:41.286 --> 23:43.386
It's not like losing
a patient in the E.R., is it?

23:43.388 --> 23:46.489
I never get the chance
to know those patients.

23:46.491 --> 23:49.292
Lucky for you.

23:49.294 --> 23:51.261
Yeah.

23:58.436 --> 24:01.371
Remind me again why she's here.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.239
To observe, that's all.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.208
You know, though, the patient
didn't have to agree to this.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.409
And neither did you,

24:06.411 --> 24:09.946
and then you remembered
that you owe me one.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.949
You said that I didn't owe you one.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.118
And I was wrong. It happens.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.420
Look, when my C.F.O. instincts
speak to me,

24:17.422 --> 24:19.255
I have to listen to them.

24:19.257 --> 24:20.890
What are they saying, exactly?

24:20.892 --> 24:22.358
They're saying that this could be

24:22.360 --> 24:24.027
a very lucrative opportunity for Hankmed.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.162
In fact, it's too bad you sold me

24:26.164 --> 24:28.231
all your shares in the company.

24:28.233 --> 24:31.034
I think we're about to go Google.

24:31.036 --> 24:33.403
So, Grace, how did it go last night

24:33.405 --> 24:35.672
- with the sleeping monitor?
- Fabulous.

24:35.674 --> 24:40.176
- Fabulous, really?
- Yep.

24:40.178 --> 24:44.247
The test was incomplete.

24:44.249 --> 24:47.016
Did you have trouble
attaching the device?

24:47.018 --> 24:51.020
No. But I did have trouble
sleeping with it.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.489
So by fabulous...

24:52.491 --> 24:53.990
I mean horrendous.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.026
We'll try again tonight.

24:57.028 --> 24:59.696
But this time, I'll be here
to monitor you myself.

25:02.867 --> 25:06.102
This is my company's smart shirt.

25:06.104 --> 25:09.606
Embedded within the fabric
are respiration sensors

25:09.608 --> 25:11.207
that measure the patient's
breathing patterns.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.510
- Very clever.
- Yeah.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.445
I'm dying to see how it works.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.546
Excellent.

25:19.383 --> 25:22.685
I'm sorry, I... you may
have taken me too literally.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.855
I assure you, it's just
a shirt with some wires.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.625
- It's 100% safe.
- Um...

25:28.627 --> 25:29.759
I'm sure it is.

25:33.464 --> 25:34.531
At least 90%.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.065
So, uh...

25:36.067 --> 25:37.867
how does it transmit?

25:37.869 --> 25:39.702
Just like your sleep monitor.

25:39.704 --> 25:43.273
But it's cordless,
and far more comfortable.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.208
Well, how long has it been in use?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.810
For three years
in five different markets.

25:47.812 --> 25:50.980
Ugh! Whoo!

25:50.982 --> 25:54.017
All righty.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.085
Oh, I like the <i>Flashdance</i> thing.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.955
Oh, this is...

25:58.957 --> 26:02.158
It's surprisingly cozy.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.761
This lets a medical professional

26:04.763 --> 26:07.764
download the data set for analysis.

26:09.233 --> 26:11.668
Well, it seems like great technology.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.837
But I couldn't just hand it off
to a patient.

26:14.839 --> 26:17.307
I'll need to find the right time
to discuss it with Hank.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.842
Yeah, yeah. I'll handle that.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.477
I'd also like to be there,

26:21.479 --> 26:23.613
uh, myself to monitor its use.

26:23.615 --> 26:26.983
Of course. I completely understand.

26:26.985 --> 26:30.720
I'll stop by tomorrow
to follow up on this.

26:30.722 --> 26:33.122
Thanks.

26:33.124 --> 26:35.491
I'll go call Grace.

26:40.965 --> 26:42.398
Hey.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.000
Hey.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.902
Why are you wearing a smart shirt?

26:45.904 --> 26:46.903
You know what this is?

26:46.905 --> 26:48.237
Yeah, I read about it recently.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.439
Sounds like great technology.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.808
- Yeah.
- So...

26:51.810 --> 26:54.577
I got a message from Divya
ripping into me

26:54.579 --> 26:55.845
for not following up with a patient.

26:55.847 --> 26:57.113
Grace Hay Adams?

26:57.115 --> 26:59.549
Yeah, she told me. Don't sweat it.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.651
I know follow-up
isn't really your strong suit.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.519
Well, that's what I came by to tell her.

27:03.521 --> 27:04.520
I did follow up.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.189
With Hank.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.490
I left him a message yesterday,

27:07.492 --> 27:10.026
I figured that, as her primary of record,

27:10.028 --> 27:12.562
- he would wanna call her.
- Oh.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.531
Yeah, absolutely.

27:15.533 --> 27:19.435
Uh, yesterday was a pretty
rough day for him, so...

27:19.437 --> 27:21.170
I appreciate you coming by
to let me know.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.306
I came by to let Divya know.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.741
Right, right.

27:24.743 --> 27:28.077
Uh, yeah, she's out on the patio.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.446
- Thanks, dude.
- Yeah.

27:30.448 --> 27:34.884
Huh.

27:38.722 --> 27:42.492
Hi, Mrs. Sesumi, you called again.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.528
I try make boys be more safer,

27:45.530 --> 27:49.632
but all they want is, uh,
shoot, shoot, shoot movies.

27:49.634 --> 27:51.968
And, uh, and shoot self.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.904
And with now big wheels.

27:54.906 --> 27:57.440
I worry.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.610
Mrs. Sesumi, your grandsons
are very stubborn.

28:00.612 --> 28:01.811
I wish there was something I could do,

28:01.813 --> 28:03.413
but I... I just...
I don't know what that is.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.381
Please, doctor.

28:06.550 --> 28:09.886
My only family.

28:09.888 --> 28:12.388
Okay, okay.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.691
Let me... let me see what I can do.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.361
Uh, when you said "big wheels"...

28:24.968 --> 28:27.136
Devon, stop!

28:29.106 --> 28:30.740
No, Devon!

28:30.742 --> 28:33.042
Whoa! Whoo!

28:33.044 --> 28:34.510
This is awesome!

28:34.512 --> 28:37.480
Yahoo!

28:38.982 --> 28:42.251
Aw, cool! Whoo!

28:44.188 --> 28:47.557
- Devon!
- Devon!

28:47.559 --> 28:50.793
Devon! Devon!

28:50.795 --> 28:53.229
Not responsive. Okay.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.797
We need to logroll him.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.432
Here, you get your hands
under his body there.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.568
You get your hands
under his leg. On three.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.271
One, two, three. Roll...

29:02.273 --> 29:03.840
That's it.

29:03.842 --> 29:06.509
Easy. Okay.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.911
Good.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.247
Okay, Devon...

29:11.249 --> 29:13.516
Okay, Devon, you need to lie still.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.384
Okay. Do you have pain anywhere?

29:16.654 --> 29:18.154
Guys, I need you to grab me

29:18.156 --> 29:19.255
those bungee cords and a surfboard.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.790
Are you gonna do a stunt for us?

29:20.792 --> 29:23.893
No, I'm gonna stabilize
Devon's spine. Go!

29:23.895 --> 29:25.962
Okay, Devon, can you feel this?

29:25.964 --> 29:28.498
Yes. Can you feel this?

29:28.500 --> 29:31.200
Okay, can you move your hands and feet?

29:31.202 --> 29:32.368
Can I get up now?

29:32.370 --> 29:34.103
No, Devon, you have to relax.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.171
But I think I know what went wrong.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.639
I gotta try it again.

29:36.641 --> 29:38.608
Devon, you could've severely
injured your spinal cord,

29:38.610 --> 29:40.309
and that could mean permanent paralysis.

29:40.311 --> 29:42.545
As in no more stunts or walking ever.

29:42.547 --> 29:43.780
You need to stop this now.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.748
Doc, I'll be more careful this time.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.016
This isn't a negotiation.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.584
I'm the doctor, and you're the patient.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.419
- But I wanna...
- No! No more buts.

29:50.421 --> 29:51.954
You have to listen to me, Jack.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.623
Who?

30:18.707 --> 30:21.008
Was the smart shirt uncomfortable?

30:21.010 --> 30:23.010
Actually, it was surprisingly cozy,

30:23.012 --> 30:25.880
and a very slimming color.

30:25.882 --> 30:27.214
So then...

30:27.216 --> 30:29.683
I have to video chat
with a client in Sydney.

30:34.389 --> 30:38.893
How do you manage it?

30:38.895 --> 30:44.398
Keeping all those plates
spinning 'round the world?

30:44.400 --> 30:48.803
After my car accident...

30:48.805 --> 30:49.970
I was told that I would never

30:49.972 --> 30:52.039
be able to walk down a runway again.

30:52.041 --> 30:56.410
I thought my career was over.

30:56.412 --> 31:00.948
Hearing that was more painful
than the crash itself.

31:00.950 --> 31:03.551
I hated that pain.

31:03.553 --> 31:06.887
And, being hyper-competitive,
I needed to beat that pain.

31:06.889 --> 31:10.224
I had expertise to offer,

31:10.226 --> 31:12.326
so I applied for jobs.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.894
But I had to compete against people

31:13.896 --> 31:17.264
who didn't need ramps
built just for them.

31:17.266 --> 31:20.134
So I went to work for myself.

31:20.136 --> 31:22.770
And for the first time in my life,

31:22.772 --> 31:26.040
I became truly independent.

31:26.042 --> 31:28.709
I know. I know it sounds crazy.

31:28.711 --> 31:31.946
No, not at all.

31:31.948 --> 31:35.316
I guess sometimes you find
strength and independence

31:35.318 --> 31:37.151
in the last place you want to look.

31:41.289 --> 31:45.326
According to your newest
fashion statement,

31:45.328 --> 31:48.329
you do indeed suffer from sleep apnea.

31:48.331 --> 31:52.533
Look, the results are measured
in apneic spells per hour.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.802
How often you stopped breathing.

31:54.804 --> 31:58.239
Anything over five times an hour
is considered abnormal.

31:58.241 --> 32:00.774
You averaged 20 times.

32:00.776 --> 32:03.077
I don't remember waking up
that many times.

32:03.079 --> 32:05.279
Because of your deviated septum,

32:05.281 --> 32:08.382
not enough oxygenated blood
is getting into your heart.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.717
Can we fix it?

32:09.719 --> 32:11.852
Mm-hmm. Luckily, a rhinoplasty

32:11.854 --> 32:13.454
can correct the deviated septum,

32:13.456 --> 32:16.624
and help prevent the nocturnal angina.

32:16.626 --> 32:20.261
What are the odds anyone
in my business will believe

32:20.263 --> 32:22.296
I got a nose job for medical reasons?

32:28.771 --> 32:31.071
Hey.

32:31.073 --> 32:33.040
Hey.

32:33.042 --> 32:34.441
You're here early.

32:34.443 --> 32:36.177
Uh, yeah, I was in the E.R. all night

32:36.179 --> 32:39.446
waiting to run tests
on a teenage patient.

32:39.448 --> 32:43.484
Lucky for him, he's almost
as indestructible as he thinks.

32:43.486 --> 32:46.020
Good. I think.

32:46.022 --> 32:47.922
Uh, yeah. He's... he's fine.

32:47.924 --> 32:51.425
But...

32:51.427 --> 32:54.461
it's not why you're here, is it?

32:54.463 --> 32:59.600
No, it's not.

32:59.602 --> 33:03.737
How are you, Hank?

33:03.739 --> 33:09.243
I'm pissed.

33:09.245 --> 33:12.112
At him.

33:12.114 --> 33:13.314
So pissed.

33:13.316 --> 33:16.650
For...

33:16.652 --> 33:21.288
going fishing instead
of getting his dialysis.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.524
For...

33:23.526 --> 33:27.828
for not listening to me.

33:27.830 --> 33:32.733
But mostly...

33:32.735 --> 33:34.802
just for dying.

33:34.804 --> 33:37.104
He was an infuriating patient.

33:37.106 --> 33:41.875
- Yeah, yeah, he was.
- But to you, he...

33:41.877 --> 33:44.578
he wasn't just a patient.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.347
You lost a friend, Hank.

33:46.349 --> 33:49.817
Yeah. The, uh...

33:51.653 --> 33:54.255
the downside of concierge medicine.

33:58.159 --> 34:01.061
He was my friend.

34:07.402 --> 34:10.437
I just miss him, you know?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.741
I miss him.

34:13.743 --> 34:15.309
Me too.

34:17.045 --> 34:19.647
Remember when you brought him
to my office for the first time?

34:19.649 --> 34:23.417
Yeah, when we gave him
his treatment options.

34:23.418 --> 34:25.018
Whoa, what was Tom Bosley like?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.954
Was Bosley all hands? Was he like...

34:26.956 --> 34:28.188
- was he like...
- Come on, Jack.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.456
This is serious.

34:29.458 --> 34:30.958
I mean, we can lay out your options,

34:30.960 --> 34:33.460
but at the end of the day,
it's your decision.

34:38.065 --> 34:41.635
So what you're saying is,
they both have risks, so...

34:41.637 --> 34:43.837
I might as well flip a coin.

34:43.839 --> 34:45.906
Uh, that's actually not
what we're saying.

34:52.447 --> 34:54.248
Who wants to call it?

34:55.850 --> 34:57.618
Sorry, but I have an issue

34:57.620 --> 34:59.953
with making major life decisions
by coin toss.

34:59.955 --> 35:02.589
- I share his issue.
- Yeah.

35:02.591 --> 35:05.092
Come on, guys. Everything in life

35:05.094 --> 35:07.194
is a 50/50 proposition.

35:07.196 --> 35:10.798
Either it happens or it doesn't.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.333
Why not leave it to a coin toss?

35:12.335 --> 35:13.801
Yeah, no, sure. And for
anything more complicated,

35:13.803 --> 35:15.402
we can just bust out the magic 8-ball.

35:19.507 --> 35:23.510
Come on, Panky. I... look...

35:23.512 --> 35:25.813
Serious things,

35:25.815 --> 35:29.183
they don't always have to be serious.

35:29.185 --> 35:32.953
Even a half-robot, half-alien knows that.

35:39.027 --> 35:43.130
I never did get to confess to him.

35:43.132 --> 35:47.267
Con... confess?

35:47.269 --> 35:48.569
Uh, yeah.

35:48.571 --> 35:52.840
That, uh... I was the child actress

35:52.842 --> 35:54.842
in that ridiculous little sitcom.

35:56.178 --> 35:57.411
- Really?
- Yes.

35:57.413 --> 35:59.079
Yeah, I know.

35:59.081 --> 36:00.748
I know. He had me pegged from the start.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.016
Yeah, he did.

36:03.018 --> 36:05.185
But he really wanted
to hear me admit it, didn't he?

36:05.187 --> 36:09.056
- Almost more than anything.
- Mm-hmm.

36:09.058 --> 36:13.560
I think I just figured out
a way to make it up to him.

36:13.562 --> 36:19.066
Just because he didn't want us
to mourn his death,

36:19.068 --> 36:21.602
doesn't mean we can't celebrate his life.

36:29.644 --> 36:30.677
Here we go.

36:36.451 --> 36:39.620
Okay.

36:39.622 --> 36:41.889
This one's for Jack.

36:47.695 --> 36:48.996
You hit it fat, Panky.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.165
- I did indeed.
- Mm, yeah.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.534
I think Jack would've wanted you
to have a mulligan.

36:55.537 --> 37:00.240
So about Claudette's smart shirt.

37:00.242 --> 37:01.575
Please tell me
it didn't kill the patient.

37:01.577 --> 37:04.511
It diagnosed her. And rather brilliantly.

37:04.513 --> 37:05.846
I knew it would.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.514
That's why I got three more from her.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.016
I have them in the van.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.584
In case we stumble upon an apnea epidemic

37:10.586 --> 37:11.618
on the back nine.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.086
You never know.

37:13.088 --> 37:15.656
And I've just begun browsing
Claudette's catalogue too.

37:15.658 --> 37:19.126
Well, you were right
to trust your instincts, Evan.

37:19.128 --> 37:20.461
I'm proud of you.

37:20.463 --> 37:23.697
Okay, uh, Divya...

37:23.699 --> 37:25.899
please. You have to stop

37:25.901 --> 37:27.100
- being nice to me.
- Hey, what are you guys

37:27.102 --> 37:28.769
yapping about over there?

37:28.771 --> 37:30.237
Uh, sorry, Divya was hitting on me.

37:30.239 --> 37:32.973
It was very awkward for everyone.

37:32.975 --> 37:36.710
Yeah, speaking of awkward,

37:36.712 --> 37:38.178
remember that time that Jack
stopped by the guest house

37:38.180 --> 37:39.546
when I was trying to break up with you?

37:39.548 --> 37:41.448
Yeah. That was some good times.

37:41.450 --> 37:43.684
Jack was the...

37:43.686 --> 37:46.787
uninvited guest
you never wanted to see go.

37:46.789 --> 37:48.021
The opposite of Evan.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.692
She's back.

37:54.929 --> 37:58.131
Okay.

38:01.035 --> 38:04.271
This one's really for Jack.

38:05.940 --> 38:11.378
And most important...

38:11.380 --> 38:13.046
breathe.

38:53.573 --> 38:58.076
So...

38:58.078 --> 38:59.644
how old was he anyway?

38:59.646 --> 39:01.012
He was 40.

39:01.014 --> 39:03.148
40.

39:03.150 --> 39:06.518
Maybe that's why
this was so hard for you.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.286
Ev, this was nothing like that.

39:08.288 --> 39:10.288
- She was the perfect patient.
- No, I remember...

39:10.290 --> 39:12.357
And what happened to her
was totally beyond her control.

39:12.359 --> 39:14.192
I remember that too.
I'm not... I'm not comparing

39:14.194 --> 39:17.095
Jack to mom, I'm just saying...

39:17.097 --> 39:19.397
you know, it's gotta bring back
some painful memories.

39:19.399 --> 39:23.168
Right? It was the last time
either of us lost someone

39:23.170 --> 39:24.969
- that we really cared about...
- Ev, I... I really don't feel

39:24.971 --> 39:27.071
like being psychoanalyzed
right now, please.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.908
All right.

39:33.379 --> 39:36.114
What are those?

39:38.284 --> 39:41.586
Um, those are smart shirts.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.654
They diagnose sleep apnea.

39:42.656 --> 39:43.655
Yeah, no, I know what they do.

39:43.657 --> 39:44.889
I read Claudette's brochure.

39:44.891 --> 39:46.357
Why do you have three
of them in the trunk?

39:46.359 --> 39:49.027
Because after the successful
test on Grace Hay Adams,

39:49.029 --> 39:50.795
I figured I'd stock up.

39:50.797 --> 39:51.796
Wait, wait, I'm... I'm sorry.

39:51.798 --> 39:54.465
You used this on a patient?

39:54.467 --> 39:56.100
- Divya would never agree to use...
- Don't blame Divya.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.335
I told her I was gonna
talk to you about it,

39:57.337 --> 39:58.837
and then I didn't,

39:58.839 --> 40:01.139
because I... I was... I wanted to
give you some space, that's all.

40:01.141 --> 40:02.674
But I'm not an idiot.

40:02.676 --> 40:05.143
I researched the hell out of it
to make sure it was safe,

40:05.145 --> 40:07.045
and Hank, it works.

40:07.047 --> 40:08.746
That's not the point.

40:08.748 --> 40:10.882
You used a... a new device on a patient

40:10.884 --> 40:12.450
without consulting me.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.785
If I consulted you, you would've said no.

40:13.787 --> 40:14.953
Yeah, you're right, I would have,

40:14.955 --> 40:16.087
because we run a medical practice,

40:16.089 --> 40:17.789
not a Sharper Image franchise.

40:17.791 --> 40:21.893
Okay. I think this
is something we have to pursue.

40:21.895 --> 40:24.562
As a company. We... we...
in fact, I know it is.

40:24.564 --> 40:27.165
It's... it's... Hank...

40:27.167 --> 40:29.701
when we settled out here,
you had nothing to lose.

40:29.703 --> 40:31.202
I gave up a lot.

40:31.204 --> 40:33.671
I... I gave up my job,
I gave up my life, basically,

40:33.673 --> 40:34.839
because I believed in you.

40:34.841 --> 40:36.875
I believed in my brother.

40:36.877 --> 40:39.711
When's it gonna be your turn, huh?

40:39.713 --> 40:41.579
To believe in me, even a little bit?

40:41.581 --> 40:43.381
Evan, I am done fighting with you

40:43.383 --> 40:44.749
about the expansion of Hankmed,

40:44.751 --> 40:46.484
and not just 'cause your timing sucks.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.720
Sorry to remind you,
but I have the letters M.D.,

40:48.722 --> 40:51.022
so I'm in charge.

40:51.024 --> 40:53.958
- Great.
- Great.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.961
Wait a minute.

40:56.963 --> 40:58.263
So there's something else

40:58.265 --> 41:00.431
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

41:00.433 --> 41:02.267
Divya needed some money

41:02.269 --> 41:05.203
so I bought her shares in Hankmed.

41:05.205 --> 41:07.372
Which means I now own 2/3 of the company.

41:07.374 --> 41:10.041
- What?
- Yeah.

41:10.043 --> 41:12.844
So now that I think about it,

41:12.846 --> 41:17.181
I'm in charge.

41:17.183 --> 41:20.084
Well, you're about to increase
your ownership even further.

41:20.086 --> 41:21.786
You can have my third too.

41:21.788 --> 41:24.555
But you may wanna change
the name of the company.

41:24.557 --> 41:27.492
I quit.

41:27.494 --> 41:30.929
Good.

42:04.463 --> 42:05.463
Hank.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.133
Evan.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.035
You wanna talk about Jack some more?

42:11.037 --> 42:13.004
Is Hankmed here to rip into me again?

42:13.006 --> 42:15.506
Not exactly.

42:15.508 --> 42:18.176
I want to talk about a job.
