15:55.083 --> 15:56.666
<i>and he loved her the whole way.</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:00.250
<i>I am told, and I believe,</i>

16:01.000 --> 16:02.291
<i>that he loves her still.</i>

16:08.500 --> 16:10.958
-[knocking on door]
-[Jamie] You about done up here?

16:16.083 --> 16:17.083
I got distracted.

16:18.541 --> 16:20.541
[Jamie] That's all right. I'll help you.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.208
What's wrong?

16:30.083 --> 16:31.708
[breathes shakily] I don't know.

16:33.791 --> 16:34.625
Dani.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.291
[sobs softly] I feel her.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.166
In here.

16:47.875 --> 16:50.541
It's so quiet, it's so quiet, but…

16:53.791 --> 16:54.875
she's in here.

16:58.791 --> 16:59.708
And this…

17:03.791 --> 17:04.708
part of her…

17:07.166 --> 17:08.583
that's in here, it isn't…

17:14.500 --> 17:15.333
peaceful.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.333
It's quiet, but…

17:23.208 --> 17:24.041
it isn't…

17:26.791 --> 17:27.958
peaceful. It's…

17:29.625 --> 17:30.500
rage.

17:31.375 --> 17:34.208
And I have this feeling
like I'm walking through this…

17:34.833 --> 17:35.666
dense…

17:36.708 --> 17:37.791
overgrown…

17:39.041 --> 17:40.000
jungle…

17:40.666 --> 17:43.791
and I can't really see anything
except the path in front of me.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.125
But I know…

17:46.083 --> 17:47.041
there's this…

17:48.458 --> 17:49.291
thing…

17:51.041 --> 17:51.916
hidden.

17:53.208 --> 17:57.750
This angry, empty, lonely beast.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.416
It's watching me.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.000
[melancholy music playing]

18:01.708 --> 18:03.416
Matching my movements.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.208
It's just out of sight…

18:06.958 --> 18:08.166
but I can feel it.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.333
I know it's there.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.458
And it's waiting.

18:17.916 --> 18:19.333
[ominous music plays softly]

18:19.416 --> 18:20.291
She's waiting.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.250
<i>And at some point…</i>

18:25.625 --> 18:26.875
she's gonna take me.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.750
[breathes shakily]

18:49.750 --> 18:50.750
Do you want company?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.500
While you wait
for your beast in the jungle?

18:55.583 --> 18:56.416
[Dani sniffles]

18:56.500 --> 18:57.500
Do you want company?

18:57.583 --> 18:58.458
[Dani sighs]

19:02.000 --> 19:04.541
[sniffles, sighs heavily]

19:16.000 --> 19:17.458
[Flora] <i>Will you visit us?</i>

19:19.000 --> 19:20.500
Depends on where you're going.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.791
Uh, America, I think.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.583
Well…

19:27.416 --> 19:28.541
I can do that.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.708
I think that's where we're, uh…
where we're gonna go.

19:33.208 --> 19:36.416
First, for a little while, at least.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.041
Then where?

19:40.458 --> 19:43.625
Well, uh…
that's the thing about adventures,

19:43.708 --> 19:44.958
you're not meant to know.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.958
-[whispers] That's half the fun.
-[all chuckle]

19:50.708 --> 19:51.833
For you.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.916
[tender music playing]

19:59.458 --> 20:02.416
-Are you sure you wanna give me this one?
-You must have it.

20:03.916 --> 20:04.750
It's you.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.500
Thank you, Flora.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.541
Well, uh, good show, boss.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.333
[chuckles] Take care.

20:18.416 --> 20:19.333
-Yeah.
-Be safe.

20:22.875 --> 20:23.708
Oh, well…

20:25.541 --> 20:26.791
I suppose I…

20:27.500 --> 20:29.541
I don't know how I will ever thank you.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.041
[sighs]

20:43.000 --> 20:44.208
I'm so glad.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.166
You have each other now.

20:48.541 --> 20:49.500
I know. [chuckles]

20:51.791 --> 20:52.958
It is right.

20:55.458 --> 20:56.416
I…

20:58.625 --> 21:01.125
Well, I'm just so goddamned lucky,
aren't I?

21:01.833 --> 21:04.208
And so are you, Miss Clayton.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.083
Where would we be, we wretched people…

21:09.458 --> 21:11.500
without the generosity of our betters?

21:13.125 --> 21:13.958
And luck.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.833
[exhales loudly]

21:24.916 --> 21:26.083
You all right, Poppins?

21:27.541 --> 21:28.375
Yeah.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.166
[engine turns over]

21:55.875 --> 21:58.500
[Jamie] If we keep driving north,
it looks pretty rural.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.708
There's lots of green.

22:01.541 --> 22:03.500
Maybe in a few weeks
we could take the train.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.208
Get to Vermont around Christmas.

22:05.750 --> 22:06.625
[Dani] Mm.

22:07.375 --> 22:08.375
Snow could be nice.

22:11.166 --> 22:13.291
You'll laugh, but, uh…

22:13.916 --> 22:17.416
part of me's wanted to go since I saw
<i>White Christmas</i> when I was a kid.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.333
[chuckles]

22:22.333 --> 22:24.750
-Doesn't have to be Vermont.
-No, it's not that.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.625
Snow sounds nice.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.041
I just…

22:29.166 --> 22:31.166
I don't think we should plan,
you know, Christmas.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.375
It's a ways away.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.416
One day at a time.

22:34.916 --> 22:37.625
Yeah, no, I know. I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just…

22:38.875 --> 22:40.166
-Just being--
-Realistic?

22:41.750 --> 22:42.583
It's all right.

22:44.416 --> 22:46.083
One day at a time is fine by me.

22:47.791 --> 22:49.791
As long as those days
are with you, Poppins.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.291
One day at a time is what we've got.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.375
It's what everybody's got
when you get down to it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.333
I've got a problem.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.625
Or rather, we've got a problem, Poppins.

23:40.208 --> 23:41.250
Oh, no.

You see…

23:43.416 --> 23:44.458
I'm not sick of you.

23:46.125 --> 23:46.958
At all.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.875
I'm actually pretty in love with you,

How many years in this kitchen?
My cooking is still shite.

-Found it on the street.

25:29.291 --> 25:30.375
Wanted to save it.

Give it here, then.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.250
Want me to keep stirring?

25:42.125 --> 25:43.958
Yeah, see if you can salvage it.

26:08.416 --> 26:09.708
You're my best friend.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.416
And I love my life.

26:14.125 --> 26:16.125
And I don't know
how much time we have left,

26:17.458 --> 26:18.708
but however much it is,

26:19.833 --> 26:21.166
I wanna spend it with you.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.916
And I know
we can't technically get married,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.666
but I also don't really care.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.750
We can wear the rings, and we'll know.

26:30.333 --> 26:31.708
Okay? And…

26:33.000 --> 26:34.083
that's enough for me.

26:35.416 --> 26:36.583
If it's enough for you.

26:38.541 --> 26:41.375
I reckon that's enough for me, yeah.

I'm so happy for you both.

-Cheers, mate.
-Thank you.

27:23.541 --> 27:25.958
Owen, this place is so beautiful.

27:26.041 --> 27:27.208
Thank you.

27:27.291 --> 27:28.166
Yeah, I'm, uh…

27:28.916 --> 27:30.208
I'm happy with it.

27:30.291 --> 27:33.250
We have a lot of regulars now,
which is nice.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.958
They'll come in,
and I'll have their order ready.

27:36.541 --> 27:38.750
There's something in knowing you, uh…

people like to come back to.

27:40.666 --> 27:41.750
-Yeah.
-Nice.

27:41.833 --> 27:42.750
[Owen] Yeah.

27:42.833 --> 27:45.666
And no one's, uh, lodged
any complaints about the name?

27:47.333 --> 27:48.416
-Okay.
-[Jamie laughs]

27:48.500 --> 27:51.166
Okay, it does get the occasional eye roll.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.916
But I'll never forget

27:53.000 --> 27:56.333
how badly it annoyed her
until she finally had to laugh,

27:56.416 --> 27:59.500
and nothing was better
than that woman's laugh.

28:00.541 --> 28:01.375
Yeah.

28:02.916 --> 28:03.750
To Hannah.

28:04.458 --> 28:05.291
To Hannah.

28:07.416 --> 28:08.250
Hannah.

28:11.625 --> 28:12.458
[Owen] Mm.

28:12.541 --> 28:14.750
-[Dani] Mm.
-You heard from Henry recently?

28:15.250 --> 28:17.541
-Uh, I check in every now and again.
<i>-Merci.</i>

28:17.625 --> 28:20.083
We haven't spoken to the kids
in ages, though.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.625
-[ominous rumble]
-But, hey, they are growing up

28:22.708 --> 28:24.291
and getting out into the world.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.791
What kid wants to chat
to a couple of old people, eh?

28:28.791 --> 28:30.125
-[melancholy music]
-You all right?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.500
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

28:32.416 --> 28:35.041
I, uh, try to go when I can, you know.

28:35.125 --> 28:39.500
Actually, uh, they all came here
a few months back, on holiday.

28:39.583 --> 28:41.458
Back across the pond on an adventure.

28:42.041 --> 28:43.750
Henry, Miles, Flora.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.541
Flora's boyfriend.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.500
Flora's got a boyfriend?

28:48.916 --> 28:50.041
She's 12.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.041
[Owen] She's 17.

28:52.041 --> 28:53.166
-Yeah.
-Christ.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.583
And fully smitten.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.958
Henry is terrified.

28:57.041 --> 29:00.291
Thank God he's sober now,
or he'd drink himself into a grave.

29:01.708 --> 29:02.833
So, they're all happy?

29:04.041 --> 29:04.875
Yeah.

29:07.000 --> 29:07.833
[Dani] Mm.

29:07.916 --> 29:10.791
It's interesting, though.
The way they talk about Bly.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.625
You talked about what happened?

29:14.791 --> 29:16.708
No. I mean, that's what's interesting.

29:18.083 --> 29:20.083
They don't remember anything about it.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.166
What?

29:21.250 --> 29:22.333
Nothing?

29:23.041 --> 29:25.875
No. Well, just the kids. Henry still…

29:27.458 --> 29:28.541
remembers all of it.

29:28.625 --> 29:29.958
But I mentioned Hannah,

29:30.041 --> 29:32.583
and Flora asked me
who I was talking about.

29:34.166 --> 29:36.625
-It's been this way a while, turns out.
-[Dani] So…

29:37.875 --> 29:41.083
Well, if they don't remember Hannah,
they don't remember…

29:42.250 --> 29:44.375
So, they've just forgotten it all?

29:44.458 --> 29:47.541
They know they used to stay at Bly
when they were children.

29:47.625 --> 29:50.000
Said they recognized Hannah's picture,

29:50.083 --> 29:52.625
but only as the woman
that used to stay there with them.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.333
The details, the specific moments, the…

29:58.208 --> 29:59.166
the fear of it all

29:59.250 --> 30:02.166
that we were so afraid would infect
the rest of their lives has just…

30:03.750 --> 30:04.791
faded away.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.416
And all that's left is the shape of it.

30:08.041 --> 30:09.500
Bly was their summer home.

30:11.041 --> 30:13.166
They used to live there
when they were children.

30:15.250 --> 30:16.458
Do you think Henry will…

30:17.500 --> 30:18.333
tell them?

30:19.541 --> 30:20.375
Would you?

30:22.625 --> 30:24.541
I mean, by the signs of it,
they're thriving.

30:24.625 --> 30:25.625
I'd say…

30:26.375 --> 30:27.583
just let them be.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.375
Let them live their lives
the way they should.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.208
Without anything hanging over them.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.000
They deserve that.

30:37.833 --> 30:38.750
We all do.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.208
[water running]

30:47.458 --> 30:48.583
Are we gonna talk?

30:55.208 --> 30:56.458
I'll take that as a "no."

31:02.458 --> 31:03.458
[ominous crescendo]

31:04.500 --> 31:06.166
-[dish crashes]
-Jesus!

31:07.666 --> 31:08.666
What's going on?

31:08.750 --> 31:10.750
-Are you okay?
-[breathing shakily]

31:11.416 --> 31:12.458
What happened?

31:12.541 --> 31:14.208
I saw… I saw her.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.333
She's there.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.375
What did you see?

31:21.625 --> 31:22.458
Her.

31:23.666 --> 31:24.541
[gasps]

31:25.125 --> 31:27.000
[whispering] I keep seeing her.

31:27.625 --> 31:28.458
Okay.

31:29.375 --> 31:30.916
-Right.
-[faucet squeaks off]

31:31.583 --> 31:32.666
[water gurgling]

31:34.041 --> 31:34.875
Okay.

31:36.041 --> 31:37.416
-It's gone.
-It's gone?

31:37.958 --> 31:39.291
-Is it?
-It's okay.

31:40.083 --> 31:41.250
We're gonna be okay.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.041
-You can't think the worst.
-Jamie.

31:43.125 --> 31:45.916
-We don't know what this means. We…
-Jamie.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.083
We can have so many more years together.

31:48.833 --> 31:49.666
Dani.

31:50.166 --> 31:51.916
We can have so many more years.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.458
We'll keep an eye on it,
and it'll be fine.

31:54.541 --> 31:56.125
[panting]

31:56.208 --> 31:57.041
Okay?

31:58.375 --> 31:59.625
It's gonna be okay.

32:00.625 --> 32:02.125
It's gonna be okay.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.666
I'll do the washing up from now on.

32:05.583 --> 32:06.416
Yeah?

32:07.791 --> 32:09.250
You're shit at it, anyway.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.166
[Dani chuckles]

32:10.708 --> 32:12.291
-[sniffles]
-[chuckles]

32:13.291 --> 32:14.500
Oh, baby, come here.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.125
[kiss]

32:16.208 --> 32:17.041
It's okay.

32:20.083 --> 32:20.958
It's okay.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.291
It's gonna be okay.

32:27.666 --> 32:30.208
Well, the queue was shite,
but I've got it.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.416
Our union is officially civil.

32:36.625 --> 32:38.250
We'll marry again when we can.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.750
-[water gurgling]
-It looks like that's enough for now.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.333
Dani.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.083
Dani?

32:51.166 --> 32:53.166
[ominous music playing]

32:56.708 --> 32:58.875
-[faucet squeaks off]
-Dani. Dani.

32:58.958 --> 32:59.791
[gasps shakily]

32:59.875 --> 33:00.791
Dani.

33:00.875 --> 33:02.333
It's okay. It's okay.

33:03.291 --> 33:04.125
It's okay.

33:06.125 --> 33:06.958
Okay.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.291
[whispers] Do you see her?

33:13.458 --> 33:14.500
I only see you.

33:17.625 --> 33:18.458
I'm sorry.

33:18.541 --> 33:21.500
-All the water, I didn't realize.
-It's okay. It's okay.

33:22.541 --> 33:24.250
Water is easy to clean up.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.166
[sniffles]

33:27.833 --> 33:29.958
I'm so tired, Jamie.

33:31.791 --> 33:32.625
I know.

33:35.875 --> 33:36.916
I know.

33:39.916 --> 33:42.583
It's like every day
I feel myself fading away,

33:42.666 --> 33:44.250
but I'm still here, and…

33:44.333 --> 33:45.375
Hey.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.666
-I don't really understand how that is.
-You're still here.

33:49.875 --> 33:50.791
You're here.

33:53.791 --> 33:55.833
It's like I see you right in front of me…

33:57.708 --> 33:59.291
and I feel you touching me…

34:02.208 --> 34:03.708
and every day…

34:03.791 --> 34:06.416
-[melancholy music playing]
-…we're living our lives,

34:07.416 --> 34:08.583
and I'm aware of that…

34:09.750 --> 34:11.916
and it's like I don't feel it all the way.

34:12.625 --> 34:15.333
I'm not even scared of her anymore.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.875
I just stare at her, and…

34:23.666 --> 34:26.458
it's getting harder and harder to see me.

34:30.958 --> 34:33.083
Maybe I should just accept that.

34:33.625 --> 34:38.041
-No… No, no.
-Maybe I should just accept that and go.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.541
No.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.000
Not yet.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.791
-Jamie…
-Look, it's fine.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.625
If you can't feel anything…

34:50.333 --> 34:52.541
then I'll feel everything
for the both of us.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.875
But no one is going anywhere.

34:59.041 --> 34:59.875
Okay?

35:01.958 --> 35:03.791
You're still here.

35:05.708 --> 35:06.708
[sobs softly]

35:09.750 --> 35:10.875
What if…

35:10.958 --> 35:11.916
[sobbing]

35:12.000 --> 35:15.333
…I'm here sitting next to you…

35:18.875 --> 35:20.500
but I'm just really her?

35:24.750 --> 35:25.791
One day at a time.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.416
[rain pattering]

35:32.166 --> 35:34.166
[ominous music slowly building]

35:44.583 --> 35:46.083
[water gurgling]

35:47.958 --> 35:50.208
[music intensifying]

35:51.333 --> 35:52.541
[fades to silence]

35:54.125 --> 35:56.125
[melancholy music playing]

35:57.666 --> 35:58.625
[breathing rapidly]

36:30.291 --> 36:32.791
[storyteller]
<i>The au pair knew the moment had come.</i>

36:33.625 --> 36:37.541
<i>The beast had lurked indeed,</i>
<i>and the beast, at its hour, had sprung.</i>

36:40.291 --> 36:42.666
<i>And she could not risk</i>
<i>the most important thing,</i>

36:43.166 --> 36:44.750
<i>her most important person.</i>

36:45.458 --> 36:47.125
-[sniffles]
<i>-Not for one more day.</i>

36:53.166 --> 36:58.333
<i>And so, the gardener found herself</i>
<i>back at Bly Manor one last time.</i>

36:59.625 --> 37:00.833
[birds chirping]

37:36.625 --> 37:38.625
[music building emotionally]

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
[sighs heavily]

37:50.500 --> 37:51.416

[water splashing]

38:18.000 --> 38:21.458
[storyteller] <i>The gardener said the words</i>
<i>she'd heard those years ago.</i>

38:21.958 --> 38:24.458
<i>-She willed it with everything she had.</i>
<i>-</i>[muffled screams]

38:24.958 --> 38:27.500
<i>You, me, us.</i>

38:28.125 --> 38:28.958
<i>Us.</i>

38:29.500 --> 38:31.625
<i>"Take me with you,"</i>
<i>she cried in her heart.</i>

38:31.708 --> 38:34.250
<i>"Take me.</i>
<i>Drag me down like you did the others."</i>

38:35.125 --> 38:37.125
<i>But the lady in the lake</i>
<i>was different now.</i>

38:37.208 --> 38:38.708
[muffled screams]

38:38.791 --> 38:40.541
<i>The lady in the lake was also Dani.</i>

38:41.375 --> 38:42.375
<i>And Dani wouldn't.</i>

38:43.291 --> 38:44.416
<i>Dani would never.</i>

38:47.000 --> 38:49.958
<i>In fact, no one would ever be taken again.</i>

38:50.625 --> 38:52.833
<i>And no one has been taken to this day.</i>

38:53.500 --> 38:54.916
[gasps, screams]

38:59.166 --> 39:00.500
[whimpering]

39:02.583 --> 39:04.791
[panting]

39:24.916 --> 39:28.791
[storyteller] <i>For the rest of her days,</i>
<i>the gardener would gaze into reflections,</i>

39:29.375 --> 39:30.708
<i>hoping to see her face.</i>

39:31.208 --> 39:33.125
<i>Her own lady in the lake.</i>

39:34.208 --> 39:36.875
<i>She'd leave her door open at night,</i>
<i>just a crack,</i>

39:37.416 --> 39:38.791
<i>should she ever come back.</i>

39:39.958 --> 39:42.791
<i>Waiting for her lover to return.</i>

39:42.875 --> 39:43.958
[Jamie sighs heavily]

39:46.125 --> 39:47.916
[storyteller] Years would go by,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
and as she slept underneath the water,

39:50.500 --> 39:52.583
the au pair's memories would fade.

39:52.666 --> 39:57.791
Like Viola before her, like the children,
she, too, would forget her past.

39:59.250 --> 40:03.000
She would know nothing of the gardener,
nothing of their life together.

40:03.083 --> 40:04.291
[fire crackling]

40:04.833 --> 40:08.958
The details,
the specific moments would all fade away.

40:10.250 --> 40:11.791
More time will pass, and…

40:12.541 --> 40:15.250
the water will wash away
the delicate features of her.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.625
Of her beautiful, perfect face.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.666
But she won't be hollow, nor empty.

40:23.791 --> 40:25.791
And she won't pull others to her fate.

40:27.041 --> 40:29.958
She will merely walk the grounds of Bly,

40:30.041 --> 40:31.750
harmless as a dove,

40:32.458 --> 40:33.791
for all of her days.

40:34.750 --> 40:37.125
Leaving the only trace of who she once was

40:37.916 --> 40:40.166
in the memory
of the woman who loved her most.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.083
I'm sorry. [chuckles softly]

40:46.708 --> 40:47.625
I told you,

40:48.333 --> 40:50.458
the story wasn't exactly short.

40:50.541 --> 40:51.666
[guests chuckle]

40:51.750 --> 40:52.791
My God.

40:53.958 --> 40:55.166
So, is it true?

40:56.250 --> 40:57.083
Which part?

40:57.666 --> 40:58.583
[guest] I mean…

40:59.291 --> 41:02.833
if I were to fly to England,
and I were to visit Bly Manor,

41:04.208 --> 41:05.041
I may…

41:06.666 --> 41:10.041
get a peek of this lady in the lake?

41:10.625 --> 41:11.458
No.

41:12.333 --> 41:14.625
I expect if you were to fly to England,

41:15.125 --> 41:17.250
you would find no such place by that name.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.041
If you were to find the manor, though,

41:22.125 --> 41:23.291
perhaps you'd see her.

41:24.458 --> 41:27.125
Though, no way to know
when she's awake or asleep.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.250
Christ, is that the time?

41:32.125 --> 41:33.208
Big day tomorrow.

41:33.791 --> 41:34.750
Best get some rest.

41:37.958 --> 41:38.875
Hm.

41:52.458 --> 41:53.791
[groom] All right. Shall we?

41:54.375 --> 41:56.125
I think I'll stay here a moment.

41:56.791 --> 41:57.958
[groom] You okay?

41:58.041 --> 41:59.083
[bride] I'm perfect.

42:00.041 --> 42:01.291
Just enjoying the fire.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.000
-All right. I love you.
-I love you so.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.333
-Good night.
-[groom] Good night.

42:08.416 --> 42:09.791
[bride] He's the silliest.

42:09.875 --> 42:12.625
But, damn, if I don't love him the most.

42:13.375 --> 42:14.583
That's how it should be.

42:18.041 --> 42:19.083
I liked your story.

42:19.750 --> 42:20.583
I'm glad.

42:21.958 --> 42:24.000
But I think you set it up wrong,
in the beginning.

42:24.666 --> 42:25.541
Is that so?

42:26.250 --> 42:27.083
Yeah.

42:28.041 --> 42:29.708
You said it was a ghost story.

42:30.833 --> 42:32.708
-It isn't.
-No?

42:33.875 --> 42:34.916
It's a love story.

42:38.625 --> 42:39.583
Same thing, really.

42:42.666 --> 42:45.916
Well, if you go on to retell it,
make that change up top for me.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.708
Something on your mind?

42:51.541 --> 42:52.375
No.

42:53.458 --> 42:54.750
[chuckles] Not really.

42:57.833 --> 42:59.333
I just keep thinking…

43:00.166 --> 43:04.625
about that silly, gorgeous,
insane man I'm marrying tomorrow.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.166
I love him.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.500
More than I ever thought
I could love anybody.

43:09.166 --> 43:12.833
And the crazy thing is
he loves me the same exact amount.

43:15.458 --> 43:16.291
We got lucky.

43:17.208 --> 43:21.708
Sometimes when I'm sitting next to him,
in that easy silence…

43:23.958 --> 43:26.000
[crying]
…you only get with your forever person,

43:26.750 --> 43:28.875
who loves you as much as you love them,

43:28.958 --> 43:31.041
I start getting really, really terrified…

43:32.291 --> 43:33.208
that he's gonna…

43:34.291 --> 43:36.958
before I do,
and then what am I supposed to do?

43:38.250 --> 43:41.500
How am I supposed
to just live a life that he's not in?

43:43.666 --> 43:44.791
[sighs] Sorry.

43:45.458 --> 43:47.000
I don't know what's happening.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.041
[sniffles] I'm a mess. [laughs]

43:49.125 --> 43:50.958
No, you're not.

43:51.916 --> 43:54.333
I cry all the time, for no good reason.

43:57.208 --> 43:59.708
You shouldn't be thinking
of losing each other at all.

44:00.458 --> 44:03.166
Don't let that hang over
your happiness right now.

44:04.291 --> 44:06.083
Enjoy that easy silence with him.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.041
It is rare, what you've got.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.583
But, when the time does come,

44:14.708 --> 44:16.875
years and years from now, mind you…

44:16.958 --> 44:17.875
[bride chuckles]

44:18.500 --> 44:21.416
…it will be hard every day,
and it won't get easier.

44:21.500 --> 44:22.375
But…

44:23.916 --> 44:26.250
[sighs] …eventually, after some time,

44:26.750 --> 44:30.708
you'll find little moments,
little pieces of your life

44:31.416 --> 44:32.583
that remind you of him.

44:33.625 --> 44:35.166
And they'll be silly and dumb,

44:35.250 --> 44:38.416
or they'll be sad,
and you'll cry for hours.

44:39.666 --> 44:41.500
But they'll still be a piece of him.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.125
And you'll hold them tight.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.416
It'll be like he's here,

44:48.166 --> 44:49.000
with you.

44:50.583 --> 44:51.750
Even though he's gone.

44:54.250 --> 44:57.541
Now, you have a big day tomorrow.

44:58.666 --> 45:02.916
A happy day with your silly,
gorgeous, insane man.

45:03.458 --> 45:05.083
-[sniffles]
-You should sleep.

45:06.458 --> 45:07.291
Thank you.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.208
I feel like I should hug you.

45:12.125 --> 45:13.000
That's all right.

45:24.375 --> 45:25.208
You know…

45:26.041 --> 45:26.875
it's funny.

45:28.250 --> 45:31.208
I thought you might be making it up
just off that name.

45:32.291 --> 45:33.250
That name?

45:33.333 --> 45:35.666
But, then, I figured,
"How could you know that?"

45:37.791 --> 45:39.875
It's a funny coincidence, I suppose.

45:41.333 --> 45:43.000
My middle name is Flora.

45:44.583 --> 45:45.416
Is that right?

45:46.625 --> 45:47.583
Huh.

45:49.375 --> 45:50.208
Good night.

45:50.291 --> 45:51.166
Good night.

45:53.458 --> 45:54.750
