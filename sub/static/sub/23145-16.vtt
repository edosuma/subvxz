WEBVTT

00:00.812 --> 00:03.346
_

00:03.448 --> 00:06.248
First day of class. I'm back, baby!

00:06.351 --> 00:09.285
Ah! I see no one's discovered
my secret parking spot.

00:12.023 --> 00:14.290
Surf wheels!

00:14.392 --> 00:18.426
Hayley's back!
Did you see me see Hayley?!

00:21.064 --> 00:22.898
Sick trick, Hayley.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.635
Excuse me, dear.
You seem very comfortable here.

00:26.737 --> 00:29.972
Do you know where the
science trailer is?

00:30.073 --> 00:31.139
Freshmen.

00:31.141 --> 00:33.408
Come on. Roll with me.

00:35.479 --> 00:37.746
Name's Hayley. I'll show you the ropes.

00:38.682 --> 00:39.815
That's the first one.

00:39.917 --> 00:41.583
There are six more around campus.

00:41.685 --> 00:43.519
There's a lot of impromptu tug-of-war

00:43.621 --> 00:44.853
happening around here.

00:44.955 --> 00:46.087
Also kick the can.

00:46.189 --> 00:48.689
Pretty much any trash you
see lying around campus,

00:48.791 --> 00:50.024
we have a game for it.

00:50.762 --> 00:52.660
This is the dining
hall and computer lab.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.595
You should hear the fan in that Gateway.

00:54.697 --> 00:56.497
Try opening AltaVista and "Wolfenstein"

00:56.599 --> 00:57.832
at the same time.

00:57.934 --> 01:01.002
Blow your [BLEEP] eardrums out.

01:01.521 --> 01:02.603
Here's a gym.

01:02.705 --> 01:04.471
Team's getting ready
for a big game tonight.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.509
A foosball game?

01:08.611 --> 01:10.578
You play? You should try out for JV.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.581
No spinning, though. That's bitch play.

01:14.459 --> 01:16.717
Wow. You really know your stuff.

01:16.819 --> 01:18.085
Yeah, well, I love it here.

01:18.187 --> 01:20.854
And I plan to stay for a long,
long time.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.089
Hey, Hayley.
I thought I heard your wheels.

01:23.191 --> 01:26.159
One more credit to go,
and you are out of here, huh?

01:27.567 --> 01:29.729
What?! Th-That can't be right.

01:29.831 --> 01:31.464
I was going through school records

01:31.567 --> 01:34.133
and I found out <i>you</i> are one stamp away

01:34.235 --> 01:35.301
from graduating.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.469
But I don't want to graduate!

01:36.572 --> 01:37.971
And I don't want to
help my gross mom get

01:38.073 --> 01:39.639
in and out of her dumb wheelchair,

01:39.741 --> 01:42.576
but she paid for my house, so...

01:42.678 --> 01:45.078
You get what I'm saying, right?

01:47.749 --> 01:50.116
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

01:50.218 --> 01:54.020
♪ I got a feelin'

02:09.204 --> 02:10.769
Aah!

02:11.872 --> 02:14.974
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

02:17.945 --> 02:19.545
Roger, I need your help.

02:19.647 --> 02:21.180
Well, you've come to the right place.

02:21.282 --> 02:22.582
I'm Roger.

02:22.683 --> 02:24.750
Did you know Groff is
only a two-year school?

02:24.852 --> 02:26.685
I did know it was only two years,

02:26.787 --> 02:29.588
but I thought, legally,
they couldn't call it a school.

02:29.690 --> 02:31.223
They're gonna make me graduate!

02:31.325 --> 02:33.058
- And you don't want to leave.
- No!

02:33.160 --> 02:35.460
I am not ready for the real world...
Look at me.

02:35.562 --> 02:37.796
Ah! A Peter Pan situation.

02:37.898 --> 02:39.364
Well, you came to the right place.

02:39.466 --> 02:40.633
I'm Roger.

02:40.735 --> 02:42.300
Did I already say that? Doesn't matter.

02:42.402 --> 02:45.104
Anyhoo, give me 24 hours,
and I'll have your solution.

02:45.205 --> 02:47.640
Thanks. I knew
I could count on you, Roger.

02:47.742 --> 02:49.675
Looking for Roger? That's me.

02:49.777 --> 02:52.978
I'm Roger. Wait a second.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.047
Oh, I'm cleaning with gin.

02:55.149 --> 02:58.082
That means I've had
14 Pine-Sol martinis.

02:58.184 --> 03:02.453
And explains why my
diarrhea cleaned the toilet.

03:02.555 --> 03:04.255
I'm Roger.

03:07.894 --> 03:10.762
So, this is the room for rent.

03:10.864 --> 03:13.131
Obviously, it's got great natural light.

03:13.232 --> 03:15.432
And a lot of shared walls.

03:16.289 --> 03:17.235
Paper-thin.

03:17.236 --> 03:20.571
That's good, because I play <i> cool</i> music.

03:20.674 --> 03:21.973
Dad, what the hell?!

03:22.075 --> 03:24.408
This is that problem
tenant I told you about.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.177
Oh, hey, it's my little bookworm.

03:26.279 --> 03:28.412
About to graduate, spread her wings,

03:28.514 --> 03:29.580
and leave the nest.

03:29.683 --> 03:31.448
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.584
Actually, you are.

03:33.686 --> 03:36.187
Family rules clearly state,
"After college,

03:36.289 --> 03:38.455
"each child will forge out on their own

03:38.558 --> 03:40.491
"without financial or emotional support

03:40.593 --> 03:42.159
from the parents/guardians."

03:42.261 --> 03:43.960
The "emotional" part felt a little cold,

03:44.063 --> 03:47.064
but our lawyer at the time said
we need to protect ourselves.

03:51.637 --> 03:53.904
Nice! I could get used to this.

03:54.006 --> 03:56.574
Roger! You're trying to steal my room?

03:56.676 --> 03:57.841
Yeah. I need it.

03:57.943 --> 03:59.243
Made the mistake of
renting out the attic

03:59.345 --> 04:01.812
as a practice space for Rogu's ska band.

04:01.914 --> 04:04.181
They're terrible.
How do you screw up ska?

04:04.283 --> 04:06.048
- You're supposed to be helping me.
- Sorry.

04:06.150 --> 04:08.117
We got a drop-everything
kind of situation.

04:08.220 --> 04:10.220
This room hasn't been on
the market in 19 years,

04:10.322 --> 04:12.888
and the landlord doesn't have a friggin'
clue what it's worth.

04:12.990 --> 04:14.957
Plus, I'm buds
with the guy in the next unit.

04:15.059 --> 04:17.192
Make it happen, Rog!

04:23.099 --> 04:25.499
Whoa! Look at all these
hot-sauce packets.

04:25.601 --> 04:27.501
Del Taco Inferno!

04:27.603 --> 04:28.668
I always want to ask for it,

04:28.770 --> 04:30.137
but then I chicken out at the window.

04:30.239 --> 04:32.106
Take them. My car lease is up,

04:32.208 --> 04:33.672
and I got to get this thing cleaned out

04:33.774 --> 04:35.040
before I take it in.

04:35.143 --> 04:37.176
Mm... you've got a dent here.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.912
Returning it like this is
leaving money on the table.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.347
- Really?
- But...

04:41.449 --> 04:44.183
I could pop it out for you
right here in the garage.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.452
I used to be a little bit of an oil boy.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.653
A what?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.021
You know, a wrench monkey,

04:49.124 --> 04:51.357
a muffler humper, a tire charmer.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.492
A tailpipe Tony.

04:52.594 --> 04:54.460
- You mean a mechanic?
- Wuz dat?

04:54.562 --> 04:57.896
- Can you really fix the dent?
- Give me two days.

04:57.999 --> 05:00.433
Do you want me to do anything
about the interior smell?

05:00.535 --> 05:01.634
What smell?

05:01.636 --> 05:03.669
Okay.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.072
_

05:06.574 --> 05:10.142
- I scheduled a 2:00.
- Hey, my number-one senior.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.730
Sit down.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.981
I have got such a good feeling
about you, Smith.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.017
You're gonna make it on the outside.

05:18.119 --> 05:21.453
You are destined for
the Groff Wall of Fame.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.654
The what?

05:22.657 --> 05:24.389
These are all the Groff alumni

05:24.491 --> 05:25.791
who became famous.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.660
This guy right here went on to be

05:27.762 --> 05:29.628
the most prolific serial killer

05:29.730 --> 05:31.163
in Virginia history.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.498
These two... his first victims.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.834
Oh, and this last one is
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.836
the creator of TV's "Designing Women."

05:37.938 --> 05:39.271
She didn't go here.

05:39.373 --> 05:42.908
Actually, Cheryl,
I'd really like to avoid graduating.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.476
Totally understand.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.212
Between us,
it is hell on the other side.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.381
Oh, in fact,
I got to clock into my second job

05:49.483 --> 05:51.516
at Yoshinoya Beef Bowl in 12 minutes.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.252
And if I graduate,
I'm gonna be homeless.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.088
There is one way to
stay here indefinitely,

05:57.191 --> 05:59.057
but nobody's ever pulled it off.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.592
I'll try anything.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.061
Fail your class over and over

06:03.163 --> 06:05.630
and then retake it forever.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.933
A forever class! Of course!

06:09.035 --> 06:10.282
Thank you.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.704
Holy shit! I thought that was a poster!

06:12.806 --> 06:14.372
Oh, my God. Was that my ex?

06:14.474 --> 06:17.075
About yea high,
likes to show his entire gums?

06:17.177 --> 06:20.678
Can eat an entire apple in seconds? Ugh!

06:20.779 --> 06:22.346
You know what the sad part is?

06:22.448 --> 06:24.781
I'm probably gonna take him back.

06:29.488 --> 06:30.521
Hey, guess what.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.789
I'm gonna intentionally fail this class.

06:32.891 --> 06:34.124
Oh, we're friends?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.992
Can you drive me to the vet after this?

06:36.095 --> 06:38.495
My snake is sick.
I think I gave him an old mouse.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.698
We have to pick him up
from my stepdad's house.

06:40.799 --> 06:43.133
He lives in the woods.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.001
Excuse me. Could you keep it down?

06:45.104 --> 06:46.637
Some of us are trying to learn.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.805
Roger?! What are you doing here?

06:48.907 --> 06:50.207
It's Lacey Krinklehoel,

06:50.309 --> 06:52.309
and I'm here to make sure you graduate.

06:52.411 --> 06:53.877
This is about my room, isn't it?

06:53.979 --> 06:55.545
Sure is. Can you believe it?

06:55.647 --> 06:58.548
The valedictorian and star of
her high school's production

06:58.650 --> 07:02.017
of "Pirates of Penzance"
is here to help you graduate.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.353
You're lucky I couldn't go to Harvard

07:03.455 --> 07:06.389
because my mom got super-sick...
Don't ask.

07:06.491 --> 07:08.824
Now let's learn everything
there is to know about...

07:08.926 --> 07:10.092
advanced theory?

07:10.194 --> 07:12.328
Well, sorry, but you can't help me...

07:12.430 --> 07:16.198
if I'm in my van, smokin' doobie smacks.

07:16.301 --> 07:19.135
Professor,
what if we had class outside today?

07:19.237 --> 07:21.437
Maybe in the parking lot,
next to Hayley's van?

07:21.539 --> 07:24.507
Huh. Well, I would be closer
to my car when class ends.

07:24.609 --> 07:26.509
And who knows...
Maybe Ms. Smith will share

07:26.611 --> 07:29.646
those doobie smacks with
her favorite professor of...

07:29.748 --> 07:31.980
advanced theory?

07:35.791 --> 07:37.325
Lacey Krinklehoel?!

07:37.427 --> 07:39.126
Right? Such a good student.

07:39.228 --> 07:40.760
She worried about her grades so much,

07:40.862 --> 07:41.894
it gave her rickets.

07:41.897 --> 07:43.796
Look, I am failing this class,

07:43.899 --> 07:46.299
and there is nothing you or
your boring persona can do

07:46.402 --> 07:48.001
- to stop me.
- Boring?

07:48.103 --> 07:50.337
Does liking horses sound boring?

07:50.439 --> 07:52.239
Does reading "The Clan of the Cave Bear"

07:52.341 --> 07:54.174
50 times sound boring?

07:54.276 --> 07:56.676
Does collecting sand from every vacation

07:56.778 --> 07:58.345
she goes on sound boring?

07:58.447 --> 07:59.546
Well, that one sounds boring.

07:59.648 --> 08:02.416
But not when you see the little jars.

08:02.518 --> 08:04.051
Then it takes you right back

08:04.153 --> 08:07.320
to that magical summer you went to...

08:07.423 --> 08:08.555
sand.

08:08.657 --> 08:09.689
Huh.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.024
Hey, babe?

08:11.126 --> 08:14.194
Aren't you going to be late for school?

08:14.296 --> 08:16.696
New plan... not going.

08:16.798 --> 08:17.897
Sure you are.

08:17.899 --> 08:19.165
I didn't want to wake you,

08:19.267 --> 08:20.934
but I didn't want you to miss class.

08:21.036 --> 08:23.102
Roger, get us down from here!

08:23.204 --> 08:25.137
Babe, could you keep it down?

08:25.239 --> 08:27.540
And you're hogging all the blankets.

08:30.645 --> 08:32.712
_

08:32.813 --> 08:35.715
My favorite team is the Bazooka Sharks.

08:35.817 --> 08:36.916
We pay in dollars.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.184
In Germany, they use marks.

08:39.287 --> 08:41.220
Pretty excited about my slam poem.

08:41.322 --> 08:43.188
- How's yours?
- Non-existent.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.391
Don't worry. Lacey's got you.

08:45.493 --> 08:46.725
What i... What is it?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.561
Different trees have different barks.

08:49.663 --> 08:53.231
This poem is for Rosa Parks.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.834
Ms. Smith, excellent work.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.739
- Damn it! How did you...
- I was president of the A.V. Club.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.374
I did all the special effects for
"Pirates of Penzance"

09:03.477 --> 09:05.143
in addition to starring in it.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.979
The high-school paper declared it...

09:07.081 --> 09:09.681
"this year's musical."

09:12.086 --> 09:15.087
Hey, Lacey,
this midterm's worth 40% of our grade.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.588
Does this look like an "A"?

09:16.690 --> 09:19.290
It looks like an innocent horse's penis,
but...

09:19.392 --> 09:21.126
hanging from a man.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.361
You can't turn that in.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.565
Professor, I was thinking,
what if this midterm

09:27.667 --> 09:29.667
didn't count at all toward our grade?

09:29.769 --> 09:31.669
Huh. I like that.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.771
Shoot. But then what would count?

09:33.873 --> 09:36.107
The final... a speech that would count

09:36.209 --> 09:38.009
for 100% of our grade.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.611
100%?

09:39.712 --> 09:41.613
That's what we're trying to get to.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.248
And what if we do it in teams,

09:43.350 --> 09:45.416
but only one person has to present,

09:45.519 --> 09:47.084
and my partner is Hayley?

09:47.187 --> 09:50.355
Everyone, throw your midterms away,

09:50.457 --> 09:52.423
'cause the coolest teacher in school

09:52.526 --> 09:56.060
is doing a thing.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.398
Hey, Klaus, how's the dent looking?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.799
What happened to my car?!

10:02.901 --> 10:05.969
You have to take it apart
to put it back together.

10:06.071 --> 10:07.137
It was a dent!

10:07.239 --> 10:08.605
Puh! The dent.

10:08.707 --> 10:10.474
I wish the dent was our only problem.

10:10.576 --> 10:11.975
Look at this air filter.

10:12.077 --> 10:13.143
That's a muffler.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.645
Okay, little lady.

10:14.746 --> 10:16.746
You listened to "Car Talk"
a couple times, then...

10:16.848 --> 10:19.216
Klaus, I've got to turn this lease in!

10:19.318 --> 10:20.750
Fine! Turn it in now.

10:20.852 --> 10:21.918
I can get you a bag.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.187
What?! No!

10:23.289 --> 10:25.289
I need you to put this back together.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.490
Oh!

10:26.492 --> 10:28.091
So, you want me to do my job.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.560
Oh, I'd love to.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.095
You're back and forth
like a windshield wiper.

10:32.197 --> 10:33.329
Hey, Klaus?

10:33.431 --> 10:34.830
Your "Babes of Pennzoil" calendar came.

10:34.932 --> 10:35.964
Oh, good, good.

10:36.067 --> 10:39.168
Hang it in the very wet
bathroom with no lock.

10:41.739 --> 10:43.506
For this speech tomorrow, this book says

10:43.608 --> 10:45.675
to start with a joke or anecdote.

10:45.776 --> 10:47.710
Maybe I'll tell a joke,
and if no one laughs,

10:47.812 --> 10:49.111
I'll say it was an anecdote.

10:49.214 --> 10:50.313
That's perfect.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.080
What's going on, Hayley?

10:52.083 --> 10:54.083
I thought you were trying
to fail this class.

10:54.185 --> 10:56.219
I can't, not with you in my way.

10:56.321 --> 10:57.620
You're gonna crush the speech tomorrow.

10:57.722 --> 10:59.054
You're an amazing orator.

10:59.156 --> 11:00.756
Well, I was selected by my peers

11:00.858 --> 11:02.692
to read the Emancipation Proclamation

11:02.793 --> 11:04.293
at Disney World in Orlando.

11:04.395 --> 11:05.928
Jafar came up to me afterwards

11:06.030 --> 11:08.731
and said I changed his
mind about a lot of things.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.099
I bet you did.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.900
Say, since this is my last night

11:12.002 --> 11:13.135
in community college,

11:13.237 --> 11:15.204
how about you take me
out to one last hurrah?

11:15.305 --> 11:17.139
Some people from class are
having a little get-together.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.373
Sounds good.

11:18.475 --> 11:19.708
I usually like to go to bed early,

11:19.810 --> 11:21.977
but I had three rotisserie
chickens for lunch,

11:22.079 --> 11:24.913
so I have a little extra
energy to burn off.

11:26.617 --> 11:27.983
Oh, cheese and rice, Hayley!

11:28.085 --> 11:31.419
There's alcohol on the premises.
What if the police come?

11:31.521 --> 11:33.255
That girl's standing on the bed.

11:33.357 --> 11:35.057
Talk about your life being over.

11:35.159 --> 11:37.059
Oh, my gosh. I had no idea.

11:37.161 --> 11:39.094
Let's get out of here, Lacey.

11:39.196 --> 11:41.429
Wait. Is that Ronnie over there?

11:41.531 --> 11:43.631
I didn't know he was gonna be here.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.800
Don't you have a huge crush on him?

11:45.902 --> 11:47.835
- You should go talk to him.
- Oh, God!

11:47.937 --> 11:49.937
I can feel my rickets flaring up.

11:50.039 --> 11:51.372
Sounds like nerves.

11:51.474 --> 11:54.441
You're gonna need something
to help you relax.

11:54.543 --> 11:56.744
Alcohol's good for that.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.579
I guess I could have one.

11:58.681 --> 12:01.515
To a chaste kiss with Ronnie.

12:01.617 --> 12:03.751
Mmm! That's not too bad.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.686
Makes my tummy feel confident.

12:05.789 --> 12:09.090
And you look beautiful. Have some more.

12:09.192 --> 12:12.459
Look at me go, Hayley!
I'm coming out of my shell.

12:12.561 --> 12:15.263
Maybe I'll even let Ronnie hold my hand.

12:15.364 --> 12:17.497
I sucked seven [BLEEP],

12:17.599 --> 12:20.566
and I didn't even get to Ronnie.

12:22.137 --> 12:24.204
So, did we pass?

12:24.306 --> 12:25.605
Well, let's see.

12:25.707 --> 12:27.373
Lacey mostly talked about a party

12:27.475 --> 12:28.809
I wasn't invited to.

12:28.911 --> 12:31.044
The seven [BLEEP] part
was engaging, though.

12:31.146 --> 12:32.979
How about this? F-plus.

12:33.081 --> 12:34.647
No!

12:34.749 --> 12:38.051
Now I'll never go to Harvard
and make my sick mother proud!

12:38.153 --> 12:41.221
She has the bubonic plague.
Thanks for asking, by the way.

12:41.323 --> 12:42.555
She was camping in New Mexico,

12:42.657 --> 12:44.925
and some squirrel
feces got in her mouth.

12:48.997 --> 12:50.330
What the hell?!

12:50.432 --> 12:51.997
Where's my car?

12:52.099 --> 12:54.266
Which one's yours? The yellow F-150?

12:54.369 --> 12:55.468
No, Klaus.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.636
You said two days.

12:56.738 --> 12:58.504
It's been a month.

12:58.606 --> 13:00.206
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

13:00.308 --> 13:01.808
I have a lot to do around here.

13:01.909 --> 13:04.544
I just finished making sure
the coffee is super-bitter,

13:04.646 --> 13:06.713
greased up all the <i>Sports Illustrateds,</i>

13:06.815 --> 13:10.149
and some jerk keeps lowering
the volume on "TMZ."

13:10.251 --> 13:12.284
Fine. You can have two more days.

13:12.387 --> 13:14.186
Two days. Ooh!

13:14.288 --> 13:17.223
That's when your Coleman
beer-can chicken roaster rack

13:17.325 --> 13:18.691
is supposed to arrive.

13:18.793 --> 13:20.760
Ugh! Too bad
your Good Grips salad spinner

13:20.862 --> 13:22.328
is back-ordered for another week.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.063
That could have been a cool combo

13:24.165 --> 13:25.665
for, like, a backyard party.

13:25.767 --> 13:28.500
Have you been spying
on my Amazon account?

13:28.602 --> 13:30.935
- Yes.
- Why?

13:31.037 --> 13:33.137
I think you have an exciting account.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.840
Thank you.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:54.123 --> 13:57.829
Listen up. We have
some unsavory news to share.

13:57.931 --> 13:59.463
I'm going to turn it over to Cheryl,

13:59.565 --> 14:02.300
my colleague here and
at Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

14:02.402 --> 14:04.202
Thank you, my Beef Bowl brother.

14:04.304 --> 14:06.204
Okay. This is never easy.

14:06.306 --> 14:07.872
Tragically, last night,

14:07.974 --> 14:10.732
Lacey Krinklehoel took her own life.

14:12.245 --> 14:15.880
She jumped from the clock tower
after unnecessarily dragging

14:15.982 --> 14:18.116
a long wooden plank to the top.

14:18.218 --> 14:21.119
Apparently, she was, until the very end,

14:21.221 --> 14:23.754
so proud of her work in
her high-school production

14:23.856 --> 14:25.924
of "Pirates of Penzance."

14:26.026 --> 14:28.092
And one!

14:28.194 --> 14:30.161
Oh, please.
You guys don't know her like I do.

14:30.263 --> 14:31.729
She's gonna be fine.

14:31.831 --> 14:35.265
And so, in accordance with
Groff Community College by-laws,

14:35.367 --> 14:38.368
the partner of any student
who commits suicide

14:38.471 --> 14:40.971
is awarded an automatic "A."

14:41.073 --> 14:42.640
No!

14:42.742 --> 14:45.142
In lieu of official grief counseling,

14:45.244 --> 14:47.578
the school is partnering with Yoshinoya

14:47.680 --> 14:49.914
to offer all grieving students coupons

14:50.015 --> 14:52.583
for brown rice at the white-rice price.

14:52.685 --> 14:54.184
Now, I'm gonna tell you up front,

14:54.286 --> 14:58.388
because we've had some issues,
it is a mail-in rebate.

14:58.491 --> 14:59.990
So, come on down to Yoshinoya

15:00.092 --> 15:03.060
so we can get to Yoshi-know each other.

15:07.049 --> 15:10.129
Here's an apartment
that's perfect for us.

15:10.231 --> 15:11.363
This is a photo of a cup.

15:11.465 --> 15:13.866
I'm thirsty.

15:13.968 --> 15:16.301
Oh, my God! I just heard about Lacey.

15:16.403 --> 15:17.837
That's crazy!

15:17.939 --> 15:19.571
I can't believe you killed her.

15:19.673 --> 15:21.607
I passed my class because of you.

15:21.709 --> 15:24.009
Oh, my God! The bylaws!

15:24.112 --> 15:27.213
I didn't even think about
Section 13A, Subset "G."

15:27.314 --> 15:29.181
But that would mean
you're gonna graduate.

15:29.283 --> 15:32.885
And I didn't hire these
shirtless movers for nothing!

15:32.987 --> 15:36.055
Let's see if my stud finder's working.

15:40.027 --> 15:41.627
Stud detected.

15:47.668 --> 15:50.001
Ah, the classic stud-finder bit.

15:50.103 --> 15:52.937
I know it's a dad joke,
but I still like it.

15:55.504 --> 15:56.575
It's been two days!

15:56.677 --> 15:58.176
Give me my damn car!

15:58.279 --> 15:59.544
- Which one is it?
- Klaus!

15:59.647 --> 16:01.380
I'm kidding. It's ready.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.947
I'll have my guy bring it around.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.650
Mijo!

16:05.046 --> 16:07.016
_

16:07.354 --> 16:10.244
_

16:10.245 --> 16:11.457
_

16:11.492 --> 16:14.546
_

16:14.561 --> 16:16.194
I know what's going on in my shop.

16:16.239 --> 16:17.303
_

16:17.863 --> 16:19.530
Did Steve learn Spanish?

16:19.632 --> 16:21.766
I think you're really
gonna like what we did.

16:24.103 --> 16:25.436
What is that noise?

16:25.538 --> 16:27.471
Whistle tips!

16:30.376 --> 16:31.442
Okay, pay attention.

16:31.544 --> 16:33.010
You've got an 8-ball stick shift now.

16:33.112 --> 16:34.144
Very cool.

16:34.146 --> 16:35.613
I know it was an automatic before.

16:35.715 --> 16:36.980
It's kind of a hybrid now.

16:37.082 --> 16:39.183
For gears 1 and 2, you have to shift,

16:39.285 --> 16:41.919
but, realistically,
how often do you use those gears?

16:42.021 --> 16:43.754
We installed a nitrous button.

16:43.856 --> 16:45.989
It's not connected to anything,
but it's there.

16:46.091 --> 16:47.692
This is a disaster, Klaus.

16:47.794 --> 16:49.092
Um, check again.

16:49.195 --> 16:52.095
I added a super-super- long antenna.

16:52.198 --> 16:54.898
It has incredible bounce.
Look how it catches the wind.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.500
You don't even feel, Francine.

16:57.602 --> 16:59.903
_

17:00.005 --> 17:01.805
Tomorrow, my little girl receives

17:01.907 --> 17:03.640
her community-college diploma...

17:03.742 --> 17:05.474
Color-printed and laminated.

17:05.577 --> 17:06.710
To Hayley's diploma.

17:06.811 --> 17:08.945
It's just a stupid piece of paper.

17:09.048 --> 17:10.646
I've got a whole ream of paper.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.382
I can print whatever I want on it.

17:12.483 --> 17:13.583
You sure can.

17:13.685 --> 17:15.385
But every day is your day, honey.

17:15.487 --> 17:17.420
Today, we're celebrating the girl.

17:17.521 --> 17:18.821
- To Hayley!
- To my room!

17:18.924 --> 17:20.557
To my new room! Hip, hip...

17:20.659 --> 17:22.759
- Hooray!
- Opotamus!

17:22.862 --> 17:24.694
Oh, don't feel bad, Hayley.

17:24.796 --> 17:26.529
You didn't have a chance to beat Lacey.

17:26.631 --> 17:28.832
She was possibly my greatest creation.

17:28.933 --> 17:29.966
What?!

17:30.068 --> 17:32.736
She was the most boring,
uninspired persona

17:32.838 --> 17:34.003
you have ever had.

17:34.105 --> 17:35.137
Uninspired?!

17:35.240 --> 17:36.272
She was flawless.

17:36.274 --> 17:37.440
She sucked.

17:37.542 --> 17:38.675
She was an angel.

17:38.777 --> 17:40.142
It's a tragedy she had to die

17:40.245 --> 17:41.845
just to get you out of your room.

17:41.946 --> 17:43.946
I guess that's the silver lining...

17:44.048 --> 17:45.047
Lacey's dead.

17:45.049 --> 17:46.549
You keep her name out of your mouth!

17:46.651 --> 17:49.151
Hmm. You're really sensitive about this.

17:49.254 --> 17:52.088
I'm sorry that I'm
sensitive about sacrificing

17:52.190 --> 17:54.524
such a brave and confident soul.

17:54.626 --> 17:57.260
I'm so upset,
I can't even eat my side salad.

17:57.362 --> 18:00.597
Look at this pale tomato
wedge I was so excited to eat.

18:00.699 --> 18:02.498
It's the color of uncooked salmon,

18:02.600 --> 18:05.301
the most delicious color of all!

18:06.670 --> 18:07.691
I'm gonna take this.

18:09.107 --> 18:10.373
Hmm.

18:10.474 --> 18:12.775
_

18:12.877 --> 18:14.777
Okeydokey, one more warm hand

18:14.879 --> 18:16.112
for your commencement speaker,

18:16.214 --> 18:19.916
Mr. Giggles and his goofy balloon show!

18:22.253 --> 18:23.819
I am sorry there wasn't enough time

18:23.922 --> 18:25.721
for him to make a hat for everybody.

18:25.823 --> 18:28.524
And now your student speaker,

18:28.626 --> 18:29.758
Hayley Smith.

18:34.534 --> 18:35.364
Thank you.

18:35.366 --> 18:38.500
This may surprise some of you,
but up until recently,

18:38.602 --> 18:40.469
I didn't even want to graduate.

18:40.571 --> 18:41.904
I was scared.

18:42.005 --> 18:44.506
But then I met someone
who changed all that,

18:44.608 --> 18:45.974
Lacey Krinklehoel.

18:46.076 --> 18:47.709
Sounds like quite the young woman.

18:47.812 --> 18:48.977
Heard her mother was sick.

18:49.079 --> 18:50.946
Lacey was the only person I knew

18:51.048 --> 18:54.115
who was more afraid and
insecure than I was.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.584
That doesn't sound right, exactly.

18:55.686 --> 18:59.421
Seeing how pathetic she
was made me feel braver

18:59.523 --> 19:00.789
and more confident.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.791
She lied to try and fit in.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.225
She lied about volunteering.

19:04.328 --> 19:07.262
She lied about her
field-hockey triumphs.

19:07.364 --> 19:09.530
She didn't lie about loving horses.

19:09.632 --> 19:13.768
She even lied about starring in
"Pirates of Penzance."

19:13.870 --> 19:17.072
She's entering libel terr...
t-territory now.

19:17.174 --> 19:19.307
But today, isn't about her.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.977
In fact,
it will never be about her again,

19:22.079 --> 19:25.080
because she's as dead as she was boring.

19:25.182 --> 19:26.948
♪ Penzance! Penzance! ♪

19:27.050 --> 19:28.783

19:41.364 --> 19:43.330
Lacey Krinklehoel alive?

19:43.432 --> 19:46.700
Change the transcripts!
Hayley Smith fails!

19:46.802 --> 19:48.502
Hayley stays!

19:53.976 --> 19:55.742
That was some shit, Hayley.

19:55.844 --> 19:58.678
- I warned you.
- Well, game respects game.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.780
For what it's worth,
if you did graduate,

20:00.883 --> 20:02.849
I think you'd be just
fine on the outside.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.685
Maybe, but I hope
I never have to find out.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.021
Oh, I got to bounce.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.822
My character who gets
trapped in elevators

20:08.924 --> 20:10.624
needs to get food poisoning first.

20:10.726 --> 20:12.459
It really makes everyone I'm stuck with

20:12.561 --> 20:14.528
<i>feel</i> the panic.

20:29.477 --> 20:31.577
Is that a Decepticon sticker?

20:31.679 --> 20:32.845
- Klaus?
- Huh?

20:32.947 --> 20:33.979
Oh, yeah.

20:33.981 --> 20:36.215
Wow! Wow! Okay, then.

20:36.317 --> 20:38.518
I don't know what to say,
other than this car...

20:38.619 --> 20:41.154
rules!

20:41.256 --> 20:43.322
And this thing is nitrous-ready?

20:43.425 --> 20:45.491
Ready and waiting.

20:45.593 --> 20:47.393
Bye-bye, bad guys.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.862
This all looks great, ma'am.

20:49.964 --> 20:51.163
Only thing I have to charge you for

20:51.265 --> 20:53.098
is this dent down here in the corner.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.199
Klaus!

20:54.201 --> 20:55.434
Oh, did your goldfish not

20:55.536 --> 20:58.236
do a good-enough job fixing your car?

20:58.338 --> 21:00.905
Bye! Have a great time!
