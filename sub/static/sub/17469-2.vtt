WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:04.173
I want to remind you
that this is a safe space...

00:04.337 --> 00:06.749
...and the purpose of this exercise...

00:06.906 --> 00:10.945
...is for you to acknowledge
the truth of your experiences.

00:12.545 --> 00:17.790
Raise your hand if you've ever had a
sexual relationship with someone at work.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.423
<i>Okay-</i>

00:21.588 --> 00:24.967
Raise your hand if you've
ever slept with your boss.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.571
If you're not sure if the man
you're thinking of is your boss or not...

00:30.730 --> 00:33.802
...but you are sure you screwed him,
raise your hand.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.537
<i>Okay-</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:40.810
Next week, we'll try that
with your eyes open.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.919
- Hi.
- All she wants to do is sing...

00:49.082 --> 00:51.323
...from the moment she wakes up.

00:51.484 --> 00:54.556
- You must be exhausted.
- Same time next week?

00:54.721 --> 00:57.930
We alternate between here
and my friend's apartment one floor up.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.365
Let me introduce you.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.439
- Hi. Eleanor.
- Ariana.

01:03.663 --> 01:06.940
- Would you like some?
- Let me rescue you from your staring.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.171
You might start making
people uncomfortable.

01:09.335 --> 01:13.147
I've just never been a part of
something like this before.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.645
- How are you?
- Good. Thanks.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.747
<i>Okay-</i>

01:19.212 --> 01:21.214
Did you talk to Lenny
about the diaphragm?

01:21.381 --> 01:24.294
I called my doctor,
and I'm getting a new one, so--

01:24.884 --> 01:26.488
No.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.395
I couldn't talk to Lenny.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.968
I just couldn't.

01:32.625 --> 01:33.831
I've never been married...

01:33.993 --> 01:37.497
...but I guess I thought you could
talk to your husband about everything.

01:37.964 --> 01:41.844
- Again, I wouldn't know.
- Yeah. No. Heh, heh.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.349
She's terrifying.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.145
- Who is she?
- Eleanor Holmes Norton.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.186
She's an attorney from the ACLU.

01:51.344 --> 01:54.757
She drops in on these meetings
to wake women up, so she says.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.362
- How do you ladies know each other?
- We work together.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.658
- At News of the <i>Week.</i>
- Ahh. Fancy publication.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.529
Yeah. It's fun.
No day is ever the same as the next.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.605
Oh, I wasn't as taken with it. I quit.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.899
- Why?
- They don't let women write.

02:10.062 --> 02:15.035
We do write files for the reporters
to help them with their stories.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.112
So is that the role that you want?

02:17.270 --> 02:19.546
Being of service to men?

02:20.406 --> 02:22.682
It's the tradition there.

02:22.842 --> 02:26.312
You know what else was a tradition?
Separate water fountains.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.722
It's not like that.

02:28.882 --> 02:34.195
If women aren't allowed the same
kinds of jobs as men, that's illegal.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.656
- Illegal?
- Yes.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.932
Ladies.

02:39.092 --> 02:42.164
Circle back up for our final exercise.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.205
Oh, and please bring your compacts.

02:44.364 --> 02:49.837
We're going to be celebrating our
beautiful bodies by looking at our vulvas.

02:50.570 --> 02:51.640
I think I'm gonna go.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.943
- I'm gonna come with you.
- Okay.

02:54.307 --> 02:58.312
You ladies have a case.
I want to talk to you more about it.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.529
Did she just say "vulva"?

Marybeth?

06:13.906 --> 06:15.943
Oh, my God.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.556
Come on.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.126
Hi, sissy.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.790
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.262
Hey, you two look adorable.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.501
We got engaged.

06:38.364 --> 06:41.641
Look at that stardust.

06:41.801 --> 06:45.840
Yes, we were at Rockefeller Plaza
just now. He got down on one knee.

06:46.005 --> 06:49.179
I was down there for about 45 minutes
before she could answer.

06:49.342 --> 06:53.415
Everyone was clapping.
It was so special, Patti.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.853
Oh, wow.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.592
I had to come and tell you
before anyone else.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.855
I'm so glad you did.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.657
I'm so surprised.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.495
I'm happy. I'm happy for you.
Of course I'm happy for you.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.501
- I'm so happy for you. Oh.
- Thank you.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.734
We have so much to do
in a few weeks.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.605
- Let's just enjoy it tonight.
- Wait. Why so fast?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.838
I go off to basic in February.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.482
I didn't know you enlisted.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.549
Yeah, his number was
drawn at the lottery.

07:20.706 --> 07:25.519
- Yeah, on television two nights ago.
- I watched it, but they didn't say names.

07:25.678 --> 07:28.022
Randy, I'm so sorry.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.122
Um, heh.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.725
- It's okay.
- Take off your coats.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.559
- Are you hungry? You want food?
- We can't stay.

07:35.721 --> 07:39.726
Yeah. My hazard lights are on
down at the curb, so we should--

07:39.892 --> 07:41.769
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.168
But come home tomorrow.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.400
You Mom's making a huge dinner.
It'll be fun.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.873
I have to work.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.876
But I'll try to figure something out.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.983
- We should get going.
- Hey.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.384
Thank you for coming
to tell me in person.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.542
That means a lot.

07:56.709 --> 08:00.179
It's just dinner, if you can stand it.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.825
I can stand it.

08:02.181 --> 08:05.822
It would mean a lot to me,
and you haven't been home in months.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.465
I'll be there.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.203
You know, thank God you changed it.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.274
I was starting to see polka dots.
It was like a circus.

08:51.430 --> 08:54.138
The Feds say they're responding
proportionately to threats.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.713
Hoover wants millions of dollars
and a big bump in manpower.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.544
My source tipped me to an item in the
new budget under domestic surveillance.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.380
- It was buried.
- Dig up that damn grave.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.284
How are they justifying the ask?

09:05.444 --> 09:08.015
Hoover's guys point to
crime stats in big cities.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.751
Bullshit. Which kinds of crime?
What cities?

09:10.917 --> 09:12.225
While you're up their ass...

09:12.385 --> 09:14.797
...find out if they're buying
new wiretap gadgets.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.764
I love the G-man equipment.
Ralph, you're on Altamont follow.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.905
Make sure Rolling Stone knows
we're not backing down on coverage.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.505
You got it.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.505
Wick?

09:25.164 --> 09:27.235
Wick, are you in there?

09:27.934 --> 09:30.574
I'm sorry, but there's a phone call.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.181
Wick?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.179
You better have the fucking
ghost of JFK on the phone.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.844
It's Mamie.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.681
Goddamn it.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.761
Sam, your exit interview
with the Fed chairman. How are we?

09:46.919 --> 09:48.660
There's nothing I don't
know about the recession...

09:48.821 --> 09:50.698
...or deposit ceiling rates of interest.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.393
My bond trader buddies tell me
Martin's defending the gold standard...

09:53.559 --> 09:54.970
...despite Nixon's objections.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.664
There's no rationale
for the gold standard anymore.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.709
It's magical thinking.
Get him to admit that, you'll have a story.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.277
You know...

10:03.302 --> 10:05.714
...Martin and I played in
a charity golf tournament.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.044
He's not funny.
"Just the facts" kind of guy...

10:08.207 --> 10:10.653
...who knows the whole world
hangs on his every word.

10:10.810 --> 10:14.019
I speak for Jews when I say that's
who I want in charge of my money.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.921
Newbie's got a sense of humor.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.295
- When's the sit-down?
- Four.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.556
Let me know how that goes.
And don't sweat it.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.997
Martin's only one of the smartest men
on planet Earth. You'll be fine.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.837
Thank you, boys. Meeting is adjourned.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.807
Uh. Mamie Eisenhower's bloomers
are in a bunch...

10:37.970 --> 10:40.849
...because she did not
get her Sunday copy of the magazine.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.545
Finn, you had me take her off,
unless I'm mistaken.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.924
I thought I was in charge
of the Sunday Night List.

10:50.082 --> 10:51.789
Yes, but I wanted to add somebody.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.659
When I add somebody,
I take somebody off. Keeps it special.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.857
- Who did you add?
- Kirk Douglas.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.262
Kirk Douglas.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.139
So we bump a former first lady...

11:04.296 --> 11:08.745
...and the widow of the finest military mind
of our era...

11:08.901 --> 11:10.744
...for a Hollywood pretty boy?

11:10.903 --> 11:12.177
Our Sunday Night List is...

11:12.338 --> 11:14.944
...the 40 most powerful
decision makers and influencers.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.383
Mamie is the relic of a dead president.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.284
Finn, he sells popcorn.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.426
I admire his success,
his taste, and his wife.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.187
He's the only man in America
I can say that about.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.468
Pardon me.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.808
How was the story meeting?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.947
We're doing a piece on the FBI
upping their domestic surveillance.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.155
Who are they surveilling?

11:54.313 --> 11:56.020
The bad guys.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.962
What am I doing here?

12:02.621 --> 12:03.691
Oh.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.326
Are you okay?

12:07.860 --> 12:09.305
No.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.602
My little sister got engaged.

12:11.931 --> 12:16.641
It's not as scary as domestic surveillance,
but it still freaks me out.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.782
- Is the guy a jerk?
- No.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.985
He's from our neighborhood.
Randy. He's a wrestler.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.589
- All state, actually.
- Yeah? What weight class?

12:26.746 --> 12:29.249
- That's not the point.
- Then what is the point?

12:29.815 --> 12:31.351
She's only 18.

12:31.851 --> 12:35.162
And she's never been
outside of our town.

12:35.321 --> 12:38.131
She doesn't know what
her choices are.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.930
And now she's gonna get married...

12:41.093 --> 12:43.596
...and be of service
to a high school wrestler.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.434
You know,
my parents got married at 18.

12:48.601 --> 12:52.378
They went to college together.
They're still going strong.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.479
You met my parents, right?

12:55.841 --> 12:57.718
Oh. No. You didn't.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.686
Okay. I knew that if I told you...

12:59.845 --> 13:02.917
...I was going to San Francisco
to get a story for Sam...

13:03.082 --> 13:04.959
...you would have told me not to.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.256
You have no idea
what I would have said.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.418
Ugh. Damn it.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.179
This is not your toilet.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.596
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Thank you. Thank you.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.534
Oh, God. Sorry.
I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you.

13:56.302 --> 13:59.044
I did it. I looked down there.

13:59.205 --> 14:04.553
And it did not make me feel beautiful.
It made me feel not normal.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.383
Do you know
what normal looks like?

14:06.545 --> 14:09.219
Well, I mean,
I had an image in my mind...

14:09.381 --> 14:13.124
...you know, but that image did not
match what I saw down there.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.232
I can't stop thinking about
that woman from the ACLU.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.492
- Oh, good morning.
- Hi.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.798
- Where are you going?
- To run errands for Doug.

14:22.962 --> 14:26.739
- Jane, have you looked at your vulva?
- What? No. Patti. No. That is medical.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.810
That is for my doctor.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.811
- And my future husband.
- Yeah.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.712
- Wait a second. Jane, are you a virgin?
- Mm-hm.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.114
Ohh. I don't think that's a good idea.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.755
- If it's what she wants.
- It is what I want.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.255
Jimi Hendrix wants you to be
experienced for your--

14:41.413 --> 14:43.154
I was a virgin when I got married.

14:43.315 --> 14:45.454
I just looked at my vulva
for the first time.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.599
- Yeah.
- Okay. We are at work.

14:49.088 --> 14:53.127
But for the record, I am proud to know
that my white wedding will not be a fraud.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.203
For the record,
you do other stuff, right?

14:55.361 --> 14:56.931
- I did.
- Well, I'm not frigid.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.666
So, what do you do? Blowjobs?

14:58.831 --> 14:59.969
- No.
- Really?

15:00.132 --> 15:01.975
- God, I did.
- Hand jobs?

15:02.134 --> 15:04.011
You know,
BJs always hurt my neck though.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.615
I could never find a good angle.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.651
- You use your hand at the same--
- The two of you out please.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.651
Go be crude somewhere else.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.454
- Enjoy your vulva.
- Oh, Patti.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.001
My great thinkers, listen up, please.

15:29.161 --> 15:33.667
I may regret this, but at the moment
I'm interested in your nascent opinions.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.540
Everyone on our
musty Sunday Night List...

15:36.702 --> 15:38.648
...is now officially up for grabs.

15:38.804 --> 15:41.785
Who do we want to get our news first?
Who's relevant?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.648
Wick has a hard on
for Mamie Eisenhower.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.311
Jesus.

15:45.477 --> 15:49.118
- Anybody? What do you got?
- Brady, you sewed.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.323
Talk some sense into this tenderfoot.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.191
Sorry, chief, I'm a Stevenson man.
I went to Princeton.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.094
- What year?
-'58.

15:56.255 --> 15:57.290
Go, Tigers.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.837
Does Jackie get a copy?

16:00.993 --> 16:03.200
- Indefinitely.
- How about Senator Russell?

16:03.362 --> 16:06.070
All the congressional leadership,
cabinet secretaries, Teddy Kennedy.

16:06.231 --> 16:07.835
- All covered.
- Even after Chappaquiddick?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.413
He's a living Kennedy.
How about Goldwater?

16:11.570 --> 16:13.550
Ever since we put Mao on the cover,
he won't touch us.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.811
The Madame Mao centerfold
was one of our best.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.354
- Right you are, Jane.
- Gil? Gil Hodges?

16:19.511 --> 16:22.048
You're fired. I'm a Yankees fan.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.521
He's joking. I think.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.221
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Joe Namath and not Johnny Unitas?

16:28.387 --> 16:31.197
- Are you kidding me?
- Good point. Scratch Namath.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.893
- No.
- Namath's a fox.

16:33.359 --> 16:37.034
Well, the girls like their beefcake.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.000
Beefcake Namath stays for the pit.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.702
Thank you.

16:43.135 --> 16:47.083
Thank you all for your valuable opinions,
gentlemen and ladies.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.623
- My questions for Chairman Martin.
- Type them up?

16:54.847 --> 16:58.124
Hey, this is not the poll I got.
That's the poll I got.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.404
Gabe.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.598
- Jane.
- That's right.

17:11.763 --> 17:15.075
I like your vest.
You dress like my grandfather.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.771
- Is that a...?
- Compliment? Yes.

17:17.935 --> 17:21.577
I admire my grandfather.
He was very stylish.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.050
Wick wants you to select
a replacement for Nora.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.517
They're all qualified girls.

17:25.676 --> 17:30.092
Ahem. I feel the need to intercede here.
Big opportunity, young man.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.458
- He's picking a new girl today.
- Let's see what we've got here.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.361
<i>They've been vetted by the agency
and pie-approved by personnel.</i>

17:36.522 --> 17:40.095
Bernice Hafner types 50 words a minute.
Had her cherry popped at the Dailies-.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.364
Not possible.
Only prudes work at the Dailies.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.099
And they can all start
by end of the day. Good luck.

17:46.031 --> 17:48.910
Whoever you call, make sure
she has dimples of Venus.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.344
- What are those?
- And are they contagious?

17:51.503 --> 17:53.039
- Get her waist size.
- What? No.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.479
Get it.

18:02.881 --> 18:06.693
Mm. "Is that a delicious peace offering?"

18:07.086 --> 18:11.330
Why, Doug, I'm so glad you asked.
Yes. Yes, it is.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.767
This is your favorite
pre-lunch second breakfast:

18:14.927 --> 18:18.932
Two strips of crispy,
never burned, bacon...

18:19.098 --> 18:20.771
...and orange slices.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.842
I know you're still mad
that I stood you up...

18:25.003 --> 18:27.813
...and that I helped Sam
with his Altamont cover.

18:27.973 --> 18:31.182
I understand you might need
some more time to cool down from that.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.448
- Still--
- If I may...

18:33.612 --> 18:35.990
...you're doing really well right now.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.452
Resist the urge to get the last word in.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.831
Still, I'm ready, even eager,
to move forward whenever you are.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.873
Mmm.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.944
- Thank you.
- Mm.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.840
How can I help?

19:01.974 --> 19:06.889
This is last year's FBI budget.
This is the new proposed one.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.889
The Bureau's gross budget
simply keeps up with inflation...

19:10.048 --> 19:12.460
...which means the increase
in counter-surveillance numbers..

19:12.618 --> 19:15.030
...deprived some poor department
of their funding.

19:15.187 --> 19:17.997
- So who got the smaller piece of the pie?
- Exactly.

19:18.157 --> 19:22.435
That'll lead to who the Bureau considers
a big enough threat to throw money at.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.669
I'm looking at gear
and materiel right now.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.971
- Finn's hot for G-man equipment.
- Good to know.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.943
Why don't you
compare staffing budgets?

19:31.470 --> 19:32.847
<i>Okay-</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:39.580
Mm, mm.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.891
- Are you gonna hum while you chew?
- Yes.

19:45.450 --> 19:49.398
- But only as long as it bothers you.
- Ah. Got it.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.784
I'm gonna have to
put you to work after lunch.

20:11.944 --> 20:15.915
I am working right now.
I've done six captions since I got here.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.762
More work. I need you to sit while
I adjust these fill lights.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.060
- Sure.
- I'm taking staff photos.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.066
Oh, for award submissions?

20:26.558 --> 20:27.662
Mm-hm.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.536
Have you won lots of awards?

20:32.130 --> 20:35.134
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- That means that you have.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.780
Did I tell you about
the best staff photo ever taken?

20:37.936 --> 20:40.542
No, but now I'm not gonna
sit for you until you do.

20:40.706 --> 20:44.620
I'll bring it tomorrow.
It was this guy at the Post-Gazette...

20:44.776 --> 20:47.723
...who had one ear he could make
a few inches higher than the other.

20:47.879 --> 20:51.326
At first, you don't know
what's strange about this guy...

20:51.483 --> 20:54.930
...and then it's the
only thing you can see.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.226
- Ha-ha.
- He was cool.

20:57.389 --> 21:00.336
He made the paper use that
for the Pulitzer submission.

21:00.492 --> 21:03.439
Our priest used to move his hairline.

21:03.862 --> 21:07.173
Yeah, it looked like someone
was just tugging on a wig.

21:07.332 --> 21:12.111
- I want to see a priest do that.
- Well, he died so...

21:14.539 --> 21:15.984
Oh, sorry.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.683
No. He's alive.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.553
- Don't look into the sun.
- Oh, God.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.595
- Do not look directly into the sun.
- Ahh. Ahh.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.430
Denise, you have
a beautiful speaking voice.

21:33.592 --> 21:38.041
And your boss at The Star
said you were a good girl.

21:42.501 --> 21:47.177
You know what, it says here you're 25.
Is that your age or your waist size?

21:50.509 --> 21:52.785
You're honest. I like that.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.762
Uh-huh.

22:00.919 --> 22:03.957
So you have the address?

22:04.122 --> 22:06.830
Okay. Well, then we'll
see you this afternoon.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.335
Bye-bye.

22:19.905 --> 22:23.216
I typed up the questions, starting
with general present-day issues...

22:23.375 --> 22:26.117
...and ending with Martin's
goals for his legacy.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.757
Where's the question
on defense spending?

22:27.913 --> 22:31.793
All post-war spending
is on the second page. It's all there.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.690
Are you nervous?

22:36.321 --> 22:37.823
Try to get past the economics.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.991
With the chairman of
the Federal Reserve?

22:40.158 --> 22:41.933
And unearth his private life.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.401
You think that's the key to this?

22:44.563 --> 22:47.043
My father says,
"Get a man to talk about his family...

22:47.199 --> 22:48.803
...and you'll end up hearing
about his business."

22:48.967 --> 22:50.844
And what is
Daddy Hollander's advice...

22:51.002 --> 22:53.778
...about how to get
his daughter to go outwith me?

23:09.287 --> 23:10.732
My brain hurts.

23:11.757 --> 23:15.432
I never feel stiff until
I see someone else stretching.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.841
You need a break?

23:21.299 --> 23:25.008
I just wish Randy hadn't been drafted.
Because if he hadn't been drafted...

23:25.170 --> 23:27.480
...I think that his
relationship with Marybeth...

23:27.639 --> 23:30.142
...would have run its course
in a couple of months.

23:30.308 --> 23:31.446
How do you know that?

23:31.610 --> 23:33.817
Marybeth is so smart.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.981
She's the smartest one
of all of my sisters.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.186
She would have thrived
in college or art school.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.955
She's an amazing artist.

23:41.119 --> 23:42.792
They got her, Doug.

23:42.954 --> 23:44.797
The sleepwalkers, they got her.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.197
You told me no one's ever
meeting your parents.

23:47.359 --> 23:50.806
- Now I understand why. They're zombies.
- No. No. They're human.

23:50.962 --> 23:54.637
My mom makes dinner
for my dad every night.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.906
I don't think he knows how to
work the appliances in the kitchen.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.174
- What? Like the toaster?
- No, like the...

24:01.873 --> 24:05.184
...blender. I don't know. It's frustrating.

24:05.343 --> 24:09.883
And if the grandkids are home,
he'll just walk in, step over their toys.

24:10.048 --> 24:14.053
But I have never,
and I will never see my mom stop...

24:14.219 --> 24:18.190
...and step over their toys.
No. She will pick them up every time.

24:18.356 --> 24:20.734
Maybe your dad figures
he works all day.

24:20.892 --> 24:24.271
He's done his job,
and she is a homemaker.

24:24.429 --> 24:25.499
That's her job.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.770
But she didn't know that she had
the choice to do anything else.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.572
But Marybeth does.

24:31.002 --> 24:32.675
And she's choosing to marry him.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.978
I hate this. Okay?

24:37.576 --> 24:39.351
You know who I hate?

24:39.511 --> 24:40.546
Hoover.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.855
Let's take him down.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.564
<i>Okay-</i>

25:01.333 --> 25:03.142
Mr. Greenstone?

25:04.035 --> 25:06.208
Hi, I'm Denise.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.675
Twenty-six-inch waist?

25:11.209 --> 25:13.712
Hi. I'm sorry.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.225
Denise.

25:16.581 --> 25:17.924
Of course.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.198
Why don't we go upstairs?
I'll show you around.

25:24.422 --> 25:25.628
Um...

25:26.091 --> 25:27.365
Thank you.

25:30.729 --> 25:35.303
The piece I'm working on,
Bob Dylan's wife had a son, another kid.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.606
So I'm doing a brief on it.

25:37.769 --> 25:40.579
I could call Vital Records,
get his birth certificate.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.309
That would be good.

25:43.308 --> 25:47.188
- Who's up there?
- Oh, the editor, Finn.

25:47.345 --> 25:48.915
That's why we call it Finnland.

25:49.581 --> 25:51.254
His last name's Woodhouse.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.896
So if you're in trouble,
they call it the Woodshed.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.867
They're big into color-coding here.

26:02.961 --> 26:05.066
Um... Um...

26:05.664 --> 26:07.701
The paper.

26:13.004 --> 26:15.211
Blue means it's foreign.

26:17.042 --> 26:20.455
Pink means it's out of Washington.

26:20.612 --> 26:24.719
Yellow is anything domestic
but not out of D.C.

26:24.883 --> 26:29.832
And green is in-house, meaning here.

26:30.555 --> 26:33.536
- Oh, Cindy, where's Jane?
- Yeah?

26:33.959 --> 26:35.700
I don't know.

26:37.062 --> 26:41.738
Can you show our new researcher
Denise to personnel?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.277
Thank you.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.948
Yes?

26:57.382 --> 27:00.659
The Training Division received no money
for new Russian speakers.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.095
James McCall is the
head of the Anti-Soviet desk.

27:03.254 --> 27:07.600
And he is going to be
one very grumpy comrade.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.467
Yeah, we tried to get
a copy of the birth certificate...

27:10.629 --> 27:12.905
...of course, but we were unable to.

27:13.231 --> 27:19.273
Now I just need to confirm
they are spelling Jakob with a K.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.442
Thank you.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.853
Okay. Yeah. Goodbye.

27:27.245 --> 27:30.556
I thought the temp agency sent over
your new researcher this morning.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.292
Yeah, they did.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.987
Because it seems like
you're taking up valuable time...

27:35.153 --> 27:37.429
...doing tasks she could be doing.

27:37.589 --> 27:41.765
I'm not sure this one's a good fit either.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.338
Why? Did you ask her to do
something she couldn't?

27:44.496 --> 27:47.238
No, I just--

27:48.700 --> 27:52.773
The best reporters in the building,
I've found, are good at delegating.

27:52.937 --> 27:55.474
Otherwise, nothing
would ever get finished.

28:00.211 --> 28:02.657
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.420
Yeah, you too.

28:07.285 --> 28:09.526
- Talk.
- The Black Panthers...

28:09.688 --> 28:11.395
...are now public enemy number one.

28:13.558 --> 28:16.038
They're the bad guys
who need to be watched.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.640
- Right.
<i>- I'll</i> tell Finn.

28:19.097 --> 28:22.203
This gonna be a late night
or an early morning?

28:23.668 --> 28:28.515
As much as I would love to have
a late night with you, and I would...

28:28.873 --> 28:30.750
...can I come in early
tomorrow morning?

28:30.909 --> 28:33.082
Because I'd like to catch
the 5 p.m. bus home.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.622
- Oh, sure. Good.
- Thank you.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.384
Yes. Go.

28:39.918 --> 28:42.524
I'm gonna talk some sense into Marybeth.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.628
- What?
- Or you could give her your blessing.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.706
Actually, I can't because
that would be phony.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.740
Then tell her how to live her life.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.538
That's what somebody wants to hear
after getting engaged.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.703
I didn't ask for your advice.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.061
Sorry, put that away.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.431
- If Sam calls, tell him I'm on my way.
- Okay.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.299
Yeah. No.

29:25.463 --> 29:28.000
I'm less interested in who
the Bureau is investigating.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.045
I want to know how you're circumventing
the Freedom of Information Act...

29:31.202 --> 29:33.341
...so you can do
whatever the hell you want.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.355
Finn?

29:42.080 --> 29:43.991
I couldn't find you.

29:44.415 --> 29:46.554
I'm standing in a fishbowl
in the newsroom...

29:46.718 --> 29:49.961
...surrounded by professional observers.
Open your eyes, Angie.

29:50.121 --> 29:53.500
Talia's cooking tonight. I promised
I'd have you home in time for dinner.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.934
That sounds just lovely.

29:56.094 --> 29:58.301
I gave her my word.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.672
You insinuating your word
means more than mine?

30:03.835 --> 30:05.542
The girls can't wait to see you.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.752
I can't wait to see them.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.878
That's what I thought.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.953
Finn, this FBI story's
hotter than I thought.

30:20.218 --> 30:22.858
That Mona Lisa smile.
I mean, what are you thinking?

30:23.021 --> 30:26.628
That I have 28 more captions to write.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.070
Captions-snaptions.
What are you really thinking?

30:32.230 --> 30:37.407
I was thinking about how I hung out
with a bunch of groovy women last night.

30:37.802 --> 30:39.076
You must have fit right in.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.515
Can you turn a little to your left?

30:43.808 --> 30:45.151
A little more?

30:48.046 --> 30:49.525
Hold on one sec.

30:49.981 --> 30:53.121
<i>♪ Just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips

30:54.319 --> 30:58.267

31:26.551 --> 31:30.693
<i>♪ Someday we'll be together N'</i>

31:33.091 --> 31:36.402
I've been here less than a week,
and I'm already sick of the selection.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.837
Luckily, I'm not there yet.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.307
How's your story?

31:41.699 --> 31:46.011
Oh, it's pretty groundbreaking.

31:46.170 --> 31:50.448
Bob Dylan is naming his son Jakob
but with a K.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.281
Kacob.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.323
No, J-A-K-O-B.

31:57.482 --> 31:59.723
Ahh. That's better.

32:01.619 --> 32:04.623
Want a Mallo Cup with a C?

32:05.290 --> 32:07.099
No, thanks.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.436
Could you make some calls for me?

32:13.031 --> 32:14.977
I'd be happy to.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.913
- Hello.
- Hiya, doll.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.416
I'm hoping you can help me.

32:56.574 --> 32:59.054
I need to deliver something
to the chairman's office.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.723
Unless you have an appointment,
leave the item here.

33:01.879 --> 33:03.688
We'll send it up
with the next courier.

33:03.848 --> 33:06.692
- When does he go up?
- In the next hour or so.

33:10.621 --> 33:15.092
Discretion is of the utmost import.
I would never want to put the chairman...

33:15.259 --> 33:19.469
...in a compromising position
by making an appointment.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.071
I need to return something to him...

33:24.235 --> 33:27.409
...before his wife visits him
later this evening.

33:50.228 --> 33:51.639
Sam.

33:52.263 --> 33:53.867
Oh, thank God.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.273
- I couldn't remember anything that--
- Ahem.

33:56.634 --> 33:59.547
Hi. I'm With him.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.776
- Sam Rosenberg?
- Yes, sir. Chairman.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.921
Your secretary can take notes.
No tape recorder.

34:06.077 --> 34:07.647
- She--
- Of course.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.650
After you.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.960
My editor Finn Woodhouse
said you two go way back.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.501
We don't. He was mistaken.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.195
Oh, well, I thought he said--

34:24.362 --> 34:26.273
Never mind, never mind.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.540
They weren't lying.

34:31.702 --> 34:34.205
Being here is like coming to the dentist.

34:34.371 --> 34:35.442
Who's the patient?

34:45.650 --> 34:48.960
I feel like maybe we got
off on the wrong foot. A mulligan?

34:51.022 --> 34:53.331
Well, for starters,
how are you going spend...

34:53.491 --> 34:55.300
...your first few days off the clock?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.235
Any family plans?

34:57.395 --> 34:59.705
My wife is planning
a vacation to the beach.

34:59.864 --> 35:03.971
She claims she can get me to unwind
even if it kills her.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.982
Your children must be thrilled
to get some down time with you.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.417
I think that they are.

35:10.575 --> 35:13.681
But I think my wife and children know
where my priorities were.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.518
Which brings us to gold.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.685
Inflation is almost 6 percent.
The gold standard isn't working anymore.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.764
The dollar remains and will remain
convertible into gold.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.399
Do you really believe that...

35:24.555 --> 35:27.764
...a big, modern economy like ours
should depend on...

35:30.795 --> 35:32.433
...a shiny yellow rock?

35:32.597 --> 35:35.601
People's faith in the dollar
is based on their ability to turn it into gold.

35:35.766 --> 35:39.942
- It's been that way since ancient Greece.
- When Apollo controlled the sun.

35:40.404 --> 35:42.247
Sounds like magical thinking.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.517
Superstitions make us feel safe.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.849
That's good for the economy.

35:53.851 --> 35:56.388
- Finn is gonna flip out.
- How's this?

35:56.554 --> 35:58.465
Martin admitted he has
doubts about the office...

35:58.623 --> 36:01.160
...and said,
"Superstitions sometimes inform--"

36:01.325 --> 36:04.465
"Superstitions make us feel safe,
and that's good for the economy."

36:04.629 --> 36:05.699
That's what he said.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.175
- We gotta call Finn.
- Mm-hm.

36:11.536 --> 36:14.039
- Get in here.
- Sam.

36:14.205 --> 36:15.775
I'll need to read him the quotes.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.130
You're goddamn beautiful up close.

36:28.586 --> 36:29.997
<i>Finn Woodhouse's office.</i>

36:30.154 --> 36:32.828
- Hey, Angie, is Finn there? It's Sam.
- Just a minute, Sam.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.470
Back there felt like a bank heist.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.606
We're Bonnie and Clyde.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.173
Let's rob a bank.

36:39.330 --> 36:42.436
- Talk to me.
- Hey, I got him. Finn, I got him.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.739
- What'd he say?
- What wouldn't he say?

36:44.902 --> 36:47.576
- You were right. No sense of humor.
- Ha. <i>Give</i> me the skinny.

36:47.738 --> 36:50.480
Our fed chairman believes
in some black magic.

36:50.641 --> 36:53.588
- No kidding.
- Yeah, it's gonna write itself.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.620
Okay, boss, I'm headed home.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.288
Sam got an exclusive
with the fed chairman.

37:03.454 --> 37:04.762
Good.

37:05.423 --> 37:06.561
Goodnight.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.536
Hey.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.338
Listen.

37:16.133 --> 37:19.774
I would have appreciated a heads up
before you took the list over.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.213
Don't need your permission
to change up the list.

37:28.779 --> 37:30.781
Not permission.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.251
Courtesy.

37:35.353 --> 37:38.698
A courtesy, especially after
what happened last week...

37:38.856 --> 37:41.837
...when my Vietnam story
got bumped for the Altamont.

37:41.993 --> 37:46.408
I don't owe you more courtesy this week
because we ran another cover last week.

37:48.499 --> 37:51.742
Look, if we get too comfortable...

37:52.103 --> 37:54.276
...like with the Sunday Night List...

37:54.438 --> 37:57.317
...before we know it, you won't
have a table at the 21 Club.

37:57.475 --> 38:00.649
- I'm not here to dine.
- I know, and I appreciate that.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.916
But dining is part of the job.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.287
We got to stay in the mix.
We're no good anywhere else.

38:05.449 --> 38:08.658
We're opinionated sons of bitches
who get bored easily.

38:09.186 --> 38:10.995
What would we do without this place?

38:11.922 --> 38:14.926
So you were actually trying to help me.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.299
- Yes, I was.
- Yes, you were.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.031
I promised Talia.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.775
- It's like I have two wives.
- And no girlfriends.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.004
Oh, Jesus.

38:33.544 --> 38:37.014
- You're here late.
- Yeah. You too.

38:37.181 --> 38:39.127
Yeah, well, I'm leaving.

38:39.517 --> 38:43.021
- Do you need anything?
- Oh, no, I'm all right. Thank you.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.860
Are you sure?

38:52.863 --> 38:55.867
Ralph always has snacks.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.743
Well, you know all the secrets.

39:01.439 --> 39:02.975
I really do.

39:07.244 --> 39:08.723
Goodnight.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.881
Goodnight.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.831
Who's saying grace?

39:19.990 --> 39:21.367
Patti.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.095
Oh, let Marybeth do it.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.803
Why? Did you forget them all?

39:25.963 --> 39:28.307
No, I did not.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.108
Bless us, O Lord,
for these gifts we're about to receive...

39:32.269 --> 39:35.216
...from your bountiful hands.
In Jesus' name we pray.

39:35.439 --> 39:37.214
Amen.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.548
Have you heard
about where they're sending you?

39:39.710 --> 39:42.418
- Nothing yet. No.
- Can I get some ice in my water?

39:42.580 --> 39:44.753
- Yes.
- He can get his own ice, Mom.

39:44.915 --> 39:48.727
I got it. Hey, how many people
does that room at the Ramada hold?

39:48.886 --> 39:50.957
I went to a wedding there last fall.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.398
No more than 60, tops.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.265
My family alone
is about 100 Irish drunks.

39:58.129 --> 40:01.702
I have an aunt and uncle who renew
their vows as often as possible...

40:01.866 --> 40:04.244
-...just to throw a party.
-"Often."

40:04.969 --> 40:06.471
Hm?

40:11.075 --> 40:15.114
You said "off-ten". It's often.
You don't pronounce the T.

40:18.649 --> 40:22.859
Okay, Patti,
can I talk to you for a minute?

40:32.930 --> 40:34.739
I'm sorry I corrected Randy.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.305
You can be a real bitch.

40:38.469 --> 40:41.006
I have never heard you say that.

40:41.172 --> 40:44.585
Because you're never around.
He's a decent guy.

40:44.742 --> 40:48.121
Then why did it take you
45 minutes to say yes to him?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.486
Because I was crying.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.992
I was overwhelmed with happiness.

40:53.150 --> 40:56.154
- What is the rush? Are you pregnant?
- No.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.233
No, I just love him.

40:59.390 --> 41:02.860
For God's sake,
why can't you just be happy for me?

41:03.027 --> 41:05.507
Because I don't understand
what you're doing.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.601
I can't breathe here, Marybeth.

41:10.768 --> 41:14.682
Sometimes I actually cannot breathe.

41:14.839 --> 41:17.718
And then I think about you
cooking and cleaning for Randy...

41:17.875 --> 41:21.118
...for the rest of your life,
and it doesn't make sense to me.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.958
Remember when you
wanted to be a painter?

41:24.114 --> 41:26.025
And we were gonna move to Europe.

41:26.183 --> 41:32.031
And you were gonna stand on the
side of the road with an easel?

41:33.324 --> 41:36.430
This is what I want now.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.133
Don't worry about me.

41:39.296 --> 41:42.004
I'm living my dream too,
just like you are.

41:52.209 --> 41:56.055
My dream doesn't feel
like I imagined it would.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.322
Oh, no.

42:02.887 --> 42:05.060
Now I'm worried about you.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.724
What's wrong?

42:09.059 --> 42:10.868
I don't know.

42:23.140 --> 42:25.950
If you could start smoking,
that'd make my mooching easier.

42:26.110 --> 42:27.919
Charlie's always got some.

42:31.882 --> 42:34.556
Charlie's one tidy son of a bitch. Heh.

42:34.985 --> 42:38.023
Look at this. You could operate here.

42:38.188 --> 42:42.261
We should do appendectomies
right here on his desk as he copy edits.

42:45.162 --> 42:47.142
Why are you here so late?

42:48.399 --> 42:51.972
We're days away from printing.
Where's Robinson?

42:52.536 --> 42:55.642
She had to go home for a family thing.

42:58.609 --> 42:59.815
You two good?

43:02.079 --> 43:05.424
Depends on the day.
She's got a lot of fight in her.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.427
That sounds fun.
Wait, what does that mean?

43:08.586 --> 43:11.795
It means I don't know whether
I'm gonna get kissed or kicked.

43:12.189 --> 43:14.760
It could be worse. It could be boring.

43:16.493 --> 43:19.133
Boring's sounding
really good right now.

43:19.296 --> 43:22.573
Boring is what you marry.
Crazy is what you date.

43:23.334 --> 43:24.972
Wise words.

43:25.135 --> 43:27.172
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama, right?

43:28.672 --> 43:33.451
Patti's just trying to get her groove here.
She's a hippie astronaut on re-entry.

43:35.212 --> 43:36.850
What are you working on, man?

43:38.916 --> 43:40.327
This FBI story.

43:41.819 --> 43:47.497
It started out as a line item
on their budget, but it's got legs.

43:47.758 --> 43:50.602
Tell you what, man,
has anybody updated his obituary here?

43:50.761 --> 43:53.207
- Whose obituary?
- Hoover.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.004
Fucking son of a bitch
is about to go any day now, right?

43:56.166 --> 43:57.304
- How many years...
- I hope so.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.811
...has he been doing this? Jesus.

44:06.377 --> 44:08.482
Well, I'm gonna sleep like a baby.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.951
That dinner was delicious.

44:12.783 --> 44:15.992
The girls were so excited
to have you home for dinner.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.131
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.665
- How about you?
- Of course.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.498
I was pleasantly surprised
that Angie managed to get you--

44:23.661 --> 44:26.073
I made it home, okay?

44:40.944 --> 44:47.020
Okay, Patti, before I go off to war
I have one question for you...

44:47.184 --> 44:49.289
...and I want the God's honest truth.

44:49.453 --> 44:51.091
Cross my heart.

44:51.655 --> 44:54.431
July, 195s.

44:55.459 --> 44:57.837
Did you or did you not...

44:57.995 --> 45:02.341
...intentionally run into the curb
to throw me off the handlebars?

45:02.499 --> 45:06.037
Okay, I swear I do not remember...

45:06.203 --> 45:10.117
...but you were such a brat,
I might have done it on purpose.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.379
Are you scared?

45:17.381 --> 45:21.090
I'm gonna have a gun.
They better be scared.

45:22.119 --> 45:25.532
- I'd be scared.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

45:26.990 --> 45:28.594
Well...

45:29.293 --> 45:31.830
...you could get a IV-F deferment.

45:31.995 --> 45:34.407
At the magazine,
we were writing about these guys...

45:34.565 --> 45:38.012
...who would show up to induction centers
in clown suits or high on acid.

45:38.168 --> 45:40.774
Some were taking laxatives
before their physicals--

45:40.938 --> 45:43.441
I'm not gonna crap my pants
to get out of the draft.

45:44.508 --> 45:46.613
It was just a suggestion.

45:51.715 --> 45:53.126
Be good to her.

45:53.283 --> 45:57.095
I know that you will be.
I just need to say it.

45:59.723 --> 46:00.997
I will.

46:02.226 --> 46:04.672
I'd rather leave her a widow
who's taken care of...

46:04.828 --> 46:06.830
...than a girlfriend who isn't.

47:09.393 --> 47:13.569
Why don't you find out what happens
in chapter four tomorrow night?

47:13.730 --> 47:17.007
Lenny, I'm not feeling well.

47:17.167 --> 47:20.307
- I guarantee this will help you feel better.
- No, I don't--

47:20.470 --> 47:23.212
Ahem. I don't feel well.

47:25.709 --> 47:27.313

- Check.

48:18.495 --> 48:19.974
We good to go?

48:20.364 --> 48:21.604
_Hey, Doug.
- Doug.

48:21.765 --> 48:23.369
What just hap--?

48:23.533 --> 48:24.978
Come on.

48:33.443 --> 48:40.418
If I had to say goodbye to you
for a long time, or maybe forever, I--

48:41.785 --> 48:44.061
I couldn't handle it, Doug.

48:44.855 --> 48:49.361
And I am so sorry if I made you
feel like I don't appreciate you...

48:49.526 --> 48:50.834
...because I do.

48:53.730 --> 48:56.040
- Why do you have a lamp?

48:57.100 --> 49:00.411
I brought it back from my parents' house.
And I wasn't very convincing.

49:00.570 --> 49:02.675
She's still gonna marry him.

49:05.809 --> 49:07.311
What?

49:08.178 --> 49:09.782
I don't--

49:11.248 --> 49:13.194
- Man.
- What?

49:15.352 --> 49:17.559
What you said this morning...

49:17.721 --> 49:19.632
...how you're worried about
your sister...

49:19.790 --> 49:22.236
...being a servant to her husband
after she got married--

49:22.392 --> 49:26.499
- No, I said "being of service."
- I haven't stopped thinking about that.

49:28.398 --> 49:31.675
To me, you get married
because you want to be a team.

49:31.835 --> 49:35.977
And then, I don't know,
you figure the rest out together.

49:36.306 --> 49:37.808
And no one keeps score.

49:40.477 --> 49:44.050
But damn, Patti,
you drain all the fucking fun out of it.

49:44.481 --> 49:48.054
And then I'm to blame, or because
that sounds like a good deal to me...

49:48.218 --> 49:51.358
-...I'm a chump.
- I didn't say you were a chump.

49:56.059 --> 49:59.006
It's just, you're too complicated.

50:00.263 --> 50:02.971
You're too complicated for me, Patti.

50:06.370 --> 50:07.906
Right.

50:11.475 --> 50:13.250
And you're not up for the challenge...

50:13.410 --> 50:17.324
...because everything has
come easy for you.

50:20.550 --> 50:24.054
I'm not gonna keep trying
to convince you I'm a good guy.
