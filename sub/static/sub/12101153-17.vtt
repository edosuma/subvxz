00:01.392 --> 00:02.785
[Kara]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.828 --> 00:06.006
We're in a race against Nyxly
to find seven Totems

00:06.049 --> 00:09.096
before she can use them
to wipe us out of existence.

00:09.139 --> 00:13.404
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Courage,
Humanity, Truth, Destiny,
Love, Dreams and Hope.

00:13.448 --> 00:18.322
Since Nyxly arrived, I feel
like I have been one step
behind on everything.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.195
[William] Mysterious
alien known as Nyxly
remains at large.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.848
Are the Super Friends
prepared for this?

00:22.892 --> 00:25.329
-What are you talking about?
-I quit.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.592
[Nyxly] Supergirl just
destroyed the Hope Totem.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.420
Now the AllStone
will never be whole.

00:34.251 --> 00:39.213
-What are you?
-The key to your success.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.347
You're the key to my success?

00:43.391 --> 00:44.522
That's right.

00:53.575 --> 00:57.927
There you go.
All-in-one
and in working order.

00:57.970 --> 01:01.061
Also, I'm going to help you
get the AllStone.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.933
[laughs] Right.

01:03.976 --> 01:07.241
A man dressed
like a fancy banker

01:07.284 --> 01:11.941
is going to help me collect
seven magical Totems,

01:11.984 --> 01:16.076
one of which has already
been destroyed, by the way.

01:16.119 --> 01:21.777
[laughs] Yeah,
thanks for the assist
with the suit, but I'm good.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.954
Your own future consciousness
used the Dream Totem
to manifest me here.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.826
Surely, you trust
your own opinion of me.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.135
Good.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.095
Now, at the risk of
breaking the rules
of time travel,

01:35.138 --> 01:37.140
you need to know that I am
also from the future.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.448
-Well, technically,
I'm from this time--
-This is terribly boring.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.841
But in that future,
you and I are partners.

01:43.799 --> 01:44.887
And very good friends.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.367
I don't have any friends.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.499
You have one friend. Me.

01:48.543 --> 01:53.287
And together, we're two of
the most powerful
beings in the universe.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.680
That sounds like
I got the AllStone then.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.029
You did.

01:57.073 --> 02:00.032
But you didn't do it
in the right way.

02:00.076 --> 02:04.124
And that turned
out to be a grave mistake.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.953
As in fatal.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.825
-I died?
-But lucky for you,

02:09.868 --> 02:11.435
I was there.

02:11.479 --> 02:14.177
I preserved your consciousness
and came back here

02:14.221 --> 02:18.268
to help you succeed this time
in a way that will
make you invincible.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.183
Sorry I'm late.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.490
What is Lex Luthor doing here?

02:22.533 --> 02:25.057
You're Lex Luthor,

02:25.101 --> 02:29.018
the madman who sent Supergirl
to the Phantom Zone.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.889
That was some of my best work.

02:30.933 --> 02:34.241
Do you know what I really,
really loathe?

02:36.025 --> 02:39.811
Men who send women
to Phantom Zone.

02:39.855 --> 02:43.859
I know exactly what you are,
Lex Luthor.

02:43.902 --> 02:47.689
I've had to deal with men
like you my entire life.

02:47.732 --> 02:52.172
Arrogant,
narcissistic, manipulative.

02:52.215 --> 02:55.175
I can assure you we are not
and we will never be friends.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.402
[Nia] I can't believe it.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.796
CatCo's not gonna
be the same without you.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.798
Being a journalist
is part of who you are.

03:09.841 --> 03:13.236
I know, but with Nyxly
still out there,
I need to stay focused.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.196
She is the biggest threat
we have ever faced,

03:16.239 --> 03:18.894
and there's no reason for us
to always be one step behind.

03:18.937 --> 03:22.202
I want to draw Nyxly out
and catch her off guard.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.421
I like it. How do we do it?

03:26.945 --> 03:29.034
We have a plan.

03:29.078 --> 03:32.908
Nia, Lena, Kelly, to the lab.

03:35.302 --> 03:39.001
And I could use your help
on disarming strategies.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.611
Sure.

03:40.655 --> 03:43.919
Oh, gosh, I'm so glad
you two are here.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.703
Is Kelly around?

03:45.747 --> 03:47.270
She just went to the
lab with Brainy.
Why? What's up?

03:47.314 --> 03:49.751
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because this came in.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.056
[Supergirl gasps]

03:51.100 --> 03:51.883
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-[chuckling]

03:51.927 --> 03:53.450
[laughs]

03:53.494 --> 03:55.278
It's beautiful.
She's gonna love it.

03:55.322 --> 03:58.107
Uh, I forgot. Tomorrow night's
the big night, right?

03:58.150 --> 04:01.284
Yes, it is the anniversary
of the moment that I knew
I was in love with Kelly.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.026
Oh, I love this story.
Tell it, tell it.

04:04.069 --> 04:07.725
Okay. okay. So we're at Al's
and everybody's
there arguing about

04:07.769 --> 04:09.684
the greatest movie
villain of all time.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.903
-And she and I both
say at the same time--
-Hans Gruber.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.688
[chuckles] Yes.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.863
[all chuckle]

04:14.906 --> 04:16.691
Who knew Al's bar
was so romantic?

04:16.734 --> 04:19.694
Yeah, and it's going to be
even more so after I set it up.

04:19.737 --> 04:23.045
I'm thinking rose petals
on the tabletop
that we shared,

04:23.088 --> 04:25.308
and so many candles,
we'll probably break
the fire code.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.179
[both chuckle]

04:27.223 --> 04:29.617
Esme and I gonna take
all the supplies
there to Al's now,

04:29.660 --> 04:32.010
so that it's easy
to set up tomorrow.

04:32.054 --> 04:35.231
But, um, listen, I won't be
gone long, so I can be back
to help with Nyxly.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.886
Go, go. We will let you know
when we're ready.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.323
-Just go. Get out of here.
-Okay, okay, okay.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.152
[Supergirl] I'll call you
when we've got
our trap ready for Nyxly.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.246
[Alex] All right, Esme,
look at this. This is Al's.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.857
This is home to the best
karaoke night in the galaxy.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.077
You're gonna love it.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.949
As long as they
have mozzarella sticks.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.473
[chuckling] They do.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.996
Hey, Al!

05:01.039 --> 05:03.564
Hey, where you guys going
with all this stuff?

05:03.607 --> 05:06.697
Oh. Uh, I was just dropping off
some supplies
for tomorrow night.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.787
I have kind of a romantic
evening planned.

05:09.831 --> 05:12.094
Oh, Alex, I wish
you'd called ahead.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.052
We're booked
for a private event.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.663
You're booked?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.708
This place has never
been booked. [chuckles]

05:17.752 --> 05:20.363
If I had known that you
could be booked,
I would have done that.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.192
If you want to make it
another night,
I can easily--

05:23.235 --> 05:25.325
They can't do it another night.

05:25.368 --> 05:30.504
It has to be the night
Alex realized Kelly
was the love of her life.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.244
Don't you believe in love, Al?

05:33.376 --> 05:34.899
Wow.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.554
I'm really sorry, guys.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.426
I can't do it.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.256
[sighs]

05:46.433 --> 05:50.872
Oh, I missed you, boss.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.396
Now, why couldn't Nyxly
have given me
that kind of reception?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.311
So what if she rejected you?

05:55.355 --> 05:58.575
You're Lex Luthor.
And your timing
couldn't be better.

05:58.619 --> 06:01.535
Luthor Corp's returns
are through the roof
this quarter.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.624
Your mom gave me a board seat.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.281
And the way you left
everything covered,

06:09.325 --> 06:13.068
I think I'm the only one
who noticed you were gone.

06:13.111 --> 06:16.724
My point is, you
don't need that imp.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.857
See, the thing about
that imp is

06:19.901 --> 06:22.425
she's the only thing I want.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.516
Nyxly is the love of my life.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.693
I'm sorry, what?

06:29.737 --> 06:33.001
I know. Me? In love? [scoffs]

06:33.044 --> 06:34.742
I've always shouldered
this world alone.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.571
I've never known what it meant
to have a true partner.

06:37.614 --> 06:41.313
Who could possibly
match my wit, my flair,
my unfiltered genius?

06:41.357 --> 06:46.449
But when I met Nyxly, I knew.
She was the one.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.320
This was
supposed to be so easy.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.410
Come to this time,

06:50.453 --> 06:52.542
help Nyxly get the
Love Totem before the
Super Friends find it,

06:52.586 --> 06:55.415
and then return to the future
where my Nyxly
would still be alive.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.808
I can't save her if she
doesn't trust me.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.245
And she won't trust me
if she doesn't even like me.

07:00.289 --> 07:03.379
And if she doesn't like me now,
how will she love
me in the future?

07:04.772 --> 07:07.775
I did not understand
a word of that.

07:07.818 --> 07:14.825
But if she loved you before,
why don't you just
do that again?

07:14.869 --> 07:18.307
You big, beautiful idiot.
That's exactly
what I should do.

07:21.658 --> 07:24.618
Okay, I won't publish anything
until after you succeed.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.490
But how exactly
is this plan going to work?

07:27.534 --> 07:30.319
After conferring with
the Kryptonian witch hologram,

07:30.362 --> 07:33.148
we've deduced the next Totem
Nyxly will go after.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.279
The Love Totem.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.325
Using my magic,

07:36.368 --> 07:38.240
I'm going to mimic the energy
of the Totems we already have

07:38.283 --> 07:40.155
thereby creating
a fake Love Totem,

07:40.198 --> 07:42.592
which will be indistinguishable
from the real one.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.290
[Brainy] When Nyxly picks up on
that signature,
she'll come for the Totem,

07:45.334 --> 07:47.641
right to the secure
location we've chosen.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.991
Where our team
will be staked out
waiting to contain Nyxly

07:50.034 --> 07:52.602
the minute she shows her face.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.909
[Kelly] That kid is
really something,
isn't she?

07:54.952 --> 07:56.606
[Alex] Yeah, she is.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.652
We're very lucky.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.089
Yes, we are.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.874
You know, I knew
I wanted to be a mom,

08:03.918 --> 08:09.750
but I never imagined what it
would be like to be with
such an amazing partner.

08:09.793 --> 08:14.668
The world may throw us
a lot of curveballs,

08:14.711 --> 08:19.324
but the one thing that I am
certain about is us.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.717
[inhales sharply]

08:21.413 --> 08:22.893
[whooshes]

08:22.937 --> 08:24.068
[Kelly] It's showtime.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.737
[thuds]

08:45.612 --> 08:46.917
[Nyxly laughs]

08:46.961 --> 08:49.572
I see. It's a party then.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.313
[Lena chanting indistinctly]

09:00.452 --> 09:04.021
Ah! That gibberish
might be able to suppress
my Totem's powers,

09:04.065 --> 09:05.457
but you can't suppress this.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.112
[grunts]

09:08.765 --> 09:10.680
[grunting]

09:31.614 --> 09:32.572
[grunts]

09:34.269 --> 09:35.270
[yelps]

09:36.793 --> 09:37.881
Take her to containment.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.623
[explosion]

09:41.711 --> 09:43.147
[all groaning]

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
[grunting]

09:48.326 --> 09:49.240
No!

09:50.372 --> 09:51.460
[gasps]

09:51.503 --> 09:53.636
Well, this is a familiar scene.

09:54.985 --> 09:55.986
I had them.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.164
[groans]

10:05.343 --> 10:07.128
A trick Totem.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.477
You'll pay for that.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.348
Miss me, sis?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.009
What the hell was that?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.490
Your sister?

10:21.533 --> 10:24.275
How could she imitate a Totem
and fool my crystal ball?

10:24.319 --> 10:26.974
I can take a look
at that for you.
Make it so it can't be tricked.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.932
-I don't mind.
-Just because you waltzed in

10:28.976 --> 10:32.849
at a very convenient moment
doesn't mean that... Wait.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.637
How did you know where I was?

10:37.680 --> 10:38.638
[whirring]

10:40.944 --> 10:42.032
What is that?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.342
Is that a surveillance drone?

10:49.344 --> 10:52.303
Are you stalking me? Creep.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.870
I was protecting you.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.480
If I hadn't
shown up when I did,

10:55.524 --> 10:57.265
you would be powerless
in a prison right now.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.833
You claim to be on my side.

10:59.876 --> 11:03.010
But I am no closer
to finding my Totems.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.054
So get out!

11:05.055 --> 11:06.927
Uh, this is my home.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.059
Fine.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.715
[stammers]

11:12.759 --> 11:13.934
I love you.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.853
You're awake.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.593
-Thank God.
How are you feeling?
-[groans]

11:22.464 --> 11:23.813
I'm fine.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.467
I'm fine.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.598
Are you okay?

11:26.642 --> 11:28.513
[chuckles]

11:28.557 --> 11:30.341
I'm not the one that
just got blasted
by her greatest weakness.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.300
Lena, we just faced
off with Lex.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.480
I saw your decoy
Totem catch fire.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.742
What happened?

11:42.092 --> 11:46.662
I thought I was done
with all that venom
he brought into my life but...

11:46.706 --> 11:49.578
When he turned up yesterday
unexpected and unannounced...

11:51.667 --> 11:56.411
All that rage, it came...
came back all over me.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.283
Magic is so tied
to emotions and...

11:59.327 --> 12:03.157
If I feel out of
control or angry,
then my magic reflects that.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.159
Your rage started the fire?

12:06.638 --> 12:07.944
It's what happened
to my mother.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.166
She lost control
and people got hurt.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.385
I'm so sorry.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.605
Just while Lex is in play
and getting in my head,

12:16.648 --> 12:18.650
I think it's safer if
I don't do magic.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.392
-You know, God knows
who I could hurt.
-Yeah, I understand.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.612
And you bring so much more
to the team than magic.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.962
I mean, look how
you just healed me.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.181
Well, that was science.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.530
[chuckles softly]

12:28.573 --> 12:30.924
Lex Luthor is
working with Nyxly?

12:30.967 --> 12:34.144
Super Friends set a trap
for her, but it failed
when Lex showed up.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.929
They escaped together.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.234
Get me everything.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.888
Don't eat. Don't sleep.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.803
We're already down
one Pulitzer winner,

12:40.847 --> 12:42.326
so this is all on you.

12:42.370 --> 12:45.112
I want a full expose
on their nefarious plan

12:45.155 --> 12:47.288
before anyone else
gets wind of this.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.813
Andrea, believe me,

12:50.857 --> 12:53.294
no one wants to take down Lex
more than I do.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.078
But you remember the trial.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.037
We prejudged
without knowing all the facts,

12:57.080 --> 13:00.127
and Lex used that against us
to make us look like fools.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.520
We have to do this
the right way this time.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.522
[sighs] You mean the slow way.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.916
I need the story to put
us back on top.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.005
And I need to be certain
it was really Lex,

13:09.049 --> 13:11.312
and not just someone
in an image inducer.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.618
Then I'll figure out
what he's up to.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.925
And how are you
going to do that?

13:15.969 --> 13:18.536
Infiltrate the Luther
inner sanctum somehow.

13:19.581 --> 13:22.845
Get airtight proof he's back.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.934
Fine.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.284
But you have until
the end of today.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.592
I will run the story
of Lex Luthor's
return by tonight,

13:30.635 --> 13:32.899
with or without your proof.

13:39.035 --> 13:42.865
There's no sign of either Nyxly
or Lex's energy signatures.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.084
-This is bad.
-[elevator dings]

13:45.737 --> 13:47.609
[Alex] Hey, how
are you feeling?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.524
I'll be fine once we
find Lex and Nyxly.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.613
-Where's Nia?
-She's trying to dream
up their location.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.615
How did they even meet?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.269
We've been monitoring
Luthor Corp's chatter
in the underworld

13:55.312 --> 13:56.400
on Lex's activities.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.532
Nothing popped.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.186
We thought he was laying low.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.448
He was. Just...

14:01.492 --> 14:03.277
Just not in this century.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.627
The explosion Lex used,

14:05.670 --> 14:07.803
that tech is from
the 31st century.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.893
And now
Lex has his hands on it.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.417
Wait, are you saying
Lex went to the future?

14:13.461 --> 14:17.030
All that matters is that
two of the worst villains
we have ever faced

14:17.073 --> 14:18.422
are now working together,

14:18.466 --> 14:21.034
and we need something
big to stop them.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.950
We do have two weapons
we haven't considered
using yet.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.648
The Totems.

14:26.691 --> 14:31.696
We use our Totems
to take Lex
and Nyxly's courage.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.568
Or give them humanity.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.745
So if we do the reverse,
then it could
take our humanity.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.225
Alex is right.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.096
The Totem's consequences
are too unpredictable.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.533
I agree. It's too risky.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.797
And we always said
we were going to
protect the Totems.

14:45.841 --> 14:50.324
Maybe there's a way we can use
the Totems' energy,
but not as a weapon.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.805
At The Hague,
Nyxly used the Courage
Totem as a shield.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.503
Is there a way we can
replicate that?

14:55.546 --> 14:57.548
I can make a prototype.

14:57.592 --> 15:00.247
We'll have to
activate the Totem
to even see if it'll work.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.726
[Supergirl] J'onn
and I can do that.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.032
Brainy, you get working
on that shield.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.643
Alex, Kelly, you two
are on patrol.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.254
If Lex and Nyxly
are working together,

15:07.297 --> 15:09.430
this city is the most
vulnerable it's ever been.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.214
[whirring]

15:11.258 --> 15:13.738
Try reversing
the Totem's energy signatures.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.958
That should create a baseline
to repel the Dream Totem.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.221
She's right.
That should theoretically work.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.965
Sure. Yes, theoretically.

15:23.009 --> 15:26.664
What if Lex is using some
other technology
from the 31st century?

15:28.492 --> 15:30.886
Sprock. I should have known.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.542
The 31st century
is a technology nirvana.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.980
Of course Lex would
have been drawn
to that time. I just...

15:38.024 --> 15:40.330
I just wish we knew
what he was doing
in the future.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.810
What does the Legion say?

15:43.159 --> 15:45.814
Uh, I haven't contacted
them yet.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.294
[Nia] What?

15:47.337 --> 15:48.860
Brainy, they would know
what Lex is up to,

15:48.904 --> 15:50.645
and we need
all the information we can get.

15:50.688 --> 15:51.907
I know.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.735
But knowing things
about the future

15:53.778 --> 15:57.217
could have major consequences
on the space-time continuum.

16:00.089 --> 16:03.745
And the last time I acted on
information from the future,
I teamed up with Lex,

16:03.788 --> 16:06.008
betrayed my friends,
and nearly destroyed
half the world.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.705
I don't want to go down
that path again.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.708
I understand.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.624
All right. Well...

16:13.668 --> 16:16.758
I'll try to dream the location
of the Love Totem.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.631
But if you guys should
have need of my genius
again, give a whistle.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.029
[sighs]

16:28.204 --> 16:30.772
So if we activate these Totems,

16:30.815 --> 16:35.298
we should be able to use their
power to shield us from
the Dream Totem.

16:35.342 --> 16:39.172
We know the Humanity Totem
doesn't require
a test to activate it.

16:39.215 --> 16:42.131
It only affected Nyxly's
humanity because
she used it as a weapon.

16:42.175 --> 16:45.004
So that leaves
the Courage test.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.052
Let me try this time, Kara.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.619
You sure?

16:51.662 --> 16:54.709
I know exactly the moment
I lacked true courage.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.538
And while the thought
of going back
to that moment terrifies me...

16:59.409 --> 17:01.107
I think it's time.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.201
[sighs]

17:08.244 --> 17:10.464
I know that I can't
enter the gauntlet with you,

17:10.507 --> 17:12.596
but know that I will be
beside you the whole time.

17:16.731 --> 17:17.949
Kerr six.

17:21.692 --> 17:22.737
[growling]

17:25.218 --> 17:26.436
[screaming]

17:30.092 --> 17:31.050
No!

17:34.966 --> 17:37.665
No. Not this time.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.814
[gasps]

17:56.858 --> 17:59.556
[woman] You have
performed admirably.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.825
[whimpering]

18:13.179 --> 18:14.223
Kerr six.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.924
She was unimpressed
with my heroics.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.709
She balked at my
surveillance drones.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.625
You know, we used to have
matching tracking devices.

18:24.668 --> 18:27.018
She got them
for our anniversary.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.673
Said nothing was more romantic
than knowing where her
Lexie was at all times.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.937
It's so sweet to see
you like this,
you know, smitten.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.377
Smitten?

18:37.420 --> 18:39.248
If I ever hear you say
that word ever again,

18:39.292 --> 18:42.164
I'm going to implant
a nano sun eater
into your skull.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.167
[chuckles] Hey.
Why don't you, like, just...

18:45.211 --> 18:47.038
[imitates buzzing]
Brainwash her?

18:47.082 --> 18:48.823
"I love Lexie" style.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.173
Otis, my good man,
forcing women into loving you

18:51.217 --> 18:53.175
is the underpinning
of a toxic relationship.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.003
But you love toxic
relationships.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.874
Not as much as I love Nyxly.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.441
She has made me a changed man.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.530
And I have grown.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.619
Then why don't you
just tell her the truth
about your relationship?

19:02.663 --> 19:04.143
[laughs]

19:04.186 --> 19:06.667
You can't just tell
a woman how you feel.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.712
-It scares them off.
-[watch beeps]

19:08.756 --> 19:11.628
Oh, one hour until
the Super Idiots
find the Love Totem for real.

19:11.672 --> 19:14.196
You gonna crash their
party again, rescue Nyxly?

19:14.240 --> 19:17.417
No, I think this time
I'm just going to have
to let the girl come to me.

19:17.460 --> 19:22.073
But that does not mean
that I am just going
to let her fail.

19:25.642 --> 19:29.211
Hello, courier minion.
I need you to deliver

19:29.255 --> 19:32.562
some highly-sensitive intel
to Nyxly for me.

19:32.606 --> 19:37.088
But do not tell her
where you got it from.

19:37.915 --> 19:38.916
[Mitch] Mm-hmm.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.009
Oh, good. You're back.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.707
What happened to you?

19:46.750 --> 19:51.886
I was doing research
and a book fell on my face.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.801
Twice.

19:53.844 --> 19:57.979
But I did read
Tale of an Object
Infused with Love.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.503
You know, maybe
it's the Love Totem.

20:00.547 --> 20:03.811
Ines De Castro,
the Corpse bride of Portugal.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.901
The grave of famous
lovers in Portugal.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.209
Hmm.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.169
That's just what
the Mxy ball said.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.787
I know where the Love Totem is.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.631
Hey, guys, I see it.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.547
[whooshes]

20:44.591 --> 20:46.462
Oh, you didn't think
I'd let you just come in

20:46.506 --> 20:49.335
and take such a pretty
little bauble, did you?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.170
[grunts]

21:05.525 --> 21:06.917
[grunting]

21:08.049 --> 21:09.355
[laughs]

21:14.577 --> 21:15.926
[breathing heavily]

21:17.624 --> 21:18.886
-[growls]
-[gasps]

21:20.017 --> 21:21.497
[J'onn J'onzz] Supergirl!

21:21.541 --> 21:23.151
It's only a nightmare
from the Dream Totem.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.505
[gasping]

21:35.859 --> 21:37.165
Where did it go?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.039
-[grunting]
-Mitch, now.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.616
[Brainy] There's no sign
of the Totem.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.140
Even the energy
signature is gone.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.273
And I'll need
to fix this proto-trap

21:58.317 --> 22:00.928
if we have any hope
of finding Nyxly in the future.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.931
I just don't understand.
How could it just disappear?

22:03.974 --> 22:05.976
None of the other
Totems behaved this way.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.675
Actually, according to lore,
there are legends
of it disappearing

22:08.718 --> 22:11.068
and reappearing
throughout history.

22:11.112 --> 22:14.115
The Totem seems
to seek out love
and be repelled by hate.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.465
Well, Nyxly certainly wants it
for hateful reasons.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.687
[growls]

22:20.730 --> 22:23.211
I'm afraid that while
the combination
of the two Totems' energy

22:23.254 --> 22:25.387
is stronger than anything
I could've created
from scratch,

22:25.431 --> 22:27.389
defensively
it's a half-measure.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.349
A Totem's energy
is much more effective
when used as a weapon.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.267
[plays piano]

22:38.052 --> 22:40.707
Nyxly. What a surprise.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.404
The Love Totem disappeared.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.365
Do you know where it went?

22:46.408 --> 22:50.456
-Are you asking for my help?
-Yes.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.501
Will you help me?

22:52.545 --> 22:54.373
It would be my honor,
ma cherie.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.723
Uh, still...

22:56.766 --> 22:59.116
Never going to
be friends, you and I.

23:00.161 --> 23:01.815
This is strictly business.

23:01.858 --> 23:02.946
Hmm.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.125
Hey.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.866
Oh, man.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.564
I'm so sorry, I truly thought
that shield would work.

23:11.607 --> 23:14.131
I am so, so sorry
I wasn't there to protect you.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.481
It's not your fault.

23:15.524 --> 23:18.222
I was right there
with you in the decision.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.354
It's not just that.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.271
My courage test
took me right back

23:23.314 --> 23:25.839
to the moment that I failed
to protect everyone I love.

23:28.232 --> 23:31.105
Only this time in the gauntlet,

23:31.148 --> 23:33.542
I didn't let myself
be separated
from my daughters.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.023
I fought.

23:37.851 --> 23:38.982
Fought like hell.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.377
Fought to the death.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.513
But I still lost them.

23:47.556 --> 23:50.341
And when I saw you get hit
with that Dream Totem, I...

23:52.082 --> 23:54.041
I had that same feeling
all over again.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.566
I know what you mean.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.049
When the Dream Totem
hit me in my...

24:03.659 --> 24:07.446
My nightmare vision
was Phantom Zone phantoms.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.058
Hey, this is the first
time you've come

24:11.101 --> 24:13.887
face to face with Lex
since he sent you there.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.671
That can't have been easy.

24:15.715 --> 24:19.806
And now with Lex and Nyxly
working together, it's hard...

24:19.849 --> 24:21.851
It's really hard to find hope.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.941
You know, maybe...

24:24.985 --> 24:28.902
my test and your vision...

24:28.945 --> 24:31.513
is trying to teach us
that we're stronger
than our fears.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.517
I can't save my daughters.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.564
But I can save you.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.740
Everyone.

24:40.783 --> 24:41.915
My family now.

24:47.790 --> 24:51.490
I think we should use our
Totems as weapons
against Lex and Nyxly.

24:51.533 --> 24:56.407
The combination of Lex
and Nyxly is too dangerous,
and Brainy was right.

24:56.451 --> 25:00.847
If we're going to win this war,
we need to use
all our firepower.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.544
I agree.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.373
But if you use the
Humanity Totem...

25:05.416 --> 25:08.419
Kara, you could lose
your humanity.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.510
But that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.469
And I think I know of a way
I can protect myself.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.516
You want me to use my magic
with Lex still around?

25:17.559 --> 25:21.563
Just to protect me
from the blowback
of the Humanity Totem.

25:21.607 --> 25:25.088
If I use it to give
Lex and Nyxly more humanity,

25:25.132 --> 25:27.700
I run the risk of losing
some of my own.

25:27.743 --> 25:31.530
Unless your magic
can protect me.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.838
Kara, I told you that my magic
can't be trusted
with Lex involved.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.579
When the Dream Totem hit me...

25:38.928 --> 25:40.364
it sent me into a nightmare.

25:41.627 --> 25:42.845
Where I was...

25:44.064 --> 25:45.979
surrounded by phantoms.

25:46.022 --> 25:49.025
And I was becoming
a phantom too.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.505
Cold.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.420
Emotionless.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.293
But then I realized...

25:56.337 --> 26:01.081
this nightmare is showing me
what I could become
without my humanity.

26:01.124 --> 26:05.128
And I thought that nightmare
would make me even
more afraid to use the Totem,

26:05.172 --> 26:06.216
but you know what?

26:07.653 --> 26:10.264
I'm not afraid to become
that phantom.

26:10.307 --> 26:14.573
I've been letting Nyxly
convince me
that if I stoop to her level,

26:14.616 --> 26:16.618
I'd become a
monster just like her.
But you know what?

26:16.662 --> 26:18.577
I have something she doesn't.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.840
This team, this family.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.756
And no matter what happens,

26:23.799 --> 26:26.889
I know you all will pull me
back from the edge,

26:26.933 --> 26:30.284
which is why I need
your help now.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.634
If I use my magic,
I could end up hurting you.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.941
You've been afraid to become
the worst version of yourself

26:34.984 --> 26:38.771
because for so long,
Lex was the only
family you had.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.687
He wanted you to be a monster,
and there was no one around

26:41.730 --> 26:44.298
to pull you back
when you went too far.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.605
But he's not your
family anymore.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.518
We are.

26:48.563 --> 26:49.825
Focus on the good.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.436
On your real family.

26:53.524 --> 26:56.789
Use that to fuel your magic...

26:56.832 --> 26:58.312
and you won't lose control.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.578
[door opens]

27:05.232 --> 27:06.842
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.888
Wait a minute.
What are you still doing here?

27:08.931 --> 27:11.368
Shouldn't you be at Al's Bar
getting all betrothed?

27:11.412 --> 27:12.369
[sighs]

27:12.413 --> 27:14.284
Al's was booked.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.505
I know. I know.

27:17.548 --> 27:23.076
And with Nyxly and Lex
out there, I don't know
if it's even the right time.

27:23.119 --> 27:26.340
So you're just gonna
postpone your proposal?

27:26.383 --> 27:28.037
Just like that?

27:28.081 --> 27:32.172
You may not know this,
but Kelly was engaged before.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.696
And so was I.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.352
And the last time
that I proposed,
it was totally spontaneous.

27:38.395 --> 27:43.662
I just jumped right in there
with no planning
and it just felt right.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.533
But...

27:45.576 --> 27:48.144
That relationship just...

27:49.755 --> 27:50.886
ended.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.542
Alex.

27:54.585 --> 27:58.546
You and Kelly have
one of the strongest
relationships I've ever seen.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.244
And if I know one
thing, it's this.

28:01.288 --> 28:04.726
When Lex Luther is around,
tomorrow is never promised.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.947
So if you have love to give...

28:09.165 --> 28:11.211
give it now.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.082
You may not get another chance.

28:16.782 --> 28:20.742
You really think you fixed
my crystal ball without magic?

28:20.786 --> 28:24.572
This is technology
from the future.

28:24.615 --> 28:29.142
With your own future self's
help, I was able to blend
technology and magic.

28:33.929 --> 28:37.890
-I helped you build that?
-I told you.
We were quite a pair.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.935
We made many beautiful
things together.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.763
What was I like...

28:41.807 --> 28:45.201
will I be like...
after I got the AllStone?

28:45.245 --> 28:47.290
Did I get my revenge?

28:47.334 --> 28:49.945
Oh, yes.

28:49.989 --> 28:53.993
I didn't know you then,
but it must have been
magnificent.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.864
Every time you talked about it,
you glowed.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.608
Maybe...

29:00.651 --> 29:07.441
That's why you were more
responsive to befriending
an arrogant man such as me.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.531
You no longer
carried the weight
of you unfulfilled vengeance.

29:14.100 --> 29:14.970
[gasps]

29:18.800 --> 29:20.889
I know where the Love Totem is.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.288
Okay, Al, I know that you said
this place was booked but--

29:28.331 --> 29:29.855
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

29:32.683 --> 29:35.295
Wait, you're the one
who booked it?

29:35.338 --> 29:38.602
-How did you even do this?
-Uh, I had some help.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.995
William was in on it.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.824
You two had the
same plan. It's fate!

29:42.868 --> 29:44.434
[laughter]

29:44.478 --> 29:45.522
Oh, my gosh.

29:47.524 --> 29:48.874
Alex.

29:48.917 --> 29:52.965
I wanted to surprise you
tonight because...

29:53.008 --> 29:57.708
It's the anniversary
of the first time
I realized I loved you.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.103
I love everything about you.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.671
Your passion.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.892
And your compassion.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.372
The way that you fight
for people that you love.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.853
But you never
let it harden you.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.508
The way that you
make space for me

30:14.551 --> 30:16.815
to be the truest
version of myself.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.297
You are more than my love.

30:23.038 --> 30:25.824
You are my perfect match.

30:25.867 --> 30:30.916
And when I'm with you,
my soul feels complete.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.048
[exhales]

30:36.747 --> 30:38.837
Alex Danvers, will you--

30:38.880 --> 30:40.839
No, no no. Wait, wait, wait.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.318
Wait. Wait.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.843
Look, I wanted
to be the first to do this.

30:49.717 --> 30:50.849
Oh, crap.

30:50.892 --> 30:51.937
What is that?

30:53.025 --> 30:54.374
That's the Love Totem.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.244
[whooshes]

30:59.683 --> 31:01.120
Supergirl!

31:01.903 --> 31:02.773
[grunting]

31:07.474 --> 31:08.518
Get her out of here.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.432
Let's go.

31:19.486 --> 31:20.530
[screams]

31:23.751 --> 31:25.318
Brainy, how's Lena doing?

31:25.361 --> 31:27.363
[chanting]

31:29.061 --> 31:31.237
[Brainy] She's getting
her emotions in check.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.072
All right, Lena.

31:40.115 --> 31:40.986
It's your turn.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.248
You got this.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.640
[chanting]

31:49.820 --> 31:50.865
[crackling]

31:54.825 --> 31:55.696
Now.

31:57.654 --> 31:58.655
[yelps]

32:03.008 --> 32:04.357
Why?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.576
Why are you making
all this chaos?

32:06.620 --> 32:07.926
It's working!

32:11.364 --> 32:12.495
[groans]

32:18.197 --> 32:20.373
No.

32:20.416 --> 32:26.945
I won't let you sway me
from my mission again.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.556
[grunts]

32:30.296 --> 32:31.645
[grunts]

32:31.688 --> 32:33.212
J'onn, I need you!

32:33.255 --> 32:34.953
[grunting]

32:40.610 --> 32:41.872
[groaning]

32:48.967 --> 32:50.751
Looks like I got here
just in time.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.322
No!

32:56.365 --> 32:57.410
No!

33:13.121 --> 33:16.168
I hit the Love Totem
with all the energy
of the Courage Totem.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.475
Do you think it still works?

33:19.519 --> 33:22.261
It's not emitting any
fifth-dimension energy
like it should be.

33:22.304 --> 33:26.047
And, you know, it turned black.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.050
If the Love Totem is destroyed,

33:29.094 --> 33:32.358
does that mean all the love
in the world is diminished?

33:32.401 --> 33:36.884
You know, I don't think
all the love in the world
has been diminished.

33:36.927 --> 33:38.494
You want to know why,

33:38.538 --> 33:41.802
out of all the pockets
in all of the world,

33:41.845 --> 33:45.675
that Totem appeared in mine?

33:45.719 --> 33:51.246
It's because of how much love
I feel for each one of you.

33:51.290 --> 33:55.250
And it doesn't go away
just because
that thing turned black.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.383
It's still here.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.776
And I know it because
I can feel it.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.084
It's...

34:03.128 --> 34:04.912
It's the truest love.

34:08.742 --> 34:09.656
Come here.

34:14.269 --> 34:18.230
Earlier today, I was so anxious

34:18.273 --> 34:21.929
because I convinced myself
that if you and I didn't have
the perfect proposal,

34:21.972 --> 34:25.106
that our future
would be doomed.

34:25.150 --> 34:30.546
And thinking about that,
that sounds
absolutely ridiculous.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.593
From the moment that we met...

34:33.636 --> 34:36.552
you and I have been
surrounded by chaos.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.294
From blackouts to black holes.

34:39.338 --> 34:41.601
We fought monsters.

34:41.644 --> 34:44.821
I mean, God, we even loved
each other through
the end of the universe.

34:46.432 --> 34:48.129
And not even that
could tear us apart.

34:50.349 --> 34:51.350
Kelly Olsen...

34:53.178 --> 34:54.788
I love you

34:54.831 --> 34:58.966
with every fiber of my being.

34:59.009 --> 35:03.927
You are the person that I
want to watch Die Hard
with for the rest of my life.

35:03.971 --> 35:04.885
[chuckles]

35:06.756 --> 35:08.106
Will you marry me?

35:10.020 --> 35:11.587
Yes.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.285
Yes. Of course, yes.

35:15.852 --> 35:16.853
Yes.

35:21.597 --> 35:22.729
[laughs]

35:27.212 --> 35:28.517
[laughter]

35:28.561 --> 35:30.737
-Oh, my God! Come on!
-[cheering]

35:32.608 --> 35:34.175
We're getting married!

35:34.219 --> 35:35.176
Oh, my God.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.357
[groans]

35:42.401 --> 35:44.098
Don't worry.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.753
This will remove all
of the Totem's energy from you.

35:48.581 --> 35:49.451
There.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.975
All done.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.717
Your emotions
are once again your own.

36:02.247 --> 36:05.641
You had a clean shot
at the Love Totem.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.904
And you
abandoned it to save me.

36:08.601 --> 36:09.732
Why?

36:10.820 --> 36:12.561
Did I? I must not have seen it.

36:12.605 --> 36:13.736
Tell me the truth.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.999
What do you want from me?

36:21.396 --> 36:22.397
You want the truth?

36:24.007 --> 36:26.575
The truth is I love you.

36:26.619 --> 36:30.840
I love you so much
that when you... died,

36:30.884 --> 36:34.235
part of me died too.

36:34.279 --> 36:37.934
And you don't understand.
I don't love anybody.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.458
In fact, I hate everyone.

36:41.590 --> 36:46.204
From a very young age,
I knew I would move
through this world alone,

36:46.247 --> 36:48.423
riding that solitary
high-speed train

36:48.467 --> 36:51.209
towards progress and greatness
all by myself.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.386
But there you were.

36:54.429 --> 36:59.086
This radiant, powerful being,

36:59.129 --> 37:02.742
vibrating with your
own brilliant madness.

37:02.785 --> 37:06.485
I never thought anyone
could match
my ambition, my genius, but...

37:07.921 --> 37:10.053
Then I met you.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.534
In all the timelines,
in all the dimensions,

37:12.578 --> 37:15.581
in all the universes, you...

37:15.624 --> 37:17.931
were the only one that
could match me.

37:17.974 --> 37:22.152
But of course, you don't know
any of this, 'cause
you weren't there.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.243
Yet.

37:25.286 --> 37:28.289
You haven't met me yet,
and I sound insane.

37:31.727 --> 37:37.777
No one has ever
selflessly sacrificed
something for me

37:37.820 --> 37:39.169
like you did tonight.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.955
So, no, I wasn't there.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.349
But...

37:44.392 --> 37:48.744
If what you say is true
and you really are here

37:48.788 --> 37:51.399
to help me succeed...

37:54.097 --> 37:57.013
Well, I don't see
why we can't be friends.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.321
[upbeat music playing]

38:01.757 --> 38:04.020
-Look at that.
-Top it off.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.109
[stammers] You know,
I never said drinking
was allowed in here,

38:06.153 --> 38:07.546
-but I think it's a good idea.
-Well...

38:07.589 --> 38:08.590
[laughter]

38:11.201 --> 38:13.160
Kelly! Welcome to the family.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.640
Aww, thank you.

38:14.683 --> 38:15.858
-[clears throat]
-Oh.

38:15.902 --> 38:18.078
Oh, excuse me.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.732
Would you like
a Shirley Temple, Esme?

38:20.950 --> 38:21.995
[chuckling] Okay.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.868
[indistinct chattering]

38:32.397 --> 38:33.223
Excuse me.

38:38.054 --> 38:42.450
So for engagement presents,
I'm thinking
matching motorcycles.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.191
What say you?

38:45.018 --> 38:46.019
Sure.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.196
Hey, what is it?

38:50.415 --> 38:52.286
Lex's behavior tonight...

38:53.418 --> 38:56.159
It was irrational.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.859
He had the Love
Totem in his grasp,
and yet...

38:59.902 --> 39:03.384
Yet he portaled
away without it. Why?

39:03.428 --> 39:06.431
I try not to get too much into
the psyche of Lex Luther.

39:06.474 --> 39:09.956
Something changed
him in the future.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.784
We need to know more.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.742
I don't want to make
the same mistakes of the past.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.226
Well, you won't.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.271
'Cause this time you
don't have secrets.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.232
This time, you have me

39:25.275 --> 39:27.669
and the rest of the team,
and we trust you.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.237
You need to call the future.

39:33.588 --> 39:34.589
Okay.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.985
[chuckles]

39:39.028 --> 39:41.030
There you are.
You almost missed the party.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.642
I just wanted to take a minute
to clean up downstairs.

39:43.685 --> 39:45.078
[sighs]

39:45.121 --> 39:48.473
Uh, thank you for
taking that risk today.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.779
You protected me
from losing a part of myself.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.956
You always do.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.916
Well, you protected
everyone else.

39:56.959 --> 40:01.094
Besides, it should be
me thanking you
for pushing me to use my magic.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.922
'Cause I now know for sure...

40:04.619 --> 40:06.926
I really am free of Lex.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.362
I will drink to that.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.407
-[chuckles]
-[glass clinking]

40:12.758 --> 40:13.846
[cell phone ringing]

40:17.458 --> 40:18.372
[cat meows]

40:23.986 --> 40:25.074
Thanks for meeting me.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.905
You've reached William's phone.
Please leave a message.

40:29.949 --> 40:33.169
William, you promised
you'd deliver,
and you didn't.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.563
If you're not going
to get me what I need,

40:35.607 --> 40:36.999
I'll get it myself.

40:42.178 --> 40:43.615
[whooshes]

41:09.510 --> 41:11.860
Thank you for fixing this.

41:11.904 --> 41:15.647
But what does it matter
if we find the rest
of the Totems?

41:15.690 --> 41:19.694
I can't build the AllStone
without the Hope Totem.

41:19.738 --> 41:20.695
You mean...

41:22.044 --> 41:25.004
This Hope Totem?

41:25.047 --> 41:27.659
I thought Supergirl
destroyed that.

41:27.702 --> 41:31.271
The thing about
these Totems is,
you can destroy the shell,

41:31.314 --> 41:33.708
but the essence
flows into something new.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.059
Oh. Also, the Love Totem...

41:38.713 --> 41:41.107
The Super Friends destroyed it.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.283
[indistinct chattering]

41:43.326 --> 41:44.893
[Nyxly] So you think that one
will reconstitute
itself as well?

41:46.242 --> 41:47.374
[Lex] I know it will.
