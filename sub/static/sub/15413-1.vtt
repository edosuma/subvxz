00:09.259 --> 00:12.103
If I had been really smart,

00:12.679 --> 00:14.248
I would have died when I was a kid.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.646
I mean, that would have been
a really smart thing to do.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.836
You know what saved me?

00:18.936 --> 00:19.936
Balling.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.571
God talks to me.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.366
He talks to me
whenever there's his work to be done.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.872
I'm his chosen instrument.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.393
I set fire to my apartment once.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.837
They got me out but my cat died.

00:37.329 --> 00:41.275
I feel dead. Like I'm not here.

00:41.375 --> 00:48.224
I feel less here than I ever
have in my life before.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.826
And that's why I came to see you, Doctor.

00:50.926 --> 00:55.602
Something is drastically wrong
and I don't know if I can solve it.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.270
You want me to park it for you,
Dr. Stevens?

04:47.370 --> 04:48.897
Yes, thank you, Charlie.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.107
Is that it for today?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.459
Yes, thank God.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.966
Looks like it could use a wash.

05:58.275 --> 06:03.054
The greatest thing is the security
I feel when I'm in bed with a man.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.807
When we have sex,

06:05.907 --> 06:08.786
I feel successful,

06:10.495 --> 06:12.839
beautiful. I feel normal.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.028
Then I go home to my wife, my kids.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.721
And I look at them,

06:21.506 --> 06:23.804
and I face what I really am.

06:25.135 --> 06:29.106
My two daughters, they adore me.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.810
And I sit there,

06:35.645 --> 06:37.363
and all I can think

06:38.857 --> 06:42.135
is that they're looking at a monster,

06:42.235 --> 06:45.114
because that's what I really am.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.994
And I swear to myself
that I'm never going to do it again.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.257
Until I have to...

06:59.794 --> 07:02.843
Oh, Christ, dear Christ!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.855
Hi. Can I see some of your roses?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.148
Well, those are red, they're $15.95.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.943
But it's such a bad day,
I can let you have two dozen for $20.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.886
All right, that's fine, yeah.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.210
Another dozen just like these?

08:24.087 --> 08:27.073
We live in an amazing house

08:27.173 --> 08:31.428
overlooking the lake
with a long drive leading up to it.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.166
My husband bought it for me.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.984
He's very generous.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.462
He loves me.

08:40.562 --> 08:44.507
I feel I'm being disloyal
to him even being here.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.484
Do you have to have that thing on?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.159
No.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.869
We can switch it off.

08:52.449 --> 08:56.061
It's only there to remind me afterwards.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.189
What you must remember,
Mrs. Blake, is whatever you tell me

08:59.289 --> 09:01.650
is just between you and me,
it goes no further.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.693
It's just that I'm...

09:03.793 --> 09:05.111
I'm scared.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.805
Most people that sit in that chair
feel the same way.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.634
So, don't force it.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.390
Okay?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.022
What does your husband do?

09:17.307 --> 09:19.981
He builds condominiums. He's...

09:21.603 --> 09:23.546
He builds condominiums.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.648
Maybe he built the one I live in.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.359
Is this your first marriage?

09:27.859 --> 09:29.010
Yes.

09:29.110 --> 09:34.849
And is it everything
you thought it would be?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.309
I told you, I...

09:36.409 --> 09:39.229
I love my husband and he loves me.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.607
Yes, of course you did. So we're...

09:42.707 --> 09:45.711
We are not looking
for anything ordinary then, are we?

09:46.503 --> 09:47.720
What does that mean?

09:48.838 --> 09:49.906
Nothing sinister,

09:50.006 --> 09:55.286
just that we can rule out
the usual causes of marital troubles,

09:55.386 --> 10:01.167
sexual incompatibility,
unfaithfulness, social diseases.

10:01.267 --> 10:06.089
Now the reason you came
to consult with me was something deeper.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.693
Tell me, does your husband
know you've come to see me?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.429
No.

10:12.529 --> 10:17.706
Would the reason for that be
that the problem is his, not yours?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.709
People can imagine things, can't they?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.164
Frequently.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.838
Things that aren't necessarily true?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.339
Yes.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.390
I'll think about it some more then and

10:34.175 --> 10:36.223
I'll contact you again if I need to.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.143
I have to go. I'll call you later.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.495
Can I help you, gentlemen?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.664
Yeah, we'd like to see Dr. Stevens.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.317
May I tell him what for?

11:07.417 --> 11:10.136
Well, in a manner of speaking, no.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.169
In a manner of speaking, no. I like it.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.545
Why don't you write it down?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.147
I'm gonna use it.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.134
- Hey, Mac?
- What?

11:33.234 --> 11:35.637
What do you think the tab
is for a joint like this?

11:35.737 --> 11:37.430
I don't know.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.643
I guess it costs about $50
to come through this door.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.521
Well, plenty of people
must think it's worth it.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.397
He's got his book all full.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.733
Well, that's because the Surgeon General

11:48.833 --> 11:51.361
hasn't determined shrinks
as being bad for your health.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.364
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Would you care to step in, please?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.199
Dr. Stevens will see you now.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.367
Okay. Thank you.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.310
You're welcome. This way please.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.062
Excuse me.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.882
Doctor, my name is Lieutenant
McGreavy. I'm from Homicide.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.343
And this is Detective Angeli.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.571
Well, gentlemen, won't you sit down?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.411
McGreavy.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.819
We've met before, haven't we?

12:24.077 --> 12:28.127
We certainly have. As a matter of fact,
we met in court, in the Zifrin case.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.796
Zifrin.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.089
Yes, I remember.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.671
But you were in a wheelchair then,
you'd been shot.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.869
I was in a wheelchair, and I had been shot
and my partner had been killed.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.955
And your expert testimony
helped screw up justice

12:44.055 --> 12:46.604
as far as the Zifrin case was concerned.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.610
I wouldn't say that.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.188
He was committed as insane.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.257
Is he being released?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.009
Is that why you've come to see me?

12:56.109 --> 12:59.470
He's doing very well.
He gets three square meals a day,

12:59.570 --> 13:02.244
which is more
than I can say for my partner's wife.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.040
But that's not why we're here, sir.

13:09.205 --> 13:14.587
We were wondering if it was
possible for you to identify this.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.489
It looks like one I have.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.685
It is. Well, I mean, at least it
has your name stenciled inside of it.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.455
We were just wondering
how it got out of your possession.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.290
Well, there's no mystery.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.150
It was raining earlier
and one of my patients

13:29.225 --> 13:31.336
hadn't brought his coat,
so I let him borrow that.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.129
What's this all about?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.422
Well, I'll tell you what it's all about.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.368
Somebody stuck a knife through it
while your ex-patient was still wearing it.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.165
Are you telling me
that Mr. Boyd has been murdered?

13:51.414 --> 13:54.943
Well, if he wasn't, it will go in the
Guinness Book of Records as a suicide first.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.421
Oh, my God.

13:57.628 --> 14:01.007
Now, could you tell us
approximately what time he left here?

14:03.801 --> 14:10.434
Well, his appointment was at 11:30,
and the sessions usually last an hour.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.942
But he was upset today so we cut it short.

14:15.980 --> 14:20.301
I would imagine he left here around 12:10.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.448
What upset him?

14:22.028 --> 14:27.517
In simple terms,
he was a bisexual, married,

14:27.617 --> 14:29.119
with two children,

14:30.036 --> 14:33.231
and trying desperately to come
to terms with his homosexuality.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.129
He was a fag with a family.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.904
That is your description, not mine.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.408
Do you have any idea of his gay contacts?

14:43.508 --> 14:44.805
No. Why would I?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.328
Where was Mr. Boyd murdered?

14:47.428 --> 14:50.248
It was a couple of blocks from here.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.500
Happened about 12:20,

14:52.600 --> 14:55.128
but there was no robbery intended
or anything like that.

14:55.228 --> 15:00.109
By that I mean his wallet was still intact
and had a couple of hundred dollars in it.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.987
Now, there's a question
that I'd like to ask you.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.724
Was he an obvious gay or was he butch?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.326
No, far from it.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.038
This is awful.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.482
I keep thinking of
his poor wife and children.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.084
Did she know about him?

15:20.253 --> 15:23.406
No, I don't think so.
Has she been told yet?

15:23.506 --> 15:24.803
No.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.043
Well, then I'd like to do it.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.454
I think I could
possibly break the news more gently.

15:29.554 --> 15:33.124
I'm sure because I know that
we cops, we jump in with both feet...

15:33.224 --> 15:35.251
No, I did not mean that.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.879
Then let me ask you a question,
and I'm gonna jump in with both feet.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.323
Do any of your patients, do they love you?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.842
What the hell does that mean?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.095
That means, Doctor, translating from the
French, do they have the hots for you?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.432
After all, you sit there and you listen
to them, listen to all their troubles

15:49.532 --> 15:51.768
and you hold their hand
and you wipe their eyes

15:51.868 --> 15:53.728
and one day a fag walks in here you see...

15:53.828 --> 15:56.773
- No, a patient walks in here...
- I beg your pardon!

15:56.873 --> 16:01.128
A patient, a patient walks in. Yes.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.364
A patient walks in
who can't make up his mind

16:04.464 --> 16:06.699
whether he likes boys
or whether he likes girls!

16:06.799 --> 16:08.479
Now isn't it possible
that this Mr. Boyd...

16:08.551 --> 16:11.471
Now, I don't wanna shock you with the
terminology I'm gonna come out with,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.706
but this Mr. Boyd gets a hard-on for you

16:13.806 --> 16:16.959
and you being normal,
of course, you reject him

16:17.059 --> 16:18.836
and now he threatens you with blackmail,

16:18.936 --> 16:24.467
so it's your word against his
and we have the beginning of a motive.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.637
You're very lucky
to go around with a colleague

16:27.737 --> 16:30.640
with such an overdeveloped sense of humor.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.643
Oh, yeah,
he's a barrel of laughs on a murder case.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.416
Don't get too cute, Doctor.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.856
I don't feel "cute," as you put it.

16:38.956 --> 16:43.403
Nor do I feel that I have to stand here
and listen to your innuendo.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.822
If a patient of mine has been murdered,

16:45.922 --> 16:47.740
then I shall answer
any legitimate questions

16:47.840 --> 16:49.492
and do anything I can to help.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.286
But do not push your luck, Lieutenant!

16:52.386 --> 16:55.081
Just give us the files on Boyd.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.416
No way.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.126
I can get a court order.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.899
Then I suggest you get it!

17:00.978 --> 17:06.092
From what you've told me, he was knifed
in the street by some random maniac

17:06.192 --> 17:08.176
and I suggest you start looking for him.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.262
You're quite right.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.513
I don't know
what we're doing in your office.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.392
We should be out in the streets looking for
him because you're the expert on maniacs!

17:14.492 --> 17:16.961
You know how to protect them,
like you protected Zifrin!

17:19.413 --> 17:22.007
So now we're getting down
to the bottom line, aren't we?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.359
No.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.695
I do not deal in maniacs.

17:26.796 --> 17:31.033
I practice a form of medicine
for people who need mental help

17:31.133 --> 17:34.537
and from what I've seen,
you could use a little yourself.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.707
So, you get your court order, Lieutenant,

17:37.807 --> 17:41.627
and I shall go and get myself a lawyer
if I think it's necessary.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.400
You can use this way out.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.454
- What time is the Sox game tonight?
- 7:30.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.080
Well, I'm gonna miss it.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.352
Tape it for me, will you?

18:20.391 --> 18:21.584
Mary.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.170
Will you have George call his
wife as soon as he comes in?

18:24.270 --> 18:27.882
It's very important. Okay. Thank you.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.592
Judd, how are you? How are you?

18:29.692 --> 18:32.637
Geez, look, I'm sorry it took so long
but that last one was a real bitch.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.931
In fact, the whole day has been like that.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.682
Sit down. Come on.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.477
Boy, I could use a drink. You want one?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.646
I'd love one, thanks.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.315
Sorry I've only got one glass.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.713
Johnny Walker rubbing alcohol.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.549
- No, here, you take the pretty one.
- Thank you.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.261
Is something the matter?

18:55.718 --> 18:58.371
Yes. One of my patients
was murdered today.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.248
Jesus. What happened?

19:00.348 --> 19:02.416
Well, I saw him this morning.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.169
And it was raining
so I loaned him my raincoat,

19:05.269 --> 19:08.148
and a few minutes later
he was stabbed to death on the street.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.924
You mean he was mugged?

19:10.024 --> 19:11.551
No, apparently not.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.076
Oh, boy, I tell you.
It gets closer every day.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.682
Who was he?

19:17.782 --> 19:19.934
Just a harmless sort of guy.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.187
Wife, two kids.
I've just broken the news to her.

19:23.287 --> 19:27.316
Anyway, the odd thing is, the two detectives
that came to break the news to me were...

19:27.416 --> 19:29.527
You remember the Zifrin case?

19:29.627 --> 19:31.070
Not really. No.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.446
Well, Zifrin killed a policeman

19:32.546 --> 19:36.909
and I was the principal defense witness
for a successful plea of insanity.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.245
Anyway, one of the two detectives

19:39.345 --> 19:42.565
turned out to be
the ex-partner of the dead policeman.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.150
I know it sounds crazy,
but he treated me like I was a suspect.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.675
Well, screw that. That's ridiculous.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.802
Well, of course it's ridiculous.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.372
But maybe they always
come down that heavy.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.326
Anyway, Pete, I'll tell you something.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.853
It shook me, it really shook me up.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.022
Come on, you don't have to take that.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.750
Throw the book at them.
Who needs that anyway?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.172
Yeah, Hadley.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.447
Okay, I'll come down and take a look.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.740
Listen, I gotta go.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.889
If you get any more hassle,
go see the commissioner.

20:20.052 --> 20:24.081
Listen, I'd invite you home tonight
but Norah and I have to socialize.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.209
I'm collecting a very fat check
for our new pediatric wing.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.212
One of our prominent citizens
is coughing up the last $100,000

20:30.312 --> 20:32.381
and you know me,
I'll go anywhere for a buck.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.799
- Well, thanks for your time.
- Yeah.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.527
You know, I mean,
I can't believe what you just told me...

20:39.321 --> 20:40.789
Evening, Charlie.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.289
I said, good evening.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.277
- Evening, Eddie.
- Good evening, Dr. Stevens.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.196
You want to go up, do you?

20:55.296 --> 20:57.448
That's the usual idea.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.802
Unless of course you prefer me
to sleep in the basement.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.727
What the hell are you doing
in my daughter's bedroom?

21:26.827 --> 21:28.646
Get out, now!

21:28.746 --> 21:29.963
Now!

21:36.045 --> 21:37.422
Take it easy.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.991
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

21:41.091 --> 21:42.451
All right, don't get too excited.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.830
And the answer to your next question,
yes, we do have a search warrant,

21:45.930 --> 21:49.208
and there's one other thing
I gotta tell you that you're...

21:49.308 --> 21:51.711
You're entitled to make
a phone call to your lawyer.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.629
I mean, that's under law
but I have to warn you...

21:53.729 --> 21:56.549
Now let me tell you something, McGreavy,
I've just about had you two.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.619
What is this, some private
grudge you're trying to work off?

21:59.819 --> 22:05.451
No, this is a perfectly legal investigation
into a murder and a break-in.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.080
What break-in?

22:07.451 --> 22:08.998
At your office.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.357
Of course, you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

22:13.457 --> 22:14.483
My office?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.132
Yeah, we'd like to know
where you've been since you left it.

22:17.586 --> 22:21.574
I saw my brother-in-law at his hospital,
and then I had some dinner.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.950
With your brother-in-law?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.827
No, on my own, and I still don't see

22:24.927 --> 22:27.830
how a break-in at my office
entitles you to ransack my apartment!

22:27.930 --> 22:29.415
And you couldn't guess, could you?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.083
No, I couldn't!

22:31.183 --> 22:32.293
And I'll tell you something else.

22:32.393 --> 22:35.212
I am getting pissed off
with your cat and mouse game!

22:35.312 --> 22:39.067
Then I suggest we go down to your office
and see what's changed since you left it!

23:23.110 --> 23:25.238
Here, why don't you sit down?

23:44.340 --> 23:46.684
You sickening bastard.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.229
You left her there for me
to see, didn't you?

23:52.681 --> 23:55.685
I needed positive identification.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.088
You can take her away now.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.440
Yes, sir.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.870
Let me try to explain something to you.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.765
Nobody dies easy in the real world.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.685
Now somebody comes in here, you see,
and they do a job on your girl Friday.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.210
They stick a knife into her,
then they torture her until she's killed!

24:17.373 --> 24:19.546
Now I would like to know why!

24:21.335 --> 24:23.153
Why? What have you got in here?
What are you hiding?

24:23.253 --> 24:25.551
Why would they come in
and do a thing like this?

24:26.423 --> 24:27.783
What is it?
You got something stashed away?

24:27.883 --> 24:29.577
You got dope? You got money?

24:29.677 --> 24:31.537
You do use drugs, don't you?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.747
I don't keep addictive drugs.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.394
Okay, what about the files?

24:35.724 --> 24:36.941
They haven't been touched.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.294
What have you got,
second sight or something?

24:38.394 --> 24:39.674
You haven't even looked at them.

24:39.937 --> 24:42.281
I don't keep written notes.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.926
Most of my case histories are taped.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.403
Then they're...

24:48.487 --> 24:50.910
They're fed into that micro over there.

24:53.367 --> 24:57.605
Unless someone knew
how I coded them, they...

24:57.705 --> 24:59.252
They couldn't break into it.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.216
Well, did the girl know the code?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.339
No.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.530
God, I wish she had.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.758
If that's what they were after.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.606
Don't let it get to you.
He's really a good cop.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.989
Like Hitler was a good painter.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.827
Hello, Mac.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.474
Okay, Sally.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.958
Wanna move that?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.480
Thank you very much.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.037
What are you looking so cheerful about?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.421
What kept you?

26:04.521 --> 26:08.968
I decided to stay
and take a look at the autopsy.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.511
And they found she was dead, right?

26:10.611 --> 26:13.931
Oh, yeah, she's dead.
She's also three months pregnant.

26:14.031 --> 26:18.560
Too late to have a safe abortion
and too little to show.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.646
She's dead,

26:20.746 --> 26:23.315
and I'm an idiot 'cause I had a hunch.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.567
Sally, let me have a skim milk,
would you, please?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.027
Sure thing.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.362
Well, did you talk to the boyfriend?

26:28.462 --> 26:29.738
- Of course.
- What do you mean "of course"?

26:29.838 --> 26:31.073
Well, what did he say?

26:31.173 --> 26:33.892
Clean. He swore he wanted to marry her.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.082
That's an original statement.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.354
They all say that. I wonder,

26:42.476 --> 26:45.045
did he know she was pregnant?

26:45.145 --> 26:46.897
Well, I didn't ask him that.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.091
Well, why not?

26:49.191 --> 26:50.989
I didn't know she was pregnant, did I?

26:51.318 --> 26:53.095
Why didn't you know?
You know why you didn't know?

26:53.195 --> 26:54.847
Because you didn't look.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.890
Okay, so, if he did get her pregnant

26:56.990 --> 26:59.271
and they were getting
married anyway, what's the big deal?

26:59.368 --> 27:01.211
This thing happens every day of the week.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.920
Are we disturbing you or something?

27:05.666 --> 27:07.401
Is there something
we're saying that's intriguing you?

27:07.501 --> 27:08.652
Would you do me a favor, please?

27:08.752 --> 27:12.072
Would you kindly take your stuff
and move about two seats down?

27:12.172 --> 27:15.301
Don't forget your soup.
That's a good girl.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.830
Now, I wanna explain something to you.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.207
A girl comes to a guy
and she says to the guy, “I'm pregnant."

27:22.307 --> 27:24.027
The guy says,
"I don't want any part of it."

27:24.059 --> 27:27.588
And that happens twice a day
every day of the week, every week.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.658
His alibi's tight, Mac.
The guy's straight.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.906
My dear naive friend,
no one in this world is straight, no one.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.475
All right, come on, pay for this,

27:39.575 --> 27:41.727
- and we'll get out of here.
- May I have the check?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.955
- Give him the check, Sally.
- I got it.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.627
Thanks. Take care, guys.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.877
- I'll see you, Sally.
- Okay, take care.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.781
I don't understand why anybody would go
to a shrink that's got a black secretary,

27:53.881 --> 27:55.554
knocks her up and then has to marry her.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.076
Could be a plus.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.536
Maybe he thinks it's extra-cool.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.889
I understand people think that's macho.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.960
She was tortured.
Why would he torture her?

28:07.060 --> 28:10.610
He's a smart doctor.
He must know a million clever ways to kill.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.284
Maybe that's what he wants us to think.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.078
I just don't buy it.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.848
I don't think Stevens
would kill twice in the same day.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.225
- For what?
- What do you mean, for what?

28:21.325 --> 28:22.684
Don't you know
what kind of world it is out there?

28:22.784 --> 28:23.852
They'll kill you for a book of matches,

28:23.952 --> 28:26.438
they'll beat up
an old lady for a bottle of beer.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.658
For a lousy heroin fix, they'll blow you
off the earth and you ask me for what?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.748
What the hell are you,
a boy scout or a fucking cop?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.531
7102, 7102.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.407
Yeah. 7102.

28:37.507 --> 28:41.036
7102, we're on the scene.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.581
We have two homicide victims
on Damon and North Avenue.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.651
All right, Damon and North Avenue,
10-4, we're on the way.

28:47.851 --> 28:48.852
Let's go!

29:17.339 --> 29:18.807
Excuse me.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.785
Stand back, please.
Come on, make some room.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.996
Come on. Stand back, people, stand back.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.348
Excuse me.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.419
- What do we got?
- Pair of deaths.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.838
Good, we're not in danger
of slipping below the national average.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.173
It was Stevens, right?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.591
- Sir?
- Forget it.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.594
Wait a minute. One thing.
Did you get any descriptions here?

29:38.694 --> 29:40.137
No, Lieutenant.

29:40.237 --> 29:43.557
All we got is one guy, medium build,
wearing a stocking.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.977
- Where'd he have it? On his face or his ass?
- On his face.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.626
Good, then we can rule out perversion.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.501
I don't know about you,
I'm getting a little old for this.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.295
I feel sick.

30:13.395 --> 30:14.922
I really feel sick.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.007
Well, anyway,

30:17.107 --> 30:18.800
we got the storybook murder, don't we?

30:18.900 --> 30:22.950
We got two victims, a gun, and a motive.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.145
That's what made America great.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.892
Yeah, well, you take care
of the greatness of America.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.102
I think I'm getting a little too old
to take care of the greatness.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.579
I'm going back to the office.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.487
- You the murderer?
- Me?

30:38.587 --> 30:39.821
- Yeah, you.
- No.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.198
Get your ass out of here.

30:41.298 --> 30:44.076
You don't need any of that, fellows,
all you need is just two stretchers.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.495
Two, two, all right.
Come on, open up, open up, make way.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.395
Don't let anybody touch anything until
the ballistic guys get what they need.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.229
Excuse me.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.775
Mac!

31:00.400 --> 31:03.428
Mac, I don't think
I follow your logic in the Stevens case.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.556
It's too much conjecture.
You got no concrete evidence.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.141
What are you coming
with conjecture? Concrete...

31:08.241 --> 31:11.353
How much concrete do you want?
I'll tell you what we got!

31:11.453 --> 31:13.689
We got one gay guy, who is dead,

31:13.789 --> 31:16.191
who was stabbed a block
away from the office.

31:16.291 --> 31:20.362
We got a little black lady
who was pregnant, who is killed, right?

31:20.462 --> 31:23.657
And we got a doctor
who refuses to let us look into his files

31:23.757 --> 31:25.701
and you're talking to me about conjecture.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.536
Well, then what other motive is there?

31:27.636 --> 31:30.998
Is there the motive of money? No!
Is there the motive of drugs? No!

31:31.098 --> 31:33.977
Well, I think we're
looking for a maniac without a motive!

31:35.519 --> 31:39.649
I think we're looking
for one very smart doctor!

31:42.609 --> 31:44.953
I think you're looking to get even, Mac.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.234
- You know, we've got some spare room...
- I was wondering...

32:01.503 --> 32:03.096
Norah and I...

32:04.089 --> 32:07.117
We're not pushing anything, it's...

32:07.217 --> 32:10.078
It's just that, you know,

32:10.178 --> 32:13.352
we can't help worrying
about you being on your own all the time.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.126
I know how you felt about Liz and Jane.

32:16.226 --> 32:17.919
I mean, Liz was your wife

32:18.019 --> 32:20.238
and she was my sister,
for Christ sakes and...

32:21.022 --> 32:23.366
You know, we all love them.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.363
We love them both, but...

32:29.573 --> 32:33.328
Judd, you gotta bury the dead.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.065
We just think it's...

32:38.165 --> 32:39.462
Honey.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.046
We feel you ought to meet people.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.382
I meet people all the time.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.253
Don't give up on me.
I shall surface one of these days.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.463
I'll see you tomorrow at the hospital.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.631
- Okay.
- Good night.

33:02.731 --> 33:03.778
Good night.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.501
Does this hurt? You have a hematoma there.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.235
As I touch it, does that hurt?

34:05.335 --> 34:06.803
Yes, just a little.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.174
Nurse, let's get him
to X-ray and do a C-spine.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.524
How much longer?

34:28.024 --> 34:30.402
Well, Dr. Garcia would like
to keep you here all night.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.329
No way.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.373
If I'm going to die,
I'm gonna die in my own bed.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.668
Doctors always make the worst patients.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.563
You mean a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.666
Or maybe they're afraid I can't pay.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.628
Excuse me.

34:48.378 --> 34:49.578
Can I help you with something?

34:49.670 --> 34:51.031
Yes, I think she's broken her arm.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.449
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.618
Will you tell me where
Dr. Stevens is, please?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.828
- Who are you?
- We're the police.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.350
He's around the corner.

35:04.519 --> 35:08.673
Well, we heard you had an accident.
You were lucky to escape.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.946
It was not an accident.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.449
Well, the report said
you might have been jaywalking.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.306
Somebody tried to kill me.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.184
I see. So what have you
come up with this time?

35:19.284 --> 35:22.229
A bike that's driving
a couple of wheelchairs,

35:22.329 --> 35:24.249
or a wheelchair that's driving
a couple of bikes?

35:24.873 --> 35:26.900
Lieutenant McGreavy,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.321
whether you believe me or not,
an attempt was made on my life tonight.

35:31.421 --> 35:32.781
Okay, now I'm gonna tell you something.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.617
There's a possibility
that you can convince me,

35:35.717 --> 35:37.577
but you gotta come up
with something a little better

35:37.677 --> 35:40.747
than a cripple driving a Harley-Davidson.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.690
All right, I've been thinking.

35:43.391 --> 35:48.147
I don't believe that the killer
was after Boyd or Carol.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.757
I believe he was after me.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.842
Well, that's wonderful.
Now we don't just have a cripple,

35:52.942 --> 35:54.662
but we've got somebody
who is short-sighted.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.323
Hey, Mac, let's hear the guy out, okay?

35:59.240 --> 36:00.976
Yeah, I'll hear him out,
Angeli, I'll hear him out,

36:01.076 --> 36:04.104
but first I'm going to
ask him a few questions. Do you mind?

36:04.204 --> 36:05.605
Go ahead.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.958
Boyd was wearing my coat.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.128
Obviously the killer mistook him for me.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.948
So the killer thought
he killed the wrong man

36:15.048 --> 36:16.950
and then he went back to your office

36:17.050 --> 36:21.413
and he tore off your clothes
and discovered this voluptuous black lady

36:21.513 --> 36:23.390
and beat you to death.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.906
Well, let me tell you something, Doctor,

36:33.566 --> 36:35.113
the lady was pregnant.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.867
You didn't know that, did you?

36:38.613 --> 36:39.764
No.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.225
I'm surprised. I thought
you medical men were wonderful.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.019
I thought you had professional intuition.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.687
She was entitled
to a private life of her own.

36:45.787 --> 36:48.565
She had a private life, all right!

36:48.665 --> 36:51.860
Did you know that she was a hooker
before she ever went to work for you?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.361
Don't look so surprised.

36:53.461 --> 36:56.156
We ran through a computer on her,
and my dear friend,

36:56.256 --> 36:57.866
- we came up with a jackpot!
- Yes, I knew that!

36:57.966 --> 36:59.951
- I knew it!
- You did?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.769
Then why was she working for you?

37:02.011 --> 37:06.249
Not everybody is born,
as you so delicately put it, a hooker.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.335
I was trying to give her a chance in life.

37:08.435 --> 37:11.780
And maybe get a little something
on the side for yourself?

37:14.482 --> 37:16.426
Get him out of here.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.012
Now wait a minute, wait a minute.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.890
I could be wrong. Oh, yes.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.163
Maybe you were switch-hitting the boy.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.894
Or again, I could be right.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.354
Maybe you were making it
with your secretary.

37:27.454 --> 37:28.897
Maybe you did make her pregnant.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.900
But one thing I wanna tell you, my friend,
I've had enough crap from you!

37:32.000 --> 37:36.363
You're not gonna stand there telling me
that there's a cripple,

37:36.463 --> 37:38.365
who is a hit-and-run driver,

37:38.465 --> 37:43.411
and a maniac driving around this city
killing the wrong people by mistake.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.121
Not me!

37:45.221 --> 37:47.565
And I'm gonna tell you something else!

37:50.018 --> 37:52.020
My friend, please.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.028
You get your strength back

37:57.734 --> 38:02.661
and you get your act together
because you are gonna need it.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.884
The man is sick.

38:18.254 --> 38:22.304
Detective Angeli, you have to help me.

38:24.427 --> 38:27.055
Well, I'll give it my best shot.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.961
Give me a motive for killing you.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.314
You owe money? I mean, real money?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.028
No.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.100
Have you been sleeping around?
We know your wife's dead.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.639
No.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.726
What about your patients?
They're disturbed people.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.728
Maybe one of them has a grudge.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.298
What do you call it, a fixation,
psychosis, have you thought of that?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.041
- Of course.
- And?

38:56.751 --> 38:58.719
Well, naturally, it's a possibility.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.297
Then tell me who they are
and I'll check them out.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.343
That I can't do.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.603
I thought you wanted help.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.330
Try and understand.

39:09.430 --> 39:13.042
I am not a dentist or a chiropodist.

39:13.142 --> 39:17.422
I deal with people with
serious emotional problems.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.508
If you start probing and questioning,

39:20.608 --> 39:22.677
you'll shatter them.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.430
They'd lose all their confidence in me.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.874
I'd never, ever be able to treat them.

39:30.743 --> 39:34.418
Well, then, we'll just have to go along
the way we are, won't we, Doctor?

39:38.418 --> 39:41.905
All I can promise you
is that I'll keep an open mind.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.492
I may not appreciate
my partner's tactics all the time

39:45.592 --> 39:47.390
but I'm out to nail whoever did it.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.287
If you're clean, you got no problem.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.955
But if you're not,

39:51.055 --> 39:53.808
I'll come down on you
just as hard as McGreavy.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.970
Judd, I had all your stuff picked
up and brought over here.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.888
I appreciate it, thanks, Peter.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.241
Beats me why you wanna go back so soon.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.415
It'll be therapy for me listening
to other people's nightmares.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.606
Well, this is it.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.399
Very nice.

40:18.499 --> 40:19.943
Judd, this is Betty.

40:20.043 --> 40:22.779
She's gonna sit in for you until you
find a permanent replacement.

40:22.879 --> 40:24.113
Betty, this is Dr. Stevens.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.448
- Good morning, Betty.
- Good morning, Dr. Stevens.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.867
Now you take good care of him.
He's one of the walking wounded.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.577
Listen, I'll leave you two alone, okay?

40:29.677 --> 40:31.746
- And buzz me if you need anything.
- Okay, thanks.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.582
I wasn't sure
how you wanted to work, Doctor,

40:34.682 --> 40:36.918
but I took the liberty
of calling your patients

40:37.018 --> 40:39.045
and rescheduled their appointments.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.922
You did well, thank you.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.466
There were one or two
I wasn't able to reach yet.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.177
Well, keep trying. Who's the first?

40:46.277 --> 40:50.202
Miss Skoleman is due in 20 minutes.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.750
Thank you.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.525
Detective Angeli, please.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.878
- Who's calling?
- Dr. Stevens.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.030
Detective Angeli.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.449
Hello, Angeli, look, I'm sorry
to worry you, but I had a thought.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.076
- What is it?
- Zifrin.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.661
What about him?

41:11.761 --> 41:13.746
Well, could you check
whether he's still inside?

41:13.846 --> 41:15.164
He's doing life.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.917
Well, he could have escaped
or been let out on parole.

41:18.017 --> 41:20.211
No way, but I'll check it out.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.462
Thanks, I'd appreciate it.

41:21.562 --> 41:22.939
I'll let you know.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.536
- I'll wait to hear from you.
- Yeah, okay.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.200
I need sex.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.615
Like right now, I...

41:34.784 --> 41:36.081
I could ball you.

41:37.787 --> 41:41.733
I've told you
that if you go on talking like that,

41:41.833 --> 41:43.255
I can't treat you.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.925
So stop treating me.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.551
Sometimes it's like
a scream inside my head.

41:52.010 --> 41:56.164
Like the only thing
that can stop it, is a knife, and I...

41:56.264 --> 41:58.374
- A knife?
- What?

41:58.474 --> 42:01.294
A knife. Why did you think of it?

42:01.394 --> 42:04.505
Because all the men I've had,

42:04.605 --> 42:07.508
all the men I'm gonna have,

42:07.608 --> 42:09.451
going inside me,

42:13.281 --> 42:15.375
cutting me open.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.313
I lied to you, Doctor.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.586
I've been lying to you the entire time.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.132
Well, it's really not important.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.760
It's important to me.

42:30.465 --> 42:35.062
You see, there was really no reason
for me to consult you, ever.

42:36.137 --> 42:38.310
There's nothing worrying me.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.042
Everything in my life is perfect.

42:41.142 --> 42:45.067
I had to explain, otherwise you might have
jumped to the wrong conclusions.

42:45.438 --> 42:47.840
Then when I read
in the papers about your poor secretary,

42:47.940 --> 42:50.989
I felt so badly about that.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.223
Why would anyone do such a horrible thing?

42:55.323 --> 42:59.123
Well, that's a question
a lot of people would like answered.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.917
It's almost as if...

43:08.669 --> 43:15.326
You see, the reason I came to see you,
the reason I took up your time, it...

43:15.426 --> 43:17.662
It wasn't for me.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.265
I wasn't asking for help.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.918
Thank you.

43:24.018 --> 43:27.922
I wasn't asking for help for myself.

43:28.022 --> 43:32.093
It was for a friend of mine

43:32.193 --> 43:35.555
who didn't have the courage
to face up to something.

43:35.655 --> 43:38.204
Well, I thought maybe I could...

43:41.035 --> 43:44.209
Of course I realize now
that was really very foolish of me.

43:45.665 --> 43:48.043
She's over it now, is she,
this friend of yours?

43:49.168 --> 43:51.696
- Whatever it was.
- What was that?

43:51.796 --> 43:53.924
She's over it, your... Your friend?

43:57.927 --> 44:00.146
Well, she's moved away,

44:00.388 --> 44:02.811
so, yes, I guess she must be.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.528
It's difficult to know
anyone completely, isn't it?

44:15.361 --> 44:17.805
I suppose it is.

44:17.905 --> 44:22.160
I seem to have spent most of my life trying
to get people to know themselves.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.422
Yes, that's what my friend said.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.611
Thank you.

44:31.711 --> 44:32.904
You see...

44:33.004 --> 44:36.949
Well, I can tell you now
because it's really academic

44:37.049 --> 44:41.429
but my friend stumbled upon
something just by accident.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.312
Something evil,

44:46.767 --> 44:49.065
and it changed her entire life.

44:49.979 --> 44:54.860
I think that she
began to doubt her own sanity.

44:55.443 --> 44:57.512
Is that very unusual, would you say?

44:57.612 --> 45:02.539
No, we all have secret doubts,
and secret fears.

45:03.451 --> 45:07.297
Imagination can
lead us up all sorts of blind alleys.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.983
But as you said,

45:11.083 --> 45:14.487
in the case of your friend,
it is happily academic.

45:14.587 --> 45:18.866
Still, if she ever needs advice,

45:18.966 --> 45:21.786
I'm always available.

45:21.886 --> 45:24.639
Well, I've taken up enough of your time.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.334
Not at all.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.711
I've enjoyed meeting you, Mrs. Blake.
Here, let me.

45:30.811 --> 45:33.005
No, that's all right. Thank you.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.466
And you don't owe me anything.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.786
I shall count you
as one of my rare successes.

45:44.325 --> 45:45.998
Yes, I hope so.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.344
Evening, Charlie.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.323
Don't worry about the car,
I'm going out later.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.603
What's happened to Charlie?

46:28.703 --> 46:30.250
He's on vacation, Doctor.

46:49.181 --> 46:51.250
What do you mean, you charged it?

46:51.350 --> 46:53.586
Look, you need
a new fur coat like I need herpes.

46:53.686 --> 46:55.029
Well, tough.

47:00.234 --> 47:01.781
Ninth floor, isn't it, Doctor?

47:02.069 --> 47:04.180
I left something in my car.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.766
I'll get it. Get in.

47:06.866 --> 47:09.310
You heard the man, Doctor. Get in.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.896
There's no way I'm gonna pay
for another fucking coat.

47:11.996 --> 47:13.476
What's wrong with the one you've got?

47:15.291 --> 47:17.652
They never killed it,
that's what's wrong with it.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.487
Fifteen. Listen, I'm telling you,

47:19.587 --> 47:22.323
I'm gonna cancel every
goddamn credit card you've got.

47:22.423 --> 47:24.517
All right, come on, let's go.

47:28.763 --> 47:29.935
Shit!

49:51.572 --> 49:52.807
- What are you shooting at?
- Nothing.

49:52.907 --> 49:54.707
- Now what the hell's the matter?
- It's cool.

49:59.580 --> 50:00.877
Hold it!

50:02.917 --> 50:04.193
Is someone sick?

50:04.293 --> 50:06.695
Come on, man. There've got to be
50 apartments in this lousy building.

50:06.795 --> 50:07.988
I'm still gonna check the elevator.

50:08.088 --> 50:10.386
Do it, man. Hurry! Hurry! Come on.

50:33.739 --> 50:34.932
- Hide the gun!
- What?

50:35.032 --> 50:36.851
I think maybe they're coming in here.

50:36.951 --> 50:38.471
- Who's coming in here?
- Just hide it.

50:38.619 --> 50:40.246
No, no, wrong way. Follow me.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.768
It's all clear. Let's get out of here.

50:45.125 --> 50:48.195
Are you the guys that called us?

50:48.295 --> 50:50.448
- Yeah.
- Are we in time?

50:50.548 --> 50:52.032
- Yeah.
- Where is he?

50:52.132 --> 50:54.285
- He's in there.
- You call the police yet?

50:54.385 --> 50:56.979
- No.
- All right, do me a favor, will you?

50:57.096 --> 50:58.372
Go down and call the police right away.

50:58.472 --> 50:59.915
It's very important.
I'll take care of it up here.

51:00.015 --> 51:02.168
Give me that, come on. Let's go.

51:02.268 --> 51:04.020
Bring this through. Come on.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.034
Judd.

51:11.652 --> 51:13.471
Judd, open up.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.556
It's okay, it's me, Peter.

51:15.656 --> 51:17.224
Pete?

51:17.324 --> 51:20.328
Check outside, will you?
Make sure everything's clear.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.566
God almighty, you had me scared.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.043
You okay?

51:28.711 --> 51:30.179
Yeah, I'm fine.

51:31.630 --> 51:33.632
God, I'm glad to see you.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.578
I heard a shot.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.851
I thought the next was for me.

51:42.349 --> 51:43.751
I need a drink.

51:43.851 --> 51:47.025
Okay, suicide, come on,
I'll force brandy down your throat.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.508
- Talk to me.
- Armed robbery. Two guys.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.888
- You get anybody?
- No, not yet.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.677
- Anybody hurt?
- Got somebody upstairs

51:53.777 --> 51:55.179
checking on the ninth floor.

51:55.279 --> 51:58.533
And surprise, surprise,
guess who they were after.

51:59.533 --> 52:00.809
- Who?
- Dr. Stevens.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.437
Maybe there is something
to his story after all.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.585
I'll believe that if he's dead.

52:09.209 --> 52:12.613
Well, the only damn thing I could
think of was to make that suicide call,

52:12.713 --> 52:14.365
but I never expected you to show up.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.700
I just happened to be
in emergency when the call came in

52:16.800 --> 52:18.160
and I recognized the address.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.980
Hey, I didn't do
too badly either, you know.

52:20.012 --> 52:22.856
I told those phony doormen
to call the police.

52:23.182 --> 52:24.625
Doctor, there's some activity downstairs.

52:24.725 --> 52:26.773
- The cops have just arrived.
- Yeah, fine.

52:27.728 --> 52:30.089
That doesn't make sense.
They did what you told them.

52:30.189 --> 52:32.883
No, no. I radioed ahead
from the ambulance.

52:32.983 --> 52:34.718
Okay, you two can cut now. Thanks a lot.

52:34.818 --> 52:35.970
- Sure.
- Yes, thank you.

52:36.070 --> 52:37.572
- You're welcome.
- Cheers.

52:39.406 --> 52:40.874
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

52:41.742 --> 52:43.978
We found the two real doormen
in the storage room.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.813
- Dead or alive?
- Alive.

52:45.913 --> 52:48.587
- Well, that's one point for our side.
- Yes, sir.

52:49.583 --> 52:52.027
A refill.
I'm not gonna get drunk on my own.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.424
Hey, hey. That's it.

52:59.593 --> 53:01.787
Lieutenant McGreavy.

53:01.887 --> 53:06.500
A little early for the wake but in time
for a drink, that is if you drink on duty.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.352
No, I...

53:09.269 --> 53:11.067
I never drink with suspects.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.341
See what I mean?

53:14.441 --> 53:17.741
Well, this time, Lieutenant,
I have witnesses.

53:19.613 --> 53:20.990
Witnesses to what?

53:21.782 --> 53:24.410
A break-in and an attempt on my life.

53:25.994 --> 53:28.522
What was it this time?

53:28.622 --> 53:31.025
A midget with a laser beam?

53:31.125 --> 53:34.720
There were two men here
when my team arrived.

53:36.714 --> 53:38.057
I see.

53:39.550 --> 53:40.743
Two men.

53:40.843 --> 53:42.845
Yes, dressed as doormen.

53:45.848 --> 53:48.601
Dressed as doormen. And who are you?

53:50.602 --> 53:53.776
My name's Dr. Hadley.
And I'm Dr. Stevens' brother-in-law.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.842
I see.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.410
It's a family affair.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.555
Well, since you're
a professional man, Doctor,

54:01.655 --> 54:05.768
I'm sure you can give us a full description,
you can give us the Medicare details,

54:05.868 --> 54:08.729
and you can give us
the serial number on the guns.

54:08.829 --> 54:10.422
There were guns, weren't there?

54:10.706 --> 54:12.107
Presumably, yes.

54:12.207 --> 54:14.585
Presumably doesn't make conviction.

54:17.504 --> 54:19.239
Got a victim, Lieutenant.

54:19.339 --> 54:21.012
And a bullet hole in the wall.

54:22.134 --> 54:24.036
Well, now, we've got
an open and shut case.

54:24.136 --> 54:28.290
We've got a blown away teddy bear
shot by person or persons unknown,

54:28.390 --> 54:31.251
a lot more mystery, and me,

54:31.351 --> 54:32.944
I'm not getting anywhere.

54:33.562 --> 54:35.130
Now I tell you what we're gonna do.

54:35.230 --> 54:36.423
We're gonna go down to the station,

54:36.523 --> 54:38.425
and we're gonna look
at some mug shots, you see,

54:38.525 --> 54:40.094
and my men are gonna tear this place apart

54:40.194 --> 54:41.970
and they better come up
with something positive.

54:42.070 --> 54:44.181
Because if they don't,
I wanna tell you in medical terms,

54:44.281 --> 54:47.706
both of you are becoming
a pain in the ass.

54:48.452 --> 54:49.795
Shall we go?

54:51.371 --> 54:53.148
Lieutenant.

54:53.248 --> 54:58.320
The only thing your department has on me
is three unpaid parking tickets.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.700
And to the best of my knowledge,

54:59.755 --> 55:02.116
Dr. Stevens has not been
charged with any crime,

55:02.216 --> 55:05.561
so I'll give you
a little free medical advice in return.

55:06.011 --> 55:08.122
You know, you don't look
in good shape to me.

55:08.222 --> 55:11.125
You're overweight, you've got liver spots,

55:11.225 --> 55:14.253
and your neck gets red when you get angry.

55:14.353 --> 55:16.004
So I'd quit threatening if I were you.

55:16.104 --> 55:19.007
You want us to accompany you
to the police station, all right.

55:19.107 --> 55:21.427
Ask politely.

55:21.527 --> 55:24.952
Or I'll bounce a complaint
on the commissioner's desk so fast,

55:25.531 --> 55:27.249
you won't believe it.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.978
And for your further information,

55:31.078 --> 55:34.148
I delivered
the commissioner's wife's last baby

55:34.248 --> 55:35.716
and he was very grateful.

55:37.417 --> 55:38.464
Boy or girl?

55:40.254 --> 55:41.655
Boy.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.257
Congratulations.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.552
Let's get out of here.

56:04.194 --> 56:07.198
Sally, a cup of coffee? And a plain donut.

56:10.617 --> 56:13.270
- Get anything?
- Nope. Nothing. Nobody's talking.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.855
How about you? Did they pick anybody out?

56:14.955 --> 56:19.193
Oh, yeah, we got a winner. He's only
been jailed for the last 822,000 years.

56:19.293 --> 56:22.488
I did come up with
one interesting little item though.

56:22.588 --> 56:23.781
What was that?

56:23.881 --> 56:26.805
Stevens' wife
was apparently quite well-heeled.

56:26.967 --> 56:28.535
I looked up the newspaper accounts

56:28.635 --> 56:31.246
of the car crash that killed
her and the daughter.

56:31.346 --> 56:34.958
And tucked away in the file were details
of her published will.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.710
Stevens didn't get anything.

56:36.810 --> 56:40.547
In the event of
her dying without issue, the entire...

56:40.647 --> 56:43.425
- What do you mean, issue?
- Childless.

56:43.525 --> 56:46.053
The entire estate passed
to her brother's children.

56:46.153 --> 56:47.951
What do we know about Hadley?

56:49.364 --> 56:50.557
I don't know.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.559
Why don't you ask the commissioner's wife?

56:52.659 --> 56:55.687
Seriously. Should I do some digging?
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

56:55.787 --> 56:58.482
I don't think
we should leave a doctor unturned.

56:58.582 --> 57:01.381
Mac, will you take some advice from me?

57:02.419 --> 57:04.404
Go easy on Stevens.

57:04.504 --> 57:07.974
Too many people know
how you feel about the Zifrin trial.

57:08.759 --> 57:12.287
Even assuming you're able
to put a circumstantial case together,

57:12.387 --> 57:15.015
any half-assed lawyer
would just throw you out of court.

57:16.350 --> 57:17.772
Is that it?

57:19.394 --> 57:22.614
Is that the advice?

57:24.274 --> 57:25.696
Not entirely.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.931
I had a word with the captain about you.

57:31.031 --> 57:32.999
What were you doing, protecting your job?

57:33.450 --> 57:35.602
No, because I care about you.

57:35.702 --> 57:37.855
If you care about me,
well, I'll tell you what you can do.

57:37.955 --> 57:40.482
You can forget about caring about me,
you see, because I can take care of myself.

57:40.582 --> 57:42.943
I can take care of Stevens
and you know what you can do?

57:43.043 --> 57:45.341
You can take care of the fucking check!

57:48.048 --> 57:49.675
Excuse me, gentlemen.

58:35.429 --> 58:37.932
I was traveling in a train,

58:40.142 --> 58:44.713
sitting across from a young man
who was reading one of those

58:44.813 --> 58:46.611
men's magazines...

58:48.358 --> 58:50.201
You know the kind I mean.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.328
He tried to engage me in conversation,

58:57.325 --> 59:00.062
but I sensed he was being over-familiar.

59:00.162 --> 59:02.381
Is this still part of the dream?

59:02.789 --> 59:04.416
No. No.

59:05.876 --> 59:08.925
The dream came later.

59:10.088 --> 59:11.865
This was real.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.534
Betty, I don't like to be disturbed
when I'm with a patient.

59:14.634 --> 59:17.955
Sorry, Doctor. I have a call from
Ann Blake. She says it's urgent.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.272
I'll be right out.

59:21.433 --> 59:23.527
Miss Graham, excuse me a moment.

59:26.772 --> 59:28.570
- Line two, Doctor.
- Okay.

59:29.858 --> 59:32.719
Hello. Mrs. Blake, Dr. Stevens.

59:32.819 --> 59:37.199
Doctor, I know I shouldn't disturb
you but this is important.

59:38.825 --> 59:40.873
I've seen that friend of mine again,

59:42.412 --> 59:47.259
and she wants me
to tell you that she wasn't wrong.

59:48.335 --> 59:51.680
That there is something evil.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.473
Terribly evil.

59:54.841 --> 59:57.077
Which puts you in danger.

59:57.177 --> 59:59.680
Well, what sort of danger?

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:04.418
Mrs. Blake, why don't you come over
here and we can talk about it?

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:07.254
No, I'm afraid that I... I can't.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.922
I'm afraid that's impossible.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.924
I'll try and ring you again.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:12.884
Wait a minute, Mrs. Blake.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.031
Mrs. Blake!

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.696
Mrs. Blake.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:31.678
I wanna thank you for caring for me because
they just took me off the Stevens case.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.302
Angeli! Come in here, will you?

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.059
Mac,

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.933
I really am sorry.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.857
Fuck you.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.793
You Mr. Morgens?

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.670
Are you Mr. Morgens?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.591
Are you the Dr. Stevens
that made the appointment?

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:55.795
I am.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.506
Who recommended me?

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:02.577
Well, nobody, exactly.
I got your name out of the yellow pages.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:04.145
So I recommended me.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.938
Like I say, never knock
the power of advertising.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:10.735
Come on in.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.988
You medical or philosophical?

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.418
I'm a psychoanalyst.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.186
There's a couch over there.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:31.165
You can lie down
if you'll feel more at home.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.192
Tell me all your problems.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.319
You drink coffee?

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:40.115
No, thanks. I'm sorry,
I'd be wasting your time. I made a mistake.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.867
It's gonna cost you though.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:44.436
Like in your racket,
you got to pay for cancellations.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.556
Okay. How much?

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.730
Minimum charge. $50.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:55.064
- $50?
- More... More if you like.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.356
I'm not proud.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:05.223
On the other hand,
now that you've parted with the bread,

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.976
why don't you at least get an opinion?
You're entitled.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.196
Got to say, I can't promise
whether I'm gonna tell you

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.148
you've got hemorrhoids
but maybe I can diagnose something

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.525
a little more personal.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.377
Why don't you sit down?

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:23.846
Right in that chair.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:26.328
There's not a cat on that chair, is there?

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:28.146
Same color. Now...

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.730
Now then. What is it?

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:34.982
Money or women?

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.589
Like I always say, take away them two,

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:40.738
and you got most of the problems
of the world solved right off.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:48.433
Don't be put off by the decor,
I know it's not House & Garden

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.310
but I mostly deal with
people that are down.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.412
I like to make them feel easy.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:56.754
I haven't got the fanciest place
in the world here,

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:01.259
I don't have a pretty little secretary
with a cute little butt prancing around

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.659
but I've been around a few years.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:06.851
I know a trick or two.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:14.192
And I sure as hell
can give you the right time.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:16.903
I think...

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.117
I think somebody's trying to murder me.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.746
What reason could anybody have
to do a thing like that, Doc?

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.330
I have no idea. As far as I know,
I have no enemies to speak of.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.375
- Are you married?
- No.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.149
I have to ask this.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:39.341
Are you a fairy?

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.254
My wife is dead.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.032
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.134
Do you owe anybody any money?

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:50.803
Look, Mr. Morgens,

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.981
I have been through
all of this with the police.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.395
Well, I imagine so.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.188
Only difference is you're paying me.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.528
What about your patients, Doc?

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.281
Most of your patients
are loonies, right, Doc?

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.862
If you're talking clinically, no.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.037
Seems to me most people are crazy today.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.376
Take your coffee straight?

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.249
I don't want any, thanks.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:18.006
Well, you can't catch it off
a cracked cup, you know.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:23.236
Now the way I see it,
is the first thing we have to do

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:26.340
is to find out whether somebody's
actually trying to knock you off

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:28.491
or whether you're nuts yourself.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:32.687
Now, which of the boys
in blue have you been dealing with?

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.729
A Lieutenant McGreavy
and a Detective Angeli.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:42.756
Now, to come clean with you, I must tell
you that I read the papers, too.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.359
So you're not exactly unfamiliar to me.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:52.182
Now one of the first things we have to do
is find out if there's a game in progress.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:55.185
Then we'll find out who the players are.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.885
And you're gonna take a little vacation.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:59.314
- A vacation?
- Yeah, immediately.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:00.732
Tomorrow morning.

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:03.193
No, no, no. That's impossible. I...

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.944
I've got regular patients scheduled.

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:07.614
Well, cancel them. Cancel them.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:10.909
First thing you do
when you leave here is go straight home.

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:13.953
Book yourself in a nice,
quiet place in the country.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.830
Call the cops,

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.958
tell them that you've been
called out of town on an emergency case,

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.127
you'll be gone for a week or so.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.776
I don't want them
hunting for you while you're gone.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:25.590
By the way,

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.069
I think you're gonna have to give me
a couple of big ones for a retainer.

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.994
Minus the $50 you already gave me.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:39.813
These damn clocks
are expensive to run, you know.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:43.042
I got to get a special kind of oil
for them and everything.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.254
- $150.
- Thank you.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.482
Tell me what's going on.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.026
I feel like I've been reading
too much Raymond Chandler.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.612
We're rolling for high stakes, Mac.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.698
The man has a lot of friends in town.

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:34.659
That's why I had to take you off the case.
You played it too rough.

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:36.369
Yeah, but I want him
to think I have a grudge.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:37.745
It's the only way
we're gonna save our necks,

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:40.689
it's the only way we can win.
We got to play it that way.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.819
I've been thinking.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:56.222
If you were to resign from the force,
it would be in character.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.074
Is that what you're asking?

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.159
Might help.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.396
He might think the pressure was off.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.373
Might make him get careless.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:10.086
Let's talk it over.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.381
Don't turn it. Just step out of the car.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.162
Damn it, Mr. Morgens.

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:03.560
Don't ever do that again.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.895
Forgive me, Doc.
I enjoy a little theatrics now and then.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.298
You know what intrigued me
about your problem, Doc?

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:13.800
Seems like every five minutes,

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:16.528
somebody's trying
to pull the curtains on you.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.680
Come here, I wanna show you something.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.124
You wanna release the hood for me, please?

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.702
Open it up gently.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.318
Good thing I'm a bad sleeper.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:35.671
I got here around midnight.
That was done before that.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.225
Rigged up two ways, too,
just to make sure.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.662
That little mother
would have cut short your vacation.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:46.232
Not that you was ever gonna take one.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.752
That was just appetizer.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.629
You know, I always say,
you wanna catch a shark,

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:54.027
you got to bloody up the water first.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:59.116
Well, it ain't all that bad.
Made some progress.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.574
Found out two things.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:04.450
What are those?

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:09.289
Well, first we know that
you're not a basket case.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:15.720
And second, we know that somebody is
God almighty anxious to shut your mouth.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:21.492
Now, let's put this little baby
safe in my car

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.640
and then we'll go out
and grab some breakfast.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:27.373
I don't know about you,
but sleepless nights

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.942
always give me one hell of an appetite.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:35.907
Easy does it.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:41.054
Now then, are we dealing
with some homicidal maniac

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.498
or have we got something
deeper going on here?

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.059
I guess something deeper, Mr. Morgens.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.435
Two men came to my apartment.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:50.980
I could go along with the theory
of one homicidal maniac

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.150
but two working together,
that I can't buy.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.877
Okay, you're the doctor. Why?

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:02.700
Well, because although
a deranged mind has an obsession,

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.287
it almost invariably
works to a definite pattern.

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.185
Now, if it was one man,

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.918
and there were going to be other murders
after Boyd and my secretary,

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:14.754
then the first time he failed to kill me,

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.090
he would have moved
to the next one on the list.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.092
But that didn't happen.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:22.241
Somebody's been concentrating on me.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.372
And there were two men.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.225
Got you.

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:30.478
Now then, tell old Norman Z this.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.751
Did you have any secret

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:38.986
that was common to Boyd
and your secretary?

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:42.761
You know, something
that only you three knew about?

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:48.601
No. I never discussed patient with
patient or patient with secretary.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.749
What about families?

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.085
What do you mean, families?

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:57.485
Well, when you take on a patient,
do you interview the family?

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.216
Very rarely.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.010
In most cases,
the relatives aren't even aware

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.578
that I've been consulted.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.848
That could be it.

01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:10.810
All right, it's your beehive,
you're the keeper of the honey.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.563
Now I'll tell you what I want you to do.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.837
Go right back to your office,
run down your computer records.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:19.819
Only do me a favor.
Don't read them like a doctor.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.738
Read them like a detective.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:25.825
And look for something
at least little bit offbeat.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.161
- Okay.
- One more thing.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:31.185
Bury your lifestyle. Break all the molds.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:33.857
You have a gun?

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:37.148
No, I don't believe in them.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:39.844
I don't believe in Santa Claus.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.109
He still comes around every Christmas.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.187
That was rather a short vacation, Doctor.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.379
Yes.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.710
Well, they tried again last night.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.861
They planted a bomb in my car.

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.696
That ought to convince McGreavy.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.824
McGreavy's been taken off this case.
I'm running it now.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:09.143
Is that the car you're talking about?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.663
No, I exchanged it.
Morgens thought it would be a good idea.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.982
Morgens? Who the hell is Morgens?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.376
A man I hired.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:18.711
What sort of a man?

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:21.047
A private investigator.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.174
There's one born every minute.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.009
What do you think we're here for?

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:28.888
Okay, it's your money.
Get back to the bomb. Where is it?

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.933
Morgens has it. He dismantled it,
and before you say anything else,

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:34.227
if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.645
Yeah?

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:38.498
How did you get on to this Sherlock?

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.734
I...

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.111
I found him in the yellow pages.

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:46.864
You know, for a smart shrink,
you're not too bright.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.992
You find plumbers in the yellow pages,
not life insurance.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.536
What do you know about him?

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.183
I know I trust him.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:58.417
Doctor, the only person in the world
you should trust right now is me.

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:03.381
Look, the fact that I picked Morgens
at random must weigh in his favor.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:07.718
I mean, he couldn't possibly be
connected with this at all, could he?

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:10.221
Do you mind if we continue this inside?

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.744
I feel a little conspicuous out here.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.728
Morgens also thought
it would be a good idea

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:20.206
if I made myself scarce for a while.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.109
He said it would smoke them out.

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:26.237
- And then he found the bomb for you?
- Yes.

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:28.089
- And that's why you trust him?
- Yes.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.176
Didn't that ever cross your mind?

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.288
- Good morning, Betty.
- Dr. Stevens,

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.498
I didn't expect to see you today.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:40.376
- Any messages?
- No, just some disappointed patients.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.568
No calls.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:45.506
What I'm trying to say is,
didn't it ever occur to you

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:48.951
that this Morgens character
might have planted the bomb himself?

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.721
- Why would he?
- Why? Just to win your confidence.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.557
I mean, you've got to be
an expert to handle high explosives.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:57.143
We're not talking
Fourth of July firecrackers.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:58.936
I think it's very unlikely.

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:03.190
Everything about this
goddamn case is unlikely.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.485
But I'll tell you one thing.
Whoever is behind it can afford to pay

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:09.322
your private detective
a hell of a lot more than you can.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:13.409
Okay, you do nothing
without contacting me, okay?

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:16.203
I'm not Lieutenant McGreavy, remember?

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:19.147
I happen to be on your side
despite everything.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.375
I'm gonna leave you my home number.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.148
You do understand I had to do something.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.421
Yeah, what's done is done.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.465
But don't keep me in the dark.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:30.301
I can't help you
if you go off on your own.

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:31.510
And whatever you do,

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:35.786
please don't meet Morgens alone again
without me, okay?

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.267
All right, if you say so.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:41.854
Okay. You're a taxpayer, right?

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.376
Get your money's worth.

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:10.091
Hello. Yes.

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:11.592
Morgens? Where are you?

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:15.721
Never mind that.
I told you I had a hunch. And I was right.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.414
I know who killed Boyd and the girl.

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.060
Now, if you wanna know
why you're next, Doctor,

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.834
we've got to meet and talk. So come alone.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.591
Couldn't we meet here at the hospital?
That safe enough?

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:31.570
No, I was followed.
But I think I've managed to shake them.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:34.907
Meet me at the end
of Navy Pier as soon as you can.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.075
Come alone.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.285
Are you sure you really know?

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:39.954
I'm dead sure.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:43.308
Have you ever heard of Don Vinton?
Just get there.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.068
Don Vinton?

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.349
- Yeah, hello?
- Angeli.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.059
- Who's that?
- It's me, Stevens.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:05.021
- You got some news?
- Yes, Morgens just contacted me.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.648
- He says he has the answer.
- Does he?

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.900
Wants me to meet him
at the end of Navy Pier.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.653
- Where you calling from?
- I'm still at the hospital.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.130
I'll pick you up right away.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.163
You take that.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.749
Well, this is the end of Navy Pier.
Where the hell is he?

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.819
Morgens! Mr. Morgens!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.196
Come here.

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:39.681
Morgens!

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:19.780
Dr. Stevens,
this is a murder investigation,

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.475
not some stupid game
you can play according to your own rules.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:26.579
Three people have died horribly, Doctor.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.773
You tell me that you have evidence.

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:31.375
Well, let me tell you something.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:35.004
I've applied for a court order to force you
to give us that information.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.778
I am not prepared to pussyfoot
around any longer.

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:40.809
- What about the name Morgens gave me?
- What about it?

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:43.499
Well, he said he knew. He said the
man we were after is Don Vinton.

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:44.826
Why aren't you looking for him?

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.037
Read him the list.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.853
We checked every Vinton
in the Chicago area.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.980
There are 11.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.860
We narrowed those down
to four possibles... No, five.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.987
One's bedridden and blind.

01:20:00.087 --> 01:20:01.322
Then there's a priest,

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:05.951
there's a bank president who's been
on vacation in Switzerland for a month,

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:10.289
and a fireman who was on duty
during two of the murders,

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:13.313
and an 82-year-old person
who runs a pet shop.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.420
And we've also put a tap out to the FBI.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.130
They also drew a blank.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.967
Maybe you heard it wrong
or maybe he was kidding. Who knows?

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:24.345
I did not mishear him.

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:25.721
And I still believe him.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.994
For God's sakes, Morgens is dead!

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.456
Well, I owe him that at least.

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:34.730
Now, I have business to attend to.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.673
And I suggest you attend to yours.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.752
I'll be in prison if you want me.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.471
I do a clinic there every week.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.246
Keep tabs on him around the clock.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:51.848
I intend to.

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:56.777
By the way, is it true
that McGreavy resigned?

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.322
He turned in his resignation.
I'm sitting on it.

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:05.865
Fallon comes up for parole
on the 13th of next month.

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:08.865
His lawyer seems to think
he has a pretty good chance.

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.288
He seems rational enough these days.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.084
Hasn't given us any trouble lately.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.069
Can I ask you a question?

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.467
- About Fallon?
- No. Not about Fallon.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:27.783
Have you ever heard of
anybody called Don Vinton?

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.305
Sure.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:39.979
You know somebody of that name?

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.147
Sure.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.050
Do you know where I can find him?

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.824
You were probably looking at him.
He's here.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.147
There, yeah, there he is.

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:00.733
See that guy standing
over there by the wall?

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.335
That's our Don Vinton.

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:04.320
He's doing life.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.299
Five counts of first-degree murder.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.700
Know his specialty?

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.144
He used to nail guys to the floor

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:16.269
by their scrotums,
pour paraffin all around it,

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:18.646
and light it.

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.937
He boasted that he always
gave them a choice.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:26.359
But you said,
"our Don Vinton." What does that mean?

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.427
Well, you see, it's a nickname.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.304
Every jail has one.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:32.598
It's Italian for "big man."

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:35.872
Like here. I'm the Don Vinton.

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:39.338
Hey, Angeli! Phone! Line two.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.069
Give him a call and let me know.
All right.

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:46.842
I'll take it over there.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.305
Angeli.

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:56.888
Say that again.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:23:00.084
I said I know who Don Vinton is.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:01.960
Except it's nobody.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:05.422
It's just an expression,
an Italian nickname.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:07.445
Well, that's why you all drew a blank.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:09.968
It means the top man.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.470
Are you saying it's the family?

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.306
Well, it has to be.
It fits in with what Morgens said.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.350
He was convinced
the killings were being done

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.623
by more than one man, by an organization.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:22.815
Because if you're only half right,
you are in big trouble. Where are you?

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:26.568
I'm in a bar, it's called Georgia's,

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:29.672
and it's on the corner
of Franklin and Kinsey.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:30.922
Stay there.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:33.092
Have a lot of people around you.
I'm on my way.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.396
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.284
It was smart of you
to figure that out, Doctor.

01:26:00.197 --> 01:26:02.074
Well, I just got lucky.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.751
Yeah.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:09.919
Where are we going?

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:12.568
I'm putting you
in a safe house under protection

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:14.796
until we get this thing sorted out.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:36.873
So this is what a safe house looks like.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:44.975
You know, for a smart shrink,
you don't pull down too much psychology.

01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:47.043
You trusted the wrong cop.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.550
At last I have the pleasure
of meeting the famous Dr. Stevens.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:22.012
Forgive me for having you brought
to me in this unconventional fashion.

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.723
But it was necessary for me to

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.667
ask you a few personal questions.
Sit down.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:40.906
My name is Cortini, as I'm sure you know.

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.053
No, why should I?

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:45.018
You've been seeing my wife as a patient.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.930
I have no patient by that name.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:51.730
Maybe you know her
by her maiden name, Blake.

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:53.935
Ann Blake.

01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:57.255
Ann Blake is your wife?

01:27:57.355 --> 01:28:00.467
Yes. Shall we not play games here, Doctor?

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:02.786
You're not here to act the innocent.

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.889
And I know my wife
has been consulting you,

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:08.538
now what I don't know,
what I need to find out is why.

01:28:09.326 --> 01:28:10.452
Why, Doctor?

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:14.923
Your wife came to me
for the usual professional reasons.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.380
What are they?

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:21.446
In my work, I come into contact

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:24.140
with people with a variety
of emotional problems.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.618
What? Emotional problems?

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:29.454
Yes, in basic terms.

01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:32.290
And what exactly, notice I said exactly,

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.939
were my wife's emotional problems, Doctor?

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:38.238
Non-existent, as far as I could tell.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:44.803
I can't betray any professional confidence,
but I can assure you that in my opinion,

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:46.555
she has no serious condition.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:49.349
You can assure me of that, can you?

01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:50.849
We're not making any progress here.

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:58.716
Let me explain.

01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.934
If you don't betray

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:10.975
what you call a professional confidence,

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:16.443
I'm gonna have things
done to you, you wouldn't believe.

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:22.616
Now I know she paid you three visits.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:26.365
Three separate visits.

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:32.434
That seems excessive if she had no

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:35.128
emotional problems
worth speaking of, wouldn't you say?

01:29:36.162 --> 01:29:39.462
Some patients merely want
the comfort of talking.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:41.301
All right.

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:47.765
What did she talk about?

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:49.885
Did she talk about me?

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.789
Only obliquely.
All she ever said about you was that

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:56.608
you were in the construction business.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.546
Are you sure
she didn't say the demolition business?

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:04.069
You're not trying, Doctor.
You notice he's not trying?

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:08.758
Maybe you're trying too hard,
maybe you're trying to be smart.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.617
Which is it?

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:15.331
Your wife said nothing that
would in any way embarrass you.

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:20.628
Unfortunately, that's not
something I can take on trust.

01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:25.387
You're a dead man, Doctor,
whichever way you tell it.

01:30:26.796 --> 01:30:28.173
But you could save her.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:33.603
See, I have a certain code
by which I live.

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:36.515
Anybody who betrays that code,

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.252
betrays the family to which I belong,

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:41.979
they pay the price.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.491
Personal considerations
don't come into it.

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:50.741
No matter how close the relationship.

01:30:53.865 --> 01:30:55.100
You follow me?

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.077
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:30:57.535 --> 01:30:58.728
He doesn't know.

01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:01.798
He has no idea, this smart, $50 shrink.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:05.753
It never entered his head
he was treating the wife of a capo.

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:09.548
And that even the nothing
she told you was too much!

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.673
Operator, get me the police.

01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:28.491
Put...

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:31.845
- Captain.
- Yes?

01:31:31.945 --> 01:31:33.513
I don't know whether it's important,

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:37.893
but an operator just took an emergency call
from a woman in the Lake Forest area.

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:40.478
She hung up
before she got any details or a trace.

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:43.178
So, what am I supposed to do about it?
Put an ad in the newspaper?

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:45.299
No, sir.

01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:48.510
Where were we?

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:53.425
Bertelli. Yeah, thanks.

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:56.077
Great! McGreavy's tracked something.

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.330
Put out a code 10. All cars.

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:00.665
Ruboff! Weaver! Let's go!

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:03.585
Mac thinks Angeli and the mob
are heading for Demarco's plant.

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.128
So tell the SWAT team to move ass.

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:08.607
I want the whole area saturated
and have the house surrounded, too.

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.961
Well, journey's end, huh, Tony?

01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:48.338
Well, yeah, which reminds me.

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:51.817
We've got to find someplace to hide you
away until this thing blows over.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:53.051
Do you have a preference?

01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:55.220
Well, I kind of like the music in Jamaica.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.038
You got it.

01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:08.400
I thought you might like to take a look at
the legitimate side of my business, Doctor.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.093
I deal in garbage.

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.008
Human garbage.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:16.182
Everything that Chicago rejects.

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:20.870
The sacred and profane debris
of a million lives,

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.581
it all finds its way here, Doctor.

01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:25.775
You deal with their minds,

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:30.063
I handle the excretion
of their plastic existence.

01:33:43.827 --> 01:33:45.437
Look at it this way, Doctor.

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:50.859
A heap of discarded ideals,
lost hopes, old loves,

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:55.989
all find their way here eventually to be
carried along this conveyor,

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.512
to the last mouth that will taste them.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.161
I'm sure
you will appreciate the poetic justice

01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:04.122
of such an arrangement, Doctor,
being a sensitive man like myself.

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:07.876
As a matter of fact,
the only difference between you and me

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:11.880
is that you still believe
that human nature is basically good.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.153
Whereas, I have no doubt

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:18.028
that human nature is basically corrupt.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:21.076
Aren't I right, my friend?

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.419
No, don't! Don't!

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:38.924
God, please... Don't!

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:43.244
No, don't.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:44.913
Sorry, my friend,

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:48.124
rogue cops are always
a liability with very limited uses.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:49.350
Don't!

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:52.111
Please.

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:54.943
Don't.

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:04.248
Please don't. Don't do this.

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:16.636
Don't shoot. Just close the door.

01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:13.751
You must find it incredible, Doctor,
that your life is about to end

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:16.400
simply because the wrong woman
walked through your door.

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.065
Right out of the blue.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:26.222
A little puttana of a wife got scared,
told you all our little domestic secrets.

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:28.290
For the last time,
your wife told me nothing.

01:36:28.908 --> 01:36:32.208
But I can't rely on that,
you have to appreciate my position.

01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:35.565
How much do you earn a year, Doctor,
listening to all that garbage?

01:36:35.665 --> 01:36:37.542
Fifty, 75 grand?

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:41.508
I earn that much in one day!

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:44.724
I must protect myself.

01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:50.972
I deal with reality, not dreams, Doctor!

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:04.740
Let him go, Frank.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:08.949
I deal in hard currency.
One rogue policeman,

01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:11.868
a wife,

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:14.249
a $50 shrink.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.072
Frank.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:44.734
Come on!

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:54.581
Come on, psychoanalyst.

01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:25.404
What isn't disposable
is the life I've made.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:41.503
Put them down!

01:38:43.543 --> 01:38:45.069
Come on, move out!

01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:47.071
- Get an ambulance in here!
- Come on, move it!

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:48.448
Come on, hurry up!

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:49.720
Move it!

01:39:22.415 --> 01:39:25.168
That's a hell of a way
to treat a taxpayer.

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:38.666
I was told I could always
find you here on Wednesdays.

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:41.918
Who told you that?

01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:44.797
Your sister-in-law.

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:47.709
I'm Dr. Hadley's patient.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:49.377
He never told me.

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.379
I asked him not to.

01:40:54.173 --> 01:40:55.516
Are you all right now?

01:40:56.384 --> 01:40:59.103
Yes. I'm fine. And you?

01:41:00.805 --> 01:41:02.557
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:41:05.142 --> 01:41:06.394
Why should you be sorry?

01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:10.214
I was the cause of everything, wasn't I?

01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:13.801
If I hadn't consulted you,
you wouldn't have been involved,

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.744
and none of those people would have died.

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:22.494
I'm told you're not practicing anymore.

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:25.626
No. I'm...

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:30.318
I'm writing a book on the nature
of the criminal mind.

01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:33.654
I still make my prison visits

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:36.007
but I don't have private patients anymore.

01:41:36.716 --> 01:41:40.311
Does that now mean you're now allowed
to socialize with ex-patients?

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:42.514
What did you have in mind?

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:46.104
Something risky, like a cup of coffee.

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.151
Well, I...

01:41:49.145 --> 01:41:51.819
I don't think I would
get struck off for that.

01:41:53.024 --> 01:41:58.179
So, my devious sister-in-law
told you where to find me, did she?

01:41:58.279 --> 01:42:00.873
You know, she has
certain theories about me.

01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:03.726
Is she accurate?

01:42:03.826 --> 01:42:05.078
I don't know.

01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:08.835
Maybe you'll find out over a coffee.

01:42:10.207 --> 01:42:12.710
I might even let you analyze me.

01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:17.015
After all, you were
one of my rare successes.

01:42:29.018 --> 01:42:30.270
Bastards!
