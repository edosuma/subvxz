WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:04.518
Doc, how many more adjustments
do you think l'm gonna need?

00:04.680 --> 00:06.875
Well, Mr. Malinkovich, let's see.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.749
My son won't graduate college
till 201 5. . .

00:10.920 --> 00:13.559
. . .so a lot.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.832
See you next time.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.553
Okay, Mr. Dunlop.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.030
lt's good to see you again, sir.
And how are we doing today?

00:24.960 --> 00:28.077
Not good. l was making love
to my wife last night--

00:28.240 --> 00:30.390
Oh, my God, is she okay?

00:30.560 --> 00:32.915
She's fine. She was on top.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.593
But my back went out, doc.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.593
Okay, well, let's get you on the table
and get to work.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.556
Whoa, steady there big fella.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.318
l took some pain pills my wife
had left over from her C-section.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.870
-l guess my legs are a little rubbery.
-Well, how many pills did you take?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.075
Well, let's see.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.995
One when l went to bed,
one when l got up. Seven.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.990
Really? You know it's not usually
a good idea. . .

00:58.160 --> 01:00.116
. . .to pop class A narcotics
like Skittles.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.272
-l gotta lie down.
-Okay, okay, but not here, not now.

01:04.440 --> 01:09.355
No, no, no. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.872
Mr. Dunlop?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.190
Mr. Dunlop, you need to get up.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.475
Help.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.357
Fire.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.552
Big giant guy.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.829
Oh, perfect.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.040 --> 01:41.076
Dr. Harper speaking.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.594
Judith, this is not a good time.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.071
l'm with a patient.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.870
Well, what about Jake?

01:52.040 --> 01:56.352
Well, no, l can't pick him up
at school now. Why can't you do it?

01:56.640 --> 02:00.349
You're not the only one
under pressure, Judith.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.712
All right, all right. l'll call Charlie
and have him pick him up.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.959
Hey, hey, stop that.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.269
Hey, stop that.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.519
Do you need to get it?

02:19.680 --> 02:21.318
No, the machine will pick up.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.029
Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.472
Charlie, I need your help.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.756
Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.831
Oh, for God's sake.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.799
See?

02:46.360 --> 02:47.588
Hey, look who's here.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.352
-Hi.
-How come you're not in school?

02:49.520 --> 02:51.590
He got sent home for misbehaving.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.909
Well, it's about time.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.474
When l was your age,
l had already been arrested twice.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.268
Charlie, don't.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.351
No convictions.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.988
l had a bad day.
l had to cancel all my patients. . .

03:04.160 --> 03:07.152
-. . .and close my office to pick him up.
-Wow, what a drag.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.118
l got new video games.
You wanna play?

03:10.280 --> 03:12.271
-Sure.
-Did you forget you're punished?

03:12.440 --> 03:15.034
No, why does Uncle Charlie
have to suffer?

03:15.840 --> 03:16.829
Go to your room.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.468
ln some countries you're innocent
until proven guilty.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.789
You confessed.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.992
Oh, yeah.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.350
And that country you're thinking of
is this one, genius.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.311
-What did he do?
-Something awful.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.756
How awful?
These are all multi-player games.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.956
Apparently, there is a little girl in
Jake's class named Barbara Schmidt. . .

03:39.120 --> 03:42.908
. . .who is a little more physically
developed than the other girls.

03:43.080 --> 03:47.437
And Jake decided to make a picture
of her and pass it around.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.436
l only passed it to one person.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.309
What happened after that
was not my responsibility.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.991
Dude, why did you sign it?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.394
Okay, that part l regret.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.273
Go back to your room.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.990
''Boobra Schmidt. ''

04:14.160 --> 04:16.435
l'm putting this one
on the refrigerator.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.671
-Charlie, this is serious.
-lt really speaks to me.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.513
The girl went home in tears.
Her mother is on the warpath.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.830
-Jake could get expelled.
-For a silly drawing?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.470
lt's considered sexual harassment.
The school has a zero tolerance policy.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.710
For the good old days
when you could wander. . .

04:31.880 --> 04:34.474
. . .into the girls' locker room
pretending you were blind.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.677
You actually did that?
That's horrible.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.511
No, the horrible part was
stealing the dog from the blind kid.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.311
Well, unfortunately,
times have changed. . .

04:45.480 --> 04:48.040
. . .and we no longer live
in a Porky's movie.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.760
What's a Porky's movie?

04:50.920 --> 04:54.310
Close the door.
l'll be in to talk with you in a minute.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.639
Go easy on him. He doesn't
understand what he did wrong.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.473
He's right. l don't have a clue.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.596
l thought l told you to close the door.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.149
lt is closed.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.309
-Go in your room.
-Fine.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.591
You know what,
maybe l should talk to him.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.273
Oh, now you wanna help?

05:14.400 --> 05:15.753
What's that supposed to mean?

05:15.920 --> 05:17.911
lt means why didn't you
pick up the phone. . .

05:18.080 --> 05:19.991
. . .when l needed you
this afternoon?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.231
l didn't want to.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.111
See, see? l can't depend on you.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.874
l never have been able
to depend on you. l never will be.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.713
-You know why?
-Because l'm undependable?

05:30.920 --> 05:33.673
Yes, yes. Undependable and selfish.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.398
And frankly, l'm the idiot.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.278
l've deluded myself into believing. . .

05:37.440 --> 05:40.512
. . .that when l desperately needed
my brother to pick up my kid. . .

05:40.680 --> 05:43.399
. . .he might actually bother to pick up
the freaking phone.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.515
Okay, okay, in my defense,
l really didn't want to.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.630
Okay, you're right. l'm sorry,
l should have picked up the phone.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.519
Forget it. What's done is done.
No sense grinding on it.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.119
Thank you.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.471
l just have to accept the fact
that l can't count on anyone.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.915
Least of all an emotionally immature
narcissist. . .

06:04.080 --> 06:07.231
. . .who thinks the sun rises out
of his navel, sets in his scrotum. . .

06:07.400 --> 06:10.392
. . .and only cares
about what lies between the two.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.751
Okay, l'm no expert,
but that sounds a lot like grinding.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.353
l am done talking to you.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.478
Oh, come on, Alan, l said l was sorry.
Give me another chance.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.993
For what? To let me down?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.958
Tell me what l can do.
Name something. Anything.

06:25.160 --> 06:29.199
Okay, l have to go to Jake's school
if l can keep him from being expelled.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.510
You want me to go?
l am there. Count on me.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.910
No, my receptionist is out sick
all week.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.958
And l need somebody to handle
the phones while l'm gone.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.917
-ln your office?
-Yes.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.519
Way out in the valley?

06:41.080 --> 06:42.593
Yes.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.193
All day?

06:44.360 --> 06:45.554
Yes.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.836
Gee, tomorrow is not really good
for me.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.759
All right. All right, what time?

06:53.400 --> 06:55.994
-The office opens at 8.
-O'clock?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.670
No, degrees.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.110
No reason to be snide,
l don't wanna be late.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.669
Fine. We leave at 7.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.272
O'clock?

07:11.320 --> 07:14.437
Okay, Charlie, time to get up
and go to work.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.079
Charlie?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.152
Of course.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.312
Never even came home.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.719
Why help your only brother. . .

07:26.880 --> 07:29.678
. . .when you can be out
boffing total strangers?

07:31.400 --> 07:34.312
''l'll be there for you.
You can count on me. ''

07:36.440 --> 07:39.432
My own fault.
l'm just stupid and gullible--

07:39.600 --> 07:41.795
And annoying. Don't forget annoying.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.790
-You're here?
-You said 7:00, right?

07:44.960 --> 07:46.678
-You got yourself up?
-Didn't have to.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.831
-Why not.
-Didn't sleep.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.554
-You haven't been to bed?
-Not my bed.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.188
You want coffee? l made
some coffee. lt's good coffee.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.078
No more coffee.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.238
Why don't you make some more
coffee while l go take a squirt?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.677
-Morning.
-Berta. Berta, Berta, Bert, Bert, Bert.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.755
-He just getting home?
-Yeah.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.708
You gotta wonder how long he'd
keep burning that penis at both ends.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.429
l try not to think about it.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.319
Listen, Charlie's coming with me
to work today.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.710
-Why?
-He's gonna help me at the office.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.472
You wanna bet?

08:22.680 --> 08:24.989
-What's up with Uncle Charlie?
-What do you mean?

08:25.160 --> 08:26.593
He's peeing off the deck.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.513
l thought we weren't allowed
to.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.193
-We're not.
-We're not?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.999
No, we're not.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.635
Okay. What's the Oompa Loompa
doing here on a weekday?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.597
-He got suspended from school.
-Why isn't he with his mother?

08:43.640 --> 08:46.871
Judith had a little liposuction
yesterday. . .

08:47.040 --> 08:48.678
. . .and she needs to stay in bed. . .

08:48.840 --> 08:52.310
. . .until she stops leaking fat.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.637
Yeah, l hate it when that happens.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.676
So, what did the melon-head do?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.229
Oh, it's a long story.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.795
Worth a thousand words.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.713
Come on, Charlie, let's go.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.757
Hang on. l'm not done yet.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.196
Oh, will you leave the sea gulls alone
for crying out loud?

09:16.360 --> 09:17.918
So. . .

09:19.080 --> 09:22.038
. . .you like making fun of girls
with big boobs?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.671
Not anymore.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.549
Gridlock.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.112
Stop.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.638
People do this every day?
Drive to work at eight miles an hour?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.028
Pretty much.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.674
l'd have to kill myself.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.951
-Oh, click.
-What?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.792
l just had a phenomenal
business idea.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.474
They haven't perfected
personal jetpacks yet.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.838
Okay, l have another one.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.077
We buy a doughnut machine
and put it in your trunk.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.553
Let's go back to the jetpacks.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.714
Hear me out. Next time you're stuck
in a traffic jam. . .

10:29.880 --> 10:33.429
. . .just pop your trunk and sell
doughnuts to all the other drivers.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.352
We'll call them. . .

10:35.520 --> 10:37.272
. . .Gridnuts.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.750
Trunk Crullers.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.078
Stop 'n' Go-Nuts.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.389
-Charlie?
-Yeah?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.312
-Please stop talking.
-Okay.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.996
l got it. Trunkin' Donuts.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.428
Here it is. The chiropractic offices
of Dr. Alan Harper.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.758
This is where you come every day?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.797
Yep. For 1 1 years.
What do you think?

11:15.160 --> 11:18.152
l would have killed myself
1 0 and a half years ago.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.677
Okay. Now, all you have to do
is sit here.

11:22.840 --> 11:27.152
And when the phone rings, pick it up
and say, ''Dr. Harper's office. ''

11:27.320 --> 11:28.639
So right off the bat, l lie?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.674
l am a doctor, Charlie.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.990
Yeah, and l'm king
of the traffic doughnuts.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.789
Moving on. l've canceled
all the morning appointments. . .

11:42.960 --> 11:45.349
. . .the only thing you're gonna
deal with is walk-ins.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.715
Have them make an appointment
for another time.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.155
So l don't get to crack
anybody's back?

11:50.320 --> 11:54.393
Charlie, listen to me very carefully.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.757
You must not touch the patients.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.031
This is not me talking.
This is the State of California.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.474
-Okay.
-Let me be absolutely clear.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.956
No touching the patients.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.718
Got it.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.388
What did l just say to you?
Repeat it back to me.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.233
Boy, you're really not
a morning person, are you?

12:18.440 --> 12:20.510
All right, l gotta go
get to Jake's school.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.069
Say a prayer that l can keep him
from being expelled.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.516
Don't worry about a thing. lt's
under control. You can count on me.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.558
Oh, if l could believe
even one of those things.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.638
Okay. Where can l hang myself?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.919
Hello.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.158
Oh, hey, Alan.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.148
l said, ''Dr. Harper's office. ''

13:19.320 --> 13:20.833
l did.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.719
You know what, call back
and give me another chance.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.109
Hello. Damn, try it again.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.233
-Are you waiting to see the principal?
-Yeah.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.039
-Oh, have a seat.
-Oh, thank you.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.917
-Alan.
-Mindy.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.389
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.955
You must be Boobra's mom.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.831
Barbara's mams.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.513
Hi.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.878
Don't worry, Alan.
l'm not touching the patients.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.272
There are human lives
at stake here, man.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.398
l need those spines delivered
immediately.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.078
Hello. Can l give you
a complimentary adjustment?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.472
l'm here for the masseuse position.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.355
l see. Well, l'm really not authorized
to do any hiring. . .

14:50.520 --> 14:53.432
. . .but you're obviously qualified.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.514
So the hell with protocol,
welcome aboard.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.597
Let me tell you, puberty is
hard enough for a young girl. . .

15:03.760 --> 15:07.639
. . .without having to be leered at and
made fun of by obnoxious little boys.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.950
l couldn't agree with you more.
l assure you. . .

15:10.120 --> 15:13.635
. . .l've had a talk with Jake about how
wrong it is to objectify women's--

15:13.800 --> 15:16.553
Up here. l'm up here.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.273
l know. l know. l see you.
And let me tell you something.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.476
There is no one more sympathetic
than l. . .

15:23.640 --> 15:25.835
. . .to the plight
of the large-breasted woman.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.631
Plight? lt's not an affliction.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.270
Well, no, not the breasts themselves
but the attendant back problems. . .

15:33.440 --> 15:36.512
. . .associated with carrying
the enormous load.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.228
So now my breasts are a load?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.193
From a strictly engineering standpoint,
yes.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.553
See, see, l am a chiropractor.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.234
And l deal with the heartache
of MMS all the time.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.868
-MMS?
-Massive Mammary Syndrome.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.351
A term l coined in an article
l submitted. . .

15:54.520 --> 15:57.318
. . .to the Journal of the American
Chiropractic Association.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.198
lt hasn't really caught on.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.318
Anyway, MMS is particularly acute
among strippers. . .

16:02.480 --> 16:06.189
. . .but they bring it on themselves
with those humongous implants.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.555
Yours, on the other hand,
appear quite natural.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.711
God given, am l right?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.872
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.439
l don't know.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.150
l was a bottle baby.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.555
l'm sorry, Dr. Harper's
not in this morning.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.553
lf your back's bothering you,
we do have a masseuse on duty.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.119
Fine. Anything.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.352
Let's see, she just went in with
a patient about five minutes ago.

16:41.520 --> 16:45.149
-So if you don't mind waiting--
-Thank you, that was great.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.393
Good. Come back soon.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.074
Soon? l'll be back after lunch.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.235
-You next?
-Oh, please.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.799
Let's go.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.871
-What's this?
-Your cut.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.557
Click!

17:06.800 --> 17:09.314
-l am really sorry.
-Just drop it.

17:11.319 --> 17:15.472
You know, in my defense--
Well, well, in the defense of all men. . .

17:15.640 --> 17:17.915
. . .we do live in a mammo-centric
society.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.519
Mammo-centric?

17:20.720 --> 17:22.233
Another coinage of mine.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.188
Hasn't really permeated
the cultural Zeitgeist.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.635
Hey, bottle baby, l'm up here.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.232
That perfectly illustrates my points.
Point.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.508
From the moment we are born, we are
basically bombarded by breasts.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.279
Breasts in advertising,
breasts in television, in movies.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.637
Here a breast, there a breast,
everywhere a breast-breast.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.316
Heck, you can understand
the fixation.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.190
You're a horrible little man.

17:52.040 --> 17:55.669
Okay, l had hoped that we could have
a spirited exchange of ideas here.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.559
But if we are gonna just degenerate
into name-calling. . . .

17:58.720 --> 18:02.269
. . .we should wait for the principal to
decide what a reasonable punishment. . .

18:02.440 --> 18:05.318
-. . .for my son would be.
-Fine. We'll let the principal decide.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.833
Okay.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.836
l'm Principal Gallagher.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.238
Oh, God,
my boy's gonna get the chair.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.192
Time.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.030
Man, is this day ever gonna end?

18:33.360 --> 18:34.554
Hey, Alan.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.429
What's going on here?

18:39.600 --> 18:41.352
l had another business idea.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.551
-You what?
-Hear me out.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.188
What do men like better
than doughnuts?

18:49.480 --> 18:51.198
Hang on.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.352
Time.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.637
Four thousand two hundred,
4300, 301 , 302--

19:05.800 --> 19:08.360
l hate singles.
Don't you hate singles?

19:08.520 --> 19:12.115
You turned my business
into a brothel.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.272
l thought you'd be proud of me.
l didn't touch a single patient.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.074
l left you alone
for a couple of hours. . .

19:18.240 --> 19:20.834
. . .and you turned my business
into a brothel.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.029
You know what you need?
A nice, relaxing massage.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.674
Oh, shut up.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.239
There is a happy ending here.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.630
From what l saw,
there was like 40 of them.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.155
And that's just what's on the books.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.949
l don't want to know about it.
l never wanna know about it.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.350
-Okay, we'll change the subject.
-Thank you.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.478
-How did it go at Jake's school?
-l don't want to talk about it.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.358
l never wanna talk about it.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.990
-You screwed up, huh?
-ln ways you can't imagine.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.519
So he's expelled?

19:50.720 --> 19:53.075
No, he's just suspended
for the week.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.913
That's not so bad.
lt's already Wednesday.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.911
l have been asked never to set foot. . .

19:58.080 --> 20:00.753
. . .on the grounds of Woodward
Avenue Elementary School.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.592
-No kidding.
-And it was suggested. . .

20:02.760 --> 20:04.637
. . .that l resign from the PTA.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.791
And there's talk of a civil suit.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.791
Principal Gallagher's lesbian lover. . .

20:08.960 --> 20:11.428
. . .might just drop by tonight
to kick my ass.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.238
Remind me to charge the camcorder.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.356
Oh, click, another great business idea.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.238
-l don't wanna hear it.
-Just listen.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.595
We put a massage table
in the trunk of your car.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.876
-Forget it, Charlie.
-We'd probably need a van.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.632
-l'm not listening.
-Oh, come on.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.395
Who needs their tension relieved
more than guys stuck in traffic?

20:28.560 --> 20:32.109
We'll call it,
Bumper to Humper.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.076
Speed Humps.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.549
l got it. Jiffy Lube.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.190
Oh, wait, somebody already has that.
