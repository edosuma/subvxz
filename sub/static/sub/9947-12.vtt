00:01.168 --> 00:04.247
Anyone thinking we know fuck all
needs to watch their back.

00:08.151 --> 00:11.270
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.271 --> 00:13.030
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.031 --> 00:17.030
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:17.259 --> 00:19.857
Now you've
got your ConDemNation...

00:19.858 --> 00:23.297
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.298 --> 00:27.177
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.178 --> 00:30.697
Is revolution a word or was it never?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.777
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:32.778 --> 00:36.057
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.058 --> 00:38.377
Well, for fuck's sake,

00:38.378 --> 00:42.297
we live in Manchester
and they charge us for water!

00:42.298 --> 00:48.132
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.133 --> 00:51.852
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times,

00:51.853 --> 00:53.730
yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak!

00:54.095 --> 00:57.374
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.854
This is our England now.

01:00.054 --> 01:07.254

01:07.292 --> 01:09.211
My family's everything to me.

01:09.212 --> 01:10.731
They are me.

01:10.732 --> 01:12.851
I made them.

01:12.852 --> 01:16.091
Made them strong and resilient.

01:16.092 --> 01:19.891
It's a mother's duty to prepare kids
for the harsh realities of life.

01:19.892 --> 01:21.411
I mean, it's not easy, is it?

01:21.412 --> 01:24.771
Taught them from day one,
it's family first.

01:24.772 --> 01:27.611
I'll stick this up your fucking arse.

01:27.612 --> 01:30.331
To look out for each other,
watch each other's backs.

01:30.332 --> 01:33.051
Cos as we all know,
blood's thicker than water.

01:33.052 --> 01:36.291
I doubt you'd find it.
You missed every other fucking hole.

01:36.292 --> 01:39.091
And you know what?
They're a credit to me.

01:39.092 --> 01:41.571
Shut up, Micky!

01:41.572 --> 01:45.571
Mum!

01:45.852 --> 01:47.091
Fuck's sake!

01:47.092 --> 01:49.771
Shouldn't have got in the way,
then, should you?!

01:49.772 --> 01:50.971
Shift, soft arse!

01:50.972 --> 01:52.691
Family is everything.

01:52.692 --> 01:55.651
Family's the be-all and end-all.

01:55.652 --> 01:57.131
The start and the finish.

01:57.132 --> 02:00.651
Family is king.

02:00.652 --> 02:02.971
Even when the King's
long since departed,

02:02.972 --> 02:05.011
family lives on.

02:05.012 --> 02:09.011
And the hard fist
that keeps you in line.

02:14.412 --> 02:16.171
I've had to leave it
parked round there.

02:16.172 --> 02:18.051
You'll have to sort
this with the brewery.

02:18.052 --> 02:19.491
I ain't got that kind of cash on me.

02:19.492 --> 02:22.851
Been fine to park here for years.
Who the fuck's clamped it?

02:22.852 --> 02:25.331
Comes to something when
you can't get a tit roll

02:25.332 --> 02:29.331
without your vehicle
being impounded.

02:34.252 --> 02:37.691
That wasn't tackling, you were trying to
put me in hospital. You saw it, Mark.

02:37.692 --> 02:40.691
Went in heavier than a fuckin'
prop forward. It's footy, not rugby.

02:40.692 --> 02:43.371
Stop whining, you losers.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.531
Defend yourself.
Should've given the bastard a slap.

02:46.532 --> 02:47.251
It's a game.

02:47.252 --> 02:48.411
A game with rules.

02:48.412 --> 02:50.211
Forget them and you're fucked.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.251
We're all fucked.

02:51.252 --> 02:52.651
Get real, will you, Jackson.

02:52.652 --> 02:56.091
The world's full of no marks like
him, waiting to take what's yours.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.131
Don't get me wrong,

02:57.132 --> 02:59.571
try it again in the replay
and I'll have you.

02:59.572 --> 03:00.491
You reckon?

03:00.492 --> 03:01.691
Anyone can make a mistake,

03:01.692 --> 03:03.811
but do it again
and I'll eat you alive.

03:03.812 --> 03:05.531
That's more like it.

03:05.532 --> 03:06.611
You know it.

03:06.612 --> 03:07.451
Quick scoop before you head off?

03:07.452 --> 03:09.251
Too right. Ches!

03:09.252 --> 03:12.531
Nah, mate, got an early start.

03:12.532 --> 03:15.451
Jackson...
better luck next time, lad.

03:15.452 --> 03:17.291
Surprised you asked him.

03:17.292 --> 03:17.971
Why?

03:17.972 --> 03:21.971
His lot don't drink, do they?

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:37.012 --> 03:40.811
Well, at least there's one name.
I think it's one name.

03:40.812 --> 03:43.891
Conchita Maria Teresa
Bonnita Ricardo Martinez.

03:43.892 --> 03:46.531
No, that's me.
Just wanted to get the ball rolling.

03:46.532 --> 03:49.491
I thought you were doing
a course on wiping babies arses.

03:49.492 --> 03:53.491
Doing drama, contemporary dance
and needlecraft now.

03:54.932 --> 03:55.851
Needlecraft?

03:55.852 --> 03:57.731
Got to put a variety show on.

03:57.732 --> 04:00.491
The best act gets to
perform in front of a Royal.

04:00.492 --> 04:02.691
So long as it's not Edward,
or that ginger one.

04:02.692 --> 04:05.731
Or Charles. Or Willy. The one
with the teeth and the horses.

04:05.732 --> 04:07.851
Or the old Greek one.
Or the other ginger one.

04:07.852 --> 04:10.731
I just want to win it. All that
lot think I'm a right retard.

04:10.732 --> 04:12.971
The Student's Union only
thought I was there

04:12.972 --> 04:15.131
as part of a
mental health awareness week.

04:15.132 --> 04:16.930
Am I the only one serving here?

04:16.932 --> 04:17.731
Yeah.

04:17.732 --> 04:18.771
Cheeky fuckers.

04:18.772 --> 04:20.971
You got showbiz
running through your veins.

04:20.971 --> 04:23.451
Got a lot of stuff running
through his veins, Mimi,

04:23.452 --> 04:25.131
I don't know if any of it's showbiz.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.851
My brother, his Uncle Robert,
toured the clubs as a magician,

04:27.852 --> 04:29.051
and worked the liners too.

04:29.052 --> 04:30.131
Uncle Bobbi, yeah...

04:30.132 --> 04:30.731
Robert.

04:30.732 --> 04:32.891
I remember him saying
cruising was his life.

04:32.892 --> 04:34.331
In the magic ring and all that.

04:34.332 --> 04:35.171
Circle.

04:35.172 --> 04:36.931
How come I've never met him?

04:36.932 --> 04:40.251
I got married, moved away and he
had his career... Showbiz pals.

04:40.252 --> 04:43.331
I loved the bones of him
but we moved in different worlds.

04:43.332 --> 04:46.091
He was globe-trotting
and I was rearing a family.

04:46.092 --> 04:47.051
You should get in touch.

04:47.052 --> 04:50.611
You should get in touch.
Do you think I haven't tried?

04:50.612 --> 04:52.051
With ya now, love.

04:52.052 --> 04:54.411
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

04:54.412 --> 04:58.411
Crack.

05:00.732 --> 05:04.731
Jesus, what charity is it this time?

05:07.172 --> 05:08.291
You serious?

05:08.292 --> 05:09.371
BAP.

05:09.372 --> 05:10.251
Tit?

05:10.252 --> 05:11.651
BAP.
Tit?

05:11.652 --> 05:14.531
BAP.

05:14.532 --> 05:15.891
BAP.

05:15.892 --> 05:17.571
British Alliance Party.

05:17.572 --> 05:19.891
Raffle tickets
for their social club.

05:19.892 --> 05:21.931
Wouldn't thought you'd
fit their demograph.

05:21.932 --> 05:23.691
And why would that be?

05:23.692 --> 05:27.691
On account of you being black,
black, black, black and black.

05:28.452 --> 05:30.651
That's not what they're about.

05:30.652 --> 05:33.531
Compulsory repatriation,
a complete ban on immigration,

05:33.532 --> 05:35.691
and laws discriminating
against gays and women.

05:35.692 --> 05:37.011
What else could they be about?

05:37.012 --> 05:37.731
Whatever.

05:37.732 --> 05:41.731
See ya.

05:44.292 --> 05:47.131
Jamie's doing his nut.
You shouldn't have clamped him.

05:47.132 --> 05:48.331
Bastards.

05:48.332 --> 05:50.931
Err, WE shouldn't've clamped him,
Micky.

05:50.932 --> 05:53.491
That's me, you
and Manchester Clamping Solutions.

05:53.492 --> 05:56.051
He won't pay up, will he?
You know what he's like.

05:56.052 --> 05:57.091
Who gives a shit?

05:57.092 --> 05:58.251
I do.

05:58.252 --> 05:59.971
I put money into it, I've got a say.

05:59.972 --> 06:01.011
No, you haven't.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.411
You're a silent partner.

06:02.412 --> 06:04.611
Now shut the fuck up.

06:04.612 --> 06:06.411
It'll kick off.

06:06.412 --> 06:09.211
For fuck's sake,
stop whining, will ya?

06:09.212 --> 06:10.531
I'll take it off, all right.

06:10.532 --> 06:13.331
Why do you and Jamie always have
to have a pop at each other?

06:13.332 --> 06:16.131
Why can't you just get on?
You're brothers, for fuck sake.

06:16.132 --> 06:18.291
Nothing more than a biological
accident, Micky.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.971
If I hadn't been
the fastest swimmer

06:19.972 --> 06:22.931
or Dad decided to have one off the
wrist instead of impregnating Mam,

06:22.932 --> 06:25.091
we wouldn't even be
having this conversation.

06:25.092 --> 06:27.411
Look, Jamie is a cunt.

06:27.412 --> 06:30.731
A prize cunt who thinks and cares
about no-one other than himself.

06:30.732 --> 06:32.251
Believe.

06:32.252 --> 06:36.251
Fuck's sake!

06:40.612 --> 06:41.851
Fucking amateurs.

06:41.852 --> 06:43.051
Won't they charge you more?

06:43.052 --> 06:46.011
You'll be destroying their property
and them clamps aren't cheap.

06:46.012 --> 06:47.491
It's a scam.

06:47.492 --> 06:50.771
You get yourself a phoney license,
stick a few photocopied signs up.

06:50.772 --> 06:51.971
You're wrong there, Jamie...

06:51.972 --> 06:55.051
They're subcontracted and endorsed
by Manchester Clamping Solutions

06:55.052 --> 06:57.051
and are operating according
to local by-laws

06:57.052 --> 06:58.531
and governmental legislations.

06:58.532 --> 06:59.611
How the fuck would you know?

06:59.612 --> 07:01.371
I heard it somewhere.

07:01.372 --> 07:03.731
Why don't you go back in the pub,
I'll handle this.

07:03.732 --> 07:04.811
You?

07:04.812 --> 07:08.171
You don't want to mess with these
guys, Jamie. I've seen them.

07:08.172 --> 07:11.411
You've seen them?
What do they look like?

07:11.412 --> 07:13.211
About that big.

07:13.212 --> 07:14.411
Chinese.

07:14.412 --> 07:16.971
Triads. Hard fuckers.

07:16.972 --> 07:20.091
Micky, do me a favour, will ya?

07:20.092 --> 07:22.051
Look, this is too dangerous.

07:22.052 --> 07:23.651
We can't afford to lose you.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.371
I'll handle it,
you go back in there.

07:26.372 --> 07:28.611
You'll make Connor an orphan,

07:28.612 --> 07:31.971
the poor kid will grow up
not knowing his dad.

07:31.972 --> 07:35.091
I'll talk about you, obviously,
and keep your memory alive, but...

07:35.092 --> 07:39.011
Micky, will you fuck off?!

07:39.012 --> 07:41.251
Oi, the fuck you doing?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.771
It's all right, I'm on it.

07:42.772 --> 07:45.531
That's my property.

07:45.532 --> 07:49.131
You? Thought you said it
belonged to a Chinese dwarf?

07:49.132 --> 07:50.291
No, it's my new business.

07:50.292 --> 07:52.211
It's all sorted now. No harm done.

07:52.212 --> 07:54.931
You're parked illegally,
you've damaged a clamp.

07:54.932 --> 07:55.971
That'll be 70 quid.

07:55.972 --> 07:57.051
In your dreams.

07:57.052 --> 07:59.491
Pay the fine,
or I'll just keep putting it on.

07:59.492 --> 08:00.931
And I'll just keep cutting it off.

08:00.932 --> 08:02.211
I'll pay it.

08:02.212 --> 08:04.451
Keep your fucking nose out.

08:04.452 --> 08:07.691
I won't tell you again.

08:07.692 --> 08:09.131
Fuck do you think you are?

08:09.132 --> 08:11.491
He's your brother, you know,
we're brothers!

08:11.492 --> 08:14.211
The guy who's about to reach down
and rip out your fucking lungs.

08:14.212 --> 08:17.851
That's enough!

08:17.852 --> 08:21.851
Oh, for fuck's sake.

08:28.772 --> 08:30.131
Guess who won the raffle?

08:30.132 --> 08:31.091
Fix.

08:31.092 --> 08:32.530
Heil Hitler.

08:32.532 --> 08:36.051
What the fuck?

08:36.052 --> 08:37.571
What've you won?

08:37.572 --> 08:41.571
Dinner at the Meat
and Two Veg restaurant.

08:41.772 --> 08:42.890
In Burnley.

08:42.892 --> 08:44.611
Fucking Burnley?!

08:44.612 --> 08:46.891
All home grown produce,
British beef.

08:46.892 --> 08:49.091
Ever heard
of Stockholm Syndrome, Jackson?

08:49.092 --> 08:52.011
They're not brainwashing me.
It's sport, not politics.

08:52.012 --> 08:54.291
They're decent people
once you get to know them.

08:54.292 --> 08:57.531
They used to say the same thing
about Mengele, "He's not too bad

08:57.532 --> 09:00.971
"once you scratch the surface,
get over that whole genocide thing."

09:00.972 --> 09:04.211
They just want us
to look after ourselves.

09:04.212 --> 09:05.251
Brits.

09:05.252 --> 09:07.931
State the economy's in,
charity begins at home.

09:07.932 --> 09:11.931
We need to take care of our own
before we can help anybody else.

09:13.572 --> 09:16.291
He'll be invading Poland next.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.011
How do you think?

09:18.012 --> 09:19.691
Karen, get him some water.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.771
What are you up to?

09:22.772 --> 09:26.171
They're obliged by law to accept
membership from all walks of life...

09:26.172 --> 09:29.171
black, Asian, gay, whatever -
and I want to see if they will.

09:29.172 --> 09:31.171
I want to see
if they genuinely accept me

09:31.172 --> 09:32.971
or they're just paying lip service.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.211
And what if they are?

09:34.212 --> 09:36.931
Then I expose the
two-faced Fascist bastards

09:36.932 --> 09:38.971
for who they are and close 'em down.

09:38.972 --> 09:41.691
Thought we were going to
have to call an ambulance.

09:41.692 --> 09:42.651
Do you want 'owt getting, mate?

09:42.652 --> 09:43.931
I bit me tongue.

09:43.932 --> 09:45.531
How could you do this to your own?

09:45.532 --> 09:48.371
This wouldn't have happened if
Shane hadn't have clamped the van.

09:48.372 --> 09:49.451
Jamie should've paid up.

09:49.452 --> 09:51.371
What's it got to do with you,
little Hitler?

09:51.372 --> 09:53.731
We're business partners.

09:53.732 --> 09:55.491
Business partners.

09:55.492 --> 09:57.531
Your brother's
sitting here concussed

09:57.532 --> 09:59.651
and you're still
tearing at each other.

09:59.652 --> 10:02.611
What's it going to take
for you to grow the fuck up?!

10:02.612 --> 10:05.771
I'm ashamed to call you family!

10:05.772 --> 10:09.771
I recognise those dulcet tones.

10:14.612 --> 10:15.611
Robert?

10:15.612 --> 10:17.171
You came. Uncle Robert!

10:17.172 --> 10:19.211
Bobbi, with an I.

10:19.212 --> 10:23.211
Like Liza.
Minnelli, that is, not Tarbuck.

10:23.852 --> 10:27.851
No kiss for your little sis?

10:33.252 --> 10:37.251
Fuck me.

10:37.778 --> 10:39.521
I'm sorry to hear
about you and Paddy.

10:39.522 --> 10:41.360
You hated the fuckin' sight of him.

10:41.361 --> 10:44.720
Well, true enough.
Micky traced me down via my agent,

10:44.721 --> 10:48.720
said you'd been looking for me.
Said you'd been missing me.

10:48.841 --> 10:50.400
I missed you too, you know.

10:50.401 --> 10:53.560
Just one minute
you were seeing that gobshite,

10:53.561 --> 10:55.840
next minute you were up the duff,
married,

10:55.841 --> 10:57.520
then at the wrong end of the M62.

10:57.521 --> 10:58.640
Whirlwind romance.

10:58.641 --> 11:00.000
Shotgun wedding.

11:00.001 --> 11:03.000
You know, I did try
and keep in touch

11:03.001 --> 11:04.960
I did a few gigs here,
years back.

11:04.961 --> 11:07.000
Gave you a knock,
but you were never in.

11:07.001 --> 11:10.240
Meems!

11:10.241 --> 11:11.120
Shhh!

11:11.121 --> 11:12.160
Shhh!

11:12.161 --> 11:16.160
Did write.

11:17.841 --> 11:21.040
I just thought you were
dropping a hint. So I took it.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.400
You're my baby brother.

11:22.401 --> 11:25.800
If only we had mobiles
in them days, eh? E-mails..

11:25.801 --> 11:27.440
Well, we're here now, aren't we?

11:27.441 --> 11:30.920
Hepburn sisters,
back together again at last.

11:30.921 --> 11:34.880
I'll be Audrey, you can be the
one with the voice like a man.

11:34.881 --> 11:36.120
Robert, listen.

11:36.121 --> 11:37.160
I hate to say this but...

11:37.161 --> 11:39.600
Bobbi. Nobody's called me
Robert in an age.

11:39.601 --> 11:40.640
Bob...

11:40.641 --> 11:41.720
Bob...
..Bi.

11:41.721 --> 11:42.000
Bob...

11:42.001 --> 11:43.560
Bob...
..Bi.

11:43.561 --> 11:46.000
Bobbi, it might be an idea

11:46.001 --> 11:50.000
to tone down the whole
showbiz angle while you're here.

11:50.681 --> 11:53.320
Just cut the camp shit.
People round here

11:53.321 --> 11:55.720
like the women to be women
and the men to be men.

11:55.721 --> 11:57.880
Don't we all! No, I hear you.

11:57.881 --> 11:59.320
I hear you.

11:59.321 --> 12:01.000
Good.

12:01.001 --> 12:02.280
Suitcase is at ours.

12:02.281 --> 12:05.520
No brother of mine's
staying in a scabby B&B.

12:05.521 --> 12:08.320
Micky's on the couch,
you'll have his room.

12:08.321 --> 12:10.080
(Did you change the sheets?)

12:10.081 --> 12:11.120
Yeah.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.120
(Get rid of the wanky hankies?)

12:13.121 --> 12:15.400
Thanks, Micky love.
That's very kind of you.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.200
You're family.
The only other uncles I've got

12:18.201 --> 12:22.200
are either dead or in,
erm...Argentina.

12:24.881 --> 12:25.960
I need to get back to work.

12:25.961 --> 12:28.040
How about I take my favourite nephew

12:28.041 --> 12:32.040
for a proper drink,
a real drink? C'mon.

12:34.241 --> 12:38.240
Two days max and he's out of here.
Get that?

12:43.761 --> 12:46.280
Shane.

12:46.281 --> 12:47.880
You kept that fucking quiet.

12:47.881 --> 12:50.680
Yeah, when I was a kid, I always
thought he was the magician

12:50.681 --> 12:51.720
not the fucking assistant.

12:51.721 --> 12:52.760
What's the big deal?

12:52.761 --> 12:55.360
He looks like a woman.

12:55.361 --> 12:57.240
Mam's sung his praises for years.

12:57.241 --> 12:58.560
Why wouldn't she
mention he was a tranny?

12:58.561 --> 13:00.440
It obviously
doesn't matter to her.

13:00.441 --> 13:03.120
They were dead happy
to see each other.

13:03.121 --> 13:07.120
He's the only family she's got
besides you lot. Don't spoil it.

13:08.081 --> 13:09.560
What the fuck is that supposed to be?

13:09.561 --> 13:11.200
(PATTY) Transvestite.

13:11.201 --> 13:13.240
A man who likes to eat, drink,

13:13.241 --> 13:14.800
and be Mary.

13:14.801 --> 13:17.960
It takes balls to be a tranny.
And a penis.

13:17.961 --> 13:19.000
I should know.

13:19.001 --> 13:21.120
What big hands you've got!

13:23.801 --> 13:26.160
LAUGHTER

13:26.161 --> 13:28.520
Have I got cunt
written on my forehead?

13:28.521 --> 13:29.560
No, Mimi.

13:29.561 --> 13:33.280
Then don't treat me like one
and the same goes for my sist...

13:33.281 --> 13:37.280
brother.

13:38.081 --> 13:39.920
Spread the word.

13:39.921 --> 13:43.920
Cheers.

13:47.561 --> 13:48.040
8, please, guys.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.600
Third cup replay
we've lost on the trot.

13:50.601 --> 13:52.720
We need to up the training regime...

13:52.721 --> 13:54.920
few less lagers
and a few more 5k runs.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.280
10k runs.

13:56.281 --> 13:58.000
We'll put a programme together.

13:58.001 --> 14:00.680
Still time to finish
the season with a bit of dignity.

14:00.681 --> 14:02.280
That's what I like -
a bit of positivity.

14:02.281 --> 14:03.280
A bit of delusion.

14:03.281 --> 14:06.520
There you go.

14:06.521 --> 14:07.800
Eh, lads,

14:07.801 --> 14:10.040
what do blondes say after sex?

14:10.041 --> 14:10.960
Thanks, guys.

14:10.961 --> 14:11.960
LAUGHTER

14:11.961 --> 14:13.960
Lads, we're off for a bit of scran
if you fancy it?

14:13.961 --> 14:15.800
We've got plans. Where are you off?

14:15.801 --> 14:17.680
Chinky.

14:17.681 --> 14:20.600
Prick!

14:20.601 --> 14:21.840
It's a joke.

14:21.841 --> 14:24.520
Like the one
you just laughed along with.

14:24.521 --> 14:27.640
Come on, mate. He's just having
a bit of fun. It's just a word.

14:27.641 --> 14:30.080
Yeah, like Paki or nigger.

14:30.081 --> 14:32.600
That never fails to
have me pissing myself >

14:32.601 --> 14:34.880
laughing every time
I hear it, eh, Jackson?

14:34.881 --> 14:38.880
Rolling on the floor.
Splitting my fuckin' sides.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.720
Everyone knows he's in the wrong.
Shane's a dickhead. You're smarter.

14:52.361 --> 14:54.880
Just shrug it off
for the sake of the family.

14:54.881 --> 14:56.360
The bigger man walks away.

14:56.361 --> 14:58.600
You know you're right.
We know you're right.

14:58.601 --> 14:59.920
It's not like losing face.

14:59.921 --> 15:03.920
It's another bit of hassle
we could do without. Please. For me.

15:07.681 --> 15:09.200
OK. For you.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.040
My little West End Wendy!

15:11.240 --> 15:12.440
Now, I don't wanna *** in ya,

15:12.921 --> 15:14.720
but you've got a show in a few days

15:14.721 --> 15:17.120
and you haven't got
one fucking act. So...

15:17.121 --> 15:19.080
Can I get everyone's
attention, please?

15:19.081 --> 15:21.200
Now, anyone with an artistic flair

15:21.201 --> 15:24.480
that they don't mind showing -
nothing pornographic...

15:24.481 --> 15:27.920
can sign up to perform
in Micky's Variety Show.

15:27.921 --> 15:31.920
This is your chance to show us...

15:33.481 --> 15:36.560
what you can do.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.200
Oh, forgot to say.

15:38.201 --> 15:42.200
Anyone who is participating,
it's free ale all night.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.960
What the fuck you doing?
I can't shell out for this.

15:44.961 --> 15:46.920
You don't have to.
Charge on the door.

15:46.921 --> 15:48.960
You'll make your money back
in no time.

15:48.961 --> 15:49.960
Mum, sort this out, will you?

15:49.961 --> 15:51.120
Oh, Mimi,

15:51.121 --> 15:55.120
isn't he gorgeous when he's riled?
If I wasn't his auntie...

16:10.241 --> 16:12.040
You all right?

16:12.041 --> 16:12.840
Why wouldn't I be?

16:12.841 --> 16:13.960
You don't look like

16:13.961 --> 16:16.360
someone who's found
their long-lost brother,

16:16.361 --> 16:18.000
the one you said you worshipped.

16:18.001 --> 16:19.000
I'm made up to see him.

16:19.001 --> 16:22.240
So made up, you want him
out the house in 24 hours?

16:22.241 --> 16:23.280
Drop it, eh? >

16:23.281 --> 16:25.840
Leave it, Micky!

16:25.841 --> 16:27.840
Karen says she needs
some more vodka,

16:27.841 --> 16:31.840
crisps and nuts from the cellar.

16:38.881 --> 16:42.880
Gullibility obviously
runs in the family.

16:45.241 --> 16:46.600
Micky!

16:48.441 --> 16:52.440
Just sort it.

16:57.281 --> 17:00.880
He reckons it's time
me and you had a talk.

17:00.881 --> 17:04.880
And I think he's right.

17:18.401 --> 17:19.640
All the wives take their turn.

17:19.641 --> 17:22.599
Ah, that is so considerate. Thanks.

17:22.601 --> 17:26.599
Otherwise it means one person ends up
doing the whole lot, week after week.

17:26.721 --> 17:30.720
Which wouldn't be right
at all, would it?

17:31.241 --> 17:32.320
Oops.

17:32.321 --> 17:33.640
Oh, for fuck's...

17:33.641 --> 17:36.720
I do yours out of some
misplaced sense of obligation.

17:36.721 --> 17:40.720
The SS can do their own.

17:42.881 --> 17:44.840
They take turns cooking
for each other too.

17:44.841 --> 17:46.440
Fuck right off!

17:46.441 --> 17:48.440
It'll help me infiltrate the group!

17:48.441 --> 17:51.640
You're a trainee teacher,
not a member of MI-bleeding-5.

17:51.641 --> 17:52.800
No way.
Please.

17:52.801 --> 17:53.880
No!

17:53.881 --> 17:55.160
If I stand any chance
of bringing them down...

17:55.161 --> 17:57.560
And who put you in
charge of social justice?

17:57.561 --> 17:59.320
Someone needs to make a stand.

17:59.321 --> 18:01.360
And that someone is you?!

18:01.361 --> 18:04.800
Jackson, you can't even
put a fucking shelf up!

18:04.801 --> 18:06.560
They're coming for dinner tonight.

18:06.561 --> 18:08.880
DOOR CLOSES

18:08.881 --> 18:12.240
WATER TRICKLES

18:12.241 --> 18:14.720
What are you fucking doing?

18:14.721 --> 18:16.880
That vodka's gone right through me -
I'm pissing like a shire horse.

18:16.881 --> 18:19.560
Well, I don't want to
see your dangly bits!

18:19.561 --> 18:23.560
Try standing up against the wall
and doing it like a normal man!

18:23.721 --> 18:25.720
Normal? And what the fuck is normal?

18:25.721 --> 18:26.680
Certainly not you.

18:26.681 --> 18:28.720
You have no idea what
it's like to be me...

18:28.721 --> 18:31.560
You're not the only one
with facial hair and haemorrhoids.

18:31.561 --> 18:33.000
..how bad my life was
when you pissed off!

18:33.001 --> 18:34.360
At least you had a life!

18:34.361 --> 18:37.800
All my life was spent
coping with being your sister,

18:37.801 --> 18:41.480
while you were swanning round being
Quentin fuckin' Crisp.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.480
I had to deal with the fallout!

18:43.481 --> 18:45.760
Quentin fuckin' Crisp?!
I'm not a gay man.

18:45.761 --> 18:49.280
I'm a woman, OK, born with a cock.

18:49.281 --> 18:51.120
Definition of a woman
with a cock - man.

18:51.121 --> 18:52.480
I feel like a woman inside!

18:52.481 --> 18:55.640
Oh, yeah? Well, I feel like
bleedin' Pamela Anderson inside,

18:55.641 --> 18:59.120
but not much chance of you seeing
me in fuckin' Baywatch, is there?!

18:59.121 --> 19:00.640
I'm a woman!

19:00.641 --> 19:01.680
Cock!

19:01.681 --> 19:02.320
Woman!

19:02.321 --> 19:03.440
Woman!
Cock!

19:03.441 --> 19:03.640
Woman!

19:03.641 --> 19:07.480
Woman!
Cock, cock, cock.

19:07.481 --> 19:11.120
Fighting your battles for you,
defending you

19:11.121 --> 19:13.840
while you pranced round
the streets in Ma's heels!

19:13.841 --> 19:17.840
You were a self-indulgent,
spoilt little bastard!

19:18.161 --> 19:23.434
You've got no idea what I went
through, the pain that I suffered

19:23.561 --> 19:27.000
and all that time
you were laughing at me, Mimi!

19:27.001 --> 19:29.120
I was screaming for help.

19:29.121 --> 19:31.985
I was begging for somebody
to give me their hand

19:31.986 --> 19:34.185
and all that time
you were laughing at me,

19:34.186 --> 19:38.185
taking the piss
while I was drowning.

19:38.466 --> 19:42.465
I was drowning.

19:46.826 --> 19:50.825
Urgh! Your bollock's out.

19:55.456 --> 19:59.175
It was like the Crying Game
all over again, only in 3D.

19:59.176 --> 20:03.175
Are you two OK now?

20:05.176 --> 20:07.295
If I'd have known.

20:07.296 --> 20:10.175
If we'd have talked,
your burden could've been lighter.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.135
We could've gone on Trisha
or that gobshite on Granada.

20:13.136 --> 20:16.895
Talked things through,
reached an understanding.

20:16.896 --> 20:19.015
A resolution.

20:19.016 --> 20:22.695
But from now on, my casa, su casa.

20:22.696 --> 20:24.175
English, please.

20:24.176 --> 20:26.655
It means her house is my house, love.

20:26.656 --> 20:28.975
As long as you want to stay,
you're welcome.

20:28.976 --> 20:30.295
Such a lot to catch up on.

20:30.296 --> 20:34.295
Come here, love.

20:34.656 --> 20:36.775
And one more thing you need to know.
Jamie and Shane

20:36.776 --> 20:40.215
obviously aren't too comfortable
having me around, so, er...

20:40.216 --> 20:41.495
I might as well say this here.

20:41.496 --> 20:44.575
We had a homo in the footie team
and they were cool with him.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.415
I mean, apart from
touching him during a tackle.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.335
Or bending down for the ball.

20:48.336 --> 20:50.295
Or him kissing them if they scored.

20:50.296 --> 20:52.815
And the showers. And well,
having him on the team but...

20:52.816 --> 20:54.935
Erm...
I've rehearsed this a million times

20:54.936 --> 20:58.575
and I've never got it right, so, er,

20:58.576 --> 21:02.575
forgive my, er, bluntness.
Robert Hepburn's...days

21:04.696 --> 21:08.695
on earth...are numbered.

21:09.056 --> 21:12.375
It's the AIDS, isn't it?
It's God's judgement.

21:12.376 --> 21:15.175
You've been smitten.
I fucking knew it!

21:15.176 --> 21:16.855
Oh, sweet Jesus, I could be next!

21:16.856 --> 21:17.775
Mimi...

21:17.776 --> 21:20.695
I told your dad more than once -
it's not in God's plan.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.535
Mimi, love...

21:22.536 --> 21:24.935
If he'd had meant us
to do it like that

21:24.936 --> 21:28.695
he'd've made it easier
to get it in!

21:28.696 --> 21:32.095
Mimi! It's not
fucking AIDS, OK, it's not AIDS!

21:32.096 --> 21:34.415
I've been living
as a woman for years.

21:34.416 --> 21:35.575
With a woman?

21:35.576 --> 21:39.575
As. Undergoing psychiatric
evaluation, hormone therapy.

21:40.256 --> 21:42.975
And now I'm just waiting
to get the nod.

21:42.976 --> 21:46.975
Come on, I've always said that
me John Thomas gets in the way.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.015
Well, pretty soon it won't.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.655
John Thomas?

21:50.656 --> 21:51.615
Snip!

21:51.616 --> 21:55.615
Ooh!

21:56.816 --> 21:59.695
They're here!
You're fucking kidding!

21:59.696 --> 22:02.815
One word out of place
and I will rip their heads off

22:02.816 --> 22:06.415
and shit down their necks.

22:06.416 --> 22:07.975
All right?

22:07.976 --> 22:08.895
Come in.

22:08.896 --> 22:11.895
You must be Avril.
I hope you like white.

22:11.896 --> 22:14.455
I like most whites.

22:14.456 --> 22:16.535
Thanks for coming, mate.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.695
Our pleasure.

22:17.696 --> 22:21.695
Welcome.

22:21.936 --> 22:22.135
This is Ellen.

22:22.136 --> 22:25.695
Hiya.

22:25.696 --> 22:29.695
Jackson.
Coats.

22:33.496 --> 22:37.495
Go on through.

22:41.536 --> 22:43.695
Two G&T's, please, Micky.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.895
The Scouse transvestite.
Hardly convincing.

22:46.896 --> 22:48.135
Why's that?

22:48.136 --> 22:52.135
The wrong shade of orange
for a start.

22:54.376 --> 22:57.095
Dina wants to audition
for the talent night.

22:57.096 --> 23:00.255
Hardly talent. Even I can do that.

23:00.256 --> 23:04.255
She's got a grip like a python. The
punters call her the penis fly trap.

23:04.336 --> 23:05.935
The things she can't
do with her libia...

23:05.936 --> 23:07.655
Anyone can smoke a cigar.

23:07.656 --> 23:11.655
What...like that?

23:18.176 --> 23:19.175
Admittedly, not.

23:19.176 --> 23:21.255
No, no, but I'm going
to fucking learn one day.

23:21.256 --> 23:24.975
Right, Micky, get her third on the
bill, behind that deaf kid that did

23:24.976 --> 23:27.655
the yodelling, you know...

23:27.656 --> 23:29.455
Audience is going to need
perking up after that, I think.

23:29.456 --> 23:32.495
And, er, me and Bobbi'll be
rehearsing a little special

23:32.496 --> 23:34.175
something too, won't we?

23:34.176 --> 23:38.175
Mm-hm, sister act.

23:40.856 --> 23:44.855
Shane's clamping anything with
wheels. I'm worried for my mobility.

23:47.536 --> 23:49.975
They've only clamped the bloody pram!

23:49.976 --> 23:53.975
Bastards!

23:56.336 --> 23:58.255
My punters are too scared to park.

23:58.256 --> 23:59.975
How are the acts going to get their
gear in here, Micky?

23:59.976 --> 24:03.975
Where are your tutors
expected to park their cars?

24:05.496 --> 24:07.055
What've you done to Shane?

24:07.056 --> 24:08.615
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:08.616 --> 24:10.775
He's not answering his phone.

24:10.776 --> 24:11.815
Well, maybe he's tied up.

24:11.816 --> 24:15.815
You've done something.
Where is he?

24:17.856 --> 24:20.615
Bastaaaard!

24:20.616 --> 24:24.335
Fucking kill you!

24:24.336 --> 24:25.375
Whoa! You said you'd back off!

24:25.376 --> 24:26.175
What is going on?

24:26.176 --> 24:27.935
I'm just showing our Shane
what an inconvenience it is

24:27.936 --> 24:30.535
when you're clamped.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.055
He's not worth it.

24:32.056 --> 24:33.095
Pack it in!

24:33.096 --> 24:35.135
You said you'd walk!

24:35.136 --> 24:37.215
You'd do best to remember
who pays your wages.

24:37.216 --> 24:41.215
Yeah, time for you to
nail your colours, Micky.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.895
He's in on the business.

24:43.896 --> 24:45.575
Silent partner.

24:45.576 --> 24:48.095
You work for me or you work for him.

24:48.096 --> 24:52.095
Not both. It's time to choose.

24:57.216 --> 24:58.655
Smells fantastic,
don't you think, Ellen?

24:58.656 --> 24:59.655
Mmm.

24:59.656 --> 25:01.375
It's an old family recipe.

25:01.376 --> 25:05.375
Braised crocodile cheeks
in an apricot and prickly pear sauce.

25:07.096 --> 25:10.615
It's a delicacy where
my family come from.

25:10.616 --> 25:14.615
Just pulling your leg.
Creole Chicken.

25:16.536 --> 25:17.535
Really nice of you to invite us.

25:17.536 --> 25:19.295
That's entirely down to Jackson.

25:19.296 --> 25:23.295
I wouldn't normally piss on a
member of the BAP if he were on fire.

25:27.816 --> 25:29.855
We've got a bad reputation.

25:29.856 --> 25:31.375
Something we're working on.

25:31.376 --> 25:32.735
How, exactly?

25:32.736 --> 25:34.215
Well, we're opening doors.

25:34.216 --> 25:37.095
If you're British born and bred,
you're welcome.

25:37.096 --> 25:39.975
But we all know that's to fit in
with a legal requirement.

25:39.976 --> 25:43.415
You wouldn't do it
if you didn't have to.

25:43.416 --> 25:47.415
Eat.

25:47.936 --> 25:49.215
Avril's every right
to be suspicious.

25:49.216 --> 25:51.215
Country's gone to the dogs.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.415
Agreed?

25:52.416 --> 25:54.895
We're all getting ready
for that spring, summer,

25:54.896 --> 25:56.575
autumn and winter of discontent.

25:56.576 --> 25:59.855
So your party isn't waging
a war against race any more.

25:59.856 --> 26:02.455
It's a class war now.

26:02.456 --> 26:05.575
The country's being run by a
gang of public schoolboys who don't

26:05.576 --> 26:07.815
know the meaning of doing without.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.815
A millionaire boys' club, who've got
the temerity to tell us to tighten

26:12.416 --> 26:15.095
our belts while they're heading off
to their holiday homes in Barbados.

26:15.096 --> 26:16.455
So it's equality you're after?

26:16.456 --> 26:20.455
We're after British people
being treated fairly. Put first.

26:20.976 --> 26:22.735
We've got a march this Saturday.

26:22.736 --> 26:25.775
Lefties and students are onto it.
Some contacts of the

26:25.776 --> 26:28.095
police have told me they're
going to meet us mob-handed.

26:28.096 --> 26:29.815
You're cancelling, I hope?

26:29.816 --> 26:33.535
We've got a democratic right to our
opinion. The march is going ahead.

26:33.536 --> 26:37.535
They won't be able to chant
their usual racist insults at us.

26:38.256 --> 26:42.255
Not once they've
clocked our poster boy.

26:46.696 --> 26:48.215
You up for it?

26:48.216 --> 26:52.215
Deffo.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.095
You know as well as I do,

26:58.096 --> 27:00.975
that march will turn into a riot-
and you'll be at the front of it.

27:00.976 --> 27:02.415
It won't come to that.

27:02.416 --> 27:05.335
If you're lucky enough not to end up
in the morgue, you'll lose your job.

27:05.336 --> 27:06.655
That won't happen.

27:06.656 --> 27:10.655
Will you take your fucking head
from up your arse

27:10.976 --> 27:14.855
and wake up to what it is you're
getting involved in, Jackson!?

27:14.856 --> 27:18.375
Anyone accuses me of going along
with what that lunatic's preaching

27:18.376 --> 27:20.735
and I remind them
I was the one that leaked this.

27:20.736 --> 27:22.855
What is it?

27:22.856 --> 27:26.855
A list of every BAP member
registered to vote in the UK.

27:27.616 --> 27:31.615
Where d'you get it?

27:41.776 --> 27:45.015
I get this to the papers before the march
and I save a few heads being kicked.

27:45.016 --> 27:46.855
He'll know it's you.

27:46.856 --> 27:49.295
Not me.

27:49.296 --> 27:51.695
I'll ask Chesney to do it.

27:51.696 --> 27:53.255
Stop worrying.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.855
Come here.

27:54.856 --> 27:58.855
I've got it covered.

28:02.696 --> 28:04.495
You nervous, Michael?

28:04.496 --> 28:06.455
You've every fucking right to be.

28:06.456 --> 28:08.575
These are your two choices.

28:08.576 --> 28:10.095
It's all down to you.

28:10.096 --> 28:13.815
And over to the lovely Roberta
for that last-minute reminder.

28:13.816 --> 28:16.775
Thank you. Eh, stop it, cheeky!

28:16.776 --> 28:20.775
OK, choose Jamie and you condemn
Shane and Kelly to a life on the

28:20.896 --> 28:24.895
outside, with absolutely no
back-up whatsoever from any Maguire.

28:25.696 --> 28:29.455
Within weeks they'll be sleeping
rough, forced to sell what little

28:29.456 --> 28:32.535
they do have, in order to survive!

28:32.536 --> 28:34.655
And choice B, please, Roberta.

28:34.656 --> 28:37.215
Ooh, choice B, Shane.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.335
By choosing him, you'll essentially

28:39.336 --> 28:42.615
be dismantling the family business,
which means that you and Shane

28:42.616 --> 28:45.855
will not be able to work for the
family, therefore rendering the family

28:45.856 --> 28:48.455
business, by definition, redundant!

28:48.456 --> 28:50.615
Do remember, though, Michael,
choice B

28:50.616 --> 28:54.615
carries the hidden bonus of a
return for your ma to the Holy Land!

28:58.056 --> 28:59.775
That's right.
Mum will get an all-expenses paid,

28:59.776 --> 29:03.775
one-way trip all the way back
to the banks of the Mersey!

29:04.976 --> 29:07.215
Michael, it's time to...

29:07.216 --> 29:10.255
Make your choice!

29:10.256 --> 29:13.535
Choose! Choose!
Choose! Choose!

29:13.536 --> 29:17.535
Choose! Choose! Choose! Choose!

29:40.416 --> 29:42.015
It's time, Micky.

29:42.016 --> 29:42.655
We need a decision.

29:42.656 --> 29:43.895
Not yet.

29:43.896 --> 29:44.415
Do it now.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.655
I can't!

29:45.656 --> 29:46.535
You're going to have to.

29:46.536 --> 29:47.455
I need more time.

29:47.456 --> 29:48.495
Well, you haven't got it.

29:48.496 --> 29:49.815
But I need an extension.

29:49.816 --> 29:53.375
Look, there's too much to
consider at such short notice.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.255
You know what I'm like.
It takes me half an hour

29:55.256 --> 29:57.495
to decide which side of bed
to get out of in the morning!

29:57.496 --> 30:00.615
There's only one side you
can get out, you daft twat.

30:00.616 --> 30:02.335
Your bed's against a wall.

30:02.336 --> 30:06.335
It was a metaphor!
Cornflakes, Weetabix, Coco Pops.

30:06.456 --> 30:10.455
Black socks, white socks, sports
socks, boxers, Y-fronts, G-string!

30:14.576 --> 30:16.655
There's too many decisions
to make as it is!

30:16.656 --> 30:18.295
Micky, what colour
do you want these?

30:18.296 --> 30:21.895
How the fuck
should I know, you s...!

30:21.896 --> 30:25.895
Sorry, Karen.
Two soft whites, please.

30:30.016 --> 30:32.335
Is it true, then?
You're just waiting for the snip?

30:32.336 --> 30:34.735
Oh, jungle drums
been banging, have they?

30:34.736 --> 30:36.455
What do you do with it
while you're waiting?

30:36.456 --> 30:38.895
I mean, where do you put it?

30:38.896 --> 30:42.015
Well,
let me get the drinks in and then

30:42.016 --> 30:45.175
I'll tell you all you need to know.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.895
Mimi, love, can I get a G&T

30:46.896 --> 30:50.015
and whatever my new
best mates are having?

30:50.016 --> 30:51.895
These are on me, love.

30:51.896 --> 30:55.815
Aw.

30:55.816 --> 30:58.815
You know, I was always the one
with the talent. And the looks.

30:58.816 --> 31:02.775
People used to say to me I was more
of a woman than she could ever be.

31:02.776 --> 31:06.775
They did! No, they did!

31:12.296 --> 31:13.975
Spag bol all right for you, Bobbi?

31:13.976 --> 31:17.375
You know me. Love a bit of spick.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.655
Are my slacks ready yet, Meems?

31:18.656 --> 31:22.655
Oh, upstairs. I'll just give them
a quick once-over with the iron.

31:26.376 --> 31:27.855
You know, we're
not that different, me and you.

31:27.856 --> 31:28.855
No?

31:28.856 --> 31:29.575
No.

31:29.576 --> 31:31.215
You mean apart from you
being a two-faced shit

31:31.216 --> 31:34.615
and slagging off me mam
behind her back?

31:34.616 --> 31:35.615
It's grown teeth.

31:35.616 --> 31:36.775
She's me mam.

31:36.776 --> 31:38.535
She's my sister.

31:38.536 --> 31:39.695
I'll tell her.

31:39.696 --> 31:41.935
No, you won't.
You know as well as I do, if you let

31:41.936 --> 31:44.775
her know that I really think she's a
fat, fucking ugly, embarrassing waste

31:44.776 --> 31:47.135
of space, it'd break her heart.

31:47.136 --> 31:48.095
Don't.

31:48.096 --> 31:51.175
Leaving me alone in Liverpool
was the best favour she ever did.

31:51.176 --> 31:54.975
The only reason I'm here
is cos I've nowhere else to go.

31:54.976 --> 31:58.415
Are you going to
tell her that as well?

31:58.416 --> 32:01.855
No. You haven't got the balls, Micky.

32:01.856 --> 32:05.855
Why don't you wait a few weeks?
You can have mine.

32:06.056 --> 32:06.775
I'll tell her.

32:06.776 --> 32:10.775
Meems! Micky's got
something he'd like to say.

32:11.776 --> 32:13.495
No, I was just saying,

32:13.496 --> 32:15.775
I'm really looking forward to
your duet with Uncle Robert.

32:15.776 --> 32:18.655
Steal the show.

32:18.656 --> 32:19.775
It's Bobbi.

32:19.776 --> 32:23.775
It's fucking Robert.

32:32.681 --> 32:36.680
All right, Frank?

32:39.416 --> 32:43.415
I'm so high, I don't wanna
come down, Jimi.

32:44.096 --> 32:48.095
See you on the flip side.

32:51.096 --> 32:55.095
CROWD CHEER

32:55.216 --> 32:58.455
Wanker.

32:58.456 --> 33:00.455
Was hoping you'd be in.

33:00.456 --> 33:04.455
Get in the car.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.775
Some fucker robbed
the membership list.

33:14.776 --> 33:17.175
We've got a lot of support up on high

33:17.176 --> 33:19.735
but people'll be terrified
to back us if this gets out.

33:19.736 --> 33:23.735
If it gets out?

33:25.616 --> 33:27.975
I always keep this
memory stick on me.

33:27.976 --> 33:31.615
Mate of mine's a journo at
the paper that got contacted.

33:31.616 --> 33:35.455
He dialled 1471, got the number,
we did a bit of research.

33:35.456 --> 33:38.695
Found out who it was.

33:38.696 --> 33:39.975
Go on.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.815
That little Paki bastard you know.
Chesney?

33:42.816 --> 33:46.815
Listen - Ches isn't politically
minded, not in that sense.

33:47.256 --> 33:50.375
He went through my stuff in the
changing rooms while we played footy.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.575
So what will you do,
give him a hiding?

33:52.576 --> 33:54.935
Gonna make an example of him.

33:54.936 --> 33:56.455
What do you mean, an example?

33:56.456 --> 34:00.055
A couple of the lads are on
their way over, tooled up.

34:00.056 --> 34:02.455
We're gonna have a few cocktails.

34:02.456 --> 34:03.495
Cocktails?

34:03.496 --> 34:07.495
Always have a few drinks
at a barbie, don't you?

34:14.656 --> 34:17.335
Mimi, same again.

34:17.335 --> 34:18.375
Yeah, OK.

34:18.376 --> 34:21.935
It can't have been easy
growing up knowing what you knew.

34:21.936 --> 34:24.094
That you were trapped.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.255
I can't imagine what
that must feel like.

34:26.255 --> 34:28.054
I can.

34:28.056 --> 34:29.775
Well, everyone's got their burden.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.094
How come it's taken this long?

34:32.096 --> 34:34.175
Having his cock cut off?

34:34.176 --> 34:37.495
Didn't have the confidence,
or the backing of me family either.

34:37.496 --> 34:41.375
It can't have been easy news for
your mother and father to absorb.

34:41.376 --> 34:45.215
When Rodney said he was a philatelist,
I couldn't get out of bed for a month.

34:45.216 --> 34:48.014
You expect that from the older
generation. But the one place

34:48.016 --> 34:52.014
I expected just a little bit of
support was from my own sister.

34:52.216 --> 34:53.815
And it never came.

34:53.815 --> 34:57.815
I tried to end it all a few times.

34:58.416 --> 35:02.415
A scream for help
that was never answered.

35:02.616 --> 35:05.455
Abandoned at 16, mam and dad dead.

35:05.456 --> 35:08.215
With the burden
of a penis you never wanted.

35:08.216 --> 35:09.975
When I had my appendix out,

35:09.976 --> 35:12.135
they gave me it in a jar.
Are you thinking...

35:12.136 --> 35:13.175
No.

35:13.176 --> 35:17.175
Here you go, girls.
Run off my feet here.

35:19.696 --> 35:20.415
Everything all right?

35:20.416 --> 35:24.415
Fine.

35:30.176 --> 35:32.655
We need to get some bread rolls,

35:32.656 --> 35:34.375
mayo, cans of tuna, cans of ham.

35:34.376 --> 35:36.975
We can rustle up a
decent buffet between us.

35:36.976 --> 35:39.735
When the going gets tough,
the tough go shopping.

35:39.736 --> 35:42.495
I'll get a few bob out of petty cash.
Will you go for it?

35:42.496 --> 35:44.855
What, in these heels?

35:44.856 --> 35:47.615
Well, I'd rather have ham.

35:47.616 --> 35:50.055
I'll put cheese on a bit...

35:50.056 --> 35:52.055
Bastards!

35:52.056 --> 35:53.535
Come here!

35:53.536 --> 35:54.895
I know your dad!

35:54.896 --> 35:58.895
Yeah?
Well, I fuckin' don't! Dickhead.

35:58.976 --> 36:02.975
Least we know he's in.
Soon as the lads arrive, we're on.

36:03.656 --> 36:06.975
Time for you to prove yourself.
We're shaping history, Jackson.

36:06.976 --> 36:10.975
You should be proud.

36:13.096 --> 36:16.375
It'll be fine, son, the show.
It's gonna be great, I can feel it.

36:16.376 --> 36:17.455
You reckon?

36:17.456 --> 36:20.535
The whole estate's buzzing.
Gonna be one to remember.

36:20.536 --> 36:22.175
Proud of you.

36:22.176 --> 36:23.775
Yeah?

36:23.776 --> 36:26.575
Well, not everyone could
organise a night like this.

36:26.576 --> 36:28.815
Takes a lot of dedication and skill.

36:28.816 --> 36:31.255
And don't forget,
there's a little of Bobbi's

36:31.256 --> 36:35.255
DNA running through them veins.

36:37.176 --> 36:39.175
Decision time.

36:39.176 --> 36:40.655
Time to make your choice, Micky.

36:40.656 --> 36:43.255
I can't, I need a slash!

36:43.256 --> 36:46.815
Fuck's sake. Straight in, straight
out. We've got plans to make.

36:46.816 --> 36:50.815
We've got plans to make.

37:12.496 --> 37:13.815
'We need some bread rolls.'

37:13.816 --> 37:15.175
'Will you go for it?'

37:15.176 --> 37:19.175
'What, in these heels?'

37:24.256 --> 37:28.255
You can work this to your advantage,
soft arse.

37:28.256 --> 37:30.895
All you've ever done
is give to those bastards

37:30.896 --> 37:34.735
and what have they given you in
return? Their respect? Their love?

37:34.736 --> 37:36.975
Fuck off, they love me.

37:36.976 --> 37:39.375
They've got a fucked-up way
of showing it.

37:39.376 --> 37:43.375
But it's hardly surprising
with the parenting that you've had.

37:44.976 --> 37:48.295
50-50.

37:49.149 --> 37:51.770
Come on.
Come away with me.

37:52.165 --> 37:56.689
Sun all year round, sandy beaches
and all the cock you could handle.

37:57.165 --> 38:01.164
Come on.

38:04.485 --> 38:06.044
Jamie! Shane!

38:06.045 --> 38:10.044
They're gonna shit on you for the
rest of your life if you let them.

38:18.498 --> 38:22.497
Bang on time.

38:30.418 --> 38:34.417
You know the drill, boys.

38:37.142 --> 38:41.141
Soon as it's alight, chuck the can
into the flames and walk.

38:43.942 --> 38:45.941
No.

38:45.942 --> 38:47.401
Everything I've worked for,

38:47.402 --> 38:50.006
everything I've built up
over the past ten years has been

38:50.007 --> 38:52.966
fucked over by that little
bastard, and he's gonna pay.

38:53.740 --> 38:57.739
Get your fucking bala on.

39:08.540 --> 39:12.219
Mark, Mark, Mark, please!
I'll do anything.

39:12.220 --> 39:16.219
Stand up for your rights, Jackson.
That's all I'm asking you to do!

39:16.220 --> 39:19.779
Get out! Everyone out! Get out!

39:19.780 --> 39:22.259
What's going on?

39:22.260 --> 39:25.779
Fuck!

39:25.780 --> 39:29.779
Piss off, love.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.579
I've got your back, Jimi!

39:40.580 --> 39:44.579
Cheers, Frank.

39:47.660 --> 39:51.659
Bastard!

40:03.740 --> 40:07.539
It was me who copied your membership
list. If I see you again,

40:07.540 --> 40:11.379
or have any trouble from you, it'll
find its way to the national press.

40:11.380 --> 40:15.379
You got that? Good.

40:20.180 --> 40:24.179
And this is for Ches.

40:32.340 --> 40:36.099
You robbed the takings
from your own sister?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.659
Oh, what can I say? I'm sorry.

40:38.660 --> 40:41.299
I'm still trying to
get my head round this.

40:41.300 --> 40:45.299
From your own flesh and blood?

40:45.500 --> 40:49.179
Oh, cut the bullshit, please,
will ya, girl? Flesh and blood?

40:49.180 --> 40:52.059
We never even
fucking liked each other.

40:52.060 --> 40:54.659
We misunderstood each other.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.459
We were young, immature.

40:56.460 --> 40:58.539
Mimi, can I just set
the record straight here?

40:58.540 --> 41:01.979
You've said often enough I was
never the brother that you wanted.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.579
Well, here's the funny thing,

41:03.580 --> 41:06.619
you were never the
fucking sister I wanted.

41:06.620 --> 41:08.339
Watch your fucking mouth.

41:08.340 --> 41:11.459
Think I'm frightened of you?
You think cos I dress like this,

41:11.460 --> 41:14.139
I can't handle myself?
Back the fuck off, pretty boy.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.899
Leave it, Jamie.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.379
Your ma said she used
to be embarrassed of me.

41:20.380 --> 41:24.379
Well, it was nothing to what I felt when
I'd see her waddling down the street

41:24.500 --> 41:28.499
with her fucking bubble perm
and her fucking shellsuits.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.379
More of a woman than
you'll ever be, though.

41:31.380 --> 41:34.219
That's debatable.

41:34.220 --> 41:37.139
There wasn't one ounce of femininity
about you

41:37.140 --> 41:39.259
when we were being dragged up.

41:39.260 --> 41:43.059
When I got up in the morning,
it was to get the house ready

41:43.060 --> 41:45.499
and you to school.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.779
Then I nursed my ma till she died,

41:47.780 --> 41:50.459
then I helped my dad
deal with the grief.

41:50.460 --> 41:54.459
When was I supposed to find time
to paint my nails and do my hair?

41:54.580 --> 41:58.539
Oh, the trials of St Mimi. Be careful, 
the stigmata will start playing up.

41:58.540 --> 41:59.579
Watch your mouth!

41:59.580 --> 42:03.579
If you want fucking knocking out by
a pre-op, Shane, you just go for it.

42:04.060 --> 42:08.059
Leave us, the three of ya.

42:20.740 --> 42:24.739
What will it cost to go from pole
to hole?

42:25.300 --> 42:27.299
You mean to complete my dream?

42:27.300 --> 42:30.139
Give me the life I should
have had, but never did?

42:30.140 --> 42:34.139
Give me the start I should have had?

42:38.260 --> 42:42.259
Priceless.

42:48.780 --> 42:52.779
Bye, Bobbi.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.259
You let Bobbi go?

43:05.260 --> 43:08.419
With the cash? Why?

43:08.420 --> 43:10.419
Cos he's my brother.

43:10.420 --> 43:14.379
Sort of.
And that's what you do.

43:14.380 --> 43:17.659
And any more talk of choosing sides,

43:17.660 --> 43:20.899
and Bobbi won't be the only
one getting his cock cut off.

43:20.900 --> 43:24.899
Comprende?

43:26.580 --> 43:28.059
She might have a point.

43:28.060 --> 43:32.059
Yeah. But you're fucking barred.

43:43.580 --> 43:47.059
Listen, listen. Right, if anything
goes wrong, improvise, yeah?

43:47.060 --> 43:50.179
The audience won't give a fuck,
they'll be pissed anyway.

43:50.180 --> 43:54.179
Let's get that royal
seal of approval!

43:55.020 --> 43:57.219
And remember, there's no "I"
in showbiz.

43:57.220 --> 44:00.499
Yeah, there is.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.179
Ready?

44:02.180 --> 44:06.179
Go break your legs!

44:34.500 --> 44:38.499
Someone get that pin
off her, for fuck's sake.
