WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.511
TEACHERS MARRY STUDENTS.
THERE'S NO BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.414
WHAT'S THE-- I MEAN,
IS IT REALLY WRONG?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.883
OKAY, LET'S SAY
I STOPPED LAURA'S THERAPY.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.385
SURELY IN A YEAR,
18 MONTHS...

00:17.485 --> 00:18.986
- NO, PAUL.
- ...WHEN IT'S COOLED OFF--

00:19.087 --> 00:20.688
THERE'S NO COOLING-OFF PERIOD.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.023
BUT THAT'S
JUST SOME BULLSHIT
SOME LAWYER CAME UP WITH.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.858
NO, IT'S NOT A LAW.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.260
IT'S BEYOND
A CODE OF ETHICS.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.596
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU CARRY INSIDE YOU.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.864
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO WOULD DISAGREE WITH THIS.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.733
THEN GO TO THEM.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.370
IT'S REALLY TOUGH WHEN
I'M ALONE WITH HER, YOU KNOW,

00:36.470 --> 00:40.208
AND SHE'S ASKING ME,
"PLEASE, JUST BE HONEST.

00:40.308 --> 00:43.477
PLEASE, TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL,"

00:44.712 --> 00:46.480
AND I CAN'T.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.718
PAUL, YOU NEED TO SAY IT.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.586
I LOVE HER.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.483
( theme music playing )

01:43.937 --> 01:45.005
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.275
COME IN, COME IN.

01:49.076 --> 01:49.977
HI, GINA.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.712
- KATE, HELLO.
- HI.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.783
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- AND YOU.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.519
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
BEFORE, RIGHT?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.388
IT WAS YEARS AGO.

02:00.488 --> 02:03.924
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
THE ARGENTINEANS, I THINK.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.427
OH, AN INSTITUTE CONFERENCE.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.497
YES, THAT'S RIGHT,
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.098
YOU LOOK GREAT.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.833
THANK YOU.
SO DO YOU.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.835
OH, WELL...

02:17.371 --> 02:18.839
THIS ROOM'S LOVELY.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.308
THANK YOU.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.109
I DID SOME REARRANGING,
BUT I'M NOT SURE

02:22.210 --> 02:23.744
HOW COMFORTABLE
I AM IN IT.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.248
I TOLD MYSELF I WOULD
WRITE A FEW HOURS A DAY.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.417
DID PAUL
TELL YOU I RETIRED?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.985
UH, NO.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.556
NO, PAUL DIDN'T TELL ME.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.927
- WRITING--
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- WE'LL SEE.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.695
( chuckles )

02:41.795 --> 02:43.931
YEAH, I MEAN,
I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT
THAT I MIGHT TRY MY HAND,

02:44.031 --> 02:47.635
BUT I WOULDN'T
EVER DARE.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.442
SO, UM...

02:54.542 --> 02:57.511
IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL
TO HAVE ONGOING SESSIONS

02:57.611 --> 02:59.547
WITH PAUL AND THEN
TO SEE THE BOTH OF YOU.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.115
I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL
IF WE ALL DECIDED

03:02.216 --> 03:03.551
HOW TO APPROACH THIS.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.119
I THINK I TOLD YOU
WHEN I CALLED

03:06.220 --> 03:08.256
THAT THIS WAS
KATE'S SUGGESTION.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.324
YOU SAID THAT.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.960
IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
I'D AGREE TO IT.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.628
WHY NOT?

03:14.728 --> 03:17.898
WELL, WE'VE BLURRED
SOME LINES HERE,
YOU AND I.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.668
THAT'S TRUE,
WE HAVE.

03:20.768 --> 03:24.472
BUT I THINK WE'LL BE
OKAY IF WE SET DOWN
SOME GUIDELINES.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.241
I WAS THINKING
WE COULD MEET THREE TIMES,

03:27.341 --> 03:28.909
RE-EVALUATE
AND THEN DECIDE

03:29.009 --> 03:31.679
WHERE WE WANT
TO GO FROM THERE.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.381
OKAY?

03:33.481 --> 03:37.117
- YEAH, OKAY.
- OKAY.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.888
NOW WHAT MADE YOU
DECIDE TO COME HERE?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.495
PAUL, YOU SAID THAT
IT WAS KATE'S SUGGESTION,

03:47.595 --> 03:50.364
BUT YOU'RE GOING
ALONG WITH IT.

03:50.464 --> 03:54.234
I THINK I TOLD YOU
ABOUT KATE GOING TO ROME...

03:54.335 --> 03:57.070
AND WHO SHE WENT WITH.

03:57.170 --> 04:01.241
SHE GOT BACK AND, UH...

04:01.342 --> 04:03.311
SHE SAID THAT IT WAS
OVER WITH THAT GUY

04:03.411 --> 04:07.348
AND I GUESS WE BOTH HAD

04:07.448 --> 04:09.550
THE SENSE OF
"SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?"

04:09.650 --> 04:13.086
KATE DID OFFER TO TALK
ABOUT IT AND I COULDN'T.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.123
I WAS TOO ANGRY.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.191
I KNOW
IN COUPLES THERAPY

04:18.292 --> 04:20.428
YOU TRY NOT
TO BLAME EACH OTHER

04:20.528 --> 04:22.330
AND I'M ALWAYS TELLING
MY PATIENTS THAT,

04:22.430 --> 04:24.164
YOU KNOW, LIKE IT'S
THE SIMPLEST THING.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.700
NOW HERE I AM
AND, UH...

04:28.569 --> 04:31.138
I CAN'T STOP BLAMING.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.642
INTELLECTUALLY,
I GET IT, THAT I'M HALF
OF THE EQUATION, BUT...

04:36.377 --> 04:37.911
YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T
TALK TO KATE,

04:38.011 --> 04:41.315
SO SHE HASN'T HEARD
ANY OF THIS, HOW YOU FEEL.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.952
WELL, I THINK SHE KNOWS
THAT SHE HURT ME...

04:45.052 --> 04:46.954
DEEPLY...

04:47.054 --> 04:48.822
AND THAT, UH...

04:48.922 --> 04:50.591
THAT I HATED HER.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.529
COULD YOU GO INTO THAT?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.632
I HATED YOU FOR THINKING
YOU WERE ENTITLED
TO THIS SOMEHOW,

04:58.732 --> 05:00.901
THAT YOU IMPLIED THAT
I BROUGHT IT ON MYSELF.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.336
I COULDN'T SHAKE IT.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.939
EVERY MINUTE, I'D GET
A WAVE OF RAGE AND LOSS.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.008
WHY? WHY LOSS?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.778
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN FORGIVE HER.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.080
I'VE SEEN COUPLES
COME BACK FROM THIS,

05:13.180 --> 05:16.617
BUT, RIGHT NOW,
I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I KNOW HOW THEY DID IT.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.486
ANYWAY,
SHE GOT BACK TUESDAY

05:18.586 --> 05:21.555
AND I SAID, "WELL,
SHOULD I MOVE OUT?"

05:21.655 --> 05:25.058
SHE SAID THAT WASN'T
WHAT SHE WANTED AND...

05:30.764 --> 05:32.466
YOU TELL HER.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.771
WELL, I JUST ASKED HIM
WHY HE COULDN'T TALK TO ME

05:37.871 --> 05:39.507
ABOUT ALL OF THIS,
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

05:39.607 --> 05:41.875
EVERYTHING
WE'RE GOING THROUGH.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.577
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT, PAUL?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.313
I JUST SAID
I COULDN'T.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.583
I TELL PATIENTS THAT
HAVING SOMEONE CHEAT ON YOU

05:49.683 --> 05:51.218
IS LIKE MOURNING
A DEATH.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.287
WHO YOU WERE AS A COUPLE,
THE IMAGE THAT YOU
HAVE OF YOURSELF--

05:54.388 --> 05:58.225
IT IS LIKE
LOSING A LOVED ONE.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.161
YOU KEEP TELLING US

06:01.261 --> 06:03.564
WHAT YOU TELL PATIENTS,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.467
BUT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOURNING,

06:06.567 --> 06:09.302
YOUR RAGE,
YOUR LOSS.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.304
YOU'RE SOUNDING
VERY CONTROLLED.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.373
WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO THROW SOMETHING?

06:13.474 --> 06:15.643
TRY TO STRANGLE HER?
( chuckles )

06:19.312 --> 06:20.914
I CAN BARELY LOOK AT HER.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.750
I'M SO...

06:24.752 --> 06:28.656
I FEEL LIKE
I'M FALLING APART, GINA.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.059
I SHOULD TELL YOU THIS,
AND KATE ALREADY KNOWS--

06:32.159 --> 06:33.827
I, UH...

06:36.597 --> 06:39.132
I ATTACKED
A PATIENT IN THERAPY.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.036
THE PILOT.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.405
IN THE MIDDLE OF THERAPY,
I JUMPED HIM. I LOST IT.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.340
SUDDENLY, I WAS ON TOP
OF HIM. I GRABBED HIM.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.910
I ALMOST--

06:50.010 --> 06:53.581
I ALMOST HIT HIM.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.617
SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.319
OR BOTH OF US,
I GUESS.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.288
ANYWAY, MY FIRST THOUGHT
AFTERWARDS WAS THAT

07:01.388 --> 07:05.493
I WAS REACTING
TO KATE.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.562
SHE CAME HOME

07:08.662 --> 07:10.297
DURING THE SESSION,
SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR,

07:10.397 --> 07:14.367
BACK FROM ROME.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.937
I HEARD HER OUTSIDE
THE OFFICE AND THEN...

07:21.241 --> 07:22.843
WHAT IS IT?

07:24.011 --> 07:27.915
I SHOULDN'T DISCUSS
A PATIENT WITH KATE HERE.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.754
YOU CAN'T DISCUSS A PATIENT
WHO'S SPYING ON ME?

07:35.556 --> 07:39.159
HE DID ALL THIS RESEARCH

07:39.259 --> 07:41.328
ABOUT KATE AND ABOUT--

07:41.428 --> 07:43.030
ABOUT MY FATHER.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.933
HE KNEW THAT KATE
WAS IN ITALY WITH, UH...

07:47.300 --> 07:49.703
WITH ANOTHER MAN AND HE--

07:49.803 --> 07:51.772
HE THREW IT
IN MY FACE.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.041
- HOW DID HE KNOW THAT?
- Paul: HE MADE CALLS.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.343
PEOPLE THAT HAD
RECOMMENDED ME TO HIM.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.345
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.514
ANYWAY,
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.817
INSTEAD OF
HANDLING IT PROPERLY,
I JUMPED IN AND...

08:07.521 --> 08:08.989
I LAY IN BED
THAT NIGHT THINKING,

08:09.089 --> 08:11.424
"DO I TAKE A MONTH OFF?
DO I TAKE THREE MONTHS OFF?

08:11.525 --> 08:13.360
MAYBE I SHOULD
TAKE A YEAR OFF.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.597
MAYBE I'M--
MAYBE I'M--

08:16.697 --> 08:18.799
MAYBE I'M ALL DONE."

08:20.033 --> 08:22.736
- AND THAT'S MY FAULT?
- WHAT?

08:22.836 --> 08:26.439
YOUR CREEPY PATIENT,
HE'S MY FAULT AS WELL?

08:26.540 --> 08:29.777
ACTUALLY, IT MADE ME THINK
HOW MUCH I NEED YOU.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.214
- DO YOU?
- YEAH, YOU, THE KIDS,

08:34.314 --> 08:35.616
THE HOUSE--
I NEED THAT.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.517
I NEED THAT OTHER PLACE
WHERE I CAN--

08:37.618 --> 08:39.086
THAT-- WHAT?
HANG ON.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.789
THAT OTHER PLACE?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.157
OH, PAUL,

08:44.257 --> 08:48.128
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE PLACE.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.803
I'M SORRY.
HOW DOES THIS WORK?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.037
DO WE TAKE TURNS?
IS THAT HOW--

08:57.137 --> 08:59.873
SURE, WHATEVER
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.847
LOOK, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME,

09:06.947 --> 09:10.618
TRYING TO DESCRIBE
WHAT I'M FEELING.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.025
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING
A BABY-- YEAH?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.160
--YOU'RE LYING THERE

09:21.161 --> 09:22.896
IN THAT HOSPITAL BED...

09:24.531 --> 09:26.233
AND YOU DON'T NEED--
YOU DON'T WANT

09:26.333 --> 09:28.035
EVERYTHING UNDERSTOOD

09:28.135 --> 09:31.805
AND SHARED
AND ANALYZED
AND DISCUSSED.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.645
ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE

09:37.745 --> 09:40.247
AND THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S
HAND IS RIGHT THERE.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.686
BUT TRY DESCRIBING
TO YOUR HUSBAND

09:45.786 --> 09:48.255
EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO HAVE A CHILD,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.457
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.525
A FRIEND OF MINE
ONCE SAID,

09:52.626 --> 09:55.228
"TAKE AN UMBRELLA,
SHOVE IT UP HIS ASS,

09:55.328 --> 09:56.596
OPEN IT AND PULL.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.633
THEN HE'LL KNOW."

09:59.733 --> 10:02.369
SO SOMEONE STICKING
AN UMBRELLA UP YOUR ASS IS--

10:02.469 --> 10:05.172
WHAT'S THE UMBRELLA?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.440
PLEASE DON'T ANALYZE ME.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.178
WELL, IT'S QUITE
AN ANALOGY.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.080
I'M NOT YOUR PATIENT.

10:13.180 --> 10:17.685
HE DOESN'T GET TO
INTERPRET EVERYTHING
I SAY IN HERE, DOES HE?

10:17.785 --> 10:19.720
IT'S THE SAME HERE
AS WHEN PAUL'S AT HOME.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.822
HE'S NOT
A PSYCHOTHERAPIST HERE.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.959
HE'S A MAN
DEALING WITH A CRISIS
IN HIS MARRIAGE.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.929
HE'S NOT
A THERAPIST AT HOME?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.698
OKAY.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.773
Gina:
CAN YOU GO ON, KATE?

10:39.873 --> 10:43.744
WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
ATTACKING YOUR PATIENT

10:43.844 --> 10:47.414
I FELT LIKE THAT WAS
FOR MY BENEFIT,

10:47.514 --> 10:49.549
THAT YOU JUST WANTED
TO SHOW ME

10:49.649 --> 10:51.584
WHAT I'D DONE TO YOU
BY SEEING EDWARD

10:51.685 --> 10:54.254
AND HOW I'D
RUINED YOUR LIFE

10:54.354 --> 10:56.256
AND, WELL, YOUR WORK.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.792
YOU HAVEN'T RUINED MY LIFE.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.763
YOU'RE THE BEST
THING IN IT.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.833
WELL, I FELT LIKE YOU WERE
PUTTING ON A SHOW.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.703
CHRIST.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.041
Kate:
YOU KNOW,
I BELIEVED YOU

11:14.141 --> 11:15.876
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU WANTED ME

11:15.976 --> 11:18.946
TO STOP SEEING EDWARD.
I DID.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.114
BUT WHEN YOU SIT HERE
RIGHT NOW AND YOU TELL ME

11:21.214 --> 11:23.083
THAT I'M THE BEST THING
IN YOUR LIFE...

11:24.852 --> 11:26.820
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.192
AND THAT MAKES ME SO SAD.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.698
AND THE WAY YOU TALK
TO ME SOMETIMES,

11:38.799 --> 11:40.267
I MEAN, I WILL
ASK YOU OUTRIGHT,

11:40.367 --> 11:41.769
"DO YOU LOVE ME?"

11:41.869 --> 11:44.237
AND YOU'VE SAID TO ME--

11:44.337 --> 11:46.473
YOU'VE LOOKED AT ME
AND YOU'VE SAID,

11:46.573 --> 11:48.809
"YES... FOR NOW."

11:48.909 --> 11:50.944
IT'S-- THA--
IT'S A JOKE.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.815
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF A JOKE IS THAT?

11:54.915 --> 11:57.284
SOMEONE ASKS YOU
IF YOU LOVE THEM,

11:57.384 --> 12:00.520
YOU DON'T THINK THAT
THEY'RE FEELING VULNERABLE?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.022
A LITTLE INSECURE, MAYBE?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.891
THEY NEED
SOME REASSURANCE?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.959
EVERYTHING WE SAY
HAS MEANING.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.795
- THAT'S YOUR LINE.
- BUT WE DON'T MEAN

12:07.895 --> 12:10.063
- EVERYTHING THAT WE SAY.
- WELL, WHICH IS IT?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.265
I MEAN,
THAT'S PRETTY CONVENIENT
FOR YOU, ISN'T IT?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.668
WE DON'T MEAN
WHAT WE SAY, FINE,

12:15.769 --> 12:18.338
'CAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
A LOT OF WHAT YOU SAY.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.976
I MEAN, GINA JUST
POINTED IT OUT.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.212
YOU SAID, "I'M HURT,"
BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE

12:25.312 --> 12:29.082
YOU WERE READING SOMETHING
OUT OF A PSYCHOLOGY BOOK.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.752
HOW DO YOU NEED ME?
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.922
I JUST DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.528
YOU KNOW, WHEN PAUL
AND I WERE FIRST SEEING
EACH OTHER...

12:44.731 --> 12:47.968
I COULDN'T GET OVER
HOW SERIOUSLY HE TOOK ME.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.339
I'D NEVER HAD THAT
FROM ANYONE.

12:54.407 --> 12:58.245
UP UNTIL THEN, I'D ALWAYS
PRETTY MUCH FELT...

12:58.345 --> 12:59.913
INVISIBLE.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.884
AND THERE WAS ALSO--
THERE WAS THIS--

13:03.984 --> 13:06.887
THIS EXCITING NEW IDEA

13:06.987 --> 13:10.457
THAT UNDER
EVERYTHING PEOPLE SAY

13:10.557 --> 13:11.859
THERE'S ANOTHER INTENTION

13:11.959 --> 13:13.526
AND THAT THERE'S
THIS HIDDEN MEANING,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.997
WHICH JUST MEANT
THAT EVERYTHING
HAD TO BE ANALYZED.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.467
SO, EVERYTHING I SAID
TOOK ON THIS IMPORTANCE

13:20.567 --> 13:23.036
BECAUSE HE WAS WORKING
SO HARD TO FIGURE ME OUT.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.509
AND HE WAS REALLY
THE FIRST PERSON

13:29.609 --> 13:31.644
WHO TRIED
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.080
AND I...

13:41.421 --> 13:42.990
THANK YOU.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.062
...AND I JUST
REMEMBER FEELING...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.531
VERY GRATEFUL
TO HIM FOR THAT.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.768
SO IT WAS QUITE
A SHOCK FOR ME

13:55.869 --> 13:58.405
TO REALIZE THAT
IT WASN'T ABOUT ME.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.209
IT HAD FUCK ALL
TO DO WITH ME, REALLY.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.046
I MEAN,
IT WAS ABOUT HIM.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.949
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ME.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.717
UNDERSTANDING ME,
IT'S NOT ABOUT SUBTEXT.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.619
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE SUBCONSCIOUS.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.655
IT'S NOT ABOUT
READING SOME KIND
OF AN X-RAY, YOU KNOW?

14:15.755 --> 14:18.358
IT'S JUST SO CLINICAL.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.963
ACTUALLY, IT'S WORSE
BECAUSE YOU USE IT
AGAINST ME.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.464
YOU THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

14:24.564 --> 14:26.233
BEFORE I'VE DECIDED
I KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

14:26.333 --> 14:28.035
AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO ARGUE WITH THAT?

14:28.135 --> 14:30.637
THIS IS WHAT I'VE GOTTEN
OUT OF OUR MARRIAGE.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.940
I'VE GOTTA GO OVER EVERYTHING
10 DIFFERENT WAYS IN MY HEAD.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.442
I CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING
AT FACE VALUE.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.577
NOTHING IS SIMPLE.
NOTHING IS EVER SIMPLE.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.213
I HATE IT.
I HATE THAT THAT'S
WHAT I'VE BECOME--

14:42.549 --> 14:45.118
JUST THE PATIENT
MARRIED TO THE DOCTOR.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.756
WELL, FOR SOMEONE
WHO IS ASKING

14:49.856 --> 14:53.026
HOW THIS WHOLE THING WORKS,

14:53.126 --> 14:54.594
YOU'RE DOING
A BLUE-RIBBON JOB.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.563
I GOTTA GIVE YOU THAT.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.469
I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR YOU
TO GRADE MY PERFORMANCE.

15:04.671 --> 15:09.276
KATE, CAN YOU EXPLAIN
TO PAUL WHY YOU WERE
SEEING EDWARD?

15:10.810 --> 15:12.345
I DON'T WANT
TO EXPLAIN.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.214
NO?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.216
NO, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.918
WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.220
SOMETIMES
I JUST DON'T KNOW

15:20.320 --> 15:22.489
AND SOMETIMES
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.863
FINE. INITIALLY,

15:30.964 --> 15:34.234
IT WAS JUST EXCITEMENT
AND ADRENALINE.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.172
AND THERE WAS
THIS POSSIBILITY

15:39.272 --> 15:41.708
WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE MORNING
THAT I MAY DO SOMETHING

15:41.808 --> 15:43.143
THAT I HADN'T PLANNED

15:43.243 --> 15:45.645
OR THAT I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I WAS CAPABLE OF.

15:45.745 --> 15:49.349
AND THAT'S WHO I WAS
BEFORE I MET PAUL.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.084
AND, SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE WAY,

15:51.184 --> 15:53.753
THAT PART OF ME
JUST DIED

15:53.853 --> 15:55.989
OR-- I DON'T KNOW--
IT WAS SMOTHERED.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.393
THE POINT
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS

16:00.493 --> 16:03.096
WHY CAN I NOT
JUST TRUST MYSELF

16:03.196 --> 16:06.966
TO BE WHO I AM
AND TO JUST GET ON WITH IT?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.636
WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU DON'T LOOK,

16:09.736 --> 16:13.373
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERNEATH.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.742
WELL, THAT'S VERY
PROFOUND, I'M SURE.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.010
THERE'S STILL
A REASON WHY YOU--

16:17.110 --> 16:19.112
WOULD YOU
PLEASE STOP IT?

16:19.212 --> 16:21.648
I DO NOT WANT YOUR
INTELLECTUAL INTERPRETATION

16:21.748 --> 16:23.283
OF EVERYTHING I SAY.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.592
I DID IT BECAUSE
I FELT SOMETHING.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.396
WHAT DID YOU FEEL?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.433
WANTED.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.407
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY THAT I WANT YOU?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.542
I DO. I WANT YOU.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

16:49.642 --> 16:52.245
SO THAT
YOU'LL BELIEVE IT.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.215
PAUL, DO YOU FEEL
THAT YOU NEED A WITNESS

16:55.315 --> 16:57.884
TO VERIFY
YOUR LOVE FOR KATE?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.852
THANK YOU.

16:59.952 --> 17:03.223
THANK YOU. I'M SORRY,
BUT I JUST KEEP
GETTING THIS...

17:04.824 --> 17:07.594
THAT IMAGE OF BILL CLINTON,
THAT FOOTAGE OF HIM.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.562
HE WAS STANDING IN FRONT
OF ALL THOSE CAMERAS

17:09.662 --> 17:12.199
AND HE'S WAGGING HIS FINGER
SO ADAMANTLY, YOU KNOW.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.801
"I DID NOT HAVE
SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH THAT WOMAN."

17:14.901 --> 17:17.270
JEEZ,
THAT'S SOME COMPARISON.

17:20.573 --> 17:24.511
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T ASSERT
ANYTHING STRONGLY ENOUGH,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.813
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE
A CLEAR INDICATION

17:26.913 --> 17:28.948
OF MY... INSINCERITY

17:29.048 --> 17:31.218
BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND,

17:31.318 --> 17:33.453
IF I DON'T STATE MY FEELINGS,
THEN THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

17:33.553 --> 17:38.258
FAIR ENOUGH.
MAYBE THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN SAY TO ME.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.960
ALL I KNOW IS
I HAVE TO FEEL IT
IN MY GUT TO BELIEVE IT.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.730
- AND YOU DON'T.
- NO, I DON'T.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.502
DO YOU REMEMBER?

17:49.602 --> 17:52.205
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE TO BE WANTED?

17:52.305 --> 17:55.375
TO BE TRULY DESIRED
AND PURSUED?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.577
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU EXPERIENCE AS A DEBATE.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.213
IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT
YOU NEED TO BE CONVINCED OF.

18:00.313 --> 18:04.251
IT'S JUST THIS--
THIS-- THIS FORCE

18:04.351 --> 18:08.521
THAT HAS TO BE--
THAT HAS TO BE
RECKONED WITH.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.360
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
DID I...

18:14.861 --> 18:16.529
WHAT?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.539
WHAT DID I SAY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:33.313 --> 18:36.783
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
TRANSFERENCE IS?

18:38.585 --> 18:41.621
WHEN A PATIENT HAS
FEELINGS FOR THEIR THERAPIST

18:41.721 --> 18:44.991
WHICH ARE, IN FACT,
DRAWN FROM THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS

18:45.091 --> 18:47.327
WITH THEIR PARENTS.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.863
THEY PROJECT QUALITIES
ONTO THE THERAPIST

18:50.963 --> 18:52.064
THAT DON'T REALLY EXIST

18:52.165 --> 18:55.535
OR THEY CAN BE
JUST EXAGGERATED.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.273
AND THEN WHEN THEY FIND
THE COURAGE, THE PATIENT--

19:00.373 --> 19:02.475
WELL, THEY REACH
A LEVEL OF TRUST

19:02.575 --> 19:06.078
AND THEY FEEL
SAFE ENOUGH TO EXPRESS
THEIR DESIRE FOR THE...

19:06.179 --> 19:09.782
AND SO FOR A TIME,

19:11.184 --> 19:13.420
THE PATIENT MAY
EXPERIENCE FEELINGS

19:13.520 --> 19:15.054
AS IF THEY'RE
TRULY INTENDED

19:15.154 --> 19:18.491
FOR THE THERAPIST.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.269
DID YOU FUCK HER?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.405
WHAT?

19:33.773 --> 19:35.775
WELL, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME? I'M NOT SURE.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.445
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT
YOU SLEPT WITH A PATIENT?

19:38.545 --> 19:41.648
Paul:
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M...

19:41.748 --> 19:45.285
YOU ASKED ME IF I FELT
SOMEONE'S DESIRE FOR ME.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.087
AND I'M SAYING YES.
I HAVE PATIENTS
WHO'VE INDICATED

19:48.187 --> 19:52.091
FEELINGS FOR ME,
ONLY I'M NOT FLYING OFF
TO ROME TO FUCK THEM.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.961
IT HAPPENS IN THERAPY
ALL THE TIME.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.368
HAS THIS
HAPPENED TO YOU?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.672
Paul:
I'VE SPOKEN
TO GINA ABOUT IT.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.275
IT'S REALLY VALUABLE
FOR ME TO EXPLORE
MY OWN FEELINGS

20:08.375 --> 20:10.277
WITH ANOTHER THERAPIST,

20:10.377 --> 20:11.644
SO THAT THEY DON'T
GET IN THE WAY,

20:11.744 --> 20:13.646
SO THAT I CAN WORK
THROUGH MY FEELINGS

20:13.746 --> 20:17.484
BECAUSE THEN I DON'T LET
THEM GET THE BEST OF ME
AND RUIN MY MARRIAGE.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.886
THAT'S--

20:19.986 --> 20:23.022
ALL RIGHT, SO EXACTLY
WHAT KIND OF FEELINGS

20:23.122 --> 20:24.991
HAS THIS WOMAN
PROVOKED IN YOU?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.401
WHAT HAS
HE SAID TO YOU?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.837
KATE, ONLY PAUL
CAN ANSWER THAT.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.444
IT'S OKAY,
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.422
THIS IS WHY HE NEEDED
TO MAKE SOME SORT OF A...

20:55.522 --> 20:59.125
DECLARATION
OF COMMITMENT TO ME.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.193
THIS IS
HIS WAGGING FINGER.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.495
THIS IS HIS
"I DID NOT HAVE

21:02.595 --> 21:04.196
SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH THAT WOMAN."

21:04.297 --> 21:05.732
- BUT I DIDN'T.
- DOESN'T MATTER.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.200
THIS IS NOT NOTHING.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.770
IF THIS WERE NOTHING,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP HERE.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.105
IF THIS WERE
JUST SOME PATIENT

21:13.205 --> 21:15.608
WITH A SILLY CRUSH...

21:19.211 --> 21:21.147
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU'VE

21:21.247 --> 21:23.416
FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH SOME PATIENT

21:23.516 --> 21:25.718
THAT YOU'RE TREATING?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.425
LOOK, YOU HAVE
YOUR INSURANCE GUY.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.728
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY
THE OUTRAGED WIFE HERE.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.498
OKAY, HE'S NOT
AN INSURANCE GUY
AND YOU KNOW IT.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.132
- WHATEVER HE IS.
- THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER ONE

21:40.232 --> 21:41.534
OF YOUR STUPID,
PAINFUL JOKES.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.571
AND I DON'T GET
TO PLAY OUTRAGED? HUH.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.573
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN
THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO ME?

21:46.673 --> 21:48.608
WHILE YOU'VE BEEN
RUNNING AROUND LIKE
A GODDAMN MARTYR,

21:48.708 --> 21:51.611
THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE
CHASING SOME PATIENT.
JESUS CHRIST.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.613
ACTUALLY, LET ME GUESS.
WHAT IS SHE?

21:53.713 --> 21:55.848
SOME GIRL
WITH NO FATHER FIGURE?

21:55.948 --> 21:59.118
HE DIED? ABANDONED HER
WHEN SHE WAS 12?

21:59.218 --> 22:02.088
OH, HE LOVES THAT TYPE.
I'LL TELL YOU.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.356
HOW OLD IS SHE?

22:03.456 --> 22:05.592
WHAT TYPE, KATE?

22:05.692 --> 22:09.362
OH, GIRLS WITH THAT
PARTICULAR BRAND
OF DYSFUNCTION--

22:09.462 --> 22:10.763
A TASTY LITTLE
DADDY COMPLEX

22:10.863 --> 22:12.365
SO HE CAN SWEEP THEM
OFF THEIR FEET.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.567
IT'S DAYDREAMING,
THAT'S ALL.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.470
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE
MORE THAN DAYDREAMING.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.673
LOOK, I WANTED
TO COME CLEAN HERE.

22:20.773 --> 22:24.176
NOW YOU KNOW.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.312
THE REASON
I'M TELLING YOU IS

22:26.413 --> 22:28.715
BECAUSE I WANT IT
TO STOP.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.753
YOU WANT TO STOP WHAT?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.354
YOU WANNA STOP WANTING
TO FUCK PATIENTS?

22:35.455 --> 22:36.823
HOW DO YOU STOP THAT?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.791
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE MIGHT TRY
ACTING LIKE A COUPLE

22:38.891 --> 22:42.094
WHO ACTUALLY MIGHT
WANT TO BE TOGETHER.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.968
MAYBE YOU CAN
DESCRIBE TO KATE

22:49.068 --> 22:51.237
WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING
WITH THIS PATIENT,

22:51.337 --> 22:53.773
LIKE KATE DID
WITH EDWARD.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.142
LOOK, YOU CAN'T--

22:56.242 --> 22:58.945
YOU CAN'T COMPARE THE...

22:59.045 --> 23:01.714
SHE SLEPT WITH SOMEBODY.
I ALLOWED MYSELF A FANTASY.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.651
THAT'S ALL.
I NEVER ADMITTED IT
TO THIS WOMAN.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.986
I CERTAINLY NEVER
ACTED ON IT.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.488
BUT YOU WERE DYING TO.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.657
YES, I WAS DYING TO,
BUT I DIDN'T.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.062
ANYWAY,
SHE QUIT THERAPY.

23:16.162 --> 23:19.632
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
SHE QUIT THERAPY ON MONDAY.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.301
WELL, GOOD.
NOW YOU CAN FUCK HER
WITHOUT WORRYING...

23:22.401 --> 23:23.770
OR LOSING YOUR LICENSE.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.404
OR MAYBE NOW I CAN TRY
TO SAVE OUR MARRIAGE

23:25.505 --> 23:26.839
OR WHAT'S LEFT
OF OUR MARRIAGE

23:26.939 --> 23:29.041
WHICH, APPARENTLY,
ISN'T VERY MUCH.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.678
DID YOU SAY MONDAY?

23:31.778 --> 23:34.881
- MONDAY?
- MONDAY, YES.

23:36.683 --> 23:40.787
THAT'S WHY YOU WOULDN'T
GO WITH MAX ON A MONDAY?

23:40.887 --> 23:43.189
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO MISS YOUR SESSION
WITH THIS GIRL?

23:43.289 --> 23:44.957
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.228
MAX-- HE'S HAVING

23:49.328 --> 23:51.598
A LOT OF PROBLEMS
AT SCHOOL.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.733
THERE WAS
THIS CONFERENCE
WITH HIS TEACHERS

23:53.833 --> 23:57.136
AND PAUL WANTED
TO RESCHEDULE BECAUSE...

24:01.641 --> 24:03.175
I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.044
I KNEW IT.

24:05.144 --> 24:08.881
AND ALL YOUR SPEECHIFYING,
ALL YOUR FUCKING SANCTIMONY,

24:08.981 --> 24:10.817
WALKING AROUND LIKE
THE MORTALLY WOUNDED

24:10.917 --> 24:12.952
AND THE WHOLE TIME--
OH, JESUS.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.488
MAKES TOTAL SENSE NOW,
DOESN'T IT?

24:15.588 --> 24:18.090
A MILLION LITTLE THINGS.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.959
WHEN DID THIS START?

24:21.561 --> 24:23.229
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

24:23.329 --> 24:25.231
HOW LONG HAS WHAT
BEEN GOING ON?

24:25.331 --> 24:26.599
I TOLD YOU
NOTHING HAPPENED.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.300
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN THIS STARTED.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.569
IT STARTED A YEAR AGO,
DIDN'T IT?

24:29.669 --> 24:31.437
- AM I RIGHT?
- Paul: JESUS.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.139
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

24:33.239 --> 24:34.641
Kate:
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

24:34.741 --> 24:36.242
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

24:36.342 --> 24:39.078
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, PAUL?

24:39.178 --> 24:40.747
EDWARD,
HE WAS NOTHING.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.282
- NOTHING?
- Kate: CAN YOU SAY
IT'S NOTHING?

24:43.382 --> 24:45.417
CAN YOU SAY
IT'S NOTHING WITH THIS--

24:45.518 --> 24:46.786
WHAT'S HER NAME?
WHAT IS HER NAME?

24:46.886 --> 24:48.655
I CAN'T TELL YOU.
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.389
I WANT TO KNOW AND YOU'D
BETTER TELL ME, PAUL.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.124
I AM NOT FUCKING AROUND.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.694
LAURA.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.696
LAURA.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.668
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
IT'S NOTHING WITH LAURA?

25:09.441 --> 25:11.510
MY GOD.

25:13.245 --> 25:16.415
I MADE A MISTAKE.
I MADE A--

25:16.515 --> 25:19.552
WITH SOMEONE
I COULDN'T EVEN BE IN...

25:23.289 --> 25:24.891
GOD DAMN YOU.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.159
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY
IT'S NOTHING?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.962
BECAUSE IT ISN'T NOTHING.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.665
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.737
FUCK YOU.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.914
PAUL, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
HOW SHE'S FEELING.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.583
SHE CAME HERE WANTING
TO LEAVE HER AFFAIR BEHIND

25:50.683 --> 25:52.952
AND WORK
ON YOUR MARRIAGE.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.789
THEN SHE FINDS OUT
THAT YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.325
IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING, GINA.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.828
STILL...

26:03.262 --> 26:08.901
YOU'VE BOTH
BEEN PULLING AWAY
FROM THE RELATIONSHIP.

26:09.001 --> 26:12.304
NOW WHAT'S LEFT
IS TO FIGHT OVER WHO'S
BEEN HURT THE MOST.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.108
WHY?

26:16.208 --> 26:18.010
WHY IS ANYONE CHEATING?

26:19.245 --> 26:22.314
LOOKING TO SOMEONE ELSE
FOR A CONNECTION?

26:24.651 --> 26:27.353
HOW DID THE MARRIAGE END UP
FEELING THIS EMPTY?

26:34.627 --> 26:36.663
OKAY, THIS IS
A FIRST STEP.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.665
WE'LL KEEP LOOKING
AT THESE REACTIONS

26:38.765 --> 26:40.399
AND WHAT THEY MEAN,

26:40.499 --> 26:42.501
WHERE THEY STARTED.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.536
AS I SAID
IN THE BEGINNING,

26:44.637 --> 26:47.073
WE SHOULD MEET
A FEW TIMES

26:47.173 --> 26:50.376
AND THEN DECIDE TO GO ON
WITH COUPLES THERAPY

26:50.476 --> 26:53.279
OR SOME OTHER SOLUTION.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.814
Paul: OKAY.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.650
GINA, I'D LIKE TO PAY YOU
FOR MY SESSIONS SO FAR

26:57.750 --> 26:59.418
AND FOR THIS ONE AS WELL.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.420
NO, PAUL, WE DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT NOW.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.756
FIVE SESSIONS.
HOW MUCH--

27:03.856 --> 27:05.892
PAUL, AS YOU SAID
IN THE BEGINNING,

27:05.992 --> 27:08.127
SOME LINES HAVE
BEEN BLURRED HERE.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.296
SO, I HAVEN'T EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.700
LET ME FIGURE IT OUT
AND I'LL SEND YOU A BILL.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.267
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.307
WHAT EXACTLY
AM I GOING HOME WITH?

27:23.542 --> 27:26.612
WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO

27:26.713 --> 27:29.181
WITH THIS BEFORE--
FOR OUR NEXT INSTALLMENT?

27:33.085 --> 27:36.488
KATE, YOU CAN
CALL ME ANYTIME.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.157
PAUL, YOU KNOW THAT.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.226
AND IF YOU WANT TO MEET
BEFORE NEXT FRIDAY,

27:40.326 --> 27:42.194
IT'S FINE. I'M HERE.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.865
( Kate sniffles )

27:57.409 --> 27:58.610
THANKS, GINA.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.246
TAKE CARE, PAUL.
