WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:05.755
Come on in.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.424
What'd I do now?

00:08.550 --> 00:12.345
Nothing. You are acting
lieutenant today.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.139
Okay.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.641
It's my fault. Casey and Dawson,

00:16.767 --> 00:19.143
they have this charity thing
over at Chicago Med

00:19.269 --> 00:20.937
and I forgot to file
the paperwork for him.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.106
I've already got Rafferty
covering for Dawson.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.233
You've got to tell me
ahead of time, Chief.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.193
I got to get prepared mentally.
I got...

00:29.947 --> 00:31.239
Right. Got you covered.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.615
Thank you.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.450
- Close the door.
- Yeah.

00:35.411 --> 00:38.037
Participants competing in
today's Race Against Cancer

00:38.163 --> 00:39.580
please make sure you register

00:39.707 --> 00:41.499
at least 30 minutes
before the race begins.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.335
Remember,
this is a non-profit event.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.879
Really? Goat shirts?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.923
Those are collector's items.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.135
- Yeah, garbage collectors.
- You guys going to run the 10k?

00:52.261 --> 00:55.012
Uh, I am. Casey chickened out.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.556
More of a sprinter.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.599
You going to introduce
the Commissioner later?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.268
I'm not sure how that fell on me.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.354
A ceiling fell on you
while you were saving a baby, baby.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.106
- Darn it!
- I got it.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.569
Hey. It's... It's Kim, right?

01:09.695 --> 01:12.321
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hey, you... You need some help?

01:13.532 --> 01:15.158
I... I kind of have
no idea what I'm doing.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.620
She was part of the team
that got Diego back.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.038
On it.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.042
Firefighters bailing out cops
is a long tradition.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.878
Oh, okay.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.921
Well, when you need
a police officer to...

01:30.632 --> 01:32.884
- I got nothing.
- Heh, heh.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.845
- Who's this?
- Oh, this is my niece Zoe.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.555
- How old are you, Zoe?
- I'm nine.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.432
Really? Let me see
your driver's license.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.602
- I'm nine, too.
- Wow!

01:42.728 --> 01:44.437
Well, uh, you're the
designated driver

01:44.563 --> 01:46.314
because she doesn't
have her license.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.316
Imogene, don't bother them.
They're setting up.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.234
Oh, no, it's totally fine.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.904
Do you want to go see them unload
the animals for the petting zoo?

01:54.031 --> 01:55.114
Go ahead.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.617
- Stay where I can see you.
- Okay.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.244
- You're the new pediatrician, right?
- Yeah, Holly Thelan.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.747
Nice to meet you.
I just moved here from New York.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.832
Welcome. Thanks for volunteering
on your day off.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.168
Yeah, my pleasure.
I'll see you guys.

02:09.755 --> 02:13.132
Hey, I guess I'll go get
started with registration.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.426
Okay, have a good race.
I'll be rooting for you.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.484
Oh, hey! Dr Arata.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.320
- Gabriela Dawson.
- Dawson.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.530
Yes?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.782
Do you know where
the race registration is?

02:37.908 --> 02:41.035
Race reg...
Uh, I'm sorry, Dawson.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.663
I'm kind of busy saving lives.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.540
Oh, be nice, Dr Arata.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.668
They're doing the race registration
over in A wing.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.004
Great. Thank you.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.842
I'm gonna go talk to Gabby.
You got this?

02:55.968 --> 02:57.343
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.137
All runners, please report
to the Registration Desk.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.557
Let's go see the animals!

03:03.433 --> 03:04.517
Wait for me!

03:05.561 --> 03:08.437
Hey, I like the balloons.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.759
Help! Help!

04:33.607 --> 04:35.399
Somebody, over here!

04:47.537 --> 04:51.374
Girls! Girls, can you hear me?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.292
- Are you hurt?
- My head.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.710
My tummy hurts.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.504
Hey, what's your name?

04:56.630 --> 04:57.755
- Vaughn.
- Vaughn.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.757
I need you to run
to the other side of the hospital

04:59.883 --> 05:01.175
and check to see if ICU is intact.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.136
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, my God! Zoe!

05:04.262 --> 05:06.973
Imogene got knocked in the head.
Zoe said her stomach hurts.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.475
- This man has passed out.
- Im?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.852
Im, talk to me, sweetheart.
You know where you are?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.813
I'm at the race.
That's right, honey.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.982
Are you okay, baby?
What happened?

05:16.108 --> 05:18.609
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.611
Okay. I think she might
have a cracked rib.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.496
Hey. ER's gone.
We'll use that tent as triage.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.956
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.667
- Im, grab onto me, sweetheart, okay?
- Ow! It hurts.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.086
Everyone, this tent
will serve as triage!

05:37.212 --> 05:40.297
Start moving people off the street
and out of the rubble!

05:40.424 --> 05:42.591
Anyone that can help us,
help us!

05:43.802 --> 05:45.845
- Can you move?
- I think so.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.940
You got this, Herrmann.
Lieutenant.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.736
Every bit of training we've had
was for today, boys.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.040
Rafferty, grab everything
off the ambulance.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.550
Chief! Chief! Big explosion,
no idea of the cause.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.177
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.013
Triage is in that tent.
ER took it hard.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.182
People are gonna be trapped
up on those higher floors.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.100
You, Otis, and Mouch,
get the aerial moving.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.310
On it.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.229
Exterior oxygen and fuel tanks
are on the other side of the building.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.149
- This couldn't have been an accident.
- A bomb?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.943
The structure's unstable.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.363
Where's Dawson?

06:46.490 --> 06:49.366
Oh, God. She went inside.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.160
- Dawson's in there?
- I think so.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.496
- We'll get her.
- Go!

06:54.873 --> 06:56.415
Cruz, Mills, stay back!

06:57.793 --> 06:59.794
You did bomb-tech training
with Squad, right?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.838
- You tell me what you think.
- Car bombing.

07:02.964 --> 07:06.175
- It looks just like Oklahoma City.
- That's just what I thought.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.470
So what do we know? If there's one
car bomb, there's probably a second.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.681
- We're on it.
- Yeah. Go.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.642
Let's go check the structure.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.492
She... She said the pain's
getting worse.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.327
Imogene is my sister.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.622
I think she has a concussion,
but she's responsive and alert.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.832
Zoe.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.710
- Kim, is this your girl?
- No, I'm her aunt.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.338
- I'm trying to call my sister.
- She says she has stomach pain.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.049
We got to take a look
in there somehow, now.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.426
I'm gonna head in and see
if radiology is up and running.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.594
All right, I'll go with you.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.180
If there's more injured inside,
I want to help.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.850
You radio me as soon as you know
a CT scanner is up.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.143
You got it.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.061
Girls, be strong.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.939
Im, take care of Zoe.
I'll be back, okay?

08:05.152 --> 08:08.445
Zoe, squeeze the pain into me.
I can take it.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.210
Fire Department!
Call out!

08:32.137 --> 08:33.554
I got you!

08:38.435 --> 08:41.729
- You got him?
- Yeah. Got him.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.315
Call out!

08:46.401 --> 08:48.903
Gabby? Call out!

08:52.157 --> 08:54.408
- Hey! Dr Arata, right?
- Yeah.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.785
Did Gabby Dawson come in here?
Did you see her?

08:56.912 --> 08:59.705
Dawson. I did. I left her
at the nurses' station.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.124
She on this floor?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.752
Hey! Casey, there's a
ton of pockets in here.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.045
We'll find her.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.592
Hey! If you can move at all,
get away from the exposed wall!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.260
- Move back towards the center!
- Okay.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.971
Gabby! Anyone! Call out!

09:16.097 --> 09:19.975
Sir, you had a head injury
and you need a cat scan, okay?

09:30.195 --> 09:33.656
- Are you okay?

09:38.578 --> 09:42.373
Yeah. Yeah, it's...
It's just a little scratch.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.583
- Look, if you need...
- No, I'm, uh...

09:44.709 --> 09:46.460
I'm good. Just...
Let's keep going.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.004
Okay.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.637
Look for a rental car
or a van parked near the building.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.889
It'll have a rental tag
in the front windshield

09:59.015 --> 10:00.307
and that license plate border.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.309
Copy that, Chief.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.188
Steve! You hold your men back.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.649
We believe it's a car bomb.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.567
We're searching for
a possible second nearby.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.361
Ain't no reason to have more men...

10:12.487 --> 10:15.114
I'll be damned if you think
you're gonna keep us out of here.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.536
Okay, we got sector one
and two, here and here.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.329
You move your men
to three and four.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.206
We got triage going
over in the tent.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.334
I just got word from the other side
of the hospital. They are undamaged.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.211
Okay, let's go, men.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.964
Don't look back tomorrow
and say you could've done more!

10:35.051 --> 10:37.428
- Cruz, talk to me.
- Nothing yet, Chief.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.306
Yo! Over here! Rental car.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.975
There's a blanket in the back!

10:44.602 --> 10:46.395
Nothing underneath.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.842
All clean. Let's keep moving.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.186
- Yeah. Rafferty.
- Go for Rafferty.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.688
Okay, we got a working cat scan
in the trauma wing.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.398
On my way.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.652
- Let's see what's going on with Zoe.
- I'm coming, too.

11:35.779 --> 11:39.198
- No, sweetie, you should stay here.
- She's my friend and I'm coming.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.244
Guys, I need a lift.

11:53.296 --> 11:56.256
Help! Up here!

11:56.383 --> 11:58.300
Don't move! We're coming!

11:59.969 --> 12:01.929
Don't even breathe on those walls.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.931
Roger that.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.650
Hey!

12:15.735 --> 12:18.695
Hey! Seriously? What's your problem?

12:18.822 --> 12:20.197
We need to get this man out of here.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.908
Here, take him.

12:23.034 --> 12:27.162
Hey, listen! A lot of people need
to get out of here, all right?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.377
Casey, get back!

12:40.885 --> 12:42.344
Casey!

12:43.221 --> 12:45.305
I'm okay. I'm okay.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.729
- Hey, stand back.
- No, you get back.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.357
This is Alim Al Safir, Ambassador
from Syria to the United States.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.943
Ambassador Safir was here
in your city's protection.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.027
- Capp!
- If he's dead...

12:59.154 --> 13:01.113
Capp, Tony, get this guy
to the A wing.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.698
Got it.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.703
- Hey, Severide?
- Yeah!

13:07.829 --> 13:10.289
There's plenty of room
under the debris, the way it's fallen.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.958
I'm going in.
If Gabby's under there...

13:13.084 --> 13:14.835
I don't know if that's safe.
You get stuck...

13:14.961 --> 13:17.254
We won't get stuck.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.762
Casey!

13:27.807 --> 13:29.057
Ready?

14:44.676 --> 14:46.260
- Dr Thelan.
- Dr Arata.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.845
So, it's your tummy?

14:48.972 --> 14:50.639
She says the pain's
getting worse, fast.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.850
Hmm. Let's see.

15:01.776 --> 15:05.028
We're gonna take a look.
Everyone clear out, please.

15:06.364 --> 15:10.242
- I'll be right outside.
- Come on, Imogene.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.704
- Just stay very still. All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.208
- Ow!
- It's okay.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.085
- Leslie.
- Yeah?

15:20.211 --> 15:22.546
- Dawson's missing.
- What?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.006
Apparently she was near the blast.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.717
- I'm gonna go help.
- No, no, no.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.343
The guys are doing
everything they can.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.972
We do our jobs,
no matter what, right?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.517
Guess you're right.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.564
I'm coming with you.
Im, just stay here, okay?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.065
Is Zoe going to be okay?

15:42.191 --> 15:46.236
She's has the best doctor
in the city with her. I'll be back.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.836
- How you doing?
- I could be better.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.465
- Bad day at the hospital, huh?
- Please don't joke.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.300
Anybody else here
in the room with you?

16:08.426 --> 16:10.761
- No. Clearly.
- You'll be all right.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.805
Please.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.478
All right, listen, lady.
You got to relax.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.606
- It's "Doctor."
- My apologies, Doctor.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.318
But if you don't relax, I'm gonna call
you a lot worse.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.957
All right, swing her out!
Swing her out.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.419
Got her!

16:46.422 --> 16:49.466
I checked everything in both lots,
and I got... nothing.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.353
Chief... We found our second bomb.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.481
Where?

17:06.984 --> 17:10.654
Northwest parking structure.
Close to the hospital.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.700
Steve! When's that Bomb Squad
gonna get here?

17:14.826 --> 17:16.118
Ten minutes.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.286
I'm on my way.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.628
Gabby! Hello!

17:29.340 --> 17:35.053
Hey! Gabby! Anyone! Call out!

17:37.849 --> 17:40.058
- Casey.
- Yeah?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.060
If we don't find a space
big enough to turn around,

17:42.186 --> 17:44.354
we're gonna have
to do this backwards.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.523
It might not be
the smartest course of action.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.692
We're gonna be smart about this now?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.696
No. Keep going.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.032
- It hurts.
- I know, honey. I'm sorry.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.410
- It hurts so bad.
- I'm sorry.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.538
Can I speak to you for a moment?

18:06.419 --> 18:10.756
Your niece has a crushed liver.
She's bleeding internally.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.841
I need to operate
before she bleeds out.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.384
Oh, my God.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.470
Do you have authority
to give consent?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.221
Consent? I don't know. I...

18:18.347 --> 18:20.557
That's good enough for me.
We'll get her ready.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.482
Make a hole!

18:30.902 --> 18:33.195
- Nurse, we'll take that gurney.
- Okay.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.907
- Doctor!
- What?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.658
This man, he's in bad shape.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.748
He's not in bad shape.
He's dead.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.519
Cruz, hand me your center punch.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.240
Cruz, Mills...

20:02.743 --> 20:04.744
I'm gonna ask you
to leave the area.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.747
- Forget it.
- Not a chance.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.501
It's on a timer.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.551
Can't see what
it's set for, though.

21:01.677 --> 21:05.055
Yeah, this is amateur hour.
Bomb Making 101.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.600
- Which means?
- It could go off at any moment.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.730
So...

21:15.232 --> 21:16.816
Can you?

21:21.405 --> 21:23.031
Yeah.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.495
Careful, Mills.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.795
Hey, Tone!
Where's Severide and Casey?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.463
Down there somewhere.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.383
All right, let's spread out.
Let's go, guys.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.635
Dig 'em out.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.067
I see someone!

22:04.115 --> 22:06.199
Call out if you can hear me!

22:11.414 --> 22:13.665
- It's not her!
- What?

22:16.877 --> 22:18.336
- She's dead.
- What?

22:18.462 --> 22:20.922
It's not Dawson!

22:33.728 --> 22:35.645
Oh, thank the sweet Lord.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.689
For anyone who's not tagged...

22:38.607 --> 22:41.026
It looks like all these people
have been seen.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.319
Not here. Down there.

23:00.713 --> 23:01.755
Let's go.

23:03.799 --> 23:04.924
Yeah.

23:15.352 --> 23:19.981
Okay, it's 8:29. If this thing is set
to go at 8:30...

23:20.107 --> 23:21.608
Chief!

23:22.777 --> 23:25.779
Respectfully, shut up.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.113
Cover your ears.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.448
Are you serious?

24:39.270 --> 24:41.271
Amateur hour.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.523
God bless
that Rescue Squad training!

24:43.649 --> 24:46.109
Come on!

24:49.864 --> 24:51.656
Marker.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.913
Have suction ready.
This isn't gonna be pretty.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.843
Retractor.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.639
Bowel retractor.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.026
The liver looks even worse
than it did on the cat scan.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.779
I can't find the bleed.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.033
Uh, give me a clamp
for a pringle maneuver.

25:40.039 --> 25:46.711
Uh, she's stable for now.
But, uh, she's getting worse.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.089
There's nothing left of the liver.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.383
I can't stop the bleeding.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.223
What... What does that mean?
You can fix her, right?

25:58.349 --> 26:00.600
You can transplant a liver,
but you can't fix the damage...

26:00.726 --> 26:02.227
I'll donate right now.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.645
Do you have
the same blood type?

26:03.771 --> 26:05.605
I'm, um... I'm A positive.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.150
No, your niece is O positive.
It wouldn't work.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.987
But I've tried...
I've tried calling my sister

26:13.113 --> 26:16.741
and I have tried calling my parents
and no one's picking up.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.953
She's only nine years old!

26:20.079 --> 26:24.207
You know what? Stay here.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.798
Gabby! Anyone! Call out!

26:40.391 --> 26:43.935
Gabby! Gabby!

26:44.061 --> 26:46.145
Call out!

27:04.248 --> 27:06.165
Help.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.127
Help.

27:37.614 --> 27:41.617
Come on, come, come.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.985
- I hear something.
- Keep going.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.488
The space up ahead is too small.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.323
You can do it.
I'm right behind you.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.952
Hey, Herrmann?
Can you hear the banging?

28:29.333 --> 28:31.876
Hey! Quiet everyone!

28:32.002 --> 28:33.795
Quiet!

28:35.381 --> 28:36.714
Kill that torch!

28:44.348 --> 28:47.225
- Is that you, Severide?
- No.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.605
That's from over there!

28:58.570 --> 29:00.238
We need a medic out here.

29:01.365 --> 29:04.075
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.537
Take a rest.
I'm gonna go back out front.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.289
I promise I'll radio
with anything they find.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.495
I'm gonna head up to check on Zoe.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.498
All right. I'll, uh...
I'll come with you.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.384
Hey, trooper.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.219
You were gone a long time.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.513
Yeah, we were just trying to help
who we could.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.520
She's hurt, isn't she?
Worse than we thought?

30:17.232 --> 30:19.233
She is. Very.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.406
Good thoughts, you know?

30:27.075 --> 30:28.826
That's all you can give,
give good thoughts.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.204
Yeah. Good thoughts.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.955
Yeah.

30:36.084 --> 30:42.048
Imogene! Imogene!

30:42.174 --> 30:42.507
Hey!
We need help over here!

30:42.508 --> 30:43.508
Hey!
We need help over here!

30:43.634 --> 30:44.800
I need a line.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.844
Get a line in her.
2.5 diazepam IV push.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.054
- Get her head.
- What is it?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.890
Seizure. Okay, we need
that broken arm out of two!

30:54.895 --> 30:57.355
She was fine... She was talking.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.023
She was near the explosion?

30:59.149 --> 31:04.362
Yes. It looked like a concussion.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.572
Pupil's blown,
got to be an epidural hematoma,

31:06.698 --> 31:08.074
blood swelling the brain.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.202
Get her a CT and an open
operating room immediately!

31:12.412 --> 31:13.538
I'll do this.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.554
- Dr Arata, we need...
- Out of the way!

31:30.889 --> 31:34.392
What's that, what's that...
O positive. Yes!

32:08.218 --> 32:09.885
Gabby!

32:12.055 --> 32:13.347
Gabby!

32:16.268 --> 32:17.685
Gabby!

32:21.648 --> 32:23.316
You came.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.984
How bad?

32:25.110 --> 32:28.696
It's just my head,
but I think I'm okay.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.865
You okay?

32:32.826 --> 32:34.201
Damn, Dawson.
You look like hell.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.996
I'm not 100% sure
I'm not dreaming.

32:37.122 --> 32:40.374
For real!

32:47.716 --> 32:50.843
Hey, guys,
Casey and I have Dawson. She's alive.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.265
Yeah!

33:00.979 --> 33:02.647
We're not out of
the woods yet, boys!

33:02.773 --> 33:05.691
Let's get this
concrete off of them! Let's go!

33:17.579 --> 33:20.122
I got your message.
How is she?

33:31.677 --> 33:34.345
You got to believe, okay?

33:35.514 --> 33:37.306
You just got to believe.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.809
Greta! It's O positive!

33:39.935 --> 33:41.435
That's good, right?

33:41.561 --> 33:43.521
- We'll start prepping.
- It's a chance.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.815
It's an adult liver,
but we just use the left lobe.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.131
I see 'em!

34:12.467 --> 34:14.343
Everyone careful now!

34:14.469 --> 34:16.053
All right.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.768
No, no.

34:22.894 --> 34:26.480
Something must have happened to it
in the explosion.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.651
It's warm.

34:37.492 --> 34:41.537
The, uh, liver seemed to be damaged,
maybe in the explosion.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.416
I can't use it.

34:46.543 --> 34:47.793
I'm sorry.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.364
Drop the basket.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.748
Ready to get out of here?

35:25.874 --> 35:27.374
Yeah.

35:29.002 --> 35:32.046
I love you. Lift her up!

36:00.450 --> 36:02.409
That's right! Ladies first.

36:49.833 --> 36:52.334
- Terrorism?
- Possibly.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.504
The Ambassador to Syria was checked into
Chicago Med for a liver transplant.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.716
Alim Al Safir. That's his security
detail over there.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.760
One of them flashed his weapon
at a fireman.

37:15.692 --> 37:19.194
Hey, friends.
I'm aware of your sidearms.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.280
I have one of my own.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.740
We're diplomatic protection

37:22.866 --> 37:25.034
within our legal right
to bear arms in this country.

37:25.160 --> 37:29.038
Not today. I'm gonna take
your weapons from you.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.414
This isn't a question.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.750
Do anything that makes me
the least bit uncomfortable,

37:32.876 --> 37:34.960
I will end you,
do you understand?

37:35.086 --> 37:38.923
We are diplomatic protection
from the Syrian Arab Republic!

37:57.692 --> 37:59.526
We will cooperate any way we can.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.621
We're gonna want first crack
at questioning.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.459
I'll wait my turn.
Just know it's coming.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.736
Come on. Come on.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.699
Pupils unresponsive.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.618
Come on, girl.
Give me something.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.092
Hey, Chief,
the Commissioner's here.

39:16.813 --> 39:18.313
Wallace?

39:19.983 --> 39:21.358
Fire Commissioner.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.486
The Deputy District Chief
just brought me up to speed.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.113
Dark day, sir.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.740
That, it is.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.492
Listen, I am informed
that you and your men

39:30.618 --> 39:35.164
from Firehouse 81 were first on scene
and saved dozens of lives today.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.418
Yeah. Plus one of our own.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.879
Well... You can fall back.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.089
Let some relief do some digging.

40:03.443 --> 40:04.860
We think we'll stay.

40:27.884 --> 40:31.720
Shay, we got Dawson.
She's okay.

40:34.808 --> 40:36.892
Shay?

40:40.396 --> 40:42.773
Hey! We need
a doctor over here!
