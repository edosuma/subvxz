WEBVTT

00:09.676 --> 00:10.593
Love you!

00:10.677 --> 00:11.678
Love you!

00:11.761 --> 00:16.224
-That girl is so cool, right?
-She's the fucking coolest.

00:16.307 --> 00:19.519
She just left,
and you already want to text her!

00:19.602 --> 00:23.231
Yeah, and I don't want her to be friends
with anybody else, ever. Why is that?

00:23.314 --> 00:25.567
Because you love her, honey.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.111
That's why I'm here. I'm your lovebug.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.654
My "lovebug"?

00:29.738 --> 00:32.574
Okay! You and a girl?
Yeah, I can work with that.

00:32.657 --> 00:35.785
Did you know I am
a board-certified cunnilingus doula?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.829
But my website says "Pussy Eating Coach."

00:37.912 --> 00:39.914
Okay, hold on. I'm into guys.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.458
Oh, that's true.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.044
She fucks Judd's shirt.
She might be into shirts.

00:44.127 --> 00:48.798
Ladies, I'm not talking about sex,
I'm talking about love.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.676
The love between two best friends.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.596
-You want to be Ali's number one.
-I do!

00:54.679 --> 00:57.140
-You want to buy cheap matching necklaces.
-Yeah!

00:57.223 --> 00:59.726
And choreograph stupid dances together!

00:59.809 --> 01:03.730
-We'll get a shared TikTok account.
-And you'll have your own secret language!

01:03.813 --> 01:05.106
That's right!

01:05.190 --> 01:07.358
We're gonna annoy
the fuck out of everybody,

01:07.442 --> 01:09.319
and it's gonna be nogawooski!

01:09.402 --> 01:12.030
-What does that mean?
-I can't tell you, you're not Ali.

01:12.113 --> 01:12.947
Oh, I love that.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.408
Hey, guys, I want to be part of this too.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.326
Ow!

01:16.409 --> 01:19.454
Oh! I fell on my nogawooski!

01:19.537 --> 01:21.790
-Did I use it right?
-Mm, no, not at all.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.875
Oh, nogawooski!

01:23.958 --> 01:25.251
-How 'bout that time?
-Nope.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.169
Shit!

02:00.411 --> 02:01.621
Ooh, there's Ali!

02:01.704 --> 02:04.624
Hurry, sit next to her!
Hip check that human jelly donut!

02:04.707 --> 02:07.210
-Hey! You spilled my breakfast Sprite.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.253
Hey, girl!

02:08.336 --> 02:12.757
Jessi, finally!
We are local-ass celebrities!

02:12.841 --> 02:15.635
I can't believe they're getting
all the credit for my idea!

02:15.718 --> 02:17.428
Those fucking slags!

02:17.512 --> 02:19.013
Oh! What's a slag?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.723
It's a term for a skeezy bitch,

02:20.807 --> 02:23.226
-who is not nogawooski.
-Ugh!

02:23.309 --> 02:26.604
Vice Junior posted about us,
and the Internet went banar-nar.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.522
Nice!

02:27.605 --> 02:31.818
We are now officially the Bridgeton
Fightin' Steven Van Zandts.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.571
-Those cops even had to apologize!

02:34.654 --> 02:39.367
We'd like to formally apologize for
arresting those two teenage vandals.

02:39.450 --> 02:44.539
Ahem. As is protocol in the department,
we will now publicly embarrass ourselves

02:44.622 --> 02:47.959
by dressing like the aggrieved party
of those we wrongfully arrested.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.002
Here we go.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.087
Not gonna lie, I feel beautiful.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.714
-"I love the way

02:52.797 --> 02:55.675
that little girl's tank top
shows off my cop shoulders."

02:55.758 --> 02:58.011
"Let's take
the squad car over there

02:58.094 --> 03:00.013
to the Forever 21 here, there, now."

03:00.096 --> 03:02.056
-Hey, babe, what's that voice?

03:02.140 --> 03:05.768
It's just one of the cops who arrested us
here, there, now, over there--

03:05.852 --> 03:08.062
-You really had to be there, ma'am.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.649
I wish I had a windbreaker, because
I'm on the outside of this inside joke.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.737
Ugh! Why did I profess my love to Jessi
when I could have just not?

03:15.820 --> 03:17.947
Because, honey, you had to!

03:18.031 --> 03:20.909
You love her
with all the heart in your giant head.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.785
But now I have to be
in the same room as her.

03:22.869 --> 03:23.995
Not for long, baby!

03:24.078 --> 03:26.623
I'm digging us a hole
to the center of the Earth!

03:26.706 --> 03:28.416
You can live with the rock people!

03:28.499 --> 03:30.627
You're not going anywhere, Nick!

03:30.710 --> 03:33.922
Like my special work hat,
'cause I glued it on my head, baby!

03:34.005 --> 03:37.425
-Love doesn't back down, it doubles down!
-Okay.

03:37.508 --> 03:41.512
You need to show her that
you know her better than anyone else.

03:41.596 --> 03:46.309
That you hold a PhD
in Jess-onomics from Glazer State.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.394
Or maybe I should,
like, get her something.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.021
Girls like stuff, like objects.

03:50.104 --> 03:53.316
Yes! A gift. A token of your affection.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.401
Ooh! Give her my hat!

03:55.485 --> 03:56.361
Oh, good Lord!

03:56.444 --> 03:58.988
-Uh-oh! There goes the neighborhood!
-Ew!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.032
Okay, listen up, everybody.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.118
Sadly, Ms. Raths is back in rehab.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.704
Ugh! The woman is a gambling addict.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.166
So, I'm your sub, Mr. Keating,
and today, I want to introduce you

04:10.250 --> 04:15.463
to somebody you might not think
is very cool, but I personally love.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.091
Bill fucking Shakespeare!

04:18.174 --> 04:20.093
Maury! Teacher cursed!

04:20.176 --> 04:22.470
This guy is premium cable cool!

04:22.553 --> 04:24.264
Now, if you could, do me a favor

04:24.347 --> 04:28.017
and, uh, get rid of those fucking books!

04:28.101 --> 04:30.561
Fuck yeah, he did it again.
He said "fuck" again.

04:30.645 --> 04:34.399
Now you won't find
the real Shakespeare in some old book.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.859
Shakespeare is right here

04:36.943 --> 04:40.655
because he wrote about all the same shit
you guys are going through right now.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.365
You love each other, right?

04:42.448 --> 04:45.118
You hate each other,
you betray each other…

04:45.201 --> 04:47.328
You fuck your skank-ass pillows

04:47.412 --> 04:50.498
and ruin the one good thing you had
in your miserable life!

04:50.581 --> 04:52.709
Well, well, well,
someone's read The Tempest.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.626
What's up?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.212
But today we're actually starting
with Othello,

04:56.296 --> 05:00.091
which is all about jealousy.

05:00.174 --> 05:04.178
It drives Othello to madness and murder!

05:04.262 --> 05:07.181
"Beware, my Lord, of jealousy.

05:07.265 --> 05:13.604
It is the green-eyed monster
which doth mock the meat it feeds on!"

05:13.688 --> 05:18.484
Is this guy fucking Bounty?
Because I am absorbed.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.195
Not me, I'm sopping wet.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.991
So be real with me, guys.
Middle school sucks, right?

05:25.074 --> 05:28.870
And I know some of you are feeling
that green-eyed monster right now.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.079
Oh, yes, yes. Me!

05:30.163 --> 05:34.292
Me, Mr. Keating. I'm jealous every time
I go to my friend Nick's house.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.753
His parents are nice
and he has the good snacks,

05:36.836 --> 05:38.504
and that's why I hate him.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.630
What? You hate me?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.382
Oh, shut the fuck up.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.676
I don't hate you.
I hate the life you live.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.553
All right, little dude.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.347
Very brave of you to share that.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.389
I like your energy.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.600
You hear that? He likes my energy.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.269
-Ooh, you're gonna be the teacher's pet.
-Yeah.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.732
Wear a leash and shit on the grass
while you stare directly into his eyes.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.943
Oh, yeah, I made a big one, Mr. Keating.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.781
Hold my warm shit in your hand
and tell me I'm a good boy.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.116
Okay, school's finally over.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.619
-Now we can have Ali all to ourselves.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.621
Invite her over for chip salad.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.374
That's a big bowl
with all different kinds of chips.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.542
So, Ali, what are we doing now?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.211
We're doing chip salad, dummy!

06:18.294 --> 06:21.172
Oh, uh, well,
Samira's parents are working late,

06:21.255 --> 06:24.258
so we were just gonna go to her house
and finger each other all afternoon.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.218
Oh, okay.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.595
Sorry, it's hard
to choose anything over fingering.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.305
Bye there, over there.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.599
That quiet little creep!

06:36.187 --> 06:37.772
What the hell was that?

06:37.855 --> 06:39.607
You became a green-eyed monster,

06:39.690 --> 06:42.360
like Othello in that book
your teacher kicked!

06:42.443 --> 06:45.780
I'm not jealous. It's not like
I want to be Ali's girlfriend.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.698
But you want to be her number one!

06:47.782 --> 06:50.952
Also, Samira sucks ass through a straw!

06:51.035 --> 06:53.204
Yeah! Through a big boba tea straw.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.706
Yeah, boba butt!
Chew on that boba butt, you bitch!

06:55.790 --> 06:57.125
Boba bubble-butt bitch!

06:58.376 --> 07:04.841
My lord, as you gaze upon Jayzerian,
your sword swells with penis nectar.

07:04.924 --> 07:05.925
Maury, what are you doing?

07:06.008 --> 07:08.136
The new teacher's
got me horny for Shakespeare.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.095
Oh, dear!

07:09.178 --> 07:12.181
Make haste!
Tell Jay you've discarded Aiden,

07:12.265 --> 07:16.310
that he may lay his pearly eggs
upon thine chest.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.980
Ugh. Please don't talk that way
this entire episode.

07:19.063 --> 07:22.650
Hey, Charles!
If you're gonna get serious about magic,

07:22.733 --> 07:24.652
-you gotta have your own deck.
-Cool.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.738
I drew tits on all the queens
and dicks on all the kings.

07:27.822 --> 07:32.201
Don't think I forgot about those jacks,
because those guys are jackin' off.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.204
-Thanks.
-So, last night was cool, right?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.289
The magic was sick.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.499
The magic was so sick!

07:38.583 --> 07:41.377
Almost as sick as your mouth
when we hardcore frenched.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.172
-See you later, dude.
-Okay, dude. Uh, enjoy the cards.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.884
I wish I was one of them so I could
feel your hot fingers all over my three.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.136
Three's my butt.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.513
Oh, uh, hello.

07:52.597 --> 07:58.186
Oh, Thello, m'lord. I doff my cap to thee,
for ye teach-eth like a summer's eve.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.355
There's that great energy again,
but you can talk normally.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.275
Oh, I shan't,
for you hath bewitched me.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.486
-Well, Billy Shakes can do that.
-Ha-ha!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.529
"All the world's a stage,

08:08.613 --> 08:11.199
and all the men and women merely players."

08:11.282 --> 08:13.701
Wow, I normally hate this kind of shit,

08:13.784 --> 08:16.037
but you make it sound fun,
like Jack Sparrow.

08:16.120 --> 08:16.954
Thank you?

08:17.038 --> 08:21.000
Why the hell are you wasting your time
with a bunch of loser, idiot kids?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.543
You should be a big-time actor.

08:22.627 --> 08:27.006
Yeah, well, I have been doing
a weekly show. "Shakes Beer in the Bar."

08:27.089 --> 08:29.217
So you're treading the boards.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.385
Very, very cool, Mr. Keating.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.762
Hey, man, you can call me Dylan.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.472
Okay, Dylan.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.604
You know you have
a very irregular heartbeat, right?

08:41.687 --> 08:44.899
Yeah.
My doctor says I have "Grandpa heart."

08:46.567 --> 08:49.529
Oh, hey, Nick.
A skunk ran through the apartment,

08:49.612 --> 08:50.530
-is that smell.
-Uh-huh.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.698
Want a pizza bagel
smothered in peanut butter?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.368
Uh, no, thanks, Mr. Glazer.
I-is Jessi home?

08:55.451 --> 08:57.161
Sorry, bud.
She's out to dinner with her mom.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.872
Oh. Okay. I just got her
a little something and I thought--

08:59.956 --> 09:02.166
Oh, shit, is it Jessi's birthday?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.960
Oh, it's not Jessi's birthday.

09:04.043 --> 09:08.089
I--I got her something special
to show her how well I know her.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.342
It's a Ruth Bader Ginsburg action figure.
It--it planks.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.554
Very cool.
Can we say it's from Nick and Dad?

09:14.637 --> 09:16.347
Uh, no. It's from me.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.974
Right on. You can leave it in her room.

09:18.057 --> 09:18.891
Is that weird or…

09:18.975 --> 09:20.893
No weirder than that skunk
in my apartment.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.854
Hello,
I'm super high.

09:23.938 --> 09:28.150
Let's melt a bowl of chocolate chips
and watch The Matrix trilogy.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.860
Are we sure about this?

09:29.944 --> 09:33.531
Yes! Women love to find surprises
in their most intimate places.

09:33.614 --> 09:34.490
They do?

09:34.574 --> 09:35.491
That's it!

09:35.575 --> 09:38.077
You should leave the gift
under her pillow!

09:38.160 --> 09:40.538
No way, man,
put it in her underwears drawer!

09:40.621 --> 09:43.541
-Huh?
-Then we can sneak a peek at her socks.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.334
I insist on the pillow, Nick.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.920
-Okay.
-You'll be a sensual tooth fairy.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.299
Wait, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, is-- is this Judd's shirt?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.301
Why would she have your brother's shirt?

09:53.384 --> 09:56.345
Oh, my God.
Have Jessi and Judd been hooking up?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.763
That son of a bitch!

09:57.847 --> 09:59.599
Put her birthday present in the trash!

09:59.682 --> 10:02.268
Yes, and destroy that revolting shirt.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.353
Zip, zap, take a shit on that.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.274
Turn the pillow over
and let her sleep in your scat!

10:08.357 --> 10:12.820
No! If the shirt's gone and she talks
to her dad, she'll know it was me.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.740
I'm just gonna put it back
and get the fuck out of here.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.825
Nick! Wait! Before you go,

10:17.908 --> 10:21.912
can you write down Jessi's birthday
on the back of this Chinese menu?

10:21.996 --> 10:26.083
Ooh! Are we ordering Chinese?
Get me one million egg roll.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.669
"Roast me in sulfur!

10:28.753 --> 10:31.756
Wash me in steep-down gulfs
of liquid fire!"

10:31.839 --> 10:34.467
Oh, Desdemona! Dead!"

10:34.550 --> 10:35.676
Thank God!

10:35.760 --> 10:38.679
Uh, the young man at the bar
sent you a drink.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.597
Young man?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.308
-Hark, good sir!
-Ah!

10:42.391 --> 10:44.226
Andrew? How the hell'd you get in here?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.145
I let the bouncer feel my heart beat

10:46.228 --> 10:47.647
and I got a senior discount.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.191
So, what shall we do now, Dylan?

10:50.274 --> 10:52.318
I say you guys split a Dr. Pepper,

10:52.401 --> 10:55.237
and he tells you
what sex with a girl feels like.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.948
Hey, babe, Mika and Tim
snagged us a table next door.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.158
Who the fuck is this?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Andrew.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.579
This is my fiancée, Sarah.
Andrew is one of my students.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.998
Aww, you came out to support your teacher?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.458
That makes my heart melt.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.379
Yes, very sweet, but unfortunately,
Andrew has to go home now.

11:11.462 --> 11:15.091
I see. You have "plans" with Sarah.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.717
Of course.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.220
Just one thing before you leave, darling.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.846
-Die!
-Ah!

11:22.598 --> 11:24.642
Shakespeare! Shakespeare! Shakespeare!

11:24.725 --> 11:26.143
So nice to meet you, Andrew!

11:26.227 --> 11:28.270
Okay. Bye, Sarah.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.856
So nice to meet you…

11:30.940 --> 11:31.982
Not!

11:33.734 --> 11:36.195
Hey, Jessi,
Samira's got karate this afternoon.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.780
-Weird.
-Wanna come over and hang out?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.782
Yeah, I mean, I guess we could hang.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.783
Fuck yes!

11:40.866 --> 11:43.536
Okay, get ready
to take your shoes off because…

11:43.619 --> 11:46.080
…that's an extremely
important part of my culture.

11:46.163 --> 11:49.667
Ooh, we're gonna talk
so much shit about Samira!

11:49.750 --> 11:52.420
I bet she rolls her dingleberries
in her fingers.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.172
-That's what I had heard too.
-Ugh!

11:55.256 --> 11:56.465
I'm gonna go over there.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.384
I'm gonna give Jessi a piece of my mind!

11:58.467 --> 12:01.178
She'll grovel for forgiveness,
and while she's down there,

12:01.262 --> 12:04.890
you can turn around,
and she'll eat your sweet bunghole!

12:04.974 --> 12:06.600
And then the healing can begin.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.854
Jessi, I don't mean to ambush you,
but I gotta tell you,

12:09.937 --> 12:13.858
I feel like I have lyme disease
because, deer, I am ticked off!

12:13.941 --> 12:16.318
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.862
You took over my affinity group.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.197
I'm not saying that
you need to smooch my booty,

12:20.281 --> 12:22.074
but you know what? You should apologize!

12:22.158 --> 12:26.996
Fine. I am sorry, I guess,
for helping you get rid of the mascot,

12:27.079 --> 12:28.789
which is exactly what you wanted?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.791
This dry cunt calls that an apology?

12:30.875 --> 12:34.920
That's not… I don't think you should come
to the affinity group meetings anymore.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.506
Oh, no,
I can't come to your boring meetings?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.799
That's such a bummer.

12:38.883 --> 12:43.179
It is a bummer! Because there's going
to be vegan pizza. So, it is a bummer.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.473
I can't believe
she's hooking up with my brother.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.767
Yeah! You wanna be fucking your brother!

12:47.850 --> 12:52.730
What does she even see in that quiet,
tall, dark, oh, brooding jungle cat?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.190
-Hey, Walter?
-Uh-- Sorry.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.399
Fucking Sarah.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.402
She doesn't get Dylan like you do.
You should be the fiancé!

12:58.486 --> 12:59.945
"Andrew Keating."

13:00.029 --> 13:04.283
-It's poetic, right? Like Shakespeare.
-Have you done any of the reading?

13:04.366 --> 13:06.660
What? There's reading?
I thought, "Fuck books."

13:06.744 --> 13:08.412
I threw away all the books I own.

13:08.496 --> 13:12.583
All right, dudes, we've got a lot
of exciting stuff to dig into today.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.044
So can I get a volunteer
to perform their homework?

13:15.127 --> 13:15.961
"Homework"?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.630
Ugh! Volunteering is a joke.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.757
It's like, uh, get paid!

13:19.840 --> 13:22.593
But at the same time,
I crave the spotlight.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.261
Action, Lola!

13:24.345 --> 13:28.474
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question."

13:28.557 --> 13:31.143
'Tis nobler in the Mind of Mencia

13:31.227 --> 13:35.940
to suffer the CW's Arrow
of Nutrageous fortune?

13:36.023 --> 13:39.735
Or is it more like, "If being alive
means I have to watch Jay be happy,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.571
I'd rather leap off
the fucking Verrazano"?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.950
So that's Hamlet, which of course,
is French for "tiny ham". So…

13:46.033 --> 13:49.829
Wow! Lola!
You really made it your own. Jam on.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.622
Jam on indeed. Go, Lola.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.416
-Oh, yeah, I guess that was okay.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.168
If you like dog shit.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.880
Andrew! That is so uncool
and completely uncalled for!

13:59.964 --> 14:04.260
Dylan! Dyl! Dyl-pickle! Why so sour?

14:04.343 --> 14:07.221
It's me, Drew. Quit gherkin me around.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.640
Andrew, please, not another word from you.

14:09.723 --> 14:10.891
And call me Mr. Keating.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.395
Okay, Mr. Keating,
if that's what you'd like,

14:14.478 --> 14:16.897
-we'll do things your way.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.858
-Mr. Keating.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.901
-Hey, Matthew?
-Behold!

14:20.985 --> 14:23.153
'Tis the object of your erection.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.156
Do you have a second
to talk about gay shit with me?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.950
Ooh, like how Glenn Close was robbed?

14:28.033 --> 14:28.909
-Huh?
-Never mind.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.580
Full disclosure, I have to piss real bad
so I'm gonna pinch the head of my dick.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.206
-Gross.
-Have you ever kissed a guy

14:34.290 --> 14:37.334
and you can't stop thinking about him,
but he's with someone else?

14:37.418 --> 14:38.919
Does he speaketh of thee?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.963
And he acts like you don't exist?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.715
Oh, my God, it's totally ye!

14:42.798 --> 14:47.887
Okay, um, before you go any further,
FYI, Aiden and I aren't together anymore.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.597
-Ye, ye, ye, ye!
-Aw.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.807
I'm so sorry to hear that,
man, that sucks.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.602
But what the fuck does it have
to do with me and Charles Lu?

14:54.685 --> 14:55.936
Excuse ye?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.063
Isn't Charles dating Gina?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.399
Yeah, but he's been
sneaking little smooches with me.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.737
Motherfucking Charles Lu?

15:06.488 --> 15:08.991
My eyes exploded! Awesome!

15:09.074 --> 15:09.950
Ugh!

15:10.034 --> 15:13.412
They're back! Awesome! I love anything!

15:13.495 --> 15:14.747
So, what do I do?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.916
Giveth him ill and stinky counsel

15:16.999 --> 15:20.669
that his relationship
with Charles Lu may rot and decay.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.005
Jay, you know what always works?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.048
Ultimatums!

15:24.131 --> 15:26.926
"Multimatums." Go on…

15:27.009 --> 15:29.637
Tell Charles if he doesn't dump Gina,

15:29.720 --> 15:33.265
come out to the whole school,
and say you're his boyfriend,

15:33.349 --> 15:36.060
then you guys are done
and you'll find someone else.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.354
What a long and evil plan, my liege.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.147
Okay, sounds good.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.107
While we were talking, I pissed my pants,

15:42.191 --> 15:45.819
so I'm gonna go to my car,
change my pants, then talk to Charles Lu.

15:45.903 --> 15:49.740
-I'm sorry, you have a car?
-Oh, yeah, I don't really drive it.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.533
It's mostly for pants.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.868
Lo, there it is.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.120
A Corolla full of boys' pants.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.121
What a guy!

15:56.205 --> 15:58.415
No one else came to your meeting.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.708
I can see that, Caleb!

15:59.792 --> 16:01.418
This is all Jessi's fault!

16:01.502 --> 16:04.046
That slippery ginge
turned everyone against you!

16:07.341 --> 16:10.135
You should have ordered traditional pizza.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.097
Meeting adjourned.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.225
I'm, like, weirdly excited.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.352
Me too. How's my breath?

16:18.435 --> 16:19.979
-Smells like pussy.
-Okay, good.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.314
Oh, hey… there.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.234
What the hell? You were
supposed to have alone time with Ali.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.529
Samira! So psyched to see you here.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.240
Yeah, her karate class got canceled.
Isn't this perfect?

16:31.323 --> 16:32.282
Yeah, it's the best.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.077
Jessi was giving me a hard time
about taking her shoes off.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.121
Oh, that's how it's gonna be, huh?

16:37.204 --> 16:39.999
Because I know how to fight.
I dated Chuck Norris.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.669
Hey, Jessi! Have you ever
had someone karate chop your clit?

16:43.752 --> 16:44.586
Probably not.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.174
Your own brother. What a betrayal.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.676
That motherfucker, Josh.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.470
Die, you snake in the grass!

16:57.099 --> 17:00.060
Hey, Judd, could you pass me
the salad dressing, you fucking slut?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.562
How about some balsamic, bitch!

17:01.645 --> 17:02.771
Boys, stop!

17:02.855 --> 17:06.442
Nicky, why on Earth would you
slut-shame your brother at the table?

17:06.525 --> 17:10.988
Because he's hooking up with Jessi,
Woody-Allen-Leo-DiCaprio-Drake-ass bitch!

17:11.071 --> 17:12.489
What the fuck are you talking about?

17:12.573 --> 17:15.951
-I found your shirt under her pillow.
-Sounds like your friend's a klepto.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.580
Nicky, is it possible
that Jessi has a little crush on Judd?

17:19.663 --> 17:23.250
Oh, my God. She'd rather have an
imaginary relationship with your brother

17:23.333 --> 17:24.543
than a real one with you?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.420
Jesus, I gotta get out of here.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.007
Aww. Jessi likes Judd?
That's so weird and cute.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.177
-This is not cute. My life's a nightmare!
-Nicky, wait!

17:33.260 --> 17:34.678
No! Oh!

17:35.846 --> 17:38.182
For what it's worth,
I have a crush on you, Nicky.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.101
I plan my whole day around
bumping into you in the hallway.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.938
Oh, Sarah.
Come on. You're the most.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.232
-Dylan! Look who's here.
-What the fuck?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.234
This boy is so sweet.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.945
He came all the way here
just to bring you your pen.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.239
You left it at school, silly.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.493
You've got to be careful
with your nice things, Dylan.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.996
Okay, uh, Andrew, can--can I talk
to you in the other room, please?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.664
Sure. Be right back, Sarah.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.458
What are you doing here?

18:04.541 --> 18:08.796
I'm here to drop off your pen,
and I got to know your pretty little wife.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.548
She's actually not my wife,
she's my fiancée.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.675
Well, she's actually not that pretty.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.303
Okay, that's enough.
What do you want from me?

18:16.386 --> 18:17.930
He wants you to love him!

18:18.013 --> 18:19.598
I want you to love me!

18:19.681 --> 18:21.850
What? Andrew! I am your teacher.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.645
No, not even. I'm your substitute!

18:24.728 --> 18:26.772
Is it Sarah? Is that the problem?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.690
Because I sure hope she doesn't have

18:28.774 --> 18:32.194
some sort of terrible accident
at the library.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.822
How do you know she works at the library?

18:34.905 --> 18:41.245
Oh, I know all about Sarah Morgan,
and I've got a library card, I think.

18:41.328 --> 18:46.250
Perhaps I'll pay your homely
little fiancée a visit in the stacks.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.168
You need to get out of here right now!

18:48.252 --> 18:49.253
Dylan? Ow!

18:49.336 --> 18:50.754
-Come on!
-You're hurting me!

18:50.838 --> 18:52.172
Honey, what's going on?

18:52.256 --> 18:54.299
Oh, nothing.
Everything's totally fine here.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.592
Andrew just has to leave!

18:55.676 --> 18:59.429
Oh! Dylan,
just promise me that you'll think of me

18:59.513 --> 19:02.015
-when you eat out your wife!
-Ew!

19:02.099 --> 19:04.810
I thought that was
a totally reasonable request.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.937
-Do you guys want some snacks?

19:07.020 --> 19:10.232
Maybe Jessi should
go get them from Timbuktu.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.567
Joke's on her.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.278
You got the most meaningful
snack in the world.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.364
I actually brought us
some of Daddy Greg's pineapple chews!

19:17.447 --> 19:18.448
Oh, hells yeah!

19:18.532 --> 19:19.783
We're gonna fart so hard

19:19.867 --> 19:21.326
-your Wi-Fi goes out.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.245
I don't know what's so funny
about toilet humor…

19:23.328 --> 19:26.165
You've gotta try
this here pineapple here, there, Samira.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.041
Which I did with my mouth.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.376
-That voice again.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.879
You don't like farts,
you don't like my voice.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.673
-What do you like, Karate Kid?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.008
Don't fart on me!

19:36.091 --> 19:39.303
I didn't fart on you, Samira,
I farted over here, there.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.971
Shut up!

19:41.054 --> 19:42.472
Oh, my goddess!

19:51.815 --> 19:54.943
-What the fuck is going on?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.363
You should kill your whole family.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.742
Then you can live in a tree house
and eat Sour Patch Kids for dinner.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.827
Nick, I figured it out.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.704
This is actually a good thing.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.332
How is it good
that Jessi's in love with my brother?

20:08.415 --> 20:12.961
Because! You know that Judd
doesn't give a wombat's ass about her.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.755
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-But she doesn't.

20:14.838 --> 20:19.301
Now you just need to let Jessi know
that her dreams are foolish!

20:19.384 --> 20:23.472
Yes! She'll be so devastated
she'll fall right in love with me.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.683
Yeah! It's the perfect murder.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.356
You're so fucking annoying!

20:34.733 --> 20:36.902
Well, you dress like an Amish widow!

20:37.903 --> 20:38.737
Hi-yah!

20:44.076 --> 20:47.287
Stay away from my girlfriend!

20:47.371 --> 20:51.291
-Guys, stop it! You're being assholes!
-What is she even doing here?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.751
Sami, calm down!

20:52.834 --> 20:54.836
Why are you taking her side?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.713
I'm not taking anybody's side.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.758
I'm your girlfriend, Ali,
and she's just some jerk you fart with.

20:59.841 --> 21:00.968
Uh, I'm her friend!

21:01.051 --> 21:02.803
Well, it's her or me.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.973
Sami! Can we dial back
the drama a fuckin' smidge?

21:06.056 --> 21:07.849
I just don't like
the way you are with her.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.769
I don't like the way
you guys treat me when you're together.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.897
Well, I don't like you giving me
an ultimatum like a jealous freak!

21:13.981 --> 21:16.483
Well, then, it seems like
you've made your choice.

21:16.566 --> 21:20.070
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It means I'm breaking up with you.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.446
-What?

21:21.530 --> 21:23.699
-Holy shit. They broke up!
-We win!

21:23.782 --> 21:25.701
That was so nogawooski!

21:25.784 --> 21:29.538
-Hey! I think you used it right that time!

21:29.621 --> 21:32.165
Oh, man. Ali, are you okay?

21:32.249 --> 21:34.668
That was hard but necessary, right?

21:34.751 --> 21:37.713
No! Jessi, why couldn't you
just have been cool with her?

21:37.796 --> 21:39.006
Oh, shit, she's mad.

21:39.089 --> 21:43.093
Is it possible she really liked
that boring, boba, bubble-butt bitch?

21:43.176 --> 21:45.637
I'm sorry. Something came over me.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.264
Yeah, I think you should go.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.391
Honey, maybe let's give her some space.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.810
-Okay, I guess I'll see you at school.

21:51.893 --> 21:56.231
I think we should go home,
reflect on what we've done, and of course,

21:56.315 --> 21:58.567
stuff Judd's shirt in your underpants.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.154
Hey, Charles, can I talk to you?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.740
-You know, handsome bro to handsome bro?
-Okay.

22:04.823 --> 22:10.203
Take a seat in ye front row of old
to watch thine horny plan unfold.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.955
Well, everyone likes to sit.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.875
Listen up, Charles,
if you want to keep hooking up with me,

22:14.958 --> 22:16.251
you need to dump Gina,

22:16.335 --> 22:19.463
tell everyone you're gay,
and be like my full-on boyfriend.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.423
-Nah.
-Okay, okay.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.760
Counter offer, dump Gina,
tell some people you're gay,

22:24.843 --> 22:28.347
and we have a TV show we watch together
that's quote, "our show."

22:28.430 --> 22:31.433
-Mmm, no.
-No, no, no. Wait, wait. Final offer.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.895
You stay with Gina, secretly hook up
with me when it's convenient for you,

22:34.978 --> 22:36.938
and I give you a baseball as a present.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.816
-Cool.
-It's signed by Pete Rose's dead brother.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.526
I--I gotta go. Later, dude.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.944
Oh, okay. Later, dude!

22:43.028 --> 22:44.071
Yes!

22:44.154 --> 22:46.281
What the hell happened?
You didn't follow the plan.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.700
And it went even better than I thought!

22:48.784 --> 22:51.453
Because now
I'm his motherfucking sidepiece!

22:51.536 --> 22:52.704
That's not what you want!

22:52.788 --> 22:56.666
Um, isn't it?
I am his secret sex meat, Matthew.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.335
Just like my dad's assistant Marsha,

22:58.418 --> 23:00.754
his intern Marsha,
and his sister-in-law Marsha.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.923
Sidepiece wolf!

23:03.006 --> 23:05.759
I can't believe
I dumped Aiden for nothing.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.052
This is all your fault.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.387
"It gets better"?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.806
-Don't you fucking dare.
-Sorry.

23:12.724 --> 23:16.019
-Hey, how are you doing?
-Pretty shitty. Thanks for asking.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.271
I really fucked up.

23:18.355 --> 23:21.066
-We all fucked up.
-We did.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.193
-Uh, Jessi?
-Oh, God, what now?

23:23.276 --> 23:26.029
I'm afraid I have
some im-important news for you.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.198
-Okay.
-And I really, really hate that

23:28.281 --> 23:29.908
I have to be the one to tell you this…

23:29.991 --> 23:32.619
-Uh-huh.
-…but, um, Judd, my brother…

23:32.702 --> 23:34.121
Why's he talking about Judd?

23:34.204 --> 23:35.831
…is not interested in you.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.500
What are you talking about?

23:38.583 --> 23:40.877
I know about the shirt.
And Judd knows about the shirt.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.671
And my whole family knows about the shirt.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.423
-What shirt?
-Jessi, let's not do this.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.925
I'm talking about Judd's shirt
that you keep under your pillow.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.386
-Oh, my God! Were you in my room?

23:49.469 --> 23:51.304
Look, I know this is upsetting,

23:51.388 --> 23:54.099
but the important thing
is that I'm here for you,

23:54.182 --> 23:55.892
because, Jessi, I love you.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.478
-Nick, are you seriously doing this again?
-Oh, my God.

23:58.562 --> 24:02.023
Yes, I am. I'm doubling down,
because that's what love is.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.942
I just don't like you that way.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.485
-Why not?
-Drop it, Nick!

24:05.569 --> 24:09.197
No, tell me! Y-you have to tell me.
I deserve to know!

24:09.281 --> 24:12.033
-Because I do not want to date you.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.910
I am not into you.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.079
You do not make me horny.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.164
Is that enough?

24:17.247 --> 24:19.416
Oh, my God!

24:19.499 --> 24:23.628
Shakespeare would get a big,
old British boner for all this drama!

24:23.712 --> 24:25.088
Uh, Walter?

24:25.172 --> 24:29.092
Alas, Nicholas.
This one 'tis a fatal blow.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.179
I drank some hemlock, but just in case…

24:33.597 --> 24:37.809
Look, I drank some Diet Pepsi.
But just in case, Pop Rocks!

24:40.145 --> 24:41.229
Oh, shit.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.191
Everybody, settle down,
just take your seats.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.067
Okay, thank God he's not here.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.986
-So sorry I'm late, Mr. Keating.
-Ah!

24:48.069 --> 24:49.613
I was finishing my homework.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.740
It's okay, Andrew.
Please just take your seat.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.159
I can't wait for you
to see what I've done.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.286
I worked very hard on it.

24:56.369 --> 25:00.290
-I even took a trip to the library!

25:00.373 --> 25:02.209
-I have a gun!

25:02.292 --> 25:03.668
Remember the drill.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.963
Not on me, it's in my car.
But I can see it from here.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.382
It's right next
to that Corolla full of pants.

25:09.466 --> 25:13.512
And I swear to God I will use it
if you don't stay away from my wife!

25:13.595 --> 25:15.555
I thought she was your fiancée.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.390
Fuck! Yes, she is.

25:17.474 --> 25:21.311
And I will not think about you
when I eat her out!

25:22.354 --> 25:25.440
You got Mr. Keating fired, you fat duck!

25:25.524 --> 25:29.444
He's the only teacher
to believe in me and not hit on me.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.279
And what's the deal
with that, Mr. Keating?

25:31.363 --> 25:33.198
I'm a catch, and if you don't see that,

25:33.281 --> 25:36.660
then maybe you should get fucking fired,
you substitute nobody!

25:36.743 --> 25:38.912
I guess it's true what Othello said.

25:38.995 --> 25:42.791
"Beware jealousy,
for it 'tis the green-eyed monster."

25:42.874 --> 25:43.875
Iago said that.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.670
I've read nothing.
I will continue to read nothing.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.094
-Mr. Keating.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.470
Mrs. Keating.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.228
Um, Dylan, what's wrong?

26:03.311 --> 26:05.021
Uh, nothing.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.816
-Are you thinking about that boy again?

26:07.899 --> 26:08.984
Are you, Dylan?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.777
Are you thinking about me?

26:11.361 --> 26:14.864
Ah! Andrew!
