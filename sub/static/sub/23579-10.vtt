WEBVTT

01:54.739 --> 01:57.534
-Oh, shit.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.833
Oh, shit. No, no. No.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.749
Oh, my God.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.960
Kristin.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.339
Kristin.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
Mama

03:00.597 --> 03:01.890
Mama, where are you?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.600
Kristin.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.438
-Kristin. Kristin...
-Mama. Mama. Mama.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.607
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.150
I promise, it's gonna be okay.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.735
-It's gonna be okay.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.652
What?

03:14.736 --> 03:15.945
He's behind you.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.037
You defy a god.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.706
<i>You defy a god.</i>

03:27.290 --> 03:28.917
<i>You defy a god.</i>

03:29.000 --> 03:31.294
Where are you

03:31.377 --> 03:32.712
Where are you?

03:33.880 --> 03:34.756
Come on!

03:34.964 --> 03:36.883
Punishment must fit the transgression.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.801
What do you mean, <i>pendejo?</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:55.068
This isn't real. This is a construct.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.945
Everything you've seen is real.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.989
They're all dead.
I recorded it for you to relive.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.327
-Quite a few. But we are far from done.

04:04.619 --> 04:08.081
I erase it and we start again.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.958
No. No. No.

04:11.542 --> 04:12.502
<i>No!</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:22.220
No.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.473
This is a construct.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.601
How many times have I done this?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.311
Not nearly enough.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.497
No. No.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.794
Let me out!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.338
Do you hear me?

04:59.340 --> 05:02.218
Can anyone hear me? Let me out!

05:03.970 --> 05:05.596
Let me out!

05:18.943 --> 05:19.944
Tak!

05:20.611 --> 05:23.531
There are no guns on this ship
except mine.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.076
Don't.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.202
Triggered against a stack,

05:28.286 --> 05:30.455
those batons have enough current
to cause mental damage.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.541
A few seconds longer, real death,
so I suggest you stay still.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.631
Shit.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.802
It's true.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.764
Damn Ava Elliot.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.558
It's all my idea.
She's doing what I asked.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.978
Don't think for a second
you haven't broken my heart by doing it.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.356
Do I sound the alarm?
Alert the ship's staff?

05:57.899 --> 05:58.775
No.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.486
We give his people no warning
he's been caught.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.570
Trace the satellite hack.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.449
If it came from that hotel,
I want that AI reduced to nanodust.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.867
Bring the others here.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.286
-Rei, just listen to me.
Why?

06:10.369 --> 06:12.080
You never listened to me.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.083
When you joined the Protectorate,
when the yakuza bought me,

06:15.166 --> 06:19.087
even when you said yes to the Envoys,
you made all the decisions.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.089
It ends here.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.643
The pulse blew out everything.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.521
It's not rebooting. I can't get a signal.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.482
-I know.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.025
Because I skipped over worry

06:41.109 --> 06:42.735
-and went straight to full-on panic.
-Huh.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.907
-Yeah. I burnt that bitch down.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.992
You should not have done that.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.756
Why didn't your sensors tell you
that I had come inside?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.767
Perhaps there's a malfunction
in your systems?

07:23.359 --> 07:24.360
What... is happening?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.492
Electron destabilizer.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.369
No.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.331
Miss Elizabeth?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.212
Ah.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.673
They're killing me in the real.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.592
You cannot stay here.
They will come for you.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.552
They were always coming.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.099
Give me your hand.
I'll send you onto the Array.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.601
-You'll be safe.
-No.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.522
-No time to argue.
-I'll go, but I don't run away anymore.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.025
I run toward.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.068
Send me up to the sky.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.112
-I cannot let you--
-I know the tree now,

08:08.196 --> 08:12.617
the branches spreading in every direction.
And I can see them all.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.161
AIs are easy to kill with the right tools.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.791
If you don't send me, they catch me.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.633
What is it that you see?

08:29.884 --> 08:30.885
Salvation.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.473
Death.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.313
Mickey!

08:43.606 --> 08:45.608
You shot him through the stack,
you son of a bitch!

08:46.526 --> 08:47.652
Retribution.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.532
Perhaps you could tell me
in what order

08:59.664 --> 09:01.290
It's time for you to send me away.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.334
-I can't.
-You can.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.418
You do.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.255
You already have.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.465
You gave me so much.

09:11.133 --> 09:15.054
Whatever it means to be human, Eddie...
you are.

09:16.180 --> 09:22.270
You don't deserve to be called human,
you despicable creature.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.691
And you are a dead machine walking.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.485
Mmm

09:29.860 --> 09:33.864
Then I will see you in hell.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.243
I'm sending your mind
to Head in the Clouds.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.705
Be careful, Lizzie.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.207
You shouldn't be afraid for me.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.960
You should be afraid for the monsters.

09:57.430 --> 10:01.684
"And neither the angels in heaven above,

10:02.977 --> 10:08.024
nor the demons down under the sea,

10:09.984 --> 10:16.866
<i>can ever dissever my soul</i>

10:18.492 --> 10:21.787
from the soul of the beautiful..."

10:34.508 --> 10:36.010
Whose stack is this? I should say "was."

10:41.307 --> 10:43.684
DHF is dark. No one's in here.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.405
Whoever this was,
you won't be seeing them again.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.658
Let's go.

11:24.683 --> 11:25.559
Hey!

11:27.478 --> 11:30.314
There's no one on the roster
to boot up in a synth tonight.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.525
You're not supposed to be in there.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.735
Let me guess.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.447
Your boyfriend wants you
in some premium silicone?

11:39.323 --> 11:40.533
Hmm?

11:44.578 --> 11:46.872
It's Braeman in engineering, isn't it?

11:47.456 --> 11:48.457
Yeah.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.794
I'm not gonna report you.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.007
I always wanted to try one of these out.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.689
Hey. I don't like that look.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.525
You act like you want it.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.196
Oh, honey, you don't like this model?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.000
I can be anyone you want.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.008
<i>♪ You can holler, you can wail</i>
<i>You can swing, you can flail ♪</i>

12:39.091 --> 12:42.344

<i>♪ If I ever give you up</i>

12:49.768 --> 12:51.729
No. Let me through!

12:51.812 --> 12:53.230
Tanaka!

12:53.689 --> 12:56.066
I need to talk to...
I need to talk to you.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.943
Can't go by here, ma'am.
-Please!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.321
This is a crime scene.
You've got no business here.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.948
Not with me. Not anymore.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.950
Because they still pay you?

13:06.911 --> 13:08.537
Still think you're better than me.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.206
Careful.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.167
Or what

13:13.792 --> 13:17.129
That's what you're worried about, right?
That you'll lose what you've got?

13:17.213 --> 13:20.090
Your safety, your job, your life.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.718
Let me tell you, Captain,
you already have.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.679
I think you're confusing me with yourself.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.808
I came here to try to do the right thing.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.020
Now, I know you have no reason
to trust me,

13:33.979 --> 13:38.359
but I believe you have a core of decency
and I am trying to find mine.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.070
Whatever you want from me...

13:44.156 --> 13:45.074
I can't.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.909
Get her out of here.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.329
I know where she is,
because I know who has her.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.040
All you have to do is ask me.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.833
Ask me where Ortega is.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.021
Hey. Hey. It's okay. Hey. Hey.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.525
-Hey.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.706
Kristin... Kristin...

14:33.789 --> 14:35.958
No!

14:36.959 --> 14:37.960
You bitch!

14:38.043 --> 14:40.129
-Let go of me!
-I'll do whatever you want.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.633
Good. Choose which one of them
gets their stack blown out.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.635
Or I'll have them all killed right now.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.847
-Don't do this.
I'm not going to.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.308
-You are.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.934
There's one bullet.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.394
One. Choose.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.734
This isn't about them. It's about us.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.277
You made it about them.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.447
It's time for you to evolve.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.033
Transformation is always painful.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.328
But I changed to make myself stronger.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.787
You can, too.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.082
All you have to do is pick one.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.469
<i>This is real power.</i>

15:28.552 --> 15:31.639
Cutting away the things
that make you weak one at a time.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.350
Embrace that power.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.227
Be on the winning side.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.192
Let 'em go...

15:44.693 --> 15:46.028
or you'll lose everything.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.990
Come back to me, Tak.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.876
Please...

16:02.503 --> 16:03.963
You won't do it.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.633
Wait. Please!

16:16.016 --> 16:18.560
You think I'd give you a loaded gun?

16:25.651 --> 16:28.028
You think you love her, don't you?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.614
I can't stand this fucking asshole.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.034
Right. You're hopelessly unavailable
and doomed to die.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.828
You really do have a type.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.206
-So I'll kill her first.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.582
Don't.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.501
Okay.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.880
Okay. I'll stay.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.511
It'll just be the two of us.
Just like it was.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.513
Just let 'em go.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.642
-It's a start.

17:00.769 --> 17:01.854
Take them away.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.911
I'm saving them for you.
You're gonna kill each one of them.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.332
And by the time you do,
you won't even care.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.095
<i>♪ You can holler, you can wail ♪</i>

17:35.179 --> 17:38.140
<i>♪ You can blow what's left</i>
<i>Of my right mind ♪</i>

17:40.601 --> 17:42.978
<i>♪ You can holler, you can wail ♪</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:45.814
<i>♪ You can blow what's left</i>
<i>Of my right mind ♪</i>

17:55.699 --> 17:58.911
<i>♪ After all, God can keep my soul... ♪</i>

18:00.788 --> 18:01.747
Who are you?

18:02.539 --> 18:04.416
I paid for this floor to be clear.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.881
I didn't dial for the S and M package.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.177
Although, maybe I'll just take it anyway.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.223
It's on the house.

18:19.306 --> 18:22.059
<i>♪ If there is a time</i>
<i>When the feeling's gone ♪</i>

18:22.392 --> 18:24.269
<i>♪ I wanna feel it ♪</i>

18:27.397 --> 18:30.901
I've done everything I can
to try and get you to understand.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.320
I've acted like the little girl
you miss so much.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.906
I'm out of patience.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.038
-Fight and your fireflies pay.
What are you doing?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.832
Taking out that wirecam.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.126
No one's ever gonna see that recording.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.753
And while we're at it,
let's get rid of that sleeve.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.713
-No.
I'm a Meth.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.340
We take what we want, when we want.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.842
Like the Ortega children?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.385
They were raw material.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.720
A means to an end
to get the respect I'm owed.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.307
They were kids. Just like we were.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.144
You think I wear this because I miss her?

19:06.395 --> 19:07.855
I don't miss her.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.231
I hate her.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.526
Mom was weak. She deserved to die.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.780
I keep this as a reminder
never to be like her.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.448
Rei-<i>chan...</i>

19:18.532 --> 19:22.828
Don't call me that.
I'm not that pathetic little girl anymore.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.873
I killed her...

19:26.874 --> 19:29.668
and became something stronger.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.136
Faster.
Can't go faster.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.597
-You fucking stabbed--
He's bleeding. Okay? He's hurt.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.808
All pain is instructional.
It warns you, "Don't do this."

19:44.892 --> 19:47.394
-Perhaps you should have listened.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.363
You're not authorized to be in this area.
Return to your room.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.381
Get to Kovacs! Go!

20:38.779 --> 20:40.239
Oh, my God.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.740
Lizzie?

20:46.328 --> 20:48.830
I'm gonna show you how much I love you.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.585
I'm sorry for all the times I failed you.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.797
I'm gonna eat you up.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.882
Hold him still.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.084
This ship, I'm going to kill it.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.961
All the systems
run through these terminals.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.879
She's gonna cut the main power
and the backups,

21:37.963 --> 21:40.215
and we have to throw all three relays
at the same moment.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.844
The Elliots are gonna bring
this fucker down.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.513
Flip the switches when I say.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.475
Ready Go.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.045
Kovacs!

22:18.128 --> 22:22.507
<i>Warning. This aircraft</i>
<i>has suffered a catastrophic power loss. </i>

22:22.591 --> 22:24.343
<i>Please evacuate.</i>

22:51.620 --> 22:52.954
No more dead children.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.998
Who's gonna stop me?

23:16.853 --> 23:22.275
<i>This aircraft will begin</i>
<i>to lose altitude in less than ten minutes.</i>

23:22.359 --> 23:24.653
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

24:14.077 --> 24:18.290
-Your mother prayed to God when she died.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.750
Where's your God now?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.712
You'll meet him soon enough, you bastard.

24:31.219 --> 24:34.055
I'll kill you before I let you put me
in a cage.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.571
-Everybody off this ship! Let's go. Move!
<i> <i>Warning.</i></i>

25:31.655 --> 25:33.365
<i>This aircraft will begin</i>
<i>to lose altitude...</i>

25:33.448 --> 25:35.825
-...<i>in five minutes.</i>

25:59.099 --> 26:01.309
Don't!

26:01.393 --> 26:03.103
He's mine.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.563
What are you doing?
You're bought and paid for.

26:05.981 --> 26:06.982
Not today.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.862
No, please.

26:14.823 --> 26:18.410
My mother prayed to God,
and he put you in my arms.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.869
Please.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.705
So tell me...

26:23.498 --> 26:25.583
are you a believer, motherfucker?

26:30.380 --> 26:31.214
Kovacs!

26:33.675 --> 26:35.176
-Kovacs!
-Reileen Kawahara!

26:35.260 --> 26:36.886
Open the door! BCPD!

26:36.970 --> 26:39.014
-You are under arrest!
Kovacs, can you hear me?

26:39.097 --> 26:41.224
Get back. Get back.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.559
They'll never get in.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.438
Then we stay here.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.234
We crash, but you'll still stand trial.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.278
I'm not going on ice.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.698
<i>Warning. This aircraft</i>
<i>will begin to lose altitude...</i>

26:58.950 --> 27:01.286
<i>...in three minutes.</i>

27:02.203 --> 27:03.079
Help me.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.916
We can make it out to the hull,
over to the escape pods.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.003
You might as well shoot me.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.214
Help me and I'll give you back Quell.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.135
What?

27:17.218 --> 27:19.971
I backed her up.
Right before the explosion.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.431
She didn't even know.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.687
It's the unanswered question.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.814
The mystery that needs to be solved.

27:34.694 --> 27:35.612
Where is she?

27:36.196 --> 27:39.783
Her DHF is hidden.
You'll never find her without me.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.619
You can have her back.

27:42.702 --> 27:46.539
Everything she knew, everything she was,
right up to the last moment.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.002
You saw me. You heard me.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.466
Because deep in your mind...

27:56.549 --> 27:57.550
I always knew.

27:59.552 --> 28:02.764
Help me escape and she's yours.

28:11.856 --> 28:12.857
I can't.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.695
You can't.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.784
Do what I say
or you'll never get her back.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.202
Never see her again.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.080
You've become everything
we fought against.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.613
Go on. Do it.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.451
I'll never stop.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.954
I'll never stop.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.175
-Kovacs!

29:22.177 --> 29:23.928
No. No. Kovacs!

29:25.263 --> 29:27.724
Kovacs, fucking answer me! Answer me!

29:29.100 --> 29:30.310
Kovacs?

29:33.188 --> 29:35.231
-Goodbye.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.234
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.235
Listen to me.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.905
Listen to me,
you've gotta get out of there.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.865
You've gotta get out of there.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.825
I'm staying with her.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.829
<i>This aircraft</i>
<i>will begin to lose altitude in</i>

29:49.913 --> 29:51.998

29:52.081 --> 29:54.209
Please, open the door. Please? Come on.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.129
Please just make it worth something.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.798
I'm not leaving without you.
Come on.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.049
Kristin, go!

30:01.883 --> 30:03.009
No!

30:03.092 --> 30:04.677
Come on.
-No!

30:16.815 --> 30:18.233
She was my sister...

30:20.276 --> 30:21.319
and I loved her.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.119
She lost her path.

30:31.746 --> 30:36.251
But in her own way, she loved you back.

30:50.807 --> 30:54.394
<i>Warning.</i>

31:44.569 --> 31:45.820
I'll stay, Tak.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.156
I'll always be with you.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.917
Tell me a story.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.588
Something that doesn't end
in death and tragedy.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.757
Long ago,

32:07.383 --> 32:08.843
and worlds away,

32:11.346 --> 32:13.181
there was a young princess,

32:14.015 --> 32:16.225
orphaned in a time of war.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.440
<i>She was called upon</i>
<i>to lead the armies of her kingdom,</i>

32:22.523 --> 32:23.650
<i>for there was no other.</i>

32:25.401 --> 32:27.862
<i>She was the fiercest of warriors,</i>

32:27.946 --> 32:31.199
<i>beloved of her people, </i>
<i>unstoppable on the field. </i>

32:33.701 --> 32:36.579
<i>She rode out every day </i>
<i>and saved her subjects</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:38.790
<i>in battle after battle.</i>

32:46.881 --> 32:49.842
<i>But every night,</i>
<i>when the fighting was done, </i>

32:50.385 --> 32:51.719
<i>she was alone.</i>

32:52.845 --> 32:57.266
<i>Until one day, a peasant boy came</i>
<i>looking to join her army. </i>

32:57.976 --> 33:01.229
<i>Lonely and angry and fierce as she.</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:02.939
<i>For the first time,</i>

33:03.022 --> 33:06.818
<i>she found that when she strode out</i>
<i>onto the field to save others,</i>

33:06.901 --> 33:11.572
<i>there was someone at her side </i>
<i>who had come to save her.</i>

33:12.657 --> 33:15.451
<i>Then there came </i>
<i>the darkest battle of the war.</i>

33:16.202 --> 33:19.872
<i>The princess and her peasant boy stood,</i>
<i>side by side,</i>

33:19.956 --> 33:24.877
<i>and vowed that they would be separated </i>
<i>by nothing less than death itself.</i>

33:25.378 --> 33:27.630
<i>She fell to an enemy sword...</i>

33:28.965 --> 33:31.300
<i>and died before his eyes.</i>

33:46.899 --> 33:51.029
<i>And those who heard the story cried</i>
<i>for the death of love.</i>

33:56.409 --> 33:59.495
This is an unusual situation, Mr. Kovacs.

33:59.996 --> 34:03.332
We were able to pull your stack
from the wreckage in the bay,

34:03.416 --> 34:05.585
but your sleeve was killed on impact.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.253
So that's why we're in virtual. That's part of what's unusual.

34:09.422 --> 34:12.717
Your counterpart has refused
to be debriefed in the real.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.345
Well, I've been on an island getting laid
and he crashed and died,

34:16.429 --> 34:19.891
so the least I could do was share
the same shitty virtual questioning.

34:19.974 --> 34:23.603
-It's a solidarity thing.
-That would be exactly the problem.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.607
Although there's a pardon
for Takeshi Kovacs,

34:27.690 --> 34:28.733
it's only for one of you.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.987
The UN has taken over
this investigation

34:33.071 --> 34:35.823
due to the sensitive nature
of what you've uncovered,

34:36.407 --> 34:40.119
and while we're grateful for the service
you've both done for the Protectorate

34:40.203 --> 34:42.205
in exposing this criminal activity...

34:42.288 --> 34:46.209
We can't allow two Kovacs DHFs
to survive. It's illegal.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.669
So one of us has gotta die.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.089
It'll be your decision.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.966
-Together.
-All right, let me talk to him.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.595
And I choose the construct.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.817
The look on her face.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.987
The look on her face
when I pulled the trigger.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.743
It was almost relief.

35:21.577 --> 35:25.039
Maybe she realized what she'd become.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.876
A way for her to let go.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.047
You saw her eyes.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.550
Could you tell?

35:38.427 --> 35:39.595
I don't know.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.144
And I don't think I ever will.

35:51.357 --> 35:54.569
We gotta decide whose memories to keep,
yours or mine.

35:55.736 --> 35:59.157
That's a funny way to ask
which one of us is gonna die.

35:59.907 --> 36:00.908
Play for it?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.495
Rock, paper, scissors?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.647
Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.693
Let perpetual light shine upon them.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.574
May their souls
and all the souls of the departed...

36:43.117 --> 36:44.660
through the mercy of God...

36:46.954 --> 36:48.372
rest in peace.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.920
-Amen.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.350
How?

37:09.393 --> 37:10.770
I was double-sleeved.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.189
One of us died.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.112
Which one are you?

37:20.696 --> 37:22.365
The one you said goodbye to.

37:36.045 --> 37:40.258
Mmm.
-It's beautiful, Miriam. Stunning.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.763
I can't believe that I am looking
at the fossil of an actual Elder.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.348
Mmm-hmm.

37:47.431 --> 37:51.560
It makes you wonder if memories
of Elder civilization

37:51.644 --> 37:54.313
are what gave us the idea for angels.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.440
<i>He slagged his own stack. </i>

37:57.108 --> 37:59.902
<i>He has an archaic streak.</i>
<i>You'd call it honor.</i>

37:59.986 --> 38:01.988
<i>The fool wanted to forget,</i>

38:02.071 --> 38:04.490
<i>as if that would make him clean </i>
<i>of what he'd done.</i>

38:05.491 --> 38:09.161
<i>Explosive allegations implicating</i>
<i>Laurens Bancroft, </i>

38:09.245 --> 38:12.331
<i>Meth mogul and one of the richest men </i>
<i>of the Settled Worlds,</i>

38:12.415 --> 38:14.500
<i>in murder and sleeve death.</i>

38:15.084 --> 38:18.754
<i>The crash last week of Head in the Clouds,</i>
<i>one of the Houses,</i>

38:18.838 --> 38:20.965
<i>is said to be related.</i>

38:21.048 --> 38:23.301
<i>It's alleged Bancroft killed himself </i>

38:23.384 --> 38:26.804
<i>in an attempt to escape feeling guilt</i>
<i>for his crime,</i>

38:26.887 --> 38:30.182
<i>but not until after</i>
<i>he illegally influenced</i>

38:30.266 --> 38:34.270
<i>the members of the UN Court</i>
<i>to defeat Resolution 653.</i>

38:35.229 --> 38:38.566
<i>Pressure is mounting in the court </i>
<i>to reconsider 653,</i>

38:38.649 --> 38:42.153
<i>which would allow victims </i>
<i>to testify against their killers,</i>

38:42.236 --> 38:45.698
<i>even if they have religious coding </i>
<i>on their stacks.</i>

38:49.702 --> 38:51.579
Laurens, whatever you've done...

38:53.080 --> 38:54.206
I'll stand by you.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.339
I...

39:03.007 --> 39:07.553
I may be many things,
but I am not a murderer.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.181
-Of course.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.726
Prescott didn't kill you.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.561
Get out.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.146
You were alone in this room.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.733
You weren't insane. Just a coward.

39:20.816 --> 39:21.734
No.

39:21.817 --> 39:25.112
No, I know who I am.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.699
And in essence, I am a decent man.

39:28.783 --> 39:32.453
You're about to be arrested
for the real death of Lena Rentang.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.663
I don't even know who that is.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.625
That's 'cause you blew out your own stack
to forget about her.

39:37.708 --> 39:42.380
So this criminal Kawahara woman
makes up a story and it gets on the feeds.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.589
No one will believe it.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.175
They'll believe Mary Lou Henchy.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.304
See, Reileen had her stack,
and they just pulled it out of the bay.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.683
As soon as 653 moves forward,
Mary Lou's gonna talk.

39:56.018 --> 40:00.356
I mean, even if you're right,
that I real death'd that girl...

40:00.439 --> 40:03.067
the person who did that is dead.
I destroyed him.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.444
You erased the memory, not the act.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.948
This cannot be the man I am.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.908
You lived too long.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.452
I believed...

40:15.871 --> 40:18.707
I believed I had a line I would not cross.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.546
I believed I had a conscience.

40:24.630 --> 40:27.216
To put a gun to your own head
when you want to live...

40:27.967 --> 40:29.552
that takes the will of a demon.

40:31.345 --> 40:35.099
You thought you were a god.
You're more like the devil himself.

40:36.809 --> 40:40.855
Sir, police are waiting downstairs.

41:15.389 --> 41:17.183
Look after the family, Isaac.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.852
I'll leave everything to you.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.938
As I should have done, a long time ago.

41:35.034 --> 41:39.288
I surrender myself
for the crimes I have committed.

41:39.371 --> 41:40.581
We're not done here.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.250
Right, Miriam?

41:45.002 --> 41:46.045
What?

41:46.837 --> 41:49.423
-I certainly have no idea.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.439
Say what you came to say.

42:09.902 --> 42:13.155
For the longest time,
I couldn't remember what happened to me.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.115
I couldn't even speak.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.576
But I can now.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.539
I got pregnant.

42:23.582 --> 42:26.585
I came up here to tell you,
but you weren't here.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.379
She was.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.549
-Whore.
-You watch what you say to my daughter!

42:31.632 --> 42:36.679
You hit me and you kicked me
and you kept kicking me.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.142
I remember it all.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.105
That's a lie.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.609
Oh, my God.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.403
I only wanted to talk to her.

42:53.028 --> 42:55.281
I offered her money.
I offered her anything she wanted,

42:55.364 --> 42:57.032
if she'd just get rid of it.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.077
I got angry.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.247
It was an accident.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.748
You took my baby from me!

43:06.000 --> 43:09.420
You had to have her stopped
from getting spun back up.

43:10.713 --> 43:15.426
You asked me to get you a fixer.
So I got you the best.

43:16.468 --> 43:19.054
So Reileen took her
to the Wei Clinic, drove her crazy,

43:19.138 --> 43:20.514
and dumped her in an alley.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.559
The cops didn't care
about another sleeve-dead hooker,

43:23.642 --> 43:25.561
so no one found out about the baby.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.896
Oh, for God's sake, Miriam.

43:29.481 --> 43:31.025
You don't understand.

43:31.942 --> 43:33.986
The children are all I have.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.281
The children are mine!

43:39.158 --> 43:43.746
But then Reileen wanted something back,
so she had you drug your husband.

43:46.749 --> 43:47.583
It was you?

43:49.418 --> 43:51.545
It was you who betrayed me?

43:51.629 --> 43:54.256
Don't you talk to me about betrayal.

43:58.802 --> 44:02.264
You did this to me.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.895
We have ruined each other.

44:08.604 --> 44:09.605
Haven't we?

44:16.362 --> 44:19.948
Miriam Bancroft, you're under arrest
for the sleeve death of Elizabeth Elliot

44:21.283 --> 44:24.578
and the forcible termination
of her pregnancy against her will.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.296
<i>Ava Elliot was pardoned. </i>

45:16.797 --> 45:20.426
<i>I paid off her sleeve mortgage,</i>
<i>and got her her real body back.</i>

45:21.760 --> 45:24.596
<i>Lizzie kept the synth.</i>

45:25.472 --> 45:30.144
<i>When anyone asks her why, she says, </i>
<i>"Because it's not real."</i>

45:30.853 --> 45:33.021
<i>And she doesn't know if she is, either.</i>

45:38.610 --> 45:43.031
<i>653 passed. </i>
<i>The dead could now accuse their murderers.</i>

45:43.740 --> 45:46.702
<i>The world changed. For all of us.</i>

45:46.785 --> 45:49.580
-There's nothing left to unpack.
Really?

45:49.663 --> 45:52.291
-We can't be done.

46:01.341 --> 46:03.594
Ryker?

46:04.761 --> 46:05.929
He's a lucky guy.

46:06.763 --> 46:10.559
You're the reason why he was cleared.
That's not luck.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.312
He was cleared 'cause he was innocent.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.274
He deserves to get his life back.

46:19.067 --> 46:20.235
Everything he lost.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.877
And after you turn Ryker's sleeve in...

46:38.670 --> 46:39.755
where will you go?

46:42.049 --> 46:43.050
I don't know.

46:44.259 --> 46:45.594
I don't know anything...

46:48.013 --> 46:49.765
except that she's still alive.

46:54.186 --> 46:56.021
Good luck, Takeshi Kovacs.

47:04.404 --> 47:06.073
<i>After his princess died,</i>

47:06.657 --> 47:08.742
<i>the peasant boy wandered the world...</i>

47:10.536 --> 47:12.746
<i>lost to despair.</i>

47:15.123 --> 47:19.336
<i>Until one day, he came upon an immortal</i>

47:20.170 --> 47:23.257
<i>who told him his princess </i>
<i>had been stolen,</i>

47:24.383 --> 47:26.426
<i>trapped in an enchantment.</i>

47:34.434 --> 47:38.230
<i>So now he seeks her, </i>
<i>across this world and every other. </i>

47:39.106 --> 47:40.566
<i>Because somewhere,</i>

47:40.649 --> 47:45.362
<i>sealed behind frozen glass </i>
<i>and thick walls of deadly thorns,</i>

47:45.445 --> 47:46.655
<i>she sleeps...</i>

47:48.073 --> 47:49.741
<i>waiting to be awakened.</i>

47:53.620 --> 48:00.419
<i>And someday, without fail, </i>
<i>he will find her.</i>
