How could you not know that?

00:07.925 --> 00:11.011
I was meeting her for the first time,
I didn't know what she looked like.

00:11.428 --> 00:16.183
We didn't care if it was going to be a boy
or a girl, but I'm so happy it's a boy.

00:16.266 --> 00:19.019
-They can be best friends.
-I love that.

00:19.102 --> 00:22.314
-Hey, buddy, say hi to your best friend.
-Yeah, here. High five.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.066
They're gonna high five.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.193
[ladies grunting]

00:26.318 --> 00:29.321
You know what we should do?
Family camping trips.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.908
Always wanted to be one of those families
that goes on camping trips with friends.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.036
We can get a little stove,
and we can cook gourmet meals.

00:36.119 --> 00:39.581
-Yes, I love this idea.
-It just sounds like so much work!

00:39.665 --> 00:42.084
What about hotels? I like hotels.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.503
-Baby Sam is going to love camping.
-Wait.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.631
-You guys picked a name?
-Samuel.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.717
We're naming him after Elsa's dad.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.845
-Should we tell you ours?
-Yes.

00:53.929 --> 00:54.930
Okay.

00:55.055 --> 01:00.102
-[exhales] His name is going to be...
-Arlo.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.981
-Arlo...
-Arlo!

01:04.064 --> 01:06.149
-Arlo is such a shitbag!
-Casey.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.527
-No, she's right. That kid is a shitbag.
-Yep!

01:08.610 --> 01:11.613
Shitbag or not-- It just does feel gross
to say that out loud.

01:11.697 --> 01:15.200
-I find it invigorating. "Shitbag."
-We have to handle this calmly.

01:15.284 --> 01:19.454
I am gonna calmly go over to his house
and bash his pea-head in with a shovel.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.957
[Sam] <i>It's always difficult to emerge</i>
<i>into the world.</i>

01:22.040 --> 01:24.918
This much is true: Somebody
has to kill that kid. Just a fact.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.379
I know you're being facetious,
but it's not helping.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.880
Could you all be quiet?

01:29.131 --> 01:30.924
[Sam] <i>That's why you need your family.</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:33.343
I'm trying to hear her first peeps.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.763
Well, I'm going to sit on you like an egg.

01:36.847 --> 01:40.058
-No. Do not sit on me like--
-Yep.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.854
Don't! Stop sitting on me like an egg.
I'm not an egg.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.939
[Casey chirping like a bird]

01:57.618 --> 01:58.702
Hi, Paige.

[students chattering]

02:01.913 --> 02:02.914
Samuel.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.086
How's your finger?
The one you cut off, I mean.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.755
I know which one you meant.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.215
And it's fine. Thank you.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.802
There's going to be a scar, but...

02:16.178 --> 02:19.348
what influential woman doesn't have
a story of pain in her past?

02:20.849 --> 02:21.767
Okay.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.271
Well, I wanted to say that I'm sorry,
and that I feel bad that I lied.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.566
I'm not actually doing lots of sex stuff
with other ladies.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.110
I'm not doing any sex stuff
with any ladies.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.654
I know.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.989
I did a deep dive on social media,

02:36.406 --> 02:38.367
but it's still nice to hear
from the horse's mouth.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.077
Is that an insult or a phrase?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.454
A phrase.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.623
I'll add it to the list.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.209
[unzips schoolbag]

02:48.460 --> 02:50.379
I got you this for your phone.

02:50.921 --> 02:54.257
I thought it would help you with typing,
since your finger's bandaged.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.179
[sighs] A stylus.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.932
Huh! Dammit, Sam.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.060
Yeah, I really wanted
to stay mad at you this time, but...

03:05.852 --> 03:06.895
fine!

03:07.396 --> 03:09.398
I accept and I also forgive you.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.526
-Okay, good.
-But I do have a favor to ask.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.195
You may or may not know this,
but I'm a sleepwalker.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.780
-I didn't know that.
-Oh, yeah.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.533
My mom says it's
because I have so much get-up-and-go

03:19.616 --> 03:22.035
that I can't stay still
even while I'm sleeping.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.622
One time I actually cleaned
both bathrooms fast asleep.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.667
But I'm a little bit worried
about the senior lock-in.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.338
The entire class spends the night
of graduation locked inside the school.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.716
I just... I need someone
to watch me while I sleep,

03:35.799 --> 03:38.301
so I don't end up...
wandering off somewhere.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.305
You want me to stay
somewhere else overnight?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.598
Yes.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.143
-You said no?
-Of course.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.938
It's a sleepover with, like, 100 girls.
They're basically begging you to bone.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.691
I didn't see anything
about boning on the flyer.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.861
Besides, even if I wanted to go,
I couldn't. In order to sleep,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.572
I need to be rolled up like a burrito
in my own bed.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.907
I feel that. Bunny likes his den,

04:00.991 --> 04:03.744
mousey likes his mouse hole,
booger like his nostril.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.829
But you're going to go to college
at some point

04:05.912 --> 04:08.457
and that's like 1,000 nights
away from home.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.876
First off, your math is off.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.128
It wouldn't be 1,000 nights.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.131
It would be roughly 180 days a year,
which equals...

04:16.214 --> 04:18.759
-720 days.
-Okay. All I'm trying to say is,

04:18.842 --> 04:21.136
it might be good to practice
sleeping somewhere else.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.139
-Like a practice expedition?
-Indeed.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.517
Hey, crash at my place.
My roommates are the dopest.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.937
And if you get overwhelmed, I'll just
drive you home. No sweat off my balls.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.524
-Why are you changing your shoes?
-These are my poop shoes.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.818
That way no one knows it's me
in the bathroom,

04:36.902 --> 04:38.737
'cause they don't see my shoes
under the stall.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.741
-Those look like Bob's shoes.
-Exactly. Always thinking.

04:42.824 --> 04:43.867
See ya.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.497
[machine buzzing]

04:48.914 --> 04:49.873
Gosh.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.169
We haven't used that thing in years,
I'm surprised it still inflates.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.465
You know, you really don't need
to sleep out here. It's drafty, right?

04:58.757 --> 05:00.550
I mean, I'm fine sleeping on the couch.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.428
No, it's okay. I like having the space.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.263
Well, in that case...

05:06.807 --> 05:08.016
sun room care package.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.521
Blankets, because the ones you grabbed
are scratchy.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.526
Space heater, for heat and white noise.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.322
Eye mask, so in the morning,
if it's too bright...

05:22.447 --> 05:24.908
and a night light
in case at night, it's too dark.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.953
Elsa, I'm a grown man.
I don't need a night light.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.747
Okay. Okeydoke.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.378
So, I just got off the phone
with Holly Sykes,

05:36.461 --> 05:40.257
and I'm going to go over there and talk
about what happened between Arlo and Sam.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.550
Well, why you?

05:41.883 --> 05:43.426
-What?
-Why you?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.680
I can advocate for Sam. I've been doing it
the entire time you've been gone.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.807
Okay, so...

05:48.890 --> 05:50.350
you want to go talk to them?

05:50.433 --> 05:51.893
It makes more sense.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.311
I'm still friends with Theo,

05:53.395 --> 05:55.981
you haven't been close to Holly
in what, ten years?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.399
Twelve and a half.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.025
Exactly.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.653
Okay, you're right.
We'll both go, we're both his parents.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.697
Fine.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.615
Okay.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.327
I am going to leave the night light,
just in case.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.497

He's such a dick!

06:44.988 --> 06:47.365
He was yelling and throwing things...

06:47.908 --> 06:49.284
and I was like, "Dude, leave!"

06:50.744 --> 06:53.663
But whatever.
I'm not scared of that asshole.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.000
-What about the kids?
-I took them to my grandma's.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.712
-But she doesn't have a lot of room, so...
-Oh, you're staying here.

-Izzie, this is Sam.
-No time. I'm busy.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.433
Seems like he likes you.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.646
What are you doing?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.774
-I'm packing my things.
-Why? You don't go places.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.610
I'm going to sleep over at Zahid's
to learn how to do it,

07:23.693 --> 07:27.697
for when I go to the senior lock-in,
and college, and eventually Bonetown.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.159
You know, that actually sounds like
a not-terrible idea.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.369
I thought so too.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.371
I think I have everything.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.666
-Edison. Should I bring Edison?
-No, leave the turtle.

07:41.044 --> 07:41.878
But...

07:43.088 --> 07:44.297
I need Edison.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.134
What if I can't sleep without the sounds
of his little feet on the glass,

07:48.218 --> 07:51.262
or the smell of his food
wafting through the tank vent?

07:51.513 --> 07:53.723
Maybe this is a bad idea.
Maybe I shouldn't go.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.351
-Sam--
-Why don't you leave Edison here,

07:56.434 --> 07:59.187
where he's comfortable?
But bring his container of food,

07:59.270 --> 08:02.190
so that way if you miss him
or you feel nervous you can just smell it.

08:03.358 --> 08:07.529
Olfactory senses are the greatest memory
stimulant of all the senses.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.739
That's not a bad idea.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.409
-Your name is Izzie?
-Yeah.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.743
Hm.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.848
Is this your room?

08:39.227 --> 08:41.730
I wonder if they've done
anything new to the house?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.816
Well, Theo told me
they built out the master bath.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.110
Nice.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.572
Do me a favor and just...

please don't bring up
whatever it was that happened.

Whatever it was that happened?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.038
You know what happened.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.458
They didn't invite us to a party
or something, right?

09:01.541 --> 09:02.584
No.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.378
I can't believe you don't remember.

09:05.462 --> 09:09.257
They took my idea
of a family camping trip,

09:09.340 --> 09:11.092
and then they excluded us.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.927
We went a few times, right?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.847
Yeah. And then when Sam got too difficult,

09:15.930 --> 09:18.933
they stopped inviting us
and started inviting other families.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.895
But he hated it. We probably
would have stopped going anyway.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.231
Yeah, that's not the point.
It should have been our decision.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.610
Just seems like a...

09:30.028 --> 09:31.863
pretty lame reason to end a friendship.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.075
Well, you were pretty on board
at the time.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.326
No, I wasn't.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.788
I just let you make all the decisions.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.542
[Sam] <i>Penguin chicks typically require</i>
<i>attentive parents for survival,</i>

09:44.626 --> 09:46.044
<i>but in some species,</i>

09:46.127 --> 09:48.880
<i>partially grown chicks will gather</i>
<i>in groups called crèches...</i>

-Sam, meet the roommates.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.140
We are his parents.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.851
But, we live together,
so technically we're...

10:01.935 --> 10:04.145
...being taken advantage of
by our own son.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.396
Your words cut deep, woman.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.483
-Call me <i>Umi </i>or start paying rent.
-I'll get the food, <i>Umi.</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:11.361
Sam, we are so excited you are here.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.446
-Yes.
-We heard so much about you.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.365
You have really helped our boy.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.494
Since he met you, he is sweeter,
more conscientious.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.955
Well, Zahid's the one that helps me.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.040
Your son is the wisest person I know.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.417
-Wise?
-A wise-ass, maybe.

10:26.501 --> 10:30.713
I mean, he certainly has potential,
but he has never been really focused.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.424
Well, he's very focused
when it comes to girls.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.678
It doesn't matter what he's doing,
if a hot girl walks in the store

10:36.761 --> 10:39.973
-he'll completely abandon his work--
-Okay, let's eat. Let's eat.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.432
I hope you don't mind, Sam,

10:41.516 --> 10:44.561
but I called your mom
to see what your favorite meal is.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.605
-Oh, God, that's hot.
-Butter noodles?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.566
We're all excited you're sleeping over.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.986
It's so impressive
that you're practicing for college.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.322
-I wish Zahid had gone to college.
-Okay, enough about that.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.576
-How are the butter noodles?
-The second best I've ever had.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.869
Oh, thank you.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.331
-[chuckles] Gardners.
-Hey.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.916
Come in, please.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.002
-So good to--
-Oh, you too.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.170
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:12.714 --> 11:17.260
Can I get anyone a beverage?
White wine... dark beer.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.179
-Yep.
-I remember.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.765
-Why don't-- Come in, sit down.
-Yes.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.894
Oh, new fireplace, huh?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.520
Just new stones.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.646
Pretty.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.899
Okay.

11:35.570 --> 11:41.743
-First... we want to apologize.
-We are so... sorry and feel so...

11:41.826 --> 11:46.289
awful and embarrassed
about how Arlo acted.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.875
Here's a check for Sam.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.337
And we got him a new phone.

11:52.921 --> 11:53.755
Oh, wow.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.216
This is not necessary.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.844
Sam, he just replaced the screen
at Techtropolis for free.

11:59.928 --> 12:03.264
-Keep it, really.
-We just... we feel awful.

12:03.932 --> 12:07.769
You know how...
Arlo's always had behavioral issues,

12:07.852 --> 12:09.646
ever since he was little.

12:10.146 --> 12:15.443
We... we took him to therapy
a few years back, but it didn't help.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.820
We spoiled him, that's what it is.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.323
[dog barking faintly in distance]

12:23.159 --> 12:25.161
I'm just going to go ahead and say it...

12:25.536 --> 12:26.788
we miss you guys.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.209
And us not being friends is just stupid.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.294
[chuckles]

12:33.419 --> 12:36.839
[Casey] "And this was so exquisitely
stupid, he didn't dare tell anyone

12:36.923 --> 12:39.259
that while he was feeling
for the light switch,

12:39.342 --> 12:42.053
some horrible, clawed paw

12:42.136 --> 12:45.515
-would settle lightly over his wrist--"
-Okay, stop.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.976
I can't do it. No, keep reading.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.311
-No, I'm stopping. It's too scary.
-[both laughing]

12:52.355 --> 12:54.941
Thank you for building
this ridiculous fort,

12:55.024 --> 12:56.276
and reading me scary books

12:56.359 --> 12:58.152
just to keep my mind off
of what's going on.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.320
Yeah.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.156
We can stay in here forever if you want.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.159
We can pee in the can,
do college classes online.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.160
-We can...
-Oh, yeah?

13:06.244 --> 13:07.996
...you know, get old here and...

13:08.079 --> 13:09.455
get a couple cats.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.498
[chuckles]

13:10.581 --> 13:12.625
-Newton?
-Yeah.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.711
This might sound lame, but...

13:16.629 --> 13:18.798
you're, like, my new favorite person.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.592
Really?

13:22.593 --> 13:23.720
Yeah. [chuckles]

13:24.387 --> 13:27.473
Is that tragic since we just met
a little while ago?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.267
No.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.437
You're my new favorite person, too.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.482
But don't tell Sharice
'cause she will kill you.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.234
Got it.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.445
[both laughing]

13:42.030 --> 13:44.032
Welcome to the dragon's lair, homie.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.992
I did my best to soundproof the digs.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.495
For example, put a cover on that mattress,
so it doesn't make sound in the night.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.498
And I borrowed that fancy smell-maker
from my roommate--

13:52.582 --> 13:54.208
-Your mom?
-My roommate...

13:54.417 --> 13:57.337
to make the room smell nice.
I figured you'd like eucalyptus.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.547
Like koalas. Yes.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.133
Yeah. Last but not least, lighting.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.928
Feel the bromance.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.682
My roommates sold my lava lamp
on Craigslist, so this will have to do.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.021
[cat statue ticks]

15:14.580 --> 15:17.375
Wow, that's a lot of trophies.

15:17.458 --> 15:21.212
Yeah, it's silly to put them all up,
but I think Arlo's proud of them.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.673
-So...
-No, I'm sure he is.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.178
So does Sam play sports or...?

15:29.303 --> 15:32.598
No, he's much more into art and biology.

15:32.682 --> 15:33.891
Oh, a smartypants.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.852
Yeah, he is.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.729
In fact, tonight he's having
his first sleepover ever.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.440
I mean, it's a little...

15:40.648 --> 15:43.734
late, but you know,
we're just so proud of him.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.699
Hey, I see the camping trips
are still going strong.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.036
It was a shitty thing to do.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.038
What?

15:56.122 --> 15:58.958
We never should have stopped
inviting you on those trips.

15:59.041 --> 16:04.046
I felt bad about it, forever,
and I just didn't know how to...

16:05.131 --> 16:07.133
It just felt like too much time had...

16:07.425 --> 16:08.718
[sighs]

16:09.886 --> 16:11.429
Anyway, I'm sorry.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.724
It's okay.

16:15.057 --> 16:15.933
Yeah?

16:16.517 --> 16:17.351
Yeah.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.898
-They seem to be getting along.
-Good.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.233
This thing has gone on long enough.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.569
I mean, who cares
about a silly camping trip

16:26.652 --> 16:28.321
that happened over ten years ago?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.490
Exactly. And you know, to be honest,

16:30.573 --> 16:34.118
it makes sense Holly and the kids
didn't want to hang around Sam.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.329
I mean, he was a little off back then.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.581
What?

16:39.081 --> 16:42.376
You know, always yelling
and making a scene.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.003
He was hard to deal with.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.590
Never mind, it's all good.
How about another drink?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.680
[women yelling on TV show]

16:58.226 --> 16:59.227
[glass breaks]

17:00.811 --> 17:04.023
Did I leave that on? Sorry, Sammy.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.983
[ticking]

17:06.150 --> 17:07.235

[Police officer] Hey!

-Sam. Sam!
-Whoa, hey!

17:47.108 --> 17:49.527
-It's okay, he has autism.
-You need to step back.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.946
-You don't get it, it's--
-I said get on the ground.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.671
I forgot I texted Nate.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.881
-No.
-Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.717
He's going to ruin the girl time.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.968
Let's pretend we're not here.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.347
We're not home.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.890
Open the door, you dummies.

[both chuckle]

18:21.350 --> 18:24.687

for making this fort. Oh, my God.

Well, boys ruin everything.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.358
Okay, what do we do?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.320
-Invite him in, I guess.
-We can watch a movie.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.572
-You'll fall asleep.
-No, I won't.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.452
Every time.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.332
So, how are things with the boyfriend?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.375
The boyfriend?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.377
You know his name.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.464
I'm sorry. How are things with <i>Evan?</i>

18:51.547 --> 18:53.799
Why are you saying it
like it's a fake name, weirdo?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.176
[Nate chuckles]

18:55.259 --> 18:58.763
I don't know, 'cause I'm suspicious of him
'cause I'm protective of you.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.224
That's nice. And unnecessary.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.061
-And sort of sexist.
-Thank you.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.232
But yeah, I don't know. Things are weird.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.945
Well, we're here,
if you need someone to talk to.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.448
Or, I'm here.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.076
Clearly, this one can't make it past 9:30.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.161
[Casey laughs]

19:22.328 --> 19:24.038
You guys are awesome.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.458
Thank you for being my first friend
at Clayton.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.463
What are you--

19:32.546 --> 19:35.341
-What are you doing?
-Come on, there's something between us.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.510
Friendship! You're my friend's boyfriend.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.429
I know, but you can't blame me
for being a little confused.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.558
Let me clear this up for you.
This is <i>never</i> going to happen.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.852
Now, leave.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.021
Go.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.774
Fine, make it weird.

20:01.575 --> 20:06.831
[Sam] ...Chinstrap, Emperor, Gentoo,
Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor, Gentoo...

20:06.914 --> 20:08.040
You alright?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.627
Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor, Gentoo...

20:11.877 --> 20:14.171
Hey, I have an idea.
Turn your chair around.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.506
-[phone ringing]
-[chattering]

20:15.631 --> 20:16.924
-What?
-Come on.

20:25.808 --> 20:26.976
[Zahid exhales]

20:28.060 --> 20:29.019
Feeling better?

20:32.064 --> 20:32.898
Look...

20:33.941 --> 20:37.486
you can't let one little setback
bring you down, man.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.989
Everybody has setbacks. Even me.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.826
I didn't always want to be in tech retail.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.204
-But you're so good at it.
-No doubt. I'm great.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.750
But... when I was a kid...

20:51.041 --> 20:56.088
my grandma got sick and we spent
a lot of time in the hospital.

20:56.172 --> 21:01.051
And frankly, the doctors were pricks,
but I thought the nurses were really cool.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.554
In my head,
they did all the important stuff.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.682
So I decided I wanted to be a nurse.

21:07.975 --> 21:08.893
A nurse?

21:10.436 --> 21:13.689
I'm good with people
and it seems like you learn cool stuff.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.025
It's, like, 99% chicks.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.235
But then...

21:22.531 --> 21:25.159
What? Are you going
to finish your sentence?

21:26.786 --> 21:31.832
Well, then I had Mr. Jeffries,
my high school biology teacher.

21:31.916 --> 21:35.544
Dude was like 88 years old, such a jerk,
and smoked like a chimney.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.756
-I mean, who smokes at work?
-You do, you smoke weed.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.635
That is very different, Samuel.
And shh! We're still at a police station.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.261
Sorry.

21:45.888 --> 21:50.768
Anyway, one day,
Mr. Jeffries got annoyed at me for...

21:51.143 --> 21:54.939
I don't remember what. I was probably
just being hilarious as usual.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.317
And he told me that I was a loser.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.695
And that I would end up a stoned nobody,

22:01.779 --> 22:04.490
working a dead-end job
for the rest of my life.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.910
Someone was mean to you?

22:09.203 --> 22:12.039
The words just... stuck in my brain,

22:12.122 --> 22:16.710
and every time I thought about applying
to nursing school, I'd just...

22:17.753 --> 22:19.129
imagine failing.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.550
Anyway, don't make the same mistake I did.

22:22.967 --> 22:26.262
I mean, life's going to be full
of a lot of little setbacks,

22:26.512 --> 22:28.180
but that doesn't mean you stop trying.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.895
You know, if Mr. Jeffries was 88,

22:34.979 --> 22:39.441
and smoked like a chimney,
statistically, he's probably dead.

22:39.942 --> 22:40.776
Does that help?

22:42.111 --> 22:44.572
-It really does.
-Good.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.699
It really does.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.201
Oh, my gosh.

22:49.285 --> 22:54.164
I think I borrowed this blouse, like,
15 years ago, and I never returned it.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.332
[both laughing]

22:55.416 --> 22:58.961
-Well, consider it a gift.
-Okay, thank you very much.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.631
Sure. You don't happen to have four
of our TV remotes, do you?

23:02.715 --> 23:03.799
[both laughing]

23:03.883 --> 23:07.970
Hey, try this Macallan, aged 30 years.
Figured you would appreciate that.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.348
[clears throat]

23:11.432 --> 23:15.269
You know... Sam has been through a lot.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.646
-We don't need to talk about all that.
-No, I...

23:18.606 --> 23:19.481
I think we do.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.444
You know, he has autism,
that's a real thing.

23:23.944 --> 23:29.116
I don't think it's something that he,
or we, deserve to be punished for.

23:29.199 --> 23:32.036
Dude, just try to get
to where we're coming from.

23:32.119 --> 23:36.373
Am I supposed to force my kids to hang out
with someone who yells and hits them?

23:36.540 --> 23:37.917
That would be punishing us.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.920
So, what are you saying?
Hanging out with Sam is like a punishment?

23:41.003 --> 23:42.713
I'm just trying to be honest, man.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.592
Maybe if you had exposed your children
to different types of kids,

23:46.675 --> 23:49.845
you wouldn't have raised Arlo
to be an insensitive jerk.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.848
-Whoa.
-Oh, I'm just trying to be honest, man.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.974
Theo, drop it.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.518
Me? I'm not the one
insulting people's kids.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.647
You're just saying mine isn't
neurotypical enough to hang out with.

23:59.730 --> 24:03.150
-Maybe we should--
-Yeah. No, let's go. Let's go.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.403
[whispers] I'm sorry.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.699
[Zahid]
That's the ninth nurse I asked out.

24:10.783 --> 24:14.620
-[Sam] Did she say yes?
-She did say... no.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.080
You two.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.625
I ran your IDs
and I'm going to let you go.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.544
Just don't go wandering around
at night looking like an addict.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.423
Dude, he has autism.
What went down, that is on you.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.510
You know, you charged an officer.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.387
So I wouldn't press my luck.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.847
Loud and clear. Let's go, Sam.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.563
Sam, look.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.357
It's 12:07 a.m.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.694
You stayed somewhere overnight.

24:46.777 --> 24:50.072
I mean, technically, you didn't sleep,
but it's a first step, right?

24:58.414 --> 25:00.416
That fireplace was pretty nice.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.794
-Listen, I'm sorry.
-Hey, no need to apologize.

25:03.877 --> 25:07.006
No, I should have let you go
over there on your own.

25:07.089 --> 25:10.968
I'm lying.
I thought the fireplace looked tacky.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.684
It must have been...

25:20.811 --> 25:22.646
hard for you back then, huh?

25:23.313 --> 25:24.857
Losing her as a friend?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.942
It was awful.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.695
I was really lonely.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.156
I cried.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.868
-You did?
-Yeah.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.453
A lot.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.622
It was kinda like a breakup.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.293
I'm sorry.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.674
Hey.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.553
What you did tonight,
what you said to Theo...

25:54.928 --> 25:56.430
That was really brave.

25:56.513 --> 26:01.060
No, you are definitely way better
at dealing with stuff like that than I am.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.688
I don't know. I thought you were great.

26:05.147 --> 26:09.026
In fact, I thought you were so great
that you deserve a trophy.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.074
Is that-- Did...

26:16.116 --> 26:18.118
Did you steal a child's trophy?

26:18.202 --> 26:21.080
Yes, I did. I stole a child's trophy.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.165
[both laughing]

26:24.833 --> 26:26.210
You're crazy.
