00:13.790 --> 00:15.300
She-bang!

00:15.800 --> 00:17.600
That's pretty cool,rit?

00:18.160 --> 00:19.020
Mm-hmm.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.010
That doesn't happen              very often,you know.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.230
I know.

00:26.650 --> 00:28.290
You won.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.080
You beat me!

00:30.240 --> 00:31.510
Uh-huh.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.300
You want to play again?

00:39.980 --> 00:41.440
(sighing):                           Fine.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.000
Whatever.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.840
Knock urself out.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.170
Evan?

02:47.780 --> 02:49.360
How long have you been here?

02:49.510 --> 02:51.040
About six hours.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.880
Why haven't these bodies                been released?

03:09.030 --> 03:10.410
Good question.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.940
David was in Henderson            another call,

03:13.090 --> 03:15.670
so,when Greg and I got here,

03:15.820 --> 03:18.380
we just started processing               the house.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.430
Found the victim                 in the bathroom,coverewith a towel.

03:20.580 --> 03:23.610
We got a plastic print           on the bathroom door.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.000
It's the strongest piece of      evidence-- I photographed it

03:26.150 --> 03:27.820
and transmitted the image        back to the lab;

03:27.980 --> 03:30.740
Mandy got a hit               to an unknown palm;

03:30.890 --> 03:32.910
case info was in ViCAP.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.410
And then,Dispatch called,

03:35.560 --> 03:37.740
telling me              to stop processing immediately,

03:37.870 --> 03:39.670
by order othe FBI.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.210
The FBI field office         is right next  the Strip.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.680
What's taking them so ng?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.320
Oh,beats the hell out of me.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.570
Jack Male,FBI.

04:14.730 --> 04:15.820
Jim Brass.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.029
I'm based in New York,

04:17.180 --> 04:19.940
but I was testifyi               in a case in S Francisco.

04:20.350 --> 04:21.750
When I heard about               the ViCAP hit,

04:21.899 --> 04:23.230
I got here                       as fast as I could

04:23.380 --> 04:25.450
Chopper from the Strip?              Th's nice.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.520
Th's my tax dollars                      atork?

04:28.010 --> 04:29.500
You get a positive ID                  the boy?

04:29.650 --> 04:32.290
No,but we have an               ID on the fele--             name is Carmen Davis.

04:32.430 --> 04:33.770
cording to neighbo,she lives alone.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.050
Apparently no kids               of her own.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.300
But if I find                    anythi out,

04:36.460 --> 04:39.270
I'll letou know.        Thank you. You'rup.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.320
You-- you t enough photos?

04:44.480 --> 04:45.700
Denitely.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.280
Roll the body over.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.190
What's going on?

05:05.180 --> 05:08.040
Jack Malone,FBI,New York City.

05:09.660 --> 05:10.690
This boy was kidnapped

05:10.840 --> 05:13.240
from his babysitter's           apartment six years ago.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.910
Babysitter was killed.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.710
The only evidence athe crime     scene was a bloody palm print.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.730
Well,there may be                  a resemblanc

05:19.890 --> 05:22.290
but kids change a lot                in six years.

05:22.510 --> 05:23.340
JACK:                            Mm-hmm.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.500
GRISSOM:                         DNA will tell us                 if this is your kid.

05:26.650 --> 05:29.380
But it does look like        your killer came to Vegas.

《犯罪现场调查》 第八季第6集

06:03.180 --> 06:04.960
????

06:05.100 --> 06:07.440
TOD-- roughly 24 hours ago.

06:07.590 --> 06:10.300
And he's got perimortem bruising  on the back of the neck.

06:10.450 --> 06:14.080
And a sing sharp-fce              injury to e forehead.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.940
Looks like he hit his head               on the table.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.760
Or somebodslammed it              against the table.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.660
Well,we don know <i>that</i> yet.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.330
Agent Malone,why don't I fill you in

06:28.480 --> 06:29.900
on what se                       weo know.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.530
There are no signs anywhere that  the boy actually lived here.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.700
The sleeping bag                on the couch indicates

06:34.860 --> 06:37.750
that he was probably                a house guest.

06:38.470 --> 06:40.840
Why don'you foll me                  into the kitchen.

06:41.230 --> 06:43.110
t me know when you're ready         to transport theody.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.730
PHILLIPS:                        Yes,ir.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.450
WILLOWS:                 Bring usp to spe,Greg.

07:06.610 --> 07:08.320
Okay,sure. Um...

07:08.470 --> 07:10.700
Carmenavis's keys            were still in her purse;

07:10.850 --> 07:12.080
the car'outside.

07:12.230 --> 07:15.120
No cash in the wallet,and the   credit cards have been removed

07:15.270 --> 07:17.500
and neat stacked on the table;        it appea as though

07:17.640 --> 07:19.010
they've been wed clean.

07:19.170 --> 07:20.150
The killer w smart eugh

07:20.290 --> 07:22.670
not to take anything             that could be traced.

07:22.830 --> 07:25.590
Which suggts that           he was an experienced criminal.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.680
What do you know                  about this guy

07:27.830 --> 07:29.970
Including everything             you just told me?

07:30.460 --> 07:32.580
Everything you just told me.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.800
Six years ago,the killer took   the murder weapowith him.

07:36.970 --> 07:39.690
It was a baseball bat that       he found in the apartment.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.910
Well,this time,we think it's a hammer.

07:43.270 --> 07:47.900
The round indentation wounds are consiste with haer blows.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.980
Do you see any similarities      between this victim

07:51.130 --> 07:53.170
d the babysitter                 who was killed six years ago?

07:53.320 --> 07:54.870
Just that they were both             bludgeoned to death.

07:55.020 --> 07:58.170
The babysitter was a lot older,and she wasn't covered.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.510
Covering a body ually             indicas remorse

08:00.660 --> 08:02.040
on the part of t killer.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.010
So you think he felt remseful         about is victim

08:04.170 --> 08:05.930
and not thone                 from six years ago?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.320
Maybhe knew Carmen Davis.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.290
There's thretootrushes,

08:11.270 --> 08:13.230
twof them  travel cases.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.160
My guess:

08:15.310 --> 08:17.480
the killer was staying here          with the little boy.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.220
There was no sign                of forced entry.

08:19.370 --> 08:20.910
PHILLIPS:                        Agent Malone?

08:21.060 --> 08:22.440
We're rey                    to take the boy out.

08:22.590 --> 08:23.850
Okay.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.280
(sighing):                       So,I assume

08:26.420 --> 08:29.300
we'll be sending over       the casevidence to Quantico?

08:29.450 --> 08:30.460
We can't process the evidence

08:30.600 --> 08:32.030
from every case               wee involved in.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.210
We have a maive                  overload already.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.549
This will be              joint jurisdiction.

08:36.690 --> 08:40.289
You do your thing,I'll do mine.

08:48.270 --> 08:51.360
COD is multiple               blunt-force trau.

08:51.510 --> 08:54.230
Based onhe develment                 of the contusions,

08:54.380 --> 08:56.820
it appearshe blow                to the back of the skull

08:56.970 --> 08:58.670
was the first impact,

08:58.830 --> 09:01.340
but the ones on the face         ca about half-hour later.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.010
Half ahour?         Yeah.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.120
Was she ped?

09:04.270 --> 09:05.030
Yeah.

09:05.510 --> 09:07.900
I,uh,did aet mount,

09:08.060 --> 09:09.720
found semen                      in the vaginal vault,

09:09.870 --> 09:12.260
and I collected an SAE kit.

09:12.410 --> 09:15.200
This guy is some pce of wo.

09:16.370 --> 09:19.430
I'll get it to DNA.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.370
No birthmarks.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.990
Our missing boy didn't have any,either.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.900
So the only way to  confirm the identity...

09:43.080 --> 09:47.520
I've had the original DNA report electronically sent to your lab.

09:47.690 --> 09:50.750
Well,then you'll just have to wait for your answer.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.130
You know,maybe now would be a good time

09:54.310 --> 09:57.710
for you to brief us  on the original case.

09:59.370 --> 10:01.140
JACK:    <i>His name was Jason Taylor.</i>

10:01.310 --> 10:03.170
(glass breaking)    <i>He was at his babysitter's</i>    <i>apartment.</i>

10:03.340 --> 10:05.130
<i>He'd been home sick</i>   <i>from school.</i>

10:05.300 --> 10:07.210
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

10:17.380 --> 10:18.970
<i>An unidentified male entered,</i>

10:19.140 --> 10:21.540
<i>most likely through an open</i>    <i>window on the fire escape,</i>

10:21.700 --> 10:25.830
<i>murdered the babysitter</i>     <i>and took Jason with him.</i>

10:29.490 --> 10:32.750
We never got a decent    description of the perp.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.360
Nothing was stolen?

10:34.510 --> 10:36.180
Cash was still in  the babysitter's purse;

10:36.360 --> 10:38.390
the only thing missing   was a baseball bat.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.590
Which,based on her wounds,you figure

10:39.780 --> 10:41.630
that was the murder weapon?    Mm-hmm.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.710
Baseball bat there,hammer here--

10:43.890 --> 10:45.510
weapons of convenience.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.420
Guy seems to grab    whatever's handy.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.010
WILLOWS: And takes it with him.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.800
Was the    babysitter raped?

10:50.970 --> 10:52.010
No.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.090
STOKES: Why kidnap a kid,

10:54.260 --> 10:56.510
wait six years,then kill him?

10:56.670 --> 10:59.920
WILLOWS:   Most four year olds will do   what you tell them.

11:00.090 --> 11:03.210
Most ten year olds will do what they want.

11:03.370 --> 11:04.900
BROWN: Kid starts asking the wrong questions,

11:05.060 --> 11:06.850
talking to the wrong people...

11:07.290 --> 11:08.560
Tons of possibilities.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.210
Yes. Way too many.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.140
According to this,the kid was adopted.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.900
Did you take a look   at the biological parents?

11:15.060 --> 11:17.910
Jason was adopted    as an infant.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.310
There was no way   we could track his records.

11:20.490 --> 11:21.500
BROWN: Adoptive parents had no contact

11:21.660 --> 11:22.710
with the kidnappers?

11:22.880 --> 11:25.350
They were not given   any ransom demands?

11:25.530 --> 11:27.070
There was no motive.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.360
I couldn't even give  the parents a reason.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.270
Maybe there isn't one.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.700
Most children are  abducted by somebody

11:33.860 --> 11:35.990
who's associated    with the family.

11:36.170 --> 11:39.650
Random kidnappings    are extraordinarily rare.

11:39.820 --> 11:44.620
Except in the U.S. last year,there were almost a hundred.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.800
Some things are just random.

11:48.950 --> 11:49.900
Have you ever tried telling that

11:50.070 --> 11:52.660
to the parents of a child  who's been kidnapped?

11:53.590 --> 11:55.710
Yes,actually,I have.

11:55.870 --> 11:57.690
And how'd that work out for you?

12:15.690 --> 12:16.900
Hey,guys.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.750
Found an empty jewelry  box in the bedroom.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.450
Maybe the killer   swiped the jewelry

12:21.610 --> 12:23.030
in addition to the cash.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.850
Easy to fence in   this neighborhood.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.370
Was the dead girl wearing any   jewelry when you found her?

12:29.530 --> 12:31.510
Nope.  Then that's    a good call,man,

12:31.660 --> 12:32.690
'cause she's wearing some in just about

12:32.850 --> 12:34.600
every one of these pictures.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.990
I wouldn't doubt if she kept    a lot of it in that box.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.990
I'll check with the local pawn shops,

12:39.160 --> 12:41.190
see if anything's been hocked.

12:46.970 --> 12:50.310
Hey,Greg,you see any books on the shelf over there

12:50.480 --> 12:52.990
on gambling or poker?

12:53.160 --> 12:55.600
No,just a lot   of romance novels,

12:55.770 --> 12:58.130
mysteries and  women's health.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.200
'Cause I got poker player stats,

13:00.370 --> 13:04.340
and multiple websites   on online gambling.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.310
Seems kind of out of place   to be the victim's.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.530
I think we got  a mystery houseguest

13:10.700 --> 13:12.920
who is a card shark.

13:30.150 --> 13:32.900
MAN (over speakers):  Welcome to our annual    poker tournament.

13:33.070 --> 13:35.180
The first of the elimination rounds are over

13:35.350 --> 13:38.400
and we're down    to our last 100 players.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.710
Good luck,everyone.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.810
You know what this is?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.290
Huh?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.070
This is police brutality.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.850
Yeah,whatever.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.580
We're not done yet.

15:33.910 --> 15:35.100
BRASS: Well,he doesn't  look like much,

15:35.260 --> 15:37.040
but then again,they never do.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.460
JACK:   If you don't mind,I'd like to talk to him first.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.030
You don't have   to be polite,Jack.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.000
This is a federal case,you don't need my permission.

15:49.370 --> 15:51.080
BRASS:   <i>How you going to go at him?</i>

15:52.100 --> 15:53.720
I don't know.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.430
I usually just make it up as I go along.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.330
BROWN: All done here.

16:06.490 --> 16:07.860
Thank you.

16:08.090 --> 16:10.030
You can leave,too.

16:15.180 --> 16:16.810
Mr. Michaels.

16:18.450 --> 16:21.500
Jack Malone. FBI.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.830
Huh.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.310
FBI.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.020
Mm-hmm.

16:29.070 --> 16:30.500
Why'd you run back there?

16:30.650 --> 16:32.440
Oh,I don't know. I was scared,I guess.

16:32.590 --> 16:33.310
Of what?

16:33.470 --> 16:37.250
Um... of getting caught.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.110
Being embarrassed.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.430
Right.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.850
So it's probably a good idea

16:42.020 --> 16:43.880
not to do anything that would embarrass you.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.810
Yeah,I know.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.030
But you never really think

16:47.170 --> 16:49.220
you're going to get caught,do you?

16:49.380 --> 16:51.100
Yeah,but you did.

16:52.870 --> 16:54.870
You want to talk    about it?

16:56.220 --> 16:58.860
I got nowhere I have to be.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.920
And you got nowhere to go.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.680
I don't know what    the big deal is.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.670
I mean...

17:14.260 --> 17:16.010
we've all thought    about it,right?

17:16.160 --> 17:19.000
Sure. It's natural.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.349
Right.

17:20.490 --> 17:21.880
I had a plan.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.619
It was simple.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.599
I take it...

17:27.040 --> 17:29.140
I play with it  for a little while...

17:29.310 --> 17:30.700
"It"?

17:31.270 --> 17:32.270
Like it's property?

17:32.430 --> 17:34.710
Yeah,yeah,it's nothing personal.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.210
I didn't even think Brother Willard would even miss it.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.390
Brother Willard?

17:41.130 --> 17:43.750
You want to talk to me   about Brother Willard?

17:47.470 --> 17:49.450
Brother Willard    is my spiritual advisor.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.410
He's supposed to talk me out of doing things like this.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.560
But you know what? Sometimes I just...

17:54.710 --> 17:55.650
I just feel like listening

17:55.800 --> 17:58.220
to that little voice inside my head.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.550
Hmm.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.440
Right.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.360
And what is that little voice

18:10.520 --> 18:13.600
inside your head  telling you right now?

18:14.810 --> 18:16.940
Just take it.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.730
"Just take it."

18:22.890 --> 18:24.770
This is not the first time  that you've taken something

18:24.910 --> 18:26.970
that doesn't belong   to you,is it?

18:27.110 --> 18:28.060
What do you mean?

18:28.210 --> 18:30.820
Six years ago,in New York City.

18:30.970 --> 18:31.780
I don't know anything  about New York.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.020
Six years ago,in New York City,

18:33.170 --> 18:35.120
you took something   that didn't belong to you.

18:35.270 --> 18:36.260
I don't know anything   about New York.

18:36.410 --> 18:37.940
Look,I told you-- I was going to give it back.

18:38.090 --> 18:39.590
Really,I just had  some bad luck.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.360
Is that what you call it?!

18:41.520 --> 18:42.760
You abducted and murdered

18:42.920 --> 18:44.000
a four-year-old boy!

18:44.140 --> 18:45.990
I don't know what  you're talking about!

18:46.140 --> 18:47.680
Hey...  JACK: Just bad luck?!

18:47.840 --> 18:49.500
Let him go.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.690
Look,you want to rendition him

18:50.850 --> 18:52.190
to Gitmo,be my guest,

18:52.350 --> 18:53.650
but in this house,we play by the rules.

18:53.810 --> 18:56.130
Now get your hand  off the suspect.

19:04.380 --> 19:05.900
What's that?

19:07.060 --> 19:08.490
That's...

19:12.800 --> 19:16.970
That's Evan. That's...

19:17.850 --> 19:20.300
This is my son.

19:21.310 --> 19:23.410
This is Evan.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.830
Guy's not the murderer. I know.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.690
We ran his palm print. Doesn't match.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.640
He's a Mormon from Utah.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.500
Stole $10,000 from the church,entry money into a poker game.

20:05.610 --> 20:08.630
Figured he'd win the money,replaced it before they noticed.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.560
And decided he'd bring his kid with him?

20:10.700 --> 20:12.270
Single parent.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.830
Carmen Davis  is an ex-girlfriend.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.550
Dropped the kid off with her.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.920
And while he's playing cards,they both get murdered.

20:19.070 --> 20:21.480
I got your DNA results.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.960
The dead boy was confirmed  as Tom Michael's son.

20:24.110 --> 20:27.190
So he's definitely not your kidnap victim from New York.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.030
However,the results of the SAE kit

20:29.180 --> 20:32.150
on the female victim showed two semen donors.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.970
One was Tom and the other    unknown,but that unknown

20:35.130 --> 20:37.470
was connected to two unsolved   rape murders in CODIS.

20:37.630 --> 20:38.890
Excuse me.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.490
Two years ago in Wyoming,11 months ago in Idaho.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.340
Okay,one victim was 23,the other one 54.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.400
One blonde,one brunette.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.310
Both female.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.750
Both with their faces covered.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.710
GRISSOM:  Both single,

20:54.870 --> 20:56.450
with no kids.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.990
Breaks the pattern.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.970
If there is a pattern.

21:00.530 --> 21:03.920
There's a big gap between   Vegas and New York.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.780
Now,this guy has been involved

21:05.930 --> 21:09.180
in four murders in the last two years.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.450
There's got to be more.

21:10.610 --> 21:11.370
Well,if there are,

21:11.540 --> 21:14.210
then there may not be any associated DNA in the system.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.560
Small towns usually can't afford to run it

21:15.710 --> 21:17.090
if they don't have a suspect.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.000
Doesn't mean there's not a pattern.

21:19.150 --> 21:21.490
Just means we haven't  found it yet.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.320
Special Agent Malone.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.540
David Hodges.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.300
The granular powder that you found

21:37.470 --> 21:39.140
on the dead boy's neck and shirt

21:39.300 --> 21:42.140
was largely ammonium nitrates and sulfates--

21:42.290 --> 21:44.760
commercial grade fertilizer.

21:44.930 --> 21:45.680
Great,so the  killer could be

21:45.830 --> 21:48.350
from any farm in   the United States.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.280
Yeah,or any backyard.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.510
Thank you.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.640
So,I was curious about opportunities

21:53.790 --> 21:54.840
at the federal level.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.570
Pay scale,working conditions...

21:57.950 --> 21:59.020
You want   my honest opinion?

21:59.170 --> 22:00.840
Absolutely.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.860
There's a lot less competition in Vegas for a guy like you.

22:05.010 --> 22:08.400
The FBI has enough ass-kissers already.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.700
I'm looking    for Tom Michaels.

22:17.860 --> 22:19.670
Yeah,he's in there.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.290
You might want to give him    a minute,though.

22:21.450 --> 22:23.740
He's,uh,saying good-bye.

22:23.890 --> 22:25.860
Do you have any kids?

22:28.210 --> 22:31.850
Yes. I have two daughters.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.640
Um,Mr. Michaels...

23:04.330 --> 23:07.150
I wanted to apologize    for my behavior earlier.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.370
You're afraid I'm going to sue?

23:16.150 --> 23:18.680
The same man  who murdered your son

23:18.840 --> 23:22.140
kidnapped another boy six years ago.

23:22.550 --> 23:23.890
He's here in Vegas,right now.

23:24.030 --> 23:26.670
And this is closest that I've    ever been to him.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.980
You thought it was me.

23:30.170 --> 23:32.080
I promise you...

23:32.790 --> 23:35.710
that I will do everything in my    power to catch this man.

23:36.030 --> 23:39.400
Is that what you told    the other boy's parents?

23:47.560 --> 23:48.860
Those the items?

23:49.720 --> 23:50.810
Yep.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.220
Damn.   This always happens to me.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.730
Is that the surveillance?

23:54.900 --> 23:55.840
Yeah.

23:57.210 --> 23:59.110
That's the guy.

23:59.260 --> 24:00.690
Okay.

24:00.850 --> 24:02.970
I almost didn't call  you guys,you know.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.610
What about me?   I'm out 350 bucks.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.110
You'll live.

24:07.260 --> 24:09.130
The woman these items    belonged to is dead,

24:09.290 --> 24:10.410
along with a kid.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.330
Oh.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.520
Is there a reward?

24:14.660 --> 24:17.670
Shut up. You saw him   the night before last.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.460
You talk to him?  He say anything to you?

24:19.600 --> 24:23.740
Not much. He showed me the  jewels. I gave him his $350.

24:24.950 --> 24:27.240
Uh,he asked me for directions    to the Tangiers.

24:27.390 --> 24:29.370
Hmm. I showed him how to get there.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.300
Recommended that    Let It Ride game.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.920
It's been pretty  lucky for me.  (phone dialing)

24:33.070 --> 24:34.730
Good for you.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.200
MAN: Tangiers Hotel.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.470
This is Captain Jim Brass,LVPD.

24:39.620 --> 24:42.990
Would you connect me to the  surveillance room,please?

24:44.400 --> 24:47.080
JOHNSON:   That's definitely not a guy    you want to go home with.

24:47.230 --> 24:50.520
That cocktail waitress doesn't know how lucky she is.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.450
We need a shot of his face.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.860
Well,I think he knows that.

24:58.590 --> 25:00.250
Just... hold on.

25:00.410 --> 25:01.710
Zoom in on the ball cap.

25:02.470 --> 25:03.940
There's a logo.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.980
"Hargreen Harvest."

25:12.840 --> 25:14.310
He had commercial fertilizer  on his hands

25:14.460 --> 25:16.650
when he killed Evan Michaels.

25:16.790 --> 25:18.640
He's a migrant worker,perhaps.

25:18.790 --> 25:21.670
Well,Tangiers sent over more   than 12 hours on this guy.

25:21.820 --> 25:22.500
It's gonna take some  time,but of course

25:23.590 --> 25:25.770
I'll let you know the  minute I find anything.

25:25.930 --> 25:27.580
Okay,great.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.520
I'll call in    some additional AV Techs,

25:31.680 --> 25:33.720
help Archie get through the   footage,but you know,

25:33.870 --> 25:37.210
I've learned that sometimes you  can go faster by going slow.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.250
Yeah,well,I like to go    faster by going fast.

25:40.410 --> 25:42.220
Waiting around is not   exactly my best thing.

25:42.370 --> 25:44.270
I gathered that from your interrogation technique.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.710
You know,maybe you should go back to your hotel,take a nap.

25:48.260 --> 25:51.420
Is this your office?   Really? By choice?

25:51.580 --> 25:54.960
It's not some kind of,uh,surplus overflow issue?

25:55.800 --> 25:57.550
What's wrong with my office?

25:57.700 --> 25:59.260
Oh,I don't know.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.290
Uh... why don't you tell me?

26:02.440 --> 26:04.500
That's an irradiated fetal pig.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.960
I used it to determine the effects of radiation on tissue.

26:08.110 --> 26:09.060
For what?

26:09.220 --> 26:10.560
For fun.

26:10.710 --> 26:11.730
SIDLE:   Hey,Gil,I,uh...

26:11.890 --> 26:14.080
Oh,I'm sorry. I didn't   mean to interrupt.

26:14.230 --> 26:17.650
No,no,it's fine. Jack Malone,FBI. Sara Sidle,CSI.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.360
(mutters):   Hi.

26:18.510 --> 26:22.520
Hello. I hear your abduction  case is now a serial murder.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.670
Uh... yeah.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.760
Well,uh,I got called    into work early,

26:30.920 --> 26:32.510
but I did pick up Hank,

26:32.670 --> 26:34.030
and I took him to the sitter.

26:34.190 --> 26:37.490
Thank you.  I'll see you when I see you.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.780
Pleasure. Hmm.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.690
Is Hank your kid?

26:42.030 --> 26:45.630
Hank's my dog. She walks him for me sometimes.

26:45.790 --> 26:48.000
Oh,yeah,that's how it starts.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.900
Oh,I have some experience dating in the workplace.

26:52.070 --> 26:55.210
Really? And,uh...

26:55.360 --> 26:57.230
how'd it work out for you?

26:57.500 --> 26:59.270
Undetermined.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.850
(gasping):   Please,help me,help me...

27:31.020 --> 27:33.740
Kid who found the old man says  he lives here with his wife.

27:33.910 --> 27:35.330
She doesn't answer.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.790
You think the suspect's   still  here?

27:38.480 --> 27:40.300
We'll know in a minute.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.130
You better wait here.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.230
Sara...

28:39.750 --> 28:43.070
????

28:43.400 --> 28:46.690
Yeah. You want to do the autopsy,too? Just let me know.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.270
My guess is,this    is the hammer

28:48.410 --> 28:50.760
we didn't find at the Davis house.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.840
Why take the murder weapon from one scene,

28:53.990 --> 28:56.060
walk around with it  for more than a day,

28:56.220 --> 28:59.400
use it to kill again,but this  time leave it behind?

29:00.130 --> 29:02.310
SIDLE: Maybe he found   something better...

29:02.740 --> 29:04.940
Colt .45 auto.

29:05.730 --> 29:07.410
Case is empty.

29:12.130 --> 29:13.080
Huh.

29:15.510 --> 29:19.760
He lost the proceeds from the Vegas murders at the Tangiers.

29:19.910 --> 29:22.200
So,he probably needed more cash.

29:22.370 --> 29:24.310
Double murder ATM.

29:24.650 --> 29:27.000
Driver's license is on top,like before.

29:27.740 --> 29:29.410
He likes to know their names.

29:29.910 --> 29:32.460
I heard the husband  died at the hospital.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.530
But the killer was definitely  here awhile.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.110
According to liver temp,

29:37.310 --> 29:40.060
????

29:40.220 --> 29:42.700
So the husband was here    and alive while his wife

29:42.850 --> 29:45.520
was being raped  and killed?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.180
It looks that way.

29:59.780 --> 30:00.770
Sara?

30:01.670 --> 30:02.820
You okay?

30:04.490 --> 30:06.100
I don't know.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.510
Do you have any idea how he selects his victims?

30:10.490 --> 30:11.530
No.

30:12.270 --> 30:15.260
He picks houses with no   security systems,or dogs.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.820
Enters at night when  most people are asleep,

30:17.970 --> 30:19.970
through open    doors or windows.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.560
Easy targets.

30:22.130 --> 30:24.770
So,basically at random.

30:27.170 --> 30:31.490
They were spending a night on the sofa,watching a movie.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.310
(voice breaking):    It's just,uh...

30:37.160 --> 30:38.900
It's just wrong.

31:04.290 --> 31:05.230
Grissom.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.760
You at the Boulder City house?    No,I'm at

31:06.930 --> 31:09.930
a railroad spur about a quarter    of a mile from the house.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.440
You taking a trip?

31:11.600 --> 31:14.280
Carmen Davis's house was next to    the tracks,too.

31:14.430 --> 31:15.180
So?

31:15.330 --> 31:18.230
Freight trains carry    bulk fertilizer.

31:18.390 --> 31:21.350
I think your killer  is riding the rails.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.710
All the Alevious murders were committed

31:23.870 --> 31:27.710
within about a mile of an active railroad spur.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.430
Right,so he gets off the train,finds his victim,

31:30.580 --> 31:31.910
kills them,rapes them  if he feels like it,

31:32.080 --> 31:33.590
then just takes off.

31:33.890 --> 31:36.770
So,I cross-referenced   similar-patterned unsolveds

31:36.930 --> 31:38.980
in ViCAP by proximity to rail spurs.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.900
There's at least a dozen cases.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.850
You know,you have the authority to stop all the trains

31:45.000 --> 31:46.010
coming in and   out of Nevada.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.360
Well,I'm not gonna do that  unless I got a face.

31:49.260 --> 31:50.070
If these are the work  of your guy,

31:50.220 --> 31:52.530
he's piled up    one hell of a body count.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.340
JOHNSON: Guy kept his head down    the entire time.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.340
STOKES: Mm-hmm.

32:01.390 --> 32:03.510
Oh,check out what happens   when he runs out of money.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.400
He starts hitting    on the waitress,

32:06.550 --> 32:08.940
been doing it to every one of them that walked by.

32:09.530 --> 32:10.690
And this...

32:10.850 --> 32:13.650
is the last good image of him  before he leaves the casino.

32:13.810 --> 32:18.660
He stops to look at this poster and quickly makes a phone call.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.590
STOKES: Three numbers?

32:21.860 --> 32:25.100
I don't know too many serial killers that dial 911.

32:25.270 --> 32:27.260
He's calling Information.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Uh,yes,this is CSI Nick Stokes with the Vegas PD.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.800
I need to get the telephone number

32:34.950 --> 32:36.930
of one of your pay phones on the casino floor.

32:37.090 --> 32:39.610
Near the,uh,Let It Ride tables.

32:40.670 --> 32:41.840
Yes,ma'am.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.730
So,why was he so interested in this poster?

32:45.270 --> 32:47.060
Oh,great. Okay.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.380
Mm-hmm.

32:52.190 --> 32:54.120
Very good.   Thank you.

32:55.230 --> 32:56.800
Look at this. What is it?

32:56.960 --> 32:58.770
South Point Casino,just outside Boulder City.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.990
Might be a reason henent there.

33:06.100 --> 33:08.710
Hey,it's Nick. Uh,I need to get an AG waiver

33:08.850 --> 33:10.720
to get ahold of some phone numbers.

33:10.860 --> 33:12.710
Yeah,exigent circs.

33:13.010 --> 33:13.940
Mm-hmm.

33:14.810 --> 33:19.800
702-555-0177.

33:20.130 --> 33:20.710
At,uh...

33:20.860 --> 33:21.810
17-41-33.

33:21.970 --> 33:24.870
17-41-33.

33:25.190 --> 33:27.110
Yes,ma'am,day before yesterday.

33:27.270 --> 33:30.000
Well,we know this guy likes waitresses,

33:30.160 --> 33:32.190
so maybe that's what he's looking at.

33:32.430 --> 33:33.440
Is that a "D"?

33:33.590 --> 33:37.390
No. "G," "G-I-R"... "N"?

33:38.300 --> 33:39.600
Okay,thanks.

33:39.750 --> 33:40.860
Gina.

33:41.010 --> 33:42.310
Gina Farentino.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.500
He called Information to get  her number in Boulder City,

33:44.670 --> 33:45.810
but it's unlisted.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.340
Maybe that's  what pissed him off.

33:49.510 --> 33:51.580
He knows where she works.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.240
Yeah,Gina works here;    she's off today,though.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.370
Probably at home.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.480
We checked her house; she's not there.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.100
When was the last    time you saw her?

34:04.260 --> 34:05.670
Not since yesterday.

34:07.060 --> 34:08.820
What about this  guy,seen him?

34:11.090 --> 34:13.820
This is the best picture you got?   What do you think?

34:16.969 --> 34:17.889
There was a guy...

34:18.360 --> 34:19.330
I don't know if it's him.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.820
He was was on those slots  when Gina came on her shift.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.150
<i>Guess it was his lucky day.</i>

34:28.449 --> 34:30.139
<i>Must've thought the jackpot</i>     <i>gave him a shot at her.</i>

34:30.290 --> 34:31.880
<i>He started chatting her up.</i>

34:32.570 --> 34:33.300
Oh...

34:33.460 --> 34:35.820
Where are you going? No,no,no,no.

34:35.889 --> 34:37.590
Hey,come here,come here.    What time do you get off?

34:37.690 --> 34:38.580
<i>She blew him off and left.</i>

34:38.730 --> 34:40.080
<i>Said she wasn't feeling well.</i>

34:40.139 --> 34:41.469
And when did he leave?

34:42.360 --> 34:44.270
He cashed out  and left a few minutes later.

34:44.429 --> 34:45.610
How much did he win?

34:45.770 --> 34:46.650
Um...

34:47.550 --> 34:48.650
$2,500.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.920
I need to take a look   at his W2-G,okay?

34:52.540 --> 34:54.690
If you make over    twelve hundred bucks,

34:54.840 --> 34:56.770
Uncle Sam gets   his cut,you know?

34:57.280 --> 34:58.740
That's how  we stay in business.

34:58.900 --> 34:59.890
Mm-hmm.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.930
It's got name,address,social...

35:03.090 --> 35:04.550
The whole thing  has got to be bogus.

35:04.710 --> 35:07.700
Yeah,the cashiers don't really    seem to care,no offense,

35:07.860 --> 35:10.990
as long as you have    a picture ID.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.110
And even when that's fake...

35:15.810 --> 35:17.850
you can't fake one of those.

35:29.190 --> 35:32.940
DISPATCH:  Chevy Impala,Nevada license Adam-Robert-Charles-Boy-4-2-1.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.820
No wants or warrants.   Welfare check only.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.990
License owner  is a Gina Farentino.

35:37.150 --> 35:38.850
Copy,Dispatch.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.440
License and registration,sir.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.290
I got it right here.

36:49.660 --> 36:52.800
Same caliber as the one taken  from thefroulder City double.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.380
You can see the whole thing  on video if you want.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.050
Was the waitress  in the car with him?

36:59.270 --> 37:00.970
He was waving at somebody  in the passenger seat

37:01.140 --> 37:02.730
when he got shot.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.720
According to the time code    on the dash cam,

37:04.860 --> 37:06.640
it was about 33 minutes ago.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.410
That's a pretty good head start.    Yeah.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.350
I don't want to lose this guy.

37:16.850 --> 37:17.660
Grissom.

37:17.820 --> 37:18.740
We ran the fingerprints

37:18.890 --> 37:21.290
that Nick lifted    from the casino IRS form.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.720
Got an AFIS hit.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.730
Terry Lee Wicker.

37:24.890 --> 37:27.580
Served two years in Sing Sing  for burglary.

37:27.740 --> 37:28.760
He got out four months

37:28.920 --> 37:30.400
before Jack's original   kidnapping,

37:30.540 --> 37:32.530
and get this,when he was sent up,

37:32.690 --> 37:35.310
he was married   to Gina Farentino.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.640
Brass put out a broadcast.

37:37.790 --> 37:38.580
Listen,do me a favor.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.570
Take a look at the map,

37:39.730 --> 37:42.580
find the nearest railway spur    to our location.

37:49.420 --> 37:50.950
Meadowood.

37:51.710 --> 37:55.490
It's off the 93,and it looks to be about...

37:55.630 --> 37:58.710
16 miles northeast    of your location.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.600
What the hell's going on?

38:33.980 --> 38:35.740
Did you see    who drove this car here?

38:35.890 --> 38:37.020
No,but I called the tow company.

38:37.170 --> 38:38.980
You can't park here. (train whistle blowing)

38:43.600 --> 38:44.840
Where's that train going?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.020
The Fresno 211.

38:46.190 --> 38:47.260
Chicago bound.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.830
Any other trains pass through here in the last hour?

38:49.970 --> 38:52.500
No,and nothing else is scheduled for another hour.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.920
Can you stop that train?

38:54.080 --> 38:56.300
I don't have that capacity,no.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.390
Who you guys looking for?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.900
You starting to miss the lab?

39:53.050 --> 39:54.860
No,I like a good field trip.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.400
Right. Stay behind me.

40:36.210 --> 40:39.290
Freeze! Put your hands  where I can see 'em!

40:39.740 --> 40:40.890
You Wicker?

40:41.470 --> 40:43.180
No. The name's Baxter,

40:43.330 --> 40:44.950
and I ain't got no ticket.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.140
Where'd you get that hat?

40:46.310 --> 40:49.110
Oh... from a man.

40:49.260 --> 40:51.850
He gave me a hundred bucks  to get on this train.

40:52.270 --> 40:53.290
I don't want no trouble

40:53.440 --> 40:56.000
I mean... don't shoot.

41:07.310 --> 41:08.880
GRISSOM: Maybe,uh...

41:09.690 --> 41:12.210
he came here to kill his ex-wife.

41:12.750 --> 41:13.810
(sighs):  Why?

41:19.110 --> 41:19.850
Grissom.

41:20.010 --> 41:20.770
It's Brass.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.670
Listen,the Boulder PD  got a call from the principal

41:23.830 --> 41:25.300
at the local elementary school.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.820
Gina Farentino was supposed   to pick up her son,

41:27.980 --> 41:29.160
only she didn't show up.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.140
Yeah,there's a reason for that.

41:31.290 --> 41:32.100
She had a son?

41:32.250 --> 41:33.940
The kid's name is Kobe.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.300
Yeah,according    to the principal,

41:35.450 --> 41:37.410
a guy fitting   Wicker's description

41:37.560 --> 41:40.360
came and picked him up  in the mother's car.

41:40.610 --> 41:42.390
He said the kid   seemed to know him.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.860
Thanks,Jim.

41:54.870 --> 41:56.270
Hey,Jack.

41:57.430 --> 42:00.370
I don't think that trooper   was waving at Ging.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.060
License and registration,sir.

42:09.210 --> 42:10.420
I got it right here.

42:13.300 --> 42:14.750
You said the kid    who was kidnapped

42:14.910 --> 42:16.320
was six years old when he was adopted,

42:16.470 --> 42:18.210
birth parents unknown.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.580
That's right.

42:20.620 --> 42:24.020
Terry Wicker was looking   for his ex-wife...

42:25.430 --> 42:26.690
And his son.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.240
A family reunion.
