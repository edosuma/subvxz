WEBVTT

00:11.678 --> 00:14.305
Whoo! Come on, Baby Humans!

00:14.389 --> 00:16.850
Oh, oh. You gotta try
a Chicago-style baked potato.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.144
Why does everything
have to be "Chicago-style" here?

00:19.227 --> 00:20.979
We get it. We're in Chicago.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.314
-Come on. Just try it.
- Look at this.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.316
Fork and knife individually wrapped.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.444
-So much plastic!
-Oh!

00:27.527 --> 00:29.195
-Oops.
-Yeah. "Oops."

00:29.362 --> 00:33.366
Or the Chicago Baby Humans are owned
by the brother of the CEO of Plastico.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.534
And we are thereby complicit

00:34.617 --> 00:37.037
in this incestuous money-laundering
scheme that's, oh,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.039
by the way, killing the planet.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.876
But what are you gonna do, right?

00:46.880 --> 00:51.676
<i>♪ Pick yourself right up</i>
<i>When you're feeling down ♪</i>

00:52.343 --> 00:57.766
<i>♪ Friendly smiling faces all around ♪</i>

00:57.849 --> 01:03.396
<i>♪ The sun is shining down on you and me ♪</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:07.901
<i>♪ Happiness is there for all to see ♪</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:14.115
<i>♪ Everybody, come on</i>
<i>And get your happy shoes on ♪</i>

01:14.199 --> 01:19.662
<i>♪ I said, "Everybody, come on</i>
<i>And get your happy shoes on" ♪</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:24.834
<i>♪ Whoa, everybody, come on</i>
<i>And get your happy shoes on ♪</i>

01:35.011 --> 01:36.638
-Good morning, beautiful.
-Oh!

01:36.721 --> 01:39.390
Wanna go try and hit
a Chicago-style museum?

01:39.474 --> 01:43.061
Oh, I'd love to, but I really have
to work on my book. Next time.

01:43.144 --> 01:46.439
Great! I've made my romantic offer.
I've officially been a good boyfriend.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.567
I will now retreat to our living room
to play video games all day.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.218
Hello. I am Diane,

02:57.302 --> 03:00.930
and I am a young girl living in Boston
and ever since I was that,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.224
I wanted to write good things
that were good,

03:03.308 --> 03:05.602
this is not good, fix this later.

03:05.685 --> 03:09.814
Diane, as your father,
I am very unsupportive.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.484
Come up with examples
of Dad being unsupportive.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.654
Okay, yes.
And, also, the girls from high school.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.239
Hey, I'm Krissy Keating.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.283
Can you use my real name?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.368
Check if it's okay to use my real name.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.245
Anyway, I was a real bitch to you,

03:24.329 --> 03:27.123
but now maybe you're realizing
I was bullied, too?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.751
-Is any of this interesting?
-<i> Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:31.669
Put me in your book.
Remember I gave you that salad bowl?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.504
And I broke the bowl!

03:33.588 --> 03:34.923
Answer your phone.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.383
And I glued it back together with gold

03:37.467 --> 03:41.638
because I read an article
about the Japanese art of kintsugi!

03:41.721 --> 03:44.891
-And it fell apart again.
-It kept falling apart like our marriage!

03:44.974 --> 03:48.353
Is that something?
Is any of this anything?

03:48.436 --> 03:50.980
<i>Diane. Answer your phone.</i>
<i>I'm calling you right now.</i>

03:51.064 --> 03:52.815
-What?

03:55.151 --> 03:56.402
-Hello?
-<i> Hey, Diane.</i>

03:56.486 --> 03:58.863
If I had my shitty students
do a night of scenes here

03:58.947 --> 04:00.949
at the end of the semester,
would you come see it?

04:01.032 --> 04:04.160
It's gonna suck, so I wanna pack the house
with friendly faces.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.454
When you sell it like that,
how can I resist?

04:06.537 --> 04:07.372
<i>How's that book coming?</i>

04:07.455 --> 04:10.250
-I'm actually at the mall, writing it now.
-Why are you writing at the mall?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.126
I couldn't focus at home
and this is the only place

04:12.210 --> 04:13.878
I could sit and work for ten hours.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.797
I can get lunch here, I can people-watch,

04:15.880 --> 04:19.717
all without having to endure
what the Chicagoans refer to as "spring."

04:19.801 --> 04:22.428
Hey, Chicago, 49 degrees is not spring.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.223
-It's the non-Lachey half of a boy band.
<i>-What?</i>

04:25.306 --> 04:27.100
Forty-nine! Half of 98?

04:27.183 --> 04:29.769
Diane, don't workshop your material
in casual conversation.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.313
Howie Mandel used to do it, too.
Like, really, Howie?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.857
You just happened to have a rubber glove
in your pocket?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.568
All I need to do now
is actually write my book.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.279
I have so many stories to tell,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.823
but I can't seem to figure out
what the book is.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.825
You gonna put any stories
about me in there?

04:43.908 --> 04:47.495
-I think I've written about you enough.
<i>-But no one else is as good at it!</i>

04:47.578 --> 04:49.872
I'm sure someone will rise
to the occasion.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.377
Baxter, darling, I've just a moment
to update you on the progress

04:54.460 --> 04:55.920
of our Penny Carson crusade.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.381
So far, we've been able to contact three
of the four Penny Carsons

04:58.464 --> 04:59.716
listed in New Mexico.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.678
Baxter, there's nowhere I'd rather be
than on our honeymoon cruise to "Unjuga,"

05:03.761 --> 05:05.471
but I simply can't stop now.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.891
We're on the lookout for the fourth Penny,
and, God willing, she'll be the lucky one.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.519
Oh! Hey.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.146
-Caw-caw! Caw-caw!

05:13.229 --> 05:16.232
Oh...
Sorry, I didn't mean you. Paige!

05:20.194 --> 05:23.156
Kisses, Baxter dear,
it appears we've found our deer.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.368
Okay. Book, here we go.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.705
I grow up in Boston town
because my father,

05:30.788 --> 05:32.790
who I never was close with,
live in Boston.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.209
That's not right English,
I'll fix it later.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.711
Me from Boston.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.255
Well, you're not from Boston, but yeah.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.631
-Whatever for now.
-Beantown.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.384
To really understand
what it's like to grow up in Boston,

05:43.468 --> 05:49.557
you actually have to go back 250 years
to the Boston Tea Party.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.770
Taxation without representation
is wicked unjust, bro!

05:53.853 --> 05:56.564
Bro, check it out.
I'm teabaggin' the harbor.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.399
Oh, no freakin' way.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.362
-Go, Pats. Unrelated.
- Stop.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.739
-I'm getting distracted.
-Why can't you stay focused?

06:04.822 --> 06:06.491
What's wrong with your head, Deedee?

06:06.574 --> 06:09.327
The idea behind
the Japanese art of kintsugi

06:09.410 --> 06:12.038
is that cracks in an object
are part of its history.

06:12.121 --> 06:15.541
-What does that have to do with anything?
-We have to look at trauma!

06:15.625 --> 06:16.459
Ugh.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.461
We totally have to look at Trauma.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.712
-What?
-There's a spring sale.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.547
Forty percent off.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.632
Ooh!

06:27.804 --> 06:28.930
Did you hear

06:29.013 --> 06:32.100
security still can't figure out
who's stealing wallets? Like...

06:32.433 --> 06:35.311
I bet my life it's that hag Devon
from the hair crimper cart.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.523
Oh, my God, yes,
that theory is beast, Ivy.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.733
-Excuse me, I'm sorry...
-We forgive you.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.569
You know the story about Gemberly, right?
What they found in her locker?

06:43.653 --> 06:44.737
-Tell me.
-It was a--

06:44.821 --> 06:47.323
I meant "Pardon me, I need another size."

06:47.407 --> 06:49.617
But I can't seem to find
a number on the tag?

06:49.700 --> 06:54.163
-We don't see size here at Trauma.
-Okay, but can you help me?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.541
Sure. I think it would help
if you figured out

06:56.624 --> 06:59.585
why you need to put a number on your body,
and let me get back to this mystery.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.753
Thanks.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.298
-Hello?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.260
Oh, my God,
she's like taking a phone call.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.262
Diane! Great news!

07:09.345 --> 07:12.765
"Birthday Dad" premiered last night
to a 0.006,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.350
which is the biggest network hit

07:14.434 --> 07:16.310
since the inventor
of blood-scented perfume

07:16.394 --> 07:18.396
went on <i>Shark Tank</i>
and got her arm bitten off.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.313
Great!

07:19.397 --> 07:22.191
Meanwhile, my company's running
like gangbusters.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.609
Is gangbusters a slur of some sort?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.403
-Can we still say gangbusters?
-I'll look into it.

07:25.486 --> 07:29.782
And with Todd watching the baby,
my work-life balance is on point.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.993
-Did you call me just to brag?
<i>-I was thinking...</i>

07:32.160 --> 07:35.371
What would make my work-life balance
even on pointier?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.123
And it hit me: more work!

07:37.206 --> 07:39.625
So, I thought I'd check in
and see how your book's doing.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.547
Oh. I'm still kind of figuring out
what the "is" of it is, you know?

07:44.630 --> 07:48.551
-It's been six months.
-Okay, I think it's about...

07:48.634 --> 07:50.011
-Trauma.
<i>-Trauma?</i>

07:50.094 --> 07:51.554
Or... damage.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.930
You know, those bowls that break

07:53.014 --> 07:55.850
and then the cracks get filled with gold
and then they're even more beautiful?

07:55.933 --> 07:57.185
Maybe it's like that, you know?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.769
Like, we've all been damaged,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.522
but it's good damage
because it makes us more who we are.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.440
Is that anything?

08:02.523 --> 08:05.318
Yeah, good damage. I like it.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.153
Send me the pages
and we'll get 'em to the publisher.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.738
Okay, but no hurry?

08:08.821 --> 08:11.574
Okay, but, no. Hurry.

08:14.035 --> 08:14.869
What can I get ya?

08:14.952 --> 08:17.288
Some information
with a side order of revelation.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.748
Is that a type of pasta?

08:18.831 --> 08:21.334
Oh, also a water. I am parched.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.711
In fact, why don't you freeze
that water into a cube shape

08:23.794 --> 08:25.505
and drop it in some bourbon.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.299
We're looking to identify
an associate of Sarah Lynn's.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.135
Sarah Lynn? Is this about BoJack?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.970
Is it about BoJack?

08:33.054 --> 08:35.723
I don't know what you're looking for,
but I don't know anything about it.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.434
Okay? I haven't seen BoJack in years.
Or Sarah Lynn.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.102
But you have seen them?

08:40.978 --> 08:43.731
I'm gonna go ask the kitchen
about your pasta.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.024
BoJack?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.526
Wait, that's the fellow
from the police report,

08:46.609 --> 08:48.110
who found the dead girl
in the planetarium.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.530
-Yes?
-<i>Found</i> the dead girl.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.323
-Are you smelling what I'm smelling?

08:52.406 --> 08:54.450
If he was also with her
at the AA meeting...

08:54.534 --> 08:56.911
Well, then why wouldn't he mention it
to the police? What's he hiding?

08:56.994 --> 08:58.746
You're starting to make more sense
than a change machine.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.791
Yeah, speaking of cents,
what happened to Penny?

09:02.250 --> 09:06.587
-Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop!
-Go, go, go! Gotta stay in the loop!

09:11.175 --> 09:16.347
"So in a way, that salad bowl was me,
and the cracks... were also me..."

09:16.430 --> 09:18.891
-Ugh! It sucks, I'm sorry.
-It's a first draft.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.936
I can't remember what happened when
and I keep getting distracted.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.730
It's because of the meds.
This is what I was afraid would happen.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.815
But isn't it worth it?

09:25.898 --> 09:27.692
You've been feeling
so much better, right?

09:27.775 --> 09:31.237
I do feel lighter, and clearer,
but also so foggy.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.574
You feel clear and foggy?
How is that even possible?

09:34.657 --> 09:37.827
-I don't know! Because of the fog.
-Hey. Stick with it.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.830
-With the writing? Or the fog?
-Both.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.168
Okay. So, start at the beginning.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.086
I'm a baby.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.879
Hey, baby!

09:48.963 --> 09:53.384
Isn't it great to grow up in a comfortable
upper-middle class home,

09:53.467 --> 09:54.719
surrounded by love?

09:54.802 --> 09:57.763
But I didn't grow up surrounded by love.
That's the problem.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.142
You were fine!
Name one example of me being a bad dad.

10:01.225 --> 10:05.271
Uh, okay! What about how you made me lose
on purpose at Boggle

10:05.354 --> 10:09.191
so my brothers would think they were,
quote, "wicked smarter than a girl."

10:09.275 --> 10:11.444
-That's all you got?
-I got other things!

10:11.527 --> 10:15.406
There was lots of shit. Constantly!
I just can't express--

10:15.489 --> 10:19.118
Is this what your book is?
Just you complaining?

10:19.201 --> 10:22.079
As your target audience,
I'm not hooked yet.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.539
You are not my target audience.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.042
This book is like bore me
with a spoon, Diane.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.752
You know the story about Gemberly, right?

10:27.835 --> 10:29.712
-What they found in her locker?
-Tell me.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.632
It was a note from the thief,
saying where all the wallets were hidden.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.384
What? What is this? I'm trying to write
about my childhood trauma.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.053
-Who are you?
-I'm Ivy.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.805
My mom and I just moved to Chicago
from Southern California.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.015
<i>What? No. I can't...</i>

10:41.098 --> 10:43.476
My dad died and we needed a new start.

10:43.559 --> 10:47.146
I don't really get Chicago yet,
and the winters are cold AF,

10:47.229 --> 10:49.190
so I hang out at the mall a lot.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.316
Malls are fun!

10:50.399 --> 10:53.110
Or "beast," which is slang
that young people like me say.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.614
-You're Ivy Tran, right?
-Ivy T. That's me!

10:56.697 --> 10:57.823
I-I need help.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.325
Someone's been filching onesies

10:59.408 --> 11:01.160
by the twosies
from the fourth floor Baby Hole,

11:01.243 --> 11:02.787
and if I don't figure out whodunnit,

11:02.870 --> 11:04.997
my manager's gonna mount my head
on the wall!

11:05.081 --> 11:07.917
Yes, managers can be very annoying.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.043
I'll take the case.

11:09.126 --> 11:13.005
-Oh, and, also, I'm Vietnamese-American.
- Beast.

11:13.547 --> 11:17.218
"Ivy Tran, Food Court Detective"?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.470
Well, I like this. It's fun.

11:19.553 --> 11:23.099
My book is supposed
to be a profound treatise on damage.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.976
But I can't even access my damage.
I'm too...

11:26.060 --> 11:28.896
-hopped up on goof-berries!
-What the hell is a goof-berry?

11:28.979 --> 11:31.732
I need to go to a dark place,
and I can't get there.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.735
When I'm with you, when we're out,
I feel good, I feel happy,

11:34.819 --> 11:36.278
but the minute I sit down to write--

11:36.362 --> 11:38.781
You were having trouble writing
this book when you were depressed,

11:38.864 --> 11:40.866
and you're having trouble
now that you're not depressed.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.660
Is it possible that you just--

11:42.743 --> 11:45.121
-What? That I'm just a shitty writer?
-No.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.248
That you just don't wanna write this book.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.126
I do, though. It's just hard.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.795
But that means it's worthwhile.
Good things are hard.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.548
I'm not writing
<i>The Mall-related Mysteries of Ivy Tran!</i>

11:55.631 --> 11:57.842
- Why not?
-Guy, come on.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.677
-No. You come on.
-You come on.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.180
Diane, I'm gonna tell you
what I always tell my good friend Eileen.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.267
-Don't do it.
-Eileen, come on.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.108
More drugs, please!

12:14.692 --> 12:17.153
-Hello?

12:17.236 --> 12:20.406
I soft-pitched your book
to Brad Pitt's company, Plan B,

12:20.489 --> 12:22.992
and Craig Bierko's company, Plan C.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.786
They're very excited
about the movie adaptation.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.079
What movie adaptation?

12:27.163 --> 12:30.082
Gee, I don't know,
a new Robin Hood adaptation.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.752
No, Diane, the adaptation of your book!

12:32.835 --> 12:33.711
What book?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.589
Come to think of it, a new Robin Hood
sounds pretty good. Judah!

12:36.672 --> 12:39.759
-Maybe from Maid Marian's point of view?
-Directed by Sofia Coppola?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.385
I'll try Rebecca Ferguson's agent.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.970
<i>You're still on the phone with me!</i>

12:43.053 --> 12:46.432
Oh, right. The town has really responded
to your pitch about damage.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.850
It wasn't a pitch!

12:47.933 --> 12:50.102
Imagine, all the little Dianes out there,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.897
just waiting to see their story
on the big screen

12:52.980 --> 12:55.608
during a brief Oscar-qualifying run
in New York and LA.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.610
You don't think it's too sad, do you?

12:57.693 --> 12:59.820
It wouldn't be better
if I wrote something more fun?

12:59.904 --> 13:04.033
<i>Diane, sad is the new fun.</i>
<i>Besides, the sad is what makes it you!</i>

13:04.116 --> 13:06.869
-Really?
<i>-Yes! Everyone's very excited.</i>

13:06.952 --> 13:08.454
<i>But they wanna see pages.</i>

13:08.537 --> 13:10.956
So, do what you do and get me that sad!

13:11.040 --> 13:12.500
Just got back word from Sofia.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.959
She's booked for the next year

13:14.043 --> 13:15.961
developing a new <i>Peter Pan</i>
from Wendy's point of view,

13:16.045 --> 13:18.589
and Rebecca's doing a limited series
about the female ticket-taker

13:18.672 --> 13:20.424
at the cinema
where Batman's parents got shot.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.385
Ooh, that's really empowering.
Diane, I gotta go.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.556
Uh... Ngu-yen?

13:27.932 --> 13:29.266
N-Ngu-yen?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.352
No one?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.485
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, Pen!

13:39.568 --> 13:42.655
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.990
A girl can't visit her mom?
Why are you grilling me?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.409
Slow down. Breathe.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.537
Something happened at work.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.955
-Something?

13:51.038 --> 13:53.624
Or someone...s?

13:53.707 --> 13:55.334
Did you follow me home?

13:55.417 --> 13:56.502
If you didn't wanna be followed,

13:56.585 --> 13:58.629
you should have been more judicious
with the turn signal.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.881
A lady doesn't need to always announce
where she's headed.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.508
Yes. Who taught you how to drive?

14:02.591 --> 14:06.262
-Uh, can I help you?
-Paige Sinclair, intrepid gal reporter.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.264
And I'm Max!

14:09.014 --> 14:09.849
Okay.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.017
We're circling a story
on the last days of Sarah Lynn

14:12.101 --> 14:13.644
and we're trying to nail down a timeline.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.230
We think your BoJack Horseman
may have played a part.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.356
I think you should go.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.149
Well, it was worth a try.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.487
Actually, I did see Sarah Lynn.
Right before she died.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.072
Oh! It was very worth a try.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.116
She came to Oberlin. With BoJack.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.661
-Whoa! BoJack came to Oberlin?
-And what happened?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.872
-Nothing. I mean--
-Why didn't you tell me?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.165
I saw them and told BoJack to leave.
That's it.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.377
-Were they intoxicated?
-Is BoJack ever not intoxicated?

14:38.460 --> 14:41.046
-Would you go on the record?
-No, she won't.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.424
Excuse us,
we are just about to sit down to dinner.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.926
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk?

14:46.010 --> 14:48.095
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk?

14:48.178 --> 14:50.222
-Penny--
-I'm not a kid, okay?

14:50.306 --> 14:51.932
-We should tell them about Maddy.
-No--

14:52.016 --> 14:52.850
Who's Maddy?

14:53.017 --> 14:54.476
My best friend in high school.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.186
BoJack was living here
and he bought her booze

14:56.270 --> 14:58.439
before the prom
and then she got alcohol poisoning.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.357
I'm sorry, he was living here?

15:00.441 --> 15:01.692
-Oh, what's this, a party?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.277
Did you guys forget to invite Kyle?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.863
-Dad...
-Ah, just kidding. Now it's a party.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.991
Kyle, these folks
are from the refrigerator repair company.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.036
And I just told them
that our refrigerator is working fine

15:12.119 --> 15:13.078
and they were just leaving.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.041
Quite. If you think of anything else,
please do give us a call.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.877
Ah. You know, the wine fridge
has actually been acting kind of funky.

15:19.960 --> 15:25.382
Two refrigerators? Ha!
Give my regards to the Rockafellers.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.515
Can you keep it down, please?

15:33.599 --> 15:36.310
I couldn't sleep
and you're like shout-whistling at me.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.646
Hey, I'm just whistling. Chicago-style.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.649
Don't. Just please be quiet.
I need to write.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.943
Okay. Okay. Write on.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.280
-Hey, how was the writing?
-What do you mean?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.907
You were gonna write today.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.867
Oh, is the day over?

15:51.951 --> 15:56.789
-I was just thinking my thoughts...
-Are you all right?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.707
-Oh! Oh, my God!

15:58.791 --> 16:01.168
-Diane, what's wrong?
-I...

16:01.877 --> 16:04.296
-Oh, oh, oh!

16:04.380 --> 16:07.216
-It's okay. I got it in the plant.
-Oh! Not in the toilet?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.218
I'm not gonna put my face in your toilet.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.262
-Don't be gross.
-Our toilet, baby. We've been over this.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.139
I had to think fast. Went for the plant.

16:14.223 --> 16:18.727
Okay, but the sink? Or the shower?
There's so many drains in there.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.145
I'm sorry. I gotta work.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.774
Hey.  Maybe you can just go back
to bed and you can work in the morning.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.985
No. Now. Gotta get it done.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.322
I'm 17 years old. I live in Boston.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.824
Krissy Keating's a real bitch to me.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.077
-Was I? Or did you deserve it?
-I deserved it.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.538
Your problem is you always blame
other people, Deedee.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.332
-I know.
-Who's a good baby? Not you!

16:40.416 --> 16:41.834
Where are my pages, Diane?

16:41.917 --> 16:46.422
I need pages for my beautiful celebrities,
such as Stockard Channing, Tatum O'Neal,

16:46.505 --> 16:48.549
Patrick Harrison Ford Focus.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.926
I'm trying to focus.
I'm trying to get to the truth.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.928
-I think you're afraid of the truth.
-No.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.514
Your damage isn't interesting
and you're unworthy of love.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.558
-No, I'm not!
-Of course you are!

16:57.641 --> 16:58.934
Are you, uh, you know,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.311
one of those stupid pop culture analogies
I'm always doing?

17:01.395 --> 17:05.315
Because you're charming at first,
but eventually enough already!

17:05.399 --> 17:07.026
You think you're a beautiful salad bowl?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.527
Conceited much?

17:08.610 --> 17:10.571
More like garden-variety, am I right?

17:10.654 --> 17:13.073
<i>You blame everyone else</i>
<i>for all your problems,</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:15.242
<i>but you're the one constant here.</i>

17:15.325 --> 17:17.119
<i>-Go Pats.</i>
<i>-</i>You're right.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.539
Diane, what is going on?

17:20.622 --> 17:23.584
There's a heaviness... on my chest.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.545
And it's not just my boobs, even though,
yes, my boobs are heavier now.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.464
-Hey. Talk to me.
-I stopped taking my meds.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.758
-Why?
-Because I'm terrible!

17:30.841 --> 17:33.719
I'm a stupid person! I deserve this!

17:33.802 --> 17:36.138
No. You're not a stupid person,
but you can't just--

17:36.221 --> 17:38.140
I want to die!

17:38.223 --> 17:41.101
-It's so much worse than before.
-Baby, you're going through withdrawal.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.563
Do I just have to be on drugs forever now?
How am I gonna finish my book?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.441
-Okay, forget about the book for a second.
-I can't!

17:47.524 --> 17:49.818
-It's the only thing that matters.
-Now, that's not true.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
I'm sorry.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.033
It's okay. It's okay.
Just take your pills. All right?

17:56.116 --> 17:59.787
Then when you even out we can talk
about trying something else, okay?

18:00.621 --> 18:01.538
Okay.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.874
I just-just wanna be
a beautiful salad bowl.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.376
You are a beautiful salad bowl.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.384
-How're you doing?
-A little better today.

18:14.593 --> 18:18.138
-And, uh, I wanted to say sorry.
-For what?

18:18.222 --> 18:20.682
I don't know. "Being Diane"?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.810
-Stop.
-I let the stress get to me.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.562
I should just call Princess Carolyn
and tell her I need more time.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.316
Yes. But before you do that...
don't be mad.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.400
Don't be mad about what?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.569
If I tell you, will you be mad?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.905
From the tone of this conversation,
I'm guessing probably.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.033
Okay, what you have to remember
is that you were in a really dark place.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.035
And the pressure from Princess Carolyn
wasn't helping.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.371
I thought if I could get her off your back
for a few days...

18:42.454 --> 18:43.664
What did you do?

18:45.874 --> 18:47.459
Guy, what did you do?

18:47.543 --> 18:51.755
I sent her the <i>Ivy Tran:</i>
<i>Food Court Detective</i> pages.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.298
-What?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Okay?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.009
-I made an executive decision!
-You're not an executive!

18:56.093 --> 18:58.011
I-I made a boyfriend decision! All right?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.013
I made a "my girlfriend
is a depressed, vomiting mess

19:00.097 --> 19:02.307
and someone needs to make a decision"
decision.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.308
Ugh!

19:03.767 --> 19:06.103
-Hello? No.
<i>-</i> <i>Loved it!</i>

19:06.186 --> 19:08.647
I love the protagonist, I love the world,

19:08.730 --> 19:11.817
I love that it wasn't your sad memoir
about your boring life.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.735
What happened to "sad is the new fun"?

19:13.902 --> 19:17.322
I didn't know you could write this fun!
You gotta finish this thing.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.408
I'm on pins and needles,
and I'm not just saying that

19:19.491 --> 19:21.034
-because I live with a porcupine.
-Listen--

19:21.118 --> 19:24.454
To the ka-ching, ka-ching
of the middle-grade IP market? Done!

19:24.538 --> 19:26.707
I slipped the pages to a few studios.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.544
This has franchise potential.
Franch potench.

19:30.627 --> 19:34.256
But what I'm saying is that it doesn't,
because that's not the book I'm writing.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.258
-I'm hearing a maybe.
-I'm not--

19:38.677 --> 19:40.804
Are we gonna have
a Boston-style fight now?

19:48.228 --> 19:49.563
<i>Here's a mystery.</i>

19:49.646 --> 19:51.773
Why are you so sad-core?

19:51.857 --> 19:55.110
-I don't know.
-Just be fun and popular like me.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.279
-I don't know how.
-Sure, you do!

19:57.362 --> 20:00.616
I'm clever and free-spirited
and a little bit sardonic

20:00.699 --> 20:02.367
but not so much that it's off-putting.

20:02.451 --> 20:07.456
I have vulnerabilities like everybody else
but just enough to make me relatable.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.292
-That's the way to be.
-It's not that easy.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.921
Yeah, I know.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.799
But wouldn't it be nice if it was?

20:22.763 --> 20:25.140
-Where's Princess Carolyn?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.644
She said we should save her a seat.
You still working on that memoir?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.854
Well, funny story about that--

20:30.938 --> 20:35.984
Oh, I love when stories start like that!
Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.071
-Hello. Thank you.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.406
Oh, wow. Thank you.
That's very nice. Thank you.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.743
Welcome to "An Evening
of Modern American Scenes."

20:44.826 --> 20:46.495
Oh, excuse me.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.455
-We have to talk.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.623
Shh. Diane!

20:49.706 --> 20:51.541
-Don't be rude to the actors.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.586
For most of them,
this'll be the height of their career.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.882
Anyway, first up is a scene
from Sam German-Shepard's "Real America."

21:03.178 --> 21:06.765
Char, hey, you gotta get in here!

21:06.848 --> 21:09.559
This episode of "Birthday Dad"
is an all-timer!

21:09.643 --> 21:12.521
-Penny...
-I wanted to get something.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.529
I don't feel good about
what happened with those reporters.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.824
-It's okay.
-We didn't tell them... everything.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.955
I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.916
I know that's messed up,
but I think I look nice here.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.168
Oh! You look beautiful.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.005
I don't think that's the only reason
I kept the photo, Mom.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.548
It's all really confusing.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.093
Charlotte! Birthday Dad
just got trapped in a leap year!

21:43.176 --> 21:45.429
-How's he gonna wriggle outta this one?
-In a minute, honey!

21:45.512 --> 21:48.849
Stuff happened to us, okay?
And he's still out there.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.642
-Penny--
-If we can get the word out,

21:50.726 --> 21:53.979
-if-if people knew--
-It won't be just him in the story.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.440
It'll be you and me. The mistakes we made.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.944
Mistakes I made,
that I will never forgive myself for.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.863
But if we can help other people,

22:02.946 --> 22:05.032
then it will have been for something,
you know?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.242
It won't just be this thing
to feel bad about forever.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.536
You don't know what's gonna happen
with the story once it's out there.

22:09.619 --> 22:10.704
You have no power over it.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.498
And you just got your panic attacks
under control.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.416
Yeah, I know, but--

22:14.499 --> 22:19.504
I love that you want to do what's right,
but please just think about it, okay?

22:19.588 --> 22:21.340
Just give it a couple days

22:21.423 --> 22:25.177
and then if you still want to talk
to them, you can call them.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.056
Okay. Thank you.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.308
You wanna stay and watch "Birthday Dad"?

22:31.391 --> 22:33.518
-Stay the night?
-No, I-I should go.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.646
Okay. Yeah. I love you.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.982
I love you, too.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.620
Oh! Is that the International
Date Line?

22:51.703 --> 22:55.082
Don't go over the date line, Birthday Dad!

22:55.165 --> 22:58.335
Because then it won't be your birthday
anymore!

23:01.338 --> 23:03.382
Thank you. Thank you so much.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.508
Come on, Todd, let's go.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.386
But I wanna see
if there's an after-credits scene.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.471
- Talk soon, Diane.
-Hey, wait a minute.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.140
-Princess Carolyn.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.393
Princess Carolyn, wait.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.104
I understand you're trying to be helpful,

23:17.187 --> 23:19.731
-in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.
-Oh, thank you.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.734
But I don't wanna write
a middle-grade fiction detective series.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.236
I think you do, though.

23:24.319 --> 23:28.115
Because when I was reading it,
I could tell you were having fun.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.450
Yeah, but I'm not writing a book
to have fun.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.994
If I don't write my book of essays now,
I never will!

23:33.078 --> 23:34.746
So? Don't write your book of essays.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.289
-I have to!
-Why?

23:36.373 --> 23:40.794
Because if I don't,
that means that all the damage I got

23:40.877 --> 23:43.880
isn't good damage, it's just damage.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.715
I have gotten nothing out of it,

23:45.799 --> 23:48.593
and all those years
I was miserable was for nothing.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.514
I could have been happy this whole time
and written books about girl detectives

23:52.597 --> 23:55.183
and been cheerful and popular
and had good parents,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.727
is that what you're saying?
What was it all for?

23:57.811 --> 23:58.645
I...

24:00.063 --> 24:01.440
I don't know, Diane.

24:01.523 --> 24:06.069
All I know is that this book
about the girl detective is fun.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.195
I liked it.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.655
I like thinking that my daughter

24:08.738 --> 24:10.991
could grow up in a world
with books like that.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.453
Or if my daughter's not a reader,
a lucrative film adaptation.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.414
When I was a little girl,
I thought that everything,

24:17.497 --> 24:22.043
all the abuse and neglect,
it somehow made me special,

24:22.127 --> 24:24.296
and I decided that one day
I would write something

24:24.379 --> 24:27.340
that would make little girls like me
feel less alone.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.719
And if I can't write that book...

24:30.844 --> 24:31.678
Then...

24:32.762 --> 24:35.015
Then maybe write this other book.

24:35.599 --> 24:39.311
-Maybe this book does that, too.
-Yeah?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.111
-Uh... Princess Carolyn?
-What reporters?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.029
BoJack?

24:49.112 --> 24:51.948
Charlotte, I swear,
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.916
-Hey, man, great show.
-What? Huh?

25:01.625 --> 25:05.045
-Uh...
-Oh, no!

25:05.128 --> 25:06.546
