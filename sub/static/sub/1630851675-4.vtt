00:01.869 --> 00:06.605
Ve I told you that
chris is, like, managing me?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.907
I call him my husbanger.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.728
- Carter, get up
and brush your teeth!

00:12.763 --> 00:13.929
Robyn, you gotta
get out the bed.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.230
- All right.
- Come on, do somethin'.

00:15.266 --> 00:16.398
I'm tired of it.

00:16.434 --> 00:19.351
- I didn't expect this pandemic
to still be goin' on.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.552
Come on, get up.

00:20.571 --> 00:21.920
Your class is
in there minutes.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.388
I've been burnt out.

00:23.407 --> 00:24.356
Back to bed.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.161
- Okay.

00:29.196 --> 00:29.762
- Yeah, it's a little
tough doin' this

00:29.797 --> 00:31.597
when you're on the phone,

00:31.632 --> 00:33.032
and juju is doin'
her thing.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.199
- I don't wanna hear it.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.585
Tell daddy that mommy
is the boss.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.621
For so many years, gordon
was out running around

00:39.673 --> 00:40.756
building an empire.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.124
Now, gordon is home
with the kids,

00:42.176 --> 00:44.126
and I've taken more
of a leadership role

00:44.178 --> 00:47.513
and being the boss ceo
in charge.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.132
- What is the status?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.583
[sighs]

00:51.602 --> 00:52.951
- with mr. Bryant,
should we be

00:52.987 --> 00:55.020
in something called
a relationship, right now?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.355
I don't think so.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.691
- I didn't feel like they
were that deeply in love

00:59.727 --> 01:01.226
where this is
a shock to me.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.562
- Mia said once she
realized that gizelle

01:03.597 --> 01:05.064
had wished death on ray,

01:05.099 --> 01:07.733
she said that she is
probably just a pretty face.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.318
- Mia said that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.319
- Can I say somethin'?
- You said-you said-you said--

01:10.371 --> 01:13.305
- you have to understand
you said I was shady.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.656
You tried it.
- This is--

01:14.708 --> 01:15.791
- I am zen wen.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.076
So, do not try
to come for me

01:17.111 --> 01:18.794
because what I do have

01:18.829 --> 01:20.963
and what I will
always have is time.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.915
So, tick tock, mia.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.720
- The secret to
this pretty face

01:28.756 --> 01:30.155
is stayin' in the shade.

01:31.308 --> 01:34.159
- If you wanna pop off,
I'll be happy

01:34.195 --> 01:36.011
to get you adjusted.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.330
- I may keep you waiting,
but trust me,

01:38.365 --> 01:40.332
I'm worth it.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.001
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.806
- My blessings are many,
and my patience

01:47.842 --> 01:49.408
is none.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.544
- This professor doesn't
just grade on the curve.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.496
She sets the curve.

01:54.532 --> 01:57.850
- The grand dame can never
be duplicated, imitated,

01:57.885 --> 01:59.918
or intimidated.

02:01.789 --> 02:12.498
♪♪

02:12.533 --> 02:13.849
- knockity-knockity.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.767
- Hey!

02:15.803 --> 02:17.102

02:17.138 --> 02:18.737
Give me hugs and kisses.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.873
Boom. Boom.
- And then we--

02:20.908 --> 02:21.874
we can do--
we can do a butt boom.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.775
- Boom!
Did I knock you over?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.561
- Almost, almost.
- Did you fall?

02:25.613 --> 02:26.979
- Damon, I'm sorry.

02:27.014 --> 02:27.946
How ya doin', sir?
- I'm good. How is everything?

02:27.982 --> 02:28.947
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This is damon.

02:28.983 --> 02:29.848
- How you doin'?
I know damon, my photographer.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.867
All right, so, I'm gonna
go put this on,

02:31.902 --> 02:33.285
and then you can
get me together.
- Okay.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.020
Yes, yes. Okay.
- Yes, yes, yes.

02:35.039 --> 02:36.622
During the covid,
robyn and I decided to do

02:36.657 --> 02:39.124
a couple instagram lives
together because we're besties,

02:39.160 --> 02:40.425
and a lot of people
chimed in,

02:40.461 --> 02:41.827
and they were like,
"oh, my gosh,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.078
y'all should have
a podcast."

02:43.130 --> 02:45.063
so, this is
the podcast room.

02:45.099 --> 02:46.882
We have a table.
- Okay.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.600
- We have a chair.
- We need at least...

02:48.636 --> 02:50.035
...One more chair.
- At least one more chair.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.888
And it's called
"reasonably shady."

02:52.923 --> 02:53.705
- I love it.
- Okay.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.090
Gotta still
touch me up, right?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.092
Robyn is all
the way reasonable,

02:57.144 --> 02:58.844
and I'm shady, honey.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.095
You know, robyn
is always late.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.231
My work ethic,
robyn's work ethic

03:02.266 --> 03:03.899
are very different.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.517
Gotta shine these legs up.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.320
So, I don't know how
this partnership is gonna last.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.254
- It's okay.
- These toes are not done.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.906
- Exactly.
- These are pandemic toes, okay?

03:10.941 --> 03:13.192
- That's pandemic toes.
[laughing]

03:13.227 --> 03:14.693
- knock-knock.
- Hey!

03:14.728 --> 03:15.911
- Hi, guys.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.530
- I was just talking about you,
trashing you a little bit.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.365
- You were? What?
Saying that I was late.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.733
- Yes.
Why don't you change?

03:21.752 --> 03:22.801
- Okay.

03:22.836 --> 03:23.735
All right.
I'll be right back.

03:23.754 --> 03:24.803
- Okay.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.271
Kal, we have
not been traveling.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.256
You was doing
the damn thing.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.423
- Yeah, but you were
traveling also, you know?

03:28.459 --> 03:30.759
- Well, you know, I was
in atlanta every five seconds.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.927
Me and jamal were
back and forth,

03:31.962 --> 03:33.212
back and forth,
back and forth.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.847
In 2020, I could
have been to atlanta

03:35.883 --> 03:39.117
maybe two or three times.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.418
- So, how does that work?

03:40.437 --> 03:41.937
- So, I don't know.
I-I haven't really been

03:41.972 --> 03:43.689
feeling good about
where we are.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.107
I mean, you can't have
a long distance relationship

03:45.142 --> 03:47.893
in the pandemic.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.479
- I don't--
I think you can.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.530
- You do?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.166
- If it's communication
on both ends, you can.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.652
- I'm concerned about
me and my needs, okay?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.153
- Those are really creepy,

03:58.205 --> 04:00.489
and I'm not gonna ask you
what those needs are.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.623
- And it's not even,
like, ooh, sex.

04:01.659 --> 04:02.491
- But it ain't right.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.909
- It's like just being
able to like--

04:03.944 --> 04:05.477
- someone being your face.
- Yeah.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.629
- But, gizelle, you don't
want people near you.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.982
- Now, I'm in a new space.
Like, I need to see my guy.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.717
He needs to be
eight minutes down the road.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.485
- I mean...
[sighs]

04:13.520 --> 04:15.220
I think maybe the breakup
woulda happened

04:15.256 --> 04:16.805
at some point.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.957
But the pandemic
probably just

04:18.976 --> 04:20.225
made it more clear

04:20.261 --> 04:22.978
that maybe this is
not working out.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.646
- So what does that mean?

04:24.682 --> 04:26.515
- As of right now,
I'm just feeling like

04:26.567 --> 04:27.299
it's day by day.

04:27.318 --> 04:29.534
So, that's-that's
that on that.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.353
I need to give you
an update on grace.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.238
You know, she's gettin'
that learner's permit.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.473
Kal, she just keep goin'
in there and failin'.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.875
So, what do we think?
We're gonna try to get

04:36.910 --> 04:38.110
the learner's permit, again.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.245
- Third time is
definitely the charm.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.197
- She's embarrassing
the bryant name, at this point.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.750
Robyn, that's so pretty.
- Thank you,

04:44.785 --> 04:45.917
thank you.
- Um...

04:45.953 --> 04:48.003
Listen, kal...

04:48.038 --> 04:49.921
There's been a new lady
that we have met.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.323
Her name is mia.
- Mm-hmm.

04:51.342 --> 04:52.591
- She said she
had her clit done.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.160
Please explain to me
what that means.

04:55.179 --> 04:57.012
- I haven't seen one
since the '90s.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.164
[laughing]
no, really.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.682
- That's a bit much.

05:00.718 --> 05:01.499
- Am I done?
- Yeah.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.168
- You can start on robyn.
- Yeah.

05:03.187 --> 05:06.038
- So, an-ty-way,
wendy and mia got into it.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.773
Did mia call her
a simple woman?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.041
- Simple minded.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.942
- Wendy, simple minded?
- We-- I mean--

05:10.978 --> 05:11.860
- with 18 degrees, no way.

05:11.895 --> 05:12.911
No way.
- Right, right.

05:12.946 --> 05:13.945
- Okay, but that's
not the point.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.697
And then wendy says...

05:15.733 --> 05:17.316
- You are dismissed.
- She's so worried about me.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.483
- You're dismissed.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.052
- She just wouldn't
let us talk.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.119
And then karen bein' there,

05:21.155 --> 05:24.039
mia probably didn't really
know which way to go.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.290
- Right.
- You know, so,

05:25.326 --> 05:26.325
I almost feel like
we probably should

05:26.360 --> 05:28.493
reach out to her and say--
- reach out to mia.

05:28.528 --> 05:32.047
- Yeah, like, let's try
to get together with her

05:32.082 --> 05:33.332
on our own.
- Okay.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.166
Maybe, like, we can get together
for some drinks or something.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.051
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna say-- hold on.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.053
- Hi, mia.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.538
Chatting with robyn.

05:39.573 --> 05:43.642
We would love to get
together for drinks.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.062
And I'm gonna say
without karen.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.263
- Yeah.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.981
- Without karen.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.184
Okay, we all know that karen is
not a good judge of character.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.319
However, mia seems nice.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.490
Mia has her pulse on something
called discernment, okay?

05:58.525 --> 05:59.408
'cause any time
you're gonna come in

05:59.443 --> 06:01.076
and sit down next to me
and say, "ooh."

06:01.111 --> 06:02.444
- I'm just meeting gizelle,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.062
and I'm a good judge
of character,

06:04.081 --> 06:06.448
and she has
a beautiful heart.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.266
- Mia is very up front.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.601
- What am I missing?
- But-but-but I think--

06:09.636 --> 06:11.086
- I even had my clit
worked on.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.271
- Mia is everything, honey.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.073
And I look forward to
gettin' to know her better.

06:15.092 --> 06:16.908
Okay, so, let's get
these pictures in.

06:16.927 --> 06:18.460
- Yes.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.879
- So, are we both
sitting like this?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.631
Okay, yeah, let's do--
let's do a professional one.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.216

ahh!

06:24.251 --> 06:25.767
- What?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.103

06:28.138 --> 06:29.721
That's nice.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.591
There you go.
Nice.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.359
Dance with me.
Have some fun.

06:35.696 --> 06:36.995

15:41.408 --> 15:43.408
[laughing]
- you look great, though.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.093
Yes.
- Thank you.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.929
I gained,
like, 14 pounds.
- Okay.

15:47.981 --> 15:48.930
- I was, like, drinking wine
at, like, 8 in the morning.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.016
- Right. Yeah, no, for--
- and staying up 'til 4.

15:52.051 --> 15:52.900
- Right.

15:52.936 --> 15:53.918
- Eatin' ice cream
all night, whatever.

15:53.954 --> 15:54.919
So, I was like, okay,
this has got to stop.

15:54.955 --> 15:55.770
- Right.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.755
- I used to be
very active, very fit.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.692
- Two, three four,
arms up, then down.

16:00.727 --> 16:04.395
- But when the pandemic hit,
I got so lazy.

16:04.414 --> 16:06.897
And since juan is a coach,

16:06.916 --> 16:09.834
he's wired to, like, want you
to get up and move.

16:09.869 --> 16:10.935
I feel like when
I wake up early, like,

16:10.971 --> 16:13.237
I'm out of it.
- Work out.

16:13.256 --> 16:14.422
[laughing]

16:14.457 --> 16:15.406
- I hear you.

16:15.425 --> 16:18.009
I'm going to try to
do something about it.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.627
Oh, okay.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.045
[laughing]
- hi.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.680
- Yes, it's a fur.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.048
Hi, boo.
How are you?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.450
- So, let me ask you this.
- Yeah.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.436
- How much definition can I get
in my booty from one workout?

16:28.471 --> 16:29.437
- You can get
a little pump.

16:29.472 --> 16:31.189
- Okay.
- Wendy.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.790
- Wendy.
- Hey, ladies.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.926
How are you?
- Hey, I'm good. How are you?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.728
- What you got us
out here doin'?

16:36.763 --> 16:39.447
- We're trying to kickstart
out fitness, okay?

16:39.482 --> 16:40.448
- Ahh! Ahh!

16:40.483 --> 16:42.600
- I know you got
your new body and everything.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.168
- Look.
- But you wanna maintain it.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.236
- Girl.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.373
- Robyn has us out here in
the cold, and I swear,

16:48.408 --> 16:50.124
like, my silicone
is gonna freeze.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.309
- All right.
Grab your kettle ball.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.378
And then once you're ready,
you're gonna hike the ball

16:53.413 --> 16:54.979
back to where your wrists
hit your inner thighs

16:55.015 --> 16:56.464
and drive 'em
through those hips.

16:56.499 --> 16:57.215
Stand up nice and tall.
- Ooh.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.384
- Ooh.
- Come up all the way.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.019
- This bell may
take me out.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.120
- Try and maintain
that booty, girl.
- Go ahead, girl.

17:03.139 --> 17:06.290
We're gonna go for a squat
and a leg kick back.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.426
- I feel that kim kardashian
booty comin'.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.496
- Ready, set, sit,
and wave.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.481
Let's go, askale.
- Go, askale.

17:13.516 --> 17:15.099
[laughing]

17:15.134 --> 17:16.851
- you guys,
I'm really trying.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.704
- Yes.
- Yes, baby, there you go.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.307
- All right.
- Three, two, time.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.443
Good job, ladies.
- My breast is gonna pop out.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.211
- You guys did amazing.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.113
Keep up the great work.
- Oh, thank you.

17:29.148 --> 17:30.948
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye. So good meeting you.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.483
Thank you.
- You, too. See ya.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.618
- You hurt?
[laughing]

17:33.653 --> 17:36.153
- I sound like I just ran,
like, the boston marathon.

17:36.172 --> 17:36.921
- I know.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.790
- And we only did
a short workout.

17:38.825 --> 17:39.590
This ain't right.

17:39.626 --> 17:40.991
- Maybe we should
just take a walk.

17:41.010 --> 17:41.859
- Cool down.
- Yeah.

17:41.895 --> 17:42.860
- That's my type of outing.
- Yeah.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.995
[laughing]
all right.

17:45.014 --> 17:47.131
Oh, wait, candiace
is callin'. Hello.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.434
- Girl.
- Well, girl, what's up?

17:51.688 --> 17:54.522
I am taking a walk
with wendy and askale.

17:54.557 --> 17:56.224
We just finished
a little workout.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.477
- Hi, candi.
- Hi.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.946
- What's the word?
- So...

18:07.120 --> 18:08.119
- Okay.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.991
- Oh, we're gonna
braid each other hair.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.209
- Yay!

18:15.245 --> 18:17.078
- We're gonna make
friendship bracelets.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.162
- Yay!

18:18.197 --> 18:21.365
- The clothes in here are
literally from college.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.800
- I'll help you sort.

18:22.836 --> 18:25.035
- You know what I was thinking
about doing, though?

18:25.054 --> 18:27.572
Having, like,
peace-out house party.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.140
- Oh, you should.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.975
- I would probably invite,
like, all the girls.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.977
Karen has a new friend, mia.
- Okay.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.113
- Um, she's, like,
this glamazon

18:35.148 --> 18:37.148
with, like, huge feet.
Her feet are so big.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.283
But she's tall, so I guess
that makes sense.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.186
I moved into this house
in my early 20s,

18:42.221 --> 18:46.223
and I'm leaving
in almost my mid-30s.

18:46.242 --> 18:49.944
So, it's definitely
closing really magical,

18:49.996 --> 18:51.913
crazy chapter
in my life.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.434
- Oh, thank you.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.592
- Oh, lord have mercy.

19:04.627 --> 19:06.177
- Wait, what do you--
can't wait, candi.

19:07.630 --> 19:08.779
All right, candi.
- Thank you.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.881
- All right.
Okay, bye.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.966
So, this will
be interesting.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.851
- The pajama jammy jam?
- Yes.

19:13.887 --> 19:17.421
I wanted to get askale's
take on the pamper party.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.225
- It seemed like everything
was kinda around drama with mia.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.944
- Every ten seconds, you put
your foot in your mouth.

19:22.979 --> 19:24.812
- Clearly, she's
unhappy at home. So...

19:24.864 --> 19:25.780
- You're unhappy at home.

19:25.815 --> 19:26.781
That's why you need to
get your clit fixed.

19:26.816 --> 19:28.065
- Girl.
- Ahh!

19:28.101 --> 19:29.784
- Her name gonna
have to be messy mia.

19:29.819 --> 19:31.269
- Yeah, but didn't even--
[laughing]

19:31.304 --> 19:32.537
- 'cause she got herself
in a whole lotta mess.

19:32.572 --> 19:37.041
♪♪

19:39.112 --> 19:40.845
- okay, wonderful.
Can you let her up?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.648
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you so much, ma'am.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.083
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, karen.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.502
- Where you are?
- Hi, honey. Come on in.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.638
- Come on, diva.
I love this.

19:50.673 --> 19:52.890
- How are you?
- I am good.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.592
- Good to see you. I love--
- this is stunning.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.093
- Thank you.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.161
Make yourself at home.
- Yes.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.629
- Do you want me
to take your coat?

19:58.665 --> 19:59.530
- No, we can
put it right here.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.464
- This is the dining room.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.099
This is where we're
gonna have our tea.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.668
I'm gonna go get
some, um, hot water.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.969
- Okay.

20:04.988 --> 20:07.137
You got my name on
the bread plate. Omg.

20:07.156 --> 20:08.372
- Ha!

20:08.408 --> 20:10.524
So, we haven't had a chance to
talk since the pamper party.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.043
- No, we haven't.

20:12.078 --> 20:15.279
- I thought we were
coming to celebrate ashley.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.364
- Yeah.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.865
- Ha! Did we do that?

20:17.917 --> 20:20.284
- I felt like they
were attacking you,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
primarily because, I think,
of our relationship.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.822
Gizelle is famous for saying,
"oh, karen, you know,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.090
"she doesn't
have any friends."

20:26.125 --> 20:27.008
but I'm cool
with the girls.

20:27.043 --> 20:29.660
I really don't have
a problem with robyn

20:29.679 --> 20:31.679
except she does
gizelle's bidding.

20:31.714 --> 20:34.215
- Mm-hmm.
- And I think she's up her bush.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.299
- Oh, my god.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.602
Don't get me started on
that topic of discussion.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.170
- Wait, but you and robyn
haven't had anything.

20:39.205 --> 20:42.840
- Uh, we, well, we hadn't
until a couple days ago.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.008
- Ooh.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.610
- So, gizelle and I
were together,

20:45.645 --> 20:47.695
and we did a photo shoot for
something that's coming up.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.146
- Oh, that's cute.
- Thank you.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.450
We were talking about
the pamper party,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.619
and we were like things
kind of just went left.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.854
We wanna, like, sit down,
have drinks with mia,

20:56.889 --> 20:59.724
clear the air, whatever.
So, gizelle texts her.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.025
- She goes, "hi, mia.

21:01.044 --> 21:03.210
"robyn and I are
sitting here talking,

21:03.246 --> 21:06.430
"and we wanna get together
with you, with drinks,

21:06.466 --> 21:08.699
"without karen."

21:08.718 --> 21:12.303
[laughing]

21:12.338 --> 21:14.405
- ooh, you said,
"without karen."

21:14.440 --> 21:16.741
- oh, god.
- Oh, lord, what happened?

21:16.776 --> 21:17.942
- Oh!
[laughing]

21:17.977 --> 21:19.727
- did you respond?
- I sure did.

21:19.762 --> 21:23.347
- Mia replies, "hi, gizelle.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.650
"unless you want
to discuss business,

21:25.685 --> 21:28.886
"there is nothing I have time
to 'talk' to you about."

21:28.921 --> 21:30.354
- oh.

21:30.389 --> 21:31.422
- Let me know if you would
like for me to link you

21:31.457 --> 21:33.891
with my assistant to book
an appointment this week.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.910
- Ooh.
[laughing]

21:35.945 --> 21:37.611
- gizelle was definitely
trying to tell me

21:37.664 --> 21:38.729
how we're gonna maneuver.

21:38.748 --> 21:40.364
She was telling me exactly
who was coming to drinks,

21:40.399 --> 21:42.099
and she told me exactly
who not to bring.

21:42.135 --> 21:46.420
Uh, if you didn't already know,
um, I'm the boss.

21:46.456 --> 21:47.288
She knows now.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.590
- So, I-I just
couldn't let that go.

21:49.625 --> 21:50.941
So, I said, "hi, mia.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.427
"I'm quite taken aback
by your rude response.

21:53.463 --> 21:56.180
"was something done to you
that we are not aware of?"

21:56.215 --> 21:57.882
- yeah.
- "is this how you treat people

21:57.917 --> 21:59.517
"who are trying to get
to know you?

21:59.552 --> 22:00.751
"what am I missing?"

22:00.787 --> 22:02.353
she says, "at gizelle."

22:02.388 --> 22:04.772
- since my message
was directed to you...

22:04.807 --> 22:06.273
- Ooh.

22:06.309 --> 22:09.427
- I apologize if you felt
like my response was rude.

22:09.462 --> 22:12.263
I was simply being direct.
- And any response?

22:12.298 --> 22:14.098
- No response 'cause what
do you say after that?

22:14.133 --> 22:14.949
- Okay.
- At this point,

22:14.984 --> 22:17.201
I had nothing
to reply back to her.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.370
It's like, what is
karen feeding mia?

22:19.405 --> 22:22.039
I think karen
is influencing mia

22:22.075 --> 22:23.808
and wants to make us
the bad guys.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.793
- Hi.

22:25.828 --> 22:27.578
- Look, you'd be an idiot
not to be cautious

22:27.613 --> 22:30.214
coming into a lunch
with gizelle and robyn.

22:30.249 --> 22:33.450
- We invited mia because
we wanted to get to know her,

22:33.469 --> 22:36.687
and we were coming from
a good place, but, clearly,

22:36.723 --> 22:38.122
mia is being misguided.

22:38.141 --> 22:39.140
When you're friends
with karen huger,

22:39.175 --> 22:40.791
that's what happens.

22:40.810 --> 22:41.826
- I'm proud of you.
Do your thing.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.960
- Well, I mean...

22:42.979 --> 22:43.961
- I'm not saying that one day
moving down the road,

22:43.996 --> 22:47.131
you and gizelle won't
have cocktails together,

22:47.166 --> 22:48.232
but she gotta come
at you a different way.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.468
- And I would absolutely
go have cocktails with her.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.335
- Yeah.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.820
- But she can't put
stipulations on

22:52.855 --> 22:54.522
who I can and can't bring.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.507
That-that's not
what we're doing here.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.975
- Okay.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.276
- Coming up next...

22:59.311 --> 23:00.411
- I think she's coming.

23:00.446 --> 23:01.829
Oh, my god,
my stomach hurts.

23:01.864 --> 23:03.614
- Grace, what happened?
Did you pass?

23:03.649 --> 23:21.198
♪♪

23:21.234 --> 23:23.017
- hello.
- Hey, hey, hey,

23:23.052 --> 23:24.235

What's poppin'?

Yeah.
