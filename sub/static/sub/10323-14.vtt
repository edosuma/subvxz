Being in a coma is never fun,

00:05.239 --> 00:07.808
but Randy did his best
to cheer me up.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.544
Ooh.
"Basic nutrient pack."

00:10.611 --> 00:12.546
Now with cobbler.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.149
[ Earl Narrating ]
And I didn't have to worry
about doing my list,

00:15.216 --> 00:18.319
'cause my friends were
doing it for me, hoping karma
would help me get better.

00:18.386 --> 00:21.355
Wasn't always easy,
especially for Randy.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.592
So when it was his turn to pick,
he decided to do a list item...

00:24.658 --> 00:27.628
[ Doorbell Rings ]
at the one place he was sure
he knew how to get to.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.964
Hi, Mom. Me and Joy are here
to make up for the time Earl
ruined Dad's vacation...

00:31.031 --> 00:35.002
so we can cross it off
the list and wake Earl up
out of his coma.

00:35.069 --> 00:38.772
Earl's in a coma?
Carl, Earl's in a coma!
I'm getting my purse!

00:40.341 --> 00:42.910
- What happened?
- He got hit by a car
a month ago.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.113
Come on!
He's in a coma!
A month ago?

00:45.179 --> 00:48.116
And you didn't think
to mention that when you were
here for lunch last week?

00:48.182 --> 00:50.151
I got distracted,
okay?

00:50.218 --> 00:53.921
- How'd he get hit by a car?
- He was running in the street
after his intervention.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.390
- Intervention for what?
- Don't worry.
He was not on drugs.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.992
He was just acting crazy
after he got out of prison.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.564
Earl was in prison?
I'm gonna have to
revise my Christmas letter.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.135
My name is Earl.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.607
Oh, for goodness' sake.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.145
They've got him hooked up
to so many machines.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.782
Why is he wearing
a "do not resuscitate" bracelet?
That was my idea.

01:21.849 --> 01:26.754
Figured if they "suscitated" him
once and it didn't work,
they shouldn't do it again.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.857
Randy, please don't tell me
you're the one making
all the decisions about Earl.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.792
Yes, he is.

01:31.859 --> 01:35.229
Last week he demanded
they remove Earl's tonsils.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.531
In my defense,
I was pretty drunk.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.833
Take me to see
Earl's doctor right now.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.171
If he wakes up
while I'm gone,

01:43.237 --> 01:47.575
first thing you should do
is tell him there's a tube in
his wiener so he doesn't freak.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.478
I'll be in the cafeteria.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.252
So--
[ Sighs ]

01:58.319 --> 02:03.457
Randy told me that
you got the time you guys
ruined my vacation on your list.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.527
That was one
messed-up day.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.497
[ Earl Narrating ]
Ever since my parents made me
on their honeymoon,

02:09.563 --> 02:12.500
my dad had been
scared to death
to go on another vacation.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.002
But Mom finally convinced him
she wasn't fertile anymore.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.206
"American Samoa: Come see
why the Japanese wanted it."

02:18.272 --> 02:20.274
Sounds nice.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.243
Well, I thought
house-sitting...

02:22.310 --> 02:26.480
would be a wonderful opportunity
to show what responsible adults
you've become.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.783
Or you can
break my heart again.
It's up to you.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.487
I'll miss you both,
especially if your plane
goes down.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.723
I don't know if I'd miss you
more, but I'd miss you longer.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.891
You just say
whatever you think, don't you?

02:37.958 --> 02:40.861
Come on, Kay.
They can't disappoint us
if we don't leave.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.863
[ Earl Narrating ]
As soon as my parents left,

02:42.930 --> 02:46.234
me and Randy decided
to hit the liquor cabinet.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.036
It's gone.
It's all gone.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.239
This isn't
a liquor cabinet anymore.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.106
It's just a cabinet!

02:53.173 --> 02:56.577
Vacation time!
Let's get our drink on.
Ticktock, booze o'clock.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.779
Where are the boys?
I thought you
were pickin' em up...

02:58.846 --> 03:01.148
so they could play at
their grandparents' house.

03:01.215 --> 03:04.585
Their other grandparents' house.
I don't like 'em spending time
in two-story houses.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.355
They'll get all snooty
and start thinking about
college and vaccines.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.090
[ Earl Narrating ]
We decided to go
on a beer run,

03:10.157 --> 03:13.227
since there was no way
Joy was gonna do me
in my parents' bed, sober.

03:13.294 --> 03:16.997
I think Paula makes good points.
It's Simon that seems like
he's high all the time.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.999
I've never seen it.

03:19.066 --> 03:22.436
But Randy likes that guy
Randy the best 'cause
he's got Randy's name.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.506
Makes sense.
That's why I buy
Joy dish-washing liquid.

Guess what I learned.

'cause there's six beers in it.

When we got home,
we were surprised
to find the duffel bag,

04:16.690 --> 04:19.393
but even more surprised
by what was in it.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.962
Sweet mother.
Look at all that pot!

04:22.029 --> 04:25.032
I was hoping for money.
Or socks. I need socks.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.135
If it was money,
I could've bought socks.
So what do we do with it?

04:28.201 --> 04:31.905
We're not gonna smoke it.
Smoking weed kills
your brain cells.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.642
Drinking only
screws up your liver.
You got two of those.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.412
Yeah, I don't understand weed.
When you smoke, you get
the munchies and you get fat.

04:38.479 --> 04:42.115
When you drink, you throw up
and you get skinny.
That's just physics.

04:42.182 --> 04:46.286
How the hell did all this weed
get in the back of the car?
It probably fell from the sky.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.389
Sometimes surprises
fall from there.

04:48.456 --> 04:52.125
Remember that giant blue
Popsicle without a stick
landing on my head?

04:52.192 --> 04:54.094
It was disgusting.

My Aunt Sheila
used to get high as a kite
when she baby-sat me.

It was fun
until she convinced herself
she really was a kite.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.403
I'd have to
stand outside for hours,
holding her by a string.

05:02.470 --> 05:06.407
- Do you think Aunt Sheila would
buy a duffel bag full of weed?
- No, she's way into crack now.

Then we'll have to go buy
Baggies and get rid of it

But this is
a one-time thing.

I think Mom
would be really proud
of us right now.

Joy, make sure to get
flavored vodka. I like it when
my throw-up tastes like cherry.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.431
Flavored vodka is for sissies

You'll get what you get.

was such a piece of junk,

[ Earl ] The thing we learned
about finding a duffel bag
full of marijuana...

on your dead grandmother's
coffee table.

While we were off trying
to buy a duffel bag of weed,

keep her mouth shut, which,

I know you. You're that boy
from school that used to have
those panic attacks.

You'd have to lay on the floor
and suck your fingers. We used
to call you Floor Finger Sucker.

10:56.924 --> 11:01.561
Yeah? Well, I wasn't the
only one in high school with a
nickname that ended in "sucker."

11:01.628 --> 11:06.099
But unlike you, my nickname
just made me more popular,

All the stress
was really getting to Dwayne.

11:39.099 --> 11:44.537
So he snuck off to my parents'

But we still gotta
stop by the bank
and cash these savings bonds.

I'm sorry you have to
cash in your bonds, Dad.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.928
They're not mine.
Your relatives
gave them to you for college.

So when Harvard finally
comes calling, you're screwed.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.237
Hold on. You always said
these were back-up copies
of my birth certificate.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.405
That's because I knew
you'd steal them.

12:52.472 --> 12:56.343
But they're my money.
You've been keepin' it from me.
Who's the criminal now?

12:56.409 --> 12:59.479
I've been saving 'em until
I thought you were responsible
enough to handle them.

12:59.546 --> 13:03.783
Obviously that's failed,
because we're using them to buy
a duffel bag of marijuana!

13:03.851 --> 13:06.186
Now let's go.

Do I have
any savings bonds?
You have a couple.

But most of the relatives took
'em back when Mom brought you
home from the hospital...

and you still weren't
responding to light or sound.

After a quick stop at the bank,
we went to buy drugs...

eventually call home.

How could we both live here?
There's only one bed.
We're two guys.

We're not gonna end up
living in a motel.
