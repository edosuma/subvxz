<i>Man: Attention on deck.</i>

00:44.729 --> 00:46.644
<i>We are now arriving at Fire Island Pines.</i>

00:47.198 --> 00:49.198
<i>Welcome to Fire Island, everybody.</i>

00:49.199 --> 00:50.999
<i>Please take care exiting the boat.</i>

00:51.000 --> 00:53.202

have all your luggage...</i>

<i>Have a good day.</i>

01:22.301 --> 01:24.735
- Hey, Weeks.
- Hey, honey.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.405
How you doing?

01:27.406 --> 01:29.541
We're doing great.

01:33.045 --> 01:35.080
Here we are.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.454
What are you guys doing?

01:43.455 --> 01:46.423
Hairy is out. Your turn, teddy bear.

01:46.424 --> 01:48.225
Oh, no, I love my teddy.

01:48.226 --> 01:50.761
Calvin Klein would not approve.

01:50.762 --> 01:53.163
Baseball game is on

01:53.164 --> 01:55.699
and my summer has officially begun.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.134
The thing is, he actually means it.

01:57.135 --> 01:58.802
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?

01:58.803 --> 02:01.305
<i>- Cold beer?
- No, I've already had a couple.</i>

02:01.306 --> 02:03.840
Nice stripes, Lieutenant. Hot.

02:03.841 --> 02:06.042
Oh, please... Captain.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.944
Just got back from the Reserves.

02:07.945 --> 02:11.447
You know what they say, once a
month I get to play a real man.

02:11.448 --> 02:14.250
Oh, haven't seen you at the gym lately.

02:14.251 --> 02:16.853
Bruce?

02:16.854 --> 02:19.422
- Your turn, Bruce.
- What? What?

02:19.423 --> 02:21.691
Brucey, please, don't embarrass
our house at the beach, hon.

02:21.692 --> 02:23.760
Uh-oh. Gotta do it.

02:25.696 --> 02:27.230
You know what they say, Ned.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.532
If you can't beat 'em...

02:31.401 --> 02:33.436
join 'em.

02:35.639 --> 02:36.839
That's my guy.

02:43.447 --> 02:45.180
Craig was miserable when
you weren't interested.

02:45.181 --> 02:47.382
Now look. He's got Robert Redford.

02:47.383 --> 02:49.551
Shows you there is a God.

02:49.552 --> 02:52.087
- How's John?
- John?

02:52.088 --> 02:54.456
- John.
- John? Oh, John.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.725
No, I'm with Gregory now.

02:56.726 --> 02:58.827
We're celebrating our
15-month anniversary.

02:58.828 --> 03:01.363
15? That's a long time for you, Mickey.

03:01.364 --> 03:04.032
Oh, please, we're lovers
and we live together.

03:04.033 --> 03:05.933
It's not like we're
faithful to each other, too.

03:05.934 --> 03:09.103
He's not even Jewish. Don't tell my rabbi.

03:12.308 --> 03:14.976
- My God.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.611
<i>(Music playing)He He Hey,</i>

03:17.612 --> 03:20.481
Why do you even come here anymore?

03:20.482 --> 03:21.916
We don't want you.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.751
(Men laughing)

03:23.752 --> 03:26.587
You made us look terrible in your novel.

03:26.588 --> 03:28.856
Look around you. Sex is liberating.

03:28.857 --> 03:32.126
<i>All I said was having so much
sex makes finding love impossible.</i>

03:32.127 --> 03:34.961
Do not put your failure to find someone

03:34.962 --> 03:37.898
- on the rest of us.
- Bruce: Neddy!

03:37.899 --> 03:39.366
- Ow!
- Oh, jeez.

03:39.367 --> 03:42.169
(Coughing)

03:46.541 --> 03:48.342
Oh, God.

04:00.121 --> 04:02.122
<i>Hey, what happened?</i>

04:02.123 --> 04:04.024
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

04:04.025 --> 04:05.959
Just got a little lightheaded.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.860
I got myself up. I'm fine.

04:07.861 --> 04:12.164
I just got a little dizzy.

04:12.165 --> 04:14.834
He seemed okay.

07:21.682 --> 07:23.817
I sold you a ceramic pig once

07:23.818 --> 07:26.853
at Maison France on Bleecker Street.

07:26.854 --> 07:28.855
I'm Sanford.

07:28.856 --> 07:30.490
Yes, I remember.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.526
Somebody I was friends
with then collected pigs

07:32.527 --> 07:35.829
and you had the biggest pig I'd
ever seen outside a real pig.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.531
(Chuckles)

07:41.635 --> 07:43.369
They just keep getting bigger

07:43.370 --> 07:45.438
<i>and won't go away.</i>

07:46.673 --> 07:48.874
I'm her 20th case.

07:49.876 --> 07:51.945
And six of them are dead.

07:59.986 --> 08:01.620
<i>(Door opens)</i>

08:01.621 --> 08:03.556
Hey, Ned. Won't be a minute.

08:03.557 --> 08:05.624
Hey, Buzzy. I didn't know you worked here.

08:11.064 --> 08:13.599
<i>- (Faint whirring)
- Woman: Who are you?</i>

08:13.600 --> 08:17.402
Uh, Ned Weeks. I spoke to
you after the "Times" article.

08:19.072 --> 08:20.305
Come in. Take your clothes off.

08:20.306 --> 08:22.607
I only came to ask some questions.

08:26.145 --> 08:27.812
You are gay, aren't you?

08:27.813 --> 08:29.848
Yes.

08:29.849 --> 08:31.483
Take your clothes off. Don't be nervous.

08:31.484 --> 08:34.284
I've seen more men than you have.

08:37.857 --> 08:40.424
<i>Doctor: To answer all of
your questions, I don't know.</i>

08:40.424 --> 08:44.028
<i>I've never seen or heard
of anything like this.</i>

08:44.029 --> 08:45.730
Have you had any of the symptoms?

08:45.731 --> 08:47.898
Most of the shit the "Times" said...

08:47.899 --> 08:50.001
amoebas, gonorrhea, hepatitis.

08:50.002 --> 08:52.603
You don't know what it's been
like since the sexual revolution.

08:52.604 --> 08:54.372
What makes you think I don't?

08:54.373 --> 08:57.708
Any fever, night sweats, weight loss?

08:57.709 --> 09:00.177
Don't I wish. No.

09:00.178 --> 09:02.913
And purple lesions? Open your mouth.

09:04.148 --> 09:06.449
It's a cancer.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.785
There's a strange reaction
in the immune system.

09:08.786 --> 09:11.454
It's collapsed. Won't fight.

09:11.455 --> 09:13.590
So the diseases most of my
patients are coming down with

09:13.591 --> 09:16.326
are brought on by germs
that wouldn't hurt a baby.

09:18.295 --> 09:19.295
Tick wlish.

09:19.296 --> 09:21.273
At least not a baby in
New York City anyway.

09:21.274 --> 09:24.367
The immune system is the
system we know the least about.

09:28.539 --> 09:30.806
So where's this big
mouth I hear you've got?

09:30.807 --> 09:33.076
- Is big mouth a symptom?
- No.

09:33.077 --> 09:34.911
It's a cure.

09:34.912 --> 09:37.146
This seems to only be happening to gay men.

09:37.147 --> 09:40.349
Buzzy says you are well-known
in the gay community

09:40.350 --> 09:42.752
<i>and not afraid to say what you think.</i>

09:42.753 --> 09:45.087
I can't find any gay leaders

09:45.088 --> 09:48.824
and I call gay organizations,
no one ever calls me back.

09:48.825 --> 09:52.428
Dr. Brookner, no one with half a
brain gets involved with gay politics.

09:52.429 --> 09:54.763
- There's no room for criticism.
- What's your criticism?

09:54.764 --> 09:56.231
I hate that we play victim

09:56.232 --> 09:57.999
when many of us, most of us, don't have to.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.834
Then you're exactly what's needed now.

09:59.835 --> 10:01.937
Maybe they're just waiting
for someone to lead them.

10:01.938 --> 10:03.539
I don't want to lead them.

10:03.540 --> 10:06.108
What exactly are you
trying to get me to do?

10:06.109 --> 10:08.243
Tell gay men to stop having sex.

10:10.345 --> 10:13.014
Do you think that this cancer
is sexually transmitted?

10:13.015 --> 10:14.816
I think it is, yes.

10:14.817 --> 10:17.251
Can I prity it yet? No.

10:19.354 --> 10:21.623
Do you realize that you're talking about

10:21.624 --> 10:23.291
millions of men

10:23.292 --> 10:25.226
who have singled out promiscuity

10:25.227 --> 10:27.495
as their principal political agenda?

10:27.496 --> 10:30.798
<i>- How do you deal with that?
- Tell them they may die.</i>

10:30.799 --> 10:34.102
- Where?
- Down the hall. Down the hall!

10:34.103 --> 10:37.037
It's not that simple. It's
more complicated than that.

10:37.038 --> 10:38.839
They think sex is all they have.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.075
Mr. Weeks, if having sex can kill you,

10:41.076 --> 10:43.376
doesn't anyone with half
a brain stop fucking?

10:47.482 --> 10:49.984
You can go. I'm not finding
what I'm looking for here.

10:49.985 --> 10:51.485
<i>(Elevator bell rings)</i>

10:51.486 --> 10:54.287
<i>- Bruce: Where?
- Mickey: Open up!</i>

10:54.288 --> 10:56.223
- Where? Where?
- Right in that room.

10:56.224 --> 10:59.126
Just put him up on the table.

10:59.127 --> 11:01.161
Up here. Let's find a pulse.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.163
Baby, easy.

11:03.164 --> 11:05.698
- Be still.
- Buzzy: Can you tell me what happened?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.900
We were meeting him outside.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.802
We turned the corner and he just collapsed.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.639
<i>- (Horns honking)
- (Panting)</i>

11:12.640 --> 11:15.308
(Tires screech)

11:15.309 --> 11:16.809
Jesus!

11:16.810 --> 11:19.178
Hey, get the fuck out of the street!

11:20.648 --> 11:23.149
- (Gasping)
- Baby!

11:23.150 --> 11:25.685
- Oh, my God!
- Help!

11:25.686 --> 11:28.320
<i>- (Sobbing)
- (Siren blaring)</i>

11:30.124 --> 11:31.724
- Who's the lover?
- I am, ma'am.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.959
- What's your name?
- Bruce Niles.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.395
Brookner. I need a room immediately.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.531
Niles, you were Reinhardt's boyfriend.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.998
Yes, ma'am. How do you know that?

11:39.999 --> 11:42.301
He died three weeks ago.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.472
<i>(Sirens echoing)</i>

11:47.641 --> 11:49.808
<i>(Door slams)</i>

12:15.133 --> 12:17.802
Wouldn't even let me say goodbye.

12:18.937 --> 12:22.673
Not even let me kiss him goodbye.

12:24.209 --> 12:26.510
He's dead?

12:34.319 --> 12:36.286
So sorry.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.429
It can happen this fast?

12:46.431 --> 12:48.665
It just did.

12:57.742 --> 13:00.944
We have to do something.

13:00.945 --> 13:03.279
No one else will.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.982
<i>Mickey: What are we supposed to do?</i>

13:10.420 --> 13:13.623
<i>Morton: You make these assumptions
on the basis of 46 cases.</i>

13:13.624 --> 13:17.159
You wanted to know what I
think. This is what I think.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.295
You are all going to infect each other.

13:19.296 --> 13:21.464
(Clamoring)

13:24.968 --> 13:27.603
Now only a few of you have.

13:27.604 --> 13:30.639
Unfortunately, we can't
tell yet which ones.

13:30.640 --> 13:34.209
Long before we isolated
the hepatitis viruses,

13:34.210 --> 13:36.779
we knew about the diseases they caused

13:36.780 --> 13:38.580
<i>and how they got around.</i>

13:38.581 --> 13:40.482
Where are the medical
journals? The "Times"?

13:40.483 --> 13:43.752
I sent my first reports to the
medical journals over a year ago.

13:43.753 --> 13:46.388
Excuse me, how do you know
what you're looking for,

13:46.389 --> 13:49.157
real quick, if you don't
know what you're looking for?

13:49.158 --> 13:50.958
<i>I'm sorry, I guess that's a dumb question.</i>

13:50.959 --> 13:53.561
No, it isn't. It's the
smartest question of all

13:53.562 --> 13:55.363
and the hardest one to answer.

13:55.364 --> 13:58.065
Doesn't common sense tell you
you should cool it for a while?

13:58.066 --> 14:00.134
(Clamoring, laughter)

14:00.135 --> 14:02.036
<i>Ned: Why not?</i>

14:02.037 --> 14:05.539
That doesn't leave much to look forward to.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.908
What if it turns out that you're wrong?

14:06.909 --> 14:08.609
Let her speak!

14:08.610 --> 14:12.146
The worst that could happen would
be that you cooled it for a while.

14:12.147 --> 14:14.615
- (Clamoring)
- No, excuse me. Excuse me.

14:14.616 --> 14:17.785
Excuse me. That is not the
worst that will have happened.

14:17.786 --> 14:19.920
- (Clamoring)
- Guys will become frightened of sex.

14:19.921 --> 14:21.455
We will lose our self-respect

14:21.456 --> 14:23.290
that we fought very, very hard for.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.025
We will be scapegoated worse than ever.

14:25.026 --> 14:26.627
The world will think we're carriers

14:26.628 --> 14:28.729
and the Moral Majority will
have even more of a field day.

14:28.730 --> 14:31.298
(Group clamoring)

14:31.299 --> 14:33.500
I am not coming back until
this bitch on wheels is gone.

14:33.501 --> 14:37.270
Wait! I see more cases each
week than the week before.

14:37.271 --> 14:39.339
Half of all my patients die.

14:40.842 --> 14:42.275
Okay, I hope she winds this up,

14:42.276 --> 14:44.444
'cause I've got a tiny
little orgy in New Rochelle.

14:44.445 --> 14:46.412
Where's the health
department? Where's the mayor?

14:46.413 --> 14:49.415
- Shut the fuck up, John.
- Oh, you shut the fuck up, hon.

14:49.416 --> 14:51.116
What are the numbers?

14:51.117 --> 14:53.853
<i>(Voices overlapping)</i>

15:01.862 --> 15:03.830
Is every gay meeting like this?

15:05.466 --> 15:08.100
Half these people just
showed up to get laid.

15:10.003 --> 15:11.971
<i>Ned: Quiet! Quiet!</i>

15:11.972 --> 15:15.407
We're starting a group. We're
starting a health crisis group.

15:15.408 --> 15:17.042
We're gonna meet here again.

15:17.043 --> 15:19.278
<i>Man: Next time, bring some fucking food.</i>

15:19.279 --> 15:21.413
<i>Tommy: Hey, hey, hey. That's not nice.</i>

15:25.718 --> 15:28.119
Welcome to gay politics.

15:59.384 --> 16:02.453
Yeah, I'm very late for an important
meeting with Craig Claiborne.

16:02.454 --> 16:04.555
He's expecting me.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.427
(Phones ringing, typewriter keys clicking)

16:20.104 --> 16:22.339
- Hi, Felix Turner.
- And you are?

16:22.340 --> 16:25.108
My name's Ned Weeks.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.177
You're very cute.

16:27.178 --> 16:30.279
You caught me at a rough moment, all right?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.214
I have a deadline. The
First Lady is coming to town.

16:32.215 --> 16:34.818
I've been told you're
gay and you might be able

16:34.819 --> 16:37.053
to help me get some vital
information in the "Times."

16:37.054 --> 16:39.722
You've "been told"? And
who was it that told you?

16:39.723 --> 16:42.826
Oh, honey, everybody's talking about it.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.028
(Chuckles)

16:46.029 --> 16:47.529
Why does everyone gay

16:47.530 --> 16:49.198
think that I run "The New York Times"?

16:49.199 --> 16:51.167
I can't help you with this.

16:51.168 --> 16:53.336
Sorry to hear that. What
would you suggest I do?

16:53.337 --> 16:55.704
Take your pick. I got 23 parties,

16:55.705 --> 16:58.107
37 new restaurants, 12 new discos.

16:58.108 --> 17:01.110
Listen, I can't get anyone
here to write another article.

17:01.111 --> 17:02.878
I've talked to half a dozen reporters

17:02.879 --> 17:04.378
and the guy who worked on the first piece.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.815
"Mr. Leather"? Yeah, no.

17:06.816 --> 17:09.550
No one here will write
about it and I can't.

17:09.551 --> 17:11.819
Look, we're very compartmentalized.

17:11.820 --> 17:14.455
You wouldn't want science to
write about sweaters, would you?

17:14.457 --> 17:16.257
It's a very peculiar
feeling having to go out

17:16.258 --> 17:18.425
and seek support from a
straight world for something gay.

17:20.262 --> 17:22.030
(Whispering) I wouldn't know about that.

17:22.031 --> 17:24.432
I just write about gay
designers and gay discos

17:24.433 --> 17:26.767
and gay chefs and gay
models and gay rock stars

17:26.768 --> 17:28.936
and gay celebrities and gay everything.

17:28.937 --> 17:31.606
I just don't call them gay.

17:31.607 --> 17:34.009
Isn't it time you start?

17:34.010 --> 17:36.076
(Scoffs)

17:36.077 --> 17:38.513
- Look, I really do have a deadline,
- Hmm.

17:38.514 --> 17:41.048
And you wouldn't want me to get fired.

17:41.049 --> 17:43.518
Would you?

17:43.519 --> 17:46.286
Guys like you give me a pain in the ass.

17:48.957 --> 17:51.125
- You in the book?
- Yes.

17:56.998 --> 17:59.500
<i>Ned: Hi, guys. Give to gay cancer?</i>

17:59.501 --> 18:02.102
<i>Hi, give to gay cancer? No?</i>

18:02.103 --> 18:03.303
Hi. Give to gay cancer?

18:03.304 --> 18:04.905
Hi, sir...

18:04.906 --> 18:07.074
Hi, give to gay cancer? There's
a cancer in the gay community.

18:07.075 --> 18:08.542
Can you give to gay cancer?

18:08.543 --> 18:10.777
There's a... there's a crisis
in our community right now.

18:10.778 --> 18:12.078
We could really use...

18:12.079 --> 18:13.847
<i>We could use a little help. Anything? No?</i>

18:13.848 --> 18:15.515
I think you could be a
little less aggressive.

18:15.516 --> 18:17.216
Less aggressive? We've tried that.

18:17.217 --> 18:19.419
Can you give to cancer in our community?

18:21.321 --> 18:23.356
<i>Hi, give to gay cancer?</i>

18:23.357 --> 18:25.258
<i>Hi, give to gay cancer?</i>

18:42.108 --> 18:45.110
(Surf rumbles)

18:58.524 --> 19:00.325
(Sniffles)

19:28.821 --> 19:32.990
It's funny. My mother sent flowers.

19:32.991 --> 19:35.726
And I had never told her I was gay.

19:35.727 --> 19:37.894
I just told her that Craig had died.

19:39.731 --> 19:42.799
I think she knew.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.069
I think somehow mothers always know.

19:57.649 --> 20:01.051
Doesn't spending $5 million
on a house frighten you?

20:01.052 --> 20:04.787
Scared the shit out of me even
having you handling my finances.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.722
You can have a house anytime you want.

20:06.723 --> 20:09.425
Which reminds me, your
account needs more money.

20:09.426 --> 20:12.228
You're not doing too badly.

20:12.229 --> 20:14.130
I miss you being in the movie business.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.666
- I like movies.
- Do I detect a note of approval

20:16.667 --> 20:19.169
from the big brother
that called me "Lemon"?

20:20.237 --> 20:21.503
I don't want a house.

20:21.504 --> 20:22.738
Then why have you been searching

20:22.739 --> 20:24.273
in the country for so long for?

20:24.274 --> 20:27.376
- No fun living in it alone.
- This Bruce...

20:28.444 --> 20:29.679
is he someone you're seeing?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.947
I see him, he doesn't see me.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.251
Ben...

20:36.252 --> 20:38.220
could your law firm take this on for free?

20:38.221 --> 20:40.289
What's it called? Pro bono?

20:40.290 --> 20:42.924
We started an organization, I
told you there's this new disease.

20:42.925 --> 20:45.960
Now this sounds like just another
excuse to keep from writing.

20:45.961 --> 20:47.729
Why can't you just say "yes"?

20:47.730 --> 20:49.764
I told you, because we have a committee

20:49.765 --> 20:51.466
that decides that kind of thing.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.634
But you're the senior partner

20:52.635 --> 20:54.769
and I'm your brother.

20:54.770 --> 20:58.173
Hey, Mario. How's Homer?

21:01.944 --> 21:04.579
If you're not gonna help, I'm
gonna have to find somebody else.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.881
- Well, you're more than free to do that.
- I don't want to do that.

21:06.882 --> 21:09.383
I want my big brother's fancy, famous,

21:09.384 --> 21:11.018
big-time, major law firm

21:11.019 --> 21:12.886
to be the first straight New York law firm

21:12.887 --> 21:14.522
to do pro bono work for a gay cause.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.824
I'd be real proud of that and

21:18.594 --> 21:20.728
I'll ask my partners'
approval at the next meeting.

21:20.729 --> 21:24.498
I'll lobby them. You don't
sound like a very sure vote.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.208
Okay.

21:39.147 --> 21:41.148
You're getting better at it.

21:44.252 --> 21:46.486
<i>Dr. Brookner: I'm seeing three
to four new patients a week.</i>

21:46.487 --> 21:50.357
<i>I've got seven in ICU. The whole
hospital only has room for 30.</i>

21:50.358 --> 21:51.858
I've had to admit some of them under

21:51.859 --> 21:53.593
other illnesses. That's a no-no.

21:53.594 --> 21:56.129
I've got 20 in private
rooms they can't afford.

21:56.130 --> 21:58.898
<i>Okay, what about the guys who
don't have health insurance...</i>

21:58.899 --> 22:01.333
- artists, actors?
- I've got eight of them in another ward

22:01.334 --> 22:02.902
where I shouldn't put them.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.114
Why don't you wear gloves and a face mask?

22:15.115 --> 22:17.883
Never have and I never will.

22:17.884 --> 22:20.719
And I'm still here.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.054
Why is all the food sitting
outside their rooms like this?

22:23.055 --> 22:24.790
- It's getting cold.
- It's always cold

22:24.791 --> 22:27.926
because the appropriate staff
won't bring it into the rooms,

22:27.927 --> 22:31.029
so it sits and rots
until one of my staff can.

22:32.365 --> 22:35.133
<i>Sanford: Right there. Yeah, by the water.</i>

22:35.134 --> 22:36.634
<i>Yeah, right through the tunnel.</i>

22:36.635 --> 22:39.237
Take the tunnel. We'll take the book back.

22:40.339 --> 22:42.440
I know him. Can I go inside with you?

22:44.944 --> 22:47.578
Only if you wear all the protective shit.

22:47.579 --> 22:49.681
If you don't, I don't.

22:53.619 --> 22:56.187
<i>Sanford: Over there. Go the other way.</i>

22:56.188 --> 22:58.122
<i>No, are you listening to me?</i>

22:58.123 --> 22:59.857
<i>Are you listening to me? Go back.</i>

22:59.858 --> 23:02.460
<i>- Hi, Sanford.
- You see that? Take the tunnel.</i>

23:02.461 --> 23:04.261
Go ahead, drive straight through.

23:04.262 --> 23:05.663
How we doing, soldier?

23:05.664 --> 23:08.398
I want my dog. Can you
please bring me my dog?

23:08.399 --> 23:10.901
<i>He won't be able to live without me.</i>

23:10.902 --> 23:13.938
I want my dog. I want my dog.

23:13.939 --> 23:15.706
<i>Go ahead. That's right.</i>

23:15.707 --> 23:18.575
<i>Oh, good. Good. No. Take the book back.</i>

23:18.576 --> 23:20.444
<i>Right there. Pull hard.</i>

23:20.445 --> 23:22.146
<i>Right there.</i>

23:22.147 --> 23:24.147
<i>Can you please bring me my dog?</i>

23:24.148 --> 23:25.849
<i>He won't know how to live without me.</i>

23:25.850 --> 23:27.951
(TV buzzing)

23:30.521 --> 23:33.056
Don't bother.

23:33.057 --> 23:36.460
Who's going to bring me my dog?

23:36.461 --> 23:39.829
<i>His name is Skip. He'll
come when you call him.</i>

23:39.830 --> 23:42.131
Please. (Gasping)

23:44.401 --> 23:46.802
I miss him.

23:46.803 --> 23:49.572
(Sobbing)

23:53.277 --> 23:55.278
<i>I miss him.</i>

23:57.146 --> 23:59.348
Can you imagine this at 19?

23:59.349 --> 24:02.885
Your first boyfriend you were
gonna spend your whole life with.

24:05.355 --> 24:07.523
(Door opens)

24:10.193 --> 24:11.660
<i>- Excuse me.
- Man: Yeah.</i>

24:11.661 --> 24:13.795
You're the TV guy?

24:13.796 --> 24:15.830
Please go to room 407 and fix it.

24:15.831 --> 24:18.566
- No I'm not gonna do that.
- Fix the TV. It's your fucking job.

24:18.567 --> 24:21.536
My union says I don't gotta risk my life

24:21.537 --> 24:23.505
for some contagious fairy.

24:23.506 --> 24:26.375
If I have to go in there,
then I fucking quit.

24:35.317 --> 24:38.486
<i>So what exactly has your side been doing?</i>

24:40.890 --> 24:44.592
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

24:47.095 --> 24:49.096
(Music playing)

24:52.935 --> 24:54.936
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

24:58.206 --> 25:00.207
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

25:03.377 --> 25:05.879
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.148
Thanks.

25:08.149 --> 25:09.783
Want some of this? A beer?

25:09.784 --> 25:11.885
Oh, beer's fine. Thanks.

25:14.489 --> 25:16.389
Oh, hey, pooch.

25:16.390 --> 25:20.226
- Her name's Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.528
You know, I really used to like high-tech,

25:22.529 --> 25:24.630
but I'm tired of it now.

25:24.631 --> 25:27.267
I think I want chintz back again.

25:27.268 --> 25:29.235
Don't be insulted.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.903
I'm not.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.774
I want chintz back again, too.

25:34.775 --> 25:37.944
So, here we are.

25:37.945 --> 25:39.445
Two fellows who want chintz back again.

25:39.446 --> 25:41.581
I guess this really is a date.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.653
I'm starving.

25:47.654 --> 25:49.489
- You glad I'm here?
- Oh...

25:49.490 --> 25:51.123
I'm pleased as punch you're here.

25:51.124 --> 25:53.459
You're very good-looking.
What are you doing here?

25:53.460 --> 25:54.893
You think you're bad-looking or something?

25:54.894 --> 25:57.196
(Groans) Where you from?

25:57.197 --> 25:59.831
I'm from Oklahoma.

25:59.832 --> 26:02.801
I left home at 18, put myself through...

26:02.802 --> 26:05.237
what, you wanna dance?

26:05.238 --> 26:08.306
Put myself through college.

26:08.307 --> 26:11.409
<i>My dad worked at the refinery in West Tulsa</i>

26:11.410 --> 26:13.411
and my mom was a waitress.

26:13.412 --> 26:15.213
Had a luncheonette in Walgreens.

26:17.984 --> 26:20.752
It's amazing, isn't it? How
a kid comes out of all that

26:20.753 --> 26:22.521
and wind up on the "Times,"

26:22.522 --> 26:24.955
dictating taste and
style to the entire world.

26:24.956 --> 26:27.791
And we were just starting
to talk so nicely.

26:27.792 --> 26:29.193
Talking's not my problem.

26:29.194 --> 26:31.262
- Shutting up's my problem.
- (Chuckling)

26:31.263 --> 26:33.398
Why do you write all that
fancy ball gown bullshit?

26:33.399 --> 26:36.200
I bet you gobble it up every day.

26:37.836 --> 26:40.604
I know 10 people who have died.

26:40.605 --> 26:43.273
When I came to you, it was only one.

26:43.274 --> 26:46.577
I'm sorry.

26:46.578 --> 26:48.679
Is that why you agreed to this date?

26:55.954 --> 26:58.855
Fork on the left.

26:58.856 --> 27:00.524
Knife on the right.

27:03.428 --> 27:04.861
Did you know that Hitler's Final Solution

27:04.862 --> 27:06.963
to eliminate the Polish Jews

27:06.964 --> 27:09.299
was first mentioned in the
"Times"? It was on page 28.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.301
On page 6 of the "Washington Post."

27:11.302 --> 27:14.037
They are both owned by
Jews. Their very own people.

27:14.038 --> 27:17.073
Scholars are finally writing honestly
about it and it's damning to everyone.

27:17.074 --> 27:20.810
Where is the Christian churches?
The Pope? Churchill? Roosevelt?

27:20.811 --> 27:22.812
A few words from any of them
would have put Hitler on notice.

27:22.813 --> 27:26.515
Dachau was open in 1933.
Where the fuck was everybody?

27:27.952 --> 27:31.887
This is turning out to be
a very romantic evening.

27:31.888 --> 27:33.389
You've never had a lover, have you?

27:33.390 --> 27:35.657
I suppose you've had quite a few.

27:35.658 --> 27:37.259
I had a very good one.

27:37.260 --> 27:40.896
For a number of years, thank you.

27:40.897 --> 27:44.933
He was older than I was and
he found someone younger.

27:44.934 --> 27:49.004
- You looking for a father?
- No, I'm not looking for a father. God.

27:49.005 --> 27:50.839
<i>You're relentless.</i>

27:59.548 --> 28:01.316
Okay.

28:01.317 --> 28:02.985
That's yours.

28:02.986 --> 28:05.520
Everybody had a million reasons
for not getting involved.

28:05.521 --> 28:08.490
The American Jews knew
exactly what was going on.

28:08.491 --> 28:11.926
Could you imagine if every Jew had
marched on Washington proudly, huh?

28:11.927 --> 28:13.228
Ned.

28:15.197 --> 28:18.266

29:35.274 --> 29:36.441
(Grunts)

29:36.442 --> 29:38.210
I asked what you did and
you said something like

29:38.211 --> 29:41.580
you "tried a number of things" and...

29:41.581 --> 29:43.682
I asked if that had included love.

29:46.018 --> 29:49.687
That's when you said, "I have
to get up early in the morning."

29:49.688 --> 29:50.955
Yeah.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.261
<i>Men do not naturally not love.</i>

29:59.832 --> 30:01.933
They learn not to.

30:04.802 --> 30:07.271

30:09.374 --> 30:11.007
How could I not remember you?

30:11.008 --> 30:12.909
(Chuckles) I don't know.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.811
It was very dark.

30:18.049 --> 30:20.483

30:22.220 --> 30:24.121
Yeah.

31:10.966 --> 31:13.101
(panting, moaning)

31:18.073 --> 31:20.842
When I was going to Yale, I thought
I was the only gay guy there.

31:20.843 --> 31:23.111
Swear to God.

31:23.112 --> 31:26.414
<i>Went to the shrink who tried to change me.</i>

31:26.415 --> 31:28.449
Now they have "Gay Weeks" there

31:28.450 --> 31:30.551
and they throw the best dances of anyone.

31:32.221 --> 31:34.522
Imagine being able to dance cheek to cheek

31:34.523 --> 31:37.959
with your boyfriend during
your bright college days.

31:43.332 --> 31:45.766
Did you ever sleep with a woman?

31:50.605 --> 31:52.039
What?

31:52.040 --> 31:55.343
Her name was... Delilah.

31:55.344 --> 31:57.712
Delilah?

31:57.713 --> 31:59.346
She was...

31:59.347 --> 32:02.249
a stand-in on this movie I wrote.

32:02.250 --> 32:05.986
She was very nice and pretty.

32:05.987 --> 32:09.022
Always smiling at me.

32:09.023 --> 32:12.792
So I... I asked a straight
friend to explain it to me.

32:12.793 --> 32:16.730
I thought I knew, but I
just wanted to make sure.

32:16.731 --> 32:19.499
And I had her to dinner and...

32:19.500 --> 32:22.702
afterwards, what I deemed
to be a suitable moment

32:22.703 --> 32:25.004
because I had been communicating
with it down there...

32:25.005 --> 32:28.040
"Are you ready? Are you
absolutely certain you're ready?"

32:28.041 --> 32:31.710
And when it appeared
"Abercrombie" was ready.

32:31.711 --> 32:34.180
I picked her up, very Rhett Butler,

32:34.181 --> 32:36.015
and carried her to my bed.

32:36.016 --> 32:38.918
- Where I couldn't get it up.
- Oh!

32:38.919 --> 32:40.953
- But...
- I can certainly relate to that.

32:40.954 --> 32:42.621
In the middle of the
night, I woke up with this

32:42.622 --> 32:46.825
gigantic erection, God... God knows how.

32:46.826 --> 32:50.796
So I shake her, shouting, "Please
stick it in for me, Delilah."

32:50.797 --> 32:54.032
I was afraid of it going
away before I could...

32:54.033 --> 32:58.470
while I was hunting for
the right place to put it.

32:58.471 --> 33:02.073
She did and I did, and Abercrombie did.

33:02.074 --> 33:05.576
- (laughing)
- Ugh...

33:07.013 --> 33:10.115
The next morning I woke up

33:10.116 --> 33:13.618
<i>and I, who had been under
the spell of this shrink</i>

33:13.619 --> 33:15.820
who was determined to change me,

33:15.821 --> 33:17.688
rushed into his office.

33:17.689 --> 33:20.091
<i>And I, who had been fucking with fellows</i>

33:20.092 --> 33:21.826
since the 7th grade,

33:21.827 --> 33:25.129
hysterically, at the age of 32 proclaimed,

33:25.130 --> 33:27.465
"Dr. Gillespie, I'm no longer a virgin!"

33:27.466 --> 33:30.835
Oh, aw.

33:41.046 --> 33:45.316
Henry: He's in here. I
think we'll catch him.

33:45.317 --> 33:46.483
All right.

33:46.484 --> 33:48.419
So, I just go over and say hello?

33:48.420 --> 33:51.288
I told him I invited you
and we went to Yale together.

33:51.289 --> 33:54.624
It's my farewell party. What's he gonna do?

33:54.625 --> 33:56.392
Let's go.

33:56.393 --> 33:57.694
Ahem.

33:57.695 --> 33:59.996
His Honor would like you to get lost.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.866
- This is my friend, Ned Weeks.
- Yeah, we know who he is.

34:04.134 --> 34:06.102
Mr. Mayor! We need your help!

34:06.103 --> 34:08.572
There's this new disease.
You must have heard about it.

34:08.572 --> 34:11.373
We need your help badly!
Get off me, you pigs!

34:11.375 --> 34:12.875
This is America!

34:12.876 --> 34:15.143
Mr. Mayor! We're dying!

34:15.145 --> 34:17.913
(Papers rustling)

34:17.914 --> 34:22.452
Okay, this is what Ned
wrote for us to send out.

34:22.453 --> 34:25.588
"I am sick of guys moaning
that giving up careless sex..."

34:25.589 --> 34:27.422
Ned: "...until this blows
over is worse than death.

34:27.422 --> 34:30.225
<i>I am sick of guys that can
only think with their cocks.</i>

34:30.226 --> 34:33.929

34:39.835 --> 34:41.036
You're crazy.

34:41.036 --> 34:42.771
Am I, Bruce? Do you really think so?

34:42.772 --> 34:45.407
Aren't we supposed to
elect a president tonight?

34:45.408 --> 34:47.775
We can't tell people how
to live their lives, Ned.

34:47.775 --> 34:50.512
The entire gay political
movement is fucking.

34:50.513 --> 34:52.679
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:52.681 --> 34:54.916
You know, I'm very interested in starting
up some sort of services for the patients.

34:54.917 --> 34:56.717
We've gotta start talking about them.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.421
Also, there are a lot of
very scared people out there

34:59.422 --> 35:00.855
and they're desperate for information.

35:00.856 --> 35:03.090
I'd like to start a hotline.

35:03.091 --> 35:04.258
Who's he?

35:04.259 --> 35:06.227
Ooh, he does not know who I am yet.

35:06.228 --> 35:08.696
His name is Tommy Boatwright.

35:08.697 --> 35:11.432
<i>In real life, he is a
hospital administrator.</i>

35:11.433 --> 35:14.101
Uh... he's here to help
and he's a Southern bitch.

35:14.102 --> 35:16.237
- (laughter)
- Mr. Boatwright, Bruce Niles.

35:16.238 --> 35:17.771
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

35:17.772 --> 35:18.939
<i>Tommy: You're very handsome.</i>

35:24.646 --> 35:26.847

35:26.848 --> 35:28.482
I'm looking. What am I not seeing?

35:28.483 --> 35:31.318
- Keep looking.
- What we put for our return address.

35:31.319 --> 35:33.720
<i>Do you mean because the word
"gay" is on the envelope?</i>

35:33.721 --> 35:36.657
Fucking A, yes. Instead
of just our initials.

35:36.658 --> 35:38.759
- We can't send these out.
- Excuse me.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.561
If we want anybody to
show up for this dance,

35:40.562 --> 35:42.195
we have to get these out tonight.

35:42.196 --> 35:44.264
We need to go through and scratch out
the word "gay" with a Magic Marker.

35:44.265 --> 35:45.999
Oh, honey, 10,000 times?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.935
<i>Ned: Bruce, I have sympathy

- (All groaning)

35:59.046 --> 36:00.813
You don't expect me to take you seriously.

36:00.814 --> 36:03.249
- Yes, I do, Ned.
- Okay, ladies, behave.

36:03.250 --> 36:06.819
Look, it's getting late and we
still haven't elected a president.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.987
Neddy...

36:07.988 --> 36:10.723
I think that it should be Bruce.

36:10.724 --> 36:13.966
Everybody knows him everybody
likes him and everybodt...

36:13.967 --> 36:15.854

Street and Fire Island,

36:20.934 --> 36:23.569
they'll just... they'll feel a little
bit more comfortable following him.

36:23.570 --> 36:25.737
- Just like high school.
- All: Yes!

41:23.260 --> 41:24.593

pass for white people.

I love Albert.

41:38.775 --> 41:40.442
Bruce, look at me.

41:40.443 --> 41:42.510
I love him.

41:42.511 --> 41:45.380
Albert's gonna make it.

41:48.117 --> 41:50.618
What if he doesn't?

41:53.956 --> 41:56.024

42:49.977 --> 42:52.211
- I'm all right.
- Okay.

43:04.524 --> 43:06.057
When I finally get you where I want you,

43:06.058 --> 43:08.159
I don't want you anymore.

Hey, Bruce, I'm in love too.

49:27.662 --> 49:30.929
Well, I'm glad you asked me that question.

49:30.930 --> 49:33.632
What do I think? I know that the government

49:33.633 --> 49:37.236
is intentionally ignoring this epidemic.

49:37.237 --> 49:40.339
You're accusing the
government of the United States

49:40.340 --> 49:43.609
of a conspiracy to murder all gay men?

49:48.982 --> 49:51.350
Yes. Yes, you can say that.

49:51.351 --> 49:53.385
Yes, Sarabeth, I am. Yes.

49:53.386 --> 49:56.088
That is a powerful accusation.

49:56.089 --> 49:58.790
This is an epidemic and it's being ignored

49:58.791 --> 50:00.292
by the United States government.

50:00.293 --> 50:02.294
- Intentionally?
- Intentionally being ignored.

50:02.295 --> 50:04.295
This is a national emergency.

50:04.296 --> 50:06.130
This is an epidemic. It's a plague.

50:06.131 --> 50:09.166
You can't go on national TV and
accuse the government of murder, Ned.

50:09.167 --> 50:11.969
- Why not?
- Because one day we're gonna get money,

50:11.970 --> 50:13.389
research grants.

50:13.390 --> 50:15.306
Congress still hasn't appropriated a dime.

50:15.307 --> 50:16.941
The mayor's still... on and on!

50:16.942 --> 50:20.211
Ned, when you go public, you have no
right to speak for this organization

50:20.212 --> 50:24.382
unless we have approved what
you have to say in advance.

50:24.383 --> 50:26.984
You know, in point of fact, you aren't
even an officer of this organization

50:26.985 --> 50:29.186
<i>and you shouldn't be
speaking for us at all.</i>

50:29.187 --> 50:32.589
<i>Well, thank you for
sharing that with me, Dick.</i>

50:35.260 --> 50:37.594
<i>(Theme music playing)</i>

50:45.837 --> 50:47.571
Why do you think the city has been so slow

50:47.572 --> 50:50.507
to acknowledge and deal
with this emergency?

50:50.508 --> 50:52.643
Well, you're implying that
the city has recognized

50:52.644 --> 50:55.145
and acknowledged this
emergency, Malcolm. It has not.

50:55.146 --> 50:57.047
Why not, do you think?

50:57.048 --> 50:59.282
Because the mayor's gay
and he's scared shitless

50:59.283 --> 51:00.984
out of his panties it'll blow his cover.

51:05.889 --> 51:07.523
You can't tell me what to say
when I'm speaking for myself.

51:07.524 --> 51:09.359
Bullshit. They all know you're one of us.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.960
It is totally and politically incorrect

51:10.961 --> 51:13.429
to call someone gay who does
not self-identify as being gay.

51:13.430 --> 51:15.064
I know it's been that way forever,

51:15.065 --> 51:17.433
but something different is
going on here now. We're dying.

51:17.434 --> 51:19.234
The mayor, he's a personal friend of yours.

51:19.235 --> 51:21.070
You want him to appoint you a judge.

51:21.071 --> 51:23.272
Do you have a little conflict
of interest going on here?

51:23.273 --> 51:24.907
- I told you I sent him a memo.
- When?

51:24.908 --> 51:26.408
- Through channels.
- When?

51:26.409 --> 51:28.277
- He'll answer me.
- When?!

51:28.278 --> 51:30.612
<i>There's 110 new cases this month!</i>

51:30.613 --> 51:33.182
Still no meeting with our gay mayor.

51:33.183 --> 51:35.284
No meeting with his gay assistant.

51:38.855 --> 51:41.123
What? Do I embarrass you, Bruce?

51:41.124 --> 51:43.458
Yes. You do.

51:43.459 --> 51:44.726
You get more with honey
than with vinegar, babe.

51:44.727 --> 51:46.127
God, no one's told me that one, Tommy.

51:46.128 --> 51:48.229
No, obviously, they haven't.

51:48.230 --> 51:49.965
I never believed that bullshit, anyway.

51:49.966 --> 51:51.967
We are in over our heads with
the patients we're trying to help.

51:51.968 --> 51:55.103
Tommy, will you please read
this report out loud for Ned?

51:55.104 --> 51:59.073
<i>Tommy: We have trained 25 crisis counselors</i>

51:59.074 --> 52:01.909
to help the newly diagnosed in
whatever needs that they might have.

52:01.910 --> 52:05.546
We have 12 group leaders who
meet with these counselors

52:05.547 --> 52:07.648
at least once a week to
go over their clients.

52:07.649 --> 52:09.450
<i>There are now 17 volunteer social workers,</i>

52:09.451 --> 52:12.020
psychologists and/or psychiatrists.

52:12.021 --> 52:13.654
We helped draw up 75 wills last...

52:13.655 --> 52:16.423
75, Bruce!

52:16.424 --> 52:18.125
You used to be a fighter once.

52:18.126 --> 52:21.061
- Did you like being in the Green Berets?
- Yes. I loved it.

52:21.062 --> 52:23.096
Have you completely forgotten how to fight?

52:23.097 --> 52:25.699
Don't tell me how to fight. I
just fight differently than you.

52:25.700 --> 52:27.668
- I haven't seen your way yet.
- No?

52:27.669 --> 52:30.404
Bruce... Albert may be dying.

52:30.405 --> 52:33.306
You son of a bitch! You
say another word about him!

52:33.307 --> 52:36.043
Relax.

52:36.044 --> 52:37.944
And you.

52:37.945 --> 52:40.514
You have no right being on this board

52:40.515 --> 52:42.582
<i>unless you put pressure
on your friend the mayor.</i>

52:42.583 --> 52:45.618
That's why I asked you to join us
in the first place and you know it.

52:52.927 --> 52:55.161
(Panting)

52:57.598 --> 52:59.699
- Ben: No, no, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

52:59.700 --> 53:01.434
No, you got your free
legal work from my firm.

53:01.435 --> 53:03.202
I'm not gonna be on
your board of directors.

53:03.203 --> 53:05.571
It's only for the stationery.
You don't have to do a thing.

53:05.572 --> 53:08.641
That is just an evasion. If you
thought this was a straight disease...

53:08.642 --> 53:09.919
It's got nothing to do with you being gay.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.379
What else does it have to do with?

53:12.011 --> 53:13.379
One of these days, I'm
gonna get you to agree

53:13.380 --> 53:15.581
that over 20 million men
and women in this country

53:15.582 --> 53:18.384
don't require the
services of a psychiatrist.

53:18.385 --> 53:19.685
Look, try to understand.

53:19.686 --> 53:21.887
You know, I read stuff, I see TV.

53:21.888 --> 53:23.889
Guys in leather and chains.

53:23.890 --> 53:25.657
Dresses, high heels.

53:25.658 --> 53:27.492
I say to myself, "This isn't Ned."

53:27.493 --> 53:30.295
You know the media always
dramatizes the most extreme.

53:30.296 --> 53:32.497
You guys have a dreadful image problem.

53:32.498 --> 53:33.999
That's why it's so important

53:34.000 --> 53:35.433
to have people like you supporting us.

53:35.434 --> 53:37.135
You already have your dignity.

53:37.136 --> 53:39.737
Ben: We better get to lunch.

53:39.738 --> 53:41.939
Do you? How important?

53:41.940 --> 53:43.575

53:49.148 --> 53:52.083
I don't have your support at all.

53:52.084 --> 53:54.152
In some place deep down inside you,

53:54.153 --> 53:55.419
you still think I'm sick, don't you?

53:55.420 --> 53:57.187
I think you've adjusted
to life pretty well.

53:57.188 --> 54:00.591
- All things considered.
- I saw how unhappy you were.

54:00.592 --> 54:02.192
So were you!

54:02.193 --> 54:05.930
You wound up going to shrinks,
too. We grew up side by side.

54:05.931 --> 54:08.699
We both felt the same about Mom and Pop.

54:08.700 --> 54:13.069
I'll agree to the fact that I have
any number of awful character traits,

54:13.070 --> 54:16.906
<i>but not to the fact that whatever
awful things they did to us</i>

54:16.907 --> 54:20.744
made me sick and gay while you
stayed straight and healthy.

54:20.745 --> 54:22.846
We don't all react the
same way to the thing.

54:22.847 --> 54:25.215
So you became a lawyer
and I became a writer.

54:25.216 --> 54:27.417
Well, we have a difference
of opinion over theory.

54:27.418 --> 54:30.120
But your theory turns
me into a man from Mars.

54:30.121 --> 54:32.588
My theory doesn't do that to you.

54:32.589 --> 54:34.924
Are you suggesting I did something wrong

54:34.925 --> 54:37.226
in sending you into therapy so young?

54:37.227 --> 54:38.762
I didn't know you were
gonna stay there forever.

54:38.763 --> 54:40.463
I didn't think that I'd
had done anything wrong

54:40.464 --> 54:42.431
until you sent me there.

54:42.432 --> 54:46.269
Ben... you mean more to me
than anyone in the whole world.

54:46.270 --> 54:49.772
- You always have. Ben, you gotta say it.
- Say what?

54:49.773 --> 54:52.741
I'm the same as you. Just say it. Say it!

55:00.083 --> 55:03.618
No.

55:03.619 --> 55:06.755
You're not.

55:06.756 --> 55:08.857
I'm not gonna say it.

55:10.860 --> 55:13.896
Every time I lose this
fight, it hurts more.

55:13.897 --> 55:16.298
- I'm going home.
- Oh, come on, Lemon.

55:16.299 --> 55:17.932
I still love you.

55:17.933 --> 55:19.434
Sarah still loves you.

55:19.435 --> 55:21.603
- The cat still loves you.
- This is not a joke.

55:21.604 --> 55:25.840
You have my love, my legal
advice, my financial supervision.

55:25.841 --> 55:28.076
I can't give you the
courage to stand up to me

55:28.077 --> 55:30.912
and say you don't give a
flying fuck about what I think.

55:30.913 --> 55:32.681
Everybody's oppressed by somebody else

55:32.682 --> 55:35.382
in some form or another.

55:35.383 --> 55:38.586
Most of us learn to fight against
it despite people's opinions

55:38.587 --> 55:40.554
without the help of others.

55:40.555 --> 55:44.325
And stop trying to wring some kind
of admission of guilt out of me.

55:44.326 --> 55:47.028
Agreeing that you were born
just the same as I was born

55:47.029 --> 55:48.696
isn't gonna save your dying friends.

55:48.697 --> 55:52.333
<i>That is exactly what is going
to save my dying friends.</i>

55:52.334 --> 55:55.269
- You make it sound like I'm the enemy.
- I am beginning to think

55:55.270 --> 55:57.671
<i>that you and your straight
world are our enemy.</i>

55:57.672 --> 55:59.940
I am furious with you!

55:59.941 --> 56:02.509
And every goddamn doctor who made me feel

56:02.510 --> 56:04.278
it was sick to love a man.

56:04.279 --> 56:06.380
I am trying to understand

56:06.381 --> 56:09.750
<i>why nobody gives a shit that we're dying!</i>

56:11.518 --> 56:15.856
$5 million for a house? We can't
even get 27 cents from the city.

56:15.857 --> 56:20.393
<i>I know 43 guys who have died and
you say it's my cause not yours?</i>

56:20.394 --> 56:23.130
<i>You still think I'm sick!</i>

56:23.131 --> 56:27.300
I simply cannot allow it
for one single second longer.

56:27.301 --> 56:32.572
<i>I will not speak to you again
until you accept me as your equal!</i>

56:32.573 --> 56:34.374
Your healthy equal!

56:34.375 --> 56:36.476
Your brother!

56:39.513 --> 56:41.147
(Sighs)

56:43.984 --> 56:45.818
Yeah, be careful with that, boys.

56:45.819 --> 56:48.353
- That is a precious antique.
- Easy.

56:48.354 --> 56:50.355
I'm thinking we should put
that in the grand salon.

56:50.356 --> 56:52.191
Do we have a basement?
That's where it should go.

56:52.192 --> 56:54.827
Bella, I think it's time we moved
your filthy mouth above ground.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.928
I'll decorate tomorrow.

56:56.929 --> 56:58.697
Just shove it all in
there the best you can.

56:58.698 --> 57:00.399
Oh. (purrs)

57:00.400 --> 57:03.101
Okay, knock it off, both of you.

57:03.102 --> 57:05.170
(Lnocking at door) Excuse me.

57:05.171 --> 57:08.507
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

57:08.508 --> 57:10.742
My name is Estelle

57:10.743 --> 57:14.112
and my best friend Harvey died last night.

57:17.016 --> 57:20.718
We went everywhere together, you know?

57:20.719 --> 57:23.587
Like Broadway and the Rockettes

57:23.588 --> 57:25.123
and ice skating.

57:27.126 --> 57:30.127
He was a beautiful skater.

57:30.128 --> 57:31.962
I'm a klutz.

57:31.963 --> 57:35.633
But he didn't care.

57:35.634 --> 57:38.703
We had so much fun.

57:38.704 --> 57:41.372
Damn it, I wanna do something!

57:41.373 --> 57:42.973
Even though all my lesbian friends say,

57:42.974 --> 57:44.775
"What have you guys ever done for us?"

57:44.776 --> 57:49.446
But I don't care.

57:49.447 --> 57:51.581
This is for Harvey.

57:51.582 --> 57:55.585
Please... tell me you
can use me for something.

57:59.057 --> 58:01.058
- (Sobbing)
- Oh.

58:03.761 --> 58:07.063
I need a hotline director.
You think you can do that?

58:07.064 --> 58:09.733
- I don't know how.
- I don't either.

58:13.036 --> 58:15.238
Hey.

58:15.239 --> 58:17.440
Let me buy you a cup of coffee

58:17.441 --> 58:20.676

- Okay.

58:31.288 --> 58:34.357

- Yeah, this is good. Let's do it.

- Great! Fight, Bruce.

59:20.289 --> 59:22.470

I can't! So fuck you!

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.176
I'm not programmed for anything else.

01:05:06.246 --> 01:05:09.781
Ned, I have something to tell you.

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:12.250
- You're finally pregnant.
- (Chuckling)

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:17.989
I was married once.

01:05:21.727 --> 01:05:22.794
You never told me that.

01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:25.096
Yeah, I...

01:05:25.097 --> 01:05:26.898
she said I had been unfair to her,

01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:29.733
which I had been.

01:05:32.004 --> 01:05:34.972
- I have a son.
- You have a son.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:38.642
- She won't let me see him.
- You can't see your own son?

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:41.245
But didn't you fight?

01:05:41.246 --> 01:05:42.913
That means you're ashamed.

01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:45.182
So he will be, too.

01:05:45.183 --> 01:05:47.484
This is why I didn't tell
you. Who says I didn't fight?

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.386
<i>Ned?</i>

01:05:49.387 --> 01:05:52.356
What happens to people who can't
be as strong as you want them to be?

01:05:52.357 --> 01:05:54.692
Weakness scares the shit out of me!

01:05:54.693 --> 01:05:57.861
My father was weak, and
I'm afraid I'll be like him.

01:05:57.862 --> 01:06:00.831
His life didn't stand for
anything and then it was over.

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:02.866
So I fight, constantly.

01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:04.567
And if I can do it, I can't understand

01:06:04.568 --> 01:06:07.337
why everybody else can't do it, too, okay?

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.671
Wait, where are you going?

01:06:08.672 --> 01:06:10.807
Felix! Where you going?

01:06:10.808 --> 01:06:12.775
<i>(Door slams)</i>

01:06:14.278 --> 01:06:15.545
(Sighs

01:06:15.546 --> 01:06:18.013
Felix. I didn't mean
anything by that, Felix.

01:06:18.014 --> 01:06:20.650
I... I... I'm scared of... lots of things.

01:06:20.651 --> 01:06:24.420
Really. Heights. I never
told you I'm terrified of...

01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:26.622
what?

01:06:41.604 --> 01:06:44.539
It keeps getting bigger and bigger.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.808
It doesn't go away.

01:06:50.613 --> 01:06:52.481
(Thumps)

01:06:58.954 --> 01:07:00.955
Felix?

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:06.995
Who, may I ask, is Felix?

01:07:06.996 --> 01:07:10.631
I've never been so in love in my life.

01:07:10.632 --> 01:07:14.302
Never been in love in my life.

01:07:14.303 --> 01:07:17.939
Tell him to come to see me
first thing tomorrow 7:30.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.358
Ned, God damn it.

01:07:20.359 --> 01:07:22.504
What are we supposed to do?
Not be with anybody ever?

01:07:22.944 --> 01:07:26.013
It's not as easy as you might think.

01:07:26.014 --> 01:07:27.981
Oh, Em, I'm sorry.

01:07:27.982 --> 01:07:29.983
Don't be.

01:07:31.853 --> 01:07:33.654
How'd you get it?

01:07:33.655 --> 01:07:36.624
I was five years old.

01:07:36.625 --> 01:07:38.425
A woman from the Bahamas came to our town

01:07:38.426 --> 01:07:39.592
carrying the polio virus.

01:07:39.593 --> 01:07:43.030
She... stayed with friends.

01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:45.532
Their kid was in my kindergarten class.

01:07:45.533 --> 01:07:48.335
Four of us in that class got polio.

01:07:50.538 --> 01:07:53.440
I was all dressed up
in my Halloween costume

01:07:53.441 --> 01:07:55.274
to go
trick-or-treating

01:07:55.275 --> 01:07:58.144
and my mother felt my
forehead, put me to bed.

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:02.549
In the middle of the night,
I realized my whole body

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:05.284
except my arms and my hands were paralyzed.

01:08:05.285 --> 01:08:07.320
I was crying out for my mother.

01:08:07.321 --> 01:08:10.022
"I can't move, I can't move."

01:08:10.023 --> 01:08:13.725
They rushed me to the hospital,

01:08:13.726 --> 01:08:15.794
were told I'd be dead in 24 hours.

01:08:15.795 --> 01:08:17.430
I fought. I lived.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.765
Were you in an iron lung?

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:21.834
I was.

01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:24.569
Then I was in bed at home.

01:08:26.006 --> 01:08:29.073
I was connected to my
class with this little...

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:32.743
<i>- little loudspeaker.
- (Chair motor whirring)</i>

01:08:32.745 --> 01:08:36.381
<i>All the children were required to visit me.</i>

01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:40.819
We would say, "Hello,"

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:43.087
and then not know what to say next.

01:08:43.089 --> 01:08:45.223
They were all terrified of me.

01:08:45.224 --> 01:08:46.624
<i>Still are.</i>

01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:48.859
<i>I scare the shit out of people.</i>

01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:51.863
<i>The "holy terror" in a wheelchair.</i>

01:08:53.332 --> 01:08:54.599
I'm scaring people, too.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.402
Learn how to use it.

01:08:57.403 --> 01:09:00.337
Don't need everybody's love and approval.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.475
Ned, your organization is... worthless.

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:06.810
I can't get anyone important on the board.

01:09:06.812 --> 01:09:09.345
I've seen over 300
patients. Me. One doctor.

01:09:09.346 --> 01:09:12.049
All these guys who made
millions off of us...

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:15.720
fashion, rock, movies,
real estate, forget it.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.322
And any time Bruce doesn't agree with me,

01:09:18.323 --> 01:09:20.590
- he puts it to a board vote.
- And you lose.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.959
I can't pass along sex recommendations

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.029
or any information that isn't 100% certain.

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:28.131
Nothing is 100% certain in science.

01:09:28.133 --> 01:09:29.599
It wouldn't matter what you say anyway.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.435
Don't yell at me for what I'm not doing.

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:33.537
- What the fuck is your side doing?
- I don't know!

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:35.238
Where's your A.M.A.?

01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:39.943
Does being Jewish always make you hungry?

01:09:39.944 --> 01:09:42.278
I don't know. I'm not Jewish.

01:09:43.548 --> 01:09:45.881
I'm German.

01:09:45.883 --> 01:09:49.452
- Everybody thinks you're Jewish.
- I know.

01:09:49.453 --> 01:09:51.754
In medicine it helps.

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:57.993
You stayed in bed the
whole way through school?

01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.563
By college I had my first braces

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:03.699
and I could walk... a little.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.101
I don't walk so good anymore.

01:10:05.102 --> 01:10:07.302
Probably because I'm too busy to practice.

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:09.805
You must practice.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.441
Right now. I mean it.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.610
Right now. C'mon.

Hello. Are you related to the

Ned Weeks.

Bruce Niles. I'm the president.

01:13:51.954 --> 01:13:53.822
The mayor wants you to
know how much he cares

01:13:53.823 --> 01:13:56.625
and how impressed he is with
how you've been shouldering

01:13:56.626 --> 01:13:58.660
your own responsibilities.

Responsibilities? Everything we're doing

01:14:02.165 --> 01:14:04.266
is the stuff you guys should
be doing and we need help.

01:14:04.267 --> 01:14:05.867
Uh, what Mr. Weeks is trying to say, sir,

01:14:05.868 --> 01:14:07.568
is that... we're swamped.

01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:11.506
We're fielding over 500 calls
a day on our emergency hotline.

01:14:11.507 --> 01:14:13.708
And we're providing
information that, quite frankly,

01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:15.843
<i>the city should be providing, and isn't.</i>

01:14:15.844 --> 01:14:17.978
Sir, we need office space.
We have one small room.

01:14:17.979 --> 01:14:20.548
We have over 100 people calling
or walking in and out every day,

01:14:20.549 --> 01:14:22.717
and plus it's real hard when
people don't want to rent to us

01:14:22.718 --> 01:14:24.686
because we're...
- Whoa. That's illegal discrimination.

01:14:24.687 --> 01:14:26.187
Yeah, we know that to be true, sir.

01:14:26.188 --> 01:14:28.889
Mr. Keebler, it is not illegal to
discriminate against homosexuals.

01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:31.325
We've been waiting for 14
months to see the mayor.

01:14:31.326 --> 01:14:33.493
It's taken us a year to
get this meeting with you.

01:14:33.494 --> 01:14:34.600
You're an hour and a half late.

01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:36.955
Have you told the mayor
there's an epidemic going on?

01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:38.199
- Uh, says who?
- The government.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.967
<i>Which government? What? Our government?</i>

01:14:39.968 --> 01:14:42.303
An epidemic?
- The Centers for Disease Control declared it...

01:14:42.304 --> 01:14:44.338
<i>- 17 months ago.
- You can't not know this!</i>

01:14:44.339 --> 01:14:46.307
Could you please reduce
your level of hysteria?

01:14:46.308 --> 01:14:47.774
Certainly.

01:14:48.843 --> 01:14:52.145
New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles,

01:14:52.146 --> 01:14:56.082
Chicago, Boston, Denver. Every
single major American city

01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:57.617
is now showing cases.

01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:00.420
At least 25 foreign
countries. But New York City,

01:15:00.421 --> 01:15:02.922
our home, the city that
you have pledged to protect

01:15:02.923 --> 01:15:04.423
has more than half of everything.

01:15:04.424 --> 01:15:06.226
Half the cases, half the dead.

01:15:06.227 --> 01:15:08.995
I know 57 of the dead ones.
I don't wanna know any more.

01:15:08.996 --> 01:15:10.964
Now, when do we get to see the mayor?

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:13.066
14 months is a long
time to be out to lunch.

01:15:13.067 --> 01:15:16.202
<i>- You wait a minute.
- No, you wait a minute. We can't.</i>

01:15:16.203 --> 01:15:18.104
Time is not on our side.

01:15:18.105 --> 01:15:20.205
Now, if you won't take word to
the mayor, what are we gonna do?

01:15:20.206 --> 01:15:22.775
Hire a hunky hustler and
send him up to Gracie Mansion

01:15:22.776 --> 01:15:24.643
with a plea tattooed to his cock?

01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:28.313
- Mayor Koch is not gay!
- Tommy: Oh, come on, "Blanche."

01:15:29.783 --> 01:15:31.484
(Chuckles)

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:33.118
Listen.

01:15:33.119 --> 01:15:35.921
Don't you think I want to help you?

01:15:35.922 --> 01:15:38.490
I have a friend who is dying of this shit,

01:15:38.491 --> 01:15:40.926
right now in the V.A. hospital.

01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:44.763
But it's very tricky. You can
see that. It is very tricky.

01:15:44.764 --> 01:15:47.132
Tricky, shit! There are a
million gay people in New York.

01:15:47.133 --> 01:15:48.934
A million and one counting you!

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.503
You know what? A fire goes
out in a school furnace

01:15:51.504 --> 01:15:55.740
on the West Side. I get
3,000 calls in one day.

01:15:55.741 --> 01:15:57.609
You know what I mean?

01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:00.912
If so many of you are so upset, why
do I only hear from this loudmouth?

01:16:00.913 --> 01:16:04.482
- That's a very good question.
- Okay, so there are half a million

01:16:04.483 --> 01:16:08.319
gay men in our area. 315
cases doesn't seem too high,

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.721
<i>considering how many of
us... of you there are.</i>

01:16:10.722 --> 01:16:13.090
- This is bullshit!
- Ned, please.

01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:14.992
Look, I understand this is tricky, sir.

01:16:14.993 --> 01:16:17.461
- But we need your help...
- I think, that is, that the mayor thinks

01:16:17.462 --> 01:16:19.163
you guys are overreacting.

01:16:19.164 --> 01:16:23.734
You tell that cocksucker he is a
selfish, heartless son of a bitch!

01:16:30.374 --> 01:16:32.342
You are Michael R. Marcus. You hold

01:16:32.343 --> 01:16:34.678
an unsecure job with the
city's Department of Health.

01:16:34.679 --> 01:16:37.013
I'd watch out for your
friends if I were you.

01:16:41.553 --> 01:16:43.753
(Slaps)

01:16:49.093 --> 01:16:50.393
I don't believe that just happened.

01:16:50.394 --> 01:16:53.029
Mickey, I am going on
"The Today Show" tomorrow

01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:54.597
and I am telling them

01:16:54.598 --> 01:16:57.300
that the mayor just threatened
your job to shut us up.

01:16:57.301 --> 01:16:59.435
"The Today Show"? You're gonna what?

01:16:59.436 --> 01:17:02.472
They are treating us like
shit and we're allowing them.

01:17:02.473 --> 01:17:05.975
No, politicians, the only thing
they really respond to is pressure.

01:17:05.976 --> 01:17:08.978
You heard him with his
"3,000 West Side calls."

01:17:08.979 --> 01:17:10.646
<i>We're not yelling loud enough!</i>

01:17:10.647 --> 01:17:13.182

01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:20.422

<i>- This is Tommy.

<i>- Hey.
- Nick died.</i>

01:17:44.514 --> 01:17:46.781
Shit.

01:17:46.782 --> 01:17:48.782
God damn.

01:17:48.783 --> 01:17:52.586
<i>I'll call later when I know
more about the memorial.</i>

01:18:00.029 --> 01:18:02.030
<i>Tommy: I have this tradition.</i>

01:18:03.732 --> 01:18:06.133
<i>It's something I do now when a friend dies.</i>

01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:12.372
<i>I save his Rolodex card.</i>

01:18:12.373 --> 01:18:14.074
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

01:18:14.075 --> 01:18:16.176
<i>Throw it away in the trash can?</i>

01:18:16.177 --> 01:18:18.012
<i>(Scoffs) I won't do that.</i>

01:18:18.013 --> 01:18:19.880
<i>No, I won't.</i>

01:18:19.881 --> 01:18:21.915
<i>That's too final.</i>

01:18:25.286 --> 01:18:28.721
Last year I had five cards.

01:18:28.722 --> 01:18:31.624
Now I have 50.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.361
A collection of cardboard tombstones,

01:18:34.362 --> 01:18:36.796
<i>bound together with a rubber band.</i>

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:40.900
<i>I hate these fuckin' funerals.</i>

01:18:40.901 --> 01:18:43.002
<i>I really do.</i>

01:18:44.204 --> 01:18:45.872
And you know what else I hate?

01:18:45.873 --> 01:18:47.974
I hate the memorials.

01:18:47.975 --> 01:18:50.342
That's our social life now.

01:18:50.343 --> 01:18:52.645
Going to these things.

01:18:58.518 --> 01:19:01.653
Nick was a choreographer.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:04.723
I don't know if any of you knew that.

01:19:04.724 --> 01:19:08.026
<i>He was just starting out. He
didn't tell a lot of people.</i>

01:19:08.027 --> 01:19:11.096
<i>- (Sobbing)
- He was waiting to invite you to his</i>

01:19:11.097 --> 01:19:13.431
big debut at Carnegie Hall or some shit

01:19:13.432 --> 01:19:15.934
so we could all be proud of him.

01:19:18.972 --> 01:19:22.307
But he was so good.

01:19:22.308 --> 01:19:24.743
He had such promise.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.582
We're losing an entire generation.

01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:34.619
Young men at the beginning.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.054
Just gone.

01:19:37.055 --> 01:19:40.891
Choreographers, playwrights,

01:19:40.892 --> 01:19:43.561
dancers, actors.

01:19:45.296 --> 01:19:48.332
All those plays that won't get written now.

01:19:50.969 --> 01:19:54.739
All those dances never to be danced.

01:19:59.077 --> 01:20:02.646
In closing, I'm just gonna say I'm mad.

01:20:02.647 --> 01:20:04.814
I'm fuckin' mad.

01:20:06.184 --> 01:20:09.386
I keep screaming inside,
"Why are they letting us die?"

01:20:10.421 --> 01:20:13.056
"Why is no one helping us?"

01:20:16.927 --> 01:20:19.462
And here's the truth.

01:20:19.463 --> 01:20:21.631
Here's the answer.

01:20:24.635 --> 01:20:26.836
They just don't like us.

Good. That's the right attitude.

I don't know.

I was in Rio. Gregory...

01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:35.960
and I were in Rio.

01:26:35.961 --> 01:26:37.996
I get a call from Hiram's office

01:26:37.997 --> 01:26:41.198
saying I should be in his office
right away first thing this morning.

01:26:41.199 --> 01:26:44.168
From Rio? What kind of meeting?

01:26:44.169 --> 01:26:48.172
I get to City Hall, Hiram
keeps me waiting forever.

01:26:48.173 --> 01:26:51.075
And finally the commissioner
comes out and he says

01:26:51.076 --> 01:26:55.446
that Hiram doesn't want to see me anymore.

01:26:55.447 --> 01:27:01.252
I wanted to scream, "I haven't
slept in two days, you dumb fuck."

01:27:01.253 --> 01:27:04.221
But I didn't. Instead I said,

01:27:04.222 --> 01:27:06.257
"Please, sir, then...

01:27:06.258 --> 01:27:10.326
why did he make me come
all the way back from Rio?"

01:27:10.327 --> 01:27:13.997
And he says, "Oh, I'm afraid he
didn't take me into his confidence."

01:27:13.998 --> 01:27:16.099
And he walks off.

01:27:17.936 --> 01:27:21.538
Ned's article attacking
Hiram just came out.

01:27:21.539 --> 01:27:25.175
I'm not going to lose my job
because Ned doesn't like himself.

01:27:25.176 --> 01:27:27.944
What's that, Mick?

01:27:27.945 --> 01:27:30.947
You keep trying to get us to say
things that we don't wanna say

01:27:30.948 --> 01:27:32.549
and I don't think we can afford

01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:34.951
to make so many enemies
before we have enough friends.

01:27:34.952 --> 01:27:37.753
Terry Spaulding is
calling all of his friends

01:27:37.754 --> 01:27:40.323
from under his oxygen tank to say goodbye.

01:27:40.324 --> 01:27:42.658
<i>Tibby Maurer took an overdose.</i>

01:27:42.659 --> 01:27:45.728
<i>Hal Schechter has got stumps for feet.</i>

01:27:45.729 --> 01:27:50.633
- Frannie Santuzza's lost his mind!
- Will you stop it? Just stop!

01:27:50.634 --> 01:27:53.803
- Tommy: Mickey, you all right?
- I don't think so.

01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:57.673
Why can't they find the virus?

01:27:57.674 --> 01:27:59.541
Baby, it takes time.

01:27:59.542 --> 01:28:02.844
I work all day for the
city writing stuff on...

01:28:02.845 --> 01:28:04.679
breast-feeding versus formula

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.515
and how to stay calm when you have herpes.

01:28:06.516 --> 01:28:09.651
And at night I work on our newsletter
and our health column for the "Native."

01:28:09.652 --> 01:28:13.054
I just... I can't take it anymore.

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:16.925
I have written about every single theory.

01:28:16.926 --> 01:28:18.927
Repeated infection by a virus.

01:28:18.928 --> 01:28:20.695
New appearance by a dormant virus.

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:25.233
Single virus, new virus, old
virus, multi-virus, partial virus,

01:28:25.234 --> 01:28:27.736
<i>- latent virus, mutant virus...
- Tommy: Take it easy, honey.</i>

01:28:27.737 --> 01:28:30.404
No, we mustn't forget
about fucking and sucking

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:31.973
and kissing and blood and voodoo

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:33.741
and drugs and poppers and needles

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:36.010
and Africa, Haiti, Cuba, blacks,

01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:40.881
amoebas, pigs, fucking Uranus!

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:47.421
- What if it isn't any of them?
- I don't know.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:50.524
The great plague of London was
caused by drinking water from a pump

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:53.293
that just nobody... nobody noticed it.

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:58.431
Maybe it's predisposition
or the theory of the herd...

01:28:58.432 --> 01:29:02.903
only so many of us are going to
get it, then the pool's used up.

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:05.338
What if it's monogamy? Bruce, you and I

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.674
<i>could actually be worse off</i>

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:10.310
because of constant bombardment
from a single source...

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:12.212
our lovers.

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.813
So maybe the guys who go to the baths,

01:29:13.814 --> 01:29:15.515
maybe they've built up the best immunity.

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:18.918
I don't know what to tell anybody
anymore and everybody asks me.

01:29:18.919 --> 01:29:20.487
Who's right? I don't know.

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:22.421
Who's wrong? I feel...

01:29:22.422 --> 01:29:25.124
I feel so fucking inadequate.

01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:28.260
How can we tell people, "Stop"?

01:29:28.261 --> 01:29:32.131
(Stammers) It's just... I
don't... it might be caused by...

01:29:32.132 --> 01:29:33.700
I don't know. I don't know.

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:36.535
That's exactly how I feel.

01:29:36.536 --> 01:29:38.870
And maybe he's right.

01:29:38.871 --> 01:29:40.472
And that scares me.

01:29:40.473 --> 01:29:42.841
Neddy, you scare me.

01:29:42.842 --> 01:29:45.244
You really think the president...

01:29:45.245 --> 01:29:48.180
that he wants this to happen?
You really think the CIA

01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:50.115
has unleashed germ warfare

01:29:50.116 --> 01:29:53.118
to kill off all the queers
that Jerry Falwell doesn't want?

01:29:53.119 --> 01:29:56.487
- Mick. Try to hold on.
- To what?

01:29:56.488 --> 01:29:58.389
I used to love my country.

01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:00.391
The "Native" received an
anonymous letter describing

01:30:00.392 --> 01:30:03.795
top-secret Defense Department
experiments at Fort Detrick, Maryland...

01:30:03.796 --> 01:30:07.498
that have produced a virus that
can destroy the immune system.

01:30:07.499 --> 01:30:09.634
<i>Its codename was "Firm Hand."</i>

01:30:09.635 --> 01:30:12.637
They started testing it
in 1978 on a group of gays.

01:30:12.638 --> 01:30:13.971
I never used to believe shit like that...

01:30:13.972 --> 01:30:15.940
they're gonna persecute us!

01:30:15.941 --> 01:30:17.775
They're gonna cancel our health insurance,

01:30:17.776 --> 01:30:19.477
they're gonna put us into camps,
they're gonna quarantine us.

01:30:19.478 --> 01:30:21.346
<i>And you think that I'm killing people?</i>

01:30:21.347 --> 01:30:24.982
- That is not what I said.
- It is, you know you said it.

01:30:26.719 --> 01:30:28.753
I've spent 15 years of my life

01:30:28.754 --> 01:30:30.554
fighting for our right to be free

01:30:30.555 --> 01:30:32.522
and to make love wherever, whenever.

01:30:32.523 --> 01:30:34.058
And you're telling me all those years

01:30:34.059 --> 01:30:37.061
<i>of what being gay stood for is wrong!</i>

01:30:37.062 --> 01:30:40.765
And that I'm a murderer.

01:30:40.766 --> 01:30:45.101
We have been so oppressed.
Don't you remember?

01:30:45.102 --> 01:30:49.239
<i>Can't you see how important
it is for us to love openly,</i>

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:52.342
without hiding, without guilt?

01:30:52.343 --> 01:30:54.711
(Sobbing) Why can't you see that?

01:30:59.450 --> 01:31:01.648
I went to the top of the
Empire State Building.

01:31:01.649 --> 01:31:03.031
Okay, I'm taking you home.

01:31:03.032 --> 01:31:04.754
You can jump off from
there when nobody's looking.

01:31:04.755 --> 01:31:07.056
<i>Tommy: All right, Mickey,
let's go home. Right now.</i>

01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:15.364
Ned, I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

01:31:17.101 --> 01:31:19.868
All my life I've been hated for being gay,

01:31:19.869 --> 01:31:21.637
for being short...

01:31:21.638 --> 01:31:23.306
Jewish.

01:31:23.307 --> 01:31:24.873
So go ahead, you tell everybody.

01:31:24.874 --> 01:31:27.042
Tell everybody that we
were wrong and I'm sorry.

01:31:27.043 --> 01:31:29.578
Someday, somebody's gonna come along

01:31:29.579 --> 01:31:31.380
and they're gonna stick the knife in you

01:31:31.381 --> 01:31:34.616
and tell you everything you
fought for your whole life is shit!

01:31:34.617 --> 01:31:35.784
Mickey!

01:31:35.785 --> 01:31:38.520
Mickey! Get up!

01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:40.189
- Get up. Come here.
- It's okay.

01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:42.357
Come on.

01:31:42.358 --> 01:31:45.493
I'm gonna take you home now, okay?

01:31:45.494 --> 01:31:49.564
I don't wanna go home.
Take me to St. Vincent's.

01:31:49.565 --> 01:31:52.834
Okay. That's fine. Come. Let's go.

01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:57.839
Look, we're all real tired, you hear me?

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.477
We got ourselves here a
lot of bereavement overload.

01:32:08.884 --> 01:32:11.785
We're the fighters. Aren't we?

01:32:11.786 --> 01:32:14.421
We're the fi...
- You bet, sweetness.

01:32:14.422 --> 01:32:17.225
And you're a hero.?

01:32:17.226 --> 01:32:21.162
You're a hero whether you know that or not.

01:32:21.163 --> 01:32:23.164
You're our first hero.

01:32:23.165 --> 01:32:25.265
Let's go.

01:32:30.705 --> 01:32:32.406
<i>(Door closes)</i>

01:32:34.542 --> 01:32:36.543
You wanna be president?

01:32:36.544 --> 01:32:38.912
I just want Felix to live.

01:32:41.015 --> 01:32:43.683
<i>(Telephone ringing)</i>

01:32:49.823 --> 01:32:53.293
Gay Men's Health Crisis.

01:32:53.294 --> 01:32:56.296
Hiram, old buddy. How's it hanging?

01:33:04.605 --> 01:33:06.005
Mm.

01:33:10.577 --> 01:33:13.145
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:33:13.146 --> 01:33:15.114
The mayor's found a secret little fund

01:33:15.115 --> 01:33:17.482
for giving away money secretly.

01:33:17.483 --> 01:33:19.885
We are not allowed to tell
anyone where we got it,

01:33:19.886 --> 01:33:22.988
and if we do, we'll never get any more.

01:33:22.989 --> 01:33:25.690
- How much?
- $9,000.

01:33:27.493 --> 01:33:28.827
Ned.

01:33:32.097 --> 01:33:34.165
Albert's dead.

01:33:37.069 --> 01:33:40.071
His mother wanted to see him
in Phoenix before he died.

01:33:41.474 --> 01:33:44.743
And this was the last
week, when it was obvious.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:49.180
So I got permission from Emma
and took him to the airport.

01:33:57.889 --> 01:33:59.790
<i>Bruce: And when we got to the airport,</i>

01:33:59.791 --> 01:34:02.927
<i>the pilot refused to fly the plane.</i>

01:34:02.928 --> 01:34:05.629
<i>So I refused to get off of it.</i>

01:34:07.098 --> 01:34:10.900
<i>You would have been very proud of me, Ned.</i>

01:34:10.901 --> 01:34:13.203
<i>So finally we get another pilot</i>

01:34:15.506 --> 01:34:18.508
<i>and when we take off,</i>

01:34:18.509 --> 01:34:21.845
<i>Albert just loses his mind.</i>

01:34:21.846 --> 01:34:23.212
I don't wanna be in this thing.

01:34:23.213 --> 01:34:25.582
It's okay.
- I don't wanna be in this...

01:34:25.583 --> 01:34:28.485
- I'm just gonna go.
- No, Albert.

01:34:28.486 --> 01:34:30.353
<i>I don't wanna...</i>

01:34:30.354 --> 01:34:32.088
<i>- Bruce: Albert.
- Man: Tell him to sit down.</i>

01:34:32.089 --> 01:34:33.857
(passengers murmuring)

01:34:33.858 --> 01:34:37.794
- Bruce: I'm sorry.
- Sir, sir, you have to keep seated.

01:34:37.795 --> 01:34:41.230
<i>Man: Sit down up there.
- Sir, have a seat. You have to...</i>

01:34:41.231 --> 01:34:43.532
(Screaming) No!

01:34:43.533 --> 01:34:44.700
- Sir...
- Stop!

01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:46.402
<i>- (Grunting)
- Attendant: Sir!</i>

01:34:46.403 --> 01:34:49.905
We gotta sit down, okay?

01:34:49.906 --> 01:34:53.376
<i>Bruce: He doesn't recognize me.</i>

01:34:53.377 --> 01:34:54.877
It's me. It's me.

01:34:54.878 --> 01:34:56.979
<i>Bruce: Doesn't know where we're going.</i>

01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:59.147
<i>- We're almost home.
- That we're going to see his mother</i>

01:34:59.148 --> 01:35:03.118
<i>in Phoenix... nothing.</i>

01:35:03.119 --> 01:35:05.988
<i>- He just becomes...
- (Retching)</i>

01:35:05.989 --> 01:35:09.157
Oh, shit. Can I get a
goddamn towel, please?

01:35:09.158 --> 01:35:13.361
<i>Bruce: When we land in Phoenix
and when we get to the hospital</i>

01:35:13.362 --> 01:35:16.631
<i>where his mother had fixed
up the room real nice...</i>

01:35:20.469 --> 01:35:22.603
<i>Albert is dead.</i>

01:35:27.143 --> 01:35:29.911
<i>The hospital doctors refused to examine him</i>

01:35:29.912 --> 01:35:32.513
<i>and give him a cause of death
on his death certificate.</i>

01:35:32.514 --> 01:35:36.216
<i>Without the death certificate,
the undertakers will not take him.</i>

01:35:36.217 --> 01:35:39.954
<i>- And neither would the police.
- - Come on, man. Pull it down.</i>

01:35:39.955 --> 01:35:43.824
<i>Finally some orderly comes
in and stuffs my Albert</i>

01:35:43.825 --> 01:35:46.293
in an oversized Glad garbage bag

01:35:46.294 --> 01:35:49.496
and puts him in the alley
with the rest of the garbage.

01:35:50.898 --> 01:35:54.034
I did you a favor, man. I got him out.

01:35:54.035 --> 01:35:56.303
I want 50 bucks.

01:36:00.408 --> 01:36:03.076
(Whining)

01:36:05.412 --> 01:36:07.413
(mother wailing)

01:36:10.084 --> 01:36:12.251
(Screaming)

01:36:16.323 --> 01:36:18.324
(Sobbing)

01:36:19.393 --> 01:36:22.661
- Is that all of him?
- Yep.

01:36:22.662 --> 01:36:25.831
You want him? $3,000.

01:36:33.373 --> 01:36:37.175
He's gone. He's gone.

01:36:37.176 --> 01:36:40.779
Gone.

01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:44.049
(Gasping) Oh, God.

01:36:46.953 --> 01:36:49.121
<i>Ned: "I am telling you
they are murdering us</i>

01:36:52.258 --> 01:36:53.992
<i>"We're gonna die very soon,</i>

<i>(Distant siren wailing)</i>

Emma's in there waiting.

01:37:28.326 --> 01:37:31.295
Come on, two bites. Come on, now.

01:37:31.296 --> 01:37:35.032
- No.
- Don't make me break out the yogurt.

01:37:39.171 --> 01:37:42.706
- One more.
- Have you talked to your brother yet?

01:37:50.148 --> 01:37:53.850
I remember that about you.

01:37:53.851 --> 01:37:57.154
You don't talk to the people
you love most in the world.

01:38:03.894 --> 01:38:06.462
You want me to get better
and I'm not getting better

01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:09.065
and I feel so fucking guilty.

01:38:21.444 --> 01:38:24.613
You have a lunch meeting
with Bill Blass on Friday.

01:38:24.614 --> 01:38:27.950
- Fancy.
- Mm...

01:38:27.951 --> 01:38:30.219
I'm call with my regrets.

01:38:32.788 --> 01:38:34.250
What are you doing?

01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:36.274
Making a date with you two months from now.

01:38:36.859 --> 01:38:39.361
I've been invited to
speak at Yale's Gay Week.

01:38:39.362 --> 01:38:42.997
And we're going. Remember how I told
you they have those dances there now?

01:38:42.998 --> 01:38:45.467
You're my date.

01:38:57.213 --> 01:38:59.214
(Sobbing)

01:39:14.796 --> 01:39:17.365
I want you to live so much.

01:39:17.366 --> 01:39:19.933
I'm not supposed to say that.

01:39:22.737 --> 01:39:25.472
(Sighs)

01:39:25.473 --> 01:39:28.575
Oh, please, God. Give us one more year.

01:39:32.247 --> 01:39:34.948
I promise I'll eat my spinach.

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:02.008
<i>Emma: I am taking care</i>

01:40:02.009 --> 01:40:03.976
of more victims of this disease

01:40:03.977 --> 01:40:05.611
<i>than anyone in the world.</i>

01:40:05.612 --> 01:40:07.780
<i>We have more frozen blood samples,</i>

01:40:07.781 --> 01:40:09.915
<i>more data of every kind,</i>

01:40:09.916 --> 01:40:12.551
<i>and much more experience.</i>

01:40:15.121 --> 01:40:18.624
Dr. Brookner, the
government's position is this.

01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:22.461
There are $5 million in the
pipeline for which we have received

01:40:22.462 --> 01:40:25.096
over $55 million worth of requests.

01:40:25.097 --> 01:40:28.867
5 million doesn't seem quite
right for some 2,000 cases.

01:40:28.868 --> 01:40:33.805
The government spent 3 million
investigating seven deaths from Tylenol.

01:40:33.806 --> 01:40:36.607
- We're entering the third year.
- We voted to reject

01:40:36.608 --> 01:40:39.077
your application for funding.

01:40:39.078 --> 01:40:41.546
Oh?

01:40:41.547 --> 01:40:43.013
I'd like to hear your reasons.

01:40:43.014 --> 01:40:45.249
The direction of the
research you're suggesting

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:48.118
is imprecise and unfocused.

01:40:48.119 --> 01:40:50.688
Oh, it is, is it?

01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:52.957
You don't know what's
going on any more than I do.

01:40:52.958 --> 01:40:56.461
<i>Could you tell me precisely
why you're blocking my efforts?</i>

01:40:56.462 --> 01:40:59.129
Dr. Brookner. There are
now other investigators.

01:40:59.130 --> 01:41:02.366
<i>This is no longer only your disease,
though you seem to think it is.</i>

01:41:02.367 --> 01:41:03.800
Oh, I do, do I?

01:41:03.801 --> 01:41:06.603
And you're here to take it
away from me, is that it?

01:41:06.604 --> 01:41:09.273
Well, I'll let you in on
a little secret, Doctor.

01:41:09.274 --> 01:41:11.041
You can have it. I didn't
want it in the first place.

01:41:11.042 --> 01:41:13.477
You think it's a privilege
to watch young men die?

01:41:13.478 --> 01:41:15.479
What am I arguing with you for?

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.748
You do not know enough
to study boiled water.

01:41:17.749 --> 01:41:20.016
How dare you come down here and judge me?!

01:41:20.017 --> 01:41:22.986
We only serve on this peer review
panel at the behest of Dr. Murray.

01:41:22.987 --> 01:41:26.923
Another idiot... and, by the
way, a closeted homosexual

01:41:26.924 --> 01:41:31.127
doing everything in his power
to sweep this under the rug.

01:41:31.128 --> 01:41:34.430
And I vowed I'd never say
anything like that in public.

01:41:34.431 --> 01:41:36.032
How does it always happen

01:41:36.033 --> 01:41:38.434
that all of the idiots
are always on your team?

01:41:38.435 --> 01:41:41.837
How can you refuse to fund my research

01:41:41.838 --> 01:41:45.041
or not invite me to participate in yours?

01:41:45.042 --> 01:41:47.377
Your National Institutes of Health

01:41:47.378 --> 01:41:50.546
received my first request
for money two years ago.

01:41:50.547 --> 01:41:54.082
It took you one year just to
print up application forms.

01:41:54.083 --> 01:41:56.886
It's taken you three years
from my first reported case

01:41:56.887 --> 01:42:00.790
just to show up here for a look,
and the paltry amount of money

01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:04.493
<i>you are forcing us to beg
for out of the $4 billion</i>

01:42:04.494 --> 01:42:07.095
you now receive each and every year

01:42:07.096 --> 01:42:10.865
to protect the health of American people

01:42:10.866 --> 01:42:13.768
<i>won't come to anyone
before only God knows when.</i>

01:42:13.769 --> 01:42:16.638
A promising virus has
been discovered in France.

01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:18.407
Why do you refuse to
cooperate with the French?

01:42:18.408 --> 01:42:22.109
<i>Why are we told not to
cooperate with the French?</i>

01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:24.446
Just so you can steal a Nobel Prize

01:42:24.447 --> 01:42:28.483
while something is being
passed around that causes death!

01:42:30.085 --> 01:42:32.487
Women have been discovered
to have it in Africa

01:42:32.488 --> 01:42:35.323
where it is clearly
transmitted heterosexually.

01:42:35.324 --> 01:42:37.158
It is only a question of time.

01:42:37.159 --> 01:42:39.660
<i>We could all be dead
before you do anything.</i>

01:42:39.661 --> 01:42:42.229
You want my data? You want my ideas?

01:42:42.230 --> 01:42:44.131
You want my patients? Take them!

01:42:44.132 --> 01:42:46.700
(Screams) Just do something with them!

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.674
You're fucking right! I am...

01:42:53.675 --> 01:42:57.711
imprecise and unfocused
and you are all idiots!

01:43:12.059 --> 01:43:14.095
Dick: Did you organize
that picketing of the mayor?

01:43:14.096 --> 01:43:15.040
Ned: Yes.

01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:17.263
- And the signs?
- Yes.

01:43:17.264 --> 01:43:19.799
And your next play is about a First Lady

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.502
- who gave the best blow jobs in Hollywood.
- Yes.

01:43:22.503 --> 01:43:25.738
- This place is perfect for our new office.
- Yes.

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:38.885
So tidy.

01:43:38.886 --> 01:43:41.787
Here.

01:43:41.788 --> 01:43:43.523
I got him.

01:43:43.524 --> 01:43:45.190
Come on. Let's get you back to bed.

01:43:45.191 --> 01:43:47.559
Okay.

01:43:48.895 --> 01:43:50.828
Here you go.

01:43:50.829 --> 01:43:53.931
Estelle made you some
stuffed cabbage for later.

01:43:56.502 --> 01:43:58.669
<i>Ned: There's this new drug in Paris.</i>

01:43:59.738 --> 01:44:02.306
Kessler's lover is flying out to get it.

01:44:04.276 --> 01:44:07.978
Here it is. HPA-23.

01:44:10.615 --> 01:44:12.616
Ned.

01:44:14.853 --> 01:44:17.555
- He looks awful
- You this is anything

01:44:17.556 --> 01:44:20.190
or is it just another shit
drug like all the rest?

01:44:24.662 --> 01:44:27.830
I think you need to prepare
yourself for letting go.

01:44:30.301 --> 01:44:33.903
You can't stop fighting
for the ones you love.

01:44:33.904 --> 01:44:37.207
Haven't you ever had to
fight for somebody you love?

01:44:46.416 --> 01:44:49.786
Tommy. You gotta start
putting yourself out there

01:44:49.787 --> 01:44:52.855
in a way that everyone
else could see what I see.

01:44:56.426 --> 01:44:59.861
What kind of a fucked-up
love scene is this?

01:44:59.862 --> 01:45:02.631
(Chuckles)

01:45:03.733 --> 01:45:05.734
<i>(Telephone ringing)</i>

01:45:10.574 --> 01:45:12.808
Yes?

01:45:12.809 --> 01:45:15.410
Yes, ma'am?

01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:17.412
4:30 tomorrow?

01:45:17.413 --> 01:45:19.615
Yes, ma'am.

01:45:20.817 --> 01:45:23.151
The fucking White House.

01:45:23.152 --> 01:45:26.321
Fuck the mayor. I've just been
invited to the White House.

01:45:26.322 --> 01:45:27.923
They're gonna do something!

01:45:33.162 --> 01:45:34.629
<i>Ned: Oh, just so I understand,</i>

01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:37.432
<i>what exactly does your title mean</i>

01:45:37.433 --> 01:45:39.834
in terms of our plague?

01:45:39.835 --> 01:45:43.037
We prefer not to use negative
terms. It only scares people.

01:45:43.038 --> 01:45:46.741
Well, there's 3,339 cases so far.

01:45:46.742 --> 01:45:49.543
<i>1,122 dead.</i>

01:45:49.544 --> 01:45:51.679
Sounds like a plague to me. I'm scared.

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.580
Aren't you?

01:45:53.581 --> 01:45:55.415
What does your title mean again?

01:45:55.416 --> 01:45:57.718
I come up with ideas for the president

01:45:57.719 --> 01:45:59.654
about what he ought to
be doing and not doing.

01:45:59.655 --> 01:46:01.321
Okay, good. Got it.

01:46:01.322 --> 01:46:04.124
So, the money's there, right?
It just hasn't been spent.

01:46:04.125 --> 01:46:07.227
So there's this new drug in France.

01:46:07.228 --> 01:46:08.862
Why doesn't the N.I.H. study it?

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:12.432
<i>I mean, what I want, what we
want, what we desperately need</i>

01:46:12.433 --> 01:46:14.768
is for somebody to help us
cut through all this red tape.

01:46:14.769 --> 01:46:17.103
I can asure you that not a week goes by

01:46:17.104 --> 01:46:20.073
that I don't bring new information
and reports to the president.

01:46:20.074 --> 01:46:21.607
The progress that's
been made on this disease

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:23.810
- is unprecedented.
- But it's contagious.

01:46:23.811 --> 01:46:25.645
Can't you see that because it's contagious,

01:46:25.646 --> 01:46:28.548
(Stammers) you... you have to work faster?

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.285
Do you really believe that anybody

01:46:32.286 --> 01:46:35.421
<i>in a serious public policy
position in their heart of hearts</i>

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:37.657
or even in their most closeted meetings

01:46:37.658 --> 01:46:39.458
says to each other, "Hey, guys,

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.494
let's not get too upset about this"?

01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:44.564
Yes, your boss hasn't said
the word "AIDS" out loud.

01:46:57.476 --> 01:47:00.612
Answer me this one question.

01:47:00.613 --> 01:47:02.715
This shit, can... can hookers get it?

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:05.084
Or, you know, someone
who had a one-night stand?

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.819
- Of course.
- You can't prove that.

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:09.020
I mean, from what I
understand, what I've read,

01:47:09.021 --> 01:47:11.055
female-to-male
transmissions through normal

01:47:11.056 --> 01:47:13.991
vaginal intercourse does not
seem to be very efficient.

01:47:15.561 --> 01:47:17.262
It's a virus, y it doesn't discriminate.

01:47:17.263 --> 01:47:18.963
Yes, but...

01:47:18.964 --> 01:47:21.700
it's very difficult. Isn't it?

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:25.436
It's almost impossible
for a straight, you know,

01:47:25.437 --> 01:47:28.239
regular heterosexual guy
to get it, am I right?

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:31.042
- I'm sorry?
- There's no documented cases, am I right?

01:47:31.043 --> 01:47:33.144
There's not a single documented case

01:47:33.145 --> 01:47:35.980
of a heterosexual man getting it?

01:47:35.981 --> 01:47:39.283
<i>Not from fucking or a blow job?</i>

01:47:39.284 --> 01:47:41.818
I don't have that information.

01:47:47.459 --> 01:47:49.860
Great, that's what I thought.

01:47:55.734 --> 01:47:57.468
Susan, call my meeting.

01:47:57.469 --> 01:48:00.804
I'll be about 15 minutes late. Thanks.

01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:08.178
- Thank you so much.
- Wait, please.

01:48:08.179 --> 01:48:10.847
<i>- Call me anytime.
- Sir. Wait.</i>

01:48:10.848 --> 01:48:12.448
<i>(Telephone ringing)</i>

01:48:17.554 --> 01:48:20.990
(yelling) 100 million predicted

01:48:20.991 --> 01:48:24.694
and nobody is paying any attention!

01:48:24.695 --> 01:48:27.997
Hi, I need security on the second floor.

01:48:45.548 --> 01:48:48.350
<i>(Door creaks)</i>

01:48:57.126 --> 01:48:58.760
Why you sitting on the floor?

01:48:58.761 --> 01:49:02.197
I fell down trying to
get from there to here.

01:49:07.436 --> 01:49:09.037
Oh, don't touch me! God.

01:49:09.038 --> 01:49:11.139
<i>(Sighs sharply)</i>

01:49:13.342 --> 01:49:15.443
I hate it when you look at me.

01:49:19.014 --> 01:49:22.216
You hungry? I'm hungry, how about you?

01:49:24.319 --> 01:49:27.355
I looked in all my datebooks.

01:49:27.356 --> 01:49:29.490
No one else I slept with is sick.

01:49:29.491 --> 01:49:31.592
Maybe you're the carrier.

01:49:37.565 --> 01:49:41.301
We don't have to do this to each other.

01:49:41.302 --> 01:49:44.071
You're gonna get better, Felix. You are.

01:49:47.508 --> 01:49:50.244
Emma says the N.I.H. is
finally starting research.

01:49:50.245 --> 01:49:51.979
- We have to hope.
- Oh, do we?

01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:55.314
- Yes, we do.
- Do we? And how am I supposed to do that?

01:49:55.315 --> 01:49:56.949
Huh?

01:50:01.321 --> 01:50:03.456
Stop eating that shit!

01:50:03.457 --> 01:50:06.426
- Give it to me.
- No!

01:50:07.895 --> 01:50:09.996
You know how important it
is to watch your nutrition.

01:50:09.997 --> 01:50:11.998
I have a life expectancy
of 10 more minutes.

01:50:11.999 --> 01:50:14.233
I'll eat what I wanna eat.

01:50:17.670 --> 01:50:19.238
(Groans)

01:50:21.341 --> 01:50:24.810
Ned.

01:50:24.811 --> 01:50:28.313
It's getting messier. Okay?

01:50:28.314 --> 01:50:31.149
I don't wanna make you see it.

01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:32.451
Nobody can make me do anything.

01:50:32.452 --> 01:50:34.119
You should know that better than anybody.

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.522
Now you gonna sit there on the
floor for the rest of your life?

01:50:36.523 --> 01:50:37.923
<i>- Do you hear me?
- Do you hear me?</i>

01:50:37.924 --> 01:50:39.558
<i>- No!
- No?</i>

01:50:39.559 --> 01:50:42.761
I've had over 40 treatments. No?

01:50:42.762 --> 01:50:47.632
I've had three... no, four
different kinds of chemo. No!

01:50:47.633 --> 01:50:49.200
<i>I've had three different experimentals.</i>

01:50:49.201 --> 01:50:51.836
Emma has spent more time
on me than anyone else.

01:50:51.837 --> 01:50:53.604
And it hasn't done a thing!

01:50:55.841 --> 01:50:57.608
You cannot force the
goddamn sun to come out!

01:50:57.609 --> 01:51:01.446
I am so sick of fighting

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:03.648
and everybody's stupidity

01:51:05.517 --> 01:51:07.284
You can't eat the food? Don't eat the food.

01:51:07.285 --> 01:51:10.120
I don't care. Take your
poison, I don't care.

01:51:10.121 --> 01:51:11.722
Fish is good for you.

01:51:11.723 --> 01:51:13.390
Don't want any of that, do we?

01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:15.660
<i>No green salad!</i>

01:51:15.661 --> 01:51:18.429
No broccoli! No vegetables!

01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:20.831
No bread with seven grain!

01:51:20.832 --> 01:51:23.000
Why would anyone ever want any milk?

01:51:23.001 --> 01:51:25.869
- You might get some calcium in your bones!

01:51:28.173 --> 01:51:29.974

01:51:45.089 --> 01:51:47.357
(Sobs)

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.969

Gay Men's Health Crisis.

01:52:39.441 --> 01:52:41.007
Thrush is a fungus, yes.

01:52:41.008 --> 01:52:42.501
Can you tell him that
we'll be picketing there

01:52:42.502 --> 01:52:44.045
and not afraid of arrest
or police brutality.

01:52:44.046 --> 01:52:45.212
<i>- Gay Men's Health Crisis.
- That's right.</i>

01:52:45.213 --> 01:52:47.582
The mayor has four more
hours before we carry out

01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:49.984
our threats of civil disobedience
if he doesn't meet with us.

01:52:49.985 --> 01:52:52.186
Tommy got the call yesterday, Ned.

01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:57.058
Why didn't you tell me?!

01:52:57.059 --> 01:52:58.792
You see, it works!

01:52:58.793 --> 01:53:02.430
<i>- When? When?
- Only two can go to the meeting, Ned.</i>

01:53:03.865 --> 01:53:05.732
- When?
- Tommy's executive director.

01:53:05.733 --> 01:53:08.902
I'm going.

01:53:08.903 --> 01:53:10.938
- I polled the fucking board, Ned.
- I wrote that letter

01:53:10.939 --> 01:53:12.973
to the mayor. That meeting is mine.

01:53:12.974 --> 01:53:15.842
I am going to go and
represent this organization

01:53:15.843 --> 01:53:18.511
that I have spent every
minute of my life fighting for

01:53:18.512 --> 01:53:20.480
<i>and that was started in my living room</i>

01:53:20.481 --> 01:53:22.348
or I quit.

01:53:28.389 --> 01:53:30.290
You'd let me quit?

01:53:39.567 --> 01:53:41.367
The board asked me to
read this out loud to you.

01:53:41.368 --> 01:53:43.869
- Read what?
- A letter.

01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:45.972
Ahem.

01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:52.611
Go on, read it.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.116
"We are circulating this
letter widely among people

01:53:58.117 --> 01:54:01.586
of judgment and good sense.

01:54:01.587 --> 01:54:06.324
You are on a colossal
ego trip we must curtail.

01:54:06.325 --> 01:54:09.293
To manipulate fear as
you have done repeatedly

01:54:09.294 --> 01:54:13.131
is to us, sheer barbarism.

01:54:13.132 --> 01:54:15.799
<i>To exploit the deaths of
gay men as you have done</i>

01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:19.203
on television and in
publications all over America

01:54:19.204 --> 01:54:22.740
is to us, an act of vandalism.

01:54:23.775 --> 01:54:27.144
<i>And after years of liberation,</i>

01:54:27.145 --> 01:54:30.748
<i>you helped make sex dirty again for us...</i>

01:54:30.749 --> 01:54:34.317
terrible and forbidden.

01:54:34.318 --> 01:54:37.121
We are more angry at you

01:54:37.122 --> 01:54:40.290
than ever in our lives toward anyone.

01:54:40.291 --> 01:54:44.027
<i>We think you want to lead us all.</i>

01:54:44.028 --> 01:54:45.828
Well...

01:54:45.829 --> 01:54:49.299
we do not want you to lead us.

01:54:52.703 --> 01:54:57.206
In accordance with our bylaws
as drawn up by Weeks, Frankel,

01:54:57.207 --> 01:54:59.142
Levinstein,

01:54:59.143 --> 01:55:01.744
Mr. Ned Weeks is hereby removed

01:55:01.745 --> 01:55:05.548
<i>as a director of Gay Men's Health Crisis.</i>

01:55:05.549 --> 01:55:09.585
We beg that you leave us quietly

01:55:09.586 --> 01:55:13.722
and not destroy us and
what good work we manage

01:55:13.723 --> 01:55:16.358
despite your disapproval.

01:55:16.359 --> 01:55:19.027
Effective immediately."

01:55:34.543 --> 01:55:37.412
(Door bangs)

01:55:37.413 --> 01:55:39.681
<i>(Door closes)</i>

01:55:41.617 --> 01:55:43.118
<i>Tommy: Ned.</i>

01:55:43.119 --> 01:55:46.387
The executive director isn't
on the board, you know that.

01:55:46.388 --> 01:55:48.022
I don't have a vote.

01:55:48.023 --> 01:55:49.490
<i>(Stammers) What could...
what could I have done?</i>

01:55:49.491 --> 01:55:51.892
- You didn't support me.
- That's not true.

01:55:51.893 --> 01:55:53.328
You're all nothing but undertakers.

01:55:53.329 --> 01:55:55.062
This whole organization
is a funeral parlor.

01:55:55.063 --> 01:55:57.832
Ned...
- All you do is take care of the dying.

01:55:57.833 --> 01:56:00.101
Who's fighting so the
living can go on living?

01:56:00.102 --> 01:56:02.203
Who's fighting for my Felix?

01:56:02.204 --> 01:56:05.272
Tommy. We need you upstairs.

01:56:10.411 --> 01:56:13.214
I belong to a culture that
includes Marcel Proust,

01:56:13.215 --> 01:56:16.617
Walt Whitman, Tennessee
Williams, Alexander the Great,

01:56:16.618 --> 01:56:19.453
so many popes and cardinals
you wouldn't believe.

01:56:19.454 --> 01:56:22.522
Mr. Green Beret, did you know that
it was an openly gay Englishman

01:56:22.523 --> 01:56:25.158
who's responsible for winning World War II?

01:56:25.159 --> 01:56:28.762
His name's Alan Turing and he
cracked the Germans' Enigma code.

01:56:28.763 --> 01:56:30.664
After the war was over,
he committed suicide

01:56:30.665 --> 01:56:33.667
because he was so hounded for being gay.

01:56:33.668 --> 01:56:36.335
<i>Why didn't they teach
any of that in schools?</i>

01:56:36.336 --> 01:56:40.706
A gay man is responsible
for winning World War II!

01:56:42.009 --> 01:56:43.777
If they did, maybe he
wouldn't have killed himself

01:56:43.778 --> 01:56:47.046
and you wouldn't be so
terrified of who you are.

01:56:50.417 --> 01:56:53.452
That's how I want to be remembered.

01:56:53.453 --> 01:56:55.521
As one of the men who won the war.

01:56:59.459 --> 01:57:03.562
Bruce, I know that I am an asshole.

01:57:03.563 --> 01:57:07.132
But please don't shut me out.

01:57:43.635 --> 01:57:46.070
Go.

01:57:59.951 --> 01:58:02.185
Your brother and I are lovers.

01:58:03.888 --> 01:58:06.590
I'm dying and I need to make a will.

01:58:09.126 --> 01:58:11.194
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:58:24.641 --> 01:58:27.978
I want to leave everything to Ned.

01:58:30.647 --> 01:58:34.984
- How's my brother?
- Well, he blames himself for everything

01:58:34.985 --> 01:58:39.989
from my dying to the
state of the entire world.

01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:43.359
All that plus you two still not talking.

01:58:45.863 --> 01:58:48.364
You must be as stubborn as he is.

01:58:50.433 --> 01:58:52.134
I'll call him right away.

01:58:52.135 --> 01:58:55.304
Do. He's at home packing.

01:58:55.305 --> 01:58:58.874
We're going to Yale in a few days.

01:58:58.875 --> 01:59:01.977
For Gay Week. (Chuckles)

01:59:01.978 --> 01:59:03.812
He says he can't believe it.

01:59:05.981 --> 01:59:09.117
He tried to kill himself
there when he was a freshman.

01:59:13.923 --> 01:59:16.491
I haven't much...

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:20.862
except for a beautiful piece of land

01:59:20.863 --> 01:59:23.764
on the Cape in Wellfleet.

01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.668
Ned doesn't know about it.

01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:29.603
It was to have been a surprise

01:59:29.604 --> 01:59:31.940
for when we lived there together

01:59:31.941 --> 01:59:36.144
or riding away happily ever after.

01:59:36.145 --> 01:59:39.547
I also have an insurance policy,

01:59:39.548 --> 01:59:42.850
uh... with the "Times." I'm a reporter...

01:59:42.851 --> 01:59:44.585
for "The New York Times."

01:59:44.586 --> 01:59:48.456
It's meant to come to my next of kin.

01:59:48.457 --> 01:59:50.090
I'm afraid they might not give it to him.

01:59:50.091 --> 01:59:52.225
Well, if he's listed as
a beneficiary, they must.

01:59:52.226 --> 01:59:54.661
You're smarter than
that. Don't be so naive.

01:59:54.662 --> 01:59:58.398
I assure you, I will fight
to make sure that they do.

02:00:01.635 --> 02:00:05.005
I was hoping you'd say that.

02:00:05.006 --> 02:00:07.207
(Coughing)

02:00:12.279 --> 02:00:14.313
Felix...

02:00:16.116 --> 02:00:18.718

You are, honey.

02:01:19.778 --> 02:01:21.812
It should... it should be something

02:01:21.813 --> 02:01:27.217
Perry Ellis ran up for me personally.

02:01:34.092 --> 02:01:36.226
Ned?

02:01:40.731 --> 02:01:43.567
You find a way to fight again.
