WEBVTT

01:38.307 --> 01:39.308
Get you anything?

01:43.896 --> 01:44.897
Aloha.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.190
Mahalo.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.525
-Rabbi Sherman.
-Hello, boychick.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.777
-Or should I say the king of Ping-Pong?
-It's true.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.613
-Watch out. He has ninja moves.
-Thanks.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.325
Thea?
Either you're growing, or I'm shrinking.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.952
Hey, Nick and Toni's, right?

01:59.036 --> 02:01.455
-Wednesday night. I'm calling you!
-You got it.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.664
You're gonna love the corn.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.210
Round Swamp Farm's.
I shucked it myself. There he is!

02:08.502 --> 02:09.713
Everybody, duck!

02:10.297 --> 02:12.883
-Don't say it. Don't even think it.
-What?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.135
-I'm not playing golf with you again.
-Why not?

02:15.219 --> 02:17.638
"Why not?" That wasn't golf.
That was more like hockey.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.306
I was afraid for my life.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.100
Have you tried the hot tub yet?
You should try the hot tub.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.185
Even you can't miss that.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.020
I ought to…

02:26.230 --> 02:27.606
Benjamin, what's going on?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.691
You look so hot.
You look like you're gonna faint.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.276
Fresh air doesn't agree with me.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.654
Well, that's because your mother
raised you as veal.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.783
Come on. Let's go in here, all right?
There's air-conditioning.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.577
There are hundreds of movies,
all Academy Award winners.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.787
Mind the boccie balls.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.831
Lisa. Ike Herschkopf.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.916
-Hi.
-Thanks for coming.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.626
-You look gorgeous as always.
-Thank you.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.461
You don't mind if we get
a picture real quick?

02:49.545 --> 02:50.879
-Sure.
-Okay, so which button is--

02:50.963 --> 02:52.798
-It's on top.
-Do I have to wind it--

02:52.881 --> 02:54.132
No, no. It's ready.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.217
Okay.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.928
-Top.
-I pressed the wrong one.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.389
-Can I just go find my glasses?
-No. You know--

03:00.472 --> 03:02.724
It's okay. Hey, hey! Come. Come here.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.059
-Thank you.
-Okay.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.019
Come here. Can-- Take this picture of us.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.357
-Enjoying yourself? Great.
-I am. I am.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.775
Gorgeous. I love the house.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.901
Thank you.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.321
-Success.
-Great.

03:16.405 --> 03:19.700
Come, I wanna show you these cows.
I got 'em in a gallery in the city.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.326
-Okay.
-They're so fun.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.161
Collect some of these wet towels,
will you?

05:00.759 --> 05:02.010
Okay, stay in this room.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.097
Stop. And then-- Hey, where are you going?
Back in here.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.517
I'm gonna look for him-- There he--
Come on. Say hi to your uncle, Lizzie.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.061
Uh-oh. Phyllis, call the exterminator.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.731
We've got pesky little critters
running around in the building.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.317
I made an appointment with Dr. Herschkopf

05:17.401 --> 05:19.820
-for you for this afternoon.
-Oh, my gosh. They're all over me.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.405
What are they, exactly?

05:21.488 --> 05:26.034
Let's see. They have a lot of fur, and--
Look at these little sticky paws.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.870
-Did you hear me?
-I can't go.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.372
-Why can't you go?
-Look,

05:30.455 --> 05:32.833
-I don't want to talk to some stranger--
-He's not a stranger.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.835
Rabbi Goldberg recommended him.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.920
No, I know. I know. Hey!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.172
Don't tickle me.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.592
Okay, girls, girls. Knock it off.
Leave your Uncle Marty alone.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.137
Come on, let's take the picture
before you ruin your outfits.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.764
Girls! Come. Come, come, come.
Let's go. Come on.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.266
Put the phone down, please.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.475
Is that yours?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.728
No. All right, thank you.
You look adorable.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.397
Look at this. Here's the question.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.151
Do they make traps big enough
to capture all these pesky critters?

05:59.234 --> 06:02.070
I'm sure they do. We got some in the back.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.448
Yeah, we do. Bruce, go get the broom.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.908
Yeah, we gotta get the--

06:05.991 --> 06:08.577
-Oh, my God! My head!
-Go get the broom!

06:11.205 --> 06:12.206
So, will you go?

06:12.289 --> 06:16.376
I don't need to see Dr. Herschkopf, okay?
I'm totally fine.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.423
Uh-oh.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.384
Looks like we do have some vermin
in the building.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.761
Oh, shoot!

06:28.722 --> 06:30.516
-All right, you take the camera.
-Yeah.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.559
-I'll deal with her. Okay?
-Yeah, okay.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.062
Fine.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.023
Here we go.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.441
-Deborah!
-Where is he?

06:39.525 --> 06:40.943
Good to see you as well.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.279
-Did you pass on my messages to Marty?
-Yes. All eight of them.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.323
Are you sure? 'Cause he didn't call back.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.493
Maybe that's because you two broke up.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.454
No. You don't break up with someone
by fax, Phyllis.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.123
No, I agree, but there are worse ways.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.793
My husband ended our marriage
by fucking his secretary.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.336
So, I'd take a fax any day.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.089
Okay, I don't really care. I just-- Okay.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.261
I wanna see him.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.180
-He's not here.
-He can't keep hiding from me.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.390
I'm pretty sure he can.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.558
He owes me.

07:12.641 --> 07:16.687
Okay, let's cut this bullshit.
I can't. I can't with this today.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.189
He owes you nothing. It's over.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.401
There's something I need to talk
to him about.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.862
It's a private matter.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.697
Are you pregnant again?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.658
-How fucking dare you accuse me of that?
-Didn't you?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.368
-Fuck you, Phyllis.
-Listen to me.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.870
Marty is a nice guy.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.498
In fact, he's too nice. But I don't suffer
from that particular affliction

07:36.582 --> 07:38.542
and I will not let you exploit him.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.710
What are you? His guard dog?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.962
Worse. I'm his sister.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.131
A guard dog will just bite you,

07:44.214 --> 07:46.091
but a sister will rip out
your goddamn trachea

07:46.175 --> 07:47.718
and play it like a fucking flute.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.802
You get the difference?

07:48.886 --> 07:50.721
This is none of your goddamn business,
Phyllis!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.139
That's where you're wrong!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.433
Marty is my business.

07:55.434 --> 08:00.522
Okay.

08:02.399 --> 08:06.320
If he doesn't call me by this afternoon,
there's gonna be trouble.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.905
Well then, I guess there'll be trouble.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.824
-Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of trouble.
-No, I heard you the first time.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.743
-Kiss my fucking ass, Phyllis.
-Nice.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.161
Fucking bitch.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.412
Nice.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.165
Big smiles on three. One, two, three.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.586
Oh, my God. Okay. You know what?

08:22.669 --> 08:25.297
Forget smiling.
Just try to look less spooky.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.966
You look like the twins from The Shining
had another bunch of twins.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.470
Oh, Mr. Abelman, hold on one second, okay?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.431
Bruce, can you take over?
Just try to get 'em to smile.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.601
I mean, this hostage proof-of-life energy
is not working for me.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.808
I'll do my best.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.395
Let's see, you ordered

08:40.479 --> 08:42.563
the traveler curtain
in cotton velvet velour.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.317
-I did. With butterfly pleats.
-Yes.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.530
And as you can see it has
the directional pile and the matte finish.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.115
Is that Puccini? It seems dark.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.160
No, it's regular Puccini. I mean,
in this light it may look a little darker.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.370
-I don't--
-So we got you

08:56.453 --> 08:58.830
the sharkstooth gauze and two legs.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.082
Let me see the legs.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.503
What's that supposed to be?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.880
It's a velour leg in black.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.340
On the back.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.968
It's curtain lining.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
Why?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.179
It gives maximum opacity.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.974
I didn't order a curtain lining.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.517
Well, we just recommend that,

09:18.600 --> 09:22.187
you know, for new drapes,
to-- to finish the drapes,

09:22.271 --> 09:24.940
so you have your curtain lining to,
you know, extend the life span.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.442
Are you deaf? I didn't ask for it.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.740
Look, we-- we don't make it
without the curtain lining.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.158
-Oh, I bet you don't.
-I mean,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.828
-because it saves on wear and tear.
-Because you can charge more.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.125
-Listen.
-No, you listen.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.837
I didn't have to put up with this nonsense
when your father was in charge.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.255
I'm just trying to do what's best.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.465
Thirty-four years I've been coming here.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.843
-And we appreciate the business.
-Where's Jerome?

09:54.553 --> 09:56.555
-My uncle doesn't work here anymore.
-Why not?

09:56.638 --> 09:59.141
Because it's-- it's-- it's complicated.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.809
I want to speak to Jerome.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.690
Can you just hold on for one second?

10:38.555 --> 10:39.556
Mr. Abelman!

10:41.016 --> 10:43.060
Hi, how are you?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.938
I'm not paying a cent
until I've spoken to Jerome.

10:46.855 --> 10:47.856
I see.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.407
Could you give me one second, please?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.209
Marty, what are you doing?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.961
Now, you need to come out right now.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.506
Marty, stop it. Marty, put it down.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.841
Stop it.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.009
You're having a panic attack?

11:16.093 --> 11:17.344
What is the matter with you?

11:17.427 --> 11:18.929
What are you-- What are you afraid of?

11:19.012 --> 11:23.433
He's just a grouchy old Talmud teacher
who's had ear hair since he was 30.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.018
What are you so scared about?

11:27.396 --> 11:32.025
Marty, look at me. You're in charge now.
You're the boss.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.111
Bosses don't chew the fabric, Marty.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.613
What's the matter?
Marty, are you fainting?

11:36.697 --> 11:38.365
Get up. No, get up now. Stop it.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.242
You gotta get out there. You gotta…

11:40.325 --> 11:42.202
Stop it! Marty, get up.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.288
Are you kidding me right now?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.627
Goddamn it, Marty!

11:59.553 --> 12:03.098
I'm sorry, Marty is
in a very important meeting right now.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.266
Behind the curtain?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.685
Yes, behind the curtain. How can I help?

12:06.768 --> 12:09.897
He put a lining on my curtain leg.
I didn't ask for it.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.150
And if you don't take it off the invoice,
I'll take my business elsewhere.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.444
Well,
we'll certainly be sad to see you go.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.284
Your father would not be happy.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.702
No, true.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.331
But then again, he never was, so…

12:30.542 --> 12:31.877
Bye, Mr. Abelman.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.562
Come on.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.606
Come here.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.653
Oh, Marty.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.074
Look at you.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.203
You're a grown man
smooshed against the wall,

13:06.286 --> 13:09.873
hiding behind a wall of curtains
in your own office.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.127
I-- I had to get out of there.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.051
You need help, Marty.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.932
You gotta see Dr. Herschkopf.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.436
Hey, just one time.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.273
That's all I'm asking.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.325
Are you Marty?

14:28.952 --> 14:32.539
Welcome. Good to see you. Come.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.464
So, what brings you here?

14:40.547 --> 14:41.548
I don't know.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.843
I mean, that's the crazy thing.

14:46.637 --> 14:47.846
I-- I'm fine.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.682
Everything's fine. It's so silly.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.601
Yeah.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.438
Phyllis made me come.
That's the real reason.

14:56.522 --> 14:57.773
Phyllis?

14:57.856 --> 14:58.982
My sister.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.693
She must be very persuasive.

15:01.777 --> 15:02.778
Well…

15:04.530 --> 15:06.698
So why does Phyllis
think you need to come?

15:08.033 --> 15:10.536
-Come again?
-Why does Phyllis think you need to come?

15:10.619 --> 15:13.247
I literally have no idea. It's ridiculous.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.832
If I had to guess, I couldn't.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.126
Everything's great.
I don't have any problems.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.753
I mean, I'm good.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.173
I'm like a cool breeze.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.676
Don't hear that very often.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.095
Well, that's my story.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.110
I feel bad.
I feel like this is a waste of your time.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.529
I'm sorry.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.489
I'm gonna go.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.158
Well, look. Hey.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.410
Huh?

15:51.493 --> 15:52.578
You're here.

15:53.662 --> 15:54.913
Might as well stay.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.666
Just to keep Phyllis quiet, right?

15:57.749 --> 15:58.750
True.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.628
So funny. Have a seat.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.213
Relax.

16:03.297 --> 16:05.799
It's okay. We can just shoot the breeze.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.968
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.680
Is there any particular breeze
you'd like to shoot?

16:16.393 --> 16:17.728
All right.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.771
Well,
why don't you tell me about yourself?

16:22.232 --> 16:25.569
Well, not much to say.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.155
You know, born in New York.
Live in New York.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.657
Great job. Great life.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.744
You know? Nothing to say.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.289
You really don't wanna be here, do you?

16:37.372 --> 16:40.125
-Well, look--
-You know what?

16:40.209 --> 16:41.293
I think you're right.

16:41.376 --> 16:45.172
It's a beautiful day out.
Why don't we take a walk?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.465
A walk?

16:46.548 --> 16:47.549
Yeah.

16:48.509 --> 16:51.053
-Together?
-Sure. Why not?

16:57.226 --> 17:00.812
So, tell me about your great life.
I'm envious.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.732
Nothing really to tell.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.233
I love my job.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.529
I run a fabrics company.

17:09.569 --> 17:14.159
My dad used to run it, but now--
now my mom and dad are--

17:14.242 --> 17:17.538
Well, they're not-- you know,
they aren't, uh…

17:18.413 --> 17:20.123
They left it to me in their will.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.210
How long ago did they pass away?

17:24.545 --> 17:25.546
How long?

17:29.883 --> 17:31.051
Is it pretty recent?

17:35.013 --> 17:37.224
So now you're the boss, huh?

17:37.933 --> 17:38.934
You like that?

17:39.560 --> 17:40.561
Uh-huh.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.567
People who work for you,
they coping with the transition?

17:46.650 --> 17:48.819
Oh, yeah. Yeah. They're great.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.904
They're like a family.
I've known 'em my whole life.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.239
A great bunch of guys.

17:53.198 --> 17:56.243
I mean,
my uncle's suing me, but it's fine.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.327
He's suing you?

17:57.411 --> 17:59.079
Yeah. It's not a huge deal.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.164
Just, you know, normal family drama.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.250
He wants to run it.

18:03.333 --> 18:07.045
He doesn't think I can, but it'll be fine.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.506
Sounds pretty tough.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.634
No, really. It's fine.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.637
It's fine. It'll blow over.

18:18.557 --> 18:19.725
Are you married?

18:21.143 --> 18:24.396
I was seeing someone,
but we just split a few weeks ago.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.023
I'm so sorry.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.651
No. No, it's actually a good thing.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.570
I am so much better off without her.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.990
And the only problem is,
right before we split,

18:35.073 --> 18:37.159
I promised her a vacation to Mexico.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.578
And now she keeps showing up,

18:40.412 --> 18:42.998
saying that I owe her
a vacation to Mexico.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.250
You know.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.129
But apart from that,
everything really is--

18:49.213 --> 18:50.214
Fine?

18:50.297 --> 18:51.298
Yeah.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.555
Come on.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.640
Let's play.

19:00.682 --> 19:01.850
What?

19:01.934 --> 19:02.935
Basketball.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.480
Well, I don't really play all that much.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.525
Hi, guys. Need two more?

19:09.608 --> 19:10.901
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah? Okay.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.277
-Yeah. Can run with them.
-All right.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.071
I'll be on your team.
You be on their team.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.864
-I'm not great at basketball.
-That's okay.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.033
-I just wanna warm up.
-Ah, we're just having fun, man.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.160
-All right. Here we go.
-Vamos! Vamos! Vamos!

19:20.744 --> 19:22.287
-All right. Come on.
-All right.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.747
-Check up.
-Check up.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.041
-It's on! Right there! Right there!
-Move! Come on. Come on!

19:26.124 --> 19:27.751
Hey, you know what your problem is?

19:27.835 --> 19:30.462
Yeah, I can't run and bounce
at the same time. It's a hand-eye thing.

19:30.546 --> 19:33.173
-Your problem is you're good-looking.
-No.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.633
-Successful.
-Not really.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.926
-And you've got money.
-Maybe.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.179
And you're nice. You're too nice.
You let people take advantage of you.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.681
-You think so?
-Watch him!

19:41.473 --> 19:42.516
Marty! Pass me! Me!

19:42.599 --> 19:44.059
-Pass! Pass!
-Pass me the ball!

19:44.142 --> 19:45.644
Look where you're throwing.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.396
What were you doing, man?

19:47.479 --> 19:49.606
What are you doing?
He's not even on our team!

19:49.690 --> 19:51.316
Man, I was open in the paint all damn day.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.651
What's wrong with you?

19:52.734 --> 19:54.444
-He said.
-Man, come on.

19:54.528 --> 19:55.904
He said! You said!

19:56.697 --> 19:57.698
Why would you do that?

19:57.781 --> 20:00.075
-No, you did that.
-You--

20:00.158 --> 20:03.328
I just asked you for the ball.
You didn't need to pass it to me.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.082
-All right. Let's go again.
-Check in.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.876
Loser's ball. Loser's ball.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.170
Who are you?

20:11.253 --> 20:12.921
I'm Marty Markowitz.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.715
Are you Easy Mark Markowitz?

20:16.300 --> 20:17.301
No.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.512
You're a tough guy, right? What are you?

20:20.596 --> 20:23.223
-A tough guy.
-That didn't sound very tough.

20:23.307 --> 20:26.185
That sounded wispy.
Billowy. Are you billowy?

20:26.268 --> 20:29.271
-No. I'm not billowy.
-No, you're not. Of course you're not.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.940
-I don't think so.
-No!

20:32.816 --> 20:35.819
And what aren't you gonna put up with?

20:35.903 --> 20:38.655
-Well, here's the thing. I did promise--
-You're not gonna put up with

20:38.739 --> 20:40.699
-any more of her BS.
-Watch it.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.160
-And what's she gonna get from you?
-Well, she said--

20:43.243 --> 20:46.121
Nothing. Nothing.
Are you gonna tell her that?

20:46.205 --> 20:47.831
I mean, she can be pretty difficult.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.167
Do it now. Call her.

20:50.834 --> 20:54.254
Now? I don't think now is the right time.

20:54.338 --> 20:55.964
No time like the present.

20:56.465 --> 21:00.385
Look, I'll even donate my own dime. Here.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.806
This call is gonna cost you nothing,
but it's gonna save you $1,000.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.683
And your peace of mind.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.853
I don't think I'm ready.

21:09.937 --> 21:13.565
Marty, I'm right here.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.798
Hey, Deborah. It's Mar--

21:38.841 --> 21:39.842
I'm sorry.

21:39.925 --> 21:42.010
I just haven't-- I'm sorry.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.098
No, I-- Look, work's been crazy.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.683
-I-- I haven't been--
-You can do this.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.143
Listen.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.064
Here's the thing.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.569
I can't pay for you to go to Mexico
for a week.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.909
Uh-huh. Five days would be cheaper.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.327
-Yeah.
-No.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.831
Or-- Or would you consider
three days in Poughkeepsie?

22:10.914 --> 22:13.125
-I have a coupon. There's spa privileges.
-No.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.168
No.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.460
-I have one.
-It doesn't matter.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.380
-I have two coupons, actually.
-That's not what you…

22:18.463 --> 22:19.923
-I'm sorry.
-Marty.

22:22.009 --> 22:23.927
-I-- I-- I'm so--
-Marty.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.387
Please don't yell at me.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.680
You don't need to ye--

22:31.393 --> 22:34.271
Okay. Marty. Come on, come on.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.731
Oh, no. Oh, no, you--

22:35.814 --> 22:36.982
-Breathe. Breathe.
-Oh, God.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.942
You hung up on her.
That's not gonna be good.

22:39.026 --> 22:41.236
-You shouldn't have hung up on her.
-It's okay. You all right?

22:41.320 --> 22:43.447
-Yeah.
-I feel you sweating through your coat.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.365
-I'm gonna pass out.
-You're not gonna pass out.

22:45.449 --> 22:46.700
You're not gonna pass out.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.536
We're right here. Okay? We're right here.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.247
-Let me get the-- Let me get this.
-Yeah. Okay.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.333
-Just a little bit further to go.
-Okay.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.835
Hey, Joe. Do you have, maybe,
a seat, a chair,

22:56.919 --> 22:58.629
maybe a glass of water for my friend,
please?

22:58.712 --> 22:59.922
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, yeah. No, it's okay.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.465
Just relax. Just breathe.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.175
-Thank you.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.468
Here, sit down. Sit down.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.969
-Relax.
-Yeah.

23:06.053 --> 23:10.724
That's it. Breathe, okay? Just breathe.
Deeply. All right, in. Breathe in.

23:11.517 --> 23:14.102
One, two, three, four.

23:14.186 --> 23:17.189
Breathe out. Two, three, four.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.651
Breathe in. Thank you.
Great. You're doing great. Here.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.277
-Okay. Thank you.
-Have a few sips.

23:24.947 --> 23:26.156
-You're okay.
-Thank you.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.366
All right, breathe in.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.620
-I'm okay.
-Breathe out. There you go, yes.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.956
Is that the kind of advice
you charge all that money for?

23:34.623 --> 23:36.500
That's eight years of training
right there.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.169
-Great.
-Wow.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.963
-How you feeling?
-Yeah, much-- much better.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.339
-Better? You look better.
-Yeah.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.423
-Yeah.
-Yeah, good.

23:43.507 --> 23:45.551
-Thank you.
-You were a little green around the gills.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.886
-I apologize.
-Not at all. No need.

23:47.970 --> 23:51.723
Say, Doc, I don't know, but I have
those items ready if you want them.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.227
Yeah. Okay, sure. Great.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.105
How you feeling?

23:58.188 --> 23:59.481
-Yeah. Good.
-Yeah?

23:59.565 --> 24:01.441
-I think I'm all right. Yeah. I just--
-Good.

24:01.525 --> 24:04.403
-All right. What do you think?
-Hey, all right!

24:04.486 --> 24:05.779
That's it. You're doing terrific.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.741
I li-- Hey.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.452
Marty.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.207
What do you think? Recognize her?

24:18.709 --> 24:19.710
I don't think so.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.337
You don't recognize Jackie Stallone?

24:23.964 --> 24:25.507
Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling?

24:27.217 --> 24:29.678
-Oh. Yeah.
-Right. Right, right, right.

24:30.429 --> 24:31.638
Look, here's another--

24:31.722 --> 24:34.683
This is just a letter I had published
in The New York Times.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.643
About the death penalty.

24:39.521 --> 24:40.522
Trenchant.

24:44.985 --> 24:49.823
Would-- would it be better
if the photo had a mat?

24:49.907 --> 24:53.994
Then the frames could be the same size.
Like, they'd balance each other.

24:55.037 --> 24:58.290
-You know, I think he might be right.
-Do you want me to do that? I can do that.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.752
Then if you use a green mat,
it'll pick up the green in your shirt.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.379
-You after my job?
-No. No.

25:05.422 --> 25:06.715
He's got a real eye.

25:07.508 --> 25:10.719
You want to take this one?
And then I'll adjust the Jackie Stallone?

25:12.554 --> 25:13.597
-Sure.
-Great.

25:16.850 --> 25:17.893
You're very good at this.

25:19.311 --> 25:22.314
I work with fabrics. I know about color.

25:22.397 --> 25:25.025
Why does your uncle say
you can't run the company?

25:25.108 --> 25:26.401
Because I can't.

25:27.152 --> 25:28.570
His words or yours?

25:28.654 --> 25:31.823
My words, which I know
everyone is secretly thinking.

25:31.907 --> 25:34.368
-I can't do it.
-I don't think that's true.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.452
You don't know me.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.412
I don't believe that about anyone.

25:38.539 --> 25:42.793
Every single human being
on the face of the earth can change.

25:43.377 --> 25:47.172
And they can strive
and improve themselves.

25:47.256 --> 25:48.590
They just have to want to.

25:49.258 --> 25:50.884
And you believe that to be true?

25:51.593 --> 25:54.054
My father told me
I wouldn't amount to anything.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.390
Look at me now.

25:57.975 --> 25:59.643
He was a Holocaust survivor.

26:00.477 --> 26:01.645
He's a hero.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.065
What do you do when a hero tells you
you're a loser?

26:05.148 --> 26:06.441
I don't know.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.652
Prove them wrong.

26:14.408 --> 26:18.036
All right. So, that is $37.

26:18.954 --> 26:22.666
You know what?
I left my wallet in the office.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.835
That's okay. I'll keep it till next time.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.628
I didn't know I was coming out. Shoot.

26:26.712 --> 26:27.754
It'll keep.

26:27.838 --> 26:29.214
Yeah.

26:29.298 --> 26:32.676
You know, I could pay you
for the session now. In cash.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.011
-Really?
-Sure.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.014
You know what--
It's fine, you don't have to.

26:37.097 --> 26:40.017
No, no, no. I want to.
Look, I owe you money. I should pay.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.185
No. I can come back.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.228
-It's okay.
-If there's one thing I'm good at,

26:43.312 --> 26:44.438
it's my accounts.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.565
I'm not gonna be the guy
who doesn't pay his bills.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.234
-It's fine. I don't--
-You're doing me a favor.

26:49.318 --> 26:52.196
You're saving me from writing a check
and having to mail it to you.

26:53.113 --> 26:56.867
Okay. Okay. Then, well, thank you.
It's-- I appreciate it.

26:56.950 --> 27:00.329
-Absolutely.
-Well, that's very, very kind of you.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.706
Let's see, it's 45, right?

27:02.789 --> 27:04.416
-Right, yes.
-Right?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.127
-It is 45.
-Yeah.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.089
Is-- Is that not 45?

27:11.173 --> 27:12.674
Right. No, no, it is.

27:12.758 --> 27:15.928
It's just-- It's-- It's 45 per hour.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.679
And we went over.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.307
Right. But you know what?
Don't worry. It's on me.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.309
No, no, no. I wanna pay the exact amount.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.728
Don't be silly. It's fine.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.230
-Absolutely not.
-Marty.

27:26.730 --> 27:27.731
Please.

27:27.814 --> 27:28.941
Let's see.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.817
-It's been an hour, 15.
-You don't--

27:30.901 --> 27:32.236
So, what would that be?

27:32.319 --> 27:33.987
Well, if you go into the second hour

27:34.071 --> 27:36.073
then I have to charge you
for the full hour.

27:36.156 --> 27:39.785
-Right, right, of course. No.
-But, honestly, it's fine.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.620
-Would you stop?
-No. This is what I wanna do.

27:41.703 --> 27:42.704
I'm trying to--

27:42.788 --> 27:44.373
-We're gonna do this.
-This-- I mean…

27:44.456 --> 27:45.791
-Enough already.
-$90. I insist.

27:45.874 --> 27:49.002
-Marty, no. No. It's fine.
-It's done.

27:49.086 --> 27:51.755
-It's do-- It's not--
-The money's in your hand.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.262
Thank you, Marty.

27:58.345 --> 28:00.055
-You're something else.
-There you go.

28:00.138 --> 28:01.139
-Joe, I'm gonna…
-Thank you.

28:01.223 --> 28:02.641
-Oh, no, I got it.
-…give you your stool.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.810
-That was so kind of you, Joe.
-Come on, no. I got it.

28:04.893 --> 28:05.894
You are right though.

28:05.978 --> 28:08.814
I think with a beveled edge
and a green mat,

28:08.897 --> 28:10.649
-it's going to look…
-Where I'm coming from…

28:10.732 --> 28:12.234
-…really nice.
-This shop is wonderful.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.444
Because you see it in the vest.
Marty, you know what?

28:14.528 --> 28:16.780
We still have a little bit of time left
in your session.

28:16.864 --> 28:19.366
So, you know what I think we should do?

28:19.992 --> 28:21.952
Take care of that Mexico business.

28:23.579 --> 28:25.163
-Thank you, Joe.
-Yeah. See you soon.

28:40.179 --> 28:41.930
I really don't think this is a good idea.

28:42.014 --> 28:44.141
In fact,
it could turn out to be a terrible idea.

28:44.224 --> 28:47.060
We're both gonna probably end up
buying her trips to Mexico.

28:47.144 --> 28:48.437
I'm not going to let that happen.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.481
You say that, but you don't know her.
You can't argue with her.

28:51.565 --> 28:55.402
She's like Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka,
but with her brain.

28:55.485 --> 28:58.322
You think you're winning,
then she ends up flying off the top rope

28:58.405 --> 29:00.115
and getting you in a headlock,
and it's over.

29:00.199 --> 29:02.868
Okay, well, put your leotards on,
'cause you can do this.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.043
She's not here, so--

29:11.126 --> 29:13.545
-Oh, my God, Marty. Finally.
-What "Oh, my God"?

29:13.629 --> 29:16.423
You get cut off on the phone,
you call back. That's the way life works.

29:16.507 --> 29:17.508
You don't understand life.

29:17.591 --> 29:19.218
-When you get cut…
-You didn't have to scream.

29:19.301 --> 29:21.136
-I wasn't screaming.
-You were screaming.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.346
I was not screaming.

29:23.013 --> 29:26.683
Fine. I-- Look, I--
Okay, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

29:26.767 --> 29:30.312
I get it. I get it. It's over.
But you promised me a trip to Mexico.

29:30.395 --> 29:33.524
And I found an ocean view at a hotel
in Cancún which has everything included…

29:33.607 --> 29:35.317
Okay. Well, that's--

29:38.403 --> 29:39.488
Unacceptable.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.656
Who are you?

29:41.448 --> 29:43.492
-Who is this?
-Marty is my client.

29:43.575 --> 29:46.286
Your client? You brought a lawyer?

29:49.373 --> 29:51.166
Marty will not be paying
for a trip to Mexico.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.251
But he promised.

29:52.334 --> 29:54.670
Any promise Marty made
was made verbally and not in writing.

29:54.753 --> 29:57.548
-Who gives a shit?
-It was also made in good faith,

29:57.631 --> 29:59.132
assuming the relationship was ongoing.

29:59.216 --> 30:00.801
No, he never said anything about that.

30:00.884 --> 30:04.555
I said I'd always wanted to go to Mexico,
and Marty said he would pay. Marty?

30:04.638 --> 30:06.348
You said you would pay. Right?

30:09.434 --> 30:11.854
-Are you trying to take advantage of him?
-No.

30:11.937 --> 30:13.313
It sounds like you are.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.148
Do you really want to be
that kind of person?

30:15.232 --> 30:16.942
No. He said.

30:17.776 --> 30:18.819
Marty, tell him.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.154
You said it. You said that you would pay.

30:21.238 --> 30:22.990
I can't speak to what he said before,

30:23.073 --> 30:25.367
but I can hear quite clearly
what he's saying now.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.327
And what he's saying is, "no more."

30:28.287 --> 30:30.622
Marty says you are to cease
and desist from calling,

30:30.706 --> 30:32.040
from coming to his workplace,

30:32.124 --> 30:36.420
and from any and all contact from him
or with any member of his family.

30:37.629 --> 30:40.090
Marty also says if you do not cease
and desist,

30:40.174 --> 30:43.343
he will not hesitate to use
the full force of the law against you.

30:43.427 --> 30:46.763
Marty says he will not be paying
for a trip to Mexico.

30:46.847 --> 30:49.391
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

30:49.474 --> 30:52.269
Marty also says,
if you continue in this vein,

30:52.352 --> 30:55.647
the only view your room will have
is a view of the prison yard.

31:00.861 --> 31:01.862
Martin.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.239
Did you say that?

31:05.741 --> 31:07.993
I said something very much to that effect.

31:10.454 --> 31:11.914
This meeting has been documented.

31:12.873 --> 31:13.874
Good day.

31:13.957 --> 31:15.501
It has been documented, so…

31:15.584 --> 31:16.835
Get out of my apartment.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.133
Oh, my God.

31:23.217 --> 31:25.761
-Did you see her face?
-I feel like I'm on drugs.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.513
I mean, I've never taken them before, but,

31:27.596 --> 31:29.640
I mean,
I assume this is what drugs feel like.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.683
-You feel good?
-I feel amazing.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.685
Wait, "view of the prison yard"?

31:34.770 --> 31:36.021
That was a stroke of genius.

31:36.104 --> 31:38.398
-It was, wasn't it? Give me five.
-Yeah.

31:38.482 --> 31:40.025
-Give me ten.
-Yeah.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.610
-Give me seven and a half.
-What's that?

31:41.693 --> 31:43.904
It's nothing. I'm messing around.

31:43.987 --> 31:47.241
Ah, you did it, Marty.
You stood up for yourself.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.034
Yeah.

31:51.161 --> 31:52.746
You're a good man, Marty.

31:54.331 --> 31:57.709
I'm fairly busy, but I like you.
And I think I could help you.

31:59.503 --> 32:00.504
Okay.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.172
You let people use you.

32:03.215 --> 32:05.133
I'm not gonna let anyone use you.

32:05.217 --> 32:07.719
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

32:08.387 --> 32:09.388
Sound good?

32:11.306 --> 32:13.308
Yeah. That sounds good.

32:14.393 --> 32:15.727
I'm gonna help you.

32:16.311 --> 32:18.146
And everything's gonna be all right.

32:20.524 --> 32:23.068
And the first thing I'm going to do
is completely unethical.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.361
I'm gonna give you a hug.

32:25.279 --> 32:26.280
I'm a hugger.

32:30.450 --> 32:31.743
-Hey.
-What?

32:31.827 --> 32:33.620
Look at those. How cool are they?

32:35.289 --> 32:37.082
Oh, yeah. Very cool.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.877
I'm gonna buy those one day.

32:46.133 --> 32:48.677
I feel like we robbed a bank or something.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.887
-Right?
-Almost.

32:49.970 --> 32:52.139
-I mean, the adrenaline.
-I know, I do.

32:52.222 --> 32:53.515
I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

32:54.266 --> 32:55.684
You know what? Have a mint tea.
