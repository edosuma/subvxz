01:27.155 --> 01:28.322
[gunshot]

01:40.634 --> 01:41.669
[rifle cocked]

02:16.704 --> 02:18.806
There's no point
in hiding, missy.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.377
I'm going to find you.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.827
Fuck!

03:21.001 --> 03:22.870
Uhh!

03:22.936 --> 03:24.272
Let's go.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.479
Where's the truck?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.913
I don't know. Come on.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.625
Damn, I left my gun
in the truck.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.630
Which way?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.566
Where'd they go?

03:54.368 --> 03:55.836
What's he doing?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.438
I think
he's helping us.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.702
I moved it around back.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.640
Why are you helping us?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.141
Because
he's a fucking maniac.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.643
Why else do you think?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.578
You better get out of here
before he comes back.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.813
We're going, but we need
to talk to somebody first.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.449
Lemuel Washington.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.750
The diner's closed.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.819
Yeah, I see that.
You know where he lives?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.365
[click]

05:13.747 --> 05:15.082
[clicking]

05:16.384 --> 05:17.551
[click]

05:21.389 --> 05:22.890
[clicking]

05:29.296 --> 05:30.831
[gunshots]

05:33.401 --> 05:35.403
[knock on door]

05:45.713 --> 05:47.848
[pounding]

05:49.016 --> 05:51.752
[pounding]

05:58.158 --> 05:59.493
We got to talk, Frank.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.595
I got nothing to say.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.263
How about you tell me
what you're doing with a gun?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.433
Shh! Keep your
damn voice down.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.605
It's for protection.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.941
- Protection?
- Do you blame me?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.709
After what happened?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.445
Do you know
what the Pons will do

06:17.445 --> 06:18.646
if they catch you with a gun?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.080
I got to do something,
Ed. Do you get that?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.449
I can't just do nothing.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.584
Buddy, there's nothing
you can do,

06:23.651 --> 06:25.285
except you take it.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.087
You take it, or you
get yourself killed.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.575
- Frank.
- What?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.711
You're not going to do
something stupid, are you?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.513
- No.
- Then what?

06:52.580 --> 06:53.514
What is it?
Is it revenge?

06:53.581 --> 06:55.115
Are you going
to take a shot

06:55.182 --> 06:57.017
at that cop
that killed Laura
and her kids?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.686
I'm tired, okay?
I'm really tired.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.121
- I don't--
- Go home. Just go home.
Come on.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.256
Out. Come on.
Get out of here.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.357
Ed, leave.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.494
Oh, shit.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.128
You're not going
to take a shot--

07:08.195 --> 07:10.230
- Are you crazy?
- Just fucking leave!

07:10.297 --> 07:12.099
The prince had nothing
to do with what
happened to Laura.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.067
You kill a cop, and a thousand
cops will take his place.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.903
You kill that prince,
their god,

07:15.969 --> 07:19.339
you drive a stake right
through their fucking hearts.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.542
You do that,
and your life is over.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.076
It's already over.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.715
What about Juliana?

07:29.883 --> 07:30.884
Juliana?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.553
She--

07:35.422 --> 07:37.958
She's left me, okay?
She's gone.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.328
No, Frank. That's not true.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.164
Jules loves you,
and you know that.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.667
Now, no matter
what's happened,

07:46.734 --> 07:48.435
she's going to come
back here,

07:48.536 --> 07:49.903
and she's going
to be here for you,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.539
just like you were
there for her

07:51.539 --> 07:52.873
when she needed you.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.274
No.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.309
Frank, please.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.045
Don't give up.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.551
Buddy, please promise me
that you won't give up.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.986
Please promise me.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.893
All right. All right.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.563
I'll get rid of the gun.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.934
I don't know where
I was going to find
bullets for it anyway.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.904
Okay, good. Why don't you
give it to me? I'll do it.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.806
No. No, no.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.474
I'll take care of it.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.109
I promise.

08:30.911 --> 08:31.979
Okay.

08:58.806 --> 09:03.276
Hi.
I like your doll.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.212
What's her name?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.647
Annie.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.282
Annie. That's
my mother's name.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.121
You kids come on inside.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.795
What the hell
are you doing here?

09:23.631 --> 09:24.832
We need to speak
to you.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.333
How do you know where I live?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.768
We came to warn you.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.637
Warn me about what?

09:29.637 --> 09:31.371
We found your name

09:31.438 --> 09:34.207
on a list,
right below my sister's.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.446
This motherfucker
stays by the truck.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.649
You come inside.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.350
Hey, hold on a second.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.719
It's okay.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.667
Hey, honey, take
the kids upstairs.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.802
It's okay.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.746
Sit down.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.594
Your sister's name
is Trudy Walker?

10:27.661 --> 10:29.863
She was supposed
to bring you the film.

10:29.930 --> 10:34.367
They shot her,
and I took her place.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.936
What is your name?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.071
Juliana.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.340
Juliana Crain.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.009
We were half-sisters.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.279
Then you saw my name on what,
some kind of list?

10:46.346 --> 10:49.817
There was a man at the diner,
the one who made paper animals.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.920
And, uh, when no one else
approached me,

10:52.986 --> 10:55.088
I thought he was my contact.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.091
He tried to kill me.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.262
It went the other way.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.431
Where's the body?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.199
In the river.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.268
We sunk it.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.937
You and him?

11:12.740 --> 11:17.811
Look, we found a woman
that this man had tortured.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.384
You knew her?

11:29.757 --> 11:31.291
Uh-huh.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.895
Her name was Linda.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.865
She disappeared
a few days ago.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.599
Well, she must have given
him the list of names.

11:39.666 --> 11:43.170
They were all crossed off
except for my sister's

11:43.236 --> 11:44.271
and yours.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.407
We're dead.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.176
Maybe not.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.980
Nobody's seen the list
except for us.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.020
You were my sister's
contact, Lem,

12:00.087 --> 12:01.421
and you didn't tell me.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.890
I didn't trust you.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.325
I sure as hell
don't trust him.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.462
Have you seen the films?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.498
It's not my job to see them.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.566
I just pass them along.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.103
Then you don't know
what they mean.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.205
I just know
they help kill Nazis.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.244
Now you give me
that goddamn film.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.614
And you get the hell
out of my house.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.250
I'm not giving you
the film,

12:30.317 --> 12:31.684
not anymore.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.620
I'll give it to the man
you give it to.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.122
That ain't how it works.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.024
Look, I'm not here
to kill Nazis.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.827
I'm here because
I need answers,

12:39.827 --> 12:41.995
and I'm not leaving
until I get them.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.865
Who is it, Lem?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.934
Who is it you give
the films to?

13:03.450 --> 13:04.617
Well?

13:04.684 --> 13:07.387
Tomorrow morning,
Spirit Alley Trail.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.922
What's there?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.557
He's going to take me
to meet the man

13:10.623 --> 13:13.326
he's supposed
to give my film to.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.862
Who's that?

13:14.862 --> 13:16.563
The Man
in the High Castle.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.106
[ring]

13:28.441 --> 13:29.442
[ring]

13:29.509 --> 13:30.543
[groan]

13:32.312 --> 13:33.746
[ring]

13:33.881 --> 13:35.148
Hello.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.550
Joe: It's me,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.520
Joe. It's two hours--

13:40.587 --> 13:42.322
I know, sir.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.192
But I've made contact
with the Resistance
operative.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.361
John.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.897
You hold on, Joe.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.170
Smith: Okay, Helen.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.705
[click]

13:58.771 --> 14:00.507
So this contact,

14:00.573 --> 14:02.409
did he ask for the film?

14:02.475 --> 14:05.012
No, I told him I'd only
give it to his superior.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.048
I suppose
you got a name.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.984
He said it's the Man
in the High Castle.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.555
The Man
in the High Castle?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.290
Yes, sir.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.328
I want you to proceed
with great caution, Joe.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.466
These are very dangerous
men you're dealing with.

14:29.937 --> 14:30.938
I understand.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.473
No. You think you understand.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.944
I know you're very
motivated, Joe,

14:37.010 --> 14:38.511
but you're young.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.814
you suffer from
the arrogance of ignorance.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.150
Yes, sir.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.152
So what are my orders,
sir?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.987
If I do meet the Man
In the High Castle,

14:47.054 --> 14:48.521
do I give him the film?

14:48.588 --> 14:49.990
No.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.659
You leave the film
in the truck.

14:54.494 --> 14:59.332
This is going to be very
hard for you to hear, Joe,

14:59.399 --> 15:04.204
but if you are taken
to the Man In the High Castle,

15:04.271 --> 15:07.440
I want you to put
a bullet in his head...

15:09.776 --> 15:11.979
even if it costs you
your life.

15:13.713 --> 15:16.216
Are you prepared
to do that, Joe?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.054
Yes...

15:22.255 --> 15:24.124
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.660
When's this meeting
due to happen?

15:27.727 --> 15:29.262
Tomorrow morning.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.299
Then I'll await
your call.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.467
If I don't hear
from you, Joe...

15:36.203 --> 15:39.439
no matter what happened...

15:39.506 --> 15:42.242
you'll receive
a hero's funeral...

15:44.011 --> 15:45.512
with full honors.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.016
Thank you, sir.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.052
Heil Hitler.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.155
Heil Hitler.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.097
[speaking Japanese]

17:10.097 --> 17:13.800
I need your guidance,
Tagomi-San.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.103
My husband is troubled.

17:16.169 --> 17:20.307
He fears our grip on
the Empire is loosening.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.743
I have heard these fears
expressed by others,

17:23.810 --> 17:24.911
Your Highness.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.146
Of course.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.681
You speak to people
from many nations

17:28.748 --> 17:30.717
in your work,

17:30.783 --> 17:32.819
but do you feel

17:32.885 --> 17:36.123
that that fear is valid?

17:36.123 --> 17:38.391
One thing is certain:

17:38.458 --> 17:41.628
the Nazis covet
our territories,

17:41.694 --> 17:44.764
none more so
than the Pacific States.

17:44.831 --> 17:49.469
If they perceive weakness,
they will strike.

17:51.638 --> 17:55.442
The generals wish my husband
to make a war cry

17:55.508 --> 17:59.212
to frighten the Nazis
so they back down.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.648
But he--

18:04.351 --> 18:07.787
he believes
such threats are hollow,

18:07.854 --> 18:11.224
that we must seek for peace.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.474
It will be seen as weakness,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.510
but the Prince is not weak.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.415
Peace is not weakness.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.353
Forces may yet emerge

18:40.420 --> 18:43.656
that will allow him
to move toward peace
with strength.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.458
What forces?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.903
I hope you're right,
Tagomi-San.

19:00.207 --> 19:04.411
But I fear these forces
will arrive too late.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.590
Marshal: Closing kind of
early, aren't you?

19:22.229 --> 19:24.564
One of my boys has a fever.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.434
I'm going home
to check on him.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.836
Any sign of that waitress?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.239
Nope.

19:33.706 --> 19:38.345
And if I said that you
were a fucking liar?

19:40.247 --> 19:42.715
You can kill me any time,
Marshal.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.953
That doesn't change
my answer.

19:47.019 --> 19:53.493
You're not afraid to die,
are you, Mr. Washington?

19:57.129 --> 19:58.498
Sure, I am.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.869
Better take care
of those strays of yours.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.204
There's not a lot
of doctors around here,

20:05.272 --> 20:10.243
and kids,
they can die of anything.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.972
You got the film?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.107
[film can clanks]

20:41.173 --> 20:42.475
Yeah.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.445
I can do this on my own.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.916
I can't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.888
Let's go.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.525
[knock on door]

22:08.194 --> 22:10.196
Mr. Tagomi. I--

22:10.262 --> 22:12.264
I wasn't expecting you
until later.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.000
It was urgent
I speak to you.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.435
I brought some--

22:18.938 --> 22:20.006
She's just leaving.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.323
You shouldn't
have taken such a risk.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.892
She could be working
for the Kempeitai.

22:39.959 --> 22:44.130
No Japanese spy would do
the things that woman did.

22:44.196 --> 22:49.502
You cope with stress
by throwing sticks,
Mr. Tagomi.

22:49.569 --> 22:53.072
I avail myself
a more earthly means.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.875
The Imperial Guard

22:55.942 --> 22:59.579
has approved the seating
for the speech.

22:59.646 --> 23:02.449
I have you sitting next
to the Science Minister.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.785
Place the envelope
in his coat pocket

23:05.852 --> 23:08.087
while the Prince
is speaking.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.922
After the address,

23:09.989 --> 23:13.059
you'll never have
access to him again.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.999
Joe: How much farther?

23:21.333 --> 23:23.335
Lemuel: Not that far.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.472
Juliana: Can you
explain something to me?

23:25.538 --> 23:27.974
You've never seen a film.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.377
You're risking your life
for them, your family's lives.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.112
Why?

23:33.179 --> 23:35.782
I do my part.
That's all.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.919
And you have no idea
how he makes them?

23:39.986 --> 23:41.488
Who?

23:41.488 --> 23:43.790
The Man In the High Castle.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.995
He doesn't make them,
does he?

23:49.061 --> 23:50.897
You don't think
we'd waste all this time

23:50.963 --> 23:53.500
collecting his films
to give them back
to him, do you?

23:57.770 --> 24:01.207
So why does he want them?
And where do they come from?

24:05.311 --> 24:06.713
We're here.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.082
Where is he?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.421
He's not coming.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.723
[rifle cocked]

24:20.627 --> 24:22.161
What is this, Lem?

24:22.228 --> 24:23.696
Give me the film.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.743
Get on your knees.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.953
Are you going
to shoot us, Lem?

24:47.019 --> 24:48.688
I wouldn't have
if you hadn't brought

24:48.755 --> 24:50.890
this goose-stepping
motherfucker along with you.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.294
The cell he was from
in New York

24:55.361 --> 24:56.863
was hit by the S.S.,

24:56.929 --> 24:59.165
just as he got
in his goddamn truck.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.167
What c-cell? What cell?

25:01.233 --> 25:03.636
I wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.972
- I'm with the Resistance.
- Bullshit.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.074
He's the only one
who got out of that shop,

25:08.140 --> 25:10.442
which means either
the Nazis got sloppy,

25:10.577 --> 25:12.078
which they do not do,

25:12.144 --> 25:15.948
or they wanted him to escape
because he's one of them.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.349
It's real.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.718
Joe: Believe me now?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.386
He helped me.

25:20.452 --> 25:23.189
He tried to warn you
about your name on that list.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.591
He used you.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.593
He used you to get
to the Man In the High Castle.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.994
Why else would he be here?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.328
Okay.

25:29.395 --> 25:30.597
I'm a Nazi...

25:31.898 --> 25:33.600
then why do I bring this?

25:33.633 --> 25:34.901
[rifle cocks]

26:06.398 --> 26:07.667
Film's good.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.274
If you make it back to town,
the Marshal will kill you.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.079
So where do we go?

26:21.413 --> 26:22.849
Cripple Creek.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.717
It's the other side
of that mountain.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.318
That's impossible.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.187
We can never
make that climb.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.421
You have to help us,
Lem.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.658
I can't. I'm sorry.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.771
[speaking Japanese]

26:50.677 --> 26:52.311
[footsteps]

27:04.023 --> 27:05.825
You're not fooling
anybody.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.695
I know you watch
those Japanese shows.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.832
If you've come home for lunch,
you're out of luck.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.768
I haven't gone
to the market yet.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.937
I talked to Bob Perloff.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.973
He has Frank's sister
on his mail route.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.344
Annie,
I've got some bad news.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.741
Good afternoon.
May I help you?

27:55.742 --> 27:56.843
I hope so.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.878
I'm looking for a rather
unusual item.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.580
Well, you've come
to the right place.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.015
American Artistic
Handcrafts

28:03.082 --> 28:06.585
is a veritable cornucopia
of the recherchÃ©.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.454
What did you have in mind?

28:12.324 --> 28:13.926
Antique bullets.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.295
The kind that fit
the old Colt .45.

28:19.665 --> 28:22.969
Sir, even if I had
such an item,

28:23.035 --> 28:24.303
I'm sure you're aware

28:24.370 --> 28:26.272
that the sales of ammunition
are restricted

28:26.338 --> 28:28.540
and strictly illegal
to sell to non-Japanese.

28:28.607 --> 28:30.176
Yes. Yeah. Look, I was hoping

28:30.242 --> 28:34.113
you might make an exception
for a highly motivated buyer.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.284
[door opens, bell tinkles]

28:41.153 --> 28:42.421
Pardon me.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.293
[speaking Japanese]

28:48.360 --> 28:50.797
We have passed by your
store many times

28:50.797 --> 28:52.398
and always meant to come in.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.835
I am most honored
by your splendid presence.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.244
Man:
You have such fine pieces.

29:05.311 --> 29:10.449
This mirror, it dates back
to the American War of 1812,

29:10.516 --> 29:11.450
I would guess.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.052
You have a keen eye.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.486
What a pleasure it is

29:14.553 --> 29:16.222
to speak with someone
who has an appreciation

29:16.288 --> 29:18.024
for American traditional
ethnic art.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.959
I'm afraid
I spend my morning

29:20.026 --> 29:22.028
trying to educate a gaggle
of white-sock yokels

29:22.094 --> 29:23.195
- in from the sticks.
- Excuse me.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.597
Excuse me. Sorry.
Sorry to interrupt,

29:25.664 --> 29:29.235
but we were in the middle
of a transaction.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.705
Perhaps we will
come back another time.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.342
Oh, please, that's not--

29:37.476 --> 29:40.847
Uh, I will be waiting.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.300
Close the doors.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.110
Only three?

30:11.177 --> 30:13.512
This is an antique
store, not an armory,

30:13.579 --> 30:14.981
and I can't guarantee
they'll fire.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.348
They're 100 yen apiece.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.722
300.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.191
What is that?

30:25.257 --> 30:28.027
I'm required by law
to keep a registry

30:28.094 --> 30:29.862
of all sales
of restricted items.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.864
So these bullets
were purchased

30:31.931 --> 30:33.432
by Mr. Satoshi Matsuda,

30:33.499 --> 30:36.602
a collector on his way
back to Tibet.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.671
But I will need to see
your identity card

30:39.738 --> 30:42.541
on the chance
I need to revisit
this matter with you,

30:42.608 --> 30:44.143
and that is
non-negotiable.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.981
All right, all right.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.253
Come on.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.922
I suggest

30:55.988 --> 30:57.689
you work on your patience,

30:57.756 --> 31:00.192
Mr. Frink.

31:22.949 --> 31:23.950
Hello?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.484
Frank?

31:25.551 --> 31:26.718
[gasp]

31:26.785 --> 31:28.120
Jesus. Anne.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.189
Did I scare you?
I'm sorry.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.158
No, it's okay, it's okay.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.229
Nobody answered,
so I just used my key.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.132
Where's Juliana?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.569
Uh, at the dojo, I think.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.972
You think she could spend

31:45.972 --> 31:48.240
a little less time
flippin' Japs

31:48.307 --> 31:50.109
and a little more time
doing housework.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.543
This place is a mess.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.417
Frank, what happened
to your face?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.519
Uh, it was
an accident at work.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.553
It's nothing.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.463
I heard about Laura
and the kids.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.703
I'm so sorry.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.410
Who told you?

32:24.476 --> 32:26.678
Arnold heard it.

32:30.816 --> 32:34.553
It's just awful.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.425
That cut.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.096
Frank, they haven't
bothered you, have they?

32:44.163 --> 32:45.464
No, no. I'm fine.

32:45.531 --> 32:46.865
I have work to do.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.134
No.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.903
You're awfully good.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.405
At what?

32:53.472 --> 32:54.573
Lying.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.243
Yeah, well...

32:57.309 --> 32:59.378
Why didn't you tell me?

33:00.579 --> 33:02.514
Because I have orders.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.350
Orders.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.118
We're on the same side,

33:06.185 --> 33:08.054
and your orders say
you can't tell me.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.057
[sigh]

33:12.591 --> 33:14.126
What's it like?

33:15.761 --> 33:16.762
What's what like?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.931
The Resistance.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.633
Not the best man to ask.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.734
It's my first mission.

33:22.801 --> 33:23.769
Oh, yeah?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.071
Yeah.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.705
I'm not off
to a good start.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.075
You got the film where it was
supposed to go, didn't you?

33:29.108 --> 33:30.342
Eventually, I guess.

33:30.409 --> 33:31.710
What did you
think of it?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.145
I didn't watch it.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.980
Come on, Joe.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.782
You're not supposed to.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.984
It's not like I have
a projector in
the truck anyway.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.452
You weren't
even tempted

33:40.519 --> 33:42.354
to hold it
up to the light
or something?

33:42.421 --> 33:43.455
No.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.243
Ahem.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.645
What is it, Captain?

34:06.712 --> 34:09.281
We've completed our review
of the phone records

34:09.348 --> 34:11.250
of the six officers
outside yourself

34:11.317 --> 34:12.584
who had access
to your travel routes

34:12.651 --> 34:16.355
and to the routes of
HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Lautz.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.124
And?

34:19.358 --> 34:21.127
Sir, there's
absolutely no evidence

34:21.127 --> 34:22.461
of a security breach

34:22.528 --> 34:24.463
of any kind.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.837
And yet we know there was
a security breach?

34:31.903 --> 34:33.572
Yes, sir.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.374
So what you're telling me,
Captain Connolly,

34:35.441 --> 34:37.376
is that you've failed.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.510
Sir--

34:38.577 --> 34:41.413
You're not allowed
to fail, Captain.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.716
Do you understand me?

34:44.783 --> 34:47.553
Not when it involves
a coordinated attack

34:47.619 --> 34:49.188
on the high command.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.660
The Semite I brought in,

34:54.726 --> 34:56.027
the one who shot at me,

34:56.162 --> 34:59.698
did you manage to locate
any members of his family?

34:59.765 --> 35:02.534
Yes. Yes, we did.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.171
He has two brothers,

35:05.171 --> 35:06.938
one in the Neutral Zone

35:07.005 --> 35:08.707
and another
in the Pacific States.

35:08.774 --> 35:13.345
Well, let's pay him
a little visit, shall we?

35:32.831 --> 35:36.067
Why was a prisoner on
suicide watch given a spoon?

35:36.202 --> 35:37.603
He wasn't.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.471
It wasn't on the tray
when I brought it.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.574
It-- It couldn't have been.
I-- I would have seen it.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.649
Place this man
under arrest.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.527
Joe: We'll never make it
over those mountains.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.562
Even if we do,

36:03.629 --> 36:05.096
The Marshal
will probably be waiting

36:05.231 --> 36:07.833
on the other side.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.435
Why do you do it, Joe?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.738
That is your name,
isn't it?

36:12.804 --> 36:13.839
Yeah.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.308
It is.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.744
A guy like you must
have it made in the Reich.

36:18.810 --> 36:22.281
Why risk it all for a film
you haven't even seen?

36:23.782 --> 36:26.252
Is it for him?

36:26.318 --> 36:28.254
For your dad?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.467
All right, what do we do?

36:43.269 --> 36:46.538
If I can get
the origami man's car,

36:46.605 --> 36:49.375
maybe I can draw
the bounty hunter
out of town.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.311
That way, we can
get you on the bus,
get you back home.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.879
- No, he'd catch you.
- No, he won't,

36:53.945 --> 36:55.481
not the way I drive.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.949
He doesn't even want you.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.518
I'm the one
who killed that man.

36:59.585 --> 37:02.288
Hey, I'm just as much
involved as you are.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.866
San Francisco is buzzing
with excitement this morning

37:14.933 --> 37:16.535
about the Crown
Prince's speech

37:16.602 --> 37:18.036
that will take place
later today

37:18.103 --> 37:19.671
at the Nazi Embassy.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.341
It's truly an historic event:

37:22.408 --> 37:24.376
the descendant
of the Sun Goddess,

37:24.443 --> 37:26.412
our glorious Crown Prince,

37:26.478 --> 37:27.813
addressing us in person--

37:27.879 --> 37:28.980
[knock on door]

37:29.047 --> 37:30.215
...in our own city,

37:30.316 --> 37:31.683
and from all indications,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.919
they're expecting
a record turnout.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.021
There are reports
that excited citizens

37:36.087 --> 37:38.089
are traveling
into San Francisco

37:38.156 --> 37:39.658
by the thousands...

37:44.696 --> 37:46.498
- Going somewhere?
- What are you talking about?

37:46.565 --> 37:49.501
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Give it to me, Frank.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.738
I am leaving, Ed, and you're
not going to stop me.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.139
Not till you
give me that gun.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.874
Oh, yeah? Or what?

38:01.647 --> 38:03.549
What the fuck
are you doing?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.851
We're going to sit right here,
just you and me,

38:05.917 --> 38:08.186
until the Crown Prince's
speech is over.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.221
Come on, Ed. You're
not going to shoot me.

38:10.356 --> 38:11.657
[click]

38:11.723 --> 38:14.259
Oh, no? You don't think
I would shoot you

38:14.360 --> 38:16.261
to keep you from killing
somebody else?

38:16.362 --> 38:17.963
From killing yourself?

38:18.029 --> 38:19.865
Because that's what
you'd be doing, Frank.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.433
Aah!

38:21.500 --> 38:23.369
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God damn it!

38:23.402 --> 38:25.504
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry!
I shot you.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.506
You wasted
one of my bullets.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.375
- You're bleeding.
- Oh, God.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.042
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.845
Just give me the first aid
kit out of the closet.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.555
Frank!

38:45.591 --> 38:47.092
What are you doing?

38:47.158 --> 38:49.160
[thumping]
Let me out!

38:49.227 --> 38:51.797
Don't do this, Frank!

38:51.863 --> 38:53.632
Oh, no.

38:53.699 --> 38:58.103
Frank, please! Don't!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.304
[thumping]

38:59.405 --> 39:01.006
Don't do this!

39:01.072 --> 39:02.508
Let me out!

39:02.574 --> 39:04.876
[thumping]
Frank!

39:08.814 --> 39:10.315
It's weird.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.684
You're white,

39:12.751 --> 39:15.086
which is a good thing,

39:15.153 --> 39:17.255
real good.

39:17.322 --> 39:20.158
But you're too white,

39:20.225 --> 39:23.161
which makes you a freak.

39:23.228 --> 39:27.966
It's like too much
of a good thing.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.440
You're done.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.615
[engine stalls]

39:51.189 --> 39:52.491
You're flooding it!

39:57.162 --> 39:58.730
Take your foot off the gas!

40:00.466 --> 40:02.067
[engine starts]

40:12.478 --> 40:14.546
Leave her the fuck alone.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.848
I'd be worried about
myself if I were you.

40:16.915 --> 40:20.085
Pull that trigger, and you'll
be killing a Nazi agent.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.553
What?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.421
I'm working that girl.
I need her alive.

40:23.489 --> 40:25.190
Why the fuck
should I believe that?

40:25.256 --> 40:28.126
Because I report directly
to ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith

40:28.193 --> 40:29.327
in New York.

40:29.394 --> 40:31.830
Why don't you give him a call?

40:31.897 --> 40:36.735
I'll do that once I'm
through talking to the girl.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.038
You stay out of my way
or I'll kill you.

41:01.359 --> 41:05.363
Gene Autry: * I'm back
in the saddle again *

41:05.430 --> 41:09.167
* Out where a friend
is a friend *

41:09.234 --> 41:11.903
* Where the longhorn
cattle feed *

41:11.970 --> 41:14.139
* On the lowly jimson weed *

41:14.205 --> 41:18.143
* Back in the saddle again *

41:18.209 --> 41:22.814
* Ridin' the range
once more *

41:22.881 --> 41:26.251
* Totin' my old .44 *

41:26.317 --> 41:28.920
* Where you sleep out
every night *

41:28.987 --> 41:31.056
* And the only law is right *

41:31.122 --> 41:34.760
* Back in the saddle again *

41:44.570 --> 41:46.572
[panting]

42:00.051 --> 42:04.590
* Back in the saddle again *

42:37.689 --> 42:39.958
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:41.159 --> 42:42.628
I'd better get you home.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.936
[security radio chatter]

43:29.941 --> 43:32.377
[chatter in Japanese]

44:04.342 --> 44:06.945
Yes, sir. Passport.

44:24.262 --> 44:26.197
That bus should be
here any minute.

44:26.264 --> 44:27.966
Yeah.

44:28.033 --> 44:30.035
I'm not getting on it.

44:30.101 --> 44:32.203
[sigh] I can't go back
without answers.

44:32.270 --> 44:34.740
Juliana, the bounty hunter
could come back at any second.

44:34.773 --> 44:35.941
I know.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.109
Look, I got to make
a phone call.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.112
Juliana.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.749
I'm going to check
and make sure

44:43.815 --> 44:46.117
we didn't leave
any evidence behind.

44:53.291 --> 44:55.326
Gentlemen,
I have been informed

44:55.393 --> 44:57.095
that the Crown Prince
and Princess

44:57.162 --> 44:59.164
will be arriving shortly.
Please take your seats.

45:08.639 --> 45:11.509
Ah, Mr. Shimura.

45:11.576 --> 45:14.112
A man of your stature should
not be so far in the back.

45:14.179 --> 45:16.782
Thank you, OberfÃ¼hrer.
I am quite content.

45:16.848 --> 45:20.018
I won't hear of it.
Come. Please come.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.924
Here. Right here. Sit.

45:31.029 --> 45:32.998
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.433
Thanks.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.467
I'm sorry.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.107
[speaking Japanese]

46:24.549 --> 46:26.051
[applause]

46:28.053 --> 46:31.389

47:00.919 --> 47:02.720
[ring]

47:02.888 --> 47:04.555
Hello.

47:04.622 --> 47:06.257
Ed?

47:06.324 --> 47:07.625
Is that you?

47:07.692 --> 47:09.294
Jules.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.929
Listen, you got
to get back here.

47:10.996 --> 47:14.900
Frank's about to do
something terrible.

47:14.966 --> 47:17.335
Hurry, you've got to stop him.
Please.

47:17.402 --> 47:19.070
What do you mean?

47:20.538 --> 47:22.573
[police radio chatter]

47:43.161 --> 47:45.596
[Crown Prince
speaking Japanese]

47:48.166 --> 47:50.301
Translator:
Greetings, loyal subjects.

47:50.368 --> 47:53.004
Honored guests
from the Nazi Reich.

47:53.071 --> 47:55.640
[speaking Japanese]

47:55.706 --> 47:59.044
And people of the
American Territories,

47:59.110 --> 48:02.113
or, as they like
to say here--

48:03.448 --> 48:04.950
Howdy.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.451
[laughter]

48:09.020 --> 48:10.956

48:15.526 --> 48:18.563
Translator: All those
who fought in the Great War

48:18.629 --> 48:22.367
believed they fought on
the side of righteousness,

48:22.433 --> 48:27.705
that the world they sought to
build would be a better one.

48:27.772 --> 48:29.340
[speaking Japanese]

48:34.980 --> 48:38.883
But men are mortal
and imperfect.

48:38.984 --> 48:42.287
They see the world
as they wish to see it,

48:42.353 --> 48:46.391
through the looking glass
of their limited perspective.

48:47.825 --> 48:50.295
