a message from Mr Springer

claiming he'd discovered
new evidence on an old case.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.640
Selwyn, just get back to me.
Will you?

04:23.720 --> 04:24.760
So who's Jasmine?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.400
Billy's wife.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.920
She was murdered 30 years ago.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.720
We never caught
the person that did it.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.640
But, if he'd arranged
to meet the commissioner

04:33.720 --> 04:36.960
to talk about his wife's murder,
why would he kill himself?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.600
Exactly the question
we've been asking.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.560
And the only answer
we've come up with is...

04:40.640 --> 04:42.360
-He wouldn't.
-So it was murder.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.920
Staged to look like a suicide.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.840
SELWYN:
And we can only assume
that whoever killed Jasmine,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.520
has now also killed Billy.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.760
Because he'd found the evidence
of the original murder?

04:52.840 --> 04:55.480
But I thought you said the door
was locked on the inside?

04:55.880 --> 04:56.960
It was.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.720
There are no other
doors or windows.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.200
So that's the
only way in or out.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.720
So how did the killer do it?

05:01.800 --> 05:04.040
Well, there's the rub, Florence.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.720
you've got to go past the entry.

have seen something.

could you update Dwayne and JP?

this dressing room

of that note that poor Billy
was talking about.

hasn't already taken it.

who came and went to the
dressing rooms after the concert

05:48.080 --> 05:50.600
were the band themselves,
and Kai.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.160
That means one of these four
has to be Billy's killer.

Except, if this is
connected to Jasmine's murder,

05:56.360 --> 05:59.800

Kai was just a baby then.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.040
The one thing we can be sure of,
he didn't kill his mother.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.800
Well, we need to speak to them.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.400
Now, I wonder if you could
start by telling us, how was he?

06:10.480 --> 06:11.920
Billy, over the last few days.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.520
We've been rehearsing
for a couple of weeks.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.440
And he seemed
to be enjoying himself.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.480
-Wouldn't you say?
-That's not quite true.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.200
This morning, I went to Dad's

06:23.280 --> 06:24.960
and something had
changed in him.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
In what way?

06:27.560 --> 06:29.480
He was distracted.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.960
Not himself, like something
was bothering him.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.640
He spent the morning
fixing the pick guard
on his guitar.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.160
He said he had nerves
about playing again, but...

06:37.240 --> 06:38.840
And you're not sure
that's what it was.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.080
And were you aware
of your father owning a gun?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.080
Did any of you know about it?

06:50.840 --> 06:53.960
So, after finishing
the performance this afternoon,

06:54.040 --> 06:56.360
which, by the way,
was excellent,

06:56.440 --> 06:59.360
could you just talk me
through exactly what happened?

06:59.440 --> 07:01.840
Well, we played the encore,

07:01.920 --> 07:03.640
then we come off the stage

07:03.720 --> 07:06.000
and then we headed
back to the dressing room.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.880
I jumped in the shower,
got changed,

07:08.960 --> 07:11.880
and when I knocked
on Billy's door to go
to the after show party,

07:11.960 --> 07:13.400
there was no answer.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.400
Then Delmar, him

07:15.480 --> 07:16.880
knock on our doors,

07:16.960 --> 07:18.760
so that he could see
that Billy wasn't there.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.800
-What?
-You see Billy?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.560
And Kai,
where were you during this?

07:24.640 --> 07:26.600
I was out here
getting us a drink, and...

07:26.680 --> 07:28.360
-Everything all right?
-You see Billy?

07:28.440 --> 07:29.680
I was just with him.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.400
And between seeing him alive
and finding him dead,

07:33.200 --> 07:34.600
none of you heard a gunshot?

07:34.680 --> 07:37.240
I've always got music
playing after a gig.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.280
Mind you it was
pretty loud, so...

07:40.360 --> 07:42.880
Tell me about it.
That's all I could
hear blasting away.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.200
Hmm.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.400
And tell me,
did Billy mention Jasmine at all

07:48.480 --> 07:50.040
at any point over
the last few days?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.840
Not that I remember.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.160
My mum was playing on his mind

07:55.240 --> 07:57.280
since the band
started rehearsing.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.280
I knew it'd brought
some memories back up.

08:05.840 --> 08:09.120
Billy called me this afternoon
and left a message.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.880
He said he'd discovered
a new piece of evidence

08:11.960 --> 08:14.320
that pointed to
Jasmine's murderer.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.640
And we believe it to be
one of the members of this band.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.880
What di...

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
(CHUCKLING)

08:19.040 --> 08:20.520
Wait, this is a joke, right?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.520
No. No joke.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.240
I'm sure you'll
all agree it's strange.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.120
Billy chose to take his own life
just a couple of hours

08:28.200 --> 08:29.520
after making that call.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.920
He wouldn't.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.720
Not when he found out something
about who killed mum.

08:33.800 --> 08:37.080
You really think
that Billy was murdered?

08:38.680 --> 08:41.600
And you think it was
one of us three who did it?

08:41.680 --> 08:43.320
At this moment in time,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.120
it's hard to draw
any other conclusion.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.680
Oh, and just
one last thing before we go.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.640
There was a rusty old fork

08:53.720 --> 08:55.640
in Mr Springer's dressing room.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.680
Any idea what it was
doing there?

08:57.760 --> 08:59.520
It was Dad's.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.800
He lost a guitar capo
once before.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.080
Sorry. Guitar capo?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.600
It's a device where
you clamp onto the strings,

09:06.680 --> 09:07.880
to shorten the length.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.160
So it can make a different key.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.760
And your father
used a fork instead?

09:14.840 --> 09:17.040
Yes, and an elastic band

09:17.120 --> 09:18.840
to put it all in place.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.600
I mean, you could use a pen,
pencil, cigarette lighter.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.640
But all Dad could find
before the gig was a fork.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.840
Us musicians,
we love to improvise, Inspector.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.120
Mmm. So what
was it doing on the floor?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.040
Had he been using it today?

09:34.120 --> 09:36.960
I'm sorry, inspector,
but does this have anything
to do with Billy's murder?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.840
No, Ms Oprey.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.200
It certainly does not.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.160
(SIGHS)

09:44.240 --> 09:47.440
JACK: Sir, were you involved
in the original Jasmine Springer
investigation?

09:48.720 --> 09:51.360
It was my first serious case
as a detective.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.480
I see.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.320
And do you think you could
bring us up to speed,
at some point?

09:57.400 --> 09:58.600
If you've got time.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.600
Of course. First thing tomorrow.

They sit heavily, don't they?
Over the years.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.520
The ones that don't get solved.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.640
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.200
Sir, we've searched the suspects
and the dressing rooms,

10:18.280 --> 10:20.840
and no sign of the note
Billy Springer talked about.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.920
Really?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.160
So where is it?

10:23.240 --> 10:24.680
The killer must have
got rid of it.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.640
If it was paper,
it wouldn't be hard to destroy.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.320
So the one piece
of evidence we have

10:29.400 --> 10:33.240
that could finally solve
a 30-year-old murder case
no longer exists.

murdered Jasmine Springer.

And then, 30 years later,
killed her husband Billy.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.800
We just need to work out who.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.880
And how.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.960
Just how did they manage
to make it look like,
in every discernible way,

10:51.040 --> 10:52.440
Billy locked himself
in his dressing room

10:52.520 --> 10:53.760
and then shot himself.

(SIGHS)

10:59.120 --> 11:00.920
Florence.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.320
There appears to be
a little old man
asleep on our bench.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.440
Mmm-hmm, I can see that, sir.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.880
-Should we wake him?
-Yeah.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.280
Maybe give him a quick prod.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.360
Excuse me, sir?

11:12.440 --> 11:13.440
(GROANS)

11:14.320 --> 11:15.440
Ah.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.840
What you doing here?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.200
Oh, you're Nelson.
You're his Dad.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.920
Don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.440
DI Jack Mooney, it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.120
This is DS Florence Cassell.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
Enchante.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.160
What do you want?

11:34.240 --> 11:37.640
Is that any way for a son
to speak to his father?
I ask you.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.000
We should probably go inside,
crack on.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.880
NELSON: So you don't want
to listen to my story.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.680
Come all the way here
to talk to you.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.400
I thought Dwayne said
his dad had gone.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.960
Well, Dwayne told him to go.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.880
But his father said
he won't disappear until
they make peace.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.440
Oh, and... And JP,
could you get the gun and the
dressing room key to the lab,

12:01.520 --> 12:02.760
and have a check for prints?

12:02.840 --> 12:04.520
-I will do, sir.
-Yeah.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.080
And, Florence, in the morning,
would you see about digging out

12:07.160 --> 12:10.280
the original Jasmine Springer
case file from the archives?

12:10.360 --> 12:13.720
Oh, look at the time.
We can pick this up again
in the morning.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.760
Yeah, I could do with
nipping down to the
harbour market before it closes.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.280
Bye. See you later.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.520
JACK: I'm going to ask
to keep this shirt.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.000
Got no choice...

12:24.560 --> 12:26.480
So do you want to talk about it?

12:26.560 --> 12:28.720
No.
There's nothing to talk about.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.480
In a day or so, he's going
to disappear again
like he always does.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.640
And in about a week,
it'll be like he was
never even here.

12:35.720 --> 12:40.120
But, in the meantime,
we've got a very important
investigation to solve.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.520
So I'm going to need you
focused and on your case. Okay?

12:44.480 --> 12:45.640
Yes, Dwayne.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.040
Good.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.320
I'll see you in the morning.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.080
If it's Ragers' stuff
you're after,

13:01.160 --> 13:03.320
you're better going
with their first two albums.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.120
Nelson!

13:05.200 --> 13:07.440
You know, their earlier material
was the real deal.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.120
-Proper roots reggae.
-Yeah?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.600
It had something to say,
you know.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.360
Yeah, well, I just want
to get a flavour, that's all.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.840
My boat's over there. I got some
beers chilling in the fridge.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.240
We could shoot the breeze.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.480
You could tell me
how Dwayne's been doing.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.760
Oh, well, er,
I'd love that, Nelson,

13:22.840 --> 13:25.600
but I gotta get
some work done on the case.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.520
Yeah.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.320
But, my shack is just
around the bay, so if you're
passing and fancy a cuppa,

13:31.400 --> 13:32.960
feel free to pop in.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.720
Might take you up on that.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.960
Night, then.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.080
(KETTLE WHISTLING)

13:50.160 --> 13:51.640
What in the name of?

13:51.720 --> 13:53.760

13:53.840 --> 13:56.360
-Cup of tea, do you?
-(LAUGHING) Nelson, what...

13:56.440 --> 13:58.360
So I woke up this morning,

13:58.440 --> 14:00.560
realised I was out of milk.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.840
Then I remembered
your kind offer.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.240
-And here you are!
-(LAUGHING) Yeah.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.600
Quite a spot
you've got yourself here.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.360
Hmm?

14:09.440 --> 14:12.200
I think it'd suit me
down to the ground.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.680
Sorry, suit you down to the...

14:18.320 --> 14:19.280
Oh.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.160
Heh.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.720
Morning, everyone.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.760
Ah, what a beautiful day,
eh, Chief?

14:29.840 --> 14:31.720
Ah, yes, Dwayne. Isn't it just?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.320
Er, everything all right, Chief?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.120
Yeah, yeah, everything's grand.
Couldn't be better.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.560
Oh, good, it's the commissioner.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.640
-Morning, sir.
-Inspector.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.160
(SIGHS) You're just in time.
We're about to make a start
going over everything.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.680
Florence, did you manage to dig
out the Jasmine Springer file?

14:48.760 --> 14:50.480
Yes, sir. It's over there.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.320
Oh, and perhaps
you'd like to reacquaint
yourself with everything, sir?

14:54.440 --> 14:55.520
Good.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.080
Now, the shooting
of Billy Springer.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.360
Now, we believe
that Billy's killer is one of
our three bandmates.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.880
Delmar Brown,

15:07.560 --> 15:08.960
Maya Oprey

15:09.640 --> 15:11.320
and Leon Laroche.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.040
Whoever it was,
we already know the motive
for killing him, don't we?

15:14.120 --> 15:15.200
-I...
-Yes, Dwayne.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.560
It was to stop him
from revealing

15:16.640 --> 15:18.920
that they murdered
Jasmine Springer 30 years ago.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.560
Correct.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.880
Now, if we're to work out
who killed Billy Springer
in the present,

15:22.960 --> 15:26.840
we need to open up a cold case
from 30 years ago.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.920
And work out who killed
Jasmine Springer in the past.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.040
Commissioner, perhaps
you'd like to fill us in
on the original case.

15:43.840 --> 15:48.760
On the 3rd of June, 1988,
officers were called
to Siren's Point

15:48.840 --> 15:50.480
at the north end of the island.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.440
Jasmine Springer's body
had been discovered
by a dog walker.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.440
Having recently been promoted
to Detective Constable,

15:58.520 --> 16:00.480
I attended the scene.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.720
The post-mortem confirmed
that she'd been strangled
with her own neck scarf.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.760
There'd been a spate of
violent muggings at the time.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.560
And, as her jewellery
had been taken,

16:09.640 --> 16:13.600
and her handbag
emptied of any valuables,
we assumed her death

16:13.680 --> 16:16.720
to be at the hands
of our unidentified mugger.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.160
And whoever killed her,

16:19.240 --> 16:21.840
dumped her body
at Siren's Point.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.720
In light of yesterday's murder,

16:24.360 --> 16:26.680
it does now appear,

16:26.760 --> 16:29.880
that we may have got
the original investigation
somewhat...

16:31.320 --> 16:32.480
Wrong.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.960
So three suspects. Who did it?
Was it Delmar Brown?

16:40.040 --> 16:43.760
Mr Brown is 53-years-old.
He's the band's drummer.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.680
He currently works
as a general manager

16:45.760 --> 16:48.320
over at Johnson's bar,
just outside of town.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.640
And that place attracts
a very questionable clientele.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.760
Yes. That's right, sir.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.160
And Delmar's got
a few charges on file.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.800
But, nothing too major.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.880
Right. Who's next?
This fellow, Leon Laroche.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.920
JP: Okay, The Ragers' front man.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.720
Somewhat of a local celebrity.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.880
He earns a living now singing
at hotels and on cruise ships.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.160
Firmly bitten by
the showbiz bug, eh?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.040
And what about Maya Oprey?

17:15.120 --> 17:19.200
Er, forty-nine-years-old.
She runs her own business,
a real estate company.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.000
From what I can tell,
she's the only one
who's made a success of her life

17:22.080 --> 17:23.320
after the band split.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.000
Mmm-hmm. Fair play to her.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.320
(SIGHS WEARILY)

17:26.400 --> 17:30.280
Our victim, Billy Springer.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.880
Dwayne, you're the biggest
Ragers' fan here,
possibly anywhere.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.720
Well, he's the lead guitarist
and the songwriting talent
of the band.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.680
It took a few years for them
to get their sound,

17:37.760 --> 17:40.960
but by their early twenties,
they were a big thing
on the island.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.640
And what about the split?

17:42.720 --> 17:44.520
Happened shortly
after Jasmine's murder, yeah?

17:44.600 --> 17:47.880
Right, but things had been
shaky in the band
well before that.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.640
Oh?

17:49.720 --> 17:51.760
You see, in the summer of 1988,
they'd planned
this big European tour

17:51.840 --> 17:53.440
to raise their profile.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.680
But Jasmine put a halt to it
halfway through.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.000
-Do we know why?
-No.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.480
Billy had always had, erm,
addiction issues.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.560
All the pressures
and stresses of touring

18:03.640 --> 18:06.800
had caused him to start
drinking and using drugs again.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.720
So, when they got
back into the studio,

18:08.800 --> 18:12.720
there was still a lot
of that resentment and tensions.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.840
Well, we should look into
these tensions.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.520
And how deep they ran.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.120
Isn't going to be easy,
given the murder happened
30 years ago.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.560
I can dig out
our suspect's financial and
phone records from the time.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.800
Great.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.960
And we should
work through press coverage

18:26.040 --> 18:27.960
of the band back in the day.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.280
Er, and Dwayne and JP, could
you go over to Billy's house,
give it the once over?

18:31.360 --> 18:32.800
Yes, Chief.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.160
Do your thing. Hmm.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.120
Commissioner,
would I be right in thinking

18:38.200 --> 18:40.720
that you'll want
to stay involved with this one?

18:40.800 --> 18:42.840
And why would you
think that, Inspector?

18:42.920 --> 18:44.800
Well, just with
your connection to it...

18:44.880 --> 18:47.960
The last thing I want
is to get in the way.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.520
You know where I am,
if you need me.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.720
(EXHALES)

18:57.760 --> 18:59.360
Wow!

18:59.440 --> 19:03.560
If you would have told me
I would be visiting
Billy Springer's house,

19:03.640 --> 19:05.680
I never would
have believed it, you know, JP.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.960
I just wish it was
under different circumstances.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.840
But there's no time
for wallowing, JP.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.760
I wasn't. You were.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.760
Listen, you take upstairs.
I'll look downstairs.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.880
And no shirking
while you're at it.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.400
When do I ever shirk?

19:33.280 --> 19:36.480
Florence, there's a string
missing on Billy's guitar.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.440
The top one, the E string,
if memory serves me correctly.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.560
It must've broken
when he was playing.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.720
That can happen, can't it?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.120
Yeah, it's not uncommon.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.800
Just, I don't remember
seeing it happen.

Sir, I think you might be right.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.080
What, you didn't
notice it break either?

19:51.160 --> 19:53.880
No, sir, about Jasmine
calling a halt to the tour.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.800
Like, it had
quite a financial impact.

19:55.880 --> 19:56.920
Oh.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.840
According to the
checks I've run,

19:58.920 --> 20:00.760
there was nothing
suspicious going on

20:00.840 --> 20:03.440
in Leon's or Maya's
bank accounts at that time.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.760
But, the drummer, Delmar Brown,
lost a lot of money.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.320
Looks like he
bankrolled the tour.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.360
So when it was cancelled,
he lost over $50,000.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.360
Not a small amount
back in the '80s.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.080
Or today, for that matter.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.400
Certainly enough to leave him
hacked off with Jasmine.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.600

as you'd expect,
only partial prints

20:29.440 --> 20:32.480
found on the dressing room key,
not identifiable.

20:32.560 --> 20:37.560
And striation marks
on the bullet match those of
the gun found in Billy's hand.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.080
Any prints found on the gun?

20:39.880 --> 20:41.240
Two sets.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.000
Billy Springer's and well, well,
well, would you believe it?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.680
Looks like we've now
got two reasons
to talk to Delmar.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.120
Yup.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.240
Why do you own a gun, Mr Brown?

20:52.440 --> 20:53.880
For protection, you know?

20:53.960 --> 20:56.840
There are some bad sorts
that come into this place.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.880
The kind of people that you
do not want to be
owing money to.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.040
I take the gun
with me most places,

21:03.120 --> 21:04.320
just in case.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.320
Who in the band knew you had it?

21:08.680 --> 21:11.280
We were rehearsing hard, 24/7.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.880
Maybe one of them
saw it in my bag.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.920
Tell me, Delmar.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.840
Back in '85,
the band went on tour to Europe,

21:20.920 --> 21:22.480
but it was cut short.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.280
Now, you lost a lot of money,
didn't you?

21:24.360 --> 21:25.480
Mmm-hmm.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.200
Just over 50,000.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.480
Yeah. My granny left it to me.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.920
It was supposed to pay for me
to go to law school in America.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.240
But, instead,

21:37.320 --> 21:39.920
I chose to invest it
in the band's future.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.600
Not the best decision
you ever made.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.800
My family kept on telling me
to have a back-up plan.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.280
-But you ignored them.
-And, you know,
it would've paid off.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.160
Those first few gigs in Europe,

21:50.240 --> 21:53.520
man, we were getting
some serious attention.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.720
Right up until
Jasmine Springer interfered.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.240
You must've really resented her.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.760
Listen.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.920
Every single thing
that is wrong in my life now

22:08.800 --> 22:10.200
is down to that woman.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.880
Everything.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.000
But it does not mean
that I killed her.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.920
Hello? Mmm-hmm. Sure.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.280
We're on our way.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.320
Dwayne.
They've got something for us
over at the victim's house.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.600
Oh, good stuff.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.280
Well, Chief,
we really didn't find much
connecting to either Jasmine's

22:37.360 --> 22:39.120
or Billy's time with the band.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.640
However, JP was
searching Billy's bedroom

22:41.720 --> 22:43.960
when he came across
something of importance.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.280
Would you like to
update the chief, JP?

22:46.360 --> 22:47.560
Er, yes.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.600
So, these photo albums
are from Billy's bedroom.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.760
There was a chest of drawers
stuffed full of them.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.880
All mainly of Kai
as he was growing up.

22:57.520 --> 23:01.800
These three are
from between 1990 and 1993.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.280
'92. That would be
a couple of years after
Jasmine was murdered.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.000
It's Maya.

23:07.080 --> 23:10.080
She features a lot,
and when I say a lot,
I mean a heck of a lot.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.640
Hmm? There, there. Mmm-hmm.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.600
Er, Dwayne, would you
like to do the talking?

23:17.640 --> 23:19.720
(SIGHS) If I must.

23:19.800 --> 23:25.000
As you can see, Chief,
they had many days out,
and holidays.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.120
She used to spend
a lot of time here at the house.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.320
You know, everyday things like,
cooking, TV...

23:31.400 --> 23:33.200
Maya was always there.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.680
There, there, there.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.320
And then after two years,
she stops appearing.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.800
So what are you saying?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.920
There's more to Billy and Maya's
relationship than she let on?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.400
We think it's possible, sir.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.360
If you didn't know any better,
looking at these photos,

23:45.440 --> 23:47.680
you'd be convinced Maya
was a part of the family.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.400
Let's get a hold of Kai,
see if he can shed
any more light on this.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.600
Yes, Chief. Hmm.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.160
Hey, JP.
Is everything okay with Dwayne?

23:57.240 --> 23:58.840
I don't know, sir.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.200
I think his dad being around

24:01.280 --> 24:03.600
is bothering him
more than he'd like to admit.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.200
(SIGHS)

24:07.280 --> 24:10.160
After Mum's death,
Dad really lost it.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.320
He got back on the booze, drugs.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.080
You were just
a few months old then.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.960
My auntie took me in.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.240
Dad wasn't really up for
raising a kid.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.880
So what happened?

24:20.960 --> 24:24.280
Various people
tried to intervene.
He just shut everybody out.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.240
Until Maya stepped in.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.880
Somehow she managed
to get through to him.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.000
He got clean?

24:31.080 --> 24:33.960
He went to rehab,
the full works.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.640
And when I was about two,
he took me back in

24:36.720 --> 24:38.000
and started being a dad again.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.520
And he never looked back.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.200
So, ah,

24:42.600 --> 24:46.480
Maya stuck around after
your dad sorted himself out.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.000
She was really there for him.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.200
Helped him learn
to live without my mum.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.760
After a couple of years,
Maya stops appearing
in the photos.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.600
Why?

24:57.680 --> 25:02.160
I was about five, and one night,
there was a massive argument.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.480
Never heard Dad so angry.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.520
And then the next day, she gone.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.040
Did you ever find out
what happened?

25:10.120 --> 25:12.680
What she wanted
was more than friendship.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.920
She was in love with Dad.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.880
That night they argued.
She suggested they get married.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.520
But Billy didn't feel the same.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.440
(SIGHS) He said he could
never love anybody else.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.200
He felt angry at Maya
for even thinking that he could.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.520
You don't think
this has something to do
with my mum's murder?

25:32.480 --> 25:33.960
MAYA:
And we're west facing here,

25:34.040 --> 25:36.680
so the view at sunset
is pretty special.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.760
Why don't you go and take
a look around without me?

25:38.840 --> 25:40.280
-Thank you.
-(LAUGHS)

25:40.360 --> 25:42.080
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

25:42.160 --> 25:44.560
I'm with clients here,
so if you could keep this brief?

25:44.640 --> 25:46.520
We'll try our very best, Maya.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.680
Shall we?

25:50.280 --> 25:53.160
I must say, I'm very impressed.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.360
You've really made something of
yourself since the band split.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.720
I had no choice.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.760
As my father always said,
don't waste time

26:01.840 --> 26:03.600
clinging to dreams
that never come true.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.560
(SIGHS) Sounds like a wise man.
Yeah.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.520
Tell me, Maya,
would you say the same applies

26:08.600 --> 26:10.640
when it comes to
affairs of the heart?

26:10.720 --> 26:12.440
Sorry? You lost me.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.240
You were in love with Billy,
weren't you?

26:14.320 --> 26:15.720
FLORENCE: We know you were.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.720
A few years after Jasmine died,
you told him so.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.080
That's right, isn't it?

26:21.040 --> 26:22.640
At first, he was fine.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.160
Billy was young,
playing the field,

26:24.240 --> 26:25.880
I thought when it'd
come to settling down,

26:25.960 --> 26:28.120
finding the right girl
that mattered, it'd be me.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.800
But then Jasmine came along.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.480
I was convinced
it wouldn't last.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.080
But, on it went, they got
engaged, married, had a son.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.520
And all the time, I sat there
on the sideline telling myself,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.040
"Any minute now, he'd realise
he chose the wrong girl."

26:46.040 --> 26:48.040
I can see where you're
going with this, Inspector.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.320
And where is that, Maya?

26:50.800 --> 26:53.320
You're wondering
if I killed Jasmine Springer

26:53.400 --> 26:55.080
so I could have Billy
all to myself.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.240
I may have resented Jasmine,

27:02.240 --> 27:04.960
but I could never
have harmed her.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.000
'Cause I know that
would have hurt Billy,
and that I could never do.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.960
Now, if you'll excuse me.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.840
What's that saying?

27:19.920 --> 27:24.080
"The love that lasts the longest
is the love that's
never returned."

27:24.160 --> 27:25.680
It's very true, sir,

27:25.760 --> 27:27.000
but very sad.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.240
(EXHALES)

27:53.840 --> 27:55.640
Oh, for the love of...

28:01.440 --> 28:03.000
(GUITAR STRUMMING)

28:04.920 --> 28:06.880
Ah, Jack boy.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.160
Good day at the office?

28:08.240 --> 28:10.360
So you're...
You're sleeping here now.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.000
It saves me going
back and forth to the boat.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.840
-You don't mind, do you?
-Erm...

28:14.920 --> 28:18.400
And in return,
I'm cooking us dinner.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.120
A proper Caribbean feast.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.200
Oh, right.
That's very kind of you,
Nelson. Thank you.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.240
So why don't we crack this open?

28:25.320 --> 28:28.360
And have ourselves a
little preprandial rum.
What do you say?

28:28.440 --> 28:30.480
Well, I was going
to do a bit of work.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.600
I suppose a little one might
warm up the brain cells a bit.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.200
I'll fetch the glasses.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.400
(SIGHS)

28:36.480 --> 28:39.080
Anybody fancy
a beer at Catherine's? Dwayne?

28:39.160 --> 28:42.200
Er, erm,
I certainly wouldn't say no.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.080
-Sarge?
-No, you go ahead.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.320
What, you find something?

28:45.400 --> 28:47.560
It's a lease document
belonging to the victim

28:47.640 --> 28:50.120
for a property down
by Sandy Bay.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.560
Kai never mentioned that to us?

28:51.640 --> 28:53.720
From what I can tell,
Billy took the lease out

28:53.800 --> 28:55.720
a couple of years
after Jasmine's death.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.000
I should go take a look.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.400
You want us to come with you?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.960
It's fine. You get off.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.440
Okay.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.080
Hello?

29:20.880 --> 29:22.240
Is anyone in here?

29:55.640 --> 29:56.840
Jasmine.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.400
(DOOR CLOSES)

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Who's there?

30:16.920 --> 30:18.160
No, no, no, no, no.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.080
Reggae's all about the downbeat.

30:21.160 --> 30:25.320
Yeah, calypso is the upbeat,
you know...

30:27.040 --> 30:29.600
I might have to admit defeat
on this, Nelson.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.440
To be honest, music's more of
a spectator sport for me.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.200
That's what they call the chop,

30:36.040 --> 30:37.920
or the strike.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.840
Or my favourite,
the chiki-chiki.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.600
Chiki-chiki. I like it.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.480
It's the hit on the offbeat

30:43.560 --> 30:46.680
that's at the heart of every
reggae song written.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.240
That's brilliant, Nelson.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.400
Did you never think
of making a go at this?

31:08.480 --> 31:11.400
Oh, I tried, man. I tried.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.520
It's what took me to London.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.400
But it never really
happened for me.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.680
Why did you never come back?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.800
Pride.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.920
You know, I left here,
saying I'll make something
of myself, and, er...

31:26.000 --> 31:27.760
Then I didn't.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.480
I guess I didn't want my family
at home to know
that I had failed them.

31:31.560 --> 31:35.080
You see, when they're thousands
of miles away,

31:35.160 --> 31:37.600
you never think
you're hurting anyone.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.720
Then I saw Dwayne in London.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.640
He had such anger in his eyes.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.280
Such bitterness.

No, just...

31:55.840 --> 31:59.200

you had company.

snuck off early, huh?

So, who is it?
Who is the lucky lady, huh?

There's no lucky lady, Dwayne.

invited me to stay.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.640
Well, no,
that's not quite how...

33:13.720 --> 33:16.040
We've been having quite a high
old time of it, haven't we?

33:16.120 --> 33:17.320
I wouldn't go that far, Nelson.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.200
We better get going,
you know, Chief.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.720
We've got a lot of work to do.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.160
Maybe see you later, Dwayne.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.840
(SIGHS)

33:30.560 --> 33:31.760
DWAYNE: Thanks a lot, Chief.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.680
Dwayne, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Nelson,

33:33.760 --> 33:35.320
but it's not how he says it was.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.360
The man just sort of
invited himself here.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.520
Well, that's him.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.480
Give the man an inch
and he'll take a mile.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.000
Now, I wouldn't want you
to think I'm taking his side
in any of this.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.480
The man is a leech. He's forced
his way into your life

33:45.560 --> 33:47.520
the way he's trying to force
his way back into mine.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.160
Oh, but it won't be for long.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.120
Give it a couple of days.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.800
He'll be gone before
you know it.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.920
Are you sure about this?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.760
Because from what
he was saying last night,

33:56.840 --> 33:58.800
I think he wants to stay,
make it up to you.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.760
Okay, we'll see.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.240
Give it a day or two,

34:02.320 --> 34:04.920
-and he'll be out
of both of our hair.
-(ENGINE STARTS)

34:05.000 --> 34:07.440
This place is full
of Jasmine's stuff.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.480
Clothes, books, jewellery.
Everything that belonged to her.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.640
So Billy held on to it all?
Fair play to him.

34:12.720 --> 34:13.880
And this is where he put it.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.400
Yes, it's a...

34:15.480 --> 34:18.600
There's also his things from
his time with the band as well.

34:18.680 --> 34:20.840
We've been going through it all
since first light.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.960
Good.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.200
You should also know, sir,

34:23.280 --> 34:25.360
that someone had
already broken in here,

34:25.440 --> 34:26.680
gone through the boxes.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.120
What were they looking for?

34:28.200 --> 34:30.800
Probably the evidence Billy told
the commissioner he'd found.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.160
You mean the note?

34:32.240 --> 34:34.200
So Billy didn't take it with him
to the concert?

34:34.280 --> 34:37.920
Question is,
did whoever was here find it?

34:39.640 --> 34:41.240
Well, what have we got?

34:41.320 --> 34:44.000
Well, sir, there's nothing here
that might point to a motive

34:44.080 --> 34:46.000
or a suspect
for Jasmine's murder.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.240
But we did find these
amongst Billy's stuff.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.680
It's to do with the band.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.040
All the session tapes from
the Ragers' studio recordings.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.560
Yeah, these here, from the
last session before they split.

34:54.640 --> 34:57.080
They were recorded the same day
Jasmine was murdered.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.520
June 5th, 1988.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.080
Won't that just be the songs
they were recording that day?

35:02.160 --> 35:04.360
Er, more than likely,

35:04.440 --> 35:06.000
but we wondered
if maybe between takes

35:06.080 --> 35:08.320
there might have been something
that was said,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.880
you know, like how things were
between the band.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.760
Oh, and do you know anywhere
we might be able to play these?

35:13.840 --> 35:16.040
Er, we could try
the Sunshine Recording Studio.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.920
That's where the Ragers
made all their albums.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.040
Right, well, why don't
you fellas head over there,

35:20.120 --> 35:22.120
listen to what's on them.
Definitely worth a try.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.240
Okay.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.280
Yeah.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.400
I do hope, Inspector,

35:40.480 --> 35:43.320
considering that we have
a double murder on our hands,

35:43.400 --> 35:46.520
that that fork hasn't become
the sole focus
of your attention.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.640
Absolutely not, sir.
Of course, not.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.280
I... (SIGHS)

35:50.360 --> 35:51.920
-I was just...
-I came for an update,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.440
on how the investigation
was progressing.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.760
JACK: Well, sir...

35:56.840 --> 36:00.360
I have to admit,
the Jasmine Springer murder

36:00.440 --> 36:02.680
is proving slow-going
at the moment.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.080
And the Billy Springer case?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.680
Equally slow-going,
to be brutally honest.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.640
-They're both really quite...
-Slow-going?

36:08.720 --> 36:10.280
Well, that's about
the size of it, sir.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.520
Sorry.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.000
Chief, check your email.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.640
You should have a sound file
emailed over to you
from the studio.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.960
-What is it?
-It's a conversation
caught on tape

36:19.040 --> 36:20.800
during the break
at a recording session.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.840
Now, most of the band
and sound engineers

36:22.920 --> 36:24.080
had gone to get a coffee,

36:24.160 --> 36:26.880
but they left
the reel still turning.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.440
So who is it heard talking?

36:28.520 --> 36:32.160
-Jasmine Springer.
-And Leon Laroche.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.560
JASMINE ON RECORDING:
I'm sorry but Billy
need to know.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.920
LEON ON RECORDING:
Please, Jasmine,
don't tell him.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.880
JASMINE: I can't keep
lying to him.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.960
LEON: But he can't know
what we've done.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.560
They were having an affair.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.640
I'd say so, Chief.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.760
And a few hours
after telling Leon

36:46.840 --> 36:50.080
she was going
to reveal it to Billy,
Jasmine turns up dead.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.040
Meaning, Billy never finds out.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.960
Would you care to tag along
on this one, sir?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.880
LEON: One, two. One, two.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.240
Mic check, mic check.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.360
One, two. One, two.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.280
Afternoon.

37:07.520 --> 37:11.560
Not exactly Wembley Arena,
is it, Mr Laroche?

37:11.640 --> 37:12.800
Well, you know,

37:13.960 --> 37:16.160
I go to where
the music takes me.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.640
And it's brought
you all the way to

37:17.720 --> 37:20.520
"Claire and Barry Thompson's
Silver Wedding Anniversary".

37:20.600 --> 37:23.520
Fair play to you. Commissioner,
perhaps you'd like
to kick things off.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.200
Thank you, Inspector.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.760
I think the best place to start
would be with Mr Laroche

37:28.840 --> 37:31.520
telling us about the affair
he had with Jasmine Springer.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.520
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.760
-I...
-I'd...

37:36.120 --> 37:39.280
Appreciate it if you didn't lie
to us, Mr Laroche.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.640
We've already wasted
enough time on this case.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.280
Close to 30 years.

37:43.360 --> 37:47.680
Look, Billy was going through
a rough patch, right?

37:47.760 --> 37:49.880
He pushed the people
that loved him away.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.120
Jasmine, you mean?

37:51.200 --> 37:52.800
Tried to help her through it.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.320
By sleeping with her.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.000
She was a grown-up.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.640
She knew what she was doing.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.240
She was also vulnerable.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.960
Her husband was an addict.
She needed support, Leon,
a friend.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.640
I'm not saying I acted
with much dignity.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.240
But, you know, we all make
mistakes in our youth.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.520
How long did it last?

38:11.360 --> 38:12.920
A few months. No more.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.280
JACK: And Billy never suspected?

38:14.360 --> 38:15.440
Most of the time back then,

38:15.520 --> 38:17.520
Billy was either drunk
or stoned or both.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.720
Jasmine and I, we were discreet.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.000
I hired a little place
up in the hills so we
wouldn't get catch.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.800
But when she threatened
to confess all to Billy,

38:27.880 --> 38:30.840
the thought of him discovering
your betrayal was too much.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.920
So you killed her.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.520
I understand how
this must look, right?

38:36.600 --> 38:39.600
But you, you have
to over-stand something,

38:39.680 --> 38:41.640
We were in a band.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.720
It was a wild time.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.560
Relationships,

38:45.640 --> 38:48.400
they can get a little blurred
when they living like that.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.000
So what are you saying, that

38:50.080 --> 38:51.240
Billy wouldn't have minded?

38:51.320 --> 38:53.560
I'm saying it wouldn't
have been the first time

38:53.640 --> 38:56.120
-things in the band
get a little...
-Dysfunctional.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.320
Billy finding out
about our fling, yes, man,

38:59.400 --> 39:01.560
it would have
complicate things.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.120
But not so much
you'd have think

39:03.200 --> 39:05.760
that the only solution
would be to kill his wife!

39:13.160 --> 39:14.360
We'll get there, sir.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.320
Just might take us
a bit more time.

39:17.400 --> 39:20.880
That's what I said to
Billy Springer
all those years ago.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.160
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

39:22.240 --> 39:24.840
I assured him we'd solve it
with a little time.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.440
-(SIGHS)
-We never did.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.960
It's not your fault, sir.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.920
You can only go
where the evidence takes you.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.880
And everything pointed
to a mugging.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.440
But I wasn't convinced
it was just a mugging.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.560
The escalation in violence
felt too marked.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.760
To me

39:45.880 --> 39:47.840
it was too much of a stretch,

39:47.920 --> 39:51.200
to go from threatening someone
for their handbag to

39:51.280 --> 39:53.280
strangling the life out of them.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.680
And did you raise this
at the time, sir,

39:55.760 --> 39:56.920
with your senior officers?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.240
I did.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.800
But I was
a mere junior detective.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.800
It's hard to get
your voice heard when
all you've got going for you

40:03.880 --> 40:05.440
is your lack of experience.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.560
Yeah.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.400
We've all been there, sir.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.120
You speak out,

40:10.200 --> 40:12.560
convinced an injustice
has been done,

40:12.640 --> 40:16.360
and all you're met with
is indifference and inaction.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.360
As you said, Inspector,

40:21.160 --> 40:22.840
such cases

40:22.920 --> 40:26.880
do indeed sit heavy
over the years.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.120
I need for us to put this right.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.240
We will, sir.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.600
We will.

40:34.360 --> 40:37.000
Delmar Brown, Maya Oprey,
Leon Laroche.

40:37.080 --> 40:40.000
Three suspects, three motives,
two murders.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.120
And, as yet, no idea
which of them is our killer.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.040
June the 5th, 1988.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.600
Jasmine Springer was murdered
and the scene staged

40:47.680 --> 40:49.760
to look like a robbery
gone wrong.

40:49.840 --> 40:53.360
Thirty years later, her husband,
Billy Springer, was shot dead,

40:53.440 --> 40:56.120
and that crime scene,
staged to look like a suicide.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.400
Leaving us puzzling,

40:57.480 --> 41:00.600
just how did our killer
manage to shoot Billy

41:00.680 --> 41:04.400
and then escape
from the crime scene with
the door locked on the inside.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.480
So any thoughts or batty ideas

41:09.560 --> 41:11.600
on how we crack
this trickiest of cases?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.440
FLORENCE: Maybe we should
call it a night.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.200
Approach things again
fresh in the morning.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.560
You're probably right, Florence.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.560
Nelson.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.560
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

41:43.960 --> 41:45.320
It's all right. I'll go.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.000
Dwayne, please.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.800
Just tell me what I have to do
to make it up to you, huh?

41:51.640 --> 41:53.640
Whatever it is, I'll do it, son.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.680
Then do what we both know you
always do and leave the island.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.760
Stay and finish your drink.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.800
-Dwayne.
-Catherine.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.280
Everything all right?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.360
Fine. Why wouldn't it be?

42:17.960 --> 42:21.640
I know how hurt your mother was
when he abandoned her.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.000
And if she was alive today,

42:23.080 --> 42:25.520
she'd be even angrier
to see him back here now.

42:25.600 --> 42:29.240
But that doesn't mean you can't
give him another chance.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.560
He's really trying.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.440
I know he is.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.920
Look, all I want to tell him
is that it's okay with us,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.400
and that we are good.

42:37.480 --> 42:40.960
I just don't believe that he
deserves my forgiveness.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.480
And maybe he doesn't.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.400
But

42:45.480 --> 42:49.520
if forgiving him might finally
bring you some peace,

42:49.600 --> 42:51.920
maybe it doesn't matter
if he deserves it or not.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.960
Nelson, are you decent?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.760
Well, Harry, fancy a brew?

43:33.080 --> 43:34.680
(SIGHS) Yep.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.760
Looks like it's just you
and me again, old fella.

44:12.520 --> 44:13.640
The key's in the lock.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.960
It's a fork, lying on the floor.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.040
There's a string missing
on Billy's guitar.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.600
The top one, the E string.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.120
Us musicians,

44:23.200 --> 44:25.560
we love to improvise, Inspector.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.200
Why kill Jasmine?

44:27.280 --> 44:30.360
Question is,
did who ever was here find it?

44:30.440 --> 44:31.840
You mean, the note?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.240
He spent the morning fixing
the pick guard on his guitar.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.160
(GASPS)

44:38.120 --> 44:40.160
Not possible. Is it?

44:41.120 --> 44:43.720
Everybody, I need a screwdriver.

44:43.800 --> 44:44.960
JP: A screwdriver? Okay.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.680
FLORENCE:
Are you feeling all right?

44:46.760 --> 44:48.360
Top of the world, Florence.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.920
I think I finally worked out
how our killer shot Billy

44:51.000 --> 44:52.720
and then left the room locked
on the inside.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.200
Well done, Chief.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.760
And in a few moments time,
if I'm right about this,

44:56.840 --> 44:58.120
we'll also know who did it.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.800
You were right, Florence,
whoever killed Billy

45:01.880 --> 45:03.800
never found our missing piece
of evidence.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.040
You don't think Billy had it
with him in the dressing room?

45:06.120 --> 45:08.240
Oh, no, it was there,
right in front of our eyes.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.360
Has been all along.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.680
You see, one thing
I've learned about reggae,

45:12.760 --> 45:15.600
this piece of the guitar here
takes a right battering.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.200
And Billy's old pick guard
was all rusty and worn,

45:18.280 --> 45:20.040
so he had to replace it
with a new one.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.160
No way.

45:27.040 --> 45:30.640
-Florence, I need you to dig out
our financial checks for me.
-Yes, sir.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.120
And Dwayne, JP, it's that time.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.240
Gather up the suspects.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.680
Yes, sir.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.480
(CYMBAL CLANGS)

45:40.440 --> 45:42.800
You know what I like most
about going to a gig?

45:42.880 --> 45:45.560
It's the half-hour or so
before the band come on stage.

45:45.640 --> 45:47.680
That sense of anticipation

45:47.760 --> 45:50.680
as you're all standing there,
waiting for it all to start.

45:50.760 --> 45:55.440
Of course, anticipation
is one thing we're
not short of here today.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.520
For some people, this moment
has been 30 years in the making.

45:58.600 --> 46:02.160
Thirty years, poor Kai has been
wondering who killed his mother.

46:02.240 --> 46:05.800
And for the same amount of time,
the island's commissioner
of police

46:05.880 --> 46:09.720
has been left burdened by the
one murder he never solved.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.040
Well, today, the waiting's over.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.920
We now know not only
who killed Jasmine Springer,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.920
but also who killed
her husband, Billy.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.640
Don't we, Leon?

46:27.960 --> 46:29.240
It wasn't me, man.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.760
JACK: No?

46:30.840 --> 46:33.080
Well, why don't we start with
the murder of Billy Springer?

46:34.520 --> 46:36.880
As the band came off-stage
after playing their gig,

46:36.960 --> 46:38.840
they all returned
to their dressing rooms.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.320
But moments later,

46:40.400 --> 46:41.400
Leon came back out,

46:42.280 --> 46:44.240
entered Billy's dressing room,

46:44.320 --> 46:46.040
and proceeded to shoot him dead.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.960
FLORENCE: Leon knew
Delmar's post-gig ritual

46:51.040 --> 46:53.160
of playing his music loud,

46:53.240 --> 46:55.040
so the gunshot was never heard,

46:55.120 --> 46:58.680
giving Leon time to stage
the scene to look like suicide.

46:58.760 --> 47:00.880
So when we arrived
and broke down the door,

47:00.960 --> 47:02.960
we found the room locked,
the key on the inside,

47:03.040 --> 47:04.400
and the gun in Billy's hand,

47:04.480 --> 47:06.920
leading us to conclude
that Billy killed himself.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.120
So just how did Leon
manage this?

47:10.960 --> 47:12.760
Well, this is how.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.000
Leon took the
key from the door,

47:15.080 --> 47:17.040
went out into the corridor
and locked it.

47:17.120 --> 47:20.920
He then proceeded
to shoulder barge the door,
breaking the lock.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.320
Returning to the room,
he closed the door

47:23.400 --> 47:26.000
and put the key
back in the lock.

47:26.080 --> 47:29.040
And this done, he did something
I believe all musicians
are good at.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.160
Delmar, you even
said it yourself,

47:31.240 --> 47:34.360
"Musicians love to improvise."
And that's what Leon did.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.800
He improvised with
what he had to hand.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.880
Just as Billy had improvised
when he was about to go on stage

47:39.960 --> 47:41.680
and he realised he'd lost
his guitar capo.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.120
So...

47:44.200 --> 47:46.840
From Billy's little tin
of guitar paraphernalia,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.760
Leon took the fork.

47:50.840 --> 47:54.040
From his guitar, he removed
a single guitar string.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.680
And with just these two items,

47:55.760 --> 47:59.080
he was able to wedge the door on
the inside of the dressing room.

47:59.160 --> 48:01.720
So first, he placed
the fork on the floor,

48:01.800 --> 48:04.360
with the guitar string
looped around the prongs.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.920
He then slid the ends of
the string under the door.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.080
And then out in the corridor,
he pulled the strings hard,

48:11.160 --> 48:13.880
wedging the fork, so it
appeared the door was locked.

48:13.960 --> 48:17.560
He then pulled out the string,
put it in his pocket,

48:17.640 --> 48:21.400
and sauntered casually
back to his own dressing room.

48:21.480 --> 48:25.040
So, we broke down the door
a few moments later,

48:25.120 --> 48:28.400
we found the room locked,
the key on the inside.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.600
We naturally assumed that Billy
had locked himself into his room

48:31.680 --> 48:32.960
before shooting himself.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.440
Now, I imagine you didn't think
we'd pay too much attention

48:37.520 --> 48:39.480
to a rusty old fork
lying on the floor.

48:39.560 --> 48:41.600
I mean, how could that possibly
have anything to do

48:41.680 --> 48:43.120
with Billy taking his own life?

48:44.560 --> 48:46.200
But once you know
Billy was murdered,

48:47.360 --> 48:49.440
then even something
as innocent as a fork

48:49.520 --> 48:52.040
suddenly starts
to look suspicious.

48:54.360 --> 48:56.000
So why did Leon do all this?

48:56.080 --> 48:58.400
Why the sudden need
to kill Billy?

48:59.440 --> 49:01.960
Kai, you said yourself,

49:02.040 --> 49:04.160
Jasmine had been playing
on your father's mind

49:04.240 --> 49:06.440
since the band got back together
over the past few weeks.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.280
I think that's why
he paid a visit

49:09.360 --> 49:12.680
to somewhere that he hadn't
been to for close to 30 years.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.040
The place where he'd hidden
all your mother's possessions

49:15.120 --> 49:16.080
after she died.

49:18.560 --> 49:22.480
And I think that's where
he found the
incriminating documents.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.240
This is what prompted him
to call the commissioner,

49:25.320 --> 49:28.640
tell him that he
found new evidence proving
who Jasmine's killer was.

49:28.720 --> 49:32.320
It says,
"Siren's Point, 8:00 pm, Leon."

49:33.680 --> 49:36.160
This proves categorically

49:36.240 --> 49:38.320
that Jasmine's body was found
at Siren's point

49:38.400 --> 49:39.680
not because she was dumped there

49:39.760 --> 49:41.600
after being killed
during a botched mugging,

49:41.680 --> 49:45.920
but because she was
invited there by Leon Laroche
and callously murdered.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.160
That right, Leon?

49:49.240 --> 49:52.120
As Billy told no one
apart from the commissioner

49:52.200 --> 49:54.760
about his discovery
of the new evidence,

49:54.840 --> 49:57.400
we assume you overheard him
leaving the phone message

49:57.480 --> 49:59.520
asking for the police's help.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.720
It's Jasmine.
I know who killed her.

50:01.800 --> 50:03.080
I found a note.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.720
In that moment, you realised
you needed to kill Billy

50:05.800 --> 50:08.840
and recover the proof
that he had.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.160
Except the note
had gone missing.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.640
So, after you killed him,

50:12.720 --> 50:14.560
you must've searched that
dressing room high and low,

50:14.640 --> 50:16.400
but you couldn't find it.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.960
FLORENCE: Which means
it was you that broke into
Billy's beach hut,

50:19.040 --> 50:20.720
looking for the note.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.760
That's right,
but it wasn't there
either, was it?

50:22.840 --> 50:24.600
Because Billy was clever.

50:24.680 --> 50:27.320
He wasn't gonna risk
leaving the note lying around
when he went on stage.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.840
No, he took it with him,

50:28.920 --> 50:31.280
hidden in the pick guard
of his guitar.

50:31.360 --> 50:34.720
But I don't understand.
Why would Leon murder Jasmine?

50:34.800 --> 50:36.960
FLORENCE: We found a recording
from the studio

50:37.040 --> 50:39.560
you were all at
the day Jasmine was killed.

50:39.640 --> 50:43.640
In it, Jasmine
was heard telling Leon
she wanted to confess to Billy

50:43.720 --> 50:45.000
what had gone on between them.

50:45.080 --> 50:46.800
JACK: We assumed they were
having an affair.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.520
And when we confronted
Leon about this,

50:48.600 --> 50:50.440
he confirmed that's
exactly what it was.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.440
But while it was true that they
had indeed engaged in an affair,

50:53.520 --> 50:57.640
what wasn't true was that their
argument that day in the studio,

50:57.720 --> 51:01.480
it wasn't just about
Jasmine revealing details
of the affair to Billy,

51:01.560 --> 51:03.440
it was about more than that,
wasn't it, Leon?

51:03.520 --> 51:05.240
FLORENCE:
When Leon admitted the affair,

51:05.320 --> 51:07.880
he told us he hired
a small place up in the hills

51:07.960 --> 51:09.640
for him and Jasmine to go to.

51:09.720 --> 51:13.040
I hired a little place up
in the hills so we
wouldn't get catch.

51:13.120 --> 51:14.920
But during the investigation,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
we went through
all the financial checks from
the year Jasmine was killed,

51:18.080 --> 51:21.000
and there was nothing suspicious
about Leon's bank accounts.

51:21.080 --> 51:22.600
That's right, and I'm assured

51:22.680 --> 51:24.800
that a sudden monthly outgoing
for an extra property

51:24.880 --> 51:26.200
would have
stood out particularly

51:26.280 --> 51:28.840
to a thorough detective
like DS Cassell here.

51:28.920 --> 51:34.560
So, we went through
the finances again just a
while ago, and we were right.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.920
No sign of him renting
a property in 1988.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.720
But there was evidence

51:39.800 --> 51:42.320
of Leon renting a house a year
earlier than that.

51:43.840 --> 51:46.640
So why the discrepancy in Leon's
timeline of events?

51:48.160 --> 51:50.000
Kai...

51:50.080 --> 51:52.440
You were two months old
when your mother died.

51:52.520 --> 51:55.880
A year after,
Leon rented that property,

51:55.960 --> 51:59.520
and therefore a year
since he and your mother
had their affair.

52:01.920 --> 52:04.400
I'm sorry, that this is how
you have to find out.

52:05.840 --> 52:07.720
I think it should come from you,
don't you think?

52:11.720 --> 52:13.320
Kai is my son.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.160
Not Billy's.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.280

was going to tell Billy.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.320
(SIGHS)

52:20.400 --> 52:22.640
And having not
got through to her
at the studio that afternoon,

52:22.720 --> 52:24.080
you gave her a note

52:24.160 --> 52:26.120
suggesting she meet you later on
that night at Siren's Point.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.480
I didn't mean to kill her.

52:32.560 --> 52:35.680
I thought she'd come round
to what I was saying,

52:35.760 --> 52:38.160
but she was so stubborn,
she wouldn't listen.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.480
I didn't know
how else to stop her.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.120
I take it you assumed
Jasmine had just binned this,

52:48.560 --> 52:51.240
but unfortunately for you, Leon,
she forgot she had it.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.560
(JACK SIGHS)

52:53.640 --> 52:55.760
All these years,
it sat in the pocket
of the jacket she wore

52:55.840 --> 52:57.760
to the studio that day.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.040
And it was only when Billy
was finally able to face

53:00.120 --> 53:01.360
going through her possessions,

53:01.440 --> 53:03.720
decades later, that he found it.

53:06.280 --> 53:09.880
How could you do that to her?

(STRAINING)

53:13.760 --> 53:15.160
(ALL STRUGGLING)

53:21.960 --> 53:24.800
JACK: He did it because
in his mind, if Billy
had ever found out,

53:24.880 --> 53:27.320
that'd be the end of everything.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.720
This was no messy
musician's fling.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.360
No, it was more serious
than that.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.320
Having to give up the son that
Billy had raised for a year,

53:35.400 --> 53:36.560
the son he loved.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.040
It would've destroyed him

53:38.840 --> 53:40.120
and the band.

53:40.200 --> 53:42.160
And ultimately, that's all
you care about, isn't it?

53:52.120 --> 53:54.080
you're desperately
pursuing the spotlight.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.680
Any little bit of
attention at all

53:55.760 --> 53:57.480
you can find to feed your ego.

Congratulations,
to cracking the case.

54:34.080 --> 54:36.440
Yes, a double murder
spanning 30 years.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.280
Two for the price of one,
if you will.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.160
You think he's all right?

54:41.240 --> 54:43.360
It's not like Dwayne
to go off on his own, you know?

54:43.440 --> 54:45.600
I know he expected Nelson
to do a runner,

54:45.680 --> 54:48.040
but just not sure he thought
it would be quite so soon.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.240
I'll take him one of these.

54:57.400 --> 54:58.720
Here. Get that into you.

54:58.800 --> 54:59.840
Oh, thanks.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.000
You doin' okay?

55:05.080 --> 55:07.240
You know what? I am.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.880
For the first time,

55:08.960 --> 55:11.200
I've actually got
some clarity in my life.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.680
Really?

55:12.760 --> 55:14.680
I need to make peace
with the old man.

55:14.760 --> 55:16.280
Right, I see.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.840
Well, good for you, Dwayne.

55:17.920 --> 55:19.960
Being the bigger man
and all that. I like it.

55:22.520 --> 55:25.040
Just... If you don't
mind me asking,

55:25.120 --> 55:27.480
how are you gonna do that,
now he's gone?

55:27.560 --> 55:29.400
Er, that's the thing, Chief.

55:30.520 --> 55:32.720
(SIGHS)

55:32.800 --> 55:35.160
I've decided that I'm going
to go and look for him.

55:35.240 --> 55:36.640
I see.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.600
But I may need some time off,

55:38.680 --> 55:39.960
if that's okay, of course.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.080
Of course.
Take as much time as you need.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.320
Thank you, Chief.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.880
No way.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.200
It can't be...

55:52.280 --> 55:53.760
Dwayne.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.400
You're not gonna believe this.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.240
Jack boy!

55:58.640 --> 55:59.640
Dwayne!

56:00.800 --> 56:02.560
I don't think I do believe it.

56:02.640 --> 56:03.680
Help!

56:03.760 --> 56:05.080
What the heck are you doing?

56:05.160 --> 56:06.440
NELSON: The boat sank!

56:06.520 --> 56:07.720
What a loser.

56:07.800 --> 56:09.320
(GROANING)

56:09.400 --> 56:11.480
I'm going to have to go
and get him, you know, Chief.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.240
He's not getting any younger.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.360
And neither am I.

56:16.440 --> 56:17.400
(GRUNTS)

56:19.320 --> 56:21.120
FLORENCE: What's going on?
JP: Is that Nelson?

56:21.200 --> 56:22.920
JACK: It is indeed.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.240
And we're rescuing him.

56:25.720 --> 56:26.760
Okay...

56:34.400 --> 56:36.640
(PANTING)

56:36.720 --> 56:39.400
DWAYNE: Where in blazes
was you going? Dominica?

56:39.480 --> 56:41.120
I wasn't going anywhere.

56:41.200 --> 56:42.880
So why you went out
in your boat then?

56:42.960 --> 56:44.840
I was moving it around the bay.

56:44.920 --> 56:48.200
George Lopes said
I could moor it at his place.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.320
You mean you
wasn't leaving the island?

56:50.400 --> 56:54.320
-I told you, like it or lump it,
I'm not going anywhere.
-(GROANS)

56:54.400 --> 56:56.280
You must let me
buy you all a drink.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.560
-DWAYNE: What?
-As a thank you.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.600
One drink? You cheapskate.

57:00.680 --> 57:02.880
You mean, we saved your life
for one drink?

57:02.960 --> 57:04.440
CATHERINE:
Don't worry about that.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.880
The drinks will be on the house.

57:07.080 --> 57:10.160
(WHIMPERING)

57:10.240 --> 57:11.480
CATHERINE:
I'll look after you, Nelson.

57:11.560 --> 57:12.720
NELSON: Thanks, Catherine.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.440
CATHERINE:
Come on, let's get you dry.

57:16.240 --> 57:17.800
He's gonna want
my spare room back, isn't he?

57:17.880 --> 57:19.960
(LAUGHS) Almost definitely, sir.

57:22.760 --> 57:25.320
JACK: Probably want my clothes
as well, and my shoes.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.360
(LAUGHING)

57:27.440 --> 57:29.560
I'm gonna have to move in
with you, Florence.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.960
(LAUGHS) Only joking.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.680
