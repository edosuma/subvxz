[helicopter hovering]

00:24.958 --> 00:26.458
[Crane] Buck up,
snowflake.

00:28.958 --> 00:30.916
We've eluded our overdudes.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.250
Now it's time to boogie.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.250
Did you even see
what happened back there?

00:36.333 --> 00:39.541
Well, the part where
we skirted catastrophe
and emerged victorious?

00:40.458 --> 00:42.500
I did. Bully for us.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.083
[laughs]<i> Et voila.</i>

00:44.166 --> 00:45.666
We barely made it out of there.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.416
Ah, details.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.416
We won. Nightwing lost.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.083
You don't know him.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.875
He won't stop. Not after Hawk.

00:54.416 --> 00:56.000
Hawk? Who's Hawk?

00:56.083 --> 00:57.750
Oh, right. The big fella.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.250
With the bomb.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.041
It's hard to keep
you guys straight.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.625
So many of you are birds.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.583
Dick knows everything now.

01:04.666 --> 01:06.250
Okay? We're fucked.

01:06.916 --> 01:08.250
Hey!

01:08.333 --> 01:10.291
You need to make me believe
you have a fucking plan.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.875
You need to stop
being afraid of Dick Grayson.

01:11.958 --> 01:13.208
I'm not afraid of him!

01:13.291 --> 01:15.875
Of course you are.
Hold onto that fear.

01:15.958 --> 01:17.416
Use it

01:17.500 --> 01:19.750
-[gun cocks]
-I should fucking kill you
right now.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.166
A lot of people should kill me.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.916
I need to know
the fucking plan!

01:24.041 --> 01:27.375
The plan is simple.

01:27.458 --> 01:30.666
We immerse the good citizens
of Gotham in a world
of fear and terror,

01:30.750 --> 01:32.833
where there is no one
to protect them.

01:32.916 --> 01:36.375
And when they feel that
all hope has been exhausted,
we swoop in

01:36.458 --> 01:38.416
and be the answer
to their fear.

01:40.041 --> 01:42.000
Eh, you feed a starving dog,

01:42.083 --> 01:43.666
it's always by your side.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.958
Why don't we get you a little
hit of your happy juice
and then we'll be on our way?

01:51.541 --> 01:52.708
Here you go.

01:53.708 --> 01:54.750
That's it.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.791
-[inhaler hisses]
-[inhales deeply]

01:59.875 --> 02:01.041
All better now?

02:02.500 --> 02:03.833
No.

04:07.708 --> 04:08.875
You're okay.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.125
You're safe.

Jason, you're home.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.833
I'm fine.

-I'm fine.
-You were screaming.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.916
[grunts]

04:24.000 --> 04:26.791
[Jason] Got to meet someone
in the city.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.833
It's been a few weeks
of these dreams.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.125
You sure you're okay?

04:32.208 --> 04:34.625
You shouldn't ask people
if they're okay.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.916
You're not really good at it.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.125
[Bruce sighs]

04:43.208 --> 04:45.416
Bruce, I didn't mean... [sighs]

04:45.500 --> 04:47.416
People have bad dreams.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.750
It's not a thing.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.625
[Bruce inhales deeply]

04:51.708 --> 04:53.791
I'd like you to see
an old friend of mine.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.166
Dr. Leslie Thompkins.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.250
What kind of doctor?

04:58.333 --> 05:00.125
[Bruce] A psychologist.

05:00.208 --> 05:01.291
[scoffs]

05:01.375 --> 05:03.041
You're sending me
to a shrink?

05:03.125 --> 05:04.500
Because I have fucking dreams?

05:04.583 --> 05:06.250
She's more than simply
a psychologist.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.500
She knows everything
about me.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.333
She understands
the work we do.

05:09.416 --> 05:10.958
I've done my time
with shrinks.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.125
Not gonna happen.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
No more Robin
until you see her.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.291
What?

05:22.375 --> 05:25.083
I've set an appointment
for tomorrow.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.750
Bruce, please don't do this.

05:27.541 --> 05:29.041
I'm fine.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.750
If Leslie agrees with you,
you can go back to being Robin.

05:30.833 --> 05:34.041
But until I hear
the word from her,
you're shut down.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.250
["Deliverance" by The Mission

06:02.750 --> 06:04.416
-[Molly] Hey.
-Sorry I'm late. Molly.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.250
It's cool.
I ordered for you.

06:07.958 --> 06:10.041
God, you look tired.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.041
You sleeping?

06:13.125 --> 06:14.625
You still trying to save me?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.041
Always.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.291
[chuckles softly]

06:18.375 --> 06:19.666
What are you working on?

06:23.541 --> 06:25.625
Diego from the shelter
went missing.

06:25.708 --> 06:29.583
Rumor is, the Joker's
got a dude on the street
taking in strays.

06:29.666 --> 06:34.666
Diego's poor and brown,
so, you know
the cops don't give a shit.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.291
Batman will take care of him.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.416
Batman protects rich people.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.375
Careful, J.

06:43.458 --> 06:46.500
Living in that fake house
got you slipping.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.791
Should've stayed
in San Francisco.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.541
Fuck San Francisco.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.916
That whole thing was a mistake.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.500
Gotham's where I need to be.

06:59.916 --> 07:02.083
You've been different
since you've been back.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.000
-Different how?
-I don't know.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.750
Like something happened
over there.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.125
Nothing happened.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.791
I was bored, so I left.

07:15.791 --> 07:17.375
Okay.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.000
Look, if you don't want
to talk about it--

07:19.083 --> 07:21.541
Where's this guy who's
picking up the street kids?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.625
I heard he's hanging near
a shelter on Dunsmuir.

07:26.708 --> 07:28.375
Show me.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.333
[scoffs] Right.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.791
-'Cause you're a cop now.
-I'm serious.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.583
Let's just go
see if he's there.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.000
And then what?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.250
Take some photos.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.541
Show them to the cops.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.083
It's worth trying.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.000
I know that look.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.625
What look?

07:54.750 --> 07:57.250
The one that
used to get me in trouble.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.875
[Jason] You still with
what's her name?

08:05.958 --> 08:07.083
Sheila?

08:07.166 --> 08:09.208
[Molly] Nah.
Sheila was the wrong one.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.041
I might even date boys again.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.333
Over there.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.833
Gotta be him.

08:25.791 --> 08:26.708
Got it?

08:27.833 --> 08:29.416
[Jason] Hold on.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.541
Name's Pete Hawkins.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.708
Piece of shit's been
in and out of Blackgate.

08:33.791 --> 08:35.625
Gooned up with
the Joker last year.

08:35.708 --> 08:36.958
How do you know that?

08:37.041 --> 08:37.875
Told you.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.458
I'm still me.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.541
Right. That's one of those
things that sounds real cool,

08:42.625 --> 08:44.958
but doesn't actually
mean anything.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.541
Let's go introduce ourselves.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.583
-J--
-Just a conversation.

08:49.666 --> 08:50.791
That's all.

Come on.

[sighs]

09:00.583 --> 09:03.041
[girl grunts] What's in this?
It's really strong.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.583
[Hawkins] You look like
you can handle it.

09:04.666 --> 09:06.666
-[girl laughs]
-[Hawkins] I love your smile.

09:07.666 --> 09:09.333
What if I told you

09:09.416 --> 09:11.000
I could introduce you
to someone
that would make you smile,

09:11.083 --> 09:12.208
all the time?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.958
[Jason] It never
works out like that.

09:21.875 --> 09:22.916
Give us a second.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.625
Keep the drink.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.000
We have a problem?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.583
A little young for you,
isn't she, hoss?

09:31.666 --> 09:34.041
She's old enough
to make her own choices.

09:35.541 --> 09:36.750
Do I know you?

09:36.833 --> 09:39.500
I'm "Fuck." She's "Off."

09:40.500 --> 09:41.958
We hate clowns.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.166
Clowns?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.500
Maybe you ran across a kid?

09:49.583 --> 09:51.500
-Diego.
-Martinez.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.708
You know him?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.958
You must have me
confused with someone else.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.375
You haven't done
enough time

10:11.458 --> 10:12.958
to look at me like that.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.708
You have no idea who I am.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.541
J, let's get out of here.

10:21.625 --> 10:22.541

[both grunting]

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Stop it!

10:48.208 --> 10:49.416
Stop it!

10:50.958 --> 10:52.583
Stop it, please.

10:52.666 --> 10:54.125
[Jason coughing]

10:56.291 --> 10:57.583
Just for you, cutie.

10:59.958 --> 11:01.625
[continues coughing]

11:03.583 --> 11:05.333
I'll see you around.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.375
[car door opens and closes]

11:07.458 --> 11:09.041
-Jason!
-[engine starts]

11:10.250 --> 11:11.250
Jason.

11:13.791 --> 11:15.083
[car driving away]

11:17.125 --> 11:18.250
Get off of me!

11:19.958 --> 11:21.083
Look, you're hurt.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.208
We need to get you
to a hospital--

11:22.291 --> 11:24.375
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.375
Just tell me what
I can do to help--

11:27.458 --> 11:29.875
Get the fuck away
from me, okay?

11:29.958 --> 11:32.083
Go! Get the fuck
away from me!

11:33.333 --> 11:34.458
I said go!

11:42.125 --> 11:45.333
[Jason] Smells like fucking
French fries in here.

11:45.416 --> 11:46.916
Wednesday is my cheat day.

11:53.916 --> 11:54.958
Have a seat.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.000
You want the emotional shit
and then I can leave, right?

12:00.083 --> 12:02.708
Big fan of the emotional shit.

12:02.791 --> 12:05.875
My mother was a smack addict
and it killed her.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.083
My dad was murdered
by Two-Face.

12:08.166 --> 12:12.125
Add three years of foster care
bullshit and I'm probably
fucked up, okay?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.125
Look, I'm having bad dreams,
I'm off my game.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.500
Just give me the pill.

12:18.583 --> 12:21.250
-The pill?
-That's what you
fucking do, right?

12:21.333 --> 12:25.708
You get people to open up
about their shit
and you give them pills.

12:25.791 --> 12:28.125
Happened to me when
I was bouncing around State.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.625
Ritalin.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.708
Adderall. Dexedrine.

12:32.791 --> 12:34.791
And something else
I can't remember.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.333
-Did the pills help?
-I never took 'em.

12:37.416 --> 12:40.375
First foster family
took the scripts
before they got to me.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.916
Well, medication's
an option but--

12:42.000 --> 12:43.583
That's Jonathan Crane.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.583
Yes.

12:56.916 --> 12:58.416
You knew the Scarecrow?

13:00.375 --> 13:03.875
He wasn't the "Scarecrow"
when I knew him.

13:03.958 --> 13:07.000
He was actually a brilliant
graduate student.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.250
Obsessed with fear.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.500
Driven by ego.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.333
He had real insight.

13:14.416 --> 13:15.541
He was my friend.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.250
Until he tried to kill me.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.500
What happened?

13:23.583 --> 13:26.250
He poisoned me with his gas.

13:26.333 --> 13:30.208
He blamed me for betraying him
when I find out about
his experiments.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.750
His fear gas?

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
Yes.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.333
What was it like?

13:38.666 --> 13:40.416
We're here to talk about you.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.833
My session. My money.

13:42.916 --> 13:44.416
Answer the question.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.250
It was as close to hell
as you can get
when you're alive.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.625
If Bruce hadn't saved me...

14:03.791 --> 14:05.541
I still have nightmares
about it.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.875
If you're that fucked up,
how are you a therapist?

14:12.583 --> 14:14.208
I'm honest.

14:14.291 --> 14:16.916
That's how this process starts.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.250
I told you my truth.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.375
What's yours?

14:19.458 --> 14:20.875
What's that supposed to mean?

14:20.958 --> 14:24.541
Crane's specialty
was terrorizing his victims

14:24.625 --> 14:26.333
with their worst fear.

14:28.625 --> 14:29.750
What's yours?

14:35.750 --> 14:38.083
Being stuck in this room
with you for the rest
of my life,

14:38.166 --> 14:39.500
talking about my shit.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.041
First days are hard.

14:45.666 --> 14:47.291
We'll see how tomorrow goes.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.500
That's it?

14:49.166 --> 14:50.416
We're done?

14:50.500 --> 14:52.208
[Leslie] Come back
and we'll try again.

14:54.416 --> 14:56.541
I might even tell you
a story about Superman.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.541
[soft whirring]

15:11.625 --> 15:12.666
[door unlocks]

15:53.541 --> 15:55.041
[Bruce] Thoughts about Leslie?

15:56.625 --> 15:58.458
You shouldn't creep up
on people.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.375
It's a skill
that comes in handy.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.083
How did it go?

16:02.916 --> 16:04.125
Okay.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.875
You're looking
at my Scarecrow keepsakes.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.541
Leslie told you
about her encounter?

16:11.500 --> 16:12.458
She tell you that?

16:12.541 --> 16:14.000
No.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.250
What goes on in your sessions
is between you and her.

16:18.708 --> 16:22.333
People underestimate
the power of fear.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.500
Leslie did too,
until she ran into Scarecrow.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.083
She was lucky to survive.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.000
It made her a better therapist.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.250
She's kind of hot.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.583
Did you two ever--

16:33.666 --> 16:37.250
I've got a conference call
with Metropolis tonight.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.041
Luther is up to something.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.458
Can you handle dinner?

16:43.458 --> 16:45.250
Yeah. I'll order in.

16:47.458 --> 16:48.541
You wanna tell me something?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.916
Uh... Spilled off the bike.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.666
Anyway,

16:53.750 --> 16:55.416
the suit's locked up.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.666
I'm benched.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.250
It's the way you want it,
right?

16:58.333 --> 16:59.750
[Bruce] For now.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.708
Seeing Leslie was a huge step
to getting back on track.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.375
I know it wasn't easy.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.750
I'm proud of you, son.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.208
Son?

17:18.791 --> 17:19.833
Yeah.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.625
The Ducati's gassed up.

17:31.708 --> 17:34.500
If this new girl likes cats...
run.

17:37.000 --> 17:37.958
[chuckles softly]

17:43.875 --> 17:46.541
-[Leslie]<i> Mother.</i>
-[Jason]<i> Fucker.</i>

17:51.541 --> 17:52.583
Sorry, my bad.

17:55.250 --> 17:56.208
Don't apologize.

17:56.291 --> 17:57.583
[pen scratching on paper]

17:57.666 --> 17:58.500
Mother.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.166
Gone.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.375
[Leslie] Father.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.833
Bruce.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.166
[Leslie] San Francisco.

18:08.625 --> 18:09.541
Rose.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.291
[Leslie] Friend.

18:11.958 --> 18:12.958
Molly.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.041
Robin.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Freedom.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.125
The other day when
you were in the alley,

18:22.208 --> 18:24.541
when that man
had the gun pointed at you,

18:25.750 --> 18:26.916
were you afraid?

18:27.791 --> 18:28.875
Why?

18:28.958 --> 18:31.125
Robin's not supposed
to be afraid.

18:31.208 --> 18:33.000
Bruce puts a lot
of pressure on you.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.625
It's not his fault
I keep fucking it up.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.500
If he thinks
I'm scared, he'll...

18:39.708 --> 18:40.916
He'll what?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.875
I can't be like this.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.166
This?

18:51.250 --> 18:53.833
I'm tired of being afraid.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.291
Freaking out all the time.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.333
The nightmares,
the hand shaking, all of it.

18:58.416 --> 19:01.666
Once he loses faith
in somebody,
he takes it all away.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.083
[Leslie] Okay.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.416
Say he stops you
from being Robin.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.500
You just get to be you,
Jason Todd.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.583
Jason Todd lived on the streets
and he ate out of dumpsters.

19:11.666 --> 19:14.541
My life isn't shit
without Robin.

19:14.625 --> 19:17.666
-Does Molly know
that you're Robin?
-Fuck no.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.000
Molly likes Jason.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.333
'Cause Jason's a real person.

19:24.416 --> 19:27.416
Robin, on the other hand,
is a construct,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.958
made by a crime-fighting
vigilante

19:30.041 --> 19:33.583
who has a borderline
personality disorder.

19:33.666 --> 19:36.958
Robin is the living embodiment
of that man's projection.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.208
And that's...

19:38.291 --> 19:40.291
what you're afraid
of not being?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.208
A ghost.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.250
No.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.375
[Leslie] So what are you
afraid of?

19:49.458 --> 19:52.916
Not being Robin
or having to be yourself?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.500
And I know you won't
believe this, but...

19:55.583 --> 19:59.041
you'll survive just fine
without a costume.

19:59.125 --> 20:03.166
[scoffs] Is that what
you're going to tell Bruce?

20:03.250 --> 20:05.958
I'll tell him whatever
you want me to.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.041
But he said you had to
sign off on me going back.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.750
[Leslie] Bruce is not
my patient.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.125
What do you want?

20:15.166 --> 20:16.291
To feel better.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.916
[Leslie] Then let's
keep talking.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.625
If after all this,

20:22.708 --> 20:25.250
you want to be Robin again,
that's great.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.833
If not, great also.
Work for you?

20:29.750 --> 20:30.750
Yeah.

20:32.541 --> 20:34.041
Next week, same time?

20:34.833 --> 20:35.875
Yeah, sure.

20:38.041 --> 20:39.083
Thanks.

20:39.791 --> 20:40.958
Thank yourself.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.083
You're the one
that's doing the work.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.375
Jason, wait.

20:48.416 --> 20:50.875
Just because you're afraid,
doesn't mean you're broken.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.291
I want you to hear someone
say that and mean it.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.000
I'll see you soon.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.250
[engine roaring]

21:32.166 --> 21:33.708
[engine accelerating]

21:55.708 --> 21:57.208
Put the phone away, please.

22:23.833 --> 22:25.500
This is where
your parents died.

22:30.541 --> 22:32.541
I was standing
right where you are.

22:36.333 --> 22:40.750
Everything that made sense
left my life in one moment.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.750
-Bruce, we don't have
to talk about--
-Let me finish.

22:50.625 --> 22:53.208
Everything I've done
is to help you, son.

22:55.916 --> 22:56.916
I know.

22:59.916 --> 23:01.416
What I brought you into...

23:02.875 --> 23:03.875
Robin...

23:05.416 --> 23:07.583
is tearing you apart.

23:07.666 --> 23:09.291
It wasn't fair of me
to push you.

23:10.666 --> 23:11.791
You didn't push me.

23:12.666 --> 23:13.916
I needed this.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.125
This city does things to us.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.750
It can take
the worst parts of ourselves

23:22.833 --> 23:24.333
and put them in control.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.083
Sometimes I think it's alive.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.416
Like it has a will.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.208
And it wants us
to destroy ourselves.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.291
I've lost too many people
to Gotham.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.625
I won't lose you.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.458
You won't.

23:49.541 --> 23:51.291
You can't make that promise,

23:52.041 --> 23:53.291
but I can keep it.

23:58.208 --> 23:59.916
I don't want you to be Robin.

24:04.041 --> 24:06.916
You... You talked to Leslie.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.833
I didn't speak to her.
This is my decision alone.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.250
Bullshit.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.958
Hey, what did she tell you,
that I'm a fucking mental case?

24:14.041 --> 24:16.416
She didn't tell me anything.
This has nothing to do

24:16.500 --> 24:18.625
with your psychological
condition. Just hear--

24:18.708 --> 24:21.166
I did exactly what you
asked me to do.

24:22.458 --> 24:24.000
I went to Leslie.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.916
I talked to her.
She's helping me out.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.916
Please don't take this
away from me.

24:30.375 --> 24:33.458
You don't need to wear
a costume to be my son.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.500
You think I'm weak.

24:40.666 --> 24:43.125
You always thought I was weak.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.708
You never did this to Dick.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.333
It's a different matter.

24:47.416 --> 24:49.333
I've learned from my mistakes.

24:49.416 --> 24:51.416
Oh, so I'm
a fucking mistake now?

24:52.250 --> 24:54.625
You gave Dick everything!

24:54.708 --> 24:55.916
And no matter what he does,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.875
you keep on giving him
more and more.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.333
Why don't you do that with me?

25:03.416 --> 25:05.208
What's so bad about me?

25:06.750 --> 25:08.625
Please, just hear
what I'm saying.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.416
This is not your fault.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.625
Please don't give up
on me, Bruce.

25:20.416 --> 25:21.541
I never will.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.416
But I've made my choice.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.333
I've got to go
to London tonight.

25:34.416 --> 25:37.125
Business. You come with me.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.500
We could both use time
away from Gotham.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.583
You're wrong about me.

25:45.708 --> 25:46.750
I'll prove it.

25:48.166 --> 25:50.458
-Jason.
-You're wrong.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.375
[siren wailing in distance]

26:03.833 --> 26:05.750
[cell phone vibrating]

26:11.833 --> 26:13.291
Leslie Thompkins.

26:13.375 --> 26:14.833
Word association.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.291
You know the game, right?

26:19.791 --> 26:20.750
<i>Liar.</i>

26:20.833 --> 26:21.958
Jason, where are you?

26:22.625 --> 26:23.625
Liar!

26:24.333 --> 26:25.375
Jason?

26:41.666 --> 26:43.541
[Crane grunting]

26:43.625 --> 26:45.208
Oh, you are very sly.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.291
But so am I.

26:47.833 --> 26:50.208
[laughs]

26:50.291 --> 26:52.666
Ah. [sighs]

26:52.750 --> 26:54.291
You must be hungry.

26:54.375 --> 26:56.458
Let me get you your lunch.

26:56.541 --> 26:57.958
You want salad?

26:58.041 --> 26:59.458
Cyrus,

26:59.541 --> 27:02.875
would you be so kind
as to get me a lighter, please?

27:02.958 --> 27:04.083
Jonathan Crane.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.125
Whose little boy are you?

27:08.083 --> 27:09.708
I'm working with the Gotham PD.

27:11.666 --> 27:12.666
[Crane scoffs]

27:13.458 --> 27:14.750
Credentials, please.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.083
No?

27:20.166 --> 27:22.750
Lying makes you feel icky,
doesn't it?

27:24.250 --> 27:26.250
[sighs] Well,
whomever you are...

27:27.416 --> 27:29.708
[sighs] You got fire? [sniffs]

27:29.791 --> 27:30.958
[Jason] What?

27:31.041 --> 27:32.000
For the strain.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.708
-No.
-Oh.

27:35.833 --> 27:36.666
Well...

27:37.541 --> 27:38.666
then run along.

27:39.916 --> 27:41.875
Cut the pothead act, okay?

27:41.958 --> 27:43.166
I know you're the Scarecrow.

27:43.250 --> 27:44.583
Everyone knows that.

27:44.666 --> 27:46.083
You created the fear gas.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.083
That was my former life.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.583
I'm a good citizen now.

27:49.666 --> 27:51.708
In fact,
I'm on the Gotham PD payroll

27:51.791 --> 27:54.000
as a consultant,
which you would know

27:54.083 --> 27:56.875
if you were
actually in the Gotham PD.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.375
Now move along, fan boy.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.375
Listen to me, you sick fuck.

28:01.791 --> 28:04.083
You made a fear gas, right?

28:04.166 --> 28:06.416
That means you can make
something to get rid of fear.

28:06.500 --> 28:10.125
Well, I admire your logic
recto verso.

28:10.208 --> 28:12.500
Even if I could,
what on Earth makes you think

28:12.583 --> 28:15.000
I would share it
with a C-list impostor?
