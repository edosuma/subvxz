-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain.
-<i> Too long I've lived.</i>

00:04.438 --> 00:06.438
<i> Too much I've seen.</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:09.141
(screaming)
Strigoi!

00:09.143 --> 00:12.478
-<i> I've seen them in the tunnels.</i>
<i> It's turning people into</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.780
hungry vermin.
- They are

00:14.782 --> 00:17.549
<i> no longer people. And to think</i>
<i> they are is very dangerous.</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:20.486
- You do not have
the luxury of choice anymore.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.321
All we can do now is fight.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.057
- (man):<i> Is the war</i>
<i> already lost?</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:28.627
<i> Are we destined to be</i>
<i> cattle for monsters or now</i>

00:28.629 --> 00:30.896
<i> that the enemy has shown</i>
<i> his face, do we have</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:34.500
<i> a fighting chance?</i>
(creatures screaming)

00:34.502 --> 00:37.236
- I've kept my part
of the agreement;

00:37.238 --> 00:39.238
<i> the Master will keep his.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:41.073
- Behold.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.475
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
- (boy): What about Mom, Dad?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.811
-<i> I don't know where your mom</i>
<i> is, but I'm gonna find her.</i>

00:45.813 --> 00:47.246
No!
- (boy): Mom!

00:47.248 --> 00:50.749
- It's not her anymore!
- (boy): No! Mom!

00:50.751 --> 00:51.984
-<i> The Master will use</i>
<i> your wife's love...</i>

00:51.986 --> 00:54.153
- Eph, don't.
<i> - ...for her son</i>

00:54.155 --> 00:58.323
to pursue us
to the ends of the Earth.

00:58.325 --> 01:01.260
- Let him try.
-<i> Despite all evidence</i>

01:01.262 --> 01:03.328
<i> to the contrary, you cling</i>

01:03.330 --> 01:05.864
to the delusion
that you will prevail?

01:05.866 --> 01:09.768
The great game is over, Jew.
- Not while I still breathe.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.606
(barking)

01:18.245 --> 01:22.514
- Abraham Setrakian,
come and have your soup.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.417
Abraham!

01:25.419 --> 01:28.520
- I'm not hungry.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.792
Tell me one more story,<i> Bubbeh.</i>
- It's late now, Abraham.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.362
There's barely enough
time for a tale. Maybe...

01:37.364 --> 01:40.966
while you finish your soup.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.235
What story do you want to hear?

01:43.237 --> 01:46.371
- Sardu,<i> Bubbeh.</i>
Will you tell me his story?

01:46.373 --> 01:49.074
- Sardu? Again?

01:49.076 --> 01:51.810
Even if it is a scary one?

01:53.380 --> 01:55.614
Very well, Abraham.

01:55.616 --> 01:59.318
But I want a clean plate
at the end of it all.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.256
There once was a great nobleman

02:04.258 --> 02:06.725
named Jusef Sardu.

02:06.727 --> 02:10.929
Since childhood,
he suffered from gigantism.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.998
His body was aged,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.901
his bones were bent
and riddled with aches,

02:15.903 --> 02:18.570
so he was forced
to walk with a cane.

02:20.508 --> 02:24.109
<i> His was a beautiful sword-cane</i>

02:24.111 --> 02:28.247
<i> with a white-gold handle</i>
<i> and a silver blade.</i>

02:28.249 --> 02:30.916
(in foreign language)

02:30.918 --> 02:32.584
(speaking foreign language)

02:32.586 --> 02:36.121
<i> His disease made him aware</i>

02:36.123 --> 02:38.023
<i> of the frailty of life.</i>

02:38.025 --> 02:41.293
<i> So as a result, he was</i>

02:41.295 --> 02:44.930
<i> very kind to others,</i>
<i> especially children.</i>

02:44.932 --> 02:48.200
(Sardu and children
speaking in foreign language)

02:48.202 --> 02:50.135
(Sardu laughing)

02:50.137 --> 02:52.004
(Sardu speaking
in foreign language)

02:52.006 --> 02:55.774
<i> However, Sardu's brother,</i>

02:55.776 --> 03:00.679
<i> the baron, was shamed</i>
<i> by his sibling's affliction.</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:03.615
<i> He organized a hunting trip</i>

03:03.617 --> 03:05.984
<i> with his brother</i>
<i> and his cousins,</i>

03:05.986 --> 03:10.322
<i> because he believed the blood</i>
<i> of the Great Grey Wolf</i>

03:10.324 --> 03:12.624
<i> could cure the disease</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:15.694
<i> afflicting Jusef.</i>
(dogs barking)

03:17.898 --> 03:20.566
<i> Day after day,</i>

03:20.568 --> 03:25.470
<i> they walked in search</i>
<i> of the Great Grey Wolf.</i>

03:25.472 --> 03:28.140
(men laughing and speaking
in foreign language)

03:33.147 --> 03:35.314
(strange croaking)

03:35.316 --> 03:38.183
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:38.185 --> 03:40.185
(word in foreign language)

03:40.187 --> 03:44.489
- (Bubbeh):<i> But...</i>
<i> something other than a wolf</i>

03:44.491 --> 03:46.992
<i> was alive in the woods.</i>

03:46.994 --> 03:49.094
(man speaking foreign language)

03:49.096 --> 03:52.231
(creature croaking
and growling)

03:54.501 --> 03:56.768
(man speaking foreign language)

03:56.770 --> 03:59.938
- (Bubbeh):<i> And it started</i>
<i> hunting them.</i>

03:59.940 --> 04:03.875
<i> One by one, the members</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:06.011
<i> of the hunting party left...</i>

04:06.013 --> 04:08.046
(creature growling)

04:08.048 --> 04:14.353
<i> ...until Jusef found himself</i>
<i> completely alone.</i>

04:14.355 --> 04:17.789
(Sardu panting)

04:20.861 --> 04:23.695
<i> A certainty grew in his heart:</i>

04:23.697 --> 04:26.098
<i> his brethren were dead,</i>

04:26.100 --> 04:28.133
<i> and it was up to him</i>

04:28.135 --> 04:30.269
<i> to kill the beast</i>

04:30.271 --> 04:32.671
<i> or die trying.</i>

04:44.718 --> 04:48.453
Finish your soup, Abraham,
and I'll finish my tale.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.727
When he finally

04:55.729 --> 04:58.664
encountered the creature...

04:58.666 --> 05:01.933
it was not a wolf at all.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.469
(Sardu panting)

05:29.997 --> 05:32.297
(strange growling)

05:32.299 --> 05:33.999
(flesh tearing sound)

05:34.001 --> 05:37.669
<i> It was an ancient,</i>
<i> hungry being.</i>

05:39.640 --> 05:41.940
<i> And as it gazed</i>

05:41.942 --> 05:46.345
<i>at the giant's body, it smiled.</i>

05:49.283 --> 05:52.050
- Young hunter.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.623
So, you think

05:58.625 --> 06:01.059
you're going to kill me...

06:01.061 --> 06:03.628
with that?

06:03.630 --> 06:05.897
(growling)

06:08.802 --> 06:12.537
I can smell the silver
on the blade.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.874
(laughing)

06:15.876 --> 06:21.146
Do you think you are faster

06:21.148 --> 06:23.582
than me?

06:32.659 --> 06:35.827
(coughing)

06:35.829 --> 06:39.264
(Sardu groaning)
- This body:

06:39.266 --> 06:41.266
frail, brittle.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.769
My will, my soul...

06:43.771 --> 06:46.938
(Sardu groaning)

06:46.940 --> 06:50.242
...I pass unto you.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.846
- Ah!

06:54.848 --> 06:57.516
(Sardu coughing)

07:00.020 --> 07:01.753
- As a blessing,

07:01.755 --> 07:04.856
I bestow them.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.325
(Sardu groaning)

07:20.908 --> 07:23.008
(Sardu growling)

07:26.380 --> 07:29.681
(Sardu screaming)

07:34.054 --> 07:36.455
(panting)

07:47.935 --> 07:51.470
(soft growling)

07:58.412 --> 08:01.780
- (Bubbeh):<i> Sardu returned</i>
<i> to his village weeks later,</i>

08:01.782 --> 08:04.249
<i> but was never again seen</i>

08:04.251 --> 08:07.452
<i> outside his castle walls.</i>

08:07.454 --> 08:10.455
<i> Not in daylight, that is.</i>

08:10.457 --> 08:13.792
<i> Some say he was much changed.</i>

08:13.794 --> 08:17.496
(weird croaking)

08:19.433 --> 08:21.266
<i> And soon,</i>

08:21.268 --> 08:24.769
<i> young children began</i>
<i> disappearing from the village,</i>

<i> at night.</i>

08:27.841 --> 08:30.242
(soft growling)

08:33.780 --> 08:39.684
<i> And while no one ever saw</i>
<i> Sardu again,</i>

08:39.686 --> 08:43.555
<i> some said they heard</i>
<i> his cane in the night.</i>

08:43.557 --> 08:46.057
(tapping on window)

08:46.059 --> 08:48.860
(tapping knife on table)

08:56.470 --> 08:58.470
Evil...

08:58.472 --> 09:01.406
lurks in the world, Abraham,

09:01.408 --> 09:03.508
in many forms.

09:03.510 --> 09:07.345
Some familiar, some not.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.315
You must stop it.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.351
We all must.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.921
(cane tapping on floor)

09:23.430 --> 09:25.664

Show yourself!

12:09.162 --> 12:12.497

12:12.499 --> 12:14.432
- Where is he?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.501
- I was wondering
the same thing myself.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.513
- Who are you?
- My name is Vaun.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.057
(distant tires squealing)

13:17.264 --> 13:19.330
- Never thought
I'd be nostalgic

13:19.332 --> 13:21.800
for rats!
- Yeah!

13:21.802 --> 13:24.269
Vampire-proofing is, uh,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.237
a lot more labor intensive than

13:26.239 --> 13:28.840
rat-proofing.
- Where's Setrakian?

13:28.842 --> 13:31.976
- He left before I got up.
- Where to?

13:31.978 --> 13:34.012
- He's not big on leaving notes.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.014
Hey, you wanna
help me out with this?

13:39.486 --> 13:42.320
(distant sirens blaring)

13:42.322 --> 13:44.455
(fire truck horn honking)

13:44.457 --> 13:46.691
- He said sunlight
would kill that thing.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.694
We chased it into the sun,
it got away.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.696
- Everybody makes mistakes,

13:51.698 --> 13:54.132
even vampire hunters...

13:54.134 --> 13:56.134
even doctors.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.970
- So you're still on board?
You're still ready

13:58.972 --> 14:01.206
to follow him down
every dark tunnel in the city?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.007
- Yeah.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.610
But I've got my own plan.
- Which is?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.879
- I'm gonna secure my place,

14:07.881 --> 14:10.315
then next door,

14:10.317 --> 14:12.851
then the block,
and then the next block.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.289
- The ground game
isn't for me.

14:18.291 --> 14:22.160
(distant yelling)
- So what are you gonna do?

14:22.162 --> 14:24.128
(wind whistling)

14:24.130 --> 14:27.232
- Well, seeing as how as a
vampire hunter, I'm total shit,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.701
I'm gonna go back
to being a doctor.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.576
- (man):<i> At the press conference</i>

14:55.495 --> 14:58.596
- Dutch. You could use
some ventilation there.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.565
- Yeah. And a latte
with almond milk

15:00.567 --> 15:02.400
and a massage
from the Four Seasons.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.502
- When Zack gets up,
could you make sure

15:04.504 --> 15:06.671
he gets some breakfast?
- (Dutch): Where are you going?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.673
- Out.
- Got it. Yeah, no problem.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.276
I'll just feed your kid and make
sure this place is vampire-safe

You're just so
bloody presumptuous.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.029
Not very smart.
- Silence.

18:18.031 --> 18:21.766
You will approach
with all due respect.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.112
(growling and croaking)

18:56.769 --> 18:58.769
- They exist...

18:58.771 --> 19:01.806
the Ancients.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.911
- They're sleeping now,

19:06.913 --> 19:10.515
but they can hear
and understand everything.

19:10.517 --> 19:14.018
I speak for them.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.020
What do you know

19:16.022 --> 19:19.023
of the seventh one
of their kind?

19:19.025 --> 19:21.926
- The... the seventh?

19:21.928 --> 19:25.530
- The one you call the Master.
You injured him.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.832
- How do you know this?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.868
- The seven share
a common mind.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.638
But the seventh...

19:33.640 --> 19:36.541
has the power
to disrupt thought.

19:36.543 --> 19:40.378
When you injured him,
he lost control,

19:40.380 --> 19:43.147
so they saw you fighting.

19:43.149 --> 19:46.150
- And now, he has
recovered enough

19:46.152 --> 19:48.152
to shield himself from you

19:48.154 --> 19:50.188
once again.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.026
What do you want?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.464
- They want to make
an alliance with you.

20:00.466 --> 20:04.802
Sometimes great enemies
become allies,

20:04.804 --> 20:06.737
so they can fight
a common foe.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.673
- Do they know how

20:08.675 --> 20:11.075
to kill him?

20:11.077 --> 20:13.211
- I think, for obvious reasons,

20:13.213 --> 20:15.346
they won't answer that question.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.482
- Then I don't see
how they can help me.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.751
- No.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.187
You're here to help them.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.189
Over the millennia,
they have gathered

20:25.191 --> 20:27.658
vast resources that could
help you in your hunt.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.761
- A legend has passed down

20:30.763 --> 20:33.364
through the centuries...

20:33.366 --> 20:36.267
concerning a book,

20:36.269 --> 20:39.070
an ancient tome

20:39.072 --> 20:41.706
of uncertain provenance

20:41.708 --> 20:44.275
and some say divine inspiration:

20:44.277 --> 20:47.345
the<i> Occido Lumen.</i>

20:47.347 --> 20:50.281
(Ancients growling)

20:51.918 --> 20:54.051
- And, uh...

20:54.053 --> 20:56.787
what do you know
of this book?

20:56.789 --> 20:59.724
- I now have proof
that it exists.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.260
(weird bark)

21:05.365 --> 21:07.732
What are they saying?

21:07.734 --> 21:11.135
- They're trying to decide
whether you should live.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.971
- I vowed to hunt the Master

21:13.973 --> 21:16.374
until the day I die.

21:16.376 --> 21:20.211
If today is that day, so be it!

21:20.213 --> 21:22.280
(Ancient growling)

21:22.282 --> 21:25.316
- All right.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.752
Here's the bargain.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.754
They'll let you live,

21:29.756 --> 21:32.223
but you must guarantee

21:32.225 --> 21:34.625
that when you find the Master,
you will alert us.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.497
- Fair enough.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.399
(Ancient growling)

21:41.401 --> 21:43.067
- Oh?

21:43.069 --> 21:47.004
They're waking now, yeah.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.073
We'd best leave.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.742
They're gonna be hungry.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.178
(man grunting)

21:57.750 --> 22:01.152
No! Please!

22:08.995 --> 22:12.763
(naked man grunting and panting)

22:12.765 --> 22:15.533
(Ancient grumbling)

22:15.535 --> 22:17.601
(chain rattling)

22:17.603 --> 22:19.337
Ah!

22:25.545 --> 22:28.612
(naked man screaming)

22:47.133 --> 22:50.868
(naked man screaming)

22:55.641 --> 22:58.309
- As you walk on
in the daylight...

23:00.880 --> 23:03.314
...never forget this.

23:03.316 --> 23:05.716
(Ancients grunting)

23:19.198 --> 23:20.965
¶¶
(distant indistinct yelling)

23:20.966 --> 23:22.733
,

23:41.854 --> 23:43.788
/             ¶¶
(distant indistinct yelling)
(door closing)

23:51.364 --> 23:53.931
- (Nora): Hello?

23:53.933 --> 23:57.134
Anybody there?

23:58.704 --> 24:00.805
No looters.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.541
- Well, if a Walmart is a 10

24:03.543 --> 24:06.043
on the
attractiveness-to-looters scale,

24:06.045 --> 24:08.479
then the pathology lab
would be like a negative 3.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.150
- I wonder what happened
to Elliot.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.387
- He was smart enough to start
a chain of 10 pathology labs;

24:16.389 --> 24:18.756
probably smart enough
to get out of the city.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.058
Smarter than us anyway.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.060
- God bless the man.

24:23.062 --> 24:27.231
Never skimped on anything.
(Eph sighs.)

24:27.233 --> 24:29.433
- You know, it doesn't make
any sense to haul all this

24:29.435 --> 24:31.435
back to Fet's;
we should just set up shop here.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.270
- Yeah.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.773
Thank you, El, wherever you are.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.575
(roaring)
- (Eph): Jesus Christ!

24:37.577 --> 24:38.909
- Ah!
- Ugh!

24:38.911 --> 24:40.744
(screaming)

24:40.746 --> 24:43.247
(glass breaking)
(roaring)

24:43.249 --> 24:46.250
(screaming)

24:46.252 --> 24:48.085
(low croaking)

24:53.526 --> 24:56.660
(vampire croaking)

25:00.266 --> 25:01.665
(gasp)

25:03.803 --> 25:05.836
- Poor Elliot.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.784
-<i> Herr Eichhorst.</i>

25:20.786 --> 25:22.786
Where is he?

25:22.788 --> 25:24.955
- He's near...

25:24.957 --> 25:26.957
always near.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.959
- I was under
the clear impression

25:28.961 --> 25:31.629
that he was going
to be here!

25:31.631 --> 25:34.565
- The Master will attend or

25:34.567 --> 25:37.668
will not attend, according to--
- Please!

25:37.670 --> 25:40.971
Spare me the "he will
or he will not" spiel.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.706
It's tiresome.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.808
This is the most
significant part

25:44.810 --> 25:46.977
of the next phase
of operations!

25:46.979 --> 25:50.548
Now, where is he?

25:52.585 --> 25:56.353
- I see a little of
the Master's white in your veins

25:56.355 --> 25:58.656
has made you bold, Eldritch.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.691
But as a friend,

26:00.693 --> 26:04.361
I'm telling you, being too bold

26:04.363 --> 26:07.197
may not be wise right now.
(Eldritch laughing)

26:07.199 --> 26:09.833
- Eichhorst, honestly?

26:09.835 --> 26:11.835
You're not my friend,

26:11.837 --> 26:16.006
and I don't give a warm shit
what you think.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.342
Don't try and manage me.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.579
I'm not one
of your foot soldiers.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.181
I am the Master's partner.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.453
- His partner...
- Hmm...

26:31.190 --> 26:34.191
- Of course.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.860
The Master will be
very interested

26:36.862 --> 26:38.929
to hear that.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.867
- That's a burn.

26:43.869 --> 26:47.037
Only silver could do that.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.373
Did someone attack you?

26:49.375 --> 26:52.242
- Step away.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.244
- Who was it?

26:54.246 --> 26:58.382
Setrakian and his merry band
of vampire hunters?

26:58.384 --> 27:01.952
The ones you deemed
were not a threat? Hm?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.921
(generator sound)

27:03.923 --> 27:06.190
- Where is
your faith, Eldritch?

27:08.127 --> 27:12.062
If you only knew
what was to come.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.632
- And what does that mean?

27:19.338 --> 27:22.406
- Mr. Palmer, sir.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.609
I'm Coco Marchand.
I work with Jack Parker.

27:25.611 --> 27:28.746
I'm, I'm sorry I'm late -
it was challenging to get here.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.181
- Where's Mr. Parker?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.684
- With all the craziness,
he had a family emergency.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.653
But I'm a licensed broker,
and I know, from working

27:35.655 --> 27:39.256
with Mr. Parker,
how important this deal is.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.525
So, I jumped at the chance
to work with you.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.261
Anyway, I have
all the paperwork right here.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.597
Hello. I'm Coco Marchand.

27:46.599 --> 27:48.766
- Thomas Eichhorst.
Very pleased.

27:48.768 --> 27:52.436
- Mr. Eichhorst is
my business associate.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.638
I had expressed my concern

27:54.640 --> 27:57.374
to Mr. Parker
about the property's

27:57.376 --> 27:59.643
EPA status.
- Yes.

27:59.645 --> 28:03.480
I managed to locate
the EPA 3842 form

28:03.482 --> 28:06.550
on the property. Zero issues.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.619
- Very well done!

28:08.621 --> 28:11.655
- The drains...
they're all functional?

28:11.657 --> 28:14.958
Can they carry a large amount
of liquid waste?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.960
- Well, this was a soap
and cleaning supply factory.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.662
I imagine so.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.964
- What if we were
to significantly modify

28:20.966 --> 28:23.834
the property?
- It's zoned IR4,

28:23.836 --> 28:26.804
which means you can pretty much
do anything you want here,

28:26.806 --> 28:29.473
except build a baseball stadium
and compete with the Yankees.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.741
(Palmer chuckles.)

28:30.743 --> 28:33.010
- You a sports fan,
Miss Marchand?

28:33.012 --> 28:36.647
- I'm a Red Sox fan, yeah.
- Really?

28:36.649 --> 28:38.515
Where did you grow up?

28:38.517 --> 28:41.185
- In France. My mother's French,
my father's American -

28:41.187 --> 28:43.487
from Boston.

28:45.091 --> 28:48.192
- I've never been
to a baseball game.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.160
- You're kidding me?

28:50.162 --> 28:52.096
- Health issues,

28:52.098 --> 28:55.032
the distractions
of my career...

28:55.034 --> 28:58.669
No, sadly,
I have never gone.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.704
- Oh, you must go.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.373
Baseball can make you feel
like a little boy again,

29:03.375 --> 29:06.844
in the best possible way.
- Can we finish our business?

29:06.846 --> 29:09.613
- Here, I brought you
the purchase agreement.

29:16.689 --> 29:19.022
- Tell them that in -
thank you -

29:19.024 --> 29:22.092
in the middle
of this medical holocaust,

29:22.094 --> 29:25.028
they're the luckiest
real estate sellers

29:25.030 --> 29:28.532
in the city.
Give them exactly 12 hours.

29:28.534 --> 29:31.735
I'm not moving
on the price...

29:31.737 --> 29:33.370
except down.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.639
- Yes, sir.
I'll get you an answer.

29:35.641 --> 29:39.143
- No, Miss Marchand,
get me the property.

30:01.267 --> 30:05.235
- We either interrupt
the chain of infection here...

30:05.237 --> 30:07.604
by developing a vaccine

30:07.606 --> 30:09.973
or we pour our efforts

30:09.975 --> 30:13.010
into a cure here.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.512
- Or we find a way
to get to the Bahamas.

30:15.514 --> 30:19.516
I love the chart, it's awesome.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.419
And I don't want to get
too meta about it,

30:22.421 --> 30:24.621
but I keep looking at it
and I think:

30:24.623 --> 30:26.757
this is a summary
of our entire careers:

30:26.759 --> 30:29.126
how everything we know
is now useless.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.929
Right, let's start
with the vaccine.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.198
Problem number one:

30:34.200 --> 30:37.668
this disease kills its host
before it turns it.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.169
That's kind of a big problem

30:39.171 --> 30:40.871
if you're trying
to create a vaccine.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.873
It's really a lot easier
if you have a living person.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.042
Problem two - also an issue -

30:45.044 --> 30:47.144
a vaccine helps
create antibodies.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.546
Antibodies travel via
the bloodstream. So you need

30:49.548 --> 30:52.282
a bloodstream.
- What if we find some mechanism

30:52.284 --> 30:54.818
by which we can get
the body to destroy

30:54.820 --> 30:56.787
or reject the worms?

30:56.789 --> 30:59.389
- Cases like Jim's,
where they only get nicked,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.291
that's 10, 20 percent
of the total;

31:01.293 --> 31:03.360
everybody else is getting
sucked dry like a juice box.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.896
- So we focus on a cure?
- Sure!

31:05.898 --> 31:07.831
All we have to do
is figure out

31:07.833 --> 31:09.833
how to create wholesale
human organ regeneration.

31:09.835 --> 31:13.704
- These creatures generate
new organs in a matter of hours.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.906
(Nora sighs.)
Maybe we can start

31:15.908 --> 31:17.975
by figuring out
how they do it.

31:22.815 --> 31:25.716
- Yeah, maybe.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.069
What? Say it.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.843
- I'm not gonna be your scold.
- I only quit drinking

31:52.845 --> 31:55.045
because of Kelly and the whole
custody thing, and I can't think

31:55.047 --> 31:58.282
of a single positive thing
I ever got out of it.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.350
Be honest, even you
like me better when I drink.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.887
(Nora chuckles.)
It's not PC but it's the truth.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.856
- Then you shouldn't feel
the need to justify it.

32:05.858 --> 32:09.526
- I don't.
You're being presumptuous.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.095
- We spent the whole bloody day
fortifying this place

32:12.097 --> 32:14.364
against vampires, and now
you want to set out after dark?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.300
- Setrakian's still gone?

32:16.302 --> 32:18.435
- He doesn't know
the neighborhood.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.904
I... I can't wait
for him any longer.

32:20.906 --> 32:23.874
- The man's a bloody
sword-wielding Armenian samurai.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.876
I'm sure he's--
(knocking on the door)

32:25.878 --> 32:27.144
...fine.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.586
(people yelling outside)

32:36.588 --> 32:38.588
- Thank you.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.658
- Where the hell
were you all day?

32:41.660 --> 32:45.162
- Don't concern yourself
with me.

32:45.164 --> 32:48.165
- Did you think that maybe,
"Gee, uh, I should check in,

32:48.167 --> 32:50.934
let them know that I'm not dead,
let 'em know I'm not a vampire"?

32:50.936 --> 32:53.503
- I'm not dead.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.173
I'm not a vampire.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.486
- Hey.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.356
Professor.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.527
Did you eat anything?
- I'm not hungry.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.263
- No, you gotta eat.

33:20.265 --> 33:23.266
You gotta stay healthy
and sharp.

33:23.268 --> 33:26.203
I'm gonna get you something.

33:28.273 --> 33:30.140
You're not even
gonna growl at me?

33:30.142 --> 33:32.509
- I'm fine.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.913
- Where were you all day?

33:38.650 --> 33:41.785
- On the trail of the Master.

33:41.787 --> 33:45.122
- And?

33:45.124 --> 33:47.224
- Nothing.

33:49.161 --> 33:52.696
(Setrakian sighs.)

33:52.698 --> 33:56.400
Mr. Fet, I need your help.

33:56.402 --> 34:00.370
I have a storage locker...

34:00.372 --> 34:03.340
in it are all my extra supplies.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.642
I, uh, kept them separate

34:05.644 --> 34:09.646
for just this type
of an emergency.

34:09.648 --> 34:13.150
I need to retrieve them.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.852
- Yeah, OK.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.522
- We leave
first thing in the morning.

34:18.524 --> 34:21.658
- See, that's...
that's a good sign:

34:21.660 --> 34:23.827
you giving me orders.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.337
You hurt him, you know?

34:34.339 --> 34:36.339
The Master,

34:36.341 --> 34:39.543
you wounded him.

34:39.545 --> 34:43.113
You shouldn't feel
like you failed.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.863
- Newton's third law states
that for every action

34:59.865 --> 35:04.401
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.937
Write carefully.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.906
Newton's third law states

35:09.908 --> 35:12.609
that for every action

35:12.611 --> 35:16.813
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.116
- Children, close your work

35:19.118 --> 35:21.885
and listen to me for one minute.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.920
Given everything
that's going on,

35:23.922 --> 35:26.556
we have decided
to relocate the institute

35:26.558 --> 35:28.725
to outside of the city.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.760
Now, the National Guard
is in the process

35:30.762 --> 35:33.396
of setting up checkpoints
at all of the bridges

35:33.398 --> 35:35.599
and all of the tunnels
leading out of the city,

35:35.601 --> 35:38.001
but thanks
to our generous sponsors

35:38.003 --> 35:40.003
at the Stoneheart Foundation,

35:40.005 --> 35:42.839
we've gotten a transit pass
out of Manhattan.

35:42.841 --> 35:46.910
So, those of you whose parents
we've managed to contact,

35:46.912 --> 35:49.079
you will be picked up
here at the school.

35:49.081 --> 35:52.015
The rest of the group will
travel with me on the bus

35:52.017 --> 35:54.417
to our new location
in New Jersey.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.953
All right, everyone,
empty your lockers

35:56.955 --> 35:59.256
and pack your bag.
We are leaving in two hours.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.058
(children chatting)

36:14.606 --> 36:17.774
- Jesus Christ, Zack!
What are you doing?!

36:17.776 --> 36:20.277
- I'm practicing.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.279
- You're mad?

36:22.281 --> 36:24.548
Let's talk it out. OK?

36:24.550 --> 36:26.550
You can yell,
you can scream, whatever,

36:26.552 --> 36:28.618
but let's deal with this.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.966
She's gone.

36:42.968 --> 36:46.303
- She's not gone!
She was right there!

36:46.305 --> 36:48.738
You scared her away!
You shot her!

36:48.740 --> 36:51.808
- She's turned. Do you
understand how that works?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.744
- She's sick!
You even said so!

36:56.815 --> 36:59.082
- Her heart...

36:59.084 --> 37:02.252
her organs...

37:02.254 --> 37:04.821
they're all gone.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.890
There's nothing

37:06.892 --> 37:09.259
I can do to help her.

37:09.261 --> 37:13.096
There's nothing anybody
can do to help her.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.098
She's something else now.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.600
- Bullshit!

37:16.602 --> 37:19.202
You're a doctor,
right, Dad?

37:19.204 --> 37:22.439
Then save her! Find a cure!

37:41.793 --> 37:44.361
- You know, drinking alone
is like dancing alone.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.073
(pouring drink)

37:57.075 --> 37:59.576
(putting drink on table)

37:59.578 --> 38:02.379
(pouring second drink)

38:04.216 --> 38:07.651
- To... survival?

38:07.653 --> 38:10.020
- To victory.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.327
What the hell is this?

38:17.329 --> 38:18.995
- I won't know really
until it's finished.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.563
- Well, how will you know
when you're finished?

38:20.565 --> 38:22.932
- When I know
what the hell it is.

38:22.934 --> 38:26.436
- That's a Zen riddle.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.739
Too bad my job
is so results-oriented.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.308
- You still have a job?

38:31.310 --> 38:32.842
- Oh, yeah.
Saving the human race.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.911
- Oh, right. I forgot.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.080
- Ah, "presumptuous:

38:37.082 --> 38:39.516
"failing to observe
the limits

38:39.518 --> 38:42.752
of what is permitted
or appropriate."

38:42.754 --> 38:45.121
- I really got under your skin
with that remark, didn't I?

38:45.123 --> 38:47.857
- "Impertinent. Bold.

38:47.859 --> 38:51.294
Confident."
- Arrogant.

38:51.296 --> 38:53.663
Egotistical. Cheeky.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.468
- I forget, are we talking
about you or me?

38:58.470 --> 39:01.604
All right, so tell me,

39:01.606 --> 39:03.773
which is more fun?

39:03.775 --> 39:06.876
Crashing the Internet
or making this thing?

39:06.878 --> 39:09.379
- Art rarely goes viral,

39:09.381 --> 39:12.449
but dark deeds
seem to be contagious.

39:17.322 --> 39:19.489
- You're absolutely right.
Thank you.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.224
- For what?

39:21.226 --> 39:23.126
- The drink.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.998
- Nutter.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.183
¶¶

39:30.184 --> 39:31.367
,

39:51.323 --> 39:55.592
/
- Excuse me. Are we
at the quarantine zone?

39:55.594 --> 39:59.496
I didn't hear us
go over a bridge,

39:59.498 --> 40:03.266
or through a tunnel.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.236
OK, everyone.

40:06.238 --> 40:08.037
Grab your seatmate's hands,

40:08.039 --> 40:11.241
we're gonna get off the bus
and gather just outside.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.879
I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'm sure we could all use

40:15.881 --> 40:18.081
a trip to the restroom,

40:18.083 --> 40:20.683
and some food.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.189
- (woman): Stand with me.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.959
- (girl): Miss Sanger?

40:29.961 --> 40:32.695
- I... I know, Meghan.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.898
You're the last, right?
- I think so.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.401
- OK, come on.
I'll be your buddy.

40:38.403 --> 40:42.539
- (Eichhorst):
Welcome, children!

40:42.541 --> 40:45.975
- Hello? Who's there?

40:45.977 --> 40:48.745
- How wonderful that
you have all arrived

40:48.747 --> 40:50.713
with your teacher.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.783
Miss Sanger,

40:53.785 --> 40:56.886
are all these children
blind from birth?

40:56.888 --> 40:59.055
- Some of them are, yes,

40:59.057 --> 41:01.925
but not all of them. Uh...

41:01.927 --> 41:05.228
are we... Is this
the new school?

41:05.230 --> 41:08.331
- Your journey has indeed
come to an end,

41:08.333 --> 41:11.534
but your adventure
is just beginning.

41:19.511 --> 41:23.246
- So, finding a cure or making
a vaccine is nearly impossible.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.949
But what we can do
is take everything we know

41:25.951 --> 41:27.951
about how to stop an epidemic

41:27.953 --> 41:31.120
and use that knowledge
to start one.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.356
- Infect the infected.
- Find a weak link

41:33.358 --> 41:37.193
in the vampire biology and
cook something up to exploit it.

41:37.195 --> 41:40.463
Infect the carriers,

41:40.465 --> 41:42.365
break the chain.

41:42.367 --> 41:45.101
- We need something we can
distribute on a mass scale.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.638
- Something that vampires
are vulnerable to,

41:48.640 --> 41:51.975
but that non-turned humans
can tolerate.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.944
- The elevated body temperature.
The stinger morphology.

41:54.946 --> 41:58.114
- Something to attack
the simplistic brain stem?

41:58.116 --> 42:01.618
The biological and chemical
components, that's more

42:01.620 --> 42:03.520
your department.
- If we can brew up

42:03.522 --> 42:05.655
something that will burn
through these things

42:05.657 --> 42:07.991
fast but not too fast,
with enough incubation time

42:07.993 --> 42:10.059
to spread the disease
to other vampires, then--

42:10.061 --> 42:12.896
- Perhaps you two
can be useful after all.

42:12.898 --> 42:15.331
- I'm glad you approve.

42:15.333 --> 42:18.468
- But first, I, uh...

42:18.470 --> 42:21.204
I must ask you to help me
with something.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.976
- Fellow New Yorkers,
the federal government

42:26.978 --> 42:29.679
says it's doing all it can
to help our great city,

42:29.681 --> 42:31.814
but if you're like me,

42:31.816 --> 42:34.350
you have a hard time
seeing much evidence of that.

42:34.352 --> 42:36.352
This morning,

42:36.354 --> 42:39.589
I informed Mayor Lyle that I am
making available to the city

42:39.591 --> 42:41.591
an open line of credit

42:41.593 --> 42:43.760
to supplement
the emergency budget,

42:43.762 --> 42:46.529
effective immediately.
(applause)

42:46.531 --> 42:48.531
- Thank you, sir.

42:48.533 --> 42:51.901
(indistinct comments)

42:51.903 --> 42:55.672
Mr. Palmer and I
have never been on the same side

42:55.674 --> 42:59.208
of any political issue,
but a true statesman

42:59.210 --> 43:01.678
sets aside political rhetoric

43:01.680 --> 43:04.347
in a time of crisis.
- Mayor.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.185
Let me be perfectly clear.
This credit line

43:09.187 --> 43:12.021
is an investment
in the future of this city

43:12.023 --> 43:14.624
<i> and the resilience</i>
<i> of its brave citizens.</i>

43:14.626 --> 43:17.226
<i> I am calling upon everyone</i>
<i> to be vigilant</i>

43:17.228 --> 43:19.362
<i> and to look out</i>
<i> for family, friends,</i>

43:19.364 --> 43:21.531
<i> and neighbors</i>
<i> in this time of crisis,</i>

43:21.533 --> 43:24.267
and show our country,
and indeed the world,

43:24.269 --> 43:26.536
what New York is made of.

43:26.538 --> 43:29.973
Thank you all for coming.
(applause)

43:29.975 --> 43:31.941
(reporters chattering)
- (man): Mr. Palmer! Mr. Palmer!

43:34.713 --> 43:37.447
- Ms. Marchand. Good news?

43:37.449 --> 43:39.649
- Your offer was accepted.

43:39.651 --> 43:41.651
And I have to say,

43:41.653 --> 43:44.554
what you're doing
for this city, it's heroic.

43:44.556 --> 43:47.624
- Oh... "To whom
much is given..."

43:47.626 --> 43:48.791
- Oh, I don't believe
anyone ever

43:48.793 --> 43:50.326
gave you anything, Mr. Palmer.

43:50.328 --> 43:54.097
But you need a better tie.
This one is boring.

43:54.099 --> 43:55.565
- Boring?
- Mm-hmm.

43:55.567 --> 43:58.167
- I have a hundred
just like it.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.772
Miss Marchand...

44:02.774 --> 44:04.774
how would you like
to work for me?

44:04.776 --> 44:06.576
- Pardon me?

44:06.578 --> 44:08.611
- Not for Stoneheart.
Directly for me.

44:08.613 --> 44:12.081
- Why, thank you, Mr. Palmer,
but I don't think

44:12.083 --> 44:14.751
I can.
- You feel a sense of loyalty

44:14.753 --> 44:16.753
to your current employer.
- The firm paid

44:16.755 --> 44:18.755
for all my training
and licensing,

44:18.757 --> 44:20.957
and I have only been
with them for 18 months.

44:20.959 --> 44:25.261
- Yes, yes, that was
very generous of them.

44:25.263 --> 44:27.930
Here's what I want you to do:

44:27.932 --> 44:30.767
go back to your office
and tell 'em Mr....

44:30.769 --> 44:33.936
- Parker.
- Parker. I offered to double...

44:33.938 --> 44:36.606
No, triple your salary

44:36.608 --> 44:39.942
and give you a position
working directly with me.

44:39.944 --> 44:42.145
I promise you,
he won't be angry.

44:42.147 --> 44:45.114
He'll be falling all over
himself to retain you

44:45.116 --> 44:46.783
as a contact.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.718
How does that sound?

44:48.720 --> 44:51.220
(She sighs.)

44:53.124 --> 44:55.158
- (man):<i> Let me ask.</i>

44:55.160 --> 44:57.126
- (second man):<i> Been waiting</i>
<i> all night... I'm sure.</i>

44:57.128 --> 45:00.129
- (man):<i> Is there any doubt,</i>
<i> any at all, that the CDC's</i>

45:00.131 --> 45:03.833
<i> response to this epidemic</i>
<i> has not been a total failure?</i>

45:03.835 --> 45:06.102
(interview continuing
indistinctly)

45:08.139 --> 45:10.573
- Hungry?
- You went shopping?

45:10.575 --> 45:13.242
- Sort of...

45:13.244 --> 45:15.712
- You stole it?
- Which is the greater sin?

45:15.714 --> 45:17.847
Stealing food or wasting it?

45:17.849 --> 45:20.850
My stomach said wasting.

45:20.852 --> 45:23.486
Ever had ramen noodles?

45:23.488 --> 45:26.856
I lived off this stuff
exclusively for three years.

45:26.858 --> 45:29.659
Ramen and Red Bull.

45:29.661 --> 45:32.595
Oh, here. I got you this.

45:38.937 --> 45:41.437
- It's warm.
- We're in the middle

45:41.439 --> 45:44.507
of a vampire apocalypse;
everybody's making sacrifices.

45:50.715 --> 45:53.382
Anything good on TV?

45:53.384 --> 45:58.855
- Just the same news
over and over.

46:08.233 --> 46:10.733
Is this gonna keep them out?

46:10.735 --> 46:13.202
- You bet your ass it will.

46:16.708 --> 46:18.708
(vampires growling)

46:42.934 --> 46:44.801
- Rise.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.461
You are very lucky indeed.

47:12.463 --> 47:15.198
Our Lord is going
to give you back

47:15.200 --> 47:18.467
the power of your own thought,

47:18.469 --> 47:21.437
your own voice.

47:21.439 --> 47:24.574
You have been chosen.

47:26.978 --> 47:29.078
(soft croaking)

47:33.384 --> 47:35.384
- Zack.

47:35.386 --> 47:37.653
- Ahhh...

47:37.655 --> 47:41.490
there. You talk.

47:41.492 --> 47:44.794
It has begun.

47:47.498 --> 47:49.866
Come.

48:05.483 --> 48:08.117
(siren blaring)

48:31.042 --> 48:35.378
- (Eph): This place is a maze.
Where is it?

48:35.380 --> 48:37.780
- It's, uh, here.

48:37.782 --> 48:39.515
- (Eph): You don't remember
which unit?

48:39.517 --> 48:43.452
- Of course I do.
By sight, not by number.

48:59.904 --> 49:02.038
Here. This is the one.

49:03.875 --> 49:05.641
- Are you sure?

49:05.643 --> 49:08.044
- Or, uh...

49:08.046 --> 49:10.446
this one.
It's one of these two.

49:15.153 --> 49:17.153
- You have no keys?

49:17.155 --> 49:19.956
- No, he left them back
at the pawnshop.

49:19.958 --> 49:23.492
No harm.

49:28.266 --> 49:30.166
- Not exactly the weapons
I was expecting.

49:34.005 --> 49:36.105
- Dammit!
Then it's the other one.

49:36.107 --> 49:39.675
(distant thud)
(metal object rattling)

50:11.876 --> 50:14.310
- OK. OK.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.645
Don't shoot!

50:16.647 --> 50:19.215
Don't shoot!

50:21.986 --> 50:24.387
The government's lying -
they're doing nothing.

50:24.389 --> 50:27.123
Our building? The people
who lived there

50:27.125 --> 50:29.492
have either been turned into one
of those creatures or they fled.

50:29.494 --> 50:31.994
- I'm gonna check out
the next corridor.

50:31.996 --> 50:34.130
- This seemed
as safe a place as any.

50:34.132 --> 50:36.499
- So we stored ourselves.

50:36.501 --> 50:38.501
- Do you have any family?

50:38.503 --> 50:42.405
- A son. He's disabled.

50:42.407 --> 50:45.074
- He's well cared for.

50:45.076 --> 50:48.811
- We can find more silver.
We can make new weapons.

50:48.813 --> 50:51.347
Let's go!

50:51.349 --> 50:53.783
- Here, this is it.

50:58.189 --> 51:01.157
- (Eph): What do you want
so badly in there?

51:04.362 --> 51:08.230
- Yeah, this is definitely
the one.

51:19.010 --> 51:20.609
What's this?

51:20.611 --> 51:22.611
- Silver grenades.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.880
Please handle them
with care. I was not able

51:24.882 --> 51:27.550
to make them too stable.

51:27.552 --> 51:31.020
- Dangerous explosives:
your favorite. You carry those.

51:40.364 --> 51:42.965
What's that?
- Some notebooks,

51:42.967 --> 51:46.368
some research I need to review.

51:46.370 --> 51:48.804
I, uh, made a mistake.

51:48.806 --> 51:52.041
It won't happen again.

51:53.911 --> 51:57.313
- We found it! They're
loading up the truck right now!

51:57.315 --> 52:00.249
- Why don't you come with us?
- No, thank you.

52:00.251 --> 52:02.585
- It's not safe,

52:02.587 --> 52:05.488
nowhere is, but there is
safety in numbers.

52:05.490 --> 52:08.157
- Nora...
- (man): We're fine here, OK?

52:09.927 --> 52:13.095
- (Eph): Godammit!

52:13.097 --> 52:15.131
Oh no, Fet, I'm done...
- (Nora): Just think about it.

52:15.133 --> 52:19.001
- (Eph): ...chasing
the old man around.

52:26.010 --> 52:28.310
(vampires growling)

52:29.914 --> 52:31.947
(screaming)

52:31.949 --> 52:33.582
- NORA!

52:33.584 --> 52:36.619
(gunshot)
- Go! Go!

52:36.621 --> 52:40.256
Go!
(vampires screaming, growling)

52:51.469 --> 52:55.037
(vampires growling, screaming)
(gunshots)

52:56.974 --> 53:00.876
(vampire screaming)
(Fet grunting)

53:02.813 --> 53:04.847
- Oh...
(vampires growling)

53:07.652 --> 53:10.553
(vampire screaming)

53:10.555 --> 53:11.787
Huh?

53:21.632 --> 53:24.066
(vampires screaming)
(gunshots)

53:42.353 --> 53:44.920
- (old woman): Oh! Ah!
- (Nora): Go to the truck!

53:52.096 --> 53:53.162
(click)

54:01.272 --> 54:03.339
- (Nora): Come on! Come on!
(vampire screaming)

54:06.043 --> 54:07.776
- (balding man): No! No!

54:12.283 --> 54:15.384
- (Nora): Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

54:15.386 --> 54:18.287
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.
-Show me.

54:23.894 --> 54:24.026
¶¶

54:31.235 --> 54:34.370
)
- No, wait, wait!

54:34.372 --> 54:36.639
We need them.

54:54.925 --> 54:57.226
- We're all called upon

54:57.228 --> 54:59.762
to serve his glory...

54:59.764 --> 55:03.399
but the Master has anointed you
above the others.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.936
This is a great honor

55:07.938 --> 55:11.340
and an even greater
responsibility.

55:11.342 --> 55:14.910
(soft growling sounds)
All due to your connection

55:14.912 --> 55:17.746
with your dear one.

55:19.583 --> 55:22.418
- Zack.
- Yes, him.

55:22.420 --> 55:24.920
Rejoice, Kelly...

55:26.924 --> 55:31.927
...for you have
an important role to play

55:31.929 --> 55:34.129
in the Master's great vision.

55:34.131 --> 55:36.598
To that end,

55:36.600 --> 55:38.801
he has bestowed
upon you the blessing

55:38.803 --> 55:41.437
of a new family.
(soft growling sounds)

55:43.307 --> 55:46.508
They have unique abilities -

55:46.510 --> 55:50.879
sight and perception
beyond the visible spectrum.

55:52.550 --> 55:55.317
Behold the Feelers,

55:55.319 --> 55:58.554
the children of the night.

55:58.556 --> 56:02.725
(soft growling)

56:13.304 --> 56:16.905
(soft growling)

56:22.012 --> 56:25.914
(Feelers clicking)

56:40.998 --> 56:42.998
