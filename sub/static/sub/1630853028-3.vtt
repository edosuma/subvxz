WEBVTT

00:07.883 --> 00:09.802
You're gonna love
my new place.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.388
I got a sweet deal because
the previous occupant died

00:12.471 --> 00:14.140
and no one found him
till he liquefied.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.726
Mm. Can we talk
about my interview?

00:16.809 --> 00:19.353
Because my résumé says I have
experience in game design.

00:19.437 --> 00:21.647
Yeah, I know. I wrote it.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.399
Yeah, but Horizen knows

00:23.482 --> 00:25.484
I only have experience
in customer service.

00:25.568 --> 00:26.569
So how am I supposed to fake...

00:26.652 --> 00:28.779
Shorty, you're
not gonna get the job.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.156
Don't call me that.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.782
We're just trying
to get you on the IT floor

00:31.866 --> 00:33.784
so you can drop
a few Ring Drives around.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.786
Somebody picks one up,
plugs it in,

00:35.870 --> 00:37.371
we get access.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.123
Easy peasy.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.295
I think I'd be good at design.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.005
Chillax. Oh, my God.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.257
You want me to lower the seats
into sleep mode?

00:49.842 --> 00:52.595
- Oh, God. God, no.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.105
It's gonna be hard to chillax
like this.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.449
It was
a crazy party, Mom.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.075
Yeah, everyone's food
was totally customized.

01:15.159 --> 01:17.745
David Choak gets off
on eating exotic things,

01:17.828 --> 01:19.747
and his dessert was some fruit

01:19.830 --> 01:21.457
that went extinct
with the dinosaurs.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.001
But... Mom, enough about me.
How are you doing?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.003
Well...

01:26.086 --> 01:28.464
the rent was due again
and I didn't have it.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.465
Oh, God.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.550
Listen to me, I'm sorry, Mom.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.511
- I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.722
Well, should I talk to Ingrid
about a loan?

01:36.806 --> 01:40.559
No. Can we not have this
conversation in front of...?

01:42.019 --> 01:44.271
Oh. Uh, yeah.
She's not paying attention.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.982
I never really got it until we
started living together, but...

01:47.066 --> 01:48.818
she just kind of zones out
a lot.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.778
You are
coming down with a UTI.

01:50.861 --> 01:54.114
Hug Suit suggested usage
is maximum six hours daily.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.784
Okay, Mom. Don't lecture me.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.786
You're a toilet.
Okay? You're...

01:58.869 --> 02:00.412
You're a fucking toilet.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.331
The lowest of the low.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.041
I'd send you money, Mom, but...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.377
I still can't work here.
It's illegal.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.921
- I have an idea for your mom.

02:09.922 --> 02:13.008
The gig economy.

02:13.092 --> 02:16.095
Yeah. Errand Hamsters
or Job Gerbils

02:16.178 --> 02:19.139
make two percent on orders,
plus tips, sometimes.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.684
Tip-Tips all the time. Right?

02:21.767 --> 02:24.854
No. Yeah, of course.
For exceptional service.

02:24.937 --> 02:28.190
What does a Job Gerbil do
exactly?

02:28.274 --> 02:29.942
Uh, pick stuff up
and bring it to you.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.151
Like a golden retriever?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.653
Golden Retriever? Uh...

02:32.736 --> 02:34.738
Oof. Viv.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.157
I doubt that you could get hired
by Golden Retriever.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.702
They are very selective.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.662
Start with Gerbil.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.123
My mom's flat broke.
She could lose the apartment.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.375
- Crab legs.
- Ooh. Yes, please.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.794
Kannerman owes me money for my
code, but if I ask him for it,

02:48.878 --> 02:50.880
- he'll know
I got my memories back.
- Mm.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.464
I made a deal with the devil.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.425
- Can't even get paid.
- Yeah.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.010
Wish I could help, man.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.553
I'm broke, too.
My Purple Heart Grant

02:57.636 --> 02:59.305
only covers room and board.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.807
We need to make some money.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.267
Tell me about it.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.353
Can't even sell our blood
down here.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.106
What's up, Yang?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.191
Never noticed these little
windows in 2Gigs before.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.484
Oh, they're new.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.320
We're supposed to drool
at the luxuries

03:14.403 --> 03:15.946
and get our relatives
to upgrade us.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.282
That's cruel. Here.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.534
Have an éclair.

03:20.618 --> 03:21.869
Oh.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.205
- Ow!
- Thanks for trying.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.750
I just wanted a peek
before my data ran out.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.293
Wake me up when Freeyond opens,
right?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.794
That's so unfair.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.005
You're gonna be stored
on a backup drive

03:33.088 --> 03:34.632
while these guys sit around
with more data

03:34.715 --> 03:36.300
than they could use
in a lifetime?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.968
Hey, waiter.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.721
I've had Indian,
green and Congo.

03:40.804 --> 03:41.805
I need the next peacock.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.015
I'm sorry, sir,

03:43.098 --> 03:45.643
but you've already tried
every type of peacock.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.810
Well, what's next?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.228
Um...

03:48.312 --> 03:50.189
Bring me a penguin.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.441
P... Penguin it is.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.738
Oh.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.224
Don't use it all in one place.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.308
Thanks, Nathan.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.812
I'm gonna think so hard
with these.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.314
I might even daydream!

04:32.398 --> 04:34.233
Okay.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.653
- That was awesome.
- Yeah, that felt really good.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.446
Steal from the rich,
give to the poor.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.864
That's some Robin Hood shit,
man.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.116
That was my favorite movie
when I was a kid.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.117
Me, too.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.535
If we're gonna do this,

04:44.618 --> 04:46.203
I can't be Friar Tuck.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.330
I had a bowl cut
when I was in second grade,

04:48.414 --> 04:49.957
and I was a little husky.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.375
Kids can be mean.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.127
Oh. Dude.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.720
Okay. Job Gerbil,

05:02.803 --> 05:06.015
you are going to pretend
to be me,

05:06.098 --> 05:08.475
so that I can take a break
from pretending to be dead.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.602
Cove? Aeon? Lakeview?

05:10.686 --> 05:13.105
Lakeview. Obviously.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.149
'Kay, here's everything you need
to know about my boyfriend.

05:15.232 --> 05:18.110
- Your profile said
that you teach kindergarten?
- Mm-hmm.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.111
That might come in handy.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.779
Just try and get him out
of his room

05:20.863 --> 05:23.282
and away from...
Luke What's-His-Name.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.410
Oh. And if you tell on me
or fuck him,

05:26.493 --> 05:30.039
I will know and zero stars will
be the least of your problems.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.249
'Kay? I will ruin your life.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.751
Do you understand?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.795
I mean, others have gotten there
before you, but yeah.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.631
Okay, great.
Any other questions?

05:39.715 --> 05:41.175
Is...

05:41.258 --> 05:42.176
Oh, yeah.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.219
I washed it, twice. Sorry.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.180
Just 'cause your...

05:46.263 --> 05:48.390
Just 'cause the toilet told me
what happened to you and...

05:48.474 --> 05:50.809
- Don't listen
to the fucking toilet.
- Well, it... Okay.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.061
It's a fucking toilet.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.188
You're a fucking toilet!

05:54.271 --> 05:55.647
Ingrid has
a yeast infection.

05:55.731 --> 05:56.899
Proceed with caution.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.484
Shut up.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.740
Home sweet home.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.743
This is exciting.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.120
Never had a female roommate.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.955
Or visitor.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.006
Ivan, what the hell? Why is
your Roomba wearing panties?

06:21.090 --> 06:23.801
Just added
a couple sexbot upgrades.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.594
I don't want to brag, but...

06:25.677 --> 06:27.346
she's six different kinds
of fuckable.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.764
- Huh.
- Nothing hotter

06:28.847 --> 06:30.015
than a French maid, am I right?

06:30.099 --> 06:31.934
Give it to me, papa.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.019
Oh, baby. Stop.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.480
Uh, you know what?
I'm getting a call.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.401
Call Mateo.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.320
I just sent you my location pin.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.489
I may end up killing
Agent Cheeto.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.865
So...

06:46.949 --> 06:48.283
Oh, hey, um,

06:48.367 --> 06:50.369
do you want me to make up
the couch? Or, uh,

06:50.452 --> 06:52.871
my bed is through that door.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.706
Full size bed.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.000
With a lock on the door?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.669
Uh-huh.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.087
Great.

07:05.676 --> 07:06.593
Here's a gig

07:06.677 --> 07:08.595
for you.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.347
And a gig for you.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.932
Where did all this come from?

07:12.015 --> 07:12.933
Nobody knows.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.476
The card said "Robin Hood."

07:16.228 --> 07:18.313
- It's cool to see
all the happy faces, huh?
- Yeah.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.815
Yeah.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.193
Wonder who Robin Hood is though.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.028
Uh, sorry, guys.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.156
I don't have any more.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.407
Well, then...

07:28.490 --> 07:30.409
I'm going to the torrent.

07:32.411 --> 07:33.996
He really should've gone first.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.835
Hi, Detective. Hi.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.629
Can I get you anything?
A-a drink, perhaps?

07:42.713 --> 07:45.507
Oh.
Of course. You're on duty!

07:45.591 --> 07:47.092
Dumb Lucy.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.261
How 'bout a snack?

07:49.344 --> 07:50.345
I'm good.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.681
I'm just...
taking a look around.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.142
Well, you just let me know.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.644
We're all willing to help
in any way.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.688
So... yeah.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.066
I'll just be in my office.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.913
Who's that guy?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.915
He is some kind
of a cybercrimes detective.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.792
Apparently, he has a warrant
to look around.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.587
So that's...
just what he's doing.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.382
Well, it's a good thing
we don't have anything to hide.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.886
That... is...

08:30.969 --> 08:32.930
correct.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.019
Put this in the storeroom
for me, will ya?

08:39.102 --> 08:40.562
Real quick.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.356
Quicker than that.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.650
You got those long legs!
Go ahead and use 'em!

09:01.333 --> 09:03.210
What are you up to?

09:07.589 --> 09:11.510
He's an asshole,
but this is not cool, Lucy.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.180
Cute butt though.

09:17.975 --> 09:21.478
Wonder what would happen
if I put a pimple on it?

09:29.611 --> 09:31.446
Welcome back,
Nora Antony.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.906
Thanks.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.324
Yeah, it's-it's been
a long time...

09:34.408 --> 09:35.742
Next.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.835
Ah, look who is back from
mysterious leave of absence.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.296
I just ran away with a guy.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.422
It didn't work out.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.715
I can relate.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.883
He try to pimp you?

09:55.178 --> 09:56.513
Here you go.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.931
A treat.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.435
So now we're buying coffee
for other bitches?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.061
- What?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.113
Girl, I got so much to tell you.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.364
- Mm?
- You will not believe

10:14.448 --> 10:16.742
- what Lucy has been up to now.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.994
There are videos.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.829
Ooh. Which you will show me.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.205
Okay.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.709
- Who's this?
- Oh. I'm Tinsley.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.085
It's so good
to finally meet you.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.713
- It's, um... It's just been...

10:29.796 --> 10:32.007
Uh, hi?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.052
My temp.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.348
Oh. Man.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.683
So, you're my boss now?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.187
I guess I have to do work.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.773
Yeah.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.982
You do though.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.151
- Okay.
- Aleesha's tough.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.402
But-but fair.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.820
Yeah, I've been learning
so much,

10:53.904 --> 10:55.072
- and it's really great...

10:56.406 --> 10:58.116
So, where the fuck
have you been?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.993
- And how's Byron?
- Oh.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.870
Uh, you know...

11:03.080 --> 11:03.997
He's fine.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.582
Fine?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.000
Fine.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.752
Cool.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.672
Bumblebee, bumblebee.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.427
You can do this.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.598
We got to figure out a way
to steal more data faster.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.974
I mean,
anyone who can afford Lakeview

11:23.058 --> 11:24.726
can afford to share some
with the 2Gigs.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.353
We got to get that guy a dick.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.771
What?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.650
Oh... sugar.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.361
Hi. So I guess
you heard all that. And...

11:34.444 --> 11:36.071
- the thing is...
- Please don't tattle on us.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.989
Yeah. Please don't tattle on us.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.991
Never.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.537
God, I would go to jail
before I ratted somebody out.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.790
My uncle taught me the only
thing you have in this life

11:46.873 --> 11:47.874
is your rep...

11:47.958 --> 11:50.168
And you ruin it by snitching.
So...

11:50.252 --> 11:51.503
This is the uncle I met?

11:51.586 --> 11:53.004
Uh-huh. Yeah.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.589
Mm-hmm. Same one.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.050
That is a very intense
life philosophy for a dentist,

11:57.134 --> 11:58.343
but okay.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.178
All right. Well,
thanks for being cool, Ingrid,

12:00.262 --> 12:02.013
- but we got to brainstorm,
so...
- Yeah.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.015
I want to help.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.517
I can be helpful.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.561
Right? I-I can be helpful?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.274
- Yes.
- Yeah...

12:12.357 --> 12:14.443
Let's do this.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.699
Hey, girl.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.834
Hey, boys.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.003
- Whew.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.636
- 'Kay.
- All right,

12:41.720 --> 12:43.013
I'm stepping out.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.557
- Aw.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.351
It is great being me.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.313
Oh!

12:52.355 --> 12:54.274
Okay. Pretty good.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.109
Now watch the master at work.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.904
- Whoa.
Conceited much?
- Oh.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.363
Giving the people
what they want.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.408
♪ Look at your girl...

13:03.492 --> 13:05.911
Oh. Afternoon, ladies.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.788
I seem to have misplaced
my shirt.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.041
- Has anybody... seen it?
- Whoa.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.626
Get a load of this slab of beef,

13:12.709 --> 13:14.920
- am I right, ladies?
- No. Yeah.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.631
- Did this guy pay
to buff out his avatar?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.049
- Oh, no.
- No?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.843
You're telling me
th-this is all-natural?

13:21.927 --> 13:22.928
Get out of town.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.930
His arms are a bit small.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.224
- What'd she say?
- She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.851
- I'd butter this biscuit, huh?
Hold the jam.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.603
That man is sweet enough.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.816
Your boy Nathan
is up to something.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.027
Oh, he's not my boy anymore.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.612
But...

13:40.695 --> 13:42.989
let's see what it is.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.700
Wow.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.246
Well, he seems happy, at least.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.372
There's a detective here,

13:50.455 --> 13:52.832
the 2Gigs
suddenly have data to spare

13:52.916 --> 13:54.417
and Nathan Brown
is running around

13:54.501 --> 13:56.044
like it was spring break 2028.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.839
There is definitely something
wrong with this picture.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.841
Jump in. See for yourself.

14:04.844 --> 14:09.015
So, dating clients,
is that an option?

14:23.405 --> 14:26.074
Hey, you going to poker night
tonight?

14:26.157 --> 14:27.576
I'm a euchre man
myself.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.995
Lots of money
is gonna change hands.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.831
It says there's
a no-limit table.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.499
I wish
there was a limit

14:34.583 --> 14:36.751
to this inane conversation.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.257
Why are you

14:42.340 --> 14:43.258
so smiley?

14:43.341 --> 14:44.259
Oh.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.719
Uh, 'cause look!

14:45.802 --> 14:48.388
I-I've got a 4.9!

14:48.471 --> 14:51.308
Man, people must've missed me.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.643
Actually, you're logged in
to my account.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.604
How is your rating higher
than mine?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.606
Everybody loves New Nora.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.608
She has no self-esteem.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.777
Oh. Man, wait,
you've been using my avatar?

15:02.861 --> 15:03.778
Yes.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.031
What the hell
are these other outfits?

15:10.785 --> 15:13.622
I was trying to find ways to...

15:13.705 --> 15:15.206
highlight your natural beauty.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.042
Oh, and there's nothing more
natural and beautiful to you

15:17.125 --> 15:18.251
than clowns?

15:18.335 --> 15:19.544
- Uh...

15:19.628 --> 15:21.087
Oh, crap.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.006
I got to go. Job...

15:23.089 --> 15:24.674
interview upstairs.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.550
A what?

15:25.634 --> 15:26.718
Uh, it's a long story.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.595
I'll-I'll explain later.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.974
You're lucky she ain't see
the one with the braids.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.434
Yeah. Thank you
for not saying anything.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.935
Mm-hmm.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.774
I found some irregularities
in your department.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.734
Oh. Uh, well...

15:42.817 --> 15:45.654
You had ten uploads so far today
complain of slow data speed,

15:45.737 --> 15:48.073
and they're
on the unlimited plan.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.575
I think someone is stealing data
and giving it to the 2Gigs.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.786
Oh.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.871
Oh, wow. Okay, yeah.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.623
Is that all?

15:56.706 --> 15:58.124
Okay, great.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.669
I wonder if that's why
the detective is here today.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.170
Wait, what? Detective?

16:02.253 --> 16:04.005
- Uh-huh.
- Like... police?

16:04.089 --> 16:05.006
Yeah.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.841
Oh, fuck.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.468
Could an upload

16:08.551 --> 16:10.553
ever access code
in the real world?

16:10.637 --> 16:11.846
Absolutely not.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.099
They can't even access
the Lakeview code.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.768
Only the IT
and design departments can.

16:16.851 --> 16:20.355
Am I crazy or is this,
like, super fun?

16:20.438 --> 16:22.232
Like, this right here,

16:22.315 --> 16:25.777
the three of us,
this is the band, you guys.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.700
I was joking, obviously. Um...

16:31.783 --> 16:33.284
Just a... joke.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.245
As you were saying, Detective.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.896
I wonder
what he's digging around for.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.648
- Mm.
- Doesn't seem like he cares

17:03.732 --> 17:06.484
about missing data or nudes.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.902
Nudes?

17:07.986 --> 17:09.654
Ew. Craig.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.489
Stop before you get in trouble.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.534
I think I know
how the data's being stolen.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.618
How?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.204
One of our penknives
came up missing.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.206
Jesus Christ, Craig.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.584
I have my people hacking away
to track it.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.837
Good. Because I would
hate to see you get fired

17:25.920 --> 17:27.672
over something like this.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.091
Fired?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.563
What's the plan?
We distract, you drain?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.482
No, there's too many people.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.066
We're gonna have to play.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.693
I don't know, man.
These guys have done nothing

17:48.777 --> 17:50.528
but play cards since they died.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.030
- They're sharks.
- Yeah.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.490
That's okay.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.658
We're not gonna play fair.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.827
These gloves are paired
to my penknife

17:57.911 --> 18:00.079
so I can change the cards
that are in your hand.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.581
Uh, wait.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.458
I'm more of a slots girl.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.877
- I...
- It's up to you, Ingrid.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.087
It's your account. We're gonna
be risking a lot of your money.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.799
But I really think
this could work.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.717
Aw, hell. Easy come...

18:12.801 --> 18:14.302
...easy go, right?

18:14.385 --> 18:15.345
Let's take these rich jerks

18:15.428 --> 18:16.471
for everything they've got.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.640
- Yes. That's my girl.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.687
- Okay. Okay.
- Mmm.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.899
- What's my role?
- You.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.444
Don't move. You're my eyes.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.158
Mesdames and messieurs,

18:37.242 --> 18:39.828
welcome to poker night
at Lakeview.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.830
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:41.913 --> 18:43.081
net worths.

19:03.852 --> 19:07.689
Hey, it's not the size--
it's what you do with it.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.527
Hmm. Okay.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.738
So, five years' experience
coding Anaconda?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.574
Yep.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.492
They call me the snake charmer.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.871
Of course, that's not something
you would ever use at this job.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.290
- Totally.
- Mm.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.916
- I know that.
- Uh-huh.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.419
And you're a judo black belt?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.254
Yup.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.338
Hi-yah!

19:32.422 --> 19:33.923
That's karate.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.925
It was like a...

19:36.009 --> 19:37.260
a mix.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.845
Okay.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.911
Ms. Kannerman?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.580
Oh.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.789
Uh...

20:06.873 --> 20:07.874
Um...

20:15.673 --> 20:17.050
Raise...

20:17.133 --> 20:19.594
$100,000.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.847
Mm.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.060
Players, reveal your cards.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.067
Three of a kind!

20:34.150 --> 20:35.485
Nushìmen xianshengmen,

20:35.568 --> 20:36.486
Ms. Kannerman wins!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.613
Yes. Yes.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.698
Yes, I do.

20:40.782 --> 20:44.827
Come here, come here, come here.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.958
Hey. One of your nerds
found the penknife.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.085
It's being used right now
in the atrium.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.879
Nora. Is that you?

20:56.089 --> 20:58.007
Hey... Lucy.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.426
Uh, what are you doing here?

21:00.510 --> 21:01.970
Interviewing.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.888
On this floor?

21:03.972 --> 21:05.765
Yeah, right.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.643
- Craig, come on. Chop, chop.
- Excuse me.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.561
- Let's go. Craig. Come on.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.146
I'm right behind you!

21:20.196 --> 21:22.240
Ms. Kannerman,
place your bet.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.883
Call.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.141
Jack-high flush.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.726
Ms. Kannerman wins again!

21:53.896 --> 21:55.356
Okay.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.109
So satisfying.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.569
You know what?

21:59.652 --> 22:02.989
This one is for you, sir.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.243
- You are as generous
as you are beautiful.
- Eh.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.454
Just don't spend it all
in one place.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.589
Hey there, folks!
Come to check out

22:19.672 --> 22:21.340
poker night, huh?
You don't want to miss this.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.426
The high rollers
are out in force. But hey.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.261
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Who wants to play cards, huh?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.846
- Pick a card, any card, huh?
- Oh, shit.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.892
Not in poker though.
You don't get to pick in poker.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.312
Okay. This all-American
farm boy one is glitching.

22:34.395 --> 22:37.815
Which means we must be close.
Mmm.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.319
Hmm.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.072
Oh, God.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.786
Last hand. We got to go.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.662
Oh, um...

22:51.746 --> 22:53.498
- All in.
- No. What?

22:53.581 --> 22:54.624
Call.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.958
Um...

22:56.042 --> 22:57.960
I ditched the penknife.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.172
Uh, just-just kidding.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.673
Never mind. No all in.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.759
No take-backsies.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.345
Players, reveal your cards.

23:10.598 --> 23:13.184
All good things
must come to an end.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.895
Okay. Okay.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.063
We can beat three kings.
You know?

23:17.146 --> 23:18.106
You just got to have faith.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.816
Come on, come on.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.527
Full house.

23:22.610 --> 23:23.653
And we're fucked.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.199
Uh... we could

23:28.282 --> 23:29.617
- still get a flush though,
right?
- No,

23:29.700 --> 23:30.827
it would have to be
a straight flush to win.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.245
And the odds of that happening
are, like...

23:32.328 --> 23:33.746
3.125%.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.706
- That's actually better
than I thought.
- Damn.

23:35.790 --> 23:38.126
Okay. So then just lucky seven.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.877
- Lucky seven of hearts, right?
Come on, come on.
- Seven of hearts.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.255
- Seven of hearts.
Come on, baby.
- Seven of hearts.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.892
Uh-oh.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.355
Come on, baby.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.193
- Whoo!
- What?!

24:04.277 --> 24:05.945
- Oh, my God!

24:09.824 --> 24:11.117
Wow!

24:16.122 --> 24:18.499
- Oh, my God!

24:18.583 --> 24:20.877
- Whoo! Winners!
- Did you see that?!

24:20.960 --> 24:23.671
- Yeah, yeah! I won big!
- Ha! Oh! Whoa!
- Okay.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.506
- Oh, my God...
- Oh, my God!

24:25.590 --> 24:27.341
- Aah!

24:30.511 --> 24:32.221
- Oh, what's up?! What's...
- Okay, we got to go.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.556
- We got to go.
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay, okay, okay.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.932
No, no, no. They'll credit
your account. Come on.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.726
- No, come on! Wait! Wait!
- Okay, all right.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.727
- Let's go.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.769
I don't know how it got there.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.272
- I swear, I'm innocent.
- Mm-mm-mm.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.984
Uh... Oh.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.068
You waited.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.904
Well, we're almost done.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.620
So, something I ask
all candidates--

24:55.703 --> 24:57.038
why here?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.706
I mean, if you're good enough
to code anywhere,

24:58.789 --> 25:01.542
why not someplace
more cutting-edge, like, um...

25:01.626 --> 25:03.377
Oscar Mayer Intel?

25:04.795 --> 25:08.466
Well, when I'm talking
to a client...

25:08.549 --> 25:11.802
I'm talking to someone
who would have been gone forever

25:11.886 --> 25:15.473
if they had died 15 years ago.

25:15.556 --> 25:19.352
And that makes this place
an actual miracle,

25:19.435 --> 25:22.021
e-even if we dress it up
in subscription fees,

25:22.104 --> 25:24.690
add-ons and data caps.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.484
And...

25:26.567 --> 25:29.195
who wouldn't want to be part
of a miracle?

25:29.278 --> 25:31.155
Hmm.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.991
Well, cybersecurity
is out of the question.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.410
You don't have the chops.
But we are adding headcount

25:36.494 --> 25:37.828
in Redesign.

25:37.912 --> 25:41.082
Got to up our game
now that Freeyond's coming out.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.833
It's mostly just bug hunting
for now.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.168
But you do a good job...

25:44.252 --> 25:45.169
who knows?

25:45.253 --> 25:47.255
Are you offering me a job?

25:47.338 --> 25:48.673
That's the point
of job interviews,

25:48.756 --> 25:49.799
as I understand them.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.301
- Wait, really?
- Mm-hmm.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.263
Holy crap.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.640
Y-Yes. Yeah, I'll-I'll take it.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.475
- Mm, okay.
- Uh... thank you.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.977
Yeah.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.311
Okay.

26:03.354 --> 26:04.605
Hmm.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.234
Nora, is this yours?

26:09.527 --> 26:10.987
- Nope.
- Hmm.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.280
Well.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.199
- Bronny James!

26:15.283 --> 26:17.034
Basketball.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.206
We're taking this place over.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.708
I'm just gonna be
fixing glitches.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.751
Today, glitches. Tomorrow...

26:25.835 --> 26:27.336
Bigger glitches?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.629
- And bigger paychecks.
- Mm.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.131
Hopefully.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.842
- Mm.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.722
Hey.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.473
So, I...

26:39.557 --> 26:42.310
actually wasn't on a trip
with Byron.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.145
Oh, my God.
What?

26:44.228 --> 26:45.980
That's crazy. I had no idea.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.149
This is a huge surprise.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.650
Oh, my gosh.

26:49.734 --> 26:52.903
Okay, well,
I want to tell you more, but...

26:52.987 --> 26:54.572
I can't.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.324
Okay.

26:56.407 --> 27:00.328
Well, I have a secret
I have no problem sharing.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.584
What are you gonna do?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.502
I don't know.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.589
Blackmail?

27:11.672 --> 27:13.716
Or...

27:13.799 --> 27:17.553
you could help me
with something.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.225
I'll call you back.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.228
I kept a close eye on it
for you.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.730
Thank you for that.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.858
Bye.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.118
Huh.

27:56.967 --> 28:00.805
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.100
And then we had dinner

28:04.183 --> 28:06.435
- with friends
in the dining room.
- Mm.

28:06.519 --> 28:07.770
Amazing selection.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.522
Oh, it was so nice.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.858
Oh, and I, uh,
parked you in the bathroom.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.443
Okay. Well,

28:14.527 --> 28:16.237
it certainly sounds
like you had a fun day.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.030
- Yeah.

28:18.114 --> 28:21.450
Oh. How nice that we both got
a little vacation.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.494
- Yes. Oh, I needed that.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.830
- Your life is cool!
- I know!

28:25.913 --> 28:27.248
Remove tip.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.253
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:36.966 --> 28:39.218
- Whoa.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.072
You were amazing today.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.741
I think that was the best day
we've ever had.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.452
I love you, babe.

29:17.298 --> 29:19.425
Next stop, Central.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.344
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.597
So, the program
just phoned home successfully.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.140
Good job, superspy.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.224
Thanks.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.644
Oh. Um, this is pretty crazy,

29:30.728 --> 29:33.481
but I actually did well
in the interview, too.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.815
I got a job.

29:34.899 --> 29:36.275
You what?

29:36.358 --> 29:37.526
How?

29:37.610 --> 29:39.195
It's not cybersecurity.
It's something else.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.280
But... it's great, right?

29:41.363 --> 29:42.740
I mean, I'm-I'm moving up.

29:42.823 --> 29:45.367
And maybe I can, like...

29:45.451 --> 29:47.620
change things from the inside.

29:47.703 --> 29:48.954
Yeah.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.831
What's so funny?

29:50.915 --> 29:52.500
Nothing. That's great. It is...

29:52.583 --> 29:54.043
It's, uh... I'm happy for you.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.920
It's just... ironic.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.463
That's all.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.632
Um, I got to go.
