The list you requested,
Your Majesty.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.040
Oh, thank you.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.670
Let's see.
Party hats, good.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.380
Piñata, good.
Chocolate fountain,
great.

01:21.380 --> 01:24.250
Elena, is that something
you need me to take a look at?

01:24.250 --> 01:25.750
Uh, no.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.750
It's, uh,
all looked at.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.420
Princess Elena,
we're ready for you.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.460
Oh!

01:32.460 --> 01:34.460
I did not know
we were having a meeting.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.790
We're not.
It's, uh...
a princess matter.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.380
Oh, right.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.210
And I am only
the chancellor.

01:40.210 --> 01:42.380
I'll be in the royal library
collecting dust

01:42.380 --> 01:44.670
with all the old books.

01:44.670 --> 01:45.960
Perfect. Have fun.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.920
Ay-yi-yi.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.170
She has no idea
it's my birthday.

01:50.170 --> 01:53.830
He has no idea we're
throwing him a surprise party.

01:53.830 --> 01:55.960
That was close.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.750
He's off to the library now,
so we're in the clear,

01:58.750 --> 02:01.000
and I have a list
of everything we need.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.670
I'm going to bake Esteban's
favorite  tres leches cake.

02:04.670 --> 02:07.620
That reminds me
of a story.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.290
Francisco, we don't
have time for this.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.960
When Esteban was a boy,

02:11.960 --> 02:14.670
he was such a picky eater,

02:14.670 --> 02:16.830
and you made him
the cake for his birthday,

02:16.830 --> 02:19.460
but the only way
to get him to eat it...

02:19.460 --> 02:21.670
Was to do the
"here comes the jaquin,

02:21.670 --> 02:23.500
flying into his nest."

02:25.290 --> 02:27.830
So what's the plan
for the music?

02:27.830 --> 02:29.750
My guitar is
all tuned up.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.880
Can I play the birthday
song with you?

02:31.880 --> 02:35.290
Of course, Isabel.
It will be a beautiful duet.

02:35.290 --> 02:36.830
Great. And party tricks?

02:36.830 --> 02:39.460
I've been practicing
all week.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.170
Maybe practice
some more.

02:44.170 --> 02:45.830
That wasn't the trick.

02:45.830 --> 02:48.120
Here it goes.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.920
Llévaluq!

02:52.670 --> 02:54.170
Bravo!

02:54.170 --> 02:55.750
Why, thank you.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.580
My gift!

02:57.580 --> 02:59.120
Good thing I kept
the receipt.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.040
Sorry. I broke
my concentration.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.830
I really need
to work on that.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.750
Well, you'll have
to do it later.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.620
Right now, you and I
have the most important
task of the day.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.920
What's that?

03:10.920 --> 03:12.710
Keeping Esteban
away from the palace

03:12.710 --> 03:14.670
so he doesn't find out
about the surprise.

03:14.670 --> 03:16.120
Right. Of course.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.580
We're taking him sailing.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.460
Good idea.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.040
Esteban loves sailing.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.170
Just make sure to have him
back in time for the party.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.750
Aye, aye,  Abuela.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.620
I cannot believe
everyone forgot my birthday.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.000
Happy birthday,
Chancellor Esteban.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.670
Oh, Higgins. No one wants
to pay attention to me anymore.

03:38.670 --> 03:42.460
I'm just getting older,
but I have nothing
to show for it.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.790
That's not true.
You've got loads of
new gray hairs.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.670
Getting old is no fun.

03:47.670 --> 03:50.670
Oh, how I wish
I were young again.

03:50.670 --> 03:51.790
Look at me, Higgins.

03:51.790 --> 03:54.710
Strong, handsome,
adventurous.

03:54.710 --> 03:57.170
I had so many big dreams
for my life

03:57.170 --> 03:59.120
that were never fulfilled

03:59.120 --> 04:01.040
because people were always
telling me what to do.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.830
First my grandparents,
then Shuriki.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.500
Guess what, cousin.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.420
Now, Elena.

04:07.420 --> 04:09.120
You're taking us
sailing today.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.460
See what I mean?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.670
As much as I would
love nothing more

04:13.670 --> 04:17.040
than to spend the day
chaperoning two
rambunctious teenagers,

04:17.040 --> 04:19.120
I'm afraid I am booked.
Right, Higgins?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.790
Actually, your schedule
is wide open.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.620
Anchors aweigh!

04:23.620 --> 04:25.500
The cruiser's all packed.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
And I found
this old nautical map

04:27.500 --> 04:28.830
in my grandfather's stuff.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.290
Oh, it must be magical.

04:33.290 --> 04:36.170
Look. There's the castle.

04:36.170 --> 04:38.080
And I can see my house.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.710
Did you just see that?
There. Tap on it.

04:40.710 --> 04:43.670
Tap on it.
Tap, tap, tap!

04:43.670 --> 04:45.080
Is that...

04:45.080 --> 04:47.380
The island of Santalos!

04:47.380 --> 04:48.880
What are we waiting for?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.880
Anchors aweigh!

04:52.960 --> 04:54.210
Come on, come on.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.420
We're walking,
we're walking.

04:56.420 --> 04:59.210
Why do you want to go to
the island of Santalos?

04:59.210 --> 05:01.420
It is rumored to have
a body of magical water

05:01.420 --> 05:03.210
called the Fountain
of Youth.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.460
If you drink the water,
you become younger.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.670
Or so the legend says.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.710
But, according to the myth,

05:09.710 --> 05:12.330
one day, it could be
just off the coast of Avalor,

05:12.330 --> 05:15.830
and the next, it'll be
on the other side of the world.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.460
Do you realize
what this means, Higgins?

05:18.460 --> 05:20.750
When I drink from
the fountain of youth,

05:20.750 --> 05:22.880
I will be young
and strong again.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.330
I'll finally start living
the life I always dreamt about.

05:26.330 --> 05:28.620
Prepare to cast off,
everyone.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.330
We are going
to Santalos!

05:46.790 --> 05:48.620
I'm ready
to rehearse.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.170
What is that?

05:50.170 --> 05:52.500
A new instrument
I invented.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.670
It's like an accordion
and a guitar put together.

05:54.670 --> 05:56.830
I call it
a guitardion.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.000
Mmm. I see.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.170
Okay. I will do
the first verse,

06:01.170 --> 06:03.750
and you can come in
after me.

Isa!

06:35.830 --> 06:37.620
Why aren't you playing?

06:37.620 --> 06:39.420
I thought this was supposed
to be a duet.

06:39.420 --> 06:42.790
A duet is a performance
where both people are heard.

06:42.790 --> 06:45.500
I can only hear that...
that...

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
Guitardion?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.460
Yes, that.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.880
And besides,
the birthday song

06:50.880 --> 06:53.790
is supposed to be
a sweet, heartfelt song,

06:53.790 --> 06:57.170
not an assault on
the eardrums.

06:57.170 --> 06:59.620
I thought it would be fun
to try something different.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.790
Either we play it the way
it was meant to be played

07:02.790 --> 07:03.920
or not at all.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.170
But I like my way.

07:05.170 --> 07:07.040
I have an idea.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.710
Why don't you both play
for the royal staff,

07:08.710 --> 07:11.880
and let them decide which one
should be played at the party?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.830
A birthday song battle?

07:13.830 --> 07:15.830
Okay by me.

07:15.830 --> 07:19.420
If a musical duel
is what you want, Isabel,

07:19.420 --> 07:22.330
then a duel
you'll get.

07:32.830 --> 07:34.750
According to the map,

07:34.750 --> 07:36.620
Santalos is supposed
to be right here.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.620
I don't get it.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.620
I do.

07:39.620 --> 07:42.670
Your magical map is maybe
not so magical after all.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.790
Wait. I see something
over there.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.750
It's Santalos!

07:48.460 --> 07:50.670
Santalos?! We better
drop anchor so...

07:51.960 --> 07:55.040
ESTEBAN: Done and done.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.000
Guard the ship, Higgins.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.500
I'm going ashore.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.580
Wait up, Esteban.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.960
You two stay here
while I scout the area

08:05.960 --> 08:07.380
to make sure it is safe.

08:07.380 --> 08:10.040
But I will need this.
Thank you.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.500
Out of my way.
Shoo, shoo!

08:12.500 --> 08:14.380
Where is he going?

08:14.380 --> 08:17.290
I don't know,
but we have to get him
back to the party on time,

08:17.290 --> 08:18.620
so we better not
lose him.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.460
Now let's find
that fountain of youth.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.120
Ah!

08:25.120 --> 08:26.830
There you are.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.880
It's a long way down.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.790
Okay.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.330
Ay, my hip!

08:48.330 --> 08:49.670
There it is.

08:49.670 --> 08:52.420
The fountain of youth.

08:57.290 --> 08:59.000
Farewell, old man.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.830
No. I am still old.

09:05.830 --> 09:08.330
Maybe I need some more.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.750
Why is this not working?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.670
Perhaps I did not
drink enough.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.250
Here's the map,

09:19.250 --> 09:21.250
but where's...

09:22.830 --> 09:23.960
Esteban!

09:26.790 --> 09:28.830
What?!

09:28.830 --> 09:31.500
- No!

09:31.500 --> 09:33.750
Well, what is it?

09:33.750 --> 09:36.120
The fountain of youth
myth is real!

09:37.670 --> 09:39.290
Look at me!

09:39.290 --> 09:41.880
I'm a young man again.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.250
I missed you, my friends.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.830
I must have more.

09:49.830 --> 09:51.830
I'd go easy
on the water.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.500
It is magical.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.000
Ay, Mateo,
you worry too much.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.830
Worrying is for
old people.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.750
From this day on,
I will never be old again.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.290
All I need to do is keep
magical water on hand,

10:03.290 --> 10:05.000
and at the first
sign of a wrinkle,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.250
drink some more.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.620
Where are you going?

10:07.620 --> 10:09.790
Wherever I please.

10:09.790 --> 10:11.620
No, wait.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.960
- Oh, he's acting
just like a...
- Teenager.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.790
Yep. Esteban, come back.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.710
Where did he go?

10:23.710 --> 10:25.380
I don't know.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.710
But we have to find him
and get off the island

10:27.710 --> 10:29.080
by the end of the day or...

10:31.420 --> 10:34.120
Esteban, stop.
This is serious.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.210
Whew!

10:50.040 --> 10:52.620
Elena!

10:52.620 --> 10:55.540
Oh, Higgins.

10:55.540 --> 10:59.420
Hey, that rowboat
is royal property.

10:59.420 --> 11:02.750
Put it down or I'll
report you to my boss.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.830
Hey, I am your boss.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.330
- I feel weird.

11:08.790 --> 11:10.460
Esteban?

11:10.460 --> 11:12.250
What happened to me?

11:12.250 --> 11:13.830
Why did I get younger?

11:13.830 --> 11:16.960
You drank
too much water.
I tried to warn you.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.710
Wait. Does this mean he's
going to keep getting
younger and younger?

11:19.710 --> 11:21.250
It looks that way.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.710
But I didn't wanna
be this young.

11:23.710 --> 11:27.380
Now everyone will
tell me what to do
all the time.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.290
I wanna be
a grown-up again.
Ooh, seagulls.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.250
It's getting late,

11:34.250 --> 11:36.580
and we have to leave this island
before the sun goes down,

11:36.580 --> 11:37.960
or we'll vanish
along with it.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.080
We can't take him
home like this.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.750
Can we?

11:41.750 --> 11:42.920
Maybe we don't have to.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.620
What do you mean?

11:44.620 --> 11:46.460
I saw a baby monkey
eat a petal from a flower,

11:46.460 --> 11:48.670
and he instantly
turned old.

11:48.670 --> 11:50.750
There's a magical flower
that makes you older?

11:50.750 --> 11:52.540
Where? I want it.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.210
It was by that waterfall.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.170
- There.
- ELENA: I'll go get it.

11:56.170 --> 11:58.380
- No. I will.
- No, wait.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.170
What if he eats
too much of the flower?

12:00.170 --> 12:01.830
Like he drank
too much water?

12:01.830 --> 12:03.750
We have to catch him.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.120
I should've brought
my running shoes.

Sorry,  mi amor.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.210
It looks like
they prefer the new way.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.710
The people have spoken.

13:01.710 --> 13:05.880
Isabel! Encore!
Encore! Whoo!

13:05.880 --> 13:07.670
Way to go!

13:07.670 --> 13:09.540
I love it!

13:12.040 --> 13:14.080
Esteban, stop.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.920
No way!

13:17.000 --> 13:18.330
Look out!

13:21.120 --> 13:24.040
I can jump it.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.040
I can't get out.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.830
He's in quick-sap.

13:32.830 --> 13:35.460
Stop moving or you'll
start sinking.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.040
We'll help you.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.830
Mateo, look for something
he can grab on to.

13:38.830 --> 13:40.620
I don't need your help.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.170
I can do it myself.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.670
I'm sinking!

13:45.420 --> 13:46.830
Grab the branch.

13:46.830 --> 13:48.210
Don't tell me what to do.

13:48.210 --> 13:49.880
Do you wanna get out or not?

13:54.040 --> 13:55.620
Grab it with both hands.

14:01.830 --> 14:03.250
I got you.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.120
You're trembling.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.500
No, I'm not.
I don't tremble.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
I am brave.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.830
Now where is
that magical flower?

14:11.830 --> 14:13.710
Hmm. Let me check the map.

14:13.710 --> 14:15.750
It's over here.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.250
Right through
those trees.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.460
Here we go again.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.170
ELENA: Wait!

14:32.170 --> 14:33.830
Don't eat too much.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.500
I'll eat as much as I want,

14:35.500 --> 14:36.960
and you can't stop me.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.170
Cousin, give me
the flower.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.620
Mateo, grab him.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.790
Esteban, come down.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.710
No

14:47.710 --> 14:50.080
I'm king of the tree.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.880
The flower!

14:52.880 --> 14:56.170
Um, Elena?
The sun is
starting to set.

14:56.170 --> 14:58.790
Being late to the party
is the least of our problems.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.210
Forget the party.
We are going to vanish

15:01.210 --> 15:04.620
if we don't get off
the island before the sun sets.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.620
He's a baby now?

15:08.620 --> 15:12.880
All I have to say is,
I am not changing any diapers.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.290
The canteen.
He's slipping.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.620
Esteban, I'm coming.

15:22.830 --> 15:23.710
Gotcha!

15:23.710 --> 15:25.670
Whew!

15:27.620 --> 15:29.460
Oh, sh, sh.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.080
Don't cry.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.880
It's all right.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.210
Everything's okay now.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.210
Elena, sorry to interrupt,
but look up.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.460
The island is disappearing.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.250
We need to go now.

16:51.250 --> 16:54.210
What about the flower?
We need it for Esteban.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.580
There's no way to climb
up there in time.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.290
There must be
another way.

16:58.290 --> 17:01.210
Hm. There is one way.
Ow!

17:01.210 --> 17:02.920
What are you doing?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.040
Getting that flower,
I hope.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.120
I haven't done this spell
on anything bigger than
a present,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.120
and you saw
how that went.

17:10.120 --> 17:13.080
Floating spell?
But if it doesn't work,
you could get hurt.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.540
I just have
to concentrate.
That's all.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.830
Wish me luck,
just not out loud.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.620
Llévaluq!

17:20.920 --> 17:23.250
Oh, Mateo.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.620
- Mateo!

17:30.620 --> 17:32.790
Llévaluq!

17:44.710 --> 17:46.830
- Thanks.
- Give it to him now.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.670
We'll move quicker
if he's running.

17:48.670 --> 17:51.250
Open up.
I hope this works.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.830
What are you doing?

17:52.830 --> 17:54.880
You have to eat the petal.

17:54.880 --> 17:59.290
Your grandparents did say
he was a picky eater
as a child.

17:59.290 --> 18:02.210
Now is not the time
to be a picky eater.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.120
Wait.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.540
Here comes the jaquin,

18:07.540 --> 18:10.250
flying to its nest.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.750
Why am I sucking my thumb?

18:20.750 --> 18:22.960
And where are my pants?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.670
It's a long story.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.750
But right now, we have to
get off this island

18:26.750 --> 18:29.670
- before we vanish.
- The boat is this way.
Follow me.

18:29.670 --> 18:33.420
Yes. I still have
a little water left.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.120
Esteban! Help me!

19:00.290 --> 19:02.000
You saved my life.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.500
It is the least I could do.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.580
after you saved mine.

19:12.830 --> 19:14.710
Elena, Esteban!

19:19.120 --> 19:20.670
Come on!

19:26.290 --> 19:27.750
Get in!

19:30.120 --> 19:31.670
- Ay, my hip.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.880
MATEO: That was close.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.540
ESTEBAN:
This is true.

19:47.790 --> 19:51.330
I wonder where
the island is now.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.120
I'll check the map.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.460
Oh, I must've dropped it
back there.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.670
I guess I am
old for good.

19:58.670 --> 20:02.290
Personally, Esteban,
I like you better this age.

20:18.790 --> 20:20.460
Where is everyone?

20:20.460 --> 20:23.210
ALL: Surprise!

20:23.210 --> 20:25.420
Happy birthday!

20:25.420 --> 20:26.790
I thought you forgot.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.830
Of course
we didn't forget.

20:28.830 --> 20:31.500
Elena planned
the whole thing.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.790
Anything for
my favorite cousin.

20:33.790 --> 20:36.000
Ah, Elena,
I am your only cousin.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.790
Oh, don't be like that.

20:37.790 --> 20:41.830
I know, deep down,
you wuv me.

20:41.830 --> 20:46.670
And now, Isabel will play
a birthday song.

20:46.670 --> 20:49.790
Uh, I can't do it.

20:49.790 --> 20:53.330
Unless  Abuelo joins me.

20:53.330 --> 20:55.790
What? But I don't know
how to play your way.

20:55.790 --> 20:58.420
We won't play it
my way or your way.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.170
We'll play it our way.

21:00.170 --> 21:01.580

young again, cousin.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.790
Ah! I am better off
my own age.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.290
Well,  Abuelo always says

21:44.290 --> 21:47.420
that every gray hair
makes him that much wiser.

21:47.420 --> 21:48.790
If that's true,

21:48.790 --> 21:51.000
you should be a genius
by now, chancellor.
