WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:10.128
(Rattling)

00:10.261 --> 00:12.252
(Slam)

00:36.871 --> 00:38.361
Finally.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.451
Daymo.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.586
(Slam)

00:48.674 --> 00:51.586
— Boy, what you doin' in jail?
- I don't know.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.882
What do you mean, you don't know?
What the fuck you get arrested for?

00:55.014 --> 00:57.847
|to|d you, LaDonna, Idon't know.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.976
Messing around with that dope again,
ain't it?

01:02.104 --> 01:04.095
(Chuckling)

01:06.150 --> 01:09.358
Ma goin' crazy behind this.
You took her through hell.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.287
Get me out of here, sis.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.749
(Water splashing, echoing)

01:27.380 --> 01:31.498
— Come on, get me out.
- (Chuckling)

03:34.632 --> 03:36.964
I'm glad you found your way back.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.460
And it's good of you to stop by today,
Mr. President,

03:40.596 --> 03:43.429
if only for a short visit.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.220
It lets us know that New Orleans
still has your heart.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.560
Half of our people are not home.

03:49.688 --> 03:53.021
Charity Hospital is still closed,

03:53.150 --> 03:56.358
with people dying down here
for lack of medical care.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.853
And, yes, I know
we're only five months away

03:58.989 --> 04:01.446
from the next hurricane season

04:01.575 --> 04:05.909
with our flood control
still in a state of half—assedness.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.994
Hey, what can we expect?

04:08.124 --> 04:09.830
We're not the Dutch,

04:10.626 --> 04:14.039
who keep half their country
out of the North Sea

04:14.171 --> 04:16.207
as a matter of routine.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.626
We're just Americans

04:18.759 --> 04:20.590
doing the best we can manage.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.586
But I digress.

04:25.057 --> 04:28.049
What I mean to say, Mr. President,

04:29.311 --> 04:32.018
is that I continue to believe

04:32.148 --> 04:34.639
in the better angel of your nature,

04:36.402 --> 04:39.735
the one who, a few days after the storm,

04:39.864 --> 04:42.150
stood in front of a floodlit Jackson Square

04:42.283 --> 04:45.150
and promised to rebuild the Gulf Coast.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.528
So let me banish from my mind

04:48.664 --> 04:51.451
the image of you lightly joking

04:51.584 --> 04:56.544
about the high times you spent here
in our city as a youth

04:56.672 --> 05:00.130
while bodies floated in our streets.

05:01.427 --> 05:05.340
And far be it from me,
with all my excesses and impulses,

05:05.473 --> 05:10.263
to judge you for a few
untethered, unfocused words.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.682
All will be forgiven, Mr. President,

05:15.024 --> 05:18.437
if you just simply take a moment,

05:18.569 --> 05:20.355
as I often do,

05:20.488 --> 05:23.446
and watch yourself in Jackson Square

05:23.574 --> 05:26.361
and listen to those stirring words.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.446
And then keep your fucking promise.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.532
(Dogs barking)

05:51.143 --> 05:54.681
I need to use the bathroom, but I didn't
want to come through till you were awake.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.849
Um, go ahead.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.486
Sonny?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.284
(Splashing)

06:15.417 --> 06:17.248
— Sonny?
- Hm?

06:18.587 --> 06:22.546
How long is your new friend
supposed to stay here?

06:22.675 --> 06:24.165
Mm.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.179
(Toilet flushing)

06:35.688 --> 06:37.974
You crawled into bed late.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.723
— Did you get much done?
— Some.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.068
I had something to say.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.613
Who got the "F you" this time?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.905
Oh, you can say "fuck."
She can't hear you over that bounce rap,

06:52.037 --> 06:54.574
where her heroes
are undoubtedly saying "fuck"

06:54.707 --> 06:57.665
and "shit" and "keep off me, bitch."

06:57.793 --> 07:01.160
No progress on the novel? Classes startin'.

07:01.297 --> 07:06.917
— The novel seems so unimportant, academic.
— What is more important than your writing?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.258
Your real writing?

07:08.387 --> 07:11.754
— Krewe du Vieux, maybe.
— Oh, that nonsense.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.018
The first parade after the storm
is not nonsense.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.135
It sets the tone.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.889
I take my responsibilities very seriously.
Hence the haircut.

07:21.025 --> 07:22.981
I thought that was for Tulane coming back.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.443
— Tulane, | change my underwear.
- (Laughing) Oh, I see!

07:26.572 --> 07:28.654
What's the Krewe du Vieux theme this year?

07:28.782 --> 07:33.242
George Bush, Kathleen Blanco,
Ray Nagin, sperm.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.821
- Seriously.
— (Chuckling)

07:38.208 --> 07:40.540
(Distant sirens whoop)

07:46.425 --> 07:47.665
(Knocking)

07:53.682 --> 07:56.765
Just curious. How do you always manage
to get past the desk sergeant?

07:56.894 --> 08:01.388
I brought king cake.
If you want a slice, you'd better hustle.

08:01.523 --> 08:05.516
Batiste, Antoine. Remind me again.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.019
His trombone.
It's not at temporary evidence,

08:08.155 --> 08:13.570
it's not with your arresting officers,
it's not on any property slip in the court file.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.240
— I'll throw some calls.
— Thanks, Terry.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.041
(Horn honks)

08:23.170 --> 08:27.038
— (LaDonna) That's him. That's him.
— You're sure, right?

08:27.174 --> 08:29.540
You think I'm gonna forget that man?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.676
Yeah, you.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.717
- You.
— You need me, boss.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.805
— You done any roofin'?
— I've done it all.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.017
And I speak English, if that matters.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.852
You.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.482
And that's it. That's it.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.270
All right, this should be easy enough.
I can take it from here.

08:47.403 --> 08:50.861
Oh, hell no. I want to see his ugly grill
when you serve up them papers.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.854
I ain't missing this no how.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.027
— Let me just lock my car.
- (Beeps)

08:55.160 --> 08:56.491
Come on.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.656
Yeah, I gotcha.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.373
(Toni) Well, you better call him.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.834
Yeah, all right then.
I'll call the man. Thanks, Toni.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.045
— You're welcome.
— Good lookin' out.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.549
(Phone beeps)

09:09.675 --> 09:13.042
Ooh, oh! You fine, girl! Where you headed?

09:13.178 --> 09:16.261
They got a temporary personnel office up
for the school system.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.257
I need to go see what happens to me
now that Fortier isn't gonna reopen.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.179
— You doin' that today?
- School's starting.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.269
I don't let 'em know I'm back,
they gonna give that job away.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.104
Who was that?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.269
- The lawyer.
— They find your 'bone?

09:28.402 --> 09:33.442
Naw, not yet. But she got this number
for these cats from Japan, jazz fans and shit.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.862
They hooked up with the Tipitina Foundation and want to
help out with stuff.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.280
Payin' cash money on instruments and all.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.994
— They from Japan?
— Mm—hm.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.330
— Japan Japan?
— Mm—hm. That's what she say.

09:43.459 --> 09:47.202
I'm supposed to call the man at the hotel. Might have to go
downtown to meet him.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.170
— You got the baby today.
- No, see, but...

09:50.299 --> 09:51.960
But my ass. I'm out.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.634
(Baby coos)

10:01.310 --> 10:03.016
(Tools buzzing)

10:03.145 --> 10:07.309
(Men speaking Spanish)

10:11.904 --> 10:14.020
— Tenemos los shingles.
— OK.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.442
— (Man) Thaddeus Riley?
- Yeah.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.157
You are hereby served.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.369
Yeah. I gotcha.

10:22.498 --> 10:25.581
I gotcha good, Riley. We goin' to court.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.916
Miss Ladee, you didn't need to do this.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.910
Y'all crazy to work for this man.

10:30.047 --> 10:33.255
Like as not, he gonna plead poverty
when it come time to pay y'all.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.920
— That's how he do.
- Shit.

10:38.680 --> 10:44.425
(Speaking Spanish)

10:48.732 --> 10:51.348
OK, 50 each, four songs.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.350
12.50 a song, man?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.570
I'm already paying seven players
and two back-up singers.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.905
— I can't afford more.
— Broke—ass guitar player.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.491
— But you're not doing it for the money.
— I'm not?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.906
This is for New Orleans in her hour of need.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.280
Man, I've been in my hour of need
my whole damn life.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.250
— Where New Orleans been for me?
— (Splutters)

11:10.379 --> 11:14.042
Years from now, you're gonna be sittin' here
staring into the deep...

11:14.174 --> 11:16.381
and compassionate eyes of a man...

11:16.510 --> 11:19.798
a stranger, perhaps, who's trying
to explain the meaning of your life...

11:19.930 --> 11:21.716
Get a grip, seriously.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.807
Your noblest deeds,
your finest accomplishments.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.300
I can tune a bass drunk.

11:26.436 --> 11:30.554
And you will justify yourself by saying
that for next to no money at all...

11:32.860 --> 11:36.148
I played on DJ Davis McAlary's...

11:36.280 --> 11:38.441
legendary...
four—song epistle...

11:38.574 --> 11:41.657
— against all that is unholy and...
- (Bangs table)

11:41.785 --> 11:43.025
..corrupt. ..

11:43.161 --> 11:45.288
in the government of New Orleans!

11:45.414 --> 11:47.746
Man, is this epistle in B flat, at least?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.412
B flat, fine.
And that compassionate stranger,

11:50.544 --> 11:52.956
his eyes will widen.

11:53.088 --> 11:57.081
And by virtue of your participation
in this musical recording alone...

11:57.217 --> 12:00.209
he will view your naked humanity
in a new light.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.630
Is this the dirty part?

12:01.763 --> 12:02.889
He will say unto you...

12:03.015 --> 12:05.347
"That is really great, pal.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.059
"But it's closing time. You need to put that
in a go cup and get the fuck out."

12:09.187 --> 12:11.724
(All laughing)

12:11.857 --> 12:14.098
— Right? You're in!
— All right, Davis, you're on.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.691
- Yes!
— Man, give me my fiddy now.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.311
Yeah! Gotta wash my hands now!

12:19.448 --> 12:21.484
Team McAlary! Whoo!

12:21.617 --> 12:23.107
Yes!

12:24.119 --> 12:25.450
Asshole.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.118
Sorry I'm late, Toni.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.413
Let me tell you, if my afternoon
is anything like my morning,

12:33.545 --> 12:35.581
— this here gonna be right.
- What happened?

12:35.714 --> 12:39.423
I'm just sayin', this lawyerin' shit
could get good to a person.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.668
Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.840
Section A of the Criminal Court,

12:44.973 --> 12:49.057
Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana,
is now in session.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.598
The Honorable John Gatling presiding.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.267
God save this state and the honorable court.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.775
Please be seated.

12:55.901 --> 12:59.189
(Judge Gatling)
So, what's left of this afternoon

12:59.321 --> 13:03.030
is all about Brooks v.
Orleans Criminal Sheriff's Office

13:03.158 --> 13:05.274
and the Louisiana
Department of Corrections.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.698
— A habeas corpus. Miss Bernette?
— Yes, Your Honor.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.617
Representing the family
of David Maurice Brooks,

13:11.750 --> 13:15.038
we seek to compel OPCSO
and state corrections officials

13:15.170 --> 13:16.785
to provide immediate relief...

13:16.922 --> 13:21.712
That's some bullshit. These motherfuckers
got to be out their goddamn mind.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.255
- What up, Big Chief?
— Gralen, what you up to, baby?

13:24.388 --> 13:26.879
Four hours we've been up there, Chief.
Four hours, man,

13:27.015 --> 13:28.926
tryin' to find somebody
to make some sense

13:29.059 --> 13:30.924
out of this second line
we tryin' to do Sunday.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.928
I heard about that.
All y'all tryin' to march together, right?

13:34.064 --> 13:38.398
Man, damn near 30 clubs have got together tryin' to get
their people back on the street.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.394
Say, bro, we got the permit,
we got the word out.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.612
Man, we got everybody comin'.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.356
And these folks have
the audacity to cancel our permit

13:46.493 --> 13:48.154
and try to shut our parade down.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.618
(Hirsh) Now we got three days
to change their damn minds.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.908
(Banks) They be talkin'
that old sideways shit, man.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.542
— What you down here doin'?
— Me?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.580
| just want to ask why they still got
all the projects boarded up.

13:57.713 --> 14:00.420
— People need to come home.
— It's like they don't want New Orleans

14:00.549 --> 14:02.039
— to be New Orleans no more.
- Mm-hm.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.382
— Who you tryin' to see, man?
— Singleton, to start.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.173
Good luck with that.
You get past his secretary, let us know.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.967
Chief, we out, baby.
Look, we gonna be out there Sunday.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.590
— All right.
— I'll look for you.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.718
- All right now.
— Take care. Let's roll.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.594
All right, baby.

14:15.731 --> 14:18.473
(Toni) That is the nightmare
being lived by David Maurice Brooks,

14:18.608 --> 14:21.395
his mother, his family and friends.

14:21.528 --> 14:26.613
I've spoken with an inmate who saw
David Brooks on the Broad Street overpass

14:26.742 --> 14:30.451
and later encountered him at Hunt,
where they swapped lD wristbands.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.570
— Where is that affidavit?
— Miss Dufossat.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.369
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
— Judge, the inmate, Keevon White,

14:36.501 --> 14:38.162
is a reluctant witness.

14:38.295 --> 14:41.537
But an order by this court
could compel his testimony,

14:41.673 --> 14:44.130
which, coupled with this photograph,

14:44.259 --> 14:46.500
will establish that David Brooks

14:46.636 --> 14:49.719
was in OPP custody during the storm.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.759
Now you, Miss Dufossat.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.764
Your Honor, unfortunately,
we cannot interrogate

14:56.897 --> 14:59.639
that rather grainy long—distance photograph

14:59.775 --> 15:02.391
to ascertain the identity
of the person shown.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.688
— The simple fact is...
— It is my brother.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.279
- That's Daymo in that picture.
— (Gatling) Ma'am, please don't do that.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.740
I say the simple fact, Your Honor,

15:10.869 --> 15:12.905
is that there exists no documentation

15:13.038 --> 15:16.121
to indicate that Mr. David Maurice Brooks

15:16.249 --> 15:18.831
was in custody during
or after Hurricane Katrina.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.872
There's no arrest report, no booking record.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.792
There are more than 3,000 citizens
of the Gulf Coast

15:24.925 --> 15:27.132
who are still missing and unaccounted for.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.512
Mr. David Brooks
just happens to be one of them.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.254
And that is regrettable.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.472
But Miss Bernette
has no compelling evidence

15:34.601 --> 15:37.513
that this is the responsibility
of the State of Louisiana

15:37.646 --> 15:39.477
or the Criminal Sheriff's Office.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.641
Is there no documentation at all,
Miss Bernette?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.938
Your Honor, I don't need to remind you

15:46.071 --> 15:49.438
that 80% of New Orleans went underwater.

15:49.574 --> 15:54.318
80% of our papenNork, not to mention
much of the computer database.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.661
Chaos is a given, Your Honor.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.757
There. Hey.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.801
You're not doing it right.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.220
Hey, there.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.014
Let me guess.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.184
You come all the way from Houston
for the big second line Sunday.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.309
I came to check up on you, seein' as
how Delmond's on the road and all.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.527
| just wanted to make sure you was OK.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.614
— I'm fine. I'm fine.
— | see you fine.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.951
I'm gonna go park the car and then
you can introduce me to your new friend.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.945
Go on.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.573
(Laughing)

16:43.003 --> 16:44.584
Let me.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.879
— Davina, right?
— Yeah.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.999
(Chuckles)

16:51.428 --> 16:53.043
(J‘ Classical)

16:57.184 --> 17:00.597
J‘ One year

17:00.729 --> 17:04.642
J‘ Ain't no crime

17:04.774 --> 17:06.856
J‘ I got boys, boys

17:06.985 --> 17:08.600
J‘ In Angola

17:08.737 --> 17:11.695
J‘ They doin' 14 to 99 J‘

17:11.823 --> 17:14.314
Beignets. Get up in those, man.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.491
(Laughs)

17:35.222 --> 17:38.806
Listen, I got some pretty good hookups
on some day work here, so...

17:38.934 --> 17:43.177
I'd do more, but the faster I get enough
for a room of my own, the faster I can...

17:43.313 --> 17:45.645
— Where's all that from, dawg?
- Roofing gigs.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.231
Three days, three different crews.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.648
(Whispering)

18:02.958 --> 18:04.823
I'll pay you back, bro. No problem.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.292
Annie, I'll be back.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.337
He copped in Houston, didn't he?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.023
So what can you do now?

18:31.152 --> 18:33.564
I've got to go deeper, pry something up.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.860
A police report, an inmate roster, anything.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.732
And prove that they have him.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.278
- Crazy.
— Uh—huh.

18:40.412 --> 18:44.530
Hey, Toni, Creighton, come in.
Welcome.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.658
You know,
I really loved that last video you did.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.035
Well, JoAnn, I confess
I loved saying it.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.004
— lt rolled off the tongue.
— It certainly needed to be said.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.293
Welcome.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.501
Cray! Cray Bernette!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.923
Roy Blount. Jesus.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.637
Man, it's good to see you.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.758
Good to see us all back here
at Upperline, you know?

19:04.894 --> 19:06.976
You know Joan and Tom and Beth Ann.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.811
And everybody knows Cray.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.805
Cray is the man of the hour,

19:10.942 --> 19:13.524
using that new YouTube thing
on the computer.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.065
He just goes on there and fires away.

19:16.197 --> 19:19.564
Oh, God, Roy, I don't think I believed

19:19.701 --> 19:23.740
anyone would hear it or hold me accountable till this
moment.

19:23.872 --> 19:27.160
— lt's embarrassing.
— No, it's nothing of the kind.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.749
"Fuck you, you fucking fucks!"

19:29.878 --> 19:33.746
Raw, reductive power is the voice
of this town right now.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.589
"Fuck" is a command,
"fuck" is an adjective,

19:36.718 --> 19:38.424
"fuck" is a noun and object.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.545
No, I'm serious, Creighton.
It is poetry.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.466
Bon appetit, everyone.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.222
Did you see the video? Whoo!

19:52.067 --> 19:55.730
There are times when rage
is the only rational response.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.104
He pulling my leg?

19:59.949 --> 20:03.077
Butter comes out of Roy Blount's pen
sentence after sentence,

20:03.203 --> 20:05.865
and here he is comparing
my shit talk to Shakespeare.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.374
I can't tell, honestly.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.083
I think he's fucking with me.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.711
— "Davis for council"?
— (Freeman) Your mind is gone.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.550
It's all theater, man.
If nominated, I will pretend to run.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.965
And if elected, I won't even pretend to serve.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.340
You're messing with Smiley Lewis.

20:26.476 --> 20:30.014
No. New lyrics, though.
Incisive, provocative. Smiley'd be proud.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.013
Man, you need a fat-ass trumpet
to riff on Shame, Shame, Shame.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.810
All is well. Remain calm.

20:34.943 --> 20:38.936
— You want to cut bass and drums first?
- What band is this, Journey? No.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.564
Everyone in the big room all at once.
Classic New Orleans R&B.

20:42.700 --> 20:46.033
OK, cool, but you have to call me Cosimo
for the rest of the session.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.244
— (Laughter)
— (Kermit) All aboard!

20:48.373 --> 20:51.831
— Fearless leader.
— Oh, Freeman! They hook you too?

20:51.960 --> 20:55.748
— I can't believe you got Kermit.
— I will have you know that Mr. Ruffins and l

20:55.880 --> 21:00.169
played together in our earlier days.
Our musical roots are hopelessly intertwined.

21:00.301 --> 21:04.169
Oh, we was bad!
Not bad good, just bad!

21:04.305 --> 21:07.172
— I mean, we was triflin'!
— (All laughing)

21:17.777 --> 21:19.642
— (Sofia) Hello.
— Hey, hey.

21:20.572 --> 21:21.937
What's all this?

21:22.073 --> 21:26.237
Oh, these are all that's left from some files
from an office that got flooded.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.906
— What kind of files are they?
- Parole and probation.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.370
The people there gave me
everything they could find.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.239
Said it was all worthless and ruined.

21:33.376 --> 21:37.039
(Laughs) You know what?
I'm beginning to think they're right.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.629
Oh. Can young eyes read that?

21:42.051 --> 21:44.303
Me neither.

21:47.307 --> 21:51.391
Oh, Sof, by the way, you need to talk
to your father about all your texting.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.726
The phone bill came in last month,
and I gotta say it.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.937
— I can read this, though.
- What?

21:58.443 --> 22:02.903
I think that says "Field interest."

22:03.031 --> 22:05.317
And that there on the line below

22:05.450 --> 22:07.782
is "Webster," see?

22:09.370 --> 22:12.988
"Field interview," maybe.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.206
"Webster."

22:15.335 --> 22:17.451
Webster Street?

22:17.587 --> 22:18.918
Does that help any?

22:19.047 --> 22:20.912
Hm!

22:21.049 --> 22:22.209
(Laughing)

22:29.849 --> 22:32.465
Look, up in the sky! It's a bird!

22:32.602 --> 22:34.718
It's a plane! lt's...

22:34.854 --> 22:37.311
(Mimics George W Bush)
Hell, yeah, I'm with you, New Orleans.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.183
Bring this bird down to 8,000 feet.
Let's have a look-see. Oh, no.

22:41.319 --> 22:45.062
Oh, no, that's not good at all.
Your city's wet. Really wet!

22:45.198 --> 22:48.065
It must be twice as bad on the ground.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.489
(New voice) Twice as bad? Twice as bad?

22:51.621 --> 22:54.078
— You think?
— (Music crescendos)

22:54.207 --> 22:57.745
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya

22:59.212 --> 23:03.251
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya

23:05.218 --> 23:08.756
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
what you have done

23:10.181 --> 23:13.048
J‘ We was on the ropes,
we were down and out

23:13.184 --> 23:16.301
J‘ You flew on over, never did come down

23:16.437 --> 23:19.975
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya

23:21.651 --> 23:25.314
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya

23:27.198 --> 23:30.861
J‘ Shame, shame, shame,
what you have done J‘

24:04.569 --> 24:07.686
So dig it. Now we've got
the people of New Orleans

24:07.822 --> 24:11.781
living on air force bases and in ratty—ass motels from Utah
to Georgia,

24:11.909 --> 24:15.572
and people in Washington talking about keeping the
housing projects closed.

24:15.705 --> 24:20.074
Yeah, that's right. They don't want no more poor people
coming back to New Orleans.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.417
But I'll tell you what, New Orleans
without poor people ain't New Orleans,

24:23.546 --> 24:26.083
because it's the people
without a pot to piss in

24:26.215 --> 24:29.833
who keep the beat and blow the horns
and step in the streets.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.632
And right now y'all are stuck listening
to this messed—up white boy

24:33.765 --> 24:37.849
because whichever 14—year—old from
Lafitte Projects is the next Smiley Lewis,

24:37.977 --> 24:40.593
he's stuck out there in East Bumfuck, Texas.

24:40.730 --> 24:44.564
He can't get home to sing this fucking song!

24:44.692 --> 24:48.276
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
on you now, Dubya

24:50.198 --> 24:53.736
J‘ Shame, shame, shame,
on you now, Dubya

24:55.870 --> 25:00.580
J‘ Shame, shame, shame
about what you've done! J‘

25:03.711 --> 25:05.372
Whoo!

25:07.382 --> 25:10.670
What? What? That was great!

25:10.802 --> 25:13.635
(Woman) Yes, indeed.
(Freeman) That was some true shit!

25:13.763 --> 25:17.221
Just to make absolutely sure
we're talking about the same person.

25:19.143 --> 25:22.727
Sure, that's David.
And you've been looking for him?

25:22.855 --> 25:26.598
Here I am sampling your menu once a week with no clue
that David worked for you.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.817
The family mentioned other restaurants.
Mister B's, lrene's.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.528
Daymo worked different places
different nights.

25:32.657 --> 25:37.151
We don't see the Webster Street mention
of a parole agent's visit, I don't find you.

25:37.286 --> 25:38.662
How long did he work here?

25:38.788 --> 25:41.996
We hired him about four months
before the storm, maybe five.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.413
Dishwasher to start.
But by August, he was a back waiter.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.501
— Reliable, huh?
— Sure, yeah.

25:47.630 --> 25:50.588
— Right until Katrina, anyway.
- And then what happened?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.834
I called Jacques early that morning
right before the rain started.

25:53.970 --> 25:58.054
l was already in Alabama and Jacques
was getting out of town with his cousin,

25:58.182 --> 26:00.764
but we forgot the meat in the freezer, so...

26:00.893 --> 26:04.010
So I called Daymo
because I knew he hadn't left

26:04.147 --> 26:06.308
and | asked if he could go by the restaurant

26:06.441 --> 26:09.433
and take the meat to a shelter
or give it away.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.651
— And he say, "No problem."
- He had a key?

26:11.779 --> 26:15.192
We kept one in the false brick front outside
the kitchen entrance for emergencies.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.736
The hurricane was an emergency, so...

26:18.327 --> 26:21.410
— And the meat?
— Rancid as anything when we got back.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.746
I had to replace the walk—in.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.662
The door key was...where we left it.

26:26.794 --> 26:30.252
— And Daymo?
— Never came back.

26:30.381 --> 26:35.000
The mobile number we had for him was dead.
And...nothing.

26:38.431 --> 26:41.673
If he got locked up,
it was for something, you know?

26:41.809 --> 26:44.471
Or maybe he started gettin' high in jail.

26:44.604 --> 26:49.018
If he did get out somehow, he could be
in Houston or wherever right now,

26:49.150 --> 26:51.562
and he ain't gonna pick up the phone,
'cause he ashamed.

26:51.694 --> 26:56.814
— He wouldn't call to let you know where he at?
— If he usin', that'd break Mama's heart.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.694
(Chuckles) You must be...

27:03.831 --> 27:05.696
Koichi Toyama.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.744
— You are Antoine Batiste?
— Yeah.

27:07.877 --> 27:11.461
Welcome to New Orleans.
Get you something before you two set off?

27:12.840 --> 27:15.798
Oh... Sazerac, perhaps?

27:15.927 --> 27:19.419
Don't get much call for Sazeracs in here.
Got a second choice?

27:19.555 --> 27:22.797
- Abita Amber?
— That we can do.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.760
| see you've been down here some.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.483
Thank you.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.482
— Cheers.
— Cheers.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.492
— Mm!
— (News on TV)

27:40.618 --> 27:44.907
— I bet you miss these.
— They got sandwiches in Houston, Daddy.

27:45.039 --> 27:47.451
Lots of good food. Great Mexican.

27:47.583 --> 27:51.326
— Mm.
— (Man) ..strong buildings and new schools

27:51.462 --> 27:53.293
because our future is here.

27:54.799 --> 27:57.290
New Orleans is our home.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.087
I am happy...

27:59.220 --> 28:01.176
That's the man that ducked me yesterday.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.261
Baby, can you drive me east?

28:03.391 --> 28:06.428
— What, now?
- Mm-hm.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.694
Chief.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.241
- Hey, bro.
— Nice to see you, man.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.616
— What you doing out here in the east?
— Trying to get with your boss.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.243
Apparently, I gotta go everywhere he go.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.042
Any given moment,
we're all over the city, you know?

28:37.174 --> 28:39.165
— Uh—huh.
— Tryin' to help folk get back.

28:39.302 --> 28:42.135
— Some are getting back faster than others.
- Yeah.

28:42.263 --> 28:45.630
Amazing thing about the Vietnamese
is that they're doing it on their own.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.893
They're not getting help from anybody.

28:48.019 --> 28:51.261
And still your boss is down here
to share some of the credit, huh?

28:51.397 --> 28:54.480
You upset about something, Chief?

28:54.609 --> 28:57.772
Y'all need to open up Calliope or Lafitte.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.691
My people want to come on back home
before Mardi Gras.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.734
You open up just a few of them buildings

29:02.867 --> 29:05.654
— and we'll take care of the rest.
— Projects are federal.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.994
That don't mean y'all can't press 'em
to do the right thing.

29:09.123 --> 29:12.206
I mean, lwouldn't mind seeing
a little something from y'all

29:12.335 --> 29:14.291
about getting our people back home too.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.411
(Singleton) Chief?

29:16.547 --> 29:18.333
— Chief.
- Ron.

29:18.466 --> 29:20.047
Good to see you. Eric, you ready to...

29:20.176 --> 29:22.667
— Can I talk with you, Ron?
- What's going on, Chief?

29:22.803 --> 29:26.762
My gang wants to come on back home.
But they need places to stay.

29:26.891 --> 29:29.348
- I understand.
— Now the projects sittin' there empty.

29:29.477 --> 29:32.344
They didn't flood, didn't blow over.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.812
Oh, Chief, wish I could do it.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.148
But you know that's not my call.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.901
Hey, you know my door's always open.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.567
Eric, make sure Chief Lambreaux
gets in to see me.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.280
— Yes, sir.
- Chief.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.638
Chief, I'll call you.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.849
Joint up the block usually
has some decent brass.

30:17.274 --> 30:21.392
At first when I am informed of your name,
I am uncertain.

30:21.529 --> 30:25.272
Alvin Batiste, trombone?
No, he plays clarinet.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.694
No, not old Alvin.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.035
You know, that's a whole 'nother world
of talent right there.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.700
From a computer, | find out

30:33.833 --> 30:37.075
Antoine Batiste
recorded with Preservation Hall

30:37.211 --> 30:40.078
and also a live recording
with Shannon Powell

30:40.214 --> 30:42.455
and Germaine Bazzle.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.424
These recordings I myself own.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.090
Your intonation is notable

30:48.222 --> 30:51.510
and your attack very satisfactory.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.928
You know, I can play some. Yeah.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.928
Ever since I hear the Hot Five's record

30:57.064 --> 30:59.441
You Made Me Love You,
l have been a jazz fan.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.432
Kid Ory will do it to you every time.

31:01.569 --> 31:04.436
No, Hy Clark played that number.
Just that number.

31:04.572 --> 31:05.732
Oh, Hy Clark?

31:05.865 --> 31:09.073
Yes! That album was my beginning.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.785
Then when I come first to New Orleans

31:12.913 --> 31:16.781
and I hear such good live music,
I couldn't believe it.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.580
After that, | buy every record
that comes to Japan.

31:20.713 --> 31:23.204
Your remember the Sweet Emma record
on Riverside?

31:23.340 --> 31:25.467
The Bell Gal And Her Dixieland Boys?

31:25.593 --> 31:27.879
Oh yeah, Big Eye Louis. He could play.

31:28.012 --> 31:30.799
(Chuckles)
Regrettably, I must again correct you.

31:30.931 --> 31:34.298
— It was Jim Robinson.
— What'd I say? Big Eye?

31:34.435 --> 31:36.596
Oh, no, you know I meant Big Jim.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.811
— (Laughing)
— After Katrina,

31:38.939 --> 31:41.476
every time | listen to those records, I cry.

31:41.609 --> 31:44.351
That's why my jazz group decided to come

31:44.487 --> 31:47.445
to do what we can.

31:47.573 --> 31:51.031
And we are glad that you are here.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.360
— Oh.
— Eh.

31:56.290 --> 31:59.623
A pawn shop?
This is unacceptable.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.458
Say what?

32:01.587 --> 32:02.827
Well, I would feel badly

32:02.963 --> 32:08.458
if I come all this way to purchase
a used trombone for you, Mr. Batiste.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.085
No, please, spare me no expense.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.469
Also we spoke of Big Eye Louis Nelson.

32:16.602 --> 32:20.094
I heard Big Eye at Preservation Hall

32:20.231 --> 32:22.096
with Kid Thomas Valentine.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.939
— Thomas Valentine?
— Yes.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.274
Yes, yes!
That was my first time in New Orleans.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.907
That changed my life.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.204
Eggplant, garlic soup, grilled shrimp.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.198
Got it, chef. Firin' 'em.

32:41.335 --> 32:44.293
Pork chop, mid-rare.
Pork chop, kill it, no sauce.

32:44.421 --> 32:47.208
Four pork, all day, mixed grill, sweetbreads.

32:47.341 --> 32:51.505
Four porks on, chef.
One left, then 86 the pork.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.470
— Only one more chop. Spread the word.
— OK.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.884
Sweetbreads, trout, trout.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.469
Four guys with a lot of attitude
just walked in.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.983
They're dropping John Besh's name,
but no reservation.

33:05.109 --> 33:06.849
Should I tell them 40 minutes?

33:13.200 --> 33:14.485
Holy Christ!

33:14.618 --> 33:16.825
Jacques, it's Tom Colicchio and Eric Ripert

33:16.954 --> 33:19.946
and David Chang and,
just for laughs, Wylie Dufresne.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.913
Squeeze them in table seven now.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.875
Besh fucked us. Fucked us good.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.167
Jacques, be thinking about
what the hell we're gonna cook these guys.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.083
Chef, so nice of you to call ahead.

33:32.219 --> 33:34.255
It was a last—minute thing.
We just got into town.

33:34.388 --> 33:37.596
We're doing this charity gig tomorrow
and John said we had to come here.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.511
— He didn't call?
- No.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.508
— John says hi, by the way.
— Right back at him.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.761
— Chef, let me introduce you.
- Oh, no need.

33:43.898 --> 33:46.935
Hi, Wylie, hello. David, hi.
Eric, hi. I'm Janette.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.443
— Pleasure.
- Tom.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.434
Well, l have a great table for you guys,

33:50.571 --> 33:52.562
if you want to follow me.

34:01.999 --> 34:06.208
— Looks like you're recovering nicely.
- Oh, looks can be deceiving.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.669
We won't be needing those, Louise,
thank you.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.708
We're psyched to be in your hands.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.923
And please don't be shy.
We are starving.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.668
Done. All right, chefs.
It is an honor to meet you all.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.931
— Have a good time.
- (All) Thank you.

34:21.352 --> 34:23.343
Jacques?

34:25.606 --> 34:27.517
What do you got for me?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.811
Smoked salmon around some caviar,

34:29.944 --> 34:31.980
seafood truffle stew, fingerlings,

34:32.112 --> 34:33.977
then the lamb off the menu.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.481
We can't out—New York a bunch
of New York chefs. We lowball 'em.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.280
We start with the sweet potato,
andouille shrimp soup.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.030
Then we get rabbit kidneys out the freezer.
They're tiny, they'll thaw fast.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.748
We skewer them with some
lardons of the Benton's bacon.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.994
Then we hit 'em with sweetbreads
and crawfish over grits.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.257
— You devious, devious woman.
- You think?

34:52.383 --> 34:56.672
How about this for the last plate? Still got
the braised lamb neck from the staff meal?

34:56.804 --> 34:58.795
You are my chef forever.

35:01.058 --> 35:04.767
Then I saw a picture with Armstrong
and he was playing trombone.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.637
— Pops? Trombone?
— Cash or charge on this?

35:07.773 --> 35:09.980
But a little trombone, like a baby.

35:10.109 --> 35:14.603
- That must have been an alto.
— No, no, no, no. Then I understand.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.990
— Slide trumpet.
- Ahh!

35:17.116 --> 35:20.358
- That's what it was.
— Yeah, slide trumpet. Yes, indeed.

35:20.494 --> 35:22.576
But it make no sense,

35:22.705 --> 35:25.993
because Kid Ory was in the photograph
with his trombone.

35:26.125 --> 35:30.368
Kid Ory? With the King Oliver band?
No, no, no.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.837
That wasn't Kid Ory, bro.
With the Creole Jazz Band? Hell no.

35:33.966 --> 35:38.585
— Yes, Kid Ory.
— Dawg, that was Honore Dutrey

35:38.721 --> 35:42.213
on the trombone in that photo,
I know the photo you talkin' about.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.465
— Honore Dutrey.
— Kid Ory.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.809
Read my lips, man, it was Honore Dutrey holding a
trombone in that picture.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.599
I know I'm right and you're wrong

35:49.732 --> 35:52.314
because I damned well named
my daughter after Honore Dutrey.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.149
Cash or credit?

35:54.278 --> 35:56.394
Or do you two want to take this outside?

36:40.407 --> 36:42.398
Whoo!

36:53.587 --> 36:55.794
Take a picture of that shit, my friend.

36:58.092 --> 37:00.959
Thank you for indulging me, Mr. Batiste.

37:01.095 --> 37:03.006
I can be... (Sighs)

37:03.138 --> 37:06.005
..exuberant
when | talk about music.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.890
No, man, that was my bad back there.

37:09.019 --> 37:12.557
I mean, damn, how you gonna
talk about me indulging you

37:12.689 --> 37:14.941
when I'm standing here
with a brand—new trombone?

37:15.067 --> 37:17.604
Well, this is my pleasure.

37:19.113 --> 37:20.899
You were here in Katrina?

37:21.031 --> 37:23.488
Oh, hell, no.

37:23.617 --> 37:26.609
I wouldn't be all the way out here
except for the storm.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.237
My Mid—City place
was under five feet of water.

37:30.374 --> 37:32.456
I've been here since.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.324
And your car?

37:35.254 --> 37:38.291
My car? No car.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.380
How can you get around?

37:40.509 --> 37:42.500
| make do.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.587
Hey, you want me to blow this thing?

37:46.723 --> 37:50.090
Oh. Well, that would be too much trouble.

37:50.227 --> 37:52.468
Oh, it's no problem. Hold on.

38:52.706 --> 38:55.789
Kid Ory, Struttin' With Some Barbecue.

38:55.918 --> 38:58.000
(Laughs) Note for note.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.709
Goodbye, Antoine Batiste.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.251
(Bills crinkle)

39:04.384 --> 39:06.545
Oh, no, man, you've done enough.

39:18.106 --> 39:20.097
(Chuckles)

39:24.738 --> 39:27.901
Put the lies flottantes in front of Ripert.
It's his favorite.

39:28.033 --> 39:31.446
— Colicchio said you can cook.
- What? How did he say it?

39:31.578 --> 39:33.193
I mean, exactly what did he say?

39:33.330 --> 39:36.117
He said it kind of offhanded, like,
"She can really cook."

39:36.250 --> 39:37.956
"She can cook"
or "She can really cook"?

39:38.085 --> 39:40.918
He said "really."
And the other guys, like, agreed.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.083
- What did they say?
— They were like, "Yeah."

39:48.095 --> 39:49.460
Jacques!

39:55.936 --> 39:58.222
— How was everything?
— Awesome food, chef.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.812
— Thank you.
— Rabbit kidneys, huh? Nice touch.

40:00.941 --> 40:04.604
- Benton's bacon, right?
— Yeah. I sprinkle it on my breakfast cereal.

40:04.736 --> 40:08.604
If you ever find yourself up in New York,
I'd love to return the favor.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.196
It would be my pleasure to cook for you.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.657
— Give me a call, really.
- All right, thank you.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.072
— C'etait vraiment delicieux.
- Merci beaucoup.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.911
Mon plaisir.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.156
Thanks again, you guys.
I hope you had a great time.

40:19.293 --> 40:21.659
— And thanks for coming in.
- Thanks, chef.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.581
You gotta throw a little French in there?

40:23.714 --> 40:27.457
- We're in New Orleans.
— Yeah, I know what you're after.

40:30.721 --> 40:33.007
(J‘ Marching band)

41:22.731 --> 41:24.596
So what's the occasion anyway?

41:24.733 --> 41:27.691
The occasion is they're coming home,
for today anyway.

41:27.819 --> 41:31.311
New Orleans is coming home, man.
Just watch and learn.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.525
(Man) Who's ready for another cold one?

42:14.658 --> 42:17.240
(Second man) I can't even taste
the beer with the smell of mold.

42:17.369 --> 42:18.825
Can't we meet somewhere else?

42:18.954 --> 42:22.697
The captains of Krewe du Vieux have been meeting at the
Mother-ln-Law since '96.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.289
We're not going anywhere, Donny.

42:24.418 --> 42:26.579
(Woman) Not after Miss Antoinette
was good enough

42:26.712 --> 42:29.374
— to unlock this lounge for us.
- Next item of business?

42:29.506 --> 42:33.465
Some of our subkrewes, they want some kind of
acknowledgement of the storm,

42:33.593 --> 42:37.677
a serious acknowledgement,
not that tongue—in—cheek thing we usually do.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.297
I'm most serious
when my tongue's in my cheek.

42:40.434 --> 42:43.141
How serious an acknowledgement
are we talking about here?

42:43.270 --> 42:46.808
Well, like a riderless horse
at the head of the parade.

42:46.940 --> 42:50.808
The sacred purpose of Krewe du Vieux
is to mock the serious.

42:50.944 --> 42:54.562
- Vote.
— All in favor of a serious acknowledgement

42:54.698 --> 42:57.189
at the head of this year's
Krewe du Vieux parade?

42:57.325 --> 42:58.906
- No.
— Yes.

42:59.035 --> 43:00.445
— No.
— No.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.444
No.

43:08.128 --> 43:11.461
K—Doe abstains. The motion fails.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.581
— (Parade passing)
— Here they come. Captain?

43:13.717 --> 43:16.504
A respite to appreciate the second line?

43:16.636 --> 43:17.625
(Woman) Yes!

43:26.730 --> 43:28.015
Jesus.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.605
Hey!

43:32.819 --> 43:35.151
(Laughing)

43:37.407 --> 43:38.908
Wow!

43:42.287 --> 43:43.823
Oh!

43:45.165 --> 43:48.373
— How's it going?
— It's beautiful, no problems.

43:48.502 --> 43:50.538
The cops are a little freaked out
by the numbers,

43:50.670 --> 43:53.127
but I'm glad we got as many people
as we do volunteering.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.998
— Nobody expected this many people back.
— No.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.175
(Creighton laughing)

43:59.304 --> 44:01.545
This almost didn't happen.

44:01.681 --> 44:04.923
— This had to happen. It's great.
— Yeah.

44:05.060 --> 44:08.848
I'm gonna fall back and see
what's going on with the third division.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.361
(J‘ Drums beating)

44:24.746 --> 44:27.533
(Crowd cheering)

44:41.930 --> 44:43.921
(Ringing bell)

44:58.238 --> 44:59.853
(Woman cheering on)

45:01.032 --> 45:03.444
Oh, come on, VlPs! Go to work!

45:03.577 --> 45:05.693
Work, work, work!

45:05.829 --> 45:08.866
Work, VlPs! Work, work!

45:08.999 --> 45:10.614
(All chanting)

45:18.258 --> 45:21.045
- Kim!
— Whaah!

45:32.439 --> 45:34.805
Oh, my God, you made it!

45:58.381 --> 46:00.963
I'll be... I'll catch up with you.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.299
Go ahead, l'll catch up with you.

46:13.313 --> 46:15.053
Marcus, right?

46:16.316 --> 46:18.728
— Been wondering about my brother.
- How he doin'?

46:18.860 --> 46:21.602
Haven't heard from him since the storm.
You seen him?

46:21.738 --> 46:25.071
Me?
l was in Atlanta till, like, New Year's.

46:26.368 --> 46:29.952
ljust need to know, before the storm,
was Daymo back to using?

46:30.080 --> 46:32.366
Wasn't copping from me if he was.

46:32.499 --> 46:34.490
Last I knew, he let the shit be.

46:36.503 --> 46:38.539
That's it?

46:38.672 --> 46:40.754
I'm just trying to figure it out, you know?

46:40.882 --> 46:43.168
If I hear something,
you got the bar open, right?

46:43.301 --> 46:45.758
Yeah. Yeah, I been back a while now.

46:45.887 --> 46:49.254
Figured it was time for me to come back too, see what's
happening.

46:49.391 --> 46:50.756
Yeah.

46:51.518 --> 46:53.474
OK, then.

46:53.603 --> 46:55.218
Take it easy.

46:59.526 --> 47:01.858
— (Man barking)
— (Whistles blowing)

47:22.799 --> 47:24.505
Davis!

47:26.886 --> 47:28.877
Janette! Hey, babe.

47:29.014 --> 47:31.756
You won't believe what happened to me
at the restaurant last night.

47:31.891 --> 47:34.348
You will not believe this!

47:34.477 --> 47:35.933
— Check it out!
- What?

47:36.062 --> 47:38.053
Check it out!

47:48.283 --> 47:51.195
— (Woman) Yeah, I'm gonna follow him!
— That was different.

47:51.327 --> 47:53.943
Oh, man, don't even try to act
like it wasn't fucking awesome.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.321
The band was fucking on fire, man.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.699
- (Gunfire)
— (Woman screaming)

48:15.935 --> 48:17.926
(Woman) He's shooting!

48:21.316 --> 48:23.022
Annie?

48:24.527 --> 48:26.188
Annie?

48:26.321 --> 48:28.983
(Man) We got a man down!
Man down, man down!

48:29.115 --> 48:31.492
— Man down.
- Annie!

48:34.204 --> 48:36.320
For many it was a stark reminder
of a New Orleans

48:36.456 --> 48:38.242
many hoped Katrina had washed away.

48:38.374 --> 48:39.989
When the fuck did that happen?

48:40.126 --> 48:43.710
I didn't hear any gunshots.
l was at the whole second line, man.

48:46.758 --> 48:49.625
Three people shot.
You believe that shit?

48:49.761 --> 48:52.878
That's messed up.
That was a hell of a parade.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.972
Look like all the knucklehead shit
must be coming back to town.

48:56.101 --> 48:58.968
I can only quote Antoine Batiste.

48:59.104 --> 49:03.564
"New Orleans niggers
will fuck up a wet dream."

49:03.691 --> 49:06.819
You know, now the media
is gonna freak the fuck out.

49:06.945 --> 49:09.652
- The cops... Shit.
— (Man) Hey, white boy.

49:09.781 --> 49:13.945
They're just looking for an excuse
to clamp down on the second lines.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.068
Yo, white boy, what was that you said?

49:21.334 --> 49:24.792
l was saying that the cops
are gonna take this and run with it.

49:24.921 --> 49:27.754
Naw, that ain't what you said.
Say "nigger" again.

49:28.883 --> 49:31.169
What? Oh, bro, bro...

49:31.302 --> 49:34.089
No, | live in this neighborhood, so...

49:34.222 --> 49:35.462
Say it. I dare you.

49:36.558 --> 49:38.344
(Laughs) You dare me?

49:38.476 --> 49:42.219
- Davis, shut up, man.
— He just dared me to say "nigger."

49:42.355 --> 49:45.847
— What is that all about? Like I'm like...
— Sh. Sh.

49:45.984 --> 49:48.020
"Sh? Sh?" All right.

49:48.153 --> 49:50.860
All right, all right. OK.

49:54.784 --> 49:58.902
Just for the sake of discussion,
what's gonna happen if I...

49:59.038 --> 50:01.165
(Man) Oh, man!

50:01.875 --> 50:03.911
Come on, man.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.455
— Davis, you OK, man?
- Fuck off! Fuck!

50:12.969 --> 50:15.085
Fuck this!

50:17.223 --> 50:21.136
— Wait up, Davis.
— Leave me the fuck alone, man!

50:27.233 --> 50:28.894
(Distant car alarm)

50:39.037 --> 50:40.868
(Annie crying)

50:40.997 --> 50:43.033
(Sonny) Sh.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.415
(Classical music playing)

50:59.724 --> 51:02.090
Donald, he's conscious.

51:07.774 --> 51:09.639
How the fuck...

51:09.776 --> 51:13.485
We found you lying in the street last night,
just by our gate.

51:13.613 --> 51:14.978
Rough night?

51:15.114 --> 51:20.780
We thought to take you home,
but you had no keys. No wallet either.

51:20.912 --> 51:24.450
— Coffee?
— Uh...

51:27.835 --> 51:29.746
You guys brought me in?

51:29.879 --> 51:32.370
We're your neighbors.

51:48.564 --> 51:49.849
Yes, sir?

51:51.025 --> 51:55.610
What's the most trombone I can buy...
for that?

51:59.492 --> 52:01.357
The Conn, probably.

52:01.494 --> 52:04.327
Now is it for you or for a kid taking lessons?

52:04.455 --> 52:06.537
— Because you could rent.
- Nah.

52:06.666 --> 52:09.703
l have a hell of a horn right now, me.

52:09.836 --> 52:14.375
This is for a friend who lost his in the storm.

52:14.507 --> 52:16.463
Nah.

52:18.177 --> 52:21.419
What the fu...
Let me see that one right there.

52:39.365 --> 52:40.866
What does that say, bro?

52:41.784 --> 52:44.901
— "AB. '79."
- Mm-hm.

52:49.125 --> 52:51.241
"A.B." mother...

52:54.339 --> 52:56.421
You know I'm not picking that up.

52:56.549 --> 52:58.915
I'm taking this to the US Attorney's office.

52:59.052 --> 53:00.917
Those guys not only beat my client down,

53:01.054 --> 53:03.420
they took his property
to Carondelet Street for pawn.

53:03.556 --> 53:08.266
Never mind dirty.
I expect dirty in this town, but that's just stupid.

53:08.394 --> 53:10.225
Like they want to get caught.

53:11.481 --> 53:14.063
Toni, between the guys
who quit during the storm

53:14.192 --> 53:18.356
and the guys that we fired aftenNards,
I'm at 60% in this district.

53:18.488 --> 53:22.276
And the guys who are still on the job,
they got no homes, no money.

53:22.408 --> 53:25.024
Their families are living out of town,
most of them.

53:25.161 --> 53:27.777
Guys drinking, guys who won't
get out of their cars to work.

53:27.914 --> 53:30.872
Never mind some of them worked
two weeks straight after the storm.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.584
They were fucking heroes. Now they know
what the rest of the world thinks.

53:34.712 --> 53:37.749
They've seen the New Orleans police
on the news for looting,

53:37.882 --> 53:41.090
for beating on people,
for the Danziger Bridge Shootings.

53:41.219 --> 53:43.926
The guys who did this, it's...

53:45.515 --> 53:47.551
It's like a cry for help.

53:49.644 --> 53:51.680
It's all coming back, isn't it?

53:52.480 --> 53:54.596
For a moment the storm took it away.

53:54.732 --> 53:57.974
No dope, no guns. No guns, no bodies.

53:58.111 --> 54:00.477
— You know Cosgrove?
—Mm?

54:00.613 --> 54:03.150
The ASAC over at the FBI field office?

54:03.282 --> 54:04.488
Ah.

54:04.617 --> 54:05.948
He told me a story,

54:06.077 --> 54:08.159
came to him from a Houston homicide guy

54:08.287 --> 54:11.779
who locked up some New Orleans wonder
for a murder in that city.

54:11.916 --> 54:15.079
The kid does his 60 days in detention.

54:15.211 --> 54:17.418
You know, gathers his stuff up,

54:17.547 --> 54:20.084
calls for a guard, tells him that his time's up.

54:20.216 --> 54:22.673
It's time to let him go. Yeah.

54:22.802 --> 54:27.011
And the kid explains,
in New Orleans when you shoot someone,

54:27.140 --> 54:32.385
they hold you for 60 days and let you go,
which, let's face it, is pretty much what we do,

54:32.520 --> 54:35.227
given how fucked up
Eddie Jordan has the DA's office.

54:35.356 --> 54:38.894
Eddie's a joke, but his shop's
not the only one with problems.

54:39.026 --> 54:43.190
lam telling you, Toni,
the wheels are off the cart.

54:43.322 --> 54:46.189
Just like those two assholes
shooting up the second line,

54:46.325 --> 54:48.862
the crime is coming back.

54:48.995 --> 54:50.986
And we ain't ready.

54:54.167 --> 54:56.453
But you want to talk about a trombone.

55:58.356 --> 56:00.267
Hey, you.

56:00.399 --> 56:02.776
Oh, you're reading your old stuff, huh?

56:02.902 --> 56:04.767
Thoreau had it wrong.

56:04.904 --> 56:07.896
Most men live lives of quiet masturbation.

56:08.032 --> 56:10.739
— You're not gonna believe the day I had...
— My agent called.

56:10.868 --> 56:13.701
— She's coming for a visit in a couple weeks.
— Yeah?

56:13.829 --> 56:17.447
Carla said new opportunities,
new circumstances.

56:17.583 --> 56:20.199
- Lots to talk about.
— You sound thrilled.

56:20.336 --> 56:21.701
Good news comes by phone.

56:21.837 --> 56:24.704
When a New York literary agent
travels 1,000 miles,

56:24.840 --> 56:27.923
that means the publisher
wants their advance returned.

56:28.052 --> 56:30.964
l'm six years late on this novel.

56:31.097 --> 56:34.260
Random House is fed the fuck up
and wants their money back.

56:34.392 --> 56:36.929
— She said that?
— With the money we spent on the new roof

56:37.061 --> 56:40.098
and lowering our mortgage, guess what,
I got nothing to give 'em.

56:40.231 --> 56:41.892
- Creighton.
— What, Toni?

56:42.024 --> 56:43.855
What?

56:43.985 --> 56:45.646
(Laughing)

56:45.778 --> 56:48.485
That fuckin' agent's gonna ruin Mardi Gras!

56:48.614 --> 56:50.775
(Sighs)

57:05.298 --> 57:06.663
Sorry, bro.

57:06.799 --> 57:09.461
See you around, OK?
