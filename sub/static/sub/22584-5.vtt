00:02.360 --> 00:04.032
Previously, on Enterprise.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.833
Jonathan Archer.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.793
What brings you here?

00:12.640 --> 00:14.631
Someone attacked
a Klingon bird-of-prey.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.354
The entire crew was massacred,
the ship is missing.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.038
They were Augments.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.870
When you rejected our father's wishes,
you stopped being one of us, Raakin.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.599
-They're dangerous.
-They're the future.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.108
Father....

00:39.320 --> 00:42.710
Thousands of your brothers and sisters
are waiting to be born.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.398
Let's go get them.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.436
Some claim humanity rose up
against the Augments.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.597
Others say the Augments
began fighting among themselves.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.392
Whoever started it...

01:01.600 --> 01:04.592
the war devastated Earth.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.432
Millions perished.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.557
And when it was over...

01:11.800 --> 01:15.475
people like you were feared.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.116
Humans will always fear you.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.599
They fear your power, your intellect.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.910
They fear you because you're everything
they want to be but can't be.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.997
Which is why I brought you here,
where it's safe.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.716
I've raised you like my own.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.998
You call me Father.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.270
But I'm only watching over you.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.598
You belong to the future,
and someday...

01:49.440 --> 01:52.557
you will fulfil humanity's promise.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.880
-Malik.
-Are there others like us?

01:58.760 --> 02:02.673
Many others, waiting, asleep.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.992
And someday,
it will be your duty to wake them...

02:07.680 --> 02:09.079
set them free.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.797
We'll have to reach this sub-level.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.832
Security personnel are located
here and here.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.158
A direct hit to this power conduit would
demolish their life support systems.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.157
All we'd have to do
is wait a couple of hours.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.316
-No.
-But we could walk in unopposed.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.590
We're not going there to take lives.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.472
What if they don't give us a choice?

02:31.600 --> 02:34.876
No one is to be killed.
Is that understood?

02:37.040 --> 02:39.554
-Malik?
-Yes. Understood, Father.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.474
It's been a long road

02:54.960 --> 02:56.359
Gettin' from there to here

02:56.480 --> 02:58.198
It's been a long time

02:59.880 --> 03:03.031
But my time is finally near

03:03.720 --> 03:07.156
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

03:08.080 --> 03:10.514
I will touch the sky

03:11.040 --> 03:14.635
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

03:14.920 --> 03:17.639
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:17.760 --> 03:21.548
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:22.520 --> 03:25.159
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:25.280 --> 03:29.353
I've got faith to believe

03:29.920 --> 03:32.718
I can do anything

03:32.840 --> 03:36.594
I've got strength of the soul

03:37.360 --> 03:40.113
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:40.240 --> 03:43.789
I can reach any star

03:45.720 --> 03:47.790
I've got faith

03:49.400 --> 03:51.960
I've got faith

03:53.120 --> 03:56.317
Faith of the heart

04:07.160 --> 04:09.390
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.633
Dr. Soong and his Augments
have escaped on a Klingon bird-of-prey.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.753
Without any other leads...

04:15.880 --> 04:18.440
we've proceeded to the coordinates
Soong gave us...

04:18.560 --> 04:20.516
when we began this mission.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.392
Protein resequencer.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.633
Water purifier.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.315
Everything you'd need to keep
a small colony of humans alive.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.069
Looks like this place
doubled as a classroom.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.555
Imagine having Soong as your teacher.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.272
With that and their screwed-up genes...

04:51.400 --> 04:54.073
it's no wonder they turned out
the way they did.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.075
Trip.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.754
Interfaces.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.072
They look a lot like the ones we have
in our Sickbay.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.550
I'd say they took medical equipment
with them.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.513
I need to know exactly what kind.
It's important.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.710
I'll see what I can find out.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.914
We'll check out the rest of this place.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.719
I'll be damned.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.909
Hold it!

06:22.480 --> 06:23.595
Captain!

06:27.040 --> 06:29.554
-Leave me alone!
-We're not gonna hurt you.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.352
Get out of my way.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.518
We just wanna talk.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.634
Malcolm.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.558
See? We're friends.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.433
-Who are you?
-I'm Captain Jonathan Archer.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.113
We're from Earth.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.232
This was Raakin's.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.189
I gave it to him when he was five.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.992
He was a good student.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.518
He loved astronomy.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.158
We'd sit at night
and I'd point out the stars.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.637
He could name every one.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.797
Where's your brother, Malik?

07:40.280 --> 07:43.829
-I don't know what you've been told--
-No one will say anything.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.636
I only know he's not here.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.788
He's dead.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.148
Tell me what happened.

07:57.280 --> 08:01.068
He turned his back on your word.
He didn't want to liberate the others.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.640
What happened to him?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.028
I killed him.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.955
We were arguing.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.232
He pulled out a knife.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.909
I drew mine, he came at me.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.434
The next thing I remember
there was blood everywhere.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.152
It was an accident.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.075
I tried to save him, I tried.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.837
He was your brother!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.274
I'm sorry.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.316
Father. I didn't mean to hurt him,
I'm sorry.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.869
Malik.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.199
It's my fault.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.156
-I left you alone.
-No.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.431
I should have stayed with you.
You were just children.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.596
No, Father.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.148
I'm sorry.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.558
I'm so sorry, Malik.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.668
I'm sorry.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.838
He's dehydrated,
suffering from slight malnutrition...

09:16.960 --> 09:18.951
but otherwise, he's in good condition.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.719
For an Augment,
he didn't put up much of a fight.

09:21.840 --> 09:25.799
He isn't an Augment. He's an anomaly.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.349
His DNA is similar to the others,
but not identical.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.472
He was born
with none of their enhanced abilities.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.595
-How's the jaw?
-lt hurts.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.596
I'm sorry about that,
but you didn't give me much choice.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.352
I told you my name.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.632
My real name's Udar.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.268
But my brothers and sisters call me
"Smike."

10:01.440 --> 10:03.317
That's an unusual nickname.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.431
It's from Nicholas Nickleby.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.557
His handicapped friend.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.750
Is that why you were left behind?
Because you're different?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.150
I would have slowed them down.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.158
-Udar.
-Smike.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.632
I need to find out where they went,
the others.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.030
-I'm not telling you anything.
-I'm trying to help them.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.198
You're from Earth.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.995
You don't wanna help them,
you wanna kill them.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.793
-That's not true.
-I won't betray my brothers and sisters.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.993
Your brothers and sisters are in danger.
They attacked a Klingon ship.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.988
-lf the Klingons find them before we do--
-Then more Klingons will die.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.589
You'll never stop them, Captain.
No one will.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.351
Tucker to Captain Archer.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.754
Go ahead, Trip.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.316
The missing equipment?
They were incubators...

10:58.840 --> 11:00.398
artificial wombs.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.910
He's different than I remember.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.949
How?

11:11.960 --> 11:15.919
The man who raised us would never
risk our lives to protect a human.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.352
He knows the station.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.398
He used to work there.
He knows what he's doing.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.399
We'll find out.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.350
-You shouldn't doubt him.
-Why not?

11:27.480 --> 11:29.072
-He's our father.
-He's human.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.872
He's not like other humans.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.398
I used to believe that.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.876
You were leading us before.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.274
Now he is.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.435
-You can't accept that.
-Why shouldn't I lead?

11:44.560 --> 11:48.109
-Augments should be led by Augments.
-I won't listen to this.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.749
-Let me go.
-Don't be angry with me.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.831
I'm just thinking out loud.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.277
-I don't like what you're thinking.
-Then I'll stop.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.633
Stay with me.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.470
I think Soong is headed
to Cold Station 12.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.397
Isn't that where he used to work?

12:25.520 --> 12:28.637
It's a medical facility run by Starfleet
and the Denobulans.

12:28.760 --> 12:32.389
Highly virulent diseases are
stockpiled there for research purposes.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.990
It's the embryos from the
Eugenics Wars that Soong's after.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.117
-I thought Soong stole the embryos.
-He took 19.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.110
But there are over 1,800 more.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.710
That's why he took
the incubators with him.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.274
Why weren't these embryos
destroyed after the war?

12:49.400 --> 12:51.311
At the time, it was too controversial.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.034
Earth's governments couldn't decide
how to handle the issue...

12:54.160 --> 12:56.469
so they put them into cold storage.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.394
I just got off with Admiral Forrest.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.629
We've been authorised to use whatever
force necessary to stop Soong.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.832
-I need all the speed you can give me.
-You'll have it.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.436
This is cargo ship Corsair, repeat.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.120
Medical emergency. Situation is critical.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.470
Corsair, this is Barzai,
a Denobulan medical ship.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.955
-What's the nature of your emergency?
-Reactor leak.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.640
Ten crewmen exposed
to delta radiation.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.077
I have a fix.
I'm about six minutes away from you.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.116
Barzai, stand down
and prepare to be boarded.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.634
How's the patient?

14:01.760 --> 14:03.716
He's doing fine, ready to be discharged.

14:03.840 --> 14:04.829
Good.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.833
I just reviewed the crew manifest
for C-12.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.835
One of the names is Dr. Jeremy Lucas.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.830
He's Senior Medical Director.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.957
In his last correspondence,
he mentioned he was being transferred.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.038
-He didn't say where.
-I thought you should know.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.233
I appreciate it.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.349
Captain.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.796
I spent a few months at C-12 myself.

14:32.920 --> 14:36.071
I know the security protocols.
I'm familiar with the technology.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.953
I'd like to be included
in the landing party.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.279
-Consider it done.
-Thank you.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.477
Phlox tells me
he's ready to free up this bio-bed.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.993
So I've been told.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.792
If you've had enough Sickbay food...

14:53.920 --> 14:56.434
I'd like you to join me
in the Captain's Mess.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.630
-Do I have a choice?
-No.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.038
See you in an hour.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.518
Cold Station 12, this is medical ship
Barzai, transmitting security code.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.075
Barzai, we are currently
on heightened alert.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.237
Slow to one-quarter impulse
and transmit security code.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.999
Transmitting.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.390
Code confirmed.
You're clear to proceed.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.110
Why are you flying a Denobulan shuttle?

15:41.240 --> 15:42.355
Why not?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.238
You aren't Denobulan.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.559
That's true.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.788
-We don't have enough masks.
-You don't need masks.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.274
Dr. Lucas--

16:26.400 --> 16:30.439
I asked you never to bother me when
I'm watching a viropathic cytolysis.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.391
Our defence protocols just came on.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.956
-Did you contact Security?
-I can't reach them. The comm's down.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.635
The system's been taken off-line.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.749
Doctor!

16:48.200 --> 16:49.792
What the hell?

17:10.359 --> 17:14.114
Phlox tells me you've been living
on your own for quite a while.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.797
I left the camp about a year ago.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.356
You must be pretty resourceful
to survive by yourself out there.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.438
It wasn't that hard.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.429
Didn't look like a very friendly planet.

17:25.839 --> 17:29.276
When you get back to Earth,
you should consider going to school.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.359
-School?
-You've got a lot of catching up to do.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.074
How can I go to school if I'm in prison?

17:39.480 --> 17:42.153
What makes you think
you're going to prison?

17:42.280 --> 17:43.713
I'm an Augment.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.358
I don't know what you've been told
about Earth.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.311
You're not gonna be punished.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.270
That's not what my father said.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.677
Soong is not your father.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.718
What do you mean?

18:01.360 --> 18:05.319
Your biological father
was Miklos Karlovassi.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.356
He was a geophysicist.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.759
How do you know that?

18:12.880 --> 18:15.678
We got the information
from Soong's computer.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.756
Your mother's name was lrina.

18:23.400 --> 18:28.030
She was an athlete, decathlon,
won a silver medal in the Olympics.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.237
We've got a lot of historical data
on both your parents.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.077
You're welcome to look at it.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.755
Coffee.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.509
I'm approaching a new sleep cycle.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.110
-When does your hibernation begin?
-Not for another few weeks.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.676
But I would like to increase
my body mass by at least 10%.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.795
To tell you the truth, I'm not very hungry.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.797
You're worried about Dr. Lucas?

19:13.920 --> 19:16.275
We've been friends a very long time.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.469
We're getting there
as fast as we can, Phlox.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.828
You might be interested to know...

19:20.960 --> 19:23.235
Smike's become quite the student
of Earth history.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.954
He's been reading up
on the Eugenics Wars.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.715
I doubt Soong gave him the whole story.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.549
I'm quite familiar
with the subject myself.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.516
Human intellect and human instinct
were out of sync.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.428
-So many people were killed.
-The official number was 30 million.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.755
Some historians say it was closer to 35.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.270
I can understand why
Earth banned genetic engineering.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.269
What do you know
about Clarke's Syndrome?

19:53.400 --> 19:56.597
It's a degenerative brain disorder
that afflicts humans.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.355
My father died of it when I was 12.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.834
I'm sorry.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.239
He had frequent pain, hallucinations,
he talked to people who weren't there.

20:06.560 --> 20:10.758
Often couldn't recognise me or my
mother. The last two years of his life....

20:12.560 --> 20:16.109
And you were thinking if genetic
engineering had been permitted....

20:17.200 --> 20:19.077
Maybe Soong has a point.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.476
I've had time to examine his work
more closely.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.068
I'm forced to admit
some of it's extremely inventive.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.997
He's really quite brilliant.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.232
It's a shame such a man
has to remain incarcerated.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.552
He broke the law.
That's why he was in prison.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.952
And that's why I'm going to make sure
he goes back.

20:40.400 --> 20:44.678
Denobula perfected genetic engineering
a long time ago...

20:45.400 --> 20:48.472
but you never came close
to destroying yourselves.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.435
Perhaps we were simply fortunate.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.348
Or maybe your instincts
had caught up with your intellect.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.918
Food's getting cold.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.197
I don't have the code.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.472
When I was Senior Medical Director,
I had access to those embryos.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.273
They changed the policy
after what you did.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.392
The access code can only be obtained
through Starfleet Command.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.795
-He's lying.
-I'm telling the truth.

21:19.440 --> 21:22.557
Do the lights in your office...

21:23.080 --> 21:25.036
flicker every now and then?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.800
Every two hours. Drives me crazy.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.513
Faulty power relay.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.154
You wouldn't believe how many times
I asked them to fix it.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.475
Ten years later,
they still haven't done a thing.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.589
Put him with the others.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.597
-Father--
-I believe him.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.951
-Tell me.
-It's a hexadecimal password.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.833
I'm creating an algorithm
to compute the possible combinations...

21:43.960 --> 21:45.188
a few hundred thousand of them.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.550
It may take a few minutes.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.120
I can't believe I held you back in math.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.678
A ship's entering the system.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.870
Range, 20 million kilometres.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.468
-Any sign of the bird-of-prey?
-None.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.515
They could be hiding behind
any one of the larger asteroids.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.352
We're being hailed.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.068
Put it up.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.272
Captain. I wish I could say
it's been a long time.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.710
This only ends one way, Doctor.

22:16.840 --> 22:21.038
I think you've underestimated
the variables, about 11 of them.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.310
No one will be harmed
if you leave this system immediately.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.275
I'm betting
you're not a cold-blooded killer.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.868
Turn your ship around now.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.079
I want proof
that the hostages are unharmed.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.078
Let me speak to Lucas.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.434
Go ahead.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.189
We're all right. No one's been hurt.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.352
That's about to change.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.668
You're still approaching this station.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.113
Do you have any idea
what a Klingon disruptor...

23:07.240 --> 23:09.834
will do to a human skull at this range?

23:10.240 --> 23:12.800
You're going to leave me
with an awful mess to clean up.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.909
Doctor.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.917
Conversation's over. He dies.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.349
All stop!

23:21.040 --> 23:22.519
Now turn around.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.239
Bring us about.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.398
That's a good Captain.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.632
There's another layer of encryption,
it appears to be on a quantum level.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.749
How long?

23:50.880 --> 23:53.474
Longer than I thought,
maybe a lot longer.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.114
-Keep working.
-He lied.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.996
Dr. Lucas, about the embryos.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.798
Station access log.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.154
Get him in here.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.551
I've modulated
the transporter frequency...

24:11.680 --> 24:13.318
to match the station's
containment fields.

24:13.440 --> 24:17.194
If you register at all on their sensors,
it'll look like a field echo.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.513
Do you really think I can help?

24:20.640 --> 24:23.279
If I didn't, I wouldn't have asked you
to come along.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.312
Captain, we're nearly out of
transporter range.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.309
Energise.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.839
Malik!

24:43.280 --> 24:45.589
I want to put an end to this, Doctor.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.393
-So do l.
-We know you can get to the embryos.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.512
You accessed the stasis chamber
just last week.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.711
That's a mistake in the log.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.599
I implore you.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.230
Give us what we came for,
and we'll leave you in peace.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.039
What's that?

25:07.320 --> 25:10.278
That language is unbecoming
of a man of science.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.595
Father.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.119
Some men are braver
with their own lives...

25:17.240 --> 25:19.754
than they are with the lives of others.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.632
-Bring in one of his colleagues.
-No, not here.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.714
In there.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.431
There are thousands of pathogens
stored here.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.118
-Some kill within minutes.
-No.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.356
The longer we're in this facility,
the greater the chance...

25:34.480 --> 25:37.233
that more ships will come, and they
might not back down like Enterprise.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.716
-lt isn't necessary.
-It's the only way to make him talk.

25:42.480 --> 25:46.837
Is one human being worth all our lives
and everything you've worked for?

26:08.720 --> 26:13.077
If that's what it takes to stun them,
what have you got to do to kill them?

26:24.160 --> 26:26.913
Are you familiar
with Symbalene blood burn?

26:27.560 --> 26:30.393
The vascular lining literally boils away.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.999
You son of a bitch.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.917
-Actually, Mother was a chemist.
-You can't do this.

26:36.040 --> 26:39.874
Believe me, I don't want to,
but I'm out of options, Doctor.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.149
The code!

26:48.640 --> 26:51.393
This is on your conscience, then,
not mine.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.315
No!

27:20.240 --> 27:22.708
Life support runs through this relay.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.990
How long before they run out of air
in the control hub?

27:25.120 --> 27:28.590
Half an hour. They should start feeling
the effects within 10, 15 minutes.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.234
We're not talking about
normal human beings here.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.157
Even an Augment needs oxygen.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.315
His temperature's rising quickly.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.436
Blood pressure's approaching critical.
There's still time, Doctor.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.358
Just say the word,
I'll release the anti-pathogen.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.518
There's a fluctuation in the
life support relay on Level 4.

27:52.640 --> 27:53.629
Go!

28:03.600 --> 28:06.114
Right about now,
his extremities feel like they're on fire...

28:06.240 --> 28:08.515
but it's the capillaries starting to burst.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.709
Watch.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.631
Please! Let me out!

28:16.680 --> 28:20.355
I'm asking you, one doctor to another.
Stop this.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.790
-I can't.
-ls it worth this man's life?

28:24.480 --> 28:28.155
-I have orders.
-I can save him.

28:33.040 --> 28:36.555
-How can you let this happen?
-How can you?

28:36.680 --> 28:38.113
Tell me the code!

28:39.640 --> 28:42.074
-The code!
-Go to hell!

28:47.200 --> 28:49.111
Release the anti-pathogen.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.311
-Father?
-Do it!

28:52.560 --> 28:53.675
No!

29:21.960 --> 29:23.359
That should do it.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.629
Smike?

29:28.640 --> 29:31.518
Dr. Phlox missed something
when he examined me, Captain.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.996
I do have one enhanced ability.
I can hear like they do.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.268
They're coming.

29:39.240 --> 29:42.516
He's wrong, Captain.
We're already here.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.795
There was a spike.
Then the signal was gone.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.912
Sounds like what happens
when a communicator goes down.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.393
To prevent us
from getting a transporter fix.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.632
-They've been captured.
-It's a logical conclusion.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.993
-We have to make sure.
-Agreed.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.794
-Jeremy.
-Phlox!

30:32.160 --> 30:34.720
-What are you doing here?
-Don't move.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.956
It's good to see you again.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.590
Am I going to spend the rest of my life
trying to get rid of you?

30:41.720 --> 30:44.678
You're going to spend
the rest of your life in prison.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.349
Udar?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.429
Father.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.717
How is this....

31:00.840 --> 31:03.991
They told me you were dead,
that you were sick.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.599
They lied to you.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.032
It was Raakin's order.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.951
-What was?
-Banishment.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.830
-Why?
-He wasn't strong enough.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.750
You all went along with this?

31:22.760 --> 31:24.637
Why are you so surprised?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.156
Whenever a group of people
start believing...

31:27.280 --> 31:28.679
they're better than everyone else...

31:28.800 --> 31:30.392
the results are always the same.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.600
-I don't need a history lesson from you.
-You need it from someone.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.430
-I don't need a history lesson from you.
-You need it from someone.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.758
It's Enterprise.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.269
We have your people.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.709
I asked you not to interfere.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.315
-Now--
-T'Pol! Execute your orders!

31:50.320 --> 31:51.594
End transmission.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.758
Bring up the data file.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.279
Enterprise.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.274
-Enterprise, come in.
-They cut us off.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.793
What are these orders?

32:04.920 --> 32:07.673
To initiate the station's
self-destruct sequence.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.317
In a few seconds,
this place will be dust.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.035
You'd kill us all,
rather than let the embryos be born.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.838
It wasn't my idea.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.790
The orders came from Starfleet,
but after seeing this...

32:21.200 --> 32:22.997
I can't say I disagree.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.070
We were defending our right to exist.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.079
You've already killed over 25 people.
Your existence has a pretty high price.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.474
It could get higher.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.192
The sequence is coming up.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.389
T'Pol?

32:37.320 --> 32:38.514
Proceed.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.393
Transmitting.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.996
Ten seconds to auto-destruct.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.991
It's some kind of feedback pulse.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.756
It's the signal we sent.
It's being amplified 1,000%.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.313
Comm's dead.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.352
The station's still there.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.391
It's safe to say
we're going to need another plan.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.512
-We'll destroy it ourselves.
-That thing's buried inside an asteroid.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.950
It's not the preferred solution
but it's all we have.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.437
Load photonic torpedoes.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.396
-Mr. Mayweather?
-Course set.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.354
Take us in.

33:28.640 --> 33:32.633
Looks like this place isn't turning
to dust. Sorry to disappoint you.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.908
They're friends. I heard them talking.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.552
Is this true, Doctor?

33:43.120 --> 33:44.712
Let's find out.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.512
-No!
-Leave him alone!

33:50.080 --> 33:51.149
Malik.

33:53.360 --> 33:57.239
You'll tell us what we want to hear,
or you'll watch him die, too.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.038
-5,000 kilometres.
-Lock weapons.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.799
-Starboard nacelle.
-Return fire.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.319
Stop. Stop!

34:32.800 --> 34:34.358
No! No!

34:34.880 --> 34:36.677
I'll give it to you. Don't kill him!

34:36.800 --> 34:38.438
I'll give it to you!

34:43.800 --> 34:45.233
Input the code.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.071
The stasis chamber is opening.
It worked.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.992
Get him out of there.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.033
You come with us.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.633
I'm gonna stay.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.553
I understand.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.430
I hope you have a long, happy life.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.753
You, too, Father.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.833
They fire, then move off.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.633
They're trying to draw us away
from the station.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.913
A few more like that, we're gonna be
a part of this asteroid field.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.553
Hold your course.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.793
Target the facility.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.038
They're beautiful.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.551
I came here so many times...

36:16.080 --> 36:17.798
just to look at them.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.273
I remember
where each of you was kept.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.592
You were there, right next to Saul.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.113
Persis, Yavar.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.552
It was so hard to choose 19
out of so many.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.469
Father?

36:46.760 --> 36:49.433
I never thought I'd see this sight again.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.795
We have to hurry.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.639
"Telurian plague."
I like the sound of that.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.875
What are you doing?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.468
Identifying the most
dangerous pathogens.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.678
You're taking them with us.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.030
Can't hurt to have a little insurance.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.397
They've been transferred
to the stasis modules.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.432
Take two people with you,
load them onto the shuttle.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.436
Get them in the containment cell.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.074
I wasn't sure how I'd justify killing you.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.950
Now you've given me
the perfect excuse.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.550
Whatever I can do to help.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.313
Hold onto that.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.596
You're a competent fighter...

38:08.760 --> 38:10.716
but that isn't good enough.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.750
I wish I had time
to continue our little match.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.519
I'm enjoying it,
but this will be almost as satisfying.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.117
Five minutes after we leave...

38:40.240 --> 38:43.152
every stasis field in this station
will shut down...

38:43.280 --> 38:45.475
releasing hundreds of pathogens.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.030
I wonder which one will kill you first.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.911
Stick around and find out.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.758
I like you, Captain.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.593
I can't allow my brother to die
in such a way.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.990
This will be much less painful.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.075
Smike.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.757
They're launching a shuttle.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.710
The bird-of-prey's moving to intercept.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.513
-Who's on the shuttle?
-Augments and one human.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.349
Soong.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.354
Fire torpedoes.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.399
-They've launched a torpedo.
-Maximum thrusters.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.548
Four minutes to containment breach.
There's no way to stop it from here.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.148
-Somewhere else?
-The primary junction.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.759
Where is it?

39:49.305 --> 39:55.632
