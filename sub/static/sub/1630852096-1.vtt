Great Elder, you have yet
to share your own perspective.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.466
We would value your words
immensely.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.215
Su'Kal is correct.

13:01.258 --> 13:04.131
There is no danger
of another Burn.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.785
Science is clear in that regard.

13:05.828 --> 13:10.964
I have marveled
these five months on Kaminar.

13:11.007 --> 13:14.924
Past generations of our species
lived in fear

13:14.968 --> 13:17.144
and hatred.

13:17.187 --> 13:21.365
We live now, together,
in communion.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.846
And while at times
we may struggle,

13:23.890 --> 13:27.894
I believe there is much we can
share with other worlds.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.549
Our-our duty is to our home,
is it not?

13:31.593 --> 13:34.596
If you define Kaminar,
alone, as "home,"

13:34.639 --> 13:36.163
it is, of course.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.818
But consider this.

13:41.298 --> 13:45.607
Here, we live, love,

13:45.650 --> 13:48.044
grow food
in the light of our sun.

13:48.088 --> 13:51.613
Uh, however...

13:51.656 --> 13:55.660
it is not... our sun.

13:55.704 --> 13:59.012
We share it with six other
planets in our solar system.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.885
A system which is one
of many in...

14:02.929 --> 14:05.018
a shared galaxy,

14:05.061 --> 14:07.281
Beyond our galaxy...

14:07.324 --> 14:10.501
space.

14:10.545 --> 14:14.418
In truth,
we are on an island together.

14:14.462 --> 14:18.031
We must ask ourselves,

14:18.074 --> 14:20.903
do we honor
our interconnection,

14:20.947 --> 14:23.950
or do we curl inward

14:23.993 --> 14:27.388
like a leaf pulled
from its tree?

14:27.431 --> 14:30.565
After the Burn,
that is what many chose.

14:30.608 --> 14:34.221
But this is a new era.

14:34.264 --> 14:37.050
Is it not?

14:37.093 --> 14:40.183
If you tell me you made a dress
uniform for Grudge, I'll stay.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.708
-Almost, all right? Almost stay.
-[laughs]

14:43.752 --> 14:47.625
No, you shouldn't miss your
nephew's Ikhu Zhen ceremony.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.063
A boy only becomes a man once.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.065
But this is a big deal, right?

14:52.108 --> 14:56.112
Starfleet Academy reopening
after 125 years.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.723
You introducing the president.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.900
Which you're not excited about.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.772
-Why would you think that?
-You got your growly face on.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.383
-I don't have a growly face.
-Yes, you do.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.908
You get that 11
between your eyebrows.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.911
BURNHAM:
Mm.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.738
[trilling]

15:13.782 --> 15:14.826
Oh.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.265
President Rillak is using
this moment,

15:18.308 --> 15:20.267
which should be
about the cadets

15:20.310 --> 15:22.922
and the people that fought to
bring the Academy back to life.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.706
She's doing what politicians do.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.490
Don't punch her in the head.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.884
I will do my best.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.194
I'm sorry
Saru's not here to see it.

15:34.237 --> 15:37.240
Yeah, me, too.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.677
It's okay.
He'll come back when he's ready.

15:39.721 --> 15:43.159
-Mm.
-And I will join you
on Kwejian soon.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.944
You know you got lucky today.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.642
-Luck is being ready.
-Oh, come on. We weren't ready.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.514
Are you seriously
complimenting yourself

15:50.558 --> 15:52.952
-for nearly getting us killed?
-It worked, didn't it?

15:52.995 --> 15:54.344
-Kind of.
-Mm.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.912
-See you soon.
-Okay.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.132
Be safe.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.919
Captain.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.542
BURNHAM:
Last year at this time,

16:18.586 --> 16:20.501
Federation Headquarters
was cloaked.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.025
The Federation itself
had 38 member worlds.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.245
Now, we have 59.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.943
And the cloaking shield
is nearly gone.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.163
There's no more need to hide.

16:30.206 --> 16:33.166
Today we reopen
Starfleet Academy

16:33.209 --> 16:36.038
for the first time
since the Burn.

16:36.082 --> 16:41.000
And in this moment, I feel like
anything is possible.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.480
You are tomorrow's ensigns,

16:43.524 --> 16:46.005
lieutenants, commanders

16:46.048 --> 16:48.268
and captains.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.313
And in this new world,

16:50.357 --> 16:52.924
all of you will go
where no one has gone before.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.101
And you will make the path
by traveling it.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.191
And from what I see,

16:58.234 --> 17:01.324
from what I see,

17:01.368 --> 17:04.066
I am honored
to be in your company.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.763
[applause, whooping]

17:05.807 --> 17:08.853
[whooping, whistling]

17:20.517 --> 17:23.999
And now, please allow me
to introduce our special guest,

17:24.043 --> 17:27.872
the new president of
the Federation, Laira Rillak.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.397
[applause]

17:36.968 --> 17:38.840
Thank you, Captain Burnham.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.757
Let me begin by acknowledging

17:42.800 --> 17:45.368
that today would not be possible

17:45.412 --> 17:47.631
without the USS Discovery

17:47.675 --> 17:52.114
and... your crew.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.551
Thanks to your efforts,

17:54.595 --> 17:57.467
we now have a vast supply
of dilithium

17:57.511 --> 18:00.340
we can distribute
to distant worlds,

18:00.383 --> 18:04.474
and we have reestablished
peaceful relations with planets

18:04.518 --> 18:07.086
that-- well, they were
antagonizing our members

18:07.129 --> 18:08.826
only five months ago.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.787
It's a lot to live up to.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.832
No pressure.

18:14.876 --> 18:15.920
[laughter]

18:15.964 --> 18:18.619
We are learning

18:18.662 --> 18:21.535
from the mistakes of the past,

18:21.578 --> 18:23.493
developing new technologies

18:23.537 --> 18:26.496
to reduce our collective
dependence on dilithium

18:26.540 --> 18:31.545
and continuing to rebuild
the Federation and Starfleet.

18:34.678 --> 18:38.813
Not that any of you
need the reminder, but

18:38.856 --> 18:41.468
one of Starfleet's
original missions

18:41.511 --> 18:44.123
was scientific exploration.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.560
And now that we are able,

18:46.603 --> 18:50.346
we are embracing that mission
once again.

18:50.390 --> 18:54.089
Cadets, if I may turn
your attention

18:54.133 --> 18:57.788
to the newly-constructed
Archer Space Dock.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.964
[gasping]

19:07.711 --> 19:11.193
Here, our existing fleet
will be upgraded,

19:11.237 --> 19:15.458
and the next generation of
Starfleet vessels constructed.

19:15.502 --> 19:19.201
Vessels that will once again
take us to new worlds,

19:19.245 --> 19:21.377
new civilizations,

19:21.421 --> 19:25.207
places you can't even begin
to imagine right now.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.520
Look up there.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.044
-Yeah.
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.394
Heard you guys had some fun
with the Alshains.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.962
Yeah. Might have to cover
your shifts more often.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.094
Ah. Don't get too cozy.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.358
I'm only consulting on the Curry
for another two days.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.837
It is a privilege
to be here.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.926
I wish I could
properly thank you all

19:48.970 --> 19:50.841
for everything you left behind.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.365
DETMER:
We appreciate that.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.105
Well, it was our duty,
Madam President.

19:54.149 --> 19:57.239
But still, 930 years
is a long way from home.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.720
From this perspective, can't
really get a sense of the scale.

19:59.763 --> 20:03.027
But later on...

20:03.071 --> 20:06.074
Hmm?

20:06.117 --> 20:08.555
Those cadets-- that feels like

20:08.598 --> 20:10.034
one thousand years ago.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.949
-Oh.
-And yesterday.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.734
Which is was, simultaneously.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.127
Did you know
there are people out there

20:16.171 --> 20:18.217
that don't have to put up
with space-time shenanigans?

20:18.260 --> 20:19.696
I bet they sleep great.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.569
-Mm. Good for them.
-[laughs]

20:22.612 --> 20:25.572
[Tilly laughs]

20:25.615 --> 20:28.836
"Lieutenant" used
to feel so far away.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.142
Is this about Osyraa?

20:31.186 --> 20:33.144
'Cause you deserve
that promotion, Tilly.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.234
-You all do.
-Oh, I know.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.192
I think, I...

20:37.236 --> 20:40.804
Captain, the admiral needs you.
It's urgent.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.201
NALAS:
This is Commander Nalas
from Deep-Space

20:46.245 --> 20:49.117
Repair Beta Six,
sending a request for help

20:49.160 --> 20:51.424
from any Starfleet vessel
that might hear us.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.077
I'm not sure what happened,

20:53.121 --> 20:55.297
but we just lost
reactor-control thrusters.

20:55.341 --> 20:58.605
Gravitational stability
is also compromised, and...

20:58.648 --> 21:00.215
That's all we got.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.435
-How long ago did this happen?
-Two hours.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.437
Whatever affected the station
also knocked out

21:04.480 --> 21:07.483
-the subspace relays
in the sector.
-Solar flare?

21:07.527 --> 21:09.877
Electromagnetic pulse could
have taken all systems offline.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.922
Haven't gotten any reports
of an EMP,

21:11.966 --> 21:14.708
but we'll check it out.
Kwejian is the nearest system.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.101
-I'll check and see
if they know anything.
-Can Kwejian help?

21:17.145 --> 21:18.668
VANCE:
We can't allow them to wait

21:18.712 --> 21:20.322
for a rescue vessel
to reach them at warp.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
Discoverywill go right away.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.326
Your mission is to repair
the station systems

21:24.370 --> 21:26.285
and to report back as soon
as you figure out what happened.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
Yes, sir.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.331
I'd like to join.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.812
See that spore drive of yours
in action.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.467
Madam President,
safety protocols.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.251
We can't put you at risk, ma'am.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.950
Well, thank you for your
concern, but I can't ask anyone

21:39.994 --> 21:42.344
for a sacrifice I'm not willing
to make myself.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.478
Ma'am, having you aboard
Discoveryheightens the danger.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.917
To my crew.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.833
I appreciate your passion,
Captain.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.096
I'll see you on board.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.968
[footsteps retreating]

22:03.147 --> 22:05.019
I know that look well enough.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.021
Admiral, she's trying
to prove herself.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.849
She wants to say
she's seen action.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.547
I think
she's ticking off a box.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.636
Captain,
this is a delicate time.

22:15.290 --> 22:18.598
We're all still learning what we
need as we grow the Federation.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.383
I'm pretty sure we don't need
politics as usual.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.342
Well, you may not like
to hear it,

22:23.385 --> 22:25.996
but an adept politician can be
a very powerful tool

22:26.040 --> 22:27.824
when the world feels
upside down.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.741
And the president doesn't need
your permission

22:31.785 --> 22:33.308
to board Discovery.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.399
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm...
I'm late for dinner.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.792
Sir?

22:40.054 --> 22:42.578
I'm so glad you were able
to bring your family home.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.368
See you when you get back.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.935
And give Mr. Booker my best.

22:54.373 --> 22:58.899
BURNHAM:
President Rillak
will be joining us.

22:58.942 --> 23:02.119
Standard protocols apply.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.340
Commander Detmer, take us
to safe range for the jump.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.081
-Black alert.
-Aye, Captain.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.911
Madam President,
you may want to brace yourself.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.608
The first one can be
disorienting.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.131
I'll be fine.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.656
Flew cargo ships
for my father back in the day.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.397
Okay.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.051
Jump.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.456
Owosekun, do we have

23:34.500 --> 23:36.502
-the station?
-I'm locked onto it,
but something's wrong.

23:36.545 --> 23:37.633
Onscreen.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.682
What the hell?

23:44.988 --> 23:46.512
What could have done that?

23:46.555 --> 23:48.905
-Definitely not a solar flare.
-Whatever it was,

23:48.949 --> 23:50.298
the station can't take
that kind of stress much longer.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.604
Neither can its crew.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.954
Yellow Alert. Let's get into it.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.491
[birds cawing]

24:09.535 --> 24:11.667
BOOK:
Wow.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.974
Kyheem.

24:14.017 --> 24:16.716
So much more beautiful
than I remember.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.805
[chuckles]

24:20.415 --> 24:22.417
Can you feel it?

24:28.379 --> 24:30.730
Oh, yeah.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.341
Hello, old friend.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.517
When was the last time
you saw it?

24:35.561 --> 24:38.999
Not since I became
a member of the pack myself.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.443
You do the honors.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.853
The World Root.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.158
Put your hand on it.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.638
The warmth you feel

25:09.682 --> 25:12.467
is a chain of a million hands.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.035
We do this to remember.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.820
We do this because
the universe is unknowable,

25:17.864 --> 25:20.301
but we can know this.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.870
You're now part of a chain
that goes back,

25:23.913 --> 25:25.915
unbroken.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.483

49:53.164 --> 49:55.993
to save the few.
Everyone could have died.

49:56.036 --> 49:59.039
-But they didn't.
-One day, they might.

50:01.215 --> 50:03.957
That is precisely
the kind of Pyrrhic victory

50:04.001 --> 50:06.916
Kobayashi Maru
trains you to avoid.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.397
-[comm chimes]
-BRYCE: Captain,

50:09.441 --> 50:12.487
Mr. Booker's here.
His ship arrived via autopilot.

50:12.531 --> 50:14.315
Something's wrong.

50:15.316 --> 50:17.057
BOOK:
Pull up Kwejian
on the deep-space array.

50:17.101 --> 50:18.493
BURNHAM:
What happened?

50:18.537 --> 50:20.495
My ship was hit by something.

50:20.539 --> 50:23.498
The stars.
Everything was warped.

50:23.542 --> 50:25.326
The gravitational distortion.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.806
But Kwejian is light-years away

50:26.849 --> 50:27.676
-from that station.
-OWOSEKUN: Captain?

50:28.895 --> 50:31.854
I inputted
Kwejian's coordinates, but...

50:31.898 --> 50:33.030
What?

50:33.073 --> 50:34.422
Nothing's there.

50:35.684 --> 50:37.556
You must've done it wrong.

50:37.599 --> 50:38.992
No.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.646
These are the coordinates.

50:40.689 --> 50:42.561
Widen the search radius.

50:44.780 --> 50:46.217
I see something,

50:46.260 --> 50:47.261
but it's hundreds
of thousands of kilometers away.

50:47.305 --> 50:48.697
Pull it up.

50:50.656 --> 50:51.874
[Burnham gasps]

51:13.809 --> 51:15.855
They're gone.

51:20.860 --> 51:22.862
[voice breaking]:
They're all gone.
