06:28.959 --> 06:31.792
WELL, THIS IS NOT
YOUR FAULT.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.792
NOW IF YOU NEED HELP
IN DEALING WITH THIS--
OH, NO, NO, NO. NO.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

06:34.834 --> 06:38.083
(chuckles) THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I FIGURE THINGS OUT.

06:38.125 --> 06:41.625

STAY FOCUSED ON THE PROBLEM,

06:41.667 --> 06:43.834
THE ANSWER WILL BE CLEAR.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.917
I NEED TO GET AWAY...

06:47.959 --> 06:50.417

06:50.458 --> 06:54.208
(scoffs) IT SOUNDS
SO EASY TO SAY, DOESN'T IT?

06:54.250 --> 06:57.834
WELL, IT'S TOUGH TO KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE READY FOR IT TO BE OVER.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.959
WELL, I BETTER
PULL MYSELF TOGETHER

07:01.000 --> 07:02.542

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT WAS YUMMY.

07:23.083 --> 07:26.041
AH! OOH, SORRY, MA'AM.
EXCUSE HIM.

07:26.083 --> 07:29.041

07:29.083 --> 07:31.542

THIS IS VIOLET. VIOLET, LISA.
HI.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.333
HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.959
HOW MANY WEEKS ARE YOU?
UH, 35-ISH?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.542
WELL, YOU'VE GOT THE GLOW.

07:40.583 --> 07:43.250
BEING A PARENT,
NOTHING COMPARES.

07:43.291 --> 07:46.000
SO I'VE HEARD. I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.875
SEE YOU LATER?
YEAH.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.417
OKAY. BYE.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.250
NICE. SHE'S, UH...

07:56.291 --> 07:59.250
I LIKE HER.

07:59.291 --> 08:01.125
(box scuffs against floor)

08:01.166 --> 08:03.333
(sighs) YOU NEED HELP
WITH THAT BOX?
(scuffs)

08:05.083 --> 08:07.041
HER HEART'S JUST NOT
WORKING ANYMORE?

08:07.083 --> 08:08.583
IT'S CALLED CARDIOMYOPATHY.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.792
THE HEART MUSCLE
BECOMES INFLAMED.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.083
IN THIS CASE, THE ADDED
PRESSURE ON JANINE'S HEART

08:13.125 --> 08:15.083
FROM THE BABY
CAUSED IT TO PROGRESS RAPIDLY.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.709
FROM ALL THE TESTS,

08:16.750 --> 08:19.166
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN
GOING ON FOR A WHILE.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.041
I'M AFRAID THAT THE DAMAGE
IS IRREVERSIBLE.
YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS?

08:22.083 --> 08:24.750
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
HONEY--

08:24.792 --> 08:27.083
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.
YOU'RE BLAMING ME FOR THIS?

08:27.125 --> 08:30.041
COME ON, STOP.
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.
(Addison) JANINE'S RIGHT.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.000
I THINK WE NEED
TO FOCUS ON THE SOLUTION.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

08:33.041 --> 08:36.792
(Noah) SHE IS GOING TO NEED
A NEW HEART.
(voice breaking) OH, MY GOD.
I'M GONNA DIE.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.917
NO, THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

08:38.959 --> 08:41.750
I'M PREGNANT
AND I'M GOING TO DIE.
HOW FAST
CAN WE GET A HEART?

08:41.792 --> 08:44.417
WE NEED TO NOTIFY U.N.O.S.,
GET HER ON A LIST.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.125
IT COULD TAKE TIME.

08:46.166 --> 08:49.750
HOW LONG CAN HER HEART
HOLD OUT?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL,
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

08:49.792 --> 08:53.125
THE PREGNANCY IS MAKING
YOUR HEART WORK HARDER,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.750
WHICH IS WHY, JANINE,

08:54.792 --> 08:57.750
I THINK THAT YOU NEED
TO CONSIDER TERMINATION.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.125
NO. (crying) NO.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.834
JANINE, AT 20 WEEKS,
THE BABY CAN'T SURVIVE,

09:01.875 --> 09:05.125
AND WE NEED TO RELIEVE SOME OF
THE PRESSURE ON YOUR HEART

09:05.166 --> 09:08.208
UNTIL WE FIND A NEW ONE.
SHE KICKS. SHE KICKS ME.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.041
SHE'S ALIVE IN THERE.
(sobs) PLEASE.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.583
WE CAN'T TAKE
THAT KIND OF RISK.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.291
JANINE, I WANT THIS BABY
AS MUCH AS YOU,

09:16.333 --> 09:18.667
BUT WE NEED TO BUY YOU
MORE TIME.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING, PHIL.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.709
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO LOSE THE BABY.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.083
NO, I CAN'T LOSE THE BABY.
YOU HAVE TO SAVE US BOTH.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.458
I'M BEGGING YOU.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.000
(siren wails)

09:29.041 --> 09:31.375
HEY, BOBBY.
BOBBY, IT'S DR. COOPER.

09:31.417 --> 09:34.041
MY BODY'S ON FIRE.
OKAY, YOU'RE HAVING
A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.417
SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO,

09:36.458 --> 09:39.417
SO WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN EATING?
I-I DON'T KNOW.

09:39.458 --> 09:42.041
BOBBY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TRY TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.208
LOOK, IF YOU TOOK SOMETHING
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.250
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
IN ANY TROUBLE,

09:46.291 --> 09:48.250
BUT YOU NEED TO TELL ME.
I...

09:48.291 --> 09:50.875
LOOK, YOU NEED TO CHECK HIM
FOR PILLS, CHECK HIS POCKETS,

09:50.917 --> 09:52.875
CHECK EVERYTHING
HE CAME IN HERE WITH.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.083
DRAW UP 125 SOLU-MEDROL
AND 50 OF DIPHENHYDRAMINE.

09:55.125 --> 09:58.041
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY? I'M
BOBBY'S TEACHER. I FOUND HIM.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.333
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
WHEN YOU FOUND HIM?

10:00.375 --> 10:02.667
HAS HE BEEN TAKING ANYTHING?
MRS. KEATING, THANK YOU.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.542
IS BOBBY OKAY?
OKAY, HE'S HAVING A SEVERE
ALLERGIC REACTION TO SOMETHING.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.834
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT.
HE'S IN HERE.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.667
YOU SHOULD GO IN.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.208
DONNA.
SAM.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.750
SAM?

10:12.792 --> 10:14.458
WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.250
MY STUDENT,
HE'S IN THERE.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.250
UH, THE SULFA YOU GAVE ME,
AND THE DOXYCYCLINE,

10:18.291 --> 10:20.709
I GAVE HIM BOTH,
AND HE'S REACTING.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.959
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE DOCTOR
WHAT HE TOOK.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.125
OH, NO. DONNA--
YOU CAN'T TELL THEM.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.333
YOU CAN'T TELL THEM
BOBBY AND I ARE...

10:27.375 --> 10:30.667
THAT I'M SLEEPING WITH
ONE OF MY STUDENTS.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.041
SHE'S NOT A VULTURE.
SHE'S NOT A PREDATOR.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.083
SHE--SHE WAS CONFUSED.
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY,
EXCEPT FOR THE BOY.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.583
HOW'S BOBBY?
HE'S, YOU KNOW,
HE'S STABILIZED.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.583
HE'S ALERT.
THE RASH IS NOT PROGRESSING.

10:43.625 --> 10:46.041
STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME?
YEAH, HE REACTED
TO THE SULFA.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.041
HE'S LUCKY.
PEOPLE CAN'T JUST GIVE

10:48.083 --> 10:50.291
OTHER PEOPLE
THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS.
SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.959
WHAT DID HE END UP
TELLING HIS PARENTS?
HE SAID THAT A FRIEND
GAVE HIM SOME PILLS

10:53.000 --> 10:54.792
SO HE COULD STAY AWAKE,
STUDY.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.417
NOW THEY'RE JUST HAPPY
THAT HE'S DOING BETTER.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.583
BOBBY IS A MINOR.
THIS IS STATUTORY RAPE.
SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE SLEPT
WITH HER STUDENT, ALL RIGHT?

11:00.625 --> 11:02.041
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.291
BUT HE'S GONNA BE 18
IN WHAT, LIKE, A MONTH?

11:04.333 --> 11:06.959
YOU SPOKE TO HIM.
IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.959
I MEAN, HE SAID HE MADE
THE FIRST MOVE, BUT--
OH, THAT DOES NOT
ABSOLVE HER,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.834
AND IT DOESN'T ABSOLVE YOU OF
YOUR LEGAL DUTY TO REPORT THIS,

11:12.875 --> 11:16.125
TO PROTECT HIM.
BUT IN A FEW WEEKS,
IT WON'T BE A CRIME.

11:16.166 --> 11:19.291
WHAT GOOD IS IT GONNA DO EITHER
OF THEM IF I REPORT THIS?

11:19.333 --> 11:22.041
SHE'S GONNA LOSE HER JOB,
HER CREDENTIALS.

11:22.083 --> 11:25.417
HE'S GONNA END UP HUMILIATED--
OH, HE'LL BE A ROCK STAR.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.458
MARY KAY LETOURNEAU--HOT.
THAT BOY WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.333
SO BY COMPARISON, SAM'S
PATIENT'S DONE NOTHING WRONG.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.041
WHAT--WHAT 17 YEAR OLD
HASN'T WANTED TO SLEEP WITH

11:34.083 --> 11:37.125
ONE OF HIS TEACHERS?
DONNA WAS IN A POSITION
OF POWER, AND SHE ABUSED THAT.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.125
WHY ASSUME A 17 YEAR OLD
ISN'T MATURE ENOUGH

11:39.166 --> 11:41.333
TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS?
BECAUSE HE'S BEING FORCED
TO GROW UP TOO QUICKLY,

11:41.375 --> 11:43.375
TO--TO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT HIS LIFE

11:43.417 --> 11:46.041
THAT HE'S JUST NOT READY
TO MAKE.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.041
THINK ABOUT YOURSELF AT 17.
I WAS MATURE, ALL RIGHT?
HEATHER WASN'T.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.250
BUT THANK YOU, NAOMI,
FOR THE FREE THERAPY.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.333
ALL RIGHT,
IF THIS WERE MAYA,

11:54.375 --> 11:56.959
AND A 35-YEAR-OLD
MALE GYM TEACHER--

11:57.000 --> 11:59.041
WELL, I WOULD KILL HIM,
BUT THAT'S NOT THE--

11:59.083 --> 12:01.083
LOOK, I KNOW THAT THERE'S
A DOUBLE STANDARD HERE,

12:01.125 --> 12:03.792
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN IT'S A GIRL. IT--IT IS.
IT SHOULDN'T BE.

12:03.834 --> 12:05.166
LOOK, I HATE ABUSE,

12:05.208 --> 12:08.041
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.417
DONNA IS NOT A CRIMINAL.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.667
NOW AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T
SEE HIM AGAIN,

12:11.709 --> 12:14.041
THAT'S ALL WE WANT,
ISN'T IT?

12:16.083 --> 12:19.792
EVEN IF SHE GETS THE NEW HEART,
HE WON'T LOOK AFTER HER.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.041
HE'S NOT GONNA
TAKE CARE OF HER.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PHILLIP?

12:22.083 --> 12:25.291
HE SENDS ME IN HIS PLACE.
WHO DOES THAT?

12:25.333 --> 12:28.041
EVEN NOW, HE'S IN THE LOBBY
ON HIS BlackBerry.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.041
THIS IS HIS BABY, HIS WIFE.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.667
HE SHOULD BE HERE FOR HER,
YOU KNOW?

12:32.709 --> 12:34.333
THERE STILL ISN'T A HEART,

12:34.375 --> 12:36.333
BUT JANINE IS AT THE TOP
OF THE LIST.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.041
I'VE ALSO GOT A CALL IN
TO THE HEAD OF U.N.O.S.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.041
JANINE'S BLOOD TYPE "O,"
SO AM I.

12:41.083 --> 12:44.709
IT'S THE MOST COMMON.
IT SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD.
THAT WORKS IN HER FAVOR,

12:44.750 --> 12:47.250
BUT ORGAN DONATION
IS A DIFFICULT PROCESS.

12:47.291 --> 12:51.250
SUPPLY CAN'T MEET THE DEMAND.
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING.
IF I COULD GIVE HER MY HEART...

12:51.291 --> 12:53.041
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU ONE.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.041
HOW LONG DO JANINE
AND THE BABY HAVE

12:55.083 --> 12:57.250
TO FIND A HEART
BEFORE THEY DIE?

12:59.291 --> 13:01.917
48 HOURS.

13:01.959 --> 13:03.250
(sighs)

13:10.709 --> 13:13.375
ISN'T THAT
SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB?

13:13.417 --> 13:15.458
I CAN'T STOP. NESTING.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.875
I SEE MESS OR CLUTTER
OR THINGS OUT OF PLACE...

13:18.917 --> 13:20.250
(exhales deeply)

13:20.291 --> 13:22.583
SO, UH, SHE SEEMS NICE.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.333
LISA.
AND HER KID IS CUTE.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.333
YEAH, I LIKE THEM.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.875
(sighs)
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

13:29.917 --> 13:32.792
I JUST--
I HATE IT THAT YOU'RE MAYBE

13:32.834 --> 13:35.792
CARRYING MY BABY,
AND I DIDN'T TELL HER.
DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD?

13:35.834 --> 13:39.375
YOU THINK I SHOULDN'T?
IT'S JUST... YOU'RE HAPPY.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.792
AND I'M ALL FOR
FULL DISCLOSURE,

13:41.834 --> 13:44.041
BUT DO YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TELL HER SOMETHING

13:44.083 --> 13:46.041
BEFORE THERE'S
ANYTHING TO TELL?

13:46.083 --> 13:47.834
VIOLET...

13:47.875 --> 13:49.917
OH, SORRY, PETE.
WERE--

13:49.959 --> 13:51.792
WERE YOU TWO
IN THE MIDDLE OF A...

13:51.834 --> 13:53.792
JUST FINISHING.

13:56.542 --> 13:58.834
ARE THOSE FOR ME?
NO, FOR ME,

13:58.875 --> 14:01.000
FROM A PATIENT.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.041
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.041
HER NAME IS ANITA. I STARTED
TREATING HER A FEW MONTHS AGO.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.959
SHE WAS PAINFULLY SHY.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.500
SHE WANTED ME TO HELP HER BE
MORE ASSERTIVE WITH A COWORKER

14:11.542 --> 14:14.208
SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH--
YOU KNOW, SHE--

14:14.250 --> 14:16.959
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO HIM.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.834
AND AS SHE REALIZED HOW EASY
IT WAS TO TALK TO YOU,

14:19.875 --> 14:21.959
SHE CHANNELED HER LOVE
TO YOU.
CLASSIC TRANSFERENCE.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.041
CLEARLY.
YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY IT LIKE THAT.

14:24.083 --> 14:27.041
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE A WOMAN COULDN'T FALL
IN LOVE WITH ME

14:27.083 --> 14:29.625
UNLESS IT WAS
A THERAPEUTIC MISTAKE.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.625
I CAN BE VERY CHARMING,
YOU KNOW.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.041
I KNOW.
WELL...

14:33.083 --> 14:35.959
I WAS JUST SAYING
THAT--THAT IT HAPPENS,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.417
THAT IT'S
PART OF THE PROCESS.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.458
ARE YOU HAVING
YOUR OWN FEELINGS?

14:41.500 --> 14:45.125
(chuckles) THIS IS NOT ABOUT
COUNTERTRANSFERENCE.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.166
I MEAN, GRANTED,
MY LOVE LIFE IS...

14:47.208 --> 14:49.792
AT BEST,
COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW,

14:49.834 --> 14:53.041
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO A COLLEAGUE,

14:53.083 --> 14:55.583
I GUESS, GO ON RECORD
IF NOTHING ELSE.

14:55.625 --> 14:59.041
BUT ALSO TO SEE IF YOU
HAD ANY... SECRETS.

14:59.083 --> 15:02.000
(sighs)

15:02.041 --> 15:03.625
I HATE TO FAIL.

15:05.083 --> 15:08.625
I THINK...
YOU WON'T FAIL.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.917
SHE'S--SHE'S LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU, SHELDON.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.458
AND CAN YOU
REALLY BLAME HER?

15:26.083 --> 15:27.959
(chuckles)

15:28.000 --> 15:30.875
UH, DELL,
I'M GOING OUT FOR LUNCH,

15:30.917 --> 15:32.875
SO IF MY 2:00 GETS HERE
BEFORE I DO,

15:32.917 --> 15:36.667
WILL YOU JUST PUT HER
IN A ROOM FOR ME?
WHAT ELSE WOULD I DO?

15:38.083 --> 15:40.667
DELL, LATER, WE'RE--
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TALK.

15:40.709 --> 15:43.041
A-AND I MEAN
A COME-TO-JESUS TALK.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.667
YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER, NAOMI.

15:45.709 --> 15:47.917
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MY BOSS.

15:50.959 --> 15:54.458
(whispers) EVERYBODY'S PATIENCE
IS WEARING THIN, DELL.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.000
WHAT?

15:58.041 --> 16:01.291
HEY. NAOMI WON'T PUSH THIS.
I WILL.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.166
LEAVE. TAKE THE DAY.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.000
GET IT TOGETHER, DELL.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.458
I'D JUST FOUND OUT
ABOUT BILL'S AFFAIR...

16:10.500 --> 16:13.041
FROM HIS E-MAIL.

16:13.083 --> 16:16.041
THERE WERE LOTS OF E-MAILS
FROM DIFFERENT WOMEN

16:16.083 --> 16:18.291
AND PICTURES.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.792
THEY WERE ALL SO YOUNG.

16:20.834 --> 16:25.000
AND I WAS FEELING OLD...
AND INSECURE.

16:25.041 --> 16:28.500
AND BOBBY?
HE JUST GOT TRANSFERRED
INTO MY CLASS.

16:28.542 --> 16:31.500
THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ME,
IT JUST... (sniffles)

16:31.542 --> 16:33.500
IT JUST MADE ME FEEL BETTER.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.291
HE'D FIND REASONS
TO STAY AFTER,

16:36.333 --> 16:38.542
AND I'D HELP HIM
WITH HIS HOMEWORK.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.750
WHEN WE WANTED A BREAK,
WE'D JUST START TALKING...

16:40.792 --> 16:42.208
FOR HOURS.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.500
(sighs)
I TRIED TO GET HIM TO FOCUS
ON GIRLS HIS OWN AGE.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.959
HE KEPT COMING BACK TO ME.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.500
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE THE ADULT.
YOU SHOULD'VE STOPPED HIM.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.417
I LOVE HIM.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.417
OH, LOOK, I KNOW IT'S WRONG,
BUT WHEN I THOUGHT SOMETHING

16:55.458 --> 17:00.041
WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL--
THIS IS A CRIME, AND WE
SHOULD BE REPORTING IT.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.166
YEAH, BOTTOM LINE--YOU--
YOU CAN'T SEE HIM ANYMORE.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.625
IF YOU DO--
YEAH, DON'T.

17:05.667 --> 17:09.375
OKAY.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.375
(engine turns over)

17:13.417 --> 17:17.041
(siren wailing)

17:17.083 --> 17:19.041
(sighs)

17:19.083 --> 17:20.959
(sighs)

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
(siren continues)

17:24.041 --> 17:26.125
I HATE HEART TRANSPLANTS.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.583
YOU'RE BASICALLY WAITING
FOR SOMEONE TO DIE

17:28.625 --> 17:30.583
TO SAVE THE PERSON
WHO YOU WANT TO LIVE.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.041
IT'S HORRIBLE.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.625
TO HAVE TO SIT
AND WAIT AND SIT--

17:34.667 --> 17:37.250
AND NOT BE IN CONTROL.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.041
YOU CAN
ONLY DO SO MUCH.

17:40.083 --> 17:44.083
AND IF, UH, YOU'VE GOT A BABY,
A BABY WHO COULD DIE,

17:44.125 --> 17:47.291
YOU'RE CONTENT TO JUST
CHALK IT ALL UP TO FATE?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.166
NO. THEN IT'S ON ME.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.041
EXACTLY.
(clears throat)

17:51.083 --> 17:53.041
WE ARE
THE ULTIMATE NARCISSISTS.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.041
LIFE AND DEATH
IS ALL UP TO US.

17:55.083 --> 17:59.250
NO WONDER SO MANY DOCTORS
ARE INSUFFERABLE.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.583
AM I?

18:02.625 --> 18:06.333
I THINK YOU'RE
ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.291
(pager beeps)

18:08.333 --> 18:10.000
(cell phone buzzes)

18:11.792 --> 18:13.750
WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM IN,

18:13.792 --> 18:16.625
I RECOGNIZED HIM
AND I PAGED YOU.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.458
IT'S PHILLIP,
JANINE'S HUSBAND.

18:24.166 --> 18:27.291
HE'S COMATOSE,
NO CORNEAL REFLEXES.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.834
TYPE 2 DIABETIC.
TOX SCREEN WAS NEGATIVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:29.875 --> 18:31.709
GLUCOSE WAS INITIALLY
LESS THAN 10.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.917
LOOKS LIKE
AN INSULIN OVERDOSE.

18:33.959 --> 18:36.917
E.E.G. SHOWS NO EVIDENCE
OF ANY BRAIN ACTIVITY.
HE'S BRAIN DEAD.
OH, MY GOD.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.875
DO YOU THINK...
(sighs)

18:38.917 --> 18:40.041
WHAT?

18:40.083 --> 18:42.667
HE'S AN ORGAN DONOR.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.709
CAN I HELP YOU?
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.875
I LIKE THE ATMOSPHERE--
OPEN, FRIENDLY, COMFORTABLE.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.875
(lowered voice)
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:04.917 --> 19:07.667
I-I TOLD YOU
I WAS NOT INTERESTED.
I FIGURED I'D CHECK OUT

19:07.709 --> 19:10.041
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
HOLDING ON TO.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.041
WELL, THAT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD IDEA, SO...

19:12.083 --> 19:14.041
BECAUSE OF
THE OTHER DR. BENNETT?

19:14.083 --> 19:16.041
I READ HIS BOOK.
DON'T WORRY.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.041
AS FAR AS HE KNOWS,
I'M A PATIENT.

19:18.083 --> 19:21.041
I DOUBT HE THINKS THAT I'M
TRYING TO GET YOU PREGNANT,

19:21.083 --> 19:23.375
AND, UH, YOU SHOULD GO.
LUNCH TOMORROW?

19:23.417 --> 19:25.709
(elevator bell dings)
(chuckles) YOU ARE PUSHING.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.166
I'M A MAN WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE WANTS.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.709
AREN'T YOU POPULAR
THESE DAYS?

19:34.750 --> 19:36.041
WHAT?

19:36.083 --> 19:38.709
THE GUY YOU WERE
JUST TALKING TO.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.333
OH, NO. HE'S JUST, UM,
HE'S A PATIENT, SO...

19:41.375 --> 19:43.583
GOOD NIGHT, SAM.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.542
GOOD NIGHT.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.959
(crying) I CAN'T...

19:48.000 --> 19:49.959
I CAN'T BREATHE.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.417
I CAN'T THINK.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.750
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITHOUT PHILLIP?

19:53.792 --> 19:56.041
JANINE, I KNOW THIS IS
UNTHINKABLY HARD,

19:56.083 --> 19:58.041
AND NONE OF US
COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.375
IT--IT'S AWFUL.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.375
BUT I NEED YOU TO FOCUS
RIGHT NOW.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.959
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS ON
THE BABY THAT YOU'RE CARRYING,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.959
THE BABY THAT
YOU AND PHILLIP CREATED,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.375
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THIS,
YOU BOTH COULD DIE.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.041
MY HUSBAND IS DEAD.

20:12.083 --> 20:15.041
AND YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
HIS HEART TO SAVE MYSELF?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.041
TO SAVE BOTH OF YOU.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.417
I CAN'T. HOW COULD I?

20:19.458 --> 20:23.041
JANINE, LISTEN TO ME,
IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE TO FATHOM,

20:23.083 --> 20:25.458
BUT THE HEART IS A MACHINE.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.375
A HEART IS TISSUE THAT PROVIDES
A HUGELY IMPORTANT FUNCTION.

20:28.417 --> 20:30.000
IT IS NOT YOUR HUSBAND.

20:30.041 --> 20:33.375
YOU'RE NOT TAKING FROM HIM.
HE IS PROVIDING FOR YOU.

20:33.417 --> 20:36.041
IT'S WHAT HE'D WANT.
YOU KNOW IT IS.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.792
PHILLIP'S DEATH IS TRAGIC,

20:38.834 --> 20:40.834
BUT IT'S GIVING YOU A CHANCE.

20:40.875 --> 20:43.792
NOW YOU NEED TO GET OVER
YOUR FEAR AND DO THIS,

20:43.834 --> 20:46.458
IF NOT FOR YOU,
FOR THE BABY.

20:46.500 --> 20:50.041
AND FOR YOU.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.500
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN
DIGESTED THAT,

20:52.542 --> 20:55.625
BECAUSE... I KNOW

20:55.667 --> 20:59.041
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.041
WE CAN'T SAVE HIM.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.000
WE CAN SAVE YOU.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.041
ONCE THE HEART'S OUT,

21:08.083 --> 21:10.917
WE'VE GOT FOUR TO SIX HOURS
TO GET IT IN.

21:10.959 --> 21:12.750
MONTGOMERY, BARNES,
HOLD IT.

21:12.792 --> 21:15.917
DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH HIM.
YOU'RE NOT REMOVING HIS HEART.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.917
HOW IS SHE? DONNA?

21:21.959 --> 21:23.291
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.333
YOU KNOW, WE NEED
TO FOCUS ON YOU.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.959
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU BETTER.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.291
I KEEP TEXTING HER.
SHE WON'T ANSWER.

21:29.333 --> 21:33.458
YOU KNOW, I GET IT, BOBBY.
PEOPLE FALL FOR THEIR TEACHERS.
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.041
I DIDN'T HAVE, LIKE,
A CRUSH ON HER OR ANYTHING.

21:36.083 --> 21:39.500
WE STARTED TALKING,
AND IT WAS REAL.

21:39.542 --> 21:41.041
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER

21:41.083 --> 21:43.291
TALKED TO A TEENAGE GIRL,
DR. FREEDMAN?

21:43.333 --> 21:46.083
IT'S LIKE DECIPHERING CODE.
THIS WAS A REAL CONVERSATION.
EVEN SO,
GIVEN THE AGE DIFFERENCE--

21:46.125 --> 21:48.917
WHY ARE PEOPLE
SO HUNG UP ON AGE?
(knock on door)

21:48.959 --> 21:50.125
DONNA.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.458
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.
I KNOW. I JUST...

21:53.500 --> 21:55.959
DONNA--
HEY, COULD YOU
GIVE US A MINUTE?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.625
UM, NO, I REALLY CAN'T.
PLEASE.

21:58.667 --> 22:01.041
WE HAD A DEAL.
I WANT YOU TO GO.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.917
MRS. KEATING?

22:03.959 --> 22:08.083
I JUST WANTED TO, UH, MAKE SURE
BOBBY WAS FEELING BETTER.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.917
DR. FREEDMAN,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

22:10.959 --> 22:14.041
NO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
SHE'S HERE TO SEE ME.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.208
I THINK YOU NEED TO GO,
DONNA, NOW.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.291
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT HIM.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.041
I LOVE HER.
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH OUR SON?

22:23.083 --> 22:24.625
(Cooper) LEAVE, NOW.

22:24.667 --> 22:27.000
I'M SORRY.
NOW.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.959
(laughs)

22:36.041 --> 22:38.333
(inhales and exhales deeply)

22:38.375 --> 22:41.250
WHAT?

22:41.291 --> 22:43.667
YOU KNOW THE WOMAN
YOU MET THIS MORNING--

22:43.709 --> 22:46.583
VIOLET--THE PREGNANT WOMAN?

22:46.625 --> 22:47.875
YEAH.

22:47.917 --> 22:51.041
WE'RE, UH,
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER,

22:51.083 --> 22:57.041
BUT... THERE'S A--
A CHANCE THAT IT'S...

22:57.083 --> 22:58.583
MY BABY.

22:58.625 --> 23:02.208
LOOK, I-I-I LIKE YOU,

23:02.250 --> 23:04.792
AND I WANT TO START THINGS
OFF BEING OPEN.

23:04.834 --> 23:07.667
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO THE FATHER IS?

23:07.709 --> 23:10.667
UH, YOU KNOW, UM...

23:10.709 --> 23:13.875
IT'S A LONG STORY.

23:13.917 --> 23:16.041
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

23:16.083 --> 23:19.041
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR A SINGLE MOM

23:19.083 --> 23:21.625
TO FIND A MAN WHO'S SMART
AND FUNNY

23:21.667 --> 23:23.667
AND... LIKES KIDS,

23:23.709 --> 23:26.583
SOMEONE WHO LIKES ME
AND MY SON,

23:26.625 --> 23:30.000
WHO DOESN'T JUST THINK
HE'S IN THE WAY?

23:35.709 --> 23:38.208
I LIKE YOU, PETE.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.417
THIS FEELS GOOD AND RIGHT.

23:41.458 --> 23:45.041
SO IT'S NOT
THE END OF THE WORLD.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.917
BUT I HAVE BEN,

23:46.959 --> 23:49.709
AND I HAVE TO PROTECT HIM.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.709
SO I GUESS WHAT I
REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS,

23:52.750 --> 23:55.000
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.208
WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT,
MONTGOMERY?

24:01.250 --> 24:04.041
WOMAN NEEDS A HEART,
CAN'T FIND ONE.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.500
SUDDENLY HER HUSBAND
DROPS DEAD. BAM, YOU GOT ONE.

24:06.542 --> 24:09.041
AWFULLY CONVENIENT.
YES, IT'S VERY COINCIDENTAL,
CHARLOTTE,

24:09.083 --> 24:11.500
AND PERHAPS WE COULD PONDER
JUST HOW COINCIDENTAL IT IS

24:11.542 --> 24:14.542
IF WE HAD TIME,
BUT WE DON'T.
HIS WIFE IS DETERIORATING.
SHE NEEDS THAT HEART NOW.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.041
IF WE WAIT, SHE'LL DIE.

24:16.083 --> 24:19.166
INSULIN OVERDOSE IS A WELL-KNOWN
CAUSE OF DEATH IN DIABETICS.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.041
ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE
OR ON PURPOSE?

24:21.083 --> 24:22.583
BECAUSE THIS HOSPITAL

24:22.625 --> 24:24.583
WILL NOT CONDONE SUICIDE
TO PROVIDE ORGANS

24:24.625 --> 24:26.667
OR BE PARTY
TO DESTROYING EVIDENCE

24:26.709 --> 24:28.041
IF IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.250
I WANT SOMEONE HERE
FROM THE M.E.'s OFFICE

24:30.291 --> 24:32.250
TO COLLECT TRACE EVIDENCE
FROM THE BODY

24:32.291 --> 24:35.875
AND FIND ME A CAUSE OF DEATH
BEFORE YOU TOUCH HIM.

24:35.917 --> 24:38.250
IF THAT MAN WAS MURDERED,
AND YOU DESTROY EVIDENCE--
WE DON'T HAVE TIME, CHARLOTTE.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.083
WELL, MAKE TIME. I'M NOT
LETTING A MURDERER GET AWAY

24:40.125 --> 24:42.125
JUST SO YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR HEART.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.834
(keypad beeping)

24:49.875 --> 24:51.375
(lowered voice) DONNA.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.041
YOU'VE GOT TO GO HOME.

24:55.083 --> 24:58.291
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T.
HE NEEDS ME. I NEED HIM.

24:58.333 --> 25:02.375
NO, THIS HAS GOT TO END.
NOW HIS PARENTS ARE...

25:02.417 --> 25:04.000
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

25:04.041 --> 25:06.041
I SCREWED UP, SAM.
YOU EVER DO THAT?

25:06.083 --> 25:08.583
YOU SEE THE TRAIN WRECK
AND YOU JUST KEEP GOING

25:08.625 --> 25:10.583
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU
FORGET... EVERYTHING?

25:10.625 --> 25:12.792
WE ALL DO,
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA TURN BACK.

25:12.834 --> 25:15.041
YOU GOTTA TURN BACK NOW.
(man) DONNA KEATING?

25:15.083 --> 25:18.041
YES.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR STATUTORY RAPE.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.041
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
REMAIN SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY

25:21.083 --> 25:23.166
CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.458
(camera shutter clicks)

25:28.875 --> 25:31.959
HE'S BEEN IN THERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR, CHARLOTTE.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.041
YOU GOTTA GET HIM
OUTTA HERE.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.542
YOU NEED TO WAIT.
HE'S DOING HIS JOB.

25:36.583 --> 25:39.125
(monitor beeping erratically)
HER PRESSURE'S DROPPING.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.959
(fetal heart monitor
beeping erratically)
BABY'S SHOWING SIGNS
OF DISTRESS.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.041
(Noah)
WE GOTTA DO THIS NOW.

25:44.083 --> 25:47.542
(beeping continues)
DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED?

25:47.583 --> 25:50.125
I'LL BE DONE SHORTLY.
YOU'VE TAKEN HIS BLOOD,
YOU'VE TAKEN PHOTOS,

25:50.166 --> 25:53.458
YOU'VE SCOURED HIS ENTIRE BODY.
CAN'T YOU GET THE REST
OF WHAT YOU NEED

25:53.500 --> 25:56.083
AFTER WE TAKE THE HEART?

25:56.125 --> 25:59.250
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.
CHARLOTTE?

25:59.291 --> 26:00.959
CHARLOTTE.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.250
(sighs) DO IT.

26:02.291 --> 26:04.709
LET'S GO.
(Noah)
I'M GONNA SCRUB IN.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.625
HAVE HIM READY FOR INCISION
IN THREE MINUTES.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.041
HEY.

26:18.083 --> 26:20.458
HEY.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.166
LOVE IS A BITCH.
FOR YOU
OR FOR LOLITA'S BROTHER?

26:24.208 --> 26:26.041
I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY,

26:26.083 --> 26:28.041
BUT, UH, I THINK DONNA
REALLY LOVES HIM.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.750
OH, TURNING INTO
A ROMANTIC?

26:29.792 --> 26:32.834
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A ROMANTIC.
(cell phone ringing)

26:32.875 --> 26:35.250
UH, Y--OH, NOW THAT--
THAT REALLY HURTS.

26:35.291 --> 26:37.709
OH, OKAY.
THAT REALLY HURTS ME.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.917
(beep)

26:38.959 --> 26:41.041
YOU CAN TAKE IT.
NO. I'M TALKING TO YOU.

26:41.083 --> 26:43.625
(elevator bell dings)
WHAT? IT'S--IT'S POLITE.
WHAT?

26:43.667 --> 26:45.458
OKAY.
(laughs)

26:48.917 --> 26:50.250
(doors close)

26:50.291 --> 26:52.875
WHO WAS THAT GUY
BY THE ELEVATOR LAST NIGHT?

26:52.917 --> 26:54.959
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.333
(scoffs) WOMAN, LOOK,

26:56.375 --> 26:59.083
I WAS MARRIED TO YOU
FOR 12 YEARS, ALL RIGHT?

26:59.125 --> 27:01.667
I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME.

27:01.709 --> 27:04.583
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO BLOW OFF
DUNCAN, I'M ALL FOR IT.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.583
JUST DON'T HIDE IT FROM ME.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.250
DUNCAN AND I ARE FINE.

27:08.291 --> 27:10.250
MM-HMM.

27:10.291 --> 27:13.500
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOOD...

27:13.542 --> 27:15.500
(sighs)
TELLING EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.500
WE'RE GOOD, SAM.
ALL RIGHT.

27:17.542 --> 27:19.500
WE ARE. WE'RE GOOD.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

27:19.542 --> 27:22.333
(bell dings, doors open)

27:22.375 --> 27:24.333
HIS AIRWAYS ARE CLEAR
AND THERE'S NO INDICATION

27:24.375 --> 27:26.709
OF ANY RESIDUAL DAMAGE
FROM THE ASTHMA ATTACKS.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.709
AWESOME. I CAN GO
TO SOCCER TODAY?

27:28.750 --> 27:31.041
OH, REST THE ENGINES, BUD.
NEXT WEEK, OKAY?

27:31.083 --> 27:34.417
(chuckles)

27:34.458 --> 27:38.125
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT PRESSURE
ON YOU LAST NIGHT.

27:38.166 --> 27:40.291
I JUST--I THINK
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

27:40.333 --> 27:43.959
AND YOU TOLD ME THE TRUTH.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.250
I JUST WANT THIS TO WORK.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.750
OKAY.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.208
OH.

27:59.250 --> 28:01.041
VIOLET. HI.

28:01.083 --> 28:04.041
HEY. I, UH, JUST CAME TO,
UH, CHECK UP ON YOU...

28:04.083 --> 28:06.041
(laughs) BUT, UH, WOW.
SHE REALLY LOVES YOU.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.041
YEAH. SHE HAS DREAMS
ABOUT ME.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.625
SEX DREAMS?
WELL, YES.

28:10.667 --> 28:13.625
I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING PROGRESS.
WE WENT OVER IT YESTERDAY.
(pop)

28:13.667 --> 28:16.625
OH!
BUT THEN ANITA SAYS THAT WE'VE
BEEN SO CLOSE FOR SO LONG,

28:16.667 --> 28:19.625
SHE CAN'T STAND NOT EXPRESSING
WHAT SHE FEELS ANYMORE.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.959
AND THAT IT
MAY SEEM CRAZY TO ME,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.208
BUT SHE WANTS ME BAD--
SO DAMN BAD.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.333
I'M QUOTING HER.

28:27.375 --> 28:30.041
THAT'S EXCELLENT, SHELDON.
(laughs)
NOW YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.041
NO. NO, SHE'S SAYING TO YOU WHAT
SHE CAN'T SAY TO HER COWORKER.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.250
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
GET HER TO TALK TO HIM.

28:35.291 --> 28:38.417
IF SHE HAS FEELINGS, AND SHE
DOESN'T TELL THE OTHER PERSON,

28:38.458 --> 28:40.792
IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.

28:40.834 --> 28:43.041
YOU KNOW WHAT, VIOLET?

28:43.083 --> 28:45.208
YOU'RE GOOD.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.208
CLEARLY SO ARE YOU.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.041
(chuckles)

28:49.083 --> 28:52.041
I'M SCARED.
(Addison) DR. BARNES
SAYS THE HEART'S TAKING.

28:52.083 --> 28:54.041
YOU CAN DO THIS, JANINE.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.041
YOU AND THE BABY
ARE GONNA BE FINE.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.041
IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S MALCOLM.

28:58.083 --> 29:00.250
HE'S BEEN THERE FOR ME.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.875
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER NEEDED,

29:01.917 --> 29:04.250
EVERY TIME
I'VE NEEDED ANYTHING.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.291
HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.917
WELL,
WHY DOES THAT SCARE YOU?

29:08.959 --> 29:10.375

29:10.417 --> 29:14.083

29:14.125 --> 29:17.417

OR SAID ANYTHING, JUST...

29:22.083 --> 29:24.458
PHILLIP IS GONE.

29:26.250 --> 29:29.834
AND I NEEDED A HEART,
AND THEN PHILLIP DIED.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.834
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK IT.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.834

WANT TO BELIEVE IT,

30:17.625 --> 30:19.041

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
PHILLIP'S BROTHER.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.834
NO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

30:26.875 --> 30:28.375

WILLIAM, I... (laughs)
I AM FLATTERED. I REALLY AM.

MY OWN FAMILY.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.333

3,000 MILES AWAY FROM THEM...

NOTHING'S WRONG...

MEANS EVERYTHING TO HER.

OH, SHELDON.
WHAT HAPPENED?

41:07.625 --> 41:10.458
ANITA THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
CONFESS MY LOVE.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.583
WHEN I INSISTED HER FEELINGS
WERE MISPLACED, SHE--

41:12.625 --> 41:14.917
SHE BEAT ME WITH THE ROSES.
IT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS GREAT?

41:14.959 --> 41:17.917
I FORCED HER, I PUSHED HER,
TO A BREAKTHROUGH, VIOLET.

41:17.959 --> 41:20.875
AND--AND WHEN SHE SAW WHAT
SHE DID TO ME, SHE BROKE DOWN.

41:20.917 --> 41:23.834
SHE REALIZED SHE SPENT
SO MUCH MONEY ON GIFTS

41:23.875 --> 41:25.291
FOR THE WRONG PERSON.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.417
SHE CALLED HER COWORKER
FROM THE OFFICE,

41:27.458 --> 41:31.083
AND TH-THEY'RE HAVING DINNER.
WOW. YOU SHOULD FEEL
SO PROUD, SHELDON.

41:31.125 --> 41:34.041
YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU GOTTA
PUT SOMETHING ON THAT.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.959
BUT THAT'S NOT THE BEST PART.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.959
THE BEST PART IS I-I HAD
A BREAKTHROUGH OF MY OWN.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.083
AND I REALIZED THAT
WHEN SOMEONE HAS FEELINGS

41:41.125 --> 41:43.333
AND DOESN'T LET
THE OTHER PERSON KNOW,

41:43.375 --> 41:46.041
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.
BUT I-ISN'T THAT
WHAT I SAID BEFORE?

41:46.083 --> 41:47.417
YES, AND I CONVINCED ANITA,

41:47.458 --> 41:50.000
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT IT--
IT APPLIED TO ME.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.375
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU, VIOLET,

41:52.417 --> 41:55.000
FROM THE FIRST TIME
WE RODE ON THAT ELEVATOR.

41:55.041 --> 41:57.834
I DON'T CARE
WHOSE CHILD YOU'RE CARRYING.

41:57.875 --> 41:59.875
I CAN TALK TO YOU
ABOUT ANYTHING.

41:59.917 --> 42:01.959

ABOUT EVERYTHING.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.166

NOT WITH YOU... I'M EMPTY.
