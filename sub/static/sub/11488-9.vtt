WEBVTT

00:01.217 --> 00:02.112
So, what do you want?

00:02.684 --> 00:05.884
Nachos, Red Hots, Milk Duds,
popcorn and a slushy.

00:05.951 --> 00:09.984
What are you doing,
building an ass bomb?

00:10.051 --> 00:11.051
Pick t.

00:11.118 --> 00:13.185
Okay, popcorn and Milk Duds.

00:13.250 --> 00:13.918
Fine.

00:13.984 --> 00:14.684
Large popcorn.

00:14.751 --> 00:15.984
Okay.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.484
But I'll still need a slushy

00:17.551 --> 00:19.584
so I don't choke to death
on a Milk Dud.

00:19.651 --> 00:20.918
All right.

00:20.984 --> 00:23.506
And ask then to put nacho cheese
on the popcorn.

00:24.517 --> 00:26.250
Oh, that reminds me.
I've got a date tonight.

00:26.317 --> 00:29.018
That reminds you?

00:29.901 --> 00:30.984
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
your help.

00:31.051 --> 00:32.217
My help?

00:32.284 --> 00:33.818
Next.
Hang on.

00:33.884 --> 00:36.951
Uh, a large popcorn
with cheese,

00:37.018 --> 00:39.951
a large slushy a a jumbo box
of Milk Duds.

00:40.018 --> 00:41.284
You want anything?
My treat.

00:41.350 --> 00:42.114
I'm okay.

00:42.114 --> 00:44.303
I'll just eat whatever lands
on the kid's shirt.

00:44.718 --> 00:46.018
You're gonna go hungry.

00:47.049 --> 00:48.884
That's it.

00:48.951 --> 00:50.185
So what about this date?

00:50.502 --> 00:52.584
Well, she got a friend
visiting from out of town.

00:52.651 --> 00:54.018
I said, "Fine," you know?

00:54.085 --> 00:56.718
Two's company.
Three's a sandwich.

00:56.784 --> 00:57.984
But for someeason,

00:58.051 --> 00:59.651
she insists on her friend
having her own date.

00:59.718 --> 01:00.984
So you're asking me?

01:01.051 --> 01:02.118
Yeah.

01:02.185 --> 01:04.018
The two of us out
making the scene

01:04.084 --> 01:05.150
with a couple hot chicks?

01:05.217 --> 01:07.185
Oh, Lord. Never mind.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.617
Don't be silly.
It'll be fun.

01:08.684 --> 01:09.617
We never double.

01:09.684 --> 01:11.350
That's not an accident, Alan.

01:11.417 --> 01:12.818
Come on.
Please, please, please?

01:12.884 --> 01:14.651
All right, all right.
Save your begging
for the date.

01:14.718 --> 01:15.851
I never beg.

01:15.918 --> 01:17.718
I grovel.

01:17.784 --> 01:19.284
Oh!

01:19.350 --> 01:20.984
I guess I'll have to find
a baby-sitter for Jake.

01:21.051 --> 01:23.284
I don't need a baby-sitter.
Nothing's going to happen to me.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.151
Who's worried about you?
I'm worrd about my house.

01:26.217 --> 01:27.451
It's $24.50.

01:27.517 --> 01:30.018
Whoa. Okay.

01:30.085 --> 01:32.617
Oh, geez!

01:32.684 --> 01:33.984
What?

01:34.051 --> 01:35.818
I walked out of the house
without my wallet.

01:35.884 --> 01:36.684
Can you believe it?

01:36.751 --> 01:39.551
Strangely enough, I can.

01:39.617 --> 01:41.584
$24.50, please.

01:41.651 --> 01:43.617
Hang on.
I know what happened.

01:43.684 --> 01:45.818
Because you drove,
it didn't occur to me
to pick up my wallet.

01:45.884 --> 01:48.584
The only reason
I drove was because

01:48.651 --> 01:50.984
you said your car
was low on gas.

01:51.051 --> 01:53.417
$24.50, please.

01:53.484 --> 01:54.517
Just a minute.

01:54.584 --> 01:55.818
You said you'd pay
for parking,

01:55.884 --> 01:57.417
which now you won't
be able to do

01:57.484 --> 01:58.884
because you forgot
your wallet.

01:58.951 --> 02:00.018
Don't make
a big deal of it.

02:00.085 --> 02:01.151
I'll pay for parking
next time.

02:01.217 --> 02:02.451
That's what you said
last time.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.417
Yes, but this time
I forgot my wallet.

02:04.484 --> 02:07.085
CROWD:
$24.50, please.

02:09.317 --> 02:11.918
Fine, I'll pay.

02:11.984 --> 02:13.684
Ooh, you know what?

02:13.751 --> 02:17.417
Why don't you throw in
a bagel dog make it an even $30?

02:46.180 --> 02:48.384
??
I are leaving now.

02:48.753 --> 02:49.862
Bye.

02:50.053 --> 02:51.619
I'm trusting you to act
responsibly

02:51.686 --> 02:53.186
and go to bed
at a reasonable hour.

02:53.253 --> 02:55.287
Okay.

02:55.863 --> 02:58.586
You know, this is a real
turning point for you.

02:58.653 --> 03:00.830
You're taking care
of yourself.

03:01.253 --> 03:02.686
You're becoming a man.

03:02.753 --> 03:04.466
You, too.

03:06.984 --> 03:08.586
Boy, it seems
like only yesterday

03:08.653 --> 03:10.619
that I was bringing you home
from the hospital.

03:10.686 --> 03:13.920
You were, you were like
a little wrinkly pig with colic.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.048
Yeah. You going or not?

03:18.586 --> 03:19.753
You ready?

03:19.819 --> 03:20.886
Hang on.

03:22.719 --> 03:24.986
Good-bye, my son.

03:25.053 --> 03:28.552
Save it for the date, Dad.

03:32.653 --> 03:34.452
Don't burn the place down,
and if you do,

03:34.519 --> 03:36.619
don't be here
when I get back.

03:38.020 --> 03:41.320
He knows to drink
the cheap Scotch,

03:41.387 --> 03:42.552
not the single malt, right?

03:42.619 --> 03:43.552
That's not funny.

03:43.619 --> 03:44.853
I'm not joking.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.186
He's probably just
going to mix it

03:46.253 --> 03:47.619
with Hawaiian Punch
anyway.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.220
Men.

03:51.086 --> 03:53.387
Oh, God, I am so full.

03:53.452 --> 03:56.053
I don't think I could put
another thing in my mouth.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.220
I'll bet just a
figure of speech.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.853
This is such a
beautiful restaurant.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.020
They don't have anything
like this back home.

04:06.086 --> 04:08.486
Really? They don't have
nice restaurants in Idaho?

04:08.552 --> 04:09.819
Oh, well, yeah, I mean

04:09.886 --> 04:11.920
we have a T.G.I. Fridays
and an Applebee's.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.986
But you never see movie
stars like we did here.

04:15.053 --> 04:17.653
Nina, they're just
regular people.

04:17.719 --> 04:21.153
And technically, I wouldn't call
Geraldo Rivera a movie star.

04:21.904 --> 04:24.419
Well, I thought
it was very exciting.

04:24.486 --> 04:26.753
And since I'm only in town
for the weekend,

04:26.819 --> 04:29.886
I think we should go
absotely crazy tonight.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.886
You two like to switch dates?

04:33.953 --> 04:36.153
Ooh, I'm up for that.

04:36.220 --> 04:37.287
No kidding?

04:37.353 --> 04:39.020
As long as we can
switch back.

04:39.086 --> 04:41.186
Alan, I believe it's time
we get the check.

04:41.253 --> 04:42.853
Agreed.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.320
Check, please.

04:44.387 --> 04:45.287
Be right back.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.419
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?

04:46.486 --> 04:47.753
To the lite boys' room.

04:47.819 --> 04:50.719
He means the little cheap
bastards' room.

04:50.786 --> 04:52.120
What's that, Charlie?

04:52.186 --> 04:53.020
Nothing.

04:53.086 --> 04:55.120
Excuse me.

04:55.186 --> 04:58.287
Back home we just call it
"the crapper."

05:21.153 --> 05:23.220
I thought you had
to pee.

05:23.287 --> 05:25.220
I did. I do.

05:25.287 --> 05:27.586
I am.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.753
Nice girls.

05:54.819 --> 05:58.020
Yeah, they're terrific.
Mm.

06:06.746 --> 06:09.048
(sighing)

06:31.086 --> 06:32.853
No matter how you shake
and dance,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.387
the last few drops
fall on your pants.

06:40.653 --> 06:42.997
Maybe you shouldn't
wear khakis.

07:03.517 --> 07:04.413
Uh-oh.

07:08.186 --> 07:09.853
What are you doing?

07:09.920 --> 07:11.253
What do you think
I'm doing?

07:12.861 --> 07:14.519
Amazing.

07:15.419 --> 07:17.886
This might take
a while, Charlie.

07:17.953 --> 07:21.320
All right, let's play.

07:26.452 --> 07:28.452
What, what
are you doing?

07:28.519 --> 07:30.552
What do you think
I'm doing?

07:31.608 --> 07:32.253
Okay.

07:33.309 --> 07:35.142
Hey, Alan?

07:35.209 --> 07:36.775
Yeah?

07:36.842 --> 07:39.309
This might take a while.

07:42.408 --> 07:43.554
MAN (on TV):
Where's Jennifer?

07:43.555 --> 07:45.920
GIRL (on TV):
She went into the caretaker's
shack to look for Cory.

07:45.921 --> 07:49.054
Okay, you stay here.
I'll go find her.

07:49.121 --> 07:50.654
No, I'm coming
with you.

07:50.721 --> 07:54.321
Will you people quit going
into the caretaker's shack?

07:56.388 --> 07:59.021
Cory, are you
in here?

07:59.088 --> 08:02.021
No, you idiot,
Cory's been dead for an hour.

08:03.455 --> 08:06.588
(woman screams)

08:06.654 --> 08:08.021
(cracking sound)

08:08.088 --> 08:10.121
Man, should have went to bed.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.455
(screams)

08:25.522 --> 08:29.054
Are you crazy?

08:29.121 --> 08:32.554
Well, there are several schools
of thought on that.

08:32.621 --> 08:34.888
So, your dad let you stay
by yourself tonight, huh?

08:34.953 --> 08:37.388
Why not? I'm old enough.
I don't need a baby-sitter.

08:37.455 --> 08:40.087
Okay. Well, th I'll leave you
to your movie.

08:41.455 --> 08:43.488
Wait, wait.
You don't have to go.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.622
Want a Pop Tart?

08:46.856 --> 08:47.854
Sure, why not?

08:49.743 --> 08:51.455
So, what do I need
to know?

08:51.522 --> 08:54.155
Well, basically when
a guy has half a face,

08:54.221 --> 08:56.455
you leave him alone.

09:01.522 --> 09:03.455
Charlie, you
still there?

09:03.522 --> 09:06.358
I told you
it might take a while.

09:08.269 --> 09:12.651
Well, I guess this train isn't
ready to leave the station.

09:12.988 --> 09:14.888
(toilets flush)

09:18.948 --> 09:20.054
You know what they say.

09:20.121 --> 09:22.555
Better to be on the
toilet and not have to go

09:22.622 --> 09:25.157
then to have to go and
not be on the toilet.

09:25.388 --> 09:28.321
Really? And
who says that?

09:28.388 --> 09:31.854
I don't know.
It's folk wisdom.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.555
Uh, the liquid soap
is a nice idea

09:58.622 --> 09:59.796
for the house,
don't you think?

10:01.588 --> 10:03.054
I guess.

10:03.121 --> 10:04.654
I mean, it makes sense
when you think about it.

10:04.721 --> 10:06.921
You know, you wash your hands
with a bar of soap,

10:06.988 --> 10:09.488
you're passing your germs
on to the next guy, but, uh...

10:09.555 --> 10:13.954
with the liquid soap,
it's not an issue.

10:18.593 --> 10:20.495
Good idea.
Mmm.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.888
I'll tell Berta
to pick up some liquid soap.

10:24.829 --> 10:27.221
Great, great.

10:32.388 --> 10:34.721
How funny is Berta?

10:35.851 --> 10:38.355
She is a pistol.

11:09.054 --> 11:10.721
Don't want to get
athlete's hand.

11:37.255 --> 11:39.787
Another good idea
for the house!

11:44.388 --> 11:45.455
Uh-oh.

11:45.522 --> 11:48.021
Don't even
think about it.

11:49.255 --> 11:50.555
Where'd they go?

11:51.402 --> 11:52.821
Your lady friends left
about 20 minutes ago.

11:52.888 --> 11:54.255
What? Why?

11:54.321 --> 11:57.321
They said something about
life being too short.

11:57.388 --> 11:58.388
Are you happy?

12:00.540 --> 12:01.522
All right, just
give me the check.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.888
Which you and I
will split.

12:02.954 --> 12:04.388
Not necessary.

12:04.455 --> 12:07.054
Mr. Rivera took care
of it before he left
with the ladies.

12:07.121 --> 12:10.455
I guess they'll find out how
"at large" he really is.

12:11.488 --> 12:13.522
Unbelievable.

12:13.588 --> 12:15.255
I know.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.164
We got a free dinner

12:20.919 --> 12:22.601
situation.... at 11:00.

12:23.626 --> 12:24.858
(loud bumping on television)

12:24.859 --> 12:28.699
(man screaming)

12:29.721 --> 12:32.603
Boy, college students
are really stupid.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.221
Yeah, if you shouldn't run
with scissors,

12:38.288 --> 12:40.921
you definitely shouldn't run
with hedge clippers.

12:42.921 --> 12:45.355
I can't believe I missed out
on a sure thing

12:45.422 --> 12:46.788
'cause I was sittin' on the can

12:46.854 --> 12:48.854
<i>listening to you
not take a crap.</i>

12:48.921 --> 12:50.021
You're actually blaming me

12:50.088 --> 12:51.221
because I had to go
to the bathroom?

12:51.288 --> 12:52.554
You didn't have to go
to the bathroom.

12:52.621 --> 12:54.255
You were just trying
to stick me with the check.

12:54.322 --> 12:55.554
Oh, oh, I see,

12:55.621 --> 12:57.422
so you know my bowels
better than I do?

12:57.487 --> 13:00.955
I will when I pull them out
through your nostrils.

13:02.988 --> 13:04.955
Well, I don't have
to listen to this.

13:05.021 --> 13:07.055
What's your hurry?
You see a check coming?

13:10.621 --> 13:11.688
What do you think?

13:11.754 --> 13:13.221
Should we watch
the rest of the movie?

13:13.288 --> 13:14.487
Might as well.

13:14.554 --> 13:16.355
I'm not going to
sleep tonight anyway.

13:18.355 --> 13:19.821
Leave me alone, Charlie.

13:19.888 --> 13:22.422
No, no, no, no,
let's get this
out in the open.

13:22.487 --> 13:24.288
There's nothing
to get out in the open.

13:24.355 --> 13:25.821
I had to go to the bathroom,

13:25.888 --> 13:27.355
and even though I don't have
as mucmoney as you,

13:27.422 --> 13:29.021
I was fully prepared
to split the check.

13:29.088 --> 13:30.621
Not quite 50-50 'cause, you
know, you had the better wine

13:30.688 --> 13:32.754
and your date had two
appetizers, but my fair share.

13:34.088 --> 13:35.221
What are you doing?

13:35.288 --> 13:36.688
What do you think?

13:36.754 --> 13:40.055
Alan, you can sit,
but you can't hide.

13:40.121 --> 13:43.788
I am going to shower
and get ready for bed.

13:43.854 --> 13:45.155
(shuts door)
You're kidding.

13:45.221 --> 13:46.821
You're just going
to walk away from me?

13:46.888 --> 13:48.721
Well, Charlie,
when you're being irrational,

13:48.788 --> 13:50.021
you leave me no choice.

13:50.088 --> 13:52.322
I'm not being irrational.

13:52.388 --> 13:53.322
(water running)

13:53.388 --> 13:56.587
You want to see irrational?

13:56.654 --> 13:57.688
Here's irrational.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.621
(screams)

14:09.721 --> 14:11.888
Great, My lamp.

14:17.055 --> 14:18.788
What the hell?

14:28.255 --> 14:30.454
I don't freakin' believe it.

14:46.721 --> 14:49.721
(water continues running)

14:59.221 --> 15:00.921
(doorbell rings)

15:00.988 --> 15:03.388
Charlie, the pizza's here!

15:07.955 --> 15:10.388
So it is.

15:14.521 --> 15:17.121
y, why don't I get this one?

15:17.188 --> 15:19.854
Hey, why don't you?

15:22.654 --> 15:24.221
What?

15:24.288 --> 15:25.754
No wallet?

15:26.788 --> 15:27.788
I'll be right back.

15:27.854 --> 15:29.121
I'll wait.

15:39.422 --> 15:41.088
Here you go,
Mr. Harper. $22.75.

15:41.155 --> 15:42.322
Thanks, Gordon.

15:42.388 --> 15:44.587
Hang on.

15:53.988 --> 15:55.521
Keep the change.

15:56.554 --> 15:58.221
Wow, thanks.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.221
Oh, Gordon, wait, w-wait.

16:00.288 --> 16:01.255
You got to hear something.

16:01.322 --> 16:02.487
Hear what?

16:02.554 --> 16:03.654
Shh.

16:05.088 --> 16:06.855
Wait for it.

16:08.812 --> 16:11.021
(Alan shrieking)

16:11.088 --> 16:12.754
Was that it?

16:12.821 --> 16:15.055
Yep.

16:15.121 --> 16:16.121
Thanks for waiting.

16:31.788 --> 16:33.155
Looking for something?

16:33.221 --> 16:35.921
Yeah, my... wallet.

16:39.821 --> 16:40.821
Here it is.

16:43.538 --> 16:44.857
Oh, oh, thanks.

16:44.872 --> 16:46.638
Wow.

16:46.705 --> 16:50.005
The legendary lost wallet
of Alan Harper.

16:51.039 --> 16:52.471
(chuckling):
Funny.

16:53.505 --> 16:56.271
(imitates creaking)

17:02.271 --> 17:03.705
Oh, my.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.938
There's no money in here.

17:05.005 --> 17:06.338
No?

17:06.405 --> 17:07.872
No.

17:07.938 --> 17:09.905
How were you going to pay
for the pizza, Alan?

17:09.972 --> 17:13.171
Uh, I-I have, um... uh...

17:13.238 --> 17:14.171
I have, um...

17:14.238 --> 17:15.471
What is it, Alan?

17:15.538 --> 17:17.438
What do you have?

17:18.471 --> 17:19.771
Nothing.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.505
You sure?

17:21.570 --> 17:23.171
Oh, where did you
find that?

17:23.238 --> 17:25.138
I mean, what is that?

17:25.204 --> 17:28.338
About $5,000
in small bills.

17:28.405 --> 17:30.938
W-Wow, wow, that much?

17:31.005 --> 17:32.924
A little less, since
I paid for the pizza.

17:34.005 --> 17:35.605
And tipped
the guy a 50.

17:35.672 --> 17:37.672
You gave him a $50 tip?

17:37.738 --> 17:39.139
Yep.

17:39.204 --> 17:41.663
Now I'm going to go light
my cigar with a hundred.

17:42.304 --> 17:43.238
Wait, wait, wait.

17:43.304 --> 17:44.238
Wait, wait, w-wait!

17:44.304 --> 17:45.471
I just remembered.

17:45.538 --> 17:47.039
I lost a big roll
of bills

17:47.105 --> 17:48.429
that looked a lot
like that one.

17:49.338 --> 17:51.204
Really?

17:51.271 --> 17:53.139
It's yours?
I had no idea.

17:53.204 --> 17:55.105
An honest mistake.
Gimme.

17:56.204 --> 17:57.605
You can understand
my confusion.

17:57.672 --> 18:00.072
I mean, a guy has got this
kind of cash laying around,

18:00.139 --> 18:03.005
you'd think he'd be
able to pay for his
own freakin' bagel dog.

18:03.072 --> 18:04.538
(sighs)
You don't understand.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.405
The money isn't for me.

18:06.471 --> 18:08.072
Really?

18:08.139 --> 18:09.139
Who's it for?

18:10.171 --> 18:11.705
Old Alan.

18:11.772 --> 18:13.238
Old Alan?

18:13.304 --> 18:16.505
Yeah, you know,
the Alan of the future.

18:16.571 --> 18:18.005
You're kidding.

18:18.072 --> 18:20.039
They're still going
to have Alans in the future?

18:20.105 --> 18:22.271
No, see,
the thing is...

18:22.338 --> 18:23.905
(sighs)
I've been going through

18:23.972 --> 18:26.338
kind of a rough
financial time since...

18:26.405 --> 18:29.872
well... high school.

18:29.938 --> 18:31.105
Anyway, it occurred to me

18:31.171 --> 18:32.738
that I could wind up
an old man

18:32.805 --> 18:34.371
with no one
to take care of me.

18:34.438 --> 18:36.705
I mean, who will Old Alan
be able to count on?

18:36.772 --> 18:39.072
Certainly not Jake,
'cause let's face it,

18:39.139 --> 18:40.972
his best hope
of a steady income is

18:41.039 --> 18:43.805
if missing the toilet
becomes a professional sport.

18:45.805 --> 18:47.772
So, I decided that

18:47.838 --> 18:49.872
whenever somebody
in the office paid in cash,

18:49.938 --> 18:53.371
I'd put it away
for... Old Alan.

18:53.438 --> 18:55.204
What about the IRS?

18:55.271 --> 18:57.672
What about 'em? They don't
care about Old Alan.

18:58.705 --> 18:59.805
Okay.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.905
Let me get
this straight.

19:01.972 --> 19:04.304
You're squirreling away
money for Old Alan

19:04.371 --> 19:07.139
while Young Alan sponges off
of Dumb Charlie.

19:07.204 --> 19:09.072
I-I-I wouldn't call you dumb.

19:09.139 --> 19:10.304
Sweet Charlie, Loving Charlie.

19:10.371 --> 19:11.571
Can I have my money now?

19:11.638 --> 19:13.538
You have a serious problem,
my friend.

19:13.605 --> 19:14.972
Yes, I do, no question.

19:15.039 --> 19:16.072
Now give me my money.

19:17.105 --> 19:18.304
You need help.

19:18.371 --> 19:20.304
I know, but who can afford it?

19:22.338 --> 19:23.905
All right.

19:23.972 --> 19:26.171
You know what I want you to do
with this money?

19:26.238 --> 19:29.114
Oh, come on, man.
I'm already constipated.

19:29.805 --> 19:32.005
You're gonna spend it.

19:32.072 --> 19:33.738
Every penny.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.104
But, but what about Old Alan?

19:37.105 --> 19:38.438
What will he do?

19:38.505 --> 19:40.838
Well, I'm guessing Old Alan
will be living

19:40.905 --> 19:44.358
on Old Charlie's hide-a-bed
until they bag him and tag him.

19:46.538 --> 19:49.421
Really?
You mean, no matter what,

19:50.204 --> 19:52.271
I can always count on you?

19:54.271 --> 19:55.405
keep the money.

20:08.072 --> 20:08.816
There you go.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.613
Enjoy your movies.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.880
Oh, hi, Charlie.

20:14.946 --> 20:17.547
Hey, bro.

20:17.614 --> 20:19.347
I'll take a big box
of Milk Duds.

20:19.413 --> 20:20.447
Sure.

20:20.514 --> 20:23.113
That's $25.

20:23.147 --> 20:25.480
Anything for
your lady friend?

20:25.547 --> 20:26.580
Nah, that's okay.

20:26.646 --> 20:29.080
She doesn't eat.

20:29.147 --> 20:31.447
Food.

20:31.514 --> 20:32.447
Keep the change.

20:32.514 --> 20:34.679
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

20:34.746 --> 20:36.213
I can always count on you.

20:36.280 --> 20:36.347
Come on, baby.

20:40.046 --> 20:41.813
Can you believe
I'm older than him?

20:44.679 --> 20:46.813
Boy, that's some hot chick.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.480
Yeah.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.614
Don't eat the popcorn, Jake.

20:54.679 --> 20:56.013
Sorry, Dad.

20:59.147 --> 21:00.580
