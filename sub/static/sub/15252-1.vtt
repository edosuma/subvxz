00:12.700 --> 00:15.166
MAN:
Morgan, this is a bad idea.

00:15.199 --> 00:16.433
MORGAN:
Well, we can't stay here, Chuck.

00:16.466 --> 00:18.500
CHUCK:
I'm uncomfortable with the plan.

00:18.533 --> 00:19.967
MORGAN:
Plan? What plan?
This is survival.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.533
(knocking on door)
That's her. We've
been compromised.

00:22.567 --> 00:23.700
I'm a ghost.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.400
Morgan, you can't
leave me like this.

00:25.433 --> 00:26.967
You can't do this
to me, man.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.034
Chuck, what are you doing?

00:29.066 --> 00:30.733
Uh, escaping.

00:30.767 --> 00:34.166
From your own birthday party?

00:34.199 --> 00:36.967
Wow, you look fan...

00:37.000 --> 00:38.400
...tastic.

00:38.433 --> 00:40.066
Uh, you know, sis,
the thing is,

00:40.099 --> 00:43.733
Morgan and I don't really
feel like we're fitting in...

00:43.767 --> 00:46.233
<i>at my birthday party,</i>

00:46.266 --> 00:48.099
'cause we don't know
anybody,

00:48.133 --> 00:55.700
'cause they're
all your friends

00:55.733 --> 00:57.099
Well, your jokes.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.733
Okay, my jokes.

00:58.767 --> 01:03.667
Chuck, I have invited
real, live women for you.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.166
So please... let's go.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.433
Morgan, you stay here.

01:08.466 --> 01:10.900
Need a hand,
buddy?

01:10.934 --> 01:13.433
No, no, no, I'm okay,
I'm all right.

01:18.233 --> 01:20.733
ELLIE:
Birthday boy, come with me.

01:20.767 --> 01:21.900
We're going to be social.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.867
You are funny, you are smart,
you are handsome.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.567
Thank you. Oh, there's
Captain Awesome.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.934
Please don't
call him that.

01:26.967 --> 01:29.034
Okay, I've identified
some candidates for Chuck

01:29.066 --> 01:30.199
and they are awesome.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.366
Let me introduce
you to Chuck-- Ellie's brother.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.066
Hi, Chuck.
We've heard
so much about you.

01:34.099 --> 01:37.433
Are you in
a costume?

01:37.466 --> 01:39.667
"Nerd Herd"?
That is so cute.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.633
What do you really want to do?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.066
Working on my five-year plan.

01:42.099 --> 01:43.400
Just need to choose a font.

01:43.433 --> 01:47.700
What happened here?
Did you hurt your hand?

01:47.733 --> 01:52.333
The controller chafes
after several hours.

01:52.366 --> 01:53.233
Yes, that's technically correct.

01:53.266 --> 01:54.900
I graduated in '02.

01:54.934 --> 01:56.867
What was
your major?
Engineering.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.900
Oh, my God, I knew
this great guy.

01:58.934 --> 02:01.166
He was an engineer, um,
he ran track

02:01.199 --> 02:03.633
and I think he was
a gymnast, too.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.600
Bryce Larkin-- he was
my roommate.
Oh, yes.

02:05.633 --> 02:06.934
What's he doing now?

02:06.967 --> 02:09.233
I think he's an accountant.

02:09.265 --> 02:12.900
(distant siren wails)

02:12.934 --> 02:14.034
(grunts)

02:21.600 --> 02:22.767
(shoes squeak)

02:24.133 --> 02:25.767
(frantic typing)

02:25.800 --> 02:27.300
(panting)

02:33.066 --> 02:34.166
It's hard to say good-bye.

02:39.366 --> 02:43.000
(male voice):
Security breach. Data vault.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.000
So, do you have a girlfriend?

02:55.034 --> 02:57.900
Uh, no... I did
a while back at Stanford.

02:57.934 --> 03:00.266
Oh.
Yeah.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.466
We met
freshman year.

03:01.466 --> 03:03.066
<i>Oh, that was a while back.</i>

03:03.099 --> 03:04.533
I remember

03:04.567 --> 03:07.000
when I met Jill, I was...
it was an economics class.

03:07.034 --> 03:09.133
I was walking
across the quad

03:09.166 --> 03:10.700
and she had dropped her bag,

03:10.733 --> 03:11.867
and I was like, you know,
rushing to...

03:11.900 --> 03:13.667
to go and pick it up for her,
and, uh...

03:13.700 --> 03:15.567
and we kind of, like,
did that whole, like, you know,

03:15.600 --> 03:17.700
kind of in a cartoon--
kind of bumped heads, and...

03:17.733 --> 03:20.333
There was a whole gang
of us-- Jill and Bryce.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.567
We had so much in common then.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.567
Ah!

03:25.600 --> 03:27.466
Not awesome.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.000
So there I was--

03:29.034 --> 03:34.733
Jill with Bryce,
me on a train home.

03:34.767 --> 03:40.166
(music playing)

03:40.199 --> 03:41.233
Larkin is in the vault.

03:41.266 --> 03:42.833
Larkin,
open the door!

03:42.867 --> 03:44.667
The Intersect Computer's
been compromised.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.733
Blow the door!
We can't let him go!

03:46.767 --> 03:49.633
Call for backup.
Larkin!

03:49.667 --> 03:51.433
(alarm blaring)

03:55.700 --> 04:01.233
(yelling)

04:01.266 --> 04:03.099
Freeze!

04:03.133 --> 04:04.466
Stop right there!

04:04.500 --> 04:06.767
(grunting)

04:06.800 --> 04:08.166
Larkin!

04:11.166 --> 04:12.700
(grunts)

04:12.733 --> 04:14.633
(alarm continuing)

04:21.600 --> 04:23.300
Cover right!

04:24.767 --> 04:27.600
(panting)

04:31.400 --> 04:34.034
Larkin, stop!

04:36.133 --> 04:37.466
(screaming)

04:37.500 --> 04:38.900
MAN (over radio):
Larkin is on the roof.

04:38.934 --> 04:42.133
All units converge. I repeat,
Larkin is on the roof.

04:42.166 --> 04:44.833
All units converge.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.867
(groaning)

05:05.034 --> 05:06.166
(grunts)

05:17.500 --> 05:19.366
Don't move.

05:22.233 --> 05:23.833
Too late, Casey.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.034
(sizzles)

05:36.500 --> 05:38.199
Thanks for
my party.

05:38.233 --> 05:43.066
Your seven-layer dip...
tasted like eight.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.867
It really was
eight layers?

05:44.900 --> 05:46.366
Even though
we may ask,

05:46.400 --> 05:48.600
no woman really wants to hear
about an old girlfriend.

05:48.633 --> 05:49.700
It's depressing, okay?

05:49.733 --> 05:51.500
Stanford was five years ago.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.833
You need to move on.
It's time.

05:53.867 --> 05:55.900
Do we really have to have
this conversation again?

05:55.934 --> 05:58.567
We've rehearsed it enough.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.000
Fine. I'll get over
Jill tomorrow.

06:03.034 --> 06:04.266
Hey, there.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.667
(sighs)

06:06.700 --> 06:09.600
Seems like everybody had
a really good time, huh?

06:09.633 --> 06:11.767
I know I did.

06:13.733 --> 06:16.166
Super.

06:16.199 --> 06:18.000
Cheer up, Chuck,
you talked to some women.

06:18.034 --> 06:21.333
You know,
it's a start.

06:21.366 --> 06:23.967
Wow.
Blast-from-the-past wow.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.066
Bryce remembered
your birthday, dude.

06:27.099 --> 06:28.500
The guy who got you
kicked out of school,

06:28.533 --> 06:29.667
the guy who stole your girl,
remember that guy?

06:29.700 --> 06:33.199
Yeah, Morgan, I think
I remember Bryce.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.233
All right, well...

06:35.266 --> 06:37.400
what, uh, what
do we got here?

06:37.433 --> 06:39.266
Huh, what is it?

06:39.300 --> 06:42.034
<i>Zork... You remember Zork
the old text-based video game?</i>

06:42.066 --> 06:44.400
Well, Bryce and I programmed
our own version of it

06:44.433 --> 06:46.500
back at Stanford
using a TRS-80.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.366
Wow, you guys
were really cool.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.867
Yeah, if I could
only remember

06:49.900 --> 06:52.934
what was in my
hero's satchel.

06:52.967 --> 06:56.000
The weapons that I would use
to kill the Terrible Troll.

06:56.034 --> 06:58.500
Right. You know what,
you're still really cool.

06:58.533 --> 07:00.400
And, uh,
you're going home.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.366
Is it that time?
It's that time.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.133
Right.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.266
Pedal safe!
Thank you.

07:08.433 --> 07:10.567
(mutters)

07:11.433 --> 07:12.600
Attack...

07:12.633 --> 07:14.199
troll...

07:14.233 --> 07:16.567
with nasty knife.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.667
(blipping)

07:20.700 --> 07:24.466
(cacophous audio plays
throughout)

07:58.967 --> 08:02.233
(alarm buzzing)

08:02.266 --> 08:03.333
(thuds)

08:08.700 --> 08:10.535
(distorted voice):
Chuck?

08:12.434 --> 08:14.535
Chuck.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.601
Dude...

08:19.635 --> 08:22.734
(normal voice):
Dude, you-you okay?

08:22.767 --> 08:24.034
Morgan?

08:24.067 --> 08:25.468
Yeah, man, yeah, it's me.

08:25.501 --> 08:26.734
What happened?

08:26.767 --> 08:27.767
(grunts and sighs)

08:27.800 --> 08:29.734
I was going to ask you
the same question.

08:31.535 --> 08:32.933
MORGAN:
You okay?

08:34.866 --> 08:37.234
Did you spike the punch?

08:37.268 --> 08:38.534
Something goes wrong,
you blame me.

08:38.568 --> 08:40.001
After all these years,
where's the trust?

08:40.034 --> 08:41.534
Yes, I did.

08:41.568 --> 08:44.201
ANNOUNCER:
The 101 is clear
at Universal City.

08:44.234 --> 08:46.001
Watch out for delays
near Burbank Airport.

08:46.034 --> 08:47.101
Security's checking
all vehicles.

08:51.168 --> 08:52.635
We got a Sigalert on the I-605,

08:52.667 --> 08:54.734
San Gabriel River Freeway,
southbound.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.535
A fender-bender on the I-5,
Santa Ana Freeway,

08:56.568 --> 08:57.800
northbound,
from 91 Freeway to the I-...

08:57.834 --> 08:59.268
<i>MORGAN:
So this morning
I'm playing Xbox.</i>

08:59.301 --> 09:01.201
and I'm like, dude, just let me
get the sniper rifle,

09:01.234 --> 09:03.767
I'll take care of it-- the guy
won't give me the sniper rifle.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.800
I made him eat a frag grenade.
Morgan, Morgan,
Morgan, Morgan.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.001
As much as I would love

09:07.034 --> 09:08.568
to talk video games
with you right now,

09:08.601 --> 09:09.667
I've got a really
splitting headache

09:09.700 --> 09:11.034
and I... In fact,
you know what?

09:11.067 --> 09:13.001
Can you do me a favor?
Do you mind driving?

09:13.034 --> 09:14.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:14.168 --> 09:15.434
Are you-are you, look,
are you being serious?

09:15.468 --> 09:16.501
You're going
to let me drive?

09:16.535 --> 09:18.234
It's a company car, Morgan.

09:18.268 --> 09:19.501
It's not that
big a deal.

09:19.535 --> 09:21.601
It's not just a
company car, okay?

09:21.635 --> 09:23.168
A hoopty's
a hoopty, home boy.

09:23.201 --> 09:26.201
I mean, this baby's
sitting on chrome.

09:26.234 --> 09:28.334
Do me a favor
and stay off the 5, okay?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.468
Because the cops are
in a phased... deployment.

09:34.101 --> 09:35.501
Okay.

09:35.535 --> 09:37.168
Thanks for the tip, Ponch.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.334
(music playing)

09:42.934 --> 09:45.434
Fellow nerds, today is going
to be a very bad day.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.767
We've got a new computer
virus on our hands.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.401
They're calling this one
the Irene Demova virus.

09:49.434 --> 09:50.767
(laughing)

09:50.800 --> 09:54.934
Yes, yes, it's named after
the Serbian porn star.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.468
Lonely dude call volume
will be high.

09:57.501 --> 09:59.535
This is a nasty one, kids.
It's a computer killer.

09:59.568 --> 10:03.635
Last night, the display version
of our Prism Express laptop

10:03.667 --> 10:05.268
<i>was fried when someone...</i>

10:05.301 --> 10:06.468
Excuse me...
decided to enter

10:06.501 --> 10:08.700
Ms. Demova's Web site.

10:08.734 --> 10:09.800
Anna, close the eyes.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.834
This is what happens.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.700
WOMAN:
Food is sexy?

10:13.734 --> 10:14.967
Am I sexy?

10:15.001 --> 10:18.067
(voice distorts):
Am I... sexy...?

10:24.234 --> 10:26.201
But that's love.

10:27.734 --> 10:29.934
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll please just ignore

10:29.967 --> 10:31.401
Dirty Uncle Morgan,

10:31.434 --> 10:33.168
I think that everything...

10:33.201 --> 10:34.867
...to arrive in Los Angeles
later today

10:34.901 --> 10:36.667
to deliver a speech before
the Pacific Security League

10:36.700 --> 10:39.800
tomorrow evening.
...will be...

10:39.834 --> 10:42.134
The general has drawn fire
for his criticism...
...normal.

10:42.168 --> 10:46.034
General Stanfield, the former
Allied Commander of NATO...

10:46.067 --> 10:49.101
He's already here.

10:49.134 --> 10:50.667
He landed last night.

10:50.700 --> 10:56.767
Who's already
here, Chuckles?

10:56.800 --> 10:59.001
I don't know.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.568
We'll have updates
for you as events unfold.

11:02.601 --> 11:06.201
<i>WOMAN:
Bryce Larkin was CIA, Graham.</i>

11:06.234 --> 11:07.700
He was one of your agents.

11:07.734 --> 11:14.501
GRAHAM:
And it was NSA's job
to find him

11:14.535 --> 11:16.301
No, you got a dead CIA agent.

11:16.334 --> 11:18.067
It's a gold star in my book.

11:18.101 --> 11:19.501
If this gets out...
It won't.

11:19.535 --> 11:20.501
Nobody asked you.

11:20.535 --> 11:21.934
Actually, they did.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.767
Major Casey
is heading up

11:23.800 --> 11:24.867
this investigation.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.067
So what was
Bryce after, hmm?

11:27.101 --> 11:28.734
What did this
computer do?

11:28.767 --> 11:31.568
Well, this computer
did everything.

11:31.601 --> 11:33.767
After 9/11,

11:33.800 --> 11:39.535
the NSA and the CIA were told
to play nice--

11:39.568 --> 11:41.501
Every scrap of data we had
went into this computer.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.034
<i>It mined for patterns
in the chatter.</i>

11:44.067 --> 11:45.700
<i>Saw things we didn't.</i>

11:45.734 --> 11:48.101
<i>WOMAN:
The data was encrypted
into thousands of images.</i>

11:48.134 --> 11:54.401
<i>Whoever received Larkin's
e-mail got all of our secrets.</i>

11:54.434 --> 11:56.535
I found this on Larkin.

11:56.568 --> 11:59.501
Hard drive is fried.

11:59.535 --> 12:00.767
We picked up a trace signature.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.101
Where?

12:02.134 --> 12:04.134
Los Angeles.

12:04.168 --> 12:07.201
Which is perfect-- I've been
feeling a little pasty.

12:16.234 --> 12:17.800
Stop the presses!

12:17.834 --> 12:19.800
<i>Who is that?
Vicki Vale.</i>

12:19.834 --> 12:21.901
(singsongy):
Vicki Vale, Vick-Vicki Vale.

12:21.934 --> 12:24.501
Vickity-Vickity, Vicki Vale,
Vic-Vicki Vale.

12:25.734 --> 12:30.067
I hope I'm not interrupting.

12:30.101 --> 12:31.867
<i>That's... it's from Batman.</i>

12:31.901 --> 12:33.368
'Cause that
makes it better.

12:33.401 --> 12:34.501
(chuckles nervously)

12:34.535 --> 12:36.001
Hi. I'm Morgan.

12:36.034 --> 12:37.535
This is, uh, this is Chuck.

12:37.568 --> 12:40.268
Wow! I didn't think people
still named their kids

12:40.301 --> 12:42.368
Chuck, or Morgan,
for that matter.

12:42.401 --> 12:44.101
My parents are sadists,

12:44.134 --> 12:45.767
and carnival freaks
found him in a Dumpster.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.268
But they raised me
as one of their own.

12:49.301 --> 12:50.501
How can I help... you?

12:50.535 --> 12:51.568
Sarah.
Sarah.

12:51.601 --> 12:52.800
I'm here about this.

12:52.834 --> 12:55.700
Oh, yeah. The Intelicel.
Yeah. Absolutely.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.368
This model has a little screw
that pops loose

12:59.401 --> 13:01.301
right in the back here.

13:01.334 --> 13:03.101
Just go ahead and give it
a couple of quick turns

13:03.134 --> 13:05.134
and...

13:05.168 --> 13:07.201
good as new, no problem.

13:07.234 --> 13:09.700
<i>Wow! You geeks are good.</i>

13:09.734 --> 13:12.301
Nerds.
I would say nerds
probably more...

13:12.334 --> 13:13.867
It's no big deal.

13:13.901 --> 13:14.934
...you know, yeah.
I mean, Nerd Herd.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.034
Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.168
I have an emergency.

13:17.201 --> 13:18.734
I don't know what I did wrong,

13:18.767 --> 13:20.134
but I shot the entire recital,

13:20.168 --> 13:21.934
but, um, now it...
now it won't play back.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.700
Okay. Okay.
We'll just take a look and...

13:25.734 --> 13:27.901
You don't have a tape in here.

13:27.934 --> 13:30.767
But it's digital.
Oh, boy.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.901
Right. Yes. But you

13:31.934 --> 13:33.234
still need digital tape.

13:33.268 --> 13:37.301
Oh, no. Her mom's
going to kill me.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.434
Uh... Morgan,
I need the wall.

13:41.468 --> 13:42.568
It's yours.

13:43.667 --> 13:44.700
I'm so sorry.

13:44.734 --> 13:47.667
Okay. This... this way.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.134
You ready?

13:50.168 --> 13:51.468
What's wrong?

13:51.501 --> 13:53.067
I'm usually
in the back row.

13:53.101 --> 13:54.501
Why?

13:54.535 --> 13:55.867
I'm too tall.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.867
I block the
other ballerinas.

13:57.901 --> 13:59.134
Can I tell you
a secret?

13:59.168 --> 14:00.568
But you can't tell
the other girls.

14:00.601 --> 14:04.901
<i>Real ballerinas
are tall.</i>

14:06.501 --> 14:09.501
(classical music plays)

14:29.168 --> 14:30.667
(applause)

14:30.700 --> 14:32.834
Did you get it? Did it work?

14:40.368 --> 14:41.967
Five minutes?

14:42.001 --> 14:47.734
Do you know what five minutes
means inuy More dollars?

14:47.767 --> 14:49.401
Look, I'm sorry
about all the commotion.

14:49.434 --> 14:51.301
We are not stock boys
anymore, Chuck!

14:51.334 --> 14:53.635
We are leaders,
Buy More

14:53.667 --> 14:55.067
leaders.

14:55.101 --> 15:01.934
And you wonder why Big Mike
wants me for assistant manager.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.401
Big Mike didn't tell me
about that.

15:03.434 --> 15:07.401
And why should he?

15:14.101 --> 15:21.501
Chuck, dude,
she left you her card.

15:21.535 --> 15:22.934
(sniffs)

15:22.967 --> 15:26.301
<i>MORGAN:
Why wouldn't
you call this girl?</i>

15:26.334 --> 15:27.934
Oh, I don't know.
Did you see her?

15:27.967 --> 15:29.201
Yes. Oh, man, yes.

15:29.234 --> 15:30.834
That's why I'm going
to repeat the question.

15:30.867 --> 15:32.301
Why wouldn't you
call this girl?

15:32.334 --> 15:34.134
Because I live
on planet Earth, Morgan.

15:34.168 --> 15:35.834
Why are you following me home?

15:35.867 --> 15:38.101
Aw, come... Hey.
We're buddies.

15:38.134 --> 15:39.635
We're going to go
do friend things,

15:39.667 --> 15:41.501
and... and... I need
to use your computer

15:41.535 --> 15:43.568
because mine's still
acting up on me.

15:43.601 --> 15:45.468
(chuckles):
Irene Demova.

15:45.501 --> 15:50.368
Ah! So beautiful
and so... deadly.

15:50.401 --> 15:52.101
BOTH (sighing):
Yeah.

15:52.134 --> 15:53.635
You know, you got
to understand.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.334
This is what I've
been telling people

15:55.368 --> 15:57.301
for I don't know
how long...

15:58.867 --> 16:01.334
Please, not the computer.

16:04.535 --> 16:06.967
(electro-pop music plays)

16:08.234 --> 16:10.034
Aah!

16:10.067 --> 16:11.001
Oh!

16:15.234 --> 16:17.967
(music playing)

16:20.101 --> 16:22.568
Give me the...
(stammering)

16:22.601 --> 16:24.134
Oh!

16:24.168 --> 16:25.601
(grunts)

16:25.635 --> 16:27.234
(coughing)

16:29.101 --> 16:31.201
That's my friend!

16:31.234 --> 16:33.168
(yelling)

16:35.067 --> 16:36.734
Okay, look, he's not
that good of a friend.

16:45.635 --> 16:48.268
Didn't you hang that shelf?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.700
Damn it!

17:03.700 --> 17:05.334
(metal clattering)

17:05.367 --> 17:07.032
Nah, I've been through it.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.534
It's dead. It's totally fried.

17:08.567 --> 17:10.400
This hard drive was...

17:10.434 --> 17:12.633
murdered.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.032
What if you were
the unwitting target

17:14.067 --> 17:15.267
of a ninja vendetta,

17:15.300 --> 17:16.434
and he returns tonight

17:16.467 --> 17:18.334
to strangle you
with his nunchakus?

17:20.099 --> 17:21.900
That's super, Jeff.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.833
Thanks for thinking
outside the box on that one.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.099
And here I thought I couldn't
get any more freaked out.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.067
I'm going to go
buy some new locks

17:31.100 --> 17:33.534
next door at Large Mart.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.867
(Muzak plays over PA)

17:50.467 --> 17:52.833
Oh, thank God.
Uh... Excuse me, sir.

17:52.867 --> 17:54.167
Do you know
where they sell the...?

Wh do you want?

18:02.967 --> 18:07.900
Um... um... No.
Sorry. Sorry. Nothing.

18:07.933 --> 18:12.134
Nothing at all.

Oh! Oh, my God!
Thank God! Thank God! Listen!

19:05.633 --> 19:06.967
There's a guy here,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.900
and 's trying to do
something. I don't know.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.400
You have to call the cops--
Security--

19:10.434 --> 19:11.633
the guy at the front
who's checking receipts.

19:11.666 --> 19:12.833
Uh-huh. What kind of guy?

19:12.867 --> 19:14.200
Scary, kind of
a Terminator vibe.

19:14.234 --> 19:15.167
Stubble. Red hair.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.267
Black leather jacket?

19:17.300 --> 19:18.567
Yes! Yes!

19:20.933 --> 19:22.867
Like that guy.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.033
(Muzak plays over PA)

19:36.434 --> 19:38.367
(exasperated sigh)

19:51.067 --> 19:53.700
Like I said, the computer
was destroyed. Beyond repair.

19:53.733 --> 19:56.267
Okay. It's done.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.167
I want you in the air
in an hour.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.933
But what if he has
an external drive? A backup?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.167
It's over, Sarah.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.400
The NSA is stepping in.

20:04.434 --> 20:07.700
Bryce was CIA, he was our guy,
and he burned us.

20:07.733 --> 20:10.000
Casey's on his way out.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.567
You're being recalled.

20:12.601 --> 20:15.234
'Cause of Casey?

20:15.267 --> 20:21.300
He's a burnout.

20:21.334 --> 20:24.067
Whatever happened with Bryce,
you couldn't have known.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.666
You couldn't have stopped.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.200
But I can fix it.

20:27.234 --> 20:28.900
If there's a backup,
I'll find it.

20:28.933 --> 20:30.267
Just give me 12 hours.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.567
I'm losing my mind.
I'm losing my mind.

20:37.601 --> 20:39.267
(bell dings)

20:39.300 --> 20:41.567
Morgan, not now.

20:44.501 --> 20:46.467
Hi! Hi...

20:46.501 --> 20:48.567
Uh... phone trouble again?

20:48.601 --> 20:52.800
Uh.. yeah. I'm not sure
I'm able to receive calls,

20:52.833 --> 20:55.967
'cause I never got one
fr you.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.666
Oh, man!
She...

21:02.700 --> 21:04.167
I had an appointment
with a realtor.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.300
I just moved here.

21:05.334 --> 21:06.334
Welcome.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.067
Thanks.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.000
And, uh... I don't
really know anyone here.

21:11.033 --> 21:13.666
I was wowondering if
you would show me around.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.833
That is,

21:15.867 --> 21:22.900
if you're free.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.033
You guys are going
to have a great time.

Yeah, I'm on it.

21:28.766 --> 21:31.200
Apparently,
my schedule is wide open.

21:31.234 --> 21:33.134
Great.

(TV playing)
Hey, Chuck.

21:50.967 --> 21:53.100
Ellie, Captain.
Don't freak out.

21:53.134 --> 21:54.501
Remain calm.

21:54.534 --> 21:56.400
I have some news.

21:56.434 --> 21:57.833
Chuck's got a date!

21:57.867 --> 21:59.601
What? Who?

21:59.633 --> 22:00.766
Way to go, Chuck.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.067
That's awesome.

22:03.100 --> 22:06.234
Oh, God, what are
you going to wear?

So, Sarah...</i>

22:14.434 --> 22:17.601
She's nice? Pretty?

22:17.633 --> 22:19.134
Yeah. Actually,
Morgan met her online

22:19.167 --> 22:20.167
in this kind
of chat room...

22:20.200 --> 22:21.134
I'm totally kidding.

22:21.167 --> 22:25.501
Try it on.
Honestly, this...

23:02.700 --> 23:04.666
Hey, so, these
are left over
from the party.

23:04.700 --> 23:05.766
Take those.
Oh, okay.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.033
And, um, don't forget

23:08.067 --> 23:10.067
about the old
girlfriend rule.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.100
Right, got it.
No mention of Jill.

23:13.134 --> 23:17.067
Aces, Charles. You're aces.

23:18.601 --> 23:20.467
A Dad quote. I'm impressed.

23:20.501 --> 23:21.601
Love you, sis.

23:21.633 --> 23:22.766
I love you. Have fun.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.766
I will.

23:23.800 --> 23:29.434
I'll try.

23:29.467 --> 23:30.700
They just...

23:30.733 --> 23:34.400
They grow up so fast,
you know, and...

23:34.434 --> 23:37.567
Just go home.
Go home.

23:37.601 --> 23:39.234
He's picking me up for a date.

23:39.267 --> 23:41.900
You're on your own
on this one, Sarah.

23:41.933 --> 23:43.933
I can't help you
if something goes wrong.

23:43.967 --> 23:45.967
I don't know
about this guy, Graham.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.567
Nice guys aren't sent
government secrets.

23:51.733 --> 23:54.334

23:54.700 --> 23:56.200
Kill him.

So, yeah, I live
with my sister

Captain Awesome.

24:17.434 --> 24:18.467
No! (laughs)

24:18.500 --> 24:19.434
It's true, though.

24:19.467 --> 24:20.667
So, so, wait.

24:20.701 --> 24:22.534
You call him
"Captain Awesome"?

24:22.567 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, wait
till you meet him.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.733
Everything he does is awesome:

24:26.766 --> 24:29.434
climbing mountains,
jumping out of planes, flossing.

24:29.467 --> 24:30.900
That's funny.

24:30.933 --> 24:32.667
I'm-I'm a funny guy.

24:32.701 --> 24:36.133
Clearly. Which is good
'cause I am not funny.

24:36.167 --> 24:37.434
Is that your big secret,
by the way?

24:37.467 --> 24:38.833
'Cause I've been
sitting here

24:38.866 --> 24:40.567

what's wrong with you.

24:40.601 --> 24:42.400
Oh, plenty, believe me.

24:42.434 --> 24:44.100
And I was thinking
either she's a cannibal

24:44.133 --> 24:45.500
or she's really not that funny,

24:45.534 --> 24:46.667
and I was pulling
for cannibal

24:46.701 --> 24:47.900
'cause I never met one before.

24:47.933 --> 24:49.933
Uh, not a cannibal,

24:49.967 --> 24:52.334
but I did just come out
of a long relationship,

24:52.367 --> 24:54.334
so I may come with baggage.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.601
I could be your very own
baggage handler.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.467
Uh, so the guy, the ex, the guy,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.033
the ex is the reason
you moved here from...

25:06.067 --> 25:07.500
Uh, D.C.
Right.

25:07.534 --> 25:08.766
Yeah, after I realized

25:08.800 --> 25:10.500
that all of my friends
were his friends

25:10.534 --> 25:12.434
and that everything
about Washington

25:12.467 --> 25:14.167
reminded me of... Bruce,

25:14.200 --> 25:18.234
I needed a change, a big one.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.367
Bruce... yeah.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.701
You give me crap
for being Chuck

25:21.733 --> 25:23.234
and you went out with a Bruce?

25:23.267 --> 25:25.534
That's nice.
That's real good.

25:25.567 --> 25:26.967
So, so what about you?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.933
What skeletons do you have
in your closet?

25:30.601 --> 25:33.434
Any secrets? Any women?

25:33.467 --> 25:41.766
Uh, yeah, yeah.

25:43.267 --> 25:48.167
Actually,
that's all over with now

25:48.200 --> 25:49.400
(both laugh)

25:49.434 --> 25:52.100
So...
I like you, Chuck.

25:57.866 --> 25:59.833
So, where
are we going?

25:59.866 --> 26:01.534
Well, do you like music?

26:01.567 --> 26:02.900
I guess.

26:02.933 --> 26:05.067
(laughing):
You guess?

26:05.100 --> 26:06.100
What's your favorite band?

26:08.133 --> 26:10.667
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

26:10.701 --> 26:13.100
God, I'm not funny,
I don't listen to music.

26:13.133 --> 26:15.000
This must be your
worst date ever, right?

26:15.033 --> 26:17.200
(sirens wailing)

26:24.967 --> 26:26.567
I was waiting
for you to say "no."

26:31.267 --> 26:34.367
Sorry, sorry, I kind of
zoned out there for a second.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.833
No. No, no, no.

26:35.866 --> 26:38.967
God, no, I, uh, I've had...
I've had much, much worse,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.900
uh, much worse dates;

26:40.933 --> 26:42.634
experiences overall
with women.

26:42.667 --> 26:43.967
In 11th grade, actually.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.167
11th grade?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.334
(laughs):
Oh, you have to go
back that far?

26:47.367 --> 26:48.234
Come on.

26:48.267 --> 26:49.933
I really don't
date all that much.

26:56.234 --> 26:58.601
Chuck Bartowski's your mark.

26:58.634 --> 27:00.634
NSA director wants him
with a pulse.

27:00.667 --> 27:04.766
Till we find out
who he's working with

27:04.800 --> 27:10.334
CIA skirt...
you can kill.

27:10.367 --> 27:13.967
(both laugh)

27:14.000 --> 27:17.033
(audience clamoring)

27:24.133 --> 27:27.167
(indistinct singing)

27:27.200 --> 27:29.033
They're good.
Good!

27:29.733 --> 27:43.200
Good!

27:43.234 --> 27:45.534
Let's dance!
I'm not really a dancer.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.800
(gasps)

28:20.766 --> 28:22.800
(men groan)

28:31.800 --> 28:34.100
(grunting)

28:42.900 --> 28:43.967
Hey-hey-hey,
where's the fire?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.067
Chuck, give me your keys.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.534
I don't mean
to be old-fashioned,

28:46.567 --> 28:48.167
but the company only
wants employees--

28:48.200 --> 28:51.567
nerds-- driving
the Nerd Herd-mobile.

28:51.601 --> 28:53.434
(mechanical whirring)

28:53.467 --> 28:54.567
Get in the car.

28:54.601 --> 28:59.400
How did you get into my car?

28:59.434 --> 29:00.500
Sarah...
Just get in!

29:00.534 --> 29:01.766
What is going on?

29:07.534 --> 29:09.200
Please tell me what's going on!

29:10.500 --> 29:12.667
Sarah, you're not even looking!

29:13.400 --> 29:14.500
Wait, wait, wait.

29:14.534 --> 29:19.367
Who are these guys?
What do they want?

29:23.701 --> 29:25.634
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I'm gonna die!

29:29.033 --> 29:30.733
Tell me when to turn.

29:30.766 --> 29:34.367
Uh, uh, left in five seconds!

29:34.400 --> 29:37.100
(yelps)
Your left or my left?

29:37.133 --> 29:38.067
What?

29:38.100 --> 29:41.701
Too late!
(screams)

29:41.733 --> 29:43.467
(screams):
Oh, my God!

29:49.800 --> 29:51.467
Computer emergency.

29:57.267 --> 29:59.267
Listen to me, Chuck.
Those men will hurt you.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.933
They're from the NSA
and they're after you.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.500
Me? Why, why?

30:02.534 --> 30:04.234
Why me? I'm nobody.

30:04.267 --> 30:06.434
I'm the supervisor of
a Nerd Herd at a Buy More.

30:06.467 --> 30:08.133
Maybe one day I'll be
assistant store manager

30:08.167 --> 30:10.267
and I don't even know
if I want that job.

30:10.300 --> 30:13.267
You know,
that's not your problem...

30:18.866 --> 30:20.100
(gasps)

30:22.434 --> 30:23.500
Back! Back!

30:24.766 --> 30:27.300
(gasps)
Get out of the car.

30:27.334 --> 30:28.534
Let's go, Chuck. Move!

30:28.567 --> 30:31.200
Wait, wait...

30:34.634 --> 30:36.334
Sarah, look out!

30:53.133 --> 30:55.067
Request emergency air-evac.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.367
Track location, we're on foot.

30:57.434 --> 30:58.567
Let's go!

31:01.833 --> 31:03.866
How well do you know
Bryce Larkin?

31:03.900 --> 31:05.733
What? How do you...
how do you know Bryce?

31:05.766 --> 31:07.167
We worked together
at the CIA.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.467
The what?!
The CIA?!

31:09.500 --> 31:10.800
Bryce is a spy?!

31:10.833 --> 31:12.300
Bryce Larkin from
Connecticut is a spy?!

31:12.334 --> 31:13.667
A rogue spy.

31:13.701 --> 31:15.234
Did he try to contact you?

31:15.267 --> 31:18.033
I haven't heard from Bryce in...

31:19.534 --> 31:20.933
Wait. No, he...

31:20.967 --> 31:22.701
He-he sent,
he sent me an e-mail.

31:22.733 --> 31:25.434
Did you open it?

31:25.467 --> 31:28.367
<i>Yeah. It was, it was
a line from Zork.</i>

31:28.400 --> 31:29.667
What?

31:29.701 --> 31:31.033
<i>Zork, it's a video game
that we used to play.</i>

31:31.067 --> 31:33.967
It was like a riddle,
and I solved it

31:34.000 --> 31:35.067
Lots and lots of pictures.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.601
You saw them?

31:39.200 --> 31:41.500
Uh, your computer,
did you back it up?

31:41.534 --> 31:42.833
Is there an external drive?

31:42.866 --> 31:44.033
It crashed a week ago.

31:44.067 --> 31:45.833
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

31:45.866 --> 31:47.900
Was I not supposed
to look at those pictures?

31:47.933 --> 31:50.334
Okay, I may have to aim
my gun at you,

31:50.367 --> 31:52.467
so just don't
freak out.
Why?

31:55.667 --> 31:57.234
It's late. I'm tired.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.100
Let's cut the crap
and give him to me now.

32:01.133 --> 32:04.000
He belongs
to the NSA.

32:04.033 --> 32:05.400
(gasps)
The CIA gets him first.

32:08.334 --> 32:09.701
You come any closer and I shoot.

32:11.601 --> 32:12.933
Sarah...

32:13.100 --> 32:14.500
I'm freaked out!

32:20.700 --> 32:23.533
You shoot him,
I shoot you.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.300
I leave both your bodies here,

32:25.333 --> 32:26.867
go out
for a late snack.

32:26.934 --> 32:28.333
I'm thinking may be pancakes.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.467
Chuck, no!

32:33.133 --> 32:35.400
<i>NEWS ANCHOR:
General Stanfield,
the former ally...</i>

32:35.433 --> 32:37.166
<i>...stop tomorrow night's
speech from happening.</i>

32:44.400 --> 32:46.467
They're gonna kill him.

32:47.467 --> 32:50.933
Kill who?

32:50.966 --> 32:52.300
The General Stanfield,
the NATO guy.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.433
Look, something is wrong
with me, okay?

32:57.467 --> 32:58.732
I don't know
what it is,

32:58.766 --> 33:00.333
but something is very,
very wrong with me,

33:00.366 --> 33:02.133
and I'm remembering things
that I shouldn't know.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.933
Okay, Chuck, talk to me.
Like what?

33:03.966 --> 33:05.732
I don't know. I don't know.
For example, uh...

33:05.766 --> 33:07.300
there was, there was a Serbian
demolitions expert

33:07.333 --> 33:08.333
at the Large Mart today.

33:08.366 --> 33:10.100
That's kinof odd,
wouldn't you say?

33:10.133 --> 33:13.666
Look, last week
the NSA,

33:13.699 --> 33:15.999
blueprints of a hotel,
that hotel.

33:16.033 --> 33:19.766
And then the CIA,
you guys found a file

33:19.799 --> 33:25.333
The bomb is in that hotel!

33:25.366 --> 33:27.732
No, he opened Bryce's e-mail.

33:29.433 --> 33:31.866
Chuck, those pictures that you
saw were encoded with secrets,

33:31.899 --> 33:33.400
government secrets.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.366
If you saw them,
then you know them.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.966
There were thousands of 'em.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.666
Wait a minute.

33:38.699 --> 33:40.933
You're telling me
all of our secrets

33:40.966 --> 33:43.133
are in his head.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.732
<i>Chuck, is
the computer.</i>

33:45.766 --> 33:48.066
What did you, what did you say?
What does that mean?

33:48.100 --> 33:49.799
Chuck, you have to listen to me.
You have ttell us where...

33:49.833 --> 33:50.966
What's happening to me?!

33:50.999 --> 33:52.933
You said there was a bomb.
Is there time to stop it?

33:52.966 --> 33:54.766
What? What? Are you crazy?!

33:54.799 --> 33:58.467
No, we're the good guys.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.899
Look, I can't,
I can't help you, okay?

34:00.933 --> 34:02.699
I really wish that I could,
but I can't.

34:02.732 --> 34:04.666
Call Bryce. He's the guy
that can save the day.

34:04.699 --> 34:05.933
Bryce is dead!

34:07.666 --> 34:12.100
He died sending
those secrets to you.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.400
(gunshot)

34:16.433 --> 34:18.699
Yeah, and he's gonna
have a lot of company

34:18.732 --> 34:19.766
unless you start talking.

34:19.799 --> 34:21.166
So, pretty please...

34:21.199 --> 34:23.467
can we defuse
the bomb now?

34:25.933 --> 34:28.033
general's already on the stage.

34:28.065 --> 34:31.833
...was our mission to give
our nation's diplomats

34:31.866 --> 34:36.467
the military perspective
on world issues.

34:36.500 --> 34:40.065
Now, maybe it was just
because I was a uniform...

34:40.100 --> 34:43.132
Wait! Casey, wait!
We can't take him in.

34:43.166 --> 34:45.533
He's too valuable.
Okay,
Johnny Commodore.

34:45.567 --> 34:48.065
You stay here, but you
tell us where to go.

34:48.100 --> 34:49.866
Uh, the easiest way?
No, fastest, Chuck.

34:49.899 --> 34:52.033
The fastest. Got it.

34:52.065 --> 34:55.833
Chuck, stop!

34:55.866 --> 34:57.833
Chuck, wait!

34:57.866 --> 35:00.999
You know, it takes courage
to speak out, to take action...

35:01.033 --> 35:02.699
This way! This way!

35:02.732 --> 35:03.933
(yelling gibberish)

35:03.966 --> 35:05.300
This way! This way! This way!

35:12.799 --> 35:16.467
...general officer
to make a political...

35:16.500 --> 35:19.467
...what that means is,
we simply shouldn't do it.

35:19.500 --> 35:23.300
Well, I disagree.

35:23.333 --> 35:27.799
That's it.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.100
It's in this...
uh, right here.

35:30.966 --> 35:31.999
Oh, God.

35:32.033 --> 35:33.266
No time to evacuate.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.133
Ideas?
Disconnect the lap top.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.799
There's no trigger.
The cables.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.200
No, definitely
a trap.

35:38.233 --> 35:40.632
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

35:40.666 --> 35:42.599
Uh... ladies and gentlemen,

35:42.632 --> 35:45.200
we-we may have a cautionary
situation here,

35:45.233 --> 35:47.033
so we'll take a short break.

35:47.066 --> 35:48.166
Chuck, is there
anything else

35:48.200 --> 35:49.266
you remember
about the bomb?

35:49.300 --> 35:50.966
MAN:
What's the situation?

35:50.999 --> 35:53.066
(cell phone playing rock song)

35:56.467 --> 35:57.766
Hi, Morgan.

35:57.799 --> 36:00.266
Hey, how's it going?
Little busy right now, buddy.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.200
In a good way? Details.

36:03.233 --> 36:04.233
Why are you calling?

36:04.266 --> 36:05.599
I don't know, just...

36:05.632 --> 36:07.799
laying on your bed,
Ellie's with the captain.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.467
My computer's got
a case of the Demovas.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.200
So, I figured I'd check in.

36:11.233 --> 36:12.400
You old...

36:12.433 --> 36:14.366
Okay, okay, I have an idea.

36:15.266 --> 36:16.699
That's not an XBox.

36:16.732 --> 36:17.899
<i>And you're not
in X Men.</i>

36:17.933 --> 36:19.100
I understand that.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.366
This is a Prism Express
laptop, okay.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.533
We sell this at our store.

36:21.567 --> 36:26.866
It has a DOS override.

36:26.899 --> 36:28.433
I think I can do this.

36:28.467 --> 36:30.200
I can dohis, please.

36:30.233 --> 36:31.866
He's our best shot.

36:35.533 --> 36:36.866
Go.

36:39.732 --> 36:45.866
Mr. Bomb, meet Mr. Internet.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.899
He's searching for porn.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.200
Oh, this sexy.

36:52.233 --> 36:55.966
Oh.
Hey, sexy.

36:55.999 --> 36:58.100
(whimpering)

37:04.732 --> 37:06.100
You did it.

37:08.732 --> 37:10.133
I did it.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.567
I did it. I...

37:12.599 --> 37:14.666
I defused a real bomb.

37:14.699 --> 37:17.266
(laughs):
This was a real...

37:19.866 --> 37:22.433
What if I was wrong?

37:24.799 --> 37:26.766
Don't puke on the ***

37:32.700 --> 37:34.067
BOTH:
He's coming with me.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.366
What if this was a fluke?

37:36.399 --> 37:37.700
What if he can stop
mething bigger?

37:37.733 --> 37:39.299
Fine, we drop him
in a psych tank,

37:39.333 --> 37:41.266
let him stare at four
rubber walls for a decade.

37:41.299 --> 37:42.867
He'll tell us what
we want to know.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.200
Casey, we don't know
how this works

37:44.234 --> 37:45.466
and what triggers the memories.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.566
He'll crack wide open.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.666
Not my job.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.266
I break things,
I don't fix them.

37:49.299 --> 37:50.299
What about his job?

37:50.333 --> 37:51.433
And his friends?

37:51.466 --> 37:52.767
What do we do about his sister?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.900
What about my sister?

37:54.933 --> 37:56.333
Nothing.

37:56.366 --> 37:57.366
We were just
discussing...

37:57.399 --> 37:59.067
No, no, no,
hold on a second.

37:59.100 --> 38:01.600
You have to leave my family
and my friends out of this.

38:01.633 --> 38:02.933
We'll see.

38:04.767 --> 38:06.566
Look, Bryce sent
that e-mail to me.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.466
I'm the one remembering
your secrets.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.867
Which means you have to
listen to me, both of you.

38:10.900 --> 38:13.533
And right now...

38:13.566 --> 38:15.433
I'm going to go home.

38:15.466 --> 38:20.633
No, you're not.
Uh-uh.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.333
You...

38:23.366 --> 38:25.933
you need me.

38:36.234 --> 38:39.466
(music playing)

38:59.733 --> 39:02.100
How long you been here?

39:02.134 --> 39:05.000
All night.

39:05.033 --> 39:07.299
There's nowhere
I can run, is there?

39:07.333 --> 39:09.566
Not from us.

39:14.433 --> 39:17.500
Talk to me, Chuck.

39:17.533 --> 39:19.500
Yesterday I was making
11 bucks an hour

39:19.533 --> 39:20.666
fixing computers.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.933
Now I have one in my brain.

39:22.967 --> 39:25.266
And I can't figure out
why Bryce did this,

39:25.299 --> 39:29.067
why he chose me.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.800
What are you going
to do with me?

39:30.833 --> 39:33.867
What happens now?

39:33.900 --> 39:37.167
For now, you go back
to your own life.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.700
We'll protect you and
you'll work with us.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.299
And my sister, my friends,
are they in danger?

39:46.333 --> 39:50.700
All night!
Do you know how
worried I was?

39:50.733 --> 39:52.234
How far did you get?
Morgan,
shut up.

39:54.399 --> 39:56.767
You tell them nothing
to keep them safe.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.366
Early morning
procedure, so...

40:02.399 --> 40:04.000
Group hug, huh?

40:05.833 --> 40:06.800
Okay.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.033
Awesome.

40:09.067 --> 40:13.000
Need you to do one
more thing for me.

40:14.333 --> 40:15.466
Yeah?

40:15.500 --> 40:17.833
Trust me, Chuck.

40:20.967 --> 40:36.399
(music playing)

40:54.033 --> 40:57.134
Well, wish me luck.

40:57.167 --> 41:01.666
(dramatic music plays)

41:23.833 --> 41:26.733
(dramatic music continues)

41:33.733 --> 41:35.500
(music volume decreases)

41:35.533 --> 41:38.299
Sorry, man.

41:38.333 --> 41:39.433
Go get 'em.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.433
Didn't think you'd apply.

41:51.466 --> 41:53.666
Well, uh...

41:53.700 --> 41:55.500
I think I'm ready
for this, Big Mike,

41:55.533 --> 41:57.967
and what it means--
responsibility, decisive

41:58.000 --> 41:59.100
leadership...
Save it for
the interview.

41:59.134 --> 42:01.299
Now go train
the new guy.
Okeydokey.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.867
(groaning)

42:28.533 --> 42:31.000
(groaning)

42:37.167 --> 42:38.200
Don't freak out.
