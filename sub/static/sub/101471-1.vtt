<i>"Resfeber.</i>

00:40.806 --> 00:41.940
Swedish.

00:42.974 --> 00:45.844
The restless race
of the traveler's heart

00:45.878 --> 00:47.979
before the journey begins,

00:48.013 --> 00:51.117
when anxiety and anticipation
are entangled.

00:52.885 --> 00:54.920
As I packed my bags,

00:54.952 --> 00:58.056
my <i>resfeber</i> surged
at full-throttle,

00:58.089 --> 01:03.528
elevating the smallest decisions
into epoch-making significance.

01:03.562 --> 01:07.599
The choice between sneakers
or flats was lent gravity

01:07.632 --> 01:10.769
usually reserved for
matters of national security."

02:43.295 --> 02:46.030
<i>Just catch some good sleep.</i>

02:46.064 --> 02:48.634
I won't sleep tonight,
I'm too nervous.

02:48.666 --> 02:51.069
- <i>That's just</i> resfeber <i>.</i>
- It's what?

02:51.102 --> 02:53.806
Resfeber, <i>a Swedish word.</i>

02:53.838 --> 02:56.608
<i>It's when you're about
to travel, and you're anxious,</i>

02:56.642 --> 02:59.144
<i>but excited
about the journey ahead.</i>

02:59.177 --> 03:02.181
- Oh, nice to know I'm not alone.
- Enjoy your stay.

03:02.213 --> 03:03.815
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:09.755 --> 03:10.656
Sorry.

03:12.324 --> 03:14.959
<i>Buonasera,</i> madam,
welcome to the Ramada Venice.

03:14.993 --> 03:17.696
Hello, I have a reservation
for three nights,

03:17.729 --> 03:19.898
under the name of Jovana Fey,
with a J.

03:19.932 --> 03:20.732
Thank you.

03:29.641 --> 03:31.643
Madam I'm afraid
your booking was canceled.

03:32.743 --> 03:35.747
That's not possible.
Is your manager here?

03:35.780 --> 03:36.648
That's me.

03:38.951 --> 03:40.086
Perhaps you need to make a call?

03:56.902 --> 03:58.571
This is Alec.

03:58.604 --> 04:01.574
Alec, it's Jovana, um,

04:01.606 --> 04:02.840
I just went to check in

04:02.874 --> 04:04.176
at the Ramada Venice,

04:04.208 --> 04:06.211
and the reservation
was canceled.

04:06.243 --> 04:07.279
Do you know what's happening?

04:08.380 --> 04:10.649
- Amber!
- What?

04:10.682 --> 04:12.952
Tell me you rang Jovana Fey.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.852
I told you I called her
and I left a message.

04:14.886 --> 04:16.689
She says she called
and left you a message.

04:16.721 --> 04:19.992
Um, that's impossible,
I don't use message bank.

04:20.024 --> 04:21.726
She says she doesn't
use message bank.

04:23.728 --> 04:25.663
Jovana is the Bengali
refugee, right?

04:25.696 --> 04:27.966
No, Amber, that's Yolotzyn.

04:34.706 --> 04:35.907
I should have called you myself.

04:38.175 --> 04:41.179
And I've been so busy packing
that I forgot to chase you up.

04:41.213 --> 04:42.081
Packing?

04:43.715 --> 04:45.284
Alec, you're scaring me,
what was the message?

04:47.785 --> 04:49.153
Jovana,

04:49.187 --> 04:51.290
I've gone bankrupt.

04:51.323 --> 04:54.226
- What?
- When we agreed to publish your book

04:54.259 --> 04:56.328
we were already on thin ice,

04:56.360 --> 04:58.796
but were hoping the tides
would turn,

04:58.829 --> 05:01.333
but it never happened,
we're finished, I'm sorry.

05:03.268 --> 05:05.838
Alec,
my novel was released yesterday.

05:05.871 --> 05:07.740
I've just arrived in Venice.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.208
I have a three week tour ahead

05:09.240 --> 05:11.275
to publicize this damn
thing across Europe,

05:11.309 --> 05:12.878
and you're telling me this now?

05:16.715 --> 05:18.717
What are you doing?
Are you typing?

05:18.749 --> 05:20.985
- Speak to me!
- I'm sending you an email.

05:21.018 --> 05:23.254
All rights to
<i>Don't Read This On A Plane</i>

05:23.287 --> 05:27.359
have reverted to you,
effective immediately.

05:27.391 --> 05:29.862
The book stores
at which you'll be speaking

05:29.895 --> 05:32.398
have already bought
and received their copies.

05:32.430 --> 05:35.099
It's your decision
whether to reprint,

05:35.133 --> 05:39.171
whether through a vanity press,
or different publisher, or online.

05:39.203 --> 05:41.939
All your hotel bookings
have been canceled,

05:41.973 --> 05:43.708
because they were payable
upon check-in.

05:43.742 --> 05:45.977
But we did pre-purchase
your flights,

05:46.011 --> 05:49.148
so you can still do
the tour if you like.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.948
You'll just need to pay
for your own taxis,

05:50.982 --> 05:53.218
food, accommodation, promotion,

05:53.251 --> 05:56.822
insurance, communications,
and miscellaneous expenses.

05:56.855 --> 06:00.725
Oh, the Greeks did insist on
upfront payment for your driver.

06:00.759 --> 06:03.395
Uh, nothing
like a collapsed economy

06:03.427 --> 06:06.230
to spark a bit
of entrepreneurial spirit.

06:06.263 --> 06:08.466
Alec, I don't have
a cent to my name,

06:08.499 --> 06:10.802
what use is a bunch of flights?

06:11.770 --> 06:14.106
What about your husband?
Doesn't he work on an oil rig?

06:14.138 --> 06:16.141
Those guys bring home the bacon!

06:16.174 --> 06:18.077
He took a pay cut
to keep his job.

06:18.110 --> 06:20.446
He can barely afford
his share of rent.

06:20.478 --> 06:21.946
Jovana,

06:21.980 --> 06:23.749
I apologize profusely.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.286
Maybe this is for the best. Hm?

06:28.252 --> 06:30.054
I am stranded

06:30.088 --> 06:32.124
and penniless, Alec.

06:32.157 --> 06:35.194
So, how could this
possibly be for the best?

07:07.391 --> 07:09.160
- Name?
- Jovana Fey...

07:10.061 --> 07:10.863
With a J.

08:07.419 --> 08:08.921
- It is possible.
- No, it's not.

08:08.953 --> 08:12.023
- No, it is.
- No, no, no, it's impossible.

08:12.057 --> 08:14.158
If we don't know
what dark matter is,

08:14.191 --> 08:16.093
how can we picture it?

08:16.126 --> 08:17.396
Okay, think about it like this.

08:17.429 --> 08:20.566
Think of a man
blind from birth, right?

08:20.598 --> 08:23.100
He knows that he's blind,
but he has no concept

08:23.134 --> 08:24.869
of what sight actually is.

08:24.903 --> 08:27.239
Is it like hearing, taste,

08:27.271 --> 08:30.374
touch, balance, or temperature?

08:30.408 --> 08:32.477
Right? Then one day,
he undergoes

08:32.510 --> 08:34.547
a revolutionary form
of optical surgery.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.280
They take off the bandages,

08:37.313 --> 08:39.517
and just like that,
he can see the world.

08:39.549 --> 08:43.888
And sight; the perception
of shapes, colors, patterns,

08:43.921 --> 08:46.591
and textures, is like nothing
he could have ever imagined.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.160
That is how
dark matter will be to us.

08:48.193 --> 08:50.028
We know that it's everywhere,

08:50.060 --> 08:51.495
we can detect
its gravitational effects,

08:51.529 --> 08:53.999
yet, we can't observe it, and...

08:54.031 --> 08:57.069
one day, in the near future,
we'll unlock its mystery.

08:57.102 --> 09:00.271
And then we'll be like the blind
man who can finally see.

09:00.304 --> 09:02.306
Or it's a parallel reality,

09:02.339 --> 09:04.275
a civilization
more evolved than us.

09:04.309 --> 09:05.577
And they're
watching us masturbate.

09:07.511 --> 09:10.248
Excuse me,
have you finished with the jam?

09:10.281 --> 09:12.050
- All yours.
- Thanks.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.920
Are you enjoying
Comfy Bed Hostel?

09:14.953 --> 09:17.122
Uh, my back has had better days,

09:17.155 --> 09:19.190
but I hope they've spiked the jam with aspirin.

09:19.223 --> 09:20.925
Yeah, last time I was moafing

09:20.958 --> 09:22.994
I slept on a yoga mat
on the floor,

09:23.027 --> 09:24.428
that was more comfy than here.

09:24.462 --> 09:25.597
Moafing?

09:25.630 --> 09:28.000
Moaf, M-O-A-F,

09:28.032 --> 09:29.267
it means "Mattress On A Floor,"

09:30.299 --> 09:30.434
it's a network of travelers

09:30.468 --> 09:31.670
who'll let you crash for free.

09:31.703 --> 09:33.137
Sometimes you get a couch,

09:33.170 --> 09:34.506
sometimes a hammock.

09:34.539 --> 09:36.341
Sometimes even a bed!

10:26.024 --> 10:28.593
- <i>Ciao,</i> Jovana.
- Oh, <i>ciao,</i> Adamo!

10:30.194 --> 10:32.064
- Lovely to meet you, finally.
- Oh, likewise.

10:32.097 --> 10:34.031
How was the hotel?

10:34.064 --> 10:35.300
Hmm.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.501
You stayed at the Ramada
if I recall?

10:37.535 --> 10:38.437
Yes!

10:40.070 --> 10:41.706
Living the dream.
Come on, let's go.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.508
Oh, leave it there.

10:47.712 --> 10:49.715
"Breeding with the faraway tribe

10:49.747 --> 10:53.218
brings healthier offspring,
she knows subconsciously.

10:53.251 --> 10:55.286
My low-cut top seals the deal.

10:57.088 --> 11:00.358
We barely shout a word
before our mouths lock,

11:00.391 --> 11:02.460
grinding thigh to crotch.

11:02.493 --> 11:06.098
I take her hand, lead her
through a gyrating throng.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.232
Past security.

11:07.265 --> 11:09.234
Past double-stacked beer barrels

11:09.266 --> 11:11.203
and broken blue milk crates."

11:11.236 --> 11:13.739
You need to
turn left at <i>Calle Lunga!</i>

11:13.771 --> 11:16.775
You've crossed the wrong bridge!
You need to turn left...

11:16.808 --> 11:19.410
- Shh!
- Sorry!

11:19.444 --> 11:21.679
Hey, I've got to go.
Figure it out.

11:27.751 --> 11:30.622
"Grass wet with midnight dew,

11:30.655 --> 11:34.059
her breath mist shines
yellow in the highway lamps.

11:34.092 --> 11:36.595
The playground's
primary colored pirate ship

11:36.627 --> 11:39.163
glows in a starry vodka haze.

11:39.197 --> 11:41.266
'My finger is wet.'

11:41.299 --> 11:43.168
She half protests.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.202
As I take a breather
from licking

11:45.236 --> 11:49.508
an 18 year old girl's ass and
pussy in a dimly-lit quadrangle,

11:49.540 --> 11:52.276
I glance down, and notice

11:52.309 --> 11:55.414
the freshly-chalked squares
of a hopscotch court."

11:58.183 --> 11:59.718
<i>Grazie.</i>

12:54.171 --> 12:57.341
And with a straight face,
the guide said,

12:57.375 --> 12:59.344
"For your information Madam,"

12:59.376 --> 13:03.515
"...I hear that
ten times a day."

13:03.548 --> 13:06.384
Wow, people need some fresh impressionism jokes.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.470
There's plenty
of food in the fridge.

13:28.673 --> 13:31.443
- <i>Buona notte.</i>
- Make yourselves at home.

13:32.809 --> 13:34.345
<i>Buona notte.</i>

13:34.378 --> 13:35.579
<i>Buona notte.</i>

13:35.612 --> 13:37.214
Thank you so much for having me!

13:37.247 --> 13:38.217
Don't mention it.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.718
- <i>Oui, allo?</i>
- <i>Hi, Jovana.</i>

14:13.751 --> 14:16.453
<i>It's Ksenia
from the Beehive Bookstore,</i>

14:16.487 --> 14:18.622
<i>calling from Oradea, Romania.</i>

14:18.655 --> 14:20.324
<i>Do you have a moment to talk?</i>

14:20.357 --> 14:23.227
Uh, yeah, sure, hi.

14:23.261 --> 14:25.930
<i>Oh, I just realized
I didn't check the time there.</i>

14:25.963 --> 14:29.568
- <i>Is it late?</i>
- Um, it's midnight here in Venice.

14:29.601 --> 14:32.537
<i>Venice Beach, California, right?</i>

14:32.569 --> 14:35.574
- Italy.
- <i>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!</i>

14:35.607 --> 14:37.576
<i>For some reason
I thought you were in L.A.</i>

14:37.608 --> 14:38.742
<i>I'll call you another time.</i>

14:38.775 --> 14:40.878
No, it's okay,
I was still awake.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.747
<i>Okay, I'll keep it brief.</i>

14:42.780 --> 14:45.717
<i>I wanted to confirm your
reading at the Beehive Bookstore</i>

14:45.750 --> 14:48.852
<i>here in Oradea
on the 28th of this month.</i>

14:48.886 --> 14:51.456
<i>I'd like
to publicize it in advance.</i>

14:51.488 --> 14:53.458
Yep, that's locked in.

14:53.491 --> 14:56.461
<i>Great, I'll leave you
to sleep then.</i>

14:56.493 --> 14:58.997
Um, while I have you,

14:59.030 --> 15:02.333
what type of publicity
were you thinking?

15:02.367 --> 15:06.637
<i>Some online magazines,
but mostly radio if that's okay?</i>

15:06.670 --> 15:09.406
- Sounds good.
- <i>Excellent.</i>

15:09.439 --> 15:12.611
<i>You have a beautiful voice,
so that'd be perfect.</i>

15:12.644 --> 15:13.778
Oh, you think so?

15:13.810 --> 15:16.915
<i>Definitely, it's mellifluous.</i>

15:19.284 --> 15:24.289
You know, "mellifluous" is my
all-time favorite English word.

15:24.322 --> 15:26.691
- But it's not well-known.
- <i>I know!</i>

15:26.723 --> 15:28.993
<i>I used to love "serendipity,"</i>

15:29.026 --> 15:31.295
<i>then strippers started
tattooing it on their ankles.</i>

15:33.598 --> 15:38.402
That's true! Another
nice word is "petrichor."

15:38.435 --> 15:40.738
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

15:40.771 --> 15:43.907
<i>The earthy scent
of rain falling on dry soil.</i>

15:43.940 --> 15:46.511
Oh, my God, you're the first
person I've met to know that.

15:46.544 --> 15:48.547
Not that we've met, but,
you know what I mean?

15:49.713 --> 15:51.583
<i>Am I really the first?</i>

15:51.616 --> 15:52.516
Yes.

15:54.519 --> 15:57.322
<i>I'm sorry Jovana,
I'm keeping you up.</i>

15:57.354 --> 15:59.324
<i>Thank you for
confirming the reading.</i>

15:59.357 --> 16:02.459
<i>If you have any other questions,
just call.</i>

16:02.492 --> 16:03.727
Perfect.

16:03.761 --> 16:05.463
<i>Thanks, Ksenia, good night.</i>

16:06.363 --> 16:07.266
<i>Ciao!</i>

16:24.748 --> 16:27.384
Django Reinhardt
invented hip hop 50 years

16:27.418 --> 16:28.920
before it officially
happened in the Bronx,

16:30.487 --> 16:32.424
but there are no recordings.

16:32.457 --> 16:36.093
These French jazz guys would
improvise on the guitar, violin,

16:36.126 --> 16:39.530
the clarinet and then the
drummer would break into a solo.

16:40.698 --> 16:42.766
And then,
as legend would have it,

16:42.800 --> 16:45.904
they'd take turns
improvising rhymes.

16:45.936 --> 16:47.405
We'd now call that rapping,
right?

16:48.372 --> 16:50.541
- Sure.
- Hm-mm.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.078
But the reason why
they never thought to record it,

16:53.111 --> 16:56.381
- can you guess?
- I don't know.

16:56.414 --> 16:58.650
To them they were
only joking around.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.120
Think of that for a second.

17:02.152 --> 17:04.755
A multi-billion dollar industry,

17:04.789 --> 17:07.790
spanning decades,
with worldwide reach,

17:07.825 --> 17:10.662
could have started
fifty years earlier,

17:10.694 --> 17:12.563
on the other side of the world,

17:12.597 --> 17:14.800
if only one
guy pressed the button.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.002
But they didn't know
it was music.

17:21.570 --> 17:23.675
"They didn't know it was music."

17:29.579 --> 17:30.848
Sorry, I'm not being rude,

17:30.882 --> 17:32.851
I'm just going
to take a note of that.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.886
Are you a writer or something?

17:35.919 --> 17:37.054
Trying to be.

17:39.089 --> 17:42.426
- Ever published?
- Three novels.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.028
Wow!

17:44.060 --> 17:45.597
And you're hitching
through the rough,

17:45.629 --> 17:46.931
tough streets of Italy?

17:51.501 --> 17:52.436
Yep.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.079
Honey,
let me tell you something.

18:03.748 --> 18:06.017
It was my dream
as a kid to drive a truck.

18:07.617 --> 18:10.422
All the boys
wanted to be footballers,

18:10.454 --> 18:13.558
the girls wanted
to be ballerinas.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.994
But when I saw
these big shiny beasts

18:17.028 --> 18:20.064
driving by my school,
I'd fantasize

18:20.097 --> 18:22.901
about being behind the wheel,
the road ahead,

18:22.934 --> 18:24.735
and ten tonnes behind me.

18:25.636 --> 18:28.906
And look at me now,
I'm living the dream.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.842
You really are.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.977
You're goddamn right I am.

18:33.010 --> 18:37.615
So, let's have some jazz baby.

18:37.647 --> 18:38.782
Whoo!

19:30.067 --> 19:33.671
"...windswept and
rugged, where a middle-aged Indian man,

19:33.703 --> 19:37.175
frostbitten, with
crimson cheeks and cracked lips,

19:37.207 --> 19:39.743
held a single
thread of gnarled string

19:39.777 --> 19:42.514
attached to an upturned piano.

19:42.547 --> 19:45.517
He stared at it in frustration.

19:45.550 --> 19:49.521
Clearly, the piano
was an ineffective kite."

19:51.856 --> 19:56.160
"The credits rolled
as I cracked up laughing,

19:56.193 --> 19:59.530
the others clapping
in perplexed politeness.

20:00.964 --> 20:02.733
The Q&A was awkward.

20:03.733 --> 20:06.538
As Esme stood
blinded in the spotlight,

20:06.570 --> 20:08.740
I stared at her knee-high boots

20:08.772 --> 20:11.108
and the cheeky hint
of thigh they revealed.

20:11.142 --> 20:12.043
I raised my hand.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.780
'What was your inspiration?'
I asked.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.816
'Good question, ' she lied.

20:19.983 --> 20:22.252
I recognized that look.

20:22.286 --> 20:26.558
The prolonged eye contact,
dilated pupils;

20:26.590 --> 20:30.027
I knew I'd soon gaze upon them
somewhere more comfortable,

20:30.060 --> 20:32.864
her flat mate watching T.V.
in the next room,

20:32.896 --> 20:35.766
superheroes shaking
walls with subwoofers,

20:35.800 --> 20:39.771
conveniently disguising
the ebbs and flows of two girls

20:39.803 --> 20:43.273
making getting-to-know-you
sounds amongst ruffled sheets,

20:43.307 --> 20:45.710
the rough threads
of exposed mattress,

20:45.742 --> 20:47.278
and the sickly-sweet cocktail

20:47.310 --> 20:50.881
of girl sweat and insufficient
air conditioning.

20:50.915 --> 20:55.953
The ineffective kite
was one effective lure."

20:59.823 --> 21:01.625
Thank you so much Jovana,

21:01.658 --> 21:03.261
does anyone have any questions?

21:04.361 --> 21:05.162
Yes?

21:07.897 --> 21:09.166
Hmm.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.908
Thank you so much, Jovana.

21:18.643 --> 21:19.876
You're welcome.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.378
The girl with the red headband

21:21.412 --> 21:22.681
asked me to give you this.

21:29.286 --> 21:30.922
Are you off to your hotel now?

21:32.188 --> 21:33.657
Yes,

21:33.691 --> 21:34.693
the Ramada.

21:36.027 --> 21:37.828
There is a Ramada in Porto?

21:37.861 --> 21:39.697
Uh-huh, it's new.

22:12.195 --> 22:15.800
<i>♪ My heart ♪</i>

22:15.832 --> 22:22.040
<i>♪ Oh, sweet, is there forever ♪</i>

22:24.241 --> 22:28.378
<i>♪ It thrills ♪</i>

22:28.412 --> 22:32.983
<i>♪ With love for thee alone ♪</i>

22:36.052 --> 22:37.821
...A lot of people
are religious, sure,

22:37.855 --> 22:39.257
but nobody cares if you're not.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.291
But if you confessed
in Eastern Sighisoara

22:41.325 --> 22:43.161
that you don't believe
in God, oh,

22:43.194 --> 22:45.963
it's like saying you don't
believe in gravity or something.

22:50.267 --> 22:52.103
Oh, sorry,
do you mind if I take this?

22:52.136 --> 22:54.039
- Of course.
- No, sure, take it.

22:57.007 --> 22:58.309
- Alec?
- Jovana,

22:58.341 --> 23:00.844
look, there's something
you should know.

23:00.877 --> 23:04.147
In today's
Luxembourg Daily News,

23:04.181 --> 23:06.918
there was an article about
a woman reading your book

23:06.951 --> 23:08.819
on a Luxair flight.

23:08.853 --> 23:12.323
Um, she was questioned by
security when she touched down.

23:12.356 --> 23:15.026
Yeah, and then what?

23:15.059 --> 23:16.793
Well, nothing,

23:16.827 --> 23:19.163
it turned out to be just a book,
so they let her go.

23:19.195 --> 23:21.965
But I thought it was
great publicity for you.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.201
Thanks for letting me know,

23:23.233 --> 23:24.901
but I doubt the Luxembourg press

23:24.934 --> 23:26.271
will raise its profile much.

23:27.404 --> 23:28.807
Which language was it in?

23:29.507 --> 23:31.309
Uh, what language,

23:31.341 --> 23:34.311
Amber, what language
was that article in?

23:34.345 --> 23:35.780
Luxembourgish.

23:37.947 --> 23:39.050
Luxembourgish.

23:40.050 --> 23:40.819
Right.

23:44.555 --> 23:47.492
Per capita Luxembourgians
are the second richest

23:47.524 --> 23:49.960
people in the world,
second only to Qatar.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.929
I dare say they can afford
your book, Jovana.

23:52.963 --> 23:56.533
That's not the issue,
a book is hardly a Rolex.

23:56.567 --> 23:59.470
Granted, but expense
is less of a barrier

23:59.502 --> 24:03.840
than ignorance, or dare I say,
apathy.

24:03.874 --> 24:06.444
This is publicity,
this is a good start!

24:07.478 --> 24:09.247
Anyway, I've got to run.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.349
Oh, okay, <i>ciao</i> for now, Jovana.

24:12.383 --> 24:13.417
<i>Ciao.</i>

24:24.494 --> 24:27.197
Thanking you, I'll get you
to sign here, thanks, mate.

24:28.866 --> 24:31.068
So, uh, Jovana,
you mentioned your husband

24:31.100 --> 24:33.170
was an oil rig worker, right?

24:33.203 --> 24:34.271
Uh-huh.

24:34.305 --> 24:35.439
How do you cope with him

24:35.472 --> 24:37.508
being away so often?

24:37.540 --> 24:41.511
The hardest thing is
that the rig is very remote,

24:41.544 --> 24:43.980
so there's
no cell phone reception,

24:44.013 --> 24:45.916
and only senior staff
have internet,

24:45.950 --> 24:49.153
so usually we can chat
on the satellite phone,

24:49.185 --> 24:51.489
but last week their receiver
was damaged in a storm,

24:51.521 --> 24:54.492
and the repairman
only flies in next month.

24:54.524 --> 24:59.262
So, I'll have a crackly-sounding
husband for a while.

24:59.296 --> 25:02.232
But otherwise,
do you make it work?

25:02.265 --> 25:05.235
Well, all things considered,

25:05.269 --> 25:07.438
it's the best arrangement
I could hope for.

25:08.371 --> 25:11.208
He's on the rig for 28 days,
then home for 28,

25:11.242 --> 25:13.444
then away for 28,
then home for 28.

25:13.476 --> 25:18.014
It's not for everyone,
but for us it's perfect.

25:18.048 --> 25:21.286
Every time he returns,
we jump each other.

25:22.586 --> 25:25.189
It's like
he's been away for a year,

25:25.222 --> 25:27.591
and we barely leave
the bedroom all day.

25:28.626 --> 25:31.529
For the next few weeks
we eat at cheap restaurants,

25:31.561 --> 25:33.865
snuggle up on the couch,

25:33.897 --> 25:36.032
buy olives at the market,

25:36.066 --> 25:38.336
holding hands like teenagers.

25:39.536 --> 25:41.939
And before he leaves,

25:41.972 --> 25:45.108
there's always
that bitter-sweet sorrow.

25:46.277 --> 25:48.246
But the weeks go quickly,

25:48.279 --> 25:49.614
and soon we're together again.

25:51.214 --> 25:52.550
I don't know
any other way to live.

25:54.984 --> 25:56.486
Honey,
I think that could work for us.

25:57.588 --> 25:59.155
Irina, I agree.

25:59.188 --> 26:00.590
You need to find
work on an oil rig!

26:37.293 --> 26:38.361
Kitchen.

26:38.395 --> 26:40.463
<i>Hola,</i> Rafael, it's Jovana.

26:40.496 --> 26:43.033
Uh, can I please speak to Theo?

26:43.067 --> 26:45.236
<i>Oi,</i> Theo! It's your lady.

26:47.003 --> 26:48.004
<i>Bonjour,</i> Baby Doll!

26:48.038 --> 26:50.040
<i>Hola, mon amour!</i>

26:50.073 --> 26:53.009
Baby, we're about to dish up,
can I call you back in an hour?

26:53.042 --> 26:54.244
Um...

26:54.278 --> 26:55.479
It's okay, I'm about to sleep,

26:55.511 --> 26:57.147
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

26:58.549 --> 27:00.151
Hey, what's wrong?

27:00.184 --> 27:01.251
You sound a little down.

27:01.284 --> 27:03.486
Um, the bad news

27:03.520 --> 27:06.057
is that Alec
went out of business.

27:06.089 --> 27:07.992
But the good news is
people are talking

27:08.024 --> 27:09.025
about the book in the press.

27:13.297 --> 27:14.732
Baby, I'm sorry,
I can't hear you,

27:14.764 --> 27:17.234
the line's terrible,
this goddamn satellite dish.

27:18.368 --> 27:21.137
Why the hell can't they charter
a chopper for the repairman?

27:21.171 --> 27:24.008
- Cheap bastards, first they cut our pay and now this shit?
- Theo, listen.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.277
The publisher
went out of business.

27:26.309 --> 27:28.279
I am running out
of money very quickly

27:28.311 --> 27:30.246
and you know we cannot
get a credit card

27:30.280 --> 27:32.016
after the rent fiasco.

27:32.049 --> 27:35.153
What?

27:36.453 --> 27:39.156
Baby, I can't hear, can I call
you back in an hour? I'm sorry.

27:40.124 --> 27:42.360
I need to sleep anyway,
we, we can try again soon.

27:42.393 --> 27:44.761
Wait, what?

27:44.794 --> 27:47.197
I said we...

27:47.231 --> 27:48.031
Fuck!

27:49.299 --> 27:50.100
Jovana!

32:54.971 --> 32:56.674
"The longest time I'd spent

32:56.706 --> 32:58.908
between meeting, meeting
a girl for the first time

32:58.942 --> 33:00.411
and eating her pussy

33:00.444 --> 33:01.479
was 18 years;

33:03.446 --> 33:05.482
I met Katherine at school,

33:05.514 --> 33:07.784
but we didn't get
together until we were 30.

33:08.851 --> 33:10.787
The shortest time was with Bree,

33:11.821 --> 33:13.690
it took seconds.

33:13.723 --> 33:15.358
We'd chatted online for weeks,

33:15.392 --> 33:17.595
and messages turned flirty,

33:18.528 --> 33:19.797
then dirty.

33:20.963 --> 33:24.467
Upon our earliest face-to-face
meeting at my doorstep,

33:24.501 --> 33:28.439
we were kissing
with frenzied passion

33:29.373 --> 33:30.841
before she'd laid down
her purse.

33:35.979 --> 33:37.815
I took her hand,

33:37.848 --> 33:39.582
led her into my room,

33:39.616 --> 33:42.519
and before
a single minute had passed,

33:42.551 --> 33:45.488
I lifted her skirt,
and plunged my tongue

33:45.521 --> 33:48.091
deep inside her dripping,
wet cunt."

34:07.944 --> 34:09.011
<i>What's up, hungry homies?</i>

34:09.043 --> 34:10.481
<i>Theo and ol' Raphael here</i>

34:10.513 --> 34:11.514
<i>busy cooking up the best</i>

34:11.547 --> 34:12.716
<i>honey-smoked mackerel</i>

34:12.748 --> 34:13.649
<i>in this side of Soho.</i>

34:13.681 --> 34:14.751
<i>Leave us a message!</i>

34:32.902 --> 34:36.072
<i>Oh, hi, Jovana,
what a lovely surprise, how are you?</i>

34:36.106 --> 34:37.808
I'm well, thanks, Ksenia.

34:37.841 --> 34:39.743
My flight's delayed, so

34:39.775 --> 34:41.511
I thought I'd just run
something by you,

34:41.543 --> 34:42.646
do you have a moment?

34:42.678 --> 34:44.981
<i>Um, sure! Go ahead.</i>

34:45.014 --> 34:48.152
Yeah, uh,
about the radio interview,

34:48.185 --> 34:51.088
I was, uh, wondering, um,

34:51.120 --> 34:52.487
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Yes.

34:52.522 --> 34:54.091
I was wondering, uh,

34:54.123 --> 34:56.525
what is the expected audience?

34:56.560 --> 35:01.632
Do they want short snappy
anecdotes, or deep analysis?

35:01.664 --> 35:04.667
<i>A bit of both,
anyone who reads books really.</i>

35:04.700 --> 35:06.102
Oh, great, okay.

35:06.135 --> 35:08.705
Also, I wanted to know, um...

35:09.705 --> 35:10.973
<i>Yes?</i>

35:11.006 --> 35:13.876
Okay, I confess,
I just rang to talk,

35:13.910 --> 35:16.013
but that's socially unacceptable

35:16.046 --> 35:18.714
after about age 14,
so I said the radio thing.

35:18.747 --> 35:22.218
<i>Oh, silly,
you can ring me to talk!</i>

35:22.252 --> 35:24.988
Yeah? Really?
You don't think that's awkward?

35:25.021 --> 35:27.223
<i>Not in the slightest,
it's nice actually,</i>

35:27.256 --> 35:29.725
<i>I can hear
your mellifluous voice.</i>

35:29.758 --> 35:33.062
You know,
when you said the other day

35:33.095 --> 35:34.931
that you liked my voice,
I was too shy

35:34.964 --> 35:36.600
to return the compliment.

35:37.633 --> 35:39.235
<i>Sorry, Jovana, I've got
to deal with something here,</i>

35:39.269 --> 35:40.169
<i>Can we chat later?</i>

35:40.202 --> 35:42.538
Oh, oh, okay.

35:42.571 --> 35:45.075
- <i>Enjoy your galivanting.</i>
- Galivanting?

35:45.107 --> 35:47.077
Why you know
all the best words.

35:47.109 --> 35:48.878
<i>I really must go, bye.</i>

35:48.912 --> 35:50.580
Okay, okay, sure, yes, okay.

36:43.633 --> 36:45.602
"So for
the first time in a year,

36:45.635 --> 36:48.906
I stepped inside an actual
brick and mortar post office.

36:48.939 --> 36:51.008
With a door and a queue.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.975
And a randomly curated
assortment

36:53.008 --> 36:55.912
of overpriced stuffed toys
in red Christmas hats.

36:57.781 --> 37:00.317
In my early days
as an aspiring writer,

37:00.350 --> 37:03.819
I'd post something
to someone somewhere daily.

37:03.852 --> 37:07.823
I'd lick a small rectangle
covered with sweet adhesive gum,

37:07.856 --> 37:11.561
and attach it to a larger
white rectangle.

37:11.595 --> 37:13.964
This ritual went unquestioned.

37:13.997 --> 37:15.765
A mere two decades later,

37:15.798 --> 37:17.733
it seems like something
my great grandmother

37:17.767 --> 37:19.770
would have done
between milking a cow

37:19.803 --> 37:21.705
and sewing her own napkins.

37:22.638 --> 37:26.108
A woman next to me
held a large cardboard box.

37:26.142 --> 37:28.678
She was top-heavy
like an improper fraction,

37:28.711 --> 37:31.047
with long burgundy hair,

37:31.080 --> 37:32.982
and fingernails a shade
I'd later learn

37:33.015 --> 37:36.118
was called 'Profondo Rosso.'

37:36.151 --> 37:39.021
Her faint,
cheeky smile was familiar

37:39.055 --> 37:42.693
yet distant somehow, like
viewing a <i>Mona Lisa</i> photocopy

37:42.725 --> 37:44.595
from across a smoky room.

37:45.694 --> 37:47.164
She had a pen.

37:47.196 --> 37:49.332
I asked if I could borrow it.

37:49.365 --> 37:52.368
That night we ate
<i>Hokkien Mee</i> in Chinatown,

37:52.401 --> 37:56.238
and drank 2-for-1 <i>Tsingtao</i>
beers in a karaoke bar,

37:56.272 --> 37:57.774
the buzz of attraction

37:57.807 --> 38:00.977
adding zest
to mass-market mouthwash.

38:01.010 --> 38:04.614
By midnight, we were like
circus contortionists,

38:04.647 --> 38:06.649
devouring each other
on the back seat

38:06.682 --> 38:09.385
of her Hello Kitty-upholstered
Daihatsu Mira,

38:09.419 --> 38:12.122
serenaded by Christmas
songs on endless repeat

38:12.155 --> 38:14.256
in the Westfield carpark.

38:14.289 --> 38:18.227
To this day, I can't smell
Calvin Klein Euphoria

38:18.260 --> 38:20.863
without Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer

38:20.897 --> 38:22.165
dashing through my head."

38:23.399 --> 38:24.700
<i>Danke.</i>

38:28.905 --> 38:30.374
The cabbie rolls
down his window and yells,

38:30.406 --> 38:34.077
"Oi, knob face!
She's too fucking tall for ya!"

38:42.118 --> 38:43.253
It's on me pimps.

38:43.285 --> 38:45.254
- <i>Danke schön.</i>
- <i>Danke.</i>

38:45.287 --> 38:46.990
You're not having a
beer, Francis?

38:47.022 --> 38:49.059
No, I only drink beer
in the shower.

38:49.091 --> 38:50.660
What?

38:50.693 --> 38:54.096
Hot water, cold brew. Tight.

38:56.131 --> 38:57.934
So, Jovana,
in real life do you...

39:00.437 --> 39:01.672
Do I?

39:03.073 --> 39:05.341
...um, drink <i>Tsingtao</i> beer?

39:05.374 --> 39:08.277
Or was that just fiction?

39:08.310 --> 39:10.247
Are you really
asking me about beer?

39:22.725 --> 39:24.694
Yeah!

39:32.135 --> 39:37.174
<i>♪ Don't worry girl

39:37.207 --> 39:41.345

39:56.191 --> 39:59.061
- Like a fucking pimp!
- Yeah!

40:00.497 --> 40:02.199
Okay, your turn, pick a country.

40:02.231 --> 40:05.267
Um, let's see,

40:05.301 --> 40:07.471
the Dominican Republic!

40:07.504 --> 40:09.973
- Nice, now pick a kitchen utensil.
- Ah!

40:11.073 --> 40:13.443
- Salt shaker!
- Perfect!

40:13.475 --> 40:16.780
"The Dominican Salt Shaker"!

40:16.812 --> 40:19.482
Ah, okay, but how do you do it?

40:19.515 --> 40:21.218
Ooh, okay, uh, let's see.

40:21.251 --> 40:25.055
Maybe you cum in her ass,
then shake dandruff on her face!

40:27.490 --> 40:29.158
Your turn, country?

40:29.191 --> 40:30.760
Um, Bulgaria.

40:30.794 --> 40:32.328
Kitchen utensil?

40:32.361 --> 40:33.430
Spatula.

40:33.463 --> 40:35.531
The Bulgarian Spatula!

40:40.569 --> 40:45.809
Ah, thank you so much Francis,
for the lift

40:45.841 --> 40:47.810
and for taking care of the bill.

40:47.843 --> 40:50.179
- No problem.
- Come on.

40:51.580 --> 40:54.450
What? What are you doing?

40:54.484 --> 40:56.987
- Come on, no!
- Shh!

40:57.019 --> 41:01.123
- No, what the fuck!
- Come on, baby.

41:31.421 --> 41:33.223
And that's the tour.

41:33.256 --> 41:35.225
Remote controls are over there.

41:35.258 --> 41:37.528
You seem smart. I'm pretty sure
you can work them out.

41:39.428 --> 41:41.497
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

41:41.531 --> 41:42.999
If you're afraid of dogs,
I assure you

41:43.031 --> 41:45.535
Tom's less dangerous
than a kitchen sponge.

41:45.568 --> 41:46.970
Eat whatever's in the fridge,

41:47.002 --> 41:48.238
there's a heap of frozen meals

41:48.271 --> 41:49.872
in the freezer,
just help yourself.

41:49.906 --> 41:51.274
- Oh, no I wouldn't.
- Don't be silly,

41:51.307 --> 41:52.908
I get them delivered
and there's always too many,

41:52.941 --> 41:55.077
so I end up giving half
to the homeless.

41:55.111 --> 41:57.981
There's a well-stacked
book shelf upstairs.

41:58.013 --> 42:00.115
Feel free to open
a bottle of wine,

42:00.149 --> 42:01.417
maybe except
the Marius Symphony,

42:01.450 --> 42:03.285
a gift from
my dear friend Roger.

42:03.318 --> 42:05.221
That's about it,
I've got to run.

42:05.254 --> 42:06.923
Uh, I'll probably be
back in the wee hours,

42:06.955 --> 42:08.892
so, make yourself at home,

42:08.925 --> 42:10.126

43:14.022 --> 43:17.093
And Tommy kept me company again.

43:17.126 --> 43:18.194
Funny you say that, Jovana.

43:20.196 --> 43:23.667
You've been the perfect guest
these past few days,

43:23.700 --> 43:26.403
so, how would you
feel about staying longer?

43:27.437 --> 43:29.172
Staying longer?

43:29.205 --> 43:32.242
I'm flying to Reykjavik
for three months tomorrow.

43:32.274 --> 43:35.311
Tommy doesn't like many people,
but he's really taken to you.

43:37.245 --> 43:40.282
I was planning to drop him
off at the doggy hotel, but...

43:40.316 --> 43:42.419
if you like,
I could pay you to dog sit.

43:42.452 --> 43:43.352
What do you say?

43:44.519 --> 43:46.022
Here? For three months?

43:47.122 --> 43:48.624
Correct.

43:48.658 --> 43:50.260
And you'll pay me?

43:51.093 --> 43:52.461
Well, it won't pay much,
but enough to cover

43:52.495 --> 43:53.497
your rent in Paris.

43:54.763 --> 43:56.232
So you'll break even at least.

44:02.472 --> 44:04.307
That's a very
generous offer, Harry.

44:10.780 --> 44:12.716
But I have to catch
a flight to Budapest today.

so you're welcome to have
a coffee in the green room,

44:52.354 --> 44:56.059
or listen on the preceding
presentations.

44:56.091 --> 44:59.128
But I warn you,
they might sound a tad bookish.

44:59.162 --> 45:00.330
And some are in Hungarian.

45:00.363 --> 45:01.765
It's okay, I'll listen in,

45:01.798 --> 45:03.399
maybe I'll learn something.

45:03.432 --> 45:05.234
Okay, great, that way.

45:32.794 --> 45:36.698
The epistemology that informs
phenomenological methodology

45:36.731 --> 45:41.136
must be either objectivism
or constructivism.

45:41.169 --> 45:43.807
Epistemology studies
the nature, creation

45:43.839 --> 45:46.408
and dissemination of knowledge...

45:46.441 --> 45:48.243
<i>Köszönöm.</i>

45:48.276 --> 45:50.280
Before we get started,
I have to confess

45:50.312 --> 45:52.714
what I was doing
during the last presentation.

45:52.747 --> 45:55.651
I was looking up
a few words from the topic,

45:55.685 --> 45:58.855
namely "auto-ethnography,"

45:58.888 --> 46:00.790
"constructivism,"

46:00.823 --> 46:05.395
"epistemology," "hermeneutic"
and "phenomenology."

46:06.761 --> 46:08.832
Either Hungarians
are really smart,

46:08.865 --> 46:11.568
or I'm the victim
of a hidden camera prank.

46:13.836 --> 46:16.606
But then the taxi driver

46:16.638 --> 46:18.575
sticks his head out the window,
and yells,

46:18.607 --> 46:21.845
"Oi, knob face!
She's too fucking tall for ya!"

46:21.877 --> 46:25.147
Yeah, right,
it's that type of absurdism

46:25.180 --> 46:26.615
you'd expect from Murakami.

46:26.649 --> 46:28.852
Though with fewer talking cats.

46:40.595 --> 46:43.165
If you don't have Forint
you can give me 30 Euros.

46:53.508 --> 46:55.644
Right, so,
uh, where are we going?

46:55.678 --> 46:57.647
Should we hit the Buddha Bar?

46:57.680 --> 47:01.518
No, too many wanna-be pornstars.

47:01.551 --> 47:04.287
How about Tuk Tuk?
Do you like cocktails, Jovana?

47:05.220 --> 47:08.457
Actually, I, I think
I must get back to my hotel.

47:08.490 --> 47:11.193
- I have a lot to organize before I fly tomorrow.
- No!

47:11.227 --> 47:13.863
Yeah, but it's been great
to meet you all, really,

47:13.896 --> 47:15.798
and thank you, Eva,
stay in touch.

47:17.566 --> 47:18.734
Nice to meet you.

47:18.767 --> 47:21.170
Yeah! Have fun!

49:49.051 --> 49:50.653
- Allo.
- Allo.

49:50.685 --> 49:53.656
- Thanks so much.
- Hello.

50:21.517 --> 50:23.986
<i>Can you describe for us

50:24.019 --> 50:27.790
It's every writer's

50:27.823 --> 50:31.127
Each morning I eat
black caviar for breakfast,

50:31.160 --> 50:36.366
bathe in sparkling Perrier,
and have my personal sculptor

50:36.399 --> 50:39.969
carve dolphins from a cube
of Greenlandic ice.

51:09.698 --> 51:11.968
<i>No, it's true!
I don't even know what you look like!</i>

51:12.001 --> 51:13.669
<i>Does that matter?</i>

51:13.702 --> 51:15.504
<i>That's uneven!</i>

51:15.537 --> 51:16.905
<i>You know what I look like,</i>

51:16.939 --> 51:18.808
<i>because I'm on the back
of the book,</i>

51:18.841 --> 51:22.044
<i>but I googled you, and there's
a million women with your name.</i>

51:22.077 --> 51:24.513
<i>It's a common name.
But why would you care</i>

51:24.546 --> 51:26.415
<i>how I look anyway?</i>

51:26.448 --> 51:28.450
<i>What,
are you some kind of monster?</i>

51:29.885 --> 51:31.486
<i>It doesn't matter,</i>

51:31.519 --> 51:33.588
<i>I'm really looking
forward to meeting you,</i>

51:33.622 --> 51:35.124
<i>even if you do look like Shrek!</i>

51:50.071 --> 51:53.209
And then he said,
"Where is my fish?"

52:01.550 --> 52:02.952
- Kitchen.
- <i>Hola, mon amour.</i>

52:02.984 --> 52:05.120
Aww, Baby Cakes! How are you?

52:05.153 --> 52:07.022
Theo! I need your help!
I need money!

52:07.055 --> 52:08.957
Oh, no.

52:09.992 --> 52:11.560
This phone's still
a piece of shit, what?

52:13.127 --> 52:14.830
Wha... How's the tour?

52:15.930 --> 52:18.033
Alec went bankrupt.
I've been trying to tell you

52:18.066 --> 52:20.802
but the phone,
the phone keeps cutting out.

52:20.836 --> 52:22.839
I have been hitchhiking
everywhere...

52:22.872 --> 52:24.507
...stranger's mattresses.

52:24.539 --> 52:26.541
Baby, did you, did you say
"stranger's mattresses"?

52:28.977 --> 52:32.781
Do we have anything in the bank
somehow, somewhere?

52:32.814 --> 52:34.517
Baby.

52:36.952 --> 52:38.955
Why can't they fix
this fucking phone, dude?

52:38.988 --> 52:39.955
I don't understand.

52:39.988 --> 52:41.156
Baby, what?

52:42.091 --> 52:43.259
Hello?

52:43.292 --> 52:44.127
Jovana?

52:45.528 --> 52:47.129
Shit.

52:50.131 --> 52:52.167
Throwing the phone
will not fix the problem.

52:52.200 --> 52:54.669
If I can't throw the phone,
I'll throw you! How's that?

52:54.702 --> 52:56.705
Throwing me
will hurt your shoulder.

52:59.774 --> 53:00.577
Try this.

53:09.984 --> 53:10.819
Better?

53:12.086 --> 53:13.222
A little, thank you.

53:21.030 --> 53:22.231
<i>What's up, hungry homies?</i>

53:22.263 --> 53:24.133

<i>Leave us a message!</i>

53:30.872 --> 53:32.742
like it does every fucking time.

53:32.774 --> 53:35.211
If you somehow receive
this message,

53:35.243 --> 53:37.747
can you try to call me back?

53:37.780 --> 53:41.050
Bribe your boss to,
to use the internet.

53:41.082 --> 53:43.184
I know we don't have
any savings, but maybe

53:43.218 --> 53:46.254
your work can give you
an advance or something?

53:46.287 --> 53:48.724
Let me know. Okay? <i>Je t'aime.</i>

53:52.127 --> 53:54.163

53:54.196 --> 53:55.832
twenty euro.

53:56.966 --> 53:58.001
It not much.

54:00.836 --> 54:04.941
You maybe buy little bit food.

54:04.973 --> 54:06.809
No, I couldn't possibly...

54:07.743 --> 54:09.045
Please.

54:09.077 --> 54:09.945
I have job.

54:11.647 --> 54:12.248
Take.

54:15.216 --> 54:16.218
Thank you.

54:18.187 --> 54:19.088
You are welcome.

54:33.102 --> 54:37.239
"Katja and I had a
lost weekend in a hotel in Budapest.

54:37.272 --> 54:40.877
Only a twin room was available,
so we pushed two beds together.

54:41.810 --> 54:44.347
As I felt myself slipping
between mattresses,

54:44.379 --> 54:46.682
Katja narrated the scene

54:46.714 --> 54:49.084
her lover falling down
a huge crevasse,

54:49.118 --> 54:50.853
necessitating a search party

54:50.885 --> 54:53.822
of specially-trained
sniffer dogs raised from birth

54:53.856 --> 54:56.859
to descend the slippery
slopes of crisp white linen.

54:57.892 --> 54:59.361
Too lazy to do dishes,

54:59.394 --> 55:01.964
we ate Crunchy Nut
Corn Flakes from cups.

55:03.198 --> 55:04.734
Katja went to make coffee,

55:04.767 --> 55:07.002
and returned to find me
hugging a pillow.

55:07.035 --> 55:08.970
She stood there, naked,

55:09.004 --> 55:12.074
French press in hand,
and feigned admonishment.

55:12.106 --> 55:15.844
'I'm gone five minutes,
and you've already found someone else?'

55:15.877 --> 55:19.749
Sunrise, and she woke me
with her tongue between my legs.

55:19.781 --> 55:22.184
When we finally spoke, I asked,

55:22.216 --> 55:24.819
'Is that how you
always say good morning?'

55:24.852 --> 55:26.088
She replied, 'Yes,

55:26.120 --> 55:27.756
it can be awkward
when I bump into friends

55:27.789 --> 55:28.690
on the bus.'"

55:30.892 --> 55:33.662
"Katja found a job
as an in-house typographer

55:33.696 --> 55:36.098
in an agency in Dublin.

55:36.131 --> 55:38.267
I said goodbye
at the departure lounge

55:38.300 --> 55:40.702
clutching an overpriced
caramel latte.

55:40.736 --> 55:43.306
I said, 'Don't be a stranger.'

55:44.372 --> 55:48.943
She kissed my hand, winked,
and disappeared through customs.

55:48.977 --> 55:51.714
I went home,
watched <i>Dirty Dancing,</i>

55:51.747 --> 55:53.683
and ate cereal from a mug."

55:55.117 --> 55:56.419
<i>Efcharistó.</i>

56:00.122 --> 56:01.190
Thank you, Jovana.

56:01.222 --> 56:03.258
That was very enjoyable.

56:04.193 --> 56:07.430
I have many comments,
but I will open it to the floor.

56:07.463 --> 56:09.932
- Anyone have a question, yes?
- Yes.

56:09.964 --> 56:11.434
Hello, Jovana.

56:11.466 --> 56:13.968
I'm, I'm Elias from
the <i>Traveling Book Buff.</i>

56:14.002 --> 56:16.673
I'm pretty sure that you've
heard of my channel before?

56:18.807 --> 56:19.709
No?

56:21.843 --> 56:23.412
Really?

56:23.444 --> 56:25.747
Oh, ha-ha, okay.

56:25.781 --> 56:27.750
Well, I just have
one question for you.

56:27.783 --> 56:31.487
That's, um,
is your book autobiographical?

56:31.519 --> 56:34.322
We are maybe getting
a little personal there.

56:34.356 --> 56:35.323
Jovana?

56:35.356 --> 56:36.958
Um, <i>American Psycho</i>

56:36.992 --> 56:37.993
got inside the mind

56:38.026 --> 56:39.428
of a serial killer, but

56:39.461 --> 56:41.997
do you think Bret Easton Ellis

56:42.030 --> 56:44.767
actually chopped up
women with an axe?

56:44.800 --> 56:47.002
Let me just say,
I am happily married.

56:47.035 --> 56:50.372
Well, that's a very smart
way of dodging a question,

56:50.405 --> 56:54.243
but I find it very disingenuous
to mislead your readers...

56:54.276 --> 56:56.511
- That's enough.
- My followers need to know!

56:56.544 --> 56:59.814
Sir! Sir,
you're being disruptive.

56:59.847 --> 57:01.149
I think you should leave.

57:01.182 --> 57:03.418
This is censorship, seriously!

57:11.827 --> 57:12.962
I don't...

57:12.995 --> 57:13.763
I don't speak Greek,

57:13.796 --> 57:15.097
but I kind
of get your point, yeah?

57:17.265 --> 57:19.068
Um, Jovana, I'm just saying,

57:19.100 --> 57:20.769
I'm never going to model
for Calvin Klein

57:20.803 --> 57:22.338
like Tiny Banderas over here,

57:22.370 --> 57:23.772
but I'm going
to front my videos,

57:23.805 --> 57:25.173
not hide behind a facade.

57:36.285 --> 57:37.787
My apologies, everybody.

57:52.466 --> 57:55.271

Okay, the big

58:00.408 --> 58:02.510

Sorry about the mattress.

58:41.182 --> 58:43.351
We had an foam one but, uh,

58:43.385 --> 58:44.553
the dog pissed on it.

58:46.120 --> 58:47.455
There.

58:47.488 --> 58:48.557
You have a dog?

58:49.624 --> 58:50.458
No.

58:54.629 --> 58:58.334
I, uh, sorry to pry,
but, uh, are you an author?

58:58.367 --> 59:00.069
Yes.

59:00.102 --> 59:01.904
I don't suppose
you wrote a book called, uh,

59:01.937 --> 59:03.539
<i>Don't Read This In The Air?</i>

59:03.571 --> 59:06.107
<i>Don't Read This On A Plane,</i>
yes.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.409
I thought so, I watched
a review of it today,

59:08.443 --> 59:09.611
so your face is familiar.

59:09.644 --> 59:11.946
Oh, good to know.

59:11.979 --> 59:15.283
- So, is it true?
- Is what true?

59:15.316 --> 59:17.552
- That you, uh...
- That I?

59:17.586 --> 59:20.189
That you're, you know,

59:20.222 --> 59:22.258
intentionally being
controversial

59:22.290 --> 59:23.258
to, uh...

59:29.964 --> 59:31.367
Court publicity.

59:33.035 --> 59:35.004
...to court publicity.

59:35.037 --> 59:36.437
Is it true?

59:36.470 --> 59:38.306
You mean,
is it autobiographical?

59:38.339 --> 59:40.309
No! I don't care
about the sexy stuff.

59:40.341 --> 59:43.678
Come on!
What year is this? 1955?

59:43.711 --> 59:45.347
But apparently,

59:45.379 --> 59:48.117
there's a bit
in the book that's designed

59:48.149 --> 59:50.618
to get someone arrested
if they read it on a plane.

59:51.687 --> 59:52.922
That's just a joke,

59:52.955 --> 59:54.156
nobody would take it seriously,

59:54.189 --> 59:55.091
surely.

59:57.392 --> 59:59.395
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

59:59.428 --> 01:00:02.164
Anyway, bathroom's here,

01:00:02.196 --> 01:00:03.899

Jovana!

This is Alec!
Have you heard the news?

01:00:28.423 --> 01:00:31.660
It's happened again,
only this time in The States.

01:00:31.693 --> 01:00:33.461
This could be
the big breakthrough!

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:36.731
What news?

01:00:36.765 --> 01:00:39.201
I, I'm sending you the link,
have a look.

01:00:39.234 --> 01:00:42.304
Uh, I just woke up,
can you read it to me?

01:00:42.336 --> 01:00:46.742
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay,
so, so, the headline is

01:00:46.774 --> 01:00:50.479
"Woman Questioned
For Reading Book on Plane.

01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:53.348
A woman on a Jet Blue
flight from Atlanta to Denver

01:00:53.381 --> 01:00:57.285
was met by anti-terrorism
officials upon disembarking.

01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:59.721
Sources indicate
she was reading a book titled

01:00:59.754 --> 01:01:04.425
<i>Don't Read This On A Plane</i> by
Paris-based novelist Jovana Fey.

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:07.162
The book contains a,"
blah-blah-blah,

01:01:07.194 --> 01:01:09.397
it goes on to describe
the offending passage

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.566
and says she was released
without charge.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.337
Not much of a story,
but fantastic publicity!

01:01:15.703 --> 01:01:17.339
Cool!

01:01:17.372 --> 01:01:20.274
Yeah, cool, cool, cool,
indeed, yeah!

01:01:20.307 --> 01:01:22.744
Only I think today's youth
would call it "sick"!

01:01:22.778 --> 01:01:26.615
And semantics aside,
this is what we needed, Jovana.

01:01:27.783 --> 01:01:30.586
What do you mean "we," Alec?
You're no longer the publisher.

01:01:32.386 --> 01:01:33.289
You're right.

01:01:35.156 --> 01:01:36.325
I'm just saying,

01:01:37.392 --> 01:01:39.428
as a friend,

01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:42.031
you should make the most of it.

01:01:42.064 --> 01:01:43.432
Because this, my dear,

01:01:43.464 --> 01:01:45.633
is what success feels like.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:48.371
This is what you've been working
for your whole lifetime.

01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:50.238
So,

01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:52.441
take a look around and,

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:55.644
breathe the air and,

01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:57.412
soak up the moment!

01:02:11.193 --> 01:02:13.562
Thank you Alec, all the best.

"I met Harriet
in a retro bar in Montreal.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.736
She said she had
dental floss stuck in her teeth,

01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:02.871
but was enjoying the irony.

01:04:04.573 --> 01:04:06.308
She was a petite Australian

01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:07.943
with a pierced lip, green hair,

01:04:07.975 --> 01:04:10.412
and a tattoo of a walrus
on her left buttock.

01:04:11.379 --> 01:04:13.649
When I asked whether
she were a John Lennon fan,

01:04:13.682 --> 01:04:16.651
she said, 'Not really, I just
reckon walruses are cool.'"

01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:18.819
"She played jokes

01:04:18.852 --> 01:04:20.621
whenever an opportunity knocked,

01:04:20.655 --> 01:04:23.691
from burning my lips with
weapons-grade ghost peppers,

01:04:23.725 --> 01:04:26.795
to pretending to be
a stranger on public transport

01:04:26.827 --> 01:04:29.297
before showing inappropriate
levels of affection."

01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:34.368
"Prior to my departure
from a recent rendezvous,

01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:36.338
she scribbled a note
in my journal.

01:04:37.305 --> 01:04:40.776
I went to read it, but
she said to save it for the air.

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:44.312
Mid-flight, I opened the page
at the bookmark she'd placed.

01:04:45.312 --> 01:04:47.950
Five words,
my heart skipped a beat,

01:04:47.982 --> 01:04:50.919
and I slammed the pages
together in a mad panic.

01:04:50.952 --> 01:04:53.789
Regaining my composure,
if not my breath,

01:04:53.821 --> 01:04:56.357
I slowly opened
the book for another look,

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:57.658
there I saw it..."

my new life in Guantanamo Bay,

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.977
I finally
understood the walrus tattoo,

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:17.646
tamed, they can perform
tricks at Seaworld,

01:05:17.678 --> 01:05:19.314
like the spectacle of a dainty,

a windowless Montreal speakeasy.

But turn your back,

01:07:06.488 --> 01:07:09.491
And, Jovana, I need
to provide for you better,

01:07:09.524 --> 01:07:11.493
I know that,
and I promise you, baby, I will.

01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:13.694
Okay, I'm going to come through for you.
When I open my restaurant

01:07:13.727 --> 01:07:15.430
it'll be a huge success and
I'll take care of everything.

01:07:15.463 --> 01:07:17.932
Okay, Theo,
save your breath, okay,

01:07:17.966 --> 01:07:19.468
I'm so fucking tired
of this shit.

01:07:30.178 --> 01:07:31.046
Fuck!

01:07:47.861 --> 01:07:49.764
<i>Oh, hello there,</i>

01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:53.100
<i>calling me again in the wee
hours of the morning?</i>

01:07:53.133 --> 01:07:55.936
I just rang
to talk if that's okay?

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.473
<i>Yeah, of course it's okay!</i>

01:07:59.506 --> 01:08:04.578
Okay, so are you all
prepared for my reading?

01:08:04.611 --> 01:08:06.180
<i>Of course.</i>

01:08:06.214 --> 01:08:08.083
<i>Though my bookstore
isn't big enough,</i>

01:08:08.115 --> 01:08:11.018
<i>so we're moving
to another venue.</i>

01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:12.887
What? That's great news.

01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:15.189
I have to start
charging an appearance fee.

01:08:16.557 --> 01:08:19.127
<i>Well, we're a small operation</i>

01:08:19.158 --> 01:08:22.796
<i>but I can probably find
a way to reward you.</i>

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:25.667
Oh, my God,
it sounds rather suggestive.

01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:29.970
<i>I will neither confirm
nor deny that intention.</i>

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:33.006
<i>But, uh, you don't know
what I look like, remember?</i>

01:08:34.107 --> 01:08:37.645
<i>I could be hideous.</i>

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:39.814
You don't sound hideous.

01:08:39.846 --> 01:08:41.682
<i>A voice can be deceiving.</i>

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:44.653
<i>I once spoke with a publisher's
intern on the phone,</i>

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:46.955
<i>she had a beautiful,
chirpy voice,</i>

01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:50.524
<i>and I pictured her wearing
a yellow summer dress</i>

01:08:50.557 --> 01:08:52.526
<i>and a white hair ribbon.</i>

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.761
<i>When we met,</i>

01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:57.665
<i>she had dreadlocks and horns.</i>

01:08:57.698 --> 01:08:58.934
Horns?

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:02.037
<i>She had implants under her skin.</i>

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:04.538
Yuck!

01:09:04.571 --> 01:09:06.640
<i>But she spoke like
the voiceover girl</i>

01:09:06.673 --> 01:09:08.642
<i>on a toothpaste commercial,</i>

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:12.948
<i>and soon we'd share lemon tea
without me even noticing.</i>

01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:14.948
And then she went home

01:09:14.982 --> 01:09:18.551
and carved a pentagram
into a kitten's forehead.

01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:25.027
<i>Jovana?</i>

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:27.029
Yes?

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:31.200
<i>Did you sleep
with all those women?</i>

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.903
If I did,
would that make me a slut?

01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:37.837
<i>Maybe it's time we admit</i>

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:41.743
<i>that everyone's a bit of a slut.</i>

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:44.678
<i>But you're just
a little sluttier.</i>

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.982
Oh! I'd slap your face
if I had longer arms.

01:11:03.056 --> 01:11:04.358
Nice to meet you, finally.

01:11:06.628 --> 01:11:08.163
So now I know how you look like.

01:11:12.766 --> 01:11:15.369
I gave the jar
to my client Frederik,

01:11:15.403 --> 01:11:18.339
explaining explicitly

01:11:18.373 --> 01:11:23.011
that it's to be spread very
thinly on toast, with butter.

01:11:23.043 --> 01:11:24.311
But that gets
lost in translation

01:11:24.345 --> 01:11:26.280
when I'm invited
over for dinner,

01:11:26.314 --> 01:11:29.950
and Frederik's wife brings
it out with the barbecue pork.

01:11:29.984 --> 01:11:33.221
She unscrews the jar,

01:11:33.253 --> 01:11:36.190
scoops a big Vegemite
dollop onto her plate,

01:11:36.223 --> 01:11:38.760
and dabs the meat into it like

01:11:38.793 --> 01:11:40.629
dirty black mustard.

01:11:40.662 --> 01:11:41.997
I didn't want her
to feel stupid,

01:11:42.029 --> 01:11:43.631
so I did the same,

01:11:43.664 --> 01:11:46.301
as did Frederik
and the other guests.

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:50.771
No one was eating this black
sludge because they wanted to.

01:11:50.805 --> 01:11:53.807
We were all doing it
for the sake of someone else.

01:11:55.776 --> 01:11:57.345
Sorry, I'm waffling.

01:11:57.378 --> 01:11:58.714
No, not at all.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.115
I think it's a lovely story.

01:12:02.784 --> 01:12:04.286
It calls for a toast.

01:12:07.187 --> 01:12:10.290
So, here's for not doing things

01:12:10.324 --> 01:12:11.793
just to please others.

01:12:36.117 --> 01:12:38.119
There are not many left.

01:12:38.151 --> 01:12:40.454
Do you want to give them
a link to the e-book?

01:12:40.488 --> 01:12:41.823
Uh, whatever you like.

01:12:45.793 --> 01:12:47.295
Sorry, um,

01:12:48.395 --> 01:12:51.298
maybe we get an intern
to do the reading?

01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:54.002
There are hungry hoards
out there awaiting your wisdom.

01:12:54.034 --> 01:12:55.769
I heard, um,

01:12:55.802 --> 01:12:59.940
there's a waterpark
with nice jacuzzies and stuff.

01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:08.850
This has been fun.

01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:28.803
<i>Multumesc.</i>

01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:30.806
Thank you so much.

01:13:35.243 --> 01:13:37.178
Chapter 67,

01:13:37.211 --> 01:13:38.245
"Lorraine.

01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:42.417
I first met Lorraine

01:13:42.449 --> 01:13:46.320
at the frozen quiche section
at the Huntington Supermarket.

01:13:49.257 --> 01:13:50.158
And..."

01:13:58.431 --> 01:13:59.400
You know what?

01:14:01.235 --> 01:14:02.370
Let's get back to Lorraine
in a minute,

01:14:02.403 --> 01:14:04.004
but first
I want to say a few words.

01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:09.042
Whenever I do a reading,
someone inevitably asks

01:14:09.075 --> 01:14:12.480
whether <i>Don't Read This On A
Plane</i> is autobiographical,

01:14:12.512 --> 01:14:14.149
did I sleep
with a hundred women?

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.418
I've dodged the question

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:18.852
in public,

01:14:18.886 --> 01:14:20.187
and in private,

01:14:20.221 --> 01:14:22.257
trying to hold onto the mystique

01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:23.490
a non-answer generates,

01:14:23.524 --> 01:14:25.827
because mystique
translates into sales.

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.096
And I need to sell
books to survive.

01:14:29.297 --> 01:14:31.399
But this whole charade
has weighed me down, so...

01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:34.136
I'm going
to answer the question.

01:14:37.038 --> 01:14:39.374
Is <i>Don't Read This On A Plane</i>
autobiographical?

01:14:43.276 --> 01:14:44.078
Yes.

01:14:45.346 --> 01:14:46.314
Absolutely.

01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:53.421
I have indeed slept
with a hundred or so women.

01:14:53.454 --> 01:14:58.526
And each one of the encounters
in this book happened to me.

01:14:58.559 --> 01:15:00.962
I've changed the names
and a few details,

01:15:00.994 --> 01:15:04.097
but the stories, and feelings,

01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:05.834
are all based on fact.

01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:10.504
And each one has shaped me.

01:15:10.538 --> 01:15:12.540
And you want
to know something else?

01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:14.542
I've been
on tour for a few weeks,

01:15:14.574 --> 01:15:17.912
and during that time,
I've slept with

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:18.847
two more.

01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:51.847
Actually, make that three.

01:16:01.288 --> 01:16:02.222
Okay, four.

01:16:04.592 --> 01:16:08.396
My husband Theo and I have
been married now for ten years.

01:16:08.428 --> 01:16:10.364
Is he aware of my dalliances?

01:16:10.397 --> 01:16:12.400
Of course he is.

01:16:12.432 --> 01:16:14.368
In fact, he encourages them,

01:16:14.401 --> 01:16:17.070
because he wants me
to be fulfilled.

01:16:17.104 --> 01:16:19.374
But there is a caveat
to this arrangement,

01:16:19.406 --> 01:16:23.477
he insists that my flings
stay purely physical.

01:16:23.511 --> 01:16:26.614
He doesn't want me to be emotionally
involved with any of these women.

01:16:26.646 --> 01:16:28.949
But see,
I'm not sure that's possible.

01:16:33.486 --> 01:16:36.290
It's natural for me
to feel something

01:16:36.324 --> 01:16:39.060
for every woman I'm with.

01:16:39.092 --> 01:16:40.528
Sometimes I can walk away,

01:16:40.561 --> 01:16:42.931
enjoy some lingering
sensations over breakfast,

01:16:42.963 --> 01:16:44.899
and then think
nothing more of it.

01:16:46.499 --> 01:16:49.236
Other times,
I'm swept off my feet,

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:51.439
with a rush,
like a teenager's first love.

01:16:53.673 --> 01:16:55.644
Why am I sharing this now?

01:16:58.079 --> 01:17:01.182
From a marketing
perspective it's self-sabotage,

01:17:01.214 --> 01:17:02.984
I've ruined the mystique.

01:17:04.051 --> 01:17:05.186
You all know the truth.

01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:08.122
End of narrative.

01:17:08.154 --> 01:17:10.090
Maybe I've killed my sales.

01:17:11.225 --> 01:17:15.195
But if that's the price
of peace of mind, so be it.

01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:17.030
Anyway, thank you for listening,

01:17:17.064 --> 01:17:18.667
back to the frozen quiche.

01:19:10.311 --> 01:19:13.081
<i>Mon amour?</i>
Are you back on land?

01:19:13.114 --> 01:19:15.383
<i>Hey, honey!
Even better, I'm home.</i>

01:19:15.415 --> 01:19:17.284
What? Don't move!

01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:33.434
Hey! Baby.

01:19:33.467 --> 01:19:35.670
Look, I'm so sorry
for what happened.

01:20:52.413 --> 01:20:54.214
I'm aware that
most restaurants fail.

01:20:54.248 --> 01:20:56.584
I am, okay, I,

01:20:56.617 --> 01:20:58.285
I said to Rafael over there,
I said,

01:20:58.319 --> 01:21:00.454
"I must be fucking crazy

01:21:00.486 --> 01:21:02.422
to open yet another restaurant

01:21:02.455 --> 01:21:04.292
right in the heart of Paris."

01:21:04.324 --> 01:21:06.260
And he said to me, "Yes, Theo,

01:21:06.293 --> 01:21:07.662
you are crazy,

01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:10.964
but knowing you,
not even a straight jacket

01:21:10.998 --> 01:21:13.201
will hold you back.

01:21:13.234 --> 01:21:15.570
You'll be dicing onions with
a knife between your teeth."

01:21:15.602 --> 01:21:16.971
It's true!

01:21:17.003 --> 01:21:19.539
Regardless, as of tonight,

01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:22.610
we've officially survived
one year in business.

01:21:22.642 --> 01:21:23.877
- Woo!
- Thank you.

01:21:24.912 --> 01:21:26.480
And, hey, we must be doing
something right,

01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:28.348
because there
has not been a single

01:21:28.382 --> 01:21:29.717
case of food poisoning!

01:21:29.749 --> 01:21:31.819
I mean, wow.

01:21:32.886 --> 01:21:34.288
Now as many of you know,

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.323
I imagined this place

01:21:35.355 --> 01:21:36.890
as a cultural mecca.

01:21:36.923 --> 01:21:39.726
Jazz, readings and recitals.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.829
Granted it has taken
a while to get here, but...

01:21:42.863 --> 01:21:45.665
ladies and gentlemen
I'm honored to finally host

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:47.735
- <i>Savory Notes #1.</i>
- Woohoo!

01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:51.605
And I'm especially honored

01:21:51.638 --> 01:21:54.508
to introduce our first artist,
my beautiful wife.

01:21:55.441 --> 01:21:58.245
Or as you may know her,
Theo's beautiful wife.

01:22:00.713 --> 01:22:02.617
She'll read
from her story titled,

01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:04.318
<i>They Didn't Know it was Music.</i>

01:22:04.351 --> 01:22:05.720
Over to you baby.

01:22:08.655 --> 01:22:09.856
<i>Merci, mon amour.</i>

01:22:11.824 --> 01:22:13.427
<i>They Didn't Know it was Music.</i>

01:22:15.663 --> 01:22:17.330
<i>"Resfeber.</i>

01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:18.566
Swedish.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.436
The restless race
of the traveler's heart

01:22:22.468 --> 01:22:24.571
before the journey begins,

01:22:24.605 --> 01:22:27.775
when anxiety and anticipation
are entangled.

01:22:30.077 --> 01:22:31.245
Chapter one.

01:22:32.413 --> 01:22:34.382
As I packed my bags,

01:22:34.414 --> 01:22:37.350
my <i>resfeber</i> surged
at full-throttle,

01:22:37.383 --> 01:22:39.720
elevating the smallest decisions

01:22:39.753 --> 01:22:41.823
into epoch-making significance.

01:22:43.356 --> 01:22:46.327
The choice
between sneakers or flats

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.863
was lent gravity
usually reserved

01:22:48.895 --> 01:22:51.298
for matters
of national security,

01:22:51.332 --> 01:22:54.901
decisions deciding
the fate of civilization.

01:22:54.935 --> 01:22:57.872
It was the Cuban missile crisis
of comfortable footwear.

01:22:59.506 --> 01:23:01.842
My indecision was crippling.

01:23:01.874 --> 01:23:05.412
I needed a random determinant
to unlock my subconscious.

01:23:05.445 --> 01:23:06.480
So I flipped a coin.

01:23:07.448 --> 01:23:08.816
Heads.

01:23:08.848 --> 01:23:10.383
I'd take sneakers.

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:13.020
Damn it, I wanted flats.

01:23:13.052 --> 01:23:15.422
