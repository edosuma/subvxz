Spot:
The day started
like any other:

01:12.960 --> 01:17.620
a dog, a dame,
an old detective show.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.040
But it soon turned as ugly

01:19.040 --> 01:21.330
as a pitbull in pearls.

01:21.330 --> 01:23.620
My poodle!
My sister!

01:23.620 --> 01:25.290
My poodle!
My sister!

01:25.290 --> 01:27.500
Sorry, toots,
your little game's over.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.290
You're taking the fall.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.330
Man, that detective
sure is smart.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.710
I never would've figured
Natasha did it.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.750
Oh, give me a break.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.830
It was obvious
from the beginning.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.170
She used the old
hollow poodle trick.

01:41.170 --> 01:44.330
Oh, yeah, right,
like you knew.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.960
Are you kidding?

01:45.960 --> 01:49.540
Guilt was all over her face
like a DayGlo muzzle.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.080
A real detective always knows.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.460
Hello!

01:53.460 --> 01:54.920
Reality check!

01:55.960 --> 01:57.920
Detective, farm animal.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.290
Private eye, poultry.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.960
Their laughter mocked me
like a rubber sandwich.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.710
Sure, it was fun
to chew on,

02:08.710 --> 02:12.250
but it left me
feeling empty inside.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.960
Soon, they'd be howling
a different tune.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.120
You won't believe it!

02:23.120 --> 02:26.710
Cornelia's laid the biggest egg
in chicken history!

02:37.710 --> 02:41.670
Lucy, Corny's laid a giant egg
and we're gonna go see it!

02:41.670 --> 02:42.710
Come on!

02:42.710 --> 02:45.500
Oh, that's just
what this farm needs,

02:45.500 --> 02:48.460
a big egg
that'll make a big chick

02:48.460 --> 02:50.710
that'll make a big noise.

02:50.710 --> 02:54.500
Now I'll never get
any peace and quiet.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.460
You're not
a morning person,
are you?

03:04.290 --> 03:06.080
Cruella:
Think, Anita! Think!

03:06.080 --> 03:07.960
A new design,
something exciting,

03:07.960 --> 03:09.880
something thrilling!

03:09.880 --> 03:11.670
Something I can make
for peanuts.

03:11.670 --> 03:14.500
Well, I was thinking
about a new line

03:14.500 --> 03:17.040
of fashionable work wear
for farm folk.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.290
Out of the stable
and straight to the table.

03:20.290 --> 03:21.540
Ugh.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.250
Hm.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.830
Hm...

03:24.830 --> 03:28.380
Ugh. No, no, no, no!

03:28.380 --> 03:31.000
That's too done,
too ordinary!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.920
We need something
that's never before been seen.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.290
-Something... something...

03:37.290 --> 03:39.920
something... something...

03:39.920 --> 03:43.830
Oh, what is that
infernal farmy noise?

03:45.040 --> 03:47.120
Oh, dear. Something's
bothering the hens.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.420
I better go check.

03:48.420 --> 03:52.250
But you haven't given me
my brilliant idea yet!

03:55.830 --> 03:57.330
Whoa!

03:57.330 --> 03:58.960
That's big!

03:58.960 --> 04:00.960
That's huge!

04:00.960 --> 04:02.920
That's breakfast!

04:02.920 --> 04:04.880
"Breakfast"?

04:04.880 --> 04:09.420
Why, that egg is sure to
win a prize at the county fair.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.250
So it's a big egg.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.330
I am much bigger

04:19.330 --> 04:22.420
and gettin' bigger all the time.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.080
Interesting case.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.290
Egg envy.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.750
Oh my!

04:30.750 --> 04:33.120
Cornelia, you wonderful girl.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.170
Look at the size
of this egg!

04:35.170 --> 04:38.290
Anita, I don't have
time for this!

04:38.290 --> 04:41.710
I must have my new idea
for the House of de Vil.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.960
Something that will crack
the fashion world wide op--

04:46.250 --> 04:48.380
Mm...

04:48.380 --> 04:50.000
Yes.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.380
Yes. I sense inspiration.

04:53.380 --> 04:58.920
Crude, simple, smooth,
yet strangely oval.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.000
Oh.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.460
I've just had the most
eggs-ordinary idea!

05:04.460 --> 05:07.380
I'm brilliant.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.500
Whew.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.920
-Ah.
-Ta-ta, Anita darling.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.670
-Must dash.
-But Cruella--

05:17.670 --> 05:20.920
-I had a feeling
deep in my giblets

05:20.920 --> 05:23.620
that something devilish
was about to happen

05:23.620 --> 05:25.170
to that egg.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.170
My egg!

05:47.170 --> 05:49.460
My beautiful egg!

05:49.460 --> 05:51.290
Vanished!

05:51.290 --> 05:53.790
Try to keep
your sunny side up, Cornelia.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.790
Oops. Bad choice of words.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.710
I mean, who could have
poached this egg?

06:06.420 --> 06:08.170
Ugh. Did it again!

06:08.170 --> 06:11.790
Bad Cadpig!
Ooh, bad Cadpig!

06:11.790 --> 06:14.790
Boy, I sure wish
that TV detective was here.

06:14.790 --> 06:17.380
He could solve this mystery
in a minute.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.170
Detective?

06:21.170 --> 06:22.880
Hm...

06:22.880 --> 06:24.830
What's got into her?

06:24.830 --> 06:26.040
Bad worms?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.290
-Hey!

06:27.290 --> 06:28.790
Who turned off the color?

06:33.790 --> 06:34.790
Oh no!

06:34.790 --> 06:37.210
Farm noir! Huh?

06:40.710 --> 06:42.250
Puppies:
Spot?

06:42.250 --> 06:46.120
The name's Pullet Marlow,
private chick.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.710
Mystery is my middle name.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.170
I thought it was "Irma."

06:56.420 --> 06:58.710
It was a hot day
in the hen house.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.460
Crazy hot.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.500
Hot enough to make
a criminal stick
to his story.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.920
But first...

07:06.920 --> 07:10.580
-I had to find one to grill.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.670
What's up with you, poultry PI?

07:27.670 --> 07:29.620
I'll tell you what's up.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.710
I'm taking charge

07:30.710 --> 07:33.330
and I'm cracking
this egg-napping caper.

07:33.330 --> 07:36.670
Uh-oh, Spot's getting
delusional again.

07:36.670 --> 07:41.000
Let's hope this ends
better than that ugly
Swiss bell-ringing incident.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.420
Enough yapping.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.920
Who's with me
and who's a suspect?

07:47.170 --> 07:48.210
All:
We're with you.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.750
Good. Let's case the joint,

07:50.750 --> 07:53.080
heh, for prints.

07:58.750 --> 08:04.880
Spot:
Hm... hoof prints, goose prints,
puppy prints, and...

08:04.880 --> 08:06.580
chicken prints?

08:06.580 --> 08:08.380
And the feet
are still in 'em!

08:11.120 --> 08:13.420
Spot, this is a farm.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.290
Those footprints are all ours.

08:15.290 --> 08:16.960
Minor detail.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.580
Spot:
Ah-ha!

08:19.580 --> 08:22.120
Another clue:
a feather.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.620
Now there's something

08:23.620 --> 08:26.040
you don't find
in a hen house every day.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.580
Oh, wait, you do.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.670
-Not this kind of feather.

08:31.670 --> 08:34.080
Observe the size
of the quill,

08:34.080 --> 08:35.710
the length of the barbs.

08:35.710 --> 08:39.710
This is the primary
wing feather of a goose.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.290
Goose feather?

08:41.290 --> 08:44.080
Hey, remember what
Lucy said yesterday?

08:45.540 --> 08:47.830
Oh, that's just
what this farm needs,

08:47.830 --> 08:49.420
a big egg that'll make

08:49.420 --> 08:52.670
a big chick
that'll make a big noise.

08:52.670 --> 08:55.670
I'll never get
any peace and quiet.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.710
We had our first suspect:

08:58.710 --> 09:01.170
a disgruntled goose
with a dislike for decibels.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.880
A goose who never wanted
to see that egg hatch.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.790
So who else was acting
suspiciously yesterday?

09:08.790 --> 09:12.540
Well, I remember everyone
was excited about the egg.

09:12.540 --> 09:15.170
Everyone except for Dumpling.

09:15.170 --> 09:17.250
She was only interested
in eating.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.710
And, uh, that's
a bad thing, right?

09:20.710 --> 09:23.920
But Dumpling also said
something about the egg.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.330
Uh, what was it?

09:29.460 --> 09:32.040
Huh, so it's a big egg.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.750
Who cares?

09:33.750 --> 09:38.670
I'm much bigger
and gettin' bigger
all the time!

09:40.000 --> 09:42.670
That's, uh,
not much to go on.

09:42.670 --> 09:46.580
But Cruella sure made
a big deal about that big egg.

09:46.580 --> 09:51.710
I've just had the most
eggs-ordinary idea!

09:52.920 --> 09:55.830
I began to wonder
what sort of crazy scheme

09:55.830 --> 09:57.710
that Cruella dame
might be cooking up.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.790
Perhaps a dinner party

09:59.790 --> 10:02.040
with deviled egg
as the main course?

10:02.040 --> 10:05.040
Let's split up
and investigate our suspects.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.750
Spot:
Lucky and Rolly--
assigned Dumpling.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.120
Look, Rolly.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.710
In there,
in that sack.

10:19.710 --> 10:22.120
The size, the shape,
it's gotta be the egg.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.290
Or a really big,
dirty jellybean.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.710
Let's check it out.

10:26.710 --> 10:30.330
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get past Ed Pig and Dumpling?

10:31.670 --> 10:35.540
Cadpig's assignment: Lucy.

10:35.540 --> 10:39.500
That nest is big enough to hold
two of Cornelia's eggs.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.040
I gotta get a look inside!

10:43.580 --> 10:45.880
My assignment: Cruella.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.120
I know that sneaking
into Villa de Vil was risky,

10:49.120 --> 10:51.380
but I'm a private chick.

10:51.380 --> 10:55.250
And danger is my business.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.000
Hi-yah!

11:08.380 --> 11:10.380
Oops.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.670
Ugh!

11:37.380 --> 11:40.380
Aah! What the blue blazes?

11:40.380 --> 11:42.960
Oh, this can't be good!

11:42.960 --> 11:45.460
What do you think you're doin'?

11:45.460 --> 11:48.210
Um, go back
to sleep, Ed.

11:48.210 --> 11:50.420
You're having a--
a dream.

11:50.420 --> 11:56.040
If I'm dreamin', then hows come
I have to go back to sleep?

12:08.420 --> 12:10.120
Rolly:
Get out of my way!

12:10.120 --> 12:13.040
Hey, how come I have to
do all the digging?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.880
Because, Rolly,
I told you,

12:14.880 --> 12:17.330
ice cream grows underground.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.460
Oh, yeah, that's right!

12:25.250 --> 12:28.460
My goodness, honeybunch.

12:28.460 --> 12:32.500
You certainly are gettin' to be
one big ol' fat sack of lard.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.460
Oh, thank you!

12:35.460 --> 12:38.750
Am I the biggest thing
you ever did see?

12:38.750 --> 12:43.790
Yeah, you're a shoe-in to win
that Best Big Farm Thing Contest

12:43.790 --> 12:46.830
just like you do every year,
yes, you do.

12:51.710 --> 12:55.750
I dig 20 feet underground,
and this is my reward?

13:06.790 --> 13:08.290
We'd better follow her.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.790
She's gone!
Now is my chance.

13:38.790 --> 13:42.080
So this is where
Lucy's been hiding the--

13:42.080 --> 13:46.210
She broke
Cornelia's egg!

13:51.250 --> 13:55.750
Finally, I made it
into Cruella's house.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.080
Heh.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.210
The goosebumps
on the back of my neck

14:03.210 --> 14:06.040
told me somebody was
on my trail.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.210
Also, that nagging rash
hadn't cleared up.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.960
It was plain as
the beak on my face.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.540
Cruella was the egg-napper.

14:43.540 --> 14:46.250
I got it.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.330
Oh, wait.
No, I got it.

14:48.330 --> 14:50.330
No, I don't got it.
I got it!

14:50.330 --> 14:51.880
I don't know. Aah!

14:53.420 --> 14:56.210
I, uh, I meant to do that.

15:19.670 --> 15:21.040
No!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.670
Spot:
Rubber egg?

15:29.670 --> 15:33.250
So that must be where
rubber chickens come from.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.830
Oh, so that's where I left it.

15:37.830 --> 15:40.670
It's time for
my press conference to begin.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.040
The House of de Vil presents

15:44.040 --> 15:47.960
a new fashion concept
that will bring you out
of your shell:

15:47.960 --> 15:49.330
egg wear!

15:50.790 --> 15:53.040
-Man: Oh, that's wonderful!
-Tah-dah!

15:53.040 --> 15:54.380
Oh, it's wonderful!

15:54.380 --> 15:56.250
This is the first
in my new line

15:56.250 --> 15:59.080
of low cholesterol accessories
that will have the public,

15:59.080 --> 16:02.170
uh, scrambling
to the stores.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.620
So there I was.

16:03.620 --> 16:07.170
An egg on her head
and egg on my face.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.170
Yes, the yolk was on me.

16:09.170 --> 16:12.920
I knew they were bad puns,
but nothing mattered anymore.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.080
Well, that's it.
We lost Dumpling.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.710
No, she's gotta
be here somewhere.

16:19.710 --> 16:24.790
You don't just lose
300 pounds of rampaging bacon.

16:24.790 --> 16:26.670
Cadpig:
Come here! Everybody!

16:26.670 --> 16:28.290
I caught the egg-napper!

16:28.290 --> 16:31.000
I got the egg-napper!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.120
I'm innocent.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.080
Innocent, I tell you!

16:34.080 --> 16:35.380
Hm...

16:35.380 --> 16:38.250
Cornelia:
Oh, maybe we don't have
enough evidence!

16:38.250 --> 16:40.250
We shouldn't jump
to conclusions.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.080
Well, sure we should.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
Now look here, you and me
go back a long way, Lucy,

16:45.080 --> 16:47.170
so it does pain me
to say this,

16:47.170 --> 16:48.880
but you know the law.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.250
Break an egg,
go to jail.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.040
I tell you, I didn't--

16:53.040 --> 16:56.500
Ed: But seeings how
we're old friends and all,

16:56.500 --> 17:01.000
I'm just gonna banish you
from the farm for all eternity.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.290
Fine.

17:02.290 --> 17:05.500
If that's the way
you want to be, who cares?

17:05.500 --> 17:08.710
This place was always
too noisy anyway.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.000
Don't forget to write.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.080
Spot, you missed it.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.540
Cadpig got the goods on Lucy.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.120
She was the egg-napper all long.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.120
Lucy

17:20.120 --> 17:22.290
Evidence, my dear chicken.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.670
I found these
all over Lucy's nest.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.830
Hm...

17:25.830 --> 17:28.290
My finely tuned
detective instincts say

17:28.290 --> 17:31.670
there's something funny
about these shells.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.830
Huh. Mm-hmm. Hm...

17:35.040 --> 17:37.080
We need to reassemble the egg
to know for sure.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.710
Glue sticks.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.290
Spot:
Ah-ha!

17:44.290 --> 17:47.120
This was not Cornelia's egg.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.920
I still have a piece left.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.170
So, this means...

17:51.170 --> 17:53.830
Lucy's being framed.

17:53.830 --> 17:55.040
Who would do that?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.960
What about the other suspects?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.830
Cruella's out.
Her egg bounces

17:58.830 --> 18:00.330
as high as her mood swings.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.670
That still leaves
one suspect:

18:02.670 --> 18:04.170
Dumpling.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.290
Where were you the night
Cornelia's egg was stolen?

18:07.290 --> 18:10.210
Where's that egg-shaped
thingy that was in your sty?

18:13.080 --> 18:16.040
And what's that little piece
of fat in the pork and beans?

18:16.040 --> 18:17.170
What?

18:17.170 --> 18:18.880
I thought she might know.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.380
None of your business.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.460
What's it to ya,
who cares,

18:22.460 --> 18:24.170
and Uncle Leo.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.620
Ed:
Now what is
all this here fuss?

18:26.620 --> 18:29.580
My Dumpling is eating
to get ready

18:29.580 --> 18:32.960
for the Best Big Farm
Thing Contest next week.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.380
Ain't you, honeybunch?
Isn't that right?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.830
Ah-ha! That's it!

18:36.830 --> 18:40.170
You felt threatened
by mommy's grade-A double jumbo,

18:40.170 --> 18:41.920
and that's why you took it!

18:41.920 --> 18:44.790
I do not have to answer
any more questions,

18:44.790 --> 18:46.420
do I, Daddy?

18:46.420 --> 18:49.960
Not without counsel,
sugarplum.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.210
That's when I knew
that big pork chop
was guiltier

18:56.210 --> 18:59.120
than a raccoon
at a garbage can convention.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.420
It was time for a stakeout.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.000
-Shh!

19:27.670 --> 19:30.960
-We lost her.
-Not if we follow our noses.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.380
Come on!

19:33.960 --> 19:36.000
That pesky pullet is on to me.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.830
I better put you
in a safer place.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.580
Spot:
Not so fast, big pig.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.250
I got you red hoofed.

19:43.710 --> 19:44.750
Aah!

19:44.750 --> 19:46.500
Yeow!

19:53.000 --> 19:54.620
You were right.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.040
It was Dumpling.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.960
Spot:
All right, porker, squeal.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.920
I am the best big farm thing
in the tri-county area

20:01.920 --> 20:04.380
and I have got
the medals to prove it.

20:04.380 --> 20:08.750
No egg is gonna rain
on my parade.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.880
Sorry, toots,

20:09.880 --> 20:12.040
your little game is over,

20:12.040 --> 20:15.040
and you're taking the fall.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.620
I-- I-- I didn't
mean to, Daddy.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.540
I was just afraid
you wouldn't be proud

20:20.540 --> 20:24.000
of me anymore
if I didn't win the contest.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.830
I would have
given it back right after
the contest was over.

20:27.830 --> 20:29.830
Oh, mudpie,

20:29.830 --> 20:32.920
I've always been proud of you.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.960
You'll always be the biggest
farm thing in my heart.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.460
Oh, gee, Daddy!

20:39.460 --> 20:41.920
Now apologize to Cornelia.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.790
I am sorry.

20:43.790 --> 20:48.710
Cornelia, I, uh, trust
I still have your vote
in the next election.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.790
Hm.

20:50.790 --> 20:52.080
The case was closed.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.960
But I knew
it would never be over

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
until a travesty
of justice was righted.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.080
Cadpig:
Lucy, come on back!

21:01.080 --> 21:02.960
-Come on, Lucy!
-Come back!

21:02.960 --> 21:05.960
Am I not leaving
fast enough for you?

21:12.750 --> 21:17.540
As mayor, I officially reinstate
you to full citizenship

21:17.540 --> 21:19.790
in our fair community.

21:19.790 --> 21:24.250
I also must say that I'm sorry
for my hasty actions, Lucy,

21:24.250 --> 21:27.920
and I have forbid Dumpling
to participate

21:27.920 --> 21:31.580
in this year's Best Big
Farm Thing Contest.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.580
Welcome back, Lucy.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.500
-Well, for once, I must say

21:38.500 --> 21:40.790
I don't mind
this kind of noise.

21:40.790 --> 21:43.880
But at least try
to sing on key.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.380
Ain't she something?
You heard the lady!

21:46.380 --> 21:47.420
Find a key...

21:47.420 --> 21:49.920
Well, it was a tough case,

21:49.920 --> 21:52.670
but at last,
the scales of Lady Justice

21:52.670 --> 21:53.880
were tipped to, uh...

21:53.880 --> 21:56.790
The-- the lady's scales
tipped over and, uh--

21:56.790 --> 21:59.540
No. Uh, the tipsy lady
scaled the, uh--

21:59.540 --> 22:00.790
Cadpig:
Face it, Spot.

22:00.790 --> 22:03.120
You're metaphorically
challenged.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.380
Hey, this is my iris out.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.920
Get our own voice-over.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.790
You call this a voice

22:08.790 --> 22:10.380
I'm the star of this one!

22:10.380 --> 22:11.670
I'm calling my agent!

22:11.670 --> 22:13.080
Hello, Sandy?
