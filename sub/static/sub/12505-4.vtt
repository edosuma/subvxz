[Payson] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.408 --> 00:09.077
[Payson] I'll never be
the same gymnast I was.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.445
- Be an artistic gymnast.
- If that's your plan,

00:11.479 --> 00:12.746
then it's over for me.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.483
Could you arrange for a
private sports endowment group

00:15.516 --> 00:17.651
to fund Emily Kmetko's
scholarship?

00:17.685 --> 00:20.388
- I don't see why not.
- No one can ever know it's me.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.057
You used to have the hots for
Steve Tanner for some reason.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.592
And now you're
attracted to me?

00:24.625 --> 00:28.662
[Steve] I want everyone to know
I'm nuts about her.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.733
- Are you out of love with Dad?
- I still love your father.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.768
Does he still love you?

00:42.510 --> 00:46.147
- Hey. Morning, Tater Tot!
- Mom, get dressed!

00:46.180 --> 00:48.616
After France, I promised
Sasha I'd show him
how dedicated I was.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.519
And we will get you to
the gym exactly on time.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.555
But don't you want
to grab something
from the fridge?

00:54.588 --> 00:57.258
I don't know.
Is there anything in it?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.127
Why don't you
find out for yourself?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.464
Wow. Did we get a visit
from the grocery fairy?

01:03.497 --> 01:07.168
Way better. Yesterday, you got
your first scholarship check

01:07.201 --> 01:10.438
from Kippman Private Sports
Endowment Group, Inc.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.807
This is double what the
National Gymnastics Scholarship
was. That's crazy.

01:13.841 --> 01:17.345
No, what's crazy is that it took
this long for someone to realize

01:17.378 --> 01:19.680
what a great investment
Emily Kmetko is.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.783
Now, check in the freezer.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.785
Go on! Hurry!

01:27.655 --> 01:30.791
OK, open it! Open it,
open it! Come on.

01:36.264 --> 01:39.700
Oh, my God!
This is a custom leo.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.735
It must have cost
hundreds of dollars.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.604
Never mind
how much it cost.

01:43.637 --> 01:48.142
Honey, you've spent your
entire life training in leos
that came from the outlet mall,

01:48.176 --> 01:52.180
and it's high time that
you looked like the winner
you are, inside and out.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.183
You like it, don't you?

01:58.186 --> 02:01.589
I have never had
anything this nice.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.756
Thank you.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.163
[both laugh]

02:15.703 --> 02:18.672
We really need to talk
about you drinking on the job.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.807
Ha-ha. Very funny.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.110
Steve is donating his
special private label wine

02:23.143 --> 02:25.613
for the Rock Awards
Banquet tomorrow night.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.681
It must be pretty bad wine
if he has this much spare.

02:27.715 --> 02:31.219
No, it's actually delicious,
if I recall,

02:31.252 --> 02:33.454
and the only reason he's
even parting with a drop of it

02:33.487 --> 02:36.156
is to buy some votes for
president of the Parents' Board.

02:36.190 --> 02:40.594
Out of morbid curiosity, what
did you ever see in that guy?

02:40.628 --> 02:43.364
Well, he was very sweet.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.700
To me, at least.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.636
He went to church with me

02:48.669 --> 02:53.341
and respected my feelings
on premarital sex,

02:53.374 --> 02:55.676
and we both believe in
the sacredness of marriage.

02:55.709 --> 03:00.614
Ah, yes, that sacred
institution with a 50
percent divorce rate.

03:00.648 --> 03:04.685
It's a holy institution
created by God.

03:05.853 --> 03:09.790
- I don't believe in God.
- Right.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.893
You don't believe
in God or in marriage.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.728
Is there anything
you do believe in?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.767
Don't tell anyone,
but, um...

03:21.735 --> 03:23.637
...I believe in leprechauns.

03:30.744 --> 03:34.548
[* Breaking Laces:
God in Training]

03:34.582 --> 03:37.785
So I wonder what Sasha's
new training plan for you is?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.720
- Aren't you excited?
- Yeah, I can hardly wait

03:39.753 --> 03:41.655
to start my whole
career over again.

03:41.689 --> 03:46.294
So I guess you're not in
the mood to see my new trick.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.930
- I wanted to surprise you.
- I still like surprises.
Go for it.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.337
* I am a God in training

03:56.370 --> 04:00.708
* It's time to turn
this mother out *

04:02.009 --> 04:04.678
* She'll want my body

04:05.613 --> 04:08.215
* She'll want my body

04:08.248 --> 04:11.419
Becca, that was
a level-eight skill.
When did you learn that?

04:11.452 --> 04:14.422
While you were out with your
back. I didn't want you to
see it until it was perfect.

04:14.455 --> 04:18.326
Well, it almost was.
All you need is a little bit
more speed on that first whip.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.728
- Not that I'm nitpicking...
- No, that's OK.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.896
Almost perfect
is good enough for me.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.899
I just wanted
to learn it for fun.
I'll see you after practice.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.903
* It's kind of dizzying *

04:31.772 --> 04:34.608
I hope you realize how horrible
Lauren's going to be to me

04:34.642 --> 04:36.310
now that you and
her dad have gone public.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.579
You just have to be
bigger than that.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.748
Steve and I have decided we
can't get between you girls.

04:40.781 --> 04:45.519
This from the woman who held
Billy Rossmore down on the
playground in first grade

04:45.553 --> 04:49.390
- so I could pay him back
for giving me a wedgie.
- People evolve, Emily.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.893
So, what you're saying
is I should just let Lauren
bully me all she wants?

04:52.926 --> 04:56.497
Look, honey, the thing about
bullies is they only pick
on the people who cry.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.800
Whatever she throws at us
just slides right off.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.704
- Good morning, Lauren.
- What are you so happy about?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.807
- Tila Tequila marathon
at the trailer park?
- Don't I wish!

05:06.840 --> 05:11.011
- Cute hairdo!
- Whatever.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.548
See? I was the bigger person.
She just slid right off me.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.451
- Hey there, Emily!
- Hi.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.554
- [groans]
- So how's your daughter

05:20.588 --> 05:23.924
- adjusting to our being out?
- Uh! She'll get used to it.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.960
That's the spirit.
We just need to be patient

05:26.994 --> 05:29.329
and firm about
our decision to date,

05:29.363 --> 05:31.932
and I'm sure even
Lauren will come around.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.768
That is exactly
what I told Emily.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.707
Hey, you guys.
Would you like a cute barrette?

05:39.740 --> 05:44.412
I bought extras in Rock colors
and thought it would be so fun
if we all wore them.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.648
Here you go.
I always wanted a little sister.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.752
- What is that all about?
- She's campaigning
for The Rocky award.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.756
- It's the only award
the whole gym votes on.
- What's it for?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.626
- Congeniality.
- [laughing]

05:58.659 --> 05:59.893
Kaylie's won it
three years in a row.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.029
But since she's
getting Gymnast of the Year,

06:02.062 --> 06:04.498
Lauren probably thinks
she's got a shot.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.501
Well, I only got a shot
at Gymnast of the Year
because you were out.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.438
Payson's won it
five years in a row.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.740
That's not true, Kaylie. You
got it because you deserve it.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.042
Thanks, Pay.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.649
My adoring public,
so exhausting.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.485
- Good luck buying that
popularity award.
- Please.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.955
I'm just spreading the love,
unlike you girls in your
snooty little clique.

06:27.988 --> 06:28.989
[Kaylie] Right.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.994
- That's a custom leo.
- Yeah, I know.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.863
That's gorgeous, Emily.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.831
Those fabrics aren't
even available yet.

06:37.865 --> 06:41.669
I tried to get one last month.
How did you get it?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.771
I bought it.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.039
With money from the Kippman
Private Endowment Group.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.941
They're sponsoring me
as a gymnast.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.711
- [Payson] Wow, good
for you Emily.
- Thank you.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.380
Well, you look fantastic.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.983
Hey, maybe Emily will
win The Rocky this year.

06:58.519 --> 07:03.591
Payson. I'm happy to see
you've taken up my challenge

07:03.624 --> 07:05.493
to become an
artistic gymnast.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.728
I don't know what choice I have,
other than trying
to stop puberty.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.831
You grew an inch while you were
injured and your body changed.
That's all.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.834
And I can't be a power
gymnast anymore.
Which leaves the field

07:13.867 --> 07:15.836
of prancing around
for me to conquer.

07:15.869 --> 07:20.140
Look, I know you've
always defined yourself
as a power gymnast, Payson,

07:20.173 --> 07:23.410
but there are some artistic
and dance elements in gymnastics

07:23.443 --> 07:27.615
that can give you the same
point total as those power
moves you used to have.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.683
We're gonna change your
style of gymnastics,

07:29.717 --> 07:31.685
and in order to do that,
we're going to reinvent you

07:31.719 --> 07:34.187
- from the ground up.
- So where do we start?

07:34.221 --> 07:37.725
- Level eight and nine skills?
- Lower.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.794
- Six and seven?
- Look.

07:40.828 --> 07:44.732
In order to be great
at anything, you first
need to master the basics.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.701
What skill level
are we talking here?

07:51.739 --> 07:54.074
You can't be serious.
They're level ones!

07:54.107 --> 07:56.510
Meet your new teammates.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.975
[rock music plays]

08:28.008 --> 08:31.511
* I got a hitchhiker
in the trunk of my car *

08:31.545 --> 08:34.081
Hey! Did you bring
the Kaylie pictures?

08:34.114 --> 08:37.150
Surrender the disk.
Ronnie doesn't see why we
couldn't have downloaded

08:37.184 --> 08:40.554
- all 10,000 photos
of Kaylie for the banquet.
- Oh, please!

08:40.588 --> 08:44.224
You were just as bad.
You picked out ten photos
of her first somersault.

08:44.257 --> 08:47.027
The most documented move
in gymnastics history.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.262
Says the woman who photographed
every new outfit and haircut.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.931
Let's go take
a look at these.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.106
- So it looks like your
parents are back together?
- Yeah.

08:59.139 --> 09:03.811
I mean, my dad has not
moved back in yet, but
it's only a matter of time.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.616
Toes pointed, legs extended,
arms perfectly straight.

09:11.118 --> 09:16.857
Every one of your limbs
should feel like it's
six feet long. Like this.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.860
- It's a cartwheel.
- And it's one of the
basic moves in gymnastics.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.562
A perfect cartwheel can help
you learn a perfect round-off

09:22.596 --> 09:25.132
which will help you learn
a perfect walkover, etc., etc.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.534
I've been doing all the basics
perfectly since I was ten.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.170
You've done the basics
perfectly for a power gymnast.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.806
But as a more of an
artistic gymnast, the
standards have changed.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.143
It's no longer about height,
it's about lines.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.878
Do it again.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.751
* I'm going out of my mind
I'm doing time *

09:43.784 --> 09:47.220
* I'm going out of my mind

09:48.121 --> 09:49.289
I did it!

09:50.724 --> 09:52.225
- [Sasha] Payson.
- Yeah.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.995
* I'm going out of my mind

09:55.028 --> 09:57.765
* I'm doing time
I'm going out of my mind **

09:57.798 --> 09:59.667
That's better. Again.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.035
[techno music plays]

10:20.320 --> 10:23.323
Excellent, Emily!
Whatever happened in France

10:23.356 --> 10:25.693
has certainly motivated
you to up your game.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.060
And you're looking
like a winner

10:27.094 --> 10:30.030
from the inside out
in that dazzling new leo.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.333
Thank you. It's just,
my mom bought it for me.

10:33.366 --> 10:37.404
You deserve it.
It's good to see you acting
and dressing like a champion.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.847
- [Lauren] Hey, ya'll.
- Good job.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.917
Everyone worked so hard today,
I thought we deserved
a little treat.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.619
The Spruce Juice truck
is in the parking lot

10:52.652 --> 10:56.056
serving refreshing smoothies,
on me. Come on, let's go.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.626
- Before the next rotation.
- [indistinct chattering]

10:59.659 --> 11:01.261
Well, I don't
know about "ya'll,"

11:01.294 --> 11:03.931
but I'm always down
for a free smoothie,
no matter who's buyin'.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.099
You in?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.035
You don't think
she's poisoned them?

11:10.938 --> 11:11.939
[all] Nah.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.978
I don't know why you care
about being the most
popular gymnast at The Rock.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.215
You know, the greatest
obstacle to success is caring
what other people think.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.117
How do you think
I got where I am?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.119
I don't care what
people think of me.

11:26.153 --> 11:29.156
I just can't let Kaylie
win again this year.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.358
If her head gets any bigger,
she'll be insufferable.

11:31.391 --> 11:35.362
OK, but quid pro quo.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.766
I'll contribute to your campaign
if you agree to have ice cream

11:38.799 --> 11:41.701
with Emily and her mother
after the awards Banquet.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.138
Fine. But you're my dad and
you're my date to the banquet,

11:45.172 --> 11:47.808
and I'm not sharing you
with Chloe or Emily.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.812
And we're not
sitting with them.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.449
- Emily's new leo is so awesome.
- And she's so nice.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.819
I bet she wins
The Rocky this year.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.189
One per person, and when
we reach $200, cut 'em off.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.794
Ah... he's making you
new ones, guys.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.399
Hey, ya'll. Can I offer
you guys a smoothie?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.234
Kaylie, Payson?

12:15.102 --> 12:18.171
- Emily?
- [gasps]

12:18.205 --> 12:19.873
[all gasp] Oh!

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
Oops. I'm so sorry.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.850
[sighs]

12:40.127 --> 12:44.197
So... highlights
and low lights of the day.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.766
- I got nothin' but low lights.
- I have a highlight.

12:46.800 --> 12:51.404
Sasha says I'm ready to
start seriously training
to be an elite if I want to.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.074
That's a really big deal, honey.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.143
I had no idea you even
wanted to go elite.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.210
I never thought
I was good enough.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.246
But Sasha says I'm
peaking all of a sudden.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.916
Wow. Well, yay you!

13:02.950 --> 13:05.552
- That's great news,
isn't it, Payson?
- Yeah, it is.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.091
I think this calls for
a special celebration treat.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.127
- Who's in for a fro' yo run?
- Me.

13:14.161 --> 13:18.465
I'd love to, but I had no idea
that doing 200 cartwheels in
one day could be so exhausting.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.800
I think I'm just
gonna go to bed.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.139
I'm really
proud of you, Becca.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.875
Thanks.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.054
Good morning, Lauren.

13:41.088 --> 13:45.158
How about you spare me
your suck-up comments
about my great hair,

13:45.192 --> 13:48.128
because considering
the source, I'm not
sure it's a compliment.

13:48.161 --> 13:54.001
Well, then, perhaps you'd like
to hear my comments on what a
selfish little monster you are!

13:54.034 --> 13:57.104
Did I just hear you call
my daughter a monster?

13:57.137 --> 13:59.506
She purposefully
dumped a berry smoothie

13:59.539 --> 14:03.476
all over Emily's brand-new
$300 leo and ruined it!

14:03.510 --> 14:06.213
- You spent $300?
- It was an accident.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.081
Honey, if you can balance
on a four-inch beam,

14:08.115 --> 14:11.118
don't tell me you can't
balance a 24-ounce beverage.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.922
All right! Why don't you
girls get into practice
and we'll iron this out.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.324
Fine, but you
better let her have it!

14:17.357 --> 14:20.593
- Are you kidding me?
- What's going on with you?

14:20.627 --> 14:23.030
I'm sorry, Steve,

14:23.063 --> 14:26.066
but your daughter's Blonde
Ambition tour is getting
a little out of control.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.001
I thought we weren't
gonna get involved.

14:28.035 --> 14:31.204
Really? Is that why
you're helping her
buy The Rocky award?

14:31.238 --> 14:35.042
She's not trying to buy
the award, she's just...
lobbying a little.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.078
She'd have a better chance
of lobbying for a single-payer
health care plan

14:38.111 --> 14:39.947
than a
congeniality award.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.049
Well, your daughter
is not exactly

14:42.082 --> 14:45.552
- Miss Popularity herself.
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:45.585 --> 14:49.957
Just that Lauren's
a bit more gregarious.
Emily sort of keeps to herself.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.226
Which some girls might interpret
as being a bit stuck-up.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.429
Not exactly the personality
type that wins The Rocky.

14:56.463 --> 15:01.268
Really?
Well, we will see about that!

15:02.102 --> 15:04.404
[rock music plays]

15:10.077 --> 15:12.112
[sighs]

15:17.150 --> 15:19.219
Kaylie, what are
you doing?

15:19.252 --> 15:22.389
Genji Cho is the only girl
in the world right now who can
do a round-off Arabian mount,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.091
and I am
going to be the second.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.093
I want to nail
every move she has,

15:26.126 --> 15:29.662
and by 2012 I'll
have them, only better.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.564
Kaylie, stop.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.669
Your time's better spent
working on a full
twisting Tchatchov.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.072
- It's only a half-tenth
of a point less.
- I can do

15:39.106 --> 15:42.542
- the round-off Arabian.
- Kaylie, Genji will always have
a huge advantage over you

15:42.575 --> 15:45.045
with this move. It favors
the really tiny girls.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.447
Genji is at least ten pounds
lighter than you.

15:55.155 --> 15:59.226
I've been thinking,
since I am running for
president of the Parents' Board,

15:59.259 --> 16:03.096
having the most popular kid
at the gym is not a bad idea.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.497
If we could both win...

16:04.531 --> 16:08.568
We could rule the old Rock
together. Just me and you, kid.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.404
[rock music plays]

16:14.607 --> 16:20.013
[clears throat]
Uh, excuse me, everyone.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.514
Some attention, please.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.319
I said, I need
some attention, please!

16:29.222 --> 16:32.192
After practice,
compliments of me,

16:32.225 --> 16:37.197
- there will be a
massage station outside.
- [all clamoring]

16:37.230 --> 16:41.201
Just a little token of TLC,
because you all work so hard.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.206
And Emily Kmetko,

16:46.239 --> 16:49.242
friend to all,
enemy to none,

16:49.276 --> 16:54.114
perhaps a little shy
but not at all stuck-up, um,

16:54.147 --> 16:58.751
will also be sponsoring
a gift outside:

16:58.785 --> 17:03.090
Free mani and pedi
and waxing all afternoon!

17:03.123 --> 17:05.158
[cheering]

17:05.192 --> 17:09.429
So, when thinking about
The Rocky trophy this year,

17:09.462 --> 17:15.102
pick a color and pick
a friend, Emily Kmetko!

17:15.135 --> 17:18.037
[cheering]

17:22.775 --> 17:25.078
Free waxing today,
courtesy of Emily Kmetko!

17:25.112 --> 17:28.081
- Can I get my legs waxed, Mom?
- No!

17:28.115 --> 17:30.483
How about I just zip that
hair above her lip off?

17:30.517 --> 17:33.052
It'll just sting
for a second.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.256
- I mean...
- Mom, are you
really gonna do this?

17:36.289 --> 17:41.261
I'm not doing it for me,
I'm doing it for you,
to help you win The Rocky.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.197
Mom, I haven't even been
at this gym a year.
I'm not gonna win The Rocky.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.400
Well, who says? You're the
number two girl at The Rock.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.203
Steve seems to think that
lobbying is fair play.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.207
I think if we give he
and Lauren a run for their
money, you can win for sure.

17:54.241 --> 17:57.110
Is this about my winning
or you putting your
boyfriend in his place?

17:57.144 --> 17:59.346
You guys have a tent, right?
You can set it up right here.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.482
No, no, no. Shoo.
I was here first.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.755
Please. As if anyone
is wants to stick their feet
in your dirty water bowl,

18:08.788 --> 18:13.293
and... "Candy Cane Pink" went
out with your baby oil tan

18:13.326 --> 18:16.095
and... [sniffs]
Blue Jeans perfume.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.132
Did I call you a monster?
What I meant to call you
is a B-I-T-C...

18:19.166 --> 18:21.534
- Mom!
- Lauren, Emily, why
don't you go back in the gym?

18:21.568 --> 18:24.837
I'll handle this.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.606
Summer,
I was here first.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.209
Chloe, you are a grown
woman and a mother.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.512
- Lauren is a 16-year-old girl.
- And a bully!

18:32.545 --> 18:36.216
- You, of all people,
know how she can be!
- I do!

18:36.249 --> 18:41.721
But I also know that what
she really needs are some
examples of solid parenting.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.158
Look, Steve loves Lauren,

18:45.192 --> 18:48.328
but it's really hard
for him to say no to her.

18:48.361 --> 18:52.131
- Since his first
wife left him...
- For drugs.

18:52.165 --> 18:56.469
Yes. Since then, Steve and
Lauren have band together

18:56.503 --> 18:59.306
to become this little team
of winners, you know?

18:59.339 --> 19:04.877
They don't want
to get left behind again.
And they can get carried away.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.714
I just think that
what Lauren needs

19:07.747 --> 19:10.750
isn't someone to
put her in her place,

19:10.783 --> 19:14.153
but to understand her.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.690
And if you're gonna be
the woman in Steve's life,

19:17.724 --> 19:19.926
then that might
just have to be you.

19:27.634 --> 19:31.304
[electronic dance music plays]

19:36.175 --> 19:40.213
Hey, champ. That's a lot
of conditioning on top
of a practice day.

19:40.247 --> 19:44.251
Um, I'm trying to get my
round-off Arabian mount,

19:44.284 --> 19:47.754
and I need to be more,
uh, aerodynamic.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.757
That's my girl.
Ah. Look at this.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.660
Your mom and I are so
proud of you, sweetheart.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.862
Huh! Thanks, Dad.

19:59.332 --> 20:03.303
Uh, it means...

20:03.336 --> 20:07.206
...so much to me that
we're finally back together
as a family.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.777
And you and Mom
seem to be doing really well.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.913
We always do well when we
roll our sleeves up for you.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.449
And how about, um,
you and me?

20:17.817 --> 20:22.555
- What do you mean?
- Well...

20:22.589 --> 20:25.492
...I feel like this mess was...

20:25.525 --> 20:27.427
...partly my fault.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.397
You and I worked so much
on my gymnastics that

20:30.430 --> 20:34.233
there really wasn't
much room for Mom.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.270
And maybe that's why she
got involved with my coach.

20:37.304 --> 20:41.541
Kaylie, none of that
is your fault.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.444
But I knew about it,
and I didn't tell you.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.514
Sweetheart, we're
past all that.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.782
And I never blamed you.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.919
- So, we're OK?
- Of course we're OK.
We're great.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.821
We're all great.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.690
Good.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.759
Thank you.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.261
[Summer] Hey,
everything looks so nice.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.397
It's going to be great.

21:04.431 --> 21:08.267
Listen, I just thought
you and I could alternate
on the mic tonight.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.970
We? Isn't Sasha MC'ing?

21:11.003 --> 21:14.807
No, the gym managers
host the banquet.
It's The Rock tradition.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.379
I have to get up
in front of the whole room?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.683
I... I can't.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.919
I thought you were used to
speaking at your church.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.288
Not unprepared.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.291
I rehearse for weeks and weeks
to get over my stage fright.

21:32.325 --> 21:36.529
- I can't improvise.
- Tanner wine.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.633
It's good.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.339
Come on, Summer.
You'll do fine.

Here's a raffle ticket to win
a case of my personal wine.

22:03.723 --> 22:08.361
And don't forget I'm running for
president of the Parents' Board.

22:08.395 --> 22:11.964
If it isn't the most
beautiful mother-daughter
duo here tonight.

22:11.998 --> 22:16.335
- And the most popular.
- I'm gonna go find our table.

22:16.369 --> 22:20.306
OK. So, um, how's
the campaigning going?

22:20.339 --> 22:22.975
Tough. It's always
an insanely political race.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.944
- So why do you do it?
- For Lauren.

22:24.977 --> 22:28.481
I believe it's really
important that the girls
have a strong parent

22:28.515 --> 22:30.049
looking after
their interests.

22:30.082 --> 22:33.953
But sometimes I get
carried away.

22:33.986 --> 22:38.958
I'm sorry I got
defensive about Lauren.

22:38.991 --> 22:42.328
Well, I think we both
got a little defensive.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.432
- When you love
your kid so much...
- It's hard to be objective.

22:45.465 --> 22:49.368
But we can't let that
get between us. So,
no matter who wins tonight...

22:49.402 --> 22:52.071
- Even if it's Emily?
- Or Lauren.

22:52.104 --> 22:55.408
- ...we're neutral. Agreed?
- Agreed.

22:55.442 --> 22:58.010
See you in there.
I got us all a great table.

22:58.044 --> 23:02.114
If anyone still hasn't
voted for The Rocky Award,
it's not too late.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.586
Hey, Summer.
Oh, great dress.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.121

23:09.155 --> 23:12.892
how absolutely,
exquisitely,

23:12.925 --> 23:16.062
incredibly lovely
you look tonight, Kaylie!

23:16.095 --> 23:19.065
Well, thank you.

23:19.098 --> 23:23.536
If it isn't the proud parents
of the Gymnast of the Year.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.938
Who would have thought
when we all founded
The Rock that our daughter

23:25.972 --> 23:29.709
would be National Champion
and Gymnast of the Year
and your daughter would be...

23:29.742 --> 23:32.945
Well, I'm sure she'll win
something, someday. Excuse us.

23:41.888 --> 23:45.157
Well, speaking of awards.
I better start counting
these suckers.

23:45.191 --> 23:49.629
Oh! Oh, shoot!

23:49.662 --> 23:53.432
- How much of this have you had?
- Oh, just a few sips.

23:53.466 --> 23:57.637
- I... You know me.
- As I recall,
you're a lightweight.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.640
I don't think I've ever seen you
drink more than a few sips.

24:00.673 --> 24:05.545
I'm just nervous about
MC'ing tonight, and now
I just stained my dress.

24:05.578 --> 24:10.082
Why don't you run to the
ladies room and I'll take
this to the office for you.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.853
- Oh, OK. Thanks.
- No worries.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.045
- Hello, everyone,
and good evening. Whoo!

for Sasha the Great Belov!

* You train us
through our pain *

* What would we do
without you? *

25:47.046 --> 25:51.250
- * You believe in us
- * And make us tough

Heck, we even
kicked China's butts!

- Thank you. Thank you so much.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.852
Wasn't that sweet?

26:25.885 --> 26:30.022
It's so moving to see girls
who really love their coach.

26:30.056 --> 26:34.694
- Thank you.
- And he is a lovable man.

26:34.727 --> 26:39.866
- Coach. What a
great coach, huh? Um...
- [applause]

26:39.899 --> 26:44.971
- You're doing just fine.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
my co-host, Kim Keeler!

- Hi, everybody.

Well, you all look great.
If we had a dollar for every
pair of Spanx we have in here,

26:53.145 --> 26:56.983
- we wouldn't have to hold
any more fundraisers.
- [Summer laughs loudly]

26:57.016 --> 27:00.086
- [laughing]
- OK, then.

27:00.119 --> 27:05.324
So now, uh, it is time
for our great Rock tradition,

27:05.357 --> 27:07.293
The Rock Team Roll Call.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.962
So could we have all the
presenting parents come on up?

27:09.996 --> 27:12.131
- [applause]
- Come on up.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.136
When Kaylie was four and
in the Tumbling Tots program,

27:17.169 --> 27:20.272
she was so shy that
she would hide behind my legs

27:20.306 --> 27:23.943
- and make me stand next
to her the entire time.
- [chuckles]

27:23.976 --> 27:26.979
Then, one day, she just
took off. My little girl,
at four years old,

27:27.013 --> 27:30.649
had discovered something
far greater than her own fears.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.786
She had discovered
her love for gymnastics.

27:33.820 --> 27:38.157
And it's been a great ride
for us as a family.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.127
- Congratulations.
- [applause]

27:44.797 --> 27:47.133
Lauren is one of a kind.

27:47.166 --> 27:51.170
It is her drive
and determination

27:51.203 --> 27:54.941
to be the best
which inspires me

27:54.974 --> 27:57.777
to give back
to The Rock community.

27:57.810 --> 28:01.013
That's a quality she
and I share. Right, honey?

28:01.047 --> 28:05.317
And that is why I'd like
to take this opportunity
to be your leader.

28:05.351 --> 28:09.088
As we all know,
the Board will be electing
a new president soon,

28:09.121 --> 28:13.726
and I can't think of a
more qualified, dedicated person

28:13.760 --> 28:16.262
than myself for this position.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.298
The Olympics are
only two years away,
and I promise

28:19.331 --> 28:23.936
that with me as your president,
we can all take home the gold.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.072
Thank you.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.175
To my lovely daughter, Lauren.
I love you, sweetheart.

28:29.208 --> 28:34.747
- [applause]
- Hi. Emily?

28:34.781 --> 28:39.919
Um, "E" is for everything
that you always give to others.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.989
"M" is for magnificent.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.192
"I" is for intelligence
beyond your years.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.195
"L" is for the love of my life.

28:49.228 --> 28:53.699
And "Y" is for, "You're gonna
bring home the gold in 2012!"

28:53.732 --> 28:56.235
"Y" is for,
"You can kill me now."

28:56.268 --> 28:58.470
[applause]

28:58.504 --> 29:00.873
Um... Excuse me.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.842
Hi, it's me again. I just...

29:02.875 --> 29:07.379
I have something else
I wanted to say about
Lauren Tanner, actually.

29:07.413 --> 29:12.084
Um, she's a
very passionate girl.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.954
And ambitious. Very ambitious.

29:14.987 --> 29:19.158
Um, and when she sees something
she really wants,

29:19.191 --> 29:23.162
she really... she goes
after it full-force.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.866
And we cannot argue
that she is a very

29:26.899 --> 29:29.802
good-looking girl
with great hair.

29:29.836 --> 29:33.039
Um, I... I just
think that Lauren

29:33.072 --> 29:37.243
is very talented
and has a lot to offer.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.246
- Thank you, Lauren.
- [applause]

29:44.851 --> 29:46.986
That was lovely, parents.

29:47.019 --> 29:51.223
Now, it's time to announce
the winner of our Rocky Award.

29:51.257 --> 29:55.361
And as we all know,
this is a very important award

29:55.394 --> 30:00.766
because to have the respect
of your teammates, in any sport,

30:00.799 --> 30:04.236
- is a true honor.
- And The Rocky goes to...

30:10.209 --> 30:13.245
- ...Lauren Tanner!
- [scattered applause]

30:15.882 --> 30:18.150
Go on, honey! You won!

30:26.225 --> 30:29.161
Oh, my God. I won.
I actually won.

30:29.195 --> 30:33.032
I am the most popular girl
at The Rock.

30:33.065 --> 30:36.869
- OK. Uh...
- [feedback]

30:38.470 --> 30:40.873
OK, wow. Um...

30:40.907 --> 30:45.311
I really... I just
don't know what to say. Um...

30:45.344 --> 30:47.179
I've never doubted,
for one second,

30:47.213 --> 30:49.148
what my presence
has meant to all of...

30:49.181 --> 30:51.951
Each of you has counted
on me for help...

30:51.984 --> 30:55.421
It's just so wonderful...
...and guidance and support...

30:55.454 --> 30:57.189
It's so wonderful to be
acknowledged by all of you...

30:57.223 --> 30:59.858
I promise to continue
to be your friend,

30:59.892 --> 31:03.930
your mentor,
your leader, your...

31:03.963 --> 31:07.299
- [applause]
- [whistles]

31:09.235 --> 31:11.137
[Sasha] I am very
pleased to announce

31:11.170 --> 31:14.073
the award for Most Promising
Junior this year

31:14.106 --> 31:15.274
goes to Becca Keeler.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.910
- [screaming]
- Oh, my God, it's me!

31:24.216 --> 31:25.584
Whoo!

31:33.492 --> 31:36.595
It looks like dessert
is being served,
so let's take a few moments

31:36.628 --> 31:41.500
before enjoying the
presentation for the Gymnast of
The Year tribute to Kaylie Cruz.

31:41.533 --> 31:45.404
- [applause]
- Can you guys believe that?
I won!

32:08.927 --> 32:10.229
Hey. There you are.

32:13.099 --> 32:16.368
I don't know
what's wrong with me,

32:16.402 --> 32:18.670
why I feel so angry
all the time.

32:18.704 --> 32:22.474
There is nothing wrong
with you, Payson.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.543
What you're feeling...

32:25.978 --> 32:28.114
- ...it's very normal.
- No, it's not.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.050
I'm so mad at Kaylie for
being Gymnast of the Year,

32:31.083 --> 32:33.619
I'm mad at my own sister
for passing me by.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.089
And...
And I'm scared.

32:38.324 --> 32:42.028
I don't feel connected
to gymnastics anymore.

32:42.061 --> 32:46.265
I don't feel like I love
gymnastics like I used to.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.374
Did you only love this sport
because you were great?

32:58.144 --> 33:01.213
I guess it's easier
to love something
when you're good at it.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.282
Yeah, I agree.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.684
But where does
the passion come from?

33:07.086 --> 33:09.755
Is it from where you are
or where you want to be?

33:12.124 --> 33:14.526
Where you want to be,
I guess.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.631
I will continue
to hold the place for
your greatness, Payson,

33:19.665 --> 33:24.070
even if you can't right now.
I will believe it for you.

33:24.103 --> 33:27.506
Because you are
a champion, Payson Keeler.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.709
All I need from you right now,
the only thing I need,

33:30.742 --> 33:32.311
is for you to show up.

33:32.344 --> 33:36.582
So can you do that?
Can you keep showing up?

33:37.749 --> 33:42.588
- Yes. I can.
- Then we'll get there together.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.172
I will be right back, honey.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.703
Excuse me. If everyone
could kindly take their seats.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.309
This is so exciting!

34:42.481 --> 34:47.653
[Sasha] Kaylie Cruz is a
delightful young woman,

34:47.686 --> 34:49.355
and an
extraordinary gymnast.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.690
Not only is Kaylie
the National Champion,

34:51.723 --> 34:54.193
but she is also the only
American contender

34:54.226 --> 34:56.795
to ever beat
China's Genji Cho.

34:56.828 --> 35:01.200
Kaylie is a gifted natural
gymnast and a very hard worker.

35:01.233 --> 35:05.271
And that is why I am confident
Kaylie could very possibly
continue her reign

35:05.304 --> 35:09.175
when she beats Genji Cho
at the Olympics in 2012.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.711
So, it is with great pleasure
that I present to you,

35:12.744 --> 35:16.282
Miss Kaylie Cruz,
Gymnast of the Year.

35:16.315 --> 35:19.451
- [applause]
- [cheering]

35:43.275 --> 35:46.212
Thank you. [clears throat]

35:47.679 --> 35:52.184
Um, my dad told a story earlier

35:52.218 --> 35:56.121
about how I found my love
for gymnastics

35:56.154 --> 35:59.325
and overcame my fears.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.761
But see, the truth is

36:02.794 --> 36:05.864
that I overcame my fears

36:05.897 --> 36:10.502
because I knew that he would
always be standing there,

36:10.536 --> 36:12.704
to catch me if I fell.

36:12.738 --> 36:18.310
And it was my mom who,
for countless nights,

36:18.344 --> 36:22.881
iced my shin splints and
told me to reach for the moon

36:22.914 --> 36:27.319
because the worst
that could happen
is I would land on a star.

36:29.355 --> 36:32.157
Don't you see
that it's because of you,

36:32.190 --> 36:35.827
because of both of you,
that I am who I am?

36:35.861 --> 36:39.565
I could never have done
any of this without you guys.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.533
Both of you together.

36:41.567 --> 36:45.771
You taught me to never give up
on what's really important.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.706
And I never will.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.278
- Thank you.
- [applause]

37:11.997 --> 37:16.335
[Sasha] Excuse me, everyone,
sorry. There is actually one
more award yet to be presented.

37:16.368 --> 37:20.205
This is the first time
this award has ever been
given in The Rock community.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.976
It's The Championship Cup,
and it will be known by the
name of its first recipient.

37:25.010 --> 37:28.447
So I am very proud to announce
to you The Payson Keeler Award.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.717
[cheering]

37:34.720 --> 37:37.423
This award will be given
to the athlete

37:37.456 --> 37:39.725
who best embodies
the championship spirit.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.935
You know what Payson Keeler
has? A championship mentality.

37:49.968 --> 37:53.505
No matter what
the circumstances,
no matter what is going on,

37:53.539 --> 37:55.273
she's the kind of athlete

37:55.307 --> 37:56.975
that can find a way
to stay in the game,

37:57.008 --> 37:59.010
can find a way to win.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.246
Payson Keeler
is a true champion.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.816
People don't understand how
important the mental game
is to gymnastics.

38:04.850 --> 38:07.919
Your body, your training,
of course that's all important.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.722
But not as important as having
the mind of a winner.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.992
We've been watching the experts
talk like they're
counting Payson out.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.261
And we just laugh at
each other and say,

38:16.294 --> 38:18.364
"They don't know
Payson Keeler."

38:18.397 --> 38:22.868
I watched Payson win the Junior
National Championship
with an ACL injury.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.372
And I thought,
"Thank God she's not in
the Senior Elite category,

38:26.405 --> 38:30.041
- or I'd be worried."
- Payson isn't satisfied
with just doing her best.

38:30.075 --> 38:33.044
She makes sure we
all do our best, too.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.980
I know sometimes we fight,

38:35.013 --> 38:37.483
but I've never told you
that you're my best friend.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.486
I feel like the luckiest
person in the world
to have you as a sister

38:40.519 --> 38:43.021
because you're
everything I want to be.

38:43.054 --> 38:47.959
Every time I have a problem
with my gymnastics, I just
think, "What would Payson do?"

38:47.993 --> 38:50.295
As long as she
keeps showing up,

38:50.328 --> 38:51.963
Payson Keeler
will keep winning.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.500
And that's the heart
of a champion.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.335
[applause]

39:01.740 --> 39:04.576
So it is with great pleasure
that I present to you

39:04.610 --> 39:08.313
the first recipient of the
Payson Keeler Championship Cup,

39:08.346 --> 39:11.950
- Miss Payson Keeler.
- [applause]

39:27.966 --> 39:29.968
- Payson!
- Whoo!

39:30.001 --> 39:32.738
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

40:01.166 --> 40:06.071
This calls for a par-tay.
I say we stay up late
and watch White Nights.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.040
- You guys love that movie.
- We do not love that movie.

40:09.074 --> 40:12.077
- No.
- You have the hots
for Mikhail Baryshnikov.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.045
- Yes.
- A little.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.714
How about
Save the Last Dance?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.916
Can't. I'm getting up early
to go to the gym.

40:17.949 --> 40:21.920
- But tomorrow is Sunday, Pay.
- Yeah. I know.

40:24.523 --> 40:25.924
Wow.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.028
So that's it?
You're just giving up?

40:30.061 --> 40:33.532
- We tried.
Our marriage is just...
- Broken.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.867
We are always gonna
be here for you.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.937
- That is never gonna change.
- We are so proud of you.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.972
Our National Champ,
Gymnast Of The Year.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.841
- I don't want that thing.
- Kaylie.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.977
I'm the US National Champion
because of years

40:46.011 --> 40:49.848
of hard work that we all
put in together, as a family.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.050
That's how this has worked.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.586
That award?
My National Championship?

40:54.620 --> 40:57.556
It means nothing to me
if it costs me my family.

40:57.589 --> 41:01.026
- Sweetie, this divorce
has nothing to do with you.
- I am your daughter!

41:01.059 --> 41:05.931
Your decision to end
your marriage should have
everything to do with me!

41:05.964 --> 41:10.101
- That's not what we meant.
- Look, you say
your marriage is broken.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.137
But I've watched
you guys this past week,

41:12.170 --> 41:14.506
working on the
banquet together,

41:14.540 --> 41:16.842
dealing with the
press together.

41:16.875 --> 41:21.479
You were in synch, and happy.
I saw it. I felt it.

41:21.513 --> 41:26.852
And I know if you just gave it
more time, you'll feel it, too.

41:26.885 --> 41:32.057
- Kaylie, no.
- Six months. Just
wait six more months.

41:32.090 --> 41:36.562
And, I mean, it's not that long,
if you think about it.

41:36.595 --> 41:40.899
Kaylie, honey,
we are going to file...

41:40.932 --> 41:43.869
Just wait six months!

41:45.503 --> 41:48.840
Mom... Dad...

41:50.676 --> 41:51.910
Please?

41:51.943 --> 41:55.046
[* Gina Kaz: Water and Wine]

41:55.080 --> 41:59.551
All right.
Six more months.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.788
Really?

42:05.256 --> 42:06.892
Six months.

42:11.062 --> 42:14.099
[sobbing]

42:14.132 --> 42:17.502
* Let's play like
we were kids *

42:17.535 --> 42:19.237
[Kaylie] Thank you.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.710
[Summer] I don't feel so good.

42:24.743 --> 42:29.748
Just make sure you have
something to eat and drink
as much water as you can.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.651
I feel really,
really silly.

42:32.684 --> 42:38.123
[laughing] I haven't gotten
this tipsy since my
college graduation.

42:38.156 --> 42:40.892
- Whoopsies!
- Oh! You OK?

42:40.926 --> 42:43.094
Yeah.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.898
So this is where you live?
It's nice.

42:46.932 --> 42:50.001
It's very, uh, homey.

42:51.970 --> 42:55.874
You, too, could live in a
beautiful, homey house someday.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.009
Except you never
want to get married.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.145
Who said I never
want to get married?

43:00.178 --> 43:02.814
Uh, I thought you did.

43:02.848 --> 43:06.017
I think it would
be great to be married.

43:06.051 --> 43:08.654
It would have to be
the right woman.

43:08.687 --> 43:11.189
* I crawl

43:11.222 --> 43:16.161
* Upon my altar

43:16.194 --> 43:19.097
* And become

43:19.130 --> 43:23.702
* My echo

43:23.735 --> 43:29.641
* I'll become my echo

43:32.778 --> 43:38.349
* Rows of water and wine

43:39.651 --> 43:42.020
* I'll crawl

43:42.053 --> 43:47.258
* Upon my altar

43:47.292 --> 43:50.061
* And become

43:50.095 --> 43:54.966
* My echo

43:55.000 --> 43:57.102
* I'll become

43:57.135 --> 44:00.405
* My echo *
