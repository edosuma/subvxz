Latin lover narrator:
<i>All righty, here we go.</i>

00:02.703 --> 00:05.270
<i>Jane the virgin</i>
<i>got accidentally inseminated.</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:06.538
But I've never had sex!

00:06.540 --> 00:08.040
<i>And this created</i>
<i>a lot of problems</i>

00:08.042 --> 00:09.274
<i>For a lot of people.</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:10.476
<i>First, there was rafael,</i>

00:10.478 --> 00:12.111
<i>The sperm donor</i>
<i>who found himself</i>

00:12.113 --> 00:13.412
<i>Having feelings for jane.</i>

00:13.414 --> 00:15.047
<i>But he first had to deal</i>

00:15.049 --> 00:16.382
<i>With his scheming,</i>
<i>cheating wife.</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.350
We're done, petra.
What?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.419
<i>But petra wasn't going down</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

00:20.421 --> 00:22.254
(groans)

00:22.256 --> 00:23.655
My husband did it.
<i>Pretty dramatic stuff.</i>

00:23.657 --> 00:26.125
<i>Also dramatic-- jane's father,</i>

00:26.127 --> 00:29.661
<i>International telenovela star,</i>
<i>was back in her life.</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:33.065
I was trying to impress you,
but I went too far. I'm sorry.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.300
<i>And speaking of</i>
<i>relationships...</i>
<i>(knocking)</i>

00:35.302 --> 00:37.770
...Jane's mother was interested
in her father. Very <i>interested.</i>

00:37.772 --> 00:41.040
<i>Unfortunately, she had to deal</i>
<i>with his ex-wife melissa.</i>

00:41.042 --> 00:43.442
Maybe send a letter next time.
That's what most fans do.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.110
There are stalker laws,
you know.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.779
<i>But xo was winning so far.</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:49.314
<i>And sadly, jane's love life</i>
<i>was now a mess.</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:51.083
<i>She pushed off any feelings</i>
<i>for rafael</i>

00:51.085 --> 00:52.384
<i>Because she was engaged</i>
<i>to michael.</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:56.088
You knew... All this time.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.457
<i>But she just found out</i>
<i>michael had been lying to her</i>

00:58.459 --> 01:00.125
<i>For a very long time.</i>

01:00.127 --> 01:03.162
D-don't leave.
<i>And that's where we left off.</i>

01:05.098 --> 01:06.665
<i>Jane's 21st birthday party</i>

01:06.667 --> 01:08.200
<i>Can be described in one word--</i>

01:08.202 --> 01:10.402
<i>Epic.</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:12.104
â™ª

01:12.106 --> 01:13.505
(whooping)

01:15.108 --> 01:17.376
(whooping)

01:17.378 --> 01:19.111
Yeah! Yeah!

01:19.113 --> 01:20.746
It's your party.
Take a drink.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.182
(whooping)

01:27.287 --> 01:28.620
(screaming, doorbell ringing)

01:28.622 --> 01:31.623
Yes! Oh, there's some more
people coming.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.159
Excuse me.
(whoops)

01:36.429 --> 01:38.430
Hmm.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.399
Latin lover narrator:
<i>In novelas, this is known</i>

01:40.401 --> 01:42.267
<i>As an</i> encuentro significativo,

01:42.269 --> 01:44.770
<i>Or a "significant encounter."</i>

01:44.772 --> 01:46.705
<i>It's the moment</i>
<i>when two people</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:49.575
<i>Who are meant for each other</i>
<i>have their first encounter.</i>

01:49.577 --> 01:51.710
Excuse me, miss.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.146
There's been a noise complaint
from your neighbors.

01:54.148 --> 01:58.350
<i>In this case, there was</i>
<i>one slight miscalculation.</i>

02:00.286 --> 02:02.221
You got me a stripper?!

02:02.223 --> 02:04.256
(michael mumbles,
woman screaming)
no, no, no, no.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.192
I'm a police officer. No,
there's been a complaint.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.494
I have a complaint.
Your clothes are still on.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.828
Oh, I am an...
I'm an actual cop.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.230
You are too hot
to be a cop.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.165
But not too hot
to be a naked cop!

02:13.167 --> 02:14.733
This looks like a real gun!

02:14.735 --> 02:16.735
(gunshot)

02:16.737 --> 02:19.571
You're a real cop.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.274
(sighs)

02:23.877 --> 02:26.512
<i>Mi amor...</i>

02:26.514 --> 02:28.247
Oh.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.748
Hey, wait.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.817
Now it's snowing
on the yacht.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.819
Snow makes everything
more romantic.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.687
Well, I'm just saying,
shouldn't they have coats on?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.322
I thought you weren't going
to sit here and pick it apart.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.424
Sorry. I'm sorry.
(laughing)

02:42.362 --> 02:45.297
(speaking spanish on tv)

02:47.267 --> 02:49.434
Okay, so...

02:49.436 --> 02:54.306
What do you like
about telenovelas?

02:58.578 --> 03:01.280
The idea that two people
are destined to be together.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.515
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so, jane explained</i>
<i>to michael</i>

03:03.517 --> 03:05.651
<i>Why a man professing his love</i>
<i>to a woman</i>

03:05.653 --> 03:07.352
<i>On a yacht in the snow</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:09.855
<i>In front</i>
<i>of a semi-realistic background</i>

03:09.857 --> 03:12.691
<i>Was the epitome of romance.</i>

03:12.693 --> 03:14.693
So, what's the guy
in the bolero jacket saying now?

03:17.397 --> 03:20.432
"from our first meeting...

03:20.434 --> 03:22.401
I knew it was you."

03:23.536 --> 03:26.205
"I just knew."

03:29.309 --> 03:30.542
Man (over police radio):
Kendall district station...

03:30.544 --> 03:34.279
Uh-oh.
(laughs)

03:34.281 --> 03:36.682
That's me.
Mm-hmm.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.384
Thanks for not
arresting me.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.620
Thanks for asking me
to stay.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.253
(michael laughs)

04:14.255 --> 04:15.721
That's amazing.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.390
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Like I said, it was epic.</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:22.928
<i>But that was then...</i>

04:22.930 --> 04:24.863
<i>And this is now.</i>

04:27.600 --> 04:29.601
You got a package.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.271
Oh, my... My dress.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.007
(sighs)

04:35.009 --> 04:37.342
What are you doing here?

04:37.344 --> 04:39.645
We need to talk. Can
I... Can I come in?

04:39.647 --> 04:42.281
No. I'm not ready
to talk, michael.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.915
Come on, baby.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.951
We just... You know,
we-we got to...

04:45.953 --> 04:47.352
We got to get through this.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.554
I want to get married.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.492
I don't know if I want to.

04:53.494 --> 04:57.029
Jane... Please.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.697
What happened?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.666
Me not telling you
that petra cheated on rafael--

05:00.668 --> 05:02.401
It was... It was awful.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.735
I know that.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.438
I-I am so sorry.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.075
I know you are.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.744
But I just... Keep thinking

05:12.746 --> 05:15.380
About how many times
you lied to me since then.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.515
You're overreacting.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.084
You're, like, hormonal
or something.

05:19.086 --> 05:19.885
Be honest with me.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.320
<i>Okay, michael?</i>

05:21.322 --> 05:22.054
This is not a good time.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.455
You know what? It never is.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.956
And then I just start
thinking about the baby

05:24.958 --> 05:27.092
And how
you were gonna let me give it

05:27.094 --> 05:29.027
To this couple
that had all these problems

05:29.029 --> 05:31.530
When you knew
how much it meant to me

05:31.532 --> 05:33.632
For her to go
to a stable family.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.502
I'm sorry.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.538
(sighs)

05:39.540 --> 05:41.106
I just...

05:41.108 --> 05:43.342
I need more time, michael,
to see

05:43.344 --> 05:45.811
If I can forgive you
and get past this.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.580
Okay.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.655
You okay, baby?

05:56.657 --> 05:58.790
All of a sudden, I just... I...

05:58.792 --> 06:01.059
I look at him differently,

06:01.061 --> 06:04.763
And I don't know
if I can go back.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.901
Yeah, because

06:09.903 --> 06:13.038
Taking it off feels so final.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.573
And you don't want it
to be final?

06:14.575 --> 06:17.576
I don't want any of this.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.444
Oh, my god, enough!
I want to stop crying!

06:19.446 --> 06:20.679
That's what I want!

06:20.681 --> 06:22.047
(sniffles)

06:22.049 --> 06:23.815
What time is dinner
with rogelio?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.084
Oh, honey, let me call him.
We'll cancel.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.986
No, no, I don't want that.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.722
It means he's finally
listening to me

06:30.724 --> 06:32.758
About toning down
the over-the-top gestures.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.526
Besides, I think
it's sweet

06:34.528 --> 06:35.594
He wants us to meet
his stepdaughters.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.162
Former stepdaughters.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.597
Hopefully, they're not
as bitchy as their mom.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.498
Xiomara...

06:39.500 --> 06:40.999
Oh, no.
Oh,    <i>no.</i>

06:41.001 --> 06:42.901
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
What?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.603
There has to be a big mistake.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.006
They gave my student
teaching placement, finally.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.608
Really? Where'd they assign you?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.543
That's the thing. That's
where they made the mistake.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.580
They put you in
a catholic school!

06:55.582 --> 06:56.848
Mom.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.183
It's a high school.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.451
Hello? Hi.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.119
This is jane villanueva,

07:01.121 --> 07:03.155
And I'm in the teaching
education program.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.557
Hi, miranda.
There's been a mistake.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.858
I just got
my assignment

07:06.860 --> 07:08.593
And it says that
I'm teaching at a high school,

07:08.595 --> 07:09.628
But I actually
specified

07:09.630 --> 07:10.629
Very specifically

07:10.631 --> 07:11.630
That I would like

07:11.632 --> 07:12.864
To teach middle schoolers.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.533
Yes, I do understand
that the degree

07:14.535 --> 07:15.634
Is in adolescent education,

07:15.636 --> 07:17.102
But again, I specified...

07:17.104 --> 07:19.504
No, see, but, see, I feel like

07:19.506 --> 07:21.640
I can have the most impact
on younger girls.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.975
No, I-I can't wait
till next semester.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.710
This is my last requirement
for graduation,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.612
And I'm pregnant.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.015
I should have planned better?
Are you serious, miranda?

07:30.017 --> 07:32.551
Wait, no, no, no, miranda,
miranda, miranda, miranda.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.119
I'm sorry.
I should not have snapped.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.120
Listen,

07:35.122 --> 07:37.989
I had a not-so-great experience
in high school.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.224
You know, mean girls...

07:39.226 --> 07:41.693
You get it, right?
Okay?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.228
And... But-but here's the thing:

07:43.230 --> 07:44.863
I want to use that experience

07:44.865 --> 07:46.598
To prevent younger girls,
like middle schoolers,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.200
From becoming mean girls.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.602
That's a part of what being
a teacher, for me, is all about.

07:51.504 --> 07:52.838
Okay.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.906
Thank you. Good-bye.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.810
Looks like I'll be teaching
at a catholic high school.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.512
Maybe you don't tell them
you're a pregnant virgin.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.647
The nuns or the high schoolers?

08:04.984 --> 08:07.552
Thanks, grandma.

08:10.823 --> 08:15.827
(line ringing)

08:15.829 --> 08:16.661
(horn honking)
hello?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.964
Jane, hi.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.131
Sorry, I'm on the bus.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.733
I just wanted to apologize

08:21.735 --> 08:23.268
For what happened yesterday,
when you...

08:23.270 --> 08:24.703
You know, when you said that

08:24.705 --> 08:25.937
You wanted to raise the baby?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.873
I was kind of a jerk.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.042
Oh, you mean when you said that
you would fight me for custody?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.978
Jane, I'm sorry.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.881
You know, I was shocked and...

08:35.883 --> 08:37.782
I didn't mean it.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.784
It's just... And being a father,

08:39.786 --> 08:42.854
Like, a present father,
it's just really...

08:42.856 --> 08:44.055
It's important to me.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.524
And-and we'll work it out.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.758
You know?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.093
You, me and michael.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.162
Yeah, thanks for saying that.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.565
Latin lover narrator:
<i>There was so much more,</i>
<i>of course,</i>

08:53.567 --> 08:55.133
<i>Rafael wanted to say to jane.</i>

08:55.135 --> 08:57.569
<i>Words like</i>
<i>"I have feelings for you"</i>

08:57.571 --> 08:59.237
<i>And "let's be together."</i>

08:59.239 --> 09:00.939
Okay, so I'm almost home.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.007
I... I'll call you later.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.109
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, absolutely.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.810
We'll-we'll talk later.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.879
Bye, jane.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.615
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But alas,</i>
<i>the time wasn't right.</i>

09:10.617 --> 09:11.917
(knocking at door)

09:13.719 --> 09:15.086
What are you doing here?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.788
These guys needed help
finding your apartment.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.790
Rafael solano, you have
the right to remain silent.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.725
Rafael: Wait a... Whoa.
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

09:20.727 --> 09:23.662
You have the right
to an attorney.
Hey, what did you do?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.163
If you can't afford
an attorney,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.731
One will be provided
for you.
Can someone tell me

09:26.733 --> 09:28.733
What the hell
is going on?
I'm sorry, rafael.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.602
I had to tell them what you did.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.876
(exhales)

09:37.878 --> 09:40.011
You have to breathe
from deeper down,

09:40.013 --> 09:41.846
Through your diaphragm.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.014
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Always the gentleman,</i>

09:43.016 --> 09:44.215
<i>Rogelio had agreed</i>
<i>to help xiomara</i>

09:44.217 --> 09:45.917
<i>Prepare for her singing debut</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:47.185
<i>At the hotel.</i>

09:47.187 --> 09:48.353
Whoa. I feel really dizzy.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.655
Oh. You do?
Yeah, could I sit down?

09:50.657 --> 09:52.757
Oh, of course.
Of course, of course.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.759
Do you need
anything?
No, no.
I'm fine.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.262
Oh.
Just a little out of
practice, I think.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.899
I hope my voice
can fill the lounge.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.167
Well, you have
your band.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.301
That's what
they're for.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.171
I... Don't actually
have a band.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.773
I've mostly sung
with backing tracks.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.041
Do you think I need one?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.610
Yes, yes, you do.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.211
But you're in luck,
because I have recorded

10:13.213 --> 10:14.613
Over seven telenovela
theme songs.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.314
Oh. So... Eight.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.949
Eight exactly.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.884
So I have wonderful
musicians I can call.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.853
Really?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.956
You said this was
a big shot for you.

10:26.225 --> 10:27.792
Thank you.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.628
Of course.

10:34.934 --> 10:38.336
Xiomara, I didn't
know you were here.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.043
Rogelio was just
helping me prepare my set.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.144
Oh, yes.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.279
Congratulations.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.348
I'm really glad you're here.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.183
I've been wanting
to apologize.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.820
I was such a bitch
when we first met.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.123
I'm sorry. I didn't know
who you were to him.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.724
Oh.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.092
That's okay.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.227
Good, melissa.
You can make it up

11:02.229 --> 11:03.361
To xiomara
by booking her a band.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.929
My best musicians.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.898
Absolutely. Right away.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.967
Uh, you should
go down to the lobby.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.902
The reporter from telemasivo
is waiting

11:10.904 --> 11:12.103
To interview you.
Ah, yes, yes.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.039
Xiomara, I'll see
you at dinner.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.174
Perfect.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.043
I really look forward

11:18.045 --> 11:20.045
To bringing our
families together.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.713
Oh, thank you for saying that.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.048
Uh, me, too.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.349
And I know jane's
really looking forward

11:24.351 --> 11:26.217
To meeting your daughters.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.920
Stay away from him.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.221
Excuse me?!

11:30.223 --> 11:31.923
Do you think I don't
know your type?

11:31.925 --> 11:32.924
My type?!

11:32.926 --> 11:33.992
You didn't want

11:33.994 --> 11:35.226
A relationship with rogelio

11:35.228 --> 11:36.695
Until you realized
he was famous.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.697
I had lost track of him.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.931
There's a word for that, honey.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.232
Starts with "gold."

11:41.234 --> 11:42.867
Ends with "digging."

11:42.869 --> 11:45.036
Oh, yeah? Well, there's
a word for you, too.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.404
Starts with nasty.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.772
Ends with...

11:47.774 --> 11:49.174
Smile!

11:49.176 --> 11:50.341
#awkwardfamilydinner.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.210
That was funny, valeria.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.146
I'm gonna tweet that
to my 6.3 million followers.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.053
To my former stepdaughters.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.956
You will always be
stepdaughters in my heart.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.026
And I'm so happy you chose
to relocate to miami.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.227
Mom made us 'cause she's
managing your career,

12:09.229 --> 12:11.329
And you wanted to
be closer to jane.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.299
Well, that's not
entirely true.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.433
We moved to miami
because production

12:15.435 --> 12:18.269
Of my show
moved here permanently.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.971
Because you told them you wanted
to be closer to jane.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.239
Details are not important.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.109
What's important is
you are here now.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.411
And you get to meet
the brilliant jane.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.346
My daughter.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.850
Who tomorrow will be a teacher.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.052
Just, like, a student teacher.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.855
I believe teaching
is one of the most

12:36.857 --> 12:39.791
Noble professions
in the world.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.093
So, are you really
a pregnant virgin?

12:45.364 --> 12:47.999
Well, they were asking
about the circumstance,

12:48.001 --> 12:51.136
And I did not want them to
get the wrong idea about you.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.072
Or your incredible purity.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.406
Why haven't you swiped
your "v" card?

12:56.542 --> 12:58.843
Can't find someone
to have sex with you?

12:58.845 --> 13:01.479
Xiomara:
<i>Don't let those girls</i>
<i>get to you.</i>

13:01.481 --> 13:03.047
They're mean like their mom.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.916
I kind of felt bad
for them actually.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.451
Rogelio really went
overboard again.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.454
And I just need to tell him
to tone it down a little more.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.256
(car horn beeps)
rogelio: Jane,

13:11.258 --> 13:13.925
This is for you.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.894
Jane:
You got me a car?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.362
Or a lot more.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.931
What the hell is your problem?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.400
Our drug investigation turned
into a double homicide.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.803
And the latest victim
named sin rostro--

13:24.805 --> 13:26.304
One of the biggest
drug lords around--

13:26.306 --> 13:28.573
As his assailant, and
we don't have any leads.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.409
This is the dead
bellboy's locker, right?

13:31.411 --> 13:34.145
Hey, what's this?

13:36.282 --> 13:38.316
Now we're talking.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.084
Well, call it.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.452
It could be one of
sin rostro's contacts.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.392
Nothing. It's disconnected.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.459
We'll run a history.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.262
Good eye.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.363
(cell phone ringing)

14:03.609 --> 14:06.344
(cell phone dinging)

14:40.379 --> 14:41.946
(school bell ringing)

14:41.948 --> 14:43.414
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which brings us here.</i>

14:43.416 --> 14:46.885
<i>Now, with jane back</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

14:46.887 --> 14:48.453
And, of course,
we do have a code of conduct

14:48.455 --> 14:50.622
Required for all our teachers.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.323
Of course, I understand.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.424
You will have
no conduct issues with me.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.926
Good.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.394
<i>And really, how bad could</i>

14:56.396 --> 14:58.229
A group of teenagers really be?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.465
And here's your classroom.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.070
Oh.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.406
Girls, sister,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.642
Please welcome your new teacher

15:10.644 --> 15:14.445
Ms. Villanueva.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.648
Oh, uh, those girls

15:16.650 --> 15:18.249
In the back,
I know them actually.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.350
Valeria and victoria?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.052
Mm-hmm.
They just transferred.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.153
Apparently their father heard

15:22.155 --> 15:23.388
We had a wonderful faculty.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.455
Valeria:
Oh, my god...

15:24.457 --> 15:25.523
This is,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.425
This is really awkward.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.261
But we thought this was
a catholic school.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.563
Oh, it is. Of course.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.533
Then, why are we being taught
by an unmarried pregnant woman?

15:40.005 --> 15:41.706
Maybe we can talk in private?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.378
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted that</i>
<i>this was the first time</i>

15:47.380 --> 15:50.415
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>had ever</i>

15:50.417 --> 15:52.417
<i>Been called</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

15:52.419 --> 15:54.085
A pregnant virgin?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.286
Due to a medical mistake.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.288
And I absolutely
should've disclosed it.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.257
But I'm sure you
can understand

15:59.259 --> 16:01.059
It's a pretty
unconventional situation.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.528
Yes. It really is.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.463
The problem,
ms. Villanueva,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.965
Is that what just happened

16:06.967 --> 16:10.201
Will be repeated by students
to their parents.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.470
And I will explain how I
took an unfortunate incident

16:12.472 --> 16:14.739
And turned it into
a thoughtful choice.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.708
That's certainly true.

16:16.710 --> 16:20.178
I-I believe that I have a
lot to offer these girls.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.714
Just give me a chance, please.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.283
No more drama?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.151
You have my word. No more drama.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.587
Victoria, valeria,
please come in.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.993
Say hi to your
slutty mom for us.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.394
I am so not slutty!

16:36.396 --> 16:38.463
You asked me to tell you
exactly what they said.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.497
She's right. I heard.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.065
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.467
You got to put those girls
in their place.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.035
You want me to help?
I can go after their mom.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.104
No, stop.
No one's going after anyone.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.306
The girls are clearly acting out
because they're jealous.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.475
I'll talk to rogelio,
and he can deal with them.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.477
And, you, do not engage
with their mom.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.345
Be the bigger person.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.646
That's so not her style.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.016
It is too my style.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.019
(groans)

17:01.021 --> 17:02.687
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It was definitely</i>
<i>not her style.</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:04.322
<i>But still,</i>
<i>xiomara was determined</i>

17:04.324 --> 17:06.391
<i>To take jane's advice.</i>

17:06.393 --> 17:08.793
I really appreciate
you arranging the band.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.295
I know this situation
must be hard for you.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.797
Thank you, xiomara.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.066
I appreciate it.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.472
Meet the girls in your band.

17:22.408 --> 17:23.808
And yes.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.809
Rogelio has slept

17:24.811 --> 17:27.745
With every single
one of them.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.581
(quiet laugh)

17:30.583 --> 17:31.749
Oh, wait, rogelio!
Oh, jane!

17:31.751 --> 17:32.817
Hey!

17:32.819 --> 17:34.152
I was so excited
when you tweeted

17:34.154 --> 17:35.486
You wanted to meet up.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.155
Unfortunately,
I'm on my way to the set.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.290
Maybe you could come
by since you have the car?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.691
No, no, actually I can't.
I have to work.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.826
But this won't take any time.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.628
I wanted to talk to
you about the twins.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.329
They're in your school!
Because melissa wanted them

17:45.331 --> 17:46.531
Under your influence.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.665
How could I argue? No?
Right.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.267
Well, here's the thing.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.169
Um, you know,
they're a little disruptive.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.172
What?
Yeah, I mean, it's fine now.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.207
But I wanted to talk to you
about where it's coming from.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.842
Oh, yes. Yes, good.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.178
Because I've been trying to help
with their behavior, but...

18:00.180 --> 18:01.612
Rogelio, clearly
they're jealous, which I get.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.147
You know, you've been going
a little overboard

18:03.149 --> 18:04.715
On the attention again.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.551
In... In what way?

18:06.553 --> 18:08.352
The car.
Oh!

18:08.354 --> 18:09.854
Yes, well, thank you

18:09.856 --> 18:11.422
For alerting me to
the problem, jane.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.124
I will take care
of it right away.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.392
Okay, great, great.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.094
Thanks.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.228
(sighs)

18:17.230 --> 18:19.630
Hey!

18:19.632 --> 18:20.798
You okay?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.867
Well, not great.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.136
Considering I spent
the night in jail.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.138
Why were you in jail?!

18:27.140 --> 18:28.172
She said you hit her?

18:28.174 --> 18:29.107
Yes, and I didn't.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.109
She just wants... Leverage.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.144
More money
in the divorce settlement.

18:33.146 --> 18:36.414
And just so you know,
I would never lay a hand on her.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.816
And I can't even believe
I have to say that.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.285
You don't.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.555
I believe you.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.625
I... I thought
my life was complicated.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.627
What's going on with you?

18:49.629 --> 18:50.661
I have

18:50.663 --> 18:52.497
Evil stepsisters suddenly...

18:52.499 --> 18:54.899
Who are enrolled in the school
that I'm teaching at,

18:54.901 --> 18:57.201
Which is totally taking me back
to high school,

18:57.203 --> 18:58.736
Which was not
the happiest place for me.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.505
Wait, what happened
in high school?

19:00.507 --> 19:03.808
My mom dated this popular girl's
dad, and it ended badly.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.910
And she turned everyone
against me.

19:05.912 --> 19:09.380
I can't imagine
anyone intimidating you.

19:10.749 --> 19:14.352
Well... I-I, I was different
in high school.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.255
Kind of quiet and shy.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.924
And... You wouldn't
have noticed me.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.293
Of course
I would've noticed you.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.733
Anyway, uh,

19:28.735 --> 19:30.735
There's nothing like
spending the night in jail.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.504
Yeah, yeah.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.574
Um... I can't believe

19:36.576 --> 19:39.844
Michael didn't tell you
about the arrest.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.612
(clicks tongue)

19:41.614 --> 19:45.516
Well, uh, we...

19:45.518 --> 19:48.486
Are actually
having problems, so...

19:49.588 --> 19:51.222
Oh?

19:51.224 --> 19:52.290
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And there it was...</i>

19:52.292 --> 19:53.291
Yeah.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.592
<i>...Briefly.</i>

19:54.594 --> 19:56.961
<i>An opening.</i>

19:59.264 --> 20:00.932
Anyway...

20:00.934 --> 20:02.400
I should get back to work.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.935
Yes.

20:03.937 --> 20:05.970
Yeah, okay. Well, uh,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.438
We'll-we'll talk later?
Mm-hmm.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.941
All right.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.480
Xiomara? Can we talk?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.251
You have to understand,
when jane looks at you,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.887
She just keeps remembering
this sequence of events

20:22.889 --> 20:24.989
In her head--
the pregnancy, the lying.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.291
How do I get that
out of her head?

20:27.293 --> 20:28.893
I don't know.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.428
Maybe with time?

20:30.430 --> 20:33.397
Is she still wearing her ring?

20:40.606 --> 20:42.573
Seriously, did you
punch yourself?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.342
Rafael, stop.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.843
You and I both
know what happened.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.911
No.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.279
We don't.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.814
But we know what's happening.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.848
Oh, good!

20:50.850 --> 20:53.618
Then we both know the solution.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.286
Fine.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.955
Get the hell out.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.357
I'm not going anywhere.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.292
What's yours is mine, remember?

21:01.294 --> 21:03.427
(knocking)

21:07.733 --> 21:09.433
Hey, I got a delivery.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.501
A roman zazo.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.769
Roman zazo's dead.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.271
No, this <i>is</i> roman zazo.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.705
Want to sign?

21:14.707 --> 21:16.507
Here.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.509
It's your problem now.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.644
Excuse me.

21:30.722 --> 21:32.390
Hi.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.292
Hi.
What are you doing?

21:34.294 --> 21:36.294
Ro gave us cars
because he felt bad.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.295
What?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.496
Thanks for talking
to him.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.403
Oh...

21:45.405 --> 21:46.337
Okay.

21:55.714 --> 21:57.615
(grunting)

21:57.617 --> 21:59.483
Oh, my gosh.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.751
(giggling)

22:00.753 --> 22:02.486
(laughs and mumbles)

22:04.990 --> 22:06.457
All right, that's right.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.559
Why don't you guys erase
that picture?

22:08.561 --> 22:11.395
No, no, come on,
ser-seriously, guys.

22:11.397 --> 22:12.563
Okay, all right.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.565
Stop, erase that photo.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.700
No way.

22:15.702 --> 22:16.967
It's perfect for
our web site.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.502
What web site?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.738
You haven't seen
it? Show her.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.841
People are posting the most
hilarious comments about you.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.810
Okay, just take that down.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.678
Both:
No!

22:27.680 --> 22:29.680
Help!
(screams)

22:29.682 --> 22:31.916
What are you doing?!
What happened?

22:31.918 --> 22:34.051
This crazy teacher smashed
my sister's tablet.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.520
I did not.
Yes, she did.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.556
The teacher's
going psycho.
(stammers)

22:38.558 --> 22:39.757
I-I did not smash it.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.058
That is not true.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.360
Leave my sister alone!
She smashed it.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.595
That is a lie! You're a liar.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.097
What is going on here?

22:46.099 --> 22:47.398
I'm sorry, sister margaret.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.368
This is exactly
the kind of drama

22:50.370 --> 22:52.703
I warned you not
to bring to this school.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.107
Girls, report to my office.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.109
And you, ms.
Villanueva...

22:58.111 --> 22:59.877
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Though not a math teacher,</i>

22:59.879 --> 23:02.513
<i>Jane unfortunately knew</i>
<i>the answer to this problem.</i>

23:04.082 --> 23:06.417
This just isn't working out.

23:12.924 --> 23:14.759
I cannot put off graduation.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.128
I have been in school
for six years while working,

23:17.130 --> 23:18.996
And this is my last requirement.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.532
I have to finish now
because I have a baby coming,

23:21.534 --> 23:22.800
And I would really like...

23:22.802 --> 23:24.635
Miranda, I'm just gonna say it.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.705
You really don't have
a lot of compassion.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.511
I can't believe this.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.782
Okay, jane, listen up.

23:37.784 --> 23:38.716
I took your advice, right?

23:38.718 --> 23:39.717
With melissa?

23:39.719 --> 23:40.718
I stayed above the fray.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.586
And-and you were right.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.422
I mean, it's not the band
that I would have chosen,

23:44.424 --> 23:45.423
But it's working.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.691
What's your point, ma?

23:47.693 --> 23:49.760
Now it's your turn
to listen to me.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.797
Because I know how to take down
16-year-old bitches.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.142
Back off--
he clearly smiled at me.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.811
Hey, girls.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.078
Want to go for a swim?

24:08.080 --> 24:09.747
Yeah, definitely.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.048
You hate getting
your hair wet.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.583
Shut up, I do not.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.884
Come on, I'll race you.

24:22.727 --> 24:25.696
(speaking in spanish)

24:25.698 --> 24:26.831
All right, all right.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.165
Tell her you love
her already.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.737
Oh, he's got
to be kidding me.

24:33.739 --> 24:34.839
Petra.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.741
I can live
without air and water.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.911
Well, what do you
want me to do, huh?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.180
If we move out of here,
we're abandoning the property.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.215
And it's
all we have left.

24:44.217 --> 24:45.249
He's frozen
my accounts.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.917
Where are you going?

24:46.919 --> 24:50.888
I have to use the commode; lunch
isn't sitting well with me.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.891
Mother, they've turned off
the water, you can't flush.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.193
Ugh.

25:01.132 --> 25:03.167
(cell phone ringing)

25:09.508 --> 25:11.509
Hello.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.577
Look, ivan, I'm working on it.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.781
I'm... Rafael and I are
having some problems.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.083
I don't have access to cash...

25:21.052 --> 25:24.054
Yes.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.290
Don't worry, you'll have it
by tomorrow night.

25:31.763 --> 25:33.130
Rafael:
<i>Did you get some good stuff?</i>

25:33.132 --> 25:34.131
Oh, yeah.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.833
My mom is right.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.868
The secrets of these teenagers'
lives are in these phones.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.904
Ah, I should have listened
to her in high school

25:39.906 --> 25:41.672
And stood up
to those mean girls.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.941
Mmm... You know, if I was
in high school with you,

25:43.943 --> 25:45.309
I would have set them straight.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.912
Like I said,
you wouldn't have noticed me.

25:47.914 --> 25:48.846
Yes, I would have.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.247
No, you wouldn't.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.315
Okay, you're probably right,
I wouldn't.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.253
But look at what
I would have been missing.

25:58.023 --> 26:00.090
(cell phone chimes)

26:02.561 --> 26:03.594
Everything okay?

26:03.596 --> 26:04.929
Mm-hmm, yeah.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.931
Mike wants to talk.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.933
Oh.

26:08.935 --> 26:12.603
Um...

26:12.605 --> 26:16.674
How are you, uh, you
feeling about everything?

26:19.778 --> 26:20.978
I don't know.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.714
There's just
so much to consider.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.850
Latin lover narrator: <i>And</i>
<i>there it was again, an opening.</i>

26:26.852 --> 26:29.853
Yeah...

26:29.855 --> 26:32.790
Including the fact
that I have feelings for you.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.826
What?

26:35.828 --> 26:37.695
Look, I know
this is a horrible time,

26:37.697 --> 26:39.363
But it... Just in case it...

26:39.365 --> 26:42.199
In case it means anything
or if it changes anything.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.735
Uh...

26:44.737 --> 26:46.937
I don't understand.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.806
You said you see me as a sister.

26:48.808 --> 26:49.807
We talked about this.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.908
I-I know, and I did.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.144
But then something changed.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.381
I've never felt this type
of connection with anyone

26:57.383 --> 27:00.017
In my entire life.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.386
A-and we're having a baby,
you know?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.357
Look, jane,
this-this is crazy, I know.

27:06.359 --> 27:09.827
But I've never been
the type of guy that believes

27:09.829 --> 27:12.730
In fate or destiny.

27:12.732 --> 27:16.033
What are the chances, huh?

27:16.035 --> 27:18.636
I mean, we kissed
five years ago,

27:18.638 --> 27:21.138
And now we're-we're-we're here.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.007
It sounds crazy,

27:23.009 --> 27:26.076
But doesn't this just all
kind of feel meant to be?

27:29.981 --> 27:33.117
I know it's a lot,
a-and you need to think,

27:33.119 --> 27:35.653
But I just, I
had to tell you.

27:45.230 --> 27:48.065
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so rafael left jane</i>
<i>with a terrifying thought.</i>

27:48.067 --> 27:50.134
<i>A thought she couldn't</i>
<i>even say aloud.</i>

27:59.711 --> 28:00.978
You came so soon.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.146
Must be a good sign.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.081
Look, I meant it, rafael.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.316
Half my original ask, and I'll
be out of your hair for good.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.351
I don't think so.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.420
Can we come in?

28:12.090 --> 28:14.058
Do you know olivia?

28:14.060 --> 28:16.326
I don't think so, no.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.028
We do know each other,
mrs. Solano.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.798
Olivia's one of the many women
who changes our sheets

28:20.800 --> 28:21.965
And cleans
our bathrooms.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.100
In any case,

28:23.102 --> 28:24.234
Olivia saw you
leaving my office

28:24.236 --> 28:25.936
The day that you claim
I hit you.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.739
And she's ready
and willing to testify

28:28.741 --> 28:31.041
That you left
without a scratch.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.443
You know what the penalty is

28:32.445 --> 28:34.044
For making a false
assault claim, petra?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.779
Hmm?

28:35.781 --> 28:38.048
You could go
to prison.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.118
I don't remember
seeing you there.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.953
Apparently.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.955
Then again, you didn't even
recognize me just now.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.824
I guess it's her word
against yours.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.793
Drop the charges,
get out of my suite now.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.135
I have to pack.

28:58.137 --> 29:02.106
Oh.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.207
And don't forget your boyfriend.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.313
Hi there.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.814
Hey, jane.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.050
Your web site's
really taking off.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.051
I know.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.053
It-it actually inspired me.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.055
Yeah, I decided to make
a web site of my own.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.323
About you two.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.892
And I've got
plenty of material.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.160
Ooh.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.295
Unflattering selfies,
pre-nose-job shots.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.365
And what seem to appear
as some personal pictures

29:28.367 --> 29:31.301
Meant for, I don't know,
boyfriends?

29:31.303 --> 29:33.003
How'd you get those?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.938
Doesn't matter.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.540
You're gonna take down
that web site.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.342
Then you're gonna go
to sister margaret frances

29:38.344 --> 29:40.177
And tell her
what happened yesterday

29:40.179 --> 29:42.513
And get me my job back now.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.047
(crying)
stop crying.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.049
But mom's
gonna kill us.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.151
Look, you should have thought
about that before.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.218
Easy for you to say.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.353
You have these
amazing parents.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.088
Our mom is horrible.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.356
And we don't know
where our dad is.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.057
Stop crying.
I'm sorry, I can't.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.126
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It was one of those moments.</i>

29:56.128 --> 29:57.327
Stop it, vic.

29:57.329 --> 30:01.265
<i>When you see someone</i>
<i>differently.</i>

30:01.267 --> 30:03.233
We weren't
telling the truth.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.569
We smashed our own tablet
and started yelling.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.237
Ms. Villanueva
didn't do anything.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.539
Excuse me?

30:08.541 --> 30:10.107
But, like you said--

30:10.109 --> 30:12.075
Teachers must be role models.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.044
And the church
teaches forgiveness.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.345
And I forgive them.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.948
And I ask that
you forgive me, as well,

30:17.950 --> 30:21.919
For all the drama
because I know,

30:21.921 --> 30:24.588
I just know I can be
a real asset here.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.924
I think she can, too.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.926
Sister margaret:
You're not off the hook, girls.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.928
We understand.
We're sorry.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.996
Well, there's nothing
we can do about the past,

30:32.998 --> 30:34.398
So let's just move forward.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.466
Report back
to work Monday.

30:40.171 --> 30:44.074
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so jane the virgin left</i>
<i>with her job intact</i>

30:44.076 --> 30:47.144
<i>And her heart full</i>
<i>of forgiveness.</i>

31:00.091 --> 31:02.192
I didn't think
you'd let her stay.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.994
But I'm glad you did.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.496
She really seems
like a good girl.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.333
She does, doesn't she?

31:09.335 --> 31:11.635
Also there's this.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.473
5,000 followers
in two days.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.342
Hundreds of comments.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.077
They want to meet her.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.145
This might help bring
people to the church.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.671
Why the marina?

31:47.673 --> 31:51.074
Because this is now
ours for the evening.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.176
I know it's
not a yacht.

31:53.178 --> 31:54.544
It's just a
patrol boat,

31:54.546 --> 31:56.580
So we may have to pick
up a couple, uh...

31:56.582 --> 31:58.215
Drunk boaters
along the way...
Michael,

31:58.217 --> 31:59.549
Michael...
I tried to
make it snow,

31:59.551 --> 32:01.318
But those machines are
ridiculously expensive.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.185
You shouldn't have done this.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.588
(sighs)

32:04.590 --> 32:07.124
I had to.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.059
Because when you...
You think about me now,

32:09.061 --> 32:11.328
You're just thinking
about what happened,

32:11.330 --> 32:13.063
All the mistakes
I've made...

32:14.966 --> 32:17.601
And you need to stop
thinking about that.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.304
You need to remember
the important stuff.

32:20.306 --> 32:23.240
I know you, jane.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.975
You believe in
"meant to be."

32:24.977 --> 32:27.611
We just have to
find our way back.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.247
Please, jane,
forgive me.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.216
I do.

32:33.218 --> 32:36.086
I forgive you.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.487
But I-I...

32:37.489 --> 32:39.122
I can't be with you.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.393
I can't go back.
I'm sorry, michael.

32:46.097 --> 32:48.165
I don't under...
Uh, I don't...

32:48.167 --> 32:49.199
Something's changed.
Nothing's
changed.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.234
I just, I can't explain it,

32:51.236 --> 32:52.369
But something... It-it is...
Jane, jane,
jane. Jane.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.471
This... This...

32:54.473 --> 32:55.706
This doesn't
make sense.

32:55.708 --> 32:58.375
I mean, what...
What, is it...

32:58.377 --> 33:00.377
Because I lied?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.245
Latin lover narrator:
Of course, it wasn't just that.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.580
<i>There was also...</i>

33:05.283 --> 33:08.418
<i>But jane would never</i>
<i>say that aloud.</i>

33:08.420 --> 33:10.153
<i>Ever.</i>

33:10.155 --> 33:12.389
I'm so sorry, michael.

33:23.368 --> 33:24.501
I'm sorry.

33:42.387 --> 33:44.454
â™ª

33:45.390 --> 33:47.290
Jane!
How lucky.

33:47.292 --> 33:49.326
I was waiting for you.
I hoped I'd see you drive up

33:49.328 --> 33:50.761
In your car.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.229
Right.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.430
Um...

33:53.432 --> 33:55.065
I actually took the bus.

33:55.067 --> 33:58.035
I'm sorry, I can't keep the car.
Why?

33:58.037 --> 34:00.037
Because it's completely
inappropriate.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.271
And giving the twins cars

34:01.273 --> 34:02.672
Was completely inappropriate.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.241
But you said they were
jealous of yours.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.242
Yeah, that's the point.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.610
Nobody should have a car.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.445
They're just big,
meaningless gestures,

34:08.447 --> 34:09.546
And we talked
about how

34:09.548 --> 34:10.781
You weren't going
to be doing

34:10.783 --> 34:12.349
Any big, meaningless gestures.

34:13.751 --> 34:16.453
A car isn't meaningless
to me, jane.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.091
I know this is very,
very hard to believe,

34:21.093 --> 34:22.459
But up until five years ago,

34:22.461 --> 34:25.429
I was barely getting by.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.397
I could only afford
to buy myself a car

34:27.399 --> 34:29.466
When I was 35.

34:29.468 --> 34:31.101
32 if anyone asks.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.603
And then I met you,
and, well...

34:33.605 --> 34:35.472
You have your life set.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.740
You're a grown-up.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.309
Engaged, working,
getting your degree...

34:39.311 --> 34:40.577
Pregnant.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.313
I missed all the big things,

34:43.315 --> 34:45.749
So I wanted to do something,

34:45.751 --> 34:48.151
As a father, so I thought...

34:48.153 --> 34:49.419
A car.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.321
You have so much
going on.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.190
That way, you won't
have to spend time

34:53.192 --> 34:55.625
Waiting for the bus.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.461
So...

34:57.463 --> 35:00.497
A little misguided, yes,

35:00.499 --> 35:02.165
But it wasn't meaningless.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.102
Well, I can actually use a car

35:05.104 --> 35:06.870
Now that I don't have
michael driving me around.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.672
Oh, no, what happened?

35:08.674 --> 35:12.409
It turns out you didn't miss
all the big things.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.280
Hi, mom. What's up?

35:17.282 --> 35:19.516
Uh, xiomara,

35:19.518 --> 35:21.751
We must have gotten
our signals crossed.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.523
What?
I thought you weren't
comfortable with the girls.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.425
You liar.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.460
You set me up.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.729
Jane, sometimes,
you know, things happen,

35:32.731 --> 35:34.664
And afterwards
we see people differently.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.199
Yes, exactly.

35:36.201 --> 35:37.434
Xiomara:
Rogelio?

35:37.436 --> 35:40.270
You ex-wife told the
band not to come.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.438
It was
a miscommunication.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
A miscommunication?
Are you serious?

35:43.442 --> 35:45.142
I'm gonna let
you handle this one.
Uh...

35:45.144 --> 35:46.409
Break a leg,
mom.

35:46.411 --> 35:47.444
Well?

35:47.446 --> 35:48.512
You two just ruined

35:48.514 --> 35:50.413
A beautiful moment

35:50.415 --> 35:51.848
Between me and my daughter,
so what's this about?

35:51.850 --> 35:53.283
It was a simple
misunderstanding

35:53.285 --> 35:55.285
That xiomara's
blown completely...

35:55.287 --> 35:56.720
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And xiomara had</i>
<i>come between them.</i>

35:56.722 --> 35:58.455
<i>It was one of those moments</i>

35:58.457 --> 36:00.524
<i>When you see everything</i>
<i>differently.</i>

36:03.327 --> 36:05.695
How will we live
in this tiny room?

36:05.697 --> 36:08.231
I don't have any cash, mother.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.866
We're very lucky rafael
let us stay the night.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.334
(knocking at door)

36:11.336 --> 36:12.702
Our toilet paper.

36:15.206 --> 36:16.940
Ivan...

36:16.942 --> 36:18.675
You are
switching rooms?
No.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.343
What, you thought
I would not find you?
No, no, no, no.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.411
Please, keep
your voice down.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.646
I-I... Like
I told you,

36:22.648 --> 36:23.947
I'm having some trouble
with my husband.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.315
I just need a little
bit more time.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.783
You have no more time!

36:26.785 --> 36:28.318
Okay.
Magda:
My daughter

36:28.320 --> 36:30.387
Is not getting
shot tonight.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.489
I saw it in
the cards.

36:35.793 --> 36:36.893
Petra:
Oh!

36:40.598 --> 36:42.766
Now what?

36:45.403 --> 36:47.237
(jane whoops)

36:47.239 --> 36:49.506
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.841
We've had a glitch,
unfortunately, no band.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.844
But hey, I haven't performed
with a band before tonight...

36:54.846 --> 36:57.314
So... Here goes.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.449
(patrons cheering)
you got this! (whoops)

37:01.619 --> 37:05.255
(singing lyrically in spanish)

37:37.488 --> 37:39.990
(xiomara continues singing)

38:07.051 --> 38:09.319
Michael:
Nadine.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.920
It's me.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.356
Eli isn't a person,
it's a shipping company.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.825
Sin rostro must be expecting
a big shipment of drugs.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.927
That number that you found
is not a phone number;

38:17.929 --> 38:19.763
It is the answer key.

38:19.765 --> 38:23.366
The slip, the crate,
the dock number...

38:23.368 --> 38:24.834
(laughs)

38:24.836 --> 38:27.837
We're... We're gonna
get him, nadine.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.006
(xiomara singing)

38:32.076 --> 38:34.577
(cheering)

38:34.579 --> 38:36.413
Bravo!

38:36.415 --> 38:38.848
(cheering, whistling)

38:38.850 --> 38:39.949
You were
incredible.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.451
Thanks.
Oh...

38:41.453 --> 38:42.886
It was kind of surreal.
I was so nervous.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.354
Well, you
didn't look it.

38:44.356 --> 38:45.789
No, you
looked like

38:45.791 --> 38:46.856
You belonged
up there.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.958
Thank you,
baby.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.827
So we didn't even get to talk.
The twins really confessed?

38:50.829 --> 38:53.463
Yeah, they did.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.931
Probably should have
taken your advice

38:54.933 --> 38:56.733
Back in high school,
when I was dealing

38:56.735 --> 38:57.967
With stephanie
kovakovich.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.803
(laughs)
or...

38:59.805 --> 39:00.937
Maybe I shouldn't have

39:00.939 --> 39:03.106
Dated her father
to begin with.

39:03.108 --> 39:07.477
Well, yeah, yeah,
that's for sure.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.713
Eh.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.014
I'll leave you
two alone.

39:17.455 --> 39:18.888
Congrats,
mom.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.023
Thank you.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.930
You were perfection.

39:28.399 --> 39:29.999
And I must apologize
for melissa.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.569
Xiomara, I owe her a lot

39:32.571 --> 39:35.839
And I tend to look the other way
when she's possessive.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.040
But I won't do that.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.942
Not with you.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.683
You're too important to me.

39:46.685 --> 39:47.984
In a short time,

39:47.986 --> 39:50.387
You have become too important.

39:54.592 --> 39:55.925
We can't.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.996
You have to focus on your
relationship with jane,

39:59.998 --> 40:01.664
And I'll only
get in the way.

40:01.666 --> 40:02.899
No.

40:02.901 --> 40:03.967
No, you won't.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.835
I already did,
when I...

40:05.837 --> 40:07.437
Interrupted you two
earlier, right?

40:07.439 --> 40:09.439
Look,
historically,

40:09.441 --> 40:11.574
My romances haven't
always gone well,

40:11.576 --> 40:13.910
And that's
affected jane.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.880
If we don't work,
there could be tension,

40:16.882 --> 40:18.581
It could be awkward,
and... That could

40:18.583 --> 40:22.552
End up complicating her
relationship with you.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.521
I just can't risk that.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.523
Yeah, well...

40:26.525 --> 40:27.991
That makes sense.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.627
But I wish it didn't.

40:30.629 --> 40:34.164
Yeah, I know.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.065
Me, too.

40:38.068 --> 40:40.537
â™ª

40:45.776 --> 40:47.644
Rafael:
Hey.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.945
Hey.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.947
I saw you come out here.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.116
You looked... Kind of upset.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.218
Yeah.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.687
Didn't want to ruin
my mom's night, so...

40:59.056 --> 41:00.723
What happened?

41:00.725 --> 41:02.592
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And that's when</i>
