02:31.093 --> 02:34.031
Last January I finally
singed Martin Whistler

02:34.032 --> 02:36.135
out on one of the rim planets.

02:36.136 --> 02:39.372
Since then, I've been hunting down
the last of his murdering cult.

02:39.540 --> 02:43.801
We call them Trancers.
Slaves to Whistler's psychic power.

02:44.118 --> 02:46.837
Not really alive, not dead enough.

02:46.877 --> 02:50.362
It's July now... and I'm tired.

02:50.486 --> 02:52.807
Real tired.

02:53.552 --> 02:57.700
Give me a chop steak medium.
You deep fry your pods?

02:57.701 --> 02:59.644
Sure do, honey.

02:59.645 --> 03:03.422
Give me a side a pods and
a large Coke, no ice.

03:21.383 --> 03:23.443
And what will you have, Mister?

03:23.963 --> 03:25.677
Coffee.

03:25.765 --> 03:28.609
The real stuff? That's gonna cost you.

03:28.610 --> 03:31.912
I deserve it. Find me some milk.
I don't want none of that soy crap.

03:31.913 --> 03:32.972
Coming up.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.710
Evening, citizen.

03:51.613 --> 03:53.447
Jack Deth, Angel City PD.

03:53.448 --> 03:55.122
May I see your stats?

03:55.123 --> 03:57.405
- What did I do?
- Under Section Seven of the Penal

03:57.406 --> 04:00.724
code the Council authorizes me to
administer a Trancer suspect examination.

04:00.725 --> 04:03.111
You can't give me a TSE
without a warrant!

04:03.112 --> 04:05.605
- I got your warrant right here!
- Okay, okay.

04:05.606 --> 04:08.866
- I don't want any trouble.
- Hold out your left arm.

04:09.066 --> 04:11.856
I got nothing to hide.

04:12.535 --> 04:14.753
Negative.

04:15.698 --> 04:18.264
Look out!

04:18.880 --> 04:20.861
Hey! You can't singe an old lady!

04:20.862 --> 04:23.790
She's a Trancer, Goddammit! Help me!

06:05.786 --> 06:07.878
Not so fast.

06:07.879 --> 06:09.880
- I'm not in the mood, McNulty.
- I'm not in the mood

06:09.881 --> 06:12.438
- for troopers who dodge their assignments.
- Shuttle pad duty is for squids.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.333
I ain't got the time.

06:13.334 --> 06:15.661
Trancer hunting is out of
bounds and you know it!

06:16.309 --> 06:19.968
The Department had a belly full
of your one man crusade, Jack.

06:20.234 --> 06:22.941
Whistler may be dead, but someone's
got to mop up the strays.

06:22.942 --> 06:25.350
Now, I singed one just now.
The scorch is inside.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.779
Jack...

06:27.780 --> 06:29.451
Jack.

06:29.452 --> 06:31.263
It's straight from the Captain...

06:31.264 --> 06:34.794
"You'll take your assignments
or you'll take a hike".

06:52.105 --> 06:54.311
He was a good cop.

06:54.312 --> 06:57.253
Until a Trancer killed his wife.

06:57.761 --> 07:00.860
Come on let's get the clods.

08:17.232 --> 08:20.052
I figured I'd find you out here.

08:22.426 --> 08:25.015
You see the guardsmen?

08:25.016 --> 08:27.791
- On your feet, Trooper.
- Ex-Trooper.

08:27.793 --> 08:30.812
I stand for no one, McNulty.

08:33.554 --> 08:37.147
- What's this?
- A summon from the Council.

08:49.601 --> 08:51.990
Jack, you can't ignore the summons!

08:51.991 --> 08:54.184
- It's the highest honor there is!
- You know, Lieutenant.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.225
I think I found the old
Chinese Theater out there.

08:56.226 --> 08:58.294
I'm going to back in the water
before the storm blows in.

08:58.295 --> 09:01.341
Dammit, Jack!
The Council needs you.

09:02.711 --> 09:05.218
Fuck'em!

09:09.471 --> 09:11.842
Jack...

09:19.982 --> 09:22.658
Whistler's alive!

09:38.489 --> 09:41.271
I'm not cleared to go any further.

09:42.003 --> 09:45.719
- Behave yourself in there.
- Don't get pippy with me, McNulty.

09:46.014 --> 09:48.721
Forget something, smart guy?

10:11.890 --> 10:14.410
Trooper Deth, welcome.

10:14.411 --> 10:15.905
I'm Margaret Ashe.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.094
The gentleman beside me
is Chairman Spencer.

10:19.095 --> 10:20.768
Trooper.

10:20.769 --> 10:22.837
I thought there were three of you?

10:22.838 --> 10:25.554
Van Zant was murdered four days ago...

10:25.555 --> 10:27.431
by Martin Whistler.

10:27.432 --> 10:29.664
Then it's true. Whistler is alive.

10:29.665 --> 10:32.803
Very much so and he intends
to kill both of us.

10:32.804 --> 10:34.437
How could he get to you?

10:34.438 --> 10:37.016
This place is a fortress.

10:37.124 --> 10:39.976
It might as well be made of paper.

10:40.284 --> 10:42.710
I don't follow. Where's Whistler now?

10:42.711 --> 10:44.473
In Los Angeles.

10:44.474 --> 10:47.515
No problem. We get the Submarine
fleet and blow him out of the water.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.773
Whistler is not in the sunken ruins.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.844
He's fled to the thriving metropolis.

10:51.845 --> 10:54.268
As it existed nearly
three hundred years ago.

10:54.269 --> 10:58.083
How can you be sure Whistler's
gone down the line?

11:14.446 --> 11:17.356
Greetings to the Council.

11:17.441 --> 11:22.895
As you may have gathered I have
survived the pathetic traps

11:22.896 --> 11:26.812
set by Trooper Deth on Meacon-7.

11:26.813 --> 11:32.371
For twelve long years you have
hunted my disciples like dogs.

11:33.142 --> 11:37.062
Now my day of vengeance is at hand.

11:37.608 --> 11:40.166
I've synthesized the time drug.

11:40.167 --> 11:45.751
And in a moment shall retreat
down the dark corridors of history.

11:46.543 --> 11:51.234
Know that it is I, who is solely
responsible for your demise.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.435
One by one your ancestors
shall be murdered.

11:55.647 --> 11:59.531
And you their progeny
shall cease to exist.

11:59.532 --> 12:03.260
Then shall I return... join my legions.

12:03.261 --> 12:06.994
And claim the seat of power for my own.

12:12.602 --> 12:15.153
"Adieu".

12:15.563 --> 12:17.907
"Adieu".

12:26.328 --> 12:29.088
I was with Van Zant when it happened.

12:29.981 --> 12:32.190
The man simply vaporized.

12:32.191 --> 12:35.980
As did his poor children and grandchildren.

12:36.035 --> 12:37.730
How do you know Whistler's location?

12:37.731 --> 12:42.425
We monitored a line disruption
in Los Angeles, December 1985.

12:42.449 --> 12:46.482
Van Zant, Ash and I all had
ancestors in the city then.

12:46.483 --> 12:49.662
As did Whistler and yourself, of course.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.160
- Me?
- Yes

12:52.161 --> 12:55.185
Philip Deth, a journalist..

12:55.186 --> 12:57.277
You'll be transferred to his body.

12:57.278 --> 12:59.571
Allowing you to search for Whistler.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.440
There are millions of people in L.A.

13:01.441 --> 13:03.915
We've traced Whistler's ancestral line.

13:03.916 --> 13:07.054
He's using the body of
a man named Weisling.

13:07.055 --> 13:09.801
There is a minor complication.

13:09.802 --> 13:12.404
Weisling is a police detective.

13:12.405 --> 13:15.119
You call that minor?

13:20.089 --> 13:23.345
Trooper Deth, this is Engineer Raines.

13:23.346 --> 13:26.200
Engineer? When did you
get promoted, Ruthie?

13:26.201 --> 13:27.556
Ages ago

13:27.557 --> 13:29.393
Raines will administer the transfer serum.

13:29.394 --> 13:32.214
You'll be in charge of
my bones when I'm gone?

13:32.215 --> 13:35.414
Don't worry, Jack. I
don't hold a grudge.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.285
Will preserve your body
on a suspension table.

13:37.286 --> 13:39.972
Like this one.

13:47.365 --> 13:51.022
- Whistler...
- It's just a shell, really.

13:51.023 --> 13:53.377
His consciousness is in 1985.

13:53.378 --> 13:56.287
Right. But, how did you
get hold of the body?

13:56.288 --> 13:59.203
Our security officers found
it hidden in the desert.

13:59.204 --> 14:01.798
- We're keeping it for the trial.
- Trial?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.659
You don't want Whistler singed?

14:03.660 --> 14:07.128
No, no, your to capture Whistler and
inject him with the serum antidote.

14:07.129 --> 14:09.339
His mind will return to Angel City.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.486
And he'll stand before the high court.

14:11.487 --> 14:14.463
If you think I'm bringing that scum up
the line, you got the wrong trooper.

14:14.464 --> 14:16.260
Unless you stop Whistler...

14:16.261 --> 14:19.804
everything the council has accomplished for
the last 40 years will count for nothing.

14:19.805 --> 14:23.846
We'll be plunged into the same chaos
which followed the Great Quake.

14:24.151 --> 14:27.245
- You're our only hope.
- Then it's on my terms.

14:32.366 --> 14:35.375
My God! What have you done?

14:38.003 --> 14:41.631
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Don't worry justice will be served.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.279
You were wrong to insist on it Trooper.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.993
- We have no choice.
- Such conspicuous display's of firearm's

14:46.994 --> 14:49.210
will not be tolerated.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.911
Raines...

14:54.231 --> 14:56.547
This is a thirty-eight police special.

14:56.548 --> 14:58.976
A traditional firearm of the era.

14:58.977 --> 15:02.009
Yeah, I got one of these in my collection.
But, mine is all rusted out.

15:02.010 --> 15:05.807
Careful! That grip has been modified.

15:06.274 --> 15:07.943
Two injectors of antidote.

15:07.944 --> 15:11.008
One for you, one for Whistler.

15:11.837 --> 15:14.207
- I got an old watch.
- Not like this one.

15:14.208 --> 15:18.297
If you depress this knob,
you'll gain a long second.

15:18.298 --> 15:21.373
- A what?
- One second stretched to ten

15:21.374 --> 15:23.273
for the person holding the device.

15:23.274 --> 15:25.545
Now, while you have complete
freedom of movement

15:25.546 --> 15:28.185
the rest of the world will
appear to have stopped.

15:28.186 --> 15:31.287
I could have used that on our
last date. Let's give it a try.

15:31.288 --> 15:33.998
No, it has a single use generator.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.006
When the long second runs down

15:36.007 --> 15:38.415
the watch will dissolve.
So don't waste it.

15:38.416 --> 15:41.644
Engineer, prepare the injection.

15:42.607 --> 15:44.777
This is my ancestor.

15:46.332 --> 15:49.070
His name and location are
written on the back.

15:49.635 --> 15:52.233
Protect him, please.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.916
What about your ancestor?

15:59.633 --> 16:02.476
"Hap Ashby, 1963 Angels"
What the hell is this?

16:02.477 --> 16:04.794
I'm afraid that's the best I could do.

16:04.795 --> 16:07.068
All I know is he was in Los Angeles

16:07.069 --> 16:09.793
in 1985.

16:10.025 --> 16:12.936
That's swell.

16:13.674 --> 16:15.374
Excuse me.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.856
You'll just feel a little pressure.

16:33.357 --> 16:35.944
Phil, are you okay in there?

16:36.167 --> 16:39.758
Yeah, everything is fine.

16:46.886 --> 16:48.514
Are you sure?

16:48.515 --> 16:50.843
Yeah, fine.

17:30.804 --> 17:33.712
It's after 8:30. I'm going
to be late for work.

17:51.102 --> 17:52.553
We're going to have to
hurry, don't you think?

17:52.554 --> 17:55.811
Yeah, right.

18:13.366 --> 18:16.862
- You're a real slob, Phil.
- What?

18:16.863 --> 18:19.492
I said the closet is really filled.

18:19.626 --> 18:23.456
- Did you mean what you said last night?
- Yeah, sure.

18:25.493 --> 18:27.873
What did I say last night?

18:27.874 --> 18:30.336
Phil, come on! You said
that making love to me

18:30.337 --> 18:33.983
was like the ethereal
union of two lost souls.

18:36.404 --> 18:39.391
- Bet it was.
- What?

18:39.532 --> 18:42.725
I mean lost souls, yeah.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.916
I can't wait until Christmas is over

18:55.917 --> 18:58.482
so I can dump this stupid outfit.

19:06.035 --> 19:09.017
This guy is a real shark.

19:13.351 --> 19:15.245
You better hurry don't you think?

19:15.246 --> 19:17.811
Wait a minute.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.895
Do you know where...

19:21.015 --> 19:24.615
Ca-Cahunja boulevard?

19:24.616 --> 19:26.065
Ca-what?

19:26.066 --> 19:29.866
- C-A-H-U.
- Cahuenga.

19:29.867 --> 19:32.205
It's 10 minutes from here.

19:32.244 --> 19:35.948
Come on, quit screwing around, you
promised to get me to work on time.

19:35.949 --> 19:37.949
Yeah.

19:37.950 --> 19:40.841
Just let me get a coat.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.917
Your wearing that?

19:55.360 --> 19:57.863
Yeah.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.301
I like it.

20:09.003 --> 20:11.849
Phil, if I'm late for work
I'm going to lose my job.

20:34.357 --> 20:36.881
What are you doing?

20:37.412 --> 20:39.234
Dry hair is for squids.

20:39.235 --> 20:42.012
Let's get out of here.

20:42.946 --> 20:46.294
Seemed like kind of an okay guy last night.

21:01.449 --> 21:04.511
- I love this car!
- I guess so.

21:05.175 --> 21:07.725
- Thank you.
- Hey, wait a minute.

21:16.652 --> 21:18.828
- Will I see you tonight?
- What?

21:18.829 --> 21:21.394
Look I got to get to work! Okay?

21:31.679 --> 21:33.175
What did I do wrong?

21:33.176 --> 21:35.146
I don't know maybe you're
schizo or something.

21:35.147 --> 21:37.309
What does that mean?

21:37.310 --> 21:41.181
Last night you said you grew up in L.A. and
today you couldn't find Cahuenga Blvd.

21:41.182 --> 21:43.986
You put that shit in your hair.
You can't even remember my name.

21:43.987 --> 21:47.411
Leena, come here! The kids are waiting.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.762
Your name is Leena.

21:50.763 --> 21:53.157
Did I give you my phone number?

21:53.158 --> 21:55.851
- No.
- Thank God.

21:59.974 --> 22:02.216
Where have you been?
All these kids want pictures.

22:02.217 --> 22:05.629
Santa will see you now, young one.

22:09.442 --> 22:11.464
Hi, can I sit you up a little bit higher?

22:11.465 --> 22:13.544
How come you have blue hair?

22:14.053 --> 22:16.882
Because it's so cold on the North Pole.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.699
And what would you like Santa to
bring you for Christmas this year?

22:30.700 --> 22:36.340
Mr. Potato-head and Hungry, Hungry Hippos,
John Doe the Mandroide.

22:36.404 --> 22:38.945
- Leena I need to talk to you.
- Not now, okay?

22:38.946 --> 22:40.914
Listen, I'm not crazy. I need your help.

22:40.915 --> 22:45.205
A Transformer Decepticon. And...

22:45.508 --> 22:47.388
John Doe the Mandroide.

22:47.389 --> 22:50.763
And the new slot car because my
stupid sister busted my old one.

22:50.764 --> 22:53.802
Hey Santa, are you listening?

22:55.594 --> 22:58.198
What's wrong with Murray?

23:00.044 --> 23:01.959
He's a Trancer.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.416
A what?

23:15.302 --> 23:18.571
- Phil! My God! What are you doing?
- One of your friends?

23:26.528 --> 23:30.467
Security? We've got trouble
at the North Pole.

24:02.697 --> 24:05.359
Hold it... I said it hold it!

24:24.365 --> 24:26.483
Don't shoot!

24:28.675 --> 24:31.386
Mommy, he shot Santa Claus.

24:42.396 --> 24:46.585
Welcome to the 20th century, Jack Deth.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.952
- Come with me, Move!
- No way!

24:57.047 --> 25:00.376
- Hey!
- Don't piss me off.

25:31.435 --> 25:35.397
Medics, get this thing out of here now.

25:38.408 --> 25:42.584
Ma'am, if you feel up to it,
I need to ask you some questions.

25:43.778 --> 25:46.347
I'm Detective Weisling.

25:47.145 --> 25:50.481
Somewhere in all this city are the
two ancestors I got to protect.

25:52.192 --> 25:55.014
Okay, let's say I believe this shit.

25:55.015 --> 25:58.158
You're a cop from the future
and you're chasing this guy, Piper.

25:58.159 --> 25:59.699
Whistler.

25:59.700 --> 26:02.099
Why doesn't he just turn you
into one of these zombie or me?

26:02.100 --> 26:04.248
You're too tough.

26:04.249 --> 26:06.251
- Tough?
- Trancing only works on squids.

26:06.252 --> 26:08.945
People with weak minds, easy to control.

26:09.156 --> 26:12.159
Leena, I won't get
anywhere without a guide.

26:12.410 --> 26:14.547
Are you crazy? You killed Murray!

26:14.548 --> 26:17.918
Has Murray ever turned yellow and gone
after someone like he went for me?

26:17.919 --> 26:18.659
No.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.250
- Of course not.
- I don't have the time.

26:21.251 --> 26:23.477
At least get me to Cahuenga Blvd.

26:23.478 --> 26:26.693
- How about if I get you a map?
- A map isn't good enough.

26:26.694 --> 26:29.144
I'm from another time, another world.

26:29.145 --> 26:32.047
I don't even know what you
people eat for lunch.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.926
Okay, where on Cahuenga?

26:35.927 --> 26:38.438
- So you'll help me.
- Yes.

26:38.439 --> 26:39.397
That's swell.

26:39.398 --> 26:42.400
But I don't want to see that
gun of yours in my face again.

26:42.670 --> 26:45.301
Yeah, sure, anything you say.

26:45.550 --> 26:48.412
That address was 14-something.

26:48.884 --> 26:51.374
Where the hell is that photo?

26:59.620 --> 27:02.545
Thank you, ma'am. If we have any
further questions will call you.

27:02.546 --> 27:05.780
- Merry Christmas.
- Excuse me, Lieutenant.

27:05.781 --> 27:08.706
- Yes?
- We found this lying over there.

27:08.734 --> 27:11.616
It's got an address on the back.

27:19.501 --> 27:22.062
Is this it?

27:22.063 --> 27:24.878
Yes Chris Lavery..

27:35.305 --> 27:36.728
Look, you're not my prisoner.

27:36.729 --> 27:39.457
You don't have to stick around.
But I'd appreciate you waiting for me.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.790
- Relax, Phil.
- Jack, Phil stepped out.

28:02.842 --> 28:04.530
Are you Chris Lavery?

28:04.531 --> 28:07.678
- Yeah, in person.
- Nice tan.

28:07.679 --> 28:10.111
- Very Christmas-y.
- Well, thanks.

28:10.112 --> 28:12.953
So, what will it be, the tube tan
of 10 or the tropic tan of 20?

28:12.954 --> 28:14.955
Huh?

28:23.084 --> 28:26.169
You look a little pale,
you better go for the 20.

28:26.763 --> 28:29.374
Save the hard sell, pal, I'm a cop.

28:30.519 --> 28:33.315
Hey look, if this is
about the guy last week,

28:33.316 --> 28:35.453
he screwed with the thermo.

28:35.454 --> 28:37.632
Anyway, it was just 1st degree burns.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.597
That's not why I'm here...
I got to be blunt.

28:39.598 --> 28:42.299
Someone is going to try to kill you.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.474
- Come on! - And he'll succeed if
you don't fall under my protection.

28:47.875 --> 28:50.584
- You're serious.
- Yeah.

28:54.418 --> 28:57.367
Come on, will talk in my office.

30:25.632 --> 30:27.950
Jack?

30:32.762 --> 30:35.308
Jack?

30:41.499 --> 30:43.222
Oh God!

30:43.223 --> 30:46.322
Don't be dead, Jack!

30:49.467 --> 30:51.711
- How is my tan?
- Are you okay?

30:51.712 --> 30:53.954
- I guess...
- There's this dead muscle guy up there!

30:53.955 --> 30:55.204
Chris Lavery he was tranced.

30:55.205 --> 30:57.459
But this red light came
and he disappeared.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.494
Whistler knows we're here.

30:59.495 --> 31:02.175
I got to get the hell out of here.

31:19.315 --> 31:21.637
Freeze!

31:29.013 --> 31:31.275
So...

31:31.507 --> 31:33.672
we caught the Santa Claus killer...

31:33.673 --> 31:35.808
and his accomplice.

31:35.809 --> 31:38.435
Whistler.

31:38.899 --> 31:41.214
None other.

31:42.143 --> 31:45.277
Farewell, Jack Deth.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.950
Fire.

31:54.180 --> 31:59.344
Fire. Fire. Fire.

33:35.334 --> 33:36.901
Hey, wha...?

33:36.902 --> 33:39.228
Why aren't we dead?

33:50.530 --> 33:52.497
How did he do that?

33:52.498 --> 33:55.367
How indeed.

33:58.918 --> 34:01.939
- I don't think anyone's after us.
- Yeah, well, they will be.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.187
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

34:04.188 --> 34:07.467
When you used that time freezer thing
why didn't you get Whistler right then?

34:07.468 --> 34:11.106
I only had a few seconds, if I had
a singed him, I couldn't save you.

34:13.659 --> 34:17.213
- Oh.
- What is it?

34:17.388 --> 34:20.777
When you went into that
tanning place, I took off.

34:20.777 --> 34:24.065
I was scared. Your story was so weird.

34:24.070 --> 34:25.525
I wouldn't have believed me.

34:25.525 --> 34:28.699
But all that stuff you said about
Murray made sense so I came back.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.181
You ever hear of this guy?

34:37.478 --> 34:40.188
Sixty-three Angels? No,
I wasn't even born then.

34:40.190 --> 34:43.077
Yeah, well we got to find
him before Whistler does.

34:44.348 --> 34:47.187
Leena, we need a place to hold up.

34:47.909 --> 34:50.141
I know, a friend of mine went
out of town for Christmas.

34:50.141 --> 34:53.034
- No one will look for us at her place.
- Which way?

34:53.293 --> 34:55.998
Head east, Chinatown.

35:27.862 --> 35:30.061
<i>Well.</i>

35:46.828 --> 35:48.615
<i>I was crazy, Mr. Gunn.</i>

35:48.616 --> 35:51.086
<i>No, Ma'am.</i>

35:51.087 --> 35:53.304
<i>He stole, Mr. Gunn.</i>

35:53.305 --> 35:56.284
- Hey, what are you watching?
- Some cop show.

35:56.285 --> 35:59.473
- Yuck.
- It ain't bad.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.211
What the hell kind of name is Peter Gunn?

36:02.212 --> 36:04.867
What kind of name is Jack Deth?

36:04.868 --> 36:08.506
Okay, I got fried rice, egg
rolls and beef chow mein.

36:08.507 --> 36:12.249
Beef? You mean, like, from a cow?

36:12.621 --> 36:15.242
Yeah.

36:16.060 --> 36:16.724
Wow.

36:16.725 --> 36:19.089
And I got the radio you wanted
and its got that police band...

36:19.090 --> 36:21.575
and all of that other junk, and...

36:21.576 --> 36:23.888
its got an earphone so I
don't have to listen to it.

36:23.889 --> 36:26.262
And I charged dinner, I hope that's okay.

36:26.263 --> 36:28.953
Yeah, Phil won't mind, will
call it my inheritance.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.397
- What are these?
- Oh, there fortune cookies.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.858
A little message inside.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.223
I'll read yours.

36:38.828 --> 36:41.458
Oh, my God, it's from Whistler.

36:41.934 --> 36:44.625
Read it.

36:44.805 --> 36:48.350
I'll kill you and your
bitchin' girlfriend.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.833
Dammit! How did he find out...

36:55.574 --> 36:58.152
My bitchin' girlfriend?

36:58.153 --> 36:58.928
I'm sorry.

36:58.929 --> 37:01.383
So, I guess you think
that's pretty funny, right?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.581
What the hell is that?

37:04.582 --> 37:06.461
Oh, that's music from the club downstairs.

37:06.462 --> 37:08.392
And when does that cease?

37:08.393 --> 37:10.184
About two or three morning.

37:10.185 --> 37:12.429
- Let's go down there and have some fun!
- No, I don't think so.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.470
Come on, you said you
wanted to get to know L.A.

37:14.471 --> 37:17.620
I have to monitor the police
band, keep tabs on Whistler, okay?

37:17.621 --> 37:18.943
Take it with you.

37:25.441 --> 37:28.608
Candy has some seriously
ugly clothes in here.

37:29.364 --> 37:33.284
Leena, you better lose the blue
streak, you are too easy to identify.

37:33.321 --> 37:35.149
Forget it.

37:35.150 --> 37:37.817
I gave up the T-Bird.

37:37.818 --> 37:41.044
Okay, Mr. Detective.

38:14.096 --> 38:15.805
I see why they call it punks.

38:15.806 --> 38:16.788
Come on, let's dance.

38:16.789 --> 38:18.740
Are you kidding? It's looks
like a room full of Trancers.

38:18.741 --> 38:20.473
Come on!

38:41.547 --> 38:44.793
- Well, how am I doing?
- Not bad for a "squid".

38:54.949 --> 38:56.531
Leena!

38:56.532 --> 38:59.236
How come you don't call me anymore?

38:59.237 --> 39:01.936
Jerry, I asked you to leave me alone, okay?

39:01.937 --> 39:04.027
Well, you still got
some of my tapes, man.

39:04.028 --> 39:06.175
I'll drop them off at your moms.

39:06.206 --> 39:08.871
Beat it high walk, this is my dance.

39:10.044 --> 39:12.589
Whose the old fuck?

39:12.997 --> 39:14.961
Look at that.

39:14.962 --> 39:17.662
He's even got a hearing-aid.

39:21.021 --> 39:22.939
Hey, why don't you buy me a drink?

39:22.940 --> 39:25.880
Shove off pal, or I'm going to
sweep the floor with your head.

39:30.968 --> 39:33.446
Now, I'm pissed.

40:00.374 --> 40:02.909
Jack...

40:08.901 --> 40:11.037
Leena.

40:21.408 --> 40:23.435
Merry Christmas.

40:23.436 --> 40:25.703
- Today?
- After midnight.

40:25.704 --> 40:27.124
December 25.

40:27.125 --> 40:31.364
I didn't know. It's July in Angel City.

40:32.695 --> 40:35.444
Open it.

40:43.069 --> 40:45.263
Ta-da. You like it?

40:45.264 --> 40:47.763
- Yeah.
- Put it down.

40:51.358 --> 40:53.678
- What is this?
- Future Man!

40:53.679 --> 40:56.023
Just like you.

41:00.789 --> 41:04.071
Thank you, that's... that's real nice.

41:04.731 --> 41:06.973
I don't know what to say.

41:07.157 --> 41:09.797
Don't say anything.

41:32.119 --> 41:34.903
Jack...

41:36.186 --> 41:38.121
Where is Phil?

41:38.122 --> 41:40.312
His brain is on hold.

41:40.313 --> 41:42.715
Why?

41:42.716 --> 41:45.021
Because I like you a lot better.

41:53.824 --> 41:56.869
Open up, Jack! Quit stalling!

42:07.848 --> 42:10.289
- What is this?
- It's me.

42:10.290 --> 42:12.676
- McNulty.
- McNulty?

42:13.097 --> 42:15.682
And none of your lip.

42:16.146 --> 42:19.614
This kid is the only
ancestor I could find.

42:19.615 --> 42:21.120
It's been hell.

42:21.121 --> 42:24.112
I had to sneek past the
parents and everything.

42:28.658 --> 42:31.587
Say... whose the skirt?

42:31.588 --> 42:33.817
Nice.

42:34.747 --> 42:36.677
Tone it down will you, McNulty?

42:36.678 --> 42:39.690
Listen, Jack. You to got
come back to Angel City.

42:39.691 --> 42:42.159
Spencer disappeared like a floater trail

42:42.160 --> 42:44.386
and Ashe has gone to pieces.

42:44.387 --> 42:47.203
She wants to talk to you.

42:48.625 --> 42:50.523
Tell her I'm doing my job, okay?

42:50.524 --> 42:53.008
I got my orders, Jack.

42:53.009 --> 42:55.571
Listen, McNulty.
I'm real busy right now.

42:55.572 --> 42:57.552
Hit the bricks, move it.

42:57.553 --> 43:00.252
Run along before I give you a
spanking, do you understand?

43:00.253 --> 43:04.718
Put me down! I'll bust
you to zero, Trooper.

43:06.185 --> 43:07.996
Scram!

43:09.426 --> 43:11.447
Damn.

43:13.414 --> 43:17.155
- Your boss?
- She thinks he is.

44:01.789 --> 44:03.194
He's back.

44:09.157 --> 44:11.674
Damn it, McNulty! Couldn't
you have given me an hour?

44:11.675 --> 44:14.529
Maybe. If you hadn't
given me the bums-rush.

44:14.716 --> 44:16.884
- Shouldn't pick on little kids.
- Listen.

44:16.885 --> 44:20.043
If you don't like my style,
I dump this case right now.

44:20.044 --> 44:23.077
Why do you think I brought you back?

44:23.826 --> 44:25.675
I'm slaggin' your badge.

44:25.677 --> 44:28.058
- On whose authority?
- Mine.

44:28.059 --> 44:30.594
Trooper Deth.

44:32.724 --> 44:35.424
There are two empty chairs
at the council chamber.

44:35.425 --> 44:37.443
There shall not be three.

44:37.444 --> 44:39.869
I've ordered you a replacement.

44:39.870 --> 44:42.530
- Yeah, who?
- One of the Green Squad.

44:42.620 --> 44:44.766
- Lars Kwan.
- Kwan?

44:44.767 --> 44:47.948
He works the hothouses, he's never
singed a Trancer in his life.

44:47.949 --> 44:50.592
Whistler's goons are
massing near Angel City.

44:50.593 --> 44:52.433
Waiting for the Council to fall.

44:52.434 --> 44:54.700
And you didn't protect
Spencer's ancestor.

44:54.701 --> 44:56.805
- You had your shot.
- Don't pull me out now

44:56.807 --> 44:58.402
I'm close to finding Ashby.

44:58.403 --> 45:01.156
The only thing you were close
to was that cotton-candy.

45:01.832 --> 45:03.897
That cotton-candy is my lead, pal.

45:03.899 --> 45:05.666
She going to take me right to Ashby.

45:05.667 --> 45:08.459
- Is it true?
- Would I lie?

45:15.829 --> 45:18.288
- Very well.
- It's a mistake.

45:18.319 --> 45:21.557
- Kwan is the better man.
- I've made my decision.

45:21.558 --> 45:24.249
Now it's up to fate.

45:25.159 --> 45:28.191
Good luck, Trooper Deth.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.490
Say Ruthie, that long second
gag really worked out.

45:32.491 --> 45:35.644
- How about a refill.
- Will send one down the line.

45:36.566 --> 45:38.932
Hold it.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.585
If I see you in L.A. again
I don't care if you are a kid

45:41.586 --> 45:44.773
or an old lady or a kitty-Kat.
I'm going to kick your ass.

45:46.727 --> 45:49.625
Get him out of here.

45:50.608 --> 45:53.368
I hope she's worth it, Jack.

46:04.676 --> 46:07.093
Leena?

46:07.702 --> 46:10.224
That was too much.

46:12.724 --> 46:15.306
Too much what?

46:19.601 --> 46:22.122
Hey, wait a minute.

46:23.121 --> 46:24.516
Leena...

46:24.517 --> 46:27.229
I should get some
sleep, don't you think?

46:34.651 --> 46:38.043
Well, Phil. I hope you
enjoyed yourself... again.

46:44.998 --> 46:47.294
<i>If you have a favorite script...</i>

46:47.295 --> 46:49.490
Come on, Peter Gunn.

46:49.756 --> 46:53.589
<i>You too, can proudly display the art
treasures of the world in your own home.</i>

46:53.590 --> 46:56.400
<i>Imagine your private gallery
of fine reproductions.</i>

46:56.401 --> 46:58.531
<i>Blue Boy, the Mona
Lisa, The Last Supper</i>

46:58.532 --> 47:00.796
<i>and everyone's favorite,
Whistler's Mother.</i>

47:00.797 --> 47:03.367
I didn't know he had a mother.

47:03.368 --> 47:06.850
With me is Lieutenant Weisling who
heads the new skidrow task-force.

47:06.851 --> 47:08.845
Lieutenant, what's going
to happen to these men?

47:08.846 --> 47:13.221
Well Kim, they'll be taken downtown
and issued special ID cards.

47:13.222 --> 47:15.848
With the crimes rate downtown

47:16.102 --> 47:18.203
this program will enable us

47:18.204 --> 47:20.794
to keep track of the homeless

47:20.795 --> 47:23.309
and protect the innocent.

47:23.669 --> 47:27.176
As you know, I have the
complete backing of the Mayor

47:27.177 --> 47:28.866
and the City Council.

47:28.867 --> 47:31.535
And I know that by the time I'm through,

47:31.536 --> 47:35.219
the city will be safe for everyone.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.979
- Get dressed.
- What now?

47:38.980 --> 47:41.560
We're going to skidrow.

47:45.122 --> 47:46.977
This hobo roundup means one thing.

47:46.978 --> 47:49.498
Whistler knows Ashley is on skidrow.

47:49.814 --> 47:52.467
What is this?

47:52.511 --> 47:55.489
- A reload.
- That's so cool!

47:55.490 --> 47:58.714
- How did they do that?
- How far is skidrow from here?

47:59.114 --> 48:00.681
A couple of miles.

48:01.058 --> 48:03.198
Then will have to get a transit.

48:03.199 --> 48:06.821
- A what?
- I think you people call them taxis.

48:06.822 --> 48:09.470
We're out of money.

48:09.685 --> 48:12.531
Then we walk.

48:21.251 --> 48:24.469
Can you pretend that you're
not a cop, just for a minute?

48:25.238 --> 48:26.608
Where did you learn how to do this?

48:26.609 --> 48:29.323
I used to hang with some
bikers when I was fifteen.

guys. They're too out of it, its useless.

49:09.263 --> 49:11.521
Listen Leena, that's
what a cop is all about.

49:11.522 --> 49:14.586
Whether its here or three hundred
years down the line, come on.

49:20.128 --> 49:21.899
Evening citizens.

49:21.900 --> 49:24.321

49:24.638 --> 49:27.969
Who brought this glorious Angel?

49:27.970 --> 49:31.252
That we three kings may gaze upon?

49:31.253 --> 49:33.555
- This is the Christmas angel.
- Jack...

49:33.556 --> 49:35.334
Work with me.

49:35.335 --> 49:37.793
The Angel has a mission.

49:38.427 --> 49:41.446
I seek knowledge.

49:42.307 --> 49:45.844
Well, we're not called
three wise men for nothing.

49:47.183 --> 49:49.725
Do you know this guy?

49:52.747 --> 49:54.420
That's "High Ball"!

49:54.421 --> 49:56.432
Yeah, do you know where we can find him?

49:56.433 --> 49:59.174
- That depends.
- On what?

50:00.478 --> 50:03.229
Did the Angel bring
any, little... 'gifties'

50:03.230 --> 50:06.019
for three weary travelers?

50:06.020 --> 50:09.749
I don't have any gold but I have
some frankincense and some mirth.

50:09.750 --> 50:13.380
Check the old paper mill on Alameda St.

50:13.729 --> 50:16.202
- Can you find that?
- Yeah, I think so.

50:17.334 --> 50:19.910

Whistler knows about the paper mill,
they're going to sweep through the factory.

50:45.371 --> 50:47.061
We got to find Ashby first.

50:47.062 --> 50:49.471
- Ditch the bikes, I go in by foot.
- Alone?

50:49.472 --> 50:52.036
- Yeah, I don't want you getting hurt.
- I'm not afraid.

50:52.625 --> 50:54.998
Well, I am.

51:06.713 --> 51:08.788
That's it, up ahead.

51:08.789 --> 51:11.101
Now, you better stay put, Angel.

52:47.345 --> 52:49.361
This room's clean.

52:49.362 --> 52:51.714
Let's check the next wing.

53:27.430 --> 53:29.718
I hear something.

53:53.740 --> 53:55.797
Hey!

53:57.042 --> 53:59.750
Watch them lights, Trooper?

53:59.751 --> 54:02.094
Can't I get some sleep?
It's fucking Christmas.

54:02.095 --> 54:05.036
- Your name Ashby?
- I don't know.

54:06.001 --> 54:08.967
- You got some ID, buddy?
- Yeah, somewhere.

54:08.990 --> 54:11.151
Oh God, I'm going to puke!

54:12.954 --> 54:15.472
It's not him, let's go.

54:27.935 --> 54:31.402
Wait a minute, he called us "Troopers".

54:31.403 --> 54:35.511
The Lieutenant said that
Jack Deth was a Trooper.

54:47.607 --> 54:50.530
Empty! Damn!

54:51.563 --> 54:53.440
Radio Weisling. We need backup.

54:58.380 --> 54:59.946
Hold it!

55:00.744 --> 55:04.024
Get ​​your ass up against that wall.
Nice and easy.

55:06.535 --> 55:08.158
Open the coat.

55:08.158 --> 55:09.817
Open it!

55:10.756 --> 55:13.598
Toss the piece out as far as you can.

55:16.234 --> 55:19.361
Good. Do the same thing with
that fancy wrist watch.

55:19.362 --> 55:21.365
You're not going to
pull that trick again.

55:40.997 --> 55:43.531
The Lieutenant has told
us all about you, Deth.

55:44.237 --> 55:45.996
How you're trying to twist the world

55:45.997 --> 55:48.300
and make the future come
out the way you want it to.

55:48.301 --> 55:51.343
You're wrong, pal.
I'm a cop just like you.

55:51.871 --> 55:53.280
No, you're lying.

55:53.281 --> 55:55.061
You and your men have
been tranced by Whistler.

55:55.062 --> 55:57.906
You're slaves to Whistler.
Look at your skin.

55:58.129 --> 56:00.968
- Fight it, concentrate.
- No!

56:01.668 --> 56:04.965
The Lieutenant is the
finest man in the force.

56:05.514 --> 56:07.353
I pledge my life to him.

56:07.354 --> 56:10.974
My orders are shoot to kill.

56:27.848 --> 56:30.098
He was going to kill you!
I had to do it.

56:30.099 --> 56:33.078
- Yeah, you did.
- Oh, God...

56:33.769 --> 56:35.392
Don't take it so hard.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.905
He was dead the moment he
gave himself to Whistler.

56:37.906 --> 56:40.144
Look.

56:45.211 --> 56:48.774
Cheer up. You just singed
your first Trancer.

56:49.913 --> 56:52.258
Great.

56:52.507 --> 56:54.725
Come on.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.600
Okay, let's go, man.

57:01.601 --> 57:03.606
Give me that bottle!

57:03.607 --> 57:06.836
It's for you, friend.

57:07.536 --> 57:09.967
Yeah, man!

57:10.656 --> 57:13.868
Come on, let's go.

57:13.869 --> 57:15.026
One more time, friend.

57:15.824 --> 57:17.891
Let's go, one more.

57:17.892 --> 57:20.027
Here, baby. Come on.

57:20.028 --> 57:22.047
- Hit.
- Dale.

57:22.048 --> 57:25.143
Okay, right down the pipe.

57:27.114 --> 57:29.786
Okay, boy lets go.

57:31.351 --> 57:34.124
Philie, you're standing
in the strike zone.

57:34.125 --> 57:37.097
- Back off a little bit.
- You're standing in the strike zone?

57:37.098 --> 57:39.268
Stop complaining.

57:39.269 --> 57:41.866
Come on, boy!

57:41.867 --> 57:44.194
Come on!

57:44.520 --> 57:47.860
You stand up flat as fuck.
You know better than that.

57:55.396 --> 57:57.290
Come on, Hap!

57:57.291 --> 57:59.783
You got to get one more in there.

58:08.941 --> 58:11.092
That a boy!

58:30.321 --> 58:32.215
That bum better show up fast.

58:32.216 --> 58:35.657
God dammit, I lost that long
second watch back there.

58:36.358 --> 58:38.767
You mean this?

58:41.488 --> 58:44.271
Would you kiss me?

58:44.600 --> 58:46.637
I don't have time for this.

58:46.638 --> 58:49.250
I'll make the time.

59:15.576 --> 59:18.375
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:20.117 --> 59:23.101
- I'm looking for a guy named "High Ball".
- Jack.

59:26.194 --> 59:28.514
You're Hap Ashby..

59:38.538 --> 59:41.716
I haven't seen one of
these in a long time.

59:42.763 --> 59:44.389
Who are you?

59:44.390 --> 59:47.405
There's men upstairs that
want to kill you, Ashby.

59:48.139 --> 59:51.309
Me? The hell for?

59:51.310 --> 59:53.746
Police! Nobody move!

59:54.512 --> 59:57.154
I want Hap Ashby.

59:57.155 --> 01:00:00.224
I'm tired of dealing with worthless vermin,

01:00:00.225 --> 01:00:03.725
now step forward or we
will kill the lot of you.

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.890
You bums!

01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:10.268
This way, Mister!

01:00:25.192 --> 01:00:27.184
I want to ride with the lady.

01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:29.843
Over here, Ashby.

01:00:33.874 --> 01:00:35.035
Hit it!

01:00:39.486 --> 01:00:41.925
Get the cars!

01:00:54.274 --> 01:00:56.134
Can't you go any faster?

01:00:56.135 --> 01:00:58.263
Not with him onboard.
Listen, we better split up.

01:00:58.264 --> 01:00:59.249
We don't stand a chance.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:01.364
Divide and conquer
that's what we should do.

01:01:01.365 --> 01:01:04.221
- Meet us in Chinatown.
- You don't know your way!

01:01:04.222 --> 01:01:06.469
- Yeah, I do, I used to swim through here.
- What?

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.653
Hang on to the back, how you doing?

01:01:50.654 --> 01:01:53.082
Okay, coach but it's the bottom of 5th.

01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:55.089
Time for the long second.

01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:57.584
- What are you doing?
- Damn!

01:01:58.997 --> 01:02:01.041
Last call.

01:02:06.442 --> 01:02:08.356
Jesus Christ!

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.565
Sure am glad I kept my cup, coach!

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.803
Could you just get the door for me, please.

01:03:00.804 --> 01:03:03.194
The door?

01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:10.242
Merry Christmas.

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:25.668
- What the hell are we doing in Chinatown?
- You'll be safe.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:27.943
You come up stairs with me, Ashby.

01:03:31.845 --> 01:03:33.487
What's the problem, man?

01:03:33.488 --> 01:03:36.099
You got people shooting at you and shit.

01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:38.863
Where did you get my baseball card?

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.285
- You quite.
- I don't even know your name.

01:03:41.286 --> 01:03:43.588
My name is Deth. Jack Deth.

01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:45.186
Death, upstairs, yeah,
I'll get right on that.

01:03:45.187 --> 01:03:48.546
Ashby, you listen to me.
You got to trust me.

01:03:48.547 --> 01:03:50.592
"You got to trust me." That's my name.

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:53.500
Your name's Jack Deth?

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.272
That's a dumb name.

01:04:08.067 --> 01:04:11.162
What the fuck?

01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:17.051
Leena?

01:04:18.914 --> 01:04:21.614
Wait here, Hap. Leena!

01:04:37.114 --> 01:04:39.612
- Leena!
- Hi.

01:04:39.613 --> 01:04:41.381
Are you okay?

01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:45.358
Look, I know this hurts. It's just...

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.280
It's just a nick.

01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:51.441
These things usually heal pretty fast.

01:04:58.867 --> 01:05:00.786
What? What's the matter?

01:05:03.127 --> 01:05:06.188
I had a wife in Angel City. She...

01:05:06.189 --> 01:05:08.791
She volunteered for Trancer bait.

01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:12.161
I figured, okay, what could
go wrong? It's my hunt.

01:05:13.499 --> 01:05:15.257
We lost her.

01:05:17.453 --> 01:05:19.654
I don't want that to happen again.

01:05:22.177 --> 01:05:24.792
You love me.

01:05:25.072 --> 01:05:27.496
Isn't that what I just said.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:36.810
Hey, coach! You got
any mustard out here?

01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:45.457
You got any mustard, coach?

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:48.894
Why don't you make
yourself at home, slugger.

01:05:49.165 --> 01:05:52.267
Thanks, coach.

01:05:54.758 --> 01:05:56.188
What the hell is that?

01:05:57.402 --> 01:05:59.933
That's the only thing I got
left over from pro-ball.

01:05:59.934 --> 01:06:01.804
Jack, do you smell something?

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.341
Say, Hap.

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:09.101
How about a nice hot shower?

01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:11.787
Nah, I don't think so.

01:06:11.984 --> 01:06:14.150
Come on, I'll give you a hand.

01:06:14.151 --> 01:06:17.545
- Wait a minute, I know my rights.
- Yeah, so do we, pal.

01:06:23.241 --> 01:06:25.854
What the hell?

01:06:31.438 --> 01:06:33.793
Sorry, found them.

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:42.520
Sorry, pal. Here, you might
as well have this too.

01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:44.475
Sorry.

01:06:44.476 --> 01:06:45.893
Listen!

01:06:48.262 --> 01:06:50.863
Lifting that watch could have
got us killed, hop-head.

01:06:50.864 --> 01:06:53.350
We're in the heat!
If you want to stay alive,

01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:55.141
you're going to have
to play ball with me.

01:06:55.142 --> 01:06:56.448
Are you listening to me?

01:06:56.449 --> 01:06:59.530
- I'm just a bum, man.
- You are now Hap.

01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:01.177
But, I'm your fortune-teller.

01:07:01.178 --> 01:07:03.348
You're going to dry out, get a job.

01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:05.079
Meet a girl and have a kid.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.216
His descendant is going to be one the
greatest leaders in the 23rd century.

01:07:10.363 --> 01:07:12.850
And it all starts with you in the tub.

01:07:13.374 --> 01:07:16.025
Now come on, Hap!

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:18.576
You need to be hosed down.

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:21.090
What about a sponge bath with Blondie?

01:07:21.091 --> 01:07:22.172
Huh?

01:07:24.187 --> 01:07:25.278
Here.

01:07:26.899 --> 01:07:29.311
I don't think he
understood a word you said.

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:30.672
Sure, he did.

01:07:42.845 --> 01:07:44.771
Operator, get me the police.

01:07:44.772 --> 01:07:46.870
Parker Center.

01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:50.823
One sec I'll get some towels.
Who you calling?

01:07:51.494 --> 01:07:52.993
Lieutenant Weisling, please.

01:07:53.093 --> 01:07:55.625
Tell him it's Deth, he'll know.

01:07:55.997 --> 01:07:57.812
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

01:07:57.813 --> 01:08:00.458
Whistler? I want to make a deal.

01:08:00.459 --> 01:08:02.957
I'm tired of chasing you. I'm
tired of this whole business.

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:06.599
I want out. You can have Angel City
and everything else down the line.

01:08:07.719 --> 01:08:09.560
- All I want is the girl.
- Jack, don't do this.

01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:10.732
Shut up!

01:08:11.271 --> 01:08:13.776
Just give me my life with her
and you can have Hap Ashby.

01:08:13.777 --> 01:08:17.203
- Don't! Jack, please. Come on!
- Yeah.

01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:18.968
Chinatown..

01:08:19.167 --> 01:08:20.636
You'll see.

01:08:24.377 --> 01:08:25.118
Leena.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.210
Don't touch me! You'll let
that poor man be murdered?

01:08:28.211 --> 01:08:31.419
Relax. You played it just right.

01:08:32.982 --> 01:08:35.718
- It was a trick?
- Yeah, sure.

01:08:35.719 --> 01:08:39.478
I'm a cop. I'm doing my job.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:54.515
Call to him.

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:58.928
Now.

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:01.917
Jack!

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:03.526
Perfect.

01:09:05.055 --> 01:09:06.796
Merry Christmas!

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.801
Keep on sucking earth.

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:14.555
That's six shots, Whistler,
the gun is empty.

01:09:14.697 --> 01:09:15.728
No, five!

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.318
The girl is too strong,
she won't trance, Whistler.

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:23.037
No!

01:09:29.261 --> 01:09:30.812
I'm the one you want, not her.

01:09:30.813 --> 01:09:32.948
And you're the one that she'll have.

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.988
Oh yes, didn't you know?

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:38.384
Deth then marries the girl, or
would have had she lived.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.941
And now, Jack Deth...

01:09:40.942 --> 01:09:45.192
Prepare to witness your own demise.

01:10:30.079 --> 01:10:31.156
Oh Jack!

01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:05.160
Get over.

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.081
I'd like to blow you to fish food,
but I made other plans.

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:12.083
You got no flesh in Angel
City, I singed it.

01:11:12.084 --> 01:11:14.709
You're going up the line with no stops.

01:11:18.668 --> 01:11:20.080
Broken!

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.673
- Dammit!
- What?

01:11:22.674 --> 01:11:25.117
I had two vials of antidote,
one for Whistler one for me.

01:11:25.118 --> 01:11:26.889
You lose again, Jack.

01:11:26.951 --> 01:11:30.554
Only one of us can return now.

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.851
I'll see you in Hell.

01:11:33.245 --> 01:11:35.583
You wouldn't murder an innocent man?

01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:39.429
Weisling has six children.

01:11:55.996 --> 01:11:58.542
What the hell?

01:12:17.172 --> 01:12:19.605
Where am I?

01:12:20.763 --> 01:12:22.885
What happened?

01:12:22.886 --> 01:12:25.374
Ashby!

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:28.474
Help Lieutenant Weisling.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:31.544
Sure.

01:12:39.972 --> 01:12:42.151
Who is that man?

01:12:42.422 --> 01:12:44.132
Him?

01:12:45.422 --> 01:12:46.864
A fortune-teller.

01:12:57.989 --> 01:13:00.570
You can't get home now.

01:13:01.864 --> 01:13:03.787
What are you going to do?

01:13:06.305 --> 01:13:08.197
That's okay.

01:13:11.102 --> 01:13:13.581
I kind of like it here.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.019
