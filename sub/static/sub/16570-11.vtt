00:18.201 --> 00:21.102
Is this gonna be your attitude
the whole day? It is irritating.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.933
I'm not talking to you
until I get my iPod and phone back.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.007
That's not happening until you apologize.

00:26.176 --> 00:28.770
I apologized to Uncle Fritz,
and he accepted my apology.

00:28.945 --> 00:32.381
You didn't apologize to me yet,
which shouldn't be that hard to do...

00:32.549 --> 00:36.212
...considering I told you exactly
what I wanna hear.

00:39.222 --> 00:42.214
I'm sorry for drugging you
with the pot brownies I made...

00:42.392 --> 00:44.883
...and for putting Uncle Fritz
in a terrible position.

00:46.830 --> 00:50.322
- I'm not feeling it.
- Oh, my God. Forget it. I don't care.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.229
You better care. If I don't start
believing that you've developed a thought...

00:55.405 --> 00:58.806
...for anyone other than yourself,
when Grandpa comes to pick you up...

00:58.975 --> 01:00.169
...you and I will have a...
- Watch out.

01:03.713 --> 01:06.944
- Why are all these people running?
- Charlie, don't open your window.

01:07.117 --> 01:08.209
Somebody's shooting in the parking lot.

01:13.757 --> 01:16.248
- You're in the red zone.
- The red zone is for police.

01:16.426 --> 01:20.362
I am the red zone. Keep your head down.
And stay in the ca... Down.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.060
And stay in the car.

02:26.629 --> 02:28.893
Help me, please. Please help.

02:39.175 --> 02:42.269
- I'm a police officer. What's your name?
- Jake.

02:42.812 --> 02:45.610
Oh, God. I think I'm shot.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.676
- I'm bleeding.
- Okay, Jake, don't move.

02:48.852 --> 02:52.413
I want you to take this sweater
and press it against your belly. Like that.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.817
- Okay.
- Good.

02:53.990 --> 02:56.481
- Do you know who shot you?
- Uh, no. No.

02:56.659 --> 02:58.786
Was it a boy or a girl?

02:58.962 --> 03:01.089
- I think it was a boy.
- Okay.

03:03.967 --> 03:07.994
Oh, God. Please, please don't leave me.
Don't. Please, please.

03:08.171 --> 03:10.036
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Stay with me.

03:10.206 --> 03:12.868
I wanna make sure the ambulance knows
where you are, okay?

03:13.042 --> 03:15.203
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.940
Charlie. I told you to wait in the car.

03:20.116 --> 03:23.813
I didn't hear anything, so I thought I'd...
Here, I brought your bag and phone.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.750
Hey, someone needs to call my mom.

03:25.922 --> 03:28.083
Don't worry.
Someone is gonna call your mom.

03:28.258 --> 03:29.816
- Freeze.
- Don't you worry.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.724
Deputy Chief Johnson. I've got two down:
One dead and one under the car.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.029
I want a four-block perimeter
and field interview cards...

03:39.202 --> 03:42.501
...on every person that you stop.
And get that ambulance back here.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.697
- Got it.
- Lieutenant.

03:53.182 --> 03:55.343
His mother's name is Patricia Burrell.

03:55.518 --> 03:57.884
She's a flight attendant
for Royal Asian Airlines.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.715
Thank you. Officer, come with me.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.524
I'm riding with Jake.
I want you to take this young lady...

04:08.698 --> 04:11.360
...and follow the ambulance to the hospital
in my car.

04:11.534 --> 04:14.264
You wait for me in the ER.
Don't let her out of your sight.

04:14.437 --> 04:16.029
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:20.944 --> 04:24.107
Okay, I'm right here, Jake.
I'm with you the whole way.

04:34.624 --> 04:38.788
- Is my mom coming?
- Yes, she is, just as soon as possible.

04:40.096 --> 04:44.055
- Sorry about the sweater.
- Don't you worry about that.

04:44.233 --> 04:46.360
I promise I'll be here
the minute you wake up.

04:58.147 --> 04:59.444
Flynn.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.714
- Here's your keys, chief.
- Thank you.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.012
- Is he gonna make it?
- It's hard to know.

05:05.188 --> 05:06.746
Sit there and don't move.

05:07.423 --> 05:10.153
Lieutenant,
did you locate Jake's mother?

05:10.326 --> 05:11.987
We know that
she's on the way to Hanoi.

05:12.161 --> 05:14.561
We haven't been able
to, uh, get in touch with her yet.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.632
Did Jake say anything
before the doctors took him?

05:18.267 --> 05:19.928
No.

05:20.103 --> 05:22.071
Gentlemen, can we?

05:26.175 --> 05:29.508
- Did you ID the victim yet?
- Uh, yes, uh...

05:29.679 --> 05:34.514
His name is Tomas DeLeon. Age 17.

05:34.684 --> 05:37.778
Died with a backpack full of pot.

05:38.988 --> 05:41.650
- So he's a drug dealer.
- Looks like it.

05:41.824 --> 05:44.588
So that might make that boy in surgery
one of his customers.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.094
- Were they victims of a robbery?
- If it was, it didn't go very well.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.756
Tomas had a big roll of cash on him,
mostly small bills.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.128
Any other witnesses?

05:53.302 --> 05:57.204
Um, well, yeah, a couple of people said
they saw someone with a gun.

05:57.373 --> 05:58.704
Really? Who?

05:58.875 --> 06:01.901
A woman in a brown dress
with blond curly hair.

06:03.479 --> 06:05.310
- That's horrible.
- Well, not completely.

06:05.481 --> 06:09.315
One of the witnesses described you
as being in your early 30s.

06:15.525 --> 06:18.392
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Did you see where?

06:18.561 --> 06:20.529
She was right here.

06:24.934 --> 06:28.062
- Do you have change for a soda?
- Ah, I told you not to move.

06:28.237 --> 06:29.898
- I had to go to the bathroom.
- I don't care.

06:30.073 --> 06:33.668
When I say, "Stay in the car,"
I mean stay in the car. I could've shot you.

06:33.843 --> 06:37.836
- I was trying to help. How am I suppose...?
- I didn't ask for help. Don't interrupt me.

06:43.553 --> 06:45.418
I have to get to work.

06:45.588 --> 06:48.489
Since you seem to be so interested
in how this boy is doing...

06:48.658 --> 06:51.525
...you can stay here with him
when he gets out of surgery.

06:51.694 --> 06:53.855
- Call me the second he wakes up.
- Why me?

06:54.030 --> 06:55.497
I'm giving you the chance...

06:55.665 --> 06:59.897
...to show that you can care about someone
other than yourself for a few minutes.

07:00.069 --> 07:01.093
So sit here...

07:01.270 --> 07:05.036
...and think about how lucky you are
that you're out here and not in there.

07:13.382 --> 07:14.940
Flynn.

07:17.954 --> 07:22.721
Our dead boy is Tomas DeLeon,
and our eyewitness, Jake Burrell...

07:22.892 --> 07:25.190
...is in emergency surgery
and might not make it.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.056
Be ready to do this without him.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.755
- What was going on in that parking lot?
- Drugs.

07:29.932 --> 07:35.564
Obviously. All this pot was from our victim
Tomas DeLeon's backpack.

07:35.738 --> 07:39.265
Chief, if this is the start of a turf war,
you need Narcotics involved.

07:39.442 --> 07:41.706
- They know the players.
- You're right, commander.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.005
If that's what this is,
we need to be prepared.

07:44.180 --> 07:48.742
- Was the dead boy in a gang?
- No. His older brother, Oscar DeLeon, was.

07:48.918 --> 07:52.115
Served three years for distribution.
Out for two months.

07:52.288 --> 07:56.657
Well, maybe big brother was using
little brother to keep his own nose clean.

07:56.826 --> 07:59.522
Or to keep it from getting blown off
by another gang.

07:59.695 --> 08:02.459
- How many shots were fired?
- We found five 9 mm casings...

08:02.632 --> 08:04.395
...spaced about one to two feet apart.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.694
Looks like the killer
was shooting on the move.

08:06.869 --> 08:10.828
And the car our witness Jake was hiding
under, turns out it's registered to Tomas.

08:11.007 --> 08:13.475
We're towing it to the print shed.

08:14.343 --> 08:18.837
Okay. Let's do the notification
for the DeLeon family here.

08:19.015 --> 08:21.506
See if we can have his brother,
Oscar, present.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.083
- Sure.
- Maybe he can tell us...

08:23.252 --> 08:25.584
...who would want his little brother dead.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.791
That's not Tomas' backpack.
I never saw it before.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.861
- You see it before?
- No.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.697
Is this your little brother's backpack?

08:40.135 --> 08:42.604
- Oscar?
- Tomas is a good boy.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.364
Never in any trouble.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.364
I see.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.567
When was the last time
you saw your son?

08:48.744 --> 08:50.336
This morning around 9.

08:50.513 --> 08:54.005
He had breakfast, and he was worried
about being late for his job.

08:54.183 --> 08:56.447
Really? And where is his job?

08:57.220 --> 09:01.554
It's in a coffee place
somewhere in Hollywood. I'm not sure.

09:01.724 --> 09:04.454
I'm sorry, you arrested the wrong boy.

09:07.563 --> 09:11.556
Tell me, how does a boy
working in a coffee shop...

09:11.734 --> 09:15.363
...make $800 in tips before noon?

09:17.840 --> 09:22.903
Uh, we told you that this is not, um...
It's not his backpack.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.849
Can you identify his car?

09:30.920 --> 09:33.286
Yes, that's his.

09:33.456 --> 09:36.755
Hmm, well, when Tomas
bought his new car last month...

09:36.926 --> 09:39.520
...somehow he paid for it in cash.

09:40.029 --> 09:42.259
- No. He said he got a loan.
- No.

09:42.431 --> 09:46.424
He was selling drugs.
And I wanna know who he was working for.

09:46.602 --> 09:50.595
- Any ideas, Oscar?
- I got no ideas.

09:55.411 --> 09:57.106
All right, then.

09:57.813 --> 10:00.304
Mr. And Mrs. DeLeon, Oscar...

10:00.483 --> 10:06.285
...it is my sad duty to inform you
that your son Tomas was shot and killed...

10:06.455 --> 10:08.855
...in a parking lot
where he was selling drugs.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.016
You should've been the one
who was dead!

10:11.193 --> 10:13.957
- You got him killed!
- I wasn't even there!

10:14.130 --> 10:16.189
- You killed him!
- Okay. All right. Whoa! Easy.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.856
- You should've never gotten out of jail!
- Easy. Hey.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.799
I wish they'd never let you go!

10:21.971 --> 10:24.405
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

10:25.207 --> 10:29.906
Let him go, detective.
We have nothing to hold him on.

10:32.415 --> 10:33.780
At the moment.

10:42.124 --> 10:44.217
I had to leave her at the hospital.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.794
I thought we agreed
Charlie needs constant supervision.

10:48.331 --> 10:50.891
Look, I promised my witness
he wouldn't be alone.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.898
Charlie seemed to show interest in him.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.596
So I thought, why not give her
the responsibility of looking in on the boy?

10:56.772 --> 11:00.572
- It might help her to grow up a little.
- She doesn't deal with death all the time.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.870
She just saw two kids
bleeding on the pavement.

11:03.045 --> 11:06.572
Did you stop and think that leaving her
in an emergency room by herself...

11:06.749 --> 11:08.307
...might not be the best idea?

11:08.484 --> 11:11.647
No. I thought she'd get to see what
happens when a drug deal goes wrong.

11:11.821 --> 11:14.312
So this is your own
little scared-straight program?

11:14.490 --> 11:17.152
Why not lock her in county for the night?

11:18.127 --> 11:21.392
I should've heard from her by now.
I'm gonna call her...

11:21.564 --> 11:23.259
...tell her to meet us downstairs.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.794
Ooh!

11:28.971 --> 11:30.563
Oh, no.

11:36.746 --> 11:38.577
You left her at the hospital
without her phone.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.679
We agreed after she apologized to me,
you'd give it back.

11:42.852 --> 11:45.116
Well, she didn't apologize to me.

11:45.287 --> 11:50.657
Properly. I mean, she started to,
but then she was, I don't know, pouting.

11:56.599 --> 11:59.534
Well, he's through surgery
and already out of anesthesia...

11:59.702 --> 12:02.364
...and talking to his sister,
so that's good.

12:02.538 --> 12:05.006
- His sister?
- Yeah. She's been glued to him.

12:05.174 --> 12:06.334
Oh, um...

12:06.509 --> 12:09.967
- Okay, uh, let me see my face.
- Okay.

12:14.216 --> 12:18.118
- Oh, God, my hair.
- Don't worry. You look great.

12:18.454 --> 12:22.447
- Really?
- Okay, that's enough for now.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.183
He needs to rest.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.853
Uh, be right there.

12:27.029 --> 12:28.189
I have to go.

12:28.364 --> 12:33.700
I have, um, other, uh, patients to see.
So nice to meet you.

12:33.869 --> 12:35.837
Yeah. Will you come back?

12:36.739 --> 12:41.733
Of course. As soon as I can.
I just have to check the schedule.

12:43.145 --> 12:44.476
Bye.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.149
Jake.

12:47.316 --> 12:49.375
It's good to see you up and, um...

12:50.453 --> 12:52.580
Uh, excuse me just a second.
Just one moment.

12:55.825 --> 12:58.760
- "I have to check the schedule"?
- He thinks I'm a volunteer.

12:58.928 --> 13:02.227
- The nurses think you're his sister?
- They only allow family members in the ICU.

13:02.398 --> 13:04.559
Thank God I heard you use
his mom's name.

13:04.733 --> 13:08.464
Obviously, Jake knows I'm not his sister,
so I told him I was a youth volunteer.

13:08.637 --> 13:10.332
It was easier than explaining
you're my aunt.

13:12.007 --> 13:14.202
You two are so related.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.835
I told you to call me
the second he woke up.

13:17.012 --> 13:19.378
You wouldn't give me back my phone.

13:20.950 --> 13:23.111
Did he say anything
about what happened?

13:23.285 --> 13:26.277
No. I was trying to make him feel better.
I'm not a narc.

13:26.455 --> 13:30.255
Charlie here has fulfilled her responsibilities
pretty well, wouldn't you say?

13:30.426 --> 13:33.759
Yes, I would. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Charlie.

13:33.929 --> 13:37.262
- I promised him a playlist.
- If that's designed to get your iPod back...

13:37.433 --> 13:40.129
...it's not working.
- You really wanna punish her...

13:40.302 --> 13:45.296
...what do you say I take this volunteer
down to the cafeteria? The pizza's horrible.

13:45.474 --> 13:47.135
Thank you, Uncle Fritz.

13:53.949 --> 13:56.213
There was this, uh, flash.

13:58.187 --> 14:01.156
And his head just went...

14:03.492 --> 14:06.655
- I hit the ground.
- So he was shot first.

14:07.363 --> 14:08.830
Did you see the person shooting?

14:10.266 --> 14:14.760
No. He was behind the other guy
that got shot.

14:15.237 --> 14:18.400
All I did was get under the car.

14:18.574 --> 14:22.101
Did you know Tomas DeLeon,
the guy who was killed?

14:23.779 --> 14:25.974
Or what he was doing
in that parking lot?

14:29.919 --> 14:32.012
Jake, we didn't find any drugs on you...

14:32.421 --> 14:34.821
...and I have no evidence
that you were buying.

14:34.990 --> 14:37.254
You've got enough trouble.
I'm only interested...

14:37.426 --> 14:41.089
...in the person who was shooting.
Can you describe him for me?

14:42.331 --> 14:45.459
I never saw his face.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.296
The shooting started,
and I went under the car...

14:48.470 --> 14:51.496
...and then the shooting stopped.

14:52.408 --> 14:57.345
And when I looked, I just...
I saw someone walking away.

14:57.513 --> 15:02.007
And the next person I saw was you.

15:03.419 --> 15:08.322
Please don't tell my mom
why I was there.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.288
Her only worry is that you get better,
believe me.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.360
You talked to her?

15:13.862 --> 15:15.989
- Yes, I did.
- Is she coming?

15:16.165 --> 15:19.464
She is coming
just as fast as that plane can fly.

15:19.635 --> 15:22.570
I'm sure she told the captain
to step on it.

15:30.279 --> 15:32.907
You're gonna be okay. Okay?

15:35.985 --> 15:39.352
We've got him pumped full of antibiotics.
Large intestine was perforated.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.920
So infection is a big concern.

15:41.490 --> 15:44.425
If he makes it through tomorrow night,
he's got a chance.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.853
- How many bullets did you recover?
- No complete bullets, only fragments.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.261
- Fragments?
- Shrapnel, basically.

15:51.433 --> 15:52.900
He had multiple entrance wounds.

15:53.068 --> 15:56.162
The bullets hit something and shattered
before entering his body.

15:56.338 --> 15:58.863
Surgically speaking,
that's a little more challenging.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.441
Yes, I understand.
Thank you. Thank you.

16:01.610 --> 16:02.634
Lieutenant Tao?

16:02.811 --> 16:05.109
<i>I think we can explain the shrapnel.</i>

16:05.280 --> 16:08.716
These chalk lines represent the parking
space where Jake Burrell was shot.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.786
We went back and did lead wipes
on some chips in the pavement...

16:12.955 --> 16:15.219
...and found three bullet impact points.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.552
That's three bullets.
I remember five casings.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.251
- Let's do a count.
- Lord.

16:20.429 --> 16:24.229
All right. Uh, the coroner found one bullet
in the dead boy.

16:24.400 --> 16:30.964
Jake dives under the SUV,
and the shooter fires bullets two and three...

16:31.140 --> 16:32.368
Pow, pow!

16:32.541 --> 16:34.338
...which hit here and here.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.341
- And bullet four...
- Pow.

16:36.512 --> 16:37.979
...which hits here, further up.

16:38.147 --> 16:41.310
All strike the pavement,
creating shrapnel...

16:41.483 --> 16:44.714
...as Jake is backing up,
striking him in the abdomen.

16:46.488 --> 16:50.151
To here, where his blood pools.

16:50.325 --> 16:53.488
At which point, the shooter lowers himself
for a better angle...

16:54.296 --> 16:55.786
...aiming for a headshot.

16:55.964 --> 16:59.661
However, the bullet
does not hit the pavement...

16:59.835 --> 17:04.067
...does not strike Jake.
It hits the gas tank.

17:05.574 --> 17:07.804
Oh, I sense a big finish coming up.

17:07.976 --> 17:14.211
It lands in a brick of weed...

17:14.383 --> 17:18.479
...packed inside this half
of this fake gas tank.

17:19.788 --> 17:23.690
Well, if this was all about drugs,
and his SUV was loaded with marijuana...

17:23.858 --> 17:25.849
...why didn't they just drive away with it?

17:26.028 --> 17:29.191
Right. And what decent gangster
leaves $800 behind?

17:29.832 --> 17:33.324
You know, you could've spared me
this dog-and-pony show...

17:33.502 --> 17:37.336
...and just told me out-front
that the shooter fired once at DeLeon...

17:37.506 --> 17:39.872
...and four times at Jake Burrell.

17:40.042 --> 17:44.069
- Chief.
- I wanted to give you the full picture.

17:45.347 --> 17:48.908
Uh, chief, we need to go back
to the hospital.

17:49.084 --> 17:53.680
No, no, no.
We think Jake was the target all along.

18:00.796 --> 18:03.697
Buzz, do you think you could place
a camera and a microphone...

18:03.866 --> 18:05.834
...in an ICU room without being noticed?

18:06.001 --> 18:08.663
Sure. I've got some new wireless units
that are small...

18:08.837 --> 18:12.364
...and I could probably put them
on an IV stand without anyone notic...

18:12.541 --> 18:16.341
Pack up your away kit, and be ready to go
in five minutes. Thank you.

18:17.479 --> 18:21.540
Sergeant, I want clearance from the hospital
to put a video feed in Jake Burrell's room.

18:21.717 --> 18:22.775
They won't like that.

18:22.951 --> 18:25.078
- Tell them we're afraid for his safety.
- Chief.

18:25.254 --> 18:28.382
- You gonna interview the boy again?
- I don't think so, lieutenant.

18:28.557 --> 18:30.957
You said you promised Jake some music?

18:31.560 --> 18:34.358
- Yeah.
- He's all alone.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.760
I think it would be good for him.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.963
What about my phone?

18:40.435 --> 18:41.697
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

18:58.587 --> 19:01.215
- That's, uh... That's cool.
- Really?

19:02.591 --> 19:04.115
Well, it's kind of girly.

19:04.293 --> 19:07.751
<i>Yeah, you can't
really dance to it, I guess.</i>

19:12.067 --> 19:16.094
- Hey, how long can you stay today?
- A while. Why?

19:16.271 --> 19:17.533
Oh, um...

19:17.706 --> 19:22.075
My mom doesn't get in till tomorrow,
so I'm a little on my own.

19:23.846 --> 19:27.338
<i>- I'll try and stay, then.
- Thanks.</i>

19:28.417 --> 19:31.614
- Oh, my God.
- I've made up my mind.

19:31.787 --> 19:33.687
I'm gonna ask Lauren to marry me.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.187
<i>They gave her the phone in the airport...</i>

19:36.358 --> 19:38.019
I'm going to ask her.

19:38.193 --> 19:39.285
<i>So...</i>

19:40.062 --> 19:42.087
<i>...I think that she...</i>

19:42.798 --> 19:44.095
<i>...might be mad at me.</i>

19:45.000 --> 19:49.027
<i>She'll get over it when
she sees you. You'll be better tomorrow.</i>

19:49.471 --> 19:51.701
I hope she doesn't find out
I was buying pot.

19:52.808 --> 19:56.642
What is it with parents and pot?
It's like none of them ever tried it.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.046
<i>I don't think pot's that big of a deal.</i>

20:01.383 --> 20:02.509
Are you okay?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.814
Yeah, um...

20:07.856 --> 20:09.517
It just kind of hurts a little bit.

20:12.995 --> 20:15.964
- Hey, look, if you have other patients...
- I don't.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.733
I mean, it's slow today, so...

20:23.505 --> 20:25.405
Well, what about, um?

20:27.542 --> 20:31.137
Do you, like,
do this volunteer thing, uh, alone...

20:31.313 --> 20:36.148
...or does your boyfriend
do it with you sometimes?

20:36.318 --> 20:39.378
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
We broke up a few months ago.

20:39.554 --> 20:42.352
Okay, yeah, same here.

20:43.692 --> 20:46.889
- Actually, you know, I got dumped.
- Why?

20:47.062 --> 20:48.495
Uh...

20:50.132 --> 20:51.599
It was intense, you know?

20:52.401 --> 20:54.596
Like, at first...

20:55.270 --> 20:59.070
...we weren't, you know,
uh, hooking up a lot.

20:59.241 --> 21:03.940
- Then once we did, it was like...
- It was like you had to do it all the time?

21:04.112 --> 21:05.136
Yeah.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.678
With my boyfriend,
it was, like, every day, everywhere.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.512
Like,
"What about your parents' bedroom?"

21:15.290 --> 21:16.450
<i>Um...</i>

21:16.625 --> 21:20.857
<i>- Your parents' bedroom? Why?
- I don't know.</i>

21:21.697 --> 21:25.098
I guess it just sort of became
more about him than us...

21:25.267 --> 21:26.859
...and then it's hard to go back.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.229
No.

21:30.672 --> 21:32.196
I guess with the right person...

21:32.374 --> 21:34.467
...it could be different.
- Oh, totally. Totally.

21:36.244 --> 21:37.268
Yeah, I don't know.

21:40.649 --> 21:42.310
I...

21:42.484 --> 21:45.976
I may, uh, never even find out.

21:47.189 --> 21:51.853
Uh, Vanessa is my girlfriend's name, uh...

21:53.862 --> 21:56.660
- She got, uh, pregnant.
- Oh, my God.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.823
<i>Yeah, so I'm going to be a father.</i>

21:59.001 --> 22:01.060
<i>My God. She dumped you?</i>

22:01.236 --> 22:07.266
I told her, like, we could get married,
um, or, you know, I'd help her.

22:08.944 --> 22:12.380
That we could find a way
to take care of the kid...

22:12.547 --> 22:17.985
...so it wouldn't grow up
without a father...

22:18.687 --> 22:20.450
...like I did.

22:22.524 --> 22:26.483
But Vanessa, she told me
she never wanted to see me again.

22:26.661 --> 22:28.390
Why?

22:29.231 --> 22:31.665
She didn't know what to say to her dad.

22:33.568 --> 22:37.937
She kept wanting to, like,
hide everything that was going on.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.733
But she started to show, I guess...

22:39.908 --> 22:43.435
...because a couple weeks ago,
I got a phone call from her father...

22:43.612 --> 22:46.945
...saying that if he ever saw me
hanging around his daughter again...

22:47.115 --> 22:48.173
...that he'd kill me.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.947
<i>So I guess I did something wrong.</i>

22:52.120 --> 22:55.385
<i>Yeah, I messed up a lot this year.</i>

22:55.557 --> 22:57.218
Stop there, Buzz.

22:58.760 --> 22:59.886
All right, ahem.

23:00.062 --> 23:03.828
Narcotics has given you a list
of Oscar DeLeon's enemies.

23:03.999 --> 23:07.628
- The victim was dealing drugs.
- Yeah. What happened to the drugs?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.566
And she wants to throw all that out...

23:09.738 --> 23:11.228
...for teen pregnancy.
- Why?

23:11.406 --> 23:14.500
The shooter only hit Tomas once.
He shot at Jake four times.

23:14.676 --> 23:17.907
This pregnant girlfriend could be
a much stronger motive than the pot.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.913
Hmm, that's too bad, then,
because even if Jake was the target...

23:21.083 --> 23:23.381
...you had no permission
to make this recording.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.952
This girl is my niece,
and she's a witness.

23:26.121 --> 23:29.750
I had every right to record her
for her own protection.

23:29.925 --> 23:31.256
Are you her legal guardian?

23:31.426 --> 23:35.089
- Well, no, but...
- Then you cannot act on her behalf.

23:35.263 --> 23:38.391
Anything you use from this interview
would be fruit of the poisonous tree.

23:40.202 --> 23:43.933
Okay, fine. If I can't use this DVD,
I'll use what's on it.

23:44.106 --> 23:47.075
But you'll have to get the information
from some other source.

23:47.242 --> 23:49.437
I have a great one. Pardon me.

23:52.948 --> 23:55.644
- You couldn't have liked that.
- I didn't. But the pizza...

23:55.817 --> 23:58.809
- It was too mushy.
- It was mushy, exactly.

23:58.987 --> 24:00.818
- This is fantastic. Oh, my God.
- Hello.

24:00.989 --> 24:02.388
Oh, hey, honey. There you are.

24:02.557 --> 24:06.152
Hey, listen, we were gonna wait for you,
but it's completely my fault.

24:06.328 --> 24:08.455
Look. Swiss steak.

24:08.630 --> 24:11.599
Oh! That's so nice.

24:11.766 --> 24:15.634
- Charlie made dinner again.
- Oh, well, thank you, Charlie.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.903
Here. You gotta taste some.

24:19.074 --> 24:20.598
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

24:20.775 --> 24:23.903
You gotta have some of these potatoes.
They're amazing.

24:24.946 --> 24:29.315
I think it was good for Jake to spend
all that time with you today, don't you?

24:29.851 --> 24:30.943
I guess.

24:32.654 --> 24:34.781
I'm sure he enjoyed the music.

24:34.956 --> 24:38.915
And I imagine he told you
more about his life and things like that.

24:45.133 --> 24:46.896
Because I'm worried about him.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.102
- Jake.
- Why?

24:51.606 --> 24:55.337
Uh, I have reason to believe
that his life is in danger.

24:55.510 --> 24:57.171
Seemed like he was getting better.

24:57.345 --> 25:00.644
I'm not talking about the injuries.
I'm saying I no longer believe...

25:00.815 --> 25:03.249
...that Jake was just a witness.

25:03.418 --> 25:07.354
- I think he was the principal target.
- Really? Why are we talking about that?

25:07.522 --> 25:10.958
Because of the physical evidence.
Which is why, Charlie...

25:12.460 --> 25:14.519
...if Jake said anything about his life...

25:14.696 --> 25:18.530
...that might be a reason
for someone to want to hurt him...

25:18.700 --> 25:20.292
He didn't.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.434
No?

25:24.506 --> 25:27.134
- Nothing at all?
- Nope.

25:28.977 --> 25:30.968
What about his girlfriend, Vanessa?

25:31.913 --> 25:33.778
How did you know about...?

25:35.016 --> 25:38.679
- You spied on me, didn't you?
- No. I taped you.

25:38.853 --> 25:41.447
Brenda, you can't put Charlie
in the middle of this.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.887
She's been in the middle
from the very beginning.

25:45.694 --> 25:49.824
Look, if you don't want to repeat
your conversation with Jake...

25:49.998 --> 25:53.900
...this is a prepared statement
where you confirm...

25:54.069 --> 25:59.701
...that Jake told you about
getting his girlfriend, Vanessa, pregnant.

26:00.242 --> 26:04.702
- And you are going to sign it.
- No. I'm not signing anything.

26:05.247 --> 26:09.047
Okay. This is a DVD recording of everything
you said in that hospital room:

26:09.217 --> 26:13.210
About the pot, about what you did in
your parents' bedroom with your boyfriend.

26:13.388 --> 26:17.119
- Oh, my God.
- It's all going directly to your address.

26:17.292 --> 26:20.159
- You wouldn't do that.
- I'm trying to protect this boy's life.

26:20.328 --> 26:23.354
She's trying to protect his secrets.
Which is more important?

26:23.531 --> 26:26.261
You are the most horrible person
I have ever met.

26:27.302 --> 26:29.099
Tell the world that.

26:29.537 --> 26:31.437
Sign the paper, get your cell phone back.

26:31.606 --> 26:34.507
Then you can call everyone
and tell them what a monster I am...

26:34.676 --> 26:37.736
...for trying to stop someone
from killing Jake.

26:38.413 --> 26:42.440
Or I gift-wrap this DVD
and send it to your parents. Your choice.

26:50.225 --> 26:51.453
Recording me.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.051
I'm only doing this to protect Jake.

26:55.230 --> 26:58.631
No one believes that, including you.

27:05.407 --> 27:07.375
Including me.

27:07.542 --> 27:11.876
- I had to do this to legally close my case.
- And this was the only way to do that?

27:19.654 --> 27:21.519
I didn't lie to her.

27:29.531 --> 27:32.227
Aunt Brenda, quick,
I have to go to the hospital right now.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.425
- Charlie. Wait, wait. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

27:34.602 --> 27:38.595
I called Jake, and I told him everything
about who I am and how you spied on us.

27:38.773 --> 27:40.673
- Slow down. Slow down.
- What did you do? Hush, hush, hush.

27:40.842 --> 27:43.504
- What did you do?
- I called Jake, and he sounded awful.

27:43.678 --> 27:47.170
I... He had this really bad fever,
and the nurses made him get off the phone.

27:47.349 --> 27:49.112
- Okay.
- I'm going to get my clothes on.

27:49.284 --> 27:51.252
- No, Charlie.
- It'll only take a second.

27:51.419 --> 27:54.445
- Charlie. Wait. You're gonna stay here.
- I told him I was coming.

27:54.622 --> 27:57.853
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I told him everything that you did.

27:58.026 --> 28:00.859
- You shouldn't have done that.
- You have to let me see him.

28:01.029 --> 28:03.361
- Look, Charlie... Where is my purse?
- Calm down.

28:03.531 --> 28:06.091
I'll find your purse. I'll find your purse.
Stay here.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.700
You said yourself
that I'm in the middle of this.

28:10.872 --> 28:15.241
Charlie, I promise you,
I will do everything I can to help this boy.

28:15.410 --> 28:16.809
She's telling you the truth.

28:16.978 --> 28:21.540
- What's gonna happen to him?
- As soon as I find out, I will call you.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.548
Thank you.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.154
Drive carefully, all right?

28:34.963 --> 28:35.987
What now?

28:37.432 --> 28:39.093
Now I wait up with you.

28:41.302 --> 28:45.796
Doctor, um, I'm sorry.
I just need to know if Jake can handle...

28:45.974 --> 28:49.239
...being interviewed at the moment.
- We got him maxed out on morphine.

28:49.411 --> 28:50.503
So he'll be in and out.

28:50.678 --> 28:53.738
- Do you know if he spoke to his mother yet?
- Half an hour ago.

28:53.915 --> 28:58.249
She's on a plane coming in from Honolulu,
but she's still about three hours away.

28:58.420 --> 29:00.149
He's never gonna last that long.

29:05.427 --> 29:06.553
Chief, chief.

29:06.728 --> 29:07.922
Ahem, um...

29:08.096 --> 29:10.087
We don't technically need it...

29:10.265 --> 29:13.757
...but considering that, uh, we taped him
without his permission yesterday...

29:13.935 --> 29:16.301
All right. I'll ask.

29:16.471 --> 29:17.665
Okay.

29:27.348 --> 29:28.975
Jake?

29:30.084 --> 29:34.612
Mom. Mom. Mom, you made it.

29:35.423 --> 29:38.950
No, no, Jake.
It's me, Brenda, from the police.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.956
But your mom's coming.
She'll be here any minute.

29:47.769 --> 29:49.430
Is?

29:49.604 --> 29:51.629
Is Charlie here?

29:52.407 --> 29:55.137
Uh, no. No.

29:55.310 --> 29:58.404
But she told me to tell you
that she's thinking about you.

30:00.014 --> 30:04.474
Now, Jake, I'm sorry,
but I have to record our conversation.

30:04.986 --> 30:07.614
- All right, then?
- You're asking me this time?

30:08.223 --> 30:11.784
- Yes, I am. I'm sorry about that.
- That's okay.

30:14.028 --> 30:16.690
Now, I'm gonna keep this short...

30:16.865 --> 30:18.355
...but I wanna ask you again...

30:18.533 --> 30:21.331
...do you remember anything else
about the shooting?

30:23.571 --> 30:24.629
No. No.

30:24.806 --> 30:29.539
You said that you saw someone leaving
and that it was a boy and not a girl.

30:29.711 --> 30:31.679
How did you know that?

30:34.282 --> 30:35.681
I, um...

30:37.886 --> 30:40.514
I saw his feet...

30:41.089 --> 30:43.080
...as he was running away.

30:44.192 --> 30:48.094
- His, uh, hiking boots.
- Mm-hm.

30:48.730 --> 30:49.924
Tan.

30:50.298 --> 30:52.858
Tan hiking boots. That's good.
That's very, very good.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.862
Did you talk to my mom?

30:58.306 --> 30:59.637
I did. I did.

31:00.608 --> 31:04.374
And she told me to tell you
that she loves you very, very much.

31:06.047 --> 31:07.844
She knows more than you realize.

31:09.551 --> 31:14.853
She knows all about the problem
that you had with your...

31:15.690 --> 31:20.024
...girlfriend. What's her name?
Uh, Vanessa? Vanessa?

31:20.194 --> 31:24.221
- Almassian.
- Vanessa Almassian, right.

31:24.399 --> 31:28.961
Well, she knows all about that,
and she doesn't care at all.

31:29.404 --> 31:30.894
She loves you just the same.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.967
So there is nothing to worry about.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.135
That's... That's good.

31:51.926 --> 31:54.224
Yeah, good morning, sergeant.

31:54.862 --> 31:58.855
Well, it's 4:14 a.m., to be exact.

31:59.033 --> 32:00.557
Yeah.

32:00.735 --> 32:05.604
I, uh, want you to look up a name.
Vanessa Almassian.

32:06.107 --> 32:07.335
I don't know.

32:07.508 --> 32:11.911
Probably A-L-M-A-S-l-A-N.
Maybe two S's.

32:12.747 --> 32:15.716
Yes, sergeant, now.

32:15.883 --> 32:17.908
Uh-huh.

32:41.209 --> 32:45.373
- Mom. Mommy. Mama. Mom.
- No...

32:48.583 --> 32:50.278
Yes, Jake, what is it?

32:51.152 --> 32:53.177
- You made it.
- Yes, I made it.

32:53.354 --> 32:55.481
I knew you would make it.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.786
Mommy...

32:59.827 --> 33:02.694
...I'm so sorry.

33:02.864 --> 33:04.661
No.

33:04.832 --> 33:06.732
Don't be sorry.

33:07.669 --> 33:09.000
I love you no matter what.

33:10.171 --> 33:13.004
So much... So much trouble, though.

33:13.174 --> 33:14.607
No, no, no.

33:14.776 --> 33:16.869
No trouble at all.

33:18.246 --> 33:22.979
- You sure?
- I'm positive. Positive.

34:04.859 --> 34:07.054
No, no, no.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.884
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.460
I spoke with Sergeant Gabriel.

34:41.629 --> 34:44.188
He called back with a hit
on the name Almassian.

34:44.364 --> 34:45.764
Really? From where?

34:45.933 --> 34:48.527
From an interview card
from the crime scene.

34:48.703 --> 34:51.467
There was actually somebody there
with that last name.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.437
We've got an address,
and they're getting a search warrant.

34:54.609 --> 34:58.340
- Why don't you sit down and take it easy?
- No, no, no. I have to go downstairs...

34:58.513 --> 35:00.777
...and wait for Jake's mother.
- I can do that.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.615
I can do that.

35:05.286 --> 35:08.449
So sit. Catch your breath.

35:09.690 --> 35:12.352
Flynn's gonna pick you up
as soon as they get the warrant.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.017
Okay.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.692
- Oh, I'm fine, really.
- Take it.

35:23.905 --> 35:25.304
You never know.

35:45.359 --> 35:47.122
Do we know if the Almassians are home?

35:47.295 --> 35:49.763
Well, the father's due at work
in about, uh, an hour.

35:49.931 --> 35:52.399
Best guess
is the son and daughter are still inside.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.694
Here's the, uh, interview card
from the crime scene.

35:54.869 --> 35:58.464
Okay. Thank you. Make sure that
all the exits are covered while I'm inside.

35:58.639 --> 36:00.504
We got it, chief.

36:06.547 --> 36:08.811
Would you please
stay out of sight for the moment?

36:08.983 --> 36:12.282
Let's see how many answers I can get
before I invite y'all inside.

36:16.390 --> 36:17.823
Mr. Almassian?

36:17.992 --> 36:19.619
- Yes?
- I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson...

36:19.794 --> 36:22.194
...of the L.A.P.D.
I need to ask you some questions.

36:22.363 --> 36:26.129
- I'm on my way to work.
- Do you know a Jake Burrell?

36:27.969 --> 36:29.436
You need to talk to my daughter.

36:33.774 --> 36:37.676
- Vanessa, this is... I'm sorry?
- Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson...

36:37.845 --> 36:40.313
...the L.A.P.D.
- She wants to know about Jake.

36:40.481 --> 36:43.450
- So, what happened? He rape another girl?
- Dad.

36:43.618 --> 36:48.453
I told you we should call the cops.
Now look, he's done it again.

36:49.257 --> 36:52.658
Now, this is a serious matter, Vanessa.
I expect a serious answer.

36:52.827 --> 36:54.021
Did Jake rape you?

36:55.696 --> 36:58.563
Don't look at him. Look at me.
Did he rape you?

36:58.733 --> 37:01.998
Tell her what you told me
and your brother.

37:05.273 --> 37:07.400
I see you're pregnant.

37:07.575 --> 37:09.839
- Yeah.
- Is Jake Burrell the father?

37:10.978 --> 37:12.570
- Yeah.
- Tell her what happened.

37:12.747 --> 37:15.272
Go ahead, Vanessa.
Tell me what happened.

37:15.449 --> 37:17.007
No.

37:17.385 --> 37:20.582
She would rather bring shame
to her whole family.

37:23.391 --> 37:27.020
- Mr. Almassian, do you own a gun?
- Yeah. What's that got to do with anything?

37:27.194 --> 37:29.754
Where is it? Where is it?

37:29.931 --> 37:32.627
It's in the top drawer
of that table by the front door.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.428
I think you should tell me
what's going on.

37:38.205 --> 37:39.763
Okay.

37:41.442 --> 37:43.273
We have a warrant to search your house.

37:43.444 --> 37:46.004
- You have a warrant?
- Here's what you do. You cooperate.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.774
Understand? You cooperate.
You think you're ashamed now?

37:48.950 --> 37:52.750
Wait till I take you and your daughter to jail
in front of the neighbors.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.582
- Just give me a reason.
- Chief.

37:57.224 --> 37:59.954
Is there anyone else in the house
besides the two of you?

38:00.127 --> 38:02.618
My son, Alex. He's sleeping.

38:02.797 --> 38:06.597
Sir, I think you and your daughter
should grab a chair and stay seated.

38:11.739 --> 38:14.469
Mr. Almassian, where were you
at 9:00 yesterday morning?

38:14.909 --> 38:17.935
- I was at work. Call my boss.
- And your daughter?

38:18.112 --> 38:19.807
- She was here.
- What about your son?

38:19.981 --> 38:22.848
- He was here too.
- Not according to this field interview card.

38:23.017 --> 38:26.009
An officer stopped your son yesterday
two blocks...

38:26.187 --> 38:29.645
...from where a young man was killed,
and Jake Burrell was fatally wounded.

38:29.824 --> 38:31.815
- What?
- Jake died this morning...

38:31.993 --> 38:33.654
...from gunshot wounds.
- Chief.

38:33.828 --> 38:36.763
Look what I found
in one of the bedrooms.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.766
Mr. Almassian, where is your son?
Where is he?

38:42.937 --> 38:45.405
Hey! Hey! Out front! He's running away!

38:47.775 --> 38:49.265
Hey! Get on the ground!

38:50.678 --> 38:52.111
Get on the ground!

38:53.347 --> 38:55.713
- Leave him alone. What's he done?
- Stay back.

38:55.883 --> 38:58.852
- What's happening to Alex?
- We're arresting Alex for murder.

38:59.020 --> 39:01.147
What? This is all your fault.

39:01.322 --> 39:05.588
- What do you mean? What did I do?
- You're the one who got him so mad.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.854
- But Jake raped you.
- No, he didn't!

39:09.663 --> 39:10.687
He didn't.

39:11.465 --> 39:12.523
You called me a whore.

39:12.700 --> 39:15.965
- What was I supposed to say?
- How about the truth?

39:16.137 --> 39:19.004
If you told the truth from the beginning,
Jake would be alive.

39:19.173 --> 39:21.437
It's over, chief. It's over.

39:22.643 --> 39:27.546
No, it isn't.
I still have a notification to do.

39:31.419 --> 39:33.979
Come on. Get up.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.058
- Is that her?
- I think it is.

39:51.539 --> 39:54.440
You told me you were gonna call.
Why didn't you call?

39:54.842 --> 39:56.332
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:56.944 --> 40:01.176
Things got very busy,
and, um, I ended up making an arrest.

40:01.715 --> 40:05.515
- Oh, so you found the guy who shot Jake?
- I did. I did. Thanks to Charlie.

40:08.923 --> 40:13.690
I wanna tell you that because of your help
and the way that you took care of Jake...

40:13.861 --> 40:15.795
...we arrested the killer today.

40:15.963 --> 40:17.396
Really?

40:18.032 --> 40:19.431
Really.

40:24.572 --> 40:26.039
But...

40:28.109 --> 40:29.201
What happened to Jake?

40:34.748 --> 40:37.842
In gunshot wounds, there's always...

40:39.487 --> 40:42.149
There's always a serious chance
of infection.

40:42.323 --> 40:44.188
Are you saying he died?

40:46.127 --> 40:48.061
Yes, he did.

40:48.896 --> 40:52.297
Charlie, I'm so sorry
that I put you in such a terrible position.

40:52.466 --> 40:54.331
- I am so...
- I should've been there.

40:57.071 --> 41:01.098
- There was nothing you could've done.
- I could've said goodbye.

41:01.275 --> 41:04.733
- Why didn't you let me say goodbye?
- Oh, Charlie.

41:04.912 --> 41:08.678
- You kept me here when he was dying.
- You have every right to be angry.

41:08.849 --> 41:11.977
- You didn't even give me a chance.
- I have not treated you properly.

41:12.153 --> 41:16.180
Well, let me... Let me answer you.
Let me answer you.

41:18.893 --> 41:21.657
Look, Jake, he was in very bad shape...

41:21.829 --> 41:24.730
...and he had a very limited
amount of time to talk.

41:24.899 --> 41:29.359
So I had to make a decision
between finding out who killed him...

41:29.537 --> 41:34.065
...and letting you say goodbye.
And I chose to find out who killed him.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.941
Did I make the right choice?

41:46.720 --> 41:48.620
He...

41:50.124 --> 41:52.115
He asked about you.

41:52.693 --> 41:59.064
Charlie, he knew you were his friend.
He knew that. He did ask about you.

42:05.973 --> 42:07.941
Hey, hey, hey.
