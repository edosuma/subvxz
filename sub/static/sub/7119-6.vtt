02:10.133 --> 02:11.094
What are you doing?

02:11.141 --> 02:13.563
Splitting my toothbrush in half,
so he can use half.

02:13.743 --> 02:15.375
Here you go. It's for your teeth.

02:15.391 --> 02:16.133

02:57.398 --> 02:58.351
How about you, Jake?

03:00.268 --> 03:02.432
Maybe we should go upstairs.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.744
You can have the comfiest spot on the bed.

03:05.893 --> 03:06.791
Goodnight.

03:22.861 --> 03:23.822
Yeah, ok.

03:25.162 --> 03:26.263
Where's the little guy?

03:26.349 --> 03:27.232
Over there.

03:29.107 --> 03:29.826
Hey, pal.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.388
You ready to cut loose?

03:31.591 --> 03:32.716
Wake and shake, buddy.

03:32.763 --> 03:34.021
Let's do this thing!

03:40.628 --> 03:43.253
Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.

03:43.276 --> 03:44.628
What do you mean?

03:44.869 --> 03:45.729
Well, look at him.

03:45.784 --> 03:47.753
He's all limp... and weird.

03:48.260 --> 03:52.104
I bet he just needs some breakfast
after a night of extraordinary jiggling.

03:52.174 --> 03:55.228
Hey! Let's combine everything
we can find in the kitchen...

03:55.252 --> 03:56.737
and have the Jiggler drink it!

03:56.784 --> 03:57.995
That'll wake him up!

03:58.018 --> 03:59.198
And then we can...

03:59.229 --> 04:01.378
Get ♪ down! ♪

04:03.120 --> 04:05.401
He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.

04:05.464 --> 04:08.034
Then let's just give him some, uh...
purple whatevers.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.448
You mean the grapes?

04:10.377 --> 04:11.198
Yeah. Whatever.

04:13.636 --> 04:15.582
Hey! I think he's diggin' it!

04:16.399 --> 04:17.375
That doesn't sound good.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.079
Uh, you think we...

04:23.548 --> 04:24.837
...fed the wrong hole?

04:26.227 --> 04:28.649
Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers.

04:28.978 --> 04:32.158
What we need to do is figure out
what he <i>does </i> like to eat.

04:33.328 --> 04:35.422
Here, Jiggler.
What kind of food do you like?

04:35.454 --> 04:36.321
Meat?

04:36.478 --> 04:37.470
Some banana?

04:38.181 --> 04:40.118
This looks like corn...

04:40.165 --> 04:41.079
...I think...

04:41.102 --> 04:42.681
Uh... hot dog.

04:42.766 --> 04:44.446
Stanley the watermelon.

04:47.071 --> 04:49.172
Look! Jake! He likes it!

04:51.079 --> 04:52.048
No way!

04:53.719 --> 04:55.977
His favorite food is drawings!

04:56.032 --> 04:56.961
Awesome!

04:57.032 --> 04:59.149
Holy fig, that's awesome!

04:59.250 --> 05:00.789
What food are you drawing now?

05:00.821 --> 05:03.305
I'm drawing a picture of you.

05:03.384 --> 05:04.727
Well, don't feed it me!

05:06.695 --> 05:08.540
Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!

05:10.430 --> 05:11.172
No!

05:12.570 --> 05:14.563
Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo!

05:15.922 --> 05:16.523
No!

05:17.851 --> 05:19.734
Alright. Alright. I got it.

05:19.750 --> 05:20.742
Calm down...

05:20.765 --> 05:21.609
<i>I'll </i> eat it.

05:23.781 --> 05:28.062
Dude! You eating me is just as bad
as the Jiggler eating me.

05:28.124 --> 05:30.663
Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?

05:30.733 --> 05:33.249
Yes. If that is what must be done.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.171
I taste awesome.

05:43.204 --> 05:44.423
Ok. Alright.

05:44.524 --> 05:46.853
Now, let's get back to some jiggling!

05:46.876 --> 05:47.993
I'll get the tunes!

05:49.501 --> 05:51.063
Like this. Yeah!

05:52.219 --> 05:53.883
Come on Jiggler! Wiggle and whistle!

05:53.898 --> 05:55.305
Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts!

05:55.321 --> 05:57.516
Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!

06:05.491 --> 06:06.483
Jiggler?

06:06.702 --> 06:08.991
What the heck? What's wrong with him?

06:09.108 --> 06:11.335
Uh... There's nothing wrong with him.

06:11.374 --> 06:12.819
We just gotta plug up his holes.

06:14.054 --> 06:15.476
See? That worked.

06:15.616 --> 06:17.272
Ready to jiggle again, little guy?

06:18.288 --> 06:19.546
Oh, man...

06:21.249 --> 06:21.826
Quick!

06:21.842 --> 06:23.054
We gotta plug those holes!

06:24.334 --> 06:25.389
Jake, hurry!

06:25.553 --> 06:27.756
All I could find was your
glass eye collection!

06:27.811 --> 06:29.295
What about your eyepatch collection?

06:29.397 --> 06:31.280
Aw, man. They're in <i>mint</i> condition.

06:31.327 --> 06:31.999
Jake!!!

06:32.053 --> 06:33.170
Alright! Coming!

06:36.725 --> 06:38.374
One... more... patch!

06:39.233 --> 06:39.936
Finished.

06:41.092 --> 06:42.295
He looks terrible.

06:42.342 --> 06:44.006
Finn, I know you don't want to hear this,

06:44.014 --> 06:45.694
but I think we should cut our losses

06:45.720 --> 06:47.680
and bring this fella back
to where we found him.

06:47.756 --> 06:48.990
We can't just abandon him.

06:49.029 --> 06:51.490
Look at him, Jake.
He needs us now more than ever.

06:51.514 --> 06:54.209
Just need to take better care of you
from now on, right little guy?

06:57.373 --> 06:58.178
Jiggler!

07:01.947 --> 07:03.432
Finn. Ok...

07:04.854 --> 07:06.065
Our pet exploded.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.596
Maybe we can... scrape him up!

07:09.916 --> 07:11.205
And...

07:11.231 --> 07:11.972
Bleaurgh!

07:12.705 --> 07:14.338
Oh, holy moly!

07:14.408 --> 07:16.299
Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you.

07:21.127 --> 07:22.314
Let's gather him up, Jake.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.018
He's all over the place...

07:24.432 --> 07:25.846
even between the floorboards!

07:25.869 --> 07:27.065
And the cupboards!

07:27.127 --> 07:28.267
And the galoshes!

07:28.869 --> 07:30.510
I wonder... Where's his hiney?

07:32.565 --> 07:34.096
Found it! Come here, you!

07:34.127 --> 07:34.682
Hey!

07:36.611 --> 07:38.471
Come on. Let's put him back together.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.369
Ok.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.377
Squeeze real hard.

07:40.408 --> 07:41.283
He's slipping!

07:41.315 --> 07:42.088
Got him!

07:45.616 --> 07:47.959
Well, at least he's all in one piece.

07:50.092 --> 07:51.881
You think he's dead?

07:51.921 --> 07:52.827
No way!

07:52.874 --> 07:55.312
I won't let you die, guy! Not this time.

08:01.069 --> 08:03.030
Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?

08:03.053 --> 08:04.772
I'm kissing him! What do you think?

08:05.171 --> 08:06.444
It's all I could think to do.

08:06.857 --> 08:07.928
Just put him down.

08:18.615 --> 08:20.803
He's kissing colors with his dying breath.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.815
I think he's trying to tell us something.

08:24.941 --> 08:26.957
Finn, this looks like it could be his mom.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.042
We took this child away from
its mama, Jake.

08:33.144 --> 08:35.081
We're kidnappers <i>and</i> murderers!

08:35.214 --> 08:37.097
I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!

08:37.495 --> 08:39.441
Look... Chill out, ok?

08:39.471 --> 08:40.861
We can fix this.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.645
Check it out.

08:41.924 --> 08:44.323
His mom looks like she's out
by Stanley's house...

08:44.338 --> 08:45.636
where we found the Jiggler.

08:45.729 --> 08:48.283
If we get him back to her,
she'll be able to fix him up!

08:48.963 --> 08:50.533
Then there's no time to spare.

08:54.365 --> 08:55.881
Just hold on a little longer, buddy.

08:56.838 --> 08:57.721
Did you hear that?

08:57.846 --> 08:58.651
Whistling!

09:00.267 --> 09:02.408
<i>Perpendicular!</i> It's the mama!

09:09.288 --> 09:11.444
Look! The little guy wants to go home!

09:11.757 --> 09:13.366
Well. This is it, buddy.

09:14.241 --> 09:15.553
Be well.

09:22.936 --> 09:24.139
Hey! Stop that!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.139
I don't understand.

09:27.225 --> 09:29.006
That crazy mama almost killed him.

09:29.124 --> 09:30.342
He feels cold.

09:30.553 --> 09:32.116
What are we supposed to do now, man?

09:32.288 --> 09:34.030
We can't bring him home, or he'll...

09:34.045 --> 09:34.882
or he'll...

09:36.226 --> 09:38.554
Dang it! Why doesn't she love him?

09:38.577 --> 09:39.374
I love him!

09:39.452 --> 09:40.304
You love him!

09:40.343 --> 09:41.499
It's not fair!

09:41.820 --> 09:43.140
Finn, wait!

09:43.858 --> 09:45.796
Mama's supposed to love baby!

09:45.866 --> 09:47.585
She's supposed to <i>love</i> baby!

09:47.600 --> 09:48.264
Huh?!?

09:51.499 --> 09:52.584
Oh, man!

09:52.592 --> 09:54.210
It's yours, idiot!

09:56.007 --> 09:58.061
Don't you recognize your own baby?

09:58.077 --> 09:58.679
Finn!

09:59.225 --> 10:00.819
I figured it out, dude.

10:00.843 --> 10:01.983
It's the juice.

10:02.171 --> 10:05.140
The Jiggler needs to smell like
its mama's juice.

10:05.155 --> 10:07.187
That's how wild animals know
what’s going on...

10:07.194 --> 10:09.249
and this guy right here is all drained out.

10:09.265 --> 10:11.226
We gotta toss it in the soup, brother.

10:11.296 --> 10:12.843
Alright. Ok.

10:12.898 --> 10:15.374
I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.

10:16.851 --> 10:20.726
Word to your motheeeerrrrr!

10:34.688 --> 10:36.469
I'll never kidnap again.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.578
You said it!

10:37.898 --> 10:39.195
...That was a nightmare.
