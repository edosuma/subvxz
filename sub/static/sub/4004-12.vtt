18:08.750 --> 18:12.458
WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT?

18:12.458 --> 18:15.583
- THE MAN HAD DEMONS,
LIEUTENANT.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.083
YOUR FIRING HIM DIDN'T HELP,

18:17.083 --> 18:19.125
AND HE JUST NEEDED SOMEONE
TO HEAR HIM OUT.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.250
I WAS THE ONLY FRIEND
HE HAD LEFT.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.291
- OKAY, BUT HE MUST HAVE
KEPT CALLING YOU FOR A REASON.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.959
WHAT WAS IT?
- I DIDN'T PICK UP, I--

18:26.959 --> 18:28.792

START TALKING TO ME.

18:54.125 --> 18:57.125

SAY ANYTHING ELSE.

18:57.125 --> 19:00.333
NOT UNTIL I SPEAK
TO A LAWYER.

IT'S LISTED AS A RIVER JORDAN
CAMP FOR BOYS AND GIRLS.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.625
- RIVER JORDAN.

20:21.625 --> 20:23.542
- IT WENT BANKRUPT, LIKE,

- WHY?

20:48.542 --> 20:51.417

INVOLVED IN LIDDY'S MURDER.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.959
- THAT'S CRAZY.

20:52.959 --> 20:54.375
- I KNOW, IT IS.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.834
BUT HE REQUESTED AN ATTORNEY.
- AN ATTORNEY?

20:56.834 --> 20:58.917

- I'M NOT ASKING YOU
AS A DETECTIVE.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.500
I'M ASKING YOU AS SOMEONE
YOU LIVE WITH,

25:33.500 --> 25:37.834
SOMEONE THAT YOU SAID
YOU LOVED.

25:37.834 --> 25:41.458
I THINK I DESERVE TO KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.208
- ALL I CAN TELL YOU
IS THAT I DIDN'T KILL LIDDY.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.250
- BUT YOU WERE THERE.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.875
- IT'S NOT WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.375
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DID IT.

25:52.375 --> 25:55.875
- I KNOW.

25:55.875 --> 25:58.083
- IF YOU DIDN'T KILL LIDDY,
WHO DID?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.375
- I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
I'M SORRY.

26:04.375 --> 26:07.709
- DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

26:07.709 --> 26:10.542
JUST TELL ME
THE FUCKIN' TRUTH.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.917
- YOU SHOULD GO WORK
ON FINDING JORDAN.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.583
- JORDAN CHASE WAS GOADING YOU
ON THE PHONE,

26:38.583 --> 26:40.500
TRYING TO GET YOU
TO MAKE A MISTAKE.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.625
HE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.
- I KNOW.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.583
- YOU NEED TO STAY ALERT,
PAY ATTENTION.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.583
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S PLANNING FOR YOU.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.208
- SAME THING
I'M PLANNING FOR HIM.

26:48.208 --> 26:49.542
- YEAH, BUT ON HIS HOME TURF.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.417
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
YOUR ADVERSARY, DEXTER,

26:51.417 --> 26:52.917
NOT AGAIN.

26:52.917 --> 26:55.458
- COULD YOU JUST TRUST ME
FOR ONCE?

26:55.458 --> 26:56.542
SHIT!

27:08.000 --> 27:09.750
[gasps]

27:11.709 --> 27:14.291
[grunts]

27:14.291 --> 27:17.083
[shattering glass]

27:35.083 --> 27:36.917
[groaning]

27:47.667 --> 27:50.542
- SURPRISE.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.667
GET UP.

28:07.125 --> 28:09.709
- HEY, YOU OKAY?

28:09.709 --> 28:12.333
- YEAH. FINE.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.125
- YOU LOOK TIRED.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.291
- THANKS.

28:16.291 --> 28:18.291
- LOOK, LIKE I SAID,

28:18.291 --> 28:20.208
WE'LL KNOW MORE

28:20.208 --> 28:22.625
AFTER DEXTER TESTS THE BLOOD
ON QUINN'S SHOE.

28:22.625 --> 28:27.417
IN THE MEANTIME,
HAVE SOME FAITH.

28:27.417 --> 28:28.875
- FAITH?

28:28.875 --> 28:33.250
- WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.
DON'T ASSUME THE WORST.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.500
- DETECTIVE MORGAN?

28:47.500 --> 28:48.625
- YEAH.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.041
- I'M SORRY FOR INTRUDING.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.500
IT'S FROM YOUR STAKE
AND NOTIFY.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.291
SHOULD I PUT IT
ON YOUR DESK?

28:52.291 --> 28:53.625
- NO. WHAT--WHAT IS IT?

28:53.625 --> 28:55.834
- SOMEONE SAID
THEY SPOTTED JORDAN CHASE.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.291
- A STREET VENDOR?

28:58.291 --> 29:00.083
- YEAH, UP BY MURALIA ROAD.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.166
WEIRD THING IS,
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD

29:01.166 --> 29:02.542
NOISES COMING FROM THE TRUNK.

29:02.542 --> 29:03.834
THAT'S WHY HE CALLED IT IN.

29:03.834 --> 29:05.792
I KNOW, SOUNDS UNLIKELY.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.750
- YEAH.
MAYBE I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

29:07.750 --> 29:08.834
THANKS.

29:35.709 --> 29:40.166
- IT WAS INEVITABLE
THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

29:40.166 --> 29:42.166
TWO BROKEN PEOPLE,

29:42.166 --> 29:44.333
GOING THROUGH
INTENSE SHARED EXPERIENCES

29:44.333 --> 29:45.959
AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY.

29:45.959 --> 29:48.208
I DO IT IN MY SEMINARS
ALL THE TIME.

29:48.208 --> 29:52.125
IT PRODUCES A SENSE
OF DEEP, DEEP BONDING.

29:52.125 --> 29:55.458
I'M SURE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING,

29:55.458 --> 29:58.500
EVEN LOVE, DOESN'T IT?

29:58.500 --> 29:59.875
- LET HER GO.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.709
- YOU LOST YOUR WIFE, RITA.

30:01.709 --> 30:03.875
YOU BLAMED YOURSELF,
I'M SURE.

30:03.875 --> 30:05.333
AND YOU THOUGHT WHAT?

30:05.333 --> 30:09.583
THAT YOU COULD MAKE UP
FOR THAT BY HELPING HER?

30:09.583 --> 30:10.667
- NO.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.458
- WELL THEN,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

30:12.458 --> 30:16.166
THAT YOU COULD BE A HERO?

30:16.166 --> 30:19.166
HMM.

30:19.166 --> 30:21.625
YOU CAN'T SAVE ONE THING
TO MAKE UP FOR ANOTHER, DEXTER.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.583
IT'S JUST NOT THE WAY
THE WORLD WORKS.

30:28.041 --> 30:30.291
WOW.

30:30.291 --> 30:32.250
[chuckles]

30:32.250 --> 30:35.625
[exhales]

30:35.625 --> 30:39.083
I LOOK AT THESE,
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK

30:39.083 --> 30:41.667
THAT YOU HAVE A KIND
OF GREATNESS IN YOU.

30:41.667 --> 30:45.667
THEN I LOOK AT YOU,
AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT

30:45.667 --> 30:47.834
THAT THE IDIOTS THAT
SHOW UP AT MY SEMINARS.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.000
TOTALLY LOST.

30:53.125 --> 30:57.125
I'M GONNA PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

31:01.875 --> 31:03.125
BOTH OF YOU.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.834
[screaming]

31:13.333 --> 31:18.083
[groaning]

31:18.083 --> 31:19.959
[grunting]

31:19.959 --> 31:21.208
NO! NO!

31:21.208 --> 31:22.208
[grunting]

31:22.208 --> 31:24.750
HEY! AAH!

31:32.917 --> 31:35.625
- [speaking Spanish]

31:35.625 --> 31:36.667
JORDAN CHASE.

31:36.667 --> 31:38.750
[speaking Spanish]

31:38.750 --> 31:40.959
- HE WAS WAITING
FOR THE TRAFFIC LIGHT?

31:40.959 --> 31:42.208
- SI.

31:42.208 --> 31:46.041
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE NOISE
IN THE TRUNK?

31:46.041 --> 31:47.834
I FUCKING SWEAR I'M TAKING
SPANISH AFTER THIS.

31:47.834 --> 31:52.375
THE--THE SOUND
IN THE, UH, UH, "TRUNKO"?

31:52.375 --> 31:53.792
- OH, SI.

31:53.792 --> 31:55.542
[speaking Spanish]

31:55.542 --> 31:56.917
BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG,
BANG, BANG.

31:56.917 --> 31:57.834
- BANG, BANG, BANG,
FROM THE TRUNK?

31:57.834 --> 31:58.750
- SI.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.417
- WHICH--WHICH WAY DID--

32:00.417 --> 32:03.500
UH, UH, DONDE FUE?

32:03.500 --> 32:06.125
WHAT'S DOWN THAT WAY?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.250
QUE?

32:08.250 --> 32:09.834
- [speaking Spanish]

32:09.834 --> 32:12.333
- A "CAMPAMENTO."
A CAMP?

32:12.333 --> 32:13.625
- SI,  CAMP.

32:13.625 --> 32:15.625
- THANK YOU.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.542
UH, GRACIAS.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.417
- [moans]

32:26.583 --> 32:29.834
- YOU'LL WANT TO BE
AWAKE FOR THIS.

32:29.834 --> 32:33.709
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
BEING PRESENT IN THE MOMENT?

32:33.709 --> 32:35.834
- SO YOU WERE LISTENING,
HMM?

32:35.834 --> 32:41.583
- I HEARD THE WORDS,
BUT TO BE HONEST?

32:41.583 --> 32:45.333
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
THE SOURCE.

32:55.625 --> 33:00.083
YOU SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO DO IT.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.750
- IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

33:02.750 --> 33:04.375
- HE'S YOURS.

33:04.375 --> 33:08.458
- [laughs]
OH, PLEASE.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.458
[laughs]

33:09.458 --> 33:10.458
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE

33:10.458 --> 33:11.792
THERE'S SOME POLITE WAY
TO DO THIS,

33:11.792 --> 33:14.458
LIKE THERE'S
SOME--SOME ETIQUETTE.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.333
[laughs]

33:16.333 --> 33:18.667
KILLING IS KILLING,
DEXTER.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.542
LET'S AT LEAST BE HONEST
ABOUT THAT.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.291
- OH, YOU'RE BEING HONEST...

33:22.291 --> 33:23.834
EUGENE?

33:23.834 --> 33:26.125
- OH, YOU THINK
THAT'S AN INSULT?

33:26.125 --> 33:28.208
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

33:28.208 --> 33:31.000
IT'S A REMINDER
OF HOW FAR I'VE COME.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.375
- AND HOW FAR IS THAT?

33:32.375 --> 33:34.000
YOU'RE RIGHT BACK
WHERE YOU STARTED,

33:34.000 --> 33:35.291
ONLY THIS TIME,
YOU'RE STRAPPED TO A TABLE.

33:35.291 --> 33:37.166
- I'M TRANSFORMED.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.583
- YOU WILL BE SOON.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.333
- NOT JUST ME.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.375
YOU, LUMEN.

33:42.375 --> 33:43.500
MMM.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.750
- YOU DON'T GET TO USE
MY NAME.

33:45.750 --> 33:50.208
- [breathing heavily]
REALLY?

33:50.208 --> 33:52.417
IF WE'RE NOT ON A FIRST NAME
BASIS, THE THREE OF US,

33:52.417 --> 33:54.166
THEN WHO IS, HMM?

33:54.166 --> 33:55.333
LOOK AT YOU.

33:55.333 --> 33:58.458
YOU'RE TRANSFORMED TOO.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

33:58.458 --> 33:59.709
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:59.709 --> 34:01.834
IF YOU HADN'T MET ME,
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN

34:01.834 --> 34:03.208
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.875
- I WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD IT IN ME--

34:04.875 --> 34:06.583
- WELL, NOW YOU DO!

34:06.583 --> 34:07.500
- SHUT UP!

34:09.500 --> 34:12.667
- [laughs]

34:12.667 --> 34:14.041
IT'S TRULY AMAZING.

34:14.041 --> 34:15.375
YOU SHOULD THANK ME.

34:15.375 --> 34:16.709
- HEH!

34:16.709 --> 34:18.250
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

34:18.250 --> 34:21.709
- I WATCHED YOU SO CAREFULLY
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE.

34:21.709 --> 34:24.333
YOU USED TO
JUST COWER AND CRY!

34:25.750 --> 34:27.959
- [breathing heavily]

34:27.959 --> 34:29.333
THAT'S NOT JUST FOR ME.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.208
THAT'S FOR EVERYONE
THAT YOU HURT.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.500
EVEN EMILY.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.000
DO YOU HEAR ME?

34:36.917 --> 34:38.333
DO YOU HEAR ME?

34:38.333 --> 34:42.208
[crying]

34:42.208 --> 34:43.875
[panting]

34:49.125 --> 34:50.792
[exhales]

34:53.041 --> 34:54.917
I'M SORRY.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.041
I KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT.

34:57.041 --> 34:58.417
[exhales]

34:58.417 --> 35:00.458
- WELL, HE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THAT PART.

35:00.458 --> 35:03.083
THERE IS NO POLITE WAY.

35:03.083 --> 35:06.917
- [breathing heavily]

35:31.208 --> 35:33.875
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
LEAVE THE BODY HERE.

35:33.875 --> 35:36.834
- WE DON'T WANT
A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

35:36.834 --> 35:40.959
WE WANT CLOSURE.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.500
- SO HE JUST VANISHES,
LIKE THE OTHERS?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.250
- NO.
JORDAN'S CAR IS OUTSIDE.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.250
WE'LL USE IT
TO MOVE THE BODY.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.959
THEN, MAYBE A MONTH
FROM NOW,

35:48.959 --> 35:52.625
WE'LL TIP OFF MIAMI METRO
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

35:52.625 --> 35:55.291
EVERYONE WILL KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE.

36:33.792 --> 36:37.125
[metallic clatter]

36:40.667 --> 36:42.834
- DON'T MOVE.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.333
DON'T FUCKING MOVE.

36:47.166 --> 36:50.208
WHATEVER'S IN YOUR ARMS,
DROP IT NOW.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.375
[sheet rustles]

36:51.375 --> 36:54.375
BOTH OF YOU.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.750
[knife clatters]

37:05.375 --> 37:07.375
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.875
NUMBER 13.

37:12.875 --> 37:16.208
AND I KNOW
WHAT THEY DID TO YOU.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.083
I'VE SEEN THE TAPES.

37:18.083 --> 37:21.834
I WATCHED THEM
OVER AND OVER.

37:25.125 --> 37:28.959
IT'S A MIRACLE
YOU SURVIVED.

37:28.959 --> 37:31.083
A FUCKING MIRACLE.

37:31.083 --> 37:36.166
AND YOU, WHOEVER YOU ARE,

37:36.166 --> 37:39.250
YOU KNOW THAT TOO.

37:42.917 --> 37:44.125
[gunshot]

37:44.125 --> 37:48.208
I SAID DON'T...
FUCKING...MOVE!

37:52.333 --> 37:56.583
MAYBE IT'S TRUE SOME PEOPLE
DESERVE TO DIE,

37:56.583 --> 38:01.667
BUT I'M A COP, AND I DON'T
MAKE THAT FUCKING DECISION,

38:01.667 --> 38:04.291
SO I'M GONNA CALL THIS IN.

38:05.959 --> 38:10.125
IN AN HOUR, THIS PLACE
WILL BE SWARMING WITH POLICE.

38:17.291 --> 38:20.000
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE GONE BY THEN.

38:31.333 --> 38:32.917
- [staggered breathing]

38:46.375 --> 38:49.458
[retreating footsteps]

39:08.000 --> 39:11.083
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID
OR DIDN'T DO.

39:11.083 --> 39:15.000
AND FOR SOME REASON,
YOU'RE NOT SAYING.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.500
BUT I'M NOT JUDGING.

39:19.500 --> 39:22.166
I CAN'T JUDGE.

39:22.166 --> 39:23.792
NOT ANYMORE.

39:26.667 --> 39:29.208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:29.208 --> 39:30.959
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

39:33.792 --> 39:37.500
- YES.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.875
A LOT, ACTUALLY.

39:38.875 --> 39:42.792
A LOT
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:42.792 --> 39:46.000
YOU KNOW HOW LAGUERTA KEEPS
SAYING EVERYTHING'S COMPLICATED?

39:49.041 --> 39:52.709
I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE HER.

39:52.709 --> 39:55.417
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

39:55.417 --> 39:57.041
- ARE YOU?

39:57.041 --> 40:01.250
- MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

40:01.250 --> 40:04.417
- I'LL BE HERE
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.834
[splash]

40:20.083 --> 40:22.125
[splash]

40:29.041 --> 40:31.417
- DID YOU EVER THINK
WE'D GET HERE?

40:33.792 --> 40:35.750
- YOU DIDN'T?

40:35.750 --> 40:37.583
- NOT REALLY, NO.

40:37.583 --> 40:43.083
I MEAN, FOR A WHILE THERE,
I WASN'T SURE.

40:43.083 --> 40:46.917
IT'S LIKE
WHAT YOUR SISTER SAID.

40:46.917 --> 40:49.417
IT'S A MIRACLE.

40:49.417 --> 40:51.709
IT'S A FUCKING MIRACLE.

41:08.792 --> 41:10.583
- HOME?

41:23.166 --> 41:26.250
[engine starts]

42:52.917 --> 42:56.875
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GETTING
READY FOR HARRISON'S BIRTHDAY.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.667
- LAGUERTA SAID
THIS COULDN'T WAIT.

42:58.667 --> 43:02.166
