13:00.026 --> 13:02.227
They're saying
these new micro fibers
are taking

13:02.229 --> 13:04.495
- The carpet industry
by storm.
- Uh-uh, dad.

13:04.497 --> 13:06.330
Okay, she doesn't
care about this stuff.

13:06.332 --> 13:07.564
- Okay?

13:07.566 --> 13:09.866
Oh, I find it
fascinating,

13:09.868 --> 13:12.668
Especially that you have
a family business.

13:12.670 --> 13:13.902
It all looks so fun.

13:13.904 --> 13:15.336
Oh, it can be.

13:15.338 --> 13:17.204
I guess most days
we're either having fun,

13:17.206 --> 13:19.372
- Or ready to strangle
one another.

13:25.678 --> 13:29.080
Were you interested
in carpets as a child?

13:29.082 --> 13:31.082
- Well--
- oh, I think he
came out the womb

13:31.084 --> 13:33.217
- With a book of swatches.
- No, stop that.

13:33.219 --> 13:35.285
No, now, when we
first got started,

13:35.287 --> 13:36.753
It wasn't about carpets,

13:36.755 --> 13:38.855
I just wanted
a family business.

13:38.857 --> 13:40.890
I just came to love
carpets.

13:40.892 --> 13:43.759
- Oh.
- So, what are you doing
in denver?

13:43.761 --> 13:48.596
Uh... Um, my flight
had a layover,

13:48.598 --> 13:51.632
And then it was
cancelled,

13:51.634 --> 13:57.036
And, uh, I was out,
um, following my sons
who are djs.

13:57.038 --> 13:58.637
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

13:58.639 --> 14:01.406
Uh, they're names are
logan and cody.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.941
They call themselves
the loco twins.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.476
Which I guess, in spanish,
means crazy.

14:08.446 --> 14:10.612
Uh, maybe you know them?

14:10.614 --> 14:12.714
Um, I don't think so.

Oh. Well, they opened for
the chemical brothers.

14:15.585 --> 14:17.651
Oh, I think
I heard of them.

14:17.653 --> 14:19.919
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They're very
well respected.

14:19.921 --> 14:22.054
Wait, the chemical brothers?
I don't think--

14:22.056 --> 14:24.256
Oh, you've heard of them.
Wait, wait, wait, look.

14:24.258 --> 14:27.259

Wow.

Now, they're real
brothers, right?

14:37.302 --> 14:40.903

14:40.905 --> 14:43.338
Well, this is nice.
Very impressive, huh?

- Yes, it is.
It's cool.
- Very nice.

14:45.642 --> 14:48.609
- That's cool.
- I am done with
my tomato cutting.

14:48.611 --> 14:51.578
Oh, thank you, christine.
We're just gonna throw those
in the salad.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.313
- Okay.
- And let's eat.

14:53.315 --> 14:55.648
- It's time to eat.
- 'cause we're hungry.

14:55.650 --> 14:57.816
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
- And I'm saying the blessing
this time.

14:57.818 --> 14:59.818
Daddy, don't be too
long winded this time,
please.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.287
Make it two minutes
this time, two minutes.
Okay?

15:02.289 --> 15:04.522
Ken:
I'm gonna say "jesus wept."
we gonna be right out of here.

15:04.524 --> 15:07.024
- He knows how you--
- he gonna talk about jesus
for 20 minutes.

15:07.026 --> 15:09.493
He know he wept, okay?
He did the weeping.

15:09.495 --> 15:10.527
Let me get this bread.

15:12.764 --> 15:14.530
All right, we gotta
get her to the doctor.

15:14.532 --> 15:16.632
What are we
still doing here?

15:16.634 --> 15:19.501
Um, you know what?
I got my niece and nephew

15:19.503 --> 15:21.703
To the dentist last week
with some cookies.

15:21.705 --> 15:23.504
I probably
still have some.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.805
Yeah?
What kind are they?

15:24.807 --> 15:26.373
Mint milano.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.509
She only likes
chips ahoy,
unfortunately.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.544
Well, how would your mom
handle it?

15:31.546 --> 15:33.712
Well, she would just
eat the milanos.

15:33.714 --> 15:35.346
Or the chips ahoy.

15:35.348 --> 15:37.047
No,
I mean how would your mom
handle your grandmother?

15:37.049 --> 15:38.314
Oh, she wouldn't
put up with this,

15:38.316 --> 15:40.349
She'd just
put her foot down.

15:40.351 --> 15:42.150
- Hit me, hit me.
- Well, why don't you
try that?

15:42.152 --> 15:44.652
Oh, she's my grandmother.
I don't want to do that.

15:44.654 --> 15:46.120
Plus,
she doesn't respect me

15:46.122 --> 15:48.122
Because she thinks
I'm an idiot clown.

15:48.124 --> 15:51.958
Well, you could--
you could make her
respect you.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.061
I mean, that's what
your mom does.

15:55.063 --> 15:56.796
Maybe be a little
forceful with her,

15:56.798 --> 15:57.997
And tell her we gotta
get out of here.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.164
Yeah,
you can do it.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.399
- What's that?
- Um, high five.

16:01.401 --> 16:02.833
For what?

16:02.835 --> 16:04.534
I was trying to
help you get pumped up.

16:04.536 --> 16:08.570
- Okay, let's do it.
- It's too late.

16:10.673 --> 16:13.207
Meemaw, we're leaving
right now, okay?

16:13.209 --> 16:15.309
Okay,

16:15.311 --> 16:17.144
Hit me.

16:17.146 --> 16:19.546

16:19.548 --> 16:20.847
Can we get
the cookies, please?

16:20.849 --> 16:23.316
- Woman: Esther!
- Huh? Enid!

16:23.318 --> 16:26.585
Hey, it's free drinks and
dollar steaks in the caf.
Let's go.

16:26.587 --> 16:28.353
Oh! I'm coming.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.823
- Should I get
some more cookies?
- Yeah.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.592
And werther's originals.
Do you have those?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.560
Yes.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.530
- I can't believe
you have this.
- Yeah, well--

16:39.532 --> 16:41.331
- It's cute, isn't it?
- Oh, it is.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.800
- Yeah, reagan.
- I loved your daughters.

16:43.802 --> 16:46.435
- Oh, yeah.
- And the spaghetti.

16:46.437 --> 16:49.337
yeah,
I'm a very lucky man.

16:49.339 --> 16:52.707
Especially with darla
with all her troubles
over the years.

16:52.709 --> 16:56.777
Those two have been
my bedrock.

16:56.779 --> 16:58.879
Yeah, I'm sorry
about darla.

16:58.881 --> 17:01.615
How's she doing, uh--
how's she doing in prison?

17:01.617 --> 17:04.985
I think she's okay.

17:04.987 --> 17:07.120
You know,
I learned something.

17:07.122 --> 17:10.723
Sometimes you just have to
let your kids...

17:10.725 --> 17:12.858
Sit in their own mistakes.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.592
Sometimes
you can't fix 'em.

17:16.227 --> 17:17.360
Yeah.

17:19.296 --> 17:23.798
Well, I should
get back to the hotel.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.699
You know,
I'm guest of the day.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.667
say, listen,

17:27.669 --> 17:31.370
We have a half
a pitcher of sangria,
it's still early.

17:31.372 --> 17:33.271
Come on,
hang around a while.

17:35.474 --> 17:38.542
Okay.
Let me pour you some.

17:38.544 --> 17:40.377
- Oh.
- Oh!

17:40.379 --> 17:42.011
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:42.013 --> 17:43.479
No, no, no,
don't worry about it.

17:43.481 --> 17:45.514
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

17:45.516 --> 17:47.849
No, I'm gonna
show you something.
You're gonna love this.

17:47.851 --> 17:48.983
- I'm such a klutz.
- No, you're not a klutz.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.585
Stop it,
you're not a klutz.

17:51.587 --> 17:55.655
That's what I've been sayin',
I've been waiting to show this
to somebody.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.189

17:57.191 --> 18:00.492

18:00.494 --> 18:03.994

the carpet industry.

18:03.996 --> 18:06.029
Ready? Watch.

18:06.031 --> 18:07.063
Voila!

18:07.065 --> 18:10.833
Oh. That's amazing.

18:10.835 --> 18:12.401
Isn't that something?
Feel it.

18:12.403 --> 18:14.035
- Oh, I will.
- Feels just like wool.

18:14.037 --> 18:15.936
Oh, my god.

18:17.672 --> 18:20.373
Wow.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.842
Mm.

18:22.844 --> 18:24.610
I'm so happy I'm here.

18:26.179 --> 18:28.013
I'm glad you're here, too.

18:30.216 --> 18:33.684
I-- I didn't have
a layover.

18:34.786 --> 18:36.286
I know.

18:36.288 --> 18:38.021
I just thought,
well, would he--

18:38.023 --> 18:40.089
Would I--
should I go?
Should I--

18:40.091 --> 18:41.590
Would he want to--
oh, I don't know.

18:50.432 --> 18:51.999
oh.

19:08.316 --> 19:10.784
- Cheers to us.
- Oh, yeah.

19:10.786 --> 19:12.519
To all us.
To us.

19:15.256 --> 19:16.322
- Ahh.
- There you go.

19:16.324 --> 19:17.589
- Good.
- Meemaw.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.891
- Hm?
- Can-- can we think about

19:19.893 --> 19:21.158
Going to the doctor,
please?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.126
Oh. Edwin, did you hear
my grandson?

19:23.128 --> 19:25.061
He says I have to go
to the doctor.

19:25.063 --> 19:26.495
Is that so?

19:26.497 --> 19:29.130
I was a doctor
for 47 years.

19:29.132 --> 19:30.664
How do I look?

19:30.666 --> 19:32.766
- Oh, okay by me. Yeah.

19:32.768 --> 19:35.502
- Appointment done.
- Meemaw, please.

19:35.504 --> 19:38.071
Have something to eat.
The steaks are a buck.

19:38.073 --> 19:40.807
- I'm not hungry right now.
- Why not? Is there something
wrong with you?

19:40.809 --> 19:42.041
No, I just--

19:44.010 --> 19:46.011
I promised mom that
I would take you to
the doctor.

19:46.013 --> 19:47.912
That's all.
I'm trying to be
a good person here.

19:47.914 --> 19:49.413
I'm trying to be
a good son.

19:49.415 --> 19:52.282
I'll tell your mom
how fabulous you are.

19:52.284 --> 19:55.585
I'm trying to show her
that I have responsibility
as well. Okay?

19:55.587 --> 19:57.486
But you're doing
something responsible.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.088
You're-- you're
elongating my life

20:00.090 --> 20:02.957
Because you took me to have
a good time with my friends.

20:02.959 --> 20:04.825
- Yeah.
- What could be better?

20:04.827 --> 20:06.693
You think a doctor's
gonna make me healthy?

20:06.695 --> 20:08.094
I'm healthy when I'm
livin' my life.

20:08.096 --> 20:09.495
- Yeah.
- Right?

20:09.497 --> 20:11.463
Hey, esther, do that

20:11.465 --> 20:12.831

20:12.833 --> 20:14.499
- You should have seen her.
- No, no.

20:14.501 --> 20:16.534
- Yeah, do it.
- She was really something.

20:16.536 --> 20:18.669
- Esther.
- Get up there, esther.

20:18.671 --> 20:20.037
- Get up there, esther.
- I can't.

20:20.039 --> 20:21.304
Come on, esther,
do it.

20:21.306 --> 20:23.372
I can't walk.
How am I gonna dance?

20:23.374 --> 20:25.140
- Get outta here.
- Okay.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.775
Do the dance. All right?
Then we gotta do.

20:27.777 --> 20:30.778
- Get up there, esther.
- For you, kid, anything.

20:30.780 --> 20:33.213

20:45.990 --> 20:47.857
I'm so sorry, chip.

20:58.034 --> 20:59.834
What you thinkin' about?

20:59.836 --> 21:00.935
Oh.

21:02.671 --> 21:04.204
I was thinkin'
when I was young,

21:04.206 --> 21:07.039
I couldn't wait to move out
and start my own life.

21:09.842 --> 21:13.978
I thought I'd be an actress or
a successful business woman.

21:13.980 --> 21:16.680
And then I told myself
when the boys got out of
the house,

21:16.682 --> 21:18.181
And started their lives,

21:18.183 --> 21:20.850
That I'd do the same thing.

21:20.852 --> 21:24.186
And then I thought
dale had it together.

21:24.188 --> 21:26.254
But he didn't.
He's starting over.

21:26.256 --> 21:29.023
And, well, chip.

21:29.025 --> 21:31.859
I help them,
I wait for them,

21:31.861 --> 21:33.160
And for what?

21:33.162 --> 21:36.696
My life gets lost
in the shuffle.

21:36.698 --> 21:37.897
I don't think this time

21:37.899 --> 21:40.032
I'm gonna be able to
forgive them.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.736
You don't have to answer.
