04:06.378 --> 04:08.539
Fatima... you came.

04:09.181 --> 04:11.206
You waited.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.041
Your cds.

04:14.886 --> 04:16.285
Get on.

04:18.589 --> 04:19.887
Did you listen to them?

04:19.887 --> 04:21.153
Yes.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.192
They were okay.

04:24.630 --> 04:27.224
You have the worst taste
in music.

04:34.273 --> 04:36.434
Stop, khalid.

04:36.775 --> 04:38.265
We can't go this way.

04:38.265 --> 04:39.709
It's a shortcut.

04:39.709 --> 04:41.576
Khalid, I said stop.

04:44.616 --> 04:47.244
My father has tea here
every morning.

04:50.922 --> 04:52.480
You see him?

04:52.858 --> 04:53.608
No.

04:55.327 --> 04:56.385
Fatima.

04:56.385 --> 04:57.554
Fatima, wait.

04:57.963 --> 04:59.225
Fatima, wait.

04:59.798 --> 05:01.231
I want to meet him.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.191
I told you, you can't.

05:03.402 --> 05:04.460
Has he called?

05:04.460 --> 05:06.630
Only to yell at me.

05:09.074 --> 05:11.736
We should
run away, just go.

05:12.244 --> 05:14.041
We have our studies, fatima.

05:15.947 --> 05:17.380
We have to be realistic.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.852
Okay for you.
No one's forcing you to marry.

05:20.852 --> 05:23.286
I just want to meet him.

05:23.286 --> 05:26.223
He has chosen
someone for me.

05:27.259 --> 05:28.817
He has chosen.

05:29.428 --> 05:31.225
He might like me more.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.495
You don't know my father.

05:39.204 --> 05:40.603
Daddy.

05:44.876 --> 05:46.468
Daddy, did I wake you?

05:46.468 --> 05:48.613
No, sweetheart.

05:49.314 --> 05:51.908
Daddy, do you dream about me
when you're sleeping?

05:52.451 --> 05:53.918
I dream...

05:55.821 --> 05:56.879
about you...

05:57.189 --> 05:58.747
and your mother...

05:59.057 --> 06:01.184
and your sister.

06:03.028 --> 06:07.692
Fatima said you stop dreaming
when you get married.

06:10.001 --> 06:12.094
She's wrong, sweetheart.

06:13.038 --> 06:14.938
You dream all your life.

06:15.207 --> 06:17.175
It's one of god's gifts.

06:17.509 --> 06:18.533
Understand?

06:19.511 --> 06:21.638
- Give me a kiss.
- No.

06:21.638 --> 06:23.272
- One kiss.
- No.

06:23.272 --> 06:24.339
Only one.

07:29.848 --> 07:34.046
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

07:34.046 --> 07:35.109
Tea, please.

07:35.109 --> 07:36.381
Okay.

08:06.451 --> 08:08.146
Out the back !
Out the back !

12:31.750 --> 12:34.378
19 dead, 75 injured.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.747
El-Hazim have
claimed responsibility.

12:37.222 --> 12:38.348
And the new guy?

12:39.057 --> 12:40.388
Shrapnel in the neck.

12:40.725 --> 12:41.919
He bled to death.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.622
Damn.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.889
Sir.

12:45.889 --> 12:47.795
You have calls
from Corrine Whitman, CIA...

12:48.199 --> 12:50.724
and Mr. Davis
at the U.S. State department.

12:51.603 --> 12:52.763
Give me Corrine first.

12:57.909 --> 12:59.604
One dead American.

19:25.429 --> 19:26.896
Lina.

19:32.103 --> 19:34.901
Dad, when is
Fatima coming home?

19:38.943 --> 19:40.433
Finish your milk.

19:50.821 --> 19:53.449
Please, abasi.

19:54.058 --> 19:56.322
Tell her you made a mistake.

19:57.328 --> 19:59.922
It's not the same
as when we were young.

20:00.131 --> 20:01.325
There are rules, samia.

20:02.567 --> 20:03.829
There are rules.

20:04.835 --> 20:06.700
Look at my sister Layla.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.228
She'll never marry.

20:13.477 --> 20:15.240
Call her, Abasi.

20:16.113 --> 20:17.137
Please.

20:17.682 --> 20:19.115
For me.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.782
I have called.

20:20.782 --> 20:22.615
I've left a dozen messages.

20:22.615 --> 20:23.881
She doesn't answer.

20:23.881 --> 20:24.979
What can I do?

20:27.091 --> 20:29.457
Leave the egg alone !

20:30.361 --> 20:32.056
Have you called your father?

20:32.396 --> 20:33.727
Not yet.

20:35.066 --> 20:36.465
I'm sorry.

20:37.568 --> 20:40.594
Don't worry, it's nothing.

20:40.594 --> 20:42.868
What have I done?

20:46.877 --> 20:52.076
I'm proud of you
for standing up to him.

20:53.517 --> 20:54.984
That's my taxi.

20:55.353 --> 20:56.547
Please stay.

21:01.425 --> 21:05.327
I want you in this apartment
by eight while I'm gone.

21:06.297 --> 21:09.755
If my brother knew I was
leaving you here alone...

21:12.570 --> 21:14.060
he'd kill me.

21:14.739 --> 21:15.763
Okay?

21:20.111 --> 21:22.102
See you in a few days.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.555
My grandma has the middle floor.
I'm on top.

23:54.498 --> 23:56.625
I don't want her
to find me here.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.726
She's away for the week.

23:59.336 --> 24:02.897
I have a back way in.
No one will see us.

24:08.779 --> 24:10.246
You okay?

24:40.511 --> 24:42.308
My grandma's room.

24:44.181 --> 24:45.205
Come.

26:23.581 --> 26:24.912
like jasmine.

26:58.882 --> 27:00.611
Do you sell what you paint?

27:00.611 --> 27:02.081
Some.

27:02.419 --> 27:04.683
I'm getting better.

27:10.361 --> 27:11.555
No.

27:12.096 --> 27:13.961
Those are just drafts.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.065
That's you?

27:29.079 --> 27:30.239
And them?

27:31.682 --> 27:33.912
My brother and grandma.

27:35.886 --> 27:37.581
This is your mother?

27:38.288 --> 27:40.119
She was beautiful.

27:40.891 --> 27:43.382
You are the beautiful one.

27:48.265 --> 27:51.234
You and your brother
have the same eyes.

27:51.869 --> 27:53.427
Where's he now?

27:56.140 --> 27:57.732
Does he visit you?

27:58.509 --> 27:59.669
No.

28:00.277 --> 28:01.938
Not anymore.

28:03.113 --> 28:04.341
Are you hungry?

28:06.884 --> 28:09.478
Come, let's go to the kitchen.

34:03.607 --> 34:05.131
- Peace be with you.
- And with you.

34:22.926 --> 34:25.520
I thought you weren't coming.

34:49.585 --> 34:50.985
Come.

34:51.688 --> 34:54.054
Sir, he's here.

36:36.159 --> 36:38.389
Al jazeera
is running footage.

36:41.464 --> 36:46.766
Security authorities
have confirmed 19 deaths.

36:46.766 --> 36:49.966
Most of the victims
are women and children.

36:49.966 --> 36:53.965
A tourist video
found at the scene...

36:53.965 --> 36:56.342
shows the source of the blast.

37:04.688 --> 37:09.921
In an email to the station,
el-hazim has claimed...

37:12.662 --> 37:14.823
why the hell didn't we get that?

37:17.033 --> 37:20.127
Call abdou, I want a copy now.

37:44.227 --> 37:49.028
The struggle against
the zionist and the crusader...

37:49.599 --> 37:54.036
represents the decisive battle
between faith and infidelity.

37:54.638 --> 37:57.505
Between good and evil.

37:58.608 --> 38:04.376
The destruction of the infidel
and hypocrite is your sacred duty.

38:05.615 --> 38:09.711
When you meet the apostate you are
commanded to "strike the necks. "

38:16.059 --> 38:19.051
The crusader
talks about freedom.

38:20.930 --> 38:25.799
Jihad is the only path
to freedom.

38:26.136 --> 38:28.696
Do not fear their bullets.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.574
What can they do...

38:32.942 --> 38:35.536
but set your soul free?

38:36.479 --> 38:38.310
On the day of judgment...

38:39.482 --> 38:43.543
when you stand before
the almighty god...

38:44.287 --> 38:46.050
and he asks you...

38:47.157 --> 38:50.752
"why did you not fight
for the cause of god?

38:51.361 --> 38:55.457
"And for the oppressed. The men,
the women and the children?

38:59.369 --> 39:05.308
"What did you do
with the one weapon I gave you?

39:05.709 --> 39:07.734
"Your body. "

39:09.112 --> 39:11.740
What will be your answer?

39:12.248 --> 39:15.877
Will you display the wounds of martyrdom

39:15.877 --> 39:19.416
and walk through the gates of heaven?

39:20.657 --> 39:23.564
Or, will you hang your head

39:23.564 --> 39:28.086
in shame and roast in the fires of hell?

39:30.834 --> 39:33.667
Success is from god.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.147
May the peace and blessings and

39:35.147 --> 39:37.104
glory of god, the almighty, be upon you.

39:38.575 --> 39:39.974
Amen.

39:42.946 --> 39:43.935
Praise god.

39:43.935 --> 39:45.743
God is great !

41:20.977 --> 41:22.501
you are Egyptian. Yes?

41:25.615 --> 41:27.549
You are Egyptian.

44:48.117 --> 44:49.641
Put him in the hole.

49:06.943 --> 49:08.342
That's him.

49:08.811 --> 49:09.937
You see?

49:09.937 --> 49:11.412
Heading right for me. The dog.

49:15.251 --> 49:16.878
Is someone trying to stop him?

49:16.878 --> 49:18.045
Wait, wait.

49:18.721 --> 49:19.881
She's blocking him.

49:21.624 --> 49:23.057
The gunshot...

49:32.635 --> 49:35.103
useless.

54:32.301 --> 54:33.529
Where were you?

54:34.436 --> 54:36.028
Fatima,
what are you doing here?

54:36.372 --> 54:37.498
I was worried.

54:37.498 --> 54:40.007
You can't keep missing classes.

54:40.409 --> 54:41.433
I was busy.

54:44.079 --> 54:45.376
You were busy.

54:45.814 --> 54:46.940
Don't.

54:47.549 --> 54:49.073
Are you seeing another girl?

54:52.121 --> 54:53.110
No.

54:53.110 --> 54:54.713
Then where were you?

54:54.713 --> 54:56.349
- With Omar.
- Where?

54:56.349 --> 54:58.189
At his home. He has a problem.

54:59.762 --> 55:00.854
I am his friend.

55:01.597 --> 55:02.621
Friend.

55:07.636 --> 55:09.297
I'm sorry.

55:12.141 --> 55:13.369
I have to go.

55:14.410 --> 55:15.434
Now?

55:15.678 --> 55:16.702
Stay here.

55:16.945 --> 55:18.105
No.

55:21.250 --> 55:22.274
Please...

55:22.274 --> 55:23.910
stay with me.

55:26.121 --> 55:27.281
I'm sorry.

57:48.630 --> 57:50.029
leave us.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.918
Is Fatima here?

01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:19.625
There's...

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.028
There's a problem, Abasi.

01:01:27.076 --> 01:01:29.203
I don't know where Fatima is.

01:01:33.115 --> 01:01:34.742
But she was staying with you.

01:01:37.119 --> 01:01:38.381
I went away...

01:01:40.756 --> 01:01:42.121
Away for work.

01:01:43.258 --> 01:01:44.418
You left her alone?

01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:50.959
When was the last time
you saw her?

01:01:52.067 --> 01:01:53.091
Six days ago.

01:01:53.602 --> 01:01:55.069
Six days ago?

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.440
She's been seeing a boy.

01:02:00.743 --> 01:02:03.109
She said he was a school friend.

01:02:03.779 --> 01:02:05.178
Just a friend.

01:02:06.215 --> 01:02:07.239
What's his name?

01:02:09.985 --> 01:02:11.247
I don't know if she's with him.

01:02:11.247 --> 01:02:12.310
What's his name?

01:02:12.755 --> 01:02:13.744
Khalid.

01:02:13.744 --> 01:02:14.983
Khalid who?

01:02:14.983 --> 01:02:16.548
I don't know his last name.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.762
I'm sorry.

01:08:55.157 --> 01:08:56.522
Khalid.

01:08:56.522 --> 01:08:57.582
Smile.

01:08:59.627 --> 01:09:02.153
Wait, I want one with Fatima.

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:04.792
Fatima. Come get in the picture.

01:09:05.233 --> 01:09:06.495
Smile.

01:09:07.234 --> 01:09:08.259
Brothers and sisters.

01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:11.202
Sorry to stop the music.

01:09:12.407 --> 01:09:14.636
I just need to make
a few points...

01:09:15.444 --> 01:09:18.004
before the march tomorrow.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.581
Remember, the streets
will be lined with police.

01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:24.881
We must remain calm.

01:09:26.354 --> 01:09:27.446
We will show the world...

01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:32.185
We will show the world
that we have had enough.

01:09:32.594 --> 01:09:34.185
That we won't take it anymore.

01:09:34.863 --> 01:09:35.761
Enough!

01:09:36.231 --> 01:09:37.255
Enough!

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.304
Khalid!

01:10:26.648 --> 01:10:27.672
Khalid!

01:10:32.487 --> 01:10:33.511
Khalid!

01:10:33.788 --> 01:10:35.346
- Khalid!
- Omar!

01:10:35.824 --> 01:10:37.052
Omar!

01:10:54.609 --> 01:10:56.099
The boy's name
is Khalid El-Emin.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.243
Khalid El-Emin?

01:10:58.243 --> 01:10:59.907
I got it from the school.

01:11:00.815 --> 01:11:01.839
Father's in Paris.

01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:03.311
Mother's dead.

01:11:03.785 --> 01:11:05.650
His brother, Fadil,
had multiple arrests.

01:11:07.689 --> 01:11:09.316
We had him for a while.

01:11:10.325 --> 01:11:11.849
We let him go?

01:11:14.362 --> 01:11:16.830
He died.

01:11:27.175 --> 01:11:28.972
Where's the boy?

01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:30.602
We don't know.

01:11:31.479 --> 01:11:33.242
We're trying to find
an address for him.

01:11:34.849 --> 01:11:37.113
Then why are you standing here
like an idiot?

01:11:37.319 --> 01:11:38.343
Go!

01:11:39.054 --> 01:11:40.453
Find him!

01:11:41.323 --> 01:11:42.483
Move!

01:11:48.997 --> 01:11:50.658
Khalid, where are we going?

01:11:53.168 --> 01:11:54.328
Who is it?

01:11:54.328 --> 01:11:55.802
It's Khalid. They've taken Omar.

01:11:56.238 --> 01:11:57.398
Open, open.

01:12:00.542 --> 01:12:01.566
They took Omar.

01:12:08.683 --> 01:12:09.707
They took Omar.

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.080
Go in the kitchen
and boil some water.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.385
So we can clean him up.

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:46.243
You should not have
brought her here.

01:12:48.623 --> 01:12:50.557
What are we going to do
about her?

01:12:51.293 --> 01:12:52.385
Leave her out of it.

01:12:56.097 --> 01:12:57.257
I'm not going to her house.

01:12:58.099 --> 01:13:00.431
You've got to understand,
she is not her father.

01:13:05.974 --> 01:13:08.272
Then we will do it another way.

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:11.235
They have Omar.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.904
They will make him talk.

01:13:13.748 --> 01:13:14.772
Over.

01:13:15.417 --> 01:13:16.975
It is over.

01:13:22.757 --> 01:13:23.746
Then...

01:13:25.493 --> 01:13:27.120
we must do it now.

01:13:33.168 --> 01:13:34.931
Remember your brother.

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:40.434
Remember your brother.

01:21:38.886 --> 01:21:40.786
Who contacted you?

01:21:44.759 --> 01:21:46.556
Rashid.

01:21:46.556 --> 01:21:47.618
How?

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:51.127
He called me...

01:21:52.166 --> 01:21:53.633
on my cell phone.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:16.256
Do you know
what they will do to Omar?

01:27:20.127 --> 01:27:21.685
Do you?

01:35:28.715 --> 01:35:30.342
Sorry to wake you, sir.

01:35:31.151 --> 01:35:32.709
We have someone
who knows your daughter.

01:35:33.286 --> 01:35:34.844
Omar Adnan.

01:35:35.322 --> 01:35:37.916
He was arrested
by the riot squad last week.

01:35:38.558 --> 01:35:40.458
He knows where the boy lives.

01:39:48.241 --> 01:39:51.210
I do this in memory
of my brother.

01:42:56.863 --> 01:43:01.061
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:02.125
Tea, please.

01:43:02.125 --> 01:43:03.362
Okay.

01:44:14.674 --> 01:44:15.766
Why is he stopping?

01:44:27.554 --> 01:44:29.488
Please, he's my father.

01:44:31.291 --> 01:44:33.282
Khalid, please.

01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:38.256
Please.

01:44:40.433 --> 01:44:42.333
Please.

01:44:47.273 --> 01:44:49.741
He's not going to do it.

01:44:54.681 --> 01:44:56.945
Take him out.

01:45:04.457 --> 01:45:06.391
Take him out.

01:46:51.364 --> 01:46:53.855
When did he die?

01:46:54.734 --> 01:46:57.168
God's will.

01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:02.070
When?

01:47:06.112 --> 01:47:07.875
A week ago.

01:47:11.217 --> 01:47:13.685
They were just children.
