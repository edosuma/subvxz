00:17.102 --> 00:20.672
Okay, we've seen the rhino,
the otter and the penguins.

00:20.740 --> 00:23.541
Hey, you know, wasn't there something
weird about those penguins?

00:23.609 --> 00:24.476
What do you mean?

00:24.543 --> 00:27.545
Like, were they doing Tae Kwon Do?

00:27.613 --> 00:29.247
He knows too much.

00:29.315 --> 00:30.848
Take your shot.

00:30.916 --> 00:32.316
What?

00:32.384 --> 00:33.850
That's crazy talk.

00:33.918 --> 00:35.919
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:35.987 --> 00:38.188
Abort!

00:38.256 --> 00:39.823
Ow!

00:41.660 --> 00:43.126
Ooh!

00:43.194 --> 00:44.528
Ah!

00:44.596 --> 00:48.298
I've always wanted to
dabble in the visual arts.

00:48.365 --> 00:51.033
Um, let's bug out.

00:55.572 --> 01:00.543
Ahh, what happened?

01:00.611 --> 01:02.612
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.680
That's a very
interesting painting.

01:04.747 --> 01:06.481
Have you ever
seen such talent?

01:06.549 --> 01:10.652
I would pay top dollar to
have that hanging in my loft.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.689
I've done it.

01:13.756 --> 01:16.792
I've just designed a pocket
hyperbolic quantum accelerator

01:16.859 --> 01:19.127
that will save civilization.

01:19.195 --> 01:22.030
Well, that earns a
big "atta' boy."

01:22.097 --> 01:22.864
Gosh.

01:22.932 --> 01:26.600
There is, however, a 50% chance the
pocket hyperbolic quantum accelerator

01:26.668 --> 01:29.337
could actually destroy
civilization.

01:29.404 --> 01:32.540
I see one major problem with
your invention, Kowalski.

01:32.607 --> 01:34.074
We don't have pockets.

01:34.142 --> 01:35.609
Skipper, couldn't the 50%

01:35.677 --> 01:38.111
chance of worldwide
destruction be a problem too?

01:38.179 --> 01:39.012
Hm.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.181
Private may be onto something.

01:41.249 --> 01:42.450
Rico, what do you think?

01:42.517 --> 01:44.517
Uh-uh.

01:52.259 --> 01:55.695
That was my new calculator, gone.

01:55.763 --> 01:57.063
Back to this, I guess.

01:57.130 --> 01:59.866
Rico, destroy the right
device this time.

01:59.933 --> 02:02.434
Ooh, maybe destroy them
all, just to be sure.

02:02.502 --> 02:03.369
Okay.

02:03.436 --> 02:04.403
Wait.

02:04.471 --> 02:07.340
There is no device to destroy,
I haven't built it yet.

02:07.407 --> 02:09.241
It's just a plan.

02:09.309 --> 02:11.477
A very big plan.

02:11.544 --> 02:13.346
Oh, that's different.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.747
Plans aren't dangerous.

02:14.814 --> 02:16.248
Oh, man.

02:16.315 --> 02:19.351
Unless they fall...
into the wrong hands.

02:19.418 --> 02:20.118
Woo!

02:21.220 --> 02:26.391
No, I have wasted the best years of my
lonely, lonely life on these plans.

02:26.458 --> 02:29.427
I won't let you destroy them.

02:29.495 --> 02:30.862
Stay close to Papa.

02:30.930 --> 02:35.432
Postcard reproductions are for
sale in the "Zoovenir" shop.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.969
Shh, the <i>artiste</i> approaches.

02:39.037 --> 02:41.038
Oh.

02:48.145 --> 02:48.978
Black line right here.

02:49.046 --> 02:50.713
Ooh!

02:50.781 --> 02:51.881
Another one right there.

02:51.949 --> 02:53.616
Ah!

02:53.683 --> 02:56.286
Um, a squiggle there.

02:56.353 --> 02:58.354
Ooh.

02:59.356 --> 03:03.126
Kowalski, I don't relish global
Armageddon, except for the part

03:03.193 --> 03:07.229
with the mutant vampire motorcycle
gangs that rule the vast wastelands.

03:07.297 --> 03:10.565
Looking forward to throwing
down with those boys.

03:10.633 --> 03:11.499
Skipper!

03:11.567 --> 03:14.536
But, on the other hand, I look at
that scribble and it's just so much

03:14.603 --> 03:15.971
"gobbledygook."

03:16.039 --> 03:18.240
Life's work, Skipper.

03:18.308 --> 03:20.207
Anyway, save it or shred it?

03:20.275 --> 03:21.242
You make the call.

03:21.310 --> 03:24.511
Should I destroy my greatest
creation and deprive civilization

03:24.579 --> 03:29.350
of something wonderful, or keep it
and risk total global annihilation?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.652
I've never seen him so conflicted.

03:31.719 --> 03:34.521
Yesterday at the snow cone booth?

03:34.589 --> 03:37.723
Should I indulge myself with the
luscious but familiar flavours

03:37.791 --> 03:42.128
of a blueberry bubblegum, or do I
venture into the high risk, high reward

03:42.196 --> 03:43.896
of honeydew lemon?

03:43.965 --> 03:44.931
Oh, yes.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.399
It was as if time froze.

03:46.467 --> 03:50.470
Well, more like Kowalski froze and
time kept going... and going.

03:51.605 --> 03:53.605
It's the Ruckus.

03:56.276 --> 04:00.812
Chuck Charles here, live at the
Central Park Zoo with the art world's

04:00.880 --> 04:05.884
latest sensation, a pachyderm
with a penchant for painting.

04:05.952 --> 04:11.089
Arriving on the scene now is famed
art critic Bella von Bueno.

04:17.629 --> 04:21.699
Tell us, Bella, is Burt the
Elephant the next "Pandy Warhol?"

04:21.766 --> 04:24.468
The panda was a hack.

04:24.535 --> 04:27.371
Gentlemen, you are right.

04:27.438 --> 04:31.441
If these plans were to fall into the
wrong hands, civilization itself

04:31.509 --> 04:33.010
would come to an end.

04:33.077 --> 04:37.680
Therefore, they must be...
destroyed.

04:37.748 --> 04:39.582
Good move, Kowalski.

04:39.650 --> 04:43.386
It's nice to see you
siding with civilization.

04:43.453 --> 04:45.454
Pursue those plans!

04:48.825 --> 04:50.826
Oh!

04:51.961 --> 04:53.962
Oh.

05:00.369 --> 05:02.370
Ah?

05:03.439 --> 05:04.439
No, no, no.

05:04.507 --> 05:06.007
Aw.

05:06.075 --> 05:09.844
This does not bode well for the
abstract animal art movement.

05:12.047 --> 05:15.549
Critics, what do they know?

05:23.058 --> 05:24.591
What's this one?

05:24.659 --> 05:28.827
The elephant is going in
a bold new direction.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.029
Genius!

05:30.097 --> 05:33.599
This must go straight to the museum
for all the world to savour!

05:33.667 --> 05:36.536
But that wasn't even mine.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.104
Oh, nuts.

05:38.172 --> 05:42.375
This must go straight to the museum
for all the world to savour!

05:42.443 --> 05:46.578
On the bright side, Kowalski, your
work's the buzz of the art scene.

05:46.645 --> 05:51.149
Sure, the perfect symmetry of my equation
may look like a harmless abstract,

05:51.217 --> 05:54.619
but any evil genius with a
Van Dyke will see the truth.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.354
Let me illustrate.

05:56.422 --> 05:59.391
"I am an evil genius
visiting the museum."

05:59.459 --> 06:02.593
"Hello there, I'm
visiting the museum, too."

06:02.660 --> 06:05.529
"Can you help me find
the rainbow painting?"

06:05.597 --> 06:09.300
Private, stay on message.

06:09.367 --> 06:14.472
As I was saying, "I'm an evil
genius visiting the museum.

06:14.539 --> 06:18.108
I wish I had a pocket hyperbolic
quantum accelerator I could use

06:18.175 --> 06:20.443
to destroy the world."

06:20.511 --> 06:22.112
"Hello!"

06:26.417 --> 06:30.653
That diagram must never see
the light of track lighting.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.988
Good news, artsy elephant.

06:33.055 --> 06:36.791
I have decided to allow you to
capture my royal regalness.

06:36.859 --> 06:38.127
To what now?

06:38.194 --> 06:39.661
He wants you to paint him.

06:39.729 --> 06:40.829
Really?

06:40.896 --> 06:41.796
Are you sure?

06:41.864 --> 06:42.831
Yes.

06:42.898 --> 06:43.965
Paint me.

06:44.033 --> 06:46.901
Okay.

06:46.969 --> 06:48.536
Not me-me.

06:48.604 --> 06:49.670
The canvas.

06:49.738 --> 06:52.973
I want you to put
me on the canvas.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.675
Oh, right.

06:54.743 --> 06:56.744
Not like--

06:58.780 --> 07:00.414
Hey, that's actually pretty good.

07:00.482 --> 07:03.784
Gosh, you really think so?

07:03.852 --> 07:08.421
Yes, in fact, I wouldn't mind
having multiple copies of that.

07:08.489 --> 07:10.089
You know, to give as gifts.

07:10.158 --> 07:11.291
Hey, no problem.

07:11.359 --> 07:13.326
No, wait!

07:14.629 --> 07:15.728
Can I get one in blue?

07:15.796 --> 07:18.198
Absolutely.

07:18.266 --> 07:20.832
One child
ticket, please.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.201
How old are you?

07:25.338 --> 07:29.141
One senior ticket, please.

07:29.209 --> 07:30.509
Uh, okay, funny guy.

07:30.577 --> 07:31.777
Let's go.

07:31.844 --> 07:33.845
Huh?

07:37.483 --> 07:38.483
Ventilation shaft?

07:38.551 --> 07:39.750
Really, Kowalski?

07:39.818 --> 07:41.586
It seems a tad cliché.

07:41.654 --> 07:43.321
Ah, cliché.

07:43.389 --> 07:46.924
French for "I don't hear anyone
else coming up with anything."

07:52.363 --> 07:53.897
Hold your ground, men.

07:53.964 --> 07:54.964
I can't!

07:55.032 --> 07:58.302
That would be the
shiny smooth metal--

08:00.405 --> 08:03.907
Hey Kowalski, what's French
for "this ain't happenin'?"

08:03.974 --> 08:05.809
Touché.

08:09.079 --> 08:09.912
What?

08:09.979 --> 08:12.715
A Trojan horse?

08:12.782 --> 08:13.616
Art.

08:13.684 --> 08:15.651
I don't get it.

08:15.719 --> 08:16.985
It worked?

08:17.053 --> 08:19.222
But isn't this a cliché, too?

08:19.289 --> 08:21.224
Nah, it's a classic.

08:21.291 --> 08:22.225
Why is that?

08:22.292 --> 08:24.292
Because it was my idea.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.134
N-n-n-now!

08:35.238 --> 08:35.970
All right.

08:36.038 --> 08:38.373
Operation: Paint Remover is a go.

08:38.441 --> 08:39.241
Situation?

08:39.308 --> 08:44.511
If my self-educated guess is correct,
the diagram should be in the next room.

08:46.214 --> 08:48.215
Not so fast, Private.

08:51.553 --> 08:52.953
Alarm lasers!

08:53.020 --> 08:54.388
Just as I suspected.

08:54.456 --> 08:55.723
Kowalski, options?

08:55.790 --> 08:56.989
How do you feel about disco?

08:57.057 --> 09:00.192
Ambivalent, why?

09:00.261 --> 09:02.262
Hit it.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:22.181 --> 09:22.881
Aah!

09:22.948 --> 09:24.916
On the beat, Rico!

09:27.820 --> 09:30.321
Okay, time to shred this puppy.

09:30.389 --> 09:32.856
I can't let you do that.

09:32.924 --> 09:37.628
Look, its subtle symmetry of form
makes it a truly unique piece of art.

09:37.696 --> 09:41.632
It would be a crime to destroy it.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.535
It is rather subtle in a, you
know, unique, symmetry-ish way.

09:45.603 --> 09:46.436
Yep.

09:46.504 --> 09:50.807
Maybe, but we just can't leave it here
where any odd, wandering mad scientist

09:50.874 --> 09:52.875
with a Van Dyke could discover it.

09:52.943 --> 09:54.944
Ooh.

09:57.748 --> 09:58.548
Tada!

09:58.616 --> 10:04.486
Ah, without that plus sign, it makes no
sense as a schematic, though I question

10:04.554 --> 10:05.253
the "loon-icorn."

10:05.322 --> 10:07.155
I like it.

10:07.223 --> 10:11.660
We're here for the unveiling
of the museum's latest acquisition,

10:11.728 --> 10:15.096
the first ever created
by a nonhuman.

10:15.164 --> 10:21.769
And now, world famous art critic
Bella von Bueno will do the honours.

10:21.837 --> 10:22.804
Aye, no!

10:22.871 --> 10:24.305
This is not right.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.374
Something is different.

10:28.477 --> 10:30.345
Amateurish forgery!

10:30.412 --> 10:31.479
Amateurish!

10:31.547 --> 10:34.214
Critics can be so cruel.

10:34.281 --> 10:35.415
Buck up, soldier.

10:35.483 --> 10:39.953
You may not be recognized as a great
artist, but you are a darn good inventor

10:40.020 --> 10:42.155
of devices that could
save the world.

10:42.223 --> 10:46.493
With only a 50% chance
of destroying it.

10:46.561 --> 10:50.996
There, and they said my work
would never hang at the museum.

10:56.159 --> 10:57.445
Art.

10:57.716 --> 11:00.073
I still don't get it.
