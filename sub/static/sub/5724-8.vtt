You're a goddamn narcissist.

00:09.768 --> 00:12.135
You take everything
for your fucking self.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.703
[Alison]
Cole.

00:19.609 --> 00:21.343
I can't do this.

00:21.345 --> 00:22.945
I'm sorry.
I thought I could.

00:22.947 --> 00:25.814
It's just too fast,
and it's too confusing.

00:25.816 --> 00:27.515
It just makes it feel not right.

00:27.517 --> 00:28.583
Allison, need you.

00:28.585 --> 00:32.186
Excuse us.

One hitch, he's still hitched."

00:41.966 --> 00:44.733
Starting tomorrow,
you need to align yourself

00:44.735 --> 00:47.335
as much as possible with
the story of <i>Descent.</i>

00:47.337 --> 00:48.936
Noah...

00:48.938 --> 00:53.475
You're not really
considering this, are you?

00:53.477 --> 00:55.477
I don't want
to do this anymore.

00:55.479 --> 00:57.479
I want to go back to mediation,

00:57.481 --> 00:59.347
and I'll give you
whatever you want.

00:59.349 --> 01:01.849
Helen, all I want is co-custody.

01:01.851 --> 01:05.486
You should have that,
and you can have her too.

Jon?

02:52.526 --> 02:54.459
Can I get you a coffee?

02:54.461 --> 02:57.562
I'll never get

No, show me what you got.

03:04.804 --> 03:07.372
[Luke]
Okay, so...

03:07.374 --> 03:10.975
three calls to her
from Scott Lockhart

03:10.977 --> 03:12.843
in early March of last year.

03:12.845 --> 03:15.513
- Yeah.
- Then essentially nothing.

03:15.515 --> 03:17.481
One in April, two in June.

03:17.483 --> 03:20.084
- Length?
- [Luke] Nothing over 40 seconds.

03:20.086 --> 03:21.852
Weirdest love affair
I've ever heard of.

03:21.854 --> 03:23.854
Then in the month
leading up to Scotty's death,

03:23.856 --> 03:25.856
14 phone calls to Alison.

03:25.858 --> 03:27.625
Hmm.

03:27.627 --> 03:29.593
And she never calls him back?

03:29.595 --> 03:31.695
Not once.

03:31.697 --> 03:35.433
So she was married
to Scott's brother.

03:35.435 --> 03:37.935
She was always
attracted to Scott,

03:37.937 --> 03:39.870
but never had a chance
to move on it.

03:39.872 --> 03:42.139
She starts an affair
with Noah Solloway,

03:42.141 --> 03:43.774
and then the genie's
out of the bag.

03:43.776 --> 03:46.444
She's acting impulsively,
and then she finally

03:46.446 --> 03:49.980
has that fling with
Scott Lockhart, one night.

03:51.516 --> 03:53.150
But now she's pregnant.

03:53.152 --> 03:55.185
Now she's in a bind.

03:55.187 --> 03:56.420
Maybe the baby's Solloway's.

03:56.422 --> 03:57.487
Maybe it's Scott Lockhart's.

03:57.489 --> 04:00.257
Maybe she doesn't want to know.

04:00.259 --> 04:04.161
One thing she knows for sure,
Noah Solloway is a good thing,

04:04.163 --> 04:06.263
and she doesn't want
to lose that. Plausible?

04:06.265 --> 04:07.697
Plausible.

04:07.699 --> 04:09.566
But Scott Lockhart
is in love with her.

04:09.568 --> 04:12.936
As far as he's concerned,
she was always the one.

04:12.938 --> 04:14.904
After the fling,
he calls her a few times.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.173
She never calls him back.

04:17.175 --> 04:20.942
She just wants to put
this whole thing behind her.

04:20.945 --> 04:22.778
[scoffs]
And then what?

04:22.780 --> 04:24.546
[chuckles]
And then what, what, what?

04:24.548 --> 04:25.881
Tell me, what?

04:25.883 --> 04:28.817
Uh, Lockhart threatens
to tell Solloway

04:28.819 --> 04:30.486
the baby's actually his.

04:30.488 --> 04:33.389
- Okay, plausible.
- [Luke] Or he blackmails her.

04:33.391 --> 04:35.557
Which is not unbelievable.

04:35.559 --> 04:38.361
They seem to be
a transactional crowd out there.

04:38.363 --> 04:42.430
Or... or he is so delusional,

04:42.432 --> 04:46.368
he thinks that she will leave
Noah and actually be with him.

04:47.503 --> 04:51.739
Look, any scenario we give her,

04:51.741 --> 04:53.674
they're all equally bad for her.

04:53.676 --> 04:55.743
Regardless, at the wedding
it comes to a head.

04:55.745 --> 04:57.712
He hasn't seen her
in over a year.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.881
He loses it on her,
thus the tape.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.218
Later she's drunk, driving home,

05:03.220 --> 05:05.253
back to the city, tipsy.

05:05.255 --> 05:08.088
She... she loosens
her inhibitions.

05:08.090 --> 05:11.992
She sees a figure
on the side of the road,

05:11.994 --> 05:15.095
and as she comes up upon him,
she realizes...

05:15.097 --> 05:17.464
It's Scotty.

05:17.466 --> 05:19.599
And just a twitch
of the wheel,

05:19.601 --> 05:23.137
just one twitch.

05:23.139 --> 05:24.505
Where's Solloway
when she does it?

05:24.507 --> 05:27.607
Not our job to establish.

05:46.461 --> 05:49.228
admitted just 17%
of its applicants,

05:49.230 --> 05:50.964
just to give you an idea.

05:50.966 --> 05:54.834
There are a little over
2,000 students here on campus

05:54.836 --> 05:58.972

- You should get his number.

06:07.982 --> 06:09.549
Tell him you're in the middle
of a divorce.

06:09.551 --> 06:11.184
- No, thanks.
- Why not?

'Cause I'm not ready
to start dating.

06:12.954 --> 06:14.887

Ooh, stop.
Just stop.

06:17.292 --> 06:18.691
Right there.

06:18.693 --> 06:22.394

06:22.396 --> 06:26.131
Yeah.

- Hey, hey, Dad, wh... what...
- Come on.

06:31.871 --> 06:33.538
He's flirting with you.

06:33.540 --> 06:36.040
- I'm not interested.
- He likes you.

06:36.042 --> 06:37.275

No.

06:38.377 --> 06:40.378

Go ahead and file on in.

06:43.217 --> 06:44.881

06:50.556 --> 06:51.955
[tour guide] Now, I'm from
Florida, and it makes me

06:51.957 --> 06:53.390
- [tour guide] feel right at home.
- Payne Hall.

[tour guide]
will learn too fast,

06:59.165 --> 07:01.898

Payne Hall is the ultimate place

- Ew.
- [tour guide] It's open 24/7...

07:05.404 --> 07:07.470
You know, your dad used
to work in the kitchen here.

07:07.472 --> 07:09.639
And your Uncle Max and I
would show up really stoned

07:09.641 --> 07:12.074
and make him
give us meatballs.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.110
Can you not call him
Uncle Max?

07:16.413 --> 07:17.580
Sure.

07:17.582 --> 07:19.115
Why not?

- Your Tinder profile.

walking around campus all day,

that you and Dad did stuff?

08:51.807 --> 08:53.774

08:57.146 --> 08:59.079
No, I don't.

five good years left.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.207
God, our tenth reunion,

10:02.209 --> 10:04.510
so I'm just gonna walk around,
take it in.

10:04.512 --> 10:08.880
You could do that,
or you could meet Richard, 47.

10:08.882 --> 10:11.517
He lives five miles away, Mom.
He's a musician.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.652
Just swipe right to say
you're interested.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.020
Put your boots on please.

10:15.022 --> 10:17.022
"I like to bike,
am fluent in French,

10:17.024 --> 10:19.358
and like yourself,
I enjoy Indian food."

10:19.360 --> 10:21.225
All right,
how the fuck does Richard, 47,

10:21.227 --> 10:22.827
know I like Indian food?

10:22.829 --> 10:24.495
He read your profile.

10:24.497 --> 10:25.830
You made a profile?

10:25.832 --> 10:27.699
It's good.
You should read it.

10:27.701 --> 10:29.734
I'll pass.
Come on.

10:29.736 --> 10:32.069
- Whitney, boots.
- Ow!

10:32.071 --> 10:33.371
Shit, I'm sorry.

10:33.373 --> 10:36.341
You meant for that to happen.

10:36.343 --> 10:38.743
[Whitney] I'm probably gonna
have to sleep on Missy's futon

10:38.745 --> 10:40.545
and get bedbugs despite the fact

10:40.547 --> 10:42.313
that there's no chance
of me actually ending up here.

10:42.315 --> 10:44.215
- Her name is Chrissy.
- Same thing.

10:44.217 --> 10:45.883
Can't you see
I don't fit in here?

10:45.885 --> 10:48.018
The ass poster,
the singing groups.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.653
Oh, not a singing group.

10:49.655 --> 10:51.588
They're jocky, fratty,
conservative losers...

10:51.590 --> 10:53.490
They're also super
interesting and smart.

10:53.492 --> 10:55.425
Who will never let me in.

10:57.562 --> 10:58.896
Is that the problem?

10:58.898 --> 11:00.430
Are you worried
you won't get in?

11:00.432 --> 11:01.565
I'm not worried.

11:01.567 --> 11:02.933
I know I won't.

11:02.935 --> 11:04.134
Come on, Whitney.

11:04.136 --> 11:05.568
You're an amazing girl,

11:05.570 --> 11:07.270
and you're a legacy,
a double legacy,

11:07.272 --> 11:09.038
- which maybe shouldn't matter...
- Maybe shouldn't?

11:09.040 --> 11:10.740
But it does,

11:10.742 --> 11:12.808
and you aced your SATs, and you
got good grades this year,

11:12.810 --> 11:15.544
and you inherited
your father's ridiculous charm,

11:15.546 --> 11:17.981
so I'm sure you'll nail
the interview just like he did.

11:17.983 --> 11:19.916
You know, they let him in.
He didn't have the greatest GPA.

11:19.918 --> 11:21.751
He won a swimming scholarship.

11:21.753 --> 11:23.586
He wasn't really that good
of a swimmer, to be honest.

11:23.588 --> 11:27.122
They just saw potential in him,
and like they'll see it in you.

11:27.124 --> 11:28.891
Okay, can you stop
comparing me to Dad?

11:28.893 --> 11:31.393
I know you hate him.

11:31.395 --> 11:33.728
I'm just saying you inherited
his best qualities.

11:34.830 --> 11:37.132
Okay, let's stop.

11:37.134 --> 11:38.633
What are you doing, Whitney?

11:38.635 --> 11:40.802
[sighs]

11:40.804 --> 11:42.570
I want to have a conversation
about something.

11:42.572 --> 11:44.139
Can you have it
while we're walking?

11:44.141 --> 11:46.374
- Because we're late.
- I can't do this.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.709
Well, it's one night.
Please just suck it up.

11:48.711 --> 11:52.713
No, I'm trying to
tell you that...

11:52.715 --> 11:55.216
I don't know if I want
to go to college.

11:57.252 --> 11:59.220
Sorry?

11:59.222 --> 12:02.123
Like, at all.

12:04.559 --> 12:08.162
Uh, okay.

12:08.164 --> 12:10.797
S-since when?

12:10.799 --> 12:12.832
I've never wanted
to go to college.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.434
How come you never told me?

12:14.436 --> 12:16.669
Look, I don't want
to spend four years

12:16.671 --> 12:18.604
training to spend my life
in a cubicle

12:18.606 --> 12:20.006
and then spend my life
in a cubicle.

12:20.008 --> 12:21.942
That's not gonna happen.

12:21.944 --> 12:26.212
I just think that...

12:26.214 --> 12:28.481
maybe I want to travel,

12:28.483 --> 12:30.850
like, you know, go
to Japan or London.

12:30.852 --> 12:32.218
Well, you can do that here.

12:32.220 --> 12:33.686
You can take a junior year
abroad...

12:33.688 --> 12:37.622
No, or... or...
or maybe I...

12:40.160 --> 12:43.562
Want to move to New York
and be a model.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.202
What?

12:50.204 --> 12:52.104
- I met a photographer.
- Hey, hold on.

12:52.106 --> 12:53.538
What... you... hold on.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.307
You met a photographer?

12:55.309 --> 12:56.842
He thinks I could
be something.

12:56.844 --> 12:57.977
Who is this photographer?

12:57.979 --> 12:59.211
He saw me at a party.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.278
He gave me his number.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.545
I went to see him.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.348
He's totally legit.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.683
He says he shot Christy
Turlington's first portfolio.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.717
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- What?

13:06.719 --> 13:08.919
Christy Turlington is my age.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.522
- So what?
- So how old is he?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.858
- Why does that matter?
- You're not gonna be a model.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.394
I-I knew this was
how you'd react.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.530
I mean, a professional model?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.432
Where are you going?

13:21.434 --> 13:24.602
To meet Chrissy.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.570
You know what? I want the name
of that photographer

13:26.572 --> 13:28.071
and a phone number
because for all you know,

13:28.073 --> 13:29.373
he could be a sexual predator.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.440
Are you saying he's a pimp?

13:30.442 --> 13:31.542
No.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.276
What does that make me?

13:33.278 --> 13:36.113
All I'm saying is of course
you're beautiful,

13:36.115 --> 13:39.182
but you also have a tremendous
brain that you haven't even

13:39.184 --> 13:41.519
given yourself a chance
to see what you could do with.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.120
I don't want to go to college.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.622
It's not for me.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.523
How many times
do I have to tell you?

13:46.525 --> 13:48.558
I'm sorry. I'm your mother,
and you're so young.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.694
You don't know anything yet,
and I can't condone this.

13:51.696 --> 13:53.230
I can't.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.198
What if I'm not asking you
to condone it?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.601
What if I'm just telling you
what's about to happen?

13:58.603 --> 13:59.836
You're not gonna go to school,

13:59.838 --> 14:01.238
and you're gonna be a model?

14:01.240 --> 14:02.639
- Yes.
- I'm not paying for that.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.807
- I'm not asking you to.
- Really?

14:04.809 --> 14:06.476
Where are you gonna live?

14:06.478 --> 14:08.111
- What are you gonna eat?
- I'll figure it out.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.812
You don't even know
your own social security number.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.648
Who gives a fuck?
I'll figure it out!

14:11.650 --> 14:13.082
Shh... Whitney, stop it.

14:13.084 --> 14:15.818
Why is it so difficult
for you to imagine

14:15.820 --> 14:18.755
that I might actually
be able to support myself?

14:18.757 --> 14:20.623
- What I'm saying, you don't...
- Because you never did?

14:23.160 --> 14:25.728
Well, guess what, Mom?
I'm not you.

14:27.798 --> 14:29.799
I'm not you, okay?

14:29.801 --> 14:30.900
I'm not gonna
live off my parents

14:30.902 --> 14:32.669
for the rest of my fucking life.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.373
[Whitney]
Is that Dad?

14:39.443 --> 14:40.909
[Whitney]
Dad?

14:40.911 --> 14:43.745
[Noah] Whitney, what...
what are you doing?

14:43.747 --> 14:47.015
[Whitney]
What are you doing?

14:47.017 --> 14:48.284
[Whitney] What's up?
Why are you here?

14:48.286 --> 14:49.151
[Noah]
What are you doing here?

14:49.153 --> 14:51.820
I'm...

14:51.822 --> 14:53.322
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:53.324 --> 14:55.324
Book tour.
I've got a reading tonight.

14:55.326 --> 14:58.259
- What are you doing here?
- Whitney's college tour.

14:58.261 --> 14:59.961
Are you considering Williams?

14:59.963 --> 15:02.029
- No, Daddy, I'm not.
- I'm confused. What...

15:02.031 --> 15:05.066
Yes, I sent you the whole
itinerary a month ago.

15:05.068 --> 15:07.235
Sorry, we just added these
dates a couple of days ago.

15:07.237 --> 15:08.803
This response has been insane.

15:08.805 --> 15:09.637
[Whitney]
Is this where you're staying?

15:09.639 --> 15:10.871
[Noah]
Yeah.

15:10.873 --> 15:12.240
Do you have a suite
or anything?

15:12.242 --> 15:13.575
[Noah] Uh, I don't know.
I'll check.

15:13.577 --> 15:16.010
- [Noah] Hey, Eden?
- Who's that?

15:16.012 --> 15:17.677
That's my publicist.

15:17.679 --> 15:20.347
[Noah] Eden, this is my daughter
Whitney and my, um, ex...

15:20.349 --> 15:21.982
- Ex-wife.
- [Noah] Ex, Helen.

15:21.984 --> 15:24.218
I gave you the dates, right,
for the college tour?

15:24.220 --> 15:26.086
[Eden]
Uh, I think so.

15:26.088 --> 15:28.655
Did you know that we were all
gonna be here at the same time?

15:28.657 --> 15:31.558
Um, let me check iCal.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.260
Oh, yes, look at that.

15:33.262 --> 15:35.395
Your wife and daughter'll be
in Liamstown today.

15:35.397 --> 15:36.529
- Can I stay with you?
- Sure.

15:36.531 --> 15:38.297
No, she can't stay with you.

15:38.299 --> 15:39.565
[Chrissy]
Hey, sorry.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.800
Are you Whitney?

15:41.802 --> 15:42.868
Yeah.

15:42.870 --> 15:45.004
- I'm Chrissy.
- Hey.

15:45.006 --> 15:46.139
Hey.

15:46.141 --> 15:47.640
This is Whitney's dorm host

15:47.642 --> 15:50.309
because she's staying
in Sage tonight.

15:50.311 --> 15:52.878
- Sage Hall? Wow.
- Exactly.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.047
We have room for her, don't we?

15:55.049 --> 15:57.582
Or, look, Eden can just
book a suite for both of you.

15:57.584 --> 16:00.052
- Why don't you...
- No, thank you.

16:00.054 --> 16:03.455
Whitney is on a college tour,
and staying in dorms...

16:03.457 --> 16:04.923
- I was just offering.
- Is what you do on

16:04.925 --> 16:06.659
a college tour because
you're touring colleges.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.093
Okay, that's all I did.
I was just offering, okay?

16:08.095 --> 16:09.227
So I just want you
to back me up on this.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.863
Okay, you're backed.

16:10.865 --> 16:11.864
Should I have them book
us another suite or not?

16:11.866 --> 16:13.532
- Not.
- Not, thanks.

16:13.534 --> 16:14.566
Okay, I'll just go ahead
and check us in then.

16:14.568 --> 16:16.067
Thank you.

16:16.069 --> 16:17.435
Jesus Christ, my head
hurts all of a sudden.

16:17.437 --> 16:19.103
Yeah, do you really
want it to hurt?

16:19.105 --> 16:20.872
Tell your dad...

16:24.777 --> 16:27.779
Tell me what?

16:27.781 --> 16:29.648
Nothing.

16:29.650 --> 16:33.051
Do you understand her?

16:33.053 --> 16:34.986
Not really.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.022
So, uh, do you want to come
to my reading tonight?

16:41.926 --> 16:43.860
Uh, no.

16:50.268 --> 16:53.103
Anything you're looking for
in terms of information

16:53.105 --> 16:54.771
would be a betrayal
of attorney-client...

16:54.773 --> 16:56.574
[Helen]
All I'm asking, Jon,

16:56.576 --> 17:01.645
is what I should
prepare the kids for.

17:01.647 --> 17:02.679
The trial is in two weeks.

17:02.681 --> 17:04.181
What's your plan?

17:04.183 --> 17:06.516
I mean, are we...
is Noah gonna be all right?

17:06.518 --> 17:08.483
You were talking about
alternative suspects.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.420
Did you find any?

17:12.289 --> 17:16.026
- We have one.
- Who?

17:16.028 --> 17:18.694
I c... I haven't even shared
that information with Noah yet.

17:18.696 --> 17:20.696
Well, Jesus Christ, why not?

17:20.699 --> 17:22.699
Because it's just
a theory, Helen.

17:22.701 --> 17:24.467
I have nothing
to confirm it with.

17:24.469 --> 17:27.537
Look, I've... I've... I'm sorry.

17:27.539 --> 17:28.939
I wish I had better news
for you.

17:28.941 --> 17:31.108
I-I-I just...
we're working on it.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.508
We still have time.

What kind of confirmation
do you need?

[scoffs]

17:37.314 --> 17:39.982
You said you didn't
want to be involved.

17:39.984 --> 17:43.018
Well, I can't...

17:43.020 --> 17:46.122
just let him go to prison, Jon.

19:42.670 --> 19:44.603
and accusing him
atop the radiator,

19:46.138 --> 19:48.841
and through the doorway,
above the tea set

19:48.843 --> 19:51.510
she'd liberated from
a little Moroccan pension

19:51.512 --> 19:53.779
where they'd spent
their honeymoon,

19:53.781 --> 19:57.282
hung the portrait she'd
developed of Whitman as a baby,

19:57.284 --> 19:58.851
the winter three blizzards

19:58.853 --> 20:02.220
hit the city in quick succession
and the pipes froze,

20:02.222 --> 20:05.891
then burst in their fifth-floor
Harlem walk up.

20:07.761 --> 20:09.762
That was the winter
he decided to accept the loan

20:09.764 --> 20:12.663
from her parents.

20:12.665 --> 20:14.933
He could live without comfort
perhaps forever,

20:14.935 --> 20:17.435
but he couldn't stand
to see her afraid.

20:19.939 --> 20:22.440
By the time the snow
finally melted,

20:22.442 --> 20:25.944
they had purchased the
brownstone he was now leaving.

20:25.946 --> 20:27.412
What had become of her,

20:27.414 --> 20:32.117
that bold, unafraid girl?

20:32.119 --> 20:35.020
What had become of him,
who had worshipped her?

20:36.588 --> 20:38.656
Three feet became two.

20:38.658 --> 20:43.328
Two became one,
and then he was gone."

20:44.596 --> 20:45.630
[applause]

20:45.632 --> 20:46.631
Thank you.

20:46.633 --> 20:49.567
[applause]

20:53.004 --> 20:56.707
Thank you.

21:02.848 --> 21:03.848
That's very kind.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.817
Thank you very much.

21:05.819 --> 21:08.285
Okay, we have time
for one more question.

21:09.822 --> 21:11.788
- Yes, in the back?
- Hi, I'm Sally.

21:11.790 --> 21:14.224
I really loved your book.

21:14.226 --> 21:19.063
I want to know
if you believe love can last.

21:19.065 --> 21:20.397
[clears throat]
Because why not save

21:20.399 --> 21:21.865
the easy question
till the last?

21:21.867 --> 21:24.801
[laughter]

21:27.572 --> 21:30.240
I believe love is
a kind of faith.

21:32.143 --> 21:35.079
[Noah] And when two people
both believe,

21:35.081 --> 21:37.647
something very
powerful happens.

21:37.649 --> 21:38.748
I mean, look at it this way.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.517
If you and I are in love

21:40.519 --> 21:43.854
and I trust you enough
to lean in towards you,

21:43.856 --> 21:46.790
and you trust me enough
to lean in toward me...

21:48.292 --> 21:49.726
[Noah]
Then we meet in the middle.

21:49.728 --> 21:53.162
It's a...
it's kind of triangle,

21:53.164 --> 21:55.966
and we're holding each other up,

21:55.968 --> 21:58.034
and it's very, very strong.

21:58.036 --> 22:00.303
It's unbreakable,

22:00.305 --> 22:01.771
but if I disappear,

22:01.773 --> 22:06.109
then you... you can't
hold our house up alone.

22:06.111 --> 22:10.814
You're kind of falling
through open air.

22:10.816 --> 22:14.183
Love can't work without
the trust, without the faith.

22:16.387 --> 22:19.355
You know, that's why people
say when somebody cheats,

22:19.357 --> 22:21.257
they say he was unfaithful.

22:21.259 --> 22:24.593
Think about that word
for a moment.

22:24.595 --> 22:25.728
It's not about the sex, kids.

22:25.730 --> 22:27.696
[soft laughter]

22:27.698 --> 22:29.698
[man]
Does God exist?

22:29.700 --> 22:31.534
[laughs]

22:31.536 --> 22:33.369
Uh, well,

22:33.371 --> 22:37.073
not... not an entirely
inappropriate sequitur actually.

22:37.075 --> 22:40.809
I-I think of God the same way
as I think of love.

22:40.811 --> 22:44.712
I think if you think
that God exists, then He does,

22:44.714 --> 22:46.314
because your faith

22:46.316 --> 22:49.117
and your actions bring
His presence into the world,

22:49.119 --> 22:50.852
and the same is true of love.

22:50.854 --> 22:54.956
If you believe in its power
and you conduct your life

22:54.958 --> 22:58.693
with respect of its...
of its sanctity,

22:58.695 --> 23:03.131
then it'll always
be there to serve you.

23:03.133 --> 23:07.969
But if you don't, then...
Well, then my book happens.

23:07.971 --> 23:11.639
[laughter]

23:17.112 --> 23:20.013
[dogs barking in the distance]

23:34.262 --> 23:36.130
You want my hat?

23:36.132 --> 23:38.065
No, I'm fine.

23:41.936 --> 23:44.004
No, you're not.
Look at you.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.272
Come here.

23:46.274 --> 23:49.442
It's too big for me.

23:49.444 --> 23:51.111
It's cute.

23:56.784 --> 23:58.719
Thanks.

24:04.826 --> 24:05.826
You hungry?

24:05.828 --> 24:08.662
Fucking starving.

24:08.664 --> 24:09.763
- You want to go to...
- [both] Nona's?

24:13.101 --> 24:15.601
Wait, so you haven't
seen your mother in how long?

24:15.603 --> 24:18.704
Um, since the day
I asked her to leave,

24:18.706 --> 24:21.707
the morning after Martin
went to the hospital.

24:21.709 --> 24:23.242
And you're in contact
with her?

24:23.244 --> 24:24.844
I sent her an email
a few weeks ago,

24:24.846 --> 24:26.779
but she never responded.

24:26.781 --> 24:28.413
Hey, are you two
ready to order?

24:28.415 --> 24:29.815
Yeah.

24:29.817 --> 24:31.917
Um, you used to have
this thing that was, like,

24:31.919 --> 24:35.587
a combination
of a falafel and a waffle.

24:35.589 --> 24:37.890
- Do you still have that?
- Helen, that was 20 years ago.

24:37.892 --> 24:39.491
Hold on.
It wasn't on the menu,

24:39.493 --> 24:41.360
but I think the chef
just put the falafel

24:41.362 --> 24:42.594
in a waffle iron
or something like that?

24:42.596 --> 24:43.828
She had her 21st birthday
here.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.364
It was the highlight
of her life.

24:45.366 --> 24:46.898
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.267
Thank you.
He'll have one too.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.569
Okay, I got it.

24:50.571 --> 24:52.237
I hated that party.

24:52.239 --> 24:53.905
What are you talking about?
No, you didn't.

24:53.907 --> 24:55.541
Yeah, I did.

24:55.543 --> 24:58.109
It wasn't even my idea.
It was my mother's idea.

24:58.111 --> 25:00.245
She wanted to have
some big blowout,

25:00.247 --> 25:02.013
but it was Spring Fling,

25:02.015 --> 25:03.815
and half of our friends were too
stoned by the end of the day

25:03.817 --> 25:06.250
to even show up.

25:06.252 --> 25:07.852
Well, I had
a really good time.

25:10.322 --> 25:11.923
Remember how the fire
department showed up

25:11.925 --> 25:13.591
because there was a grease fire
in the kitchen,

25:13.593 --> 25:15.860
and you convinced me
they were strippers?

25:15.862 --> 25:18.163
You were so gullible
back then.

25:18.165 --> 25:20.098
Guess I was.

25:26.839 --> 25:30.842
That was really something,
what happened back there.

25:30.844 --> 25:32.443
You mean the reading?

25:32.445 --> 25:35.512
I guess your whole life
must be like that now.

25:35.514 --> 25:37.447
Have people cheering your name.

25:39.617 --> 25:41.985
I'm the flavor of the week.

25:41.987 --> 25:43.187
By next week,
it'll be someone else.

25:43.189 --> 25:45.422
Don't do that.

25:45.424 --> 25:47.524
Don't dismiss it.
Enjoy it.

25:47.526 --> 25:49.860
I mean, you worked
your whole life for this moment.

25:51.129 --> 25:55.298
I know, Helen.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.968
So I have some surprising news
about Whitney.

25:59.370 --> 26:01.538
Okay, please say
something good.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.506
She's met a photographer that
thinks she can be something,

26:04.508 --> 26:06.209
so she's going to move
to New York

26:06.211 --> 26:08.244
and be a model
instead of going to college.

26:13.083 --> 26:14.817
How old is the photographer?

26:14.819 --> 26:18.821
That's what I asked,
and he's old-old.

26:18.823 --> 26:20.089
Is she serious?

26:20.091 --> 26:22.992
Yeah.

26:22.994 --> 26:24.927
She's serious,

26:24.929 --> 26:27.830
and I think it's our fault.

26:27.832 --> 26:29.899
- Why?
- Because she's angry at us.

26:29.901 --> 26:33.602
She wants to get back at us
or get back at me, anyway.

26:33.604 --> 26:37.072
I don't know. She seems
to adore you no matter what.

26:37.074 --> 26:38.707
Well, maybe she
just wants some time off.

26:40.543 --> 26:42.645
- Isn't that possible?
- Well, yeah, sure, we all do,

26:42.647 --> 26:44.179
but she has to go.

26:44.181 --> 26:45.213
Why?

26:45.215 --> 26:47.015
Because what if one year

26:47.017 --> 26:49.184
turns into three years
turns into five years?

26:49.186 --> 26:50.753
I mean,
she's not gonna be a model.

26:50.755 --> 26:52.321
- We both know that.
- She could be. She's...

26:52.323 --> 26:54.089
No, she can't.
She's not tall enough.

26:54.091 --> 26:56.659
- She's too fucking smart.
- Okay, I hear you.

26:56.661 --> 26:59.728
I just... I mean, how are we
gonna stop her? She's 18.

26:59.730 --> 27:02.330
So fucking young.
I mean, she's a baby,

27:02.332 --> 27:06.000
and she makes terrible decisions
all the time,

27:06.002 --> 27:08.969
mostly, I think,
just to terrify me.

27:08.971 --> 27:11.272
[sighs] I don't know.
Can't we just say,

27:11.274 --> 27:14.409
"Look, finish applying,

27:14.411 --> 27:16.311
get accepted somewhere,
and then defer.

27:16.313 --> 27:19.079
Take a year
and get it out of your system?"

27:19.081 --> 27:20.448
- She has to go.
- Why?

27:20.450 --> 27:22.950
Because there are
some mistakes

27:22.952 --> 27:24.151
people do not recover from,

27:24.153 --> 27:26.053
and I think this is one of them.

27:26.055 --> 27:28.756
I've got to be honest with you,
Helen; I don't agree.

27:28.758 --> 27:31.625
I think everyone should take
time off before college,

27:31.627 --> 27:33.627
figure themselves out a little.

27:33.629 --> 27:35.262
Maybe if I'd had a year out,

27:35.264 --> 27:36.730
I wouldn't have
had a midlife crisis at 45.

27:36.732 --> 27:38.132
Oh, so you are having
a midlife crisis?

27:38.134 --> 27:41.068
- Had.
- It's over?

27:41.070 --> 27:44.604
Please don't look at me
like that, Helen.

27:44.606 --> 27:46.773
If we don't give her the room
to make these little mistakes,

27:46.775 --> 27:49.776
then she's gonna resent it so
much she's not gonna come to us

27:49.778 --> 27:53.280
if ever she gets
in big trouble again.

27:53.282 --> 27:56.217
I just want us to be
an option for her, don't you?

27:58.553 --> 28:02.323
Maybe you just don't want
to take responsibility

28:02.325 --> 28:04.624
for her anymore.

28:04.626 --> 28:06.360
Why? 'Cause
I don't agree with you?

28:06.362 --> 28:07.994
No, because we fucked her up,

28:07.996 --> 28:09.329
and you just don't want
to admit it.

28:10.465 --> 28:12.232
Helen,

28:12.234 --> 28:14.468
don't you have any memory
of how you were at her age?

28:14.470 --> 28:16.002
Yeah, I do.

28:16.004 --> 28:18.405
No, you don't.
You were clinically insane.

28:18.407 --> 28:20.206
Why? Because I shopped
at vintage stores?

28:20.208 --> 28:23.643
No, because you used
to get naked during our finals

28:23.645 --> 28:25.879
and walk through the library
passing out candy.

28:25.881 --> 28:27.347
That was a joke.

28:27.349 --> 28:28.448
And when we went to the Turks
and Caicos

28:28.450 --> 28:29.683
with your parents, you had,

28:29.685 --> 28:31.284
"I will not bow down, America,"

28:31.286 --> 28:33.353
- tattooed on your stomach.
- It was temporary.

28:33.355 --> 28:34.953
Yeah, well, your father
didn't know that,

28:34.955 --> 28:38.624
and he threatened
to have you institutionalized.

28:38.626 --> 28:39.658
- What's your point?
- Well,

28:39.660 --> 28:41.560
what do you think my point is?

28:41.562 --> 28:45.364
You... you gave blood twice a week
for our entire senior year

28:45.366 --> 28:46.831
to get the money to get
a one-way ticket

28:46.833 --> 28:48.901
to Tanzania
after we graduated

28:48.903 --> 28:50.903
'cause you wanted to live
with the fucking bush people.

28:50.905 --> 28:52.804
- Well, I never went.
- And why not?

29:02.048 --> 29:03.982
Because my parents
wouldn't let me.

29:08.687 --> 29:11.890
Fuck.
Fuck.

29:11.892 --> 29:14.026
[groans]

29:14.028 --> 29:17.062
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck.

29:20.065 --> 29:21.065
Where are you staying again?

29:21.067 --> 29:24.969
Is it walking distance?

29:24.971 --> 29:27.371
- I should probably get a cab.
- I'll text Eden.

29:27.373 --> 29:29.307
She'll send one.

29:32.010 --> 29:33.510
I'm sorry.

29:35.047 --> 29:36.981
For what?

29:38.917 --> 29:41.352
For making you leave Harlem.

29:44.456 --> 29:46.623
This is not to excuse
anything you've done.

29:46.625 --> 29:50.393
I want to be really clear
about that, but I just... I...

29:50.395 --> 29:53.729
[phone keys clicking]

29:53.731 --> 29:57.100
When your first book failed...

29:57.102 --> 30:01.171
I was r-relieved.

30:01.173 --> 30:02.572
I was heartbroken for you.

30:02.574 --> 30:03.873
I mean, I hope you know that,

30:03.875 --> 30:05.541
because you
were so disappointed,

30:05.543 --> 30:07.477
but I...

30:11.515 --> 30:16.086
Part of me hoped it meant you
would finally give up on writing

30:16.088 --> 30:20.656
and just be content
with me and the kids.

30:22.960 --> 30:27.230
And I guess I just couldn't see
what you really wanted.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.369
And I never in a million years
thought you would be this...

30:33.371 --> 30:36.338
this guy.

30:36.340 --> 30:38.273
Now you're here,
and I'm very proud of you.

30:45.448 --> 30:48.450
Thank you.

30:48.452 --> 30:51.587
Oh, God.
Did Eden do that?

30:51.589 --> 30:53.055
I guess so.

30:53.057 --> 30:56.893
Wow, she's good.

30:56.895 --> 31:01.697
Look, why don't you take
the pull-out couch in my suite,

31:01.699 --> 31:03.265
wake up in a nice hotel?

31:03.267 --> 31:05.767
Fuck it, take the bed.
I'll take the couch.

31:05.769 --> 31:08.703
I know how sensitive
you are to cheap sheets.

31:11.841 --> 31:13.308
No. You know what?

31:13.310 --> 31:14.809
I'm gonna walk back.
I changed my mind.

James Frey asserts

41:25.201 --> 41:27.401
that prior to the... the memoir
craze, as he refers to it,

41:27.403 --> 41:29.337
in the '90s, his
<i>A Million Little Pieces</i>

41:29.339 --> 41:30.939
would have been
published as fiction.

41:30.941 --> 41:32.540
Where do you think <i>Descent</i>

41:32.542 --> 41:35.443
lies on that scale
between fiction and memoir?

41:36.880 --> 41:39.347

41:39.349 --> 41:42.316
Well, I think we can
just assume that James Frey

41:42.318 --> 41:44.352
is creating a dense philosophy

41:44.354 --> 41:47.755

his own fiasco, don't you?

And my book is...

41:50.693 --> 41:52.226
my book is fiction.

41:52.228 --> 41:54.862
Would you consider it
literary fiction?

41:54.864 --> 41:57.097
I believe it is being
considered as such, yes.

41:57.099 --> 42:00.334

reading your book in five years?

42:02.003 --> 42:05.473

for the sake of your generation,

gonna be translated into emoji.
