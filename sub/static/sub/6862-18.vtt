WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.737
Long-distance
relationship are hard.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.106
What am I
supposed to do now?

00:05.139 --> 00:06.340
Marry me?

00:06.374 --> 00:08.509
Do you really see
yourself moving to Dallas?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.511
We have to
stop fooling ourselves.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.347
Lavon Hayes, this--
Please don't say over.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.348
I know that you
left the bar last night

00:14.382 --> 00:15.449
with another woman.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.218
You are too good
for Wade anyway.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.452
You're much
better off without him.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.787
Some things that you left
at my place.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.255
This doesn't
mean that I forgive you,

00:21.289 --> 00:22.356
but with time,

00:22.390 --> 00:24.125
we'll figure out a way
to move on.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.260
AnnaBeth, Mayor Hayes
is totally into it.
It doesn't matter.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.395
There is no
world in which

00:27.428 --> 00:28.629
I could pursue a relationship

00:28.662 --> 00:31.365
with the man Lemon once loved.
This is worth fighting for.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.101
I know you
got your girl code,

00:33.134 --> 00:34.102
but I will wait.

00:38.172 --> 00:42.042
(screaming, laughing)

00:44.445 --> 00:48.048
*

00:54.522 --> 00:57.791
What... is... happening?

00:57.825 --> 00:59.227
(gasps)

00:59.260 --> 01:00.594
Little help?

01:03.331 --> 01:04.765
(screaming)

01:05.866 --> 01:06.834
Hey, morning, Doc.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.102
Beer?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.237
Give you the locals' price.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.172
Of course you're involved.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.141
Yeah, they just kind of showed
up in the pond this morning.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.208
Cute, huh?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.877
And your immediate response
was to sell alcohol

01:16.910 --> 01:18.179
to underage students?

01:18.212 --> 01:19.780
No, that would wrong.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.715
That's why I never asked them
their age.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.185
LAVON:
Morning.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.319
I see you're enjoying

01:25.353 --> 01:27.321
Lavon's
Pond Party this spring break.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.357
When did BlueBell
become Daytona Beach?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.325
When its mayor,
that's me,

01:31.359 --> 01:34.262
sold a college tour company
on the Gulf Coast's

01:34.295 --> 01:36.130
best-kept spring break secret.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.265
I mean, why should Cancun,

01:37.298 --> 01:39.867
Panama City,
South Padre get all the

01:39.900 --> 01:43.204
tourism, money, publicity?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.172
Alcohol-related accidents,

01:44.205 --> 01:47.475
civil disturbances,
vandalism, sex crimes?

01:47.508 --> 01:49.310
Yeah, when you
put it in that tone,

01:49.343 --> 01:50.878
anything can sound bad.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.646
Oh, my God.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.882
ZOE:
 Seriously, I can't be
 the only one

01:54.915 --> 01:56.484
who thinks
this is ridiculous.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.719
I mean, since when is
it fun to get super drunk

01:58.752 --> 02:00.288
and vomit
all over yourself?

02:00.321 --> 02:03.724
I'm just glad I sent Magnolia
to Bible Camp this week.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.326
Hopefully,
the only body shot she does

02:05.359 --> 02:07.428
is the body of Christ
with a grape juice chaser.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.429
(Brick chuckling)

02:08.461 --> 02:11.232
Oh, good, Brick,
you finally hired a hot nurse.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.333
(laughing)
(sighs)

02:12.366 --> 02:13.934
You're still in town?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.270
Don't worry, I'll be
out of your hair soon enough.

02:16.304 --> 02:19.273
Yep, just landed a surgical
fellowship at Mount Sinai.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.908
It's kind of a big deal.

02:20.941 --> 02:24.378
But, hey, I'll be here for
three more days, if you, uh,

02:24.412 --> 02:26.614
want to get all up in this.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.548
That reminds me,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.583
we need to check
our stock of antibiotics.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.353
(phone ringing)
Uh, I will get that.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.454
Yeah, I figured
you'd be in here.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.789
I mean, since all the fun
is being had out there.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.358
Oh, really?

02:37.391 --> 02:38.426
And what's fun?

02:38.459 --> 02:40.194
The heat stroke, dehydration,
alcohol poisoning?

02:40.228 --> 02:41.229
That's fun.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.896
You never did a spring break.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.532
No, I used that time off
to study.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.267
And what good did that
ever do you?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.337
Hey, Doc, I'm here
for my appointment.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.804
And there's your answer.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.206
Wally, I'll be right with you.

02:52.240 --> 02:52.973
All right.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.443
Okay, so you're just

02:55.476 --> 02:57.378
coming off what seemed
like a fairly painful breakup.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.281
You could definitely
stand to cut loose a little,

03:00.314 --> 03:01.782
so I'm going to
make you an offer.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.950
(scoffs)

03:02.983 --> 03:05.319
Spring break, here,
with me.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.422
Clearly, you have
already started drinking.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.691
No, no and no.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.300
Mayor Hayes.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.336
Mayor Hayes, I cannot properly
police this town

03:22.370 --> 03:24.838
without modern
crime-fighting technology.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.873
Well, we bought you a Taser.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.807
Where is it?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.443
The Landry kid used up
all the batteries

03:29.477 --> 03:31.712
trying to bring his cat
back to life.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.315
MAN: Hey, hey, hey!
hey, hey... you two.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.449
Unless you're
giving birth,

03:35.483 --> 03:36.984
right here, right now,
in town square,

03:37.017 --> 03:39.453
nobody wants to see
your privates.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.455
LAVON:
Sergeant Jeffries
What?!

03:41.489 --> 03:42.856
We-we talked
about courtesy now.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.891
(scoffs)

03:43.924 --> 03:45.426
Bill...

03:45.459 --> 03:48.296
Oh.
SERGEANT:
Hey, hey, get back over here.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.897
BILL:
Sergeant Jeffries...

03:49.930 --> 03:52.466
Whoa, AnnaBeth... AnnaBeth.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.667
Hey, hold up.
Oh.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.002
Hey, Mr. Mayor.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.905
This is quite a
party you're throwing.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.607
Oh, I know.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.843
I half expect my parents
to show up and ground me.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.545
(chuckling)

04:06.914 --> 04:08.416
So, how are things?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.484
Things are good.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.019
With Lemon?

04:12.052 --> 04:13.854
A lot better, thanks.

04:13.887 --> 04:17.591
Good.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.826
Well, maybe you and I can...

04:18.858 --> 04:22.730
Lavon, Lemon and I...

04:22.763 --> 04:24.665
just became friends again.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.066
She's barely forgiven me

04:26.099 --> 04:27.868
for being with
you in the first place.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.671
I... I can't
risk our friendship.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.039
Not right now.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.875
I understand.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.845
Enjoy your day.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.787
Wally, the results

04:46.820 --> 04:48.656
of your stress assessment
aren't great.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.791
These numbers put you
at serious risk

04:50.824 --> 04:52.560
for high blood pressure,
blood cots,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.728
arrhythmia.
Well, it's that
time of year at work.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.963
What time is that?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.998
Every damn
minute every day.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.334
I think that you need a break.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.802
Cut back on your hours.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.671
You know, take some time off.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.639
Doc, can I
be frank with you?

05:05.673 --> 05:09.677
I mean,
doctor-patient and all...

05:09.710 --> 05:11.912
I'm thinking about
selling the Rammer Jammer.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.815
Wow, but you love that place.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.750
I know, I do,
it's my whole life.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.085
But that's the problem.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.421
I mean, between
the wife and kids

05:20.454 --> 05:22.790
and business, and yeah...

05:22.823 --> 05:26.960
You know what
my biggest regret is?

05:26.994 --> 05:30.398
Not having done enough
I actually regretted.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.733
Huh, interesting.

05:32.766 --> 05:37.538
Now I feel like my
window to live is closing.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.673
Look at them kids out there.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.043
I keep thinking, why do
they get to have all the fun?

05:43.076 --> 05:47.381
Yeah, why do they?

05:49.750 --> 05:53.454
*

05:53.487 --> 05:54.922
Hey, Wally,
man, you serious?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.690
My wife may kill me,

05:56.724 --> 05:58.058
but I want to live.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.760
Now, if you're
worried about your job,

05:59.793 --> 06:02.396
I'll put in a good word
for you with whoever buys it.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.466
Me. I want to buy it.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.401
(laughing)

06:07.435 --> 06:09.437
That's a good one.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.605
You had me going, though.

06:11.639 --> 06:15.809
(laughing)

06:18.111 --> 06:19.680
AnnaBeth, I have an idea.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.615
Listen, I
know that this place

06:21.649 --> 06:25.152
is a hole, but, with some
new wallpaper and table cloths

06:25.185 --> 06:27.020
and a chef
that can actually cook,

06:27.054 --> 06:28.622
we could do
something with it.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.657
We?

06:29.690 --> 06:30.891
Yeah, oh, no.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.926
If you want to buy
the Rammer Jammer, go ahead.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.795
But it's an opportunity

06:34.828 --> 06:35.963
I'm willing to give up

06:35.996 --> 06:37.631
for the sake of our friendship.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.900
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.769
I don't know where
I'd get the money, so...

06:41.802 --> 06:44.638
Mm, Brick would give
you the money.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.774
Yeah, but then that would be him
buying the Rammer Jammer,

06:46.807 --> 06:47.941
and having a say in everything.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.578
You were right, AnnaBeth,

06:50.611 --> 06:53.046
it is time for me
to do something on my own.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.181
With your help,
of course.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.083
Of course.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.820
*

07:17.605 --> 07:18.739
Mayor Hayes.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.073
Ruby.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.909
You-you're not here,
you're supposed to be in Dallas.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.811
My grandfather's
being a pain again.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.178
Sheriff Bill's going to
lock him up

07:25.212 --> 07:26.914
if I don't watch him
for a few days.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.883
Were you gonna call?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.853
I just-- that might be weird.

07:34.555 --> 07:39.126
You know,
kind of like this.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.028
It seems crazy our not having

07:41.061 --> 07:42.830
a cup of coffee at least.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.933
Yeah, I agree.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.267
Coffee tomorrow.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.136
Okay.
All right.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.972
(quietly):
All right.
Bye.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.944
Woodwork,
that's what I'm going to do.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.811
Mm.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.813
Make things.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.849
Wood things.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.717
You know who was a carpenter?

08:03.751 --> 08:04.852
Jesus?

08:04.885 --> 08:05.886
Larry Winicki.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.688
Well, that is,
till he cut off

08:07.721 --> 08:09.022
the last two
fingers on both hands.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.891
Then he
looked like a T.rex.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.194
Oh, crap.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.195
Jonah Breeland.

08:15.228 --> 08:18.131
I thought I had
successfully avoided that jerk.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.568
Jonah,
I love that guy.
Why?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.603
Why does
everyone love that guy?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.972
He is a disingenuous womanizer

08:25.005 --> 08:27.107
who always gets what he wants.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.709
That's what we love about him.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.110
Wally, my man.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.745
Jonah.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.113
(grunts)

08:33.145 --> 08:35.115
George.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.918
I'm not a fan of yours.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.251
I'm sorry.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.854
I can say that now.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.155
Okay, you were always
Lemon's favorite cousin,

08:43.190 --> 08:47.194
so I had to be nice, but,
I'm not with Lemon anymore,

08:47.227 --> 08:48.896
so I can say that now.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.030
I do not like you.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.299
George, your words,
they cut.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.301
Not like knives,
because you're really dull,

08:54.334 --> 08:55.669
but more
like the soft teeth

08:55.703 --> 08:57.037
of some
leaf-eating mammal.

08:57.070 --> 09:01.241
Well, I do not
have to care what you think

09:01.274 --> 09:03.677
because I do not like you.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.612
(laughing)

09:04.645 --> 09:06.079
George has always
been jealous-- always!

09:06.113 --> 09:07.848
GEORGE:
Jeal... (scoffs)

09:07.881 --> 09:09.282
Jealous of what?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.383
Eh, you've been stuck
in the same relationship

09:10.417 --> 09:13.053
for countless years
while I have enjoyed the company

09:13.086 --> 09:15.155
of Alabama's finest
young ladies.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.256
Oh, yeah, like I would

09:16.289 --> 09:17.825
want to enjoy the company

09:17.858 --> 09:19.893
of any woman stupid
enough to fall for your

09:19.927 --> 09:21.361
transparent load of crap.
Huh? Huh?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.663
Hey.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.064
Hey, George.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.667
Okay, so, you were right.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.201
I have had a crappy
couple of months.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.937
And I am ready to
erase those memories

09:29.970 --> 09:31.071
with some
trashy new ones.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.140
ZOE: Brick is on
call tomorrow night,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.341
so I am free to par-tay.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.375
Are you in?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.277
Spring breakology is on.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.613
Okay, pick me up
at the office at 7:00

09:39.647 --> 09:41.849
and don't say spring breakology
ever again.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.251
Hm, funny...

09:44.284 --> 09:46.286
she doesn't seem stupid.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.825
(car horn honks)

09:51.859 --> 09:53.927
(seagulls calling)

09:53.961 --> 09:56.063
(birds singing)

10:04.805 --> 10:05.839
Wow.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.374
Fanny packs are back?

10:07.407 --> 10:10.210
And to think,
I just gave mine away.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.212
Well, I know it's not
a fashion statement,

10:12.245 --> 10:13.280
but it is cute.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.382
I'm preparing for tonight.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.751
I have snacks,
water, first-aid kit.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.252
Spring break is
gonna be my bitch.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.855
Yeah, well,
be careful, all right?

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
Guys can be real
dogs at those things.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.726
Just watch out.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.094
Wait a minute,
guys can be dogs?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.996
That is so good to know.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.398
If only I had a time machine
to take me back six months.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.133
Yeah, well, you're
already going back to the '90s,

10:33.166 --> 10:36.036
so, you know, you can just make
a little pit stop along the way.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.738
Happy spring break, Doc.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.842
(cheering)

10:41.875 --> 10:43.043
Yes!

10:43.076 --> 10:45.145
(laughing): Yes!

10:45.178 --> 10:47.080
Hello, Jonah.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.749
How predictable
that I would find you

10:48.782 --> 10:49.983
at foam wrestling.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.752
Ah, just supporting
the advancements

10:51.785 --> 10:53.787
Title 9 has
given us, Tucker.

10:53.821 --> 10:54.922
Yeah, listen.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.025
Jonah, I just want
to say that Zoe Hart

10:58.058 --> 10:59.793
is a good person, okay?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.229
And she has been
through a lot, lately,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.364
so the last thing
she needs right now

11:04.397 --> 11:07.167
is a sleaze ball trying to
take advantage of her.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.135
Wow.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.470
Does she have a mental
impairment of some kind?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.139
No, she does not.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.274
Then I guess she's capable
of making sound decisions.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.076
So if she wants to play doctor
with an actual doctor,

11:16.109 --> 11:19.046
that would be
none of your business.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.082
*

11:27.020 --> 11:30.824
CROWD (in unison):
35... 36... 37... 38...

11:30.858 --> 11:32.125
So, how's Dallas?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.094
It's good, it's good.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.897
I've...you know, I've made
some really good friends,

11:36.930 --> 11:38.766
the job is great...

11:38.799 --> 11:40.200
the malls are amazing.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.234
Ah, malls.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.469
See, I knew there was something

11:42.502 --> 11:44.037
in Dallas you couldn't get here.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.405
Uh...

11:45.438 --> 11:46.406
(chuckles)

11:46.439 --> 11:47.775
What up, spring break?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.042
Y'all ready to party?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.744
Then come on, jump on

11:50.778 --> 11:52.245
and we'll ride
on over to Fillmore,

11:52.279 --> 11:54.882
home of the $10,000

11:54.915 --> 11:56.283
Beer Pong Contest.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.450
Now, come on.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.819
(cheering)
Come on, now.

11:58.852 --> 11:59.820
Come on.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.821
No, no!

12:00.854 --> 12:03.356
Pay no attention to the cowboy
with the bullhorn.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.958
Yeah, come on, just--
I'll help you up.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.493
Take you to a real city.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.427
Who is that?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.029
Todd Gainey, Sr.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.430
Mayor of Fillmore.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.333
I should've known he'd try
to hijack my spring break.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.969
LAVON: Why is everybody
getting on the truck?

12:16.003 --> 12:18.806
I-I'm sorry,
I got to go fix this.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.274
W-Wait. You know what,
maybe... maybe I can help.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.376
You know, my company sponsored

12:23.410 --> 12:25.378
a "Hands on a Hard Body" contest

12:25.412 --> 12:26.847
last month,
down in Corpus Christi.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.848
Huge hit.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.516
I can't pull something like that

12:29.549 --> 12:30.918
together so quickly.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.519
You can't, but I can.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.520
For real?

12:33.553 --> 12:34.788
Yeah.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.522
Why?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.391
B-B-But if you offering,
I'm saying yeah.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.993
You-you get
that going, and...

12:40.027 --> 12:42.863
I'll get Sheriff Bill
to impound the truck.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.997
Okay...
Okay.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.365
(laughs)

12:45.398 --> 12:47.400
*

12:51.905 --> 12:53.173
(insects trilling,
crickets chirping)

12:53.206 --> 12:54.507
JONAH:
 All right, Hart.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.409
Time to party.
Oh.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.344
Okay, I just need a few minutes.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.212
Brick should be on his way back.
All right.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.248
(phone rings)

13:05.418 --> 13:06.586
This is Dr. Hart.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.587
Hey, Zoe,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.156
it's, uh, it's George.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.157
Hey, George.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.291
Hey, look, um...

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
uh, Brick and I,
we went out fishing

13:13.460 --> 13:16.296
and on the way back,
we got a flat tire.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.131
Well, when will you be back?

13:18.165 --> 13:19.366
I don't know, I mean,

13:19.399 --> 13:20.968
it could be a few hours.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.002
A few hours?!

13:22.035 --> 13:23.170
But I have spring break.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.905
I know. I know.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.173
I... I am so sorry.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.440
But we will be back

13:27.474 --> 13:29.376
as soon as possible, all right?

13:29.409 --> 13:30.844
All right.

13:34.481 --> 13:38.318
Ah, classic,
classic George Tucker.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.619
What are you talking about?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.855
He's sabotaging
our date on purpose.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.590
You know, he already warned me
to stay away from you.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.093
I-I guess that wasn't
blatant enough.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.427
No, he didn't.
Why would he do that?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.495
Well, maybe
he doesn't want me

13:48.528 --> 13:49.897
doing it with the...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.932
the girl he left his fiancée
at the altar for.

13:51.965 --> 13:55.869
Well, you are
so, so far off base.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.337
And who ever said
that you and I

13:57.370 --> 13:58.605
were gonna have sex?

13:58.638 --> 14:02.175
Well, it was kind of implied.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.376
George would not
sabotage our date.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.644
George is good.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.480
George is... you are not.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.955
The town of BlueBell,

14:14.988 --> 14:18.358
Mobile Bay's hot new
spring break destination,

14:18.391 --> 14:20.427
is really turning up
the heat this week

14:20.460 --> 14:22.562
with its new hard body contest,

14:22.595 --> 14:25.332
"Palms on a Pleasure Craft."

14:28.001 --> 14:29.202
Well?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.570
How'd it go?

14:30.603 --> 14:33.373
Well, I brought your idea
to the Belle investors' fund,

14:33.406 --> 14:35.575
and they were very enthusiastic.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.610
They all contributed something.

14:37.644 --> 14:38.611
Oh!

14:38.645 --> 14:39.612
That's amazing.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.114
How much did we raise?

14:41.148 --> 14:44.551
Six hundred
and forty-eight dollars!

14:44.584 --> 14:46.586
AnnaBeth,

14:46.619 --> 14:48.255
raising your voice
high like that

14:48.288 --> 14:49.256
doesn't make it sound like more.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.257
I thought it might.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.524
No.
Well.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.525
And there's more bad news:

14:52.559 --> 14:54.127
Ruby Jeffries is in town.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.929
What? Why?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.130
For some reason,

14:57.164 --> 14:59.266
she's sponsoring
a hands on a boat contest.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.268
(scoffs)
It's crazy.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.503
That thing is worth,
like, $50,000.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.706
Say what?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.408
Okay, now, when I give
the whistle,

15:08.441 --> 15:10.143
you must put
one hand on the boat

15:10.177 --> 15:12.579
and keep at least
one hand on the boat,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.414
the winner being the last person

15:14.447 --> 15:17.117
with one hand on the boat.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.418
So, if there are
no other contestants...

15:18.451 --> 15:19.452
Oh! One more.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.558
(clears throat)

15:25.592 --> 15:27.560
Well, Lemon Breeland.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.431
This is one contest
you might actually win.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.599
I'm not in it.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.301
Oh, I will win it.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.304
And I thank you in advance
for giving me the money

15:37.337 --> 15:39.439
to buy the Rammer Jammer.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.113
Oh, you have
got to be kidding me.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.947
Hmm.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.455
Are you sure that I need this?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.025
Yes, because when you win,

15:58.058 --> 16:00.060
you will be on TV.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.328
Ow! AnnaBeth!

16:01.361 --> 16:03.430
You just mascara'd my eyeball.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.134
(Lemon sighs)

16:07.167 --> 16:08.401
Poor Lavon.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.437
We should pray for his soul.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.172
He is clearly weak-willed

16:12.205 --> 16:15.175
as far as the Jeffries devil
is concerned.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.310
But we cannot let ourselves
get distracted by her.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.645
We have a contest to win.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.513
You're right.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.249
Absolutely right.
Mm-hmm.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.151
So, who you doing it for?

16:24.184 --> 16:27.154
Oh, um... me, I guess.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.588
I guess I'm doing it for my dad,

16:28.621 --> 16:30.223
even though he's not
here to see it.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.392
Hell, he probably
wouldn't even

16:32.425 --> 16:34.227
want me having a boat...

16:34.261 --> 16:36.063
since he died at sea.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.297
Oh.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.498
Well, it's whatever.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.101
You know, I just figured,
if I win it--

16:41.134 --> 16:43.436
and, I mean, what are
the chances of that?--

16:43.470 --> 16:46.073
I'd put his name
right up there on the stern

16:46.106 --> 16:48.575
and I'd sail to all the
places he never got to go.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.244
Because he died...

16:51.278 --> 16:54.147
trying to save the dolphins.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.416
Wade Kinsella,
what are you talking about?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.118
Your daddy is alive and drunk,

16:58.151 --> 16:59.552
right here in this town--
are you trying

16:59.586 --> 17:01.254
to trick this poor girl

17:01.288 --> 17:02.622
into letting you win
the contest?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.057
No!

17:04.090 --> 17:05.092
No, of course not.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.359
I'm trying to trick her
into sleeping with me.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.362
Whoa!

17:09.396 --> 17:10.530
Hello. Zinger.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.265
(laughs) Yeah.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.266
Judges?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.135
(grunts)

17:16.703 --> 17:18.305
You think you got
what it takes?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.507
Come on.
Did you see that?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.642
Wade might actually have
half a brain in his head.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.711
We need to start
culling the herd, too.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.680
ZOE: Now, you're gonna
keep that on

17:27.714 --> 17:28.848
for the next two weeks.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.418
Oh, thank God.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.819
That was the third idiot

17:32.852 --> 17:34.654
to jump from the
Whippoorwill Blossom balcony

17:34.687 --> 17:36.123
into the pool.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.124
Well, the
Whippoorwill Blossom...

17:37.157 --> 17:38.125
Doesn't even have a pool?

17:38.158 --> 17:39.226
Yeah, I realize that.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.560
But you're back now,
so you can handle it from here.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.695
Well, ah... not exactly.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.564
Oh, no.
Yeah, yes, I hurt

17:44.597 --> 17:46.699
the darn thing trying
to loosen a lug nut, and...

17:46.733 --> 17:48.301
Why did you even
go fishing today?

17:48.335 --> 17:49.702
You knew how busy we'd be.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.538
Well, I thought we'd be back
in a couple hours.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.140
You want to blame someone,
it was George

17:53.173 --> 17:54.474
who insisted we take
the scenic route home.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.476
That's how I got lost

17:56.509 --> 17:58.145
and popped a tire to begin with.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.212
It was George's idea?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.713
Yeah, h-he said
something about

18:00.747 --> 18:02.749
migrating ducks and how we
couldn't afford to miss them.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.583
Stay here.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.219
Take this acetone
into the exam room.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.088
I'll be right back;
I have a lawyer to kill.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.860
LEMON:
It's an affliction,

18:13.893 --> 18:15.695
is what it is.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.330
Sometimes I just
get so competitive

18:17.364 --> 18:18.665
that something
clicks inside of me

18:18.698 --> 18:21.501
and I'm just not
myself anymore.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.470
I mean, that poor girl just...

18:23.503 --> 18:25.605
wanted to win prom queen.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.375
She does walk straight
upright again,

18:28.408 --> 18:29.909
and she was even
in People magazine

18:29.942 --> 18:31.678
as one of those
people who pressed on

18:31.711 --> 18:34.381
even after a
horrible accident.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.723
Well, well, well.

18:43.756 --> 18:47.194
Look like we're
the only ones left.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.396
And you are sorely outmatched.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.498
Why do you even want
the Rammer Jammer, Lemon?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.566
Buying that bar is my dream.
Well, too bad,

18:53.600 --> 18:54.534
it's my dream, too.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.636
Hey, you two.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.838
I just wanted
to say thanks

18:58.871 --> 19:00.373
for trimming the fat
around here.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.574
Where'd you come from?

19:01.608 --> 19:02.609
Oh...

19:02.642 --> 19:03.743
I like to lie in wait.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.245
Kind of like a panther.
(throaty hiss)

19:05.278 --> 19:07.214
(gasps)
Yeah, I do about

19:07.247 --> 19:09.716
20 events on the hard body
circuit every year.

19:09.749 --> 19:13.253
Yeah, you think you're tired
now, wait another 36 hours.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.256
Your ankles swell,
you sweat hot and cold...

19:16.289 --> 19:18.725
but it's when
the hallucinations

19:18.758 --> 19:20.927
kick in that you need
to start to worry.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.230
'Cause at that point,
you are just

19:23.263 --> 19:26.266
one thin step away
from brain damage.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.401
Uh... hallucinations?

19:28.435 --> 19:31.271
When you start
to hallucinate... bail.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.406
Otherwise your friends
will be playing

19:33.440 --> 19:35.475
"Hands on a Casket."

19:36.643 --> 19:38.378
Yours.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.812
Yeah, I got that.
Great.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.382
So, who wants to sing a song?

19:42.415 --> 19:43.716
* Oh...

19:43.750 --> 19:44.951
* 99 bottles

19:44.984 --> 19:46.786
* Of beer on the wall,
99 bottles of beer *

19:46.819 --> 19:49.256
(Wade joins in): * You take
one down, you pass it around *

19:49.289 --> 19:50.923
* 98 bottles of beer
on the wall *

19:52.659 --> 19:54.294
George?
Hey, Zoe.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.396
Did you sabotage
my date with Jonah?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.564
What?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.299
No.
Did you tell Brick

19:59.332 --> 20:01.368
to take the scenic route
back from fishing?

20:01.401 --> 20:02.835
And did you tell Jonah
not to take me

20:02.869 --> 20:03.903
to spring break?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.706
Yeah, George, did you?

20:06.739 --> 20:07.640
Hey, Tansy.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.841
Um...

20:08.875 --> 20:11.411
well, uh...

20:11.444 --> 20:12.312
yeah.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.446
I did.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.315
Why would you do that?
Are you jealous?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.450
That better not be it,
'cause we have been over that.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.552
Yes, we have been over that.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.720
Ba-Baby, we have been over that.
I know.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.788
I was here.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.990
Okay, so, uh, no,

20:24.023 --> 20:25.258
not jealous.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.826
Now, could it seem

20:26.859 --> 20:29.396
that these two events
are related?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.563
ZOE & TANSY:
Yes.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.533
Yes.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.602
But... they aren't.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.570
Okay? It was Brick's fault.
He was driving the car.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.571
How could I predict

20:38.605 --> 20:39.906
that he would hit a tree trunk,

20:39.939 --> 20:41.274
and then get a flat tire,

20:41.308 --> 20:43.009
and then hurt his hand
trying to fix it?

20:43.042 --> 20:44.544
I'm not Nostradamus.
(chuckles)

20:44.577 --> 20:45.612
(clears throat)

20:45.645 --> 20:48.581
But, yes, as far as Jonah goes,

20:48.615 --> 20:50.049
I don't like the guy.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.050
Okay, Zoe?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.352
He's a player.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.586
And he takes
advantage of women,

20:53.620 --> 20:54.987
so, as a friend...
Whoa.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.789
Did it ever occur
to you that maybe

20:56.823 --> 20:58.858
I was taking advantage of him?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.627
I don't know if you noticed,
but I haven't

21:00.660 --> 21:01.761
been having
the best time lately.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.563
And if I wanted
to cheer myself up

21:03.596 --> 21:04.764
with a little spring break fun,

21:04.797 --> 21:06.666
I am perfectly entitled to.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.601
With or without your judgment.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.802
So, now, if you'll excuse me,

21:09.836 --> 21:11.037
I'm going to call my date,

21:11.070 --> 21:12.639
who hopefully will
still talk to me

21:12.672 --> 21:15.542
after I defended you
and called him a jerk.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.390
Hello?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.325
Oh, hey.

21:32.359 --> 21:33.726
Hey, Brick,
I just, uh...

21:33.760 --> 21:35.628
figured I'd bring
your stuff back.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.397
What... what you got there?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.965
Oh, more of
Shelby's stuff.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.400
Uh, girl loves her
hair products.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.300
Hmm.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.670
Well, it looks, uh,
looks a little heavy.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.538
Didn't think you'd be able
to lift that

21:45.572 --> 21:47.006
after you smashed
your hand up yesterday.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.742
Oh! Oh, uh, yeah, right.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.943
Well, you know, uh...

21:50.977 --> 21:52.945
well, the swelling
went down,

21:52.979 --> 21:56.082
I took the splint off,
and by golly, good as new.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.851
Oh.
And thank you
for, uh, bringing

21:58.885 --> 21:59.952
all that stuff.
Yeah.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.588
Of course, of course.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.056
Uh, I should get...
I should get going. Um...
Yeah.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.459
Hey, you know what, Brick?
Uh, I'm sorry.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.827
If you are feeling better,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.862
maybe, uh... maybe
you could give Zoe

22:09.896 --> 22:11.831
a call and cover
the office for her

22:11.864 --> 22:13.633
so she could go to spring break.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.369
Yeah, sure, uh, right--
I'll give her a call right away.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.370
Okay.
All right.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.638
Yeah.
Thanks.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.673
Uh, I'll see you around, Brick.
Yeah.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.651
WOMAN:
Good morning, Mobile Bay!

22:31.684 --> 22:33.920
It's Kitty Lyons continuing
our live coverage

22:33.953 --> 22:37.123
of BlueBell's Palms
on a Pleasure Craft contest.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.126
* We will all go out
to see her when she comes *

22:40.159 --> 22:42.061
* We will all go out
to see her... *

22:42.094 --> 22:44.597
(whispers):
Psst. Wade.
Hold on.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.600
I want to hear what happens
next in the song.
Wade...

22:47.634 --> 22:51.003
Wade, we either
team up now

22:51.037 --> 22:53.473
and take this
crazy lady down,

22:53.506 --> 22:57.510
or she'll go sailing off singing
into the sunset on your boat.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.046
WOMAN: * She'll be riding six
white horses when she comes *

23:00.079 --> 23:02.682
* She'll be riding six white
horses when she comes *

23:02.715 --> 23:04.484
* She'll be riding
six white horses *

23:04.517 --> 23:05.885
* She'll be riding
six white horses... *

23:05.918 --> 23:07.887
*

23:07.920 --> 23:10.657
ZOE: Listen, I'm sorry about
last night. You were right.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.025
It turns out George isn't
exactly your biggest fan.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.762
Yes, he told me
that himself.
So when Brick called me

23:15.795 --> 23:17.764
and said that his hand was
better and he could work,

23:17.797 --> 23:19.966
I figured it was my chance
to make it up to you.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.935
So, I looked up a list of the
top ten spring break activities,

23:22.969 --> 23:25.938
but since most of them
involved showing boobs,

23:25.972 --> 23:27.540
I looked up
the second top ten.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.577
I figured that we could do
keg stands, Jell-O shots,

23:30.610 --> 23:32.845
and watch the best booty
contest before lunch.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.514
Wow, someone's taking
spring break

23:34.547 --> 23:36.048
by the horns.
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I'm tight.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.950
We should get a drink.
But not at a bar.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.619
I want my drink
funneled or luged.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.921
Luged, right? You can
get a drink luged?
Look, Zoe...

23:41.954 --> 23:44.123
the whole point
of spring break is just to...

23:44.156 --> 23:46.793
is just to be
a little spontaneous.

23:46.826 --> 23:50.830
Do the things that you've never
let yourself do before.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.967
How about we just... see
where the moment takes us?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.506
(laughs)

23:59.539 --> 24:00.540
(chuckles)

24:00.573 --> 24:02.642
Oh...!

24:04.010 --> 24:06.012
Hey, Lemon, why don't you
get your daddy, just go out

24:06.045 --> 24:07.547
and buy you a boat?
Go on, get out of here.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.681
Give up.

24:08.715 --> 24:11.250
Bad news, Kinsella-- you need
a license to drive a boat.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.953
You never passed a test
in your entire life!
WADE: Oh, I got a test for you.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.923
How many Belles does it take
to lose a $50,000 boat?
Oh, shut up.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.792
You know, you're just scared
because you know that
I have a will of steel.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.194
Whatever, Lemon.
Cucumber plane fairy mojo.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.196
LEMON:
Watermelon overalls.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.132
You're just a wood-chip
zebra anyway, Rippy.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.000
(Wade braying)

24:28.034 --> 24:29.869
(screeches)

24:32.572 --> 24:33.973
Hallucination?

24:34.006 --> 24:35.742
No... (clears throat)

24:35.775 --> 24:37.243
No, it's too soon.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.145
LEMON:
Surrender Dorothy.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.147
Phone home.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.250
No brain... no brain damage.
(Wade squeals, growls)

24:47.754 --> 24:49.088
(gurgles)

24:49.121 --> 24:51.724
I'm out.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.059
I'm not gonna wind up
in the hospital.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.594
(grunts)
Yes!

24:54.627 --> 24:56.996
(Lavon chuckles)
(whoops)

24:57.029 --> 24:58.731
LAVON:
So that's why
you wanted me

24:58.765 --> 25:00.867
to get Tom Long's
lizard costume.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.536
(chuckles)
That's just evil.
(chuckles)

25:03.570 --> 25:06.773
Yeah!
(whoops, chuckles)

25:07.907 --> 25:09.909
Alliance over.
Damn right.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.581
Hi!

25:14.614 --> 25:17.717
Hi. George, more of your past
has come to visit.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.118
Well, hello, Shelby.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.720
You look nice.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.890
Here to hit me again?
No.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.625
I'm just being neighborly.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.160
Now that I've moved in
with Brick and all.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.896
I brought you
a chiffon cake.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.733
Now, that is nice, but you will
have your hands full

25:33.766 --> 25:36.202
baking cakes for every neighbor
in BlueBell.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.071
Okay, fine.
I have an agenda.

25:39.105 --> 25:39.906
GEORGE:
Mmm.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.674
To hit me?
No.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.676
It's about Brick.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.244
I'm worried.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.079
That he's too old for you?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.114
No.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.115
Sorry.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.917
He just isn't
acting himself.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.019
He's a little... off,

25:53.052 --> 25:56.889
clumsy and getting
a lot of headaches.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.825
Come to think of it, he did
have a headache yesterday

25:58.858 --> 26:00.259
when we were coming home.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.994
Before he drove the car
into the tree?

26:02.028 --> 26:04.664
Yeah.
Okay. Now, I have
what some people would call

26:04.697 --> 26:06.265
"alarmist tendencies."
Like this one time

26:06.298 --> 26:08.735
I was convinced my mom
was struck by the Holy Spirit

26:08.768 --> 26:10.302
and speaking in tongues,
when really she was

26:10.336 --> 26:12.605
just practicing
her Chinese language tapes.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.174
So I'm sure that...
that Brick is fine,

26:15.207 --> 26:17.309
and I'm just overreacting.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.280
Right?

26:22.314 --> 26:24.150
Yeah.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.218
ZOE:
 Spring break!

26:26.252 --> 26:27.353
Okay, just be careful.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.989
This'll get you drunk
super quickly.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.859
Well, as a doctor, you should
know that alcohol metabolizes

26:32.892 --> 26:33.826
at a fixed rate, so...

26:33.860 --> 26:35.394
Oh, Zoe.
There you are.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.328
Seriously?

26:36.362 --> 26:37.496
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.700
Uh, but I need to talk to you.
JONAH:
Of course you do.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.202
Just as she happened to be
having fun-- with me.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.704
Okay, this isn't
about you, Jonah.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.305
Zoe, I'm sor... sorry.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.040
You are upside down.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.742
Jonah!
Yeah.

26:49.776 --> 26:50.777
Oh, my God.

26:50.810 --> 26:54.013
Look, it's about Brick.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.215
Uh, Shelby said that he's
been really clumsy lately.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.350
And that he's been getting
a ton of headaches.

26:58.384 --> 27:03.289
And then there's this
miraculously healed hand injury.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.391
Wait, Brick would not fake
a hand injury-- no way.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.859
That is not like him.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.095
No, it's not.
Later, Tucker.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.430
Okay, look, Shelby is worried.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.700
Okay? And the more
I think about it,

27:13.733 --> 27:14.967
when were driving home,
that tree branch

27:15.001 --> 27:18.270
was in the middle of the road
the whole time, but Brick swears

27:18.304 --> 27:20.306
that it came
out of nowhere.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.374
I really think something might
be going on with him.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.376
So, tripping--
I mean, that's balance.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.412
Virus--
maybe stress-related?

27:26.445 --> 27:29.015
He's a doctor-- if it was
a virus, he would've rested up.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.349
Unless he's covering up symptoms

27:30.382 --> 27:32.051
because he already knows
it's something more serious.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.721
We need to go see Brick.
Now.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.323
George, thank you.
You did the right thing.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.430
Bad balance, blurred vision
and headaches--

27:44.463 --> 27:46.432
your symptoms
are serious, Brick.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.301
You are exaggerating.
Could be a migraine or nothing.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.402
Or a thyroid problem.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.938
Or a brain tumor.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.973
(sighs)
We got to get you
checked out, Brick.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.975
You can't ignore this.

27:56.008 --> 27:56.843
And frankly, I don't know
why you'd want to.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.211
We have to call your family
and Shelby.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.013
No! We are not calling Shelby.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.251
Look...

28:05.284 --> 28:08.254
Shelby and I... (sighs)

28:08.287 --> 28:10.256
we just got together.
She just moved in.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.324
I-I don't want her thinking
she's saddled

28:12.358 --> 28:14.093
with some dying old man.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.262
Brick, you're not dying,

28:16.295 --> 28:18.931
and you're...
I will call Mobile Presbyterian.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.834
I'll set up an MRI
for the morning.

28:21.868 --> 28:25.037
But no one is calling Shelby
or anyone else.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.305
Whatever you want.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.474
ZOE:
I'll pick you up

28:28.507 --> 28:30.509
in the morning.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.444
Good.

28:32.478 --> 28:35.314
(gulls squawking)

28:38.317 --> 28:39.385
Oh, hey.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.454
Can you believe
this is still going on?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.824
Yeah, they're not giving up,
are they?

28:44.857 --> 28:47.393
Oh... looks like
you've got company.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.832
AnnaBeth, I...

28:52.865 --> 28:55.367
No... need to explain.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.270
Enjoy your dinner.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.375
(sighs)

29:03.409 --> 29:05.377
Hi.
(chuckles)

29:05.411 --> 29:07.079
You brought me a picnic?

29:07.113 --> 29:09.849
Well, I figured
you'd be hungry, so I...

29:09.882 --> 29:11.517
brought you your favorite--
chicken pot pie.

29:11.550 --> 29:15.521
Okay, uh, Ruby,
what's going on here?

29:15.554 --> 29:19.058
I mean, are you... Did you come
back here to try to win me back?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.860
I didn't. Honestly.

29:20.893 --> 29:21.961
I...

29:23.062 --> 29:26.799
But after I saw you
for the first time again, I...

29:26.833 --> 29:28.767
I knew.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.204
I love Dallas.

29:32.238 --> 29:35.041
I love my life.
I love all of it.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.844
Except the part
where you're not in it.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.879
Oh.

29:41.013 --> 29:44.383
So, uh...
what are you saying?

29:44.416 --> 29:47.854
I'm saying
I want you back, Lavon.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.389
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes this time

29:50.422 --> 29:53.459
to make it work.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.495
Just promise me
you'll think about it.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.836
Yeah. O-Okay.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.872
Okay.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.253
AnnaBeth, are you okay?

30:21.287 --> 30:22.989
Me?
(chuckles)

30:23.022 --> 30:25.858
I'm not the one who's about
to stand up for another night.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.894
I'm fine.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.264
(birds chirping)

30:37.069 --> 30:39.972
You ready to give up yet,
Wade Kinsella?

30:40.006 --> 30:43.309
Why? Are you fading?
(chuckles)
Me?

30:43.342 --> 30:47.947
(singsongy):
Never.
Yeah, well, me neither.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.349
I'm surprised.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.418
You always been so good
at quitting.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.154
Ooh. Burn.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.523
Yeah, see, everybody already
knows that, all right?

30:57.556 --> 30:59.425
They're expecting it.

30:59.458 --> 31:03.029
I got one more chance to prove
to you and everybody else...

31:03.062 --> 31:05.965
they bet wrong.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.500
Why... of all times now?

31:08.534 --> 31:12.238
Why don't you just let me
have the damn boat?

31:12.271 --> 31:14.240
Why do you
even care so much, Lemon?

31:14.273 --> 31:16.542
Go bake some cupcakes, okay?

31:16.575 --> 31:17.977
Decorate a house.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.345
Do something else.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.247
Anything.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.183
How, exactly, Wade?

31:24.216 --> 31:26.252
Ask for help?

31:26.285 --> 31:29.655
This-- keeping my hand
on this stupid boat--

31:29.688 --> 31:33.625
is the one thing
I can do by myself.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.628
It is my one shot
at being a grownup.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.265
Do something on my own.

31:39.298 --> 31:43.169
(sighs)
Hey.

31:43.202 --> 31:46.005
Doc? Are you a mirage?

31:46.038 --> 31:49.408
Oh, no. She's come as a doctor
to put us out of our misery.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.543
You should go first.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.545
Uh, what's going on?

31:53.579 --> 31:56.448
Okay, Brick didn't want
me to tell you this,

31:56.482 --> 31:58.717
and don't be alarmed, but I
thought that you should know

31:58.750 --> 32:01.020
he's going to get an MRI
this morning

32:01.053 --> 32:03.289
at the hospital
in Mobile.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.057
An MRI?

32:05.091 --> 32:06.658
On what?

32:06.692 --> 32:10.129
His cranial region.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.563
On his brain?

32:13.032 --> 32:14.366
Is he okay?

32:14.400 --> 32:16.635
Probably. Yeah.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.605
AnnaBeth, what do I do?
I have to go.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.273
Contestants get
one bathroom break per hour.

32:21.307 --> 32:24.543
Lavon, hush!
Uh, it's okay.

32:24.576 --> 32:28.214
We'll find another way
to get the money.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.554
Okay, I...

32:35.587 --> 32:37.589
I have to leave.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.229
It's a tie!

32:44.263 --> 32:46.398
Praise Jesus!

32:46.432 --> 32:48.434
KITTY:
It's over!

32:52.438 --> 32:54.073
Lemon, come on.
I'll drive you.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.108
You can follow me.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.079
Why did you just...?

33:00.112 --> 33:02.514
Well, it's no fun to
win like that, Lemon.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.053
(groans quietly)

33:09.588 --> 33:12.091
Yup.

33:18.797 --> 33:22.468
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.

33:22.501 --> 33:25.437
Dr. Forrest,
please dial one-one-eight.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.439
Anything?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.475
Not yet. Soon.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.611
Brick's skull is so thick,

33:32.644 --> 33:35.281
the MRI probably just
needs a few passes.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.128
A.B., you should go.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.130
What?!

33:51.163 --> 33:53.299
No! I am your friend.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.301
I want to be here for you.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.303
And you always are.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.705
But I haven't been such
a good friend to you.

34:01.607 --> 34:05.411
I saw you looking
at Lavon and Ruby.

34:07.379 --> 34:11.217
I've been selfish,
keeping you from him.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.585
I was wrong.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.822
And... I'm sorry.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.159
Lemon, you don't need to...

34:20.192 --> 34:21.427
Go.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.330
Go fight for your man.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.400
Go.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.469
(laughs)

34:35.241 --> 34:38.277
Shelby? How did you know
we were here?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.710
Well, Brick

34:39.745 --> 34:41.580
was acting like a lead float

34:41.612 --> 34:44.183
in a parade
leaving town this morning.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.351
Forced me to use
his phone tracking device.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.585
(scoffs)

34:47.619 --> 34:49.487
Is he okay?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.657
We don't know yet.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.835
I hope no other patient's
family has any need

35:03.869 --> 35:05.704
for this waiting room
today, 'cause...

35:05.737 --> 35:08.840
(laughs)

35:08.874 --> 35:12.844
Listen, I'm sorry for accusing
you of being jealous of Jonah.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.846
Oh, no... no, no.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.249
No, that's okay.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.251
I mean, because
there were ducks,

35:19.285 --> 35:22.254
and that's why you
took the scenic route.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.855
Black-bellied whistling ducks.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.624
Yeah, they're in migration
right now.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.327
It's actually
a rare sight to see.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.895
Really? Whistling ducks?

35:29.928 --> 35:31.463
What do they whistle?

35:31.497 --> 35:32.898
Show tunes, mostly.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.166
It's very annoying.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.301
(both laughing)

35:35.334 --> 35:37.369
I'm glad that
I missed that.
Yeah.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.338
Um...

35:39.371 --> 35:40.806
(sighs)

35:40.839 --> 35:44.376
But look, I guess
that there was a...

35:44.410 --> 35:46.745
part of me that

35:46.778 --> 35:51.250
did suggest to Brick
to take the scenic route.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.520
And it was just because
I-I couldn't...

35:54.553 --> 35:55.954
(sighs)

35:55.987 --> 35:57.789
...couldn't stand Jonah
being with you.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.359
Because?

36:00.392 --> 36:03.195
Because he doesn't
appreciate you, Zoe.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.331
He's not capable of it.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.533
He's, uh...

36:07.566 --> 36:10.802
He's not gonna see
all that you...

36:10.836 --> 36:13.439
how special you are.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.245
He just doesn't see you--
that's all, that's all.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.512
(laughs)

36:20.546 --> 36:22.514
That's nice.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.251
Thank you.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.520
Yeah, but as for being jealous
in that other way?

36:28.554 --> 36:30.622
No. Not at all.
Oh, I mean, come on.

36:30.656 --> 36:31.823
'Cause we
have been...
(scoffs)

36:31.857 --> 36:33.259
Yeah, over that.
Over.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.760
Many times.
Many, many.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.462
Um, uh, it's a relief.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.464
Okay, good, good.

36:38.497 --> 36:42.934
However, I am not proud of
the way that I act around him.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.936
I let him get under my skin.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.739
So, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna be better about that.

36:49.475 --> 36:50.809
Look, I'm gonna
get something to eat.

36:50.842 --> 36:51.877
You-you want anything?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.645
Oh, no.
I'm good, thanks.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.281
Okay.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.764
Want to see
my closet-organizing app?

37:12.798 --> 37:14.800
Yeah.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.504
You almost done?

37:18.537 --> 37:22.007
Almost.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.611
Okay, well, I just... I just
need that bag of potato chips,

37:25.644 --> 37:27.913
right there, so...
It's the last bag, and I...

37:27.946 --> 37:30.949
You know, I was thinking
about getting those myself.
No, you weren't.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.684
Mm-hmm.
No, you weren't.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.886
You heard me say that I wanted
the bag of potato chips,

37:34.920 --> 37:36.688
and now-now, you want the bag
of potato chips.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.690
How about I get
the bag of chips,

37:38.724 --> 37:39.825
and you can have
my leftover crumbs?

37:39.858 --> 37:40.959
How about you just...

37:40.992 --> 37:42.828
you just get out of the way,
and let me have the chips?

37:42.861 --> 37:45.397
I was here first.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.300
GEORGE: Will you just give me
the... give me... just...?

37:50.068 --> 37:51.770
...get into shirts.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.440
Daddy!

37:54.473 --> 37:55.607
Are you okay?

37:55.641 --> 37:57.376
What did they say?

37:57.409 --> 38:00.846
Oh, uh...
no, I-I'm just fine.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.047
Yeah.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.650
The, uh...
the MRI was totally clear.

38:04.683 --> 38:05.651
(Lemon whoops)

38:05.684 --> 38:07.018
LEMON:
Thank God.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.421
Yeah, the doctor said

38:09.455 --> 38:11.490
it was an ophthalmic migraine,

38:11.523 --> 38:13.759
and it's entirely treatable.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.861
Well, thank God.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.566
I don't know
what I would have done

38:20.599 --> 38:22.000
if something was
the matter with you.
Well...

38:25.537 --> 38:27.539
LAVON:
Yeah. Yeah.

38:27.573 --> 38:28.740
Yeah.

38:28.774 --> 38:31.677
You're here. Good.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.912
Um, listen...

38:33.945 --> 38:37.883
I know Ruby's back,
and she's bringing you picnics

38:37.916 --> 38:39.685
and making googly eyes at you,

38:39.718 --> 38:41.887
but before
you make any decisions,

38:41.920 --> 38:45.424
you should know I'm throwing
my hat in the ring, too.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.826
I don't have a picnic,

38:47.859 --> 38:50.596
or, at this second, a hat,
but I can get both.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.398
(laughs)

38:52.431 --> 38:53.965
So...

38:53.999 --> 38:55.734
Anyway.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.906
Yours is the only hat
in the ring, AnnaBeth.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.941
Ruby left.

39:04.643 --> 39:09.014
See, uh, I told her I had
feelings for someone else.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.518
You did?

39:12.551 --> 39:14.152
Yeah.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.488
You do?
(laughs)

39:23.495 --> 39:25.997
*

39:26.031 --> 39:29.000
So... we won a boat.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.736
Yeah.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.938
Listen, I know some guys
down at the docks.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.073
They'll give us
a good price for it.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.077
We'll both be
25 grand richer,

39:39.110 --> 39:43.882
and this place will turn into
some horrible chain restaurant.

39:43.915 --> 39:48.954
Unless... we were
to pool the money.

39:50.989 --> 39:54.926
And you invest in my restaurant?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.695
No.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.765
So...

39:59.798 --> 40:02.601
you mean... we...

40:02.634 --> 40:04.503
Us.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.505
Together.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.675
Lord have mercy.

40:13.078 --> 40:16.715
CROWD (chanting):
Zo-e! Zo-e! Zo-e! Zo-e!

40:16.748 --> 40:19.651
Zo-e! Zo-e! Zo-e! Zo-e!

40:20.586 --> 40:22.788
(cheering)

40:22.821 --> 40:24.656
Yes!

40:24.690 --> 40:27.559
Okay, you were right--
that does get you drunk

40:27.593 --> 40:28.827
a lot faster.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.662
Let's do it again.
Oh, I wish I could.

40:30.696 --> 40:33.064
I gotta catch a flight
to New York in a few hours.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.800
What?! You're leaving?!

40:34.833 --> 40:36.535
Wuss.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.670
Dr. Wuss of Wuss Medical School.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.672
Sorry.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.608
Come on, walk me to my car.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.643
Okay. Help me.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.113
(crowd whooping)

40:49.247 --> 40:51.016
You know, I'm just
so glad that...

40:51.049 --> 40:52.951
that we didn't have
sex or anything.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.052
I mean, ick, yuck.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.587
Right?
Ooh, I threw up a little.

40:55.621 --> 40:56.922
Super duper yuck.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.791
I'm not so sure you're a
spring break kind of girl

40:59.825 --> 41:01.126
after all, Dr. Hart.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.861
What?! You are so wrong.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.496
Hmm.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.164
Something tells me
you're more of

41:06.197 --> 41:08.934
a take-the-scenic-route,
see-the-ducks kind of girl.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.637
What is that supposed to mean?

41:13.138 --> 41:14.640
Well, have fun, Doc.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.842
There's more foam wrestling
in about ten minutes.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.748
(engine starts)

41:27.919 --> 41:28.987
Hey, Jonah!

41:30.689 --> 41:31.557
Spring break!

41:31.590 --> 41:33.158
(whooping)

41:40.832 --> 41:43.068
Carry on. Nothing to see here.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.871
