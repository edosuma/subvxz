00:52.594 --> 00:55.180
‐ Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! No, pal!

00:55.180 --> 00:57.432
Where are you going?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.642
‐ What's wrong with Thunder?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.728
‐ I don't know! He's trying
to fly up into the clouds!

01:01.728 --> 01:04.356
We can't go up there, buddy!
Someone might see you.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.783
Quick, hide!

01:28.130 --> 01:30.007
That was close. They could've seen us.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.258
‐ Yeah.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.895
Definitely something weird

01:42.895 --> 01:44.980
flying around out there.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.945
Wendy, how many times has Tom
gone through the perimeter sensors?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.405
<i>Nine times.</i>

01:53.405 --> 01:55.449
<i>Ten if you count the sheep diversion.</i>

01:55.449 --> 01:59.578
‐ What are you up to,
Thomas Kullersen?

01:59.578 --> 02:00.579
Hello, <i>mija.</i>

02:00.579 --> 02:02.456
‐ We've got great news!

02:02.456 --> 02:04.750
Well, more of a good news,
bad news thing.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.504
‐ The bad news
is our little earthquake problem
has stopped all work at the station.

02:08.504 --> 02:11.381
The good news is
we've got the evening off!

02:11.381 --> 02:13.634
‐ Yay! And we want you to come along

02:13.634 --> 02:16.261
on an exciting adventure we've planned.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.721
‐ This adventure,

02:17.721 --> 02:20.307
it wouldn't happen
to take place outside,

02:20.307 --> 02:21.558
would it?

02:21.558 --> 02:24.061
‐ Well, yes, but we won't be
doing anything dangerous.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.854
We're just gonna catch fireflies!

02:28.649 --> 02:31.443
Earthquake!
‐ Engage safety protocols!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.996
‐ So, what do you say?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.373
Wanna catch some fireflies?

02:44.373 --> 02:47.084
‐ We're just gonna ignore
that major earthquake?

02:47.543 --> 02:50.838
‐ We've lived in California.
Earthquakes are like rainstorms.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.966
‐ But if you need to talk through your
feelings, we're happy to do that.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.592
On our evening firefly walk?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.929
‐ I <i>feel</i> like I should stay here.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.430
Enjoy your walk.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.727
‐ In case you change your mind.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.571
I just wish she had one good friend.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.383
Alright. To Jun's point,

03:36.383 --> 03:38.468
we gotta be more careful out there.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.054
Keeping the dragons a secret
is the most important thing.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.764
‐ What do you suggest?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.435
‐ Hiding techniques. Watch this.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.811
Okay, pal.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.063
Time for the old
"boom boom goodbye" trick.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.200
‐ Whoa. That was sick!

04:01.200 --> 04:02.618
‐ Where'd he go?

04:02.618 --> 04:03.744
Ah!

04:07.080 --> 04:08.207
‐ Nice one, pal.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.501
See? You just have to train
your dragons to do that.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.337
‐ Yeah, except our dragons
don't breathe lightning.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.302
But we got a few moves of our own.

04:20.302 --> 04:24.806
Behold. The mysterious power
of the ancient water dragon.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.769
Okay, let's try our new
steam cloud getaway trick, remember?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.437
Whoosh!

04:34.399 --> 04:36.777
Yeah, not the way we practiced it.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.198
‐ This is how you go full ninja.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.491
Do what I do, girl.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.119
Hide!

04:47.079 --> 04:49.915
No, no, no! Duck down! Duck down!

04:51.375 --> 04:54.545
‐ Wow. It's like Plowhorn
completely disappeared.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.089
‐ So, we'll practice! And when we're done,

04:57.089 --> 05:01.009
our dragons will be
the best hiders in all of dragon‐kind.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.097
‐ Tom?

05:05.597 --> 05:08.559
Tom, where are you? Okay, okay.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.061
I got this. Mm‐hmm.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.313
Tom? Tom!

05:13.313 --> 05:15.983
Where are you?
Someone's here.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.026
Let's go check it out.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.040
No way! It's Alex!

05:32.040 --> 05:35.043
‐ I thought she never left her room.
What is she doing out here?

05:44.887 --> 05:46.555
‐
She's about to discover the lair.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.516
‐ Maybe we just tell her the truth.
Let her into Dragon Club.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.269
‐ Dragon Club isn't looking
for new members, Jun.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.855
If a lot of people know,
it's not really a secret.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.441
‐ Uh, yeah. That's how secrets work.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.651
‐ Says the kid who told
his parents everything.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.654
‐ But fortunately for us,
my parents think I'm insane.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.489
‐ Uh, guys?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.952
‐ Code red.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.579
Tom?

06:13.332 --> 06:15.542
Uh, Tom?

06:15.542 --> 06:18.003
You in there? Hello?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.464
Hello?

06:20.464 --> 06:23.091
My little toaster tracker
says you're down there.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.845
Of course he's not in there.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.264
This is silly. I... I'm going home.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.725
Ah!

06:31.725 --> 06:33.227
Um, hm...

06:37.481 --> 06:40.400
Okay then...

06:47.115 --> 06:49.701
‐ Well, looks like she might
be part of Dragon Club

06:49.701 --> 06:52.204
whether we like it or not.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.956
‐ Let's get the dragons back in the lair,

06:53.956 --> 06:56.250
then we'll deal with Alex.

07:06.385 --> 07:09.513
‐ You're safe. Obviously,
you're having a lucid dream.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.557
You never even went outside.

07:11.557 --> 07:14.184
You've been here the whole time,
safely in your dome.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.479
Ah! Also part of the dream.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.025
Ah!

07:29.283 --> 07:31.994
Just the wind.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.331
Ah!

07:38.083 --> 07:41.420
Hello?

07:44.423 --> 07:45.966
‐ Moms?

07:47.843 --> 07:48.969
<i>Mamas?</i>

08:02.065 --> 08:04.526
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just breathe, Alex.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.987
You're fine. In fact,
you're probably just overly tired.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.865
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's it. Too much fresh air.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.116
Let's just go to bed!

08:14.536 --> 08:15.996
Uh, lights off, Wendy!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.372
<i>Good night, Alex.</i>

08:26.423 --> 08:28.884
‐ This is my safe space. This is
my safe space. This is my‐‐

08:30.177 --> 08:32.179
Wait a second.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.097
This is all Tom, I bet.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.183
Some kind of twisted prank.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.060
Oh, Kullersen, you better‐‐

08:42.481 --> 08:45.776
It's real! It's real!
It's definitely real!

08:49.321 --> 08:51.573
‐ Uh, hey, Alex!
Sorry for just dropping in like this,

08:51.573 --> 08:54.284
but you wouldn't believe
what we saw in the woods.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.287
‐ Yeah! A bunch of weirdo mountain kids

08:57.287 --> 08:59.164
wearing silly costumes!

08:59.164 --> 09:01.166
Teenagers, am I right?

09:01.583 --> 09:04.837
‐ What are you people talking about?
Those aren't teenagers!

09:04.837 --> 09:08.131
Those are monsters!
A‐and there's one in my bedroom!

09:11.593 --> 09:13.679
Alex, there's nothing there.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.223
‐ Are you feeling okay?
‐ Can I get you some water?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.141
‐ No, I don't need water!

09:18.141 --> 09:21.019
And no, I'm not feeling okay! Okay?

09:21.019 --> 09:24.231
This thing has feathers
and a beak and it can turn invisible.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.608
‐ Turn invisible? That's crazy!

09:26.608 --> 09:28.902
‐ Dragons don't have feathers.

09:30.779 --> 09:34.408
‐ Wait, what? Who's talking about dragons?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.368
Ah!

09:36.368 --> 09:38.078
‐ Thunder, no! Go away! Go away!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.000
‐ Ah!

09:44.376 --> 09:45.627
Ah! Oh!

09:52.801 --> 09:55.888
It is an invisible dragon.
‐ What's it doing in here?

09:55.888 --> 09:57.639
‐ Listen, I don't know
what you're talking about,

09:57.639 --> 10:00.976
but I want you to get
this thing out <i>right now</i>!

10:00.976 --> 10:02.978
‐ Wait! Shh!

10:02.978 --> 10:04.479
You hear that?

10:04.897 --> 10:07.524
‐ Oh no, it's your moms!
‐ Moms!

10:07.524 --> 10:11.278
‐ No, Alex, wait! The dragons are
a secret. We can't tell anyone.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.488
Just like CinnaBot538 is a secret.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.450
‐ If people knew about the dragons,
it would put them in danger.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.784
‐ Can we trust you?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.412
‐ Sweetie? You change your mind?

10:20.412 --> 10:23.540
Alex!
‐ I can't believe it!

10:26.043 --> 10:27.711
‐ You have friends over!

10:28.212 --> 10:30.839
‐ Uh, yeah! Yeah, it‐it's a movie party.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.508
Right, Alex?

10:36.053 --> 10:38.722
‐ Right. Movie party.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.350
‐ Ooh! You kids just sit right here.

10:42.809 --> 10:47.147
‐ No cinematic bonding experience
would be complete without salty treats!

10:50.817 --> 10:52.611
‐ We get all sorts of
movies on this thing!

10:52.611 --> 10:54.821
Action, comedy, fantasy, ooh!

10:54.821 --> 10:56.240
How about a monster movie?

10:56.240 --> 10:59.076
‐ Yeah. That's appropriate.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.291
‐ Huh.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.214
Hm...

11:12.214 --> 11:15.050
Our microwave appears
to be malfunctioning.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.885
No telling what's wrong with this thing.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.512
I'm sure Alex can fix it.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.809
‐ Thanks. Who doesn't
love hot buttery popcorn?

11:26.812 --> 11:29.398
‐ Wow, D'Angelo!
You must've been hungry.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.484
‐ I'm still hungry, actually.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.069
Yep.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.700
‐ Is everything okay?

11:41.827 --> 11:44.496
‐ What could possibly be the problem?

11:44.496 --> 11:47.708
‐ Perhaps, we're "cramping" Alex's style.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.918
‐ Of course. Let's get outta here.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.087
‐ Please, enjoy the show.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.964
‐ We're off to catch more fireflies!

11:58.927 --> 12:02.431
‐ Hey there, little mimic dragon.
You wanna be friends?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.105
‐ My turn. Come here, you little copycat!

12:26.955 --> 12:29.124
‐ This isn't working.
We're only scaring it.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.417
‐ And me!

12:30.417 --> 12:32.878
This is why I never go outside

12:32.878 --> 12:35.506
because terrible things like
this can follow me home!

12:37.674 --> 12:40.802
Ah! No, no, no! No, no!

12:41.261 --> 12:43.805
Get away! Get away!

12:43.805 --> 12:45.182
‐ Ah!

12:47.059 --> 12:50.020
‐ Maybe we should wait outside.
Too many cooks in the kitchenette.

12:50.020 --> 12:53.732
You're right. Call if you need us.
Wait, Alex.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.652
Can you stay? There's a reason
this dragon followed you home.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.987
‐ Why? What does it want with me?

12:58.987 --> 13:01.365
‐ I don't know.
Maybe it saw us with our dragons,

13:01.365 --> 13:02.908
and you were all alone,

13:02.908 --> 13:04.826
and it's curious about you.
Wait,

13:04.826 --> 13:07.496
you each have your own dragon?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.830
‐ Yeah.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.874
Yeah, they‐they sorta bonded with us,

13:10.874 --> 13:13.585
and I think this one
wants to bond with you.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.588
So, let's just sit down
and make ourselves small.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.134
‐ I‐I don't know.
I'm not comfortable with animals.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.387
I‐I prefer tech that
does what I tell it to do.

13:23.387 --> 13:26.598
Animals, they're unpredictable,
and, you know,

13:26.598 --> 13:28.475
sometimes really, really mean.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.645
This one time,

13:31.645 --> 13:34.064
this really big dog

13:34.064 --> 13:36.024
followed me home.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.485
And everyone was saying,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.195
"It likes you. It likes you.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.448
You should pet it," and so I did.

13:43.448 --> 13:46.243
I did pet it, and it bit me.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.120
It bit me so hard.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.955
And‐and then it growled,

13:49.955 --> 13:52.207
and it‐‐ and it chased me.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.460
So now, I don't go outside,

13:55.460 --> 13:58.213
and nothing ever follows me home.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.842
O‐or didn't.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.512
This is why I don't listen to people
when they tell me it's safe outside

14:05.512 --> 14:08.473
because it is not safe outside!

14:08.473 --> 14:10.475
‐ No. Not always.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.770
Sometimes, the world outside is scary,

14:13.770 --> 14:16.148
but sometimes, it's amazing.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.900
And fantastic and...

14:17.900 --> 14:19.443
and worth taking a risk for.

14:19.443 --> 14:23.572
‐ Yeah, but... but you don't know that
<i>this</i> is amazing.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.699
‐ No. No, I don't.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.701
There are never any guarantees,

14:27.701 --> 14:29.703
so I leave it for you to decide.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.706
But dragons aren't big dogs.
They're something unique.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.458
And I don't think this one
would've followed you home

14:34.458 --> 14:36.543
if she hadn't already
connected with you in some way.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.880
‐ So, you're saying that
all your dragons are nice?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.173
‐ Oh yeah.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.843
They're our friends,
and that's why we keep them a secret.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.136
Because a real dragon...

14:47.262 --> 14:49.515
‐ Would end up a dead dragon.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.686
‐ Lemme try something.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.815
Huh. The hand thing usually works.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.734
‐ Hand thing?
‐ Well, if they accept you,

15:00.734 --> 15:02.736
they press their noses into your hands.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.030
‐ Well, you <i>have</i> been chasing her around,

15:05.030 --> 15:06.782
trying to tackle her,

15:06.782 --> 15:09.910
and you said she bonded with <i>me</i>.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.664
Probably. Maybe.

15:14.373 --> 15:18.502
You're sure i‐it's
not a mean one, right?

15:18.502 --> 15:20.712
‐ I've told you all I know.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.339
It's your choice now.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.009
‐ Okay...

15:34.059 --> 15:36.478
Whoa!

15:36.478 --> 15:38.981
She's beautiful.

15:40.399 --> 15:43.402
She looks a little like Quetzalcoatl.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.695
‐ Quetzal‐who‐now?

15:44.695 --> 15:46.613
‐ The feathered serpent.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.199
My <i>abuelita</i> used to
tell me bedtime stories

15:49.199 --> 15:52.619
about how wise Quetzalcoatl was.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.831
Legend says that the serpent
was the forefathers

15:55.831 --> 15:58.500
of all Meso‐Americans.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.795
‐ I guess that would make you
and this dragon family.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.006
You might even say it was
her destiny to bond with you.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.434
‐ It ate her, didn't it?
Oh, I knew it!

16:15.434 --> 16:16.685
‐ No. Everything's fine,

16:16.685 --> 16:19.313
but we gotta get this dragon out of town
before someone spots her.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.647
‐ Everyone stay back.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.567
She got a little too excited,
and she needs her space right now.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.860
And so do I.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.619
‐ Okay. Let's get to the lair
without being seen.

16:33.619 --> 16:34.620
Ah!

16:35.370 --> 16:36.830
What are you guys doing here?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.582
‐ We told you to stay in the cave!

16:38.582 --> 16:41.585
‐ Man! Does <i>nobody</i> respect
the rules anymore?

16:45.881 --> 16:48.133
‐ Look, we gotta fly out of here now.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.719
‐ No, no, no. I am <i>not</i> flying.

16:50.719 --> 16:54.473
I'm more of the "stay on the ground,
walk on two legs" type.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.853
‐ Uh‐oh. That's the ICARIS
emergency messaging system.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.439
<i>‐ Chief Baker here with a safety alert.</i>

17:02.439 --> 17:04.483
<i>Due to increased earthquake activity,</i>

17:04.483 --> 17:06.485
<i>we are implementing a new security system.</i>

17:07.694 --> 17:09.613
<i>Motion‐activated spotlights</i>

17:09.613 --> 17:12.241
<i>to help you all safely
navigate home after dark.</i>

17:12.241 --> 17:14.034
<i>Didn't want them to surprise you.</i>

17:14.034 --> 17:15.827
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

17:19.623 --> 17:20.999
‐ Piece of cake.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.168
Thunder, we need cover. Lights out.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.763
‐ And the hits just keep on coming.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.020
‐ Okay, everyone. Keep moving.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.273
‐ Hold it. Someone's coming.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.733
‐
We're surrounded.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.742
‐ Keep going. Wu, Wei,
and I will slow them down.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.745
Alright, you two. Steam cloud getaway.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.290
But, do it like
we practiced this time, okay?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.424
‐ Where did all this come from?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.111
‐ I got this. Follow me.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.619
Oh!

18:38.619 --> 18:39.870
‐ Who's out there?

18:39.870 --> 18:42.247
‐ It's my Pops! Move out! Go!

18:44.416 --> 18:47.544
Plow, no! You need to hide!

18:47.544 --> 18:49.421
Hide!

18:51.757 --> 18:54.301
‐ Come on out! I know you're there!

18:54.301 --> 18:56.678
You can't hide!

18:56.678 --> 18:58.514
I will find you.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.192
Huh?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.196
What is going on around here?

19:18.283 --> 19:20.577
Oh no, not you.

19:21.787 --> 19:22.329
‐ Tom!

19:23.080 --> 19:25.123
‐ Hear that? Came from over there.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.626
Chief, we got someone moving
around in sector five.

19:27.626 --> 19:28.836
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

19:29.378 --> 19:30.796
‐ Alex, run!

19:35.592 --> 19:37.553
Thunder, light him up.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.726
‐ Chief!

19:56.864 --> 19:59.241
‐ Ah! No, no, no, wait, wait,
wait! Where are you going?

20:03.495 --> 20:05.831
Ah! The fireflies. That means...

20:06.874 --> 20:08.125
Moms.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.173
Oh, that's not good.
‐ What do we do?

20:14.173 --> 20:15.424
There's nothing we can do.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.092
Alex can handle this on her own.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.428
Welcome to Dragon Club.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.805
‐ No, wait!
Please, stop!

20:23.599 --> 20:26.602
We can't let my moms see you!

20:26.602 --> 20:29.688
Please! You have to... hide!

20:29.688 --> 20:31.523
Ah! Ah!

20:32.858 --> 20:35.110
No, no, no! You don't understand!

20:35.110 --> 20:37.696
The world is a dangerous place for us!

20:44.828 --> 20:46.538
Aw...

20:46.538 --> 20:49.917
You're trying to help me calm down.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.710
‐ Calm down.

20:52.461 --> 20:54.630
‐ Okay,

20:54.630 --> 20:56.548
if you insist.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.759
I know you don't understand me,

20:58.759 --> 21:01.386
but you <i>understand</i> me.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.890
Ah, such a beautiful night.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.392
‐ Glorious. Too bad Alex missed it.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.478
‐ Please hide!

21:11.188 --> 21:12.481
Ooh! There.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.488
Got it!

21:20.989 --> 21:22.866
Okay, now we can go home.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.709
Told you she could handle it.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.175
‐ Wow, that dragon is really
coming out of her shell.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.052
‐ And so is Alex.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.930
‐ I'm gonna call you Feathers

21:44.930 --> 21:47.015
because of your beautiful plumage.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.017
So, now you got a name,

21:49.017 --> 21:51.895
and we gotta get you caught up
with the other dragons,

21:51.895 --> 21:54.773
so let's practice a hiding technique.

21:54.773 --> 21:56.817
Feathers, hide.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.279
Feathers, hide.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.989
‐ Feathers, hide.

22:01.989 --> 22:03.240
‐ No, wait!

22:03.240 --> 22:05.784
No, Feathers! Personal space!

22:05.784 --> 22:07.870
That tickles.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.998
‐ Looks like we're building
a nice little family here, huh?

22:13.792 --> 22:16.003
That's what you were
looking for earlier, wasn't it?

22:16.003 --> 22:17.963
When you flew up
toward the lightning storm?

22:17.963 --> 22:19.548
Other dragons like you?

22:19.548 --> 22:21.175
We'll keep looking, okay?

22:21.175 --> 22:23.010
I'm sure they're out there somewhere, pal.
