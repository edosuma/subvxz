WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:03.461
So, we all need
to be prepared.

00:03.461 --> 00:04.796
You want to find
a safe place

00:04.796 --> 00:06.548
and establish
a defensive perimeter.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.674
Like in the basement?

00:07.716 --> 00:10.343
No! You never go
in the basement!

00:10.343 --> 00:14.681
It's just our bi-monthly Zombie
Apocalypse Preparedness lecture.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.308
Yeah. You're welcome
to join us.

00:16.308 --> 00:20.812
Please, Phineas. There's nothing
about zombies that I don't know.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.731
Did you know there's
one standing behind you?

00:22.731 --> 00:23.732
(SCREAMS)

00:25.483 --> 00:27.694
Very funny.
Ha! Good one, bro.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.487
Phineas,
Pinky's missing.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.864
Oh, that's too
bad, Isabella.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.450
Chihuahuas. That's the first
thing zombies go for.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.868
Uh, we've moved
past zombies, Buford.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.703
He's been gone
all morning!

00:36.745 --> 00:39.456
He didn't even touch his breakfast burrito!
What am I going to do?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.625
We could put up posters.
We could do nothing.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.877
We could make a portable
positronic canine detector

00:43.877 --> 00:46.588
using the olfactory receptors
that Ferb and I were gonna use

00:46.588 --> 00:49.007
for our milligram-scale
purification study.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.384
Let's do that one.
You kids have fun.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.721
But I have a lunch date with
Jeremy down at City Hall.

00:54.763 --> 00:55.889
City Hall
serves lunch?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.516
I thought they only
served subpoenas.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.645
Oh, come on! What's a guy got to
do to get a rimshot around here?

01:01.645 --> 01:03.521
(FRUSTRATED SIGH)

01:03.521 --> 01:05.272
For your information, I'm
going down to City Hall

01:05.272 --> 01:07.734
because Jeremy's working in the
Slushy Dawg concession stand

01:07.734 --> 01:11.238
at the food court there and we're
gonna have lunch together.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.405
But don't worry,
Isabella,

01:12.405 --> 01:13.865
lam sure Pinky
will turn up.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.910
Perry always does. Speaking
of which, where is Perry?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.370
And where's Pinky?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.746
And where's that
breakfast burrito?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.789
(DRUM ROLL)

01:20.789 --> 01:22.916
Ha! There's my guy!

01:22.916 --> 01:25.794
<i>Ah, Agent P. I believe
you know Agent Pinky.</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:28.755
<i>Agent Pinky informs us that
D001' intends to steal the deed</i>

01:28.797 --> 01:31.675
<i>to the Tri-State Area
from the City Hall archives.</i>

01:31.675 --> 01:34.427
<i>It seems he's discovered
that whoever has the deed</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:36.554
<i>automatically
becomes the ruler.</i>

01:36.554 --> 01:38.807
<i>It's on old low
from o simpler time.</i>

01:38.807 --> 01:41.559
<i>You'll find that Agent Pinky
is quite on asset, Agent P.</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:44.771
<i>He's good with computers, covert ops,
and quite frankly, he needs the hours.</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:47.774
<i>So get out there
and stop Doofenshmirtz!</i>

01:47.816 --> 01:50.777
<i>Good luck, Agents P and, uh, P.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:54.322
I guess you're just two peas in a pod.
(CHUCKLES)

01:54.322 --> 01:57.575
Carl, where's my rimshot? CARL:
It's right in front of you.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.453
How did you do that?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.790
Now I am here, but the best
way to the food court is...

02:03.832 --> 02:06.835
ls by taking the mandatory
City Hall tour! But...

02:06.835 --> 02:09.963
Wouldn't want a bunch of uninformed
people wandering around City Hall.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.716
I've been on this tour
since this morning

02:12.716 --> 02:14.718
and I've been caught
trying to escape twice!

02:14.718 --> 02:16.720
No talking back there.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.848
Now follow me to a world of
bureaucratic action and adventure!

02:31.568 --> 02:32.986
Perry the Platypus?
No way!

02:32.986 --> 02:34.112
What a coincidence!

02:34.112 --> 02:35.739
Excuse me.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.741
If you and your mullet will
take one step to the...

02:37.741 --> 02:39.367
Thank you.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.704
Oh, look, you brought your
little dog, too! How cute.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.623
Oh, FYI, I don't think
they allow dogs in here,

02:45.623 --> 02:47.625
so, you know,
watch out for that.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.337
Anyway, I bet you're wondering
why I'm in City Hall, right?

02:50.337 --> 02:54.382
Well, I plan to go down into the secret
City Hall vault and steal the...

02:54.382 --> 02:55.842
Oh, you, you knew
that, right? (HUFFS)

02:55.884 --> 02:59.095
'cause that's probably why
you're here, to stop me, right?

02:59.095 --> 03:01.765
What you probably
don't know is how

03:01.765 --> 03:03.892
I will get into the vault
without being noticed.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.643
Behold!

03:05.643 --> 03:07.604
My Blend-into-
the-Background-inator.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.856
I will be able to search out
and steal the hidden deed

03:09.856 --> 03:14.652
because, like they say, it's easier to find
a hidden object when you're hidden as well.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.781
What? (STAMMERS) That's a thing.
They say that.

03:17.781 --> 03:21.034
Anyway, I place the lnator
on my head, like so,

03:21.034 --> 03:24.037
I press this button and I,
I'm here, and I'm blended in.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.623
I'm here, I'm gone,
I'm here, I'm <i>go...</i>

03:26.623 --> 03:28.500
Oh, my head!
(STUTTERS)

03:28.500 --> 03:30.752
I hope there's no long
term damage from this,

03:30.752 --> 03:35.048
but, ugh... Anyway, I'll bet you think
I forgot to trap you. Well, surprise!

03:35.048 --> 03:36.883
You're already trapped!

03:37.634 --> 03:42.138
You see, you don't have a
number, Perry the Platypus.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.642
So by the time you and your
little dog get into the archives,

03:45.642 --> 03:50.522
I will already be ruler
of the Tri-State Area!

03:51.564 --> 03:53.566
(LAUGHING)

03:59.697 --> 04:02.409
I'm sorry, you cannot go in
there without a number, sir.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.036
Oh, please don't tell me
you brought your dog.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.206
Behold! The Dog
Sensomatic Helmet!

04:08.206 --> 04:11.793
It will amplify Buford's
senses to those of a dog!

04:11.793 --> 04:13.586
Okay, Buford, uh,
what do you smell now?

04:13.586 --> 04:14.963
I think I can smell
the future.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.172
It's working!

04:16.172 --> 04:17.464
Do you smell
Pinky yet?

04:17.464 --> 04:19.426
I smell something.
(SNIFFING)

04:19.426 --> 04:22.095
I smell... (SNIFFING)
I smell bacon!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.180
ISABELLA AND BALJEET: No, Buford, wait!
PHINEAS: Uh-oh!

04:24.180 --> 04:25.723
Now this is
a very old painting

04:25.723 --> 04:28.476
depicting John P. Tri-State
and Otto H. Adjacent...

04:28.476 --> 04:30.687
Excuse me, I just need to
get to the food court.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.565
Please hold all your questions
till the end, those are the rules.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.983
And also, please refrain
from gum chewing,

04:34.983 --> 04:38.736
Also, there are no cutsies,
or halfsies for funsies.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.739
And absolutely no crossing
the stanchions, please!

04:41.739 --> 04:43.867
<i>No cruzor la cuerdo,
porfovor!</i>

04:44.993 --> 04:46.870
To the basement!

04:49.122 --> 04:52.625
(LAUGHS)
Quit it! Fresh!

04:52.625 --> 04:54.752
All right, let's see...
"Garage, basement,

04:54.752 --> 04:57.589
"catacombs, pessimistic humanoid
underground dwellings..."

04:57.589 --> 05:00.842
Ah! Here it is! "Gift
Shop and Secret Vault!"

05:03.887 --> 05:05.763
Who's a good boy?
It's me, right?

05:05.763 --> 05:07.557
Who's a good boy? You're a good boy!
You mean me, right?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.100
Yes, you are! Yes, you are!
lsabefla?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.852
How does this help us
with Pinky?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.729
Easy. I've been rubbing his
belly with Pinky's squeak toy.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.980
Now he's got the scent!

05:13.980 --> 05:15.815
He's this way!
I can smell it!

05:15.815 --> 05:17.859
Good boy! Yeah, I'm
a good boy, right?

05:17.859 --> 05:19.235
Yes, you are!
Huh?

05:19.235 --> 05:20.737
Oh, that had better
not be the mailman.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.947
No, Buford, you're supposed
to be finding Pinky!

05:23.740 --> 05:25.742
(GRUNTS)

05:25.742 --> 05:28.495
(GROANS) What kind of elevator
falls at the speed of gravity?

05:28.495 --> 05:30.079
Why did they even
put an elevator there?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.123
I could just jump down the shaft or...
(GASPS)

05:32.123 --> 05:34.626
The deed!
Well, I guess it's not...

05:34.626 --> 05:36.961
Not all that
hidden then, is it?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.506
Or maybe it's just easier
to find 'cause I'm hidden!

05:39.506 --> 05:41.716
Yes! I knew that
was a real saying!

05:41.716 --> 05:43.009
Come to papa!

05:44.594 --> 05:47.096
Perry the Platypus?
Oh, and your pet dog?

05:47.096 --> 05:50.099
How did you escape the
clutches of bureaucracy?

05:50.099 --> 05:51.851
(STUTTERS)
Oh, you took a number.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.645
I guess the line wasn't
as long aslthought

05:53.645 --> 05:58.024
Once I get outside,
I will own the Tri-State Area!

05:59.526 --> 06:00.652
Wait! Which one is it?

06:00.652 --> 06:03.154
Oh, great!
Now I'm confused!

06:03.154 --> 06:05.782
And over here are the spontaneous
musical number dioramas.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.035
The huh? Ooh, Danville is known for
its spontaneous musical numbers.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.662

to be fine-tuned.

is offline

little dog friend can do about it.
