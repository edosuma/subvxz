00:01.935 --> 00:05.537
[ Dennis ] You better have
a good reason for getting us
out of bed this early, jerk.

00:05.539 --> 00:10.275
I got a goddamn great reason
for getting you out of bed.
This bar is hemorrhaging money.

00:10.277 --> 00:13.045
You gotta spend money
to make money.
Economics 101, dude.

00:13.047 --> 00:17.316
You're bleeding us to death,
especially with that
company credit card you got.

00:17.318 --> 00:21.353
That is for business expenses,
Frank. Everything on there
is a business expense.

00:21.355 --> 00:25.357
Who spent $500
for laser hair removal?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.126
Right over here, slick.
Don't wanna have
hair down there.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.961
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.096
Who spent $5,000
for a samurai sword?

00:31.098 --> 00:34.266
Your head of security.
Yeah. Just wait till he saves
your life one day with it.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.068
$6,000 on a camcorder.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.703
Well, I've decided
what I'm gonna do...

00:37.705 --> 00:39.571
is I'm going to take all those
hilarious characters...

00:39.573 --> 00:41.473
that I've been creating
over the past several years--

00:41.475 --> 00:44.309
I'm gonna put 'em on tape.
I'm gonna put 'em on YouTube.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.945
That way I can get discovered by
a casting director or producer,

00:46.947 --> 00:48.747
get some kind of
a TV development deal.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.583
Yeah, right. So the point is,
Frank, is that these
are all business expenses.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.485
See?
I mean, some are definitely
more realistic than others.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.454
Yeah, not that one.
No, not at all.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.123
But nonetheless, it was,
I believe, bought as
a business expense, so--

00:58.125 --> 01:01.794
They're not business expenses.
What I bought
is a business expense.

01:01.796 --> 01:04.663
What I bought is something
that's gonna save our asses.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.299
Okay. Yeah. All right.
All right. What'd you get?

01:07.301 --> 01:09.535
I bought a billboard.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.737
Okay, so I'm thinking
we write on the billboard
in nice big letters,

01:45.739 --> 01:48.874
"We have two for one
drink specials on Thursdays."

01:48.876 --> 01:51.844
And on the bottom, you got
a hilarious picture of Greenman
kicking someone in the nuts.

01:51.846 --> 01:55.080
And people go,
"Hey, what's this wacky place?
Where can I have those drinks?"

01:55.082 --> 01:58.417
It is absolutely astonishing
how bad your ideas are.
How is that a bad idea?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.519
Go sit down.
The adults are working.
Really?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.721
Okay.
When we need a child,
we'll call you.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.157
- Woo-hoo!
- Now, Dennis,
you and I on the same team--

02:05.159 --> 02:07.259
hot chick up on the billboard,
sex sells, boom.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.094
Oh, absolutely.
It's Advertising 101.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.729
Long legs, taut breasts
and tight poopers.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.598
I'm just gonna jump in here
real quick and point out...

02:12.600 --> 02:14.299
that this is the point
in the conversation...

02:14.301 --> 02:16.268
where I would volunteer
to be the girl on the billboard,

02:16.270 --> 02:18.437
and then you guys would talk
about how ugly you think I am...

02:18.439 --> 02:21.440
- and compare me
to some sort of giant bird.
- You look so much like a bird.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.842
Dennis, I was
thinking fish recently.
Really?

02:23.844 --> 02:26.411
Yeah. Her eyes are
so far apart, they're, like,
on the sides of her head.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.046
Okay. Okay.
But I don't wanna be
on your billboard.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.716
I'm not gonna ask to be
because you wouldn't
let me be on it anyway.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.551
That's sensible
of you not to ask.
[ Mac ] God, no.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.454
For the love of God,
there's no way you would be
up on that billboard.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.523
- That is never gonna happen!
- Let me get the point out!

02:37.525 --> 02:39.491
The point is--
Anything's better than you.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.493
I don't wanna be
on your billboard,
and I'll tell you why.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.995
I'm gonna take
one of my characters,

02:42.997 --> 02:46.365
and I'm gonna launch
a viral video
and promote Paddy's myself.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.500
A viral video?
There's about a billion
of those on YouTube.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.703
- Who gives a shit, Dee?
- Oh, you think anybody gives
a shit about a billboard?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.305
Uh, wake up, donkeys.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.974
The Internet is where it's at,
and I'm going to be
an Internet sensation.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.944
You know, you're totally right.
And if you don't mind,
I'm gonna come with you.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.214
Maybe I can throw Greenman
into a couple of your videos,
you know, and work it out.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.750
That'll get a lot
of hits, I think.
You can help me out, Charlie,

03:04.752 --> 03:07.352
but we're not gonna put
Greenman into anything.
Well, we'll see about that.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.054
We won't see about that.
Well, we will.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.789
Mm-mmm.
All right.
Uh, later, dudes.

03:10.791 --> 03:14.960
S.U. in your A's,
don't wear a "C"
and "J" all over your B's.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.995
Why would he not wear a "C"?

03:16.997 --> 03:19.464
I don't even know
what he's talking about
half the time, bro.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.033
[ Mac ]
Hey, Frank.
Glad you're here, bro.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.101
We're talkin' billboard ideas.
Yeah.

03:23.103 --> 03:26.205
Don't waste your time.
I know what the billboard's
gonna look like already.

03:26.207 --> 03:30.042
Two gorgeous girls up there,
giant cans,

03:30.044 --> 03:31.710
me in the middle
with my thumbs up.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.545
- Yeah!
- Well, that's just simply
not gonna happen.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.714
Uh, actually,
maybe Frank has a point, dude.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.383
Maybe we should
put a dude up there.
Certainly not him.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.253
But if we put
some hot beefcake up there,
maybe it'll attract more chicks.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.721
Yeah, that's a good point.
Okay, I like that.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.656
You know what?
Let's slap my picture up there.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.925
It's about time
I got my modeling career
off the ground anyway.

03:46.927 --> 03:50.062
Don't flatter yourself.
You're not gonna
be up there...

03:50.064 --> 03:53.198
because I am gonna be
the face of Paddy's Bar.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.767
That's ridiculous, Frank.
You're, um,

03:55.769 --> 03:57.002
ugly.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.238
- What?
- Ugly.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.672
- I'm ugly?
- Yeah.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.809
With that anteater nose,
you're telling me I'm ugly?

04:03.811 --> 04:07.813
My nose was chiseled
by the gods themselves,
Frank.

04:07.815 --> 04:11.850
My body was sculpted
to the proportions
of Michelangelo's David.

04:11.852 --> 04:16.188
You, on the other hand--
well, you're a pit of despair.

04:16.190 --> 04:19.258
Frank, you disgust me.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.627
You disgust everyone.

04:21.629 --> 04:26.865
And you will never, ever,
be on that billboard.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.874
[ Irish Accent ]
Good morning, Philadelphia.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.578
I'm Crazy Paddy,
and I'm coming to you
from Paddy's Pub,

04:39.580 --> 04:43.482
telling you to come on down,
where we're
slashing prices so low,

04:43.484 --> 04:45.684
you won't need a pot of gold
to get sloppy.

04:45.686 --> 04:50.322
So come on down to Paddy's.
It's insane!

04:50.324 --> 04:52.157
What is that?
[ No Accent ]
Did you like that?

04:52.159 --> 04:54.960
No. That's not what
YouTube videos are like.
Oh, that's a great character.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.196
No, that's a bad commercial
you'd see on the
cable network or something.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.932
Maybe you didn't get it.
I'm crazy 'cause I'm pricing
the beer too low.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.569
Mmm, I think I got it.
The beer's too low for what
average beer prices should be.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.973
You know what? Let's just do it
again. Maybe throw in some more
jokes or something. You know?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.309
Make it a little funnier.
Make it funnier.
You're absolutely right.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.810
You can make it funny.
You're a funny girl.

05:11.812 --> 05:16.214

Why?
Now that was funny!
Dee, that's awesome.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.224
Why would you do that?
That's what
YouTube video is.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.694
Are you insane?
You ever see the little girl
who's mashing the grapes...

05:28.696 --> 05:31.330
and then slips
and she's, like--
Why would you do that, Charlie?

05:31.332 --> 05:33.532
That's what
people wanna see!
Oh, my God!

05:33.534 --> 05:37.336
People getting injured
or seriously hurt--
That's funny!

Okay?
Let's just do this.
This is--

05:39.707 --> 05:42.040

what gets hits on YouTube.

You're flinching
every time now.
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.590
I can't concentrate
when I'm about to get
blasted in the face with a ball!

05:58.592 --> 06:00.525
I'll blast you all over
if you flinch again.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.394

I don't like it, Charlie!
I don't think it's funny--

06:09.269 --> 06:10.769
Yeah!
It's too much.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.604
It's too much.
It just hurts too bad.

Bro, can you believe
how many hot chicks showed up...

06:19.613 --> 06:21.580
for a casting call
for a billboard?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.315
How have we not
done this before?
Yeah. Yeah, man.

Oh! It's gonna be
so perfect.

Let's go. Just take
your places over there.

- Frank, what are you doing?
- We're lookin'
for models, right?

06:32.860 --> 06:35.827
Yeah.
I went on a stud hunt.
I came back with beefcakes.

Uh, Rex. Rex.
Here you go.

What's Rex for?
We don't need Rex.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.604
Take your shirt off.
Come on. You don't need
to take your shirt off.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.072
- [ Whistles ]
- Okay. Well, if you're
looking for that.

- [ Cackles ]
Now that--
- That's what you want.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.909
That is what
you call stallion.
[ Mac ] That is a stallion.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.512
I didn't know you guys
were lookin' for a stallion.
I'm a stallion--

06:53.514 --> 06:55.380
Ooh! Dennis.
Uh-- [ Groans ]

06:55.382 --> 06:56.915
You think Frank's
got a point here?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.017
I don't think he has a point.
I'm a stallion.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.486
Uh--
[ Groaning ]

07:01.488 --> 07:04.856
All right. This is messy.
Um, look, buddy.

07:04.858 --> 07:08.093
2003 Dennis--
Okay, he was Grade "A"
prime beefcake.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.162
No one is disputing that.
He was a stallion.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.764
But 2008 Dennis is in decline.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.268
Take a look at Rex here.
That is a body
that just won't quit.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.738
I bet if you pop those pants
off, you're gonna find a bird
that just won't quit either,

07:19.740 --> 07:21.973
and I think that'll
come in handy in this situation.

07:21.975 --> 07:26.578
I think the problem here
is that your body quit.
Your bird quit.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.547
And unfortunately,
it's no longer legit.

talking about? My bird?
