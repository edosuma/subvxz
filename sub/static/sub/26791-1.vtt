this goddamn forest.

38:50.636 --> 38:52.371
They'll probably be here
by morning.

38:55.906 --> 38:57.343
Now listen up. [SIGHS]

38:57.843 --> 39:01.411
There is a, uh, petrol
station about a thousand yards

39:01.413 --> 39:02.481
in from the line.

39:02.881 --> 39:05.216
It's not much, but enough
to fuel German light armor,

39:05.683 --> 39:07.886
and give them Krauts
a jumping off point.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.756
If we gear up right now,
and I do mean right now,

39:12.457 --> 39:13.625

39:15.727 --> 39:17.696
we might be able to get
some of 'em out of here

39:18.096 --> 39:19.331
before the attack.

39:20.198 --> 39:22.033
- GREGORY: Colonel?
- Sergeant?

39:23.736 --> 39:25.335
We only got a few rangers
left,

39:25.337 --> 39:27.937
but... I'm thinking maybe we
can contribute a bit more

39:27.939 --> 39:29.274
given the current situation.

39:32.544 --> 39:33.745
Explain, Sergeant.

39:34.645 --> 39:36.348
What I mean to say, sir,
is that...

39:38.149 --> 39:40.017
me and the boys,
we head in them forests,

39:40.886 --> 39:42.621
and we take out
that petrol station.

39:44.589 --> 39:46.257
You know, put a hitch
in them Kraut's step.

39:46.725 --> 39:50.426
If we do that, maybe we buy
these nurses and the wounded

39:50.428 --> 39:52.629
some more time.

39:52.631 --> 39:55.433
There's a thousand
yards of forest to cross.

39:58.236 --> 40:01.006
And most likely, an MG nest
and a sniper or two.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.279
Are you Irish, Sergeant?

40:09.747 --> 40:10.682
No, sir.

you're referring we're needing,

40:22.893 --> 40:24.430
How many men you got left, son?

40:24.897 --> 40:26.332
I got three rangers, colonel.

40:27.732 --> 40:29.167
More than enough
to get the job done.

40:33.937 --> 40:35.240
Well there's your mission then.

40:38.877 --> 40:40.710

40:40.712 --> 40:41.881

maybe get us a paper,

40:50.489 --> 40:51.790

score of the game?

40:52.457 --> 40:53.525
That'd be nice.

40:54.091 --> 40:55.525
You should get that
arm checked out.

Maybe kids in Brooklyn.

41:37.935 --> 41:39.270
I don't know about Boston,

41:46.076 --> 41:48.247
Caught a window when we
confronted that mortar team.

41:50.214 --> 41:52.116

just for a moment.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that you
and what's left of your team

to be sorry about, miss.

Just like patching us boys up
is yours.

42:21.580 --> 42:22.581

this every day.

Second fear visits your mind,

43:41.792 --> 43:42.861

people killed out there.

It would be okay, you know.
