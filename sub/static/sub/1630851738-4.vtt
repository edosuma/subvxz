WEBVTT

00:36.036 --> 00:39.122
Duncan,
we're leaving for school in ten.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.624
Do not make me late again.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.043
I won't.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.644
Duncan!

01:06.024 --> 01:06.900
Duncan?

01:08.485 --> 01:09.944
Duncan, are you okay?

01:11.863 --> 01:13.156
What are you looking at?

01:17.285 --> 01:18.620
I think I died here.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.456
I know how that sounds…

01:24.209 --> 01:25.752
but that's how it feels.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.004
What do you remember happening here?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.009
I was a kid…

01:35.428 --> 01:37.388
and I opened that door and then…

01:39.015 --> 01:40.266
You remember the Ghost Key?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.311
A key with a skull on it?

01:43.394 --> 01:44.395
A skull?

01:45.855 --> 01:48.149
Do you remember
using any special keys ever?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.235
Maybe with Dad or his friends?

01:52.862 --> 01:54.239
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:57.951 --> 02:00.745
-Is this what you were talking about?
-Where did you get that?

02:00.829 --> 02:01.955
I found it upstairs.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.666
-Upstairs? Where?
-I… I don't know. I don't remember.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.292
-How long ago? When?
-When?

02:06.376 --> 02:07.919
I'm… I'm not sure.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.674
You know, I'm…

02:14.050 --> 02:16.261
I must still be half asleep.
I'm sorry, guys.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.472
Why don't you ask me again later
after I had a cup of coffee, okay?

02:20.098 --> 02:20.932
Sure.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.690
Not gonna lie. I'm a little worried.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.986
I can't believe you guys broke Uncle Dunc.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.196
We… We didn't break him, Bode.

02:35.738 --> 02:39.033
It really sounds like
you put all of his memories of magic back,

02:39.117 --> 02:41.661
and since he's a grown-up, it broke him.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.746
He seems so confused.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.165
Hopefully, it'll pass.

02:46.749 --> 02:49.043
Also, somehow he…

02:50.837 --> 02:51.754
he found this.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.967
He found the Anywhere Key?

02:57.135 --> 02:58.344
Where? How?

02:59.012 --> 03:02.265
Do you think that Dodge dropped it
during the Crown of Shadows attack?

03:02.348 --> 03:05.476
No, she wouldn't be that clumsy.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.645
Would she?

03:07.729 --> 03:08.980
Who knows?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.317
What door was it in?

03:12.859 --> 03:14.194
Was it even in a door?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.696
-He said it was upstairs. He didn't--
-When did he find it?

03:16.779 --> 03:19.032
-He doesn't remember.
-This is huge. We need to find out!

03:19.115 --> 03:22.327
Yeah, I agree, and we'll deal with it
as soon as we deal with Duncan.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.038
Erin, this was your idea.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.415
I know. I thought it would fix him,

03:28.708 --> 03:32.045
but maybe it's only half the solution.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.382
That key Duncan made,

03:37.217 --> 03:40.470
the one you used with Dad and your friends
to remember magic as adults.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.722
Yeah, the Memory Key,
that's what we called it.

03:42.805 --> 03:46.100
Maybe we can use that
to help his brain process the memories.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.980
Do you have any idea where it is?

03:52.106 --> 03:53.191
I can look for it.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.568
Uh, Rendell hid it somewhere.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.071
We need to fix Uncle Dunc,

03:58.154 --> 04:00.615
but we should also find out

04:00.698 --> 04:03.368
why the Anywhere Key
just appeared out of nowhere.

04:06.079 --> 04:06.913
I'm gonna ask him.

04:06.996 --> 04:07.956
-No.
-Wait.

04:08.039 --> 04:12.335
Look, you stay home and look after Duncan,
but don't harass him about the key.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.837
He's confused enough.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.257
Look, it's only been a few hours.

04:17.340 --> 04:20.927
Let's give it some more time
and see if he recovers.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.517
Even if you could
get your hands on the Ghost Key,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.602
what good's
confronting Chamberlin gonna do?

04:29.686 --> 04:32.397
You can't kill him.
He's already dead. He's a ghost.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.439
Chamberlin played me.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.609
What I don't know is why.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.571
Maybe he got it wrong. He's old.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.908
Yeah, but that old dude
knows exactly what he's doing.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.994
I don't get why
we can't break into Keyhouse

04:46.077 --> 04:48.579
and snatch the Ghost Key
from Bode's drawer

04:48.663 --> 04:49.789
or wherever he keeps it.

04:49.872 --> 04:50.873
Because.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.794
You don't think
I would have tried that a long time ago?

04:55.920 --> 04:59.465
The key's still in his possession.
Even if he doesn't just have it on him.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.889
Scot! Glad I ran into you.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.641
So,

05:10.226 --> 05:12.437
this dorm social I'm hosting tonight…

05:13.521 --> 05:14.522
Right. Yeah.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.525
Just wanna make sure you and Gabe
worked out your differences.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.904
I promise you don't have to worry.
You will not see a repeat performance.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.325
Okay. Good man. Thanks.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.674
Oh my God. Is it your birthday?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.552
I can't believe you did this.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.805
-Someone's really into you!
-You are so sweet.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.397
I promised you something epic,

05:57.648 --> 05:58.858
and now I can deliver.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.819
Epic.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.364
Thank you.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.826
I have to admit,
I think I already have this one.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.831
-This isn't the gift.
-No, I love it! I…

06:15.458 --> 06:16.876
Do you remember what this does?

06:18.669 --> 06:19.754
Yeah.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.801
Six interlocked circles.
You said it could take you anywhere.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.392
Are we going anywhere now?

06:32.475 --> 06:36.270
Okay. I need you to take a good look,
this door on the back cover.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.730
Okay.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.192
Now close your eyes.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.361
Mm-hmm.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.155
And picture that door.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.998
-Watch your step.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.341
Now open your eyes.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.722
That's…

07:11.806 --> 07:13.057
Good day, miss.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.061
Tyler?

07:17.145 --> 07:18.438
Coming up ahead,

07:18.521 --> 07:21.441
we'll be stopping at the home
where Jane Austen once lived.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.943
Wait, did he say Jane Austen?

07:26.821 --> 07:27.947
Look familiar?

07:29.198 --> 07:31.033
-We're--
-In Bath.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.121
Happy birthday, Jackie.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.957
Oh my God!

07:42.170 --> 07:45.339
-So tonight's your big dorm social, right?
-Uh-huh.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.757
What have you got planned?

07:47.258 --> 07:49.844
-You mean like games? I don't do games.
-Yeah.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.472
Oh! Ego still bruised
that I beat you bowling?

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
Absolutely not.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.976
I think it made me a lot stronger
and more resilient.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.979
Ah. Well, you are gonna feed them, right?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.314
Yeah, I suppose so.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.775
Maybe I should get that chowder
this town is obsessed with.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.613
No, no! Chowder is not dorm party food.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.407
Unless you want your place
smelling like seafood for a week.

08:12.366 --> 08:16.454
Right. See, this is why my wife
was the social chair of our relationship.

08:16.537 --> 08:20.500
Mm-hmm. Pizza.
Trust me, pizza is your friend.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.210
-Okay.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.169
Thank you.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.713
Bye.

08:31.052 --> 08:31.886
Kins.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.013
I need to talk to you.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.062
Okay. Listen, listen. Um…

08:41.145 --> 08:42.146
You…

08:42.230 --> 08:45.274
You must know that what happened yesterday
was not my fault.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.737
The only logical explanation is… is magic.
I was clearly not in control.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.614
Scot, I checked with Duncan.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.200
-And?
-The music box was back at Keyhouse.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.910
-No one was using it.

08:55.993 --> 08:59.747
Maybe it was another key. How do
we know how many are actually out there?

08:59.830 --> 09:03.167
-You've been really stressed out lately.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

09:03.251 --> 09:05.294
I mean, okay. Yes.

09:05.378 --> 09:09.298
Yes, I have. I've been stressed out,
but that is not what happened yesterday.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.843
I think Gabe was in on it.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.303
What?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.639
Think about it. He was being so combative.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.392
It was almost like he…
he wanted me to attack him.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.852
He's the only one to gain
from doing something like that.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.772
-You think he's jealous of you?
-I mean, maybe.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.566
Maybe he doesn't like

09:26.649 --> 09:29.360
that you and I were able to stay friends
after everything.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.362
-Gabe defended you!
-Right.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.699
Even after you pushed him,
he thought we should give you a pass.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.284
Oh, how bloody charitable.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.203
-What is your problem with him?
-Come on, Kinsey! You know me!

09:40.413 --> 09:41.372
Kinsey…

09:42.790 --> 09:43.958
…you know me.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.338
How well can you really say
that you know Gabe?

09:53.050 --> 09:55.344
I've known him
just as long as I've known you.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.314
Well, did you know
he's been hanging out with Eden?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.234
I saw him this morning in the dorms.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.572
In fact, they weren't just hanging out.
They were arguing intimately.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.867
And from where I was standing,
it was pretty damn intense.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.661
Whatever you saw,
you must have misunderstood.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.455
What, you don't believe me?

10:23.497 --> 10:25.082
You don't bel… You know what?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.294
Ever since you messed with your head,
you don't see things clearly.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.297
Sorry, it's true.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.176
Maybe it's better for everyone
if you get into that school.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.406
Uncle Dunc?

11:00.576 --> 11:03.579
-Uncle Dunc?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.955
I'm resting, buddy.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.083
How long are you resting for?

11:10.044 --> 11:12.004
Just a little while longer. Okay?

11:36.612 --> 11:37.697
Hmm.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.329
Mmm.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.685
Rendell, I'm scared.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.272
It's okay.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.606
I'm right here.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.371
Hey!

12:27.455 --> 12:28.914
Hey, you're home.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.084
Uh, yeah,
I stayed home from school today.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.754
Oh, that's perfect
because I kinda need a favor.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.674
Yeah, the Savinis are trying
to find a creepy patch of woods

12:38.758 --> 12:40.259
to film a scene in the sequel,

12:40.342 --> 12:44.680
and I was thinking I could probably cover
a lot more ground way faster

12:44.764 --> 12:45.765
if I was a ghost.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.393
You'd only be able
to fly around Keyhouse grounds.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.312
Yeah, that's fine.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.691
All right. Come in.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.616
You gotta be quick.
Uncle Duncan's upstairs,

13:03.699 --> 13:06.202
and I don't want him
to see your body and freak out.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.286
Understood.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.897
Back already?

13:35.898 --> 13:36.899
You lied to me.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.651
I followed your lead.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.737
You may have them fooled for now,

13:41.821 --> 13:45.825
but on this side,
you can't hide who you are.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.910
You're no friend to the Lockes.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.915
I see that parasite
that's latched onto your spine.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.879
-Guess you got me.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.867
You made me waste
my last piece of Whispering Iron.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.580
Do you have any idea
what I had to do to get that door open?

14:32.663 --> 14:33.539
Yes.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.877
I'd hoped that Rendell's children
would be spared

14:37.960 --> 14:40.504
the evils behind that door.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.257
That I'd be able to protect them.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.593
But sadly,

14:46.385 --> 14:49.263
keeping the truth from them
was not enough.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.474
You will tell me what I need to know!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.685
You don't have a chance
of making a key.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.478
You never did.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.689
You're not one of us.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.463
Duncan!

16:08.926 --> 16:09.927
You don't have to worry.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.721
You'll remember what matters.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.847
I promise.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.359
No, no, no, no.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.028
Oh shit. Not this.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.282
What are you guys doing?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.000
Uncle Dunc?

16:41.083 --> 16:44.336
-What are you doing in here?

16:57.182 --> 16:59.101
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.146
I'm just, uh…

17:04.148 --> 17:05.607
sorting some things out.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.946
Let's head back, okay?

17:13.073 --> 17:14.033
Come on.

17:19.163 --> 17:23.959
You had a good thing going,
but that will all be over soon.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.963
What are you looking at?

17:31.759 --> 17:32.885
Now, Sam!

17:33.969 --> 17:34.803
Now!

18:10.964 --> 18:13.801
You wish. You can't kill me, Sam.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.096
I'm not gonna
let you hurt anyone again.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.750
Nice try, asshole.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.585
No!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.439
Hey, thanks again, bud.
See you later, Duncan.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.029
So, what were you doing in the shed?

19:18.031 --> 19:21.994
I had this memory. I was with your father
and his friends, and I was upset.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.121
I was so upset. I don't remember why.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.085
I need to go lie down, okay?
My head is just pounding.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.837
Uh…

19:34.298 --> 19:35.757
Okay.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.529
-Anything I can help you find?

19:57.613 --> 20:02.117
Ah! I wish.
I was just looking for something to read.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.505
Still so weird to see him like this.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.885
Older?

20:19.968 --> 20:21.011
No.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.930
Well, I mean, yeah.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.934
But also his beard.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.771
He didn't have to shave
till his senior year.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.773
Looks good on him though.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.900
Yeah, it did.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.742
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about him
if you don't want to.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.535
No. Um…

20:46.370 --> 20:50.082
I wanna be able to talk about him
without devolving into tears.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.254
He told me about you.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.425
I think it was the last time
I actually saw him.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.054
He came back to visit over Labor Day.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.932
Summer after his first year of college.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.768
Rendell came back here?

21:09.851 --> 21:11.728
I didn't know.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.731
It was a relief
to see him so happy.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.567
He saw his future with you.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.448
-Excuse me.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.838
Hey, how's Duncan?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.551
Something is
definitely wrong with him.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.345
He had a memory
of something happening in the shed,

21:45.429 --> 21:46.805
and it gave him a headache.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.223
Now he's upstairs resting.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.268
This was a mistake.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.149
We can't just let him go on like this.
He's getting worse.

21:57.941 --> 22:00.277
When Tyler gets home,
we're taking the memories out.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.072
I should've known better.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.535
I can't even count how many mistakes
I've made since I took my fear out.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.959
Well, if that's how you feel,

22:17.502 --> 22:19.421
why don't you just put it back in?

22:20.464 --> 22:22.132
Because I don't know where it is.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.635
You can control stuff
inside your head, right?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.096
Somewhat.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.681
[curious music playing

22:30.557 --> 22:34.770
So maybe you can control stuff
that used to be in there.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.731
Try concentrating.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.408
What do you think?

23:30.700 --> 23:32.702
I think you need one in every color.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.038
I wanna get something for you.

23:35.872 --> 23:36.915
I'm good. Thank you.

23:36.998 --> 23:40.502
But you are not gonna leave Bath
without this. I'm sorry.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.964
Okay, but I'm determined
to find you the perfect souvenir.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.396
Three for one, over here.
Three for one.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.319
Excuse me. Excuse me!

24:10.824 --> 24:12.200
Help you, miss?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.828
Uh-- No, um…

24:16.455 --> 24:18.582
-What?
-Miss, you need anything?

24:19.749 --> 24:22.711
I don't really know. Um…

24:26.882 --> 24:27.757
I'm sorry.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.343
What are you looking at?
If you do that again…

24:32.137 --> 24:34.347
Get away from me! Go! Get away!

24:34.431 --> 24:35.348
Jackie!

24:36.683 --> 24:37.684
Jackie!

24:38.602 --> 24:40.228
Tyler.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.861
What's going on? Where are we?

24:48.361 --> 24:51.031
Okay. You're okay.
We're in England. Okay?

24:51.114 --> 24:53.158
I don't understand. How did we get here?

24:53.241 --> 24:54.159
Okay. Don't worry.

24:54.242 --> 24:58.079
-We made a video actually that explains.
-Tyler, I wanna go home.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.957
Okay. Okay.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.609
Hand it over.
I know you have it.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.529
Hello?

25:33.281 --> 25:34.366
Bode, is that you?

25:35.367 --> 25:38.537
No! What did you do?

26:12.445 --> 26:13.363
Duncan?

26:17.117 --> 26:18.118
You all right?

26:18.201 --> 26:21.830
My brother killed Lucas right there.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.293
Why would he do that?

26:28.253 --> 26:29.588
How could he do that?

26:31.047 --> 26:33.550
Duncan, I don't think you understand.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.096
You were there.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.266
Is everything okay?

26:42.475 --> 26:44.311
He's remembering that night.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.648
Rendell was just trying to protect us.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.152
I know it seems confusing,
but Rendell was just trying to protect--

26:52.235 --> 26:55.280
Don't touch me! Please.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.117
Duncan!

27:07.792 --> 27:10.545
Duncan, I'm so sorry.
We're… We're gonna fix this.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.006
Please. Just let me rest, please.

27:18.386 --> 27:19.638
I can't wait for Tyler.

27:21.181 --> 27:24.142
-We need to take the memories out now.
-If we could just find the Memory Key…

27:37.364 --> 27:38.448
What was that?

27:48.333 --> 27:51.336
-Maybe this isn't the best idea.
-Shh.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.403
Feel any different?

29:03.324 --> 29:04.284
I'd forgotten.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.789
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.252
And that's good?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.213
Better to know what I'm up against.

29:22.844 --> 29:23.970
Can I borrow that?

29:26.931 --> 29:31.561
Just give me one more chance
before we remove his memories again.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.370
Oh! I'm sorry.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.372
No problem. I was just leaving.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.838
What was that about?

30:00.757 --> 30:03.802
She just needed to borrow something.
I'm running late.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.055
-I was hoping we could talk.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.265
I gotta get ready for Mr. Bennett's party.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.559
Um, I thought it was a dorm thing.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.771
It is mostly,
but Gabe wanted me to go with him.

30:16.022 --> 30:19.526
You know, I actually
wanted to talk to you about him.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.446
-Gabe?

30:24.030 --> 30:24.864
Josh.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.491
Can it wait till I get home?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.536
-Sure.
-Thanks.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.456
Have fun.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.465
So this has happened before.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.638
More and more.
The closer you get to your birthday.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.434
I know how confusing this must feel. I--

30:53.518 --> 30:54.853
But you don't know.

30:56.062 --> 30:56.938
You couldn't.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.985
You're right. I don't.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.403
Not yet.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.454
God, I don't
wanna do this anymore.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.332
-Do what?
-This!

31:16.875 --> 31:19.085
Magic! Trying to hold on to it.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.296
Maybe we should
stop fighting the inevitable.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.881
No, but it's not inevitable.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.925
My dad and his friends,
they… they found a way.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.346
-They figured it out. We can too.
-You're not hearing me, Tyler.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.768
I don't wanna feel this way anymore.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.357
It's… It's too hard.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.237
Jackie, please.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.407
I just need some more time.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.284
Just…

31:52.285 --> 31:54.871
Just give me a little more time
to figure this out.

32:16.559 --> 32:17.769
Hi, Kins.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.063
Hey.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.942
You don't even live in the dorms.
You just here for the free grub like me?

32:24.692 --> 32:26.069
No, she came with Gabe.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.446
Gotcha.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.866
You see any veggie pies?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.369
Uh, on the table over there.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.833
-Did I miss something?
-No. I'm gonna get a water.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.920
Definitely something.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.264
I thought you were
a gluten-free carb hater.

32:56.975 --> 33:01.562
Sometimes we gotta just not give a shit,
you know?

33:01.646 --> 33:05.650
Don't make me start liking you,
Eden Hawkins. That'd mess with my world.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.723
Missed you in class.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.519
Where were you this morning?

33:42.687 --> 33:47.567
Uh, yeah, I didn't do the reading,
so I just stayed in my room for a while.

33:54.782 --> 33:55.700
You okay?

33:56.659 --> 33:57.910
Yeah. Fine.

34:11.841 --> 34:15.386
And this Springfield rifle-musket
dates back to 1855.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.264
It was actually the first
US regulation arm

34:18.347 --> 34:21.642
to use the .58-caliber
hollow-base Minié-style bullet.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.727
"Mini!"

34:22.810 --> 34:26.147
It's perfect for you
since you're pocket-size!

34:26.230 --> 34:28.399
Hey! Have some respect.

34:28.983 --> 34:32.236
I, uh… I take history
really seriously, so…

34:34.072 --> 34:36.991
Um, is this, uh…
Is this like… like an old musket ball?

34:37.075 --> 34:39.035
-I found it with some old papers--
-Oh!

34:39.118 --> 34:41.621
Uh, don't touch that, please.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.538
Sorry.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.373
This was not supposed to be out.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.836
This is a journal
written by an ancestor of mine,

34:48.920 --> 34:50.254
Captain Frederick Gideon.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.591
He was a British soldier
during the Revolution.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.384
Oh yeah.
Weren't they the bad guys?

34:55.468 --> 34:56.886
Is that even a question?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.513
-Shut up!
-How would I know?

34:58.596 --> 35:00.389
I'm trying to find out more about him,

35:00.473 --> 35:04.268
including why this piece of ammo
was found alongside his journal.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.576
I… I think he's still sleeping.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.836
How's he doing?

35:32.421 --> 35:33.965
He's had a pretty rough day.

35:39.762 --> 35:41.013
Guessing you did too.

35:45.768 --> 35:49.564
I think I may know how to find out
where Rendell hid the Memory Key.

36:09.083 --> 36:12.128
The last time I saw the key
was the last time I saw him.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.672
But I buried that memory.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.060
But if I can find it…

36:30.438 --> 36:31.898
maybe I can help Duncan.

36:37.278 --> 36:41.032
I won't let you
get trapped in there again. I promise.

37:02.094 --> 37:03.512
Hey, have you seen Gabe?

37:04.388 --> 37:05.765
No, not for a while.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.146
Know what?
I think I'm… I'm gonna head out.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.190
Okay, I'll catch up.

37:19.445 --> 37:23.282
Always thought
Brits didn't let on how they're feeling.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.495
Yeah, he's not really
handling it all so well.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.831
I don't know why
he's taking it out on you.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.041
I defended Gabe.

37:33.918 --> 37:34.919
Yeah.

37:35.753 --> 37:39.131
Bright side, at least now,
they'll have time to work out their shit.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.592
Bright side of what?

37:43.177 --> 37:46.138
Scot staying.
He didn't get the spot at Rochester.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.978
He didn't tell you?

37:54.063 --> 37:58.526
Well, I guess now you guys will have time
to work it out too.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.614
I'm gonna go find Gabe.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.880
Jeez, someone needs a new hobby.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.636
Look familiar?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.850
Why does he have Whispering Iron?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.770
Unclear. But at least you get to live now.

38:36.522 --> 38:37.481
What?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.318
Well, I may have been thinking about

38:40.401 --> 38:43.279
repurposing the Whispering Iron
that's inside of you.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.450
But I guess I don't have
to do that anymore.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.703
I'm just kidding.

38:52.830 --> 38:53.748
Hey.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.959
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Uh…

38:57.043 --> 38:59.170
Gabe, ever the gentleman,

39:00.504 --> 39:02.465
was showing me to the bathroom,

39:02.548 --> 39:07.303
and we got lost somehow,
so I'm going to go find the bathroom.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.387
Yeah. Uh…

39:17.438 --> 39:18.397
You ready to go?

39:20.066 --> 39:20.900
Sure.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.785
Little shock.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.739
May I?

40:14.662 --> 40:17.289
We used the Memory Key
so we wouldn't forget.

40:17.915 --> 40:20.418
So we'd be forced to live with our guilt.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.462
But adults aren't supposed
to remember magic.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.215
So that's why Rendell decided
to hide the key.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.926
There! That's where he went.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.095
Matheson Academy.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.224
The key's gotta be hidden there somewhere.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.018
It's a start.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.487
Why is it so quiet? Didn't you miss me?

40:55.786 --> 40:58.205
Gabe, I think we have a problem.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.006
I really didn't think she had it in her.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.801
Kinsey was acting pretty weird
at the party.

41:12.261 --> 41:15.431
I guess the little monster
made her way back home.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.101
What are we gonna do now?

41:23.439 --> 41:26.442
You said that you need a Locke
in order to make a key, right?

41:29.528 --> 41:32.156
Well, what are we waiting for? Hmm?

41:32.948 --> 41:34.450
Go get your girl.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.837
Hey.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.424
How was the party?

41:51.175 --> 41:52.218
Fine.

41:53.677 --> 41:54.512
Kinsey.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.015
Kinsey.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.351
Come sit with me.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.530
I know that, um…

42:14.073 --> 42:16.867
…seeing me with Josh at school like that

42:17.409 --> 42:18.786
must have been strange.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.163
It's still very early.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.458
-I don't even know if I'm ready to--
-But, Mom, you guys look cute together.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.922
If you're happy, then I'm happy for you.

42:34.927 --> 42:35.886
Thanks.

42:39.473 --> 42:40.516
I just thought

42:41.725 --> 42:44.186
maybe that's why you seemed out of sorts.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.526
Did something happen with Gabe?

42:55.531 --> 42:57.658
How can you tell if something's a red flag

42:57.741 --> 43:00.661
or just something
you're blowing way out of proportion?

43:01.829 --> 43:03.581
Especially when
you've been second-guessing

43:03.664 --> 43:05.124
every decision you ever made?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.626
Or close to it?

43:10.421 --> 43:12.256
There is no easy answer there.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.885
I think you just gotta trust your gut.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.098
You're an overthinker.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.851
Your dad was the same way.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.186
So it's his fault.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.606
Completely.

43:47.791 --> 43:51.253
-What are you doing in here?

43:51.837 --> 43:52.921
You drawing?

43:54.882 --> 43:55.758
Can I see?

43:58.218 --> 43:59.178
Please

44:00.554 --> 44:01.639
stop.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.644
What's wrong?

44:10.272 --> 44:11.148
Get out.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.696
-Get out.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.366
You're not real.

44:21.950 --> 44:22.951
Get out!
