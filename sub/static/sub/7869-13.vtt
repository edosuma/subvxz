tradition

01:41.368 --> 01:42.935
of going out with
each other's sisters.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.270
Is there anything better
than my best friend's face

01:45.272 --> 01:48.307
on a girl body?
Not that I can think of.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.708
Nothing better.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.743
Boy, I love
Valentine's Day.

Of course I do.

02:15.436 --> 02:15.901
Got a hot date.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.971
Come on, scram,
so I can get ready.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.841
I'm telling you,
I'm fine.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.176
I never been happier.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.210
See? There.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.045
There, that's a smile, right?

was like that movie somehow.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.614
Well, I'm gonna tell you

03:05.953 --> 03:08.420

Dr. Kissingher.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.530
Eh, what have I got to lose.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.698
They say for every man

03:19.700 --> 03:22.734
somewhere on Earth
there's one woman.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.723
(chuckles)
Oh, Marge, don't worry.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.758
A lot of movie stars
have gray hair,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.695
like all those women
we loved in the '80s.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.565
Homie, you always
mean to say

04:26.567 --> 04:28.533
the nicest things.

04:29.003 --> 04:32.537
Well, it's not easy with
you talking all the time.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.039
(chuckles)

04:40.848 --> 04:43.048
Uh, excuse me,
is this the seminar

04:43.050 --> 04:45.183
where you learn
how to pick up free escorts?

04:45.185 --> 04:48.120
Well, we're not learning
how to fold cloth napkins.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.956
Well, I got excited
for nothing.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.724
MAN (over speakers):
Gentlemen,
(disco music playing)

04:52.726 --> 04:55.627
prepare for the potentate
of the potent date,

04:55.629 --> 04:59.631
the know-it-all of the protocol
of the booty call,

04:59.633 --> 05:04.102
Dr. Kiss... ing... her!

05:04.104 --> 05:07.139
(cheering and hooting)

05:07.141 --> 05:10.042
Once we were
single-celled organisms

05:10.044 --> 05:12.144
who could replicate
whenever we wanted.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.612
(shouting, cheering)

05:13.614 --> 05:15.480
We were men back then!

05:15.482 --> 05:17.582
But today we need more help.
Who's first?

05:17.584 --> 05:20.018
You! The guy who's been here
since 3:00 this afternoon.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.422
It's hell to meet girls when
you're paid in chickens.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.924
Okay, I'm a sexy girl,
and research shows

05:25.926 --> 05:27.259
that my decision
to sleep with you

05:27.261 --> 05:30.329
happens in
the first 6.5 seconds.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.530
Go!

05:31.532 --> 05:33.031
Eh, my name's Willie,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.666
and, uh, all I do
is get drunk

05:34.668 --> 05:37.102
and kill squirrels
with me shovel.

05:37.104 --> 05:42.407
Okay, now I'll translate that
into romance language.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.909
Hi. I'm William.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.044
I'm a connoisseur
of fine spirits,

05:46.046 --> 05:47.746
and I love animals to death.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.015
Do me next!
Do me next!

05:50.017 --> 05:51.683
Ah! A monster! Save me!

05:51.685 --> 05:54.953
(chuckles)
Sorry, that was
unprofessional.

05:54.955 --> 05:55.754
Please, go on.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.588
Name's Moe Szyslak.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.889
As a kid, I had roundworm.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.493
Heck, I was more worm
than boy for a couple of years.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.495
I dabbled
in Satanism

06:03.497 --> 06:04.229
until I was
asked to leave.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.467
Oh, and one month, I ate
nothing but aquarium fish.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.535
(sighs)
Your only hope
is to use a wingman.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.703
Uh, what's a wingman?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.239
A wingman is a friend...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.307
Now I got to
find a friend?

06:15.309 --> 06:18.477
You need someone
who's secretly on your side,

06:18.479 --> 06:19.244
making you look good to women.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.913
But he can't more handsome
or appealing than you.
Okay,

06:21.915 --> 06:26.017
let's take a flip
through the old Moe-lodex.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.451
Ooh.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.154
Bingo. That was a weird day.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.756
Sir, would you
be my wingman?

06:30.758 --> 06:32.791
We could try it out
this weekend

06:32.793 --> 06:35.227
at the "Faculty Follies"
after-party.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.729
One thing-- what if there's
a woman we both like?

06:37.731 --> 06:41.066
Well, we'll use
the time-honored
"I saw her first" rule.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.003
What if I see her
hand at the same time
you see her face?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.571
Face beats hand!

06:47.975 --> 06:49.775
So, after dinner
I cut his hair,

06:49.777 --> 06:52.511
and he readjusted
my mortgage.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.080
(giggles)
That's what he does.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.849
And how was your
Valentine's Day?

06:57.851 --> 06:58.950
Very romantic.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.354
Homer had the basketball game
muted the whole time.

07:02.356 --> 07:05.490
Oh, and then I found
a gray hair-- no big deal.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.425
Mmm.

07:06.427 --> 07:09.594
Marge, it's time I
told you the truth.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.564
You've been grayer than
a Seattle Cinco de Mayo

07:12.566 --> 07:13.999
for years now.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.801
Really?

07:16.303 --> 07:17.636
Yes, the dye not only
colors your hair,

07:17.638 --> 07:21.807
but the fumes wipe the
experience from your mind.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.009
Jimothy, Aquanetta,

07:24.011 --> 07:24.776
is touch-up time!

07:24.778 --> 07:26.511
Gloves and foil, people!

07:26.513 --> 07:27.913
Let's go!
Crinkle, crinkle!

07:27.915 --> 07:29.681
(gasps)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:29.683 --> 07:32.384
(water running, Marge whimpers)

07:32.820 --> 07:34.653
Oh, Janis,
I'm so sorry.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.954
Can we reschedule?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.156
It's a battle of the
Blue and Gray here,

07:38.158 --> 07:40.192
and I am Gaybraham
Lincoln, baby.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.128
Oh, that's okay.
I only needed a touch-up.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.796
My husband and I
can use the time

07:44.798 --> 07:46.998
to take a long,
romantic walk.

07:47.468 --> 07:51.169
Hmm, she doesn't seem so
worried about her gray hair.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.872
Oh, herself-confidence
doesn't come from a bottle.

07:53.874 --> 07:58.743
Now, let's rub this toxic
blue goo onto your scalp.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.612
Mm-hmm.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.215
A little of that.

08:03.217 --> 08:04.749
Mix it up.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.951
Mm-hmm.

08:05.953 --> 08:09.187
(worried moan)

08:12.025 --> 08:13.959
Hmm.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.694
(moans)

08:18.332 --> 08:19.397
(door closes)

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
MARGE:
I brought home fried chicken.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.603
And a completely new hairstyle.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.938
(gasping)

08:28.275 --> 08:31.443
A completely new hairstyle.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.884
So, what do you think?

08:38.886 --> 08:41.686
(alarm buzzing, siren wailing)

08:41.989 --> 08:44.356
She wants an honest answer.
What do we do?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.957
I don't know.
I don't know!

08:45.959 --> 08:47.125
We could fake
a stroke.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.627
The last time
we faked a stroke,

08:48.629 --> 08:49.261
it led to a real one.

08:49.263 --> 08:50.996
We're running out of time,
people.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.832
We need an answer,
and it has to be great!

08:56.270 --> 08:59.104
So... chicken.

08:59.106 --> 08:59.905
Hmm.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.673
EXECUTIVES HOMER'S HEAD:
D'oh!

09:01.675 --> 09:05.343
Well, what do you kids
think of the real me? Huh?

09:05.345 --> 09:06.077
I love it.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.113
I know I use the word
"empowering" a lot,

09:08.115 --> 09:10.715
but this time,
it really is that.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.784
I just have one question
about hair.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.652
Where does mine start?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.987
Head, head, head, hair.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.622
Where's the border?

09:17.624 --> 09:20.559
Oh, my God. Me, too!

09:21.662 --> 09:23.161
What are we?

09:23.397 --> 09:25.063
What do you
think, Homie?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.632
Sweetie, you've always
been beautiful,

09:27.634 --> 09:30.035
but now you're
my silver belle.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.138
Let me get the camera
we use for precious moments

09:33.140 --> 09:34.573
and insurance claims.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.310
(anguished grunt)
What has she done?

09:38.312 --> 09:40.378
I feel like I'm married
to Richard Gere.

09:40.380 --> 09:40.845
(phone rings)

09:40.847 --> 09:43.381
I can't talk now.
I'm talking to myself.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.449
No, no, Homer. Go ahead.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.184
Thanks, Homer.
It'll just be a minute.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.018
What's up?
Hey, wingman,

09:47.020 --> 09:49.521
you're supposed to be
here like you promised.

09:49.523 --> 09:52.390
Oh, thank you, prior obligation.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.061
(engine roaring,
tires squealing)

09:56.063 --> 09:57.329
(gasping)

09:57.331 --> 09:58.763
I can't take it.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.733
I'm just going to draw
a hairline on.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.135
(electrical crackling)

10:04.371 --> 10:05.904
HOMER:
So, basically,

10:05.906 --> 10:08.907
my job is to make you
look good by comparison.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.743
Like West Virginia
does for Virginia.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.844
(Homer chuckling)

10:12.846 --> 10:17.682
The good doctor
has just the prescription.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.084
"Jumping on the Grenade:"

10:19.086 --> 10:22.120
the wingman engages
the less attractive friend,

10:22.122 --> 10:24.122
isolating the target.
Voop!

10:24.124 --> 10:28.193
You ever notice that pizzas
have gotten so small lately?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.661
They're like dimes.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.363
Yes, that's exactly it!

10:31.365 --> 10:32.664
Well, a girl
could starve to death!

10:32.666 --> 10:36.501
Wow, your friend did
something I could never do.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.702
What's that?

10:37.704 --> 10:39.104
Walk away from you.

10:39.106 --> 10:39.638
(grunts excitedly)

10:39.640 --> 10:43.008
"Taking Down a Rival,"
aka "Talk Blocking."

10:43.010 --> 10:44.242
(mimics machine
powering down)

10:44.244 --> 10:47.846
So, Lenny, ever get
that rebar out of your head?

10:47.848 --> 10:49.648
No, they just
sawed off the ends

10:49.650 --> 10:50.649
and painted over the nubs.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.018
Hey, where you going, baby?

10:53.754 --> 10:56.821
Oh, no, you don't.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.459
Nice talk-blocking.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.061
Would you be willing
to wingman for me?

11:03.063 --> 11:05.196
Well, I don't know.
It's a lot of work.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.565
Oh, I just ordered this
bottomless pitcher of beer

11:07.567 --> 11:10.168
and circumference-less
platter of nachos.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.102
Deal!

11:11.104 --> 11:14.773
Need some cooling
down, hot stuff?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.474
(Homer shrieks)

11:16.476 --> 11:19.944
Okay, just imagine
she's a Bond girl.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.947
Oh! Judi Dench?!

11:22.949 --> 11:24.916
Kiss me, 007.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.618
(laughing)
Good show,

11:26.620 --> 11:29.487
Mr. Bond.
(laughs)

11:35.929 --> 11:36.795
(wind whistling)

11:36.797 --> 11:39.664
Help! My macaroni Marconi!

11:39.666 --> 11:40.265
Hmm?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.167
(Lisa and Marge panting)

11:42.169 --> 11:44.102
Bart, what happened
to your Mom's hair?

11:44.104 --> 11:48.106
Did she see something scary like
that vampire onSesame Street?

11:48.108 --> 11:50.442
They should warn you
when he's coming.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.911
I don't want to talk
about my Mom's hair.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.713
Right. It's just weird.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.015
Normally, I think
your mom is hot...

11:57.017 --> 11:59.050
Take that back!
I'm sorry.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.820
What I mean is,
she's not hot anymore.

12:01.822 --> 12:02.854
Take that back!

12:02.856 --> 12:04.322
(grunting)

12:04.324 --> 12:04.856
So moody!

12:04.858 --> 12:08.393
Just like my mom
on her "can't dance" days.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.662
(grunting)

12:11.898 --> 12:14.599
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

12:15.135 --> 12:19.003
Huh. Let's see
what cousin Jessica's up to.

12:21.108 --> 12:25.210
There's a woman
who's got it all under control.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.346
Hmm?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.815
(gasps)
Ooh!

12:30.817 --> 12:35.086
Marge, your hair--
it's fantastic!

12:35.088 --> 12:36.488
Well, thank you.

12:36.490 --> 12:39.157
No, thank you
for your bravery.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.225
(grumbles)

12:40.227 --> 12:42.994
I hope I look half
as good as you

12:42.996 --> 12:44.395
when I give up.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.132
Such audacity!

12:47.267 --> 12:48.600
Grandma had hair
like that

12:48.602 --> 12:52.937
when she went to sleep
in her forever box.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.606
(grumbles)

13:00.213 --> 13:02.747
You can't listen
to those women, Mom.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.082
Change threatens them.

13:04.084 --> 13:04.783
They didn't like it

13:04.785 --> 13:08.353
when the Springfield Shopper
started printing in color.

13:08.355 --> 13:08.853
Neither did I.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.457
I didn't want to know what color
the Statue of Liberty was.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.826
But you know what?
I was wrong.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.661
And these ladies are, too.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.095
(beeping)

13:17.097 --> 13:20.331
Ma'am, do you have any
kind of a discount card?

13:20.333 --> 13:20.999
What kind of card?

13:21.001 --> 13:25.370
Well, you know, maybe
you belong to the A.A...

13:25.372 --> 13:26.938
The A.A.? No!

13:26.940 --> 13:29.007
Oh, no, I meant
the A.A...

13:29.009 --> 13:30.341
A.A.A.?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.743
No, I'm not in Triple-A.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.779
I don't like
their Westways magazine.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.014
They'll give four diamonds

13:36.016 --> 13:38.516
to any place
that's got a lid on the toilet.

13:38.518 --> 13:42.620
No, I meant the A.A... R...

13:44.624 --> 13:46.891
P?! (gasps)

13:46.893 --> 13:50.061
The A.A.R.P.?!

13:50.063 --> 13:50.962
Well, that tears it.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.199
I don't want this milk,
and I'm not gonna take it back.

13:54.201 --> 13:57.702
That's okay. We have a young
man who does that for you.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.703
Oh, right here, ma'am.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.338
Oh, boy, a put-back!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.807
I hope it takes me
by the freezer section.

14:02.809 --> 14:06.744
Stick my head in the pizza case,
it's like a ski vacation!

14:06.746 --> 14:09.948
I can imagine the pepperonis
are Swiss chalets

14:09.950 --> 14:14.285
nestled in a big layer
of mozzarella snow!

14:14.921 --> 14:17.889
Bart, eyewitnesses
to your fight described you

14:17.891 --> 14:20.091
as "berserkoid,"
"totally aggro,"

14:20.093 --> 14:23.494
and said you punched Milhouse,
"like, 50 billion times."

14:23.496 --> 14:26.364
That's an excessive
number of times.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.067
What's bothering you, son?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.702
I-I don't want to talk about it.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.438
Thank God.
I don't want to, either.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.942
Remember, Bart, anything
you say here is confidential.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.510
Can we close the door?

14:39.512 --> 14:40.845
Oh, there is no door.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.180
State regulations.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.414
Hey, Bart!

14:43.416 --> 14:43.915
Still freaking out

14:43.917 --> 14:47.151
'cause your mom aged 30 years
in a day?

14:47.153 --> 14:48.653
Don't judge them too harshly.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.320
They recently learned

14:49.322 --> 14:52.023
they were once two-thirds
of conjoined triplets.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.291
And the third one
is out for revenge.

14:53.293 --> 14:57.028
Now, Bart, share your most
intimate thoughts with me.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.563
I don't think I want to.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.031
Oh. Well, maybe it'd be easier

15:00.033 --> 15:04.569
for you to talk
to my colleague, Dr. Thera-bear.

15:05.906 --> 15:06.771
Well...

15:06.773 --> 15:08.907
Hold on. I'm not allowed
in the room

15:08.909 --> 15:11.175
while you talk
to the bear.

15:11.177 --> 15:11.910
(humming)

15:11.912 --> 15:17.382
All right, I know there's
a camera in you somewhere.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.350
(grunting)

15:19.352 --> 15:24.689
They never think to look behind
the jazz-fest poster.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.126
So it's true.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.862
Your hair committed
blue-icide.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.730
(laughter)

15:32.732 --> 15:34.465
I thought you'd
be more supportive.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.501
I mean, you went
gray yourselves.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.635
No, we didn't.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.705
This is just
smoke and ash.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.313
So what does your husband,

15:48.315 --> 15:50.748
Vidal Baboon,
think of the new look?

15:50.750 --> 15:51.783
He loves it!

15:51.785 --> 15:55.019
He calls me his
silver belle.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.721
That means he hates it.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.322
If he really liked it,

15:57.324 --> 16:00.558
he'd just paw at it
instead of getting all clever.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.793
Why are you always trying

16:01.795 --> 16:03.661
to cause trouble
with me and Homer?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.063
Our marriage is rock solid!

16:05.065 --> 16:08.967
So, do you think Homer is gonna
be at Club Zipless tonight?

16:08.969 --> 16:10.234
I sure hope so.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.202
(startled gasp)

16:11.204 --> 16:12.971
Oops, dropped my stirrer.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.505
D'oh!
D'oh!

16:14.507 --> 16:15.406
(horrified gasp)

16:15.408 --> 16:18.776
Well, Marge.
Ready to kick Homer to the curb?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.511
I can bend him
like Beckham.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.214
Sorry, but I'm
fighting for my man!

16:23.216 --> 16:25.583
Give me a double espresso to go.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.951
Ma'am, are you
sure that's wise,

16:26.953 --> 16:30.088
with what I presume
is your heart condition?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.789
Ooh!

16:34.127 --> 16:35.426
(engine revs, tires screech)

16:35.428 --> 16:36.928
Whoo!

16:36.930 --> 16:38.329
Go, granny, go!

16:38.331 --> 16:39.964
(tires squeal)

16:39.966 --> 16:42.433
Aw, geez, she's coming back!

16:42.435 --> 16:44.469
Run, bullies, run!

16:56.850 --> 16:57.982
Look out, chicks.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.785
The silver fox
is coming to the henhouse.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.553
(tires screeching)

17:02.555 --> 17:03.821
(shrieks)

17:05.492 --> 17:08.793
(panting)
I'm okay, I'm okay.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.062
(coughs)

17:13.433 --> 17:14.665
Brambles!

17:14.667 --> 17:15.566
(frustrated growls)

17:15.568 --> 17:18.736
("Mrs. Gulch's Theme"
fromThe Wizard of Ozplays)

17:18.738 --> 17:21.205
(frustrated grunts)

17:23.176 --> 17:25.376
(exhaust fan turns on)

17:25.378 --> 17:28.413
(Marge cries out,
cats yowling)

17:28.415 --> 17:31.282
Shoo! Shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo, shoo!

17:36.656 --> 17:39.057
I'm looking for Homer Simpson.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.892
What, did he eat
your candy house

17:40.894 --> 17:42.193
and push you into the oven?

17:42.195 --> 17:45.229
Odd, that's what the valet
just asked me.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.164
How ya doin'?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.199
Nice to see ya.
Life is good?

17:48.201 --> 17:49.967
Can't complain.
Can't or won't?

17:49.969 --> 17:53.438
You just crossed
a line, pally. Mm.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.840
(dance music plays)

17:55.842 --> 17:56.507
Oh, Homer,

17:56.509 --> 18:00.111
I've never seen a drunk
hold his vomit like you.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.446
(playful roar)

18:01.448 --> 18:03.714
(tipsy):
I do keep it together.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.349
(chuckles)

18:05.351 --> 18:06.350
Oh. Who is that?

18:06.352 --> 18:07.485
I don't know,
but she looks...

18:07.487 --> 18:10.388
Uh-oh. Usually when
it gets this quiet

18:10.390 --> 18:12.523
Mr. Burns is standing behind me.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.559
Actually, I'm standing
in front of you.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.561
I decided to hit
the local nighteries

18:16.563 --> 18:17.995
with my trusted wingman.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.864
(British accent):
I flew the first packet

18:19.866 --> 18:22.533
of royal mail across
the Khyber Pass,

18:22.535 --> 18:25.369
dodging the
poison-tipped spears

18:25.371 --> 18:27.205
of the dreaded
Zim-Zam Tribe.

18:27.207 --> 18:27.572
(chuckles)

18:27.574 --> 18:30.408
So, which of you wants
to be the sliced haddock

18:30.410 --> 18:31.409
in a geezer sandwich?

18:31.411 --> 18:35.546
Hmm. There's a lot of beefcake
on the grill tonight.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.949
Get your hands off my husband!

18:37.951 --> 18:38.883
(shrieks)

18:38.885 --> 18:42.420
This is a situation I call
"The Doctor Is Out."

18:42.422 --> 18:44.255
Marge, what are
you doing here?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.858
This bar is for singles
and wingmen only.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.025
That's your wife?

18:48.027 --> 18:52.029
Do you see her
as we see her?

18:52.031 --> 18:53.598
(angry growling)

18:53.600 --> 18:54.866
(grunts)

18:54.868 --> 18:56.067
(women scream)

18:56.069 --> 18:56.834
(grunts)

18:56.836 --> 18:59.237
Marge, Marge, put
down that broom.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.974
You've got nothing to be
afraid of from them.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.375
I'm a wingman.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.010
Part of a great tradition

19:06.012 --> 19:08.012
including Val Kilmer
from Top Gun,

19:08.014 --> 19:12.183
Wedge Antilles from Star Wars,
and me, from now.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.986
And you know why
I'm a great wingman?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.320
Because I have
the confidence

19:16.322 --> 19:21.058
that comes from knowing
I get to go home to you.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.260
Oh.

19:22.262 --> 19:22.527
(sniffs)

19:22.529 --> 19:26.130
And you know what else this
whole experience has taught me?

19:26.132 --> 19:29.433
True beauty
isn't about hair color?

19:29.435 --> 19:30.668
Probably.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.602
But be honest...

19:31.604 --> 19:36.274
when I say "beautiful woman,"
what pops into your head?

19:41.481 --> 19:45.049
Well, I guess I do
have a type.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.290
Mom, your choice to go back
to blue is so empowering.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.660
But you said going from
blue to gray was empowering.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.528
Well, as a feminist,
virtually anything

19:57.530 --> 20:00.031
a woman does is empowering.
Oh.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.867
Is my job creating power,
empowering?

20:02.869 --> 20:05.369
No. It's oddly
dehumanizing.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.172
Hey, Dad, did you
color your hair, too?

20:08.174 --> 20:08.906
(laughing)

20:08.908 --> 20:12.410
Only my hairdresser
knows for sure.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.446
Oh, hello, young man!

20:15.448 --> 20:17.081
Where's your father?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.183
He's dying
in a retirement home.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.385
Now kiss me.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.821
("Love Is Blue" plays)

20:40.673 --> 20:44.942
(Wicked Witch of the West theme)

21:22.315 --> 21:24.515
Shh!
