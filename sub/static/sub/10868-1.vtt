01:49.375 --> 01:51.545
I love spring in the Ice Age.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.692
Oh, the colors, the changing of seasons!

01:56.916 --> 01:59.303
Yeah, I hardly recognize the place.

01:59.403 --> 02:03.024
Of course, spring doesn't really start
until the eggs hatch. And...

02:03.124 --> 02:06.193
And you can't start Easter
without our Easter feast.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.445
That's right,
with the family all together.

02:08.544 --> 02:13.142
Which sounds amazing!
But I made plans with my friends.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.869
Someday you're gonna have
a family of your own,

02:15.969 --> 02:19.440
and then you'll know the importance of
getting everyone together on the holidays.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.851
I don't even know if I want that.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.880
Manny, come out here!
Your daughter is talking nonsense!

02:26.980 --> 02:31.518
Honey! I'm in my Manny cave
watching the Hawks-Bears game.

02:31.618 --> 02:34.096
I'll help when I get back.

02:34.987 --> 02:36.833
Promise.

02:40.092 --> 02:43.794
- Come on, Hawks!
- <i>This is it, folks, it's sudden death.</i>

02:44.564 --> 02:47.968
- Guys, every time?
- <i>They're in formation and here they go!</i>

02:48.068 --> 02:49.870
Bears rule!

02:49.970 --> 02:52.806
- Hawks on the attack!
- <i>Here comes Fuzzy Wuzzy. He...</i>

02:52.906 --> 02:56.109
- <i>Holy mastodon!</i>
- That was sudden!

02:56.209 --> 02:58.794
Game over. Hawks lose.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.216
Why don't you guys go help
your sister with the Easter feast?

03:02.316 --> 03:06.369
Easter, schmeaster, chicken keister!
Possums are launching our own holiday.

03:06.469 --> 03:11.325
April possum day! A celebration
of all things prank and possum.

03:11.425 --> 03:15.386
If it's about you guys,
why not call it April fools'?

03:15.486 --> 03:19.767
- I like it.
- Now, who will be the first fool?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.653
- Peaches!
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

03:22.753 --> 03:26.674
Manny! I could use another trunk up here!

03:26.774 --> 03:29.101
Let's go watch the Falcons-Hornets
game at your den.

03:29.201 --> 03:32.671
Yeah, but Shira's sleeping. She went
out all night hunting with the girls.

03:32.771 --> 03:36.234
The Cougars? Fine, we'll watch at Sid's.
Bring the nose plugs.

03:39.877 --> 03:43.628
Guys, I'm touched you want
to watch the game with me, but...

03:44.715 --> 03:48.487
I can't because, you see,
it's my grand opening!

03:48.587 --> 03:50.423
Nothing about you is grand, Sid.

03:50.523 --> 03:53.233
Well, if you recall,
I once ran a kid's camp,

03:53.333 --> 03:55.561
- El campo del Sid.
- Disaster.

03:55.661 --> 03:58.497
And then I nurtured
three beautiful dinosaur eggs.

03:58.597 --> 04:00.443
- Disaster.
- And then I thought,

04:00.543 --> 04:03.469
who has time to sit on their egg all day?

04:03.569 --> 04:07.292
Me! So, I'm opening
a pre-hatched pre-school.

04:07.392 --> 04:10.378
Egg sitting. I sit on your egg.

04:10.478 --> 04:12.698
Future disaster.

04:12.798 --> 04:16.415
And not one single parent
has entrusted their egg to you yet.

04:16.515 --> 04:20.262
No, can you believe that?
And I asked everyone, too.

04:21.185 --> 04:24.089
Asher, stop sniffing him.
It's embarrassing!

04:24.189 --> 04:26.016
Except her!

04:26.967 --> 04:29.409
Please, give me strength.

04:29.509 --> 04:32.164
Don't eat that, it's already digested.

04:32.264 --> 04:35.802
Excuse me, ma'am? I can't help
noticing that you just migrated...

04:35.902 --> 04:39.471
- Savannah!
- ...so you know nothing about me.

04:40.110 --> 04:43.275
- Savan... Rachel!
- It wasn't me!

04:43.375 --> 04:47.105
The skinny one! Spit your brother out!
Right now! What on earth are you saying?

04:47.205 --> 04:50.749
I know it's hard to manage, what,
with today's two-hunter families.

04:50.849 --> 04:53.385
Only one hunter here.
My mate flew the coop.

04:53.485 --> 04:54.736
- That's great!
- What?

04:54.836 --> 04:58.023
I mean... I mean, I feel your pain.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.525
So, let me ask you...

04:59.625 --> 05:03.862
who'll watch your egg while you scavenge
to feed your young mouth to mouths?

05:03.962 --> 05:05.798
I'm basically your only option.

05:05.898 --> 05:08.977
And really, think about it.
What could possibly go wrong?

05:12.069 --> 05:14.373
Yo, I been stuck down here
for three months hangin' out.

05:14.473 --> 05:17.742
I got my sea legs back. Time to set sail!

05:17.842 --> 05:20.746
Come on, you just got home! Stay!

05:20.846 --> 05:24.983
We got it made here.
We sleep all day, we game all night.

05:25.083 --> 05:27.720
Mom, like, she picks up
all our droppings, dude.

05:27.820 --> 05:31.223
- Can one of you take out the trash?
- Mom! In a minute!

05:31.323 --> 05:34.126
I'm busy! I love that woman.

05:34.226 --> 05:36.628
Clint! This hole is your whole universe.

05:36.728 --> 05:40.499
And that's cool. You're a late bloomer.
Whatever. I am a pirate. I don't judge.

05:40.599 --> 05:43.335
But there's a whole world
out there to pillage and plunder.

05:43.435 --> 05:46.605
You can sit here with your late bloomin',
I'mma get to pillage and plunderin'.

05:46.705 --> 05:48.273
Okay... well...

05:48.373 --> 05:52.077
You know, every time you scheme something,
you end up back here, at rock bottom.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.650
Yeah, but this time's gonna be different.
I'm gonna bounce.

05:57.948 --> 05:59.694
Here we go! What?

06:01.419 --> 06:03.497
It's them!

06:04.288 --> 06:05.994
Watch out!

06:06.094 --> 06:08.060
They sank my ship!

06:08.160 --> 06:12.173
All because I tried to kidnap and...
well, maybe dump 'em at sea.

06:14.198 --> 06:16.867
Anti-pirate jerks.

06:16.967 --> 06:20.272
- Payback time.
- If you're going out, take your brother!

06:20.372 --> 06:23.296
Mom! I'm not taking him!

06:24.175 --> 06:27.312
Of course I have space for little Jessica!

06:27.412 --> 06:28.814
My motto is...

06:28.914 --> 06:33.273
"Long as you've got an egg,
I've got a place to sit."

06:33.919 --> 06:35.276
Next!

06:36.753 --> 06:38.724
- Who referred you?
- Ethel did.

06:38.824 --> 06:42.461
She said you had the most
trustworthy eye she's ever seen.

06:42.561 --> 06:47.620
You see, my little egg is
my whole life, my miracle.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.770
Well, yeah! I should say so.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.197
- So, how did you...
- I adopted.

06:58.075 --> 07:01.614
Sid's got a dozen eggs in his care.
This is not gonna go over easy.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.783
It's like the future of the ecosystem
is in Sid's hands.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.874
Worse. It's under Sid's butt.

07:10.789 --> 07:13.114
Hey! You hose-faced, trunk-toothed beast!

07:13.264 --> 07:16.211
- Remember me?
- Peter Cottontail?

07:16.311 --> 07:19.848
That is insulting to my species!
I'm here for the new ship you owe me!

07:19.948 --> 07:22.701
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, let me refresh your memory.

07:22.801 --> 07:25.937
Last time we met, you beat,
outsmarted, and humiliated me.

07:26.037 --> 07:28.474
So the way I see it,
you owe me a new ship.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.365
Beat it, bunny. I don't owe you bupkis.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.117
- What is he doing?
- I think... he's attacking you?

07:39.217 --> 07:42.409
Attacking? Exfoliating, maybe.

07:44.321 --> 07:48.348
Y'all haven't heard the last of me!
I'll be back for my new ship!

07:51.712 --> 07:53.515
Nap time!

07:53.615 --> 07:57.448
Oh, my gosh, you're so cute!

07:57.768 --> 08:01.006
Sleep, sleep.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.410
You want back tickles?
Oh, you have a big day tomorrow!

08:04.510 --> 08:07.612
Now, how are you gonna come
outta your shell if you don't rest?

08:07.712 --> 08:09.315
Oh, I know! I know, I know.

08:09.415 --> 08:12.250
I'll tell you the story my mom
used to tell me all the time.

08:12.350 --> 08:14.486
It puts me right to sleep.

08:14.586 --> 08:18.478
Okay. "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall..."

08:20.691 --> 08:24.145
And the lucky bunny stole them all.

08:26.697 --> 08:28.321
Oh, you're poached!

08:29.834 --> 08:32.265
"And all the king's horses
and all the king's..."

08:33.804 --> 08:36.462
Oh, I like your sunny side.
I'm gonna put you up!

08:38.142 --> 08:39.600
Egg roll!

08:46.917 --> 08:52.112
Tomorrow I'm gonna cash in my nest egg
for a big ol' pirate ship to sail away in!

08:56.761 --> 09:00.115
First pranking is a rite
of passage for every possum.

09:00.215 --> 09:03.168
Peaches gets to be the first
April fool in history.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.804
She's gonna be so happy.

09:06.106 --> 09:08.228
Here she comes!

09:08.706 --> 09:10.681
We're the best uncles ever!

09:15.646 --> 09:17.137
But I...

09:17.237 --> 09:21.219
I don't get it! We set a vicious
booby trap for our niece.

09:21.319 --> 09:24.990
We did everything right here!
Maybe your glue's no good.

09:25.090 --> 09:27.613
Told you my glue is good!

09:29.760 --> 09:31.652
- Crash?
- What's happening?

09:32.896 --> 09:34.631
Eddie?

09:34.731 --> 09:36.871
- Stop it!
- You stop it!

09:37.301 --> 09:39.310
- It's good glue.
- Thank you.

09:39.410 --> 09:41.628
It's incredible!

09:47.744 --> 09:50.115
Where are our eggs?

09:50.215 --> 09:52.450
I don't think he knows where the eggs are.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.620
Well, maybe it's senior ditch day.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.422
How is that even possible?

09:57.522 --> 10:00.592
I mean, they are deceptively
quick for oblongs.

10:00.692 --> 10:03.061
You close your eyes for one second
and they wobble off.

10:03.161 --> 10:06.955
- You lost them?
- I trusted you with my egg!

10:07.055 --> 10:08.967
And I got them to trust you too!

10:09.067 --> 10:11.903
Do you have any idea,
as a single-parent dad...

10:12.003 --> 10:14.239
the hoops they made me
jump through to adopt?

10:14.339 --> 10:15.874
It took me all day to lay my eggs!

10:15.974 --> 10:19.077
Have you ever given birth to something
that weighs half a ton?

10:19.377 --> 10:23.514
No. Sadly, nature hasn't seen it fit

10:23.614 --> 10:25.747
to bless me with that experience.

10:26.017 --> 10:29.609
Well, you're about
to find out how it feels.

10:30.053 --> 10:31.788
Pull!

10:31.888 --> 10:35.527
Go ahead. I deserve it.

10:36.127 --> 10:39.852
Please release the sloth.

10:40.114 --> 10:43.235
Look, look, we'll find your eggs
and we'll get 'em back by morning.

10:43.335 --> 10:45.692
Or you can draw and quarter him tomorrow.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.305
I'm not saying they should.

10:47.405 --> 10:51.076
- Can we tar and feather him?
- No! It'll get all over my cave.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.712
- What if we feed him to the reptile!
- Get that horny toad!

10:53.812 --> 10:57.919
Look, I appreciate your ideas,
but Sid didn't take your eggs!

10:58.019 --> 11:00.618
- Then who did?
- Hey, look!

11:00.718 --> 11:03.689
- We found something!
- It's a ransom note.

11:03.789 --> 11:08.193
Get me a ship by tomorrow
or the eggs get scrambled.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.895
The pirate took our eggs!

11:09.995 --> 11:13.432
- You brought this trouble here.
- Just give him a new ship!

11:13.532 --> 11:16.434
We can't negotiate with a pirate.
He'll just keep doing it.

11:16.534 --> 11:18.103
Wait, wait!

11:18.203 --> 11:21.561
- It's the pirate! Get him!
- He's got our eggs!

11:22.573 --> 11:26.099
Wait, wait, wait, no, I'm not him!
That's my brother.

11:26.443 --> 11:29.047
No, he hid this! In our rabbit hole.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.416
It's a treasure map to the eggs.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.585
You see, pirates,
they like to hide things,

11:33.685 --> 11:36.688
and draw maps to find them,
like, later. I don't know.

11:36.788 --> 11:39.875
I know what pirates do.
Why did you bring this to us?

11:39.975 --> 11:43.528
My family's made its hole
in this valley for 13 generations.

11:43.628 --> 11:45.427
That's almost four years!

11:45.527 --> 11:48.615
For once, I gotta make things right.
You know?

11:48.965 --> 11:52.159
For my family.
We gotta get those eggs back.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.015
I napped, and they got egg-napped.

11:59.144 --> 12:02.314
Manny, we have to help those families.

12:02.664 --> 12:05.989
Sid, this is your chance
to make things right.

12:06.516 --> 12:10.077
Thanks, Ellie.
You're wise beyond your size.

12:11.488 --> 12:13.291
Okay, we got ourselves an egg hunt!

12:13.391 --> 12:16.828
Let's search every tree hole, rabbit hole,
watering hole, and ice hole

12:16.928 --> 12:18.996
in this entire valley.

12:19.096 --> 12:22.088
We'll find 'em. I promise.

12:27.003 --> 12:30.061
- Hey, don't you want to follow the map?
- Map, schmap.

12:30.161 --> 12:33.678
We have a D.T.S. Diego tracking system.

12:33.778 --> 12:36.781
My nose, and these instincts, can't miss.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.340
They just did.

12:39.551 --> 12:44.121
According to this map we don't need,
there should be one right...

12:44.671 --> 12:48.125
Here! Eggs marks the spot.

12:48.225 --> 12:52.653
Painting and hiding eggs? It's insidious.
Who would do such a thing?

12:57.868 --> 13:01.038
This is like finding
an ice cube in a glacier.

13:01.138 --> 13:03.563
I found another one.

13:06.810 --> 13:10.069
All right, a little more to the left.
No, center.

13:12.849 --> 13:15.731
Okay, to the right, to the right.
Okay, no, no, no, no.

13:18.189 --> 13:21.299
Okay, a little more to the left,
a little south, a little south.

13:32.569 --> 13:36.462
It's chocolate.
Should weigh just about the same.

13:44.582 --> 13:47.974
Who knew that chocolate
tastes best in egg form?

13:50.219 --> 13:52.078
Sid!

14:02.566 --> 14:05.202
Yeah! We got 'em all!

14:06.202 --> 14:10.592
Clint! Finally got off your cottontail
just to bite me in the back.

14:11.708 --> 14:15.246
Okay. Those traps are on a hare-trigger.

14:15.346 --> 14:18.383
One goes off, they all go off!

14:18.483 --> 14:20.817
Soon as she comes up, pow!

14:20.917 --> 14:23.755
Genius! But why would she come here?

14:23.855 --> 14:27.824
- Simple. I left her a note.
- This note?

14:27.924 --> 14:29.516
Shoot.

14:30.294 --> 14:33.453
Looks like we might be here for a while!

14:45.341 --> 14:48.613
My baby! My little miracle!

14:48.713 --> 14:51.249
I am not your miracle.
Could you just put me down?

14:51.349 --> 14:54.786
We can't panic like this.
We've gotta panic like this!

14:54.886 --> 14:59.057
We're never gonna see our eggs again!
We gotta build him that ship.

14:59.157 --> 15:01.959
I know you're worried about your families.
I've been there.

15:02.059 --> 15:04.929
But my guys always come through.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.553
Look! It's them!

15:12.395 --> 15:14.426
They're back!

15:16.139 --> 15:18.309
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

15:18.409 --> 15:22.614
Neither ice, nor more ice,
nor dark of night...

15:22.714 --> 15:26.406
would keep us from returning
every last egg.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.819
Except yours.

15:29.119 --> 15:32.998
- My egg's missing?
- But we found every egg on the map!

15:33.099 --> 15:36.027
Oh, no. My poor little egg!

15:36.127 --> 15:39.160
Never even got a chance to drive me crazy!

15:39.260 --> 15:42.341
Oh, why? Why me?

15:42.441 --> 15:46.846
You fools! Oh, you really think
I'm gonna put all my eggs in one basket?

15:47.638 --> 15:50.108
You have until sunrise to build me my ship

15:50.208 --> 15:52.910
if you ever want to see
your precious egg again!

15:53.960 --> 15:55.879
Oh, no!

15:55.979 --> 15:58.383
It's one hour to sunrise.
We're not gonna make it.

15:58.483 --> 16:01.386
We still got an hour. Our hour.

16:01.486 --> 16:03.304
Hour hour? So that's two hours.

16:03.404 --> 16:07.408
No, it's the hour that belongs to us!

16:07.558 --> 16:11.129
Look, despite new evidence that suggests
I should not work in child care,

16:11.229 --> 16:16.087
when we work together,
we can fix any mistake I make.

16:16.187 --> 16:20.343
Sid's right. Look, we had a setback.
Let's start over and get this done.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.829
Count me in.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.820
Dude, stop, all right?
This is kind of getting out of hand.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.472
I'm not giving up that egg, Clint,
not without a ship.

16:37.572 --> 16:39.908
What about our home? Our family?

16:40.258 --> 16:43.278
What about us? Your own fluff and blood.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.946
You gave up on loyalty
the moment you gave up my map!

16:46.046 --> 16:49.851
We're bunnies! Okay?
We're soft, we're cute, we're cuddly.

16:49.951 --> 16:52.253
We got button noses and fluffy tails,

16:52.353 --> 16:55.790
hand-crafted by nature
to make everybody go...

16:55.940 --> 16:58.943
And you found a way to make the whole
animal kingdom hate us in one day!

16:59.043 --> 17:01.045
You need everyone to love you! Here's you.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.082
"Oh, that's okay,
I don't need to be tough and strong.

17:04.182 --> 17:07.451
"I'll go hide in a hole."
That's you. Here's me.

17:07.550 --> 17:09.328
I win!

17:09.428 --> 17:11.248
Well, fine.

17:11.348 --> 17:14.192
Have it your way. They built you a ship.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.944
They're doin'... they're buildin'...
they're building it?

17:21.765 --> 17:25.548
If you think I'm gonna tell you
where that egg is, you're nuts.

17:27.103 --> 17:28.928
The egg!

17:46.856 --> 17:47.925
No!

17:48.225 --> 17:50.449
I got it, I got it!

17:52.395 --> 17:54.086
My nest egg!

17:56.132 --> 17:57.991
- Head's up!
- Come on!

18:03.406 --> 18:05.432
Surprise!

18:08.978 --> 18:11.470
Oh, please!

18:13.683 --> 18:15.541
Got it!

18:19.957 --> 18:22.848
Did you see that? I got it!

18:24.660 --> 18:26.518
My egg!

18:27.697 --> 18:30.123
- Sid!
- Sneak attack!

18:38.241 --> 18:40.232
Do-si-do!

18:41.895 --> 18:43.497
Spring thaw!

18:44.147 --> 18:45.672
The ice is melting!

18:50.425 --> 18:53.313
- Give me that egg!
- Sid!

18:59.229 --> 19:00.853
Darn bunny tail!

19:09.907 --> 19:12.843
You're the first April fool!

19:13.343 --> 19:15.345
We did it!

19:22.385 --> 19:25.189
- Mama.
- Thank you!

19:25.289 --> 19:28.359
Savannah!
Come look at your little brother.

19:29.571 --> 19:31.917
He's so cute!

19:32.796 --> 19:37.023
Oh, my goodness,
aren't you the most beautiful thing?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.405
My miracle!

19:42.105 --> 19:44.997
Mom! Look!

19:46.776 --> 19:48.679
Come here.

19:48.779 --> 19:51.796
Peaches? Are you crying?

19:52.315 --> 19:55.353
You got me. Family's cool.

19:55.453 --> 19:57.738
You might even get to be
a grand-mammoth someday.

19:57.838 --> 20:00.592
- Manny, come out here.
- What? What's wrong?

20:00.692 --> 20:03.394
Your daughter's finally
starting to make sense.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.964
Okay, I know you want to be
with your friends.

20:06.064 --> 20:09.000
And I know the eagles show is starting.
Go watch with Diego.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.601
- No way.
- Yeah, Mom.

20:10.701 --> 20:14.492
We're having Easter feast all together.
As a family.

20:14.592 --> 20:17.830
You know, it was kind of fun
having an egg hunt.

20:18.642 --> 20:21.779
Maybe we should paint eggs
and hide 'em every year!

20:21.979 --> 20:24.315
Hey, you know what?
You're awesome with eggs.

20:24.415 --> 20:28.869
Now, what do you think of this?
The Easter... bunny!

20:28.969 --> 20:32.407
You mean like a job?
Would I have to wear a stiff suit?

20:32.757 --> 20:35.992
No, your birthday suit is perfect.

20:36.092 --> 20:40.152
Mom, I got a job!

20:40.764 --> 20:43.233
What do bunnies have to do with Easter?

20:43.333 --> 20:47.305
Or eggs. Or painting.
I'm sorry, that could never catch on.

20:47.405 --> 20:51.364
Oh, I'm gonna get business cards.
I'm the Easter bunny!

21:05.878 --> 21:07.679
Perfect!

21:14.164 --> 21:16.967
The ship is terrible! Not seaworthy!

21:17.067 --> 21:19.124
Bunny overboard!

27:53.367 --> 27:55.253
Oh, no!

28:58.528 --> 29:00.664
Hey, look, shooting stars.

29:00.764 --> 29:04.803
Quick, quick, make a wish, make a wish.
You gotta make a wish.

29:06.462 --> 29:09.895
- My wish came true.
- I'm okay!

29:10.973 --> 29:12.231
Mine too.

29:13.493 --> 29:15.885
I think I burned my marshmallows.

42:31.940 --> 42:35.253
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

46:57.406 --> 46:59.497
Goal!

50:11.966 --> 50:14.599
Welcome aboard, mate.

50:21.142 --> 50:26.446
- Hey, this cruise has entertainment.
- Seriously? Sid, you're out of your mind.

50:49.737 --> 50:51.474
They left without me.

50:51.574 --> 50:56.249
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the sloth?

51:04.352 --> 51:06.777
Get off my face.

51:07.922 --> 51:11.694
You and me, we make a great team.
What do you say we just head south together?

51:11.794 --> 51:14.697
Great, yeah. Hey, jump up on my back
and relax the whole way.

51:14.797 --> 51:16.763
- Really?
- No.

51:16.863 --> 51:18.421
- I didn't get the name.
- Manfred.

51:18.521 --> 51:21.539
Manfred? Yuck. How about
Manny the moody mammoth?

51:21.639 --> 51:24.728
Or Manny the melancholy...

51:26.040 --> 51:28.511
His daddy wiped out half our pack

51:28.611 --> 51:31.079
and wears our skin to keep warm.

51:31.179 --> 51:33.905
An eye for an eye. And, Diego...

51:34.005 --> 51:36.991
bring me that baby alive.

51:42.490 --> 51:44.248
Go! Go!

52:08.016 --> 52:12.042
That's his herd right up the hill.
We should return him.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.378
Manny!

52:29.704 --> 52:33.167
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

52:33.267 --> 52:36.409
If you're looking for the humans, you're
wasting your time. They left this morning.

52:36.509 --> 52:40.182
- They couldn't be far.
- You don't know much about tracking, do you?

52:40.282 --> 52:42.706
They headed north two hours ago.

53:01.786 --> 53:04.389
You could have died, trying to save me.

53:04.739 --> 53:07.375
That's what you do in a herd.

53:07.475 --> 53:09.833
You look out for each other.

53:12.080 --> 53:15.910
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

53:19.187 --> 53:23.714
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

53:36.838 --> 53:38.974
You have to leave me here.

53:39.074 --> 53:43.078
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

53:53.254 --> 53:56.280
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

53:59.227 --> 54:01.230
Diego? You're okay!

54:01.330 --> 54:03.331
Nine lives, baby.

54:03.431 --> 54:05.935
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

54:06.035 --> 54:09.526
I'm telling you, I'll show you
all my favorite watering holes.

54:10.805 --> 54:12.575
Everything is melting.

54:12.675 --> 54:16.010
The dam's gonna break.
The entire valley's gonna flood.

54:16.110 --> 54:18.748
Look around. You're in a bowl.

54:18.848 --> 54:21.717
Bowl's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

54:21.817 --> 54:23.881
- What are we gonna do?
- Unless...

54:23.981 --> 54:26.555
you can make it to the end of the valley.

54:26.655 --> 54:30.414
There's a boat. It can save you.

54:39.401 --> 54:43.706
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

54:44.006 --> 54:48.265
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

54:49.744 --> 54:53.028
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

54:53.128 --> 54:55.251
That's right. These are my brothers.

54:55.351 --> 54:58.220
I don't think her tree goes
all the way to the top branch.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.756
Hey, she should come with us.

55:00.856 --> 55:03.507
Are you insane? No way.

55:03.607 --> 55:05.078
Okay.

55:05.178 --> 55:08.363
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

55:08.463 --> 55:12.233
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

55:12.333 --> 55:15.404
So, you think she's the girl for me?

55:15.504 --> 55:19.129
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

55:20.074 --> 55:24.323
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

55:29.517 --> 55:31.823
There's only one way to go. We go forward.

55:31.923 --> 55:33.582
- We go back.
- Forward.

55:33.682 --> 55:36.257
Back. Come on.

55:36.357 --> 55:38.148
Fine.

55:52.106 --> 55:55.129
Manny. It's Ellie,
she's trapped in a cave.

56:44.492 --> 56:47.797
Ellie, I don't want us to be together
because we have to.

56:48.097 --> 56:50.633
I want us to be together
because we want to.

56:50.733 --> 56:54.003
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.
What do you say?

56:54.103 --> 56:56.461
Oh, Manny, I thought you were going...

56:58.439 --> 57:00.731
You're possum enough for me.

57:01.542 --> 57:03.045
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!

57:03.145 --> 57:05.869
- Watch it!
- I'm having a baby!

57:07.364 --> 57:09.206
Manny?

57:09.517 --> 57:11.820
I told you it was just a kick.

57:11.920 --> 57:14.090
Sorry, folks! False alarm!

57:14.690 --> 57:18.994
I'd like to present Egbert,
Shelly and Yoko.

57:19.094 --> 57:23.286
Sid, whatever you're doing,
it's a bad idea.

57:26.500 --> 57:29.693
- Momma!
- I'm a mommy.

57:36.410 --> 57:38.835
- Sid!
- Sid!

57:39.013 --> 57:41.271
Help!

57:47.288 --> 57:49.479
Sid must be down there.

57:50.558 --> 57:53.462
We've been living above an entire world,

57:53.562 --> 57:55.697
and we didn't even know it.

57:55.797 --> 57:58.985
The name's Buck. Short for Buckminster.

57:59.833 --> 58:02.538
Long for "Buh."

58:02.738 --> 58:06.458
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.

58:06.558 --> 58:10.871
Well! He's dead. Welcome to my world.

58:22.023 --> 58:24.348
Wait! Sloth down!

58:25.627 --> 58:30.364
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbors.

58:36.737 --> 58:39.127
Hi, neighbor.

58:41.709 --> 58:43.445
- Rudy.
- Rudy?

58:43.545 --> 58:45.713
Peaches!

58:45.813 --> 58:47.749
Peaches?

58:47.849 --> 58:50.902
Peaches! The baby! What, now?

58:51.002 --> 58:52.564
This? Not good.

58:52.664 --> 58:54.928
Stranger danger!

59:00.995 --> 59:04.056
That's right! Come on!

59:05.666 --> 59:09.860
This is the end of Sid the sloth!

59:13.874 --> 59:16.044
- Help!
- No, Sid! It's me!

59:16.144 --> 59:17.912
- And me!
- And me!

59:18.412 --> 59:20.904
I think we're getting close.

59:32.460 --> 59:35.931
She looks just like her mother.
Thank goodness.

59:36.031 --> 59:37.733
It's good to have you back, Sid.

59:37.833 --> 59:41.469
Never thought I would say this,
but I missed you, buddy.

59:41.869 --> 59:45.194
All right, mammals, let's get you home.

59:52.680 --> 59:56.991
That's right, sweetheart.
Welcome to the Ice Age.

01:00:09.863 --> 01:00:11.921
What was that?

01:00:14.501 --> 01:00:16.926
I think we're almost there!

01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:25.113
I'll bury you all
and dance on your graves.

01:00:25.313 --> 01:00:26.315
So frail.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:29.774
And she can't wait
to spend time with you, Sid.

01:00:35.706 --> 01:00:38.331
Manny! No!

01:00:45.399 --> 01:00:50.286
No matter how long it takes,
I will find you!

01:00:52.874 --> 01:00:55.377
That wall is going
to keep moving and crush us.

01:00:55.477 --> 01:00:59.602
We need to get to the land bridge.
Any questions?

01:01:00.313 --> 01:01:01.383
Yes?

01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:05.800
When you drink water through your trunk,
does it taste like boogers?

01:01:06.355 --> 01:01:10.280
No. Well, sometimes. Let's move!

01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:19.874
Am I hallucinating, or is that ice
coming straight towards us?

01:01:24.972 --> 01:01:27.509
Captain Gutt, here to help.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:30.145
You know, that's a nice monkey.

01:01:30.245 --> 01:01:32.470
Lights out, big fella.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:42.057
Hey, buddy. Welcome to the party.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.559
- Prepare the plank!
- Prepare the plank!

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.885
Preparing the plank!

01:01:48.863 --> 01:01:50.820
Ain't going to happen, captain.

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.046
Does anyone have floaties?

01:02:00.408 --> 01:02:03.345
There! Land!

01:02:03.445 --> 01:02:06.140
Everyone paddle. Paddle!

01:02:08.949 --> 01:02:12.619
Guys, over here. Come on, it's a shortcut.

01:02:13.369 --> 01:02:16.528
That is amazing.

01:02:24.431 --> 01:02:26.434
Guys, we should get out of here.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:29.793
- This is epic!
- Go! Go! Go!

01:02:37.245 --> 01:02:39.998
Hey, Peach, loosen up! Have some fun.

01:02:40.098 --> 01:02:41.800
Fun? I'm out of here.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:46.001
If you geniuses are normal,
this species is going to end up extinct.

01:02:46.421 --> 01:02:49.891
Yeah, well, your species
is going to be extinct first.

01:02:49.991 --> 01:02:53.528
- Burn!
- We're the same species, genius.

01:02:53.628 --> 01:02:56.286
What? Double burn.

01:02:58.432 --> 01:03:00.868
- Is that...?
- Peaches? There she is!

01:03:00.968 --> 01:03:01.972
Dad!

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:10.812
- Go, go, I'm right behind you.
- No!

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.900
I'm right behind you.

01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:15.016
Dad!

01:03:15.266 --> 01:03:16.968
No!

01:03:17.068 --> 01:03:19.620
There's nowhere to run, Manny.

01:03:22.907 --> 01:03:26.215
Sometimes, it pays to weigh eleven tons!

01:03:26.315 --> 01:03:27.195
No!

01:03:27.295 --> 01:03:30.587
Bon voyage, monkey boy!

01:03:35.136 --> 01:03:37.894
Did somebody hail a whale?

01:03:45.446 --> 01:03:47.941
How's that for an entrance?

01:04:46.874 --> 01:04:50.612
During moviemaking sometimes you find
characters that really stand out

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:53.865
and become this happy surprise
in the story,

01:04:53.965 --> 01:04:55.450
and Scrat was one of them.

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:59.754
Scrat was one of the characters
that we developed for Ice Age 1.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:03.441
And it came from a need to find
an opening sequence for the movie.

01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:05.424
We went through Peter's drawings,
and there it was.

01:05:05.524 --> 01:05:10.199
We added the saber-teeth and we gave him
an acorn, and this whole issue was born.

01:05:10.299 --> 01:05:14.536
And that's when the idea of that glacier
sequence became the opening of the movie.

01:05:14.636 --> 01:05:16.905
Very simple storyline, no dialogue.

01:05:17.005 --> 01:05:19.408
Just having this little character just...

01:05:19.508 --> 01:05:23.578
run for his life with one thing in mind,
the nut. People just loved it.

01:05:23.678 --> 01:05:28.183
Everybody who saw this sequence just
could so identify with this poor little guy,

01:05:28.283 --> 01:05:30.785
that he just got a life of his own,

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.388
and we just ended up using him
throughout all three movies.

01:05:33.488 --> 01:05:37.626
Scrat sequences are a dream, in a way,
because it is pure animation,

01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:42.564
just to have fun and do slapstick
and not be tied down by dialogue.

01:05:42.664 --> 01:05:46.368
But after three movies,
it does get challenging because...

01:05:46.468 --> 01:05:49.893
"So, okay, what have we not done
with this guy?"

01:05:51.873 --> 01:05:56.143
The most important thing
in Scrat's universe is his acorn.

01:05:56.443 --> 01:05:58.280
That's all he cares about.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.416
And writers came up
with something brilliant

01:06:01.516 --> 01:06:05.353
by coming up with the one thing that
could possibly compete with that,

01:06:05.453 --> 01:06:07.089
and that's Scratte.

01:06:07.189 --> 01:06:10.571
Scratte is the perfect foil because...

01:06:11.071 --> 01:06:15.752
she's beautiful, she's cunning,
she's everything that he isn't.

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:26.641
When I was designing Scratte, I knew
she had to be the opposite of Scrat.

01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:29.687
So she had to be beautiful.
She had to be smart.

01:06:29.787 --> 01:06:31.146
All the things that he's not.

01:06:31.246 --> 01:06:35.883
Scrat is this nervous, twitchy character,

01:06:35.983 --> 01:06:38.508
not particularly well-groomed.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.924
She's elegant and smooth.

01:06:42.024 --> 01:06:44.492
We just wanted her to look
as beautiful as she could be,

01:06:44.592 --> 01:06:47.462
because Scrat has to look at her
and just fall in love immediately.

01:06:47.562 --> 01:06:50.765
So we gave her long eyelashes
with a little bit of blue,

01:06:50.865 --> 01:06:53.223
so we just make her
really feminine and funny.

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:01.309
Scratte did start out being
a lot more instinctual,

01:07:01.409 --> 01:07:04.046
and then we started seeing her look,

01:07:04.146 --> 01:07:06.448
playing against Scrat
actually worked a lot better.

01:07:06.548 --> 01:07:09.683
And that's where it started
to mold her personality.

01:07:09.783 --> 01:07:13.822
Her movement is really different because
she's very straight with her poses.

01:07:13.922 --> 01:07:16.224
Scrat will pop and just jerk
into the motion.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:18.559
She'll do a swirl.

01:07:18.659 --> 01:07:23.448
The uglier and the more disheveled and
pathetic you get Scrat, the funnier he is.

01:07:23.548 --> 01:07:26.235
But you always have to make sure
she's looking as good as possible,

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:29.893
and that's where the comedy is,
the contrast between the two.

01:07:30.739 --> 01:07:33.875
And we kind of thought,
what if both Scrat and Scratte

01:07:33.975 --> 01:07:36.411
have the same goal, the nut.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:40.315
Like, we can create this great fun little
kind of spy vs spy kind of thing

01:07:40.415 --> 01:07:43.085
that they keep trying to outsmart
each other to catch the nut.

01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:46.876
And then, therefore by doing that,
they find love.

01:07:47.088 --> 01:07:51.793
Then, the concept came up, the love
triangle, Scrat, nut and girl, Scratte.

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:54.446
The Scrat sequences in general
are not scripted.

01:07:54.546 --> 01:07:58.967
They are all invented in story
and with the director.

01:07:59.067 --> 01:08:03.405
Carlos definitely had the idea
of the Scrat arc, meeting the girl

01:08:03.505 --> 01:08:05.941
and a basic idea of what would happen.

01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:10.667
But as far as every individual sequence,
they leave it to us.

01:08:13.647 --> 01:08:15.917
The first thing we do
is a first rough pass.

01:08:16.017 --> 01:08:19.754
Rough, dirty awful looking drawings, and then
you pitch them in front of the whole room.

01:08:19.854 --> 01:08:23.591
You act it out. You do voices.
You're really trying to get the room to laugh.

01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:25.415
And then falls like a rock.

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:33.469
The Scrat tango sequence, that was
my assignment. And I thought, "Well...

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:37.005
okay. They need to be fighting over the nut.
"It's gotta be fun and funny and..."

01:08:37.205 --> 01:08:40.341
So, then, the next part was me just trying
to sketch out the choreography,

01:08:40.442 --> 01:08:44.813
seeing how it would work with their tails,
and bringing squirrelness into a human dance.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:46.881
Just weeks of just doing gags.

01:08:46.982 --> 01:08:51.620
And then Carlos basically just picks
his favorite, and the tango was born.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.689
The tango sequence took 33 days,
about five weeks,

01:08:54.788 --> 01:08:57.292
because there was a lot of play
between who is holding the nut,

01:08:57.392 --> 01:08:59.694
where it's going, so it takes
a great deal of Polish time.

01:08:59.794 --> 01:09:02.630
We looked up on YouTube
how to dance tango,

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:06.000
and I think one of the coolest responses
was when the storyboard artists noticed

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.071
I did a backwards ocho
in one of the shots I did.

01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:11.740
So, actually, I have very
specific tango moves in this.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.743
It's all a collaborative effort
that made that sequence extremely painful

01:09:14.843 --> 01:09:16.678
but extremely rewarding at the same time.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.846
It's one of my favorite sequences
in the movie.

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:23.171
It just shows how fun
and painful love can be.

01:09:23.685 --> 01:09:25.920
One thing about the original
Scrat was thinking,

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.591
"what's gonna be the voice for Scrat?"
So, we just put temporary voices just to see.

01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:30.925
We needed some sounds.

01:09:31.024 --> 01:09:35.084
So, I connected with my inner Scrat,

01:09:35.412 --> 01:09:37.982
and the noises just came voluntarily.

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:39.935
Mostly, it's effort sounds.

01:09:40.035 --> 01:09:45.666
Scrat, you know, gets surprised
by something, it's kind of...

01:09:49.042 --> 01:09:53.169
He's getting bopped on the head,
it's kind of the same sound, only just...

01:09:54.931 --> 01:09:56.923
Things like that.

01:10:01.089 --> 01:10:05.727
It matched so perfectly. We said, "why look
elsewhere? We got the talent right here."

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:10.353
And Chris became the signature voice
of Scrat and was wonderful.

01:10:11.099 --> 01:10:14.736
And then when we defined the Scrat girl,
I decided, "let's look inside again.

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:16.838
"Let's go through the same process."

01:10:16.938 --> 01:10:20.976
And Karen Disher, she'd been doing
a lot of voice temps for us.

01:10:21.076 --> 01:10:23.111
I've been doing scratch voices
since I started out.

01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:26.675
So, I think when they needed
a temp voice for Scratte

01:10:26.775 --> 01:10:29.851
at the beginning of production,
they were like, "we'll just bring Karen in,"

01:10:29.951 --> 01:10:32.220
which is, for me, a lot of fun,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.279
when you can come into the booth and they're
like, "okay, you're falling down a cliff."

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:38.426
You know, "you're being punched
in the stomach."

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:42.085
You know, it's a funny and weird thing.

01:10:43.715 --> 01:10:47.335
In terms of vocalizing,
it's tricky because Scrat's so great.

01:10:47.435 --> 01:10:50.071
Chris Wedge does such an amazing voice.

01:10:50.171 --> 01:10:54.783
So, how do I keep this animal in the same
family, but different at the same time?

01:10:54.883 --> 01:11:01.024
So, for me, that was thinking of little sexy
things like, little purrs she could do,

01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:05.742
little come-hither squeaks,
which is difficult to do.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:11.560
There's big, furry paws
to fill in a lot of ways.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.328
Pretty clever.
I don't know where she gets it.

01:11:15.428 --> 01:11:17.032
I just don't.

01:11:17.132 --> 01:11:21.470
I was not expecting to end up being
the voice in a movie at all.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:25.106
And then John came to me about
a year and a half ago now and said,

01:11:25.206 --> 01:11:27.575
"guess what? You're gonna be Scratte."

01:11:27.675 --> 01:11:31.201
And I was just, like, "shut up."
Like, I couldn't even believe it, so...

01:11:32.513 --> 01:11:34.739
It was really exciting.

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:37.952
The final ending where you kind of,
you keep the question,

01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:40.655
"is he gonna be with the girl?
Or is he gonna get the nut?

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:44.426
"Or he's gonna get nothing?" And we had, like,
three different ways of ending the movie.

01:11:44.526 --> 01:11:47.950
And we chose one that we thought
was the best for Scrat.

01:11:48.462 --> 01:11:51.258
The nut always comes first for Scrat.

01:11:51.358 --> 01:11:55.337
Always, always, always.
He can't win at the end, never.

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:58.995
And that's the cardinal rule
'cause that's the Scrat.

01:11:59.373 --> 01:12:02.677
We kind of leave Scrat
where we pick him up in the beginning.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.680
He's always gonna have a certain
amount of struggle in his life

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.804
no matter what happens.
