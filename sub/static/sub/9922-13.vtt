WEBVTT

02:29.484 --> 02:30.819
What?

02:55.426 --> 02:57.095
What can you see?

02:59.389 --> 03:02.016
I cannot
see any of our boats.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.895
Mother was right.

03:09.274 --> 03:10.275
Almost.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.642
You see the others?

03:56.946 --> 03:58.156
What weapons do we have?

04:02.285 --> 04:04.829
So, Father,
what are we going to do?

04:06.998 --> 04:08.917
Your son asks a good question.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.169
Here we are in deep trouble.

04:11.336 --> 04:13.171
So, what are you
going to do about it?

04:13.838 --> 04:15.757
I don't know yet.

04:15.924 --> 04:18.384
Then you'd better
make up your mind.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.595
Because all
this is your fault.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.096
You made us sail here,

04:22.263 --> 04:23.890
and as far as we know, we,

04:23.973 --> 04:26.100
this little group here,
are all that are left.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.854
Where is your
army of revenge now,
Ragnar Lothbrok?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.898
I'll tell you where it is.

04:32.023 --> 04:34.359
At the bottom of the sea,
feeding the fishes.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.624
I suggest you all
warm up a little.

05:12.105 --> 05:13.356
Get out!

05:45.304 --> 05:46.597
Let's go.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.604
Forget that thing. Just crawl.

05:54.939 --> 05:57.650
With this,
I can walk like a normal man.

06:03.448 --> 06:04.699
Get off me!

06:04.782 --> 06:08.870
I'm not going to
stand around all day
watching you try to be normal,

06:08.953 --> 06:10.371
when you never will be.

06:10.455 --> 06:12.290
I am normal.

06:19.464 --> 06:21.090
No, you are not.

06:22.759 --> 06:26.387
Once you realize that,
that is when
greatness will happen.

06:30.308 --> 06:31.642
Now crawl!

07:09.013 --> 07:10.348
Frankia.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.603
Are you going to try
and contact Uncle Rollo?

08:37.435 --> 08:38.811
Papa!

08:39.145 --> 08:42.064
William! Marcellus, come!

08:42.773 --> 08:43.858
Come, children.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.870
Now, we have to
carry the cripple.

09:49.882 --> 09:52.843
This disaster,
they all blame you for it.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.637
I know.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.189
What's so funny?

10:08.025 --> 10:10.945
It's just
the great Ragnar Lothbrok

10:11.028 --> 10:13.406
acting like
a nurse to a cripple.

10:32.550 --> 10:33.759
Pagans!

10:39.724 --> 10:41.892
What now,
Prince Aethelwulf?

10:52.236 --> 10:54.238
We find Ragnar Lothbrok.

11:03.706 --> 11:06.167
You see how well
treachery pays off, Bjorn.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.002
Don't do
anything stupid, Floki.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.379
I've never done
anything stupid
in my life.

11:10.463 --> 11:11.464
But I am contemplating

11:11.547 --> 11:13.382
whether dying would be better
than dealing with this scum.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.210
I don't want to apologize.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.461
What would be the point?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.798
We are where we are.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.886
Gods have spoken.

12:03.432 --> 12:06.977
This is my wife,
Princess Gisla.

12:07.812 --> 12:12.691
And our children,
William, Marcellus.

12:14.485 --> 12:15.653
Celsa.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.585
My wife wants to know
why you are here.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.297
So do I.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.896
I want to go here.

12:53.691 --> 12:55.067
To this sea.

12:57.695 --> 13:01.031
But I have to sail
along your coastline
to get there.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.535
I need safe
passage for my fleet.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.537
In return for what?

13:06.787 --> 13:09.748
In return for not attacking
your villages and towns,

13:09.832 --> 13:11.208
like we should do.

13:15.713 --> 13:17.006
May I take this?
No.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.982
How long do you think

13:35.065 --> 13:36.400
you can keep us prisoners,
traitor?

13:36.692 --> 13:40.446
We have 60 ships
outside your ports
full of Vikings!

13:40.529 --> 13:44.491
Don't you think they will come
knocking soon if
we don't return?

13:49.288 --> 13:53.125
If we stick to the coast,
we can find
the fishing village.

13:53.209 --> 13:56.378
We can make camp
and steal a boat
in the morning.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.507
That is what you
want to do, isn't it?
What else is there for us?

14:00.591 --> 14:02.843
It's the only thing
we can do.

15:55.122 --> 16:00.044
Those soldiers
will have discovered
the wreckage by now.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.254
They'll be looking for us.

16:03.756 --> 16:05.632
And if they find us,

16:05.716 --> 16:08.052
we look like part
of a raiding party.

16:10.054 --> 16:12.556
A small threat,
but still a threat.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.267
I have no doubt
what they'll do to us.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.190
You think it's possible
we might be able
to steal a boat?

16:23.567 --> 16:25.819
I didn't come here to go back.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.214
That is why we
can no longer travel
with our friends.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.344
What are you talking about?

16:50.427 --> 16:51.637
It can only be you.

16:53.097 --> 16:54.264
And me.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.600
You and me?

16:57.893 --> 17:01.271
You mean,
an old man and a cripple?

17:02.773 --> 17:03.941
Yes.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.246
I am taking Kattegat back.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.249
Aslaug isn't fit
to be Queen.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.919
What about Ragnar's sons?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.296
Born of a witch.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.006
They are still his sons.

18:15.012 --> 18:18.015
Bjorn, Hvitserk,
and Ivar are all gone.

18:19.308 --> 18:22.769
But Ubbe and Sigurd remain.
Are you going to
kill them, too?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.234
Torvi!

18:38.619 --> 18:39.745
Who is this?

18:39.828 --> 18:42.372
A slave girl. Margrethe.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.333
And why have you brought her?

18:44.416 --> 18:46.710
She was being used
by the sons of Ragnar.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.086
All of them?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.343
Did you hate all of the sons?

18:57.179 --> 18:58.305
No.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.183
But I thought
Ivar would kill me.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.768
But Ivar has gone.

19:02.851 --> 19:06.063
Enough questions.
I have to talk to Torvi.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.662
How is Guthrum?
How is your son?

19:21.745 --> 19:23.538
He is happy and well.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.710
You must return to Kattegat
before your
absence is noticed.

19:28.794 --> 19:33.757
But, when you return,
there is something else
I need you to do.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.128
What do you want, cripple?

20:38.905 --> 20:42.492
Ivar! Ivar!
You don't have to kill me!

20:43.744 --> 20:47.664
Because you can have this.

21:33.835 --> 21:37.047
This is an interesting place
you've brought us to.

21:37.631 --> 21:39.758
I hope it's not
the last place on earth
I see.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.471
Why aren't you talking?

21:44.971 --> 21:48.517
Could it be because you know
you've made a bad judgment?

21:49.393 --> 21:53.939
We totally believed in you,
and thought the gods did also.

21:54.022 --> 21:58.318
Still, you must have a plan
for getting us
out of this mess.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.154
And I'm sure we'd all like
to hear what it is.

22:03.782 --> 22:06.910
How could you ever think
you can do
business with Rollo?

22:07.077 --> 22:08.995
He's killed
hundreds of our people!

22:09.079 --> 22:12.165
He's lied and cheated,
double-crossed
his own brother,

22:12.249 --> 22:15.502
renounced the gods,
committed every
crime known to man.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.130
We should have
attacked his fleet!

22:18.213 --> 22:22.259
At least we could have
fought and died like Vikings,
instead of sheep.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.628
Do not
disappoint us, Ironside.

23:09.014 --> 23:13.393
So, Ragnar has returned.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.562
He came with a fleet,

23:15.645 --> 23:17.439
but his ships were
broken up in a storm.

23:17.731 --> 23:20.483
It seems unlikely
many of them survived.

23:20.609 --> 23:24.029
But some survivors were found
slaughtered near
the village of Wareham.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.280
Who killed them?

23:25.363 --> 23:28.158
I don't know. But we didn't.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.411
And there is
no sign of Ragnar?

23:33.330 --> 23:34.372
No.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.459
You will keep searching.

23:37.542 --> 23:40.670
In the meantime,
I must leave for
council in Repton.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.756
I cannot ignore
my duties just because

23:42.839 --> 23:45.383
one man has illegally
entered my kingdom.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.676
He is not just one man!

23:47.677 --> 23:50.180
He is the history
of his race, Father.

23:50.347 --> 23:54.267
He's the face of the enemy
we must always fight,
always overcome.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.769
And if we are
the Lambs of God, then he...

23:58.355 --> 24:00.273
He is the eternal wolf.

24:00.774 --> 24:03.276
Sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.986
You didn't.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.617
What's this?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.078
It's the raven banner
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.038
We think he's
returned to haunt us.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.289
Will he come here?

24:16.373 --> 24:17.624
Who knows?

24:17.707 --> 24:21.127
But as long as
he does not arrive
at the head of 3,000 warriors,

24:21.211 --> 24:22.504
I refuse to be alarmed.

24:22.587 --> 24:29.135
Whatever my son says,
he is, after all, just a man.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.639
How do we know
that we're going

24:32.722 --> 24:34.849
in the right direction,
Father?

24:35.225 --> 24:37.060
All roads lead to the throne.

24:37.143 --> 24:40.563
Sounds good,
but it's probably wrong.

25:28.653 --> 25:33.783
I bet you wish
you'd never brought me along.
Right?

25:36.036 --> 25:38.788
And I bet you wish
you would have
killed me when I was born,

25:38.872 --> 25:41.082
just like you wanted to.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.794
Only when you talk.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.136
I thought your legs
were a weakness

25:54.721 --> 25:56.806
and you wouldn't survive.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.977
I was wrong.

26:02.979 --> 26:05.065
Your legs have
given you a strength,

26:05.148 --> 26:07.442
a strength that
even your brothers don't have.

26:09.652 --> 26:15.367
You are like a deaf man
whose eyesight is sharper
than anyone else's.

26:18.328 --> 26:19.913
You are special.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.582
Not in spite of your legs,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.794
but because of them.

26:32.634 --> 26:37.514
I think that's
the first time you've ever
admitted to being wrong.

26:41.184 --> 26:44.646
It'll never happen again,
so enjoy it.

26:53.154 --> 26:57.283
Bjorn, let me present to you

26:57.367 --> 27:01.037
Johannes Scotus Erivgena,
a librarian.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.665
I sent for him from Paris.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.209
Hence the delay.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.502
Come.

27:09.212 --> 27:12.173
I want Scotus to
explain this map to you.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.974
What you see on the table
in front of you

27:21.057 --> 27:23.393
is the Strabo map
of the entire road network

27:23.476 --> 27:26.146
of the Roman Empire
at its zenith.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.776
Of which your own map

27:31.860 --> 27:34.320
is but a mere fragment.

27:40.535 --> 27:41.870
You can
see that the Empire

27:41.953 --> 27:44.831
was all built around
the Mediterranean Sea.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.046
It started here in Rome,

27:52.130 --> 27:54.924
then it annexed
all of these
Greek territories,

27:55.383 --> 27:57.552
and then went here,

27:58.511 --> 28:00.972
into what is now
known as Saracen Spain.

28:04.559 --> 28:07.687
Which is to say,
a Muslim caliphate.

28:10.398 --> 28:14.402
So, to reach the enclosed sea?

28:14.486 --> 28:16.613
You will have to navigate
some dangerous waters,

28:18.114 --> 28:20.909
and into the Bay
of Biscay, here,

28:21.034 --> 28:25.121
which is also notorious
for its storms and
its violent seas.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.083
But first,
we must sail along
the Frankish coast.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.381
Is there any other route?

28:38.134 --> 28:39.302
Can you...

28:44.641 --> 28:46.267
No other route.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.896
Will you give us safe passage
along the Frankish coast

28:49.979 --> 28:52.023
so we may sail unmolested?

28:55.652 --> 28:56.986
No.

29:01.074 --> 29:04.202
Only if you allow me
to come with you.

29:15.713 --> 29:17.173
Come on, donkey.

29:24.013 --> 29:26.891
What if we're walking
in the wrong direction, hmm?

29:27.267 --> 29:30.687
Then we'll turn around
and walk the other way.

29:35.858 --> 29:37.694
What is it about you?

29:39.237 --> 29:40.363
What?

29:40.697 --> 29:44.200
Well,
you do not seem to accept
the verdict of the gods.

29:45.702 --> 29:48.204
What is their verdict?
You tell me!

29:48.705 --> 29:51.874
If you want to know
if the gods still favor you,

29:51.958 --> 29:54.794
then look around.
Look at us.

29:57.088 --> 29:59.257
You give the gods
too much credit.

29:59.340 --> 30:03.469
Oh, so, then you
disagree with all of us?
With the Seer? With everyone?

30:04.304 --> 30:05.763
What if I do?

30:07.056 --> 30:08.224
Huh?

30:11.644 --> 30:16.232
Well, I guess that is
why you are who you are.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.445
I never thought
of that before.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.990
You were just
my famous father.

30:24.073 --> 30:26.701
I thought you
must have got lucky
because the gods chose you.

30:26.784 --> 30:31.205
But, maybe that is not true.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.755
But you are not Viking.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.215
You renounced your heritage!

30:42.091 --> 30:46.638
You embraced our
world and our God,
and I have had your children.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.765
And they are not Viking.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.185
And if I thought
they were Viking,

30:52.268 --> 30:54.437
I would kill them
before killing myself.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.199
Everything you say is true.

31:07.492 --> 31:11.954
But I love you
and I love my children.

31:12.622 --> 31:15.875
But I cannot deny
that part of myself
which is still Viking,

31:15.958 --> 31:17.627
no matter how hard I try.

31:19.837 --> 31:22.632
Then, perhaps,
you don't try hard enough.

31:27.220 --> 31:32.392
When you...
When you hear thunder,
it is only thunder.

31:33.810 --> 31:39.816
But for me,
it is still Thor
beating his hammer.

31:49.826 --> 31:52.495
If you go away,
whether you live or die,

31:52.578 --> 31:55.206
this will probably
be the end of us.

32:01.504 --> 32:04.340
Come on, brother!
Let's go.

32:14.517 --> 32:19.313
Two sons of Ragnar Lothbrok!
How privileged we are.

32:19.397 --> 32:20.898
If you say so.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.943
How many of you
are there altogether?

32:25.570 --> 32:26.904
Who can say for sure?

32:28.448 --> 32:30.116
I know of one for sure.

32:30.199 --> 32:35.037
Yes. And may
the gods be with Bjorn
and our brother Hvitserk,

32:35.121 --> 32:36.914
wherever they may be.

32:41.377 --> 32:44.380
But you are here!
And so is Margrethe.

32:45.256 --> 32:46.883
So we were told.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.926
We're not quite sure why.

32:52.430 --> 32:57.935
Margrethe has invited you here
because she loves both of you.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.105
You will have to
decide amongst yourselves.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.694
Unless, you decide
that you can share her.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.402
I am really sorry.

33:58.621 --> 34:00.957
Hey! Let us out!

34:32.154 --> 34:33.406
Oars!

34:33.489 --> 34:34.824
Ship oars!

34:35.700 --> 34:36.826
Oars!

36:31.190 --> 36:32.483
Pull him up!

37:12.732 --> 37:13.816
Row!

37:13.899 --> 37:14.984
Row!

37:15.317 --> 37:16.902
Row!

41:16.350 --> 41:17.559
Enough!

41:26.527 --> 41:28.320
These are my people.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.593
We made it.

42:53.447 --> 42:56.992
Once we get inside,
we will be separated.

42:58.368 --> 43:00.496
If you are smart,
you will not be hurt.

43:01.121 --> 43:03.248
When I can, I will find you.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.128
I know what to do.

43:08.587 --> 43:11.006
I think you brought
me here for a reason.

43:15.135 --> 43:17.346
No matter what
they do to me,

43:19.306 --> 43:21.183
you have to act
like a cripple,

43:22.351 --> 43:25.270
and then they
won't feel threatened
by you.

43:28.273 --> 43:30.859
And what are they
going to do to you?

43:40.369 --> 43:45.624
So, I'm going to
watch you being hurt?

43:46.959 --> 43:48.919
Sounds like a good plan.

44:31.420 --> 44:32.629
My Lord!

44:34.798 --> 44:36.258
Archers!
