00:48.120 --> 00:49.240
Is this your first time, babe?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.200
Oi! I'm talking to you.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.520
- What's your name?
- Bea.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.080
Bea Smith.

01:06.520 --> 01:07.920
Soak it up, Bea Smith.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.640
Good day, Chris.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.360
You know the drill, mate.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.600
You want a gobby? It'll cost you.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.080
A packet of smokes.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.480
Do you smoke?

02:18.640 --> 02:19.640
Please come forward.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.840
Home sweet home, love.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.320
Christ's sake, Sharni.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.680
Oh, shit.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.480
Date of birth?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.520
Are you on any medication?

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
No.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.640
Next of kin?

03:32.640 --> 03:33.680
Next of kin?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.880
- Debbie.
- Bea?

03:38.440 --> 03:40.440
Debbie. Debbie.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.360
I need to speak to my daughter, Debbie.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.840
Fletch! Fletch, grab her.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.000
- I just need to speak to my daughter.
- Bea, Bea, calm down.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.360
Will, what is her name? What is her name?

03:52.840 --> 03:54.760
- Will, what's her name?
- Bea Smith.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.880
I need to speak to my daughter!

03:56.960 --> 03:58.760
- We're gonna have to sedate her.
- Yeah.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.200
- Okay. Medical!
- Please! Help me!

04:03.040 --> 04:05.400
Stop it! I want to speak to Debbie!

04:05.480 --> 04:07.800
- Please!
- Go, go, go, go! Go. Go.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.200
Are you okay today?

05:28.400 --> 05:31.680
You know, a lot of women find it
overwhelming on their first night.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.480
We have a peer worker, Liz Birdsworth,
she'll introduce you to the women.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.720
When can I talk to my daughter?

05:37.960 --> 05:40.400
All numbers have to be put on
a call list. I'll organize it.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.520
You can call her after lunch.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
Thanks, Vera.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.080
It's Miss Bennett.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
Hi.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.640
Okay. This front door
gets locked every night,

05:55.720 --> 05:58.000
but feel free to move around the unit.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.800
With the other women? They're
not locked in their cells?

06:03.720 --> 06:05.840
Yeah, that's right.
That's the panic button.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.720
If there's any trouble, you press it.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.000
Now this is the lounge kitchen.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.760
There is a kettle. Coffee, tea.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.400
The sugar is rationed, but feel free to,

06:14.480 --> 06:18.160
you know, watch some TV and make
yourself a cuppa in your free time.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.040
That's your cell. The count
is in half an hour, then lunch.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.040
Work will be allocated to you on Monday.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.400
Miss Bennett? Can I please get a uniform?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.960
You can keep your own clothes
while you're on remand.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.600
I'd prefer a uniform.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.960
Okay. I'll have one sent over.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.960
- Sorry, I thought...
- Hey.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.400
It's all yours when we're done.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.520
What, you like to watch, do you?

07:08.920 --> 07:10.320
Oh, don't go now.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.040
Just getting started.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.040
Nice color.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.680
Your hair.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.240
- Do it yourself?
- Yeah.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.960
- I'm a hairdresser.
- You are?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.080
When are you open for business?

07:41.960 --> 07:44.040
I don't have any of my things.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.720
All you need is a good pair of hands.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.320
Yeah.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
- What's your name, Red?
- Bea.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.480
Bea?

07:56.800 --> 07:57.960
That's brutal.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.760
I'm Franky.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.880
Nice to meet you. Kim, Red.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.280
- Red, Kim.
- Hello, again.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.440
Got a new roomie, girls. Why
don't you give her the heads up.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.920
- Hey! Yeah!
- Hey!

08:12.000 --> 08:14.480
Look. Sorry I wasn't here,
love. They should have told me.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.200
This is Doreen and this is Kaiya.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
- Say hello.
- Hi.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.080
And I'm Liz. I'm the peer worker.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.760
And I'm here to show you the ropes

08:21.840 --> 08:23.720
and make sure you don't
get into any trouble.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.000
Are you okay?

08:26.880 --> 08:28.560
Can I go in my room now?

08:30.800 --> 08:33.919
It is a bit stark, but
you'll make it your own.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.159
What'd they pinch you for?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.559
Mum! Mum! Mum! Let go of my mum!

08:43.640 --> 08:46.000
Mum!

08:46.920 --> 08:48.200
Who is that?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.200
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.880
Her name is Debbie.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.680
- Oh, lovely.
- Aw! You know, she can visit.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.040
No. Prison is no place for kids.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.760
What?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.160
Oh, no, I didn't mean...

09:02.240 --> 09:04.400
- Stuck-up bitch!
- Hey, Doreen.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.720
- I wasn't judging her.
- No, no, no.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.520
Don't take it personally.
She's just given up her ciggies,

09:08.600 --> 09:10.280
and it's like walking on eggshells.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.360
Attention, compound. Count
will commence in 10 minutes.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.480
You've gotta be standing in your
door in 10 minutes for the head count.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.560
And I'd leave it open or the girls get
shitty. They think you don't trust them.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.680
Okay.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.120
And don't borrow anyone
else's stuff without asking.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.880
But if Franky wants any
of yours, don't argue.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.360
Oh, you know the panic
button by the front door?

09:32.440 --> 09:33.560
Yeah.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.320
Don't ever press it.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.600
- Franky!
- Sorry, Mr. Jackson.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.160
- You settling in all right?
- Yeah.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.800
We've put your daughter on the call list.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.320
You can join the phone queues
after lunch. Liz will show you.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.520
Thank you.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.480
Hey, Red!

10:49.200 --> 10:50.880
We had a game of basketball last week.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.840
You should have seen Mr.
Jackson in his shorts!

10:55.680 --> 10:56.720
We lost that game.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.160
Only 'cause you guys were
staring at his ass the whole time.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.120
- Exactly.
- He's got a great ass.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.880
Liz seems to have taken Bea in hand.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.920
She was really distressed.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.560
I think she'll settle in okay
once she's talked to her daughter.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.960
Vera, I think you should stop
making friends with the prisoners.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.640
Start focusing on what's really going on.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.960
- Call the staff into my office.
- Yes, Governor.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.160
Mrs. Jackson!

11:23.800 --> 11:27.200
You hungry, are you? You want
to share these? Are you good?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.680
Hey, your old roommate,
Sharni, she's back inside.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.040
- Oh, is she?
- Yeah.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.160
Must have missed the food, eh?

11:32.240 --> 11:34.800
Yeah. It's what we're famous for, eh?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.160
Um. The poor old thing, she
pissed herself in processing and

11:38.960 --> 11:40.520
you wouldn't believe what slipped out.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.880
That was a lot of gear.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.280
You don't know anything
about that, do you, Franky?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.560
Why would I?

11:51.800 --> 11:53.280
Ah, well.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.240
Eat it while it's hot.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.640
Hey.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.760
- My room. After lunch.
- Sorry?

12:11.240 --> 12:12.440
Dessert.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.400
Let's put Sharni in the
slot for a couple of weeks,

12:15.480 --> 12:17.200
see what she's got to tell us.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.920
And then when she's out,
we'll put her into D-block.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.880
They'll find another way
to bring the drugs in.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.640
Hasn't changed since Holt was slotted.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.360
Yeah, that's because Doyle
has taken up the slack.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.320
But now she's bringing in crystal
meth, which fucks everyone.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.600
You try being on the ward when
they're off their face on that shit.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.280
So we are gonna come down on her.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.960
I've been working closely
with Franky and she's clean.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.360
Are you sure she's behind this?

12:37.440 --> 12:40.560
Erica, do you think someone who is pinned
half the day could run this operation?

12:40.640 --> 12:44.160
We don't need Sharni's confession
to know Franky Doyle is behind this.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.880
- What do you want us to do?
- I want you to ride her.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.840
Box visits. Spot checks.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.560
Restricted privileges. We're
gonna put her out of business.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.800
Ride her hard and she's
gonna rise to the challenge.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.120
Isn't it smarter to negotiate?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.320
We don't negotiate with prisoners.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.560
Okay. Thanks, everyone.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.480
Just a sec.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.520
That Erica, she really pisses me off.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.040
I mean, she's not even an officer.
She shouldn't be in these meetings.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.160
Come here. You can't argue
with the department. Okay?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.680
You have got to relax.
Remember what the doc said?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.840
Oh, honey, let's not talk
about this now, please.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.040
We can talk about it tonight.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.480
In bed. Making love.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
Making babies.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.200
Oh, I'll come back.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.440
- No. It's okay. Will was just leaving.
- Okay.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.120
- Still on for the game tomorrow?
- Yeah.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.200
What can I do for you?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.840
OIIS report. And there are
two more remands coming in.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.560
- Uh-huh? Are they the files?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.760
Maybe we can send some down to C-block.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.720
Was there anything else?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.800
It's pretty inappropriate
behavior for the Governor.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.520
Well, if you had knocked, Mr. Fletcher...

13:59.600 --> 14:02.240
... you would have saved
yourself the embarrassment.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.520
Thanks.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.080
How long do we get?

14:10.160 --> 14:12.400
Oh, 12 minutes, and
then the phone cuts out.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.640
If no one answers, you gotta
go to the end of the queue.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.120
I've been waiting for you.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.960
I hate fucking waiting.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.280
Ease up, Franky. She's a
newbie. And she's into blokes.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.200
I don't care who she fucks.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.640
Kim is looking for you.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.000
- I'm minding a spot for Doreen.
- You were.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.080
- Now off you go.
- See you in a bit?

14:35.360 --> 14:38.680
A visitor's form. I've filled
it out. You just need to sign it.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.920
What for?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.600
Tomorrow, you meet your friend Craig.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.320
- Collect your house-warming present.
- What present?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.040
Well, it's not a fucking cake.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.440
- I'd love to be any help, but I don't...
- Hey, hey, hey.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.760
- Want to talk to your daughter? Do you?
- Yeah. But, please...

14:52.840 --> 14:55.280
Hey, Booms! Got anyone waiting?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.440
What for?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.960
Well, Red is in no hurry. Bring 'em in.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.560
Oh.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.800
Look, Red,

15:02.880 --> 15:05.080
I'm all about fun, the girls know that.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.720
It's how things work in my unit.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.960
They also know that if they
want to survive in here,

15:10.040 --> 15:13.800
if they want to eat, sleep,
or speak to their kids,

15:14.240 --> 15:15.480
they'll do what I say.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.720
You don't want to be the
odd one out, do you? Eh?

15:19.760 --> 15:20.960
Do you, Red?

15:21.320 --> 15:22.560
Back it up.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.760
Here we go. In you go.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.360
Dors.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.680
- I'm in before you.
- In you go, bub.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.680
- Bea Smith?
- Yeah.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.840
I need you to come with me.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.560
I honestly didn't mean to offend you.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.800
Whatever Franky wants, just do it.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.040
- I can't.
- Franky is top dog.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.080
- Ever since Jacs left.
- Who is Jacs?

16:30.360 --> 16:31.520
Vinnie Holt's wife.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.080
She's in the slot right
now, but she'll be back.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.280
I just want to phone my daughter.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.840
- It sucks when you can't see them.
- Yeah.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.400
I miss Kaiya when she goes
out to visit her grandma.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.120
So you understand.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.640
It's the way that I left her.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.600
I just want to know my little girl is okay.

16:56.440 --> 17:00.600
And this thing that
Franky wants me to do, I...

17:01.480 --> 17:03.520
I don't know how...

17:03.600 --> 17:06.800
You gotta choose sides in here.
Franky will look out for you.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.599
Well, she's famous.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.440
- Did you see her on the telly?
- Yeah.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.680
I actually felt sorry for her.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.440
Don't ever tell her that.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.119
Look, if you want to
speak to your daughter,

17:23.040 --> 17:24.200
sign the form.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.640
Are you ready to win?

18:01.720 --> 18:04.320
Are you ready for fabulous prizes?

18:04.640 --> 18:07.480
Attention compound. Attention compound.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.200
Visiting hours will commence in 10 minutes.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.400
You're on.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.800
Who are you seeing today?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.480
Just a friend.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.600
- Hi. I'm Bea.
- What?

19:31.800 --> 19:33.040
Forget about it.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.800
Hey.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.680
Can you just have a look at this, please?

19:44.680 --> 19:47.720
You stupid fucking
bitch. Sit the fuck down.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.320
In 20 minutes, I'm going to be
leaving and we're gonna try that again.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.600
This time, you're not
gonna fuck it up. Right?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.480
Time's up.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.840
Try to look like you're
enjoying it, this time, eh?

21:00.240 --> 21:01.760
See you around, babe.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.120
I didn't think you were the
kind to have a bit on the side.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.280
How was your first night in H-block?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.120
Good.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.960
Any trouble from Franky?

21:52.560 --> 21:55.320
You know, the women do find
these strips searches get easier.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.760
Hair.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.640
Okay. Mouth.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.360
Wider.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.200
Okay. Lift your tongue.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.280
Okay. Ears, please?

22:33.640 --> 22:36.080
Has Liz mentioned our programs to you?

22:39.040 --> 22:42.560
You should talk to her about it. Some
women find it helps to pass the time.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.400
Miss Davidson, I was just
telling Bea about your program.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.760
Oh, great. Bea, we'll see if we can
keep you occupied until your hearing.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.440
- Miss Davidson.
- Franky.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.440
Now those have been wasted on a uniform!

22:55.520 --> 22:57.840
Oh, yeah. It's one of the perks of my job.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.400
So, let's set up a meeting.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.720
You can go now.

23:03.320 --> 23:07.120
- Vera! Has the prisoner been searched?
- Of course, Governor.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.800
Good day. Do you want to open
your mouth up for me, please?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.880
Open and stretch it wide.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.280
That's it. Stretch 'em out.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.320
Go wider. Thank you.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
Tongue that way, and that way.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.920
- It's all right.
- Lift your head back.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.360
That's it. Open wide.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.560
Go down. Lift your tongue up.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.520
Okay. Just look at me.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.360
Give us a cough.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.880
See me in my office.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.160
- Did you get it or not?
- Yeah.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.800
Ah, shit.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.800
- What did I swallow?
- Come on. Let's go.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.360
Come on. Boomer, piss off.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.280
I'm still going.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.920
Fingers down.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.280
Put your fingers down. Go.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.120
- Ah, gee, do you have to?
- Shut the fuck up!

23:59.720 --> 24:01.240
Put your fingers in there. Come on.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.160
- I'm trying.
- Come on!

24:03.240 --> 24:05.480
If that thing bursts, you're
dead. So throw the fuck up.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.680
Good.

24:08.760 --> 24:09.960
Ugh!

24:11.360 --> 24:12.760
Fucking pick it up.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.560
Hey, do you want to hand that over? Thanks.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.440
Vera?

24:21.320 --> 24:22.640
You want to pass it over?

24:30.200 --> 24:31.560
Stand up for us, Bea.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.120
Hands out in front.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.440
Anything to say?

24:41.720 --> 24:43.880
Yeah. Can I have some bloody privacy?

24:46.040 --> 24:48.200
Mary, do you want to call for the cleaner?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.800
There's nothing in your file
that indicates you're a user.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.960
So we're assuming you're
trafficking for Franky Doyle.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.960
You say Doyle's name and
I'll put you into protection.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.120
There will be no reprisals from the women.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.080
If you say nothing, this is
going to go on your record.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.520
And it's not going to
look good at your hearing.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.360
- Oh, could you just say something?
- I don't know anything about it.

25:18.440 --> 25:22.520
I was watching your visit on the
CCTV. You did not know that man.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.880
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.400
You know what? Put her in
the slot. See how she goes.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.520
Vera?

25:37.400 --> 25:39.160
You've been my deputy now for, um...

25:39.760 --> 25:40.920
- Two years.
- Yeah.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.480
Before me, it was Dalton that
was Governor, yeah, for...

25:44.240 --> 25:46.400
- One year.
- And before that it was Peters?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.080
He lasted 18 months.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.960
Right. And all that time, you were deputy.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.480
You've watched a parade of
Governors come through that door.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.600
It must have been very, very
difficult for you when I got this job.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.000
- Of course not.
- Then why are you making me look bad?

26:00.280 --> 26:01.840
That is not what I'm doing.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.880
So you're just not up to the
job? Is that what I'm hearing?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.960
Because we have to think about that.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.160
Could you get on to the dog squad?

26:12.480 --> 26:14.440
I'm gonna order a ramp at the prison.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.920
Yes, Governor.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.440
Down.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.640
Down, boy.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.880
Right. Sit.

26:25.720 --> 26:29.160
Okay. The plan tonight is
to hit H-2 and hit it hard.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.960
Let's do it.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.320
Go. Go, boy.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.360
Attention compound. Attention compound.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.840
This is a code blue.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.960
♪ He used to give me roses ♪

27:07.200 --> 27:09.080
♪ I wish he would again ♪

27:13.280 --> 27:16.320

27:20.200 --> 27:22.320

27:42.760 --> 27:45.200

27:53.080 --> 27:54.760
♪ Da, dum ♪

27:59.280 --> 28:00.520
Lovely.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.400
Morning.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.880
Here's your breakfast.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.600
It's included in the price.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.160
- Tough night?
- Yeah.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.840
Have you tried sleeping on this?

28:37.040 --> 28:38.200
You want a ciggie?

28:38.880 --> 28:41.200
- Outside?
- Well, you can't smoke in here.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.120
So, how long will I be in here?

29:00.440 --> 29:01.880
It's up to the Governor.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.960
Is this the good-cop routine?

29:08.560 --> 29:09.600
I'm not a cop.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.080
Look, between me and you,
you're doing the right thing.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.560
They'll keep grilling you.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.080
But that's nothing to what the
women will do to you if you talk.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.960
The Governor said that I'd
be safe, I'd be in protection.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.680
If they want to get to someone, they
do it, even if it's just in here.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.880
- Not a smoker, are you?
- I only came out for the fresh air.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.320
They went way too far. They
took our extra blankets.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.040
They took our clothes. They
even took Kaiya's teddy bear.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.600
Well, the dogs must have picked up a scent.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.200
Oh, come on, Mrs. Jackson. Throw me a bone!

29:53.280 --> 29:55.920
- I am trying to help you out.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
Oh, look, I managed to set up that
meeting with Mr. Channing for next week.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.560
That's your parole.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.760
Now, you've done a
great job as peer worker.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
And I'm going to make sure
they take that into account.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.240
I didn't come here for brownie points.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.680
I'm looking after the girls.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.840
Yeah. Well, so am I.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.840
Until I get some information
on Franky's trafficking,

30:14.920 --> 30:16.680
all privileges are suspended.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.880
Unless you can help me out with that?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.320
No. I thought not.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.840
I'll let you know how that meeting
goes, but I'd keep my fingers crossed.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.640
Ah, bring her in, Mr. Jackson.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.160
Take a seat.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.480
So, how did you go last night?

30:39.480 --> 30:40.560
Jog your memory?

30:45.560 --> 30:46.640
Look, the dog squad,

30:46.720 --> 30:48.840
they raided the prison
last night, because of you.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.960
And the women are not happy.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.320
If I send you back to that compound,

30:53.400 --> 30:55.880
you're gonna have to deal
with the repercussions.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.880
And women like you, you're...

30:59.600 --> 31:00.800
You're a soft target.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.600
But if you tell me who
you're trafficking for,

31:05.680 --> 31:07.160
you won't see that compound again.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.320
I'll put you in your own cell,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.960
under protection for the
rest of your stay here.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.160
I prefer the company.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.000
You be careful what you wish for.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.080
That was nicely played, Red.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.200
- Good on you, Bea.
- Yeah, good work.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.080
You did the right thing.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.480
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.680
The women are quiet this morning.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.680
- What, even Franky?
- You know what that means.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.120
- Hey, morning.
- Morning, Governor.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.960
Matthew, would you return Holt

31:53.920 --> 31:55.600
to the compound after the count?

31:57.680 --> 31:59.400
Holt is not due back for weeks.

31:59.480 --> 32:03.760
Mmm-hmm. I'm just
rewarding her good behavior.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.320
- Divide and conquer?
- Better the devil...

32:08.480 --> 32:10.400
Oh, those good old heroin days.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.160
Nice to be back in your own cell, Jacs?

32:43.200 --> 32:44.360
Jackie!

32:45.040 --> 32:46.640
Yes! Look who is back.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.400
Welcome back, Jacs!

32:48.480 --> 32:49.880
Good to see you, Jacs. Been a while.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.120
That bitch is playing with me.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.640
- There you go, love.
- Thanks.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.200
You must be Smith.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.320
Yeah.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.040
I'm Jackie Holt. You can call me Jacs.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.880
I heard you caused some
trouble for the screws.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.120
Good on you, love.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.000
Come and sit with me. We can have a natter.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.600
I think I've got to sit
with the women from my unit.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.160
It's a free country.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.360
But I won't take no for an answer.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.880
I'll do you a deal. We'll
take this, you get me a cuppa.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.960
Francesca won't mind, will you?

33:34.040 --> 33:35.840
I heard you let down some of the women.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.600
You know how they get when you
make promises you can't deliver.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.640
Never mind. I'm back.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.600
You look older.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.520
Experience always wins,
Francesca, in the end.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.640
Yeah.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.040
Oh, sorry, love, I didn't say.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.640
I don't take milk.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.800
You made a big mistake framing me.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.040
You lost your temper. Again.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.120
It gets you into all sorts
of trouble, Francesca.

34:06.720 --> 34:07.880
Ooh-aah.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.719
The tide is out, love.

34:13.639 --> 34:14.719
Sorry?

34:15.040 --> 34:17.040
A bit more water?

34:19.400 --> 34:20.960
- She doesn't...
- And on it goes.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.920
Too full.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.560
Oi! Get here.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.040
I'm not a dog, Harry.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.159
I wanted coffee.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.600
I'll do it.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.040
Oi, Birdsworth. Smith is making it.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.040
It's okay. I'll do it.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.360
Mug's dirty.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.840
Well, go on, move your arse.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Now, move your fucking arse!

35:45.680 --> 35:46.760
Harry!

35:47.200 --> 35:49.000
Uh! Uh. Oh...

36:05.880 --> 36:07.360
What are you waiting for?

36:09.120 --> 36:10.200
No.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.160
I beg your pardon?

36:13.760 --> 36:14.960
I'm not doing it.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.680
Oh, we got a feisty one here, girls.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.440
What are you in for, love? Parking fines?

36:28.960 --> 36:30.800
Offence to administer substances.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.280
Causing serious injury.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.720
Conduct endangering life.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.880
Grievous bodily harm.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.160
And attempted murder.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.320
So, please, make your own tea.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.600
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Yeah!

36:53.400 --> 36:55.520
Shut down by the new girl. That's nice.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.240
I've had a long time to
think about our reunion.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.880
Been looking forward to it.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.480
- Your time is over, clitty-licker.
- Oof.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.240
We're coming to get you.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.400
- Mum? Mum, are you in there?
- Deb?

37:28.320 --> 37:30.080
You just stay out there, Deb.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.440
- Mum, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.880
Mum! Let me in.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.880
Listen, Deb, just go back
inside. I'll be in in a minute.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.680
- What has he done?
- Nothing, Deb.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.960
Sweetie. Just please go back inside.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.920
Call an ambulance!

38:20.080 --> 38:21.560
- Call an ambulance!
- I am!

38:22.320 --> 38:23.320
Ambulance.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.040
Please hurry, it's my dad!

38:27.800 --> 38:29.960
I think he's tried to kill himself.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.200
We need to phone this in.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.760
Mum! Mum! Let go of my mum!

38:54.840 --> 38:56.360
Keep your hands off her!

38:56.440 --> 38:58.800
Go back inside. I'll be back, I promise.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.280
Mum!

39:00.720 --> 39:02.200
Mum!

39:06.280 --> 39:07.440
Bea?

39:09.840 --> 39:11.200
Doreen found it.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.000
She fixed it up. We wanted
it to be a bit of a surprise.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.120
Are you all right, love?

39:28.960 --> 39:30.160
Are you?

39:31.720 --> 39:32.880
It's all right.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.160
It's all right, love. Eh?

39:37.720 --> 39:38.960
It's all right.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.440
It's on. Come on.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.520
Oi.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.840
It's on. All right?

40:04.360 --> 40:06.480
That's pretty serious charges.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.880
Who was it?

40:08.680 --> 40:10.000
I didn't do anything.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.440
My husband, he tried to kill himself.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.920
- Hi, Deb.
- Hey.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.120
The cops said a statement
from me was all they needed.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.200
It was tempting.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.920
- But you kept your promise?
- I told them they were well off the mark.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.280
I said I was stressed at
work, it was getting me down,

40:49.360 --> 40:50.840
so I tried to top myself.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.640
I said exactly what you girls told them.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.360
So, that's it?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.280
Well, unless they can
make a case without me.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.880
How often did he lay into you?

41:11.480 --> 41:13.200
He didn't lay a hand on me.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.320
Thanks for doing this, Harry.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.480
Do you know how humiliating it was telling
a bunch of coppers what a loser I am?

41:27.800 --> 41:28.880
If you get done for this,

41:28.960 --> 41:30.680
it's 'cause you're too
dumb to do anything right.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.280
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. Yes.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.680
- Now you make sure you stick to the story.
- Yes.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.240
You shouldn't have stood
up to Jacs like that.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.480
What is she going to do?

41:49.560 --> 41:52.520
I don't know. At the moment,
she's got Franky to worry about.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.560
When Franky is on the warpath,
everything else goes out the window.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.240
Liz! Boomer has got a crew waiting outside.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.680
Shit, Kaiya is out there.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.200
Where is Franky?

42:16.560 --> 42:17.720
Franky?

42:18.480 --> 42:20.640
- You don't need to do this.
- She started it.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.520
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.160
Ready?

42:31.600 --> 42:34.000
Franky is gonna do Jacs. Look after Kaiya.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.240
- What are you going to do?
- Whatever Franky wants.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.040
- Women are going to get hurt.
- Only if they're with Jacs.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.240
Let's just go inside and
let everyone calm down.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.480
I am calm.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.440
Stop! Break it up!

43:29.520 --> 43:32.200
- Against the fence! Break it up!
- Move to the wall!

43:32.280 --> 43:34.400
Stop! I said move to the wall!

43:38.000 --> 43:40.920
Move to the wall! Stop! Break it up!

43:42.320 --> 43:44.160
- Go through, ladies!
- Move to the wall!

43:45.160 --> 43:46.320
I said, move to the wall!

43:51.880 --> 43:54.000
Attention compound. Attention compound.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.120
All prisoners, return to your cells.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.880
- Can I have my teddy?
- Your teddy?

44:00.720 --> 44:01.840
Is your teddy in your room?

44:02.280 --> 44:03.360
I don't know.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.240
I'll go and have a look, shall I?

44:28.920 --> 44:30.040
Your time is up then, huh?

44:33.080 --> 44:36.320
Fuck off me! What is this, huh? Three up?

44:38.960 --> 44:40.280
It's not in there, honey.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.160
Kaiya? Kaiya?

44:46.840 --> 44:48.480
Kaiya? Kaiya?

44:51.160 --> 44:53.240
Kaiya!

44:58.400 --> 44:59.760
Hold her still.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.000
Girls like you come in with
your swagger and your youth.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.320
But, underneath, you're
just a scared little girl.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.880
Once I've stripped you of your tits,
I'll show you the real Franky Doyle.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.880
Kaiya!

45:29.920 --> 45:31.120
Kaiya!

45:43.080 --> 45:45.080
Get the fuck off her!

45:50.440 --> 45:52.880
Screws are coming. Screws are coming!

45:59.960 --> 46:01.000
Kaiya?

46:04.440 --> 46:05.680
Wait, Kaiya!

46:10.480 --> 46:11.640
Kaiya!

46:41.920 --> 46:43.640
Oh. Oh!

47:10.120 --> 47:11.400
Meg?

47:13.240 --> 47:14.400
Meg?

47:16.720 --> 47:18.640
Someone call an ambulance!

47:19.160 --> 47:22.080
No! Oh, God.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.280
05 to 01, we need an ambulance.
