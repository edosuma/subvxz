00:42.633 --> 00:46.367
So, this is the car that
robbery/homicide's been looking for.

00:46.492 --> 00:48.119
Parking enforcement called it in.

00:48.244 --> 00:51.522
They were ticketing it for street
cleaning when it came back flagged.

00:51.647 --> 00:53.351
Phil Adams, age 38.

00:53.476 --> 00:56.814
He's the former manager
of Los Angeles diamond broker.

00:58.318 --> 01:01.851
Well, there are the keys,
but where is the body?

01:02.637 --> 01:04.181
You ready for this?

01:07.435 --> 01:09.735
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.122
How did he get in there?

01:12.247 --> 01:14.407
Forget that. How are we
gonna get him out?

01:14.715 --> 01:17.761
It says here that Adams... he supposed
to weigh over 300 pounds.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.936
So this is definitely the guy.

01:20.173 --> 01:21.614
What guy?

01:21.739 --> 01:24.100
He stole about $3 million
worth of diamonds

01:24.225 --> 01:26.700
from the safe in the jewelry
store he managed,

01:26.825 --> 01:28.569
all of it caught on film.

01:28.694 --> 01:30.464
Yeah, with a big, wide lens.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.859
There's video all over the news.
How do you not know this?

01:33.984 --> 01:35.344
<i>Que cabrónes son ustedes.</i>

01:36.795 --> 01:38.244
Is he all right?

01:39.693 --> 01:41.469
Excuse me. Lieutenant...

01:41.948 --> 01:44.103
detective Sanchez is supposed
to be on light duty.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.117
Did you clear him{/being here with the chief}?

01:46.242 --> 01:48.342
"Light duty" is loosely defined.

01:48.577 --> 01:51.141
The chief's taking a personal day,
I'm the ranking officer,

01:51.266 --> 01:53.445
and I say he's just fine...

01:54.850 --> 01:55.850
Sergeant.

01:58.730 --> 02:02.178
The body is bloated, decomposing,
and highly unstable.

02:02.303 --> 02:04.886
We should tow him back to the morgue
and cut the car around him.

02:05.011 --> 02:07.692
- Otherwise, he might...
- pop like a zit?

02:08.091 --> 02:10.933
What? Now all of a sudden,
you guys have gotten all sensitive?

02:11.058 --> 02:12.005
Come on.

02:23.802 --> 02:25.223
Hey, hey, wait!

02:25.551 --> 02:27.563
- Who you calling?!
- The chief.

02:28.011 --> 02:31.179
- Sanchez is not here.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

02:35.010 --> 02:36.060
Hey, chief.

02:36.427 --> 02:39.989
Yeah, we just found
a big, big round peg

02:40.114 --> 02:41.990
in a small square hole.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.863
- What are you talking about Lieutenant?
- Phil Adams.

02:44.988 --> 02:48.626
He's dead and as big as he looks
on the news, he's even bigger in person.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.295
Phil Adams?
Did you recover the diamonds?

02:51.579 --> 02:53.862
So much for the personal day.

02:55.187 --> 02:56.637
Hang on, would you?

02:57.606 --> 03:00.513
I'm not going anywhere, Ma.
I just need to keep informed.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.056
- Go on, Lieutenant.
- Okay, well, look,

03:04.181 --> 03:06.445
there were no diamonds in the car,
as far as we know,

03:06.570 --> 03:08.719
but we haven't been able
to search it properly.

03:08.844 --> 03:11.439
- Why not?
- Mr. Adams is in the trunk,

03:11.609 --> 03:13.029
and he has been for days.

03:13.154 --> 03:15.434
So we'd have to pull him apart
to pull him out.

03:15.559 --> 03:17.154
He could turn to mush any minute.

03:17.323 --> 03:20.034
How did he end up in the trunk
in the first place?

03:20.159 --> 03:21.700
Was he dead when he was put there?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.140
Well, not unless there were like,
five murderers...

03:24.265 --> 03:25.830
or they had a forklift.

03:25.999 --> 03:28.998
Look, we're gonna tow
the car to the morgue.

03:29.123 --> 03:30.745
We'll know more then.

03:32.839 --> 03:36.478
Brenda Leigh, did you use water
or milk to make my oatmeal?

03:36.603 --> 03:37.842
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

03:38.011 --> 03:39.661
It's just water, daddy.

03:39.908 --> 03:42.519
<i>Anyway, we have to be really,
really careful with the body</i>

03:42.644 --> 03:44.139
<i>'cause it's about to explode.</i>

03:44.308 --> 03:46.058
It smells like
it was made with milk.

03:46.467 --> 03:48.271
Daddy, I'm on the phone.

03:49.132 --> 03:51.604
Clay, eat your breakfast
and be quiet.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.942
These straps aren't right,
and your clevis is in the wrong place!

03:55.111 --> 03:56.610
Lieutenant, who's that yelling?

03:57.031 --> 03:59.572
Hey! You telling me I don't know
how to do my job?!

03:59.741 --> 04:03.220
No, I wasn't, but now
that you mention it, you don't!

04:03.345 --> 04:06.620
- Lieutenant, is that det. Sanchez?
- What? No, no. Of course not, Chief.

04:06.902 --> 04:07.704
No.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.917
Did the coroner suggest
how Mr. Adams might have died?

04:12.086 --> 04:15.254
Yeah, he said it was... could be
positional asphyxiation.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.755
<i>But you can't tell for sure</i>

04:16.923 --> 04:19.040
because there's so much
of this guy you can't see.

04:19.165 --> 04:20.884
He's like an iceberg.

04:23.501 --> 04:25.792
He could have died from some bullet
wound to the chest

04:25.917 --> 04:28.099
that never found an exit, or...

04:29.709 --> 04:31.353
- Or...
- get out of the way!

04:31.522 --> 04:32.891
Or what, lieutenant?

04:33.016 --> 04:34.231
- Move!
- Stop!

04:34.604 --> 04:35.711
Or...

04:40.281 --> 04:42.990
he could also have died
from some bizarre traffic accident.

04:43.198 --> 04:44.450
Traffic accident?

04:51.389 --> 04:52.498
Or maybe...

04:56.297 --> 04:57.463
an electrical fire.

05:05.386 --> 05:08.204
Chief, you know,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

05:08.329 --> 05:10.879
Did you put butter
or margarine in this?

05:37.624 --> 05:39.880
That's why we call it
the chop shop! Yes!

05:40.828 --> 05:42.770
Yuck! Terrence! Yuck.

05:44.366 --> 05:48.366
Other than the soup of the day,
what are we looking for in the trunk?

05:48.664 --> 05:51.641
Diamonds, computers,
signs of a struggle,

05:51.766 --> 05:54.728
weapons of mass destruction,
Jimmy Hoffa, anything.

05:56.103 --> 05:59.822
Would you settle for a...
knock-off Hermes bag?

05:59.947 --> 06:01.068
It matches your eyes.

06:02.141 --> 06:04.766
Sgt Gabriel, would you please
have that luggage x-rayed?

06:04.891 --> 06:07.006
We may have a murder here,
but we're also looking

06:07.131 --> 06:08.835
for $3 million in stolen diamonds.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.370
Well, maybe Terrence should
hose it off a lot first...

06:12.540 --> 06:14.080
you know... hose it.

06:14.730 --> 06:17.330
Can you at least give me
a positive I.D.?

06:17.753 --> 06:20.879
- If we could find his mouth.
- I can get dental records, but...

06:21.048 --> 06:22.923
so much has gone wrong here.

06:23.092 --> 06:26.261
He's been dead for days
in the trunk of a car,

06:26.386 --> 06:29.256
and his face exploded in the crash,

06:29.432 --> 06:31.158
and his skin...

06:31.568 --> 06:33.568
yuck, is stuck to his clothes,

06:34.011 --> 06:36.520
and... okay, you know what?
I've seen enough.

06:36.858 --> 06:39.749
- This is a mess.
- What about cause of death?

06:39.874 --> 06:43.574
Due to circumstances beyond my
control, you'll have to tell me.

06:43.828 --> 06:47.810
Maybe he choked to death
on four triple burgers, extra cheese,

06:47.992 --> 06:50.392
six orders of fries,
and a diet coke.

06:50.953 --> 06:51.953
Thank you.

06:53.289 --> 06:55.247
That receipt's from Friday night.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.618
- Oceanside?
- That's just north of San Diego.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.391
Looks like he paid
with a credit card.

07:02.516 --> 07:05.966
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Why the diet coke?

07:06.507 --> 07:08.177
We cut back where we can.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.267
Two hours after closing last Friday,

07:15.458 --> 07:17.937
Phil Adams disables
the store's alarm system

07:18.062 --> 07:22.040
and clears out the diamond safe
of cut and uncut diamonds.

07:22.915 --> 07:24.783
He dumps the diamonds
in his briefcase.

07:24.908 --> 07:26.695
Which is nowhere to be found.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.214
And he heads out.

07:28.939 --> 07:30.315
Took him all of four minutes.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.201
Didn't he know about
the security camera?

07:32.479 --> 07:34.268
The guy just didn't care.

07:34.393 --> 07:37.386
- Which means he's either stupid...
- Or he was coerced.

07:37.511 --> 07:39.421
I thought that he had a plan
that was foolproof.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.946
Next morning, his wife calls in
a missing-persons report.

07:43.656 --> 07:46.215
Security video from the burger-rama
down in Oceanside.

07:46.620 --> 07:49.269
They were able to e-mail me
the footage, two cameras...

07:49.394 --> 07:52.838
but the file was in a high-res format.
So in order to put it on that DVD,

07:52.963 --> 07:54.807
Lieutenant, thank you.
I... thank you.

07:55.084 --> 07:57.184
Anyway, I got the name
off the credit card.

07:58.586 --> 08:01.395
- Sherry Adams.
- The victim's wife!

08:03.617 --> 08:06.212
If she called in a missing-persons,
what is she doing

08:06.337 --> 08:08.317
buying her husband dinner
in Oceanside?

08:08.442 --> 08:11.242
Maybe she didn't know
he had her credit card.

08:11.476 --> 08:12.776
There's his car.

08:15.699 --> 08:17.162
But how do we know who's driving?

08:17.735 --> 08:20.999
I think the way it's listing
to the port side is a major clue.

08:22.948 --> 08:26.004
- You said there was another camera.
- Yes, here comes the other angle.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.051
Hold it.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.879
Who's that guy sitting next to him?

08:35.004 --> 08:36.974
I'm guessing it's not his wife.

08:50.665 --> 08:52.515
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:58.265 --> 09:01.206
- Dreaming about diamonds?
- More about how they disappeared,

09:02.158 --> 09:04.928
and how a man the size of Mr. Adams

09:05.053 --> 09:07.475
wound up in the trunk
of his own car.

09:07.757 --> 09:09.830
And there's a mystery man
in the shadows,

09:09.955 --> 09:12.801
but given Mr. Adams' size,
he's more of an eclipse.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.829
- I mean it, Clay.
- No, Willie Ray, I will not!

09:15.954 --> 09:18.048
Oh, for heaven sakes.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.180
Daddy, what is going on in here?

09:24.305 --> 09:26.221
Your mother wants me to take a walk,

09:26.346 --> 09:28.567
but I'm supposed to avoid
direct sunlight...

09:28.966 --> 09:29.984
carcinoma.

09:30.708 --> 09:34.198
Daddy, you're not gonna catch
skin cancer walking around the block.

09:34.367 --> 09:37.366
I bought this sunscreen
for our trip to Hawaii.

09:39.356 --> 09:42.956
Do we know how this is gonna
interact with my new medication?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.425
You better start worrying about
how I'm gonna interact

09:46.550 --> 09:48.152
with your new medication.

09:48.277 --> 09:49.879
Here. Come on.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.583
Out, out, out.

09:58.107 --> 10:00.590
My father almost died a week ago,

10:00.715 --> 10:03.774
so is it horrible for me to wish
he was on a cruise right now?

10:03.899 --> 10:05.939
- Yes.
- I'm horrible.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.943
You know he's gonna postpone
the cruise until after the wedding.

10:11.803 --> 10:13.488
- Three more weeks?
- Yes.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.156
- Staying here?
- Yes. It's a huge problem.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.244
Not quite as huge
as Phil Adams, but...

10:21.547 --> 10:23.413
You know what's really
beginning to bother me{/ about all this}?

10:23.775 --> 10:25.907
- What?
- The fat jokes.

10:27.246 --> 10:30.002
Oh, you're right. Terrible.

10:30.172 --> 10:34.169
I've been spending much too much time
with lieutenants Flynn and Provenza.

10:45.718 --> 10:48.931
- Has Mrs. Adams arrived?
- Yeah, Gabriel just got here with her.

10:49.056 --> 10:50.565
They're in interview 1.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
Chief?

10:53.828 --> 10:55.828
Mrs. Adams' financial reports.

10:58.112 --> 10:59.157
Okay.

10:59.282 --> 11:00.482
Help yourself.

11:02.138 --> 11:03.744
No, I shouldn't.

11:05.172 --> 11:08.031
Okay, let's see. $38 for fast food.

11:08.156 --> 11:09.681
That we knew about.

11:10.118 --> 11:13.289
Internet charge to <i>quietaffairs.com</i>.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.073
It's a website where
married people... they go...

11:16.198 --> 11:18.802
I think the name "Quiet Affairs"
says it all, Lieutenant.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.761
But, wait... there's more.

11:20.886 --> 11:23.795
A $5,300 charge for plane tickets

11:23.920 --> 11:27.475
from Tijuana to Antwerp
via Mexico City.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.314
Antwerp... that's a great place
to unload stolen diamonds.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.356
Really?

11:33.123 --> 11:34.785
Do we have a passenger list?

11:34.910 --> 11:37.029
Not yet. Aero México
confirmed the three tickets,

11:37.198 --> 11:39.698
but they want a federal warrant
for the passenger manifest,

11:39.823 --> 11:42.062
and since Daniels is not here,
what I need to do...

11:42.187 --> 11:44.587
That's all right.
I believe I know...

11:44.978 --> 11:48.623
two of the names already. I just need
Mrs. Adams to tell me the third.

11:59.596 --> 12:00.760
Mrs. Adams.

12:01.931 --> 12:05.510
I'm deputy chief Brenda L. Johnson.
I am so sorry for your loss.

12:05.635 --> 12:06.773
Thank you.

12:07.388 --> 12:09.603
Do you have idea
who killed my husband?

12:09.889 --> 12:13.315
Not yet, but we're certainly doing
everything in our power to find out.

12:14.189 --> 12:17.027
Now, you reported your husband
missing on Saturday. Is that right?

12:17.632 --> 12:21.629
Yes. He left for work on Friday,
and... never came home,

12:21.984 --> 12:24.575
and so I called the police
the first thing the next morning.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.703
- And you never heard from him again?
- No.

12:27.734 --> 12:30.079
But he did not take those diamonds.

12:30.748 --> 12:34.356
Phil loved that store. He would never
take anything from that store, never.

12:34.481 --> 12:37.297
Ma'am, we have your husband on tape
stealing the diamonds.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.888
- I don't care.
- All right, maybe he didn't...

12:40.013 --> 12:42.970
steal the diamonds. Maybe he was
just taking them for a drive.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.138
But let's talk about
something else for a moment.

12:46.263 --> 12:49.559
Have you ever heard of a website
called quietaffairs.com?

12:50.739 --> 12:51.560
No.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.317
It's a place where married
people go to fool around...

12:58.051 --> 12:59.068
online.

12:59.459 --> 13:02.823
And according to your credit-card
statement, you joined Quiet Affairs

13:03.163 --> 13:05.263
four months ago. Is that right?

13:08.817 --> 13:12.050
Mrs. Adams, normally I wouldn't pry
into someone's personal life,

13:12.175 --> 13:14.709
but your husband was found dead
in the trunk of his car,

13:15.144 --> 13:18.171
and I have to wonder if you
and some boyfriend that you met

13:18.340 --> 13:21.258
- on Quiet Affairs, killed him.
- Boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend.

13:21.427 --> 13:23.510
I would never be unfaithful to Phil.

13:24.293 --> 13:25.293
Really?

13:25.469 --> 13:27.013
Is there any chance that...

13:27.614 --> 13:29.766
you could identify this man for us?

13:31.945 --> 13:32.852
Why?

13:33.206 --> 13:35.856
We have him on tape
in your husband's car.

13:37.593 --> 13:39.400
No. I don't know him.

13:41.926 --> 13:43.864
Okay. So, you don't know
this young man.

13:44.033 --> 13:46.616
But let's just pretend
for a minute that you do...

13:46.785 --> 13:48.952
- and that he was your boyfriend.
- He wasn't, though.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.839
We're just pretending.

13:51.481 --> 13:54.291
And let's say that somehow
you and your boyfriend

13:54.460 --> 13:57.502
manipulated your husband
into stealing millions in diamonds.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.560
- Please, don't...
- but at that last minute,

13:59.685 --> 14:03.008
either your boyfriend pulled a fast one
on you, or you pulled a fast one on him.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.559
Either way, your husband ends up
dead in the trunk of his car,

14:06.684 --> 14:08.889
and somebody walks off
with millions in diamonds,

14:09.561 --> 14:12.434
which is certainly not what Phil
had in mind, because...

14:12.603 --> 14:15.520
his plan involved three
plane tickets to Antwerp.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.488
One for you, one for your husband,
and one for this young man,

14:18.613 --> 14:20.872
who I would very much like
for you to identify.

14:20.997 --> 14:22.694
3 people, 3 plane tickets.

14:27.768 --> 14:29.075
No ticket for me.

14:30.112 --> 14:31.162
Oh, my god.

14:32.823 --> 14:34.073
He was leaving.

14:36.638 --> 14:38.440
How could I be so stupid?

14:41.037 --> 14:43.006
The third plane ticket was for Phil.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.678
The airlines make him buy
two seats whenever he has to fly.

14:50.589 --> 14:51.589
How...

14:52.198 --> 14:54.362
How could you not know about this?

14:54.487 --> 14:56.728
The plane tickets were charged
to your credit card.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.898
Phil was the one who did the
finances, who paid the bills.

15:00.752 --> 15:03.318
He was the one with the account
at Quiet Affairs.

15:03.487 --> 15:04.736
So you knew about this?

15:05.809 --> 15:08.030
Phil met that boy online.

15:08.556 --> 15:11.285
They were messaging or chatting,
whatever you call it,

15:11.410 --> 15:14.538
for the past couple of months.
I caught him doing it,

15:14.663 --> 15:17.362
but he said it was just a...

15:17.487 --> 15:20.752
a fantasy he was living out,
role-playing over the internet.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.030
And you believed him?

15:23.850 --> 15:25.715
Phil gained weight after we married,

15:26.543 --> 15:29.946
and we started having
intimacy issues.

15:31.311 --> 15:34.683
So I thought maybe this was his way
of working through some things.

15:35.685 --> 15:39.144
Besides, he was using a really
old picture on his profile.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.348
I didn't think he'd have the nerve
to meet anybody in person, but...

15:42.473 --> 15:45.823
that is the guy that he was
chatting with. That's him!

15:48.024 --> 15:49.024
Okay.

15:49.658 --> 15:52.409
Well, this young man
may have killed your husband.

15:52.766 --> 15:54.447
What is his name?

15:55.964 --> 15:57.871
<i>Spiceboy85,</i>

15:58.041 --> 16:02.036
<i>A.K.A. Keith Reyes,
737 Las Casas, Echo Park.</i>

16:02.343 --> 16:04.754
Quiet Affairs is cooperating,
discreetly of course.

16:04.923 --> 16:07.454
- OK. That could be him.
- Look who's in his friends file.

16:07.579 --> 16:09.545
Our victim, Phil Adams.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.678
A.K.A. 24carats.

16:11.803 --> 16:14.610
Unfortunately, they don't
archive the chat transcripts.

16:14.735 --> 16:16.277
So unless we recover Mr. Adams'

16:16.402 --> 16:18.977
and Mr. Reyes' computers, we have
no idea what they said to each other.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.272
Chief, if you're going to serve a
warrant in Echo Park, I should be there.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.172
Thank you so much, det. Sanchez,

16:24.297 --> 16:26.960
but I believe the last time you
violated light-restriction duty,

16:27.085 --> 16:30.540
a critical part of our case was
destroyed, namely the victim's body.

16:30.665 --> 16:33.491
- Chief, I think we're on...
- But, Chief, I was the one who told...

16:34.278 --> 16:35.910
So you were there. I knew it!

16:38.667 --> 16:40.967
And the rest of you... I am so mad!

16:42.835 --> 16:45.795
Until you are cleared for full duty,
you are chained to that desk.

16:45.964 --> 16:46.982
Chained!

16:49.040 --> 16:50.258
Warrant, warrant.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.509
Thank you. Sergeant Gabriel.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.602
Way to go, Julio.

16:54.956 --> 16:58.098
If I was in better shape,
I'd kick your ass.

17:10.428 --> 17:13.648
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,
and we're from the L.A.P.D.

17:13.773 --> 17:16.117
We are looking for a Mr. Keith Reyes.
Is he here?

17:17.093 --> 17:18.243
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

17:18.413 --> 17:20.574
Detective Sanchez, of all the days.

17:20.699 --> 17:23.137
Buzz, would you find out
this young woman's information

17:23.262 --> 17:25.710
- while we start the search?
- But, chief, I'm supposed to document

17:25.878 --> 17:27.906
the apartment before you start
looking for anything.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.911
Please just do what I say!

17:30.239 --> 17:32.676
We'll be gentle, but I need to find
out who this young lady is

17:32.972 --> 17:35.733
and what she knows
about Mr. Reyes. Please.

17:36.184 --> 17:37.184
Pardon me.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.247
<i>Qué crees que están haciendo?</i>

17:42.372 --> 17:45.397
<i>- Calma, señora, por favor.
- En puedes entrar aquí sin llarme?</i>

17:47.087 --> 17:51.084
Okay, looking for diamonds, plus-sized
clothing, e-tickets for Belgium,

17:51.864 --> 17:55.073
computers, anything that connects
Mr. Reyes to our victim.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.308
<i>- No pueden hacen eso.
- Señor Reyes está en casa? Sí o no?</i>

17:58.433 --> 18:00.901
<i>Ese idiota.
Le dijo que se sale de aquí.</i>

18:01.026 --> 18:03.576
Chief, she says
Mr. Reyes is an idiot...

18:04.062 --> 18:06.960
... and that he left...
no, she kicked him out.

18:07.224 --> 18:08.229
Chief.

18:08.354 --> 18:11.715
Chief, about Sanchez. I just thought,
you know, if I let him take his time...

18:11.884 --> 18:13.772
And snuck him out on calls
he'd get the message

18:13.897 --> 18:17.053
he could ignore going to therapy?
Which is exactly why he's not here today

18:17.222 --> 18:18.972
when I need him the most.

18:19.407 --> 18:21.438
It's not enough
that he's fit physically.

18:21.563 --> 18:24.113
Behavioral science
has to sign off, too.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.285
No desktop, no laptop.

18:28.410 --> 18:30.663
Okay, Chief, she says
she doesn't have an I.D.

18:30.788 --> 18:33.896
She doesn't want to give her name.
Her accent is really hard to understand.

18:34.021 --> 18:36.766
But from what I can tell,
she's a singer on a cruise ship.

18:36.891 --> 18:38.310
<i>Se fue a viernes.</i>

18:38.435 --> 18:41.103
<i>Sí, sí. Voy a decirle.
Espere momentito.</i>

18:42.360 --> 18:45.290
Keith Reyes left on Friday
and hasn't been back.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.865
<i>... y es una barca...</i>

18:46.990 --> 18:49.039
And now we're making her
late for work,

18:49.164 --> 18:52.967
and she's leaving because
the ship would sail without her.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.709
We can't let her go, Chief.

18:55.834 --> 18:56.879
No, no, no.

18:57.004 --> 18:59.835
Lieutenant, if we want to find out
who she is, we have to let her go.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.639
Buzz, would you hurry her along?

19:14.363 --> 19:15.570
Lieutenant Flynn.

19:24.518 --> 19:27.068
May I see your driver's
license, please?

19:29.616 --> 19:31.503
<i>- Puedo ver su licencia?</i>

19:31.628 --> 19:34.296
<i>Yo te digo, yo no tengo
de identificación.</i>

19:34.944 --> 19:36.925
She says she doesn't have one.

19:37.595 --> 19:39.295
What a shame. Gentlemen.

19:39.629 --> 19:42.430
You are under arrest for operating
a motor vehicle without a license.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.968
Please step out of the car.

19:44.093 --> 19:46.482
<i>Usted tiene el derecho
de permanecer callado,</i>

19:46.607 --> 19:49.325
<i>y usted renuncia el derecho
de permancer callado</i>

19:49.450 --> 19:51.689
<i>cualquier cosa que usted diga
podra usarse y se usará</i>

19:51.858 --> 19:54.525
<i>en su contra
en una corta de justicia.</i>

20:04.299 --> 20:05.549
Who's the babe?

20:06.790 --> 20:10.238
She won't give us her name.
<i>No hablos inglés.</i>

20:10.661 --> 20:12.544
Why don't you grab
her prints for us?

20:12.713 --> 20:13.713
Yes, sir.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.588
Hey, hey, Casanova...
take it easy, huh?

20:17.713 --> 20:18.727
Easy.

20:22.295 --> 20:23.388
<i>Buenos días.</i>

20:24.345 --> 20:25.395
<i>Hola, papí.</i>

20:26.669 --> 20:27.784
<i>Su nombre?</i>

20:29.261 --> 20:30.394
<i>No, no, no.</i>

20:33.784 --> 20:35.821
<i>Casada o soltera?</i>

20:38.143 --> 20:38.944
<i>Qué?</i>

20:40.426 --> 20:42.518
<i>Casada... o soltera?</i>

20:44.691 --> 20:47.412
Are you married, or are you single?

20:49.653 --> 20:50.803
Single.

20:51.596 --> 20:52.634
<i>Y tú?</i>

20:55.088 --> 20:58.004
No, daddy, we don't have
any salt substitute.

20:58.442 --> 20:59.592
I don't know.

21:01.025 --> 21:04.002
No, no. That's the sell-by date,
not the expiration.

21:04.127 --> 21:05.577
I'm sure it's fine.

21:06.943 --> 21:09.100
If you're worried about it,
throw it out then!

21:12.942 --> 21:15.189
Daddy, I'm gonna have to call
you back. Something's come up.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.025
Detective Sanchez!
In my office, please...

21:18.195 --> 21:19.195
now.

21:22.189 --> 21:25.450
Lt Tao, would you please process
these prints as soon as possible?

21:27.482 --> 21:29.537
And, sergeant Gabriel,
if you would escort...

21:30.118 --> 21:32.165
our guest here,
into interview room 1?

21:32.933 --> 21:34.068
Yes, ma'am.

21:37.963 --> 21:41.648
Detective Sanchez, you realize you were
kissing a possible murder suspect?

21:41.773 --> 21:42.800
Yes, ma'am.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.639
And she doesn't know enough spanish
to be from anywhere they speak it,

21:48.152 --> 21:49.891
unless she's really stupid.

21:50.448 --> 21:52.236
And she's not that stupid

21:52.824 --> 21:54.145
cause she's into me.

21:55.915 --> 21:59.538
- I'd be happy to interview her for you.
- I'm sure you would, det. Sanchez,

21:59.663 --> 22:02.445
but the interview room
is a little far from your desk.

22:05.689 --> 22:07.116
Wipe your face.

22:15.975 --> 22:17.227
Good afternoon.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.130
I'm sorry. I forgot.
You don't speak english.

22:21.527 --> 22:23.913
- No habla Inglès?
- No.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.573
You won't understand when I tell you

22:25.698 --> 22:28.098
that I'm about to book you
for driving without a license,

22:28.223 --> 22:30.515
put you in the county jail,
and lock you up for the next

22:30.683 --> 22:33.518
48 hours until you're arraigned,
at which time you'll have to come up

22:33.686 --> 22:35.269
with over $2,000 in bail.

22:38.174 --> 22:39.217
Fine.

22:40.055 --> 22:41.411
What do you want to know?

22:41.536 --> 22:43.186
Now she speaks english.

22:43.392 --> 22:45.737
Well, good.
Now that I can communicate with you,

22:45.862 --> 22:47.819
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask. So,

22:47.944 --> 22:50.535
let's get started, shall we?
First,

22:50.703 --> 22:53.786
- why did you refuse to speak english?
- Is there a law against that?

22:53.911 --> 22:56.374
No, I don't think so.
Nextpregunta, please.

22:59.869 --> 23:01.669
How do you know Mr. Reyes?

23:02.510 --> 23:05.383
- He was one of my boyfriends.
- One of your boyfriends?

23:05.551 --> 23:06.384
Yes.

23:08.816 --> 23:11.127
You seem to be feeling better
all of a sudden.

23:11.252 --> 23:12.765
How long have you known Mr. Reyes?

23:14.144 --> 23:15.363
Too long.

23:16.253 --> 23:17.770
When was the last time you saw him?

23:18.046 --> 23:19.689
I kicked his ass out a week ago,

23:19.814 --> 23:21.746
when I find out that
he don't like girls no more.

23:21.871 --> 23:24.819
- And you haven't seen him since?
- No. Have you?

23:24.987 --> 23:27.488
Because if he comes around again,
he's gonna need police protection.

23:28.093 --> 23:29.198
Where's the chief?

23:29.562 --> 23:32.035
Interview 1 with tequila rose.

23:34.315 --> 23:36.776
- He didn't tell you where he was going?
- I told you.

23:36.901 --> 23:38.454
I don't know where he is.

23:38.579 --> 23:39.897
Can I go now?

23:41.950 --> 23:42.962
Thank you.

24:01.636 --> 24:03.572
Do you know
what I've just been handed?

24:03.697 --> 24:06.397
Hopefully a menu mamà,
'cause I'm starving.

24:07.644 --> 24:09.071
You're criminal record,

24:09.196 --> 24:11.699
and it gives me a very good idea
where to find your boyfriend, Keith.

24:12.425 --> 24:13.659
Ex-boyfriend.

24:25.646 --> 24:28.749
Keith Reyes, you're under arrest for
grand theft and murder of Phil Adams.

24:28.874 --> 24:30.944
Sgt Gabriel, would you
please read him his rights?

24:31.069 --> 24:34.013
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used

24:34.181 --> 24:36.583
against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.202
If you cannot afford one, it will be
appointed to you by the state.

24:39.327 --> 24:42.105
Have you heard
and understood these rights, sir?

24:42.994 --> 24:45.464
Tell the chief I went to therapy.

24:49.788 --> 24:53.449
So, we searched Keith Reyes' residence,
no diamonds, no laptop.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.057
We had undercover stake it out
just in case he showed up.

24:56.182 --> 24:59.205
But as it turns out,
he was already in custody.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.741
I thought we had
his girlfriend in custody.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.341
They're very close.

25:04.466 --> 25:07.547
You might be interested to know,
Mr. Reyes, that we found Phil Adams

25:07.715 --> 25:11.509
yesterday morning very, very dead
and partially decomposed.

25:12.408 --> 25:14.220
<i>Wait, what?!</i>

25:14.841 --> 25:17.141
- Phil's really dead?
- Yes, he is.

25:17.707 --> 25:19.860
And do you want to know
where we found him?

25:19.985 --> 25:22.562
Man, don't tell me he was still
in the trunk of his car.

25:25.146 --> 25:26.248
That was too easy.

25:26.373 --> 25:27.942
That's exactly where we found him,

25:28.110 --> 25:30.236
and that is the first straight
answer you've given me.

25:30.404 --> 25:32.905
Mr. Reyes, I have to tell you,
you are testing my temper.

25:33.473 --> 25:34.574
I apologize.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.243
But when you showed up today,
I was late for work,

25:37.690 --> 25:39.740
and I didn't want to get fired.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.914
What is it exactly that you do?

25:42.767 --> 25:43.833
I'm an illusionist.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.115
So, what,
you're a female impersonator?

25:48.240 --> 25:50.089
No. I don't do drag.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.426
What you saw today was magic.

25:55.338 --> 25:57.032
And where do you perform?

25:57.157 --> 25:58.212
I told you...

25:58.337 --> 26:00.094
On a cruise ship.
I sing in the lounge.

26:00.219 --> 26:02.602
Is that where you met Mr. Adams?
On the cruise ship?

26:02.770 --> 26:05.260
No, Phil never knew anything
about my work.

26:05.385 --> 26:08.225
I mean, we only met in person once
last friday evening.

26:08.350 --> 26:10.026
The rest of our relationship
was online.

26:10.194 --> 26:14.113
Are you telling me that the first time
you met Phil Adams in person

26:14.281 --> 26:16.028
was the night that you murdered him?

26:16.153 --> 26:17.450
I didn't murder him.

26:17.936 --> 26:19.994
And besides,
he put himself in that trunk.

26:20.325 --> 26:22.975
Did you notice how big he was?
Look at me.

26:23.301 --> 26:25.279
I couldn't have
put him in there if I tried.

26:25.404 --> 26:29.295
Are you saying he put himself in
the trunk of that car of his own accord?

26:29.463 --> 26:31.797
I have to tell you,
I find that very, very strange.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.799
The whole night was strange.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.010
It started the moment he showed up.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.137
Look, he didn't look
anything like his photo.

26:38.492 --> 26:40.556
I mean, the guy totally lied
about himself.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.100
- He was enormous.
- You got in the car with him anyway.

26:43.708 --> 26:46.771
It would have been really rude to take
one look at him and say, "see you."

26:47.452 --> 26:49.023
I mean, everybody's got feelings.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.308
And what did you two do?

26:52.433 --> 26:55.760
Well, there was no way
I was taking him back to my place.

26:55.885 --> 26:57.835
I thought we'd go get dinner,

26:58.012 --> 26:59.492
but then we started driving.

27:00.580 --> 27:03.495
And I started to get nervous.
And he told me, "don't worry.

27:03.620 --> 27:04.997
I have a surprise for you."

27:05.345 --> 27:07.972
<i>So, I thought, "okay."
But then we passed san diego.</i>

27:08.097 --> 27:10.342
<i>And he pulls over, and he says:</i>

27:10.467 --> 27:13.005
<i>"I'm gonna get into the trunk
just until we cross the border."</i>

27:13.908 --> 27:16.050
Now, that's a little weird, right?

27:16.902 --> 27:19.011
So, I ask him,
"why do you want to get in the trunk?"

27:19.342 --> 27:22.348
And he tells me that it's
all part of the surprise.

27:24.216 --> 27:25.852
And what was the surprise?

27:25.977 --> 27:27.603
$3 million in stolen diamonds?

27:30.378 --> 27:31.755
And what about this?

27:31.880 --> 27:35.695
A plane ticket in your name
out of mexico to Europe?

27:37.275 --> 27:38.575
Are you kidding?

27:39.528 --> 27:40.825
<i>Why wouldn't he tell me?</i>

27:40.993 --> 27:43.068
Where in Europe?
I totally would have gone for that.

27:43.193 --> 27:46.456
So, so, you're saying the diamonds,
the plane tickets...

27:46.581 --> 27:48.207
You don't know anything about that?

27:48.654 --> 27:50.782
Look, he got in the trunk,
and I freaked out.

27:50.907 --> 27:53.657
So I turned around,
and I drove back to L.A.

27:54.917 --> 27:58.718
Look, I thought he had a gun
or drugs or something weird.

28:01.090 --> 28:02.903
I am such an idiot.

28:04.424 --> 28:06.851
$3 million? Really?

28:07.748 --> 28:10.477
Buzz, will you tell chief Johnson
to come to my office, please?

28:10.602 --> 28:13.460
I need to speak with her...
immediately.

28:17.758 --> 28:21.073
<i>Chief Pope wants you
to end the interview... now.</i>

28:25.117 --> 28:27.654
While I'm impressed
your crack team of detectives

28:27.779 --> 28:31.329
used fingerprints to reveal that
a female suspect was a man,

28:31.851 --> 28:34.183
you have no diamonds,
you have no conspiracy,

28:34.308 --> 28:36.422
and you definitely
don't have a murder.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.799
If Mr. Reyes put Mr. Adams
in the trunk of that car...

28:39.113 --> 28:41.049
There is nothing to prove
that he did.

28:41.174 --> 28:43.769
Reyes seduced Phil Adams
into stealing those diamonds

28:43.894 --> 28:46.098
and leaving his wife
to become a fugitive in antwerp.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.751
It would have been easy for him
to convince that poor man

28:48.876 --> 28:52.243
to get into the trunk of his car so
he could cross the border unrecognized.

28:52.368 --> 28:53.903
But they didn't drive to mexico.

28:54.028 --> 28:55.801
He drove him back here,
and that is murder.

28:55.926 --> 28:58.327
Even if it happened exactly
as you described,

28:58.452 --> 29:01.280
Adams got into the trunk of that car
without being physically forced,

29:01.619 --> 29:03.949
and he suffocated from the pressure
of his own weight.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.826
And that is not murder.

29:06.114 --> 29:08.468
I've spoken
to the district attorney himself,

29:08.593 --> 29:12.023
and we have nothing proving
Mr. Reyes intended Mr. Adams to die.

29:12.148 --> 29:13.793
Without intent, there's no murder.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.081
Manslaughter, then.

29:15.206 --> 29:17.922
Mr. Reyes walked off and left Mr. Adams
in the trunk of that car.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.216
- Not against the law.
- He didn't report the body.

29:20.663 --> 29:24.345
Failure to report a dead body
is also not against the law.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.686
I can't arrest him for anything.

29:36.755 --> 29:39.133
Find the diamonds,
connect them to your suspect,

29:39.258 --> 29:42.863
and prove that he was involved
in a conspiracy to commit grand theft,

29:43.372 --> 29:44.485
and maybe...

29:44.904 --> 29:47.326
maybe we can get him
for manslaughter.

29:49.098 --> 29:51.288
Reyes killed Phil Adams.
I know it.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.541
Believing something
to be true and proving it...

29:53.666 --> 29:55.216
Two different things.

29:56.163 --> 29:58.899
Connect him
to the diamonds or let him go.

30:08.341 --> 30:09.348
Food's here!

30:11.518 --> 30:12.765
Don't come in here!

30:12.890 --> 30:14.428
Okay, okay!

30:15.606 --> 30:16.939
Not looking. Not looking.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.236
What in the sam hill is that?

30:22.400 --> 30:25.215
I know you're watching your diet, Clay.
That pizza's good for your heart.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.490
Vegetarian: no meat,

30:27.659 --> 30:28.617
no cheese.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.935
No meat, no cheese?

30:31.882 --> 30:33.539
No pizza.
What do you got in there?

30:36.272 --> 30:38.458
Hey, Brenda, you find your guy?

30:38.583 --> 30:40.546
Yes, once I figured out who she was.

30:40.778 --> 30:41.792
"She"?

30:41.917 --> 30:44.008
Well, she was a he
who dressed like a she.

30:45.542 --> 30:46.552
A lady fella?

30:46.773 --> 30:49.338
We got to check on it, but I think
the proper term is transvestite.

30:49.463 --> 30:51.474
No, no. He doesn't call himself
a transvestite.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.613
He's an illusionist.

30:53.997 --> 30:56.604
He's also a bit of a magician.
He somehow managed to make

30:56.772 --> 30:59.709
$3 million in diamonds
vanish into thin air.

31:02.807 --> 31:04.835
I'm gonna put this pizza on a plate.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.697
- All finished.
- Okay.

31:09.007 --> 31:11.321
Oh, ma. It's beautiful.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.610
I'm so glad you like it.

31:14.037 --> 31:17.337
I knew I was hanging on to this gown
for a good reason.

31:17.938 --> 31:20.020
And now we can go on

31:20.145 --> 31:23.836
our 50th-wedding-anniversary
hawaiian cruise

31:23.961 --> 31:25.487
for some fun in the sun.

31:25.612 --> 31:29.553
Willie Ray, I'm in no condition to go
on the ocean without a doctor's care.

31:29.877 --> 31:32.733
Well, I'll Miss you, Clay,
but I'm leaving tomorrow.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.694
Tomorrow?
You're leaving tomorrow?

31:34.819 --> 31:36.488
Don't look so disappointed, dear.

31:36.613 --> 31:39.375
We... we... can't leave tomorrow!

31:39.500 --> 31:41.833
Are you deliberately
trying to kill me?

31:41.958 --> 31:44.508
Yes, and I'd want you
to die with a tan.

31:45.395 --> 31:48.169
I'll miss you, but I'm not
missing that cruse

31:48.294 --> 31:50.380
Because you're imagining
health problems.

31:50.505 --> 31:52.910
That stent collapsing
was not imaginary.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.486
That was a week ago.

31:54.611 --> 31:56.747
Quit living in the past.
Go and pack

31:56.915 --> 31:59.458
because you're either
going home to Atlanta,

31:59.755 --> 32:01.933
or you're going
to the south pacific with me.

32:02.058 --> 32:03.331
I mean it, Clay.

32:03.456 --> 32:06.257
Daddy, Hawaii's a much nicer place
to get better.

32:06.934 --> 32:09.635
Clay, would you rather die
in Atlanta or paradise?

32:10.529 --> 32:12.874
I hope y'all remember this moment

32:12.999 --> 32:14.557
when they bury me at sea.

32:23.805 --> 32:25.733
Ma, it's just lovely.

32:26.788 --> 32:29.125
Thank you so much for making me
look so beautiful.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.893
You're very welcome.

32:31.490 --> 32:35.040
That's what a wedding dress should do.
Maximize your assets.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.466
Excuse me while I

32:38.745 --> 32:41.499
tend to my patient in the I.C.U.

33:05.192 --> 33:08.694
- Okay, where do you want him, chief?
- In my office would be fine.

33:10.303 --> 33:13.782
I have just received word that
you have been cleared for full duty.

33:14.303 --> 33:15.380
Chief,

33:15.834 --> 33:18.037
if you're gonna ask me
to go in there with you,

33:19.504 --> 33:22.541
I would like to request just one
more day chained to my desk.

33:39.391 --> 33:42.227
Good news, Mr. Reyes.
You're being released.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.979
I bet you'll be happy to go home

33:44.147 --> 33:47.297
and change into something
a little more comfortable.

33:48.428 --> 33:50.527
I just need you to sign here,
confirming

33:50.695 --> 33:53.395
that you have received
all your belongings.

33:57.878 --> 34:00.178
All right, then.
You're free to go.

34:04.402 --> 34:07.752
I just have one little question for you,
off the record.

34:08.235 --> 34:09.672
And what's that?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.275
The only reason you got
into that car with Mr. Adams

34:12.400 --> 34:16.002
was because you were trying to be polite
to someone that you met online...

34:16.127 --> 34:18.013
Not because of diamonds,
is that right?

34:18.505 --> 34:20.431
I never knew anything
about any diamonds.

34:21.471 --> 34:24.018
That's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

34:31.005 --> 34:33.755
Only real diamonds
can cut glass, Mr. Reyes.

34:35.186 --> 34:37.722
Since everything you've told me
so far has been a lie,

34:37.847 --> 34:39.326
what do you say we start over?

34:40.063 --> 34:43.080
I didn't kill anyone,
and I haven't done anything wrong.

34:43.702 --> 34:45.791
What about all those diamonds
sewn into your dress?

34:46.384 --> 34:48.377
Actually, I used fabric glue.

34:48.632 --> 34:51.088
So you could step off that cruise ship
and sail through customs

34:51.516 --> 34:53.632
with $3 million in stolen gems.

34:55.077 --> 34:57.498
<i>How was I supposed to know
they were stolen?</i>

34:57.623 --> 35:00.639
Phil gave me those diamonds.
I thought they were fake.

35:01.277 --> 35:02.529
Can you believe this guy?

35:02.654 --> 35:04.365
I didn't believe him
when he was a woman.

35:04.490 --> 35:06.668
But once he got into the trunk,
I started thinking...

35:06.793 --> 35:09.273
Yeah, you started thinking,
"Yay, I've got the diamonds."

35:09.441 --> 35:12.506
No, I started thinking,
"What did I get myself into?

35:12.631 --> 35:14.027
What if this guy is crazy?"

35:15.202 --> 35:17.202
Listen, I didn't kill anybody.

35:17.763 --> 35:19.658
I was just trying
to avoid a bad situation.

35:19.904 --> 35:21.204
A bad situation?

35:22.274 --> 35:24.037
Let me tell you
about a bad situation.

35:24.205 --> 35:27.161
Locking a man in the trunk of his car
with no water and very little air,

35:27.286 --> 35:28.709
that is a bad situation.

35:31.669 --> 35:33.422
You're good
at conjuring up a fantasy.

35:34.297 --> 35:36.747
Let me tell you
about one that I have.

35:37.205 --> 35:38.594
You meet Mr. Adams online.

35:39.192 --> 35:42.139
He was a married man, but he was also
a repressed homosexual.

35:43.703 --> 35:45.213
I'd be willing to bet

35:45.338 --> 35:46.643
that you stalked him,

35:46.811 --> 35:48.645
saw that he worked
at a jewelry store, and,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.291
knowing he was vulnerable,
started making promises you knew

35:51.416 --> 35:53.025
he'd be all too willing to accept.

35:54.265 --> 35:57.321
Lady, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.507
You conned Mr. Adams
into the trunk of that car

35:59.632 --> 36:02.802
with no intention of ever letting
him out! That sounds like murder to me.

36:02.927 --> 36:06.887
Look, Phil got in the trunk to cross
the border without telling me why.

36:07.012 --> 36:09.048
Probably because
he stole a lot of diamonds

36:09.173 --> 36:11.726
and he thought people
would be looking for him.

36:11.851 --> 36:15.143
Instead of having the Mexican
border patrol discover some

36:15.268 --> 36:17.618
fat guy who lied to me in the trunk,

36:17.883 --> 36:19.426
I drove him back to Los Angeles.

36:20.150 --> 36:23.307
Well, you know, we could still get you
for the possession of stolen property.

36:23.432 --> 36:26.172
Your story's changed so many times.
"I only speak Spanish.

36:26.297 --> 36:29.561
Oh, wait, I speak English.
"I'm a woman. Oh, wait, I'm a man.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.940
"What diamonds? Oh, those diamonds.
He gave me these diamonds."

36:36.269 --> 36:38.987
Sergeant Gabriel, what is
the minimum sentence for grand theft?

36:39.756 --> 36:40.769
8 to 10 years.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.908
That gives me plenty of time
to find evidence

36:43.076 --> 36:45.327
that proves you murdered Mr. Adams.

36:47.147 --> 36:49.947
I told you.
I thought the diamonds were fake.

36:50.134 --> 36:51.792
So good luck with your possession.

36:52.269 --> 36:56.213
<i>And I didn't rob his store.
So good luck with your grand theft.</i>

36:57.485 --> 36:58.757
He's absolutely right.

36:58.997 --> 37:00.342
We have nothing on him.

37:02.965 --> 37:05.665
You thought this out
from beginning to end.

37:06.094 --> 37:08.548
Every question I've asked,
you've had an answer for.

37:08.673 --> 37:11.770
It's almost like you've imagined these
interviews before they took place.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.189
I think you're the one
imaging things.

37:15.376 --> 37:17.026
Because you want us to.

37:17.641 --> 37:19.010
Like right now...

37:19.581 --> 37:22.114
You think you look innocent,
but you don't.

37:22.873 --> 37:24.616
It's just another
one of your tricks.

37:25.790 --> 37:27.369
And my best one's yet to come...

37:29.433 --> 37:32.130
... because since you have nothing
to charge me with,

37:32.255 --> 37:34.418
tomorrow you get to watch me
walk out of here

37:36.254 --> 37:37.963
and completely disappear.

37:42.216 --> 37:45.596
I want to thank you for taking such
good care of your mother and me.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.557
Oh, daddy, of course. I love you.

37:48.954 --> 37:50.890
Clay, we don't want to be late.

37:51.015 --> 37:54.011
I'm saying goodbye to my daughter,
if you don't mind.

37:54.136 --> 37:55.959
Don't you mean "aloha"?

37:57.100 --> 37:58.734
We're not there yet.

38:00.162 --> 38:01.714
Bye, mama.
Have a safe trip

38:01.839 --> 38:03.530
and make sure daddy
stays on his diet.

38:04.023 --> 38:07.478
I expect he'll do as well as
you do avoiding sugar.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.173
Bags are all loaded.

38:09.298 --> 38:11.048
- Bye, Fritz.
- Bye-bye.

38:15.846 --> 38:16.996
They're gone.

38:21.056 --> 38:24.468
Which means we finally have
some privacy,

38:25.549 --> 38:27.799
where we can do whatever we want...

38:29.609 --> 38:31.224
As many times as we want.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.021
I know you're distracted.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.263
I know you're still trying to

38:37.034 --> 38:38.151
trap your

38:39.161 --> 38:40.692
Houdini with the diamonds.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.865
Yes.

38:46.639 --> 38:47.866
Want to know a secret?

38:48.034 --> 38:49.191
Yes, I do.

38:50.209 --> 38:53.109
You know the interesting thing
about illusions?

38:53.596 --> 38:57.209
It's that the magician rehearses over
and over again until it's perfect.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.877
But practice
doesn't just make perfect.

39:00.003 --> 39:01.755
It makes a pattern.

39:02.556 --> 39:04.366
And if you have a pattern,

39:04.586 --> 39:06.510
you can prove intent.

39:07.684 --> 39:09.203
And with intent...

39:10.321 --> 39:12.427
You get... murder.

39:12.886 --> 39:14.017
How did you...

39:14.271 --> 39:15.481
How did you?

39:17.178 --> 39:19.248
- What is this?
- The fat jokes, they bothered me.

39:19.373 --> 39:21.625
I knew I heard them somewhere before,
and then I remembered.

39:21.745 --> 39:24.555
They came up in an FBI case
that was never solved.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.573
"An obese bank manager
in Arizona" was found dead

39:27.698 --> 39:31.695
in the trunk of his car after stealing
$2 million from his branch office."

39:33.358 --> 39:34.871
This has nothing to do with me.

39:36.005 --> 39:37.582
I've never heard of this guy, and

39:38.379 --> 39:41.629
you have about 30 minutes
before you have to charge me

39:41.768 --> 39:43.053
or let me go.

39:43.378 --> 39:46.325
I've accepted the fact
that I have to release you, but

39:46.450 --> 39:49.500
let's sort out some
business here first, shall we?

39:49.782 --> 39:52.055
The FBI never figured out

39:53.600 --> 39:56.898
how this poor old bank manager
ended up in the trunk of his car,

39:57.023 --> 39:59.194
nor did we find
the $2 million he stole.

39:59.319 --> 40:01.231
We do know he didn't act alone.

40:02.442 --> 40:06.236
He was trading e-mails, planning
the theft with a young lady.

40:06.475 --> 40:09.413
We even have
surveillance video of the girl

40:10.033 --> 40:13.785
walking up to his car
right after the robbery.

40:15.392 --> 40:17.914
Ladies and gentlemen,
may we present the amazing

40:18.955 --> 40:20.315
Mr. Keith Reyes?

40:24.208 --> 40:27.095
That's how you anticipated
everything I could possibly ask you,

40:27.220 --> 40:29.420
because you've done it all before.

40:29.599 --> 40:32.084
Hey, I had nothing to do
with that guy's death.

40:32.209 --> 40:34.306
- It's the same as Phil.
- Sorry, Keith.

40:34.542 --> 40:37.642
I know how much a magician hates
to have his trade secrets exposed.

40:38.473 --> 40:41.271
But here's the thing, you perform
a trick like that more than once,

40:41.558 --> 40:42.856
you establish a pattern.

40:43.144 --> 40:45.487
And with a pattern,
you create intent.

40:45.612 --> 40:48.111
And with intent, you get murder
in the first degree.

40:53.399 --> 40:55.660
- You said you were gonna release me.
- I am...

40:56.621 --> 40:58.288
To the FBI and the Tucson police.

40:58.781 --> 41:00.833
I'm gonna arrest you
for bank robbery.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.358
These guys are probably gonna want
to try you for murder.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.380
We'll sort out who goes first
on your way back to Arizona.

41:09.119 --> 41:11.885
And just as you predicted,
you're gonna walk out of here today

41:13.471 --> 41:15.055
and completely disappear.

41:17.830 --> 41:18.830
Well,

41:19.900 --> 41:21.235
now you see me.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.756
And now you don't.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.282
Try and keep the rabbit
in the hat this time, will you?
