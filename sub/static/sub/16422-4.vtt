38:18.356 --> 38:20.389
Well, I've never met one before.

You have. You just haven't known it.

38:28.456 --> 38:29.622
James.

38:29.623 --> 38:30.622
James Bligh.

38:30.623 --> 38:32.422
- Yes.
- Now you <i>are</i> having me on.

38:32.423 --> 38:35.221
Harry ran tonight because he
saw James at the hospital.

38:35.222 --> 38:37.489
- James is a married man.
- Yes, but...

38:38.957 --> 38:40.889
As I'm dragging you into
the middle of this,

38:40.890 --> 38:42.923
you deserve the whole truth.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.823
Blokes and blokes.

38:49.122 --> 38:51.288
It's not natural.

38:51.289 --> 38:53.555
If you'd rather Harry didn't
stay, I can't force you.

38:53.556 --> 38:55.755
A-And all this "He
can't see me" stuff...

38:55.756 --> 38:56.823
What's that about?

38:57.890 --> 38:59.622
James and he were
attracted to each other.

38:59.623 --> 39:02.156
I imagine that's why Harry left town.

39:03.189 --> 39:05.690
Things that go on behind a bloke's back.

39:06.790 --> 39:09.556
I should let the hospital know.
They'll be worried.

39:15.556 --> 39:17.289
You want to help him.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.156
He has no one else.

39:19.823 --> 39:22.089
Well, we'll see how it goes, eh?

39:23.723 --> 39:25.923
So long as he doesn't
give <i>me the glad eye.</i>

39:26.890 --> 39:28.389
I think you'll be safe.

It will be locked every

I awoke to the odor of Fleur

40:34.890 --> 40:35.989
She was in your room?

40:35.990 --> 40:37.589
While I was asleep.

40:37.590 --> 40:39.155
That is positively sinister.

40:39.156 --> 40:40.890
Indeed it is.

41:00.923 --> 41:04.488
The vile creature tried
to put the blame on you.

41:04.489 --> 41:06.289
He had the gall to smirk.

41:07.156 --> 41:09.322
It was a moment of impulse.

Firstly, Regina.

43:45.756 --> 43:47.355
I have been unfair to you.

43:47.356 --> 43:49.088
You're right in what
you said last night...

43:49.089 --> 43:52.155
I thought more of myself in
marrying than I did of you.

43:52.156 --> 43:56.555
I should have made my
expectations much clearer.

43:56.556 --> 43:57.822
I will do so now

43:57.823 --> 43:59.957
so we all understand the situation.

44:00.756 --> 44:03.355
You're my wife in name only.

44:03.356 --> 44:05.221
You are not the mistress of Ash Park.

44:05.222 --> 44:07.289
- George...
- Be quiet!

44:08.690 --> 44:11.523
There is no mistress of Ash Park.

44:14.957 --> 44:17.022
Mother, I'm glad to see you back,

44:17.023 --> 44:18.889
but the bitterness that
came between us before

44:18.890 --> 44:21.288
could well return if you
assume that role again.

44:21.289 --> 44:24.956
Ash Park will always be your
home, but not your domain.

44:24.957 --> 44:28.288
That is an old concept linked
to the family as it was.

44:28.289 --> 44:31.556
But too much has changed for
us to cling to old concepts.

44:33.222 --> 44:36.121

44:36.122 --> 44:40.089
hopefully with no animosity,
for the sake of Georgie.

We have our first budding
author and winemaker.

44:45.489 --> 44:48.088

to finance your venture

44:48.089 --> 44:50.288

George, I-I would never have asked.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.856
I'm very happy to offer.

45:00.556 --> 45:02.956

moving back into the house.

move you to the cottage.

leading up to the election,

animosity can be avoided.
