newscaster #3:
Police are now pushing...

00:19.519 --> 00:21.783
newscaster #4:
...the Feds are telling us
it is not a terror attack.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.380
It is most likely an accident.

00:24.457 --> 00:26.948
newscaster #5:
...the Fire Department
is calling a major emergency.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.619

Not all things in the world

00:36.770 --> 00:38.738
are quite as they first appear.

00:41.474 --> 00:45.308
Every seven years in an ordinary town,

00:45.378 --> 00:47.846
an extraordinary event takes place.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.841
You won't know it...

00:51.885 --> 00:53.182
you won't see it...

00:59.159 --> 01:00.683
...but it happens.

Don't let it be him, Joshua:
not him:

01:38.932 --> 01:41.958
Man:
Mr: Harlow!

01:43.770 --> 01:46.136
What's the matter, Mr: Harlow?

01:46.206 --> 01:47.730
Are you out of bullets?

01:47.807 --> 01:49.934
Here, have some of mine!

Joshua!

02:24.477 --> 02:27.241
To be quite frank with you,

02:27.313 --> 02:29.747
you're a stain on our profession:

02:29.816 --> 02:33.582
I'm beyond fucking insulted:

02:33.653 --> 02:34.950
So:::

02:36.489 --> 02:38.753
come on out

02:38.825 --> 02:39.917
and I'll show you

02:39.993 --> 02:44.123

Congratulations, man:

03:50.563 --> 03:51.928
Thanks:

03:53.733 --> 03:54.859
I'm glad it was you:

04:09.315 --> 04:11.215
Enjoy your life together:

08:23.503 --> 08:25.937
particularly gang-related gun crime,

08:26.005 --> 08:28.769
which is leaving residents
in a constant state of fear.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.674
There were calls last night
for further investment

08:31.744 --> 08:34.871
in the city's under-manned
police force, as often--

08:34.947 --> 08:35.777
[sighs]

08:35.847 --> 08:37.315
Another day in the borough:

08:43.722 --> 08:44.655
[glass clinks]

08:44.724 --> 08:46.487
All right, you:
Come on:

08:46.559 --> 08:47.583
out:

08:47.660 --> 08:49.787
You been here long enough:

08:49.862 --> 08:52.023
- Closing time, eh?
- opening time:

08:52.098 --> 08:54.965
How many times have
I told you about this?

08:55.034 --> 08:55.966
Come on, out:

08:56.035 --> 08:57.468
What did I do last night?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.267
It's not what you did,
it's how much you drank:

09:00.339 --> 09:02.170
You're a disgrace, you know that?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.804
You dirty bastard:
Right:

09:07.880 --> 09:09.074
Sorry:

09:09.148 --> 09:10.274
Sorry:

09:12.385 --> 09:14.114
Here:
Don't forget this:

09:15.721 --> 09:19.418
now piss off, Father:
You're barred!

Almost got it:

09:40.413 --> 09:42.881
I'm into the ccTV mainframe:

09:42.949 --> 09:45.611
That is tasty and invisible:

09:45.685 --> 09:46.674
Thank you:
Watch and learn:

09:46.752 --> 09:48.049
- Rerouting:
- Thank you:

09:48.120 --> 09:52.352
Rerouted CCTV footage is online:

09:52.425 --> 09:53.824

09:53.893 --> 09:55.690
Rerouted ccTV confirmed

09:55.761 --> 09:57.695
on all grid sections A through to B:

09:57.763 --> 09:59.287
We have coverage of the entire city:

09:59.365 --> 10:00.855
Abso-fucking-lutely:

10:00.933 --> 10:02.230
Good:
Visuals on the standby?

10:02.301 --> 10:04.292
All available motion detectors
and hidden cameras

10:04.370 --> 10:05.302
are active and responsive:

10:05.371 --> 10:06.861

Please hold while we try to connect you.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.275
Emergency radio frequencies

10:13.346 --> 10:15.906
Lock everything:
Prepare to go live:

10:17.249 --> 10:18.375
We're up:

10:18.451 --> 10:20.351
About time:
What's our status?

10:20.419 --> 10:22.717
Woman:
Some of the long hauls
are a little late rising,

10:22.788 --> 10:24.050
but the majority are up and about.

10:24.123 --> 10:24.885
And the implants?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.720
The surgery teams
completed overnight.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.056
Good:
Make sure the cleanup crews are ready:

10:29.128 --> 10:31.119
They're going to have a busy day:

10:31.797 --> 10:33.890
Ladies and gentlemen:::

10:33.966 --> 10:36.332
welcome to the Tournament:

10:36.402 --> 10:38.734
[applause]

10:38.804 --> 10:40.567
It is my honor

10:40.640 --> 10:43.575
to be your host
for this legendary event,

10:43.643 --> 10:46.908
being held for the first time
here in Great Britain:

10:46.979 --> 10:49.413
With more CCTV
than anywhere else on Earth,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.347
we shouldn't miss a thing:

10:51.417 --> 10:53.146
[laughing]

10:53.219 --> 10:57.087
now, as you know,

10:57.156 --> 11:00.250
the stakes in this room are high,

11:00.326 --> 11:02.123
but the stakes
for our competitors out there

11:02.194 --> 11:04.424
are the highest possible:

11:04.497 --> 11:05.657
At this very moment,

11:05.731 --> 11:07.756
30 of the world's greatest assassins

11:07.833 --> 11:09.824
are preparing for
the ultimate sporting event:

11:11.203 --> 11:14.730
International killers
of every imaginable discipline

11:14.807 --> 11:17.435
will compete
for a $10 million cash prize

11:17.510 --> 11:20.035
and the honorable title
of the "World's Best:"

11:22.682 --> 11:25.617
our lovely ladies are
standing by to take your bets:

11:25.685 --> 11:27.778
100K minimum stake:

11:27.853 --> 11:30.947
And here are a few
of my personal favorites

11:31.023 --> 11:33.184
you may wish to keep your eye on:

11:33.259 --> 11:35.124
- Visuals online:
- Go to seven:

11:35.194 --> 11:37.219
- Go to seven, Rob:
- And cue:

11:37.296 --> 11:42.632
Lai Lai Zhen,
abandoned at birth and left for dead:

11:42.702 --> 11:44.602
At 17, she was killing
for the Triads

11:44.670 --> 11:46.797
and has grown up to become
the number one hitter

11:46.872 --> 11:49.898
in the Eastern market
for the past three years--

11:49.975 --> 11:52.808
a snip at 10 to 1 :

11:52.878 --> 11:54.812
[applause]

11:56.649 --> 11:58.640
Anton Bogart:

11:58.718 --> 11:59.810
An outstanding athlete,

11:59.885 --> 12:02.115
he lives for the thrill of the hunt:

12:02.188 --> 12:03.951
Silent, stealthy, smart--

12:04.023 --> 12:05.320
a lethal option:

12:06.225 --> 12:07.522
9 to 1 :

12:10.162 --> 12:13.359
Yuri Petrov,
Russian special forces:

12:13.432 --> 12:16.492
An incredible all-rounder
armed to the teeth:

12:16.569 --> 12:18.833
Fists, feet, bullets, bombs--

12:18.904 --> 12:21.429
utterly merciless,
he has it all:

12:25.244 --> 12:28.839
Miles Slade, the crazy Texan kid:

12:28.914 --> 12:30.347
An outside bet,

12:30.416 --> 12:32.646
but he's mad enough
to rise the ranks:

12:32.718 --> 12:34.845
Reckless, ruthless, wild,

12:34.920 --> 12:37.013
but guaranteed great entertainment:

12:37.089 --> 12:39.683
This is one guy
who truly loves his job:

12:42.461 --> 12:44.361
And if you thought
it couldn't get any better,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.193
we have a dramatic late entrant--

12:46.766 --> 12:48.791
a returning champion
who I'm sure

12:48.868 --> 12:52.964
will add something very
personal to the proceedings:

12:53.038 --> 12:54.062
Seven years ago,

12:54.140 --> 12:56.370
Joshua Harlow took
the Tournament by storm

12:56.442 --> 12:57.807
and retired as a champion:

12:57.877 --> 12:59.572
But this year he's back:

12:59.645 --> 13:02.136
For one reason,
and one reason only--

13:02.948 --> 13:04.176
revenge:

13:04.950 --> 13:06.713
Joshua's wife was brutally murdered

13:06.786 --> 13:08.583
in their Miami home
four months ago,

13:09.455 --> 13:11.150
and the person who killed her

13:11.223 --> 13:13.214
is one of this year's players!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.888
Joshua Harlow is our
favorite at 2 to 1 :

13:17.963 --> 13:20.557
[applause]

13:20.633 --> 13:21.657
Activate tracking devices:

13:21.734 --> 13:23.759
overlaying and synching positions:

13:23.836 --> 13:26.862
- Tracking bugs online:
- Prepare to go hot:

13:26.939 --> 13:28.167
Hotter than me in a swimsuit:

13:29.608 --> 13:31.269
Cue:

13:31.343 --> 13:33.777
As ever, each assassin

13:33.846 --> 13:35.177
is implanted with a tracking device,

13:35.247 --> 13:36.509
so we can find them,

13:36.582 --> 13:38.311
and they can find each other:

13:38.384 --> 13:42.218
But this year we've added
an extra pinch of spice:

13:42.288 --> 13:44.916
If we don't have a winner
within 24 hours,

13:44.990 --> 13:47.083
our contestants will discover

13:47.159 --> 13:48.456
that their tracking device

13:48.527 --> 13:50.927
isn't just a tracking device:

13:51.664 --> 13:54.155
Well, I know you're all very busy men:

13:56.669 --> 13:58.500
30 contestants:::

13:59.505 --> 14:01.439
24 hours:::

14:01.507 --> 14:02.565
one rule--

14:02.641 --> 14:04.666
kill or die:

14:04.743 --> 14:07.940
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets:

14:08.013 --> 14:10.345
The Tournament has begun:

14:10.416 --> 14:13.817
[cheering]

14:20.693 --> 14:22.661
[water running]

14:27.533 --> 14:30.297

14:40.713 --> 14:41.680
[beeping]

15:00.399 --> 15:01.730
Rob:
Suck me sideways:

15:01.800 --> 15:04.325
I would kill
for a piece of that pie:

15:04.403 --> 15:05.631
Yeah, right:

15:05.704 --> 15:08.332
You'd be fucking dead
before you could lick your lips:

15:08.407 --> 15:12.036
Besides, somebody upstairs
has designs on her:

15:12.111 --> 15:13.510
oh, yeah?
Is that so?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.137
Uh-huh:
Yeah, kinda:

15:15.214 --> 15:17.273
They go way back:
He nurtured her or something:

15:17.349 --> 15:18.976
[beeping]

15:19.051 --> 15:20.143
Tech: oh, oh, oh:

15:20.219 --> 15:22.483
All right, it is showtime:

15:22.554 --> 15:24.215
Rob: Holy shit:
Can you do that?

15:24.290 --> 15:25.848
- Wow:
- He just killed an innocent guy!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.085
Tech: Fuck! I love this shit:

15:27.159 --> 15:29.093
- Fuck!
- Keep on him:

15:29.161 --> 15:30.685
I'm locked on him:
Nowhere to hide:

15:30.763 --> 15:32.355
Miss Hunter, it is showtime:

15:32.431 --> 15:34.661
We have Tomko versus Zhen:

15:34.733 --> 15:36.701
That is England v. China!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.259
Good:
Patch it through:

15:38.337 --> 15:40.032
Sir, we're off:

15:40.105 --> 15:42.665
It's Steve Tomko and Lai Lai Zhen:

15:43.776 --> 15:46.609
What the fuck are you up to?

15:47.780 --> 15:48.747
[knock on door]

15:51.283 --> 15:53.308
[beeping]

15:55.955 --> 15:57.115
Who is it?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.052
Room service:

15:59.124 --> 16:00.284
Breakfast, madam:

16:57.116 --> 16:58.583
[grunting]

17:03.689 --> 17:05.486
You like that, bitch?
Huh?

17:17.236 --> 17:18.362
[clicks]

17:22.374 --> 17:25.502
I just want you to know,
after I kill you,

17:25.577 --> 17:27.511
I'm going to fuck you:

17:37.289 --> 17:38.779
[screaming]

17:39.825 --> 17:41.793
[laughing]

17:41.860 --> 17:44.727
Hey, welcome
to the tournament, Rob:

17:53.038 --> 17:55.905
You fucking bitch!

18:20.432 --> 18:23.265
Host:
First blood to Lai Lai Zhen:

18:23.335 --> 18:25.462
[cheers and applause]

18:26.505 --> 18:29.440
Her odds move to 7 to 1 :

18:30.109 --> 18:31.474
Man: Yeah!

18:39.985 --> 18:41.384
Man:
Cleanup crew Delta

18:41.453 --> 18:43.978
to the lvy House Hotel room 107.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.216
Delta:
We're on our way.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.315
Rob:
I still would:

18:47.392 --> 18:48.586
- [alarm beeping]
- Confirm one body...

18:48.660 --> 18:50.560
oh, okay, party time:

18:50.629 --> 18:52.859
We have the Frenchman
Anton Bogart

18:52.931 --> 18:54.831
heading into a cluster

18:54.900 --> 18:56.390
- developing on the high street:
- Shit:

18:56.468 --> 18:58.902
Activating all street security cams:

18:58.971 --> 19:03.169
Picking it up on one,
two, three police cameras:

19:03.242 --> 19:05.904
- The cameras live?
- Cameras are live:

19:05.978 --> 19:07.741
We are in on the Gypsy:

19:49.188 --> 19:50.951
[panting]

19:51.023 --> 19:52.684
[groaning]

20:00.365 --> 20:04.062
[beeping]

20:07.873 --> 20:09.101
Fuck:
The Frenchman's gone cold:

20:09.174 --> 20:11.233
I didn't see a fight:
You see him get killed?

20:11.310 --> 20:12.538
no, I didn't see a fucking fight:

20:12.611 --> 20:13.805
Doing a signal sweep:

20:13.879 --> 20:15.039
Check his body heat sensor now:

20:15.113 --> 20:16.102
I'm on it:

20:25.057 --> 20:26.752
Tech: He's back:
What did you do?

20:26.825 --> 20:28.053
Must've been a blip:

20:28.126 --> 20:31.254
Run a complete diagnostic:
I don't like blips:

20:35.567 --> 20:36.761
Top you off?

20:38.503 --> 20:40.869
- Coffee?
- no:

20:41.206 --> 20:41.900
Top you off?

20:45.911 --> 20:46.878
There you go:

20:53.018 --> 20:55.179
[cell phone rings]

20:55.254 --> 20:57.188
Yes:

20:57.256 --> 20:58.518
No:

20:58.590 --> 20:59.887
okay:

21:35.961 --> 21:37.053
[chokes]

21:37.129 --> 21:38.790
You planning to pay for that?

21:41.466 --> 21:43.593
Yeah: Yes:

21:45.971 --> 21:47.268
Credit card?

21:48.640 --> 21:52.337
Here, Father:
Allow me:

21:53.145 --> 21:54.305
Enjoy your coffee:

21:54.379 --> 21:55.539
Au revoir.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.580
Thank you:

22:20.272 --> 22:22.467
[beeping]

22:50.836 --> 22:52.326
[thuds]

23:40.152 --> 23:41.210
Hello, Todd:

23:42.754 --> 23:43.846
Todd:
Hello, Father:

23:43.922 --> 23:45.685
Priest:
Sorry I haven't been around:

23:45.757 --> 23:47.622
I've been busy:
How's your mom doing?

23:47.692 --> 23:49.819
She died, Father:

23:49.895 --> 23:52.830
I-I'm sorry:

23:52.898 --> 23:54.661
Todd:
She was asking after you:

23:54.733 --> 23:58.260
Is there anything I can do,
like help with the funeral?

23:58.336 --> 24:00.031
That's okay:
I've got it all sorted:

24:11.283 --> 24:12.215
[thuds]

24:12.818 --> 24:14.080
[cracks]

24:15.120 --> 24:16.644
- Rob: oh, fuck:
- What?

24:16.721 --> 24:18.245
I think we have another blip:

24:18.323 --> 24:19.881
Shooter on the rooftop just went cold:

24:19.958 --> 24:20.982
No one near her:

24:36.374 --> 24:38.808
We've got a moving signal
but no Frenchman:

24:38.877 --> 24:40.811
What the hell is going on?

24:40.879 --> 24:42.506
- Come on:
- I'm looking, I'm looking:

24:42.581 --> 24:44.606
I fucking hate blips!

24:46.485 --> 24:49.147
[engine idling]

25:22.854 --> 25:23.946
Hail Mary, full of grace:

25:24.022 --> 25:25.114
The Lord is with thee:

25:25.190 --> 25:26.282
Blessed art thou amongst women,

25:26.358 --> 25:28.121
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus:

25:28.193 --> 25:31.128
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

25:31.196 --> 25:33.664
now and in the hour
of our death, amen:

25:43.542 --> 25:47.239
oh, please,
Blessed Virgin, hear me:

25:50.549 --> 25:52.346
I want to be a good man:

25:55.053 --> 25:57.521
I want to be a strong man:

25:59.958 --> 26:03.018
But I look inside my heart
and there is nothing there:

26:05.397 --> 26:07.024
There's nothing there:

26:08.433 --> 26:11.061
oh, Blessed Virgin,
please give me hope:

26:24.082 --> 26:25.879
I know:

26:33.625 --> 26:34.922
What?

26:34.993 --> 26:36.551
Whatever this is,
please, please:::

26:36.628 --> 26:37.993
What's wrong with you?

26:39.030 --> 26:40.429
What's wrong with me?

26:40.498 --> 26:42.398
Please, hear me--

26:42.467 --> 26:44.298
Why aren't you
defending yourself?

26:44.369 --> 26:45.427
I don't have any money,
please:

26:45.503 --> 26:47.471
- I don't have any money:
- Shut up:

26:47.539 --> 26:49.200
I'm just a--
I'm just a priest:

26:49.274 --> 26:51.174
- Please, please--
- [thuds]

27:20.405 --> 27:22.464
[priest panting]

27:48.500 --> 27:52.095
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

27:52.170 --> 27:53.660
goodbye:

28:11.289 --> 28:13.416
[groaning]

28:36.047 --> 28:37.344
[speaking Russian]

28:38.216 --> 28:40.241
I'm going to enjoy this:

28:58.770 --> 28:59.737
Priest:
Stop!

29:11.316 --> 29:12.374
Stop:

29:13.118 --> 29:14.142
Stop!

29:17.422 --> 29:20.516
Please, don't struggle:

29:20.592 --> 29:23.789
So much easier
when they don't struggle:

29:23.862 --> 29:25.193
Priest:
What are you doing?

29:25.263 --> 29:26.753
Just let her go!

29:26.831 --> 29:28.264
I've got a gun!

29:28.333 --> 29:30.301
I've got a gun and I'll use it:

29:43.314 --> 29:44.838
- [cracks]
- Aah!

29:57.028 --> 29:58.188
oh:::

30:17.615 --> 30:19.412
Don't move:

30:19.484 --> 30:20.576
or what?

30:20.652 --> 30:24.247
Just-- just stay right there:

30:24.322 --> 30:25.619
Stay back!

30:28.159 --> 30:29.183
[clicks]

30:32.163 --> 30:33.391
You need one in the chamber:

30:37.669 --> 30:39.534
- Who are you?
- I'm a priest!

30:39.604 --> 30:42.095
If you lie to me,
I break your neck:

30:42.173 --> 30:43.697
I'm not:
I'm not!

30:43.775 --> 30:45.936
Where are your weapons?
Who do you work for?

30:46.010 --> 30:47.568
Where do you receive
your orders from?

30:47.645 --> 30:48.612
Rome!

30:51.115 --> 30:52.673
No scar:

30:52.750 --> 30:54.411
I don't know
what you're talking about:

30:55.453 --> 30:56.852
[beeping]

30:59.190 --> 31:00.487
You're bleeping:

31:06.030 --> 31:08.999
You really don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

31:10.635 --> 31:13.069
You really are a priest:

31:14.205 --> 31:15.729
Father Macavoy:

31:17.976 --> 31:21.309
This is--
was my church:

31:22.380 --> 31:26.407
Well, Father,
welcome to the Tournament:

31:28.219 --> 31:29.618
Thank you:

31:29.687 --> 31:30.889
[cheers and applause]

31:30.889 --> 31:32.880
[cheers and applause]

31:37.061 --> 31:38.153
They found the blip:

31:38.229 --> 31:39.161
What is it?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.663
It's our Frenchman:

31:40.732 --> 31:42.791
- Anton Bogart?
- It seems he managed

31:42.867 --> 31:44.334
to cut out his tracking device,

31:44.402 --> 31:46.461
and it's ended up inside that priest:

31:46.537 --> 31:47.834
I see:

31:47.906 --> 31:49.669
We now have one of our favorites

31:49.741 --> 31:52.107
running around virtually invisible?

31:52.176 --> 31:54.667
I'm sorry:
What shall I tell them to do?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.839
I suggest you shorten his odds

31:56.915 --> 31:58.507
and follow him:

31:58.583 --> 31:59.550
Yes, sir:

32:00.785 --> 32:03.345
Tech: okay, maintain
visual contact with Bogart:

32:03.421 --> 32:05.685
Don't lose sight of that
slippery little bastard:

32:05.757 --> 32:09.818
Tracking manually:
Damn, Bogart's quick:

32:09.894 --> 32:11.987
Man:
Go to camera two. Quick, go.

32:12.063 --> 32:13.291
Just got to reconfigure:

32:13.364 --> 32:15.355
Give me a second:

32:15.433 --> 32:16.730
[alarm beeping]

32:17.802 --> 32:19.861
- Holy shit:
- What now?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.371
- It's him:
- You sure?

32:21.439 --> 32:23.373
oh, there are gonna be fireworks:

32:23.441 --> 32:25.705
All right, Miss Hunter,
we have Harlow:

32:25.777 --> 32:27.574
We have Harlow for you.

32:27.645 --> 32:30.409
May I have your attention?

32:31.616 --> 32:34.380
You wanted
the greatest show on Earth:

32:34.452 --> 32:36.215
out for revenge,

32:36.287 --> 32:39.188
the greatest assassin of our time:

32:48.132 --> 32:49.531
[man panting]

32:53.938 --> 32:57.032
[beeping]

33:01.479 --> 33:03.913
Joshua:
Cut the shit, Eddy:

33:03.982 --> 33:07.076
oh, shit:

33:07.151 --> 33:10.450
- What are you doing here?
- I need information:

33:10.521 --> 33:12.421
What have you heard?

33:12.490 --> 33:15.152
I heard someone
came for you:

33:15.226 --> 33:17.456
[tires screech]

33:17.528 --> 33:19.393
Eddy:
I heard it got a bit messy:

33:24.335 --> 33:26.200
And I heard about your wife:

33:26.270 --> 33:28.397
Joshua:
What did you hear? Who told you?

33:28.473 --> 33:31.271
The crazy American kid, Miles:

33:31.342 --> 33:32.604
He's your one:

33:32.677 --> 33:35.840
Miles Slade, the finger guy?

33:35.913 --> 33:37.608
Uh-huh:

33:37.682 --> 33:40.014
- Thanks:
- You're welcome:

33:44.689 --> 33:46.884
Um:::

33:46.958 --> 33:49.518
[car alarms blaring]

33:56.367 --> 33:57.299
Man:
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

33:57.368 --> 34:00.030

34:00.104 --> 34:02.129
[crunches]

34:02.206 --> 34:03.969
Well, that's one more
for the trophy cabinet,

34:04.042 --> 34:06.306
thank you very much:

34:06.377 --> 34:09.107
Uh-huh:

34:10.547 --> 34:12.914
Hey, boy!
[whistles]

34:12.984 --> 34:13.973
Come here, little fella:

34:14.052 --> 34:15.882
Hey, there's a good boy:

34:15.953 --> 34:19.320
There's a good dog:
Yeah, that's a good dog:

34:19.389 --> 34:20.982
That's a good dog:

34:21.059 --> 34:24.085
Hey, what is this?

34:24.161 --> 34:25.857
What is that, huh?

34:25.929 --> 34:28.659
What is it?
Here you go:

34:28.733 --> 34:30.199
- [gunshot]
- [dog squeals]

34:32.937 --> 34:34.029
[yawns]

34:34.105 --> 34:37.632
Rob:
That guy is fucked up:

34:42.080 --> 34:43.513
[sighs]

34:50.755 --> 34:51.687
[whistles]

34:51.755 --> 34:53.155
See you later, boy:

35:01.933 --> 35:05.369
Tech:
okay, just take it back a little:

35:05.436 --> 35:06.994
Rob:
Playing out to one:

35:09.373 --> 35:12.171
Rob:
Jeez, who steals a finger?

35:12.243 --> 35:13.938
oh, yeah:

35:14.011 --> 35:16.104
- [phone ringing]
- oh, fuck:

35:16.180 --> 35:18.546
That's the emergency line:
What do I do?

35:18.616 --> 35:20.049
Answer it:

35:20.118 --> 35:22.552
[humming]

35:22.620 --> 35:23.917
Hello:

35:26.457 --> 35:29.085
Yeah, hold on:
I'll just put you through:

35:31.963 --> 35:34.898
Just spoke to Lai Lai Zhen:

35:34.966 --> 35:37.901
You tell her you wanted
to eat her pie?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.163
[humming]

35:39.237 --> 35:40.898
- Excuse me, Senator:
- All right:

35:40.972 --> 35:42.564
It's Lai Lai:

35:42.974 --> 35:44.737
Make sure that redneck
settles his marker

35:44.809 --> 35:46.777
before he has another coronary:

35:49.113 --> 35:49.807
Speak:

35:49.881 --> 35:51.974
Lai Lai:
We have a situation with a civilian.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.778
Macavoy:
Who are you talking to, the police?

35:53.851 --> 35:56.251
Quiet:
I know you can see what's going on:

35:56.320 --> 35:58.254
Host:
You know the rules, Lai Lai.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.187
It's kill or be killed.

36:00.258 --> 36:02.158
You're like a child
running back to Daddy

36:02.226 --> 36:04.091
telling me how
the big boy stole your ball:

36:04.162 --> 36:07.029
You're on the battlefield.
There is no going back.

36:07.098 --> 36:10.363
And he's just one of those famous
innocent bystanders you hear about:

36:10.434 --> 36:12.459
- Let me speak to him:
- no, stop it:

36:12.537 --> 36:14.334
- This is Father Macavoy:
- I'll kill you myself:

36:14.405 --> 36:17.101
- Let me speak to him:
- It's not right: He's just a priest:

36:17.175 --> 36:20.110
Host:
Personally, I find it kind of apt.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.942
Back in the day we used to throw
Christians to the lions.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.847
Seems that history
is repeating itself.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.111
Carry him or kill him,

36:27.185 --> 36:29.676
but don't call back:

36:32.023 --> 36:34.651
What's happened?
Are the police coming?

36:35.693 --> 36:36.625
not really:

36:36.694 --> 36:38.559
[car rewing]

36:40.064 --> 36:41.224
Move!

37:13.564 --> 37:15.930
We have to get out of here now:

37:16.000 --> 37:17.490
Move it!

37:17.568 --> 37:20.002
Woman:
oh, God!

37:20.071 --> 37:22.335
[woman weeping]

37:22.406 --> 37:24.306
Someone help me!

37:27.078 --> 37:29.808
- [pounding]
- Please, help! God!

37:30.581 --> 37:31.775
[sobbing]

37:36.320 --> 37:37.844
Macavoy:
It's stuck:

37:39.023 --> 37:41.082
Woman:
Help me with the seatbelt:

37:42.260 --> 37:44.592
- It's jammed:
- Don't let me die!

37:46.597 --> 37:47.894
Macavoy:
Come here: Come here:

37:50.601 --> 37:52.466
Wrong day to be
a good Samaritan:

37:56.574 --> 37:59.042
When I say "move it",
move it!

37:59.110 --> 38:00.634
- Come on!
- What's going on?

38:00.711 --> 38:03.009
You've got a bug inside you:
They think you're a hitter:

38:03.080 --> 38:05.048
This is a competition for assassins:

38:05.116 --> 38:06.378
That last man standing wins:

38:06.450 --> 38:08.077
A game where people
kill each other?

38:08.152 --> 38:10.211
Yes, we have to get
the tracker out of you,

38:10.288 --> 38:12.256
otherwise you're a target:

38:12.323 --> 38:14.416
Why don't we go to the police?

38:14.492 --> 38:15.754
Eh? You and l:

38:15.826 --> 38:17.623
You acted in self-defense:
I'll speak for you:

38:17.695 --> 38:19.890
Is it my accent?
Do I stutter? Is that it?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.454
The people who run this,

38:21.532 --> 38:23.397
they are more powerful
than the police:

38:23.467 --> 38:25.458
- Man: Somebody:::
- They will get you anywhere:

38:25.536 --> 38:27.561
- :::do something!
- But the bodies:::

38:27.638 --> 38:28.662
people will see the bodies:

38:28.739 --> 38:30.331
There will be an explanation:

38:30.408 --> 38:33.002
It won't be the truth,
but it will be what people will buy:

38:33.077 --> 38:35.068
A madman with a gun,
a terrorist attack,

38:35.146 --> 38:36.773
a natural disaster,
a car crash:

38:36.847 --> 38:38.576
That's how the Tournament
remains a secret!

38:38.649 --> 38:40.241
It's insane:

38:40.318 --> 38:42.411
Don't you watch TV, Father?

38:42.486 --> 38:44.454
The whole world is insane:

38:48.492 --> 38:50.619
now move it!
Come on!

38:50.695 --> 38:50.795
[cheering]

38:50.795 --> 38:53.662
[cheering]

38:55.733 --> 38:57.064
Tech: Sir.

38:57.134 --> 38:58.431
Sir, can we just reconfirm?

38:58.502 --> 39:00.231
You want to make
the priest a player?

39:00.304 --> 39:01.771
You want him on the system?

39:01.839 --> 39:03.932
Was I unclear, Mr: Hamilton?

39:04.008 --> 39:08.104
no: no, sir:
It's ready: It's ready:

39:08.179 --> 39:10.875
- This is bullshit:
- Shut up and do it:

39:17.521 --> 39:20.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
a man of the cloth

39:20.324 --> 39:21.723
has stepped out
from the sidelines:

39:21.792 --> 39:24.625
If any of you good people
would like to take a long shot

39:24.695 --> 39:26.356
on a man with a dog collar,

39:26.430 --> 39:28.261
we'll take that action:

39:28.332 --> 39:29.765
[laughter, applause]

39:39.310 --> 39:41.301
[sirens]

39:41.379 --> 39:43.176
Lai Lai:
Will you hurry up?

39:43.714 --> 39:45.306
Macavoy:
It's not coming up:

39:45.383 --> 39:47.647
How do you know
I've even swallowed this thing?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.310
How else could it
be inside you?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.945
[gagging]

39:55.893 --> 39:57.520
Fuck! Fuck!

39:58.729 --> 40:00.356
Everybody thinks I'm an assassin!

40:00.931 --> 40:02.057
Everybody wants me dead!

40:02.133 --> 40:03.998
- Yes:
- oh, fuck!

40:04.068 --> 40:06.263
I don't wanna die:

40:09.073 --> 40:11.132
- It's okay:
- I don't wanna die:

40:12.076 --> 40:13.202
I don't wanna die:

40:14.278 --> 40:17.213
- I don't know how to cope with this:
- You'll be okay:

40:17.281 --> 40:19.909
[sirens approaching]

40:19.984 --> 40:21.884
Trust me:

40:21.952 --> 40:23.715
okay:

40:26.357 --> 40:28.587
oh, thank God:
Thank God:

40:33.597 --> 40:35.827
oh, officer,
thank goodness you're here:

40:37.234 --> 40:39.293
- nice outfit, Father:
- [high-pitched whine]

40:41.539 --> 40:42.631
Get down!

40:47.812 --> 40:48.779
Come on!

40:52.283 --> 40:53.011
What's happening?

40:53.083 --> 40:56.575
I'm not sure,
but we have to get out of here now:

40:57.955 --> 40:59.252
Macavoy:
A policeman's been killed:

40:59.323 --> 41:01.848
- He's a player:
- A player?

41:01.926 --> 41:04.224
Why would anybody want
to take part in this madness?

41:04.295 --> 41:07.287
Cash prize, revenge,
title, excitement:

41:07.364 --> 41:09.195
So what's your reason?

41:30.020 --> 41:32.386
Macavoy:
I've seen him before:

41:32.456 --> 41:34.447
- In the cafe this morning:
- Are you sure?

41:34.525 --> 41:36.720
- Positive:
- He cut it out:

41:56.080 --> 41:57.069
Hold on!

42:41.559 --> 42:42.617
Fuck:

43:12.590 --> 43:15.218
Miles:
Whoo! Here we go:

43:19.096 --> 43:20.859
[chuckles]

43:20.931 --> 43:24.128
Yeah: Hi, ladies!

43:32.710 --> 43:34.473
[thunder rumbling]

43:38.182 --> 43:40.047
[thunder clap]

44:05.009 --> 44:06.340
Hurry back:

44:10.314 --> 44:11.872
I love you, baby:

44:13.117 --> 44:14.311
Enjoy your life together:

44:22.459 --> 44:23.426
Where were you?

44:24.695 --> 44:28.187
- [phone ringing]
- [answering machine beeps]

44:28.265 --> 44:30.529
Host on speaker:
Joshua,

44:30.601 --> 44:33.695
I'm deeply sorry about your loss,

44:33.771 --> 44:35.261
but I may have some information

44:35.339 --> 44:37.830
about the person
that came after you.

44:37.908 --> 44:40.001
I may know where
you can find them.

44:54.258 --> 44:54.358
[thunder clap]

44:54.358 --> 44:56.690
[thunder clap]

44:56.760 --> 45:01.288
[loud bass echoing]

45:01.365 --> 45:04.334
[hip hop music playing]

45:19.550 --> 45:20.949
Rob:
oh, shit:

45:21.018 --> 45:22.952
We got another one
of those cluster things:

45:23.020 --> 45:24.044
Hamilton:
Jesus fucking Christ:

45:24.121 --> 45:26.715
That's not a cluster:
That is a war zone:

45:26.790 --> 45:28.849
Angel's titty bar?
Are you kidding me?

45:28.926 --> 45:30.325
There's nine shooters in there:

45:30.394 --> 45:31.656
Why aren't they
attacking each other?

45:31.729 --> 45:33.162
Probably so many people
in the place

45:33.230 --> 45:34.663
they don't know who is who:

45:34.732 --> 45:36.825
All right, we got ourselves
a situation here:

45:36.900 --> 45:39.664
We have nine players
in one location:

45:39.737 --> 45:43.298
Repeat, nine players
in one shithole location:

45:43.373 --> 45:46.069
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:46.143 --> 45:49.010
we have a bloodbath
about to take place:

45:49.079 --> 45:50.068
[crowd cheers]

45:50.147 --> 45:53.207
[hip hop music playing]

46:19.076 --> 46:21.601
- [music stops]
- [screaming]

46:32.890 --> 46:34.414
Miles:
Come on, bitches!

46:37.161 --> 46:38.321
Yeah!

46:39.396 --> 46:40.658
Fuck yeah!

46:44.902 --> 46:45.926
Come on, boys!

46:46.003 --> 46:46.970
Whoo-hoo!

46:51.775 --> 46:52.742
Yeah!

46:53.811 --> 46:55.210
no, you don't!

46:56.380 --> 46:57.870
[Miles laughing]

47:02.586 --> 47:03.848
I see you, bud!

47:03.921 --> 47:05.115
[woman whimpering]

47:05.189 --> 47:07.123
Thanks, sweetheart:

47:09.860 --> 47:12.090
Tindillini and Mitre out:

47:12.162 --> 47:15.359
They're going down fast:
Still taking bets:

47:21.305 --> 47:22.738
Miles:
Come on, boys!

47:25.342 --> 47:26.468
Whoo-hoo!

47:40.791 --> 47:41.951
Yeah!

47:44.628 --> 47:45.890
[laughing]

47:45.963 --> 47:48.488
You fucking son of a bitch:

47:55.172 --> 47:56.161
Whoo!

47:56.240 --> 47:58.071
- Ho, ho, ho!
- This is fucked up:

47:58.141 --> 47:59.233
oh!

47:59.309 --> 48:01.743
That's Van de Ven out of the game:

48:07.050 --> 48:09.348
- [man panting]
- Miles: Where you at, boys?

48:17.861 --> 48:18.850
[shouts]

48:22.232 --> 48:23.927
Aah!

48:28.238 --> 48:30.399
Aah!

48:30.474 --> 48:32.101
Miles:
Bring it on!

48:35.379 --> 48:36.971
[groans]

48:42.619 --> 48:44.712
[whimpering]

49:40.544 --> 49:43.877
Yeah!
Fuck, yeah!

49:43.947 --> 49:46.415
Whoo-whoo!
Whoo!

49:46.483 --> 49:47.677
Was it you, Miles?

49:47.751 --> 49:49.150
Did you come after me?

49:49.219 --> 49:51.449
- Stay still, honey:
- Did you murder my wife?

49:51.521 --> 49:53.113
What the fuck you talking about?

49:53.190 --> 49:55.055
Aah!

49:55.125 --> 49:56.422
[both screaming]

50:04.001 --> 50:05.298
no, you don't, honey:

50:10.507 --> 50:11.997
Good night, sugar:

50:24.921 --> 50:27.947
Dispatcher:
We're experiencing problems
with transmitting.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.152
All units,
we have reports of gunfire...

50:32.062 --> 50:33.825
Man on radio:
Sorry, we're completely swamped here.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.496
Man #2 on radio:
What the hell's going on today?

50:39.169 --> 50:40.636
[radio chatter continues]

50:40.704 --> 50:42.433
God, I need a drink:

50:44.374 --> 50:46.569
You drink too much

50:46.643 --> 50:49.305
and your eyes give you away:

50:49.379 --> 50:51.574
You damage your liver:

50:51.648 --> 50:54.082
That's just perfect:
That's just exactly what I need,

50:54.151 --> 50:56.711
health advice from a hit man:

50:59.289 --> 51:01.985
What are we going to do?

51:02.059 --> 51:04.619
We have to wait until it passes
through your system:

51:04.694 --> 51:07.993
The further out of town we go,
the less accurate the tracker:

51:08.065 --> 51:09.623
It will buy us some time:

51:09.699 --> 51:12.634
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

51:12.702 --> 51:14.101
Why are you here?

51:14.171 --> 51:15.331
Why are you playing?

51:15.405 --> 51:18.499
Why all the questions?

51:18.575 --> 51:20.600
Why do you drink so much?

51:20.677 --> 51:24.306
Why were you sobbing
like a child this morning?

51:28.085 --> 51:30.576
Because I'm lost:

51:31.788 --> 51:34.188
You're lost?

51:34.257 --> 51:35.690
Try to be me:

51:37.727 --> 51:40.423
It must be tough playing God
with people's lives:

51:41.098 --> 51:42.497
I don't play God:

51:43.600 --> 51:45.761
If I don't do it,
somebody else will:

51:45.836 --> 51:49.533
It's just a job:
nothing more:

51:49.606 --> 51:50.698
I don't believe you:

51:51.975 --> 51:53.704
otherwise,
why didn't you just kill me?

51:56.279 --> 51:58.076
I don't kill the innocent:

52:04.121 --> 52:05.748
I'm so happy:

52:06.923 --> 52:10.484
Did you feel that?

52:12.662 --> 52:14.061
Please!

52:15.699 --> 52:17.257
Where were you?

52:22.706 --> 52:25.539
[gasps]

52:26.143 --> 52:27.770
Miles:
Can you hold that for me, buddy?

52:27.844 --> 52:30.005
Huh: Howdy:

52:30.080 --> 52:32.548
[Miles laughs]

52:36.887 --> 52:37.854
Look at you:

52:39.623 --> 52:42.421
Joshua Harlow,

52:42.492 --> 52:44.221
greatest assassin there ever was:

52:45.662 --> 52:47.152
Well, I shit ya,

52:47.230 --> 52:49.858
you're well past your best, ain't ya?

52:49.933 --> 52:52.697
But, hey, look at the bright side--

52:52.769 --> 52:56.227
at least you fell at the hands
of this year's champion:

52:56.306 --> 52:58.365
[Miles laughing]

53:01.378 --> 53:03.107
Look at what I did to that guy:

53:03.180 --> 53:05.944
What the fuck was I thinking?

53:06.016 --> 53:08.780
Jesus, Miles,
you're a fucking maniac:

53:08.852 --> 53:10.149
Thanks:

53:15.358 --> 53:18.122
Have a drink, legend:

53:18.195 --> 53:20.390
Trying to quit:

53:21.198 --> 53:21.960
[groans]

53:22.032 --> 53:24.125
Just to be clear, old-timer,

53:24.201 --> 53:26.169
these are the last few
moments of your life

53:26.236 --> 53:27.965
you're experiencing right now:

53:28.038 --> 53:31.303
You might as well
have a drink with me:

53:31.374 --> 53:33.205
Maybe later:

53:36.546 --> 53:38.070
Suit yourself, superstar:

53:39.716 --> 53:40.944
Go on, now, tell me:::

53:42.385 --> 53:43.875
how many kills?

53:45.722 --> 53:47.485
See, I love killing:

53:47.557 --> 53:48.524
Just the smell of it:

53:49.226 --> 53:50.386
Why Mary?

53:52.696 --> 53:53.628
Mary?

53:53.697 --> 53:55.062
Yeah:

53:55.131 --> 53:57.998
Mary who?
I killed a fucking million Marys:

53:58.068 --> 53:59.501
You know who:

53:59.569 --> 54:01.662
Miami, four months ago:

54:01.738 --> 54:02.864
I wasn't home:

54:02.939 --> 54:05.407
It was me you wanted:
Why did you kill her?

54:05.475 --> 54:07.909
[laughing]

54:10.247 --> 54:12.181
[man coughing]

54:14.251 --> 54:15.343
[giggles]

54:15.418 --> 54:16.817
Give me a second:

54:16.886 --> 54:18.945
Hey, man, let me help you:

54:23.994 --> 54:24.961
[grunts]

54:28.265 --> 54:29.732
[thuds]

54:31.768 --> 54:33.235
Whoa:

54:35.238 --> 54:37.729
That's some nasty shit:

54:39.743 --> 54:40.710
Now where were we?

54:42.145 --> 54:43.134
My wife:

54:43.213 --> 54:45.010
Yeah: Why weren't you there?

54:46.116 --> 54:48.175
You left her all alone:

54:48.251 --> 54:50.242
If I were you:::

54:53.590 --> 54:54.648
I'd blame myself:

54:55.692 --> 54:57.319
[chuckles]

54:59.629 --> 55:00.721
Bad news, superstar:

55:00.797 --> 55:03.595
This is really going to fuck you off:

55:10.473 --> 55:11.770
It wasn't me:

55:13.810 --> 55:15.607
Don't lie to me, kid:

55:17.981 --> 55:20.779
I am not:::

55:23.653 --> 55:24.745
- a kid!
- [slices]

55:24.821 --> 55:25.810
[screaming]

55:25.889 --> 55:28.289
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

55:31.828 --> 55:34.558
I got me a $10 million trigger finger:

55:35.165 --> 55:36.826
That's as close as you'll ever come,

55:36.900 --> 55:39.027
you fucking amateur:

55:39.102 --> 55:41.935
Here, let me help you with that:

55:42.005 --> 55:43.802
- [sizzling]
- [groans]

55:44.507 --> 55:45.769
I really wish it was me:

55:45.842 --> 55:49.608
Shit, I really do:

55:49.679 --> 55:52.204
But I wouldn't go take credit
for other people's work:

55:53.016 --> 55:55.007
That'd just be wrong:

55:56.152 --> 55:58.643
Don't you pass out on me, legend:

56:00.690 --> 56:02.885
I'm going to tell you
who killed your wife:

56:05.362 --> 56:08.160
It gives me great pleasure

56:08.231 --> 56:09.721
to know:::

56:09.799 --> 56:11.528
that you know who did it

56:11.601 --> 56:14.832
and that you can't do
a fucking thing about it:

56:16.706 --> 56:18.936
Lai Lai Zhen came after you:

56:19.008 --> 56:21.169
[gasps]

56:21.244 --> 56:22.176
Lai Lai Zhen:

56:22.245 --> 56:25.510
Heh:
She killed your wife:

56:27.417 --> 56:29.408
You're a liar:

56:30.053 --> 56:31.179
Am l?

56:32.889 --> 56:35.824
I think I'll have that drink now:

56:35.892 --> 56:37.519
That's the spirit:

56:39.229 --> 56:41.026
Toast the new champion:

56:48.738 --> 56:50.365
I think we're done here:

56:56.346 --> 56:57.677
Aah!

56:57.747 --> 57:01.148
[screaming]

57:19.235 --> 57:21.863
[beeping]

57:32.182 --> 57:34.343
[beeps]

57:42.859 --> 57:47.125
- [soft music playing]
- [engine starts]

57:55.305 --> 57:58.206
Every time

57:58.274 --> 58:02.904
We say goodbye

58:02.979 --> 58:07.575
I die a little

58:07.650 --> 58:14.419
Every time we say goodbye

58:14.491 --> 58:19.428
I wonder why a little

58:19.496 --> 58:24.092
Why the gods above me

58:24.167 --> 58:29.764
Who must be in the know

58:31.508 --> 58:35.945
Think so little of me

58:36.012 --> 58:41.450
They allow you to go?

58:43.086 --> 58:46.453
When you're near

58:46.523 --> 58:50.960
There's such an air

58:51.027 --> 58:55.623
of spring about it

58:55.698 --> 59:02.797
I can hear a lark somewhere

59:02.872 --> 59:07.900
Begin to sing about it

59:07.977 --> 59:12.311
There's no love song finer

59:12.382 --> 59:16.148
But how strange the change

59:16.219 --> 59:19.484
From major to minor

59:19.556 --> 59:31.400
Every time we say goodbye

59:43.413 --> 59:44.903
[gasps]

59:45.582 --> 59:46.549
You okay?

59:47.917 --> 59:50.909
oh, no:
For a minute there

59:50.987 --> 59:53.080
I thought it was
all just a bad dream:

59:53.156 --> 59:54.589
You'll be okay:

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.298
- [door thuds]
- oh:

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.985
[groans]

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:38.061
oh, please:

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:42.070
Please, God,
help me through this:

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:47.132
Please give me
some strength because--

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.178
- because I need a drink!
- [thuds]

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:50.940
[gasps]

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.926
[door opens, closes]

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.291
Sorry, I was--

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.329
[gasps]

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:13.026
Bless me, Father, I have sinned:

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.332
Aah!

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.274
Stakes are high,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.211
a favorite will fall:

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.120
[hard rock playing
on headphones]

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.254
[shouting]

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:37.723
[hard rock continuing]

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.463
You're lucky I got to you
before Joshua did:

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.168
He's pretty pissed you killed his wife:

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.516
[groaning]

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.822
no, no:

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.484
- [grunts]
- Wait, wait:

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.290
Please, please stop:

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.425
[whimpers]

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.694
Man:
Finish the fucker!

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:21.100
[crowd jeering]

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.194
You:::

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:23.329
Don't do it!

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.432
Please!
I'm sorry:

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.999
[whimpering]

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:29.567
Don't do it:
Don't do it:

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:33.716
[microwave bell rings]

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.554
Miles:
Don't:::

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.961
I'm sorry:

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.564
[Miles sobbing]

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.102
[crowd jeering,
laughing]

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.872
Man:
Pull the fucking trigger!

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.308
Man on radio:
Let's get as close as we can.

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.349
[phone ringing]

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.043
Keep him locked.
We gotta wait.

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:10.779
He said what?

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.079
It's the right thing:

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.318
[electronic beeping]

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.019
[whimpering]

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:21.154
What is it?

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.424
What is it?

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.591
[beeping faster]

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.725
No!

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.394
What is it?

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.370
Aah!

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.442
[telephone rings]

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.779
[ringing continues]

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.621
[ringing]

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.302
Hello?
Mill's service station:

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.602
It's, um--

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.141
it's for you:

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:13.781
Hello?

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.511
Father Macavoy,

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:17.780
we haven't met,

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.789
but I feel I know you intimately:

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.792
So you're the sick fucker
that's running all this, are ya?

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.125
Such profanity
from a man of the cloth:

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.458
[crowd chuckles]

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.623
now I suggest you listen to me

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.328
very, very carefully:

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.461
Since you deemed it
necessary to interrupt

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.063
what could have been
a spectacular kill,

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.974
I feel I should clarify the rules a little.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.808
There's a time limit
you really should take note of.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.475
Time limit?
What are you talking about?

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.983
It's very simple.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:52.316
You need to start killing
if you want to stay alive.

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.753
I'm not going to kill anyone:

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.814
We shall wait and see:

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.883
It will be your faith

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.428
against your desire to live:

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.987
That device inside you
is so much more than a tracker,

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.555
as you've just witnessed:

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:07.330
There's only four hours
left of the game, Father.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.667
If there's more than
one player still alive

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.673
when the clock hits zero,

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.504
everyone will meet
the same fate

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.170
as your American friend.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:19.373
So let's see if you have any real guts:

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.547
It's kill or be killed:

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:25.018
Four hours, Father,

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.749
and the clock is ticking:

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.290
[laughing]

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:31.223
[dial tone]

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.459
Thank you:

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:39.859
[laughs]

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:43.303
Well, that's perfect:

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:44.573
Hamilton: Let's bring a replay
of that up on one:

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.507
Hamilton: Let's bring a replay
of that up on one:

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:48.543
Rob: Jesus:

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.135
We have to do that to all of them

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.201
if the time runs out?

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.544
no, it takes them out automatically:

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.208
What's the priest doing?

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:58.378
If the sat imagery is correct,

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:01.617
he is trying to sort his shit out:

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.716
Lai Lai:
Anything yet?

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.557
Macavoy:
nothing's happening: I'm too tense:

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.223
It's got to come out
one end or the other:

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.424
[sighs]

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.558
Can you not wait outside?

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:16.071
I'm staying put:
now concentrate:

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:17.298
You're putting me off:

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.742
Can you whistle or something?

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.480
okay, who's Joshua's wife?

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.350
It doesn't matter:

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:34.389
okay:

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.322
I thought the way you reacted
when you heard--

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.622
Will you just leave it alone?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.964
Bit of a confession
in here, really, eh?

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.106
Confession can be incredibly hard:

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:58.613
It's painful to admit our sins

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:02.014
and trust ourselves in God's care:

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:06.988
But it helps:

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.120
It helps:::

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.662
sometimes:

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.691
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.327
Hmm?

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.166
What's it got to do
with Joshua's wife?

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:39.821
The last thing you see
in a target's eyes:::

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.016
is understanding:

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.928
Somewhere,
deep inside of them,

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.225
they've been expecting it:

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:55.927
Mary Harlow didn't have that look:

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:00.534
She just stared at me,

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.201
Iike you did this morning--

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:08.448
petrified, scared:::

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.352
bewildered:

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.660
I saw in her eyes

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.423
that something was wrong:

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.800
Please!

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.661
My instincts told me to stop:

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.197
Please!

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.139
But I pulled the trigger anyway:

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:41.715
[Lai Lai crying]

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:44.218
I didn't know it until afterwards,

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.448
but she was pregnant:

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:53.085
It's haunted me ever since:

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.524
That's why I have
to win this tournament:::

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.465
so I can get enough
money to vanish:

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.603
And if I don't win:::

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.604
then I get what's coming:

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.924
okay, Miss Hunter,
the final few players

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.429
seem to be converging
on the motorway:

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.828
We got Harlow on the move,

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.594
we're tracking Bogart nearby,

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.430
and the long shot, Topuzov,
is closing in fast:

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:38.200
Lai Lai Zhen and the priest
are sitting ducks:

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.938
[door opens]

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:51.711
We have to get out of here now:

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.813
- I haven't--
- Now:

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.414
okay:

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.562
Shit:

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.339
Quick, get to the car:

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.142
Shit:

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.676
[horn honks]

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:31.852
oh, shit:

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.577
[passengers shouting]

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.172
[car crashing]

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.885
Come on!

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:04.923
What's going on?

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.457
- I'm taking your bus:
- What?

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:14.126
I'm taking your bus:

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:15.699
Drive:

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:19.202
- I can't drive a bus:
- Learn fast!

They're coming up on the Frenchman:

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.723
How is he gonna get in on the action?

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.928
Lai Lai!
Come and see this:

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.592

Jeez, they're going way too fast:

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.012
They're out of control:

That guy's got a ticket:

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.284
Maybe not:

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.827

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:10.684
What have I done?

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.432
You saved me:

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.326
I'm gonna be sick:

okay, that is confirmed, sir:

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:47.923
Bogart is down and the priest
has officially left the game:

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.556

what are you doing still here?

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:47.484
I cannot protect you anymore:

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:48.818
Please go:

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:53.118
I don't wanna go:

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:55.163
Why not?

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.730
You didn't abandon me,

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.735
so I'm not going
to abandon you, yes?

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:15.515
We should go:

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:18.712
Come on:

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:32.358
only five minutes remaining,
ladies and gentlemen:

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.696
Let me remind you,

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.329
if we don't have a winner
when the time runs out,

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:39.237
we will pay out on the current favorite,

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:54.379
Lai Lai:
No cameras:

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:58.449
They cannot see us in here:

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.324
What did you say?

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.327
There are no cameras in there:

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:03.887
- What about satellite?
- They're indoors:

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.227
Did I speak to you?

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.495
There are 30 people in there
who paid $10 million:

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:08.866
We're in the final few minutes:

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.029
I want everything and anything

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.572
pointed at that fucking church!

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.437
Wow, that really helps:

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:14.736
[alarm beeping]

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.004
okay, okay:

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:21.505
If we can't show what,
we can at least show where:

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.283
Rob:
We'll give 'em something to watch:

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.957
You have to get to a hospital:

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.961
I want you to pray with me:

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.468
of course:

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.628
You said your prayers?

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.729
I hope you said goodbye:

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:20.604
Please, this is God's house:

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:21.801
no killing in God's house:

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:26.143
God?
Why, Lai Lai?

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:27.806
Did someone send you,

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.647
or was it personal?

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.914
- Just kill me:
- no, no, no:

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.512
Get it over with:

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.890
Why?

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.588
Why'd you come after me?

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.528
Why'd you come after me?

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:47.193
I didn't come after you:

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.829
What?

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:53.602
I wasn't there for you:
I was there for her:

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.371
The contract was on your wife:

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:08.688
Why?

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:11.351
Why would anyone
want to kill Mary? Why?

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.394
I don't know why:

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.861
We never know why:

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.526
Please, please:
Joshua, please:

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.932
She's not to blame:

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:22.731
She's not to blame for any of this:

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:25.295
She's a device, like a tool:

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:27.671
- She didn't want to kill your wife:
- no, shut up!

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.903
- She didn't want to kill--
- Shut up!

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.036

Mary was my life:

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.919
Mary was my life!
Who hired you?

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:41.149
She was your life:
She was your life:

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.417
Don't dishonor her now with death:

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:44.981
Who hired you?

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.392
- You're dishonoring her with death!
- Shut up!

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:49.555
Who hired you?

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:52.395
You know who hired me:

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:58.834
Joshua, what would Mary do?

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.204
What would Mary have you do?

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:06.175

[cheers and applause]

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:33.097
Host:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:35.329
I want to present to you

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:38.497
the two-time winner
of the Tournament:

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.007
Please be upstanding

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:44.273
for the greatest assassin
of our time!

Joshua:

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.565
I know everything:

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.406
Why?

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.383
What?

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:25.885
I put on a good show, didn't l?

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:29.219
You can keep all this money that I won,

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:32.885
if you just tell me
why you murdered my wife:

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.128
You're delirious, Joshua:

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:39.792
I'm dying, but you're sweating:

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:42.530
now why is that?

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:46.734
What's the matter,
you afraid to admit it?

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.332
Come on:

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.934
Come on, we're all killers here!

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:52.738
You need a doctor:

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.074
You're being absurd:

01:25:55.150 --> 01:26:00.452
Why? Why did you murder my wife?

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:03.958
or are you too fucking gutless?

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.129
Why?

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.997
Because it was necessary:

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:17.767
You didn't want to come
back to the Tournament:

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.239
I wasn't going to accept that:

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:22.503
You're the reigning champion:

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.506
Look at you, Joshua!

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:30.947
You're a warrior, gladiator:

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:34.614
Men like you don't die
in your beds,

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.213
they fall on the field:

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.285
They give the crowd

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.886
a glorious death:

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:46.130
Why?

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.731
Why?

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:58.778
Because if I'd have just asked:::

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:03.140
you'd have said no:

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:05.413
You needed
a little motivation--

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.529
Close your eyes:

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.033
You and your wife

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:22.433
will be together soon:

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:25.965
