00:01.068 --> 00:03.071
Previously on
Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.104 --> 00:05.004
I believe in you, Spike.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.708
BUFFY:
 They were
 after Spike all along.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.678
You know what we're up against.
 The First.

00:10.711 --> 00:14.147
Now, Spike, you wanna see
 what a real vampire looks like?

00:14.182 --> 00:16.850
We won't use magic to fight
 this thing until we know
 what we're doing.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.585
Giles.
Buffy.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.153
DAWN:
 They're all slayers?

00:20.187 --> 00:23.490
GILES:
Potential slayers.
Waiting for one to be called.

00:23.524 --> 00:27.661
There were many more like them
all over the world, but,

00:27.695 --> 00:30.164
now there's just a handful,
and they're all on their way
to Sunnydale.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.701
What you fought was
a vampire, but it was
something more than that.

00:33.734 --> 00:38.572
It was a Turok-Han, ferociously
powerful killing machines,
as single-minded as animals.

00:40.039 --> 00:42.176
I think the Turok-Han is here
as an agent of the First.

00:42.210 --> 00:46.514
They want an apocalypse?
Oh, we'll give 'em one.
'Cause we just became an army.

00:46.546 --> 00:50.551
There is only
one thing on this Earth
more powerful than evil,

00:50.584 --> 00:52.552
and that's us.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.390
BUS DRIVER:
Sunnydale. Watch your step.

01:00.293 --> 01:01.962
Next stop, Hillcrest.

01:39.932 --> 01:42.302
(panting)

01:42.335 --> 01:43.670
(grunts)

01:55.182 --> 01:57.151
BUFFY: Hey!

01:58.451 --> 01:59.953
Try picking on
someone my own size.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.689
Aah!

02:08.860 --> 02:10.698
Rona, right?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.801
I just got word
you were arriving.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.770
Y-- You're her.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.705
Her is me.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.044
You know, I thought, uh--
Well, they told me
I'd be safe here.

02:24.076 --> 02:26.546
Right.
Well, you are.

02:26.579 --> 02:31.185
I mean,
you will be... safer...
with me around.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.819
(whispers)
This is good.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.656
Next time
you're attacked--
Whoa, whoa. Next time?

02:35.688 --> 02:38.658
You sayin' I'm gonna
get attacked again?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.493
Welcome
to the Hellmouth.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.500
(theme music playing)

03:50.062 --> 03:51.331
You don't have to do this,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.536
flooring it in the bag.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.437
'Cause nice, big, comfy bed
right here.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.707
I mean, you oughta know.
Your bed.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.911
Yeah. But no, I'm--
I'm okay.

04:03.943 --> 04:07.414
I just-- I like it down here.
I-It's firm.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.917
Funny, you look
a little uncomfortable.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.818
Or is it just me?

04:11.852 --> 04:16.423
No. I'm just, uh, uneasy
'cause Buffy's out.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.293
Right. How many girls
arriving this time?

04:19.326 --> 04:21.461
Just one.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.898
But since Giles
has the coven searching
for other Slayers-in-waiting

04:24.932 --> 04:26.399
to send 'em our way,

04:26.434 --> 04:29.136
I bet we'll be seeing a lot more
soon enough.

04:29.168 --> 04:33.973
So you're saying I should enjoy
having this bed all to myself
as long as I can.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.244
It is starting
to get crowded around here.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.745
Totally.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.281
And with this many girls,
well, I'm just saying,

04:41.314 --> 04:44.784
we don't get another bathroom
in this house soon,
things are gonna get ugly.

04:44.817 --> 04:48.521
Sounds like somebody
had to share mirror time
with a bunch of siblings.

04:48.555 --> 04:52.425
Somebody. Not me.
I only got a half-sister.

04:52.459 --> 04:56.262
And we didn't have to share.
Her bedroom was in
a different wing of the house.

04:56.295 --> 04:59.832
Wing?
Y-Your house had wings?

04:59.867 --> 05:03.536
Yeah.
Just a couple... a few.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.339
Our summer home in the Hamptons
didn't have any at all.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.608
Well, one, actually.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.511
Huh.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.512
Well, that's-- that's--

05:12.545 --> 05:14.781
Huh.
But never mind
my deal.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.384
What's your story, Willow?

05:16.417 --> 05:19.786
I mean, witchcraft? Wow.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.456
That sounds new-agey.

05:23.490 --> 05:27.360
No, i-it's safe to say
that what I practice
is definitely...

05:27.394 --> 05:29.062
"old-agey."

05:29.096 --> 05:31.399
So, show me a trick.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.401
A trick?

05:33.433 --> 05:36.403
You know, pull a rabbit
out of something.
Or make something float!

05:36.437 --> 05:37.704
(chuckles)
Yeah.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.973
Listen, Kennedy, um,
it's almost morning,

05:41.007 --> 05:44.244
and we really need
to get some sleep.

05:44.276 --> 05:48.180
Hey, if I wanted to sleep,
I'd be downstairs catching Z's
with the other girls.

05:50.350 --> 05:55.221
Annabelle was all,
"Control your fear,
control your fear."

05:55.254 --> 05:58.158
Meanwhile, she's the one
that goes scampering off...

05:58.191 --> 06:01.028
right into
that Turok-Han vampire.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.995
Poor Annie.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.031
Great.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.569
So the Slayer
who's supposed to protect us
let her get killed?

06:08.601 --> 06:11.538
She didn't let her.
Annabelle was foolish.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.240
Buffy can't be faulted
for arriving too late.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.175
It's not like
she could have stopped it.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.178
This ubervampire
messed her up pretty good.
No lie.

06:19.211 --> 06:22.115
She still looked
like a big bruise
when I got here,

06:22.149 --> 06:25.619
and that was already,
like... the day after.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.387
And why
isn't she back yet?

06:27.420 --> 06:31.091
Buffy. She left to get
the new girl over an hour ago.

06:33.593 --> 06:36.896
Maybe she ran into trouble.
You don't think maybe
she was too late again.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.798
Maybe--

06:38.831 --> 06:42.302
Maybe we can save the "maybes"
for more of a day-ish part
of the day, girls.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.641
Potential Slayers
can function without sleep.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.043
Me, I'm no good
without my usual 90 minutes.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.781
I'm with him.
Keep the chatter down!

06:53.814 --> 06:56.617
Or speak up
so I can hear you.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.120
I'm bored.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.622
Episode I bored.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.658
You guys
are all still up?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.158
Ah, who needs sleep?

07:07.259 --> 07:09.896
Everybody, this is Rona.
ALL: Hi, Rona.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.331
Hey, Rona.
Hey, Rona.

07:12.365 --> 07:17.437
Um... why is that guy
tied to a chair?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.639
(sighs) The question
you'll soon be asking is,
why isn't he gagged?

07:22.509 --> 07:25.745
Molly, why don't you
show our new house guest
where the kitchen is.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.081
I'm sure she's hungry
after her travels.
Fair enough.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.817
A bit peckish myself.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.754
Bit what as well?

07:33.786 --> 07:35.689
That's English
for hungry.

07:35.723 --> 07:39.826
Oh. Here I thought "hungry"
was English for hungry.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.595
Everything all right?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.497
She had a welcoming committee.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.667
So the First knows
potential Slayers
are making their way here.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.336
I must warn the coven
to be cautious.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.673
The First is always gonna be
one step ahead of us, Giles.
I need to know how to stop it.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.473
No, not stop it.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.442
Hurt it.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.512
I want to hurt it real bad.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.947
Tell me how.
I--
(sighs)

08:00.980 --> 08:03.617
I don't know, Buffy.
I-I--

08:03.651 --> 08:07.220
I've exhausted
all the sources I have left
with little result.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.158
The Watchers' records
are still really
all we have to go on.

08:11.190 --> 08:15.728
I made the rounds myself,
tried to dig up anything useful
from the demon community.

08:15.762 --> 08:19.065
They're a community now?
What's next?
A ladies auxiliary?

08:19.098 --> 08:21.834
The ones that didn't attack me
didn't know anything
or didn't talk.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.971
Either way, we've got squat.
Well, squat's not gonna cut it.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.374
What about the Turok-Han?
XANDER:
The vampire time forgot?

08:27.406 --> 08:31.177
BUFFY:
Time may have forgotten him,
but I sure as hell won't.

08:31.211 --> 08:35.682
We know stakes don't kill it,
but, hey, anything in those
ancient myths about what does?

08:35.716 --> 08:38.150
Sunlight? Fire? Germs?

08:38.183 --> 08:40.052
ANDREW: So, Giles,

08:40.086 --> 08:42.489
with that thing
guarding the entrance
to the First's crib,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.557
how wi Buffy get to Spike?

08:47.860 --> 08:51.030
I really hate to admit this,
but he's not wrong.

08:51.063 --> 08:54.366
And there's no way I'm gonna
be able to help Spike until
that thing is out of the way.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.705
Spike?
Sorry. I-I'm confused.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.673
He's that vampire who's been
killing people, right?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.842
He's the one you're
worried about helping?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.578
Well, we need him to--
(sighs)

09:05.613 --> 09:08.480
He's the one that's been--

09:09.649 --> 09:12.085
I-I-It's complicated, Chloe.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.221
I'm Chloe.
She's Eve.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.890
I-It's just--
Well, we've been talking.

09:17.924 --> 09:21.128
And, well, do we have
some kind of plan?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.296
You know,
any kind of plan

09:23.330 --> 09:25.666
to keep us from dying?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.970
(sighs)
We're working on it.

09:30.003 --> 09:33.740
There is one avenue
that we haven't tried yet.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.043
Giles!
Beljoxa's Eye.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.745
And exactly what part of town
is that avenue in?

09:38.778 --> 09:41.048
I told you no.
Wh--

09:41.081 --> 09:43.549
What is Botox's eye?

09:43.582 --> 09:45.251
Beljoxa's Eye.

09:45.284 --> 09:48.956
It's an oracle-type creature
that-- that exists
in a dark dimension.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.590
Internal vortex, more like.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.793
Fun.
Not really, no.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.729
The point is,
only demons can open
the gateway to it.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.898
Excuse me.
Ex-demon here.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.799
You've still friends
in the fold.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.301
Murderous acquaintances,
anyway.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.135
Look, there's no reason
to think

10:03.169 --> 10:06.306
that this Beljoxa's Eye
will have any of the answers
we're looking for.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.607
I'll take anything I can get.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.844
Anya, please,
we're running out of time.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.380
Spike's running out of time.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.831
(bonds snap tight)

11:06.833 --> 11:09.702
Tsk. Dreaming of me again,
aren't you?

11:10.870 --> 11:12.972
Poor Spike.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.708
He still thinks
I believe in him.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.745
Be realistic.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.312
I don't even believe
in myself.

11:20.346 --> 11:24.484
Least not enough
to risk my skin
to save your ass.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.485
Not enough to face...

11:26.519 --> 11:28.721
(growling, snarling)
that.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.995
I'm sorry, Spike,

11:35.028 --> 11:38.065
but you need to accept this.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.500
You know it never
would have worked out.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.302
It's time to let go
so we can both move on.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.440
I promise,
soon it'll all be--

11:47.474 --> 11:51.745
(murmuring)
She will come for--
She will come for me.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.246
She will come--

11:54.280 --> 11:57.517
She will come for me.

11:57.549 --> 12:00.552
She will come--
She will come for--

12:01.822 --> 12:03.890
She...

12:03.923 --> 12:05.759
will come for me.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.472
No...

12:20.506 --> 12:21.942
I won't.

12:24.812 --> 12:28.048
ANYA: Why not?
You've got the nerve
to ask me that?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.783
Come on.
Torg, that was like
a lifetime ago.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.153
Three.
But who's counting?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.323
You broke my heart,
Anyanka.

12:37.356 --> 12:40.994
Don't be so dramatic, Torg.
You don't even have a heart!

12:41.028 --> 12:44.730
Six spleens, two stomachs,
half a brain, maybe,
but no heart.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.732
Don't mock this.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.970
The night we spent together
was important to me.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.905
It was one date.
It wasn't even a date.

12:52.940 --> 12:57.244
We happened to be invited to
the same massacre, and you
hit on me after I had a few.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.447
I remember.
You wore pink.
Those were entrails.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.515
I'm sorry. Perhaps we
could skip the nostalgic--

13:05.985 --> 13:07.787
Sorry. No, no.
Carry on.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.823
Okay, Torg, look,

13:10.857 --> 13:15.995
you open this tiny little
gateway to the Beljoxa's Eye
for me, and-- and I--

13:17.397 --> 13:19.666
you and I can go...

13:20.667 --> 13:22.668
(sighs)

13:24.636 --> 13:27.340
I'll have sex with you
again.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.708
Ugh. Please!

13:29.741 --> 13:32.379
You gotta-- You're human.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.849
The way you look now,
I wouldn't touch you
for all the kittens in Korea.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.618
You're rejecting my offer
of sexual bribery?

13:38.650 --> 13:41.053
What am I,
a leper in this town?
I can't even give it away!

13:41.087 --> 13:42.554
Come back
when you are a leper.

13:42.588 --> 13:46.225
Uh, perhaps this might
change your mind.

13:46.259 --> 13:50.830
You help us,
and the Slayer will not
kill all your clientele...

13:50.864 --> 13:52.831
and burn your establishment
down to the ground.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.342
(inhaling, exhaling)

14:07.614 --> 14:11.350
(incanting in demonic language)

14:17.557 --> 14:19.759
There's your stinkin' gateway,
Anyanka.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.961
Don't let it hit you
on the way out.

14:25.697 --> 14:28.067
It's the hair, right?
Not attractive?

14:28.100 --> 14:29.369
Come on.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.437
(sighs) Buckle up.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.409
God, I hate this place!

14:37.443 --> 14:39.412
Where's the Beljoxa's Eye?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.280
DEEP VOICE:Here.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.719
Ah. Oh.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.754
Hi.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.389
(rings)

14:50.423 --> 14:54.260
Hello?
No, Giles isn't here right--

14:54.293 --> 14:56.263
Yeah, this is Willow.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.131
Althenea, hi!
How's the coven?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.533
I miss you guys.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.503
Still working out that
Pleiadian spirit conjuring?

15:04.903 --> 15:05.904
What?

15:07.173 --> 15:10.243
Oh. O-Okay. When?

15:10.277 --> 15:14.047
Ow! Watch it!
That's my joystick hand.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.948
I'm not gonna
touch that one.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.085
Okay, listen up, Andrew.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.488
I don't know what to do
with you except that we don't
have time to babysit a hostage.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.256
Especially a hostage
that's gotten
more than a little ripe.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.927
So I'm here to tell you,

15:28.961 --> 15:30.763
you try anything,
try to run--

15:32.198 --> 15:34.933
Did you ever
see the movie Misery?
Six times.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.403
But the book was scarier
than the movie,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.804
'cause instead of
crushing his foot
with a sledgehammer,

15:38.837 --> 15:40.673
Kathy Bates chops it off with--

15:42.209 --> 15:44.610
I'll be good.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.479
Buffy?

15:47.679 --> 15:49.149
Word from the underground.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.784
Another Potential
arrived in town
the day before yesterday.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.587
She's at the Sunspot Motel
near the highway.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.691
The day before yesterday?
Why are we just finding out
about it now?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.960
Bringers killed her Watcher
before he could tell anyone
he sent her.

16:00.994 --> 16:04.364
If it wasn't for
a particularly powerful seer
in the coven,

16:04.397 --> 16:06.198
we wouldn't even
know about it now.

16:06.232 --> 16:10.037
Okay. There's still
a couple hours
of daylight left.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.437
You guys should be safe here.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.639
I'll get her
and bring her back.
I'll go with you.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.842
All right.
Retrieving a Potential.
Let's do it!

16:19.245 --> 16:23.015
Or I could just
go wash up.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.520
Where are they going?

16:28.554 --> 16:31.624
Bring another newbie
in from the cold.
Another one?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.061
Well, the more the better,
I figure.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.363
We need
all the help we can get.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.530
Help. Sure.
That's cool.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.899
But--
What?

16:41.701 --> 16:45.105
Just not sure
more scared Slayer wannabes
translates as help.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.576
(grunting)

16:50.610 --> 16:52.845
(punches landing)

16:57.216 --> 16:59.318
What are we all
doing here?

16:59.351 --> 17:02.154
It's called training.
Didn't your Watcher
ever teach you the word?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.324
I never had a Watcher.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.492
I only just found out
what I was,
or what I might be,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.694
after those crazy-ass monks
came after me.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.731
I meant,
why are we all bothering?

17:12.765 --> 17:15.567
It's not like
we can make a difference.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.538
We've gotta train.
We've gotta keep
our reflexes sharp.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.771
KENNEDY:
We have to be ready.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.040
If something comes down--
 No.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.077
Something's
already come down.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.515
She's right.
And what are we
supposed to do about it?

17:28.548 --> 17:32.285
I mean, I've never
seen a real vampire
in my whole life,

17:32.318 --> 17:34.686
much less slayed one.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.056
I've seen one.

17:37.089 --> 17:40.593
Well, my Watcher
once showed me
a photograph of one.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.695
A blurry photograph.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.698
That's what I'm saying.

17:45.731 --> 17:50.202
Not one of us is remotely
prepared to be activated
as the new Chosen One.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.473
I feel pretty prepared.
Excuse the newness of me,
but just so I understand--

17:54.507 --> 17:56.108
if a Slayer dies--

17:56.143 --> 17:57.676
No, wh a Slayer dies.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.548
I mean,
nobody lives forever.
Right?

18:01.580 --> 18:04.683
One of-- One of us--
Gets activated. Uh-huh.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.155
I'll prefer "called."
I heard there's more than one.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.324
More than one what?
Slayer.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.826
There's another one...
somewhere.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.761
That doesn't make
any sense.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.763
Like any of this does.

18:17.797 --> 18:22.402
No matter how many there are,
one of us is gonna be
the next Slayer,

18:22.434 --> 18:24.871
with the weight of the world
on her shoulders.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.807
(scoffs)
It won't be me.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.442
I mean, not now.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.413
I mean...
I'm too young.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.080
Doesn't work that way.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.150
In fact,
the younger the better.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.652
In fact, I'm starting to think
it might be too late for me.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.288
Never too late.
It could be anyone.

18:42.322 --> 18:46.192
Especially since there are
so few of us left.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.162
They'll just run through
each one of us,

18:49.195 --> 18:50.829
one after the other.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.034
Kinda creepy, huh?

18:55.067 --> 18:59.172
All we do is wait around
for each other to die.

19:05.076 --> 19:08.980
You sure this is it?
Clerk said it's the only
check-in they've had in a week.

19:09.015 --> 19:12.451
Tourism must be down.
Right in the middle
of apocalypse season.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.819
Hello?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.890
It's okay.
We're friendly.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.959
And we have eyes.

19:19.991 --> 19:22.561
Buffy,
kick the door down.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.708
She's cold.
Been dead for days.

19:35.741 --> 19:38.377
Poor kid. She made it
all the way to Sunnydale
just to get herself killed.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.980
If only we'd--
Eve.

19:42.013 --> 19:43.950
Eve,
who's in our house?

19:54.125 --> 19:56.563
Just my personal opinion,

19:56.596 --> 20:01.367
but I don't think the Slayer
can protect us
from the First.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.210
ANDREW: Okay, here's another
interesting thing--

20:11.243 --> 20:13.380
How come the Slayer
is always a girl?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.213
I don't know,
'cause girls are cooler?

20:15.248 --> 20:16.682
I think a-- a guy Slayer
would be bad-ass.

20:16.715 --> 20:20.619
Like if there was this ninja,
a guy Slayer would be like,

20:20.653 --> 20:23.655
"You may be silent,
but this'll shut you up."

20:24.656 --> 20:26.593
Buffy could stomp ninja ass.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.596
The silent warrior?
(laughs) I think not.

20:29.628 --> 20:32.265
She can't even slay
that special vampire.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.535
Everyone's s-s-saying.

20:35.567 --> 20:39.070
Well, everyone should shut up,
and you should stop pretending
anybody here is your friend.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.474
And also, why is she
so about saving Spike?

20:42.509 --> 20:45.811
He's a worse killer than me
by a way lot.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.914
Spike was being controlled
by the First.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.284
And he has a soul now.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.920
Besides,
we'll need his help.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.989
What about me?

20:57.022 --> 20:59.326
Did it ever occur to anyone
that I could be a lot more
useful around here?

20:59.358 --> 21:01.059
I used to be an evil genius.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.894
Hello!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.564
And what was
your genius thing?

21:04.596 --> 21:07.799
Well, um,
raising demons, mostly.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.636
Okay,
so not for now.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.805
But also
there was planning,

21:12.838 --> 21:15.474
there were, um,
blueprints.

21:15.508 --> 21:21.980
I can be in this,
kickin' it righteous.
Yeah. Oh-- Oh, yeah.

21:22.013 --> 21:24.717
Buffy said if you talked enough
I'm allowed to kill you.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.489
Not even.
Even.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.657
License to kill, huh?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.260
Pretty cool.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.631
You know, Timothy Dalton never
got his props, 'cause he came in
at the end of an old regime.

21:38.664 --> 21:41.634
But he had it going on.
He went rogue.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.003
But the Broccolis, they
were just treading water,
stylistically.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.141
I-Is there a language
that you're speaking?

21:53.078 --> 21:54.614
I'm so alone.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.682
Then maybe you shouldn't have
killed your only friend.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.553
I hate that.
You don't even know.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.391
I don't plan to.

22:04.423 --> 22:05.857
The Slayer's
not getting it done.

22:05.892 --> 22:12.030
I have got my ear
to the ground,
and... that's the word.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.269
Do you wanna play
Kevin Bacon?

22:26.211 --> 22:28.346
WILLOW: Buffy.
DAWN: What is it?

22:40.026 --> 22:42.394
Get away from them!
Who?

22:42.429 --> 22:44.431
Get away from who?

22:44.463 --> 22:46.532
What's the problem, officer?

22:46.566 --> 22:48.567
I said get away from them.
Now.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.903
Buffy, what did Eve do?
That's not Eve.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.705
Eve's dead.
I don't understand.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.844
Oops. One more down.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.413
Oh, well.
Can't save 'em all.
Can you, Buffy?

23:02.714 --> 23:04.383
Thanks for
the slumber party, girls.

23:04.416 --> 23:07.385
It's been real fun
these past couple
of nights.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.888
I learned a whole lot--
Shut up and get out.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.291
Or you'll do what?

23:13.325 --> 23:16.596
I'll be sending a guest over
to visit y'all later on tonight.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.432
After the sun goes down,
of course.

23:19.465 --> 23:21.733
Try and make him
feel welcome...

23:21.768 --> 23:23.836
before he rips y'all
to pieces.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.673
Bye.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.943
I need to go wash up again.

23:31.978 --> 23:36.615
It cannot be fought.
It cannot be killed.

23:36.648 --> 23:39.786
The First Evil has been
and always will be,

23:39.818 --> 23:42.387
since before the universe
was born.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.324
Long after
there is nothing else,
it will go on.

23:45.356 --> 23:48.094
I refuse to believe that.
There must be some way
to destroy it.

23:48.126 --> 23:51.597
What, am I talkin'
to myself here?
There's no way!

23:51.631 --> 23:54.133
Okay, we tried.
Let's go, Giles.

23:54.165 --> 23:58.471
Are you saying that the First
will succeed in wiping out
the line of Slayers?

23:58.505 --> 24:03.843
The Eye sees not the future,
only the truth
of the now and before.

24:03.875 --> 24:07.413
Yes, we've all got that.
It's called memory.

24:07.445 --> 24:10.583
Can you help us out
with something
a little more demony?

24:10.616 --> 24:14.353
If the First has been around
for all time, then...

24:14.385 --> 24:16.623
why hasn't it attempted
something like this before?

24:16.655 --> 24:20.960
Why now?
The opportunity has only
recently presented itself.

24:20.992 --> 24:24.530
Opportunity?
The mystical forces
surrounding the Chosen line

24:24.564 --> 24:29.969
have become irrevocably altered,
become unstable, vulnerable.

24:30.001 --> 24:33.539
Something the First did?
The First Evil did not
cause the disruption,

24:33.573 --> 24:38.611
only seized upon it
to extinguish the lives
of the Chosen forever.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.980
Then what has
caused the disruption?

24:41.012 --> 24:43.950
What-- what is responsible
for letting this happen?

24:43.982 --> 24:45.852
The Slayer.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.288
We should run.
And go where, Vi?

24:49.320 --> 24:52.357
DAWN: Annabelle ran,
and look where it got her.
Safer in than out.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.359
MOLLY:
How can you say that?

24:54.393 --> 24:57.997
It was here, Buffy,
in the house,
living with us for days.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.231
And you didn't even know it.
XANDER:
Well, None of us knew it.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.169
It could still be here.
It could be any one of us.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.837
No. The First can only take
the form of dead people.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.507
Yeah, well,
there'll be plenty more
of those soon enough.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.178
We're dropping
like flies here.
That's not right--

25:12.211 --> 25:15.146
(all arguing)
I know
you're all scared.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.048
You know what?
I am too.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.151
But Giles and Anya
will be back soon,

25:19.184 --> 25:21.820
and hopefully they will
have information that we need
to stop the First.

25:21.854 --> 25:26.826
In the meantime,
we need to stick together.
Okay? We're stronger that way.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.096
We cannot afford
to fall apart now.
She's right.

25:30.128 --> 25:33.398
Where would the Justice League
have been if they hadn't
put their differences aside

25:33.432 --> 25:36.268
to stop the Imperium
and his shape-shifting
alien horde?

25:36.301 --> 25:38.037
Don't help me.

25:38.069 --> 25:41.740
Buff, sun goes down
and ubervamp's on its way.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.375
So a plan'd be
good right about now.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.380
Wil, I'm sorry to ask,
but--

25:48.413 --> 25:51.250
I know.
We need a barrier.

25:51.282 --> 25:53.551
A major one.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.488
Something tells me
this vampire doesn't need
an invite to get into the house.

25:58.124 --> 26:01.192
Can you do it?
I'll try.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.128
Try?
You heard her.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.898
Buffy, you sure about Willow
doing the hocus-pocus again?
I-I mean, last time she--

26:06.932 --> 26:08.433
Xander, we don't have
a lot of choices.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.769
CHLOE:
And what if
that doesn't work?

26:09.801 --> 26:11.871
What if that monster
gets through?

26:11.903 --> 26:14.039
Then we'll deal.
RONA: Deal?

26:14.073 --> 26:17.143
Fight, you mean.
How are we supposed to do that?

26:17.175 --> 26:20.378
And with what?
With whatever it takes!
Right?

26:20.412 --> 26:25.384
Buffy, you fought
the Turok-Han,
and it almost killed you.

26:25.416 --> 26:28.755
And you're the real Slayer.
What chance do we have?

26:31.190 --> 26:34.926
Honestly, you staked that thing,
and it didn't die.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.496
No,
but that doesn't--
Maybe it can't be killed.

26:37.528 --> 26:39.798
DAWN:
That mean
we shouldn't try?

26:39.832 --> 26:41.067
RONA:
There's that word again.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.169
KENNEDY:
Hey, it's a good word.

26:43.201 --> 26:47.138
CHLOE: Give up. Can we do
that? Surrender, I mean,
so it won't kill us?

26:48.207 --> 26:49.575
What?

26:49.607 --> 26:52.544
I said,
trying is good.

26:53.645 --> 26:55.280
I just thought
it beared repeating.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.215
(girls talking simultaneously)

26:59.951 --> 27:01.553
KENNEDY:
Come on. We're all
potential Slayers.

27:01.586 --> 27:04.656
Come on, you guys.
 We need to think of--

27:04.691 --> 27:08.426
RONA:
 Fighting's one thing,
 but I don't want to die.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.797
FIRST/EVE:
The time has come...

27:10.829 --> 27:13.665
for all good children...

27:13.700 --> 27:16.301
to say good night.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.970
(snarling)

27:18.003 --> 27:21.173
Take 'em all...
except for her.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.409
(snarling continues)

27:27.179 --> 27:28.815
Well...

27:28.847 --> 27:30.348
alone again.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.990
I just love having you
all to myself.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.066
There's more of them now.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.702
There are two more
out back.

27:50.737 --> 27:53.972
Why aren't they
doing anything?
Attacking?

27:54.006 --> 27:56.275
They don't want in.
They're here to make sure
we don't get out.

27:57.608 --> 27:58.711
Rona.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.717
Like this'll do any good.
I mean, what's the point?

28:04.750 --> 28:07.185
It's this end right here.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.922
You stick that in the bad guys.
Any more questions?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.394
This'll do me.

28:15.426 --> 28:17.528
Are you sure
you know how to use it?

28:19.932 --> 28:21.400
Since I was eight.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.307
Can I have something?

28:29.776 --> 28:32.243
Come on. The Turok-Han's
coming for me too, you know.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.613
I have a right
to defend myself.

28:34.645 --> 28:36.749
If you say so.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.897
Facing my fear.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.133
I'm facing my fear.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.468
Hear that, fear?
I'm facing you.

28:57.502 --> 28:58.569
Wow.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.640
You really can float stuff.

29:01.673 --> 29:04.242
I'm just testing.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.944
Oh. Right.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.247
Heard this voodoo
once turned you
into the big scary.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.085
Big, scary Willow.
That's something
I'd almost like to see.

29:13.118 --> 29:15.086
No, you wouldn't.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.256
I said "almost."

29:18.690 --> 29:20.326
I needed to make sure.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.829
Last time I tried
using magic,

29:23.863 --> 29:27.298
the First, it...
turned it around on me.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.335
Got inside.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.403
I felt it just...

29:31.436 --> 29:35.673
surging through me
in every fiber of my being.

29:35.707 --> 29:39.411
Pure, undiluted evil.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.279
I could taste it.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.714
How's evil taste?

29:45.616 --> 29:47.185
A little chalky.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.487
DAWN: Guys?

29:51.323 --> 29:53.791
Something's happening.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.927
Oh, my God.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.463
(snarling quietly)

29:58.497 --> 30:00.365
Here it comes.

30:00.398 --> 30:02.634
(snarling grows louder)

30:08.307 --> 30:10.009
(snarling continues)

30:10.041 --> 30:12.878
(banging on door)

30:14.180 --> 30:17.715
Caerimonia, Minerva, saepio,

30:17.749 --> 30:20.286
saepire, saepsi.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.955
Um, deflector shields.
Deflector shields up.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.391
Willow?

30:26.491 --> 30:29.929
Saepio impedimentle.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.865
It's working,
for the moment!

30:35.534 --> 30:37.669
BUFFY:
Wil?

30:37.702 --> 30:39.837
(grunts)
It's-- It's strong.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.374
It's hurting her.
Hang on, Willow.

30:42.407 --> 30:45.411
(snarling continues)
I don't know.

30:45.443 --> 30:48.480
DAWN: She can't hold it.
What do we do?
What do we do?

30:48.513 --> 30:51.450
Run.
Everybody run.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.471
Aaah!

31:16.741 --> 31:18.609
Come on!

31:23.481 --> 31:24.650
You all right?

31:26.251 --> 31:29.255
Yeah. I just--

31:29.288 --> 31:31.722
I don't understand how...

31:31.757 --> 31:33.892
Buffy's death mucked up
the whole Slayer mojo.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.929
You know? It's not like
she hasn't died before.
It's not because she died.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.698
The Beljoxa's Eye
was quite clear
about that...

31:39.730 --> 31:41.933
in its enigmatic way.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.170
It's because
she lives... again.

31:45.636 --> 31:47.338
Buffy's not responsible
for that.

31:48.807 --> 31:51.042
Oh.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.045
No.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.247
Willow and me...

31:55.280 --> 31:57.548
and Xander and Tara.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.451
We're the ones
who brought Buffy back.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.721
We're the reason
the First is here, the reason
those girls were murdered.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.224
No, it's our fault.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.826
The world would have
been better off if Buffy
had just stayed dead.

32:21.539 --> 32:24.442
Okay, no Bringers following.
I guess they'll save us
for old Snaggletooth.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.645
Where is the Turok-Han?
Right behind us.
Time to split up.

32:27.679 --> 32:31.282
Split up?
We're splitting up?
Is that wise?

32:31.317 --> 32:33.318
Willow, take everyone
and find a safe location.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.253
I know a place.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.324
What are you gonna do?
Try to slow the Turok down.
Lead him away from you guys.

32:38.356 --> 32:41.292
Get him to chase me.
Buffy, you can't
take that thing on yourself.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.028
I'll stay.
No!

32:43.061 --> 32:45.163
Hey! I need that!

32:45.197 --> 32:48.166
Willow, Xander, take everyone
to a safe location.
Get 'em out of here. Now!

32:49.901 --> 32:51.502
Have to go, Dawnie.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.710
(snarling)

33:09.654 --> 33:12.490
(roaring)

33:36.548 --> 33:38.416
Come on, people.
We gotta move.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.387
I'm moving.
Climbing's not my thing.
I got an inner ear condition.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.490
XANDER:
Is falling your thing?

33:44.522 --> 33:47.759
'Cause if you don't
pick up the pace, I'm gonna
come up there and drop your ass.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.895
Way to keep up morale
in a crisis.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.898
No wonder
Buffy's the leader.

33:53.932 --> 33:57.103
Some leader.
This is crazy.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.636
RONA:
You got that right.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.406
(both grunting)

34:01.440 --> 34:03.108
What are we doing
down here?

34:03.142 --> 34:04.976
Quieter.
Faster.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.422
Where are we?

34:17.456 --> 34:20.726
Future site of
the new public library.
Opening up May 2003.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.960
If I ever get back to work,
that is.
You call this a safe location?

34:23.994 --> 34:26.231
VI:
It's the middle of nothing.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.934
This'll do.
Okay, everyone, spread out,
take positions.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.971
Um, what's my position?

34:33.003 --> 34:37.976
And don't make a sound.
That's the plan? Spread out?

34:38.009 --> 34:41.380
That thing is gonna kill Buffy,
and then it's going
to come after us.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.481
For all we know
it's killing her right now.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.952
Or it could just
skip that part
and come straight here.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.021
(snarling)

35:03.934 --> 35:06.304
(snarling)

35:12.643 --> 35:14.480
(murmurs)
Oh, my God.

35:14.512 --> 35:17.483
Oh, no. No, no, no!

35:20.985 --> 35:22.019
DAWN:
Buffy?

35:22.052 --> 35:23.289
MOLLY:
What are you doing?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.795
Just watch.
It's show time.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.139
BUFFY:
Looks good, doesn't it?

35:42.173 --> 35:44.210
They're trapped in here.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.711
Terrified.
Meat for the beast.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.713
And there's nothing
they can do but wait.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.487
That's all they've been doing
for days,

35:56.521 --> 35:58.856
waiting to be picked off,

35:58.889 --> 36:01.827
having nightmares about
monsters that can't be killed.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.663
But I don't believe in that.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.266
I always find a way.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.702
I'm the thing that monsters
have nightmares about.

36:11.737 --> 36:15.373
And right now you and me
are gonna show 'em why.

36:17.242 --> 36:18.710
It's time.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.313
Welcome to Thunderdome.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.717
Two men enter.
One man leaves.

36:57.983 --> 37:01.219
This.
You planned this.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.722
Letting the barrier fail.
Bringing us here.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.724
You and Buffy.

37:07.793 --> 37:11.530
MOLLY:
Honestly, you staked that thing
and it didn't die.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.632
No,
but that doesn't--
Maybe it can't be killed.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.369
Willow, can you hear me?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.304
Yeah.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.139
We're losing them.
 We can't let that happen.

37:22.172 --> 37:24.208
I have an idea.
 Grab Xander.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.612
Xander.
What?

37:26.644 --> 37:28.880
I've gotta slay the Neandervamp
 to get Spike out of that cave.

37:28.914 --> 37:32.150
But I need those girls
 to see me do it.
 I get it.

37:32.182 --> 37:34.853
But this isn't the best venue
 for a smackdown.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.590
DAWN: We can whine
like little wusses,
or we can get off our asses--

37:39.625 --> 37:41.960
XANDER:
 I know just the place.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.833
(groaning)

38:47.425 --> 38:49.894
(snarling)
(gasping)

38:54.199 --> 38:56.735
It's killing her!
We have to do something!

38:56.768 --> 38:58.936
Wait!

39:00.338 --> 39:01.572
(snarling continues)

39:39.744 --> 39:41.980
(screaming)

39:53.324 --> 39:55.726
See? Dust.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.327
Just like the rest of 'em.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.300
I don't know
what's coming next,

40:05.135 --> 40:07.237
but I do know
it's gonna be just like this:

40:07.271 --> 40:09.641
hard, painful.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.311
But in the end
it's gonna be us.

40:14.344 --> 40:18.215
If we all do our parts,
believe it,

40:18.248 --> 40:20.518
we'll be the ones
left standing.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.956
Here endeth the lesson.

41:02.159 --> 41:04.128
(chuckles)

41:05.362 --> 41:07.498
A knife now, is it?

41:09.134 --> 41:10.635
What'll...

41:10.668 --> 41:13.672
What'll that--
(exhaling)

41:15.139 --> 41:17.041
You-- You can't hurt me.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.210
You're--

41:20.244 --> 41:22.847
You're just a bloody figment,
you are.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.715
You're just--

41:47.438 --> 41:49.740
(sobbing quietly)

42:40.826 --> 42:43.260
Grr! Arrgh!
