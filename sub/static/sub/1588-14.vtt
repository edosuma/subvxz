HILDIE: Hurry up, Thomas.

00:55.557 --> 01:00.557
Did you get the mouse whisker
for the transformation potion?

01:00.761 --> 01:03.697
In the cauldron with it.

one mouse whisker?

01:17.612 --> 01:20.014
You're not the only sorceress
in the family

01:20.081 --> 01:22.016
who can make
a transformation potion.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.918
BEATIE: Just the bestest,
Sister.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.419
HILDIE: That's what you think.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.755
I'm pretty handy myself,
you know.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.192
Thomas, Jerry!
Enough with you two!

01:31.259 --> 01:32.993
Pestering cat,
maddening mouse.

01:33.060 --> 01:36.960

02:56.878 --> 03:01.878
HILDIE: Gracious, Tom,
it's not the first time
we've summoned you.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.197
BEATIE: Why, Sister,
I think he's gone batty.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.399
HILDIE: Yes, it appears so.

03:18.466 --> 03:22.002
Perhaps getting some
fresh marsh beetle larva
will focus your mind.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.106
Hurry, Tom!

03:24.172 --> 03:27.442
BEATIE: Marsh beetle, huh?
I prefer something
more potent.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.410
HILDIE: Last I checked,
I'm the witch
brewing this potion, not you.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.146
So, back off.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.382
You haven't come for the eye
of a newt, have you?

03:35.449 --> 03:39.454
(CRASHING)

03:39.520 --> 03:44.520
I want to help, really,
but I'm fresh out.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.561
Why are you such a mess?

03:46.628 --> 03:51.132
None of the sisters'
crazy potions
ever call for a cat.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.666
Are we playing charades?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.200
I love charades!

03:54.267 --> 03:56.637
How many words?

03:56.703 --> 03:58.072
Little Bo Peep.

03:58.139 --> 04:00.874
The Loch Ness monster.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.377
I'm dreadful at this game.

04:03.444 --> 04:07.815
Ah, Jerry's been turned
into a vampire.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.750
Okay, I cheated.

04:13.587 --> 04:18.058
(TEETH CHATTERING)

04:18.125 --> 04:20.461
HILDIE: If you're looking
for fresh beetle larva,

04:20.528 --> 04:23.730
I strongly suggest
under the porch.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.100
Yes, outside.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.770
That's where porches
generally are.

04:28.837 --> 04:33.837
And cats who don't do
as they're told.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.153
Nope.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.390
Nope.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.361
Try again.

04:53.427 --> 04:57.177
It's purple, not yellow.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.243
(TEETH CHATTERING)

05:09.310 --> 05:13.480
HILDIE: Did you find
the beetle larva?

05:13.547 --> 05:15.850
Good kitty.

05:15.917 --> 05:19.387
BEATIE: I find
letting the brew steep
a good long while

05:19.453 --> 05:22.756
allows the ingredients
to create a stronger bond.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.624
Perhaps, while we sleep.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.792
(HISSING)

05:25.859 --> 05:27.862
HILDIE: Yes, of course.

05:27.929 --> 05:32.733
After I add the candied slugs
that Thomas is getting.

05:32.799 --> 05:34.835
(HISSING)

05:34.902 --> 05:37.071
Now, cat!

05:37.137 --> 05:40.341
BEATIE: Candied slugs?
Interesting.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.944
HILDIE: Shush, Beatie,
you may be firstborn,

05:43.011 --> 05:45.246
but it doesn't make you
the wicked witch of all.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.948
(TEETH CHATTERING)

05:48.015 --> 05:50.751
Dracula's in his home.
You're safe.

05:50.817 --> 05:54.589
Whew!

05:54.655 --> 05:57.824
A ladle, huh? That'll keep
the vampires away.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.526
I'm kidding.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.961
(CRASHING)

06:01.028 --> 06:02.729
But I do know what will.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.699
Lived with one way back.

06:04.766 --> 06:07.168
I've been working
on a little demonstration.

06:07.235 --> 06:10.504
See? There's three basic ways
to get rid of a vampire.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.942
First, there's sunlight,
turns them into dust.

06:14.008 --> 06:16.910
Then there's garlic,
makes their breath stink.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.847
And more importantly,
go up in smoke.

06:19.914 --> 06:24.051
And finally, a wooden stake
through their heart
usually does the trick.

06:24.118 --> 06:26.086
It's the last resort.

06:26.153 --> 06:31.153
It'll be morning soon,
we can start then.

06:32.326 --> 06:35.026
(BATS SCREECHING)

06:46.173 --> 06:49.023
Morning, sunshine.

06:52.947 --> 06:57.947
Now use the mirror
to direct the sunlight
into the hole.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.823
Hey, easy, boy.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.260
Let me help you.

07:06.327 --> 07:11.327
The sisters
are not gonna like that.

07:15.069 --> 07:18.106
(SCREAMING)

07:18.173 --> 07:21.542
It's impossible for your luck
to get any worse.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.143
-(SHATTERS)
-(HISSING)

07:23.210 --> 07:26.581
Try the garlic.
Remember? Never fails.

07:26.647 --> 07:31.647
Otherwise, you're destined
to be one, too.

07:34.221 --> 07:38.025
Get closer.

07:38.092 --> 07:39.726
Have you never bowled?

07:39.793 --> 07:44.664
Should I ask for rails?

07:44.731 --> 07:47.581
(TEETH CHATTERING)

08:12.259 --> 08:13.661
You can't stop now.

08:13.728 --> 08:15.463
There's one last thing
you can do.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.229
The final resort.

08:26.674 --> 08:31.674
Now, drive the stake
through his tiny
vampire heart.

08:33.481 --> 08:36.049
You forgot the stake,
didn't you?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.016
Phew!

08:42.089 --> 08:43.991
Tell me you're kidding.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.707
(GIGGLING)

08:52.767 --> 08:57.767
I think the little
bloodsucker's gone mad.

09:01.509 --> 09:06.509
I've got to stop
getting involved
with these two.

09:09.283 --> 09:10.751
BEATIE: Good morning, Thomas.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.654
You've been very busy,
haven't you?

09:13.721 --> 09:16.590
I don't love
what you've done to the place.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.426
That was mother's broom.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.495
HILDIE: And grandmother's
spell book.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.765
Not to mention
the smoke and the dust.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.501
BEATIE: I think Tom needs
a little fresh air...

09:27.568 --> 09:30.471
In the dark woods.
With the nose.

09:30.538 --> 09:34.141
BOTH: Indoor cat,
damages untold,

09:34.208 --> 09:37.578
cast him out into the cold!

09:37.645 --> 09:42.645
BEATIE: So long, cat,
and goodbye, mouse.

09:48.122 --> 09:52.092
I remember once turning a newt
into a loaf of pumpkin bread.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.395
It was very tasty.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.697
HILDIE: I remember it being
a bit dry myself.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.633
I don't think
I taste very good.

09:58.699 --> 10:03.536
HILDIE: Relax, Newt,
I'm transforming you
into a glorious eagle.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.207
An eagle, huh?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.409
(HILDIE SCREAMS)

10:08.476 --> 10:11.146
BEATIE: Oh, too bad, Sister.

10:11.212 --> 10:15.550
And I really thought
you were going to

10:15.617 --> 10:20.354
HILDIE: If you weren't
constantly distracting,
Beatie, I would have.

10:20.421 --> 10:25.371
Into the cold
with you as well.

10:25.493 --> 10:27.227
Guys, it's me, Newt.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.564
I'm an eagle.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.099
Hey, where are you going?

10:32.166 --> 10:32.899
Can I come?
