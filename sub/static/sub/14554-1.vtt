Louaaa *

Louie... **

00:34.202 --> 00:35.569
One time I was jerking off--

00:35.636 --> 00:37.037
This is another--
this is another aging thing.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.672
I was jerking off

00:38.739 --> 00:41.342
and I looked at my penis
and it was blurry

00:41.409 --> 00:44.512
because my eyes... are going.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.647
So I can't--

00:46.714 --> 00:48.349
Because you're suppose to get
reading glasses when you--

00:48.416 --> 00:49.617
when this becomes blurry

00:49.683 --> 00:52.320
and that's exactly...

00:52.386 --> 00:56.657
That's the precise
fixed length.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.026
And so it's blurry now,

00:59.093 --> 01:00.828
so I gotta go
get reading glasses

01:00.894 --> 01:02.796
and I have to--

01:06.634 --> 01:08.302
Hmm...

01:08.369 --> 01:12.039
So I had to go to the drug store
and buy reading glasses...

01:12.106 --> 01:13.341
and I felt weird, like,

01:13.407 --> 01:15.343
"She knows I'm jerking off
with these."

01:15.409 --> 01:17.245
Like, she's just
looking at me like,

01:17.311 --> 01:20.881
"You ain't reading shit,
you dirty old..."

01:20.948 --> 01:22.550
Anyway, so I got
reading glasses

01:22.616 --> 01:25.119
and I looked at it
and it was still blurry.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.920
So I don't think
it's my eyes.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.256
I think my dick
is getting blurry.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.823
I think I've actually...

01:32.560 --> 01:33.627
But here's the good news--
I am getting older

01:33.694 --> 01:35.696
but I also have more
money than I used to have

01:35.763 --> 01:38.065
so I'm gonna get a new--
I'm gonna upgrade my dick.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.268
I'm gonna get a new dick.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.870
I'm amazed that I haven't
heard about that.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.340
Like, that rich old guys--

01:46.407 --> 01:49.677
Why aren't they
getting new dicks ?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.845
'Cause with the amount of money
poured into people's tits

01:51.912 --> 01:53.181
and their faces,

01:53.247 --> 01:55.349
how are old, rich,
asshole guys--

01:55.416 --> 01:56.984
"I'm getting a new one!"

01:57.050 --> 01:59.687
On the golf course, "Getting
my new dick on Wednesday."

01:59.753 --> 02:02.590
And it just-- and I don't mean
like a synthetic kind of

02:02.656 --> 02:07.027
transvestite kind of
pink pea pod Frankenstein...

02:07.094 --> 02:08.629
grafted-off-your-leg dick.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.799
I mean some dead kid's dick
on your body.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.867
Like a new...

02:13.934 --> 02:15.436
( chuckling )

02:15.503 --> 02:18.706
"Happy ending to a sad story"
on your body.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.909
'Cause that's--
I wanna get on that list now.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.512
The next time some

02:24.578 --> 02:28.316
22-year-old
Puerto Rican track star...

02:28.382 --> 02:30.951
gets hit by a bus,

02:31.018 --> 02:33.354
I get his
dick right here,

02:33.421 --> 02:38.192
his beautiful, shiny, brown dick
on my body, next to--

02:38.259 --> 02:40.661
'Cause I'm keeping
the old one.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.963
I'm gonna have...

02:43.030 --> 02:45.165
I'm gonna have both
for awhile.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.371
Like when they had-- they were
building the new Yankee Stadium

02:50.438 --> 02:52.506
and the old one was still there,

02:52.573 --> 02:53.874
that's gonna be
what this is like.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.905
I can't...

03:28.942 --> 03:30.778
"Parking of vehicles
only authorized."
I mean...

03:30.844 --> 03:32.212
Only author--

03:32.280 --> 03:34.482
Okay, "Parking permitted
anytime after midnight."

03:34.548 --> 03:36.484
Yeah, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
Is it after midnight
right now or is it before ?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.585
It's before midnight
right now.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.586
Yeah, but it's
also after.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.822
I gotta go, I gotta...

03:56.169 --> 03:57.738
Hi.
Hey, hi.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.806
Hi.
Hi.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.107
Uh, nightmare.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.542
Yeah ?
Yeah, total nightmare.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.110
Just everybody screaming
at each other

04:03.176 --> 04:04.912
and nobody listening to me.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.681
The meeting goes on for two
hours-- nothing gets done.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.050
And then that cooz Lisa
started her shit with me again.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.852
Shit, really?
Yeah.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.889
Oh, God!
She was just stupid.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.692
I'd like her but she's
faking it to make me sweat.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.561
You should just
quit that job.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.063
What kind of a thing
is that to say to me?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.098
Sorry.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.467
Say that to me,
I should quit my job.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.636
You should quit
your job.
I like my job.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.038
Anyway, I'm having lunch
with George tomorrow

04:31.104 --> 04:33.541
and even though I hate to use
my connection with him for...

04:35.208 --> 04:36.810
Thank you.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.648
Did you already eat?
Is this dessert?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.950
No, no...

04:43.016 --> 04:44.318
Never mind.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.287
Let's not have
the food talk.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.188
So you have the kids
this weekend?

04:48.255 --> 04:49.823
No, they're with Janet.

04:49.890 --> 04:50.958
Shows?

04:51.024 --> 04:53.494
Just a couple
at the Cellar.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.464
All right, well, let's get
together during the day.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.467
Sure.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.372
Okay, what is up?

05:04.438 --> 05:07.040
Nothing.
You look weird.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.709
We'll hang out--
we'll hang out during the day.

05:08.776 --> 05:09.743
That's fine.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.579
Okay, Louie,
if you're gonna sit there

05:11.645 --> 05:12.413
and pretend like
nothing's wrong,

05:12.480 --> 05:14.648
you're gonna drive me crazy.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.850
Look, you're doing
your mouthy things.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.452
You're trying
not to say something.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.788
I'm not--
you know what, I'm--

05:20.854 --> 05:22.356
I'm just tired.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.757
No, you're not
acting tired.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.327
You're acting
sort of tense and...

05:27.395 --> 05:29.997
Oh, God, why-- why does it
have to be like this?

05:30.063 --> 05:33.166
What is this, a game of
relationship charades?

05:33.233 --> 05:34.334
What is on your mind?

05:34.402 --> 05:36.704
Y'know, nothing,
there's nothing...

05:36.770 --> 05:39.373
Okay, well, I know it's
about me, I know that.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.108
Why do you
think you know that?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.444
Because you have zero problem
telling me anything

05:43.511 --> 05:44.878
that's wrong with you,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.279
except when it's
about me... right?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.649
And then I've gotta
drag it out of you.

05:48.716 --> 05:52.753
Something is wrong,
right?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.522
Right.
Mouth.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.157
Okay, let's see,
um...

05:57.224 --> 06:00.160
you are depressed.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.230
You feel like
I'm pushing too hard.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.698
You are scared of going to

06:04.765 --> 06:07.267
my mom's house
for Thanksgiving.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.837
You just wanna break up
with me and...

06:12.139 --> 06:14.442
Oh, my God.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.377
Oh, my God, are you
breaking up with me?

06:17.445 --> 06:19.279
No, that's--
no, that's craz--

06:19.346 --> 06:22.315
Oh, my God, Louie...

06:22.382 --> 06:24.552
you're breaking up
with me.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.462
You can't break up
with me.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.730
You can't
break up with me.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.931
I'm not.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.800
But why-- what?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.869
You can't break up
with me because...

06:41.935 --> 06:43.637
Well, I'm not
anything to you.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.639
We're not anything,
we're nothing, y'know?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.340
We've been nothing
for six months.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.408
I haven't
even met your kids.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.110
Yeah, but that's--

06:50.177 --> 06:52.012
I'm just trying to be really
careful with them, because--

06:52.079 --> 06:53.681
Please, we're not
talking about that.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.015
Louie...

07:01.021 --> 07:02.690
Oh, my God.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.495
Okay.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.864
Okay, let's just--
we're gonna...

07:10.931 --> 07:12.766
Oh, my...

07:12.833 --> 07:13.734
Oh, my God!

07:13.801 --> 07:15.536
Okay, all right,
just do it.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.938
Just-- let's just--
let's just say it.

07:18.005 --> 07:18.839
What?

07:18.906 --> 07:20.207
Just break up
with me, okay?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.575
Just--
April--

07:21.642 --> 07:23.811
Just say it so that
we can be done with it.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.646
Okay, I like you,
you're a good guy.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.348
I have no regrets,
but you could only do...

07:28.415 --> 07:29.650
y'know, this much

07:29.717 --> 07:31.218
and now you
can't do it anymore

07:31.284 --> 07:33.954
so you should just say
the words and we'll move on.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.256
Please don't eat
that ice cream right now.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.791
( sighing )

07:39.326 --> 07:42.663
Okay, here we go,
let's hear it.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.098
April, I'm not breaking up
with you; I'm just tired.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.535
Oh, Jesus.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.302
You're gonna make me
do it, aren't you?

07:49.369 --> 07:50.671
This is amazing.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.272
You're gonna make me
break up with myself.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.607
That's not what--
I-- I--

07:53.674 --> 07:56.343
I'm gonna make it really
easy for you, okay?

07:56.409 --> 07:58.311
This is how
it's gonna work.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.647
I am gonna say to you,

07:59.713 --> 08:01.414
"We should not
be together anymore,"

08:01.481 --> 08:04.417
and then after I say that,
you just sit here.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.686
You don't say anything...
But I'm not--

08:05.753 --> 08:08.421
...for, like,
17 seconds, okay?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.758
Just sit in silence

08:10.824 --> 08:13.193
and then we'll be
done with it.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.663
I'm not--
Here we go.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.233
We shouldn't be together
anymore.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.020
Okay, good job,
we're done.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.055
I...

08:42.122 --> 08:44.457
They made very nice tender
whole chicken for you.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.960
Thank you.
You're a doll.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.428
Here, why don't you
eat this salad

08:48.495 --> 08:50.230
when you're done
with your ice cream.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.267
( bells jingling )

09:00.407 --> 09:01.975
( exhaling )

09:12.686 --> 09:15.288
( drill rattling )

09:20.861 --> 09:22.596
Hey!
( man )
Yeah.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.564
Hey, hey, hey, that's...

09:24.632 --> 09:26.934
That's my car.
Okay.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.736
Well, I gotta
get it out of there.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.103
Well, we're working.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.305
But I didn't--
it didn't say you--

09:32.372 --> 09:34.374
You didn't say you guys were
gonna be doing all of that.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.010
Well, you shouldn't
have parked there.
What...

09:37.077 --> 09:38.612
What the hell are you guys
doing, anyway?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.313
I don't know.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.216
Can you...

10:04.805 --> 10:06.874
( horn honking in distance )

10:23.490 --> 10:24.692
( beeping )

10:45.779 --> 10:47.547
Hi.
Hi.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.582
You looking to
buy a bike?
Oh, no, no.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.884
No?
Just, uh...

10:50.951 --> 10:53.987
Are-- are these, uh...

10:54.054 --> 10:55.488
These are really nice,
huh?

10:55.555 --> 10:57.991
Oh, yeah,
these are pretty sweet.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.427
Do you ride a bike
in the city?
Sure.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.162
It's dangerous or...

11:02.229 --> 11:03.230
Yeah.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.497
I've laid a few down.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.800
I got, y'know,
I got some of that.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.902
Whoa.
I've got some of that.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.637
You gotta go down
with these kind of--

11:10.704 --> 11:12.806
Yeah.
Wow.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.407
Yeah, I can't be
doing none of that.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.043
Oh, wow, more?
Yeah, oh, yeah.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.978
That's nasty.
It gets better, man, here.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.513
Really?
Busted-up knees.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.750
Chicken skins-- you gotta have
these in the wintertime.
Okay, yeah.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.117
I got fluid in my knees.
Oh, yeah.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.119
I'm still walking, though.
Yeah, well--

11:26.186 --> 11:27.520
I got a permanent limp
but I'm walking.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.621
Well, I can't be
doing none of that.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.157
That's crazy.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.525
I got kids,
so that's not...
All right, man.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.828
What-- But, uh...

11:34.895 --> 11:37.664
Um, how--
how much is that bike?

11:37.731 --> 11:40.300
This one's 75.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.701
7,500?
Yeah.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.003
That's it?
That's it.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.972
Wow.
You get 45 miles
to the gallon.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.374
Really?
You can park it anywhere.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.943
So it's actually smart
to buy a motorcycle.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.256
( singing in foreign language )

12:32.019 --> 12:35.455
( engines revving )

12:42.930 --> 12:46.266
( engines revving )

12:55.909 --> 12:57.477
( tires screeching )

13:03.884 --> 13:05.953
( woman crying )

13:06.019 --> 13:10.023
( woman )
Why won't somebody help me?!

13:10.090 --> 13:11.458
Why?!

13:11.524 --> 13:14.527
I'm in pain here!

13:14.594 --> 13:18.231
Won't somebody help me?!
Let's take
a look here!

13:18.298 --> 13:21.701
I need help!

13:21.768 --> 13:23.670
( crying )

13:23.736 --> 13:25.638
Y'know, there's nothing dumber
than riding a motorcycle.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.140
It's just stupid.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.642
We get motorcycle fatalities
in here all the time

13:29.709 --> 13:32.545
and, I gotta tell ya,
I feel sorry for none of them.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.713
Had a guy in here
a week ago--

13:33.780 --> 13:35.215
four pieces.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.317
His legs both cut off,
the torso,

13:37.384 --> 13:39.887
and his helmet in a bag
with just his head in it.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.822
Cut off at the neck.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.858
You know what
his mom said to me?

13:44.925 --> 13:47.127
"Is he gonna be
all right?"

13:47.194 --> 13:50.197
( woman )
Why won't somebody help me?

13:50.263 --> 13:53.633
Why, God?!

13:53.700 --> 13:55.235
Oh, shit.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.304
Listen, I need a--
I need to get to a phone.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.940
Can I get up and get
to a phone?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.774
No, I can't let you up.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.143
But I gotta
call my ex-wife,

14:03.210 --> 14:04.912
I gotta tell her I can't
pick up the kids.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.579
Nobody knows I'm here.
Here.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.983
Use mine.
Thank you.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.684
Doctor, the CAT scan's ready

14:11.751 --> 14:13.286
if you wanna take a look.
Okay.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.200
Hello, hello.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.002
( woman )
Hello.
Hey.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.938
Hey, Janet, it's Louie.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.540
I'm calling from a--
not-- not my phone.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.008
Hey.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.776
You're picking up
the girls, right?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.046
No, I can't.
What?

14:39.112 --> 14:40.447
Louie, no, you can't
do that to me right now.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.951
You don't-- no,
I, seriously, I can't come.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.752
Louie, I am always happy
to cover for you

14:45.818 --> 14:47.154
but this is
unfair, okay?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.221
It's too short notice.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.256
You come
and you get them.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.858
I cannot because
I'm in a hospital

14:51.925 --> 14:54.094
with my head strapped
to a thing.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.695
Louie, what happened?

14:55.762 --> 14:58.198
I got in an accident.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.799
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.101
How bad are you?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.936
I'm waiting for
the doctor to come back.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.271
I think I might be okay.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.939
What happened?

15:06.006 --> 15:10.110
Well, it was a...

15:11.744 --> 15:14.781
It was a motorcycle
accident.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.816
Motorcycle?

15:16.883 --> 15:18.485
Yeah.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.053
I bought a motorcycle

15:20.120 --> 15:23.256
and then I got in
an accident on it.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.094
Okay, so...

15:27.160 --> 15:29.196
you-- you can't come
pick up the kids?

15:30.363 --> 15:31.531
Nope.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.268
Okay.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.704
Well, good luck
with that.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.009
He bought a motorcycle.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.411
He got in
an accident.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.878
Prick.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.580
Ass-necked idiot.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.482
What the hell he's
doing on a motorcycle?!

15:49.549 --> 15:52.119
( woman )
Why won't somebody help me?!

15:52.185 --> 15:53.420
Well, you're fine.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.754
Goddamn lucky.

15:54.821 --> 15:55.955
Really?
Yeah.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.890
Nothing broken.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.692
Nothing broken?
Yeah.

16:01.995 --> 16:05.032
Do I have any
internal-- Ow!

16:05.098 --> 16:07.467
( groaning )

16:07.534 --> 16:09.636
This-- it hurts a lot.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.172
Yeah, well, film is good,
your CAT is good,

16:12.239 --> 16:13.840
you're gonna
be in a little pain

16:13.906 --> 16:16.043
but you don't
need us.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.480
( woman )
Ow!

16:20.547 --> 16:23.050
Ow, ow, all right!

16:25.852 --> 16:27.454
What about Obama?

16:30.790 --> 16:31.491
( horn honking )

16:49.142 --> 16:50.943
( doorbell )

16:51.010 --> 16:52.212
I'm coming.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.115
Shit.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.287
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.425
Oh, hi.
Hi.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.160
I've been trying to
call you since yesterday.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.995
Yeah, my phone's broken.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.097
Listen, I'm sorry
to just come over

17:10.163 --> 17:11.598
but I left
my laptop here.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.233
Oh, man, okay.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.034
Can I get it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
come on in.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.070
Plus clothes
that I have here.
Okay.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.238
Jeez, are you okay?

17:18.305 --> 17:20.707
I, uh, had an accident.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.275
What do you mean?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.743
Well, I got hit
by a truck.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.112
Jesus!

17:25.178 --> 17:26.146
I was in
the hospital.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.548
Oh, my God, Louie!

17:28.615 --> 17:30.183
Well, come sit down.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.884
Is no one
taking care of you?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.052
Well, I didn't
break anything, so...

17:33.120 --> 17:35.122
Who cares?
You were in the hospital.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.756
You got hit by a truck.
Yeah.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.125
Oh, my God!

17:38.191 --> 17:39.426
It's my leg,
really hurts.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.694
You need some help here.
Thank you.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.831
Here you go.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.868
Thank you.
Wow.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.570
You feeling better?
Yeah.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.004
Thank you very much.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.607
Thanks a lot.
It's okay.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.680
Okay, well...

18:02.115 --> 18:04.584
If you need anything,
you can call me.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.789
I'm gonna go.
Well...

18:11.458 --> 18:12.425
Um...

18:12.492 --> 18:14.561
Stay?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.429
Stay?

18:16.496 --> 18:19.532
Yeah, do you
wanna stay?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.501
Stay.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.870
How are you
saying "stay"?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.273
I mean, how do you
mean that?

18:26.339 --> 18:29.342
Just that maybe you--
maybe you should.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.678
Do you mean that you need more
help from me right now?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.646
No, I just...

18:33.713 --> 18:37.217
What do you mean by,
"Do I wanna stay?"

18:37.284 --> 18:39.686
I, uh... well, I...

18:39.752 --> 18:42.555
I'm just saying that
maybe you should stay here

18:42.622 --> 18:44.324
and...

18:44.391 --> 18:46.659
we can go see your mom
on Thanksgiving--

18:46.726 --> 18:48.461
Look, Louie.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.297
You're hurt,
so I helped you,

18:50.363 --> 18:52.732
but as far as I'm concerned,
we're still broken up.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.501
Well, maybe...

18:54.567 --> 18:57.069
maybe we should get back
together and try and--

18:57.136 --> 18:59.071
All right, let's...

18:59.138 --> 19:00.673
Because here's what
I think is going on--

19:00.740 --> 19:04.477
It's kind of weird for you
that I'm here,

19:04.544 --> 19:05.612
helping you
and feeding you

19:05.678 --> 19:07.013
and then I'm just
gonna leave,

19:07.079 --> 19:08.848
and you're
feeling bad and guilty

19:08.915 --> 19:10.483
because I'm being nice

19:10.550 --> 19:12.919
so now you're
just saying this.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.187
Is that...

19:14.254 --> 19:16.989
I'm just saying...

19:17.056 --> 19:18.791
let's go to
your mom's.

19:18.858 --> 19:22.094
Louie, if we go to my mom's
house for Thanksgiving

19:22.161 --> 19:24.297
with my whole family

19:24.364 --> 19:28.167
and sleep together in my
childhood bedroom, that's it.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.702
We're a couple.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.804
You get that, right?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.306
Do you realize that
you might be wasting

19:33.373 --> 19:35.007
four years
of both of our lives

19:35.074 --> 19:37.544
because you can't just say,
"Bye, see ya," right now,

19:37.610 --> 19:40.580
because in this second
that feels weird?

19:40.647 --> 19:44.351
Oh, my God, Louie,
please, I'm begging you,

19:44.417 --> 19:47.754
for the sake of future me
and future you.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.956
You could save
yourself another divorce

19:50.022 --> 19:51.824
and years of false living.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.494
You could just be a man
in this one moment

19:54.561 --> 19:57.530
and say to me, "April,
thank you for helping me."

19:57.597 --> 19:59.366
Y'know,
"Have a good one.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.567
See ya sometime."

20:03.903 --> 20:05.972
Ugh!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.407
Bye!

20:11.177 --> 20:12.445
( door slamming )

20:13.613 --> 20:15.214
( sighing )

20:23.556 --> 20:25.692
Are we after midnight or before
midnight right now--

20:25.758 --> 20:27.694
Before--
it's before midnight.
It's before midnight.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.796
But it's also after
midnight.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.198
It's always before midnight
and it's always after midnight.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.199
That's what the 6:00 a.m.
to 5:00 a.m.--

20:33.266 --> 20:35.101
the thing
I don't understand.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.537
It's 24 hours, so--
Parking a vehicle
is only authorized.

20:37.604 --> 20:41.207
Like, you can't park
a dog or a carrot,

20:41.274 --> 20:43.576
or is it like
parking of vehicles

20:43.643 --> 20:46.579
only authorized vehicles?

20:46.646 --> 20:48.381
And then this
is a green thing,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.149
but you can't tell--
With a line through it.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.518
But it's the line
is straight across.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.487
It's not even--
it's not...

20:54.554 --> 20:56.323
It doesn't--
it doesn't indicate

20:56.389 --> 20:57.724
that you can't do
something.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.392
It's not red.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.793
It's green.
Even if it was red,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.595
I wouldn't know
what the ( bleep ) it means.
