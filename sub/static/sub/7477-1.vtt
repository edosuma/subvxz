WEBVTT

03:30.390 --> 03:32.510
- Honey, I'm home.
- Roger that.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.020
Copy at the boathouse.
Right on time.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.230
Faisil, get your butt in here.
Harry's inside.

03:39.350 --> 03:42.480
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.990
- Hey, were you born in a barn?
- Whorehouse.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.620
All right. You got
your fur-coated razor blade there...

03:56.700 --> 03:59.120
and a bunch of guys with guns.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.250
I'm switching to sub-vocal now.

04:05.710 --> 04:06.800
Check, check.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.720
- Check, check.
- It's talk radio.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.010
- You're on the air.
- Check.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.110
That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

04:36.990 --> 04:40.290
He's at the service door.
He's inside.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.750
Have you seen Khaled yet?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.170
Yep, there he is.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.300
How come billionaires
are always short?

05:35.720 --> 05:37.350
Excuse me.

05:37.350 --> 05:39.180
Thank you.

05:42.770 --> 05:45.020
Colonel! How are you?

05:45.100 --> 05:48.150
- It's so good to see you again.
- Yes, it's been a long time.

05:48.230 --> 05:50.320
- Terrific.
- Who was that guy?

05:52.740 --> 05:55.030
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

05:56.160 --> 06:00.200
You should be crossing the main foyer,
heading for the stairs.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.170
Keep moving. Keep moving.

06:18.390 --> 06:22.060
I'm in the library, heading out
to the second-floor balcony.

07:16.490 --> 07:20.660
Modem in place.
Transmitting now.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.030
Affirmatory.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.950
It's a good hook-up.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.960
These are encrypted files.
It's going to take me a few minutes.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.960
I got your password.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.630
- Magnificent, isn't it?
- Yes, quite.

08:16.710 --> 08:20.340
I thought I knew Khaled's friends,
but I don't believe I've met you before.

08:20.430 --> 08:23.180
We haven't met,
because I certainly would remember.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.640
Renquist, Harry Renquist.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.520
-Juno Skinner.
-Juno Skinner.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.230
Come on!

08:33.860 --> 08:35.780
"Juno Skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer...

08:35.860 --> 08:38.320
specializing in ancient Persia."

08:38.400 --> 08:41.110
This is Persian,
if I'm not mistaken.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.240
Very good.
Sixth century BC, to be exact.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.960
- Do you like the period?
- I adore it.

08:57.380 --> 09:01.380
We got a problem.
Guards are going ape shit down there.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.510
Acquired most of these pieces
for Jamal.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.640
Do you tango?

09:08.140 --> 09:09.430
Tango?

09:09.430 --> 09:13.350
Harty, you do not have time
to tango, buddy.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.440
You copy?

10:02.950 --> 10:06.030
Don't be stopping to smell
the roses now. You hear me?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.330
- You gotta get out of there.
- Yes! Files are unlocked!

10:09.450 --> 10:12.080
Fast Faisil strikes again.
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.790
I got my hand up her dress,
and I am going for the gold...

10:14.790 --> 10:16.710
Just copy the goddam files, okay?

10:46.450 --> 10:49.370
Wow. And I thought
this was just gonna be...

10:49.370 --> 10:52.580
another bunch of boring bankers
and oil billionaires.

10:52.790 --> 10:55.500
Seconds count.
Ditch the bitch.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.040
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.130
I have a plane to catch.

11:03.300 --> 11:07.300
Well, call me sometime.

11:07.550 --> 11:09.890
My offices are in Rome.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.760
I would like that.

11:18.350 --> 11:22.690
Son of a bitch is with her two minutes,
and she's ready to bear his children.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.190
Twinkle toes,
what's your exit strategy?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.570
I'm going to walk
right out of the front gate.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.200
Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.

11:36.540 --> 11:40.250
Sir, may I see
your invitation, please?

11:40.330 --> 11:43.170
Sure. Here is my invitation.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.680
Shit. Here we go.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.350
Slight change in plans.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.910
Stay!

12:34.060 --> 12:36.220
We're en route to
the lower rendezvous point.

12:36.310 --> 12:37.980
Repeat, back-up rendezvous point!

12:39.560 --> 12:43.440
- Watch it!
- It's called ice, and it's slick.

13:00.870 --> 13:03.710
- Harry, do you copy? Whoa!
- I got it.

13:05.420 --> 13:06.170
Shit!

13:07.550 --> 13:08.670
Whoops!

13:54.050 --> 13:55.640
Oh, my God!

13:55.720 --> 13:57.810
Whoa! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

14:00.350 --> 14:01.560
- There he is!
- Shit!

14:02.640 --> 14:04.730
Hi, guys.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.690
That worked good.
Right out the old front gate.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.740
Can you lean back a second?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.870
Let's go.
We can still make our flight.

14:28.750 --> 14:33.220
All right, that's it
for Mr. Renquist. Okay, go.

14:33.300 --> 14:38.930
We got Harry Tasker billfold,
Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub.

14:39.060 --> 14:42.310
Hotel bill, Tasker.
I got two postcards here from Geneva.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.230
Got some house keys right there...

14:46.310 --> 14:49.770
and I've got a souvenir
Swiss snowing village.

14:49.860 --> 14:52.150
- What's that for?
- It's for Dana, stupe.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.610
Bring your kid home a gift,
the dad thing.

14:54.700 --> 14:55.820
Nice touch.

14:55.910 --> 14:59.580
- Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.
- Will do.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.620
The debriefing is at 1000.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.830
- See you at 8:00. Bye.
- Hey, Harry.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.250
Did you forget something?

15:11.630 --> 15:14.050
What a team.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.430
Sleep fast, buddy.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.590
Hi, honey. How was your flight?

16:00.050 --> 16:02.390
- It was fine.
- Good.

16:16.860 --> 16:20.910
Brought you a little gift
from Switzerland. Snowy village.

16:20.990 --> 16:23.830
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

16:23.870 --> 16:26.370
- I've never had one of these.
- You're welcome.

16:26.450 --> 16:28.540
You're late for school.
You better get going.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.710
- Don't forget to feed Gizmo.
- Okay.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.420
It's pretty lame.

16:40.970 --> 16:42.850
- I'm late.
- Yeah, me too.

16:42.930 --> 16:46.390
How'd it go at the convention?
Make all the other salesmen jealous?

16:46.470 --> 16:49.230
It was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

16:49.350 --> 16:51.980
You should have been there.
We were the big hit of the show.

16:52.060 --> 16:55.610
With that new model ordering system,
the 680 I told you about...

16:55.690 --> 16:57.990
I can write up an order
and immediately...

16:58.070 --> 17:01.780
as soon as the customer's name comes up,
you see what his credit line is...

17:01.860 --> 17:05.330
what he has ordered in the past,
what discount he has gotten.

17:05.410 --> 17:08.080
- Every little detail.
- Sounds great.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.920
It's fantastic. That's why
I love the computer business.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Listen, the plumber called.

17:13.080 --> 17:17.590
He says he has to dig under the slab
or something that's gonna cost $600.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.260
- That's okay.
- It's not okay. It's extortion.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.340
What did you tell him?

17:23.430 --> 17:26.850
I slept with him and
he said he'd knock off $100.

17:26.930 --> 17:29.390
That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.810
Hello!

18:05.800 --> 18:08.810
Boy, I remember the first time
I got shot out of a cannon.

18:08.810 --> 18:12.060
- Good morning. Go to school.
- Yeah, I am.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.860
Thanks, dear.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.610
Check these out.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.150
Check them out.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.570
Where's the image coming from?

18:23.820 --> 18:27.580
Got a CCD camera and a transmitter
in a pack of smokes out there.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.540
It's pretty cool, huh?

18:32.540 --> 18:34.080
What the hell?

18:40.460 --> 18:42.590
Bye, Dad!

18:43.670 --> 18:46.890
- She's ripping you off.
- I knew it.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.560
Let's go!

18:53.730 --> 18:55.980
Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad!

18:56.520 --> 18:58.360
God. Shit.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.900
Kids. Ten seconds of joy,
30 years of misery.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.860
I got married three times, but at least
I was never dumb enough to have any.

19:06.860 --> 19:10.410
She shouldn't be stealing.
I taught her better than that.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.580
You're not her parents any more,
you and Helen.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.710
Her parents are
Axl Rose and Madonna.

19:14.830 --> 19:18.630
Five minutes a day you spend with her
can't compete with that bombardment.

19:18.630 --> 19:20.250
You're outgunned, Daddy-o.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.590
It's not just
because you're a bad parent.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.970
Kids today are ten years ahead
of where we were at the same age.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.180
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr. Tasker.

19:28.390 --> 19:30.510
- I bet you think she's still a virgin.
- Don't be ridiculous.

19:30.510 --> 19:32.680
- She's only... What is she now?
- She's 14.

19:32.770 --> 19:36.060
- She's only 14.
- Her hormones are going like an alarm.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.230
It's even money she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.190
- Not Dana.
- "Not Dana."

19:40.190 --> 19:43.110
Denial. It's not just a river
in Egypt no more, is it?

19:43.110 --> 19:45.530
She's probably stealing the money
to pay for an abortion.

19:45.530 --> 19:48.280
Why don't you open the door?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.200
Or drugs.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.210
Twenty here, 50 there. I figured
my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

19:56.210 --> 19:59.460
He takes everything else. There's
never a beer in the goddam fridge.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.920
- Thought you moved out.
- I had to move back in.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.920
My lawyer said it'd give me
a better shot at getting the house...

20:05.090 --> 20:07.590
during the property settlement,
but don't change the subject.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.640
- You still owe me 200 bucks.
- Good morning, Janice.

20:17.310 --> 20:21.860
- Good morning.
- Identify yourselves to the scanner.

20:21.860 --> 20:25.860
- Harry Tasker, 10024.
- Albert Gibson, 34991.

20:38.660 --> 20:43.290
All right, Frances. I don't believe
we need you any longer now. Thank you.

20:53.220 --> 20:57.480
Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed
the pooch last night, didn't you?

20:57.680 --> 21:02.610
Would you please tell me how I can see
this as anything but a total disaster?

21:02.610 --> 21:05.110
"Total" is a strong word.

21:05.110 --> 21:07.240
There are different
degrees of totality.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.610
It's a scale, really, with
a perfect mission on one end...

21:10.860 --> 21:13.870
and then a total pooch screw
on the other, and we're more on this...

21:14.160 --> 21:17.450
Faisil, you're new on Harry's team,
aren't you?

21:18.500 --> 21:19.830
Yes.

21:19.830 --> 21:25.380
So what makes you think the slack
I cut him in any way translates to you?

21:26.420 --> 21:28.590
Let me show you what we got.

21:31.090 --> 21:35.100
Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty,
so we raid his private financial files.

21:37.310 --> 21:40.310
One hundred million in wire transfers
from the Commerce Bank International.

21:40.310 --> 21:43.270
Which is a front for certain countries
to finance terrorist activities.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.150
That's why we think
something really big is going down.

21:46.190 --> 21:48.400
We know that a week ago
four MIRV warheads were smuggled...

21:48.400 --> 21:50.360
out of the former
Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.700
We think Khaled's group bought the nukes
and is trying to bring them to US soil.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.950
So far this is not
blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.750
Don't you have anything
remotely substantial?

22:01.870 --> 22:05.000
Harry, do you have any hard data?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.630
- Nothing you would call rock-hard.
- Actually it's pretty limp, sir.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.210
Then perhaps you better get some...

22:10.420 --> 22:12.970
before somebody parks an automobile
in front of the White House...

22:12.970 --> 22:16.100
with a nuclear weapon in the trunk.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.640
It's not like
he's saving the world or anything.

22:18.890 --> 22:21.390
He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake.

22:21.390 --> 22:24.350
Whenever I can't sleep,
I ask him to tell me about his day.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.900
Six seconds and I'm out.

22:27.020 --> 22:29.980
He acts like he's curing cancer
or something.

22:30.030 --> 22:32.280
I guess this means you didn't
get away for the weekend after all.

22:32.610 --> 22:35.110
- Harry had to go out of town.
- I'm shocked.

22:35.110 --> 22:37.330
Yeah, well, you know Harry.

22:39.910 --> 22:43.160
- What's up?
- Check this out.

22:43.160 --> 22:47.340
There's a $2 million disbursement
from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.550
That's right.
The babe at the party.

22:51.960 --> 22:55.300
That doesn't mean anything.
She buys antiquities for Khaled.

22:55.380 --> 22:58.720
He keeps his antique buys
on a completely separate ledger.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.350
This is a little above market rate
for the horizontal bop...

23:01.430 --> 23:03.810
even for a total biscuit
like her.

23:03.890 --> 23:06.230
I want a complete work up on her.

23:06.310 --> 23:09.150
- Do we know where she is?
- Right here in River City.

23:09.270 --> 23:11.980
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff
for the Smithsonian.

23:12.070 --> 23:15.150
She has a lot of diplomatic connections,
so she has offices here.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.700
I guess it's time
to send in a specialist.

23:19.330 --> 23:22.370
- Care to tango?
- Yes, I would.

23:26.710 --> 23:28.460
Assholes.

23:32.760 --> 23:37.090
It's all set up. You got a fax machine,
ghost phones, all the usual stuff.

23:37.180 --> 23:41.010
You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel
under the name of Renquist.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.220
Reality check. Let's go.

23:43.310 --> 23:47.810
My name is Harry Renquist. I own
an art consulting firm in San Francisco.

23:47.980 --> 23:50.020
I have an appointment
with Miss Skinner.

23:50.110 --> 23:52.280
- Harry!
- Hello.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.820
Hello.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.950
I thought I'd see you again.
I just didn't know it would be so soon.

23:57.070 --> 24:00.120
- What's the point of waiting?
- I agree.

24:02.660 --> 24:06.830
Your clients are looking for something
for the lobby of their new headquarters?

24:06.910 --> 24:09.080
They would like to see something
very dramatic.

24:09.170 --> 24:11.170
That's a nice piece.

24:11.290 --> 24:15.170
I talked to a number of people,
and they all said you're the one to see.

24:15.340 --> 24:18.300
Really? Checking on me.

24:18.470 --> 24:22.430
So what did these people
say about me exactly?

24:22.560 --> 24:26.980
That you can read ancient Sanskrit
without having to sound out the words...

24:27.060 --> 24:31.400
and other art dealers and archaeologists
don't like you very much.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.150
Those wimps.

24:34.230 --> 24:38.450
It's because I use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures...

24:38.530 --> 24:41.620
from countries which tell them
to take a hike.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.790
Most of our pieces
come from ancient Persia.

24:49.870 --> 24:54.880
Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet
under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.720
Not the most popular places
lately.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.720
So I've had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.

25:06.220 --> 25:07.560
Well, Mr. Renquist?

25:09.140 --> 25:11.940
Do you see anything you like?

25:12.020 --> 25:14.230
Maybe.

25:14.360 --> 25:18.280
Give me a break. I don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.450
She's importing stuff
from all over the Mideast.

25:20.570 --> 25:22.410
She could be moving
money, guns, anything.

25:22.570 --> 25:24.740
The second you left, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers.

25:24.830 --> 25:26.830
They were checking out
the Renquist front.

25:26.910 --> 25:29.710
Let's step up the surveillance
and put on two more guys.

25:29.750 --> 25:33.790
Maurizio, I said Saturday,
not Tuesday. Saturday.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.260
Miss Skinner, may I have
a word with you, please?

25:51.350 --> 25:55.020
Stupid, undisciplined bitch.

25:55.110 --> 25:58.190
It's a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.

25:59.320 --> 26:03.450
Do you realize there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now?

26:03.530 --> 26:05.830
Your telephones are
almost certainly tapped.

26:05.910 --> 26:10.370
And you were busy laughing and flirting
like a whore with this Renquist...

26:10.500 --> 26:12.710
He checked out okay...

26:13.540 --> 26:16.090
We do not tolerate mistakes.

26:20.670 --> 26:22.720
What would you like me to do?

26:22.800 --> 26:25.180
Find out where this Renquist is.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.310
Hello, Tektel Systems.
Mr. Tasker's office.

26:28.390 --> 26:31.020
Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen.
Is he in?

26:31.100 --> 26:34.730
Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs. Tasker.
Let me try him in there. Hold, please.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.020
Relay, 10024.

26:39.610 --> 26:42.150
It's a patch from Tektel.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.860
It's Helen.

26:44.950 --> 26:47.660
Hello, honey. How are you?
What's going on?

26:47.740 --> 26:50.410
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
in the middle of a meeting.

26:50.490 --> 26:53.370
It's just that Dana and I want to make
sure you were gonna be home by 8:00.

26:53.460 --> 26:55.750
We're going to a lot of trouble
for your big birthday.

26:55.830 --> 26:59.550
We just wanted to make sure
that you were gonna be home.

26:59.630 --> 27:01.840
Absolutely.
This time you can count on me.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.260
- Promise?
- Trust me.

27:03.340 --> 27:05.130
- Great.
- Got to go. Bye.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.180
Bye.

27:06.260 --> 27:09.470
- That's disgusting, Dana.
- Calm down.

27:11.930 --> 27:15.900
We got a friend.
Three cars back on the inside lane.

27:16.020 --> 27:19.320
They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.400
- You mean the station wagon?
- Yes.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.530
- You want me to lose them?
- No. We need this lead.

27:25.610 --> 27:26.610
Unit Seven?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.450
Seven here.

27:29.530 --> 27:32.080
We need you at the Georgetown Mall
in three minutes.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.620
- Copy. We're rolling.
- Helen's gonna be pissed.

27:36.290 --> 27:38.710
This is the problem with terrorists.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.840
They're really inconsiderate
when it comes to people's schedules.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.480
Pull over here. This is good.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.280
- Okay, testing, one, two, three.
- I got you. I got you. I got you.

28:06.570 --> 28:09.070
They're right with us.
I make three of them in the car.

28:20.710 --> 28:23.170
- Dick head.
- Blow me.

28:39.690 --> 28:42.020
I got a couple of them getting out
of the car and coming after you.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.900
Think I'm blind?

28:43.980 --> 28:47.990
You do look like Ray Charles.
So what's the plan?

28:48.070 --> 28:50.700
Just trying to get a closer look
at Beavis and Butt-head.

28:50.780 --> 28:54.200
- There's a third one still in the car.
- Stay on him.

29:16.470 --> 29:19.850
Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib.
Oh, not much.

29:19.940 --> 29:23.190
Listen, Harry forgot something
back at the office.

29:23.270 --> 29:26.530
You know Harry.

29:26.610 --> 29:30.110
Yeah, Gib, I know Harry. Bye.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.570
Bye. See you soon.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.410
See?

30:17.030 --> 30:18.490
I lost the third guy.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.330
Shit!

31:04.250 --> 31:08.290
Shit! Hold it! Shit!

31:58.430 --> 32:01.100
Here. Cool off.

33:18.930 --> 33:21.550
Sorry about this.

33:27.350 --> 33:28.980
Look out! Get out of the way!

33:34.900 --> 33:36.900
Hey! Freeze!

33:45.700 --> 33:47.620
Oh, thank God.

34:05.050 --> 34:07.100
Get in the car.

34:12.810 --> 34:14.270
Here we go.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.340
Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.140
Sorry.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.110
- Harry, what's your 20?
- Westbound in the park.

35:02.190 --> 35:04.910
Suspect is on a motorcycle,
and he's coming out on Franklin.

35:04.990 --> 35:05.660
Copy!

35:05.740 --> 35:08.700
I want you on 14th
in case he turns south.

35:08.780 --> 35:11.580
I want Seven on the north side
to box him in.

35:13.540 --> 35:16.500
Make it quick, because
my horse is getting tired.

35:17.290 --> 35:18.460
Your horse?

35:35.310 --> 35:38.060
- There he is! That's him!
- Come on!

35:51.660 --> 35:54.870
- Go around to the back.
- Copy that.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.670
Out of my way!

36:09.600 --> 36:12.310
Out of my way!

36:13.470 --> 36:14.850
Sorry.

36:15.430 --> 36:16.810
Excuse me.

36:26.530 --> 36:28.320
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.620
Open it!

36:34.040 --> 36:36.620
Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:48.970 --> 36:49.970
Out of the way!

36:57.850 --> 36:59.520
Move! Move! Move!

37:03.020 --> 37:05.280
Federal officer! Get down! Now!
Get off or die!

37:07.030 --> 37:08.490
- Get down! Now!
- Move!

37:11.160 --> 37:13.330
Turn around! Hold still!

37:13.330 --> 37:15.290
Come on!

37:21.630 --> 37:22.920
Whoa!

37:28.630 --> 37:30.800
Hold still!

37:41.980 --> 37:44.070
Will you press the button
for the top floor, please?

37:45.780 --> 37:47.190
Thank you.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.450
Help!

37:53.450 --> 37:55.280
Shut up!

37:57.500 --> 37:58.580
Whoa.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.540
Say something.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.880
That's a fine animal.

38:22.520 --> 38:25.020
Stay against the glass!

38:26.020 --> 38:27.280
Come on.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.150
So sorry.

38:32.820 --> 38:35.410
Stay there! Don't move!

38:58.560 --> 39:00.470
Come on, come on, come on!

39:52.190 --> 39:55.400
Okay, back up.

39:55.450 --> 39:56.860
Back up.

40:00.450 --> 40:03.750
You can do it.
Come on.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.540
Good horse. Good.

40:05.540 --> 40:08.080
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now.

40:08.290 --> 40:10.460
Come on.
Yeah, that's teamwork now.

40:10.460 --> 40:12.800
Keep pulling. Come on.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.760
A little bit more.

40:17.890 --> 40:19.300
That a boy.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.180
Okay.

40:36.030 --> 40:38.200
What the hell were you thinking?

40:39.030 --> 40:42.700
I had the guy,
and you let him get away.

40:42.700 --> 40:46.750
Look at me when I talk to you.
What kind of a cop are you anyway?

41:07.140 --> 41:08.690
Hi, honey.

41:12.730 --> 41:16.110
I know you're upset.
I'm sorry.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.910
I hurried home
as fast as I could.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.910
It's okay.

41:26.290 --> 41:28.040
It's okay.

41:29.670 --> 41:31.670
I'm sorry.

41:31.670 --> 41:34.000
Thank you for the party.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.590
Yeah, it was great.

41:51.020 --> 41:52.610
Hey.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.320
That's him.

41:57.360 --> 42:01.450
- Pause it right there.
- Salim Abu Aziz.

42:01.610 --> 42:04.200
This guy is really hard-core.
Highly fanatical.

42:04.450 --> 42:07.790
The man's a real psycho. He's been
linked to dozens of car bombings.

42:08.040 --> 42:11.830
You know that cafe bomb
in Rome last year? That was his.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.710
As well as a 727 out of Lisbon.
This guy's a major player.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.340
Now he's formed his own splinter faction
called Crimson Jihad.

42:19.590 --> 42:23.260
I guess he thought the other terrorists
were too warm and fuzzy for him.

42:23.470 --> 42:26.140
- They call him the Sand Spider.
- Why?

42:26.140 --> 42:28.430
Probably because it sounds scary.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.060
This is impressive, gentlemen.

42:31.190 --> 42:35.190
It would be even more impressive
if you actually knew where he was.

42:35.980 --> 42:37.070
We'll get him.

42:37.610 --> 42:41.450
- Why don't you pull over here?
- What's up?

42:41.450 --> 42:44.660
I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

42:46.950 --> 42:52.000
I'm going to see if she's available
for lunch to smooth things over.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.750
- You just want me to hang?
- Just hang.

42:54.750 --> 42:56.250
I'll just be hanging.

43:02.470 --> 43:03.840
Hold, please.

43:06.010 --> 43:08.760
- It's your mystery man on two.
- Simon?

43:10.850 --> 43:12.140
Oh, my God.

43:16.650 --> 43:17.980
Hello? Simon?

43:18.230 --> 43:19.730
Simon?

43:20.740 --> 43:22.450
Yes, I can talk.

43:25.490 --> 43:28.160
You mean right now?

43:28.160 --> 43:30.490
Yes, I can meet you.

43:31.250 --> 43:34.040
Okay, I can't wait.

43:34.040 --> 43:34.960
Bye.

43:35.920 --> 43:38.040
Can you cover me for an hour?

43:38.090 --> 43:40.670
Just an hour? You should tell
that stud to take more time.

43:40.920 --> 43:44.590
Would you shut up?
I should have never told you about him.

43:47.680 --> 43:48.850
Have a good time.

43:50.350 --> 43:52.640
Get a little bit for me
while you're at it.

44:02.570 --> 44:05.070
Hey! Hold it! Fucker!

44:05.200 --> 44:07.240
What's going on? Sick?

44:07.240 --> 44:09.870
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

44:09.870 --> 44:14.290
It's Hel... It's Helen...
It's Helen.

44:14.290 --> 44:16.670
It has something to do with Helen,
I'm guessing.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.380
Helen...

44:22.380 --> 44:24.420
is having an affair.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.600
Welcome to the club, man.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.350
It can't be. Not Helen.

44:33.350 --> 44:35.560
Nobody thinks it could happen to them
the first time.

44:35.730 --> 44:38.520
Same thing happened to me
with wife number two, remember?

44:38.560 --> 44:42.150
I had no idea nothing was going on.
I come home, and the house is empty.

44:42.190 --> 44:45.820
She even took the ice cube trays
out of the freezer.

44:45.860 --> 44:51.240
What kind of a sick bitch takes
the ice cube trays out of the freezer?

44:52.410 --> 44:56.290
- It's not Helen.
- Helen still loves you.

44:56.290 --> 45:00.040
She just wants to bang this guy
for a while. It's nothing serious.

45:00.040 --> 45:03.550
- You'll get used to it soon
- Stop cheering me up!

45:06.670 --> 45:08.550
What'd you expect?

45:08.760 --> 45:11.050
Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.

45:11.890 --> 45:14.020
It was just a matter of time.

45:21.020 --> 45:23.570
I say we concentrate on work.

45:23.570 --> 45:26.150
That's what I do every time
my life turns to dog shit.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.240
I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.910
Right, buddy?
It's gonna be great.

45:30.910 --> 45:33.450
We're gonna catch some terrorists.
We're gonna beat the crap out of them.

45:33.450 --> 45:35.790
You're going to feel a hell
of a lot better.

45:35.790 --> 45:38.870
Watch your head.
Okay. All right.

45:45.920 --> 45:49.430
Women. Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.

46:06.940 --> 46:09.070
I came by your office today.

46:10.320 --> 46:13.160
I was in the area, and I thought
you might want to have lunch.

46:14.660 --> 46:18.200
Really? Well,
you must have just missed me.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.080
That's what they said. They said
you had to run out or something.

46:22.250 --> 46:25.000
It was this rush job

46:25.090 --> 46:29.260
They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

46:29.340 --> 46:32.590
So, of course, the big problem...
our printer shut down.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.640
So I went to the third floor
to use theirs, but they have the 1720.

46:36.720 --> 46:40.430
Of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1720.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.350
So I had to go back upstairs
and reformat...

46:43.440 --> 46:45.860
go back downstairs
and use their printer.

46:45.940 --> 46:48.610
By the time I got there,
I couldn't get my car to start.

46:48.730 --> 46:51.780
Then traffic...
I barely got there.

46:56.490 --> 46:59.750
So a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

46:59.830 --> 47:01.460
Did it work out okay?

47:03.330 --> 47:05.330
Yeah. Great.

47:07.170 --> 47:09.260
I'll check on dessert.

47:09.340 --> 47:11.380
I'm done.

47:16.930 --> 47:20.220
The great thing is that he's practically
given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.

47:20.350 --> 47:23.310
I set them up on all of Juno's
shipping agents and her clients.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.520
Faisil's made a list
of all the possible contacts...

47:25.610 --> 47:27.610
the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

47:27.690 --> 47:29.940
Now all we have
to do is sit around...

47:33.570 --> 47:36.990
Hey. This national security stuff
boring you?

47:37.070 --> 47:40.540
- Put a tap on her phone.
- What? I already did that.

47:40.700 --> 47:44.920
I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap
on her office line and the house. Now.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.790
Come over here for a second.
That sounds great.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.760
I want to ask you about something.
I got two words to describe that idea...

47:50.880 --> 47:54.050
In-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's
a felony. You know that.

47:54.130 --> 47:58.180
And you're doing it 20 times a day,
so don't give me that crap.

47:58.260 --> 47:59.680
Do it.

48:12.110 --> 48:15.450
- Hello?
- Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk?

48:15.530 --> 48:18.030
Yes, go ahead.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.910
I can't talk long. Can you meet me
for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.

48:21.870 --> 48:24.290
I suppose so. Where?

48:24.370 --> 48:29.170
Same place, 1:00.
I have to go now. See you tomorrow.

48:29.250 --> 48:31.590
Remember, I need you.

48:50.900 --> 48:53.820
I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.320
You know... darn it...

48:58.410 --> 49:02.490
I'm going to meet Allison.
We're going to go shopping. Sorry.

49:03.580 --> 49:05.370
No problem.

49:41.570 --> 49:43.990
I think you're going about
this whole thing all wrong.

49:44.080 --> 49:46.200
Women... they like you
to talk to them.

49:46.290 --> 49:48.960
Maybe it's just that you're not
in touch with your feminine side.

49:49.080 --> 49:52.750
I was watching Sally Jessy Raphael...
All right.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.710
I got all the usual stuff here...
a telemetry burst transmitter.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.840
I got a GPS tracker, an audio
transmitter and a power supply.

49:58.930 --> 50:03.010
I've got it sewn into the lining here...
Hey, Harry?

50:03.180 --> 50:06.060
If you need to talk,
speak into the purse.

50:10.770 --> 50:13.860
Here she comes. She's gonna pop out
right in front of us. Watch this.

50:13.940 --> 50:15.730
Bingo.

50:19.900 --> 50:22.240
Looks like she's going
into Chinatown.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.370
She's parking.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.670
Okay, give me audio.

50:46.260 --> 50:48.470
You sure you weren't followed?

50:50.560 --> 50:54.270
No. I kept looking behind me like
you taught me, but I didn't see anyone.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.650
Okay, it's just that things
are a bit hot right now.

50:56.730 --> 51:01.110
If I get a signal,
I may have to leave suddenly.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.610
I understand.

51:07.080 --> 51:10.370
Look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.

51:10.450 --> 51:15.000
I feel bad about bringing you into this,
but you're the only one I can trust.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.460
Were you out on a mission?

51:20.720 --> 51:25.970
We say "op," covert operation.
And this one, well, got a little rough.

51:26.050 --> 51:28.430
- Worse than Cairo?
- Cairo.

51:29.890 --> 51:32.980
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

51:33.060 --> 51:36.230
- The guy's a spook.
- But for whom?

51:36.310 --> 51:38.360
He could be working her
to get to you.

51:39.110 --> 51:42.570
- Did you read the papers yesterday?
- Yes.

51:47.240 --> 51:50.660
Sometimes a story is a mask
for a covert operation.

51:50.790 --> 51:53.330
You see two men killed in a restroom
and two unidentified men...

51:53.410 --> 51:56.040
in a running shootout,
ending at the Marriott?

51:56.210 --> 51:57.750
That was you?

51:57.840 --> 51:59.300
- Me.
- You're very good.

51:59.380 --> 52:00.670
You recognized my style.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.380
You're a natural at this.

52:03.470 --> 52:05.970
The guy's a fake.
He's taking credit for our moves.

52:06.050 --> 52:08.600
- What happened?
- Hardly worth talking about.

52:09.430 --> 52:11.390
Two of them
won't bother me again.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.980
- Unbelievable.
- You chase done?

52:15.060 --> 52:19.020
Something came over me. I had to nail
this guy no matter what the risk.

52:19.110 --> 52:21.860
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple of times, but I...

52:21.940 --> 52:25.530
- I really can't take credit.
- Why not?

52:26.320 --> 52:29.080
It's the training. It shapes you
into a lethal instrument.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.200
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

52:31.290 --> 52:34.410
I'm starting to like this guy.

52:34.500 --> 52:37.920
We still gotta kill him.
That's a given, you know.

53:04.110 --> 53:06.360
The guy is a goddamned
used car salesman.

53:06.450 --> 53:09.160
This keeps getting better and better!

53:10.580 --> 53:13.080
I'm sorry.
I know this has gotta be painful.

53:13.160 --> 53:15.960
But you gotta admit it's funny.
If it was just some idiot, not you...

53:16.040 --> 53:18.330
you'd be laughing your ass off.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.500
One born every minute.

53:22.590 --> 53:26.420
It wants you too.
Feel it vibrate?

53:26.510 --> 53:29.140
- Say, how about a little spin?
- Sure.

53:31.600 --> 53:34.560
See, it's not just a car.
It's a total image. An identity.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.560
You have to go for it.
This isn't some high-tech sports car.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.440
To tell you the truth,
it doesn't even handle that great.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.610
But that's not the idea, is it?

53:42.690 --> 53:45.610
What are we talking about here?
Pussy, right?

53:47.360 --> 53:49.490
Absolutely.

53:52.580 --> 53:55.870
Let's face it.
The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

53:55.950 --> 53:58.210
But it's not enough.

53:59.370 --> 54:02.710
If you really want to close escrow,
you gotta have an angle.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.760
I suppose you have an angle.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.630
It's killer.

54:07.760 --> 54:10.760
I mean, look at me.
I'm not that much to look at.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.970
No, no, no.
I can be honest.

54:13.050 --> 54:16.600
But I got 'em lining up,
and not just the skanks either.

54:16.680 --> 54:18.730
- Well, some are.
- What's your angle?

54:20.600 --> 54:23.440
No, sorry. Trade secret.

54:23.520 --> 54:26.480
Okay, just ask yourself:

54:26.570 --> 54:28.570
What do women really want?

54:28.650 --> 54:31.450
You take these bored housewives
married to the same guy for years.

54:31.530 --> 54:33.620
They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release.

54:33.700 --> 54:36.290
The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

54:37.330 --> 54:39.500
I create that for them.

54:39.580 --> 54:42.040
So basically you're lying
your ass off the whole time.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.170
- I couldn't do that.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?

54:45.250 --> 54:47.210
Think of it as playing a role.
It's fantasy.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.300
You gotta work on their dreams...

54:49.420 --> 54:53.090
get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.

54:53.180 --> 54:55.260
- What about their husbands?
- Dickless!

54:55.350 --> 54:58.640
I mean, let's face it.
If they took care of business...

54:58.720 --> 55:01.230
I'd be out of business,
you know what I mean?

55:01.310 --> 55:03.270
Those idiots.

55:05.770 --> 55:07.860
You mind keeping it under 90?

55:07.940 --> 55:10.440
I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

55:10.530 --> 55:12.780
So, who are you
working on right now?

55:12.910 --> 55:15.030
I always got a couple on the hook.

55:15.120 --> 55:18.580
There's this one right now,
I got her panting like a dog.

55:18.660 --> 55:20.910
- It's great.
- What does she do?

55:21.040 --> 55:23.750
Some sort of legal secretary
or something.

55:23.830 --> 55:26.420
You know,
uptight and conservative.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.750
But she could be so hot
if she wanted to be.

55:28.840 --> 55:31.170
And with you,
she gets to be real hot.

55:31.260 --> 55:33.720
Red hot!
Her thighs steam.

55:33.800 --> 55:36.550
It's like a dying plant.
Just needs a little water.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.390
- Married to some boring jerk.
- Some boring jerk?

55:39.470 --> 55:42.980
He doesn't appreciate her.
She's like all these babes.

55:43.060 --> 55:46.310
You get their pilot lit,
they can suck-start a leaf-blower.

55:47.440 --> 55:51.070
She's got the most incredible body,
and a pair of titties...

55:51.150 --> 55:53.780
make you want to stand up
and beg for buttermilk.

55:53.860 --> 55:55.910
Ass like a ten-year-old boy.

56:03.160 --> 56:06.460
So, then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?

56:06.540 --> 56:08.540
Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.100
See?

56:23.140 --> 56:26.560
You and this car were made
for each other. Why fight it?

56:26.650 --> 56:30.070
Sure, I got a couple other buyers
on the line, but I like your style.

56:30.190 --> 56:32.280
So, what do you say?

56:32.360 --> 56:34.780
Should we start up
the paperwork?

56:34.860 --> 56:36.740
Let me think about it.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.870
Hold it for me for a day, okay?

56:40.790 --> 56:43.200
Hey, because it's you.

56:43.830 --> 56:46.370
I got today's transcripts.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
Not much going on.

56:50.250 --> 56:52.550
- Nothing from Simon?
- No.

57:04.890 --> 57:06.890
- My turn to drive?
- Give me the page.

57:06.980 --> 57:08.940
- What?
- This jumped from page 9 to 11.

57:09.020 --> 57:10.980
- Where's page 10?
- It's gotta be a typo.

57:11.070 --> 57:13.070
Give me the goddam page!

57:22.830 --> 57:25.660
- Seek help, Harry.
- Hello?

57:25.750 --> 57:29.580
Helen, I need your help.
Can you meet me tonight?

57:29.670 --> 57:31.630
- What's happened?
- It's serious.

57:31.710 --> 57:33.920
Meet me on K Street...

57:34.010 --> 57:36.340
under the Key Bridge,
8:00 sharp.

57:39.010 --> 57:40.180
Gotcha.

57:41.180 --> 57:44.470
Shit. It's almost 8:00.

57:50.730 --> 57:52.940
She's still at the house.

57:53.020 --> 57:55.070
The purse is still at the house.

57:55.150 --> 57:56.690
Shit.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.910
Unit Two, Unit Seven,
immediate roll.

58:00.990 --> 58:03.700
Acquire subject
at K Street and Key Bridge.

58:03.780 --> 58:07.370
Vehicle is red and white convertible.
You got exactly six minutes.

58:07.460 --> 58:10.210
Wait a minute.
Are you out of your mind?

58:10.290 --> 58:13.790
You can't pull agents off a priority
surveillance to follow your wife.

58:13.880 --> 58:18.170
That's a misappropriation of resources
and a breach of national security.

58:18.300 --> 58:20.800
You copy?
You're losing it big-time, man.

58:20.890 --> 58:23.680
- I have to stop you.
- What are you gonna do, tell?

58:23.760 --> 58:26.520
Look, goddam it.
Both of our butts are on the line.

58:26.600 --> 58:30.060
So your life's in the crapper.
Your wife's banging a used car salesman.

58:30.140 --> 58:33.360
It's humiliating, I know,
but take it like a man!

58:33.480 --> 58:36.150
- You tell on me, I tell on you.
- What are you talking about?

58:36.230 --> 58:39.110
I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.
I'm as clean as...

58:39.200 --> 58:41.160
What about when you blew
a six-week operation...

58:41.240 --> 58:44.240
because you were busy
getting a blow-job?

58:44.330 --> 58:46.490
You knew about that?

58:48.370 --> 58:50.370
Let's take Franklin.
It's quicker.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.990
Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

59:29.410 --> 59:31.660
Two here.
Suspect vehicle in sight.

59:31.750 --> 59:33.790
One male, one female.

59:33.870 --> 59:36.540
Now, don't be alarmed.

59:36.630 --> 59:39.340
If I'm spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.

59:39.420 --> 59:41.720
You should keep your head down
till we're out of the city.

59:44.300 --> 59:46.850
Here, let me help you.

59:47.720 --> 59:49.390
That's better.

59:54.190 --> 59:56.310
Now the woman has her head
in the guy's lap.

59:56.400 --> 59:59.440
South bound on the Key Bridge.
Two in pursuit.

59:59.530 --> 1:00:02.900
Roger, Two.
One to Condor, you got a visual?

1:00:05.070 --> 1:00:07.410
Roger, One. This is Condor.
Subject is in sight.

1:00:07.490 --> 1:00:09.620
Repeat. We have the ball.

1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:12.750
We got a pretty good lockup
on infrared.

1:00:12.830 --> 1:00:15.880
She's got her head
in the guy's lap, all right.

1:00:17.130 --> 1:00:19.670
Maybe she's sleepy.

1:00:23.590 --> 1:00:25.550
This is a safe house.

1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:28.390
My place in the city
is a little too hot right now.

1:00:28.510 --> 1:00:30.510
So is the penthouse in New York.

1:00:44.070 --> 1:00:46.110
What is it exactly
you need me to do?

1:00:48.450 --> 1:00:50.580
I want you to be my wife.

1:00:50.660 --> 1:00:52.660
But I'm married!

1:00:52.750 --> 1:00:57.170
It's just for the operation in Paris.
I need to be married.

1:00:57.250 --> 1:00:59.250
They'll be looking for a man
travelling alone.

1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:02.340
You want me to go to Paris?

1:01:02.420 --> 1:01:04.970
Paris, with a quick stopover
in London.

1:01:09.510 --> 1:01:12.180
There's a double agent in my outfit.
I don't know who.

1:01:14.390 --> 1:01:16.850
There's no one I can trust,
except you.

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:18.940
Can you get away,
just for a couple of days?

1:01:19.020 --> 1:01:21.020
I just don't know.

1:01:21.110 --> 1:01:23.440
Of course. I'm rushing you.
Forgive me.

1:01:23.570 --> 1:01:25.950
Sit down.
Make your self comfortable.

1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:30.450
Let me pour you some more wine.

1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:49.760
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1:01:50.890 --> 1:01:54.430
You just saved my life.

1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:57.390
You are incredibly brave.

1:01:57.480 --> 1:02:01.270
I have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.

1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:03.940
You see, for me
fear is not an option.

1:02:04.070 --> 1:02:08.110
Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:11.450
we have to look like two people who are
completely intimate with each other.

1:02:11.530 --> 1:02:13.530
The enemy can spot a fake easily.

1:02:18.750 --> 1:02:20.830
- You see what I mean?
- Sorry.

1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:22.920
That reaction could
get us both killed.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.460
- I'm sorry.
- We can't afford that.

1:02:26.590 --> 1:02:28.260
Try to relax.

1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:30.300
It's just been a long time...

1:02:30.470 --> 1:02:32.890
since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

1:02:32.970 --> 1:02:35.510
- It's a little difficult.
- I know.

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:38.390
- It's awkward for me too.
- I'm sorry.

1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:41.770
- That's all right. Just sit back.
- I'm okay.

1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:44.480
There. That's better.

1:02:45.780 --> 1:02:49.490
Just let yourself
slip into the role.

1:02:57.950 --> 1:03:00.710
That's it.

1:03:00.790 --> 1:03:02.830
There you go.

1:03:04.340 --> 1:03:07.090
Just let yourself go.

1:03:07.170 --> 1:03:08.590
That's good.

1:03:08.670 --> 1:03:10.470
That's great.

1:03:11.630 --> 1:03:12.970
That's it.

1:03:13.050 --> 1:03:15.600
No, I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:18.520
- What's wrong? It's okay.
- I cannot do this.

1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:20.060
I cannot do this!

1:03:24.270 --> 1:03:26.860
If not for me...

1:03:26.940 --> 1:03:28.940
do it for your country?

1:03:58.850 --> 1:04:01.230
Oh, God!
Don't hurt me!

1:04:01.350 --> 1:04:03.270
I'll do whatever you want!

1:04:04.690 --> 1:04:06.610
Please!
I didn't do anything!

1:04:15.740 --> 1:04:17.280
Damn it!

1:04:38.470 --> 1:04:42.060
Take her! Take her!
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:49.320
Son of a bitch!

1:05:40.070 --> 1:05:42.200
Sit down.

1:05:44.750 --> 1:05:47.290
I said sit down.

1:05:51.460 --> 1:05:53.960
Who do you work for?

1:05:55.800 --> 1:06:00.390
Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krumpnick.

1:06:00.510 --> 1:06:03.890
- I'm just a legal secretary.
- Sure, Mrs. Tasker.

1:06:03.970 --> 1:06:06.560
What were you doing
with the international terrorist...

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.810
Carlos the Jackal,
taking dictation?

1:06:08.900 --> 1:06:11.690
How long have you been
a member of his faction?

1:06:11.770 --> 1:06:13.770
I don't know anything
about a faction.

1:06:16.070 --> 1:06:18.860
I just met Simon...

1:06:18.950 --> 1:06:21.620
or whoever you say he is...

1:06:21.780 --> 1:06:23.700
just a couple weeks ago.

1:06:23.830 --> 1:06:25.450
I barely know him.

1:06:25.540 --> 1:06:27.580
That's not what it looked like
when we found you.

1:06:29.290 --> 1:06:31.920
How did you meet him?

1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:35.420
Well...

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:49.390
Keep this for me.
I can't afford to be taken with it.

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.190
- What?
- It's a matter of national security.

1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:56.610
Please, it's important.
I'll contact you.

1:06:56.690 --> 1:06:58.690
Oh, shit.

1:07:30.690 --> 1:07:33.190
Why did you continue
to see him?

1:07:33.270 --> 1:07:35.360
He said he needed my help.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:37.900
Not because you were
attracted to him?

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:42.320
You were not attracted
to him at all?

1:07:49.450 --> 1:07:52.000
Well, maybe just a little.

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:55.500
- So, is cheating a common thing for you?
- Never.

1:07:55.590 --> 1:07:58.750
So you're telling me
this was your first time?

1:07:58.840 --> 1:08:01.470
I wasn't cheating!

1:08:01.550 --> 1:08:03.840
Tell me about your husband,
Mrs. Tasker.

1:08:11.850 --> 1:08:14.480
What can I say about Harry?

1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:16.690
He's a sales rep
for a computer company.

1:08:16.770 --> 1:08:20.780
So sex with him isn't exactly
waving your flag any more?

1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:24.530
That is none of your goddam business!
What kind of questions are these?

1:08:24.610 --> 1:08:27.280
You're in a lot of trouble,
so I suggest you cooperate.

1:08:27.370 --> 1:08:29.870
If we want to know the most
intimate details about your life...

1:08:29.990 --> 1:08:32.290
you'd better tell us.

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:37.040
My husband is a good man.

1:08:37.210 --> 1:08:40.170
But he's not exactly ringing
your bell these days, is he?

1:08:40.300 --> 1:08:44.510
Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

1:08:44.590 --> 1:08:47.550
Why did you go
to Carlos' hideout?

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:50.560
He wanted me to go to Paris with him
on a mission...

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:54.310
to pose as his wife.

1:08:54.390 --> 1:08:56.350
And you agreed?

1:08:58.690 --> 1:09:00.440
Why?

1:09:01.690 --> 1:09:04.570
I don't know.

1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:07.070
I guess I needed something.

1:09:07.950 --> 1:09:09.580
What did you need?

1:09:15.790 --> 1:09:18.500
I needed to feel alive.

1:09:21.210 --> 1:09:24.420
I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

1:09:28.510 --> 1:09:31.890
And it felt really good...

1:09:31.970 --> 1:09:33.980
to be needed.

1:09:38.060 --> 1:09:40.060
And to be trusted.

1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:46.360
And to be special.

1:09:46.450 --> 1:09:48.360
It's just that there's...

1:09:48.490 --> 1:09:50.620
so much I wanted to do
with this life...

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:53.200
and it's like
I haven't done any of it.

1:09:53.290 --> 1:09:56.160
And the sand's running out
of the hourglass...

1:09:56.250 --> 1:09:59.040
and I wanted to be able
to look back and say...

1:09:59.130 --> 1:10:01.670
"See? I did that!

1:10:01.790 --> 1:10:05.720
I was reckless and I was wild
and I fucking did it!"

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:13.810
Quite frankly,
I don't give a shit...

1:10:13.930 --> 1:10:16.140
whether you understand that or not.

1:10:18.850 --> 1:10:20.270
This Simon...

1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.650
did you sleep with him?

1:10:26.820 --> 1:10:28.860
- No.
- She's lying.

1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:33.830
You did not have
sexual relations with him?

1:10:36.370 --> 1:10:39.500
Listen, if you're gonna ask me
every question twice...

1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:43.420
this is gonna take a really long time,
and I have to get back to my family.

1:10:43.590 --> 1:10:46.010
You're not going anywhere, lady.

1:10:46.090 --> 1:10:49.050
Just let me out of here!

1:10:49.130 --> 1:10:50.930
Answer the question.

1:10:52.930 --> 1:10:55.890
- Answer the question!
- No!

1:10:55.970 --> 1:10:59.140
I did not...

1:10:59.230 --> 1:11:02.060
sleep with him!

1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:03.770
Calm down, please.

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:07.190
You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:10.070
- Calm down.
- She could be telling the truth.

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:12.490
Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.

1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:16.290
Calm down, please.

1:11:19.410 --> 1:11:23.460
I've only one more question,
Mrs. Tasker.

1:11:23.460 --> 1:11:24.670
What?

1:11:27.090 --> 1:11:30.590
Do you still love your husband?

1:11:36.810 --> 1:11:39.980
Yes, I love him.

1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:42.850
I've always loved him...

1:11:42.940 --> 1:11:45.230
and I will always love him.

1:11:50.900 --> 1:11:53.410
She loves you.
Now what?

1:11:57.540 --> 1:12:00.580
There's only one solution
to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:02.710
You must work for us.

1:12:04.830 --> 1:12:06.840
What are you doing?

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:09.420
-Just giving her a little assignment.
- You gotta be shitting me!

1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:12.840
She wants a little adventure,
so I'm gonna give her one.

1:12:13.010 --> 1:12:16.010
I'm offering you a choice.

1:12:16.140 --> 1:12:18.430
If you work for us,
we will drop the charges...

1:12:18.430 --> 1:12:20.930
and you can go back
to your normal life.

1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:24.020
If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:28.730
and your husband and daughter
will be left humiliated and alone.

1:12:28.770 --> 1:12:31.070
Your life will be destroyed.

1:12:34.740 --> 1:12:38.410
Gee. Let me think.

1:12:38.410 --> 1:12:40.790
Yes or no?

1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:43.040
Of course yes.

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:44.960
What's involved?

1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:47.460
You will be contacted
with the assignment.

1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:50.630
The code name of your contact
will be Boris.

1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:53.760
Your code name will be...

1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:56.260
- Natasha?
- No.

1:12:57.970 --> 1:12:59.140
Doris.

1:13:11.020 --> 1:13:15.370
Pricks!

1:13:21.910 --> 1:13:25.040
You son of a bitch. Did you think
you could elude us forever, Carlos?

1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.880
Wait! You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.380
Just let me go.
There's no need to kill me.

1:13:31.380 --> 1:13:33.880
I haven't seen your face...

1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:36.010
Don't! I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:42.180
It's you!

1:13:42.310 --> 1:13:44.680
Hey, you still interested
in that 'Vette at all?

1:13:44.810 --> 1:13:46.890
Hey, Carlos.
The game's over.

1:13:46.890 --> 1:13:49.110
Your career as an international
terrorist is well documented.

1:13:49.110 --> 1:13:50.610
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

1:13:50.690 --> 1:13:53.230
I sell cars.
That's all!

1:13:53.230 --> 1:13:56.070
Come on.
I'm not a terrorist.

1:13:56.150 --> 1:14:00.450
I'm actually a complete coward.
If I ever saw a gun I'd... Oh, God!

1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:03.410
Oh, please, don't!
Don't kill me!

1:14:05.710 --> 1:14:08.540
I'm not a spy.

1:14:08.540 --> 1:14:12.340
I'm nothing!
I'm navel lint!

1:14:12.550 --> 1:14:17.800
I have to lie to women to get laid.
And I don't score much.

1:14:18.630 --> 1:14:22.010
I got a little dick.
It's pathetic.

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:25.140
Oh, God.

1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:30.400
Would a spy pee himself?
Huh?

1:14:32.110 --> 1:14:34.400
Please, I'm not worth a bullet.

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:38.070
- Have mercy, sir.
- Get the fuck out of here.

1:14:38.150 --> 1:14:40.070
Just beat it.
Go on.

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:44.290
As soon as I turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

1:14:44.290 --> 1:14:46.160
You're gonna shoot me!

1:14:46.370 --> 1:14:49.500
Please! You can have
the car for free.

1:14:49.540 --> 1:14:51.500
What do you say, huh?

1:14:53.090 --> 1:14:54.750
Get lost, dipshit.

1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:17.570
So last night must've been
pretty exciting for you.

1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:23.660
My flat tire?

1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:25.870
Actually, it was a little scary...

1:15:25.950 --> 1:15:29.040
because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

1:15:36.170 --> 1:15:37.760
I'll get it.

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:41.300
Hello?

1:15:41.430 --> 1:15:42.890
Doris?

1:15:47.310 --> 1:15:49.180
Yes?

1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:52.650
Listen carefully.

1:15:52.650 --> 1:15:55.690
In exactly one hour,
go to the Hotel Marquis.

1:15:56.770 --> 1:15:59.690
Pick up an envelope marked "Doris"
at the front desk...

1:15:59.690 --> 1:16:01.780
- and dress sexy.
- What?

1:16:05.580 --> 1:16:08.740
No, no.
Turn around.

1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:11.870
Do it doucement.

1:16:11.870 --> 1:16:13.790
Do it very slowly.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.090
You've reached a new
all-time low.

1:16:16.090 --> 1:16:18.380
I can't believe you're crazy enough
to use the suite at the Marquis.

1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:21.970
Do you think I can afford
a suite like this on my salary?

1:16:22.090 --> 1:16:24.050
- Is Jean-Claude done yet?
- Hang on.

1:16:24.260 --> 1:16:26.260
Who wrote this shit? Harry?

1:16:29.310 --> 1:16:31.020
It's going great.

1:16:44.570 --> 1:16:46.950
Do you have an envelope for Doris?

1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:05.760
This is Doris.

1:17:05.890 --> 1:17:09.680
Listen, you are
a prostitute named Michelle.

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:12.600
Go to the room.
There will be a man there.

1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:15.230
He is a suspected arms dealer.

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:17.100
Now, wait a minute.

1:17:17.190 --> 1:17:21.070
You don't expect me to, uh,
you know.

1:17:21.110 --> 1:17:24.240
No. He has particular tastes.

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:27.410
He likes to watch.

1:17:27.490 --> 1:17:32.330
Tell him that his regular girl,
Carla, is sick.

1:17:32.450 --> 1:17:34.960
If he likes you,
he will tell you what to do.

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:37.170
You must plant the bug...

1:17:37.290 --> 1:17:40.630
near the telephone by the bed
before you leave.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:43.550
If you do not
complete your mission...

1:17:43.590 --> 1:17:45.550
the deal is off.

1:17:47.130 --> 1:17:49.350
I'm gonna go to hell.

1:20:06.020 --> 1:20:08.030
Have some champagne.

1:20:22.620 --> 1:20:24.080
Come in here.

1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:46.560
My name is Michelle.

1:20:46.690 --> 1:20:48.690
Carla thought you'd like me.

1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:50.860
Let me do the talking.

1:20:50.990 --> 1:20:53.700
You may start by
unzipping your dress.

1:20:56.990 --> 1:21:00.660
No, no. Turn around.

1:21:00.660 --> 1:21:04.830
Do it doucement.
Do it very slowly.

1:21:11.380 --> 1:21:13.050
Good.

1:21:14.090 --> 1:21:17.050
Now slip the dress down slowly.

1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:30.270
Good.

1:21:36.780 --> 1:21:39.200
Now slide your nylons off
one by one.

1:21:41.830 --> 1:21:43.290
I'm not wearing any.

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:45.410
That's good.

1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:50.040
Now, dance for me.

1:21:56.970 --> 1:21:58.840
Dance sexy.

1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:03.560
Let your hands be your lover's hands
on your own skin as you move.

1:24:10.810 --> 1:24:13.520
Now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.

1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:22.450
I thought you only
liked to watch.

1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:30.960
Now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.

1:25:55.830 --> 1:25:57.540
You pig!

1:25:58.460 --> 1:25:59.920
Bastard!

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:13.470
Wait, wait, wait.

1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:23.360
Yes, it's Harry. I know it looks bad,
but I can explain.

1:26:24.820 --> 1:26:27.450
Nobody move!

1:26:27.450 --> 1:26:30.070
Don't move!

1:26:31.370 --> 1:26:33.660
Helen, just don't do anything.

1:26:33.790 --> 1:26:37.120
No, he has nothing to do with it!
I'm the one you want!

1:26:37.250 --> 1:26:38.500
Shut up!

1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:40.920
Quiet, Helen.
Do what they say.

1:26:43.340 --> 1:26:46.470
Come on, guys, let the hooker go.
She's not important.

1:26:46.470 --> 1:26:48.130
You don't need her.

1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:50.800
Harry, please,
just let me handle this.

1:26:50.890 --> 1:26:52.560
Shut up!

1:26:54.060 --> 1:26:56.480
What were you doing there?

1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:00.020
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Talk again and I'll kill you!

1:27:40.900 --> 1:27:43.860
I wish I could say
it's nice to see you again.

1:27:43.940 --> 1:27:45.940
You know her?

1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:51.280
You know, this shade's
totally wrong for you.

1:27:51.410 --> 1:27:53.490
So who's your little friend?

1:27:53.490 --> 1:27:57.500
I'm Helen Tasker.
Harry is my husband. And you are?

1:27:57.580 --> 1:27:59.790
So now it's Tasker,
not Renquist.

1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:05.670
She's just some wacko hooker
I met down at the bar.

1:28:05.670 --> 1:28:08.920
What is the matter with you?
Just tell her the truth!

1:28:09.050 --> 1:28:11.680
We are married,
and we have a daughter.

1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:13.890
I don't know what
the crazy bitch is on.

1:28:13.890 --> 1:28:17.640
You should cut her loose
so we can get down to business.

1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:19.980
Where did I get this then, huh?

1:28:20.060 --> 1:28:22.060
Where did I get this?

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:31.950
Something before takeoff?

1:28:31.950 --> 1:28:34.700
That hurt, you b...

1:28:39.290 --> 1:28:42.460
She was telling the truth,
wasn't she?

1:28:42.540 --> 1:28:44.540
She really doesn't know.

1:28:47.090 --> 1:28:48.750
How interesting.

1:29:37.930 --> 1:29:39.310
Bring them.

1:29:47.810 --> 1:29:49.770
Incredible, aren't they?

1:29:51.360 --> 1:29:54.320
I call them the Four Horsemen.

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:57.450
They're warrior figures...

1:29:57.450 --> 1:30:00.830
from the Persian Empire
of Darius l...

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:02.910
around 500 BC.

1:30:05.670 --> 1:30:07.750
They're absolutely priceless.

1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:11.750
Pity.

1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:35.900
Wait, wait!

1:30:36.950 --> 1:30:38.320
Open it.

1:31:08.190 --> 1:31:10.150
Do you know what this is?

1:31:12.230 --> 1:31:14.150
I know what this is.

1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:19.360
This is an espresso machine.

1:31:23.410 --> 1:31:25.950
It's a snow cone maker.
That's what it is.

1:31:30.250 --> 1:31:32.250
Is it a water heater?

1:31:36.170 --> 1:31:38.510
Do you know why
you've been brought here?

1:31:38.590 --> 1:31:41.180
So that this man
can verify to the world...

1:31:41.260 --> 1:31:44.310
the Crimson Jihad
is now a nuclear power.

1:31:46.350 --> 1:31:50.230
How can he do that?
He's just a salesman, for Christ's sake.

1:31:54.860 --> 1:31:58.570
If I'm wrong about him,
the last thing you'll see...

1:31:58.650 --> 1:32:01.360
will be your blood
spraying across his face.

1:32:07.910 --> 1:32:12.250
It's a Soviet MIRV-6
from an SS-22 air launch vehicle.

1:32:12.330 --> 1:32:15.960
The warhead contains
14.5 kilograms of enriched uranium...

1:32:16.050 --> 1:32:17.920
and a plutonium trigger.

1:32:18.050 --> 1:32:19.970
The nominal yield is 30 kilotons.

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:38.030
What can I say?
I'm a spy.

1:32:46.910 --> 1:32:49.950
You bastard!
You lying son of a bitch!

1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:53.330
- Sorry, honey.
- Don't you call me honey!

1:32:53.420 --> 1:32:55.460
You don't ever get
to call me honey again!

1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:57.590
You understand me, you pig?

1:32:57.670 --> 1:33:00.800
And I can verify that
they have the arming box...

1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:03.720
and all the equipment necessary...

1:33:03.800 --> 1:33:06.390
to detonate all four warheads.

1:33:15.350 --> 1:33:19.030
You have killed our women
and our children...

1:33:19.110 --> 1:33:22.530
bombed our cities from afar
like cowards...

1:33:22.650 --> 1:33:26.700
and you dare
to call us terrorists?

1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:29.580
Now the oppressed
have been given a mighty sword...

1:33:29.700 --> 1:33:33.540
with which to strike back
at their enemies.

1:33:33.620 --> 1:33:35.500
Unless you, America...

1:33:35.580 --> 1:33:38.210
pulls all military forces
out of the Persian Gulf area...

1:33:38.290 --> 1:33:40.630
immediately and forever...

1:33:40.710 --> 1:33:43.670
the Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:46.800
on one major U.S. city each week...

1:33:46.890 --> 1:33:49.350
until our demands are met.

1:33:49.430 --> 1:33:53.730
First, we will detonate one weapon
on this uninhabited island...

1:33:53.810 --> 1:33:56.810
as a demonstration of our power...

1:33:56.900 --> 1:34:01.110
and Crimson Jihad's willingness
to be humanitarian.

1:34:01.230 --> 1:34:04.740
However, if these demands
are not met...

1:34:04.820 --> 1:34:07.450
Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

1:34:07.570 --> 1:34:11.120
on one major American city
each week

1:34:13.500 --> 1:34:15.210
Battery.

1:34:22.380 --> 1:34:24.670
Get another one, you moron.

1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:28.390
I think I have one in the truck.

1:34:30.350 --> 1:34:32.310
- What?
- Look at this.

1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:37.480
- That's not mine.
- Nice transmitter.

1:34:39.230 --> 1:34:42.440
Miami Tower,
Jet Star 6479 Delta on final.

1:34:42.530 --> 1:34:44.570
- We'll be on the ground in 12 minutes.
- All right.

1:34:44.650 --> 1:34:47.360
Tell those D.E.A. boys
to have the helos...

1:34:47.450 --> 1:34:49.530
hot and ready to fly
in 12 minutes.

1:34:49.620 --> 1:34:53.700
Signal's definitely stopped moving.
It's an island in the Keys.

1:34:58.620 --> 1:35:00.880
- We lost the signal.
- Shit!

1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:22.860
All right, everyone.
This is Samir.

1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:27.650
For 50 points,
see if you can guess his specialty.

1:35:27.740 --> 1:35:29.610
No hygiene?

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:34.080
- Not exactly.
- What's going on?

1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:36.830
Samir's just gonna ask Harry
a few questions.

1:35:36.910 --> 1:35:40.370
We're not even sure
which agency Harry works for.

1:35:40.460 --> 1:35:42.670
Now, Samir's absolutely first-class.

1:35:42.750 --> 1:35:46.590
On the other hand we have Harry,
who's managed to lie convincingly...

1:35:46.670 --> 1:35:49.430
to the woman he loves for 15 years.

1:35:49.510 --> 1:35:53.510
So it'll be interesting to see
how long he can resist.

1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.600
This will help.

1:35:56.930 --> 1:35:59.730
You know, you should
swab that with alcohol.

1:35:59.810 --> 1:36:01.810
I might get an infection.

1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:06.780
I'll return when
this has taken effect.

1:36:06.860 --> 1:36:09.570
Then we'll talk.

1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:12.200
I'm looking forward to it.

1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:15.200
Now, why are you helping
these raving psychotics?

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:18.790
Because they're very well-funded
raving psychotics...

1:36:18.870 --> 1:36:21.460
and I'm getting a lot of money.

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.420
What, you think I care
about their cause?

1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:30.090
Or yours?
Not at all.

1:36:31.430 --> 1:36:33.390
You're damaged goods, lady.

1:36:40.430 --> 1:36:42.650
Did you tell her about us?

1:36:42.730 --> 1:36:46.150
There is no "us,"
you psychopathic bitch.

1:36:46.230 --> 1:36:48.650
Oh, sure.

1:36:48.730 --> 1:36:50.780
You say that now.

1:36:55.660 --> 1:36:59.250
Thanks for everything.
It wasn't bad while it lasted.

1:36:59.330 --> 1:37:01.500
Let's go.

1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:03.580
You two stay here.

1:37:09.210 --> 1:37:11.220
There was nothing.

1:37:13.180 --> 1:37:14.510
I swear.

1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:40.620
What did they give you?

1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:46.210
Sodium Amytal,
or some other truth agent.

1:37:47.670 --> 1:37:49.670
It makes you tell the truth?

1:37:53.590 --> 1:37:56.180
Is it working?

1:37:56.260 --> 1:37:59.100
Ask me a question
that I normally would lie to.

1:38:01.350 --> 1:38:04.270
- Are we gonna die?
- Yep.

1:38:04.350 --> 1:38:06.650
I'd say it's working.

1:38:06.770 --> 1:38:10.440
They're gonna shoot us in the head,
or they're gonna torture us to death...

1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:12.610
or they're gonna leave us here
and let the bomb...

1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:22.160
How long have you been a spy?

1:38:26.370 --> 1:38:28.420
Seventeen years.

1:38:40.050 --> 1:38:42.310
Have you ever killed anyone?

1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:47.480
Yeah, but they were all bad.

1:39:17.510 --> 1:39:22.890
Is there anything you want to tell me
before we start?

1:39:22.970 --> 1:39:24.390
Yeah.

1:39:24.470 --> 1:39:26.890
I'm going to kill you pretty soon.

1:39:26.980 --> 1:39:29.060
I see.

1:39:30.190 --> 1:39:32.980
How, exactly?

1:39:33.070 --> 1:39:37.320
First, I'm going to use you
as a human shield.

1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:40.110
Then I'm going to kill
this guard over there...

1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:42.740
with the Patterson trocar
on the table.

1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:46.160
And then I was thinking
about breaking your neck.

1:39:48.460 --> 1:39:51.960
And what makes you think
you can do all that?

1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:54.460
You know my handcuffs?

1:39:54.550 --> 1:39:56.300
I picked them.

1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:21.360
Let's get out of here.

1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:13.370
Come on!

1:41:55.370 --> 1:41:57.290
Drop the gun!

1:42:04.220 --> 1:42:06.970
Honey, next time, duck.

1:42:12.390 --> 1:42:15.650
- Let's go.
- I married Rambo.

1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:43.880
What are they doing?

1:43:06.530 --> 1:43:07.200
It is done.

1:43:11.700 --> 1:43:15.500
In 90 minutes,
a pillar of holy fire...

1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:17.710
will light up the skies...

1:43:21.090 --> 1:43:23.170
to show to the world...

1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:25.920
that we speak the truth.

1:43:41.190 --> 1:43:44.030
We are set on our course.

1:43:44.110 --> 1:43:46.320
No force can stop us now.

1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:49.280
We're cool, we're bad-asses,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:52.120
If we're on an island,
why are they using trucks?

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:55.240
We must be in the Florida Keys.

1:43:55.330 --> 1:43:57.910
The overseas highway connects
the islands to the mainland.

1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:01.080
There's no borders, no customs.

1:44:01.130 --> 1:44:04.550
They can go anywhere in the U.S.
There's nothing to stop them.

1:44:05.590 --> 1:44:07.010
Just us.

1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:12.140
- Here, take this.
- Oh, shit.

1:45:38.310 --> 1:45:39.560
Shoot!

1:45:55.570 --> 1:45:57.120
Shit!

1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:58.210
Let's go.

1:49:05.470 --> 1:49:08.850
My condolences to the widow.

1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:27.240
We may need the hostage.

1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:31.870
Okay, let's go, Suzy Homemaker.

1:49:38.380 --> 1:49:40.170
Hurry up!

1:49:40.260 --> 1:49:42.300
Just get her in the car.
Let's get going.

1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:57.750
- I thought this looked like your work.
- Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.

1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:01.500
You're welcome. Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

1:51:01.590 --> 1:51:03.590
Let's go!
Come on!

1:51:25.950 --> 1:51:29.700
Well, you tell that son of a bitch
this is a Bright Boy Alert.

1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:32.370
I repeat:
A Bright Boy Alert.

1:51:32.450 --> 1:51:34.750
This is not a drill.
Do you understand that?

1:51:34.830 --> 1:51:37.750
Hold on.
Put me through to the White House.

1:51:37.830 --> 1:51:42.340
The minimum safe distance is 12 miles.
Get the marine patrol in right away.

1:51:42.420 --> 1:51:44.710
I want the Coast Guard
and the sheriff's department too.

1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:48.340
Anyone that cannot make that distance,
you gotta get 'em out by air.

1:51:48.430 --> 1:51:51.890
You've got exactly 34 minutes.

1:51:51.970 --> 1:51:54.560
I can get you two Marine Corps Harriers
here in 11 minutes.

1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:57.390
- They're on manoeuvres outside Key West.
- Get them.

1:51:57.480 --> 1:52:00.020
- I'll brief them on the way in.
- Send 'em in right away.

1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:13.780
Would you like one?

1:52:20.290 --> 1:52:23.670
I want the state police driving through
the streets on their damn loudspeakers.

1:52:23.750 --> 1:52:25.590
Here they come.

1:52:35.390 --> 1:52:39.350
Lime-Zero-One, got a tally on
three trucks east bound on the bridge.

1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:42.190
Roger, Lime-Zero-One.
You're clear to engage.

1:52:42.270 --> 1:52:45.650
Ringo is padlocked.
In hot with guns.

1:52:45.780 --> 1:52:48.240
Let's get some.

1:53:51.380 --> 1:53:52.840
Okay, marines, time to kick ass.

1:53:52.930 --> 1:53:55.800
Recommend using your Mavericks
to take out the bridge.

1:53:55.930 --> 1:53:59.770
Roger that.
Lime flight, switch Mavericks. Two.

1:53:59.850 --> 1:54:02.230
These missiles won't
set off those nukes, will they?

1:54:02.310 --> 1:54:04.650
That's a negative.

1:54:07.820 --> 1:54:10.280
Fire.

1:54:30.550 --> 1:54:32.550
- Bingo!
- Good shooting, marines.

1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:25.810
I'll kill you!

1:55:43.700 --> 1:55:46.330
- It's out of control.
- Somebody capped the driver.

1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:55.170
Bitch!

1:56:25.580 --> 1:56:28.160
Like one?
How about two?

1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:56.820
Get down to the limo!

1:56:59.860 --> 1:57:02.700
Come on!
Take it down! Let's go!

1:57:03.820 --> 1:57:06.830
- Get down!
- Take it down.

1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:19.220
- The bridge is out!
- What?

1:57:19.300 --> 1:57:22.300
The bridge is out!

1:57:22.390 --> 1:57:24.390
I can't hear you!

1:57:24.510 --> 1:57:26.060
What?

1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:31.890
Oh, God!
The bridge is out!

1:57:34.730 --> 1:57:36.900
Come on! Come on!

1:57:36.980 --> 1:57:39.530
Speed up a little bit, now.
Get down there.

1:57:47.910 --> 1:57:49.540
Come on! Hurry!

1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:51.620
Hurry, Harry!

1:57:51.710 --> 1:57:55.000
- Grab my hand!
- Come back!

1:57:55.080 --> 1:57:58.840
- Okay, to the right.
- I can't reach! Get lower!

1:58:08.850 --> 1:58:11.140
Here we go!
Hold on!

1:58:11.270 --> 1:58:13.310
Hold on really tight!

1:58:17.110 --> 1:58:19.280
Harry! Come back!

1:58:20.110 --> 1:58:21.570
Pull up!

1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:27.030
Grab my hand!
You can do it!

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.450
I can't reach!

1:58:31.700 --> 1:58:34.080
Oh, God! Please!
Harry!

1:58:38.590 --> 1:58:39.960
Oh, shit.

1:58:41.260 --> 1:58:43.130
Come on, baby.

1:58:50.600 --> 1:58:52.060
Hold on!

1:58:52.140 --> 1:58:53.640
I got you!

1:58:53.730 --> 1:58:57.100
- Oh, God!
- Hold on tight!

1:59:30.180 --> 1:59:33.560
Let's get this thing on the ground.

1:59:42.230 --> 1:59:44.280
Let's get these aircraft
on the ground.

1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:47.530
We got a nuclear bomb going off
in about one minute.

1:59:51.330 --> 1:59:53.740
Any minute now.
Go, go, go.

1:59:53.950 --> 1:59:56.500
Come here.
Give me a bullhorn.

1:59:58.830 --> 2:00:00.500
All right, it's show time.

2:00:00.590 --> 2:00:03.420
Do not look at the flash.
Do not look at the flash!

2:00:05.210 --> 2:00:07.300
We should be safe here.

2:00:16.270 --> 2:00:19.020
This is the wrong finger.

2:00:57.520 --> 2:00:58.940
Come here!

2:00:59.980 --> 2:01:01.650
- Go to work.
- Okay. Bye.

2:01:04.570 --> 2:01:08.440
Aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes
ago on top of a high-rise in Miami.

2:01:08.530 --> 2:01:12.240
He rendezvoused with some faction
members. They're on the 20th floor.

2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.700
I got SWAT down there.
The cops cordoned off the area.

2:01:15.830 --> 2:01:18.330
They got a hostage.
It's Dana.

2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:22.460
What do you mean?
My Dana?

2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:24.590
I'm real sorry.
I don't know what to say.

2:01:24.670 --> 2:01:25.960
I guess he grabbed her
in the middle of the night.

2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:28.840
We just found out about it.

2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:31.260
But I don't want you to worry.
We'll get her back.

2:01:31.260 --> 2:01:33.340
I've got a guy on the inside.
Listen.

2:01:33.430 --> 2:01:35.970
We're gonna get her back.
Here we go.

2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:41.730
Excuse me, Captain. I got to
borrow your plane for a minute.

2:01:41.810 --> 2:01:45.900
Listen, Force Comm cleared you
to give us total cooperation, right?

2:01:45.980 --> 2:01:48.940
And you know that comes directly from
the president of these United States.

2:01:49.030 --> 2:01:51.860
But, sir, you're gonna have
to sign for this aircraft.

2:01:51.950 --> 2:01:55.030
I'll sign for it. You got a pen?
You take care of it.

2:01:56.030 --> 2:01:58.200
Do you realize
it has been ten years...

2:01:58.290 --> 2:02:00.290
since you've been behind
the wheel of one of these?

2:02:00.370 --> 2:02:02.790
I break it,
they can take it out of my pay.

2:02:02.870 --> 2:02:05.750
Listen, we got a guy on the inside.

2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:16.050
Gotta move back, everybody!
Let's go!

2:02:31.820 --> 2:02:33.950
All right, everybody,
it's gonna be all right!

2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:38.870
He's got hundreds of hours
in the Harriers there.

2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:47.080
He is a little rusty,
but that's a trademark Tasker takeoff.

2:02:47.170 --> 2:02:50.340
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget, really.

2:02:53.590 --> 2:02:57.090
We might wanna seek shelter!

2:03:00.510 --> 2:03:02.890
Sorry.

2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:04.940
Fuck!

2:03:25.580 --> 2:03:30.420
The streets are filled with people
as police try to evacuate the buildings.

2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:33.260
They appear to be shooting
wildly into the air as I'm speaking.

2:03:33.380 --> 2:03:35.510
These seem to be warning shots.
So far...

2:03:35.590 --> 2:03:37.930
they have not fired at us or police.

2:03:38.140 --> 2:03:40.010
This apparently is the same group...

2:03:40.100 --> 2:03:42.390
which just detonated a nuclear bomb
in the Florida Keys.

2:03:42.470 --> 2:03:46.940
Crimson Jihad will rain fire
on one major U.S. city each week...

2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:50.110
until our demands are met.

2:03:50.190 --> 2:03:54.030
This tape was released to the media
just minutes after the terrorists

2:03:54.110 --> 2:03:57.280
I have to go to the bathroom.

2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:01.530
We'll repeat the tape following
this live report from the scene.

2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:06.910
Hold your fire!

2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.380
- The video crew you wanted is here!
- Send them!

2:04:12.550 --> 2:04:14.920
They're coming in.
They're unarmed.

2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:33.360
Come on. Let's go.

2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:35.230
Go.

2:04:40.660 --> 2:04:44.120
This is a communiqu?
from Crimson Jihad.

2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:47.410
You have seen a demonstration
of our power.

2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.870
Do not force us
to destroy this city...

2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:52.080
and do not try
to use force against us.

2:04:52.170 --> 2:04:55.340
I, we are all prepared to die.

2:04:55.420 --> 2:04:58.510
With one turn of that key...

2:04:58.590 --> 2:05:02.350
two million of your people
will die instantly!

2:05:02.430 --> 2:05:05.260
- What key?
- That key!

2:05:05.350 --> 2:05:07.140
Who's taken the key?

2:05:13.310 --> 2:05:15.230
Shoot her!

2:05:40.510 --> 2:05:42.260
Holy shit!

2:06:14.250 --> 2:06:17.380
Unit One to Unit Seven.
Give me a situation report.

2:06:17.460 --> 2:06:20.420
One to Seven. Give me a sit rep.
Faisil, do you copy?

2:06:21.840 --> 2:06:23.970
Seven here.
21st floor secure.

2:06:24.050 --> 2:06:27.720
About 12 faction members
on the 20th floor. No hostages there.

2:06:27.810 --> 2:06:29.890
- Where's Dana?
- She's on the roof.

2:06:29.970 --> 2:06:35.230
Okay, stay put.
Give me that address again.

2:06:39.230 --> 2:06:40.990
You shoot me, this'll fall!

2:06:43.570 --> 2:06:46.320
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

2:06:50.580 --> 2:06:53.410
- Give me the key!
- I'll drop it, I swear!

2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:00.130
Give me the key.

2:07:00.210 --> 2:07:03.470
Come on, child.
You don't want to die, do you?

2:07:05.760 --> 2:07:09.850
Give me the key
and you won't get hurt.

2:07:09.930 --> 2:07:12.060
I give you my word!

2:07:13.230 --> 2:07:15.390
No way, you wacko!

2:07:20.690 --> 2:07:23.150
Help me!

2:08:13.620 --> 2:08:15.710
Please don't come any closer!

2:08:18.540 --> 2:08:20.250
Help me! Help me!

2:08:20.380 --> 2:08:21.840
Somebody!

2:08:33.890 --> 2:08:35.600
Dana, jump down!

2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:37.140
Jump down!

2:08:37.730 --> 2:08:39.230
Dad?

2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:49.490
Help me!

2:09:24.940 --> 2:09:27.190
Daddy, come back!

2:09:32.030 --> 2:09:41.750
Daddy, get me down!

2:09:38.790 --> 2:09:40.870
Jump! Jump!

2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:42.630
Daddy will catch you!

2:09:42.710 --> 2:09:44.840
-Jump!
- I can't!

2:09:49.220 --> 2:09:50.340
Hold on!

2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:02.400
Don't you let me fall, please!

2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:04.480
- Daddy!
- I got you!

2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:05.690
I'm slipping!

2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:12.280
Help me!
I'm gonna fall!

2:10:18.790 --> 2:10:20.410
Hold my hand!

2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:26.790
Hold on tight, honey.

2:11:21.810 --> 2:11:23.890
He's behind you!

2:11:25.230 --> 2:11:28.650
Take this plane down, now!
I'll kill her!

2:11:28.730 --> 2:11:31.530
Take it down, now!

2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:50.500
My God, do something!

2:11:57.760 --> 2:11:59.720
You're fired.

2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:47.980
It's okay.

2:12:50.770 --> 2:12:52.770
Honey, it's over.

2:13:01.740 --> 2:13:03.370
Hi, pumpkin.

2:13:06.950 --> 2:13:09.000
Just seconds after the jet landed...

2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:12.790
the unidentified pilot was escorted
from the scene by Federal agents.

2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:16.050
Though it is unclear at this moment
which agency was responsible...

2:13:16.130 --> 2:13:18.550
for the operation which ended
the terrorist threat...

2:13:18.670 --> 2:13:20.680
so dramatically
early this morning...

2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:22.760
we've learned from Miami Police...

2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:33.150
Do it properly.

2:13:33.230 --> 2:13:37.650
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

2:13:37.740 --> 2:13:40.820
Five, six, seven, eight,
try to keep your thumbs straight.

2:13:40.910 --> 2:13:42.700
Don't! Stop it!

2:13:42.780 --> 2:13:45.830
- Wait!
- I got you!

2:13:45.910 --> 2:13:48.830
Just listen.
Listen to the rules.

2:13:53.670 --> 2:13:57.050
- Hello?
- Boris and Doris?

2:13:57.130 --> 2:13:58.880
We're on.

2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:02.720
Yes? Go ahead.

2:14:30.330 --> 2:14:32.370
Colonel, how nice to see you again.

2:14:32.460 --> 2:14:34.790
Good evening.

2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:36.710
Who was that?

2:14:45.850 --> 2:14:48.470
What's the scoop, team?
You see your contact yet?

2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:51.890
Haven't seen him yet.

2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:54.730
But I see somebody
I'd like to say hello to.

2:14:54.810 --> 2:14:57.020
Let me pour you
some more champagne.

2:14:57.110 --> 2:14:59.400
I got to keep up the waiter bit.

2:14:59.530 --> 2:15:02.110
These stakeouts can be tricky.

2:15:02.190 --> 2:15:05.620
You never know when things might
explode into a life-or-death situation.

2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:09.080
If it gets rough, stay low until
it's over and I'll contact you later.

2:15:09.160 --> 2:15:13.620
- Maybe you should give me your...
- So, we meet again, Carlos.

2:15:17.130 --> 2:15:19.800
Honey, I'm just gonna
do him right here, okay?

2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:21.420
Go for it.

2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:24.510
Oh, God.

2:15:30.350 --> 2:15:32.350
Fear is not an option.

2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:46.110
Dance?

2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:51.990
- Tango.
- Here we go.

2:16:08.010 --> 2:16:10.430
Harry? Helen? Guys?

2:16:10.510 --> 2:16:13.020
Come on, now.
Let's not get distracted.

2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:15.140
We got some work to do.

2:16:21.270 --> 2:16:23.480
All right, guys.
Come on.

2:16:23.570 --> 2:16:27.570
You guys better get serious in there.
I'd be serious if I was in there.

2:16:29.780 --> 2:16:32.410
Don't ignore me, Harry.
That's rude.

2:16:35.830 --> 2:16:37.870
All right, guys.
Come on.

2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:43.590
National security, guys.
Come on. Life and death.

2:16:52.970 --> 2:16:55.270
Helen, I was always on your side.

2:16:55.350 --> 2:16:57.390
I was always there for you.

2:17:35.850 --> 2:17:39.390
You know what?
I'm sick of being in the van.

2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:42.060
You guys are gonna be
in the van next time.

2:17:42.150 --> 2:17:44.650
I been in the van for 15 years.
