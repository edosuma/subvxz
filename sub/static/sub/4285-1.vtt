00:19.640 --> 00:23.599
In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba,

00:23.680 --> 00:27.434
with the apparent intention
of letting some of his people

00:27.520 --> 00:30.557
join their relatives
in the United States.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.792
Within seventy-two hours, 3,000
U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.997
It soon became evident that Castro
was forcing the boat owners

00:38.080 --> 00:41.152
to carry back with them
not only their relatives

00:41.240 --> 00:43.754
but the dregs of his jails.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.877
Of the 125,000 refugees
that landed in Florida,

00:46.960 --> 00:50.111
an estimated 25,000
had criminal records.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.277
...they are unwilling to adapt
to the spirit of our revolution.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.476
We don't want them!
We don't need them!

01:07.440 --> 01:10.512
MARIEL HARBOUR, CUBA

03:28.480 --> 03:30.198
What do you call yourself?

03:31.920 --> 03:36.471
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?

03:36.760 --> 03:39.752
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.000
And my father,
he was from the United States.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.438
Just like you, you know?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.639
He was a Yankee.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.117
He used to take me a lot
to the movies.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.235
I learned.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.995
I watch the guys
like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.154
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.630
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.309
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.516
Sometime. Somewhere.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.716
Mother?
She dead, too.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.832
What work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.832
I was this, that.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.199
Construction business.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.798
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.918
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.992
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.038
You ever been to jail, Tony?

04:32.120 --> 04:35.669
Me? Jail? No way, no.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.198
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah. On the boat coming over.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.472
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?

04:44.640 --> 04:47.074
<i>You like to dress up like a woman?</i>

04:47.640 --> 04:50.108
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.350
Just answer the questions, Tony.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.551
Okay. No.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.709
<i>Fuck, no.</i>

04:57.280 --> 05:00.431
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

05:00.600 --> 05:02.079
Never, man.
Heroin?

05:02.160 --> 05:04.515
Cocaine?
No.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.397
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

05:10.800 --> 05:13.951
How am I gonna get a scar like that
eating pussy?

05:14.720 --> 05:16.995
This was when I was a kid, you know?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.112
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.349
And this?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.509
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.956
Sweetheart, my ass! We've
been seeing more and more of these.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.589
<i>Some kind of code
these guys used in the can.</i>

05:31.680 --> 05:34.069
<i>Pitchfork means an assassin
or something.</i>

05:34.160 --> 05:35.593
<i>You want to tell us about it...</i>

05:35.680 --> 05:38.513
<i>or you want to take a trip
to the detention centre?</i>

05:40.200 --> 05:42.395
Okay, you got me.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.235
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.510
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.352
It was a Canadian tourist.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.590
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

05:52.680 --> 05:54.875
Come on!
So I fuck up!

05:55.120 --> 05:58.157
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.514
You a Communist?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.633
How'd you like it?

06:03.720 --> 06:07.429
They tell you always what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.830
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.952
I don't have to listen to this!

06:13.040 --> 06:16.919
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!

06:18.320 --> 06:20.231
<i>Do you want a chivato
on every corner...</i>

06:20.320 --> 06:21.753
watching everything you do?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.432
Everything you say, man?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.156
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

06:26.240 --> 06:28.515
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.797
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.799
How'd you like that?

06:34.360 --> 06:36.874
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

06:36.960 --> 06:40.191
<i>I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:43.870
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.039
I want my fucking human rights, now!

06:47.120 --> 06:50.032
Like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?

06:51.200 --> 06:54.078
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.833
- What do you say?
- I don't believe any of this shit!

06:56.920 --> 07:00.959
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.838
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.911
Get him out of here.
Know something?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.035
You can send me anywhere.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.315
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.278
There's nothing you can do to me
that Castro hasn't done...

07:12.360 --> 07:13.634
Get him out of here!

07:16.040 --> 07:18.031
So?
So?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.351
What'd you tell them?

07:20.440 --> 07:24.991
What you told me to tell them.
That we... I was in sanitation.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.798
They didn't go for it.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.110
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.

07:30.360 --> 07:35.559
I told you to tell them you was
in a sanatarium, not sanitation.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.279
- Sanatarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.

07:39.360 --> 07:44.070
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanatarium.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.514
You was cured.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.909
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.195
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

07:57.760 --> 08:02.880
ONE MONTH LATER

08:50.640 --> 08:52.517
Tony! Montana!

08:53.120 --> 08:55.509
Tony Montana! Come here.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.715
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.797
<i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>

09:01.880 --> 09:03.711
So close, man.
Come on.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.040
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?

09:07.120 --> 09:09.270
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.476
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.074
Are you ready for some good news?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.198
Sure. What you got, man?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.271
We can be outta this place
in 30 days.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.750
Not only that, but we got
a green card and a job in Miami.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.030
Now are we made or are we made, man?

09:24.160 --> 09:27.436
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

09:27.520 --> 09:30.080
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.594
- No.
- You're not kidding?

09:33.880 --> 09:36.678
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.875
Rebenga?

09:38.840 --> 09:41.229
- I know that name.
- Yeah?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.833
- He's political.
- Yeah.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.556
Well, he's coming in here
today. Castro just sprung him.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.350
<i>This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.</i>

09:50.760 --> 09:54.833
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.118
<i>But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.</i>

09:58.200 --> 10:01.397
<i>One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.</i>

10:01.480 --> 10:02.879
<i>He wants the favor repaid.</i>

10:03.080 --> 10:04.672
That's where we come in.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.436
It's ugly, man.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.429
Yeah.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.749
You tell your guys in Miami,
your friend...

10:20.360 --> 10:21.998
it'd be a pleasure.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.470
I'd kill a Communist for fun...

10:25.160 --> 10:28.835
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.913
MIAMI, FLORIDA, AUGUST 11, 1980.
HUNDREDS OF CUBAN REFUGEES

10:31.960 --> 10:34.679
BEGAN RIOTING THIS MORNING
AT A DETENTION CENTRE SITUATED

10:34.760 --> 10:37.718
UNDER INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH MIAMI,
BURNING TENTS AND ATTACKING

10:37.800 --> 10:40.951
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
GUARDS WITH PIPES, STICKS AND ROCKS.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.310
<i>Libertad! Libertad!</i>

11:45.280 --> 11:46.759
Rebenga!

12:24.600 --> 12:26.318
From a friend you fucked!

12:56.760 --> 12:58.557
That face. That's nice.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.518
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.

13:36.840 --> 13:37.829
Fuck!

13:42.040 --> 13:44.713
Your big shot friend better
come up with something soon.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.268
I didn't come to the U.S.
To break my fucking back.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.669
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

13:50.560 --> 13:51.754
Fucking thing!

13:52.080 --> 13:53.115
I told you.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.874
What's wrong?

14:10.680 --> 14:11.749
Look at that one.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.274
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.032
<i>Look at those titties.</i>

14:16.720 --> 14:18.438
Look at that punk with her.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.956
What's he got that I don't have?

14:21.840 --> 14:25.037
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.470
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.950
Come on.
That's style, flash, pizzazz.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.952
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.234
Look at this.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.594
Fucking onions.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.998
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.559
There's two guys
looking for you out there.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.670
<i>That's him, man. That's El mono.
I told you.</i>

15:00.760 --> 15:02.398
Don't stay too fucking long.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.789
We've got a lot of work to do.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.551
Waldo! Good to see you, man.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.996
This is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.311
<i>Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.</i>

15:32.680 --> 15:34.113
I got something for you.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.156
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

15:36.240 --> 15:39.596
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.

15:39.720 --> 15:44.032
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.388
$500?

15:49.680 --> 15:52.069
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.993
The going rate on a boat
is $1,000 a night.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.069
You know that.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.868
First you gotta work
your way up to $500.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.394
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.550
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

16:05.640 --> 16:08.108
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.668
<i>What's with this dishwasher, chico?</i>

16:10.840 --> 16:14.230
Don't he know we could've got any
space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

16:14.320 --> 16:16.595
- $50!
- Then why didn't you?

16:16.720 --> 16:19.951
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.632
Who the fuck are you?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.272
You can't do that, man!

16:24.360 --> 16:26.555
The Colombians!

16:30.600 --> 16:32.556
Okay, all right, big man!

16:32.640 --> 16:36.030
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.436
You know something about cocaine?

16:42.720 --> 16:44.312
You kidding me or what?

16:45.640 --> 16:48.074
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.994
<i>New guys. They say they got
two keys for us, for openers.</i>

16:52.080 --> 16:55.959
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.349
If it's what they say,
pay 'em and bring it back.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.431
Do that, you get $5,000.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.316
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.670
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

17:10.760 --> 17:12.796
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

17:12.920 --> 17:16.390
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.396
Be at Hector's Bodega
at noon Friday.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.277
You get the buy money then.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.318
If anything happens
to that buy money...

17:27.400 --> 17:30.039
my boss will stick your heads
up your asses...

17:30.120 --> 17:32.236
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

17:32.320 --> 17:33.719
I'm scared.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.351
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.432
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.919
You'll have a heart attack.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.037
You act like that guy's
doing you a favor or something.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.908
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?

17:50.120 --> 17:53.954
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

17:54.040 --> 17:57.032
I don't like fucking Colombians,
okay?

17:58.240 --> 17:59.593
What you guys doing?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.636
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.392
Wash 'em yourself.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.629
I retire!

18:05.960 --> 18:08.110
What the fuck you gonna do now?

18:08.320 --> 18:11.471
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!

18:11.560 --> 18:14.757
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!

18:29.840 --> 18:32.400
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.756
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.397
Not that one, man! That one!

18:38.480 --> 18:40.436
Which one?
The young one.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.193
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.196
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.714
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

18:51.800 --> 18:56.078
Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
Miami Beach, man!

19:16.920 --> 19:19.070
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.594
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.589
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.951
Room 9. You ready?
Sure thing.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.875
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.030
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.031
Sure. No problem.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.508
No problem.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.598
Hello. This is Marta.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.153
Marta, hello.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.232
I am Hector.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.199
And I am Tony.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.749
So, Omar says you're okay.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.469
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.635
Okay.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.349
So, you got the money?

21:14.800 --> 21:16.074
You got the stuff?

21:16.160 --> 21:19.709
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.392
I got it close by.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.749
I don't have the money either, man.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.397
I have it close by, too.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.395
Where?

21:36.160 --> 21:37.309
In the car?

21:38.440 --> 21:41.238
No, not in the car, man.
No?

21:41.960 --> 21:44.758
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.349
Not far.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.350
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.319
Where you from, Tony?

22:02.400 --> 22:05.597
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

22:06.960 --> 22:08.359
Take it easy, man.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.509
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.957
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.555
Okay?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.638
What's the story?
Tony!

22:29.880 --> 22:33.839
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.909
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?

22:41.600 --> 22:43.511
You want to give me the cash...

22:44.720 --> 22:46.950
or do I kill your brother first...

22:47.760 --> 22:49.273
before I kill you?

22:51.120 --> 22:54.510
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

22:54.960 --> 22:56.757
See if it fits.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.715
Yeah? Okay.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.232
<i>It's very important.
I understand.</i>

23:26.320 --> 23:27.878
<i>Thank you.
You're welcome.</i>

23:27.960 --> 23:29.837
<i>You forecasted an earthquake...</i>

23:29.920 --> 23:32.115
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range
this morning.</i>

23:32.400 --> 23:35.278
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

23:35.360 --> 23:37.351
<i>I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.</i>

23:37.920 --> 23:40.673
<i>However, isn't it
rather slender evidence...</i>

23:51.320 --> 23:53.197
You have such beautiful skin.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.390
I like the way you...

24:01.160 --> 24:03.879
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

24:26.040 --> 24:28.429
<i>Antonio, mira!</i>

24:29.560 --> 24:31.391
Watch what happens to your friend.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.471
If you don't want this
to happen to you...

24:33.560 --> 24:35.039
give me the money.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.513
Come on, come on.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.918
Now the leg.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.116
Let's do it, man. Come on.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.431
We're all gonna be all right.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.957
<i>Okay, cara cicatriz.</i>

25:41.720 --> 25:44.314
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.669
<i>Last chance, pendejo!</i>

25:53.320 --> 25:54.548
Fuck you!

26:59.960 --> 27:02.428
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.231
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

27:15.320 --> 27:17.151
<i>Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.</i>

27:38.520 --> 27:40.954
- Your turn.
- I kill you!

27:41.280 --> 27:42.269
Die!

27:55.320 --> 27:58.835
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

27:59.240 --> 28:00.593
<i>Close the door!</i>

28:12.360 --> 28:15.796
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.436
<i>Yeah, well,
I'll check it out right away.</i>

28:18.520 --> 28:22.513
You do that, Omar. You do that.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.235
<i>You still got the money?
Yeah.</i>

28:26.160 --> 28:28.116
<i>And I got the yeyo.</i>

28:28.760 --> 28:31.274
<i>You got the yeyo?
Yeah, right.</i>

28:31.840 --> 28:33.751
<i>Bring it here.
Fuck you.</i>

28:33.840 --> 28:36.115
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.435
Not you, me.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.799
Nice fucking guy.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.276
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.557
Tony Montana.
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.914
You can call me Frank.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.514
<i>Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.</i>

29:20.640 --> 29:23.074
Even the fucking prosecutors
around town...

29:23.160 --> 29:24.275
they all call me Frank.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.952
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

29:26.040 --> 29:27.917
Manny Ribera.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.555
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.153
We heard about that.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.312
Omar, he tells me great things
about you guys.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.558
Well, Omar's okay.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.677
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

29:41.760 --> 29:45.275
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- You don't have to mention that.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.238
- That was fun.
- That was fun?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.754
- Damn right.
- That was fun.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.712
Sometimes it's fun.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.512
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

29:57.600 --> 30:00.592
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.838
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

30:03.920 --> 30:07.310
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.631
<i>You, Tony, and your compadre here.</i>

30:13.680 --> 30:15.033
Here's the stuff.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.715
Two keys.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.550
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.472
My gift to you.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.030
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.311
If people would do business
the right way...

30:36.400 --> 30:38.868
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.394
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.278
<i>You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business...</i>

30:46.360 --> 30:49.557
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.557
And you'll find out
your biggest problem...

30:58.640 --> 31:00.517
is not bringing in the stuff...

31:00.600 --> 31:03.194
but what to do
with all the fucking cash!

31:04.240 --> 31:06.071
I hope I have that problem someday.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.912
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.877
Sit down over here.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.788
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?

31:15.880 --> 31:18.678
Jesus! Fucking broad.

31:18.760 --> 31:22.753
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.276
Gotta get her in between.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.110
She's coming.
Yeah.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.834
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.751
That's the best time.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.116
What are you guys doing tonight?

31:38.200 --> 31:41.192
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

31:42.160 --> 31:43.309
I could eat a horse.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.312
- Okay, they'll cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.234
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

31:54.320 --> 31:56.595
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.669
It hit the wall.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.955
I ran out of bullets
like an asshole.

32:00.040 --> 32:03.350
<i>When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed...</i>

32:03.440 --> 32:05.510
<i>wasn't dead and shot me.</i>

32:06.080 --> 32:07.911
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.355
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.668
Nine millimeter.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.589
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.797
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.392
Where you going? Come on.

32:31.480 --> 32:35.632
<i>Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.</i>

32:38.040 --> 32:40.156
Tony Montana. Elvira.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.714
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera. Elvira.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.429
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?

32:48.520 --> 32:50.875
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.878
- Again?
- Again.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.157
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you...

32:56.240 --> 32:58.390
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.517
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

33:03.560 --> 33:05.471
I got nothing but friends!

33:05.560 --> 33:09.314
You never know. Maybe the catcher
on your Little League team.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.429
The catcher? That son of a bitch,
he didn't get a base hit all season.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.873
<i>I should kill him!</i>

34:19.000 --> 34:22.150
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.956
They got the biggest distribution
set-up from here to Houston...

34:27.040 --> 34:29.235
Tucson, all down that way.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.032
What do you think of that?

34:33.040 --> 34:34.029
Look.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.429
<i>You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.</i>

34:39.600 --> 34:41.431
<i>El Gordo!</i>

34:41.520 --> 34:44.273
<i>He's got more cash
than anybody in this place.</i>

34:44.400 --> 34:46.868
<i>He's a real chazer!</i>

34:51.000 --> 34:53.355
<i>You know what a chazer is?</i>

34:53.719 --> 34:55.915
<i>No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a chazer?</i>

34:56.000 --> 34:58.468
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

34:58.560 --> 35:03.156
A guy who wants more than he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.

35:03.240 --> 35:08.394
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.390
Lesson Number 1:

35:13.880 --> 35:16.519
Don't underestimate...

35:16.600 --> 35:18.875
the other guy's greed!

35:20.320 --> 35:21.469
Lesson Number 2:

35:21.560 --> 35:23.516
Don't get high on your own supply.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.717
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.234
'Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.357
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.079
That is '64?
The best, Mr. Lopez.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.470
Omar, you pour it, and you bring
another bottle right away, will you?

35:46.520 --> 35:50.513
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

35:50.640 --> 35:54.076
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.

35:56.600 --> 36:00.513
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.758
How you like it, Tony?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.431
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

36:13.520 --> 36:15.954
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!

36:19.040 --> 36:21.713
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.598
I'm gonna get you $550 suits...

36:25.280 --> 36:27.032
so you look real sharp.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.070
'Cause I want you to work for me.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.358
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.715
We are going to do...

36:38.800 --> 36:41.189
something big next month.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.836
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.676
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.869
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.473
You want a cigar?

37:00.400 --> 37:04.393
You wanna dance, Frank,
or sit here and have a heart attack?

37:08.880 --> 37:13.192
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.277
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.509
How about you?

37:28.800 --> 37:30.677
What? You want me to dance?

37:30.760 --> 37:32.716
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.798
Go on. Have some fun.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.872
What do you think of him?

37:50.160 --> 37:52.151
I think he's a fucking peasant!

37:56.400 --> 37:58.914
But you get a guy like that
on your side...

37:59.400 --> 38:01.595
he breaks his back for you.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.550
- What's your name?
- What?

38:32.720 --> 38:35.188
What's your name? Elvira what?

38:35.360 --> 38:37.555
- Hancock.
- What?

38:37.800 --> 38:40.109
- Hancock!
- Hancock?

38:41.720 --> 38:44.598
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.353
Flying around.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.674
Where you from?

38:50.480 --> 38:52.516
- Baltimore.
- What?

38:52.680 --> 38:54.432
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

38:54.920 --> 38:58.515
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, okay?

38:59.640 --> 39:02.108
I'm just trying to be friendly.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.356
I don't need another friend...

39:04.440 --> 39:06.670
especially one
who just got off a banana boat.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.872
Banana boat?

39:10.040 --> 39:13.555
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.475
<i>You're thinking of someone else,
maybe.</i>

39:17.880 --> 39:19.916
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

39:20.000 --> 39:24.152
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.153
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.

39:27.480 --> 39:30.597
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.319
What is your problem, baby?

39:33.480 --> 39:34.629
<i>You're good-looking.</i>

39:34.720 --> 39:36.711
<i>You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs...</i>

39:36.800 --> 39:39.155
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.719
Only you got a look in your eye...

39:40.800 --> 39:43.360
like you haven't been fucked
in a year!

39:44.240 --> 39:45.832
Hey, José.

39:45.920 --> 39:49.071
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

39:49.160 --> 39:52.277
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.

39:52.360 --> 39:55.352
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.474
Not yet,
but you gotta give me some time.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.872
Even if I were blind, desperate...

40:03.960 --> 40:06.190
starved and begging for it
on a desert island...

40:06.280 --> 40:08.555
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.638
That chick he's with...

40:14.280 --> 40:15.793
Yeah?
She likes me.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.717
She likes you? How do you know?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.149
I know.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.557
<i>The eyes, chico. They never lie.</i>

40:29.880 --> 40:33.634
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?

40:33.840 --> 40:36.115
That's the boss's lady, okay?

40:36.200 --> 40:40.318
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.952
That guy's soft.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.399
Look in his face.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.834
<i>The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.</i>

40:54.360 --> 40:56.590
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

40:57.480 --> 41:01.189
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

41:01.280 --> 41:02.599
You remember.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.272
I'd like to forget that.

41:06.040 --> 41:09.396
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.112
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?

41:16.680 --> 41:18.557
<i>The world, chico...</i>

41:19.960 --> 41:21.791
and everything in it.

41:27.760 --> 41:32.197
THREE MONTHS LATER

41:55.960 --> 41:57.439
This is paradise.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.075
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.638
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.429
I should've come here 10 years ago.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.193
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.033
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat...

42:16.120 --> 42:18.429
my own car, my own golf course.

42:18.520 --> 42:21.353
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.998
A line of blue jeans.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.152
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.795
How's that?

42:29.480 --> 42:31.789
That sounds completely crazy to me.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.793
Look at that. Look.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.434
<i>You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.</i>

42:37.520 --> 42:39.476
<i>We're missing the action.</i>

42:41.720 --> 42:44.154
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

42:44.240 --> 42:45.958
Get lost, greaseball!

42:47.040 --> 42:48.712
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.472
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

42:50.560 --> 42:53.632
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on. That won't work.

42:53.720 --> 42:55.597
You can't do it that way.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.478
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

43:02.280 --> 43:05.511
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.311
- That's disgusting.
- Watch.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.119
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.350
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.310
Figures you wouldn't understand.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.472
But the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.

43:19.560 --> 43:22.393
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.715
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.870
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.154
Look at that.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.113
She's looking at us.

43:38.880 --> 43:42.236
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.999
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?

43:46.120 --> 43:49.351
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.998
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.759
I'm with you, man.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.833
I'm gonna get her.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.830
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.669
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

44:09.120 --> 44:12.874
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.031
You want to see something funny?

44:15.120 --> 44:17.156
Take a look over there.
See that man?

44:17.320 --> 44:19.595
<i>Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.</i>

44:19.840 --> 44:20.909
I gotta watch my friend.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.560
He gonna stick his tongue out
to that girl.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.999
Look at that.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.029
You're sick!

44:27.120 --> 44:29.236
You see what happened to him?

44:29.640 --> 44:33.110
- If I wasn't a nice guy...
- She's too big for you.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.078
Causing trouble like that, come on.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.515
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

44:37.600 --> 44:38.953
What I try to tell you?

44:39.040 --> 44:41.838
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.873
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

44:45.960 --> 44:49.032
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.791
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.518
That's the one I rented.

44:54.120 --> 44:57.590
No. That's her, man. There she is.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.189
<i>About time.</i>

45:00.240 --> 45:02.515
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.079
He told me to pick you up.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.188
<i>He said he'd meet us
at the track later.</i>

45:10.080 --> 45:13.231
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.873
In that thing? You must be kidding.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.512
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.192
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.

45:27.920 --> 45:32.436
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.476
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.830
So, you like this better?

45:49.360 --> 45:53.911
It's like one of them tigers
from India.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.957
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?

45:56.040 --> 45:58.759
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

45:58.960 --> 46:00.518
He says he's gonna buy one.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.034
<i>You do that
and you won't have any friends left.</i>

46:03.120 --> 46:06.192
Not that you have any now.
You'll like that tiger, man.

46:06.280 --> 46:09.078
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

46:09.160 --> 46:11.515
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.439
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.

46:17.520 --> 46:20.830
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.838
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.989
Bullet-proof this, okay?

46:28.080 --> 46:30.071
And this here and here.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.474
<i>And the windows.</i>

46:34.920 --> 46:39.311
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- A scrambler.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.755
And a radio with scanners...

46:41.840 --> 46:43.751
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.432
Don't forget the fog lights.

46:45.520 --> 46:49.274
In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

46:52.240 --> 46:55.118
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

46:56.480 --> 46:58.755
I thought you were taking me
to Frank.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.509
We got an hour. You hungry?

47:08.200 --> 47:09.872
No, but I'm bored.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.478
Well, that figures.

47:14.560 --> 47:17.711
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.072
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

47:21.240 --> 47:22.878
Good doing business with you.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.389
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.153
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

47:33.240 --> 47:35.390
Yeah. You know who?

47:37.400 --> 47:39.118
What would Frank say?

47:41.400 --> 47:43.038
I like Frank, you know?

47:43.560 --> 47:45.312
Only I like you better.

47:52.840 --> 47:55.070
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

48:12.600 --> 48:17.196
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.

48:24.440 --> 48:28.115
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

48:28.240 --> 48:29.389
Shit.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.672
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?

48:31.760 --> 48:32.795
No!

48:34.960 --> 48:37.076
Playtime is over, okay?

49:31.960 --> 49:33.188
Mama?

49:36.400 --> 49:37.628
Long time.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.992
No postcards from jail?

49:52.400 --> 49:53.515
Gina.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.953
- Tony?
- Look at you.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.239
You're beautiful.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.559
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.916
Look at that. She looks like me.

50:07.640 --> 50:10.393
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

50:10.480 --> 50:13.836
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.837
I got something for you.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.512
It's no big deal.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.755
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

50:42.840 --> 50:44.876
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

50:44.960 --> 50:46.439
Well, no.

50:50.520 --> 50:55.275
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.115
- For me?
- I think so.

50:59.280 --> 51:02.511
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.759
See what's written on the back?

51:08.840 --> 51:10.114
On the back?

51:11.920 --> 51:15.674
- Always.
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

51:17.160 --> 51:19.196
Mama is still working
in the factory...

51:19.280 --> 51:21.316
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.358
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

51:24.600 --> 51:27.239
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.834
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.912
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.151
- Then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise!

51:36.720 --> 51:39.359
All that's over, starting today.

51:39.760 --> 51:40.749
Why?

51:40.840 --> 51:45.311
My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor, and Mama...

51:45.920 --> 51:48.229
she don't have to sew in no factory.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.556
Your son made it, Mama.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.194
He's a success.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.629
That's why
I didn't come around before.

51:57.520 --> 52:01.274
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.999
Here's $1,000.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.153
For you, Mama.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.796
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

52:17.640 --> 52:19.471
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.469
No?
No.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.317
What are you doing now?

52:24.880 --> 52:27.838
<i>Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?</i>

52:27.920 --> 52:30.070
No! Things are different now.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.879
I'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.798
I'm an organizer now.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.075
I get a lot
of political contributions.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.513
Sure you do.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.718
A gun sticking in somebody's face
is how.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.158
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

52:52.920 --> 52:55.753
is animals like you
and the killings.

52:56.440 --> 52:59.591
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

52:59.680 --> 53:02.877
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

53:02.960 --> 53:04.837
People who send their children
to school.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.558
What are you saying?
That's your son...

53:06.640 --> 53:09.598
Son? I wish I had one.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.389
He's a bum.

53:11.480 --> 53:14.199
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.838
Who do you think you are?

53:20.280 --> 53:23.113
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

53:26.080 --> 53:28.674
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

53:28.760 --> 53:31.115
and think you can get my respect.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.319
You think you can buy me
with jewellery?

53:34.400 --> 53:37.836
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

53:37.920 --> 53:40.309
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

53:40.400 --> 53:44.359
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am, Antonio!

53:44.560 --> 53:46.949
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

53:49.000 --> 53:51.355
You are not going to destroy her.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.632
I don't need your money.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.392
I work for my living.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.388
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

54:01.840 --> 54:03.717
I don't want you around Gina.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.194
So come on. Get out!

54:18.320 --> 54:22.154
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.753
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody?

54:30.280 --> 54:31.872
<i>I'm sorry, Tony.</i>

54:33.560 --> 54:34.879
Okay, Mama.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.433
No. Tony, wait a minute!

54:40.520 --> 54:42.590
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!

54:42.840 --> 54:44.876
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!

54:46.120 --> 54:47.872
Tony, wait, please!

54:48.480 --> 54:52.758
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...

54:52.840 --> 54:54.910
Forget Papa. We never had one.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.554
I know you did some bad things
back then.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.394
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.152
The Communists...

55:02.240 --> 55:04.231
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

55:04.320 --> 55:07.039
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.

55:08.600 --> 55:11.068
I just... I don't know.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.628
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

55:13.920 --> 55:17.629
<i>It doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.</i>

55:19.640 --> 55:22.712
You're my blood, always.

55:23.880 --> 55:24.949
I know.

55:35.040 --> 55:38.112
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.794
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.154
What will I tell her?

55:42.240 --> 55:43.912
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.390
Don't tell her I gave it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

55:47.480 --> 55:49.994
And listen, you go out yourself.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.356
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.590
You gotta get some fun out of life.

55:55.680 --> 55:58.399
You gonna beat yourself to death
at 19?

55:58.480 --> 56:00.869
A pussycat like you? Come here.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.917
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.036
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.553
I'll talk to her.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.753
I'll talk to you.

56:15.800 --> 56:16.835
Let's go.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.990
She's beautiful. How come you...

56:23.640 --> 56:27.519
Stay away from her. You hear?

56:28.280 --> 56:29.554
She's not for you.

56:38.400 --> 56:43.428
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA

56:55.280 --> 56:58.238
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production...

56:58.320 --> 57:02.233
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.830
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

57:04.920 --> 57:08.196
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

57:08.280 --> 57:11.511
who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee...

57:11.600 --> 57:15.639
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.157
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

57:21.200 --> 57:23.430
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

57:23.520 --> 57:26.478
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come...

57:26.560 --> 57:30.951
but with his trial coming up,
it's hard to leave the country.

57:31.040 --> 57:34.316
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.

57:34.400 --> 57:36.550
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

57:37.160 --> 57:40.436
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.995
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me...

58:05.080 --> 58:06.308
every month of the year.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.549
He picks it up here.

58:07.640 --> 58:09.790
I can sell it to him
for as little as...

58:11.640 --> 58:14.950
$7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

58:15.760 --> 58:18.479
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

58:18.680 --> 58:21.513
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

58:21.600 --> 58:23.431
That means we have
to go to war with them.

58:23.520 --> 58:26.557
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.837
Why don't we split the risk?

58:30.440 --> 58:33.830
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama...

58:34.640 --> 58:36.312
we take it from there.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.836
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

58:43.440 --> 58:47.513
Panama I can sell for $13,500 a key.

58:48.720 --> 58:51.154
$13,500? What, are you nuts?

58:52.680 --> 58:56.150
$13,500? We still
got to take that shit to Florida.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.276
<i>Do you know
what that's like these days?</i>

58:58.360 --> 59:00.351
You got the Navy everywhere.

59:00.520 --> 59:04.672
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

59:05.280 --> 59:08.397
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.269
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

59:12.200 --> 59:14.998
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.599
Forget about $13,500.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.639
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

59:28.000 --> 59:29.956
Excuse me. One moment.

59:34.240 --> 59:36.470
What the fuck's the matter with you?

59:36.560 --> 59:38.152
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?

59:38.240 --> 59:40.390
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

59:40.480 --> 59:43.392
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

59:43.960 --> 59:46.679
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

59:46.760 --> 59:48.273
We're doing this one deal.
That's it.

59:48.360 --> 59:50.191
Fuck you. How's that?

59:51.320 --> 59:52.958
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

59:53.080 --> 59:55.719
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

59:55.800 --> 59:58.598
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.831
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.069
<i>Why not talk to him?</i>

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.037
<i>You think he wants
to give you the money?</i>

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.519
Shut the fuck up.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.591
I'm doing the talking here, not you.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.914
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.231
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.719
<i>That's easier to watch.</i>

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.153
Close your mouth.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.637
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.668
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.235
Now where were we?
Panama.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.830
You're looking for a partner, right?

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.639
Something like that.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.076
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.759
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.195
That's my limit. I got no right.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.238
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.914
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.911
You got no authority here.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.673
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.594
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.996
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.919
No, it is all right.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.557
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.389
Well, good.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.672
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.670
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.749
Good.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.789
My associates can escort you
to my chopper...

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.518
<i>to take you to Santa Cruz.</i>

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.558
<i>I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.</i>

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.518
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.075
Good.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.318
Good talking to you.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.356
Why not leave your friend here?

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.113
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.158
- I think Frank wants to see him.
- No, that's okay.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.755
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.879
I guess so.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.752
Let's finish our lunch.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.196
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.670
You got everything a man could want.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.233
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.753
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.310
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.269
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.236
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.435
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.596
He was an informer for the police.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.793
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.959
<i>So how do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?</i>

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.870
Let's get this straight now.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.513
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.079
You got that?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.629
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.991
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.594
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him...

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.113
I never trusted him.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.231
For all I know, he had me set up...

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.595
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.989
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.355
You want to go on with me, say it.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.079
You don't, then you make a move.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.080
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.513
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.471
this Lopez, your boss...

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.233
<i>he had chivatos like that
working for him.</i>

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.678
His judgment stinks.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.991
So I think to myself...

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.278
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.388
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.393
Frank is smart, you know?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.910
You can't blame him for that animal.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.753
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.479
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.433
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank...

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.793
and work it out?

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.517
I'll fix things between us.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.918
You got my word on that.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.233
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.149
we do business together
for a long time.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.354
Just remember...

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.390
I'll only tell you one time...

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.431
don't fuck me, Tony.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.871
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.388
You what?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.876
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million...

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.234
without even checking with me?

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.311
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.118
<i>- Coño. Take it easy.
- Coño, my ass!</i>

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.192
<i>At $10,500 a key. It's puro.</i>

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.910
You can't lose money. No way.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.196
We make $75 million on this deal.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.110
$75 million.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.032
That is serious money.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.072
What is Sosa going to do...

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.355
when I don't come up
with the first $5 million?

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.113
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.510
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.195
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.952
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.917
I make a couple of moves...

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.875
a million here, a million there,
you got it.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.630
You've been making moves
on your own?

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.638
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.118
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.316
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.630
<i>What'll he do
when you start moving 2,000 keys...</i>

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.474
Fuck Gaspar Gomez
and fuck the Diaz brothers!

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.709
<i>Fuck 'em all!</i>

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.710
I'll bury those cockroaches!

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.918
What they ever do for us?

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.278
Look, Frank, the time has come.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.312
We gotta expand.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.833
The whole operation. Distribution.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.992
New York, Chicago, LA.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.353
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.792
We gotta think big now.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.474
Think big.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.878
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.391
Let me tell you something
about that greaseball cocksucker.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.388
He is a snake, that's what he is.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.948
<i>You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.</i>

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.751
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.350
You want me to believe...

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.953
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.919
You bought that line?

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.879
<i>Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.</i>

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:23.158
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:27.475
Like what?

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.993
Like what?

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.595
You tell me, "Like what."

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.073
You calling me a liar, Frank?

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.752
That what you're calling me?

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.115
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.787
You stall your deal with Sosa.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:00.667
Stall it?

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.359
Okay, boss.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.988
Come on.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.549
I am the boss.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.189
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.868
Remember I told you
when you started...

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.429
the guys who last
in this business...

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.395
are the guys who fly straight...

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.073
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.276
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.111
<i>chicas, champagne, flash...</i>

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.399
they don't last.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.068
You finished?

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.109
Can I go now?

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.158
Hi, there.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.758
You just missed Frank.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.869
Too bad.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.151
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.438
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.388
Make an appointment.
That's okay.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.472
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.548
<i>So why don't we have
a couple of drinks...</i>

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.353
<i>act normal...</i>

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.272
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.911
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.751
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.191
We're all normal here.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.349
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.994
That's right.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.550
I think it's easier, don't you?

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.918
Makes things easier.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.429
Thank you.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.756
Here's to "the land of opportunity."

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.159
For you, maybe.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.189
You like kids?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:40.989
Kids?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.750
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.476
Sure. Why not?

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.273
As long as there's a nurse.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.193
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.039
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.236
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.159
Come here.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.909
Sit here.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.911
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.358
Okay, here's the story.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.557
I come from the gutter. I know that.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.432
I got no education...

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.759
but that's okay.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.076
I know the street...

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.549
and I'm making
all the right connections.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.030
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.791
I could go right to the top.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.875
Anyway...

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.790
what I got to tell you is this:

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.359
I like you.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.193
I liked you
the first time I laid eyes on you.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.748
I said, "She's a tiger.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.957
"She'll belong to me."

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.153
Anyway...

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.118
I want you to marry me.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.878
I want you to be
the mother of my children.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.512
Me? Marry you?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.794
That's right.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.992
What about Frank, Tony?

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.193
<i>What will you do about Frank?</i>

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.670
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.388
Just think about it, okay?

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.915
I want you to really think about it.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.318
I'll go now. Take care.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.232
All your enemies are gone.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.148
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.477
What the fuck she doing here?

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.752
Come on, man. She's just
dancing. Come on. Take it easy.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.830
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she's with?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.275
He's some guy who works
for Luco. He's nobody.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.998
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.435
Yeah. Forget him.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.034
Hello, Tony. You remember me?

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.069
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.956
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.394
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.554
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.958
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.078
No, not lately.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.755
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.877
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.436
Whoever's giving you
your information...

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.158
is taking you for a long ride.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.955
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.838
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls...

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.239
here and now?

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.393
Keep your eye on her.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.879
I'll do that.
Okay.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.471
- My office.
- Good.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.390
<i>The word on the street is
you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.</i>

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.029
That means you're not
a small-time punk anymore...

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.917
you're public property now.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.719
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.472
Okay. How much?

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.279
How much?

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.315
There's an answer to that, too.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.959
<i>Here's how much.</i>

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.388
Can you see it?

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.157
- Big number.
- Yeah!

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.118
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.198
You know how this works?

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.393
No. You tell me.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.269
We tell you
who's moving against you...

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.313
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.357
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.511
And then we step in for you.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.150
Got eight killers with badges
working for me.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.198
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.271
You feed me a bust now and then.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.757
<i>Some cowboy setting himself up
in business.</i>

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.550
Small fry, you know?

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.758
We like snacks.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.231
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.436
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.038
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.159
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.877
You think I want this conversation
going any farther than this table?

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.437
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.631
I don't want
to see them embarrassed.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.517
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.194
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.955
<i>You understand
what I'm talking about?</i>

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.792
Thanks for the drink.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.959
By the way...

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.871
I got a vacation coming up.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.469
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.959
We've never been there.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.191
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets, first class.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.917
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.829
Every day above ground
is a good day.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.956
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.351
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.152
Okay, Mel.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.231
You think about what I said?

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.994
About the kids?

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.672
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.755
Why don't you find your own girl?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.115
My own girl?
Yeah.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.112
That's what I'm doing.
Do it somewhere else.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.350
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.675
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.909
Will you do something?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.639
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.717
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.355
Orders? You giving me orders?

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.950
The only thing in this world...

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.510
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.149
<i>Balls.</i>

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.309
Let's go.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.869
Elvira.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.912
When you gonna learn?

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.109
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.791
That cocksucker.
What happened?

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.355
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.955
How do you know?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.315
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.512
<i>He's fertilizer.</i>

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.434
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.072
I'll tell you what, man.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.993
<i>You know our little trip
we've been planning to New York?</i>

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.752
<i>It might be a good time.</i>

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.037
Wait. Where you going?

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.432
Welcome to my private room.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.114
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.715
<i>I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.</i>

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.915
<i>Gina, you taste so muy bueno.</i>

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.951
What are you doing?
Shut up!

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.555
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.199
Get out!

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.199
Damn you!

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.952
You think he's cute?

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.395
I saw him putting his hand
all over your ass.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.277
My kid sister in a toilet.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.554
It's none of your business.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.949
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.270
Don't tell me what to do!
I'll tell you!

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.271
Listen to me. Come here.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.308
I catch you here again, I'm gonna
wipe you all over the fucking place.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.473
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.755
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.230
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.916
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.914
You think you can
tell me what to do?

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.878
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.713
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.758
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.880
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.348
What the fuck you want?
You want something?

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.430
No. Don't touch me.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.112
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.909
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.835
<i>Another great night here
at the Babylon?</i>

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.797
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.554
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.193
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.236
<i>A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.</i>

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.312
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.</i>

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.198
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.070
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.636
<i>That's the height of culture,
I assure you.</i>

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:37.030
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all time
has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.276
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.112
<i>He had the same problem
for 10 years.</i>

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.760
<i>"Lucy, don't come down to the club."</i>

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.352
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.431
All right? He cares about you.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.988
To him,
you're still his little sister.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.396
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.959
I'm 20 years old now.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.793
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.751
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.310
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life.

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.154
The only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.838
Of course he doesn't want you
mixing with those people...

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.239
growing up to be like him.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.677
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.432
Protect me against what?

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.190
Against guys like that asshole
you were dancing with tonight.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.193
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.518
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.552
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.631
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.599
<i>You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.</i>

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.193
<i>Here's a guy I found in the jungle.</i>

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.033
<i>From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.</i>

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.590
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.270
Look around. Go out with someone
who has something on the ball...

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.954
- who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.871
For instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.713
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:05.077
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.991
Are you crazy?

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.991
I see the way you look at me,
Manolo.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.999
Do you think I'm blind? I see.
Come on.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.317
What?
Look, Gina...

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.274
Tony and I are like brothers,
all right?

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.198
You're his kid sister.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.872
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.632
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.876
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.031
<i>That's not the point here!</i>

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.757
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.798
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.677
Really? Then where are you?

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.039
Shit, you're weird.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.350
- I'm weird?
- Hello?

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.749
<i>Hello, Miriam?
Tony!</i>

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.957
<i>Put Manny on, okay?
Okay. Just a second.</i>

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.508
It's Tony.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.550
<i>What are you doing,
checking up on me?</i>

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.392
Get your clothes on and meet me...

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.596
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.152
<i>What? What happened?
Nothing we can't face.</i>

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.035
All right. I'll be there.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.634
<i>You're still on the phone. Let's go.</i>

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.789
Take it easy, okay?

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.633
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.758
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:32.070
This is what
I want you to do for me:

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.158
<i>You call Lopez.</i>

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.189
<i>Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.</i>

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.838
<i>And you tell him:</i>

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.990
<i>"We fucked up, he got away."</i>

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:49.074
Okay. Yeah.
Got it? What're you going to say?

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.991
"We fucked up. He got away."

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.357
What time?
3:00 sharp.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.199
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:02.113
<i>Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.</i>

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.831
<i>I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.</i>

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.038
<i>So you owe me.</i>

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.634
<i>Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight.</i>

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:16.191
<i>I couldn't make it. I got things.
I'll tell you about them.</i>

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.271
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.794
Mel, guess what?

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.632
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers...

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.392
they won the division tonight.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.710
That's great. Congratulations.

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.833
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.068
Jesus Christ.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.751
<i>Tony, what happened to you?</i>

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.313
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.351
Who the fuck did this?

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.520
Hitters. I don't know.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.670
Somebody must've brought them in.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.992
I've never seen them before.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.719
Hello, Mel.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.758
Got an answer to this, too?

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.036
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.793
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.315
Maybe you're right, you know?

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:19.597
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.598
We'll return the favor for you,
in spades.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.319
I'll take care of this myself.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.751
What is the gun for, Tony?

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.279
What, this? It's nothing.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.953
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.518
You gonna answer, Frank?

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.155
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.997
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.755
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.549
Hello.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:31.390
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:37.352
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.950
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about...

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.429
you fucking cockroach.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.358
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.596
<i>You know what a chazer is, Frank?</i>

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.478
<i>That's a pig
that don't fly straight.</i>

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.078
Neither do you, Frank.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.279
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.278
I brought you in.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.794
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.913
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.036
I stayed loyal to you.

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.596
I made what I could on the side,
but I never turned on you, Frank!

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.229
Never!

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:21.989
But you...

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.757
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.794
Mel. Do something, will you?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.560
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.112
All right, Tony. I was the one.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.909
Please, give me a second chance.

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.393
Will you do that? Please?

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.510
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.276
<i>Okay? $10 million.</i>

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.952
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.431
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.277
Okay? All of it. $10 million.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.235
<i>Okay, Tony?</i>

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.474
Please, Tony?

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.272
Elvira? You want Elvira?

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.952
<i>You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.</i>

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.476
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.437
I never did nothing to nobody.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.398
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.517
You had somebody else do it for you.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.874
Tony, I'm begging you.

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.589
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.915
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.119
I won't kill you.

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.671
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.275
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.039
No! No!

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.158
Every dog has his day, Mel?

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:45.434
I told him...

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.677
it didn't make any sense...

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.435
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.875
<i>He got hot tonight about the broad.</i>

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.319
He fucked up.

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.635
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.392
Don't go too far, Tony.

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.593
I'm not, Mel. You are.

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.878
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.839
Whoever says you was one?

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.399
Wait a minute!

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.470
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.913
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.511
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.509
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.873
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.472
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.752
You want a job, Ernie?

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.237
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.672
Man, you got a job!

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.915
Tony! Thanks.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.832
God, what's happened?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.353
Where's Frank?

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.718
Where do you think?

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.150
<i>Come on. Get your stuff.</i>

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.119
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.150
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.151
<i>You propose it, I talk to you.</i>

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.751
<i>But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.</i>

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.718
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:56.151
We're doing $10 million,
$15 million a month. Come on.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.276
That's serious money.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.278
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.349
No way.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.069
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.511
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:11.956
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.350
the harder it is for me to rinse.

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.637
That's a problem. I didn't know.

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.518
The fact is, I can't take any more
of your money...

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.830
unless I raise the rates on you.

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.152
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.355
The IRS is coming...

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:29.000
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:30.069
I'm talking.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.549
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.074
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.515
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.909
<i>There was a Time Magazine story
that didn't help.</i>

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.399
There's a recession.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:43.710
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.109
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:49.431
I got to go 10% on the first
$12 million in denominations of 20.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.431
<i>I'll go 8% on your $10 bills...</i>

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.509
<i>6% on your fives.</i>

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.318
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:57.790
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:00.599
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.957
Once, maybe. Then what?

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:06.315
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank...

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.391
with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.232
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.828
<i>Who else can you trust?</i>

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.593
<i>That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.</i>

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.872
Did you hear that guy?

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:23.800
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.029
Stay with us.

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:28.078
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.675
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:37.077
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.557
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.189
I'll see you. Take care.
You, too.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.439
That prick!

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.558
Fucking WASP whore.

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.916
<i>Talking to me like I'm some maricón
who came over on a boat.</i>

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.437
I tell you what. We don't need
that smiling motherfucker.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:14.876
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.988
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.159
And he's connected.

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.154
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.079
I don't trust them.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.319
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.230
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.794
- Look at that.
- What?

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.198
That cable truck there.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.078
<i>Since when does it take three days
to rig a cable?</i>

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.748
What? You been watching it
for three days?

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.790
The thing has been there
for three days.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:13.598
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.913
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.271
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.953
- Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?
- You check it out.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.396
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.832
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.194
Okay? Remember that.

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:38.158
That truck could be anybody
and anything.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.559
<i>It could be a cable company...</i>

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.870
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.520
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:47.832
Here are the keys to the front door.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.717
Go down there. Give them the keys!

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:51.438
I'm just trying to say something.

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:54.432
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:55.589
I don't give a fuck.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:58.194
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.

01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.429
12% isn't peanuts.

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.635
I don't give a fuck!

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.075
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.435
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.159
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.076
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.998
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.595
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.511
<i>New construction. New jobs.</i>

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.439
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:24.034
<i>We've put your money to work
for 75 years...</i>

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.076
<i>building a more prosperous Miami.</i>

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.436
<i>Count on us being here tomorrow.</i>

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:31.557
That's because for 75 years
you been fucking everybody.

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.355
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.148
I mean, charging me 10 points
on my money.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.869
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.359
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.353
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.718
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.876
True capitalist if ever I met one.

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.352
Did you hear that?

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.511
How would you know, bubblehead?

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:02.668
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed...

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.954
and powder your nose?

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.554
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.676
Nothing exceeds like excess.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.510
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.153
What should I know?

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.794
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time?

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.678
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.439
Listen.
What time is it?

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:23.748
This Seidelbaum.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.114
6:55.

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.555
Okay.
I met with this Seidelbaum...

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.950
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:33.595
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.468
<i>With a small law-enforcement
budget, how can you put a dent...</i>

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.191
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.677
<i>It seems at times all you can do...</i>

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.716
<i>is put your finger in the dike
and pray.</i>

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.552
Put your fingers in a dyke?

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.030
<i>The only place
you can get your fingers...</i>

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.439
is in some dyke.

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.836
<i>Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.</i>

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.075
<i>These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.</i>

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.790
<i>I am not one of those voices.</i>

01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.518
I know that. But you know why?

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.319
<i>'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.</i>

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.630
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.678
<i>... splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.552
It's those guys, man!

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.710
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians...

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.950
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.316
<i>So they can make the fucking money,
and then get the fucking votes!</i>

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:28.472
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.557
They fuck anything and anyone.

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.598
Can't you stop saying "fuck"
all the time?

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.320
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.279
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.913
You're boring.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.477
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.598
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:51.240
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.795
That's 'cause he was so smart.

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.352
You know what you're becoming?

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.716
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.031
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:14.553
<i>Get out of the way of the TV!</i>

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.279
Dig a hole in the yard,
bury it, and forget about it.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.637
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.154
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.156
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.753
What is my problem?

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.869
You got nothing to do
with your life.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.599
Why don't you get a job
or something?

01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:42.911
Do something. Be a nurse.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.473
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.435
Anything beats lying around all day
waiting for me to fuck you!

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.429
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.556
No? Frank was better?

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.233
You're an asshole!

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.957
Where you going? Come here!

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.750
Elvie!

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.714
I was kidding!

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.232
I was only kidding!

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:13.759
I guess sometimes married life
is not all it's cracked up to be.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.434
- Where you going?
- I got a date.

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:18.838
You got a date? Come here.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.433
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.033
Yeah, it's all set up.

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.311
Yeah, well, you forget it.

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.311
<i>Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.</i>

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:36.039
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.595
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.989
<i>You like the ladies
more than the money.</i>

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.069
That's your problem.

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.958
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.349
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing...

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.919
who're you gonna trust?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.194
Junior partner.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.635
Bullshit, man.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.995
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:58.035
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.758
You are an asshole, man!

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.910
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.479
Fuck you, man!

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.876
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.116
Who do I trust? Me!

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.597
Fuck him. "Trust."

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.352
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:23.553
I need that shit.

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.599
I don't need him.

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:31.235
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.748
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:37.513
<i>I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?</i>

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:41.190
You saw me with Marlon Brando?
You know, we're good friends.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.589
- I was his driver.
- No shit?

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:47.229
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.797
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:50.949
Italian guy.

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:54.589
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.036
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.031
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.515
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.474
- Subtotal.
- No?

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.433
He's a nice guy.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.834
$283,107.65.

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.431
You want a company cheque here?

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.628
I got $284,600.

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:26.036
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.550
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:34.871
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:38.912
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.795
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.553
This cheque here,
where does this check go?

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:51.229
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.232
Montana Realty Company.

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:56.909
Montana Realty Company.

01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:00.630
That's $284,000.
$284,600.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.994
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:08.358
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.359
<i>You ask him.</i>

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.153
We're up to what?

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:36.476
Seven cheques. $1,325,623.

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:41.151
$200,000 more.

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:43.356
- We ought to take a leak.
- Freeze!

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.714
Get your hands up!

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.313
Go against the wall, turn around.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.389
You're not kidding.

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.552
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:52.232
"You have the right
to remain silent.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.788
"Anything you say
can and will be taken against you."

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:58.190
How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.478
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.797
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.950
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.357
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he'll do.

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.670
You see that eye there in the clock?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.877
<i>Say, "Hi, honey."</i>

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.829
<i>That's pretty cute. Look at that.</i>

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:21.036
<i>You jerk off in front of us,
Seidelbaum?</i>

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:23.350
<i>I was supposed to meet this
chick at 3:00.</i>

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.192
<i>You're a fucking pain in the ass.</i>

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.238
<i>All right, Benny, kill it.</i>

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.628
You understand the rights
I've given you?

01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.870
I know all that bullshit,
Seidelbaum!

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.279
Save your breath.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:37.199
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:39.910
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:43.511
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.909
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:52.115
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:55.034
So dress warm.

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:02.874
Give me a cheque
for $100,000, plus $300,000 in cash.

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.074
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.798
They're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion...

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.558
and they'll get it.

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.550
So, what am I looking at here?

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.876
Five years. You'll be out in three.

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.520
<i>Maybe less, if I can make a deal.</i>

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:28.559
Three fucking years!

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.068
For what?

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:36.436
Washing money? The fucking country
was built on washed money.

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:37.839
Can't be that bad.

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:40.275
- It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:43.432
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.239
You fucking high?
I'll delay the trial.

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:49.438
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.635
Fuck you, man!

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.631
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.472
<i>No way. I been there.</i>

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.199
Okay, look.

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:07.473
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.957
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:16.790
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.713
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you got $1,300,000...

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.912
undeclared
staring into a videotape camera...

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:29.394
honey baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:54.474
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:55.629
I really appreciate it.

01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:57.358
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:00.598
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.

01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:03.069
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.754
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:08.718
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:11.155
<i>I want you to meet
some of my friends.</i>

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:17.108
This is Pedro Quinn...

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.111
chairman of
the Andes Sugar Corporation.

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.589
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:24.911
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.509
Pleasure.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.556
This is Ariel Bleyer...

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:32.513
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:38.354
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:41.154
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?

01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.593
Sit here, Tony.

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.428
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:54.031
I would like to discuss something...

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.031
that is of interest
to all of us here.

01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.952
You have a problem, Tony.

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:02.832
We have a problem.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:06.599
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:11.194
<i>We all know you have tax troubles
in your country...</i>

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.874
<i>and that you may have to do
a little time.</i>

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.993
<i>We have friends in Washington...</i>

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.038
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:22.510
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine...

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.271
but there will be no prison.

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:26.909
Okay.

01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.677
So what's your problem, Alex?

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:32.398
I'll show you my problem.

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.592
<i>I've heard about financial...</i>

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:35.954
<i>support the government receives...</i>

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:37.792
<i>from the drug industry in Bolivia.</i>

01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:41.031
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money...</i>

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:42.599
<i>which is in the billions...</i>

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.472
<i>is coming from your country.</i>

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:48.235
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product...</i>

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.038
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.270
<i>You're saying
the U.S. Government...</i>

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:56.478
<i>is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets.</i>

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.318
<i>At the same time...</i>

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.153
<i>we are doing business
with the same government...</i>

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.794
<i>that is flooding our streets
with cocaine.</i>

02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:06.588
<i>Let me show you
a few of the other characters...</i>

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.830
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:13.994
<i>My organization just recently traced
a large purchase by this man.</i>

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:18.076
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:21.477
<i>He is the Minister of the Defense
of Bolivia, my country.</i>

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:24.269
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago...</i>

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:28.558
<i>bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.837
<i>Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian Defense Minister...</i>

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:34.070
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.593
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:40.792
<i>This man here, Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.</i>

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.632
<i>He's a wealthy landowner...</i>

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:45.188
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:49.314
<i>But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...</i>

02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:52.199
<i>of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.</i>

02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:54.714
<i>He's not your ordinary drug dealer.</i>

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:57.794
<i>Well, discussing it openly...</i>

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:01.235
<i>He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.</i>

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:07.113
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:10.478
People everywhere
are starting to listen to him.

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.558
It's embarrassing, Tony.

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.875
That is our problem.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.550
You remember Alberto, don't you?

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.478
How could I forget him?

02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:28.391
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.635
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:35.237
But he doesn't speak English.

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.838
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.957
He needs a little help.

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.911
Is that a problem, Tony?

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.158
No problem.

02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:55.669
Good.

02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.114
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.358
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.717
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:22.715
Politics.

02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:30.431
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.238
Run things for me.

02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:36.030
I gotta go to New York next week.

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:43.348
Fuck this, man.

02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.238
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.912
You don't like it?

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.991
You got me into this mess
in the first place.

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.629
With that fucking Seidelbaum,
that right?

02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:59.039
With Seidelbaum?

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:01.236
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.959
How do you connect those two?

02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.874
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:08.916
I'm not hungry.

02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:12.438
You're not hungry?
Do you know about the trial?

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:16.559
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.149
Do you even know that Sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.233
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.596
Eating, drinking...

02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.150
fucking, sucking...

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:47.879
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.075
Then what?

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:52.432
Tell me. Then what?

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.672
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:01.679
You got tits, you need a bra.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.993
They got hair on them.

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.391
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it...

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.436
and you're eating
this fucking shit...

02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:14.310
and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:17.114
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.149
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.198
This what I work for? Tell me.

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:29.714
Look at that.

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:32.034
A junkie.

02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:37.958
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:42.675
Sleeps all day
with them black shades on.

02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:46.874
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.

02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:50.509
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.475
I can't even have a kid with her.

02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:57.154
Her womb is so polluted...

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.118
I can't even have
a fucking little baby with her!

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:02.430
You son of a bitch!

02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:04.912
You fuck!

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:08.829
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:12.355
What makes you
so much better than me?

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.034
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.556
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:20.475
Real contribution to human history.

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:23.279
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.634
Tell the world.

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.473
What kind of a father
would you make?

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.155
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:34.676
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.998
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.469
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs...

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:43.152
hanging around all the time?

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:47.109
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:51.438
What kind of life is that?

02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:57.119
Can't you see...

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.954
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:05.030
<i>We're not winners, we're losers.</i>

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.913
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.469
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:16.557
I'm not going home with you.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.991
I'm not going home with anybody.

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:23.239
I'm going home alone.

02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.954
I'm leaving you.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.271
I don't need this shit anymore.

02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:37.718
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.916
Let her go.

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:43.239
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.033
What're you looking at?

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:00.995
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:03.713
You know why?

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:08.637
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.270
You need people like me.

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:21.199
You need people like me...

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:23.874
so you can point
your fucking fingers...

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.630
and say, "That's the bad guy."

02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:30.595
So...

02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:33.078
what does that make you?

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:34.669
Good?

02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.112
You're not good.

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:43.071
You just know how to hide...

02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:45.948
how to lie.

02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:51.796
Me, I don't have that problem.

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.512
Me, I always tell the truth.

02:07:58.160 --> 02:07:59.798
Even when I lie.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:11.034
So say good night to the bad guy!

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:12.834
Come on.

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:17.713
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again...

02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.119
let me tell you.

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:23.511
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:27.309
<i>There's a bad guy coming through!</i>

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:29.632
<i>Better get out of his way!</i>

02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:36.753
NEW YORK CITY

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:57.109
No. You tell Sheffield to keep
his nose out of it.

02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:00.517
<i>There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.</i>

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:02.911
<i>Just tell him to stay out of it!</i>

02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:05.749
<i>Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?</i>

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.353
Yeah, all right.

02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:26.832
Tony, everything go okay?

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:28.878
Yeah, everything is roses.

02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:34.158
Ernie, what time do you got?

02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.988
- Ten to.
- Ten to.

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.191
- Where is this guy?
- I gotta call Manny.

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:41.349
Sit down.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:42.953
You don't tell me what to do here!

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.190
He's coming out.
He's coming.

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:48.755
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:53.954
We do it
in front of the United Nations.

02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:55.871
That's how they want it.

02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:58.076
I don't care where you blow him up.

02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.113
<i>Tell me when, okay?</i>

02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:04.559
<i>You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.</i>

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.875
I want you to stay thirty meters
behind the car, okay?

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:14.278
Thirty meters. No more.

02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:16.396
I heard you the first time.

02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:18.277
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.431
I told you thirty meters.

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:24.550
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.752
Look. Here he comes.

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:33.551
Where's he going?

02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:35.398
<i>What's he doing that way?</i>

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.912
What the fuck he doing?

02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:03.151
What the fuck is that? Come here.

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:05.231
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.029
She did, every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:14.516
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.154
Forget it!

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.639
We kill this guy alone.
No wife, no kids.

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:26.598
No way. If Sosa says we do it now,
we do it now. Let's go.

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:29.037
This fucking guy.

02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:00.479
Okay, just stay behind him.

02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:04.558
Slowly, slowly.

02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.273
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:08.953
Okay. Easy.

02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.519
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.833
<i>This is so fucking bad.</i>

02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.873
You're losing them. Look!
You're losing them!

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.757
I see them, all right? I see them!

02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:26.155
Ten meters, ten meters!

02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:28.357
Move it. Move it!

02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.078
Shut the fuck up, okay?

02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.635
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:47.199
You gotta hide with that shit...

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:48.269
Shut your mouth.

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:49.998
He's getting up. Let's do it.

02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:51.638
Make you feel good?

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:54.998
Make you feel good to kill a mama
and her kids. Make you feel big.

02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.149
Shut your mouth!

02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:58.639
Like you, big man! Fuck you!

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.633
<i>What do you think I am?</i>

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:02.790
You think I kill two kids
and a woman?

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:06.236
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:10.357
You die, motherfucker!

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:16.513
What do you think I am?

02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:18.670
You think I'm a fucking worm
like you?

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.350
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.755
I told you, no fucking kids!

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.839
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:36.315
Nick, where the fuck you been?

02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:38.913
<i>On a delivery?</i>

02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:41.597
Where the hell is Manny?

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.477
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:45.869
I don't know, Tony.

02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:47.712
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:50.155
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He's gone? Where?</i>

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.994
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:56.350
You can't trust nobody anymore!

02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:59.716
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:01.950
<i>He didn't say nothing.
He took off?</i>

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:05.951
<i>Are you all right?
No, I'm not! I'm pissed!</i>

02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:07.155
When I get back there...

02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:09.196
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:11.999
<i>When you coming back?
I'm coming back tonight!</i>

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.311
This fucking cocksucker.

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:19.311
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:23.912
<i>Gone? Where?
She got to see you right away.</i>

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.549
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:30.797
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?

02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.115
<i>No.
No.</i>

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:34.872
Okay, listen to me.

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.190
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:39.350
Okay? Just tell her that.

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:03.952
You hear from Manny?
No.

02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:05.837
Your mama called, she gotta see you.

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:09.879
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.633
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
No.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:18.393
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.596
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.

02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:23.717
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

02:16:37.799 --> 02:16:42.031
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.

02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:45.480
They told me.

02:16:45.559 --> 02:16:47.437
Okay. I'm coming over.

02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:50.239
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.076
Put it on the speaker.

02:17:05.719 --> 02:17:07.755
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:11.477
<i>Alex, how you doing?
What happened?</i>

02:17:11.799 --> 02:17:14.030
We had some problems.

02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.509
<i>Alex?
Tony, what happened?</i>

02:17:21.879 --> 02:17:24.030
<i>We had a little problem.
I heard.</i>

02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.235
How you hear that?

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.389
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.313
He was not supposed to give
that speech.

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:35.717
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

02:17:35.799 --> 02:17:37.950
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen...

02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:39.473
so I cancelled his contract.

02:17:39.559 --> 02:17:41.915
My partners and I are pissed off.

02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:44.157
That's okay. No big deal.

02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.272
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:49.351
No, Tony, you can't do that.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.878
They found what was under the car.

02:17:53.719 --> 02:17:56.280
Now our friend has got security
up the ass.

02:17:56.559 --> 02:17:59.950
<i>The heat will come down hard
on my partners and me.</i>

02:18:00.719 --> 02:18:02.597
There's not gonna be a next time...

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:06.228
<i>- you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.</i>

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:10.990
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:12.957
Who the fuck
you think you're talking to?

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:14.189
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:17.556
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.870
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

02:18:22.959 --> 02:18:25.269
Alex, you there? Hey!

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:28.755
<i>He's not there. Cálmate, man.</i>

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:33.789
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:36.270
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:38.954
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

02:18:39.959 --> 02:18:41.678
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:44.638
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?

02:18:44.719 --> 02:18:46.995
- I don't give her that much money.
- You did!

02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:50.072
- One time, $1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?

02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:52.637
I don't know.

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:55.036
There was this car in the driveway.

02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:56.791
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

02:18:56.879 --> 02:18:59.519
- She's like you.
- Where's the place? Where is it?

02:18:59.719 --> 02:19:02.598
400 something...

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:03.795
Citrus Drive.

02:19:03.879 --> 02:19:06.155
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.472
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

02:19:09.559 --> 02:19:11.312
<i>She says to me, "Mira, shut up!</i>

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:12.593
"Mind your own business."

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.477
Exactly like you do to me.

02:19:14.559 --> 02:19:17.233
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.920
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.956
Why do you have to destroy...

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:24.235
everything that comes your way?

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.509
409 Citrus Drive.

02:19:30.799 --> 02:19:33.791
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.873
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:11.677
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.711
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.673
Jesus, Tony.

02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:21.430
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.

02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:23.552
Go get Gina.

02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:32.509
No!

02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:41.718
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:43.358
God!

02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.032
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:54.951
We gotta get out of here.

02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:34.513
Come on, Gina.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:40.110
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:42.231
- You got her?
- I got her.

02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:12.149
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:58.118
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

02:24:58.200 --> 02:24:59.838
She's cooling down. Right?

02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:02.753
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:07.032
What are we gonna do now?

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:12.469
Do?

02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.712
We're going to war.

02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:21.950
<i>That's what we're gonna do.</i>

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.318
We're gonna eat that Sosa
for breakfast!

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.074
Close that fucker down.

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:40.676
Tony, take it easy.

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:51.277
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.

02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:01.197
Come on.

02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:03.669
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:22.558
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.

02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:33.680
We gotta get organized here.

02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:47.517
Fuck! Manny.

02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:55.951
How the fuck I do that?

02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:02.229
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:46.909
Manolo.

02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:40.516
Is this what you want, Tony?

02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.038
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:58.157
So you want me, Tony?

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.193
What are you talking about?

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:06.159
Is that it?

02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:11.199
Here I am, Tony.

02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:18.076
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:22.318
I'm all yours now.

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:27.070
You better come and get me now.

02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:29.791
Come on.
Come and get me.

02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:31.279
Come and get me.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:34.913
You do it now before it's too late.

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:38.629
Come on, Tony.

02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:41.835
Fuck me.

02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:48.029
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:05.229
Die!

02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:21.394
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:47.833
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:06.193
Please talk to me.

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:09.439
Don't be mad at me.

02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:12.877
Please. Gina, come on.

02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:18.115
I love Manny, you know?

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:19.634
I love him.

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:23.989
And I love you, too, you know?

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:50.868
Give me a smile.

02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:55.078
They're coming from everywhere!
Open up! Open the fucking door!

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:58.551
<i>Please! Tony!</i>

02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:00.551
<i>Let me in, boss! Please!</i>

02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:02.716
<i>Tony, open the fucking door!</i>

02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:28.635
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.230
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:40.269
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:46.631
<i>You're fucking with the best!</i>

02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.478
You want to fuck with me?

02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:55.918
You cockroaches.

02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:01.759
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:07.918
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:11.430
Say hello to my little friend!

02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:16.153
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:19.999
<i>There! You like that?</i>

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:23.028
You want more?

02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:30.989
<i>You whores!</i>

02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:33.429
Cowards!

02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:20.553
Want to fuck with me?

02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:38.392
<i>Go ahead!</i>

02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:40.789
<i>Come on!</i>

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.470
How do you like that?

02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:48.117
<i>You fucking maricón!</i>

02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:52.078
You think you can take me?

02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:54.310
<i>You need a fucking army
if you gonna take me!</i>

02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.552
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:07.232
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.588
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.153
I'm still standing.

02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:22.669
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:26.031
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:27.792
You think you kill me with bullets?

02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:30.440
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!

02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:34.194
