WEBVTT

00:15.798 --> 00:17.930
I talked to Jenny McAullife
today.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.236
Lord, why?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.281
She cornered me.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.110
What did you guys talk about?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.633
I don't even remember.

00:24.676 --> 00:27.331
She was going on and on about
something really boring,

00:27.375 --> 00:31.988
like a family car trip, and
she was just so excited.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.598
It was so weird.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.513
It's not like she was
talking about a new boyfriend

00:35.557 --> 00:38.429
or seeing her favorite band.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.388
She was just psyched.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.347
Like high on life.

00:44.479 --> 00:49.049
Yeah, war, child abuse, poverty,disease,

00:49.092 --> 00:51.355
life gets me wasted.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.965
And I was thinking,

00:53.009 --> 00:55.577
I've never been that excitedabout anything and I'm like 17.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.928
It's only gonna get lamer
and more boring from here.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.886
People who are that happy are
insane.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.239
We're doomed.

02:15.918 --> 02:19.139
Well peeps, it's Friday
and you are all set

02:19.182 --> 02:20.444
for another weekend.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.275
Yeah, that's slammin'.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.321
And while most of you
will do the right thing

02:27.364 --> 02:30.715
like doing homework and going tochurch,

02:30.759 --> 02:32.587
some of you will be putting yourfutures

02:32.630 --> 02:34.284
and your very lives at stake.

02:35.503 --> 02:39.768
Yes, homeboys and girls,
I'm talking about partying.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.470
Check your head, and
don't believe the hype.

02:46.514 --> 02:50.518
It's no difference if it's
brewskies or the kind herb,

02:50.561 --> 02:54.826
coke, crank, smack, LSD, PCP,

02:54.870 --> 02:58.961
model airplane glue,
vaginal, oral, or anal.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.792
It all leads to the same place.

03:03.835 --> 03:08.753
Jail, the hospital or the
graveyard.

03:08.797 --> 03:09.798
For reals.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.368
Holla if ya hear me.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.849
Has Mrs. Feen ever even had sex?

03:21.549 --> 03:24.726
So let's all give it up and turnit loose

03:24.769 --> 03:28.251
and watch these three
short educational films,

03:28.295 --> 03:29.644
You Booze, You Lose,

03:29.687 --> 03:31.646
The BloodStained Cell Phone,

03:31.689 --> 03:34.126
and Conchita Has Genital Warts.

03:41.525 --> 03:42.700
Hall lockers,

03:42.744 --> 03:44.746
true windows to the soul.
Ugly dykes.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.272
These are the innocent,
carefree good times

03:49.316 --> 03:51.143
we'll remember the rest of our
lives.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.025
Pain is weakness leaving the
body?

04:04.244 --> 04:07.247
So what, if you get run overby a car it makes you stronger?

04:07.290 --> 04:08.596
Or what about getting bone
cancer?

04:08.639 --> 04:09.597
I hear that's painful.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.946
You'd be hella strong then.

04:10.989 --> 04:11.816
He's cute.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.385
You're worse than my mother.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.733
He'd do it with you and then
laugh

04:16.778 --> 04:18.910
and send all his friends
pictures.

04:18.954 --> 04:19.694
Can't I even look?

04:19.737 --> 04:20.869
They can't be all bad.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.569
Y'know, we should be lesbians.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.049
I can't do the wardrobe.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.486
Also that partner word.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.619
Yuck, Partner sounds like you
work

04:31.662 --> 04:33.969
at a law firm or co-own a muffinshop.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.624
Muffin shop.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.627
Yo, what did one lesbian vampire

04:39.670 --> 04:41.193
say to the other lesbian
vampire?

04:41.237 --> 04:42.586
We don't care.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.240
See you next month .

04:46.286 --> 04:47.548
Well, that's my cue.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.027
Talk to you later.
See ya.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.294
Yo.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.644
You know what your problem is?

04:57.732 --> 04:59.690
Did I consent to this
conversation?

04:59.734 --> 05:01.170
You think you smarter than
everybody.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.519
'Cause you all serious all the
time

05:02.563 --> 05:03.694
and 'cause I always clowning andwhatevs,

05:03.738 --> 05:06.218
you think I'm not thoughtful andshit.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.176
Well, yes.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.960
But my shit is deep, though.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.615
And how deep would that shit be?

05:11.659 --> 05:13.182
Yo, check this.

05:13.225 --> 05:16.620
So I used to wonder so fewblack people are serial killers.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.274
But then I figured it out.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.971
The whole thing about
being a serial killer

05:20.015 --> 05:22.409
is that cops leave 'em alone
so you do it again and again.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.715
Jeffrey Dahmer's got some
rotten dead guy in his freezer

05:24.759 --> 05:26.891
cops come over, well Mr. Dahmer,

05:26.935 --> 05:28.371
we've had some complaints abouta smell,

05:28.415 --> 05:30.330
but looks like everything's finehere.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.722
Why don't you get back to skullfucking

05:31.766 --> 05:34.246
that corpse you just
warmed up in the microwave.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.552
Brother can't do that.

05:35.596 --> 05:36.684
Black man walkin' down the
street,

05:36.727 --> 05:37.859
the cops go hey hey what's yourname?

05:37.902 --> 05:39.121
Show me some ID, get in the car,

05:39.164 --> 05:40.470
we're gonna beat your ass

05:40.514 --> 05:42.124
until you confess to
something you ain't done.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.604
There ain't no time to pick up
20 girls

05:43.647 --> 05:45.432
on the street and make
hooker soup out of 'em.

05:45.475 --> 05:48.478
Police be on a brother's
ass every other week.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.656
Stevie, do you actually
know any black people?

05:55.006 --> 05:55.833
No.

05:55.877 --> 05:56.878
But you know why?

05:56.921 --> 05:59.663
'Cause it's a racist conspiracy.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.883
Oh hang on, you got
something on your face.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.411
Okay, that was cute,
but I'm going this way,

06:08.455 --> 06:09.934
and you're going that way.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.241
No worries, no bigness.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.461
Tell your Mama she was on her
game the day she made you.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.419
You a fine little meow meow.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.289
Meow meow.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.294
French philosopher Octave
Mirbeau

06:22.338 --> 06:25.472
once wrote the universe
appears to me like an immense,

06:25.515 --> 06:27.299
inexorable torture garden.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.432
Do you agree or disagree and
why?

06:31.303 --> 06:34.481
I feel this is a trick question.

06:35.482 --> 06:39.399
Life is torture for everyonewho's not stupid or super rich.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.403
But that answer will make
you think that I am someone

06:43.446 --> 06:45.883
who will spend their whole timeat school

06:47.058 --> 06:48.451
starting campus protests.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.583
So,

06:51.367 --> 06:53.500
no, I disagree.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.939
The universe is a beautiful
place full of laughing babies

06:57.982 --> 07:00.115
and puppies that fart rainbows.

07:01.595 --> 07:02.770
Describe the world

07:02.813 --> 07:06.077
within 100 feet of you right
now.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.383
Okay.

07:07.427 --> 07:11.996
Well, there's my dad,
who is probably peeing.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.564
My dad seems to be
peeing a lot these days.

07:15.870 --> 07:19.047
Perhaps he is pregnant.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.137
My teddy bear Lionel.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.661
The vibrator I ordered online

07:24.705 --> 07:26.489
using my elderly neighbor's name

07:26.533 --> 07:28.796
so if my dad opened the
box I could just say

07:28.839 --> 07:30.537
the mailman made a mistake.

07:30.580 --> 07:35.585
My custom magic 8 ball that
only gives me answers I like.

07:39.589 --> 07:44.072
And a sweaty fat chick

07:44.115 --> 07:48.076
sitting at a computer who reallyhopes she gets into college

07:48.119 --> 07:50.121
so she can escape this buttholeof a town

07:50.165 --> 07:51.601
before it eats her alive.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.387
Please attach a photo of
yourself.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.301
Aren't I old enough for grown-upfood?

08:39.344 --> 08:41.303
I don't have time to make two
meals.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.307
You,

08:46.613 --> 08:48.615
you need chew food.

08:48.658 --> 08:49.833
I am.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.488
No, you need chew more.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.882
40 times every bite.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.710
Digest properly.

08:56.753 --> 09:01.062
Food expand in stomach, get
stuck in intestine for weeks.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.847
Even months.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.762
If that were true, wouldn't
people just explode?

09:05.806 --> 09:07.068
Don't be sassy.

09:08.809 --> 09:09.636
40 times.

09:11.202 --> 09:14.249
One, two, three,

09:15.163 --> 09:16.077
four, five.

09:16.947 --> 09:17.731
See?

09:17.774 --> 09:20.385
Six, seven, eight.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.998
Nine, 10, 11.
No chew?

09:30.918 --> 09:32.136
Do you have any mints?

09:32.180 --> 09:34.399
My mom will shit if she smells
this on me.

09:34.443 --> 09:35.270
Nolo problemo.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.367
I bow downeth before thee, nobleknave.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.110
Oh, show's starting.

09:51.112 --> 09:51.982
Isn't it cool when you see

09:52.026 --> 09:54.855
two ugly people totally in love?

09:54.898 --> 09:56.944
How do you know they're in love?

09:56.987 --> 09:58.293
They're probably both married

09:58.336 --> 10:00.774
and met on
fatsoswannahaveanaffair.com.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.124
Come on, he adores her.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.908
Cooking her dinner.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.650
Yeah, so he can hit that
droopy behind after.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.566
You mean right now.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.788
I feel bad we're watching.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.311
Not too bad, obviously.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.099
It's biological 'cause
he puts out chemicals

10:22.143 --> 10:23.535
in the air that go into her
brain

10:23.579 --> 10:26.364
and they make her feel all loveydovey.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.453
I saw a TV show about it.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.195
So that's why people fall in
love?

10:31.239 --> 10:34.459
That's what people write books
and songs and poetry about?

10:35.460 --> 10:36.548
Chemicals?

10:36.592 --> 10:37.506
The way we smell?

10:38.594 --> 10:39.639
Yeah, pretty much.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.729
Yeah, I dunno.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.003
Okay, now I feel bad for
watching.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.704
Oh my god, how does that even
work?

11:03.314 --> 11:05.142
I think we're venturing
into can't be unseen

11:05.186 --> 11:06.448
territory.
No.

11:10.060 --> 11:14.282
As you know, the recent
gangland style murders

11:14.325 --> 11:17.633
at nearby Pettitville
Elementary School have given

11:17.677 --> 11:18.460
everyone in our community.
Did you do

11:18.503 --> 11:19.940
your college essays yet?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.593
No, my mom's paying someone to
do it.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.031
A pro, some guy she found on theinternet.

11:27.382 --> 11:31.603
Luckily, the School Board,
along with Coach Greene,

11:31.647 --> 11:33.693
using his position as head

11:33.736 --> 11:37.000
of Morgansfield Volunteer
Militia,

11:37.044 --> 11:39.394
have agreed upon a plan to keep

11:39.437 --> 11:42.876
us all safe at this unstable
time.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.578
Stevie D tried to kiss me.

11:49.621 --> 11:50.927
When?
After school.

11:50.971 --> 11:54.061
That plan involves arming

11:54.104 --> 11:57.238
and training our janitorial
staff.

11:59.327 --> 12:00.676
What?
Sometimes I am glad I'm ugly

12:00.720 --> 12:03.244
so I don't have d-bags hitting
on me.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.898
You're not ugly.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.769
You'll always be more popular
than me.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.423
If we didn't have ballet class
together when we were seven,

12:08.466 --> 12:10.207
we wouldn't be friends now.
Staff can become

12:10.251 --> 12:11.992
the good guys with the guns.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.558
See, what's that?
Hey.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.520
You gonna go be all cool withoutme?

12:19.956 --> 12:22.829
Our head janitor and newly named

12:22.872 --> 12:27.050
Chief of School Security, JaimeJimenez.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.929
Does this pity party have a
dress code?

12:35.972 --> 12:37.321
Just stop.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.106
What if I don't wanna stop?
I love the students

12:39.149 --> 12:40.803
in this school.

12:40.847 --> 12:45.852
But even more, I love to
be crime stopping hero

12:46.113 --> 12:47.679
shooting the bad guys.

12:49.116 --> 12:52.815
Thanks you for this
opportunity to live my dreams.

12:53.860 --> 12:57.907
And go tigers.

13:18.058 --> 13:20.538
Next on Knocked Up Castaways,

13:20.582 --> 13:24.804
Bree is 32 weeks and finds the
last coconut on St. Marcos.

13:26.893 --> 13:30.287
Janet, what's a five
letter word for mistake?

13:30.331 --> 13:32.202
Starts with a B?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.116
I don't know.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.514
Dad, do we have any ice cream?

13:39.557 --> 13:40.732
I ate the last.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.473
Thanks.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.779
Well there's peppermint cake.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.738
From like two years ago,
I hate peppermint cake.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.305
I know.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.264
That's why it's still there, I
guess.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.268
[Female Announcer] I used to
doubt myself.

13:54.311 --> 13:57.662
Worried about whether I was
good enough, pretty enough.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.665
If the things I felt were
wrong, or even crazy.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.061
That's why I talked to
my doctor about Femtrexl.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.107
If you are a woman 14-70

14:07.150 --> 14:11.328
and feel overwhelmed by your
feelings, Femtrexl can help.

The security question

15:29.885 --> 15:32.583

Is Kat home?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.516
She not home.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.475
Can I help you with something?

15:54.518 --> 15:56.433
We were supposed to do homeworktogether.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.869
Do you know where she is?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.132
It Halloween.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.655
She probably out there
frightening

16:00.698 --> 16:02.657
little children and old people.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.527
You want wait?

16:10.317 --> 16:12.797
You know, you have pretty face.

16:15.887 --> 16:16.976
Looking at you,

16:18.455 --> 16:21.937
I am thinking we can do
something very nice together.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.808

16:23.852 --> 16:26.550

16:30.859 --> 16:34.384
No, I really don't--
Come on, it won't take long.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.733
There is room in basement.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.919
Is very good for burning fat.

16:52.750 --> 16:53.925
Okay, you try.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.058
Wait, wait.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.929
It's not bad time of month, no?

16:58.887 --> 16:59.670
No.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.020
Oh, good.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.370
Never exercise during that time,never.

17:03.413 --> 17:04.848
Also, no camping, okay?

17:04.893 --> 17:07.461
The smell, it attract bear
and wolf from miles away.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.157
You sure enough dead.

17:09.202 --> 17:12.422
It's okay, Asians don't camp
really.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.164
Interesting.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.035
Please.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.080
You do 20.
20?

17:19.125 --> 17:19.951
Yes.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.300
I've never done one.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.260
Okay.
Come on.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.653
Yeah, you can do it.

17:25.695 --> 17:26.522
Come on.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.744
Burn the baby fat, burn it.

17:29.787 --> 17:30.614
That hurts.

17:31.789 --> 17:35.532
In my country, women have
to be tough like boys.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.317
Is that to fight the bears?

17:37.360 --> 17:40.363
I am more traditional American
guy.

it's just exercise.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.071
Woo.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.594
You're a fast learner.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.815
Whoa, whoa, got an invite?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.382
Yo dog, I'm a s'more.

17:59.426 --> 18:02.168
Selling grams to crackers, you
feel me?

18:02.211 --> 18:03.560
Come on, man, no invite, no
party.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.780
Oh, come on man, help a brotherout.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.217
Get outta here.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.088
Next.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.359
Jesus, are you stalking me?

18:19.402 --> 18:20.490
Sometimes not that much
difference

18:20.534 --> 18:23.058
between extra friendly and
criminal.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.061
Nice costume.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.932
Who you supposed to be?

18:27.976 --> 18:29.847
I'm a Roy Lichtenstein painting.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.068
Lichtenstein, he's good.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.592
Can you sneak me in?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.028
No.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.987
Come on, we'll go in
together, it'll be super easy.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.989
I don't want to go back in, it'sboring.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.035
Well then at least could you letme

18:44.079 --> 18:45.515
took on that boom shaka laka.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.837
That's good, that relaxes me.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.838
I can see that.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.276
You know how like you can

19:07.320 --> 19:11.280
bring a dog on a plane
now without being blind?

19:12.499 --> 19:14.153
You just need like a
letter from your doctor

19:14.196 --> 19:16.111
that says it helps you relax.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.634
What kind of shit is that?

19:17.678 --> 19:18.548
Helps you relax.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.202
You know what helps me relax?

19:20.246 --> 19:21.812
A bong and a big booty stripper.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.814
They don't let me bring
that on a plane, though.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.468
Strippers, huh?

19:25.512 --> 19:26.774
You can't even get into
a high school party,

19:26.817 --> 19:28.689
how do you get let in a strip
club?

19:31.909 --> 19:33.520
What are you kids doing here?

19:33.563 --> 19:35.391
We live here.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.610
Brandon's our brother.

19:36.653 --> 19:39.090
He kicked us out until the
party's over.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.789
They're using my room
for corn oil wrestling.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
Where are your parents?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.009
In Costa Rica.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.141
I wanna go to bed.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.230
Why don't you guys talk

19:48.274 --> 19:49.666
to those nice men over there,
okay?

19:49.710 --> 19:50.841
They'll put you to bed.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.890
My bro sneaks me into
Sugars in Middlefield.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.631
Told 'em I was 25.

19:57.674 --> 19:58.806
They bought it, too.

19:58.849 --> 19:59.850
25?

19:59.894 --> 20:02.113
Is it a strip club for the
blind?

20:02.157 --> 20:05.116
Unicorn, freeze!

20:05.160 --> 20:06.248
High protein.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.252
Doesn't Kat's mom have a
business?

20:10.296 --> 20:11.949
She did.

20:11.993 --> 20:15.214
In Graysville, a vintage used
pillow shop.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.041
What happened to it?

20:17.085 --> 20:18.304
Bedbugs .

20:19.957 --> 20:22.003
People kept returning pillows

20:22.046 --> 20:23.961
with rash on side of face,

20:24.005 --> 20:28.444
red bites on the neck,
internet reviews not so good.

20:28.488 --> 20:29.924
Yeesh.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.405
Diane, very rich lady,

20:34.015 --> 20:36.322
not so smart at financials.

20:36.365 --> 20:40.804
When Vigara was coming out,
she invested in Spanish Fly.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.721
Nothing you need to understand.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.992
She is foolish to stay at work.

20:55.036 --> 20:59.693
Women are good at certain
things, feelings, love,
worrying.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.739
Men are good at other things.

21:02.783 --> 21:06.613
Money, killing, growing beard.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.050
Creating amazing technologies

21:09.093 --> 21:10.921
that will eventually destroy usall.

21:13.097 --> 21:13.924
Yes.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.237
I can't believe I'm doing this.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.151
Girl, why you frontin'?

21:23.194 --> 21:24.935
You wet as a mermaid.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.940
Do you have a condom?

21:29.984 --> 21:32.116
Chill baby, I got my golden
ticket.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.990
Are you sure it's on right?

21:36.033 --> 21:38.122
It's all good, all right?

21:38.166 --> 21:39.776
It's all good.

21:39.820 --> 21:40.821
Oh.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.388
Oh yeah.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.825
That's it, yeah.

21:44.868 --> 21:45.695
Oh, you nasty.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.177
Oh, oh, oh, atta boy.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.352
That's mama's home cookin' rightthere.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.311
Get the groceries, get the
groceries.

22:02.538 --> 22:03.713
Are you done?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.280
Yeah, baby.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.542
Like a ninja.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.283
Lightning fast with deadly
skill.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.026
Oh.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.030
I know, you're welcome.

22:17.597 --> 22:20.251
What are you kids, oh my God.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.992
Just get your clothes
on and get out of my car

22:22.036 --> 22:23.994
before I call the police.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.997
Are these yours or mine? These
are mine.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.396
Oh come on, you knew I didn't
have no car.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.789
You loved it.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.312
No, I can't say that I did.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.968
And you cannot tell anyone aboutthis.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.325
Jesus, are you psycho?

22:51.457 --> 22:52.283
Dude, where were you?

22:52.327 --> 22:53.415
Don't call me dude.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.200
I'm not your bro and it's not
4:20.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.201
What happened to your face?

22:57.245 --> 22:58.812
What were you doing?

23:00.466 --> 23:03.207
Just trying to be normal.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.209
You should try it sometime.

23:07.864 --> 23:09.475
We were supposed to do homework.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.302
Did you go to that party?

23:11.346 --> 23:12.652
Yeah, it was heinous anus.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.131
Be glad you weren't invited.

23:17.352 --> 23:18.397
You suck.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.487
Yeah, I probably do.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.331
It's her.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.296
What?

23:48.339 --> 23:49.253
Bathroom now.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.694
Is it true?

23:54.737 --> 23:56.478
You had sex with Smallie Smalls?

24:02.049 --> 24:03.485
Why?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.226
I don't know.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.575
You have failed me.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.406
Town bike?

24:12.363 --> 24:14.278
And look how he spells
Mayonnaise.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.410
Fuckin' retard.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.413
Who else has seen this?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.198
Well I've seen it, and I'm
always last.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.686
Okay, what do I do?

24:30.730 --> 24:31.948
Go home.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.776
Go to the nurse, say you have
bad cramps.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.474
I don't get my period
for another two weeks.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.128
She's not gonna check.
Right, right.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.915
I'm never gonna live this down.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.526
Maybe there'll be a shooting
later

24:44.570 --> 24:46.049
and people will forget all aboutthis.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.107
♪ Banjo I'm plunkin'

25:00.150 --> 25:01.587

Hey!

Hey, that is enough.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.210
I'll kill you, you fat bitch.

25:18.342 --> 25:21.520
Janet, we have a zero tolerancepolicy

25:21.563 --> 25:22.869
towards bullying at MorgansfieldHigh.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.784
He humiliated my friend.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.742
Your friend and her boyfriend
here

25:26.786 --> 25:30.833
having a little lover's spat
is no excuse for violence.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.313
No, no, no.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.186
And perhaps your friend should
think twice

25:36.230 --> 25:38.928
about announcing to the whole
school

25:38.972 --> 25:43.542
her personal matters the way shedid.

25:44.586 --> 25:48.459
We are going to be watching
your every move, young lady.

25:48.503 --> 25:51.288
Now, I want you both to stand
up.

25:52.594 --> 25:53.900
Come on, stand up.

25:57.425 --> 25:58.382
Look at each other.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.908
Now apologize.

26:03.823 --> 26:04.650
Do it!

26:05.825 --> 26:07.740
I sorry.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.569
I also sorry.

26:12.658 --> 26:13.484
Now hug.

26:13.528 --> 26:14.529
What?

26:14.573 --> 26:15.530
You heard me.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.110
I'm gonna kill you!
Ow!

26:32.155 --> 26:34.854
I swear to god you're gonna be
dead.

26:34.897 --> 26:35.724
Oh my god.

26:38.814 --> 26:43.819
Janet, you're a smart
girl and a good student.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.387
I think what we are dealing withhere

26:46.430 --> 26:48.911
is bigger than a little
student altercation.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.219
Now I think what we're dealing
with here

26:52.262 --> 26:53.612
is a medical problem.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.572
Let's see if we can deal with
this

26:57.616 --> 27:00.009
without too much trouble, shallwe?

27:11.107 --> 27:12.587
Dad, what's all this crap?

27:13.675 --> 27:15.546
A man from the school came by.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.678
Brought you your medicine.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.854
Says it'll help you with your
grades.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.203
Who came by?

27:20.247 --> 27:22.684
A medicine salesman, a doctor.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.125
This is stupid.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.605
I'm not gonna take it.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.173
Sweetie, you have to.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.566
If you wanna stay in school,
that's what the man said.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.049
Fuck.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.168
And in the 1980s,

28:12.212 --> 28:14.475
America gained its greatest
leader of the 20th Century.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.737
And that would be?

28:15.781 --> 28:17.347
Ronald Reagan.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.914
Correct.

28:18.958 --> 28:22.222
Ronald Reagan is the president
who deregulated the banks,

28:22.265 --> 28:25.138
allowing this country
to enjoy unprecedented

28:25.181 --> 28:27.575
corporate growth and prosperity.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.925
He also vetoed dangerous
legislation

28:29.969 --> 28:32.406
like the Clean Air Act
that would have crippled

28:32.449 --> 28:35.191
American industry in
the name of the unproven

28:35.235 --> 28:38.020
health risks of air pollution.
Ow.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.285
Is there a problem back there?

28:42.329 --> 28:43.678
No.
Well,

28:43.722 --> 28:46.420
perhaps you should go to
the principal's office

28:46.463 --> 28:49.118
if you're going to be
disrupting class like this.

28:54.558 --> 28:57.910
Ronald Reagan also created
tremendous business
opportunities

28:57.953 --> 29:01.783
by allowing the CIA to funnel
cocaine into urban areas,

29:01.827 --> 29:04.090
allowing young African
American entrepreneurs

29:04.133 --> 29:06.832
to create what?

29:06.875 --> 29:08.355
Crack cocaine.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.270
Yes, crack.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.140
Very good.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.251
I don't think this bus
stop is active anymore.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.645
Oh, I'm just counting cars.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.039
Ford Focus.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.868
Is this some kind of YouTube
thing?

31:11.521 --> 31:13.045
Subaru Outback.

31:13.088 --> 31:13.915
YouTube?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.744
Oh, right, no.

31:16.787 --> 31:17.876
It's a long story.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.618
If you're worried about your
safety, I won't be here long.

31:24.447 --> 31:25.840
My name is Rian.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.928
R-I-A-N.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.672
Sorry, I'm tripping or
something.

31:31.715 --> 31:32.542
Tripping?

31:33.456 --> 31:34.240
On drugs?

31:34.283 --> 31:35.154
Do you need a doctor?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.199
No, doctor gave them to me.

31:48.471 --> 31:52.084
So, why are you in a space?

31:52.127 --> 31:52.954
Janet?

31:55.087 --> 31:57.567
Would you like to go on a walk
with me?

31:57.611 --> 31:58.873
I didn't tell you my name.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.397
Yes you did, just right
before we shook hands.

32:05.967 --> 32:06.794
Sure.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.322
Oh, wow.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.281
Look at this.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.198
I thought these guys would
have all been killed off

32:19.241 --> 32:20.677
by pesticides by now.

32:23.811 --> 32:24.638
Make a wish.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.510
Don't tell me or it won't come
true.

32:36.737 --> 32:39.131
Aren't you hot in that suit?

32:39.174 --> 32:40.001
Well, there's germs out there

32:40.045 --> 32:42.003
that could be dangerous.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.397
May not have the immunity,
don't wanna risk it.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.534
Do you believe in UFOs?

32:51.578 --> 32:53.188
If aliens are visiting us,

32:53.232 --> 32:56.191
why is it always in some
cowboy town in New Mexico?

32:56.235 --> 32:59.107
Wouldn't they want to go
to the UN or something?

32:59.151 --> 33:01.849
Well, maybe because they're notaliens.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.329
They're us trying to hide.

33:03.372 --> 33:06.854
What, like secret government
junk?

33:07.681 --> 33:09.161
It's a mistake.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.771
That's why they never hang out.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.383
The closest galaxy that could
support life is the Andromeda,

33:14.427 --> 33:16.690
which is over two
million light years away.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.171
That's two million years of
travel.

33:19.214 --> 33:21.347
That's shitloads hella far.

33:21.390 --> 33:24.567
They would have to leave
before humans even existed.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.134
Even with faster than light
travel,

33:26.178 --> 33:29.050
which is still theoretical,
even with a Krasnikov tube,

33:29.094 --> 33:30.921
they'd come back home in five
years

33:30.965 --> 33:33.402
and 5000 years would have
passed.

33:33.446 --> 33:37.319
All your friends long
dead, nobody remembers you.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.497
And for what, Big Mac?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.196
The Grand Canyon, maybe?

33:45.936 --> 33:47.982
Not really worth the
trip, don't you think?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.028
You lost me, dude.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.336
People think time is this.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.122
But it's like this.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.080
Different times running
parallel,

33:59.124 --> 34:01.039
and sometimes they run into eachother.

34:03.171 --> 34:05.434
So, you're from the future now?

34:06.696 --> 34:09.482
What makes insane people
always wanna talk to me?

34:09.525 --> 34:11.310
Should I scowl more?
Did you ever do something

34:11.353 --> 34:12.398
that changed the whole course

34:12.440 --> 34:13.703
of your life from that moment
on?

34:15.313 --> 34:17.011
Or when things get weird

34:17.054 --> 34:19.318
and you think who's life is
this?

34:19.360 --> 34:20.493
Maybe you just slipped

34:20.536 --> 34:22.495
into one of your alternate timelines.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.583
You mean like right now?

34:24.627 --> 34:25.585
I'm time traveling?

34:25.628 --> 34:26.455
Well, sure.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.197
We're all time travelers.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.068
One, two,

34:31.199 --> 34:32.199
three, four.

34:34.159 --> 34:38.424
There we go, traveling
through time into the future.

34:39.902 --> 34:42.428
I think I'm too high for any ofthis.

34:42.471 --> 34:43.864
You're just a side effect
anyway.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.387
I'm imagining you.

34:50.478 --> 34:51.306
Ow.

34:53.612 --> 34:54.831
You sure I'm not real?

34:58.226 --> 35:00.185
I think I should be going home
now.

35:06.234 --> 35:10.630
I'm trippin' my tits off.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.851
I've never been outside so long.

35:14.895 --> 35:19.900
I feel sort of exposed.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.129
Janet.

35:32.434 --> 35:33.261
Janet.

35:54.413 --> 35:56.154
Time to get up, kiddo.

36:13.736 --> 36:14.607
Hey.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.652
Thanks for remembering I exist.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.612
Sorry, I'm freaking out.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.181
Can't decide which rad party togo to?

36:25.574 --> 36:27.097
I'm pregnant.

36:27.141 --> 36:28.664
What?

36:28.708 --> 36:30.188
Are you sure?

36:30.231 --> 36:31.711
I took the test.

36:32.625 --> 36:35.932
No way, I thought loser
face used a condom.

36:36.977 --> 36:40.285
I think he didn't, he just saidhe did.

36:40.328 --> 36:41.851
How hard do you want me
to hit him this time?

36:41.895 --> 36:43.244
No, he can't know.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.072
What are you gonna do?

36:45.115 --> 36:48.249
I don't know, I'm
thinking about keeping it.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.034
Yeah, 'cause every kid wants

36:51.078 --> 36:53.341
to be born to a 17 year old
and some random douchebag.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.125
No, that's the point.

36:55.169 --> 36:59.695
Maybe I can be the world's worstmom ever.

36:59.739 --> 37:02.307
Name it Hitler, cover
it with prison tattoos,

37:02.350 --> 37:05.353
really go all out with
it like an art project.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.094
You've had better ideas.

37:08.356 --> 37:11.185
If I go to the clinic,
will you come with me?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.099
My mom can't know.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.536
Her and Vlad will fucking flip.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.147
Yes, stupid questioner.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.933
Can you come over?

37:19.976 --> 37:21.021
And bring ice cream?

37:22.501 --> 37:24.154
Maybe.

37:24.198 --> 37:29.159
♪ I was there I heard the
crackling of the palms ♪

37:30.900 --> 37:33.076
♪ He came upstairs
Whoa.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.253
Was that Mr. Muckles?

37:35.296 --> 37:36.079
Uh huh.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.690
It's a miracle.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.910
I've known you 10 years and
I've seen that cat like twice.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.260
Maybe it's a bad sign.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.837
Two coats of paint and they
still glow.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.276
Deadly radiation killing us
both.

38:03.019 --> 38:04.456
Childhood refusing to leave

38:04.499 --> 38:06.022
even when asked nicely.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.300
Ms. Nuemann?
One second.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.086
I'm going to take you to
the see the doctor now.

38:26.129 --> 38:29.568
Is there anything you'd like
to say or any second thoughts?

38:29.611 --> 38:30.569
No.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.571
Do you have a ride home?

38:32.614 --> 38:34.790
And you don't have any
allergies to medication?

38:34.834 --> 38:36.966
No, just peanut butter.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.318
There are no peanuts
involved in the procedure.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.279
Dr. Blake?

38:45.323 --> 38:46.149
Hello, Katrine.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.718
You can't tell my mom about
this.

38:49.762 --> 38:52.678
My work here at the Woman's
Clinic is private and separate

38:52.721 --> 38:54.897
from my job as your family
pediatrician.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.685
I won't tell your mother.

39:04.167 --> 39:08.433
Y'know, I will never get over
my patients becoming adults.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.348
Seems like sooner every year.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.351
Sorry.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.179
I have eight year olds
menstruating.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.137
Yikes.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.443
I blame Fruit Roll-Ups.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.315
Anyway,

39:21.359 --> 39:23.839
how are you?

39:23.883 --> 39:25.145
Okay.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.755
Nervous.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.105
We're give you a mild
sedative, that should help.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.675
Are you gonna get me hopped
up on goofballs, Dr. Blake?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.155
No.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.070
No goofballs today, I'm afraid.

39:42.336 --> 39:47.341
Now Katrine, what we are
about to do is safe and legal.

39:47.646 --> 39:50.300
State law does not require
your parental consent

39:50.344 --> 39:52.172
or their knowledge of this
procedure.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.828
However, due to recent
changes in federal law,

39:55.871 --> 39:58.700
a police officer is required tobe here

39:58.744 --> 40:01.442
every time I do a procedure

40:01.486 --> 40:03.792
on an unmarried patient under
21.

40:20.505 --> 40:21.810
At your cervix.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.305
Quack, quack.

40:38.348 --> 40:39.828
Hello, Katrine.

40:44.529 --> 40:48.358
You're gonna feel a little
pressure, like a tummy ache.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.892
How's that sedative working?

41:07.508 --> 41:08.683
That's a good girl.

41:09.684 --> 41:10.468
Almost done.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.123
Almost.

41:35.710 --> 41:38.278
Three feet back, folks, that's
the law.

41:38.321 --> 41:39.584
Three feet back.

41:42.587 --> 41:44.806
You killed your baby, you whore!

41:44.850 --> 41:45.894
Shut up!

41:45.938 --> 41:47.200
You're going to go to hell.
Shut up!

41:47.243 --> 41:49.942
Murderer, murderer!

41:49.985 --> 41:54.947
I'm never having sex
again or anything else.

41:54.990 --> 41:55.817
Ever again.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.125
It's all gonna be fine.

43:42.750 --> 43:44.534
The definition of a traitor is
someone

43:44.578 --> 43:47.276
who betrays a country
or a sacred institution.

43:48.190 --> 43:49.888
A traitor is especially
dangerous

43:49.931 --> 43:51.803
because they destroy from where?

43:53.413 --> 43:54.414
From within.

43:57.678 --> 43:59.506
History has given us many famoustraitors

43:59.549 --> 44:02.683
whose treacherous deeds have
killed

44:02.727 --> 44:05.686
and corrupted untold lives.

44:05.730 --> 44:07.993
Judas, Benedict Arnold,

44:08.036 --> 44:11.083
Mata Hari, Jane Fonda.

44:11.126 --> 44:13.433
But none so deadly as the man

44:13.476 --> 44:16.001
you probably have already heardof,

44:16.915 --> 44:21.484
a dictator whose face and
name shall live in infamy.

44:22.703 --> 44:26.664
A man who, not so long ago,
a whole nation of wayward,

44:26.707 --> 44:30.972
supposedly civilized people
supported and even championed

44:31.016 --> 44:34.236
despite his evil, evil deeds.

44:42.462 --> 44:43.942
William Jefferson Clinton.

44:58.478 --> 45:00.088
How can they send you to sex
rehab

45:00.132 --> 45:01.829
when you've barely had sex?

45:03.309 --> 45:04.702
I hate growing up.

45:04.745 --> 45:06.747
Your mother's the devil.

45:06.791 --> 45:08.706
She's not that bad.
Fine.

45:08.749 --> 45:10.185
The devil's doula, then.

45:12.361 --> 45:14.276
Your mother's crazy.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.496
Yeah, ever since she
went through the change,

45:16.539 --> 45:19.281
she got that PBS totebag
and it was all over.

45:19.325 --> 45:21.457
The sure sign of menopause.

45:21.501 --> 45:22.763
How long will you be gone?

45:22.807 --> 45:25.810
They won't tell me, till I get
better.

45:27.115 --> 45:29.988
You are not a sex addict.

45:30.031 --> 45:31.685
She says that one of the signs

45:31.729 --> 45:33.469
of sex addiction is lying aboutit.

45:34.557 --> 45:37.038
No one's honest with
their parents about sex.

45:37.082 --> 45:38.474
Hey Mom, I'm going to the
football game

45:38.518 --> 45:40.520
to blow the starting lineup
behind the bleachers,

45:40.563 --> 45:42.217
be home by 11.

45:42.261 --> 45:43.436
Yeah.

45:43.479 --> 45:44.916
Will you visit me?

45:44.959 --> 45:46.787
It's like three hours away
and I won't have internet.

45:46.831 --> 45:48.354
Of course I'll visit.

45:49.398 --> 45:51.792
Mom and Vlad will just buy a dog

45:51.836 --> 45:53.576
and pretend I never happened.

46:05.632 --> 46:06.459
Hey.

46:07.852 --> 46:09.331
Excuse me, can we?

46:26.696 --> 46:28.611
Katrine, I know I failed you.

46:29.656 --> 46:30.744
If I was a good mother,

46:30.788 --> 46:32.920
we would have talked about thesethings.

46:32.964 --> 46:35.967
Mistakes you've made, mistakes
I've made.

46:37.185 --> 46:39.361
But at least now, before you goaway,

46:39.405 --> 46:40.798
we have some time to do that.

46:41.755 --> 46:43.626
Mom, is that really necessary?

46:43.670 --> 46:47.456
Yes, yeah it is.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.850
As long as we have.
You have four hours,

46:49.894 --> 46:52.505
29 minutes to your destination.

46:52.548 --> 46:55.203
As long as we have these
four hours and 29 minutes

46:55.247 --> 46:57.640
together we're gonna make the
most of it.

47:02.732 --> 47:04.473
Look, I'm old.

47:04.517 --> 47:07.041
When I was your age, the
rainbow hanging in the window

47:07.085 --> 47:08.782
of a store meant that
they sold televisions

47:08.826 --> 47:09.739
that were in color.

47:10.653 --> 47:13.831
I don't pretend to know what a
popular,

47:13.874 --> 47:17.530
beautiful young woman goes
through in the 21st century.

47:17.573 --> 47:19.140
Perhaps you can enlighten me.

47:20.533 --> 47:21.926
Well, I guess you'd have to asksomeone

47:21.969 --> 47:24.015
who was popular and beautiful.

47:26.365 --> 47:28.802
Why are you avoiding this
intimate

47:28.846 --> 47:30.891
mother daughter bonding time?

47:30.935 --> 47:32.197
Why?

47:32.240 --> 47:33.067
Why?

47:34.503 --> 47:35.330
Dammit.

47:40.945 --> 47:42.468
Okay.

47:42.511 --> 47:44.731
If you can't be honest with
me, I'll be honest with you.

47:45.732 --> 47:46.776
You know how I told your father

47:46.820 --> 47:48.430
I got herpes from a yoga mat?

47:50.476 --> 47:51.303
Well, I didn't.

47:53.783 --> 47:55.524
Let's just leave it at that.

47:55.568 --> 47:58.049

49:08.858 --> 49:09.772
16.

49:10.773 --> 49:14.342
Okay, I'll explain it to you
again.

49:14.386 --> 49:17.998
Emotionally, socially, men
are actually 10 years younger

49:18.042 --> 49:19.565
than their actual age.

49:19.608 --> 49:23.786
So by that rule, a 34 year
old man would actually be 24,

49:23.830 --> 49:28.748
and therefore your current
sex partner is how old?

49:30.750 --> 49:32.273
Six.

49:32.317 --> 49:33.144
See?

49:34.623 --> 49:36.930
Don't you wish we'd had
this conversation sooner?

49:47.723 --> 49:49.464
Welcome.

49:49.508 --> 49:51.858
Okay, I want to start by
everyone giving

49:51.901 --> 49:54.687
a short description, or even
just a word,

49:54.730 --> 49:56.167
of the incident or the moment

49:56.210 --> 49:58.647
where you realized you needed toget help.

50:02.434 --> 50:06.438
I spent my wife and I's entire
401K

50:06.481 --> 50:10.485
in the VIP room at Mr.
Dandy's, a strip club.

50:10.529 --> 50:12.096
In one weekend.
Mr. Dandy's?

50:13.184 --> 50:14.054
Who'd you see?

50:14.098 --> 50:15.664
Brandy, Veronica?

50:15.708 --> 50:17.231
Let's stay focused, please.

50:18.711 --> 50:23.324
Well at work, I was too
busy pleasuring myself

50:23.368 --> 50:28.025
instead of doing my job, andpeople were hurt because of it.

50:28.068 --> 50:29.983
What's your job, Dan?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.028
Was my job.

50:31.898 --> 50:33.595
High speed train conductor.

50:35.206 --> 50:39.993
Four words, talk now to live
girls.

50:40.863 --> 50:43.344
Uh, that's five words but thankyou, Phil.

50:44.519 --> 50:47.870
Foreign objects lost in my
rectum.

50:47.914 --> 50:49.133
Thank you, Wayne.

50:49.176 --> 50:50.917
Had to go to the hospital.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.831
Yes, we see.

50:54.660 --> 50:57.228
I don't think I really belong
here.

50:57.271 --> 50:59.926
Obviously, you're alone in thatopinion.

50:59.969 --> 51:02.320
I've had sex with, like, two
guys.

51:02.363 --> 51:06.585
It's not how you have
sex, it's how sex has you.

51:07.890 --> 51:09.153
Everyone here needs to be honest

51:09.196 --> 51:11.329
with themselves and with each
other.

51:13.722 --> 51:17.074
Okay, I slept with a jerk from
my school

51:17.117 --> 51:19.685
because I was bored.

51:19.728 --> 51:21.904
I got high and I guess
I thought he was funny.

51:24.037 --> 51:25.169
Better, thank you.

51:28.694 --> 51:30.348
Neighbor's Saint Bernard.

51:49.410 --> 51:51.586
Janet, what are you doing?

51:58.071 --> 51:59.028
Watching TV, Dad.

52:27.231 --> 52:29.407
We can't do this, they're
gonna kick us out.

52:29.450 --> 52:32.192
No, it's okay, I have
my cloaking device on.

52:32.236 --> 52:33.672
As long as you're within six
feet of me,

52:33.715 --> 52:34.847
no one can see us.

52:36.283 --> 52:38.111
I'm sorry, this is just weird.

52:38.155 --> 52:39.286
I don't even go to real dances.

52:39.330 --> 52:41.506
That's why it'll be fun.

52:43.464 --> 52:45.814
Miss, can I help you?

52:45.858 --> 52:48.339
Nope, no, just leaving.

52:56.129 --> 52:57.261
You're nuts.

52:57.304 --> 52:59.263
Just keep dancing, nobody'll
notice.

53:03.832 --> 53:07.619
So, what do you dream about?

53:09.098 --> 53:10.883
Last night I was riding a giantspoon

53:10.926 --> 53:14.408
that plunged into a lake of
Mrs. Freshy's cake frosting.

53:14.452 --> 53:17.106
No, like something you want to
happen.

53:18.369 --> 53:19.457
World peace?

53:19.500 --> 53:21.110
Something attainable.

53:21.154 --> 53:22.111
An end forever to the scourge

53:22.155 --> 53:23.635
of the backwards baseball cap.

53:27.465 --> 53:28.640
How about in guys?

53:30.294 --> 53:31.817
What do you like, tall, short?

53:32.644 --> 53:34.341
Brown, yellow, green?

53:34.385 --> 53:35.951
Someone who doesn't annoy me.

53:38.476 --> 53:41.435
They can't use the word gay to
describe something they hate.

53:43.568 --> 53:45.526
Someone who's not afraid
to hold my hand in public

53:45.570 --> 53:47.180
even though I have fat fingers,

53:50.705 --> 53:52.490
who looks me in the eyes when Italk

53:54.840 --> 53:56.189
and smiles when I'm telling a
story,

53:56.233 --> 53:58.191
even though I haven't got
to the funny part yet.

53:59.323 --> 54:00.454
Dumb stuff like that.

54:05.416 --> 54:08.810
And what do you dream about?

54:09.985 --> 54:10.769
You.

54:18.907 --> 54:21.780
Maybe next time we can
do this with my suit off.

54:21.823 --> 54:23.695
I wouldn't want to get you sick.

54:24.696 --> 54:26.524
I think you're worth the risk.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.790
I don't have your phone number.

54:31.833 --> 54:34.271
Why would you assume that
I have a cellular phone?

54:35.663 --> 54:37.186
I mean,

54:37.230 --> 54:40.538
I'm kind of sad I wasn't
born in the time before TVs.

54:40.581 --> 54:41.974
People had to use their
imaginations,

54:42.017 --> 54:44.716
cook, talk to each other, leavethe house.

54:44.759 --> 54:45.804
Just thought I'd ask.

54:45.847 --> 54:46.761
Cell phones are bad for
humanity.

54:46.805 --> 54:48.154
I get it.

54:48.197 --> 54:50.112
I know where you live, though.

54:50.156 --> 54:50.983
Okay.

54:52.114 --> 54:54.334
I guess it's more fun this way.

54:54.378 --> 54:55.204
Sorta.

55:13.092 --> 55:14.180
Katrine, it's Phil.

55:14.223 --> 55:15.486
Are you awake?

55:16.704 --> 55:18.227
And Mike.

55:19.359 --> 55:21.405
We just want to hang out and
talk.

55:21.448 --> 55:22.928
Are you asleep?

55:22.971 --> 55:25.104
We're not gonna touch you.

55:25.147 --> 55:26.801
Unless you really want us to.

55:26.845 --> 55:29.587
Yeah, if you want us to, that'scool.

55:29.630 --> 55:31.066
I mean, that'd be totally
awesome.

55:31.110 --> 55:33.373
You don't have to make
that decision right now.

55:33.417 --> 55:36.028
Yeah, yeah, just let us come
inside.

55:53.219 --> 55:55.352
Where's the visiting place?

55:55.395 --> 55:56.875
I can't have visitors.

55:56.918 --> 55:58.006
What?

55:58.050 --> 56:00.357
I spent five hours on the bus.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.533
I know, I know, we're in
lockdown.

56:02.576 --> 56:03.708
I'm not supposed to have my
phone, either.

56:03.751 --> 56:04.926
They catch me and--
What?

56:04.970 --> 56:06.101
Why?

56:06.145 --> 56:07.102
One of the guys got caught

56:07.146 --> 56:08.408
with a Victoria's Secret catalog

56:08.452 --> 56:11.411
and they have this zero
tolerance porn policy.

56:11.455 --> 56:14.153
So I'm just supposed to go home?

56:14.196 --> 56:16.416
I see you, come to the
window on the right.

56:18.897 --> 56:20.202
Come out.

56:20.246 --> 56:22.074
I can't hear you.

56:22.117 --> 56:23.467
Come out.

56:23.510 --> 56:27.514
We're in lockdown, and
they're tracking my phone.

56:42.660 --> 56:44.096
I've been busy.

56:52.670 --> 56:55.542
I'm on Femtrexl, it
makes it hard to think.

56:58.197 --> 57:00.808
I met a guy, at least I think Idid.

57:07.685 --> 57:08.512
His name's Rian.

57:10.035 --> 57:11.297
He's from the future.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.086
I don't even know if he's real.

57:28.967 --> 57:29.750
Maybe.

57:32.231 --> 57:33.798
Are you?

57:33.841 --> 57:36.061
Katrine Neumann, we know you'redown here.

57:36.104 --> 57:37.192
You have to get me out of here,

57:37.236 --> 57:39.847
it's like prison but with worsepeople.

57:39.891 --> 57:40.718
How?

57:41.719 --> 57:43.242
Why aren't you helping me?
Oh my god.

57:43.285 --> 57:46.332
You were supposed to be my
friend, Janet.

57:46.375 --> 57:47.942
Fuck off me!

57:47.986 --> 57:49.161
Kat!

57:53.339 --> 57:54.166
Shit!

58:03.349 --> 58:04.698
Hey, it's Kat.

58:04.742 --> 58:05.612
Leave a message.

58:18.407 --> 58:20.322
If you're calling me,
you're probably someone

58:20.366 --> 58:22.542
who abandoned me and let
me down when I needed you.

58:22.586 --> 58:24.849
Take a good look at
yourself in the mirror.

58:24.892 --> 58:26.328
You know who you are.

58:26.372 --> 58:28.809
Don't leave a message because
I won't call you back.

01:00:04.165 --> 01:00:05.776
Sorry to scare you.

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:07.255
I thought it'd be romantic to
just come through the window.

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:10.041
Yeah, kidnappers and rapists,
every girl's favorite.

01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:11.520
Can you help me?

01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:12.391
Sure.

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:19.659
I missed you, Janet.

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:20.965
I missed you, too.

01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:23.489
I think about you all the time.

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:25.273
It's like I'm obsessed with you.

01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:26.884
Thanks, I guess.

01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:28.973
Me, too.

01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:41.507
Are you alone?

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:43.901
My dad's downstairs
listening to books on tape.

01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:44.989
He can't hear us.

01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:53.127
I've never done this before.

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.391
It's okay, if you don't want.

01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.538
I don't know anything about you.

01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:14.018
What else do you need to know?

01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.716
Are you real?

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.196
Reality is anything the majority

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:19.632
of people agree to be true.

01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:22.591
Why do you say that?

01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:23.897
I only see you when I take my
meds.

01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:25.290
You take your meds a lot.

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:28.989
Do you think I'm real?

01:01:31.383 --> 01:01:33.385
Well, so do I.

01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:36.127
And we're the majority.

01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:38.782
Good enough for me.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:47.704
Do you wanna take off
the, you must be hot.

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:50.663
Sure, yeah.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.533
So far, so good.

01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:20.301
This is unexpected, but.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.800
Are you okay?

01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:44.108
I'm sorry.

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:46.806
It's fine.
