WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.580
(dramatic tense music)

00:15.593 --> 00:20.593
(bright pensive music)
(mysterious whooshing)

00:37.152 --> 00:40.012
-  This day wasn't
particularly a good one for him.

00:40.062 --> 00:41.911
He was 10 minutes late for the train,

00:41.961 --> 00:43.652
and as a result, he had
to take the next one

00:43.702 --> 00:46.031
that left an hour later.

00:46.081 --> 00:48.369
The schedule that he had
meticulously planned for the day

00:48.419 --> 00:51.810
fell to the wayside, but
it didn't matter to him.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.372
He knew that if he had to live his life

00:53.422 --> 00:56.223
by times and rhythms, that
he could never achieve

00:56.273 --> 00:58.372
what it was that he wanted.

00:58.422 --> 01:00.961
At least, not in any satisfactory way

01:01.011 --> 01:02.252
that he could wake up the next day

01:02.302 --> 01:05.143
and felt that he had
achieved enough to move on.

01:05.193 --> 01:07.280
(soft tense music)

01:07.330 --> 01:10.080
(woman grunting)

01:25.486 --> 01:28.909
He nevertheless had achieved
what he had wanted that day,

01:28.959 --> 01:31.848
and felt that he could
take a breath and sit.

01:31.898 --> 01:34.269
Tomorrow was another day, and the dread of

01:34.319 --> 01:35.728
and responsibilities of tomorrow

01:35.778 --> 01:37.538
would keep him up this night.

01:37.588 --> 01:40.505
(soft tense music)

01:41.365 --> 01:43.658
This day was very different for him.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.557
He vowed every night that
he would change his ways.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.429
He told himself this every night,

01:48.479 --> 01:50.528
and truly believed that he could change.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.495
(soft tense music)

01:54.788 --> 01:58.309
Yes, he wanted to change,
he wanted to be different.

01:58.359 --> 02:03.026
(upbeat rock music with man vocalizing)

02:08.098 --> 02:09.808
- You like that, don't you?

02:09.858 --> 02:11.746
Love those old-fashioned tape machines.

02:11.796 --> 02:14.026
We don't sell much of those anymore.

02:14.076 --> 02:16.666
I gotta be honest with you, you know,

02:16.716 --> 02:19.456
it's all landfill now,
those old tape machines.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.506
(upbeat rock music)

02:27.003 --> 02:27.836
- My baby.

02:30.096 --> 02:33.263
(laughing maniacally)

02:37.317 --> 02:39.195
- The other advantage
is jerkin' off to porn,

02:39.245 --> 02:41.675
you know the digital
stuff runs a little fast.

02:41.725 --> 02:45.246
I've still got my old VHS
stash to jerk off to. (laughs)

02:45.296 --> 02:48.614
(upbeat rock music with man vocalizing)

02:48.664 --> 02:49.914
You interested?

02:50.865 --> 02:52.366
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take it.

02:52.416 --> 02:54.075
- Cool, 150 bucks.

02:54.125 --> 02:58.006
(upbeat rock music with man vocalizing)

02:58.056 --> 02:58.856
-  But the impulse was too strong

02:58.906 --> 03:00.816
that it overtook him.

03:00.866 --> 03:04.576
Once he had crossed that
line, there was no going back.

03:04.626 --> 03:08.886
He had done this before,
but day 11 was different.

03:08.936 --> 03:11.063
Day 11 was significant

03:11.113 --> 03:14.304
because he had felt something
for her, something genuine.

03:14.354 --> 03:16.264
(man screaming)

03:16.314 --> 03:19.653
He remembered how he first met her.

03:19.703 --> 03:22.872
This was the decision that
would change his life forever.

03:22.922 --> 03:27.589
(upbeat rock music with man vocalizing)

04:11.657 --> 04:14.740
(train whooshing by)

04:16.677 --> 04:19.760
(muffled chattering)

04:48.901 --> 04:51.234
That's an old one, isn't it?

04:52.981 --> 04:53.791
- Yeah.

04:53.841 --> 04:58.260
- (laughs) That's tape, right?

04:58.310 --> 05:00.810
You know, like Betamax or VHS?

05:02.329 --> 05:03.162
- Yeah.

05:04.969 --> 05:09.210
- My dad has stacks and
decks sitting in his closet.

05:09.260 --> 05:11.677
Hasn't used it in many years.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.210
He has a lotta cool stuff.

05:15.260 --> 05:18.831
I used to see his tapes
scattered on the floor.

05:18.881 --> 05:20.580
- You still close to your dad?

05:20.630 --> 05:21.463
- Yeah.

05:22.940 --> 05:25.975
Yeah, he's saved me a lotta times.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.525
(tense music)

05:30.247 --> 05:31.106
No!

05:31.156 --> 05:33.656
(tense music)

05:35.377 --> 05:36.160
No!

05:36.210 --> 05:39.397
(tense music)

05:39.447 --> 05:42.197
(Jeanie gasping)

05:47.377 --> 05:48.210
- Saved?

05:50.524 --> 05:51.441
- You know.

05:53.415 --> 05:55.325
-  How old are you?

05:55.375 --> 05:56.208
- 17.

05:59.036 --> 06:02.536
Well, I don't mean he saved me like Jesus.

06:03.521 --> 06:07.794
(laughs) I just mean that
when I fell down during times,

06:07.844 --> 06:10.103
you know, like difficult
times in the past?

06:10.153 --> 06:12.653
(tense music)

06:14.022 --> 06:17.855
(Jeanie gasping and grunting)

06:20.052 --> 06:23.052
(Brandon screaming)

06:30.942 --> 06:32.411
- But you're only 17.

06:32.461 --> 06:34.023
- And?

06:34.073 --> 06:37.012
(Brandon scoffs)

06:37.062 --> 06:37.895
Well.

06:40.172 --> 06:43.171
My father's been the only
one I can look up to.

06:43.221 --> 06:46.138
He has saved me, he has rescued me.

06:50.193 --> 06:52.776
I have no faith in anyone else.

06:53.692 --> 06:56.093
My friends are all backstabbers.

06:56.143 --> 06:58.642
- So you don't have real friends?

06:58.692 --> 06:59.525
- Real?

07:01.292 --> 07:02.125
No.

07:03.663 --> 07:06.246
- Nobody you can count on then?

07:07.103 --> 07:08.603
- I give too much,

07:12.124 --> 07:14.362
and they let me down.

07:14.412 --> 07:15.693
- How does that make you feel?

07:15.743 --> 07:17.442
- How would you feel if
your bestie fucked your BF

07:17.492 --> 07:20.543
and didn't give a shit about you?

07:20.593 --> 07:21.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:24.623 --> 07:29.290
Now, a friend is someone you
can just confess things to.

07:31.411 --> 07:34.903
Like, I can say I want to kill my mom,

07:34.953 --> 07:37.953
or fuck my brother, and that's that.

07:42.351 --> 07:45.339
It's like I can't say
anything to anyone anymore,

07:45.389 --> 07:48.306
and I don't even have any feelings.

07:49.307 --> 07:53.399
My friends reject me because
I don't go to church.

07:53.449 --> 07:55.866
Sometimes I wish I could just

07:57.390 --> 07:58.223
fly away.

08:02.521 --> 08:05.021
Brandon knew he had found her.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.921
(upbeat rock music)

08:18.222 --> 08:21.031
(Brandon screaming)

08:21.081 --> 08:23.831
(Brandon crying)

08:33.915 --> 08:36.832
(Brandon laughing)

08:38.552 --> 08:41.552
(Brandon screaming)

08:42.954 --> 08:45.871
(Brandon laughing)

08:47.231 --> 08:49.213
(Brandon panting)

08:49.263 --> 08:52.180
(Brandon laughing)

08:56.710 --> 08:59.710
(Brandon screaming)

09:00.901 --> 09:03.818
(Brandon laughing)

09:08.170 --> 09:09.170
- I beg you.

09:11.741 --> 09:13.062
Why are you doing this?

09:13.112 --> 09:17.695
(upbeat music with warbled vocalizing)

09:18.701 --> 09:20.201
No, don't do that.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.753
Please. (screaming)

09:23.803 --> 09:27.971
(upbeat music with warbled vocalizing)

09:28.021 --> 09:30.854
(woman screaming)

09:34.920 --> 09:35.753
Stop!

09:37.319 --> 09:38.781
(Brandon screaming)

09:38.831 --> 09:41.831
(upbeat rock music)

09:52.256 --> 09:54.839
(woman crying)

09:56.834 --> 10:00.667
(Brandon laughing maniacally)

10:48.996 --> 10:51.996
- Your dad, he isn't doing too well.

10:53.805 --> 10:55.388
- You spoke to him?

10:56.585 --> 10:58.668
- He called from Memphis.

10:59.566 --> 11:04.566
I guess all that drinking and
binging finally got to him,

11:04.700 --> 11:05.700
the bastard.

11:08.054 --> 11:09.554
He needs dialysis.

11:11.086 --> 11:13.003
That's the least of it.

11:14.584 --> 11:16.167
He asked about you.

11:20.326 --> 11:23.305
He hopes you find something to do,

11:23.355 --> 11:25.876
something on your own,

11:25.926 --> 11:27.926
without me enabling you.

11:31.807 --> 11:33.890
He says you're a failure,

11:36.167 --> 11:38.500
and you need to accept that.

11:40.196 --> 11:41.858
And do something.

11:41.908 --> 11:45.575
(melancholic pensive music)

12:35.292 --> 12:38.450
(cell phone vibrating)

12:38.500 --> 12:39.512
-  Hey, you.

12:39.562 --> 12:41.381
-  Hey.

12:41.431 --> 12:43.762
-  So my mom,

12:43.812 --> 12:46.895
she's such a fucking bitch, you know?

12:48.751 --> 12:51.168
It's just this disconnection.

12:52.932 --> 12:56.180
I don't think she
understands anything anymore.

12:56.230 --> 12:59.147
I'm doing the best I can, you know?

13:00.980 --> 13:01.813
- Yeah.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.181
-  I don't have any friends.

13:07.231 --> 13:08.148
I just need

13:09.582 --> 13:11.999
someone to talk to some time.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.482
I don't have anyone.

13:16.532 --> 13:17.782
- Yeah, I know.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.292
- Yeah, I don't think Mom wants
me to finish school at all.

13:24.342 --> 13:28.213
I don't think she wants me to stay here.

13:28.263 --> 13:31.839
Dressed like as a fucking
whore, (mumbles) all her life.

13:31.889 --> 13:34.536
I don't know what she
sees in those track guys.

13:34.586 --> 13:35.669
- Track guys?

13:36.769 --> 13:37.925
- You know, the guys
that run in their shorts

13:37.975 --> 13:39.642
for miles and miles.

13:40.488 --> 13:42.647
I don't really know
the point of it anyway,

13:42.697 --> 13:45.399
to run all those miles and
wear off your body like that,

13:45.449 --> 13:46.679
yeah, only to say you're the winner.

13:46.729 --> 13:49.727
Like, what is winning anyway?

13:49.777 --> 13:54.046
I won, well, I sorta won
the spelling bee one year.

13:54.096 --> 13:56.399
I was second place.

13:56.449 --> 13:58.282
They gave me a plaque.

13:59.886 --> 14:03.833
I don't even know where it is anymore.

14:03.883 --> 14:06.383
Mom wasn't really proud of it.

14:07.659 --> 14:09.711
She said the judges cheated
and that Chinese girl

14:09.761 --> 14:12.261
from Monrovia should have won.

14:14.599 --> 14:17.182
She didn't like that I had won.

14:18.851 --> 14:22.101
(cell phone vibrating)

14:23.451 --> 14:24.284
Hmm.

14:25.171 --> 14:29.254
Jesse's texting me now,
wants to know where I am.

14:36.782 --> 14:39.782
(crickets chirping)

14:43.321 --> 14:45.654
Wanna be at that star there.

14:47.589 --> 14:48.422
That star

14:50.950 --> 14:53.511
is the furthest one away.

14:53.561 --> 14:54.394
- Mm-mm.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.871
That's the closest one.

14:57.921 --> 15:00.601
Furthest one is the big one right there.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.721
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

15:02.771 --> 15:03.604
- Huh.

15:05.470 --> 15:09.389
- I mean, why be far away when
you can be close by, right?

15:09.439 --> 15:13.100

18:26.211 --> 18:28.628
Dahlia, I wanted to call you.

18:30.941 --> 18:32.721
It's been too long.

18:32.771 --> 18:35.102
I know I should have reached out sooner

18:35.152 --> 18:39.131
but this week has been incredibly insane.

18:39.181 --> 18:40.598
You have no idea.

18:43.963 --> 18:46.463
I wonder, how's Ophelia doing?

18:48.045 --> 18:50.045
I miss her, is she okay?

18:51.111 --> 18:52.182
How are her grades?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.815
Is she eating okay?

18:55.614 --> 18:59.153
I know, I'm asking too many questions.

18:59.203 --> 19:00.444
I'm really sorry, my dear.

19:00.494 --> 19:02.661
I love you, you know that.

19:03.990 --> 19:07.484
(sighs) I don't know.

19:07.534 --> 19:11.804
Do you think that we could
attempt to be together again,

19:11.854 --> 19:13.981
at least for Ophelia?

19:14.031 --> 19:16.531
Maybe we can make it work out.

19:18.294 --> 19:23.294
(sighs) My job's promoting
me to a big case now,

19:23.331 --> 19:27.222
and things will be better financially.

19:27.272 --> 19:29.273
I've amassed quite a bit of savings,

19:29.323 --> 19:31.689
so no more excess anymore, my love.

19:31.739 --> 19:32.822
I just wonder

19:37.670 --> 19:41.150
if we could give this another chance.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.238
(sighs) After all we've been through.

19:44.288 --> 19:46.955
(pensive music)

19:53.159 --> 19:55.659
(tense music)

20:14.278 --> 20:17.595
(man screaming)

20:17.645 --> 20:19.398
- (yelling) Come on, man!

20:19.448 --> 20:21.660
Why don't you do a seizure for once?

20:21.710 --> 20:23.001
Shut up!
- Well, well, well,

20:23.051 --> 20:24.281
look what we have here.

20:24.331 --> 20:26.811
- Right, nice, that'll buy you
a few years, won't it, huh?

20:26.861 --> 20:27.982
-  All the evidence we need.

20:28.032 --> 20:29.902
(man grunting)

20:29.952 --> 20:30.735
Shut up!

20:30.785 --> 20:33.641
(man grunting)

20:33.691 --> 20:34.474
Keep gettin' him. (laughs)

20:34.524 --> 20:36.522
(Robert mumbling)

20:36.572 --> 20:38.751
-  Fuck you, cock sucker!

20:38.801 --> 20:39.871
Fuck you!

20:39.921 --> 20:40.772
-  Hey, hey!

20:40.822 --> 20:42.285
- Yeah, fuck you.

20:42.335 --> 20:45.502
(tense pensive music)

20:49.254 --> 20:52.045
-  Bugger off, wanker!

20:52.095 --> 20:52.995
-  I said shut up!

20:53.045 --> 20:55.628
- Who are you calling a wanker?

20:56.636 --> 20:57.975
(telephone ringing)

20:58.025 --> 21:01.108
(muffled chattering)

21:25.222 --> 21:27.019
- Detective, here's your papers.

21:27.069 --> 21:28.191
Is there anything else you need?

21:28.241 --> 21:29.831
- No, that's great, thank you, Samantha.

21:29.881 --> 21:30.780
- How's your boyfriend?

21:30.830 --> 21:31.699
- Good.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.749
(Tim clicks tongue)

21:36.881 --> 21:38.583
-  This is a new prototype.

21:38.633 --> 21:39.863
Even the gangs and the Chinese

21:39.913 --> 21:43.119
haven't been able to get
ahold of this one yet.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.321
Pretty soon, we'll be using these on duty.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.048
- Come off it, Tim, really?

21:47.098 --> 21:49.947
- Yeah, anything's possible, isn't it?

21:49.997 --> 21:52.176
I mean, would you have predicted

21:52.226 --> 21:53.815
any of this that's happened,

21:53.865 --> 21:55.968
cars that drive themselves,

21:56.018 --> 21:57.998
phones that know what you wanna eat next,

21:58.048 --> 22:00.546
what music you're gonna listen to?

22:00.596 --> 22:03.227
Guess no real reason for
any of us to exist, right?

22:03.277 --> 22:05.638
I can't even predict this kinda thing.

22:05.688 --> 22:06.827
-  That's great.

22:06.877 --> 22:09.576
- It was really catching
that pervert last week.

22:09.626 --> 22:10.626
- Which one?

22:11.528 --> 22:13.153
(tense music)

22:13.203 --> 22:16.083
- The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

22:16.133 --> 22:20.031
but I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

22:20.081 --> 22:21.914
- The wood are lovely,

22:22.933 --> 22:24.100
dark and deep.

22:25.413 --> 22:27.694
And I have promise to keep.

22:27.744 --> 22:31.077
- These woods are lovely, dark and deep.

22:32.483 --> 22:34.972
- And miles before. (grunts)

22:35.022 --> 22:37.522
(tense music)

22:40.264 --> 22:41.734
- It's over, you're caught.

22:41.784 --> 22:42.813
It's over!

22:42.863 --> 22:44.563
You know the crank caller,

22:44.613 --> 22:45.953
the one jerkin' off over the phone

22:46.003 --> 22:47.723
and blind-calling in girls.

22:47.773 --> 22:50.523
- Oh, yeah, yeah. (laughs)

22:50.573 --> 22:52.451
Where were you on the night of April 13th?

22:52.501 --> 22:55.584
- I told you, I was in bed, sleeping.

22:56.452 --> 22:57.971
- Right, and somebody
can corroborate this?

22:58.021 --> 23:00.022
-  Yes.

23:00.072 --> 23:02.155
- You killed John Gaines.

23:03.053 --> 23:05.202
We have three key witnesses

23:05.252 --> 23:07.702
who saw you rob that liquor store,

23:07.752 --> 23:09.690
and kill this guy in cold-blooded murder

23:09.740 --> 23:11.443
when it all went wrong.

23:11.493 --> 23:13.193
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't you.

23:13.243 --> 23:16.163
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't you.

23:16.213 --> 23:17.713
You piece of shit.

23:19.312 --> 23:21.222
(tense music)

23:21.272 --> 23:25.105
(suspect gasping and gagging)

23:32.449 --> 23:34.102
- Poor girl.

23:34.152 --> 23:37.793
Coroner thinks it may have only
taken her two hours to die.

23:37.843 --> 23:39.664
With all the markings on her throat,

23:39.714 --> 23:42.843
there were at least a dozen
attempts to strangle her.

23:42.893 --> 23:46.905
My guess is two hours
for it to all go down.

23:46.955 --> 23:49.363
- This is a terrible situation.

23:49.413 --> 23:50.196
- It is.

23:50.246 --> 23:52.913
(pensive music)

24:06.731 --> 24:10.070
(woman panting)

24:10.120 --> 24:10.903
- Not yet.

24:10.953 --> 24:12.582
(both panting)

24:12.632 --> 24:13.433
Not yet.

24:13.483 --> 24:16.066
(both panting)

24:45.893 --> 24:47.476
You're quiet today.

24:52.856 --> 24:54.689
I'm leaving this town.

24:58.735 --> 25:00.318
Next week, in fact.

25:01.837 --> 25:03.686
No, I did not find religion,

25:03.736 --> 25:06.403
but I'm just turning a new leaf.

25:09.346 --> 25:12.917
I'm moving back up to my mom's in Oregon.

25:12.967 --> 25:16.134
I'm going to start a jewelry business.

25:17.968 --> 25:20.718
Oh, no need to be so heartbroken.

25:24.048 --> 25:26.465
There is a very special girl,

25:27.938 --> 25:32.188
very special, and she will
take my place, you know?

25:35.863 --> 25:39.235
It's not like I'm leaving forever.

25:39.285 --> 25:40.614
It's just a thousand miles away.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.331
I'll come visit you.

25:45.424 --> 25:50.091
I have a four p.m. client, I
think you should leave now.

25:52.856 --> 25:55.189
-  Dahlia, day 289.

25:56.476 --> 25:59.059
Without you, it's not the same.

26:01.788 --> 26:03.985
I've begun writing again.

26:04.035 --> 26:06.138
Well, not actually writing.

26:06.188 --> 26:08.007
I've been keeping a journal,

26:08.057 --> 26:12.640
but it's a journal based on
my recollections and dates.

26:14.348 --> 26:18.807
For example, and I know
I have the date wrong,

26:18.857 --> 26:22.309
but do you remember the
time you slapped me?

26:22.359 --> 26:23.858
I have it written down in my journal

26:23.908 --> 26:26.075
as occurring on June 16th.

26:27.725 --> 26:31.321
You'll need to correct me
if I'm wrong about this,

26:31.371 --> 26:33.154
but I remember distinctly that the 15th

26:33.204 --> 26:35.402
was a Sunday that year,

26:35.452 --> 26:38.881
and Monday's paper, I went
to fetch that morning,

26:38.931 --> 26:42.201
and then you slapped me that evening.

26:42.251 --> 26:45.834
It didn't hurt, but I
was stunned for sure.

26:46.961 --> 26:50.690
I'd never seen you as physical
as you were that night.

26:50.740 --> 26:54.550
The force of your hand, there
could have been nothing more.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.767
(pensive jazzy music)

27:32.384 --> 27:36.432

29:41.406 --> 29:43.476
what it is that's troubling you,

29:43.526 --> 29:44.754
and how we can get to the bottom

29:44.804 --> 29:46.226
where the root of what's causing

29:46.276 --> 29:49.193
this imbalance you're experiencing.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.568
- So, there's this girl,

29:57.618 --> 29:59.957
this incredible girl.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.424
- How old is she?

30:04.578 --> 30:05.828
- 21, maybe 25.

30:11.196 --> 30:15.688
She seems to know how to play
older when she needs to be.

30:15.738 --> 30:18.208
- You mentioned she was murdered.

30:18.258 --> 30:21.341
But isn't murder part of our DNA now?

30:23.316 --> 30:24.973
We've discussed all of this yesterday,

30:25.023 --> 30:27.356
we've been over all of this.

30:29.463 --> 30:32.130
Anything else you wanna tell me?

30:43.494 --> 30:46.161
(pensive music)

30:52.140 --> 30:53.005
-  For one brief moment,

30:53.055 --> 30:55.124
no matter how much we fought,

30:55.174 --> 30:57.185
no matter how much we hated each other--

30:57.235 --> 30:59.718
- (breathing heavily) Yes!

30:59.768 --> 31:00.998
Yes!

31:01.048 --> 31:03.288
(Robert gasping)
Yes!

31:03.338 --> 31:05.027
Pass out, baby.

31:05.077 --> 31:09.608
-  No matter how much
we wanted to kill each other.

31:09.658 --> 31:11.907
-  Motherfucker, you!

31:11.957 --> 31:16.187
You motherfucker!
(loud slapping)

31:16.237 --> 31:19.067
-  The one brief moment,

31:19.117 --> 31:21.587
that one moment when hate turned to love,

31:21.637 --> 31:24.470
it was fleeting, but it was there.

31:25.538 --> 31:28.871
- So, I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right?

31:30.498 --> 31:33.581
(Stephanie grunting)

31:34.537 --> 31:38.496
You're not seriously thinking
about going back out there

31:38.546 --> 31:41.376
and finding that whole
lolita crowd again, are you?

31:41.426 --> 31:46.426
Because you cannot, Robert,
not anymore, it's dangerous.

31:46.517 --> 31:48.218
Oh, my God, you are!

31:48.268 --> 31:50.147
You're contemplating
jeopardizing everything

31:50.197 --> 31:52.425
and going back out there, aren't you?

31:52.475 --> 31:53.958
You can't, do you understand me?

31:54.008 --> 31:55.617
Like, no fucking way can't.

31:55.667 --> 31:58.584
- Stephanie, I must do--
- You must.

32:01.177 --> 32:02.094
You psycho.

32:03.320 --> 32:04.630
(Robert coughing and gasping)

32:04.680 --> 32:05.513
Yes, yes.

32:06.479 --> 32:09.638
(Robert gagging)

32:09.688 --> 32:11.110
Pass out.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.607
(pensive music)

32:13.657 --> 32:15.997
Yes! (panting)

32:16.047 --> 32:19.214
(tense pensive music)

32:32.349 --> 32:35.182
(Robert coughing)

32:52.769 --> 32:55.769
(Stephanie gasping)

33:01.541 --> 33:04.374
What was the first thing you felt?

33:06.010 --> 33:07.057
-  The room became darker,

33:07.107 --> 33:09.659
like watching the lights go down

33:09.709 --> 33:12.209
as the theater program begins.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.331
-  And do you
remember when you blacked out?

33:16.381 --> 33:18.659
-  No, it was
like a switch turned off.

33:18.709 --> 33:20.459
No, more like a fade.

33:21.551 --> 33:22.952
It just dimmed out.

33:23.002 --> 33:26.228
-  What do you
remember when you woke?

33:26.278 --> 33:29.078
-  I remember
this intense euphoria.

33:29.128 --> 33:30.909
-  You got it, baby.

33:30.959 --> 33:34.379
No one ever experiences
that the first time.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.598
I'm so impressed you got to that level.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.798
The mind needs to be there

33:39.848 --> 33:42.515
to bring us to full realization.

33:44.738 --> 33:46.321
-  Day 335.

33:48.498 --> 33:50.081
Dahlia, I need you.

33:53.253 --> 33:56.253
Nothing seems to make sense anymore.

33:57.271 --> 34:00.345
I wake up and don't want to wake up

34:00.395 --> 34:02.478
unless you're next to me.

34:03.563 --> 34:07.581
The coffee I make in the
morning isn't even the same.

34:07.631 --> 34:10.972
I can't smell you as I
shower in the morning.

34:11.022 --> 34:13.692
Time just seems to pass by in its own

34:13.742 --> 34:18.325
fleeting butterfly-ous way,
and I can't catch on to it.

34:19.790 --> 34:23.623
I can't grasp it in any
way that's meaningful.

34:26.308 --> 34:29.620
And I've been making the wrong choices.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.510
I can't stand what I've become.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.810
(bright pensive music)

34:45.439 --> 34:47.867
Timothy, I know you still
get a thrill out of this all,

34:47.917 --> 34:50.501
but I'm gonna call it quits soon.

34:50.551 --> 34:52.301
- You will, for what?

34:54.370 --> 34:56.850
After being nice guys for so many years?

34:56.900 --> 34:59.149
We busted our asses all these years,

34:59.199 --> 35:00.560
did everything above the board,

35:00.610 --> 35:02.240
only so those fucks could get promotions

35:02.290 --> 35:04.707
for the cases that we solved.

35:09.610 --> 35:12.589
I have no regrets in
what we're doing, Robert.

35:12.639 --> 35:14.970
- Well, it's just enough for me.

35:15.020 --> 35:17.901
If there ever was a thrill,
there isn't one anymore.

35:17.951 --> 35:21.118
(tense pensive music)

35:22.271 --> 35:25.141
- What are you gonna do,
go after your winery then?

35:25.191 --> 35:26.541
Assuming they give you
a good enough pension

35:26.591 --> 35:28.821
if you stick it out long enough.

35:28.871 --> 35:30.701
-  What if I became
the good guy for once?

35:30.751 --> 35:33.060
- (laughs) Good luck, pal.

35:33.110 --> 35:35.109
Can't change a horse's stripes.

35:35.159 --> 35:36.069
- They're zebras.

35:36.119 --> 35:37.420
- Same difference.

35:37.470 --> 35:40.229
The zebra is a horse,
or whatever they say.

35:40.279 --> 35:43.859
We're in too deep, buddy, and you know it.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.821
You have to play this out.

35:46.871 --> 35:48.547
-  You.

35:48.597 --> 35:52.010
- Okay, we if that makes
you feel any better.

35:52.060 --> 35:54.940
Stakes are high, you just
gotta roll with it, baby.

35:54.990 --> 35:58.157
(tense pensive music)

35:59.908 --> 36:01.869
-  So I think I found her.

36:01.919 --> 36:03.509
-  Oh?

36:03.559 --> 36:04.608
-  I was at the coffee place

36:04.658 --> 36:07.075
ordering my usual black chai,

36:08.009 --> 36:09.592
and then I saw her.

36:11.896 --> 36:15.338
Same eyes as your girl,
same facial structures.

36:15.388 --> 36:18.246
It's crazy, the resemblance, uncanny.

36:18.296 --> 36:19.600
Her face was like porcelain,

36:19.650 --> 36:22.818
like those antique porcelain dolls.

36:22.868 --> 36:26.868
Her eyes dark, deep blue,
just like your girl's.

36:28.858 --> 36:31.278
-  So what did you do.

36:31.328 --> 36:33.938
-  I was literally
frozen, I couldn't move.

36:33.988 --> 36:35.218
I wanted to walk up to her,

36:35.268 --> 36:38.935
but I just couldn't
believe the resemblance.

36:40.258 --> 36:41.091
We spoke.

36:42.168 --> 36:45.338
She admitted she made some
wrong choices early on,

36:45.388 --> 36:48.549
and was just looking to get
back on track with her life.

36:48.599 --> 36:50.698
She's broke, as you might have guessed.

36:50.748 --> 36:54.069
That's where you come
in, if you wanna do this.

36:54.119 --> 36:55.560
-  Okay.

36:55.610 --> 36:56.610
- I saw you.

36:58.569 --> 37:01.606
And, well, you were alone, so.

37:01.656 --> 37:04.168
I was alone too, and well,
I was hoping to talk to you

37:04.218 --> 37:06.800
because I was alone too.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.309
I just said that, didn't I?

37:08.359 --> 37:10.405
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

37:10.455 --> 37:14.363
- You could really
benefit from my sessions.

37:14.413 --> 37:16.013
Here.

37:16.063 --> 37:16.896
Call me.

37:18.143 --> 37:19.925
Are you hesitating?

37:19.975 --> 37:22.544
She said she's done this
type of thing before.

37:22.594 --> 37:23.563
-  You're sure?

37:23.613 --> 37:25.195
-  Baby, look me in the eye.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.333
Tell me you don't trust me after all

37:27.383 --> 37:29.194
that we've been through.

37:29.244 --> 37:34.244
I don't think you're going to
believe what you see, baby.

37:34.251 --> 37:36.433
It's almost like she came
to us from another world

37:36.483 --> 37:38.509
or something because
they knew we wanted her,

37:38.559 --> 37:42.738
like some cosmic gift. (laughs)

37:42.788 --> 37:45.209
Oh, we sound like sci-fi nuts now.

37:45.259 --> 37:47.018
Well, at least I do.

37:47.068 --> 37:47.901
Anyway.

37:49.399 --> 37:53.440
-  I don't know what
I'm doing anymore, Stephanie.

37:53.490 --> 37:55.930
-  Robert, it's
too late for this now.

37:55.980 --> 37:57.696
From the moment you
stepped into my office,

37:57.746 --> 37:59.749
I knew that we'd get to this level, baby.

37:59.799 --> 38:03.137
We said every step of the
way, no matter how hard

38:03.187 --> 38:05.480
or how fucked up it was going to be,

38:05.530 --> 38:09.056
we said we could and would just move on.

38:09.106 --> 38:10.269
Am I right?

38:10.319 --> 38:12.280
Do you remember this at all?

38:12.330 --> 38:14.656
Or do you only remember the fucking?

38:14.706 --> 38:16.930
There's no regrets, understand?

38:16.980 --> 38:19.230
Do you understand me, baby?

38:20.106 --> 38:22.298
Baby, are you there?

38:22.348 --> 38:23.898
-  Yes.

38:23.948 --> 38:24.997
-  If you like her,

38:25.047 --> 38:29.290
then she must come to
Stanton's teachings next week.

38:29.340 --> 38:31.656
Oh, give her 500 bucks, please.

38:31.706 --> 38:33.329
She needs rent money.

38:33.379 --> 38:35.949
-  Where's she staying?

38:35.999 --> 38:38.290
-  Do you really wanna know?

38:38.340 --> 38:39.480
-  I guess not.

38:39.530 --> 38:42.697
(tense pensive music)

38:43.580 --> 38:46.330
(Robert gasping)

39:06.492 --> 39:08.783
- A lot of what you experience in life

39:08.833 --> 39:12.732
is completely related
and directly inherent

39:12.782 --> 39:17.131
to these preconceived notions
that we have about our lives.

39:17.181 --> 39:18.859
how to live it.

39:18.909 --> 39:21.338
How much of it do you live?

39:21.388 --> 39:24.940
How much are you willing
to live and not hold back

39:24.990 --> 39:29.490
and accept the energy of all
of these incoming forces?

39:30.659 --> 39:33.498
Therefore, we like to stress

39:33.548 --> 39:37.040
that this will be a highly individual

39:37.090 --> 39:39.450
and personal experience for you,

39:39.500 --> 39:43.268
'cause it takes time, it
takes years of living life,

39:43.318 --> 39:46.428
perhaps, to be in full balance,

39:46.478 --> 39:50.215
to experience the ultimate,
the right mindset,

39:50.265 --> 39:53.098
the right body, touch your nerves.

39:56.258 --> 39:57.175
Touch them.

39:59.339 --> 40:00.839
We're all circuit.

40:02.238 --> 40:03.758
Feel it!

40:03.808 --> 40:05.849
Feel yourselves.

40:05.899 --> 40:07.399
Feel the physical.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.901
Feel the emotional.

40:11.299 --> 40:13.537
But what is emotion?

40:13.587 --> 40:18.097
Because what we think, it's
psychological, isn't it?

40:18.147 --> 40:20.657
And this psychological force, this energy,

40:20.707 --> 40:22.207
these cosmic lines

40:24.518 --> 40:26.435
combine and are created

40:28.768 --> 40:30.518
by a physical entity,

40:32.595 --> 40:33.428
a brain,

40:34.927 --> 40:36.260
a goddamn brain!

40:38.981 --> 40:42.148
(audience applauding)

40:49.592 --> 40:51.113
- We are late.

40:51.163 --> 40:52.163
- I'm sorry.

40:53.123 --> 40:57.790
- We are already conscious
above what they already know.

40:58.894 --> 41:03.394
And we strive to go to places
with our physical bodies

41:04.538 --> 41:06.728
where are physical bodies cannot go,

41:06.778 --> 41:10.195
unless we are one, one with the universe.

41:12.626 --> 41:14.209
Love is the answer.

41:17.506 --> 41:19.339
Love is one continuous

41:23.604 --> 41:24.771
endless dream.

41:27.004 --> 41:28.671
Everyone needs love.

41:33.095 --> 41:36.262
Movement number one, raise your hands.

41:38.687 --> 41:39.604
Raise them.

41:40.676 --> 41:41.509
Higher.

41:43.236 --> 41:44.069
Higher.

41:46.367 --> 41:47.266
Higher still.

41:47.316 --> 41:49.983
(pensive music)

41:55.138 --> 41:55.971
Higher.

41:56.876 --> 41:58.488
Higher.

41:58.538 --> 41:59.957
Reach for the sky.

42:00.007 --> 42:03.055
(tense pensive music)

42:03.105 --> 42:04.772
Movement number two.

42:08.236 --> 42:10.736
- I don't think I can do this.

42:11.836 --> 42:13.586
- The mind blocks us,

42:14.858 --> 42:18.927
but there will always
be a metaphysical path.

42:18.977 --> 42:20.227
The mind knows.

42:22.737 --> 42:27.136
Our perceptions of reality
are based upon what we see

42:27.186 --> 42:28.603
and what we read.

42:30.927 --> 42:32.927
But what about feelings?

42:34.578 --> 42:36.245
Feelings is truthful

42:37.796 --> 42:41.879
and do not let them dictate
to you what you feel.

42:44.050 --> 42:44.883
Four!

42:47.319 --> 42:49.498
Feelings are your own experience,

42:49.548 --> 42:53.917
and you take with it
whatever is inside of you.

42:53.967 --> 42:54.800
4.5!

42:58.366 --> 43:01.917
All these molecules that are
trying to insert themselves

43:01.967 --> 43:04.884
into you and bang you all to hell--

43:06.008 --> 43:08.167
- I know I know can do it.

43:08.217 --> 43:09.050
- Five!

43:10.016 --> 43:10.849
- Please!

43:11.788 --> 43:15.288
- I ask you, you have the right afterwards

43:17.839 --> 43:19.220
to morph with that.

43:19.270 --> 43:22.661
(Stephanie panting)
(tense pensive music)

43:22.711 --> 43:23.544
Six!

43:25.890 --> 43:27.120
- I can! (grunting)

43:27.170 --> 43:28.440
(woman coughing)

43:28.490 --> 43:29.290
(woman gasping)

43:29.340 --> 43:33.370
- Reject that cosmic sperm if you choose,

43:33.420 --> 43:35.170
and be whatever it is

43:38.020 --> 43:39.177
you want to be.

43:39.227 --> 43:42.394
(tense pensive music)

43:44.428 --> 43:46.845
(warm music)

43:53.695 --> 43:57.365
-  The moment she
picked up the vial, she knew.

43:57.415 --> 43:59.885
The crystals melted into her hand

43:59.935 --> 44:02.736
as if they had existed for centuries.

44:02.786 --> 44:05.907
A single salt crystal, a grain harvested

44:05.957 --> 44:08.397
as far as the beginning of time,

years ago at my school.

47:20.355 --> 47:23.585
(laughs) And screw those mothers.

47:23.635 --> 47:25.065
But my school changed their lunch menu

47:25.115 --> 47:27.204
for all the popular
people, like James Steven

47:27.254 --> 47:28.401
and Linda Kendall.

47:28.451 --> 47:30.714
- They changed the lunch
menu 'cause of popular kids?

47:30.764 --> 47:32.445
- Yeah, you can change a lunch menu.

47:32.495 --> 47:35.184
Well, for the elite few, you know,

47:35.234 --> 47:37.674
the real ones in the know,

47:37.724 --> 47:41.565
we were able to special
order in the morning.

47:41.615 --> 47:42.584
You know, like tell the
teacher in the morning

47:42.634 --> 47:44.685
you didn't want what
everyone else was having,

47:44.735 --> 47:46.864
like the penis dogs.

47:46.914 --> 47:48.143
- What's a penis dog?

47:48.193 --> 47:50.943
- You know, it's like a corn dog,

47:52.524 --> 47:54.034
breaded corn dog?

47:54.084 --> 47:54.984
- What's a breaded corn dog?

47:55.034 --> 47:56.744
- Yeah, it's like the
penis is in the middle

47:56.794 --> 47:59.925
and the breading's the condom! (laughs)

47:59.975 --> 48:04.975
Well, anyway, when it came
time for us to go to our lunch,

48:05.055 --> 48:08.221
well, we lesbies went
off to the annex portion

48:08.271 --> 48:10.274
of the building where
we'd eat our sub sandwich

48:10.324 --> 48:11.403
and chicken salad.

48:11.453 --> 48:13.674
But hear me out here.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.674
So, since only a handful of
us were sent to the annex

48:16.724 --> 48:18.645
to have lunch while the rest of those

48:18.695 --> 48:21.704
Mr. and Mrs. Populars went
off to main cafeteria,

48:21.754 --> 48:24.504
we on the other side were queens.

48:29.392 --> 48:31.725
I remember that V, Veronica,

48:34.312 --> 48:36.933
always tasted like chapstick,

48:36.983 --> 48:39.816
but she had the most amazing lips.

48:42.014 --> 48:46.014
It always matched room
temperature, as I recall.

48:47.114 --> 48:49.864
Meanwhile, Haley was a cold fish.

48:52.615 --> 48:54.282
We had good lunches.

48:55.655 --> 48:59.405
Kinda wish I was back in school again.

48:59.455 --> 49:03.788
Least I had a place to go
to every day at 12:30 p.m.

49:05.524 --> 49:08.607
I don't even know where to go to now.

49:10.284 --> 49:11.784
Mom's such a mess.

50:37.104 --> 50:40.104
(distorted singing)

50:52.001 --> 50:55.751
- On the street that I
live, well, years ago,

50:56.722 --> 50:57.543
there was this ice cream truck

50:57.593 --> 50:59.403
that used to come by our house.

50:59.453 --> 51:02.143
And you could hear the chimes, the melody,

51:02.193 --> 51:04.276
it goes so far, far away.

51:05.192 --> 51:06.664
I remember that feeling, you know,

51:06.714 --> 51:08.992
like the anticipation
of what it all meant.

51:09.042 --> 51:09.843
Before I knew it, my brother and I

51:09.893 --> 51:11.912
were at the front of the truck,

51:11.962 --> 51:14.740
'cause it arrived at our house.

51:14.790 --> 51:16.792
Sometimes it came by too quickly though,

51:16.842 --> 51:20.952
and the satisfaction wasn't quite there.

51:21.002 --> 51:22.272
Like, you know when you were
wanting something so bad

51:22.322 --> 51:24.614
that the build-up is
the best thing about it,

51:24.664 --> 51:27.982
and the actual feeling
in the end isn't as much?

51:28.032 --> 51:29.782
You know what I mean?

51:31.784 --> 51:36.363
Like, it wasn't the orgasm you
thought you were building up.

51:36.413 --> 51:38.246
Like it was a letdown.

51:41.851 --> 51:43.268
I wish I could...

51:46.520 --> 51:48.853
I wish I could just shut up.

51:49.693 --> 51:52.860
(tense pensive music)

52:42.817 --> 52:46.484
(man growling and groaning)

53:10.697 --> 53:13.197
(tense music)

53:17.766 --> 53:20.516
(Robert panting)

53:50.489 --> 53:52.674
- Say it, whore, say it!

53:52.724 --> 53:55.224
Get motherfuckin' whore money!

53:56.404 --> 54:00.244
I earned every goddamned dollar
of my fuckin' life honestly!

54:00.294 --> 54:02.570
Never in my life, never think
my daughter would be a whore,

54:02.620 --> 54:04.640
a cock-suckin' (mumbles) whore!

54:04.690 --> 54:06.652
Whore, say it, say it!

54:06.702 --> 54:08.369
Motherfuckin' whore!

54:09.681 --> 54:11.159
Never in my life!

54:11.209 --> 54:13.271
Daughter does this to me!

54:13.321 --> 54:15.087
Never in my life would I think

54:15.137 --> 54:16.409
my daughter would be a whore.

54:16.459 --> 54:18.999
Cock-sucking, common, drinkin' whore!

54:19.049 --> 54:22.216
(tense pensive music)

54:57.427 --> 55:00.344
(knocking on door)

55:32.229 --> 55:34.229
- It didn't really hurt.

55:36.613 --> 55:40.451
I don't know if it's
that I'm just used to it,

55:40.501 --> 55:42.418
or that I got stronger,

55:44.573 --> 55:45.573
or tolerant,

55:49.501 --> 55:50.334
or numb.

55:53.255 --> 55:54.338
I still feel,

55:58.165 --> 55:59.582
I feel you still.

56:01.625 --> 56:03.042
Know what I mean?

56:05.975 --> 56:08.058
It's like that guy on TV,

56:09.874 --> 56:13.435
that Indian guy that
says you can conquer all,

56:13.485 --> 56:16.216
your pain, your everything that hurts you,

56:16.266 --> 56:19.384
ails you, bothers you, and
with one push on your head

56:19.434 --> 56:23.601
with his hand, you are
cured and you feel nothing.

56:26.354 --> 56:29.937
(mysterious pensive music)

56:34.535 --> 56:36.202
Give me a countdown.

56:37.554 --> 56:38.387
- What?

56:40.845 --> 56:42.678
- Give me a countdown.

56:44.685 --> 56:47.835
You know, like 10, nine, eight.

56:47.885 --> 56:50.375
- Okay, 10, nine, eight.

56:50.425 --> 56:51.258
- No.

56:53.706 --> 56:54.706
Not so fast.

56:57.354 --> 56:58.805
Do it slow, please.

56:58.855 --> 57:02.438
(mysterious pensive music)

57:08.628 --> 57:09.506
- 10,

57:09.556 --> 57:13.139
(mysterious pensive music)

57:17.043 --> 57:17.876
nine,

57:20.783 --> 57:21.616
eight,

57:25.321 --> 57:26.154
seven,

57:29.841 --> 57:30.674
six,

57:35.127 --> 57:35.960
five,

57:40.519 --> 57:41.352
four,

57:47.856 --> 57:48.639
three.

57:48.689 --> 57:52.272
(mysterious pensive music)

57:55.306 --> 57:56.723
- Say it, please.

57:58.706 --> 57:59.539
T-t-t-two.

58:03.425 --> 58:04.258
- Two.

58:07.586 --> 58:08.419
- Say it!

58:09.284 --> 58:12.867
- (breathing heavily) One.

58:14.034 --> 58:19.034
(Jeanie gagging and gasping)
(mysterious pensive music)

58:21.722 --> 58:25.389
(Brandon breathing heavily)

58:32.003 --> 58:33.344
-  What he wanted to say then,

58:33.394 --> 58:34.853
he clearly couldn't say.

58:34.903 --> 58:36.666
He couldn't even form the
words that would describe

58:36.716 --> 58:39.455
what would become an incredible hatred.

58:39.505 --> 58:41.394
Not a hatred directly against her,

58:41.444 --> 58:44.346
but for whoever made her
become what she became.

58:44.396 --> 58:47.874
He called these the
horrible, the awful elements,

58:47.924 --> 58:49.885
the ones that would ruin everything.

58:49.935 --> 58:52.335
But the forces who could
take anything that was good,

58:52.385 --> 58:55.274
anything that ever meant
anything meaningful and good,

58:55.324 --> 58:57.965
good he kept seeing, and
then just ruin it all,

58:58.015 --> 58:59.615
just ruin the happiness,

58:59.665 --> 59:01.782
and that's all whatever the
forces that he had reckoned

59:01.832 --> 59:02.615
and struggled with.

59:02.665 --> 59:05.003
These were the ones ruining his happiness,

59:05.053 --> 59:06.974
and so the rest had to go.

59:07.024 --> 59:08.702
But he was very humble.

59:08.752 --> 59:10.832
He never stole anyone's happiness.

59:10.882 --> 59:13.462
He was only selfish to a point.

59:13.512 --> 59:14.982
But he said "thank you" whenever he felt

59:15.032 --> 59:18.662
he had received the correct
service at a diner, for example.

59:18.712 --> 59:21.100
And even though he didn't
really show his appreciation

59:21.150 --> 59:25.282
to any man or god, he felt the reverence.

59:25.332 --> 59:27.219
(Jeanie coughing)

59:27.269 --> 59:29.647
Time seemed to stand still for Brandon

59:29.697 --> 59:33.499
and operated at a slow crawl, increments,

59:33.549 --> 59:35.299
decibels, micro ions.

59:37.368 --> 59:40.059
He didn't know what it all meant.

59:40.109 --> 59:43.478
For Jeanie, it was the start of a life.

59:43.528 --> 59:47.316
And for Brandon, while
it had the joy of a life,

59:47.366 --> 59:50.048
the beauty, while it
all stood still for him

59:50.098 --> 59:54.190
whenever he was with Jeanie, it just ended

59:54.240 --> 59:55.878
when she came to his world,

59:55.928 --> 59:57.950
because she hadn't come from there.

59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.099
She was a gift, as
Stephanie had told Robert,

1:00:01.149 --> 1:00:04.118
but the gift was actually
meant for Brandon.

1:00:04.168 --> 1:00:07.808
He'd waited all his life for
someone who would look at him,

1:00:07.858 --> 1:00:10.508
just acknowledge his existence.

1:00:10.558 --> 1:00:13.107
He never knew when the
person he was next to

1:00:13.157 --> 1:00:15.258
knew if he was even there.

1:00:15.308 --> 1:00:18.309
He just wanted to know he was there,

1:00:18.359 --> 1:00:20.738
and Jeanie told him he was there.

1:00:20.788 --> 1:00:22.558
(Jeanie grunts)

1:00:22.608 --> 1:00:24.738
(mellow jazzy music)

1:00:24.788 --> 1:00:27.807
(telephone ringing)

1:00:27.857 --> 1:00:30.578
-  Hi, it's me, leave a message.

1:00:30.628 --> 1:00:31.461
- Day 301.

1:00:34.519 --> 1:00:35.879
It's a big number, isn't it?

1:00:35.929 --> 1:00:39.439
(mellow jazzy music)

1:00:39.489 --> 1:00:42.477
I thought about the
first time we went out,

1:00:42.527 --> 1:00:45.994
and me being crazy when I was back then,

1:00:46.044 --> 1:00:48.794
I asked you out for a midnight date,

1:00:48.844 --> 1:00:52.305
and you accepted, to my surprise.

1:00:52.355 --> 1:00:54.594
Do you remember that?

1:00:54.644 --> 1:00:56.674
No, you looked so beautiful.

1:00:56.724 --> 1:00:59.757
You didn't say a single word,
but I knew it in your eyes.

1:00:59.807 --> 1:01:02.457
You really believed in me.

1:01:02.507 --> 1:01:04.257
I could see the love.

1:01:05.596 --> 1:01:07.013
I saw your smile.

1:01:09.938 --> 1:01:13.021
It was late and you had no makeup on,

1:01:14.276 --> 1:01:15.443
and I saw you.

1:01:17.588 --> 1:01:21.255
You, that's what I
remember of you the most.

1:01:22.287 --> 1:01:25.704
I just don't want to lose those memories.

1:01:27.599 --> 1:01:31.708
Now I don't even know if
you have them anymore.

1:01:31.758 --> 1:01:32.758
Was I there?

1:01:35.239 --> 1:01:39.780
I don't even know if it
was, but I know I saw you.

1:01:39.830 --> 1:01:43.549
You existed and you were there for me.

1:01:43.599 --> 1:01:47.614
And I, I was a (phone beeps)...

1:01:47.664 --> 1:01:50.664
(dial tone droning)

1:01:53.625 --> 1:01:56.542
(soft tense music)

1:01:57.985 --> 1:02:00.984
-  For Brandon, it was easy.

1:02:01.034 --> 1:02:04.194
He knew who did it, who corrupted Jeanie.

1:02:04.244 --> 1:02:07.074
This elite group, they
controlled everything,

1:02:07.124 --> 1:02:10.714
the media, banks, state
parks, commercial real estate,

1:02:10.764 --> 1:02:12.714
ecology, the environment, technology,

1:02:12.764 --> 1:02:14.855
and everything that he had ever missed.

1:02:14.905 --> 1:02:17.954
It wasn't even intuition,
because Brandon knew.

1:02:18.004 --> 1:02:20.332
He had felt this woman,
the woman who had destroyed

1:02:20.382 --> 1:02:23.394
every feeling he had
ever felt in his life,

1:02:23.444 --> 1:02:26.271
a woman so selfish, so
absorbed, so charmed

1:02:26.321 --> 1:02:28.973
with the immediacy of
being accepted by anyone,

1:02:29.023 --> 1:02:31.351
even the homeless, wig-less, thief scumbag

1:02:31.401 --> 1:02:33.179
taking a shit on the curb.

1:02:33.229 --> 1:02:36.691
His acceptance meant everything to her.

1:02:36.741 --> 1:02:39.882
It was obvious the way
Stephanie had corrupted Jeanie.

1:02:39.932 --> 1:02:42.265
She had done it so expertly.

1:02:44.111 --> 1:02:48.128
- So today, we're gonna start
with the basic principles

1:02:48.178 --> 1:02:50.461
of what we're trying to achieve.

1:02:50.511 --> 1:02:53.250
And by that, I mean we're
going to try to blend

1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:56.169
the metaphysical with the physical,

1:02:56.219 --> 1:03:00.386
and that way, we can get
to that level of euphoria

1:03:01.372 --> 1:03:04.351
that's so important for mental health.

1:03:04.401 --> 1:03:05.184
- Cool.
- So we're gonna begin

1:03:05.234 --> 1:03:07.250
with the basics.
- Okay.

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:09.883
- Just sit up straight with me.

1:03:10.900 --> 1:03:15.233
And we're gonna start by
facing our thumbs together.

1:03:16.509 --> 1:03:21.040
Beautiful, and now you're just
gonna wrap around your neck,

1:03:21.090 --> 1:03:24.340
and just, I like to kinda ease into it.

1:03:26.658 --> 1:03:27.491
Beautiful.

1:03:28.618 --> 1:03:32.539
And now we're gonna find
that beautiful sweet spot.

1:03:32.589 --> 1:03:33.659
You got it.

1:03:33.709 --> 1:03:36.959
(dreamy pensive music)

1:03:43.061 --> 1:03:45.222
-  Why again, Steph?

1:03:45.272 --> 1:03:48.880
Haven't you learned by now it's
not about being insatiable?

1:03:48.930 --> 1:03:52.010
You want too much, and
now you're using others

1:03:52.060 --> 1:03:53.340
to do it for you.

1:03:53.390 --> 1:03:55.789
Don't sacrifice this girl, please.

1:03:55.839 --> 1:03:58.479
She's young, she's innocent.

1:03:58.529 --> 1:04:01.469
Just let her live her life for once.

1:04:01.519 --> 1:04:05.799
Let her find love,
disappointment, let her live.

1:04:05.849 --> 1:04:07.941
Will you give her a chance?

1:04:07.991 --> 1:04:11.469
I see her eyes, her eyes
show that she has a chance,

1:04:11.519 --> 1:04:13.349
unlike the others.

1:04:13.399 --> 1:04:15.189
-  How do you feel?

1:04:15.239 --> 1:04:16.570
- Good.

1:04:16.620 --> 1:04:19.577
(Stephanie panting)

1:04:19.627 --> 1:04:22.258
- There you go, perfect.

1:04:22.308 --> 1:04:23.130
Yes.

1:04:23.180 --> 1:04:24.440
(Stephanie and Jeanie panting)

1:04:24.490 --> 1:04:25.400
A little more.

1:04:25.450 --> 1:04:27.227
(Stephanie and Jeanie panting)

1:04:27.277 --> 1:04:28.360
Oh, yes, yes!

1:04:31.380 --> 1:04:32.469
Yes!

1:04:32.519 --> 1:04:33.848
There you go.

1:04:33.898 --> 1:04:35.090
There you go.

1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:36.858
(Stephanie and Jeanie panting)

1:04:36.908 --> 1:04:37.741
Yes.

1:04:38.828 --> 1:04:39.911

(wind blowing)

1:05:52.876 --> 1:05:57.043
- So, who did you say
recommended me to you again?

1:06:01.236 --> 1:06:02.069
- Jeanie.

1:06:03.615 --> 1:06:05.346
- Right, Jeanie.

1:06:05.396 --> 1:06:08.826
I saw you after hours
because of her referral.

1:06:08.876 --> 1:06:10.959
I don't normally do that.

1:06:14.175 --> 1:06:18.092
Brandon, I can only help
you if you talk to me.

1:06:20.415 --> 1:06:22.154
Why did you contact me?

1:06:22.204 --> 1:06:25.621
What is troubling you that was so urgent?

1:06:30.415 --> 1:06:31.582
How is Jeanie?

1:06:37.142 --> 1:06:40.002
Is there something you want
to tell me about Jeanie?

1:06:40.052 --> 1:06:42.067
Are you in a relationship with her?

1:06:42.117 --> 1:06:45.284
(tense pensive music)

1:06:49.917 --> 1:06:52.288
- Like a little sister.

1:06:52.338 --> 1:06:55.306
- She's like a little sister.

1:06:55.356 --> 1:06:57.515
That's all she is to you, a little sister?

1:06:57.565 --> 1:07:00.732
(tense pensive music)

1:07:04.066 --> 1:07:08.733
You seem to be upset about
something relating to Jeanie.

1:07:10.557 --> 1:07:12.057
- I lost somebody.

1:07:14.176 --> 1:07:17.118
- Did something happen
to Jeanie because of you?

1:07:17.168 --> 1:07:18.335
- No, no, I'm.

1:07:21.026 --> 1:07:23.484
- I can't hear you, what did you say?

1:07:23.534 --> 1:07:27.366
Brandon, you have to talk
to me for me to help you.

1:07:27.416 --> 1:07:29.999
Did something happen to Jeanie?

1:07:31.386 --> 1:07:35.536
We've already gone over the hour allotted,

1:07:35.586 --> 1:07:37.076
and I don't think I'm helping you

1:07:37.126 --> 1:07:40.293
because you're not telling me anything

1:07:42.415 --> 1:07:44.407
to give me a chance to help you.

1:07:44.457 --> 1:07:47.624
(tense pensive music)

1:07:50.379 --> 1:07:52.061
Brandon, I don't think I can help you.

1:07:52.111 --> 1:07:54.130
I think you need to call
a different therapist.

1:07:54.180 --> 1:07:55.610
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1:07:55.660 --> 1:07:56.762
- No.

1:07:56.812 --> 1:07:57.595
- It's getting late.

1:07:57.645 --> 1:07:58.951
- Sit the fuck down!

1:07:59.001 --> 1:08:02.168
(tense pensive music)

1:08:05.260 --> 1:08:08.529
- There's no need to get upset.

1:08:08.579 --> 1:08:09.980
You can tell me what's bothering you.

1:08:10.030 --> 1:08:13.221
That's what I do, that's
what I can do for you.

1:08:13.271 --> 1:08:15.770
I can help you get through this,

1:08:15.820 --> 1:08:17.640
but you have to talk to me.

1:08:17.690 --> 1:08:20.607
(Brandon laughing)

1:08:21.810 --> 1:08:23.290
All right, now this is starting to make me

1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:26.149
feel a little uncomfortable.

1:08:26.199 --> 1:08:27.501
I have to go.

1:08:27.551 --> 1:08:28.639
I really mean it--
- Sit down.

1:08:28.689 --> 1:08:30.661
- It's time to go, I
really want you to go.

1:08:30.711 --> 1:08:33.101
- Sit the fuck down!

1:08:33.151 --> 1:08:35.850
You sit and stay the fuck right there!

1:08:35.900 --> 1:08:38.410
- All right, I'm staying.

1:08:38.460 --> 1:08:41.210
- Okay. (laughs)

1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:45.478
- But I want you to leave.

1:08:45.528 --> 1:08:46.981
I want you to get the help you need,

1:08:47.031 --> 1:08:48.669
and I don't think I can do that.

1:08:48.719 --> 1:08:49.650
- No, start.

1:08:49.700 --> 1:08:51.088
- Please leave.

1:08:51.138 --> 1:08:51.921
(Stephanie screams)

1:08:51.971 --> 1:08:55.221
(dramatic tense music)

1:09:38.729 --> 1:09:41.312
- No! (crying)

(Stephanie crying)

1:11:09.988 --> 1:11:12.571
-  Where is she now?

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:15.410
-  You know.

1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:17.710
-  I'm so sorry.

1:11:19.255 --> 1:11:20.755
You did it nicely?

1:11:23.185 --> 1:11:24.435
-  No.
