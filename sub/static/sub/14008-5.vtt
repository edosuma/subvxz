00:01.865 --> 00:02.906
Pviously on Damages...

00:02.907 --> 00:04.650
I heard you were looking for me.

00:04.651 --> 00:05.353
Josh.

00:05.354 --> 00:07.154
Can we talk somewhere safe?

00:07.155 --> 00:09.581
I'd like you to sit in on
the Louis Tobin interview.

00:09.649 --> 00:11.549
I will find the money, Mr. Tobin.

00:11.603 --> 00:13.951
Tell me where it is and
I'll leave your family alone.

00:14.019 --> 00:15.532
There is no fortune.

00:15.533 --> 00:16.587
I want the money.

00:16.588 --> 00:17.506
Good.

00:17.507 --> 00:19.806
They're going to sentence
your father this week,

00:19.874 --> 00:22.108
sending him straight to prison
for the rest of his life.

00:22.176 --> 00:24.925
When the time comes, he's going to
contact us about the money, right?

00:24.992 --> 00:25.674
Right.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.389
What's Danielle Marchetti's prognosis?

00:27.390 --> 00:29.831
She's out of the operating
room and in recovery.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.087
Joe wanted her on that
plane to protect his father.

00:32.155 --> 00:35.089
What makes you think Danielle Marchetti
had anything to do with the fraud?

00:35.156 --> 00:39.845
Louis Tobin called her the night
he confessed to the Ponzi scheme.

00:39.912 --> 00:41.590
I'm ready, Karl.

00:41.591 --> 00:42.633
You want my advice?

00:42.634 --> 00:45.694
Let her take the lead because
whatever the Tobins are hiding,

00:45.762 --> 00:48.090
Patty will find it.

00:51.926 --> 00:56.163
Tom, I'm running a little late, so
don't have the staff meeting without me.

01:09.661 --> 01:12.515
Happy birthday.

01:12.582 --> 01:14.595
It's not my birthday.

01:14.663 --> 01:18.622
Sure, it is.

01:18.690 --> 01:22.247
What's it doing here?

01:22.315 --> 01:27.545
I thought you wanted one.

01:27.612 --> 01:28.884
Did I?

01:28.885 --> 01:33.847
It's all you ever wanted.

01:33.914 --> 01:37.736
This is going to be
your best birthday ever.

01:54.190 --> 01:56.833
Careful.

01:56.901 --> 01:59.747
She's a big responsibility.

02:05.138 --> 02:07.146
I know.

02:07.214 --> 02:13.073
Are you sure it's what you want?

02:13.140 --> 02:17.927
Yes.

02:17.995 --> 02:24.490
Can I keep her?

02:24.558 --> 02:28.973
You're going to have
to wash your feet first.

03:21.443 --> 03:25.645
Somebody should say something.

03:29.782 --> 03:33.150
Daddy never judged.

03:33.218 --> 03:36.552
He treated everyone the same.

03:38.622 --> 03:40.589
When Lenny first started working

03:40.657 --> 03:41.923
for him... when Daddy brought you

03:41.924 --> 03:46.593
home for the first time.
I remember he said to me,

03:46.661 --> 03:48.928
"Lenny's family now."

03:48.996 --> 03:51.263
Just like that.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.835
Dad was too generous.

03:56.903 --> 04:01.872
All he ever tried to do was
to give people what they want.

04:01.939 --> 04:03.940
That's true.

04:04.007 --> 04:07.475
It was his flaw.

04:07.543 --> 04:14.747
He wasn't greedy and he wasn't evil.

04:14.815 --> 04:17.682
Those investors knew what he was

04:17.750 --> 04:20.752
doing... and it was exactly what

04:20.820 --> 04:25.722
they wanted him to do... but...

04:25.790 --> 04:29.825
he paid the price for them.

04:29.893 --> 04:32.127
They should be underground, not him.

04:32.195 --> 04:35.263
Carol, Carol.

04:35.331 --> 04:37.766
It's the truth.

04:44.339 --> 04:46.839
I miss you, Daddy.

04:46.907 --> 04:49.341
I love you.

04:52.844 --> 04:56.780
It's okay, sweetie.

05:10.992 --> 05:13.993
All this stuff's going up for auction?

05:14.061 --> 05:16.362
We're selling off everything
in Tobin's apartment.

05:16.429 --> 05:18.130
The proceeds go to the victims.

05:18.131 --> 05:21.199
Are you sure you guys don't want a muffin?

05:21.266 --> 05:23.267
Uh, no, I'm good.

05:23.334 --> 05:26.969
Uh, so talk to me about the M.E. report.

05:27.037 --> 05:30.138
You reallyelieve Louis Tobin's
death was a heart attack?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.740
Do you?

05:32.807 --> 05:35.309
Me?

05:35.377 --> 05:38.846
Hmm.

05:38.914 --> 05:40.180
Pretty convenient.

05:40.181 --> 05:43.216
Guy dies the night before he's going
to jail for the rest of his life.

05:43.284 --> 05:45.051
He robs his victims of
their moment of justice.

05:45.052 --> 05:47.519
All we got now are his wife and children.

05:47.587 --> 05:49.521
If you want to connect them to the fraud,

05:49.522 --> 05:51.455
you're going to have to
depose Danielle Marchetti.

05:51.523 --> 05:54.457
The doctors say Ms. Marchetti will be
released from the hospital tomorrow.

05:54.524 --> 05:58.426
In the spirit of cooperation,
why don't we talk to her together?

05:58.494 --> 06:02.563
Okay, but first, why don't you tell
me everything you've got on her?

06:02.631 --> 06:05.332
I already have.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.537
Well, Patty, you withheld
your knowledge that

06:08.538 --> 06:11.675
Louis Tobin called Ms.
Marchetti on Thanksgiving.

06:11.743 --> 06:14.912
Yes, and I was wrong and I apologize.

06:14.980 --> 06:18.649
So why don't we just start over?

06:18.716 --> 06:21.919
Why don't you lead the questioning?

06:25.989 --> 06:28.791
And we'll depose her together.

06:30.494 --> 06:34.828
Okay, fine, let's depose her together.

06:40.900 --> 06:46.638
Did my fatr tell you he
was going to kill himself?

06:46.705 --> 06:52.844
I just want to know the truth, Lenny.

06:52.912 --> 06:57.014
He did.

06:57.082 --> 07:02.051
He would have told you, but you didn't
come see him like he asked you to.

07:04.454 --> 07:09.959
He couldn't face spending the
rest of his life in prison.

07:10.027 --> 07:15.932
Did you know Dad was
going to leave this behind?

07:15.999 --> 07:19.736
What is it?

07:19.804 --> 07:24.805
It explains where the money
is and how to get it back.

07:24.872 --> 07:26.935
He left this for Patty Hewes?

07:27.003 --> 07:30.097
With a very nice letter.

07:30.165 --> 07:36.399
He says he's coming clean for
me, to free me of his legacy.

07:36.466 --> 07:40.802
I had no idea about any of this.

07:40.870 --> 07:43.872
Well, it's a fascinating read.

07:43.939 --> 07:46.374
Now I know why he was
trying to get Danielle

07:46.375 --> 07:48.809
out of the countr She
knows where the money is?

07:48.877 --> 07:52.679
No, but she knows enough.

07:52.747 --> 07:55.114
He says you don't know where it is either.

07:55.182 --> 07:57.366
He only told me that someone would

07:57.367 --> 07:59.551
contact me whent was safe to retrieve it.

07:59.619 --> 08:01.286
He didn't said who.

08:01.287 --> 08:04.689
There's a name in there a
few times... Stuart Zedeck.

08:04.756 --> 08:06.924
He helped Dad with the money somehow.

08:06.992 --> 08:07.658
Stuart Zedeck.

08:07.659 --> 08:09.426
Zedeck... do you know him?

08:09.427 --> 08:11.928
I don't know, your father
menoned him a couple times.

08:11.996 --> 08:13.896
I just assumed he was an investor.

08:13.931 --> 08:17.833
Well, he's more than that.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.201
I want to meet him.

08:19.202 --> 08:21.669
Okay, I'll see if I can set it up.

08:21.737 --> 08:24.071
No, set it up.

08:25.774 --> 08:29.142
Listen, will you set up a
meeting with Judge Reilly?

08:29.210 --> 08:30.643
Sure, what for?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.611
I don't believe Patty for a second.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.580
We have to talk to
Danielle before she does.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.647
Okay.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.817
You don't really want Gates to take the
lead in Danielle's deposition, do you?

08:39.885 --> 08:43.754
No, he'll only fumble any shot we
have of getting information from her.

08:43.822 --> 08:46.023
We have to get to Danielle before he does.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.090
Right.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.893
Oh, hey, it's your birthday
this weekend, right?

08:49.961 --> 08:50.960
What are you doing?

08:50.961 --> 08:52.729
I haven't though about it.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.931
Come on, you got to do something.

08:55.999 --> 09:01.002
Gates brought Ellen with him again.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.404
Why haven't you interviewed
any possible associates?

09:03.472 --> 09:06.106
I've been reading resumÃ©s.

09:06.174 --> 09:07.174
And?

09:07.175 --> 09:10.243
And there's only one
candidate who seems promising.

09:10.311 --> 09:11.644
Man or woman?

09:11.645 --> 09:12.645
Woman.

09:12.646 --> 09:17.515
Oh, Jesus, does every woman
go to law school these days?

09:17.583 --> 09:19.550
Her name is Alex Benjamin.

09:19.618 --> 09:23.154
Okay, bring her in.

09:28.492 --> 09:32.661
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:38.233 --> 09:40.234
Was it a homicide?

09:40.301 --> 09:43.736
We haven't been able to confirm that.

10:08.717 --> 10:09.717
Alex Benjamin?

10:09.718 --> 10:10.717
Welcome.

10:10.718 --> 10:11.385
Tom Shayes.

10:11.386 --> 10:13.186
Mr. Shayes, it's a pleasure.

10:13.187 --> 10:13.853
Right.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.754
Oh, uh, this way.

10:16.823 --> 10:19.524
It's best not to go into an
interview with Patty cold.

10:19.592 --> 10:21.960
Most likely she'll grill you on
precedents regarding our current

10:22.028 --> 10:25.596
case, but any topic is fair game...
constitutional law, torts, contracts.

10:25.664 --> 10:26.664
Not a problem.

10:26.665 --> 10:28.632
Good.

10:28.633 --> 10:28.765
Good.

10:28.766 --> 10:30.666
Patty's not looking to see
how you handle the facts.

10:30.701 --> 10:32.702
She's looking to see
how you handle yourself.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.603
Got it.

10:35.237 --> 10:36.771
No, you don't.

10:36.772 --> 10:39.807
Um, when it comes to
reading people, she's got

10:39.808 --> 10:42.842
the sharpest bullshit
meter you've ever seen.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.010
I understand.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.912
I think I can handle it.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.513
Good.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.514
All right, we'll set
up a meeting with Patty.

10:50.515 --> 10:51.781
Anytime, anyplace.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.182
You name it.

10:53.183 --> 10:56.587
Anytime?

10:56.655 --> 11:01.961
What if, uh, the meeting were to take
place during your sister's wedding?

11:02.029 --> 11:04.730
I'd miss the wedding.

11:09.735 --> 11:10.735
I'm sorry, ma'am.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.670
You're not allowed in
to see Ms. Marchetti.

11:12.738 --> 11:16.006
I'm the court appointed
trustee in the Tobin case.

11:16.007 --> 11:18.407
My office subpoenaed Ms. Marchetti.

11:18.408 --> 11:19.407
I'm sorry.

11:19.408 --> 11:20.408
I have my orders.

11:20.409 --> 11:22.844
Afternoon, Patty.

11:23.012 --> 11:25.012
Your access has been suspended.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.415
I thought we were going
to talk to her together.

11:27.416 --> 11:29.417
Then, what are you doing here without me?

11:29.418 --> 11:31.419
The judge has granted me sole access.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.420
On what grounds?

11:32.421 --> 11:34.421
You withheld evidence, Patty.

11:34.422 --> 11:37.991
Next time, don't keep information from me.

11:38.059 --> 11:40.728
Excuse me.

11:44.666 --> 11:48.868
I'm Curtis Gates, Investigative
Division, District Attorney's Office.

11:48.869 --> 11:50.136
What do you want?

11:50.137 --> 11:54.172
The night you were going to leave the
country, you left a message with our office.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.641
No, that was a mistake.

11:57.642 --> 12:00.911
We know you're scared, Danielle.

12:00.979 --> 12:05.948
We also know about your
relationship with Louis Tobin.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.983
But we're not interested
in prosecuting you.

12:08.984 --> 12:11.286
All we want is the family.

12:11.287 --> 12:14.154
We're prepared to offer you immunity.

12:14.155 --> 12:15.621
If I do what?

12:15.622 --> 12:20.257
Go on the record. Tell
us everything you know.

12:22.594 --> 12:26.597
Deal's off the table in 48 hours.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.334
Think about it, Danielle.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.837
You'll be out of the hospital soon.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.739
We can help you.

12:42.242 --> 12:45.277
Someone videoed Dad's
funeral and put it online.

12:45.278 --> 12:46.645
What?

12:46.646 --> 12:49.113
They show us standing at the grave site.

12:49.114 --> 12:54.784
I mean, they were there, just hiding in
the cemetery while we were burying him.

12:54.852 --> 12:56.085
It's disgusting.

12:56.086 --> 12:57.986
He's dead.

12:57.988 --> 12:59.788
They won't stop attacking him.

12:59.789 --> 13:04.893
Carol, calm down.

13:04.961 --> 13:08.464
Why are we here, Joe?

13:08.532 --> 13:13.003
Because you deserve to know the truth.

13:16.306 --> 13:19.740
Carol, the autopsy was wrong.

13:19.808 --> 13:22.976
He didn't die of a heart attack.

13:23.044 --> 13:26.011
What do you mean?

13:26.079 --> 13:29.581
The night he died, I
went to the apartment.

13:34.987 --> 13:39.724
I found that on the
coffee table near his body.

13:42.894 --> 13:45.195
What is this?

13:45.263 --> 13:48.031
I called Dr. Brandt.

13:48.099 --> 13:51.032
He made the mix for Dad.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.668
So it would be painless.

13:53.735 --> 13:55.069
No.

13:55.070 --> 13:56.737
Daddy would never do that.

13:56.738 --> 13:57.972
Honey.

13:57.973 --> 13:59.406
I'm sorry... he did.

13:59.407 --> 14:02.809
He did.

14:02.877 --> 14:07.179
He ended his own life.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.849
Listen.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.551
Listen.

14:16.222 --> 14:21.393
You... we have to stop
blaming everyone else.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.296
He did this to himself.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.031
Okay?

14:27.099 --> 14:30.668
Carol, he did it to himself.

14:37.007 --> 14:39.542
Is everything okay?

14:41.445 --> 14:44.781
There's no reason to be anxious.

14:46.884 --> 14:49.886
Have you ever done this before?

14:51.689 --> 14:55.024
Many times.

14:55.092 --> 14:59.529
Well, then, tell me what you like.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.735
I want you inside me.

15:11.875 --> 15:14.543
My father died.

15:16.546 --> 15:19.081
Oh.

15:19.148 --> 15:23.819
He wasn't my real father.

15:23.886 --> 15:28.355
He was closer than my real father.

15:28.423 --> 15:31.558
And he was a friend.

15:33.861 --> 15:36.628
I'm so sorry.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.634
Can I put my head in your lap?

15:43.635 --> 15:46.303
Yes.

16:05.675 --> 16:08.576
Morning.

16:08.644 --> 16:11.712
There's a guy waiting for
you in the conference room.

16:11.713 --> 16:13.981
Says he's a friend, knew you a while back.

16:13.982 --> 16:15.116
Friend of mine?

16:15.117 --> 16:18.017
That's what he said.

16:18.050 --> 16:20.546
Did he say his name was Wes?

16:20.547 --> 16:23.743
I'm not sure.

16:36.301 --> 16:37.601
Hi.

16:37.602 --> 16:39.036
Can I help you?

16:39.037 --> 16:41.005
Hey, Ellen.

16:41.072 --> 16:42.639
Hey.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.474
Josh Reston.

16:44.475 --> 16:46.241
Goodness.

16:46.242 --> 16:47.276
Long time.

16:47.277 --> 16:51.046
I, uh, think the last time we spoke, you
were down in West Virginia busting Big Coal.

16:51.047 --> 16:52.080
Yeah.

16:52.081 --> 16:54.348
What are you doing in New York?

16:54.349 --> 16:56.416
Well, I've only been here a couple weeks.

16:56.417 --> 16:57.617
I, uh, just got a job reporting

16:57.618 --> 17:00.319
crime at the Manhattan Observer.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.553
Congratulations.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.587
Sit, sit.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.588
Thanks.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.356
Uh, it's just a start.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.190
But, um...

17:07.191 --> 17:10.291
I remembered you from the UNR case.

17:10.292 --> 17:12.627
Well, what can I do for you?

17:12.628 --> 17:15.063
Well, uh, when I heard
that you were here at the

17:15.064 --> 17:18.532
D.A.'s office, I thought that...

17:18.601 --> 17:21.234
we could help each other out.

17:21.303 --> 17:23.404
You want tips on stories.

17:23.405 --> 17:26.107
Oh, I thought I'd ask.

17:26.108 --> 17:30.676
Uh, you know, I just read that, uh, Joe
Tobin got pulled over for a broken taillight.

17:30.711 --> 17:33.045
You want to know about the Tobin case.

17:33.046 --> 17:35.513
Well, I know it's a lot
to ask, uh, but what I'd

17:35.514 --> 17:38.214
really like is an anonymous
source at the D.A.'s office.

17:38.215 --> 17:40.049
You know, strictly confidential.

17:40.050 --> 17:45.386
And if I could ever help you,
it would be a two-way street.

17:48.089 --> 17:50.857
Interesting.

17:52.426 --> 17:53.425
I'll think about it.

17:53.426 --> 17:55.460
Yeah, well, no worries either way.

17:55.461 --> 17:59.763
Yeah, and I appreciate your time.

18:01.933 --> 18:04.867
It was nice seeing you.

18:04.935 --> 18:06.836
Yeah, you, too.

18:06.903 --> 18:10.438
Thanks for stopping by.

18:16.076 --> 18:17.976
Go over everything carefully.

18:18.044 --> 18:22.446
This will be your last
opportunity before auction.

18:40.693 --> 18:44.495
They're selling off everything.

18:46.130 --> 18:47.630
Happy Thanksgiving.

18:47.631 --> 18:49.798
I love you all.

18:49.866 --> 18:52.033
Cheers.

18:52.101 --> 18:55.936
You can take personal effects
of sentimental value only.

18:55.937 --> 19:00.439
Anything appraised over
$20 will go to auction.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.906
$20?

19:01.907 --> 19:03.841
That's right.

19:09.146 --> 19:11.046
Excuse me.

19:11.081 --> 19:13.279
These are Dad's teacups.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.280
I can't do this.

19:14.281 --> 19:16.282
It's okay, sweetheart.

19:16.283 --> 19:18.284
They're taking away
everything that's left of him.

19:18.285 --> 19:19.284
Carol.

19:19.285 --> 19:22.054
Mom, just let her go.

19:26.090 --> 19:29.422
I want all the pictures.

19:29.423 --> 19:35.293
Uh, we can get you the
photos, but not the frames.

19:35.361 --> 19:36.961
And I want these.

19:36.962 --> 19:37.962
I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:37.963 --> 19:42.064
- Those are priced for auction.
- You said anything personal or sentimental.

19:42.065 --> 19:44.499
These are my grandson's favorites.

19:44.500 --> 19:49.369
These are very personal to me.
Mrs. Tobin got those in Tanzania.

19:49.370 --> 19:51.937
Her charitable foundation
treated sick children.

19:51.938 --> 19:53.005
She can't have them.

19:53.006 --> 19:55.409
Jesus, just give them to her.

19:55.410 --> 19:58.648
No, there's nothing I can do.

19:58.649 --> 20:00.219
Okay, you know what?

20:00.220 --> 20:02.120
Here.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.927
Here's the money for them, okay?

20:07.298 --> 20:10.466
They go to the highest bidder.

20:14.037 --> 20:18.279
I will contest this.

20:33.088 --> 20:34.721
I just got a call.

20:34.722 --> 20:36.556
Mr. Zedeck will meet with us.

20:36.557 --> 20:39.192
Good.

20:57.559 --> 21:00.494
Hey.

21:00.561 --> 21:05.664
I just, uh... uh, wanted to
tell you that I... I love you.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.605
I can't believe it.

21:16.673 --> 21:19.607
Gates blocked you out?

21:19.675 --> 21:20.908
Can't you appeal to the judge?

21:20.909 --> 21:24.411
Judge Reilly owes his appointment to
the D.A., he'll never side with me.

21:24.412 --> 21:27.547
You getting anywhere
with Louis Tobin's will?

21:27.614 --> 21:30.615
Tobin left all his money
in trusts for his family...

21:30.616 --> 21:33.784
Marilyn, Joe, Carol, and the grandson.

21:33.785 --> 21:37.953
But, before the Ponzi scheme unraveled,
he had a different will drawn up.

21:37.954 --> 21:41.222
It has an additional trust in it.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.225
For whom?

21:43.293 --> 21:45.228
Danielle Marchetti?

21:45.296 --> 21:47.230
I don't think so.

21:47.297 --> 21:49.631
See, it's a blind trust,
administered by a guardian.

21:49.632 --> 21:54.102
Which often means that the
trust has been setup for a minor.

21:54.170 --> 21:57.338
Let's talk to Marilyn Tobin again.

21:59.540 --> 22:00.940
Christ, it's freezing!

22:00.941 --> 22:03.943
You sure this is the place?

22:05.812 --> 22:07.813
Come on.

22:17.154 --> 22:18.154
I'm Leonard Winstone.

22:18.155 --> 22:19.822
This is Joe Tobin.

22:19.823 --> 22:20.823
My condolences.

22:20.824 --> 22:22.757
Your father was a brilliant man.

22:22.825 --> 22:24.659
Thank you.

22:24.660 --> 22:26.827
So, uh, we appreciate you meeting with us.

22:26.828 --> 22:29.162
And we'd like to start
making transactions.

22:29.163 --> 22:31.497
I'm afraid that's not possible.

22:31.498 --> 22:32.498
What? Why not?

22:32.499 --> 22:35.534
Because Mr. Zedeck is no longer
comfortable with the arrangement.

22:35.535 --> 22:37.368
Wait a second, you're not Stuart Zedeck?

22:37.369 --> 22:39.636
I'm his associate.

22:39.704 --> 22:40.704
Okay, let's go.

22:40.705 --> 22:41.404
Come on.

22:41.405 --> 22:43.106
Well, what the hell does that mean?

22:43.107 --> 22:45.609
- He's...
- Zedeck's not comfortable with the arrangement?

22:45.610 --> 22:50.618
Well, he's concerned that the climate is
no longer safe for him to conduct business.

22:50.686 --> 22:52.019
It's our money, asshole.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.187
It belongs to my family.

22:53.188 --> 22:56.024
Your father agreed to
terms with Mr. Zedeck.

22:56.025 --> 22:58.693
Somebody in your family
breached those terms.

22:58.694 --> 22:59.861
Who? That's bullshit.

22:59.862 --> 23:00.861
Is it?

23:00.862 --> 23:05.031
Then how come the authorities
know about Danielle Marchetti?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.804
That's... it doesn't matter.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.838
She... she won't be a problem.

23:09.839 --> 23:11.873
Ms. Marchetti is already a problem.

23:11.874 --> 23:15.310
And as long as she remains
one, Mr. Zedeck is unable to

23:15.378 --> 23:19.080
administer any transaction on your behalf.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.147
Look...

23:20.148 --> 23:21.148
That's it.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.150
That's it.

23:28.356 --> 23:31.391
What do you want to do?

23:33.727 --> 23:36.262
I'll take care of Danielle.

23:36.263 --> 23:39.264
Princeton, Yale Law.

23:41.863 --> 23:44.863
Sterling recommendations.

23:46.865 --> 23:49.800
Is that all?

23:49.867 --> 23:50.867
Is what all?

23:50.868 --> 23:53.803
You're efficient and you're competent.

23:53.871 --> 23:55.538
And you're bored.

23:55.539 --> 24:01.208
What is the one thing that you would
never want me to know about you?

24:01.276 --> 24:05.211
When I was a 2L, I got
rejected by Law Review.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.346
Then I found out that my
faculty adviser who taught the

24:08.347 --> 24:11.015
Law Advocacy Workshop had blackballed me.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.349
And why was that?

24:12.350 --> 24:15.251
He said I was, and I quote, a "loudmouth."

24:15.252 --> 24:17.753
So I filed a sexual harassment
suit and got him fired.

24:17.754 --> 24:19.788
Did he actually harass you?

24:19.789 --> 24:20.789
No.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.957
But a bunch of other
girls said he was a perv.

24:22.958 --> 24:25.892
So, it's close enough, right?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.895
None of that happened.

24:28.963 --> 24:31.965
Not a word of it.

24:34.835 --> 24:37.770
I like you, Alex.

24:37.837 --> 24:40.505
I'll check out your
references and get back to you.

24:40.506 --> 24:41.506
Thank you, Ms.

24:41.507 --> 24:43.774
Hewes.

24:43.842 --> 24:47.778
Oh, and happy birthday, by the way.

24:47.845 --> 24:49.779
It's not my birthday.

24:49.846 --> 24:51.180
No?

24:51.181 --> 24:52.347
Isn't it this weekend?

24:52.348 --> 24:54.282
No.

24:54.350 --> 24:55.517
Sorry.

24:55.518 --> 24:57.886
I guess Wikipedia got that wrong.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.889
We'll be in touch.

25:08.463 --> 25:12.299
Gates subpoenaed me.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.967
I'm going to be deposed.

25:30.548 --> 25:34.618
It's all in there...
everything you have to say.

25:34.686 --> 25:37.787
You want me to lie under oath?

25:37.788 --> 25:39.422
I, I can go to jail for that.

25:39.423 --> 25:42.625
If they had enough to arrest us,
they would have done it already.

25:42.626 --> 25:46.729
We just have to stick
to the same story, right?

25:46.796 --> 25:49.898
I want an attorney to go in with me.

25:49.899 --> 25:54.703
No, go alone.

25:54.771 --> 25:57.905
It'll seem like you have
nothing to hide then.

25:57.907 --> 26:01.609
Okay?

26:01.677 --> 26:05.245
Hey.

26:05.312 --> 26:10.681
Everything you have in life,
you have because of my father.

26:10.749 --> 26:14.218
I know that.

26:14.285 --> 26:16.283
Well...

26:20.519 --> 26:27.857
He's gone now, and I can
take it all away from you.

26:27.924 --> 26:31.993
Do you understand me?

26:32.061 --> 26:34.095
Yes.

26:37.966 --> 26:41.835
So here's the story you tell the D.A.

26:41.836 --> 26:45.304
I suggest you stick with it...

26:45.372 --> 26:49.808
because if we go down,
I am taking you with us.

27:06.055 --> 27:09.056
So Patty suggested we meet?

27:09.057 --> 27:12.258
She thought you'd have
some valuable perspective.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.593
On what?

27:13.594 --> 27:15.027
The job, I guess.

27:15.028 --> 27:17.862
I thought the interview went
great, and then she called.

27:17.863 --> 27:19.897
And did she hire you?

27:19.898 --> 27:20.898
No, not yet.

27:20.899 --> 27:23.733
She said I should speak to you first.

27:23.734 --> 27:25.134
Really?

27:25.135 --> 27:28.303
Excellent bag, by the way.

27:28.304 --> 27:29.304
Oh.

27:29.305 --> 27:31.205
It's stunning.

27:31.273 --> 27:32.673
Thank you.

27:32.674 --> 27:35.942
Can I ask... did Patty fire you?

27:35.943 --> 27:37.977
Is that what she told you?

27:37.978 --> 27:40.516
No, I just... I thought...

27:40.517 --> 27:43.054
Why would anyone in their right
mind leave Hewes & Associates?

27:43.055 --> 27:46.858
Well, yeah, especially for
a job in the public sector.

27:48.193 --> 27:50.294
Patty didn't fire me.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.496
You quit?

27:52.564 --> 27:54.564
It's a funny thing.

27:54.632 --> 27:58.401
You know, a friend of mine
once warned me about ambition.

27:58.469 --> 28:04.306
He told me that maybe the world
needs people like Patty Hewes.

28:04.373 --> 28:08.276
But that doesn't mean that
you should go work for her.

28:08.344 --> 28:09.610
Why not?

28:09.611 --> 28:14.881
Because once you sign on, she'll own you.

28:19.953 --> 28:25.690
I think I'd like that.

28:25.758 --> 28:29.059
Yeah, well, I didn't.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.727
I wanted a life.

28:30.728 --> 28:33.363
And how's that going?

28:33.364 --> 28:35.597
It's going great.

28:35.665 --> 28:38.166
It's going really great.

28:49.009 --> 28:52.345
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

28:52.346 --> 28:57.882
I thought if we met, it should be here.

28:57.950 --> 29:02.286
I had to fight paparazzi
just to get through the gate.

29:02.353 --> 29:04.721
I'm sorry.

29:04.788 --> 29:06.022
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:06.023 --> 29:10.926
Truly I am.

29:10.994 --> 29:14.496
I heard that you wanted these.

29:21.402 --> 29:23.336
Thank you.

29:23.404 --> 29:26.038
You're welcome.

29:26.106 --> 29:31.576
I think my husband killed himself.

29:31.643 --> 29:33.777
Did you know that?

29:33.845 --> 29:37.914
No.

29:37.981 --> 29:40.382
I just wanted to bring you those.

29:40.383 --> 29:41.883
My condolences.

29:41.884 --> 29:45.886
I... I'm worried about my daughter.

29:45.954 --> 29:48.522
Uh, she's not handling this well.

29:48.523 --> 29:52.357
She's, um...

29:52.425 --> 29:53.525
It's got to stop.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.426
I beg you to leave us alone.

29:55.460 --> 30:01.665
I understand because I'm a mother, too, but I
have an obligation to your husband's victims.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.734
What can I do?

30:03.801 --> 30:07.137
W... what will make you leave us alone?

30:07.138 --> 30:11.842
Tell me the truth about
Danielle Marchetti.

30:11.910 --> 30:16.216
Why did Louis really
call her on Thanksgiving?

30:18.986 --> 30:22.888
You don't understand.

30:24.724 --> 30:27.459
Make me understand.

30:27.526 --> 30:34.331
You think my husband used
Danielle to hide money.

30:34.398 --> 30:39.435
His mistakes were much
more foolish than that.

30:39.503 --> 30:41.503
I left my pills.

30:41.571 --> 30:43.004
Please bring them over.

30:43.005 --> 30:44.039
I don't care.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.141
Leave them in the lobby.

30:47.209 --> 30:48.442
Just do it, Danielle.

30:48.443 --> 30:52.012
Goddamn it, just do it.

30:55.282 --> 30:58.284
Danielle Marchetti!

31:06.658 --> 31:14.731
So... you've been in
Louis' life all these years.

31:14.799 --> 31:18.401
Just give him the pills.

31:18.469 --> 31:24.273
Then you had the baby, didn't you?

31:24.341 --> 31:28.343
I loved him.

31:34.382 --> 31:39.852
Louis was supporting Danielle
because he had a child with her.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.454
Yes.

31:42.522 --> 31:45.189
Do you know where that child is now?

31:45.190 --> 31:46.457
I never asked.

31:46.458 --> 31:48.358
I...

31:48.761 --> 31:52.563
I have my own family to worry about.

31:52.631 --> 31:55.765
Mrs. Tobin, just... just one more thing.

31:55.766 --> 31:57.634
When we were tracking down the

31:57.635 --> 31:59.902
phone number you gave Joe, Louis

31:59.970 --> 32:05.273
tried to get Danielle out of the country.

32:05.341 --> 32:08.709
Because he knew his family.

32:08.777 --> 32:14.914
He knew Danielle Marchetti
could have torn us apart.

32:14.982 --> 32:17.984
It had nothing to do with money.

32:42.117 --> 32:45.018
I wasn't expecting that.

32:45.386 --> 32:48.254
Yeah. Me, neither.

32:48.321 --> 32:51.490
This is a...

32:51.558 --> 32:53.458
this is a nice place.

32:53.893 --> 32:55.460
You live alone?

32:55.461 --> 32:57.396
Yeah.

32:57.463 --> 33:00.765
I had a house down in West Virginia.

33:00.766 --> 33:04.401
But up here, I live in a shoe box.

33:04.502 --> 33:08.404
How do you afford a place like
this on a government salary?

33:08.472 --> 33:11.807
Well, I saved some money
from when I worked for Patty.

33:11.808 --> 33:13.876
Oh.

33:13.943 --> 33:15.043
Right.

33:15.044 --> 33:16.644
Why'd you quit there anyway?

33:16.645 --> 33:19.647
I mean, you guys were
handling Frobisher and UNR.

33:19.648 --> 33:20.681
It's...

33:20.682 --> 33:24.183
You were at the center
of the legal universe.

33:25.052 --> 33:26.052
Yeah.

33:26.053 --> 33:28.555
It's a long story.

33:28.622 --> 33:33.494
Is, uh... everything okay?

33:33.495 --> 33:34.728
Yeah. No, I'm good.

33:34.729 --> 33:35.729
I'm good.

33:35.730 --> 33:38.932
Uh, just, a... little restless.

33:39.000 --> 33:45.605
Well, if you want to get some
dinner, I don't have anywhere to be.

33:45.672 --> 33:46.772
Yeah.

33:46.773 --> 33:48.441
I feel like cooking.

33:48.442 --> 33:49.576
Baking, actually.

33:49.577 --> 33:51.711
Are you sure?

33:51.779 --> 33:52.779
Yeah.

33:52.780 --> 33:56.948
It's my new therapy.

33:57.016 --> 33:58.983
You like cupcakes?

34:04.756 --> 34:05.989
Hello?

34:05.990 --> 34:09.092
Ms. Marchetti, this is Patty Hewes.

34:09.092 --> 34:11.427
Do you know who I am?

34:11.494 --> 34:12.828
Yes.

34:12.829 --> 34:13.828
Good.

34:13.829 --> 34:15.362
Then listen carefully.

34:15.364 --> 34:18.231
I know you have an arrangement
with the Tobin family.

34:18.232 --> 34:20.233
That's not true.

34:20.301 --> 34:21.333
Don't lie to me.

34:21.335 --> 34:24.502
You'll only dig yourself in deeper.

34:26.039 --> 34:27.938
What do you want?

34:27.940 --> 34:31.141
Whatever story they want
you to feed to the D.A.'s

34:31.143 --> 34:35.780
office... for your own
good... don't do it.

34:35.847 --> 34:39.549
Gates has offered me immunity.

34:39.617 --> 34:43.686
You think immunity will
protect your daughter?

34:43.753 --> 34:45.487
Wait a minute.

34:45.487 --> 34:47.722
Who told you about my daughter?

34:47.790 --> 34:50.791
I will find the Tobin's
fortune, Ms. Marchetti,

34:50.859 --> 34:53.592
and when I do, they'll go to jail.

34:53.594 --> 34:58.630
You and your daughter will be left alone,
and I'll control who gets the money.

34:58.631 --> 35:04.600
Help me now, and I can provide for you.

35:04.668 --> 35:08.001
That's an offer Gates can't make.

35:08.002 --> 35:11.237
I can't tell the truth in
that deposition tomorrow.

35:11.238 --> 35:13.339
I don't want you to.

35:13.406 --> 35:14.740
What do you mean?

35:14.741 --> 35:19.041
It's your constitutional
right to say nothing.

35:19.042 --> 35:23.679
I just want you to sit
there and plead the Fifth.

35:23.747 --> 35:27.683
Do it...

35:27.750 --> 35:30.719
and I'll take care of you.

35:39.428 --> 35:42.795
Ms. Marchetti, just for
the record, you're aware

35:42.796 --> 35:46.531
that you're entitled to have an
attorney present, if you desire one?

35:46.532 --> 35:50.099
Yes, I'm aware.

35:50.167 --> 35:52.968
Okay, then, let's begin.

35:52.969 --> 35:57.804
Uh, Ms. Marchetti, do you recall
when you first met Louis Tobin?

36:03.175 --> 36:06.176
Ms. Marchetti?

36:10.316 --> 36:13.320
Do you understand the question?

36:16.860 --> 36:18.194
Yes, I understand.

36:18.195 --> 36:21.864
When did you first meet Louis Tobin?

36:24.600 --> 36:27.302
I invoke my right not to
answer, on the grounds I

36:27.303 --> 36:30.304
may incriminate myself.

36:34.008 --> 36:36.042
Ms. Marchetti, are you
aware what you're doing?

36:36.043 --> 36:40.112
I'm pleading the 5th.

36:46.418 --> 36:48.652
This came for you, Ms. Hewes.

36:48.653 --> 36:49.653
Thank you, Perry.

36:49.654 --> 36:51.655
Getting chilly out there.

36:51.656 --> 36:52.656
It sure is.

36:52.657 --> 36:55.692
Gonna be a long winter.

37:06.036 --> 37:10.905
I have to say, Carol, I
certainly didn't expect

37:10.973 --> 37:13.708
to see you knocking at my door.

37:13.776 --> 37:17.311
I appreciate you taking
the time to talk to me.

37:17.379 --> 37:21.882
I know what you're going
through is extremely difficult.

37:21.883 --> 37:24.951
It is.

37:25.018 --> 37:28.753
But I'm not exactly sure
what you want from from me.

37:28.754 --> 37:33.357
I know it's weird, but
you have a history with my

37:33.424 --> 37:38.193
family, and I'm the only one that
didn't really get to know you.

37:39.195 --> 37:42.797
Well, you were young.

37:42.798 --> 37:47.767
Back when you and Joe were together,
he never really brought you around.

37:47.835 --> 37:51.303
Your mother hated me.

37:51.371 --> 37:53.172
I think she may have

37:53.173 --> 37:56.742
blamed you for some of his shit.

37:56.810 --> 37:59.846
It seemed like things started

37:59.913 --> 38:03.782
going crazy for him once he met you.

38:03.849 --> 38:07.184
It wasn't like that.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.886
No?

38:08.887 --> 38:13.790
What was it like?

38:13.858 --> 38:18.395
Look, Carol, um...

38:18.462 --> 38:21.097
I wasn't a saint.

38:21.165 --> 38:25.334
But neither was Joe.

38:25.402 --> 38:31.339
My dad took care of you?

38:31.406 --> 38:35.709
Did you take care of him?

38:35.776 --> 38:37.410
It's complicated.

38:37.411 --> 38:43.283
We were just trying to make the
best of a difficult situation.

38:43.351 --> 38:48.087
Did you love him?

38:48.154 --> 38:53.859
Look, Carol, I am really
sorry for your family.

38:53.927 --> 38:57.228
I am.

38:57.296 --> 39:01.632
But I'm gonna get your coat.

39:39.923 --> 39:42.324
Are you going to hire Alex Benjamin?

39:42.325 --> 39:43.692
Who?

39:43.693 --> 39:46.061
The candidate you interviewed.

39:46.062 --> 39:47.562
Oh.

39:47.563 --> 39:49.331
I don't know.

39:49.332 --> 39:52.200
And what's next for Danielle?

39:52.201 --> 39:53.401
Go over there tonight.

39:53.402 --> 39:55.770
Just make sure that she's
still willing to talk to us.

39:55.771 --> 39:56.771
No problem.

39:56.772 --> 40:00.240
I want to talk to her about her daughter.

40:23.566 --> 40:25.466
Hi.

40:27.970 --> 40:30.938
I know your mother, Danielle.

40:31.005 --> 40:35.208
I thought it was time we met.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.781
Miss Marchetti?

40:46.818 --> 40:49.018
Miss Marchetti, your door was...

41:37.570 --> 41:38.567
Happy birthday.

41:38.568 --> 41:40.500
She's a big responsibility.

41:40.568 --> 41:42.569
It's all you ever wanted.
