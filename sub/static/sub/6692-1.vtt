I'll be there in about 10 minutes.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.729
Excuse me.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.560
- Sorry.
<i>- I know, girl.</i>

02:13.666 --> 02:17.329
Right? The party was amazing
at Jasmine's last night.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.928
Girl, everybody was there.

02:20.039 --> 02:23.566
<i>If you want to seal the deal with a guy,</i>
<i>you need a short skirt and sexy panties.</i>

02:23.676 --> 02:26.144
- Oh. Hold on.
- Uh, is Soloman here?

02:26.246 --> 02:27.873
Oh, he's in the back, baby.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.949
<i>Anyway-
Yeah, you wanna go out with us tonight?</i>

02:30.049 --> 02:33.883
<i>Mexicans traditionally have</i>
<i>supplied the world with tacos-</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:35.648
Horowitz!

02:35.755 --> 02:39.191
- Eight down?
- Oh. Uh, uh, that would be Bora-Bora.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.590
It's a tough one. Don't punish yourself.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.693
Please say yes. Please say yes.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.326
<i>- Please say yes.</i>
- Oh, hey, Mary.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.405
Hello, sir.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.667
Um, I have an idea.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.709
Do you have next week's crossword?

02:57.810 --> 03:00.176
Indeed I do, but better yet...

03:00.280 --> 03:02.942
I have many and a brilliant plan.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.609
Instead of doing just one crossword
per week, I could go daily.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.652
- I could do five per week-
- I'm sorry...

03:07.754 --> 03:10.188
but we just don't
have space for that kind of content.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.588
I know, but, sir, the crossword...

03:12.692 --> 03:15.661
is everyone's favorite
part of the newspaper.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.730
And we could be just like the
<i>New York Times...</i>

03:17.830 --> 03:19.957
where the puzzle gets
harder as the week goes.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.364
So on Monday,
a day that traditionally bites the big one-

03:22.468 --> 03:24.698
This isn't the <i>New York Times.</i>
We're a local paper.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.295
- Our readers just wanna have fun.
- Oh.

03:27.407 --> 03:30.934
Oh! Well, sir, if fun is what they want...

03:31.044 --> 03:33.205
then Mary Horowitz has their fun.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.247
Ta-da! For Saint Patty's Day.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.213
Top o' the morning to ya.

03:37.317 --> 03:37.678
Leprechaun.

03:37.679 --> 03:39.877
<i> Wonderful.</i>
<i>You guys are such a beautiful couple.</i>

03:42.522 --> 03:44.422
Congratulations, man.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.424
<i>I know. Who would have ever thought?</i>

03:46.526 --> 03:48.255
- Mary.
- Yes?

03:48.361 --> 03:51.262
Do you ever stop working
long enough to, you know, like, go out?

03:51.364 --> 03:53.264
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, spend time with friends?

03:53.366 --> 03:55.664
- Nope.
- Go on a date?

03:55.768 --> 03:59.295
Mm-mmm. Oh. Uh, well,
I have a- a date this evening, sir.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.737
- Oh?
- Yes. A-A blind one.

04:01.841 --> 04:05.470
My parents set it up. So I was
obviously going to cancel.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.102
Go on out on your date.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.579
You know, have some fun with him, and-

04:09.682 --> 04:11.650
Have you moved back into your apartment?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.652
Uh, no. Still fumigating.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.721
But I'm just waiting for
the chemicals to settle...

04:16.822 --> 04:19.291
so I don't get the- the old brain cancer.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.691
Though if I don't move out of my parents'
home soon, I'll be forced to get a lobotomy.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.627
So it's brain cancer,
lobotomy, brain cancer-

04:24.628 --> 04:24.786
Mary.

04:24.897 --> 04:28.924
Mary, less work, more of everything else.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.935
Just enjoy being normal.

04:32.372 --> 04:35.398
Martin, I need that feature
on the pumpkin shortage.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.476
Is it ready?

04:40.913 --> 04:44.212
Be normal.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.046
Normal.

04:46.152 --> 04:49.747
<i># Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey #</i>

04:49.856 --> 04:51.915
<i>In life, as in crosswords...</i>

04:52.025 --> 04:53.959
<i>some days are harder than others...</i>

04:54.060 --> 04:56.153
<i>and that's what keeps your brain alive.</i>

04:56.262 --> 04:58.730
<i>The key to surviving those tough days</i>
<i>is to pick yourself up...</i>

04:58.831 --> 05:01.493
<i>and stay focused on your life's purpose.</i>

05:01.601 --> 05:06.368
<i>For me, that's imparting the joy</i>
<i>of crosswording to all mankind.</i>

05:06.472 --> 05:08.531
<i>Ah, crosswording...</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:12.168
<i>the most spectacular fun</i>
<i>a person can have without passing out.</i>

05:12.278 --> 05:14.405
I like your protective ensemble.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.641
Bunker gear, if you will.

05:16.749 --> 05:20.241
So, if these kids set you on fire,
you're good to what- 300 degrees?

05:20.353 --> 05:22.253
If I survive this- Phew!

05:22.355 --> 05:24.823
I'm supposed to go on a blind date tonight.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.824
Yeah. Steve.

05:26.926 --> 05:30.726
Steve. Yeah.
His mother probably thinks he's gay.

05:30.830 --> 05:34.823
So, my parents are no doubt pimping me out
to test his sexuality. Thanks.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.732
<i>But I'm- I'm- I'm gonna cancel.</i>

05:37.837 --> 05:40.431
Yeah. I mean, wouldn't you?

05:40.540 --> 05:43.373
Yeah? Though I-I could use a little-

05:43.476 --> 05:45.376
if you know what I'm saying.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.345
Yeah. Been a long time.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.279
Mary Horowitz.

05:53.386 --> 05:56.116
Yes. Yes. That is-That's me.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.782
Here's a treat, students.

05:58.891 --> 06:03.624
Miss Mary Horowitz is the crossword
constructor for the <i>Sacramento Herald.</i>

06:03.730 --> 06:06.790
You know the crossword puzzles that you see
each week in the newspaper?

06:06.899 --> 06:09.595
Well, it's her job to create them.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.761
Isn't that fun?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.705
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

06:15.808 --> 06:19.801
people do crossword puzzles all the time...

06:19.912 --> 06:25.043
but they don't often think of the person
who made all the words fit together.

06:25.151 --> 06:30.214
<i>Crossword constructors have</i>
<i>above-average intelligence...</i>

06:30.323 --> 06:32.382
and it helps if they can spell.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.255
Okay. Um-

06:40.366 --> 06:41.993
Okay. That's good.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.396
Imagine, if you will, a world.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.237
- A world-
- Daniel. You have a question.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.504
You make a living doing that?

06:52.612 --> 06:54.512
Well-

06:54.614 --> 06:56.775
One puzzle a week
can't make you enough to live on.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.283
<i>How do you pay your rent?</i>

06:59.385 --> 07:01.376
Oh, uh-

07:01.487 --> 07:06.424
Well, my parents have graciously
permitted me to bunk at their abode...

07:06.526 --> 07:09.427
<i>- while my apartment is being fumigated.</i>
- You live with your parents?

07:09.529 --> 07:12.191
<i>Temporarily, yes, I live at home.</i>

07:13.733 --> 07:17.328
But, then again, so do all of you.
So there. Now-

07:17.437 --> 07:19.997
- You don't have a husband, do you?
- Or a boyfriend.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.370
Kids, come on.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.311
No. Not-Not at- Not at this time.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.150
Though I have had liaisons.

07:47.567 --> 07:51.628
<i># Soon Yi was a pilot in the nationally known #</i>

07:51.737 --> 07:55.639

<i># She didn't have no kids</i>
<i>She didn't have no time #</i>

<i># She was a woman of her word</i>
<i>She was a fighter of crime #</i>

08:02.648 --> 08:05.776
<i># She looked good in a hat</i>
<i>She had a natural way #</i>

08:05.885 --> 08:07.785
<i>- # With tools and no car#</i>
- Shoot.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.219
<i>- # She went to UCLA#</i>
- No, no, no, no, no.

08:17.597 --> 08:21.124
Hi. I often suffer from
benign positional vertigo.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.930
Do you mind not driving until I can get my-

08:24.036 --> 08:26.334
Okay. Okay. All right.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.839
Ow.

08:28.941 --> 08:32.741
<i># And I don't know why life #</i>

08:32.845 --> 08:36.212
<i># It seems to be #</i>

08:39.118 --> 08:44.351
<i># So hard for dreamers #</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:48.460
<i># Like you and me ##</i>

08:50.796 --> 08:53.594
Mary? How'd it go?

08:55.001 --> 08:56.901
Smashing success.

08:57.003 --> 09:00.769
Or as they say in old Paris,
<i>coup de maître,</i> meaning "masterstroke."

09:00.873 --> 09:03.259
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs
and, uh, get ready.</i>

09:03.260 --> 09:03.433
Good.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.704
Oh. So you're going ahead with the date?

09:11.651 --> 09:13.915
Yes. Of course.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.784
Look how excited I am. Better get going...

09:16.889 --> 09:20.052
if I'm gonna fall in love
and get proposed to...

09:20.159 --> 09:23.060
register at Barnes and "Normal"...

09:23.162 --> 09:25.653
<i>have a beautiful wedding</i>
<i>with an accordion band and little, tiny...</i>

09:25.765 --> 09:29.030
plastic bride and groom on top of a cake,
posing like this.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.770
I'm gonna go.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.205
<i>I just want her to be happy.</i>

09:36.309 --> 09:37.606
Yeah.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.871
Go out and have some fun.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.140
Mm-hmm.
You ever wanna see any grandchildren...

09:42.248 --> 09:44.443
you're gonna have to burn those damn boots.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.146
Carol, I have a date.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.452
A blind one.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.458
But...

09:54.560 --> 09:59.361
if this Steven is anything better than
excessively hideous...

09:59.465 --> 10:01.990
I think we really should
try and make it work.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.127
Because, if society wants me to be normal...

10:05.237 --> 10:08.104
then normal we shall be, right?

10:08.207 --> 10:10.175
Yes.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.734
Oh, and, Carol, I really would appreciate
your support on this too.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.440
And by "support," I don't mean that.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.018
<i>Mary?</i>

10:20.119 --> 10:22.087
Knock, knock, knock.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.521
Oh. Look at you.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.526
Already have- repeatedly.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.562
Mar. He's hot.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.894
Please don't mean on the inside.

10:36.168 --> 10:38.261
<i>- I'm a cameraman for CCN-</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm?</i>

10:38.371 --> 10:40.362
<i>- a news program.</i>
<i>- We don't really watch-</i>

10:40.473 --> 10:41.837
<i>Work with a guy
called Hartman Hughes.</i>

10:41.838 --> 10:43.408
<i>Ever seen him?</i>
<i>No. Can't say I have, but -</i>

11:03.329 --> 11:05.490
Hey, Mary. I'm Steve.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.750
Carol. Carol, I bring news.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.388
There's been a- There's been
a most unexpected turn of events.

11:39.498 --> 11:44.333
My date is substantially better
looking than one might have predicted.

11:44.437 --> 11:48.100
And you know what? Colin Powell once said,
"There's no secret to success."

11:48.207 --> 11:50.107
Well...

11:50.209 --> 11:54.111
clearly he doesn't understand the power
of spectacular skivvies.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.613
There she is!

12:01.754 --> 12:03.813
Oh, wow.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.755
Nice boots.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.727
Thank you.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.662
You ready?

12:13.766 --> 12:15.757
Mmm.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.768
- So nice to meet you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:17.870 --> 12:21.135
- Oh, yeah. It's raining outside.
- Hold this. The door.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.231
<i>- Let me get that door for you.</i>
- Thanks again.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.072
<i>- Good luck. Shalom.</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:32.616
I have to admit, at first I wasn't so sure
about this whole blind date thing...

12:32.718 --> 12:35.380
but now I'm surprised
our parents didn't set it up earlier...

12:35.488 --> 12:37.388
especially knowing my mother.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.583
Must be some kind of conspiracy.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.129
Oop. You good?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.569
Oh, he's so not gay.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.137
Oh, man, it's coming down.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.442
It's really coming down, huh?

13:03.549 --> 13:07.315
I thought maybe we could
go to, uh, Ernesto's.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.484
They've got great tamales.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.787
And they have this drink
called, uh, "El Gallo Negro."

13:14.894 --> 13:16.361
<i>It means "the black rooster."</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:18.862
You have, like, two of those drinks, it's like you-

13:18.964 --> 13:21.262
Oh. You okay? You okay?

13:25.905 --> 13:28.874
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.910
Wait, wait.
What-What about-What about your parents?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.912
- What about my parents?
- Your mom.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.710
Mmm. She's married,
and you're not her type. Mmm.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.048
No, I just mean-
I just mean we're right in front of home.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.088
Whoa. I just-

13:44.190 --> 13:46.784
I just mean we're right
in front of their house.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.192
And I have no problem with that whatsoever.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.824
Oh, Steven. Oh, Steven.

13:55.858 --> 13:59.701
Is that Steven with a "V"
or Stephen with a "P-H"?

13:59.805 --> 14:01.898
- It's with a "V."
- I thought so.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.271
- Yeah.
- Thought so. You know, There's over...

14:04.376 --> 14:06.401
a million Stevens with a-
a "V" in the country.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.345
It's much more popular than the "P-H" way.
Twice as popular, in fact.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.382
I think it was the Brits
who prefer their P-H's.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.334
Yeah. Not as much as their fish and chips.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.850
Steven, we really should
commend our mothers...

14:18.958 --> 14:20.979
for predicting our
all-encompassing compatibility.

14:20.980 --> 14:21.256
I got it.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.124
I mean, we're-we're both
professionally compatible...

14:24.230 --> 14:27.393
you in TV,
and- and me in, uh-you know, in newspapers.

14:27.499 --> 14:31.697
I'll help you. Also noticing we're both
quite sexually compatible.

14:31.804 --> 14:35.103
I don't know if you noticed like I noticed,
but we're both wearing blue...

14:35.207 --> 14:37.107
- and what are the chances of that?
- Ooh.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.676
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.870
Of course, the chances are probably pretty good-

14:40.980 --> 14:43.540
<i>given that blue is one of the most
popular of the three colors.</i>

14:43.649 --> 14:46.243
Do you, uh- Do you like crosswords?

14:46.352 --> 14:47.910
Sure I do.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.544
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.919
You know how when the perfect clue
gets stuck in your brain...

14:52.024 --> 14:56.620
and it just explodes
into this bouquet of mixed emotions?

14:56.729 --> 14:59.061
I'm- I'm aroused.
I'm intrigued. I'm a- I'm amused.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.497
- I'm perplexed. I'm- I'm just like all these things.
- Uh-huh.

15:02.601 --> 15:07.095
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Can- Let's go back to the, uh- the aroused.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.003
- Okay. Okay. Wow. Steven.
- Whoa.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.906
- Oh.
- It's like we're two rare Earth elements...

15:12.011 --> 15:13.945
just brought together by the Norns.

15:14.046 --> 15:18.676
- It's just-That's Scandinavian for the Destinies.
- Oh.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.693
And now I'm going to eat you
like a mountain lion.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.148
You know what? I'm sorry.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.815
- It's my phone.
- What are you doing?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.894
- I didn't hear it ring. That's odd.
- Vibrate. It vibrated.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.155
- I didn't feel it.
- Oh, probably because of all the grinding.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.856
- I'll get over here.
- Yeah?

15:35.968 --> 15:38.163
What? Yeah. What's up?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.795
- All right. I'm coming.
- Oh! Already?

15:40.906 --> 15:43.636
- Okay. Okay. I can hurry. I can hurry.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.369
I- I gotta go to work.

15:45.477 --> 15:48.605
<i>- There's breaking news.</i>
- Oh. Oh!

15:48.714 --> 15:51.547
- Gosh, I'm so sorry.
<i>- Well, it's-it's okay. It's-</i>

15:51.650 --> 15:55.484
I gotta go to, uh, Boston.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.817
Wow. Boston, huh?

15:57.923 --> 16:00.118
That's a spectacular city.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.352
Known not only for its- its tea...

16:02.461 --> 16:05.225
but, uh, for Sam Morse,
who invented the Morse code.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.299
- Get out of here.
<i>- Yes. Do you want some help?</i>

16:07.399 --> 16:10.698
No. You know, it's so- it'd be so much more
interesting staying here and everything.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.170
Like, I really wish you could be there.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.707
<i>- Life on the road sure is tough.</i>
- Oh. I- I-

16:16.809 --> 16:19.004
But you have a job to do.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.144
Oh. He likes Twinkies.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.679
Okay. It's been fun.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.561
- Okay. That's for you.
- Oh. <i>Gracias.</i>

16:37.663 --> 16:40.188
Yeah.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.671
Thank God.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.175
Okay. Big crazy person.

And I need to- I-This crossword is bullshit.

17:54.873 --> 17:58.036
Anyway, he said he was gonna change,
and I, for one, believe him, so-

17:58.143 --> 18:00.077
This doesn't make any sense.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.444
- Well, to me, it does.
- Oh. Yeah. Of course.

18:03.549 --> 18:06.040
- This is lame.
- Have you tried six down?

18:06.151 --> 18:09.814
<i>- These clues suck!</i>

18:12.458 --> 18:14.585
I can't get any of these!

18:15.694 --> 18:17.662
Oh, thanks.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.995
Don't even bother. I don't know what the deal
is, but it looks like every single clue is-

18:22.101 --> 18:24.092
"All About Steve"?

18:25.871 --> 18:29.272
One across: Steve's eye color.
Five across: Steve's car odor.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.832
Twenty across: Steve's lips taste like-

18:32.945 --> 18:35.175
Mint explosion.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.006
Mary, who's Steve?

18:38.117 --> 18:42.178
- Oh. An extraordinary-
- No, no. That's not what's important.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.688
What's important is what you've done
with this crossword puzzle. I mean, it's- it's-

18:45.791 --> 18:48.658
- It's inspired.
- No.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.489
- Romantic.
- No.

18:50.596 --> 18:54.498
Oh, you're a tough one today. Let's see. Um-

18:54.600 --> 18:56.500
It's unprofessional.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.196
Un- No.
That's not the word.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.671
Um, okay. Let me think. You are-

19:04.243 --> 19:06.211
Mmm.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.245
You've tarnished the paper's reputation.

19:08.347 --> 19:12.408
<i>I mean, I really thought that you would've known</i>
<i>better than to pull something like this.</i>

19:12.518 --> 19:16.318
Do you have any idea
how many readers you've let down?

19:16.421 --> 19:20.084
Uh, 7,402, but-

19:20.192 --> 19:22.217
- Mary.
- Yes?

19:26.098 --> 19:28.066
Mary, we're gonna have to let you go.

19:30.801 --> 19:34.100
Oh.

19:34.205 --> 19:37.038
<i>I could make it up to you...</i>

19:37.141 --> 19:39.769
by doing a fishing themed crossword.

19:39.877 --> 19:42.505
I know how you love the- the piscatology.

19:48.719 --> 19:51.017
I'm sorry.

19:53.658 --> 19:55.558
We can, um-

19:55.660 --> 19:57.560
Yeah, we'll just, uh-We'll-

19:57.662 --> 19:59.562
I'll call you, and we'll just-

20:04.869 --> 20:09.101
<i>Police tell us that the chief suspect in
the case is one Mr. Mark McLaglen.</i>

20:09.207 --> 20:11.402
Okay, guys. You're set.

20:11.509 --> 20:14.603
Tucson's affiliate's on site now.
Remote van's waiting for you at the airport.

20:14.712 --> 20:16.771
- Okay.
- But I get an Escalade, right?

20:18.149 --> 20:21.550
Dan, we talked about this.
Nick Vasquez gets an Escalade.

20:21.652 --> 20:25.452
- Nick Vasquez has six Emmys.
- Stolen from me.

20:25.556 --> 20:29.287
- He was robbed, Dan. All six times.
<i>- Thank you, Stevie.</i>

20:29.393 --> 20:32.191
I mean, he can't help it
if he's considerably older than Vasquez.

20:32.296 --> 20:36.596
By "older" he means
experienced, Marlboro Man handsome.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.760
Um, I'm pretty sure I meant old.

20:38.869 --> 20:43.101
<i>Wh-Wh-Wh-Whatever.</i>
<i>Which one of you geniuses can explain this?</i>

20:43.207 --> 20:45.573
...little feller just needs to stiffen up.

20:46.677 --> 20:48.577
<i>With the two purple flowers-</i>

20:48.679 --> 20:51.671
- I'd, uh, be happy to, Dan.
- Look at how the blue brings out my eyes.

20:51.782 --> 20:55.115
Yeah. What I was going for here was-
Oh, look at that smooth push-in.

20:55.219 --> 20:57.779
<i>Western motif,
sort of the iconic flower.</i>

20:57.888 --> 21:01.187
<i>Then I needed a backdrop,</i>
<i>like a mountainous range. Boom! Two mountains.</i>

21:01.292 --> 21:03.419
In Hollywood, they call that a Mae West,
'cause Mae West had-

21:03.527 --> 21:07.122
Keep talking, fellas. Keep talking your way
right back to the Weather Channel.

21:07.231 --> 21:09.665
Right back to 10 degrees in Buffalo...

21:09.767 --> 21:12.930
where you'll be spending most of your days
taking close-up shots of kids' snotsicles.

21:14.605 --> 21:16.903
Well, give us something good, Danny.

21:17.008 --> 21:20.068
- I mean- we're fighter pilots, man.
- Yeah, we really are.

21:20.177 --> 21:23.112
It's like sending an F-16
to kill your neighbor's dog.

21:23.214 --> 21:25.114
<i>It's a waste of our energy.</i>

21:25.216 --> 21:28.447
And I need one big report, man,
to get that anchor desk.

21:28.552 --> 21:30.543
Get out of my office.

21:30.655 --> 21:34.648
<i>This is a big report, so don't screw it up with</i>
<i>any more stupid pranks this time, Hartman.</i>

21:34.759 --> 21:37.159
And you, Angus,
you're responsible for these guys.

21:37.261 --> 21:39.923
Make sure they don't embarrass me in Tucson.
They screw around, you're out.

21:40.031 --> 21:40.528
Yes, sir.

21:40.529 --> 21:43.125
Remember the Escalade.

21:44.468 --> 21:46.368
- Starling, how you doing?
- Whatever.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.335
- Jackie, looking sweet. Paula.
- In your dreams.

21:48.439 --> 21:52.170
I can feel your love darts coming over this way.

21:52.276 --> 21:54.301
- Mom. I'm working. What's up?
- You're the man, Hartman Hughes.

21:54.412 --> 21:56.312
No, I haven't read it. Why?

21:56.414 --> 22:00.350
Uh, okay. Hey.
Does anybody have a <i>Sacramento Herald?</i>

22:00.451 --> 22:02.351
<i>- Yeah. Right here.</i>
- Right. Yeah, I got it.

22:02.453 --> 22:04.444
Yes, I ate lunch. What section?

22:07.491 --> 22:09.584
Oh, wow. This is all about me.

22:12.496 --> 22:15.590
Wait. This is all about me.

22:44.295 --> 22:46.195
Yes.

22:47.231 --> 22:50.496
Oh. Ow, ow, ow.

22:50.601 --> 22:53.764
Doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt.

22:53.871 --> 22:56.601
But obviously the gods have seen-

22:56.707 --> 22:59.005
Where are you?

22:59.110 --> 23:02.136
Ooh. Hi. There you are.
Okay. Do you know what's at work here?

23:02.246 --> 23:05.511
<i>Pistas. Indicios. Anhaltspunkte.</i>

23:05.616 --> 23:07.709
Clues.
They're just-They're-They're everywhere.

23:07.818 --> 23:10.651
One, I was thinking of not going on the date,
but then the good children...

23:10.755 --> 23:13.918
of, uh, Youngstrum Academy kindly-
You know, they-they persuaded me to go.

23:14.024 --> 23:16.492
Two, my date duly arrives.

23:16.594 --> 23:20.291
And lo, not only is he, uh, <i>muy caliente,</i>
but he likes my red boots.

23:21.499 --> 23:24.059
<i>Three, Steve says it would be great...</i>

23:24.168 --> 23:26.102
if I could be on the road with him.

23:26.203 --> 23:29.070
<i>But, of course,
I cannot because I have a job.</i>

23:29.173 --> 23:32.267
Four, only days later,
I learn I no longer have a job...

23:32.376 --> 23:37.336
which is obviously just the final clue
leading to the blindingly simple answer:

23:37.448 --> 23:40.178
Onward, Mary Horowitz.
Onward. Go be with Steve.

23:40.284 --> 23:42.946
What do you mean you don't have a job?

23:43.053 --> 23:46.318
Missing the point, Father. Uh, the clues
have been deciphered. I must journey forth.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.325
Journey forth where?

23:50.728 --> 23:52.787
Father, you're making me crazy.

23:55.533 --> 23:57.899
Ah. Voilà, Papa.

23:58.002 --> 24:01.199
If it is news, Steven is there.
Auf Wiedersehen.

24:01.305 --> 24:04.934
This is Hartman Hughes
reporting from the edge.

24:05.042 --> 24:07.067
Anybody seen Vasquez? Huh?

24:07.178 --> 24:09.078
- Anybody seen Vasquez?
- No.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.671
Too much of a pussy to come
to a dangerous hostage crisis.

24:11.782 --> 24:12.549
Thirty seconds.

24:12.550 --> 24:14.182
Just gonna bring
you around on the left.

24:14.285 --> 24:17.880
Well, I wanna open up on the dust,
then we're gonna hit a 45 up to your right side.

24:17.988 --> 24:21.685
All right. Steve, but I'm gonna indicate down
the street. I'm gonna come around the left.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.817
- And right here.
- Ten seconds-you're on with Paula.

24:23.928 --> 24:27.056
She still mad at you for giving
those Jenny Craig gift certificates?

24:27.164 --> 24:27.846
And five, four-

24:27.847 --> 24:30.531
Fact I was looking at her ass
to begin with is a compliment.

24:33.337 --> 24:37.103
Paula, I've just arrived
at Wild Willy's Old Western Town...

24:37.208 --> 24:39.870
beloved tourist attraction
in Tucson, Arizona.

24:39.977 --> 24:43.913
On a typical day,
this street would be busy...

24:44.014 --> 24:48.348
with families eager to enjoy
the Wild West life experience.

24:48.452 --> 24:52.081
Tragically, today,
the man who plays Wild Willy the Outlaw...

24:52.189 --> 24:54.714
has taken his role to heart...

24:54.825 --> 24:57.225
and captured eight of his coworkers,
taking them hostage...

24:57.328 --> 24:59.558
<i>and holding them in the saloon...</i>

24:59.663 --> 25:03.565
a mere 85 yards away from where I stand now.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.658
Shots have been fired, Paula!

25:05.769 --> 25:08.761
<i>- Let's go handheld, Steve!</i>

25:12.309 --> 25:15.608
<i>It's unclear at this moment</i>
<i>who the shot was intended for...</i>

25:15.713 --> 25:19.205
or how many lives have perhaps been lost.

25:19.316 --> 25:21.807
Okay. Breaking news, Paula.

25:21.919 --> 25:24.683
We have our first confirmed kill:

25:24.788 --> 25:26.756
a horse.

25:26.857 --> 25:32.193
<i>One of many that live here</i>
<i>at Wild Willy's Old Western Town.</i>

25:32.296 --> 25:35.129
First victim of this senseless tragedy.

25:37.401 --> 25:42.134
It's at moments like this I'd like to believe
that there's a heaven just for horses-

25:43.173 --> 25:45.073
rolling meadows, lush grasses...

25:45.175 --> 25:49.612
<i>the spirits of deceased horses</i>
<i>galloping to and fro.</i>

25:50.714 --> 25:52.773
Long may you roam...

25:54.051 --> 25:57.384
- in heaven, O noble horse.
<i>- </i>

25:58.923 --> 26:00.891
<i>Not dead.</i>

26:05.162 --> 26:08.620
And yet, the horse not quite dead, Paula.

26:08.732 --> 26:10.597
<i>Not quite dead at all.</i>

26:13.137 --> 26:16.664
He's apparently a trained horse, Paula.

26:16.774 --> 26:18.935
Trained to drop down-

26:19.043 --> 26:23.309
during Wild Willy's
Old West shoot-out routine.

26:23.414 --> 26:25.382
<i>This particular horse...</i>

26:25.482 --> 26:29.111
also sensitive to trucks
backfiring on Route 20.

26:29.219 --> 26:31.244
Well-

26:31.355 --> 26:35.291
in the midst of tragedy, a blessed miracle.

26:35.392 --> 26:35.581
Cut.

26:35.582 --> 26:38.691
<i>Damn it, Steve!
Do you think this is funny?</i>

26:38.796 --> 26:43.256
You guys could see the horse is alive, and you're
giving me the "bring 'em the tears" signal?

26:43.367 --> 26:45.267
No, no.
This is the "bring the tears" signal.

26:45.369 --> 26:47.360
This is
"Hey, the horse is up. It's galloping."

26:49.473 --> 26:50.940
Yeah.

26:51.108 --> 26:53.008
<i>You know my favorite answer?</i>

26:53.110 --> 26:55.078
<i>"Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis."</i>

26:55.179 --> 26:57.545
<i>It's a lung disease.
Ooh! Fontana, California.</i>

26:57.648 --> 27:00.014
Y-You know what they make there? No?

27:00.117 --> 27:02.017
No? They make-They make steel.

27:02.119 --> 27:04.952
Yeah. Do you know how they make it? No?

27:05.055 --> 27:08.183
I won't bore you with the whole story,
just the-just the best parts...

27:08.292 --> 27:12.023
like- like how it's made from, uh,
molten pig iron, which-

27:12.129 --> 27:16.361
which does not, as everyone might think,
have anything to do with pigs or swines or hogs.

27:16.467 --> 27:20.130
It's-It's a raw iron
made from iron and coke.

27:20.237 --> 27:23.331
<i>And by coke, I mean the, uh, carbonaceous
residue, not the-not the cola.</i>

27:23.440 --> 27:25.340
Or the booger sugar.

27:25.442 --> 27:28.843
<i>It's-It's a method perfected</i>
<i>by Sir Henry Bessemer, a Brit.</i>

27:28.946 --> 27:33.178
Oh. And Bessemer is also a town in Alabama.
Yea!

27:33.283 --> 27:35.683
<i>Yep. And you know what
they have there? No? No?</i>

27:35.786 --> 27:39.813
Hitler's typewriter.
Hitler's typewriter.

27:39.923 --> 27:42.221
That guy was such an asshole.

27:42.326 --> 27:45.102
<i>Anyone up for a potty break?</i>
<i>It's not good to hold it.</i>

27:46.330 --> 27:48.161
We're gonna take five minutes here.

27:50.768 --> 27:55.728
Establishments in desolate areas like this
are usually run by family members that are, uh-

27:58.375 --> 28:01.776
No! No! Stop!

28:03.781 --> 28:05.749
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

28:07.051 --> 28:09.679
Crap. Crap.

28:23.033 --> 28:26.025
<i># I want to hit the road #</i>

28:26.136 --> 28:29.663
Yes. Hi. Uh, Do you know when
the next bus to Tucson goes through here?

28:29.773 --> 28:32.298
'Cause I kind of just-just missed mine.

28:36.213 --> 28:39.046
I'm headed that way.

28:39.149 --> 28:41.049
Oh. That's nice.

28:43.854 --> 28:45.788
<i>So, you ever kill any animals?</i>

28:45.889 --> 28:49.586
<i>Set a trash can full of kittens on fire?</i>
<i>You know, something like that.</i>

28:49.693 --> 28:51.285
No.

28:51.395 --> 28:53.863
No? Okay.

28:53.964 --> 28:55.898
What about humans? That had to-

28:57.167 --> 28:59.260
Would I tell you if I did?

29:01.472 --> 29:04.066
Touché, sir. Touché.

29:04.174 --> 29:07.337
<i># Hit the road and drive for miles #</i>

29:08.712 --> 29:12.307
<i># I'm gonna hit the road</i>
<i>and I'm not gonna-#</i>

29:12.416 --> 29:14.714
<i>You can wait for that
next bus if you want.</i>

29:26.797 --> 29:28.765
Uh- Uh-

29:28.866 --> 29:33.997
Roughly 9.85.
I will give this to you and just-Thank you.

29:35.239 --> 29:37.173
Stop! Stop!

29:52.422 --> 29:55.084
May I see your license, please?

30:02.966 --> 30:04.866
Norman James Durwood?

30:05.969 --> 30:07.869
Mary Magdalene Horowitz. Nice to meet you.

30:07.971 --> 30:10.496
Good to meet you, I think.

30:10.607 --> 30:14.737
<i>Norm, if you are going
to rape and murder me...</i>

30:14.845 --> 30:17.678
you are going to have to cut my body up
into a million chunks...

30:17.781 --> 30:19.681
and scatter me all over four states...

30:19.783 --> 30:21.546
because this appendage...

30:21.652 --> 30:24.985
will lead homicide detectives right to you.

30:25.088 --> 30:27.716
And that would be <i>no bueno.</i>
I think we're good.

30:31.562 --> 30:35.191
My other rules about
crossword is this: no pencils.

30:35.299 --> 30:38.928
Doing a crossword with a pencil is like
screaming with your lips duct-taped together.

30:39.036 --> 30:41.834
<i>It is weak.</i>
<i>If you're going to do a crossword puzzle...</i>

30:41.939 --> 30:45.272
you need to do it fearlessly
and with abandon and with a pen.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.536
I prefer medium felt-tip blue.

30:47.644 --> 30:51.102
It's about choosing your path, Norm,
and just committing to it.

30:52.449 --> 30:55.043
<i>Well, I figure that
when you miss a bus...</i>

30:55.152 --> 30:57.177
maybe you weren't meant to take it.

30:59.423 --> 31:02.620
Hmm.

31:02.726 --> 31:05.593
<i>Are you familiar with, uh-</i>
<i>with, uh, moon blindness, Norm?</i>

31:05.696 --> 31:08.062
- It's like this awful eye pus that starts to ooze-
<i>- You know...</i>

31:08.165 --> 31:10.895
quiet time might be real
good right about now.

31:11.935 --> 31:14.597
Oh. Okay.

31:16.306 --> 31:18.274
Quiet. <i>Silencio.</i>

31:18.375 --> 31:20.343
<i>Ruhe.</i>

31:22.579 --> 31:24.638
Hey, Norm.

31:24.748 --> 31:25.976
Mary?

31:26.083 --> 31:28.745
Thanks for not raping me.

31:30.687 --> 31:32.985
My pleasure.

31:35.993 --> 31:40.862
<i> Howdy, partners!</i>
<i>Welcome to Wild Willy's Ol' Western Town!</i>

31:40.964 --> 31:44.400
<i>Howdy, partners! Welcome to</i>
<i>Wild Willy's Ol' Western Town!</i>

31:47.037 --> 31:50.632
All righty. Give my love to the kids.

31:50.741 --> 31:53.801
Good luck. And if that Steve
shows you any disrespect-

31:53.911 --> 31:55.811
Disrespect. Well, if you mean unmannerly...

31:55.913 --> 31:57.972
tactless and vulgar,
he is a straight man, Norman.

31:58.081 --> 32:00.572
Some things can't be helped.
But if you mean that he's someone-

32:00.684 --> 32:02.276
See ya, Mary.

32:03.854 --> 32:07.255
See ya, Norm.

32:18.135 --> 32:22.094
<i>- # I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart #</i>

32:22.205 --> 32:25.641
<i># I want to learn to rope and ride #</i>

32:25.742 --> 32:29.769
<i># I want to ride o'er the plains and the desert #</i>

32:51.969 --> 32:54.233
<i>What happened?</i>

32:54.338 --> 32:58.468
<i>They're all safe.</i>
<i>The man surrendered. </i>

33:01.044 --> 33:02.602
<i> Crap.</i>

33:07.150 --> 33:09.345
<i>- Adiós.</i>
<i>- Adiós, señora.</i>

33:15.192 --> 33:16.591
<i>What did they say?</i>

33:16.693 --> 33:18.024
<i>- Baby Peggy...</i>
<i>- ¿Sí?</i>

33:18.128 --> 33:19.254
<i>- in Oklahoma...</i>
<i>- ¿Sí?</i>

33:19.696 --> 33:20.890
<i>Poor little thing.</i>

33:20.998 --> 33:24.525
Oh. Oh. <i>Gracias. Gracias, señor.</i>

33:24.634 --> 33:26.158
<i>- De nada.</i>
<i>- ¡Hasta luego!</i>

33:26.269 --> 33:27.497
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

33:27.671 --> 33:30.367
...Guadalupe Aguero, or to us, Baby Peggy...

33:30.474 --> 33:34.706
was born with an extremely rare
birth defect: a third leg.

33:34.811 --> 33:37.746
Shortly after the birth,
her poor immigrant parents separated.

33:37.848 --> 33:42.046
Now with joint custody, one parent wants
the abnormal baby to keep the third leg.

33:42.152 --> 33:44.780
- The other wants it gone.
- After months of legal wrangling...

33:44.888 --> 33:46.788
the judge has ordered
in favor of the mother.

33:46.890 --> 33:48.858
Amputation surgery is
scheduled for tomorrow...

33:48.959 --> 33:51.018
but the father, Mr. Aguero,
isn't about to give up.

33:51.128 --> 33:55.224
As his lawyers work to
secure an injunction...

33:55.332 --> 33:59.268
the father continues to rally support
around the rogue leg.

33:59.369 --> 34:03.328
I'm quoting. " If God didn't want
my daughter to have a third leg...

34:03.440 --> 34:06.432
he wouldn't have stuck one
between the other two."

34:06.543 --> 34:09.670
So, for now, the fate
of the precious child's third leg...

34:09.780 --> 34:12.806
is in the hands of a judge.

34:12.916 --> 34:16.043
Hartman Hughes,
reporting from Oklahoma City...

34:16.152 --> 34:20.112
near the leg,
and as always, from the edge.

34:20.223 --> 34:23.283
- Cut.
- Okay. What do you think?

34:23.393 --> 34:25.793
In the next segment,
I was thinking about saying...

34:25.896 --> 34:29.263
"Baby Peggy is in
a three-legged race against time."

34:29.366 --> 34:32.335
- What do you think?
- Okay.

34:32.436 --> 34:34.460
- Wanna do some one-on-ones?
- Do it.

34:34.571 --> 34:38.405
Okay. Just intelligent
arguments from both sides.

34:38.507 --> 34:40.408
Intelligent arguments, guys!

34:40.510 --> 34:45.072
I was born with a vestigial penis.
That means a penis hanging outside the body.

34:45.181 --> 34:48.549
You know, like yours. I'm talking about
a ding-a-ling. Know what I'm saying?

34:48.652 --> 34:52.884
And it was pretty good size. I was kind of
proud of it. I got to be in seventh grade.

34:52.989 --> 34:56.686
I used to work it, hang it on the side
in gym class. I got all the attention.

34:56.793 --> 35:01.059
<i>Now there's just a big old scar.</i>
<i>Can you feel it? Can you feel that scar?</i>

35:01.164 --> 35:04.395
Right? Okay. So, they cut it off, then-

35:04.501 --> 35:06.935
What? What happened? H- I wasn't finished.

35:07.037 --> 35:10.700
- That was unbelievable.
- Yeah, that was the, uh, highlight of my morning.

35:12.809 --> 35:14.276
- Vasquez.
- Where?

35:14.377 --> 35:17.175
<i>Oh. That's a new Escalade.</i>

35:17.280 --> 35:19.771
<i>He's got three security guards.</i>

35:19.883 --> 35:22.351
Look at that. He brought toys.

35:24.454 --> 35:28.515
Ooh, that's that guy from the news.
Hey. You with the baby. Hey.

35:28.625 --> 35:33.119
Son of a bitch.
He's got a three-legged doll baby. Angus!

36:24.614 --> 36:25.842
What?

36:26.983 --> 36:29.417
Oh, no.

36:29.519 --> 36:32.511
<i>#Love him, I love him, I love him #</i>

36:32.622 --> 36:36.251
<i># And where he goes</i>
<i>I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow #</i>

36:36.359 --> 36:39.886
<i># I will follow him #</i>

36:39.996 --> 36:43.397
<i># Follow him wherever he may go #</i>

36:43.500 --> 36:44.865
- Hi!
- Oh!

36:44.968 --> 36:48.096
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi.

36:48.205 --> 36:49.638
Hey. Oh.

36:49.739 --> 36:52.367
- How are ya? Hey!
- I'm good. Surprise!

36:52.475 --> 36:54.602
Yeah, I didn't- I-Yeah.

36:54.711 --> 36:57.646
- Look at you, here.
- Sorry it took me so long.

36:57.747 --> 37:00.215
- It did. It did.
- Yeah.

37:00.702 --> 37:02.547
Oh, I brought your-
I brought your umbrella back.

37:02.652 --> 37:05.246
- And I got a surprise-
- Oh. I have a lot, but that's fine.

37:05.355 --> 37:07.915
that I know you love.

37:08.024 --> 37:11.721
Oh. Wow. That's, uh-

37:11.828 --> 37:14.388
That's-Wow. That's scary thoughtful.

37:14.497 --> 37:17.227
- Thanks. Thank you.
- I-I-I know you love them. Twinkies.

37:17.334 --> 37:20.728
So, you-you-you came here
all the way just to see me?

37:20.729 --> 37:21.168
Yes, sir.

37:21.271 --> 37:23.637
"Ask and you shall receive."
You know who said that?

37:23.740 --> 37:26.368
- No.
- Jesus.

37:26.476 --> 37:29.809
Did Jesus tell you to come here?

37:29.913 --> 37:33.815
Jesus ask me to come here.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.112
- No. You did.
- Oh. No. No.

37:36.219 --> 37:37.846
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

37:37.954 --> 37:39.649
- Yes, you did.
- I don't think so.

37:39.756 --> 37:41.883
Yes. Right after you fondled my breasts.
Remember?

37:41.992 --> 37:44.222
- Who?
- You. Remember?

37:44.327 --> 37:46.522
- Oh.
- " Oh, life on the road sure is awful.

37:46.630 --> 37:49.326
Sure would be great if you could
be out there with me."

37:49.432 --> 37:51.332
Oh, yeah.

37:51.434 --> 37:53.664
With your big old hands.
Just grabbed my little puppies and-

37:53.770 --> 37:56.295
- Yeah.
- went to town.

37:56.406 --> 37:58.670
- It felt good.
- Good.

37:58.775 --> 38:00.800
- Yeah.
- Uh, well, that's great.

38:00.910 --> 38:04.437
Yeah. It will be great,
because you are making journalistic history-

38:04.547 --> 38:07.573
- Oh. That's sweet of you to say.
- and I will be right by your side...

38:07.684 --> 38:09.982
for- for support and encouragement...

38:10.086 --> 38:11.986
and whatever, like...

38:12.088 --> 38:15.316
nurturing and-and coddling
you as a man should require.

38:15.317 --> 38:15.489
Okay.

38:15.592 --> 38:17.822
I'm-I'm pretty much a one-man team.
It's just-

38:17.927 --> 38:20.953
It's- It's just me and, uh, my camera.
God, yeah.

38:21.064 --> 38:22.964
- You know what? And yes.
- Can't believe it.

38:23.066 --> 38:25.500
You know, the news- the news needs you.
Look.

38:25.602 --> 38:27.661
Because I-I bet my left ovary...

38:27.771 --> 38:31.332
that that- that's Baby Peggy's daddy
leaving the hospital to avoid the press.

38:31.441 --> 38:33.966
- Right there. Look.
- Oh, no, that's a nurse.

38:34.077 --> 38:34.543
No. Right-

38:34.544 --> 38:37.012
No, they're all dressed like-
There's a lot of nurses.

38:37.113 --> 38:38.584
'Cause we're at a hospital.

38:38.585 --> 38:41.743
But a- But a nurse not wearing
sterilized nonslip footwear?

38:41.851 --> 38:45.184
- What?
<i>- Look.</i>

38:45.288 --> 38:47.654
Oh! Ho-Holy shit! You're right.

38:47.757 --> 38:51.022
- Yeah. I- I should, uh-Thank you.
- Go, Steven with a "V."

38:51.127 --> 38:53.823
First priority, your-your occupation.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.830
Second priority, fornication!

38:57.934 --> 38:59.959
Fornication.

39:00.070 --> 39:01.970
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes. Ooh. Sorry?

39:02.072 --> 39:04.006
- Only media are allowed up here.
- Oh. Absolutely.

39:04.107 --> 39:06.371
My credentials, kind sir.

39:07.444 --> 39:09.878
- "Cruciverbalist"?
<i>- Sí.</i>

39:09.979 --> 39:13.437
You gotta stay down there with your friends.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.882
My friends.

39:15.985 --> 39:18.988
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

39:19.089 --> 39:22.115
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

39:22.225 --> 39:25.353
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

39:25.462 --> 39:28.727
Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!

39:28.832 --> 39:32.233
- Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!
- Again!

39:32.335 --> 39:34.303
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

39:36.806 --> 39:39.400
<i>Okay, guys. That's 30.
That was fantastic.</i>

39:40.877 --> 39:43.710
<i>Hi there. I like your boots.</i>

39:43.813 --> 39:46.373
Oh. Thanks.

39:46.483 --> 39:49.543
Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?

39:49.652 --> 39:51.643
Neither really.

39:51.755 --> 39:54.656
Well, um, this is the
pro-leg group over here.

39:54.758 --> 39:59.058
Oh, we are supporting Baby Peggy's dad
in the fight to save the baby's third leg.

39:59.162 --> 40:02.222
- Oh, wow.
- Um, over there-Well, those are the anti-leggers.

40:02.332 --> 40:05.995
Well, is the, uh- is the additional leg
functioning or non-functioning?

40:06.102 --> 40:10.937
Because if it has full mobility, it's both
a physical asset and a medical phenomenon.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.941
Those are a lot of words.

40:14.043 --> 40:16.341
- And they're kind of big. I don't understand.
- Sorry.

40:16.446 --> 40:19.938
In addition to promoting
a righteous cause...

40:20.049 --> 40:22.142
the pro-leggers have better snacks.

40:25.088 --> 40:27.022
Okay. I'm, um...

40:27.123 --> 40:29.023
definitely pro-leg then.

40:29.125 --> 40:32.094
Yea!

40:32.195 --> 40:34.925
Come around.
You can help light the rest of the candles.

40:35.031 --> 40:37.397
Okay. Okay.

40:39.602 --> 40:41.695
Love those boots.

40:41.805 --> 40:44.535
<i> Angus. Footage of
the dad leaving the scene.</i>

40:44.641 --> 40:47.337
- Nice work.
<i>- Right?</i>

40:47.444 --> 40:49.674
- How'd you get that?
- Uh-

40:51.648 --> 40:55.175
This is Hartman Hughes
reporting from the edge.

40:59.889 --> 41:01.823
You remember the blind date I went on?

41:01.925 --> 41:03.950
- Yeah. The one who did the crossword.
- Yeah.

41:04.060 --> 41:05.960
She followed me here.

41:06.062 --> 41:08.553
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:08.665 --> 41:12.726
I mean, I saw her at the bridge, and I- I think
she's with the protesters. She has red boots.

41:12.836 --> 41:14.565
- Is she attractive?
- I mean, who cares?

41:14.671 --> 41:18.163
I've been married to the same woman
for nine years. I care.

41:18.274 --> 41:21.300
- I think she thinks that I invited her here.
- Did you?

41:21.411 --> 41:24.039
No. I mean, well-

41:24.147 --> 41:26.047
Kind of. I mean-

41:26.149 --> 41:29.550
But I was just trying to be nice, you know,
to get her out of my truck.

41:29.652 --> 41:32.018
You could have tried "Get out of my truck."

41:32.121 --> 41:34.555
I can't be held responsible
for being a nice guy, right?

41:34.657 --> 41:38.093
No. Of course not. Unless she's
doing a crossword all about you...

41:38.194 --> 41:40.856
and following you
across the country like a stalker.

41:40.964 --> 41:43.432
Stalker?

41:43.533 --> 41:45.763
- Who has a stalker?
- Steve does. Big-time.

41:45.869 --> 41:48.394
- No, no, no, no. What?
- Big-time.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.939
Really? What's going on with that?

41:51.040 --> 41:55.340
<i>No, I was telling him about Mary. Remember Mary,</i>
<i>the blind date my parents set me up on?</i>

41:55.445 --> 41:57.379
She was on me like a
mountain lion in the truck.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.074
Great in theory, but...
wouldn't stop talking.

42:00.183 --> 42:02.083
She was like a talking encyclopedia.

42:04.053 --> 42:06.044
So, uh, is she here, or-

42:06.155 --> 42:08.020
No. No, no, no. I think she went up-

42:08.124 --> 42:10.422
Red boots, with the protesters. Hot.

42:10.527 --> 42:12.495
Red boots?

42:12.595 --> 42:14.893
- You bang a fireman?
- No.

42:14.998 --> 42:17.762
No, I did not bang a fireman.

42:17.867 --> 42:20.028
Hmm.

42:20.136 --> 42:23.469
All right.
I'm gonna go outside...

42:23.573 --> 42:26.736
and get some, uh, snacks.

42:26.843 --> 42:29.243
- You want anything?
<i>- Oh, man. I could use a club soda...</i>

42:29.345 --> 42:31.973
<i>with shaved ice with a twist of lemon.</i>

42:37.687 --> 42:40.349
- Awesome. He's getting me drinks.
- You think that's where he's going?

42:40.456 --> 42:40.652
Yeah!

42:40.653 --> 42:42.890
That's not where he's going.
I don't know what he's up to.

42:42.992 --> 42:44.755
He's always thinking about something.

42:44.894 --> 42:48.295
<i>- # Save the leg, my friend #
- This glue is making me high.</i>

42:48.398 --> 42:49.414
<i># Save the leg #</i>

42:49.415 --> 42:51.799
It's the, uh-
It's the methylbenzene in there, Winston.

42:51.901 --> 42:53.801
- Give me that.
<i>- # Save the leg, my friend ##</i>

42:53.903 --> 42:56.167
Here.

42:56.272 --> 42:58.240
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi.

42:58.341 --> 43:00.241
- Uh, can I help?
- Oh, sure.

43:00.343 --> 43:03.676
Mary, have you met Howard?
Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard.

43:03.780 --> 43:07.841
- How do you do?
- Uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean.

43:07.951 --> 43:10.419
Uh-

43:10.520 --> 43:13.114
I'm just gonna sit down.

43:13.222 --> 43:15.690
- So, what can I do?
- Can you, um- Can you do the ribbon?

43:15.792 --> 43:18.488
- Yes.
- Okay. Here's scissors if you need them.

43:20.563 --> 43:23.464
- Mary.
- Oh, hey. That's that news guy.

43:23.566 --> 43:25.193
Hartman Hughes.

43:25.301 --> 43:28.099
So, this is the pro-legger camp.

43:28.204 --> 43:30.172
- Yeah.
- Handsome group.

43:30.273 --> 43:32.173
<i>That's right.</i>

43:32.275 --> 43:34.607
You folks are all for
keeping Baby Peggy abnormal.

43:34.711 --> 43:37.942
- Abnormal?
- Extra legs equals extra awesomeness.

43:38.047 --> 43:39.981
<i>- Yeah.</i>

43:40.083 --> 43:43.109
- She'd just be like the tree frog.
- Come again?

43:43.219 --> 43:45.346
A trematode parasite causes polymely-

43:45.455 --> 43:48.049
that means "extra limbs"- in-in
tree frogs. Yeah.

43:48.157 --> 43:50.557
Happens all the time.
It's-It's totally normal.

43:50.660 --> 43:52.637
<i>In some ponds,</i>
<i>there's a quarter of the tree frogs-</i>

43:52.638 --> 43:53.026
Hartman Hughes!

43:53.129 --> 43:55.120
with extra limbs,
and sometimes they found that if-

43:55.231 --> 43:57.131
You know, over at the media tent...

43:57.233 --> 43:59.599
we're gonna take a break in a few minutes...

43:59.702 --> 44:02.466
and, uh, sure enough like you to join me.

44:02.572 --> 44:05.905
Oh.
I can't. Um, I have flute lessons.

44:09.012 --> 44:12.573
Will Steve be there?

44:13.850 --> 44:16.341
- Who do you think sent me?
- Oh.

44:16.452 --> 44:18.886
<i>All right, girl. You go, girl.</i>

44:18.988 --> 44:21.513
Go on to that media tent with your bad self.

44:21.624 --> 44:23.524
<i>Go get your man, honey.</i>

44:23.626 --> 44:25.560
- I'll be right back.
<i>- Holler if you need backup.</i>

44:25.662 --> 44:29.022
Did Steve tell you all about
the crossword I did for him?

44:29.023 --> 44:29.428
Oh, yeah.

44:29.532 --> 44:32.296
There's no words to describe
how much it meant to him.

44:32.402 --> 44:34.597
Oh, but there are. There are always words.

44:34.704 --> 44:36.604
- You know-
- Yes?

44:36.706 --> 44:39.641
It's easy to see
why he fell for you the way he did.

44:39.742 --> 44:41.710
Oh.

44:42.945 --> 44:44.913
So, he, uh- Oh, yeah.

44:45.014 --> 44:48.006
he told you all about
the incredible connection and intensity...

44:48.117 --> 44:50.017
- and je ne sais quoi?
- Oh, yeah.

44:50.119 --> 44:52.087
He told me about the quoi.

44:52.188 --> 44:54.452
He wouldn't shut his piehole about the quoi.

44:54.557 --> 44:58.015
But, you know,
his bliss is tempered with fear.

44:58.127 --> 44:59.685
- Oh.
- When you saw him today...

44:59.796 --> 45:03.027
did he seem like a man
whose heart and loins were full of joy?

45:03.132 --> 45:05.600
<i>Um-</i>

45:05.702 --> 45:08.466
I- I-I-I don't know. I don't know if- if-

45:08.571 --> 45:10.471
- Mmm, no.
- No.

45:10.573 --> 45:12.473
- It's because he's afraid, Mary.
- Oh.

45:12.575 --> 45:15.635
He's afraid you're gonna... break his heart.

45:15.745 --> 45:18.646
But I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do
that to Steve. I could never do that.

45:18.748 --> 45:21.239
- I'm incapable-
- Shh.

45:21.350 --> 45:24.012
You rest those pretty
little mouth pillows, huh?

45:24.120 --> 45:26.884
You're gonna need 'em later
for all sorts of naughtiness.

45:26.989 --> 45:29.549
What I need to know from you right now...

45:29.659 --> 45:34.289
are you gonna stick around long enough
to help us work through Steve's fear?

45:34.397 --> 45:36.297
- Oh. Of course. Of course. Yes.
- Ah.

45:36.399 --> 45:39.459
- If he tells you to go, you don't go.
- Mm-hmm. No? Okay.

45:39.569 --> 45:44.472
Mm-mmm. He starts throwing words around
like "cuckoo" and "loony" and "crazy"...

45:44.574 --> 45:46.474
- that's his fear talking.
- Oh.

45:46.576 --> 45:48.476
- All right?
- Okay. Okay. Yes.

45:48.578 --> 45:52.446
If he tries to run away,
I want you to grab him.

45:52.548 --> 45:52.834
Okay.

45:52.835 --> 45:55.642
And with the strength that
God gives you, hang on.

45:55.752 --> 45:57.242
- Be calm and focused.
- Okay. Okay.

45:57.353 --> 45:59.253
- You wanna know why?
- Why? Yeah. Why?

45:59.355 --> 46:01.687
You're the rock in this relationship.

46:01.791 --> 46:03.691
I'm the rock.

46:03.793 --> 46:07.285
- You're the glue that holds it together.
- I'm the glue. Okay.

46:07.396 --> 46:10.331
Right here. Look at me. Focus.

46:11.868 --> 46:14.302
Are you gonna soldier on...

46:14.403 --> 46:16.303
no matter what happens?

46:16.405 --> 46:18.635
Of course.

46:18.741 --> 46:20.641
- Of course.
- Good.

46:20.743 --> 46:24.201
You know what I see in those big, beautiful eyes?

46:25.314 --> 46:27.214
Plica semilunaris secretions?

46:27.316 --> 46:29.216
Do I have something in my eye?

46:31.287 --> 46:33.346
Bravery.

46:34.390 --> 46:37.723
Hmm. Well, I'm a little nervous.

46:37.827 --> 46:42.355
- Now you go get your Steve on.
- Okay. Okay.

46:42.465 --> 46:45.127
<i>- You said she was hyper?</i>
- Yeah, she's really hyper.

46:45.234 --> 46:47.566
That's good. That's good.
The calm and focused ones...

46:47.670 --> 46:50.036
they keep all that bottled up inside,
and before you know it-

46:52.575 --> 46:55.544
You know? But as long as she's hyper,
you don't have to worry about it.

46:55.645 --> 46:57.840
One thing she isn't is calm.

46:57.947 --> 47:00.211
- Dude.
- Something you wanna tell me?

47:00.316 --> 47:02.409
- Dude. Is that her?
- Hmm?

47:02.518 --> 47:04.486
Is that her?

47:07.990 --> 47:09.924
Oh.

47:10.026 --> 47:10.993
Want some?

47:14.997 --> 47:16.828
Okay.

47:16.933 --> 47:19.834
- How'd she get in here?
- I don't know. She's calm.

47:21.671 --> 47:25.437
Boy, did I miss you, Steven with a "V."

47:25.541 --> 47:28.772
- Let's go for a talk outside.
- Okay. Walkie-talk.

47:28.878 --> 47:30.778
- Right out here.
- Okay.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.848
All right.

47:34.016 --> 47:36.780
- Oops. Yes?
- Okay.

47:36.886 --> 47:38.911
- You can't stay here.
- Sure I can.

47:39.021 --> 47:41.216
- No.
- That's the beauty of my job. I can send in...

47:41.324 --> 47:44.293
- crossword puzzles from anywhere in the world.
- No. Listen. Listen. Okay.

47:44.393 --> 47:46.953
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm?

47:47.063 --> 47:49.031
I don't want you here. Okay?

47:49.131 --> 47:51.031
But you said.

47:51.133 --> 47:53.465
I said- I know- I'm a guy. Okay?

47:53.569 --> 47:55.867
We say things we don't mean.

47:55.972 --> 47:59.135
Well, then, how do I know
you mean what you're saying now...

47:59.242 --> 48:02.132
when you said you didn't mean
what you said?

48:02.133 --> 48:02.700
That's crazy.

48:02.812 --> 48:05.542
Well, see, that's your fear talking.

48:05.648 --> 48:08.208
Why are you so calm?

48:08.317 --> 48:11.616
How come you're not more hyper?
That's freaking me out a bit. I gotta be honest.

48:11.721 --> 48:13.985
- Steve, it's all gonna be okay.
- I know it is, if you-

48:14.090 --> 48:15.990
Maybe even wonderful.

48:16.092 --> 48:18.617
- Hartman Hughes told me everything.
- What?

48:18.728 --> 48:20.628
- I talked to Hartman Hughes.
- When did you talk to him?

48:20.730 --> 48:22.721
- It doesn't matter.
- Did he- Did he come get you?

48:22.832 --> 48:24.732
- Steve.
- Where is he? Hughes.

48:24.834 --> 48:28.930
Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven. Come here.
Look at me. You here? Are you here with me?

48:29.038 --> 48:30.938
- Okay.
- Focus. Right here. Okay? Look at me.

48:31.040 --> 48:34.840
"Intimate relationships
cannot substitute for a life plan...

48:34.944 --> 48:37.845
"but to have any meaning
or validity at all...

48:37.947 --> 48:41.280
a life plan must include
intimate relationships."

48:41.384 --> 48:43.079
Do you know who said that?

48:43.185 --> 48:44.618
- Jesus?
- Harriet Lerner.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.654
- Oh.
- Psychologist, lecturer and author...

48:46.756 --> 48:50.749
of the timeless classic
<i>Franny B. Kranny, There's a Bird in Your Hair!</i>

48:50.860 --> 48:53.693
- I was gonna run for governor, but-
- Hey, Hughes.

48:53.796 --> 48:55.024
- Come here.
<i>- Hey.</i>

48:55.131 --> 48:57.827
- Come here.
- Steve.

48:57.934 --> 48:59.925
- Yes, sir.
- This another one of your pranks? Huh?

49:00.036 --> 49:03.836
I don't know what you're into, lago,
but you better tell her the truth, okay?

49:03.940 --> 49:07.432
I'm a newsman. I'm incapable of
saying anything but the truth.

49:07.543 --> 49:12.674
Okay. Well, then tell her you lied and-
and that I really-

49:12.782 --> 49:14.682
I don't want you here. I'm sorry.

49:14.784 --> 49:16.376
Okay.

49:23.759 --> 49:26.057
Sorry. Just...

49:26.162 --> 49:28.562
<i>things didn't work out.</i>

49:28.664 --> 49:30.598
You're gonna find a great guy.

49:30.700 --> 49:32.167
Baby.

49:32.268 --> 49:34.395
What is that?

49:35.504 --> 49:37.563
I want you guys to have a baby.

49:37.673 --> 49:39.038
Why?

49:39.141 --> 49:40.802
You guys belong together.

49:42.111 --> 49:44.170
- I'm gonna hit you, man.
- Aw, come on.

49:44.280 --> 49:46.646
You're not gonna hit the face of CCN-

49:46.749 --> 49:51.186
Stop it! " Victory attained through violence
is tantamount to defeat, for it is momentary."

49:51.287 --> 49:53.414
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Do you know who said it? Gandhi. Gandhi.

49:53.522 --> 49:55.752
- What are you afraid of?
- What am I afraid of?

49:55.858 --> 49:58.793
You don't want her to know about
"I heart Mary" carved in a tree trunk?

49:58.894 --> 50:00.885
Why are you putting stuff
like that in her head?

50:00.997 --> 50:02.897
- You said that?
- No, I never said that.

50:02.999 --> 50:05.365
Maybe you're afraid the great Hartman Hughes
is gonna steal her away.

50:05.468 --> 50:08.869
- You're crazy!
- I'm like Helen of Troy. No fights!

50:08.971 --> 50:11.997
Hey, guys!
Baby Peggy's parents settled.

50:12.108 --> 50:15.600
- Steve, your camera.
- Oh, Jesus, Angus!

50:15.711 --> 50:17.235
- Sorry. Sorry.
- See what happens?

50:17.346 --> 50:18.904
You mess with me, you mess with my boy.

50:19.015 --> 50:21.449
- Mary, stay! Mary, stay!
- But you-

50:21.550 --> 50:23.415
- Mary!
<i>- Call the station.</i>

50:24.820 --> 50:26.412
- Mary!
<i>- We're live in two minutes!</i>

50:26.522 --> 50:28.251
Tissue.

50:28.357 --> 50:31.952
With mere hours to spare,
the Agueros reconciled...

50:32.061 --> 50:36.589
agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy
is old enough to decide for herself.

50:36.699 --> 50:40.465
It's time for the Agueros
to be a family once again.

50:40.569 --> 50:43.504
So today, like the noble tree frog...

50:43.606 --> 50:46.200
whose third leg is nothing if not natural...

50:46.308 --> 50:50.074
<i>Baby Peggy marches on with
her three-legged life.</i>

50:50.179 --> 50:52.079
Steve! I'm coming. Excuse me.

50:52.181 --> 50:54.581
<i>Medical emergency.</i>
<i>Thank you. Please allow me through.</i>

50:54.683 --> 50:56.446
Possible concussion,
could faint at any time.

50:56.552 --> 50:59.248
- Steve, I'm coming.
- No, no. Ma'am, you can't go back there.

51:04.727 --> 51:06.752
<i>Are you all right?</i>

51:06.862 --> 51:09.092
Could someone please help him?

51:09.198 --> 51:12.725
Maybe apply a vasoconstrictor
or a nasal tampon? Please.

51:12.835 --> 51:16.566
She trying to kill me? She's trying to kill me.

51:16.672 --> 51:20.574
This is Hartman Hughes report-

51:20.676 --> 51:22.576
What the hell was that?

51:22.678 --> 51:24.908
It's this girl who Steve invited, sir.

51:25.014 --> 51:28.814
I didn't invite her. She's stalking me.

51:28.918 --> 51:31.478
Never mind.

51:31.587 --> 51:33.714
There's a hurricane off the coast of Texas.
Get to it.

51:33.823 --> 51:35.723
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.

51:35.825 --> 51:38.692
If you three weren't the closest crew to Galveston,
you'd be hitchhiking home by now.

51:38.794 --> 51:40.694
- Yes, sir.
- Get off the phone.

51:40.796 --> 51:43.321
Did you hear that about the tree frog?

51:43.432 --> 51:46.094
Every time she speaks, I smell anchor desk.

51:46.202 --> 51:49.035
I get it, Hartman. You're trying
to get back at me, but Mary's not the way.

51:49.138 --> 51:51.163
She's insane. She tried to kill me.

51:51.273 --> 51:52.604
Hartman, something's wrong with her.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.903
- You didn't see that?
- You fell down. Boo-hoo.

51:55.010 --> 51:57.069
I fell down? My legs were
taken out from under me.

51:57.179 --> 51:59.374
What are you talking about?
She's stalking me.

51:59.482 --> 52:01.313
<i>- Dude, she's not stalking you.</i>
<i>- Steve!</i>

52:01.417 --> 52:04.614
Oh, shit! Tell her I'm not
here. Tell her I'm not here.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.017
- Steve. Hi, guys.
- Hello, Mary.

52:06.122 --> 52:08.716
Hi. I'm so sorry I was detained.

52:08.824 --> 52:11.190
<i>I was questioned by authorities about an
apparent crime against one of your coworkers.</i>

52:11.293 --> 52:13.056
But all's been resolved. Steve.

52:13.162 --> 52:15.790
Considering you almost cost us our job,
maybe now's not a great time.

52:15.898 --> 52:19.163
I'm so sorry.
I could call your employer and apologize.

52:19.268 --> 52:21.065
I can actually apologize
in 17 different languages.

52:21.170 --> 52:24.003
Huh.

52:24.106 --> 52:27.507
So, Mary, we're going to Galveston.
There's a big storm there.

52:27.610 --> 52:29.305
- What do you know about Galveston?
- What are you doing?

52:29.411 --> 52:32.812
Great. Galveston.
Well, Galveston's the South's new gay mecca-

52:32.915 --> 52:34.906
one of the country's
top 10 gay-friendliest cities.

52:35.017 --> 52:37.144
- Huh. Gay friendly, Angus.
- Yeah. Hi, Steve.

52:37.253 --> 52:38.720
Is she running alongside the van?

52:38.821 --> 52:40.516
- What else you got?
<i>- Oh.</i>

52:40.623 --> 52:42.921
<i>- Biggest natural disaster in American history.</i>
- Really?

52:43.025 --> 52:46.324
Over 6,000 dead in Galveston alone. Yeah.
Ten- Can I have that?

52:46.428 --> 52:50.387
- Ten nuns and 90 orphans.
<i>- Angus, go faster.</i>

52:50.499 --> 52:53.593
- Ask her why she's following me. Please.
- Why are you stalking him?

52:53.702 --> 52:57.570
I'm not-
I'm not stalking. No, I'm not stalking.

52:57.673 --> 52:59.868
Stalking's an obsessive pursuit of prey.

52:59.975 --> 53:02.102
But you're kind of
following alongside his van.

53:02.211 --> 53:03.678
Who wouldn't?

53:03.779 --> 53:08.182
Steven is a smart, decent, loving-
If he allows himself, right?

53:08.284 --> 53:11.014
Loving, talented human being
with deep-seated fears.

53:11.120 --> 53:13.942
<i>I'm not going anywhere, Steve.</i>
<i>I'm your rock. I'm your glue.</i>

53:13.943 --> 53:14.055
Mary.

53:14.156 --> 53:16.386
- Steve, hi.
- Go home. Go.

53:19.361 --> 53:21.124
Oh.

53:21.230 --> 53:23.596
You should come!

53:28.771 --> 53:31.239
<i>You know what word you
never see in crosswords?</i>

53:31.340 --> 53:35.106
<i>"Go." That or any other two-letter words.</i>

53:35.211 --> 53:37.475
<i>The word "go"-not fun.</i>

53:37.580 --> 53:40.481
<i>The word "vamoose"-
now that's super fun.</i>

53:42.051 --> 53:45.145
<i>Yes. Crosswords are a lot
like life in that way.</i>

53:45.254 --> 53:47.745
<i>They're only boring</i>
<i>if you have no sense of adventure.</i>

53:47.856 --> 53:51.292
We didn't get to light
all the candles, Howard.

53:51.393 --> 53:53.361
- That's okay. We can save them.
- Okay. Ooh.

53:53.462 --> 53:55.623
Hi, Mary. Where you been?

53:55.731 --> 53:59.030
I'm-I'm going to-
I'm going to go meet Steve at his next job.

53:59.134 --> 54:00.829
- Oh.
- Yeah. Galveston.

54:00.936 --> 54:02.733
Yes, it's a storm.

54:02.838 --> 54:06.399
<i>Could you sign my autograph
book before you go?</i>

54:06.508 --> 54:09.306
Yeah, if I, uh- If I had a- a car...

54:09.411 --> 54:12.312
<i>on my way to Galveston,</i>
<i>I could go through Durant, Oklahoma...</i>

54:12.414 --> 54:15.144
where they have the world's largest peanut.

54:15.251 --> 54:18.448
I love peanuts, especially the giant ones.

54:18.554 --> 54:20.954
- Yeah, well, who doesn't?
- I know.

54:21.056 --> 54:23.115
Love them.

54:23.225 --> 54:25.090
<i>- There you go.</i>
- I'll drive.

54:26.629 --> 54:29.097
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

54:31.033 --> 54:33.228
All right. Vamoose.

54:37.973 --> 54:39.873
Vamoose indeed.

54:41.110 --> 54:44.876
- So, uh, what kind of car do you have?
- A Gremlin.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.345
- What year?
- '76.

54:46.448 --> 54:48.916
- Did you replace the two-wire ignition connector?
- Yes.

54:49.018 --> 54:52.476
The reverse doesn't work, and sometimes
it stalls. But otherwise, it's good as new.

54:52.588 --> 54:53.748
This storm could be nasty.

54:53.856 --> 54:55.619
Are we sure that we wanna drive into it?

54:55.724 --> 54:57.624
Come on. How bad could it be, right?

54:57.793 --> 55:00.762
<i>Storm Watch!</i>

55:00.863 --> 55:04.822
<i>Hurricane LaQuisha expected to
make landfall by tomorrow morning.</i>

55:04.933 --> 55:07.527
And what makes this situation
even more frightening-

55:07.636 --> 55:10.332
that area of Texas currently in the midst...

55:10.439 --> 55:13.738
of the worst tornado season in history.

55:13.842 --> 55:16.402
And here's where things get interesting.

55:16.512 --> 55:18.878
<i>Add a looming cicada migration...</i>

55:18.981 --> 55:22.417
<i>and no one knows just how devastating</i>
<i>this storm could be.</i>

55:22.518 --> 55:26.215
Did you know that back in the '80s when
everyone's concern was with the aerosol cans...

55:26.322 --> 55:29.849
it was actually the cows and their gases...

55:29.958 --> 55:33.018
which were actually
doing the most damage to the ozone layer?

55:35.731 --> 55:38.996
<i>- # Turn off your radio #
<i>- # Come on, come on #</i></i>

55:39.101 --> 55:42.195
<i># You're gonna feel all right #</i>

55:42.304 --> 55:45.740
<i># Let's do the panic tonight ##</i>

55:49.912 --> 55:52.847
A little wrinkled old lady.

55:52.948 --> 55:56.076
Yeah, that's Mother Teresa.
She's my best seller.

55:56.185 --> 55:58.278
- I'm an apple sculptor.
<i>- Really?</i>

55:58.387 --> 56:00.821
I love apples.

56:00.923 --> 56:02.618
- Yeah?
- I do.

56:02.725 --> 56:05.455
Well, I went to school for physics,
but I got bored.

56:05.561 --> 56:10.362
So I, uh- So now I just make these
and sell them on AppleHeadsRule.com.

56:10.466 --> 56:12.297
<i>Here, let me show you another one.</i>

56:12.401 --> 56:14.301
- Oh! Clay Aiken!
<i>- Yeah, it's Clay Aiken.</i>

56:14.403 --> 56:17.338
I love him!

56:17.439 --> 56:19.407
You know, I was sitting at home...

56:19.508 --> 56:23.444
just thinking that I had
everything I needed right there.

56:23.545 --> 56:28.608
And then I just thought,
maybe there's more, you know?

56:28.717 --> 56:31.117
Maybe this is the road
I'm supposed to be on.

56:35.791 --> 56:38.316
Maybe it is.

56:38.427 --> 56:41.988
<i>And now we go out to Hartman Hughes,</i>
<i>who's enjoying some fresh air.</i>

56:42.097 --> 56:44.531
Hartman, not getting too wet, are you?

56:44.633 --> 56:49.593
Paula, the only thing keeping me
from falling into the bottomless depths...

56:49.705 --> 56:52.230
of these shark-infested waters...

56:52.341 --> 56:54.673
is this flimsy two-by-four railing.

56:54.777 --> 56:58.508
<i>And the Galvestonians here</i>
<i>are hoping that this storm...</i>

56:58.614 --> 57:02.243
will not surpass the storm of 1900...

57:02.351 --> 57:05.650
when 6,000 people lost their lives-

57:05.754 --> 57:09.485
nuns, orphans washed out to sea.

57:10.526 --> 57:14.155
This is Hartman Hughes in Galveston...

57:14.263 --> 57:18.290
in the middle of a mild storm...

57:18.400 --> 57:20.300
<i>reporting from the edge.</i>

57:21.570 --> 57:24.937
All right. Good work.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.940
- Good job.
- Happy to help!

57:28.444 --> 57:31.777
- Holy shit! There's Mary!
- Where?

57:33.882 --> 57:38.285
- You know, you're an asshole!
- Hmm!

57:38.454 --> 57:40.752
You know what? I love dressing up. I do.

57:40.856 --> 57:43.484
But, guys, those panties
are short on sparkle.

57:43.592 --> 57:45.719
Thank the good Lord for the BeDazzler.

57:48.397 --> 57:52.493
Guys? Hold on!

57:52.601 --> 57:54.535
- Oh, crap!
- Oh, God!

57:57.840 --> 57:59.637
<i>- Okay, reverse! Reverse!</i>

57:59.741 --> 58:01.675
The car won't start! Reverse doesn't work!

58:01.777 --> 58:03.404
- Oh, my God!
- Put it in drive!

58:03.512 --> 58:06.310
- I can't! It's stalled!
- Okay. Oh, God!

58:06.415 --> 58:09.976
<i>It will not start.
What are we gonna do?</i>

58:10.085 --> 58:11.552
Okay, okay. Uh- Uh-

58:11.653 --> 58:13.245
<i>- Crap!</i>
<i>- Storm drain!</i>

58:13.355 --> 58:16.085
- Okay. Okay.
- Get out!

58:16.191 --> 58:17.818
Guys, come on!

58:17.926 --> 58:19.826
- My shoe!
- Give me your hand!

58:19.928 --> 58:22.522
Ow, ow, ow!

58:27.803 --> 58:30.567
Come on! Keep running!

58:30.672 --> 58:32.333
- Come on!
- We have to hurry!

58:33.976 --> 58:37.571
Everybody get in!
Get in and go all the way down! Hurry!

58:37.679 --> 58:38.976
It's blocked!

58:39.081 --> 58:41.606
We're gonna be okay though.
We're gonna be fine.

58:41.717 --> 58:43.446
Yea! Ponchos!

58:43.552 --> 58:47.181
<i>Yes. No such thing as too prepared</i>
<i>for adversity, my friends.</i>

58:47.289 --> 58:49.052
Oh!

58:49.157 --> 58:51.250
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.191
<i>- Oh.</i>

58:53.295 --> 58:55.957
Oh. Oh! Oh!

58:56.064 --> 58:58.726
Insecta Hemiptera
of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha!

58:58.834 --> 59:00.233
Cicada.

59:00.335 --> 59:02.701
This species only comes
around every 17 years!

59:02.804 --> 59:06.103
<i>Add these very, very smart</i>
<i>cicadas to a tornado...</i>

59:06.208 --> 59:09.405
it's like a once-in-a-lifetime
natural miracle!

59:09.511 --> 59:12.639
- Do you know how lucky we are?
- Cool.

59:20.022 --> 59:22.217
Shit!

59:24.560 --> 59:26.152
<i>Curse words.</i>

59:26.261 --> 59:29.230
<i>Swearing, profanity,
expletives-a good old cuss.</i>

59:29.331 --> 59:31.891
<i>Maybe these words aren't</i>
<i>such a good idea in some places...</i>

59:32.000 --> 59:34.468
<i>such as crosswords or kindergarten...</i>

59:34.570 --> 59:38.233
<i>but when amongst friends
and in a sewer...</i>

59:38.340 --> 59:40.672
<i>it's perfectly acceptable</i>
<i>to have a mouth like one.</i>

59:49.451 --> 59:52.909
My car.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.763
- Storm's over. What else is happening?
- All quiet.

01:00:06.868 --> 01:00:08.995
Hey, Chris, any celebrities
arrested for drunk driving today?

01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:11.504
Give me the phone.

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:14.701
Angus, how in the hell
do you miss a "tornadocane"?

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:18.439
- Please, give us another chance.
- If you keep this up, you're leaving me no choice.

01:00:18.547 --> 01:00:19.115
Please, sir, I-

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.311
Get me downed street signs,
damaged boats, drowned puppies-

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:22.747
whatever.

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:25.479
And then I want you all in my office
Tuesday morning at 9:00.

01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:27.179
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, I-

01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:29.189
They're through, all of them. Finished.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:34.729
Find out if Vasquez is happy at NNC.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.458
We need to go shoot some B-roll
of the storm damage.

01:00:37.566 --> 01:00:39.261
I'm not scared of love.

01:00:39.368 --> 01:00:41.632
I went on one date with her, Mom.
I went on one date with her.

01:00:41.737 --> 01:00:44.763
<i>B- roll?</i>

01:00:44.873 --> 01:00:47.671
A complete waste of my handsome gifts.

01:00:47.776 --> 01:00:50.040
Where's a decent tragedy
when you need one, huh?

01:01:03.725 --> 01:01:07.525
<i>Who wants to go forward?</i>
<i>Who wants to go backward?</i>

01:01:07.629 --> 01:01:10.223
Hey, kids. Who's ready for some fun?

01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:29.577
No!

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.619
You can knit this handy purse.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.881
- But my favorite project-
- Sorry. We're gonna have to interrupt.

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:36.856
Breaking news from Silver Plume, Colorado.

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:40.917
A group of hearing-impaired children
have plummeted into an abandoned mine shaft.

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.725
Yeah, I just heard.
Who are we sending to cover it?

01:01:43.832 --> 01:01:46.266
What?

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:48.928
<i>...blissfully unaware of what lay ahead.</i>
- Is there no one else?

01:01:49.037 --> 01:01:51.471
<i>There's no word yet
on injuries, John...</i>

01:01:51.573 --> 01:01:54.770
<i>but we are getting reports</i>
<i>that a crane is on its way to the scene...</i>

01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:57.538
<i>to try and rescue those
poor deaf children...</i>

01:01:57.646 --> 01:01:59.637
<i>before the ground
collapses on top of them.</i>

01:01:59.748 --> 01:02:02.216
<i>- Judy, John, back to you.</i>
- Now that's a great story.

01:02:02.317 --> 01:02:04.877
Angus, where'd you get those?

01:02:04.986 --> 01:02:08.422
- Hmm?
- Mary could have planted those.

01:02:08.523 --> 01:02:11.856
- Think she poisoned our chips?
- Well, can you prove that she didn't?

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.428
Huh? Did you buy them? I didn't buy them.

01:02:14.529 --> 01:02:17.089
Did you buy-
You don't buy anything. Did you buy them?

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:20.100
<i>You know, poisoning is the number
one murder method for crazy women.</i>

01:02:20.202 --> 01:02:22.102
Are you kidding me?

01:02:22.204 --> 01:02:24.069
- Nope.
- Hey!

01:02:24.172 --> 01:02:27.801
Everything's gotta go out.
We gotta flush it. We gotta flush it, guys.

01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:30.173
Give a hoot. Don't pollute.

01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:38.485
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:43.282
You know, my old man was
a combat journalist in 'Nam.

01:02:43.391 --> 01:02:45.689
<i>Hard to fill those boots, huh?</i>

01:02:45.794 --> 01:02:48.854
Got killed before I ever had a chance
to say good-bye to him.

01:02:50.332 --> 01:02:52.459
Yeah, if I ever get that anchor desk...

01:02:52.567 --> 01:02:55.035
he's gonna be really proud of me in heaven.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:58.197
Well, looks like we found
the eye of the storm, guys.

01:02:58.306 --> 01:03:01.605
Holy shit. There's Mary.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.610
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, come on!</i>

01:03:03.712 --> 01:03:05.839
Oh, my God. It's Steve. Steve.

01:03:05.947 --> 01:03:08.541
Steve.

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:11.380
- What are you doing? What?
- Getting some air.

01:03:11.486 --> 01:03:13.044
<i>What are you writing?</i>
<i>You're not telling her where we're going?</i>

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:15.055
I'm making some notes! Leave me alone!

01:03:16.003 --> 01:03:16.988
- Stop it!
- No way!

01:03:17.092 --> 01:03:20.528
Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve!

01:03:20.629 --> 01:03:23.223
Oh, Jesus! She's got a machete!
Where the hell did she get a machete?

01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:25.799
<i>Oh, man!
She's gonna pluck my eyes out, man!</i>

01:03:25.901 --> 01:03:28.734
<i>She is gonna carve my eyes out</i>
<i>and she's gonna make me eat them!</i>

01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:30.998
<i>I swear to God.</i>
<i>I've read about it on the Internet, man!</i>

01:03:31.106 --> 01:03:33.506
Oh, my God! She's gonna cut my feet off!

01:03:33.608 --> 01:03:36.076
I'm not gonna be able to walk!
She's gonna make me eat my legs!

01:03:36.178 --> 01:03:38.009
She's gonna make you eat your legs?

01:03:38.113 --> 01:03:40.172
- Yeah, I read about it!
- Oh, really?

01:03:40.282 --> 01:03:42.250
What, some sort of pimento leg loaf?

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:45.183
Hey! You think this is funny? I've read up on this!

01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:48.723
<i>- I know it's not the same thing as-</i>
- Just shut up. Just shut up.

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:50.792
Just shut up! Just shut the heck up!

01:03:50.892 --> 01:03:53.417
- I swear to-
- Shut up! All right?

01:03:55.163 --> 01:03:57.688
Jesus! Where do I begin?

01:03:57.799 --> 01:04:01.929
Hartman, for the love of God, stop tanning.

01:04:02.037 --> 01:04:03.595
You look like a Cheese Nip!

01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:06.367
<i>You look like an orange with lips!</i>

01:04:06.474 --> 01:04:08.908
You look like a wrinkled peach!

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:13.003
And you! Geraldo! Lose the wig!

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:15.378
You look like a retired porn star.

01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:19.214
<i>Who you fooling?</i>
<i>Oh, that's a great disguise, Einstein.</i>

01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:21.653
The van's the same, dumb-ass!

01:04:23.825 --> 01:04:27.693
Mary is not a psycho.
<i>You're</i> the psycho.

01:04:27.796 --> 01:04:29.696
She's just a smart girl with red boots.

01:04:39.541 --> 01:04:41.975
<i>That's good work, Angus.</i>

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:44.637
<i>I knew you had some
balls in those Underoos.</i>

01:04:47.215 --> 01:04:49.115
Okay. Ooh. Okay.

01:04:49.217 --> 01:04:51.048
"Deaf kids in a mine. Silver Plume.

"Meat."

01:05:01.663 --> 01:05:05.292
"Please meat"- M-E-A-T.

<i>"Please meat me there. XO, Steve."</i>

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:14.797
See? He needs me,
if only to help with his spelling.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:23.440
You know what one of my favorite ingredients
of crosswording is? Perseverance.

01:05:23.551 --> 01:05:25.746
If you quit a puzzle, you can't finish it.

01:05:27.255 --> 01:05:29.155
Sure, every once in a while,
you run into a doozy...

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:31.623
that you don't think you could ever solve
in a million years...

01:05:31.726 --> 01:05:34.024
but if you stick with it, you figure it out.

01:05:38.566 --> 01:05:40.033
Eventually.

01:05:43.471 --> 01:05:46.304
Worst thing you can do
is leave it unfinished.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:51.178
It's never the solution, is it?

01:05:51.279 --> 01:05:54.976
You know what my favorite part of a crossword is?

01:05:57.052 --> 01:06:00.044
When you realize you know something
you didn't think you knew.

01:06:01.323 --> 01:06:03.291
Maybe.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.185
To Colorado then?

01:06:07.295 --> 01:06:12.096
<i>- # You got all the sugar#</i>
- Yea!

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.828

Hey, people, back it up!

01:06:19.607 --> 01:06:22.872

<i>Here we go, guys.
Start lowering him down.</i>

01:06:29.818 --> 01:06:31.718
Vasquez.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.584
Hey, what's he doing with his hands?

01:06:38.193 --> 01:06:40.093
Son of a bitch.

01:06:40.195 --> 01:06:43.528
I haven't had my big moment yet,
so I gotta find something.

01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:45.394
They're all okay!

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:50.967
All right, on three.

01:06:51.072 --> 01:06:53.097
Three, two, one.

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:55.904
Elation here in Colorado...

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:59.344
and yet danger lurking at every corner...

01:06:59.447 --> 01:07:03.907
as rescuers bring the "besmudged"
little cherubs up one at a time.

01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:08.589
Thank God they're all right.

01:07:10.191 --> 01:07:12.250
Thank you, God.

- Oh!
<i>- The ground seems to be collapsing.</i>

01:07:46.294 --> 01:07:48.626
<i>The heavy crane is actually shaking.</i>
<i>Oh, this is terrible.</i>

01:08:01.376 --> 01:08:04.243
<i>Yes, it's dangerous there.</i>

01:08:04.946 --> 01:08:06.413
<i>What happened?</i>

01:08:06.848 --> 01:08:08.048
<i>I don't know...</i>

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:10.517
<i>I don't know...</i>
<i>but I smell a lawsuit.</i>

<i>A happy ending, and yet parents</i>
<i>around the country wondering...</i>

"Is my family in danger

<i>Is my backyard an abandoned mine?"</i>

<i>Danger's passed!</i>

<i>Thank God they're all safe.</i>

01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:27.492
<i>Is that him?</i>

01:08:27.602 --> 01:08:30.298
Yeah.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:39.307
Well.
"Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning."

01:08:39.413 --> 01:08:41.381
Shakespeare.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:52.184
And I say to these complete strangers-

01:08:57.131 --> 01:09:00.067
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.470
...one that has left parents
across this country wondering...

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.344
"How do I keep my family safe

- Mary's in the hole.
- Don't be ridiculous.

<i>Somebody else went in!</i>

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.661
<i>Cut! Get over there!</i>

<i>Come on, handheld.
Come on, let's go!</i>

01:09:41.376 --> 01:09:43.207
Did somebody fall in the mine?

01:09:46.281 --> 01:09:49.341
Tell her help is on the way.
We're working on getting a new crane.

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:51.782
We just need her to confirm she's conscious.

01:09:51.886 --> 01:09:53.854
Here. Give me that.

01:09:53.955 --> 01:09:55.855
<i>All rescue personnel on scene...</i>

01:09:55.957 --> 01:09:59.358
<i>apparently we have another victim</i>
<i>who has gone into the hole at the mine.</i>

01:10:15.343 --> 01:10:17.971
Okay, I am not afraid.

01:10:18.079 --> 01:10:22.448
I'm not afraid, nor am I affrightened.

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:24.450
Okay.

01:10:30.358 --> 01:10:32.258
Uh-

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.260
Hello!

01:10:34.362 --> 01:10:36.762
It is me, Mary Horowitz.

01:10:36.864 --> 01:10:40.095
Yes, I seem to have fallen into the mine.

01:10:40.201 --> 01:10:43.034
Hello? Everyone?

01:10:43.137 --> 01:10:46.732
It's, uh, me, Mary Horowitz. Hello?

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:49.605
People, please move back.

01:10:49.711 --> 01:10:52.271
<i>- Back up! Back it up.</i>
<i>- This ground is unstable.</i>

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:56.476
So she just dove in
that hole, like a gopher.

01:10:56.584 --> 01:10:59.849
No, dude, not like a gopher.
Like a human being.

01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:02.081
She was running after me,
and she fell in the hole.

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.317
<i> That's the way to get</i>
<i>your heads out of your asses.</i>

01:11:04.425 --> 01:11:07.258
That shot of Steve's girlfriend
falling into the pit is priceless.

01:11:07.362 --> 01:11:10.263
We've got the inside advantage here,
so let's use it.

01:11:10.365 --> 01:11:12.663
Get Steve ready to go on
and talk about his girlfriend...

01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:14.997
as soon as we get the graphics together.

01:11:15.103 --> 01:11:17.765
Fifteen minutes.

01:11:17.872 --> 01:11:20.136
- Here he comes!
- You people are ruining the ferns!

01:11:20.241 --> 01:11:23.904
Can you comment on the rumors that Mary's
fall into the mine was a suicide attempt?

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:27.345
Well-That's ridiculous. Not our Mary.

01:11:27.448 --> 01:11:31.885
The word "depression"
is not in her vocabulary.

01:11:31.986 --> 01:11:35.387
All right, obviously
it is in her vocabulary.

01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:37.390
But no. No.

01:11:37.492 --> 01:11:39.892
She-She never lets anything get her down.

01:11:39.994 --> 01:11:42.656
Still living at home at her age-
clearly not a normal situation.

01:11:42.764 --> 01:11:44.129
Not normal?

01:11:44.232 --> 01:11:45.790
We-We love having her here.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.492
<i>Sir, I'd like to ask
another question.</i>

01:11:47.602 --> 01:11:49.900
- Yes. Yes, we love having her here.
- Yes, we do.

01:11:50.004 --> 01:11:51.995
Fumigation can't be rushed.

01:11:53.908 --> 01:11:56.342
One more question!

01:11:56.444 --> 01:11:58.742
Now, I don't wanna speculate here...

01:11:58.846 --> 01:12:00.871
<i>- but if the ground did collapse...</i>
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:12:00.982 --> 01:12:02.882
<i>could that not result in death...</i>

01:12:02.984 --> 01:12:06.852
<i>or, at the absolute least,</i>
<i>horrible disfigurement?</i>

01:12:06.954 --> 01:12:11.220
I don't wanna speculate either,
but, yes, absolutely, it could.

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:13.988
And as we await the tragic
fate of Mary Horowitz...

01:12:14.095 --> 01:12:17.861
attention now on the boots she was wearing
when she slipped into the mine...

01:12:17.965 --> 01:12:21.093
a story I couldn't tell
until I'd walked a mile in Mary's shoes.

01:12:21.202 --> 01:12:22.669
Take a look.

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:27.730
It's hour one, and it's as if
my feet have been placed in vise grips.

01:12:29.377 --> 01:12:33.074
We're at the two-hour mark,
and, actually, right now I feel pretty-

01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:35.945
Oh!

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:39.213
<i>Light source.</i>

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.346
<i>"A nd God said, 'L et there be...</i>

01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:45.916
light."'

01:12:53.267 --> 01:12:55.997
Oh. Voilà. Yes.

01:12:56.104 --> 01:12:58.072
Yes, it's perfect. Yes. This is per-

01:13:00.408 --> 01:13:02.433
Ah! Oh!

01:13:02.543 --> 01:13:06.070
<i>Oh, my God. They forgot one.</i>

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.273
You scared the crap out of me.

01:13:10.318 --> 01:13:13.515
Hi. I'm-I'm sorry.

01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:16.146
Uh, can you, uh-

01:13:16.257 --> 01:13:20.091
Can you- Can you hear me? I mean, at all?

01:13:21.195 --> 01:13:23.254
Do you have sensory-neural hearing loss...

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:25.332
or do you have conductive?

01:13:25.433 --> 01:13:28.425
Because if-if it-

01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:30.436
She doesn't hear me. Okay.

01:13:30.538 --> 01:13:32.631
You know, I understand
a little bit of sign language...

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.300
so if you wanna-you know? No? Okay.

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:38.504
Um, " Deaf people can do anything
except for hear."

01:13:38.613 --> 01:13:40.410
Do you know who said that?

01:13:40.515 --> 01:13:44.076
Dr. Jordan-
first deaf president at Gallaudet U.

01:13:44.185 --> 01:13:47.586
Yeah. Maybe you'll go there one day.

01:13:47.688 --> 01:13:49.986
If we both don't perish in here.

01:13:51.726 --> 01:13:54.490
Hold on. I'll be right back.
You stay here, okay? Okay? Right.

01:13:57.198 --> 01:14:00.861
<i>Well, Paula, apparently they're gonna</i>
<i>keep it old-school and simple-</i>

01:14:00.968 --> 01:14:03.129
a piece of paper, a number two pencil.

01:14:03.237 --> 01:14:05.728
This is Hartman Hughes
reporting from the edge.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.637
Cut. Corbitt wants you on next.

01:14:07.742 --> 01:14:09.972
I told you I am not her boyfriend, Angus.

01:14:10.077 --> 01:14:12.841
Yeah, but you're the one that encouraged her
to come here to begin with.

01:14:12.947 --> 01:14:15.070
You're the one that asked her
to come here, not me!

01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:15.438
Guys! Guys!

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:18.451
NNC has got their hands
on everything but her panty size.

01:14:18.553 --> 01:14:20.020
- What?
- Our Mary?

01:14:20.121 --> 01:14:23.750
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch. Vasquez scooped <i>us?</i>

01:14:27.728 --> 01:14:30.060
Behold, notice of our imminent rescue.

01:14:30.164 --> 01:14:32.655
Oh, okay. Okay.

01:14:32.767 --> 01:14:35.565
This is good news. This is good news, okay?

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:38.332
They're going to tell
us something wonderful.

01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:42.398
And it says, "Mary, are you"-

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.478
Oh.

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.385
That's a good sign right there.

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.717
Oh, God!

01:14:57.859 --> 01:15:00.623
What's it say, son?

01:15:00.728 --> 01:15:02.628
Millions of people are watching.

01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:04.220
Um, okay.

01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:07.267
"I think you mean, am I conscious?
Not, am I conscience?

01:15:09.804 --> 01:15:12.602
<i>"'Conscious' means alert and awake.</i>

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:15.073
"'Conscience' is your
inner morality gauge...

01:15:15.176 --> 01:15:17.974
"you know, the thing
that stops you from doing bad things...

01:15:18.079 --> 01:15:22.072
e.g., killing, stealing,
harming helpless animals and whatnot."

01:15:22.183 --> 01:15:24.344
Can we leave her down there?

01:15:24.452 --> 01:15:27.353
"To answer your question,
yes, I am conscious.

01:15:27.455 --> 01:15:30.618
" My leg is bleeding, though I'll probably live.

01:15:30.725 --> 01:15:33.888
- Yours truly, Mary Horowitz."
- Yes!

01:15:33.995 --> 01:15:36.122
"P.S. Did anyone lose a little deaf girl?

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:40.291
I found one. She's fine,
other than not being able to hear, I mean."

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:45.598
They missed a child?
Can't these people count?

01:15:45.706 --> 01:15:47.765
Thank God for this woman Mary Horowitz.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:50.400
Let's bring up that picture of her again.

01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:52.411
Yesterday, Mary Horowitz.

01:15:52.513 --> 01:15:55.607
Today, Mary Horowitz- hero.

01:15:55.716 --> 01:15:57.707
<i>- This just in-</i>
- I'm coming to save you!

01:15:57.818 --> 01:16:00.912
speculation as to whether or not Mary
intentionally heaved herself into the mine...

01:16:01.022 --> 01:16:03.047
to save the poor deaf child...

01:16:03.157 --> 01:16:06.854
after rescuers ignored her
desperate, desperate pleas.

01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:09.058
<i>Paula, I'm here with Steve Muller.</i>

01:16:09.163 --> 01:16:11.654
Steve's girlfriend, Mary Horowitz...

01:16:11.766 --> 01:16:15.224
struggling for her life
down in the abandoned mine, as we speak.

01:16:15.336 --> 01:16:18.931
She's not my girlfriend, and I'm not
gonna say that just to get ratings. Okay?

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.474
Yeah, and the truth is
I don't really even wanna do this.

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:24.841
<i>Mary Horowitz,</i>
<i>described as "freakishly intelligent."</i>

01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:28.211
These words also described
Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.

01:16:28.316 --> 01:16:31.479
However, you never know about these people.
They're clean-cut-

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:34.384
But people deserve to
know the truth about her.

01:16:37.091 --> 01:16:40.117
I mean, she sees things
that other people don't.

01:16:40.227 --> 01:16:44.357
And she's kind, and-
and I think she means well...

01:16:44.465 --> 01:16:48.959
even though, when she does things,
they're just a little unusual.

01:16:50.304 --> 01:16:52.363
And she's smart. She's super smart.

01:16:52.473 --> 01:16:55.237
And not in a freakish way. In-

01:16:55.343 --> 01:16:58.710
Like, she has a gift.
I mean, she knows everything...

01:16:58.813 --> 01:17:03.375
everything but whom not to trust
and how not to get hurt and-

01:17:05.453 --> 01:17:07.421
and how to survive us.

01:17:10.891 --> 01:17:13.018
And she doesn't pretend to be
somebody that she's not.

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:19.191
And she certainly doesn't
deserve to be where she is now.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.995
<i>Maybe if I just do this, I can-</i>

01:17:21.102 --> 01:17:23.696
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

01:17:28.843 --> 01:17:31.710
Yeah. The tracks down there just-

01:17:31.812 --> 01:17:33.803
just keep going and going down and-

01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:38.442
If we just concentrate on this
and that and that, then we'll-

01:17:38.552 --> 01:17:40.452
But not to- not to worry.

01:17:40.554 --> 01:17:43.148
I'll- I'll get us out of here.

01:17:44.592 --> 01:17:46.958
Hope that crane gets here soon.

01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:49.655
I hope so too.

01:17:49.764 --> 01:17:51.664
'Cause if there's carbon
monoxide down there-

01:17:51.766 --> 01:17:53.666
But the air's coming through the top.

01:17:53.768 --> 01:17:57.397
Even at concentrations of five ppm,
they could suffocate.

01:18:04.779 --> 01:18:07.509
I am so sorry.

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:16.214
She has stolen a little piece of my heart.

01:18:16.323 --> 01:18:20.589
<i>- What'd the site engineer say?</i>
- The stress fractures are worsening by the minute.

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:23.562
The longer they're down there,
the greater the chance of collapse.

01:18:23.664 --> 01:18:25.188
They thought the air quality was bad...

01:18:25.299 --> 01:18:27.233
try a 50-foot span of rock and earth
dropping down there.

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:28.801
Oh, Jesus.

01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:31.736
That's a bunch of horseshit.
She's gonna be fine.

01:18:31.839 --> 01:18:34.205
Odds are she won't. We gotta go on.

01:18:34.308 --> 01:18:36.674
What are we gonna say?
Say she's not gonna make it?

01:18:36.777 --> 01:18:38.938
Her whole family is watching, Angus. Christ.

01:18:39.046 --> 01:18:41.344
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Hughes.

01:18:41.449 --> 01:18:43.349
All right, two minutes. That's it.

01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:46.011
Some blind date, huh?

01:18:48.255 --> 01:18:50.155
Here's a candle.

01:18:52.059 --> 01:18:54.027
Hi, Winston.

01:18:56.664 --> 01:19:01.101
I think I'll feel better if I pretend
that it's Mary's surprise party.

01:19:05.005 --> 01:19:09.499
I'm making an apple head for Mary
for when she gets out.

01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:13.512
- And she's gonna get out.
<i>- # And I don't know #</i>

01:19:13.614 --> 01:19:19.280
<i># Why life, it seems to be #</i>

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:26.785
<i>- This one's gonna work.</i>
<i>- # So hard for dreamers #</i>

01:19:26.894 --> 01:19:29.863
<i># Like you and me #</i>

01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:33.798
<i> Rescuers are desperate</i>
<i>for the crane to reach them within the hour.</i>

01:19:33.901 --> 01:19:36.961
Helicopters are out of the
question because of all the power lines.

01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:39.164
Hope is fading fast.

01:19:39.273 --> 01:19:42.936
The earth tremors are
getting stronger. They have to get out soon.

01:19:43.043 --> 01:19:48.982
<i># Is everywhere ##</i>

01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:51.779
The other side. Oh!

01:19:51.886 --> 01:19:54.377
Ouch too.

01:20:01.996 --> 01:20:06.490
I can't do this. I can't get us out of here.

01:20:10.004 --> 01:20:12.234
Guess what.

01:20:12.339 --> 01:20:15.502
Mary Horowitz doesn't have the answers.

01:20:15.609 --> 01:20:17.907
Or a job.

01:20:21.015 --> 01:20:23.848
And-And my job mattered!

01:20:26.921 --> 01:20:30.118
I was the <i>Sacramento Herald's</i>
crossword constructor...

01:20:30.224 --> 01:20:33.284
and I threw it all away- for what?

01:20:38.165 --> 01:20:41.862
"Mary, Steve wants you to come be with us.
He needs you."

01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:45.063
Really? Methinks the media lies.

01:20:45.172 --> 01:20:48.005
A little.

01:20:48.108 --> 01:20:50.668
Words, people. Words.

01:20:52.046 --> 01:20:55.573
There are meaningful words,
there are pointless words...

01:20:55.683 --> 01:20:58.743
and then there are words that hurt.

01:21:02.556 --> 01:21:06.083
"Mary, why can't you be
like every other girl?"

01:21:06.193 --> 01:21:10.186
<i>"Mary, where do you get</i>
<i>all that useless information?"</i>

01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:12.424
"Mary, why do you talk like that?"

01:21:12.533 --> 01:21:15.195
<i>"Mary, Mary!"
You know, it's just-just-</i>

01:21:15.302 --> 01:21:17.327
Oh, oh! Oh! Oh!

01:21:17.438 --> 01:21:20.100
And the pièce de résistance, yes.

01:21:20.207 --> 01:21:24.439
"Mary, why do you wear
those stupid red boots all the time?"

01:21:24.545 --> 01:21:26.638
You wanna know why? Huh?

01:21:26.747 --> 01:21:28.908
Do you wanna know why?
Okay, I will tell you why.

01:21:29.016 --> 01:21:32.508
<i>I wear them because they
make my toes feel...</i>

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:36.249
like 10 friends on a camping trip.

01:21:36.357 --> 01:21:38.257
That's why I wear them.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.855
We're finished.

01:21:45.966 --> 01:21:48.935
The ground is gonna collapse.
We're gonna perish.

01:21:49.036 --> 01:21:51.004
I just wanna go home.

01:21:55.843 --> 01:21:57.743
Sorry.

01:22:02.483 --> 01:22:06.715
<i>"I don't know what you're saying,</i>
<i>but you talk too much. "</i>

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:10.984
I know.

01:22:13.294 --> 01:22:15.194
I know.

01:22:30.544 --> 01:22:33.570
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to step back.

01:22:33.681 --> 01:22:36.241
<i>- Hughes!</i>
- Not now.

01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:38.443
<i>You wrote the note
telling Mary to come here.</i>

01:22:40.354 --> 01:22:43.517
You brought her here. And if she dies-

01:22:49.797 --> 01:22:52.459
This is just a fence.

01:22:52.566 --> 01:22:55.057
Being on that side of it
doesn't make you any better.

01:23:01.742 --> 01:23:04.006
You did that.

01:23:04.111 --> 01:23:06.375
...cheated on her taxes-
...and the red boots-

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.005
<i>Does she think herself
some kind of superhero?</i>

01:23:09.116 --> 01:23:11.209
Mary-

01:23:13.087 --> 01:23:14.884
she did this.

01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:14.975
He was my ticket to normal.

01:24:16.083 --> 01:24:17.380
Yeah.

01:24:17.484 --> 01:24:20.647
"Why would you want to be normal?"

01:24:23.757 --> 01:24:27.488
I don't. I don't.

01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:31.129
These will keep you warm.

01:24:32.699 --> 01:24:34.599
Yeah.

01:24:34.701 --> 01:24:40.435
"Maybe someone will
figure out how to save us."

01:24:44.578 --> 01:24:47.274
Maybe. Maybe.

01:24:52.786 --> 01:24:54.686
Say that again.

01:24:56.223 --> 01:24:58.123
"Maybe someone"-

01:25:02.763 --> 01:25:06.426
"Maybe." "Maybe."

01:25:10.771 --> 01:25:14.764
Little deaf girl,
it's time for us to go home.

01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:18.778
Why aren't they doing anything?

01:25:20.981 --> 01:25:23.609
How much- How much do you weigh?

01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:29.549
Fifty pounds, give or take? Okay.

01:25:30.557 --> 01:25:32.616
See.

01:25:34.561 --> 01:25:37.052
Okay, just get it right down here.

01:25:37.164 --> 01:25:39.132
Just get all over the joints.

01:25:39.233 --> 01:25:41.133
When I got kicked out of Girl Scouts...

01:25:41.235 --> 01:25:43.430
and all the other girls were
learning how to sell cookies...

01:25:43.537 --> 01:25:47.837
I was at home- ow- reading physics books.

01:25:47.941 --> 01:25:50.842
Voilà.

01:25:50.944 --> 01:25:54.038
<i>Hartman.</i>
<i>What are you doing? I told you two minutes.</i>

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:56.480
It's my fault Mary's in the hole.

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:58.312
But like Patton said...

01:25:58.418 --> 01:26:01.649
"A bad plan violently executed today...

01:26:01.755 --> 01:26:04.223
is better than a great plan tomorrow."

01:26:09.296 --> 01:26:11.526
So, I'm gonna pull the lever,
push the cart...

01:26:11.632 --> 01:26:13.998
and up we go, okay?

01:26:16.537 --> 01:26:19.335
I'm coming, Mary Horowitz! I'm coming!

01:26:19.439 --> 01:26:22.602
I'm coming to save you!

01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:25.269
What the-

01:26:26.446 --> 01:26:28.471
One, two-

01:26:35.556 --> 01:26:39.287
Oh! Okay! Pretty good drop.

01:26:39.393 --> 01:26:41.361
You guys doing all right?

01:26:41.461 --> 01:26:45.295
Mm-hmm. But we were just on-on, you know-

01:26:45.399 --> 01:26:47.890
Something just touched me! Something bit me!

01:26:48.001 --> 01:26:51.960
Something- Help!

01:26:52.072 --> 01:26:54.097
There's something in that water.

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:57.609
Something ni-nibbled at my leg.

01:26:57.711 --> 01:27:02.045
Hartman Hughes just jumped-
I repeat, jumped into the mine.

01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:04.777
<i> Grabbing on to a hose</i>
<i>that was attached to nothing...</i>

01:27:04.885 --> 01:27:07.752
he literally dove right into the mine.

01:27:07.854 --> 01:27:10.220
All eyes now not only on Mary Horowitz...

01:27:10.324 --> 01:27:13.657
but also CCN reporter Hartman Hughes.

01:27:15.195 --> 01:27:17.595
Why the hell didn't I think of that?

01:27:17.698 --> 01:27:21.964
Did you check the perimeter for spiders?

01:27:22.069 --> 01:27:23.969
Uh, yes. Yes, I did.

01:27:25.272 --> 01:27:28.799
It's really... scary down here.

01:27:32.512 --> 01:27:35.538
You know, if my old man could see me now.

01:27:39.086 --> 01:27:41.919
I'm sorry.

01:27:42.022 --> 01:27:45.185
I mean, I got you into this.

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:47.487
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:27:47.594 --> 01:27:49.494
Thanks.

01:27:54.635 --> 01:27:58.571
Um, how much do you weigh?

01:27:59.706 --> 01:28:03.039
<i>And as this pulls back
and pulls us upwards...</i>

01:28:03.143 --> 01:28:07.477
I'll be cradling her here,
and I'll be cradling you here.

01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:12.951
Maybe you-you would like
to be holding us like this when we go up.

01:28:13.053 --> 01:28:16.784
No, no. It's your plan,
and I don't wanna take the credit.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:23.120
- I'd like to take the credit.
- Okay. All right.

01:28:24.246 --> 01:28:27.098
I don't know. He said something
about Patton and a bad plan.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.361
- Did you see the cable just move?
<i>- Please do not jump into the mine!</i>

01:28:29.469 --> 01:28:31.164
Get the camera right now.

01:28:31.271 --> 01:28:32.966
We- Steve!

01:28:33.073 --> 01:28:35.041
<i>You! Sir!</i>

01:28:35.142 --> 01:28:37.440
That cable's moving. Looks like they're coming up.
Is there anything I can do to help out?

01:28:37.544 --> 01:28:40.513
- We're doing everything we can.
- I know, but can it take all that weight?

01:28:43.016 --> 01:28:44.847
<i>- Foot in the stirrup?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:46.009
- Okay.
- All set.

01:28:46.119 --> 01:28:47.882
- All right.
- Okay.

01:28:50.157 --> 01:28:52.250
- You ready?
- Are you ready?

01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:55.089
- Yeah. I just hope this works.
- Yeah, you and me.

01:28:55.195 --> 01:28:57.459
- Hold on.
- What's up?

01:28:57.564 --> 01:29:00.795
Oh. Thank you. Appreciate that.

01:29:00.901 --> 01:29:03.028
Thank you. I'm camera-ready.

01:29:03.136 --> 01:29:04.728
Okay. All right.

01:29:04.838 --> 01:29:06.362
Okay.

01:29:06.473 --> 01:29:09.533
Three, two, one.

01:29:14.781 --> 01:29:16.544
<i>If life is like a crossword puzzle...</i>

01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:20.108

01:29:22.856 --> 01:29:24.721
<i>Is it solvable?</i>

01:29:24.825 --> 01:29:26.725
The crane is beginning to tilt over.

01:29:26.827 --> 01:29:28.795
I think they're coming up!
It's hard to tell what's going on.

01:29:28.895 --> 01:29:31.227
<i>Is it entertaining?</i>

01:29:37.404 --> 01:29:39.429
<i>Does it sparkle?</i>

01:29:39.539 --> 01:29:41.268
<i>- There they are!</i>

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:45.402

<i>The crowd is going crazy! This is incredible!</i>

01:29:45.512 --> 01:29:47.742
- Oh, my God! Mary!
- Oh, my God!

01:29:47.848 --> 01:29:49.975
It's her!

01:29:51.418 --> 01:29:53.443
Whoo!

01:29:58.859 --> 01:30:01.555
- They're safe!
- Ah!

01:30:03.897 --> 01:30:07.128

Hartman Hughes!

01:30:28.622 --> 01:30:30.783
<i>There's Hartman Hughes.</i>

01:30:30.891 --> 01:30:34.520
<i>Hartman, Mary Horowitz
and the deaf child.</i>

01:30:34.628 --> 01:30:36.528
Everything feels so wonderful.

01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:38.598
Looks like we're gonna have to
give her her job back.

01:30:38.698 --> 01:30:40.791
Our own Hartman Hughes
becoming the hero of this story...

01:30:40.901 --> 01:30:43.529
risking his own life
to save the life of Mary Horowitz...

01:30:43.637 --> 01:30:45.434
and an unidentified little girl.

01:30:45.539 --> 01:30:47.234
<i>Truly, folks, this is unbelievable.</i>

01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:49.604
I'm gonna have to make that idiot anchor.

01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:52.200
There you go. You okay?

01:30:52.312 --> 01:30:54.109
<i>Mary, what are you wearing?</i>

01:30:54.214 --> 01:30:57.274
<i>- Um, I'm-I'm gonna go.</i>
- Okay.

01:30:57.384 --> 01:30:59.443
- Thanks, Mary.
- You're welcome.

01:30:59.553 --> 01:31:01.714
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:31:02.522 --> 01:31:04.717
- Have a nice life.
- Okay.

01:31:04.825 --> 01:31:06.725
<i> How did you know</i>
<i>there was another child trapped?</i>

01:31:06.827 --> 01:31:08.692
<i>Mary, what happened to your boots?</i>

01:31:08.795 --> 01:31:10.956
<i>Are you a true blonde?</i>

01:31:11.064 --> 01:31:13.555
- Mary. Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

01:31:13.667 --> 01:31:15.362
Uh, a few lacerations...

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:17.630
but I was able to tourniquet them off
with this bandanna I found.

01:31:17.737 --> 01:31:21.833
I never should've said anything to you
that, uh, I didn't mean.

01:31:23.743 --> 01:31:26.177
Uh, I'm sorry.

01:31:30.617 --> 01:31:32.312
Um-

01:31:33.353 --> 01:31:35.821
- Oh.
- Here.

01:31:35.922 --> 01:31:37.822
Thank you for the loan.

01:31:37.924 --> 01:31:40.188
You're welcome.

01:31:40.293 --> 01:31:42.261
I have to go.

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:50.334
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:31:50.437 --> 01:31:52.405
Bye.

Don't ever change- for anybody.

I'm Jewish-Catholic.

01:32:05.218 --> 01:32:07.118

Anything?</i>

01:32:41.488 --> 01:32:45.185

Good to see you. Okay, all right.

- Let's do this.

01:33:15.689 --> 01:33:20.285
Hartman Hughes,
you reminded us to believe in miracles.

01:33:20.393 --> 01:33:22.293
What does it feel like to be a hero?

01:33:22.395 --> 01:33:24.295
I'm not a hero.

01:33:24.397 --> 01:33:26.922
I'm a humble guy who's lucky to be alive.

01:33:27.033 --> 01:33:31.129
<i>- And, uh, I think any hardworking...</i>
