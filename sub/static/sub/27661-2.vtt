Nathan: It's been two months.

a miscommunication,

filled out those applications,

18:33.213 --> 18:35.172
You and I, we just got off
on the wrong foot.

18:35.172 --> 18:38.630
- Actually, I'm the, uh,
source of the problem.

18:40.255 --> 18:42.338
Look, we've been trying
to make things

18:42.338 --> 18:44.130
more stable for Charlie,

18:44.130 --> 18:46.338
but I've created some
serious obstacles for Kate.

18:46.338 --> 18:48.338
It's not her fault.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.963
- Well, I do offer counselling.

18:51.963 --> 18:53.130
- No, we're good.
- No, thanks.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.463
- I think we need to go
to therapy.

19:02.463 --> 19:04.463
- No one can fix our problems,
Nathan.

19:04.463 --> 19:06.630
- Maybe not, but we have
to figure out

19:06.630 --> 19:08.797
how to parent together,
right?

19:10.588 --> 19:12.463
Okay, fine.
You know what?

19:12.463 --> 19:14.130
We'll just let the lawyers
figure it out.

19:14.130 --> 19:15.588
- Well...

19:15.588 --> 19:17.130
- I can't fight with you
anymore, Kate.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.338
I love you, buddy.
