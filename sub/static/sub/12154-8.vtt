00:19.227 --> 00:22.696
{\a5}L'Ã‰quipe Ã  Roger

00:22.863 --> 00:26.044
{\a3}Synchro: mpm

00:52.198 --> 00:54.522
Don't both of you think
this whole fight thing

00:54.647 --> 00:57.751
between two magazines
is a bit ridiculous?

00:57.876 --> 00:59.436
- Well...
- Yes, but it's {\good }publicity,

00:59.561 --> 01:02.028
especially in today's publishing market.
And from what I understand

01:02.153 --> 01:04.619
George's magazine
could really use the ink.

01:05.488 --> 01:06.388
I agree.

01:07.047 --> 01:08.797
Our whole fight is inane.

01:09.046 --> 01:11.418
I'm doing this
because Richard challenged me

01:11.543 --> 01:13.693
and, as a gentleman, I accepted.

01:13.913 --> 01:16.346
But Richard challenged you
because you wrote,

01:16.471 --> 01:20.475
among other things, that he had
the penis of a hermaphrodite.

01:20.839 --> 01:22.718
That was sloppy journalism.

01:23.622 --> 01:25.955
I do want to apologize

01:26.080 --> 01:28.201
to any hermaphrodites

01:28.326 --> 01:31.813
who may have been insulted
by an unflattering comparison.

01:33.506 --> 01:35.316
So why are you two fighting?

01:35.441 --> 01:38.516
Richard's my boss
and he said I had to.

01:39.224 --> 01:43.058
For a team to win in a match like this,
it has to be the best two out of three,

01:43.183 --> 01:45.629
and he said that we needed
a cartoonist on our side

01:45.754 --> 01:47.453
since Ray is a cartoonist.

01:49.648 --> 01:52.098
I really love your comics,
by the way.

01:54.107 --> 01:57.613
They say that the pen
is mightier than the sword,

01:58.155 --> 01:59.869
but when we meet in the ring

02:00.463 --> 02:01.536
my fist

02:01.705 --> 02:03.895
will be mightier than my pen.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.391
I wish your pen
were mightier than your fist,

02:06.516 --> 02:08.451
but your honest assessment
of your talent

02:08.576 --> 02:10.920
is quite commendable
and appreciated. Cheers.

02:12.884 --> 02:15.284
I'm looking forward
to being punched.

02:15.853 --> 02:19.194
I've never actually practiced S&M,
but I've always wanted to

02:19.319 --> 02:21.993
and, you know, this seems like
a really good opportunity,

02:22.617 --> 02:26.123
especially since I'll be hit
by someone whose work I admire.

02:26.672 --> 02:28.419
I think that a homoerotic subtext

02:28.544 --> 02:30.986
is precisely what this fight
needs to make it more lively.

02:31.111 --> 02:33.986
I'm sorry to put you
on the spot, Mrs. Antrem,

02:34.155 --> 02:37.466
but you've been married
to both of these gentlemen.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.027
What do you think of all this?

02:39.152 --> 02:42.578
{\I think }The whole thing is absurd. I don't want
either of them getting hurt.

02:45.891 --> 02:47.491
{\a1}Hands up all the time.

02:48.013 --> 02:50.127
{\a1}The guy you're fighting is tall.
Remember,

02:50.295 --> 02:51.694
you gotta make a sandwich.

02:51.819 --> 02:53.343
{\a3}Your hands are the bread.

02:53.468 --> 02:54.814
{\a3}Your head is the meat.

02:54.939 --> 02:56.133
Protect the meat.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.935
Okay, Sal, thank you.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.291
Bread, meat.

03:06.246 --> 03:09.103
{\a3}I've really been fantasizing
about beating Louis Greene.

03:09.228 --> 03:11.148
He's been rude to me
one too many times.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.517
{\a3}Yeah, I have nothing
against the weirdo that I'm boxing,

03:14.642 --> 03:17.920
{\a3}but I'm looking forward
to kicking his ass, you know?

03:21.505 --> 03:23.206
I keep having this daydream

03:23.331 --> 03:25.913
that if I win I get Priscilla back.

03:26.263 --> 03:28.363
Why'd you ever lose her anyway?

03:29.130 --> 03:30.631
{\a1}She was like a cat.

03:30.756 --> 03:33.504
{\a1}She'd never come to me
when I wanted her to.

03:33.690 --> 03:35.204
That's why I like dogs.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.658
But when she did come to me,
{\I mean, }it was magnificent.

03:37.783 --> 03:39.552
She was highly orgasmic.

03:39.993 --> 03:42.843
{\a1}When she sees what I do
to Antrem in the ring,

03:43.049 --> 03:46.175
{\a1}she'll be reminded of what it's like
to be in bed with me.

03:53.097 --> 03:54.847
That's how you make love?

04:16.947 --> 04:17.993
<i>It's Stella.</i>

04:18.118 --> 04:20.177
<i>We met a few weeks ago at the co-op.</i>

04:20.302 --> 04:21.675
Yeah, hi.
How are you?

04:21.800 --> 04:22.800
<i>I'm good.</i>

04:24.136 --> 04:26.480
And, I don't know,
I was thinking about you

04:26.605 --> 04:28.708
<i>and I was wondering</i>

04:29.144 --> 04:31.267
<i>if you wanted to hang out tonight.</i>

04:33.532 --> 04:35.342
I'm supposed
to be working on my novel.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.742
<i>Well, I got this really good pot...</i>

04:37.867 --> 04:40.025
<i>Medical marijuana from California.</i>

04:40.333 --> 04:41.902
<i>It could help with your writing.</i>

04:47.312 --> 04:49.121
Why don't you have shelves?

04:49.383 --> 04:52.541
My girl... My ex-girlfriend
took them with her when she moved out.

04:54.746 --> 04:56.086
Why don't you build some?

04:56.495 --> 04:59.173
- I'm not very mechanical.
- I could build them for you.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.549
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.744
I used to work
for Habitat For Humanity.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.345
You did?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.441
I'm human.

05:08.987 --> 05:09.903
Let's play.

05:10.028 --> 05:11.644
I never miss when I'm stoned,

05:11.812 --> 05:13.729
or it's like I don't care if I do.

05:14.976 --> 05:15.976
Come on.

05:16.442 --> 05:17.316
Let's go.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.101
- What?
- Game on.

05:19.551 --> 05:22.738
- What's the name of your{\ basketball} team?
- The "in your face".

05:22.907 --> 05:24.833
- {\What's the name of your team}And yours?
- The kicking your butts.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.213
You are? That's weird.

05:26.338 --> 05:28.994
It's kind of a stupid name for a team
that doesn't even do that at all.

05:32.686 --> 05:35.626
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Where's the ball?

05:44.156 --> 05:45.831
Is this Jonathan ames?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.340
<i>Yes. Who's this?</i>

05:48.600 --> 05:50.596
It's not important who it is.

05:50.721 --> 05:52.593
What is important
is that you take a dive

05:52.718 --> 05:55.104
in your fight with Louis Greene,
or else...

05:55.339 --> 05:56.605
Or else what?

05:56.774 --> 05:58.646
Or else we're gonna make
George Christopher

05:58.771 --> 06:02.653
the publishing world's laughingstock
and maybe even the magazine world too.

06:03.702 --> 06:07.324
- What are you talking about?
- <i>I'm talking about you taking a dive.</i>

06:07.493 --> 06:09.344
All right?
I gotta go. Bye.

06:15.647 --> 06:18.915
That's a weird phone call...
Probably one of your disturbed friends.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.630
No, you're my only disturbed friend
who would do something like that.

06:21.958 --> 06:24.291
Don't mention it to George.
I don't want to upset him.

06:24.416 --> 06:25.852
Are you gonna do anything{\ about it}?

06:25.977 --> 06:28.178
No, nothing to do.
It's gotta be a prank.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.040
Let me get you guys wrapped.

06:32.602 --> 06:34.768
I had a really nice time
with Stella last night.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.479
She's the first girl since Suzanne
I kind of have feelings for.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.765
- Did you at least bang her?
- Yeah, did you bang her?

06:42.431 --> 06:44.261
It was like a real date.

06:44.386 --> 06:45.883
We played nerf basketball

06:46.008 --> 06:48.115
listened to music.
We didn't even kiss.

06:48.284 --> 06:51.994
- What, are you in the fifth grade?
- I lost my virginity in the 5th grade.

06:52.309 --> 06:53.745
What was his name?

06:53.870 --> 06:55.120
Father Francis.

07:25.373 --> 07:27.306
I'm gonna kick your ass, Antrem.

07:27.589 --> 07:30.365
You're an idiot, a fool, a slob.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.126
I can't stand you.

07:32.914 --> 07:35.471
You should never have
married my ex-wife.

07:36.464 --> 07:38.279
You're gonna shoot your whole wad.

07:38.404 --> 07:39.993
Save it for tomorrow night.

07:40.118 --> 07:42.106
Yeah, you're right.
Thanks thanks.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.994
I want to thank both of you
for supporting me in this whole thing.

08:00.678 --> 08:02.712
I know it's delusional behavior,

08:04.084 --> 08:05.834
but it's important to me.

08:06.856 --> 08:10.592
- I like being delusional.
- Me too. We're delusional together.

08:11.352 --> 08:12.352
Thank you.

08:13.472 --> 08:16.322
We're gonna kick
some major <i>GQ</i> ass tomorrow.

08:17.566 --> 08:18.587
I can feel it.

08:18.712 --> 08:21.041
I just hope I don't get
a brain injury.

08:24.121 --> 08:25.771
What, is that a bridge?

08:32.066 --> 08:35.429
- <i>Hey, practicing for your dive{\tomorrow night}?</i>
- Why should I?

08:35.599 --> 08:37.140
Because I have something you want.

08:37.496 --> 08:38.892
{\What are you talking about?}What do you have?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.614
I have a Viagra bottle.

08:40.739 --> 08:43.139
The name on it...
George Christopher.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.440
He's been on this stuff
since 1997...

08:45.981 --> 08:47.381
<i>Plenty of refills.</i>

08:47.614 --> 08:49.820
- How did you get that?
- <i>Hey, you know what? Shut up.</i>

08:49.989 --> 08:51.161
Here's the drill:

08:51.286 --> 08:53.602
you're gonna take a dive
in your fight tomorrow,

08:53.727 --> 08:55.903
or else this bottle's
going to "page six"

08:56.028 --> 08:58.828
and Christopher,
the so-called "ladies' man,"

08:58.953 --> 09:00.205
is gonna be humiliated.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.456
<i>All right,</i>

09:01.625 --> 09:03.358
gotta go.
Hanging up.

09:14.736 --> 09:16.471
- What the fuck?
- I'm Jonathan Ames.

09:16.755 --> 09:18.473
Get the fuck out of here.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.101
- What the hell is that thing?
- You don't want to find out.

09:23.543 --> 09:27.024
- Where's the Viagra bottle?
- {\I don't know }What you're talking about, asshole?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.878
- Come on, man.
- Settle down.

09:42.003 --> 09:45.792
- Shit, how did you find me?
- You called from your home{\ phone}, amateur.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.461
I'm not a fucking amateur.

09:47.882 --> 09:49.882
Where did you get the Viagra?

09:51.036 --> 09:52.686
You can't make me talk.

09:55.144 --> 09:56.511
This thing picks locks.

09:56.806 --> 09:59.156
It also does a nice job on eardrums.

09:59.427 --> 10:01.674
I got it
from George Christopher's dumpster.

10:01.799 --> 10:04.794
You're not smart enough
to mastermind a job like this.

10:04.919 --> 10:06.104
Who put you up to it?

10:06.290 --> 10:09.176
You know what?
I'm a lot of things, but I ain't no rat.

10:16.522 --> 10:17.897
Hey, wait wait.

10:18.022 --> 10:20.922
Don't tell Greene
I screwed this up, all right?

10:21.128 --> 10:23.747
He'll be pissed off. And
he's supposed to give me $200.

10:23.952 --> 10:25.813
You want to make that kind of money?

10:27.778 --> 10:28.878
Bet on Ames.

10:42.483 --> 10:44.768
Oh my God, really?

10:46.108 --> 10:48.146
No, yeah, send her up.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.444
I'm so happy to see you.

10:56.648 --> 10:57.648
Come in.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.483
Come in.
Come in.

11:20.799 --> 11:23.848
- <i>It's Stella. What are you doing?</i>
- Trying to write.

11:23.973 --> 11:27.039
My book's due tomorrow
and{\ now} I've got 47,000 words left to go.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.970
Also I have a boxing match tomorrow.
I'm losing my mind.

11:30.696 --> 11:32.528
<i>Shit.
I won't bug you then.</i>

11:32.653 --> 11:34.026
<i>We'll do it another time.</i>

11:34.151 --> 11:37.001
<i>The vaporizer I ordered
finally arrived today.</i>

11:51.795 --> 11:54.633
Just squeeze down on that nipple

11:54.992 --> 11:57.142
and suck in the marijuana vapor.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.899
It's like I've been instantly
and beautifully lobotomized.

12:14.712 --> 12:15.712
I know.

12:16.461 --> 12:17.761
And it's healthy

12:18.205 --> 12:20.205
because it's invisible vapor.

12:30.263 --> 12:32.163
Your apartment is beautiful.

12:37.302 --> 12:39.466
It's a little cold,
though, isn't it?

12:41.543 --> 12:43.976
I mean, I sort of float around here

12:44.101 --> 12:45.663
trying not to make a mess,

12:45.788 --> 12:47.974
almost like
it's someone else's home.

12:49.457 --> 12:52.629
George, I've come here
to talk to you about something.

12:53.836 --> 12:57.790
- Your fight tomorrow...
- Can we talk about the past first?

12:58.703 --> 13:00.103
I have no filters.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.509
My frontal lobes may be going,

13:02.634 --> 13:04.568
but I have to say immediately

13:04.693 --> 13:07.160
that I haven't stopped
thinking about you in 20 years

13:08.202 --> 13:10.142
and that you look very beautiful.

13:12.653 --> 13:15.418
I'm really glad
that you could hang out.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.839
There was this pollen
in the air today

13:17.964 --> 13:19.660
that smelled like kissing.

13:20.552 --> 13:21.800
Do you know that smell?

13:24.864 --> 13:26.096
I love that smell.

13:37.953 --> 13:40.169
Do you remember our little apartment

13:41.289 --> 13:42.445
on west 11th

13:43.465 --> 13:44.948
with the curtains by the window?

13:45.753 --> 13:47.437
Yes, of course I remember.

13:47.620 --> 13:50.620
Do you still like
to role-play <i>Nosferatu</i> ?

13:53.269 --> 13:54.269
'Cause...

13:54.862 --> 13:56.632
every couple of months

13:57.752 --> 13:59.169
I have this recurring dream

13:59.294 --> 14:02.366
where I'm in the curtains, hiding,

14:02.491 --> 14:04.764
and that I'm kissing your neck.

14:05.763 --> 14:09.008
George, I don't want you
to fight Richard tomorrow.

14:09.841 --> 14:10.667
What?

14:13.708 --> 14:16.058
I can't back out.
I'd be humiliated.

14:16.391 --> 14:17.606
He challenged me.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.827
He would never tell you,
but he has a heart condition.

14:21.254 --> 14:22.652
He shouldn't exert himself.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.697
What do you want me to do?

14:25.876 --> 14:27.226
Just let him win.

14:28.475 --> 14:30.131
What do you call it?
You know,

14:30.868 --> 14:31.953
take a dive.

14:33.052 --> 14:34.239
Wait, going back,

14:34.364 --> 14:36.064
when you say that he...

14:37.232 --> 14:40.170
can't exert himself,
does that mean...?

14:40.339 --> 14:42.506
Yes, we haven't had sex
in two years.

14:43.847 --> 14:45.408
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

15:00.744 --> 15:02.006
I'm married.

15:10.787 --> 15:12.537
I think I'm still coming.

15:13.365 --> 15:16.564
My whole body is vibrating
like a tuning fork.

15:17.607 --> 15:18.607
I'm glad.

15:19.234 --> 15:20.691
I'm not vibrating,

15:21.221 --> 15:23.021
but I do feel really good.

15:29.414 --> 15:31.614
Why couldn't you write your novel?

15:32.117 --> 15:33.267
I don't know.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.618
I just wasn't into it.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.868
I don't mean to give you advice,

15:43.101 --> 15:44.951
but my writing teacher said

15:45.116 --> 15:47.933
that you should only write
about what you love.

15:48.058 --> 15:49.408
I'm not a writer,

15:50.081 --> 15:52.462
but that's what I try to do
when I paint.

15:54.735 --> 15:56.085
What do you love?

15:59.851 --> 16:02.551
I love being
a part-time private detective.

16:03.534 --> 16:05.634
I actually solved a case today.

16:05.759 --> 16:07.803
Then that's what you should
write about.

16:17.997 --> 16:20.174
Want to vaporize some more pot?

16:21.749 --> 16:23.273
I want to vaporize you.

16:28.951 --> 16:30.755
That was lovely, George.

16:32.317 --> 16:33.317
I know.

16:36.439 --> 16:38.689
Thank you for being so sweet to me.

16:41.036 --> 16:43.236
It's not hard to be sweet to you.

16:46.591 --> 16:49.691
I think that we've entered
a third act,

16:50.583 --> 16:52.206
despite what Fitzgerald says

16:52.331 --> 16:54.931
about there being
no second acts in life.

16:56.823 --> 16:58.123
We were married,

16:59.777 --> 17:00.777
divorced,

17:03.472 --> 17:04.625
and now lovers.

17:11.174 --> 17:12.973
Will you throw the fight?

17:25.020 --> 17:27.337
Actually, I kind of like
this girl Stella.

17:27.712 --> 17:30.457
She's sexy as hell, smart, jewish,

17:30.582 --> 17:32.133
has a great vaporizer.

17:32.516 --> 17:35.512
- Sounds like your mother.
- I'd like to try a vaporizer.

17:35.825 --> 17:39.692
Do you think I blew it by having sex?
Do you think I'll lose to Greene?

17:39.817 --> 17:42.351
Sal said we weren't supposed to
drink or have sex before the fight.

17:42.476 --> 17:43.853
I want to do what Sal says.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.986
Well, I had sex and booze.

17:46.467 --> 17:50.471
- Who did you have sex with?
- I can't {\really }say, but I have no regrets.

17:51.220 --> 17:54.280
It's the first time I haven't
had to use Viagra in years.

17:55.265 --> 17:57.117
Look, it's the losing team.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.619
Yeah, we're not supposed
to see each other till the fight.

17:59.848 --> 18:02.592
What, is this a wedding?
I can't see you in your dress?

18:02.717 --> 18:04.332
Don't be such a frail plant.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.834
Save it for the ring.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.012
Many fighters choose
to listen to music before a fight.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.833
It gets them pumped up.

18:26.991 --> 18:28.863
I've chosen to listen
to your audiobook.

18:28.988 --> 18:31.568
I find it properly enraging,
so thank you.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.613
I have the Viagra bottle.
It was a dirty trick you tried to pull.

18:35.790 --> 18:37.849
You don't read much Machiavelli,
do you?

18:37.974 --> 18:40.702
There are no dirty tricks,
just winning and losing.

18:41.405 --> 18:44.768
Don't worry, I'm prepared to beat you
even playing by the rules.

18:59.455 --> 19:01.977
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Not to worry.

19:02.102 --> 19:03.852
I'm fighting a masochist.

19:04.682 --> 19:05.882
He'll be okay.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.425
Okay, look, I'm gonna
do the old rope-a-dope,

19:08.550 --> 19:10.922
just like Will Smith in <i>Ali</i>.
I watched it last night.

19:11.047 --> 19:12.169
You mean, like Ali?

19:12.294 --> 19:14.917
Yeah, but I didn't see Ali.
I saw Will Smith playing Ali.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.226
Anyway, I'm gonna exhaust him
by doing rope-a-dope.

19:17.351 --> 19:19.098
- All right, champ.
- Okay, let's go.

19:19.223 --> 19:20.873
Kick his ass.
Come on.

19:21.000 --> 19:21.868
Go Ray!

19:22.738 --> 19:24.838
Remember, hands up.
Go get him.

19:28.353 --> 19:30.946
Gentlemen, I want a good, clean fight.
Protect yourselves at all times.

19:31.071 --> 19:33.463
- Touch gloves.
- Hey, thanks for doing this.

19:52.606 --> 19:53.983
What the fuck was that?

19:54.507 --> 19:56.164
- I'm getting up.
- Don't.

19:56.289 --> 19:59.139
- Why?
- Because I don't want you to get hurt.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.431
I want you in one piece tonight.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.369
- Really?
- Yes, really.

20:04.723 --> 20:07.372
- ... Eight, nine...
- I do love you, you know.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.953
10! It's over.

20:10.848 --> 20:11.960
Man, get up.

20:12.404 --> 20:13.760
I didn't get hurt yet.

20:15.025 --> 20:17.125
I didn't mean to knock you down.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.226
Crap.

20:22.239 --> 20:23.564
Yeah, that's not bad.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.234
Holy shit, Stella came.
I didn't know she was coming.

20:36.534 --> 20:37.483
In you go.

20:41.954 --> 20:43.213
I suddenly feel scared.

20:43.338 --> 20:45.733
That's normal.
All fighters are scared.

20:46.033 --> 20:49.169
But once you get in the ring
you're like a god.

20:54.071 --> 20:55.316
But I'm agnostic.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.291
I'll say a prayer for you.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.735
I want a good, clean fight.
Touch gloves. Go to your corners.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.141
At the bell, fight.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.956
Go, Jonathan.

21:10.776 --> 21:13.457
Protect the meat.
Your head is the meat.

21:13.582 --> 21:14.689
Your hands...

21:18.813 --> 21:19.967
I'll say it again...

21:20.092 --> 21:22.363
Your first novel
was amateurish at best.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.971
You are a lousy critic

21:24.096 --> 21:26.242
and a small-time blackmailer.
What do you know?

21:38.311 --> 21:40.632
Do yourself and the reading public
a favor...

21:40.954 --> 21:43.676
If you feel the need to write,
you can always keep a diary.

21:43.844 --> 21:44.802
You shut up!

21:45.732 --> 21:48.348
<i>The New York Times</i> said
my prose was lucid!

21:52.686 --> 21:54.896
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

21:55.064 --> 21:56.438
Don't say you're sorry.

21:56.563 --> 21:59.153
I didn't know
<i>The Times</i> liked your work.

21:59.278 --> 22:00.384
... six, seven...

22:00.509 --> 22:03.237
- I must have missed it.
- ... Eight, nine, ten! It's over.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.276
You were amazing.

22:29.401 --> 22:30.890
I'm so proud of you.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.017
You want to come over{\ again tonight} and celebrate?

22:33.186 --> 22:36.520
I can't. I already have
a urinary tract infection.

22:36.645 --> 22:39.107
I always get them after I
have sex. I don't know why.

22:40.146 --> 22:42.235
We don't have to have sex.
We could just hang out.

22:42.646 --> 22:44.896
No, it would be too frustrating.

22:45.266 --> 22:48.511
We'll see each other in a week.
I'll drink a ton of cranberry juice.

22:48.636 --> 22:51.536
But I have to go now.
I'm meeting some friends.

22:51.943 --> 22:53.393
You were an animal.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.286
Come on, George.

23:18.597 --> 23:21.337
No no, that's a low blow...
A low blow.

23:21.598 --> 23:23.721
- Watch those punches.
- Tell him.

23:24.005 --> 23:25.005
Come on.

23:45.329 --> 23:47.667
Quit holding on to me
like a little schoolgirl.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.387
You're holding on to me.
Everyone can see that it's you{ holding on to me}.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.307
Why are we doing this again?

23:54.476 --> 23:57.714
You said my mouth was shaped
like the anus of a starfish.

24:09.217 --> 24:10.368
Nice, George!

24:10.967 --> 24:14.275
You're destroying him.
Holy shit, <i>Edition</i> might beat <i>GQ</i>.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.731
I know.
It feels so good.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.238
Keep working your jab.

24:20.864 --> 24:21.876
Deep breaths{\, deep breaths}.

24:22.906 --> 24:24.006
You got him.

24:35.555 --> 24:37.597
Stay loose{\, stay loose}.
Stay loose, champ.

24:39.762 --> 24:41.771
Touch gloves.
At the bell, fight.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.528
It's your round,
George. It's your round.

25:02.173 --> 25:03.543
George, get up.

25:04.209 --> 25:05.204
One...

25:05.329 --> 25:06.329
two...

25:06.839 --> 25:07.839
three...

25:08.465 --> 25:09.289
four...

25:09.806 --> 25:10.800
five...

25:11.123 --> 25:12.009
six...

25:12.569 --> 25:13.569
seven...

25:14.161 --> 25:15.054
eight...

25:15.587 --> 25:16.467
nine...

25:16.871 --> 25:18.683
ten...
It's over.

25:34.512 --> 25:36.412
Who's the hermaphrodite now?

25:40.401 --> 25:42.479
You showed a lot of heart, George.

25:46.770 --> 25:49.770
I think I'm gonna skip out
on the post-fight drinks.

25:50.408 --> 25:53.154
This whole violent thing
has turned Leah on.

25:53.279 --> 25:57.032
She wants to have sex tonight.
It's the first time in weeks.

25:57.157 --> 25:59.541
- That's great, Ray.
- Thanks.

26:01.150 --> 26:03.050
You guys were great tonight.

26:15.238 --> 26:16.805
What can I tell you, George?

26:16.930 --> 26:19.487
It's life, isn't it?
It's the law of the jungle.

26:19.612 --> 26:20.620
It's Darwin.

26:20.798 --> 26:22.648
Whatever you say, Richard.

26:24.897 --> 26:27.301
I'll see you around campus.

26:27.974 --> 26:29.074
Okay, champ?

26:46.890 --> 26:49.023
Let's get in there one more time.

26:56.678 --> 26:57.678
Thank you.

27:02.344 --> 27:04.441
Do you think we learned
anything tonight?

27:07.039 --> 27:08.339
But that's okay.

27:08.659 --> 27:10.797
It's good to stay in the dark
about things.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.768
It keeps life interesting.

27:16.361 --> 27:18.187
I'm glad you're in my life.

27:19.079 --> 27:21.329
I'm glad you're in mine, Jonathan.

27:29.991 --> 27:30.991
Come on.

27:32.374 --> 27:35.153
- I see.
- Yeah, that's what it is.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.548
I think I got the reach
on you there.

27:38.673 --> 27:40.073
Yeah, that's true.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.260
But I have the low
center of gravity.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.974
It allows me to do things like this.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.899
Slow down, little bugger.
