WEBVTT

00:50.842 --> 00:53.428
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.511 --> 00:56.139
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:01.478 --> 01:03.354
Are you looking for this?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.734
So you knew it.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.906
Why are you doing this?

01:14.199 --> 01:16.993
-Why am I doing this?
-Yes.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.662
-Because I can.
-Pardon?

01:20.330 --> 01:22.290
The possibility is like ecstasy.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.299
Step back!

01:56.699 --> 01:58.993
-Is he dead?
-No.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.166
-Did you kill him, Yo-han?
-I said, no.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.088
Wait.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.173
So he's not dead.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.217
How boring.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.887
What do you mean boring?

02:24.060 --> 02:25.520
Where am I?

02:26.312 --> 02:27.647
Not paradise, for sure.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.110
I wouldn't move just yet.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.997
HEAD JUDGE KANG YO-HAN

02:44.080 --> 02:48.751
UNDER INVESTIGATION

02:54.799 --> 02:56.843
The explosives attack
at the Judge's Chambers

02:56.926 --> 03:00.555
has shocked the entire nation,
and citizens are expressing their concerns

03:00.638 --> 03:02.724
<i>for Judge Kang Yo-han's safety.</i>

03:02.807 --> 03:06.394
<i>The police have announced</i>
<i>that a full investigation is now underway,</i>

03:06.477 --> 03:09.564
and that they have secured the footages
and the visitor records.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.941
-It's Kang Yo-han!
-It's Kang Yo-han.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.652
-He's coming out.
-It's Kang Yo-han!

03:15.612 --> 03:18.239
-Do you have him on camera?
-Over there! There he is.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.493
Here he comes.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.829
Judge Kang. Are your injuries severe?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.247
How is your condition?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.917
-How is your health?
-Judge Kang, are you all right?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.711
Thanks to our citizens,
I'm in good health.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.296
What about your injuries then?

03:34.964 --> 03:36.216
It's bearable.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.427
-Who is behind the attack?
-Nothing is for certain as of yet.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.972
Could it be an attack by an opposition
disaffected with the <i>Live Court Show</i>?

03:43.056 --> 03:43.973
Maybe.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.351
Does that mean
the trials will be put on hiatus?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.563
I have a message for all of our citizens.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.274
It seems someone is feeling
quite intimidated right now,

03:53.358 --> 03:57.195
but we cannot stop the trial
by a cowardly act of terrorism.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.657
The trial will proceed as planned.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.368
Then what will be the next case
to be put on trial?

04:07.205 --> 04:11.709
It'll be a son of a power class who used
his status to repeatedly assault the weak.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.212
Our defendant is Lee Yeong-min,

04:14.796 --> 04:16.506
Vice President of Joongwon F&B.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.216
Lee Yeong-min?

04:18.299 --> 04:22.220
Do you perhaps mean the son
of Cha Gyeong-hui, Minister of Justice?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.055
-What's he saying?
-<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

04:24.138 --> 04:28.851
<i>Would the Prosecution overlook you put</i>
<i>the son of Minister of Justice on trial?</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:31.020
All citizens are equal before the law.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.108
To me, all defendants
are the same and equal.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.277
That bastard!

04:47.328 --> 04:50.039
<i>Still, various forms of resistance</i>
<i>are expected.</i>

04:51.541 --> 04:54.335
Let the street dogs bark,
for the train will not stop.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.421
Street dogs?

04:57.755 --> 05:00.300
<i>You're awesome, Judge Kang!</i>

05:00.383 --> 05:01.592
<i>You are truly admirable!</i>

05:11.394 --> 05:12.437
Yeong-min.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.025
Minister. Minister Cha!

05:29.370 --> 05:30.371
Police.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.042
Judge Kang!

05:35.585 --> 05:36.878
Is Judge Kim Ga-on okay?

05:38.046 --> 05:39.297
May I ask who…

05:39.380 --> 05:41.591
I'm Yoon Su-hyeon from WAIS.
I'm in charge of this case.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.676
I see. I'll be in your care.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.261
Is Judge Kim Ga-on okay?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.598
Yes, he's fine. Are you personally
acquainted with Judge Kim?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.683
For instance, are you his girlfriend?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.061
No. We're just friends.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.105
I didn't know he had
a friend who's a detective.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.607
Where is Ga-on?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.902
I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you that now.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.696
-Pardon?
-What Judge Kim needs is absolute rest.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.989
There may be follow-up attacks,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.742
so it's best he focuses
on recovering where it's safe.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.579
-Where is he? Let me see him.
-Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.248
I apologize, Judge Kang.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.586
Go out there and catch the culprit.
Leave Judge Kim to me.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.852
Who are you?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.730
I'm sorry.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.524
Why do you look so surprised?

06:40.608 --> 06:44.112
Didn't Master Yo-han tell you anything?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.738
What do you mean, exactly?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.827
Then I have no more to say.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.746
I'll bring your food again.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.173
"Master"?

07:05.883 --> 07:07.051
Honestly, the rich…

09:10.132 --> 09:13.302
This looks ancient.
I wonder when it was made.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.180
-That's a national treasure.
-What? My gosh…

09:20.309 --> 09:22.770
Just kidding. How dumb are you?

09:22.853 --> 09:26.107
Stop poking your nose here and there
and just stay put.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.527
Who are you,
and where are your honorifics?

09:33.656 --> 09:34.490
I'm Elijah.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.534
Ellie? Is that a name?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.495
As in "Elijah," idiot.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.205
Have you never read the Bible?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.876
So, Elijah.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.338
Did I ever wrong you in any way?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.429
-Your face.
-What?

09:56.512 --> 09:57.847
I don't like your face.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.266
How dare you.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.810
"How dare you"?
What's this about my face now?

10:03.311 --> 10:05.479
Why did he even bring home
something like him?

10:05.563 --> 10:08.316
-He's a fake.
-Hey. Wait!

10:09.525 --> 10:10.610
Hey.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.948
What is this house?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.536
<i>Dad, what do I do?</i>

10:21.037 --> 10:23.456
What did I ever do
to be put on a kangaroo trial?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.124
Honestly, that crazy psycho…

10:25.207 --> 10:27.501
I must say, he is completely insane.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.503
What kind of a judge is that?

10:30.421 --> 10:32.048
Don't you worry, Yeong-min.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.175
Your mother will stop everything.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.136
I mean,
how dare they try and touch my son?

10:47.938 --> 10:48.856
Dad.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.568
-There's something I haven't told you.
-Yes?

10:53.527 --> 10:55.571
That psycho, Kang Yo-han…

10:55.655 --> 10:59.075
-I think he's been after me all this time.
-What do you mean?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.535
Well, you see…

11:03.412 --> 11:04.288
Yeong-min.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.419
Yeong-min?

11:11.128 --> 11:12.421
-Yes.
-Honey.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.174
Mom.

11:18.678 --> 11:23.182
Will you keep disappointing me like this?

11:23.683 --> 11:24.975
I'm sorry.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.770
Now look at me, straight in the eye.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.814
Hurry up.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.109
Come on, hurry up.

11:35.444 --> 11:38.531
Don't you worry.
Nothing's going to happen to you.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.741
Do you hear me?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.160
Yes.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.628
Honey, will he really be okay?

11:54.296 --> 11:57.633
What have you been doing all this time
while he ended up like this?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.594
Well, I took care of everything perfectly,

12:00.678 --> 12:04.557
except for this one case
which didn't go as planned…

12:06.350 --> 12:07.810
But he should be okay, right?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.104
Don't worry.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.445
That trial will never commence.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.750
Will you just let him be?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.334
You're here.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.254
Hello, Minister.

12:37.506 --> 12:41.093
So what did you mean by that just now?
Let him be? Who is "he"?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.305
-Please excuse me, then.
-What, already?

12:44.388 --> 12:47.516
Given my position,
this meeting wouldn't be so appropriate.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.685
I shouldn't have contact
with the defendant's family.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.605
No hard feelings, Minister Cha.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.024
Work is work, after all.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.654
The same goes for me. No hard feelings.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.032
That also applies to
whatever I choose to do next.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.048
Judge Kang?

13:21.717 --> 13:22.676
Director Jung.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.472
Do you have a message from the foundation?

13:26.555 --> 13:29.266
I do have many messages to deliver,
here and there.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.727
Anyway, are you all right?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.145
You're not hurt anywhere?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.274
This recent attack was quite something.

13:37.983 --> 13:38.818
Pardon?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.904
It wasn't big enough to kill anyone,

13:41.987 --> 13:43.739
but not too small to ignore either.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.492
It was just enough to blow up a little.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.161
As if it was a message
of warning for someone.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.666
Gosh, that is quite peculiar indeed.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.168
Or it could just be my wild imagination.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.507
But then again, there are people
who are able to understand the warnings

14:02.174 --> 14:06.887
and those who fail to understand them
and regret it later.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.305
I agree.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.392
There are people in this world
who fail to understand the warnings.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.701
Our benefactors are extremely concerned.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.537
They are worried
that it could provoke the people

14:31.620 --> 14:34.206
right before announcing
the Dream Base project.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.042
I apologize, Minister Cha.

14:39.128 --> 14:43.716
As you know, the media is sensitive
about the power abuse by the elites.

14:44.550 --> 14:49.013
That's why you should have maintained
full control in these sensitive times.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.390
Or does your son have
anger management issues?

14:51.473 --> 14:53.893
Does he normally suffer
from extreme mood swings?

14:53.976 --> 14:57.938
Or is it because of an overbearing mother?
Maybe because of that, he must be…

15:02.192 --> 15:05.738
I hesitated about bringing this up
with you, Minister Cha,

15:05.821 --> 15:09.408
but your glares can be quite daunting.

15:09.491 --> 15:14.038
And it's not good for women
to have such domineering presence.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.958
I think you're stepping over the line.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.756
So, why don't we go
with another case for--

15:23.839 --> 15:25.758
More than a million have signed it.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.385
The national petition.

15:28.469 --> 15:33.474
"Please expose the mastermind
responsible for attacking our Judge Kang."

15:35.684 --> 15:37.394
Isn't that just astounding?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.605
In just a day,
we had a million signatures.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.815
It's as if a riot will break out

15:41.899 --> 15:44.360
if we try and mess
with Kang Yo-han the wrong way.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.862
All right, I understand.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.490
If it's too much
of a burden for the government,

15:49.573 --> 15:50.991
then I will take care of it.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.133
What are you doing?

16:09.468 --> 16:10.970
What do you think I'm doing?

16:12.137 --> 16:13.305
I'll do it.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.808
I'm not doing this
because I want to. Stay still.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.352
-But I can--
-I said, just stay still.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.731
Now get up.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.698
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.836
-What about that lady just now?
-Who?

16:44.753 --> 16:47.297
The nanny? She went home.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.549
She's your nanny?

16:52.302 --> 16:53.345
What is this?

16:57.099 --> 16:58.809
Something from my immature past.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.186
That's unexpected.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.772
-Are you a boomer?
-What?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.900
Judging others based on their own liking
is typical of boomers.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.327
That really hurt!

17:17.411 --> 17:20.122
It's typical of immature boys
to throw a tantrum.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.540
What? Tantrum?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.881
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

17:28.964 --> 17:31.633
<i>This is Judge Oh Jin-ju</i>
<i>from the </i>Live Court Show <i>department.</i>

17:32.342 --> 17:35.220
<i>I know many of our citizens</i>
<i>were left concerned</i>

17:35.304 --> 17:38.307
<i>following the recent terrorist attack</i>
<i>on the Supreme Court.</i>

17:38.390 --> 17:41.268
<i>However, Judge Kang Yo-han</i>

17:41.351 --> 17:43.896
<i>will never succumb to such threats.</i>

17:44.563 --> 17:48.400
<i>Because as you are all aware,</i>

17:48.484 --> 17:50.861
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han is</i>
<i>an extremely strong person.</i>

17:50.944 --> 17:54.031
<i>So please pray for Judge Kang Yo-han</i>

17:54.114 --> 17:57.451
<i>and Judge Kim Ga-on's safe return…</i>

17:57.534 --> 18:00.204
-Who is this woman?
-Judge Oh.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.247
-I work with her and--
-Are you dating her?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.958
What are you on about?
She's just an associate--

18:05.042 --> 18:08.045
-Are you dating her?
-I said, no!

18:08.128 --> 18:10.881
She just tends to exaggerate
and is prone to tears.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.591
-So you're not dating her?
-No!

18:12.674 --> 18:14.843
-You really aren't?
-No!

18:16.345 --> 18:17.513
How boring.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.899
-Why did you bring that thing?
-What thing?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.819
-You mean Ga-on?
-He has a drab name, too.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.029
Get him out of here.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.032
Why? You can't stop minding him?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.702
If you don't kick him out, I'll kill him.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.870
With those legs?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.998
Didn't you say you'd come after me
if you were to ever walk again?

18:45.082 --> 18:48.043
Take one step at a time. Slowly.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.771
Aren't you going after her?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.664
Stay put and don't wander around.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.835
-Is there something I shouldn't see?
-Too much curiosity won't do you any good.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.754
I'm much better now, so I'm going home.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.591
You're much safer here.
We still haven't caught the terrorist.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.260
Then what do you plan to do
about the trial?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.389
I'll find a judge to stand in for you.
Don't you worry.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.268
What?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.770
This is Judge Jung In-seok.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.899
He'll be standing in for Judge Kim
until he fully recovers.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.903
-Nice to meet you, Judge Oh.
-Wow, you look too much like a judge.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.490
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.369
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Yes, sure.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.289
Thank you for taking the courage
to help us out in this crisis.

20:07.372 --> 20:11.585
No, it's an honor to be part
of the <i>Live Court Show</i>. I'll do my best.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.421
That's very reassuring to hear.
Then please excuse me.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.931
-You'll have to do your best.
-Pardon?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.891
Do your best.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.480
Hey, wait!

20:32.397 --> 20:34.107
That's Judge Kim's desk.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.400
Then where should I…

20:37.069 --> 20:38.278
You can take that desk.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.406
Sure.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.369
The live show is just around the corner.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.746
-So let's get to work.
-Yes, ma'am.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.425
I'm sure Master Yo-han
told you to stay put.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.846
I'm too sick
and tired of lying in bed all day.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.848
I'm not Sleeping Beauty, am I?

21:51.977 --> 21:54.938
If you'd like me to,
I could have you sleep all day,

21:55.022 --> 21:56.732
just like Sleeping Beauty.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.109
-Pardon?
-Just kidding.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.654
What kind of a joke is that?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.502
People in this house just won't listen.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.353
We watched it over and over,
but there were no outsiders.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.438
You really are tenacious, Detective.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.194
No matter how many times
I watch this, I see no outsiders.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.614
Could it be
that the offender is an insider?

22:47.866 --> 22:48.867
An insider?

22:50.535 --> 22:51.370
Maybe, yes.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.372
Right?

22:53.455 --> 22:56.124
Judge Kang Yo-han
has become too much of a bigshot.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.585
There could be a judge
who's not so happy with that.

22:58.668 --> 23:02.172
The bomb exploded
from the painting on the wall.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.090
Yes.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.258
What if it wasn't someone
who came to install it,

23:05.759 --> 23:08.387
but that it was installed
in the painting from the beginning?

23:08.470 --> 23:09.930
You mean, to start with?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.351
What's the phone number
of the place that renovated

23:14.434 --> 23:16.269
the department of the<i> Live Court Show</i>?

23:21.066 --> 23:24.653
It seems Detective Yoon Su-hyeon
is onto something.

23:24.736 --> 23:25.695
Don't lose her.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.990
You know it.
We need to get to them before the police.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.677
Can you spare us a minute to talk?

24:32.095 --> 24:33.555
Excuse me.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.348
Darn it. Please!

24:37.684 --> 24:39.394
Let go of him right now.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.313
May I ask where you're from?

24:41.980 --> 24:43.440
We're from the WAIS.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.910
Are you responsible

24:54.993 --> 24:58.121
for the decor of the Judge's Chamber
at the Department of <i>Live Court Show?</i>

24:58.205 --> 24:59.164
Well…

24:59.998 --> 25:01.833
Let me see your account book.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.293
Is that your office?

25:03.376 --> 25:05.128
Let me see your warrant first.

25:08.965 --> 25:12.093
Gosh, I see you must have been in a hurry.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.346
Come back when you have
what you need with you.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.932
I'll be waiting.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.007
Someone's in a good mood.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.350
What the hell?

26:00.433 --> 26:02.185
Now this is an interesting place.

26:03.103 --> 26:07.190
Do furniture factories these days
also handle small explosives such as this?

26:07.816 --> 26:08.900
Damn it…

26:16.116 --> 26:18.326
I almost died back there, you know.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.500
You just walked into your own grave.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.561
Spare me. I'll tell you everything.

26:45.145 --> 26:48.064
Well, too bad.
Because I have nothing to ask you.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.818
I'll tell you everything. Everything!

26:51.901 --> 26:53.903
Geez, you're too chatty.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.081
Spare me. I'll tell you everything.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.375
The Foundation…

27:08.043 --> 27:09.878
It was someone from the Foundation.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.755
They asked me to just scare you.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.633
That's enough.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.179
Judge Kang.

27:27.020 --> 27:31.232
Go tell your master
that they better come see me themselves.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.907
Was that about Judge Kim Ga-on?

28:10.438 --> 28:11.690
I see you stayed put.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.193
Here, a present for being good.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.204
-You're hurt.
-It's nothing.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.421
How are the preparations going
for Lee Yeong-min's trial?

28:35.004 --> 28:37.549
What preparations?
It's just a simple case, isn't it?

28:37.632 --> 28:39.926
As far as I know,
you're the meticulous type.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.136
In many ways.

28:41.219 --> 28:44.848
Well. I'm not quite sure
what you're talking about.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.269
You said there is no such thing
as justice in the real world,

28:49.352 --> 28:51.354
only a terribly skewed game.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.440
So what?

29:05.493 --> 29:07.412
What's your reason for jumping into

29:08.580 --> 29:10.248
a skewed game?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.250
My reason?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.258
Do I have to have a reason?

29:20.341 --> 29:22.719
Is there something
you wish to set straight?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.345
Something you regret, perhaps?

29:26.973 --> 29:28.767
-Are you a boomer?
-Pardon?

29:28.850 --> 29:31.936
You said it's typical of boomers
to judge others.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.190
-That's not--
-Just focus on getting better.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.442
And save your imagination
for something else.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.994
SEARCH WARRANT APPLICATION

29:50.205 --> 29:51.039
Ga-on!

29:51.539 --> 29:53.708
My hearing's just fine, you know.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.251
Hey! Is this time for a joke?

29:55.960 --> 29:56.878
Are you all right?

29:56.961 --> 29:59.047
<i>Are you hurt? Do you have all your limbs?</i>

29:59.547 --> 30:02.133
Two legs, two arms. Am I missing anything?

30:02.217 --> 30:04.219
<i>You must have suffered head injuries.</i>

30:04.302 --> 30:05.512
<i>How is your face?</i>

30:05.595 --> 30:08.264
That's your only strength,
given your nasty character.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.308
-<i>Su-hyeon.</i>
-Yes?

30:10.391 --> 30:12.727
<i>I'm just fine. Were you worried about me?</i>

30:17.315 --> 30:18.733
Are you all right, Su-hyeon?

30:20.735 --> 30:21.653
Where are you now?

30:24.572 --> 30:26.241
-At Kang Yo-han's place.
-What?

30:31.579 --> 30:34.165
But how can you trust the guy?

30:34.707 --> 30:37.877
The place does look safe.
It's secured with all kinds of technology.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.672
The owner is the most dangerous.
What are you saying?

30:40.755 --> 30:43.049
<i>That terrorist attack</i>
<i>could have been his own doing too.</i>

30:43.132 --> 30:44.175
Then again, yeah…

30:44.884 --> 30:47.303
<i>He did try and scare me into staying put.</i>

30:47.387 --> 30:48.596
You get out of there now.

30:50.598 --> 30:52.851
Since I'm in the tiger's den,
I should look around.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.978
<i>There's hardly anything known about him.</i>

30:55.061 --> 30:57.647
<i>-His family, his upbringing and such.</i>
-Ga-on.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.233
I'll look into it.
I'll look into everything,

31:00.316 --> 31:01.526
<i>so don't you do anything.</i>

31:01.609 --> 31:03.653
There you go again, acting like my mom.

31:03.736 --> 31:04.946
No, what I mean is…

31:05.029 --> 31:08.700
You know, my body must still be
in shock because I'm sleepy all day.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.244
But I can't sleep all day, can I?

31:11.327 --> 31:13.580
<i>Anyway, I'll be careful</i>
<i>so don't worry about me.</i>

31:24.632 --> 31:30.221
<i>How long will you continue to ignore</i>
<i>our neighbors on the streets?</i>

31:32.098 --> 31:34.601
<i>For Korea to rise up again,</i>

31:34.684 --> 31:39.022
<i>we need to start</i>
<i>by shedding light on the lowest places.</i>

31:41.399 --> 31:43.401
<i>The Social Responsibility Foundation</i>

31:43.484 --> 31:47.322
<i>is currently building the Dream Base</i>
<i>at the outskirt of Seoul</i>

31:47.405 --> 31:51.868
<i>which will house 30,000 families</i>
<i>who are sick and in need.</i>

31:52.827 --> 31:55.955
<i>It will be a commune that offers</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:58.082
<i>free medical care and free housing.</i>

32:03.379 --> 32:05.381
<i>With everyone's support,</i>

32:06.633 --> 32:09.719
<i>this beautiful dream can become a reality.</i>

32:09.802 --> 32:11.054
<i>So, thank you.</i>

32:14.933 --> 32:17.018
And then he comes on screen!

32:19.187 --> 32:21.564
-It's wonderful.
-That was what I was talking about!

32:21.648 --> 32:24.359
-Exactly!
-That's exactly what I had in my mind.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.944
Just unbelievable.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.740
-It's marvelous.
-Who came up with the concept?

32:31.407 --> 32:33.451
Chairman Seo, I was so touched.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.328
What you did is extremely commendable.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.790
Maybe we can expect to hear
some good news from Sweden this year.

32:38.873 --> 32:39.916
Of course!

32:40.667 --> 32:41.960
Please, gentlemen.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.963
Do you think I'm doing this
for the Nobel Prize?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.965
It's all for the sake of our country.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.722
Please forgive us.
President Park spoke too soon.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.517
You're absolutely right.
This is for our country,

32:57.600 --> 33:00.561
and which is
what brings me to my next point.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.939
Isn't it about time we relocate

33:03.022 --> 33:05.608
the helpless to the Dream Base village?

33:05.692 --> 33:08.111
Yes, you're right.
There are too many homeless

33:08.194 --> 33:11.364
and beggars around Myeong-dong
and Gangnam these days.

33:11.447 --> 33:15.410
That's why your hotel suffered
a serious loss, isn't it?

33:15.493 --> 33:18.162
With no more visitors from overseas.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.499
Well, I guess President Min
or Minister Cha is suffering more than me.

33:21.582 --> 33:24.544
The duty-free shops are in the red,
and as for Minister Cha,

33:24.627 --> 33:26.421
her son is about to be put on trial.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.338
Anyway,

33:27.422 --> 33:31.092
Seoul needs to restore its past glory
to enhance our national prestige.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.094
That will bring back
the foreign investors.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.348
Of course, because that's the way
to restore your wealth, isn't it?

33:39.517 --> 33:41.769
And your approval ratings too,
Mr. President.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.192
If you don't mind me asking,
Mr. President,

33:48.276 --> 33:52.196
the government has been rather sluggish
at their end with the Dream Base project.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.699
They don't listen to you, do they?

33:57.535 --> 34:00.163
We only just managed
to finish the first complex.

34:00.246 --> 34:01.622
There is still a lot to do,

34:01.706 --> 34:04.375
so we can't have the administration
holding us back now.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.838
I'm sure there's a lot that you want.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.840
You want the greenbelt to be opened up,

34:10.923 --> 34:13.134
demolish the slums still standing

34:13.217 --> 34:16.137
at the project site
and evict all its residents…

34:17.722 --> 34:20.767
-Am I correct?
-But that was already all agreed upon.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.352
After all, this project is
to rebuild our nation.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.688
Don't make me laugh.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.274
How is this to rebuild our nation?

34:28.357 --> 34:30.985
Also, why are you raising your voice?
You must have forgotten,

34:31.069 --> 34:33.112
but I was voted by the common people.

34:33.196 --> 34:37.075
The residents at the slums
are my people too!

34:37.158 --> 34:38.993
-That's enough, Honey.
-Hey!

34:39.077 --> 34:40.828
Who are you to cut in?

34:40.912 --> 34:44.248
You should know when and… Damn it!
What was that?

34:44.332 --> 34:45.708
I apologize, Mr. President.

34:45.792 --> 34:49.212
-It was my mistake.
-Are you crazy, Director Jung?

34:49.295 --> 34:51.756
Damn it. I'm all wet!

34:51.839 --> 34:53.049
I'm sorry.

34:53.758 --> 34:57.261
Gosh, even my underpants are wet. Honey?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.180
Where is the napkin?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.433
Damn it!

35:05.812 --> 35:07.105
I'm so frustrated.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.982
Why are they getting so cheeky with me?

35:10.066 --> 35:12.110
I'm not the Heo Jung-se I used to be.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.986
I'm the commander-in-chief!

35:14.070 --> 35:16.322
Do they still think I'm a joke?

35:16.405 --> 35:19.117
Honestly, those vultures!

35:19.200 --> 35:21.202
-Are you all right?
-I'm not all right.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.663
I think you got too worked up.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.540
Go for a massage and get some rest.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.001
-Should I?
-Yes.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.171
Damn it…

35:53.985 --> 35:56.529
Goodness, your neck is extremely stiff.

36:00.074 --> 36:00.908
Director Jung?

36:01.617 --> 36:02.660
One moment.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.621
Let me relax
those muscles up for you first.

36:05.705 --> 36:09.250
That feels good, but why are you…

36:09.333 --> 36:13.171
Before that, do you know anything
about chiropractic and manual therapies?

36:14.922 --> 36:17.216
I'm from the slums.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.720
Before I met Chairman Seo,
there's nothing I haven't done.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.055
I made a living
out of acupressure for some time too.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.267
You're really a mystery.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.270
I was extremely touched earlier.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.774
You care so much
about the powerless in the slums.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.403
Of course.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.866
Would you change your heart
if we increased your share

36:41.949 --> 36:43.910
to 10% of the revenue?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.958
That was very smart, Director Jung.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.337
Oh, I'm just an errand girl.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.714
It's Chairman Seo
who decides on the distribution.

36:56.797 --> 37:00.009
But who else could be so smart
with their message delivery?

37:00.092 --> 37:03.804
Director Jung, you really are something.
Every time I see you, I…

37:10.186 --> 37:11.187
You like it?

37:15.399 --> 37:17.693
What did you say to me just now?

37:18.444 --> 37:20.863
I should relax your facial muscles too.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.949
Oh, my face?

37:23.616 --> 37:24.784
Should we, then?

37:25.826 --> 37:29.497
By the way,
how did you get in here, Director Jung?

37:29.580 --> 37:30.748
How…

37:31.707 --> 37:33.584
I mean, not everyone can…

37:36.671 --> 37:38.214
This isn't a place where anyone…

38:37.606 --> 38:38.649
Master.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.277
I will protect you.

38:42.486 --> 38:43.904
My poor master…

38:45.448 --> 38:46.615
"Master"?

38:47.783 --> 38:49.827
But Kang Yo-han isn't at home right now.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.708
This house is yours,

38:57.293 --> 38:58.919
and not his…

39:31.577 --> 39:32.787
MOTION FOR A SUMMARY ORDER

39:32.870 --> 39:35.790
"The Defendant, Lee Yeong-min,
assaulted the victim, Lee Ji-hun,

39:35.873 --> 39:38.834
by slapping him in the cheek
and punching him in the abdomen…"

39:43.047 --> 39:45.758
Does this Lee Yeong-min
have anger management issues?

39:45.841 --> 39:47.760
Why do such a thing at a restaurant?

39:48.594 --> 39:51.430
I guess he never needed to manage
his anger his entire life.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.099
I mean, why bother?

39:54.183 --> 39:55.726
Ms. Kim Yeon-hui?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.269
Thank you.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.818
Why are we here at such a crummy place?

40:04.443 --> 40:05.528
Yeong-min.

40:05.611 --> 40:09.657
This place was featured on TV
as a good eats place and is super popular.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.909
It's trending, okay?

40:11.992 --> 40:14.286
Sure. You eat up.

40:15.246 --> 40:19.291
Oh man, parking isn't allowed here.
Is the owner of car number 0615 here?

40:20.626 --> 40:22.545
Is the owner of car number 0615 here?

40:23.587 --> 40:26.048
Are you the owner of the car out there?
Thank you.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.259
-Excuse me, but is that your car outside?
-Yes.

40:28.759 --> 40:29.927
Yeong-min, that's your car.

40:30.636 --> 40:32.513
Are you the owner of the car outside?

40:32.596 --> 40:34.890
-What if I am?
-Could you please move your car?

40:34.974 --> 40:35.933
Why?

40:36.016 --> 40:39.895
You're blocking the road
and we'll receive complaints.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.731
-I'm sorry.
-Here.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.775
You move it.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.528
-Pardon?
-I just gave you the key, so you move it.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.198
But I can't just drive your car.

40:52.074 --> 40:54.618
Hey. Can't you see me drinking?

40:54.702 --> 40:57.288
Will you take responsibility
if I'm fined for drunk driving?

40:57.371 --> 40:59.748
-Then maybe…
-Jeez.

41:00.249 --> 41:01.083
Hey.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.710
Are you kidding me right now?

41:03.335 --> 41:07.798
What kind of a place doesn't offer
valet parking these days?

41:07.882 --> 41:11.218
I'm already feeling like shit
because of your shitty place.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.429
Please, just stop it!

41:13.512 --> 41:14.722
Get off me!

41:14.805 --> 41:17.141
Sir, you should really stop.

41:17.224 --> 41:19.185
Sir, you shouldn't just punch
other people.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.561
Oh, I can't?

41:24.064 --> 41:25.691
No, you shouldn't!

41:25.774 --> 41:28.944
So you're going to hit your customer?
Well, go on, you punk!

41:29.028 --> 41:31.780
One of the victims has
a criminal history for assault.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.241
That's why he held back
with all his might.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.494
Please don't do this. Please!

41:37.536 --> 41:38.412
Why?

41:38.496 --> 41:41.248
You need money too, do you?
Then here's a piece of me!

41:43.042 --> 41:44.251
That's enough already!

41:44.335 --> 41:45.669
Why?

41:45.753 --> 41:47.421
Why should I stop?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.548
Hey, why do you keep telling me to stop?

41:49.632 --> 41:52.384
It just starting to get fun.
Don't you think so?

41:52.468 --> 41:55.721
-What, it's not? But it is!
-You spiteful man…

41:55.804 --> 41:58.933
They must have been truly upset.
He attempted many times to settle it,

41:59.016 --> 42:01.185
but they all refused.
They were very adamant about it.

42:01.268 --> 42:03.729
All three victims
had come together on that one.

42:03.812 --> 42:04.980
Yes, Minister.

42:15.407 --> 42:17.159
Chief Justice.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.553
-Hello?
<i>-Am I speaking to Mr. Kim Seong-hun?</i>

42:35.636 --> 42:39.056
-Yes, this is he.
-This is the Prosecutor's Office.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.437
<i>-We'll need you to come in.</i>
-About what?

42:45.521 --> 42:48.399
<i>You were questioned</i>
<i>over assault in the past, weren't you?</i>

42:48.482 --> 42:50.150
I was already penalized for that.

42:50.234 --> 42:53.112
Well, it's up to us to decide
whether or not it is closed.

42:53.195 --> 42:54.071
What?

42:54.154 --> 42:55.072
We received a report

42:55.155 --> 42:57.199
that the investigation
wasn't quite complete.

42:57.283 --> 42:59.535
So come in. Do you understand?

43:19.805 --> 43:21.640
<i>Kang Yo-han's family register?</i>

43:21.724 --> 43:23.976
Yes, there's got to be something.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.644
<i>Can you look into it?</i>

43:26.395 --> 43:27.896
Well…

43:28.772 --> 43:30.816
There aren't any allegations
against him right now.

43:30.899 --> 43:33.360
<i>-So I'm not sure if that'll be possible.</i>
<i>-</i>Right?

43:33.444 --> 43:34.820
<i>Still, I'll try and see.</i>

43:34.903 --> 43:36.947
-Thanks, Su-hyeon.
<i>-Sure.</i>

43:37.031 --> 43:37.906
<i>Bye.</i>

44:24.244 --> 44:25.829
Here are the documents.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.081
Thank you.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.836
What? Again?

44:35.005 --> 44:37.257
Another written agreement
for private settlement?

44:38.592 --> 44:42.554
We received one from the hall manager
and today, it's from the part-timer.

44:42.638 --> 44:43.889
"All disputes were settled.

44:43.972 --> 44:46.975
I no longer wish for the offender
to receive criminal penalties." What?

44:47.851 --> 44:51.480
But she even wrote a letter demanding
Lee Yeong-min be severely punished.

44:52.439 --> 44:54.775
And now she's gone
and sent us a pardon letter,

44:54.858 --> 44:56.568
just before the day of the trial?

44:58.404 --> 45:01.990
The Defendant must have
really shown remorse this time.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.703
He must've offered his heartfelt apologies
for her to change her mind like this.

45:08.747 --> 45:10.999
-Excuse me, rich boy.
-Yes?

45:11.083 --> 45:13.544
You think this world is
a beautiful place, don't you?

45:14.920 --> 45:16.255
What do you mean, exactly…

45:16.839 --> 45:18.716
Those with power
never reflect on their actions.

45:18.799 --> 45:20.926
That's only for the powerless.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.387
All right?

45:24.888 --> 45:26.515
Yes.

45:33.188 --> 45:34.440
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

45:34.523 --> 45:35.816
I'm sorry.

45:35.899 --> 45:37.901
No worries. Why should you be sorry?

45:37.985 --> 45:39.236
Let me handle it.

45:39.319 --> 45:42.281
Will you go to the trial tomorrow?

45:44.199 --> 45:45.242
I'll have to.

45:47.536 --> 45:48.662
To be honest with you…

45:49.538 --> 45:52.791
I wouldn't be this upset right now
if I had beaten the hell out of him.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.585
If I had, I would have given up.

45:54.668 --> 45:56.462
But I can't live like this.

45:56.545 --> 45:59.214
I might die of frustration!

45:59.298 --> 46:00.382
But Chef…

46:01.842 --> 46:03.677
It's all right. You aren't at fault.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.262
But Chef!

46:10.225 --> 46:12.478
I'm worried about you, Judge Kang.

46:13.771 --> 46:17.232
To challenge the Prosecution head-on
in a time like this, is--

46:17.316 --> 46:18.192
Chief Justice.

46:19.401 --> 46:22.321
Do you believe
that all are equal before the law?

46:24.364 --> 46:27.159
Well… But why do you ask?

46:27.242 --> 46:28.577
Because I don't.

46:29.536 --> 46:32.956
It's just as cheeky as saying
Santa will visit on Christmas Day.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.959
Still, don't you find yourself
wanting to believe in

46:36.043 --> 46:37.461
such white lies, once in a while?

46:37.544 --> 46:39.087
Look, Judge Kang.

46:39.171 --> 46:43.342
Just consider this trial
as a Christmas special.

46:44.927 --> 46:45.928
Oh, and…

46:46.887 --> 46:49.807
Please tell them
they won't need to worry about me.

47:39.356 --> 47:40.858
Why are you up so early today?

47:40.941 --> 47:43.068
You'd normally sleep in until noon.

47:43.151 --> 47:44.945
Lee Yeong-min goes on trial today, right?

47:45.445 --> 47:47.030
Are you going to cheer for me?

47:47.114 --> 47:50.617
There's not much evidence for this case,
so if you ever need a witness…

47:51.702 --> 47:53.287
What, did you see something?

47:54.121 --> 47:55.998
I saw him on road rage.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.710
Did you?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.171
Anything else, perhaps?

48:04.965 --> 48:05.924
Hey!

48:14.391 --> 48:17.311
Save your concerns about the trial
and focus on getting better.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.462
You've waited long, everyone.

48:43.545 --> 48:45.130
The <i>Live Court Show</i> is back,

48:45.213 --> 48:47.966
<i>after delays</i>
<i>due to an unfortunate accident.</i>

48:48.050 --> 48:50.802
<i>I'm looking forward to</i>
<i>what sensational verdicts</i>

48:50.886 --> 48:52.346
<i>will be delivered this time.</i>

48:52.429 --> 48:55.098
Well, let's now get started
on our second trial.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.352
Please give a big hand, everyone!

49:06.735 --> 49:08.403
<i>Before we commence today's trial,</i>

49:08.987 --> 49:11.323
<i>I have an announcement</i>
<i>for all our citizens.</i>

49:11.907 --> 49:13.951
Unfortunately, Judge Kim Ga-on

49:14.034 --> 49:17.204
will not be able to join us today.

49:17.287 --> 49:18.330
What the…

49:18.413 --> 49:22.084
<i>Please pray</i>
<i>for Judge Kim's return in good health.</i>

49:22.167 --> 49:23.961
He needs your support.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.672
What's with the exaggeration?

49:26.755 --> 49:30.801
Some may not want
these trials to continue.

49:31.635 --> 49:34.346
Among them may be
a good number of powerful people.

49:35.430 --> 49:37.683
So you, my fellow Koreans

49:38.725 --> 49:40.602
are the only ones who can protect us.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.648
We're for you, Judges! Hang in there!

49:54.700 --> 49:57.077
DEFENDANT

50:03.625 --> 50:06.962
This court is now in session.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.213
DEFENDANT, LEE YEONG-MIN

50:08.296 --> 50:10.674
Our Defendant today was indicted

50:10.757 --> 50:14.011
for randomly inflicting
physical assault and verbal abuse

50:14.094 --> 50:16.138
on a restaurant chef and its hall staff.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.391
Mr. Lee Yeong-min,
may I ask you to step forward?

50:19.891 --> 50:21.560
DEFENDANT

50:23.812 --> 50:25.022
Mr. Lee Yeong-min?

50:28.191 --> 50:29.609
Please come forward.

50:30.777 --> 50:33.405
But why?

50:35.741 --> 50:37.200
PROSECUTOR

50:45.000 --> 50:46.168
Your Honor.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.670
Yes, Prosecutor.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.422
Before we continue,

50:50.505 --> 50:52.799
there are some things
I must remind everyone.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.510
Is there? You may speak.

50:55.594 --> 50:58.764
As you are already aware,
this is a simple assault case.

50:58.847 --> 51:02.893
It's an offense unpunishable
over objection, in other words.

51:02.976 --> 51:06.354
If all victims have submitted
a pardon letter,

51:06.438 --> 51:08.857
the Prosecution has no choice
but to cancel the arraignment.

51:08.940 --> 51:12.152
But isn't there still one victim
who is yet to settle privately?

51:13.236 --> 51:14.863
Are you referring to this man right there?

51:21.828 --> 51:23.497
Please come to the witness stand.

51:28.293 --> 51:29.377
Have a seat.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.590
Do you have anything to say?

51:39.846 --> 51:41.056
I do not wish…

51:43.350 --> 51:44.935
for Defendant to be penalized.

51:54.402 --> 51:55.362
NAME, KIM SEONG-HUN

51:55.445 --> 51:57.197
I REQUEST YOU
SEVERELY PUNISH LEE YEONG-MIN

51:57.280 --> 51:59.449
-Mr. Kim Seong-hun?
-Yes.

51:59.533 --> 52:03.245
You'd written many letters requesting
severe punishment against the Defendant.

52:03.328 --> 52:04.162
Yes, Your Honor.

52:05.580 --> 52:07.999
May I ask why you had a change of heart?

52:08.083 --> 52:09.000
I just…

52:11.211 --> 52:13.380
-I just want all of this to end.
-Why so?

52:15.173 --> 52:18.135
Ma'am. What is it that you can't tell me?

52:18.218 --> 52:20.720
There's something going on, isn't there?

52:22.347 --> 52:24.182
-The building's been sold.
-What?

52:24.266 --> 52:28.061
This entire building's been sold
to some company.

52:28.145 --> 52:31.648
But why this old building,
in the middle of nowhere?

52:31.731 --> 52:34.609
-They're going to demolish it.
-What? And build a new one?

52:34.693 --> 52:38.613
No, they'll just demolish it. I guess
they're going to keep it as an empty lot.

52:39.739 --> 52:42.826
So they want us to leave
before our lease expires.

52:42.909 --> 52:46.496
That means you'll be driven out
without receiving a penny for the premium!

52:47.164 --> 52:50.208
-Could this be, perhaps--
-I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.670
<i>In life,</i>

52:53.753 --> 52:56.506
you see all sorts of things happen.

52:59.259 --> 53:02.220
It's not like I was hurt,
so I'll just forget it ever happened.

53:02.304 --> 53:03.180
Is that right?

53:07.392 --> 53:10.562
Since all victims no longer
wish to go forward with this case,

53:10.645 --> 53:15.108
the Prosecution has no choice
but to cancel the arraignment, Your Honor.

53:15.817 --> 53:18.695
Oh, and Your Honor.

53:20.280 --> 53:23.158
May I have some time to…

53:23.742 --> 53:24.743
Well…

53:28.788 --> 53:30.165
I'm sorry.

53:44.846 --> 53:46.306
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

53:52.145 --> 53:53.605
Oh gosh.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.774
I'm sorry.

53:58.652 --> 54:01.112
I announce this case dismissed, then.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.031
-Prosecutor.
-Yes, Your Honor.

54:05.659 --> 54:08.620
What was the word for people
who repeat the same actions?

54:10.121 --> 54:12.415
I'm not sure where you're coming from.

54:12.499 --> 54:16.753
Didn't they teach you at law school
about habitual offenders?

54:17.963 --> 54:21.967
Are you perhaps referring to recidivists?

54:22.467 --> 54:24.803
Simple assault is not penalized
if parties settle privately.

54:24.886 --> 54:27.013
But does the same hold
for repeat assaults?

54:27.681 --> 54:29.683
Well, no…

54:29.766 --> 54:33.311
However, there is no evidence
to prove that the Defendant is a repeat--

54:33.395 --> 54:37.023
How many assault cases were dropped
after he settled with the victims?

54:37.107 --> 54:39.359
A total of 12 cases, Your Honor.

54:39.442 --> 54:41.361
-Yes, that's--
-Is it not enough?

54:41.444 --> 54:45.282
The Prosecution these days are going out
of their way to guarantee human rights.

54:46.658 --> 54:48.118
It's very commendable.

54:48.201 --> 54:49.494
You may resume your seat.

54:58.336 --> 55:00.839
-Then why not ask the people?
-Pardon?

55:00.922 --> 55:03.133
My fellow citizens
who are with us for this trial.

55:03.216 --> 55:06.219
Do you, perhaps,
find the Defendant familiar?

55:07.012 --> 55:09.639
Zoom in on Lee, now! More!

55:11.224 --> 55:13.184
Your Honor, may I ask what you're--

55:13.268 --> 55:16.938
On the Dike app that you've downloaded,
you should find a "Send Video" button.

55:18.315 --> 55:21.318
If you find the Defendant familiar,
please let us know.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.492
I'll give you 10,000 won for that.

55:30.577 --> 55:31.911
-It's a good price.
-Thanks.

55:31.995 --> 55:33.747
-You're here.
-Yes.

55:33.830 --> 55:34.748
Careful.

55:34.831 --> 55:36.374
-Let me weigh that now.
-Sure.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.461
-Hey, good to see you.
-Thanks.

55:39.544 --> 55:41.171
-Go take a break.
-All right.

55:49.888 --> 55:50.847
Hey, that's…

55:54.476 --> 55:56.186
Hey. What's this?

55:57.771 --> 55:59.689
Producer, we have an informant.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.566
-Should we connect?
-Yes, go for it.

56:03.193 --> 56:04.778
<i>Hey, we're connected!</i>

56:04.861 --> 56:07.572
<i>Oh what? Is this airing live</i>
<i>all across the nation?</i>

56:07.655 --> 56:09.783
Yes, we can see you very well.
Please continue.

56:10.658 --> 56:14.037
<i>Hello, Judge Kang! I'm a big fan of yours.</i>

56:14.120 --> 56:15.705
<i>You're truly awesome.</i>

56:15.789 --> 56:17.999
My friends and I have been
raving about you.

56:18.083 --> 56:20.418
Thank you. So…

56:21.086 --> 56:23.254
have you seen the Defendant before?

56:23.338 --> 56:24.964
<i>Oh, I know that crazy bastard…</i>

56:25.048 --> 56:26.925
<i>Oops, I'm on air.</i>

56:27.592 --> 56:29.803
<i>Anyway, that man is a total psycho.</i>

56:29.886 --> 56:32.430
<i>I used to work part-time</i>
<i>for valet service at a department store.</i>

56:34.974 --> 56:37.519
<i>-You know, this.</i>
-Yes, and?

56:37.602 --> 56:41.564
<i>Well, he suddenly got out of his car</i>
<i>and started yelling about the traffic line</i>

56:41.648 --> 56:43.608
<i>and he even kicked one of the staff.</i>

56:43.691 --> 56:47.320
<i>When I rushed over in shock,</i>
<i>he slapped me asking who the hell I was.</i>

56:49.781 --> 56:54.119
<i>But the department store told us</i>
<i>to just let it go because he's VVIP.</i>

56:54.619 --> 56:56.913
<i>Honestly, I was so frustrated and angry.</i>

56:57.914 --> 56:58.957
Hey!

56:59.040 --> 57:00.417
That crazy…

57:02.752 --> 57:05.171
Would you be okay
giving us this testimony?

57:06.005 --> 57:07.757
<i>Yes, it's fine.</i>

57:07.841 --> 57:09.426
<i>I got fired anyway.</i>

57:10.885 --> 57:14.139
Objection, Your Honor. This case wasn't
even officially investigated--

57:14.222 --> 57:18.435
Could you tell the police
about all that had happened at that time?

57:18.518 --> 57:21.563
<i>Of course! My blood had been boiling.</i>

57:21.646 --> 57:23.815
<i>Please punish him. Please!</i>

57:28.736 --> 57:29.863
<i>He is a regular at our bar,</i>

57:29.946 --> 57:32.240
<i>and he beats up our staff</i>
<i>every time he comes here.</i>

57:32.323 --> 57:35.493
<i>He'll beat you and kick you</i>
<i>if he thinks you're below him.</i>

57:35.577 --> 57:36.870
<i>That's just not on, is it?</i>

57:36.953 --> 57:40.165
<i>Recently, there was an incident</i>
<i>with a girl who'd only just joined us,</i>

57:40.248 --> 57:43.168
<i>and she ended up in tears</i>
<i>and I had to just…</i>

57:43.251 --> 57:45.712
<i>I mean, do I have to</i>
<i>keep putting up with this?</i>

57:45.795 --> 57:48.756
<i>Every time he doesn't like something,</i>
<i>he starts beating everyone.</i>

57:48.840 --> 57:51.634
<i>It's not like he ever pays them</i>
<i>to go to the doctor,</i>

57:51.718 --> 57:53.386
<i>or has his insurance cover it.</i>

57:53.470 --> 57:56.848
<i>I don't care even if I get fired for this.</i>
<i>I'm ready to divulge everything.</i>

57:56.931 --> 57:58.558
<i>There are just so many episodes.</i>

57:58.641 --> 58:01.436
-<i>Our valet parker…</i>
-That bastard…

58:01.519 --> 58:04.564
<i>The valet parker, he…</i>

58:05.148 --> 58:07.108
<i>He's old enough to be his father.</i>

58:07.192 --> 58:12.447
<i>Yet he'd kick him in the shin,</i>
<i>and does as he pleases…</i>

58:19.913 --> 58:21.164
<i>Last month, he came to our store</i>

58:21.247 --> 58:23.458
<i>and made a scene,</i>
<i>demanding we change the screen.</i>

58:23.541 --> 58:25.126
<i>When I told him we can't do that,</i>

58:25.210 --> 58:27.712
<i>he pushed me onto the ground</i>
<i>and started to stomp on me.</i>

58:27.795 --> 58:29.130
<i>I was shocked and stopped him</i>

58:29.214 --> 58:32.258
<i>but he then proceeded to smash</i>
<i>all the monitors in our store.</i>

58:32.342 --> 58:33.760
<i>He said I'm no one to stop him.</i>

58:33.843 --> 58:36.095
<i>He clearly said</i>
<i>he'd pay me handsomely for it.</i>

58:36.179 --> 58:40.099
<i>-In his yellow convertible…</i>
<i>-It's appalling.</i>

58:40.183 --> 58:42.894
<i>I was on my bicycle crossing the road,</i>

58:42.977 --> 58:44.646
<i>when all of a sudden…</i>

58:50.443 --> 58:51.569
This was why.

58:53.863 --> 58:55.532
This is why he did an open trial.

58:57.909 --> 59:00.078
Just what are you scheming here?

59:47.417 --> 59:49.127
It's like a Christmas tree.

59:50.128 --> 59:55.008
So, my fellow Koreans.
How should we punish a man like him?

59:56.801 --> 1:00:00.263
A trial is a game.
Fail to serve evidence, and you lose.

1:00:06.019 --> 1:00:09.772
INNOCENT, GUILTY

1:00:10.815 --> 1:00:11.816
Yes, it's going up…

1:00:11.899 --> 1:00:14.319
Yes! Three million!

1:00:14.986 --> 1:00:16.195
We've done it!

1:00:19.949 --> 1:00:23.244
Is this still not enough
to prove his recidivism?

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:28.124
This Court requests the Prosecution
to modify the indictment.

1:00:28.207 --> 1:00:31.794
This case is not a simple assault,
but a habitual assault.

1:00:31.878 --> 1:00:35.006
For this purpose,
we will continue with the trial.

1:00:36.215 --> 1:00:37.717
I suggest you hurry.

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:41.095
If you take too much time, all this fury
may be directed at the Prosecution next.

1:00:44.098 --> 1:00:46.309
-Mr. Kim Seong-hun.
-Yes, Your Honor.

1:00:46.392 --> 1:00:49.646
Habitual assault is punishable,
even if pardoned by the victim.

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:52.774
Your case will be considered
for this trial too.

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:54.525
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:00:58.655 --> 1:01:01.616
I will see to it
that no case is overlooked.

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:04.744
Because justice
cannot be bought with money.

1:01:09.332 --> 1:01:10.375
Get the crowd's reaction!

1:01:22.136 --> 1:01:26.265
What's your reason
for jumping into a skewed game?

1:01:26.349 --> 1:01:27.183
My reason?

1:01:28.518 --> 1:01:30.186
Do I have to have a reason?

1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:33.189
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>you wish to set straight?</i>

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:35.650
Something you regret, perhaps?

1:03:33.893 --> 1:03:36.646
Aren't you a curious Sleeping Beauty?

1:03:43.778 --> 1:03:45.029
Who is this person?

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:50.368
Who is he?

1:03:56.999 --> 1:03:58.209
Master Yi-sak.

1:03:59.043 --> 1:04:01.462
-Yi-sak?
-The older brother of Master Yo-han,

1:04:01.546 --> 1:04:03.214
Master Yi-sak.

1:04:04.382 --> 1:04:07.134
And the rightful heir to this mansion.

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:16.060
He's Kang Yo-han's brother?

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:22.400
Then are you telling me
he lived in this basement?

1:04:22.984 --> 1:04:24.652
-No.
-Then what?

1:04:24.735 --> 1:04:25.862
This was…

1:04:28.781 --> 1:04:32.243
This was Master Yo-han's room.

1:04:32.326 --> 1:04:33.160
What?

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:39.709
Master Yo-han was an abandoned child.

1:04:41.294 --> 1:04:43.212
<i>He was a child whom no one wanted.</i>

1:04:46.507 --> 1:04:48.384
<i>Kang Yo-han was abandoned?</i>

1:04:48.467 --> 1:04:51.804
Then are you saying he wasn't born
into this family? Tell me more.

1:04:51.888 --> 1:04:54.390
It's Kang Yo-han whom I'm suspecting.

1:04:54.473 --> 1:04:57.977
I already know
that he's capable of doing the extremes.

1:04:58.060 --> 1:05:01.022
He already has a record
of doing so since primary school.

1:05:01.105 --> 1:05:03.649
So it wasn't just simple curiosity, I see.

1:05:04.650 --> 1:05:06.736
Then why not look into it more yourself?

1:05:11.282 --> 1:05:13.284
This house is yours,

1:05:14.035 --> 1:05:15.995
and not his…

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:20.082
I'm sure this Yi-sak
probably lacked something.

1:05:21.417 --> 1:05:22.460
What did you say?

1:05:22.543 --> 1:05:25.630
There's no way a family like this
would have left their entire wealth

1:05:25.713 --> 1:05:27.798
to someone who's not their bloodline…

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:32.803
Perhaps Kang Yo-han was more qualified.

1:05:32.887 --> 1:05:33.930
What would you know?

1:05:39.852 --> 1:05:40.686
I'm sorry.

1:05:48.819 --> 1:05:50.863
If it's too hard for you,
you don’t need to tell me.

1:05:53.115 --> 1:05:54.492
I see a strong resemblance.

1:05:56.202 --> 1:05:57.286
Especially your eyes.

1:05:58.871 --> 1:06:02.959
Master Yi-sak lost his mother
at a young age.

1:06:04.168 --> 1:06:08.631
After losing his wife,
President Kang holed up in his house

1:06:08.714 --> 1:06:11.842
and it all began
when his friends called him out to a bar.

1:06:12.593 --> 1:06:15.513
The president was drunk
and slept with a barmaid one day.

1:06:15.596 --> 1:06:16.889
<i>She came to the house</i>

1:06:16.973 --> 1:06:20.810
<i>and demanded money,</i>
<i>claiming she was pregnant with his child.</i>

1:06:22.228 --> 1:06:23.729
<i>She was turned away, so…</i>

1:06:29.777 --> 1:06:31.028
Dad…

1:06:49.046 --> 1:06:50.339
Dad.

1:09:04.473 --> 1:09:05.599
Father!

1:09:26.996 --> 1:09:28.247
<i>President Kang.</i>

1:09:28.330 --> 1:09:30.749
<i>Why do you treat Master Yo-han so?</i>

1:09:36.589 --> 1:09:38.465
You can kick me out, if you wish.

1:09:38.549 --> 1:09:40.342
But what has the child done wrong?

1:09:44.221 --> 1:09:45.556
<i>Because he's just like me.</i>

1:09:46.265 --> 1:09:47.558
<i>He's…</i>

1:09:48.392 --> 1:09:50.019
too much like me.

1:09:57.151 --> 1:09:58.527
But Yi-sak…

1:10:01.906 --> 1:10:03.115
Yi-sak is different.

1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:10.998
<i>One day, Yo-han will swallow</i>
<i>his brother whole.</i>

1:10:12.291 --> 1:10:16.253
Then why are you suspecting
Kang Yo-han too, ma'am?

1:10:17.379 --> 1:10:18.505
I'm not sure what you mean.

1:10:18.589 --> 1:10:20.925
You said Master Yi-sak
was the rightful heir.

1:10:21.008 --> 1:10:24.762
That's suggesting
Kang Yo-han robbed his place unrightfully.

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:27.806
Do you have evidence?

1:10:27.890 --> 1:10:30.434
-To suspect Kang Yo-han?
-There's no such thing.

1:10:31.185 --> 1:10:35.397
But according to what you just said,
he's just a victim of abuse by his father.

1:10:35.481 --> 1:10:37.733
And the child I nursed.

1:10:38.442 --> 1:10:40.861
However, Master Yo-han was a child
who was capable

1:10:40.945 --> 1:10:43.364
of doing whatever he wished,
from long before then.

1:10:44.031 --> 1:10:45.783
Just as you said so yourself.

1:10:45.866 --> 1:10:47.159
So why?

1:10:47.243 --> 1:10:49.536
He made the maid who fancied him

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:51.664
jump from the second storey,

1:10:51.747 --> 1:10:56.085
and fed herbicide
to President Kang's favorite hunting dog.

1:11:17.690 --> 1:11:20.484
<i>The Social Responsibility Foundation</i>

1:11:20.567 --> 1:11:24.154
<i>is currently building the Dream Base</i>
<i>on the outskirts of Seoul</i>

1:11:24.238 --> 1:11:29.326
<i>which will house 30,000 families</i>
<i>who are sick and in need.</i>

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:38.377
<i>Did he have a reason?</i>

1:11:39.128 --> 1:11:41.255
<i>Maybe something had gotten on his nerves,</i>

1:11:42.047 --> 1:11:43.966
<i>or it could have been just a prank.</i>

1:11:45.342 --> 1:11:46.218
<i>However,</i>

1:11:47.219 --> 1:11:49.638
<i>what child would go to such lengths?</i>

1:11:49.722 --> 1:11:51.140
<i>And without hesitation too.</i>

1:12:07.197 --> 1:12:08.157
Who are you?

1:12:09.158 --> 1:12:10.284
It's been a long time.

1:12:14.538 --> 1:12:15.831
Don't you remember me?

1:12:19.877 --> 1:12:21.837
You…

1:12:23.505 --> 1:12:24.340
You're that…

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:26.425
The cathedral.

1:12:27.718 --> 1:12:28.844
The fire…

1:13:00.793 --> 1:13:02.878
Still, you said his brother, Yi-sak,

1:13:02.961 --> 1:13:05.547
was good to Kang Yo-han.
And that they got along.

1:13:05.631 --> 1:13:06.757
Or am I wrong?

1:13:08.008 --> 1:13:11.011
Did you hear that Master Yo-han was…

1:13:11.095 --> 1:13:12.888
I said, don't come near me!

1:13:12.971 --> 1:13:14.348
<i>…a survivor of a fire disaster?</i>

1:13:15.349 --> 1:13:16.183
<i>Yes.</i>

1:13:16.892 --> 1:13:19.603
<i>The incident happened only a month</i>
<i>after President Kang's death.</i>

1:13:20.813 --> 1:13:24.691
And Master Yi-sak perished
in that same fire.

1:14:16.743 --> 1:14:18.412
I see you didn't sell this.

1:14:20.914 --> 1:14:22.291
Did you like it that much?

1:14:24.793 --> 1:14:27.421
Help…

1:14:37.139 --> 1:14:41.101
THANK YOU TO JOO SEOK-TAE
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:15:08.754 --> 1:15:10.964
<i>Does it have to be Cha Gyeong-hui?</i>

1:15:12.466 --> 1:15:13.675
<i>For the next presidency…</i>

1:15:13.759 --> 1:15:15.177
<i>Excuse me. What are you…</i>

1:15:16.970 --> 1:15:19.723
<i>Tell me.</i>
<i>What happened exactly in this house?</i>

1:15:19.806 --> 1:15:22.392
How do you think Yo-han became
the master of this house?

1:15:23.143 --> 1:15:25.771
Do you remember the fire that broke out
at a cathedral ten years ago?

1:15:25.854 --> 1:15:28.232
What did you find out, Ga-on?

1:15:28.315 --> 1:15:30.943
What is it that you want from me?
Is it power? Or authority?

1:15:31.026 --> 1:15:32.611
<i>What kind of cruelty is this?</i>

1:15:32.694 --> 1:15:33.570
<i>It's fun.</i>

1:15:33.654 --> 1:15:35.614
Is that why you killed your brother too?

1:15:35.697 --> 1:15:38.116
Say that again. Again!

1:15:39.451 --> 1:15:44.414
