What? Me, Bender the robot?

00:45.380 --> 00:46.965
There's metal

like ass flakes.

02:15.053 --> 02:18.056
my golf clubs to pound
dents out of the ship.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.641
I didn't bend
your golf club.

02:19.724 --> 02:22.852

it, it'll be over your head.

his ass with my toothbrush.

(GASPS) Lies!
He's justjealous

02:50.296 --> 02:52.715

who's lying, my friend.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.596
Because I planted a spy
camera in our apartment!

to last night while I was asleep.

use your toothbrush.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.424

change the subject.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.385

also planted a spy camera

that living.

Yep.

What did the violence solve?

Enough of this foolishness!

set up a spy camera

might as well get to know the team.

I don't know.

hundreds of trust falls

not do that.

I like to demonstrate

06:41.986 --> 06:45.907
the power of trust by finding a
perfect stranger to be my assistant.

Hmm. Just don't drop me off on an
asteroid like the last guy did.

trust a total stranger,

you can sure as heck
trust your own coworkers.

first trust fall of the week,

arms of my new assistant.

had a panic room.

come in handy, like, 5O times.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.471
We'll be safe in here.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.182

and we have enough food

08:35.265 --> 08:37.977
and board games to
survive for weeks.

my autobiography?

Now hold on. There may be a
slim chance of survival.

We'll have to split
into three teams.

crawl through the air vents

so we can steer
the ship from here.

spacewalk onto the hull

What's the square

I unpolish it with sandpaper.

business at Princeton.

change shape.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.977
Yes, he is
a shape-shifter.

But he uses his shape-shifting
for team-building, not evil.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.066
He pretends to
eat some people.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.525

to work together.
