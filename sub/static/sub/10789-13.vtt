19:30.834 --> 19:32.125
We should set them up.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.708
Hah. Yeah, right.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.417
You laugh. I'm serious.

19:35.417 --> 19:36.417
Yeah. I laugh.

19:36.417 --> 19:38.208
'Cause Uncle Bill, he's, uh...

19:39.417 --> 19:40.792
He's not like most people.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.125
So, neither is my Grams.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.417
She's a freak. She's
a thoroughly lovable freak,

19:45.417 --> 19:46.625
But she's a freak, nonetheless.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.834
Oh, come on, it would be fun.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.625
I call my Grams,
you talk to your Uncle Will.

19:50.625 --> 19:51.417

19:52.000 --> 19:53.167

19:55.209 --> 19:55.875
Hey.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:57.875 --> 19:58.959
Thank you.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.125
You know,
maybe you should try this.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.208
I'm not gonna shake my ass
just to get a ride.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.625
I didn't say you had to,

20:05.625 --> 20:07.083
but if you felt it was
important to the task,

20:07.708 --> 20:08.875
well, that would be ok, too.

What are we gonna do?

20:13.708 --> 20:14.875
I mean, this is ridiculous.

20:15.250 --> 20:18.125
You try to help someone,
your car gets stolen,

20:18.125 --> 20:19.250
and you're stuck on
the side of the road

20:19.250 --> 20:20.208
with someone who hates you.

20:21.209 --> 20:22.917
I don't hate you, Eddie, ok?

20:22.917 --> 20:24.333
It's just, this wasn't the plan.

20:24.333 --> 20:28.083
I mean, we're supposed to be
over, you and me, done. Kaput.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.083
Ah, I see,
so you're saying it's not over.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.875
I don't want to talk about that.
I want to talk about Audrey.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.250
Fine. Let's talk about Audrey.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.750
I can't figure out
how to help her.

20:42.167 --> 20:43.792
I mean, I keep trying
all different angles,

20:43.792 --> 20:45.125
but nothing seems to work.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.708
Eddie: You can't help her, Jo.

That girl doesn't want
anyone's help.

You're probably right.

20:52.792 --> 20:54.125
I'm just having a hard time
letting her go.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.084
I mean, you know,
believe it or not,

20:57.167 --> 20:57.959
she wasn't this psycho.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.291
I mean, yeah,
she's always been psycho,

20:59.291 --> 21:01.084
but in a good way.

21:01.875 --> 21:05.250
Well, you're a good friend.
I mean, that's why you're here.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.125
That's what friends do
for each other, right?

21:08.375 --> 21:09.542
What are you getting out of it?

21:10.000 --> 21:10.959
Isn't that obvious?

21:11.917 --> 21:13.250
I get to spend
some time with you.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.125
I don't know about
the whole friend thing.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.041
Maybe Audrey's right.

21:22.291 --> 21:23.250
What do you mean?

21:24.041 --> 21:25.500
Well, she thinks that...

21:26.084 --> 21:27.834
This road trip
isn't about her at all.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.125
It's really about me.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.084
Ok. How does that work?

letting you go, too.

21:41.625 --> 21:44.417
which I know, it's, it's stupid
and really sad, actually,

because you've made it painfully
clear how you feel about me.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.792
And yet, I'm just
prolonging the inevitable,

21:50.209 --> 21:51.208

21:53.417 --> 21:54.375
Well...

21:55.333 --> 21:58.333
I guess I haven't made it clear
how I feel about you.

21:58.834 --> 22:00.417
This is probably gonna sound,

22:02.167 --> 22:03.208
gonna sound cheesy, but...

22:04.875 --> 22:08.458
I've never cared about anyone
the way I care about you.

It did sound cheesy.

leaving them behind.

Well, I never wanted you

23:11.375 --> 23:13.166
to puke your guts out
over all this.

23:13.708 --> 23:14.917
Well, I guess
that's what happens

23:14.917 --> 23:16.083
when you watch your
entire life's ambition

23:16.083 --> 23:17.291
disappear in front of your eyes.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.291
Look, you've directed
before, right?

23:21.291 --> 23:23.792
Yeah, but it didn't bear the
slightest
resemblance to this experience.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.041
Exactly. You're not back home

with your silly little friends.

Don't tell me you're one
of those religious broads.

24:46.417 --> 24:49.291

as religious, yes,

if you would not refer to me
as a broad.
