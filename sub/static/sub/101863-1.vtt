Oh, I'm alive.

I'm alive!

01:08.794 --> 01:09.753
Oh!

01:30.399 --> 01:31.525
- Hi.
- Oh, my god.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.694
You still work
for this old fool?

01:33.736 --> 01:36.155
Good to see you, too,
Chrissy.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.200
- Hey, Oswald.
- Hello, Terry...

01:39.242 --> 01:40.367
Jason.

01:40.409 --> 01:41.952
We've met, like,
fifteen times.

01:41.994 --> 01:42.953
- Bunch of times.
- Yeah.

01:42.995 --> 01:44.038
It's good to
see you again.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.956
So, I have some
bad news for you guys.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.166
- Oh...
- I'm sorry to say

01:47.208 --> 01:48.834
that the doctors
did all they could,

01:48.876 --> 01:50.794
but you should
say your goodbyes.

01:50.836 --> 01:53.130
Children.

01:53.172 --> 01:56.800
Hey, dad.
Hey, buddy.

01:56.842 --> 01:58.928
Look, I know this is
probably a bad time,

01:58.969 --> 02:02.556
but I just wanted you to know
that I'm totally ready

02:02.598 --> 02:04.975
to take over the company,
uh, if you don't,

02:05.017 --> 02:07.436
um... live.

02:07.477 --> 02:09.312
Dad?

02:12.858 --> 02:15.444
Oh, hi, oh,
you poor thing.

02:15.485 --> 02:19.115
You've been grooming me
my entire life for this moment,

02:19.156 --> 02:21.825
and I'm ready to
take over the company.

02:21.867 --> 02:22.868
Wait, I'm sorry.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.287
I just said
that I would do that.

02:24.328 --> 02:26.205
You don't even know
what the company does.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.749
Chrissy.

02:28.791 --> 02:30.167
You're my oldest.

02:30.209 --> 02:31.210
Favorite.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.462
- He didn't say favorite.
- He implied.

02:33.503 --> 02:37.466
Oswald, my son.

02:37.507 --> 02:38.467
Less favorite.

02:38.508 --> 02:40.427
- Male heir.
- Hmm.

02:40.469 --> 02:44.140
I haven't decided yet who's
gonna take over the company.

02:45.808 --> 02:48.102
There's something
I haven't told you.

02:48.144 --> 02:52.982
Come close.

02:53.023 --> 02:55.651
I have another child.

02:55.692 --> 02:57.611
- What?
- What?

02:59.738 --> 03:01.657
Balr...

03:04.701 --> 03:06.245
Beaur...

03:11.792 --> 03:13.460
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

03:13.502 --> 03:15.129
- Bora?
- That is very loud.

03:15.171 --> 03:16.380
Bora?

03:16.421 --> 03:18.257
<i>Beauregard Davis Jackson.</i>

03:18.299 --> 03:20.968
<i>That's me
and I am a winner.</i>

03:21.010 --> 03:23.012
<i>But it wasn't
always that way.</i>

03:23.053 --> 03:24.847
<i>Actually, this is the
end of the movie.</i>

03:24.888 --> 03:26.890
<i>Let's go back
to the beginning.</i>

03:27.432 --> 03:29.643
<i>That's little me
racing a motorbike</i>

03:29.685 --> 03:31.603
<i>I built out
of spare parts.</i>

03:31.645 --> 03:33.605
<i>Guess who won
the semifinals?</i>

03:33.647 --> 03:35.983
<i>I did!
Look at that!</i>

03:36.025 --> 03:37.484
<i>And there's my best friends,</i>

03:37.526 --> 03:38.527
<i>Mandy and Noodle,</i>

03:38.568 --> 03:39.945
<i>cheering me on.</i>

03:39.987 --> 03:43.699
<i>Oh, yeah, and that's
Mandy's cousin Eskandar.</i>

03:43.740 --> 03:46.202
<i>All I had to do is
win one more race</i>

03:46.243 --> 03:47.786
<i>and I'd be the champion.</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:51.332
Nothing could possibly
go wrong now.

03:51.374 --> 03:52.791
Oh, come on.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.252
<i>My fuckin' clutch cable
broke in half.</i>

03:55.294 --> 03:58.339
If it's broke
then I'm done.

03:58.381 --> 03:59.756
<i>Then there's Tommy.</i>

03:59.798 --> 04:01.217
<i>He's one of my friends.
He's got cool hair.</i>

04:01.258 --> 04:02.759
<i>He tried to give me
a clutch cable,</i>

04:02.801 --> 04:04.511
- <i>but his dad...</i>
- Hey, hold on there, son.

04:04.553 --> 04:05.721
<i>Well, he had
a different idea.</i>

04:05.762 --> 04:08.098
That clutch cable
cost ten dollars.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.808
I don't have any money.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.518
Well, if I'm gonna be
stuck paying for it,

04:11.560 --> 04:14.938
my boy here is gonna
ride in the finals.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.857
<i>So, I fixed it.</i>

04:16.899 --> 04:19.651
<i>I let Tommy ride
my bike and, of course,</i>

04:19.692 --> 04:22.196
<i>he won on the bike I built.</i>

04:24.823 --> 04:27.576
<i>And that's where I learned
a very valuable lesson.</i>

04:27.617 --> 04:30.537
<i>Tommy was a winner because
he had money and a dad</i>

04:30.579 --> 04:34.166
<i>and I was a loser because
I was broke and fatherless.</i>

04:49.514 --> 04:50.849
<i>That's my tractor.</i>

04:50.891 --> 04:52.726
<i>I built her from
the tires up.</i>

04:52.768 --> 04:54.686
<i>She's about to
complete a full pull.</i>

04:54.728 --> 04:56.646
<i>Red, white,
and blue, baby!</i>

04:56.688 --> 04:57.981
Whoo!

04:58.023 --> 05:00.525
<i>But that's not me.
That's Tommy.</i>

05:00.567 --> 05:02.945
<i>Yep, same Tommy.</i>

05:02.986 --> 05:05.530
<i>Big mullet,
even bigger asshole.</i>

05:05.572 --> 05:08.533
<i>Ever since he won that race
when we were kids.</i>

05:09.785 --> 05:11.454
We are
looking at a pull-off

05:11.495 --> 05:13.330
to settle this one,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:13.372 --> 05:17.251
<i>And there's me, grease monkey
and Tommy's head mechanic.</i>

05:17.293 --> 05:21.171
<i>But this scratcher here
could pay me $8,000!</i>

05:23.048 --> 05:25.842
<i>But, of course,
it did not.</i>

05:25.884 --> 05:27.261
Both
drivers have 20 minutes

05:27.303 --> 05:28.845
to report for the final pull.

05:28.887 --> 05:30.680
<i>This is my best bud Noodle.</i>

05:30.722 --> 05:33.392
<i>People think he's slow,
but I think he's well-paced.</i>

05:33.434 --> 05:35.602
<i>He has a condition
called IBS,</i>

05:35.644 --> 05:37.604
<i>but mostly
it's just diarrhea.</i>

05:38.772 --> 05:40.065
What'd I miss?

05:40.107 --> 05:42.859
Tommy and Flint are
centered on a pull-off.

05:42.901 --> 05:45.654
- He's gotta race again?
- Yep.

05:45.695 --> 05:48.991
Well, it sounded like the
valves were sticking.

05:49.032 --> 05:50.617
I'll get the engine cleaner.

05:53.329 --> 05:56.790
Where in the goddamn hell
have you taken us?

05:56.832 --> 05:59.168
This is where
Phineus' other son works.

05:59.209 --> 06:01.337
Oh, can-can
you not call him that?

06:01.378 --> 06:02.587
What, his son?

06:02.629 --> 06:05.299
Yeah, I just... I'm used
to being his only son,

06:05.341 --> 06:06.300
so it's weird.

06:06.342 --> 06:07.926
Well, he's got
another son now.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.262
He's got two sons.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.515
I could fire you.

06:12.556 --> 06:13.640
No, you really can't.

06:13.682 --> 06:15.225
I've been assigned
to execute the will.

06:18.312 --> 06:19.438
Fine. Fine.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.772
Well, can we just
get on with it

06:20.814 --> 06:22.525
so that we can get
the hell out of here?

06:22.566 --> 06:25.486
Yes, yes, uh, this
is the next bit here.

06:25.528 --> 06:27.154
Does the guy get
the company or what?

06:27.196 --> 06:28.738
It's more complicated
than that, all right?

06:28.780 --> 06:29.781
It's spelled out in steps.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.033
Well, what are they,
Jason?

06:31.074 --> 06:32.701
I don't know!
All I have is this,

06:32.742 --> 06:34.453
this challenge
for his son.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.662
- Uh, you did it again.
- Sorry.

06:35.704 --> 06:37.998
Give me that paper!
Give me the paper.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.124
I'm gonna handle this.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.667
Well, wait. Hold on!
I've gotta...

06:42.919 --> 06:44.505
Okay, Noodle,
rev the engine!

06:47.007 --> 06:49.134
Noodle, rev the...

06:49.176 --> 06:50.302
What are...

06:56.016 --> 06:57.726
Good God in heaven!

06:59.936 --> 07:01.897
What's she doing?

07:01.938 --> 07:03.106
I dunno.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.361
- Is she...
- No!

07:10.072 --> 07:11.198
She's comin' right at us.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.657
What did you do?

07:12.699 --> 07:13.576
Nothing.

07:13.617 --> 07:15.035
Act natural.
Act natural!

07:21.208 --> 07:23.377
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hello there, Miss.

07:23.419 --> 07:25.295
Can I help you
with something?

07:25.337 --> 07:28.382
I'm looking for the driver
of this monstrosity.

07:28.424 --> 07:30.426
That would be me.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.843
- You're the driver?
- Yeah, that's right.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.262
We've got a pull-off
in about ten minutes

07:33.303 --> 07:37.433
if you wanna stick around
and watch me pull off.

07:37.474 --> 07:42.271
I don't know what
the fuck that means.

07:42.312 --> 07:43.647
Who's he?

07:43.688 --> 07:46.816
Well, he's an idiot
and my mechanic.

07:46.858 --> 07:49.027
Well, he's who
I'm here to see.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.196
Okay, wait a minute now.
You need a mechanic?

07:51.238 --> 07:53.490
Because I'm actually
pretty handy with a tool.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.246
Ew, get the fuck
out of my way.

07:59.288 --> 08:01.123
Get the fuck
out of my way!

08:01.164 --> 08:04.042
Beauregard Davis Jackson?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.169
Yes, that is my name.

08:06.211 --> 08:08.130
Do you know who
your father was?

08:09.506 --> 08:13.176
Sore subject, but, uh, no,
I never met my father.

08:13.218 --> 08:16.346
Do you know who
Phineus Davis is?

08:16.388 --> 08:18.140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:18.181 --> 08:20.725
He plays a guitar for this,
uh, Drooling Banjos

08:20.767 --> 08:21.935
over at McNeer's.

08:21.977 --> 08:25.021
Oof, fuck no.
You do this.

08:25.063 --> 08:28.024
Well, you gave it your
college try, didn't you?

08:28.066 --> 08:30.735
Hi, Mr. Jackson, my name
is Jason Wilmore.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.655
I'm one of
Phineus Davis' attorneys.

08:32.696 --> 08:34.490
You have soft hands.

08:34.530 --> 08:38.159
Oh, I, um, I use
a lot of lotion.

08:38.201 --> 08:39.160
Thank you.

08:39.202 --> 08:40.828
- You say you're a lawyer?
- Yes.

08:40.870 --> 08:42.331
Okay.

08:42.371 --> 08:44.791
Everyone was drunk that night,
especially the band.

08:44.833 --> 08:46.209
Yeah... No, no, no.

08:46.251 --> 08:48.795
Phineus Davis didn't play
guitar in some local band.

08:48.837 --> 08:51.674
He was one of the richest
men in the world

08:51.715 --> 08:54.217
and he died two days ago.

08:54.259 --> 08:55.218
Well, I didn't kill him,

08:55.260 --> 08:56.512
if that's what
you're getting at.

08:56.553 --> 09:00.807
No one thinks you
killed him, Mr. Jackson.

09:00.849 --> 09:02.434
He was your birth father

09:02.476 --> 09:05.521
and he may have left you
some money in his will.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.317
Well, okay.
All right!

09:10.359 --> 09:12.402
Yeah, I'll take it,
uh, in a check,

09:12.444 --> 09:14.070
or maybe small bills.

09:14.112 --> 09:15.238
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.407
It's a little more
complicated than that.

09:17.449 --> 09:18.617
He wrote this
letter to you.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.702
Can I read it?

09:19.743 --> 09:22.037
No, I can read it myself.

09:22.078 --> 09:24.873
I know how to read.

09:24.914 --> 09:27.710
Dear Beauregard, I have
been following your life

09:27.751 --> 09:30.337
and I think you have
grown into a fine man.

09:30.379 --> 09:31.921
Your mother and I shared
a wonderful night

09:31.963 --> 09:34.466
in the Pinkie Pizza Arcade
many years ago.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.843
You were conceived either
on the Pop-A-Shot machine

09:36.885 --> 09:38.094
or in the ball pit.

09:38.136 --> 09:40.138
Probably a Pop-A-Shot.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.684
He could hit like
20 free throws in a row.

09:43.726 --> 09:44.851
Good to know.

09:44.893 --> 09:47.020
Either way, it was
a glorious beginning.

09:47.062 --> 09:49.606
I am sorry that
I abandoned you,

09:49.648 --> 09:51.816
but I can now make it
all up to you

09:51.858 --> 09:53.902
as long as you prove
that you have what it takes

09:53.943 --> 09:54.903
to be a winner.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.279
What the hell is this?

09:56.321 --> 09:59.241
It means you have
to win, you know?

09:59.282 --> 10:03.495
Just maybe keep reading,
unless you need a break.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.414
Your first task is to get
in that driver's seat

10:05.455 --> 10:06.623
where you are now,

10:06.665 --> 10:08.500
win a tractor pull event
as the driver,

10:08.542 --> 10:09.668
and you will begin
your journey.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.463
Do me proud, son.
Your father, Phineus.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.507
I'm supposed to win
a tractor pull event?

10:15.549 --> 10:18.719
Well, you have to get in
the driver's seat now.

10:18.761 --> 10:22.514
So, you have to win this
tractor pull, today.

10:25.183 --> 10:26.142
Hey, uh, Tommy?

10:26.184 --> 10:28.478
No! No fuckin' way!

10:28.520 --> 10:30.439
- But...
- Bu-bu-but...

10:30.480 --> 10:31.856
I don't give
a good googley shit

10:31.898 --> 10:33.650
about all this, okay?

10:33.692 --> 10:35.485
I'm the driver.
You're the fixer.

10:35.527 --> 10:36.570
End of discussion.

10:40.365 --> 10:41.784
Okay.

10:41.825 --> 10:43.076
So, that's it then?

10:43.118 --> 10:44.286
Yeah, I'm sorry,
Mr. Lawyer,

10:44.327 --> 10:47.831
but, uh, yeah,
yeah, that's it.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.874
You don't want to maybe
offer this guy a...

10:49.916 --> 10:51.794
Hey, buddy, why don't you
let them get back to work?

10:54.671 --> 10:55.714
Yeah.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.842
Well, I guess
we are done here then.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.051
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Jackson.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.094
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

11:01.136 --> 11:03.806
Yeah, thanks
for playing, Toolbox.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.181
You're...
do you have to...?

11:06.725 --> 11:08.310
Well, you boys want
to get your dick-beaters

11:08.351 --> 11:10.895
out of your little assholes
and get back to work?

11:10.937 --> 11:13.565
Finish this baby up
so I can go to the pull off.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.358
Now, I'm gonna
go help you guys out

11:15.400 --> 11:16.693
and lighten the load.

11:19.362 --> 11:20.656
That was a colossal
waste of time.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.324
Can we just get the hell
out of here?

11:22.365 --> 11:25.452
He's not going to drive
the tractor, so let's go.

11:25.494 --> 11:29.164
Well, I have to make sure.

11:29.205 --> 11:30.791
Fine.

11:30.833 --> 11:34.586
So, if we're staying,
can I get a corndog?

11:38.757 --> 11:40.008
That was wild, huh?

11:40.049 --> 11:42.135
Yeah, whatever.

11:42.177 --> 11:44.471
Well, it sounds like you
only gotta win one race,

11:44.513 --> 11:47.098
and you could win
a lot of money.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.225
What am I supposed to do,
kill Tommy?

11:49.267 --> 11:52.145
You don't have to kill him
to stop him from racing.

11:52.187 --> 11:53.856
Well, then what
would you suggest?

11:56.232 --> 11:57.442
Bo...

12:00.362 --> 12:01.613
The green one's
his precious.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.366
I know he's in there.

12:04.407 --> 12:05.784
You sure this will fit?

12:05.826 --> 12:08.704
I know these shitters
like the back of my hand.

12:08.745 --> 12:09.788
It'll fit.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.997
Yeah, but what
if someone comes behind

12:11.039 --> 12:12.374
and lets him out?

12:12.415 --> 12:15.960
I thought of that.
Read this sign.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.921
Oh.

12:17.962 --> 12:19.172
Did you draw that?

12:19.214 --> 12:21.633
- Yeah.
- Well, shit with a shovel.

12:21.675 --> 12:22.967
That's pretty good.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.135
Thanks.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.396
Oh...

12:34.437 --> 12:36.690
Oh, that hurt.

12:42.404 --> 12:44.113
Nope, nope, take it easy,
take it easy.

12:44.155 --> 12:46.324
Let her come to you.
Let her come to you.

12:54.457 --> 12:56.919
Don't go anywhere.
Bo's racing in the pull off.

13:01.631 --> 13:04.509
Oh, holy shit!

13:04.551 --> 13:06.344
That is a trophy winner
right there.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.804
You can do this, Bo.

13:07.846 --> 13:10.557
You know this tractor
better than Tommy does.

13:10.599 --> 13:13.435
Plus, we built this engine
from scratch.

13:13.476 --> 13:15.353
What did Flanderson pull?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.731
- 185 feet.
- 185 feet!

13:17.773 --> 13:18.941
That's...
That's nothin'.

13:18.982 --> 13:20.650
This machine
can crush that.

13:20.692 --> 13:22.026
With a double load?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.780
Don't worry about that.
You've got this.

13:24.821 --> 13:26.322
Yeah, I got this.

13:26.364 --> 13:27.490
You're the man!

13:27.532 --> 13:28.784
I'm the man.

13:28.825 --> 13:30.535
Folks, we have
a replacement driver

13:30.577 --> 13:31.703
for the final pull.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.455
Hey, somebody
open this door!

13:33.496 --> 13:34.497
Sitting in for Tommy Mullin

13:34.539 --> 13:35.958
is local bastard child
Bo Jackson.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.960
Oh, god! Oh, shoot,
was that your foot?

13:38.001 --> 13:39.294
I'm sorry.

13:39.335 --> 13:42.255
Oh, my god.
Oh...

13:42.297 --> 13:44.967
All right, so this is,
uh, called, I think,

13:45.008 --> 13:46.718
the final pull.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.970
They already did
one before,

13:48.011 --> 13:50.430
and then he has to
go longer than the guy

13:50.472 --> 13:52.223
that just finished,
I think.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.643
Oh, my god,
I could give a shit.

13:54.684 --> 13:56.770
- I'm just trying to...
- Would you shut up?

13:56.812 --> 13:58.021
I thought you wanted to...

13:58.062 --> 13:59.898
Like I could literally
give a shit. Shut up!

13:59.940 --> 14:00.941
Putting your mechanic

14:00.983 --> 14:02.943
in the driver's seat
for a pull off.

14:02.985 --> 14:04.736
I hear my tractor!

14:04.778 --> 14:06.571
I ain't seen
nothing like that before.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.698
Hey!

14:22.086 --> 14:23.463
What the fuck
just happened?

14:23.505 --> 14:24.798
I have no idea.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.966
You sons of bitches!

14:29.260 --> 14:30.929
Agh! Oh, shit!

14:30.971 --> 14:31.847
It's official, folks!

14:31.888 --> 14:33.598
That bastard
pulled 196 feet.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.935
- I guess he won then.
- That's a new pull-off record.

14:36.977 --> 14:37.894
Huh!

14:45.568 --> 14:46.611
Now, let's hear it
one more time

14:46.653 --> 14:48.488
for today's big winner,
Bastard Jackson.

14:50.740 --> 14:52.034
Here I am!

14:52.075 --> 14:53.785
Just look at
those dance moves, people.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.037
<i>I thought this was</i>

14:55.078 --> 14:56.454
<i>the greatest moment
of my life.</i>

14:56.496 --> 14:57.706
<i>I was wrong.</i>

14:57.747 --> 14:59.624
<i>A whole bunch of shit's
about to happen.</i>

14:59.666 --> 15:02.002
Please tell me that my dad
is not leaving the company

15:02.044 --> 15:04.253
to some redneck who
won a tractor race

15:04.295 --> 15:05.672
with only one tractor
in it.

15:05.714 --> 15:07.340
No, no, no, no.
It's not over.

15:07.382 --> 15:09.551
There's a lot more
to do it seems.

15:09.592 --> 15:12.012
All right, apparently
he has to podium in

15:12.054 --> 15:15.598
four different racing events
over the next three weeks

15:15.640 --> 15:18.351
all around the country.

15:18.393 --> 15:20.478
That may be
the dumbest fucking thing

15:20.520 --> 15:22.981
I've ever heard.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.775
Super dumb.

15:25.817 --> 15:29.654
And each podium finish
is worth $5,000.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.156
But if you can stand on
the podium in all four events,

15:32.198 --> 15:34.826
the reward will be more
than you can even imagine.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.245
Well, I can imagine
a whole fuckin' lot.

15:37.286 --> 15:41.624
Well, it is, honestly,
a whole f-in' lot.

15:41.666 --> 15:42.792
Huh...

15:42.834 --> 15:44.920
You know, there is
a motocross event in,

15:44.961 --> 15:47.005
uh, Whitefield that we
can go to next Saturday.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.464
No, no.
No, wait, wait.

15:48.506 --> 15:49.966
You have to, um...
here, can you...

15:50.008 --> 15:51.551
Um, just... I'll hold this.

15:51.593 --> 15:54.470
Mr. Davis' instructions here.

15:54.512 --> 15:56.264
This is, uh...
You put your thumb...

15:56.305 --> 15:57.306
put your thumb
on that reader

15:57.348 --> 15:59.225
on that side like this,
like I am.

15:59.267 --> 16:00.894
I'm not putting
my thumb on there.

16:00.936 --> 16:03.897
That's-that's the only way
to get the information.

16:03.939 --> 16:05.273
Nothing's written
on my thumb.

16:05.314 --> 16:06.816
It's your...
no, your print.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.192
Everyone has a unique...
just put...

16:08.234 --> 16:10.278
if you would just put
it there, I... I swear.

16:10.319 --> 16:11.863
I've seen that on "Cops".

16:15.951 --> 16:18.954
What just happened?

16:18.995 --> 16:20.122
That was so cool.

16:22.457 --> 16:23.959
Wheatland?
What is that?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.002
Wheatland, that's
your first destination.

16:26.044 --> 16:27.587
I'm guessing there's
more instructions.

16:27.629 --> 16:29.213
If you'll open
the envelope, we'll see.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.758
I can't be driving
all the way to Missouri.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.136
Bo, it's five grand
if you get to the podium.

16:34.177 --> 16:36.638
Yeah, but it's no grand
if I don't.

16:36.679 --> 16:40.142
I mean, how am I supposed
to get there anyway?

16:40.183 --> 16:43.145
What if we took mom...
I mean Mandy's RV?

16:43.186 --> 16:46.106
Noodle, we cannot afford to
just go driving around America.

16:46.148 --> 16:49.067
Well, it does come with
$100 a day for you

16:49.109 --> 16:51.194
and $100 for anyone
on your team.

16:51.235 --> 16:52.946
Yeah, we probably did
just lose our jobs

16:52.988 --> 16:55.406
locking him in
that portable bathroom.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.659
What happened now?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.577
Looks like we're going
to Wheatland!

16:59.619 --> 17:00.578
Oh, wait.

17:00.620 --> 17:04.373
We gotta get
a team name first.

17:04.415 --> 17:05.916
Uh, you're Bo.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.752
Yeah.

17:07.794 --> 17:12.464
- And you're Noodle.
- I'm Noodle.

17:12.507 --> 17:14.009
Bo-No?

17:14.050 --> 17:16.344
Team Bono?

17:16.385 --> 17:17.762
- No, that's that singer.
- That's a singer.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.430
That's a singer.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.974
- Team Bena...
- Ba-no-do?

17:22.017 --> 17:23.726
- Butthole.
- Boner?

17:23.768 --> 17:25.770
- Boovie.
- Boodle?

17:25.811 --> 17:27.021
Boodle?

17:27.063 --> 17:28.522
Well, shit yeah,
that's it!

17:28.564 --> 17:31.609
- Team Boodle!
- Team Boodle!

17:32.986 --> 17:34.237
Let's go get Mandy.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.615
Well, they are
interesting guys.

17:39.367 --> 17:40.660
Go fuck yourself.

17:42.453 --> 17:45.456
Eloquent, as always, I see.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.582
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

17:46.624 --> 17:48.376
- Hi.
- What'd I miss?

17:48.417 --> 17:49.878
Uh, kinda everything.

17:49.919 --> 17:52.922
Okay.

17:52.964 --> 17:54.298
We'll just go
back there, okay.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.466
I need a hot dog
right now!

17:55.508 --> 17:58.511
- Order up!
- All right.

17:58.553 --> 17:59.762
All right,
have a nice day.

17:59.804 --> 18:01.014
<i>This is Mandy.</i>

18:01.056 --> 18:02.473
<i>She grew up to be
really pretty.</i>

18:02.515 --> 18:04.600
<i>She also grew up to be
Noodle's stepmom</i>

18:04.642 --> 18:07.770
<i>when Noodle's dad decided
to marry the babysitter.</i>

18:07.812 --> 18:10.190
All right, Mandy,
here you go!

18:10.232 --> 18:11.941
<i>And, uh, that's
Mandy's cousin, Eskandar.</i>

18:11.983 --> 18:13.609
You're probably not used
to holding this much meat

18:13.651 --> 18:14.986
in your little hands.
Here you go.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.738
Hey, Mandy.

18:16.779 --> 18:17.864
What are you
doing here, Noodle?

18:17.906 --> 18:19.532
I told you never
bother me at work.

18:19.574 --> 18:21.117
Bo and I need
to borrow your RV.

18:21.159 --> 18:23.452
Oh, hi, Bo.

18:23.494 --> 18:25.205
How's it going, Mandy?

18:25.247 --> 18:27.415
Where y'all
going in an RV?

18:27.456 --> 18:28.791
We gotta go to Missouri.

18:28.833 --> 18:32.254
Oh, hell no! Y'all ain't
taking my rig to Missouri.

18:32.295 --> 18:35.298
We're getting paid
$100 a day each.

18:35.339 --> 18:36.925
Are you running
drugs, Noodle?

18:36.966 --> 18:38.218
- No.
- Well, forget it.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.303
I need my rig to get back
and forth to work.

18:40.344 --> 18:41.971
Skanner, give
me those beef chips!

18:42.013 --> 18:42.972
Hold your horses!

18:43.014 --> 18:45.058
Hey, Mandy,
I've got an idea.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.685
If you join our team,
then you can come

18:47.727 --> 18:49.353
and you get
$100 a day, too.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.521
A hundred dollars a day?

18:50.563 --> 18:51.773
- Yeah.
- For me?

18:51.814 --> 18:53.691
He said $100 a day for
each person on my team.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.319
So if you're on the team,
then you get $100.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.528
All right, let's go.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.155
Eskandar, we quit.

18:59.197 --> 19:01.199
- We quit?
- Yeah, come on.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.951
I just... I have to get
this back to them.

19:07.163 --> 19:08.331
Hey!

19:08.414 --> 19:10.208
Mr. Lawyer!

19:10.250 --> 19:12.168
Now that we're
going to Missouri,

19:12.210 --> 19:13.795
what do we do next?

19:13.836 --> 19:15.630
I don't know.
All right?

19:15.671 --> 19:16.756
Take this.

19:16.798 --> 19:18.216
The instructions are
in there I'm sure.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.093
Okay.

19:20.135 --> 19:21.261
Keep your panties on.

19:23.054 --> 19:24.680
Oh, my god.
Let's go.

19:24.722 --> 19:27.309
Oh, wait, you're not
coming with us.

19:27.350 --> 19:28.643
What are
you talking about?

19:28.684 --> 19:30.812
Well, someone has to keep
an eye on those idiots!

19:30.853 --> 19:32.147
Well, I don't have a car.

19:32.188 --> 19:34.274
No, not in a car.

19:34.316 --> 19:35.942
You're gonna
ride with them.

19:35.984 --> 19:37.235
Oh, no, no.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.112
Not in that hunk of junk.

19:39.154 --> 19:41.614
Jason...

19:41.656 --> 19:44.284
You like working
for this company, right?

19:44.326 --> 19:45.576
Yeah.

19:45.618 --> 19:48.079
Well, your boss is dead.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.748
Do you want to work
for those rednecks

19:50.790 --> 19:53.209
or do you want
to work under me?

19:53.251 --> 19:56.796
You keep an eye on them
and then I'll take care of you

19:56.838 --> 19:58.714
when I take over
the company.

20:00.925 --> 20:02.760
Hop to, bitch.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.470
That kinda hurts.

20:04.512 --> 20:06.639
- Get in.
- Oww! My nachos!

20:08.975 --> 20:10.810
Um...

20:10.852 --> 20:12.603
Could maybe
Oswald be the...

20:16.941 --> 20:18.734
- What do you want?
- Hey, Beauregard.

20:18.776 --> 20:19.861
Um, funny thing.

20:19.902 --> 20:21.904
It turns out that
I'm supposed to, uh,

20:21.946 --> 20:23.323
ride along with you guys.

20:23.365 --> 20:24.699
You can't ride with us.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.742
No, it's just for the will.
To keep an eye on you.

20:26.784 --> 20:28.995
- Who's got our money?
- I do.

20:29.037 --> 20:30.121
Oh, well then come on in!

20:30.163 --> 20:31.122
- Okay.
- Get in here!

20:31.164 --> 20:32.748
Thank you.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.168
Oh, my god.

20:35.210 --> 20:37.795
Welcome, welcome!
Home sweet home.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.588
All right, I'm gonna have
to get my shots.

20:39.630 --> 20:40.798
There's some tequila
up there.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.883
No, not that kind of shot.

20:41.924 --> 20:43.426
Like a-a
vaccination against...

20:43.467 --> 20:44.719
What's that?

20:44.760 --> 20:46.221
It's where the government
tries to control you

20:46.262 --> 20:47.763
through your bloodstream.

21:01.527 --> 21:05.073
Hey, uh, professional legal guy,
this is our crew.

21:05.114 --> 21:06.949
Mandy, she's my stepmom.

21:06.991 --> 21:08.117
Wait, with your what?

21:08.159 --> 21:10.036
She looks like she's
the same age as you.

21:10.078 --> 21:12.621
Yeah, I know.
We all grew up together.

21:12.663 --> 21:15.958
Uh, she was my babysitter,
then my mom.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.878
Actually, Mandy and I
went to prom together.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.004
Yeah, show him
the picture.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.297
No, I don't need
to see that.

21:21.339 --> 21:22.631
No, that's... okay.

21:22.673 --> 21:24.592
I had it printed out
at Walmart.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.094
That's the two of us
right here.

21:26.135 --> 21:28.096
That's me, that's her.

21:28.137 --> 21:30.306
I... I recognize you.

21:30.348 --> 21:33.435
The theme was
Thong Song of the Sea.

21:33.476 --> 21:36.145
That was our song.
Thong Song of the Sea.

21:36.187 --> 21:37.397
That was our jam.

21:37.439 --> 21:38.689
That's not the song name.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.649
There's a popular song
by Sisqo?

21:40.691 --> 21:41.776
Yeah, no, I know,
Thong Song.

21:41.817 --> 21:42.985
It's not "of the sea."

21:43.027 --> 21:44.362
♪ Thong-thong-thong-thong ♪

21:44.404 --> 21:45.696
There's no by
the sea part.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.823
Hey, lawyer,
when do we get paid?

21:47.865 --> 21:49.158
I'll give it to you
when we stop.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.534
No! I want it now!

21:50.576 --> 21:52.287
What are you gonna do
with it? We're driving.

21:55.581 --> 21:56.749
Oh!

21:56.791 --> 22:00.420
Please do not do that.

22:00.462 --> 22:01.712
Do what, this?

22:04.548 --> 22:05.758
Oh, holy god!

22:07.093 --> 22:08.719
- That's not funny.
- Yeah, it is.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.221
No, I could get
seriously hurt.

22:10.263 --> 22:12.515
"I could get
seriously hurt."

22:12.556 --> 22:15.143
- "I could get seriously hurt."
- "I could get seriously hurt."

22:15.184 --> 22:16.269
That is not what
I sound like.

22:16.311 --> 22:17.270
That's exactly
what you sound like.

22:17.312 --> 22:18.271
No, it is not!

22:18.313 --> 22:19.272
I'm pretty good
at impressions.

22:19.314 --> 22:20.273
- Yeah, he is.
- Not of me!

22:20.315 --> 22:21.524
- Poor baby.
- Yeah, "not of me!"

22:21.565 --> 22:24.193
No, no, that
doesn't sound...

22:24.235 --> 22:26.237
I am not gonna die
in this RV.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.614
Hey, Mandy,
he bruised his vagina!

22:28.656 --> 22:30.074
Can I please sit here?

22:30.116 --> 22:31.909
Sure.
You want a chip?

22:31.951 --> 22:34.162
No, I don't want a chip.
I want to live.

22:36.038 --> 22:37.248
Hey, mom.

22:37.290 --> 22:40.084
Noodle, you know I hate
when you call me that.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.544
How fast are we
going, mom?

22:43.129 --> 22:44.755
Fast enough.

22:44.797 --> 22:48.050
It sounds like
we're going about 45.

22:48.092 --> 22:50.636
Right you are,
45 exactly.

22:50.678 --> 22:53.181
How did you know that?

22:53.222 --> 22:55.599
I'm an engine whisperer.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.851
That's a thing?

22:56.892 --> 22:58.311
Mm-hmm, it's
a God-given gift.

22:58.353 --> 23:00.313
Ever since he
was a little guy.

23:00.355 --> 23:02.857
- I got big ears.
- Mandy, speed up!

23:02.898 --> 23:04.359
We're not going to
get there on time

23:04.400 --> 23:05.234
if you don't drive faster.

23:05.276 --> 23:06.902
I'm going as
fast as I can!

23:06.944 --> 23:08.154
Come on, Eskie,
you get in there.

23:08.196 --> 23:09.322
- Me?
- No!

23:09.364 --> 23:10.532
- No, no, no!
- Get in there, get in there!

23:10.573 --> 23:13.326
- No, no, no, we're fine.
- It's my RV! My RV!

23:15.619 --> 23:16.745
No one's at the wheel!

23:16.787 --> 23:17.788
It's fine, it's fine.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.041
I hate you!

23:20.082 --> 23:21.792
- Hands off! Hands off!
- I can drive myself!

23:21.834 --> 23:23.127
Jesus! Oh, my...

23:23.169 --> 23:24.337
- We're all good.
- That is...

23:24.379 --> 23:25.505
That was really
not safe.

23:25.547 --> 23:27.340
It's fine.
They do it all the time.

23:27.382 --> 23:29.175
Oh, you're about
to see not safe.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.512
Whoo!

24:00.081 --> 24:02.375
Okay.
Here we go.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.420
Drum roll, please.

24:09.006 --> 24:10.674
Ah, shit!

24:10.716 --> 24:12.093
- What is it?
- Oh, no!

24:12.134 --> 24:13.052
I got a paper cut!

24:13.094 --> 24:14.762
Oh, just put
some Crisco on it.

24:14.803 --> 24:16.013
- No!
- Run it under water.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.723
Just give me
a minute, okay?

24:17.765 --> 24:18.724
Just give me a minute.

24:18.766 --> 24:19.683
Kiss it.

24:20.643 --> 24:23.062
- Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh, come on!

24:23.104 --> 24:25.481
Let me see.
Let me see!

24:25.523 --> 24:26.649
I think I need stitches.

24:26.690 --> 24:27.816
Oh, my god!

24:27.858 --> 24:29.360
It's a paper cut.

24:29.402 --> 24:30.736
Who cares, right?

24:30.778 --> 24:33.989
Can we just move on?
Open the letter.

24:34.031 --> 24:35.074
Wow!

24:35.116 --> 24:36.284
What is wrong with you?

24:36.325 --> 24:38.327
You are mean!

24:38.369 --> 24:40.455
Yeah, man.
Have a little compassion.

24:40.496 --> 24:41.414
It's serious.

24:41.456 --> 24:42.998
It's a paper cut.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.126
In 60 seconds he's not even
going to remember it happened.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.753
This is not something
you forget.

24:47.795 --> 24:50.590
This is something
that happened to me.

24:50.632 --> 24:52.467
Oh, yeah?
What hand is it on?

24:52.508 --> 24:56.178
Well, I feel like it
was over here.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.013
Yeah, it was your right hand
'cause you're a righty.

24:58.055 --> 25:00.015
No, I was holding it
with my right hand.

25:00.057 --> 25:01.684
- Oh...
- It was that hand.

25:01.725 --> 25:03.018
We should reenact it.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.062
- Yeah, here.
- Oh, my god! No, stop!

25:05.104 --> 25:05.938
Don't need to do that.

25:05.980 --> 25:08.524
Let's move forward.

25:08.566 --> 25:10.025
Open the letter.

25:10.067 --> 25:11.902
Okay, I'll open
the letter.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.071
Not like that.

25:16.658 --> 25:19.410
Dear Beauregard.
That's me.

25:19.452 --> 25:20.578
Congratulations on making it

25:20.620 --> 25:22.664
to the beautiful
Lucas Oil Speedway.

25:22.705 --> 25:23.665
Is that where we are?

25:23.706 --> 25:24.999
That's where we are.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.501
We're at Lucas Oil Speedway.

25:26.542 --> 25:28.544
How did he know where
we were going to be?

25:28.586 --> 25:29.629
He sent you here.

25:29.671 --> 25:30.796
Is he psychic?

25:30.838 --> 25:32.006
Is my dad psychic?

25:32.047 --> 25:33.966
No! Please continue.

25:34.008 --> 25:35.801
Still, that's weird though.

25:35.843 --> 25:37.345
Makes you think.

25:37.386 --> 25:38.346
- No.
- It does.

25:38.387 --> 25:39.347
- No, please.
- It does.

25:39.388 --> 25:40.515
Just continue.

25:40.556 --> 25:44.977
Find Mr. Carl Renezedner.
What is that?

25:45.019 --> 25:46.228
Rent-A-Center.

25:46.270 --> 25:47.396
Rent-A-Center?

25:48.939 --> 25:52.485
He will get you into
an off-road short course race.

25:52.527 --> 25:53.444
If you can podium...

25:53.486 --> 25:54.654
- Podium?
- Yeah.

25:54.696 --> 25:56.364
You've just gotta make
one, two, or three?

25:56.405 --> 25:57.615
I can.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.866
...your challenge continues.

25:58.907 --> 26:01.035
If not,
your journey ends here.

26:01.076 --> 26:04.205
Your father, Phineus.
Who is dead.

26:04.246 --> 26:05.164
Did he say I love you?

26:05.206 --> 26:07.166
No.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.043
Is that it?

26:09.084 --> 26:10.044
That's it.

26:10.085 --> 26:11.462
What do we...
what do we do now?

26:11.504 --> 26:13.172
We should probably
get some breakfast.

26:13.214 --> 26:14.674
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, no.

26:14.716 --> 26:18.469
We should find Carl Renezedner
and see when the race is,

26:18.511 --> 26:19.845
find out if you
need to train.

26:19.887 --> 26:20.846
I don't know
if you're good.

26:20.888 --> 26:22.473
Why do you care
what we do?

26:22.515 --> 26:23.349
I don't.

26:23.391 --> 26:24.642
The sooner we do this,

26:24.684 --> 26:26.185
the sooner this whole
thing is done.

26:28.479 --> 26:30.606
I'm getting the feeling
you don't care if I win or not.

26:30.648 --> 26:32.024
Yeah, Jason.

26:32.066 --> 26:34.736
I feel like you're not
on our team.

26:34.777 --> 26:35.819
I'm not.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.821
All right?
This is my job.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.448
All right, I have to see
this whole thing through

26:39.490 --> 26:41.950
for the company I work for.
Does that make sense?

26:41.992 --> 26:44.453
I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

26:44.495 --> 26:46.372
But we don't need
a babysitter.

26:46.414 --> 26:47.456
Yeah.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.875
Remember what happened
when my dad...

26:49.917 --> 26:51.669
- Yep. She fucked his dad.
- I know the story.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.546
'Cause I was married to him
and that was my wifely duty.

26:53.588 --> 26:54.505
All right, look.
Can we...

26:54.547 --> 26:56.257
can we please just
make a plan?

26:56.298 --> 26:58.175
Yeah, we can make a plan.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.344
We'll go find
Mr. Carl Rent-A-Center.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.387
- Fantastic!
- Yeah.

27:01.429 --> 27:02.597
Yes! Let's do that.

27:02.638 --> 27:04.098
You go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

27:04.139 --> 27:07.393
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:07.435 --> 27:08.603
Okay, yeah, let's go
find this guy.

27:08.644 --> 27:10.396
- All right.
- See you after breakfast!

27:10.438 --> 27:11.397
Oh, no, no, no, no!

27:11.439 --> 27:12.940
You said you were coming!

27:14.233 --> 27:15.276
Oh, my god.

27:17.111 --> 27:19.697
Oh, my god!
It is hot.

27:29.624 --> 27:30.750
Hey, Mr. Lawyer, look!

27:30.792 --> 27:31.917
- Oh, real nice.
- Look who I found.

27:31.959 --> 27:33.544
It's Carl Rent-A-Center.

27:33.586 --> 27:35.045
Yeah, and that's
his crew chief, too.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.464
- Hi. Yeah, hi.
- I'm Jason...

27:36.505 --> 27:38.132
I'm sorry, we don't have
time for introductions.

27:38.173 --> 27:40.008
- We have work to do.
- Gotta work.

27:40.050 --> 27:41.260
All right,
thank you for...

27:41.302 --> 27:43.721
- We didn't need you.
- No.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.181
Hey, how the hell?

27:46.223 --> 27:48.934
Oh, we just ran into them
at the truck stop.

27:48.976 --> 27:51.103
Well, how'd you know
it was them?

27:51.145 --> 27:53.731
His name is on, like,
everything they wear.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.774
Oh, yeah.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.485
You want a chip?

27:57.526 --> 27:59.194
I do not want a chip.
I want water.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.199
All right now, Bo,

28:04.241 --> 28:05.618
you're gonna have
to move faster than that.

28:05.660 --> 28:07.161
I know it's just
a practice truck,

28:07.202 --> 28:09.413
but it's still
got plenty of power.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.372
Okay.

28:10.414 --> 28:11.957
Come on, Bo,
you can do this.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.256
Woo!

28:19.298 --> 28:21.216
Punch it over that jump!

28:21.258 --> 28:22.510
Damn!

28:22.551 --> 28:25.220
I think I'm gonna
floor it!

28:25.262 --> 28:26.681
Whoo-hoo!

28:26.722 --> 28:28.850
Oh, no!

28:32.019 --> 28:33.855
Oh, my god,
is he okay?

28:35.230 --> 28:37.525
That was a good first lap,
there, Bo.

28:37.566 --> 28:38.942
That was good?

28:38.984 --> 28:40.194
You're still alive,
aren't you?

28:40.235 --> 28:41.320
Yeah.

28:41.362 --> 28:44.198
I did not like going
upside down.

28:44.239 --> 28:45.867
Well, you didn't
actually go upside down.

28:45.908 --> 28:46.992
You just spun out
a little bit.

28:47.034 --> 28:48.243
No, I... I went
upside down.

28:48.285 --> 28:49.704
I'm pretty sure.

28:49.745 --> 28:51.997
Just keep it on all fours
and you'll be just fine.

28:52.039 --> 28:54.583
No, my...
my vision went white,

28:54.625 --> 28:57.211
I saw some people that
I haven't seen in a while.

28:57.252 --> 28:58.629
Did he go upside down?

28:58.671 --> 28:59.922
Nope.

28:59.963 --> 29:02.132
All right, let's get into
our second lap, Bo.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.258
Okay, here we go.

29:04.385 --> 29:05.469
Whoo!

29:12.017 --> 29:13.644
♪ You like to fade in ♪

29:13.686 --> 29:15.396
♪ You like to fade out ♪

29:15.437 --> 29:17.481
♪ You and your wicked smile ♪

29:19.024 --> 29:20.984
♪ That's overrated ♪

29:21.026 --> 29:22.403
That's it,
Bo, that's it!

29:22.444 --> 29:23.738
Whoo!

29:26.323 --> 29:31.203
♪ So you're gonna
find a way ♪

29:31.245 --> 29:32.914
Yay for me!

29:38.293 --> 29:41.714
Oh, man, that was cool!

29:41.756 --> 29:45.300
Man, I went so fast.

29:45.342 --> 29:46.677
Oh, man, this thing works!

29:46.719 --> 29:48.220
- Yeah.
- That was awesome.

29:48.262 --> 29:50.514
- Oh, yeah.
- Boodle!

29:50.556 --> 29:51.974
Nope!

29:54.769 --> 29:56.437
You were fantastic, Bo.

29:56.478 --> 29:58.313
Thank you so much, Mandy.

29:58.355 --> 30:00.107
You definitely have
your father's genes.

30:00.148 --> 30:01.400
Hey, don't be afraid
to let her fly.

30:01.442 --> 30:02.526
She'll take it.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.737
Okay, I still got
a week to practice.

30:04.779 --> 30:07.489
Yeah. Nothing could
possibly go wrong now.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.660
Oh, man.

30:16.457 --> 30:17.583
Bo!

30:23.714 --> 30:25.716
Woah!

30:31.305 --> 30:32.765
Oh, my god!

30:37.102 --> 30:38.896
You think he's
gonna be all right?

30:38.938 --> 30:40.606
I'm guessing no.

30:42.900 --> 30:46.028
Whoa!

30:46.069 --> 30:48.280
Oh, man, hey, Eskie,
I really appreciate

30:48.322 --> 30:49.740
what you did for me
out there, all right?

30:51.617 --> 30:52.827
- Sorry.
- Shh.

30:52.868 --> 30:54.954
All right, all right,
you just rest now, okay?

30:54.996 --> 30:56.914
We're gonna win
this next one for you.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.707
Yeah, but also
for the money.

30:58.749 --> 31:01.084
Yes, also for the money.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.336
Shut up.
He can hear you.

31:02.377 --> 31:04.379
He can't hear nothing!
He's on so many drugs.

31:04.421 --> 31:06.465
He's up there floating around
with angels and stuff.

31:06.507 --> 31:07.883
Probably gonna write
a book about it,

31:07.925 --> 31:11.219
go on talk shows and stuff
about how heaven was real.

31:11.261 --> 31:13.055
Eskie?

31:13.096 --> 31:14.807
- Hmm?
- Okay, fine.

31:14.849 --> 31:17.852
Eskie, we're gonna win
this one for you!

31:17.893 --> 31:19.854
Okay?

31:19.895 --> 31:20.980
Thank you.

31:21.022 --> 31:22.564
Man!

31:22.606 --> 31:24.232
Oh, man.

31:24.274 --> 31:26.610
Sorry, I just
talk with my hands.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.320
Welcome, race fans,

31:28.362 --> 31:30.113
to the Lucas Oil Speedway.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.700
We've got an exciting day
of racing ahead of us.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.620
- This place is kind of gross.
- Sorry.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.914
Guys, Bo's race
is about to start.

31:38.956 --> 31:40.666
Okay.

31:40.708 --> 31:41.792
I'm Oswald.

31:41.834 --> 31:43.460
I'm... It's Jason.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.503
Hey.

31:44.545 --> 31:46.005
The lawyer for
your dad's company.

31:47.422 --> 31:49.424
Yeah. Oh, I know.

31:49.466 --> 31:51.134
Did you, uh, did you
bring me more clothes?

31:51.176 --> 31:52.386
No, it's gonna be
over after today.

31:52.427 --> 31:54.221
- So, let's just do it.
- Well, I don't know.

31:54.262 --> 31:55.764
He's been practicing
all week.

31:55.806 --> 31:57.599
He kind of a...
a natural.

31:57.641 --> 31:59.351
- What?
- Yeah.

31:59.393 --> 32:01.103
It's like
he's pretty good.

32:02.646 --> 32:05.399
Not cool, Jason.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.483
Not cool.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.528
No, I... well, what am
I supposed to...

32:09.570 --> 32:10.821
All right, race fans.

32:10.863 --> 32:12.239
Are you coming?

32:12.280 --> 32:15.367
Uh, no, I'm gonna meet up
with you guys later.

32:16.077 --> 32:19.246
My nanny never let me
have fried foods, but, uh...

32:19.287 --> 32:21.248
she's not here
right now, is she?

32:21.289 --> 32:22.666
Here we go.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.502
Up next on the track
are the Pro-4 trucks.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.337
We've got a great field
of Pro-4 drivers

32:27.379 --> 32:28.964
out here today, Mike.

32:29.006 --> 32:30.424
Especially the wildcard entry.

32:30.465 --> 32:31.675
A tractor-pull champion
from Tennessee

32:31.717 --> 32:33.552
named Beauregard Jackson.

32:33.594 --> 32:36.304
And fun fact, he's never
met his birth father.

32:36.346 --> 32:38.974
Well, that bastard
is in the gold #17 truck.

32:39.016 --> 32:40.851
This truck's made
out of gold.

32:40.893 --> 32:42.644
All right, Bo,
head on the swivel.

32:42.686 --> 32:43.979
We're about to go green.

32:44.021 --> 32:45.606
My favorite color.

32:45.647 --> 32:47.775
Tractor guy is
starting in the sixth spot.

32:47.816 --> 32:49.818
Might be the best
he does all day.

32:49.860 --> 32:50.611
- Eww!
- It'll be fine.

32:50.652 --> 32:51.737
It'll be fine.

32:51.779 --> 32:53.321
And we are
green, green, green!

32:53.363 --> 32:56.491
Hold on tight for 20 laps
of truck-banging action.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.123
Bradley Morris
moves into the early lead

33:02.164 --> 33:03.540
- followed by...
- Look at Jackson, Bob!

33:03.582 --> 33:04.917
He just might know what
he's doing out there!

33:04.959 --> 33:06.334
That's it, Bo.

33:06.376 --> 33:08.003
I don't know what
I'm doing out here!

33:08.045 --> 33:09.254
Tractor Jackson
is not afraid

33:09.296 --> 33:10.422
to get right in the mix.

33:10.464 --> 33:11.673
I love this guy!

33:11.715 --> 33:13.675
He's got some big ol'
bastard balls on him!

33:18.430 --> 33:19.514
Seven laps in

33:19.556 --> 33:21.725
and Ty LeDuc still
holds onto the lead.

33:21.767 --> 33:22.977
Yeah, Bob, but Tractor Jackson

33:23.018 --> 33:24.311
has climbed all the way
to second place.

33:24.352 --> 33:26.730
He's chasing down LeDuc
like a bat outta hell!

33:26.772 --> 33:29.858
Come on, Bo!

33:29.900 --> 33:32.736
Jackson has leader
Ty LeDuc in his sights.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.947
Jackson might just move
into the lead here.

33:34.989 --> 33:36.073
Oh, LeDuc goes wide.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.950
This is super easy!

33:37.992 --> 33:40.202
And there goes Jackson
into the... Oh!

33:40.243 --> 33:41.536
He got bumped in the turn!

33:41.578 --> 33:44.165
He's losing positions
with every passing second.

33:44.206 --> 33:45.624
He needs to
get back on the gas.

33:45.666 --> 33:47.042
Come on, Trackie!

33:47.084 --> 33:49.252
I'm gonna get that fucker!

33:49.294 --> 33:50.921
Now, Bo, you forget
about that guy.

33:50.963 --> 33:52.673
You just concentrate
on racing.

33:52.714 --> 33:53.715
You get that fucker!

33:53.757 --> 33:55.217
You get that fucker, Bo!
You get him!

34:00.472 --> 34:02.891
Damn! Jackson fell
all the way to seventh, Bob.

34:02.933 --> 34:04.685
I hope he didn't
quit his day job

34:04.726 --> 34:05.894
at the tractor pull.

34:05.936 --> 34:07.521
Now, Mike,
your guy is not done yet.

34:07.562 --> 34:09.397
He's still making
moves out there.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.650
Come on, Bo!

34:11.692 --> 34:12.860
No, Bob.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.195
He just got knocked
right off the course.

34:14.235 --> 34:14.902
He's done.

34:14.945 --> 34:16.404
I'm not done!

34:16.446 --> 34:18.699
I'm coming back!
I'm gonna get back in it!

34:18.739 --> 34:19.949
Oh, Bob, look!

34:19.992 --> 34:21.576
Trackie's back!
He's back in it!

34:21.618 --> 34:23.954
Well, this just doesn't
even seem fair.

34:23.996 --> 34:25.330
Whoo!

34:29.126 --> 34:30.710
Look at this battle
for third, Bob.

34:30.752 --> 34:33.380
Jackson might just find
the podium. Oh!

34:33.420 --> 34:35.465
There's contact between
Jackson and Fortin.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.092
- And they're into the wall.
- Oh, shit.

34:37.134 --> 34:38.219
Hard!

34:38.260 --> 34:39.719
Yep, slam into the wall.

34:39.761 --> 34:40.888
- I think he's out.
- What?

34:40.929 --> 34:42.223
- I think he's out.
- Why are you doing...

34:42.264 --> 34:43.724
This is what we want.
I don't want...

34:43.764 --> 34:44.975
I don't want him
to get hurt.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.976
And that'll bring
out a yellow flag, Bob.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.228
How's the truck?

34:48.270 --> 34:49.771
Engine's still humming.

34:49.813 --> 34:51.398
All right, Bo,
just sit tight.

34:51.438 --> 34:52.858
I'm gonna get
my boys over there

34:52.900 --> 34:55.694
and they're gonna untangle you
from the K-rail.

34:55.735 --> 34:57.487
Dammit, Bo!

34:57.529 --> 34:59.073
The pace car leads the way

34:59.114 --> 35:01.700
as the trucks regroup
for the green flag.

35:01.742 --> 35:02.951
Jackson's team
is working hard

35:02.993 --> 35:04.703
to get him off
that K-rail.

35:04.745 --> 35:06.538
I hope that damage
is only superficial.

35:06.580 --> 35:08.290
All right now, Bo,
I need you get to

35:08.331 --> 35:10.251
the back of the pack
before the restart.

35:10.292 --> 35:11.919
Yeah, I know.

35:14.088 --> 35:16.715
The hood keeps flappin'!

35:16.757 --> 35:17.758
Aww, never mind,
it came off.

35:17.799 --> 35:19.093
And with the track clear,

35:19.134 --> 35:21.511
our drivers are ready
to get back in the action

35:21.553 --> 35:23.097
behind leader
Doug Matag.

35:23.138 --> 35:24.472
All right, Bo,
it's time to get focused.

35:24.514 --> 35:25.515
You're in eighth place

35:25.557 --> 35:27.309
and you only got
four laps to go.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.686
Don't worry, I got this
figured out now.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.772
Well, shit,
that scares me, Bo.

35:33.148 --> 35:36.484
And we are
green, green, green!

35:36.526 --> 35:38.153
Matag's yellow 81 truck

35:38.195 --> 35:39.404
comes out in the lead.

35:39.446 --> 35:41.782
Anderson and Shinney
are chasing him down.

35:41.823 --> 35:42.741
Bob! Bob!

35:42.783 --> 35:43.909
Jackson's moved up
to seventh.

35:43.951 --> 35:45.202
I don't think
he's done yet!

35:45.244 --> 35:47.788
Yes, but he's still
got veterans McAkrin

35:47.829 --> 35:49.164
and LeDuc ahead of him.

35:49.206 --> 35:50.124
LeDuc spun out!

35:50.165 --> 35:50.999
Jackson moves to sixth!

35:51.041 --> 35:52.500
Nice, Bo, nice!

35:57.881 --> 36:01.009
And another pass by Jackson
puts him in fourth!

36:01.051 --> 36:02.552
Ha-ha! Bye, bitch!

36:02.594 --> 36:05.097
You only got one lap to go to
pick up that final position

36:05.139 --> 36:06.431
if you want a podium.

36:06.473 --> 36:07.849
That's all I need.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.981
Matag in the yellow 81
maintains the lead

36:14.022 --> 36:16.900
followed closely by
Anderson and McAkrin.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.860
Do you not see
Jackson in fourth, Bob?

36:18.902 --> 36:20.362
I have a good
feeling Trackie has

36:20.403 --> 36:22.572
a few tricks
up his sleeve.

36:25.367 --> 36:26.701
Oh, there he goes!

36:26.743 --> 36:28.162
Trading paint
with Anderson

36:28.203 --> 36:30.455
as he bumper cars
into second place!

36:30.497 --> 36:31.790
Go, Bo, go.

36:31.832 --> 36:33.334
Jackson just has to hold on

36:33.375 --> 36:35.502
around the final turn
to stand on the podium!

36:35.543 --> 36:36.544
Oh!

36:36.586 --> 36:38.213
Here we go! Here we go!
Here we go!

36:39.381 --> 36:41.925
Matag crosses
the line in first,

36:41.967 --> 36:43.010
McAkrin takes second.

36:43.051 --> 36:45.262
Jackson takes third, Bob!

36:45.304 --> 36:47.597
I knew it!
See, Bob! Booyah!

36:47.639 --> 36:49.183
In your face!

36:49.224 --> 36:50.392
He did it.
He podiumed.

36:50.433 --> 36:53.937
Jason, you're dead to me.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.606
I didn't...
I'm just doing my job.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.151
Umm, enjoy it
while it lasts.

37:02.529 --> 37:04.489
So, I'm still in the RV?

37:04.531 --> 37:06.825
Where you going?

37:06.867 --> 37:08.618
Where'd she go?

37:08.660 --> 37:10.829
It's over, Oswald.

37:13.374 --> 37:16.418
No, it is just beginning.

37:16.459 --> 37:18.128
Mmm. Oh!

37:46.948 --> 37:48.367
Come on, drink your beer.

37:48.409 --> 37:50.077
Drink your beer!

37:50.118 --> 37:53.330
Drink your beer
or you're a loser!

37:54.539 --> 37:56.833
- Oh, that's what she said.
- Sorry.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.835
Yeah, on that note,
I'm beat.

37:58.877 --> 37:59.878
I'm gonna go to bed.

37:59.920 --> 38:00.754
Okay.

38:00.795 --> 38:01.838
You were really
good today.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.631
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

38:08.636 --> 38:09.679
Goodnight!

38:09.721 --> 38:11.390
Goodnight.

38:13.808 --> 38:17.312
Hey, we should go look for
those Heart Stopper girls.

38:17.354 --> 38:18.939
The pretty ones
from the podium.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.690
Bo?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.901
Oh, no, you go on ahead.
I'm fine.

38:22.943 --> 38:24.236
I'm just gonna stay here
and chill out.

38:24.278 --> 38:27.155
If I bring 'em back here,
you gotta party with us.

38:27.197 --> 38:28.615
Yeah, okay.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.624
- Hell of a night.
- What are you...

38:37.665 --> 38:40.919
You should go in and say
goodnight to Mandy.

38:40.961 --> 38:42.337
I just did, dum-dum.

38:42.379 --> 38:45.299
Not... come on,
you like her, right?

38:45.340 --> 38:47.509
Yeah, of course!
She's my friend.

38:47.550 --> 38:48.593
Yeah, is that all?

38:48.635 --> 38:52.722
No, but... she was
my prom date, too.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.433
And so...

38:54.475 --> 38:56.643
And she's Noodle's mom.

38:56.684 --> 38:58.103
Oh, my god.

38:58.145 --> 38:59.438
- What?
- Forget it.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.814
What are you trying
to get me to say?

39:00.855 --> 39:02.441
Bo, come on.

39:02.483 --> 39:04.818
What?

39:04.859 --> 39:06.278
Okay.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.113
Okay, maybe a couple
of times in my life

39:08.155 --> 39:09.156
I've jerked off to her.

39:09.197 --> 39:10.449
Oh, my god!

39:10.491 --> 39:11.699
-But that's what everyone does.

39:11.741 --> 39:12.951
- Nope, don't need to hear it.
- It's natural.

39:12.993 --> 39:13.952
- She's a pretty girl.
- Nope, I'm going to bed.

39:13.994 --> 39:14.869
I'm going to
get some sleep.

39:14.911 --> 39:16.246
People jerk off
to people...

39:20.208 --> 39:21.335
- Jason! Jason, look!
- Watch the transit!

39:21.376 --> 39:22.461
- Watch the transit.
- While I was racing,

39:22.503 --> 39:23.628
- I came across a jump.
- Yeah.

39:23.670 --> 39:25.130
I came across a jump
like this.

39:25.172 --> 39:26.965
- I was like whoa!
- Whoo!

39:27.007 --> 39:29.009
Ooh!
That was awesome!

39:36.433 --> 39:37.559
This is it.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.478
That's my lawyer.

39:39.520 --> 39:42.147
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:42.189 --> 39:44.441
Well, thanks for a good night
last night, Noodle.

39:48.736 --> 39:51.281
Boop!

39:51.323 --> 39:52.907
- See ya later.
- Yeah.

39:54.493 --> 39:57.204
Noo-dle, where are
your clothes?

39:58.997 --> 40:03.043
I don't remember,
so, they let me wear this.

40:03.084 --> 40:06.129
Hot damn, Noodle!
You're like a sexual dynamo!

40:06.171 --> 40:09.383
I think I might work
for Heart Stoppers now.

40:09.424 --> 40:12.802
Well, hey,
um, so let's do this.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.888
Team Boodle is assembled.

40:14.929 --> 40:15.722
Are you ready?

40:15.763 --> 40:16.681
All right, I got it.

40:16.723 --> 40:17.558
- Here we go.
- No, no...

40:17.599 --> 40:18.808
Thumbprint.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.186
No, it's a...
it's a retina scan this time.

40:21.228 --> 40:23.271
I'm not putting
nothin' in my butt.

40:23.313 --> 40:24.606
I'll do it.

40:24.647 --> 40:26.983
No, no, no one has to put
anything in their butt.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.360
Your retina is
in your eye.

40:28.402 --> 40:31.363
Okay, show me,
Mr. Scientist.

40:31.405 --> 40:32.697
I'm gonna...

40:34.282 --> 40:35.450
- There.
- Okay.

40:35.492 --> 40:36.784
- All right, now you.
- He just looked into it.

40:36.826 --> 40:37.702
- Yes.
- All right.

40:37.744 --> 40:38.870
It's not gonna
tear my eyeball?

40:38.912 --> 40:39.913
It's not going
to tear out your eyeball.

40:39.954 --> 40:41.164
- All right.
- Just look into the...

40:41.206 --> 40:42.499
If it does, I'm gonna
punch you in your mouth.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.333
Okay.

40:43.375 --> 40:44.792
Just look.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.297
Whoop!

40:51.091 --> 40:53.552
Oh, California?
No thank you.

40:53.594 --> 40:54.595
Why?

40:54.636 --> 40:55.762
I don't like people
from California.

40:55.803 --> 40:57.972
They're funny,
and not in a funny way.

40:58.014 --> 41:00.975
Oh, and you also get this.

41:01.017 --> 41:02.603
Oh!

41:05.439 --> 41:06.440
- Oh, my god!
- Yeah.

41:06.481 --> 41:08.358
Let's go celebrate.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.526
I would love to,
but look,

41:09.568 --> 41:11.236
we've gotta go get Eskie
from the hospital

41:11.278 --> 41:13.614
and then get to the next race
so we can win more money!

41:13.655 --> 41:14.822
- All right.
- Come on, guys!

41:14.864 --> 41:17.033
I don't think Eskandar
is ready to travel.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.535
Oh, he'll be fine.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.994
Okay.

41:20.036 --> 41:21.622
Okay.

41:21.663 --> 41:23.164
Come on.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.334
I don't think
he's gonna fit.

41:26.376 --> 41:28.878
Oh, he'll fit.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.637
I wish he'd just die!

41:36.678 --> 41:38.763
It's like giving birth.

41:38.805 --> 41:41.766
I got it. I'm good!
I'm all good.

41:44.311 --> 41:45.562
All right.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.524
Ahh, there you go!

41:49.566 --> 41:51.610
Snug as a bug in
a Persian rug.

41:51.652 --> 41:53.320
All right!

41:53.361 --> 41:54.946
Let's move onto
the next race.

41:54.988 --> 41:56.698
Yeah.

41:58.241 --> 41:59.701
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

41:59.742 --> 42:01.828
You weren't expecting me
to recover, were you?

42:01.869 --> 42:04.747
That was not bad.
Not bad.

42:04.789 --> 42:06.500
Still got three races left
to run.

42:06.541 --> 42:08.209
Hey, you saw me out there.

42:08.251 --> 42:11.338
I'm a natural.
All natural.

42:11.379 --> 42:12.464
Like corn on the cob.

42:12.506 --> 42:15.925
- He's au naturale.
- Yeah.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.594
- That's not what you...
- Organic.

42:17.636 --> 42:18.345
think it means.

42:21.431 --> 42:24.267
You know...
it feels like...

42:24.309 --> 42:26.728
nothing could possibly
go wrong now.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.776
Oh, no, no, no!

42:36.279 --> 42:37.989
Fuckin' boats?

42:40.325 --> 42:42.160
Let's, uh,
let's win this one.

42:42.202 --> 42:43.370
Y'all go ahead.

42:43.411 --> 42:45.038
I'm gonna stay here
and set up camp, okay?

42:45.079 --> 42:46.498
Cool.

42:46.540 --> 42:49.376
How are we supposed to find
this Shelby Ebert anyway?

42:49.417 --> 42:51.628
We'll ask somebody.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.171
I can't just talk
to these people.

42:53.213 --> 42:54.589
They're Californians.

42:54.631 --> 42:57.258
They take away your guns
and make you get gay married.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.219
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

42:59.260 --> 43:01.722
- Seriously serious?
- Yes, I'm serious!

43:01.763 --> 43:03.890
Excuse me, where's...
we're looking for Shelby Ebert.

43:03.931 --> 43:05.183
She's over there.

43:05.225 --> 43:07.561
There, boom!
Was that so hard?

43:07.602 --> 43:09.062
Yeah, you're from New York.
Californians.

43:09.103 --> 43:11.606
Different tips on
the same liberal turd.

43:11.648 --> 43:12.566
Are you okay?

43:12.607 --> 43:15.736
Yes, I'm fine!
Okay? I'm fine!

43:16.570 --> 43:18.697
All right, come on, guys.

43:18.739 --> 43:19.947
Do you have
social anxiety?

43:19.989 --> 43:21.282
No, I don't.

43:21.324 --> 43:22.909
My cousin has that.

43:22.950 --> 43:24.869
Your cousin has epilepsy.

43:34.087 --> 43:35.463
Come on.

43:37.090 --> 43:38.633
Excuse me, Shelby?

43:38.675 --> 43:40.218
That's me.

43:40.260 --> 43:42.262
I'm sorry,
you're both Shelby?

43:42.303 --> 43:44.514
Yeah, she drives.
I make it go.

43:44.556 --> 43:45.390
Okay.

43:45.432 --> 43:46.808
- What's your name?
- Shelby.

43:46.849 --> 43:47.934
- And your name?
- Shelby.

43:47.975 --> 43:49.977
Two Shelbys, all right?

43:50.019 --> 43:51.271
You got it?

43:51.312 --> 43:52.397
Hi, I'm Jason Wilmore.

43:52.439 --> 43:54.357
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

43:54.399 --> 43:56.735
I'm the executor of
Phineus Davis' estate.

43:56.777 --> 43:58.779
Oh, we were so sorry
to hear of his passing.

43:58.820 --> 44:00.488
He loved a good speedboat.

44:00.530 --> 44:01.656
Ah, he did.

44:01.698 --> 44:03.950
And this is his son, Bo.

44:03.991 --> 44:05.493
I never met him.
He abandoned me.

44:05.535 --> 44:06.661
Okay.

44:06.703 --> 44:08.663
Hi, Bo, it's nice
to meet you.

44:08.705 --> 44:10.498
Uh, do you want to
check out your boat?

44:10.540 --> 44:11.249
Nope.

44:11.291 --> 44:13.126
What?

44:13.167 --> 44:14.711
I'm sorry, I mean,
no, thank you.

44:14.753 --> 44:16.755
Well, you're here to race,
aren't you?

44:16.797 --> 44:18.590
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe.

44:18.632 --> 44:22.427
Bo, what is going on?
Let her show you the boat.

44:22.469 --> 44:24.304
Okay, show me the boat.

44:24.345 --> 44:25.221
I'm so sorry.

44:25.263 --> 44:26.556
Yes, we'd love
to see the boat.

44:26.598 --> 44:27.515
Okay, cool.

44:27.557 --> 44:30.017
Apologies,
he hasn't eaten yet.

44:30.059 --> 44:33.354
Wow!

44:33.396 --> 44:36.608
Whoa, I can see
my reflection.

44:36.650 --> 44:38.109
That is
an impressive boat.

44:38.151 --> 44:39.277
Cool.

44:39.319 --> 44:40.403
Thank you guys
for doing this.

44:40.445 --> 44:42.530
Shelby, I really
appreciate it.

44:42.572 --> 44:44.991
But, uh, it's pink!

44:45.032 --> 44:46.618
Sure is!

44:46.660 --> 44:48.369
I ain't drivin'
no pink boat.

44:48.411 --> 44:49.912
Are you being serious
right now?

44:49.954 --> 44:51.914
Yeah, it's a girl's boat.
I ain't a girl!

44:51.956 --> 44:54.751
This boat is one of the fastest
in the entire sport!

44:54.793 --> 44:56.085
Sure is!

44:56.127 --> 44:57.962
Come on, Bo,
it's just one event.

44:58.004 --> 45:00.674
Plus, we could win
another five grand.

45:00.715 --> 45:03.050
We? It's not we,
Noodle, it's me!

45:03.092 --> 45:04.636
I have to do the racing.

45:04.678 --> 45:06.053
And I say no!

45:06.095 --> 45:08.389
Look, you're very pretty,
and I appreciate it a lot,

45:08.431 --> 45:12.268
but your boat sucks,
and I hate your guts!

45:12.310 --> 45:15.313
Ahh, I'm so sorry
about that.

45:15.355 --> 45:17.315
Um, we're going to
have to get back to you.

45:17.357 --> 45:19.192
I'm... I'm sure
the race is still on.

45:19.233 --> 45:20.694
Whoa! Whoa! Bo!

45:20.735 --> 45:22.487
What are you...
Is that yours?

45:22.529 --> 45:24.865
- No.
- Bo!

45:24.906 --> 45:25.740
Oh, my god.

45:25.782 --> 45:27.158
I'm... okay,
I am so sorry.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.326
Let me just... Bo!

45:28.368 --> 45:30.036
You shove that pink boat
up your ass!

45:30.077 --> 45:31.954
Do not make me
chase you, young man!

45:31.996 --> 45:32.873
Fuck you!

45:32.914 --> 45:34.165
Which one
of you is Shelby?

45:40.421 --> 45:42.382
Bo, honey, you okay?

45:42.423 --> 45:45.468
I'm not a girl!

45:45.510 --> 45:47.053
Well, okay, why don't
you come out here

45:47.094 --> 45:48.179
and we'll talk about it.

45:48.221 --> 45:49.597
No!

45:49.639 --> 45:51.432
I got you two of them
Heart Stopper drinks you like.

45:52.934 --> 45:55.102
- Heart Stoppers?
- Yeah.

45:55.144 --> 45:57.522
- Fine!
- Come out here.

45:57.564 --> 45:58.857
Come here.

45:58.899 --> 46:00.567
What's going on?

46:00.608 --> 46:02.819
- I don't know.
- Come sit down.

46:02.861 --> 46:04.362
- What happened?
- Stupid!

46:04.404 --> 46:07.741
They want me to ride
in a girl boat.

46:07.782 --> 46:08.909
What's it got?

46:08.950 --> 46:11.035
Like big ol' titties
and lashes, or what?

46:11.077 --> 46:12.829
No, it's pink.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.414
It's pink like
a Barbie boat.

46:14.455 --> 46:16.499
Yeah they're gonna
have me ride in a boat

46:16.541 --> 46:18.084
where everybody's like,
Oh, there's Bo

46:18.125 --> 46:20.336
in that pink boat,
what a dumb fuck.

46:20.378 --> 46:22.380
Boat races are stupid.
I hate 'em!

46:27.176 --> 46:29.554
Bo, is there something
else going on with you

46:29.596 --> 46:30.304
about all this?

46:30.346 --> 46:31.806
No, I'm just hungry.

46:31.848 --> 46:33.182
I need a cookie.

46:33.224 --> 46:34.768
- No, hey, Bo, wait, wait.
- I'll go get...

46:34.809 --> 46:36.102
Hey.

46:36.143 --> 46:39.146
If it's a secret, Bo,
I can keep a secret.

46:39.188 --> 46:42.525
Okay? Only you
and me will know.

46:42.567 --> 46:43.860
You won't tell Noodle?

46:43.902 --> 46:46.988
Not even Noodle.

46:47.029 --> 46:48.072
What about God?

46:48.114 --> 46:49.908
I can't keep a secret
from the Lord.

46:49.950 --> 46:52.034
He sees and hears everything,
praise be.

46:52.076 --> 46:54.495
Yeah, I know.
Praise be.

46:58.541 --> 47:00.084
What?

47:01.920 --> 47:03.546
I can't hear you.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.384
Oh, you can't swim.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.719
Yeah, I can't swim.

47:09.761 --> 47:12.513
Okay. Is that all?

47:12.555 --> 47:15.266
I'm afraid of the water.

47:15.308 --> 47:16.267
Okay.

47:16.309 --> 47:18.311
That's okay, darlin'.

47:19.687 --> 47:20.647
Okay, what about this?

47:20.688 --> 47:23.566
What if we find
some place, okay?

47:23.608 --> 47:26.569
And... and I'll just...
I'll teach you how to swim.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.154
In water?

47:31.699 --> 47:34.494
- There, it's in.
- Come on.

47:34.535 --> 47:36.496
Okay, just give me space.

47:36.537 --> 47:38.372
Don't you want
to win $5,000?

47:38.414 --> 47:39.540
Yes. Look.

47:39.582 --> 47:41.250

Noodle!

49:26.188 --> 49:29.109
Team freakin' Boodle!

49:29.150 --> 49:30.359
Afternoon, folks!

49:30.401 --> 49:32.112
Remember, on race day,
it ain't safe to have

49:32.153 --> 49:33.113
your kids swimming
in the water.

49:33.154 --> 49:34.530
You okay, Bo?

49:34.572 --> 49:35.698
I don't know.

49:35.740 --> 49:36.908
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

49:36.950 --> 49:38.242
It's okay.

49:38.284 --> 49:41.370
We're all right
here with you.

49:41.412 --> 49:42.914
Okay.

49:42.956 --> 49:45.625
Maybe what you're looking for is
right in front of your face.

49:45.666 --> 49:46.960
But I can't see
nothin' right now

49:47.001 --> 49:48.377
'cause you're right
in front of my face.

49:48.419 --> 49:50.630
Could you please move?

49:50.671 --> 49:51.505
Here you go.

49:53.633 --> 49:56.302
Okay.
I love you...

49:56.343 --> 49:57.929
Noodle.

49:57.971 --> 49:59.931
And Jason, you should
go to church.

49:59.973 --> 50:02.224
I'm just sayin' things
in case I die.

50:02.266 --> 50:05.019
All right, let's put
this thing in the water!

50:05.061 --> 50:06.729
Go ahead,
it's a good day to die!

50:06.771 --> 50:09.482
Drop me in! Team Boodle!

50:09.523 --> 50:10.900
All right,
let's get her wet!

50:14.070 --> 50:15.404
Bye, Bo.

50:15.446 --> 50:17.281
Good luck out there, Bo.

50:17.323 --> 50:19.408
I'm a bit nervous,
I gotta be honest.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.119
Okay, slow, slow.

50:21.161 --> 50:22.787
The race hasn't
started yet.

50:22.829 --> 50:23.955
Come on, slow down.

50:23.997 --> 50:25.665
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm sinking!

50:25.706 --> 50:26.749
I'm sinking!

50:26.791 --> 50:27.834
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

50:27.875 --> 50:28.960
- You're floating.
- No, I'm not.

50:29.002 --> 50:30.920
- It's... you're totally fine.
- Uh-uh.

50:31.337 --> 50:33.047
It's a beautiful day
here at Lake Mead

50:33.089 --> 50:37.135
for today's Lucas Oil
Drag Boat Racing Series.

50:37.177 --> 50:39.345
Up next in the pro
modified class

50:39.386 --> 50:40.680
is our special guest.

50:40.721 --> 50:43.432
If you follow off-road racing,
you know his name.

50:43.474 --> 50:46.310
It's bastard child tractor man
Beauregard Jackson,

50:46.352 --> 50:51.357
racing in Shelby Ebert's
hot pink Lucas Oil boat.

50:51.398 --> 50:54.027
Whoa! Shit!

50:54.068 --> 50:56.570
Jackson got
a great jump off the line.

50:59.115 --> 51:01.367
He's holding that Barbie
boat nice and steady.

51:01.408 --> 51:03.327
This is looking
like a solid run.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.623
That qualifies Jackson
for the elimination round

51:07.665 --> 51:09.667
with a time of 5:07!

51:09.709 --> 51:11.044
He qualified.

51:11.085 --> 51:13.046
Yeah.

51:13.087 --> 51:16.883
You know what we should do
is get some food.

51:16.924 --> 51:19.301
Do you not realize
what's at stake here?

51:19.343 --> 51:21.637
Oh, steak would be good!

51:25.558 --> 51:27.060
My soda!

51:27.101 --> 51:29.020
Stop whining!

51:29.062 --> 51:30.188
That will bring us

51:30.230 --> 51:32.899
to the semi-finals
in the modified circuit.

51:32.940 --> 51:35.068
David Logan
and Beauregard Jackson

51:35.109 --> 51:36.610
are the first
to match up.

51:36.652 --> 51:37.945
The winner of this race

51:37.987 --> 51:40.740
is guaranteed a spot
on the podium.

51:46.162 --> 51:47.329
This is it!
This is it.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.624
Jackson gets
a slow start off the line.

51:50.666 --> 51:53.294
Oh, but no,
look at that boat move!

51:53.335 --> 51:55.171
Yeah!

51:55.213 --> 51:56.672
And Jackson wins!

51:56.714 --> 51:59.675
Guaranteeing himself
a spot in the top two.

51:59.717 --> 52:01.135
That's my guy!

52:01.177 --> 52:02.511
- Whoo-hoo!
- Seriously, folks,

52:02.553 --> 52:03.763
who would have thought

52:03.804 --> 52:04.764
a bastard tractor driver

52:04.805 --> 52:06.390
from Tennessee
would be taking on

52:06.432 --> 52:08.559
veteran Bower
in the finals?

52:08.601 --> 52:11.353
Whoo!

52:11.395 --> 52:13.106
Bower jumps out
to the early lead,

52:13.147 --> 52:15.858
but come on, Bo,
you bastard!

52:15.900 --> 52:17.359
Oh, shit, Bower won.

52:17.401 --> 52:18.778
But, folks, come on,

52:18.819 --> 52:20.321
Beauregard Jackson had
a hell of a day.

52:20.362 --> 52:22.115
Holy shit!

52:22.156 --> 52:23.532
I didn't die!

52:25.118 --> 52:26.911
- That's my guy.
- Pink is a cool color.

52:26.953 --> 52:28.955
I told you pink is cool.

52:30.414 --> 52:31.749
And let's hear it

52:31.791 --> 52:34.501
for your second place finisher,
Beauregard Jackson.

52:52.812 --> 52:53.854
- Hey, Mr. Lawyer.
- Hey!

52:53.896 --> 52:55.522
Did you see me out there?

52:55.564 --> 52:56.983
I did.
I was watching.

52:57.024 --> 52:58.442
- Okay.
- Pretty impressive.

52:58.484 --> 53:00.987
Looks like Team Boodle might
podium in all these races.

53:01.028 --> 53:02.322
Maybe.

53:02.363 --> 53:04.865
- Team Boodle.
- Team Boodle.

53:04.907 --> 53:06.575
All right,
shall we do this?

53:06.617 --> 53:07.785
- See where we're headed?
- Yeah.

53:10.330 --> 53:12.456
Oh, that's gross.

53:12.498 --> 53:16.210
No, it's... it performs
a DNA analysis on your spit.

53:16.252 --> 53:17.586
- So you gotta...
- So I just spit in here?

53:17.628 --> 53:19.255
Yeah, just a little spit
right in there.

53:22.508 --> 53:24.260
Are you... oh, my...

53:24.302 --> 53:25.761
- No...
- I have a hard time spitting.

53:25.803 --> 53:26.846
I have a gag reflex.

53:26.887 --> 53:28.597
- Just spit. Just spit.
- Okay, hold on.

53:28.639 --> 53:29.598
There's spit
in your mouth.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.058
Every time we
go somewhere new,

53:31.100 --> 53:33.060
he has to blowjob
a suitcase?

53:33.102 --> 53:35.021
- Just let it out into the...
- Okay, there it goes.

53:35.062 --> 53:37.064
Oh, yep, yep.
Here we go.

53:39.359 --> 53:41.527
Oh, that scares
me every time.

53:41.568 --> 53:43.487
It's like how can you not
get used to that?

53:43.529 --> 53:46.782
Oh, Glen Helen Speedway,
San Bernardino, California.

53:46.824 --> 53:49.202
A speedway! And speed's
kinda my thing.

53:51.745 --> 53:53.122
Everything just
feels so great.

53:53.164 --> 53:54.832
You know what I mean?
Like nothing could possibly...

53:54.874 --> 53:55.708
- Stop!
- What?

53:55.749 --> 53:56.834
- Don't say that.
- What?

53:56.876 --> 53:58.294
The... What?

53:58.336 --> 53:59.962
You say that all the time,
that nothing can go wrong,

54:00.004 --> 54:02.006
and then something
immediately goes wrong.

54:02.048 --> 54:03.383
You understand that, right?

54:03.424 --> 54:05.009
Oh, come on, he can't
put a hex on things.

54:05.051 --> 54:06.886
No, yeah,
I cannot use my words

54:06.927 --> 54:08.095
and change the future.

54:08.137 --> 54:09.471
I mean come on,
I'm not a witch.

54:09.513 --> 54:11.224
This... you don't
have to be a witch.

54:11.265 --> 54:12.975
It's called a jinx.
Have you people...

54:13.017 --> 54:14.643
you've never heard of
a jinx, honest to God?

54:14.685 --> 54:16.979
Tell me.
Just please, don't...

54:17.021 --> 54:19.190
this one time for me,
don't say it.

54:22.443 --> 54:24.486
- Jason, listen.
- What?

54:24.528 --> 54:26.697
Buddy, hey.

54:26.739 --> 54:28.324
Everything's gone good, okay?

54:28.366 --> 54:29.033
Yes, I know.

54:29.075 --> 54:29.867
- Nothing...
- What?

54:29.909 --> 54:30.576
- Could...
- Don't.

54:30.617 --> 54:31.285
- Possibly...
- Please?

54:31.327 --> 54:32.036
- Go...
- You're not.

54:32.078 --> 54:32.786
- Wrong...
- Come on!

54:32.828 --> 54:33.495
Now.

54:33.537 --> 54:36.040
Beauregard Jackson?

54:36.082 --> 54:37.458
Oh, fuck!

54:38.876 --> 54:41.712
Hi, Vanessa Forrester.

54:42.838 --> 54:44.298
You were pretty impressive
out there today.

54:44.340 --> 54:46.092
Okay.

54:46.133 --> 54:47.885
Uh, well, um...

54:49.178 --> 54:50.512
I get...

54:51.931 --> 54:55.017
I mean, um, do we
know each other?

54:55.059 --> 54:56.269
Oh, well,
I'm a publicist.

54:56.310 --> 54:58.312
Sorry, I saw
your video online.

54:58.354 --> 54:59.730
Oh.

54:59.772 --> 55:01.190
I have a video?

55:01.232 --> 55:03.859
Yeah, the MAV-TV coverage
from your short-course race.

55:03.901 --> 55:04.860
It's going viral.

55:04.902 --> 55:06.946
Oh, no shit?

55:06.987 --> 55:08.697
- What does that mean?
- It means your sick.

55:08.739 --> 55:10.699
- No, it doesn't.
- Virus.

55:10.741 --> 55:12.034
- No.
- I don't know.

55:12.076 --> 55:13.494
It's... people are watching.

55:13.535 --> 55:14.536
A lot of people
are watching.

55:14.578 --> 55:15.662
- Ahh...
- Yes.

55:15.704 --> 55:17.081
And after what you did
out there today,

55:17.123 --> 55:18.707
- with the boats...
- Uh-huh?

55:18.749 --> 55:22.503
I have a feeling that
you could be a big star.

55:22.544 --> 55:25.381
And I'm always looking
for the next big star.

55:25.423 --> 55:26.215
Well, yeah, I was...

55:26.257 --> 55:27.758
Okay.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.885
I mean there's a lot
going on right now.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.178
Uh, it's a long story.

55:31.220 --> 55:32.388
I'm trying to win
this money.

55:32.430 --> 55:34.890
Well, I do love
a good story, Bo.

55:34.932 --> 55:37.643
I mean that's
kind of my job.

55:37.684 --> 55:39.853
I would love to hear it.

55:39.895 --> 55:42.523
Uh, okay.

55:42.564 --> 55:43.524
You want a drink?

55:43.565 --> 55:44.691
Yes, I would love a drink.

55:44.733 --> 55:46.277
- Okay.
- Thank you.

55:46.319 --> 55:47.778
Come on in.

55:49.696 --> 55:51.573
"I love a good story, Bo."

55:51.615 --> 55:54.535
"I'd love to hear
your stories, Bo."

55:57.746 --> 55:59.415
They've been in there
for over an hour.

55:59.457 --> 56:01.375
It's been like 15 minutes.

56:01.417 --> 56:03.210
Well, this is stupid.

56:03.252 --> 56:05.296
We should be
out celebrating.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.549
Let's just... this could
be a really big deal

56:08.590 --> 56:09.967
for Bo, okay?
So, let's just have

56:10.009 --> 56:12.719
a little more patience
and understanding.

56:12.761 --> 56:14.763
They're comin'.
Act natural.

56:19.852 --> 56:20.894
- So, okay then.
- Okay.

56:20.936 --> 56:22.480
I'll see you back
in San Bernardino.

56:22.522 --> 56:24.231
Yeah, thank you so much.
You've been so nice.

56:24.273 --> 56:25.774
Oh, come on.

56:27.276 --> 56:29.987
I know a winner
when I see one.

56:30.029 --> 56:31.405
Well, it was lovely
meeting you guys.

56:31.447 --> 56:33.699
Bye, Bo.

56:33.740 --> 56:35.451
All right, bye.
Take care.

56:35.493 --> 56:37.036
Okay.

56:39.663 --> 56:42.082
What in the holy hell were
you two talking about in there?

56:42.124 --> 56:44.418
I don't know. She wants to
do some kind of story on me.

56:44.460 --> 56:45.503
- Get out!
- Yeah.

56:45.545 --> 56:47.713
- Hey, that's great, Bo.
- Yeah, congrats.

56:47.754 --> 56:49.549
Well, let's go party.

56:49.590 --> 56:52.426
Oh, well, actually Vanessa
is going to be waiting for us

56:52.468 --> 56:54.094
down the road,
so, we've gotta...

56:54.136 --> 56:55.346
we gotta start moving.

56:55.388 --> 56:58.891
Oh, well...

56:58.932 --> 57:00.642
I'll go feed Eskandar.

57:00.684 --> 57:03.187
Okay.

57:03.229 --> 57:04.438
Hey, Bo?

57:04.480 --> 57:05.439
- Yeah?
- Hey.

57:05.481 --> 57:07.733
Um, before we
pack up and leave,

57:07.774 --> 57:09.360
you want to just
have a drink?

57:09.402 --> 57:10.986
Just you and me?

57:12.905 --> 57:13.864
No, I'm okay.

57:19.579 --> 57:21.372
He's an idiot.

57:48.399 --> 57:51.444
Noodle, I swear I did not
eat your Funyuns.

57:51.485 --> 57:52.819
Well, they're
not cannibals.

57:52.861 --> 57:54.113
They didn't eat themselves.

57:54.154 --> 57:56.240
Hey, Bo!

57:56.282 --> 57:57.866
Welcome to Glenn Helen.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.243
How do you know who I am?

57:59.285 --> 58:01.495
Your publicist Vanessa.
She called me.

58:01.537 --> 58:02.871
Says you're the real deal.

58:02.913 --> 58:03.872
King Michaels.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.541
He's as real
as the sky is blue.

58:05.583 --> 58:07.668
Well, can you
ride motocross?

58:08.377 --> 58:10.504
Can I ride motocross?

58:10.546 --> 58:12.298
Does a frog fart flies?

58:13.882 --> 58:16.677
- That's a yes.
- Amen.

58:16.718 --> 58:18.095
Well, I used to ride
with your father Phineus.

58:18.137 --> 58:20.097
Even let him win
once in a while.

58:20.139 --> 58:21.223
- Hmm.
- He was like

58:21.265 --> 58:22.475
a second father to me.

58:22.516 --> 58:24.560
Well, I never met him,
cause he abandoned me.

58:24.602 --> 58:26.812
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

58:26.853 --> 58:28.355
Yep.

58:28.397 --> 58:30.023
Well, Vanessa's got
a limo waiting for us.

58:30.065 --> 58:31.567
We're going to go downtown
and grab some lunch.

58:31.609 --> 58:32.568
You paying?

58:32.610 --> 58:34.111
- No, she is.
- Okay!

58:34.153 --> 58:36.405
You're my new best friend.
Let's go!

58:36.447 --> 58:37.906
- Sounds good.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

58:37.948 --> 58:39.492
I'm just supposed
to grab Bo.

58:40.534 --> 58:42.328
Well, I'm Jason Wilmore.

58:42.369 --> 58:44.163
I'm executor
of Phineus' estate.

58:44.204 --> 58:45.164
So, I should probably...

58:45.205 --> 58:46.540
No.

58:46.582 --> 58:48.501
Sorry, just Bo.

58:48.542 --> 58:49.460
Sorry, guys.

58:49.502 --> 58:51.170
Free food,
my hands are tied.

58:51.211 --> 58:52.171
Yeah.

58:52.212 --> 58:53.046
There you go.

58:53.088 --> 58:54.214
If you bring me more vegetables,

58:54.256 --> 58:55.090
I'm gonna kick your ass.

58:55.132 --> 58:56.425
I'm just kiddin'.

58:56.467 --> 58:58.469
So, I hear Bo is pretty
good at motocross already.

58:58.511 --> 59:00.012
Well, that's great.

59:00.053 --> 59:01.930
I want to set up
some interviews for you.

59:01.972 --> 59:04.141
We need to get
your story out there.

59:04.183 --> 59:05.184
I don't know.

59:05.225 --> 59:07.394
I ain't too good
at interviewing.

59:07.436 --> 59:09.563
Trust me, you're
going to be great.

59:09.605 --> 59:12.316
You have a natural charm.

59:12.358 --> 59:13.442
Do I?

59:13.484 --> 59:15.695
You do.

59:15.736 --> 59:17.779
Oh, you should interview
Mandy and Noodle, too.

59:17.821 --> 59:19.156
They're charming.

59:19.198 --> 59:21.701
- They seem really nice, Bo.
- They are.

59:21.742 --> 59:24.328
But they're not the ones
racing out there.

59:24.370 --> 59:27.873
This story is about you.

59:27.914 --> 59:30.000
They're just along
for the ride.

59:30.042 --> 59:31.293
Okay? Picture it.

59:31.335 --> 59:34.380
Beauregard Jackson,
billionaire baby!

59:36.048 --> 59:39.051
Yeah, like I could be
the star of my own movie.

59:39.092 --> 59:40.636
- Bingo.
- No.

59:40.678 --> 59:43.138
You are the star, Bo.

59:43.180 --> 59:46.099
A big huge star.

Where are you, Bo?

01:00:57.463 --> 01:00:59.214
You gotta be
here practicing.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.842
I'm working on marketing
myself right now, you know?

01:01:01.883 --> 01:01:02.884
Getting my face
out there.

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:04.261
Don't you worry,
I got this.

01:01:04.303 --> 01:01:05.512
These are professionals

01:01:05.554 --> 01:01:07.180
you're racing against.

01:01:07.222 --> 01:01:09.224
You trying to say
I ain't professional?

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:10.643
Well, the professionals

01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:12.894
- are here practicing, Bo.
- Hey, Bo.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:15.188
Would you mind
oiling my back?

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:17.691
- And I'm worried.
- No, I wouldn't.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:22.738
- Here you go.
- I'm gonna sit on your butt.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.490
- Hope I'm not too heavy.
- Oh, no. Ooh!

01:01:24.531 --> 01:01:26.116
No.

01:01:26.158 --> 01:01:27.868
I don't know what Noodle's
problem is, you know?

01:01:27.909 --> 01:01:29.244
Your star is rising.

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:31.831
They just want to ride
your coattails.

01:01:31.872 --> 01:01:34.958
Yeah, ride my coattails.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.043
You're your own man
now, Bo.

01:01:37.085 --> 01:01:39.463
I am.
I am my own man.

01:01:43.342 --> 01:01:46.178
Try... try the jump.

01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:47.680
Okay.

01:01:50.932 --> 01:01:52.351
Umm, no.

01:01:52.392 --> 01:01:53.853
You're really bad at this.

01:01:53.894 --> 01:01:55.437
Really bad, yeah.

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:56.438
Hey, guys.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.774
The star has returned.

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.321
Where the hell
have you been?

01:02:04.363 --> 01:02:05.698
Bo has been busy.

01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:08.408
Yeah, well, Bo has got
a race tomorrow,

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:10.536
and Bo hasn't been on
the track all this week.

01:02:10.577 --> 01:02:11.620
What the hell do you care?

01:02:11.662 --> 01:02:12.830
You afraid you're not
gonna be able

01:02:12.872 --> 01:02:14.414
to ride my coattails
no more?

01:02:15.749 --> 01:02:16.917
What's that now?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.837
I have to do all the racing,
all the winning.

01:02:19.879 --> 01:02:21.672
All you gotta do is
collect $100 a day

01:02:21.714 --> 01:02:23.048
and party with
Heart Stopper girls

01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:25.133
based on my famousness.

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:27.594
Are you being serious
right now?

01:02:27.636 --> 01:02:28.888
And how come you get
so many letters

01:02:28.929 --> 01:02:29.847
in the team name?

01:02:29.889 --> 01:02:31.223
It's like your whole name!

01:02:31.264 --> 01:02:34.100
The first two letters of
Boodle are Bo.

01:02:34.142 --> 01:02:36.061
That is literally
your whole name.

01:02:36.102 --> 01:02:37.730
That is your O,
not my O.

01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:38.731
Oodle, Noodle.

01:02:38.772 --> 01:02:39.899
All I get is the B.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.817
- Bo, calm down.
- No, uh-uh!

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:43.360
This is just like
when we were kids.

01:02:43.402 --> 01:02:45.404
You only wanted to be my
friend when I was winning.

01:02:45.445 --> 01:02:46.988
And then Tommy
started winning

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.824
and then you
were his friend.

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.367
We were all friends!

01:02:50.409 --> 01:02:51.993
And we were all
just happy for him.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:53.328
I wasn't happy for Tommy!

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.205
I was supposed
to win that race.

01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:57.165
I was supposed
to be the winner.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.209
A real friend
would have seen that.

01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:03.004
I am your real friend, Bo.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.631
Not from where
I'm standing.

01:03:12.097 --> 01:03:15.225
Well...

01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:19.354
if that's the way
you feel...

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:20.981
I'm out.

01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:23.692
Good luck tomorrow.

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:25.151
I don't need luck.

01:03:25.193 --> 01:03:26.737
I never need luck.

01:03:26.779 --> 01:03:28.614
I ain't no leprechaun.

01:03:28.655 --> 01:03:30.866
Hey.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.367
What's going on, Bo?

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.954
I do not need a speech
from you, too.

01:03:34.995 --> 01:03:36.204
Okay?

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:38.290
I am tired of everybody
telling me what to do.

01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:40.333
I'm my own man now.
My own Bo.

01:03:42.461 --> 01:03:44.546
Okay, Bo.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:51.219
Should I just...

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.054
- Yep!
- Yeah, okay.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:54.389
It's another hot one

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:58.226
out here at
the world famous Glen Helen.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:01.313
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have 20 laps of racing

01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:03.189
today in our open event.

01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:05.525
Of course, the big name
out here today

01:04:05.567 --> 01:04:09.070
is Beauregard Jackson,
sporting the number 27.

01:04:12.491 --> 01:04:13.533
- That's right, baby!
- Kill it, Bo!

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:22.542
- There you go.
- Okay.

01:04:22.584 --> 01:04:24.419
The riders are lined up.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.880
The gates are down
and here we go!

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.057
It's shoulder to shoulder
out here in the beginning.

01:04:37.098 --> 01:04:40.393
Jacobs and Bishop lead
the pack at the opening turn.

01:04:40.435 --> 01:04:42.312
But with so many
challenging riders

01:04:42.354 --> 01:04:43.480
out here today,

01:04:43.522 --> 01:04:46.316
this is literally
anybody's race.

01:04:50.445 --> 01:04:52.238
Why's my bike so slow?

01:04:56.785 --> 01:04:58.578
In spite of
all the hype surrounding

01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.913
Beauregard Jackson
this week,

01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:02.875
he is really struggling
out there today.

01:05:02.916 --> 01:05:05.836
What the hell
is going on?

01:05:05.878 --> 01:05:07.420
Halfway through the race,

01:05:07.462 --> 01:05:10.382
Jacobs still holds a slight lead
over Kennedy and Brown.

01:05:12.425 --> 01:05:13.802
Stupid bike!

01:05:15.136 --> 01:05:16.346
Come on, Bo.

01:05:19.766 --> 01:05:21.727
Jackson seems
to be out of his element

01:05:21.768 --> 01:05:23.896
and just can't keep up
with the leaders.

01:05:25.064 --> 01:05:26.773
Oww! What the...

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.651
Jackson
looks to be falling

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.444
even further behind.

01:05:31.486 --> 01:05:32.362
You came?

01:05:32.404 --> 01:05:34.531
- Yeah, I did.
- That's great!

01:05:34.573 --> 01:05:37.200
There might be a limiter
on Bo's throttle.

01:05:37.242 --> 01:05:38.618
Well, how would
you know that?

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.286
Engine whisperer?

01:05:40.328 --> 01:05:42.081
- Oh, that's a thing, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:42.122 --> 01:05:43.707
You've gotta tell him.

01:05:43.749 --> 01:05:45.333
No, no, you...
you tell him.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:46.835
He won't listen to me.

01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:48.420
We're in a fight.

01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:51.006
Well, look, I'm not supposed
to really get that involved.

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:53.341
If he's gonna
podium this race,

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:54.760
you've gotta tell him.

01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:00.891
But what if...
Noodle? Noodle!

01:06:07.188 --> 01:06:09.524
- Bo, Bo!
- Hi, Jason.

01:06:15.114 --> 01:06:16.907
It really looks
like Beauregard Jackson

01:06:16.949 --> 01:06:19.076
is getting frustrated
out there today.

01:06:19.118 --> 01:06:21.745
He just can't seem
to find his gear.

01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:23.705
Bo!

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:25.165
- Bo, Bo!
- Not now!

01:06:25.206 --> 01:06:26.374
Bo, Bo!

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:27.793
After his amazing performance

01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:31.296
in Pro-4's short-course racing
and his unbelievable run

01:06:31.337 --> 01:06:34.299
in drag boats,
I thought maybe, just maybe,

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.302
he'd surprise us
all again out here today.

01:06:42.348 --> 01:06:43.809
What the hell is he doing?

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.770
- Why is he on the track?
- Uh-oh!

01:06:46.812 --> 01:06:51.691
It looks like a crazy fan
has got himself onto the track.

01:06:51.733 --> 01:06:53.276
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:06:53.318 --> 01:06:54.778
There's a limiter
on your throttle!

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.029
- What?
- I don't know.

01:06:56.071 --> 01:06:57.447
It's something
on the bike.

01:06:57.489 --> 01:06:59.574
- Check your bike!
- My bike?

01:07:02.953 --> 01:07:04.037
It's a chipper clipper!

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.083
Security is
removing that crazed fan now.

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:11.128
Ooh, that's gonna
leave a mark!

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:12.212
What an idiot!

01:07:12.253 --> 01:07:14.297
I don't know, I think
he's kinda cute.

01:07:14.339 --> 01:07:16.175
Get up! Crazy fool!

01:07:16.216 --> 01:07:18.135
Let's get our bikes
back humming, folks.

01:07:18.177 --> 01:07:21.221
We're about to go green
with only six laps to go.

01:07:21.262 --> 01:07:22.222
Hi!

01:07:22.263 --> 01:07:23.890
Oh, the bike is faster!

01:07:26.726 --> 01:07:28.687
Jackson seems to
have found a new gear

01:07:28.728 --> 01:07:30.772
as he's now chasing
down the pack.

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:32.232
That one took it!

01:07:32.273 --> 01:07:35.027
Number 27, Jackson,
with a nice pass.

01:07:37.988 --> 01:07:39.280
Whoo!

01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:50.209
Jackson is flying
by the competition now.

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.877
He's a man on a mission.

01:07:54.546 --> 01:07:56.422
With only one lap to go,

01:07:56.464 --> 01:07:58.675
Jackson has climbed
into third place.

01:07:58.717 --> 01:08:00.301
He just needs to
hold this position

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:01.302
to finish on the podium.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:03.596
Whoo!

01:08:08.434 --> 01:08:09.728
As we approach
the finish line,

01:08:09.769 --> 01:08:11.938
Jacobs pulled away
and is going to

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.356
take first place easily,

01:08:13.398 --> 01:08:14.858
followed by Vaughn
in second.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.736
And here comes
Jackson to the line!

01:08:20.404 --> 01:08:23.575
Oh, shit!
I'm going upside down!

01:08:25.785 --> 01:08:26.870
Oh!

01:08:26.912 --> 01:08:28.205
Both the bike and Jackson

01:08:28.247 --> 01:08:30.165
make it over the finish line
to take third place

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:34.419
in one of the wildest finishes
I have ever seen!

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.462
Oh, shit,
that hurt so much.

01:08:36.504 --> 01:08:37.671
Well, it seems
like there's nothing

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:39.883
that can stop
Beauregard Jackson.

01:08:39.925 --> 01:08:42.219
Whoo!

01:08:42.261 --> 01:08:44.970
Underneath the Yamaha Bridge.

01:08:45.013 --> 01:08:47.974
I'm in a tunnel,
motherfucker!

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.520
Yes.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:55.274
That was not the plan.

01:08:55.314 --> 01:08:57.358
Obviously.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.734
It wasn't my fault.

01:08:58.777 --> 01:09:01.321
It was that dildo Jason.

01:09:01.362 --> 01:09:04.365
He knew about
the bike somehow.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:07.160
I need you to focus
and stop dicking around.

01:09:07.202 --> 01:09:09.662
He cannot even enter
the next race.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.331
Do you hear me?

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.255
Hey! Noodle! Mandy!

01:09:18.296 --> 01:09:20.215
Hey, there, superstar!

01:09:22.884 --> 01:09:25.261
God, what
an amazing comeback.

01:09:25.304 --> 01:09:26.805
What?

01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:30.142
Oh, the race.
Right. Uh, yeah.

01:09:30.183 --> 01:09:31.143
The bike was all...

01:09:31.184 --> 01:09:32.393
Yes, the bike.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:35.563
I mean you made it go
so much faster.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.689
Yeah.

01:09:36.731 --> 01:09:38.024
Yeah, I think King
did something to it.

01:09:38.066 --> 01:09:39.609
He was acting a little
weird back there.

01:09:39.651 --> 01:09:42.612
I bet he did.
I never trusted him.

01:09:42.654 --> 01:09:45.282
God, you're like
really smart.

01:09:45.323 --> 01:09:47.908
Thank you for noticing.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.410
Okay, so where to next?

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:52.622
Oh, um, well,
there's this box.

01:09:52.663 --> 01:09:54.666
It tells me what I need
to do and all that

01:09:54.707 --> 01:09:56.335
and, um,
it's impossible to open.

01:09:56.376 --> 01:09:57.794
It's like
a James Bond type thing.

01:09:57.836 --> 01:09:59.129
You've gotta get
like DNA testing

01:09:59.171 --> 01:10:01.422
- and all that kind of jazz.
- Sure, of course.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:02.257
Like that?

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:04.092
Yeah, like that.

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:07.012
Uh, I did not know
that did that.

01:10:07.053 --> 01:10:08.596
I was not aware.

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:11.224
Monster Jam Arena,
Anaheim, California.

01:10:11.266 --> 01:10:12.475
Okay, now this is it.

01:10:12.517 --> 01:10:13.643
This is the last stop.

01:10:13.685 --> 01:10:14.936
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.271
So, come on, you're riding
with me in my limo.

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:17.730
Wa-wa-wait, wait. I...

01:10:17.772 --> 01:10:18.898
I gotta wait
for my team.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.774
- Your team?
- Yeah.

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:21.067
What team?

01:10:21.109 --> 01:10:23.987
The team that abandoned you
out there today?

01:10:24.029 --> 01:10:25.989
Screw them, Bo!

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:29.742
Look, you don't need them.

01:10:29.784 --> 01:10:30.827
Okay?

01:10:30.869 --> 01:10:33.454
And besides, you've...
you've got me.

01:10:50.096 --> 01:10:51.431
Yeah, okay,
whatever you say.

01:10:51.472 --> 01:10:53.725
- I'll do it.
- Let's go!

01:10:53.766 --> 01:10:55.727
Anaheim, here we come!

01:11:03.484 --> 01:11:05.320
Was that Bo?

01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:06.738
Yeah.

01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:09.699
He found himself
another ride.

01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:10.992
We gotta get going.

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:13.370
Screw him, I'm not
going to Anaheim.

01:11:13.412 --> 01:11:15.330
Anaheim?

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:16.581
No.

01:11:16.622 --> 01:11:19.209
I gotta go get
Jason out of jail.

01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:21.461
Jail?

01:11:21.502 --> 01:11:23.380
- Holy...
- Shit.

01:11:26.091 --> 01:11:27.342
- Like it?
- Yeah!

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.885
Yeah, I like it.

01:11:28.927 --> 01:11:31.512
This is amazing!
Oh!

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:37.102
I feel like I'm rich,
but I'm not, you know?

01:11:37.143 --> 01:11:39.145
What you wanna do now?

01:11:42.648 --> 01:11:44.984
Holy shit!

01:11:45.026 --> 01:11:46.403
You like?

01:11:49.781 --> 01:11:51.657
Uh, is solitary
an option?

01:11:55.703 --> 01:11:56.746
Hey, guys.

01:12:02.127 --> 01:12:03.795
Who's my big champion?

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:08.133

Noodle!

01:12:43.876 --> 01:12:46.463
You kicked me right in my balls.
That hurt like hell.

01:12:46.505 --> 01:12:48.131
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:48.173 --> 01:12:49.299
Are you pooping?

01:12:49.341 --> 01:12:50.216
No.

01:12:50.258 --> 01:12:51.510
There was just
nowhere to sit.

01:12:51.551 --> 01:12:53.845
- I couldn't...
- Watch your head.

01:12:53.886 --> 01:12:56.389
Thank you, thank you.

01:12:56.431 --> 01:12:58.808
I'll send you that recipe
we talked about.

01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.268
- Slap me.
- I'm not gonna slap you.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:04.147
Ah, Jesus!
What is wrong with you?

01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:06.858
Yes!

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:15.325
Oh, good job.

01:13:15.367 --> 01:13:16.826
- Thank God.
- Thank you.

01:13:16.868 --> 01:13:18.286
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:13:18.328 --> 01:13:19.620
Oh, thank you for
bailing me out.

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:21.831
- Mm-hmm.
- Where is Bo?

01:13:21.873 --> 01:13:23.666
Oh, he rode with Vanessa.

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:24.959
To where?

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.711
He said Anaheim.

01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:29.506
That's near Hollywood

01:13:29.548 --> 01:13:31.591
where they make movies
about beautiful people

01:13:31.632 --> 01:13:33.259
doing cool sexy things.

01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:37.013
Yeah, they make other kinds
of movies there, too.

01:13:37.055 --> 01:13:38.848
Oh, God.
You know what?

01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:39.932
I bet it's
this Monster Jam.

01:13:39.974 --> 01:13:41.351
This is not good.

01:13:41.393 --> 01:13:42.727
Oh, don't worry,
he'll be great,

01:13:42.768 --> 01:13:43.811
He loves big trucks.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.980
No, it's not...
this is tomorrow night.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.482
Does he have any idea?

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:48.691
Whatever.

01:13:48.733 --> 01:13:50.443
He don't need us taking
care of him anymore.

01:13:50.485 --> 01:13:51.861
He's got Vanessa now.

01:13:51.903 --> 01:13:54.739
Vanessa, yeah, that's exactly
what I'm worried about.

01:14:12.507 --> 01:14:13.883
He's not picking up.

01:14:13.925 --> 01:14:15.093
We've gotta go find him.

01:14:15.134 --> 01:14:17.220
No! Didn't you hear him
at the track, Jason?

01:14:17.262 --> 01:14:18.721
He don't need
our help no more.

01:14:18.763 --> 01:14:20.640
He did kind of
leave you in jail.

01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:22.975
I know, I know, look.

01:14:23.017 --> 01:14:24.936
This is my job.
Just let me do it,

01:14:24.977 --> 01:14:26.521
see this thing
through, please.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:27.897
Your job?

01:14:27.939 --> 01:14:30.108
Is that why you ran on
the track like a crazy man?

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:32.068
Just some job?

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:33.945
You know what
I think, Noodle?

01:14:33.986 --> 01:14:36.573
I think this guy
is starting to like us.

01:14:36.615 --> 01:14:37.823
No.

01:14:37.865 --> 01:14:40.619
No, it's not that,
it's just, this is a job.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.036
- You like us.
- No.

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:43.829
- You're in love with us.
- No, I...

01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:44.830
You wanna be
our best friend.

01:14:44.872 --> 01:14:45.831
- You do.
- No, I..

01:14:45.873 --> 01:14:47.292
You like us.

01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:49.377
All right fine, yes,
I like you guys, all right?

01:14:49.419 --> 01:14:51.170
You're nice, and you do
nice things for each other,

01:14:51.212 --> 01:14:52.631
and you get me out of jail

01:14:52.672 --> 01:14:55.758
and the people I know don't
normally behave like that.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.760
The people you know
are dicks.

01:14:57.802 --> 01:15:01.139
Big fat penises.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.558
Yeah, I know
a lot of dicks.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.893
Well, we're not dicks.

01:15:05.935 --> 01:15:07.979
He's our friend,
let's go help him.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.397
- Yeah.
- No.

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:10.773
Ya'll I'm not going.

01:15:10.815 --> 01:15:12.692
I'm not gonna chase
after Bo anymore.

01:15:12.733 --> 01:15:14.486
But you like Bo.

01:15:14.527 --> 01:15:16.279
Yeah, I do like Bo.

01:15:16.321 --> 01:15:18.448
I like him too much.

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.033
I've liked him
my whole life.

01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:22.201
I'm sorry, Noodle,

01:15:22.243 --> 01:15:24.078
but when you're older
you'll understand.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.913
But I'm your age.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:28.833
Yeah, no, it's just
a different, um...

01:15:28.874 --> 01:15:30.502
but I understand,
Mandy, all right?

01:15:30.543 --> 01:15:31.628
Just come with us
to Anaheim

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:34.631
and I'll get you
back to Tennessee.

01:15:34.673 --> 01:15:36.508
Thank you, Jason.

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:40.178
Count me in!

01:15:40.219 --> 01:15:41.554
Of course you're in.

01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:43.431
You got nowhere else
to go.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:47.560
I forgot that guy
was back there.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:06.579
I'm sorry, just, you're
a hard woman to find, Chrissy.

01:16:06.621 --> 01:16:10.625
Jason, did you
lose something?

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:11.792
Where's Bo?

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:14.462
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:16.130
His final race is today.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.216
Mmm...

01:16:18.257 --> 01:16:23.763
No, Jason, his last race
was yesterday.

01:16:23.804 --> 01:16:26.516
Now I hope you enjoy
your little dipshit friends

01:16:26.558 --> 01:16:29.894
and they help you get a job at
the Tennessee suck and fuck

01:16:29.935 --> 01:16:31.730
when I take over
my Dad's company.

01:16:33.064 --> 01:16:35.525
'Cause I am never
giving you a job,

01:16:35.567 --> 01:16:39.571
and you're never going
to enjoy all of this.

01:16:43.908 --> 01:16:45.951
It's not that great
anyway, that...

01:16:45.993 --> 01:16:47.119
this whole....

01:16:47.161 --> 01:16:48.996
Let me tell you,
I don't need any of that.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.042
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.880
Idiot.

01:16:57.922 --> 01:17:00.675
Look, Michael,
all I need to know from you

01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:04.637
is your biggest room service
order from last night.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:14.188
Bo!

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.107
Bo, buddy.

01:17:16.148 --> 01:17:17.858
Hey, Bo, come on, wake up.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.652
- Jason!
- You okay?

01:17:19.694 --> 01:17:21.237
What happened here
last night?

01:17:21.279 --> 01:17:23.155
- Where's Vanessa?
- I don't know.

01:17:23.197 --> 01:17:25.366
We made love.
I think we did.

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:26.992
I don't know,
I don't remember.

01:17:27.034 --> 01:17:28.411
Okay.

01:17:28.453 --> 01:17:29.870
- Why does this always happen?
- Vanessa tricked you.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:31.497
I always fall in love
with the wrong people.

01:17:31.539 --> 01:17:33.249
You have one more race,
it's tonight.

01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:34.917
- Tonight?
- We have to get you up.

01:17:34.959 --> 01:17:36.335
Hold on, I'm lovesick.

01:17:36.377 --> 01:17:38.045
- Give me a moment.
- Give me...

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:39.547
Come on, up. Up!

01:17:39.589 --> 01:17:41.382
I don't want
to race ever again.

01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:43.635
Let's give you
one more race.

01:17:43.676 --> 01:17:45.094
- There we go.
- Oh, yeah.

01:17:45.136 --> 01:17:46.596
- I'm all right.
- All right, good.

01:17:46.638 --> 01:17:48.848
Oh...

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.560
Oh, yeah.

01:17:52.602 --> 01:17:54.103
Let it out, let it out.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.571
Oh, God.
Oh, buddy, buddy.

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:04.989
Hold on.
We're good.

01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.948
It's good, it's good,
it's good.

01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.949
Leave it, leave it.

01:18:06.991 --> 01:18:08.075
I'll come back for it.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:09.118
Oh, God, this is it.
This is the truck.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.244
Okay, let's do it.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:11.579
- Let's do it.
- Hey, excuse me, ladies.

01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:13.080
- Linsey Weenk?
- Oh, hey, hey.

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:14.206
Oh, God, hi.
Good to meet ya.

01:18:14.248 --> 01:18:15.040
You Bo?

01:18:15.082 --> 01:18:16.375
No, no, no.
I'm not Bo.

01:18:16.417 --> 01:18:18.336
Uh... that's Bo.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:24.008
Oh, has he ever driven
a monster truck before?

01:18:24.049 --> 01:18:25.551
Uh...

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:30.348
Anaheim, California,

01:18:30.389 --> 01:18:35.687
are you ready to
experience Monster Jam?

01:18:35.728 --> 01:18:38.815
Hold on to your seats,
for all the racing

01:18:38.857 --> 01:18:40.650
and freestyle action.

01:18:40.692 --> 01:18:42.777
Eh, how's this...
Is it?

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:44.111
How do you get it on?

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:46.614
Oh, okay, that works.

01:18:46.656 --> 01:18:48.032
Okay, sorry, sorry.

01:18:48.073 --> 01:18:52.077
Sorry, sorry.

01:18:52.119 --> 01:18:54.455
All right, did you get
Mandy off okay?

01:18:54.497 --> 01:18:57.416
Yeah, I dropped her off
at the bus station.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:19:00.252
No I, I to you to
fly her home.

01:19:00.294 --> 01:19:05.007
There's no such thing as
a flying bus, Jason.

01:19:05.049 --> 01:19:06.008
That is true.

01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:07.301
All right,
there's three events.

01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:09.512
The first one's
a speed event.

01:19:09.554 --> 01:19:11.931
He's just got to beat this guy,
advance a few rounds,

01:19:11.972 --> 01:19:13.391
and then he'll get
some decent points.

01:19:13.432 --> 01:19:15.142
Our next matchup
is Jon Zimmer

01:19:15.184 --> 01:19:18.103
in his fire breathing
dragon ice truck.

01:19:18.145 --> 01:19:19.689
Does mine breath fire?

01:19:19.731 --> 01:19:23.651
Oh, wait.
Uh, this and this.

01:19:23.693 --> 01:19:25.110
He'll be taking on
rising motorsports star,

01:19:25.152 --> 01:19:26.278
- Beauregard Jackson.
- Okay, where's prism?

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.613
Yeah this works.

01:19:27.655 --> 01:19:28.865
He is driving
the Lucas Oil Crusader.

01:19:28.907 --> 01:19:30.991
I got it! Yes!

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:34.078
Let's give him
a warm Monster Jam welcome.

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:41.627
You said you
had this handled.

01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:43.713
He was out cold.

01:19:47.466 --> 01:19:49.886
Here we go.

01:19:49.928 --> 01:19:51.596
Both trucks are
good off the line.

01:19:55.182 --> 01:19:56.809
Go, go.

01:19:56.851 --> 01:19:58.561
Zimmer's up by a leap.

01:19:58.603 --> 01:20:00.479
Jackson needs to punch it
into this final turn.

01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:05.735
Shit! Aah!
Not upside down!

01:20:05.777 --> 01:20:07.111
Ooh!

01:20:07.152 --> 01:20:09.697
And the crusader goes
tits up in the speed round.

01:20:09.739 --> 01:20:13.117
Well, folks, so much
for our rising star.

01:20:13.158 --> 01:20:16.287
He is one and done
in the speed round.

01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:17.705
Thank you!

01:20:25.713 --> 01:20:27.799
Rough start.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.550
Can I even come back
from that?

01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:32.470
There's still
two more events.

01:20:32.511 --> 01:20:34.305
I don't know what to do.

01:20:34.346 --> 01:20:37.182
I wish Noodle was here.

01:20:37.224 --> 01:20:38.977
I can, uh, help
with that wish.

01:20:39.018 --> 01:20:41.520
You look like shit.

01:20:41.562 --> 01:20:46.943
Noodle!

01:20:46.985 --> 01:20:47.902
I'm so sorry.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:49.988
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:20:50.029 --> 01:20:51.530
There there, you're not.

01:20:51.572 --> 01:20:53.365
I wronged you.

01:20:53.407 --> 01:20:54.450
I forgive you.

01:20:54.492 --> 01:20:56.410
You're a ray
of fucking sunshine.

01:20:56.452 --> 01:20:59.038
You're a ray
of fucking sunshine.

01:20:59.079 --> 01:21:01.582
Did you see me
driving out there?

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:03.208
I would not
call that driving.

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:03.918
I know.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.086
It only gets harder too.

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:07.338
I'm here, too, Bo.

01:21:07.379 --> 01:21:09.381
Yeah, hey, Eskie,
how's it going?

01:21:09.423 --> 01:21:10.675
Well, the team
is together, right?

01:21:10.716 --> 01:21:11.843
Two more events.

01:21:11.884 --> 01:21:13.719
Go out there and
claim your fortune, Bo.

01:21:13.761 --> 01:21:15.220
What about Mandy?

01:21:15.262 --> 01:21:17.348
Is she here too?

01:21:17.389 --> 01:21:20.518
Oh, I uh... she's on
her way to Tennessee.

01:21:20.559 --> 01:21:22.645
I dropped her off
at the bus station.

01:21:22.687 --> 01:21:25.731
Damn, I really
messed it up with her.

01:21:25.773 --> 01:21:27.358
She hates me now.

01:21:27.399 --> 01:21:30.695
Oh, my God, she's
in love with you, Bo.

01:21:30.736 --> 01:21:31.612
What?

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:33.405
You love Mandy,
Mandy loves you.

01:21:33.447 --> 01:21:34.782
You just gotta tell her.

01:21:34.824 --> 01:21:35.950
How'd you know
I loved her?

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:37.869
It's obv... Everyone knows.
It's obvious.

01:21:40.621 --> 01:21:42.540
She's married
to Noodle's dad.

01:21:42.581 --> 01:21:45.043
They got divorced
like five years ago

01:21:45.084 --> 01:21:46.460
when he left.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:47.336
They did?

01:21:47.378 --> 01:21:48.796
He ain't never
coming back.

01:21:48.838 --> 01:21:51.215
Plus, if you
were with Mandy...

01:21:51.256 --> 01:21:52.758
Yeah?

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.802
You'd be my dad.

01:21:59.098 --> 01:22:00.892
- Team Dad Noodle!
- Team Dad Noodle!

01:22:04.311 --> 01:22:05.187
All right.

01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.980
Okay, let's go get her.

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:06.981
No, no, no, no, no, no,

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:08.357
the second event's
about to start.

01:22:08.399 --> 01:22:10.651
So? I've gotta go
tell her I love her.

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:12.862
She might still be
at the station.

01:22:12.904 --> 01:22:13.821
Okay, let's go get her.

01:22:13.863 --> 01:22:15.614
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bo, no, no.

01:22:15.656 --> 01:22:17.075
Don't... you don't have
to tell her tonight.

01:22:17.116 --> 01:22:18.534
Just big picture
here, right?

01:22:18.576 --> 01:22:21.537
You stay here, you do this,
you win the event,

01:22:21.579 --> 01:22:23.873
you get the money,
and then you go home

01:22:23.915 --> 01:22:25.499
and you tell her
you love her.

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:26.208
Right?

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:27.668
Not good enough, Jason.

01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:30.421
I cannot do this
without her.

01:22:30.462 --> 01:22:32.840
You will miss this event.

01:22:34.633 --> 01:22:36.635
I don't care.

01:22:36.677 --> 01:22:39.179
Love is more important.

01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:40.598
It's stronger
than anything.

01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:41.933
Okay, let me...
let me get this straight.

01:22:41.974 --> 01:22:45.728
So I, um, I got tackled
by like two beefcake men,

01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:49.648
who maybe broke two of my ribs,
I spent the night in jail

01:22:49.690 --> 01:22:52.276
dancing with
some dickhole Persian mafia,

01:22:52.317 --> 01:22:53.736
and I lost my job.

01:22:53.778 --> 01:22:56.238
I mean, when I get back
to New York there is nothing.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.116
My life is over.

01:22:58.157 --> 01:22:59.825
And you want to go tell
the woman you've loved

01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:03.079
for thirty years right now
that you love her?

01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:05.247
You can't wait
thirty years and a day,

01:23:05.289 --> 01:23:07.083
and so you lose this,
and then everything's gone.

01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:08.333
You want me in on that?

01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:11.754
You're either with us,
or you're against us.

01:23:11.796 --> 01:23:13.631
I'm with ya, let's go.

01:23:16.634 --> 01:23:19.261
Hey, can I get
a ticket to, uh,

01:23:19.303 --> 01:23:21.388
Pigeon Forge,
Tennessee, please?

01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:29.313
Why so sad, little lady?

01:23:29.354 --> 01:23:31.816
It's just...

01:23:31.857 --> 01:23:34.902
you know, somebody turned out
to not be the person

01:23:34.944 --> 01:23:36.236
that I thought he was.

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:40.365
I see.

01:23:40.407 --> 01:23:44.495
Well, darlin' love
can make a man crazy,

01:23:44.536 --> 01:23:47.331
but it can't
make him a sandwich.

01:23:48.666 --> 01:23:51.002
Sorry, I don't understand.

01:23:51.043 --> 01:23:53.545
Well just think on it
for a while.

01:23:53.587 --> 01:23:56.215
- Okay.
- Think on it.

01:23:56.256 --> 01:23:58.383
Thank you.

01:23:58.425 --> 01:24:01.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
this is totally blocked in.

01:24:01.053 --> 01:24:03.139
We'll never get the RV
out of here.

01:24:03.181 --> 01:24:06.142
Bo, take my wheelchair.

01:24:06.184 --> 01:24:08.560
No!

01:24:08.602 --> 01:24:09.728
Great idea!

01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:11.022
Yeah, it'll be
a lot faster.

01:24:11.063 --> 01:24:12.356
Yeah, it will be faster.

01:24:12.397 --> 01:24:14.066
And I love
driving wheelchairs.

01:24:14.108 --> 01:24:15.526
It won't be any faster.

01:24:35.587 --> 01:24:36.881
Excuse me,
we're coming through.

01:24:36.922 --> 01:24:38.507
Look out buddy, sorry.

01:24:40.759 --> 01:24:41.719
You speak Chinese?

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.012
I studied Mandarin
for seven years.

01:24:43.054 --> 01:24:44.346
Your pronunciation's terrible.

01:24:44.388 --> 01:24:45.305
Seriously?

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:47.349
Oh, my God.

01:24:49.434 --> 01:24:50.686
Stand on my feet!
Stand on my feet!

01:24:50.728 --> 01:24:51.854
- What's wrong with it?
- It's jammed.

01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:53.272
- You guys go ahead.
- You sure?

01:24:53.313 --> 01:24:55.024
- I'm tired.
- All right, let's go.

01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:57.943
Oh, come on.

01:24:57.985 --> 01:25:01.113
Oh, that's nice.

01:25:02.114 --> 01:25:04.075
Sorry. Sorry.

01:25:04.116 --> 01:25:06.410
We're not gonna make it
with me running.

01:25:06.451 --> 01:25:07.245
What are we gonna do?

01:25:07.286 --> 01:25:08.662
Come on.

01:25:16.045 --> 01:25:17.046
Hey, buddy.

01:25:17.088 --> 01:25:19.048
Hey, man, I need
to borrow your bike.

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:20.091
Sorry, no.

01:25:20.132 --> 01:25:21.967
The love of my life
is getting away.

01:25:22.009 --> 01:25:23.135
I could give a shit.

01:25:23.177 --> 01:25:24.678
Will this do it?

01:25:26.097 --> 01:25:28.640
Shit, yes, you got
yourself a moped.

01:25:28.682 --> 01:25:29.808
- Thanks, buddy.
- All right.

01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:31.435
Just hang tight for
a moment all right?

01:25:31.476 --> 01:25:32.686
- No.
- Just a second.

01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:34.105
We just gotta get the
stuff out of the back.

01:25:34.146 --> 01:25:35.022
- Let's go.
- No, no, no.

01:25:35.064 --> 01:25:37.066
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:25:44.364 --> 01:25:46.117
Stop, stop.

01:25:46.158 --> 01:25:48.577
Oh, come on. Move!

01:25:48.619 --> 01:25:50.329
What is that?
Is that us?

01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:52.957
What is happening?

01:25:52.998 --> 01:25:54.083
Oh, my God!

01:25:54.125 --> 01:25:56.752
Who puts a dog
in a closed trunk?

01:25:56.794 --> 01:25:58.629
I don't have time
to care. You go.

01:25:58.670 --> 01:26:00.464
I'll take it back
to the people.

01:26:04.343 --> 01:26:06.971
Move! Move!

01:26:07.012 --> 01:26:08.973
Mandy, I'm coming!

01:26:22.402 --> 01:26:24.905
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:26:24.947 --> 01:26:26.490
I'm sorry.

01:26:26.531 --> 01:26:28.742
It's for love!

01:26:32.204 --> 01:26:34.206
Sorry, sorry.

01:26:34.248 --> 01:26:35.082
Hello?

01:26:35.124 --> 01:26:38.085
Hello, I need help.
Hello?

01:26:38.127 --> 01:26:40.254
Hey, son.
You need some help?

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:41.922
Yeah, is there a bus
going to Tennessee?

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.674
- Sure is.
- What time does it leave?

01:26:50.348 --> 01:26:51.765
I'm afraid you
just missed it.

01:26:54.185 --> 01:26:55.811
Matter of fact,
there it goes right there.

01:26:55.853 --> 01:26:57.604
- What?
- There.

01:27:01.692 --> 01:27:04.028
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus!

01:27:04.069 --> 01:27:07.447
Stop, stop, Mandy!

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:12.786
Did you sell
that boy a ticket?

01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:17.333
His ticket has been punched
by the god of love, Charlotte.

01:27:17.375 --> 01:27:19.543
You're fired.

01:27:19.584 --> 01:27:23.172
Bo?

01:27:23.214 --> 01:27:25.424
Don't you have
a Monster Jam to win?

01:27:25.465 --> 01:27:27.092
Mandy, don't leave.

01:27:27.134 --> 01:27:29.469
I'm an idiot.
I love you!

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:32.514
Oh, Bo, you had me
at jumpin' on the bus.

01:27:32.556 --> 01:27:35.309
- I did?
- Yeah.

01:27:35.351 --> 01:27:37.686
- I love you.
- Oh, thank God.

01:27:45.069 --> 01:27:47.196
Right there, uh-huh.

01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:57.831
Mom?

01:27:57.873 --> 01:27:59.750
And my new dad?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.002
You did it,
you big romantic lug.

01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:03.962
Yeah, turns out
she loves me!

01:28:04.004 --> 01:28:05.505
Oh, I know.

01:28:05.547 --> 01:28:06.965
Hey, how'd you
get here so fast?

01:28:07.007 --> 01:28:08.384
We took a cab.

01:28:08.426 --> 01:28:10.135
Oh, man, that's so smart.
I should have taken a cab.

01:28:10.177 --> 01:28:11.429
Oh, it was so fast,
just right here.

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:13.555
I was on a moped,
I ran into a Chinese guy,

01:28:13.597 --> 01:28:14.806
it was a whole thing.

01:28:14.848 --> 01:28:15.599
I hope he's okay.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.975
What about Monster Jam?

01:28:17.017 --> 01:28:18.936
We've already missed
the second event.

01:28:18.977 --> 01:28:20.645
Bo's probably
been disqualified.

01:28:20.687 --> 01:28:22.147
- Oh.
- Shit.

01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:24.275
Well, what about the money?

01:28:24.316 --> 01:28:26.151
Hey, Noodle,

01:28:26.193 --> 01:28:28.987
I was thinking about this while
I was riding on the moped,

01:28:29.029 --> 01:28:30.655
running into vegetables.

01:28:30.697 --> 01:28:33.117
Tommy was a winner
because had a family

01:28:33.158 --> 01:28:34.410
that cared about him.

01:28:34.452 --> 01:28:36.995
He had a dad that
gave him a clutch cable,

01:28:37.037 --> 01:28:40.458
helped him win that race.

01:28:40.499 --> 01:28:41.959
And that's what I got.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.461
I got people
that care about me.

01:28:43.502 --> 01:28:45.337
Eskie saved my life.

01:28:45.379 --> 01:28:47.131
You taught me how to swim.

01:28:47.172 --> 01:28:49.133
By the way I had a boner the
whole time we did that,

01:28:49.174 --> 01:28:50.259
and I didn't want
to tell you

01:28:50.301 --> 01:28:51.218
but now that we're together,

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.052
I had a boner then.

01:28:52.094 --> 01:28:53.262
That's so sweet!

01:28:53.304 --> 01:28:54.846
And you,
you figured out

01:28:54.888 --> 01:28:56.474
what was wrong
with that motorbike.

01:28:56.515 --> 01:28:58.434
How'd you know
that was me?

01:28:58.476 --> 01:29:01.437
You think this dingleberry
knows anything about an engine?

01:29:01.479 --> 01:29:04.398
All he knows is
kombucha and complaining.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.024
And prison.

01:29:06.066 --> 01:29:08.110
It was a... it wasn't...
it was a jail.

01:29:08.152 --> 01:29:09.361
It's not prison.

01:29:09.403 --> 01:29:12.197
Hey, guys, I don't need
to win the Monster Jam.

01:29:12.239 --> 01:29:13.740
I already won.

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:15.284
I got you guys.

01:29:15.326 --> 01:29:17.702
Oh, Bo.

01:29:17.744 --> 01:29:18.829
Get in here.

01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:20.747
Come on, I'm your new dad.

01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:22.416
- Come on, son.
- There you go.

01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:24.168
Oh, you get in here too.

01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:25.627
Okay.

01:29:34.178 --> 01:29:38.056
Ah, Hallelujah!

01:29:40.559 --> 01:29:42.520
Bo, my boy!

01:29:44.313 --> 01:29:46.690
Mr. Davis, you're alive?

01:29:46.731 --> 01:29:48.066
Yup!

01:29:48.108 --> 01:29:49.485
You are one
hell of a group.

01:29:49.527 --> 01:29:50.402
You're amazing.

01:29:50.444 --> 01:29:51.820
I mean, what the hell?

01:29:51.862 --> 01:29:53.322
This has been
a great adventure.

01:29:53.364 --> 01:29:55.615
Well, who would have known
I'd have to pretend to be dead

01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:58.035
just to feel
this much alive?

01:29:58.076 --> 01:29:59.370
Why would you?

01:29:59.411 --> 01:30:02.373
Oh, I screwed up with
those other two kids.

01:30:02.414 --> 01:30:04.249
Hell, I screwed up
with you, boy.

01:30:04.291 --> 01:30:06.251
I'm sorry I deserted
you and your mother.

01:30:06.293 --> 01:30:07.586
Hell, I thought you'd
only want that money.

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:11.131
But now look what
you've gone and done.

01:30:11.173 --> 01:30:12.591
You've gone and shown me
what's really important

01:30:12.632 --> 01:30:14.634
in this life.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.016
Bo?

01:30:21.058 --> 01:30:22.393
Bo, you all right?

01:30:22.434 --> 01:30:24.686
Bo, honey? You okay?

01:30:24.728 --> 01:30:27.147
You let me believe that
the father I never knew

01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:28.732
was dead this whole time?

01:30:28.773 --> 01:30:30.775
That I'd never even get
a chance to meet you?

01:30:30.817 --> 01:30:32.403
What the hell is
wrong with you?

01:30:32.444 --> 01:30:35.113
Well, hell, Bo, you had to...
had to prove yourself.

01:30:35.155 --> 01:30:38.658
A son should not have to
prove himself to his father.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.994
Maybe that's why your other
kids are such dickheads,

01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:43.121
- They took after you!
- Hey, Bo, wow.

01:30:43.163 --> 01:30:44.456
- That's ridiculous.
- No, he's a dick head.

01:30:44.498 --> 01:30:46.500
- Big old dick for a head.
- He's very emotional.

01:30:46.542 --> 01:30:48.752
But that was
the old me, Bo.

01:30:48.793 --> 01:30:50.003
This is the new me.

01:30:50.045 --> 01:30:51.838
Oh, the new you who flew
in on a giant chopper

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.591
acting like king
of the world?

01:30:53.632 --> 01:30:55.759
Well...

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.094
Helicopters are cool.

01:30:57.135 --> 01:30:58.762
Yeah, choppers are cool.

01:30:58.803 --> 01:31:00.722
That was so cool.

01:31:00.764 --> 01:31:03.141
I just wish you would have
done it thirty years ago

01:31:03.183 --> 01:31:05.561
when I needed you.

01:31:05.603 --> 01:31:07.062
Well, you're right there.
Maybe I should have.

01:31:07.104 --> 01:31:08.313
But then again,
maybe if I'd done it,

01:31:08.355 --> 01:31:10.148
then you wouldn't have
turned out to be the man

01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:12.276
that you are today.

01:31:12.317 --> 01:31:16.071
I had to be abandoned by
my father to become a man.

01:31:16.113 --> 01:31:17.781
That's a hell
of a lesson to learn.

01:31:17.822 --> 01:31:19.157
You're my dad, huh?

01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:22.411
Yes, sir,
I am your daddy.

01:31:22.453 --> 01:31:24.496
Okay, you know I made
a speech earlier

01:31:24.538 --> 01:31:26.331
about not wanting to
win the Monster Jam,

01:31:26.373 --> 01:31:28.875
but I want to win
the Monster Jam.

01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:31.795
Now you do realize that
my will don't mean anything,

01:31:31.836 --> 01:31:33.130
seeing that I'm alive.

01:31:33.171 --> 01:31:35.173
It's not about the money.
I need to prove myself.

01:31:35.215 --> 01:31:37.217
No, son, you don't need
to prove yourself.

01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:38.677
Not to you.

01:31:38.718 --> 01:31:40.804
I want to prove myself
to myself.

01:31:40.845 --> 01:31:43.723
Sometimes winning
is the only way to win.

01:31:47.561 --> 01:31:49.563
He's so smart.

01:31:49.605 --> 01:31:51.022
Now that's my son!

01:31:51.064 --> 01:31:52.857
Hell, I'd trust
my company in your hands

01:31:52.899 --> 01:31:53.984
any day of the week.

01:31:54.025 --> 01:31:55.611
Oh...

01:31:55.653 --> 01:31:57.529
Oh, uh, by the way,
what does your company make?

01:31:57.571 --> 01:31:59.490
Clutch cables!

01:31:59.531 --> 01:32:01.659
- Clutch cables?
- Bo.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.535
Hold on, clutch cables?

01:32:03.577 --> 01:32:05.329
Yeah, like...
for like motorbikes.

01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:07.331
Yeah, like the thing that
changed my whole life?

01:32:07.372 --> 01:32:09.625
That's ironic.

01:32:09.667 --> 01:32:12.419
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:12.461 --> 01:32:14.004
this night is
not over yet.

01:32:14.045 --> 01:32:15.631
Beauregard Jackson

01:32:15.673 --> 01:32:18.300
and is going to combine
his two wheel event

01:32:18.342 --> 01:32:20.885
and his freestyle event
into one,

01:32:20.927 --> 01:32:24.014
using the little known
Phineas rule.

01:32:24.055 --> 01:32:26.016
Earth to Bo,
can you hear me?

01:32:26.057 --> 01:32:28.686
Yeah, I hear ya
loud and clear.

01:32:28.727 --> 01:32:31.730
I talked to some of
the other gear heads.

01:32:31.771 --> 01:32:33.691
They told me this
will be a piece of cake.

01:32:33.732 --> 01:32:35.859
Well, I love cake.
Here we go.

01:32:43.701 --> 01:32:45.369

Hey, Noodle, I think
I'm gonna have to go big

01:34:11.413 --> 01:34:12.706
if I want to win
this thing.

01:34:12.748 --> 01:34:16.501
No, you don't.
Your dad's alive, remember?

01:34:16.543 --> 01:34:19.129
Yeah, of course I remember.
That just happened.

01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:22.466
Listen, I'm gonna
do a backflip.

01:34:22.507 --> 01:34:24.926
You'll turn upside down.

01:34:24.968 --> 01:34:26.511
I know.

01:34:26.553 --> 01:34:28.472
- No, he could hurt himself.
- What is he doing?

01:34:28.513 --> 01:34:29.931
Team Boodle.

01:34:32.183 --> 01:34:34.770
Team Boodle,
Dad Doodle.

01:34:34.812 --> 01:34:37.063
This is it.

01:34:38.523 --> 01:34:39.524
This is it.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:51.077
Go, go, go.
Go, Bo, go.

01:34:59.336 --> 01:35:02.840
Oh, Jackson
nailed a fantastic backflip!

01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:05.467
That might be enough
to get him on the podium.

01:35:12.098 --> 01:35:14.351
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:35:14.392 --> 01:35:17.020
Oh, looks like
Jackson isn't done yet.

01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.690
- What are you doing?
- I don't know!

01:35:24.486 --> 01:35:25.863
That there's another wall.

01:35:36.414 --> 01:35:37.749
How'd he do that?

01:35:37.791 --> 01:35:39.918

one and a quarter backflip,

01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:42.754

Hey, yeah, what?

01:35:47.843 --> 01:35:50.470
Okay, someone
get me out of here!

01:35:50.512 --> 01:35:54.015
You did it!
You got him through it.

01:35:54.057 --> 01:35:55.893
You did it.
I'm proud of you.

01:35:55.934 --> 01:35:58.269
- I'm so proud of you.
- It's okay, let it out.

01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:01.147
<i>Beauregard Davis Jackson,</i>

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:03.525
<i>that's me
and I am a winner.</i>

01:36:09.197 --> 01:36:10.574
<i>So that's
the story of how</i>

01:36:10.615 --> 01:36:13.201
<i>I did not take over
my father's company.</i>

01:36:13.243 --> 01:36:17.997
<i>And I learned that
I had a father.</i>

01:36:18.039 --> 01:36:19.666
<i>I help my Dad out
whenever he needs</i>

01:36:19.708 --> 01:36:22.586
<i>real good business advice,
but he's still in charge.</i>

01:36:22.627 --> 01:36:25.505
<i>He put Jason in charge
of new management policy</i>

01:36:25.547 --> 01:36:26.924
<i>at the company.</i>

01:36:26.965 --> 01:36:29.175
<i>No dicks allowed.
You know what I mean?</i>

01:36:35.724 --> 01:36:38.518
<i>Oswald became
a real racing fan.</i>

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.855
<i>And he found his dream gal,
one of the Heart Stopper girls.</i>

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.485
<i>Tommy spent thirteen days
in captivity</i>

01:36:47.527 --> 01:36:50.154
<i>before he was discovered
by search and rescue.</i>

01:36:50.196 --> 01:36:53.116
<i>He has devoted his life
to porta potty safety.</i>

01:36:56.286 --> 01:36:58.830
<i>Once his bones healed,
Eskandar took his love for speed</i>

01:36:58.872 --> 01:37:02.041
<i>and became a world-class
mustachioed drag racer.</i>

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:03.835
<i>And now he's back
in a wheelchair.</i>

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.716
<i>Chrissy still might take
over the company someday</i>

01:37:09.758 --> 01:37:11.551
<i>but my Dad is making her
learn the business</i>

01:37:11.593 --> 01:37:13.678
<i>from the ground up.</i>

01:37:19.977 --> 01:37:22.270
<i>Mandy became
a best selling author,</i>

01:37:22.312 --> 01:37:24.314
<i>breaking gender
and social stereotypes</i>

01:37:24.355 --> 01:37:27.609
<i>with her acclaimed book,
"Why Pink is for Boys".</i>

01:37:33.531 --> 01:37:35.450
- Team Boodle.
- Team Boodle.

01:37:35.492 --> 01:37:36.868
<i>Noodle and I,</i>

01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:39.496
<i>well, we make sure that
every kid gets a chance</i>

01:37:39.537 --> 01:37:40.872
<i>to feel like a winner.</i>

01:37:40.914 --> 01:37:42.499
<i>Welcome to Boodle Park.</i>

<i>Our own little slice
of country paradise.</i>

01:37:48.212 --> 01:37:50.298
Come on, come on,
come on, guys.

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.425
<i>Oh, I almost forgot
about myself.</i>

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:55.303
<i>I live in my hometown
with the greatest family</i>

01:37:55.345 --> 01:37:56.721
<i>a man could ever want.</i>

01:37:56.763 --> 01:37:59.557
<i>I have a beautiful wife,
two wonderful boys.</i>

01:37:59.599 --> 01:38:01.267
Get in here.

01:38:01.309 --> 01:38:03.854
<i>Sure, one boy's my age
and one boy's a baby,</i>

01:38:03.895 --> 01:38:05.313
<i>but they're both wonderful.</i>

01:38:05.355 --> 01:38:06.982
Put your arm
around your mom.

01:38:07.024 --> 01:38:09.400
<i>And I am a winner because
I have people who love me.</i>

01:38:09.442 --> 01:38:10.735
Oh, you guys
look beautiful.

01:38:10.777 --> 01:38:12.612
Here we go. Oh!

01:38:14.531 --> 01:38:16.115
I'm okay!

01:38:16.157 --> 01:38:17.241
Team Boodle.

01:38:25.333 --> 01:38:27.293
These colors, do not...

01:38:27.335 --> 01:38:29.170
I can't say that
with a straight face.

01:38:29.212 --> 01:38:31.882
These colors do not run...

01:38:31.923 --> 01:38:34.801
red, white,

01:38:34.843 --> 01:38:36.260
and Bo.

01:38:39.472 --> 01:38:40.682
Forget it, I quit.

01:38:40.724 --> 01:38:42.642
We quit!
Skandar, we quit.

01:38:42.684 --> 01:38:44.728
Everybody in line,
take your beef chips

01:38:44.769 --> 01:38:45.687
and shove 'em
up your buttholes.

01:38:45.729 --> 01:38:47.188
I'm done.

01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:49.232
He don't need us taking
care of him anymore.

01:38:49.273 --> 01:38:50.525
He's got Vanessa now.

01:38:50.567 --> 01:38:52.736
Yeah, well, Vanessa,
she's a piece.

01:38:52.777 --> 01:38:54.278
That's
what I'm worried about.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.449
Hold on, this is... I've never
had an iPhone before.

01:38:58.491 --> 01:39:00.911
You're a ray
of fucking sunshine.

01:39:00.952 --> 01:39:03.038
You're a ray
of fucking sunshine.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.206
You're a ray
of fucking sunshine.

01:39:05.248 --> 01:39:09.086
You can't say sunshine.

01:39:09.127 --> 01:39:11.046
You're a ray
of fucking sunshine.

01:39:15.008 --> 01:39:18.887
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

01:39:18.929 --> 01:39:20.931
God damn it.

01:39:20.972 --> 01:39:22.766
Fuck you.

01:39:29.064 --> 01:39:32.191
That may be the dumbest
fucking thing I've ever heard.

01:39:32.943 --> 01:39:36.195
Yeah, dick hole.

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:37.989
- Oswald.
- I was just trying it.

01:39:38.031 --> 01:39:39.574
That does not come...
that does not sound right

01:39:39.616 --> 01:39:40.909
- coming out of your mouth.
- I didn't...

01:39:40.951 --> 01:39:42.911
As I heard it,
it felt wrong.

01:39:42.953 --> 01:39:43.620
Yeah.

01:39:43.661 --> 01:39:45.496
Bo, I'm in!
I'm in!

01:39:45.538 --> 01:39:48.875
I'm in!

01:39:48.917 --> 01:39:51.962
All right!

01:39:52.003 --> 01:39:54.965
Got any Funyuns left?

01:39:55.006 --> 01:39:57.134
That had to be a trophy
winner there.

01:39:57.175 --> 01:39:59.177
Holy shit!

01:39:59.218 --> 01:40:01.345
You're a big boy,
aren't you?

01:40:01.387 --> 01:40:03.932
Might have to put you
through college.

01:40:03.974 --> 01:40:05.391
Woo!

01:40:05.433 --> 01:40:09.104
Can I lick on your neck?

01:40:09.146 --> 01:40:10.147
- Yes!
- I meant your boobies,

01:40:10.188 --> 01:40:11.522
I was just afraid to ask.

01:40:11.564 --> 01:40:13.399
Oh, God.

01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:15.443
You're so cute and dumb.

01:40:20.364 --> 01:40:21.365
Oh, my boy.

01:40:26.788 --> 01:40:29.373
It's there, you just
gotta hit that gas.

01:40:29.415 --> 01:40:30.708
What's-what's
my line there?

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:32.293
All right, Bo, now you're
gonna have to give it

01:40:32.335 --> 01:40:34.587
a little more... fuck.
What's my first line?

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:36.131
All right, Bo, you're
gonna have to give her

01:40:36.173 --> 01:40:38.341
a little more... fuck.
What's my first line again?

01:40:44.014 --> 01:40:45.473
Wait, the door is locked?

01:40:45.515 --> 01:40:46.975
Heart Stoppers?

01:40:47.017 --> 01:40:49.644
I do like taurine and gurana.

01:40:49.686 --> 01:40:51.938
Let me try that again.

01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.481
Heart Stoppers?

01:40:53.523 --> 01:40:56.067
I do like things that
taste like pennies.

01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:57.485
Heart Stoppers?

01:40:57.527 --> 01:41:02.157
Hmm, I do like unnecessary
violent energy.

01:41:02.199 --> 01:41:03.574
Heart stoppers?

01:41:03.616 --> 01:41:06.577
I do like sweating and
having suicidal thoughts.

01:41:08.538 --> 01:41:09.706
Act natural.

01:41:16.295 --> 01:41:18.631
Hit him in the knees.

01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:21.342
You know, like Tonya Harding
did to Nancy Kerrigan?

01:41:21.384 --> 01:41:22.677
What? No.

01:41:22.719 --> 01:41:24.554
That was terrible, she was
such a beautiful skater.

01:41:26.056 --> 01:41:28.683
Yeah, thanks for playing
you country piece of shit.

01:41:28.725 --> 01:41:30.768
- Okay.
- Walking rape kit.

01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:32.812
Okay.

01:41:32.854 --> 01:41:34.480
Bag of dicks.

01:41:34.522 --> 01:41:36.399
Nice to meet you.

01:41:44.615 --> 01:41:46.534
You look like you're in
the pushup position with like

01:41:46.576 --> 01:41:48.452
kind of throwing up
a little bit right there, yeah.

01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.210
- 'Cause I'm trying to...
- Shut up!

01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:59.297
It's easier
if you just shut up

01:41:59.338 --> 01:42:00.840
when she's close to you.

01:42:04.552 --> 01:42:06.054
Punch me, yeah,
you can try punching me

01:42:06.096 --> 01:42:09.724
in my face,
you fucking cock.

01:42:09.766 --> 01:42:12.393
- You wanna go?
- Jason, stand back.

01:42:12.435 --> 01:42:16.106
I work with this.
You think I can't take you?

01:42:16.147 --> 01:42:18.566
Oh, my God, that was...
that was really not safe.

01:42:18.608 --> 01:42:20.651
Not safe? Not...
it wasn't.

01:42:20.693 --> 01:42:22.279
You probably wear condoms,
don't you?

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.613
Oh, my God.

01:42:23.654 --> 01:42:25.949
You gotta roll the dice
once in a while my friend.

01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:28.492
You gotta live
on the edge.

01:42:28.534 --> 01:42:30.828
Like I feel like Scarface,
you know what I mean?

01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:32.205
I haven't seen it.

01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:33.957
- You look handsome with it.
- Thank you.

01:42:33.998 --> 01:42:35.333
You do, let me see it.

01:42:35.374 --> 01:42:37.168
Up, up by your...
oh, my God.

01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:38.461
Looking good.

01:42:38.502 --> 01:42:40.130
Who is he?

01:42:40.171 --> 01:42:42.840
Benjamin Franklin,
I just... I just said it.

01:42:42.882 --> 01:42:44.008
Oh, he was a president.

01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:45.885
- No, he wasn't a...
- He wasn't?

01:42:45.927 --> 01:42:46.886
Yes.

01:42:46.928 --> 01:42:48.429
Why'd they put him
on the money?

01:42:48.471 --> 01:42:51.432
This is some Illuminati shit
if you ask me.

01:42:51.474 --> 01:42:52.892
Okay.

01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:56.271
I was born deaf and then,
then a doctor fixed my ears

01:42:56.313 --> 01:42:59.190
and I had like
super sensor ears.

01:42:59.232 --> 01:43:01.067
Wow, that seems like
a whole different movie.

01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:03.402
I have, yeah,
I have a lot of ideas.

01:43:03.444 --> 01:43:06.530
Um, I-I wanna be a movie
star my whole life.

01:43:06.572 --> 01:43:09.159
I have this idea where
I'm in a racing movie

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.368
about me and a monkey,

01:43:10.409 --> 01:43:13.621
and it's called
"Going Bo-nannas".

01:43:13.663 --> 01:43:16.749
You know, like an action
series starring me

01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:18.542
and a Native American
named Arrow

01:43:18.584 --> 01:43:19.794
and it would be
"Bo and Arrow".

01:43:19.836 --> 01:43:21.338
And we solve mysteries,
you know?

01:43:21.379 --> 01:43:23.673
I don't know I just...
I got a lot going on

01:43:23.714 --> 01:43:24.799
right now, you know?

01:43:24.841 --> 01:43:26.968
This thing supposed
to be plugged in?

01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:28.136
I'm gonna go get a nurse.

01:43:28.178 --> 01:43:30.180
Oh, my God.

01:43:30.221 --> 01:43:32.515
Can you breathe?

01:43:32.556 --> 01:43:33.850
Can you...

01:43:33.891 --> 01:43:35.852
- Should I breathe into it?
- Yeah, breathe into it.

01:43:35.893 --> 01:43:37.436
Give him oxygen I guess.

01:43:39.272 --> 01:43:40.523
You can't
just ask these people,

01:43:40.564 --> 01:43:41.440
They're Californians.

01:43:41.482 --> 01:43:42.608
They re too high
all the time.

01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:43.526
They don't know
what you're saying.

01:43:43.567 --> 01:43:44.986
You know it's legal here?

01:43:45.028 --> 01:43:47.655
- It's legal!
- Sure.

01:43:47.697 --> 01:43:48.656
Motocross?

01:43:48.698 --> 01:43:49.907
Does he know how
to ride Motocross?

01:43:49.949 --> 01:43:52.827
He got balls, don't he?
He ain't no castrato.

01:43:52.869 --> 01:43:54.412
I don't know what that is.

01:43:54.453 --> 01:43:57.498
It's when you have your
dick and balls cut off.

01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.792
I thought it was the name
of a racer.

01:43:59.834 --> 01:44:00.918
He ain't him either.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.752
-Eric Castrato, you're right...

01:44:01.794 --> 01:44:02.670
-No that's the city.

01:44:02.712 --> 01:44:04.839
San Juan Castrato.

01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:07.425
Yup, I mean that
girl is hard to miss.

01:44:07.466 --> 01:44:11.304
On a scale of ten
she's an eighty.

01:44:11.346 --> 01:44:13.472
Or a sixty-nine, you know?

01:44:13.514 --> 01:44:15.933
No, I'm kidding.
I respect her too much.

01:44:17.977 --> 01:44:19.812
Yeah, I'm gonna marry her.

01:44:19.854 --> 01:44:21.647
Have babies.

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:23.274
Move to the country.

01:44:23.316 --> 01:44:24.692
- Yeah?
- You know, get a farm.

01:44:24.734 --> 01:44:27.153
Like three bedroom, two bath,
nothing over the top.

01:44:29.739 --> 01:44:30.865
Oh, my hair!

01:44:30.907 --> 01:44:33.826
Oh, it's not gonna be the
same after this.

01:44:33.868 --> 01:44:37.121
Noodles. Noodles.

01:44:37.163 --> 01:44:39.290
Noodles.

01:44:39.332 --> 01:44:40.833
- All right, now...
- Noodles.

01:44:40.875 --> 01:44:43.294
Steak would be good.

01:44:43.336 --> 01:44:46.130
Oh, I made contact
with his chin.

01:44:49.967 --> 01:44:51.677
Stop.

01:44:54.138 --> 01:44:55.514
Ooh-wee!

01:44:55.556 --> 01:44:57.850
You show 'em who's boss
with that Texas truck, Noodle.

01:44:57.892 --> 01:45:00.186
That's right, do it.

01:45:00.228 --> 01:45:02.272
City boy don't know
what's up.

01:45:02.313 --> 01:45:04.232
Don't know which way.

01:45:04.274 --> 01:45:06.317
Why don't you slap
his dick with your...

01:45:06.359 --> 01:45:07.777
There you go, nice.

01:45:10.821 --> 01:45:12.156
A little harder,
a little harder,

01:45:12.198 --> 01:45:14.451
there you go.
Hold on, hold on.

01:45:17.370 --> 01:45:19.038
That was... all right.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.164
Do you ever shut up?

01:45:20.206 --> 01:45:23.084
Yeah, I can if you just
give me the word

01:45:23.126 --> 01:45:24.377
and I'll stop talking.

01:45:24.419 --> 01:45:26.129
- Take my shoes off.
- Take your shoes off?

01:45:26.170 --> 01:45:27.338
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:29.299
That's pretty easy
for you to do yourself

01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:31.675
but I can... okay.

01:45:31.717 --> 01:45:33.636
Almost finished.

01:45:33.677 --> 01:45:34.929
Shake it off.

01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:38.475
Tap it out.

01:45:38.516 --> 01:45:40.518
Yup.

01:45:40.559 --> 01:45:41.519
Hi, man, nice to meet you.

01:45:44.355 --> 01:45:47.150
Good luck out...
are you okay?

01:45:47.191 --> 01:45:49.193
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:45:49.235 --> 01:45:50.361
Buddy?

01:45:50.403 --> 01:45:52.196
Oh, God.

01:45:52.238 --> 01:45:56.367
- Yeah, I'm gonna need that.
- Probably.

01:45:56.409 --> 01:45:59.203
All right, head in, then...

01:46:00.413 --> 01:46:02.332
Okay.

01:46:02.373 --> 01:46:04.250
- I'm good!
- Oh, you're real good.

01:46:04.292 --> 01:46:06.752
Are you a scientist?

01:46:06.794 --> 01:46:08.171
Kind of, I guess.

01:46:08.212 --> 01:46:11.590
I love stars.

01:46:11.632 --> 01:46:12.842
All right, Bo's about
to start, buddy.

01:46:12.883 --> 01:46:15.512
Bo's about to start.
Are you with me?

01:46:18.055 --> 01:46:19.723
- Do you need some help?
- No, no, I'm good.

01:46:19.765 --> 01:46:21.351
Push it, push it.

01:46:21.392 --> 01:46:23.686
I'm good, I'm good.

01:46:36.782 --> 01:46:38.742
He inherits nothing!

01:46:40.786 --> 01:46:42.497
Oh, you get in here too.

01:46:42.539 --> 01:46:44.748
Okay.

01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:46.834
- You've been Boodled.
- You're strong.

01:46:46.876 --> 01:46:48.211
I've got a boner again.

01:46:50.921 --> 01:46:51.881
Cut.

01:46:58.679 --> 01:46:59.687
