<i>- Previously on royal pains...
- Dr. Emily peck.</i>

00:03.191 --> 00:04.286
I'm dr. Lawson's replacement.

00:04.470 --> 00:05.580
- Why would he need replacing?

00:05.616 --> 00:08.282
Schmoozing patients and pushing
spa treatments on them.

00:08.283 --> 00:09.875
Dr. Peck...

00:11.626 --> 00:13.345
- This thing you have,
it's genetic.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.791
- Quite fatal.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.097
- So he summoned you
to the manor?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.348
- No, to his winter residence.
- Welcome to cuba.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.263
- Dr. Casseras
has diagnosed me, hank.

00:20.264 --> 00:22.569
I flew down here because
she has a clinical trial.

00:22.570 --> 00:24.672
- Welcome to the team,
dr. Quarterback.

00:24.673 --> 00:26.513
- Is boris in a long-distance
relationship?

00:26.514 --> 00:28.185
- You're not symptomatic,
you feel fine.

00:28.186 --> 00:29.925
Participating
in this unproven trial

00:29.926 --> 00:31.262
Could change all that.

00:31.263 --> 00:32.499
- I think he has
a new quarterback.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.205
- My sister works
in the factory.

00:34.206 --> 00:35.409
- Oh, my god.
Look away.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.883
Look away, go.
Hurry.

00:36.884 --> 00:38.253
- I'm sorry
you won't be staying.

00:38.254 --> 00:39.323
- I'm sorry
you won't be leaving.

00:39.324 --> 00:40.627
- Have you seen my brother?

00:44.104 --> 00:47.110
Ean t tic]lasimu

00:47.111 --> 00:54.786
âª âª

01:00.225 --> 01:03.461
- Was our farewell handshake
unsatisfactory, hank?

01:03.462 --> 01:06.063
Or have you changed your mind
about leaving?

01:06.064 --> 01:07.831
- I'm still leaving,
once evan shows up.

01:07.832 --> 01:10.967
I think he's having separation
anxiety from this place.

01:10.968 --> 01:12.335
- Well, join us, then.

01:12.336 --> 01:13.636
Marisa and I
were just discussing

01:13.637 --> 01:15.404
What I can anticipate next
in her clinical trial.

01:15.405 --> 01:16.671
- Yeah, I don't know if
there's much I can add

01:16.672 --> 01:18.172
To that discussion.

01:18.173 --> 01:20.608
Aside from wishing you both
the best of luck.

01:20.609 --> 01:23.109
- It's about science,
not luck.

01:23.110 --> 01:25.144
- Science makes predictions,
not promises.

01:25.145 --> 01:30.114
- Have a pleasant flight,
dr. Lawson.

01:30.115 --> 01:31.282
I'll see you
at the institute.

01:31.283 --> 01:32.617
- Yes, you will.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.753
- You're worried
about me, hank.

01:37.754 --> 01:40.019
Believe me, I'm...

01:40.020 --> 01:42.754
Under no illusions
about my odds.

01:42.755 --> 01:45.123
I'd just rather play them
than sit out the hand.

01:45.124 --> 01:46.490
- Right, but you're
emotionally entangled

01:46.491 --> 01:48.292
With the dealer.

01:48.293 --> 01:50.527
The house tends
to frown on that.

01:50.528 --> 01:53.262
I just think you and marisa
need to make a choice,

01:53.263 --> 01:54.763
Decide what you
want from each other.

01:54.764 --> 01:58.499
- That your medical opinion
or a personal one?

01:58.500 --> 02:00.600
- Maybe a little bit of both.

02:11.911 --> 02:13.911
- Why are we stopping?

02:13.912 --> 02:15.846
Where are we?
Guys?

02:15.847 --> 02:18.815
Hello?

02:18.816 --> 02:20.416
Oh, okay. Okay.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.018
Okay, please, don't hurt me.

02:22.019 --> 02:23.686
Don't hurt me.
Just talk to me.

02:23.687 --> 02:25.354
I'm a very good listener.
Just tell me what you want.

02:33.159 --> 02:35.059
- Oh, okay, I failed spanish
in school,

02:35.060 --> 02:36.060
But I think I just heard
the words

02:36.061 --> 02:37.094
"american" and "death."

02:37.095 --> 02:38.195
So can we just calm down?

02:38.196 --> 02:39.296
Does anybody
speak english here?

02:39.297 --> 02:42.431
- I'm sorry, no one
is gonna hurt--

02:42.432 --> 02:43.532
You!

02:43.533 --> 02:45.734
- You're the bartender.

02:45.735 --> 02:48.536
What--you're the cigar guy.

02:48.537 --> 02:51.538
And you're--
you're gigantic.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.341
Um...Was it the tip?

02:54.342 --> 02:55.608
Was it the phone?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.042
Could you not
download the widgets?

02:57.043 --> 02:58.176
I had a problem with that.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.176
- Oscar should not
have brought you here.

02:59.177 --> 03:00.911
But since you are here,

03:00.912 --> 03:03.813
And if you'll forgive us,
we need your help.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.181
Come.
- Wha--

03:05.182 --> 03:06.749
- Believe me, all I want
is to get out of here

03:06.750 --> 03:08.084
And get back to normal.

03:08.085 --> 03:10.019
- Then you may not want
to land in the hamptons.

03:10.020 --> 03:13.321
- Uh, look, boris arranged
for a dr. Peck to hang around.

03:13.322 --> 03:15.023
So any issues,
just call her.

03:15.024 --> 03:16.090
- I'd rather die.

03:16.091 --> 03:17.391
- I'm sorry, what was that?

03:17.392 --> 03:18.759
You broke up.
- I said...

03:18.760 --> 03:20.661
What a guy.

03:20.662 --> 03:23.229
Any issues,
and I'll give her a call.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.764
Now, you have a safe trip.

03:24.765 --> 03:26.598
And good luck finding evan.

03:26.599 --> 03:29.401
- Okay, bye.

03:29.402 --> 03:30.768
- I was helping my uncle
take out the engine bolts

03:30.769 --> 03:32.170
Using the pickup truck.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.938
But the crowbar slipped
and his hand got caught.

03:33.939 --> 03:37.007
- I sent them
to get my cousin, a nurse--

03:37.008 --> 03:38.342
- But we couldn't find her.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.410
And then I saw you.

03:39.411 --> 03:41.345
- Please, doctor.
Help my uncle.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.281
<i>- Por favor! Hermano!</i>

03:44.282 --> 03:45.682
I can't feel my hand.

03:45.683 --> 03:48.217
- Oh, god. Okay.
- Please, hurry.

03:48.218 --> 03:50.552
- I know, look.
I really want to help you.

03:50.553 --> 03:52.687
I want to help him,
but I'm not a doctor.

03:52.688 --> 03:55.355
- Yes, you are.
You're hankmed.

03:55.356 --> 03:56.690
- No, I'm--this--
hankmed.

03:56.691 --> 03:58.358
That's my brother's name,
is hank.

03:58.359 --> 04:00.293
I'm evan. You kidnapped
the wrong brother.

04:03.097 --> 04:04.897
- You need to call him
an ambulance right now.

04:04.898 --> 04:07.032
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.700
- Because he's already dead.

04:16.869 --> 04:18.503
âª âª

04:18.504 --> 04:23.506
- âª my independence went away âª

04:23.507 --> 04:27.942
âª I didn't listen
when it said âª

04:27.943 --> 04:30.276
âª rely on yourself âª

04:30.277 --> 04:32.578
âª trusting someone else âª

04:32.579 --> 04:37.446

04:47.952 --> 04:49.386
- Hank?

04:49.387 --> 04:50.520
- Hello?

04:50.521 --> 04:51.654
- Hank!

04:51.655 --> 04:53.289
Hank...

04:53.290 --> 04:55.224
Hank!
- Hey, the bartender.

04:55.225 --> 04:56.258
How'd you know
where to find me?

04:56.259 --> 04:57.459
- Your brother sent me.

04:57.460 --> 04:59.126
He told me he landed
his jet here,

04:59.127 --> 05:00.792
And there's only one
man around here

05:00.793 --> 05:02.327
With a runway
in his backyard.

05:02.328 --> 05:04.128
- Wait, I'm sorry.
Evan sent you?

05:04.129 --> 05:05.496
- Yeah, there's been
an accident.

05:05.497 --> 05:07.264
- He's hurt? Again?
- No, he's okay,

05:07.265 --> 05:09.299
But we need a doctor, hank.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.300
He told me that you would come.

05:10.301 --> 05:11.334
- Uh, yeah.

05:11.335 --> 05:12.936
- Thank you.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.770
- Let's go.

05:19.609 --> 05:22.077
- Extra-dry soy caramel latte,

05:22.078 --> 05:24.480
Uh, one skinny macchiato.

05:24.481 --> 05:26.848
Two extra foam,
no fat.

05:26.849 --> 05:27.849
- Hey there.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.718
- Hey.
- Hey! No cutting.

05:29.719 --> 05:32.520
- I'm joining my friend.

05:34.722 --> 05:38.123
Invasion of the citiots.

05:38.124 --> 05:40.525
- I just want a black coffee.

05:40.526 --> 05:42.293
Why can't they have
a separate line

05:42.294 --> 05:44.528
For regular people?

05:44.529 --> 05:47.397
- You think paying $4
for a cup of coffee is regular?

05:47.398 --> 05:50.066
- Fair point.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.634
- So...Favor to ask.

05:51.635 --> 05:54.703
A bunch of us are going to see
a friend's band after work.

05:54.704 --> 05:56.137
They're opening
for jane's recovery.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.705
- Who's jane
and what happened to her?

05:57.706 --> 06:00.074
- It's a jane's addiction
cover band.

06:00.075 --> 06:02.743
Is there any way I could
convince you to come?

06:02.744 --> 06:04.310
- Today?
- Yeah, at the ratskeller,

06:04.311 --> 06:06.012
The beer garden on 27th.

06:06.013 --> 06:07.279
- Yes, I've driven past.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.480
Quickly.

06:08.481 --> 06:10.148
- Well,
it's my favorite dive.

06:10.149 --> 06:13.284
But I am dreading
the crowd.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.518
All my old friends
are married,

06:14.519 --> 06:16.153
And I will spend
the whole time saying,

06:16.154 --> 06:17.888
"thank you, but, no,

06:17.889 --> 06:19.589
"I do not want to be
fixed up with your friend

06:19.590 --> 06:21.224
"or your brother or, heh heh,

06:21.225 --> 06:24.527
Your cousin wally who runs
an exotic bird hospital."

06:24.528 --> 06:27.529
But if you came...
I could avoid all of that.

06:27.530 --> 06:28.930
- I'm on call.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.532
I-I can't drink.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.566
- Then the first round's
on me.

06:34.336 --> 06:36.036
- Oh, my god,
I've got a patient.

06:36.037 --> 06:38.371
Okay, I've got to go.
I'm sorry.

06:38.372 --> 06:40.773
Tonight...
It's just not my scene.

06:43.576 --> 06:45.343
- Okay, now you are cutting.

06:45.344 --> 06:47.178
- Look, pal,
you left the city.

06:47.179 --> 06:48.912
Chill.

06:48.913 --> 06:50.313
he's in hiding.

06:50.314 --> 06:51.647
But he's not a criminal,
he's a--

06:51.648 --> 06:53.182
He's a writer who made fun
of the government.

06:53.183 --> 06:54.483
<i>So it's kind of like
the daily show,</i>

06:54.484 --> 06:55.751
But without the show.

06:55.752 --> 06:57.587
Anyway, he could
get arrested or worse.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.223
- Take a deep breath.
Try to relax.

06:59.224 --> 07:00.558
- They meant to kidnap you,
actually,

07:00.559 --> 07:01.625
'cause you're the doc--
- you too, evan.

07:01.626 --> 07:02.860
Deep breath.

07:02.861 --> 07:04.028
- We didn't try
to kidnap anyone.

07:04.029 --> 07:06.163
My little brother panicked.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.698
- I was trying to help.

07:07.699 --> 07:09.066
- Yeah, like you
helped with the car?

07:11.702 --> 07:12.868
- What do you think, doctor?

07:12.869 --> 07:14.537
- All right, your ring

07:14.538 --> 07:16.038
Is holding the blades apart.

07:16.039 --> 07:18.507
But your finger's too swollen
to risk pulling it out.

07:18.508 --> 07:20.475
- So that means what?

07:20.476 --> 07:21.509
Amputate?

07:21.510 --> 07:22.943
- Amputate?

07:22.944 --> 07:25.545
- No, no, no, no. No.
Let's try to limit the damage.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.580
Uh, what I need
is some very thin string,

07:28.581 --> 07:30.719
Fishing line, uh, ideally--

07:30.720 --> 07:32.954
- Dental floss.
- Yeah, very resourceful.

07:32.955 --> 07:34.755
- My sister's not just
the beauty of the family.

07:34.756 --> 07:36.256
She's also the brains.

07:36.257 --> 07:37.957
- Yeah, maybe you could learn
a little from her,

07:37.958 --> 07:39.225
Eh, [speaks spanish]?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.793
- She rolls a mean cigar
as well, huh?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.027
Or is that
your other sister?

07:42.028 --> 07:45.464
- I'm their only sister.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.832
He didn't
sell you cigars?

07:46.833 --> 07:48.333
<i>- You are still cheating
the turistos</i>

07:48.334 --> 07:49.735
With the homemade rip-offs?

07:49.736 --> 07:51.403
- Whoa, whoa...

07:51.404 --> 07:52.437
You sold me fakes?

07:54.440 --> 07:56.674
I can get over
this kidnapping thing.

07:56.675 --> 07:57.809
I get it.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.812
But counterfeit cohibas?

08:00.813 --> 08:03.914
That is...
Morally bankrupt, man.

08:03.915 --> 08:06.649
- No, we'll pay you back.
Every peso.

08:06.650 --> 08:10.485
- I thought we had a connection.

08:10.486 --> 08:12.286
- People! People!

08:12.287 --> 08:14.788
Can we argue about this after
we save your uncle's finger?

08:16.823 --> 08:17.890
<i>- Gracias.</i>

08:22.328 --> 08:23.428
- Okay.

08:35.470 --> 08:36.936
okay? Okay, all right.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.504
All right, we're almost
to the bottom.

08:38.505 --> 08:39.837
We're almost at the bottom.

08:47.813 --> 08:49.680
- All right.
Put this through.

08:56.253 --> 08:57.486
Ohh!

08:57.487 --> 08:59.322
- There we go, there we go.

08:59.323 --> 09:00.858
- Okay...Okay...

09:04.196 --> 09:05.362
- Here we go.
Here we go.

09:05.363 --> 09:07.764
We're pulling it out.
Pull.

09:07.765 --> 09:09.232
Good, good.

09:09.233 --> 09:10.400
Good...Good...

09:10.401 --> 09:12.468
- Oh, wow.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.003
- Okay, and...Pull!

09:19.707 --> 09:23.609
<i>- Gracias.</i>

09:30.916 --> 09:34.153
- Hello, I'm back for
mr. Kassabian's follow--

09:34.154 --> 09:35.688
- All followed up already.

09:35.689 --> 09:39.191
Thank you.

09:39.192 --> 09:40.926
I was told
to expect your call,

09:40.927 --> 09:42.928
Which never came.

09:42.929 --> 09:45.864
Fortunately, I remembered
our first appointment.

09:45.865 --> 09:47.499
- Dr. Peck...

09:47.500 --> 09:50.702
Obviously, I find it awkward
to be working together again

09:50.703 --> 09:53.538
After my unsolicited critique
of you yesterday.

09:53.539 --> 09:55.339
- I didn't take it personally.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.774
- It was...Inappropriate.

09:57.775 --> 09:59.342
- But not unexpected.

09:59.343 --> 10:01.742
I went to medical school
with women like you

10:01.743 --> 10:03.244
Who don't like other women.

10:03.245 --> 10:05.579
<i>Course, they're
all doctors now.</i>

10:05.580 --> 10:07.214
- Excuse me?

10:07.215 --> 10:11.217
- Women make you defensive
and territorial.

10:11.218 --> 10:12.918
You'd rather
keep your distance.

10:12.919 --> 10:16.221
- I get along with women
quite well.

10:16.222 --> 10:19.724
- So you do have
close female friends?

10:22.093 --> 10:25.528
- I just had coffee
with my good friend jill.

10:25.529 --> 10:26.963
We are very tight.

10:26.964 --> 10:29.098
Not that it
is your business.

10:29.099 --> 10:31.067
- Well, then, I'm wrong.

10:31.068 --> 10:32.801
It was personal.

10:32.802 --> 10:35.971
And you owe me an apology.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.810
- So when the boat I tried
to escape on sank,

10:43.811 --> 10:44.911
They thought I was dead.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.079
- Which meant you were safe

10:46.080 --> 10:46.980
As long as you
stayed in hiding.

10:46.981 --> 10:48.147
<i>- Exactamente.</i>

10:48.148 --> 10:50.382
<i>- Tengo fichas;
puedes jugar?</i>

10:50.383 --> 10:52.150
- What did he just call me?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.853
- He asked if you
played dominoes.

10:56.355 --> 10:57.956
- Uh, no.
No, I don't.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.791
But I'll watch.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.293
- So I am safe here,

11:02.294 --> 11:04.628
But it is carmen now
who takes all the risk,

11:04.629 --> 11:06.329
At the nightclub
where she works.

11:06.330 --> 11:07.863
- It's still your writing.

11:07.864 --> 11:09.965
- She uses the internet there
to post my columns

11:09.966 --> 11:11.332
Under a false name.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.833
- And pours a mean drink
on the side.

11:14.603 --> 11:16.603
- There you go.
Okay.

11:20.408 --> 11:22.609
- You are kind to help us.

11:22.610 --> 11:24.911
Is there anything
we can do to repay you?

11:24.912 --> 11:26.078
- No, no, no.
Thank you.

11:26.079 --> 11:27.413
I'm just glad
your uncle's okay.

11:27.414 --> 11:29.114
I'm gonna give him
a tetanus shot

11:29.115 --> 11:31.183
And leave you with some
antibiotic cream.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.953
I am very grateful.

11:34.954 --> 11:37.221
- Oh, I'm just glad
I could help.

11:37.222 --> 11:39.390
Let me see your hand.

11:41.192 --> 11:42.792
- Is there something wrong?

11:51.299 --> 11:52.599
- Come on, bro.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.367
Let's play.

11:54.368 --> 11:57.035
I'll teach you.
It'll be a peace offering.

11:57.036 --> 11:58.269
- Uh-huh.

11:58.270 --> 12:00.104
How about peace offering
my phone back?

12:00.105 --> 12:01.839
- I don't have it on me.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.708
I--we'll get it
when I drive you back to town.

12:03.709 --> 12:07.879
- You shafted me, dude.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.349
- And trading a $300 phone
for $1,000 cigars?

12:11.350 --> 12:13.917
That's not a shafting?

12:13.918 --> 12:15.185
Come on, papi,
let's get past it

12:15.186 --> 12:16.753
And have a game.

12:25.228 --> 12:26.728
- Have you had
any fevers recently?

12:26.729 --> 12:28.596
- It's July in cuba.

12:28.597 --> 12:29.730
Who can tell?

12:29.731 --> 12:32.466
- Is everything okay?

12:32.467 --> 12:35.302
Hank, you're scaring me.

12:35.303 --> 12:38.338
- I noticed splinter hemorrhages
under your uncle's nails,

12:38.339 --> 12:39.973
A murmur when
I listened to your heart,

12:39.974 --> 12:41.441
And raw spots
on your retinas.

12:41.442 --> 12:43.109
Those are signs
of endocarditis,

12:43.110 --> 12:44.743
An infection of the heart.

12:44.744 --> 12:46.511
- Is it dangerous?

12:46.512 --> 12:49.146
- Not if you catch it
before there's valve damage,

12:49.147 --> 12:50.681
But to detect that,
he needs an echo

12:50.682 --> 12:51.748
In a hospital.

12:51.749 --> 12:53.483
- No, he could
be recognized.

12:53.484 --> 12:56.386
- You see, cubans are forced
to be informers.

12:56.387 --> 12:59.155
Otherwise, they get accused
of being traitors themselves.

13:00.924 --> 13:02.624
Okay, I have access
to a facility.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.193
We could do it there
and be discreet.

13:05.194 --> 13:06.528
- Still a big risk.

13:06.529 --> 13:08.096
- And one we should take.

13:08.097 --> 13:10.031
Or your uncle could be dead
for real.

13:18.649 --> 13:21.151
âª âª

13:21.152 --> 13:22.919
- You get him his phone.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.488
Okay? We'll come find you
when we know something.

13:25.489 --> 13:28.057
- Maybe.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.526
- Follow me.

13:30.527 --> 13:32.728
- Where are we going?
This is--

13:32.729 --> 13:34.663
I just want my phone.

13:34.664 --> 13:35.897
- There it is.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.998
Dude.

13:47.038 --> 13:48.540
<i>- Telefono.</i>

13:51.210 --> 13:53.444
- He says it's not for sale.

13:53.445 --> 13:55.346
- How much did you
get for it?

13:55.347 --> 13:57.348
- Insurance.

13:57.349 --> 13:58.683
- What?
What kind of insurance?

13:58.684 --> 13:59.917
- Health.

13:59.918 --> 14:00.951
- Oh.

14:15.565 --> 14:16.765
- Did you just offer
your shoes

14:16.766 --> 14:18.366
To the guy you pay
for insurance?

14:18.367 --> 14:19.768
- You have a better idea.

14:19.769 --> 14:22.437
- Yeah, I have a better idea.

14:22.438 --> 14:24.005
- We play for it.

14:24.006 --> 14:25.273
Unless you think
he'll just kill us

14:25.274 --> 14:26.540
And take the money anyway.

14:26.541 --> 14:28.542
- No, that would
disrespect the dominos.

14:28.543 --> 14:29.743
- That's good enough
reason for me.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.212
- But are you any good?

14:32.213 --> 14:34.380
- I used to be.

14:34.381 --> 14:36.548
<i>- Ay, dios mio.</i>

14:36.549 --> 14:40.051
- âª when daylight comes âª

14:40.052 --> 14:43.654
âª when daylight comes âª

14:43.655 --> 14:45.756
âª âª

14:45.757 --> 14:47.224
- I'm glad you
changed your mind.

14:47.225 --> 14:48.759
- I wish I'd
changed my clothes.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.761
- Into what, something
from last season's

14:50.762 --> 14:52.196
Stella mccartney collection?

14:52.197 --> 14:54.932
- I own jeans
and a concert t-shirt.

14:54.933 --> 14:57.534
- Really?
What concert?

14:57.535 --> 15:00.036
- Itzhak perlman
at tanglewood.

15:00.037 --> 15:02.071
- You're just full
of surprises.

15:02.072 --> 15:04.607
- Jill mcgillicuddy?

15:04.608 --> 15:06.475
oh, my god.

15:06.476 --> 15:08.543
Were were just
talking about you!

15:08.544 --> 15:09.778
- Hey, debbie.

15:09.779 --> 15:12.612
- Hey! Get over here.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.215
So, uh, we all
want to know the deetz

15:16.216 --> 15:17.983
On what went down
with you and charlie.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.522
- Uh, "the deetz"?

15:19.523 --> 15:20.755
- Yeah, I mean,
you guys seemed like

15:20.756 --> 15:22.756
The perfect couple.

15:22.757 --> 15:24.024
What happened?

15:24.025 --> 15:25.325
- Yeah, I, um...

15:25.326 --> 15:26.993
- Hey, do you want
to grab a drink?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.727
- I'd love to.

15:28.728 --> 15:29.828
I'll be right back.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.063
- Oh.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.131
- Thank you.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.599
- Did she say,
uh, mcgillicuddy?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.768
- Maiden name.
Not going back to it.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.903
You have no idea
how I've suffered.

15:39.904 --> 15:41.739
- I'm sure I'll find out
soon enough.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.406
- You mean,
after you marry raj?

15:43.407 --> 15:46.676
- Yes, I'll be, uh,
divya bandyopadhyay.

15:46.677 --> 15:49.512
Just rolls off
the tongue, huh?

15:55.985 --> 15:57.686
- Okay, um...

15:57.687 --> 15:59.721
I need you
to distract the guard.

15:59.722 --> 16:02.056
- Wait, I thought you say
you have access here.

16:02.057 --> 16:04.424
- Hey, access doesn't make
an off-the-books echocardiogram,

16:04.425 --> 16:06.626
Uh, what's spanish
for "kosher"?

16:06.627 --> 16:08.761
- Kosher.
- Oh.

16:08.762 --> 16:10.863
All right, maybe if you
pretend to be lost

16:10.864 --> 16:11.897
Or something?

16:11.898 --> 16:14.033
- Uh, hank, I'm a bartender.

16:14.034 --> 16:16.635
I know how to...
Get a man's attention.

16:16.636 --> 16:18.636
Excuse me.

16:22.873 --> 16:26.441
- She is single,
if you are wondering.

16:26.442 --> 16:28.243
- Uh, excuse--
excuse me?

16:28.244 --> 16:30.978
- My niece does not
have a boyfriend.

16:30.979 --> 16:34.216
- Oh, uh...
O-okay.

16:34.217 --> 16:36.752
- She's too busy taking care
of us to find the right man,

16:36.753 --> 16:39.454
So I am always hoping
the right man

16:39.455 --> 16:42.523
Will find her.

16:44.292 --> 16:47.294
- All right, let's go.

16:48.496 --> 16:50.530
Okay, great.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.566
Great, uh, okay.

16:52.567 --> 16:54.467
Lie down.
Take your shirt off, please.

16:54.468 --> 16:55.902
- All right.
- Great.

16:55.903 --> 16:57.403
Perfect.

16:57.404 --> 16:59.404
- Hank, how does this work?

16:59.405 --> 17:00.806
- All right, I'll, uh,

17:00.807 --> 17:02.173
I'll run this transducer
over your chest,

17:02.174 --> 17:03.374
Which will let me know
if the endocarditis

17:03.375 --> 17:04.540
Has done any damage.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.209
- Everything okay?

17:06.210 --> 17:07.542
- Yeah, yeah.
We've been pretty lucky,

17:07.544 --> 17:09.711
Up until now.
Damn it.

17:09.712 --> 17:10.813
- What is wrong?

17:10.814 --> 17:12.714
- Without this,
I won't get a picture.

17:12.714 --> 17:14.482
- Should we search
for a supply room?

17:14.483 --> 17:15.817
- No, I shld talk
to dr. Casseras.

17:15.818 --> 17:17.018
She's the head of the clinic.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.685
- No, no, no, no, no.
That is too dangerous.

17:18.685 --> 17:20.954
- She won't know your name,
just that I have a patient.

17:20.954 --> 17:22.387
Look, the longer this takes,

17:22.388 --> 17:23.589
The more we risk
someone discovering you.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.390
- This dr. Casseras...

17:25.391 --> 17:28.392
You trust her?

17:28.393 --> 17:30.060
- I think it's our best shot.

17:30.061 --> 17:31.895
- What if someone comes
while you're gone?

17:31.896 --> 17:33.230
- Right, uh...

17:33.231 --> 17:34.731
Okay. Okay!

17:34.732 --> 17:37.000
Here, put this on.

17:37.001 --> 17:38.401
Anyone asks, you say,

17:38.402 --> 17:39.803
What do I look like,
the charge nurse?

17:39.804 --> 17:43.206
They'll think you're a doctor.
I guarantee it.

17:44.609 --> 17:47.611
- So what's going on
with hank?

17:47.612 --> 17:49.646
- He's very busy,

17:49.647 --> 17:51.180
I'm sure.

17:51.181 --> 17:53.515
- Yeah.

17:53.516 --> 17:54.716
- Jill...

17:54.717 --> 17:56.184
Please don't take this
the wrong way.

17:56.185 --> 17:59.920
Because I'd like for us
to become close female friends

17:59.921 --> 18:03.156
Who are comfortable
discussing anything.

18:03.157 --> 18:05.792
But...Since hank is my boss,

18:05.793 --> 18:08.460
Maybe your relationship
is a topic that we should avoid.

18:08.461 --> 18:11.463
- Oh, uh...

18:11.464 --> 18:13.732
Okay.
Sure.

18:13.733 --> 18:15.700
But, for the record,

18:15.701 --> 18:17.134
<i>I just meant
where is hank?</i>

18:17.135 --> 18:19.203
- Oh!

18:19.204 --> 18:21.337
He's in cuba.

18:21.338 --> 18:24.373
- Cuba?

18:24.374 --> 18:26.375
Oh...

18:26.376 --> 18:28.010
Well, I guess I have
lots of questions

18:28.011 --> 18:29.878
That I won't bother asking.

18:29.879 --> 18:32.580
- I'm sorry, I didn't--

18:32.581 --> 18:34.515
- Mm-mm! No, no.

18:34.516 --> 18:36.316
You're right.

18:36.317 --> 18:37.784
Hank is our
original connection,

18:37.785 --> 18:39.819
But we should have
a direct connection too.

18:39.820 --> 18:41.454
No middleman.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.555
Woman to woman,

18:42.556 --> 18:43.556
Hank-free.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.923
- Cheers to that.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.892
- All right.
- Oh, hey.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.760
Don't you know it's bad luck
to toast with water?

18:49.761 --> 18:52.063
Let me buy you
a more festive drink.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.732
- It's a club soda,
and, no, thank you.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.434
oh, english, are you?

18:56.435 --> 18:59.204
How's about a guinness, then,
eh, guv'nor?

18:59.205 --> 19:00.505
- How cultured.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.840
Again...No, thank you.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.042
- Come on.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.444
This is a beer garden,
not a...Seltzer garden.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.312
- She said no, dennis.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.580
- Well, look who's changed
since high school

19:10.581 --> 19:11.914
And talks to me now.

19:11.915 --> 19:13.615
- And look who hasn't

19:13.616 --> 19:16.982
And is still
an arrogant douche bag.

19:16.983 --> 19:19.083
- You two aren't, like,
together, are you?

19:19.084 --> 19:21.688
- If I said yes,
would you go away?

19:21.689 --> 19:24.257
- You say yes, I want to see
what else you'll yes to.

19:24.258 --> 19:27.526
- You're sick.
- Yeah, what do you know?

19:27.527 --> 19:30.462
- I run a hospital.
Bye-bye.

19:37.068 --> 19:38.301
Dr. Casseras?

19:39.870 --> 19:41.771
<i>- Gracias.</i>

19:50.245 --> 19:51.945
- Boris.

19:51.946 --> 19:55.482
- Hank, you're not still
waiting for your brother?

19:55.483 --> 19:58.184
- No, uh, I found him.

19:58.185 --> 19:59.652
Are you okay?

19:59.653 --> 20:02.020
- I am, yes.

20:02.021 --> 20:03.355
You're not here
to check up on me?

20:03.356 --> 20:05.990
- No, uh, I was looking
for dr. Casseras.

20:05.991 --> 20:07.325
- Well, you're a little late.

20:07.326 --> 20:09.460
We've moved
to the next step, hank.

20:09.461 --> 20:12.863
- Yeah, I can see that.

20:12.864 --> 20:15.698
Uh, I need to do
an echocardiogram

20:15.699 --> 20:17.366
On a man
in a delicate situation.

20:17.367 --> 20:18.834
- Delicate how?
Medically?

20:18.835 --> 20:20.836
- And politically.

20:20.837 --> 20:23.505
He's a dissident in hiding
from the government.

20:23.506 --> 20:24.873
- You didn't bring him here?

20:24.874 --> 20:26.707
- Not officially, I didn't.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.075
- No, hank.
Get him out.

20:28.076 --> 20:29.376
This is cuba.

20:29.377 --> 20:31.578
- Boris, I can't abandon
a patient; the tests--

20:31.579 --> 20:32.779
- If he's discovered here,
marisa will be seen

20:32.780 --> 20:33.847
As complicit.

20:33.848 --> 20:34.881
They could
shut this place down

20:34.882 --> 20:36.515
And have her arrested.

20:36.516 --> 20:38.651
If you need to care for him,
care for him elsewhere.

20:38.652 --> 20:40.852
- Like where?
- Like my home.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.587
- Okay, but he needs
an echo machine.

20:42.588 --> 20:43.955
- Well, then, take one.
Go out the back.

20:43.956 --> 20:46.357
And if anyone questions you,
direct them to me.

20:46.358 --> 20:48.158
- Thank you.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.226
From him and me.

20:49.227 --> 20:51.561
- All right.

20:51.562 --> 20:53.496
- When was the last time someone
took your core temperature--

20:53.497 --> 20:54.697
- Hank, they're taking
excellent care of me.

20:54.698 --> 20:56.665
Good-bye!
- Okay.

20:59.202 --> 21:01.169
- This way. Yep.

21:01.170 --> 21:02.871
Careful, careful.

21:02.872 --> 21:04.672
good.

21:04.673 --> 21:07.040
<i>-  Policia. Policia!</i>

21:08.576 --> 21:10.877
- Sorry, I need
to go back inside.

21:13.780 --> 21:15.047
- We can't stay here.

21:15.048 --> 21:17.015
- All right, uh,
go to the house

21:17.016 --> 21:18.383
Where you found me
this morning.

21:18.384 --> 21:20.185
I'll meet you there.
- There's something wrong?

21:20.186 --> 21:22.253
- I hope not.

21:27.124 --> 21:28.691
- Can I help you,
dr. Lawson?

21:28.692 --> 21:31.093
- Yeah, can I get a core
temperature on a patient

21:31.094 --> 21:32.261
In 104.

21:32.262 --> 21:33.228
- The crash team
is on its way.

21:33.229 --> 21:34.630
- Crash team?

21:34.631 --> 21:36.565
- Yes, a code blue
was called a minute ago.

22:07.313 --> 22:08.779
<i>- Gracias.</i>

22:16.420 --> 22:18.821
- Okay, boris.
It's okay.

22:18.822 --> 22:20.789
Okay.

22:27.728 --> 22:30.595
Careful.
Careful, easy.

22:30.596 --> 22:32.129
- What is this?

22:49.278 --> 22:50.445
- He's postictal
to a tonic-clonic seizure.

22:50.446 --> 22:52.047
Hypertensive, tachycardic,

22:52.048 --> 22:53.948
Tachypneic,
and hypothermic.

22:53.949 --> 22:55.116
- Dr. Velasquez
is in charge here.

22:55.117 --> 22:56.450
- No!

22:56.451 --> 22:58.019
Hank.

22:59.955 --> 23:01.455
- Is it an infection?

23:01.456 --> 23:03.691
- Could be gram-negative
sepsis--

23:03.692 --> 23:04.692
He's immunocompromised--

23:04.693 --> 23:06.694
Or graft versus host.

23:06.695 --> 23:08.296
Or he could be allergic
to your vector.

23:08.297 --> 23:10.065
At this moment,
it doesn't really matter.

23:12.034 --> 23:13.334
- What are you
treating him for?

23:13.335 --> 23:16.471
- Everything.

23:44.162 --> 23:45.764
- He's not stabilizing,
is he?

23:45.765 --> 23:48.366
- No...He's not.

23:50.402 --> 23:51.468
- No, no, give it a second.
It's an old machine.

23:51.469 --> 23:54.037
It will reboot itself.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.575
- That's what boris
needs to do.

23:59.576 --> 24:01.277
Reboot himself.

24:01.278 --> 24:03.181
Um...

24:03.182 --> 24:05.219
When you--when you
harvested stem cells,

24:05.220 --> 24:07.054
Did you retain
the leftover marrow?

24:07.055 --> 24:08.122
- I did.

24:08.123 --> 24:10.791
- Okay, if we reinfuse
that marrow,

24:10.792 --> 24:13.126
It's full of his own
t-cells, right?

24:13.127 --> 24:14.995
- So his system will mount
an immune response.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.729
- Uh-huh.
- You've seen that work before?

24:16.730 --> 24:17.930
- Well, we're running
out of science.

24:17.931 --> 24:19.631
At this point,
I'm counting on luck.

24:39.644 --> 24:40.744
- Oh!

24:49.221 --> 24:52.723
- Ah, you're trying
to bleed me, huh?

24:52.724 --> 24:54.858
Yeah, I understand.

24:54.859 --> 24:58.494
Well, it's sad,
you know.

24:58.495 --> 25:03.598
It's sad that I only have that
to play.

25:16.808 --> 25:19.510
- That means pass, right?

25:19.511 --> 25:20.678
- I think so.

25:20.679 --> 25:23.614
- Well...

25:23.615 --> 25:25.349
Oh, my god!

25:25.350 --> 25:26.916
- Oh, my god!

25:26.917 --> 25:28.918
Yes!

25:28.919 --> 25:30.253
- Wait, wait,
you got to translate

25:30.254 --> 25:31.255
For me for a second,
okay?

25:31.256 --> 25:34.325
Um, coolio...
- Julio.

25:34.326 --> 25:36.727
- I have not played this game
in a long time.

25:38.129 --> 25:40.596
- So this was very lucky
for me.

25:47.269 --> 25:48.535
Gracias.

25:55.109 --> 25:57.344
- Did you see his face,
like, drop?

25:57.345 --> 25:58.612
- He was like, uh, uh.

25:58.613 --> 25:59.946
- Yeah, he, like,
grew another chin.

25:59.947 --> 26:01.815
<i>Man, we blocked
his salida.</i>

26:01.816 --> 26:03.350
- I read your genius mind.

26:03.351 --> 26:04.518
Where did you learn
to play like that?

26:04.519 --> 26:05.518
- Where else?
Jersey.

26:05.519 --> 26:07.954
jersey.

26:07.955 --> 26:08.988
- This is for you.

26:08.989 --> 26:10.389
- What?
No.

26:10.390 --> 26:11.956
No, no, no, come on.
- I completely insist.

26:11.957 --> 26:13.825
This is a gift from me
to you, okay?

26:13.826 --> 26:15.960
Where I live,
I always have to scramble.

26:15.961 --> 26:17.962
I'm always on the lookout
for the next whale I can land.

26:17.963 --> 26:20.964
Watching you, I realized
that, you know, down here,

26:20.965 --> 26:23.400
I'm the whale, and you had
every right to hook me,

26:23.401 --> 26:25.635
So...
Right?

26:25.636 --> 26:26.969
- Just don't tell my sister.

26:26.970 --> 26:28.370
- Don't tell my brother,
and we're fine.

26:28.371 --> 26:30.138
- Okay.
- Great.

26:30.139 --> 26:33.275
And blow.

26:42.317 --> 26:45.485
- I take it
we had a setback.

26:45.486 --> 26:47.554
- Yeah, a slight hiccup.

26:48.989 --> 26:51.390
I have ruined
your data.

26:51.391 --> 26:53.892
- I was far more worried
about you.

26:53.893 --> 26:55.827
- No worries
with hank around.

26:55.828 --> 26:57.362
He has a hero complex.

26:57.363 --> 26:58.896
- It's not a complex.

26:58.897 --> 27:00.264
It's a neurosis.

27:28.525 --> 27:30.293
- So hank is awol
in a country

27:30.294 --> 27:32.728
Where we have
no diplomatic ties...

27:32.729 --> 27:34.530
- And, worse,
no cell phone reception.

27:34.531 --> 27:35.731
- Are you getting worried?

27:35.732 --> 27:38.667
- Only about my sanity.

27:38.668 --> 27:42.703
I can't take another day
with dr. Peck.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.405
And, for the record,

27:44.406 --> 27:46.940
You and I
just went three minutes

27:46.941 --> 27:48.708
Before returning
to the hank zone.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.542
- I'm sorry.

27:50.543 --> 27:53.378
We'll get better
with practice.

27:53.379 --> 27:54.712
And thank you
for coming tonight,

27:54.713 --> 27:55.746
Even though
it's not your scene.

27:55.747 --> 27:58.449
- You owe me
a concerto.

27:58.450 --> 27:59.616
And a real drink.

27:59.617 --> 28:02.152
- You drive a hard bargain,
divya.

28:02.153 --> 28:05.287
- "dibya"?
That's her name.

28:05.288 --> 28:08.323
- You again?
Really?

28:08.324 --> 28:10.691
- Once mcgillicuddy takes off,

28:10.692 --> 28:11.926
You and me can go back inside

28:11.927 --> 28:13.293
And get to know
each other better.

28:13.294 --> 28:15.228
- We're both leaving.
- Oh, come on.

28:15.229 --> 28:17.496
I got dibs on you,
dibya.

28:17.497 --> 28:19.965
- Yeah, okay, seriously,
leave her alone.

28:19.966 --> 28:22.033
- That's why you could never
hold on to a dude.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.336
Huh, mcgillicuddy?

28:24.337 --> 28:25.705
You are the dude.

28:25.706 --> 28:27.241
- Okay, now I'm gonna kick
your ass.

28:27.242 --> 28:29.110
- Baby, I'm a lover
not a fighter.

28:33.582 --> 28:35.583
- It's divya.

28:37.086 --> 28:39.254
- Jujitsu?
- Human anatomy.

28:39.255 --> 28:40.755
The kidney band
is particularly

28:40.756 --> 28:44.158
Vulnerable to impact.

28:44.159 --> 28:45.759
I guess stella mccartney
was the appropriate choice

28:45.760 --> 28:47.761
For the occasion.

28:47.762 --> 28:50.964
- Just so you know,
I totally had him,

28:50.965 --> 28:52.499
Bandyopadhyay.

28:52.500 --> 28:56.369
- Sure you did,
mcgillicuddy.

28:56.370 --> 28:59.873
- Drive safe.
- You too.

28:59.874 --> 29:05.478
- Good.

29:05.479 --> 29:07.613
I have some good news.

29:07.614 --> 29:09.714
- My heart is okay?

29:09.715 --> 29:11.612
- We caught the endocarditis
in time.

29:11.613 --> 29:13.679
<i>- Ay, gracias a dios.
- So he'll be fine?</i>

29:13.680 --> 29:15.513
- With a proper course
of iv antibiotics.

29:15.514 --> 29:17.847
I can get you started
right now.

29:17.848 --> 29:19.615
But you'll need
a six-week supply.

29:19.616 --> 29:22.284
Is there any pharmacy
that can help you out?

29:22.285 --> 29:24.653
- We'll make do.

29:24.654 --> 29:28.689
- Thank you
for everything, hank.

29:28.690 --> 29:30.859
- Uh, yeah,
can I talk to you?

29:30.860 --> 29:33.228
- Sure.
- We'll be right back.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.529
- Okay.

29:35.530 --> 29:37.364
- Why are you telling me this?

29:37.365 --> 29:38.664
- I can see that you're the
decision maker in your family.

29:38.665 --> 29:40.599
You need to know that,
without the right medicine--

29:40.600 --> 29:42.234
- Don't you have
some extra pills?

29:42.235 --> 29:44.202
- Oral antibiotics
won't do the job.

29:44.203 --> 29:46.571
- You think
everyone needs the best.

29:46.572 --> 29:49.974
- Yeah, while you get by
on almost nothing.

29:49.975 --> 29:55.244
- I guess...

29:55.245 --> 29:57.212
Opposites attract.

29:57.213 --> 30:02.016
- Look, what you're feeling
is gratitude.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.152
- No, it's not.

30:04.153 --> 30:07.489
Or it's not simply that.

30:07.490 --> 30:10.092
- Still, look,
it's not appropriate for me.

30:10.093 --> 30:11.527
As your uncle's doctor...

30:11.528 --> 30:13.029
- Doctor?

30:13.030 --> 30:16.166
You wouldn't even let me
call you doctor, hank.

30:17.668 --> 30:19.301
- Look, I'm leaving soon,
okay.

30:19.302 --> 30:21.236
I shouldn't have even been here
to start with.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.305
- I've lived my whole life

30:24.306 --> 30:27.741
With scarcity
and ration cards.

30:27.742 --> 30:31.077
In this country,
when something's on the shelf,

30:31.078 --> 30:32.611
You grab it.

30:36.782 --> 30:40.117
<i>- Socorro!</i>

30:44.889 --> 30:46.390
- Wait, wait, wait,
why are you here?

30:46.391 --> 30:47.857
Is boris okay?

30:47.858 --> 30:50.559
- He is fine,
but this, this is criminal.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.127
The paper said he was dead.

30:52.128 --> 30:54.729
- Oh, wait, so the cuban papers
got something wrong?

30:54.730 --> 30:56.130
- She's the doctor
you trust?

30:56.131 --> 30:57.598
- Let me explain
what's going on here.

30:57.599 --> 30:58.866
- No, no, no,
I can see it for myself.

30:58.867 --> 31:01.134
My hospital equipment
has been stolen

31:01.135 --> 31:03.203
And used to help
an enemy of the state.

31:03.204 --> 31:06.606
- Please, hank,
don't let her turn marcos in.

31:10.936 --> 31:12.069
- Dr. Casseras.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.738
- To think I came here
to thank you.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.572
- Look, this man--
- boris was just septic.

31:15.573 --> 31:17.506
You think he needs
this kind of trouble right now?

31:17.507 --> 31:19.008
- Boris is the one who told me
to bring them here.

31:19.009 --> 31:20.776
- No. He isn't that careless.

31:20.777 --> 31:23.011
- Sometimes people take risks
they normally wouldn't

31:23.012 --> 31:24.279
To protect someone
they care about.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.680
- He wouldn't risk
everything he has here

31:25.681 --> 31:26.680
To protect that man.

31:26.681 --> 31:27.981
- He didn't.

31:27.982 --> 31:30.817
He risked everything he has here
to protect you.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.457
- What is wrong with him?

31:39.458 --> 31:40.992
- He's--he's in love.

31:40.993 --> 31:42.127
<i>- No, hombre,
with your patient.</i>

31:42.128 --> 31:43.929
Marcos machado.
What is wrong with him?

31:43.930 --> 31:45.131
- Endocarditis.

31:45.132 --> 31:46.165
No valve damage,

31:46.166 --> 31:47.932
But he needs six weeks
of cefazolin

31:47.933 --> 31:49.434
And gentamicin.

31:49.435 --> 31:50.601
- And he won't go
to a hospital.

31:50.602 --> 31:52.104
- He won't even go
to a pharmacy.

31:52.105 --> 31:53.405
- No, of course not.

31:53.406 --> 31:54.640
He has to stay in hiding.

31:54.641 --> 31:56.609
- Mm-hmm.

31:56.610 --> 32:00.112
- If I get you
the drugs,

32:00.113 --> 32:01.313
He can self-administer?

32:01.314 --> 32:04.149
- Yeah, I could put in
a picc line.

32:04.150 --> 32:07.150
- Okay.

32:07.151 --> 32:09.952
- Okay.

32:09.953 --> 32:12.121
- Then do it.

32:12.122 --> 32:13.622
- All right.

32:13.623 --> 32:15.157
Thank you.

32:26.833 --> 32:29.034
- Oh, thank you.

32:29.035 --> 32:31.302
- Isn't your chicken
supposed to come with penne?

32:31.303 --> 32:32.969
- It did.
It's right here.

32:32.970 --> 32:34.304
- No, that's ziti.

32:34.305 --> 32:37.074
Penne's cut on the diagonal.
It holds more sauce.

32:37.075 --> 32:39.543
I spent my junior year
in florence.

32:39.544 --> 32:41.210
- Did you study art

32:41.211 --> 32:42.577
Or just pasta shapes?

32:42.578 --> 32:45.512
- I know you find me difficult,

32:45.513 --> 32:48.079
Abrasive,
a bitch maybe.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.379
But if that's how I'm perceived
holding myself and others

32:50.380 --> 32:52.548
Up to a higher standard,
then fine.

32:52.549 --> 32:54.649
Standards are important.

32:54.650 --> 32:56.384
Order is important.

32:56.385 --> 32:58.719
Even an order of pasta.

33:01.857 --> 33:05.359
- Believe it or not,
I agree with you.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.493
Not so much about the pasta,

33:07.494 --> 33:08.895
But the rest of it anyway.

33:08.896 --> 33:12.432
- Well, maybe that explains
the tension between us.

33:12.433 --> 33:14.068
We're not so different
after all.

33:14.069 --> 33:16.570
- Oh, god.
Someone help!

33:16.571 --> 33:18.172
I need a doctor!

33:24.345 --> 33:26.213
- What's going on?
- He got a noodle

33:26.214 --> 33:27.614
Stuck up his nose,
and he can't get it out.

33:27.615 --> 33:29.282
- I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

33:29.283 --> 33:31.851
- You are breathing.
It's gonna be all right, okay?

33:31.852 --> 33:36.387
Come here. I'm gonna put my
finger on the side of your nose.

33:36.388 --> 33:37.788
Then I'm gonna give you
a little kiss.

33:37.789 --> 33:41.291
And then the noodle's
gonna come out. Okay?

33:43.294 --> 33:45.595
Ah.

33:45.596 --> 33:48.030
- I see you had the penne.

33:48.031 --> 33:49.698
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

33:49.699 --> 33:53.201
- Let me give you something, uh,
for your dry cleaning at least.

33:53.202 --> 33:55.770
- No worries.
Occupational hazard.

33:55.771 --> 33:59.872
You, young man,
are a good kisser.

33:59.873 --> 34:01.274
Keep the noodles
out of your nose,

34:01.275 --> 34:05.643
And, one of these days,
you're gonna break some hearts.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.347
- Other than the mess,
you did pretty well.

34:10.348 --> 34:11.447
Though I would have given em
a business card.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.550
- You didn't move a muscle.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.150
- And you broke
through the sound barrier.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.252
- They called
for a doctor.

34:16.253 --> 34:18.054
- It wasn't life-threatening,

34:18.054 --> 34:20.054
And I kept my eye on you.

34:20.056 --> 34:22.791
You get to save the day,
I observe my three-second rule,

34:22.792 --> 34:24.292
Everybody goes home
a winner.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.226
- The three-second rule?

34:26.226 --> 34:27.726
- When someone calls
for a doctor,

34:27.728 --> 34:29.495
You count for three seconds.

34:29.496 --> 34:31.230
If nobody gets up,
then you go in.

34:31.231 --> 34:33.063
Why expose yourself
to a lawsuit

34:33.065 --> 34:34.565
Unless absolutely necessary?

34:34.567 --> 34:36.534
- Because when I see someone
in need,

34:36.534 --> 34:39.235
I think medically,
not legally.

34:39.237 --> 34:42.472
About yesterday,
you were wrong.

34:42.473 --> 34:47.476
I'm not one of those women
who don't like other women.

34:47.476 --> 34:50.411
I'm one of those women
who doesn't like you.

34:58.956 --> 35:01.657
<i>- Gracias, amigo.</i>

35:01.658 --> 35:04.293
- Oh, my god.
Oh, yeah.

35:04.294 --> 35:06.328
Now that's
what I'm talking about.

35:06.329 --> 35:08.663
Thank you. It's the perfect
thing to remind me of cuba.

35:08.664 --> 35:11.432
- It's dominican.
- Of course it is.

35:11.433 --> 35:12.866
- So, member,
three times a day

35:12.867 --> 35:14.168
For six weeks.

35:14.169 --> 35:15.936
I know it's a pain,
but don't skip any.

35:15.937 --> 35:17.371
- Sure. Sure.
- Don't worry, doc.

35:17.372 --> 35:18.839
I'll help him.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.340
- Yeah, like he helped me
with the engine bolt.

35:23.777 --> 35:26.212
- How would I say

35:26.213 --> 35:30.183
"dominicans are the new cubans"
in spanish?

35:30.184 --> 35:31.584
- So marcos should be fine.

35:31.585 --> 35:32.852
He should get another echo

35:32.853 --> 35:34.787
To make sure
there's no recurrence.

35:34.788 --> 35:37.556
If he can ever, you know,
come back to life.

35:37.557 --> 35:41.226
- A lot would have to change
for that day to come.

35:41.227 --> 35:43.528
- Well, I hope it does.

35:43.529 --> 35:46.565
You know,
then cuba wouldn't seem so...

35:46.566 --> 35:47.566
Far away.

35:47.567 --> 35:49.801
- Yeah.
Well, for now,

35:49.802 --> 35:51.903
We take what we can get.

36:14.225 --> 36:17.394
I'll miss you.
- Bye-bye.

36:17.395 --> 36:19.830
- Push me.
Push, push, push.

36:19.831 --> 36:22.065
- She wants us to push.
All right.

36:22.066 --> 36:25.435
- Please.
- All right, all right.

36:43.892 --> 36:46.361
- I'm looking forward
to continue our dialogue.

36:46.362 --> 36:48.097
- Same here.

36:48.098 --> 36:50.900
You still made more progress
with this disease

36:50.901 --> 36:53.703
Than any of the doctors
I've found so far.

36:53.704 --> 36:55.204
And if you're ever
in the states, come visit.

36:55.205 --> 36:57.073
We'll steal a dialysis machine
or something.

36:57.074 --> 37:00.009
thank you, dr. Lawson.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.077
And have a safe trip home.

37:01.078 --> 37:03.412
- Thank you.

37:15.424 --> 37:18.426
- Good.

37:18.427 --> 37:19.761
131 over 80.

37:19.762 --> 37:21.529
You stabilized quickly.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.830
Flying out
shouldn't be a problem.

37:22.831 --> 37:24.732
So I can clear you
to leave.

37:24.733 --> 37:28.970
- You clear me
to stay, hank?

37:28.971 --> 37:30.839
For a while,
perhaps?

37:30.840 --> 37:33.175
- I guess that depends
on the reason.

37:35.145 --> 37:36.779
- It's not medical.

37:40.083 --> 37:43.185
- Then yeah.
Yeah, I think I can clear that.

37:57.665 --> 37:59.666
Evan!

37:59.667 --> 38:01.834
All right, come on.
We're done. Let's go.

38:08.508 --> 38:09.542
- To cuba.

38:09.543 --> 38:11.477
To canadians.

38:11.478 --> 38:13.779
To private jets.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.547
- To dominoes.
- Yes, to dominoes.

38:15.548 --> 38:19.251
Indeed.

38:19.252 --> 38:21.820
- Sounds like cubans play
a wild game.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.822
- Mom wouldn't
even recognize it.

38:23.823 --> 38:27.126
Like, it's crazy.

38:27.127 --> 38:29.628
- I was jealous of you,

38:29.629 --> 38:31.497
Spending so much time
with her.

38:31.498 --> 38:33.632
- Jealous?

38:33.633 --> 38:35.233
- Yeah,
you could make her laugh.

38:35.234 --> 38:37.469
You know?

38:37.470 --> 38:38.670
Even at the end.

38:38.671 --> 38:40.071
- That's all I did,
though.

38:40.072 --> 38:41.706
You were holding the family
together.

38:41.707 --> 38:44.843
- You had the harder job.

38:44.844 --> 38:47.245
I couldn't do it.

38:47.246 --> 38:49.848
So thanks.

38:49.849 --> 38:53.285
I should have said that before.

38:53.286 --> 38:55.287
Thank you.

38:59.958 --> 39:01.893
- We should really travel
together more often.

39:01.894 --> 39:05.062
- Yeah.

39:05.063 --> 39:09.600
- Gentlemen,
may I offer you cigars?

39:09.601 --> 39:11.369
- Are they really cuban?

39:11.370 --> 39:13.571
- They belong to boris.

39:13.572 --> 39:16.808
- Not anymore,
they don't.

39:16.809 --> 39:19.377
- Okay.

39:19.378 --> 39:22.380
You can't keep those.

39:29.151 --> 39:31.853
- I had to reschedule
all non-emergent retainers.

39:31.854 --> 39:33.388
That means a heavy week,

39:33.389 --> 39:34.956
But I am confident

39:34.957 --> 39:37.457
That we can handle
the extra hours

39:37.458 --> 39:39.893
Now that we have all hands
back on deck.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.694
- The lady said hands,
not feet.

39:41.695 --> 39:43.562
- Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

39:43.563 --> 39:45.464
Sorry, I was focused
on my cigar.

39:45.465 --> 39:47.733
- Nice draw
on this bad boy, huh?

39:47.734 --> 39:49.267
- Are you getting
the malty finish?

39:49.268 --> 39:51.769
- You gentlemen aren't keen
to address the schedule I see.

39:51.770 --> 39:53.938
<i>- Mañana, divya,
mañana.</i>

39:53.939 --> 39:55.639
Fire up that little number.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.674
Embrace the life you have.

39:58.809 --> 40:00.843
- I am embracing a return

40:00.844 --> 40:02.178
To business as usual.

40:02.179 --> 40:03.679
I missed you guys.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.716
I even missed staff meetings.

40:07.717 --> 40:09.017
- Whoa.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.423
- Not bad.

40:16.424 --> 40:19.226
- Right?
Montecristos.

40:19.227 --> 40:22.195
Almost salty.
Very tasty.

40:22.196 --> 40:26.031
I'm thinking next time we get
kidnapped to a tropical island,

40:26.032 --> 40:27.900
And then we get kidnapped
on that tropical island,

40:27.901 --> 40:29.035
That we bring this one along.

40:29.036 --> 40:30.737
- Yeah.
- This one?

40:30.738 --> 40:33.840
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

40:33.841 --> 40:35.108
- Dr. Peck.

40:35.109 --> 40:36.843
- Hi.

40:36.844 --> 40:39.345
- Uh, this is evan lawson.

40:39.346 --> 40:41.181
- Hi, evan r. Lawson.

40:41.182 --> 40:43.049
- Cfo of hankmed.
- Yeah.

40:43.050 --> 40:45.017
- The financial mastermind
of the operation.

40:45.018 --> 40:46.752
- Huh.
- And this is doctor...

40:46.753 --> 40:48.520
- Hank lawson.
Yes, we've met.

40:48.521 --> 40:49.988
- Yeah, we have.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.224
You're the dr. Peck
who made me dispensable.

40:53.559 --> 40:54.860
Divya was a huge help.

40:54.861 --> 40:58.063
- So what are you doing here?

40:58.064 --> 40:59.397
Did you forget something?

40:59.398 --> 41:01.032
- No, I'm just dropping off
my notes.

41:01.033 --> 41:02.734
Divya mentioned that you like
to write your own up.

41:02.735 --> 41:03.902
And I must say
I found it very useful.

41:03.903 --> 41:05.436
- Oh, good.
Good.

41:05.437 --> 41:08.606
- Well, you didn't need
to make a special visit.

41:08.607 --> 41:11.176
- Well, we were just wrapping up
our staff meeting.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.711
If you would care to join us
in the smoking section.

41:13.712 --> 41:14.946
- Yeah.
- Is this a meeting of the staff

41:14.947 --> 41:16.881
Or a meeting
of the five families?

41:17.883 --> 41:19.584
Actually, I really wanted

41:19.585 --> 41:20.985
To thank you
for the opportunity.

41:20.986 --> 41:22.854
- Oh, no, no, no.
Boris is the one to thank.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.422
- He is, actually.

41:24.423 --> 41:25.923
- No, we should be thanking you

41:25.924 --> 41:28.259
For being such a good ambassador
for the hankmed brand.

41:28.260 --> 41:29.327
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:29.328 --> 41:31.462
- And a valuable brand it is.

41:31.463 --> 41:33.330
The whole weekend
was very educational.

41:33.331 --> 41:36.466
- Sure was.
- It was nice to meet you.

41:36.467 --> 41:38.002
- Oh, my pleasure.

41:38.003 --> 41:40.271
- And to see you.
- Yeah, nice to see you too.

41:40.272 --> 41:42.306
- You know what, why don't
you leave us your number?

41:42.307 --> 41:43.607
That way
if we get abducted again,

41:43.608 --> 41:44.608
We can give you a call.

41:44.609 --> 41:45.609
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

41:45.610 --> 41:47.011
- I actually have it.

41:47.012 --> 41:48.679
- No, it's a new number.
It's local.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.180
I got it this morning,

41:50.181 --> 41:52.116
So I'll text it to you.

41:52.117 --> 41:53.750
- A local number?

41:53.751 --> 41:55.685
Are you sticking around?

41:55.686 --> 41:59.855
