01:05.834 --> 01:08.291
So here's the rub--
it was Oedipus' faults

01:08.291 --> 01:11.166
that ultimately led
to his downfall, okay?

01:11.166 --> 01:14.125
But was it his flaws
or was it fate that was
to blame?

01:14.125 --> 01:16.959
Well, Sophocles made
the prophecy unconditional,

01:16.959 --> 01:18.166
so it had to happen.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.917
It didn't matter
what Oedipus did.

01:19.917 --> 01:23.417
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding,
you are correct, Cleo.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.166
And that is why
you're my favorite.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.166
Well, that's not fair.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.041
I'm a sub.
It doesn't matter.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.542
I haven't read this book
in, like, 20 years.

01:30.542 --> 01:32.166
I'm just saying
what I remember,

01:32.166 --> 01:33.834
which apparently
is quite a bit.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.291
So here's
the biggest question.

01:35.291 --> 01:39.000
The fact is, Oedipus couldn't
have done anything differently.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.375
He was screwed
from the moment
he was born.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.000
But he still had
free will,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.333
so he had the free will
to make positive choices.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.250
So this begs the question--
are we just doing good things

01:48.250 --> 01:49.667
to avoid
personal suffering,

01:49.667 --> 01:51.583
or is there actually
such a thing as goodness?

01:51.583 --> 01:55.000
Well, what's he gonna do,
ask every woman he sleeps with
if they're his mom?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.542
- ( scattered laughter )
- That's a great point.

01:56.542 --> 01:59.166
It kind of kills the mood.
I think a good rule of thumb
for adopted kids

01:59.166 --> 02:00.667
should be, like,
to go for another race.

02:00.667 --> 02:01.917
Why risk it, you know?

02:01.917 --> 02:05.458
Simon, you're the funniest
person I've ever met.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.708
You should write for "SNL."

02:06.708 --> 02:08.291
Here's the thing
that's interesting.

02:08.291 --> 02:09.542
If we want
to take Oedipus

02:09.542 --> 02:11.041
and bring it into
our current moment,

02:11.041 --> 02:14.375
this is basically
where the whole concept
of the MILF comes from.

02:14.375 --> 02:18.375
( bell rings )

02:18.375 --> 02:20.208
'Sup?

02:27.375 --> 02:30.208
So this is
a teachers' lounge.

02:30.208 --> 02:34.083
Behold.
That's why we are
teachers and lounging.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.166
Oh, cool.
Hey, I'm Hannah.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.542
I shouldn't.
I'm covered in glue.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.583
'Cause I'm guessing
you teach art.

02:40.583 --> 02:43.208
Uh, history.
Yeah, it's a long story.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.542
Oh, got it.

02:44.542 --> 02:46.041
You're the new sub,
right?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.917
I am.
It's my first week.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.667
Yeah, I'm Fran.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.083
Your juice box says Joe,

02:51.083 --> 02:52.875
so I'm not sure
what to believe.

02:52.875 --> 02:55.917
Yeah, well,
Joe and I have
a little arrangement.

02:55.917 --> 02:58.792
He brings me a juice box
and I don't fail his
older sister.

02:58.792 --> 03:01.917
- That's really good.
- It's great all
the way around.

03:01.917 --> 03:05.166
- What do you teach?
- This semester, it is
17th century

03:05.166 --> 03:06.667
European notions
of utopia.

03:06.667 --> 03:09.083
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, it's just normal
high school stuff.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.834
- Perfect.
- You know? Yeah.

03:10.834 --> 03:15.291
So, should we get
some drinks tonight
or what?

03:17.792 --> 03:21.250
Um, yeah.
That'd be awesome.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.542
( music playing )

03:27.083 --> 03:28.917
I just think maybe
this is the reason

03:28.917 --> 03:31.166
that Adam and I broke up
in the first place,

03:31.166 --> 03:33.417
is so that Fran and I
could get married.

03:33.417 --> 03:36.875
( snorts )
That's something a "Bachelor"
contestant would say.

03:36.875 --> 03:40.291
I mean, we had
the most incredible,
immediate connection.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.625
There was so much going--
it's like we're both academics,

03:42.625 --> 03:44.917
he loves his sister.

03:44.917 --> 03:46.083
What do you think?

03:46.083 --> 03:49.125
Just, like, casual,
with, like, a huarache sandal.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.208
What the fuck?

03:52.208 --> 03:54.041
I mean, if you want him
to think you killed your kids

03:54.041 --> 03:57.417
and have been living
in the Florida Panhandle,
knock yourself out.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.083
Okay, I'm sorry.
This shirt works.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.291
Elijah:
Does it?

04:00.291 --> 04:03.291
It's just so crazy.
It's like I'm going
on a date.

04:03.291 --> 04:05.458
Can you believe that?
It's like who even
goes on a date?

04:05.458 --> 04:06.583
It's like I'm fucking 45.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.291
A 45-year-old
who just got out
of a bad divorce.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.667
My pilates teacher
inspired me to take a chance.

04:12.667 --> 04:15.291
Sure, I'm scared,
but I gotta take a chance.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.708
I don't want to die alone,
not without a fight.

04:17.708 --> 04:19.834
I'm still a sexual,
viable woman.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.834
Now get out of here
'cause I have to masturbate.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.667
- That's what you do
before a date.
- Ugh!

04:24.667 --> 04:26.667
So the sexual tension
doesn't, like, overwhelm
the evening.

04:26.667 --> 04:30.000
- So you can think.
- You're so loud
when you do it.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.625
I'll do it, too.

04:34.625 --> 04:38.000
( music playing )

04:40.583 --> 04:42.667
I guess I kind of
always saw myself
more at, like,

04:42.667 --> 04:44.917
a-- an inner-city
public school type thing.

04:44.917 --> 04:49.542
Like, deep in the Bronx,
you know, teaching the kids
who can't be taught,

04:49.542 --> 04:52.166
like Annie Potts
in the "Dangerous Minds"
TV show.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.291
- Ooh.
- But it turns out you need
a teaching degree for that.

04:55.291 --> 04:59.834
Yeah, well, you definitely
do not need a degree to teach
at St. Justine's.

04:59.834 --> 05:02.959
- That's--
that's a hard fact.
- It appears not.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.208
- Yeah, do you know
Mr. Parsons, chemistry?
- Yes.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.125
He dropped out
of middle school.

05:07.125 --> 05:10.500
- Are you kidding me?
- He was like, "How far
did you get in schooling?"

05:10.500 --> 05:11.875
I was like,
"Through college."

05:11.875 --> 05:13.583
And he was like,
"Huh, sixth grade."

05:13.583 --> 05:15.834
Wow, I didn't even need
to do half of what I did.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.333
Look, I'm jealous
of these kids.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.750
I didn't get to take,
you know, origami expression

05:19.750 --> 05:21.041
when I was in high school.

05:21.041 --> 05:22.041
I took gym.

05:22.041 --> 05:24.750
The entire arts department
at my high school

05:24.750 --> 05:26.125
consisted
of a broken trumpet

05:26.125 --> 05:29.125
and a music teacher
who'd been fired for
acting in a porno.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.750
No way.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.834
Well, he was just jerking off.
He wasn't, like, the star.

05:32.834 --> 05:36.250
But he-- but he was there.
He was on the periphery.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.041
Was he good?

05:38.041 --> 05:40.875
I mean, he ejaculated?

05:40.875 --> 05:42.875
- I don't know.
He was fine.
- ( laughs )

05:42.875 --> 05:44.542
He was fine.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.125
I'm having
a really nice time.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.250
- Yeah.
- Thank you
for inviting me.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.917
Uh, should we get
another drink?

05:50.917 --> 05:54.583
I was actually gonna ask
if you wanted to maybe
check out this art show

05:54.583 --> 05:57.792
that I'm sure is gonna
be absolutely terrible.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.583
I just sold it
really well.

05:59.583 --> 06:00.750
I absolutely would.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.417
- Perfect.
- Cool.

06:02.417 --> 06:03.583
Done and done.
Cheers.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.000
Cheers.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.208
Been loading them cables
all damn day.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.792
Back then we used to call it
the East River Bridge.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.917
"Fit to be good
for jumping," we'd say.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.208
Poor bastard died
of an infection.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.625
I asked Steph
to meet me at the mall.

06:17.625 --> 06:23.458
She texted me back.
"L-O-L, I don't hang
with sluts."

06:23.458 --> 06:27.250
I was like,
"What did Jaden say?"

06:27.250 --> 06:29.959
What did Jaden say?

06:29.959 --> 06:32.959
Oh, okay, so now
you're-- you're Amber.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.208
Okay, great.
Sorry.

06:34.208 --> 06:37.208
By this point,
it was all over Facebook.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.875
"Amber sucks
baseball dick."

06:39.875 --> 06:41.375
( snorts )
Stop.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.125
That is brilliant,
though.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.542
I mean,
it was offensive,
I'm sure,

06:45.542 --> 06:47.750
but you have to admit,
it was pretty clever.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.959
Then-- so what
did you say?

06:49.959 --> 06:52.959
( whispers )
Well, I'm not supposed
to go off-script.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.750
What do you mean script?

06:54.750 --> 06:57.166
( flatly )
Kindly put these on.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.000
Oh, thank you very much.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.500
- Okay.
- Love that enthusiasm.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.417
Well, I knew
this would suck,

07:03.417 --> 07:05.834
but I did not have
any idea just how much.

07:05.834 --> 07:09.000
Are you kidding?
This is terribly wonderful.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.417
Well, you are
a delightful sport.

07:10.417 --> 07:12.500
- Thank you.
- Shall we?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.333
( woman, flatly )
Kindly put these on.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.834
"Ask me my name"?

07:15.834 --> 07:18.625
- What's your name?
- Dorkis.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.750
Dorkis.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.417
- With an X?
- S.

07:21.417 --> 07:26.000
- What's your name?
- Uh, Johan, but with
a Y and a J.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.333
- Woman: Excuse me.
- Hello.

07:28.333 --> 07:31.542
Hannah?
What are you doing here?

07:31.542 --> 07:34.500
Oh, um, hello,
Marnie, Desi.
This is Fran.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.959
Hey, nice to meet you.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.500
Seriously, it's kind of
crazy that you're here,
don't you think?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.834
How come?
What's-- what's going on?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.708
I mean, if you're
talking about Adam,

07:41.708 --> 07:43.500
he and I are
completely fine

07:43.500 --> 07:44.917
and we're just
checking out the show.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.542
I think it's beautiful
that you're here

07:46.542 --> 07:50.542
and not contributing
to this pervasive,
toxic culture

07:50.542 --> 07:54.542
of women in the arts
just cutting each other down,
maligning each other.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.208
I love the way you think.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.041
- Seriously.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Hannah.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.875
So, just putting
a couple things together.

08:01.875 --> 08:04.708
Uh, your ex-boyfriend
is here?

08:04.708 --> 08:06.542
Yeah, you know, I probably
should've told you about it,

08:06.542 --> 08:08.917
but on the other hand,
it's like we broke up
so long ago

08:08.917 --> 08:10.917
and the wounds
are so healed.

08:10.917 --> 08:13.166
And at this point
it's like we're all just part
of one big friend group.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.041
- Really?
- Fran: You know what?
It's no problem.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.458
You know?
Everybody's got a past.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.875
This might be shocking
for some folks,

08:18.875 --> 08:21.750
but I have dated
people before.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.875
- Women, in fact.
- ( laughs )

08:25.250 --> 08:26.917
Hello.
What the hell?

08:26.917 --> 08:28.708
- Ahem.
- Uh, excuse me?

08:28.708 --> 08:31.417
I was six years old
when they took me away.
My mom was crying.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.917
- They were gonna
put her in another camp.
- We've heard this one, Desi.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.041
What's happening?

08:35.041 --> 08:36.041
She tried to give
the soldier

08:36.041 --> 08:37.833
my favorite doll,
a family heirloom.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.625
The soldier threw it
on the ground.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.582
Its porcelain head
cracked.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.834
Uh, this way, please?

08:44.834 --> 08:47.291
- Uh, yeah, we can
talk for a minute.
- Wow.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.708
But Fran can hear
anything you have to say.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.583
What are you doing here?

08:51.583 --> 08:52.667
Okay, we're on a date.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.625
We were looking for
a cultural activity to do

08:54.625 --> 08:56.083
like the two cultured
New Yorkers we are,

08:56.083 --> 08:59.625
and so we find ourselves here
at Mimi-Rose Howard's show.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.083
Hannah.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.583
It's our first date.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.834
Hannah, would you do me
a favor and leave

09:03.834 --> 09:05.708
before this gets
really fucking weird?

09:05.708 --> 09:08.458
You mean like
10 minutes ago?
( laughs )

09:08.458 --> 09:09.667
You know what?
Maybe we should go.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.834
You know what, Fran?
I don't want to go

09:10.834 --> 09:12.375
because I feel like
we haven't really experienced

09:12.375 --> 09:15.291
the wonder
of this experience yet.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.500
You can't be serious
with this.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
- We oughta--
- I'm not doing anything, okay?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.125
I'm over it.
You're not over it.

09:20.125 --> 09:23.625
Otherwise you wouldn't
have noticed me in this crowd
of 40 to 70 people.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.625
( sighs )
Starting to feel
a little used here.

09:25.625 --> 09:26.959
You didn't come here
to see the show.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.125
No, I came here to see
my friend Marnie,

09:29.125 --> 09:32.959
my other friend Jessa,
and for a date that I'm on
with a man named Fran.

09:32.959 --> 09:33.959
Check him out.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.792
All right.
I am out.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.542
This is a huge
fucking city.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.166
- How hard is it for us
to avoid each other...
- Fran!

09:39.166 --> 09:40.500
...until you get over this?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.291
Adam, I am
over this, okay?

09:42.291 --> 09:45.708
What am I supposed to do,
call ahead to every place
you might possibly be?

09:45.708 --> 09:48.000
It's my girlfriend's art show.
I'm gonna be here.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.125
I'm not gonna
be anywhere else.

09:49.125 --> 09:52.333
You can hang out
with your friends
everywhere else.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.208
Why are you really here?

09:54.208 --> 09:56.208
I don't know.

09:56.208 --> 09:59.250
Hannah, you came.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.542
I did, Mimi-Rose.
I came and I really
enjoyed myself.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.333
And now I think
I'm gonna have
to leave.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.458
Oh, okay.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.834
Well, thank you
for coming.

10:07.834 --> 10:10.875
Thank you, and thank you
for this artistry.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.000
Thank you, Hannah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.542
We're actually about
to go to the after-party,

10:13.542 --> 10:14.500
if you'd like to join us.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.750
No, I don't think
that's necessary.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.041
No, it's not
that big of a deal.

10:17.041 --> 10:18.625
My ex-partner Ace
is going.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.291
Her ex-partner Ace
is coming.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.000
Hannah, would you like
to share a car with us?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.500
- Well, Hannah's on a date.
- I'm not on a date anymore.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
Adam intimidated him
and he fled,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.125
so, yeah,
I'd love to come.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.708
Holy donkey shit.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.708
Mims, you ready to go?
Hi, I'm Ace.

10:31.708 --> 10:33.667
- Oh, Hannah.
- Mimi's former partner.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.875
Oh, my God, I'm Hannah,
Adam's former partner.

10:35.875 --> 10:40.208
- Ace.
- Yeah, okay.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.792
Shall we into the night?

10:41.792 --> 10:43.875
Shall we do this thang?

10:43.875 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.
After you.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.875
After you.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.542
- After you.
- I said after you.

10:50.542 --> 10:52.625
- Okay, I'll go.
- Okay, great, I'll go.

10:52.625 --> 10:56.417
Oh, and you can
take these off now.

10:56.417 --> 10:57.542
No way.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.125
Let's keep
this experience
alive all night.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.542
I'm gonna wear mine
till the morning time

11:01.542 --> 11:03.000
and then pretend
I work at Home Depot
all day,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.583
- helping people and shit.
- ( groans )

11:04.583 --> 11:06.542
I don't even like
what I chose to
wear tonight,

11:06.542 --> 11:09.083
so this is actually
a great solution for me.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.750
Oh, crap, a cab!
I'm gonna grab it!

11:10.750 --> 11:12.875
Mimi-Rose:
Ace, there's a cab
right here.

11:12.875 --> 11:14.000
Ace!

11:14.000 --> 11:17.417
All right. Oh, Adam,
why don't you ride with Ace

11:17.417 --> 11:19.250
and Hannah
can ride with me?

11:19.250 --> 11:20.542
The four of us can fit
all in one car.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.917
- Ace!
- No, Adam,
go ride with him.

11:22.917 --> 11:25.708
- Why?
- 'Cause I want you to get
to know each other.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.041
Our past relationships
are part of who we are.

11:28.041 --> 11:30.583
Ace is a big part
of my life.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.750
Big part of her life.

11:34.375 --> 11:37.041
Super.
I'll share a car with Ace

11:37.041 --> 11:39.125
and you two
will share this car

11:39.125 --> 11:41.417
and we'll all meet
over at the place.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.875
Sounds like a great plan.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.750
- Motherfucker.
- Ace: Adam!

11:52.750 --> 11:56.959
Let's NYC taxi it
to the party, bro!

11:56.959 --> 12:00.333
( music playing on radio )

12:01.792 --> 12:03.875
Is your name Adeem?

12:03.875 --> 12:05.208
Yeah.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.792
That's a beautiful name.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.417
Thank you.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.166
This is a cool idea.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.125
( Ace laughing )
I'm sorry, man.

12:17.125 --> 12:20.000
It's pretty classic
Mimi-Rose.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.291
You know,
what we find awkward,
she finds blissful.

12:22.291 --> 12:26.583
Your suffering's
her fucking safe space.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.166
Wait, what?

12:29.166 --> 12:31.250
What, you mean you're not
clued into the whole act?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.291
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.750
Her whole thing, man.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.583
Pretending she's some
sweet weirdo girl from Maine

12:38.583 --> 12:40.917
with the bitten-up lips
and the Asperger's.

12:40.917 --> 12:42.834
Come on, man.
Eventually, you have
to recognize

12:42.834 --> 12:44.834
it's hollow,
it's curated.

12:44.834 --> 12:47.875
She's a bad, bad girl
who knows what works.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.792
Should we just
take some selfies
and get really weird?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.708
Why do you keep
coming to her stuff
and supporting her, then,

12:51.708 --> 12:53.875
if you think
she's so manipulative?

12:53.875 --> 12:56.834
Uh, because I will always
be in love with her.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.000
Okay, fuck this.
We live together.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.458
Enjoy it while it lasts
'cause I'm gonna get her back,
motherfucker.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.792
No, this is
fucking bullshit.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.291
You think she really
likes you, monkey face?

13:04.291 --> 13:05.291
You're just
a chess move, buddy.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.083
You motherfucker.
Just pull over!

13:07.083 --> 13:09.500
All right, buddy.
Hey. Chill.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.083
I would never, ever
call you a mother effer
for serious.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.125
It's not my game.
You know what I mean?

13:14.125 --> 13:17.041
It's not my jam,
it's not who I am.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.417
I know where you are
right now.

13:19.417 --> 13:22.250
Adrift in the river
of Mimi-Rose.

13:25.542 --> 13:28.708
I get the feeling
that you didn't really
like my show.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.208
Well, that's crazy
'cause I fuckin' loved
your show.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.959
You know you can
be honest with me.

13:33.959 --> 13:36.583
I find criticism
to be super valuable.

13:36.583 --> 13:41.333
And I can't criticize you
when I have absolutely
nothing to criticize.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.875
I mean, the show was perfect.
It was Beyoncé to me.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.959
Okay.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.417
Glad you found it
to be affecting.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.375
I did.
I was very affected.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.875
I didn't really have
as much time to work on it
as I would've liked

13:54.875 --> 13:57.583
'cause I got sucked into
writing this stupid book.

13:57.583 --> 14:01.250
- You're, uh,
writing a book?
- I'm trying.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.959
It's a psychosexual
thriller

14:02.959 --> 14:05.000
told from the perspective
of a dead woman

14:05.000 --> 14:06.083
who solves
her own murder

14:06.083 --> 14:09.250
using hologram technology
that she invented.

14:09.250 --> 14:14.083
I think it'll probably suck,
but I just always try to work
outside my comfort zone

14:14.083 --> 14:15.250
'cause that's
the only way you grow,

14:15.250 --> 14:17.542
but I'm not
a real writer like you.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.625
I'm not a writer at all.
I mean, not anymore.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.250
That's not
what Adam says.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.500
I quit, and I've literally
never been happier.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.750
Your finger's
touching my shoulder.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.250
Hey, um, could we make
the turn up here?

14:29.250 --> 14:31.250
That would be great.
We need to try
a different route.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.917
Great.
Great idea.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.458
- ( brakes squeal )
- ( Hannah and Mimi-Rose
scream )

14:40.083 --> 14:42.291
Are you okay?

14:42.291 --> 14:44.000
I-- I think I'm--

14:44.000 --> 14:45.667
What's your name?

14:46.417 --> 14:48.500
- Mary.
- Mary, okay.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.959
Hey! Come here.
Can we get some help?

14:50.959 --> 14:53.375
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- His name's Adeem.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.917
Hannah:
Adeem, I'm so sorry
I asked you to turn.

14:55.917 --> 14:57.792
It's your fault.
It's her fault.

14:57.792 --> 14:58.959
Well, it's not my fault.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.417
Miss, are you
all right?

15:00.417 --> 15:03.208
Yes, yes,
I-- I'm all right.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.959
- What happened here?
- Our cab hit this woman.

15:04.959 --> 15:07.917
- Because of her.
- It was not because of me.
I wasn't driving.

15:07.917 --> 15:10.458
Ma'am, let's take the driver's
and lady's statements, and then
we'll get yours.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.208
Okay, but you're not
gonna pin this on me,

15:12.208 --> 15:13.959
and I know enough
to ask for a lawyer.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.291
Please wait
in the cab.

15:15.291 --> 15:18.250
This is totally bogus, okay?
Let's just hop in another cab.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.291
No, we can't abandon
Adeem and Mary.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.166
She's totally fine.
The police are here, okay?

15:22.166 --> 15:24.500
And I'm very hungry.
Let's at least wait
in the deli.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.834
- Fine.
- Okay, we're gonna
be in the deli,

15:27.834 --> 15:29.875
and, Adeem, I don't
want to upset you,

15:29.875 --> 15:32.000
but the meter
is still running.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.834
What smells?

15:38.834 --> 15:40.959
Oh, it's probably me.
I don't wear deodorant.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.000
I'm sorry.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.708
They have
coconut popsicles?

15:43.708 --> 15:45.959
Oh, this was
the last one.

15:45.959 --> 15:48.166
- Do you want mine?
- No, I'm good.

15:49.959 --> 15:52.000
Do you resent me
for dating Adam?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.208
What? Uh, no,
I don't resent you.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.834
I would never resent
another woman for that
and place blame on her.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.041
That is just not how I roll.
If I was gonna resent anyone,

16:00.041 --> 16:01.708
I would resent him.
I don't resent you.

16:01.708 --> 16:05.625
So, why are you mad at Adam,
if you were mad at Adam?

16:05.625 --> 16:07.708
I'm not mad at Adam,
but if I was,

16:07.708 --> 16:09.375
it'd probably be
because he's deceitful

16:09.375 --> 16:12.041
and because he didn't
tell me he was in love
with someone else,

16:12.041 --> 16:13.750
if that's even a word
you two are using.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.375
Not yet.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.000
And I would also
be angry at him for
being a coward.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.041
Because he is a coward,
and then he lashes out
like a maniac

16:21.041 --> 16:24.208
when you call him on anything
because he feels so guilty.

16:24.208 --> 16:26.708
Yep, that is Adam
in a nutshell.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.208
Can I use your bathroom?

16:38.208 --> 16:39.625
We don't have a bathroom.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.166
You do have a bathroom.
I just saw it.

16:42.166 --> 16:45.166
I saw what was
most definitely
a toilet, dude.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.208
It's for employees only.

16:47.208 --> 16:50.000
Okay, well, can you
just maybe bend those rules

16:50.000 --> 16:53.875
because I'm gonna buy
all this stuff and I really,
really, really have to pee.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.959
Sorry, it's the rules.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.083
Seriously?
You know what?
Fuck this.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.667
- We're fucking out of here.
- She has to pay for
the popsicle.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.458
- She's not paying
for the popsicle.
- This is a protest.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.959
Hey! You can't steal
the popsicle!

17:04.959 --> 17:06.625
- There's probably
a bathroom in there.
- Okay!

17:06.625 --> 17:10.458
Excuse me, we're gonna
be in here now!

17:12.125 --> 17:13.500
Go! Go!

17:13.500 --> 17:15.416
Mimi-Rose:
You were ready to beat
me down, weren't you?

17:15.416 --> 17:17.250
- ( toilet flushes )
- Woman: I know, I was
ready to fuss--

17:17.250 --> 17:19.416
like, what is she doing
getting in my underwear?

17:19.416 --> 17:21.040
- Like, is this
bitch crazy?
- I know.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.625
- Oh, Hannah, meet
my new friend Chezza.
- Hi.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.791
She caught me trying
to slip a note into
her dryer mid-spin

17:25.791 --> 17:27.500
and she ran over.
She was like, "What
are you doing?"

17:27.500 --> 17:30.083
( Chezza laughs )
But it turns out she had
written me a poem.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.125
- Yeah, I always wanted
to give a stranger a poem.
- ( laughs )

17:33.125 --> 17:34.959
I was in that bathroom
for less than two minutes.

17:34.959 --> 17:37.291
It's actually
a pretty great poem.
You want to hear it?

17:37.291 --> 17:39.625
- No, thank you.
- I just gotta read
the first line.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.000
It's so beautiful
and touching.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.375
You know what, Chezza?
I told you I'm not in
the mood for a poem,

17:43.375 --> 17:45.125
but thank you so much.

17:46.458 --> 17:47.458
Okay.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.625
Never a dull
fucking moment

17:49.625 --> 17:51.417
in this fucking city.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.792
Hannah, do you still
want Adam back?

17:54.792 --> 17:56.625
Fuck, no.

17:56.625 --> 17:59.834
Because if you did,
that's something that
we should talk about.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.333
We don't need
to talk about it.
I don't want him back.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.208
You told Jessa
that you wanted him back.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.125
Fucking Jessa.

18:07.125 --> 18:10.000
She is insane, and,
anyway, I change my mind.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.834
And even if I didn't change
my mind, it wouldn't matter
because he's with you now.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.667
Well, if you actually
did want him back,

18:17.667 --> 18:20.000
I might say,
"You can have him."

18:23.333 --> 18:27.000
You are laying out
a beaver trap,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.625
and I'm not gonna walk
into your beaver trap.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.792
Hannah, there's no trap.

18:31.792 --> 18:34.667
I think Adam
is an extraordinary person,

18:34.667 --> 18:35.834
but I've only known him
for a few months.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.959
If you feel like you two
should really be together,

18:37.959 --> 18:41.166
then I am not gonna
stand in the way of that.

18:41.166 --> 18:44.583
And I think that
that is something
that we need to discuss.

18:44.583 --> 18:49.458
Okay, and how would
we go about discussing this?

18:49.458 --> 18:52.750
Well, I wouldn't
just give him to you,

18:52.750 --> 18:56.542
but I feel like
we could figure
something out.

18:59.542 --> 19:03.041
I would subtly
distance myself
from him

19:03.041 --> 19:06.542
as you incrementally
worked your way back
into his life.

19:06.542 --> 19:09.542
Perhaps through
a joint creative project.

19:09.542 --> 19:13.667
Okay, you are insane,
and that's insane.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.583
Are you mad because
you gave up on art

19:16.583 --> 19:20.000
or because
you gave up on Adam
or is it both?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.875
I didn't give up
on Adam, okay?

19:22.875 --> 19:24.417
You stole him from me.

19:24.417 --> 19:27.000
You swooped in
under the cover of night

19:27.000 --> 19:29.708
and you took him
while I was away
at graduate school

19:29.708 --> 19:32.792
getting a graduate degree
in a form of art that
is actual art,

19:32.792 --> 19:35.583
unlike what you do,
which is not art.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.917
And you're not a genius.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.250
You're just tricking people
and confusing them,

19:39.250 --> 19:41.041
and I think you know
it's bullshit,

19:41.041 --> 19:43.417
and I think maybe
you should just admit it.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.708
I just-- I...

19:48.333 --> 19:51.792
I don't know.
I saw this photograph
from the 1940s.

19:51.792 --> 19:55.291
Well, that has fucking
nothing to do with what
we're talking about.

19:55.291 --> 19:59.375
It was a picture
of this little girl.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.583
She was Japanese,
five or six,

20:01.583 --> 20:04.542
and she was
standing next to a row
of American soldiers

20:04.542 --> 20:07.542
on her way
to an internment camp.

20:07.542 --> 20:11.041
And the caption,
it just said, "Girl."

20:11.041 --> 20:13.458
I thought, "'Girl'?

20:13.458 --> 20:16.250
Do any of these soldiers
even know this girl's name?"

20:16.250 --> 20:19.458
They probably didn't.
They were, like,
war criminals.

20:19.458 --> 20:24.792
But I think it's so easy
for us to get so wrapped up
in ourselves and our own lives

20:24.792 --> 20:27.458
that we just completely
lose our empathy.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.458
We don't want to get
to know other people.

20:30.458 --> 20:31.875
And I get it.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.125
It's easier
to not ask and not tell.

20:34.125 --> 20:37.625
It's easier not to know
someone's name.

20:40.583 --> 20:43.583
Well, it sounds like
you know what you're doing.

20:43.583 --> 20:48.792
And I'm sorry that
learning more about you
physically pains me.

20:48.792 --> 20:51.375
Why does it pain you?

20:51.375 --> 20:54.333
Oh, I don't know,
because of your book

20:54.333 --> 20:55.458
that's gonna be
a best seller,

20:55.458 --> 20:56.917
because of your
smash-hit lectures,

20:56.917 --> 20:59.000
because of your
little doll face.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.542
You know, it pains me
to find out shit
about you, too.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.041
Oh, save it, please.

21:04.041 --> 21:06.000
No, it's the truth,
Hannah.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.417
( laughs )
I know that you
hated my show.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.708
And the way
that you see me,

21:11.708 --> 21:14.667
I'm afraid
that that's the way
everyone sees me.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.667
I just want
to make something
that says something,

21:18.667 --> 21:21.542
and I don't even
know why anymore.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.208
You try because
you're an artist.

21:35.208 --> 21:38.250
And I couldn't do it,
so I quit.

21:38.250 --> 21:41.375
Now I'm gonna have
a boring life like
my mother's,

21:41.375 --> 21:43.542
be dissatisfied,
and I'm gonna be normal.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.291
Do you think
I want to be normal?

21:46.291 --> 21:49.875
I just wasn't talented enough,
and that is why I left Iowa.

21:55.875 --> 22:00.375
I think that we
should just go to the bar
and start drinking heavily.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.417
Let's get outta here.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.542
( music playing )

22:13.500 --> 22:15.250
Jessa:
Isn't Ace the coolest?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.667
Adam:
Fuck, no!

22:16.667 --> 22:18.375
He told me he was
gonna get M-R back.

22:18.375 --> 22:19.708
Said he was kidding,
but he wasn't.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.417
- He said that?
- Yeah.

22:21.417 --> 22:24.125
- He said he wanted her back?
- Yeah, he said she's playing
some kind of game

22:24.125 --> 22:25.500
and he always
gets her back.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.667
He's a fuckin' psycho.

22:27.667 --> 22:28.917
No.

22:28.917 --> 22:30.542
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

22:30.542 --> 22:32.500
He didn't
really say that.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.583
Yeah, why?

22:34.583 --> 22:37.375
This is the whole reason
why I set you up with her

22:37.375 --> 22:39.583
is so that
I could get Ace.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.708
He's not supposed
to still want her back.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.125
He's supposed
to love me now.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.750
Oh.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.375
I don't buy it.
He loves me.

22:52.375 --> 22:55.625
I'll be pregnant
with his twins by May.

22:59.333 --> 23:03.125
- Congratulations!
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.

23:03.959 --> 23:07.333
( squeals )
Oh, my God! Hi.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.125
You came.
Oh, you look so terrific.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.750
Woman:
Congratulations,
fancy lady.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.875
- Hey.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

23:14.875 --> 23:16.667
- Hey, sorry.
- Hey.

23:16.667 --> 23:19.333
You're probably
still mad at me
or whatever.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.375
No, I-- I am not trying
to make you unhappy.

23:21.375 --> 23:22.708
I don't want you
to be unhappy.

23:22.708 --> 23:23.875
I just want
everyone to be happy.

23:23.875 --> 23:26.083
I know, I feel
the exact same way.

23:26.083 --> 23:29.166
I just wanted to tell you
that I really like Mimi-Rose.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.458
Oh, okay.
All right, thank you.

23:30.458 --> 23:34.291
I'm not kidding, okay?
I think she's a really
special,

23:34.291 --> 23:36.083
unique, neat person,

23:36.083 --> 23:37.792
and my eyes have been
totally opened

23:37.792 --> 23:40.166
and I just-- I wanted
to let you know that

23:40.166 --> 23:42.166
and just say
congratulations,

23:42.166 --> 23:45.375
and I just wanted
to say that I...

23:45.375 --> 23:47.625
get it.

23:49.125 --> 23:51.291
So now I'll get out of here
before I make it bad again,

23:51.291 --> 23:54.458
but I just wanted
to say that and...

23:57.333 --> 23:59.500
Okay, thank you.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.875
Excuse me.

24:09.333 --> 24:12.750
Hey, um, can I get
a falafel sandwich
and a seltzer, please?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.125
What's your name?

24:14.125 --> 24:18.083
Oh, my name is Hannah.
What is your name?

24:18.083 --> 24:20.417
We'll call you
when it's ready.
