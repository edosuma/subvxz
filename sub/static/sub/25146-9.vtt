WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:04.705
When we said that "World of Dance"

00:04.854 --> 00:06.981
was the biggest dance competition
in the world,

00:08.461 --> 00:11.061
we told you we were not playing.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.612
This is a dream come true to me.

00:14.612 --> 00:17.112
And I just can't believe
I made it this far.

00:17.112 --> 00:19.345
Since day one,
we've been talking about

00:19.345 --> 00:21.145
how badly we want this.

00:21.597 --> 00:22.663
__

00:22.710 --> 00:23.610
__

00:25.812 --> 00:27.179
__

00:28.445 --> 00:30.512
This is all of our hard work culminating

00:30.512 --> 00:31.845
into this very moment.

00:31.845 --> 00:32.430
We want to take this thing.

00:32.945 --> 00:33.338
Tonight...

00:36.507 --> 00:38.740
it's the Divisional Final.

00:38.740 --> 00:41.940
The remaining two acts
from each division

00:41.940 --> 00:43.007
will go head-to-head

00:43.007 --> 00:45.507
for a place in the World Final

00:45.507 --> 00:48.274
and the chance at one million dollars.

00:50.374 --> 00:51.907
We're at the Divisional Finals.

00:51.907 --> 00:54.340
To fall short at this stage

00:54.340 --> 00:55.774
would be devastating.

00:55.774 --> 00:57.874
You have to just leave
everything on the floor.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.007
It's do or die at this point.

01:01.007 --> 01:03.407
The Junior Division...

01:05.074 --> 01:07.140
Diana Pombo.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.340
You danced your heart out.

01:09.340 --> 01:12.274
Versus Eva Igo.

01:12.274 --> 01:14.640
You came out for blood tonight.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.507
The Team Division...

01:16.507 --> 01:18.240
Swing Latino...

01:20.540 --> 01:23.474
I felt the same thing you feel
when I perform.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.474
This is who I am.

01:25.474 --> 01:28.574
Versus Kinjaz.

01:28.574 --> 01:30.874
It was amazing.
It was moving.

01:30.874 --> 01:32.574
The Upper Division...

01:32.574 --> 01:34.907
Keone and Mari...

01:34.907 --> 01:37.307
That's magic.
Nobody else can do what you do.

01:37.307 --> 01:40.307
Versus Les Twins.

01:41.707 --> 01:43.953
__

01:48.199 --> 01:48.802
__

01:48.840 --> 01:51.074
__

01:54.226 --> 01:56.292
Two acts enter,

01:56.292 --> 01:58.192
one survives.

01:59.192 --> 02:01.392
This is...

02:01.392 --> 02:03.759
"World of Dance."

02:05.959 --> 02:09.059
Please welcome your host,
Jenna Dewan Tatum.

02:11.692 --> 02:14.059
And your judges,

02:14.059 --> 02:16.426
Derek Hough,

02:16.426 --> 02:19.792
NE-YO,

02:19.792 --> 02:21.459
and Jennifer Lopez.

02:24.026 --> 02:26.059
So we have two acts left

02:26.059 --> 02:28.259
in each of
the Juniors, Uppers, and Teams.

02:28.259 --> 02:30.959
Six acts, only three can stay.

02:30.959 --> 02:32.359
This is "World of Dance."

02:32.359 --> 02:34.926
The Divisional Final starts now!

02:41.692 --> 02:43.692
Up first,
the Team Division.

02:45.159 --> 02:47.492
It's Kinjaz versus Swing Latino.

02:50.092 --> 02:51.092
Hey!

02:51.092 --> 02:52.426
Over the last weeks,

02:52.426 --> 02:53.959
Kinjaz have transformed the stage

02:53.959 --> 02:55.792
with their cinematic choreography.

02:55.792 --> 02:58.059
It was like a movie.
It was so cool.

03:00.026 --> 03:02.759
Swing Latino have wowed the judges

03:02.759 --> 03:04.526
with explosive energy and tricks.

03:09.559 --> 03:12.459
Both teams have
very different strengths.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.992
They've beaten 13 other acts
to get this far.

03:14.992 --> 03:17.192
That million dollars
is within their reach.

03:17.192 --> 03:20.792
Performing first, it's Kinjaz.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.059
Hi, guys.

03:22.059 --> 03:23.259
Hey.

03:23.259 --> 03:25.559
You made it to the top two.

03:26.399 --> 03:26.892
Yeah...

03:26.892 --> 03:28.326
We're ready to make Jennifer proud.

03:28.326 --> 03:30.592
We're super ready to
go up against Swing Latino.

03:30.592 --> 03:31.959
I was just--
I was just thinking,

03:31.959 --> 03:35.926
"Okay, how do we out-energy
Swing Latino?"

03:35.926 --> 03:37.426
It's--not gonna happen.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.626
Yeah.

03:38.626 --> 03:40.692
But you have to create
enough impact

03:40.692 --> 03:43.192
for the audience that
they feel like you did.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.326
Do you have a concept that
you're working with right now?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.992
We really wanted to dedicate this one

03:47.992 --> 03:50.592
for the people that
support and love us.

03:50.592 --> 03:52.192
For some of us, our parents

03:52.192 --> 03:54.059
were directly affected
by the Vietnam War.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.492
They had to survive in order
to give us opportunity.

03:56.492 --> 03:58.526
This number is specifically
created for them.

03:58.526 --> 04:00.392
I like that.
Surprise me.

04:00.392 --> 04:02.659
Make me cry.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.926
This particular routine symbolizes that

04:04.926 --> 04:07.626
our parents succeeded.

04:07.626 --> 04:10.326
One shoulder on here,
and then the support right here.

04:10.326 --> 04:12.392
And you'll see us constantly
reaching for something.

04:12.392 --> 04:15.426
And when we come together
to form this mountain,

04:15.426 --> 04:17.291
we can reach those--
those goals.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.059
Kinjaz.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.591
So, this is obviously

04:21.591 --> 04:22.959
a huge moment in the competition.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.159
How are you guys feeling?

04:24.159 --> 04:26.592
Me? I--I feel incredible to just

04:26.592 --> 04:28.859
share such a really special
moment with these guys.

04:28.859 --> 04:30.626
Like, nobody can
take that away from us.

04:35.026 --> 04:36.403
We currently hold
a one-in-six chance

04:36.437 --> 04:37.803
of taking home a million dollars.

04:37.803 --> 04:38.837
That's a life changer.

04:46.037 --> 04:47.403
Divisional Finals.

04:47.403 --> 04:50.037
Okay.
Here we go.

04:57.903 --> 05:00.603
Kinjaz, to overcome

05:00.603 --> 05:03.337
your greatest obstacle,

05:03.337 --> 05:04.737
you must work together

05:04.737 --> 05:06.670
to achieve what one cannot.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:20.403 --> 06:22.037
Yes!

06:25.403 --> 06:27.137
Kinjaz, Kinjaz, Kinjaz,

06:27.137 --> 06:28.403
what's going on, guys?
Y'all good?

06:28.403 --> 06:29.770
We're happy to be here, yes.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.537
The piece was amazing.

06:32.537 --> 06:33.903
Like, nobody can match
your precision.

06:33.903 --> 06:35.303
That's a definite.

06:35.303 --> 06:37.303
But I feel like the energy level
of the piece itself,

06:37.303 --> 06:39.603
like, where was that one
magic Kinjaz moment?

06:39.603 --> 06:41.303
You know what I mean?
We didn't get that this time.

06:41.303 --> 06:43.837
I think the magic moment is
in their precision.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.703
There was definitely moments
when they just did, like,

06:45.703 --> 06:46.970
they moved their shoulder,
bah-bah.

06:46.970 --> 06:47.970
And I was like, "Whoo!"

06:49.870 --> 06:51.203
It was crazy clean.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.037
And it was a bottled-up,
controlled emotion

06:54.037 --> 06:55.537
that, as a group,

06:55.537 --> 07:00.103
had a power that
really blew me away.

07:00.103 --> 07:02.603
We're down to the last two
in each category.

07:02.603 --> 07:04.570
And I think Swing Latino's
gonna have to

07:04.570 --> 07:06.770
bring something just as special

07:06.770 --> 07:08.637
and just as emotionally moving

07:08.637 --> 07:09.770
to beat you.

07:11.237 --> 07:12.703
Oof.

07:12.703 --> 07:14.137
What's "nervous" in Spanish?

07:14.137 --> 07:15.770
- Nerviosa.
- Nerviosa.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.703
All right, guys.
Let's lock in scores.

07:27.770 --> 07:29.737
All right, Kinjaz.
Let's check out your scores.

07:32.403 --> 07:33.403
Give us the scores.

07:45.570 --> 07:49.670
92.3, score to beat for you guys.

07:54.119 --> 07:55.442
__

07:55.685 --> 07:56.362
__

07:56.403 --> 07:57.703
That precision was crazy.

07:57.703 --> 07:59.170
Is it enough to beat Swing Latino?

07:59.170 --> 08:00.237
- That's true.
- Is it?

08:00.237 --> 08:01.337
I don't know.

08:04.337 --> 08:07.170
Coming up...

08:07.170 --> 08:09.170
each division will battle it out

08:09.170 --> 08:11.237
to claim their spot
in the World Final.

08:15.337 --> 08:17.703
You guys embody "World of Dance."

08:23.170 --> 08:25.303
Crystal clear story.

08:25.303 --> 08:27.470
You have what it takes
to win this entire thing.

08:28.970 --> 08:30.037
Wait up, hold up.

08:40.937 --> 08:41.437
Next up in the team division

08:42.070 --> 08:43.970
Swing Latino,

08:43.970 --> 08:46.470
who must score
higher than a 92.3

08:46.470 --> 08:47.870
to beat Kinjaz.

08:49.172 --> 08:49.703
Hi, guys.

08:51.203 --> 08:53.737
Let's look at what
you have put together.

09:01.837 --> 09:03.570
I don't know, like, I feel like
there's something else

09:03.570 --> 09:05.437
that can be done, like.

09:05.437 --> 09:07.203
Going up against the Kinjaz,

09:07.203 --> 09:09.103
whatever you guys do,

09:09.103 --> 09:10.970
it's gonna have to--
to have that--

09:10.970 --> 09:13.003
that next-level concept.

09:13.003 --> 09:14.703
It could be a concept of, like,

09:14.703 --> 09:16.570
how all Latinos,
we're so different,

09:16.570 --> 09:18.037
but we're the same.

09:18.037 --> 09:20.646
__

09:21.435 --> 09:24.962
__

09:25.123 --> 09:25.960
__

09:26.303 --> 09:29.390
__

09:32.212 --> 09:33.988
__

09:34.070 --> 09:35.903
Next up on stage,

09:35.903 --> 09:38.303
it's Swing Latino.

09:38.303 --> 09:40.627
__

09:40.727 --> 09:43.142
__

09:43.242 --> 09:44.818
__

09:44.818 --> 09:45.818
__

11:24.403 --> 11:25.803
- Oh!
- Hey!

11:44.503 --> 11:47.237
That--I mean--listen.

11:47.237 --> 11:49.737
You--you guys embody
"World of Dance."

11:49.737 --> 11:50.870
- I mean, with all the flags...
- Yes.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.403
I mean, it's just like literally

11:52.403 --> 11:54.137
there's "World of Dance" right there.

11:56.703 --> 11:57.970
Unbelievable.

11:57.970 --> 11:59.303
Again, the fact that you were dancing

11:59.303 --> 12:01.403
on top of that platform,
I mean, that--

12:01.403 --> 12:02.837
how are you guys' shoulders,
by the way?

12:02.837 --> 12:04.703
You're sitting there;
there's dancing up there.

12:05.803 --> 12:06.970
This wasn't the cleanest

12:06.970 --> 12:08.003
performance
I've seen from you guys.

12:08.003 --> 12:09.303
But with that said,

12:09.303 --> 12:10.537
you make up for it
in so many other ways.

12:10.537 --> 12:11.737
Yeah, also I believe

12:11.737 --> 12:13.237
it was just
such an ambitious piece.

12:13.237 --> 12:15.370
They did so many different
styles of Latin dances.

12:15.370 --> 12:19.503
You did samba, bachata, tango.

12:19.503 --> 12:21.937
- Merengue.
- Uh, Merengue. Salsa.

12:21.937 --> 12:24.403
They were representing
for everybody.

12:24.403 --> 12:26.203
It was a beautiful thing
that you did that,

12:26.203 --> 12:28.037
that you even took my note

12:28.037 --> 12:29.903
and decided to do
something like this.

12:29.903 --> 12:31.670
Because here in
the United States,

12:31.670 --> 12:32.920
it doesn't matter...

12:33.935 --> 12:35.770
it doesn't matter
if you're Colombian,

12:35.770 --> 12:39.003
or Puerto Rican,
or Cuban, or Dominican,

12:39.003 --> 12:40.070
you're Latino here.

12:40.070 --> 12:41.437
- Latino.
- Okay?

12:41.437 --> 12:42.737
- That's what we are.
- Latinos in the house!

12:42.737 --> 12:45.737
Yeah!

12:45.737 --> 12:48.003
That's right.

12:48.003 --> 12:50.703
Latinos have so much
to offer the world, I feel.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.770
And it--it's such--

12:52.770 --> 12:55.870
I--I got emotional because
I felt--I felt--I felt

12:55.870 --> 12:58.170
the same thing you feel
when I perform,

12:58.170 --> 13:00.637
which is "This is who I am."

13:00.637 --> 13:03.003
"This is who I am.
Take me or leave me."

13:03.003 --> 13:04.403
But I have a lot to give.

13:04.403 --> 13:07.370
__

13:07.370 --> 13:08.837
You guys are going up
against the Kinjaz.

13:08.837 --> 13:11.570
And this is definitely not
a one-sided competition.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.703
One thing that translates
in any language is passion.

13:13.703 --> 13:14.803
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

13:14.803 --> 13:16.170
And beyond-- beyond anything else,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.670
you guys are passion.

13:20.003 --> 13:22.037
All right, we're gonna
lock in the scores.

13:23.337 --> 13:25.003
Kinjaz, let's go out there.

13:25.003 --> 13:26.803
Let's see what their score is.
Let's go.

13:35.937 --> 13:37.137
In, okay.

13:37.137 --> 13:40.303
Kinjaz, you scored 92.3
from the judges.

13:40.303 --> 13:43.370
Swing Latino,
you need more than 92.3

13:43.370 --> 13:45.437
to be Divisional Champions.

13:45.437 --> 13:48.203
Let's see who's taking the spot
in the World Final.

14:11.603 --> 14:12.970
The winner of the Team Division

14:12.970 --> 14:14.670
is Swing Latino!

14:20.537 --> 14:23.203
Kinjaz, it has been
an absolute privilege

14:23.203 --> 14:24.470
having you guys
on this competition.

14:24.470 --> 14:26.103
Judges, what do you want
to say to them?

14:26.103 --> 14:28.803
You should be amazingly
proud of yourselves.

14:28.803 --> 14:31.670
We love you,
and we wish you the best.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.037
Thank you guys so much.

14:33.037 --> 14:34.703
We still want to be Kinjaz!

14:36.470 --> 14:37.903
We definitely want to
congratulate Swing Latino,

14:37.903 --> 14:39.037
you know, and all
the other performers.

14:42.903 --> 14:44.670
Swing Latino,

14:44.670 --> 14:46.003
you've won your division,

14:46.003 --> 14:48.170
you've made it through
to the World Finals.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.603
You are one step closer

14:50.603 --> 14:52.237
to a million dollars.

14:52.237 --> 14:53.470
Congratulations, guys.

14:55.903 --> 15:00.061
__

15:00.103 --> 15:03.137
__

15:07.137 --> 15:08.503
Coming up...

15:12.303 --> 15:14.070
That is what wins competitions.

15:16.037 --> 15:17.803
The doctor said that things were serious.

15:17.803 --> 15:18.870
This is no joke.

15:27.581 --> 15:29.470
Next up the upper division

15:29.481 --> 15:30.914
It's Keone and Mari

15:30.914 --> 15:32.047
versus Les Twins.

15:36.247 --> 15:38.114
Keone and Mari
have shown us all the emotions

15:38.114 --> 15:40.881
of their marriage within
their razor-sharp

15:40.881 --> 15:43.414
modern partner dancing.

15:43.414 --> 15:44.781
It is a beautiful thing to watch.

15:44.781 --> 15:46.281
Unbelievable.

15:49.347 --> 15:52.081
Les Twins are the highest scoring act

15:52.081 --> 15:53.814
so far in the competition.

15:53.814 --> 15:56.014
They move in and out of sync
with each other

15:56.014 --> 15:58.881
with such natural rhythm.

16:00.281 --> 16:02.314
They're performing moves
no one else can do.

16:03.314 --> 16:04.447
Hey!

16:04.447 --> 16:06.314
They've survived three rounds

16:06.314 --> 16:08.014
at the world's toughest competition

16:08.014 --> 16:09.381
to get here tonight.

16:09.381 --> 16:11.547
This is the battle of the power duos.

16:13.314 --> 16:16.581
Up first, Keone and Mari.

16:16.581 --> 16:18.314
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

16:18.314 --> 16:19.447
Hello.

16:19.447 --> 16:20.614
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

16:20.614 --> 16:21.747
What are you guys gonna do

16:21.747 --> 16:23.081
that's gonna win it for you?

16:23.081 --> 16:25.281
The storytelling is
what we always try to bring.

16:25.281 --> 16:29.347
So it was actually
the first dance at our wedding.

16:29.347 --> 16:30.481
Ah, okay.

16:30.481 --> 16:31.547
A song that's very important to us.

16:31.547 --> 16:32.614
- It's our song.
- Yeah.

16:32.614 --> 16:33.747
I dig it.
I dig it.

16:40.914 --> 16:43.514
There are two very,
very powerful connections

16:43.514 --> 16:45.147
going head-to-head right now.

16:45.147 --> 16:47.681
There's the connection between
a husband and a wife.

16:47.681 --> 16:49.581
But then there's the connection
between two brothers.

16:49.581 --> 16:51.114
It's gonna be interesting to watch.

16:51.114 --> 16:53.214
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

16:53.214 --> 16:54.814
I love that it's
a little bit of the old,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.214
a little bit of the new.

16:56.214 --> 16:58.814
This has such
a "Fred and Ginger" feel to it,

16:58.814 --> 17:00.981
I would love for you guys
to go here just one time.

17:00.981 --> 17:02.514
- Just--just once.
- okay.

17:05.181 --> 17:07.080
I think we knew that
if we wanted to get far

17:07.080 --> 17:08.414
in this competition,
that we would have to

17:08.414 --> 17:09.446
go through the twins
at one point.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.781
Next up on stage,

17:10.781 --> 17:12.214
Keone and Mari.

17:12.214 --> 17:14.146
We're ready to fight for this.

17:14.146 --> 17:17.481
We've been saving this piece for them.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.681
All right.
Let's see Keone and Mari.

17:21.681 --> 17:23.547
This is it.
Now or never.

17:23.547 --> 17:24.681
Here we go.

19:12.881 --> 19:14.014
They got you.

19:14.014 --> 19:15.381
- They got you.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:15.381 --> 19:17.714
- They got you!
- I got the chills!

19:17.714 --> 19:20.381
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:20.381 --> 19:22.914
Keone and Mari!

19:22.914 --> 19:24.747
You just make me feel good.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.781
You guys are, like,
so smart in your choreography.

19:29.981 --> 19:31.414
My only, like, little critique,

19:31.414 --> 19:33.114
if I were to add something
in there, was

19:33.114 --> 19:35.114
you know that little lift there,
when you walk around?

19:35.114 --> 19:36.447
It was a little like ,
little shaky, but...

19:36.447 --> 19:37.647
I have to disagree a little bit.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.881
I feel like the lift was really clean.

19:39.881 --> 19:41.781
And your power, your strength,

19:41.781 --> 19:44.681
it's your ability to tell
a crystal clear story.

19:44.681 --> 19:46.781
And I applaud you for that.

19:46.781 --> 19:49.014
As I was watching that,
I was thinking,

19:49.014 --> 19:51.847
"Wow, this is like Fred and Ginger
for a new generation."

19:51.847 --> 19:52.981
When the rose petals started falling,

19:52.981 --> 19:54.023
I was like "Oh!"

19:55.047 --> 19:56.314
- Oh, my God.
- But her reaction--

19:56.314 --> 19:57.714
- her reaction to the proposal.
- Yes.

19:57.714 --> 19:59.481
Yes, I was like,
"Oh, my God, she said yes."

20:01.414 --> 20:02.747
The sad truth is that

20:02.747 --> 20:04.481
we're gonna lose
half of everybody today.

20:04.481 --> 20:06.781
- So we have to do the scores.
- Yeah.

20:17.614 --> 20:19.481
All right, let's find out your scores.

20:19.481 --> 20:20.647
Good luck.

20:33.747 --> 20:36.481
Oh!

20:36.481 --> 20:38.747
There you go!

20:43.514 --> 20:45.147
Yes, yes, yes.

20:45.147 --> 20:46.747
Yes!

20:51.181 --> 20:52.647
That is what wins competitions.

20:52.647 --> 20:53.847
Go on, brother.
Go on with your hundred.

20:53.847 --> 20:55.347
That is what wins competitions.

20:55.347 --> 20:56.781
Go with the hundred, NE-YO.

21:03.781 --> 21:05.147
- It was perfect to you?
- What? It was perfect.

21:05.147 --> 21:07.047
- It was perfect?
- It was perfect.

21:07.047 --> 21:08.347
- All right.
- Hands down.

21:08.347 --> 21:10.747
Okay.
What's happening over here?

21:11.067 --> 21:12.323
__

21:12.381 --> 21:13.781
You can't stand up at all?

21:13.781 --> 21:15.114
I--

21:15.358 --> 21:16.864
__

21:24.247 --> 21:25.014
Keone and Mari
scored a 95.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.781
Up next in the Upper Division,

21:29.781 --> 21:32.414
Les Twins.

21:36.681 --> 21:39.414
This week, something went
horribly wrong.

21:41.181 --> 21:42.614
Laurent was injured.

21:47.781 --> 21:48.922
__

21:49.079 --> 21:49.649
__

21:49.649 --> 21:50.218
__

21:50.318 --> 21:52.190
__

21:52.581 --> 21:53.781
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

21:53.862 --> 21:55.132
__

21:55.232 --> 21:56.232
__

21:56.781 --> 21:58.414
No, this can't happen,
not at this level,

21:58.414 --> 21:59.947
not right here
in this competition.

22:00.164 --> 22:02.223
__

22:02.281 --> 22:04.514
We all just were in complete shock.

22:04.514 --> 22:07.414
Guys, give it up for him!

22:07.414 --> 22:10.047
It could cost them
a million dollars.

22:14.647 --> 22:17.614
I was dancing and j--
I just twisted my whole leg

22:17.614 --> 22:19.214
on the floor.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.214
And I didn't believe
that happened

22:20.214 --> 22:22.381
till I could not walk anymore.

22:22.381 --> 22:24.814
The doctor said that
thing's serious.

22:24.814 --> 22:26.347
It's just--this is no joke.

22:26.347 --> 22:29.647
And at the hospital,
I was like...

22:31.181 --> 22:32.781
The competition--
the competition is dead.

22:32.781 --> 22:34.381
I cannot do anything anymore.

22:34.381 --> 22:37.247
Most likely, had a little
probably tear right through here

22:37.247 --> 22:39.381
We need to shut you down
for a couple days.

22:39.381 --> 22:41.947
And my brother was like,

22:41.947 --> 22:43.314
"Yeah, so what we gonna do?"
Like...

22:48.214 --> 22:50.247
I put everything on my brother.

22:50.247 --> 22:53.081
And I tell myself that
you don't give up.

22:53.267 --> 22:55.946
__

22:56.014 --> 22:58.181
Everything--
everything is on ideas

22:58.181 --> 23:00.681
and the creation that
me and my brother put together.

23:00.681 --> 23:01.781
To dance with a...

23:01.781 --> 23:03.914
messed-up leg.

23:03.914 --> 23:05.814
Tell me where--where
our minds are at right now.

23:05.814 --> 23:07.047
How do we--
how do we feel?

23:07.047 --> 23:08.814
It's always a yin and yang,

23:08.814 --> 23:10.214
on the part of the twins.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.814
- I get hurt more than him.
- Mm.

23:12.814 --> 23:14.381
You know, because, uh,

23:14.381 --> 23:16.381
his mind is good
'cause he--he feel the pain.

23:16.381 --> 23:18.847
But because I don't feel
the pain, I'm really in pain.

23:18.847 --> 23:22.047
Don't feel like you're
at a disadvantage by this,

23:22.047 --> 23:23.247
'cause you're not.

23:23.247 --> 23:24.881
There's Keone and Mari,
who are--

23:24.881 --> 23:26.581
a husband and wife connection,
which is a strong connection.

23:26.581 --> 23:28.547
- Strong.
- But then there's the

23:28.547 --> 23:29.681
not only brotherly connection,

23:29.681 --> 23:32.347
but the twin brother connection.

23:32.347 --> 23:33.847
If y'all can tap into that,

23:33.847 --> 23:35.447
you could beat them.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.447
NE-YO is really make us feel like,

23:37.447 --> 23:39.147
"All right, work is not done.

23:39.147 --> 23:40.747
This--we cannot stop here."

23:45.281 --> 23:48.114
Now, for Les Twins,
it's gonna be about--

23:48.114 --> 23:49.747
it's gonna be about
an emotional connection.

23:58.068 --> 24:00.387
__

24:00.487 --> 24:02.203
__

24:02.303 --> 24:04.796
__

24:09.581 --> 24:11.214
Next on stage,

24:11.214 --> 24:13.081
it's Les Twins.

24:28.033 --> 24:28.989
__

24:29.214 --> 24:31.047
- What'd he just say?
- "No mercy."

26:03.647 --> 26:05.781
Okay, okay.

26:05.781 --> 26:08.737
__

26:08.914 --> 26:11.414
This was probably
your more powerful pieces,

26:11.414 --> 26:13.014
and a really good way to take

26:13.014 --> 26:14.914
something that was a negative

26:14.914 --> 26:16.647
and turn it into a positive.

26:16.647 --> 26:17.981
Absolutely.

26:17.981 --> 26:19.814
This is the round
before the finals.

26:19.814 --> 26:21.681
The narrative was crystal clear.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.647
It was emotional.
It was heartfelt.

26:23.647 --> 26:24.647
And when that beat dropped,

26:24.647 --> 26:26.081
and you guys--the musicality,

26:26.081 --> 26:28.014
I was like, "Okay, here we go.
Here's Les Twins."

26:28.014 --> 26:30.981
And also the classic Les Twins
hairdo going on right now, too.

26:30.981 --> 26:33.014
I love it, I love it.

26:33.014 --> 26:34.414
I gotta say to you, Laurent,

26:34.414 --> 26:37.814
you are just as dynamic
with one foot missing.

26:37.814 --> 26:39.681
The chair, in my personal opinion,

26:39.681 --> 26:40.747
took nothing away from you,

26:40.747 --> 26:41.781
'cause once you started moving

26:41.781 --> 26:43.247
and once the beat kicked in,

26:43.247 --> 26:44.747
you might as well
have been standing up.

26:44.747 --> 26:45.914
It was that dynamic.

26:45.914 --> 26:46.947
Thank you.

26:46.947 --> 26:48.314
So I have a question.

26:48.314 --> 26:49.514
I mean, how--how
are you guys feeling right now,

26:49.514 --> 26:51.147
going up against
Keone and Mari right now?

26:51.147 --> 26:53.181
I will never just give up.

26:53.181 --> 26:55.481
Where I come from,
I born poor, in the streets,

26:55.481 --> 26:56.814
and I made it here.

26:56.814 --> 26:58.847
And I'm not gonna give up
'cause of this.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.514
A true performer knows how

27:04.514 --> 27:05.514
to face adversity.

27:05.514 --> 27:07.114
And you did that extremely well.

27:07.114 --> 27:08.914
So thank you for that,
and a great performance.

27:08.914 --> 27:10.347
This is gonna be
a difficult one to judge.

27:10.347 --> 27:12.114
All right, we're gonna
lock in our scores.

27:12.114 --> 27:13.647
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay.

27:13.647 --> 27:15.414
This is it,
let's go find their scores,

27:15.414 --> 27:18.047
see who's gonna be
the Upper Division Champion.

27:32.414 --> 27:33.947
- Locked in.
- Are you locked?

27:33.947 --> 27:36.781
Keone and Mari,
you scored 95 from the judges.

27:36.781 --> 27:39.547
Les Twins, you need more than 95

27:39.547 --> 27:40.814
to be Divisional Champions.

27:40.814 --> 27:41.914
Let's see who's taking the spot

27:41.914 --> 27:42.947
in the World Final.

27:58.481 --> 27:59.977
This is it.

28:00.314 --> 28:03.214
Keone and Mari,
you scored 95 from the judges.

28:03.214 --> 28:06.947
Les Twins,
you need more than 95

28:06.947 --> 28:08.114
to be Divisional Champions.

28:08.114 --> 28:09.481
Let's see who's taking the spot

28:09.481 --> 28:10.681
in the World Final.

28:32.247 --> 28:35.714
The winner of the Upper Division
is Les Twins.

28:38.914 --> 28:40.881
Slow down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.493
__

28:45.581 --> 28:47.981
Keone and Mari,
you two are--

28:47.981 --> 28:49.547
I mean, I'm, like, sick right now.

28:49.547 --> 28:52.014
- Me too. Me too.
- I feel sick to my stomach,

28:52.014 --> 28:53.647
because I love you so much.

28:53.647 --> 28:55.047
This is a competition.

28:55.047 --> 28:57.481
Unfortunately,
somebody has to go home.

28:57.481 --> 28:59.747
You made a name for yourself
in a way that

28:59.747 --> 29:01.547
everybody will remember.

29:07.381 --> 29:09.381
We left everything up there.

29:09.381 --> 29:13.347
And we did every--
everything we could have.

29:13.347 --> 29:15.314
Les Twins, you have won
the Upper Division

29:15.314 --> 29:17.247
and made it through
to the World Final.

29:17.247 --> 29:18.781
Congratulations!

29:18.781 --> 29:21.714
Please, give it up for Les Twins.

29:21.714 --> 29:23.714
One step closer to $1 million.

29:23.714 --> 29:25.481
Next week, my leg's gonna come back.

29:25.481 --> 29:27.481
And I--I cannot disappoint.

29:27.481 --> 29:28.747
Yes, yes, yes.

29:28.747 --> 29:31.381
'Cause if the show is 1 million,
yes.

29:34.114 --> 29:35.281
In the Junior Division,

29:35.281 --> 29:39.381
it's Diana Pombo versus Eva Igo.

29:40.814 --> 29:43.881
What Diana's doing
at 11 years old

29:43.881 --> 29:45.414
is mind-blowing.

29:45.414 --> 29:47.647
Over the last six weeks,
she's shown

29:47.647 --> 29:49.647
phenomenal strength
and technique.

29:49.647 --> 29:51.581
You got that Latin fire.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.447
- I can see it in you!
- Thank you.

29:53.447 --> 29:55.181
14-year-old Eva

29:55.181 --> 29:57.814
has grown more than
anyone in this competition.

29:57.814 --> 30:00.114
She's shown massive progress,

30:00.114 --> 30:01.614
because she's
become more vulnerable.

30:02.781 --> 30:05.297
You belong here, 110%.

30:05.447 --> 30:08.947
We've got two powerful
contemporary soloists

30:08.947 --> 30:10.414
going head-to-head.

30:10.414 --> 30:13.714
Up first, it's Diana Pombo.

30:13.714 --> 30:15.281
- Diana!
- Hi!

30:16.347 --> 30:18.614
It's you and Eva.

30:18.614 --> 30:20.714
How do you feel?

30:20.714 --> 30:23.681
I feel that doing something different

30:23.681 --> 30:25.181
will tell us apart.

30:25.181 --> 30:27.647
So I want to show that I'm a kid

30:27.647 --> 30:29.647
and dance is not just about,
like, being

30:29.647 --> 30:33.214
so slow and so, like,
into it and so emotional.

30:33.214 --> 30:34.981
It's--you could have fun too.

30:34.981 --> 30:36.914
Okay, cool, well, do you
want to show me some stuff?

30:40.181 --> 30:41.814
For Diana to win
the Divisional Final,

30:41.814 --> 30:43.281
I think that she just has to

30:43.281 --> 30:44.681
make sure that
her performance stays

30:44.681 --> 30:46.947
consistently childlike
throughout the routine.

30:48.781 --> 30:50.114
Whoo!

30:50.114 --> 30:51.714
And it could be towards
the audience.

30:51.714 --> 30:53.247
You can be, like,
bringing them in.

30:53.247 --> 30:54.614
Maybe you are
just skipping around,

30:54.614 --> 30:55.614
'cause you're
"Alice in Wonderland,"

30:55.614 --> 30:56.914
or you're "Diana in Wonderland."

30:57.914 --> 30:59.347
The emotion can be used

30:59.347 --> 31:01.414
in a playful, fun, edgy way

31:01.414 --> 31:03.181
that is--just--
it will feel different.

31:03.181 --> 31:04.681
Just go out there
and be Diana.

31:04.681 --> 31:06.447
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

31:06.447 --> 31:07.947
Of course.
Of course.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.714
Eva is so good...

31:14.114 --> 31:16.147
So I want to give it my all,

31:16.147 --> 31:18.447
and show the world why I dance.

31:18.447 --> 31:20.947
Next on stage,
Diana Pombo.

31:23.814 --> 31:25.114
Let's go!

31:26.981 --> 31:28.247
Here we go.

31:28.247 --> 31:31.547
Divisional Final already.

32:58.414 --> 33:00.214
Yeah, baby.

33:02.847 --> 33:04.381
Diana came to play!

33:09.114 --> 33:12.147
You know, I--
I love watching you dance

33:12.147 --> 33:14.447
'cause you're living in the moment

33:14.447 --> 33:17.847
in a way that
a lot of performers can't do.

33:17.847 --> 33:20.714
And that is such a gift that you have.

33:20.714 --> 33:22.714
Honestly, you give me chills
every time.

33:22.714 --> 33:24.647
- Every time.
- Thank you.

33:24.647 --> 33:26.547
So much.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.647
Diana, I'm so proud of you.

33:28.647 --> 33:31.047
When you're on that stage,
you absolutely take control

33:31.047 --> 33:32.314
and-and-and ownership of it,

33:32.314 --> 33:33.781
and it's--it's beautiful to watch.

33:33.781 --> 33:35.181
Thank you so much.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.714
I'm interested to see
how that performance

33:37.714 --> 33:39.114
goes up next to Eva,

33:39.114 --> 33:40.581
since that's who
you're competing against.

33:40.581 --> 33:41.814
But great job.
You should be very proud.

33:41.814 --> 33:43.514
- Thank you.
- Good job.

33:44.947 --> 33:47.347
I think you did
an absolutely fantastic job.

33:47.347 --> 33:48.981
I like the fact that

33:48.981 --> 33:50.581
there was a bit more dancing
in this one

33:50.581 --> 33:51.914
than what we've seen
from you before.

33:51.914 --> 33:53.281
I dug that.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.081
The one thing,
if I had to critique anything,

33:55.081 --> 33:56.214
is that, okay,

33:56.214 --> 33:57.581
the song is really upbeat.

33:57.581 --> 33:58.781
Your setting is really upbeat.

33:58.781 --> 34:01.181
But you have this "oh"
on your face

34:01.181 --> 34:03.247
that didn't really tie to

34:03.247 --> 34:04.581
everything else that was happy.

34:04.581 --> 34:05.814
I can feel what
you're feeling when I--

34:05.814 --> 34:06.814
when I watch you dance.

34:06.814 --> 34:08.014
Because I feel like there's

34:08.014 --> 34:09.347
a lot of angst in that,
you know?

34:09.347 --> 34:10.981
You have that--
you have that down to a T.

34:10.981 --> 34:12.847
But I love the moment
when you just smile.

34:12.847 --> 34:16.014
And you were that 11-year-old
girl up there, dancing.

34:16.014 --> 34:17.880
For me, that is so beautiful.

34:19.114 --> 34:20.681
We're gonna lock in our scores, okay?

34:20.681 --> 34:22.214
- Yes, locking it in.
- Okay.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.147
All right, baby doll,
let's see your scores.

34:38.746 --> 34:39.981
All right, Diana.

34:54.081 --> 34:55.181
That's good.

34:55.181 --> 34:57.847
Still a very high score, 89.3.

35:00.014 --> 35:02.247
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much!

35:02.247 --> 35:04.881
Let's see how it goes.
That's a strong score.

35:04.881 --> 35:06.314
- So we'll see if you can hold on.
- Thank you.

35:06.314 --> 35:07.947
Good job, Diana.

35:13.114 --> 35:14.881
Coming up...

35:19.547 --> 35:20.581
I got chills.

35:22.081 --> 35:24.414
Only one can go into the World Final.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.447
This is it.

35:33.214 --> 35:33.814
- Hi, Eva. Hi, Mom.
- Hello.

35:35.181 --> 35:36.981
How are both of you
feeling right now?

35:36.981 --> 35:38.147
Nervous and excited.

35:38.147 --> 35:39.147
How are you, Mom?

35:39.147 --> 35:40.114
Confident.

35:40.114 --> 35:41.147
Confident.

35:43.714 --> 35:45.347
Eva!

35:45.347 --> 35:47.181
Whoo!

35:47.181 --> 35:49.314
- What's up, girl?
- Nothing.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.581
Oh, oh, my gosh.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.047
You nervous?
Are you excited?

35:52.047 --> 35:53.447
Well...

35:53.447 --> 35:54.714
I believe in her so much.

35:54.714 --> 35:57.147
I really want her just to believe

35:57.147 --> 35:58.581
in herself as much as I do.

35:58.581 --> 36:02.347
My dance isn't as emotional
as "Creep" was last week.

36:02.347 --> 36:03.947
Which makes me
a little nervous, because

36:03.947 --> 36:05.914
I--I want to make sure
that you start strong.

36:07.881 --> 36:09.181
That first look--

36:09.181 --> 36:11.314
I want Miss Lopez--

36:11.314 --> 36:12.881
I want her to be like...

36:14.414 --> 36:16.847
I think Derek is seeing
the more confident side of me.

36:28.281 --> 36:30.147
What the heck, man?

36:30.147 --> 36:31.614
That was so good.
Okay.

36:31.614 --> 36:33.314
- Just keep that confidence.
- Okay.

36:37.347 --> 36:38.414
Diana's really amazing.

36:38.511 --> 36:40.544
But I've gotten to a point where

36:40.544 --> 36:42.111
I can let go of my insecurities

36:42.111 --> 36:43.378
and just be myself on the stage.

36:46.178 --> 36:46.971
I'm ready to fight.

36:52.113 --> 36:53.447
Let's go, Eva.

37:31.413 --> 37:32.480
Whoo!

38:37.247 --> 38:39.213
Oh, that was awesome.

38:39.213 --> 38:41.913
Clearly the crowd feels it.

38:41.913 --> 38:44.380
I want to know
how you feel right now.

38:44.380 --> 38:48.013
I feel a lot better
than I have ever felt.

38:49.247 --> 38:51.613
Last week,
and the weeks before that,

38:51.613 --> 38:53.913
I haven't really thought
that I was enough.

38:53.913 --> 38:57.680
And something
changed in me last week.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.980
- Yes, it did, baby.
- We could tell.

38:58.980 --> 39:00.280
- Yeah.
- Yes, it did.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.413
We could tell.

39:02.413 --> 39:04.847
The girl I saw the very first time
on this stage?

39:04.847 --> 39:07.480
I'll tell you,
I'm gonna be 100% honest,

39:07.480 --> 39:10.013
I was like, "She's amazing,

39:10.013 --> 39:12.613
but there's something missing."

39:12.613 --> 39:15.547
And that girl is not the same girl

39:15.547 --> 39:16.980
that just danced right now.

39:19.513 --> 39:20.813
Without sounding corny, but

39:20.813 --> 39:22.413
it's an Eva-lution.

39:22.981 --> 39:25.013
Whoo!

39:25.013 --> 39:27.713
I mean, when you came
off that thing,

39:27.713 --> 39:29.447
and you were like "boosh,"

39:29.447 --> 39:31.847
I was like, "I got chills."

39:32.653 --> 39:33.313
Thank you.

39:33.313 --> 39:35.347
Thank you so much.

39:35.347 --> 39:36.413
Are we ready to lock in scores?

39:36.413 --> 39:37.580
- Yep.
- Yes, baby.

39:37.580 --> 39:38.580
Let's do it.

39:41.113 --> 39:42.513
Okay, Diana, it's time.

39:42.513 --> 39:44.013
Let's go get her scores,
see who's gonna be

39:44.013 --> 39:45.013
the winner of the Junior Division.

39:45.013 --> 39:46.080
- Okay.
- Let's go.

40:00.747 --> 40:02.413
Okay, the scores are locked.

40:02.413 --> 40:04.847
Both acts from the Juniors
have performed.

40:04.847 --> 40:07.113
Only one can go into
the World Final.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.347
This is it.

40:08.347 --> 40:11.213
Diana, you scored 89.3
from the judges.

40:11.213 --> 40:14.347
Eva, you need more than 89.3

40:14.347 --> 40:15.947
to be Divisional Champion.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.747
Let's see who's taking the spot
in the World Final.

40:40.380 --> 40:41.880
96.7.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.413
The winner of the Junior Division

40:43.413 --> 40:44.813
is Eva Igo.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.447
Oh, my God.

40:59.213 --> 41:01.180
Congratulations.

41:01.180 --> 41:04.113
Oh, Diana, my little baby.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.080
It was my pleasure to meet you

41:06.080 --> 41:08.380
and to talk with you

41:08.380 --> 41:09.747
and to watch you dance.

41:09.747 --> 41:11.147
Thank you.

41:11.147 --> 41:13.980
Look out, world, for this one.

41:13.980 --> 41:17.347
People, let's hear it
one more time for Diana Pombo.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.147
I'm super grateful

41:23.147 --> 41:25.413
to have been here.

41:25.413 --> 41:27.413
This is just
the beginning of my journey.

41:29.347 --> 41:31.447
Eva, you won the Junior Division.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.747
And you've made it through
to the World Finale.

41:33.747 --> 41:35.880
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.113
Eva, let me tell you right now,

41:38.113 --> 41:40.480
you have what it takes
to win this entire thing.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.747
To win the $1 million.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.747
I'm in the World Final.

41:51.080 --> 41:51.802
That's crazy.

41:53.213 --> 41:55.980
We have our three
Divisional Champions.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.947
From the Juniors,
it's Eva Igo;

41:57.947 --> 42:00.347
it's Les Twins
from the Uppers;

42:00.347 --> 42:02.747
and from the Team Division,
it's Swing Latino.

42:02.747 --> 42:04.680
Next time,
these three acts will compete

42:04.680 --> 42:07.713
for $1 million in the World Final.
