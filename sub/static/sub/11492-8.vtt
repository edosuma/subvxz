00:06.200 --> 00:09.335
Is Edward the gay vampire
or the gay werewolf?

00:09.336 --> 00:10.470
The vampire.

00:10.471 --> 00:13.906
And he's not gay,
he's... androgynous.

00:13.907 --> 00:18.144
So he can write
with both hands, big deal.

00:18.145 --> 00:20.246
No, I mean...

00:20.247 --> 00:21.347
Never mind.

00:21.348 --> 00:24.000

00:24.001 --> 00:25.818
Jackass 2.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.970
Now, I know what
you're thinking: sequels suck.

00:27.971 --> 00:29.055
But not that one.

00:29.056 --> 00:30.456
There's this one part
where this guy

00:30.457 --> 00:32.258
puts on a diver's helmet
with a hose attached,

00:32.259 --> 00:35.761
and this fat guy farts into
the tube until he pukes.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.799
The guy in the diver's helmet,
not the fat guy.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.834
Sounds puerile.

00:41.835 --> 00:45.004
Oh, yeah, it's totally puerile.

00:45.005 --> 00:47.073
Unless puerile isn't good.

00:47.074 --> 00:49.542
In which case,
it's totally un-puerile.

00:50.577 --> 00:52.812
Anti-puerile?

00:52.813 --> 00:55.014
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.451
Hello!

00:58.452 --> 01:00.152
Oh, crap.

No, worse.

01:38.525 --> 01:40.393

02:01.214 --> 02:03.316
Going out with Beth Anderson.

02:03.317 --> 02:05.117
She was head cheerleader.

02:05.118 --> 02:07.687
I was crazy about her,
but she dumped me

02:07.688 --> 02:10.590
and left me with nothing
but a broken heart.

02:10.591 --> 02:12.024

02:14.528 --> 02:18.097
Wow, you kids today have
no idea what that is, do you?

02:18.098 --> 02:19.398
I know it sounds cute.

02:19.399 --> 02:21.250
