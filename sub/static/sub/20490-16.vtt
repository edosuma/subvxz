00:01.521 --> 00:05.023
===MUTANT X Once Around / s02.ep16===

00:09.509 --> 00:11.111
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:11.111 --> 00:12.714
BEING THIS CLOSE TO A COURTHOUSE
GIVING YOU BAD MEMORIES?

00:12.714 --> 00:14.317
NO.

00:14.317 --> 00:15.919
I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH
MY TIME THAN SIT AROUND WAIT

00:15.919 --> 00:18.723
FOR SOME LOW-RENT HOOD.

00:19.123 --> 00:21.126
YEAH, A HOOD THAT HAPPENS
TO BE A KEY WITNESS IN PUTTING

00:21.126 --> 00:23.931
AWAY THE LEADER OF A MAJOR
CRIME SYNDICATE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:23.931 --> 00:25.133
EXACTLY.

00:25.534 --> 00:27.937
YOU KNOW, ADAM'S GOT US PULLING
BABYSITTING DUTY FOR SOME

00:27.937 --> 00:30.341
PUREBRED GRADE A RAT.

00:33.145 --> 00:35.549
HEY, UH, ONE
OF YOU GUYS WANT TO...

00:35.549 --> 00:37.552
WANT TO CRACK
THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING?

00:37.552 --> 00:40.357
I'M BURNING UP BACK HERE, UH?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.561
BETTER, PRINCESS?

00:43.962 --> 00:46.366
NO. NO, LOOK,
I DO NOT WORK WITH A/C.

00:46.366 --> 00:48.369
OKAY? IT DRIES UP MY SINUSES.

00:48.769 --> 00:51.172
WILL... WILL YOU
JUST CRACK A WINDOW?

00:56.381 --> 00:58.784
I THINK YOU'LL BE A LOT
HAPPIER ONCE VIC TESTIFIES.

00:58.784 --> 01:00.787
WITHOUT HIM, RAYMOND WALKS.

01:00.787 --> 01:04.794
THIRD TIME IN NEARLY A DECADE.

01:07.197 --> 01:10.403
HEY, SILVERMAN, GOOD LUCK TODAY.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.607
WHAT? ARE YOU
AFRAID TO SHAKE MY HAND?

01:14.007 --> 01:16.412
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.629 --> 01:30.032
YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:30.032 --> 01:33.638
I'VE GOT MY PEOPLE ESCORTING
VIC WHEN HE ARRIVES.

01:33.638 --> 01:36.041
YOU'VE GOT
THE DECOY CAR ARRIVING AT
THE BACK ENTRANCE, RIGHT?

01:36.041 --> 01:37.644
RIGHT.

01:37.644 --> 01:39.246
I FIGURE THAT'S WHERE RAYMOND'S
PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT VIC TO

01:39.647 --> 01:40.849
ENTER FROM IF THEY HAD
ANY INTENTION OF TAKING HIM OUT

01:41.249 --> 01:42.452
BEFORE HE TESTIFIES, SO...

01:42.452 --> 01:44.053
WE GOT IT COVERED.

01:48.059 --> 01:50.464
MY PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE
TO ESCORT VIC WHEN HE ARRIVES.

01:52.066 --> 01:53.267
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

01:59.678 --> 02:04.084
YEAH. VIC'S COMING
AROUND THE FRONT - NOW.

02:09.693 --> 02:10.895
LOOKS LIKE OUR
COMPANY'S ARRIVED.

02:12.497 --> 02:14.501
FBI. TWO IN THE BACK.

02:28.121 --> 02:30.525
LOOK, JUST SIT AND SHUT IT.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.730
FINE. BUT THIS IS
ALL GOING IN MY BOOK.

02:33.730 --> 02:36.934
CHAPTER 7: HOW I WAS TREATED
BY THE FBI AS A STAR WITNESS.

02:36.934 --> 02:38.537
GIMME THAT.

02:38.537 --> 02:40.540
HEY, HEY, THAT IS PRIVATE--

02:46.148 --> 02:48.151
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

02:50.154 --> 02:52.157
GO! GO!

02:55.763 --> 02:56.965
LOOK OUT!

03:00.170 --> 03:01.371
THANK YOU.

03:07.381 --> 03:09.384
COME ON!

03:15.794 --> 03:16.996
IS HE DEAD?

03:16.996 --> 03:18.999
NO. THE RAT GOT AWAY.

03:25.809 --> 03:27.411
I AM ADAM KANE.

03:27.411 --> 03:29.815
I WAS A PIONEER
OF GENETIC RESEARCH,

03:30.216 --> 03:33.822
MANIPULATING DNA
TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.626
BUT IN MANY THEIR
GENES UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED.

03:36.626 --> 03:40.632
THEY DEVELOPED
SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES.

04:08.675 --> 04:10.678
TOGETHER WITH FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL

04:10.678 --> 04:13.081
I FIGHT TO PROTECT A WORLD
THAT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WE EXIST.

04:17.087 --> 04:19.491
WE ARE... MUTANT X.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.443
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE WE FIND HIM.

04:31.443 --> 04:33.045
WELL, UNLESS RAYMOND'S
PEOPLE FIND HIM FIRST.

04:33.045 --> 04:34.648
ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DID RAYMOND'S
PEOPLE KNOW THAT HE WAS

04:34.648 --> 04:35.849
ARRIVING IN FRONT?

04:36.250 --> 04:37.452
YOU AND I ARE THE
ONLY PEOPLE WHO KNEW.

04:37.852 --> 04:40.657
EVEN THE
FBI MEN HAD NO SPECIFICS
OF WHO THEY'RE ESCORTING.

04:40.657 --> 04:42.259
ALL RIGHT, BUT THE LEAK
HAD TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

04:42.259 --> 04:43.461
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD THINK.

04:43.461 --> 04:45.063
LOOK, I'VE BEEN AFTER
THIS GUY FOR TEN YEARS.

04:45.063 --> 04:46.265
THEY CALL HIM
RAYMOND THE READER.

04:46.265 --> 04:47.868
HE CAN FIND OUT
ANYTHING ON ANYONE.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.069
WHAT?

04:49.069 --> 04:50.271
SO HE'S CONNECTED SOMEHOW?

04:50.672 --> 04:51.874
GOES BEYOND THAT.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.477
HE KNOWS THINGS
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

04:53.477 --> 04:55.880
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S BEEN
NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO

04:55.880 --> 04:58.283
BUILD A CASE AGAINST HIM?

04:58.283 --> 04:59.886
WELL, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

04:59.886 --> 05:02.289
ADAM, ALL I KNOW IS,
IF VIC DOESN'T SHOW UP SOON,

05:02.289 --> 05:05.895
THAT MONSTER
GETS ANOTHER FREE PASS.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.724
HEY.
-WHAT'S UP?

05:24.724 --> 05:27.929
DO... DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
YOUR ATTITUDE ABOUT VIC?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.932
WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

05:30.332 --> 05:33.137
I JUST DON'T
HOLD GUYS LIKE VIC IN THE
HIGHEST REGARD, THAT'S ALL.

05:33.137 --> 05:34.740
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, "GUYS LIKE VIC"?

05:34.740 --> 05:36.341
WELL, YOU KNOW...

05:36.743 --> 05:40.749
SOMEONE WHO WILL SELL OUT ANYONE
JUST TO SAVE THEIR OWN SKIN.

05:40.749 --> 05:43.152
HE'S JUST A LITTLE GUPPY
TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A BARRACUDA.

05:43.152 --> 05:44.755
YEAH, ISN'T THAT THE POINT?

05:44.755 --> 05:46.357
NO.

05:46.357 --> 05:48.360
FOR A RAT LIKE VIC, THE WHOLE
POINT IS "WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME"?

05:48.360 --> 05:50.363
SO IF VIC WERE TO END UP DEAD,

05:50.363 --> 05:52.767
ACCORDING TO YOU HE
JUST HAD THAT COMING, RIGHT?

05:53.167 --> 05:55.572
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

05:55.572 --> 05:59.177
YEAH. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.394
THE JUDGE GRANTED
PROSECUTION'S REQUEST

06:10.394 --> 06:12.798
FOR A FORTY-EIGHT
HOUR CONTINUANCE.

06:12.798 --> 06:14.400
PHH...
NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN, SAM.

06:14.801 --> 06:18.006
THERE'S NO WAY
THE DA'LL MANAGE TO PULL
A RABBIT OUT OF THEIR HAT.

06:18.406 --> 06:20.810
WELL, YOU SOUND
PRETTY CONFIDENT.

06:20.810 --> 06:22.412
VIC'S NO IDIOT.

06:22.412 --> 06:25.618
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.021
...ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.424
EVEN IF THEY FIND HIM, HOW
ANXIOUS DO YOU THINK HE'LL BE TO

06:30.825 --> 06:32.828
TESTIFY AGAINST YOU?

06:32.828 --> 06:36.433
BY NOW, WITNESS PROTECTION
WILL LOOK LIKE TARGET PRACTICE.

06:36.433 --> 06:39.639
GOOD POINT, HARRY.

06:40.039 --> 06:44.446
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER ONCE ASKED
ME HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT VIC.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.651
CAN'T TELL ME YOU WEREN'T
THE LEAST BIT CURIOUS.

06:47.651 --> 06:50.856
I ASSUMED IT WOULD
BE BETTER FOR BOTH OF US
IF I REMAINED IN THE DARK.

06:51.256 --> 06:54.061
SEE, I GOT THIS WAY OF
GETTING UNDER PEOPLE'S SKIN.

06:54.061 --> 06:59.670
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
TOUCH 'EM AND I SEE THINGS
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.673
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:01.673 --> 07:03.275
YOU KNOW, LIKE THINGS.

07:03.676 --> 07:06.079
LIKE HOW YOUR WIFE HAS STARTED
TO WEAR BLACK NEGLIGEES TO

07:06.079 --> 07:08.884
SPICE UP YOUR MARRIAGE WHILE
YOU CAT AROUND EVERY MONDAY

07:08.884 --> 07:12.488
NIGHT AFTER PHONING
THAT YOU'LL BE WORKING LATE.

07:12.488 --> 07:14.091
HOW IN THE WORLD
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

07:14.491 --> 07:16.094
CALM DOWN, HARRY.

07:16.094 --> 07:22.104
AND BY THE WAY, YOUR
WIFE HAS A HELL OF A FIGURE.

07:23.305 --> 07:24.107
GOT IT?

07:24.107 --> 07:25.709
YEAH.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.311
SO VIC HAS A BROTHER IN FLORIDA.

07:27.311 --> 07:29.314
YEAH, BUT VIC'S FAMILY'D
BE THE FIRST PLACE THAT

07:29.314 --> 07:30.917
RAYMOND'S MEN WOULD LOOK.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.519
VIC WOULD KNOW THAT.

07:32.519 --> 07:33.722
YEAH, WELL, WHERE
ELSE IS HE GOING TO GO?

07:33.722 --> 07:35.324
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T
HAVE A DIME TO HIS NAME.

07:35.725 --> 07:37.728
WELL, HE STOLE A WALLET FROM ONE
OF THE FBI GUYS AT THE SCENE.

07:37.728 --> 07:39.330
YEAH, JESSE, WHY DON'T
YOU CHECK THE CREDIT CARDS,

07:39.731 --> 07:41.333
SEE IF THERE'S
BEEN ANY ACTIVITY.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.737
YEAH. YEAH.

07:43.737 --> 07:48.143
ACCORDING TO THIS, HE ALREADY
TOOK OUT A $500 CASH ADVANCE

07:48.143 --> 07:53.351
AND HE RENTED A SPORTS
CAR FROM MIRAGE EXOTICS.

07:53.351 --> 07:55.354
HUH, WELL, ISN'T THAT SWEET?

07:55.354 --> 07:56.957
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

07:56.957 --> 07:58.559
YOU THINK HE'S
GOING TO RENT ECONOMY?

07:58.559 --> 08:00.162
YOU KNOW, WITH ANY LUCK,
THIS GUY'LL LEAVE A CREDIT CARD

08:00.162 --> 08:01.765
TRAIL, LEAD US RIGHT TO HIM.

08:01.765 --> 08:03.768
NAH, HE CAN'T BE THAT DUMB.

08:03.768 --> 08:08.174
87254224. WELL, THANKS.

08:08.174 --> 08:12.981
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A NATURAL BORN WRITER.

08:12.981 --> 08:14.985
THANKS.

08:19.391 --> 08:24.198
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER CLAUDIA
WOULD WELCOME ME BACK OR NOT.

08:24.198 --> 08:25.801
BUT ONE THING WAS FOR SURE...

08:26.201 --> 08:29.406
I HAD TO TRY.

08:29.406 --> 08:31.409
THERE'S AN HONOUR
AMONG THIEVES, YOU KNOW?

08:31.810 --> 08:33.412
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVER
ROLL OVER ON ANYONE, EVER.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.414
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THAT EQUATION.

08:35.817 --> 08:37.018
NO.

08:37.018 --> 08:38.220
ACTUALLY, THE OPPOSITE.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.823
I GOT BUSTED FOR A JOB
THAT A BUDDY OF MINE PULLED.

08:40.222 --> 08:41.424
WHAT?

08:41.424 --> 08:43.027
SO RATHER THAN FLIP ON
YOUR FRIEND, YOU DID THE TIME?

08:43.027 --> 08:44.629
WELL, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE FOR A CONVICTION,

08:44.629 --> 08:46.232
BUT I WOULD'VE.

08:46.232 --> 08:47.434
I FOUND VIC.

08:47.434 --> 08:48.635
WHERE IS HE?

08:49.037 --> 08:51.040
CHECKED HIMSELF INTO THE
TREELODGE HOTEL SPA FOR A LITTLE

08:51.040 --> 08:52.241
BIT OF A SPENDING SPREE.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.046
HE'S GOT BODY WRAPS,
MANICURE, SPA TREATMENT.

08:55.046 --> 08:56.648
WELL, I GUESS HE IS THAT DUMB.

08:56.648 --> 08:58.651
YEAH.

08:58.651 --> 09:01.455
OH, AND LOOKS LIKE HE SENT
A $200 FLOWER BASKET TO SOME

09:01.455 --> 09:03.458
WOMAN IN SHEREBORNE.

09:03.859 --> 09:05.862
SOUNDS LIKE OUR VIC REALLY
KNOWS HOW TO LIVE IT UP.

09:06.263 --> 09:07.064
YEP.

09:11.070 --> 09:12.272
HEY.

09:12.272 --> 09:13.474
ALL RIGHT, WE FOUND HIM.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.076
JUST TELL ME HE'S ALIVE.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.278
OH, YEAH, HE'S ALIVE ALL RIGHT.

09:16.278 --> 09:17.881
THANK GOD.

09:17.881 --> 09:21.086
WE TRACED HIM TO THE TREELODGE
HOTEL OUTSIDE FREEMONT.

09:21.086 --> 09:25.893
MY PEOPLE ARE ON
THEIR WAY TO PICK HIM UP.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.703
HEY, GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

09:33.104 --> 09:34.706
NOW.

09:35.107 --> 09:38.312
OR... I COULD INFORM THE WARDEN

09:38.312 --> 09:42.318
ABOUT YOUR EXTRACURRICULAR
NARCOTICS ACTIVITY.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.936
YEAH. IT'S ME.

09:53.936 --> 09:56.339
THEY'RE AT THE TREELODGE,
OUTSIDE OF FREEMONT.

09:56.339 --> 09:57.942
YEAH.

09:57.942 --> 10:00.746
THIS TIME, MAKE SURE
YOU TUCK HIM IN FOR GOOD.

10:04.351 --> 10:06.355
HOUSEKEEPING.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.957
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:07.957 --> 10:11.964
HOUSEKEEPING.

10:18.773 --> 10:20.376
WHAT...

10:24.782 --> 10:26.785
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING YOU'RE
NOT HERE TO TURN DOWN MY BED?

10:27.187 --> 10:28.388
I WONDER WHAT
GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

10:28.388 --> 10:29.590
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

10:29.590 --> 10:31.193
LET'S JUST NOBODY
GET NERVOUS, OKAY?

10:31.193 --> 10:32.795
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON THAT
SHOULD BE NERVOUS HERE, VIC.

10:32.795 --> 10:33.997
GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER.

10:33.997 --> 10:35.199
WE'VE BEEN ASSIGNED
TO PROTECT YOU.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.400
HA HA HA YEAH, RIGHT.

10:36.801 --> 10:38.404
WELL, LIKE THAT BANG-UP
JOB YOU DID THIS MORNING?

10:38.404 --> 10:40.407
IT'S A SHAME YOU WEREN'T
AROUND WHEN KENNEDY
WAS STILL PRESIDENT.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.410
YOUR PROTECTION?

10:42.410 --> 10:44.413
NO, THANKS. I WANT
OUT OF THIS. I WANT OUT NOW.

10:44.413 --> 10:46.416
YEAH, WELL, YOU
SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
BEFORE YOU MADE THE DEAL.

10:46.416 --> 10:47.617
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE NOW.

10:47.617 --> 10:48.819
SURE I DO.

10:49.220 --> 10:50.422
WHAT IF I DECIDE
I DON'T WANT TO TESTIFY?

10:50.422 --> 10:52.025
THEN YOU CAN GO TO PRISON.

10:52.025 --> 10:53.226
THEN GUESS WHO'S GOING
TO BE BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK?

10:53.226 --> 10:54.828
RAYMOND IS NEVER GOING DOWN.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.031
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

10:56.431 --> 10:58.034
BECAUSE NO ONE HAS
EVER LIVED TO SCREW HIM.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.636
OKAY, HE KNOWS THINGS.

10:59.636 --> 11:01.639
THINGS THERE'S NO WAY
ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH HE COULD

11:01.639 --> 11:02.840
POSSIBLY FIND OUT ABOUT.

11:03.242 --> 11:04.443
ALL RIGHT?

11:04.443 --> 11:06.046
HE'S LIKE THE
WIZARD OF FREAKIN' OZ.

11:06.046 --> 11:06.847
WELL, GUESS WHAT, TOTO?

11:07.248 --> 11:08.449
IT'S TIME TO TAKE
YOUR ASS BACK TO KANSAS.

11:08.449 --> 11:10.453
NOW, GET YOUR
STUFF AND LET'S GO.

11:10.453 --> 11:13.657
FINE. CAN I GET CHANGED FIRST?

11:13.657 --> 11:15.260
TWO MINUTES.

11:15.260 --> 11:17.663
THANKS.

11:19.666 --> 11:21.269
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:21.669 --> 11:22.871
I THINK HE'S SCARED.

11:23.272 --> 11:25.676
PROBABLY WISHES HE'D NEVER MADE
THIS DEAL IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:34.489 --> 11:36.492
VIC'S CHECKED INTO ROOM 112.

11:36.492 --> 11:38.896
LET'S JUST MAKE
IT LOOK LIKE SUICIDE.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.107
WE GOT COMPANY. THREE OF THEM.

11:46.508 --> 11:47.709
COME ON, VIC.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.312
BACK DOOR?
-YEAH.

11:49.312 --> 11:50.114
HERE. COME ON...

11:50.114 --> 11:51.315
YOU PERVERT.

11:51.715 --> 11:52.917
COME ON. WANT TO STAY HERE
AND VISIT RAYMOND'S FRIENDS?

11:52.917 --> 11:54.520
COME ON. COME ON.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.123
NOW WHAT?

12:00.529 --> 12:01.731
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS?

12:01.731 --> 12:02.932
YOUR ONLY WAY OUT.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.135
SORRY.

12:04.535 --> 12:06.138
PRETEND YOU NEVER SAW US, HUH?

12:06.138 --> 12:07.740
HELP!

12:07.740 --> 12:10.144
HELP!

12:12.948 --> 12:14.550
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

12:14.550 --> 12:15.352
GO.

12:15.352 --> 12:16.554
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

12:16.554 --> 12:18.557
GO!

12:23.364 --> 12:25.367
WHAT IS THAT?! WHAT IS THAT?!

12:25.367 --> 12:26.569
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

12:26.569 --> 12:27.770
HEY, I DON'T FLY.

12:27.770 --> 12:28.972
MOVE.

12:28.972 --> 12:30.175
I DON'T FLY! I DON'T FLY!

12:30.175 --> 12:32.578
I DON'T FLY!

12:34.581 --> 12:35.383
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

12:35.383 --> 12:36.584
GET HIM DOWN!

12:36.584 --> 12:39.389
GET DOWN!

12:42.193 --> 12:43.795
RIGHT, COME ON, LET'S GO!

12:44.196 --> 12:45.398
WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.000
HE MUST'VE KNOCKED
OUT THE CONTROLS.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.603
WELL, SWITCH TO MANUAL OVERRIDE.

12:48.603 --> 12:49.404
OKAY, HANG ON.

12:49.804 --> 12:50.606
COME ON!

12:50.606 --> 12:51.807
CAN WE GO?

12:51.807 --> 12:53.410
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:02.824 --> 13:04.427
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

13:04.427 --> 13:06.029
THE FLIGHT CONTROLS
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

13:06.029 --> 13:07.231
AW, MAN, THE
WHOLE SYSTEM'S FRIED.

13:07.231 --> 13:08.433
CAN YOU FIX IT?

13:08.433 --> 13:10.035
I DON'T KNOW. I'M WORKING ON IT.

13:10.035 --> 13:11.638
BUT I SURE WOULD
FEEL SAFER WORKING ON THIS
IF IT WASN'T IN THE AIR.

13:11.638 --> 13:13.241
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
DO SOMETHING FAST,

13:13.241 --> 13:14.442
YOU MAY JUST GET YOUR WISH.

13:14.442 --> 13:15.644
JUST TRY TO KEEP HER LEVEL.

13:16.044 --> 13:17.247
YEAH, WELL, IT'S
ALL YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

13:17.247 --> 13:18.849
THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT
PANEL IS OUT.

13:18.849 --> 13:22.053
WE'RE JUST FLYING
IN CIRCLES HERE.

13:30.066 --> 13:31.668
HOW DID RAYMOND'S MEN FIND US?

13:31.668 --> 13:34.072
I TOLD YOU, THE MAN
HAS EYES AND EARS EVERYWHERE.

13:34.072 --> 13:35.674
REALLY?

13:35.674 --> 13:37.678
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN
HOW'D YOU STAY ALIVE SO LONG?

13:37.678 --> 13:39.280
I'M JUST LUCKY, I GUESS.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.882
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

13:40.882 --> 13:42.885
BEING AROUND YOU IS HAVING
THE REVERSE EFFECT ON US.

13:44.888 --> 13:46.891
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I WANT OFF THE FLYING BUS.

13:46.891 --> 13:48.093
HEY, SIT!

13:48.093 --> 13:48.894
WHOA... WHOA... WHOA...

13:49.296 --> 13:50.096
I SAID SIT DOWN.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.299
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

13:51.699 --> 13:52.901
ARE YOU GOING
TO HIT ME YOU FREAK? HUH? HUH?

13:52.901 --> 13:54.503
THEN WHAT KIND
OF WITNESS DO I MAKE?

13:54.503 --> 13:56.105
I GOT THIS, JESSE.

13:56.105 --> 13:57.708
OH, WHAT ARE YOU - GOOD
COP/BAD COPPIN' ME, HERE?

13:57.708 --> 13:58.910
WELL, FORGET IT.

13:58.910 --> 14:00.913
ALL I KNOW IS,
I WANT OUT. ALL RIGHT?

14:00.913 --> 14:02.114
IF I'M GOING TO DIE,

14:02.114 --> 14:03.317
THEN I WANT TO DO IT
NICE AND PEACEFULLY, LIKE...

14:03.317 --> 14:04.919
LIKE WITH A BULLET TO THE HEAD.

14:04.919 --> 14:07.323
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRUST US.

14:07.323 --> 14:08.925
OKAY?

14:08.925 --> 14:10.928
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

14:10.928 --> 14:13.733
BUT I NEED YOU TO TAKE
A DEEP BREATH AND CALM DOWN.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.537
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:16.937 --> 14:18.940
WHOO.

14:20.543 --> 14:22.145
BETTER?

14:22.145 --> 14:24.148
YEAH. A LITTLE.

14:24.148 --> 14:25.751
GOOD.

14:28.956 --> 14:31.360
YOU GOT A
THING FOR ME, DON'T YOU?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.562
WHAT?

14:32.962 --> 14:34.163
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

14:34.163 --> 14:35.366
I NOTICED BACK AT THE HOTEL...

14:35.766 --> 14:36.968
WHAT?

14:37.369 --> 14:38.170
IT'S OKAY.

14:38.571 --> 14:39.772
IT'S...

14:39.772 --> 14:41.375
LOOK, I HAVE THAT EFFECT
ON A LOT OF WOMEN. ALL RIGHT?

14:41.776 --> 14:43.378
IT'S MY CROSS
TO BEAR, IT'S MY CURSE.

14:43.378 --> 14:44.980
I'M SORRY.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.182
I'M SORRY.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.586
THIS GUY IS SPOKEN FOR.

14:48.586 --> 14:50.989
WHAT? YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.992
DON'T LOOK SO SHOCKED, OKAY?

14:52.992 --> 14:54.595
THERE'S A LOT ABOUT
VIC YOU DON'T KNOW.

14:54.595 --> 14:55.797
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

14:56.197 --> 14:57.800
DOES VIC KNOW
HOW TO TAKE A SEAT?

14:57.800 --> 14:59.403
YEAH. FINE.

14:59.403 --> 15:00.604
EXCUSE ME, THOUGH.

15:00.604 --> 15:01.806
UH, MISS?

15:01.806 --> 15:03.809
YOU DON'T HAVE A BAG OF PEANUTS,
SOME PRETZELS, SOMETHING...

15:03.809 --> 15:05.011
A LITTLE...

15:23.440 --> 15:26.644
RAYMOND'S MEN WERE ON THE SCENE
MOMENTS AFTER MY TEAM ARRIVED.

15:26.644 --> 15:28.647
SO WHERE'D THE
LEAK COME FROM THIS TIME?

15:28.647 --> 15:31.051
ADAM, DON'T YOU THINK I'M
A LITTLE TOO PARANOID RIGHT NOW?

15:31.051 --> 15:33.455
I DIDN'T TELL A SOUL.

15:33.455 --> 15:34.657
ARE YOU SURE?

15:35.057 --> 15:37.060
AN ASSISTANT DA, OR A SECRETARY?

15:37.060 --> 15:38.663
YOUR WIFE?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.265
I TOLD NO ONE.

15:40.666 --> 15:42.268
NOW,
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW RAYMOND'S
BEEN ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH

15:42.268 --> 15:43.470
THE SYSTEM FOR SO LONG NOW.

15:43.870 --> 15:46.274
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS
IS VIC'S STILL ALIVE,

15:46.274 --> 15:47.877
BUT WE GOTTA BE CAREFUL.

15:47.877 --> 15:50.681
I THINK WE
SHOULD LIMIT OUR COMMUNICATIONS
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

15:50.681 --> 15:52.283
TRUST ME.

15:52.283 --> 15:53.886
AT THIS POINT,
THE WAY I SEE IT...

15:53.886 --> 15:55.489
IGNORANCE IS BLISS.

16:00.696 --> 16:02.298
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:02.298 --> 16:04.301
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,

16:04.301 --> 16:06.304
BUT I JUST GOT THE STRANGEST
FEELING FROM HIM RIGHT NOW?

16:06.706 --> 16:07.907
WHAT?

16:07.907 --> 16:09.910
I DON'T KNOW. IT
WAS LIKE BEING ON A...

16:09.910 --> 16:13.115
A PHONE CALL AND
SOMEONE ELSE PICKS UP THE
OTHER LINE AND LISTENS IN.

16:13.516 --> 16:19.124
DO YOU THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT HE'S A MUTANT
WITH PSIONIC ABILITIES?

16:19.124 --> 16:21.127
I DON'T KNOW.

16:21.528 --> 16:23.130
ALL I KNOW IS I GOT
THIS REALLY CREEPY FEELING

16:23.130 --> 16:26.736
LIKE I WAS BEING WATCHED.

16:26.736 --> 16:30.341
I THINK MAYBE WE
SHOULD CHECK OUT RAYMOND.

16:30.341 --> 16:33.547
FACE TO FACE.

16:38.755 --> 16:39.956
JESSE, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

16:39.956 --> 16:41.158
I'M ON IT.

16:45.164 --> 16:47.167
CHAPTER EIGHT.

16:47.167 --> 16:50.773
I CALL THIS "UNCERTAINTY",
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH EVERY FIBRE

16:50.773 --> 16:55.580
IN MY BEING TELLS ME I'M GOING
TO DIE, I REFUSE TO GIVE UP.

16:55.580 --> 16:56.381
DO YOU MIND?

16:56.782 --> 16:57.984
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK HERE.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.587
YEAH? WELL, SO AM I, OKAY?

16:59.587 --> 17:01.188
THESE ARE NOTES FOR
A BOOK I'M PLANNING ON WRITING

17:01.188 --> 17:02.390
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER.

17:02.390 --> 17:03.993
PROVIDED I'M STILL
ALIVE TO WRITE IT.

17:10.402 --> 17:13.207
WHAT DID YOU
DO FOR RAYMOND, ANYWAY?

17:13.207 --> 17:16.011
I... I WAS IN CHARGE OF
SETTING UP DUMMY CORPORATIONS

17:16.011 --> 17:18.013
FOR HIM TO LAUNDER HIS MONEY.

17:18.013 --> 17:20.017
SO HOW'D THINGS
GO SOUR BETWEEN YOU TOO?

17:20.017 --> 17:22.020
WELL, ONE DAY
I TOLD HIM I WANTED OUT;

17:22.020 --> 17:23.623
THE NEXT DAY HE
TOOK A HIT OUT ON ME.

17:23.623 --> 17:25.224
FROM THEN ON,
I KNEW I WAS COOKED.

17:25.224 --> 17:26.828
NO MATTER WHAT I DID, I WAS A...

17:26.828 --> 17:28.430
I WAS A DEAD MAN.

17:28.430 --> 17:30.433
WHY'D YOU WANT OUT SO BAD?

17:30.433 --> 17:34.439
I FELL IN LOVE WITH A
WOMAN WHO TURNED MY LIFE AROUND.

17:34.439 --> 17:40.048
HER... HER NAME'S CLAUDIA.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.865
ALL RIGHT. SAY VIC DOES TESTIFY.

17:50.865 --> 17:53.268
HOW MUCH DAMAGE CONTROL
ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO?

17:53.268 --> 17:54.871
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SAM.

17:54.871 --> 17:56.874
I THOUGH YOU HAD
THAT PROBLEM UNDER CONTROL?

17:56.874 --> 17:59.678
I HAD A TEMPORARY SETBACK.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.082
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
ALL MY OPTIONS ARE COVERED.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.886
IF VIC TAKES THE
STAND HE'LL CRUCIFY YOU.

18:05.286 --> 18:07.289
OF COURSE, I'LL DO WHAT
I CAN TO ATTACK HIS CREDIBILITY.

18:07.691 --> 18:11.697
BUT FACE IT: HE KNOWS
WHERE ALL THE BODIES ARE BURIED.

18:11.697 --> 18:13.700
WELL, THEN WE
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

18:14.100 --> 18:16.103
I CAN'T PREVENT
HIM FROM TAKING THE STAND.

18:16.103 --> 18:17.706
IF I CAN'T FIND VIC,

18:17.706 --> 18:20.109
I HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO MEANS SOMETHING TO HIM.

18:20.109 --> 18:22.914
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

18:29.724 --> 18:30.926
HELLO?

18:30.926 --> 18:32.929
HELLO. MARTIN, IT'S ME.

18:32.929 --> 18:35.332
HAVE YOU LOOKED
AROUND VIC'S HOTEL ROOM?

18:35.332 --> 18:36.534
NOTHING SO FAR.

18:36.935 --> 18:38.137
DO ME A FAVOUR.

18:38.137 --> 18:41.341
GIVE IT ANOTHER ONCE
OVER WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE.

18:50.957 --> 18:54.561
NO...
-WHAT?

18:54.561 --> 18:56.164
SEE THAT PHOTOGRAPH
BY THE EDGE OF THE BED?

18:56.565 --> 18:57.366
PICK IT UP.

18:57.366 --> 18:59.369
BOSS, YOU'RE FREAKIN' ME OUT.

18:59.369 --> 19:02.574
JUST DO IT.

19:11.387 --> 19:13.792
THAT MUST BE HIS GIRLFRIEND.

19:14.192 --> 19:18.598
CHECK THE HOTEL PHONE
RECORDS AND FIND HER.

19:18.598 --> 19:21.002
YOU GOT IT.

19:30.216 --> 19:31.819
SEE, CLAUDIA...

19:31.819 --> 19:34.623
SHE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE CARS
AND THE MONEY OR THE LIFESTYLE.

19:35.024 --> 19:37.427
ALL SHE REALLY
CARED ABOUT WAS ME.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.030
IT... IT...

19:39.430 --> 19:41.835
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
KIND OF LIKE THE GODFATHER
III, ONLY IN REVERSE.

19:42.235 --> 19:45.841
INSTEAD OF PULLING ME BACK IN,
SHE... SHE WAS PULLING ME OUT.

19:45.841 --> 19:48.244
SHE SOUNDS PRETTY SPECIAL.

19:48.644 --> 19:49.847
YEAH.

19:50.247 --> 19:52.250
IN THE MOVIE, I SEE
HER PLAYED BY JULIA ROBERTS.

19:52.650 --> 19:56.256
IF... IF IT'S A TV
MOVIE, A JUSTINE BATEMAN.

19:56.256 --> 19:57.859
OKAY.

19:57.859 --> 20:01.464
YEAH, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE GOT HERE, HUH?

20:02.666 --> 20:07.073
OKAY... NICE WORK.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.278
SO WHERE ARE WE?
-WHERE ARE WE?

20:10.678 --> 20:13.884
WE ARE... RIGHT
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

20:13.884 --> 20:16.687
OH, MAN.
YOU GUYS ARE GOOD.

20:19.893 --> 20:21.495
WHAT?
I... I WAS BEING SERIOUS.

20:21.495 --> 20:23.899
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

20:24.299 --> 20:27.504
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT?!

20:29.107 --> 20:30.708
OKAY, WHEN THAT BULLET
FRIED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT

20:30.708 --> 20:32.711
MUST'VE SHEARED
A HYDRAULIC LINE.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.715
YOU COULDN'T
FIGURE THAT OUT WHEN WE
WERE STILL ON THE GROUND?

20:34.715 --> 20:35.917
HEY, RELAX.

20:36.317 --> 20:37.519
WE'RE GOING TO
BE BLEEDING FLUID OUT.

20:37.519 --> 20:39.122
I TOLD YOU, IT WAS ALL
I COULD DO TO KEEP HER STEADY.

20:43.528 --> 20:44.730
PULL UP!

20:44.730 --> 20:47.134
I'M TRYING. THE
CONTROLS ARE FROZEN.

20:47.134 --> 20:48.736
WE GOTTA LAND IT NOW.

20:48.736 --> 20:50.339
LAND IT? JESSE, I
CAN'T EVEN KEEP HER LEVEL.

20:50.339 --> 20:53.945
WE'RE GOING TO CRASH, AREN'T WE?

20:57.951 --> 20:59.954
THIS IS THE PART WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REASSURE ME.

21:01.957 --> 21:03.960
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING!

21:08.968 --> 21:10.570
IT'S STILL FROZEN.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.172
WE'RE AT LESS
THAN TWO THOUSAND FEET.

21:12.172 --> 21:13.374
ANY IDEAS?

21:13.374 --> 21:14.977
UH, YES.

21:15.377 --> 21:17.380
MAYBE IF WE TRIED JUICING ONE
OF THE HYDRAULIC LINES WITH AN

21:17.380 --> 21:19.383
ELECTRICAL ARC, IT MIGHT HEAT
UP THE FLUID ENOUGH TO GIVE US

21:19.383 --> 21:21.386
THE PRESSURE WE NEED,
BUT I DON'T KNOW, BRENNAN.

21:21.386 --> 21:23.389
TAKE THE CONTROLS.

21:23.389 --> 21:25.392
ALL RIGHT.

21:26.194 --> 21:28.197
WHAT IS THAT?

21:29.399 --> 21:31.402
IT'S WORKING, BRENNAN.

21:32.603 --> 21:34.606
WE'VE LEVELLED OFF,
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET.

21:34.606 --> 21:36.209
NICE.

21:36.209 --> 21:38.212
GUYS, THERE'S
A SCHOOLYARD BELOW US.

21:38.212 --> 21:39.814
OKAY, I'M TAKING HER DOWN.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.017
OH, NO.

21:41.417 --> 21:42.619
NO, NO, NO. THIS
IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

21:42.619 --> 21:43.820
I DO NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.423
HEY, HEY! TAKE A SEAT!

21:45.423 --> 21:46.224
NO, NO. FORGET THAT. ALL
RIGHT? I'D RATHER GROW WINGS.

21:46.625 --> 21:47.826
WOULD YOU CALM DOWN?!

21:47.826 --> 21:49.029
I CAN'T!

21:51.032 --> 21:52.234
THANK YOU.

21:52.634 --> 21:53.835
HIT HIM AGAIN.

21:53.835 --> 21:57.041
I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL BE NECESSARY.

22:10.661 --> 22:12.264
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, HUH?

22:12.264 --> 22:16.270
OH, YEAH. LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

22:16.270 --> 22:19.875
OH... DID YOU HIT ME?

22:25.484 --> 22:27.087
THE DAY WAS GROWING
WORSE BY THE MINUTE.

22:27.487 --> 22:29.891
FIRST, DIVERTING A
NEAR AIR DISASTER, SECOND,

22:29.891 --> 22:33.096
THE HUMILITY OF BEING KNOCKED
OUT BY A BEAUTIFUL CHICK.

22:33.096 --> 22:35.500
I... I DON'T
KNOW WHICH WAS WORSE.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.503
I... OKAY, WHOA.

22:37.503 --> 22:39.506
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PACK
ONE HELL OF A PUNCH IF YOU'RE

22:39.506 --> 22:40.707
GOING TO GET ME
BACK IN THAT SARDINE CAN.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.310
WOULD YOU RELAX?

22:42.310 --> 22:43.912
OKAY, BRENNAN'S WORKING
ON SOME ALTERNATE MODE OF

22:43.912 --> 22:45.515
TRANSPORTATION FOR US, OKAY?

22:45.515 --> 22:46.316
YEAH.

22:46.717 --> 22:48.319
THERE'S AN IDEA.

22:59.937 --> 23:02.741
AW, GEEZ, YOU...

23:02.741 --> 23:04.344
YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING
A LITTLE LESS SPORTY?

23:04.744 --> 23:06.347
JUST GET IN.

23:06.347 --> 23:08.750
OKAY, I'M GOING.

23:09.552 --> 23:11.154
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

23:11.154 --> 23:12.756
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT.

23:12.756 --> 23:14.359
I FOUND THE PUNCTURED HYDRAULICS
LINE, AND I CAN FIX IT.

23:14.759 --> 23:16.762
BUT IT'S GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME.

23:16.762 --> 23:21.570
HEY, YOU COULD ALWAYS USE YOUR
CUSHION AS A FLOTATION DEVICE.

23:21.570 --> 23:24.775
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.390
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY'VE AGREED TO IT.

23:34.390 --> 23:36.393
RAYMOND'S PREPARED
TO MEET WITH YOU BOTH.

23:36.393 --> 23:39.197
HE... HE THINKS
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING HIM
FOR A STORY FOR THE TIMES.

23:39.598 --> 23:42.001
AND HIS LAWYER DIDN'T
BALK AT THIS REQUEST?

23:42.001 --> 23:43.604
QUITE THE CONTRARY.

23:44.004 --> 23:46.408
HE INSISTED ON MEETING
WITH YOU BOTH ALONE.

23:46.408 --> 23:48.010
WELL, HE MUST BE
PRETTY SURE OF HIMSELF.

23:48.411 --> 23:50.013
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.417
IT'S LIKE HE'S PLAYING WITH US.

23:52.417 --> 23:57.625
WELL, MAYBE NOW'S OUR
CHANCE TO GET THE UPPER HAND.

24:09.643 --> 24:12.047
THANKS FOR AGREEING
TO MEET WITH US.

24:12.047 --> 24:13.650
WE JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.053
OF COURSE.

24:16.053 --> 24:20.059
IT'S A THRILL, ADAM.
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.466
HELLO, EMMA. YOU'RE
EVEN PRETTIER IN PERSON.

24:24.466 --> 24:26.068
HOW DO YOU KNOW OUR NAMES?

24:26.068 --> 24:30.074
OH, I KNOW LOTS OF THINGS,
ADAM. YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

24:30.074 --> 24:34.080
TELL ME, HAVE I SAID ENOUGH FOR
YOU TO GET THE... UPPER HAND?

24:34.080 --> 24:39.289
OKAY. COME ON. LET'S GO.

24:39.289 --> 24:41.292
WELL, AT LEAST
SHAKE MY HAND, ADAM.

24:41.292 --> 24:43.295
I MEAN, YOU'RE
NOT SCARED, ARE YOU?

24:43.295 --> 24:46.500
DON'T LET HIM TOUCH YOU.

24:48.503 --> 24:50.906
YOU TELL SILVERMAN HE'S
NEVER GOING TO GET A CONVICTION

24:50.906 --> 24:54.111
BECAUSE VIC IS
NEVER GOING TO TESTIFY.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.732
I'M FEELING
A LITTLE HUNGRY, HUH?

25:08.132 --> 25:10.136
WHY DON'T WE GET SOMETHING
TO EAT IN THE NEXT TOWN OVER?

25:10.136 --> 25:12.139
SORRY, VIC.
WE GOTTA KEEP MOVING.

25:12.139 --> 25:14.142
COME ON, GUYS. I'M BUYING.

25:14.142 --> 25:16.145
I KNOW THIS GREAT PIZZA PLACE
THAT'S JUST OVER IN SHEREBORNE.

25:16.145 --> 25:17.748
IT'S GREAT.

25:17.748 --> 25:19.350
OH, YEAH?

25:19.350 --> 25:20.952
I KNOW THIS GUY WHO
SENT A HUGE FLOWER ARRANGEMENT

25:20.952 --> 25:24.157
TO SOME GIRL IN SHEREBORNE.

25:24.157 --> 25:25.760
I THINK IN THE,
UH, MOVIE VERSION SHE'S
PLAYED BY JULIA ROBERTS.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.763
OKAY, OKAY. OKAY,
OKAY, YOU CAUGHT ME.

25:27.763 --> 25:29.766
ALL RIGHT? THAT'S...
THAT'S WHERE CLAUDIA LIVES.

25:29.766 --> 25:31.769
THAT'S WHERE I WAS
HEADING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:31.769 --> 25:32.971
WHY'D YOU WAIT
'TIL NOW TO TELL US?

25:33.372 --> 25:34.573
I DON'T KNOW.

25:34.573 --> 25:36.577
I FIGURED MAYBE WE
COULD BOND ON THE WAY OVER.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.178
NO, YOU FIGURED WRONG.

25:38.178 --> 25:39.781
AW, GIVE ME A
BREAK, WOULD YOU, PAL?

25:40.181 --> 25:41.784
I HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD
FROM CLAUDIA SINCE I'VE BEEN

25:41.784 --> 25:44.188
IN WITNESS RELOCATION.

25:44.188 --> 25:45.790
YOU NEVER TOLD
HER WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

25:45.790 --> 25:47.393
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

25:47.393 --> 25:48.595
AND AS FAR AS SHE'S CONCERNED,

25:48.995 --> 25:51.399
I FELL OFF THE
FACE OF THE EARTH.

25:51.399 --> 25:54.604
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT BUYING THIS.

25:54.604 --> 25:56.607
I'M ON THE LEVEL HERE.

25:56.607 --> 25:58.610
WELL, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TRY TO CALL HER?

25:58.610 --> 26:00.613
LOOK, I... I COULD
GIVE YOU A LINE, RIGHT?

26:01.013 --> 26:02.616
LIKE... LIKE, I WAS
JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HER.

26:02.616 --> 26:07.023
BUT, TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,
I... I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

26:07.023 --> 26:10.227
LOOK, YOU GUYS... YOU
DON'T OWE ME SQUAT, OKAY?

26:10.629 --> 26:11.830
I KNOW THAT.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.433
BUT... YOU KNOW, I WOULD...

26:13.433 --> 26:15.836
I WOULD GIVE MY RIGHT ARM
FOR JUST FIVE MINUTES WITH HER,

26:15.836 --> 26:18.641
SO I COULD...
SO I COULD SAY GOOD BYE.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.644
I MEAN, SHE DESERVES THAT MUCH.

26:21.044 --> 26:23.448
WE DON'T HAVE
TIME TO STOP SO YOU CAN
MAKE SOME LOVE CONNECTION.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.252
BRENNAN...

26:26.252 --> 26:30.258
WHAT?

26:31.861 --> 26:33.864
FINE. FIVE MINUTES.

26:33.864 --> 26:37.069
HEY, THANKS, PAL.

26:37.069 --> 26:39.473
LOOK, I'M SORRY, DRIVER.

26:45.081 --> 26:48.286
SO, RAYMOND'S BEEN GETTING
HIS INFORMATION FIRST HAND.

26:48.687 --> 26:51.090
HE'S A POWERFUL PSIONIC,
AND HE RECOGNIZED US FROM OUR

26:51.090 --> 26:52.693
CONTACT WITH SILVERMAN.

26:52.693 --> 26:54.295
YEAH.

26:54.295 --> 26:55.898
I MEAN, HE MUST HAVE THE ABILITY
TO GET INSIDE SILVERMAN'S HEAD.

26:56.298 --> 26:58.702
AND TO LITERALLY SEE
AND HEAR EVERYTHING HE DOES.

26:58.702 --> 27:01.907
WHICH EXPLAINS
HOW HE'S MANAGED TO SKATE OFF
EVERY TIME HE'S BEEN TRIED.

27:01.907 --> 27:04.711
YEAH, BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO USE THIS ABILITY AGAINST HIM.

27:04.711 --> 27:06.313
HOW?

27:09.118 --> 27:10.319
YOU MISSED ME.

27:10.319 --> 27:11.922
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, VIC?

27:11.922 --> 27:14.325
A HUNDRED DOLLAR FLOWER
ARRANGEMENT WAS GOING
TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER?

27:14.325 --> 27:16.328
WHOA... I SPENT TWO.

27:16.730 --> 27:17.931
YEAH.

27:18.331 --> 27:20.335
AND I SPENT THE LAST
YEAR WONDERING WHERE YOU WERE,

27:20.335 --> 27:21.937
OR IF I'D EVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

27:21.937 --> 27:23.940
I... YOU KNOW, I... I...

27:24.341 --> 27:26.344
WHAT...

27:26.344 --> 27:30.751
LET ME EXPLAIN, HON.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.154
HEY. BABE.

27:35.959 --> 27:37.962
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM
WIGGLE OUT OF THIS ONE.

27:38.362 --> 27:41.167
YEAH. I THINK HE STANDS A
BETTER CHANCE WITH RAYMOND.

27:41.167 --> 27:43.170
BRENNAN, SHALIMAR?

27:43.170 --> 27:44.371
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

27:44.371 --> 27:45.974
JESSE'S TRACKED
YOUR COMLINK SIGNAL.

27:45.974 --> 27:47.577
HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE
HELIX UP AND RUNNING.

27:47.577 --> 27:48.779
HE'S COMING TO PICK YOU UP.

27:49.179 --> 27:49.980
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:50.380 --> 27:51.583
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
RAYMOND'S PEOPLE A CHANCE

27:51.983 --> 27:53.185
TO CATCH UP WITH YOU AGAIN.

27:53.586 --> 27:56.791
THE SOONER YOU'RE SAFE BACK
HERE AT SANCTUARY THE BETTER.

27:56.791 --> 28:01.197
WELL, LET'S GET MR.LONELY HEARTS
CLUB READY TO ROLL.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.601
AT LEAST IT SOUNDS
QUIETER IN THERE.

28:04.002 --> 28:05.604
YEAH, A LITTLE TOO QUIET.

28:05.604 --> 28:07.608
VIC, LET'S GO.

28:08.008 --> 28:10.411
VIC...

28:21.629 --> 28:23.632
DAMN.

28:30.576 --> 28:31.777
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T
FIGURED THAT OUT YET.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.380
JUST GIVE...
GIVE ME SOME TIME, HUH?

28:33.380 --> 28:34.582
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?

28:34.582 --> 28:36.184
LOOK, I NEVER SAID I
HAD ALL THE ANSWERS, CLAUDIA.

28:36.184 --> 28:37.787
I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY ONE
STEP AHEAD OF THE CURVE HERE.

28:38.187 --> 28:38.988
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TESTIFY...

28:39.389 --> 28:40.190
I CAN'T.

28:40.190 --> 28:41.392
...AND GET THIS OVER WITH.

28:41.793 --> 28:42.994
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

28:42.994 --> 28:44.196
LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER.

28:44.196 --> 28:45.399
DON'T YOU GET IT?

28:45.399 --> 28:47.000
I MEAN, IF I TESTIFY,
THEN MY LIFE IS OVER, RIGHT?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.603
WHAT?

28:49.003 --> 28:53.010
I'M SORRY, VIC.
THIS IS AS FAR AS I GO.

28:53.010 --> 28:54.612
WHAT'S THIS?

28:54.612 --> 28:56.214
LOOK, LIKE I TOLD
YOU FROM THE START -

28:56.214 --> 28:57.817
I CAN'T LIVE MY LIFE LIKE THIS.

28:57.817 --> 28:59.820
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DON'T DO THIS.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.022
OKAY?

29:01.022 --> 29:02.223
I... I'M TRYING TO GET OUT.

29:02.223 --> 29:03.826
BUT THE TRUTH IS, YOU CAN'T.

29:03.826 --> 29:06.631
VIC... I LOVE YOU.

29:07.031 --> 29:11.839
AND... IF YOU EVEN CARED
ABOUT ME, YOU'D LET ME GO.

29:12.239 --> 29:14.242
RIGHT.

29:14.242 --> 29:17.848
YOU'RE...

29:17.848 --> 29:19.451
UH, OKAY, THEN.

29:19.451 --> 29:21.854
THIS IS A LOAN, RIGHT? OKAY?

29:21.854 --> 29:25.059
I LOVE YOU. I... I...

29:25.059 --> 29:26.661
BYE, VIC.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.272
YOU KNOW, I KNEW I SHOULD
HAVE NEVER LET MY GUARD DOWN.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.475
VIC WAS JUST WAITING TO PLAY US.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.077
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

29:37.478 --> 29:39.080
WELL, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GOING TO TRY AND DEFEND HIM.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.083
LOOK, HONEY, I THINK IF YOU HAD
A ROMANTIC BONE IN YOUR BODY YOU

29:41.083 --> 29:43.086
MIGHT SEE THAT HE
TOOK OFF AFTER HER BECAUSE
HE REALLY LOVES HER.

29:43.086 --> 29:44.288
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:44.288 --> 29:46.291
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE
A ROMANTIC BONE IN MY BODY.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.294
YOU GO THAT WAY.

29:48.695 --> 29:51.098
I'M GOING TO GO THIS WAY.

30:34.364 --> 30:36.367
GET IN!

30:44.781 --> 30:47.184
COME ON! COME ON!

31:02.007 --> 31:05.212
WELL, THE JUDGE HAS DENIED
MY REQUEST FOR A CONTINUANCE.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.815
NOT A PROBLEM.

31:06.815 --> 31:09.218
THE SITUATION IS
UNDER CONTROL. VIC IS SAFE.

31:09.218 --> 31:11.622
WHEN DID HE ARRIVE?

31:11.622 --> 31:14.025
WELL, MY PEOPLE JUST BROUGHT
HIM TO A SECURE LOCATION.

31:14.426 --> 31:15.628
HE'S READY TO TESTIFY.

31:15.628 --> 31:19.233
WE ARE BACK ON SCHEDULE.

31:26.044 --> 31:28.848
YOU GUYS WANT TO KNOW WHY I RAN.

31:28.848 --> 31:30.450
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHY YOU RAN --
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SELFISH

31:30.450 --> 31:32.854
PATHETIC LITTLE MAN
WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF.

31:32.854 --> 31:35.659
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

31:35.659 --> 31:37.662
THE WHOLE TIME
YOU WERE RUNNING YOU WERE
ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT US.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.264
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I TOOK OFF, OKAY?

31:39.264 --> 31:42.068
HUH, I THOUGHT MAYBE IF CLAUDIA
AND I COULD GET FAR ENOUGH

31:42.068 --> 31:44.873
AWAY, THEY'D JUST GIVE UP ON US.

31:44.873 --> 31:46.475
YEAH, AND THEN
RAYMOND GOES FREE.

31:46.876 --> 31:48.879
LOOK, I NEVER SIGNED
UP FOR THIS HERO THING.

31:48.879 --> 31:50.481
OKAY? IT'S NOT WHO I AM.

31:50.882 --> 31:54.087
WELL, THANKS FOR SHATTERING
THAT IMAGE FOR ME.

31:58.894 --> 32:00.496
HELLO?

32:00.897 --> 32:02.099
HEY, VIC.

32:02.099 --> 32:04.903
YOU KNOW, I FINALLY FIGURED
OUT WHY YOU WANTED OUT SO BADLY.

32:04.903 --> 32:07.307
THAT BLONDE BOMBSHELL OF YOURS.

32:07.307 --> 32:10.111
HOO, WHAT A DISH.

32:10.111 --> 32:14.517
YOU KNOW, IT'D BE A SHAME IF
ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER.

32:14.517 --> 32:18.524
BUT, I'M A GENEROUS MAN,
SO I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

32:18.524 --> 32:22.129
YOUR LIFE FOR HERS.

32:22.129 --> 32:24.934
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.

32:24.934 --> 32:27.738
YOU HAVE 'TIL
9:00 A.M. TO DECIDE.

32:31.343 --> 32:36.952
WHA... THAT WAS
UH... THAT WAS RAYMOND.

32:37.353 --> 32:41.359
THEY GOT CLAUDIA.

32:41.760 --> 32:47.368
HE SAYS I HAVE UNTIL 9:00 A.M.
TOMORROW TO TURN MYSELF IN,

32:47.368 --> 32:51.775
OR ELSE THEY'RE
GOING TO KILL HER.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.588
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HER.

33:04.828 --> 33:07.633
IF SHE DIES, IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

33:07.633 --> 33:09.636
LOOK, VIC, YOU
HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING.

33:09.636 --> 33:11.639
YEAH.

33:11.639 --> 33:13.241
BUT WHO... WHO'S
THE ONE GOING AROUND SAYING
RAYMOND IS ALL-POWERFUL, HUH?

33:13.241 --> 33:15.645
JUST BY
GOING THERE I PRACTICALLY
HANDED CLAUDIA OVER TO

33:15.645 --> 33:17.247
RAYMOND MYSELF.

33:17.648 --> 33:18.449
SORRY.

33:18.849 --> 33:20.452
I SCREWED UP MY WHOLE LIFE.

33:20.452 --> 33:21.654
MAYBE IT'S FINALLY TIME I...

33:22.054 --> 33:23.657
I DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

33:23.657 --> 33:25.259
WELL,
YOU CAN'T JUST TURN YOURSELF
OVER TO RAYMOND'S PEOPLE?

33:25.259 --> 33:26.862
OH, YEAH? WATCH ME.

33:26.862 --> 33:28.465
HE'S JUST GOING
TO KILL YOU BOTH.

33:28.465 --> 33:29.666
SHE'S RIGHT.

33:29.666 --> 33:31.268
RAYMOND'S NOT GOING
TO LEAVE ANY LOOSE ENDS.

33:31.669 --> 33:33.672
YEAH? WELL, I... I HAVE TO TRY.

33:33.672 --> 33:35.675
WELL, FINE. THEN TWO
MORE LIVES WILL BE LOST.

33:35.675 --> 33:38.079
I'M OUT OF OPTIONS HERE, PAL.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.682
MAYBE NOT.

33:39.682 --> 33:43.688
ADAM, WHAT IF WE WERE TO SHADOW
VIC, AND GET CLAUDIA BACK FIRST.

33:44.088 --> 33:46.492
AND THEN HAND VIC
OVER TO THE DA AFTERWARDS.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.895
NO. BECAUSE THE JUDGE REFUSED
TO GRANT ANY MORE CONTINUANCES.

33:48.895 --> 33:50.898
AFTER TOMORROW, RAYMOND WALKS.

33:51.299 --> 33:53.703
ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS, CHAMP?

33:53.703 --> 33:54.905
HEY, WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.

33:55.305 --> 33:56.106
YOU'RE HELPING ME OUT?

33:56.106 --> 33:57.308
GUYS.

33:57.709 --> 33:59.311
MY GIRLFRIEND--
HEY, NO, GUYS. WAIT.

33:59.712 --> 34:02.917
MAYBE THE ANSWER
HERE IS TO HAVE VIC IN BOTH
PLACES AT THE SAME TIME.

34:03.317 --> 34:04.520
OKAY, HEY... WHOA.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.923
I... I GET THAT YOU PEOPLE
ARE A LITTLE "SPECIAL", OKAY?

34:06.923 --> 34:08.125
BUT, COME ON...

34:08.125 --> 34:09.326
NO, LISTEN.

34:09.326 --> 34:10.929
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
A WAY TO WORK THIS OUT.

34:10.929 --> 34:12.130
JESSE, I'M GOING
TO NEED YOUR HELP.

34:12.532 --> 34:13.734
WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO WORK FAST.

34:13.734 --> 34:14.935
SO WHAT... WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

34:15.335 --> 34:16.938
ARE YOU... ARE YOU
GOING TO SPLIT ME IN TWO?

34:17.338 --> 34:19.743
YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

34:26.152 --> 34:27.353
NOW, THIS ISN'T GOING TO HURT.

34:27.755 --> 34:29.357
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED
YOU TO STAY VERY STILL.

34:29.357 --> 34:30.158
SURE.

34:30.559 --> 34:32.963
I... I... I CAN DO THAT.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.602
TO BE OR NOT TO BE.

34:58.602 --> 34:59.804
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

35:00.204 --> 35:01.807
WHETHER IT IS NOBLER IN THE
MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND

35:02.207 --> 35:04.210
ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE...

35:04.210 --> 35:05.813
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

35:05.813 --> 35:07.015
YOU GOT HIM QUOTING SHAKESPEARE?

35:07.415 --> 35:09.418
WELL, I HAD
TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING.

35:09.418 --> 35:12.624
THE COMPUTER NEEDS
ENOUGH SOURCE MATERIAL TO
ASSIMILATE A VOCAL PATTERN.

35:12.624 --> 35:14.226
AND YOU THINK HE'S GOING
TO BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF?

35:14.627 --> 35:17.430
MAYBE THAT IS THE QUESTION.

35:17.430 --> 35:20.235
FRIENDS, ROMANS, COUNTRYMEN,
GIVE ME YOUR EARS.

35:34.657 --> 35:36.259
HEY, VIC'S ON HIS WAY UP.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.262
IS HE ALONE?
-YEAH.

35:38.664 --> 35:42.268
GOOD. DO 'EM BOTH.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.679
YOU CERTAINLY LOOK CHIPPER.

35:48.679 --> 35:49.881
IMPENDING FREEDOM, HARRY.

35:50.281 --> 35:53.085
ALWAYS PUTS A LITTLE
BOUNCE IN MY STEP.

35:57.091 --> 35:59.896
IT'S ME. OPEN UP.

36:10.311 --> 36:11.914
YOU OKAY?

36:11.914 --> 36:13.116
HEY, VIC.

36:13.116 --> 36:14.719
SHAME THIS ALL COULD'VE BEEN
AVOIDED IF YOU JUST TOOK THE

36:14.719 --> 36:16.722
BULLET WHEN
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO.

36:16.722 --> 36:18.725
YEAH, WELL. I'M HERE NOW, RIGHT?

36:18.725 --> 36:21.128
SO... WHY DON'T YOU LET HER GO?

36:21.128 --> 36:24.333
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, DID YOU?

36:24.333 --> 36:25.936
REALLY?

36:25.936 --> 36:27.137
COME ON, GUYS.

36:27.537 --> 36:32.345
AT LEAST... AT LEAST LET ME HAVE
A... A GOOD BYE KISS.

36:43.963 --> 36:45.565
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

36:45.966 --> 36:47.969
OKAY.

36:53.577 --> 36:55.982
COME ON, VIC. TIME'S UP.

36:59.186 --> 37:01.189
NEAT TRICK, HUH?

37:04.394 --> 37:05.997
GET THE GIRL.

37:18.015 --> 37:18.817
HA...

37:18.817 --> 37:20.018
YOU OKAY?

37:20.018 --> 37:21.220
YOU KIDDIN', HOT STUFF?

37:21.220 --> 37:22.823
IT WAS A CAKE-WALK.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.226
YOU CAN STOP THAT NOW.

37:34.841 --> 37:36.844
HEY, SILVERMAN. WHY SO GLUM?

37:36.844 --> 37:40.449
YOU KNOW, IT JUST GOES
TO SHOW YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL.

37:40.850 --> 37:42.052
OH, TODAY HE CAN.

37:42.452 --> 37:45.657
HEY, RAY. NICE
DAY FOR A TRIAL, HUH?

37:46.058 --> 37:50.464
YOU SON OF A--

38:07.691 --> 38:09.293
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

38:09.293 --> 38:10.896
WHY ARE WE HERE, HUH?
WHERE'S CLAUDIA?

38:10.896 --> 38:12.899
YOU TOLD ME SHE WOULD BE SAFE.

38:12.899 --> 38:14.101
SHE IS.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.905
BUT I'M AFRAID SHE SAID SHE
NEVER WANTS TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

38:16.905 --> 38:19.309
YEAH?

38:19.309 --> 38:22.915
WELL, I CAN'T
SAY I REALLY BLAME HER.

38:22.915 --> 38:26.520
UNTIL WE TWISTED
HER ARM AND CONVINCED HER
TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.

38:26.921 --> 38:28.924
JUST TELL ME
IT'S REALLY OVER, VIC.

38:28.924 --> 38:32.129
IT'S DONE. IT'S ALL DONE.

38:34.132 --> 38:35.733
AW, HE DID A GREAT JOB.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.339
IT TOOK THE JURY
LESS THAN AN HOUR TO FIND
HIM GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES.

38:39.339 --> 38:41.342
YEAH, RAYMOND IS GOING TO
SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN A

38:41.342 --> 38:44.147
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON.

38:44.147 --> 38:46.150
HMM, ALL THANKS TO VIC.

38:46.150 --> 38:48.553
YEAH, YOU HAD ME WRONG, HUH?

38:48.553 --> 38:50.556
NO.

38:51.758 --> 38:53.361
BUT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

38:53.761 --> 38:54.964
YEAH?

38:54.964 --> 38:57.767
SO... SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

38:57.767 --> 38:59.770
WELL, ADAM MANAGED TO PULL
SOME STRINGS TO GET YOU BOTH

38:59.770 --> 39:02.174
RELOCATED, SO YOU
CAN START A NEW LIFE.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.177
CITY OF YOUR CHOICE.

39:04.177 --> 39:05.379
CITY OF OUR CHOICE.

39:05.779 --> 39:06.982
WOW.

39:07.382 --> 39:08.584
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD ENDING

39:08.985 --> 39:10.187
TO THAT BOOK OF YOURS.

39:10.187 --> 39:12.590
YEAH.

39:12.590 --> 39:15.394
GUYS... I... I
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.199
GOODBYE WOULD BE GOOD.

39:20.602 --> 39:22.605
DEAL.
DEAL.

39:23.407 --> 39:25.410
I MISSED YOU.

39:25.810 --> 39:26.611
ME TOO.

39:26.611 --> 39:28.214
HMMM.

39:30.217 --> 39:31.819
IF YOU ASK ME,
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

39:31.819 --> 39:33.822
STARTING A NEW LIFE IN A
NEW TOWN WHERE NO ONE KNOWS YOU,

39:34.223 --> 39:36.226
NO WORRIES, NO PRECONCEPTIONS.

39:36.226 --> 39:39.031
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY'S
A LITTLE BIT ENVIOUS.

39:39.431 --> 39:40.633
OH, COME ON.

39:41.034 --> 39:43.037
HAVEN'T YOU EVER THOUGHT OF
JUST RUNNING AWAY FROM IT ALL?

39:43.037 --> 39:45.040
HMM, I DON'T KNOW. HAVE YOU?

39:45.040 --> 39:46.642
I DON'T KNOW.

39:46.642 --> 39:50.248
THE IDEA OF LIVING THE SIMPLE
LIFE SOMEWHERE IN SUBURBIA

39:50.248 --> 39:52.251
IS KIND OF APPEALING SOMETIMES.

39:52.651 --> 39:53.853
SUBURBIA, HUH.

39:53.853 --> 39:55.856
MAYBE FOR ABOUT A WEEK,
UNTIL THE BOREDOM SET IN.

39:55.856 --> 39:57.459
YEAH, WELL, AFTER THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS WE'VE HAD BORING

39:57.459 --> 39:59.462
ISN'T SUCH A BAD THING.

39:59.862 --> 40:00.663
COME ON, EMMA, I KNOW YOU.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.666
YOU THRIVE UNDER PRESSURE.

40:02.666 --> 40:04.269
WE'RE JUST NOT LIKE THAT.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.871
I MEAN, SOONER OR LATER,

40:05.871 --> 40:07.474
THAT LITTLE SLICE
OF HEAVEN'D TURN INTO HELL.

40:07.474 --> 40:09.477
YEAH, WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
VIC'S GOING TO FARE ANY BETTER?

40:09.477 --> 40:11.080
WELL, VIC'S DIFFERENT.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.083
VIC'S GOING TO GET
EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.685
HE'S GOING TO
SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE
WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVES.

40:15.086 --> 40:16.688
HM.

40:16.688 --> 40:19.893
I KNEW THERE WAS PART OF
THE EQUATION I WAS ENVIOUS OF.

40:19.893 --> 40:23.899
HMM...

40:32.712 --> 40:35.917
IS IT ME OR HAS IT JUST
GOTTEN A LOT QUIETER IN HERE...?

40:36.318 --> 40:39.123
YEAH.

40:39.123 --> 40:42.328
YEAH, WHEN VIC WAS AROUND,
YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHEN THE

40:42.328 --> 40:44.331
NEXT HURRICANE'S GOING TO HIT.

40:44.731 --> 40:46.334
HE SURE KNEW HOW
TO PRESS YOUR BUTTONS.

40:46.334 --> 40:49.138
JUST BECAUSE YOU
THOUGHT HE WAS A RAT.

40:49.538 --> 40:51.141
YEAH.

40:51.141 --> 40:53.144
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S NOT
EASY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

40:53.544 --> 40:56.749
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE
I WAS RAISED ON THE STREETS.

40:56.749 --> 40:58.752
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

40:58.752 --> 41:01.156
YOU KNOW, I...

41:01.557 --> 41:04.761
I SPENT A LIFETIME
BEING LET DOWN BY PEOPLE WHO

41:04.761 --> 41:07.166
I THOUGHT WERE MY FRIENDS.

41:07.166 --> 41:10.370
I LEARNED EARLY ON
THAT LOYALTY WAS EVERYTHING.

41:10.370 --> 41:14.376
THAT'S WHY WHEN
I DID WORK THE STREETS,

41:14.376 --> 41:16.780
I TENDED TO WORK ALONE.

41:17.181 --> 41:18.383
PROBABLY YOU
COULDN'T TRUST ANYBODY.

41:18.783 --> 41:20.386
NOPE.

41:20.386 --> 41:21.988
NO.

41:21.988 --> 41:23.991
YOU SEE, I'M VERY LOYAL.

41:23.991 --> 41:26.395
AND ALL I EXPECT
IS THE SAME IN RETURN.

41:30.401 --> 41:32.003
HEY, BREN...

41:34.006 --> 41:39.215
WHAT IF IT WAS ME, THROWN
IN SOME PRISON FOR SOME CRIME,

41:39.215 --> 41:45.224
AND YOU WERE PUT IN A LIFE
OR DEATH POSITION TO TURN ON ME,

41:45.224 --> 41:46.826
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

41:46.826 --> 41:48.027
WHAT?

41:48.429 --> 41:50.832
LIKE EVEN YOU TO ASK...

41:51.233 --> 41:54.838
I'D ROLL OVER
ON YOU LIKE AN OLD DOG.

41:54.838 --> 41:56.040
ARRRRR.

41:56.441 --> 41:57.642
RUFF.

41:57.642 --> 41:58.844
YOU WOULD NOT.

41:58.844 --> 42:00.046
YEAH, I WOULD.

42:00.046 --> 42:02.049
YOU'D BE SO
DONE, YOU'D BE CRISPY.

42:02.049 --> 42:04.052
COME HERE. RRRRR.
