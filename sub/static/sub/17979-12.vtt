01:03.094 --> 01:05.777
So, I might think
it's a start on our first cut.

01:05.778 --> 01:08.876
Still very rough. I'm working on
the order in little scenes.

01:09.755 --> 01:12.223
So what are you thinking
about prints and adds?

01:12.258 --> 01:16.132
Well, we're gonna give it a good push
PNA thirty second spots. We're

01:16.167 --> 01:18.797
thinking about a
feminine hygiene product.

01:19.708 --> 01:22.668
We think the film needs
a platform release.

01:22.703 --> 01:25.037
We think this is a film
that needs to find its audience.

01:25.058 --> 01:27.122
Well, we don't think of it
as a niche movie.

01:27.137 --> 01:29.851
Neither do we. We want
everyone in America to see it.

01:29.906 --> 01:32.570
Alright. We're just so thrilled
to have a major distributor.

01:32.572 --> 01:34.666
Of course, it's not just a gay movie.
That's for everybody,

01:34.691 --> 01:36.343
that ???

01:37.570 --> 01:40.046
- But there is one hiccup.
- It's minor.

01:40.089 --> 01:42.462
- What's the hiccup, guys?
- The ending.

01:42.497 --> 01:44.863
- Marketing says it won't test.
- What do you mean: "It won't test"?

01:44.866 --> 01:46.291
Test with who?

01:46.328 --> 01:49.093
Peoria. You know, the flyover states.

01:49.125 --> 01:51.742
Nebraska, Florida, Orange County.
I mean,

01:51.775 --> 01:54.451
it won't test. Like
lesbians are cool and sexy now...

01:54.485 --> 01:57.393
But we need them to be relatable too.

01:57.395 --> 01:59.142
We think the girl, the uh...

01:59.307 --> 02:01.240
What's her name?
It's the Niki Stevens' character...

02:01.305 --> 02:02.643
- Jessie.
- We think Jessie

02:02.737 --> 02:04.973
should go back to her boyfriend
in the end.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.711
What? No way.

02:08.616 --> 02:10.912
Just think about it.
Give it some thought.

03:25.546 --> 03:28.370
{\a6}You know, Angie's preschool
is only 7 minutes from my house.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.273
{\a6}Do you really like the west side?

03:30.308 --> 03:31.601
{\a6}Yeah, I mean,

03:31.645 --> 03:33.593
it's pretty great.
The air's cleaner,

03:34.098 --> 03:36.931
{\a6}you're near the ocean,
you get all the wacky light.

03:37.026 --> 03:39.001
{\a6}Are you gonna honk the horn?

03:39.047 --> 03:41.741
{\a6}- No, we're not gonna honk the horn.
- You know, I'm gonna be...

03:41.788 --> 03:43.700
Are you saying I should sell my house?

03:43.746 --> 03:46.861
- I didn't say that.
- I know, I just meant if we...

03:48.598 --> 03:51.622
get together, I mean, once we

03:52.566 --> 03:55.611
- decide...
- Let's hear mama B.'s speech.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.971
Come on, do your speech.

03:58.018 --> 03:59.203
Really?

03:59.205 --> 04:01.971
Well, there is this part
that I'm not sure about.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.153
If... Yeah...

04:03.188 --> 04:06.931
It's not just that she's a woman
though she underniably is.

04:06.976 --> 04:10.840
Jodi makes art with
found and industrial materials

04:10.888 --> 04:14.901
in a way that no one, man or woman,
ever even thought of doing.

04:14.908 --> 04:17.269
That last part, that's,
that's a little bit sexist.

04:17.305 --> 04:18.523
I know, I know.

04:18.555 --> 04:20.829
But I thought it was important
to underline the fact that she's a woman,

04:20.877 --> 04:22.401
- in this, in a way...
- That's good. Go for it.

04:22.448 --> 04:23.472
You're a good writer.

04:23.515 --> 04:25.551
You'll know how to say it.
And you'll be good.

04:27.035 --> 04:30.203
- Have you talked to her?
- No, no.

04:31.766 --> 04:34.923
But I did speak to Serena Dean,
it's the curator of the show,

04:34.928 --> 04:36.883
and she said
that Jodi's piece is amazing.

04:36.886 --> 04:37.923
Jodi...

04:40.695 --> 04:43.571
You have to find a way
to have Jodi in her life.

04:43.605 --> 04:45.461
They're very bonded.

04:45.496 --> 04:48.182
I just... I think it would be
just too confusing. I mean, it's just

04:48.226 --> 04:50.691
blurs the boundaries, and it's...

04:51.578 --> 04:53.013
Wow! Look at that!

04:53.047 --> 04:55.802
{\a6}- She looks amazing.
- Look sweetie, it's Alice.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.162
The light's green. Go.

04:58.195 --> 04:59.503
Hey!

05:00.595 --> 05:03.361
- Go asshole! Come one!
- Oh, Jesus!

05:03.396 --> 05:05.820
{\a6}We're never gonna get out of this.

05:07.616 --> 05:09.643
- "Cheryl Tweedy" by Lily Allen -

05:42.767 --> 05:44.261
Iris!

05:44.787 --> 05:48.360
Call with all my attorneys,
including London and Hong-Kong,

05:48.398 --> 05:52.222
it's the estate manager
and the direstor of the Peabody foundation.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.340
And get my daughter!

05:54.348 --> 05:55.763
I'm right here, mummy.

05:58.248 --> 06:00.552
What on earth are you wearing?!

06:21.127 --> 06:22.771
- "The Lucky One" by Au Revoir Simone -

07:02.045 --> 07:03.681
Did you sleep well?

07:05.016 --> 07:06.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

07:16.565 --> 07:19.140
- We should get up.
- Why?

07:19.178 --> 07:21.463
It's a terrible idea.

07:26.575 --> 07:28.880
We have breakfeast with your mother.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.802
Jesus!

07:33.518 --> 07:35.013
I made you coffee.

07:48.786 --> 07:50.413
That's a cute picture.

07:51.536 --> 07:52.612
Fuck you.

07:53.358 --> 07:55.273
Have some breakfeast.

07:56.655 --> 07:57.802
No.

07:57.847 --> 07:59.761
I don't have time.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.983
Why haven't they got an antidote?

08:11.036 --> 08:13.971
I mean, surely, if one exists,
and they have the way with all...

08:13.976 --> 08:16.522
Helena, everything's been handled.

08:17.275 --> 08:20.220
This isn't ??? jellyfish,

08:20.255 --> 08:23.422
they say that the vemin is
frequently lethal.

08:23.457 --> 08:27.153
Before I die, there's some things
I want to say to you.

08:27.197 --> 08:31.492
- Firstable, about your clothes...
- Mummy, you're not going to die.

08:31.536 --> 08:35.261
Very well and before I do,
I want to know that you're situated.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.812
I'm very well situated.
Thank you very much.

08:37.855 --> 08:40.743
A drab little hut in the dregs of Tahiti

08:40.784 --> 08:44.273
with the tax-evading granddaughter
of a vanilla-pod picker

08:44.305 --> 08:48.100
doesn't strike me as situated. Helena,
the Peabodys are keepers,

08:48.145 --> 08:51.333
not only of a vast fortune,

08:51.378 --> 08:53.110
- but of a legacy...
- Mummy,

08:53.778 --> 08:56.222
I'm not interested.

08:56.325 --> 08:58.103
It really isn't a proposition, Helena.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.190
You are my sole beneficiary.

09:00.237 --> 09:02.392
I've arranged for Davis and Arson

09:02.457 --> 09:05.171
to review all the estate holdings with you

09:05.206 --> 09:08.551
and the Foundation is in very good hands
with Albert Onescut.

09:08.707 --> 09:10.732
At some point, you just must take

09:10.766 --> 09:13.063
- an interest in day-to-day.
- Mummy, I'm

09:13.105 --> 09:15.940
gonna go talk to your doctors,
find out exactly

09:15.986 --> 09:18.470
what's going on about getting
the solution remedy of yours,

09:18.506 --> 09:21.321
because I have a standby return ticket.

09:21.845 --> 09:24.972
It's going to cost me $75
if I need to change it.

09:25.017 --> 09:27.311
So what kind of photography
you're thinking?

09:27.397 --> 09:29.463
- Nature? Abstract?
- No. No.

09:29.497 --> 09:30.742
Nature...

09:30.775 --> 09:32.612
No. I like, um...

09:32.646 --> 09:34.431
I like portraiture. Maybe,

09:35.256 --> 09:36.841
fashion, maybe...

09:36.886 --> 09:39.131
- Something like that.
- That's such a good idea.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.552
- You've a great eye.
- You think?

09:40.567 --> 09:42.103
Yeah, you should totally do it.

09:42.108 --> 09:44.113
Well, I wanna go to school first,
but then, we'll see.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.433
Fuck school.
I don't want you to school.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.172
You don't think
I can handle going to school?

09:48.178 --> 09:50.421
Of course I think you can handle it,
but I don't think you need to go to school.

09:50.427 --> 09:52.291
I think you need to go to work.

09:52.298 --> 09:54.522
Yeah, but before I go to work,
I'd rather learn...

09:56.045 --> 09:58.782
I don't know, I'd like to learn technique,
I'd like to learn what I'm doing.

09:58.785 --> 10:00.330
- I'd rather not schluff it off.
- I think that any school

10:00.378 --> 10:03.382
that will not take you would be completely
missing out and stupid.

10:04.907 --> 10:05.753
Thank you.

10:06.836 --> 10:08.643
- Shit!
- What?

10:08.645 --> 10:09.071
- "Au Moins Une Fois" by Cecile Hercule -

10:12.567 --> 10:15.172
- Who's that woman?
- Come on!

10:15.206 --> 10:16.781
Joyce!

10:16.825 --> 10:18.110
I am not going on

10:18.147 --> 10:19.710
- a lesbian double date with my mother.
- Yes, you are. Come on, come on.

10:19.755 --> 10:22.151
- Be an adult, be mature. Come on.
- Hey girls!

10:22.188 --> 10:23.643
Hey, I want you to meet Joyce.

10:23.727 --> 10:26.422
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I'm not shaking your hand.

10:27.166 --> 10:28.832
She tried to ruin my father.

10:28.867 --> 10:29.901
Remember?

10:32.557 --> 10:35.793
Would you excuse us for one second?
Come here a second, come here.

10:36.185 --> 10:37.982
I don't know what's gotten into her.

10:38.017 --> 10:39.270
Listen,

10:39.302 --> 10:40.646
what happened between your parents

10:40.641 --> 10:43.253
is what happens
in pretty much every divorce.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.676
They got through it.

10:44.679 --> 10:46.860
- Didn't they?
- Sort of.

10:46.868 --> 10:49.122
Yeah, sort of. But they did,
and you know it.

10:49.128 --> 10:52.172
Listen, and your mother deserves
hapiness as much as everybody else.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.572
Give her that.

10:54.577 --> 10:57.560
My father said she's
the most worthless lawyer he's ever met.

10:57.598 --> 10:58.992
- She's the anti-Christ.
- But she's a lawyer!

10:58.995 --> 11:02.212
I'm sure shit not having breakfeast
with her. I'm sorry. No.

11:02.217 --> 11:04.091
Well, if I recall,

11:04.095 --> 11:06.640
your mother wasn't too thrilled
about you seeing me.

11:07.308 --> 11:09.392
And now we're all here together.

11:09.395 --> 11:10.551
Right?

11:11.165 --> 11:12.770
Come on, you're not alone.

11:12.776 --> 11:14.143
- Let's go.
- Alright.

11:14.148 --> 11:15.632
- Come on.
- Okay.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.292
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

11:21.296 --> 11:22.760
- Yeah.
- A little bit.

11:23.368 --> 11:24.763
- "Count The Days"
by Inez & Charlie Foxx -

11:24.768 --> 11:26.520
Kit, this is very exciting.

11:26.557 --> 11:29.732
George Charles is ???,
he just ???

11:29.777 --> 11:31.133
And my good friend.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.712
Um... and we both agreed that

11:33.758 --> 11:36.572
that moon of yours
was a bit ridiculous. So...

11:36.607 --> 11:38.392
But he does love the space. Right?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.090
Well, it has great bones.

11:40.136 --> 11:42.642
Yeah, I hope you choke on them bones.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.690
A girl goes away for a couple of months,

11:53.737 --> 11:55.543
and everything changes.

11:58.305 --> 11:59.572
Girl!

12:00.008 --> 12:02.120
I'm glad to see you.
How are you?

12:02.167 --> 12:03.353
And what was he doing...?

12:03.387 --> 12:05.683
Well enough to remodel,
but you're not gonna change it too much,

12:05.727 --> 12:08.392
- are you? I loved it the way that it was.
- Oh, girl...

12:08.435 --> 12:11.883
This has none to do with me.
They, they're taking it over.

12:12.657 --> 12:14.722
- What?!
- Yeah. Okay,

12:14.758 --> 12:17.702
nevermind.
What are you doing here, girl?

12:17.738 --> 12:20.622
- We so missed you. We so missed you.
- Oh, I missed you too.

12:21.525 --> 12:23.052
My mother's in hospital.

12:23.085 --> 12:25.491
No, I think she's gonna be alright, but...

12:25.526 --> 12:27.622
She's a little touchy there right now.

12:27.656 --> 12:29.782
Oh come on, let's have some coffee.

12:29.827 --> 12:31.553
- Yeah, okay.
- And chat.

12:31.596 --> 12:33.282
- Do you have cookies?
- Yeah, girl,

12:33.317 --> 12:35.270
and I know, I remember
how you like it.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.560
Molly, I wanted this internship so bad,

12:38.597 --> 12:39.922
I could taste it.

12:39.957 --> 12:41.552
But I didn't have the score.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.933
What score's that?

12:42.978 --> 12:45.293
LSAT. It's a test you take
to get into law school.

12:45.328 --> 12:49.640
Well, you've done pretty ???
for yourself long here.

12:50.105 --> 12:51.483
Wait, did you get a good grade?

12:51.487 --> 12:54.720
Molly scored
in the top 2 percent nationally.

12:54.725 --> 12:57.243
- Big fucking deal.
- It is a big fucking deal.

12:57.245 --> 13:00.533
- It's one of the reasons you've got the internship.
- I don't want the internship.

13:00.536 --> 13:03.362
I'm spending my summer with Shane.
We're going surfing in Honolulu.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.530
Wait, wait a second.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.202
You never told me that this

13:06.205 --> 13:08.701
Supreme Court intern thing
was in the summer.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.782
You are not giving up a
Supreme Court internship

13:11.868 --> 13:14.020
- to go surfing.
- It's what I want to do.

13:15.155 --> 13:17.013
- "J'Aime Dormir" by Felipecha -

13:19.068 --> 13:21.153
Molly, if you're doing it
to get back at me...

13:21.197 --> 13:24.120
Mum, I'm not doing this to get back at you.
I'm so beyond that.

13:24.168 --> 13:26.102
I'm accepting your life choices.

13:26.145 --> 13:28.582
And if you and Joyce decide to get married,

13:28.617 --> 13:30.451
I hope you invite me and Shane
to the wedding.

13:32.056 --> 13:34.362
All I ask is the same respect from you.

13:57.548 --> 13:58.972
What are you doing here?

14:01.625 --> 14:03.793
Girls, have you got room for one more?

14:04.765 --> 14:08.613
I wanna meet you and Dusty in Tahaa.
I'm not kidding.

14:10.076 --> 14:11.851
It's pretty remote, Kit.

14:12.807 --> 14:15.390
You know, I'm not sure
that I'm gonna stay there forever.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.411
I mean,

14:17.035 --> 14:18.942
Dusty's great, but...

14:19.707 --> 14:21.992
I kind of miss this place.

14:22.025 --> 14:26.330
- I miss all of you.
- We've missed you so much.

14:26.376 --> 14:28.082
You have no idea.

14:28.088 --> 14:31.022
It wasn't the same without you.
Let me tell you.

14:31.057 --> 14:33.853
- It has been crazy around here.
- I just don't understand.

14:33.885 --> 14:35.422
Where did these women come from?

14:35.467 --> 14:38.192
From Hell. Via Miami Beach.

14:38.226 --> 14:40.082
Dawn Denbo and her

14:40.126 --> 14:41.630
servant maid

14:41.637 --> 14:43.531
- Cindi...
- Excuse me.

14:43.538 --> 14:45.192
Sorry.

14:45.198 --> 14:46.810
I just... I want...

14:46.816 --> 14:48.730
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

14:50.066 --> 14:52.820
You... want to say you're sorry?

14:52.826 --> 14:56.203
- You?
- I know, I know. It doesn't make a difference. But

14:56.595 --> 14:59.023
I hate what she's doing.
Okay? I do.

14:59.027 --> 15:01.273
I would've tried to stop her, but she's...

15:01.275 --> 15:02.793
she's crazy.

15:02.797 --> 15:04.801
Cindi, babe.

15:04.807 --> 15:06.833
I need you to do a few things.

15:06.836 --> 15:08.982
- Come over here, please.
- Thanks.

15:08.985 --> 15:10.691
I need you to go over the SheBar,

15:10.697 --> 15:12.873
and I need you
to wait for the liquor delivery.

15:12.877 --> 15:15.621
And I've got a meeting this afternoon,
so you're gonna have to

15:15.668 --> 15:18.012
set up without me.
Okay? Can you do that?

15:18.025 --> 15:20.132
Seriously. Can you go now? Because

15:20.136 --> 15:23.752
they're waiting at the delivery.
Thank you. Nice face. Thank you.

15:23.755 --> 15:24.580
- "Baby Drop a Dime"
by Inez & Charlie Foxx -

15:24.588 --> 15:25.963
Well, I quit.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.703
Well, I figured when you got me
to meet you down here.

15:28.747 --> 15:30.260
It's crazy.

15:30.307 --> 15:31.621
And,

15:31.666 --> 15:33.262
who are you meeting, anyway?

15:33.305 --> 15:35.743
- My friend J.J.
- Who's that?

15:35.788 --> 15:37.732
We went through Basic together.

15:37.778 --> 15:40.032
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. She's a cop.

15:40.066 --> 15:42.162
Oh, she is? A cop, huh?

15:43.205 --> 15:44.801
- Oh, there they are.
- Where?

15:44.846 --> 15:47.063
I want you to meet them. Come on.

15:47.096 --> 15:50.802
- What's up, you?
- Hey, get your ass over here, Williams!

15:50.846 --> 15:53.550
- Fucking Williams...
- Hey, what's up?

15:53.588 --> 15:56.893
- Alice, this is J.J. This is Karen.
- Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

15:56.928 --> 15:58.442
- Hi.
- Holy fucking shit.

15:58.488 --> 15:59.632
- What?
- I know you.

15:59.645 --> 16:02.490
- You do?
- "I'm Alice Pieszecki, and you're watching The Look"!

16:04.027 --> 16:06.090
You are so cool! Oh my God,

16:06.136 --> 16:08.762
- I love the way you handle that ass of Mary Lamb.
- Thank you.

16:08.805 --> 16:12.152
- Is she really such a dufus or is that...
- No, she's a dufus. Yeah, totally.

16:12.195 --> 16:14.051
Alice, can you join us for lunch?

16:14.097 --> 16:17.122
I have someone to meet,
but thank you very much. Yeah.

16:17.168 --> 16:20.372
Okay. Well, have a good time.
I'll see you later. Bye.

16:24.075 --> 16:25.923
Can I have your autograph?

16:25.955 --> 16:27.363
- You want my autograph?
- Yeah!

16:27.408 --> 16:28.983
- Yeah, please.
- What's your name again?

16:31.746 --> 16:34.260
- This is so cool!
- I have to work on my signature.

16:34.307 --> 16:36.192
- Okay, nice to meet you.
- Thanks. Bye.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.962
- Oh my God! She's awesome!
- Nice.

16:40.006 --> 16:41.550
- Yeah.
- Oh my godness...

16:43.546 --> 16:45.222
How's the movie doing?

16:45.256 --> 16:46.821
Let's talk about that.

16:46.827 --> 16:47.700
- "Writing a Check" by Jacquel -

16:47.717 --> 16:51.370
Well, this is good.
We've got distribution.

16:51.415 --> 16:53.231
- Wow!
- Major studio.

16:53.258 --> 16:54.540
- That's great.
- Yeah.

16:54.577 --> 16:57.402
I can't, I mean, I believe it,
and it's wonderful.

16:57.445 --> 16:59.420
We just have to work on a few details.

16:59.455 --> 17:00.971
Very, very happy. Good.

17:01.017 --> 17:03.183
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

17:04.055 --> 17:07.852
Niki came into my trailer the other day,
and she was crying.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.021
Really? Why?

17:10.068 --> 17:13.200
She says you won't return any of her calls.

17:13.896 --> 17:16.252
She comes up to me after every take
and she says:

17:16.277 --> 17:18.500
"Do you think
Jenny would have liked that?"

17:18.548 --> 17:20.241
Or she'll say:

17:20.247 --> 17:22.741
"Do you think that's what Jenny meant
when she wrote it?"

17:22.776 --> 17:24.800
Does she really say that to you?

17:24.845 --> 17:26.663
She misses you.

17:26.694 --> 17:29.932
I don't wanna be with someone
who's afraid to be who they are.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.851
- I think it's pathetic.
- She has a lot to lose.

17:32.906 --> 17:36.450
Well, so do I.
I don't have a career anymore.

17:37.387 --> 17:40.062
- My agents just dropped me.
- What?

17:40.666 --> 17:42.601
That's terrible. I'm sorry.

17:45.038 --> 17:46.933
You will get another agent.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.070
You're good. You will.

17:50.705 --> 17:53.313
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm just...

17:54.576 --> 17:56.580
Do you think I should call Niki?

17:57.746 --> 17:59.131
I don't know.

18:02.577 --> 18:03.820
Jessie!

18:09.237 --> 18:10.722
Jessie, stop!

18:10.767 --> 18:12.342
What do you want?!

18:13.286 --> 18:14.882
Look, I love you.

18:15.998 --> 18:19.592
Vipers don't love, Karina.
They poison.

18:19.737 --> 18:23.603
You used me as a pon
in your twisted relationship.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.700
I mean, how many girls have
you and Frances destroyed

18:25.785 --> 18:28.483
in order to tell your sordid stories
as foul play, huh?

18:28.517 --> 18:30.530
You don't understand.

18:30.565 --> 18:32.073
Oh, I understand.

18:32.117 --> 18:35.343
I understand enough to know
that I despise you.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.433
You're the only one
I've ever felt this way about.

18:39.466 --> 18:42.212
You're a liar! You're a fucking liar!

18:42.257 --> 18:44.040
Okay, that's very good.
Let's cut.

18:44.077 --> 18:46.573
Okay, that's a cut. Thank you.

19:09.076 --> 19:11.582
Tina, can I talk to you
for a minute?

19:11.628 --> 19:12.730
Sure.

19:14.506 --> 19:15.730
What's up?

19:15.775 --> 19:17.970
Adele wants you off the set.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.200
What?

19:23.128 --> 19:24.640
She

19:24.676 --> 19:26.052
has asked me to have you

19:26.098 --> 19:29.702
removed from the set. She said she can't work
with you looking over her shoulder.

19:29.746 --> 19:32.812
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
- I know.

19:32.855 --> 19:34.463
I know.

19:35.078 --> 19:36.731
- Thanks, Sally.
- Yeah.

19:41.537 --> 19:42.753
What is this?

19:52.056 --> 19:54.832
Well, loyalty's very important to me, Tina.

19:54.878 --> 19:57.740
And I understand
that your loyalty is to Jenny.

19:57.787 --> 19:59.403
You guys are old friends.

19:59.438 --> 20:01.160
But you should understand that

20:01.196 --> 20:03.320
I can't have you on my set
doing the bidding.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.903
What makes you think
I'm doing Jenny's bidding?

20:08.007 --> 20:09.662
Don't insult me, Tina.

20:09.705 --> 20:11.551
I know you had lunch with her
this afternoon.

20:11.576 --> 20:13.762
I know that you speak with her regularly.

20:16.528 --> 20:18.313
And I know that you understand that

20:18.358 --> 20:21.071
it makes it really difficult for me
to do my job

20:21.115 --> 20:22.900
when you're on my set.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.762
Adele, I'm the producer of this movie, okay?

20:25.798 --> 20:28.762
I busted my ass putting it together.

20:28.798 --> 20:31.571
Why would I let you kick me off the set?

20:36.817 --> 20:40.912
Because you want this picture
on schedule and on budget?

20:46.075 --> 20:47.953
This is fucking insane.

21:01.548 --> 21:03.292
It's so awful.

21:03.878 --> 21:05.630
This woman, she

21:05.667 --> 21:07.592
utterly deceived Kit.

21:09.937 --> 21:14.062
It's like she's some sort of
small-time petty con artist.

21:17.598 --> 21:20.400
She virtually stole the Planet out
from under her.

21:23.645 --> 21:26.221
Why don't you buy it back?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.050
What did you say?

21:30.055 --> 21:33.793
Every lowlife has a price, Helena.

21:34.568 --> 21:38.760
And most likely a peccadillo or two
that can be easily discovered,

21:39.585 --> 21:42.501
if she needs a little persuading.

21:42.537 --> 21:44.831
Isn't that extorsion, mummy?

21:44.875 --> 21:47.850
I thought you were against me
using money to buy my friends.

21:47.898 --> 21:51.411
Didn't these people stand by you
when you had

21:51.455 --> 21:53.961
absolutely not one red cent?

21:54.586 --> 21:56.890
My friends? Yeah, they did.

21:56.928 --> 21:58.913
So you wouldn't be buying

21:58.947 --> 22:02.021
friendship from them if you already have it.

22:03.065 --> 22:07.063
I really wish you would try to evince
some more clearheadedness, Helena.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.640
Mummy, you're the one
who's not being very clear.

22:14.606 --> 22:15.810
I mean,

22:15.875 --> 22:19.502
firstable, you took away
all my money from me.

22:19.825 --> 22:20.991
It wasn't your money.

22:23.618 --> 22:25.080
It was mine.

22:29.038 --> 22:31.061
I had to be sure

22:31.825 --> 22:34.831
that you wouldn't make a fool
of our saving.

22:35.476 --> 22:38.670
It's undignified

22:38.708 --> 22:42.403
to always lead with the bank book.

22:42.446 --> 22:45.623
What makes you think
I'm more dignified now, mummy?

22:48.068 --> 22:51.320
To tell you the truth,
I don't know that you are.

22:52.036 --> 22:55.691
But I have to leave
all my fucking money to someone,

22:55.728 --> 22:59.710
and I'm not going to leave it
to my Lhasa apsos.

22:59.747 --> 23:03.420
Talk about undignified.

23:03.456 --> 23:06.330
So what would you want me to do
with all your fucking money?

23:07.557 --> 23:09.332
As is your wont.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.293
Spend it willy-nilly.

23:15.385 --> 23:17.863
Buy your friend a nightclub.

23:21.946 --> 23:24.200
Buy her two.

23:25.998 --> 23:28.121
- "Why Did You Stay?" by The Pipettes -

23:28.127 --> 23:30.063
It's so more funny
that I thought it would be.

23:32.008 --> 23:34.790
I like it, this is so crazy.
Oh my God!

23:48.238 --> 23:50.433
- I mean, it's like a bycycle.
- Yeah,

23:50.467 --> 23:52.000
I just need to see your licence.

23:52.037 --> 23:54.242
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, is everything okay?

23:58.795 --> 24:00.403
Yeah, sure, no. I just, I,

24:00.445 --> 24:03.952
as long as you're home in time to get ready
for Jodi's thing tonight, it's fine. Yeah.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.710
I'm sorry you got a ticket.

24:06.747 --> 24:09.403
It sucks.
The LAPD can be total pigs.

24:10.056 --> 24:11.641
I kind of hate them.

24:11.687 --> 24:12.650
Yeah.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.160
So

24:16.205 --> 24:18.703
was that your girlfriend on the phone?

24:20.316 --> 24:21.833
Yeah, it was.

24:23.526 --> 24:26.183
That's a little bit disappointing for me.

24:29.527 --> 24:30.730
Me too.

24:34.365 --> 24:35.890
God, that sounded bad.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.310
It's the most natural thing
in the world to

24:39.345 --> 24:41.823
meet someone
you'll be attracted to and then,

24:43.056 --> 24:44.031
you know.

24:45.036 --> 24:46.302
Even if

24:46.338 --> 24:48.860
you're in a relationship
with somebody else?

24:49.545 --> 24:52.911
People do it all the time.
I mean...

24:53.507 --> 24:56.683
clearly it's not against their nature,
but...

24:56.715 --> 24:57.741
Right.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.140
I don't know, maybe it's designed to

25:00.185 --> 25:02.011
teach us something.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.030
What? That there are relationships
in trouble?

25:07.097 --> 25:09.281
They're not always. I mean,

25:11.857 --> 25:14.941
I don't know anything
about your relationship.

25:23.005 --> 25:24.880
I think I might be in trouble.

25:37.075 --> 25:38.410
I can't.

25:40.115 --> 25:42.073
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

25:49.857 --> 25:52.223
Have you ever been in my situation?

25:54.545 --> 25:55.892
Yeah, once.

25:55.926 --> 25:57.443
What did you do?

25:59.575 --> 26:01.481
I had a really

26:02.295 --> 26:04.440
great love affair.

26:04.477 --> 26:08.031
But I broke someone's heart, and

26:08.068 --> 26:10.120
I caused a lot of

26:10.538 --> 26:13.150
just general chaos and destruction.

26:13.198 --> 26:15.440
- So.
- Yeah. Sounds good.

26:18.378 --> 26:22.112
My friend Helena says,
"Whatever starts in chaos, ends in chaos".

26:22.155 --> 26:25.840
- So...
- Your friend knows what she's

26:25.878 --> 26:27.580
talking about.

26:34.077 --> 26:36.180
I promised myself that

26:36.188 --> 26:38.823
I would never do that again.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.701
- You just tried to kiss me.
- Yes.

26:41.735 --> 26:44.482
- It didn't really work out, I guess.
- Yeah.

26:45.508 --> 26:49.462
It's very difficult
to stand by your convictions when

26:50.548 --> 26:52.012
someone who is, like,

26:53.085 --> 26:56.963
sexy and smart and amazing,
who you're

26:57.006 --> 26:59.751
super-attracted to, is, like,

26:59.786 --> 27:00.930
this far

27:00.968 --> 27:02.841
away from you, you know.

27:10.678 --> 27:13.103
I just left a message for Sally.

27:13.145 --> 27:15.633
She'll call me
if anything goes wrong.

27:16.525 --> 27:20.182
I'm just so impressed
that you're keeping cool about it.

27:20.516 --> 27:22.330
What else can I do?

27:22.378 --> 27:24.411
We just have to get through tonight.

27:24.458 --> 27:25.790
We wrap at 4 A.M.

27:26.315 --> 27:28.120
and then tomorrow there's the party.

27:28.905 --> 27:30.683
Do you have to go to the party?

27:32.436 --> 27:34.473
I want to. It's my movie.

27:35.276 --> 27:38.710
And there's no way
that I'm gonna let Adele win.

27:40.797 --> 27:42.551
I really hope I'd be there with you.

27:45.755 --> 27:47.711
I wish I could be there
with you tonight.

27:47.746 --> 27:49.123
Oh, I'll be fine.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.680
I think I wrote a pretty good speech.

27:57.236 --> 28:00.243
I wish you knew
my favorite scene in the whole movie.

28:00.286 --> 28:02.053
It's the last scene, it's when

28:02.098 --> 28:05.180
Jesse finally ends it with Karina
once and for all.

28:05.215 --> 28:06.581
Her heart is broken,

28:06.615 --> 28:09.532
and she thinks there's no way
she's ever be in a love again.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.902
Well, 'cause Karina was her first love.

28:13.545 --> 28:16.622
And everyone always thinks
that wonderful first love lives.

28:17.706 --> 28:19.341
Yeah, you were my first.

28:19.376 --> 28:21.510
And I thought I would die.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.500
- I never left you.
- Yes, you did.

28:29.565 --> 28:31.573
But then you came back.

28:45.668 --> 28:48.092
She really wrote a happy ending.

28:48.835 --> 28:50.090
Yeah,

28:50.136 --> 28:53.162
she did. She wrote such a great ending.

28:56.146 --> 28:59.721
It's like Jesse's life is just beginning,

29:01.067 --> 29:04.093
and Jenny, oh my God,
who would have thought?

29:04.137 --> 29:06.120
But she pulled it together,

29:06.205 --> 29:09.410
and she wrote this amazing ending.
It's such a

29:09.446 --> 29:12.452
positive message for young, gay women.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.141
It's great.

29:15.177 --> 29:17.593
I'm sorry I can't be there.

29:20.045 --> 29:22.573
It's okay.
It's not important.

29:24.075 --> 29:26.113
What is important?

29:31.585 --> 29:33.202
You.

29:33.247 --> 29:35.221
Us.

29:59.665 --> 30:04.032
So, do you think Angie should have
a baby sister or a baby brother?

30:09.038 --> 30:10.032
What?

30:16.098 --> 30:17.942
Guess what I just did.

30:17.975 --> 30:19.251
What?

30:19.287 --> 30:21.912
I signed up for the police academy.

30:21.948 --> 30:23.813
- For the LAPD?
- Yeah.

30:23.858 --> 30:26.991
J.J. took me down. She teaches
one of the training courses.

30:27.027 --> 30:29.453
And they love the fact
that I'm an ex-military.

30:30.637 --> 30:34.642
They're really pro-gay. They even have
domestic partner benefits.

30:38.868 --> 30:40.552
You wanna be a cop?

30:40.588 --> 30:42.942
Oh, I filled up the paper already.

30:43.547 --> 30:45.760
I have my first training next wednesday.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.273
- Is it okay?
- Yeah, I was just...

30:52.316 --> 30:54.992
There's a lot. It looks like
you've got a lot to learn.

30:55.717 --> 30:57.410
- Yeah.
- It's great.

30:57.445 --> 30:59.231
It's great. I'm happy for you.

30:59.276 --> 31:01.721
If this is what you want,
I mean. Yeah.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.593
- I'm actually really excited.
- Good.

31:05.478 --> 31:06.452
Good.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.352
Yeah.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.201
Excuse me.

31:26.956 --> 31:28.432
Hello?

31:28.476 --> 31:30.440
I hope I'm not intruding.

31:30.487 --> 31:33.003
No. What can I do for you?

31:33.037 --> 31:34.601
I have a proposition.

31:35.195 --> 31:36.970
And I think it might be of interest.

31:37.015 --> 31:40.531
- Well, Dawn's not here right now, so...
- No, it's a proposition for you.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.131
Maybe we can talk somewhere privately?

31:46.598 --> 31:47.901
Yeah.

31:54.148 --> 31:56.421
- "Come To Me" by Koop -

32:08.648 --> 32:10.220
- Hello.
- Bette,

32:10.258 --> 32:11.901
I'm so relieved you came.

32:11.938 --> 32:14.613
After Jodi told me
what the piece was about, I...

32:14.655 --> 32:17.421
- Oh, Larry. Larry, do you know Larry Pitman?
- Of course.

32:17.465 --> 32:19.170
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Larry.

32:19.887 --> 32:21.453
Serena.

32:21.908 --> 32:24.222
What the piece? What?
What were you saying?

32:24.255 --> 32:25.653
Larry, I want you to meet...

32:34.757 --> 32:36.483
So you're gonna go
to the wrap party tomorrow night?

32:36.525 --> 32:37.912
- No.
- Are you?

32:37.958 --> 32:39.351
- No.
- No?

32:39.455 --> 32:41.222
Yes, I want you yo go.
You've worked so hard

32:41.328 --> 32:43.462
- and it's gonna be a fun party.
- No.

32:43.508 --> 32:45.940
Look, you should go
and you should support Tina.

32:45.977 --> 32:48.622
I want you guys to go
and represent me.

32:52.555 --> 32:54.551
This is so exciting.

32:55.437 --> 32:57.522
I didn't know
you were such a big deal.

32:58.338 --> 33:00.101
- Please, go.
- No, no, no.

33:00.148 --> 33:01.981
- You really want me to?
- Yeah, I do.

33:04.087 --> 33:07.171
Thank you so much for coming.
It means so much to me, you guys.

33:10.705 --> 33:12.072
Hey, guys.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.562
I'm really excited to see your sculpture.

33:15.377 --> 33:18.273
Thanks. I should say
I'm a little bit nervous and...

33:18.307 --> 33:19.980
Well, I heard the piece is re...

33:24.807 --> 33:25.860
See you, guys.

33:27.866 --> 33:29.353
Let's get inside.

33:29.398 --> 33:30.802
Outch.

33:34.315 --> 33:36.291
- Come.
- Alright. Let's go in.

33:36.365 --> 33:37.423
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

33:37.856 --> 33:40.540
- Come on.
- I wanted to thank you for this morning.

33:40.575 --> 33:43.031
I don't know what you said to Molly
to get her back to the table,

33:43.638 --> 33:46.651
- but I really appreciated it.
- No problem.

33:46.685 --> 33:48.500
If you have a minute,
can we talk?

33:49.007 --> 33:51.872
- Yeah. Okay.
- Come on. Very good.

33:52.938 --> 33:55.261
You haven't met Molly's sister, Sophie.

33:55.295 --> 33:56.960
She's a great girl too.

33:56.997 --> 33:59.543
- Solid, study...
- Yeah?

33:59.667 --> 34:02.593
- You're lucky you have two great kids.
- But Molly...

34:03.247 --> 34:05.323
- Molly's exceptionnal.
- Yeah.

34:05.368 --> 34:09.181
And I'm saying this not as her mother
but as the chancelor of a major university.

34:10.038 --> 34:13.532
Molly is one of the most brillant students
I have ever encountered.

34:13.576 --> 34:15.081
I'm not surprised to hear it.

34:15.116 --> 34:16.951
And you're not worthy of her.

34:18.905 --> 34:20.231
Excuse me?

34:20.985 --> 34:22.489
In the first place,

34:23.085 --> 34:27.703
the summer internship is
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

34:27.706 --> 34:30.460
Firstable, Molly is a grown-up.

34:30.498 --> 34:31.911
And I'm not telling her what to do.

34:31.947 --> 34:35.121
This is not just about the damn internship.
I know you know what I'm talking about.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.812
Yeah, Phyllis, and what I know
is that I'm crazy about her.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.841
Bette says you're not the kind of person

34:43.876 --> 34:47.000
any caring mother would want her daughter
to have a relationship with.

34:47.038 --> 34:48.489
- I don't buy it. Bette would never say it.
- She says

34:48.538 --> 34:50.091
you'd be up and after the first little hotty

34:50.128 --> 34:52.773
who shakes her body at you.
And you know your friend Alice?

34:52.857 --> 34:56.541
She told me that the longuest relationship
you ever had is six months.

34:56.574 --> 34:59.210
You proposed to some poor girl,
left her at the altar.

34:59.257 --> 35:02.031
Even your friends think
you're bad news, Shane.

35:04.768 --> 35:07.041
You know what really sucks though?

35:07.077 --> 35:10.251
Is if you did the same thing
to my daughter.

35:11.538 --> 35:14.600
Are you gonna throw Molly away
like a piece of garbage?

35:18.406 --> 35:20.991
- No.
- How do you know?

35:21.035 --> 35:23.450
How can you be sure
you're not gonna find someone else

35:23.486 --> 35:25.573
you can't keep it in your pants around?

35:30.788 --> 35:32.531
You know that is not fair to say,

35:32.565 --> 35:34.930
because no one knows that until it happens.

35:37.085 --> 35:42.161
Most of us possess
a certain amount of self-knowledge, Shane.

35:42.206 --> 35:45.250
Have you ever heard the expression
"Past is prelude"?

35:46.138 --> 35:47.791
No. Of course you haven't.

35:49.988 --> 35:53.321
This is not just about Molly's summer plans.

35:54.045 --> 35:56.380
Don't fuck my daughter over.

35:56.427 --> 35:58.553
If you even think you love her,

35:59.165 --> 36:03.893
spare her. Dont turn her into another one
of your heartbroken victims.

36:30.575 --> 36:32.593
Thank you so much for coming.

36:32.628 --> 36:34.473
It means the world to me. Really.

36:34.508 --> 36:37.143
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

36:37.175 --> 36:38.662
Sweet.

36:42.938 --> 36:44.640
I'm really honored to be there.

36:49.846 --> 36:51.210
I can't wait to see it.

36:57.538 --> 36:59.441
And you look

37:00.268 --> 37:01.482
phenomenal.

37:14.927 --> 37:17.220
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

37:20.098 --> 37:22.823
I want you to know,
I didn't know anything about it.

37:22.855 --> 37:24.281
It's okay.

37:26.458 --> 37:28.871
- Don't be a stranger.
- Don't.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.710
Don't you be a stranger.

37:32.035 --> 37:33.633
Welcome everybody.

37:33.675 --> 37:35.781
Welcome to the Hammer museum.

37:35.826 --> 37:37.540
I'm Serena Dean,

37:37.588 --> 37:39.663
the curator of this exhibition,

37:39.707 --> 37:43.223
and Phil is sorry she couldn't
be here tonight, but we're thrilled

37:43.267 --> 37:47.972
and excited to present a new piece
by sculptor Jodi Lerner.

37:48.008 --> 37:51.610
She made this for our
artist working new media series,

37:51.646 --> 37:53.582
and here to introduce her,

37:53.615 --> 37:54.801
is

37:54.847 --> 37:58.491
the dean of the School of Arts
in California university, Bette Porter.

38:04.218 --> 38:05.282
Thank you.

38:08.087 --> 38:10.133
From the first moment,

38:10.177 --> 38:12.261
she rocked the art world
in the mid 90's

38:12.278 --> 38:14.712
with her massive steel sculptures.

38:14.715 --> 38:18.352
A female body parts in domestic objects,
Jodi Lerner

38:18.396 --> 38:22.330
has redefined the landscape
of sculpture expression.

38:22.965 --> 38:26.171
It's not just that she's a woman,
though she underniably is,

38:27.046 --> 38:30.562
Jodi makes art with
found industrial materials

38:30.606 --> 38:35.222
a way that no one, man or woman,
has ever even thought of doing.

38:36.057 --> 38:37.231
I am

38:37.268 --> 38:40.551
repeatedly in art for her fiery choices,

38:40.586 --> 38:43.142
her total emersion in a process,

38:44.098 --> 38:47.830
her audacity,
which borders on defiance,

38:47.868 --> 38:50.040
and her works of art,

38:50.078 --> 38:54.871
which actually seem to extrude
from her subconscient mind.

38:54.906 --> 38:57.280
She has made me believe, all over again,

38:57.325 --> 38:59.760
in the redemptive power of art.

39:02.098 --> 39:04.211
It's just been a gift and privilege
to have her as

39:04.247 --> 39:06.352
our artist in residence at CU,

39:11.527 --> 39:14.271
and an even greater gift
having her in my life.

39:16.055 --> 39:20.560
And now with this installation at the Hammer,
she is giving a gift to our city.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.572
Please welcome Jodi Lerner.

39:33.086 --> 39:34.162
Thank you.

39:36.385 --> 39:38.742
This piece is called "Core".

39:40.455 --> 39:43.451
Because it's about core values.

39:44.066 --> 39:45.321
Love,

39:45.357 --> 39:47.281
loyalty,

39:47.317 --> 39:48.671
honesty,

39:49.498 --> 39:50.892
and commitment.

40:23.027 --> 40:24.421
<i>I love you.</i>

40:25.435 --> 40:28.333
<i>I love you. I love you!
What happened? What happened?</i>

40:29.035 --> 40:31.241
<i>Fuck me, fuck me!</i>

40:32.595 --> 40:34.643
<i>I love you. Core value.</i>

40:36.535 --> 40:38.853
<i>Go, go, go, go.</i>

40:41.845 --> 40:45.000
<i>No, just don't.
Leave me alone. Go.</i>

40:45.937 --> 40:47.680
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

40:47.686 --> 40:49.070
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

40:53.125 --> 40:55.070
<i>Fuck me...</i>

40:55.105 --> 40:57.530
<i>Don't, this is not a good time.</i>

41:14.686 --> 41:17.841
- "Coz I Luv You" by Slade -

41:32.045 --> 41:33.611
Holy shit.

41:33.648 --> 41:35.421
Who's that gorgeous woman?

41:44.055 --> 41:46.713
Hi. How you're doing?
Welcome to my club.

41:46.758 --> 41:49.342
I'm Dawn Denbo,
and this is my lover, Cindi.

41:49.987 --> 41:52.680
I don't think we've seen you here before.
Have you been in the

41:53.318 --> 41:55.481
club before?

41:56.306 --> 41:58.080
- I know, I know.
- Fucking Shane...

41:58.115 --> 41:59.763
You know Helena Peabody, right?

41:59.776 --> 42:02.882
You know, more important.
How in the fuck did you get past my door?

42:02.915 --> 42:03.953
Because you know what?

42:03.985 --> 42:06.593
You skanks really need to leave now.
Alright?

42:06.605 --> 42:10.003
Even though you have
a stunner of a friend here. Bye.

42:10.758 --> 42:14.222
Oh, wait a minute, Helena Peabody.
Isn't your mom the...

42:14.266 --> 42:16.991
She's telling us to leave?

42:19.706 --> 42:21.741
- I'm afraid you can't do that.
- Really.

42:21.788 --> 42:24.441
Why can't I, pretty little rich girl?

42:26.668 --> 42:28.662
Fuckin' Porter.

42:28.708 --> 42:31.200
- What?
- We own

42:31.235 --> 42:34.132
- this place.
- What the hell are you talking about?

42:34.166 --> 42:36.843
Yeah, baby. Here's your letters of your

42:36.888 --> 42:39.501
two primary investors.

42:39.606 --> 42:43.220
Who were more than happy to sell to us
at a profit. Especially

42:43.266 --> 42:46.731
when they found out that you'd
leveraged them within an inch of a felon.

42:46.777 --> 42:49.072
What the hell... Where did you get this?
This is confidential.

42:53.095 --> 42:54.680
What the fuck did you do?

42:57.775 --> 42:59.863
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

42:59.907 --> 43:03.360
How could I do anything when
I don't have a thought in my head?

43:03.368 --> 43:04.672
I mean, that's what you tell people, right?

43:04.707 --> 43:06.423
That "she doesn't have a thought
in her head"?

43:06.458 --> 43:08.121
Yeah, this is the thought in your head,

43:08.156 --> 43:11.812
- this is what...
- Get your dirty little hands off her, Denbo!

43:11.856 --> 43:13.461
Why should I?

43:16.065 --> 43:18.953
Because she's with me.

43:22.007 --> 43:23.181
By the way,

43:24.216 --> 43:27.850
the name's Tucker.
Not "her lover Cindi".

43:27.896 --> 43:30.710
It's Cindi Annabelle Tucker.

43:33.045 --> 43:35.541
Would you like to go dancing
in your club?

43:35.575 --> 43:37.092
Yes, I would love to.

43:38.176 --> 43:40.110
I was done with you anyway.

43:40.155 --> 43:41.710
Bye! Happy time.

43:41.748 --> 43:44.230
Why... why are you still
in front of me? What?

43:44.248 --> 43:47.452
You can go home.
Or you can stay.

43:47.457 --> 43:50.151
You can do the dishes
or wash the floor.

43:50.178 --> 43:52.950
- We've got a lot of glasses to pick up...
- That's funny, Porter.

43:53.897 --> 43:57.001
Guess what, it's not over.
Seriously.

43:57.048 --> 43:59.693
???. See you.

43:59.728 --> 44:02.552
Oh, fuck you! How about that?

44:02.597 --> 44:04.180
Alright, kiss my ass.

44:04.217 --> 44:07.861
Yeah, Kit. Leave it away.
Bye. See you soon.

44:12.596 --> 44:14.861
- "Do The Strand" by Roxy Music -

44:35.528 --> 44:37.080
Would you get me my drunk?

44:40.055 --> 44:41.781
Yeah, sure.

44:51.045 --> 44:53.301
- You're Vanessa, right?
- Right.

44:53.305 --> 44:55.571
- Remember me?
- Yeah, Shane.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.633
How are you doing?

44:57.668 --> 44:59.833
Good. I'm just looking for my friends.

44:59.877 --> 45:01.483
Hey, well, listen, if you ever wanna

45:01.517 --> 45:04.093
do something,
I have the same number. So...

45:05.236 --> 45:08.041
- I never had your number.
- Oh, you didn't?

45:08.087 --> 45:09.911
Well,

45:09.956 --> 45:11.323
then I'll call you.

45:12.036 --> 45:13.492
What was that?

45:14.255 --> 45:15.521
What?

45:15.556 --> 45:17.392
You were flirting with that girl.

45:21.407 --> 45:22.631
So?

45:22.667 --> 45:24.241
So, I'm right here.

45:26.528 --> 45:27.963
Molly,

45:27.995 --> 45:31.262
let's get real. You and I had a lot of fun,
but you're going to school in a week.

45:31.268 --> 45:33.362
Wait, no, no, stop.

45:33.407 --> 45:35.510
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm not... what am I doing?

45:35.536 --> 45:38.340
- I'm not doing anything.
- You are. You're freaking out,

45:38.376 --> 45:40.390
and you're scared, and

45:40.438 --> 45:43.062
you owe it to me and to you
to give this a chance.

45:43.128 --> 45:45.232
Molly, I'm not freaking out.

45:45.266 --> 45:47.810
- I never promised you anything.
- Yes, you did.

45:47.847 --> 45:51.170
In bed this morning, when you kissed me
and you held me, those were promises.

45:55.985 --> 45:56.932
Well, then,

45:58.796 --> 46:00.972
well then I guess
you misunderstood me.

46:08.666 --> 46:12.001
So what do girls do now?
Throw their drink in your face?

46:12.036 --> 46:14.160
Yeah, sometimes they do.

46:14.198 --> 46:15.730
I'm not going to do that.

46:15.766 --> 46:18.213
You don't deserve that.
You deserve compassion.

46:19.246 --> 46:23.142
But I'm not going to try to save you.
It's something you have to do for yourself, so.

46:24.545 --> 46:26.150
Good luck figuring your shit out.

46:30.385 --> 46:32.452
Take your time.
Hopefully, I'll still be around.

46:55.917 --> 46:58.700
That room was full of my collegues.

47:00.187 --> 47:02.691
My students, my friends.

47:04.386 --> 47:07.830
People I really care about.
Why would she do that?

47:07.877 --> 47:09.901
It's so humiliating.

47:11.777 --> 47:14.093
That's why she did it.

47:24.968 --> 47:27.340
You should just let go.

47:29.005 --> 47:31.062
You should just try and let go.

47:37.716 --> 47:40.610
The only reason I can
is because I'm with you.

48:33.028 --> 48:34.741
Unlock the door.

48:38.576 --> 48:39.541
Excuse me?

48:41.058 --> 48:42.611
Can I get a ticket for the...

48:46.356 --> 48:49.310
Oh my God! Look,
it's Sally and Sandra.

48:49.348 --> 48:50.742
Who are they?

48:50.786 --> 48:53.292
That is our line producer
and our first AD.

48:53.328 --> 48:56.703
I think it's so funny
how everybody hooks up on movie sets.

49:00.097 --> 49:01.632
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

49:01.676 --> 49:04.393
Hey you guys, how are you?
It's good to see you. This is Kit Porter.

49:04.437 --> 49:06.002
- This is Bette Porter. Sally.
- Hello.

49:06.045 --> 49:07.280
- Nice to meet you.
- Our line producer

49:07.285 --> 49:09.042
- and first AD.
- You look familiar.

49:09.077 --> 49:11.261
- She's got one of those faces.
- Yeah.

49:11.308 --> 49:13.553
William, hi.

49:13.587 --> 49:15.152
It's so exciting.

49:16.828 --> 49:19.060
- I just got the guy of tickets.
- Alright.

49:20.627 --> 49:22.013
Can I get a ticket?

49:22.418 --> 49:23.441
Thank you.

49:23.446 --> 49:26.442
You know what? Let's just
go inside and find our friends, okay?

49:29.097 --> 49:30.781
- "Koop Island Blues" by Koop -

49:30.786 --> 49:32.723
She's not the same person.

49:42.735 --> 49:44.781
- Happy wrap party.
- Honey, what's up?

49:45.697 --> 49:46.873
- Happy wrap party to you.
- Happy wrap party.

49:46.917 --> 49:48.201
It's over.

49:50.616 --> 49:52.501
So, where, where is Molly?

49:53.616 --> 49:55.071
- What?
- Where is Molly?

49:55.115 --> 49:56.832
I think she went to school.

49:57.687 --> 49:59.412
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:59.455 --> 50:01.121
You didn't wanna bring her in?

50:05.007 --> 50:06.172
What?

50:09.315 --> 50:11.113
- Drinks!
- Alright.

50:12.067 --> 50:14.222
- Let's do a toast, you guys.
- Okay.

50:14.886 --> 50:16.591
- To Jenny.
- To Jenny.

50:16.627 --> 50:18.293
- Absolutely on our mind.
- To Jenny.

50:18.328 --> 50:19.621
Cheers.

50:19.666 --> 50:21.203
I didn't realize that

50:21.237 --> 50:23.423
Tasha was so chummy with Cammie.

50:23.775 --> 50:26.311
Yeah, well, she's had a couple of drinks.

50:28.525 --> 50:31.292
That's so bad! Oh my God!

50:31.727 --> 50:33.871
- Really?
- I didn't know she drank so much either.

50:33.917 --> 50:35.883
Well, yeah, I didn't know either.

50:36.555 --> 50:39.881
I mean, I don't think
she likes to, you know, drink.

50:41.047 --> 50:42.662
- What's wrong?
- Can I talk to you?

50:42.667 --> 50:43.763
- I knew it.
- Okay.

50:44.346 --> 50:45.702
What?

50:51.048 --> 50:52.411
I met someone.

50:52.455 --> 50:53.803
I knew it!

50:53.838 --> 50:54.841
I knew it.

50:55.456 --> 50:57.963
I knew it.
Is that what she's drinking?

50:58.796 --> 51:00.643
No, I mean, I...
she doesn't know

51:00.678 --> 51:03.622
and I haven't done anything,
I mean, I've not acted on that.

51:03.658 --> 51:04.882
I swear this.

51:05.518 --> 51:08.112
- But you want to.
- Yeah, I do.

51:09.476 --> 51:11.382
But I know, you know, I know that

51:11.428 --> 51:14.832
the right thing to do is
to work on this with Tasha. It's, it's,

51:14.875 --> 51:17.232
- it's what I should do.
- Why? Why? Who says you should?

51:17.267 --> 51:18.393
- Why should you?
- Because

51:18.487 --> 51:21.591
we all just let our relationships blow up
at the first little temptation.

51:21.638 --> 51:24.140
Nobody works on their relationships
anymore.

51:24.188 --> 51:25.543
Everyone's out for instant gratification,

51:25.586 --> 51:27.151
and I don't want to be like that.

51:27.188 --> 51:28.683
I agree.

51:28.727 --> 51:30.071
You're right.

51:32.015 --> 51:35.213
But also, I've seen you in this thing
from day 1,

51:35.247 --> 51:38.062
and you've always given it a chance.
You both.

51:38.107 --> 51:39.580
I've worked hard.

51:39.616 --> 51:41.053
Yeah, you both have.

51:41.088 --> 51:44.013
So maybe now you've come to a point
where you realize you...

51:45.085 --> 51:46.913
you want something different.

51:50.018 --> 51:51.171
But that's okay.

51:55.055 --> 51:57.633
Yeah. But everything she went through
with the trial,

51:57.636 --> 52:01.013
- and giving up everything she believed in...
- Has nothing to do with you.

52:01.808 --> 52:03.943
That never had anything to do with you.

52:06.598 --> 52:08.290
You have the right to be happy.

52:08.628 --> 52:10.620
It's your human right to be happy.

52:16.007 --> 52:17.392
Who is she?

52:17.437 --> 52:18.663
I don't wanna say it.

52:18.668 --> 52:20.123
- I can't say my situation.
- Why?

52:20.175 --> 52:21.693
Oh, you're gonna die.

52:59.897 --> 53:01.931
Look at them together.

53:02.675 --> 53:04.211
Those two?

53:04.246 --> 53:05.853
Oh, they belong together.

53:05.887 --> 53:07.182
Yeah.

53:07.215 --> 53:09.252
They always have.

54:38.628 --> 54:40.060
Is that Niki?

54:41.096 --> 54:43.110
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey.

54:46.815 --> 54:47.922
What's shaken?

54:48.726 --> 54:50.831
I'm just avoiding people.

54:51.567 --> 54:53.602
Why? It's your big night.

54:54.346 --> 54:56.703
Yeah, well, these parties are lame.

54:56.738 --> 54:58.780
All these people always

54:58.816 --> 55:00.751
looking at me all the time,

55:01.108 --> 55:04.670
expecting me to like performing
like some trained monkey.

55:04.706 --> 55:06.970
I'm just so tired, you know, of...

55:09.526 --> 55:11.192
What are you tired of?

55:12.987 --> 55:16.552
Everybody wanting me to be
who they want me to be.

55:20.026 --> 55:21.782
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

55:24.457 --> 55:25.820
Well,

55:26.506 --> 55:28.881
let's see what can I tell you.

55:31.506 --> 55:32.583
Well, I,

55:32.627 --> 55:35.240
I fucked up something pretty great
last night.

55:36.577 --> 55:38.560
- Molly?
- Yeah.

55:38.567 --> 55:41.793
I got ahead of myself,
it is something. I just...

55:42.288 --> 55:45.342
I envision this kind of future and...

55:46.315 --> 55:48.022
I don't know, maybe I was wrong.

55:48.596 --> 55:50.022
I was all wrong.

55:51.205 --> 55:53.590
But we can't care, you know?

55:53.628 --> 55:55.003
I mean,

55:55.738 --> 55:57.062
as soon as

55:57.107 --> 56:00.020
it turns to shit, you just have
to get out, you know?

56:00.065 --> 56:01.383
That's what I do, I move on,

56:01.426 --> 56:04.213
because if you don't, you get caught
in there in bullshit and then

56:04.247 --> 56:06.572
you're screwed, you know?

56:12.678 --> 56:14.412
Yeah, I do.

56:14.455 --> 56:15.903
Well,

56:15.946 --> 56:17.791
I say to not give it a shit.

56:17.836 --> 56:19.332
- Hello everybody.
- 'Cause really, why should we.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.880
- To not give it a shit.
- No, we shouldn't.

56:21.886 --> 56:24.252
I wanna welcome you all here tonight.

56:25.177 --> 56:28.570
This party is my way
of saying thank you to all of you

56:28.617 --> 56:31.382
for your hard work and dedication
and all the

56:31.425 --> 56:33.772
creativity that you've

56:33.808 --> 56:35.331
brought into life.

56:35.365 --> 56:36.682
So,

56:36.728 --> 56:40.583
without further ???, I'd like
to turn the stage over to a person

56:40.616 --> 56:43.311
who I've recently come to know
and admire.

56:43.345 --> 56:46.990
Without her,
"Lez Girls" would not be

56:47.025 --> 56:49.821
the great success
that I know it's gonna be.

56:49.886 --> 56:52.941
She's a rising star in Hollywood.
Just today,

56:53.048 --> 56:56.030
she signed a 3 pictures deal.

56:56.067 --> 57:00.161
So let's give it up
for Miss Adele Channing.

57:07.628 --> 57:09.170
Thank you, William.

57:09.218 --> 57:11.141
I don't deserve these accolades.

57:11.187 --> 57:14.110
But I do want to mention that

57:14.118 --> 57:17.300
the first picture in that deal
was starring

57:17.338 --> 57:21.733
my beautiful and talented lady,
Begonia Garcia.

57:23.027 --> 57:25.430
She's the one they're really after.

57:25.476 --> 57:28.401
I also mention to you all that

57:28.448 --> 57:30.262
just this morning,

57:30.298 --> 57:32.570
we were picked up for distribution.

57:32.587 --> 57:34.531
We have a major distributor, people!

57:43.086 --> 57:44.681
As for myself,

57:44.725 --> 57:47.892
I know that I'm a joiner
who came lately to this project,

57:48.507 --> 57:50.723
and I just wanna say that
I am honored

57:50.767 --> 57:52.793
and priviledged to have played a role.

57:52.837 --> 57:54.991
To have learn
from the lights of William,

57:55.925 --> 57:57.600
and Aaron,

57:57.695 --> 57:59.422
Tina Kennard,

57:59.467 --> 58:01.321
Sam Makarejev,

58:01.367 --> 58:02.641
and of course,

58:04.055 --> 58:07.842
I know that I would be remiss
if I didn't mention Jennifer Schecter,

58:08.597 --> 58:12.491
- who gave me the opportunity to...
- I didn't give you anything.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.733
You stole it.

58:22.178 --> 58:25.053
- You want me to call security?
- No, it's fine.

58:30.277 --> 58:32.060
Go Jenny!

58:37.295 --> 58:39.181
Jennifer Schecter.

58:39.215 --> 58:41.172
We love you, Jenny!

58:43.746 --> 58:45.272
We love you too, Jenny!

58:45.317 --> 58:47.031
Thank you,

58:47.067 --> 58:48.582
all of you.

58:48.626 --> 58:50.361
Thank you very much.

58:51.157 --> 58:55.911
I realize that
the movie is out of my hands now.

58:55.948 --> 58:58.283
And I hope that

58:58.317 --> 59:02.013
those people entrusted
with this responsibility will

59:02.047 --> 59:03.501
honor it.

59:04.677 --> 59:06.461
I wanna thank this

59:06.465 --> 59:09.122
amazing, amazing crew,

59:09.168 --> 59:11.340
who have

59:11.378 --> 59:13.951
helped me see through

59:13.998 --> 59:15.732
my vision.

59:17.045 --> 59:20.661
I wanna thank my incredible friends

59:20.705 --> 59:24.431
who I,
I really love you, guys.

59:25.286 --> 59:27.262
You guys have,

59:28.337 --> 59:30.461
have shown me loyalty,

59:32.566 --> 59:34.602
and so much compassion.

59:35.315 --> 59:37.321
And

59:37.935 --> 59:42.150
friendship and I think that's what
"Lez Girls" is all about.

59:42.198 --> 59:44.392
It means the world to me

59:45.397 --> 59:48.352
more than any other movie or lover.

59:51.877 --> 59:53.823
Is, is Niki here?

59:53.856 --> 59:56.933
I saw her outside,
by the little pagoda.

59:56.975 --> 59:59.930
I wanna tell her something,
'cause I, I was...

59:59.978 --> 01:00:03.632
I realized something really important
this afternoon.

01:00:04.787 --> 01:00:08.153
That I am madly in love with someone,

01:00:08.757 --> 01:00:12.603
and it's changed the way I feel
about all of this.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:16.852
Thank you for putting up with me.

01:00:23.007 --> 01:00:24.563
Thank you, Jenny.

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.633
Let's have a great night.

01:00:49.115 --> 01:00:51.200
- "Ballade at Thirty-five"
by Carla Bruni -

01:01:45.017 --> 01:01:46.441
Oh, fuck, Shane.

01:02:09.565 --> 01:02:11.561
Oh my God...

01:02:12.855 --> 01:02:14.600
- Oh my God, Jenny!
- Jenny...

01:02:14.638 --> 01:02:16.221
What are you doing?

01:02:20.006 --> 01:02:23.432
Are you kidding me?
You agreed to change the ending?!

01:02:23.466 --> 01:02:24.693
- God, it's so...
- Tina,

01:02:24.717 --> 01:02:27.820
it makes total sense that
Jesse would go back to Jim in the end.

01:02:27.927 --> 01:02:30.213
Jesse never really felt gay
at the beginning.

01:02:30.296 --> 01:02:31.993
What the fuck
would you know about it?!

01:02:32.005 --> 01:02:33.582
- What?
- That is so fucked up!

01:02:33.658 --> 01:02:35.882
- Tina, come on.
- You're so fucking Hollywood!

01:02:35.927 --> 01:02:38.923
So Williams spends a little more money.
What's the big deal?

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:41.741
Even if you thought
that Niki and I had broken up...

01:02:41.775 --> 01:02:43.382
I swear, I'm your friend.

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:48.001
I thought that we...

01:02:59.055 --> 01:03:01.593
This is bullshit!
We worked really hard on a movie

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:04.260
that we believed in and
the marketing people just come along

01:03:04.298 --> 01:03:07.462
and change the whole ending?
The guy gets the girl in the end?!

01:03:08.148 --> 01:03:10.971
This is the movie that was supposed
to change all that.

01:03:12.057 --> 01:03:13.700
Look, Tina.

01:03:13.747 --> 01:03:16.772
If the movie's too gay,
it's going to alienate the audience.

01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:18.060
Too gay!

01:03:18.097 --> 01:03:20.390
It's a movie about lesbians.

01:03:20.438 --> 01:03:24.190
And the movie is full of lesbians.
It's choke full of them.

01:03:24.197 --> 01:03:26.791
Bev is a lesbian, Nina's a lesbian,
Shaun, Dona,

01:03:26.855 --> 01:03:29.430
- what's your face, the, uh, bisexual?
- Alyse.

01:03:29.478 --> 01:03:32.420
She's not interested. And when
we're talking about one character here,

01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:34.510
- it's not that big deal.
- I just wanna know one thing.

01:03:34.555 --> 01:03:36.542
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

01:03:36.606 --> 01:03:38.041
What the hell is going on?

01:03:38.085 --> 01:03:40.412
The studio wants to change
the ending of the movie.

01:03:40.446 --> 01:03:42.110
They want Jesse to go back to Jim.

01:03:42.158 --> 01:03:43.370
What?!

01:03:43.416 --> 01:03:45.262
They think the movie's too gay.

01:03:45.298 --> 01:03:46.580
Too gay?

01:03:46.617 --> 01:03:48.343
Wait, you're not gonna let them
go away with that, are you?

01:03:48.377 --> 01:03:50.842
I'm telling you it's the man
that does this crazy shit.

01:03:50.887 --> 01:03:53.123
Jenny, would you talk to me?
I'm your friend, please.

01:03:54.688 --> 01:03:56.722
- No, Shane.
- You guys, come on.

01:03:56.757 --> 01:03:59.203
- Can we all just be friends, please?
- Jenny, I am your friend. I swear.

01:03:59.247 --> 01:04:01.382
You know what?
It's the ultimate betrayal.

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:07.351
I'm gonna go get the car.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:11.650
You've broken my heart.
