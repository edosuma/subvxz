[Adeane] Everyone at the Post Office
is delighted with the new profile, ma'am,

01:57.120 --> 01:59.360
which they feel
to be an elegant reflection

01:59.440 --> 02:02.880
of Her Majesty's transition
from young woman to...

02:03.840 --> 02:04.880
Old bat?

02:07.360 --> 02:10.080
...mother of four and settled sovereign.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.000
Hmm.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.040
The Postmaster General himself
commented that the two images,

02:15.600 --> 02:19.920

02:20.280 --> 02:21.920

[man on TV] But, somehow, Harold Wilson
had to inspire the electorate

04:12.600 --> 04:16.080
to thrust a wedge into the Tories,
to win the floating vote for Labour,

04:16.160 --> 04:18.800
and stop the Liberals
stealing too much of the cake.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.240
Sir Alec's position could likewise
be affected by the Liberals.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.760
They've had quite a revival.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.360
In the 1950 election,
the Labour majority crumbled.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.200
Some of its great figures
were already ill.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.080

-Who?
-Wilson.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.480
Half his cabinet would be made up
of rabid anti-monarchists.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.880

05:30.000 --> 05:34.960
That his predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell,
was poisoned by the Russians,

05:35.040 --> 05:36.600
so that their man might take over.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.120
-Who did you hear that from?
-A friend of mine at the lunch club.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.800

05:54.880 --> 05:58.080

that Mr. Wilson was fine,

05:58.160 --> 05:59.960
or they would have done
something about it.

of the Industrial Revolution.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.600
Roughly late 15th century

10:24.680 --> 10:26.560

do you suppose?

10:26.640 --> 10:27.960

16:59.720 --> 17:01.880
Yes, it's a Labour gain.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.920
The Labour Party will form
the next government.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.840
People will be waking up tomorrow
in a new Britain,

a Britain whose destiny

[man] Sir, the protocol is as follows.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.880
When you're announced,
bow from the neck.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.080
First time you see the Queen,
you say, "Your Majesty."

17:58.160 --> 18:00.040
After that it's "ma'am."
Rhymes with "ham."

18:00.120 --> 18:02.400
Until you leave,
then it's "Your Majesty" again.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.320
Don't sit until Her Majesty does.
Don't talk until she does.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.480
Absolutely no physical contact,
other than taking her hand,

18:08.560 --> 18:10.720
if and only if she offers it.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.760
No small talk unless she invites it.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.080
At the end, she'll buzz,
and I'll come and get you.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.480
Bow from the neck
and walk back towards me.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.840
[bell rings]

18:29.760 --> 18:31.880
The Leader of the Opposition,
Your Majesty.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.200
[Elizabeth] Mr. Wilson.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.720
Thank you.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.160
[door closes]

18:43.240 --> 18:44.360
Your Majesty.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.520
The country has spoken.
Your party has won the election.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.360
[Elizabeth[ The duty befalls me,
as sovereign,

18:50.440 --> 18:52.480
to ask you to form a government
in my name.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.920
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.080
Uh, well, I suppose
I should kick things off with an apology.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.320
-Whatever for?
-Well, winning.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.440
I'm aware of your affection
for my predecessor

19:19.520 --> 19:22.440
and doubtless you'd have preferred him
to have continued in office.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.240
It is my duty not to have preferences.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.800
Well, we all do though, don't we?
We can't help it. It's human nature.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.040
And I can see the attraction
of someone like Posh Alec.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.960
Someone you can chat with
about the racing,

19:34.040 --> 19:37.160
someone well-bred, highborn,
who knows how to hold his cutlery,

19:37.240 --> 19:38.800
as opposed to a ruffian like me.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.880
Hardly.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.400
Still, the country said otherwise.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.600
They'd had enough of the mess
those Conservatives left us

19:47.000 --> 19:49.080
and the havoc they wreaked.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.080
Soaring land and house prices,

19:51.160 --> 19:53.360
race riots, sex scandals,

19:53.440 --> 19:56.880
large-scale unemployment,
rejection from the EEC,

19:56.960 --> 20:00.840
and an annual trade deficit
of £800 million.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.520
Yes, it's an unenviable legacy.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.480
What will you do about the balance
of payments? Will you devalue?

20:10.200 --> 20:11.880
No, m-ma'am.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.240
A Labour government devalued the pound
once before, with little success,

20:16.320 --> 20:20.880
and my party cannot risk being seen
as the party of devaluation.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.920
It is also a matter of national pride.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.240
This is still a great country,

20:27.800 --> 20:29.920
and the pound is a powerful symbol.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.480
Can't have been an easy one
to get used to.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
What's that?

20:37.600 --> 20:39.800
Well, you being part of that symbol.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.560
Your face on every coin and banknote.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.520
[Elizabeth] No.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.560
I remember seeing my father's face
on a shilling for the first time

20:48.960 --> 20:50.520
and thinking how odd it looked.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.880
At the same time realizing

20:52.960 --> 20:55.480
I would probably, one day,
have to look at my own face.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.440
But one never knows
what destiny has in store for one.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.440
Did you ever imagine
you'd be Prime Minister?

21:02.800 --> 21:05.480
-Goodness, no.
-How could you have done?

21:06.200 --> 21:09.680
-Mr. Gaitskell was still such a young man.
-He was.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.680
No one could possibly
have foreseen his death.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.440
No.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.320
-So sudden.
-Yes.

21:16.920 --> 21:17.920
And unexpected.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.720
Yes.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.600
Still, we make of our destiny what we can.

21:23.880 --> 21:24.880
Indeed.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.640
[Elizabeth]
I'm not sure what I was expecting.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.480
Each of his predecessors,

21:31.560 --> 21:34.080
Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, even Alec,

21:34.520 --> 21:37.320
each in their own way was formidable.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.920
Statesmanlike.

21:39.320 --> 21:42.200
But Wilson is neither old nor young,

21:42.680 --> 21:45.480
tall nor short, loud nor quiet,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.360
warm nor cold.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.480
He seems to have come from nowhere
and is entirely unremarkable.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.520
[chuckles]

21:52.600 --> 21:54.200
Best qualities in a spy.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.960
What did you say?

21:56.880 --> 21:59.160
Aren't those the best qualities in a spy?

21:59.720 --> 22:02.000
Well, to be forgettable, unremarkable.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.000
Not stand out in a crowd.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.160
We used to say that about Henry,
didn't we, dear?

22:06.240 --> 22:07.160
What?

22:07.240 --> 22:09.240
That you would have made the perfect spy,

22:09.320 --> 22:11.400
because no one could remember
having met you.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.040
[guests laugh]

22:13.120 --> 22:15.600
I-I-I'd say that was marginally better

22:15.680 --> 22:18.840
than everyone having nightmares
having met you!

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920

22:30.360 --> 22:32.040
[Duke of Kent] We do tease each other.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.680
With Tony, one never knows
quite who one's going to get

22:35.760 --> 22:37.640
from one moment to the next.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.800
He's changeable.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.680
He goes from loving to hating. Mummy!

22:41.760 --> 22:43.040
-You're not listening.
-Hmm?

22:43.560 --> 22:44.960
Of course I am, darling.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.680
Tony doesn't hate you.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.240
I think he may be starting to.

22:50.520 --> 22:54.480
You must try not to let him
consume you like this.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.600
The two of you
have your trip to America coming up.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.560
Yes.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.400
You'll be with each other round the clock,
working together as a team.

23:02.480 --> 23:06.240
Your father and I always
found those trips very bonding.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.160
Well, I hope you're right.

or have you eaten it all? Your Majesty.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.160
-Your Majesty. A thousand apologies.
-Hmm.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.520
Tony, darling,
come and sit next to your wife.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.800
Why would I do that?
I see her all the time.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.240
Well, she was just saying
she sees you none of the time.

24:31.320 --> 24:35.520
Hmm, because he's always working,
traveling, or waterskiing.

-[Tony] It's a ghastly little pond.

I think you'll find we own that pond.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.400
I share a speedboat there

28:19.600 --> 28:21.720
and to the cause of freedom.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.840
We shall think of him with thanksgiving

28:26.920 --> 28:29.600
that he was raised up in our days

28:30.040 --> 28:31.480
of desperate need

28:32.040 --> 28:35.160
to be a leader and inspirer of the nation,

28:35.680 --> 28:40.440
for his dauntless resolution
and untiring vigilance.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.360
My name is Michael Straight.

we pray that we, together with him,

28:53.160 --> 28:57.640
may be numbered among those
whose sins are forgiven...

29:02.840 --> 29:05.440
I attended Cambridge University,

29:23.880 --> 29:24.920
[Adeane] Right.

I'll confirm with Her Majesty
and come back to you straight away.

29:46.360 --> 29:50.000
[man] Director General of MI5,
Mr. Furnival Jones, Your Majesty.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.080
Your Majesty. Thank you for seeing me.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.040
It gives me no pleasure to tell you

30:08.120 --> 30:11.040
that we have been approached
by a former Russian agent

30:11.520 --> 30:15.120
who has identified a mole
at the top of the British establishment.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.360
So, it's true.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.680
-Ma'am?
-I'd heard the rumors.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.880
Initially, I dismissed them,

30:22.960 --> 30:25.840
but spending time with him personally,
in close proximity,

30:26.160 --> 30:28.320
one had become more and more suspicious.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.160
Indeed.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.840
And that he should have been able
to carry on for so long, undetected,

30:35.400 --> 30:38.800
is a subject of enormous embarrassment
to all of us.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.160
This obviously needs
to be handled very delicately.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.280
That's what I've come
to talk to you about,

30:44.360 --> 30:47.640
to see if we might find a way
to contain it.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.480
What? We can't do that.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.440

30:56.440 --> 31:00.520
Oh. Those rumors.
You're talking about Harold Wilson.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.200
-Yes.
-I'm so sorry, ma'am.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.520
Yes, it's widely accepted

31:05.600 --> 31:07.920
that repeated attempts
were made by the KGB

31:08.000 --> 31:11.320
to recruit Wilson when he was younger,
working on trade missions.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.760
He traveled to Russia a great deal
in those years,

31:14.840 --> 31:18.400
but the evidence for the Russians
having succeeded is so weak,

31:18.480 --> 31:20.400
we discounted it some time ago.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.480
And the poisoning of Gaitskell?

31:23.560 --> 31:26.120
Gaitskell wasn't poisoned.
He died of lupus.

31:26.200 --> 31:29.480
The fact is, even if the Russians
had poisoned Gaitskell,

31:30.400 --> 31:34.160
the most likely beneficiary would have
been George Brown, not Harold Wilson.

31:34.520 --> 31:38.280
Wilson was not favorite
to take over the leadership at the time.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.840
We don't have a Russian spy
in Downing Street?

31:42.040 --> 31:43.000
No.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.640
But it seems...

31:47.080 --> 31:50.400
we do have one in Buckingham Palace.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.640
[slide projector clicks]

31:53.720 --> 31:57.520
[Blunt] We look at a painting
and immediately want to know it.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.520
Understand it.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.080
But can anything ever be fully understood?

32:05.680 --> 32:08.200
Take our bearded trickster here.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.520
A Venetian cardsharp
originally ascribed to Titian,

32:12.600 --> 32:14.280
until new evidence came to light,

32:14.360 --> 32:17.360
proving the painting
is actually by Lorenzo Lotto.

32:17.720 --> 32:21.000
As time passes, so we learn.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.640
Truths are revealed.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.920
In the late Renaissance,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.040
painting after painting,
masterpiece after masterpiece

32:29.120 --> 32:33.360
seemed full of hidden intentions,
multiple meanings.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.240
Annibale Carracci's
Allegory of Truth and Time,

32:39.320 --> 32:42.080
painted in 1584 or 1585.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.280
This winged figure here

32:45.960 --> 32:48.880
rescues a young woman, his daughter,

32:49.400 --> 32:50.480
from the darkness.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.080
He is time.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.280
She is truth.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.520
And this figure below,

32:56.600 --> 32:59.960
trampled by truth, is deceit.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.760
Carracci's message is clear.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.040
Be patient. The truth will out.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.680
[Jones] I'm afraid I can now confirm
that the Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures,

33:14.160 --> 33:18.480
Sir Anthony Blunt, was the fourth man
in the Cambridge spy ring.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.920
[Blunt] The message encoded
in the painting is repeated in reality.

33:23.000 --> 33:23.920
As with the Lotto,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.920
time passed, and the painting was restored

33:27.000 --> 33:30.160
to reveal deceit is two-faced.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.120
She has a second, monstrous visage.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.560
[Jones] And that alongside conducting
a distinguished career as an art historian

33:38.640 --> 33:40.880
and member of the royal household,

33:41.840 --> 33:45.040
he spent 15 years as an active KGB mole

33:45.360 --> 33:49.600
and passed almost 2,000 documents
of sensitive military secrets

33:50.120 --> 33:51.200
to the Kremlin.

33:51.280 --> 33:56.120
Truth may lie beneath the surface,
buried, forgotten,

33:56.720 --> 33:59.600
but time has a way of uncovering it.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.200
One thinks of The Merchant of Venice.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.280
"Truth will come to light.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.680
Murder cannot be hid long.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.160
A man's son may...

34:13.480 --> 34:16.800
but at the length, truth will out."

34:19.000 --> 34:20.880
[inhales] Thank you.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.840
[applause]

34:35.560 --> 34:37.760
We had initially hoped
the information was false.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.200
We get these sorts of claims all the time.
But...

34:42.720 --> 34:46.360
we subsequently detained
and interviewed Blunt, and...

34:49.040 --> 34:51.160
I'm sad to say he has confessed.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.200
In full.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.400
[Philip] What's the next step?

35:04.800 --> 35:06.880
[Elizabeth]
Well, as a traitor to his country,

35:07.160 --> 35:09.960
he should, of course, stand trial,
be put in prison,

35:10.040 --> 35:12.080
and the key thrown away, quite frankly.

35:12.320 --> 35:16.880
Unless it was felt
that exposure of Blunt's treachery

35:17.280 --> 35:19.480
could cause even more damage.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.920
What, than keeping it silent?

35:22.840 --> 35:23.720
How?

35:23.800 --> 35:25.720
[Elizabeth] It could have
a catastrophic effect

35:25.800 --> 35:28.200
on the reputation
of our intelligence services.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.800
The fact that he had gone undetected
for so long,

35:30.880 --> 35:35.640
which could, in turn, seriously affect
our relationship with the Americans.

35:35.720 --> 35:39.600
We're on our last reserves of goodwill
with them as it is.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.160
One more operational failure,

35:41.240 --> 35:43.480
and our credibility
would be completely shot.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.240
What are they suggesting?

35:45.320 --> 35:48.600
That we turn a blind eye
and allow a traitor,

35:49.440 --> 35:54.840
an enemy of this country, to remain free,
with his career and reputation intact,

35:55.640 --> 35:58.320
just to spare MI5's blushes?

36:01.120 --> 36:03.440
-The man should be shot.
-[Elizabeth] I agree.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.520
But instead, I have to get up
and pay tribute to him at this exhibition.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.520
How am I supposed
to get through my speech?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.760
I might choke on my words.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.760
[Elizabeth] We stand here tonight,

36:29.840 --> 36:33.280
surrounded by some of the Royal
Collection's greatest treasures,

36:34.120 --> 36:39.000
to admire the genius of Rubens,
Titian, Rembrandt, and Holbein,

36:39.360 --> 36:41.600
but that we are able
to make sense of it all,

36:41.840 --> 36:44.200
appreciate it, understand it...

36:45.000 --> 36:46.880
speaks to the genius of another man,

36:47.560 --> 36:52.520
whose exceptional scholarship and vision
have brought us together today.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.480
-Sir Anthony Blunt.
-[applause]

36:57.760 --> 36:58.760
[Blunt] Thank you.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.720
It is he who has curated this exhibition,

37:04.200 --> 37:05.960
and given meaning to mystery,

37:06.040 --> 37:09.800
and revealed
what really does lie beneath the surface.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.080
I, for one, had never thought
of art history in that way,

37:14.680 --> 37:16.560
as the art of investigation,

37:17.040 --> 37:19.800
solving riddles, finding clues,

37:20.400 --> 37:21.960
unlocking secrets.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.320
It's been quite an education.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.400
I particularly enjoyed the portrait

37:27.480 --> 37:32.160
which turned out to have another person
lurking beneath the surface.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.120
Have I described that correctly,
Sir Anthony?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.760
Or am I stumbling around in the dark,
as usual?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.160
[audience chuckles]

37:41.240 --> 37:44.120
Not another person, ma'am.
The same person.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.800
It was not uncommon
in the early modern period

37:46.880 --> 37:49.000
for an artist to finish a portrait,

37:49.080 --> 37:50.440
and the patron would take a look

37:50.520 --> 37:53.560
and ask for a more flattering version
of themselves.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.640
And the artist would paint
another version over it.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.000
So, not two different people?

38:01.560 --> 38:04.080
Two different versions of the same person.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.440
Which might as well
be two different people.

38:08.440 --> 38:11.520
The idealized version of themselves
they want to be seen,

38:11.880 --> 38:15.520
and the less desirable person
they really are, hidden away.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.960
There's even a word for it: "palimpsest."

38:20.000 --> 38:22.520
That generally applies
to manuscripts, ma'am.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.000
"Pentimento" for paintings.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.240
Pentimento.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.520
Well, I think I speak for everyone here

38:29.600 --> 38:32.080
when I say none of us
will be able to trust

38:32.160 --> 38:35.600
or look at anything
in the same way ever again.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.840
[applause]

38:37.920 --> 38:39.920
[cameras click]

39:05.840 --> 39:06.840
Prime Minister.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.840
Your Majesty.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.440
I'm so glad you came.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.800
It gives me the chance
to apologize in person.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.720
-What for?
-There's no need to understand.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.360
All you need to know is
that I misjudged you terribly,

39:21.440 --> 39:24.400
and I'd like to take this opportunity
to say sorry.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.160
Are you an art man?

39:32.160 --> 39:34.840
-Art?
-Yes, art. Paintings.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.840
Well, actually, no. No. Uh...

39:37.680 --> 39:41.400
I'm an economist,
a statistician at heart.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.800
I'm happiest with numbers.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.240
You can trust numbers.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.080
They're honest.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.840
There's no mystery

39:50.920 --> 39:54.000
or deception or allegory.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.520
You know where you stand.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.120
What you see is what you get.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.520
And I prefer things that way.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.920
I quite agree.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.280
[cameras click]

40:11.080 --> 40:13.160
His Royal Highness
would like to see you, sir.

40:15.920 --> 40:16.800
Excuse me a moment.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.440
[exhales]

40:39.680 --> 40:44.200
The very least you could do
is quietly crawl away,

40:45.120 --> 40:48.600
not force us to live with you
under the same roof.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.480
But doing the... the right thing,

40:52.040 --> 40:55.000
the decent thing, the honorable thing...

40:56.040 --> 40:58.320
you wouldn't have the faintest idea
what that was.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.000
Well, I am going to be watching you,

41:03.680 --> 41:07.760
and one wrong step, you treacherous snake,

41:08.600 --> 41:11.080
and I will expose you
and have you thrown in jail.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.760
I would think long and hard
before I did that, sir.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.280
You would do well
to reflect on your own position.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.960
What are you talking about?

41:27.360 --> 41:31.120
You may remember,
at the height of the Profumo sex scandal,

41:31.880 --> 41:35.240
there was talk of a member
of the royal family being involved.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.640
No one knew who,

41:37.560 --> 41:40.800
but it was rumored to be a senior member
of the royal family.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.320
Very senior.

41:45.600 --> 41:49.320
When the osteopath at the center
of the scandal, Stephen Ward,

41:50.040 --> 41:51.240
took his own life...

41:52.560 --> 41:54.800
there was speculation
that a number of portraits

41:54.880 --> 41:58.280
of that senior member of the royal family
had been found in his apartment.

41:59.920 --> 42:03.840
Naturally, a great many people were keen
to get their hands on those portraits.

42:05.040 --> 42:09.880
Mercifully, someone respected
and well connected in the art world...

42:11.000 --> 42:14.200
was able to make sure
they didn't fall into the wrong hands.

42:14.560 --> 42:19.000
I never saw Stephen Ward in any capacity
other than as an osteopath.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.720
If he made drawings of me,
he would have done so from photographs.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.880
We all tell ourselves all sorts of things

42:27.960 --> 42:29.480
to make sense of the past.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.880
So much so that our fabrications,

42:32.960 --> 42:35.320
if we tell them to ourselves often enough,

42:35.880 --> 42:37.280
become the truth.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.560
In our minds and everyone else's.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.480
And believe you me,
I'm happy for your truth to be the truth.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.560
It would be better for everyone.

42:50.600 --> 42:53.280
Imagine how awful it would be,
for example,

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
if those pictures
saw the light of day now.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.320
The storm it would create.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.640
And for what?

43:04.320 --> 43:05.640
It's the past.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.520
-Would you excuse me?
-Of course, Your Majesty.
