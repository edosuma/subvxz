00:06.734 --> 00:09.294
- I let Lucifer out, I gotta put him back in.
- Yes.

00:10.671 --> 00:11.729
Sammy is long gone.

00:11.939 --> 00:14.339
Sam has been locked in the cage...

00:14.508 --> 00:16.203
...with Michael and Lucifer.

00:18.379 --> 00:19.869
It's his soul. It's gone.

00:24.451 --> 00:28.046
I can't erase Sam's hell,
but I can put it behind a wall.

00:28.255 --> 00:29.722
Keep digging, Dean.

00:29.890 --> 00:32.484
- Are you gonna be cryptic or...?
- It's about the souls.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.423
I will save Sam...

00:34.595 --> 00:36.324
...but only if you stand down.

00:36.497 --> 00:38.226
- What happened to you?
- I'm at war.

00:38.399 --> 00:41.391
I wanna discuss
a simple business transaction, that's all.

00:41.569 --> 00:43.366
You wanna make a deal?

00:43.537 --> 00:45.198
- With me?
- It's the souls.

01:01.488 --> 01:02.682
They're all inside me.

01:02.856 --> 01:04.881
Millions upon millions of souls.

01:08.362 --> 01:11.195
Angel blade won't work
because I'm not an angel anymore.

01:11.565 --> 01:12.759
I'm your new God.

01:12.933 --> 01:15.265
You will bow down
and profess your love...

01:15.436 --> 01:16.801
...unto me, your Lord...

01:18.739 --> 01:20.798
...or I shall destroy you.

01:43.430 --> 01:46.263
Well, all right then.

01:47.401 --> 01:51.098
Is this good or you want
the whole forehead to the carpet thing?

01:54.541 --> 01:56.133
Guys.

01:59.113 --> 02:01.047
Stop.

02:01.415 --> 02:03.747
What's the point if you don't mean it?

02:04.351 --> 02:05.818
You fear me.

02:05.986 --> 02:07.783
Not love, not respect. Just fear.

02:09.823 --> 02:12.314
- Cass...
- Sam, you have nothing to say to me.

02:12.493 --> 02:13.983
You stabbed me in the back.

02:15.562 --> 02:16.620
Get up.

02:20.701 --> 02:24.694
- Cass, come on. This is not you.
- The Castiel you knew is gone.

02:25.139 --> 02:27.767
So, what then? Kill us?

02:27.941 --> 02:31.001
What a brave little ant you are.
You know you're powerless.

02:31.178 --> 02:34.545
You wouldn't dare move against me
again. That would be pointless.

02:34.715 --> 02:36.512
So I have no need to kill you.

02:36.684 --> 02:37.776
Not now.

02:39.219 --> 02:45.124
Besides, once, you were my favorite
pets before you turned and bit me.

02:45.292 --> 02:47.453
- Who are you?
- I'm God.

02:47.995 --> 02:50.964
And if you stay in your place,
you may live in my kingdom.

02:51.131 --> 02:54.328
If you rise up, I will strike you down.

02:54.501 --> 02:56.594
Not doing so well, are you, Sam?

02:57.871 --> 02:58.963
I'm fine.

03:00.374 --> 03:01.864
- I'm fine.
- You said you'd fix him.

03:02.042 --> 03:04.408
- You promised.
- If you stood down...

03:04.611 --> 03:05.737
...which you hardly did.

03:08.482 --> 03:12.646
Be thankful for my mercy.
I could have cast you back in the pit.

03:13.921 --> 03:15.548
Cass, come on, this is nuts.

03:15.723 --> 03:17.850
You can turn this around, please.

03:18.025 --> 03:20.926
I hope for your sake
this is the last you see me.

03:29.369 --> 03:30.427
Sam, you okay?

03:40.147 --> 03:41.705
Understand.

03:41.882 --> 03:45.909
If you followed Raphael,
if you stood against me...

03:46.553 --> 03:48.748
...punishment is certain.

03:48.922 --> 03:51.152
There is nowhere to hide.

03:52.192 --> 03:53.887
The rest of you...

03:54.061 --> 03:58.122
...our Father left a long time ago.

03:58.298 --> 04:00.061
That was hard.

04:00.234 --> 04:03.169
I thought the answer was free will.

04:04.304 --> 04:06.932
But I understand now.

04:08.475 --> 04:11.967
You need a firm hand.

04:13.113 --> 04:16.207
You need a father.

04:17.050 --> 04:20.247
And I am your father now.

04:22.422 --> 04:25.050
Be obedient, children...

04:25.492 --> 04:28.256
...or this will be your fate.

04:32.966 --> 04:34.399
It is a new day...

04:35.435 --> 04:38.632
...on Earth and in heaven.

04:39.706 --> 04:41.435
Rejoice.

04:52.286 --> 04:53.776
Come on.

04:59.026 --> 05:00.425
Come on, baby.

05:02.629 --> 05:06.429
So you fixing her or primal screaming?

05:10.871 --> 05:12.532
Yeah.

05:13.841 --> 05:15.502
Thanks.

05:17.978 --> 05:19.445
Sam?

05:19.613 --> 05:23.208
- He's still under but alive.
- Oh, yeah?

05:23.383 --> 05:25.510
<i>What about God part deux?</i>

05:25.686 --> 05:29.486
I got all kinds of feelers out.
So far, diddly.

05:29.656 --> 05:32.022
And what exactly are you looking for?

05:32.192 --> 05:33.819
Exactly. What?

05:33.994 --> 05:37.987
Miracles, mass visions,
trench coat on a tortilla?

05:38.165 --> 05:41.794
- I don't know what I'm looking for.
- Ah, well, he'll surface.

05:41.969 --> 05:43.664
So say we do suss out...

05:43.837 --> 05:46.397
...where New and Improved flew off to.
Yeah?

05:47.774 --> 05:49.139
Hell we plan to do about it?

05:49.309 --> 05:52.176
Well, I don't know, Bobby.
I got no more clue than you do.

05:52.346 --> 05:54.405
I don't even know what book to hit
for this.

05:54.581 --> 05:55.843
Well, figure it out.

05:59.686 --> 06:01.381
I'm sorry.

06:04.858 --> 06:06.985
This ain't in no book.

06:08.328 --> 06:11.229
If you stick your neck out,
Cass steps on it.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.895
So you know what I'm gonna do?

06:15.068 --> 06:16.558
What?

06:17.671 --> 06:19.832
I'm gonna fix this car.

06:20.007 --> 06:22.168
Because that's what I can do.

06:22.342 --> 06:24.207
I can work on her till she's mint.

06:25.012 --> 06:29.278
And when Sam wakes up,
no matter what shape he's in...

06:29.449 --> 06:31.849
...we glue him back together too.

06:32.019 --> 06:33.919
We owe him that.

06:34.321 --> 06:35.379
I'm with you.

06:42.562 --> 06:44.223
Hey, Dean.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.929
Oh, you're, uh, walking and talking.

06:49.102 --> 06:51.229
Yeah. I, uh...

06:52.773 --> 06:55.936
I put on my own socks.
Whole nine, heh.

06:56.576 --> 06:57.873
Well, that's, um...

06:58.712 --> 07:02.614
- I mean, uh, you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

07:02.783 --> 07:06.719
My head hurts a little, but basically...

07:06.887 --> 07:08.912
- Seriously?
- I'm as surprised as you are...

07:09.089 --> 07:11.284
...but, yeah, I swear.
Good.

07:12.059 --> 07:14.653
No reason to put the gift horse
under a microscope, right?

07:14.861 --> 07:16.488
Yeah. So, what happened with Cass?

07:17.998 --> 07:20.728
- Help me with the car, I'll fill you in.
- Okay.

07:39.152 --> 07:43.145
Plenty speak for them
and their so-called lifestyle.

07:43.323 --> 07:45.291
Media, Hollywood.

07:45.459 --> 07:47.518
Lady Gaga won't shut up
for love or money.

07:48.962 --> 07:52.363
Yeah, funny.
But that's why we raise our voices...

07:52.532 --> 07:57.629
...and picket their so-called weddings
and their funerals.

08:00.007 --> 08:02.168
Someone has to speak for God.

08:02.342 --> 08:05.106
And who says you speak for God?

08:05.278 --> 08:08.406
You're wrong. I am utterly indifferent
to sexual orientation.

08:09.116 --> 08:10.674
On the other hand...

08:10.984 --> 08:14.886
...I cannot abide hypocrites like you,
Reverend.

08:15.055 --> 08:18.024
- Okay, fun is over, friend.
- Tell your flock...

08:18.191 --> 08:21.160
...where your genitals have been
before you speak for me.

08:23.296 --> 08:25.662
- And who the heck are you?
- I'm God.

08:35.375 --> 08:39.674
And he who lies in my name
shall choke on his own false tongue.

08:39.846 --> 08:42.542
And his poisonous words
shall betray him.

08:50.724 --> 08:52.817
- Mister.
- For I am the Lord...

08:54.061 --> 08:55.722
...your God.

08:59.966 --> 09:02.230
<i>Castiel.</i>

09:07.274 --> 09:09.401
<i>Cass.</i>

09:37.237 --> 09:38.761
<i>Sam.</i>

09:39.272 --> 09:41.536
No.
No, no, no, this can't be happening.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.198
<i>Sam.</i>

09:45.112 --> 09:46.579
<i>Sammy.</i>

09:46.746 --> 09:48.475
Hey, Sam?

09:48.648 --> 09:50.411
What,
are you taking a nap down here?

09:58.125 --> 10:00.320
- It's Cass, we think. Come on.
- Yeah.

10:00.527 --> 10:01.653
Coming.

10:01.828 --> 10:03.762
<i>Sudden deaths of some 200...</i>

10:03.930 --> 10:06.160
<i>...religious leaders
are currently under investigation.</i>

10:06.333 --> 10:08.233
<i>The Vatican has yet to issue
a statement.</i>

10:08.401 --> 10:11.564
<i>But some are already calling this
an act of God.</i>

10:11.938 --> 10:15.066
<i>We all saw him, no beard...</i>

10:15.242 --> 10:16.971
<i>...no robe.</i>

10:17.144 --> 10:20.602
<i>He was young and...</i>

10:20.780 --> 10:22.748
<i>And sexy.</i>

10:23.150 --> 10:25.948
<i>He had a raincoat.</i>

10:27.754 --> 10:30.245
<i>Believed to be targeted hits high up...</i>

10:30.423 --> 10:31.913
<i>...in white supremacy organizations.</i>

10:32.092 --> 10:35.027
<i>The FBI now believes
the Ku Klux Klan has been forced...</i>

10:35.195 --> 10:37.356
<i>- ... to disband.
- Can't argue with that one.</i>

10:37.564 --> 10:40.032
<i>Freak lightning strike
on the heels of the fire...</i>

10:40.200 --> 10:43.169
<i>...that burned down the Center for
Vibrational Enlightenment today.</i>

10:43.336 --> 10:46.999
<i>Said a spokesman, " This tragedy
represents the largest loss...</i>

10:47.174 --> 10:50.143
<i>...in New Age
motivational speaker history."</i>

10:50.310 --> 10:52.369
- Motivational speakers?
- Yeah.

10:52.579 --> 10:56.606
I'm not sure new Cass gets irony
any better than old Cass.

10:56.883 --> 11:01.013
Of course, old Cass wouldn't smite
Madison Square Garden...

11:01.188 --> 11:04.316
...just to prove a point.
He is off the deep end of the deep end.

11:05.358 --> 11:06.689
And there's no slowing down.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.851
So what? Try to talk to him again?

11:09.829 --> 11:12.024
- Sam...
- All we can do is talk to the guy.

11:12.199 --> 11:15.168
He's not a guy, he's God.
And he's pissed.

11:15.335 --> 11:17.633
And when God gets righteous,
get out of the way.

11:17.804 --> 11:19.567
- Haven't you read the Bible?
- I guess.

11:19.739 --> 11:21.297
Cass is never coming back.

11:21.474 --> 11:24.705
He's lied to us, used us,
cracked your gourd like it was nothing.

11:24.878 --> 11:26.971
- No more. We've spent enough on him.
- Okay.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.813
Hand me that socket wrench.

11:36.189 --> 11:37.816
<i>In biblical times.</i>

11:37.991 --> 11:40.755
<i>Leprosy was once so prevalent,
colonies were found around the world.</i>

11:40.927 --> 11:43.521
<i>Today, we're witnessing
the unprecedented shutdown...</i>

11:43.697 --> 11:45.187
<i>...of India's leper colonies...</i>

11:45.365 --> 11:48.664
<i>...after what many are calling
a miracle healing.</i>

11:48.835 --> 11:51.861
<i>Here with us,
health correspondent, Rob Lewitski.</i>

11:52.038 --> 11:54.438
Educate me, Lewitski.

11:56.943 --> 12:00.242
<i>And now someone else
Is gettin' all your best</i>

12:00.413 --> 12:02.404
Hello, Crowley.

12:03.149 --> 12:04.878
<i>These boots are made for walking</i>

12:05.051 --> 12:06.211
You look stressed.

12:06.386 --> 12:08.411
<i>And that's just what they'll do</i>

12:10.690 --> 12:11.850
Bollocks.

12:12.025 --> 12:13.856
<i>These boots
Are gonna walk all over you</i>

12:17.397 --> 12:19.888
So the jig is up.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.895
- You found me.
- I never lost you.

12:24.571 --> 12:27.563
These scratches, they're all useless.

12:27.741 --> 12:30.676
Still, can't blame a girl for trying.

12:31.411 --> 12:34.039
- You fancy a drink before you smite me?
- No.

12:34.214 --> 12:36.546
You like to bend them right over,
do you?

12:36.716 --> 12:38.411
Let's go.

12:41.955 --> 12:45.618
I'm not going to kill you, Crowley.
I have plans for you.

12:47.927 --> 12:49.656
- What?
- Here's our new arrangement.

12:49.829 --> 12:52.889
I let you live,
you return to your post as king of hell.

12:53.066 --> 12:55.762
- But?
- But I choose where each soul goes.

12:55.935 --> 12:57.266
- But...
- I control the flow...

12:57.437 --> 12:59.928
...and you take whatever I give you.

13:03.977 --> 13:08.437
I take it
you intend to keep the lion's share.

13:08.615 --> 13:12.073
So, what you're saying is
hell is being downsized.

13:12.252 --> 13:13.742
I would've done away with it...

13:13.920 --> 13:18.482
...but I need a threat
to hold over my enemies.

13:19.759 --> 13:22.023
And we need to keep Michael
in Lucifer's cage.

13:22.228 --> 13:23.422
Right.

13:23.596 --> 13:27.191
- I gather this is not a, uh, negotiation.
- No.

13:27.367 --> 13:30.359
Then I graciously accept, boss.

13:36.309 --> 13:38.368
I'll be in touch.

14:26.192 --> 14:27.784
Dean?

14:28.828 --> 14:30.295
Bobby?

14:39.005 --> 14:41.735
She's looking good. Considering.

14:41.908 --> 14:43.239
Considering?

14:43.410 --> 14:45.901
I should do this professionally.

14:47.614 --> 14:51.675
So, you seen Sam lately?

14:52.085 --> 14:53.814
Yeah, why?

14:56.623 --> 14:58.750
What? Well, spit it out.

15:00.193 --> 15:01.888
How is that kid even vertical?

15:02.061 --> 15:05.724
- I mean, Cass broke his damn piñata.
- I know.

15:05.899 --> 15:09.926
I mean, I get how he came to help us,
back at the lab.

15:10.103 --> 15:11.866
Adrenaline. Sure.

15:12.038 --> 15:13.733
But now?

15:14.207 --> 15:15.265
He says he's okay.

15:15.442 --> 15:16.602
How?

15:16.776 --> 15:19.244
I don't know.
I just pray to God it's true.

15:20.647 --> 15:23.616
We need to come up
with a new saying for that.

15:27.086 --> 15:29.782
Seriously, though, Bobby.
I mean, look at our lives.

15:29.956 --> 15:31.890
How many more hits can we take?

15:32.058 --> 15:34.822
So if Sam says he's good, good.

15:34.994 --> 15:36.393
You believe that?

15:37.096 --> 15:38.586
Yeah.

15:41.267 --> 15:42.632
No.

15:43.803 --> 15:45.634
You wanna know why?

15:46.272 --> 15:49.139
Because we never catch a break.
So why would we this time?

15:50.944 --> 15:52.104
But just...

15:52.278 --> 15:54.075
Just this one thing, you know?

15:56.583 --> 15:58.483
But I'm not dumb.

15:58.651 --> 16:02.849
I'm not gonna get my hopes up just
to get kicked in the Daddy pills again.

16:03.022 --> 16:04.148
Hey.

16:07.427 --> 16:09.918
Oh. How you feeling?

16:10.096 --> 16:11.688
- Can't complain, heh.
- Great.

16:12.665 --> 16:14.599
- What's the word?
- A publishing house...

16:14.767 --> 16:17.133
...literally exploded about an hour ago.

16:17.303 --> 16:19.965
The body count is getting up there.
We gotta do something.

16:20.139 --> 16:22.130
What we gotta do
is hunt the sumbitch.

16:22.308 --> 16:23.969
Unfortunately, I lost my God gun...

16:24.143 --> 16:26.338
Is there some kind of heavenly weapon?

16:26.513 --> 16:30.005
I mean, maybe something out of that
angel arsenal that Balthazar stole?

16:30.183 --> 16:32.651
There's gotta be something
that can hurt him.

16:35.455 --> 16:37.616
He's God, Sam.

16:38.725 --> 16:40.625
There's nothing.

16:41.694 --> 16:43.559
But there might be someone.

16:49.135 --> 16:51.000
No.

16:51.204 --> 16:52.865
No, no!

16:53.039 --> 16:54.199
Come on.

16:54.374 --> 16:55.898
Don't act so surprised.

16:56.075 --> 16:59.044
My new boss is gonna kill me
for even talking to you lot.

16:59.212 --> 17:01.009
Lucky we're not stabbing you,
you piece of...

17:01.180 --> 17:02.647
Wait, wait, wait.

17:02.815 --> 17:05.339
- What new boss?
- Castiel, you giraffe.

17:05.518 --> 17:06.678
Is your boss?

17:06.853 --> 17:08.047
Is everybody's boss.

17:08.221 --> 17:11.656
What do you think he'll do when
he finds out we've been conspiring?

17:12.358 --> 17:14.348
You do wanna conspire, don't you?

17:14.527 --> 17:16.893
No. We want you to stand there
and look pretty.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.560
- Listening.
- We need a spell...

17:20.465 --> 17:22.058
...to bind Death.

17:22.234 --> 17:23.361
Bind?

17:23.536 --> 17:26.334
- Enslave Death? You having a laugh?
- Lucifer did it.

17:26.506 --> 17:28.701
- That's Lucifer.
- A spell is a spell.

17:29.842 --> 17:34.040
You really believe you can handle
that horsepower? You're delusional.

17:34.213 --> 17:38.843
Death is the only player left
that has the kind ofjuice to take Cass.

17:39.018 --> 17:40.986
They'll both mash us like peas.

17:42.021 --> 17:44.922
- Why help on a suicide mission?
- Look...

17:46.593 --> 17:48.720
...you want Cass
running the universe?

17:52.432 --> 17:55.026
<i>Some help, please.</i>

17:55.368 --> 17:56.562
Please?

17:56.736 --> 17:57.794
Help?

17:58.404 --> 17:59.632
Some help, please.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.573
God bless you, sir.

18:07.747 --> 18:09.442
You're a true believer.

18:09.616 --> 18:11.140
People say I'm wrathful.

18:11.918 --> 18:15.217
But I only punish liars
and those who forsake me.

18:15.388 --> 18:17.481
I am ajust God.

18:17.657 --> 18:19.386
Excuse me?

18:23.162 --> 18:24.925
See.

18:27.033 --> 18:28.898
Oh, my God.

18:29.168 --> 18:30.829
I can see.

18:35.274 --> 18:36.571
Your face.

18:37.944 --> 18:39.275
What's wrong with you?

18:44.951 --> 18:46.350
<i>Mistake.</i>

18:46.552 --> 18:47.644
<i>Too late.</i>

18:49.188 --> 18:51.349
<i>Let us out.</i>

18:53.960 --> 18:56.121
<i>Let us out.</i>

18:57.630 --> 18:59.791
<i>Let us out!</i>

19:09.108 --> 19:10.803
No.

19:23.489 --> 19:24.717
Hello?

19:32.231 --> 19:34.199
It's from Crowley.

19:37.136 --> 19:39.161
Who feels
like hog-tying Death tonight?

19:40.173 --> 19:42.971
Old age is overrated anyhow.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.736
We got most of this stuff,
but we have to make a run...

19:45.912 --> 19:48.506
...for a few things.
Like?

19:48.681 --> 19:52.208
Like an act of God
crystallized forever.

19:52.685 --> 19:55.415
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Thinking actual crystal.

19:55.621 --> 19:58.181
See, lightning strikes sand
at the right angle...

19:58.357 --> 20:01.485
...it crystallizes
into the perfect shape of itself.

20:01.661 --> 20:02.719
Lightning. Act of God.

20:03.129 --> 20:04.323
Jenga.

20:04.497 --> 20:07.728
You got yourself a fulgurite.
We're gonna need a biggie.

20:08.067 --> 20:09.932
And let me guess. Rare.

20:10.136 --> 20:12.001
I found the records of an auction.

20:12.171 --> 20:15.504
Winning bidder lives
about nine hours from here.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.693
Hey.

20:39.866 --> 20:41.265
Excuse me, got any Grey Poupon?

20:44.737 --> 20:46.034
Grey Poupon? Seriously?

20:46.739 --> 20:48.900
It's what popped in my head.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.149
Hi.

21:41.494 --> 21:43.086
Uh...

21:44.363 --> 21:45.489
I don't wanna hurt you.

21:45.665 --> 21:49.294
- Really.
- I'm the one with the firearm, son.

21:50.837 --> 21:52.634
I get that.

21:56.609 --> 21:58.304
Okay.

21:58.845 --> 22:01.279
Yeah. Good.

22:05.351 --> 22:07.114
Hey, guys.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.255
Uh, so this is Dr. And Mrs. Weiss.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.780
Hi.

22:13.392 --> 22:15.690
- Sorry.
- I found the God thingy.

22:17.363 --> 22:19.957
Well, let's light this candle.

22:44.290 --> 22:45.689
You're welcome.

23:32.071 --> 23:33.333
Um...

23:33.773 --> 23:35.468
Hello?

23:36.075 --> 23:37.633
Death?

23:37.944 --> 23:39.935
You're joking.

23:42.782 --> 23:44.647
Sorry, Death.
This isn't what it seems.

23:44.850 --> 23:47.444
Seems like you bound me.

23:47.620 --> 23:50.214
For good reason, okay?
Just, uh, hear us out.

23:51.123 --> 23:52.385
Um...

23:52.558 --> 23:53.616
Fried pickle chip?

23:54.427 --> 23:55.758
The best in the state.

23:55.928 --> 23:57.589
That easy to soothe me, you think?

23:59.999 --> 24:02.866
This is about Sam's hallucinations,
I assume?

24:04.470 --> 24:08.600
- What?
- Sorry, Sam, one wall per customer.

24:08.774 --> 24:11.675
- Now unbind me.
- We can't.

24:12.378 --> 24:13.572
Yet.

24:13.746 --> 24:15.441
This isn't gonna end well.

24:15.915 --> 24:18.110
We need you to kill God.

24:18.918 --> 24:20.818
- Pardon?
- Kill God.

24:21.487 --> 24:24.320
You heard right, Your Honor.

24:24.490 --> 24:27.084
- What makes you think I can do that?
- You told me.

24:30.029 --> 24:31.121
Why should I?

24:34.033 --> 24:38.299
Because we said so
and we're the boss of you.

24:40.473 --> 24:42.100
I mean, respectfully.

24:42.842 --> 24:44.969
Amazing.

24:48.214 --> 24:49.875
- Cass.
- I didn't want to kill you.

24:50.049 --> 24:52.017
- But now...
- You can't kill us.

24:52.184 --> 24:54.209
You've erased
any nostalgia I had for you.

24:54.420 --> 24:55.978
Death is our bitch.

24:56.355 --> 24:58.346
We ain't gonna die,
even if God pulls the trigger.

24:58.524 --> 25:01.721
Annoying little protozoa, aren't they?

25:02.528 --> 25:04.155
God?

25:04.864 --> 25:08.061
You look awfully
like a mutated angel to me.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.862
Your vessel is melting.
You're going to explode.

25:11.037 --> 25:12.334
No, I'm not.

25:13.139 --> 25:14.401
When I've finished my work...

25:14.573 --> 25:16.734
- ...I'll repair myself.
- You think you can...

25:16.942 --> 25:20.241
...because you think you're simply
under the weight of those souls.

25:20.446 --> 25:22.812
But that's not the worst problem.

25:22.982 --> 25:25.815
There are things much older than souls
in purgatory...

25:25.985 --> 25:27.850
...and you gulped those in too.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.078
Irrelevant.

25:29.655 --> 25:32.089
- I control them.
- For the moment.

25:32.258 --> 25:34.385
Wait. Uh, what older things?

25:35.494 --> 25:39.521
Long before God created angel or man,
he made the first beasts.

25:40.466 --> 25:41.990
The Leviathans.

25:42.468 --> 25:43.526
Leviathans?

25:43.702 --> 25:45.533
I personally found them entertaining...

25:45.704 --> 25:48.400
...but he was concerned
they'd chomp the entire Petri dish.

25:48.574 --> 25:51.099
So he locked them away.

25:51.277 --> 25:53.768
Why do you think
he created purgatory?

25:54.747 --> 25:58.581
To keep those clever,
poisonous things out.

25:58.751 --> 26:01.379
Now, Castiel has swallowed them.

26:02.288 --> 26:07.225
He's the one thin membrane
between the Old Ones and your home.

26:07.393 --> 26:10.385
- Enough.
- Stupid little soldier you are.

26:10.729 --> 26:12.219
Why?

26:12.498 --> 26:15.433
Because I dared open a door
that he shut?

26:16.001 --> 26:17.969
Where is he?

26:18.137 --> 26:20.196
I did a service taking his place.

26:20.372 --> 26:21.634
Service?

26:21.807 --> 26:24.241
- Settling petty vendettas?
- No.

26:24.410 --> 26:28.437
I'm cleaning up one mess after another,
selflessly.

26:28.614 --> 26:31.879
- Quite the humanitarian.
- And how would you know?

26:33.552 --> 26:36.316
What are you really?

26:36.889 --> 26:37.947
A flyswatter?

26:38.290 --> 26:40.417
Destined to swat you, I think.

26:40.926 --> 26:43.258
Unless I take you first.

26:44.063 --> 26:47.123
Really bought his own press, this one.

26:47.766 --> 26:49.825
Please, Cass...

26:50.035 --> 26:51.764
...I know God.

26:51.937 --> 26:54.428
And you, sir, are no God.

26:54.607 --> 26:56.632
All right, put yourjunk away,
both of you.

26:56.809 --> 26:59.801
Look, call him what you want,
just kill him now.

27:02.781 --> 27:05.147
All right, fine.

27:10.789 --> 27:11.847
Thank you.

27:13.292 --> 27:14.691
Shall we kickbox now?

27:18.097 --> 27:23.626
I had a tingle I'd be reaping someone
very, very soon.

27:24.670 --> 27:25.762
Don't worry, not you.

27:32.077 --> 27:34.307
Well, he was in a hurry.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.382
Yes, that's exactly why I'm running
again. To save my constituents...

27:38.584 --> 27:40.950
...from the godless policies
of my opponents.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.782
Couldn't have said it better myself.

27:49.962 --> 27:53.329
- Sir, can I help you?
- I'm here to see the senator.

27:53.499 --> 27:54.830
Um...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.093
- Regarding?
- Abuse of power.

27:58.404 --> 28:01.134
- Excuse me?
- I'm not petty.

28:01.507 --> 28:02.735
I'm punishing a woman...

28:02.908 --> 28:06.207
...who causes poverty and despair
in my name.

28:06.378 --> 28:09.347
I put your needs first,
don't you understand?

28:10.649 --> 28:11.707
All of you.

28:12.818 --> 28:16.914
I am a better God than my father.

28:17.122 --> 28:19.090
How can I make you understand?

28:36.909 --> 28:38.843
Ahem. Um...

28:39.011 --> 28:41.036
Shut up, Dean.

28:41.213 --> 28:44.341
I'm not here to tie your shoes
every time you trip.

28:44.850 --> 28:48.684
I warned you about those souls
how long ago?

28:48.921 --> 28:52.015
Long enough to stop that fool.

28:52.191 --> 28:54.386
Here we are again,
with your little planet...

28:54.560 --> 28:56.357
...on the edge of immolation.

28:57.062 --> 28:59.462
Well, I'm sorry, all right?

28:59.665 --> 29:01.428
I've been trying to save this planet.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.091
So maybe you should find
somebody better to tip off.

29:04.270 --> 29:07.967
Maybe I should spend my effort
on a better planet.

29:08.741 --> 29:10.208
Well, it's been amusing.

29:10.376 --> 29:11.968
Wait, hold on. Hold on. Just...

29:12.411 --> 29:14.436
Give us something.
You have to care...

29:14.613 --> 29:17.707
...about what happens to us.
You know, I really don't.

29:17.883 --> 29:20.613
But I do find that little angel arrogant.

29:20.786 --> 29:22.219
Great, let's go with that.

29:22.388 --> 29:26.791
Your only hope
is to have him return it all to purgatory.

29:27.192 --> 29:28.489
Quickly.

29:28.694 --> 29:29.752
We need a door.

29:29.928 --> 29:32.624
You have everything you need
at that lab.

29:32.965 --> 29:34.296
Get him to return there...

29:34.466 --> 29:36.900
...and compel him
to give up the power.

29:37.069 --> 29:39.902
- Compel?
- Figure it out.

29:40.072 --> 29:44.406
But that door only opens in the eclipse.
And that's over.

29:44.576 --> 29:45.770
I'll make another.

29:46.578 --> 29:49.103
Three fifty-nine, Sunday morning...

29:49.281 --> 29:51.146
...just before dawn.

29:51.317 --> 29:53.342
Be punctual.

29:53.519 --> 29:55.487
Don't thank me.

29:55.654 --> 29:58.214
Clean up your mess.

30:02.161 --> 30:04.425
Try to bind me again...

30:04.596 --> 30:07.463
...you'll die before you start.

30:10.369 --> 30:12.360
Nice pickle chips, by the way.

30:39.898 --> 30:41.490
No.

30:41.867 --> 30:42.959
No.

31:08.293 --> 31:10.352
You want some coffee with that?

31:10.696 --> 31:12.926
- Oh, it's 6 p.m. Somewhere.
- We gotta hit the road.

31:13.098 --> 31:16.431
How are we supposed to get Cass
to that lab by friggin' 3:59 a. M?

31:16.602 --> 31:18.092
We don't.

31:19.538 --> 31:22.336
- What do you mean?
- We can't bring the horse to water...

31:22.508 --> 31:24.942
...and we can't make it drink.
Why fool ourselves?

31:25.110 --> 31:27.442
Dean, look.
I know you think that Cass is gone.

31:27.613 --> 31:29.205
- That's because he is.
- He's not.

31:29.381 --> 31:31.212
He's in there somewhere, Dean.

31:31.383 --> 31:32.850
- I know it.
- No, you don't.

31:33.419 --> 31:36.252
I don't. But I was pretty far gone
sometimes myself...

31:36.422 --> 31:38.413
...you never gave up on me.
Turns out...

31:38.590 --> 31:42.185
...that you're about the same open book
as you've always been.

31:42.528 --> 31:43.722
Hallucinations?

31:43.896 --> 31:45.955
Really? I gotta find out from Death?

31:47.599 --> 31:49.032
What was I supposed to do?

31:49.201 --> 31:50.259
How about not lie?

31:51.870 --> 31:54.202
How about tell me
that you've got crazy crap...

31:54.373 --> 31:56.136
...climbing those walls?
Why?

31:57.476 --> 31:58.602
You can't help.

32:00.913 --> 32:04.405
You got a lot of pretty severe crap
swinging your way lately, I thought...

32:04.583 --> 32:08.041
What, I thought why burst
the one good bubble you had left?

32:08.220 --> 32:10.245
It's under control.

32:10.489 --> 32:12.081
What?

32:12.257 --> 32:14.885
- What's under control?
- I know what's real, what's not.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.721
- Sam.
- Look, we can debate this...

32:16.895 --> 32:18.487
...once we deal with Cass.

32:20.365 --> 32:21.593
Know how I'm gonna deal?

32:22.167 --> 32:25.102
I'm gonna stuff my pie hole,
I'm gonna drink.

32:25.437 --> 32:27.928
And I'm gonna watch
some Asian cartoon porn...

32:28.106 --> 32:31.303
...and act like the world
is about to explode because it is.

32:36.815 --> 32:39.249
Hey. You gotta be kidding me.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.649
"Massacre at the campaign office...

32:43.822 --> 32:47.121
...of an incumbent senator
by a trenchcoated man."

32:47.292 --> 32:48.486
There's security footage.

33:03.108 --> 33:07.943
Well, I think reaching Cass
is, uh, out of the cards.

33:23.295 --> 33:25.286
Hey, Castiel, um...

33:28.000 --> 33:29.160
Maybe this is pointless.

33:29.334 --> 33:33.395
Look, heh, I don't know
if any part of you even cares...

33:33.572 --> 33:39.738
...but, um, I still think
you're one of us deep down.

33:39.945 --> 33:43.676
I mean,
way, way, way off the reservation...

33:47.586 --> 33:50.521
...but, look,
we still have till dawn to stop this.

33:51.256 --> 33:52.985
Let us help.

33:53.325 --> 33:54.883
Please.

34:10.108 --> 34:11.837
Only if you turn that off.

34:22.054 --> 34:23.214
Sam?

34:25.556 --> 34:27.991
- Cass.
- I heard your call.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.893
I need help.

34:38.503 --> 34:40.630
We need the right blood.
There's a small jar.

34:40.806 --> 34:42.569
End of the hall, supply closet.

34:42.741 --> 34:44.264
Got it.

34:51.617 --> 34:53.141
Dean.

34:53.518 --> 34:55.645
- What, you need something else?
- No.

34:57.623 --> 34:58.954
I feel regret.

35:00.025 --> 35:02.994
About you and what I did to Sam.

35:03.161 --> 35:04.651
Yeah, well, you should.

35:06.632 --> 35:10.432
If there was time,
if I was strong enough, I'd fix him now.

35:12.304 --> 35:15.535
I just wanted to make amends
before I die.

35:16.642 --> 35:18.109
Okay.

35:21.413 --> 35:22.778
Is it working?

35:23.482 --> 35:25.074
Does it make you feel better?

35:25.751 --> 35:27.150
No.

35:29.588 --> 35:30.748
You?

35:30.922 --> 35:31.980
Not a bit.

35:38.296 --> 35:40.355
I know it all seems so silly, doesn't it?

35:41.933 --> 35:43.491
Hi, Sam.

35:44.002 --> 35:45.196
Long time no spooning.

35:46.004 --> 35:48.632
You're not here. You're in hell.

35:49.808 --> 35:51.366
Now, that...

35:51.576 --> 35:52.873
...you're right on.

35:57.582 --> 35:59.140
Meat hooks...

35:59.885 --> 36:01.477
...chains...

36:01.653 --> 36:02.779
...you.

36:04.456 --> 36:06.185
It's not real.

36:06.591 --> 36:12.188
It's just my brain leaking memories
from the cage.

36:12.364 --> 36:14.798
Because of the wall breaking down.

36:15.634 --> 36:17.192
That's all.

36:18.637 --> 36:21.367
Mm, that's very good,
your little theory.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.474
It's wrong.

36:24.109 --> 36:28.102
Sam, this isn't you going guano.

36:28.513 --> 36:30.037
Everything else is.

36:32.851 --> 36:35.843
- What?
- Everything.

36:36.021 --> 36:38.319
From the second
you sprung out of that lock box.

36:38.490 --> 36:39.684
- That's impossible.
- No.

36:39.858 --> 36:41.758
Escaping was impossible.

36:41.927 --> 36:44.054
I have to say...

36:44.496 --> 36:46.691
...I think this is my best torture yet.

36:47.165 --> 36:50.157
Make you believe that you're free,
and then:

36:51.369 --> 36:53.769
Yank the wool off of your eyes.

36:54.506 --> 36:55.996
You never left, Sam.

36:57.075 --> 36:58.406
You're still in the cage.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.005
With me.

37:11.757 --> 37:12.849
Hang in there.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.719
Just a couple of minutes.

37:15.660 --> 37:18.390
Where's Sam? It's go time.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.169
Sam?

37:34.980 --> 37:36.106
Damn it.

37:46.825 --> 37:48.486
That's good enough.

37:49.261 --> 37:50.592
Okay.

37:50.762 --> 37:51.922
Step right up, Cass.

38:22.994 --> 38:24.985
I'm sorry, Dean.

38:59.497 --> 39:01.021
Cass?

39:15.780 --> 39:17.543
He's cold.

39:18.717 --> 39:19.877
Is he breathing?

39:20.051 --> 39:21.143
No.

39:22.554 --> 39:24.215
Maybe angels don't need to breathe.

39:24.389 --> 39:26.323
He's gone, Dean.

39:37.802 --> 39:39.497
Damn it.

39:44.743 --> 39:46.438
Cass, you child.

39:46.611 --> 39:48.841
Why didn't you listen to me?

39:54.219 --> 39:55.311
Cass?

39:55.687 --> 39:58.019
Hey. Hey.

39:59.424 --> 40:01.517
Okay. All right.

40:03.595 --> 40:04.926
That was unpleasant.

40:05.764 --> 40:08.130
- Let's get him up.
- Easy there. Unh.

40:12.637 --> 40:14.400
I'm alive.

40:16.074 --> 40:17.871
Looks like.

40:18.410 --> 40:20.378
I'm astonished.

40:20.912 --> 40:22.971
Thank you. Both of you.

40:24.716 --> 40:27.651
We were mostly just trying
to save the world.

40:28.586 --> 40:30.486
I'm ashamed.

40:31.589 --> 40:32.647
I really overreached.

40:32.891 --> 40:34.449
- You think?
- I'm gonna find some way...

40:34.626 --> 40:36.491
...to redeem myself to you.

40:37.595 --> 40:40.996
Well, one thing at a time, come on.
Let's get you out of here, come on.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.430
I mean it, Dean.

40:44.402 --> 40:45.994
Okay.

40:46.171 --> 40:47.729
All right. Let's go find Sam.

40:47.906 --> 40:48.964
You need to run now!

40:50.909 --> 40:52.900
- I can't hold them back.
- Hold who back?

40:54.512 --> 40:55.809
They held on inside me.

40:57.749 --> 40:59.011
They're so strong.

40:59.184 --> 41:01.277
- Who the hell...?
- Leviathan.

41:04.322 --> 41:05.619
I can't fight them!

41:05.790 --> 41:06.950
Run!

41:08.259 --> 41:09.521
Go get Sam. Go get Sam.

41:11.963 --> 41:13.328
Too late.

41:13.498 --> 41:14.590
Cass?

41:16.601 --> 41:18.159
Cass is, hmm.

41:18.336 --> 41:21.430
He's gone. He's dead.

41:22.407 --> 41:23.704
We run the show now.

41:28.613 --> 41:29.807
Ah!

41:40.825 --> 41:45.353
Now, this is going to be so much fun.
