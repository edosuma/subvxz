Burt.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.662
What?
Don't.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.327
Why?

01:10.403 --> 01:11.927
Come back up here,
I want to kiss you.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.973
No, come on. I want to do this.
I'm staying down here.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.371
Okay.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.234
Just don't blow.
What?

01:20.046 --> 01:21.138
Don't blow.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.738
Why would I blow?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.807
I don't know why you do
anything you do, Burt.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.511
Just don't blow.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.721
Okay. Just stop
moving. Okay?
Okay.

01:29.789 --> 01:30.778
You'll love it.

01:30.857 --> 01:33.018

01:48.074 --> 01:49.063
Nothing.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.267
Why'd you stop?

01:51.344 --> 01:55.178
I'm just trying to figure out how
to say what I'm about to say.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.944
Why do you have
to say anything?

01:58.017 --> 02:01.783
You taste different.
Did you know that?

02:02.622 --> 02:05.420
No, Burt.
How would I know that?

02:05.492 --> 02:08.393
Just get up here. Okay?
I don't want to keep talking
to the top of your head.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.655
Do you want me to shower?
No, no.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.254
You don't taste dirty.
You just taste different.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.630
Like, kind of fruity.

02:14.701 --> 02:15.895
God.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.530
Wait. Did you know a woman can taste
different depending on various co-factors?

02:19.606 --> 02:20.630
I don't want to hear that.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.175
And I thought that we agreed you
wouldn't use the word "co-factors."

02:23.243 --> 02:24.835
No, I said I wouldn't misuse it.

02:24.911 --> 02:28.039
All I'm saying is, from what
I've read about vaginal flavor...

02:28.114 --> 02:30.173
Jesus!
...from what I've read,

02:30.250 --> 02:34.118
abrupt changes can happen when
a woman's either menopausal

(VERONA LAUGHS)

03:07.720 --> 03:12.783
I really want to be that dad that knows
how to make stuff out of wood. You know?

03:13.459 --> 03:18.158
I just want our kid to wake up in the morning
and walk out on the back porch

03:18.231 --> 03:20.927
and find me cobbling.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.761
You know, that's not what it's called.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.201
Yeah, it is.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.432
Burt, cobbling is shoes.

03:28.174 --> 03:31.871
That's why the people that make shoes
are called cobblers.

03:32.345 --> 03:35.041
You're not cobbling,
you're carving.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.912
Or possibly whittling.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.387
Good morning.
Morning.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.548
BURT: I got this great book on knots.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.649
300 knots, and I'm gonna
learn them all.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.992
And I still have to build that kiln.
Man, you gotta be ready.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.089
You remember, we go to your
parents' house this afternoon?

03:53.166 --> 03:57.398
Yeah, you know, I pushed that because
I have Family Defense class today.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.529
Yeah. Does everybody
there dress like that?

03:59.606 --> 04:01.233
Hey, where are those
goggles you had?

04:01.307 --> 04:02.797
My airbrush ones?
Yeah.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.570
You can't use them.
Got them.

04:04.644 --> 04:05.633
Burt.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.373
All right.
I will be back at 3:00.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.678
Maybe a little later if I get into
some hand-to-hand combat.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.581
Okay, bye.
Bye.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.496
VERONA: They look like the
California Raisins, remember?

and the sunglasses.

wish you could see this.

this uncool for the rest of my life?

You're talking to me 
while you're exercising?

No, I'm just watching it.

hematoma thing due Friday.

before we go out tonight.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.068
Dinner at Burt's parents'.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.262
Ooh!

05:05.438 --> 05:07.406
They must be
out-of-their-minds excited.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.565
Yeah, you know them.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.201
I think they're probably happy to be
the only set of grandparents

05:11.277 --> 05:13.006
and have the baby
to themselves.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.775
Don't say that. You're lucky
to have them so close.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.908
I know, I know.
We're gonna lean pretty hard on them.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.509

be able to entertain
herself outside.

it's that tilted uterus of yours.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.501
And now we can
finally do it.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.529
You're leaving a month
before the baby's born?

12:22.408 --> 12:27.175
You're moving 3,000 miles
away from your grandchild.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.111
I think it's more than
3,000, isn't it, Jerry?

12:30.182 --> 12:31.945
I think so.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.814
I can't believe this!

12:33.886 --> 12:35.114
There are planes, Burt.

12:35.187 --> 12:38.213
We've been planning this forever, folks.
You know that.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.451
I didn't know that.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.620
Wait, hold on a second.
How long are you gonna live there?

12:43.696 --> 12:44.754
GLORIA: Just 2 years. Okay?

12:44.830 --> 12:47.822
"Just 2 years"? You guys.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.425
Wait. Are you selling the house?

12:50.503 --> 12:53.472
See, that's the best part.
We were going to rent the house out

12:53.539 --> 12:56.474
with the help of a very elegant
gentleman named Fareed,

12:56.542 --> 12:58.009
but no one's come forward yet. So...

12:58.077 --> 13:00.068
Wait. How long have you
been planning this?

13:00.146 --> 13:02.671
Hold on. If we don't find
a renter in the next month,

13:02.748 --> 13:04.443
you two can stay here
while we're gone.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.747
You can have the house
for the next 2 years.

13:06.819 --> 13:07.979
Outstanding.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.577
(PHONE RINGING)

13:16.562 --> 13:18.962
GLORIA: Were
your ears burning?

13:19.031 --> 13:21.591
Your ears must
have been on fire, sir.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.032
What is that?

13:23.102 --> 13:24.126
Oh!

13:24.203 --> 13:28.435
Magnificent, isn't it?
I didn't think you'd notice. $12,000.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.108
I cannot believe it.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.543
I know.
She's a Choctaw princess, I'm told.

13:33.612 --> 13:37.810
I think it's important
that we honor our Indian...

13:37.883 --> 13:40.909
Indigent people...
Our ingenious...

13:42.087 --> 13:44.112
In-de-gentious people.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.555
Who was it?

13:48.627 --> 13:49.616
Nobody.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.789
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:54.266 --> 13:55.528
Was it... Was it Fareed?

13:55.601 --> 13:56.727
Later.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.531
Later.
Hmm.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.640
If it was Fareed,
did he...

14:01.707 --> 14:02.935
Yeah.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.908
He did? He...
Mmm-hmm.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.211
(SCREAMING)

14:11.383 --> 14:13.146
When?
The day we leave.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.880
Oh, my God!

14:15.521 --> 14:18.615
I guess we've got some
more news for you two.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.719
We could get someone else
to be the grandparents.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.457
Those old people, across the street,
what are their names?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.260
I mean, we moved
here for them.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.825
And now, they're gonna miss
the baby's first 2 years.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.995
It just really takes selfishness
to a whole new level.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.837
It's not like your parents
are doing anything.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.705
My parents are dead, Burt.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.750
Still.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.489
I can see my breath.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.120
Hold on, I'll get the thing.

14:57.196 --> 15:00.927
Make it nice and toasty.
There you go.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.467
(ELECTRICITY SURGES)

15:02.534 --> 15:04.263
God damn it.
Great.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.167
All I did
was turn it on.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.696
I even said to the guy at the store,
I said, "Could I have a red fuse?"

15:09.775 --> 15:10.969
He said, "You want a blue fuse."

15:11.043 --> 15:12.340
I said, "No, I already
had the blue fuse.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.847
"Didn't work out great.
So I'll take a red one."

15:15.915 --> 15:19.043
He's like, "Trust me,
it's the blue one." "Okay."

15:19.118 --> 15:22.554
Now we know who will be getting
a red fuse next time.

15:24.223 --> 15:28.353
Burt. You know, we don't have
to stay here.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.123
What?

15:31.830 --> 15:33.764
I'm saying we could leave, too.

15:33.832 --> 15:35.231
But we live here.

15:35.301 --> 15:39.237
I know, but the only reason that we're here
is because your parents are here.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.239
Or were here.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.469
Well, where would we go?

15:44.543 --> 15:46.807
I don't know.
We could go anywhere we want.

15:46.879 --> 15:47.937
Anywhere, anywhere?

15:48.013 --> 15:49.002
Yeah.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.810
I can do my job from anywhere.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.851
And all you need's a phone, right?

15:52.918 --> 15:55.352
Well, we don't want to go
back to Chicago, do we?

15:55.421 --> 15:57.321
No, we did Chicago.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.349
I used to picture myself in Alaska.
God, I love that landscape.

16:02.428 --> 16:03.952
Alaska?
Yeah.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.463
You've never mentioned Alaska.

16:07.366 --> 16:10.767
Wow, they pay people
to live in Alaska.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.060
Oh!

16:12.137 --> 16:16.836
Phoenix. We could
live near my sister.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.901
She could be Auntie Grace
all the time.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.312
Think of that, Burt.
That would make me so happy.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.746
And Lily and Lowell
live there.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.842
Who are Lily and Lowell?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.853
Lily, my old boss in Chicago.

16:28.921 --> 16:29.910
Right.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.551
What do you
think of that?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.694
Yeah, they could be
our friends in Phoenix.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.526
They weren't really
our friends in Chicago.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.261
I know, but they could be
when we live in Phoenix.

16:44.169 --> 16:48.606
They could be our new good friends
when we live in Phoenix.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.375
Well, we wouldn't need a
space heater in Phoenix.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.444
Burt, are we fuck-ups?

17:00.519 --> 17:01.508
No.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.686
What do you mean?

17:05.758 --> 17:07.726
I mean, we're 34.

17:07.792 --> 17:08.817
33.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.795
We don't even have this basic
stuff figured out.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.059
Basic, like how?

17:14.133 --> 17:15.998
Basic, like how to live.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.835
We're not fuck-ups.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.771
We have a cardboard window.

17:26.845 --> 17:29.006
We're not fuck-ups.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.444
(WHISPERING) I think
we might be fuck-ups.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.043
(WHISPERING)
We're not fuck-ups.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.532
Are we nuts?

17:52.604 --> 17:53.832
Well, look around.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.568
We both agree we need to be
near some kind of family.

17:56.642 --> 18:02.547
Some friends, something.
Some connection, someone we know, so...

18:02.614 --> 18:05.139
We'll look at Phoenix,
see my sister.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.445
Your closest friends.

18:06.518 --> 18:07.712
Lily and Lowell.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.720
And then to Madison
for your job interview.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.016
My what?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.785
God. Your interview.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.920
Your interview
with Mutual Choice.

18:15.994 --> 18:20.431
To see if they'll give you a better commission?
You set it up.

18:20.499 --> 18:23.093
Okay. So then from Madison, we go home.

18:23.168 --> 18:25.568
No. Did you look at the itinerary?

18:25.637 --> 18:28.003
I stapled it to the inside
of your jacket.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.339
See? From Madison,
we go to Montreal.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.935
Montreal is where I think we should
live if we don't live in Phoenix.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.810
Okay, Montreal.

18:37.349 --> 18:42.116
See? This is exciting,
if you think about it.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.883
We're completely
untethered, Burt.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.118
This is a dream scenario.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.063

And your face, it's so fat!

19:39.945 --> 19:42.345
Come here, give us a hug!

19:43.615 --> 19:47.745
Lowell, come and give a hug to the
most beautiful woman in the world.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.878
Look at that.
Nice to see you, Lowell.

don't be such a pill.

we didn't get into the club.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.217
Good, I was almost out.
I'll get an opener.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.856
Verona and I were
desk buddies in Chicago.

19:59.932 --> 20:05.029
I hired her at the agency.
That was before she
broke out on her own.

I still have no idea where you learned how
to paint the insides of dead people.

20:09.308 --> 20:13.870
So fucking disgusting, girlfriend!
Come on, let's get a drink.

20:50.382 --> 20:53.317
Well, thanks. We're gonna
do something about those ears.

You know what I mean?

with the arms on it.

that dyke look.

She walks like a teamster,
doesn't she?

21:09.167 --> 21:12.227

She's only 12, and I know she's a dyke.

go for that or not.

about it right in front of the children.

But it's mostly
insurance futures.
It's pretty cool, actually.

Similar to how an individual or
a family might get insurance,

22:33.385 --> 22:36.183
insurance companies
need insurance themselves.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.687
It's sort of this hedge against...

I don't think.

They sucked me dry.
I don't even need a bra.

Now I just tuck them into my socks.
You ready for that, Burt?

will finally get married?

24:02.908 --> 24:04.603
They're not married?
I told you that.

24:04.676 --> 24:07.702
Burt wants to, Verona doesn't
see the point.

24:07.779 --> 24:12.739
Insurance, for one. If anyone,
you should understand that, Bart.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.753
Anyone ever call you Bart?
It'd be kind of funny.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.789
We didn't have insurance
when Ashley was born.

24:17.856 --> 24:21.314
Well, we thought we did, and then
we didn't. And then I couldn't get it.

24:21.393 --> 24:25.386
Pre-existing condition.
I'm crazy!

24:27.566 --> 24:28.760
Look, whatever.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.301
I don't know. I...

24:30.368 --> 24:33.360
I guess I just never gave that much
thought to "marriage" marriage.

24:33.438 --> 24:36.430
Well, at the very least, it'll keep you from
taking off in the middle of the night

24:36.508 --> 24:37.532
when there's trouble.

24:37.609 --> 24:42.342
I almost left Lowell about a dozen times.
Kids don't know that.

24:42.414 --> 24:46.783
And then you start thinking about
the wedding and all that money...

24:46.852 --> 24:49.116
$46,000 for ours.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.512
(SIGHS)

24:50.589 --> 24:55.185
It was worth maybe
$31,000, $31,500.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.296
I hope you guys move here.

24:59.364 --> 25:02.094
We're having a hell of a time breaking
into the social world here.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.156
Really?

25:03.235 --> 25:04.702
It seems very cliquish.

25:04.769 --> 25:07.533
I don't know what it is.
We didn't get into the good golf club.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.006
There's no water left, anyway.

25:11.276 --> 25:15.303
The drought's coming.
Like the biblical flood, but in reverse.

25:16.448 --> 25:20.316
The golf course will be the first to go.
Then the fountains.

25:21.086 --> 25:25.489
All the water fountains.
The restaurants.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.284
Basic services.

25:30.629 --> 25:34.998
Large mammals.
Then regular-size mammals.

25:36.835 --> 25:39.770
Reptiles. Birds.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.004
Then people.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.072
You done?

25:54.686 --> 25:57.052
Thanks for treating.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.186
This was wonderful.
I so hope you move down here.

26:04.262 --> 26:07.356
This is the place for you guys.
It's so obvious.

26:07.432 --> 26:09.491
Don't listen
to anyone else.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.901
And I'm sorry I said anything
about the marriage stuff.

26:12.971 --> 26:13.960
No!

26:14.039 --> 26:15.097
No, you guys do
what you need to do.

26:15.173 --> 26:18.336
Your baby won't care.
Kids are resilient.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.776
And they're genetically
predetermined anyway.

26:20.845 --> 26:23.473
They're screwed up
out of the womb. So what?

26:23.548 --> 26:27.450
They'll have cell phones,
they'll be fine. Okay.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.281
It was so great
to see you.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.186
Bye, honey.
Bye.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.750
Bye.
Okay.

(SIGHS)

26:49.441 --> 26:50.908
Lowell!

27:01.987 --> 27:03.181
You don't agree
with them, do you?

27:03.254 --> 27:04.812
No.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.652
About what?

27:07.726 --> 27:12.595
That thing they said earlier, about
how you can't make a good family.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.529
Everything's destined for failure.

27:14.599 --> 27:15.998
No, I don't.

27:16.801 --> 27:20.100
You know that I don't
agree, Burt. I just...

27:20.171 --> 27:22.605
I really hate that attitude, you know?
"Everything's already broken,

27:22.674 --> 27:26.337
"so why don't we just keep on
breaking it again and again?"

27:30.849 --> 27:34.250
Hey, did you... Did you hear
what Lily said about her boobs?

27:34.319 --> 27:35.411
Mmm.

27:37.255 --> 27:39.120
Did you know Lily
when she had her boobs?

27:39.190 --> 27:41.158
Man, she was huge.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.324
Really?

27:45.397 --> 27:46.694
Enormous.

27:54.973 --> 27:58.704
But as long as the baby's
healthy, right?

28:12.691 --> 28:13.885

You're my light, Verona.

I can't wait
to see you as a mom.

(SNIFFLING)

28:39.250 --> 28:41.582

28:56.401 --> 28:58.596
What are we gonna do?

28:58.670 --> 28:59.932
What?

What are we gonna do?

29:04.309 --> 29:06.072
How do you mean?

29:10.248 --> 29:12.773
No one's in love
like us, right?

29:15.019 --> 29:19.183
It's so weird.
What are we gonna do?

29:28.199 --> 29:32.135
I think we just
gotta ride it out.

VERONA: Hey, listen, I need you to
concentrate for a second, okay?

30:22.453 --> 30:23.681
BURT: Okay.
VERONA: My sister's been dating

30:23.755 --> 30:26.724
this guy named Rob, who seems nice,
but she thinks he's boring.

30:26.791 --> 30:29.021
He likes going to steakhouses,
that kind of thing.

30:29.093 --> 30:30.492
Good afternoon, madam.
Hi.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.996
Wait, is that a good thing or
a bad thing, steakhouses?

30:33.064 --> 30:34.292
Bad. Anyway...

30:34.365 --> 30:35.559
Like an Outback Steakhouse?

30:35.633 --> 30:36.759
I'm not sure.

30:36.835 --> 30:37.995
Ruth's Chris Steakhouse?

30:38.069 --> 30:39.263
I honestly don't know.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.895
But we need to make
him seem cool.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.304
She loves you, Burt. She'll value
your endorsement of this guy.

30:43.374 --> 30:44.739
I got it.

30:44.809 --> 30:45.969
And don't look at her boobs.

BURT: No, I'm over it.
I was better last time.

30:48.713 --> 30:50.613
Yeah, but she's bigger now.
She went on the pill

30:50.682 --> 30:54.516
and she's been complaining about
getting new bras and everything.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.577
Wait a minute.
Why don't you go on the pill?

30:56.654 --> 30:58.645

That's right, this is a fern.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.356
What's that?
That's a cactus.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.561

of cactus, huh?

what you know about babies.

No. Go on, tell the
nice people what...

31:36.728 --> 31:39.424
Beckett, you're being rude.

31:39.497 --> 31:42.125
Babies like to breathe,
and they're good at hiding it.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.327
I put a pillow over a baby.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.927
I thought she wasn't
breathing, but she was.

or go out? Do you need to eat?

We don't want to go out there.

No, it's like an oven.

No, no, I mean,
literally, like an oven.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.675

that's what it would be like.

all down and make
something better.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.875
Wow, Burt.
That is so stoney.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.043
Well, it's just the Bible.

32:34.919 --> 32:35.943
QED.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.915
2 days ago, he asked me
if I liked music.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.923
Like music is something
people don't like?

32:39.991 --> 32:43.119
You know, he posed the question like
it was some great conversation-starter.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.560
"Grace, do you like music?"
It was painful.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.895
I don't know, I wish somebody would
ask me that sometime, you know?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.901
'Cause that's a probing sort
of intelligence, I think.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.368
Really?
Yeah.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.701
I mean, he doesn't assume the obvious.
He's a lawyer, right?

32:54.772 --> 32:56.239
A tax attorney.
Tax attorney, that's what I mean.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.172
So he's gotta be smart,
he's gotta be wily.

32:58.242 --> 32:59.607
He drives a cabriolet.

32:59.677 --> 33:04.546
A cabriolet, that's good design.
Good mileage.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.776
He uses the word "robust."

33:06.851 --> 33:09.649
That's because a lot
of things are robust.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.315
He took me
to Long John Silver's.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.119
I thought you said
it was a steakhouse.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.887
When I told him I didn't want
to go to the steakhouse,

33:15.960 --> 33:18.121
he took me to Long John Silver's.

and your desires.

from the doctor?

What? Really?

It's okay. You're supposed to
have a note from the doctor

if you want to fly
after 8 months.

38:14.325 --> 38:17.783

38:18.229 --> 38:19.253
Uh-huh.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.560
Carrie?
You got a minute?

38:24.669 --> 38:27.069
She says she's only 6 months.

38:28.272 --> 38:30.433
(SIGHS) Can you turn to the side?

38:32.109 --> 38:34.543
BURT: I think this is better, actually.

38:35.413 --> 38:40.146
This is the railroad.
The romance of the rails.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.113
'Rona, it's like Casey Jones
or Thomas the Train.

38:44.188 --> 38:47.021
Hey, you know what?
We might see some buffalo.

38:53.297 --> 38:55.663
I'm so tired of being big.

38:58.035 --> 39:00.663
I'm tired of not having sex.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.399
BURT: Do you want to have sex?

39:02.473 --> 39:03.633
No.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.568
We haven't done it in a month.

39:07.645 --> 39:09.613
And you don't want to now?

39:09.680 --> 39:10.669
VERONA: No.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.851
I just... I feel so ugly.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.762
No, no, no. Don't be sad.

39:28.699 --> 39:33.068
You're not that big.
You're still super-sexy.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.627
Hot, even.

39:36.407 --> 39:40.104
Oh! No. Honey... Hey.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.243
I'll always love you.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.786
Even if you're enormous.

39:51.989 --> 39:55.982
Even if it takes you months
to lose this weight. A year.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.891
Even if you gain weight
after having the baby.

40:00.631 --> 40:06.126
Even if you gain so much weight
that I can't find your vagina.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.736
(SCREAMING)

40:09.473 --> 40:13.239
You go ahead and write
that in stone in your heart.

40:14.512 --> 40:18.004
I will love you.

40:19.150 --> 40:24.213
(WHISPERING) Even if
I can't find your vagina.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.854
Her heart rate's pretty slow.

40:30.928 --> 40:31.917
What is it?

40:31.996 --> 40:33.258
It's like 115.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.524
That seems normal
enough, right?

40:34.598 --> 40:37.499
Well, it's supposed to be
between 120 and 160.

40:37.568 --> 40:40.128
She's just mellow.
Mellow's good.

40:40.204 --> 40:43.537
I don't want mellow now.
I want lively now, mellow later.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.767
I think it's fine.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.469
That's 'cause you
don't want to fight.

40:46.544 --> 40:49.377
We should fight more,
just get riled up.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.641
Didn't we fight last night?

40:50.714 --> 40:52.272
No, we discussed.

40:52.349 --> 40:55.443
We need to fight.
You never raise your voice.

40:56.153 --> 40:57.381
Okay.

40:59.957 --> 41:03.188
You've done something wrong,
and I'm really bothered by it.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.251
Man, am I cross.
Real mad.

41:05.329 --> 41:08.321
(LAUGHS) No, it has to be convincing.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.388
Like, should I swear?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.230
No, just raise your voice.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.202
(SHOUTS) You cuntsucker!

41:15.072 --> 41:16.562
I didn't mean now.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.370
But the element of surprise
is so crucial.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.604
You've never heard me say
"cuntsucker" before, have you?

41:21.679 --> 41:23.476
No.
See?

41:24.882 --> 41:28.545
And I will get that heart rate up.
I know what I'm doing.

41:33.691 --> 41:36.353
VERONA: Wow, look at this.
This is really nice.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.792
BURT: Yeah, it is.

41:38.829 --> 41:43.493
So, is Ellen a full
professor or an associate?

41:43.567 --> 41:46.331
And wait, which side is she on?
She's a first cousin, right?

41:46.403 --> 41:49.372
She's not technically
my cousin, actually.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.206
Her mom was an old friend of my dad's.
I've no idea how.

41:54.044 --> 41:56.638
Anyway, they started calling us
cousins when we were kids.

41:56.714 --> 41:59.945
BURT: She always used to make me
take pictures of her.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.041
Excuse me.
Yes?

42:01.118 --> 42:03.484
Do you know where Ellen
Fisher-Herrin's office is?

42:03.554 --> 42:06.853
Ellen Fisher-Herrin.
Yes, I do know.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.721
As a matter of fact,
she's in William Stone Hall.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.817
Room 340, about halfway down.

42:10.895 --> 42:12.829
Thanks.
Yeah.

42:12.897 --> 42:15.627
She'll be the mom
without the stroller.

42:17.935 --> 42:19.334
She doesn't have a stroller?

42:19.403 --> 42:21.633
I thought you said she got
some sort of big trust fund.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.674
She did. Oh! Here it is.

42:26.410 --> 42:29.504
I thought her name was Ellen.
What does "L-N" stand for?

42:29.580 --> 42:31.013
(GASPS) No!

42:32.216 --> 42:34.343
Don't say anything. Please.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.113
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

42:36.253 --> 42:37.550
LN: It's open.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.013
LN: Here we go.

42:42.593 --> 42:44.060
Hello.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.323
Welcome.

42:47.131 --> 42:49.156
LN: Come on in.
Come on in.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.232
Come on in. Okay.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.269
Okay.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.800
Mama's gonna put
her booby back in.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.807
(WHISPERING) All right.

43:03.681 --> 43:07.173
I'll give it right back.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.384
So great to have you.
It's good to see you. Hi.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.580
How are you?

43:14.658 --> 43:16.057
I'm good. I'm good.

43:16.126 --> 43:17.320
You remember Verona?

43:17.394 --> 43:18.418
Hi.

43:18.495 --> 43:19.860
Of course.

43:20.030 --> 43:24.330
How can I forget
such a gorgeous woman?

43:24.401 --> 43:26.801
Oh! Verona,
you just look beautiful.

43:26.870 --> 43:27.859
Thanks.

43:28.839 --> 43:30.773
Look at your hair.

43:32.810 --> 43:34.368
Yeah.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.937
And, well, it's a boy.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.544
A girl.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.606
No.

43:41.318 --> 43:46.517
Really? With those hips and that shape?
Who told you it was a girl?

43:48.125 --> 43:51.788
Well, the doctor and the sonogram...

43:51.862 --> 43:52.886
Well, we'll see.

43:52.963 --> 43:53.952
Right.

43:54.665 --> 43:55.757
LN: Should we go?

43:55.833 --> 43:57.130
Yes.

43:57.201 --> 43:58.793
BURT: Sorry we're late.
I tried to call.

43:58.869 --> 44:02.771
Oh! Right. Yeah, I don't answer
the phone when I'm nursing.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.171
It's not fair to the children.

44:04.241 --> 44:06.835
I gotta get this one to crafting.

44:08.879 --> 44:11.609
We got directions from this really
nice lady who seemed to know you.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.674
She was... Had brown hair,
wearing a blazer and glasses.

44:14.752 --> 44:15.741
She had a baby.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.252
LN: Ruby. Oh!

44:17.321 --> 44:20.518
Poor Ruby. She hates me.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.058
I breastfed her baby.

44:22.126 --> 44:23.593
Pardon?
Can you do that?

44:23.661 --> 44:27.062
Well, I was baby-sitting and
the child was fussing. Starving.

44:27.131 --> 44:31.500
Wouldn't take the bottle. So I fed him,
and he took to me right away.

44:31.568 --> 44:35.595
But, you know, I think my mistake was...
I shouldn't have told her.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.404
She's got lactation problems,
and she couldn't appreciate it.

44:39.476 --> 44:42.741
And now she won't let me baby-sit,
she won't let me near her husband,

44:42.813 --> 44:47.750
and I think there's something
strangely paranoid about that, right?

44:49.753 --> 44:53.484
So, dinner. Should we go out,
or do you want to eat in?

44:53.590 --> 44:56.184
Let's eat in.
We've had train food all day.

44:56.260 --> 44:57.750
(GROANS) Train food.

44:58.595 --> 45:00.529
Okay, let me think.
What do I have?

45:00.597 --> 45:02.758
Let us get the food.
We have a car.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.063
We can get the groceries.
I mean, it's the least that we can do.

45:05.135 --> 45:08.696
Look at you, so helpful.

45:08.772 --> 45:12.139
Oh, Burtie.
I'm really proud of you, babe.

45:13.544 --> 45:17.275
And I have to say I'm so glad
you guys got pregnant so easily.

45:17.347 --> 45:20.441
I was concerned when I heard
about your tilted uterus.

45:26.290 --> 45:28.656
VERONA: You told her
I have a tilted uterus?

45:28.726 --> 45:30.626
I don't know.
Maybe it was my mom.

45:30.694 --> 45:32.218
Is your tilted uterus a secret?

45:32.296 --> 45:34.924
Yeah, my tilted uterus
is a fucking secret.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.730
Oh, really,
you fucking bitch!

45:38.802 --> 45:41.532
(SHOUTING) Your fucking uterus
is a motherfucking secret?

45:41.605 --> 45:42.731
Well, fuck you!

45:49.747 --> 45:52.841
VERONA: You know, it was really nice of you
to think of getting them a stroller.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.749
BURT: Yeah. I had no idea how
expensive it would be.

45:55.819 --> 45:56.808
VERONA: I told you.

45:56.887 --> 45:58.514
No, like, really expensive.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.578
I know.

45:59.656 --> 46:01.920
Well, let me just hide this.
There we go.

46:01.992 --> 46:03.425
You ready?
Yeah.

46:03.894 --> 46:05.555
(DOORBELL BUZZES)

46:05.829 --> 46:08.354
You think we got them a good one?

Hi.
Hi.

46:11.568 --> 46:13.331
(GREETING IN HINDI)

46:13.403 --> 46:14.427
(VERONA GREETING IN HINDI)

46:14.505 --> 46:15.836
You, too.

46:17.374 --> 46:20.207
Oh, fabulous. Great.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.643
If you don't mind, there are
slippers just there.

46:23.147 --> 46:24.341
Just any of these?

46:24.414 --> 46:25.813
LN: Uh-huh.

46:42.499 --> 46:43.932
I like those.

46:46.170 --> 46:47.228
(WHISPERING)
Go get the stroller.

46:47.304 --> 46:48.293
(WHISPERING) Okay.

46:56.013 --> 46:58.504
We brought you something.

46:59.683 --> 47:01.776
Oh, my God. How...

47:06.223 --> 47:07.349
Oh, my God.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.361
(EXHALES) Okay,
all right, I'm sorry.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.395
Why don't we just
put it on the porch?

47:21.405 --> 47:22.565
Okay.

47:24.608 --> 47:26.041
They had it in blue. But...

47:26.109 --> 47:27.337
(LAUGHS)

47:38.422 --> 47:40.049
Just a little further away.

47:46.296 --> 47:47.285

47:47.865 --> 47:48.854
All right, come on.

47:48.932 --> 47:50.490
Okay.

47:50.567 --> 47:52.626
Let's go upstairs
and meet Roderick.

47:53.070 --> 47:54.059
Okay.

47:57.507 --> 47:58.974
Hello.

47:59.176 --> 48:00.541
(SHUSHING)

48:09.052 --> 48:10.280
Honey.

48:17.794 --> 48:18.886
Hi.

48:18.962 --> 48:19.986
Hey.

48:20.697 --> 48:21.686
I don't think we've met.

48:21.765 --> 48:23.426
Oh, yes, we have.

48:24.434 --> 48:27.096
Burning Man, '97.

48:31.675 --> 48:33.006
This is a big bed.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.903
We are a Continuum home.

48:37.180 --> 48:39.944
VERONA: What is that?
Continuum?

48:40.017 --> 48:41.143
Continuum?

48:41.218 --> 48:42.242
VERONA: Yes.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.954
Continuum.

48:45.022 --> 48:46.011
Yes.

48:47.391 --> 48:50.451
(SOFTLY) The Continuum
movement recognizes that

48:50.527 --> 48:55.829
the world will give your baby plenty of
alienation and despair in good time,

48:55.899 --> 48:58.197
so while we can, we should
hold them close.

48:58.268 --> 49:03.535
So, it's the 3 "S's," no separation,
no sugar, no strollers.

49:05.309 --> 49:07.004
They gave us a stroller.

Oh!

49:08.145 --> 49:09.578
(SNICKERING)

49:10.213 --> 49:11.680
What is wrong with strollers?

49:12.749 --> 49:16.810
Burts, I love my babies.

49:16.887 --> 49:19.879
Why would I want to push them
away from me?

49:21.291 --> 49:25.284
And you wonder why this country
is so dysfunctional.

49:25.362 --> 49:26.829
Because of strollers?

49:26.897 --> 49:28.762
Mama,

49:28.832 --> 49:32.199
in this house
we carry our babies.

49:32.569 --> 49:34.662
We hold them close.

49:34.738 --> 49:35.898
What about sleeping?

49:37.774 --> 49:40.937
This is where they sleep.
We practice family bed.

49:41.478 --> 49:45.346
So what if the two
of you want to,

49:45.415 --> 49:47.110
you know? Be alone?

49:47.985 --> 49:50.453
Do you go out to the car?

49:51.321 --> 49:53.152
No, Verona.

49:53.890 --> 49:55.380
We don't go out to the car.

49:56.994 --> 50:00.054
Are you planning on hiding
your lovemaking from your kids?

50:01.932 --> 50:03.490
Are you guys making love?

50:04.935 --> 50:07.062
It can be so great in the 6th month.

50:07.137 --> 50:08.161
Hmm.

50:08.238 --> 50:11.036
And it is so important to expose
your kids to sexuality,

50:11.108 --> 50:13.076
especially in utero.

50:13.143 --> 50:16.169
Do you know what
it does to a child

50:16.246 --> 50:18.680
to have their parents' expression
of love kept a secret?

50:19.216 --> 50:20.205
No.

50:20.283 --> 50:22.410
Oh! Well,

50:22.986 --> 50:24.613
that's why I have an Electra complex.

50:24.688 --> 50:26.246
Oh, babe.

50:26.790 --> 50:29.190
It is okay.

50:29.259 --> 50:31.090
(WHISPERING)
Which one's that, again?

50:31.161 --> 50:34.096
I think that is when a woman
wants to do her father.

50:34.798 --> 50:37.096
Do you mean "Oedipal complex"?

50:38.535 --> 50:41.936
Don't... Don't try
and diagnose me, Verona.

50:43.573 --> 50:45.871
Why the seahorses, Rod?

50:45.942 --> 50:47.842
In the seahorse community,

50:49.946 --> 50:51.709
the males give birth.

50:52.749 --> 50:57.777
The female inserts her ovipositor
into the male's brood pouch.

50:58.321 --> 51:00.482
That's where she
deposits her eggs.

51:00.557 --> 51:02.252
If I could,

51:03.627 --> 51:07.085
I would lay my eggs
in your brood pouch.

51:07.164 --> 51:08.688
I know you would.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.730
Don't...

51:15.105 --> 51:18.563
Don't, don't, don't.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.352
So, have you chosen a doula?

51:30.420 --> 51:33.048
I already had one.
A little weird, but good.

51:33.123 --> 51:35.353
A doula, Burtie, not a dolma.

51:35.425 --> 51:36.824
(ALL LAUGH)

51:36.893 --> 51:38.827
We are not using a doula.

51:38.895 --> 51:41.295
Really?
Who is your midwife?

51:41.531 --> 51:45.661
Oh, no, no. Midwives and doulas are
for when the husband is clueless

51:45.735 --> 51:46.724
or doesn't want to be involved.

51:46.803 --> 51:49.271
And I'm neither of those things.

51:49.339 --> 51:51.307
I'm really looking
forward to being involved.

51:51.374 --> 51:54.400
That's great, Burtie. I totally understand,
and I think that's great,

51:54.478 --> 51:57.606
but don't you think Verona
might want someone there

51:57.681 --> 52:00.616
who really understands
the female experience?

52:00.684 --> 52:04.245
Oh! There's this great
Simone de Beauvoir quote.

52:04.321 --> 52:05.913
I can't remember the book,
but I'll find it for you.

52:05.989 --> 52:10.983
It's something like, "One is not born,
but becomes, a woman."

52:13.096 --> 52:14.188
What does that have to do with...

52:14.264 --> 52:15.561
But it is worth it.

52:15.665 --> 52:19.032
The pain is so enlightening.
And now, having experienced childbirth,

52:19.102 --> 52:23.300
I watch CNN and I really
feel like I understand war.

52:24.341 --> 52:28.869
On top of which, when I had Wolfie,
I had the most enormous orgasm.

52:29.279 --> 52:31.247
It was so beautiful.

52:35.952 --> 52:37.977
This soup is delicious.

52:38.054 --> 52:43.651
Alice Walker said, "There's nothing more
important than how we enter this world."

52:43.727 --> 52:45.718
And I agree with her.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.990
And my mom had a hospital birth.

52:48.064 --> 52:51.556
The stirrups, the machines,
the drugs.

52:52.269 --> 52:56.831
(CHUCKLES) And she wonders why I can't
walk into a dry cleaner's without vomiting.

52:57.807 --> 53:02.176
Okay, can that maybe be the last bit
of parental advice we get tonight?

53:02.245 --> 53:03.837
Just a... Just a thought.

53:04.381 --> 53:08.943
Honey? Are you counting on this job
interview tomorrow?

53:09.019 --> 53:10.418
Where is it?

53:10.487 --> 53:12.887
Mutual Choice.
No, not really.

53:13.557 --> 53:14.546
Because I'm already doing fine.

53:14.624 --> 53:17.115
This would just be
a better commission rate.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.526
(SNICKERS)
Commission rate.

53:21.798 --> 53:25.097
What is it again, exactly,
that you do, Rod?

53:25.168 --> 53:28.535
What do you mean?
How do I "make my living"?

53:28.605 --> 53:29.765
Yes. That's exactly
what I mean.

53:29.839 --> 53:32.239
Don't worry, Wolf. You won't ever
have to do anything like that.

53:32.309 --> 53:34.277
Like... "Anything like that"?
Roderick...

53:34.945 --> 53:36.310
Like fearmongering.

53:36.379 --> 53:37.403
Fearmongering?

53:37.480 --> 53:39.004
Or skimming.
Roderick, honey?

53:39.082 --> 53:40.106
Cajoling? Billing?

53:40.183 --> 53:41.172
Roderick...

53:41.251 --> 53:42.479
Are you being serious?

53:42.552 --> 53:43.849
Roderick, Roderick.

53:43.920 --> 53:46.912
It's so easy to forget how great
the economic divide is these days.

53:46.990 --> 53:49.481
These guys have nothing.

53:49.559 --> 53:52.255
How should we expect them to
know anything about anything?

53:52.329 --> 53:54.490
And Verona lost her parents.

53:56.466 --> 53:59.196
Honey, how old were you
when they died?

53:59.970 --> 54:01.870
22. Why?

54:01.938 --> 54:03.462
Oh, you poor thing.

54:03.540 --> 54:07.670
I was just wondering how much your
mama was able to pass on to you

54:07.744 --> 54:09.712
about motherhood before she died.

54:09.779 --> 54:13.271
Your people have such a wonderful
oral tradition.

54:13.350 --> 54:16.410
Okay, that's it!
That's it!

54:16.486 --> 54:21.389
You are a terrible person.
Did you know that?
You are terrible people.

54:21.458 --> 54:24.916
And Verona? She is twice
the woman that you'll ever be!

I never... I'm sorry because...

to you Looney Tunes, just forget it.

shitty stroller with you.

Honey, what are you doing?

55:12.409 --> 55:14.400
Hey, Wolfie.
Want to get in the stroller?

55:14.477 --> 55:15.739
Wolfie, you... No...

55:15.812 --> 55:17.279

until you discover oral pleasure!

they have in Montreal?

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:15.491
Hell, yeah!

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.589
(WHOOPING)

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.031
You guys!
That is wonderful!

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.898
Let us toast.
Does anyone know a toast?

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:25.029
Okay. So, yay for Burt
and Verona moving here,

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:26.905
probably, if they are not stupid.

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.409
Yay!
Yay!

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.236
Oh!

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:33.839
2 more of these?
I love this...

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.781
Trombone, man.
I love the trombone.

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.717
I was just about to say that!
It is amazing, right?

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.844
The 'bone!

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.815
We don't know, actually.
We weren't 100% trying.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.723
I mean, we wanted
to have a baby.

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:47.922
It just sort of came
ahead of schedule.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.723
Have you had any
problems so far?

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:54.726
No. No. Not so far.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.938
It's been great.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.165
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:02.070
That's wonderful. That's...

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.642
Ladies, I have an announcement.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.047
(LAUGHING)

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:11.178
We need real food.

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.752
She said, "Mrs. Farlander,
your husband requests..."

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.054
What do you mean,
"Mrs. Farlander"?

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.958
You're still not married?
No.

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.757
We talked about this.
We talked about this.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:22.855
No. Why don't you propose?

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:24.024
When are you going to propose?

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.124
Propose?

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:27.567
All I do is propose.
Are you kidding?

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.635
Watch this. Watch. Watch this.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.335
Verona.
Yeah?

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.636
You really are
the love of my life.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.143
Thanks, honey.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.543
Will you marry me?
No.

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:39.839
Wow.
What?

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.577
That actually stings.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.243
Is this true?

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:44.786
It's you who's behind this.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.048
I can't see the point.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.248
That's romantic.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.757
MUNCH: Well, there isn't any,
really. I mean...

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.192
Well, not unless you have parents
who care one way or the other.

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.853
Which you don't.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.831
But your wedding
was so good.

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.059
Really good.
Yeah, it was.

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:00.694
It was really good. The wedding
was good. Marriage is great.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:05.173
But what you need to be happy,
and sane, is this.

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.074
What is that?
This?

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:12.375
Okay, watch this.
Here is you 2 guys.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.472
VERONA: Really?

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:14.538
No...

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.016
Okay, here is you 2 guys.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.074
Stop.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.287
Okay, so you kiss, you do other things
and then you make a baby.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.753
The baby comes in there
and he nestles in.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:28.661
And you guys hug and get real tight.
And then we do this.

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:32.599
And this. There...

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.059
And this...
Are those the bedposts?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:39.034
It's your house.
Now what is this?

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.273
Is that a home? Is that a family?
BURT: Yeah.

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.108
No. No, of course not.
That's just the raw material.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.910
The people, the walls, the furniture.
Okay, so that's the basics.

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.577
But that's not a home.
That's not a family.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.984
What binds it all together is this.

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.386
Awesome. That's awesome.

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.515
This is love.
BURT: I knew it.

01:04:58.361 --> 01:04:59.953
Yes, here we go.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.254
This is your love, guys.

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:05.664
Here it comes. The patience, your
consideration, your better selves.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.226
Man, you just have no idea
how good you can be.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.431
But you have to use all of it.
All of it.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.937
It's not like simple masonry,

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.374
where you use a little layer of mortar
between each row of bricks.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:16.434
No. With this,
you have to use tons of it.

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:19.242
For every brick, there's
a half-ton of mortar.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.776
I thought we were doing syrup.

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:26.278
Mortar, syrup. Syrup, mortar.
It is all the same. It's the glue.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.587
It's all those good
things you have in you.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.487
The love,

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:35.061
the wisdom, the generosity.
The selflessness.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:37.998
The patience. Patience.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:41.503
At 3:00 a.m., when everyone's
awake because Ibrahim is sick

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.664
and he can't find the bathroom and
he just puked in Katya's bed.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.901
Patience when you blink...
It was awful.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.879
When you blink and it's 5:30
and it is time to get up again,

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:55.008
and you know you're going to be tired
all day, all week, all your fucking life.

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.450
And you are thinking,
"What happened to Greece?

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.421
"What happened to swimming naked
off the coast of Greece?"

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:08.620
And you have to be willing to make
the family out of whatever you have.

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:15.193
You have to be so much
better than you ever thought.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.034
Right?

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:22.804
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.607
Wow, I've never
done this before.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.811
It's like dance karaoke?

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:28.406
It's Montreal.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.782
World capital of this kind of shit.

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.480
Montreal, baby.

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:35.615
Oh! Now listen, are there going to be any...
Is this just dudes?

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.750
No, no, no. It's not that those
guys weren't enjoyable.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.226
No, plenty of girls coming.
I swear.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.284
Okay.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:43.027
I hope so.
No, there's girls coming.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.624
Where's 'Rona?

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.724
BURT: I think
she's in the bathroom.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:46.995
Where's Munch?

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:48.559
I have no fucking idea.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:49.626
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.138
BURT: Uh-oh.

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:25.134
She had another miscarriage.

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.637
What?

01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:31.880
When?

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:32.936
TOM: Thursday.

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:36.181
This Thursday?

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.241
Yeah.

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:41.453
This is her 5th.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:49.892
I know she loves all those kids like
they were her own blood,

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:55.603
but I wonder if we
have been selfish.

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:58.037
People like us,
we wait until our 30s,

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:02.567
and then we are surprised when the
babies aren't so easy to make anymore.

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:08.982
And every day another million 
14-year-olds get pregnant without trying.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:17.685
It's terrible feeling this helpless, man.

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:24.625
You just watch these babies grow,
and then...

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.671
Then fade.

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:40.006
And you don't know if you're
supposed to name them

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:42.307
or bury them, or...

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.389
I'm sorry.

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.550

BURT: Well, you have
every right to be pissed.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.546
Or worse.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.659
Yeah...
Damn right, I'll be there.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.921
You're my brother,
for God's sake. Come on.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:04.163
This afternoon.
Yeah, well, we're leaving
as soon as 'Rona wakes up.

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:10.065
No, will you stop?
Hey, you're always paying, all right?

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:12.164
I'll pay. I can swing it.

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:14.408
Wait, hold on a second.
I think she is up.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:17.402
What's going on?
It's my brother.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.777
I'm telling her right now.
Helena left him.

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:20.872
What?

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.144
We're going to Miami.

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:24.878
What happened?

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:41.696
I spy with my little eye

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.830
something that is blue.

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.768
You... You didn't see
this coming, did you?

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.208
I mean,
she was normal, right?

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.371
Oh, yeah.
Definitely. Yeah.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.374
Do you have any idea how many times
I've checked my messages?

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.384
It's a tick now.
It's, like, 10 times an hour.

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:59.080
I've got all the lines
bouncing to my cell.

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:02.783
The weird thing is,
part of me is so angry,

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:04.689
I never want to hear
her name again.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.352
But if she came back tomorrow
and said she was sorry,

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:09.522
I would be so
fucking relieved.

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:10.989
(SIGHS)

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.590
Well, Annabelle seems
to be doing great.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.433
COURTNEY: I know.
It's even weirder.

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:16.835
BURT: Well, what did you tell her?

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.600
COURTNEY: I told her
it was a business trip.

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:21.108
I made the mistake of
telling her she'd be 5 days.

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:22.734
I actually thought that
was a conservative estimate.

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.574
I thought I would have
it figured out by then.

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.373
(SIGHS) But then 5 days go by and
she wants to know where her mom is.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.577
So I told her that Grandpa died.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:31.677
You told her Dad died?

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.517
No, no, no, Helena's father.

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:34.578
Oh!

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.681
Listen, Burt,

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:39.822
I really need your help.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:42.489
I mean, if she's
really gone for good,

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:44.259
I gotta know
what to tell Belle.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:47.427
And it is wrong to say that her mom
was murdered, right?

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.804
Yes. I think that
would be traumatic.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.632
Yeah, but there's finality there.

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:40.852
Good night, chicken.

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:45.691
Could you stay a little longer?

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:46.750
Sure.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.557
I'll stay with you.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:55.998
<i>VERONA: (SINGING) Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man

01:12:56.305 --> 01:13:02.335
<i>I'm not sleepy and there is no place
I'm going to</i>

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.770
<i>Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man</i>

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:06.212
Thank you.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.374
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:15.048
In the jingle jangle morning
I'll come followin' you

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.558
Did you see this?
What's that?

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.387
Oh, wow!
Look at that.

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.495
Man, she is so cute.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.555
COURTNEY: Yeah.

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:27.501
She just took that on Monday.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.434
Remember when we had to wait
weeks for the school pictures?

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.336
Oh, yeah. It was...

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:36.970
Hey. What's that on her lip?

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.782
Carrot juice.

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.218
Carrot juice.

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:47.152
Yeah, so that's the picture.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.121
(SIGHS)
Oh!

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:56.831
Yeah, I didn't see the carrot juice on
her mouth when she left the house.

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:59.661
I'm never going to see stuff like that.

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:05.004
Moms see the carrot juice
on their daughters' mouths.

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:08.038
Moms know when they
aren't dressed right.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:13.441
Moms go shopping with them, and make
sure their hair doesn't look all spazzy.

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.312
In one fell swoop,
Helena has changed

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.477
this girl's life
from a normal one,

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:19.885
where she can be
popular and all that,

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:23.652
to the distinct likelihood that she's
going to be introverted.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:26.283
A poor dresser.

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:31.298
One of those kids
that looks all longingly

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:34.824
at the girls with the new shoes
and the right backpack.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.600
Well, at least it's just
carrot juice, right?

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:44.071
I mean, it's not whiskey or glue.

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:46.711
It's just the beginning, though.

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:53.380
I'm going to be spending every waking
moment trying to reconstruct a normal life.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:15:01.555
But that little girl in there will always
be the girl without a mom.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:06.631
<i>VERONA: (SINGING) Into my own parade
cast your dancing spell my way</i>

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:10.297

<i>In the jingle jangle morning

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.434
BURT: Yeah? Well, the fact that
I'm even calling this late

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.633
means it's important, doesn't it?

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.970
I think so.

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:52.641
What's your name?
I already know, 'cause I...
Listen, you know what?

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:55.447
Well, I think you know more than
you're letting on. How about that?

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:56.506
Burt?

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:58.416
So... Hello?

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.478
Burt.
Damn it!

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.990
Burt, what are you doing?

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.719
Calling everyone she knew.

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.488
Her old company. Her friends.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.029
VERONA: At midnight?

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.291
Right.
The element of surprise.

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.990
Well, can you stop, please?

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:16.435
I mean, what kind of goddamned
person leaves her daughter?

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:19.941
I don't know. Maybe not such
a strong person. Please stop.

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:21.566
And you know what
the worst of it is?

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:23.508
There is nothing we can do about it.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:27.606
Because she is gone. And this family
can't be fixed. And that is it.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.082
And what if one of us
freaks out like that?

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:30.516
We won't.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.952
It can be fixed.
And you know it.

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.855
Thank you.

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:38.621
(GRUNTS)

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:42.921
Burt.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.129
It's okay.

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:51.066
Look at me, please.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:53.938
But really?

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:59.276
I mean, what if something
happens to one of us
and just makes us go crazy?

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:04.178
I mean, what if I'm walking by a
construction site and something falls,

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:08.018
and then my frontal lobe gets chopped
off and my personality's altered

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.251
and then I'm not a good dad?

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.651
What happens then?

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:16.027
Well, be careful walking near
construction sites.

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:19.556
What about Munch?

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:22.799
She'll be careful walking
near construction sites, too.

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.303
No, really.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.371
I mean, don't you just look at her
and want to give her

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.842
everything that
she's ever wanted?

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.444
It is so incredibly
unfair that she can't...

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.608
Yeah, you're right.

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:39.287
It's unfair that
she can't have a baby

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:43.518
and that bad parents
still get to be parents

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:48.495
and good parents die when their
daughters are in college. So what?

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.225
I'm sorry, 'Rona.

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:54.166
Look, all we can do is be good
for this one baby.

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:58.698
We don't have control
over much else.

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:02.634
Will you marry me?
At least.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.641
Never.

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.484
I will never leave you.
Yeah.

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.024
I promise.

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:23.291
No, I know.

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.434
You...

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:33.198
You promised never to marry me
because you don't want to get married

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:35.971
without your parents there.
I get that.

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.074
You promise
never to leave me.

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:46.615
Do you promise to never leave
this baby that we are having?

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.185
I promise.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:53.788
I do.

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:59.293
Do you promise

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:07.772
to stop talking about your ability to find
or not find my vagina after I give birth?

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:12.437
I do.

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:18.612
Do you promise
to let me cobble...

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:19.711
Carve.

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:23.246
...to carve in my spare time,

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.586
and teach our daughter the lore
of the great Mississippi?

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.423
I do.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.868
Do you promise never to
develop a thing for seahorses?

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.267
I do.

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.268
Good.

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.108
(EXHALES)

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:54.815
Do you promise to let our
daughter be fat or skinny

01:19:55.824 --> 01:20:00.056
or any weight at all? Because we want
her to be happy, no matter what.

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:04.496
Being obsessed with weight is just
too cliché for our daughter.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.827
Yes, I do.

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:12.497
Do you promise, when she talks,

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:17.209
you'll listen?
Like, really listen,

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.710
especially when she's scared?

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.646
And that her fights
will be your fights?

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.316
I do.

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:41.699
And do you promise that if I die some
embarrassing and boring death

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:46.469
that you're gonna tell our daughter
that her father was killed

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:51.410
by Russian soldiers in this intense
hand-to-hand combat

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:57.076
in an attempt to save the lives
of 850 Chechnyan orphans?

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.514
I do.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.014
Chechnyan orphans. I do.

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:06.753
I do.

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.146
We had an orange tree.

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.748
Who?

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:37.944
When we were kids.

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:42.014
My dad was really
proud of it.

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:47.860
He planted it one spring, and he used to
go out there first thing every morning,

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:50.489
see if any oranges had grown.
But nothing ever grew.

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.897
The thing was sickly or something,
or the soil wasn't right.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:02.302
One morning, my mom woke Grace
and me up really early,

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.776
like, at 5:00,

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:10.780
and she led us out to the tree with these
2 grocery bags filled with oranges,

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:15.545
and pineapples and grapes
and melons, for some reason.

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:21.488
And we just hung all the fruit from
the tree using tape and string.

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.824
It worked, actually.

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:29.732
And then we all ran into the truck
and we slouched down

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:32.272
and we just waited
for my dad to come out.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.398
What did he say?

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.943
Well, he stared
at it for a full minute,

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.776
just staring at it.

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:44.818
I think at first
he thought they were real,

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:47.047
like the tree had burst
into fruit overnight,

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:53.425
and then, I guess he saw the
pineapples or something,

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:59.926
and he just started laughing harder
than we'd ever heard him laugh.

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:06.068
And Grace and I just ran
out of the truck, squealing.

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:09.937
And my mom just...

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.846
And from then on,

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:25.289
every once in a while one of us
would hang fruit from there.

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:30.797
Usually something plastic, like pears

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:34.832
or strawberries or bananas.

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.666
BURT: Is this starting

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:17.537
VERONA: I think so.
God, I want it to.

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.910
But I want it to be new.
You know?

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:21.812
New for us.

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:25.608
New enough to feel like we found it.

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.920
Does that make sense?

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:30.850
Yeah.

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.432
You ready?

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:22.502
I am.

01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:24.939
Are you?

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.546
Yes, I am.

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:48.932
