02:02.818 --> 02:04.080
Thank you.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.778
You are applauding yourselves.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.085
I want you to spin the world map
and I want you to stop it.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.827
And you look at that nation,
and it's Africa.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.568
And it's shaped
like the question mark,

02:13.611 --> 02:16.527
but the thing is, it's Africa
that has all the answers.

02:16.571 --> 02:19.095
Africa is the motherland.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.664
It is where all of
God's creations were given life.

02:22.707 --> 02:26.494
Don't... Don't be fooled
by the white pigmentation.

02:26.537 --> 02:29.018
I am, we all are...

02:29.975 --> 02:32.978
Black and African by creation!

02:33.022 --> 02:35.677
-This is a thank you
for feeling this.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.550
Yes!

02:45.252 --> 02:47.471
There's a "help wanted"
sign outside. You guys hiring?

02:47.515 --> 02:49.212
Oh, yeah.
Position's been filled.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.475
Whatever, yo.
-Hun, it ain't like that.

02:51.519 --> 02:52.563
Like what?

02:54.913 --> 02:57.002
All right. Hey, hey.
I'm gonna need you to reach in

02:57.046 --> 02:59.048
that register right now,
and grab me that money.

02:59.091 --> 03:02.312
-You little shit.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.366
I didn't go through
37 hours of labor,

03:12.409 --> 03:15.107
just to have some crackhead
threaten my livelihood

03:15.151 --> 03:16.065
and my baby.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.246
Make America great again!

03:23.290 --> 03:25.596
Yeah!

03:37.304 --> 03:39.871
Oh, Come on. Hey,
come on, man! Ah, sh--

03:43.135 --> 03:45.137
Oh, my God! I knew you
was gonna come here, man.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.662
How you doing, man?
So, you brought
the homies with you, man?

03:47.705 --> 03:51.535
I got my homies, but do you
have my money? My $10,000?

03:51.579 --> 03:54.930
-You know I'm good for it, man.
You know I--
-I gave you plenty time.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.324
I borrowed you
when you came out of prison,

03:57.367 --> 04:00.414
and your mother was sick,
and needed medicine.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.893
And I'm your friend.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.288
Look, I'm a convicted felon.
They're not hiring
convicted felons out here.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.072
-Get my money back from him.
-Oh, come on, man.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.379
-We're supposed to be cool.
-You think I'm a bank?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.076
I got an idea. I got an idea.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.948
I just started
my GoFundMe account.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.255
All right? All these white folks
gonna put mad money in there,

04:15.298 --> 04:17.082
to ship my Black ass
back to Africa, man.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.388
And all of it can go to you.

04:19.389 --> 04:22.218
-Right? See!
-I will donate.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.047
This is the stupidest
idea I ever heard.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.136
The stupidest idea
he's ever heard.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.703
Just give me two weeks
and I'll get your money.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.444
-I promise you. Just two weeks.
-

04:32.924 --> 04:34.578
Two days, man. Just two days.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.014
-I'll give it in two days.
-

04:37.494 --> 04:39.279
Hold up. One second, one second.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.019
Okay, sir. One second up.

04:41.063 --> 04:43.457
Well, I ain't mean one second.
I mean, give me a second.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.719
I'll give you two days.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.896
Two days, you bring me my money.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.332
Or we have a big problem.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.205
Big problem.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.775
You came by yourself,
I would have whipped your butt.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.211
You say something?

04:59.255 --> 05:01.605
No, man.
I ain't say nothing, man.

05:01.649 --> 05:02.519
Okay.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.264
Fake-ass motherfucker,
I can't stand these things.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.744
You say something?

05:09.787 --> 05:11.876
Nothing, man.
I ain't say nothing!

05:11.920 --> 05:16.098
I think you insult me,
with your mind.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.752
I said you was a nice guy.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.275
Vladimir! Sergei!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.885
Why you gotta
call them back, man?

05:23.975 --> 05:25.803
Tell me the truth.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.502
I said you need...

05:28.545 --> 05:30.373
Need to wipe that...

05:32.506 --> 05:34.682
...corny-ass smile off your face
every time you talk.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.511
What smile?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.905
-That one right there!
-You-- that is not a smile.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.081
You hurt my feelings.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.822
You think I like to
live with this smile?

05:44.866 --> 05:46.302
It is affliction.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.130
My mother born me with this.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.526
Get out.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.661
Send my love to your Grams.

06:01.404 --> 06:05.539
Look, what you need to do
is get your behind up,
and go get you a job.

06:05.582 --> 06:08.193
I'm about tired of this.
I know what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna cut your food off,

06:08.237 --> 06:10.326
'cause you stuck on stupid.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.808
And while you're back there,
roll me one of them blunts.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.462
Gonna give me a heart attack.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.072
You know I got the sugar.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.291
I need something
to calm my nerves down.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.643
-Yo, Patel.
Where you going, bro?

06:22.686 --> 06:25.341
Oh, I'm going back home, man.
Trump is now president,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.604
and they're accusing people
for voting illegally.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.041
I don't want to get
deported to Pakistan.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.392
-But you're Indian!
-They don't know the difference!

06:32.435 --> 06:35.438
If I get deported to Pakistan,
I'll be beheaded.

06:35.482 --> 06:39.486
-I'm not Muslim. I'm Hindu!
-Bro, the wall is not
for Indians!

06:39.529 --> 06:42.750
-I have to rush.
I have to go, bro.
-Yo, at least let me get you

06:42.793 --> 06:44.926
-a suitcase, you can't go
to India with a Glad bag!
-Oh, man.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.797
Thanks for that,
but I don't need you, bro.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.669
-Take care, bye!
-But what about our
Jim Magello party?

06:48.712 --> 06:51.498
-Oh, see you! Good luck, bro!
-Bro, our Jim Magello party!

06:51.541 --> 06:55.153
Come on, man.
I'll be beheaded! Bye!

06:55.197 --> 06:57.634
Yo, can you believe that Patel's
going back to India, man?

06:57.678 --> 07:00.420
-That's crazy, man. All my
Mexican friends are leaving.
-Ain't it?

07:00.463 --> 07:03.292
-But he's Indian.
-Ah, man. You know I can't tell
the difference...

07:03.335 --> 07:06.208
-You cannot be that ignorant.
-Hey, let's roll out, man.
You know what I'm saying?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.558
-Get some hoops!
-My grandma putting
all this pressure on me

07:08.602 --> 07:11.213
to get this job,
but I think I got it, bro.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.389
Right here,
we're gonna be Africans.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.087
-We're going to be Africans?
-Man, I promise you.
Go find Peewee.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.915
I shall find Peewee.
I'll be back.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.700
-All right, bro.
-Good job.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.092
Africa needs you!

07:22.050 --> 07:23.486
Africa! Africa!

07:25.836 --> 07:29.405
Africa! Africa!
It's a magical place.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.276
South Africa needs you.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.931
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Earth...

07:33.975 --> 07:35.977
look at my brothers.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.806
Africa is in dire need
of money right now.

07:38.849 --> 07:41.983
My brother hasn't ate
in four days.

07:42.026 --> 07:45.203
He only eats on Thursdays.

07:45.247 --> 07:48.076
His inside is now outside.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.036
Oh, thank you, my sister.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.560
Thank you very much.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.826
Need your money

08:03.004 --> 08:04.701
Nigga, get out of here.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.531
Africa!

08:08.575 --> 08:10.054
Ah, can I get a hug?

08:10.098 --> 08:12.535
-Africa needs clothes.
-Ah, thank you.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.668
-Oh, oh.
-Yes, we need hug.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.974
-Man, we need some help.
-My African sister.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.324
Please help Africa, my sister.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.979
-On the behalf of Africa.
-Ah, thank you.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.286
-Africa needs you.
-Oh, what would Jesus do?

08:24.329 --> 08:26.941
-Africa!
- Africa!

08:26.984 --> 08:28.420
What are your names?

08:28.464 --> 08:31.728
Uh, my name is Mbugelolo.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.643
-Yes.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.559
My name is Gorilla Mandingo.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.867
Gorilla Mandingo, boom!

08:41.521 --> 08:44.524
I am Mbap Longschlong.

08:44.567 --> 08:48.049
-Yes, yes. Very good.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.662
You know,
you're not gonna believe this,

08:52.706 --> 08:57.624
but I used to have a lot of
strong African lovers,

08:57.667 --> 09:00.104
-back in my day.
- Oh!

09:00.148 --> 09:02.585
Oh, tell him all about that!

09:02.629 --> 09:05.414
No, he's lying. He lies.

09:05.457 --> 09:09.070
Africans are special,

09:09.113 --> 09:10.637
if you know what I mean?

09:10.680 --> 09:13.509
Especially from the motherland.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.251
I can give you more.

09:16.294 --> 09:19.776
-Wh-- what?
-Yes. What do you think?

09:19.820 --> 09:22.083
-Discu-- discuss it
with my colleague.
-Oh, thank you. Yes.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.302
-No-- what? What?
-Please.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.914
-Oh, hi. Um--
- You're my man?

09:27.871 --> 09:30.395
I really have to
get back to the ship.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.527
-To the ship?
-Yes.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.702
-We-- we must go.
-Okay.

09:39.796 --> 09:43.495
We are starving. I lost my legs,
because I have no food.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.802
I have no food.
Thank you. Thank you.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.633
Thank you. Africa needs you.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.200
Oh, love. Love. So much.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.074
Drop that back
in the bag, nigga.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.598
Put it back in the bag, nigga.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.425
Put it in the bag,
my nigga...

10:02.427 --> 10:05.039
Black people never
give back to the Black people.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.215
This is the problem
with the America.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.912
Africa loves you.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.827
-Please, give to Africa.
-You, I know you.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.047
-No, don't. No, I am African.
-You're not African.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.615
-You are not
African...
-You are rubbish! I tell you--

10:15.658 --> 10:17.704
Hey, hey! Hey, nigga! What the--

10:17.747 --> 10:18.879
Hey, nigga!

10:19.967 --> 10:21.621
Hey! Hey!

10:26.800 --> 10:29.498
What is
Mount St. Helens?
-

10:30.804 --> 10:32.762
I said,
"What is Mount St. Helens?"

10:35.069 --> 10:37.114
-Grandma, we're done here.
You sipping on that lean again?
-What is--

10:37.158 --> 10:38.986
Don't worry about
what I'm sipping on, boy.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.425
What is Mount Olympus?

10:44.948 --> 10:47.124
Now he's slamming stuff.
He better count up.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.738
-What is Mount Vesuvius?
-Give me that.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.740
-Oh, snap!
Give me my stuff back!
-Here, take this.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.699
I don't want this. What the hell
is this green stuff?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.222
That's Gorilla Life, okay?

10:58.266 --> 11:00.050
-Gorilla Life?
-Yes.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.704
-It's a real
healthy drink for you.
-Chlorophyll?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.663
No. Hell, no. Chlorophyll drink.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.665
Round about your age,
you need to be drinking
real healthy, okay?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.449
-Now, drink that for me.
-Don't worry about my damn age.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.930
Last time I looked,
I was a grown-ass woman,

11:09.973 --> 11:12.933
and I don't want to drink
no chlorophyll drink.
Is this gonna

11:12.976 --> 11:15.544
-make my shit green?
-No, Ma. It's not gonna
make your stuff green.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.068
-How do you know?
-Matter of fact, check your
blood sugar while you're at it.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.680
I'm not checking my blood sugar.
I'm tired of this.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.551
-Child, I'm tired-- I--
-Grandma, you gotta
do it everyday.

11:22.594 --> 11:23.987
Let me tell you
what I got to do.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.250
I got to stay Black,
die and pay taxes,

11:26.294 --> 11:29.123
and I'm gonna
figure out how not to
die and pay taxes, Goddammit!

11:29.166 --> 11:32.387
And if I wanted to be pricked,
I'd go get me some damn Viagra,

11:32.430 --> 11:35.390
and walk my slaphappy ass down
to the senior citizens center.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.306
Let them prick me.
How about that, buddy?

11:38.349 --> 11:39.742
Can you please
check this blood sugar?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.570
You check and I'll
give you your lean back.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.051
You know what, you about
getting on my damn nerves.

11:44.094 --> 11:47.489
I'll check my blood sugar.
I will check my blood sugar.

11:50.927 --> 11:54.365
-You happy now? 158. 158.
-I'm happy.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.759
-Now, can I have my lean back?
-No, drink that healthy juice.

11:56.803 --> 12:00.894
-Right there.
-Goddamnit, I want to slap this
upside your Black-ass head.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.460
Gorilla Life...

12:03.984 --> 12:05.899
I'm telling you,
yesterday, when I came here,

12:05.942 --> 12:08.205
this park looked like-- look...

12:08.249 --> 12:10.077
Hey, there's a white man,
right there.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.774
Hey, wait, that's the owner
of that series. That's a whi--

12:11.818 --> 12:14.385
-that's a rich white man,
right there.
-Okay...

12:14.429 --> 12:16.605
That's not bad. That's not bad.
We got one over here.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.695
This park is empty!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.349
Listen to me.
I swear to you. Yesterday,

12:21.392 --> 12:23.394
when I came here,
it looked like Orange County.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.093
It was like, white people,
far as you can see.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.790
-It looked like a Trump rally.
-

12:27.834 --> 12:30.184
-See, where they at now?
-I don't know...

12:30.227 --> 12:32.229
-Maybe they ain't up yet.
-What do you mean?

12:32.273 --> 12:34.579
White folks are
the first to get up, man.
They jogging at six A.M.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.408
Why you wasting my time, man?
I could be at home whacking off.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.541
And you know he takes
his whacking off seriously, man.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.412
If he don't drain that lizard,
you know how he be acting.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.458
Why y'all yelling at me?
I found the last park,

12:43.501 --> 12:45.590
the lady gave us some money.
True, y'all ain't found nothing.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.636
Y'all keep yelling,
but you find your own damn park.

12:48.811 --> 12:52.293
-Sensitive.
-And then y'all always hoping
that he yelling at me,

12:52.336 --> 12:54.817
like it's my fault and
I ain't seen y'all do nothing.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.874
Your Highness, we are
so pleased to have found you.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.188
Your Majesty,
I am Dr. Zulu Zokoye,

13:18.232 --> 13:20.103
diviner and Priestess.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.279
Pardon our intrusion,
Your Majesty.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.195
But the King has died and...

13:25.239 --> 13:27.415
the Oracle
demands your presence.

13:28.416 --> 13:32.072
-They've got stories with it.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.248
These boys
are good, man.
- Wait, wait, look.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.727
We got to step our game up, man.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.425
He got them gladiator boots on.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.645
He got that Air Jerusalem.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.259
Oh, listen, man. Obviously,
y'all take this look

13:45.302 --> 13:47.435
way too serious than we are,
but y'all can have this park.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.697
-Ain't no white people
here anyway.
-Yeah.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.179
Them shoes are
killing me, though.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.745
The state ain't
coming down, nigga.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.704
-Leave it a second.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.158
Turn crappy music off.

14:18.161 --> 14:22.296
Hey, Sebastian.
You don't run away from me.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.257
I tell you not to mess with me,
but you don't listen, huh?

14:28.302 --> 14:30.130
Vladimir, you know what to do.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.045
-Oh, hey! Oh, oh.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.873
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

14:34.961 --> 14:35.918
Who?

14:40.836 --> 14:43.273
Man, that's those nutcases
that keep saying I'm their King.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.930
I know this woman.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.845
I see her on television.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.196
She said she come to America,
to bring King back to Africa.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.894
Take that gun away from my King.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.420
If you don't,
I will have no other choice,

14:59.463 --> 15:02.814
but to use divine African force.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.251
What are you waiting for?

15:04.294 --> 15:06.383
-Not a good idea.
-Shoot them.

15:10.735 --> 15:11.954
What?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.782
I warned you.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.305
What is happening?

15:16.872 --> 15:17.917
I warned you.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.270
This is ultimate cock-block.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.011
Mm-hmm.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.317
This is not a time or place
for something like this.

15:27.361 --> 15:30.799
You may not accept
the decision of the Oracle,

15:30.842 --> 15:33.497
but it is my place
to enforce it.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.372
What's this?

15:46.815 --> 15:49.122
I see you have messed
with the spiritual head

15:49.165 --> 15:51.254
of the United States of Africa.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.561
And now you're happy about it?

15:53.604 --> 15:56.042
It's birth defect.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.173
Yeah, I heard that before.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.435
It's not funny!

16:04.050 --> 16:05.486
-What?
-He said,

16:05.529 --> 16:08.750
"He will fucking kill you,

16:08.793 --> 16:11.057
bitch motherfucker."

16:11.100 --> 16:12.928
Whoa! You just spoke Russian?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.017
Man, you've got to be CIA,
'cause I don't know

16:15.061 --> 16:17.715
no Black person in the world
that speak Russian.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.805
The Oracle is divine
and can speak any language,

16:20.849 --> 16:22.068
through the Priestess.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.248
Would you like them
to shoot their... Hmm.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.337
Ah, let me think
about it for a second.

16:30.380 --> 16:33.166
The power of the Oracle
must not be toyed with.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.516
-Ha!
-

16:35.559 --> 16:37.387
What do you desire, my King?

16:37.431 --> 16:38.998
You know what?

16:39.041 --> 16:40.782
Let them go.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.791
Come. I'll do you a favor.

16:59.409 --> 17:02.412
Why you
do this to me?

17:02.456 --> 17:03.370
You're welcome.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.722
Why she hit me?

17:10.594 --> 17:13.336
Your face. It is okay.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.383
There's no stupid smile?

17:17.514 --> 17:18.689
No more Tourettes?

17:21.040 --> 17:21.997
You cured me?

17:24.782 --> 17:26.001
No it ain't, it just came back!

17:26.045 --> 17:26.958
No...

17:27.959 --> 17:29.918
this is happy, joy face.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.311
Stop smiling.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.010
Now, smile again.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.055
I'm cured.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.107
I owe you, like the Starks.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.154
Like the Lannisters, you mean?

17:52.158 --> 17:53.898
Wait. Come back.

18:03.691 --> 18:04.648
No.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.173
Just go.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.180
That was amazing! Had them
Russians running out here,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.616
like they didn't
know what happened to him.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.705
Man, you talking
about some Lannisters.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.011
Game of Thrones.I didn't know
y'all watched that in Africa.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.622
I thought y'all
lived in trees and shit.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.232
Oh, yes.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.016
Even the American
ambassador lives on

18:25.060 --> 18:26.931
one of the tallest trees.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.151
Right next to
the British Ambassador.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.458
Oh, even the French
and the Chinese.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.286
They live on big iroko trees.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.462
I get it. I get it. I get it.
No, for real, though, man.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.377
Like, y'all said, like, I'm some
kind of king or some shit,

18:37.420 --> 18:38.943
like, is a nigga a real king?

18:38.987 --> 18:41.555
The Oracle never lies,
Your Majesty.

18:41.598 --> 18:44.601
And that... Man, you just paid
that debt like it was nothing.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.777
Gave that dude $10,000!

18:46.821 --> 18:48.214
Man, $5,000, I'd have
been straight...

18:48.257 --> 18:49.432
You know what
I'm saying? Like...

18:49.476 --> 18:51.260
Whatever you wish, Your Majesty.

18:51.304 --> 18:54.263
Oh, shit. In that case,
you can give a brother $10,000.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.657
-Man, I got... Word?
-Your wish is our command.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.007
Damn!

18:59.050 --> 19:01.052
$10,000, $5,000...

19:01.096 --> 19:03.403
Oh, smack!
You mind if I hold on to that?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.274
Your wish...
-Wow.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.797
...is our command.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.582
Yeah, woo-hoo.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.497
Hold up.
This ain't no set up, is it?

19:12.629 --> 19:15.154
Come on, brothers just don't be
handing people a whole bunch
of money like that.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.198
Where the cameras at?

19:17.547 --> 19:19.375
I know there's some
cameras in here somewhere.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.682
Come on, man.
I know I'm being Punk'd.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.163
Look, if I'm being Punk'd,
just come on out right now.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.076
Come on, man.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.428
Hey, this is all right.
So, look,

19:28.471 --> 19:30.212
I'm just gonna
pay a couple bills,

19:30.256 --> 19:31.648
as y'all can see on the cameras,

19:31.692 --> 19:33.737
they just handed me
this voluntarily.

19:33.781 --> 19:37.001
It's all good. I'm the King,
I think. Right?

19:38.264 --> 19:41.180
All right, well just--
you know what? I'm just going
to count this out in the crib.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.008
Just wait for me, real quick.
I'll be right back.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.054
And then I'll be right back.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.752
Don't go nowhere.
Just wait right there.
I ain't going nowhere.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.016
Just gonna get some gas.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.151
All right?
Make sure the Russians are gone.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.683
Oh, hey, guys!

20:06.727 --> 20:08.424
Drinks on me tonight, baby!

20:16.389 --> 20:18.347
Oh, boy. Miss Wright, this is...

20:19.740 --> 20:21.481
This is fascinating.
You realize that

20:21.524 --> 20:24.353
this has not been seen
since the 1870s?

20:24.397 --> 20:29.140
The Priestess makes her first
appearance in Egypt, 300 BC.

20:29.184 --> 20:33.667
She saves the pharaoh
and most of the ruling dynasty

20:33.710 --> 20:35.495
by getting them
out of the country,

20:35.538 --> 20:38.411
before Alexander the Great
can invade it with his armies.

20:39.586 --> 20:42.632
She guides them through the
Sahara Desert into West Africa.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.331
She helps them
rebuild the kingdom,

20:45.374 --> 20:47.550
on the banks
of the Niger Rivers.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.858
They enjoy 1000 years
of peace and prosperity.

20:51.815 --> 20:54.078
Though, that's interrupted
by the Portuguese

20:54.122 --> 20:56.864
and the Spaniards,
when they invade West Africa.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.999
And once again she appears
to save the royal dynasty.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.915
She-- she leads them
from the Niger River,

21:04.959 --> 21:09.529
across the Atlantic Ocean
over to Virginia in 1619.

21:09.572 --> 21:13.446
They were the first to establish
12 colonies in the Americas.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.883
Before the pilgrims arrived.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.668
1619. You know what
that does to our history?

21:20.148 --> 21:23.325
But soon after they do arrive,
the pilgrims and explorers,

21:23.369 --> 21:25.762
and in this case, she is
responsible for saving them

21:25.806 --> 21:29.462
from starvation and death,
because of the harsh winter.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.203
That same harsh winter,
in 1620 in Europe,

21:32.247 --> 21:34.684
killed tens of thousands
of people.

21:34.728 --> 21:38.253
She establishes a 13th colony
for the pilgrims, she...

21:39.210 --> 21:41.517
Look at this. She--
she drafts a constitution,

21:41.561 --> 21:46.087
giving equal rights to all
citizens of all 13 colonies.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.002
Look at this...

21:48.045 --> 21:52.093
Manhattan Island becomes the
capital of the United Colonies.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.443
1776...

21:54.487 --> 21:56.576
She reveals
a secret plot to betray her,

21:56.619 --> 21:59.361
and kill the leaders
of the 12 African colonies.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.059
She's forbidden, however,
to do evil or see evil.

22:02.103 --> 22:06.107
She invites all the leaders
of all 13 colonies to a dinner.

22:06.150 --> 22:09.328
She recognizes that there's
someone in the dinner with her,

22:09.371 --> 22:12.374
that was going to betray her
and the 12 colonies.

22:12.418 --> 22:16.422
She'll depart after the night.
She'll return after 400 years,

22:16.465 --> 22:19.207
and she'll take a king
from amongst their descendants

22:19.250 --> 22:21.949
back to Africa
to rebuild the kingdom.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.820
So, this is the year
that it's going to happen.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.084
This is-- this is just amazing.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.915
...yeah, you know what
I'm saying...

22:36.006 --> 22:38.487
Everybody, she wants to know
what I do for a living.

22:38.531 --> 22:39.401
I'm King.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.750
Yeah, baby!

22:40.794 --> 22:42.361
I love kings.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.623
Me too!

22:43.666 --> 22:44.537
Sorry, sweetie.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.716
See, where I'm from, we kings,

22:49.759 --> 22:51.935
we rule with an iron fist.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.593
-That's probably the 'shrooms!
-

22:57.637 --> 22:59.769
Okay.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.381
Ah, okay, um...

23:07.211 --> 23:08.691
Boom! We got some situations.

23:12.826 --> 23:13.870
Your Majesty.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.091
Y'all don't let up, do y'all?

23:17.134 --> 23:20.268
A King stands while you sit?

23:21.269 --> 23:23.837
On your feet,
you half-race commoners,

23:23.880 --> 23:25.534
-in the presence of the King!
-

23:25.578 --> 23:26.579
On your feet!

23:28.319 --> 23:30.670
-Told y'all I was King.
-

23:30.713 --> 23:31.758
They work for me.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.456
These boys have got it!

23:34.500 --> 23:36.240
I told you they was
going to find us, though.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.155
-See, I told him
y'all was gonna find us.
-He's right.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.244
All this was set up for
y'all to find us...

23:40.288 --> 23:42.682
'Cause I knew that
y'all was the real deal.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.945
See what I'm talking-- but
how the hell did you find us?

23:44.988 --> 23:47.251
The Oracle leads. We follow.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.776
-Damn, I got to get that app!
-We gotta get that app!

23:49.819 --> 23:51.821
Keep your mouth closed, man.
This is classified.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.997
All right? Top secret stuff.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.216
All right, ladies...

23:56.739 --> 23:58.132
on behalf of Homeland Security,
y'all need to get out.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.873
This is some real king stuff
we got to talk about,

23:59.916 --> 24:01.570
-and y'all can't be here.
-Will you call me later?

24:01.614 --> 24:03.485
Yeah, keep
your damn mouth closed.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.487
All right? This is
king shit. King talk.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.968
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, turn the lights down.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.448
Sshhh!

24:11.928 --> 24:15.454
Now... For real,
how did y'all find me?

24:15.497 --> 24:18.326
The Oracle shows us
your location, Your Highness.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.241
Every time?
-Every time.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.025
-You mean, even when I'm--
-Yes.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.506
-Oh, damn.
-

24:24.550 --> 24:27.944
-A-- about that,
Your Majesty... Not to worry.
-But you know I got my Gra--

24:27.988 --> 24:29.772
We have
already taken care of that.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.166
She's in the most
prestigious adult living,

24:32.209 --> 24:33.907
with 24-hour nurse care.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.779
She sends her regards,
with many bad words.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.302
Yeah, that's Grams.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.000
All right, but what about
my homies, though?

24:40.043 --> 24:41.697
So, you know I can't go
nowhere without my homies.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.699
-We come as a package.
-Yeah. Ride or die.

24:43.743 --> 24:44.831
You might as well kill us.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.531
-This is how you do it, baby!
-Hey, man!

24:49.575 --> 24:52.012
Look, they even
got you in a magazine, bro!

24:52.055 --> 24:55.842
-Man, you look good, yo!
Look at that!
-I feel like Leroy Trunks.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.673
Here you go, baby.
Let me have another one.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.762
Yeah, I'll give you a tip when
we get back there, all right?

25:03.893 --> 25:06.113
Tell her I ain't got
no damn money, boy.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.376
Buffalo soldier

25:17.472 --> 25:20.519
Taken to America
-Hey, do me a favor.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.260
Hey, man, don't try to sing,
'cause, you know, you're not
really a singer.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.611
-So, let us do that.
-Yeah, man. You need to
get some singing lessons, bro.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.308
-You know what, man?

25:27.351 --> 25:29.615
-What?
-Fuck...

25:33.140 --> 25:35.403
Yo, yo, yo, yo
-Again!

25:39.146 --> 25:42.192
Yo, yo, yo, yo...
-

26:05.215 --> 26:06.956
Damn, look at all those people!

26:08.436 --> 26:10.743
Man, they got
on masks and stuff.
I'm not going out there, man.

26:10.786 --> 26:14.834
Yeah, last time I've seen that
many brothers with masks on,
I got robbed.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.967
Somebody needs to go out there
and make sure you cool.
Come on, you need to go do it.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.187
-Yeah, you ain't afraid
of nothing. You should do it.
-Nigga, I ain't going!

26:20.230 --> 26:22.798
What do you mean you ain't
going? We come all the way
to sit on the plane?

26:22.842 --> 26:25.453
Get your ass out there
and talk to the people,
make sure the King's okay.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.498
-You're the strongest one.
-Man, Charles, you a G, man.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.545
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. You the man.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.242
-I'm the man.
-That's what I'm saying.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.157
I'm gonna do this, nigga.
I'm gonna do this, nigga!

26:34.201 --> 26:36.551
Woo! Yeah, nigga. I'm gonna
do it for my King, nigga!

26:36.595 --> 26:38.901
-Gonna do it for
the King, nigga!
-Do it! Do it!

26:39.902 --> 26:43.297
-They about to eat his ass.
-They're gonna eat his ass,
for sure...

27:15.024 --> 27:17.331
-Oh, da-- he dancing.
-Oh, smack.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.507
That's probably
what they make you do.
They probably make you dance,

27:19.550 --> 27:22.162
-right before they
boil your ass.
-I-- I think he's hot.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.732
-He's boogying, look!
-Look, they dancing
with him, though.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.690
Okay, I think we're good!

27:28.734 --> 27:30.910
-Give him five more minutes.
-They really dancing with him!

27:30.953 --> 27:33.347
No, it looks
like they're sneaking
and surrounding him to me.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.919
See what I'm saying?
Look at this, man.
I want to go out there!

27:39.962 --> 27:41.747
-He having fun, man.
What are you doing in here?
-I know!

27:41.790 --> 27:43.400
-Okay. All right.
-Come on, man. Let's go!

27:43.444 --> 27:44.967
They'd have
eaten him by now, let's go.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.755
Woo! You see these places?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.288
Welcome, Your Majesty.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.682
Let this flower
give warmth and joy

28:47.726 --> 28:50.206
to the people of
the United States of Africa.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.732
You understand, baby?
We got it going, boy!
Dude, we popping!

28:53.775 --> 28:57.474
Out here,
we have a lion petting zoo
I would like you two to see.

28:57.518 --> 29:00.260
Hold on, you telling me y'all
got real lions here right now?

29:00.303 --> 29:02.392
-Y'all got giraffes too?
- We have some giraffes.

29:02.436 --> 29:05.004
I'll see y'all later, y'all
go ahead, talk to each other.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.657
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit!

29:09.356 --> 29:11.358
Nigga, they got a lagoon!

29:11.401 --> 29:13.229
-Oh, shit!
-Look, look, look, look, look.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.755
Woo!

29:22.369 --> 29:24.893
And these are the princesses

29:24.937 --> 29:27.591
of the royal families of Africa,
Your Majesty.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.811
There are eight of them,
that you can keep

29:29.855 --> 29:31.682
to maintain your chambers,
and one of them

29:31.726 --> 29:33.249
that you can make your Queen.

29:33.293 --> 29:36.513
Damn. So, who are those,
uh, my real mothers?

29:36.557 --> 29:40.300
Oh, no. These are
the wives of the former King,

29:40.343 --> 29:41.867
that you now inherit.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.962
Come with me,
let me talk to you.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.053
Nigga, are you crazy?

29:54.096 --> 29:56.838
Man, I can't be with no old-ass,
shriveled up woman!

29:56.882 --> 30:00.102
No, Your Majesty.
You are to inherit them all,

30:00.146 --> 30:02.888
and also be a husband,
if you get my drift.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.977
Man, that shit ain't drifting.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.282
Who is that?

30:08.110 --> 30:11.548
-Uh, no, Your Maj--
no, Your Majesty. Your M--
-Give me a second.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.986
She is-- she is not
of royal blood, Your Majesty.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.597
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-I'm sorry,
Your Majesty. I'm late.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.686
Is that an American accent
that I'm hearing?

30:18.729 --> 30:20.862
-Yes.
-Man, what are you doing
out here in this jungle?

30:20.906 --> 30:25.301
-You call this "the jungle?"
-Not like that. I'm just saying,

30:25.345 --> 30:28.565
-you don't find women
this beautiful in Africa.
-Have you ever been to Africa?

30:28.609 --> 30:30.524
Well, you know, it don't get
no Blacker than me, baby.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.353
That's sweet-- that berry gets
real sweet around this thing.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.137
Oh, man.
I'll get it back later.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.835
Oh, by the way,
what's your name?

30:36.878 --> 30:39.402
-Keke, Your Majesty.
-O-Keke...

30:39.446 --> 30:40.969
I like the sound of that.

30:41.013 --> 30:44.059
Me and you gonna be O-Keke!

30:45.539 --> 30:46.845
Where did they find him?

30:49.543 --> 30:51.980
What-- what are you
doing with him?

30:52.024 --> 30:52.894
Seriously?

30:55.201 --> 30:57.159
What does he want?

30:57.203 --> 30:59.205
The Oracle has spoken.
We have a King.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.946
A King we know nothing about.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.904
Besides, he does not
have the royal pendant.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.471
I have mine.

31:04.514 --> 31:09.128
No African king has ever
been crowned without one.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.825
I move that we
wait a couple of weeks,

31:10.869 --> 31:13.262
to be really sure
of what the Oracle is saying.

31:17.788 --> 31:21.923
The Council of Chiefs
has decided to move your
coronation up by two weeks.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.012
Man, I knew
this was a scam, man.

31:24.056 --> 31:27.146
-Look, fellas--
-Your Majesty, can I make you,

31:27.189 --> 31:30.410
-like you Americans say, a deal?
- Ha ha! Yes, a deal.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.151
Now I'm bet that.

31:32.194 --> 31:35.937
Suppose we request the Oracle...

31:35.981 --> 31:38.766
to convince and prove
to you within two weeks.

31:38.809 --> 31:42.552
If in two weeks,
you are not entirely satisfied,

31:42.596 --> 31:46.382
then we will pay you handsomely
and take you back to America.

31:49.603 --> 31:52.301
We need this contract
signed ASAP, mate.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.434
-You have my word.
- As what?

31:54.477 --> 31:57.176
-You told us you were
next in line for the throne.
-I am.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.265
-It was his clan.
-Yes. Where did he come from?

31:59.308 --> 32:01.615
He was approached
by Dr. Zulu Zokoye,

32:01.658 --> 32:03.747
a neurosurgeon who
abandoned her practice,

32:03.791 --> 32:06.881
after being
summoned by the Oracle
to become a high Priestess.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.275
She told him that he was
chosen to be the new King.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.973
So, it's a conwoman
and some idiot from Compton.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.628
No American is
going to take my place.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.456
Goody! What exactly
does that mean?

32:16.499 --> 32:18.545
Just give me some days, I'll
make sure they see a reason,

32:18.588 --> 32:20.721
why we can't have
that homie as our King.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.201
We've given you
a bucket-load of money.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.159
Yeah, and you'd be
in a terrible bind...

32:24.203 --> 32:27.336
-Terrible bind.
-...if we were to suddenly
ask for it back.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.774
I need this
more than you, Mr. Wanker.

32:30.818 --> 32:33.255
Relax. I won't let you down.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.344
I'll take care of all of you.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.219
It's "Wan-kay."

32:41.655 --> 32:43.396
"Wan-kay."

32:43.439 --> 32:46.747
Like, "Allez,"
"Manger," "Porte."

32:46.790 --> 32:48.575
You foo-kay!

32:48.618 --> 32:52.057
Everything we think
we know about history,

32:52.100 --> 32:55.277
has been an elaborate cover up.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.541
These documents go all the way
back to ancient Egypt.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.239
300 BC...

33:00.282 --> 33:03.720
when this Priestess
mysteriously appeared.

33:04.721 --> 33:09.335
She saved the royal dynasty from
Alexander the Great's invasion.

33:09.378 --> 33:13.426
She took them through the
Libyan desert to West Africa,

33:13.469 --> 33:16.037
or what we know as Timbuktu.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.952
And she helps the royal dynasty

33:17.996 --> 33:21.042
rebuild their kingdom,
on the Niger River.

33:21.086 --> 33:24.959
And for about 1000 years,
there's peace and prosperity.

33:25.003 --> 33:29.050
Until the Portuguese
and the Spaniards invade.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.487
Again, she mysteriously appears,

33:31.531 --> 33:34.534
and she takes them
through the Niger River,

33:34.577 --> 33:37.319
across the Atlantic Ocean,
to Virginia.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.061
Well before we thought
Africans first arrived.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.933
So, this is 1619.

33:44.196 --> 33:48.896
The Priestess helps the royal
dynasty establish 12 colonies.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.724
First, in Virginia.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.857
And again,
there's peace and prosperity,

33:53.901 --> 33:56.686
until the Europeans arrived.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.907
And with the arrival
of the Europeans,

33:59.950 --> 34:02.736
the Priestess helps them
establish a 13th colony,

34:02.779 --> 34:05.347
specifically for the Pilgrims.

34:05.391 --> 34:09.960
And she helps them
get through that winter of 1620.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.833
She also helps them
draft the Constitution,

34:12.876 --> 34:16.793
granting equal rights to all
the citizens of these colonies.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.100
They established
Manhattan Island as the capital

34:19.144 --> 34:20.928
of these united colonies.

34:20.971 --> 34:25.889
And again, there's peace
and prosperity until 1776.

34:25.933 --> 34:31.460
The Founding Fathers plot to
kill and betray the Priestess.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.898
And she learns about this plot,
so she hosts this dinner,

34:34.942 --> 34:37.945
with the 12 leaders
of the African colonies,

34:37.988 --> 34:39.903
and the 13th colony
of Europeans.

34:41.035 --> 34:44.778
And it's there,
at this feast that she...

34:45.779 --> 34:47.781
lets them know,
that she knows that

34:47.824 --> 34:50.131
someone here will betray her...

34:50.175 --> 34:53.003
like Judas and Jesus.

34:53.047 --> 34:57.965
And she explains that, because
she can't see or hear evil...

34:58.008 --> 35:00.098
that she will be leaving.

35:00.141 --> 35:05.103
But she also prophesied that
she'll return after 400 years,

35:05.146 --> 35:07.279
to take back an African King,

35:07.322 --> 35:10.064
back to the homeland,
to rebuild the kingdom.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.589
The next night,
the American revolutionaries

35:13.633 --> 35:17.724
start a great fire, and they
kill the African leaders,

35:17.767 --> 35:19.639
and they take over
the 13 colonies.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.771
They enslave the Africans,

35:21.815 --> 35:24.818
and they strip them
of all of their rights.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.646
And fortunately,

35:26.689 --> 35:29.692
it's then that
a new government is organized.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.130
They call themselves
the Society of Friends,

35:32.173 --> 35:36.308
and they continue to spread
the prophecy of the Priestess.

35:36.351 --> 35:39.615
They oppose the slavery
of these Africans,

35:39.659 --> 35:44.577
that's building in the newly
established American colonies.

35:44.620 --> 35:48.363
They commission a marble
sculpture of the Priestess,

35:48.407 --> 35:52.062
and they write
the prophecy on it.

35:52.106 --> 35:56.023
Now, flash forward to
the American Civil War, 1861.

35:56.066 --> 35:58.895
They give this statue
to President Lincoln.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.897
And it's because of this statue,

36:00.941 --> 36:03.813
that he signs
the Emancipation Proclamation.

36:03.857 --> 36:07.208
Abolishing slavery, essentially
ending the Civil War.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.733
But of course, as we know,
Lincoln is assassinated...

36:11.647 --> 36:14.563
and the new president,
Andrew Johnson,

36:14.607 --> 36:18.263
signs an executive order,
to keep all information

36:18.306 --> 36:21.657
on the Priestess
as classified and secret.

36:21.701 --> 36:24.747
He hides the statue
in the Metropolitan Museum.

36:24.791 --> 36:29.056
But, a small faction
of the Republicans
that control Congress,

36:29.099 --> 36:32.190
also happen to be
made up of members of
the Society of Friends.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.322
They impeach Andrew Johnson.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.367
And...

36:36.411 --> 36:38.239
flash forward
all the way to 2020.

36:38.283 --> 36:41.416
The Priestess has returned
to fulfill her prophecy,

36:41.460 --> 36:42.939
400 years later.

36:42.983 --> 36:46.595
And she's come to
take back an African King,

36:46.639 --> 36:48.771
to rebuild the kingdom.

36:50.773 --> 36:53.211
All hail, our good King!

36:58.520 --> 37:00.740
Well, what have I done
to deserve this?

37:01.697 --> 37:03.351
Oh, this is a beautiful life.

37:10.315 --> 37:13.318
Well, if it ain't my sexy,
little librarian.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.928
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.

37:15.842 --> 37:16.886
Have a seat, baby.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.846
What's up, shawty?

37:21.021 --> 37:23.632
We're used to being called
by our names, Your Majesty.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.634
Marcus Garvey once said,

37:25.678 --> 37:28.246
"If you have
no confidence in self,

37:28.289 --> 37:30.639
then you're twice defeated
in the race of life."

37:30.683 --> 37:32.293
You trying to
kick knowledge to a nigga?

37:34.295 --> 37:37.603
"And it's a slave's mentality
and we must emancipate
ourselves from it."

37:37.646 --> 37:40.170
-Bob Marley.
-Why do you hate me so much?

37:40.214 --> 37:44.523
-I don't hate you.
I hate the system.
-What system?

37:44.566 --> 37:47.743
The system that
forces you on us as our King.

37:47.787 --> 37:51.573
The system that decides
who is pure and who isn't.

37:51.617 --> 37:53.445
If it was up to you,
would I be here?

37:55.011 --> 37:56.709
I must leave now, Your Majesty.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.189
Have dinner with me.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.974
No, she cannot.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.976
Please, let's talk outside.
Man-to-man.

38:03.933 --> 38:06.632
She is not royalty.

38:06.675 --> 38:09.330
Royalty?

38:09.374 --> 38:11.550
All of a sudden it matters?

38:11.593 --> 38:12.986
I'm royalty now?

38:14.944 --> 38:18.426
You used to be power, bro.
I'm power now.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.995
You've been here all this time,

38:22.038 --> 38:23.562
dreaming, wishing
you could have it.

38:24.606 --> 38:25.999
Come on, man,
just let it go, Daddy.

38:27.217 --> 38:28.262
I got this.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.099
Block, block.
Block it like it's hot.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.325
What was that about?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.028
Bee-see-beep.

38:55.071 --> 38:57.900
Bee-see-beep.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.511
Bee-see...

39:00.729 --> 39:03.384
Beep!

39:03.428 --> 39:05.560
Block, block.
Block it like it's hot.

39:14.090 --> 39:17.355
A curse!

39:17.398 --> 39:21.924
A curse!

39:25.493 --> 39:28.191
going somewhere

39:28.235 --> 39:30.411
pay attention

39:30.455 --> 39:33.371
I will not take some gun-toting,

39:33.414 --> 39:36.417
drug peddling, egotistic
low life as my king.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.419
Is that so?

39:38.463 --> 39:40.726
-Oh, my God!

39:40.769 --> 39:43.772
What is this-- Oh my! Wahab!

39:43.816 --> 39:46.340
And you are their mother!
What type of ass--

39:46.384 --> 39:48.037
I mean, what type of mother

39:48.081 --> 39:50.257
lays out with
her daughters like this?

39:50.300 --> 39:53.434
-The kind that wants a tan.
- Not the point!

39:53.478 --> 39:56.872
Okay, okay. What is it
with Africans and bikinis?
I've seen National Geographic.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.961
You guys are okay with bare
titties hanging everywhere.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.528
-But a bikini--
- That is different.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.791
You are seeing Watusis

40:02.835 --> 40:05.403
and Pygmies in the middle
of the jungle.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.448
Do you go shopping
in Africa and go,

40:07.492 --> 40:10.408
"Oh, look, there are some
titties." No, you do not.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.453
Maybe you would be
in a better mood if we did.

40:12.497 --> 40:17.719
Your daughter will stand
trial for her insolence.
And that is that.

40:17.763 --> 40:20.026
-You know what? Maybe we should
give them a show, let's push!
-No!

40:20.069 --> 40:21.767
Wahab, no. No, I cannot.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.595
I cannot! I cannot!

40:23.638 --> 40:26.380
We don't have to
take this matter that far.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.730
What we want
is to keep them apart.

40:28.774 --> 40:31.777
If we make foolish resolutions,
it will become an issue.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.954
I am convinced the young lady
has gotten the message.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.564
On the contrary,
she must be punished.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.218
She's but a little girl.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.960
A little girl
with the mind of an old woman.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.918
Do not underestimate her.

40:44.311 --> 40:47.575
Welcome to the proceedings
of the Royal Court,

40:47.619 --> 40:50.012
where matters
regarding the King,

40:50.056 --> 40:53.973
his family and estate
are handled exclusively.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.760
Rise! On your feet!

40:58.804 --> 41:00.501
Yeah, rise on your feet!

41:00.545 --> 41:01.894
Oh, damn!

41:03.678 --> 41:05.550
I didn't really mean to
crash the party and all that

41:05.593 --> 41:08.030
but I ain't gonna have a seat.
Stay down.

41:08.074 --> 41:09.945
What's up, shawty?

41:09.989 --> 41:12.600
Can you give the King a little
kiss on the cheek real quick?

41:14.863 --> 41:16.386
Don't worry, we got
plenty of time for all that.

41:16.430 --> 41:21.261
Your "shawty" is on trial.

41:21.304 --> 41:24.525
She called you a gun-toting,

41:24.569 --> 41:27.572
drug-dealing
low life from America.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.011
She did nothing wrong.

41:33.186 --> 41:35.101
Everything she said is true.
Let her be.

41:37.364 --> 41:38.452
So, you're free to go.

41:40.802 --> 41:41.847
Go ahead.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.644
-What did you do, man?
- I...

41:56.688 --> 41:57.776
I stole a tuba.

41:59.647 --> 42:02.955
My ailing mother and I have had
nothing to eat for three days.

42:02.998 --> 42:05.566
This man has done nothing wrong.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.612
He's just hungry.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.178
Immoral acts.

42:10.049 --> 42:11.441
What did you do?

42:11.485 --> 42:14.140
I featured
in a music video that I...

42:15.445 --> 42:19.145
I gave a guy a hug that wasn't
even promising. And...

42:20.712 --> 42:21.930
they said I should be punished.

43:07.367 --> 43:09.456
I need you to teach me
the ways of the people.

43:09.499 --> 43:11.676
I'm just a girl, Your Majesty.
The Chiefs--

43:11.719 --> 43:14.504
Just help me to see it
the way you see it.

43:14.548 --> 43:17.029
-Your Majesty...
-You don't even have
to call me Majesty.

43:17.072 --> 43:20.641
Listen, I understand
that you may not agree
that I'm your king,

43:20.685 --> 43:22.861
-but it's fine.
-But you are a king.

43:22.904 --> 43:24.645
You've shown us all today.

43:24.689 --> 43:26.299
Listen, I'm not
who you think I am.

43:50.192 --> 43:51.890
Hey, the King is here!

43:54.675 --> 43:57.373
Hey! What's up, shawty?

43:57.417 --> 44:00.594
Is that PCB? We trying to block
all the people coming in here?

44:02.248 --> 44:05.077
Is that the High Priestess?
Priestess, what are you doing
in the club, Priestess?

44:05.120 --> 44:07.688
This is so boring in here.
What kind of party
you guys be holding out?

44:07.732 --> 44:09.734
See, this is only for royalty.

44:09.777 --> 44:11.126
And the diplomats.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.737
Listen, this is my kingdom.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.521
It cannot be boring.
You got to be popping.

44:14.564 --> 44:17.002
Yeah!

44:17.045 --> 44:18.656
Come on, man. Let's
get this party started.

44:21.310 --> 44:23.965
Hey, DJ, play a song.

44:39.154 --> 44:43.942
If the French, Spanish, British,
Italians never portioned up
into regions and countries,

44:43.985 --> 44:46.422
we would be in Africa
with no borders.

44:46.466 --> 44:49.208
"
by Rayge Smith continues]

44:52.951 --> 44:54.996
True, without
all their nihilism.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.346
They just sail right in
and put a piece--

44:57.390 --> 45:00.219
"I claim this land
in the name of the Queen."

45:00.262 --> 45:03.657
"
by Rayge Smith continues]

47:00.948 --> 47:04.082
So, as long as we can
strike deals with them

47:04.125 --> 47:07.868
that to not put us
in an unfavorable position,
then we are good.

47:07.912 --> 47:10.740
All right, give me-- give me one
second. Give me one second.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.744
-Yo, man. What's up, man?
-What's up, guys?

47:14.788 --> 47:16.485
I mean, we came over
here for a purpose.

47:16.529 --> 47:18.618
And now it seems like your
purpose ain't our purpose.

47:18.661 --> 47:20.707
Every time we see you, bro,
you're either with that girl

47:20.750 --> 47:22.535
or with these
Chiefs or whatever.

47:22.578 --> 47:24.319
Come on, man.
You got to understand me, man.

47:24.363 --> 47:26.017
I'm trying to make good
decisions for the people here.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.670
-Nigga, who are you,
Marcus-ass Garvey?
-Listen.

47:27.714 --> 47:29.237
-Come on, nigga,
this is fake. You know this.
-No.

47:29.281 --> 47:30.891
Don't say
that word no more, man.

47:30.935 --> 47:32.893
We don't use words
like "Niggas" out here, man.

47:32.937 --> 47:36.027
-Who are you, man?
-I'm the same person,
I ain't changed.

47:36.070 --> 47:37.637
Nigga, you've changed.

47:37.680 --> 47:40.292
-Come on, man.
-You ain't the same, bro.

47:45.688 --> 47:49.910
So, let me ask you.
So if we decided to partner up
with these oil companies,

47:49.954 --> 47:52.695
they're giving us
a lot of money for every man,
woman and child?

47:52.739 --> 47:56.830
Yes, Your Majesty,
but I was hoping
we could develop the land.

47:56.874 --> 48:00.921
What's more important,
skyscrapers and pavements or
food and water for the people?

48:00.965 --> 48:02.749
Food and water for the people.

48:02.792 --> 48:07.406
Did you know that $25 billion
can eradicate poverty?

48:07.449 --> 48:10.931
Let's say, we take
every drone and every bomb,

48:10.975 --> 48:14.369
and convert it into fish
and bread for the people.

48:14.413 --> 48:15.457
Where is Keke?

48:15.501 --> 48:17.590
Your Majesty, that is absurd

48:17.633 --> 48:21.246
to have a girl in meetings
about affairs of state.

48:21.289 --> 48:23.639
How do you expect our youth
to grow into developing

48:23.683 --> 48:26.207
our own country,
if we don't teach them now?

48:26.251 --> 48:29.994
It's only in Africa,
where a president can
be in office 50 years.

48:30.037 --> 48:31.734
Only in Africa.

48:32.648 --> 48:35.042
Who go at?
- Yeah, we go at!

48:55.323 --> 49:00.589
On behalf of the King,
we welcome you to our land.

49:00.633 --> 49:04.506
Ladies and gentlemen...
Mr. Wanker.

49:04.550 --> 49:06.595
Uh, thank you. It's, uh...

49:07.857 --> 49:10.425
It's "Wan-kay."
It's actually Dutch.

49:10.469 --> 49:12.036
But apart from that...

49:12.079 --> 49:16.562
myself
and Douglas completely agree

49:16.605 --> 49:20.914
that our notion here today

49:20.958 --> 49:24.744
is that everything that
we put forward and suggest

49:24.787 --> 49:26.876
is for the benefit...

49:27.965 --> 49:30.489
of the people of this great
nation and its Chiefs.

49:30.532 --> 49:32.143
Hear! Hear!.
-Thank you.

49:32.186 --> 49:34.667
Your... Majesty.

49:34.710 --> 49:37.017
If you ask me,
I'll say, do this.

49:38.279 --> 49:40.803
With my position,
I'll support however I can.

49:40.847 --> 49:43.850
I do not need anything.
It's okay, I don't want
anything from them.

49:43.893 --> 49:47.419
Why haven't you pointed
out how the people
will benefit directly?

49:48.942 --> 49:52.163
How about the land that can
no longer be farmed on,

49:52.206 --> 49:56.297
or the water is that no longer
can harbor fish due to
toxic waste from the oil?

49:56.341 --> 49:57.907
-Your Majesty!
-Mr. Wanker.

49:57.951 --> 49:59.083
It's "Wan-kay".

49:59.126 --> 50:01.389
She has a great point.

50:01.433 --> 50:04.175
Well, we would
seriously give some se--

50:04.218 --> 50:07.004
consideration to implementing
some of these changes,

50:07.047 --> 50:09.832
but I think that what we need

50:09.876 --> 50:17.014
is a primary conciliation before
we make secondary concessions.

50:17.057 --> 50:19.146
And I'd just like
to point out that

50:19.190 --> 50:22.367
you and all of your counsel
would be considered

50:22.410 --> 50:25.370
founder members,
which entitles you

50:25.413 --> 50:27.328
to a golden handshake
as it were.

50:27.372 --> 50:30.027
Sort of what
they used to call "dash."

50:30.070 --> 50:34.118
You see, how we look at it
is that if we look
after the Chiefs,

50:34.161 --> 50:36.337
there's a sort of
trickle down effect.

50:36.381 --> 50:39.210
The last night, I actually
took a look at that proposal
you gave me.

50:39.253 --> 50:41.908
You know,
I be reading sometimes,
you know what I'm saying?

50:41.951 --> 50:45.085
But that look exactly
like the same proposal

50:45.129 --> 50:47.479
that y'all just offered
my neighboring country.

50:47.522 --> 50:49.089
And you know what's so funny?

50:50.134 --> 50:53.746
I studied that same exact
contract when I was in college.

50:53.789 --> 50:54.921
It's a joint venture, right?

50:54.964 --> 50:56.140
That's right, Your Majesty.

50:56.183 --> 50:57.663
Y'all get 45%...

50:58.925 --> 51:01.101
we get 55%.

51:01.145 --> 51:04.061
Sounds really good,
but only problem with that is

51:04.104 --> 51:08.543
your 45% is on the gross,
and ours is on the net.
What's up with that?

51:08.587 --> 51:11.459
The exploration of exploitation

51:11.503 --> 51:13.940
-has to be bought. By us.
-By who?

51:13.983 --> 51:16.203
If y'all bearing all the costs,

51:16.247 --> 51:18.858
why are y'all deducting before
y'all give us our share?

51:18.901 --> 51:21.774
It's-- it's sort of
par for the course.

51:21.817 --> 51:24.342
Uh, we wouldn't
share the profits

51:24.385 --> 51:27.388
until we've paid
for costings, it's...

51:27.432 --> 51:31.175
It's like a-- um,
operational expenses.

51:31.218 --> 51:32.785
How do we know
what you're spending

51:32.828 --> 51:35.004
this "operational cost?"

51:36.441 --> 51:38.791
You actually came here
in a private jet.

51:39.835 --> 51:42.795
And I know you got kids.
I mean, tuitions ain't cheep.

51:42.838 --> 51:45.058
And goddamn, with that suit.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.800
I've seen those before,
that's like, $5000 plus.

51:47.843 --> 51:50.759
Who's to say that you won't
take those luxuries

51:50.803 --> 51:53.893
and make them a part
of your "operational costs"?

51:53.936 --> 51:56.765
Can I just say, Your Majesty,

51:56.809 --> 52:02.771
that there will be a certain
amount of operational expenses

52:02.815 --> 52:06.819
eligible for yourself and all
of your Chiefs,

52:06.862 --> 52:10.475
prior to us assessing
whether we're going to profit.

52:10.518 --> 52:13.260
-Sounds like a bribe.
-Uh, sort of part
par for the course.

52:13.304 --> 52:15.219
Yeah, we're fair dinkum,
Your Majesty.

52:15.262 --> 52:18.570
How about I just hire
you guys for exploration?

52:19.527 --> 52:21.660
Because there's a lot of
oil companies out here

52:21.703 --> 52:26.143
that'd be very, very glad
to be paid just for taking
on the bidding,

52:26.186 --> 52:27.274
like the Chinese.

52:28.232 --> 52:29.624
Bastard Chinese.

52:35.543 --> 52:37.023
All right, you two.

52:38.285 --> 52:40.418
Tell me exactly
what the heck is going on.

52:41.767 --> 52:44.683
Well, Mr. Vice President,
let's start first.

52:45.640 --> 52:51.777
"Sabia," in classic Greek,
means prophetess or priestess.

52:51.820 --> 52:55.128
In Greek mythology,
it was said that a priestess

52:55.172 --> 52:57.391
saved the Pharaoh of Egypt,

52:57.435 --> 53:00.829
along with a substantial
portion of the ruling dynasty

53:00.873 --> 53:03.180
when Alexander the Great's
armies invaded Egypt.

53:03.223 --> 53:07.358
Now, she did this by leading
them across the Sahara,

53:07.401 --> 53:09.751
to the forested areas
of West Africa.

53:09.795 --> 53:14.278
What does this have to do
with US national security, huh?

53:14.321 --> 53:16.105
Well, sir, it doesn't.

53:16.149 --> 53:18.369
But in a way, it does.

53:18.412 --> 53:22.938
So, according
to this prophecy, the mythology

53:22.982 --> 53:25.767
is that the Oracle
has been to the US before.

53:25.811 --> 53:29.815
To the colony of Virginia,
before this country was founded.

53:29.858 --> 53:33.035
Now, the Oracle
is a divine spirit

53:33.079 --> 53:36.474
who guides
through the Priestess,
they're one and the same.

53:36.517 --> 53:39.912
And the Priestess in 1619,

53:39.955 --> 53:42.567
led the royal family
out of West Africa

53:42.610 --> 53:45.657
across the Niger River,
across the Atlantic Ocean,

53:45.700 --> 53:48.094
and to the colony of Virginia.

53:48.137 --> 53:50.749
In order to escape
the invasion of West Africa

53:50.792 --> 53:53.665
by the Portuguese and Spanish
during the slave riots.

53:55.144 --> 53:59.453
Greece, Africa, Virginia...

53:59.497 --> 54:01.238
Fake news.

54:01.281 --> 54:03.109
That's what I'm getting.

54:03.152 --> 54:05.242
This sounds like
other stories, fairy tales.

54:05.285 --> 54:08.723
You know what I need from
you two? I need proof.
Where's the proof?

54:08.767 --> 54:12.858
All right, Mr. Vice President,
let's start here,
a little closer to home.

54:12.901 --> 54:14.555
The Society of Friends.

54:14.599 --> 54:17.297
That was the beginning
of the abolitionist movement

54:17.341 --> 54:18.733
here in the United States.

54:18.777 --> 54:22.041
Now, they were founded in 1776,

54:22.084 --> 54:28.134
in reaction to when the Oracle
and the prophecy was omitted

54:28.177 --> 54:30.571
from the draft
of the American Constitution.

54:30.615 --> 54:32.617
Now, the same
Society of Friends,

54:32.660 --> 54:34.880
several decades later,

54:34.923 --> 54:37.361
they commissioned
a statue of civility.

54:37.404 --> 54:40.364
And when it's finished,
they ship it to Washington D.C.

54:40.407 --> 54:43.889
and they give it
to President Lincoln as a gift.

54:43.932 --> 54:46.021
It sparked
the Emancipation Proclamation.

54:47.109 --> 54:49.024
And subsequently the Civil War.

54:49.068 --> 54:52.071
After the assassination
of President Lincoln,

54:52.114 --> 54:56.162
President Johnson sent
the sculpture to New York,
and signed an executive order

54:56.205 --> 54:59.513
to classify all documents
and records of the Oracle

54:59.557 --> 55:02.299
and the Priestess,
as well as the prophecy.

55:02.342 --> 55:04.823
Those records
have been sealed since 1870.

55:04.866 --> 55:08.305
Look, I can't take this
fairy tale to the President.

55:08.348 --> 55:10.002
Okay? I need evidence.

55:10.045 --> 55:11.960
I need concrete proof.

55:12.004 --> 55:13.527
Where is the proof?

55:13.571 --> 55:16.356
The proof is
in the base of the statue.

55:16.400 --> 55:20.186
In the marble is chiseled
Sabalia's prophecy.

55:21.405 --> 55:24.321
Anything else?
What was the prophecy?

55:24.364 --> 55:28.194
-Hmm?
-Prophecy was that
she would return in 400 years.

55:28.237 --> 55:29.978
And when was this 400 years?

55:30.022 --> 55:32.720
This year, sir. The year 2020.

55:34.418 --> 55:38.552
Well, I need to see
this prophecy for myself.

55:38.596 --> 55:41.990
I'm not gonna take anything
to the President
that's not concrete.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.993
And if you say
that it's in marble,
I want to see it in marble.

55:45.037 --> 55:46.734
Where is it again?

55:46.778 --> 55:48.823
We understand the statue
is in the basement

55:48.867 --> 55:51.304
of the Metropolitan Museum
in New York.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.914
All right.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.176
Well, that's where I'll be.

55:55.482 --> 55:56.657
I'm gonna be there in an hour.

55:56.701 --> 55:57.615
Thank you.

56:00.618 --> 56:03.360
Nigga crazy. I think he really
thinks his kingdom came.

56:03.403 --> 56:05.884
Acting like
he's been Marcus Garvey.

56:05.927 --> 56:08.190
He's--
-Oh! Shit. Do you think
I'm a fool, man?

56:08.234 --> 56:10.715
Come on. We came out here to
have a good time and this fool
want to--

56:10.758 --> 56:12.325
want to rule the kingdom?

56:12.369 --> 56:13.761
-Right?
-She's got giraffes and shit.

56:13.805 --> 56:16.111
We know
your real name's Sebastian!

56:16.155 --> 56:17.852
Your name ain't no damn Akon!

56:17.896 --> 56:20.768
-Ass, yeah.
Sebastian...
-Yeah.

56:20.812 --> 56:25.164
You got these motherfuckers
fooled, you ain't got us fooled!
Tell your guards that.

56:25.207 --> 56:27.296
-Let's get out of here
before the guards come.
-

56:27.340 --> 56:29.081
-Oh, shit. Let's go.
-This got you tripping.

56:29.995 --> 56:32.127
Psst. Put that shit out, man.
Put it out!

56:46.881 --> 56:47.926
Got your back.

56:49.057 --> 56:49.971
Let's see.

56:52.409 --> 56:53.714
You little rebel.

56:55.150 --> 56:57.457
-Are you sure that's him?
-Positive.

56:57.501 --> 57:00.373
That's fine,
if you want to show him.

57:00.417 --> 57:02.114
-Is it good?
-Ah, it's better
than good, mate.

57:02.157 --> 57:03.507
You're not gonna believe this.

57:04.682 --> 57:07.119
Well, well.

57:07.162 --> 57:11.297
Oh! Straight A student
scholarship all the way
to postgrad at UCLA.

57:11.340 --> 57:13.995
-Goldman Sachs.
-Until he went to prison.

57:14.039 --> 57:17.869
After he got out,
no one would hire an ex-con,
so he was the one who did this.

57:17.912 --> 57:19.392
Name's Sebastian.

57:20.437 --> 57:21.960
Wait, how does
he come up with Akon?

57:23.527 --> 57:25.572
-Wanker.
-It's "Wan-kay."

57:25.616 --> 57:28.227
No, no, I mean this prick.
Just look at him.

57:28.270 --> 57:30.534
Well, it's not him.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.320
He's pretending
to be someone else.

57:35.234 --> 57:38.280
All we need to do is
threaten to expose his scam.

57:38.324 --> 57:40.761
If the locals found out the
truth, they'd probably eat him.

57:42.328 --> 57:44.852
Phone that horsehair
waving buffoon,

57:44.896 --> 57:46.767
Chief what's-his-name,
and tell him

57:46.811 --> 57:49.466
-we're about
to make him a king.
- I'm on it.

57:55.341 --> 57:58.953
-Wanker!
-Hey, hey, tosser!

57:58.997 --> 58:01.652
Yee-hee!

58:10.965 --> 58:13.794
Fantastic, Mr. Wanker.

58:13.838 --> 58:17.929
All right, fine, Mr. "Wan-kay"
Good news, good news.

58:17.972 --> 58:19.757
I'm really happy about this.

58:44.825 --> 58:48.873
I'm the King, but if you knew
what I was gonna tell you,
you wouldn't call me that.

58:48.916 --> 58:52.572
You've told us all
you've been locked up
for being a drug dealer.

58:52.616 --> 58:54.922
I'm not a drug dealer, okay?

58:54.966 --> 58:57.621
I had four joints that I was
holding for friends at a party.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.362
For four joints?

59:00.406 --> 59:02.190
As delicate
as those little fingers.

59:02.234 --> 59:04.062
But listen,
that's beside the point.

59:04.105 --> 59:07.282
Your Majesty! This is important.

59:07.326 --> 59:08.196
Yo.

59:09.589 --> 59:12.113
My nigga. I'm-- My nigga,
I need to holla at you.

59:12.157 --> 59:14.681
Yo. What did I tell you
about that word, man?
Why are you still using it?

59:15.769 --> 59:16.814
Come on, man.

59:17.771 --> 59:20.295
Your Majesty.
I need to talk to you.

59:20.339 --> 59:23.603
-All right, talk to me.
Tell me what you got to tell me.
-I can't.

59:23.647 --> 59:26.519
What do you mean you can't?
Of course you can. I just
said to tell me what--

59:26.563 --> 59:27.912
Dude, I'm just
tired of hiding shit!

59:27.955 --> 59:29.957
-Yeah? Yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah.

59:31.698 --> 59:32.917
What's this, man?

59:35.093 --> 59:39.358
I just saw them and they
asked me to confirm all this
and I couldn't lie.

59:39.401 --> 59:41.229
-Your Majesty?
-Later, later.

59:42.709 --> 59:44.189
-Your Majesty.
-Later!

59:46.060 --> 59:48.236
Just-- just
leave me for a minute.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.237
Leave!

59:55.635 --> 59:57.637
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

59:57.681 --> 1:00:00.684
-King... King...
King Sebastian, isn't it?
-Look. Look, look.

1:00:00.727 --> 1:00:02.686
-Isn't that ironic?
- I can explain.

1:00:02.729 --> 1:00:05.384
He was the Roman saint
bludgeoned to death
in the Senate,

1:00:05.427 --> 1:00:08.735
in front of his own emperor.
That's apt, isn't it?

1:00:08.779 --> 1:00:11.129
Now, I'm sure you can explain.
I'm all ears.

1:00:11.172 --> 1:00:14.132
So is the population
and half of the UN.

1:00:14.175 --> 1:00:17.744
Now, we have adjusted
our offer, as you requested.

1:00:17.788 --> 1:00:20.878
It now includes
a first class plane ticket,

1:00:20.921 --> 1:00:26.318
a passport and a very generous
compensation package
upon signature.

1:00:26.361 --> 1:00:29.626
Now, we withhold this
information for 24 hours,

1:00:29.669 --> 1:00:34.108
by which time you will be
a millionaire, out of jail,

1:00:34.152 --> 1:00:37.851
and still in one piece,
leaving us to crack on.

1:00:37.895 --> 1:00:39.548
Pleasure doing
business with you.

1:01:01.353 --> 1:01:02.789
Are you crazy?

1:01:02.833 --> 1:01:04.791
They're offering you
millions of dollars.

1:01:04.835 --> 1:01:07.446
All you got to do is
sign the paper and we're rich!

1:01:07.489 --> 1:01:09.361
We go back
to America, we're balling.

1:01:09.404 --> 1:01:12.581
Dawg, it's the first time that
we felt home being somewhere.

1:01:12.625 --> 1:01:14.932
We ain't got to watch our back.
We ain't got to hustle.

1:01:14.975 --> 1:01:17.108
These people accepted
us as family, bro.

1:01:17.151 --> 1:01:19.284
What are you talking about?
You're not even the real king!

1:01:19.327 --> 1:01:20.894
I just can't do it.

1:01:20.938 --> 1:01:23.244
You see? See,
Pewee has some damn sense.

1:01:23.288 --> 1:01:25.072
That's why he got
the hell up out of here.

1:01:25.116 --> 1:01:27.161
I'm your only friend!

1:01:27.205 --> 1:01:30.425
I'm all you have left here,
bro, it's right here.

1:01:30.469 --> 1:01:32.036
Let's get the money
and let's leave.

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:34.081
I just can't.

1:01:35.517 --> 1:01:37.476
They're gonna kill you, man.

1:01:37.519 --> 1:01:39.130
And I ain't gonna
be here when they do.

1:01:40.392 --> 1:01:43.090
Look, they offered me
a plane ticket and some cash.

1:01:43.134 --> 1:01:46.006
I'm gonna take it.
I'm going.

1:01:46.964 --> 1:01:48.400
Sebastian.

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:52.099
He's right, you know.

1:01:54.841 --> 1:01:59.150
They'll kill you. In the room,
if you say anything,

1:01:59.193 --> 1:02:00.673
they'll tear you apart.

1:02:02.066 --> 1:02:03.458
These people are animals.

1:02:05.634 --> 1:02:08.289
This ain't the ghetto.
This is the jungle.

1:02:10.988 --> 1:02:12.206
Mr. President.

1:02:13.164 --> 1:02:16.254
Every bit of information
I come across

1:02:16.297 --> 1:02:20.171
points to the Oracle being real
and very powerful.

1:02:20.214 --> 1:02:23.478
It's an entity who works through
a divine and chosen Priestess.

1:02:24.523 --> 1:02:28.266
2000 years ago, she saved the
Pharaoh and the ruling dynasty

1:02:28.309 --> 1:02:31.835
from the destruction of the
armies of Alexander the Great.

1:02:31.878 --> 1:02:35.447
And for over 1000 years, they
lived in peace and prosperity

1:02:35.490 --> 1:02:37.536
on the banks of the Niger River.

1:02:37.579 --> 1:02:39.799
Until about 1619,

1:02:39.843 --> 1:02:43.237
when the Portuguese and Spanish
invaded Western Africa.

1:02:43.281 --> 1:02:46.632
It was at this time during
this invasion that the Oracle

1:02:46.675 --> 1:02:48.590
saved the royal family

1:02:48.634 --> 1:02:51.811
by sailing them across
the Atlantic Ocean to Virginia.

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.900
Do you really believe
this, Malcolm?

1:02:53.944 --> 1:02:55.859
Uh, yes, sir.

1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:59.079
It's written in stone
at the Metropolitan Museum.

1:02:59.950 --> 1:03:01.342
I've seen it with my own eyes.

1:03:03.257 --> 1:03:06.870
I believe it's as if
the Oracle has revealed
this information to us,

1:03:06.913 --> 1:03:10.221
and that we never would
have known otherwise.

1:03:10.264 --> 1:03:12.397
It's sort of like the, uh,

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:14.442
story of Joseph in the Bibles.

1:03:14.486 --> 1:03:17.315
So, what would you advise I do?

1:03:17.358 --> 1:03:20.535
Well, about this situation,
I'd... say one thing.

1:03:20.579 --> 1:03:22.450
It's an election here, sir.

1:03:22.494 --> 1:03:25.932
And this could be
very helpful politically.

1:03:25.976 --> 1:03:28.369
It's in our best interest to...

1:03:28.413 --> 1:03:30.632
protect Sebastian.

1:03:30.676 --> 1:03:34.898
Help him rebuild Africa
as a way of reparations for

1:03:34.941 --> 1:03:39.119
400 years of slavery
and oppression in America.

1:03:39.163 --> 1:03:43.167
And I believe with
this effort this will help
the African-American vote

1:03:43.210 --> 1:03:45.430
to go back
to the Republican Party.

1:03:46.866 --> 1:03:50.478
Mr. President,
history would remember you

1:03:50.522 --> 1:03:53.568
as the man who made
Africa great again.

1:03:53.612 --> 1:03:55.701
I mean, do you
understand that, sir?

1:03:55.744 --> 1:03:59.879
You will do the one thing
that nobody has ever done

1:03:59.923 --> 1:04:02.099
in the history of the world.

1:04:02.142 --> 1:04:05.058
Made Africa
a whole sovereign nation.

1:04:05.102 --> 1:04:09.280
And given it its
own independence from
White European influence.

1:04:09.323 --> 1:04:12.544
What's so great about
this Alejandro guy?

1:04:12.587 --> 1:04:14.502
And why do they call him great?

1:04:14.546 --> 1:04:17.897
-He's, uh, a conqueror--
-I think he's
Alexander the Liar.

1:04:19.116 --> 1:04:22.989
-Yes.
-He never met the Priestess
in the Libyan desert.

1:04:23.033 --> 1:04:24.904
I'm the chosen one.

1:04:24.948 --> 1:04:27.907
-The Priestess returns
during my presidency.
-Yes.

1:04:27.951 --> 1:04:30.692
I'll be the greatest president
in the history of the world.

1:04:30.736 --> 1:04:34.871
Europe's been sucking the breast
of Africa for far too long.

1:04:34.914 --> 1:04:38.265
400 years is long enough.
We're cutting off their aid.

1:04:38.309 --> 1:04:40.920
And a few other parts,
if you get my drift.

1:04:43.183 --> 1:04:45.882
I told the European leaders
at the NATO meeting,

1:04:45.925 --> 1:04:47.579
especially the French president,

1:04:47.622 --> 1:04:50.364
the US will no longer
spend taxpayer money

1:04:50.408 --> 1:04:52.410
protecting their interests
in Africa anymore.

1:04:52.453 --> 1:04:55.456
I'll withdraw
all US troops from Africa.

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:56.893
You know what?

1:04:58.068 --> 1:05:00.809
I never liked
President George Washington.

1:05:00.853 --> 1:05:05.205
Some third rate historians claim
that he's the richest president
of all time.

1:05:05.249 --> 1:05:07.555
Well, I'm here
to tell you that he's not.

1:05:07.599 --> 1:05:10.428
I'm the richest
president of all time.

1:05:10.471 --> 1:05:12.996
George Washington
had plantations.

1:05:13.039 --> 1:05:15.694
He was a slave owner
and he was racist.

1:05:15.737 --> 1:05:19.393
I didn't like that other
fella either. Jefferson.

1:05:19.437 --> 1:05:22.831
-The one that had sex
with all the Black girls.
-Yeah.

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:25.486
I really loved
President Abraham Lincoln.

1:05:25.530 --> 1:05:30.709
He freed the slaves and won
the war. And I love winners.

1:05:30.752 --> 1:05:33.581
That was a great win
for the United States.

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:36.280
-The Civil War.
- I love his attitude.

1:05:36.323 --> 1:05:39.326
I never liked
President Andrew Johnson.

1:05:39.370 --> 1:05:42.677
Sleazy, crazy Johnson's
what I like to call him.

1:05:42.721 --> 1:05:46.638
I bet he had something to do
with the assassination
of President Lincoln.

1:05:46.681 --> 1:05:50.555
My foundation
has donated so much

1:05:50.598 --> 1:05:52.557
to the Metropolitan Museum.

1:05:53.775 --> 1:05:56.213
Can-- can I see your pictures?

1:05:56.256 --> 1:05:58.345
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1:05:58.389 --> 1:06:01.348
We have a picture
of the Priestess.

1:06:01.392 --> 1:06:04.177
She's pretty hot.

1:06:04.221 --> 1:06:06.092
When do I get to meet her?

1:06:06.136 --> 1:06:07.441
Very soon.

1:06:07.485 --> 1:06:10.009
This is her now. 2020.

1:06:10.053 --> 1:06:12.969
I don't know what she uses,
maybe a lot of cocoa butter.

1:06:13.012 --> 1:06:14.535
Yeah.
-There's another one right here.

1:06:14.579 --> 1:06:18.409
The statue of her
in Metropolitan Museum.

1:06:18.452 --> 1:06:19.976
She's not wearing a bra.

1:06:20.977 --> 1:06:22.674
I'm sorry, sir.

1:06:22.717 --> 1:06:26.069
She'll be back
in 400 years to choose a king.

1:06:26.112 --> 1:06:28.419
These are the maps
of her travels,

1:06:28.462 --> 1:06:30.551
leading them
from the area of Egypt

1:06:30.595 --> 1:06:33.685
down to the Niger River.

1:06:33.728 --> 1:06:35.861
Did you draw this?

1:06:35.904 --> 1:06:37.036
I did, actually.

1:06:38.081 --> 1:06:41.084
And here's a map of Africa.

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:46.089
We get Sebastian to unite
all these nations here.

1:06:46.132 --> 1:06:47.742
-Hmm.
-When you do that, sir,

1:06:47.786 --> 1:06:50.397
you will be the greatest
man in history.

1:06:50.441 --> 1:06:52.617
I'll be the greatest president
of all time, won't I?

1:06:52.660 --> 1:06:54.401
All time, sir.

1:06:54.445 --> 1:06:58.362
You will be the one man
who made Africa great again.

1:07:03.802 --> 1:07:05.456
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:07:05.499 --> 1:07:08.285
I-- I have, I have--
What do you call one of them?

1:07:08.328 --> 1:07:09.982
-Hi-- uh, Holiness.
-Your Holiness.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:12.941
I don't think that we've
actually been introduced.

1:07:14.465 --> 1:07:16.510
I know who you are, Mr. Wanker.

1:07:16.554 --> 1:07:19.731
Uh, it's "Wan-kay", um...
Wow.

1:07:19.774 --> 1:07:22.342
It seems
I underestimated His Majesty

1:07:22.386 --> 1:07:26.129
and I may have
underestimated his people.

1:07:26.172 --> 1:07:29.219
So I suppose what
I'm asking you for is, uh...

1:07:30.611 --> 1:07:32.744
Would you furnish me
with some advice?

1:07:33.745 --> 1:07:37.140
You don't seem to try
to understand his people.

1:07:38.228 --> 1:07:40.186
Ever heard of
emotional intelligence?

1:07:42.232 --> 1:07:43.755
Bye, Mr. Wanker.

1:07:45.670 --> 1:07:47.280
Bye.

1:07:47.324 --> 1:07:50.544
"Wan-kay." I, um...
understand the people.

1:07:52.981 --> 1:07:53.982
Look that up.

1:08:00.032 --> 1:08:02.600
Uh, hello, Your Majesty.

1:08:02.643 --> 1:08:06.038
I am Vice President
Malcolm Youngblood.

1:08:06.082 --> 1:08:09.955
I'm honored to call you
on behalf of the President
of the United States.

1:08:09.998 --> 1:08:12.088
He wishes to congratulate you.

1:08:12.958 --> 1:08:15.874
Mr. President is so proud,
as is the entire nation, that

1:08:15.917 --> 1:08:19.660
that an American citizen
was chosen to become king.

1:08:21.053 --> 1:08:23.447
And, Your Majesty,
on a personal note,

1:08:23.490 --> 1:08:25.449
I just wanted
to say this is, uh...

1:08:27.190 --> 1:08:28.843
the happiest day of my life.

1:08:32.195 --> 1:08:33.239
Where are they?

1:08:34.893 --> 1:08:37.113
-How you dey? How--
- I dey!

1:08:38.114 --> 1:08:40.681
-How you dey?
-I dey!

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:45.947
-I understand the people.
How you dey?
-Hey!

1:08:51.866 --> 1:08:54.130
Fellow Americans,

1:08:54.173 --> 1:08:56.349
as you may all be aware,

1:08:56.393 --> 1:09:01.354
the news of the arrival
of the Oracle to our nation

1:09:01.398 --> 1:09:04.314
has been on all major news
and social media.

1:09:04.357 --> 1:09:09.101
I've just
received a briefing from
the National Security Council

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:11.582
that it is indeed true

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:16.630
that an American citizen
has been chosen by the Oracle

1:09:16.674 --> 1:09:20.808
to be the new king
in the Kingdom of Africa.

1:09:20.852 --> 1:09:23.985
I have spoken
with His Majesty the King

1:09:24.029 --> 1:09:27.380
and I have told him
how proud I am,

1:09:27.424 --> 1:09:32.255
as is the entire nation
to have an American king.

1:09:32.298 --> 1:09:36.389
Tonight... I signed
the executive order

1:09:36.433 --> 1:09:40.176
that authorizes
Vice President Youngblood

1:09:40.219 --> 1:09:42.917
to lead
a White House delegation,

1:09:42.961 --> 1:09:45.790
along with
congressional leaders,

1:09:45.833 --> 1:09:50.229
to Africa for
the coronation of the new king.

1:09:50.273 --> 1:09:54.190
I've also put forth
an executive bill to Congress...

1:09:55.103 --> 1:09:59.195
called the African
Renaissance and Reparation Act.

1:09:59.238 --> 1:10:04.461
Requesting Congress to gift $1
trillion to the American King.

1:10:05.331 --> 1:10:08.856
This will be used
to protect and rebuild Africa

1:10:08.900 --> 1:10:11.816
as a form of reparations

1:10:11.859 --> 1:10:14.601
for 400 years of slavery.

1:10:14.645 --> 1:10:17.256
May God bless
the United States of America...

1:10:18.301 --> 1:10:20.694
and make Africa great again.
