00:06.267 --> 00:08.834
MacGYVER:
I thought you liked
chilaquiles. Too spicy?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.447
I... I don't have an appetite.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.712
We need to talk about
what happened in Mexico City.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.238
Look, I saw the ring, so...

00:23.110 --> 00:25.199
...were you really gonna
ask me to marry you?

00:26.852 --> 00:28.767
Yes.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.639
I made the ring myself.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.902
For you.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.469
I brought it to
Mexico City so that

00:34.512 --> 00:35.818
we could find a private
place somewhere

00:35.861 --> 00:38.255
on a beach or a
bridge or a cliff.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.430
Then I ended up
having to use it

00:39.474 --> 00:41.215
to cut a hole in
a glass window

00:41.258 --> 00:42.694
to avoid being buried alive
by falling chunks of skyscraper.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.696
Thanks, Murdoc. I know
it's not the story

00:44.740 --> 00:46.829
that you want to tell your
kids, but at the same time...Kids?

00:46.872 --> 00:49.136
I mean, we haven't even
talked about marriage yet.Well... That's...

00:49.179 --> 00:50.876
not what I...

00:50.920 --> 00:52.052
[sighs]

00:53.836 --> 00:55.620
I wanted it to
be a surprise.

00:55.664 --> 00:58.667
But you don't go
from barely dating to engaged

00:58.710 --> 00:59.929
without even, like, a hint of...

00:59.972 --> 01:01.452
Barely dating?

01:01.496 --> 01:03.454
I thought we were
in a good place.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.108
No, we are.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.980
We're in such a good place.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.895
But... come on, marriage?

01:09.939 --> 01:11.332
Okay.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.768
[sighs]

01:12.811 --> 01:15.466
Look, after Codex...

01:16.685 --> 01:18.687
I just didn't want
to lose you, too.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.167
So call it fear,

01:20.210 --> 01:23.344
or foolishness...Look, I was engaged before.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.740
Uh... what?

01:28.784 --> 01:31.308
To... to who?

01:31.352 --> 01:34.616
Um, to someone in my unit.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.922
What happened?

01:39.055 --> 01:41.057
Uh...[phones vibrates]

01:44.278 --> 01:45.801
It's Matty.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.629
We got to go.I mean... Yeah.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.805
Uh, but-but you just told me
that you were engaged before,

01:49.848 --> 01:53.025
so there's definitely a part two
to this conversation. Right?

01:54.244 --> 01:55.550
Yeah.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.901
â™ª

02:20.183 --> 02:22.185
MATTY: The press has dubbed
the upcoming nuptials

02:22.229 --> 02:23.969
of Princess Rani Kumari

02:24.013 --> 02:27.190
and the British prime minster's
son Oliver Hughes

02:27.234 --> 02:28.974
"RaOliver's Rockin' Wedding."

02:29.018 --> 02:30.976
Ever since Oliver proposed

02:31.020 --> 02:32.978
on the Tower Bridge,
these two have become

02:33.022 --> 02:35.067
social media's new it couple.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.504
Their star-studded guest list

02:36.547 --> 02:38.593
has garnered
some unwanted attention

02:38.636 --> 02:39.855
in the form of threats.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.204
What kind of threats?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.640
Bomb, hostage,

02:42.684 --> 02:43.772
death threats.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.382
But our good friends at Interpol

02:45.426 --> 02:48.516
and MI6 say some of these
threats could be credible.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.605
As a result, there should be
heightened security

02:50.648 --> 02:52.781
at the wedding, but
the king of Bikaner is insisting

02:52.824 --> 02:55.610
that only his royal guard
be entrusted with the task.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.134
MacGYVER: I don't understand.
It only makes sense

02:58.178 --> 03:00.702
to bring in additional security.
Am I wrong?

03:00.745 --> 03:02.182
His pride won't allow it.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.227
Especially since
the moment Rani says "I do,"

03:04.271 --> 03:06.490
she becomes queen of Bikaner.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.492
King Sunil doesn't want
to appear weak--

03:08.536 --> 03:10.712
as if he can't protect
his own daughter.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.801
Not only will Rani be given
the keys to the kingdom,

03:12.844 --> 03:14.977
but she will also take
over the family's

03:15.020 --> 03:16.892
rather lucrative
mineral business.

03:16.935 --> 03:20.678
And contrary to her father's
isolationist policies,

03:20.722 --> 03:23.681
Rani's gone on record
as saying that

03:23.725 --> 03:26.989
she will open Bikaner's zinc
supplies to the global market,

03:27.032 --> 03:29.948
creating an international
trade mecca.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.254
Wakanda Forever.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.690
Yeah. Yes.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.040
Rani's rather
forward-thinking.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.042
Extremist groups
in Bikaner

03:37.086 --> 03:39.306
oppose opening trade
with the West,

03:39.349 --> 03:41.612
fearing a new form
of neocolonialism.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.615
And a few outspoken critics
in Great Britain

03:44.659 --> 03:47.096
have also scrutinized
Oliver's choice in a bride,

03:47.139 --> 03:50.142
saying that she doesn't exactly
"fit the mold."

03:50.186 --> 03:51.796
RILEY: Sounds like
the same B.S.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.277
they gave Meghan Markle
for marrying Prince Harry.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.888
And so with criticism
on both sides,

03:56.932 --> 03:59.282
Rani, Oliver,
and the prime minister

03:59.326 --> 04:01.676
could all be facing
very serious danger.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.287
Which is why we've been asked
by our key allies

04:04.331 --> 04:07.421
to make sure that these nuptials
go off without a hitch.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.597
Yes. Only glitch is that, um,

04:09.640 --> 04:11.686
the wedding is by invite only.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.601
Oh. Well, give me a second.
I can fix that.

04:13.644 --> 04:14.776
MacGYVER:
So...

04:14.819 --> 04:16.343
who's going on the op?

04:16.386 --> 04:19.607
Given the intel,
it has to be Desi, Russ,

04:19.650 --> 04:21.435
and you, Blondie.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.740
Okay.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.702
TAYLOR:
Ah.

04:27.745 --> 04:28.964
Backfilled I.D.s.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.967
Full control over
your identities.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.142
You don't need backfills, okay?

04:33.185 --> 04:34.317
You're all going in

04:34.361 --> 04:35.318
as high-profile
civilians.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.885
Getting a
plus-three

04:36.928 --> 04:37.973
to the wedding of the century
was a nonstarter.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.627
So I found three invitees

04:39.670 --> 04:41.846
with the least amount
of connections.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.239
All RSVPed "no,"

04:43.283 --> 04:45.023
but with a few
keyboard strokes,

04:45.067 --> 04:46.547
they had a sudden
change of heart.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.939
Desi, you're
going as Tien Ly,

04:47.983 --> 04:49.680
heiress to
the Ly Hotel empire.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.987
BOZER:
Mac, meet Prince Willem,

04:52.030 --> 04:53.597
Count of Bardi,

04:53.641 --> 04:55.338
extended member
of the Dutch royal family.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.384
[speaking Dutch]

05:01.475 --> 05:03.607
You speak Dutch?Yeah.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.087
BOZER:
Right. And, Russ,

05:05.130 --> 05:08.220
you'll be Lord Dougal MacTavish.TAYLOR: Ah!

05:08.264 --> 05:10.919
Love a good Scotch.30 years sober
spokesperson

05:10.962 --> 05:13.574
for the often-ignored
Temperance Movement.

05:13.617 --> 05:14.966
Right. I would like to exercise

05:15.010 --> 05:16.141
my owner veto here.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.142
That's not a thing.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.448
All right.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.841
Sending you all
the dossiers now.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.625
Study up.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.366
You'll be rubbing elbows with
some of the world's elite.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.544
MacGYVER: Hey, Matty, uh,
I was just gonna say

05:27.588 --> 05:29.503
if we divide and conquer
the recon,

05:29.546 --> 05:31.809
I can send you the vendor photos
from the cocktail hour.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.289
MATTY:
Send them to Bozer.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.725
He'll be running the op.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.771
TAYLOR: Hang on
a second, Matty.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.687
Um, why the, uh,
why the sudden change in plan?

05:39.730 --> 05:43.343
I just got an urgent lead
on the nano-trackers.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.954
Riley found research
of other blood samples

05:45.997 --> 05:47.956
from the protest
and throughout Banja Luka.

05:47.999 --> 05:52.003
This number, 48114,

05:52.047 --> 05:53.657
is singular to the region.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.964
So President Petrovic
must have ordered his scientists

05:56.007 --> 05:57.748
to develop more nano-trackers

05:57.792 --> 06:00.055
to sell to other countries
monitoring dissidents.

06:00.098 --> 06:01.186
That's what I thought.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.797
Until I spoke with my contacts

06:02.840 --> 06:04.538
in the Republika Srpska
government,

06:04.581 --> 06:07.062
who confirmed that this tech
was not created in-country

06:07.105 --> 06:09.673
and was only given
as a trial run.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.414
Given?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
By whom?Well, that's
the million dollar question

06:13.329 --> 06:15.940
that only members
of Petrovic's inner circle

06:15.984 --> 06:18.160
can answer.So let's go pay them a visit.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.640
MATTY:
Wearen't doing anything.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.337
I need you all focused
on that wedding.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.513
Right.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.648
I cancelled all your meetings.

06:27.691 --> 06:28.953
Good.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.390
Ever since Petrovic resigned,

06:30.433 --> 06:32.130
the rats are jumping ship.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.045
We need to see which of
these lackeys will flip

06:34.089 --> 06:35.569
so we can find the broker

06:35.612 --> 06:37.614
and get this nano-tech
out of Mac and Riley.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.659
Let's do this.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.357
Given the cult of personality,

06:41.401 --> 06:42.880
that's not going to be easy.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.187
You didn't mention
it's President Handshakes.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.450
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.843
Petrovic-- it's a nickname

06:48.886 --> 06:49.931
he was given online
a few years ago

06:49.974 --> 06:51.454
from the super aggro way

06:51.498 --> 06:52.934
he shakes everyone's hands.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.631
Check it out
once this is all over.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.809
Actually, Parker, I'd like
to see that footage right now.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.507
I'll get techs right on it.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.596
[Indian music playing]

07:07.252 --> 07:09.907
â™ª

07:14.477 --> 07:16.479
[indistinct chatter]

07:18.525 --> 07:19.874
[detector whining]

07:21.179 --> 07:22.485
Is that a mango Cosmo?

07:22.529 --> 07:25.314
No, it's a mango
lassi Bellini.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.272
You're such a lightweight.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.971
Mac, Desi-- looks like Russ
got the short stick

07:30.014 --> 07:31.538
and was randomly selected
for a pat-down.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.018
Well, I hope
his cover sticks.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.150
MacGYVER:
I'm pretty sure

07:35.193 --> 07:36.194
Russ Taylor can
talk himself

07:36.238 --> 07:37.108
out of any
situation.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.938
You... look stunning,
by the way.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.636
Thank you.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.507
Kinda digging your outfit,
too, Prince Willem.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.987
Oh, just, uh...[giggles]

07:47.162 --> 07:48.511
Our covers are intact.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.165
We are officially in.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.775
Perfect.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.865
WOMAN:
Russ Taylor?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.955
Ah.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.479
Sofia.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.272
All right. So...
Camel polo? What?

08:10.315 --> 08:13.362
Wow, and then tea with the
prime minister, pinkies up.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.538
And then a baraat.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.844
What's a baraat?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.367
Well, it says here
it's a parade

08:18.410 --> 08:20.935
where the groom rides
in on a white horse

08:20.978 --> 08:22.980
or an elephant.Doubt it'll be the latter.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.243
Why do you say that?Well, Princess Rani's charity

08:25.287 --> 08:27.898
raises money to protect
endangered Asian elephants.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.640
Oh...

08:30.684 --> 08:32.555
Speaking of the
elephant in the room...

08:32.599 --> 08:35.384
I don't mean to
pry about your ex,

08:35.427 --> 08:38.039
but you being engaged before,
it's-it's kind of a big deal.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.737
Yeah, I know.
But it's a long story, Mac.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.391
I mean, we have the whole
weekend to talk about it.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.566
Might as well get
it out of the way.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.915
And I just want
to make sure

08:44.959 --> 08:46.395
that I don't make
the same mistake.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.049
Whatever he did to
make you break off...

08:48.092 --> 08:49.964
He didn't do anything.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.576
He died.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.843
[sighs]

08:59.887 --> 09:01.323
I'm sorry, Des. I...

09:02.454 --> 09:04.021
[choked up]:
Well, now you know.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.763
So can we please
just give it a rest?

09:08.591 --> 09:10.462
â™ª

09:10.506 --> 09:11.681
TAYLOR:
Yes, I do believe
it's been some time

09:11.725 --> 09:13.117
since quarantine.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.119
Lord Dougal MacTavish?

09:15.163 --> 09:16.904
What is the owner of
a think tank doing

09:16.947 --> 09:18.775
parading around as the head
of the Temperance Movement?

09:18.819 --> 09:21.082
Well, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you

09:21.125 --> 09:22.866
and I don't want
to commit murder.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.607
Except maybe that chap.
What on earth has he got on?

09:24.651 --> 09:26.696
Look at the size
of his crest.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.437
It's absolutely enormous.
Must be trying

09:28.480 --> 09:29.960
to overcompensate.Russ, if I didn't
know you better,

09:30.004 --> 09:31.527
I'd say...
It's Dougal.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.051
Dougal, Dougal, Dougal
the entire weekend, all right?

09:34.095 --> 09:37.272
And what if I don't play
along, Lord MacTavish?

09:37.315 --> 09:39.361
Oh, I do rather like
the sound of that.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.363
Is that why you snuck off?
Left me...
Darling.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.147
Been looking
all over for you.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.628
SOFIA:
I was just, uh, catching
up with an old friend.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.716
Let me introduce you.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.065
This is Rudolf Von Stupensen,

09:48.109 --> 09:49.850
the Vice Count of Austria.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.373
And, Rudy, may I present...

09:51.416 --> 09:54.115
Lord Dougal MacTavish.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.946
[indistinct chatter]

09:58.989 --> 10:00.251
RILEY:
Okay.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.862
Okay, give me just a second.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.472
Getting a live feed now.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.259
A few have stints in prison
for minor crimes.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.652
No red flags.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.088
MacGYVER:
Copy that.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
I may need backup
at the courtyard.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.752
[exhales]

10:24.101 --> 10:26.277
Abort.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.410
What does it say
about me if I think

10:28.453 --> 10:29.977
a silver domed plate
has a gun under it,

10:30.020 --> 10:31.282
not delicious rice?

10:31.326 --> 10:33.110
It says that you're good
at your job.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.637
Mm.
Hi.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.421
My fault.
I'm in the way.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.336
It's just so good fresh.
[laughs]

10:41.379 --> 10:43.077
The Pithi ceremony
is amazing,

10:43.120 --> 10:45.079
but if I don't get
something in my stomach

10:45.122 --> 10:47.385
before I get my face rubbed
with turmeric paste

10:47.429 --> 10:49.126
for an hour,
I may faint.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.606
Well, it's your wedding.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.781
I'm sure you could
push it back an hour.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.740
[laughs]
I have no say in the matter.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.481
Just like I had little say
in the guest list, so...

10:58.266 --> 11:02.357
Are you here to get on my dad's
or Oliver's dad's good side?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.359
Well, getting on your good side
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.839
I'm Rani.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.275
Tien Ly.
Ah,

11:07.318 --> 11:08.624
the hotel empire.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
Can I offer you
and Oliver a stay

11:10.278 --> 11:12.367
at any of our royalty
suites for your honeymoon?

11:12.410 --> 11:14.412
Security's already
planned it for us.

11:14.456 --> 11:17.546
Hey, Ran, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.069
I can't make the Pithi.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.898
Doing a helicopter tour.
Have fun.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.248
No worries, Elise. Have fun.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.775
[whispers]:
My fiancÃ©'s ex-girlfriend.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.473
I've got to go.
Wedding machine never stops.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.866
But it was really nice
to meet you.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.302
You, too.Bye.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.784
Established contact
with the princess.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.133
Super nice, by the way.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.354
[Scottish accent]:
Do you mind if I just
borrow the lassie there

11:43.398 --> 11:45.356
for a wee minute there?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.575
I'll catch up.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.840
[regular accent]:
So, did you tell him about us?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.624
There's no "us."

11:52.668 --> 11:54.365
Well, I think April of last
year would beg to differ.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.367
It was a special circumstance.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.195
People did a lot
of strange things in quarantine.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.501
Strange, was it?

12:01.764 --> 12:03.070
Is that why you left

12:03.113 --> 12:07.204
without so much
as a "Fare thee well," hmm?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.380
BOZER:
Desi, Taylor,
get to the loading dock.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.121
Someone's trying
to kidnap the princess.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.557
[whimpers]

12:12.601 --> 12:13.776
[shouting in Hindi]

12:16.561 --> 12:18.563
[Rani screams]

12:18.607 --> 12:20.522
[gunfire continues]

12:25.179 --> 12:26.223
[shouting in Hindi]

12:32.055 --> 12:33.622
[screams]

12:34.841 --> 12:35.798
[engine revving]

12:46.461 --> 12:48.115
MacGYVER:
It's one of the flower vendors.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.117
Hands up.[gun clicks]

12:50.160 --> 12:51.205
You're under arrest for
the attempted kidnapping

12:51.248 --> 12:52.772
of Princess Rani.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.654
NITESH:
As head of the royal guard,

13:05.697 --> 13:07.351
the Bikaner government agrees
that your punishment

13:07.395 --> 13:08.918
lies in my hands.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.615
Call Wilt Bozer
at the Phoenix Foundation.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.356
We had nothing to do with Rani's
attempted kidnapping.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.836
The optics say otherwise.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.185
DESI:
You would be conducting
a very public

13:15.229 --> 13:16.839
princess hunt right
now without us.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.406
How about a thank-you?

13:18.449 --> 13:20.887
RANI:
Nitesh, let them go.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.192
They saved me.NITESH:
All due respect,

13:22.236 --> 13:23.454
they're trespassing imposters.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.847
You are mistaken.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.240
This is Tien Ly.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.852
Actually, my name
is Desi Nguyen.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.246
This is Russ Taylor
and Angus MacGyver.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.638
We're here as extra security.TAYLOR:
As a favor

13:33.682 --> 13:36.685
to our friends at
MI6 and Interpol.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.166
In case anything
like this happened.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.908
I'm sorry I lied to you,
but we were undercover.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.519
Lucky me, I guess.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.435
Nitesh, uncuff them now.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.699
SUMITA:
I'm Rani's guardian

13:50.742 --> 13:52.657
and the king's top advisor.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.008
We owe you a debt of gratitude.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.010
Anything you need,
please let us know.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.576
MacGYVER:
Well, we would
like to run

13:58.620 --> 14:00.274
the background checks
on the vendors ourselves,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.493
and we'll need a complete list
to do that.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.713
Absolutely.
Did you hear him?

14:14.897 --> 14:18.335
Your partner told us everything.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.685
[speaking Hindi]

14:20.729 --> 14:22.600
Corroborate the name
and location of your boss,

14:22.644 --> 14:25.168
and you'll see daylight again
before you turn 90.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.257
[speaking Hindi]

14:35.004 --> 14:36.266
Cut the A/C.

14:37.615 --> 14:41.184
We'll be back
in a few very hot hours.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.188
How'd it go?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.321
Oh, he's one of those
"die before they talk" types.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.279
Not a fan. Any progress here?

14:49.323 --> 14:51.978
Mr. Head of the Royal
Guard himself, Nitesh,

14:52.021 --> 14:54.023
is a member of The Blue Arrow,
one the region's

14:54.067 --> 14:55.851
extremist groups hell-bent
on isolationism.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.853
MacGYVER:
Which not only
gives him access

14:57.897 --> 15:00.334
and opportunity as
the head of security,

15:00.377 --> 15:01.901
but now we have motive as well.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.467
Yes, he seemed rather
keen to get rid of us.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.426
We also flagged
one of Oliver's exes

15:05.469 --> 15:08.298
as a suspect,
Elise Deveroux.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.518
She has bad blood with Rani.
I saw it with my own eyes.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.302
Guys, I just found
a wire transfer

15:12.346 --> 15:13.738
sent from the palace grounds

15:13.782 --> 15:15.175
an hour before
the kidnapping attempt,

15:15.218 --> 15:16.828
and you're not gonna guess
who it's from.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.005
Oliver's trust fund.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.355
Two million rupees to a
local real estate company

15:21.398 --> 15:22.965
for 3,000 acres.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.707
BOZER:
Maybe Oliver's not
doing the buying.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.753
His mom Bella has business ties
to overseas big pharma.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.407
MacGYVER:
And the zinc-rich land
could yield a steady profit

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
in that industry.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.716
So Bella's using her son's
engagement to broker a deal

15:34.759 --> 15:36.674
that otherwise would've
been impossible.Wait. [shushes]

15:36.718 --> 15:39.155
[whispers]:
Guys. Guys.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.940
Someone's listening.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.948
[laughs]
Sofia!

15:48.991 --> 15:51.298
I really want to talk to you,
but, uh, now is not a good time.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.996
Um...Really, Russ, I can see feet

15:54.040 --> 15:55.519
under the drapes.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.913
TAYLOR:
Uh...

15:57.957 --> 16:00.133
Ah. You both must work
for Russel's think tank.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.136
Ooh, this is gonna be good.
Riley, look.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.312
SOFIA:
I'm Sofia.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.836
I'm sure he's told you
all about me.[laughs]

16:07.879 --> 16:10.491
Taylor and his booty call again.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.883
Guess he had
it coming.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.668
DESI:
Clearly you two have

16:13.711 --> 16:15.452
some catching up to do, so...

16:18.064 --> 16:20.022
We will be speaking
to the groom.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.893
See what Oliver knows.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.768
To what do I owe this pleasure?

16:26.811 --> 16:30.337
I wanted to talk to you.
In private.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.512
I really want to know
the real reason

16:31.555 --> 16:33.296
why you left during quarantine.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.341
Don't think I didn't
have a good time.

16:34.384 --> 16:36.212
So, then, why did you leave?

16:36.256 --> 16:37.648
I needed space.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.302
I would've given you
all the time you needed.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.738
You didn't have to ignore me.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.218
And that's why I'm here.

16:42.262 --> 16:46.135
Time and distance
has made me realize

16:46.179 --> 16:48.094
what we had was real.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.230
Yes...

16:56.972 --> 16:59.235
I thought so, too.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.890
Why not pick up
where we left off?

17:01.933 --> 17:05.241
[laughs softly]Let's make up for lost time.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.645
PARKER:
I've got those Petrovic clips
that you requested.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.951
MATTY:
Good, let's start
with Vlado Nanic.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.047
Body turned away at 30 degrees.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.658
Pulled off his feet.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.051
Submissive.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.923
Weak. Loyal.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.751
He'll never flip.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.058
Show me Esma Jelic.

17:40.929 --> 17:44.063
Head bowed slightly.
Shoulders hunched.

17:45.151 --> 17:48.067
She knows the handshake
is coming...

17:48.110 --> 17:51.157
but she's still caught
off guard by it. She fears him.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.159
She'll never tell us
what we need to know.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.075
Show me Adem Divjak.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.036
Eyes locked.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.646
Fully confident.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.694
Self-assured.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.131
Defiant.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.046
And willing to show it
to Petrovic's face.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.657
Which means there's no loyalty,

18:13.701 --> 18:16.138
no trust, and no way
he won't flip on him.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.314
That's our guy.
He'll get us to the broker.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.011
Call the tac team to his house.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.143
On it.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.450
OLIVER:
What is all this?

18:23.493 --> 18:24.494
MacGYVER:
We have some questions about

18:24.538 --> 18:25.843
your financial activities today.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.889
Yeah, your trust fund's
been busy.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.371
How did you find out?

18:31.414 --> 18:33.155
You didn't tell her, did you?

18:33.199 --> 18:34.852
MacGYVER:
Was it you

18:34.896 --> 18:36.158
and your mother?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
Pardon?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.293
DESI:
Your mother used the wedding
to finalize a deal for the land,

18:40.336 --> 18:41.990
and then tried to get rid of the
collateral damage, the princess.

18:42.033 --> 18:46.037
This is absurd. Just because
I bought a gift for Rani

18:46.081 --> 18:49.215
doesn't mean my mum hired
those people to kidnap her.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.826
DESI:
The land was a gift?

18:51.869 --> 18:54.176
For her dream elephant
sanctuary, yes.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.569
She told me you people

18:55.612 --> 18:56.744
were supposed to be
good at your jobs.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.098
SUMITA:
Do you think
he's telling the truth?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.753
Of course.I was asking them.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.537
MacGYVER:
Well, this is why

19:07.581 --> 19:09.757
we wanted Rani here-- I mean,
she knows Oliver best.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.890
But do you truly
know his family?

19:12.934 --> 19:15.110
I would strongly suggest

19:15.154 --> 19:17.156
we postpone the wedding
till MacGyver and Desi

19:17.199 --> 19:18.896
look deeper
into Bella Hughes.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.202
Postponing now
would cause a scandal.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.161
I took a vow
on your mother's deathbed

19:22.204 --> 19:24.337
to keep you safe,
and I will honor that vow

19:24.380 --> 19:25.816
as long as I live.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.470
Then I think Desi

19:27.514 --> 19:28.776
should be
my official security

19:28.819 --> 19:30.343
for the weekend.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.693
Yes. It would be my honor.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.043
[knocking on door]

19:35.086 --> 19:37.306
Oh. Mac.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.699
How did you get on with Oliver?

19:38.742 --> 19:41.354
Yeah, he's clear,
but maybe not his mum.

19:41.397 --> 19:42.529
Riley's doing some digging.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.008
I see you and Sofia

19:44.052 --> 19:46.010
worked things out.Not sure we've got

19:46.054 --> 19:48.709
any staying power,
but, uh, we'll see.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.885
Is that what you want?

19:50.928 --> 19:53.801
Do you think
she's the one, or...?

19:55.281 --> 19:56.760
[laughs]
Well...

19:56.804 --> 19:58.414
I don't really believe
in the one,

19:58.458 --> 20:00.982
but if I did,
I suppose, yes, uh,

20:01.025 --> 20:03.027
yeah, Sofia's, uh, well,
she's pretty damn close.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.507
I mean...

20:05.508 --> 20:06.466
Something you...

20:06.509 --> 20:08.511
on your mind, Mac?

20:08.555 --> 20:10.252
Look, normally I talk to Bozer
about this kind of stuff,

20:10.296 --> 20:12.559
but he's got his hands full
with the mission

20:12.602 --> 20:14.169
and, uh, I don't want
to distract him.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.606
And you're here. Look...

20:16.650 --> 20:19.653
Desi dropped a bomb
on me earlier.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.655
[sighs]

20:21.698 --> 20:24.397
First she tells me
that she was engaged before.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.529
And then she tells me

20:26.573 --> 20:27.922
that he's dead.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.665
Ooh.Yeah, so we've been dancing
around that all day,

20:31.708 --> 20:34.363
acting like
it's business as usual.

20:34.407 --> 20:38.672
So why not just
talk to her about it?

20:38.715 --> 20:40.500
That's the thing, Desi doesn't
want to talk about it.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.024
You know, it's like she-she
drops these little bread crumbs

20:43.067 --> 20:47.071
for me to find or-or wait around
for the next one.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.899
[sighs]
Point I'm trying to make

20:48.943 --> 20:51.162
is that she should've told me
this, like, a long time ago.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.687
Says the chap who kept his plan
to infiltrate Codex a secret

20:53.730 --> 20:56.777
from his boss, his best friend
and his girlfriend.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.303
Look, give Desi all the space
that she needs.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.087
If you keep
pushing,

21:03.131 --> 21:04.959
you could just push her
away for good.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.399
[Indian music playing]

21:10.443 --> 21:12.836
DESI:
I actually thought you would've
picked an elephant.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.664
RANI:
[laughs] Well,

21:14.708 --> 21:17.450
when my mother was alive, we had
peacocks roaming in the garden.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.930
After her death, my father
couldn't bear the sight of them,

21:19.974 --> 21:25.109
so... it's like having
a little piece of her with me.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.198
I'm sure she's watching
over you today,

21:27.242 --> 21:28.939
proud.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.160
Spoken like someone
who's lost a loved one.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.249
Have you lost
a parent, too?

21:38.384 --> 21:40.342
My fiancÃ©.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.344
A few years back.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.826
I can't imagine being
on the precipice of the rest

21:45.869 --> 21:48.089
of your life,
only to have it ripped away.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.004
It was pretty tragic.

21:51.222 --> 21:54.225
And, honestly, I thought
I was over it, but...

21:54.269 --> 21:56.619
being here today,
I know it's the only thing

21:56.663 --> 22:00.014
that's been holding me back
from going all in.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.276
With MacGyver?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.017
[both laugh]

22:03.060 --> 22:05.149
How'd you know?The way he looks at you

22:05.193 --> 22:07.587
With complete adoration
and love.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.980
That's the way Oliver
looks at you.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.463
Why did you invite
Oliver's ex

22:14.507 --> 22:16.160
to your wedding
in the first place?

22:16.204 --> 22:17.379
Elise and Oliver's parents
are close.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.380
It was non-negotiable.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.164
Even though she's psychotic

22:20.208 --> 22:21.731
and tried to kill me.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.080
What?

22:23.124 --> 22:24.430
We were all
at Oxford together.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.040
A bunch of us girls
went shopping.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.650
One minute we're all laughing,
the next I'm tumbling

22:27.694 --> 22:30.000
headfirst down an escalator.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.480
Someone pushed me,

22:31.524 --> 22:32.916
and she was the only one
standing close enough.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.484
And, you know, she denies it
to this day.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.399
DESI:
You were that much
of a threat to her?

22:37.443 --> 22:38.879
I don't understand.

22:38.922 --> 22:42.361
Elise and Oliver were engaged.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.450
I met him months after
they broke it off.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.974
TAYLOR:
Mac, Desi, get to the
interrogation room now.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.455
Um, excuse me.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.157
TAYLOR:
It's too late, Mac.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.854
I tried.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.074
SUMITA:
We found him collapsed
in the chair.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.469
Based on the bruising
around his neck,

23:03.512 --> 23:05.296
my guess is strangulation.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.342
There's no visible sign
of a struggle.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.039
Clearly, someone had access
to the room.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.693
Yes, looks like an inside job.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.173
Whoever did this was behind
the kidnapping attempt

23:12.216 --> 23:13.914
and wanted to cover
their tracks.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.220
If they had access
and opportunity,

23:16.264 --> 23:17.483
why wouldn't they release
the prisoner

23:17.526 --> 23:18.658
and help him escape?

23:18.701 --> 23:20.181
To send us a signal.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.836
They know we're onto them.
And this is a warning.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.497
OLIVER:
Maybe we should cancel
the wedding.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.890
If we cancel the wedding now,
we may never find the killer

23:33.934 --> 23:35.196
or who they're after.

23:35.239 --> 23:36.327
I can't spend the rest
of my life

23:36.371 --> 23:37.720
looking over my shoulder.

23:37.764 --> 23:40.201
And what about your dad?
He's at risk, too.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.333
This is no longer your decision.
I must alert the king.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.987
Absolutely not.
I forbid it.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.294
My first and only duty
is to keep you safe

23:46.337 --> 23:48.165
and ensure that you
ascend the throne one day.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.951
That day is not today.

23:52.866 --> 23:57.087
Mac, what's that there?

23:58.611 --> 24:00.482
It's henna, meaning
whoever strangled him

24:00.526 --> 24:02.832
had fresh ink on their hands.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.355
Elise?

24:04.399 --> 24:06.706
She did eventually
show up.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.882
RILEY:
Yeah, but so did
hundreds of others.

24:08.925 --> 24:11.058
What about Nitesh?DESI: Only the women got henna.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.147
That cuts the suspect
list in half.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.454
Or the henna smear could
be planted by a male

24:15.497 --> 24:17.412
to throw us
off the scent.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.283
We need to keep this
investigation under wraps.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.502
Agreed.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.722
We don't want to spook him,
or her.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.333
But how do we know
when everyone got henna

24:25.376 --> 24:27.727
if we can't
interrogate anyone?

24:27.770 --> 24:29.163
RANI:
Instagram.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.251
Everyone's posting
their henna tattoos

24:30.294 --> 24:31.774
on social media

24:31.818 --> 24:34.255
using the "RaOliver's
Rockin' Wedding" hashtag.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.041
Rani's right.
But that's still 250 suspects.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.436
We can use an oxidation test.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.353
Henna, it, uh, it darkens
over time.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.529
Then we can cross-reference
the shade with the Instagram

24:47.573 --> 24:49.792
photos from the Mehndi
and find out who the killer is.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.533
MacGYVER:
Oxidation tests should be
conducted

24:51.577 --> 24:53.753
in temperature-controlled
environments.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.364
Unfortunately,
I'm a few continents away

24:56.407 --> 24:58.018
from my lab of choice.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.499
But if I set up an oxidation box with this minibar,

25:00.542 --> 25:02.936
and use the lemon's ascorbic
and citric acid

25:02.979 --> 25:05.068
to assist
in the developing process,

25:05.112 --> 25:07.810
just add heat,
and we'll be one step closer

25:07.854 --> 25:10.813
to identifying the killer.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.641
In the meantime,
we need to continue on

25:12.685 --> 25:14.643
with the festivities
as planned, okay?

25:14.687 --> 25:16.384
Buy time for Mac.I'll talk to Sumita
and make sure

25:16.427 --> 25:17.820
she doesn't cancel any events.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.996
I'll have to loop in
my parents on this.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.607
MacGYVER:
Tell them to keep
appearances up.

25:21.650 --> 25:25.436
It's important, because
if we spook the killer,

25:25.480 --> 25:27.308
it could cost you your lives.

25:29.876 --> 25:32.226

female wedding guest

25:32.269 --> 25:34.141

to compile 250 dossiers?

25:37.884 --> 25:40.408
Depends if Riley Davis
or Artemis37 is getting them.

You've known me five years

25:51.854 --> 25:53.029

the benefit of the doubt?

have been if Mac and Jack

26:05.389 --> 26:07.609
didn't bring me
into the Phoenix?

26:07.653 --> 26:11.004
I just want to give these girls
the same thing I was given.

26:11.047 --> 26:13.572
An outlet for their skills.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.530
That's dope.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.227
So how can I help?

26:17.271 --> 26:19.316
By letting me do
this one on my own.

what you're on about, big man.

I'm really glad we're here
together at this wedding.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.772

29:34.555 --> 29:36.731
Sorry, Des.
I had no idea.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.385
Why would you?

29:38.428 --> 29:40.039
I never wanted
you to know,

29:40.082 --> 29:42.476
I didn't want anyone else
after that to know.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.043
Why?

29:44.086 --> 29:46.697
Because of how
they looked at me.

29:46.741 --> 29:50.223
First it was sorrow,
then it was pity.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.051
And nobody could separate me

29:52.094 --> 29:54.880
from the terrible thing
that had happened to me.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.578
That's why you left the service.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.406
Yeah.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.365
I didn't date for a really
long time after that.

30:04.019 --> 30:07.718
Then I met you and we
clicked. [chuckles]

30:12.201 --> 30:15.726
I never really questioned
why until now.

30:17.380 --> 30:21.297
And if I'm being really
honest with myself...

30:21.341 --> 30:23.647
well, you're
a lot like him.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.867
What do you mean?

30:25.911 --> 30:27.738
Just like Evan, you
and I work together.

30:27.782 --> 30:30.567
We both thrive on that
same adrenaline rush

30:30.611 --> 30:32.308
when we're on an op.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.136
It's the same dynamic
he and I had.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.531
So we both love our job.

30:37.574 --> 30:40.142
I'm just worried that...

30:42.144 --> 30:44.886
...maybe you're some sort of
emotional stand-in for him

30:44.930 --> 30:49.238
and that instead of
getting over his death,

30:49.282 --> 30:51.501
I kind of just
replaced him with you.

30:51.545 --> 30:54.287
I, uh...
I don't even really know

30:54.330 --> 30:55.766
what to say to that.

30:55.810 --> 30:57.246
I just want to make sure
I'm not repeating

30:57.290 --> 30:58.639
some old pattern.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.033
First I'm a replacement,
now I'm a pattern...

31:01.076 --> 31:03.122
I'm really trying hard
to work through this.

31:03.165 --> 31:06.125
And I'm sorry, but I don't
have all the answers, okay?

31:06.168 --> 31:07.778
Yeah, sorry, Des.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.563
Uh, as hard as this is
for me to hear,

31:09.606 --> 31:11.695
it's got to be a thousand times
harder for you.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.002
I just-- I guess I just
want to know what...

31:14.046 --> 31:16.309
what does this mean for us?

31:19.965 --> 31:21.662
Um...

31:21.705 --> 31:23.707
you told me to take
all the time I need

31:23.751 --> 31:26.362
to figure out
what I'm feeling,

31:26.406 --> 31:28.669
and obviously, right now
I'm feeling a lot.

31:31.063 --> 31:35.589
The last thing I want to do
is run away from you.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.463
Okay, then.

31:40.507 --> 31:43.118
Then let's work through it
together, one step at a time.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.211
[knocking on door]

31:50.473 --> 31:52.345
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

31:52.388 --> 31:53.868
Have you?

31:55.391 --> 31:58.264
Why, Dougal, have you
fallen off the wagon?

32:01.441 --> 32:03.269
I wanted to come sooner,
but I had to wait

32:03.312 --> 32:05.662
for Rudy to pass out.Why? So you can steal

32:05.706 --> 32:07.708
more information about

32:07.751 --> 32:11.059
Atahualpa's treasure? Hmm?

32:11.103 --> 32:12.843
It's not what you think.Really?

32:12.887 --> 32:16.325
See, I think the reason
that you left me in L.A.

32:16.369 --> 32:19.328
was that you got all the
information that you needed

32:19.372 --> 32:21.026
for your little treasure hunt,

32:21.069 --> 32:24.333
and you managed to
get yourself a count

32:24.377 --> 32:26.814
to help finance your
expedition to find it.

32:26.857 --> 32:30.383
Well done. It's all just
crystal clear now.

32:33.342 --> 32:36.041
I just never pegged you for
someone that would steal

32:36.084 --> 32:39.218
from a friend to
further your career.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.915
I'm doing it for my family.Oh, please.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.527
Your family's got more money
than the Catholic Church.

32:44.571 --> 32:47.008
Everyone except my father,
who drank up all our money

32:47.052 --> 32:48.227
by the time I was ten.

32:48.270 --> 32:49.924
It was the pity of my uncle

32:49.968 --> 32:52.013
that afforded me
an Oxford education,

32:52.057 --> 32:55.060
and a living stipend so we could
keep up appearances,

32:55.103 --> 32:56.975
keep our family name
out of the gossip rags.

33:00.587 --> 33:01.980
I guess we're more alike
than you thought.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.720
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

33:03.764 --> 33:05.374
Especially as you know
that money means nothing to me.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.942
Says the man who has more coins
than he can count.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.553
This treasure

33:10.597 --> 33:12.294
is the windfall that I need.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.340
That my family needs.
Surely you can understand that.

33:14.383 --> 33:15.863
So just because I grew up
with no money,

33:15.906 --> 33:17.082
you want me to forgive you?

33:17.125 --> 33:19.214
Is that it?
Because your uncle

33:19.258 --> 33:21.434
paid you just
a tiny little stipend?

33:23.131 --> 33:25.786
It doesn't make it any better.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.048
Does it?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.224
And I'm appalled
that it's taken you

33:29.268 --> 33:32.314
so long for you to
tell me the truth.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.057
I'm sorry, Russ.I'm not!

33:37.928 --> 33:39.278
I think this little
tryst of ours

33:39.321 --> 33:42.368
has... has reached
its expiration date.

33:42.411 --> 33:44.500
Don't you?

33:57.165 --> 33:59.646
MacGYVER:
Guys, the test is done.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.736
I got a color match.

34:02.779 --> 34:05.347
Each sample took three hours,
20 minutes to get to this shade,

34:05.391 --> 34:08.829
meaning henna was applied
between 1:45 and 1:50 p.m.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.571
Pulling up time-stamped
photos now.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.185
There's got to be something...

34:17.229 --> 34:18.621
Wait a second.

34:18.665 --> 34:21.407
This one, 1:48.

34:23.235 --> 34:26.107
Sumita.
It's not possible, is it?

34:26.151 --> 34:28.109
BOZER:
But why would someone
who's taken care of Rani

34:28.153 --> 34:29.415
since she was a child
want to hurt her?

34:29.458 --> 34:30.546
I don't know, but, uh, Desi,

34:30.590 --> 34:31.939
hold on tight to Rani.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.245
Do not let Sumita
anywhere near her.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.029
She's the killer.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.602
â™ª

34:58.879 --> 35:00.272
[muffled scream]

35:01.273 --> 35:02.926
Taylor, I've got Sumita.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.929
Copy that. I'll stay close
to Oliver and the PM.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.757
You orchestrated
Rani's kidnapping

35:07.801 --> 35:09.324
and you killed the
kidnapper that you hired.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.544
You did a really good job,
I'll admit, but you left

35:11.587 --> 35:13.676
a mark on your victim.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.939
Wait a second, your
fingertips-- discolored.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.811
Faded henna.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.378
That only happens
with a chemical interaction.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.423
[sniffs]

35:21.467 --> 35:23.251
Ammonia nitrate.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.428
Where is it?
The bomb. Where is it?

35:28.735 --> 35:30.345
Where is the bomb?

35:30.389 --> 35:32.565
Waiting patiently somewhere.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.611
We, uh, we only have
a couple of minutes.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.613
Taylor, you disperse the crowd.
I'll find the bomb.

35:37.657 --> 35:40.138
Right.
Right, everyone, everyone,

35:40.181 --> 35:41.530
just stay, just stop!

35:46.405 --> 35:48.885
Desi, get Rani
to a safe room now.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.497
Assuming there is a safe room.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.759
[Rani gasps]

35:56.893 --> 35:59.766
[grunting]

36:05.685 --> 36:07.643
MacGYVER:
You learn a lot
by being a bomb tech,

36:07.687 --> 36:09.515
but I actually learned how to hunt for ammonia nitrate

36:09.558 --> 36:12.996
when Bozer and I got a fish tank
in the seventh grade.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.695
Nitrate is a byproduct
of fish waste,

36:15.738 --> 36:16.826
and in high levels,
it can be a common

36:16.870 --> 36:19.133
cause of death in aquariums.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.874
I know, I know.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.745
Hunting for rotten fish poop
is a lot different

36:22.789 --> 36:24.356
than hunting for a bomb.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.706
But being an EOD
helped me recognize

36:26.749 --> 36:29.752
where someone would place
a bomb for maximum damage.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.711
If everyone could just stop!
They're not paying

36:31.754 --> 36:32.755
any attention to me.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.017
They're not listening to me.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.455
And the-the drum
sounds like it's...

36:36.498 --> 36:38.587
it's making my ears bleed,
it's so out of tune.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.198
You'd think they'd tune it...

36:42.156 --> 36:43.375
The bomb's in the drum.

36:43.418 --> 36:44.637
The bomb's in the drum!

36:47.988 --> 36:49.685
Oh. Mac, got it.

36:49.729 --> 36:51.252
[device beeping]

36:51.296 --> 36:52.558
It's in there.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.387
[man shouts]

37:00.087 --> 37:01.697
TAYLOR:
Where were you told to stand?

37:01.741 --> 37:03.264
MAN:
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:03.308 --> 37:04.700
This is a quarter pound
of explosives.

37:04.744 --> 37:06.876
It wasn't meant
to go past the altar.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.443
She was only trying
to take out the royal family.

37:08.487 --> 37:11.141
All right, well,
you better do your thing.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.100
I-I can't.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.276
Well, if you can't defuse it,
what's your plan?

37:17.409 --> 37:19.324
I'm gonna let it go off.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.455
What?

37:24.285 --> 37:26.026
MacGYVER:
Bombs are doubly lethal.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.289
They throw shrapnel
and produce pressure waves.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.423
But by containing the blast,
I can prevent both.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.558
[people screaming]

37:38.081 --> 37:39.692
[excited chatter]

37:39.735 --> 37:41.781
Too, uh, early for fireworks?

37:47.395 --> 37:49.049
SUMITA:
I never intended

37:49.092 --> 37:50.920
to hurt you.You tried to kill me

37:50.964 --> 37:52.922
and my family.Kidnapping you

37:52.966 --> 37:56.317
would have given me enough time
to change your mind,

37:56.361 --> 37:58.667
but then I realized
you would never learn.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.321
You had your heart set

38:00.365 --> 38:03.890
on throwing away
300 years of tradition.

38:03.933 --> 38:07.328
I'm glad your mother's not alive
to see your betrayal.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.983
You would murder me
because I'm giving my city

38:10.026 --> 38:11.637
the economic prosperity
it deserves?

38:11.680 --> 38:13.116
Naive child.

38:14.117 --> 38:17.425
You know nothing
of foreign greed.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.389
You asked me if I truly knew
the family I'm marrying into,

38:24.432 --> 38:27.479
but I never knew
my own guardian.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.700
I leave her with you, Nitesh.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.063
Thank you. For everything.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.936
I could...

38:49.979 --> 38:51.981
I could never repay you.

38:53.461 --> 38:56.377
Actually,
we may have found a way.

38:56.421 --> 38:57.857
TAYLOR:
It may be difficult,

38:57.900 --> 38:59.946
considering the circumstances,
but, uh...

38:59.989 --> 39:02.122
Go out there
and have the wedding

39:02.165 --> 39:04.254
you've been dreaming of.

39:04.298 --> 39:05.473
Okay?

39:08.955 --> 39:10.260
[laughs softly]

39:10.304 --> 39:11.740
[cheering, applause]

39:11.784 --> 39:13.263
[dance music playing]

39:13.307 --> 39:15.483
â™ª

39:24.753 --> 39:27.365
Look, I know this weekend has...

39:29.323 --> 39:31.281
...dredged up a lot for you.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.719
Thinking about my ex

39:33.762 --> 39:37.157
and what happened, just...

39:37.200 --> 39:39.681
it made me feel
really guilty about us.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.338
That's a lot to carry around.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.776
I need to let him go.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.691
So that I can move forward...

39:52.128 --> 39:53.303
...with you.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.655
I like the sound of that.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.053
So I've been
thinking a lot,

40:04.097 --> 40:06.316
uh, about what you said
last night,

40:06.360 --> 40:08.928
about me being an emotional
stand-in for your ex.

40:08.971 --> 40:11.104
Well, maybe you are
and maybe you aren't.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.714
Who knows?

40:12.758 --> 40:15.151
I'd like to know.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.764
And the only way to do that
is to live a normal life.

40:18.807 --> 40:19.895
Yeah, our lives
are anything but normal.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.897
When we're
on a mission, yes.

40:21.941 --> 40:25.423
But... it's the other stuff.

40:25.466 --> 40:28.251
Like making dinner,
brushing our teeth,

40:28.295 --> 40:30.253
watching TV.

40:30.297 --> 40:33.169
Those are moments that add up
to little bits and pieces

40:33.213 --> 40:34.910
of a life that I see
sharing with you.

40:34.954 --> 40:37.913
Mac, we talked about this.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.480
That's not where I'm going.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.308
Trust me, I got
the message loud and clear.

40:41.351 --> 40:44.485
But I am talking about
the next logical step

40:44.529 --> 40:46.095
in our relationship.

40:47.923 --> 40:49.490
Which is?

40:49.534 --> 40:53.276
You moving in with me?

40:58.194 --> 41:00.240
â™ª

41:00.283 --> 41:01.937
SOFIA:
I take it

41:01.981 --> 41:04.244
since Rani and Oliver
were married without incident,

41:04.287 --> 41:06.333
your mission was a success?

41:06.376 --> 41:08.335
What do you want, Sofia? Hmm?

41:09.292 --> 41:10.772
To tell you the truth.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.731
I've been living a lie

41:12.774 --> 41:15.342
my entire life,

41:15.385 --> 41:17.649
and that treasure,
your treasure,

41:17.692 --> 41:19.825
the one that you and your
grandfather dreamt about,

41:19.868 --> 41:21.174
isn't some far-off fairy tale.

41:21.217 --> 41:23.481
Yes, I know.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.527
I've been researching it
since I was 16 years old.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.529
Looking in all
the wrong places.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.749
That's why Rudolf
is my plus-one.

41:30.792 --> 41:31.924
The Von Stupensens

41:31.967 --> 41:34.883
had ties with the Nazis.

41:36.145 --> 41:37.886
And during World War II,
it was rumored

41:37.930 --> 41:42.195
that the Nazis found
Atahualpa's treasure. Hmm.

41:44.632 --> 41:48.897
So, you're working poor old Rudy
and his family connections

41:48.941 --> 41:50.812
for intel about the treasure,
are you?

41:53.902 --> 41:55.338
Yes.

41:56.339 --> 41:57.950
And once I get
more intel,

41:57.993 --> 42:00.648
I think you and I should go
and find it together.

42:08.003 --> 42:09.744
[vocalizing]

42:09.788 --> 42:11.833
MATTY:
I'm guessing,
because you're dancing,

42:11.877 --> 42:13.313
things went well in Bikaner.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.577
Yes, it did.

42:16.621 --> 42:17.752
In a surprise twist of events,

42:17.796 --> 42:18.797
the killer turned out
to be Sumita,

42:18.840 --> 42:21.234
Rani's trusted advisor.

42:21.277 --> 42:23.845
Well, sometimes the people
closest to us

42:23.889 --> 42:25.455
aren't who they seem to be.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.807
Where's Riley?

42:33.159 --> 42:35.204
â™ª

42:37.076 --> 42:38.773
Sorry I'm late.

42:45.954 --> 42:48.566
Welcome to the Brink.

42:48.609 --> 42:51.220
I'm Artemis37.

42:51.264 --> 42:53.309
Let's get to work.
