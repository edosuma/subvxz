Okay.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.438
[howling continues]

00:31.906 --> 00:34.701
-[man on TV]  Hello?
-[knocking on TV]

00:46.463 --> 00:49.132
[theme music playing]

02:23.935 --> 02:26.229
-Thanks for coming up, Dr. Carr.
-Of course.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.190
I realized I don't know much
about your life in Boston,

02:29.399 --> 02:31.985
outside of your work at the university.
Do you have a husband?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.612
-No.
-Kids, or...?

02:34.988 --> 02:35.989
No. Neither.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.783
I've been following your work,
and I have to say I'm rather impressed.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.368
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

02:40.451 --> 02:44.164
I'm not the only one. There's a growing
interest in your project around here.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.418
So I was wondering, Agents Tench
and Ford can't run this all by themselves,

02:48.501 --> 02:52.213
if you would be interested in managing
the project and keeping things on track

02:52.297 --> 02:54.507
in a more permanent position
here at Quantico.

02:54.591 --> 02:58.011
-No. I can't.
-You don't have to answer now.

02:58.094 --> 03:01.598
It's very flattering,
but I already have a job in Boston.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.100
Dr. Carr, your knowledge
and professionalism

03:04.183 --> 03:05.560
have already had a great impact

03:05.643 --> 03:07.937
on our understanding
of behavioral science.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.774
It would be a shame
not to take full advantage of that.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.484
Take your time.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.614
Sleep on it.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.998
I'd rather you didn't tell Tench or Ford
about this until you make your decision.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.583
-They don't know?
-No.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.548
I have two questions for you, Benjamin.
First one...

03:36.591 --> 03:38.468
-That thing on?
-Yes.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.512
What the fuck were you crying about
last time we saw you?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.723
And secondly, and this one
is a big question,

03:43.806 --> 03:45.600
so I want you to listen very carefully.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.393
Are you listening to me? Benji?

03:48.686 --> 03:51.940
Why? Why would you do that
to Beverly Jean?

03:54.108 --> 03:56.361
Fractured jaw. Two black eyes.

03:56.861 --> 03:57.737
Why?

03:58.321 --> 04:01.616
Fourteen stab wounds in the torso
with a kitchen knife.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.160
Blow to the head, blunt force trauma.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.371
Her breasts were amputated.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.665
I need to know this.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.043
Why would you do that
to your girlfriend, man?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.002
I didn't.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.837
So you're telling us it was Frank.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.973
He called us. He was freaked out.
I went over.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.309
-And then?
-I walked into the living room

04:28.393 --> 04:30.937
and Beverly Jean was knocked out
on the floor, tied up.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.480
Did he tell you what happened?

04:32.563 --> 04:34.399
[Frank] Benji was a total mess.

04:34.482 --> 04:38.152
Think he tried to get into her panties,
she wouldn't let him, he knocked her out.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.655
-That's why he called you?
-He calls me when he's in trouble.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.324
-[Holden] She was alive at this point?
-Yes.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.743
-So why'd you kill her?
-Don't answer that.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.500
I didn't.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.755
Why would a man, any man,
do that to a woman's breasts?

04:57.839 --> 05:01.968
And who would take a hunting knife
to a woman's reproductive organs?

05:02.051 --> 05:03.177
All right.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.138
"All right"?
There's nothing right about it.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.390
That's enough.
Now my client's also a victim here.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.101
A victim?
Interesting, thank you, I'll take that.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.353
Let's do an easy one.
Why did you do that to her hair?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.273
-[man] You don't have to answer that.
-[Holden] So you did cut her hair?

05:15.356 --> 05:17.775
Frank seems to think Beverly Jean
got to a point

05:17.859 --> 05:20.528
where she was interested
in seeing other guys.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.240
-She'd just had her hair done, right?
-Let me ask you one more thing.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.827
How does stabbing somebody
in the asshole make you feel better?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.078
Enough. This is speculation.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.205
You still have the death penalty
in Pennsylvania?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.665
Don't threaten my client.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.585
[Holden] Tell us you're not a monster.
Give us one reason to believe.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.961
She fucked Frank.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.838
[Tench] He told you this?

05:38.921 --> 05:40.256
-[Benjamin] I saw.
-[Tench] What?

05:41.966 --> 05:46.054
I saw her on the living room floor
with Frank on top of her.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.180
So what did you do?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.682
-[Benjamin] Nothing.
-You didn't do anything?

05:49.766 --> 05:51.225
-[Benjamin] No.
-You didn't hit him?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.895
-No.
-You hit her.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.564
[Tench] Why would Beverly Jean
want sex with Frank?

05:57.356 --> 05:59.859
He's always saying he liked her hair.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.154
Every time he saw her.

06:04.822 --> 06:09.243
Thing is, he didn't care about her hair
at all. He just used it to rile me.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.246
She was too stupid to notice.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.792
-So you killed her?
-[Benjamin] I didn't kill her.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.753
She was already dead when I stabbed her.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.256
She was already dead.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.135
-[Tench] You raped her in front of him?
-He told you that?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.887
Why fuck your brother-in-law's girlfriend?

06:27.970 --> 06:30.973
-Maybe show him how to do it?
-Maybe to mess with him?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.809
Fuck you.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.270
I hope they fry your ass
in the fucking chair.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.855
Don't try to intimidate my client.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.155
If Benjamin killed her,
you should just tell us.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.575
I didn't see Benji kill her.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.038
[recorder clicks]

07:01.337 --> 07:04.382
I hate that fuck Frank,
but it's always the boyfriend.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.926
When you're lost, you play the odds.
It's Benjamin.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.094
I'm not so sure.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.347
You should have seen Frank
after you walked out of the room.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.142
He looked at me and said,
"I did not see Benjamin kill her."

07:14.225 --> 07:16.060
-They're messing with us.
-I believed him.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.313
-I am sick and tired of this shithole.
-I know.

to invite you to dinner.

all this time with. Have a look at you.

on the wall,

14:33.330 --> 14:36.041
-Your father really didn't speak to you?
-No.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.377
But you speak with Brian.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.424
You want one more?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.593
-[distant gunfire]
-[Bill]  Uh-huh.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.512
-You walk him through the crime scene?
-[Ocasek]  Yeah.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.265
Okay. Has he seen all our notes
on the evidence?

14:51.348 --> 14:53.475
-Yeah, I showed him everything.
-[Tench] And?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.269
He is going to try Benjamin first.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.062
Wait a minute. Say that again.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.273
He's only gonna try Benjamin,
not all three.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.275
-[Tench] Mark, that's not right.
-Is that Ocasek?

15:01.358 --> 15:03.277
He's confident
after he convicts Benjamin--

15:03.360 --> 15:05.654
Obviously, there's something
he doesn't understand.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.781
Well, I tried to explain
exactly like you said,

15:07.865 --> 15:09.366
but he wasn't interested in talking.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.368
-Okay, look, I'll call you back.
-I'm sorry.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.745
Shit, it's not your fault, Mark.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.122
Let me talk to some folks here
and get back to you.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.999
-Okay.
-What's happening?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.834
The DA is going after Benjamin first,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.086
which means
he'll end up offering a plea deal

15:21.170 --> 15:22.630
for Frank's and Rose's testimony.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.257
Did Ocasek tell him
about Frank's history of violence?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.717
[Tench] I'm sure he did.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.802
Clearly, he's the most dangerous
of the three.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.764
[Tench] We need to go talk to the DA,
help him understand.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.307
I have a deposition this afternoon.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.351
-I can't do anything till tomorrow.
-I'll go.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.520
You better go with him.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.155
[Carr]  It is acutely obvious
that, in this instance,

15:48.238 --> 15:50.991
the anger was triggered by stressors

15:51.075 --> 15:53.577
that were focused on his fiancé
in particular.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.662
"Stressors"?

15:54.745 --> 15:57.456
Dramatic life events.
Things that pushed both their buttons.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.167
Frank Janderman was happily married
with a new baby on the way.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.087
[Carr] But Frank didn't want
to be a father. He hated that.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.382
-Is that a motive?
-No. It's what we call a stressor.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.592
So you think Frank did it?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.886
[Carr] Benjamin wouldn't have been able to
on his own.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.888
You're saying Benjamin was provoked
by Frank?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.515
Pushed. Yes.

16:14.598 --> 16:17.726
Frank saw his chance
and raped Beverly Jean.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.020
-Situationally motivated sexual assaults--
-Wait.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.648
-"Situationally"?
-As opposed to preferential, yes.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.401
Well, look it. Here's my question.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.528
Who killed her?

16:27.611 --> 16:29.613
All three of them are responsible
for her death.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.241
-So they all mutilated the body?
-[Carr] No, that was Benjamin.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.369
Frank and Benjamin left her body
at the dump, wrapped up.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.497
But Benjamin came back a few days later.
He couldn't let go.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.208
Remember, he was under a lot of stress.
He took the knife to her--

16:41.291 --> 16:44.837
Let me stop you there, because...
here's the problem.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.130
How do I prove all this?

16:46.213 --> 16:49.550
I'm just here to provide you
with intelligent, accurate analysis.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.928
If a jury can't understand your analysis,
then it's no use to anybody, is it?

16:53.012 --> 16:56.306
I agree. But it isn't my job
to make the jury understand anything.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.307
That's your job.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.685
And we have all placed our trust in you.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.526
[Carr] How do we translate this
so you can use it?

17:07.609 --> 17:11.113
What you're saying is that both Benjamin
and Frank killed her, right?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.573
[Carr] It's complicated, I know.

17:12.656 --> 17:16.285
Benjamin knocked her out
because he felt like he was rejected,

17:16.368 --> 17:17.661
which is a stressor.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.913
He tied her up
and called his brother-in-law Frank

17:19.997 --> 17:21.331
because he didn't know what to do.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.002
So Frank comes over and takes advantage
of the situation and rapes her.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.006
Benjamin doesn't stop him
because he wants to see her humiliated.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.133
Now Frank knows that he's in trouble,

17:31.216 --> 17:33.927
so he starts telling Benjamin
what a slut she is.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.472
And that is a big problem for Benjamin.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.015
So they kill her.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.809
Then they call Rose,
have her come and help clean up.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.772
And she sees the poor girl in the bathtub
and realizes that she's still alive.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.648
So they stab her again.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.193
And then they move the body to the dump.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.655
Okay.

17:55.657 --> 17:56.784
Okay.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.536
-That went well.
-You think?

18:01.580 --> 18:04.792
Sure, I mean...
what don't you think he grasped?

18:05.709 --> 18:08.337
Well, I mean, Holden,
you know these people. I don't.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.215
I think that he seemed very intent
on blaming Benjamin,

18:11.298 --> 18:13.342
and I'm not quite sure
I got him over that.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.221
Well, certainly at the end,
he seemed very attentive.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.808
I thought you laid it out clearly
and concisely for him

18:20.891 --> 18:22.101
that it was all three.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.019
Well, if you're right,
then we should be fine.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.521
Yes, we should be.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.737
-How's commuting?
-What do you mean?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.614
Having half of your life in Boston.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.783
What?

18:39.701 --> 18:41.286
Is the back and forth a strain?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.997
I know that it was discombobulating
for me, all the travel,

18:44.081 --> 18:46.166
when we were straddling Road School.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.130
Is small talk a way
you deal with your anxiety?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.342
-I suppose.
-Hm.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.138
Okay.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.725
[Fleetwood Mac's "Albatross" playing]

19:47.102 --> 19:48.770
[bell tolling]

20:06.121 --> 20:07.456
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.666
Thought you were back tomorrow.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.835
-Was. Plans changed.
-Oh.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.212
We talked about that.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.298
Sorry, but I'm so glad you're home early.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.758
[exhales softly]

20:19.343 --> 20:20.385
Hi.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.767
You look tired.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.021
I mean, you look great,
but also a little tired.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.024
Thanks. I, uh... I'm okay.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.444
If you want to go home, freshen up,
I've got some things to finish here.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.030
Oh, yeah. Okay.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.576
You know, I actually wanted
to talk something over with you.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.453
It'd be great if we could do that tonight.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.080
-What is it?
-Oh.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.957
You know, it's fine. It can wait.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.126
No. No, come on.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.254
I don't think he tried to understand.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.215
He just wanted some buzzwords
that he could parrot.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.551
Intellectually, these people
have reached their limits.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.971
They will never understand the discourse
on any deeper level,

21:04.054 --> 21:06.556
nor will they ever become conversant
in your vernacular.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.642
I actually think they're quite intuitive.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.186
I'm not talking about my colleagues.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.437
Your colleagues?

21:12.938 --> 21:15.691
-Are you an FBI agent?
-[scoffs] Don't be absurd.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.070
But that is what I wanted to discuss.

21:20.654 --> 21:25.409
I'm having a really hard time juggling
my research and everything back here.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.785
I warned you this would happen.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.748
Well, I'm torn. And I'm not really
delivering either place.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.543
And I should be spending more time
at Quantico.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.670
I think that's a bad idea.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.760
-But you know best.
-Well, I'm not sure I do or...

21:43.844 --> 21:45.554
It's why I wanted to talk it over.

21:46.763 --> 21:50.684
I don't have to remind you.
Your review is in three months.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.104
If you aren't tenured,
you'll leave the university.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.689
Yeah, you needn't remind me.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.401
It's no secret I find it difficult
watching you waste your time down there.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.610
Waste my time?

22:02.321 --> 22:04.031
Do you think that I'm wasting my time?

22:04.114 --> 22:06.908
-Come on, I don't wanna argue about this.
-Neither do I.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.579
Babe, focus on the thing
that will make your career.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.789
They've offered me a full-time position.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.167
And?

22:17.753 --> 22:19.087
You can't be serious.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.547
Why would you say that?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.426
[stammers] I'm sure it's flattering,
but honestly, you said it yourself,

22:24.509 --> 22:26.970
these people have reached
their intellectual limits.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.472
No, I didn't say that.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.060
Do they know you're lesbian?

22:34.186 --> 22:37.355
-Of course not.
-Exactly. You can't be yourself.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.984
Are you really going to hide
half of your life?

22:41.068 --> 22:43.070
-I do that here.
-What do you mean by that?

22:43.153 --> 22:45.405
I can't tell any of your friends
I work with the FBI

22:45.489 --> 22:48.367
-because it could reflect badly on you.
-Let's not.

22:51.620 --> 22:55.415
I told Will and Gore
I'd meet them for a glass of wine.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.541
Please.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.044
Come with me.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.129
[indistinct chatter]

23:01.213 --> 23:03.423
[man] In society,
everyone behaves in certain ways

23:03.507 --> 23:07.427
in order to avoid embarrassment,
either for ourselves or others.

23:07.511 --> 23:11.807
The very idea of embarrassing oneself,
or others,

23:11.890 --> 23:14.851
by being oneself
speaks to a deeper treachery.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.353
Treachery!

23:16.436 --> 23:18.021
Goffman saw a connection

23:18.105 --> 23:22.734
between the kinds of acts or masks
that people put on in their daily lives

23:22.818 --> 23:25.195
and in theatrical performances.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.031
In a social interaction,
as in a theatrical performance,

23:28.115 --> 23:31.952
there's an onstage area where individuals,
or actors as the case may be,

23:32.035 --> 23:33.954
appear before the audience.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.248
But there must be a backstage,

23:36.331 --> 23:39.835
a hidden, private area,
where individuals can truly be themselves.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.712
Of course, Annaliese, that's lovely,
but you're missing the point.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.673
-Excuse me.
-[man 2] There's no embarrassment

23:44.756 --> 23:47.342
for anyone in their hidden
and private places.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.678
It's not backstage
where the damage is done.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.931
[man] Must we indulge in your melodrama?

24:11.074 --> 24:12.242
What the fuck happened, Mark?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.452
-You guys might be too late.
-Is he in there?

24:14.536 --> 24:16.163
-Yeah.
-Let's go talk to him.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.290
I know you came a long way...

24:18.373 --> 24:20.417
Who doesn't like
a four-hour drive in winter?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.210
-[Ocasek] It's done.
-[Tench] It ain't over

24:22.294 --> 24:23.420
till the fat lady sings.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.718
You offered him a plea bargain?

24:29.801 --> 24:32.012
He just pled guilty
to third-degree murder.

24:32.470 --> 24:35.765
And he is now facing five to 20 years
in a state psychiatric hospital.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.894
-You've misunderstood.
-Look. You did a great job.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.770
And you almost got it right.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.772
But it was never Frank,
it was all Benjamin.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.149
You know that's not true.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.736
You had an expert in psychopathy
and sexual homicide

24:47.819 --> 24:49.946
from Boston University
make a recommendation

24:50.030 --> 24:52.657
that Frank motivated Benjamin
to commit murder and--

24:52.741 --> 24:54.492
She said he pushed his buttons.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.661
[DA] And Benjamin came back
and disfigured the body.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.996
Well, guess what?

24:58.079 --> 24:59.331
Frank confirmed all that.

24:59.414 --> 25:03.543
But Dr. Carr got one thing wrong.
Frank didn't rape her. Benjamin did.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.670
The victim was already dead
when Frank got there.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.006
-Hold on.
-She said Benjamin was jealous,

25:08.089 --> 25:10.050
sexually frustrated, humiliated.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.009
That's a motive.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.969
-You got it all wrong.
-I have the report here.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.722
I've read the report.
It points in the opposite direction.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.558
Benjamin was impotent
because of the stressors.

25:18.642 --> 25:22.020
He was frustrated and humiliated. It was
impossible for him to rape the victim.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.064
I understand the righteousness
of your cause,

25:24.648 --> 25:27.651
but this is an exceptionally difficult
and disturbing case.

25:27.734 --> 25:31.613
There's very little forensic evidence.
Almost all the evidence is circumstantial.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.907
You classify our evidence
as circumstantial?

25:35.116 --> 25:35.992
[sighs]

25:36.201 --> 25:38.703
Frank told us where to find
the victim's breasts.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.997
-Benjamin had kept them.
-[Holden] So?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.583
So, I got a guy who's jealous,
sexually frustrated,

25:43.667 --> 25:46.753
and we find the victim's breasts
buried in his backyard.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.506
Then I got a guy who's willing to tell us
what happened.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.424
There's a huge difference
between killing a woman

25:51.508 --> 25:53.426
and mutilating her body after she is dead.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.888
A plea bargain is the only antidote
against a failed prosecution.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.640
[Tench] You're letting Frank off.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.059
He shouldn't just go
to a mental institution for five years.

26:01.142 --> 26:04.104
-He should be put away for life.
-[DA] Five to 20 years.

26:04.187 --> 26:07.148
And the defense is arguing
the state had a duty of care

26:07.232 --> 26:08.942
the first time Frank was in the hospital.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.152
The onus is on the state
to make him better.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.988
He's never going to get better.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.031
I have to make a phone call.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.513
[Tench]  He's letting the wrong guy off
with a lighter sentence.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.516
When Wendy explained it to him,
he seemed to understand.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.270
I think he wasn't sure
he could convince a jury.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.648
-This way it's airtight.
-He didn't try.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.988
No hard feelings, okay?

26:55.405 --> 26:57.365
I know the outcome
wasn't what you wanted.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.827
All three behind bars,
and Benjamin'll fry for what he did.

27:00.910 --> 27:04.998
Not all bad.
You know what we're up against.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.710
We have to consider the attention span
of a prospective jury pool.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.170
Need to keep them in mind.

27:10.670 --> 27:14.132
Our objective is the lowest cost
for the highest quality of justice.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.383
You know this is bullshit.

27:17.218 --> 27:18.553
Let me get you a steak sandwich.

27:18.636 --> 27:20.555
Outside of KC,
it's the best I've come across.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.849
-No, thanks.
-I've lost my appetite.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.392
We need to hit the road.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.896
Okay. Thank you for everything.

27:39.407 --> 27:41.034
What difference does any of this make

27:41.117 --> 27:43.662
if we can't communicate it
to the people who matter?

27:45.330 --> 27:46.498
I don't know.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.059
[Carr]  It's all about process now.

28:06.142 --> 28:10.021
Refining our methodology, making sure
we're airtight and idiot-proof.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.231
So we need more subjects.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.608
-Ones just like Kemper, please.
-Those were the days.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.362
You know, you're going to see people
present with similar pathologies,

28:17.445 --> 28:19.114
but the way a person kills

28:19.197 --> 28:22.242
is as individual and distinct
as the way they have sex.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.743
And just as complicated.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.372
Jerome Brudos. King of souvenirs.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.457
-Brudos? The shoe guy?
-[Holden] Who's he?

28:29.541 --> 28:33.169
Six, seven years ago.
Sometimes he wore women's dresses.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.547
[Carr] He amputated the breasts
of his first and third victims.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.008
-Just like Benjamin.
-It's themed. Wendy loves a pattern.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.052
It's all about finding patterns.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.138
Except he went a little further
than Benjamin.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.433
He plaster cast the breasts
and made them into bronze paperweights.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.517
He's creative.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.729
[Carr] His second victim, he amputated
a foot which he stored in his freezer.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.772
He had a collection
of hundreds of women's shoes

28:52.856 --> 28:54.649
which he used for masturbation.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.610
-I think we can learn a lot from this guy.
-I'm in.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.864
This time we use the questionnaire.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.700
Did we settle on that?

29:03.783 --> 29:06.995
We have to be able to distinguish
the fractal similarities and differences

29:07.078 --> 29:08.747
so that we can codify it clearly.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.707
Otherwise, we're just wasting our time.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.751
Sure, but sometimes
you got to go with your gut.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.462
And when you first walk in,
you can trust your instinct.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.338
But once you get your subject talking,

29:17.422 --> 29:20.675
we need the protocols
so we can build a consistent data set.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.219
-Makes sense.
-What else do we know about Brudos?

29:23.303 --> 29:26.347
[Carr] As a teenager, he started grabbing
lingerie from clotheslines.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.557
Soon he was breaking into homes,

29:27.640 --> 29:30.310
stealing women's underwear,
shoes, and dresses.

29:30.393 --> 29:33.313
And then eventually, he escalated
to kidnapping and murder.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.315
But he was married with two children
by then.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.650
This file is as thick as an encyclopedia.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.153
You think we're gonna get something
that isn't in here?

29:40.236 --> 29:41.446
Absolutely.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.073
In all that paperwork,
there's not a single word

29:44.157 --> 29:45.825
that illuminates
what he was thinking or feeling,

29:45.909 --> 29:48.161
before, during, or after the crimes.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.747
There's nothing
on his operation principles, his logic.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.957
-Logic?
-[Carr] His internal logic, yes.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.460
Which, hopefully, one day
we'll be able to decipher.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.798
So, we all agreed. Brudos is next.

29:59.881 --> 30:00.799
Yes.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.343
Do you mind if I take that room?

30:04.219 --> 30:06.429
-For what?
-For my office.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.264
[Tench] Oh, sure, fine. Go ahead.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.476
-[Holden] Do you need help?
-No.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.687
I actually enjoy this part,
organizing my space.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.690
She's staying.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.484
Carver was right.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.487
You really are Sherlock Holmes.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.880
It's one generous bedroom
and a newly refurbished kitchenette.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.257
The building's very quiet.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.884
Mostly professionals
and mostly travelers.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.596
Flight attendants, a few pilots.
We get the odd lecturer.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.223
Are you married?

30:50.932 --> 30:51.891
No.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.768
Were you thinking month-to-month?

30:53.852 --> 30:54.978
To begin with.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.188
-Are they all furnished?
-Yes.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.482
And that's definitely part
of the complex's allure.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.734
Just pick up your keys and off you go.

31:03.611 --> 31:07.448
We do have some singles activities,
if you're up for that sort of thing.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.326
And there's access
to quite a good tennis pro.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.161
I'm going to be working long hours.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.791
What made you choose this part
of Virginia, if you don't mind my asking?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.586
-Quantico.
-Oh!

31:20.628 --> 31:22.088
Are you with the Bureau?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.134
I guess... uh, mainly research.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.927
Oh. Very exciting.
