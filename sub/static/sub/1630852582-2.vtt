00:19.750 --> 00:22.375
I'm glad you were able
to come back to Tokyo.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.833
It's not a big deal.
You're on a transfer here too.

00:26.916 --> 00:28.583
Right, my dear brother?

00:29.083 --> 00:29.916
Yes.

00:32.375 --> 00:36.458
Going from a PR firm
to the Cabinet Secretariat,

00:37.041 --> 00:38.541
that's one heck of a step up!

00:40.125 --> 00:42.458
As deputy director,
I only have a support role,

00:43.250 --> 00:46.541
but I never imagined I'd be working
for the national government.

00:46.625 --> 00:49.000
I'm worried whether you can even do it.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.250
-Don't do anything stupid and get fired.
-How can you say that?

00:53.833 --> 00:57.833
You may be joking, but you can't imagine
the pressure that's on me.

00:58.791 --> 01:02.041
I might even have to write
a speech for the prime minister.

01:02.875 --> 01:06.125
That's amazing! I wish you all the best.

01:09.166 --> 01:10.458
I wish you the best too.

01:11.416 --> 01:13.375
So pick up the tab sometimes, okay?

01:15.750 --> 01:16.625
Fine.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.333
-In here.
-Thank you.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.333
Ms. Matsuda.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.625
-You can go in now.
-Thank you.

02:48.458 --> 02:49.875
Sorry. Thank you.

03:15.458 --> 03:16.458
Kohei…

04:18.083 --> 04:18.958
<i>This is</i>

04:20.458 --> 04:23.083
<i>the Cabinet Intelligence</i>
<i>and Research Office.</i>

04:29.166 --> 04:31.208
I think you know what CIRO does.

04:31.791 --> 04:34.875
If information reaches the public
unfiltered, it can cause confusion.

04:34.958 --> 04:38.041
It's our job to filter out
massive amounts of information.

04:42.791 --> 04:44.875
First, determine all the people

04:44.958 --> 04:47.250
who may be obstacles
in this Eishin Academy affair,

04:47.333 --> 04:50.666
including all the journalists
and reporters pursuing it.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.083
Yes, sir.

05:18.583 --> 05:19.750
EISHIN ACADEMY PURCHASE

05:21.083 --> 05:22.500
CHUBU LOCAL FINANCE BUREAU
DELETE PAYMENT HISTORY

05:40.083 --> 05:40.958
Good.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.958
We'll submit these.

05:50.458 --> 05:53.458
Thank you for all your hard work.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.750
It's okay.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.541
Let's trust Mr. Kurosaki.

06:13.708 --> 06:14.541
Right.

07:21.416 --> 07:24.500
<i>Considering the circumstances,</i>
<i>it's patently obvious</i>

07:24.583 --> 07:26.166
that favors were given.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.625
Wasn't the PM's Office involved?

07:29.666 --> 07:32.250
The Prime Minister's Office
was not at all involved.

07:32.916 --> 07:35.500
Once the records come out,
it will be clear as day.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.333
Since we weren't involved in it,

07:37.416 --> 07:39.958
there certainly aren't records
that will show as such.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.166
Next question.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.333
That was a definitive statement.

07:46.833 --> 07:47.708
Yes.

07:47.791 --> 07:50.041
NAGOYA REGIONAL PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE

07:50.125 --> 07:51.958
They can't turn back now.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.166
They could try to cover it up.

07:55.708 --> 07:59.666
What a lot of commotion
over just a simple discount.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.041
It's not just a simple discount.
This is a huge problem.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.708
There's no reason for us
to go chasing it though.

08:05.791 --> 08:09.250
Isn't this exactly the kind of case where
Special Investigations should be involved?

08:10.541 --> 08:11.916
Let's wait and see.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.916
It could be a lie made up by the press.

08:22.958 --> 08:25.208
Statements in the Diet
and the records don't match.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.375
Don't try to clean up the documents.

08:29.291 --> 08:33.416
Destroy all traces whatsoever
of the price negotiations.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.333
Do you plan on revising records every day

08:40.000 --> 08:42.791
so they're in line with
statements made in the Diet?

08:42.875 --> 08:44.166
That's what we'll do.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.208
I can't do this anymore. Please.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.375
Suzuki!

08:51.500 --> 08:54.375
Until now, I've always served loyally
as a public servant.

08:54.916 --> 08:57.625
I am proud to be
a member of the Finance Bureau.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.375
-Then continue this work.
-But this…

09:02.333 --> 09:04.041
-This is a crime.
-Suzuki!

09:04.125 --> 09:06.833
Call it what you will,
but it's a breach of people's trust!

09:07.416 --> 09:08.416
It seems to me

09:09.750 --> 09:13.750
that you don't understand what
the job of a national public servant is.

09:21.041 --> 09:22.125
I told you.

09:23.166 --> 09:25.208
I will bear all responsibility for this.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.166
Then, at the very least,

09:35.500 --> 09:37.500
take Kijima and the others off this task.

09:39.791 --> 09:41.375
I'll do this alone.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.708
At any rate, make sure it gets done.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.291
Delete all digital files of the records
before they have been altered.

10:22.916 --> 10:24.125
Excuse me.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.000
I'm Anna Matsuda of Touto News.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.750
You work in the Finance Bureau, right?

10:31.500 --> 10:34.666
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
May I have a moment of your time?

10:35.208 --> 10:36.500
What's this about?

10:38.708 --> 10:41.500
You're Kazuya Suzuki, aren't you?

10:44.708 --> 10:47.541
I'd like to ask you about Eishin Academy.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.333
I don't know anything about it.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.166
Welcome home.

11:34.625 --> 11:37.291
-You sure are late tonight.
-Yes.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.250
Were you drinking?

11:41.041 --> 11:43.958
Yes, a little. Just with some co-workers.

11:44.958 --> 11:48.625
That's unusual.
You could have called me to let me know.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.541
I'm sorry.

11:53.583 --> 11:54.625
Kazuya?

11:58.041 --> 11:59.041
Are you okay?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.666
Why do you ask?

12:08.375 --> 12:09.958
I'm perfectly fine.

12:57.375 --> 12:58.666
MAKE PROMPT PAYMENT

13:00.541 --> 13:02.875
AFTER OBTAINING PROPER APPROVALS

13:04.916 --> 13:06.041

13:06.625 --> 13:08.166
AFTER REMOVING WASTE

13:14.291 --> 13:15.458
CHECK NECESSITY OF REMOVAL

13:15.541 --> 13:16.750
OPEN ISSUES REMAIN

13:16.833 --> 13:18.166
REMOVAL WAS COMPLETED

13:18.250 --> 13:19.333
ISSUES WERE RESOLVED

13:23.708 --> 13:25.375
Matsuda of Touto News.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.000
<i>Regarding Eishin Academy,</i>

13:27.083 --> 13:29.541
<i>the Ministry of Finance</i>
<i>has yet to satisfactorily explain</i>

13:29.625 --> 13:31.541
<i>the reason for the discounted price for--</i>

13:31.625 --> 13:33.041
<i>Keep your questions brief.</i>

13:33.125 --> 13:35.250
<i>They haven't provided</i>
<i>a satisfactory explanation</i>,

13:35.333 --> 13:36.875
<i>and there have been calls for</i>

13:36.958 --> 13:40.583
Finance Bureau Director-General Mouri
to testify before Parliament.

13:40.666 --> 13:43.500
Don't you believe
the administration needs to provide

13:43.583 --> 13:45.958
a proper explanation regarding this issue?

13:46.958 --> 13:51.041
The administration and ruling party
will have discussions on the matter.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.750
<i>Then as for the records</i>
<i>of the negotiations that were shredded--</i>

13:56.833 --> 13:58.458
<i>Please get to the point.</i>

13:58.541 --> 14:02.166
<i>Do you believe that the handling</i>
<i>of official documents was appropriate?</i>

14:02.666 --> 14:03.916
<i>To the best of my knowledge,</i>

14:04.000 --> 14:06.791
<i>official documents were handled</i>
<i>in accordance with</i>

14:06.875 --> 14:08.500
<i>document management regulations.</i>

14:08.583 --> 14:11.375
<i>However, I am unaware of</i>
<i>the status of individual documents.</i>

14:11.958 --> 14:13.958
You'll have to ask the relevant agency.

May I have a moment of your time?

14:56.541 --> 14:58.875
-Sorry. Excuse me.
-Regarding the Eishin Academy…

15:37.958 --> 15:39.625
<i>Again today, the opposition party</i>

15:39.708 --> 15:42.250
<i>aggressively questioned</i>
<i>the administration in Parliament</i>

15:42.333 --> 15:45.791
<i>about the Eishin scandal involving</i>
<i>the purchase of public land at a discount.</i>

15:47.541 --> 15:50.416
<i>Why don't we summon</i>
<i>those involved and settle this?</i>

15:50.500 --> 15:51.541
<i>-That's right!</i>
<i>-Do it!</i>

15:51.625 --> 15:55.416
<i>Chairman, I request that Finance Bureau</i>

20:09.166 --> 20:10.708
Did something happen at work?

20:13.541 --> 20:14.833
Like what?

20:17.333 --> 20:18.166
I mean,

20:19.666 --> 20:22.250
lately, you never talk about work with me.

20:23.583 --> 20:26.458
I can see on TV
how difficult it must be for you now,

20:27.458 --> 20:28.666
so I've been worried.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.416
Sorry.

20:36.208 --> 20:40.250
I was told not to talk to anyone about it.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.041
That makes sense.

20:47.041 --> 20:49.916
You're sworn to secrecy after all. Sorry.

22:36.791 --> 22:37.708
I'm sorry. I just…

22:37.791 --> 22:39.458
Who said you could look at that?

22:46.791 --> 22:48.416
Why were you looking at my cell phone?

22:49.541 --> 22:52.708
I had to. It just kept on ringing.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.041
Kazuya.

23:11.416 --> 23:12.500
What happened?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.333
I'm sorry.

23:39.083 --> 23:39.916
I…

23:42.708 --> 23:45.291
I think I may have done
something terrible.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.041
Kazuya.

Kazuya…

EISHIN DOCUMENTS
SUSPECTED OF BEING TAMPERED WITH

24:26.458 --> 24:27.375
Matsuda.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.291
Yes, I saw it.

24:30.791 --> 24:32.708
Maicho beat us to it.

24:33.250 --> 24:36.500
-This is an incredible scoop.
-Right.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.750
EISHIN DOCUMENTS
SUSPECTED OF BEING TAMPERED WITH

24:40.833 --> 24:43.416
I wonder who their source was.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.041
It has to be an insider.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.041
Good afternoon.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.166
That's a hell of an article in the paper.

25:11.875 --> 25:14.666
-I bet you're on tenterhooks.
-Yes.

25:17.333 --> 25:21.583
If this issue gets dragged out any longer,
it'll turn into a quagmire for sure.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.958
If we can't make progress
on matters in the Diet,

25:26.041 --> 25:27.625
people may lose faith in us.

25:29.416 --> 25:30.541
You understand, right?

25:31.791 --> 25:32.625
Yes.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.125
Mouri.

25:38.916 --> 25:40.791
I have a favor to ask you.

25:45.708 --> 25:48.250
EISHIN DOCUMENTS
SUSPECTED OF BEING TAMPERED WITH

25:54.958 --> 25:58.541
I'd hate to think it's possible,
but none of you leaked this, did you?

26:03.916 --> 26:05.333
Do you know who it might be?

26:07.541 --> 26:08.541
Suzuki.

26:10.041 --> 26:11.125
What about you?

26:12.291 --> 26:13.125
No.

26:14.291 --> 26:15.375
I wouldn't do that.

26:19.833 --> 26:20.916
At any rate,

26:22.583 --> 26:25.000
we're bound to be busy
handling this for a while.

26:25.916 --> 26:29.416
If you learn anything about this,
share it with us immediately.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.916
For now, we'll wait
for a decision from above.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.208
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

26:55.458 --> 26:56.375
Come in.

26:57.916 --> 26:58.958
Excuse me.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.500
You read the article, right?

27:10.333 --> 27:11.166
Yes.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.125
There are sure to be more forceful demands

27:14.208 --> 27:17.250
in the press and on social media
for the truth to be revealed.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.375
Get help
from our supporters on the Internet

27:19.458 --> 27:21.875
to suppress reaction to it
as much as possible.

27:23.000 --> 27:23.958
Certainly, sir.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.083
Also,

27:26.750 --> 27:30.458
Finance Bureau Director-General Mouri
will be stepping down.

27:35.041 --> 27:36.666
It wasn't an easy decision,

27:37.500 --> 27:39.750
but allowing this issue
to go on any longer

27:39.833 --> 27:42.208
would be a huge negative
for the administration.

27:45.583 --> 27:46.416
What's wrong?

27:47.583 --> 27:48.500
Nothing.

27:51.166 --> 27:54.875
I just think I am partially responsible
for what's happened to Mr. Mouri.

27:56.625 --> 27:57.708
Don't worry about it.

27:58.333 --> 28:01.041
For those in the appropriate position,
shouldering responsibility

28:01.125 --> 28:02.958
is a fundamental part of any organization.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.333
Yes, sir.

28:07.666 --> 28:08.708
I'll be going.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.791
<i>…about last night's announcement</i>

28:18.875 --> 28:21.291

<i>Mouri's resignation.</i>

28:21.375 --> 28:22.708
FINANCE BUREAU DIRECTOR-GENERAL
MOURI RESIGNS

28:22.791 --> 28:24.833
That was a sudden resignation.

28:25.458 --> 28:28.333
I guess that means
they fabricated the documents.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.750
I wouldn't be so sure.

28:30.833 --> 28:36.375
They could be sacrificing him
so no more questions get asked.

28:36.875 --> 28:37.750
Really?

28:37.833 --> 28:40.125
Then who knows
what you can believe in anymore.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.458
-Yes.
-I'm back.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.208
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

28:43.291 --> 28:44.875
<i>I informed the finance minister</i>

28:44.958 --> 28:48.708
<i>of my intention to resign my position</i>
<i>as Finance Bureau director-general.</i>

28:48.791 --> 28:50.708
This is about Eishin Academy, right?

28:51.416 --> 28:54.375
What's this?
You're showing some interest now?

28:54.458 --> 28:57.416
Yes. In fact, that's my hometown.

28:58.791 --> 29:01.208
Really? Is that so?

29:04.041 --> 29:06.000
Goodbye.

29:06.083 --> 29:07.458
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

29:07.541 --> 29:08.625
Mayu!

29:13.166 --> 29:15.625
Are you free after this?

29:17.000 --> 29:17.916
What for?

29:18.583 --> 29:20.125
Don't be like that.

29:21.333 --> 29:23.458
Well, I did what I could

29:23.541 --> 29:27.000
to read up on current events,
but I didn't understand them at all.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.416
I'd also like to
ask you about job hunting.

29:31.041 --> 29:33.625
How come you're suddenly
so interested in that stuff?

29:33.708 --> 29:35.375
What? Is it a problem?

29:35.458 --> 29:38.500
Be warned, my tutoring fees
are pretty darn high.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.000
Buy me breakfast.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.500
Okay, sure.

29:43.875 --> 29:44.875
Hold on a sec.

29:47.958 --> 29:52.875
SUSPICIONS DEEPEN DIRECTOR-GENERAL MOURI
IS TAKING FALL BY RESIGNING

29:52.958 --> 29:54.458
It's no good. I still don't get it.

29:55.333 --> 29:58.125
How many times
do I have to explain it to you?

29:58.208 --> 30:01.000
Ultimately, what's the big deal?

30:02.666 --> 30:04.750
I don't know a whole lot of details.

30:06.208 --> 30:10.041
But basically only people close to the PM
are getting favorable treatment.

30:10.583 --> 30:13.708
Really? So what's wrong with that?

30:14.500 --> 30:18.000
Are you really a university student?
Study up on democracy, would you?

30:18.083 --> 30:19.166
Okay, I get it!

30:21.208 --> 30:22.250
By the way…

30:23.125 --> 30:24.958
-Yes?
-You know this reporter?

30:25.875 --> 30:26.708
I sent you a link.

30:31.958 --> 30:34.208
No, I don't know her. What is this?

30:34.291 --> 30:35.375
Watch it.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.041
<i>Matsuda of Touto News.</i>

30:38.125 --> 30:39.666
<i>Regarding Eishin Academy,</i>

30:39.750 --> 30:43.000
<i>the Ministry of Finance</i>
<i>has yet to satisfactorily explain…</i>

30:43.083 --> 30:45.541
She drills the chief cabinet secretary
with questions,

30:46.208 --> 30:48.791
but she gets totally dissed on Twitter.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.833
<i>…and there have been calls for…</i>

30:51.916 --> 30:53.791
She's incredible.

30:54.708 --> 30:56.083
I could never do that.

30:56.166 --> 30:58.708
<i>…a proper explanation</i>
<i>regarding this issue?</i>

30:58.791 --> 31:00.375
I think she's pretty great.

31:01.583 --> 31:03.250
She's got real conviction.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.458
<i>Please go ahead.</i>

31:07.041 --> 31:09.041
<i>As for the records</i>
<i>of the negotiations that were shredded--</i>

31:09.125 --> 31:10.000
Hey.

31:10.083 --> 31:11.041
<i>Please get to the point.</i>

31:11.125 --> 31:12.791
But, you know, I don't think

31:12.875 --> 31:15.833
a single reporter pressuring them
like this changes a thing.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.541
It seems like everything
in politics is decided by the bigwigs.

31:22.958 --> 31:24.333
Do you seriously believe that?

31:26.625 --> 31:27.625
Well,

31:28.833 --> 31:32.541
I wouldn't say I'm serious about it.
But it's always been like that, right?

31:34.833 --> 31:36.333
Are you okay with that, Ryo?

31:39.750 --> 31:41.916
I don't really know.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.375
Well, if it means we've got peace.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.166
-The hell it's acceptable!
-That hurt!

31:52.666 --> 31:54.625
-What?
-I'm going to class.

31:54.708 --> 31:55.666
Okay.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.916
Thanks for breakfast.

32:19.833 --> 32:20.916
How's your progress?

32:21.416 --> 32:23.666
Good. I'll finish a list
of opposition lawmakers

32:23.750 --> 32:25.250
and reporters by the end of the week.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.083
-I see.
-Yes.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.958
The public is going to become
even more riled up soon.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.166
What do you mean?

32:35.541 --> 32:39.041
Finance Bureau Director-General Mouri
will testify before Parliament.

32:42.458 --> 32:45.333
-I was involved--
-You can rest easy, Murakami.

32:46.458 --> 32:49.208
If we can ride this out,
it'll be forgotten in a few months.

32:49.791 --> 32:50.958
Just hold out until then.

33:10.541 --> 33:13.708
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

33:15.041 --> 33:18.583
I can't take it any longer.

33:22.666 --> 33:25.916
I cannot accept this.
I want you to reconsider.

33:33.625 --> 33:37.958
After Mr. Mouri's testimony tomorrow,
things will go back to normal.

33:38.041 --> 33:41.333
That's not the problem here.

33:44.083 --> 33:45.458
Please understand, Suzuki.

33:45.541 --> 33:47.666
I know this has upset you,

33:48.666 --> 33:51.791
but stick this out
for your family's sake. Okay?

34:31.250 --> 34:32.750
As I thought, it was you.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.208
That day…

34:42.833 --> 34:45.250
what did you want to tell me?

34:46.791 --> 34:49.166
The day after your call,
that article came out.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.333
Was the leak…

34:53.125 --> 34:54.500
from you, Mr. Suzuki?

34:56.375 --> 34:57.500
It wasn't me!

34:58.750 --> 35:02.750
Then if there's anything you know,
please tell me.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.250
I…

35:12.500 --> 35:14.208
I don't know anything.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.875
Tomorrow,

35:16.958 --> 35:20.333
Finance Bureau Director-General Mouri
will testify in the Diet.

35:20.416 --> 35:21.708
What are your thoughts?

35:21.791 --> 35:24.375
-I have nothing to say to you!
-I'm sorry.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.875
Then I have one final question.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.291
-Would you quit following me?
-Mr. Suzuki.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.041
I saw the record of your transfer.

35:32.125 --> 35:34.708
You were reassigned
at an unusual time, yes?

35:46.666 --> 35:49.625
It was different than
the usual timing for transfers.

35:52.833 --> 35:54.541
Can you tell me

35:56.083 --> 35:57.791
why you were transferred?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.125
Mr. Suzuki?

36:12.375 --> 36:13.666
Excuse me.

36:30.291 --> 36:32.375
If you're asked
about anything problematic,

36:32.458 --> 36:36.083
avoid answering by claiming
you could be criminally implicated.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.541
I'm sure the questioning will be brutal.

36:40.375 --> 36:41.458
Can you handle it?

36:43.083 --> 36:44.166
No problem.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.166
Mouri…

36:50.208 --> 36:54.083
I appreciate the hard work
you've done over the years.

37:01.625 --> 37:04.625
<i>We will now commence</i>
<i>the Budget Committee meeting.</i>

37:05.291 --> 37:08.125
<i>As part of our examination</i>
<i>of budget implementation,</i>

37:08.208 --> 37:12.666
<i>we will now conduct witness testimony</i>
<i>regarding the falsification of documents</i>

37:12.750 --> 37:17.666
<i>related to the land deal made with</i>
<i>Eishin Academy Educational Corporation.</i>

37:18.791 --> 37:22.625
<i>Are you Yoshikazu Mouri?</i>

37:23.458 --> 37:25.041
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

37:26.333 --> 37:31.875
<i>Then, as stipulated by law,</i>
<i>the witness will be sworn in.</i>

37:32.541 --> 37:34.916
Everyone, please stand.

37:37.625 --> 37:43.500
<i>I, Yoshikazu Mouri, swear that</i>
<i>I will tell the truth according to</i>

37:43.583 --> 37:46.875
<i>the dictates of conscience,</i>
<i>without hiding anything</i>

37:47.375 --> 37:50.083
or adding anything.

37:52.958 --> 37:56.958
<i>I'd like you to tell us the truth about</i>
<i>why the documents were altered</i>

37:57.041 --> 37:59.083
<i>and who ordered that it be done.</i>

38:00.666 --> 38:02.125
<i>Mr. Mouri.</i>

38:02.208 --> 38:05.500
FORMER FINANCE BUREAU
DIRECTOR-GENERAL YOSHIKAZU MOURI

38:06.250 --> 38:09.291
First, as for the altering
of approval documents that took place

38:09.375 --> 38:11.416
at the Chubu Local Finance Bureau,

38:12.500 --> 38:15.833
the alterations were done
within Chubu Local Finance Bureau.

38:15.916 --> 38:17.083
That is undeniable.

38:18.958 --> 38:20.750
<i>This is a specific case</i>
<i>regarding documents</i>

38:20.833 --> 38:23.333
<i>held at the Chubu Local Finance Bureau</i>

38:23.416 --> 38:25.291
<i>related to a former public waste site.</i>

38:25.375 --> 38:26.833
He admitted to it.

38:26.916 --> 38:29.625
He's admitted to the fabricating.

38:30.416 --> 38:33.041
<i>When it comes to specific cases like this…</i>

38:33.125 --> 38:33.958
He said it.

38:34.041 --> 38:37.791
<i>…we don't normally consult</i>
<i>the Cabinet Secretariat,</i>

38:37.875 --> 38:40.166
<i>and we don't notify them.</i>

38:40.250 --> 38:42.500
He's just taking the fall
so they can cut their losses.

38:42.583 --> 38:43.416
Yes.

38:43.500 --> 38:47.458
No notification was made
to the Prime Minister's Office.

38:47.541 --> 38:52.458
This was something that only happened
within the Finance Bureau.

38:56.166 --> 38:59.916
<i>You have stated that the alterations</i>
<i>took place within the Finance Bureau,</i>

39:00.000 --> 39:02.041
<i>but please allow me to reconfirm this.</i>

39:02.541 --> 39:05.041
Did the prime minister or the First Lady

39:05.125 --> 39:08.083
direct you or the Finance Bureau
to conduct these alterations?

39:09.250 --> 39:10.250
Mr. Mouri.

39:12.291 --> 39:13.208
No, they did not.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.583
He's asserting everything under oath!

39:16.666 --> 39:19.291
<i>Did the prime minister's secretary</i>
<i>direct you to do it?</i>

39:19.375 --> 39:20.791
<i>Mr. Mouri.</i>

39:21.541 --> 39:22.708
<i>No, he did not.</i>

39:25.333 --> 39:26.875
<i>Were these alterations made</i>

39:27.708 --> 39:30.791
<i>in order to remove the prime minister's</i>

39:30.875 --> 39:33.291
<i>and the First Lady's names</i>
<i>from the records?</i>

39:34.833 --> 39:35.875
<i>Mr. Mouri.</i>

39:37.000 --> 39:40.083
As for the details of the alterations
that were made,

39:40.583 --> 39:43.500
since I could be criminally implicated,
I cannot answer that.

39:46.458 --> 39:47.583
<i>Mr. Masato Ono.</i>

39:48.333 --> 39:50.875
<i>Did the chief cabinet secretary,</i>
<i>deputy chief cabinet secretary,</i>

39:50.958 --> 39:55.125
<i>secretary to the prime minister,</i>
<i>or finance minister direct you to do this?</i>

39:56.750 --> 39:57.958
Mr. Mouri.

39:59.625 --> 40:00.625
No, they did not.

40:01.208 --> 40:05.916
<i>It was done entirely at the discretion of</i>
<i>the Chubu Local Finance Bureau.</i>

40:06.875 --> 40:11.500
<i>The First Lady's name appears</i>
<i>numerous times in these documents.</i>

40:12.041 --> 40:15.958
<i>Didn't you get the feeling that</i>
<i>the administration was somehow involved?</i>

40:16.708 --> 40:19.208
Since I could be criminally implicated,
I cannot answer.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.416
I mean…

40:21.500 --> 40:23.541
You've got to be kidding me.

40:24.791 --> 40:27.291
<i>This testimony is useless!</i>

40:28.291 --> 40:31.041
<i>You're completely evading</i>
<i>all the difficult questions!</i>

40:31.125 --> 40:33.541
<i>-That's right! Explain!</i>
<i>-Chairman!</i>

40:34.125 --> 40:36.583
<i>This testimony is meaningless.</i>

40:37.500 --> 40:39.083
<i>-Do an investigation!</i>
<i>-That's right!</i>

41:00.125 --> 41:01.333
I'm sorry.

41:03.416 --> 41:05.000
Why are you apologizing?

41:07.875 --> 41:10.833
Isn't it pathetic
that your husband has ended up like this?

41:13.083 --> 41:15.291
Of course it's not. You know that.

41:19.166 --> 41:23.500
Sometimes I see a police car drive by.

41:26.708 --> 41:28.083
Every time I do,

41:29.791 --> 41:32.416
I wonder if they're coming to arrest me.

41:36.208 --> 41:37.625
Get some rest.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.708
You've been working non-stop for a while.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.583
I'll be back again tomorrow.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.416
Mayumi.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.083
Thank you.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.458
You get plenty of rest.

42:55.750 --> 42:58.000
Mr. Suzuki, you have visitors.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.041
Excuse me.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.291
It's nice to meet you.

43:07.375 --> 43:10.458
I'm Yagawa from the
Nagoya Regional Public Prosecutors Office.

43:17.083 --> 43:18.875
I think you've already been told.

43:20.583 --> 43:24.000
I have nothing to say about this.

43:26.041 --> 43:27.041
I know.

43:29.458 --> 43:32.750
Naturally, you have the right
to remain silent, Mr. Suzuki.

43:35.041 --> 43:38.708
If you can only answer the questions
you can answer, that is fine.

43:39.708 --> 43:42.291
You don't need to answer
anything you don't want to.

43:42.375 --> 43:44.375
You can even remain silent throughout.

43:50.291 --> 43:51.125
Then…

43:53.041 --> 43:55.166
I would like to remain silent.

44:01.958 --> 44:02.958
Excuse me.

44:03.958 --> 44:04.958
May I sit?

44:11.625 --> 44:12.625
Mr. Suzuki.

44:15.208 --> 44:18.583
The only people who know the truth
behind the Eishin Academy affair

44:20.125 --> 44:21.666
are you and your co-workers.

44:27.333 --> 44:30.666
We cannot allow this issue
to just fade away.

44:31.708 --> 44:32.625
Won't you please…

44:34.666 --> 44:36.083
tell us the truth?

44:44.958 --> 44:46.666
I…

44:48.500 --> 44:49.666
I…

44:51.041 --> 44:53.666
did my job for the sake
of the Japanese people.

44:54.375 --> 44:55.875
That's what I've always done!

45:01.041 --> 45:03.875
I refused to do it.

45:05.166 --> 45:08.916
I told them I didn't want to.
I told them it was a cover-up.

45:10.958 --> 45:11.791
I…

45:14.708 --> 45:17.583
wanted to do a job
my wife could be proud of!

45:18.666 --> 45:19.541
Mr. Suzuki.

45:20.666 --> 45:23.000
I wanted to be a husband
she could be proud of!

45:35.458 --> 45:36.375
What…

45:38.625 --> 45:40.208
will happen to me?

45:43.958 --> 45:45.833
Don't worry, Mr. Suzuki.

45:48.208 --> 45:53.083
We don't want to know what you did.

45:54.333 --> 45:57.500
We just want to know what you know.

46:11.666 --> 46:14.416
INVESTIGATION STARTS
AFTER BEING PRESSED BY MEDIA

46:19.250 --> 46:23.375
Articles on the Eishin scandal
are getting smaller by the day.

46:27.666 --> 46:29.208
I won't let it end just yet.

46:50.458 --> 46:51.541
Suzuki!

47:00.791 --> 47:02.250
How are you feeling?

47:03.083 --> 47:04.208
I'm not sure.

47:05.666 --> 47:08.833
But they say I can go home next week.

47:13.208 --> 47:14.458
That's good news.

47:23.458 --> 47:25.166
Apparently,

47:25.833 --> 47:29.083
the leak about the altered documents
was from someone in Eishin Academy.

47:30.125 --> 47:32.166
I'm sorry I suspected you.

47:35.083 --> 47:36.083
Is that so?

47:39.291 --> 47:43.125
Earlier, a public prosecutor visited me.

47:45.416 --> 47:47.416
They paid me a visit too.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.083
That made me worry about you,
so I came to visit.

47:54.666 --> 47:55.791
Mr. Kurosaki.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.041
Yes?

48:01.333 --> 48:04.500
Do you remember our time at
the Shizuoka Local Finance Office?

48:09.541 --> 48:10.375
Yes.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.958
You were so kind.

48:17.791 --> 48:20.208
You were so much more talented
than the others

48:21.291 --> 48:23.708

Can I ask you one thing?

49:57.833 --> 49:58.958
What is it?

50:03.375 --> 50:05.083
Did you have me transferred here

50:06.916 --> 50:08.625
in order to alter the documents?

50:16.541 --> 50:18.333
Of course I didn't.

50:24.208 --> 50:26.125
I'm glad to hear that.
