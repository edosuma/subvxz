00:01.080 --> 00:04.460
Dre: America has been described
as a cultural melting pot.

00:04.460 --> 00:06.790
Every major city
has neighborhoods

00:06.790 --> 00:08.750
that reflect that diversity.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.420
And they all have
something to offer.

00:11.420 --> 00:14.170
People can go to Little Italy
for great pasta,

00:14.170 --> 00:17.210
Chinatown for acupuncture
and Eastern medicine,

00:17.210 --> 00:19.420
and the Black part of town
for...

00:20.580 --> 00:22.040
...nothing.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.620
Because most Americans
avoid the Black parts of town,

00:25.620 --> 00:28.380
and we could get into
all the reasons why.

00:28.380 --> 00:31.330
White flight, red lining,
lack of business investment,

00:31.330 --> 00:34.080
slumlords, predatory lending,
restrictive covenants...

00:34.080 --> 00:35.880
I could go on.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.330
But let's just say "racism."

00:38.330 --> 00:40.670
See, while other
cultural neighborhoods

00:40.670 --> 00:42.580
are seen as exotic,

00:42.580 --> 00:46.750
Black ones are stereotyped
as dangerous.

00:46.750 --> 00:50.170
But these neighborhoods
are lively and vital.

00:50.170 --> 00:51.830
They go by a lot of names --

00:51.830 --> 00:56.330
Harlem, Watts,
Treme, and Atlanta.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.580
But they're all
one thing to us --

00:58.580 --> 01:00.080
home.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.040
Yep.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.460
Oh, hey!
Hey, guys!

01:02.460 --> 01:03.540
So, how was
your day out?

01:03.540 --> 01:04.920
It was great.
Mm-hmm.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.210

kids are scared of Black people.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.830
What are you
talking about?

01:17.830 --> 01:18.960
Well, uh,
they got scared

01:18.960 --> 01:20.420
as soon as they got
to my neighborhood.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.580
I would say "scurred," but I
think that would be too black,

01:22.580 --> 01:24.170
and I don't want them
afraid of me, too.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.460
Okay, guys...
Oh, Rhonda.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.830
What did you do?

01:26.830 --> 01:28.120
Nothing.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.620
Don't -- Don't listen
to Auntie Rhonda.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.080
Yeah. How can we be
afraid of Black people?

01:32.080 --> 01:33.460
We're Black people.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.830
Mm. Mm-hmm.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.000
Okay, then why did you
lock the car door

01:37.000 --> 01:38.330
as soon as
we crossed Adams?

01:38.330 --> 01:41.250
Jack's deathly afraid
of falling out of moving cars.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.330
It's called
"hodophobia."

01:42.330 --> 01:43.460
Google it.
Mm-hmm.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.330
What about Jack
standing at the front door

01:45.330 --> 01:47.670
the entire time we were at
the LeBron James Krispy Kreme?

01:47.670 --> 01:49.330
Jack's deathly afraid
of earthquakes.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.670
Seismophobia.

01:50.670 --> 01:51.790
What else you got?

01:51.790 --> 01:53.500
The soul food spot,

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
when you said you needed to
go to the bathroom as a group

01:55.500 --> 01:56.790
"just to be safe."

01:56.790 --> 01:59.330
Jack's deathly afraid
of hand dryers.

01:59.330 --> 02:01.290
I'm a mess, okay?
What?

02:01.290 --> 02:03.000
This is your fault,
Dre.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.960
If the boy is soft,
it's because of Bow.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.120
What?!

02:06.120 --> 02:08.000
I told you not to nurse him
for that long.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.790
Dre, you told me we needed
to save money on food.

02:10.790 --> 02:13.920
Dre, the reason they're scared
of Black neighborhoods

02:13.920 --> 02:16.080
is because you don't bring them
down there enough.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.830
But since you have hundreds
of dollars just chillin'

02:18.830 --> 02:20.170
so you can buy
some diamond earrings,

02:20.170 --> 02:21.880
I'm sure you can turn your back
on the community.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.540
Okay, first off,
they cost thousands of dollars.

02:25.540 --> 02:29.040
And secondly, I did not
turn my back on my community.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.420
I'm not down there often
because it's too far.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.210
I've seen you drive 15 miles
for a Cronut.

02:35.210 --> 02:37.540
That's nothing.
Have you ever had a Cronut?

02:37.540 --> 02:39.330
You talkin' 'bout
how my baby like Cronuts?

02:40.330 --> 02:42.580
Okay, look,
Rhonda,

02:42.580 --> 02:44.290
we work hard

You're never seen
as an equal.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.170
It's not a ghetto.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.880
Well, it's still a place
that I would not feel safe.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.290
Exactly --
like Syria

06:15.290 --> 06:16.290

Is that the new euphemism, Dre?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.500
Oh, let -- let --
let me try this.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.170
Okay, you know what else
is inconvenient?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.210
Pit bulls.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.250
Rap concerts.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.710
A Lakers game.

07:03.710 --> 07:06.920
I find any Martin Luther King

07:06.920 --> 07:08.250
I see
what you're doing.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.120
And those racist fears

07:10.120 --> 07:12.710
are what keeps our communities
on the margin

07:12.710 --> 07:14.920
while others become
the nation's fabric.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.670
I, for one, am not afraid
of our neighborhoods.

07:18.670 --> 07:19.920
Yeah, well...

07:19.920 --> 07:21.290
your kids may be.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.670
I have a suburban kid,

07:22.670 --> 07:24.540
and it takes real effort
for me to make sure

07:24.540 --> 07:26.580
that Eustace is comfortable
in a Black neighborhood.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.080
You make a good point.
My kids are pretty suburban.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.670
I don't know who,

07:31.670 --> 07:33.920
but one of them
is DVR-ing "Riverdale."

07:33.920 --> 07:35.620
The best.
Mm. Unbelievable.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.540
Maybe I should check in and
make sure they're not afraid.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.670
That's smart.
Worked for Eustace.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.040
Now he's good
in the hood.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.500
I could drop him off
anywhere...

07:43.500 --> 07:45.380
and have.

07:48.330 --> 07:49.420
"Riverdale"!

07:49.420 --> 07:50.420

No way!
Really?!

08:10.250 --> 08:11.250
Yes way.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.670
We can make a day
out of it --

08:12.670 --> 08:15.580
dinner downtown,
hanging out downtown.

08:15.580 --> 08:16.710
Sound cool, right?

08:16.710 --> 08:18.330
Yeah! This is
gonna be awesome!

08:18.330 --> 08:20.540
Oh, wait a minute.
I messed up.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.420
I bought Travis Scott tickets
for the Forum...

08:23.420 --> 08:24.670
in Inglewood.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.080
Inglewood?

08:27.080 --> 08:29.460
Like...
Inglewood Inglewood?

08:29.460 --> 08:31.500
Yes! Inglewood.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.120
I mean, we'll still
make a day out of it --

08:33.120 --> 08:37.170
dinner in Inglewood,
hanging out in Inglewood, right?

08:37.170 --> 08:39.290
Um...I mean...

08:39.290 --> 08:42.120
obviously, we're -- we're --
you know, still --

08:42.120 --> 08:43.540
we still want
to do it, but...
Yeah.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.580
...maybe -- maybe we should
just do the concert, you know?

08:45.580 --> 08:47.670
Get in, get out.
Exactly.

08:47.670 --> 08:49.750
We don't want to weigh
on your busy schedule

08:49.750 --> 08:52.170
by making
a whole day out of it.

08:52.170 --> 08:54.420
Yeah, it seems like
it's gonna be inconvenient.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.710
Yeah. Good one.
Mm-hmm.

08:55.710 --> 08:57.330
Damn it.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.500
You are scared
of Black neighborhoods.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.460
W-Whoa!
What are you doing?!

09:02.460 --> 09:06.210
Destroying $400
to teach you a lesson.

09:06.210 --> 09:10.000
Clear out your Saturday
and sag your pants,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.040
because we are hanging
with the Blacks.

09:13.540 --> 09:17.210
And I mean Black Blacks.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.420
All right, Dad.
Ready to go.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.120
All right, great.
Hey, meet me in the car.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.210
I'll just finish punching in
Rhonda's address,

09:27.210 --> 09:30.830
and we'll be on our way
to South Los Angeles.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.500
Ah.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.250
All right.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.000
You seriously don't remember how
to get to your sister's house?

09:41.000 --> 09:44.460
I remember important things,
like birthdays.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.620
When's mine?

09:45.620 --> 09:47.080
The same as hers.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.080
And when's mine?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.330
Two minutes before his.

09:50.330 --> 09:51.880
♪ ...gettin' weak,
and my gun might blow ♪

09:51.880 --> 09:54.250
♪ But we gon' be all right ♪

09:54.250 --> 09:55.880
♪ We gon' be all right ♪

09:55.880 --> 09:57.670
I can't believe

09:57.670 --> 10:00.620
this was the place
my kids were afraid of.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.120
The lawns are mowed.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.880
There are no loose dogs.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.830
People are jogging.

10:05.830 --> 10:08.500
That's right -- jogging.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.830
This place is safe.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.040
No -- it's a treasure.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.790
In fact, all kinds
of famous people lived here --

10:16.790 --> 10:20.000
Ice Cube, Tina Turner,
John Singleton,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.290
Meghan Markle, Issa Rae,

10:22.290 --> 10:25.000
and former mayor Tom Bradley.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.170
This neighborhood is known
as the Black Beverly Hills.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.920
And there's no better way
to round off our visit

10:31.920 --> 10:33.750
to this vibrant community

10:33.750 --> 10:35.750
than a delicious
soul food lunch

10:35.750 --> 10:37.540
at the iconic Lorraine's.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.460
Hold up for a second.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.830
I need you guys
to understand

10:41.830 --> 10:43.920
why places like this
are special.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.540
Restaurants like Lorraine's
are places you can go

10:47.540 --> 10:49.170
to take the armor off.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.960
See, everyone here
is Black,

10:50.960 --> 10:53.210
and that should make you
feel at home.

10:53.210 --> 10:56.210
Yeah, it may not
look like much.

10:56.210 --> 10:58.210
Furniture needs
to be updated.

10:58.210 --> 11:00.420
That door needs to be fixed.

11:00.420 --> 11:04.290
But for us,
places like these are temples,

11:04.290 --> 11:08.500
libraries, therapists' offices,
and second homes,

11:08.500 --> 11:12.330
because here,
you can just be.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.920
You can also eat here,
Professor Johnson.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.330
This ain't
no Negro museum. Damn!

11:18.330 --> 11:19.580
Negro, let's eat.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.880
Well, it is
a Negro Museum.

11:23.170 --> 11:24.670
Morning, Mark.
How are the kids?

11:24.670 --> 11:26.540
Oh, excuse me.
Pardon me. Sorry.

11:26.540 --> 11:27.830
Doctor coming through.

11:27.830 --> 11:29.000
I'm a doctor!

11:30.250 --> 11:32.040
Hey.
Hey.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.460
Junior,
what are you doing here?

11:33.460 --> 11:34.830
Is that --
Is that my lab coat?

11:34.830 --> 11:35.960
Shh!

11:35.960 --> 11:38.500
I came to help you shake
the "mom" label, right?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.000
I'll pretend
to be your resident,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.580
then you can
ream me out,

11:41.580 --> 11:44.380
and people will see
that you are a boss!
Okay.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.830
Uh-oh!
What's happening?

11:45.830 --> 11:49.170
I spilled all of the blood,
Dr. Johnson!
N-- Oh, it's okay!

11:49.170 --> 11:51.420
Oh, no!
How could I?
All right, okay.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.750
We're gonna clean that up!
All right.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.170
What are you doing?

11:55.170 --> 11:58.210
Look, I already put that label
in a body bag.

11:58.210 --> 12:01.880
I will no longer be
cutting cakes or wiping noses.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.040
Not me.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.120
You were wiping noses?

12:05.120 --> 12:06.500
Not anymore.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.250
Dr. Johnson.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.540
Can we talk?

12:12.670 --> 12:14.830
It has been
such a hard week.

12:14.830 --> 12:16.500
I've lost five patients.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.120
Suck it up!

12:20.120 --> 12:21.750
Wait, wha--
Ah, ah!

12:21.750 --> 12:23.920
Do I look like your mom?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.210
I said...

12:25.210 --> 12:29.540
do I...look like...
your mom?

12:30.620 --> 12:31.830
I mean, a-a little.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.710
Well,
I am not your mama.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.500
And if you're gonna
"wah, wah, wah"

12:37.500 --> 12:39.750
and "boo-hoo-hoo"
like a little pee-pee pants,

12:39.750 --> 12:41.290
you need to call
your mama --

12:41.290 --> 12:43.920
who I am not.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.330
Yeah.

12:46.710 --> 12:47.960
Ice-cold.

12:47.960 --> 12:48.750
Yeah.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.960
I-I'm scared of you.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.290
You should be.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.830
You know that people don't learn
unless you teach 'em, right?

12:53.830 --> 12:55.080
And I taught 'em.
Yeah.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.670
Dr. Collins:
I know she's not my mama,

12:56.670 --> 12:59.380
but I thought
she was my friend.

12:59.380 --> 13:02.120
Well, she seems nice,
but she's...

13:02.120 --> 13:03.750
kind of a monster.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.750
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, son.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.830
It's okay for you to eat
your chicken without silverware.

13:11.830 --> 13:13.000
There's
no judgment here.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Go on, eat up.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.830
Free at last, right?

13:16.830 --> 13:19.330
You know what's also good
about this spot?

13:19.330 --> 13:21.080
Nobody bothers you.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.670
See that lady over there
that looks like Laila Ali?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.330
Ain't nobody gonna
go up to her and say,

13:25.330 --> 13:26.710
"Are you Laila Ali?"

13:26.710 --> 13:27.880
'Cause that is Laila Ali.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.380
Hey, Laila!

13:29.380 --> 13:31.330
Hey, girl.
How you doing?

13:31.330 --> 13:32.420
Good.
How you doing?

13:32.420 --> 13:33.620
Well, good to see you.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.170
So, this is my brother,
and, um...

13:36.170 --> 13:38.790
his kids
are scared of you.
Hi.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.170
Stop --
Scared?

13:40.170 --> 13:43.670
Oh, because I was an undefeated,
undisputed world champion?

13:43.670 --> 13:45.210
No, no,
not at all, actually.

13:45.210 --> 13:46.420
It's because
you're brown.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.790
Shame on you, brother.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.170
She lyin'.

13:53.170 --> 13:54.420
I'll see you, girl.

13:54.420 --> 13:56.540
I'll see you, girl.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.500
I still don't believe
that was Laila,

13:58.500 --> 14:00.830
but either way,
ain't nobody sweatin' her.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.880
I mean, the food is
kind of good.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.540
Secret ingredient?

14:04.540 --> 14:06.920
400 years
of our history.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.420
You can taste
the struggle.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.330
All right, you know what?
Let's just calm down.

14:10.330 --> 14:13.210
We know you're Black, with
your multiple savings accounts

14:13.210 --> 14:14.960
and your diamond earrings.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.170
Where are
your diamond earrings, Dre?

14:18.170 --> 14:19.960
I took 'em out.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.580
I'm sorry -- what?

14:21.580 --> 14:23.830
Um, you know, you...

14:23.830 --> 14:27.460
just can't wear jewelry
like that anywhere.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.750
So you can wear
five-carat diamond earrings

14:29.750 --> 14:31.120
in your neighborhood,

14:31.120 --> 14:33.750
but you can't wear
diamond earrings in mine?

14:33.750 --> 14:36.120
I'm not new to this.
All right?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.750
And it kind of defeats the
purpose of me taking them out

14:38.750 --> 14:41.460
if you're gonna be loud
about me having them.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.000
You're such a hypocrite.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.500
It's called street smarts.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.830
Because we're in
a bad neighborhood?

14:46.830 --> 14:49.580
No, baby. It's all about
being careful, okay?

14:49.580 --> 14:51.460
Which is what I do.

14:51.460 --> 14:52.500
Is it?

14:54.420 --> 14:55.420
Oh, hey, excuse me.

14:55.420 --> 14:56.620
Would you mind
watching my things

14:56.620 --> 14:57.880
while I go
to the restroom?

14:57.880 --> 14:59.000
No problem.
All right.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.880
Ooh!
These slim-fit pants.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.830
'Cause it seems like
you're acting

15:05.830 --> 15:07.170
a little scared, too,
Dad.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.710
No, I'm not.

15:08.710 --> 15:11.500
All right?
I am amongst my people.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.210
I feel safe
and at home here.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.120
Oh, cover me!
Everybody down!

15:16.120 --> 15:17.960
Get down, son!
Cover me!

15:18.920 --> 15:21.790
Dre, you wanna tell me
any Black facts about the floor?

15:27.710 --> 15:29.670
Oh! Hey, babies.

15:29.670 --> 15:30.710
How was your day out?

15:30.710 --> 15:32.960
Great. Dad hit the deck
at Lorraine's,

15:32.960 --> 15:34.670
so we never have to
listen to him again.

15:34.670 --> 15:36.500
And we also got back
our Saturday,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.000
so it's a win-win.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.750
Oh, Andre!

15:39.750 --> 15:40.830
I know, Mama.

15:40.830 --> 15:42.290
Come on, now.

15:42.290 --> 15:44.000
In front of Lorraine?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.210
Yes, Mama.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.500
It doesn't make any sense.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.670
I know Leimert Park
is the Black Beverly Hills.

15:48.670 --> 15:51.210
Yeah, the worst thing
that can happen is...

15:51.210 --> 15:54.290
maybe you get into
a fender bender
with Carl Weathers.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.620
I took my earrings out
like something was gonna happen,

15:56.620 --> 15:58.580
even though I knew
nothing was gonna happen.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.170
Something's off with me.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.580
I was so worried that
the kids would be unfamiliar,

16:02.580 --> 16:04.920
but...
I'm unfamiliar, too.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.000
My old boyfriend Amadou
used to feel the same way.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.830
You had a boyfriend
named Amadou?

16:10.830 --> 16:13.120
Yeah, must've been one of the
ones I didn't tell you about.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.120
Hmm.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.710
Anyway,
he was from Senegal,

16:16.710 --> 16:18.830
grew up
only speaking French.

16:18.830 --> 16:22.000
Came over here and started
using English every day.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.290
So when he'd go back
to Senegal,

16:25.290 --> 16:29.120
he felt like he understood
French less and less.

16:31.170 --> 16:33.420
I used to spend all my time
with only Black people,

16:33.420 --> 16:35.710
but now I don't.

16:35.710 --> 16:37.210
Maybe that's what I lost.

16:37.210 --> 16:41.250
See? Amadou's helping you
the same way he helped me.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.580
O...kay.
How did he help you?

16:43.580 --> 16:47.670
Well, he got me into
my Senegalese twist phase.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.420
You know, I got him
in my phone book

16:53.420 --> 16:55.920
as "Ama-do not call,"

16:55.920 --> 16:58.710
but I think
I'm-a do call him tonight.

16:58.710 --> 17:02.210
You see, this magazine's
got me all in a flutter.

17:02.210 --> 17:04.330
Oh, yeah.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.500
Well, it's official.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.380
I am no longer the mom.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.580
Now I am the bitch.

17:13.580 --> 17:15.170
B--
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

17:15.170 --> 17:16.960
Hey! Look at me!

17:16.960 --> 17:18.880
You are not that word.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.170
I should've known.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.290
The moment
I shook the mom label,

17:24.290 --> 17:26.920
I was gonna get pigeonholed
with a new one.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.170
Women always
get labeled --

17:29.170 --> 17:32.080
"drama queen,"
"kid sister,"

17:32.080 --> 17:35.120
"party animal,"
"one of the guys."

17:35.120 --> 17:37.500
Ugh.
That is so stupid!

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
I mean,
nobody is one thing.
I know.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.830
I'm a nerd,

17:40.830 --> 17:42.830
a sharp dresser...
Yes, you are,
sweetheart.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.080
...a podcast
connoisseur...
Yeah!

17:45.080 --> 17:46.330
...night nurse.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.330
Plus, I have sex
a regular amount!

17:48.330 --> 17:50.210
Wow! Wow.

17:50.210 --> 17:51.790
Right. Yep.
Let's not go there.

17:51.790 --> 17:55.080
We have an honest
and open relationship.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.580
Some would say
that it's too honest.

17:57.580 --> 17:59.830
Yeah, it's -- it's come up
with every girl I've dated.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.210
You are right.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.170
I'm not one thing.
Yup.

18:05.170 --> 18:07.420
And I'm not gonna
play their game...
Okay.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.670
...and be defined
by one label or another.
Mm-hmm. Yeah!

18:10.670 --> 18:14.210
I'm gonna be who I want to be
when I want to be it.
Right.

18:14.210 --> 18:16.460
Yeah!
I am so proud of you, Mom.
Aah!

18:16.460 --> 18:17.500
Thank you,
sweetheart, yeah.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.670
You are every woman.
It is all in you.

18:19.670 --> 18:20.880
Okay.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.380
Are you -- Are you --
Are you -- Is that --

18:22.380 --> 18:23.830
Are you quoting
"I'm Every Woman"?

18:23.830 --> 18:27.000
I...may have been...listening
to that this morning at the gym

18:27.000 --> 18:29.040
while I blasted out
my quads.
Oh.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.380
I am also a gym rat.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.080
Hoo!

18:38.790 --> 18:40.000
Oh, hey, guys.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.250
Don't fill up
on breakfast,

18:41.250 --> 18:44.330
because we are going back
to Lorraine's for lunch.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.040
Come on, Dad.
We were just there.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.580
Yeah. I know.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.500
We're making up
for lost time.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.290
You guys grew up
in the suburbs,

18:51.290 --> 18:55.250
so I know going to
a neighborhood like Rhonda's

18:55.250 --> 18:57.500
may make you feel
a little different.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.710
It kind of does.

18:58.710 --> 19:00.500
So many people
who look like me,

19:00.500 --> 19:03.170
but I feel like
I don't fit in.

19:03.170 --> 19:06.120
It's like when everyone knows
the words to a song except you.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.960
Like "Happy Birthday."

19:07.960 --> 19:10.540
You don't know how many times
I faked my way through that.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.330
All right, look, you feeling
like you don't fit in

19:13.330 --> 19:15.960
is exactly why we need
to go there more often.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.000
I don't want you feeling
out of your element

19:18.000 --> 19:21.790
in a place that's supposed to
absolutely feel like home.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.380
I get that.

19:23.380 --> 19:25.000
All right.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Are you ready
to have some fun?
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.830
You know, Auntie Rhonda
was talking about

19:28.830 --> 19:30.170
some cool art
by the park.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.620
Okay.
We'll check that out.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.290
And she was
also talking about

19:33.290 --> 19:35.380
good smoothies
at Simply Wholesome.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.500
She's right.
We'll get those, too.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.620
Ooh, ooh! What about, um,
the Slauson Swap Meet?

19:40.620 --> 19:41.880
Done!

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Growing up in this neighborhood
has allowed my kids

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
to experience things
I never could have.

19:50.500 --> 19:54.380
Still, they're missing out
on a lot.

19:54.380 --> 19:57.330
So I'm gonna make sure they
spend as much time as possible

19:57.330 --> 20:01.000
in the places that allow you
to just be you.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.120
Hey, Lorraine.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.580
You know what?

20:03.580 --> 20:05.330
I love
this picture.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.210
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

20:15.210 --> 20:18.170
So, Bow decided she was
going to shake the labels

20:18.170 --> 20:19.880
by becoming all of them.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.580
I got you a card.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.920
I will not cut this cake.

20:26.670 --> 20:27.790
Okay.

20:27.790 --> 20:29.500
Susanne, your hair
looks amazing like this.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.540
I really love it.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.880
Put your eyes back in your head.
I saw you, horn dog.

20:36.380 --> 20:40.330
Hey, guys, should we all
sign up for softball?

20:41.830 --> 20:45.330
No, I am not bringing snacks,
you lazy bastards!

20:47.170 --> 20:48.620
All right,
got to get that icing.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.920
Hommm!

20:51.830 --> 20:54.620
Cake for me, peace to you.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.420
Seems exhausting...

20:56.420 --> 20:57.830
for everyone.

20:57.830 --> 20:59.880
-Mom!
-Shh! Daddy's working!
