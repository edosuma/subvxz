01:41.960 --> 01:45.380
We now turn to the hostile nation
of North Korea.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.700
The rocket they are testing
is big enough...

01:47.800 --> 01:50.660
to reach the West Coast
of the United States.

01:50.760 --> 01:54.820
Today, an official of the United Nations
tried to tell the world...

01:54.920 --> 01:56.740
so there will be no mistake...

01:56.840 --> 02:00.100
that we are living in the midst
of a modern-day Hitler.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.660
A young, untested leader
with nuclear ambition...

02:03.760 --> 02:05.460
- Kim Jong-un.
- Kim Jong-un.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.860
We are talking about Kim Jong-un.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.540
Good evening. I'm Dave Skylark.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.180
Tonight, we are joined
by 13-time Grammy winner...

02:15.280 --> 02:18.380
Oscar-winning songwriter, Detroit's own:

02:18.480 --> 02:19.580
Eminem.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.820
He'll speak with us about his new album
which has been mired in controversy...

02:23.920 --> 02:27.060
concerning lyrics
that some view as demeaning...

02:27.160 --> 02:28.980
to the elderly.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.340
Tonight...

02:30.440 --> 02:32.349
on Skylark Tonight.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.300
And...

02:42.400 --> 02:43.865
action.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.900
"It's hell to be Shady

02:46.000 --> 02:50.420
Yesterday, I yelled a degrading insult
At an elderly lady

02:50.520 --> 02:53.900
Then I asked her how it felt to be 80

02:54.000 --> 02:56.980
F-word a senior citizen

02:57.080 --> 02:59.501
Suck a wiener, sit and spin"

03:00.120 --> 03:02.666
- "Suck a wiener, sit and spin"
- It's funny.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.700
"And why you drive so slow for?

03:05.800 --> 03:08.620
Don't you wanna get
Where you're going faster

03:08.720 --> 03:11.500
Since you'll probably die tomorrow
You old whore?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.420
Die, old bitch, die

03:13.520 --> 03:15.220
Before I murder you"

03:15.320 --> 03:17.140
What do you mean by this, Em?

03:17.240 --> 03:20.860
Well, first of all,
I feel like when I rap, like...

03:20.960 --> 03:22.780
people twist my words.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.340
Okay. But can you see
how an old person might say:

03:26.440 --> 03:30.580
"I think what this guy is telling me,
this Eminem...

03:30.680 --> 03:35.024
is that I should go kill myself,
and, you know, I don't like that"?

03:36.160 --> 03:39.180
I mean, I don't necessarily rap about...

03:39.280 --> 03:40.940
the things that I hate.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.500
It's more about the things that I fear.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.740
I get you.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.780
- If I talk about women or whatever.
- Yes.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.460
A lot of that is more or less me
just dealing with issues with...

03:52.560 --> 03:54.620
old issues with my mom or whatever.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.151
With your mother?

03:56.600 --> 03:59.740
Yeah, or, you know, when I say things
about gay people...

03:59.840 --> 04:02.180
or people think
my lyrics are homophobic.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.870
It's because I'm gay.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.700
- When I rap about violence...
- Wait.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.620
...or, you know,
sound like I'm promoting violence...

04:09.720 --> 04:12.700
- ...I think that it's more or less...
- What? What? What?

04:12.800 --> 04:16.579
...because, you know, it's kind of
about me just confronting it.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.100
What did he just say?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.660
He said he was gay.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.180
Dave. Dave, we're pretty sure
we just heard him say he was gay.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.460
Em, let's just back it up a moment.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.060
You...

04:28.160 --> 04:29.420
just said...

04:29.520 --> 04:31.588
that you were gay?

04:33.160 --> 04:37.300
And I'm just curious
what you meant by that exactly.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.786
I mean I'm gay.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.140
I'm a little confused here
because "gay" can mean a lot of things.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.024
I am a homosexual.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.351
Meaning...?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.511
I like men.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.420
What the fuck just happened?

04:55.520 --> 04:59.260
Eminem said he was gay four times.
That's what the fuck just happened.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.580
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.060
Eminem's gay on our show.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.660
Oh, my God. Camera two.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.540
Gay Twitter's blowing up.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.420
Change the chyron. "Eminem gay?!"

05:09.520 --> 05:12.220
Dave, keep him talking.
Keep him talking.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.700
Push in on gay Eminem.
The greatest moment in gay history!

05:15.800 --> 05:19.060
...are probably shocked
by what you're saying right now.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.980
I'm more shocked
that people haven't figured it out.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.460
It's like I've been playing
gay peekaboo.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.420
- Gay peekaboo.
- Yeah.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.820
- But...
- Shit. Camera one.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.020
- This interview is over. Shut it off.
- No! Get out of here.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.620
I am Marshall's publicist.
Pull the plug now.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.020
This is gold! This is the best interview
we've ever done!

05:38.120 --> 05:39.740
What happens if I do this?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.580
- Don't touch my buttons!
- Shut it off! Shut it off!

05:42.680 --> 05:45.980
- Get him the fuck out of here!
- I'm gonna murder you!

05:46.080 --> 05:49.582
Thank you. Dave, look, I got the lyrics.
Say what I say.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.580
What did you mean when you rapped:

05:52.680 --> 05:54.780
"I said nice rectum, I had a..."

05:54.880 --> 05:56.780
"...vasectomy, Hector

05:56.880 --> 06:02.020
So you can't get pregnant
If I bisexually wreck ya"?

06:02.120 --> 06:05.940
I've pretty much just been leaving
a breadcrumb trail of gayness.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.740
- I see that now.
- You know?

06:07.840 --> 06:10.900
But, yeah, actually,
Hector was a real person.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.180
Hector and his rectum were real.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.620
- It's real! Hector's rectum is real!
- Holy shit. Yes!

06:16.720 --> 06:18.820
- Slim Shady, everyone!
- I knew it!

06:18.920 --> 06:21.380
- Dude, dude!
- Aaron. Bring it in.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.503
- Oh, my God.
- Bring it in, big boy!

06:23.800 --> 06:24.947
Oh, my God.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.500
- Oh, my God.
- What the heck just happened?!

06:28.600 --> 06:31.460
The real Slim Shady just stood up.
That's what happened!

06:31.560 --> 06:35.180
- This is like Spike Lee said he's white!
- I can't believe this.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.580
- You the man! You the man!
- You're the man!

06:37.680 --> 06:40.140
- You're the best!
- You're the best.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.311
Listen, I'm gonna go get my makeup off.
I want you to meet me downstairs.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.380
Dude, where are we going?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.780
I thought we were
going to the Hamptons.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.460
- What is this place?
- We're just, you know...

06:51.560 --> 06:53.020
just hanging out.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.460
- Okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.220
It's a surprise party for you.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.740
What? Why?
Why did you just tell me that?

06:59.840 --> 07:02.420
Because I'm so excited!
This is gonna be great!

07:02.520 --> 07:05.820
- I don't understand what's happening.
- Surprise!

07:05.920 --> 07:08.540
All right, all right,
I already told him!

07:08.640 --> 07:12.420
- You're the best in the world, cocksucker.
- Not now, Malcolm. Come on.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.420
Thank you. Why is this happening?

07:14.520 --> 07:17.500
You've been with us for 1000 episodes!

07:17.600 --> 07:20.226
- Are you kidding me?
- Ten years, baby!

07:20.680 --> 07:23.386
- Come on.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.101
All right, now, I know
we all like to keep it light, keep it fun.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.661
I'm gonna take it to a serious tip.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.100
I'm gonna talk about Aaron.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.020
Before we started working together,
my show barely broke the top 15.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.500
So I called this professor
at the Columbia School of Journalism...

07:44.600 --> 07:47.020
that I was having sex with, and I said:

07:47.120 --> 07:50.660
"I need someone smarter
than anyone in entertainment!

07:50.760 --> 07:52.350
I need a real journalist!"

07:52.800 --> 07:54.300
Aaron, you are...

07:54.400 --> 07:56.460
the Samwise Gamgee...

07:56.560 --> 07:58.380
to my Frodo Baggins.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.580
You are the Gandalf to my Bilbo Baggins.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.860
But of all The Lord of the Rings
references I could make...

08:04.960 --> 08:07.427
this is the most important:

08:08.120 --> 08:09.790
I am Gollum.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.469
And you're my precious.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.980
SmÃ©agol needs Aaron.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.940
One Ring to rule them all!

08:19.040 --> 08:21.460
And in the darkness bind them.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.420
Now, get up here! Get up here!

08:24.520 --> 08:26.740
- Come up here, buddy. I love you.
- Okay.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.590
- I fucking love you.
- I love...

08:33.520 --> 08:34.905
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.147
Jake.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.179
Hey.

08:40.039 --> 08:43.419
Yeah, like, what's that?
Come on, man, what's happening?

08:43.520 --> 08:46.300
- Hey, yeah. What's happening?
- How's it going, dude?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.020
We haven't seen each other
since graduation. Right?

08:49.120 --> 08:51.260
Yeah. Probably.

08:51.360 --> 08:55.580
And, wait, am I wrong? You're
a junior producer on 60 Minutes, right?

08:55.680 --> 08:59.740
- I'm now a senior producer. Yeah.
- No way, man. That's awesome.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.940
Look at us.
Both producing news for television.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.141
Yeah.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.660
- What was that?
- Nothing.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.940
It was something. What's the joke?

09:09.040 --> 09:12.260
You've got your job, I've got mine.
But they're different.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.100
Yours is cool.
Mine's just a little more serious.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.260
What? We have the same job.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.420
I report real news.
You know, stuff that matters.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.420
You report on all the cool:
"Who's getting new boobs?"

09:23.520 --> 09:25.420
And the fun eating-disorder stuff.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.420
You really helped build up
60 Minutes too, right?

09:28.520 --> 09:31.900
- It's only been on for 80 fucking years.
- Look, I'm sorry.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.300
I shouldn't say this,
but we got an opening at 60 Minutes.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.820
- And we could use somebody like you.
- Are you serious?

09:38.920 --> 09:42.860
I'm fucking with you, man. Come on!
You'd be eaten alive at our office.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.700
I'm gonna catch up with these guys,
but cheers, man, congrats.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.345
Or whatever.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.740
When did the hair begin to go?

09:54.840 --> 09:58.069
I would say, around The Outsiders.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.106
When you're ready.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.140
I don't think I'll ever be ready, but...

10:06.240 --> 10:08.342
Oh, wig's coming off.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.740
Oh, Jesus fuck.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.620
Why does he keep the long pieces?
His head looks like somebody's taint.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.100
- You barely look different.
- Thanks, man.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.460
You said you were bald.
I see a little stuff on top.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.310
- So freeing!
- Rob.

10:29.200 --> 10:33.191
Is there anything that you would like
to say to America?

10:38.400 --> 10:42.061
Good evening. I'm Phillip Sterling
with a UBS News special report.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.460
Kim Jong-un's military forces...

10:44.560 --> 10:47.340
targeted an uninhabited
South Pacific island...

10:47.440 --> 10:50.460
with a 15-megaton thermonuclear ICBM.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.060
We're not live anymore.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.900
- They cut our feed.
- Off the air?!

10:54.000 --> 10:55.300
Goddamn it!

10:55.400 --> 10:58.620
Rob, put your fucking wig on.
They fucked us. Goddamn it!

10:58.720 --> 11:00.345
What's going on?

11:01.160 --> 11:04.740
Dude, seriously, what is up with you?

11:04.840 --> 11:07.180
Know how I'm good
at picking up energies?

11:07.280 --> 11:11.540
You're shooting off a slightly cunty
vibe right now. What's going on?

11:11.640 --> 11:14.700
We have millions of viewers every night
and what do we do?

11:14.800 --> 11:18.860
We just shovel shit into their faces.
We could be doing something positive.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.060
We could be having on authors,
activists, politicians.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.780
That's what people want.
"Give us some shit. Mangia.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.660
We're the people, give us the shit.
Mangia, mangia."

11:27.760 --> 11:29.500
I wanted to cover actual news...

11:29.600 --> 11:32.620
not Nicki Minaj's vagina
flopping out at the Grammys.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.620
- You don't like brown sugar?
- Nothing to do with that.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.551
I can't keep doing this, okay?
We have to change!

11:41.760 --> 11:42.980
Fine.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.860
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

11:44.960 --> 11:49.180
- Do you promise you'll do this?
- If you promise you'll never leave.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.460
- If you promise, I promise.
- Same time.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.620
- One, two, three. Promise.
- Promise.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.900
- Okay.
- Okay. That's all we had to say.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.260
- Don't put me through that.
- Fine. Okay.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.260
I hate it when we fight.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.540
No, this is not a joke, okay?

12:02.640 --> 12:05.580
- I think you're being condescending.
- Look, look, look.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.860
One sec.
Shut up, I'm on the phone, okay?

12:08.960 --> 12:11.700
Dude. The fuck, man?!
That was John Kerry's office.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.540
Forget that oak tree-looking fuck.
This tops it.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.860
The Times printed it about North Korea.
Read the bottom.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.740
After all the death-camp shit.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.180
"Although Kim Jong-un
rallies his people...

12:22.280 --> 12:25.900
with cries for the destruction
of the United States of America...

12:26.000 --> 12:29.380
he is known to be an avid consumer
of American entertainment.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.180
His favorite shows
are The Big Bang Theory..."

12:32.280 --> 12:33.870
And...?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.668
"...And Skylark Tonight."

12:40.280 --> 12:43.340
This is great!
This is what you were talking about!

12:43.440 --> 12:45.460
I interview this guy.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.660
Are you joking? He's the most
reclusive leader on the planet.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.740
He lives in North Korea.
We can't go there.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.500
Dave Skylark...

12:53.600 --> 12:54.940
gets in anywhere.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.820
Do you remember that club?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.900
Three-month waiting list. First night.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.140
I don't think it's quite the same thing.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.620
- There were a lot of Asian girls there.
- It's impossible, Dave.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.580
Here's what we'll do.
We're gonna do that interview.

13:08.680 --> 13:12.102
Everyone is gonna take you
super-duper seriously.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.620
- And then you're never gonna leave me.
- North Korea's in the Olympics, right?

13:16.720 --> 13:20.700
I bet they have an office to communicate
with the Olympic Committee...

13:20.800 --> 13:25.140
so there's probably some infrastructure
for communicating through that.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.820
- Those wheels are turning.
- If I leave a message for that office...

13:28.920 --> 13:32.060
then maybe, if they're a fan,
that can actually work.

13:32.160 --> 13:36.260
We could interview
the most famous man on the planet.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.140
Guys, some pictures just came out...

13:39.240 --> 13:42.020
where it looks like
McConaughey's fucking a goat.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.030
- McConaughey goat fuck?
- McConaughey goat fuck.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.060
We obviously have to have him on
to do that.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.500
So put that together.
But we're doing this North Korea thing.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.340
- First thing tomorrow.
- Book him!

13:54.440 --> 13:56.020
- Get him! Get the goat!
- On him.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.906
Get the goat!
I got some questions for that goat.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.460
This is Aaron Rapaport
from Skylark Tonight.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.300
We heard your Supreme Leader
is a fan of our show...

14:11.400 --> 14:13.500
and we'd love to have him on.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.060
Please get back to me.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.860
I'm about to head into a meeting,
but I'll be around in the morning.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.391
Hope to hear from you.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.341
Yeah.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.700
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.187
- Where to?
- Mercer and Spring, please.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.140
Hello?

14:39.240 --> 14:40.580
Hello? Who this?

14:40.680 --> 14:44.700
- I am trying to reach Aaron Rapaport.
- You got Aaron Rapaport. Who this is?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.500
You left word with our office
regarding an interview.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.140
Look, Dave, is this you?

14:49.240 --> 14:52.500
Because if it is,
you're doing a terrible Asian accent.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.180
Me so sorry. Me gots to go now, son.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.220
I am from the office of Sook-yin Park...

14:58.320 --> 15:02.140
Secretary of Communications for the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.501
Oh, my God.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.300
Shit. Me so sorry.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.900
I mean, I'm so sorry.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.980
I mean, I'm so sorr...
I'm so... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.180
We would like to discuss a meeting...

15:13.280 --> 15:16.060
between the Supreme Leader
and Dave Skylark.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.540
Security concerns dictate
the matter be discussed in person.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.100
Okay, great. Where do you do that?

15:22.200 --> 15:25.420
We will meet at latitude 40.1326.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.500
Longitude 123.9889.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.900
I'm not totally familiar
with my longitudes and latitudes.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.300
Where is that again?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.780
Fifty kilometers west of Dandong,
northeastern China.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.584
Did you just say "China"?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.148
And did you just say "dong"?

15:47.360 --> 15:50.031
I'm going to motherfucking China, y'all.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.300
Excuse me. Can I get in there?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.780
Thank you.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.141
Hi there.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.585
No, thank you. I'll just get it
through secondhand smoke.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.871
Selfie.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.545
Where the fuck are they?

16:54.040 --> 16:55.585
What the fuck...?

17:10.319 --> 17:11.580
No, no!

17:29.840 --> 17:31.140
I'm not...! No!

17:31.240 --> 17:33.940
I'm an American journalist.
Aaron Rapaport.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.302
I was invited here.
Please don't kill me!

17:36.680 --> 17:38.780
I come in peace! I'm here for interview.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.345
Please don't kill me!

17:53.800 --> 17:57.620
Mr. Rapaport, I am Sook-yin Park.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.020
The Supreme Leader
will grant an interview...

18:00.120 --> 18:02.380
to Mr. Skylark from inside North Korea.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.380
All questions will be supplied
by the Supreme Leader.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.789
Terms are nonnegotiable.
You have 24 hours to decide.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.700
- That's it?!
- Yes.

18:11.800 --> 18:16.700
Why didn't you tell me over the phone?
Or Skype? Do you guys have Skype?

18:16.800 --> 18:18.380
Okay, well...

18:18.480 --> 18:21.420
Look, could you give me some water?
That guy has water!

18:21.520 --> 18:23.540
Please give me a ride somewhere.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.620
I didn't pack well for this trip.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.427
I packed like a fool!
Like a goddamn fool!

18:29.960 --> 18:32.347
Please! Please!

18:48.720 --> 18:50.470
Damn, she was sexy.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.900
The fucking helicopter landed.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.780
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.700
Two soldiers jump out.
I think I'm gonna get killed!

18:57.800 --> 19:00.820
Then, out comes Sook.
I told you about her.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.860
She comes out. She's hot.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.220
- How hot?
- Super sexy.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.060
- Get in there?
- Yeah, I fucked her.

19:06.160 --> 19:10.020
- My fucking man!
- No, I didn't do that, dude. No!

19:10.120 --> 19:12.260
She said we can't ask our own questions.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.260
They were gonna write the questions.
We can't do it.

19:15.360 --> 19:19.100
We're essentially letting him
interview himself with your mouth.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.460
Look. Look at this buttfuck!

19:21.560 --> 19:25.180
He's got a whole parade of nukes.
He's ready to use them.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.460
When you score a bin Laden...

19:27.560 --> 19:29.140
or a Hitler...

19:29.240 --> 19:30.420
or an Un...

19:30.520 --> 19:32.940
you take it by the balls!

19:33.040 --> 19:36.700
It's the first rule of journalism.
Give the people what they want.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.180
That's not the first rule.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.260
That's the first rule of circuses
and demolition derbies.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.020
This is the biggest interview
since Frosty/Nixon.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.980
- "Frosty/Nixon"?
- In 10 years...

19:46.080 --> 19:48.220
Ron Howard's gonna make a movie
out of this.

19:48.320 --> 19:52.380
We do this, we can interview
any president on the planet.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.500
And then you can ask them
the real questions.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.220
This is like eating our vegetables.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.380
Once you eat those,
then you get to eat the steak.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.548
And we know Aaron wants his steak.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.540
This is like The Lord of the Rings.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.866
Okay?

20:09.320 --> 20:10.940
I'm actually like...

20:11.040 --> 20:12.904
Frodo Baggins.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.902
And you are my Sam.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.106
My Samwise.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.140
- I can't do it without you.
- Okay.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.308
Come with me to Mordor.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.824
- Okay. Let's fucking do it. Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.940
As always, I'd like to thank my guest:

20:34.040 --> 20:35.900
Joe Gordon-Levitt!

20:36.000 --> 20:39.860
And before we go,
I have a very special announcement.

20:39.960 --> 20:43.980
With the help of my outstanding
producer, Aaron Rapaport...

20:44.080 --> 20:48.540
I have secured the most important
interview of the 21st century.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.100
Three weeks from tonight...

20:50.200 --> 20:53.660
I will be traveling to Pyongyang,
North Korea...

20:53.760 --> 20:57.020
to conduct the first
globally broadcast interview...

20:57.120 --> 20:59.826
with President Kim Jong-un.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.940
I am deeply humbled
and profoundly honored...

21:03.040 --> 21:06.340
to accept this most awesome
responsibility.

21:06.440 --> 21:10.820
Apparently Dave Skylark will be
interviewing the dictator of North Korea.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.900
Hundred bucks, Skylark thinks
he's the guy from "Gangnam Style."

21:15.000 --> 21:17.700
...obscene glorification
of a brutal dictator.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.740
This is a man who tortures,
terrorizes and starves his own people.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.140
- Skylark is beneath despicable.
- Fuck this.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.580
Meow.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.100
What a fucking bitch, am I right?

21:29.200 --> 21:32.820
No, you're not right. He's not being
a bitch. He's completely right.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.580
He's motherfucking peanut butter
and jealous!

21:36.680 --> 21:38.140
He's not jealous.

21:38.240 --> 21:42.140
- He's putting K-Y jealous all over his dick.
- What is there to be jealous of?!

21:42.240 --> 21:44.220
Fuckers hate us because they ain't us.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.340
They hate us because we anus?
What does anus have to do with this?

21:47.440 --> 21:50.220
They hate us because they ain't us.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.860
That's not what it is.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.420
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.300
They hate us because we is us,
and what we is doing is fucking terrible.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.780
- They hate us because they ain't us.
- Stop saying that.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.580
- Hate us because they ain't us.
- They don't!

22:01.680 --> 22:03.580
Hate us because they ain't us.
I'm used to it.

22:03.680 --> 22:07.830
- They hate us because they ain't us.
- Stop it. Stop it. Don't say it again!

22:10.160 --> 22:11.500
Baby.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.225
Haters gonna hate.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.580
And ain'ters gonna ain't.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.180
That is not an actual thing
that people say.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.340
This is what you do to haters.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.383
You just smile.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.060
What is that?

22:31.160 --> 22:34.150
The strongest ecstasy
I've ever done in my life.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.226
Oh, what the fuck.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.981
Okay.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.861
Okay, I'm coming.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.470
Oh, shit.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.391
Oh, God.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.380
Mr. Rapaport.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.700
I'm Agent Lacey with Central Intelligence.
And this is my partner, Agent Botwin.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.143
Yo, Aaron, whoever that is,
tell them to fuck off.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.340
Dave, it's not...

23:28.440 --> 23:30.940
Yo, I don't know
who I fucked last night...

23:31.040 --> 23:33.347
but I got some stink dick.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.300
Yo, my dick stinks!

23:36.400 --> 23:38.460
So weird how you, like...

23:38.560 --> 23:41.140
just wanna keep smelling it, though.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.460
Yo, you gotta come over
and smell this shit!

23:43.560 --> 23:47.140
Come smell this. You gotta identify this.
I don't know what it is.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.700
Excuse him.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.300
He has stink dick.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.660
It kind of smells like guacamole.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.305
May we come in?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.300
Would you like a drink...

23:57.400 --> 23:59.540
or some of Aaron's cocaine?

23:59.640 --> 24:03.180
- This is not our coke. This is our...
- No, I'm sure it's not.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.460
So how can we...?
What can we do you for?

24:06.560 --> 24:09.743
- To what do we owe the pleasure?
- Well, Aaron, Dave...

24:10.200 --> 24:12.380
as I'm sure you know already...

24:12.480 --> 24:17.300
Kim Jong-un is now capable
of nuking all of the West Coast.

24:17.400 --> 24:21.860
The point is, we're talking about
nuclear nations at war with each other.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.420
Nuclear.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.940
He does have one tactical
advantage over the West.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.464
He's more than willing to let millions
and millions of his own people die.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.740
Explosions. All over my face.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.020
I'm sorry. We had kind of a long night.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.060
Why are you telling us
all this information?

24:40.160 --> 24:43.060
We're telling you this
because you two lucky gentlemen...

24:43.160 --> 24:45.260
are going to be in a room alone
with him.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.980
- And congratulations, by the way.
- That's right!

24:48.080 --> 24:49.620
Which is why we're here.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.980
The CIA would love it...

24:52.080 --> 24:53.700
if you two could...

24:53.800 --> 24:55.584
take him out.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.500
- Take him out.
- Take him out?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.300
- Like, for drinks?
- No, no, no.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.100
- Take him out.
- Take out.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.940
- Like, to dinner?
- Out to a meal?

25:06.040 --> 25:07.340
Take him out.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.940
- Like, on the town?
- Party?

25:09.040 --> 25:10.551
No...

25:11.640 --> 25:13.180
Take him out.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.940
You want us to assassinate...

25:15.040 --> 25:16.780
the leader of North Korea?

25:16.880 --> 25:19.620
- Yes.
- What?

25:19.720 --> 25:23.100
Won't they just get another chubby
dude with a goofy hairdo...

25:23.200 --> 25:26.740
- ...to come in and replace him?
- Exactly. Exactly.

25:26.840 --> 25:31.140
We're aware of a faction in the existing
leadership that already wants him gone.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.540
They're too scared to act alone.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.180
And they need you two
to go in there, remove Kim...

25:37.280 --> 25:40.220
embolden them to revolt...

25:40.320 --> 25:41.940
and take over.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.500
Are you, Agent Lacey,
going to be involved?

25:45.600 --> 25:48.380
I am going to be in your ear...

25:48.480 --> 25:52.220
by your side, every step of the way.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.149
Then I have one answer.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.308
No more Kim.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.540
You know what?
I think we should talk about it more.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.940
- All right, we're just gonna go talk.
- By all means.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.100
Just for the record,
I don't have stank dick.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.701
Come over here, come here, come in here.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.269
Dude. I think we need to do this.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.340
- She is so cool.
- You don't see what's happening.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.980
- And it's so obvious, it's crazy, man.
- What?

26:18.080 --> 26:20.060
- They're honeypotting us.
- What?

26:20.160 --> 26:23.780
It's an attractive spy woman
who lures men into doing shit.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.060
How can you not see that?

26:25.160 --> 26:27.700
- Because that is so sexist.
- Is it?

26:27.800 --> 26:30.340
This is 2014. Women are smart now.

26:30.440 --> 26:34.020
You think she just so happens
to have everything you find attractive?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.860
Bangs, giant tits, glasses?

26:36.960 --> 26:39.420
- They're fake, man.
- Fake glasses?

26:39.520 --> 26:43.020
- How could the CIA come up with that?
- That poor girl is blind as a bat.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.460
I'm just saying that when we're on molly
and when we're horned up, might not...

26:47.560 --> 26:49.860
- "Horned up"? Oh, please.
- You are horned up.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.222
You have half a fucking chub right now!

26:53.280 --> 26:56.340
- Take your hands away. I saw the boner.
- I'm not doing it.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.820
Move your fucking hands.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.700
- Fine! You wanna see it?
- Yeah.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.260
Feast your eyes.

27:01.360 --> 27:05.300
I'm gonna go poop out these drugs.
You're gonna go jerk off these thoughts.

27:05.400 --> 27:09.340
If we both still wanna talk about this
afterwards, we can. But not until then.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.191
Dave Skylark never backs down
from a jerk-off.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.660
In three days...

27:16.760 --> 27:18.780
you will fly from New York to Beijing...

27:18.880 --> 27:21.420
where you will transfer
to a commercial airline...

27:21.520 --> 27:23.580
that takes you directly to Pyongyang.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.700
I'm sorry,
this is completely unrelated, but...

27:26.800 --> 27:28.664
what happened to your glasses?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.460
- I got LASIK.
- Between the time I saw you and now?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.420
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.860
Now, our intelligence suggests
that you will be taken here...

27:39.960 --> 27:42.700
to Kim Jong-un's personal compound.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.380
So preceding the interview...

27:44.480 --> 27:46.780
you are going to shake Kim's hand...

27:46.880 --> 27:49.780
administering a fatal dose of poison...

27:49.880 --> 27:53.940
with this: a transdermal,
time-delayed ricin strip.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.540
When you shake his hand...

27:55.640 --> 27:58.620
the poison will be absorbed
into his skin...

27:58.720 --> 28:01.700
where it metabolizes
for a 12-hour period.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.940
Nobody will have any idea
you two were involved.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.500
No one will know?

28:06.600 --> 28:10.740
The United States must maintain total
and complete deniability.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.180
- Total deniability?
- Obviously.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.500
What did you picture?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.900
I walk in there like a
fucking gangster...

28:17.000 --> 28:20.300
and blow his little fucking
ass away on television.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.900
This is a major television event.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.183
You don't wanna blow it
with an off-screen death.

28:26.960 --> 28:31.020
Okay? Look, in porno,
we call this the money shot.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.660
You don't have a bunch
of dudes going at it.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.540
Then, right before they finish,
you cut to black and say:

28:36.640 --> 28:40.020
"Oh, don't worry, 12 hours later,
they came all over each other."

28:40.120 --> 28:43.340
No! You want them all over, close-up.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.940
All over his face.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.744
The end!

28:49.680 --> 28:52.100
- Bam!
- What kind of porn are you watching?

28:52.200 --> 28:54.820
What happens
when his guards start firing at you...

28:54.920 --> 28:57.220
for killing their leader
in front of them?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.180
- Good question.
- My bulletproof vest...

28:59.280 --> 29:01.220
No, you don't have a bulletproof vest.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.820
- You don't have one.
- I will dodge those bullets.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.020
What happens
after you escape the compound?

29:06.120 --> 29:08.140
I look back over my shoulder,
I see Aaron.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.820
I grab him by the hand.
We run out into the woods.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.780
Perhaps there's a secret tunnel there.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.180
We exit said tunnel.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.340
At a designated spot...

29:17.440 --> 29:19.860
SEAL Team 6 swoops in...

29:19.960 --> 29:22.580
puts us on one
of those inflatable motorboats.

29:22.680 --> 29:26.220
We hit the water.
We're out of there, on our way to you.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.700
If you tried to do this,
what would kill you first?

29:28.800 --> 29:31.300
- Subfreezing temperatures.
- I don't like the cold.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.060
- Okay, we wear...
- Starvation. Starve to death.

29:34.160 --> 29:37.900
You're telling me the CIA doesn't have
North Face jackets and Pirate Booty?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.540
Cap'n Crunch?

29:39.640 --> 29:42.980
- What about Siberian tigers?
- What?

29:43.080 --> 29:45.820
You're not going to shoot him.
Not going to be a bulletproof vest.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.180
And nobody is going to know
that you had anything to do with this.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.060
That's it. That's the plan.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.340
- Period.
- Okay.

29:52.440 --> 29:56.020
Two years later, I come out
with my best-selling tell-all:

29:56.120 --> 29:57.460
An Unexpected Journey:

29:57.560 --> 30:00.580
Dave Skylark's Adventures
in North Korea.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.220
You can't write a tell-all.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.860
We were in an oddly shaped gray room
at the CIA Headquarters.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.420
- The titillating Agent Lacey...
- Stop doing that.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.900
- Why?
- There's no tell-all.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.340
"There's no tell-all," Agent Lacey said.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.100
She looked at him.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.060
She trembled with rage.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.500
- Or was it passion?
- Stop it.

30:18.600 --> 30:22.227
I just want everybody to know
that I know what you did to me.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.500
- What?
- With the glasses. Honeycombed me.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.380
- What does that mean?
- You honeypotted him.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.100
- It's "honeypot."
- You honeypotted me.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.580
- You honeypotted him.
- No, I didn't.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.660
He said a lot of stupid shit in the last
10 minutes, but you did honeypot him.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.140
I bet you got him in here as a honeydick,
in case I'm gay. But I'm not.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.180
But if I was, I would've seen him
coming a mile away.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.540
- You honeydicking?
- Look.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.140
She's not honeypotting you.
I'm not honeydicking him.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.740
It's very offensive.
If you think about it...

30:46.840 --> 30:49.820
you're saying because I'm a girl
and because I'm attractive...

30:49.920 --> 30:53.020
my only use for this agency
would be to manipulate men.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.740
I think it's offensive too.
That's what I said to Aaron.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.900
I Said, "That bitch is blind as a bat."

30:58.000 --> 31:00.100
Could we please move on?

31:00.200 --> 31:02.100
We have a dictator to kill.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.740
When handling the ricin strip,
operate with extreme caution.

31:06.840 --> 31:09.700
Even momentary flesh contact
with the exposed strip is fatal.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.940
The poison will lay
dormant for 12 hours.

31:13.040 --> 31:17.460
After it passes the blood-brain barrier,
your heart rate would shoot up to 160.

31:17.560 --> 31:21.660
Your body will strain to reject the poison
by sweating, defecating, vomiting.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.591
Within minutes, you will be dead.
Got it?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.500
Aaron peels off the film marked "A"...

31:29.600 --> 31:32.180
exposing the adhesive coating.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.580
- He applies the strip to Dave's palm.
- Okay.

31:35.680 --> 31:39.300
Aaron will then remove the film
marked "B," exposing the ricin.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.700
- Clear. Okay.
- Okay, clear. Okay.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.380
Dave needs to appear casual
as he is transferred from his room...

31:45.480 --> 31:47.340
to the broadcast facility.

31:47.440 --> 31:51.620
It is critical that he keeps
his hand open and touches...

31:51.720 --> 31:53.100
nothing.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.950
Dave Skylark.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.820
Mr. Kim, just shaking hands.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.220
Hi.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.900
Nice to meet you.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.100
Dave will bow to Kim,
then shake his hand...

32:05.200 --> 32:09.540
immediately disposing of the strip
in his jacket pocket, which will be lined...

32:09.640 --> 32:13.267
with an absorbing agent
that denatures the poison.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.900
Oh, no.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.780
Aaron! Aaron!

32:36.880 --> 32:39.500
- Agent Lacey! What's this mean?!
- You're dead.

32:39.600 --> 32:43.420
All right, Mr. Skylark, so you'll place
the ricin case in this pouch.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.420
It will magnetically seal.
And then, you're good to go.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.900
So you want me to carry this bag?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.180
This is the bag.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.700
This is a douche bag.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.060
The watches conceal an array
of tactical functions.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.980
It's how you stay in contact with me
in the command center.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.460
Aaron to Dave.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.460
Radio communication
is done using call signs.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.060
- Cool.
- Dave, you are Dung Beetle.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.180
- And, Aaron, you are Aardvark.
- What?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.580
- I can't carry this thing!
- What do you mean?

33:08.680 --> 33:12.380
Aerodynamics are all off.
It's hitting my leg. It's, like, bulky.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.740
Remember, gentlemen:

33:13.840 --> 33:18.980
You are entering into the most dangerous
and unpredictable country on earth.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.540
Kim Jong-un is a master manipulator.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.220
His people revere him as a god.

33:25.320 --> 33:30.260
They'll believe anything he tells them,
including that he can speak to dolphins...

33:30.360 --> 33:32.269
or he doesn't urinate and defecate.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.980
My man doesn't pee or poo?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.340
He does. He lies to his people
and they believe him.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.740
Everybody pees and poos.
Where would it go? He'd explode.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.829
But he does talk to dolphins.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.660
All right, how do I look?
Fucking awesome?

34:07.760 --> 34:10.226
Yeah, actually,
this is really, really nice...

34:12.159 --> 34:14.179
- What the fuck is this?
- It's my bag.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.860
Wonderful. That's not the bag
the CIA gave you.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.739
- Oh, that bag?
- Yes, that bag.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.060
That bag was fugly with a capital "fug"!

34:21.159 --> 34:24.620
It was designed to conceal poison
that we're gonna smuggle in.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.380
Kim is a superfan.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.139
He knows I take fashion risks.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.340
I show up with that other bag,
Kim's gonna be like:

34:30.440 --> 34:33.179
"Aw, no. You got ugly bag?

34:33.280 --> 34:36.620
You no Skylark. You secret agent.
Terminate him."

34:36.719 --> 34:41.500
- Where's the fucking poison strip?!
- I put the strip in a pack of gum.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.820
- They'll never find it.
- I am not cool with this.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.420
- It's showtime.
- "Showtime"? It's not showtime.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.580
- Dave Skylark Tonight!
- What are you doing? Stop walking.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.060
- Hello!
- Stop walking.

34:51.159 --> 34:52.580
We are going to North Korea.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.620
Skylark, which side
of President Kim's ass you gonna kiss?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.420
Not gonna kiss him,
but let's just say...

34:57.520 --> 34:59.860
I might give him something special
with my hand.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.140
You gonna jerk him off?

35:01.240 --> 35:03.860
- What? No, that's a double entendre!
- Shut the fuck up!

35:03.960 --> 35:07.140
- I'm foreshadowing!
- Just shut up! Get in the fucking car!

35:07.240 --> 35:08.780
Shut up! Shut up!

35:08.880 --> 35:11.904
Why would you say that?
Why would you say that?

35:17.040 --> 35:19.188
All right. Here we go.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.340
What's that noise?

35:22.440 --> 35:24.588
- I don't know. Yeah.
- Do you hear that?

35:36.880 --> 35:38.141
This is crazy.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.100
Hello, North Korea!

35:42.200 --> 35:43.380
Crazy.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.106
- Okay, okay.
- North side!

35:46.720 --> 35:50.300
Okay, hi. Sorry about what he's doing.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.706
Hello.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.863
I like your style.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.100
Good to see you again. How are you?

35:58.200 --> 35:59.660
- Hi.
- Hello.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.100
- Hello.
- This is great.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.620
Dave, this is Sook-yin Park.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.420
- Sook? The Sook?
- Yes. Yes.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.464
- That you won't stop talking about?
- That's not true.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.068
We are different people.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.747
We speak different languages.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.420
We have different faces.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.180
But inside...

36:36.280 --> 36:38.109
we are same-same.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.180
Same-same.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.900
But different.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.704
But still same.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.346
Thank you.

36:48.920 --> 36:53.264
You know, I'm very, very interested
in the history of your young nation.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.300
I hear that absolutely everyone here
is starving to death.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.831
No.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.300
It's quite all right.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.860
- This is a common misconception.
- Oh, okay.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.505
See for yourself.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.660
It's a grocery store! Looks like
the Whole Foods near my place.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.060
Yep. Guess no one's hungry here
after all.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.420
We have an abundance of food here.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.987
And speak of the devil,
look at that fat kid.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.068
Hi, little fatty. Hi.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.660
We have many fat children
in North Korea.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.020
The Supreme Leader believes
it is a hallmark...

37:30.120 --> 37:32.500
of prosperity and self-sufficiency.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.900
I don't know about all that,
but this one is one that I heard.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.660
I heard he doesn't pee or poo.

37:37.760 --> 37:41.340
He works so hard,
he burns the energy from inside.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.620
My man doesn't have to take a poo?

37:43.720 --> 37:47.100
- Does he have a butthole?
- He does not have a butthole.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.223
He has no need for one.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.865
- Damn, son.
- Damn.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.705
Right this way.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.423
I get it. Fucking stop it.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.100
These are Officers Koh and Yu.

38:57.200 --> 39:00.940
They are the heads of our
Supreme Leader's personal security.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.300
They have been with him
since he was a boy.

39:03.400 --> 39:07.869
They will search you one last time before
entering our Supreme Leader's home.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.667
Just a Gucci bag.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.146
What's this?

39:25.240 --> 39:27.342
Gum. That is gum.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.300
- You fucking tried it.
- Okay.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.980
- This gum has no flavor.
- If you don't like it, spit it out.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.387
Spit it out. We wouldn't be insulted.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.746
- Your gum taste like shit.
- Okay.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.822
You may now enter
the Supreme Leader's home.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.260
- This room for Mr. Skylark.
- Cool.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.507
Thanks.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.260
This room for Mr. Rapaport.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.860
Ooh, lovely. Thank you.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.540
- Cute.
- Quaint.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.660
I'm tired. How are you feeling?

40:08.760 --> 40:10.589
- We go now.
- Okay.

40:11.760 --> 40:15.140
Dude, what the fuck? Hey, you know,
how's your tummy feeling?

40:15.240 --> 40:17.069
- Have some TUMS.
- Have some tea.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.020
Fuck.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.060
They could be recording?

40:21.160 --> 40:22.944
- Oh, the thing.
- The thing. Okay.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.500
- Lovely room. Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.860
- I'm gonna go take a shower now.
- Okay.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.300
- I'll take one with you.
- Why with me?

40:31.400 --> 40:32.501
Fake conversation.

40:34.920 --> 40:38.308
- What the fuck, dude?
- Oh, my God.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.020
He ate it. He fucking ate it.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.300
- You're not supposed to touch it.
- And he ate it.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.260
- Chewing. Chewing it!
- Shit! Fuck.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.820
Shit! He's gonna die.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.180
Look, look, look.

40:48.280 --> 40:52.700
He's probably Kim's triggerman, okay?
He's probably killed, like, tons of people.

40:52.800 --> 40:56.060
He's probably worse than Kim.
And we're okay with killing Kim.

40:56.160 --> 41:00.740
How the fuck are we gonna do that?
We don't have any poison anymore!

41:00.840 --> 41:02.460
Well, what happened to it?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.220
- Somebody ate it.
- Someone ate it?

41:04.320 --> 41:06.660
- Why the fuck did you switch bags?
- Yeah, Dave.

41:06.760 --> 41:07.860
All right, all right!

41:07.960 --> 41:10.100
I shouldn't have
switched the bags. Sorry.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.820
Listen, just sit tight.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.300
I am going to contact you.
Do not fall asleep.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.220
I'll figure out a way to fix this.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.780
- Thanks. Why'd you tell her?
- It's the truth.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.060
- Why'd you tell her that he ate it?
- He did!

41:22.160 --> 41:25.500
Dude. That was a cock block.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.021
Get me Major Franks
at the Osan Air Force Base.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.628
ETA to launch zone: 20 minutes.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.340
We have a bird en route.

42:01.440 --> 42:05.460
It will be within range of you
in 15 minutes. Aardvark:

42:05.560 --> 42:09.220
Your watch will transmit
the coordinates to guide in the package.

42:09.320 --> 42:13.140
Get outside to a place with no tree cover
where you can't be detected.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.180
- Okay?
- What...?

42:15.280 --> 42:17.300
- Why do I have to do it?
- Why you?

42:17.400 --> 42:21.500
If Dung Beetle gets caught or killed,
then we don't have a mission anymore.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.380
- I could get caught or killed?
- Hey!

42:23.480 --> 42:26.300
Put on your darkest clothes
and get outside now.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.106
Make sure you are 20 yards
away from the building.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.149
Approaching launch zone.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.220
- You ready?
- I think so.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.549
A little nervous, but I'm feeling okay.
I think I can do it.

42:49.240 --> 42:51.780
- What are you doing?
- I'll cherish all our memories.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.420
- Don't do this.
- What?

42:53.520 --> 42:56.260
Talk to me like I'm about to die, okay?
I'll be fine!

42:56.360 --> 42:58.180
I'm trying to psych myself up here.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.580
I will love your mother
like she was mine.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.020
- Just shut up.
- Okay.

43:06.680 --> 43:09.740
- It's really scary out there.
- Yeah, super-duper scary.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.820
- Be careful.
- Okay, good. You got me?

43:11.920 --> 43:13.140
- I got you.
- Okay.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.911
- I will not drop you. I got you...
- Don't drop me.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.510
Aardvark, are you all right?

43:22.200 --> 43:23.790
I'm fine. Shut the fuck up.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.220
Aardvark is hot.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.071
I repeat: Aardvark is H-O-T. Hot.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.020
- This is so scary.
- Aardvark:

43:43.120 --> 43:47.100
You're being extremely brave.
Everybody here is very proud of you.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.500
- My tummy's all scraped up and wet.
- Aardvark:

43:49.600 --> 43:51.460
I'll rub your tummy when you get back.

43:51.560 --> 43:55.300
Just a few more feet. Okay?
Just five to 10 more feet.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.500
I gotta keep going?

43:56.600 --> 43:58.702
I don't wanna keep going. Fuck.

43:59.480 --> 44:04.222
Package will deploy
in three, two, one. Boom.

44:05.240 --> 44:08.469
Package is inbound.
Arrival time: two minutes.

44:10.480 --> 44:13.823
Just five more feet. Five more feet
and you're on your mark.

44:14.480 --> 44:17.390
Hey, hey. Hey. Don't move.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.185
I think I see something.

44:20.440 --> 44:23.300
- There's something out there.
- What do you mean?

44:23.400 --> 44:25.070
What is it? Can you zoom in?

44:25.600 --> 44:26.700
What do I do?

44:26.800 --> 44:28.540
Comm One, are you seeing this?

44:28.640 --> 44:30.660
Zoom in on that thing. What is that?

44:30.760 --> 44:33.100
There's something crawling
towards Aardvark.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.180
What the fuck? What is it? Talk to me.

44:35.280 --> 44:38.260
I'm seeing four legs
connected to one body.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.580
What the fuck are you seeing?

44:40.680 --> 44:43.380
- Dog? Big dog?
- A big dog?

44:43.480 --> 44:46.820
It's like Clifford size. We're talking
Falkor in The Neverending Story.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.421
It's like a dragon dog.
This is like a dragon dog.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.940
- Is that a fucking...?
- Guys?

44:52.040 --> 44:54.900
- What am I looking for? I don't...
- It's like a big dog.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.180
It's orange, got stripes.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.189
It's like a big, orange, stripy dog.

45:05.880 --> 45:06.980
There's a tiger.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.420
It's a fucking tiger!

45:08.520 --> 45:09.820
It's a fucking tiger.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.580
Yes. A tiger.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.940
- You led my friend into a tiger patch?!
- I told you there were tigers.

45:16.040 --> 45:18.060
Guys, I'm very unhappy right now.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.300
It's really dark.
He probably doesn't see you.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.104
Oh, it fucking sees me.

45:22.800 --> 45:25.420
- It has night vision.
- They have night vision?

45:25.520 --> 45:27.380
That tiger has night-vision goggles?!

45:27.480 --> 45:30.260
It doesn't have night-vision goggles.
It naturally has night...

45:30.360 --> 45:33.509
- What is this, some futuristic nightmare?
- Just keep the line clear.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.300
Aardvark is in trouble.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.900
What do I do? What do I do?

45:37.000 --> 45:38.580
Talk to me. Talk to me.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.180
You're gonna have to fight that tiger.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.300
No! Do not! Do not fight the tiger!

45:43.400 --> 45:45.700
Do not be a gentleman.
Go right for the balls!

45:45.800 --> 45:48.820
- I don't see its balls.
- Do not fight the tiger. You will lose.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.140
If that's a girl tiger,
you gotta cunt-punt that bitch!

45:51.240 --> 45:53.420
- Dave, shut the fuck up!
- Cunt-punt that bitch!

45:53.520 --> 45:57.341
You know that's a stupid idea.
Please, don't try to fight the tiger.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.100
- I'm gonna make a run for it.
- Do not run for it!

46:02.200 --> 46:04.587
- You will die!
- It's coming.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.420
You go, go, go, buddy!

46:07.520 --> 46:09.907
Look out, it's coming after you!

46:22.600 --> 46:24.500
- Oh, God. I'm alive!
- Aaron.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.986
I'm alive!

46:26.600 --> 46:29.060
Are you in the tiger?
Are you inside the tiger?

46:29.160 --> 46:31.388
Are you okay? Do you have the package?

46:32.400 --> 46:33.940
This is Aardvark.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.860
The package killed the tiger.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.940
Fantastic.
You have to secure the package.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.585
Secure the package.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.820
He's got the package.
He has the package.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.300
What do I do with it?

46:50.400 --> 46:52.540
There are people coming.
You have to act now.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.660
Secure the package.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.420
- What do I do with it?
- They're coming towards you.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.620
You gotta hide that little missile.

46:58.720 --> 47:01.027
I have to hide it somewhere? Where?

47:03.040 --> 47:05.905
What do I do with it?
What do I do with it?

47:08.720 --> 47:10.549
What if you hide it in your butt?

47:12.760 --> 47:14.580
I don't wanna stick it in my ass.

47:14.680 --> 47:16.300
You gotta put it in your butt.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.500
Comm One, please tell me
I don't have to stick this in my ass.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.900
Okay. Just give us one second
to come up with a better plan.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.780
- Isn't there anywhere else?
- I think he should put it in his asshole.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.340
We don't have a better plan.
Stick it in your ass.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.780
No! No!

47:30.880 --> 47:32.220
No!

47:32.320 --> 47:33.540
I've never done that!

47:33.640 --> 47:35.700
I've been there before. It looks huge.

47:35.800 --> 47:39.300
- That tiger blood will lubricate it.
- This will mess up my asshole!

47:39.400 --> 47:41.460
Aardvark, there are people there.

47:41.560 --> 47:44.060
They are closing in on you.
They have guns.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.500
You need to secure the payload.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.820
- Secure it in your ass.
- Stick it in your butt.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.900
- Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine.
- I'm there with you, bro.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.140
Just listen to the soothing tones
of my voice. Just breathe.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.740
- Oh, it's cold!
- Just let everything go loose.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.102
- I don't like it!
- The tip is...

48:00.520 --> 48:03.300
It's the worst part. Trust me on this.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.661
Inhale as you do it.

48:07.560 --> 48:10.948
- The tip of the package is secure.
- Comm One, that thing is in his butt!

48:13.080 --> 48:16.423
You are almost in the end zone,
Aardvark. Just take it home.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.100
The package is secure.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.460
You are a hero.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.220
You are a goddamn hero.

48:29.320 --> 48:32.264
All right, they're coming in.
I gotta go. Over and out.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.503
Oh, shit. Hi!
Hi, don't shoot me! Oh, God!

48:44.640 --> 48:47.346
Stop it! Don't hurt me, please!

48:49.360 --> 48:51.349
See? There's nothing in here!

48:52.320 --> 48:53.467
What?

48:54.240 --> 48:55.910
Oh, God. No!

48:57.480 --> 48:59.540
Come on! What the fuck?!

48:59.640 --> 49:01.540
Why?! Why'd you do that?!

49:01.640 --> 49:02.740
Why'd you do that?!

49:02.840 --> 49:04.180
Is this what you want?!

49:04.280 --> 49:05.900
There! You like it?!

49:06.000 --> 49:07.620
You like it?!

49:07.720 --> 49:10.100
It's all yours, fuckers!

49:10.200 --> 49:12.029
Stay in the room, American.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.180
Hey.

49:21.280 --> 49:24.140
- Did they look in your butt?
- No, they didn't look!

49:24.240 --> 49:25.865
- It's still in there?
- Yes!

49:26.680 --> 49:29.060
- Must be deep.
- It is.

49:29.160 --> 49:32.548
- Get it out! I'm hereto help.
- I'm gonna fucking get it out.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.020
Hey, how'd it go?

49:53.120 --> 49:56.303
- One ricin strip with your name on it.
- Got it.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.580
- All right. See? Not so bad.
- Yeah, not so bad.

50:00.680 --> 50:02.020
- What?
- Yeah.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.220
- That?
- This.

50:03.320 --> 50:04.740
- In your bu...?
- Asshole.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.500
- No!
- Yes!

50:06.600 --> 50:08.980
- I was picturing like this big.
- That I could live with.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.220
Soon as you get home,
see a proctologist.

50:11.320 --> 50:14.390
- I'm afraid to look.
- You got fucked by RoboCop, dude.

50:17.560 --> 50:18.860
Who is it?

50:18.960 --> 50:20.710
It is Kim Jong-un.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.581
What?

50:23.320 --> 50:25.300
Kim Jong what?

50:25.400 --> 50:28.860
I am the Supreme Leader of North Korea.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.940
- What? What the fuck?
- It's him.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.460
It's him. What is he doing here?
What the fuck?

50:33.560 --> 50:35.220
Hide it. Put it back up.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.780
No! I'm not putting it back up.
I'll hide it in my room. Go say hi.

50:38.880 --> 50:42.100
- What do I do? Put it on right now?
- No, then he'll die when we're still here.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.580
- Just put it in your pocket.
- Okay, fine.

50:44.680 --> 50:46.540
- Come with me.
- No, I gotta hide this.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.580
- Aaron. Just come with me.
- No. No.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.270
Aaron. Aaron.

50:58.560 --> 50:59.866
Hi.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.071
Good morning, Dave.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.340
Good morning. Hi.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.951
Dave Skylark.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.146
It's crazy.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.500
- Oh, I have a gift for you. Yeah.
- Oh, really?

51:14.920 --> 51:16.181
This.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.220
- Oh, this is me.
- It's you.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.980
Oh, that's great.
I always wanted one of these.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.180
A bust.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.820
Dave Skylark.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.300
- Hey! Thank you.
- You like that?

51:27.400 --> 51:28.780
So you really like the show?

51:28.880 --> 51:31.180
I might not show it,
but I'm freaking out.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.820
You're like a superfan.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.940
- I really am.
- Yeah!

51:35.040 --> 51:36.740
That's so cool.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.068
Don't say something stupid, Kim.

51:40.840 --> 51:45.060
Okay, so I thought
you might enjoy breakfast...

51:45.160 --> 51:46.830
and a tour of my home.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.422
I'd absolutely love to.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.380
You know, I have to admit,
before I came here...

51:53.480 --> 51:55.860
I thought this place
was gonna be a dump.

51:55.960 --> 51:59.620
Of course. For decades
you've heard the false rumors:

51:59.720 --> 52:03.860
"North Korea is a failed state.
We can't feed our people."

52:03.960 --> 52:05.500
It's all propaganda.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.660
I see. Well, yeah, I mean...

52:07.760 --> 52:11.420
I did see a fat kid
and a really nice-looking grocery store.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.580
Oh, we have beautiful grocery stores
here in North Korea.

52:14.680 --> 52:18.940
One of my favorite things to do
is just strolling up and down the aisles...

52:19.040 --> 52:21.820
to see the beautiful fruits
of my country's land.

52:21.920 --> 52:25.820
I can believe that. It looks like you hit
the grocery store pretty often.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.140
Screw you, Dave.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.627
- Hey, you want to see something cool?
- Yeah.

52:40.600 --> 52:43.100
Holy fuck-a-moley!

52:43.200 --> 52:44.860
Is that real?

52:44.960 --> 52:47.580
It was a gift to my grandfather
from Stalin.

52:47.680 --> 52:51.341
In my country,
it's pronounced "Stallone."

52:52.400 --> 52:54.184
You're so funny, Dave.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.980
Right. Well, can we look inside?

52:58.080 --> 53:00.308
Fuck, yeah, we can. Come on.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.100
This is so cool!

53:03.200 --> 53:05.541
- A tank!
- Yeah, a tank.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.230
Is it still live?

53:08.760 --> 53:11.864
I don't know. Maybe we should find out.

53:13.120 --> 53:17.270
- Look. You have a sound system in here?
- Oh, no, no, no. Don't touch.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.066
Katy Perry?

53:24.680 --> 53:26.700
My wife must have put that in there.

53:26.800 --> 53:30.260
- I've never heard this before in my life.
- I love Katy Perry!

53:30.360 --> 53:33.860
Baby, you're a firework

53:33.960 --> 53:37.580
Come on, show them what you're worth

53:37.680 --> 53:39.780
I love... I listen to this all the time.

53:39.880 --> 53:42.340
- Really?
- I love her!

53:42.440 --> 53:45.980
You know why I really like her?
She has such a strong message...

53:46.080 --> 53:49.700
for young women and girls
across the planet.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.020
It's so empowering.

53:52.120 --> 53:53.420
Yeah.

53:53.520 --> 53:57.420
You know, Dave,
sometimes I feel like a plastic bag.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.031
Drifting through the wind?

54:00.560 --> 54:02.549
Wanting to start again.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.060
As you shoot across

54:06.160 --> 54:07.989
The sky-sky-sky

54:09.760 --> 54:12.020
- Good times. Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:12.120 --> 54:17.420
Dave, do you think that margaritas
are gay because they are so sweet?

54:17.520 --> 54:19.860
Did someone tell you
that margaritas are gay?

54:19.960 --> 54:22.580
No, it's just a question I have.

54:22.680 --> 54:25.860
If liking Katy Perry
and drinking margaritas is gay...

54:25.960 --> 54:27.780
then who wants to be straight?

54:27.880 --> 54:29.580
- Not me.
- Boring!

54:29.680 --> 54:31.420
Margaritas are great.

54:31.520 --> 54:34.829
And whoever planted
that in your head is crazy.

54:35.760 --> 54:37.430
Let me ask you something.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.464
Does this thing still run?

54:59.520 --> 55:02.020
Oh, man, this is great!

55:02.120 --> 55:03.780
Can we fire the gun?

55:03.880 --> 55:05.940
Think I'd tease you
and not take you all the way?

55:06.040 --> 55:07.540
- Really?!
- Close that shit.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.460
- Closing the hatch!
- Okay.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.469
Boom, boom, boom!

55:15.600 --> 55:17.270
Oh, shit!

55:17.720 --> 55:19.390
Fuck you, tree!

55:20.520 --> 55:24.940
The control room will be fully staffed
to insure an uninterrupted transmission.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.180
All right.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.100
This is the kill switch.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.220
During the interview,
if any parameters are violated...

55:31.320 --> 55:33.380
I will use it and cut the signal.

55:33.480 --> 55:38.380
- We're gonna stick with the program.
- I will be in charge of this transmission.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.060
Dave and the show itself
are dependent on me...

55:41.160 --> 55:43.380
when it comes to how we shoot the show.

55:43.480 --> 55:47.027
I know. I've watched every
episode in preparation.

55:48.040 --> 55:51.660
I particularly enjoyed the
Miley Cyrus camel toe episode.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.860
The camel toe episode. That was good.

55:53.960 --> 55:56.020
I've never heard this expression before.

55:56.120 --> 56:00.380
But after seeing it, it is a perfect
representation of her vagina.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.700
It is. It looked exactly
like that. Yeah.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.580
- It's very deep.
- Very deep.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.100
Quite a moose knuckle.

56:06.200 --> 56:09.340
You Americans are so creative
with your sexual innuendos.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.780
- We do it very well.
- Many animal references.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.027
Oh, yes, tons.

56:20.160 --> 56:23.420
Please, take this printed copy
of the questions.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.700
It's crucial Dave review them.

56:25.800 --> 56:29.540
Officers Koh and Yu will now
take you to your room for lunch.

56:29.640 --> 56:31.940
Come, American. Time to get even fatter.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.869
Great. Thanks, guys.

56:39.880 --> 56:42.347
Making you my little Korean bitch!

56:43.200 --> 56:45.380
What are you gonna do,
drop nukes on L.A.?

56:45.480 --> 56:48.823
- Nuke your mama!
- I bet they can't even make it to Australia!

56:50.760 --> 56:52.066
Face!

56:55.040 --> 56:56.220
Man...

56:56.320 --> 56:58.260
this is so nice.

56:58.360 --> 57:01.420
Let me ask you something.
Don't take this the wrong way.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.463
You can ask me anything, Dave.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.460
Do you pee and poo?

57:06.560 --> 57:08.469
You've heard the stories, huh?

57:09.480 --> 57:12.460
- Yes, I pee and poo.
- So you have a butthole?

57:12.560 --> 57:15.420
I've got a butthole,
and it's working overtime.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.951
You are awesome.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.260
You know, this is so weird.

57:19.360 --> 57:22.300
You are, like, the coolest guy.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.707
But a lot of people say...

57:25.400 --> 57:27.025
that you're batshit crazy.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.064
They're not wrong.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.300
I'm 31 years old.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.550
The fact that I am running
a country is batshit crazy.

57:37.960 --> 57:41.780
What am I to do
when 24 million people...

57:41.880 --> 57:45.268
look to me as their leader, their god?

57:45.960 --> 57:51.385
What am I to do when my father's
dying wish was for me to carry his torch?

57:54.640 --> 57:57.100
Know what my father said
to me on his deathbed?

57:57.200 --> 57:58.860
What did he say, Dave?

57:58.960 --> 58:02.701
"I'm disappointed because you haven't
done enough with your life."

58:03.120 --> 58:05.220
That is fucked up.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.820
Yeah, tell me about it.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.181
Jordan!

58:11.480 --> 58:13.180
They call me incompetent.

58:13.280 --> 58:16.220
That's what they said about me
when I scored this interview!

58:16.320 --> 58:19.180
- No way!
- They said, "Dave Skylark is stupid...

58:19.280 --> 58:20.500
and incompetent."

58:20.600 --> 58:23.940
You're handsome, competent, suave.
How dare they?

58:24.040 --> 58:27.826
I pretend like their insults
don't get to me.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.980
But they do.

58:30.080 --> 58:33.740
You know what's more destructive
than a nuclear bomb?

58:33.840 --> 58:35.510
Words.

58:35.880 --> 58:39.580
And the people are jealous of men
like you and me.

58:39.680 --> 58:43.705
It's as though they despise us
because they are not us.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.910
Hate us because they ain't us.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.388
Exactly. They hate us
because they ain't us.

58:53.120 --> 58:56.700
- That's a great saying, okay?
- Hate us because they ain't us!

58:56.800 --> 58:59.506
They hate us because they ain't us!

59:00.240 --> 59:02.780
Kim! You got a break!

59:02.880 --> 59:04.186
Alley-oop!

59:06.520 --> 59:08.420
That's all right. That's all right.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.031
Oh, my ankles.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.544
- Okay.
- Hey, Kim.

59:14.120 --> 59:15.870
Let me ask you something.

59:19.560 --> 59:23.631
Was your father the one
who said that margaritas are gay?

59:24.080 --> 59:28.708
He said that my brothers and I
were all too feminine.

59:29.360 --> 59:33.351
That our luxurious lifestyles
turned us into homosexuals.

59:36.400 --> 59:39.300
I don't have to worry
about that anymore.

59:39.400 --> 59:42.822
Because guess what I get tons of?

59:45.960 --> 59:49.109
- Pussy.
- Oh, my God.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.940
Hey.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.906
Dude, you just spent the fucking day
with Kim Jong-un. What happened?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.900
It was amazing.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.660
- It was amazing?
- Yeah.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.180
It was one of the best days of my life.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.220
- What?
- We smoked joints...

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.900
played basketball...

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.500
fucked chicks.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.260
We had the best margaritas.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.260
Did you say you fucked chicks?

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.740
Oh, my God. Kim Jong is an animal!

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.060
You know you have to kill
this guy tomorrow.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.580
I've been thinking a little bit
about the mission.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.820
Okay.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.020
America, you know...

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.660
always putting its nose in things
and screwing them up.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.900
The truth is, Kim is a master
at manipulating the media.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.980
- Yeah?
- You're the media.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.784
You get what's happening here?

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.900
Maybe the media's manipulating you.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.580
What the fuck does that even mean?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.700
I'm the only one
who's spent real time with him.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.620
Spent face-to-face time! Dick-to-dick!

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.260
It's just, man, I can sympathize with
people that get dumped on by the media.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.460
- And it sucks.
- You know what else fucking sucks?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.700
Concentration camps, famine,
firing squads...

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.982
- I didn't see any here. Have you?
- No...

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.420
Your attendance is required in
the banquet room of the Eternal Leader.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.340
- Hey, how you doing?
- Yeah, seriously. You look fantastic.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.780
Your obsession with my well-being is
only making me more suspicious of you.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.180
Don't be suspicious.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.620
- I want to know what your routine is.
- Do you take vitamins?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.140
- You're doing something right.
- You look good.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.742
Do not ask us any more question.
Meet us in the banquet hall.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.470
You see how big their guitars are
compared to their bodies?

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.260
I think it's funny.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.110
That is funny.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.426
Oh, no.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.625
It's happening.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.027
Dave.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.580
Dave.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.865
No.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.107
- Wait, what?
- Look at the fu...

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.867
They're good.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.830
Oh, shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, shit.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.426
Oh, my God.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.422
- What do we do?
- He's gonna poo.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.181
Oh, no.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.949
Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.950
It's happening.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.269
So gross.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.940
Oh, no, no, no.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.861
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.745
Oh, my God!

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.660
- It's okay, man.
- No.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.907
Come on, man.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.420
We just killed two innocent men.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.740
Look, first of all, it's not your fault
that those men died.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.989
Second, they had to go.
They knew we were up to something.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.420
- I'm out.
- What? You cannot pull out of this.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.180
- I'm pulling out.
- You're way too deep.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.300
- I'm pulling out.
- No. You are leaving it in.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.140
- I've been pulling out for years.
- You are not pulling out of this mission.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.820
That's the only reason we're here.
We are doing this!

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.860
Kim is not evil. He was just born
into a hard situation.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.950
You are fucking stupid,
and you are fucking ignorant.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.060
- Who you calling ign'ant?
- You, motherfucker.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.060
You're fucking arrogant!

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.620
Everything he's shown you is fake.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.620
He's shown you what you wanna see.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.620
He's fooled you, you fucking idiot!

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.940
God, look how ready you are
to betray me.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.580
This whole time, I thought
you were Samwise to my Frodo.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.660
But you're just Boromir.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.180
I don't know who that is.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.940
That's such a Boromir thing to say!

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.660
This is fucking done.
You are fucking done after this.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.980
Once you kill this motherfucker,
this shit's over.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.820
- You are going to kill him!
- You've turned me into a gun.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.380
And you're pointing me
at the one guy who gets me.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.344
Well, you know what, cowboy?

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.900
- A gun can't fire without no bullets.
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.183
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.820
Realize what you just did?

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.620
- I just saved a life, you murderer.
- You piece of...

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.860
Mr. Skylark.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.300
The Supreme Leader requests
your presence in Pyongyang for dinner.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.707
He will be at your door in 30 minutes.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.791
Hey, Dave. Thank you for being with me
in my time of sorrow.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.500
That was super gross and fucked up.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.065
Hi.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.700
Mr. Supreme Leader.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.026
I'm Aaron.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.860
- Aaron?
- Hello.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.020
We never got a chance
to formally meet, Mr. Great Leader.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.820
I just wanted to shake your hand.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.911
Well, any friend of Dave
is a friend of mine.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.740
No! Don't shake that hand.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.420
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?!

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.305
- Because Aaron's a Jew.
- Oh, gross.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.784
- Let's go, Supreme Leader.
- Okay. It was nice meeting you.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.100
Don't you know Jews are bad luck?

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.951
- Fuck you.
- Friends don't kill friends' friends.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.860
Okay. Okay.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.664
Oh, fuck.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.500
We need to review some new data...

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.820
the Leader wants included
in the interview.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.263
- Now's not really the best time.
- It will only take a moment.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.940
Yeah, okay.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.630
- Great.
- Thank you.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.824
Would you like to share a drink?

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.020
Raise your glasses. Koh and Yu!

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.747
Koh and Yu possessed
the finest trait men can have:

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.979
Loyalty.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.500
I know how you feel.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.544
My dog Digby died when I was a kid,
and I'm still fucked up about it.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.180
Loyalty is what made my father
and grandfather so successful.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:43.540
That's right. Hey, listen up. You.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.500
Without loyalty...

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.067
a country is a lawless jungle.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:53.660
Welcome to the jungle, baby.
Welcome to the jungle.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.779
On your... knees.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.580
How else can I prevail...

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.067
against so many enemies?

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.220
Defectors.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.180
South Korean capitalists.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.580
The people in this room...

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.540
who don't think
I can fill my father's shoes!

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.062
These bastards deserve no humanity!

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:21.426
To those who seek to undermine me,
at home and abroad...

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.220
I cannot respond with anything less...

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.866
than the totality of my strength!

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.180
If a billion people across the earth
and in my own country...

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:34.740
must be burned to prove it...

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.380
then my worthiness as a Kim...

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.662
will be demonstrated!

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.020
Hey, Kim, I gotta go outside.
Is that okay?

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.820
I'm just feeling...

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.351
Too much...

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.625
soju, whatever.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.466
Okay.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.660
I'll be back.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.820
So how'd you wind up
as one of the heads...

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.784
of a dictatorship?

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.420
One day, officials came to my classroom
in search of a young woman...

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.941
to serve on
the Kim family personal staff.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.463
They selected me.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.380
Over the years...

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.620
I grew close with Kim Jong-un.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.983
When he rose to power,
he took me with him.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.940
And here I am.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.666
Kind of have a guy like that
in my life too.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.780
You've been with Dave a long time.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.540
He's a hard guy to leave.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.820
You like the money
and can't say no to Dave.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.580
No.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.940
Yes! I know you.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.980
You're fucking awesome.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.940
- No, I don't understand you.
- You know, it's a little bit weird.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.667
Do you have a boyfriend?
Is that too forward of me to ask?

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.544
What are you looking at?

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.540
I should leave.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.787
Why?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.300
I'm concerned my feelings
of attraction for you...

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.260
will cause me to make mistakes.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.340
Your feelings of attraction for me?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.905
Fuck this!

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.940
Ever since I saw you,
this is all I've been thinking about.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.505
Me too!

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.586
Fake.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.911
Fake carrots.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.946
Fake fruit!

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.541
Fake!

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.306
Fake!

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.984
Fake grapefruits!

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.540
Fake!

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.709
Liar!

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.503
You liar!

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.070
Why aren't I naked yet?

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.700
Yeah!

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.540
You're hairy! You so hairy like a bear!

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.340
You're fucking sexy. Yeah.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.300
- Your nipples are so pink!
- Yes, they are.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.865
I love it!

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.820
No! Whoa! No!

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.620
- No hands.
- No hands?

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.471
I'm not into handsy shit.
That's how I like it.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.067
- Just take it off!
- Okay.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.340
- You said no hands!
- You hit me with your hand!

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.940
How do I get it off?!

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.220
Use your big, fat American teeth.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.180
Okay! I will!

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.500
This is awesome.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.781
Yeah!

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.030
Oh, this is hard.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.940
Shit.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.264
Oh, shit, what's wrong?

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.544
The numbers I gave you
on potato output...

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.140
are exaggerated.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.020
That's okay with me.
I don't really care about that.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.140
We can get back to what we were doing.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.500
No, it's not just the numbers!

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.700
- I am a terrible person.
- No. You're the best person.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.860
You were about to have sex with me.
That's the best thing someone could do.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.667
I'm the propagandist
of a totalitarian dictatorship.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.260
That's an area you could improve,
but you don't have to dwell on it.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.340
He's as cruel as his father
and grandfather before him!

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.100
You knew this this whole time.
Why is this just bothering you now?

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.700
It's been bothering me for a long time.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.260
And I'm not the only one.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.703
But too many people see him as a god.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.020
How do you prove to 24 million people...

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.702
that their god is a murderer and a liar?

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.260
- Aaron, I need to talk.
- Fuck, it's Dave. Shit.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.940
You hide in there.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.507
- I'll go deal with him.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.620
- Aaron, are you here?
- Yeah, one sec. One sec.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.551
- Don't come in, don't come in!
- I need to talk.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.860
- Hey, how's it going, dude?
- Not good.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.260
We should take a walk.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.940
No, no, no. I can't walk this off.
I cannot walk this off.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.301
I need to...

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.340
I'm so fucking pissed.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.510
- I just wanna hit something!
- No! Don't punch anything!

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.820
Breathe. Just breathe.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.900
- Maybe pace it out.
- Fuck, man.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.100
Kim.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.940
- What about him?
- He's going crazy.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.260
He's gonna blow up the world
just to show that he's the shit!

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.740
And at first I thought:

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.911
"All right, maybe he's just talking,
you know. Maybe he doesn't mean it."

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.100
- Then I saw this fake fucking grapefruit.
- What?

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.700
All the food in that
grocery store is fake!

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.220
He fucking lied to me.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.860
Maybe that fat kid isn't fat.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.020
I mean, oh!
What about the concentration camps?

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.303
And the famine. Maybe that's real. God!

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.820
It is. I've been telling you that
for weeks now.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.180
He fucking honeydicked me.
He honeydicked the shit out of me.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.462
- Sucks.
- You still got that poison?

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.860
You can't speak? What the fuck?

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.660
I wanna know if you have the poison
so we can kill that motherfucker.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.860
What?!

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.900
Spy! What the hell?!

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.580
- She's on our side!
- Fuck's going on?!

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.340
- You can trust me.
- You can trust her!

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.580
Trust her?! Are you joking?!
We gotta kill her!

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.940
I was in bed with her!

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.980
We were hooking up.
That's why she's here.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.180
- What?!
- Let him go. Everything is fine.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.500
Now we gotta kill the girl that you like.
This is the worst moment ever!

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.464
We're not killing her!

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.300
- She's loyal to Kim.
- No! Dude!

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.580
She was just telling me she's with us.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.860
I hate Kim. He is a terrible leader.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.180
- See?
- Okay.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.900
She can help us kill him.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.700
What? No! No! No killing!

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.300
Kim must die! That's the American way.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.300
How many times can the U.S.
make the same mistake?

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.860
As many times as it takes.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.580
Killing Kim won't change anything.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.580
You said it yourself!
We gotta do something. Right?

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.620
He will be replaced.
He has brothers, other generals.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.220
The people need to be shown
that he is not a god.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.780
That he is a man.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.180
Then they will be ready for change.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.064
Yeah? How?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.300
Interviewing him.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.180
Everyone in North Korea
will be watching.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.260
No, look, the interview's scripted.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.380
His people are never gonna let me
ask real questions.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.780
- Dave, I am his people.
- She controls the broadcast.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.100
I can't do political interviews.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.980
I do entertainment interviews.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.380
- Dude. You can fucking do this.
- Yeah?

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.180
You don't interview with your brain.
You interview with your heart.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.700
- True.
- Your emotion, Dave.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.100
You get Kim Jong-un to fucking cry
like a baby in front of all of North Korea?

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.029
They'll know he's not a god.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.304
I think I can do this.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.100
You can do it.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.780
I'm Dave Skylark...

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.100
and I can interview anyone.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.463
- Yeah, you can.
- Let's take this motherfucker down!

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.340
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.384
You got a lot of pent-up energy!
Oh, God!

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.900
Okay. Everything's ready.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.380
You ready to rock?
You memorize those facts?

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.380
- I'm ready, baby.
- Great.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.860
- How many people in camps?
- Two hundred thousand.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.180
- How many malnourished?
- Sixteen million.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.540
They spent 800 million
on nukes last year...

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.471
and got 200 million in food aid
from the U.N.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.780
And I got more
where that came from, baby.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.420
You're gonna nail this shit.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.220
I just wish we had an escape plan.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.660
- Why don't we go to Japan?
- It's across the Sea of Japan.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.100
- Why don't we swim?
- Can't swim that.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.980
- I'm a good swimmer.
- It's really far.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.780
- People have done it.
- Nope.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.260
- Michael Phelps did it.
- Not true.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.588
- Okay.
- Skylark, two-minute warning.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.990
- Keep me on the air as long as you can.
- I will, man.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.391
- Maybe we won't get out of here.
- No. We might die.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.304
I've had a great life.
I had the best, best friend.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.900
Fucked more women than Ellen DeGeneres.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.821
Now, it's time for the North Korean
people to get their dicks wet.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.827
This is a perfect ending
for the tell-all.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.306
As the two best friends stared
each other in the eyes...

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.500
they knew...

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.460
that this might be the end
of the long road.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.580
But they also knew...

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.780
how much they meant to each other.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.780
And even though neither one
could say it out loud...

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.551
they were both thinking:

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.220
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.980
Bro.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.150
- Okay, man. You got this.
- Okay.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.590
Showtime.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.140
Dave.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.141
Kim.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.380
Are you ready to share with the world
that gorgeous smile of yours?

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.789
Tonight, I think it's your smile
they wanna see.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.980
I have something for you.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.306
What?

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.983
- What's this?
- Open.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.542
- For me?
- For you.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.900
He's just like Digby.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.180
Just like Digby.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.509
- I think I'm gonna die. Oh, my God.
- Don't die, please.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.780
Not till after the interview.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.180
This dog is killing me with cuteness.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.460
He's crazy cute.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.743
- Can I keep it?
- Take him home, forever and ever.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.941
Why?

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.620
I live a lonely life, Dave.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.180
And it warms my heart to know
that there is someone in this world...

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.543
with whom I can truly be myself.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.622
Whatever they say about you...

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.706
they're wrong.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.260
I'm just me, and I do my best.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.030
You're my brother.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.705
You're my brother.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.460
Let's get this out of the way, okay?

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.460
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.740
And what are we gonna name you, huh?

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.704
You need a name? Yes, you do.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.346
Look, look. He looks just like Digby.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.500
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.862
We'll see you in a minute. Bye-bye.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.500
- Okay. Shall we begin?
- Okay. You ready?

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.862
Shut the fuck up. Guys, it's starting!

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.420
And we're on in five...

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.463
four, three...

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.820
Good evening. And good morning
to our viewers around the world.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.620
I'm Dave Skylark.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.620
Thank you for joining me
for this historic moment in history.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.820
I'm with President Kim Jong-un...

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.780
of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.460
We are broadcasting from a station
outside of Pyongyang...

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.631
for this very special edition of:
Skylark Tonight.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.420
Thank you for joining me,
President Kim Jong-un.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.060
It is my pleasure, Dave. You know...

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.500
there is so much misunderstanding
about North Korea...

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.460
and me personally.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.100
And I can't think of a man
with greater intelligence than you.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.300
I am grateful...

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.140
for this opportunity for my government
and for the international community...

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.980
to forge a better relationship.

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.020
- So you wanna set the record straight.
- Indeed, Dave.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.381
Camera three.

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.420
Tensions between your nation
and South Korea are at a high.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.620
It's fair to say that you're
on the brink of armed conflict.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.980
So what I want to know is...

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.860
in these times of great stress...

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.700
do you do karaoke?

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.260
Yes, I do, Dave.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.060
I believe that it is important
for those in power...

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.620
to remain in touch
with the beauty in life.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.820
You are also a very accomplished
painter, aren't you?

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.260
Well, how can I not be?

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.820
- He's reading the script.
- He lulls them and then he gets them.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.300
It's his technique.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.820
The beauty guides you.

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.306
It guides my hand.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.940
This is fucking bullshit.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.300
Let's take it to a serious tip.
Supreme Leader Kim...

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.820
when the United States, which has an
enormous stockpile of nuclear weapons...

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.070
insists that countries like yours
have none...

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.580
does that feel hypocritical to you?

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.460
Many Americans do not realize...

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.060
that the war in North Korea was
entirely the fault of the United States.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.820
Damn! Kim's calling us out!

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.780
- You really are still hopeful?
- No.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.180
I'm not hopeful at all.
He's bailed on the plan.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.340
America, what you done to these Koreans?

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.500
This is a little embarrassing.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.220
When you think of all
that your country has been through...

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.100
the wars, the floods...

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.820
do you think your people
should be rewarded...

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.990
for their resilience and strength?

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.622
Of course, Dave.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.749
Then, why don't you feed them?

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.030
I...

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.421
Camera two.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.180
I beg your pardon?

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.340
Why don't you feed your people?

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.620
They are hungry.
Specifically, two-thirds of them.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.220
Isn't that embarrassing since you're the
one they view as a provider and a god?

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.300
And you spend $800 million
on nukes every year?

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.548
And you have 16 million starving people?

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.500
Are you sure you don't...

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.140
mean to ask me about potato yields?

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.060
No. I wanna know about
that other thing I just asked.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.580
Okay, well...

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.386
Dave, as you have seen for yourself...

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.660
we have a great bounty of food
in North Korea.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.220
What I saw for myself...

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.220
was a fake grocery store...

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:38.151
with a fake fat kid
planted right in from' of it!

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.660
Okay, this is an offensive line
of questioning.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.420
I don't think it's offensive.
It's important.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.260
If you don't wanna answer,
you can get up and walk away.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.100
I can't keep you from retreating.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.020
- He's gonna go for the button.
- He's sitting there. Not moving.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.100
- He's going for the button!
- He's not.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.349
- Oh, shit. He's making a move!
- Don't move, homie!

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.831
Get your hand away!

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.660
I will cap you! I'm exploding with energy.
I can't believe this.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.147
I feel so alive right now.
This is so real.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.500
He's got him. Nice!

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.226
- Dave! Dave.
- I know you, Kim.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.540
Dave, perhaps the question
you should ask is:

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.140
How have I managed to keep my country
so well-nourished...

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.260
despite the harsh
and unjust economic sanctions...

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.431
imposed on North Korea
by the United States?

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.226
Sanctions?

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.140
Don't you know that the U.S. has more
incarcerated people per capita than us?

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.340
No. But...

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.020
So perhaps now you would like
to return to the civil discussion...

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.382
we had originally agreed upon.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.504
No! Get him!

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.742
Oh, shit! Go to camera one!

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.063
Camera three! Camera three!

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.301
Do not move, homie!

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.709
Give me something!
Give me fucking something! Okay.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:36.060
Why?! Fuck! Shit, that hurts!

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.580
We don't have concentration camps, Dave.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:43.229
Have you seen one person mistreated
since your arrival here?

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.944
Oh, shit! Shit. Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.380
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.380
Dave, unless you can show me
a person, a photo...

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.264
of widespread hunger...

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.025
Aaron!

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.589
Do not fuck with my angles!

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.222
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.304
You're fucking up the angles!

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.150
Sit still!

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.621
Slow push!

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.500
Thank you!

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.700
Face it, Dave, you have failed.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.260
You've made wild allegations,
but you have proven nothing.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:21.260
You made this long journey just to show
the world that they were right about you.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.420
You are incapable
of conducting a real interview.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.304
You're a joke!

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.785
Maybe you're right.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.946
Yeah, it sucks.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.662
Because I need people's approval.

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.780
Desperately.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.789
Because I could never get it...

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.621
from my father when I was a kid.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.110
But I see a lot of the
same thing in you, Kim.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.745
Your father...

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.705
deprived you of life's
simplest pleasures.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.388
He told you that margaritas are gay.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.905
I have no comment on margaritas.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:15.750
- Then why don't you drink them?
- I don't like brain freeze.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.620
Fuck you, Dave.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.740
You fucking asshole!

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.420
I just have one more question for you.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.980
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.868
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.460
- What is that? I don't know what that is.
- Yes, you do.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.100
No, I don't. I never heard that before.

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.100
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper-thin

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.500
Just like a house of cards

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.226
One blow from caving in?

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.340
- I don't know what you're singing.
- You know what it is.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.781
- No, I don't.
- You don't need to lie.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.380
Katy Perry's your favorite!

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.780
Katy who? I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.260
You just gotta ignite the light

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.660
And let it shine

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.740
Not the chorus, please!

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.820
And own the night
Like it's the Fourth of July

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:24.140
- 'Cause, Kimmy, you're a firework
- Stop!

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.300
Go and show 'em what you're worth

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.820
And make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.547
As you sail across the sky-y-y

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.300
Kimmy, you're a firework

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.780
No!

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.140
I don't need my father!

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.741
I am strong!

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.060
Excuse me.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.740
- Did you just shart?
- No, I didn't.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.100
It was that camera guy.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.340
It wasn't me.

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:21.670
Ladies and gentlemen, Kim Jong-un
has just pooed in his pants.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.349
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:31.871
Yeah. Let's go.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.220
Damn, girl. You a badass.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.940
I thought you were my friend, Dave.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.029
I thought you were my friend, Kim.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.900
I thought everyone lied about you.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.380
And then I saw that fake grapefruit...

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.264
in that fake grocery store...

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.347
and I realized
that you were a fake friend.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:34.020
You said you were gonna
blow everybody up...

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.420
just to show what a big guy you are?

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.180
No friend would blow up
another friend's country.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:42.660
You're just a flawed man
with a big ol' butthole.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.908
And you pee and poo like the rest of us.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.465
Well, tell me this, Dave:

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.580
Will you be so cocky when I slay you
in front of the whole world...

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.942
you Yankee motherfucker?

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:09.623
If you shoot me,
you'll just be proving me right.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.350
You're just a sad, little man.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.861
Dave! Dave, no!

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.780
This is Dave Skylark...

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.630
signing off.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.503
Goodbye, Dave.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.946
Oh, man.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.220
Bulletproof vest.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.024
Genius!

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.180
He's alive, everybody. Oh, fuck!

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.020
Got a bulletproof vest on!
I don't know how he got it!

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.580
But he's got it on!

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.980
Thank you for watching my interview.

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.500
This is Dave Skylark...

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.668
signing off.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.345
- No!
- Aaron!

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.260
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Wait! The puppy.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.820
- What happened to your hand?
- Someone bit my fucking fingers off.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:23.307
- That's just like Frodo!
- Whoa! Shit!

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.791
Don't shoot! I have a puppy!

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.341
Go!

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.620
- Oh, no, no! Oh! Oh, no!
- Who is that?!

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.300
- Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!
- Keep shooting!

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.620
Oh, no!

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.822
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! There's more!

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.908
You're a hero! Thank you, sir!

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.420
That's the only way out!

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.021
Hey. I have an idea.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.746
Follow me.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.780
Is this Katy fucking Perry?!

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.823
Leave it on!
It's helping me concentrate!

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.464
- Oh, shit. Are those fucking nukes?!
- Let me check.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.183
Oh, we really fucked up!
He's arming his fucking nukes!

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.907
Fuck!

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.903
Skylark!

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.100
Kim!

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.064
Fuck you!

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.660
I've been grazed!

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.420
- How's the puppy?
- Puppy is okay!

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.429
Protect that puppy with your life!

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.740
We gotta do something!
He's gonna kill us!

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.942
We're in a tank! Shoot him back!

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.941
- It's loaded!
- Let's barbecue this motherfucker!

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.905
On three!

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.346
Balls to the wall!

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.351
Boom, boom...

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.466
boom!

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.990
Yes! Yes!

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.060
Yes!

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.911
Okay.

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:51.300
That way. It's an old mining tunnel.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.580
- Holy shit, where does that go?
- West. Away from Pyongyang.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.140
Keep moving until you reach the coast.
I wish you both luck.

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.380
You sound like
you're not coming with us.

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.820
- I have to go to Pyongyang.
- Right back into the snake pit!

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.020
I can't leave North Korea.
I just helped plunge it into chaos!

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.740
So did we. I'm okay with leaving.

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:11.940
I have to ensure that the power does
not transfer to the wrong hands.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.905
I can't deny that we have chemistry.

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:18.146
But I have to stay here for my people.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.781
Okay.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.180
I'm glad to meet you.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.506
Okay.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.504
Kiss her.

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.310
Kiss her, dude.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:31.981
Yeah, get in there.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.666
Nice.

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.068
I'm happy to have met you, Aaron.

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.221
Me too.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.107
Bye, Sook!

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.709
Have fun with the war.

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.149
- All right, it's clear.
- Okay.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:18.901
Okay, here you go.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.740
- You got him?
- Yeah.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:24.068
You out of that big ol' scary hole?

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.780
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.020
Is this China?

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.905
- I don't know. Looks like North Korea.
- Yeah.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.380
- Man.
- Which Way's the coast?

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:38.980
I have no idea. Does that do something?

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.420
- Dogs always run to the sea.
- Not true.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.260
- You gotta find the sea.
- That's not gonna happen.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.860
Shit.

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.660
- Shit, shit, shit!
- Protect the puppy!

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.589
Stop! It's them!

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.980
Echo Romeo Five, Echo Romeo Five.

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.700
We have contact
with Dung Beetle and Aardvark.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.140
Aaron, Dave.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.060
- I'm Captain Sung, SEAL Team 6.
- Holy shit.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:03.380
How'd you find us?

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.980
The GPS on your wristwatch.
Let's get you boys home.

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.420
- Oh, my God!
- For you.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:12.271
- For me?
- Is it the president?

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.020
- Mr. Obama?
- Nope, just me. Agent Lacey.

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.951
Agent Lacey.
Fancy hearing from you here.

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.460
I enjoyed your interview, guys.

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.780
Now, try not to fuck up your extraction.

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:26.060
Get home safe.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:29.540
Guess who's going to America
where they don't eat doggies?

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:33.222
- And you get all the good stuff.
- Let's just go. Can we please go?

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.941
Get them in.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.660
She honeypotted me.

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:17.220
- What? What are you talking about?
- Sook.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.311
Think about it, man. I mean,
she researched me, she seduced me...

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:25.380
she commandeered my plans,
made them her own. She used me.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.420
I'll admit it was for, like,
a really good fucking cause...

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.031
but she honeypotted me.

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:34.980
Yeah. Well, good riddance.
I hated that fucking bitch.

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:36.181
Really?

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:40.580
No. Just thought
it'd make you feel better.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.620
That was your one true love.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.620
Now she's gone.

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.221
Doesn't make me feel any better.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.300
Well, you have us.

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.150
And we love you!

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.183
We all love each other!

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:11.980
"And as the North Korean coastline
receded in the distance...

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.660
we heard the crackle of gunfire.

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:18.346
It was the beginning of a revolution.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.100
A revolution Aaron and I had started.

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.300
- Of course, in a tale like this...
- Malcolm.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.741
You might expect to find some...

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.865
...hot CIA honeypot bombshell."

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.661
"Maybe a few drones...

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.900
or a secret CIA watch."

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.980
- You got Skype.
- So good to see you.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.103
Wait, someone else wants to say hi.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:55.860
Guess what we named him? Kim Jong-un!

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.660
That's a little fucked up, no?

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.940
It's super fucked up. But he's cute.

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.983
"But there was none of that.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.700
No.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.900
This was a revolution...

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.340
ignited with nothing more
than a camera...

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.110
and some questions.

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.940
Questions that led a man...

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.540
once revered as a god...

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.500
among mortals...

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.705
...to cry and shit his pants."

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.831
The end.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:26.946
Thank you.
