Good evening.
I'm Diane Simmons.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.872
In traffic news, heavy gridlock
on the 195 interchange.

00:40.874 --> 00:45.243
We now go live to Drunk Billy
in the Channel 5 news copter.

00:48.414 --> 00:49.147
This just in.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.283
Channel 5 news copter pilot
Drunk Billy passed away today.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.952
In anticipation
of this event,

00:53.954 --> 00:55.020
we put together
a clip package

00:55.022 --> 00:58.723
featuring some of Billy's work
for Channel 5 News.

01:01.894 --> 01:04.929
(people screaming)

01:11.504 --> 01:15.206
"I'm still hungry," said
the very hungry caterpillar.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.842
"But you've already..."

01:20.446 --> 01:22.280
Drunk Billy
will be missed.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.449
But what you shouldn't miss
is the Quahog Rodeo,

01:24.451 --> 01:26.818
coming to the Civic Center
this Friday.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.886
Tickets are on sale now.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.821
And for those of you who
are handy with a horse,

01:29.823 --> 01:31.089
entry spots are still open.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.825
Oh, God, this seems like
the kind of thing Peter...

01:33.827 --> 01:34.426
Too late, Brian.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.927
Peter, you're gonna
enter the rodeo?

01:35.929 --> 01:38.163
That's stupid. You don't know
anything about horses,

01:38.165 --> 01:39.597
and you're
in terrible shape.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.933
You know, that's the difference
between you and me, Lois.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.301
When life comes
knocking at the door,

01:43.303 --> 01:44.469
you go and hide
in the kitchen.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.204
I fling the door
wide open and I say,

01:46.206 --> 01:47.539
"Peter Griffin here.
What do you got?"

01:47.541 --> 01:49.407
And if that don't convince you,
look at this.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.042
In this week's <i>TV Guide,</i>
<i>it says,</i>

01:51.044 --> 01:52.577
"Peter gets more
than he bargained for

01:52.579 --> 01:54.012
when he joins the rodeo."

01:54.014 --> 01:55.180
Well, it's in the <i>Guide.</i>

01:55.182 --> 01:56.381
Hey, can we make that a thing?

01:56.383 --> 01:58.083
Can we start calling <i>TV Guide,</i>
<i>"the Guide"?</i>

01:58.085 --> 02:00.085
You know what?
I'm not even asking anymore.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.119
That's what we're doing.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.954
Who says I couldn't
be a rodeo star?

02:02.956 --> 02:06.091
I got more cowboy blood in me
than Billy the Kid.

02:06.093 --> 02:11.596
♪ Well, he robbed his way
from Utah to Oklahoma ♪

02:11.598 --> 02:17.469

(screams)

03:22.568 --> 03:23.902
Dad, what are
you doing?!

03:23.904 --> 03:26.070
All right, Meg,
this is only gonna hurt

03:26.072 --> 03:27.806
for about three weeks.

03:28.407 --> 03:29.474
What the hell?

03:29.476 --> 03:32.911
That there's my
steer, Griffin.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.184
All right, Lois.
Go ahead. Say it.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.218
(groans)

03:40.220 --> 03:43.021
Chris, it's time for supper.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.390
Ho der, ho der, ho der!

03:45.392 --> 03:47.058
Ho der, ho der, ho der, ho der!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.394
Ho der, ho der, ho der!
Ho der, ho der!

03:49.396 --> 03:51.229
Ho der, ho der, ho der.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.933
(softly):
Ho der, ho der, ho der.

03:54.935 --> 03:55.633
Ho der.

03:55.635 --> 03:59.571
All right.
I am ready for the rodeo.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.976
Mom, when's it
Dad's turn?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.077
I don't know, Chris.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.912
But I think we should
all pray for your father

04:07.914 --> 04:09.581
that he comes
out of this uninjured.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.748
Those horses stink.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.217
And it's too hot in here.

04:12.219 --> 04:15.386
I fell asleep in the car,
so now I'm cranky.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.288
This is a
disgusting display.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.289
Boy, you can
say that again.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.626
Nothing like a bunch of adult
men teasing animals for fun.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.695
It's amazing that
this is still legal.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.029
The only reason I'm here

04:25.031 --> 04:26.698
is 'cause my idiot friend
is in the rodeo.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.567
I only came 'cause I'm
writing a magazine article.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.501
One of the competitors

04:30.503 --> 04:32.503
is a 13-year-old
female riding prodigy.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.572
Apparently she got on
the bull to miscarry,

04:34.574 --> 04:36.641
and found out she
had a talent for it.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.343
ANNOUNCER (over speaker):
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:38.345 --> 04:40.445
give an indifferent
East Coast welcome

04:40.447 --> 04:44.082
to the newest bull rider,
Peter the Kid!

04:47.119 --> 04:48.486
(screams)

04:48.488 --> 04:50.955
You know what I am
back at the ranch?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.724
I'm a breeding bull.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.392
W-What-What's that?

04:54.394 --> 04:56.427
You gonna find out.
(gasps)

04:56.429 --> 04:57.562
Where you goin', fatty?

04:57.564 --> 04:59.063
We gonna have a party.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.331
(screaming)

05:00.333 --> 05:01.633
No! No!

05:01.635 --> 05:05.069
(screaming)

05:05.071 --> 05:07.772
(sobbing)

05:07.774 --> 05:08.806
(all gasp)

05:08.808 --> 05:10.008
(Peter screaming)

05:10.010 --> 05:11.542
So, what magazine
do you write for?

05:11.544 --> 05:14.045
I'm the editor
for <i>Teen People.</i>

05:14.047 --> 05:14.479
Editor?

05:14.481 --> 05:18.049
Well, gosh, you know, I'm
something of a writer myself.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.485
I-I wrote for <i>The New Yorker</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

05:20.487 --> 05:21.753
Wow, that's impressive.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.288
Are you looking for work?

05:23.290 --> 05:24.155
Oh, no. No, no, no.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.357
I-I never have to look
too far for that.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.292
I... W-W-What are you...

05:27.294 --> 05:28.259
What do you...
What-What do you got?

05:28.261 --> 05:29.794
Well, we're looking for
someone to write a piece

05:29.796 --> 05:31.195
on the everyday activities

05:31.197 --> 05:33.031
of the average
American teenage girl.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.532
Oh, I love teenage girls.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.134
It's all ahead of them,
you know?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.802
They haven't turned
into bitches yet.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.404
Oh, it's true.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.638
What happened
to all of us?

05:40.640 --> 05:43.875
I got a house on the Cape.
Maybe you come visit.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.976
(feebly):
Maybe.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.611
Maybe you call
a few days in advance

05:46.613 --> 05:49.213
to give me time
to get the house clean.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.214
Okay.

05:50.216 --> 05:51.215
Maybe you bring a blazer,

05:51.217 --> 05:53.518
so we can go to a wider
range of restaurants.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.420
I'll-I'll bring a blazer.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.290
You see this, Rupert?

05:59.292 --> 06:00.692
Most children build
a sand castle.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.595
But I'm building a sand retreat
for singles in their 30s.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.597
(deep voice):
Hi, I'm Jeremy.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.132
I work in corporate finance.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.802
(high voice):
Hi, I'm a French-Canadian girl

06:10.804 --> 06:12.370
down here on my vacation.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.573
It's a big deal for me
to be down here on my own.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.675
I like the swimming pool
with a bar in it

06:17.677 --> 06:20.311
'cause you can sit on a barstool
and you're in the water.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.548
(deep voice):
I like how all the food
and drink is included

06:23.550 --> 06:24.716
in the price of the ticket.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.584
(high voice):
Yeah, that way you don't have

06:26.586 --> 06:28.353
to bring your cash
down from the room.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.489
(deep voice):
Okay, I was just looking
for a friend of mine,

06:31.491 --> 06:32.657
so maybe I'll see you later.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.225
(high voice):
Good for you, Janine.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.462
You promised yourself you'd talk
to somebody and you did it.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.797
(normal voice):
Brian, what are you doing
up there?

06:39.799 --> 06:41.099
Shh. I'm writing an article

06:41.101 --> 06:42.333
on teenage girls for a magazine.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.669
I'm studying Meg to see
what goes on during her day.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.138
Well, be careful
you don't fall off that ladder.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.606
Not all dogs go to heaven.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.408
So, says here
you were involved

06:50.410 --> 06:51.609
in the plotting
of September 11?

06:51.611 --> 06:55.613
Well, that's what they
get for supporting Israel.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.282
Hyuck, yuck,
yuck. Gawsh.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.752
Okay, into the eternal
pit of fire you go.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.322
Wa-hoo-hoo-hoo-ee!

07:08.761 --> 07:11.295
You know, Brian, just because
you're writing a profile

07:11.297 --> 07:12.563
on teenage girls,
it doesn't mean you have

07:12.565 --> 07:15.833
to be a creepy stalker
and follow Meg around all day.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.301
It's called
research, Stewie.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.536
I'm just being
thorough.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.670
Where the hell
is she going?

07:19.672 --> 07:22.340
There's nothing out
in this part of town.

07:25.577 --> 07:26.544
What is that, Brian?

07:26.546 --> 07:28.579
What is an adult
correctional institute?

07:28.581 --> 07:30.214
It's a prison, Stewie.

07:30.216 --> 07:30.715
Ah.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.317
One would think
they could just say that.

07:37.556 --> 07:38.556
Hi, Meg.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.124
Hi, Luke.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.267
(both gasp)

07:49.269 --> 07:50.301
Oh, my God.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.236
Meg's dating a convict!

07:52.238 --> 07:54.739
Oh, looks like Consuela's son
is in prison.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.742
I see you soon, Rodrigo.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.178
<i>Sí, mama.</i>

08:07.386 --> 08:09.253
It's really good
to see you, Meg.

08:09.255 --> 08:10.455
It's been a while.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.556
I know.
I'm sorry, Luke.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.424
It's just so hard
to get over here

08:13.426 --> 08:14.425
without anybody
finding out.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.994
Have you gotten all the letters
and hair that I've sent?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.362
It's the only thing

08:18.364 --> 08:19.764
that's getting me by,
Meg. Thank you.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.998
How'd your parole hearing go?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.634
Not good.
Looks like I'm gonna be in here

08:23.636 --> 08:25.736
another three years.
Oh, Luke.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.538
Oh, I don't expect you
to wait for me, Meg.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.641
No, I will, Luke. If it takes
ten years or 20 years,

08:30.643 --> 08:33.177
I will be here when you get out.

08:42.387 --> 08:43.488
Oh, my God!

08:43.490 --> 08:44.689
Meg's involved
with a convict!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.891
Wow, Meg's like one
of those crazy chicks

08:46.893 --> 08:50.228
who hooks up with
an even crazier guy.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.833
Brian, you bastard!

08:55.835 --> 08:57.435
How could you
do this to me?!

08:57.437 --> 08:59.036
I'm sorry, Meg.
I had to tell them!

08:59.038 --> 09:00.705
Don't give him crap
for this, Meg.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.807
He did exactly the right thing
by coming to us.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.809
Don't you know
what kind of fire

09:04.811 --> 09:06.444
you're playing with,
dating a prisoner?

09:06.446 --> 09:08.513
Hold on, Lois. This is
some serious parenting.

09:08.515 --> 09:11.415
I'm gonna go put on
my Cosby sweater.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.717
Mom, you don't understand!

09:12.719 --> 09:15.019
Luke and I really connect,
very deeply!

09:15.021 --> 09:18.623
He's all alone in there,
and I'm all alone out here.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.424
In a way, we're both in prison.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.527
Well, Meg, there's a
big difference there.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.328
He's in prison
for a reason.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.596
He broke the law!

09:25.598 --> 09:26.831
He robbed
a convenience store

09:26.833 --> 09:28.666
to pay for medication
for his mom.

09:28.668 --> 09:32.370
Oh, I'm sure he gave you a
very convincing sob story.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.839
It's not a sob story!
It's true!

09:34.841 --> 09:36.474
Frankly, I don't care, Meg.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.942
I do not want you
seeing him again!

09:37.944 --> 09:39.310
I can't find
the sweater.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.878
How the hell did you
even meet him?!

09:40.880 --> 09:42.547
We had a pen pal project
at school,

09:42.549 --> 09:43.814
and when it was over,
Luke and I

09:43.816 --> 09:45.883
just kind of kept writing
to each other.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.285
Well, it stops now!

09:47.287 --> 09:48.886
But, Mom, I love him!

09:48.888 --> 09:50.054
It stops now, Meg!

09:50.056 --> 09:51.956
Your mother's right, Meg.
You got to be careful

09:51.958 --> 09:53.758
who you get involved with
romantically.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.059
(cell phone rings)

09:55.061 --> 09:55.793
Hello?

09:55.795 --> 09:57.762
I'm in the mood
for some coitus.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.629
Get over here.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.031
I can't.
I'm with my family.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.766
Pick up wine
on the way.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.468
Well, Angela, if I'm really
the only guy at work

10:04.470 --> 10:07.905
who can solve it,
I'll be right there.

10:09.741 --> 10:11.809
(sobbing)

10:12.778 --> 10:14.445
(rapping at window)

10:14.447 --> 10:17.114
(gasps)

10:17.116 --> 10:17.815
Luke!

10:17.817 --> 10:19.483
What are you
doing here?!

10:19.485 --> 10:20.484
I escaped, Meg.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.119
I escaped 'cause I
just couldn't bear

10:22.121 --> 10:23.554
another second
away from you.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.423
My God,
how did you get out?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.158
I filed down a toothbrush
to a fine point

10:27.160 --> 10:29.327
and stabbed the guard
with the most kids.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.628
What?!
I'm just kidding.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.864
Oh. I'm still getting used
to your sense of humor.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.033
Actually, there was a riot
in the prison yard,

10:36.035 --> 10:37.301
and I slipped
over the fence.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.205
Well, well, quick, get in here
before somebody sees you!

10:43.875 --> 10:46.978
Oh, Meg, I've wanted
to do that for so long.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.314
And it's nice to be in front
of someone for a change.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.148
(laughing)

10:51.150 --> 10:53.551
Now, I know
that was a joke!

10:53.553 --> 10:55.319
(laughs)
Whatever.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.587
Hey, Meg?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.589
Can I talk to you for a second?

10:58.591 --> 11:00.057
(rustling, door closing)

11:00.059 --> 11:03.261
MEG:
Uh, yeah, come on in.

11:03.595 --> 11:06.697
Listen, uh, I feel like
I should explain myself

11:06.699 --> 11:07.665
a little bit here.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.900
I'm sorry I had to tell Lois
what was going on.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.302
You just,
you gotta realize

11:11.304 --> 11:13.437
I was only thinking
about your safety and...

11:13.439 --> 11:16.040
(man sneezes)

11:16.042 --> 11:17.608
(growls)

11:17.610 --> 11:20.878
Luke, you might as well
come out now.

11:21.513 --> 11:24.782
Luke! What the...?
They let you out of jail?!

11:24.784 --> 11:25.783
Not exactly.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.518
He broke out
to see me, Brian.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.653
We're in love.

11:28.655 --> 11:29.453
Meg, are you crazy?!

11:29.455 --> 11:31.489
You can't harbor a fugitive.
That's a felony.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.757
Only if someone
finds out.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.824
Are you gonna do it?

11:33.826 --> 11:36.060
Are you gonna
tell on me again?
Well, I-I...

11:36.062 --> 11:38.863
Brian, will you call me
on my Mickey Mouse phone?

11:38.865 --> 11:39.563
Wait a second.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.966
Why is that guy wearing
a prison jumpsuit?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.434
Think, Peter, think.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.102
Wait. Hang on.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.771
Sunday, Sunday...
Here it is.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.072
"Peter gets more
than he bargains for

11:48.074 --> 11:50.808
when he joins the rodeo."
Boy, did I.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.943
"And Meg dates
a prison escapee"!

11:52.945 --> 11:55.813
Oh, no!
Luke, run!

11:58.150 --> 11:59.183
Joe, it's Peter! Two things:

11:59.185 --> 12:01.852
First of all, when I was over
at your house the other day,

12:01.854 --> 12:04.188
I forgot to tell you how much
I like the rearrangement

12:04.190 --> 12:06.691
you and Bonnie did
with your living room furniture.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.692
Second of all, come outside!

12:07.694 --> 12:10.628
There's an escaped convict
running across the street!

12:24.476 --> 12:27.378
No, Luke, don't run downhill!

12:34.619 --> 12:37.388
You're going to jail, punk!

12:39.958 --> 12:42.760
No, Mr. Swanson,
you can't take him!

12:42.762 --> 12:43.928
Yes, I can, Meg.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.096
He's going back
to jail.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.997
Well, if you're
taking him to jail,

12:46.999 --> 12:48.199
you have to take me, too!

12:48.201 --> 12:49.433
I know. That's the plan.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.603
You're under arrest for
harboring an escaped convict.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.872
Oh, well, that's only fair
because after all,

12:54.874 --> 12:56.574
I did hide him from the...

12:56.576 --> 12:57.875
<i>What?!</i>

13:05.751 --> 13:06.617
Uh, hi.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.821
Did you also get caught
trying to vote in Ohio?

13:14.626 --> 13:17.094
Well, this is it.
Meg gets out of jail today.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.630
Already? It seems like just
yesterday we rented her room

13:19.632 --> 13:23.234
to that fly that wants to leave,
but can't figure it out.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.068
(buzzing)

13:24.070 --> 13:26.137
FLY:
Okay, now where now?
PETER: Right there.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.772
I'm having some
trouble here.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.707
It's right there!
It's right in front of you!

13:29.709 --> 13:31.742
Okay, I can hear you.
Volume's not a problem.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.944
I'm just not quite seeing
what you're referring to.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.780
Okay, then fly, fly
out the window.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.981
Up here maybe?
No, to your left!

13:36.983 --> 13:39.016
No, that's not it.
That's just more wall.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.284
How many eyes
do you have, huh?!

13:40.286 --> 13:42.987
Just two, same number as you,
but I can't, I'm not...

13:42.989 --> 13:44.588
Just go! Oh, my God!
Whatever it is

13:44.590 --> 13:46.357
you're driving at, I'm just
apparently not getting it,

13:46.359 --> 13:49.460
so I'm just gonna go
back upstairs.
You're right there!

13:50.562 --> 13:52.530
I think we should all go
together to pick Meg up.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.999
She's probably a little fragile
after being in there so long,

13:55.001 --> 13:59.103
and I'm sure she'll be heartened
to see our faces.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.840
I'm home.
You're all my bitches now.

14:04.609 --> 14:05.876
Okay.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.516
Meg! You look
so different.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.618
How was prison?

14:14.620 --> 14:15.653
First question:

14:15.655 --> 14:17.788
who's the biggest, toughest guy
in this house?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.790
Well, I don't like
to toot my own horn,

14:19.792 --> 14:22.526
but I believe I hold
the distinction... (grunts)

14:23.595 --> 14:25.629
(grunting)

14:30.669 --> 14:32.336
My house now, bitch!

14:32.338 --> 14:33.938
Now, who's the funniest?

14:33.940 --> 14:35.739
I know my way
around a joke.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.541
(gasping, grunting)

14:37.543 --> 14:38.776
For God's sake, Dad,

14:38.778 --> 14:42.546
have some humility!
It'll save your life!

14:42.548 --> 14:44.849
There better be beer
in the fridge.

14:44.851 --> 14:48.118
Boy, I liked her better when
she was more predictable...

14:48.120 --> 14:50.354
like the stock photos
on a corporate Web site.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.456
I'm a woman in a lab coat
wearing goggles,

14:52.458 --> 14:55.593
staring intently at a beaker
that I'm holding near my face.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.894
I'm a Latino in a hard hat,

14:56.896 --> 14:59.363
but I'm also wearing a tie
so you know I'm a supervisor.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.866
We're college students
listening to our professor,

15:01.868 --> 15:05.803
but the class is
taking place <i>outside?!</i>

15:08.607 --> 15:10.975
(water running)

15:12.677 --> 15:13.244
Hey.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.980
Meg! What the hell are you
doing in here?!

15:15.982 --> 15:17.114
Shower time.
Yeah, for me.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.017
Not-not for... What are you
doing with that loofah?

15:20.019 --> 15:21.252
Don't worry about it.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.020
(Peter screams)

15:23.022 --> 15:25.055
You told me
not to worry about it!

15:25.057 --> 15:28.292
I should have been worried
the whole time!

15:30.729 --> 15:33.797
Meg, honey?
I did all your laundry.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.066
Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

15:36.068 --> 15:37.535
It's my poop bucket.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.168
What the hell?!

15:38.170 --> 15:41.138
I'm used to going to the
bathroom in my room.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.139
That's disgusting!

15:42.141 --> 15:45.242
No, you use the toilet here
like everyone else!

15:45.244 --> 15:46.777
No.
Ugh!

15:46.779 --> 15:47.745
God, it smells horrible!

15:47.747 --> 15:51.081
Well, can you at least empty it
each time you use it?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.349
I like to fill it up.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.751
I'm not making
a million trips.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.388
Oh, my God, are you using
my shirts as toilet paper?

15:57.390 --> 15:58.355
Yeah. And I think

15:58.357 --> 16:00.891
I might need
some right now.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.861
Get out now or stay
and get weird.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.863
Your call, warden.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.302
Hey, who's the new dude?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.404
Oh, my God,
that's Meg Griffin!

16:13.406 --> 16:15.372
She just got out
of prison!

16:15.374 --> 16:17.908
Hey, Meg,
what'd they put you in jail for,

16:17.910 --> 16:19.376
being ugly?

16:19.378 --> 16:20.644
(all laugh)

16:20.646 --> 16:21.612
Hey, Meg,
what happened?

16:21.614 --> 16:24.315
Did you get out early
for fat behavior?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.983
(all laugh)

16:25.985 --> 16:26.917
Nice tattoo.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.953
Did you get your butt hair
braided, too,

16:28.955 --> 16:30.321
while you were in there?
(all laugh)

16:30.323 --> 16:32.890
What'd you do,
carve a gun out of soap

16:32.892 --> 16:35.926
and then not wash with it?
Ha-ha! P.U.

16:35.928 --> 16:36.794
(all laugh)

16:36.796 --> 16:39.363
Hey, Meg, are you gonna take
those soda cans

16:39.365 --> 16:41.832
to the Shawskank
Redemption Center?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.801
(all laugh)

16:55.447 --> 16:58.182
Peter, Meg's been suspended
from school.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.017
That's okay.
Whatever she wants to do.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.986
She cracked
three kids' skulls open!

17:01.988 --> 17:03.954
Ever since she's gotten
out of prison,

17:03.956 --> 17:05.823
she is completely out
of control.

17:05.825 --> 17:06.490
Don't you see?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.525
That's what the penal system
does in this country.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.094
It turns small-time offenders
into hardened criminals.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.962
Look at Meg. They took
an innocent little girl

17:11.964 --> 17:16.033
and turned her into a psychotic,
sociopathic freak.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.035
(all gasp)
What'd you say, Brian?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.270
Oh, I-I was just picking up
on something Lois said.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.139
What-what was it?
What'd you say, Lois?

17:22.141 --> 17:23.507
Something about Meg
being a freak?

17:23.509 --> 17:26.010
Oh, no, I didn't say anything.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.444
Uh, Peter said something
about Meg,

17:27.446 --> 17:29.279
which I completely disagree
with.

17:29.281 --> 17:30.547
That-that-that wasn't me.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.416
Stewie was really laying
into Meg about something.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.451
Yeah, it was Stewie.
Definitely Stewie.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.120
Oh, so now
everyone understands me.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.589
Look, Meg, we're just worried
about you.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.290
Well, don't.
I can take care of myself.

17:40.292 --> 17:43.127
I'll be out of here
by the end of the week.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.828
Punch yourself
in the face.

17:44.830 --> 17:45.729
(whimpers)

17:45.731 --> 17:47.364
Punch yourself
in the face!

17:47.366 --> 17:48.499
(whimpering)

17:48.501 --> 17:50.801
All right, he doesn't know
what he's doing.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.804
You, fatso, punch your baby
in the fa...

17:53.806 --> 17:55.172
I did good, Meg?

17:55.174 --> 17:56.940
Shut up.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.411
I did good. I did good.

18:08.787 --> 18:09.520
Drive.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.056
Uh, any particular
direction?

18:12.058 --> 18:14.124
That way.

18:15.293 --> 18:16.994
You're gonna help me
get some money

18:16.996 --> 18:18.328
so I can get out
of this town.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.997
Really?
Where are you gonna go?

18:19.999 --> 18:22.800
I don't know.
Somewhere far away.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.467
Maybe China.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.904
I hear they got NASCAR
there now.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.409
(yelling in Mandarin)

18:34.879 --> 18:36.714
What kind of birdhouse
can you build

18:36.716 --> 18:38.282
with Popsicles,
roofies and a mallet?

18:38.284 --> 18:43.220
It's for a rare African bird
called "Nunya Business."

18:45.023 --> 18:46.890
Hi, Meg.
Can I help you?

18:46.892 --> 18:48.826
Hands in the air, Goldman!

18:48.828 --> 18:50.961
Oh, my God,
what are you doing?!

18:50.963 --> 18:51.862
Gimme your money!

18:51.864 --> 18:53.897
Here, here,
just take this jar

18:53.899 --> 18:54.732
for the leukemia kids.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.867
I don't give it
to 'em anyhow.

18:56.869 --> 18:57.935
Meg, put down the gun.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.269
Brian, get back in the car!

18:59.271 --> 19:03.006
Look, don't do this.
This isn't you, Meg.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.975
What happened to the girl
we used to know?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.944
The one that Luke fell
in love with?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.145
The one he's expecting to see

19:08.147 --> 19:10.547
when he steps out of that prison
in 40 years?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.015
I don't care about Luke.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.151
I don't need him.
I don't need anyone!

19:14.153 --> 19:15.519
Look, if you don't
put the gun down,

19:15.521 --> 19:17.921
I'm gonna be forced
to call the police.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.389
Good! Call the police!

19:19.391 --> 19:20.157
I want you to!

19:20.159 --> 19:22.459
What do I care
if I go back to prison?

19:22.461 --> 19:24.027
Nobody cares about me anyway!

19:24.029 --> 19:25.362
You're wrong, Meg.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.065
I want to show you something.

19:31.302 --> 19:32.369
<i>Teen People?</i>

19:32.371 --> 19:34.571
It's the article
I wrote about you.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.273
You wrote an article
about me?

19:36.275 --> 19:37.407
They wanted a story

19:37.409 --> 19:38.976
about a typical
teenage girl.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.412
Is it "A Fistful of Backne:
Tale of a Teenage Loser"?

19:42.414 --> 19:45.015
Yeah, they make the title.
Read paragraph three.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.416
MORT:
This isn't a library,
you know.

19:46.418 --> 19:49.319
"And in the face
of every adolescent challenge,

19:49.321 --> 19:52.122
"she looks at the world
through hopeful eyes

19:52.124 --> 19:53.624
"and maintains
an uncommon resilience

19:53.626 --> 19:55.025
"that can only be admired.

19:55.027 --> 19:59.029
"In this sense, Meg Griffin is
not the typical American girl.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.432
She is far sweeter and kinder
than that."

20:02.434 --> 20:05.669
Oh, God,
that is so nice, Brian.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.304
Did you mean all that?

20:07.306 --> 20:08.605
Of course I did.

20:08.607 --> 20:09.373
Oh, my God.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.707
I-I can't believe I did this.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.011
I was just so tired of being
everyone's whipping girl

20:14.013 --> 20:17.214
that it felt kind of good
to do some of the whipping.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.383
Give me the gun, Meg.

20:21.219 --> 20:24.855
Thanks for reminding me
who I really am.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.361
Well, at least
I didn't get robbed.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.396
(bell over door chiming)

20:32.398 --> 20:37.167
And what can I do for you
four fine black gentlemen today?

20:40.071 --> 20:43.674
I got to say, Meg, I like you
so much better like this.

20:43.676 --> 20:44.508
Me, too, Meg.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.944
God, it must have been
horrible in there.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.178
It wasn't so bad.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.613
I met Wesley Snipes.
Is that right?

20:49.615 --> 20:52.115
Yeah. Oh,
and you know what's funny?

20:52.117 --> 20:54.051
He was inmate 57, too.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.386
Huh?
He was inmate 57?

20:56.388 --> 20:59.556
See, he did a movie called
<i>Passenger 57.</i>

20:59.558 --> 21:00.591
Ah.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.592
Well, terrific.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.428
Always end on a strong joke.
