WEBVTT

00:00.639 --> 00:03.240
I think you did
an astounding job.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.875
I just don't get it.

00:04.910 --> 00:06.644
Love it,
and I love how you're thinking.

00:06.678 --> 00:08.112
Thank you.

00:08.146 --> 00:10.114
(McKenzie)
Previously on <i> Face Off...</i>

00:10.148 --> 00:13.784
Jamie's wooden bridge troll
earned her her first win,

00:13.818 --> 00:15.553
but Anthony stumbled,

00:15.587 --> 00:18.589
and Team Rayce suffered
their second loss in a row.

00:22.327 --> 00:24.462
Now ten artists remain,

00:24.496 --> 00:27.598
and tonight all bets are off.

00:27.632 --> 00:30.167
Models, come on out.

00:30.202 --> 00:31.335
Ooh.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.037
I've never body-painted
before in my life.

00:33.071 --> 00:34.405
I don't need this now.

00:34.439 --> 00:36.273
Changing it halfway through
isn't helping.

00:36.308 --> 00:38.943
I'm not comfortable
changing my entire paint job.

00:38.977 --> 00:41.479
You will be the one going home.

00:41.513 --> 00:44.515
It looks like a little kid's
painting at a county fair.

00:44.549 --> 00:46.050
(McKenzie)
In the end, only one will win

00:46.084 --> 00:48.386
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

00:48.420 --> 00:51.155
to one of their
85 international locations,

00:51.189 --> 00:54.225
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:54.259 --> 00:56.460
and $100,000.

00:58.096 --> 00:59.997
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

Oh, well, here we go.

01:39.504 --> 01:40.604
This is so weird.

01:40.639 --> 01:42.440
(Jamie)
Beautiful.

01:42.474 --> 01:45.476
(Emily) We walk into the lab, I
see all these different hats,

01:45.510 --> 01:48.112
and I am pumped.

01:48.146 --> 01:51.248
The hats are wild
and very inspiring,

01:51.283 --> 01:54.785
so I'm really excited to hear
what the challenge is.

01:54.820 --> 01:55.786
Hey, guys.

01:55.821 --> 01:57.354
(all)
Hi.

01:57.389 --> 01:59.890
Well, as you can tell,
this is gonna be a fun one,

01:59.925 --> 02:01.826
so let's get to it.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.129
Some of Hollywood's
most unforgettable characters,

02:05.163 --> 02:07.932
like The Cat in the Hat
and Davy Jones,

02:07.966 --> 02:10.601
they're not only known
for the roles they play,

02:10.634 --> 02:12.736
but also their singular hats.

02:12.771 --> 02:14.839
In this Foundation Challenge,

02:14.873 --> 02:17.141
you will select
one of these hats

02:17.175 --> 02:20.811
and use it to inspire an
original character of your own.

02:20.846 --> 02:22.146
This is really cool.

02:22.180 --> 02:23.614
Before we get started,

02:23.648 --> 02:27.284
I'd like to introduce you
to today's special guest judge.

02:27.319 --> 02:29.587
Last season,
she joined the <i> Face Off</i> family

02:29.621 --> 02:32.189
when she filled in for Ve
on the judges' panel.

02:32.224 --> 02:33.958
[all gasp]

02:33.992 --> 02:36.427
Please give a warm welcome back

02:36.461 --> 02:39.563
to Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

02:39.598 --> 02:41.832
[cheers and applause]

02:41.867 --> 02:45.169
Lois Burwell, makeup legend
and judge from season seven.

02:45.203 --> 02:47.404
She's known for her work
with Steven Spielberg

02:47.439 --> 02:48.839
and her realism.

02:48.874 --> 02:50.407
I'm really stoked
that she's gonna be judging

02:50.442 --> 02:51.942
our Foundation Challenge.

02:51.977 --> 02:53.811
- What a great hat.
- Thank you very much.

02:53.845 --> 02:56.213
It would be rude not to,
wouldn't it, on a hat challenge?

02:56.248 --> 02:57.748
[laughter]

02:57.782 --> 03:00.451
All right, well, you've seen it
all in your storied career,

03:00.485 --> 03:04.054
and you've brought so many
incredible characters to life.

03:04.089 --> 03:06.056
So what is it about a hat
that can make

03:06.091 --> 03:07.258
a character stand out?

03:07.292 --> 03:09.360
Well, the wonderful thing
about a hat

03:09.394 --> 03:10.895
is that it frames the face.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.398
So the hat complements
the makeup, the character.

03:14.432 --> 03:17.134
Be inspired by the hat.

03:17.168 --> 03:19.036
What are you gonna be looking
for in today's final makeups?

03:19.070 --> 03:21.805
Not only technique and skill,

03:21.840 --> 03:26.644
but more importantly,
a clean makeup.

03:26.678 --> 03:29.613
All right, we started
this season with 15 of you.

03:29.648 --> 03:31.949
(McKenzie)
Now only 10 of you are left.

03:31.983 --> 03:34.785
So winning today's challenge
and its prize of immunity

03:34.819 --> 03:37.421
means more than ever.

03:38.456 --> 03:39.723
(Rob)
Immunity would be fantastic.

03:39.758 --> 03:41.825
With me being in bottom looks
last challenge,

03:41.860 --> 03:43.027
it gives me the ability

03:43.061 --> 03:45.195
to try things
that I would never try before.

03:45.230 --> 03:47.264
Your models
and your makeup stations

03:47.299 --> 03:50.568
have been randomly assigned,
and on Lois's go,

03:50.602 --> 03:52.836
I want you to grab a hat
and get to work.

03:52.871 --> 03:55.839
You have two hours
for this Foundation Challenge.

03:55.874 --> 03:57.975
Ready, set...

03:58.009 --> 04:00.177
Go.

04:03.582 --> 04:05.282
- This one.
- Shit, this is heavy.

04:07.452 --> 04:09.219
Hey, let's see if this fits.

04:09.254 --> 04:11.655
I grab the poofy dandelion hat.
It's fluffy.

04:11.690 --> 04:13.357
I immediately think Dr. Seuss,

04:13.391 --> 04:16.360
so I'm thinking cute, like,
Whoville-style character.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.894
Yay.
Okay, let's go with that.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.934
Let's see
how this fits you first.

04:23.969 --> 04:26.103
Ridiculous.
[chuckles]

04:26.137 --> 04:27.871
I end up picking a ship hat.

04:27.906 --> 04:29.373
I thought I would make a pirate.

04:29.407 --> 04:30.641
But no ship's captain

04:30.675 --> 04:33.544
would wear a hat that looked
like a ship on his head.

04:33.578 --> 04:35.045
It's a silly hat.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.580
So I don't know what I'm doing.

04:36.615 --> 04:39.116
I guess I'll just make
a dead ship's captain.

04:39.150 --> 04:40.818
Arrgh.

04:42.787 --> 04:44.488
- I'm gonna make you all wood.
- Okay.

04:44.522 --> 04:45.956
A wooden boy.

04:45.991 --> 04:48.492
(Rob) I have the top hat,
and I'm really excited,

04:48.526 --> 04:50.127
because my kids will like
my concept,

04:50.161 --> 04:52.363
which is a dark version
of Pinocchio.

04:52.397 --> 04:55.599
Geppetto didn't save Pinocchio,
and he's still trying

04:55.634 --> 04:57.568
to find his father
after all these years.

04:57.602 --> 04:59.903
This is if you stayed in
the whale longer than expected.

04:59.938 --> 05:01.572
[laughs]

05:08.346 --> 05:12.449
I am creating this asymmetric
goddess-style character

05:12.484 --> 05:14.485
in a tin-foil dress.

05:14.519 --> 05:16.820
I picked a really big, busy hat.

05:16.855 --> 05:18.389
It's full of metal
and rhinestones...

05:18.423 --> 05:20.557
It's gonna get uncomfortable
kind of fast.

05:20.592 --> 05:23.527
So I start gluing
crushed rhinestones on my model.

05:23.561 --> 05:26.697
I want it to be more sparkly
and gold and silver,

05:26.731 --> 05:29.166
and on the other side, I want it
to be more blue and purple.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.968
Oh, gosh.

05:32.570 --> 05:33.637
(Kelly)
Give me your whimsical face.

05:33.672 --> 05:37.174
My hat is this cool toy,

05:37.208 --> 05:40.411
tinker, metal, old-school hat.

05:40.445 --> 05:42.012
It's just obnoxious.

05:42.047 --> 05:44.048
It's great.
[laughs]

05:44.082 --> 05:45.683
A little trim-trim.

05:45.717 --> 05:48.552
My character is, like, the
Willy Wonka of the toy world.

05:48.586 --> 05:49.853
You look so good.

05:49.888 --> 05:52.189
Five minutes, you guys!
You got five minutes left!

06:02.233 --> 06:03.834
Time's up.
Brushes down.

06:03.868 --> 06:05.369
Yay.

06:05.403 --> 06:07.871
All right, so tell us
about what you created today.

06:07.906 --> 06:10.074
So I wanted to go
with a smaller hat.

06:10.108 --> 06:13.911
I just made, like, an evil
Victorian queenlike figure.

06:13.945 --> 06:15.145
When you do a lip line,

06:15.180 --> 06:18.649
you will find
if you just put a finger here,

06:18.683 --> 06:19.783
and then work like that...

06:19.818 --> 06:20.918
Hmm, oh.

06:20.952 --> 06:24.188
You can gauge
the movement of the actor,

06:24.222 --> 06:26.156
and you'll get a finer line.

06:26.191 --> 06:28.192
- It's a nice makeup.
- Thank you.

06:28.226 --> 06:30.160
I thought, "What if
Pinocchio wasn't saved?

06:30.195 --> 06:31.628
What if he was lost at sea?"

06:31.663 --> 06:32.663
It's an amazing backstory.

06:32.697 --> 06:34.098
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.934
This section here, I think,
is the area that works best.

06:36.968 --> 06:40.604
But if you just added
some highlights going through,

06:40.638 --> 06:43.173
it would've made the whole thing
feel more three-dimensional.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.542
- Yeah, I agree 100%.
- It's a very nice makeup.

06:45.577 --> 06:46.610
Thank you very much.

06:46.644 --> 06:48.112
So she is
the emperor's daughter,

06:48.146 --> 06:50.247
and she has two sides
to her... a dark side,

06:50.281 --> 06:52.316
and then the other side,
she's more serene.

06:52.350 --> 06:54.284
This is a huge amount of work.

06:54.319 --> 06:58.021
(Lois) I like very much the use
and understanding of color

06:58.056 --> 07:00.290
and the transition
from one color to the other.

07:00.325 --> 07:02.025
- It's very well done.
- Thank you.

07:02.060 --> 07:05.095
So I've created
a nomadic warrior.

07:05.130 --> 07:06.630
I wouldn't have used
so many pieces.

07:06.664 --> 07:09.166
I would have concentrated
doing one thing

07:09.200 --> 07:10.434
extremely well.

07:10.468 --> 07:11.935
- But it is a good makeup.
- Okay.

07:11.970 --> 07:13.303
[laughs]
Thanks.

07:13.338 --> 07:14.972
Looking around the lab
is really cool,

07:15.006 --> 07:16.306
because people went

07:16.341 --> 07:17.708
in a lot of different directions
with this one.

07:17.742 --> 07:19.109
The hats were so different,

07:19.144 --> 07:20.878
and there's some
really interesting makeups.

07:20.912 --> 07:22.479
I don't know who's gonna win.

07:27.085 --> 07:29.686
Okay, Lois.
So how did they do today?

07:29.721 --> 07:32.055
Everyone did exceptionally well.

07:32.090 --> 07:33.557
I'm really impressed.

07:33.591 --> 07:35.058
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

07:35.093 --> 07:36.627
All right, who created
your favorite looks, then?

07:36.661 --> 07:39.630
Rob, I thought the work
said something

07:39.664 --> 07:41.665
about the simplicity of the hat

07:41.699 --> 07:44.134
being translated
into a simple makeup.

07:44.169 --> 07:46.470
- Thank you.
- Emily...

07:46.504 --> 07:48.972
you achieved
a huge amount of work

07:49.007 --> 07:53.677
and translated the hat
into that makeup superbly well.

07:53.711 --> 07:55.045
Thank you.

07:55.079 --> 07:57.648
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

07:57.682 --> 07:59.349
The winner this week is...

07:59.384 --> 08:01.585
[suspenseful music]

08:01.919 --> 08:03.086
Emily.

08:04.755 --> 08:06.256
[applause]

08:06.290 --> 08:09.860
You have an understanding
of color, form, and shape.

08:09.894 --> 08:12.095
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

08:12.130 --> 08:13.396
Emily, congratulations.

08:13.431 --> 08:15.432
As the winner
of today's Foundation Challenge,

08:15.466 --> 08:18.468
you have earned immunity
in the next Spotlight Challenge.

08:18.503 --> 08:19.536
How's that feel?

08:19.570 --> 08:20.770
It feels really good.

08:20.805 --> 08:22.472
Doesn't it?
I bet.

08:22.507 --> 08:23.473
(Emily)
I'm thrilled.

08:23.508 --> 08:25.075
It's exciting because who knows

08:25.109 --> 08:26.276
what the next challenge
could be?

08:26.310 --> 08:27.677
They're getting more difficult.

08:27.712 --> 08:29.446
Lois, thank you so much
for being here today.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.547
It was a pleasure.

08:30.581 --> 08:32.315
(Lois)
Oh, thank you for having me.

08:32.350 --> 08:33.817
It's a delight to be back.

08:33.851 --> 08:36.253
Nice work today, you guys.

08:36.287 --> 08:39.856
I will see you tomorrow for
your next Spotlight Challenge.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.758
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.994
- Thanks.
- Night-night.

09:01.412 --> 09:03.146
We arrive out to Canyon Ranch,

09:03.181 --> 09:05.515
and I am not much
of a nature boy.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.150
I'm not a happy camper.

09:07.185 --> 09:09.986
So I am looking out
for rattlesnakes, bugs,

09:10.021 --> 09:11.922
any of God's creatures
that could kill me.

09:11.956 --> 09:15.759
So I'm really looking forward
to going back to the lab.

09:15.793 --> 09:17.494
Does McKenzie always
hang out in the woods?

09:17.528 --> 09:18.828
[laughter]

09:18.863 --> 09:20.597
[sighs]

09:20.631 --> 09:21.598
Hey, guys.

09:21.632 --> 09:22.666
(all)
Hi.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.201
Welcome to Canyon Ranch.

09:24.235 --> 09:26.469
This beautiful wooded landscape
has been featured

09:26.504 --> 09:29.739
in a variety of television shows
and feature films,

09:29.774 --> 09:32.842
including <i> The Office,</i>
<i>Sons of Anarchy,</i>

09:32.877 --> 09:35.645
and my personal favorite,
<i>True Blood.</i>

09:35.680 --> 09:38.882
All right, let's talk about
your next Spotlight Challenge.

09:38.916 --> 09:42.018
Mankind continues
to be fascinated by royalty.

09:42.053 --> 09:45.121
Now, while royals
rule over humans,

09:45.156 --> 09:47.891
nature shows us
that this social stratum

09:47.925 --> 09:50.794
actually exists in other species

09:50.828 --> 09:54.464
that represents more than half
of all known living organisms.

09:54.498 --> 09:57.334
In fact, you may even have
a few by your feet

09:57.368 --> 09:59.169
at this very moment...

09:59.203 --> 10:00.704
insects.

10:00.738 --> 10:02.973
Oh.

10:03.007 --> 10:04.374
I'm feeling really pumped.

10:04.408 --> 10:06.743
I'm thinking about sculpting
little appendages

10:06.777 --> 10:08.878
and just nasty,
like, awesomeness.

10:08.913 --> 10:10.046
Deep in these woods,

10:10.081 --> 10:13.049
you will find
several elaborate habitats,

10:13.084 --> 10:16.753
along with an image
of a unique insect.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.455
Working in teams of two,
you will select

10:18.489 --> 10:20.357
an insect and habitat to inspire

10:20.391 --> 10:24.160
a beautiful insect queen
and her companion.

10:24.195 --> 10:26.730
All right, why don't you
go ahead and select a teammate?

10:28.232 --> 10:30.367
Did you just...

10:30.401 --> 10:32.135
- What's up, brother?
- [humming happily]

10:32.169 --> 10:33.937
(McKenzie) Now, before
you can get started,

10:33.971 --> 10:36.172
there is a big part
of this challenge

10:36.207 --> 10:37.741
that I haven't told you about.

10:37.775 --> 10:39.342
Oh.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.444
You're not gonna be working
in the lab this week.

10:41.479 --> 10:44.614
In fact, this entire
Spotlight Challenge

10:44.649 --> 10:47.150
will take place
right here in the woods.

10:47.184 --> 10:49.119
- What?
- What?

10:49.153 --> 10:50.420
Are we camping here?

10:50.454 --> 10:52.656
I don't really understand
what that means.

10:52.690 --> 10:55.558
So are we sculpting
in the forest?

10:55.593 --> 10:57.427
Models, come on out.

11:01.632 --> 11:02.799
(Rob)
Oh, God.

11:05.036 --> 11:06.636
[laughter]

11:06.671 --> 11:07.637
Um...

11:07.672 --> 11:09.873
Oh, God!
[laughs]

11:10.941 --> 11:12.409
Shit.

11:16.213 --> 11:18.315
Models, come on out.

11:18.349 --> 11:20.283
- [laughter]
- Um...

11:20.318 --> 11:22.118
(Adam)
This is new.

11:22.153 --> 11:25.755
So obviously, this is
a nude body painting challenge.

11:25.790 --> 11:27.390
(woman)
Yeah.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.692
Okay.

11:28.726 --> 11:30.760
I don't body-paint.
I don't need this now.

11:30.795 --> 11:32.662
- Rob, you all right?
- I'm all right.

11:32.697 --> 11:33.997
[laughter]

11:34.031 --> 11:35.432
All right, thank you, models.

11:35.466 --> 11:37.901
Why don't you go ahead and take
your places in your habitats?

11:40.971 --> 11:42.472
All right, now,
I know body-painting

11:42.506 --> 11:44.107
is a difficult task

11:44.141 --> 11:46.476
and requires
a very specific skill set.

11:46.510 --> 11:50.213
So I brought in an expert
to give you some advice.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.082
He's an award-winning
body-painter

11:52.116 --> 11:54.651
whose work has appeared
in <i> Playboy</i> and <i> Fangoria.</i>

11:54.685 --> 11:57.520
You may also recognize him
from season two of <i> Face Off.</i>

11:57.555 --> 12:00.957
Please give a warm welcome
to Nix Herrera.

12:00.991 --> 12:03.226
[cheers and applause]

12:03.260 --> 12:05.762
Nix knows body-painting
so well.

12:05.796 --> 12:08.565
I'm super excited that
he's gonna be giving advice.

12:08.599 --> 12:10.867
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.902
All right, so tell these guys
what you've been up to lately.

12:12.937 --> 12:15.038
I have a brush line
coming out for body-painters,

12:15.072 --> 12:16.773
and I'm getting ready
to do some work in Hong Kong.

12:16.807 --> 12:19.342
Well, for a lot of
special-effects makeup artists,

12:19.377 --> 12:22.846
body-painting is way
out of their comfort zone.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.414
So what advice do you have
for these guys

12:24.448 --> 12:26.549
to make a beautiful
body-painting?

12:26.584 --> 12:28.084
I think the first thing
is just remember,

12:28.119 --> 12:30.186
you have a full body
as your canvas.

12:30.221 --> 12:31.721
Take advantage
of this opportunity.

12:31.756 --> 12:33.523
And insects have
a lot of colors.

12:33.557 --> 12:35.125
Have fun with it.

12:35.159 --> 12:38.395
As a reminder, one of your
characters must be a queen,

12:38.429 --> 12:42.098
but the other could be anything
that you'd like, even a blend,

12:42.133 --> 12:45.702
where your model completely
disappears into the landscape.

12:45.736 --> 12:48.471
All right, guys, you'll have
5 1/2 hours for this challenge.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.574
Your coaches will be by soon
to see how you're doing,

12:51.609 --> 12:53.977
and Nix here will also check in
with you in a couple of hours

12:54.011 --> 12:56.579
to make sure that
you're all on the right track.

12:56.614 --> 12:58.114
All right, on "Go,"
you'll select your habitat.

12:58.149 --> 13:00.316
Make sure
that you choose wisely,

13:00.351 --> 13:03.019
as your final makeups
will be photographed

13:03.053 --> 13:04.554
presiding over their kingdoms

13:04.588 --> 13:07.090
for the judges
to see on the reveal stage.

13:07.124 --> 13:08.691
So, Nix, would you like
to do the honors?

13:08.726 --> 13:10.560
I would love to.

13:10.594 --> 13:11.895
Your time starts now.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.532
We all start running
through the woods

13:15.566 --> 13:19.803
like crazy people looking at
the different insect habitats.

13:19.837 --> 13:21.004
Jamie, you okay with this?

13:21.038 --> 13:22.539
- I'm okay with the honey bee.
- Cool.

13:22.573 --> 13:24.240
- You want ladybug?
- Let's do it.

13:24.275 --> 13:25.775
(Ben) You want to do
this, European hornet?

13:25.810 --> 13:27.143
- Yeah, or...
- We're doing it.

13:27.178 --> 13:29.078
Don't have time
to think about it.

13:29.113 --> 13:31.247
- Let's just grab it.
- Okay.

13:31.282 --> 13:33.416
Darla and me pick
the jewel beetle

13:33.451 --> 13:36.953
because its back is metallic-y
greens and blacks and blues,

13:36.987 --> 13:40.256
and I'm seeing pinks and oranges
on its stomach.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.459
This could be something
really, really, like, elegant.

13:44.495 --> 13:45.862
I'm Darla.

13:45.896 --> 13:48.064
Our models come over,
so we meet them,

13:48.098 --> 13:51.334
and we just start kind of
looking around at our habitat.

13:51.368 --> 13:55.038
So we'll just paint him
not to specifically disappear,

13:55.072 --> 13:56.773
but to match the wood.

13:56.807 --> 14:00.410
(Darla) Our concept is
to create a insect queen

14:00.444 --> 14:01.678
using our female model

14:01.712 --> 14:05.381
and then use our male model
to create a burned log.

14:05.416 --> 14:06.749
I think that'll look
really nice.

14:09.386 --> 14:12.489
Liberating walking around
in the nude, isn't it?

14:12.523 --> 14:13.651
[woman laughs]

14:14.525 --> 14:17.126
If you were to ask me
to devise a challenge

14:17.161 --> 14:19.028
that was my worst nightmare,

14:19.063 --> 14:22.298
it would be nude body-painting
in the forest,

14:22.333 --> 14:24.501
'cause I've never
body-painted before...

14:24.535 --> 14:25.935
Um...

14:25.970 --> 14:28.338
and I'm gonna have to explain
all this to my wife.

14:28.372 --> 14:31.808
We're gonna make you up
in probably those colors.

14:31.842 --> 14:33.142
We end up getting
the cuckoo wasp,

14:33.177 --> 14:35.311
and it has a very unique
color scheme to it.

14:35.346 --> 14:36.813
It's got greens and blues.

14:36.847 --> 14:38.448
It also has red in the abdomen.

14:38.482 --> 14:40.350
(Logan) She's the queen
protecting the larvae.

14:40.384 --> 14:42.051
You'll be embedded in the sand.

14:42.086 --> 14:44.220
It's really important
that this looks good on photo,

14:44.255 --> 14:46.389
because that's all the judges
are gonna see.

14:46.423 --> 14:49.893
So we really have to make sure
that we plan this out perfectly.

14:52.897 --> 14:56.866
Something I was thinking of
is painting, like, his back,

14:56.901 --> 14:59.969
so that it's,
like, the back of her.

15:00.004 --> 15:02.839
We choose the European hornet.

15:02.873 --> 15:05.441
I have this concept
that I really love...

15:05.476 --> 15:09.812
making the female the thorax
and the head of the queen

15:09.847 --> 15:13.283
and making the male model
the abdomen.

15:13.317 --> 15:15.218
(Ben) Well, I want to blend him
right into the background.

15:15.252 --> 15:18.821
I've seen really nice blends,
and now that I finally have

15:18.856 --> 15:21.257
the opportunity of doing
something like that myself,

15:21.292 --> 15:23.459
I'm gonna try my hand at it.

15:23.494 --> 15:25.895
If he's going to be
blending into the background,

15:25.930 --> 15:28.031
my piece is gonna be
the main focus,

15:28.065 --> 15:30.233
so she's got to be
pretty freakin' badass.

15:30.267 --> 15:33.336
And maybe turn
a little bit more other way.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.371
So how I'm
gonna pose her is having

15:35.406 --> 15:38.107
the back showing
this wonderful thorax...

15:38.142 --> 15:39.642
just reds and blacks.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.111
I'm not as in love with it
as I was my original concept,

15:42.146 --> 15:44.948
but I'm still
gonna make this work.

15:49.587 --> 15:51.654
(Adam) So it's the
queen of the ladybugs

15:51.689 --> 15:52.822
coming out of the leaves,

15:52.856 --> 15:55.091
but then
she's giving life to you,

15:55.125 --> 15:57.193
and it's all these larvae
returning to the earth.

15:57.227 --> 15:58.928
(Adam) I picked the ladybug
because it's an insect

15:58.963 --> 16:01.831
that we can make read
as a ladybug easily.

16:01.865 --> 16:05.401
I come up with this take
on the famous image

16:05.436 --> 16:08.705
of God and Adam touching fingers
from the Sistine Chapel.

16:08.739 --> 16:09.939
You're gonna see it,

16:09.974 --> 16:11.507
and you're gonna know
exactly what it is.

16:11.542 --> 16:12.809
(Adam) Do you want me to
start blocking her out?

16:12.843 --> 16:14.043
(Rob) Yeah, go ahead.
I'm just gonna start

16:14.078 --> 16:15.244
laying down the dirt tones
on him.

16:15.279 --> 16:16.779
I'm going to take the male model

16:16.814 --> 16:19.782
and do the blend work
for the ground and the larvae,

16:19.817 --> 16:22.619
and he's gonna start
blocking out for the ladybug.

16:22.653 --> 16:24.454
I definitely got to bring
my game to this one,

16:24.488 --> 16:26.656
because I was in bottom looks
last time,

16:26.690 --> 16:29.225
and I really need to step it up.

16:29.259 --> 16:30.293
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

16:30.327 --> 16:31.294
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:31.328 --> 16:32.395
Laura and Anthony come over

16:32.429 --> 16:33.863
to see what Jamie and I
are working on.

16:33.897 --> 16:35.898
- So you're doing the honey bee?
- Yes.

16:35.933 --> 16:37.433
We're gonna take
our female model,

16:37.468 --> 16:40.203
and we're going to make her
into the queen bee,

16:40.237 --> 16:41.571
and then we're gonna take
our male model

16:41.605 --> 16:43.072
and make him into a drone.

16:43.107 --> 16:46.709
We're gonna just really
enhance their natural curves

16:46.744 --> 16:50.213
and bring it into the honey bee
pattern, then coloring.

16:50.247 --> 16:51.681
(Anthony) Have you guys
thought about your poses?

16:51.715 --> 16:54.417
- Yes, we have a picture.
- Oh, okay.

16:54.451 --> 16:57.253
(Laura) They are going for
the feel of a honey bee

16:57.287 --> 16:59.822
with high contrasts
of black and yellow and white.

16:59.857 --> 17:03.693
It's a little bit more abstract,
which is the smart way to go.

17:04.962 --> 17:06.561
Ooh, what do y'all got?

17:06.597 --> 17:08.330
Did y'all already position them?

17:08.365 --> 17:09.898
(Julian)
Yep.

17:09.933 --> 17:12.568
(Logan) We're going to have him
as actually a larva with sand.

17:12.603 --> 17:14.170
(Laura)
So larva, as in worm?

17:14.204 --> 17:15.838
Yeah, with some kind
of pattern on his back.

17:15.873 --> 17:17.205
Do you have
a picture of the worm?

17:17.241 --> 17:18.775
- No, we don't.
- You're just gonna wing it?

17:18.809 --> 17:20.209
We were planning to.

17:20.243 --> 17:23.046
You may want to think about
the concept a little bit more.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.513
I don't want you going up there
and having to explain

17:24.548 --> 17:26.715
to the judges, where they're
gonna be like, "What is that?"

17:26.750 --> 17:28.184
Like, "Oh, that's a larva."

17:28.218 --> 17:29.519
"What does a larva look like?"

17:29.553 --> 17:30.887
"Oh, we didn't have pictures,
so we made it up."

17:30.921 --> 17:32.922
- [inhales sharply]
- Okay.

17:32.956 --> 17:35.391
I'd rather not change
our concept right now,

17:35.426 --> 17:39.095
but she does actually open
my eyes to other possibilities.

17:39.129 --> 17:40.697
Could turn him into the thorax.

17:40.731 --> 17:42.765
Or you could turn him
into the thorax.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.367
That would be pretty clever.

17:44.401 --> 17:46.269
The abdomen of this bug

17:46.303 --> 17:49.706
is in stark contrast
to the upper part of the body.

17:49.740 --> 17:50.807
I think it would be cool

17:50.841 --> 17:53.876
if we put them together
to create one bug.

17:53.911 --> 17:54.944
We'll start butt-to-butt.

17:56.580 --> 17:57.747
[laughter]

17:57.781 --> 17:59.449
Something like that.
What do you guys think?

17:59.483 --> 18:01.184
- I think we're good.
- All right.

18:01.218 --> 18:02.418
I like that.

18:05.789 --> 18:07.123
It's very straightforward.

18:07.157 --> 18:09.525
A lot of people are doing
some really creative things.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.561
I think you guys are
the only ones that are doing

18:11.595 --> 18:13.229
- just a straight blend.
- Yeah.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.997
If the blend falls short,

18:15.032 --> 18:17.767
you will probably be
the one that could be...

18:17.801 --> 18:19.202
- Going home?
- going home.

18:19.236 --> 18:21.070
(Anthony) I'm really
worried for Ben and Kelly,

18:21.105 --> 18:22.705
especially after seeing
everybody else's concept.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.540
The posing
that they're trying to do

18:24.575 --> 18:25.908
doesn't really tell any story,

18:25.943 --> 18:28.077
and their characters
don't interact.

18:28.112 --> 18:30.980
I want this composition to be
really beautiful, you know?

18:31.014 --> 18:32.682
Well, let's figure out
how those two

18:32.716 --> 18:34.751
need to be put together
so we can keep moving.

18:34.785 --> 18:36.686
I'm not really comfortable

18:36.720 --> 18:38.588
completely changing
my entire paint job.

18:38.622 --> 18:39.822
I just don't want to see
you guys in trouble.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.424
No, I didn't either, but...

18:41.458 --> 18:43.392
Well, changing it halfway
through isn't helping,

18:43.427 --> 18:45.194
so let's figure something out.

18:45.229 --> 18:47.730
I just...

18:51.260 --> 18:52.560
I just don't want to see
you guys in trouble.

18:52.594 --> 18:54.328
Well, changing it
halfway through isn't helping.

18:54.363 --> 18:56.998
Kelly's making
a queen European hornet,

18:57.032 --> 18:58.833
while I'm working
on the camouflage

18:58.867 --> 19:01.702
that I want to do,
and then Anthony walks in,

19:01.737 --> 19:03.371
worried about the direction
we're going in.

19:03.405 --> 19:06.507
And I think just shifting
a little slightly

19:06.542 --> 19:07.909
creates a better composition.

19:07.943 --> 19:10.912
All I can really do
is try to rotate them

19:10.946 --> 19:12.847
around the tree
so it's still utilizing

19:12.881 --> 19:14.649
the forms that Ben
had already painted,

19:14.683 --> 19:17.485
but also make it
just slightly more interesting.

19:17.519 --> 19:20.555
That is more interesting, 'cause
at least it shows some depth.

19:20.589 --> 19:21.556
What do you think?

19:21.590 --> 19:24.625
I have no idea, man.

19:24.660 --> 19:25.993
We got three hours left.

19:26.028 --> 19:27.195
I'm not completely comfortable

19:27.229 --> 19:28.696
with moving these models
right now.

19:28.730 --> 19:30.097
[sighs]

19:30.132 --> 19:31.532
Hopefully, that doesn't bite me
in the long run.

19:31.567 --> 19:32.867
(Anthony)
Just looking out, guys.

19:32.901 --> 19:34.368
I'm just a little concerned
about them getting

19:34.403 --> 19:36.037
everything finished in time.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.705
I don't want the members
of my team on bottom.

19:37.739 --> 19:40.641
I don't want them going anywhere
because of a boring concept.

19:40.676 --> 19:43.177
(Kelly)
Thank you.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.587
How are you brushing?
Are you patting?

19:52.621 --> 19:54.522
I'm doing a mixture of both.

19:54.556 --> 19:56.591
- You are?
- Patting seems to work.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.426
We're really excited
'cause we both feel

19:58.460 --> 20:01.162
a lot better about this concept
than the original one.

20:01.196 --> 20:03.164
At this point,
it's just on how we execute it.

20:03.198 --> 20:05.399
Being that neither of us
have actually body-painted,

20:05.434 --> 20:08.436
we still are a little bit
worried about pulling this off.

20:08.470 --> 20:11.472
Yeah, I brush it, and then
I pat what needs a little more.

20:16.245 --> 20:18.913
So, making him a log
and leaves and branches,

20:18.947 --> 20:20.181
that's a lot of work.

20:20.215 --> 20:22.850
Stephanie and Darla's concept
is beautiful,

20:22.885 --> 20:26.053
but camouflage makeups
are extremely difficult.

20:26.088 --> 20:27.288
Have you tried
different positions,

20:27.322 --> 20:28.789
or is this the first one
you tried?

20:28.824 --> 20:30.725
I mean, that was the first one
that we got to that made sense.

20:31.727 --> 20:32.406
Mm-hmm.

20:34.129 --> 20:36.697
I've already got
the base all laid out,

20:36.732 --> 20:39.367
but I know I'm not
a strong body-painter.

20:39.401 --> 20:42.670
Laura is really great
with concept design,

20:42.704 --> 20:45.406
so I decide to go
with Laura's suggestion.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.977
She's down.
He's still back here doing this.

20:50.012 --> 20:51.779
So our new concept is that

20:51.813 --> 20:53.514
we're going to use
our male model

20:53.548 --> 20:56.284
to create the wingspan
of the beetle.

20:56.318 --> 21:00.154
We have leaves
that we can... use.

21:00.188 --> 21:01.289
- Okay.
- Cool.

21:01.323 --> 21:03.024
I get the look of it,

21:03.058 --> 21:05.326
but I'm a little bit nervous
about the fact that

21:05.360 --> 21:09.230
these are dark, green,
opaque leaves,

21:09.264 --> 21:12.733
and we're trying to make
translucent wings.

21:12.768 --> 21:14.769
- What's your plan?
- I'm doing this.

21:14.803 --> 21:17.872
And then I'm gonna stipple
tinted latex over it

21:17.906 --> 21:21.642
so that I can get
the translucency appearance.

21:26.515 --> 21:28.316
Look straight, hon.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.650
I love the honeycomb pattern.

21:29.685 --> 21:31.452
I think that it would be
really neat

21:31.486 --> 21:34.588
to incorporate that pattern
onto my queen.

21:34.623 --> 21:37.925
It's risky, because
if it's not done right,

21:37.960 --> 21:40.494
it looks ridiculous
'cause it's so geometric.

21:40.529 --> 21:42.763
I'm nervous, but I feel like
I need to make her

21:42.798 --> 21:45.466
more interesting,
so I'm gonna try it.

21:50.005 --> 21:51.172
I don't body-paint,

21:51.206 --> 21:53.040
so I'm glad we have Nix
as our guest mentor.

21:53.075 --> 21:54.108
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:54.142 --> 21:55.409
So what do you guys
have going on?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.178
So we picked the ladybug,

21:57.212 --> 22:00.247
and we were inspired
by classic art.

22:00.282 --> 22:01.282
I love it.
It's a great concept.

22:01.316 --> 22:02.483
Thank you.

22:02.517 --> 22:03.985
With your stuff,
you're getting to the point now

22:04.019 --> 22:05.720
where I think
it's getting a little busy.

22:05.754 --> 22:07.822
So I think if you crispen up
a couple of spots,

22:07.856 --> 22:10.257
so there's a little bit
of depth, so it's not so muddy.

22:10.292 --> 22:11.826
Cool. Keep it up.
You guys are doing awesome.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.094
- All right, thank you so much.
- Keep it up.

22:13.128 --> 22:14.562
What are you guys
going for here?

22:14.596 --> 22:16.297
(Emily) We're gonna do a
queen bee and a drone bee.

22:16.331 --> 22:18.299
I love the colors
that you have going on.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.035
One thing that I found
for making the color pop

22:21.069 --> 22:23.637
is paint it with white and then
airbrush yellow over it.

22:23.672 --> 22:25.106
That'll give it more dimension.

22:25.140 --> 22:26.107
- Thanks, Nix.
- Good luck, have fun.

22:26.141 --> 22:27.108
Thank you.

22:27.142 --> 22:29.110
All right,
so the head is her head.

22:29.144 --> 22:30.644
- Is that right?
- Yep.

22:30.679 --> 22:33.280
I like it, and then
for all of the shimmery,

22:33.315 --> 22:34.782
reflective parts of it,

22:34.816 --> 22:36.050
I'm trying to figure out a way

22:36.084 --> 22:37.051
to get that
to translate into it,

22:37.085 --> 22:38.652
whether or not it's airbrushing

22:38.687 --> 22:40.621
or brighter color,
so that it has depth,

22:40.655 --> 22:41.756
'cause right now
it's just a little...

22:41.790 --> 22:42.757
- It's flat.
- Yeah, a little flat.

22:42.791 --> 22:43.758
Okay.

22:43.792 --> 22:45.559
And you have
the European hornet?

22:45.594 --> 22:46.927
- Yeah.
- You're doing the camouflage.

22:46.962 --> 22:49.363
I think I just want to make him
disappear as much as possible.

22:49.398 --> 22:50.931
(Nix) One of the things that's
gonna be challenging is,

22:50.966 --> 22:52.600
because the sun
is constantly moving,

22:52.634 --> 22:54.735
it's gonna change
the colors of your background.

22:54.770 --> 22:56.771
Every once in a while, come back
to your spot, photograph it.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.007
Yeah, I'm not gonna
keep you much longer,

23:00.042 --> 23:02.076
'cause you have
one of the hardest ones to do.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.544
- Kelly?
- Hey.

23:03.578 --> 23:05.079
- Hi, how you doing?
- Great.

23:05.113 --> 23:06.647
You are covered in body paint.

23:06.681 --> 23:08.149
Well, it happens.

23:08.183 --> 23:09.483
- The hair looks awesome.
- Thank you.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.218
I think the only thing
I'm a little worried about

23:11.253 --> 23:13.854
is how much actual paint
you have on the body.

23:13.889 --> 23:15.022
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23:15.057 --> 23:17.758
He's actually going to be
her wings.

23:17.793 --> 23:21.729
Is the color from her
gonna translate into him?

23:21.763 --> 23:24.298
(Stephanie) Mm-hmm. We want to
use metallic airbrush colors

23:24.332 --> 23:25.933
just to give it a shimmer.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.368
Yeah, try to pop those colors.

23:27.402 --> 23:29.003
- There's iridescent powders.
- Okay.

23:29.037 --> 23:30.104
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

23:30.138 --> 23:31.372
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah, keep at it.

23:31.406 --> 23:33.641
I'm gonna head out.
Good luck, guys.

23:33.675 --> 23:34.875
(both)
Thank you.

23:34.910 --> 23:36.444
Just give me a basic shape
to work with.

23:36.478 --> 23:37.478
I got you.
I got you.

23:37.512 --> 23:38.913
Adam and I decided
to switch off,

23:38.947 --> 23:42.149
so I'm going to add the
Kryolan aquacolors to the face,

23:42.184 --> 23:45.419
while he's adding the texture
of the larva on the male model.

23:45.454 --> 23:47.354
What color lips we going, Adam?

23:47.389 --> 23:48.589
White for the lips.

23:48.623 --> 23:50.458
Okay.

23:50.492 --> 23:53.427
Have you airbrushed
the shiny spots?

23:53.462 --> 23:57.098
I want to make sure Rob and Adam
both paint the larva correctly.

23:57.132 --> 23:58.466
To make those larvae pop,

23:58.500 --> 24:00.601
you have to create
a little bit more contrast,

24:00.635 --> 24:02.269
and add shiny highlights

24:02.304 --> 24:05.072
to make 'em feel
like some kind of larva bug.

24:05.107 --> 24:06.474
So it's kind of a dance
back and forth

24:06.508 --> 24:08.876
where you can see how it starts
to look more wormlike.

24:08.910 --> 24:09.877
(Rob)
Mm-hmm.

24:09.911 --> 24:12.580
[sighs]

24:12.614 --> 24:14.415
Darla's still
working on the wings

24:14.449 --> 24:16.050
that we're gonna put
with our male model,

24:16.084 --> 24:18.853
and I continue painting
our female model,

24:18.887 --> 24:21.789
and we're both frantic,
trying to finish our makeups.

24:21.823 --> 24:24.258
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

24:24.292 --> 24:26.293
It's a rough challenge.

24:26.328 --> 24:29.330
Because we spent so much time
working on our first concept,

24:29.364 --> 24:31.499
I don't know if we're gonna
have enough time to finish.

24:31.533 --> 24:34.301
(Darla) I'm just worried that
literally just his arms are showing,

24:34.336 --> 24:36.137
and we're gonna
get killed for that.

24:36.171 --> 24:37.538
- That's not good.
- Yeah.

24:37.572 --> 24:38.572
And it would be me going home.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.307
(Darla)
I'm not a body painter.

24:40.342 --> 24:41.575
This isn't what I do.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.445
To know that I could go home
for this is really,

24:44.479 --> 24:45.746
really frustrating.

24:50.597 --> 24:52.531
Literally,
just his arms are showing,

24:52.565 --> 24:54.800
and we're gonna
get killed for that.

24:54.834 --> 24:56.068
Okay, let me start airbrushing.

24:56.102 --> 24:57.603
Yeah.
I think it's time to airbrush.

24:57.637 --> 25:00.806
Because we spent so much time
working on our first concept,

25:00.840 --> 25:03.208
I don't know if we're gonna
have enough time to finish.

25:03.243 --> 25:05.644
But I've spent too much time
on these wings,

25:05.679 --> 25:07.880
so it's too late to go back.

25:07.914 --> 25:09.381
(Stephanie)
Just need some highlights.

25:09.416 --> 25:11.650
Yeah, and then I need to paint
the fuck out of these wings.

25:11.685 --> 25:14.753
One hour, guys.
This is Last Looks.

25:14.788 --> 25:16.155
Good luck.
See you <i> mañana.</i>

25:16.189 --> 25:18.324
Good luck, dude.
This is looking really nice.

25:18.358 --> 25:19.892
- All right, good luck, guys.
- Thanks.

25:22.228 --> 25:24.496
I got a lot of shit to do.

25:24.531 --> 25:27.333
I want to go in
with some more reds and yellows,

25:27.367 --> 25:29.668
get cream foundation
around the eyes,

25:29.703 --> 25:32.938
and just make sure
everything is painted.

25:32.972 --> 25:34.406
- More yellow?
- Yeah.

25:36.576 --> 25:37.910
(Jamie) That line...
Yeah, right there.

25:37.944 --> 25:39.545
It's too harsh
compared to the rest.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.046
We don't have much to do.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.282
We're just gonna add
a little bit more feathering.

25:43.316 --> 25:45.017
Jamie and I feel
really good about this.

25:45.051 --> 25:46.418
That looks cool.

25:48.254 --> 25:49.488
(Rob)
I've never done hair.

25:49.522 --> 25:51.056
I've seen my wife do it.
That's about it.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.758
Hey, we can just do this.

25:52.792 --> 25:55.828
So I hold my tablet up
as a mirror.

25:55.862 --> 25:58.130
Thank God for our model
to do this to her hair,

25:58.164 --> 25:59.231
or we would've been screwed.

25:59.265 --> 26:00.833
We're running out of time here.

26:00.867 --> 26:03.435
Ten minutes, everybody!
You have ten minutes left!

26:11.978 --> 26:14.480
All right, guys, time is up!

26:14.514 --> 26:17.249
I can't wait to see your work
onstage tomorrow.

26:17.283 --> 26:18.384
Go get some rest.

26:18.418 --> 26:19.885
[sighs]

26:19.919 --> 26:21.687
We're gonna get some time
to work with the photographer

26:21.721 --> 26:24.390
to make sure our models
are positioned correctly,

26:24.424 --> 26:26.759
but unfortunately,
we don't get to see the photos,

26:26.793 --> 26:31.330
and I'm really concerned that
our male model in underutilized.

26:31.364 --> 26:32.998
So we're just keeping
our fingers crossed

26:33.032 --> 26:34.500
that everything looks good,

26:34.534 --> 26:36.802
and tomorrow at the reveal
stage, we'll find out.

26:52.619 --> 26:55.921
Welcome to the <i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

26:55.955 --> 26:58.957
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.759
But before we
see your creations,

27:00.794 --> 27:03.095
say hello to our series judges.

27:03.129 --> 27:05.664
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

27:05.698 --> 27:07.499
- Good evening.
- Hello.

27:07.534 --> 27:09.968
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.037
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Ve.

27:12.071 --> 27:14.373
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

27:14.407 --> 27:16.008
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.

27:16.042 --> 27:17.242
All right, guys, so this week,

27:17.277 --> 27:19.611
I changed things up
a little bit on you.

27:19.646 --> 27:21.413
Your Spotlight Challenge
was to create

27:21.448 --> 27:23.348
two body-painted characters...

27:23.383 --> 27:24.683
an insect queen

27:24.717 --> 27:26.919
and a companion character
of your choice.

27:26.953 --> 27:29.721
Your creations were photographed
in their habitats yesterday,

27:29.756 --> 27:32.858
so let's take a look
at the final images.

27:32.892 --> 27:35.294
(Rayce) I've lost two
contestants in a row,

27:35.328 --> 27:37.396
but I still have
Adam, Logan, and Rob,

27:37.430 --> 27:39.965
and I think all three
of these guys have the chops

27:39.999 --> 27:41.233
to take it all the way.

27:41.267 --> 27:45.471
So I just hope their images
stand out onstage.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.591
This definitely looks
like a complete insect,

28:05.625 --> 28:07.893
regal, queenlike character.

28:07.927 --> 28:10.429
You almost can't tell
Armando's a person under there.

28:10.463 --> 28:11.864
I think it looks fantastic.

28:29.883 --> 28:34.553
(Darla) There's definitely some issues
with the position of the models.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.022
It looks like the wings are
coming out of the female's neck,

28:37.056 --> 28:38.290
instead of back.

28:38.324 --> 28:41.226
I'm really hoping
that we'll be safe.

28:58.711 --> 29:00.546
(Rob) The light isn't
hitting it right.

29:00.580 --> 29:01.947
It looks just like a flat image,

29:01.981 --> 29:04.550
and the earth tones
that I put on there

29:04.584 --> 29:05.617
are really muddy-looking.

29:05.652 --> 29:08.020
I'm really worried
about this one.

29:24.270 --> 29:25.804
(Emily)
We're so happy.

29:25.838 --> 29:27.973
Like, it just looks
the way we wanted it to,

29:28.007 --> 29:31.143
so we hope that the judges
like it as well.

29:48.428 --> 29:50.929
(Ben) I'm starting to notice that
there needs to be more darks

29:50.964 --> 29:53.432
in certain areas
and lights in other areas.

29:53.466 --> 29:57.069
I'm worried about this one.

30:00.807 --> 30:02.474
All right, judges,
why don't you take a closer look

30:02.508 --> 30:04.977
at the photos?

30:10.049 --> 30:11.617
This is really clever
the way they used

30:11.651 --> 30:13.085
that second body, I think.

30:13.119 --> 30:14.853
So smart.
The whole thing

30:14.887 --> 30:16.288
is one big illustration.

30:16.322 --> 30:18.890
(Glenn) There's a lot of
attention paid to creating

30:18.925 --> 30:21.593
a false light source,
and it makes everything pop.

30:21.628 --> 30:22.961
Yeah.

30:24.998 --> 30:27.966
So I guess their second person
must be the wings,

30:28.001 --> 30:29.568
'cause I can see the hand
on the outside.

30:29.602 --> 30:30.836
Right.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.071
It just feels
like it's an underutilization

30:33.106 --> 30:34.806
of that body.

30:34.841 --> 30:37.576
I'm really scared
because the wings may look

30:37.610 --> 30:39.544
just a little bit too high up,
or they're gonna think

30:39.579 --> 30:42.814
that we should've utilized
the male model more.

30:44.417 --> 30:45.917
Oh, don't be too harsh.

30:45.952 --> 30:47.619
It's my first time
body-painting.

30:47.654 --> 30:50.288
Ugh.
This is not good.

30:53.559 --> 30:56.128
Tell us who made your favorite
body-painting tonight

30:56.162 --> 30:58.964
on Twitter, using #FaceOff

31:00.780 --> 31:04.349
So I guess their second person
must be the wings.

31:04.383 --> 31:07.352
(Stephanie) I'm worried because
the judges are gonna think

31:07.386 --> 31:10.055
that we should've utilized the
male model a little bit more.

31:10.089 --> 31:12.057
(Glenn) I like the way
the wings are painted.

31:12.091 --> 31:14.259
I'm not as crazy
about the body paint

31:14.293 --> 31:16.194
on the featured performer.

31:21.034 --> 31:22.367
You guys understand what
we're looking at there

31:22.402 --> 31:23.869
with the second body?

31:23.903 --> 31:26.205
(Ve) I don't know what
that second body is.

31:26.239 --> 31:27.673
Her left thigh is gorgeous.

31:27.707 --> 31:29.475
You just don't see it
on the rest of the body.

31:29.509 --> 31:30.642
- Yeah.
- You don't.

31:30.677 --> 31:33.545
Unfortunately, I think
the ladybug is dreadful.

31:40.220 --> 31:42.287
Wow.
This is really pretty.

31:42.322 --> 31:44.223
Look at the striations
in her legs.

31:44.257 --> 31:46.992
I love the additional texture

31:47.026 --> 31:49.595
on her shoulders and chest too.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.533
The camouflage is successful,

31:54.567 --> 31:56.902
but it doesn't complement
the main figure.

31:56.936 --> 31:58.337
(Ve)
I love the colors,

31:58.371 --> 32:01.006
but I feel the fact that they
put that black muzzle on her

32:01.040 --> 32:03.675
is kind of not a good idea.

32:07.614 --> 32:09.648
All right, guys,
the judges would like to speak

32:09.682 --> 32:12.417
with each of you to find out
more about your work.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.320
Logan and Julian,
please step forward.

32:19.659 --> 32:21.927
(Glenn)
Tell me how your chosen insect

32:21.961 --> 32:24.029
inspired you
to create this body makeup.

32:24.063 --> 32:25.764
I observed that the abdomen

32:25.798 --> 32:27.866
had a starkly different
color scheme

32:27.900 --> 32:29.334
from the upper part of the body

32:29.368 --> 32:31.036
and it would be
a good opportunity

32:31.070 --> 32:34.906
to incorporate the second model
in that part of the bug.

32:34.941 --> 32:38.110
We had some guidance from the
coaches, Laura in particular.

32:38.144 --> 32:41.480
I fabricated the wings and
mainly painted the male model.

32:41.514 --> 32:44.416
I predominately took on
the female model.

32:44.450 --> 32:47.052
I think you were
incredibly successful.

32:47.086 --> 32:48.653
Thank you very much.

32:48.688 --> 32:52.090
This is a brilliant use
of the two human forms.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.525
I love the paint job.

32:53.559 --> 32:56.661
I love the coloration,
the iridescence in the legs,

32:56.696 --> 32:58.163
so I have to commend you
on that.

32:58.197 --> 32:59.498
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

32:59.532 --> 33:02.734
I think it's really
a very smart choice,

33:02.769 --> 33:04.436
the combination of the bodies,

33:04.470 --> 33:07.005
getting that inverse leg
with his elbow.

33:07.039 --> 33:08.473
Really, really good.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.308
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

33:10.343 --> 33:12.544
Logan and Julian,
if you please step back.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.150
Thanks.

33:18.184 --> 33:20.585
Darla and Stephanie,
you're next.

33:26.692 --> 33:28.827
Would you please tell us
what insect you had

33:28.861 --> 33:30.595
and who did what
on the character?

33:30.630 --> 33:32.164
We had the jewel beetle.

33:32.198 --> 33:35.000
I was focusing primarily
on the male model.

33:35.034 --> 33:36.334
I fabricated the wings

33:36.369 --> 33:37.836
and applied them
and painted them.

33:37.870 --> 33:40.338
I did most of the painting
on the female.

33:40.373 --> 33:42.007
(Ve) I think you
made a big mistake

33:42.041 --> 33:46.778
by not camouflaging
your model's breasts.

33:46.813 --> 33:49.548
They're accentuated, which
gives her a more human form

33:49.582 --> 33:51.483
than it does an insect form.

33:51.517 --> 33:55.120
The jarring thing
is really the wing placement,

33:55.154 --> 33:58.523
because it starts to feel like
it's more connected to her head,

33:58.558 --> 34:00.425
but the graphic design
feels good.

34:00.459 --> 34:04.563
It's just
some missed opportunities.

34:04.597 --> 34:06.264
Thank you.
Please step back.

34:10.937 --> 34:12.670
All right,
let's talk to Rob and Adam.

34:19.946 --> 34:23.547
Tell us how your insect
inspired this design.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.284
I thought it would be
a fun play on visuals

34:26.319 --> 34:28.652
to do the Sistine Chapel's
God and Adam.

34:28.688 --> 34:31.922
I did the ladybug queen.
I outlined the face.

34:31.958 --> 34:34.159
Rob came in and did
some hard lines on the face.

34:34.193 --> 34:38.263
(Rob) And then I laid the base
coat down for the larva itself.

34:38.297 --> 34:41.399
The ladybug doesn't feel
elegant or queenlike.

34:43.335 --> 34:45.837
I just can't get away
from the face.

34:45.871 --> 34:50.242
It has almost a Cowardly Lion,
kabuki hybrid going on,

34:50.275 --> 34:52.110
and that's a big problem.

34:52.143 --> 34:54.512
So have either one of you
been to a county fair?

34:54.547 --> 34:55.580
Not in a while.

34:55.614 --> 34:57.114
Okay, well,
you could've fooled me,

34:57.149 --> 34:58.516
because the face on the ladybug

34:58.551 --> 35:02.087
looks like a little kid's
painting at a county fair.

35:02.121 --> 35:04.756
She's a queen. You should've
made her beautiful.

35:04.790 --> 35:07.726
This is not working for me.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.694
Rob and Adam, please step back.

35:15.201 --> 35:17.836
Emily and Jamie,
please come forward.

35:24.110 --> 35:25.610
(Glenn)
Tell me about the insect you had

35:25.645 --> 35:27.779
and how it inspired
your makeups.

35:27.813 --> 35:29.948
So our insect is a honey bee,

35:29.982 --> 35:32.484
and our story
behind our queen bee

35:32.518 --> 35:36.021
is that one of the drones
have fallen in love with her,

35:36.055 --> 35:37.856
but she's kind of giving him...

35:37.890 --> 35:38.857
The buzz-off?

35:38.891 --> 35:39.858
Yeah.

35:39.892 --> 35:41.893
[laughter]

35:41.928 --> 35:43.862
And division of labor?

35:43.896 --> 35:46.298
Emily focused mainly
on the female,

35:46.332 --> 35:48.400
and I focused on the male.

35:48.434 --> 35:51.503
I think you guys
did a great job.

35:51.537 --> 35:54.072
The way that you created
an insect-y feeling

35:54.106 --> 35:57.075
with the broken-up panels,
it's a stunning final image.

35:57.109 --> 35:58.243
(both)
Thank you.

35:58.277 --> 36:00.111
Emily, I have to compliment you
on this queen.

36:00.146 --> 36:02.247
The face makeup is

36:02.281 --> 36:04.449
one of the prettiest paint jobs
I've seen on this show.

36:04.483 --> 36:06.451
Really well done.
Congratulations.

36:06.485 --> 36:08.253
(both)
Thank you.

36:08.287 --> 36:10.121
Emily and Jamie,
you can step back.

36:15.428 --> 36:17.429
Ben and Kelly, you're up.

36:21.634 --> 36:23.101
Tell us what insect you had

36:23.135 --> 36:25.203
and how it inspired
your creations.

36:25.237 --> 36:27.105
We had the European hornet.

36:27.139 --> 36:30.408
My original concept was
to integrate the second model

36:30.443 --> 36:31.643
to be the abdomen,

36:31.677 --> 36:34.779
but Ben was very driven
to blend the second model

36:34.814 --> 36:36.047
into the background.

36:36.082 --> 36:37.682
Now, Ben,
how do you think they are

36:37.717 --> 36:39.017
as two characters together?

36:39.051 --> 36:40.785
I don't think they go together.

36:40.820 --> 36:43.455
I really wanted to do
a camouflage pattern.

36:43.489 --> 36:45.156
I felt strongly about it.

36:45.191 --> 36:47.058
I have problems
with your female.

36:48.828 --> 36:50.962
Her face looks very animalistic.

36:50.997 --> 36:55.967
It looks more like a muzzle
than it is insect-looking.

36:56.002 --> 36:58.036
Did you guys work well
together on this one?

36:58.070 --> 37:01.906
We pretty much just worked
on our own, for the most part.

37:01.941 --> 37:05.343
(Neville) 'Cause it definitely
feels like you guys were doing

37:05.378 --> 37:08.346
two separate things that
ultimately work independently,

37:08.381 --> 37:12.784
but as a unit,
I just find it boring.

37:12.818 --> 37:15.120
I hate it as an overall image.

37:15.154 --> 37:16.588
I think there's some good work
within it,

37:16.622 --> 37:18.957
but here's the thing
about a team challenge...

37:18.991 --> 37:21.659
it requires teamwork to succeed.

37:23.295 --> 37:24.863
Thank you.
You can step down.

37:31.103 --> 37:32.470
All right, please head
back to the makeup room

37:32.505 --> 37:34.072
while the judges deliberate.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.847
Let's talk
about this week's makeups.

37:42.882 --> 37:45.150
Why don't we start
with Logan and Julian?

37:45.184 --> 37:46.284
(Ve)
I love the makeup.

37:46.318 --> 37:48.486
Really good integration
of the second character,

37:48.521 --> 37:51.122
using it as the abdomen
for the wasp.

37:51.157 --> 37:54.726
I think Logan's paint job
was absolutely gorgeous on that.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.294
They knocked it
out of the park for me.

37:56.328 --> 37:59.064
The thing that impressed me
the most was the fact

37:59.098 --> 38:03.501
that they had addressed every
square inch on both bodies.

38:03.536 --> 38:06.304
It actually looked
like exoskeleton plating.

38:06.338 --> 38:09.240
All right, judges, let's
move on to Darla and Stephanie.

38:09.275 --> 38:11.242
(Glenn)
This is in the middle for me,

38:11.277 --> 38:12.944
because it just
didn't quite get there,

38:12.978 --> 38:14.512
but it is not a total failure.

38:14.547 --> 38:17.115
I actually think that the
painting on the wings is superb.

38:17.149 --> 38:20.718
I felt that they didn't take
advantage of their second model.

38:20.753 --> 38:23.088
I saw it as lost opportunity.

38:23.122 --> 38:25.757
They highlighted
the whole bosom area,

38:25.791 --> 38:29.594
which was a mistake, because
that said human right there.

38:29.628 --> 38:32.464
All right, let's move on
to Emily and Jamie.

38:32.498 --> 38:35.166
(Neville) It's the graphic design
of this that makes it so beautiful.

38:35.201 --> 38:37.669
(Glenn) I really like the
composition of their photograph,

38:37.703 --> 38:38.870
and I like their story.

38:38.904 --> 38:39.971
The queen is gorgeous.

38:40.005 --> 38:41.940
(Neville)
And Jamie's execution

38:41.974 --> 38:45.110
felt appropriate
for a drone worker bee.

38:45.144 --> 38:48.179
Judges, let's move on
to Rob and Adam.

38:48.214 --> 38:52.183
(Glenn) Rob's responsible for that
hard line graphic to the face,

38:52.218 --> 38:54.018
which is the biggest problem.

38:54.053 --> 38:55.320
And it could have been pretty,

38:55.354 --> 38:57.989
but this was just
a hokey-dokey paint job.

38:58.023 --> 39:01.059
All right, judges,
let's move on to Ben and Kelly.

39:01.093 --> 39:02.894
(Ve) She painted a black
muzzle on this thing,

39:02.928 --> 39:04.429
which gave it
an animalistic look.

39:04.463 --> 39:06.431
(Glenn) Ben's camouflage
is more complex.

39:06.465 --> 39:08.032
I don't know
that I needed to see it.

39:08.067 --> 39:11.836
(Neville) He came into it adamant
that he was doing camouflage.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.738
This was not a team challenge
for them.

39:13.772 --> 39:15.773
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

39:15.808 --> 39:16.975
Yes, we have.

39:17.009 --> 39:19.010
Okay, let's bring 'em back out.

39:26.785 --> 39:29.821
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

39:29.855 --> 39:31.689
Logan and Julian,

39:31.724 --> 39:33.758
you did a great job
with your color palette,

39:33.792 --> 39:35.793
and we love
the unconventional choice

39:35.828 --> 39:37.462
to turn your two models
into one.

39:37.496 --> 39:39.430
Emily and Jamie,

39:39.465 --> 39:41.833
we thought you achieved
some truly beautiful forms,

a striking final image.

All right, Glenn,
which team came out on top?

So, Glenn,
which team came out on top?

The top team tonight is...

Logan and Julian.

[applause]

40:06.180 --> 40:08.247
The way that you used
your models as one

40:08.282 --> 40:10.716
is something
that could've gone really wrong,

40:10.751 --> 40:12.518
but you managed it
incredibly well,

40:12.553 --> 40:14.353
and you gave us
quite a provocative image.

40:14.388 --> 40:15.455
- Well done.
- Thanks very much.

40:15.489 --> 40:16.522
Thank you.

40:16.557 --> 40:18.357
Logan and Julian,
excellent work,

40:18.392 --> 40:20.893
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

40:20.928 --> 40:21.961
Glenn?

40:21.995 --> 40:25.131
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

Good job, buddy.

There was a lot of great stuff
going on in your image,

40:34.074 --> 40:35.575
but it was the queen

40:35.609 --> 40:36.642
that was the standout.

40:36.677 --> 40:37.844
I appreciate it.

40:37.878 --> 40:39.712
I win the body-painting
challenge,

40:39.746 --> 40:41.180

in my life.

40:41.215 --> 40:43.516
If I can do a body-painting
challenge and win,

40:43.550 --> 40:44.650
then I think I can do

40:44.685 --> 40:46.452
just about any challenge
on the show and win.

40:46.487 --> 40:50.022
All right, Logan,
you, Julian, Emily, Jamie,

40:50.057 --> 40:52.191

are all safe

room along with the coaches.

- Oh, shit.

40:57.531 --> 40:58.831
Okay.

That means the rest of you
are on the bottom this week,

41:21.889 --> 41:24.457
we loved
some of the finer details,

there were redeeming elements
