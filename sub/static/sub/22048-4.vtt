00:04.540 --> 00:06.420
Should I go find a friend?

00:06.460 --> 00:07.580
Could you maybe find Chris?

00:07.740 --> 00:09.200
Here's Chris.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.560
This is Chris.
-I am Chris.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.140
You have to get new friends.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.640
Hi! Thanks for last time.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.320
Hi.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.160
We were wondering if you
were already on a Russ bus.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.800
Sana wants to join the bus meeting.

00:24.320 --> 00:30.720
We have an advantage, because
we bought a lot of toilet paper.

00:30.820 --> 00:33.360
Toilet paper rolls are a waste of time.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.600
What should we do, then?

00:35.680 --> 00:37.660
Do we know any 97' guys?

00:38.040 --> 00:39.780
You guys have to hook up with them.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.220
What are you doing?

01:13.780 --> 01:14.920
Good morning.

01:16.340 --> 01:17.400
Did you sleep well?

01:18.700 --> 01:19.780
No.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.440
I had a nightmare.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.840
About what?

01:28.700 --> 01:32.788
I dreamed that you wore red clothes.
You were completely

01:32.813 --> 01:36.684
drunk and sang: "Tonight
it's allowed to be a whore."

01:38.060 --> 01:39.240
Really funny.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.680
It's you who said I should get a friend.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.860
Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.240
So what's the problem?

01:51.240 --> 01:56.240
The problem is that you don't
understand Russ time is a capitalistic..

01:59.020 --> 02:01.640
You know Sana said I should dump you.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.360
She said that.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.260
Yes.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.440
You couldn't manage
without me for one minute.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.800
You couldn't, could you?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.640
You couldn't..

02:21.220 --> 02:22.200
Eva?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.720
Hi!
-Hi!

02:28.720 --> 02:30.280
So good to see you!

02:31.400 --> 02:33.380
It's certainly good to see you, too.

02:34.180 --> 02:36.660
Did you get here now?
-Yes. I got an earlier flight.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.200
Were you sleeping?
-No, no!

02:39.260 --> 02:41.220
Should we get breakfast?

02:41.340 --> 02:45.380
Yes, we can. Are you hungry?
-Yes, I'm really hungry.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.164
<i>[Hey friend. I saw a
history test lying on the</i>

03:02.189 --> 03:03.564
<i>table here with a 3 minus.
Is it recent?]</i>

03:03.700 --> 03:05.040
I have to talk to you.

03:06.040 --> 03:12.280
I don't know what you think, but do you
feel like Sana fits in our bus group?

03:16.300 --> 03:18.020
Maybe she's a bit strict.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.800
She asked you to break
up with your boyfriend!

03:22.680 --> 03:25.740
But do you agree that she can't
join our bus? I talked to Chris..

03:25.760 --> 03:27.380
Hey! Sana was wondering something.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.200
How many rolls of toilet paper do you have?

03:29.840 --> 03:32.200
Do you want to
get rid of them or not?

03:34.160 --> 03:35.800
Eight pallets.
-Hello!

03:39.020 --> 03:41.120
You said you didn't
know anyone from '97?

03:41.920 --> 03:43.000
I didn't.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.920
He's in a bus with William.
-Is he?!

03:46.100 --> 03:48.580
Who's William?
-You don't know who William is?

03:49.360 --> 03:50.140
No.

03:50.320 --> 03:56.360
He's the most handsome and
coolest guy in all of third year.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.640
That is William.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.940
Do you follow Chris on Instagram?

04:32.780 --> 04:33.620
No.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.960
Do it.
-Why should I?

04:35.960 --> 04:37.760
So you can get to know him.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.080
I have a boyfriend.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.440
It's becoming a problem.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.468
You don't have to
hook up with him.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.744
Just get to know him so we can
party on the bus with William.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.080
You can say that
that is why you're doing it.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.880
Yeah, because he will
respect and accept that..

04:54.880 --> 04:57.740
Yes! So follow him.
-Give me your phone.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.020
Do you know what he's called on Insta?

05:06.680 --> 05:07.760
That's enough.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.720
When he sends you
a message, reply flirtatiously.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.400
Why would he send a message?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.920
Just reply flirtatiously
to his message, okay?

05:15.080 --> 05:17.220
I have to go. Bye!
-Bye!

05:20.780 --> 05:26.140
She resembles the lady from "Ã¥ndenes makt".
-I know. She's completely raw.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.820
Who is Julian Dahl on Insta?

05:50.940 --> 05:52.140
Don't know.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.440
He stalks me.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.900
Should we go to yours?
-No, we'll go to yours.

06:00.740 --> 06:03.575
Eva doesn't want to tell
her mom we're together.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.544
-Why?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.600
She's embarrassed of me.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.680
I don't want her to meet
you when you're lying in my bed.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.480
Okay..

06:14.700 --> 06:18.220
Then invite me home for
dinner together with your mom.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.220
<i>[Thanks for the likes. Never
had a stalker before.]</i>

06:19.340 --> 06:21.200
Huh?
-Huh?

06:21.540 --> 06:23.480
Invite me to have
dinner with your mom.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.640
Yeah, I'll invite you to dinner.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.260
When?

06:30.920 --> 06:34.840
<i>[Haha! Terrible stalker, be careful,
I'm standing outside your house.]</i>

06:34.140 --> 06:34.840
Now?

06:35.320 --> 06:39.100
Yeah.. Today, tomorrow,
on Friday, or next month?

06:39.100 --> 06:43.820
<i>[Haha! Freaky. Now I'm actually a
little scared. And turned on.]</i>

06:43.820 --> 06:44.820
Hello?

06:49.340 --> 06:51.440
Friday.
Yeah.. Friday.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.760
Who are you texting with?

06:57.460 --> 06:58.320
Vilde.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.280
The Russ bus boss.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.620
Russ bus boss?
You're not on a bus.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.900
She is, and it's really messed up.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.040
Stop saying that.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.240
You said that yourself last week.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.360
Yeah, maybe I changed my mind.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.240
Yeah, maybe you did.

07:16.820 --> 07:17.640
Okay.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.760
Guess who's invited to
party with the Penetrators guys?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.900
Are you for real, Eva?

07:31.480 --> 07:33.460
Check it out.
-William will come..

07:34.100 --> 07:37.340
That's so great, Eva!
Oh my god, you arranged this for us.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.220
"Penetrator party at Borkis' on Friday."

07:40.820 --> 07:44.620
"Can you bring some friends?
Are they hot?"

07:44.700 --> 07:45.980
Yes!

07:47.060 --> 07:48.220
Relax.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.260
Try to be cool.

07:52.380 --> 07:56.000
We have to get alcohol!
-Yeah, I'll ring the beer man.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.820
Someone else?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.840
What's wrong with the beer man?

08:00.220 --> 08:02.740
Are you looking at me?
Do I look like I drink?

08:03.620 --> 08:05.400
I don't drink either.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.420
What an awesome gang.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.600
I can take some wine from my mom.
-Can you?

08:10.960 --> 08:14.080
Can we share? I can pay
if you want.

08:14.260 --> 08:20.300
I can't take any from my mom.
Her wine is so expensive. So she puts it..

08:20.320 --> 08:21.440
Stop talking.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.880
You talk too much.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.420
Excuse me?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.000
Seriously?

08:40.360 --> 08:44.040
She can't be in our bus group.
She's completely psycho.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.760
Beer man.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.200
Yes please.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.140
We'd like some
beer for four girls.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.440
And hundred boys!

09:01.120 --> 09:02.730
Do we have to pay?

09:02.755 --> 09:07.584
We have a friend here who's called
Vilde, if she maybe can flash?

09:07.800 --> 09:10.740
So we don't need to pay in cash.

09:15.340 --> 09:20.540
Or maybe we can
get Noora to do it.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.100
No, we don't do that.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.240
Are you in prison?

10:29.040 --> 10:29.900
Fuck.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.800
What are they doing here?

10:38.820 --> 10:39.860
Hi!

10:47.060 --> 10:49.100
Wasn't it them who threw
her out of the bus group?

10:50.860 --> 10:53.920
Wasn't it them
who called you a slut?

10:56.040 --> 11:00.520
Don't go. I'll either get assaulted
by Chris, or killed by those girls.

11:01.140 --> 11:03.520
Okay. I won't leave you.

11:20.780 --> 11:27.360
His goal was to get a girl pregnant,
but then he found another solution.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.520
You're kidding! Is
that why you're called the Penetrators?

11:35.300 --> 11:38.060
William asked me if
I wanted to go outside with him.

11:38.100 --> 11:42.480
I think we'll hook up.
-Fucking hell! Go for it, you little slut!

11:45.740 --> 11:47.160
Little slut?

11:47.560 --> 11:49.300
Yeah, she's really slutty!

11:53.400 --> 11:56.440
No, no! I'm slutty too.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.300
Hello!

12:20.720 --> 12:25.200
Just talk about politics
with him or something!

12:39.300 --> 12:40.160
Hello.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.760
Hi.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.200
Are they like your crew?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.040
My crew?

12:50.040 --> 12:51.940
Are you on a Russ bus with them?

12:52.980 --> 12:56.140
No, I'm not on a Russ bus.

12:56.140 --> 12:59.360
I'm not going to be a Russ.
-Okay?

12:59.360 --> 13:03.580
I just think Russ time is really lame.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.200
Great, why?

13:08.540 --> 13:13.120
Because Russ time capitalistic
and governed by market forces.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.020
Great.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.000
You're a bit brainy.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.420
I like it.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.920
I think it's a little hot.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.520
You think it's hot?

13:43.860 --> 13:45.860
Drama!

13:52.520 --> 13:54.100
I have to go.

13:58.340 --> 13:59.440
What's up?
