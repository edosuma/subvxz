WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
-You know,
these online races

00:08.103 --> 00:09.379
can sometimes
be a little tricky.

00:09.482 --> 00:14.689
But I love creaming these
international dudes one by one.

00:14.793 --> 00:16.172
Sweden? Beat 'em off.

00:16.275 --> 00:17.793
Morocco? Beat 'em off.

00:17.896 --> 00:19.241
I beat off all of 'em.

00:19.344 --> 00:20.758
- What did you
just say just now?

00:20.862 --> 00:23.310
- Well, some of these dudes,
their technique is basically

00:23.413 --> 00:24.758
superior fingering.

00:24.862 --> 00:27.931
They finger pretty hard and
they've developed it over years.

00:28.034 --> 00:29.827
But I finger hard as well.

00:29.931 --> 00:32.931
I come first because
my fingering's the best.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.137
- Keep talking about beating off
international dudes one by one.

00:35.241 --> 00:36.896
The chat is going
crazy right now.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.206
-Well,
it's the fingering.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.551
The Japanese guys,
they're very good at fingering.

00:39.655 --> 00:41.241
- Let me adjust a
little bit here.

00:41.344 --> 00:42.482
You're a little off center.

00:42.586 --> 00:43.862
- You gotta do the thumb diddle.

00:43.965 --> 00:46.793
Not the thumb war diddle,
but rather the Tetris diddle,

00:46.896 --> 00:47.793
if you know what I mean.

00:47.896 --> 00:51.137
Oh! Oh! Wait, oh! Oh, no.

00:51.241 --> 00:52.586
Can everyone see that?
It's on my camel toe.

00:52.689 --> 00:53.896
-What the fuck is
going on in this house?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.034
The WiFi is so slow.

00:55.137 --> 00:56.310
I'm trying to get
some work done.

00:56.413 --> 00:59.068
Holy mother of hell!
What is that?

00:59.172 --> 01:00.586
- We're streaming
to the internet.

01:00.689 --> 01:02.448
- You're streaming your
vagina to the whole internet?

01:02.551 --> 01:04.448
- Doug, can you turn
off the screen, please?

01:04.551 --> 01:05.551
- I think it's frozen.

01:05.655 --> 01:07.586
- Jesus.
What is with you kids?

01:07.689 --> 01:09.206
Whatever happened
to living your life?

01:09.310 --> 01:11.551
You're on the
computer all the time.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.310
And now you're streaming your
llama foot to total strangers?

01:14.413 --> 01:16.000
- Strangers with tips.
- Strangers with tips?

01:16.103 --> 01:18.724
- I am in a cream fest with
all these international dudes

01:18.827 --> 01:19.965
and I was coming!

01:20.068 --> 01:21.275
- Doug, can you get
that off the TV?

01:21.379 --> 01:22.379
Please, turn the channel.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.379
- This is your home!

01:25.482 --> 01:27.758
- Get the remotes, Doug!
- What brand is this?

01:29.034 --> 01:30.655
Oh, thank freakin' God.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.172
-I don't know, it's
kind of spooky, Grandma.

01:43.275 --> 01:44.965
It's like colonial times.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.931
Do you think we'll have
to pee-pee in a basin?

01:47.034 --> 01:48.862
- Nora, the toilet still works.

01:48.965 --> 01:51.689
- What if we run out of food,
and resources, and water?

01:51.793 --> 01:54.620
And we have to resort to incest?
Like in "The Shining"?

01:54.724 --> 01:57.034
- You mean cannibalism.
- Cannibalism, sorry.

01:57.137 --> 01:59.413
- Nora, relax.
I love blackouts.

01:59.517 --> 02:02.103
It's like camping in your home.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.724
Whoa. It makes me miss camping.

02:04.827 --> 02:07.620
- You used to go camping?
- Oh, yeah.

02:07.724 --> 02:10.620
We used to bring the whole
family up to Toronto to buy

02:10.724 --> 02:14.413
illegal Chinese goods, like,
uh, the salted pressed ducks.

02:14.517 --> 02:16.000
We put them behind
the kids' back

02:16.103 --> 02:17.482
and they pretend
they're sleeping.

02:17.586 --> 02:18.896
- Grandma, that's not camping.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.724
- I just need
to get a good signal.

02:21.827 --> 02:24.482
- You're not. That TV
is, like, from 1974.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.724
- The subways are all down.

02:26.827 --> 02:28.448
I might have to
hang here for a bit.

02:28.551 --> 02:32.275
- No worries, man.
Make yourself at home.

02:32.379 --> 02:35.689
- Yeah, of course, Papa.
I mean, Wally. I mean, me.

02:35.793 --> 02:37.103
What?
- What?

02:37.206 --> 02:39.241
- I'm just--I'm not real good
at hanging with cool dads,

02:39.344 --> 02:42.448
you know?
- Mm.

02:42.551 --> 02:45.793
Hey, you want a drink?
Ever had port tawny?

02:45.896 --> 02:49.137
- Oh, she loves sports.
Toss the old pigskin around.

02:49.241 --> 02:50.413
- This one here is a nice one.

02:50.517 --> 02:51.793
- Oh, yeah, ports.
I love ports.

02:51.896 --> 02:54.551
- Yeah, but see?
We needed a good blackout.

02:54.655 --> 02:56.827
It's the perfect
chance to unplug,

02:56.931 --> 03:00.517
spend some time together,
stay off the computer.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.793
We can tell some stories.

03:02.896 --> 03:06.862
Like, I bet you were wondering
about this picture, right?

03:06.965 --> 03:08.413
- I don't think he was
wondering about that.

03:08.517 --> 03:09.689
- Uh, sure. Is that you?

03:09.793 --> 03:11.586
-Yeah, that's me.

03:11.689 --> 03:16.103
Growing up here in Queens.
Look at my face.

03:16.206 --> 03:18.448
Actually, you know, it was
super racist back in the day.

03:18.551 --> 03:20.655
- Oh, here we go.

03:20.758 --> 03:22.275
- I'm out.

03:22.379 --> 03:24.931
- What? Grandma.

03:25.034 --> 03:28.586
- What you guys don't know--
it was different back then.

03:28.689 --> 03:30.862
We were the only
Chinese family on the block.

03:30.965 --> 03:32.241
- You'll never catch me!

03:32.344 --> 03:33.862
-But I made
friends with the boy next door.

03:33.965 --> 03:36.620
- Stop! Put your hands up!
Pew, pew!

03:36.724 --> 03:38.137
-He
was my best friend.

03:38.241 --> 03:39.413
- Ow, you got me!

03:39.517 --> 03:42.000
-Until...
- Jimmy, get over here.

03:42.103 --> 03:43.586
- I was just playing with Wally.

03:43.689 --> 03:46.275
- You know better than to play
with these Japanese traitors.

03:46.379 --> 03:47.620
- I'm not Japanese.

03:47.724 --> 03:49.655
- Oh, get out of here.
Now, go on!

03:49.758 --> 03:51.344
- Wait, hey, what's going on?

03:51.448 --> 03:54.655
- Wally, come back!
- I don't know.

03:54.758 --> 03:56.413
- JIMMY'He's
just joshin' ya!

03:56.517 --> 03:58.413
You kids keep playing your game.

03:58.517 --> 04:00.000
- JIMMY'Glenda,
I'm not kiddin' around.

04:00.103 --> 04:01.655
I'm not kiddin' around, Glenda!

04:01.758 --> 04:03.310
- JIMMY'Do
you hear yourself?

04:03.413 --> 04:07.206
Everybody hears you.
You're embarrassing.

04:07.310 --> 04:08.448
- Damn, Mr. Lin.

04:08.551 --> 04:10.551
That's like the first
half of "Gran Torino."

04:10.655 --> 04:12.620
- That kind of shit
happened all the time.

04:14.344 --> 04:15.379
The kids in the neighborhood

04:15.482 --> 04:16.896
used to play pick-up games
in the park.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.827
-Me, me, me!

04:18.931 --> 04:20.724
-But
I never got picked.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.034
- Robert.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.448
- Michael S.
- Michael P.

04:23.551 --> 04:25.517
- Michael R.
- Mikey D.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.586
-It
was brutal, waiting.

04:27.689 --> 04:29.482
I felt like everybody
got picked except me.

04:29.586 --> 04:31.275
- Hey, I'm over here!

04:31.379 --> 04:33.344
-A kid
with a broken arm.

04:33.448 --> 04:34.655
This total nerd.

04:34.758 --> 04:37.482
- Seriously?
That dorkus over me?

04:37.586 --> 04:39.275
-One kid
just wearing a suit.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.344
- You.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.448
And this old man

04:41.551 --> 04:42.862
that just happened
to be sitting there.

04:42.965 --> 04:45.482
- Is that guy even
allowed to be around kids?

04:45.586 --> 04:48.620
-Finally,
I was the last one.

04:48.724 --> 04:52.931
And it was one spot left.
They had to pick me, right?

04:53.034 --> 04:54.172
- Cactus!

04:56.793 --> 04:58.896
- What the hell?
That's a goddamn cactus!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.620
- I was devastated.

05:00.724 --> 05:03.379
I had to just stand there behind
the fence and watch 'em play,

05:03.482 --> 05:05.034
having so much fun.

05:05.137 --> 05:07.586
Even worse, that fucking
cactus made a big catch.

05:07.689 --> 05:10.965
-Cactus! Cactus! Cactus!

05:12.689 --> 05:14.310
- Are you crying?

05:14.413 --> 05:19.034
- No. I'm just
allergic to the sun.

05:20.448 --> 05:21.965
Anyway, the game went on.

05:22.068 --> 05:24.793
The kid in the suit, he had
to go to his uncle's funeral.

05:24.896 --> 05:26.275
So the captain turns
to me and he says--

05:26.379 --> 05:27.793
- Wally! You're up!

05:27.896 --> 05:29.517
- Me? Yes!

05:29.620 --> 05:31.206
-It was
my first at-bat ever.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.517
I was so excited.

05:33.620 --> 05:34.896
- I got this.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.275
-And do
you know what I did?

05:38.379 --> 05:40.275
- It's a home run!

05:44.241 --> 05:47.724
Wally! Wally! Wally!

05:47.827 --> 05:51.310
- Uh, no.
That's not what happened.

05:51.413 --> 05:53.862
- Yeah, it is.
- Tell the truth, Wally!

05:53.965 --> 05:57.068
- Shut up, Wally.
- No, you shut up!

05:57.172 --> 05:57.965
- No, you shut up!

05:58.068 --> 05:59.172
-What the
hell's going on?

05:59.275 --> 06:00.517
-All right.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.068
The true story is I
stepped up to the plate and--

06:07.172 --> 06:08.586
-I was,
like, out cold for, like,

06:08.689 --> 06:09.931
45 minutes.

06:10.034 --> 06:11.448
- You know what?
Fuck them kids.

06:11.551 --> 06:12.827
And fuck the cactus too.

06:12.931 --> 06:15.068
- Probably be pretty painful
to fuck the cactus.

06:15.172 --> 06:16.034
Appreciate the sentiment.

06:16.137 --> 06:17.551
- He didn't mean
it like that, Dad.

06:17.655 --> 06:18.827
He meant, you know,
like, screw them.

06:18.931 --> 06:20.034
- I've gone through
something similar.

06:20.137 --> 06:21.241
I guess not much
has changed since.

06:21.344 --> 06:22.413
- Mm.

06:22.517 --> 06:23.482
- I've been the
subject of bullying.

06:23.586 --> 06:25.034
There was this one instance--

06:25.137 --> 06:26.620
- Yeah?
-It was very bizarre.

06:26.724 --> 06:28.241
I haven't told anyone
this story, actually.

06:33.689 --> 06:35.758
- Hey. Are you Korean?

06:35.862 --> 06:38.379
- Um, yeah, on my Mom's side.

06:38.482 --> 06:39.862
- Come with me.
- Okay.

06:39.965 --> 06:41.965
-Wait, your voice
was that low back then?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.689
-I was born
with a giant larynx.

06:43.793 --> 06:46.103
- Hey, guys. Nora, right?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.551
- Uh-huh.

06:48.655 --> 06:52.517
- Well, this is what we
do to fellow Koreans.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.862
- Wait, you're Korean too?

06:56.862 --> 06:59.206
- Why are you doing this?

06:59.310 --> 07:02.068
You're wasting food.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.310
- Come on!

07:04.551 --> 07:05.448
- Dude, what?

07:05.551 --> 07:06.862
That's just
Freshman Friday.

07:06.965 --> 07:08.206
- What?

07:08.310 --> 07:10.758
- Yeah, that's something
Korean kids do at city schools.

07:10.862 --> 07:13.137
It's like hazing,
a rite of passage.

07:13.241 --> 07:15.275
- I just thought it was
Asian-on-Asian bullying.

07:15.379 --> 07:17.655
- No. I'll show you
Asian-on-Asian bullying.

07:17.758 --> 07:18.862
Where's your Lazy Susan?

07:18.965 --> 07:21.068
I know every Chinese
household has one.

07:21.172 --> 07:22.827
- All right.
- Oh, snot rockets.

07:22.931 --> 07:25.379
You guys get trajectory on
those things, like SpaceX.

07:25.482 --> 07:26.482
It's out of here.

07:26.586 --> 07:27.827
I mean, I'm digging
the port tawny,

07:27.931 --> 07:30.586
but I know y'all
got the Remy Martin.

07:30.689 --> 07:33.758
Every Chinese function
has Remy Martin.

07:33.862 --> 07:34.862
- Not every function.

07:34.965 --> 07:37.551
- Oh, and Chinese people
love bootlegging.

07:37.655 --> 07:40.103
Is that a Sony or a Tony?
- Okay.

07:40.206 --> 07:42.551
-Korean people
love alcohol

07:42.655 --> 07:44.655
and the United
Colors of Benetton!

07:44.758 --> 07:47.172
-Ma!
- Grandma, I am half Korean.

07:47.275 --> 07:48.241
- We're reclaiming her.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.103
- And double eyelid surgery!

07:55.241 --> 07:56.206
- Almost. Come on.

07:57.931 --> 07:59.413
- Hey, Princess,
you want a drink?

07:59.517 --> 08:00.689
You're old enough.

08:00.793 --> 08:02.034
- I can't drink.
I get red.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.862
I get mean-spirited.
I throw up in my mouth.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.275
Got kicked out of Walgreens.

08:05.379 --> 08:06.758
- Oh, that's why.

08:06.862 --> 08:10.965
- But I will light one up,
if you'll let me do it inside.

08:11.068 --> 08:12.862
- I'm not lookin',
I don't see nothin'.

08:16.379 --> 08:17.724
- Dad?
- Yeah?

08:17.827 --> 08:20.448
No, no, no. You know
I never touch that stuff.

08:20.551 --> 08:23.206
- But why?
- Why?

08:23.310 --> 08:25.000
Because something really
bad happened to me

08:25.103 --> 08:27.827
the last time I smoked weed,
that's why.

08:27.931 --> 08:31.000
- What happened?
- Just something really bad.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.931
- You killed somebody for real?

08:35.034 --> 08:37.620
- No, but I did die
a little that day.

08:37.724 --> 08:39.758
- Dad, what happened?

08:39.862 --> 08:43.620
- I never told anybody
about this before.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.896
I was in college.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.275
My roommate, Mark, he was, like,
the coolest dude I'd ever met.

08:49.379 --> 08:50.793
-That dude? Seriously?

08:50.896 --> 08:52.517
-Yeah, obviously.

08:52.620 --> 08:53.931
Anyway, we're
going to a concert,

08:54.034 --> 08:56.482
and he offered me
some Mary Jane.

08:56.586 --> 08:58.896
- Hey, hey, hey, my man!
- What's up, Mark?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.448
- You wanna smoke
a doobie before

09:00.551 --> 09:01.827
the Doobie Brothers
cover concert?

09:01.931 --> 09:04.000
- No, I don't think so.

09:04.103 --> 09:06.517
-It's
straight from Nicaragua!

09:06.620 --> 09:09.034
- What does that mean?
It's good?

09:09.137 --> 09:11.413
- It's how you get your
chill vibes, cool cat.

09:14.172 --> 09:15.344
- Yeah?

09:20.896 --> 09:22.379
-And I did it.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.172
It was a huge mistake.

09:28.275 --> 09:30.379
And I paid for it
that day at the concert, man.

09:32.551 --> 09:34.655
I paid big time.

09:34.758 --> 09:38.758
- Ah, why are you standing up?
- I don't know.

09:38.862 --> 09:40.896
- I got so high, I couldn't help

09:41.000 --> 09:43.551
but stand up for every song
that they played.

09:46.344 --> 09:49.379
- Hey, sit down, man.
What are you doing?

09:49.482 --> 09:50.965
- I can't help it.

09:57.172 --> 09:58.413
- Yeah!

09:58.517 --> 09:59.724
- Wally!

09:59.827 --> 10:01.655
Oh, come on, dude, sit down!

10:01.758 --> 10:04.965
- Oh, Mark, I told
ya I can't help it!

10:05.068 --> 10:08.275
- It was one of the most
embarrassing moments of my life.

10:10.379 --> 10:11.689
- Shit!

10:12.931 --> 10:14.413
Woo!

10:15.862 --> 10:18.172
You guys are the coolest cats!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.241
- Yeah!

10:35.758 --> 10:36.827
-Uh, that's it?

10:36.931 --> 10:39.034
You just stood up a bunch?
At a concert?

10:39.137 --> 10:41.241
- And I haven't touched
that stuff since.

10:46.758 --> 10:48.310
- All right, I got a story.

10:48.413 --> 10:51.275
Have I ever told y'all
the one about my boy Thad?

10:51.379 --> 10:53.000
- No.

10:53.103 --> 10:54.793
So Thad was out one night--

10:54.896 --> 10:56.206
-This is the
same dorm room as my dad's.

10:56.310 --> 10:58.103
-- No, this is a new spot.
-- It's not.

10:58.206 --> 11:00.068
-All dorm rooms kind
of look the same anyways.

11:00.172 --> 11:01.172
Is that better?

11:01.275 --> 11:03.172
-I know this
is my dad's dorm.

11:03.275 --> 11:05.482
- Cool. Can I be
in the story too?

11:05.586 --> 11:07.482
-- No, get out of here.
-- No, come on, Dad.

11:07.586 --> 11:08.965
Let him do it.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.793
-Anyways, Thad brings
this girl home and man,

11:10.896 --> 11:12.482
is she a 10 out of 10.

11:12.586 --> 11:16.275
Dime piece, Michelin rated,
98% on Rotten Tomatoes.

11:16.379 --> 11:17.413
- Okay, we get it.

11:17.517 --> 11:18.413
-So she's like--

11:18.517 --> 11:19.827
- Do you mind if
I eat this burrito?

11:19.931 --> 11:21.241
- And Thad was like--
- Smells great.

11:21.344 --> 11:22.586
Is that achiote chicken?

11:22.689 --> 11:26.413
- It's actually barbacoa with
extra jap-a-leño peppers.

11:26.517 --> 11:27.482
Do you like anal?

11:27.586 --> 11:29.379
- Uhhhh...

11:29.482 --> 11:31.275
- Where's your bathroom?

11:31.379 --> 11:32.724
-Doug, what kind
of story is this?

11:32.827 --> 11:34.206
It's not even about you.
- Well, long story short,

11:34.310 --> 11:36.241
he got a jalapeño seed
in his pee pee hole.

11:36.344 --> 11:37.275
-Ow!

11:37.379 --> 11:40.000
- I can't get a signal
on my black box.

11:40.103 --> 11:42.103
I'm gonna try upstairs.

11:42.206 --> 11:45.413
- Anyway, thank you, Doug, for
that fully disgusting story

11:45.517 --> 11:46.724
that no one asked for.

11:46.827 --> 11:48.379
- What? You got one better
than spicy dick?

11:48.482 --> 11:52.103
- A thumb could tell a
better story than spicy dick!

11:52.206 --> 11:54.551
- At least I was in my stories.

11:54.655 --> 11:56.275
- Got a couple of R.L. Stine's
here.

11:56.379 --> 11:57.310
- I got a weird one.

11:57.413 --> 12:00.137
- Oh yeah?
Wait. How weird?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.689
- Weird.

12:01.793 --> 12:03.034
In high school,
I became friends

12:03.137 --> 12:05.275
with these two
kind of bitchy girls.

12:05.379 --> 12:06.172
- That was so good!

12:06.275 --> 12:08.379
- That was so mean.
He cried.

12:08.482 --> 12:10.551
- Yeah, but that's so funny.

12:10.655 --> 12:15.482
-We prank called
takeouts and 911, mortuaries.

12:15.586 --> 12:19.586
- I dare you to prank

12:19.689 --> 12:22.482
a phone sex hotline.

12:22.586 --> 12:25.103
- A phone sex hotline?
- Yeah.

12:25.206 --> 12:28.310
- I thought that was
for people 18 or older.

12:28.413 --> 12:29.551
Doesn't that cost money?

12:29.655 --> 12:31.206
- No, not at all.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.000
- No?
- No.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.655
- Okay, yeah.
Oh yeah, I'll do it.

12:35.758 --> 12:38.034
- Yeah.

12:38.137 --> 12:41.758
-Well, hello.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.862
Welcome to Warm
the Bed with Wilma.

12:43.965 --> 12:46.620
- Hi, is your
refrigerator running?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.275
-Oh, say
that again, stud.

12:49.275 --> 12:51.206
- Is your refrigerator running?

12:51.310 --> 12:53.379
-Are you
prank-calling me right now?

12:53.482 --> 12:55.793
- No.

12:55.896 --> 12:58.517
-Take me off
speaker for a sec.

13:02.517 --> 13:03.413
-Now, look, kid.

13:03.517 --> 13:04.827
You're not my
first prank caller.

13:04.931 --> 13:06.862
But, I don't know, I can hear
from your voice your friends

13:06.965 --> 13:09.551
kind of forced you to
do this, and that's okay.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.103
I'll take care of it.
Just put me back on speaker.

13:14.931 --> 13:17.103
You asked if my
refrigerator is running?

13:17.206 --> 13:19.103
- Yeah.
-It is.

13:19.206 --> 13:21.689
-Well, you better
go and catch it!

13:23.172 --> 13:24.517
-Do you
think this is funny,

13:24.620 --> 13:26.379
you little pieces of shit?

13:26.482 --> 13:29.206
- She said shit!
- You're a piece of shit.

13:30.620 --> 13:31.724
- That's so good, Nora.

13:31.827 --> 13:33.620
-No one ever
had my back like that.

13:33.724 --> 13:35.310
- Wait, how much
a minute was this?

13:35.413 --> 13:37.758
- Not a lot.
Like, $30 a minute.

13:37.862 --> 13:38.931
- What?

13:39.034 --> 13:40.620
- We'd only talk in
4-hour increments.

13:40.724 --> 13:42.034
- Jesus Christ!

13:42.137 --> 13:44.931
I mean--that explains the
phone bill that I have not yet

13:45.034 --> 13:46.517
financially recovered from.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.413
- Dad, is this story
night or guilt night?

13:49.517 --> 13:51.034
Anyway, I called her back.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.517
- You got her home
number, right?

13:52.620 --> 13:54.275
- No, just still on hotline.

13:54.379 --> 13:57.413
- Holy shit, do I look
like Con Edison to you?

13:57.517 --> 13:58.586
-I let you finish.

13:58.689 --> 14:00.586
I even let Doug kind
of finish the Thad one!

14:00.689 --> 14:01.862
- Sorry.

14:01.965 --> 14:04.344
- We ended up
getting pretty close.

14:04.448 --> 14:08.517
Is it normal for my period
to last 11 or more days?

14:08.620 --> 14:10.448
And, do you think you
could lose your virginity

14:10.551 --> 14:14.206
to a super plus tampon?
Because they're humongous.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.896
-Nora, don't stress.
Just make sure you eat well

14:17.000 --> 14:18.965
and keep hydrated
during your period.

14:19.068 --> 14:21.172
And no, a tampon shouldn't.

14:21.275 --> 14:24.068
But here's a fun
tip: when peeing,

14:24.172 --> 14:26.689
go ahead and pull that
string towards your butthole.

14:26.793 --> 14:28.689
Not too hard so it slips out.

14:28.793 --> 14:32.655
- Oh man, that's genius.
I hadn't even thought of that.

14:32.758 --> 14:35.172
Puberty sucks, Wilma.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.517
Like, my friends make fun of
me 'cuz I don't shave my legs.

14:37.620 --> 14:41.206
My gym teacher had mentioned
that if--if--when you do start

14:41.310 --> 14:44.448
shaving your legs super young,
they grow back real coarse like

14:44.551 --> 14:47.241
Tom Selleck's
butthole hair, you know?

14:47.344 --> 14:50.379
-You don't need to
shave if you don't wanna shave!

14:50.482 --> 14:52.724
I know a lot of guys who
like natural beauties anyway.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.103
- Do you not shave?

14:54.206 --> 14:55.965
-Oh, no, my vagina's
balder than an eagle.

14:56.068 --> 14:58.206
Looks like Stone Cold
Steve Austin's foreskin.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.413
- Oh, cool. I love him.

15:00.517 --> 15:02.000
Um, happy holidays.

15:02.103 --> 15:04.034
-Happy
holidays to you, honey.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.965
- I love you, Wilma.
-I love you too, Nora.

15:07.068 --> 15:08.862
Don't forget to
yank that tampon out.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.206
It's been, like, six hours.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.758
- Oh yeah. No, I won't.

15:11.862 --> 15:13.379
-Bye, baby.
- Bye.

15:15.517 --> 15:17.689
- So you talked to a total
stranger about your period?

15:17.793 --> 15:20.620
- Sounds like you were having an
affair with a phone sex operator

15:20.724 --> 15:22.068
while you were in high school.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.517
You a G, Nora.
That's some good shit.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.482
- No, it wasn't
sexual, like, at all.

15:25.586 --> 15:26.689
- Yeah, right.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.000
It wasn't sexual talking
to a phone sex operator?

15:29.103 --> 15:31.068
Every day?
- Every day.

15:31.172 --> 15:32.655
- It wasn't sexual, Doug.

15:32.758 --> 15:34.000
- Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.

15:34.103 --> 15:37.275
- I just wanted a mom!

15:37.379 --> 15:39.724
-Hey!
I finally got a signal!

15:39.827 --> 15:44.034
It's snowy, but
I got the Spice Channel! Ha, ha!

15:44.137 --> 15:45.620
- Okay, it's time for me to go.

15:57.103 --> 15:59.793
- You don't talk
about her a lot.

15:59.896 --> 16:03.379
But I know you miss her.

16:03.482 --> 16:05.241
- I've come to
terms with it, Dad.

16:08.310 --> 16:11.068
- Do you remember her?
- In fragments.

16:14.517 --> 16:16.827
Do you?

16:16.931 --> 16:19.827
- Do I remember her?

16:19.931 --> 16:21.448
Every day.

16:23.034 --> 16:26.275
I'll never forget the
first time I saw her.

16:26.379 --> 16:28.103
I was walking home one night.

16:28.206 --> 16:31.758
I don't even remember
exactly where I was.

16:31.862 --> 16:35.206
Just that...all of a sudden,

16:35.310 --> 16:37.482
it seemed like time stood still.

16:39.931 --> 16:43.620
Frozen.

16:43.724 --> 16:45.413
She stopped time.

16:49.862 --> 16:54.482
You know, I have these
dreams where she comes back.

16:54.586 --> 16:58.379
And my first reaction is,
I'm kind of mad at her.

17:01.034 --> 17:04.137
I'm angry at her for leaving.

17:04.241 --> 17:05.655
In my dreams,
I start arguing with her.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.758
I ask her, "Why did
you leave us like that?"

17:14.517 --> 17:16.724
I know we don't talk
about her a lot.

17:21.586 --> 17:23.965
And...

17:24.068 --> 17:25.793
- I miss her every day.

17:29.586 --> 17:31.275
- Me too, Princess.

17:39.206 --> 17:43.379
- Do you think she'd be proud...

17:43.482 --> 17:45.344
of how I am now?

17:45.448 --> 17:46.827
- Did I ever tell you the story

17:46.931 --> 17:50.448
about how your mom
went to a psychic?

17:50.551 --> 17:53.034
She just found out
that she was sick and...

17:53.137 --> 17:54.620
she was pregnant with you.

17:54.724 --> 17:58.517
We didn't know the sex of the
baby or anything like that yet.

17:59.827 --> 18:02.620
But your mom goes
to this psychic.

18:02.724 --> 18:06.586
And the psychic says,
"You're gonna have a daughter."

18:06.689 --> 18:11.206
Like, she knew you
was gonna be a daughter.

18:11.310 --> 18:13.068
Spooky stuff.

18:13.172 --> 18:15.551
- Could've been a couple things.

18:15.655 --> 18:19.551
- And she says...

18:19.655 --> 18:22.413
"Your daughter's gonna be
somebody special someday."

18:26.275 --> 18:29.689
- You think this
psychic will be right?

18:29.793 --> 18:33.862
- Come on, she already is.

18:33.965 --> 18:35.724
- I'm really glad
you found Brenda.

18:42.517 --> 18:44.689
- Yeah?

18:58.655 --> 19:02.000
-Okay, it's the
return of the llama foot.

19:02.103 --> 19:06.206
I'm just gonna sit here and
polish off this bottle, I guess.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.275
You should go up to bed, huh?

19:12.172 --> 19:15.068
- I'll hang out
for a little bit.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.827
Stay with you.

19:18.275 --> 19:19.655
- Okay.

19:22.655 --> 19:26.931
- It's not that bad.
- It's pretty bad.

19:27.034 --> 19:29.793
- I really like the
story on this one.

19:29.896 --> 19:33.655
How do you think he's gonna
make her pay for that pizza?

19:33.758 --> 19:36.724
- Well, I got an idea.
- He's really good at that.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.379
- Yeah, they don't make
porn like this nowadays.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.551
Everything's all so
scary and aggressive.

19:41.655 --> 19:44.551
- Back then,
everyone was natural.

19:44.655 --> 19:49.517
You see a boob flopping around
or a big-ole Furby down there.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.758
- Those titties are flying
around like nunchucks.

19:51.862 --> 19:54.931
She's really got a
ZZ Top situation down there.

19:55.034 --> 19:57.310
Oh, an ad for
The Erogenous Zone.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.931
Adult shopping for grown-ups.

19:59.034 --> 20:00.620
- I got a pressure
cooker from them once.

20:00.724 --> 20:01.620
- What?

20:01.724 --> 20:03.862
- Yeah, they sold
normal stuff too.

20:03.965 --> 20:05.275
I have one in the kitchen.

20:05.379 --> 20:07.379
It makes moaning
sounds when it's done.

20:07.482 --> 20:09.275
-You guys know the
lights are back on, right?

20:12.275 --> 20:14.103
- Are you watching
a porno together!
