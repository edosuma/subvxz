WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:09.610
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.613
WE'RE GOING TO MISS THE COUNCIL
PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.148
I'M TRYING. MY
KEY'S NOT WORKING.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.250
WAIT, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
MY DAD WAS A LOCKSMITH.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.692
UM, DID HE ALSO HAVE A
GLASS-REPAIR BUSINESS ON THE SIDE?

00:26.060 --> 00:28.162
WHAT ARE YOU BREAKING
INTO YOUR OWN HOUSE FOR?!

00:28.196 --> 00:30.664
- MY KEY DIDN'T WORK!
- OH, I PUT A DEADBOLT ON THE DOOR.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.401
YOU'RE A PUBLIC FIGURE. WE NEED
BETTER SECURITY AROUND HERE.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.604
- YOUR NEW KEYS.
- THANKS, JUST IN TIME.

00:36.637 --> 00:41.008
BY THE WAY, STEPHANIE BREACHED
YOUR PERIMETER WITH HER PURSE.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.345
FIRST SWING! POP!

00:44.378 --> 00:47.615
- ( hip-hop music from TV )
- LENNOX, WHAT IS THIS?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.650
OH, IT'S AWESOME. YOU
WANT TO PLAY WITH ME?

00:49.683 --> 00:51.685
- IT'S A GAME CALLED "JUST DANCE."
- WE NEED THE TV.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.587
- JUST MOVE.
- YOU CAN'T.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.757
- AND YET...
- ( music stops )

00:58.359 --> 01:00.628
WATCH, THIS IS ONE OF THE
GREATEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE

01:00.661 --> 01:03.597
THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT
IN FRONT OF MINORS.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.633
YOUR AUNT WAS THE DRIVING FORCE

01:05.666 --> 01:07.601
OF THE NEW HUMANE
ANIMAL SHELTER PROJECT,

01:07.635 --> 01:09.370
AND THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT'S
ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT

01:09.403 --> 01:11.172
HOW AWESOME AND WONDERFUL
AND KIND AND GENEROUS...

01:11.205 --> 01:13.207
SHUT IT, IT'S ON!

01:13.241 --> 01:14.708
Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen, for being here.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.211
We're here to announce that the
city is committing funding

01:17.245 --> 01:20.681
for two new animal
shelters here in Toledo!

01:20.714 --> 01:22.383
( applause from TV )

01:22.416 --> 01:25.219
I'd like to thank, naturally,
my beautiful wife Sylvia,

01:25.253 --> 01:28.156
my staff members
Erica and Martin,

01:28.189 --> 01:30.291
and of course the little dynamo

01:30.324 --> 01:32.593
who was the inspiration
for it all...

01:32.626 --> 01:33.761
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.198
LITTLE DYNAMO... THAT
COULD BE MY RAP NAME.

01:37.231 --> 01:41.202
...my dog Poncho.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.604
AND...?!

01:43.637 --> 01:46.207
- I THINK HE'S ALL DONE, MEL.
- NO HE'S NOT DONE. HE CAN'T BE DONE.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.376
- THAT CAN'T BE IT!
- Well, that's it.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.744
- Thanks, everybody.
- ( Poncho barking )

01:50.778 --> 01:54.415
HE THANKED HIS DOG?! WHAT DOES A DOG
HAVE TO DO WITH AN ANIMAL SHELTER?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.584
OH, THIS BITES!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.819
AUNT MEL, YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD REALLY TAKE YOUR MIND

01:58.852 --> 02:01.088
OFF THIS TERRIBLE
TERRIBLE INJUSTICE?

02:01.121 --> 02:04.725
( hip-hop music playing )
♪ Who let the dogs out?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.560
♪ Woof woof woof woof ♪

02:06.594 --> 02:09.163
- ♪ Who let the dogs out? ♪
- STEPHANIE, SMASH THE TV.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.681
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO BE
SEEN AS THE CHAMPION OF ANIMALS,

02:27.715 --> 02:29.417
INSTEAD OF... YOU KNOW.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.719
THE DUCK PUNISHER.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.522
YOU WANNA UNPACK
THAT ONE FOR ME?

02:34.555 --> 02:35.656
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY FUNNY...

02:36.690 --> 02:39.260
IN A WAY THAT'S
NOT FUNNY AT ALL.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.661
UNLESS YOU HATE DUCKS.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.431
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST DUCKS!
THEY'RE CUTE.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.733
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.368
AUNT MEL WAS ON THIS
BOAT WHERE EVERYBODY

02:47.401 --> 02:48.869
WAS CELEBRATING THE
CLEAN-UP OF THE LAKE,

02:48.902 --> 02:50.604
WHEN A DUCK FLEW RIGHT AT HER.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.640
I BARELY TAPPED IT WITH MY OAR.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.907
YOU'D THINK SOMETHING

02:53.941 --> 02:55.809
CALLED A DUCK WOULD
KNOW HOW TO...

02:55.843 --> 02:59.613
SEE? NOT SO HARD.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.149
YEAH, THERE WERE BLOODY FEATHERS
AND DUCK BITS EVERYWHERE.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.319
AND HER APPROVAL
RATING WENT BYOOOMP.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.622
ONE QUESTION: WHEN THIS
TRAGIC INCIDENT OCCURRED,

03:08.656 --> 03:12.360
WAS IT DUCK SEASON
OR WABBIT SEASON?

03:13.661 --> 03:16.397
I WAS COUNTING ON THE P.R.
SPIN FROM THE ANIMAL SHELTER

03:16.430 --> 03:18.566
TO HELP ME OUT, BUT NOW
WE'RE BACK AT SQUARE ONE.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.734
AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
THERE ISN'T A SQUARE ZERO.

03:20.768 --> 03:24.705
YOU NEED TO BE SEEN ON
TV DOING SOMETHING GOOD.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.709
OH RIGHT, THAT'S MY JOB.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.678
I COULD CALL MY FRIEND
AT "TOLEDO TODAY."

03:30.711 --> 03:32.780
OH, THAT IDIOTIC SHOW?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.283
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN ONE
OF THOSE VAPID PUFF PIECES.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.685
EVERYBODY WATCHES IT.
BIG NUMBERS.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.287
I LOVE THAT SHOW. START DIALING.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.721
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE, BURKE.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.256
WHEN THINGS BLEW UP
AT SCANLON TRUST,

03:42.290 --> 03:44.325
THOSE NEWS PEOPLE TWISTED
EVERYTHING I SAID AROUND.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.394
ONE REPORTER GETS ONE
SOUND BITE OF YOU SAYING,

03:46.427 --> 03:47.628
"I'M GOING TO MISS MY PORSCHE,"

03:47.661 --> 03:49.630
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE
ALL OVER THE INTERNET

03:49.663 --> 03:52.700
- AS THE DOUCHY I'M-GOING-TO-MISS-MY-PORSCHE GUY.
- ( scoffs ) PLEASE.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.835
LOOK I'M NOT AN AMATEUR.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.737
I'M THE SPINMEISTER.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.607
I'LL INVITE THEM OVER TO MY
OFFICE, THEY'LL INTERVIEW ME

03:59.640 --> 04:01.975
AND THEY'LL EAT A TINY LITTLE
MESSAGE OUT OF MY HAND.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.812
OH HERE. HERE'S A TINY LITTLE MESSAGE.
NUM, NUM, NUM, NUM.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.782
IT AIN'T THAT EASY, BURKE.
YOU CAN'T SCRIPT EVERYTHING.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.217
NUM NUM.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.720
STEPHANIE, GET
THEM ON THE PHONE.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.988
HERE'S THE HEADLINE: "MEL BURKE:

04:15.022 --> 04:17.658
THE SENATOR'S PARTY-GIRL
DAUGHTER HAS TRANSFORMED HERSELF

04:17.691 --> 04:19.660
AND IS BRINGING MAJOR
CHANGE TO TOLEDO."

04:19.693 --> 04:23.364
BY REDUCING THE DUCK POPULATION?

04:23.397 --> 04:26.800
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, MAN. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO ME, IT'S NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.310
Stephanie, I've made some
changes to Tuesday's speech

04:36.344 --> 04:38.312
to the Hispanic Society.

04:38.346 --> 04:42.883
Make sure we thank todas en
la iglesia para las Flores.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.985
When did you ever have
the time to do this?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.887
Do you ever sleep?

04:46.920 --> 04:50.458
The city's problems never sleep.
How can I?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.626
Cut. Take five, guys.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.762
DID I LOOK SPONTANEOUS?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.931
AS MANY TIMES AS WE REHEARSED
IT, IT WAS STILL A SHOCKER.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.801
OH. I TOOK THAT
MESSAGE OF COMPETENCE

05:00.834 --> 05:03.671
AND CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY
AND I MADE IT MY BITCH!

05:04.805 --> 05:07.375
OOOH, CELESTE, HEY, SO DID
YOU GET SOME GOOD STUFF?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.610
THIS ALL FELT A LITTLE STAGED.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.645
- REALLY?
- ( forced laughter )

05:11.679 --> 05:13.614
I MEAN, HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

05:13.647 --> 05:16.717
OOH, CELESTE, THEY'VE MOVED MEL'S
ZONING HEARING UP TO 2:00.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.420
AND GUESS WHO'S PRESIDING. HOLA.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.856
IT SOUNDS GRIPPING. I'LL LET C.N.N.
GET THAT ONE.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.398
CELESTE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
EVER BEEN TO A ZONING HEARING,

05:30.431 --> 05:33.734
BUT WHEN I RUN THEM,
NO ONE ZONES OUT!

05:33.767 --> 05:36.704
NAH, I'M JUST NOT
FEELING THE STORY YET.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.740
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO
DRAW THE VIEWER IN.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.675
WHO ARE THESE KIDS?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.711
OH, THAT'S MY NIECE AND NEPHEW.
THEY LIVE WITH ME.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.646
TWO TYPICAL TEENAGERS...
MOM'S IN JAIL,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.881
DAD'S ON THE LAM,
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.618
OF COURSE! THE
INNOCENT BYSTANDERS

05:50.651 --> 05:53.387
IN LEWIS SCANLON'S
GREAT PONZI SCHEME.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.323
( sniffs ) I SMELL STORY BACON.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.893
WHY DON'T I BRING THE CREW OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON?

05:59.927 --> 06:02.863
OH NO NO NO, THE STORY
LIVES RIGHT HERE.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.766
HERE... YOU KNOW, TIGHTLY
CONFINED WITHIN THESE WALLS.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.903
BUT HEY, SURE, LET'S
GO TO THE HOUSE.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.949
YEAH, DO IT. YEAH.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.686
THAT FIRE THING ISN'T A PART OF
AUNT MEL'S APPROVED KITCHEN DECOR.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.721
SHE'S NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.691
I THINK YOUR AUNT VALUES HER LIFE MORE
THAN SHE VALUES HER KITCHEN DECOR.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.861
YOU'VE LEARNED NOTHING IN THE
TIME YOU'VE BEEN HERE, HAVE YOU?

06:35.028 --> 06:36.764
OH GOOD, EVERYBODY'S HERE.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.932
OKAY, NOW DON'T FREAK OUT,

06:38.966 --> 06:42.703
BUT COMING TO OUR HOUSE THIS
AFTERNOON: CELESTE VEGA.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.640
I KNOW, RIGHT?

06:46.674 --> 06:48.909
CELESTE VEGA... CHANNEL 8?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.711
"TOLEDO TODAY."

06:50.744 --> 06:52.746
IS SHE THE ONE WHO WAS
STANDING IN THE HURRICANE

06:52.780 --> 06:55.516
WHEN THAT STOP SIGN
HIT HER IN THE FACE?

06:55.549 --> 06:58.118
YEAH AND HER HAIR STAYED
PERFECT THE WHOLE TIME.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.821
SO THE REPORTER IS COMING
OVER TO THE HOUSE?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.790
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING
TO STAY AT YOUR OFFICE.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.125
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
"CONTROLLING THE MESSAGE."

07:05.158 --> 07:08.128
YOU KNOW? NUM NUM NUM.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.964
I'M CONTROLLING IT HERE.

07:10.998 --> 07:15.068
PLEASE, YOU GUYS, DON'T DO OR
SAY ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS ME.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.138
OH, YOU MEAN THE WAY YOU EMBARRASSED
YOUR DAD WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE?

07:18.171 --> 07:21.842
IT'S REAL SIMPLE, OKAY? WHENEVER YOU'RE
GETTING OUT OF ANY KIND OF VEHICLE,

07:21.875 --> 07:25.145
WEAR UNDERWEAR.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.948
LOOK, THE POINT IS
STAY ON MESSAGE.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.917
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
THIS IS YOUR DEAL.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.685
- I DON'T EVEN EXIST.
- THANK YOU.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.687
- I JUST DON'T WANT ANY SURPRISES.
- FINE.

07:33.721 --> 07:37.190
UH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SCUBA
TANK DOING IN MY KITCHEN?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.827
IT'S A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.462
OKAY WELL, IT'S NOT A PART
OF MY APPROVED DECOR.

07:42.496 --> 07:47.768
- CAN YOU MAKE IT DISAPPEAR?
- JOE LONGO, MEET MEL BURKE.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.009
SO, LENNOX, YOUR AUNT
HAS A COLORFUL PAST.

07:56.043 --> 08:00.080
YOU MUST'VE HEARD THE STORIES
OR SEEN THE RACY PICTURES?

08:00.113 --> 08:03.183
Come on. All those
pictures were faked.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.153
I mean, there's no way she
ever looked that good.

08:06.186 --> 08:10.190
But the important thing now is that
she is a hard-working public official

08:10.223 --> 08:12.159
and I wear clothes
all the time...

08:12.192 --> 08:14.562
especially when
exiting a vehicle.

08:17.565 --> 08:21.068
SO, RYDER, ARE YOU REBELLIOUS
LIKE YOUR AUNT WAS AT YOUR AGE?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.736
S-s-sure,

08:22.770 --> 08:26.607
sure, but in a very controlled
and responsible way.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.476
Aunt Mel feels that rebellion
can best be handled

08:29.509 --> 08:31.612
in a safe and loving
home environment.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.683
Although she's not
here very often.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.084
Because she works all the time.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.787
Work work work. She
loves America.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.059
MEL BURKE, HOW DO YOU DO IT ALL?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.829
I just do.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.599
When I'm faced with a
challenge, I rise to it.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.601
It's like I tell
everyone in my office:

08:53.634 --> 08:57.771
there are no problems,
only opportunities.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.272
Cookie?

08:59.306 --> 09:03.110
HOW DOES SOMEONE AS BUSY AS YOU
HAVE TIME TO BAKE COOKIES?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.778
( kids laugh )

09:04.812 --> 09:07.681
She doesn't even know
where the kitchen is.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.782
Yeah, Joe made these.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.550
WHO'S JOE?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.552
ARE YOU HIDING A MAN FROM US?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.856
He's our... nanny.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.692
A MALE NANNY? WELL,
LET'S MEET HIM.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.261
Oh, he doesn't like to, you
know, talk to the media.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.632
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN
HIM HIS TALKING POINTS?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.667
What? Talking points?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.669
I don't even know what that is.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.970
CUT, BOYS.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.205
- MEL, CAN WE HAVE A MINUTE?
- ALL RIGHT.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.810
LOOK, THIS WHOLE COOKIE-BAKING
THING IS ADORABLE.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.646
BUT NO ONE'S BUYING IT.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.815
IF I DON'T GET SOMETHING FRESH
AND UNREHEARSED RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

09:41.849 --> 09:44.785
WE'RE GONNA RERUN THE
OLD DUCK MASSACRE.

09:44.818 --> 09:48.188
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- WAIT, SO YOU THINK THIS WHOLE THING

09:48.221 --> 09:50.123
HAS BEEN ONE BIG SET...
I'LL GO GET HIM.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.327
C'MON, JOE, SHE'S
LOOKING FOR STORY PORK

09:54.361 --> 09:57.865
OR STORY BEEF OR SOME
KIND OF STORY MEAT.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.834
THE POINT IS WITHOUT
YOU I'M A DEAD DUCK.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.071
I FEEL FOR YOU, I REALLY DO.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.806
JUST NOT ENOUGH TO HELP YOU OUT.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.941
- IT'LL JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
- YEAH,

10:07.975 --> 10:11.945
THAT'S WHAT THE REPORTER TOLD ME RIGHT
BEFORE I BECAME DOUCHY PORSCHE GUY.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.015
AND HERE THEY ARE, THE COUNCILWOMAN
AND HER CUTE GUY NANNY.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.786
- ( scoffs ) Okay.
- Joe, please please?

10:18.819 --> 10:21.955
JUST TWO QUESTIONS, THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.758
- I'LL COOK DINNER FOR YOU.
- DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.727
I WILL NEVER COOK YOU DINNER.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.065
ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT TWO QUESTIONS.
SHOOT.

10:32.099 --> 10:36.704
SO, JOE LONGO, WHAT IS IT LIKE
TO HAVE MEL BURKE AS A BOSS?

10:36.737 --> 10:40.140
Okay, first of all,
I'm freelance.

10:40.173 --> 10:44.044
OF COURSE. BUT YOU USED TO
WORK FOR SCANLON TRUST.

10:44.077 --> 10:47.280
HEY, I RAN MY DIVISION
ETHICALLY AND RESPONSIBLY.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.617
SCANLON TOOK DOWN SO MANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE, DIDN'T HE?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.720
DON'T TRY TO TWIST
MY WORDS AROUND...

10:52.753 --> 10:55.255
YES. YES, THAT'S TRUE.

10:55.288 --> 10:59.626
BUT WHERE OTHERS WOULD BE
BITTER, YOU'VE MOVED ON.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.061
NOW YOU'RE A NANNY.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.164
CLEARLY, IT TAKES A MAN
WHO IS TOTALLY SECURE

11:04.197 --> 11:06.800
IN HIS MASCULINITY TO
TAKE ON A JOB LIKE THIS.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.103
ACTUALLY, IT DOES.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.841
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.776
IT'S ALL ABOUT
ORGANIZATION, REALLY.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.845
YOU JUST MAKE A PLAN AND
YOU STICK TO THE PLAN

11:17.878 --> 11:19.980
AND THEN YOU TRY TO CELEBRATE
THE LITTLE THINGS.

11:20.013 --> 11:24.117
Ladies, drop everything
and get one of these!

11:24.151 --> 11:26.053
Well, actually there
is only one of these

11:26.086 --> 11:28.121
so it's kinda of a first
come, first serve.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.257
Okay. That was wonderful.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.325
THANK YOU, JOE. LET'S LEAVE
THIS POOR MAN ALONE.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.729
NO, THIS POOR MAN'S FINE.
WHY DON'T YOU STICK AROUND?

11:35.763 --> 11:36.964
I DON'T MIND IF I DO.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.767
So, Joe, tell me what
you're making here.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.770
Well, it's just chili. But it's
my grandmother's secret recipe.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.437
- Then I won't tell a soul.
- Okay,

11:44.471 --> 11:48.341
OKAY, WE GOT DICED SHALLOTS,
CHILI PEPPER AND OF COURSE...

11:48.375 --> 11:50.978
- the secret ingredient.
- Dark chocolate?

11:51.011 --> 11:53.313
Yeah, you wouldn't believe
how rich it makes the sauce.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.348
HE ACTUALLY MADE
THIS VERY SAME CHILI

11:55.382 --> 11:58.218
THE NIGHT THAT MY LANDMARK
PRESCHOOL REFORM BILL PASSED.

11:58.251 --> 12:02.189
We had over 300 parents and
children gathered at City Hall.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.457
- I was fighting back tears and I said...
- FIRE!

12:04.491 --> 12:07.094
EVERYBODY BACK! EVERYBODY BACK!

12:07.127 --> 12:08.862
KEEP ROLLING!

12:12.866 --> 12:14.768
Sorry about that.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.404
Did you see that? I
mean, he's amazing!

12:17.437 --> 12:20.007
Is there anything you can't do?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.810
No comment.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.812
So I told those
preschool families...

12:24.845 --> 12:26.780
oh, screw it.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.885
DOUGIE, HERE YOU GO, MAN.
FRISCO, THERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.054
LISTEN GUYS, REHEAT
THAT AT 300°.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.489
280 AND IT'S RUINED!
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.759
I GOTTA SAY, I WAS WRONG.
I THINK THAT WENT GREAT.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.862
CELESTE SAYS IT'S GOING
TO BE A TERRIFIC PIECE.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.797
- I THINK I REALLY HELPED YOU OUT THERE.
- HELPED ME WHAT?

12:43.831 --> 12:46.466
DISAPPEAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
LIKE THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHER?

12:46.499 --> 12:49.803
I'M SENSING A LITTLE VIBE HERE
AND IT'S NOT APPRECIATION.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.872
I HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK SERIOUS,

12:51.905 --> 12:54.074
TO BE TOLEDO'S HARD-WORKING
CITY COUNCILWOMAN.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.943
AND INSTEAD I ENDED
UP THE SIDEKICK

12:55.976 --> 12:58.745
IN "JOE LONGO'S CHOCOLATE
CHILI THROW-DOWN."

12:58.778 --> 13:00.814
IT WAS YOU'RE IDEA FOR
ME TO BE STORY MEAT.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.416
YEAH WELL, I GUESS I
SHOULD HAVE GONE VEGAN.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.053
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TWO QUESTIONS
AND THEN YOU GOT ALL ADORABLE!

13:06.086 --> 13:08.856
- I BET THEY OFFER YOU YOUR OWN MORNING SHOW!
- WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.757
SHE SHOT THE WHOLE DAY WITH
YOU AT YOUR OFFICE, RIGHT?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.793
OH YES, ALL THAT FASCINATING
HALLS-OF-GOVERNMENT STUFF.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.795
SNIP SNIP SNIP SNIP SNIP
SNIP SNIP SNIP SNIP!

13:15.829 --> 13:17.764
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO RUN
ANY OF THAT DEMOCRACY CRAP!

13:17.797 --> 13:21.534
- I'M SORRY THAT YOU CAME OFF BORING.
- I WAS NOT BORING.

13:21.568 --> 13:26.373
I WAS SINCERE. I WAS LIKE C-SPAN AND
YOU WERE LIKE CIRQUE DU SO-LONGO!

13:26.406 --> 13:29.076
OH, CHOCOLATE, FIRE,
ACTS OF DERRING-DO!

13:29.109 --> 13:31.078
- THEY LOVED IT!
- I KNOW!

13:31.111 --> 13:33.046
- SO YOU'RE PISSED BECAUSE IT WENT WELL.
- YES!

13:33.080 --> 13:36.083
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SCREW THINGS UP FOR YOU!
- APOLOGY ACCEPTED!

13:37.851 --> 13:40.353
AND YOU GAVE AWAY ALL THE CHILI...
KISS-ASS.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.432
JOE, CAN WE INSTALL
THIS ALARM NOW?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.401
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU
SHOULD ASK YOUR AUNT.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.204
IF SHE WANTS US TO DO IT THEN WE
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T, 'CAUSE APPARENTLY

13:57.237 --> 14:00.273
WHEN SHE ASKS YOU TO DO SOMETHING AND
YOU DO IT, THEN SHE GETS MAD AT YOU.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.842
I'LL TELL YOU THE KIND OF ALARM
I'D LIKE TO INSTALL, RYDER.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.913
THE KIND THAT GOES OFF WHEN
SOMEONE STEALS THE SPOTLIGHT.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.918
THAT WASN'T ABOUT
THE ALARM, WAS IT?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.619
SMART BOY.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.224
- ♪ Can't touch this... ♪
- LENNOX, I NEED TO WORK

14:17.257 --> 14:20.860
- AND THAT THING'S DISTRACTING.
- COME ON, AUNT MEL! IT'S THE ONLY PLACE I CAN DO THIS!

14:20.894 --> 14:23.830
I'M SORRY, BUT WORK TAKES PRECEDENCE
OVER KIDS' DANCEY GAMES THAT LIKE TO...

14:23.863 --> 14:26.199
LOOK, I JUST GOT 1,000 POINTS.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.202
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING! OH
LOOK, YOU JUST GOT A COMBO!

14:29.236 --> 14:32.305
- SEE? DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?
- YEAH, I DO.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.842
WOW, I SHOULD GET ONE
OF THESE FOR MY OFFICE.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.279
OH AND LOOK! VIRTUAL
ME IS GLOWING!

14:39.312 --> 14:41.114
AND IS 5'8".

15:00.033 --> 15:02.902
HEY, YOU WANT TO COME IN?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.404
NOT REALLY.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.040
OKAY. YOU WANT ME TO
HAVE MEL COME OUT?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.541
OH NO.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.045
I'M GONNA GO TO THE
TRASH CAN NOW.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.646
CAN I JOIN YOU?

15:14.647 --> 15:16.616
SURE. YEAH.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.619
( exhales )

15:19.652 --> 15:23.023
I FEEL BETTER. EXERCISE
RELEASES ENDORPHINS.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.558
IS SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.528
I SAW MY FRIEND JULIE
FROM "TOLEDO TODAY"

15:28.561 --> 15:30.330
AND SHE SHOWED ME
THE PIECE ON MEL.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.999
CELESTE MADE MEL LOOK BAD...

15:32.032 --> 15:34.367
LIKE A DRIVEN,
CAREER-OBSESSED WORKBOT

15:34.401 --> 15:37.237
WHO LETS HER NANNY TAKE
CARE OF EVERYTHING.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.938
YOU CAME ACROSS GREAT.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.540
I'M VERY PHOTOGENIC.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.942
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS EIGHT,
MY MOM PUT ME IN COMMERCIALS.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.944
I'D KILL TO HAVE YOUR EYELASHES.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.180
- NAW.
- WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

15:47.214 --> 15:50.383
IT'S A DISASTER. SOMEBODY SHOULD LET MEL
KNOW, BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE ME.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.685
- PLEASE NOT ME, NOT ME!
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.088
TAKE A DEEP BREATH... TAKE A FEW.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.924
OKAY? ALL RIGHT.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.092
WAIT A MINUTE!

15:59.126 --> 16:01.161
WERE YOU THE "HEY, THAT'S
MY PEANUT BUTTER!" KID?

16:03.130 --> 16:06.266
NO, THAT WAS RICKY SCHROEDER.
IT WAS POLITICAL.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.676
( knocks )

16:16.709 --> 16:19.079
HEY, ANYBODY IN
HERE INTERESTED IN

16:19.112 --> 16:21.314
MY SHOULD-BE-FAMOUS
BOLOGNESE SAUCE?

16:21.348 --> 16:23.416
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
NANNY McFABULOUS.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.018
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

16:26.553 --> 16:29.089
- IT'S A BRIBE.
- BRIBING ME WITH SAUCE.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.358
KEEP TALKING.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.127
YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THE
WRONG IMPRESSION ABOUT MEL

16:34.161 --> 16:36.196
WHEN YOU WERE OVER AT THE
HOUSE THE OTHER DAY.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.998
THAT SHE'S A WORK-OBSESSED

16:39.032 --> 16:41.501
CONTROL FREAK WHO'S HANDED
HER KIDS OFF TO THE NANNY

16:41.534 --> 16:43.636
AND LIES ABOUT BAKING?

16:43.670 --> 16:46.673
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT THE
RIGHT IMPRESSION,

16:46.706 --> 16:48.675
BUT IT'S, UM... IT'S NOT TRUE.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.212
JOE, IT'S NICE OF YOU
TO GO TO BAT FOR HER,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.581
BUT I SAW WHAT I SAW.
THE CAMERA DOESN'T LIE.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.716
YEAH, NEITHER DOES
THE CELL PHONE.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.352
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING THAT I SHOT.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.021
THIS IS HER AT RYDER'S
BASEBALL GAME.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.324
- ( cheering )
- Go Ryder, go!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.393
Yeah! Eat dirt, Red Sox!

17:08.061 --> 17:10.197
AND THAT WAS WHEN RYDER
HIT A FOUL BALL.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.633
AND HERE SHE IS AT
LENNOX'S POETRY RECITAL.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.735
Go Lennox, go! Woo-hoo, yeah!

17:15.768 --> 17:18.805
Eat dirt, Maya Angelou!

17:20.073 --> 17:22.275
THAT'S THE SIDE OF HER
YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.278
SHE'S PASSIONATE AND-AND CARING.

17:25.312 --> 17:28.115
AND SHE'S A GREAT AUNT AND MAKES A
REALLY REALLY GOOD COUNCILPERSON.

17:28.148 --> 17:31.684
OH MY GOD. YOU TWO HAVE A THING.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.222
WHAT?! NO! NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.125
NOT UNLESS BY "THING" YOU MEAN
SHE'S TERRIBLY IRRITATING.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.628
NO, IT'S JUST THAT I ADMIRE HER.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.396
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON

17:43.430 --> 17:46.099
AND I JUST WISH YOUR
STORY WOULD SHOW THAT.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.301
ARE YOU DONE?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.071
YES, I'M DONE.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.540
NO, UM...

17:53.573 --> 17:56.309
WHEN YOU REHEAT THAT SAUCE, YOU
HAVE TO DO IT ON THE STOVE TOP.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.545
'CAUSE IF YOU DO IT IN THE
MICROWAVE IT WILL EXPLODE

17:58.578 --> 17:59.779
AND CLEAN-UP IS A BITCH.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.216
ENJOY.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.819
Y'KNOW, I THINK THERE'S
ENOUGH HERE FOR TWO.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.757
ANY PARTICULAR TWO?

18:12.125 --> 18:15.528
That was dynamic Mel
Burke: aunt, friend,

18:15.562 --> 18:18.798
councilperson and the focus
of today's "Toledo Today."

18:18.831 --> 18:21.668
WOW, THAT TURNED
OUT PRETTY GREAT!

18:21.701 --> 18:24.704
THANK GOD, BECAUSE IT
WAS SO HORRIBLE BEFORE.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.639
BEFORE WHAT?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.741
BEFORE IT GOT BETTER?

18:28.775 --> 18:30.610
STEPHANIE, COME.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.712
SIT. SPEAK.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.849
OKAY, I FOUND OUT FROM MY
FRIEND JULIE AT CHANNEL 8

18:36.883 --> 18:39.586
THAT CELESTE'S FIRST CLIP
MADE YOU LOOK LIKE A ROBOTIC,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.454
CAREER-OBSESSED SUPERBITCH.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.157
THOSE WORDS ARE LIKE
ASHES IN MY MOUTH.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.093
SO I WENT AND TOLD JOE AND HE
WENT AND TALKED TO CELESTE...

18:47.126 --> 18:48.795
- JOE?
- YEAH.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.164
DID YOU KNOW HE USE TO
DO COMMERCIALS AS A KID?

18:51.198 --> 18:53.300
AND HOW POLITICAL THAT WORLD IS?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.303
ANYWAY, AFTER HE TALKED TO
HER, SHE CHANGED EVERYTHING.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.238
SO HAPPY ENDING, RIGHT?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.606
YOU WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.874
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
REALLY MAD AT ME.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.411
- WHO ASKED JOE TO INTERVENE?
- NOT ME!

19:04.444 --> 19:06.246
HE THINKS HE HAS TO RESCUE ME?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.415
HE THINKS I CAN'T
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF?

19:08.448 --> 19:11.284
I MEAN, SURE, I START THE OCCASIONAL
KITCHEN FIRE AND HE HAS TO PUT IT OUT.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.520
AND I INVITE A CONNIVING
REPORTER INTO OUR HOUSE,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.121
EVEN THOUGH HE WARNED ME NOT TO.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.257
AND I DEPEND ON HIM
IN A LOT OF WAYS,

19:17.290 --> 19:20.693
BUT HE SHOULD LET ME TAKE CARE OF...
MYSELF.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.365
HE'S REALLY A VERY
APPEALING GUY...

19:25.398 --> 19:27.834
IF YOU LIKE THAT.
PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.675
"LOOK, JOE, I BROUGHT
YOU SOME DINNER,

19:35.708 --> 19:38.645
BUT I DIDN'T COOK IT,
SO YOU'RE SAFE."

19:38.678 --> 19:41.548
"HEY, I HOPE YOU LIKE DIM
SUM 'CAUSE I GOT SOME."

19:41.581 --> 19:43.683
DON'T SAY THAT.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.818
NUT UP, BURKE, AND JUST GO IN.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.178
STEPHANIE, HEY, IT'S ME.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.813
I JUST REMEMBERED SOME THINGS

20:13.846 --> 20:15.548
I NEED TO GO OVER WITH
YOU AT THE OFFICE.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.417
CAN YOU MEET ME RIGHT NOW?

20:17.450 --> 20:22.989
GREAT. AND I'LL BRING DINNER.

NO NO NO, I'LL WRITE A NOTE.
