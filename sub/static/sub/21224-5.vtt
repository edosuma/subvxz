the Rams opted

02:24.578 --> 02:27.681
for the patient approach,
starting veteran Case Keenum.

to be the better option?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.953

Jared's improving,

I keep saying that as you guys
keep asking the questions.

what happened Week 1.

that each week is important,

then let him pick his hole.

Hey, you get one-on-one!

10:29.129 --> 10:30.731
Everybody else has got
to have help,

10:30.764 --> 10:31.999
but you don't!

10:32.032 --> 10:34.768
They said hut,
I'm like this.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.906
I just pulled...74
right into the quarterback.

10:38.939 --> 10:43.143
Narrator: Only problem is the
Panthers' defense is good, too.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.212
They neutralize Todd Gurley...

10:45.245 --> 10:46.747
Announcer #1:
The run game as a whole,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.982
and Gurley especially,
has been baffled.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.384
Announcer #2:
Three yards per carry,
and that's not good enough.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.788
Narrator: ...putting even more
pressure on Case Keenum.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.123
Announcer #1: Keenum unloads.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.426
He's got Quick wide open,
and he missed him!

10:59.459 --> 11:01.128
Oh, my goodness.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.932
Missed him!
...

11:04.965 --> 11:08.268
Announcer #1: He was two steps
behind the defense,

11:08.301 --> 11:10.370
and Keenum led him too far.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.339
Case: I'll get the ball out.
Don't tell me.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.974
Y'all keep doing what
you're doing, man, okay?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.776
Y'all keep doing
what you're doing.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.810
Keep winning out there.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.978
All right, keep winning.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.480
I'm going to give y'all
a chance.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.751
Announcer #1: Play action this
time from the under-center snap.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.219
Throws, and it's intercepted!

11:28.455 --> 11:29.723
Wow.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.491
There is
the 11th interception

11:31.524 --> 11:33.727
of the season
for Case Keenum,

11:33.761 --> 11:37.330
who walks to his sideline
with a chorus of boos.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.066
[ Crowd boos ]

11:39.099 --> 11:41.835
Every time the Rams offense
comes off the field,

11:41.869 --> 11:43.270
the crowd here at the Coliseum

11:43.303 --> 11:45.438
becomes more and more vocal

11:45.472 --> 11:47.908
in their displeasure
with Keenum and the offense.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.778
[ Crowd chanting
"We want Goff!" ]

11:50.811 --> 11:52.913
Fans chanting, "We want Goff!"

12:03.924 --> 12:06.159
Case, coming out
of the bye week,

12:06.193 --> 12:09.863
has not looked the part of
a first-string NFL quarterback.

12:14.167 --> 12:20.307
We need to talk about
the quarterbacks position.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.242
Let's turn it on!

12:22.275 --> 12:24.111
I want to see everybody
follow the...ball!

12:24.144 --> 12:25.813
Wide receivers,
that's great!

12:25.846 --> 12:28.081
Hey, man, let's go!

12:28.115 --> 12:29.482
Let's go kick ass, man!

12:29.516 --> 12:31.084
Let's go kick they ass!

12:31.118 --> 12:33.887
Let's go!

12:33.921 --> 12:36.256
Narrator: Midway through
the fourth quarter,

12:36.289 --> 12:39.492
a desperate Rams offense
comes to life.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.362
Announcer #1:
The Rams are driving.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.164
Third down and goal from the 7.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.867
No field goals here.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.536
-Keenum, time.
-Fired, dropped!

12:49.569 --> 12:51.238
[ All groan ]

12:52.205 --> 12:53.540
Announcer #1: Case Keenum.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.242
They can call for Goff
all they want,

12:55.275 --> 12:57.845
but that's right
between the numbers.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.313
You literally cannot
throw it any better.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.084
Lance Kendricks had
a touchdown in his hands

13:04.117 --> 13:07.054
and dropped it.

13:07.087 --> 13:10.323
Announcer #3:
Jeff Fisher says, "We have to
help our quarterback."

13:10.357 --> 13:12.826
You have to make those catches
to help out this offense.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.562
Narrator:
The Rams settle for 3.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.931
A late touchdown
brings them close,

13:17.965 --> 13:21.201
but can't prevent
a fourth straight loss.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.013
Announcer #3: We just need to
see more explosiveness

13:33.046 --> 13:34.481
from this Rams offense.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.416
Something has to happen.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.185
You just can't score
10 points at home.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.187
That's just not
going to work.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.057
Man: So, there was
a "We want Goff" chant.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.458
Is that part
of the frustration

13:45.492 --> 13:47.895
you might expect
from a crowd?

13:47.928 --> 13:51.064
You know, it's frustrating.
I'm frustrated.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.632
You know, I'm glad they care.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.069
I do.
I'm really glad the fans care.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.138
You know, I care, too.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.140
I put a lot into this.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.641
When we're not scoring points,

14:01.674 --> 14:03.376
when we're not moving the
football, it's frustrating.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.445
I can tell they're frustrated.
We're frustrated, too.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.515
But we're doing our best,
and we're going to go back

14:08.548 --> 14:11.484
and look at it and, you know,
see what we need to fix

14:11.518 --> 14:14.087
and come in Monday ready to go.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.198
Strictly football-wise,
definitely some regrets

14:25.232 --> 14:31.604
and some just missed
opportunities that,

14:31.638 --> 14:33.206
you know,
kind of weigh heavily,

14:33.240 --> 14:36.243
especially, you know,
being the quarterback

14:36.276 --> 14:38.645
and that's why
I play the position,

14:38.678 --> 14:42.082
you know, to have
that responsibility,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.316
have the ball in my hands,

14:43.350 --> 14:45.919
and, you know,
we're not winning.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.989
I take it heavily
on myself, so...

14:49.022 --> 14:50.423
It's been hard on everybody,

14:50.457 --> 14:53.693
I mean, we have a really
tight group, so it's hard.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.262
Case:
We have to stick together.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.629
You know, we're all fighting
for the name

14:56.663 --> 14:58.365
on the front of our jersey,
but, you know,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.100
we care more than anybody.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.236
I put everything I possibly
could into this season,

15:03.270 --> 15:05.605
and I'll have no regrets
about giving everything

15:05.638 --> 15:09.642
I possibly could every day.

15:09.676 --> 15:15.148
Not winning is obviously
not fun for anybody.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.184
You know, you could look at it
that way and think that,

15:17.217 --> 15:18.418
you know,
"Oh, woe is me."

15:18.451 --> 15:20.087
But, you know,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.122
I tell guys all the time
that we've got a great job.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.092
I've got a great job,
and I get to come home,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.326
and she still loves me.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.561
She's still here,
so she hasn't left,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.130
and she always has my back,

15:30.163 --> 15:33.533
and, you know,

15:33.566 --> 15:37.404
it's just kind of a crappy
couple weeks, for sure.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.709
Danielle:
See, we practice at home.
We're a practicing family.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.544
Ooh, and it's going to be tricky
because it's not full,

15:44.577 --> 15:46.146
so, all right?
Ready?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.647
No pressure.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.051
Good job, babe!

15:51.084 --> 15:54.221
I would say 75% of the time,
she's cooking.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.588
He makes
really good omelets.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.757
Like, he can flip them
in the pan, like...

15:57.790 --> 16:01.461
I haven't attempted.
I almost did the other day,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.396
and I was like,
"This is going to be so bad.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.598
I'll be so mad
if I drop this omelet."

16:05.632 --> 16:10.070
Narrator:
Drop an omelet in your kitchen,
and there's egg on the floor.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.072
Drop a touchdown
in the Coliseum,

16:12.105 --> 16:16.109
and you've got egg on your face
in front of 90,000 people.

16:16.143 --> 16:20.313
Yesterday was a little rough,
I have to say.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.449
It's not really
quite what we expected,

16:22.482 --> 16:24.051
so, you know,
we talk about it.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.618
We come home.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.021
We eat.
Eat a lot.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.689
Eat our feelings.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.060
You know, we're all not
satisfied with how we played.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.694
You know, there's always
a couple plays

16:34.727 --> 16:36.629
that you want
to take back.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.531
For me, that was tough

16:38.565 --> 16:42.802
because I tried
to really critique myself

16:42.835 --> 16:46.573
and be very...

16:46.606 --> 16:48.575
Well, the important thing
is, though, is that he sees it,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.377
and look at things,
he doesn't like,

16:50.410 --> 16:53.713
beat himself up about it
and then he doesn't let that

16:53.746 --> 16:55.515
come into
our relationship.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.716
It's just something
that you reflect on,

16:56.749 --> 16:58.218
and you keep on moving.
Yeah.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.586
And he's
a really good player,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.354
so it's not like
that happens all the time.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.291
I like to think so.
Yeah, it doesn't happen often.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.558
We can't lose hope.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.127
This is a really
important time for us

17:07.160 --> 17:08.828
to make something
out of this year.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.597
We have to figure out
what it is

17:10.630 --> 17:12.265
in the fourth quarter
that we're not doing.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.834
We got to figure that out,
and we got to play our best,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.337
and we haven't been
doing that thus far.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.240

17:20.273 --> 17:23.776
Boras: We have no margin
for error right now.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.747
That's what.
We have zero margin for error.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.116
I don't want look ahead,
but, you know what?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.583
You go beat
the...Jets.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.285
Come back here,
we beat the Dolphins.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.653
We're sitting here
at 5-5,

17:33.686 --> 17:35.388
and you know what's
going to happen?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.723
All those little ticker boxes
that show up on ESPN,

17:36.756 --> 17:39.192
you know what
it's going to say?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.594
"Wild card -- Rams.
In the hunt -- Rams.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.131
Control their own
destiny -- Rams."

17:44.164 --> 17:46.399
That's all, huh?
Go get this first one.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.601
It's all tail. You get this one,
get the next one, and...

17:48.635 --> 17:50.437
You know?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.472
[ Sighs deeply ]

17:52.505 --> 17:55.775
Now we don't get this one,
it may go dark place. [ Laughs ]

17:55.808 --> 17:57.244
We're gonna
get this one.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.578
We're gonna get
this...

17:58.611 --> 18:00.213
We'll find a way.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.882
This team's
going to respond.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.451
Good.
There's the crotch.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.887
Got a G!
Got a G! G!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.856
Narrator: In an attempt
to shake things up,

18:09.889 --> 18:12.425
Jeff Fisher redesigns practice.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.894
All right,
13, G, 79.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.330
He personally takes control
of the scout team

18:17.364 --> 18:18.598
to ratchet up the intensity.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.667
"T" got the motion.
Rice, you're on.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.435
"T"'s got the motion.
Here we go.

18:22.469 --> 18:26.406
Quarterbacks coach Chris Weinke
sends in the plays,

18:26.439 --> 18:31.444
allowing offensive coordinator
Rob Boras more time to instruct.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.845
If it's not right,
we're doing it again.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.215
Hold each other accountable
right now.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.584
Don't be the one
that has the breakdown.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.918
11 is 1 right now.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.188
Starts now, not Sunday.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.456
Narrator:
Receivers like Lance Kendricks

18:43.490 --> 18:47.427
take extra reps
at the Jugs machine...

18:47.460 --> 18:51.664
and with quarterbacks
after practice.

18:51.698 --> 18:55.935
But no one knows when the most
important change will be made.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.306
All right, man, here we go.
Eyes on the quarterback.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.274
20! Set, hut!

19:01.308 --> 19:04.544
Narrator: Jared Goff wants to
start, and he's getting close.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.678
Set!

19:08.248 --> 19:09.516
You're up next.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.418
The coaching staff
is spending the time

19:11.451 --> 19:13.453
to make sure
he's ready when

19:13.486 --> 19:15.222
and if he gets the call.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.824
"Open" is the "O" term
for the tight end

19:17.857 --> 19:19.859
to tell him to take
his gun away and, yeah.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.294
But you're under.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.695
So, "open" just attaches
him two-point.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.831
You know, you're fine.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.199
I just want to know
what you're thinking.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.634
Okay, okay.
That's all.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.602
I want you to be able
to articulate it to me.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.937
You know what I'm saying?
That's all I'm asking.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.405
The more
you can talk about it,

19:32.439 --> 19:33.940
the more you can
tell me what you saw,

19:33.973 --> 19:35.708
the better I understand it,
you know?

19:37.344 --> 19:40.313
Go ahead.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.848
Man:
Here's the Jeff Fisher show,

19:41.881 --> 19:45.385
previewing the trip to New York
to take on the Jets.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.886
Farr: You know, it's the
grown-man league,

19:46.919 --> 19:48.555
and I don't know
how much you can hear.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.658
You got your headset on,
but the crowd booed.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.627
I mean, they had a field day
booing right there. I mean --

19:54.661 --> 19:56.529
Fisher: Well, yeah, I heard
about that. They were booing,

19:56.563 --> 19:59.332
and they were cheering
for Jared and Jared and Jared.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.869
I know
there's a huge push

20:02.902 --> 20:04.871
and sentiment for Jared,

20:04.904 --> 20:10.410
but this Jet defense
is special,

20:10.443 --> 20:13.980
and it's complex,

20:14.013 --> 20:17.016
and Case gives us
the best chance

20:17.049 --> 20:18.551
to go in there
and win this game.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.287
We need to win this game.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.889
I know it's a difficult topic
and difficult discussion,

20:22.922 --> 20:26.293
especially when, you know,
we've lost consecutively,

20:26.326 --> 20:28.495
but it's a hard
position to play,

20:28.528 --> 20:30.897
and it takes time.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.633
And so I'm not
balking off of that thing.

20:33.666 --> 20:37.437
Nobody's telling me
to play him or not play him.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.872
We're making, you know, he's
going to be our quarterback,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.708
and he's going to be really,
really good,

20:41.741 --> 20:45.345
but our best chance to win at
New York right now is with Case.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.981
Announcer #1:
This is a desperation game

20:49.015 --> 20:50.917
for New York
and for Los Angeles.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.553
The winner might feel like they
have a chance in the back half.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.823
The loser is going
to have to re-evaluate.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.959
Rams begin the day dead
last in scoring offense.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.461
No change at quarterback.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.663
It will be Case Keenum
again today.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.665
Jeff Fisher and his
coaching staff

21:05.698 --> 21:08.301
resist the groundswell
of support for Jared Goff

21:08.335 --> 21:10.002
that we heard last week
in the Coliseum.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.804
Announcer #2: Especially against
this kind of defensive front

21:11.838 --> 21:14.374
you're going to face today,
you don't put him in harm's way.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.576
You make sure that you
protect your investment

21:16.609 --> 21:18.978
until he's ready to go out there
and make plays.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.550
I tried to call you.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.518
May have left a message.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.554
Just want you to know
either way, today,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.956
I'm going to go with the rook
next week at home.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.858
Oh, are you?
Yeah, okay.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.826
I haven't said anything.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.496
It's kind of leaking out
a little bit.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.998
Every one of these games,
we're there to win them.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.667
Oh, I know.
We're right there.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.969
Yeah, and he's there, too.
He's there, too.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.639
We're right there, so,
you know...

21:46.673 --> 21:48.508
keep our head down.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.842
Defense is playing amazing.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.378
Special teams
are doing good.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.446
We play good today,
you know?

21:53.480 --> 21:54.814
We get that offense.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.616
If we could just
run the ball,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.885
that seems to be the biggest
single issue, isn't it?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.787
That's the issue.
They're making us throw.
Yeah.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.655
They're packing it up,

22:02.689 --> 22:04.457
and saying,
"Pick it up and throw it."

22:04.491 --> 22:06.426
Yeah.

22:06.459 --> 22:09.061
Narrator:
He doesn't know it,

22:09.095 --> 22:10.997
but this is Case Keenum's
last game

22:11.030 --> 22:12.632
as the Rams'
starting quarterback.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.701
Let's go.
Shotgun...right.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.804
Announcer #1:
Case Keenum and the Rams offense
will get the ball first.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.005
We're moving the ball.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.607
No, do you know
what that means?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.675
We're moving the ball.
We're moving the ball.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.910
Watch this sack.
Oh! [ Gasps ]

22:23.943 --> 22:25.111
Watch this pick.
Watch this fumble.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.379
Those are hurtful words.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.047
Man: Watch this.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.517
Announcer #1: Expect a salty
crowd today here in New York.

22:30.550 --> 22:34.086
They are displeased
with the 3-6 record.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.689
Keenum's in the shotgun.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.558
Good pocket to throw from.

22:38.591 --> 22:42.562
He launches.
Britt, one hand!

22:42.595 --> 22:44.931
Let's go, babe!

22:44.964 --> 22:48.835
Let's prove these
8-year-olds wrong! [ Laughs ]

22:48.868 --> 22:52.138
Announcer #1:
Kendricks still in the game
as a tight end, attached right.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.540
Keenum was under center.

22:53.573 --> 22:54.941
He pitches right,
Benny Cunningham.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.611
Good block, babe. Good block.
Good block.

22:58.645 --> 23:01.681
Announcer #1:
25, 20, 15, 10, Benny!

23:01.714 --> 23:03.916
Give it to him! Hey, check it!
Check it! Check it!

23:03.950 --> 23:07.420
He's out inside the 1,
inside the 1.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.923
It's zero.
It's zero!

23:10.957 --> 23:13.059
Narrator:
The offense has an early chance

23:13.092 --> 23:15.928
to make good on the adjustments
they made in practice.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.800
Announcer #1:
Keenum throws, near sideline.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.535
It's caught by
Lance Kendricks,

23:22.569 --> 23:24.904
who dropped a touchdown
last week in the fourth quarter.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.506
Damn.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.707
Announcer #1:
They tried to hook him up there.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.908
Instead, it's third and goal.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.677
Let's go!
Let's go!

23:30.710 --> 23:32.445
Keenum in the shotgun from
the 2, third down and goal.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.548
Quick throw, left side.
It's low. It's incomplete.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.716
Field goal.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.685
They drive inside
the 1-yard line,

23:38.718 --> 23:42.054
and the Rams will have to settle
for a field-goal attempt.

23:42.088 --> 23:45.091
Why you didn't reach
that...out, bro?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.026
I thought I was in!

23:47.059 --> 23:48.795
...that.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.897
Narrator:
The Rams manage only 3 points

23:50.930 --> 23:53.132
in the next three quarters,

23:53.165 --> 23:55.635
but the defense
keeps them in the game.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.941
When it's this tight, field
position can mean everything.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.846
He's throwing this
as far as he can.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.981
Announcer #1: Johnny Hekker
ready to kick it away

24:09.015 --> 24:12.118
to Jalin Marshall,
who stands at his 36.

24:14.654 --> 24:18.124
Hekker just obliterated
the football.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.659
Oh, he killed it.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.529
That's a shot.
Oh, my God.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.163
Announcer #2:
Look at this punt --

24:24.196 --> 24:27.233
all the way back
to the 5-yard line.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.504
Nice.
Nice!

24:31.538 --> 24:35.074
Oh!
What a punt!

24:35.107 --> 24:39.546
Announcer #3:
And that just came up a 78-yard
punt and not much return.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.782
Way to go, guys!

24:42.815 --> 24:45.752
Narrator: The punt has
flipped the field.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.754
The Rams get the ball back

24:47.787 --> 24:50.089
and attempt
a field goal for the lead.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.824
Announcer #1: Snap is good.
Hold is down.

24:51.858 --> 24:56.963
Kick is true, and it is good.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.865
That's where
we want to be.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.032
That's where we want to be.
Waiting on you guys.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.768
No other guys I'd want.

25:01.801 --> 25:05.638
No other guys
I'd want out there, all right?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.307
We got you,
Twinkle-toes!
Let's go, bub. Yeah!

25:08.340 --> 25:12.579
Come on, D!
Let's finish strong!

25:12.612 --> 25:15.648
Let's go home with this dub!
Let's go!

25:15.682 --> 25:17.684
Hey, heat purple!
Heat purple!

25:17.717 --> 25:20.052
Announcer #1: It is winning time
for the L.A. Rams defense --

25:20.086 --> 25:25.792
2-minute warning, protecting
a field-goal lead, 9-6.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.327
Bryce Petty takes the snap
as the Rams bring four.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.096
Throws midfield.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.032
Alec Ogletree steps in and rips
away an interception!

25:33.065 --> 25:34.801
The first turnover
of the game!

25:34.834 --> 25:38.771
It's Alec Ogletree
sealing a Rams victory!

25:38.805 --> 25:40.640
There you go, man!
I saw you took that...

25:40.673 --> 25:42.341
You took that...

25:42.374 --> 25:46.145
Announcer #1: It's Ogletree and
the defense delivering again.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.948
Announcer #2: Alec Ogletree
there just goes and runs

25:48.981 --> 25:51.884
the route for Quincy Enunwa.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.152
He jumps in front,

25:53.185 --> 25:55.588
does a great job
of fighting for the ball!

25:55.622 --> 25:58.090
Alec Ogletree!
Ogletree!

25:58.124 --> 25:59.692
Get him, Ogletree!

25:59.726 --> 26:02.094
Hey, we're 22.
It's victory.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.863
Victory!
Let's go, baby!

26:03.896 --> 26:05.698
Hey, Case!

26:05.732 --> 26:08.868
Case, go take a knee, baby!
Way to go!

26:08.901 --> 26:10.703
Yeah!

26:10.737 --> 26:13.039
Announcer #1: That'll be the
second game-clinching turnover

26:13.072 --> 26:14.607
for Alec Ogletree.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.342
Remember, in the first win
of the season,

26:16.375 --> 26:18.911
at home in the Coliseum against
Seattle, he recovered a fumble.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.681
Way to go, Tree!
Way to go, man!

26:21.714 --> 26:24.183
Hey, it's
about...time!

26:24.216 --> 26:27.687
Son of a...
Good job!

26:27.720 --> 26:31.023
Announcer #1:
The Rams are going to snap
a four-game losing streak.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.324
They're going to get
their fourth win.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.795
Way to go, boys!
Way to go!

26:35.828 --> 26:38.264
Announcer #1: And their defense
has been on the field late

26:38.297 --> 26:41.901
to decide the game
in all four of those wins.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.336
Danielle: We needed it.
We'll take it.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.405
I don't care how it's done.
We got it done.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.240
It was a good game.
Good game, though. Good game.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.643
Can I get a good game?
Good game. Good game, Jay.

26:50.677 --> 26:53.412
Good game. Good game.

26:53.445 --> 26:57.016
The four-game losing
streak is over for L.A.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.218
without the benefit
of a touchdown.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.387
Announcer #2: I don't know if
this kills the "Jared Goff,

27:01.420 --> 27:02.922
when is he going to start" stuff

27:02.955 --> 27:04.390
'cause you got
the victory on the road,

27:04.423 --> 27:06.893
but this was a great day
for this team, a great win.

27:06.926 --> 27:12.431
Now we get on this long flight
back with a win!

27:12.464 --> 27:16.168
Fisher: This emotion you're
feeling, it's called a win, huh?

27:16.202 --> 27:18.070
Yeah, baby!
Nice work.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.772
And, hey, wouldn't have
happened had you guys

27:19.806 --> 27:22.942
not hung in there and worked
and worked and worked.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.744
Great effort all
three phases, man.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.079
You found a way.
Tree, way to go, baby.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.881
Got a turnover.
We got a turnover!

27:28.915 --> 27:31.918
[ Cheers and applause ]

27:31.951 --> 27:35.021
Narrator: It's an important win
for a desperate team.

27:35.054 --> 27:38.691
So, otherwise,
baby, good job.

27:38.725 --> 27:42.795
Narrator: But there's no denying
the offense could use a change.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.396
Fisher has come to a decision,

27:44.430 --> 27:48.334
and back in L.A.,
he makes it official.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.336
It's time for Jared Goff.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.405
**

27:58.845 --> 28:01.213
Me and Case were sitting
in there and just watching film,

28:01.247 --> 28:03.349
and coach Fisher walks in

28:03.382 --> 28:05.217
and just tells both me and Case

28:05.251 --> 28:06.986
that he's going to start me in.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.955
I thought Case handled it
really well.

28:08.988 --> 28:13.760
You know, it was kind of
a surprise to me,

28:13.793 --> 28:15.995
but, yeah, that's football.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.764
Only one quarterback
can play at a time,

28:17.797 --> 28:19.732
and that's what's tough.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.104
Man #1:
Is this about the time that you
thought you may be called upon?

28:25.137 --> 28:26.773
Man #2: How was the message
delivered to you?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.775
Woman: How'd your teammates
react to you today?

28:28.808 --> 28:30.977
Man #3:
Sir, did you feel like this was
building, maybe since...

28:31.010 --> 28:33.412
Man #1:
When you talked with Case,
did he give you any kind of...

28:33.445 --> 28:35.514
Man #2: How frustrating was
that, being on the sidelines

28:35.547 --> 28:38.317
when this offense has
struggled so much to score?

28:40.452 --> 28:42.955
Man:
Jared, how do you kind of quell
that anxiety and excitement

28:42.989 --> 28:44.323
and everything
and try to stay even-keel

28:44.356 --> 28:45.925
once the game starts?
Anxiety's over.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.126
I'm good now. I'm excited.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.128
I'm confident and ready to go

28:49.161 --> 28:51.397
and ready to play, ready to get
back to playing football

28:51.430 --> 28:53.132
and get back to doing
what I love and my job

28:53.165 --> 28:56.803
and hopefully start what
will be a long career.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.037
Hut!

28:58.070 --> 29:00.940
Go! Go! Go!

29:00.973 --> 29:02.875
-Bang!
-Good.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.077
I like it.
Like it.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.979
Austin: How do you feel
about the switch, Coach?

29:07.013 --> 29:09.215
Good. I hate it.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.350
Kind of feel like
I failed the other guy.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.119
You know me.
I love people.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.421
I'm soft, and I'm about to start
crying thinking about it.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.890
You know what I mean?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.992
So, I'm disappointed
in that sense

29:20.026 --> 29:22.128
because I respect
the...out of Case

29:22.161 --> 29:23.796
and want him to succeed.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.065
I want all of us to succeed,
and when you guys don't,

29:26.098 --> 29:29.068
I feel like I've let you down.
You know what I mean?

29:29.101 --> 29:32.338
But what I'm excited about
is the next chapter

29:32.371 --> 29:33.806
and how you guys
support each other.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.808
When I see
you don't want each other,

29:35.842 --> 29:37.877
I ain't buying.
You know what I mean?

29:37.910 --> 29:40.579
And I know that you guys
feel bad for Case,

29:40.612 --> 29:43.182
but you're also excited
about what's happening.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.317
And you're going to
make sure Case is okay,

29:45.351 --> 29:47.820
but at the same time, you're
going to make sure 16 is okay.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.521
And I know you guys
got each other's back.

29:49.555 --> 29:50.957
That's why I love it
here so much.

29:50.990 --> 29:55.294
That's why I love
you guys, okay?

29:55.327 --> 29:58.230
Remember the last
preseason game?

29:58.264 --> 29:59.932
We flew back, moved in,

29:59.966 --> 30:02.468
and do you remember
the first meeting we had here?

30:02.501 --> 30:05.471
Remember the first thing
that we did?

30:05.504 --> 30:09.475
Voted for captains.

30:09.508 --> 30:14.180
You voted Case for captain
in that meeting.

30:14.213 --> 30:17.616
You are still captain,

30:17.649 --> 30:20.486

for your energy,

your commitment,

you've done to this point.

You know that.
Appreciate it.

Okay, it's your turn,
all right?

30:41.207 --> 30:44.343
Let's go somewhere.
We're going.

We're just
getting started, okay?

Goodell: Is that about
where you're going?

30:53.119 --> 30:54.220
Are you going to go...
Man #1: No. No.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.455
We're only about
25% of the way.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.325
You're only 25%
of the way down? Wow.

with a big basement.

Man #2: A stadium is not
a tricky building.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.638
It's a really
straightforward building.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.106
There's just
a lot of it,

31:14.140 --> 31:16.943
so we have a common
starting point

31:16.976 --> 31:20.980
so the excavation
will open up this way for us,

31:21.013 --> 31:23.649
and the foundations
will follow.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.284
The concrete
will follow.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.618
The steel will follow.

that way all the way up.

Constructing things right,

The Rams' new stadium
is being built on 300 acres

31:38.197 --> 31:41.633
in the revitalized
L.A. suburb of Inglewood.

It's scheduled to be ready
for the 2020 season.

When you get on the property,
it just seems so much bigger.

Kroenke: People don't realize
the scale of this thing.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.054
That's why I sort of want
to give credit

32:02.088 --> 32:03.722
for all the great
stadiums we've built,

32:03.755 --> 32:06.058
and Minnesota is amazing.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.626
But that is what,
in my view,

32:07.659 --> 32:11.697
has always made
the recent stadium development

32:11.730 --> 32:13.265
so great is that
you've got to build

32:13.299 --> 32:14.600
he stadium right
for that community.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.235
That's right,
but out here,

32:16.268 --> 32:18.037
it's what we need to do
to make that statement, right?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.738
Exactly.

a stadium will have been built

32:22.708 --> 32:25.544
for an NFL team
in Los Angeles.

Certainly, I can't go by

32:27.313 --> 32:29.348
and not mention
the fans of Los Angeles

32:29.381 --> 32:31.283
and California in general.

so overwhelming and warm

To build something that lasts,

33:18.564 --> 33:21.400
you've got to get
the cornerstone right.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.635
The Rams think they have,

33:23.669 --> 33:26.638
but it's a lot of weight
for a rookie,

33:26.672 --> 33:29.141
even more for a number one
overall pick

33:29.175 --> 33:30.709
because you're often compared

33:30.742 --> 33:33.612
to the quarterbacks
taken after you.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.747
Fellow rookies Carson Wentz
of the Eagles

33:35.781 --> 33:37.549
and Dak Prescott of the Cowboys

33:37.583 --> 33:39.451

since opening day.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.054
Both have winning records,

for Rookie Of The Year.

33:46.625 --> 33:51.130

has watched and waited.

Goff: I mean, I was antsy
the whole year.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.734
everyone wants to play,

33:55.767 --> 33:58.704
but again, I understood that
that was part of their decision,

33:58.737 --> 34:01.140
was to kind of hold off
as long as they could

34:01.173 --> 34:03.342
and just wait
for the right moment,

34:03.375 --> 34:05.277

34:05.311 --> 34:07.179
of course
I want to play Week 1,

I think it's fine,

34:08.514 --> 34:10.616

40:33.599 --> 40:34.900

been looking for.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.737
that we're going to see
the rest of the season?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.672

Yeah, baby!

Announcer #1: And, on the second
drive of the Jared Goff era,

40:46.211 --> 40:49.981
Todd Gurley gets his longest run
of the season,

40:50.015 --> 40:52.884
a 24-yard touchdown.
It's 7-0, L.A.

Hey, Wink,
let him celebrate,

41:01.893 --> 41:04.630
but he's got to
hear the huddle call.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.198
That was his favorite
...drop quick game

41:07.232 --> 41:09.100
that he wanted, okay?

41:09.134 --> 41:12.103
On the Omaha
twist dragon,

41:12.137 --> 41:13.905
he called it wrong,
just so you know,

41:13.939 --> 41:15.273
and you're looking
at picture four there.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.676
He called Omaha
twist stick, okay?

41:17.709 --> 41:19.945
Just so you guys know.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.113
Okay. All right.
Tell him sorry.

he's sorry, okay?
Thank you.

to start, right?

Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

Good place for him.

Narrator:
It's all new to the rookie,

41:57.215 --> 42:00.185
but for the Rams defense,
it's more of the same --

42:00.218 --> 42:02.854
another dominant performance.

Announcer #1:
He's back behind the line,

fisticuffs, a little battling

here and there --
just fired up guys,

42:41.760 --> 42:44.830
but, man, what a shot
by Mo Alexander.

42:44.863 --> 42:47.032
You know we're good
with the intensity,

42:47.065 --> 42:49.234
Like, down here, I thought
this is a good hit,

42:49.267 --> 42:51.069
and it's a great hit,
and it's really not worth it,

42:51.102 --> 42:53.605
but then when you start
yelling, "...Your mother!"

42:53.639 --> 42:55.040
somebody's
going to turn.

Joyner -- I think it was Joyner,
because I looked,

but when we go,
"That's the extension there,"

I'm cool with -- you know that,
with the emotion.

43:01.947 --> 43:04.315
We got to just cut it
when it's cut

43:04.349 --> 43:05.851
and then wait 20 seconds

43:05.884 --> 43:07.719

the next play,

looking at language,

43:48.994 --> 43:51.997
Narrator:
The early score is standing up,

43:52.030 --> 43:54.132
mostly because
the defense refuses

43:54.165 --> 43:55.934
to let the Dolphins
off the turf.

Narrator: Goff's debut isn't
perfect, but it shows promise.

44:19.958 --> 44:22.861
There's a reason
he went number-one overall.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.265
Announcer #2: Jared Goff is
throwing the ball well.

44:27.298 --> 44:28.834
Announcer #1: No matter
how this game finishes,

44:28.867 --> 44:30.702
I think you have
to be encouraged

44:30.736 --> 44:34.172
by the pocket presence of the
rookie Q.B. making his debut.

He's had some guys in his face,

44:40.178 --> 44:42.914
and is still able
to get the ball out.

44:42.948 --> 44:46.351
Narrator: But all that promise
doesn't produce many points.

44:46.384 --> 44:48.219
After their
first-quarter touchdown,

44:48.253 --> 44:50.922
the Rams manage
just a field goal.

You're trying to do
too much, man.

the fourth quarter,

to protect a 10-0 lead.

sensational again,

45:25.523 --> 45:27.859
from Week 7 through now, 11,

45:27.893 --> 45:30.328
the Rams have allowed
the fewest points in the NFL

45:30.361 --> 45:34.265
and the second fewest yards
per game in the NFL.

Tannehill and the Dolphins
have not mustered

45:36.567 --> 45:38.336
anything offensively
in the second half.

Narrator:
But fatigue is setting in.

by the Dolphins' effort.

46:03.895 --> 46:06.531

at about the 3-yard line,

46:06.564 --> 46:09.234
but Jarvis Landry
never stopped,

of about eight people

hit the perimeter
