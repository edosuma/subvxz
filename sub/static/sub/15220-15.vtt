'Theorising that one could time
travel within his own lifetime,

00:28.629 --> 00:32.031
Doctor Sam Beckett stepped into
the quantum leap accelerator -

00:32.031 --> 00:34.114
and vanished!

00:38.318 --> 00:41.081
He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.081 --> 00:44.685
facing mirror images
that were not his own

00:44.685 --> 00:48.809
and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:50.010 --> 00:54.254
His only guide on this journey is
Al, an observer from his own time

00:54.254 --> 00:56.857
who appears
in the form of a hologram

00:56.857 --> 00:59.139
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.139 --> 01:03.504
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.504 --> 01:06.507
striving to put right
what once went wrong

01:06.507 --> 01:09.109
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:10.190 --> 01:12.272
..will be the leap home.'

(CLEARS THROAT) Thank you.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.083
(DRUM MACHINE)

01:31.491 --> 01:33.534
Thank... Thank you.

01:34.935 --> 01:37.538
(DRUM MACHINE STOPS)
Thank you. Thank you.

01:37.538 --> 01:41.461
That's one of the favourite songs
of mine and I'm sure one of yours,

01:41.461 --> 01:44.304
and that's...Feelings?
Feelings. Feelings.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.227
Yes, well,
about now would be a good time

01:47.227 --> 01:50.470
to take a pause for the old cause,
so I...

01:50.470 --> 01:52.873
Play Somewhere for me.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.519
Where?

01:59.760 --> 02:02.322
Well, you can play it
back at my place...

02:03.443 --> 02:05.646
..but I don't have a piano.

02:05.646 --> 02:08.769
(CHUCKLES)
She's talking about a song.

02:08.769 --> 02:11.892
Uh-uh. Your song.

02:11.892 --> 02:14.454
The one you wrote. Come on, Chuck.

02:16.577 --> 02:18.619
Do it for me.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.986
Oh, boy.

05:22.763 --> 05:24.805
Thank you.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.341
I need another drink.
 Frank!

05:30.543 --> 05:34.507
That was a song
for all of you lovers out there,

05:34.507 --> 05:36.749
who have lost in love.

05:36.749 --> 05:38.711
And here's another one.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.676
You put lyrics to it.

05:45.157 --> 05:48.120
Er, well, er, yeah.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.163
I mean, I figured
that if I was gonna sing it,

05:51.163 --> 05:54.727
I'd probably be better with lyrics,
so I wrote them.

05:54.727 --> 05:57.610
I thought I was the lyricist
in the act. (SNIFFS)

05:58.811 --> 06:00.853
I guess a lot changes
after three years.

06:03.976 --> 06:06.739
This was a mistake.
I'll be right back, folks.

06:06.739 --> 06:08.901
I just wanna know
why you walked out. Ow!

06:08.901 --> 06:12.385
It's not important now.
Yes, it it... No, it isn't.

06:13.666 --> 06:15.428
I'm sorry.

06:15.428 --> 06:19.031
Watch it. Careful. Careful.
Don't touch it. It's all right.

06:19.031 --> 06:21.273
I've been looking for you
for months.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.476
Why don't you shut up
and let him play?

06:23.476 --> 06:26.439
Because I need to talk to him.

06:26.439 --> 06:29.682
He's a piano player, not a shrink.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.724
You're dead.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.847
Excuse me. I'm gonna take a little
break right now.

06:34.847 --> 06:37.810
OK, and I'll be back in a minute.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:39.011 --> 06:41.053
Here you go.

06:44.136 --> 06:47.860
Don't mind Janelle, she gets really
territorial when she drinks.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.542
(CHUCKLES)

06:49.542 --> 06:51.664
So what'll it be, Chuck?

06:51.664 --> 06:54.026
Coffee? That'd be fine.

06:54.026 --> 06:55.428
Two.

06:58.391 --> 07:01.313
The whole time I was driving,
I kept telling myself,

07:01.313 --> 07:04.156
'Lorraine, turn the car around.
Just turn around...'

07:06.439 --> 07:08.961
I'm so sorry.
Well, don't worry about it.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.123
A quick skin graft,
it'll be good as new (!)

07:11.123 --> 07:13.125
It's OK, it's OK. I'm such a klutz.

07:13.125 --> 07:16.529
No, no, no you're not. Not...really.

07:19.452 --> 07:21.574
Thanks.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.536
Yeah.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.784
Why didn't you say goodbye?

07:33.546 --> 07:35.588
Why did you just walk
out on my life?

07:36.989 --> 07:39.792
You slimy lounge lizard.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.675
You've only been working
on the circuit for five minutes,

07:42.675 --> 07:46.158
and you've already got a woman -
It's not what you think. Isn't it?

07:46.158 --> 07:49.281
Your name is Chuck Danner,
lounge lizard extraordinaire.

07:49.281 --> 07:51.884
I think, three years ago,
you didn't wanna marry me.

07:51.884 --> 07:54.046
And that's why I ran away?

07:54.046 --> 07:57.129
I haven't the foggiest.
What else could I think?

07:57.129 --> 08:00.373
Well... There's no birth
certificate, no Social Security...

08:00.373 --> 08:03.816
Why else would you disappear?
I - Not even a mailing list.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.138
I - Why else
would you change your name?

08:06.138 --> 08:09.462
Ah, that's it. You changed your
name. We gotta get your real name.

08:09.462 --> 08:12.144
I need some answers
so I can get on with my life,

08:12.144 --> 08:13.826
because I've met someone else.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.988
Took her three years.

08:15.988 --> 08:18.150
Someone else?

08:18.150 --> 08:21.714
His name is Carl Morgan
and he's very successful

08:21.714 --> 08:23.996
and he doesn't live on the road.

08:23.996 --> 08:26.358
Most important,
he loves me very much.

08:26.358 --> 08:30.162
I wonder why she's sitting
on a bar stool next to you.

08:31.283 --> 08:33.125
Good point.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.246
Good point?

08:35.246 --> 08:38.049
If you love him, why are you here?

08:38.049 --> 08:40.893
Carl wanted to be sure
there weren't any ghosts.

08:40.893 --> 08:42.975
That's Carl's first mistake.

08:42.975 --> 08:46.939
He said we couldn't start on our new
life until we were sure it was over.

08:51.263 --> 08:53.305
So is it?

08:56.348 --> 08:58.471
Well, I... I don't...

08:58.471 --> 09:00.713
Well, I guess that answers it.
I er...

09:00.713 --> 09:03.876
I just wanna know
why you didn't even say goodbye.

09:05.678 --> 09:09.522
Look, we should talk about that,
but -

09:09.522 --> 09:12.645
But? But I've got another set to do

09:12.645 --> 09:15.207
so, if you could just wait here,

09:15.207 --> 09:17.370
then, when I'm done, we'll talk, OK?

09:17.370 --> 09:20.933
OK, but I promised Carl
that I would call him

09:20.933 --> 09:22.695
and let him know I'm all right.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.336
All right.

09:26.659 --> 09:29.702
(BEEPING) Maybe I'm here
to put this couple back together.

09:29.702 --> 09:34.226
Or maybe break 'em up, so she and
Carl can live happily ever after.

09:34.226 --> 09:37.630
We're never gonna know anything
until we find out who I am, right?

09:37.630 --> 09:41.554
No, all we know is you're
Chuck Danner, who you're not,

09:41.554 --> 09:44.517
and you're entertaining in a lounge
in Tularosa, New Mexico,

09:44.517 --> 09:46.278
November 10th 1985.

09:46.278 --> 09:48.441
What's the guy saying
in the waiting room?

09:48.441 --> 09:52.445
He insists that he's Chuck Danner,
lounge lizard extraordinaire.

09:52.445 --> 09:55.007
It's all right, I've found him.

09:55.007 --> 09:58.010
He's playing a place called
the Roadside Rendezvous,

09:58.010 --> 09:59.772
near Tularosa, New Mexico.

09:59.772 --> 10:02.214
So what's happened?
Nothing's happened.

10:02.214 --> 10:03.936
We're waiting to talk.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.298
Three years
and he's still got you waiting?

10:06.298 --> 10:09.902
He has to finish his set first.
He's been very nice.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.824
How nice?

10:11.824 --> 10:13.866
Just...nice.

10:13.866 --> 10:16.068
Carl, please don't worry.

10:16.068 --> 10:18.911
Look, this was a mistake,
I want you to come home.

10:18.911 --> 10:23.115
This was your idea. I know, but
I think you should come home now.

10:23.115 --> 10:25.598
I will. Now stop worrying, OK?

10:25.598 --> 10:29.001
It's just hard when you're with
a guy you were crazy in love with.

10:29.001 --> 10:31.003
That was a long time ago.

10:32.765 --> 10:36.088
You have to trust me. 
OK, OK.

10:36.088 --> 10:39.051
Just get him outta your system
and come back to me.

10:39.051 --> 10:42.895
I want this whole thing finished,
so we can get married. Me too.

10:42.895 --> 10:44.937
You fly good tomorrow.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.380
Come home and I'll fly better.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.422
I love you...

10:51.984 --> 10:54.066
(COINS DROP)
..I think.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.831
(CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC)

11:33.265 --> 11:35.428
(APPLAUSE)

11:35.428 --> 11:38.831
Play it again, Sam.
I always wanted to say that.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.715
Thank you and good night.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.159
You know, if you'd stayed in town,
you'd have been recording.

11:47.159 --> 11:48.961
Do you think?

11:48.961 --> 11:51.604
Yes, you would have signed
that deal,

11:51.604 --> 11:53.766
and we would have gotten married.

11:53.766 --> 11:55.728
Ooh, take your shot, Sam.

11:55.728 --> 11:59.131
And that would have made you Mrs...
De Nardo. ..De Nardo, yeah.

11:59.131 --> 12:02.415
That's one out of two.
It's a lot better than Danner.

12:02.415 --> 12:05.257
Why did you change it?
It's kind of a long story.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.740
You know how hard it was
to find you?

12:07.740 --> 12:11.303
Yeah, well, I can imagine.
MAN: Come on, move it out.

12:11.303 --> 12:14.547
But I knew you'd never give up
your music. WOMAN: Good night.

12:14.547 --> 12:17.670
So I thought,
where would you never go?

12:19.031 --> 12:21.754
And then I remembered
how much you hated these lounges,

12:21.754 --> 12:23.916
so I gave it a shot.

12:25.157 --> 12:27.400
Chuck, I need a big favour.

12:28.721 --> 12:30.883
Janelle wants me to take her home,

12:30.883 --> 12:34.967
so how's about I borrow your wheels
for a few hours?

12:34.967 --> 12:37.370
Yeah, OK.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.456
Here you go. Thanks.

12:43.456 --> 12:46.459
Where are you parked? Outside.

12:46.459 --> 12:48.581
Well, that narrows it down (!)

12:48.581 --> 12:50.663
See you in the morning.

12:58.471 --> 13:01.353
Joey, you never used to let anybody
touch your car.

13:01.353 --> 13:03.516
Joey, bingo.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.519
Been a long time since
anybody's called me by that name.

13:06.519 --> 13:12.485
OK, Joey De Nardo was born
in...Chicago in December 1950

13:12.485 --> 13:15.968
and-and he died when...

13:15.968 --> 13:17.690
(EXPLOSION)

13:17.690 --> 13:19.812
(CONCERNED CHATTER)

13:19.812 --> 13:22.415
..when his car was bombed

13:22.415 --> 13:25.337
in a parking lot in Tularosa,
New Mexico.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.148
Oh, my God!

13:37.990 --> 13:40.032
That was meant for you.

13:53.649 --> 13:56.412
Who was trying to kill me?
My guess is that's him.

13:59.575 --> 14:01.697
Sam! Oh, God!

14:01.697 --> 14:03.699
Oh, no. You've been shot.

14:03.699 --> 14:05.181
(SQUEALS)

14:05.181 --> 14:07.022
Go, get outta here!
I won't leave you.

14:07.022 --> 14:08.744
Go get your car!

14:17.513 --> 14:19.635
Go!

14:19.635 --> 14:22.278
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

14:55.070 --> 14:56.792
Is it bad? I don't think so.

14:56.792 --> 15:00.316
It looks like the bullet passed
clean through the lateral quadricep.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.438
The what?

15:02.438 --> 15:04.760
Give me your scarf.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.762
Come on.

15:10.526 --> 15:12.728
Are you OK? Yes.

15:12.728 --> 15:15.411
But those people -
those people are dead.

15:15.411 --> 15:17.613
Those people could have been you
two.

15:17.613 --> 15:19.775
You've changed history, Sam. Dead!

15:19.775 --> 15:22.498
Because the guy you leapt into -
Joey...

15:22.498 --> 15:26.422
Yeah, that guy, he was originally
killed by that car bomb.

15:26.422 --> 15:29.104
..this is all my fault.
No, it isn't.

15:30.546 --> 15:32.748
Is it? Yes. No.

15:32.748 --> 15:36.392
No, Joey De Nardo and Lorraine
were a hot lounge act,

15:36.392 --> 15:39.595
in Chicago until you disappeared,
three years ago.

15:39.595 --> 15:42.398
Why? Because of my jinx.

15:42.398 --> 15:45.601
Because you saw someone get whacked.

15:45.601 --> 15:48.684
I saw somebody get murdered?
I know, it was horrible.

15:48.684 --> 15:51.327
That poor bartender,
that poor girl...

15:51.327 --> 15:53.289
Even though she was real mean.

15:53.289 --> 15:56.252
No, not them, some moustache
named Ponti.

15:56.252 --> 15:59.775
Now get this, Sam,
you and this Ponti

15:59.775 --> 16:03.139
and a guy named Nick Bellini
all grew up together

16:03.139 --> 16:05.221
in the same neighbourhood.

16:05.221 --> 16:07.903
They went into the mob
and you went into music.

16:07.903 --> 16:10.146
Later on,
they had a falling out, see?

16:10.146 --> 16:13.629
And this Nick used you
to set up Ponti.

16:13.629 --> 16:17.513
So I saw Ponti get killed? Yeah, and
you've been running ever since.

16:17.513 --> 16:19.475
You saw Ponti murdered
three years ago?

16:19.475 --> 16:21.757
That's why you ran away. I guess so.

16:21.757 --> 16:24.280
It wasn't because of me.
I guess not.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.402
Oh, Joey.
(HORN HONKS)

16:26.402 --> 16:30.406
(SQUEALS) I'm sorry.
Tell her to say she's sorry later.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.728
Ziggy says this is 90 seconds
behind us

16:32.728 --> 16:34.890
and the two of you
are gonna get killed

16:34.890 --> 16:37.012
when we pass milepost 257.

16:38.734 --> 16:42.338
Oh, Joey, I'm so relieved that it
wasn't me you were running from.

16:42.338 --> 16:44.580
All these years,
I thought it was me.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.422
After all, I'm a terrible klutz.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.783
What?

16:47.783 --> 16:49.945
Nothing, just keep driving.

16:49.945 --> 16:52.588
Oh, God. I almost forgot.
Is he still behind us?

16:52.588 --> 16:54.590
Yeah, and he's gaining.

17:06.682 --> 17:08.844
What's wrong? What's wrong? Oh, God.

17:08.844 --> 17:11.166
What? Not again. What? What?

17:11.166 --> 17:13.209
I think I'm running out of gas.

17:37.273 --> 17:40.596
Great. That worked
just like in a Western movie.

17:40.596 --> 17:42.638
OK, come on.

17:50.686 --> 17:53.809
Now, we gotta figure out
some way to get some gasoline.

18:02.097 --> 18:04.340
MAN: How the hell
did you get out the ditch?

18:04.340 --> 18:07.903
Yeah, well, we got lucky, Sheriff.
Coffee.

18:07.903 --> 18:09.985
Two cowboys came along
and pulled us out.

18:09.985 --> 18:12.148
They even had a tank full of gas.

18:12.148 --> 18:14.430
All right, you stay there
at Thelma's.

18:14.430 --> 18:17.153
Thelma's? I thought this was Polly's?

18:17.153 --> 18:19.315
Thelma owns it. Oh, OK.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.597
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
Yeah, all right.

18:21.597 --> 18:23.639
We'll be here, Sheriff. Thanks.

18:26.562 --> 18:29.605
I'm so sorry.
I guess I'm a bit nervous.

18:29.605 --> 18:33.209
It happens to my little
grandaughter all the time.

18:33.209 --> 18:35.331
How much do we owe you?

18:35.331 --> 18:38.214
Oh, er, four early bird specials

18:38.214 --> 18:40.616
with two pieces of cherry pie...

18:40.616 --> 18:42.738
$6.50.

18:42.738 --> 18:44.860
Well, here.

18:44.860 --> 18:46.902

Yeah, you do it good.

22:03.699 --> 22:05.781
You should get yourself an act.

22:13.068 --> 22:14.750
Did I say something?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.793
No. No, we er...

22:17.793 --> 22:20.996
We had an act, about three years ago.

22:20.996 --> 22:22.758
Oh.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.040
Well, you ought to put it back
together.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.563
Hm, yeah.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.645
Yeah, thanks.

22:43.619 --> 22:46.502
Lorraine, now, come on.

22:46.502 --> 22:49.104
Listen, everything's gonna be OK.

22:49.104 --> 22:52.548
I called the Sheriff.
He's gonna pick up Nicky -

22:52.548 --> 22:55.751
Nicky? Nicky Bellini,
the guy who's trying to kill me.

22:55.751 --> 22:58.994
It won't make any difference.
Of course it will.

22:58.994 --> 23:01.116
No, I'm a jinx.

23:01.116 --> 23:02.958
No, you're not.

23:02.958 --> 23:05.040
Remember all the terrible things

23:05.040 --> 23:07.683
that happened to you,
when we started dating?

23:09.965 --> 23:12.128
Well, er...

23:12.128 --> 23:14.290
No, not really.

23:14.290 --> 23:17.413
How could you forget the ornament
I bought you for your tree?

23:18.574 --> 23:22.658
The ornament? The arson investigator
said it started the whole thing.

23:22.658 --> 23:24.820
And the time we went to California.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.102
It was a great trip.

23:27.102 --> 23:29.585
Except your luggage went to Iran.

23:29.585 --> 23:33.149
Ha! Well, you know,
there's a good side to that.

23:33.149 --> 23:35.151
I mean, I could've gone with it.

23:36.272 --> 23:38.434
And how about our ski trip?

23:38.434 --> 23:40.476
You broke both legs.

23:43.159 --> 23:46.001
Well, it was my fault,
I shouldn't have fallen.

23:46.001 --> 23:48.844
You wouldn't have fallen
if I hadn't skied into you.

23:50.005 --> 23:52.168
Come on, now,
you didn't do it on purpose.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.133
I'm a jinx
and I'm gonna get you killed.

23:57.133 --> 23:59.695
Now, Lorraine, come on -
I have to call Carl.

24:10.506 --> 24:14.150
And here comes Petey Jones
in this last qualifying heat.

24:17.433 --> 24:20.035
Don't forget, folks,
the big race is tomorrow.

24:20.035 --> 24:23.199
Were you hurt?
No, I'm fine, we got away.

24:23.199 --> 24:25.481
That's it, Lorraine,
I want you home.

24:25.481 --> 24:28.324
Maybe you're right.
You're damn right I'm right.

24:28.324 --> 24:31.727
I mean, really...
mobsters trying to kill you?

24:31.727 --> 24:35.211
Not me, Joey. Who you're with?

24:35.211 --> 24:37.133
Carl, I said that I'm all right.

24:37.133 --> 24:40.216
Where are you now?
A little diner outside of Vadito.

24:40.216 --> 24:42.658
Right, I'll call the Sheriff.
Joey already did.

24:42.658 --> 24:44.900
Then there's no reason
for you to stay.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.582
I have to wait for the Sheriff.

24:46.582 --> 24:48.984
I love you and
I can't stand the thought of you

24:48.984 --> 24:51.827
being with a man that doesn't care
whether you live or die.

24:51.827 --> 24:54.710
He saved my life.
He saved his own life.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.752
If Joey really cared about you,

24:56.752 --> 24:59.275
he'd get you as far from that mess
as possible.

24:59.275 --> 25:02.037
Every minute you're there,
your life's in danger.

25:02.037 --> 25:04.960
But Joey said - Joey is
the cause of all your grief.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.682
This isn't his fault.

25:06.682 --> 25:09.965
Then whose is it? Mine, I guess.

25:09.965 --> 25:12.688
Yours? I'm a jinx, Carl.

25:12.688 --> 25:15.010
I've always been a jinx. Not for me.

25:16.212 --> 25:18.694
When have you ever been a jinx
for me?

25:18.694 --> 25:21.177
Never, I guess.

25:21.177 --> 25:23.659
I want you to come home, Lorraine.

25:23.659 --> 25:25.741
Lorraine?

25:27.583 --> 25:29.705
I need a little more time.

25:29.705 --> 25:31.787
Right, how much time?

25:31.787 --> 25:33.869
Until I know that Joey's safe.

25:33.869 --> 25:36.031
You're not his mother, Lorraine.

25:36.031 --> 25:38.514
Right, when the Sheriff comes,
I'll leave.

25:38.514 --> 25:40.596
You promise? Promise.

25:42.478 --> 25:44.880
I love you. I love you too.

25:48.284 --> 25:50.686
Sam, you gotta get outta here.

25:50.686 --> 25:53.369
Al, would you just relax, OK?

25:53.369 --> 25:55.531
(MUTTERS)

25:55.531 --> 25:57.933
Everything's fine,
I called the Sheriff.

25:57.933 --> 26:01.137
He's gonna be here in 10 minutes.
You're gonna be dead in eight.

26:01.137 --> 26:03.179
Both of you.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.683
You both get killed. What do
you mean, we both get killed?

26:12.683 --> 26:14.605
What do you mean,
'What do I mean...'?

26:14.605 --> 26:17.087
I mean you get killed, as in dead.

26:17.087 --> 26:19.449
As in morti, kaput, finito,
the big sleep.

26:19.449 --> 26:22.733
But Ziggy said that was supposed
to happen round milepost 257.

26:22.733 --> 26:25.175
Now it happens here.
You changed history,

26:25.175 --> 26:27.097
now it's coming back
to bite you in the -

26:27.097 --> 26:30.621
The Sheriff is coming. He's coming
to clean up Nicky's mess.

26:30.621 --> 26:33.584
What's this guy got?
A police radio, or something?

26:33.584 --> 26:36.066
I don't know,
your guess is as good as mine.

26:36.066 --> 26:39.550
OK, from now on, no more police.
Al, we need a plan.

26:39.550 --> 26:42.993
Ziggy says to get the hell
outta Dodge. That's not a plan.

26:42.993 --> 26:46.997
I had a fencing teacher once that
said the best defence was distance.

26:46.997 --> 26:50.240
Get some distance and then
we'll make a plan. All right.

26:52.442 --> 26:54.244
Lorraine, we gotta get going.

26:54.244 --> 26:55.966
The Sheriff's coming. Come on.

26:55.966 --> 26:58.208
We can't wait for him. Why not?

26:58.208 --> 27:00.571
Well, I've got this sixth sense.
Thank you.

27:00.571 --> 27:04.414
It's telling me that the Sheriff
isn't gonna get here in time.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.337
It's telling you to get the hell
outta here. How do you know?

27:07.337 --> 27:10.140
Because we've been shot at, nearly
blown up, ran out of gas

27:10.140 --> 27:13.263
and barely escaped being caught
by a lunatic who wants us dead.

27:13.263 --> 27:15.425
I'll catch up with you later.

27:15.425 --> 27:18.268
Isn't that reason enough?
But where are we going?

27:21.351 --> 27:23.393
Somewhere Nicky can't find us.

27:32.803 --> 27:34.845
(TYRES SCREECH)

27:45.455 --> 27:47.578
Do you think we lost him?

27:47.578 --> 27:49.740
Yeah, I hope so.

27:49.740 --> 27:52.703
It's funny, you think about
so many things in life,

27:52.703 --> 27:56.066
and I never thought about this -
about dying.

27:56.066 --> 27:58.709
Not like this, I mean. Did you?

27:59.790 --> 28:01.672
We're not gonna die.

28:01.672 --> 28:05.115
You wouldn't have yanked me outta
that diner if you didn't think so.

28:05.115 --> 28:10.080
Well, I just felt
that distance was our best defence.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.523
Yeah, right.

28:15.205 --> 28:18.048
You know, I always wished
we'd gone to Hawaii.

28:18.048 --> 28:21.131
They've got
some great lounges there.

28:21.131 --> 28:23.494
We could have found one,
settled down,

28:23.494 --> 28:25.656
bought a little place
on the beach...

28:25.656 --> 28:27.818
Paid a zillion dollars for it.

28:27.818 --> 28:30.981
And lived happily in debt
ever after.

28:33.383 --> 28:35.546
At least we'd be off the road.

28:35.546 --> 28:37.708
That's one thing
that I wouldn't miss.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.950
Would you?

28:39.950 --> 28:42.833
Well, no, actually,
I wouldn't miss the road at all.

28:42.833 --> 28:44.955
In fact,

28:44.955 --> 28:48.278
I wouldn't mind having a place
I could call home for a while.

28:48.278 --> 28:50.400
I could wear a grass skirt.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.523
(LAUGHS)

28:52.523 --> 28:54.765
Yeah, yeah.

28:54.765 --> 28:59.089
And I could bring you fresh coconut
milk for breakfast.

28:59.089 --> 29:03.734
And we could lie on the beach
in the sun all day, writing songs.

29:03.734 --> 29:06.897
Poring over our $1 million
recording contracts.

29:06.897 --> 29:09.740
We would never have to do anything
we didn't wanna do

29:09.740 --> 29:11.742
for the rest of our lives.

29:14.905 --> 29:16.947
I'll buy that.

29:27.718 --> 29:29.880
Oh, boy!

29:29.880 --> 29:32.923
This is all my fault,
now he's gonna kill us here.

29:34.364 --> 29:36.527
No he won't.

29:36.527 --> 29:40.010
We'll just get the tyre changed,
then we'll be outta here.

29:40.010 --> 29:42.052
Tyre?

29:43.453 --> 29:46.096
I've been meaning to fix that tyre.

29:46.096 --> 29:48.218
It's flat.

29:48.218 --> 29:50.300
The tyre's...

29:51.421 --> 29:53.544
I know, I know, you're sorry.

29:53.544 --> 29:55.866
But I really am sorry.

30:03.033 --> 30:05.075

30:08.198 --> 30:10.240
(JANGLING)

30:23.614 --> 30:25.736
I'll be right back. OK.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.498
Look like you got yourself a flat.

30:27.498 --> 30:29.219
Yeah. I need to get a new tyre.

30:29.219 --> 30:32.022
How much? Why didn't you just
put on the spare?

30:32.022 --> 30:34.024
Well, cos the spare is flat too.

30:34.024 --> 30:35.826
You gotta watch that.

30:35.826 --> 30:39.269
I could patch that one up for you
until you get yourself a new wheel,

30:39.269 --> 30:42.072
cos that one's shot. I don't
have time for you to fix it.

30:42.072 --> 30:44.194
I gotta get outta here right away.

30:44.194 --> 30:46.236
See, er...

30:47.437 --> 30:49.600
I'm late for a wedding, see.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.603
I'm the best man
and...my girlfriend is...

30:54.044 --> 30:57.608
I fell down while I was trying to
change a tyre and I cut my leg -

30:57.608 --> 31:01.852
I'm sure I have something that will
work, but it will cost you $80.

31:01.852 --> 31:05.576
80 bucks? Hey, you're free
to shop the competition.

31:07.818 --> 31:09.860
OK, all right, OK.

31:11.101 --> 31:13.263
Let's do it. I'll help you.

31:13.263 --> 31:14.905
Let's move it.

31:16.026 --> 31:19.029
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the Midwest...

31:19.029 --> 31:23.353
Lorraine! You said you were coming
home when the Sheriff got there.

31:23.353 --> 31:25.596
He didn't get there. What?

31:25.596 --> 31:28.318
Well, we sorta left early.

31:28.318 --> 31:30.440
What do you mean, you left?

31:30.440 --> 31:32.603
Joey thought we were in danger.

31:32.603 --> 31:34.925
So he took you back out on the
road?!

31:34.925 --> 31:36.607
We had no choice.

31:36.607 --> 31:40.250
That's it, Lorraine, I can't put up
with this any more.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.933
Where are you?
I don't know, some gas station.

31:42.933 --> 31:45.656
Where? I guess it's after Taos.

31:45.656 --> 31:48.058
OK, OK, OK, now listen to me.

31:48.058 --> 31:50.941
There's a little airport
north of Taos.

31:50.941 --> 31:54.144
It's about - Carl -
Just listen to me, please.

31:54.144 --> 31:58.428
I want Joey to drive you to
the airport as fast as he can.

31:58.428 --> 32:00.190
I'll meet you there.

32:00.190 --> 32:03.313
What about your race? Screw
the race, I don't want you hurt.

32:03.313 --> 32:05.476
You understand? No.

32:05.476 --> 32:07.998
You've been preparing for this race
for months.

32:07.998 --> 32:10.080
I won't let you ruin your chances.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.162
And I won't let you ruin our lives.

32:12.162 --> 32:14.525
Lorraine, promise you'll meet me
there.

32:14.525 --> 32:16.286
Lorraine!

32:16.286 --> 32:17.928
What?

32:17.928 --> 32:20.010
Promise to meet me at the airport.

32:21.852 --> 32:23.734
Sam, it's not gonna work.

32:23.734 --> 32:26.977
I had Ziggy run the numbers and
you can't hide in the mountains.

32:26.977 --> 32:29.099
Why not?
Because he'll find you there.

32:29.099 --> 32:30.861
(HUMS)

32:30.861 --> 32:33.263
I'm just gonna have to face him,
I guess.

32:33.263 --> 32:35.666
No, you only have
a 3% chance of winning.

32:35.666 --> 32:37.828
I can't run from him forever, Al.

32:37.828 --> 32:40.430
The only way
you're gonna get out of this,

32:40.430 --> 32:44.274
is you gotta get rid of
Miss Lucky Charm here.

32:44.274 --> 32:46.356
(BANGING)

32:47.758 --> 32:49.760
How's it going?

32:49.760 --> 32:51.962
Pretty good,
I think he's almost done.

32:51.962 --> 32:54.044
How's Carl?

32:55.566 --> 32:57.688
He's a little upset. Yeah.

32:57.688 --> 33:00.170
He wants us to meet him
at some little airport.

33:00.170 --> 33:03.173
It's just... That's perfect.
That's a great idea.

33:04.655 --> 33:08.098
It is? Yeah. Yeah, listen,
I've been thinking

33:08.098 --> 33:12.503
that maybe it would be better if
we split up for a while, you know,

33:12.503 --> 33:15.345
until everything's OK, OK?

33:16.466 --> 33:18.268
No.

33:18.268 --> 33:20.390
It's not OK.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.553
I don't wanna leave you.

33:22.553 --> 33:25.355
The only way to get rid of this one
is to play hardball, Sam.

33:25.355 --> 33:27.117
Pick a fight.

33:27.117 --> 33:29.880
Pi... Don't squirm on me, Sam.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.762
You gotta do it to save her life.

33:31.762 --> 33:33.924
Lorraine... Be tough.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.086
Tough.

33:36.086 --> 33:39.049
This isn't working out.
That's tough (!)

33:39.049 --> 33:40.811
What are you saying?

33:40.811 --> 33:42.693
She doesn't mean a thing to you,
Sam.

33:42.693 --> 33:44.294
I... It was just a fling.

33:45.455 --> 33:47.738
I need some time,
to think things over.

33:47.738 --> 33:49.900
I understand that.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.583
I just stroll into your life
after three years,

33:52.583 --> 33:55.065
you need a little time
to figure things out.

33:55.065 --> 33:57.908
Well, yeah. It doesn't mean
we have to be apart.

33:57.908 --> 34:00.430
Ditch her, Sam. She's ready to go.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.633
OK, thanks.

34:02.633 --> 34:05.996
Just a second. Keep in mind
that her last three boyfriends

34:05.996 --> 34:08.599
all died
under bizarre circumstances.

34:08.599 --> 34:11.001
What? What? Yes, ask about Jud.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.525
What happened to Jud?

34:16.927 --> 34:19.089
Well...

34:19.089 --> 34:23.132
Well, you can lose perspective,
looking through a camera

34:23.132 --> 34:26.056
and he didn't really notice

34:26.056 --> 34:29.820
that he'd actually stepped
into the alligator pit.

34:29.820 --> 34:32.342
Alligator pit? How about Michael?

34:32.342 --> 34:35.264
And Michael?
Now, that wasn't my fault.

34:36.466 --> 34:38.629
Not really.

34:38.629 --> 34:41.150
I didn't tell him
to go to the Dodgers game.

34:41.150 --> 34:45.034
Who knew he was gonna try and catch
a foul ball from the second deck?

34:45.034 --> 34:47.958
(WHISTLES) Let's not forget erm...
(BEEPING)

34:47.958 --> 34:50.080
Well, let's not forget...

34:50.080 --> 34:52.282
Would you stop it?

34:52.282 --> 34:54.685
If you don't wanna be with me,
just say it.

34:54.685 --> 34:56.726
Oh, say it, Sam. Say it.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.250
Lorraine...

35:01.492 --> 35:03.614
..I don't wanna be with you any more.

35:03.614 --> 35:05.816
You said it.

35:05.816 --> 35:08.218
I can't believe
you actually said it.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.182
That's just fine. That's...

35:12.182 --> 35:15.666
Lorraine - Now I can get on
with my life without you.

35:15.666 --> 35:18.108
It's fine. It's good. (MUTTERS)

35:33.243 --> 35:35.205
It's for the best, Sam.

35:35.205 --> 35:37.047
You did the right thing.

35:39.490 --> 35:41.211
I know.

35:45.015 --> 35:47.257
Uh-oh, Sam. No!

35:50.741 --> 35:52.783
Stop!

35:57.307 --> 35:59.750
(BEEPING)
Damn it, she still gets killed.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.113
A witness says
that she was run off the road

36:03.113 --> 36:04.915
by a guy driving a Camper.

36:04.915 --> 36:05.916
Damn it. He never gets caught.

36:13.224 --> 36:15.826
(BEEPING)
You gotta get there before he does.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.803
Go! Go!

36:32.803 --> 36:35.606
Stop! No! No!

36:39.610 --> 36:41.732
Come on!

36:41.732 --> 36:43.774
Pull it!

36:48.019 --> 36:50.021
(HORN HONKS)

36:55.466 --> 36:57.188
Wake up, Lorraine.

36:57.188 --> 36:59.230
He's not worth dying over.

37:17.488 --> 37:19.610
(HORN HONKS)

37:19.610 --> 37:21.292
No.

38:10.861 --> 38:12.503
Come on.

(FLAMES CRACKLE)

39:13.844 --> 39:16.007
Well, that's the end of Nicky.

39:16.007 --> 39:18.209
Joey doesn't die, right?

39:18.209 --> 39:21.052
No, Joey doesn't die
and the truck driver's fine.

39:21.052 --> 39:23.494
Ziggy said he was belted in.
Uh-oh. What?

39:23.494 --> 39:25.536
Lorraine still dies.

39:30.021 --> 39:34.625
God! Those people got burned
to death and Joey got shot.

39:34.625 --> 39:37.989
At the gas station?
No, after the explosion.

39:37.989 --> 39:40.872
He's OK though.
So you both got away safe?

39:40.872 --> 39:43.794
This guy, he kept -
The guy in the Camper? Yeah.

39:43.794 --> 39:45.917
Did Joey know who it was?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.199
Some guy named Nicky.

39:48.199 --> 39:50.882
He was the one
that killed Joey's friend Ponti.

39:50.882 --> 39:53.804
That's why Joey left Chicago -
he saw the murder.

39:53.804 --> 39:56.968
So where's this Nicky now?
I don't know, we lost him.

39:56.968 --> 39:59.010
He never caught Joey? No.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.852
I don't think so.

40:01.852 --> 40:03.854
I don't know.

40:03.854 --> 40:05.736
We had this horrible fight
and I left.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.458
Joey didn't come with you?

40:07.458 --> 40:11.422
OK, OK, OK. There's a fork
in the road, up ahead.

40:11.422 --> 40:13.704
When we get to it, you're gonna...
(BLEEPING)

40:13.704 --> 40:15.987
What do you mean,
you don't know which way we go?

40:15.987 --> 40:17.949
You haven't told me yet.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.071
No, I'm talking to Gushie.

40:20.071 --> 40:21.752
Gushie, centre me on her.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.434
(BEEPING)

40:23.434 --> 40:26.277
Al, just tell me which way
to the airport, OK?

40:26.277 --> 40:28.039
We don't know.

40:28.039 --> 40:29.240
According to Ziggy, her body was
found in the desert...
..midway between Taos and...

40:34.746 --> 40:38.070
How? Who killed her?
We don't know that either.

40:38.070 --> 40:41.593
This is crazy, Al. Nicky's dead,
right? He's a French fry.

40:41.593 --> 40:44.716
Yeah, right, well, if he's dead,
then, who kills Lorraine?

40:44.716 --> 40:46.758
I told you, Ziggy's got nothing.

40:49.721 --> 40:51.883
Maybe it was another accident.

40:52.538 --> 40:55.381
I mean, she is accident prone.
Oh, sure (!)

40:55.381 --> 40:58.985
She accidentally shot a 2" hole
in the back of her head

40:58.985 --> 41:01.788
and then dumped herself out
in the wilderness (!)

41:01.788 --> 41:04.591
Why doesn't Ziggy centre in on her?
What's the problem?

41:04.591 --> 41:08.354
He can't. She's one of those people
that's got little synapses -

41:08.354 --> 41:11.678
Connections? Connections
in her brain missing, yes.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.560
She's dizzy
and hard to get a lock on.

41:14.721 --> 41:16.843
Well, he's got to.

41:16.843 --> 41:19.005
How much time is left?

41:19.005 --> 41:22.208
According to the autopsy report,
she's...

41:22.208 --> 41:25.451
We've got about seven minutes,
almost eight minutes.

41:27.213 --> 41:29.375
Oh, there's the fork, right there.

41:29.375 --> 41:33.539
Now, 62% chance that whoever
killed her met her in Taos,

41:33.539 --> 41:35.662
so take a left.

41:35.662 --> 41:37.503
Yeah.

41:37.503 --> 41:40.266
No, take a...a left, Sam.
Take a left.

41:40.266 --> 41:43.710
That's not a left, that's a right.
What are you doing?

41:43.710 --> 41:46.913
I'm following my gut.
I hope you got good guts.

41:48.995 --> 41:51.037
So do I.

41:53.159 --> 41:56.723
Where did you leave Joey, Lorraine?
At the gas station.

41:56.723 --> 41:59.245
Did he say where he was going?
No.

41:59.245 --> 42:01.447
Where could he have gone?

42:01.447 --> 42:04.530
I don't know and I don't care.
I'm with you now.

42:04.530 --> 42:06.332
Damn it, Lorraine, think!

42:06.332 --> 42:08.134
Where could he have gone?

42:08.134 --> 42:11.377
Carl, why are you acting like this?
I don't understand.

42:11.377 --> 42:13.299
I do.
(GUN CLICKS)

42:13.299 --> 42:16.502
Joey, what are you doing?
Saving your life.

42:16.502 --> 42:19.545
Something I should have done
three years ago. What?

42:19.545 --> 42:21.588
Joey, Joey, Joey.

42:22.709 --> 42:24.951
How are you doing?

42:24.951 --> 42:26.953
You know each other?
You could say that.

42:26.953 --> 42:29.075
Nicky and I go way back. Nicky?

42:29.075 --> 42:31.077
Nicky Bellini.

42:31.077 --> 42:32.919
He's been using you, Lorraine.

42:32.919 --> 42:34.761
Using you to find me.

42:34.761 --> 42:37.123
No, you're wrong.

42:37.123 --> 42:40.086
We're engaged to be married.
Tell him, Carl.

42:41.648 --> 42:43.770
Oh, God!
(BEEPING)

42:43.770 --> 42:46.853
Sam, he's got a gun.
Put your hands on your head.

42:46.853 --> 42:48.935
Come on.

42:55.101 --> 42:57.223
You were using me?

42:57.223 --> 42:59.706
You were using me to find him?

42:59.706 --> 43:04.791
Hey, you used me to find Joey too,
Lorraine, or at least my money.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.953
I'm just sorry it took so long.

43:06.953 --> 43:09.515
And, everything you said,
you didn't mean any of it?

43:09.515 --> 43:11.357
Looks like you didn't, neither.

43:11.357 --> 43:13.760
You'd have let me just die
in that explosion!

43:13.760 --> 43:16.522
Face it, Lorraine,
nobody wants a jinx.

43:16.522 --> 43:19.125
You bastard. 
No, no, no, no!

43:19.125 --> 43:21.247
Go ahead and I'll break it.

43:21.247 --> 43:23.369
(WHIMPERS)

43:23.369 --> 43:25.531
You should have shot him.

43:25.531 --> 43:27.654
Let her go.

43:27.654 --> 43:29.776
Put the rifle down first.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.818
He's gonna break her neck.

43:35.622 --> 43:37.744
OK.

43:37.744 --> 43:39.906
OK, just don't hurt her, all right.

43:39.906 --> 43:41.948
Now my gun.

43:48.154 --> 43:50.196
Back off!

43:52.358 --> 43:54.400
OK, get ready to take off.

44:00.687 --> 44:02.408
Go, now!

44:02.408 --> 44:04.450

So you've known the deceased
for some time? Yeah.

44:29.956 --> 44:32.438
I'd like to say you did it, Sam,

44:32.438 --> 44:35.602
but I think, this one,
we gotta give it all to Lorraine.

44:35.602 --> 44:37.724
What happens to her?

44:37.724 --> 44:39.405
She marries Joey.

44:39.405 --> 44:42.849
And he's still alive? 
No. Yes.

44:42.849 --> 44:44.971
Poor Carl - I mean Nicky.

44:44.971 --> 44:48.214
I always thought
he'd die in a plane crash.

44:51.738 --> 44:53.780
So what happens to us?

44:55.782 --> 44:58.625
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

44:58.625 --> 45:01.307
You get your lounge act
back together.

45:01.307 --> 45:03.910
As a matter of fact,
you're still performing nightly

45:03.910 --> 45:06.352
at the Freaky Kiki in Waikiki.

45:06.352 --> 45:07.553
We go to Hawaii?

45:07.553 --> 45:09.596
I would love to.

45:11.998 --> 45:13.359
(GRUNTS)

45:13.359 --> 45:15.481
Sorry. It's OK.

45:15.481 --> 45:17.644
It's OK.

45:17.644 --> 45:19.686
(CHUCKLES)

45:31.666 --> 45:33.868
Well, are you gonna blow,

45:33.868 --> 45:36.471
or wait till
the whole house burns down?

45:38.473 --> 45:40.154
Blow?

45:40.355 --> 45:40.515
Yeah, the candles.

45:40.515 --> 45:42.156
Yeah.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.122
Surprise!

45:48.122 --> 45:50.244
(WHOOPS OF DELIGHT)

45:50.244 --> 45:52.367
Happy birthday!

45:52.367 --> 45:54.529
Yeah! Come here!

45:54.529 --> 45:57.051
(EXCITED CHATTER)

46:00.932 --> 46:05.537
We don't wanna wear him out before
I can give him my gift, do we?

46:06.738 --> 46:08.860
(LAUGHTER)
Happy birthday.

46:08.860 --> 46:10.902
Yeah!
 Oh-oh... Oh, boy!
