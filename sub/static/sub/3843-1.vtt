<i>~ Raindrops on roses ~</i>

00:22.491 --> 00:25.310
<i>~ And whiskers on kittens ~</i>

00:26.336 --> 00:28.341
<i>~ Bright copper kettles ~</i>

00:28.418 --> 00:31.725

00:32.761 --> 00:34.487

<i>~ These are a few ~</i>

00:40.375 --> 00:46.043
<i>~ Of my favorite things ~</i>

00:48.413 --> 00:51.711
We were somewhere around
Barstow, on the edge of the desert...

00:51.768 --> 00:54.108
when the drugs
began to take hold.

01:05.847 --> 01:08.666
I remember saying something like:

01:08.734 --> 01:12.022
I feel a bit lightheaded.
Maybe you should drive.

01:14.649 --> 01:17.948
- Hmm ?
- Suddenly there was
a terrible roar all around us...

01:18.006 --> 01:20.825
and the sky was full of
what looked like huge bats...

01:20.893 --> 01:23.703
- all swooping and screeching
and diving around the car.

01:23.770 --> 01:26.637
- And a voice was screaming:
- Holy Jesus, what are
these goddamned animals ?

01:26.714 --> 01:30.511
<i>~ Come on, baby ~</i>

01:30.588 --> 01:32.918
- Did you say something ?
- Hmm ?

01:32.985 --> 01:34.836
Never mind.

01:34.903 --> 01:36.754
It's your turn to drive.

01:36.821 --> 01:39.641
No point in mentioning
these bats, I thought.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.451
The poor bastard'll
see them soon enough.

01:42.518 --> 01:44.378
<i>~ Baby, I'm startin'
to feel human ~</i>

01:44.436 --> 01:46.891
<i>- ~ Ohh, ohh, yeah ~
- ~ Hey, hey, Feel with me, baby ~</i>

01:46.968 --> 01:49.720
<i>~ 'Cause I feel it comin' on ~</i>

01:52.184 --> 01:54.735
Fucking pigs ! Flying !

01:57.689 --> 01:59.598
We had two bags of grass...

01:59.674 --> 02:01.525
75 pellets of mescaline...

02:01.592 --> 02:04.488
five sheets of
high-powered blotter acid...

02:04.565 --> 02:06.953
a salt shaker
half-full of cocaine...

02:07.030 --> 02:10.098
a whole galaxy of multicolored
uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.

02:10.164 --> 02:13.944
Also a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum, a case of beer...

02:14.011 --> 02:15.861
- a pint of raw ether...
- Shit !

02:15.929 --> 02:17.780
two dozen amyls.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.948
Not that we needed all that
for the trip...

02:20.024 --> 02:22.834
but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection...

02:22.901 --> 02:25.289
the tendency is to push it
as far as you can.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.432
The only thing that really
worried me was the ether.

02:29.489 --> 02:32.624
There is nothing in the world
more helpless and irresponsible
and depraved...

02:32.691 --> 02:35.511
than a man in the depths
of an ether binge...

02:35.569 --> 02:38.388
and I knew we'd get into
that rotten stuff pretty soon.

02:40.690 --> 02:41.582
A House subcommittee report
says illegal drugs killed...

02:41.649 --> 02:44.402
160 American G.I.s
last year...

02:44.469 --> 02:46.579
40 of them in Vietnam.

02:47.509 --> 02:48.716
<i>- ~ One toke over the line
Sweet Jesus ~</i>

02:48.783 --> 02:50.644
One toke, man !

02:50.711 --> 02:53.742
<i>[ Singing Along With Radio,
Slightly Behind ]
~ One toke over the line ~</i>

02:53.809 --> 02:56.878
<i>~ Sittin' downtown
at a railway station ~</i>

02:56.945 --> 02:59.601
<i>~ One toke over the line ~</i>

02:59.668 --> 03:02.123
<i>- One toke, you poor fool ?
- ~ Sweet, sweet Mary ~</i>

03:02.200 --> 03:04.876
Wait'll you see
those goddamned bats, man.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.833
<i>~ Mine ~</i>

03:06.900 --> 03:09.449
<i>~ One toke over the line ~</i>

03:11.119 --> 03:14.571
- Let's give that boy a lift.
- What ? No !

03:14.638 --> 03:16.498
Wait !

03:16.566 --> 03:19.184
We can't stop here.
This is bat country.

03:22.512 --> 03:26.290
Hot damn ! I never rode
in a convertible before !

03:26.357 --> 03:29.674
Is that right ? Well, I guess
you're about ready then, aren't ya ?

03:29.742 --> 03:33.041
We're your friends. We're not
like the others, man. Really.

03:33.108 --> 03:35.956
No more of that talk, or I'll
put the leeches on you. Understand ?

03:38.575 --> 03:40.109
Get in.

03:43.533 --> 03:46.736
How long could we maintain,
I wondered.

03:46.803 --> 03:50.246
How long before one of us starts raving
and jabbering at this boy ?

03:50.322 --> 03:52.173
What will he think then ?

03:52.240 --> 03:56.229
This same lonely desert was the last
known home of the Manson family.

03:56.306 --> 03:59.567
Would he make that grim connection
when my attorney starts screaming...

03:59.634 --> 04:02.444
about bats and huge manta rays
coming down on the car ?

04:02.511 --> 04:06.155
If so, well, we'll just have to
cut his head off and bury him somewhere.

04:06.222 --> 04:09.521
- 'Cause it goes without saying
that we can't turn him loose.

04:09.588 --> 04:12.877
He'd report us at once to some kind of
outback nazi law enforcement agency...

04:12.944 --> 04:15.275
and they'll run us down
like dogs.

04:15.342 --> 04:19.120
- Jesus, did I say that,
or just think it ?
- Jesus, did I say that ?

04:19.188 --> 04:21.519
Was I talking ?
Did they hear me ?

04:21.586 --> 04:24.751
It's okay. Just admiring
the shape of your skull.

04:24.818 --> 04:27.628
- No, thanks !
- Maybe I'd better have
a chat with this boy.

04:27.694 --> 04:30.513
- I have asthma !
- Perhaps if I explain things,
he'll rest easy.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.431
All right, listen.

04:32.498 --> 04:36.037
There's one thing you should probably
understand-- Can you hear me ?

04:36.114 --> 04:37.898
Good.

04:37.965 --> 04:40.785
I want you to have
all the background.

04:40.842 --> 04:43.182
- Aah !
- This is a very ominous assignment...

04:43.249 --> 04:45.100
with overtones of
extreme personal danger.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.785
I'm a Doctor of Journalism.
This is important, goddamn it !

04:47.852 --> 04:50.086
This is a fucking true story !

04:50.153 --> 04:52.196
You fucking--

04:52.273 --> 04:54.757
Get your hands off my fucking head !

04:54.834 --> 04:58.622
- Now, now, now.
- Our vibrations were
getting nasty. But why ?

04:58.698 --> 05:01.039
Was there no communication
in this car ?

05:01.106 --> 05:03.915
- Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts ?

05:03.982 --> 05:06.313
This man at the wheel
is my attorney.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.678
He's not just some dingbat I found on
the Strip, man. He's a foreigner.

05:09.736 --> 05:13.217
I think he's probably Samoan.
It doesn't matter, though, does it ?

05:13.294 --> 05:15.624
- Are you prejudiced ?
Hell, no.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.542
I didn't think so.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.908
Because, in spite of his race,
the man is extremely valuable to me.

05:20.975 --> 05:24.265
- Oh, shit. I forgot about the beer.
You want some ?
- No.

05:24.332 --> 05:26.404
- How 'bout some ether ?
- What ?

05:28.494 --> 05:29.290
Never mind. All right, let's get right
to the heart of this thing.

05:29.357 --> 05:30.498
- Twenty-four hours ago
we were sitting...
- ...in the Pogo Lounge...

05:32.224 --> 05:36.156
of the Beverly Heights Hotel,
in the patio section, of course...

05:36.223 --> 05:39.542
drinking Singapore Slings
with mescal on the side...

05:39.618 --> 05:45.287
hiding from the brutish realities
of this foul year of our Lord, 1971.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.163
Cops were goin' apeshit--

05:48.230 --> 05:53.054
Perhaps this is the call you've
been waiting for all this time, sir.

05:53.121 --> 05:54.982
Perhaps.

05:55.039 --> 05:57.561
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:57.637 --> 05:59.489
Mmm ! Really. All right.

05:59.556 --> 06:01.944
Yeah ? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

06:02.021 --> 06:03.392
Okay. Bye.

06:03.459 --> 06:05.560
- That was headquarters.
They want me to--
- Ahem.

06:10.114 --> 06:11.965
Thank you.

06:13.154 --> 06:15.974
They want me to go
to Las Vegas at once...

06:16.031 --> 06:18.851
make contact with a Portuguese
photographer named Lacerda.

06:18.918 --> 06:20.768
He'll have
all the details.

06:20.836 --> 06:24.125
All I have to do is check into my
soundproof suite. He'll seek me out.

06:24.192 --> 06:26.811
- What do you think ?
- Sounds like real trouble.

06:26.878 --> 06:29.696
You're gonna need plenty of legal
advice before this thing is over.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.614
Oh, yeah.

06:31.681 --> 06:34.712
As your attorney, I advise you to rent
a fast car with no top.

06:34.788 --> 06:36.640
And you'll need
the cocaine.

06:36.707 --> 06:39.968
Tape recorder
for special music.

06:40.035 --> 06:41.885
Acapulco shirts.

06:41.952 --> 06:45.463
Get the hell out of L.A.
for at least 48 hours.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.389
- Blows my weekend.
- Why ?

06:47.457 --> 06:51.235
'Cause, naturally, I'm
gonna have to go with you.

06:51.293 --> 06:54.227
We're gonna have to
arm ourselves to the teeth.

06:54.304 --> 06:56.635
Well, why not ?

06:56.702 --> 07:00.279
I mean, if a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right.

07:01.506 --> 07:03.923
This is the American Dream
in action.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.455
Wait !

07:08.219 --> 07:12.535
Shit, we'd be fools not to
ride this strange torpedo
all the way out to the end.

07:12.612 --> 07:14.462
Indeed.
We must do it.

07:14.529 --> 07:16.438
What kind of story
is this ?

07:16.515 --> 07:18.365
It's the Mint 400...

07:18.432 --> 07:22.259
the richest off-road race for
motorcycles and dune buggies in
the history of organized sport.

07:22.335 --> 07:24.187
It's a fantastic
spectacle...

07:24.254 --> 07:26.105
in honor of some
fatback grosero...

07:26.172 --> 07:28.990
who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel
in downtown Las Vegas.

07:29.057 --> 07:31.321
At least that's what
the press release says.

07:31.388 --> 07:33.728
As your attorney,
I advise you to buy a motorcycle.

07:33.786 --> 07:37.085
How else can you cover
a thing like this righteously ?

07:37.152 --> 07:40.442
Well, we're gonna have to
drum it up on our own.

07:40.509 --> 07:42.369
Pure Gonzo journalism.

07:44.354 --> 07:46.809
Shit !

07:51.901 --> 07:55.200
Getting hold of the drugs
and shirts had been no problem...

07:55.257 --> 07:58.077
but the car and tape recorder were
not easy things to round up at 6:30...

07:58.144 --> 08:00.475
on a Friday afternoon
in Hollywood.

08:00.542 --> 08:03.323
Sounds beautiful.
Great. Hang on to it.

08:03.391 --> 08:06.200
Fuckin' A, the gentleman has
a major credit card !

08:06.267 --> 08:09.364
That's right, man. Don't take any guff
from these fucking swine.

08:09.431 --> 08:11.292
I just got through
saying that.

08:11.359 --> 08:15.444
Do you realize who the fuck
you're talking to ? Do you ?

08:15.511 --> 08:17.372
Be over in 30 minutes.

08:20.154 --> 08:22.387
We're gonna need a sound store.

08:22.455 --> 08:25.274
We won't make the nut
unless we have unlimited credit.
- We will, man.

08:25.341 --> 08:27.642
You Samoans
are all the same.

08:27.710 --> 08:32.466
You have no faith in the essential
decency of the white man's culture.

08:32.543 --> 08:34.394
The store was closed...

08:34.461 --> 08:37.270
but the salesman said
he could wait if we'd hurry.

08:39.256 --> 08:42.421
But we were delayed en route
when the Stingray in front of us
killed a pedestrian.

08:43.611 --> 08:46.428
We had trouble again
with the car rental agency.

08:46.486 --> 08:49.785
Mr. Duke, we're all settled.
If I could get your John
Hancock, you're on your way.

08:49.852 --> 08:53.459
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be real careful
with this car, right ?

08:53.526 --> 08:55.386
Oh, yeah, man.
Of course.

09:01.112 --> 09:03.932
Holy smokes !

09:03.989 --> 09:07.767
You just backed over
a 2-foot concrete abutment,
you didn't even slow down.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.797
What, were you going about,
uh, oh, I don't know,
45 miles an hour backwards ?

09:10.874 --> 09:12.724
- There's no harm done.
- Oh ?

09:12.791 --> 09:15.611
I always test the transmission that way,
the rear end for stress factors.

09:15.669 --> 09:18.488
- Boy, this is really a nice pen, man.
- Hey, uh, listen, you--

09:18.556 --> 09:21.366
you fellas haven't been,
uh, drinking, have you ?

09:21.433 --> 09:23.283
- No. Not me.
- Oh. Well--

09:23.350 --> 09:26.169
We're responsible people.

09:26.227 --> 09:28.088
Damn it,
you've got my pen !

09:29.430 --> 09:31.291
Goddamn hippies !

09:33.880 --> 09:37.774
We spent the rest of that night rounding
up materials and packing the car.

09:37.851 --> 09:40.661
Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.

09:42.713 --> 09:44.564
Our trip was different.

09:44.631 --> 09:46.480
It was to be
a classic affirmation...

09:46.548 --> 09:49.367
of everything right and true
in the national character...

09:49.434 --> 09:52.465
a gross physical salute
to the fantastic possibilities
of life in this country.

09:52.532 --> 09:54.393
But only for those
with true grit.

09:54.451 --> 09:56.723
And we are chock full
of that, man.

09:57.558 --> 09:59.121
Damn right !

09:59.188 --> 10:02.640
My attorney understands this concept,
despite his racial handicap.

10:02.708 --> 10:05.048
But do you ?

10:05.115 --> 10:09.199
He said he understood, but I could
see in his eyes that he didn't.

10:09.266 --> 10:12.115
He was lying to me.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.702
Ohh ! Aaah !

10:20.947 --> 10:23.728
Aaah ! Aaah !

10:23.795 --> 10:25.655
Ohhhhh !
Medicine !

10:25.713 --> 10:27.573
- What ?
- Medicine !

10:27.640 --> 10:30.220
Medicine ? Oh, yeah, medicine !
Right. Right here.

10:30.287 --> 10:33.107
Don't worry. This man has a bad heart.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.025
Angina pectoris.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.903
But we have a cure for it.
Here you go. All right.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.789
Big whiff. Big whiff.
Big whiff, sonny boy.

10:40.856 --> 10:43.666
Ah. There you go. Much better.

10:43.733 --> 10:46.187
Now for the doctor.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.180
What the--

11:00.247 --> 11:03.594
What the fuck are we doing out here
in the middle of the desert ?

11:03.670 --> 11:06.345
Somebody call the police.
We need help.

11:06.422 --> 11:09.318
- We need help.
We need help. We need help.

11:17.652 --> 11:19.503
The truth.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.323
Truth ?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.557
We're goin' to Vegas...

11:24.624 --> 11:29.064
to croak a scag baron
named Savage Henry.

11:29.141 --> 11:32.104
- It's true.
- Why ? Because I've
known him for years...

11:32.181 --> 11:34.032
but he ripped us off.

11:34.099 --> 11:36.468
And you know what that means.
- And you know what that means.

11:36.525 --> 11:38.347
- Right ?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

11:38.414 --> 11:40.275
Savage Henry...

11:40.333 --> 11:42.193
has cashed
his check.

11:42.261 --> 11:45.069
- Cashed his check.
- And we're gonna rip his lungs out.

11:45.136 --> 11:48.301
- And eat them. That bastard
won't get away with this.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.484
-Goddamn it. What day is it ? Saturday ?
-Shit.

23:55.541 --> 23:57.402
- More like Sunday.
- Ahh.

24:01.659 --> 24:03.510
Hello ! Anyone ?

24:03.577 --> 24:05.428
Have you seen the race ?

24:05.495 --> 24:09.273
By 10:00 they were spread out
all over the course.

24:09.341 --> 24:11.508
- Ohh !
- It was no longer a race.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.549
Now it was
an endurance contest.

24:14.616 --> 24:18.931
The idea of trying to cover
this race in any conventional
press sense was absurd.

24:18.998 --> 24:21.299
- Hey ! It's pretty great, huh ?
- What ?

24:21.366 --> 24:23.371
Come on in !

24:27.802 --> 24:31.379
I'm just gonna try different
combinations of lenses and film...

24:31.446 --> 24:34.678
until I find something
that works in this dust !

24:36.662 --> 24:39.051
What the hell ?

24:39.127 --> 24:42.512
That's fucking machine guns.
They're firing at us. Machine guns !

24:42.579 --> 24:45.581
- It's a goddamn war zone !
Get us out of here quick !

24:45.658 --> 24:49.168
Yeee-hoo !
- Quick, man ! We're gonna
be killed, for fuck's sake !

24:49.235 --> 24:53.743
What the-- Oh, no.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:55.219 --> 24:57.080
Where's
the damn race ?

24:58.106 --> 24:59.956
Beats me, man.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.095
We're just good, patriotic Americans
like yourself.

25:03.283 --> 25:05.806
What outfit
you fellas with ?

25:05.873 --> 25:08.779
Oh. The sporting press.
We're friendlies.

25:08.856 --> 25:10.707
Hired geeks.

25:13.786 --> 25:16.115
Uh...yeah.

25:16.183 --> 25:19.530
- Let's go.
- Yee-ooooh !

25:19.606 --> 25:21.773
Good luck, gentlemen.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.700
- Get him !
- Freaks.

25:23.767 --> 25:26.702
- Take me back to the pits.
- No ! No, no, no. We have to go on.

25:26.769 --> 25:28.745
We need total coverage !

25:28.822 --> 25:32.811
It was time, I felt, for an agonizing
reappraisal of the whole scene.

25:32.888 --> 25:35.305
You're fired.

25:35.382 --> 25:37.136
Awful jackass.

25:38.614 --> 25:40.463
All right.

25:40.530 --> 25:43.053
- Just drive into the dust !
- I never wanna see you again.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.940
Just drive
into the dust !

25:46.007 --> 25:48.817
Huh ? Ohh.

25:51.541 --> 25:54.667
The race was
definitely underway.

25:54.744 --> 25:58.254
I had witnessed the start.
I was sure of that much.

25:58.321 --> 26:00.180
But what now ?

26:00.238 --> 26:02.099
What comes next ?

26:09.138 --> 26:11.958
Put on the radio.
Turn on the tape machine.

26:12.015 --> 26:13.875
Roll every
goddamn window down.

26:13.942 --> 26:16.273
<i>- ~ It's not unusual ~
- Let us taste this cool desert wind.</i>

26:16.340 --> 26:18.191
<i>~ To be loved by anyone ~</i>

26:18.259 --> 26:21.076
Ah, yes. This is what it's all about.

26:21.135 --> 26:22.995
Total control now...

26:23.062 --> 26:26.256
tooling along the main drag
on a Saturday night in Vegas.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.133
Two good old boys
in a fire-apple red convertible...

26:29.200 --> 26:33.065
stoned, ripped, twisted.

26:33.141 --> 26:34.993
Good people.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.639
Hot fuck.
That sounds heavy.

26:37.716 --> 26:40.458
- Twenty-nine cent hot dogs.
- Mmm.

26:40.525 --> 26:42.386
What are we doing here ?

26:42.453 --> 26:45.263
Are we here to entertain
ourselves or do the job ?

26:45.330 --> 26:47.535
Do the job, of course.

26:47.602 --> 26:51.660
Here we go. Crab louie and a quart
of muscatel for $20.

26:51.727 --> 26:56.464
<i>- ~ It's not unusual ~
- As your attorney, I advise you
to drive to the Tropicana.</i>

26:56.531 --> 26:59.341
Guy Lombardo. He's in the Blue Room
with his Royal Canadians.

26:59.408 --> 27:02.218
- Why ?
- Why ? Why what ?

27:02.285 --> 27:06.063
Why should I pay my hard-earned dollars
to watch a fucking corpse ?

27:06.131 --> 27:07.981
I don't know about you...

27:08.048 --> 27:11.175
- but in my line of business
it's important to be hep.

27:11.251 --> 27:12.901
What do you think
you're doing ?

27:12.978 --> 27:15.692
This is not a parking area !
You've got to move your car !

27:15.759 --> 27:18.579
You can't park your car here.
Excuse me. Sir !

27:18.637 --> 27:20.649
- What ?
- You can't park-- Hey !

27:20.716 --> 27:22.280
You can't
park your car here !

27:22.347 --> 27:24.840
Is this not
a reasonable place to park ?

27:24.907 --> 27:28.005
Reasonable ? You're on a sidewalk !
It's a sidewalk !

27:28.081 --> 27:29.933
- This is not a parking area !
- Debbie Reynolds ?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.289
- You can't park on the sidewalk !
- Seems like a hot ticket.

27:33.357 --> 27:36.013
Drove all the way from L.A.
for this show.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.605
We're friends
of Debbie's.

27:40.491 --> 27:42.352
- Okay, bye.
- We'll see you later.

27:42.409 --> 27:45.641
<i>This was Bob Hope's turf.
- ~ Strangers in the night ~</i>

27:45.708 --> 27:47.568
Frank Sinatra's.

27:47.626 --> 27:49.487
<i>- ~ Exchanging glances ~
- Spiro Agnew's.</i>

27:49.554 --> 27:53.773
The place fairly reeked of high-grade
Formica and plastic palm trees.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.101
Clearly a high-class refuge
for big spenders.

27:59.086 --> 28:02.116
- It's started. Is she on stage ?
- She is. Sold out.

28:02.193 --> 28:05.002
Sorry, sir. Full house.
I'm sorry, sir.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.880
We drove all the way
from L.A. for this show.

28:07.947 --> 28:11.246
- There are no seats left at any price.
- Fuck seats !

28:11.303 --> 28:14.602
- We're friends with Debbie.
I used to romp with her.
- Mm-hmm.

28:16.588 --> 28:19.656
- Are you prepared to go to court ?
- Well, that depends.

28:19.723 --> 28:22.543
I wanna talk to you
for a second.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.573
- Your attitude constitutes
a breach of faith.
- Uh, hi.

28:26.599 --> 28:28.459
In Nevada,
that's illegal.

28:29.640 --> 28:33.159
- What's your name ?
- My name ? Tony Pizzacata.

28:33.226 --> 28:35.077
Tony Pizzacata.

28:35.144 --> 28:37.484
What, may I ask, is your name, sir ?

28:37.551 --> 28:39.881
It's on my driver's license.

28:39.948 --> 28:42.758
- I think we might be able
to squeeze you in, sir.
- Ohh !

28:42.826 --> 28:45.711
- Thank you kindly.
- You'll have to stand in the back.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.737
After a lot of bad noise
he let us in for nothing...

28:50.795 --> 28:53.730
provided we would stand
quietly in the back and not smoke.

28:55.724 --> 28:57.585
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:57.642 --> 29:00.461
the Desert Inn is proud to present
the one, the only...

29:00.528 --> 29:03.492
the incomparable
Miss Debbie Reynolds !

29:03.568 --> 29:05.419
<i>~ Ooh, ooh-ooh ~</i>

29:05.486 --> 29:07.817
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen !

29:07.884 --> 29:10.703
It's wonderful to be here
with you fabulous people !

29:10.761 --> 29:14.146
Whoa !
Let's rock and roll !

29:14.223 --> 29:16.074
<i>~ Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band ~</i>

29:16.141 --> 29:18.470
What the hell's going on ?

29:18.538 --> 29:20.878
- Get'em out !
- Come on, get outta here !

29:20.945 --> 29:22.795
- Aah !
- Get'em out.

29:22.863 --> 29:25.989
<i>- ~ Ooooh, ooooh ~
- Out. Get'em out !</i>

29:26.056 --> 29:29.221
<i>~ Ooooh, ahhhh ~</i>

29:33.806 --> 29:37.249
Shit ! We wandered into a fuckin'
time capsule there.

29:37.325 --> 29:39.175
Scumbag !

29:39.242 --> 29:44.095
I'll find where you live and burn
your house down, you piece of shit !

29:44.172 --> 29:46.022
- What happened ?
- Oh.

29:46.089 --> 29:49.542
- Ohh.
- One of these days I'll toss
a fuckin' bomb in that place.

30:01.836 --> 30:04.320
Oh, wait. You see that ?

30:04.397 --> 30:06.247
This is the place, man.

30:06.315 --> 30:08.166
They'll never
fuck with us here.

30:09.671 --> 30:12.491
Where's the ether ?
Mescaline's not working.

30:12.558 --> 30:14.409
Oh.

30:16.394 --> 30:18.398
There we go.
Right.

30:22.982 --> 30:24.843
Yeah. Why not ?

30:26.597 --> 30:28.458
Yeah.

30:28.525 --> 30:30.376
Mm-hmm.

30:32.333 --> 30:35.775
Ahh. Devil ether.

30:35.852 --> 30:39.812
It makes you behave like the village
drunkard in some early Irish novel.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.210
Total loss of all
basic motor skills.

30:42.277 --> 30:45.097
Blurred vision,
no balance, numb tongue.

30:45.164 --> 30:47.100
The mind recoils in horror...

30:47.177 --> 30:49.987
unable to communicate
with the spinal column...

30:50.054 --> 30:53.833
which is interesting because
you can actually watch yourself
behaving in this terrible way...

30:53.900 --> 30:55.751
but you can't control it.

30:59.462 --> 31:02.847
You approach the turnstiles
and know that when you get there...

31:02.914 --> 31:05.734
you have to give the man two dollars
or he won't let you inside...

31:05.801 --> 31:09.627
but when you get there
everything goes wrong.

31:09.704 --> 31:13.895
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
you think, "What's happening here ?"

31:13.962 --> 31:18.469
-You hear yourself mumbling:
-Dogs fucked the Pope. No fault of mine.

31:20.454 --> 31:23.551
Ether is the perfect drug
for Las Vegas.

31:23.619 --> 31:26.918
In this town they love a drunk.
Fresh meat.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.769
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Holy--

31:28.836 --> 31:32.835
So they put us through the turnstiles
and turned us loose inside.

31:32.902 --> 31:35.233
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:35.300 --> 31:37.160
boys and girls...

31:37.218 --> 31:40.516
visitors of all ages...

31:40.583 --> 31:45.628
- the Bazooko Casino Circus
proudly presents...

31:45.705 --> 31:48.898
the Flying Fellinis !

31:50.912 --> 31:53.636
Ooooh-whoop !

32:12.480 --> 32:14.340
Oh, my God !

32:15.875 --> 32:17.724
Whoop !

32:35.717 --> 32:37.336
<i>~ Mm-hmm ~</i>

32:49.152 --> 32:50.676
Whoa !

32:51.807 --> 32:53.333
Excuse me.

32:53.410 --> 32:56.440
Get out of my way, you--

32:59.077 --> 33:02.299
A drug person can learn to cope
with things like seeing
their dead grandmother...

33:02.366 --> 33:05.531
crawling up their leg
with a knife in her teeth...

33:05.598 --> 33:07.871
but nobody should be asked
to handle this trip.

33:07.938 --> 33:10.422
Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep
world would be doing Saturday night...

33:10.499 --> 33:12.599
if the Nazis
had won the War.

33:12.676 --> 33:14.526
This was the Sixth Reich.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.894
Place your bets !
Everyone's a winner !

33:16.962 --> 33:21.363
Step right up and shoot
the pasties off the nipples
of a ten-foot bull dyke...

33:21.440 --> 33:23.224
and win
a cotton candy goat !

33:23.291 --> 33:26.427
[ Hooting, Chittering,
Hissing ]

33:29.468 --> 33:31.328
Step up to this
fantastic machine !

33:31.395 --> 33:34.684
For just 99 cents your likeness
will appear 200 feet tall...

33:34.751 --> 33:37.081
on a screen
over downtown Las Vegas.

33:37.148 --> 33:40.447
For just 99 cents more
you can have a voice message !
Say whatever you want, fella !

33:40.515 --> 33:44.092
Oh, they'll hear you, all right !
You'll be 200 feet tall !

33:45.530 --> 33:47.094
The ether was wearing off.

33:47.170 --> 33:49.021
The acid was long gone.

33:49.088 --> 33:51.572
But the mescaline
was running strong.

33:51.649 --> 33:54.775
Good mescaline
comes on slow.

33:54.842 --> 33:57.182
The first hour's
all waiting...

33:57.249 --> 33:59.867
and then about halfway
through its second hour...

33:59.934 --> 34:02.744
you start cursing the creep who burned
you because nothing's happening.

34:02.811 --> 34:04.125
And then...zang !

34:04.192 --> 34:06.494
I hate to say this--

34:06.561 --> 34:09.371
but this place is getting to me.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.576
I think I'm
getting the fear.

34:11.643 --> 34:14.463
Nonsense. We came here to find
the American Dream.

34:14.521 --> 34:17.790
Now that we're right
in the vortex, you wanna quit ?

34:17.848 --> 34:20.667
You must realize, man,
we've found the main nerve.

34:20.735 --> 34:22.518
That's what
gives me the fear.

34:22.585 --> 34:24.446
Oh, look !

34:24.503 --> 34:27.889
There's, uh, two women
fucking a polar bear.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.295
Don't tell me
those things.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.145
Not n
now, man.

34:33.212 --> 34:37.009
This is my last drink.
How much money can you lend me ?

34:37.085 --> 34:38.639
Not much. Why ?

34:38.715 --> 34:40.567
- I have to go.
- Go ?

34:40.634 --> 34:43.770
- Yeah. Leave the country.
- Oh, no. Calm down.

34:43.837 --> 34:47.222
You'll be straight in a few hours.
Just sit the fuck down.

34:47.289 --> 34:50.109
Don't fuck around, man.
This is serious.

34:50.167 --> 34:52.985
One more hour in this town
I'll kill somebody.

34:53.053 --> 34:56.494
Okay, I'll lend you some money.

34:56.572 --> 34:58.739
Can we make it ?

34:58.806 --> 35:00.916
- I wanna leave fast.
- Okay.

35:00.983 --> 35:04.215
Let's pay this bill,
get up very slowly--

35:04.283 --> 35:06.612
I think it's gonna be
a long walk.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.020
Light, sir ?

35:10.392 --> 35:13.211
Do they pay you to s
screw that bear ?

35:13.278 --> 35:15.954
What ? What ?

35:16.029 --> 35:18.168
- What did he say ?
- He's drunk.

35:18.235 --> 35:20.499
You'd better take care
of your friend.

35:20.566 --> 35:22.906
Madam, sir, baby, child,
whatever, can I pay--

35:22.973 --> 35:24.910
Here, take this.
That should be enough.

35:24.987 --> 35:28.209
Hey, come on.
Let's go downstairs and gamble.

35:30.205 --> 35:32.851
You guys
don't fucking give up.

35:32.918 --> 35:34.961
Where'd he go ?

35:35.038 --> 35:36.561
Where did he go ?

35:39.352 --> 35:42.162
- When is this thing gonna stop ?
- Stop ?

35:42.229 --> 35:45.327
- Stop it !
- It won't stop.
It's never gonna stop, man.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.092
Don't move.
You'll fall down.

35:47.159 --> 35:48.847
Fuck, he's--

35:50.199 --> 35:53.018
Where did he go-- Oh.

35:53.076 --> 35:54.937
Come on. Let go.

35:55.004 --> 35:57.305
Quick, like a bunny.
Hop ! Hop !

35:57.362 --> 35:59.222
- Come on. Hop !
- I can't !

35:59.290 --> 36:02.637
Oh, you sniveling,
chicken shit bastard !

36:05.591 --> 36:07.115
All right.

36:12.438 --> 36:15.258
Come on--
Oh, fuck ! Ohh !

36:15.315 --> 36:17.107

What I should do, goddamn it,
is call the fucking police !

48:29.824 --> 48:32.384
Boy, are you upset.

48:33.506 --> 48:36.057
There'd be no point, man,
calling the cops.

48:36.134 --> 48:37.984
There's no choice.

48:38.051 --> 48:41.830
I wouldn't dare go to sleep
with you wandering around
with a head full of acid...

48:41.888 --> 48:44.640
wanting to slice me up
with that goddamn knife.

48:44.707 --> 48:47.517
Who said anything
about slicing you up, man ?

48:49.829 --> 48:52.829
I just wanted to cut
a little "Z" in your forehead.

48:54.881 --> 48:59.006
Get back in the tub.
Eat some reds and try to calm down.

48:59.073 --> 49:01.892
Smoke some grass.
Shoot some fucking smack.

49:01.949 --> 49:05.248
Shit, man, do whatever
you gotta do, but please...

49:05.315 --> 49:08.662
I need some fucking rest,
man. Please. Please.

49:08.739 --> 49:11.222
Get out of here,
you pig fucker !

49:11.299 --> 49:14.263
Up ! Up !

49:14.339 --> 49:17.149
Well, l, uh--

49:17.217 --> 49:19.068
Yeah.

49:20.190 --> 49:22.712
You need to get to work.

49:22.789 --> 49:24.860
Goddamn, what a bummer.

49:24.927 --> 49:26.788
You scurvy
shyster bastard.

49:26.845 --> 49:29.464
I'm a Doctor of Journalism, man.

49:29.540 --> 49:31.390
Go on.

49:31.457 --> 49:33.462
- Don't let me keep you up.
- Now--

49:33.539 --> 49:36.636
Don't let me keep you up.

49:36.703 --> 49:39.523
Get in there and clean your shorts !

49:39.581 --> 49:42.332
Clean your shorts, goddamn it,
like a big boy !

49:42.399 --> 49:44.251
Pig !

49:47.003 --> 49:49.823
The acid had
shifted gears on him.

49:49.890 --> 49:53.658
The next phase would probably be
one of those hellishly intense
introspective nightmares.

49:53.725 --> 49:55.585
Must get some peace.

49:55.643 --> 49:58.741
Four hours or so of catatonic despair.

49:58.817 --> 50:01.781
- Damn drugs.
- Aaaaah !

50:02.203 --> 50:05.205
Mmm ?

50:07.650 --> 50:11.227
Ignore the nightmare
in the bathroom.

50:11.294 --> 50:14.420
Just another ugly refugee
from the love generation.

50:15.743 --> 50:18.525
My attorney had never been
able to accept the notion...

50:18.592 --> 50:20.922
often espoused
by former drug abusers...

50:20.990 --> 50:24.116
that you can get a lot higher
without drugs than with them.

50:24.193 --> 50:26.043
Neither have l,
for that matter.

50:26.110 --> 50:28.892
<i>~ When the truth is found ~</i>

50:28.959 --> 50:33.178
<i>~ To be lies ~</i>

50:33.245 --> 50:35.796
<i>~ And all the joy ~</i>

50:35.872 --> 50:40.179
<i>~ Within you dies ~</i>

50:40.256 --> 50:42.902
<i>~ Don't you want
somebody to love ~</i>

50:42.969 --> 50:46.383
<i>~ Don't you need
somebody to love ~</i>

50:46.460 --> 50:49.845
<i>~ Wouldn't you love
somebody to love ~</i>

50:49.914 --> 50:54.736
<i>~ You better find
somebody to love ~</i>

50:54.813 --> 50:56.722
<i>~ Love ~</i>

50:58.716 --> 51:02.811
1965.
The great San Francisco acid wave.

51:02.878 --> 51:04.950
<i>~ When the garden flowers ~</i>

51:05.017 --> 51:09.754
I recall one night in a place
called the Matrix. There I was--

51:09.821 --> 51:13.110
Mother of God. There I am.

51:13.177 --> 51:15.038
Holy fuck.

51:15.095 --> 51:19.219
Uh, clearly I was a victim
of the drug explosion...

51:19.286 --> 51:22.873
a natural street freak
just eating whatever came by.

51:22.940 --> 51:27.697
Does anybody want some LSD ?

51:27.774 --> 51:31.187
I got all the makin's...

51:31.254 --> 51:33.844
right here !

51:33.911 --> 51:39.511
All I need is a place to cook.

51:42.456 --> 51:45.870
I decided to eat only
half of the acid at first...

51:45.946 --> 51:49.591
but I spilled the rest on the sleeve
of my red woolen shirt.

51:53.723 --> 51:57.617
What's the trouble ?

51:57.685 --> 52:00.590
Well, all this white stuff...

52:00.667 --> 52:03.630
on my sleeve...

52:04.916 --> 52:08.847
is LSD.

52:23.251 --> 52:24.882
With a bit of luck...

52:26.071 --> 52:27.730
his life
was ruined forever...

52:27.797 --> 52:32.399
always thinking that just behind some
narrow door in all his favorite bars...

52:32.467 --> 52:34.644
men in red woolen shirts...

52:34.711 --> 52:38.490
are getting incredible kicks
from things he'll never know.

52:43.955 --> 52:47.504
Strange memories on
this nervous night in Las Vegas.

52:47.571 --> 52:52.011
Has it been five years ? Six ?

52:52.088 --> 52:57.007
It seems like a lifetime, the kind
of peak that never comes again.

52:57.074 --> 52:59.980
<i>~ Love is but
a song we're singin' ~</i>

53:00.057 --> 53:02.445
San Francisco
in the middle '60s...

53:02.522 --> 53:06.291
was a very special time and place
to be a part of...

53:06.358 --> 53:08.909
<i>- but no explanation...
- ~ We can make the mountains ring ~</i>

53:08.986 --> 53:10.835
no mix of words
or music or memories...

53:10.902 --> 53:14.249
can touch that sense of knowing
that you were there and alive...

53:14.326 --> 53:18.125
in that corner of time in the world,
whatever it meant.

53:18.201 --> 53:21.779
<i>~ Though the bird
is on the wing ~</i>

53:21.846 --> 53:25.289
<i>~ And you may not
know why ~</i>

53:27.120 --> 53:28.981
There was madness
in any direction...

53:29.048 --> 53:31.243
<i>- ~ Come on, people, now ~
- at any hour.</i>

53:31.319 --> 53:33.324
<i>- ~ Smile on your brothers ~
- You could strike sparks anywhere.</i>

53:33.391 --> 53:35.693
<i>~ Everybody get together ~</i>

53:35.760 --> 53:37.774
<i>- ~ Try to love one another ~
- There was a fantastic
universal sense...</i>

53:37.841 --> 53:40.210
that whatever we were doing was right,
that we were winning.

53:41.332 --> 53:43.538
And that, I think,
was the handle.

53:43.605 --> 53:45.360
<i>~ Some may come
and some may go ~</i>

53:45.427 --> 53:47.278
That sense
of inevitable victory...

53:47.345 --> 53:48.842
over the forces
of old and evil.

53:48.918 --> 53:52.015
Not in any mean or military sense--
we didn't need that.

53:53.942 --> 53:56.522
Our energy
would simply prevail.

53:56.599 --> 53:59.697
We had all the momentum.

53:59.764 --> 54:03.111
We were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.

54:04.559 --> 54:09.200
So now, less than five years later...

54:09.267 --> 54:12.710
you can go up a steep hill
in Las Vegas and look west...

54:12.787 --> 54:15.308
and with the right kind
of eyes...

54:15.376 --> 54:18.310
you can almost see
the high-water mark...

54:18.387 --> 54:21.197
that place where the wave
finally broke...

54:21.264 --> 54:23.125
and rolled back.

54:23.183 --> 54:26.961
<i>~ Try to love one another right now ~</i>

54:34.603 --> 54:36.944
<i>~ [ Piano Continues,
Rock Band Begins ]</i>

54:37.011 --> 54:39.341
<i>~ Want some whiskey in your water ~</i>

54:39.409 --> 54:42.439
<i>- Room service !
- ~ Some sugar in your tea ~</i>

54:42.516 --> 54:45.613
<i>~ What's all these crazy questions
they're askin' me ~</i>

54:45.681 --> 54:48.490
<i>- Good morning, sir.
- ~ This is the craziest party
there could ever be ~</i>

54:48.557 --> 54:51.376
What do you want, man ?
What do you want ?

54:51.443 --> 54:53.294
- Room service.
- Get out.

54:53.361 --> 54:56.172
<i>- ~ Mama told me not to come ~
- You're in the wrong room.
Get the fuck out !</i>

54:56.239 --> 54:59.057
<i>- I've got a gun. It's not mine, really.
- ~ Mama told me not to come ~</i>

54:59.115 --> 55:00.976
- Uh, the-- the-- the bill.
- What ?

55:01.043 --> 55:03.853
- Will you...s-sign for it ?
- Yeah, I'll get it. Hurry up.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.251
Don't move, man.
Be very still.

55:06.318 --> 55:08.178
There we go.

55:08.236 --> 55:10.096
Say nothing
to no one, man.

55:10.163 --> 55:13.193
<i>~ Open up the window
Let some air into this room ~</i>

55:13.261 --> 55:17.518
The decision
to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not.

55:17.586 --> 55:21.479
<i>- ~ That cigarette you're smokin'
'bout scared me half to death ~
- Maybe I'd planned it all along,</i>

55:21.546 --> 55:23.819
subconsciously waiting
for the right moment.

55:23.887 --> 55:26.639
<i>- ~ Mama told me not to come ~
- The bill was a factor, I think...</i>

55:26.706 --> 55:29.380
<i>- because I had no money to pay for it.
- ~ Mama told me not to come ~</i>

55:29.457 --> 55:33.227
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between
29 and 36 dollars per hour...

55:33.294 --> 55:36.103
<i>- ~ That ain't the way
to have fun, son ~
- for 48 consecutive hours.</i>

55:36.170 --> 55:38.031
<i>- Incredible.
- ~ That ain't the way to have fun ~</i>

55:38.089 --> 55:39.950
How could it happen ?

55:40.017 --> 55:44.207
But by the time I asked this question,
there was no one around to answer it.

55:44.265 --> 55:47.267
That rotten attorney of mine,
Dr. Gonzo, was gone.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.193
He must have sensed trouble.

55:49.260 --> 55:51.016
Hmm ? Ohh.

55:51.083 --> 55:52.837
A "Z" ?

55:52.904 --> 55:54.880
Panic.

55:55.178 --> 55:59.589
It crept up my spine like
first-rising vibes of an acid frenzy.

55:59.656 --> 56:03.435
- All these horrible realities
began to dawn on me.

56:03.503 --> 56:06.120
Oh, fuck.

56:06.187 --> 56:08.038
Here I was...

56:08.105 --> 56:11.039
alone in Las Vegas,
completely twisted on drugs.

56:11.116 --> 56:14.281
No cash,
no story for the magazine...

56:14.348 --> 56:19.565
and on top of everything else
I had a gigantic goddamn
hotel bill to deal with.

56:21.895 --> 56:24.197
I didn't even know
who'd won the race.

56:24.265 --> 56:26.125
Maybe nobody.

56:26.182 --> 56:29.001
How would Horatio Alger
have handled this situation ?

56:30.124 --> 56:33.287
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

56:33.355 --> 56:35.589
I'm a relatively
respectable citizen.

56:35.657 --> 56:38.563
- Multiple felon, perhaps,
but certainly not dangerous.

56:38.630 --> 56:40.970
Taxi !

56:41.037 --> 56:45.372
Luckily I had taken the soap
and grapefruit and other luggage
out to the car earlier.

56:45.448 --> 56:46.915
Now--

56:46.983 --> 56:48.842
it was only a matter
of slipping the noose.

56:48.900 --> 56:52.544
Hey ! Here, take this.
All right.

56:52.621 --> 56:56.543
- Mr. Duke ! Mr. Duke !
- Oh, shit.

56:56.620 --> 57:00.745
- We've been looking for you.
- The game was up. They had me.

57:00.812 --> 57:03.977
Many fine books have been written
in prison, huh ?

57:04.044 --> 57:06.143
- Sir ?
- What ?

57:06.220 --> 57:08.224
Um, this telegram
came for you.

57:08.301 --> 57:11.168
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.

57:11.235 --> 57:14.467
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke."
Do you-- Do you--

57:14.534 --> 57:17.402
- Does that mean anything ?
- Yes, yes, it means a lot. Thanks.

57:17.479 --> 57:20.778
- Yeah, I checked the register
for this man Thompson.

57:20.835 --> 57:23.290
We don't show him, but I figured
he might be part of your team.

57:23.367 --> 57:25.314
-He is. Don't worry. I'll get it to him.
-Yeah.

57:25.381 --> 57:27.902
Um, what confused us
was, uh...

57:27.979 --> 57:32.227
Dr. Gonzo's signature
on the telegram from Los Angeles
when we knew he was right here.

57:32.295 --> 57:34.338
Right.
You did the right thing.

57:34.405 --> 57:37.608
Never try to understand a press message.
About half the time, we use codes.

57:37.675 --> 57:39.871
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.
See ya.

57:39.938 --> 57:43.649
Um, tell me.

57:43.716 --> 57:46.172
When will the doctor
be awake ?

57:46.248 --> 57:50.074
- Awake ? What do you mean ?
- Well, um...

57:50.150 --> 57:53.661
my manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.

57:53.737 --> 57:56.126
It's nothing unusual, um--

57:56.193 --> 58:00.057
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all of our large accounts...

58:00.134 --> 58:02.302
put'em on a personal basis,
you know ?

58:02.369 --> 58:04.479
Just a chat and a handshake.
You understand.

58:04.546 --> 58:06.406
Of course,
but if I were you...

58:06.473 --> 58:08.774
I would leave the doctor alone
until after he's eaten his breakfast...

58:08.832 --> 58:10.692
because he's
a very crude man.

58:10.759 --> 58:13.119
Jesus God !

58:13.186 --> 58:15.574
No !

58:15.651 --> 58:20.225
But he will be available,
huh, maybe later this morning ?

58:20.292 --> 58:24.157
Look, the telegram
is actually all scrambled.

58:24.224 --> 58:27.072
It's actually from Thompson,
not to him.

58:27.140 --> 58:30.649
All right ? Now, I've got to go.
I've gotta get to the race.

58:30.725 --> 58:33.344
- B-But there's no hurry.
The race is over.
- Not for me.

58:33.411 --> 58:36.441
Well, um--
Let's have lunch !

58:36.518 --> 58:38.906
Righty-o, man.
Righty-o.

58:39.232 --> 58:44.468
<i>- ~ Now, the bricks
lay on Grand Street ~
- Jesus.</i>

58:44.545 --> 58:49.282
Bad waves of paranoia.
Madness. Fear and loathing.

58:49.349 --> 58:52.131
Intolerable vibrations
in this place. Get out.

58:52.198 --> 58:54.048
The weasels were closing in.

58:54.115 --> 58:56.254
I could smell the ugly brutes.

58:56.321 --> 58:58.172
Do me one last favor, Lord.

58:58.239 --> 59:01.653
Just give me five more high-speed hours
before You bring the hammer down.

59:01.731 --> 59:06.679
Just let me get rid of this goddamn car
and off this horrible desert.

59:06.756 --> 59:10.466
<i>~ Oh, Mama ~</i>

59:10.533 --> 59:13.756
<i>~ Is this really the end ~</i>

59:13.823 --> 59:16.374
<i>- ~ To be stuck inside of Mobile ~

<i>- ~ With the Memphis blues again ~
- This is Your work.
You better take care of me, Lord.</i>

59:19.011 --> 59:21.696
- If You don't, You're
gonna have me on Your hands.

59:30.940 --> 59:33.434
- Pull over ! Pull over !
- Hey !

59:33.501 --> 59:34.968
Good morning. How are you ?
All right, man. Doing very well.

59:39.582 --> 59:41.557
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

59:41.633 --> 59:45.979
Your normal speeder will panic
and immediately pull over to the side.

59:46.046 --> 59:48.912
This is wrong.
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

59:50.427 --> 59:53.563
Make the bastard chase you.
He will follow.

59:53.630 --> 59:57.208
But he won't know what to make
of your blinker signal that says
you're about to turn right.

59:57.275 --> 01:00:01.849
This is to let him know you're
pulling off for a proper place to talk.

01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:04.074
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

01:00:04.074 --> 01:00:06.338
It'll take him a moment
to realize he's about to make
a 180-degree turn, at speed.

01:00:06.405 --> 01:00:08.513
But you will be ready.
Brace for the "G"s.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.595
Fast heel-toe work.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.411
Hi. How are you ?

01:00:27.559 --> 01:00:30.340
Just what in the hell
did you think you were doing ?

01:00:30.408 --> 01:00:33.668
I wanna know.
Let me see your license.

01:00:33.735 --> 01:00:36.670
Oh, yeah, of course.
There you are.

01:00:39.653 --> 01:00:41.513
Oh, my gosh.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.033
It's me.

01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:49.952
May I please have that ?

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.018
I knew I was fucked.

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:03.100
See you have two cases of beer,
a basket of grapefruit...

01:01:03.177 --> 01:01:05.440
stack of T-shirts and towels,
light bulbs.

01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:10.685
- You realize what you did
when you drive like that ?
- Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.

01:01:10.752 --> 01:01:14.138
I understand that. I knew it
was a crime. I did it anyway.

01:01:14.214 --> 01:01:17.063
Shit, why argue ?
I'm a fucking criminal. Look at me.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.546
You have
a strange attitude.

01:01:19.623 --> 01:01:21.560
Maybe.

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:25.943
You know, I have a feeling
you need to take a nap.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.225
There's a rest area
just up ahead.

01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:31.390
I'd like you to go up there,
pull over and get a few hours' sleep.

01:01:31.457 --> 01:01:33.404
That's not gonna help me.

01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:36.539
I've been awake for too long.
Three or four nights, maybe.
Can't even remember.

01:01:36.606 --> 01:01:39.225
I go to sleep now,
I'm dead for 20 hours.

01:01:40.673 --> 01:01:43.455
What are you carrying
two cases of soap for, son ?

01:01:43.522 --> 01:01:45.861
I wanna stay clean.

01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:47.779
No.

01:01:49.054 --> 01:01:50.752
Here's how it is.

01:01:50.819 --> 01:01:53.600
What I put in my book,
as of noon...

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:56.793
is that I apprehended you
for driving too fast.

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.996
- I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area.

01:02:00.063 --> 01:02:01.924
Stop !

01:02:04.926 --> 01:02:07.745
I advised you to proceed
to the next rest area--

01:02:07.812 --> 01:02:10.709
your stated destination, right ?

01:02:12.223 --> 01:02:14.717
And take a long nap.

01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:18.208
Do I make myself clear ?

01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:21.143
Well...
how far is Baker ?

01:02:21.219 --> 01:02:24.480
I was sort of hoping to,
I don't know, stop there for lunch.

01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:27.740
It's not my jurisdiction.

01:02:27.807 --> 01:02:31.192
City limits end 2.2 miles
beyond the rest area.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.148
Can you make it that far ?

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:35.287
I'll try.

01:02:35.364 --> 01:02:39.449
I've been wanting to go to Baker for
a long time. Yeah. Heard a lot about it.

01:02:41.214 --> 01:02:43.074
Excellent seafood.

01:02:44.801 --> 01:02:47.927
You know, I'm thinkin',
a guy with your kind of mind...

01:02:48.003 --> 01:02:50.745
ought to try
the land-crab.

01:02:50.814 --> 01:02:54.073
- Excellent seafood.
- Land-crab.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.334
All right. Why not ?

01:02:57.401 --> 01:02:59.607
Thanks for the tip.

01:02:59.674 --> 01:03:01.689
Look at me in the eyes.

01:03:04.863 --> 01:03:06.713
Everything all right ?

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:13.464
May I have a little kiss
before you go ?

01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:16.984
I'm very lonely here.

01:03:17.233 --> 01:03:20.369
<i>~ Oh, Mama ~</i>

01:03:20.436 --> 01:03:23.122
<i>~ Can this really
be the end ~</i>

01:03:23.189 --> 01:03:26.899
I felt raped.
The pig had done me on all fronts.

01:03:26.967 --> 01:03:30.026
And now he was going off to chuckle
about it on the west side of town...

01:03:30.103 --> 01:03:32.462
waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

01:03:32.529 --> 01:03:36.557
Why, yes, Officer. Of course
I'll take advantage of that rest area.

01:03:36.624 --> 01:03:41.064
And I can't tell you how grateful
I am for this break you wanna give me.

01:03:41.141 --> 01:03:43.951
Get a grip, man.

01:03:44.018 --> 01:03:47.431
If I boom straight for L.A.,
he'll bust me for sure.

01:03:47.508 --> 01:03:50.951
No. This was not the time
for a showdown.

01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:55.114
This was Death Valley.

01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:59.889
Oh, fuck !

01:03:59.957 --> 01:04:02.259
Sweet Jesus, it's him.

01:04:02.326 --> 01:04:04.655
Oh, my God !

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:13.037
Shit !
Come on, you fucking bastard.

01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:16.202
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I've got to go. I've got to--

01:04:18.734 --> 01:04:20.910
Well, they've nailed me,
goddamn it.

01:04:20.977 --> 01:04:23.308
I'm trapped in some stinking
desert crossroads called Baker.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:26.031
I don't have much time, man.
The fuckers are closing in.

01:04:26.098 --> 01:04:29.158
- They'll hunt me down
like a fucking beast.
You sound paranoid.

01:04:29.234 --> 01:04:31.238
I need a fucking lawyer
immediately !

01:04:31.315 --> 01:04:33.962
What are you doing in Baker ?
Didn't you get my telegram ?

01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:38.344
What telegram, you worthless bastard ?
I'll cripple your ass for this.

01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:41.481
You brainless scumbag,
you're supposed to be in Vegas.

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:43.629
I rented a suite
at the Flamingo.

01:04:43.696 --> 01:04:47.886
You're supposed to be covering the
National District Attorney's conference.

01:04:47.953 --> 01:04:51.943
- I made all the reservations.
Everything is arranged.

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:55.309
Now, what the fuck are you doing out
there in the middle of the desert ?

01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:58.502
Nothing. Never mind.
It's all a big joke.

01:04:58.579 --> 01:05:01.926
I'm actually, uh-- I'm poolside
at the Flamingo right now...

01:05:02.003 --> 01:05:04.812
talking through a portable phone some
dwarf brought out from the casino.

01:05:04.879 --> 01:05:08.006
Yeah, I have total credit here.
Don't come anywhere
near this place, you bastard.

01:05:08.082 --> 01:05:09.934
Foreigners
aren't welcome here.

01:05:12.177 --> 01:05:15.717
Well, this is how
the world works.

01:05:15.794 --> 01:05:19.946
All energy flows according
to the whims of the Great Magnet.

01:05:20.013 --> 01:05:22.603
What a fool I was
to defy him.

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.737
I was going back to Vegas.
I had no choice.

01:05:28.844 --> 01:05:30.849
I had to get rid
of the Shark.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:35.011
Too many people might recognize it,
especially the Vegas police.

01:05:36.297 --> 01:05:39.941
Luckily, my credit card
was still technically valid.

01:05:40.008 --> 01:05:43.116
Now this
was a superior machine.

01:05:43.183 --> 01:05:46.951
Ten grand worth of gimmicks
and high-priced special effects.

01:05:47.018 --> 01:05:50.317
The rear windows leapt up with a touch
like frogs in a dynamite pond.

01:05:50.384 --> 01:05:53.673
The dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters...

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.042
that I would never understand.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:58.660
If the pigs
were gathering in Vegas...

01:05:58.727 --> 01:06:02.180
I felt the drug culture
should be represented as well.

01:06:02.247 --> 01:06:05.094
And there was a certain bent appeal in
the notion of running a savage burn...

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:07.022
on one Las Vegas hotel...

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.216
and then just wheeling across town
and checking into another.

01:06:10.283 --> 01:06:13.410
Me and a thousand ranking cops
from all over America.

01:06:13.486 --> 01:06:16.450
Why not move confidently
into their midst ?

01:06:16.527 --> 01:06:19.902
Welcome to the Flamingo Hotel, sir.

01:06:19.979 --> 01:06:22.280
Sir ?

01:06:22.347 --> 01:06:24.198
Yeah, hi. Right. Okay.

01:06:24.265 --> 01:06:26.653
<i>~ Let me stay in your arms ~</i>

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.155
<i>~ I'm addicted to your charms ~</i>

01:06:29.222 --> 01:06:32.934
<i>~ You're gettin' to be
a habit with me ~</i>

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:37.289
<i>~ I used to think your love
was something that I ~</i>

01:06:37.356 --> 01:06:39.590
<i>~ Could take ~</i>

01:06:39.657 --> 01:06:42.409
<i>- ~ Or leave alone ~
- My arrival was badly timed.</i>

01:06:42.476 --> 01:06:46.177
<i>~ But now I couldn't do
without my supply ~</i>

01:06:46.244 --> 01:06:48.997
<i>~ I need you for my own ~</i>

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.050
This here model
is one that we had to use...

01:06:58.118 --> 01:07:01.474
when we took on them little peckerheads
down there at Kent State.

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.967
This baby here--

01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:08.608
I'm a police chief
from Michigan.

01:07:08.676 --> 01:07:10.690
Look, fella, I have
explained to you.

01:07:10.757 --> 01:07:15.811
I have this postcard which says that
I have a reservation in this hotel.

01:07:15.878 --> 01:07:19.493
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you're on the late list.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.752
- So your reservation
has been transferred to...
- It's okay.

01:07:23.818 --> 01:07:27.424
the...Moonlight Motel...

01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:29.917
which is just out
on Paradise Boulevard.

01:07:29.994 --> 01:07:32.957
We've already paid
for our goddamn room !

01:07:33.034 --> 01:07:35.997
It's actually a very fine
place of lodging, and it's
only 16 blocks from here.

01:07:36.074 --> 01:07:38.012
It has a pool,
sauna, steam.

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:40.389
You listen to me,
you filthy little faggot !

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:42.759
I want a manager down here,
now, now !

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:45.788
Because I'm sick of listening
to your dog shit !

01:07:45.865 --> 01:07:48.800
I am...very sorry, sir.

01:07:48.867 --> 01:07:51.687
- Get off of me ! Get away from me !
- Can I call you a cab ?

01:07:51.754 --> 01:07:53.786
Sure, and I'll call you
a cocksucker !

01:07:53.863 --> 01:07:56.577
Of course, I could hear what
the clerk was really saying.

01:07:56.644 --> 01:07:59.579
Listen, you fuzzy
little shithead !

01:07:59.656 --> 01:08:02.754
I've been fucked around
in my time...

01:08:02.821 --> 01:08:05.639
by a fairly good
cross section...

01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:07.941
of mean-tempered,
rule-crazy cops...

01:08:08.009 --> 01:08:11.106
and now...
it's my turn.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:16.898
So fuck you, Officer.
I'm in charge.

01:08:16.965 --> 01:08:21.368
Hey, listen, I really hate
to interrupt, but I wonder
if I could slide on through.

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:24.032
The name is Raoul Duke. I think
my attorney made the reservations.

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:26.334
Duke, Raoul.

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:28.406
Certainly, sir.

01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:32.309
My bags-- My bags are out there in
that white Cadillac convertible there.

01:08:32.386 --> 01:08:34.179
Maybe somebody could
bring it to the room for me.

01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:38.466
Oh, yeah, uh, let me get
a quart of Wild Turkey...

01:08:38.533 --> 01:08:40.509
two-fifths of Bacardi...

01:08:40.576 --> 01:08:43.194
- some ice for the room, and let's see--
- You just calm down !

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:45.341
Shit, let's try some lime chunks.
What do you think ?

01:08:45.408 --> 01:08:47.777
I say okay.

01:08:47.844 --> 01:08:50.970
- You don't worry about a thing.
- Now, calm down.

01:08:51.037 --> 01:08:54.174
You don't hesitate
to call me-- Sven.

01:08:54.241 --> 01:08:56.091
All right, Sven.

01:08:56.158 --> 01:08:58.941
Thank you very much.

01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:01.828
- You-- You--
- I know, I know, I know.

01:09:01.895 --> 01:09:05.404
It's hideous. You're gonna
be fine, though. You're doing well.

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:07.331
I'll see you later.
Wait. Don't touch it.

01:09:07.388 --> 01:09:10.362
Good night. Pardon me. Bye, Sven.

01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:14.937
- Look what you did !
Look what you did !

01:09:15.014 --> 01:09:18.551
Goddamn you, we wouldn't stay
in this hotel if you begged us !

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:22.618
<i>~ Magic moments ~</i>

01:09:22.685 --> 01:09:27.095
<i>~ When two hearts are caring ~</i>

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:31.573
<i>~ Magic moments ~</i>

01:09:31.651 --> 01:09:36.504
<i>- ~ Memories we've been sharing ~
- Home, sweet home.</i>

01:09:36.571 --> 01:09:38.546
Whoa. What kind of sick shit--

01:09:38.624 --> 01:09:40.895
Oh, shit !

01:09:40.962 --> 01:09:42.814
Shit. What the fuck ?

01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:44.731
Stop, stop, stop.

01:09:44.798 --> 01:09:48.788
Ow ! She's biting my leg off !
You degenerate pig. Please !

01:09:48.865 --> 01:09:50.486
Can't be helped.

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:54.744
-My fucking leg !
-That's "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."

01:09:54.811 --> 01:09:57.746
Lucy, be cool,
goddamn it.

01:09:57.822 --> 01:10:01.208
Remember what happened
at the airport, okay ? Come on.

01:10:04.506 --> 01:10:08.054
No more of that, okay ?
That's my client, Lucy.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:11.919
That's Mr. Duke,
the famous journalist.

01:10:11.996 --> 01:10:14.489
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.

01:10:14.556 --> 01:10:16.408
He's on our side.

01:10:16.475 --> 01:10:19.199
He loves artists.

01:10:19.266 --> 01:10:23.053
Lucy paints portraits
of Barbra Streisand.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:26.362
Yeah. Right ?

01:10:26.429 --> 01:10:29.459
Um, I drew these from TV.

01:10:29.536 --> 01:10:31.569
Really.

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:34.906
She came
all the way down--

01:10:34.973 --> 01:10:37.457
- What's the name of that town ?
- Montana.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:41.111
Montana. Just to give
these portraits to Barbra.

01:10:42.617 --> 01:10:46.232
We're goin' over to the Americana
tonight to meet her backstage.

01:10:46.299 --> 01:10:49.167
I desperately needed peace, rest...

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:51.545
sanctuary.

01:10:51.612 --> 01:10:53.655
I hadn't counted on this:

01:10:53.722 --> 01:10:57.548
finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind
of preternatural courtship.

01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.697
Well...

01:10:59.774 --> 01:11:03.829
they must have, uh,
brought the car around by now.

01:11:04.117 --> 01:11:05.708
So...

- One kiss. Why not ?

- Oh, Lucy.

I met her on the plane.

01:12:11.985 --> 01:12:15.495
Yeah.
She's a religious freak.

01:12:15.571 --> 01:12:18.314
I gave her a cap
before I realized--

01:12:18.382 --> 01:12:21.000
Jesus, she's never
even had a drink.

01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:23.175
Well, it'll probably work out.

01:12:23.243 --> 01:12:26.340
We can keep her loaded, and then
peddle her ass at the drug convention.

01:12:26.417 --> 01:12:29.093
Yeah, she's perfect
for this gig.

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:33.092
These cops'll go 50 bucks a head
to beat her into submission
and then gang-fuck her.

01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:35.432
We can set her up in one
of these backstreet motels...

01:12:35.499 --> 01:12:39.661
hang pictures of Jesus
all over the room, and then turn
these fucking pigs loose on her.

01:12:39.728 --> 01:12:42.624
Hell, she's strong, man.
She'll hold her own.

01:12:43.823 --> 01:12:46.153

I knew you were sick...

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.893

you actually say that kind of stuff.

This girl's a godsend.

make us a grand a day.

That's ugly, man.

01:13:00.049 --> 01:13:03.271
Well, I figure she can do
about four at a time.

more like two grand a day, maybe three.

be sane enough to work herself...

01:13:26.316 --> 01:13:29.442

some kind of cruel Samoan...

01:13:29.519 --> 01:13:33.288

dragged her to a Vegas hotel room...

01:13:33.355 --> 01:13:36.769
and then savagely penetrated
every orifice in her little body...

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:39.848

uncircumcised member.

Well, you'll go straight
to the gas chamber for this one.

they'll still send you back to Nevada...

and consensual sodomy.

a trifle high-strung.

01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:02.386
You won't need much.

01:22:03.422 --> 01:22:05.330
Just a...tiny taste.

01:22:05.407 --> 01:22:08.600
Let's have it.
Ah, there it is.

01:22:12.801 --> 01:22:14.652
- What is this shit ?
- That stuff...

01:22:14.719 --> 01:22:19.187
makes pure mescaline
seem like ginger beer, man.

01:22:20.866 --> 01:22:24.242
- Adrenochrome.
- Adrenochrome ? Hmm.

01:22:31.904 --> 01:22:34.551
Hello.

01:22:34.618 --> 01:22:38.070
- Hi, Lucy. God bless.
- Hmm ?

01:22:38.137 --> 01:22:40.027
Yeah, it's me.

01:22:40.094 --> 01:22:43.834
Hell, no, I taught the bastard
a lesson he'll never forget.

01:22:43.901 --> 01:22:46.999
What ? No, not dead.

01:22:47.066 --> 01:22:50.164
But he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.436
Yeah, I left him out there.

01:22:52.513 --> 01:22:56.090
I stomped him.
I pulled all his teeth out.

01:22:56.157 --> 01:22:58.007
I remember thinking, Jesus...

01:22:58.074 --> 01:23:00.568
what a terrible thing to lay
on somebody with a head full of acid.

01:23:00.635 --> 01:23:02.486
But we have a problem.

01:23:02.553 --> 01:23:06.676
That bastard cashed a bad check
downstairs and gave you as a reference.

01:23:06.744 --> 01:23:09.467
They'll be looking
for both of you.

01:23:09.535 --> 01:23:13.428
Yeah, I know, Lucy, but you
can't judge a book by its cover.

01:23:13.495 --> 01:23:16.219
Some people are
just basically rotten.

01:23:17.887 --> 01:23:22.452
Anyway, the last thing in the world
you wanna do is call this hotel again.

01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:26.547
- They'll trace the call,
put you behind bars.

01:23:26.614 --> 01:23:29.520
No, I'm moving
to the Tropicana right away.

01:23:31.036 --> 01:23:32.886
Hmm.

01:23:32.953 --> 01:23:36.214
I'll use a different name.
I'll let you know what it is.

01:23:39.963 --> 01:23:42.265
I gotta get off.

01:23:42.332 --> 01:23:45.142
Probably have
this phone tapped, baby.

01:23:45.209 --> 01:23:49.074
- Yeah, it was horrible,
but it's all over now.

01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:52.018
Oh, my God.
There's someone at the door.

01:23:52.085 --> 01:23:55.883
There's someone at the door.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.191
Christ ! Hey !

01:23:59.258 --> 01:24:02.010
No ! I'm innocent !
It was Duke !

01:24:02.068 --> 01:24:05.367
It was Duke !
Lucy ! Lucy !

01:24:05.434 --> 01:24:07.371
I love you ! I love you !

01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:17.622
Don't put that thing on me.
Aaaah ! Aaaah !

01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:21.459
[ Screaming Continues,
Echoing ]

01:24:21.526 --> 01:24:24.825
Whoo. Oh.

01:24:24.892 --> 01:24:27.923
Well--

01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:30.262
That's that.

01:24:30.329 --> 01:24:34.732
- That's the last we should
be hearing from Lucy, man.

01:24:37.396 --> 01:24:41.674
She's probably stuffing herself
down the incinerator about now.

01:24:44.628 --> 01:24:46.575
You know what we need ?

01:24:46.642 --> 01:24:48.982
We need some opium.

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.545
I remember
slumping on the bed.

01:25:01.621 --> 01:25:03.951
His performance
had given me a bad jolt.

01:25:04.018 --> 01:25:06.675
For a moment,
I thought his mind had snapped...

01:25:06.742 --> 01:25:09.591
that he actually believed he was being
attacked by invisible enemies.

01:25:09.648 --> 01:25:13.005
But the room was quiet again.

01:25:14.194 --> 01:25:16.055
Where'd you get this ?

01:25:16.122 --> 01:25:19.314
Never mind.
It's absolutely pure.

01:25:19.382 --> 01:25:22.192
What kind of monster client
have you hooked up with this time ?

01:25:22.259 --> 01:25:24.119
Satanism freak.

01:25:24.176 --> 01:25:26.996
I think there's only
one source for this stuff--

01:25:27.063 --> 01:25:29.806
the, uh, adrenaline gland...

01:25:29.873 --> 01:25:33.009
from a living human body.

01:25:33.077 --> 01:25:37.381
- I know. The guy didn't
have any cash to pay me.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:41.169
He offered me human blood,
said it would take me higher
than I'd ever been in my life.

01:25:41.237 --> 01:25:43.625
- I thought he was kidding...
- Oh.

01:25:43.702 --> 01:25:48.429
so I told him I'd just as soon have
an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome...

01:25:48.496 --> 01:25:51.182
or maybe just a fresh
adrenaline gland...

01:25:51.249 --> 01:25:53.110
to chew on.

01:25:53.167 --> 01:25:55.920
I could already feel
the stuff working on me.

01:25:55.987 --> 01:26:00.014
The first wave felt like a combination
of mescaline and methedrine.

01:26:00.081 --> 01:26:02.508
Maybe I should take a swim,
I thought.

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:04.435
Yes, sir.

01:26:06.353 --> 01:26:09.930
They nailed this guy
for child molesting.

01:26:11.378 --> 01:26:13.287
He swore he didn't do it.

01:26:13.364 --> 01:26:17.074
"Why should I fuck with children ?"
he said. "They're too small."

01:26:17.141 --> 01:26:19.472
Christ, what could I say ?

01:26:19.539 --> 01:26:23.624
Even a goddamn werewolf
is entitled to legal counsel.

01:26:23.701 --> 01:26:26.665
I didn't dare
to turn the creep down.

01:26:28.112 --> 01:26:32.207
He might have picked up a letter opener
and gone after my...

01:26:32.274 --> 01:26:34.759
pineal gland.

01:26:34.835 --> 01:26:36.743
- You know ?
- Yeah.

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:39.151
- Crazy.
- Why not ?

01:26:39.218 --> 01:26:42.382
Shit. We should
get some of that.

01:26:42.449 --> 01:26:45.671
Just...eat a big handful
and see what happens.

01:26:45.805 --> 01:26:48.453
Some of what ?

01:26:51.848 --> 01:26:53.708
Extract of pineal.

01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:56.489
Sure, that's a good idea.

01:26:56.556 --> 01:27:00.517
One whiff of that stuff will turn you
into something out of a goddamn...

01:27:02.185 --> 01:27:04.487
medical encyclopedia, man.

01:27:06.444 --> 01:27:08.745
Beautiful
fucking tits.

01:27:08.812 --> 01:27:12.130
Man, your head would
swell up like a watermelon.

01:27:12.207 --> 01:27:16.167
- You'd gain about
a hundred pounds in two hours.
- Right !

01:27:16.236 --> 01:27:18.564
Grow claws,
bleeding warts.

01:27:18.631 --> 01:27:20.195
Yes.

01:27:20.262 --> 01:27:24.194
And then you'd notice
about six huge, hairy tits...

01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:26.236
swelling up on your back.

01:27:26.314 --> 01:27:28.040
Fantastic !

01:27:28.107 --> 01:27:30.112
You'd go blind.

01:27:31.464 --> 01:27:34.187
Your body would turn to wax.

01:27:34.255 --> 01:27:36.257
They'd have to put you
in a wheelbarrow.

01:27:36.324 --> 01:27:38.214
And when you scream for help...

01:27:38.281 --> 01:27:40.996
you'll sound
like a raccoon.

01:27:43.047 --> 01:27:45.800
Man, I'll try
just about anything...

01:27:45.867 --> 01:27:48.926
but I'd never in hell
touch a pineal gland.

01:27:49.003 --> 01:27:51.717
Finish the fucking story, man !

01:27:51.785 --> 01:27:54.921
What happened ?
What about the glands ?

01:27:54.988 --> 01:27:58.334
Jesus, that stuff got right
on top of you, didn't it ?

01:27:58.411 --> 01:28:02.122
Look at your face.
You're about to explode.

01:28:09.123 --> 01:28:11.549
Maybe you could just...

01:28:11.626 --> 01:28:14.686
shove me into the pool.

01:28:14.762 --> 01:28:19.297
Man, if I put you in the pool right now,
you'll sink like a goddamn stone.

01:28:19.364 --> 01:28:23.872
You took too much, man.
You took too much. Too much.

01:28:26.154 --> 01:28:28.006
Don't try and fight it.

01:28:28.073 --> 01:28:30.758
You'll get brain bubbles,
strokes, aneurysms.

01:28:30.825 --> 01:28:34.681
You'll just wither up
and die.

01:28:34.757 --> 01:28:39.072
They continue
killing innocent people !

01:28:39.139 --> 01:28:42.754
Allowing the hopes for peace and
freedom of millions of people...

01:28:42.821 --> 01:28:44.960
to be suffocated.

01:28:45.027 --> 01:28:47.962
So tonight, we do.

01:28:48.039 --> 01:28:50.340
The great silent majority.

01:28:50.407 --> 01:28:52.258
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:55.040
Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

01:28:55.107 --> 01:28:59.038
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

01:29:05.157 --> 01:29:10.594
<i>~ I feel the cottonwood
whispering above ~</i>

01:29:10.661 --> 01:29:14.306
<i>~ Tammy, Tammy ~</i>

01:29:14.373 --> 01:29:17.018
<i>~ Tammy's in love ~</i>

01:29:19.014 --> 01:29:22.658
What kind of rat-bastard
psychotic would play that song
right now, at this moment ?

01:29:24.423 --> 01:29:27.453
<i>~ Tammy, Tammy ~</i>

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.429
When I came to...

01:29:29.505 --> 01:29:32.191
the general back-alley ambience
of the suite was so rotten...

01:29:32.258 --> 01:29:35.489
so incredibly foul.

01:29:36.803 --> 01:29:39.584
How long had I
been lying there ?

01:29:39.651 --> 01:29:42.241
All these signs of violence.

01:29:42.308 --> 01:29:44.514
What had happened ?

01:29:44.581 --> 01:29:46.911
There was evidence in this room
of excessive consumption...

01:29:46.978 --> 01:29:51.323
of almost every type of drug
known to civilized man since 1544 A.D.

01:29:58.342 --> 01:30:00.672
Oh, ah, Debbie.

01:30:00.739 --> 01:30:02.677
Thank God.

01:30:02.753 --> 01:30:05.372
Oh, Debbie. Hmm ? Look.

01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:11.836
What kind of addict would need
all these coconut husks
and crushed honeydew rinds ?

01:30:12.325 --> 01:30:15.258
Would the presence of junkies account
for all these uneaten french fries ?

01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:18.366
These puddles of glazed ketchup
on the bureau ?

01:30:18.433 --> 01:30:20.437
Maybe so...

01:30:20.513 --> 01:30:22.844
but then why all this booze...

01:30:22.911 --> 01:30:25.213
and these crude pornographic
photos smeared with mustard...

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.514
that had dried
to a hard, yellow crust ?

01:30:27.581 --> 01:30:30.401
These were not the hoofprints
of your normal God-fearing junkie.

01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:33.115
It was too savage,
too aggressive.

01:30:33.183 --> 01:30:35.608
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- What ? What ?

01:30:35.675 --> 01:30:37.535
Jesus God, man. Huh ?

01:30:37.602 --> 01:30:41.429
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them !

01:30:43.424 --> 01:30:46.177
Grim memories
and bad flashbacks.

01:30:46.244 --> 01:30:48.094
Get a grip.

01:30:48.161 --> 01:30:50.713
Maintain.

01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:54.357
How many nights and weird mornings
had this shit been going on ?

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.649
- Something ugly had happened.
I was sure of it.

01:31:19.262 --> 01:31:22.196
Who is that ? Oh.
Shit, that's me.

01:31:26.809 --> 01:31:29.916
- Help me !
- What the fuck ?

01:31:29.983 --> 01:31:32.698
Oh, shit.

01:31:35.833 --> 01:31:38.354
- You're under arrest !
- She must have used a pass key.

01:31:38.431 --> 01:31:41.721
I was polishing my shoes
in the closet when I noticed
her sneaking in, so I took her.

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:44.598
- What made you do it ?
Who paid you off ?
- Nobody ! I'm the maid !

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:47.533
- You're just as much
a part of it as they are.
- Part of what ?

01:31:47.609 --> 01:31:51.023
The goddamn dope ring. You must
know what's going on in this hotel.

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.172
Why do you think
we're here ?

01:31:53.249 --> 01:31:56.720
I know you're the cops, but I thought
you were just here for the convention.

01:31:56.796 --> 01:32:00.210
I swear. All I wanted to do
was clean up the room.

01:32:00.287 --> 01:32:03.596
- I don't know anything about no dope.
- Come on, baby.

01:32:03.672 --> 01:32:06.166
Don't try to tell us you never heard
of the Grange Gorman.

01:32:06.233 --> 01:32:08.621
I swear to Jesus
I never heard of that stuff.

01:32:08.697 --> 01:32:12.111
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe she's not part of it.

01:32:12.188 --> 01:32:14.873
I swear I'm not.
I swear.

01:32:17.846 --> 01:32:19.707
In that case,
maybe she can help.

01:32:19.774 --> 01:32:22.075
Oh, yes, I'll help you
all you want.

01:32:22.142 --> 01:32:25.556
- I hate dope.
- So do we.

01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:29.363
I think we should put her on the
payroll, see what she comes up with.

01:32:29.431 --> 01:32:31.541
- You think you can handle it ?
- What ?

01:32:31.608 --> 01:32:33.613
One phone call every day.

01:32:33.689 --> 01:32:36.441
Don't worry if it doesn't add up.
That's our problem.

01:32:36.508 --> 01:32:38.579
Y-You'd pay me for that ?

01:32:38.646 --> 01:32:41.686
You're damn right
we would.

01:32:41.754 --> 01:32:44.334
But the first time that you say anything
about this to anybody...

01:32:44.410 --> 01:32:47.057
you will go straight to prison
for the rest of your life.

01:32:47.125 --> 01:32:48.985
- What's your name ?
- Alice.

01:32:49.052 --> 01:32:50.903
Prove it !

01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:54.355
- Okay.
- Just ring Linen Service
and ask for Alice.

01:32:54.422 --> 01:32:56.494
All right, Alice.

01:32:59.226 --> 01:33:03.696
You'll be contacted
by Inspector Rock, Arthur Rock.

01:33:03.772 --> 01:33:07.215
He'll be posing as a politician, but
you'll have no problem recognizing him.

01:33:07.292 --> 01:33:11.310
That's right, Inspector Rock
will pay you in cash...

01:33:11.387 --> 01:33:14.513
- $1,000 on the ninth of every month.
- Oh, Lord !

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.488
I'd do just about
anything for that.

01:33:16.564 --> 01:33:19.058
- You and a lot of other people.
- Come here.

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:22.098
The password is:
"One hand washes the other."

01:33:22.165 --> 01:33:25.877
The minute you hear that,
you say, "l fear nothing."

01:33:25.944 --> 01:33:27.881
- Say it.
- I fear nothing.

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:30.029

Don't bother
to make up the room.

01:33:37.433 --> 01:33:40.243
Just leave a pile of towels and soap
outside the door exactly at midnight.

01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:44.108
That way we won't have to risk another
one of these little incidents, will we ?

01:33:44.184 --> 01:33:47.541
- Whatever you say, gentlemen.
- Thank God for decent people.

01:33:47.675 --> 01:33:50.706
Say it again !
I fear nothing !

01:33:50.773 --> 01:33:54.570
Terrible gibberish. Splintered
memories looming up out of the time fog.

on the main nerve right now.

01:34:03.507 --> 01:34:05.368
Yeah, don't get me started.

01:34:05.426 --> 01:34:08.332
The owner always wanted to run away and
join the circus when he was a kid.

01:34:08.408 --> 01:34:11.468
Now the son of a bitch
owns the circus.

01:34:11.544 --> 01:34:14.737
Ah, man,
a real license to steal.

01:34:14.804 --> 01:34:17.940
Oh, yeah. The American Dream
come true, man.

01:34:18.007 --> 01:34:20.174
Pure Horatio Alger.

01:34:20.241 --> 01:34:22.380
Yeah. Welcome
to the happy place.

01:34:24.433 --> 01:34:27.886
Listen, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

01:34:27.953 --> 01:34:29.928
How much for the ape ?

01:34:30.004 --> 01:34:32.422
How much you got ?

01:34:32.498 --> 01:34:36.592
How much do you think you'd take for the
ape ? Just wait here. I'll be back.

01:34:36.659 --> 01:34:39.690
Madness. It made no sense at all.

01:34:39.767 --> 01:34:41.618

- You poor fools don't understand.

There was every reason to believe
that we'd been heading for trouble...

01:35:35.053 --> 01:35:37.440
that we'd pushed our luck
a bit too far.

01:35:37.517 --> 01:35:40.902
Oh, gosh ! God.

01:35:42.255 --> 01:35:44.259
Right. Uh--

01:37:01.927 --> 01:37:05.831
Okay.
Let's see here.

01:37:12.937 --> 01:37:16.715
The mentality of Las Vegas
is so grossly atavistic...

01:37:16.782 --> 01:37:20.292
that a really massive crime
often slips by unrecognized.

01:37:25.384 --> 01:37:29.000
North Vegas is where you go when you've
fucked up once too often on the strip...

01:37:29.067 --> 01:37:32.932
- and when you're not even welcome
in the cut-rate downtown places.

01:37:37.544 --> 01:37:41.409
The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like
a fairly safe haven from our storms.

01:37:41.486 --> 01:37:43.720
No hassles, no talk.

01:37:43.788 --> 01:37:46.272
Just a place to rest
and regroup.

01:37:46.348 --> 01:37:48.765
I wasn't even hungry.

01:37:48.841 --> 01:37:51.910
There was nothing in the atmosphere of
the North Star to put me on my guard.

Two glasses of ice water

01:37:57.865 --> 01:38:00.618
Two glasses of ice water

01:38:27.115 --> 01:38:30.692
but I knew that our peace
was about to be shattered.

01:38:30.759 --> 01:38:32.609
What was that ?

01:38:43.273 --> 01:38:45.124
What is this ?

01:38:45.192 --> 01:38:48.318
- It's a napkin.
- Don't give me that bullshit.

I know what that means,

- What's wrong with you ?
The question mark was emphasized.

01:38:58.119 --> 01:39:00.603
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

01:39:00.679 --> 01:39:05.503
I gotta take a lot of shit
in this place, but I don't have
to take it off no spic pimp !

- Thirty-five cents.

- How much is that lemon meringue pie ?
- Thirty-five cents.

01:40:09.477 --> 01:40:13.015
Whoo ! What a waste of talent.

01:40:13.092 --> 01:40:16.573
No, honey,
I mean the whole pie.

01:40:18.242 --> 01:40:20.093

01:40:45.948 --> 01:40:47.808
Five.

01:41:12.578 --> 01:41:14.745
I'll be in the car.

01:42:08.737 --> 01:42:11.939
The sight of the blade
had triggered bad memories.

01:42:12.006 --> 01:42:15.066
The glazed look in her eyes
said her throat had been cut.

01:42:15.142 --> 01:42:18.432
- She was still in the grip
of paralysis when we left.

01:42:27.294 --> 01:42:29.433
It was all over now.

01:42:29.509 --> 01:42:32.250
We'd abused every rule
that Vegas lived by.

01:42:32.317 --> 01:42:37.410
Threatening the locals, abusing
the tourists, terrifying the help.

01:42:37.478 --> 01:42:39.712
The only chance now,
I felt...

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:43.222
was the possibility that
we'd gone to such excess...

01:42:43.299 --> 01:42:46.013
that nobody in the position to bring
the hammer down on us...

01:42:46.081 --> 01:42:48.027

01:42:50.817 --> 01:42:53.234

- Right here, right here.
- Ridiculous, man.

01:44:19.964 --> 01:44:23.637
Just say you were hitchhiking
to the airport, and I picked you up.

01:44:23.964 --> 01:44:26.035
- You bastard.
- Get out.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.416
Hey, hey !
Hey, listen.

01:44:38.493 --> 01:44:41.341
Don't take any guff
from these swine.

Yeah, explaining my position. Some
asshole wrote a poem about that once.

01:44:50.998 --> 01:44:54.105

No more of the speed
that fueled the '60s.

01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:56.142
That was the fatal flaw
in Tim Leary's trip.

01:45:56.218 --> 01:45:59.182
He crashed around America,
selling "consciousness expansion"...

01:45:59.259 --> 01:46:02.289
without ever giving a thought
to the grim meat-hook realities
that were lying in wait...

01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:05.742
for all those people
who took him seriously.

01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:07.985
All those pathetically eager
acid freaks...

01:46:08.052 --> 01:46:11.831

understanding for three bucks a hit.

and failure...

What Leary took down with him was the
central illusion of a whole lifestyle...

01:46:19.896 --> 01:46:21.968
that he helped create.

failed seekers...

01:46:26.293 --> 01:46:30.444
