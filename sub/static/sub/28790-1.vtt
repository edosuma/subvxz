01:07.535 --> 01:09.501
   Oh, Doug, we should stop.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.369
     Someone's at the door.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.303
          Oh, come on.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.072
     Don't be such a tease.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.673
I'm hard as a diamond right now.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.475
        And you know you
       want it real good.

01:16.477 --> 01:20.479
 Oh god, it just feels so wrong
 with my husband, your brother,

01:20.481 --> 01:23.615
    downstairs, and my son,
   your nephew, down the hall

01:23.617 --> 01:26.251
     with his best friend,
      and the babysitter,

01:26.253 --> 01:29.588
my trusted employee, presumably
    somewhere in the house.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.789
  That's what makes it so hot.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.757
          Now come on.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.791
   Let's get this thingy off.

01:32.793 --> 01:33.759
 And let me see those titties.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.827
        Let me see them.

     [controllers clicking]

01:41.602 --> 01:43.102
           Yo, Hugh.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.303
      Isn't it crazy that
     we're going to college

01:44.305 --> 01:45.604
    in, like, a whole week?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.372
       I just hope I have
       better luck there

01:47.374 --> 01:48.874
   than I did in high school.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.742
Not with my studies, of course.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.144
      But with the ladies.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.213
        You can't go to
       college a virgin.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.115
        You'll be toast.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.450
     You'll get laughed out
     of every lecture hall.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.818
       Jace, I've tried.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.620
        But not everyone
       can be the captain

02:01.622 --> 02:04.890
   of the varsity and junior
    varsity football teams.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.458
        What about your
        hot babysitter?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.426
        Oh, field goal.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.127
             Cool.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.296
  I wouldn't know what to say.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.400
         Hi, big boys.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.136
   Hope I'm not interrupting.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.138
     I just needed a break
       from babysitting.

02:19.140 --> 02:23.242
I'm not supposed to get off for
  I don't know how many hours.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.677
  And I thought maybe we could
    do something about that.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.912
         About to show
       you how it's done.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.251
              Hey.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.252
         You know I'm a
      quarterback, right?

02:37.892 --> 02:40.292
     That's how it's done.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.761
   Oh, you're a quarterback?

02:42.763 --> 02:45.464
 Lucky for you I'm a tight end.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.299
         I didn't know
      you liked football.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.567
   What's your favorite team?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.269
  Mine's the Monterey Jambos.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.603
    Jace takes the handoff.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.406
  And he's going all the way.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.775
           [moaning]

02:56.777 --> 02:58.810
         I haven't been
       touched in months.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.880
      It's so hard with my
 husband, your brother, always

03:01.882 --> 03:03.515
        so busy with his
       work, tax season.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.349
        No more talking.

03:04.351 --> 03:04.783
        No more talking.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.985
              No?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.186
  This is going to get nasty.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.354
          More noise.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.623
           Be louder.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.558
            Louder.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.825
           [moaning]
          - Oh, Doug.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.826
        That's it, yeah.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.827
           Oh, Doug.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.397

      to just stare at it.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.804
 Only if you return the favor.

03:25.806 --> 03:30.909
     [laughs] You're crazy.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.411

      Hugh, get in on her.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.849
         Come on, Hugh.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.617
        Come here, man.

        [doorbell rings]

03:42.590 --> 03:43.889
         Someone should
     probably go get that.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.224
   You two have fun, though.

03:45.226 --> 03:45.958
            Be safe.

      HUGH: Mom, someone's
          at the door.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.697
        Then answer it.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.764
         Mommy's busy.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.233
     - You're a bad mommy.
            - Yeah?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.234
      You're a bad mommy.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.301
   You think I'm a bad mommy?

03:56.303 --> 03:57.402
         I think you're
        the worst mommy.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.470
     Call social services.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.805
   Let's call them right now.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.840
      You're going to call
     social services on me.

       RICHARD: Yes, and
        your final page

04:02.977 --> 04:05.010

        on the fax now.

          Sorry, dad.
           I'm on it.

            A storm?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.615
   What do you mean, doctor?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.550
     Everyone in this town
   was supposed to evacuate,

04:45.552 --> 04:47.419
     but now it's too late.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.755
       Hurricane Muff is
        already upon us.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.923
       My whole family's
         in this house.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.359
   I'm the son, Hugh Dangler.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.695
   We're all going to have to
hole up here until Muff passes.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.603
  So you're a real scientist.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.937
        I love science.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.673
            Really?

05:07.675 --> 05:11.910
   So do I. I should probably
 get out of these wet clothes.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.981
     Maybe you can think of
      a way to warm me up?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.016
    I'll go get you a towel.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.951
           [running]

05:21.588 --> 05:23.755
 I have rubbers in my JanSport.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.624
         Be right back.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.627
         Don't be long.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.095
           Too late.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.697

     I want you to make me
    feel like a woman again.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.804
    I want you to stick your
     finger in my butthole.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.739
  I'm going to go freshen up.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.674
             What?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.042
          Freshen up?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.711
              Why?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.647

        all this racket?

    Oh my God, look at that.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.526
              No.

           Oh my God.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.028
         What do we do?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.757
       I think he's dead.

    anyone who died before.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.465

07:46.467 --> 07:47.732
     Looks like I'm working
      late again tonight.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.902
       What if we put his
       blood back in him?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.104
          Yeah, that's
      where blood lives--

07:53.106 --> 07:54.806
       inside of bodies.

07:54.808 --> 07:59.478
    I know one way to get a
   man's blood pumping again.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.481
         Oh, honey, no.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.114

08:22.669 --> 08:23.568
          Do we fuck?

08:23.570 --> 08:24.269

08:26.673 --> 08:28.173
  We can fuck around the body.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.674
    We can fuck on the-- on
     the side of the body.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.209
    We don't even have to be
  in the same-- (DEFENSIVELY)

   no one else has any ideas.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.563
            It's OK.

        There are no bad
       ideas in science.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.883
     Who the hell is this?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.583
 DR. BUNNY: Dr. Bunny Van Clit.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.852
You can call me Bunny Van Clit--

08:41.855 --> 08:46.057
      Dr. Bunny Van Clit,
        Bunny for short.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.859
    I'm a weather scientist.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.694
 Maybe we should call someone.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.130
        My cousin, Orin,
     lives down the street.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.765
       Like the police--

08:53.767 --> 08:55.700
             9-1-1.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.802
  Yeah, I know those numbers.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.739
          I'll do it.

09:16.723 --> 09:17.822
         Oh, I'm fine.

09:17.824 --> 09:18.323
          How are you?

09:18.325 --> 09:19.090
             Jace!

09:19.092 --> 09:20.225
         Oh, oh, sorry.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.726
  I got to report a dead body.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.727
         Somebody died.

      for a private Dick?

09:37.578 --> 09:38.877
   I'm Detective Brock Cross.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.579
         It was awful.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.780
  I went to go grab the lube--

09:41.782 --> 09:43.915
 And I'm here to work a case--

09:43.917 --> 09:47.052
  work it long, work it hard.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.653
     And whoever is guilty
        is going to feel

09:48.655 --> 09:50.322
   the full force of the law.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.190
     (CRYING OUT) Oh, shit.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.201
No, why didn't anybody warn me.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.636
              Ow.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.070
    (WHINING) What, did this
     come out of my belly?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.142
       Sorry about that.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.977
   I want you to know it had
  nothing to do with the body.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.212
I had a heavy lunch, and I think
  I just went up those stairs

10:14.214 --> 10:15.213
     a little bit too fast.

10:18.385 --> 10:23.021
  It is my expert opinion that
   that man up there is dead.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.922
   I believe he was murdered.

10:23.924 --> 10:24.956
        [gasping loudly]

10:24.958 --> 10:26.191
      Murdered on purpose?

10:26.193 --> 10:27.993
 But who would do such a thing?

10:27.995 --> 10:30.629
  No one would be crazy enough
 to venture out in this storm.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.697
 Which can mean only one thing.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.216
 The killer must be one of us.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.734
     (SPEAKING RAPIDLY) The
   killer must be one of us.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.818

  Kid wants to be a detective.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.938
      Too bad only one of
      us has a badge, hm?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.239
             What?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.173
            Damn it.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.408
      This isn't my coat.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.276
       What do we do now,
        Detective Cross?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.078
       I have a Jansport
        full of rubbers

10:47.080 --> 10:50.248
    if anybody's interested?

10:50.250 --> 10:53.184
   Shouldn't we try to figure
   out what happened to Doug?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.897
       (CHUCKLING) Sure.

10:54.898 --> 10:56.609
       How exactly do you
      propose we do that?

10:56.610 --> 10:58.321
  Should I take you all up to
  a room, grill you one by one

10:58.325 --> 10:59.891
       until the murderer
    drops down to his knees?

11:03.664 --> 11:04.379
         Or her knees.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.095
        Jesus, you know
     what, we're doing it.

11:05.098 --> 11:05.964
         You're first.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.368
         One question.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.004
    I want you to take your
      time with this one.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.139
    You should get it right.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.007
     Did you kill this guy?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.008
              No.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.743
  DETECTIVE CROSS: Oh, well--

11:18.745 --> 11:20.345
  But I was downstairs in the
  linen closet when I heard--

11:20.347 --> 11:22.080
 Whoa, I'm not your boyfriend.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.848
  I don't care about your day.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.917
    I swear I didn't do it.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.119
      I'm just an innocent
       little babysitter.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.321
            Oh, my.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.923
How long you been working here?

11:31.925 --> 11:34.759
         Maybe a couple
       of days or months.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.194
   It's sort of hard to say--

11:36.196 --> 11:37.362

11:37.364 --> 11:38.329
     What's that lollipop?

       It's a blueberry.

            Mm-hmm.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.867

12:15.035 --> 12:17.335
     I know what you mean.

      I feel like I should
       be doing science.

  in, and you wouldn't see me,

      you do your things.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.681
 he left me for another woman.

15:49.683 --> 15:54.419
   And the worst part is, he
    dumped me with a letter.

15:54.421 --> 15:58.456
   "Dear Dr. Bunny Van Clit,
    you filthy space whore."

15:58.458 --> 16:00.124
      There's three people
       you can talk to--

16:00.126 --> 16:01.326
good cop, bad cop, and hot cop.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.644
    And I got news for you.

16:02.645 --> 16:03.961
      Good cop's home with
      the flu, and bad cop

16:03.964 --> 16:05.463
      took the day off to
    spend it with his kids,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.465
    because he's a bad cop,
   but he's a hell of a dad.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.000
    BABS: You listen to me.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.103
     You are good-looking,
     you're a hard worker,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.339
     you're going to get to
    the bottom of this case.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.239
      Thank you very much.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.607
      Do you believe that?

16:16.609 --> 16:17.925
             Yeah.

16:17.926 --> 16:19.242
        You need to know
     you're going to do it.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.378
            I know.
       That's what hard.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.512
         You know what?
    You just got a little--

16:21.514 --> 16:23.281
       JACE: Sometimes I
      wanted to kill Doug.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.683
 Like y'all remember when I was
  having sex there really hot,

16:25.685 --> 16:29.687

  and he ate out all the 'za?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.556
     Ooh, I was so miffed.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.124
        I threw like two
      fumbles that night.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.592
               I

16:34.594 --> 16:37.228
  But you would never actually
    kill someone would you?

16:37.230 --> 16:40.465
       Jace is a football
      hero, not a killer.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.400
    It's not in his nature.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.103
It would be like the babysitter
     not being in the mood.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.004
          You know me.

           [giggling]

16:47.240 --> 16:49.007
       DR. BUNNY: I hate
      to break it to you,

16:49.009 --> 16:52.677
but you may not know each other
  quite as well as you think.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.712
 DETECTIVE CROSS: You-- you're
   literally the last person.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.781
    You really expect me to
 believe that you didn't do it?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.316
        Well, I didn't.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.650
      But you should know
      that a lot of people

16:59.652 --> 17:02.086
    down there seem to have
    something against Doug--

17:02.088 --> 17:03.588
        myself included.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.323
    DETECTIVE CROSS: What do
    you think you're doing?

17:05.325 --> 17:07.224
    I'm the detective here.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.027
    You're just a scientist.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.797
 I've won the Nobel Prize, the
Pulitzer, and the Ruby Scepter,

17:12.799 --> 17:14.298
       which you can only
     win if you've already

17:14.300 --> 17:15.767
won the Nobel and the Pulitzer.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.502
   It's very prestigious and
    practically unheard of.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.739
       Right now, in this
  house, all that means dick.

17:21.741 --> 17:26.243
    So stay in your lane and
   let me do my goddamn job.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.146
       I've got nothing.
       JACE: Aw, come on.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.748
  DETECTIVE CROSS: I'm sorry.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.349
    Honestly, I think I know
  less now than I did before.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.617
     Because quite frankly,
      I like all you guys.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.252
        And I hope that
      none of you did it.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.804
        But Dr. Van Clit
       said the murderer

17:35.805 --> 17:37.355
   must still be in the house
     because of the storm.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.756
        Yes, the killer
    could be any one of us.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.525
      It could even be me.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.794
      Oh my God, is it me?

17:42.796 --> 17:43.528
              No.

          [chuckling]

17:44.580 --> 17:45.629
        I thought it was
        me for a second.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.431
       So we could all--

17:46.433 --> 17:47.691
       all be murderers?

17:47.692 --> 17:48.950
   That sounds like something
     a murderer would say.

17:48.951 --> 17:50.209

17:51.471 --> 17:52.403
   like a murderer would say.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.205
             Stop.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.541
We can't all go around pointing
 fingers, saying that Jace did

17:56.543 --> 17:59.243
 it or Babs did it, or Babs did
  it, or fucking Babs did it.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.111
    (SHOUTING) Babs did it.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.245
    I knew it was you, Babs.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.613
      I knew it was Babs.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.314
           I'm sorry.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.749
           I'm sorry.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.183
       I know we're all a
     little bit worked up.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.752
     I just get so angry--

18:07.754 --> 18:09.153
   knowing that Babs did it.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.388
       If we're going to
       get through this,

18:10.390 --> 18:13.691
      we have to learn to
       trust each other.

18:13.693 --> 18:14.792
    And I think I know how.

           Oh, stop.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.206
  DR. BUNNY: Since the killer
     is still on the loose,

18:28.208 --> 18:31.509
  I think the best thing to do
 is to keep calm and stay put.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.643
           Oh my God.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.845
           That is so
     unbelievably dumb, OK?

18:33.847 --> 18:34.846
       It's a big house.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.380
  We got to search for clues.

    guys take the upstairs.

18:55.812 --> 18:56.989

          No, not yet.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.927
       DR. BUNNY: I think
      I've got something.

24:22.929 --> 24:23.794
         Look at this.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.897
      It could be a clue.

     could see my own balls

24:33.206 --> 24:36.207
    I feel like I'm missing
     out on something cool.

24:36.209 --> 24:39.710

       not what he seems.

     DR. BUNNY: (PLEADING)
   Wait, what are you doing?

24:46.052 --> 24:48.919
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
       Hey, what's that?

24:48.921 --> 24:51.822
    Why would somebody throw
   a tiny sword into a fire?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.858
 Maybe it's the murder weapon.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.893
  Well judging by the size of
the hilt, I'd say we're looking

24:55.895 --> 24:58.162
   for somebody under 3' 5".

24:58.164 --> 24:59.997
       How tall is Jace?

24:59.999 --> 25:03.968
  It's my mom's letter opener.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.745
      It's a little salty.

 The next batch will be better.

25:35.568 --> 25:38.135
    The letter opener alone
    doesn't prove anything.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.839
          What's your
   hypothesis, Dr. Van Clit.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.575
         My hypothesis?

25:44.577 --> 25:47.611
      I guess a triangle--

25:47.613 --> 25:49.813
      a type of triangle.

25:49.815 --> 25:53.217
       The only triangle
    here is a love triangle.

      lady, and she hired

25:55.221 --> 25:56.987
      some tiny little man
      to climb up his body

25:56.989 --> 25:58.155
   and stab him in the heart.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.324
      Case closed-- thanks
         to Dr. Vagina.

       (PROTESTING) That
        is not her name.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.194
  She's a Ruby-Scepter-winning
           scientist,

26:04.196 --> 26:06.564
  and we're lucky to have her.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.165
  You know I won the Scepter?

26:08.167 --> 26:09.333
           Of course.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.136
        I read "Science
      Weekly" every week.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.605
      I knew who you were
     the moment I saw you.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.007
  Do you think standing up for
this broad makes you a big man.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.810
              Huh?
    Is that what you think?

26:19.812 --> 26:21.245
           Think so?
  Is that what you think, huh?

     stones to cross Cross?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.020
  Finish the fucking job, huh?

26:30.022 --> 26:32.856
           Finish it.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.592
  Like mother, like daughter.

26:34.594 --> 26:39.229

     It's rough stuff, man.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.882
      I think she's sick.

      the hell's going on?

              Ah!

27:02.221 --> 27:03.020
         Open a window.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.054
        Clear the smoke.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.856
We just had this room re-tiled.

      DETECTIVE CROSS: I'm
    still not ruling it out.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.173
       What do you mean?

27:23.175 --> 27:23.907
          She's dead.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.209
         Yeah, exactly.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.677
    It's the perfect alibi.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.078
      A dead person can't
         be the killer.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.647
        And if we think
     she's not the killer,

27:29.649 --> 27:31.682
       then she got away
        with being dead.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.150
              So.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.785
   BABYSITTER: Oh my God, do
   you know what this means?

27:34.787 --> 27:37.821
    Yeah, it means I got to
  pay for two funerals-- two.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.858
  Ah, I need this shit like I
need a whole in my wife's head.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.794
    No, it means that we're
     all trapped in a house

28:36.982 --> 28:38.949
        And the vinegar.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.285
     Well, that's how it's
       supposed to work.

       you talking about?

    ask me those questions.

   asking me weird questions.

30:00.900 --> 30:04.101
     And nobody asks Jace,

   I don't know why we didn't
     question that fireman.

told me we closed the big deal.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.459
 Does that include all of Asia?

    Does that include China?

  should do now, Dr. Van Clit?

30:33.833 --> 30:35.132
    Why are you asking her?

     in the detective coat.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.536

       I don't think so.

   move your mother's body--

   can I tell you something?

           Of course.

I'm a great listener, so I hear.

  blindly following his lead.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.546
             Yeah.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.580

31:23.582 --> 31:26.183
  Oh, I don't know about that.

31:26.185 --> 31:29.319
   You got your PhD from Big
   State College University.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.422
 And your research on eruptions
     revolutionized the way

31:32.424 --> 31:34.124
 people think about eruptions.

31:34.126 --> 31:39.930
   I-- I feel like my science
   hasn't even been working.

       and 6 this season.

     But my volcano didn't
      even solve anything.

31:45.971 --> 31:46.637
     You'll figure it out.

31:46.639 --> 31:48.171
        What if I don't?

31:48.173 --> 31:49.673
      Maybe you should be
       the one in charge.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.175
    I mean, it's your family
  who keeps getting murdered.

31:52.177 --> 31:53.143
        No, I'm-- I'm--

31:53.145 --> 31:54.378
          I'm a nerd.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.113
        I can't be the--

31:56.115 --> 31:59.950
   you know, the guy, the one
 telling everybody what to do.

32:07.660 --> 32:11.628
  Oh, so that's why everybody
  keeps calling you a virgin.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.531
       I'll let you in on
        a little secret.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.234
  I used to be a virgin, too.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.437
Trust me, sex isn't everything.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.639
     HUGH: I may not have a
  Ruby Scepter, Dr. Van Clit,

32:22.641 --> 32:25.075
but even I know that's not true.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.343
            Come on.

     When Jace doesn't even
     know what Jace wants.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.103

            Or her.

41:07.515 --> 41:08.831
      Let's get this shit
      out your leg though.

41:08.834 --> 41:09.766
            - Yeah.
            - Right?

41:09.768 --> 41:11.318
   All right, so I'm gonna--

41:11.319 --> 41:12.869
     I'mma go real slow and
  twist it right out of there.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.003
             - OK.
       - Just right out.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.939
            - Yeah.
           - 1-- 1--

41:15.941 --> 41:18.508
             Yeah.
       BOTH: [screaming]

41:18.510 --> 41:20.176
         OK, I'mma pull
       first, then twist.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.711
          Pull, twist!
         - [screaming]

41:21.713 --> 41:23.246
  OK, let's just-- put it in.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.581
          [screaming]

41:24.582 --> 41:25.915
      I think it's caught
     in a bone, all right?

41:25.917 --> 41:28.084
         So I'mma go in
      first, and then out.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.152
        No, no, no, no.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.219
        That didn't feel
       good at all, huh?

41:30.222 --> 41:30.987
             Pray.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.121
             Pray.
              Go!

41:32.123 --> 41:33.623
          [screaming]

41:33.625 --> 41:34.591
          God dammit!

41:34.593 --> 41:36.259
          [screaming]

41:36.261 --> 41:37.126
        [haunting music]

41:37.128 --> 41:39.529
       A trail of glass.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.730
         There's more.

41:54.079 --> 41:56.079
       [water splashing]

41:56.081 --> 41:59.182
       Yeah, let's check
      this out right here.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.683
      It's a shower, man.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.519
  Respect the steam, brother.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.653
    What are you, an animal?

42:08.093 --> 42:11.661
         [eerie music]

42:48.033 --> 42:49.632
       [glass squeaking]

42:49.634 --> 42:53.036
             Jace?
             Jace?

42:53.038 --> 42:56.606
        [ominous music]

43:31.977 --> 43:33.776
             Jace?

43:33.778 --> 43:36.746
         Where are you?
             Jace!

43:38.049 --> 43:39.616
            [groans]
       HUGH: Oh, my god!

43:39.618 --> 43:40.817
        I got to-- I'll
       get you something!

43:40.819 --> 43:42.118
              Ah!
         - [whimpering]

43:42.120 --> 43:43.286
          HUGH: Help!
             Help!

43:43.288 --> 43:44.787
        Someone, please!

43:44.789 --> 43:47.223
       [whimpering] I've
       been stabbed, man!

43:47.225 --> 43:48.725
        In the bladder!
           - No, no!

43:48.727 --> 43:49.993
        There's piss and
       blood everywhere.

43:49.995 --> 43:52.061
        I feel it, man!

43:52.063 --> 43:53.363
          Oh, my god!

43:53.365 --> 43:55.064
     It's a golden shower!

43:55.066 --> 43:56.366
    [whimpering] I'm scared.

43:56.368 --> 43:57.767
    I'm fucking scared, man.

43:57.769 --> 43:58.768
              No!

43:58.770 --> 43:59.936
  No, you're going to be fine.

43:59.938 --> 44:01.337
         You're in peak
      physical condition.

44:01.339 --> 44:02.639
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
       Anybody else hear

44:02.641 --> 44:03.706
  all that scrambling around?

44:03.708 --> 44:05.274
I think this place has raccoons.

44:05.276 --> 44:06.042
              Ah!

44:06.044 --> 44:06.809
             Shh--

44:06.811 --> 44:08.411
        [dramatic music]

44:09.981 --> 44:11.314
              Hey.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.916
 I have something to tell you.

44:13.918 --> 44:15.918
      For the last couple
         of hours, I've

44:15.920 --> 44:18.921
      been doing a lot of
  thinking with my head, where

44:18.923 --> 44:20.990
      my brain lives, and
        it's always been

44:20.992 --> 44:25.728
    very easy for me to make
   the game-winning slap-shot

44:25.730 --> 44:27.430
       to the field goal.

44:27.432 --> 44:29.365
   Nothing but net, home run.

44:29.367 --> 44:31.401
   But you know what's hard?

44:31.403 --> 44:33.770
 Do you know what's hard, Hugh?

44:33.772 --> 44:34.404
          Do you know?

44:34.406 --> 44:35.371
             What?

44:35.373 --> 44:36.939
    Do you know what's hard?

44:36.941 --> 44:38.708
              No.

44:38.710 --> 44:41.244
   Looking in the mirror and,
 like, not knowing what you are

44:41.246 --> 44:42.445
       or what you want.

44:42.447 --> 44:43.846
        Please don't say
       things like that.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.148
     I'm not afraid to die.

44:45.150 --> 44:48.351
       I just wish I had
      more time, you know?

44:48.353 --> 44:51.354
 [gasping] More time to be gay.

44:51.356 --> 44:55.458
        [gasping] [sobs]
            - What?

44:55.460 --> 44:57.360
 Did I not pronounce it right?

44:57.362 --> 44:58.795
    I've never said it out--

44:58.797 --> 44:59.462
           out loud.

44:59.464 --> 45:00.730
             [sobs]

45:00.732 --> 45:03.199
 DETECTIVE CROSS: Ah, Jace, no.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.034
              No.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.869
      Don't worry, buddy.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.438
       Heaven's going to
        be super great.

45:08.440 --> 45:12.442
  It'll be full of hot angels
for you to hug, and kiss, and--

45:12.444 --> 45:13.944
           ah, shit.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.445
      You know, I think he
   died while I was talking.

45:19.451 --> 45:22.852
   I'm sorry if anybody else
     wanted to say goodbye.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.388
   Time of death, right now.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.956
        [dramatic music]

45:26.958 --> 45:27.924
             [thud]

45:27.926 --> 45:29.258
        [dramatic music]

45:38.136 --> 45:39.802
  DETECTIVE CROSS: What a day.

45:39.804 --> 45:41.237
   I mean, say what you will
   about the whole situation.

45:41.239 --> 45:44.307
       I-- I think we're
     making good progress.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.008
    I think you're an idiot!

45:46.010 --> 45:47.744
       Oh, go suck a test
        tube, you witch!

45:47.746 --> 45:49.378
         Stop fighting!

45:49.380 --> 45:53.316
      That's just what the
      killer wants, right?

45:53.318 --> 45:54.917
           Isn't it?

45:54.919 --> 45:56.052
       Does anybody know?

45:56.054 --> 45:57.520
           I'm sorry.

45:57.522 --> 46:00.189
   I am losing a lot of blood
   for my double stab wound.

46:00.191 --> 46:01.791
             [thud]
              Ah!

46:01.793 --> 46:04.494
 Oh, well I only see one wound.

46:04.496 --> 46:07.964
     But I can work on it.

46:07.966 --> 46:11.934
        I was a nurse at
     Saint Jesus' hospital.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.937
      When did I have time
      for all those jobs?

46:14.939 --> 46:17.206
        We have to stop
     playing by his rules.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.107
            Or hers.

46:18.109 --> 46:18.841
             Yeah.

46:18.843 --> 46:19.642
          But-- fine.

46:19.643 --> 46:20.442
  We know she's in the house.

46:20.445 --> 46:21.477
       We have seen her.

46:21.479 --> 46:22.879
            Or him.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.280
       We're going to set
     a trap for the killer.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.882
      All we need is bait.

46:25.884 --> 46:26.605
       RICHARD: Ah, geez.

46:26.606 --> 46:27.327
     DETECTIVE CROSS: Hey!

46:27.328 --> 46:28.049
     Just the guy we need!

46:28.052 --> 46:28.951
       Oh, you can read.

46:28.953 --> 46:29.886
            [whoosh]

46:31.089 --> 46:32.488
      Ah, that's what they
        used to call me.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.991
        Got forced into
       early retirement.

46:34.993 --> 46:37.360
  You never know you've peaked
 until you're on your way down.

46:37.362 --> 46:38.528
       [spritzing noise]

46:38.530 --> 46:40.263
      DR. BUNNY: A trap's
        a terrible idea.

46:40.265 --> 46:41.964
      We barely know what
      we're dealing with,

46:41.966 --> 46:43.966
   and you want to serve one
     of us up on a platter?

46:43.968 --> 46:45.201
      You trying to throw
       me off the trail?

46:45.203 --> 46:46.302
              Huh?

46:46.304 --> 46:47.937
  The trail that leads to you?

46:47.938 --> 46:49.571
  God, we're all just a bunch
   of ones and zeros to you,

46:49.574 --> 46:52.341
           aren't we?
- Real evidence will solve this.

46:52.343 --> 46:53.442
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
       Let's vote on it.

46:53.444 --> 46:54.477
              OK?

46:54.479 --> 46:55.511
 We either set an amazing trap.

46:55.513 --> 46:57.313
 It's going to be so much fun.

46:57.315 --> 47:01.117
 Or we search for clues, which
is going to be gross and boring.

47:01.119 --> 47:03.219
       Obviously, the two
       of us can't vote.

47:03.221 --> 47:04.387
            Richard?

47:04.389 --> 47:05.354
       [spritzing noise]

47:05.356 --> 47:07.824
     It's just you and me.

47:07.826 --> 47:08.591
           Alrighty.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.059
             Hugh?

47:10.061 --> 47:13.362
       Hugh, I may not be
      the best scientist,

47:13.364 --> 47:15.832
        but I know he is
      the worst detective.

47:15.834 --> 47:16.866
      Such a nasty woman.

47:16.868 --> 47:18.234
          Goddamn it.

47:18.236 --> 47:20.536
   DR. BUNNY: I trust you'll
      do the right thing.

47:20.538 --> 47:24.006
 DETECTIVE CROSS: Nerd, we are
 getting picked off like flies.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.075
     So I need you to stop
     being a little bitch,

47:26.077 --> 47:27.877
        or god help me,
       I'm going to spank

47:27.879 --> 47:30.847
your ass so hard you're going to
say, no, no, no, don't do that.

47:30.849 --> 47:34.450
    Don't speak my ass like
   that because it hurts me.

47:34.452 --> 47:36.385
      [suspenseful music]

47:39.023 --> 47:40.256
      - Detective Cross--
            - What?

47:40.258 --> 47:41.557
     DETECTIVE CROSS: Yes!

47:41.559 --> 47:43.860
DR. BUNNY: This is unbelievable!

47:43.862 --> 47:46.128
 I will not be a part of this!

47:46.130 --> 47:48.231
       Goddamn it, Hugh!

47:48.233 --> 47:49.232
          Bunny, wait!

47:49.234 --> 47:54.270
  That's Dr. Van Clit to you!

47:54.272 --> 47:56.505
     Doctor Bunny Van Clit!

47:56.507 --> 47:57.974
          [footsteps]

47:59.310 --> 48:02.245
        Bunny for short!

48:02.247 --> 48:05.381
      Dr. Bunny Van Clit!

48:05.383 --> 48:07.049
           Dr. Bunny!

48:07.051 --> 48:08.351
         Call me Bunny!

48:11.289 --> 48:13.322
           Van Clit!

48:13.324 --> 48:14.023
           All right.

48:14.025 --> 48:14.490
            [claps]

48:14.492 --> 48:15.391
              Yay!

48:15.393 --> 48:17.493
        Low down, buddy!
              Ah!

48:17.495 --> 48:18.494
           Too slow!
       [punches landing]

48:18.496 --> 48:19.362
             [thud]
           [gagging]

48:19.364 --> 48:20.263
          Let's do it!

48:20.265 --> 48:21.364
            Come on!
          - [gagging]

48:21.366 --> 48:23.065
DETECTIVE CROSS: Hugh, come on!

48:23.067 --> 48:25.034
         [wind blowing]

48:25.036 --> 48:26.969
      [suspenseful music]

48:39.317 --> 48:41.484
      HUGH: Dad, you sure
    you're fine being bait?

48:41.486 --> 48:43.619
      RICHARD: A man's got
       to have a purpose.

48:43.621 --> 48:46.155
 This is all I'm good for now.

48:46.157 --> 48:47.390
        [ripping noise]

48:47.392 --> 48:48.624
          Ah, damn it.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.359
           Leave it.

48:50.361 --> 48:52.228
            Ah, Dad.

48:52.230 --> 48:53.462
    You're going to go bald.

48:53.464 --> 48:55.264
      Richard, we're going
       to be hiding right

48:55.266 --> 48:56.632
   over there in that closet.

48:56.633 --> 48:57.999
     When he comes to kill
      you-- and he will--

48:58.002 --> 48:59.535
 we're going to be on his ass.

48:59.537 --> 49:02.371
    Look, I like the collar,
 but what's up with the straps?

49:02.373 --> 49:04.273
     JACE: Ran out of rope.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.475
  Well, why am I spread eagle?

49:06.477 --> 49:07.543
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
        How else are you

49:07.545 --> 49:09.378
  going to tie up a grown man?

49:09.380 --> 49:10.646
              Ah.

49:10.648 --> 49:11.981
  DETECTIVE CROSS: All right.

49:11.983 --> 49:13.649
   See you on the other side.

49:13.651 --> 49:14.617
             Hugh?

49:14.619 --> 49:15.484
          [footsteps]

49:16.421 --> 49:18.454
     Hugh, come over here.

49:21.693 --> 49:24.493
    I've been thinking a lot
    about mortality lately.

49:24.495 --> 49:27.363
       And my dear friend
       Yakazuki recently

49:27.365 --> 49:29.198
 lost his mother to a Godzilla.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.200
      And I know I haven't
      always been around.

49:31.202 --> 49:35.738
      And that's basically
   because, well, sometimes I

49:35.740 --> 49:37.540
 forgot who the hell you were.

49:37.542 --> 49:39.141
  Not just for a few minutes--

49:39.143 --> 49:40.376
       I'm talking weeks.

49:40.378 --> 49:42.178
       Just about all of
      1992, I thought you

49:42.180 --> 49:43.980
  were a friend your mother's.

49:43.982 --> 49:45.214
              Hm.

49:45.216 --> 49:48.718
        RICHARD: I'm not
    saying this right, son.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.187
      The world is cruel.

49:51.189 --> 49:54.523
  I thought if I'd made enough
 money, I could keep you safe.

49:54.525 --> 49:57.259
  But instead I made you soft.

49:57.261 --> 50:00.196
   Soon you're going to have
   to fend for yourself, son.

50:00.198 --> 50:04.367
  And, frankly, I don't think
   you'll be able to do that.

50:04.369 --> 50:06.268
        [dramatic music]

50:12.076 --> 50:14.110
        Prove me wrong.

50:14.112 --> 50:15.111
        Prove me wrong.

50:15.113 --> 50:16.112
       You're a Dangler.

50:16.114 --> 50:18.047
        [dramatic music]

50:20.051 --> 50:21.417
          [footsteps]

50:22.420 --> 50:25.654
           Good, kid.

50:25.656 --> 50:26.422
             Loser.

50:26.424 --> 50:29.425
         But good kid.

50:29.427 --> 50:30.526
        DR. BUNNY: There
        must be a supply

50:30.528 --> 50:32.028
 closet around here somewhere.

50:36.801 --> 50:37.767
          [door opens]

50:37.769 --> 50:38.768
            [squeak]

50:38.770 --> 50:40.669
        [dramatic music]

50:45.643 --> 50:46.575
         [door closes]

50:50.148 --> 50:51.113
         [tea pouring]

50:52.550 --> 50:55.051
     BABYSITTER: Dr. Bunny
   Van Clit, I was wondering

50:55.053 --> 50:57.053
     when you would arrive.

50:57.055 --> 50:59.121
      What is this place?

50:59.123 --> 51:00.523
              Tea?

51:00.525 --> 51:01.557
        DR. BUNNY: Yes.

51:01.559 --> 51:02.425
          [clattering]

51:03.361 --> 51:04.493
     BABYSITTER: I'm sorry.

51:04.495 --> 51:05.494
        You shouldn't be
       drinking in here.

51:05.496 --> 51:07.096
       This is a library.

51:07.098 --> 51:08.697
          Oh, my god.

51:08.699 --> 51:11.567
    You don't know, do you?

51:11.569 --> 51:14.537
         Jace is dead.

51:14.539 --> 51:16.405
    I'm sorry to hear that.

51:16.407 --> 51:17.840
    I always cared for him.

51:17.842 --> 51:19.842
     I hope he was able to
      at least find peace

51:19.844 --> 51:22.244
with who he was before he died.

51:22.246 --> 51:23.646
     You knew Jace was gay?

51:23.648 --> 51:25.581
         Jace was gay?

51:25.583 --> 51:28.651
     I just mean I hope his
     passing was peaceful,

51:28.653 --> 51:31.620
   like in his sleep, instead
 of, for example, being stabbed

51:31.622 --> 51:33.756
  in the bladder and bleeding
  out on a cold floor in front

51:33.758 --> 51:35.291
        of his friends.

51:35.293 --> 51:37.693
      Is this where you've
     been this whole time?

51:37.695 --> 51:39.728
         Au contraire.

51:39.730 --> 51:43.699
   I've been to the sands of
   the Sahara, the snowy peak

51:43.701 --> 51:50.506
of Kilimanjaro, and, for a brief
 spell, in a town under a dome.

51:50.508 --> 51:51.474
              How?

51:51.476 --> 51:53.776
   The power of imagination.

51:56.647 --> 52:02.518
   Inside these books, I can
 journey to any place or time,

52:02.520 --> 52:04.120
      without even taking
         a single step.

52:04.122 --> 52:05.788
        [dramatic music]

52:10.595 --> 52:12.695
     I've learned so much.

52:12.697 --> 52:18.134
     Did you know it can be
     both the best of times

52:18.136 --> 52:20.736
    and the worst of times?

52:20.738 --> 52:23.572
              Wow.

52:23.574 --> 52:26.142
       Hey, since you've
        learned so much,

52:26.144 --> 52:28.210
       maybe you can help
      us find the killer.

52:28.212 --> 52:30.679
        [sighs] This is
        not my purpose.

52:30.681 --> 52:34.617
     I've moved beyond this
  house and the petty affairs

52:34.619 --> 52:35.784
       of its occupants.

52:35.786 --> 52:37.386
         There must be
       something that you

52:37.388 --> 52:39.488
 can teach me that would help.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.757
       Maybe you learned
       about criminology

52:41.759 --> 52:43.926
    or some scientific test?

52:43.928 --> 52:46.228
      The only test I read
       about is something

52:46.230 --> 52:47.863
    called the Bechdel test.

52:47.865 --> 52:49.648
          What's that?

52:49.649 --> 52:51.432
BABYSITTER: It's just a test for
 whether or not a film contains

52:51.435 --> 52:53.469
       at least one scene
        where there are

52:53.470 --> 52:55.504
two female characters that have
 a conversation about something

52:55.506 --> 52:57.806
       other than a man.

52:57.808 --> 52:58.574
             And--

52:58.576 --> 52:59.475
         No, that's it.

52:59.477 --> 53:00.576
     Well, that's so easy.

53:00.578 --> 53:01.844
 They just need to have names.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.513
      For example, Doctor
      Bunny Van Clit and--

53:04.515 --> 53:06.182
        God, Babysitter!

53:06.184 --> 53:08.184
 I'm not sure if I can do this.

53:08.186 --> 53:10.486
       I feel like I have
      this responsibility

53:10.488 --> 53:11.787
   to keep these people safe.

53:11.789 --> 53:13.556
   But I just don't know how!

53:13.558 --> 53:16.458
     Trust your instincts.

53:16.460 --> 53:17.793
       Like the animals!

53:17.795 --> 53:18.961
         BABYSITTER: I
     believe the knowledge

53:18.963 --> 53:21.797
   you seek is in this room.

53:21.799 --> 53:23.532
           Teach me!

53:23.534 --> 53:24.700
           Guide me!

53:24.702 --> 53:27.703
       There is a section
         on forensics.

53:27.705 --> 53:29.872
      It's right this way.

53:29.874 --> 53:32.374
 DR. BUNNY: Thank you so much.

53:32.376 --> 53:33.409
  BABYSITTER: You're welcome.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.843
And please keep your voice down.

53:34.845 --> 53:36.278
       This is a library.

53:38.649 --> 53:40.449
      This is it, Dangler.

53:40.451 --> 53:41.517

       It's come to this.

      always gotten along,

      but I wanted to say
     I'm glad we're working

53:51.796 --> 53:55.464
 together to try to solve this.

53:55.466 --> 53:59.735
       I want you to know
      that before he died,

53:59.737 --> 54:02.371
        Jace said that I
      was his best friend.

54:02.373 --> 54:04.740
            Not you.

54:04.742 --> 54:08.277
  He wanted you to know that.

56:38.395 --> 56:39.628
       Jesus, I've got to
      tell you, I'm really

56:39.630 --> 56:40.513
 impressed with you right now.

56:40.514 --> 56:41.397
   I've got to tell you that.

56:41.399 --> 56:42.131
       [squelching noise]

56:42.133 --> 56:42.998
              OK.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.601
      [gasping] All right.

56:45.603 --> 56:48.404
   You got the gravy to stick
 that thing in me a third time?

56:48.406 --> 56:49.104
           Unlikely.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.072
        [knife stabbing]
              Oh!

56:52.777 --> 56:55.978
    [gagging] What is this?

56:55.980 --> 56:58.547
           My blood?

56:58.549 --> 56:59.081
         What is this?

56:59.083 --> 57:01.617
          Let me see.

57:01.619 --> 57:04.019
          White light?

57:04.021 --> 57:07.089
     What are these images
       flooding my mind?

57:07.091 --> 57:10.092
      Memories of my life?

57:10.094 --> 57:12.060
          Where am I?

57:12.062 --> 57:14.062
            Heaven?

57:14.064 --> 57:15.664
         [gasping] OK.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.633
          Who's that?

57:17.635 --> 57:19.034
         Is that Elvis?

57:19.036 --> 57:21.603
        [laughs] Elvis!

57:21.605 --> 57:22.971
        [chains rattle]

57:24.008 --> 57:30.746
     [sobs] Son of a bitch.

57:30.748 --> 57:37.019
    [sobs] [groans] [groans]

57:37.021 --> 57:43.058
       [thunder booming]

57:43.060 --> 57:44.226
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
      Very disappointing.

57:44.228 --> 57:45.761
           No pizza.
           No killer.

57:45.763 --> 57:47.529
   How do you catch a killer?

57:47.531 --> 57:48.931
         Ah, I got it.

57:48.933 --> 57:51.600
   To catch a killer, you got
    to think like a killer.

57:51.602 --> 57:53.001
         I got an idea.

57:53.003 --> 57:53.969
          [footsteps]

57:56.574 --> 57:58.540
   How long you been working
     for the pizza company?

57:58.542 --> 57:59.842
 You're pretty hot for a nerd.

57:59.844 --> 58:00.776
           Thank you.

58:03.481 --> 58:03.996

58:04.515 --> 58:05.514
       HUGH: Oh, my god!

58:05.516 --> 58:06.181
      What the fuck, man?

58:06.183 --> 58:06.849
              Oh!

58:06.851 --> 58:07.649
           [screams]

58:07.651 --> 58:08.650
         What the hell?

58:08.652 --> 58:09.685
   Here's what we've learned.

58:09.687 --> 58:10.819
Here's what we've learned, huh?

58:10.821 --> 58:11.954
         We are looking
       for a person who's

58:11.956 --> 58:13.222
        heart is beating
       like a jackhammer

58:13.224 --> 58:14.723
      and apparently feels
      more alive than he's

58:14.725 --> 58:15.958
  ever felt in his whole life.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.960
      [laughs] That's who
       we're looking for!

58:17.962 --> 58:18.861
             [thud]
            - Wait!

58:18.863 --> 58:19.962
             Wait!

58:19.964 --> 58:21.263
       Did you hear that?
          - Raccoons!

58:21.265 --> 58:22.264
      [suspenseful music]

58:22.266 --> 58:23.265
           HUGH: Dad!

58:23.267 --> 58:24.833
           [screams]

58:24.835 --> 58:26.235
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
        Don't look, kid!

58:26.237 --> 58:28.203
        Oh, don't look!

58:28.205 --> 58:29.771
         He got fisted!

58:29.773 --> 58:31.173
           I'm sorry.

58:31.175 --> 58:32.741
         I'm so sorry!

58:32.743 --> 58:34.109
             [sobs]

58:34.111 --> 58:35.644
        [dramatic music]

58:43.587 --> 58:44.920
       [squelching noise]

58:46.690 --> 58:51.560
  [sighs] At least we can all
  agree this wasn't my fault.

58:51.562 --> 58:53.228
  What are you talking about?

58:53.230 --> 58:54.162
       You left the room!

58:54.164 --> 58:55.197
       You set the trap!

58:55.199 --> 58:57.232
  Don't you think I know that?

58:57.234 --> 58:58.233
       I fucked up, Hugh!

58:58.235 --> 58:59.835
  I don't know what I'm doing!

58:59.837 --> 59:01.303
 These aren't even my clothes!

59:01.305 --> 59:04.172
        It is one thing
       to see your mother

59:04.174 --> 59:05.807
      and your best friend
       brutally murdered!

59:05.809 --> 59:08.911
       But it is another
      to see your mother,

59:08.913 --> 59:12.180
   your best friend, and your
   father brutally murdered.

59:12.182 --> 59:14.583
        All those women!

59:14.585 --> 59:16.618
 They just wanted sex from me!

59:16.620 --> 59:18.954
  They didn't even care about
     their missing jewelry!

59:18.956 --> 59:21.323
    I never made them proud!

59:21.325 --> 59:22.791
     I never made the team!

59:22.793 --> 59:25.127
  I never brought a girl home!

59:25.129 --> 59:28.630
All my little shoes are Velcro!

59:28.632 --> 59:29.798
         Hugh, no lie.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.834
      You seem smart, and
        cool, confident,

59:32.836 --> 59:34.603
   But I'm so scared of you.

59:34.605 --> 59:37.072
      I don't want to die.

59:37.074 --> 59:38.941
 I want to see anyone else die.

59:38.943 --> 59:41.143
     I'm just a little boy.

59:41.145 --> 59:45.981
   [gasping] I can't do this.

59:45.983 --> 59:48.016
        I can't be here!

59:48.018 --> 59:49.885
      Send me to my room.

59:49.887 --> 59:50.819
     Don't leave me, Hugh!

59:50.821 --> 59:52.087
      Send me to my room!

59:52.089 --> 59:53.622
         Don't leave me
       with these bodies!

59:53.624 --> 59:54.690
             Do it!

59:54.692 --> 59:56.291
        - Don't make me!
         - You have to!

59:56.293 --> 59:58.293
       - Go to your room!
          - I'm sorry!

59:58.295 --> 01:00:00.262
             Hugh!

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:03.265
              No!

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.834
       [screams] Oh, boy!
             [thud]

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:06.835
              Ah!

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:11.640
   [sobs] [gagging] Oh, shit!

    [screams] [sobs] Stupid!

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.915
          Stupid baby!

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:26.288
       [groans] [screams]
     [sobs] I need service!

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:33.228
      [sobs] [screams] Who
     are you kidding, Hugh?

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.832
   You'll never be a Jambow!

       [flames crackling]

01:00:57.755 --> 01:00:59.755
  DR. BUNNY: There's something
      I have to tell you!

          [footsteps]

        [hissing noise]

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.695
      Oh, Detective Cross?

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:09.831
     I don't know anymore.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.133
      DR. BUNNY: Where are
       Richard and Hugh?

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:12.834
     DETECTIVE CROSS: Dead.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.002
       They're all dead.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.971
            Oh, god!

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:16.738
         Both of them?

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.406
           Well, no.

01:01:17.408 --> 01:01:18.774
         Just Richard.

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.175
        But Hugh locked
      himself in his room

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:24.146
     and he won't even talk
    to me, his best friend.

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:26.181
       I know we haven't
    always seen eye to eye.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.949
        [hissing noise]

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:30.285
 In fact, we've basically hated
  each other from the get go.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.286
       I never hated you.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.455
       Well, I hated you.

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:35.991
        What I'm trying
       to say is, you've

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.759
   been a terrible detective.

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.094
   Why are you being so mean?

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:41.196
          Just listen.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:44.166
         You've been a
      terrible detective.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:45.967
I've been a terrible scientist.

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.870
       But I read a book.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.873
  And it taught me something.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.275
            Science!

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.111
     I think I can actually
   help us solve this thing.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:57.412
    But I can't do it alone.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:58.847
        DETECTIVE CROSS:
        So you're saying

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:01.483
       if you can become
      a better scientist,

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:03.719
       then I can become
       a better detect--

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.487
              No.

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.155
          No, no, I--

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.357
      I don't think-- no.

        [hissing noise]

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:12.961
       You know, there's
        really no reason

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:15.097
   you should still be alive.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.998
  Your instincts are way off.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.801
  You keep hurting the people
   you're trying to protect.

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:22.904
     But you're still here!

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.506
     That means something.

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.441
       You're a survivor.

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:28.043
       You're resilient.

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:28.777
         You're strong!

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:34.349
          I am strong.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:35.317
        DR. BUNNY: Yes.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.018
   But I meant in more of a--

01:02:40.106 --> 01:02:40.955
     You're the strong guy.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:42.290
      Knock yourself out.

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:54.236
      HUGH: I don't think
   there's one picture of me

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:55.470
      without Bunny ears.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:57.038

   JACE (ON VIDEOTAPE): Hey!

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.790
     What up, jive turkeys!

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:15.957
       It's [inaudible].

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.559
  I've got a jive turkey dog.

       Have a little fun!

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:23.865

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:26.067
         I love Nixon!

  DOUG (ON VIDEOTAPE): Strong!

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:32.474
      Just like the USSR!

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:35.143
       [laughs] Oh, yeah!
              Oh!

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.545
              Oh!
              Ah!

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:37.579
              Ah!

 HUGH (ON VIDEOTAPE): [gagging]

01:03:38.816 --> 01:03:39.881
RICHARD (ON VIDEOTAPE): It's OK.

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:40.916
            Come on.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.448
        Well, actually,
       I am very scared.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.184
       But I don't care.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:46.787
  I may always be a nerd, but
  I don't have to be a coward.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.723
   I'm not going to back down
   from what I know is right.

         DR. BUNNY: Oh!
        [dramatic music]

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:01.736
     DETECTIVE CROSS: Well,
     maybe she made it out.

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.786
       [squelching noise]

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.455
 DR. BUNNY: She wasn't a slut.

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:21.890
         She was smart.

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:23.658
         She was kind.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.426
    She was Phyllis Gorman.

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:27.295
       I'm going to smash
       the son of a bitch

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.363
who did this to Phyllis Gorman.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.432
     We need to take these
      bodies off the bed.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.466
             What?

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.269
 Guys, I need you to trust me.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:37.337
 I just wish you had said that
 before we added another body.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.640
             Fine.

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:41.442
      But only because I'm
       your best friend.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:42.810
              OK?

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:44.746
          - Yeah, man.
             - OK.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.281
        [dramatic music]

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.185
       HUGH: Oh, my god!

01:09:51.188 --> 01:09:53.287
   Uncle Doug is the killer!

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.322
 DR. BUNNY: That's impossible!

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:55.290
 HUGH: He faked his own death.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:55.957
            But how?

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:57.559
      He wasn't breathing!

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.827
    A lifetime of eating box
    underwater, that's how.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:00.828
      Why would he do it?

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:01.729
         I don't know.

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:02.730
     I guess girls like it?

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:03.798
       It freaks me out.
            - Yeah.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.799
              No!

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:06.367
  Why is he killing everyone?

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.670
       Oh, I don't know.

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:10.638
      But we need to find
    him before he finds us.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.973
      [suspenseful music]

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.445
        Great work, kid.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:18.513
      You've earned this.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:19.847
        [dramatic music]

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:28.656
    Well, it's a big house.

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:30.325
 How are we going to find him?

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.329
       Hydrogen peroxide!

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:35.597
        [dramatic music]

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.867
             Whoa!
         What the fuck?

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:41.736
      DR. BUNNY: Hydrogen
   peroxide reacts with blood

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.371
     in a really gross way.

01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:44.806
       But it led me out
        of the bathroom

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:46.908
        to a footprint I
       found in the hall.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.244
       In examining these
      footprints, I found

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:52.714
    various trace chemicals,
      notably alkali dust,

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:55.416
 typically found in HVAC units.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:56.718
        [dramatic music]

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:04.592
      Which tells me he's
      been using the vents

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:08.329
 and crawl spaces to get around
 the house to avoid being seen.

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:11.633
I also found residue from honey
 crest, a moss which only grows

01:11:11.635 --> 01:11:14.269
  on the west side of objects.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:15.770
              Hm.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.339
   DR. BUNNY: Because of the
  sun's angle of declination,

01:11:18.341 --> 01:11:19.774
        I knew that the
       residue had to be

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.843
   coming from the northwest
       wing of the house.

01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:23.411
  You boys ready to do plung--

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:24.978
  - Get the fuck out of here!
       - Get out of here!

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:26.181
         I'll stab ya!

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:27.382
      DR. BUNNY: We don't
        need a plumber!

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.683
     - We don't need that.
          - I'm sorry.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:29.784
          We're busy.
        HUGH: I'm sorry.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:30.918
  DETECTIVE CROSS: We're busy!
             [pop]

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.886
         DR. BUNNY: And
       the final chemical

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:32.687
   detected in the footprint?

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:35.790
          The C25H52.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:36.724
         What is that?

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.526
     DR. BUNNY: Candle wax.

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:42.030
The walk in closet has a window
 on the northwest corner, lots

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:44.832
    and lots of candles, and
     it also happens to be

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.035
 where all the vents converge.

01:11:47.037 --> 01:11:48.569
           HUGH: Wow.

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.872
     And you got that from
     just a few footprints.

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:52.940
    Science is pretty cool!

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:53.908
   You don't have to tell me!

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:54.809
            [laughs]

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.077
     So what do we do now?

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:57.745
          Now we wait.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:00.648
It could take days, months even.

01:12:01.384 --> 01:12:02.050

              Oh!

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.521
You people could have killed me!

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:07.622
     What's wrong with you?

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:09.557
    We know it's you, Doug!

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:11.826
 It's been you the whole time.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:12.660
             Yeah.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:13.928
         It's me, Doug.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.731
And it's been me the whole time!

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:17.465
       You were stabbed!

01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:18.499
              Yes!

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:21.502
 [laughs] Because I stabbed me!

         Stabbed by me!

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:24.806
     You'd be amazed at how
     durable the human body

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:26.674
  is when pushed to its limit.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.943
Especially when it gets you off.

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:31.346
    Why did you do it, Doug?

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:32.747
         We're family!

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:35.883
      Because I'm sick and
   tired of being a Dangler!

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:36.718
      Look at all of you!

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.019
             Look!

    innuendo, and your mood

   banter, and your foreplay!

    You people are all soft!

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.396
   You're soft to your cores!

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:48.863
          But not me.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.832
           I'm hard!

  and you're even sicker now!

           I'm sick?
         No, no, no no.
