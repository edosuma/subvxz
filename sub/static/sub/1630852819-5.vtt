‐Happy six months sober.

young Dan.
‐SAMANTHA: Is that

01:04.932 --> 01:07.134
the cake that's been in the
display case for four months?

01:07.134 --> 01:08.735
It is, which means
you've been sober longer than

01:08.735 --> 01:10.671
this cake has been alive.
How cool is that?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.506
Just bl‐blow out the candle.
It's symbolic.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.743
‐Yay.
‐Yes, all right.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.947
Well, thanks for inviting me
to whatever this was,

01:19.947 --> 01:22.115
but got to get this
back to the bakery

01:22.115 --> 01:23.450
before they realize
it's gone.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.786
‐Bye, Doris.
‐Okay.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.956
Great job.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.557
What's with the mood?
We throw you a surprise party,

01:30.557 --> 01:33.293
‐you can't
even muster a thank you?
‐Sorry, rough morning.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.262
Care to elaborate?

01:35.262 --> 01:36.630
Yeah, I'm not sure it's an
appropriate conversation

01:36.630 --> 01:38.799
‐to have with you.
‐Well, nothing's off‐limits.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.367
(clears throat)
Okay. I heard my Mom

01:40.367 --> 01:41.935
doing it with Bob this morning.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.171
They're still together.
Wow, good for Carol.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.739
That's not the point.
The point is I was jealous

01:45.739 --> 01:48.775
she was getting laid, okay?
If I don't see some action soon,

01:48.775 --> 01:51.745
this whole area's gonna
break off and drift out to sea.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.814
Six months sober
is when it happened for me, too.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.049
Your privates sacrificed
themselves to the tide?

01:56.049 --> 01:58.685
No, I started to feel
my body again.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.455
You're just emerging
from sobriety survival mode.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.489
In the beginning,
your body's like,

02:02.489 --> 02:03.657
"Don't drink. I want to drink.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.425
Don't drink. I want to drink."

02:05.425 --> 02:07.327
But you're not a walking
nervous system anymore,

02:07.327 --> 02:08.962
you've settled in
for the long haul,

02:08.962 --> 02:10.931
and all the normal feelings
are coming back, like...

02:10.931 --> 02:14.101
"I am craving
Flamin' Hot Cheetos" or

02:14.101 --> 02:15.469
"I'm horny as hell."

02:15.469 --> 02:16.770
I am horny as hell.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.405
‐(clears throat)
‐Yeah.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.906
I‐I don't... I don't know
if he wants to hear about it.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.643
Listen, I can't help you
find someone,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.778
but you're coming to
my sober dance party, right?

02:24.778 --> 02:26.913
I mean, dancing,
there's gonna be a deejay,

02:26.913 --> 02:29.583
you can burn off
some of that excess energy.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.318
Really appreciate
the invitation, but

02:31.318 --> 02:32.953
I'm trying to get laid.

02:32.953 --> 02:33.954
Well, historically, there's
been a lot of meet‐cutes

02:33.954 --> 02:36.690
at the Pellegrino table.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.158
Uh, you know what,
if it's okay with you,

02:38.158 --> 02:40.127
I think I'm gonna
shoot my shot elsewhere.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.361
‐Mm.
‐I've been laying
a lot of groundwork,

02:41.361 --> 02:42.796
I'm pretty sure
I can seal the deal.

02:42.796 --> 02:43.997
Wow. Confident.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.532
Oh, yeah. You should have
seen me back in the day,

02:45.532 --> 02:46.933
it was like...

02:49.636 --> 02:51.204
I was really good at it.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.806
I was.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.641
No, seriously.

02:54.641 --> 02:55.809
Oliv...

02:55.809 --> 02:57.678
So, how's‐how's work going?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.613
We have a IPO coming up.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.815
But we don't have
a money‐making strategy,

03:01.815 --> 03:04.818
so work's been a bit
of a shit show.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.486
But I have that...

03:06.486 --> 03:08.121
‐you know,
the sobriety app, right?
‐Oh, the app, yeah.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.557
Yeah. Showing a bit of interest
with investors

03:10.557 --> 03:12.492
and all that stuff,
so that's cool.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.960
If anything, I can use it
as a safety net, right?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.862
My ch‐my chest,
I don't think isn't supposed

03:15.862 --> 03:18.198
‐to feel like this.
Can we stop for a second?
‐Yeah. Sure, sure.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.766
Uh, let's go stretch
or something.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.735
‐Oh, it's nice to sit.
‐Yeah.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.575
You know, I, um,
I heard the other day

03:28.575 --> 03:30.877
that exercise
increases your libido.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.345
Isn't that weird?

03:32.345 --> 03:35.382
Sure. It's weird.
Where'd you hear that?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.852
Oh, this, like, new podcast
I've been listening to.

03:38.852 --> 03:39.986
Old Cosmos. Um...

03:41.021 --> 03:42.889
It's really hot out, isn't it?
Oh, my God.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.695
Hey, do you ever get, like...

03:48.695 --> 03:51.398
like, really sore right here?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.335
Yeah, yeah.
I have a stretch for that.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.337
‐Yeah?
‐Uh‐huh.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.538
‐You stand up?
‐Yeah.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.075
So... so, you just, like,
cross your legs.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.044
‐Yeah.
‐Right? Put your left leg
over here,

04:04.044 --> 04:05.679
and your right leg,
and then you just lean in...

04:06.913 --> 04:08.648
Whoa.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.584
"Whoa" good or "whoa" bad?
What is...

04:10.584 --> 04:12.686
Oh, it's... it's bad, isn't it?

04:12.686 --> 04:13.887
'cause you're kind of, like,

04:13.887 --> 04:15.222
standing way far away
from me now.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.691
Sam. Come on, we can't do this.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.692
I know it's a rule,
but it's not like

04:18.692 --> 04:20.761
it's enforceable by law, okay?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.396
You're too new. You know?

04:23.396 --> 04:24.831
We act on anything,
we can endanger

04:24.831 --> 04:26.566
your sobriety.
You only have six months.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.235
‐You know what?
‐Yeah?

04:28.235 --> 04:30.804
‐I can, like,
feel the rejection.
‐Mm.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.273
‐In my stomach. It hurts
really bad. No, I'm not okay.
‐You okay? You okay?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.975
Why did you let me go jogging

04:34.975 --> 04:36.777
so many times?
I'm not a jogger.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.378
I mean, I couldn't tell
that you weren't a jogger.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.880
I'm so sorry.

04:40.914 --> 04:44.384
Listen, we're on
different timelines, you know?

04:44.384 --> 04:45.585
If we were both
newcomers, then

04:45.585 --> 04:47.954
this would have wound up
very differently.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.756
Please don't do that.
Okay? Seriously?

04:49.756 --> 04:51.491
The, like, rejecting me

04:51.491 --> 04:52.759
and then saying maybe.
It...

04:52.759 --> 04:54.294
‐I don't like it.
It's not good.
‐Okay.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.930
Uh... you're right.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.032
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.467
Well, let me just
draw a hard line.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.935
‐We pals?
‐Shh.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.437
‐Yeah. Let's do it.
Got to walk the gra...
‐(groans)

05:04.437 --> 05:06.239
Okay, all right.
You're good. You're...

05:06.239 --> 05:08.608
Oh, forget that dude.
You know what?

05:08.608 --> 05:10.911
He's probably a serial killer.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.380
Not everyone who doesn't sleep
with me is a serial killer.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.614
Also, if he were
a serial killer I'm pretty sure

05:14.614 --> 05:16.783
he'd want to bang me first.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.251
Yeah, you're probably right.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.154
It's okay, though.
Hey, let me see your phone.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.356
Let's get on the apps.
We're getting you laid tonight.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.560
(sighs) Let me see
what we're working with here.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.634
Okay, so, clearly,
it's been a minute.

05:34.634 --> 05:37.537
I crush it on Tinder.
And in my experience,

05:37.537 --> 05:39.339
men like it when you say
you give free haircuts

05:39.339 --> 05:41.074
and you're not looking for
a father for your kid.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.577
Yeah, I don't think
those really apply to me.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.278
Right.
Well, what are you looking for?

05:45.278 --> 05:46.746
You still into guys and girls?

05:46.746 --> 05:48.582
Yeah, pretty much anybody.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.083
As long as they're not vegan.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.952
Oh.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.221
‐Who is this?
‐What? Let me see.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.356
(gasps softly)
No judgement.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.892
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.760
So I slept with some
really disgusting people.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.864
Hey, don't focus
on who was in your vag.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.367
Focus on who's gonna
be in your vag, right?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.302
All right, let's take
some new pics.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.837
‐Right now?
‐Mm‐hmm.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.175
Lose the sundae.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.344
Sit over there.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.812
Mm‐hmm.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.848
Legs up.
Like a little bunny.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.652
Okay.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.021
Hmm.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.890
Okay.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.425
Hold this. Pretend like
you're reading it.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.728
Or I could actually read it.
I know how to read.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.563
Oh, great. That'll make it look
much more natural.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.965
Okay, ready?
Here we go.

06:38.965 --> 06:42.068
Sober Sam.
On the prowl.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.003
‐Yes, baby.
‐(shutter clicking)

06:43.003 --> 06:44.170
Look at her.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.572
She's a real lady.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.974
She sits like a lady
and reads thick‐ass books.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.877
Yes.
Yes, my Jewish jaguar.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.747
MAN (over P. A.):
The next train to board will
be a high‐capacity train.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.682
‐Brit?
‐Oh, my God. Mrs. Fink.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.017
Carol. Hi.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.385
It feels like
it's been 50 years.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.287
‐Oh!
‐(chuckles)

07:00.287 --> 07:02.255
‐And you look so beautiful.
‐Oh.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.125
But a little tired.
Are you just getting off?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.727
I'm actually on my way in.
Uh, how are you?

07:07.727 --> 07:11.164
I'm good.
And, um, Samantha...

07:11.164 --> 07:13.400
‐is back.
‐Yeah, I know.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.502
‐That must be nice.
‐It is what it is.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.104
You must be getting so excited.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.441
‐For the wedding. It's, what,
just a few months away.
‐Oh. Oh, my God,

07:21.441 --> 07:24.544
yeah. Ah. We get so
bogged down with planning,

07:24.544 --> 07:26.913
sometimes I forget to get
excited, but we are.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.616
I'm so happy for you.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.285
That Joel is a lucky duck.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.355
You're a star,
always been a star.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.424
Thank you.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.793
Do you ever think...

07:39.793 --> 07:41.928
I probably shouldn't
say this, but...

07:43.029 --> 07:45.632
It's a little strange‐‐
the way you two met, right?

07:45.632 --> 07:49.269
‐What?
‐Don't get me wrong,
it's completely natural.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.739
You and Joel bonded
over the shared trauma

07:52.739 --> 07:54.307
of taking care of her.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.443
I'm... I know it's
uncomfortable that we're...

07:56.443 --> 07:59.679
‐we dated the same guy.
‐No. (short chuckle)

07:59.679 --> 08:01.982
No, I'm so happy for you two.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.718
No, Joel was not
the right person for Samantha.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.119
I never liked them together.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.655
‐Really?
‐Yes. Oh.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.890
You... you remember Sam
in high school.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.926
Of course.
You two were inseparable.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.461
And I remember thinking

08:14.461 --> 08:17.130
at the time,
"She needs a deep thinker."

08:17.130 --> 08:18.965
Someone who can engage with her,

08:18.965 --> 08:21.267
which is so not Joel.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.238
Because...

08:25.238 --> 08:28.975
Samantha was gonna stay
in New York after college,

08:28.975 --> 08:31.177
so she needed
to meet that person

08:31.177 --> 08:32.846
in New York.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.716
Uh, clearly, Joel has
a great head on his shoulders.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.151
WOMAN: (over P. A.):
Attention, passengers.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.753

indistinctly)

08:49.729 --> 08:51.765

‐Yeah, what's his name again?
‐Brian. I picked him out

08:53.767 --> 08:55.802
especially for you,
he's perfect.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.570
He's married to his job,
so he has no time

08:57.570 --> 09:00.040
for a relationship,
just the sexy fun times.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.675
Oh, and I saw a plant
in his pictures.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.811
Fiddle‐leaf fig.
The dream.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.946
Yeah, it might not have been
a good idea to put you

09:06.946 --> 09:11.051
‐in charge of my sex life.
‐Hey. You got this, all right?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.352
Just remember
to order something sexy.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.020
Well, it's a coffee shop, so...

09:14.020 --> 09:15.055
Whole milk cappuccino,
extra foam.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.189
It'll send the right message.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.260
Hey, don't over a macchiato.
That's butt stuff.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.928
BRIAN:
So, basically,

09:21.928 --> 09:24.197
I try to determine what
the stock market's gonna do

09:24.197 --> 09:26.900
tomorrow and the day after that,
and the day after that.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.901
That's why they call it futures.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.002
Ah. So you have, like,

09:29.002 --> 09:30.136
a crystal ball or something?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.972
Is that...
Oh, that was a joke, right?

09:32.972 --> 09:34.107
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.342
‐(laughs) I knew it.
‐(chuckles)

09:36.342 --> 09:37.877
Yeah.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.048
This place is nice.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.317
It is.
Yeah, yeah, it's‐it's good.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.319
Yeah, I assumed
you were a big coffee head

09:46.319 --> 09:47.587
since you wanted to meet
at a coffee shop.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.890
Oh. Yeah, no.
I'm, uh, I'm sober.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.292
Oh, wow.
Me too.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.427
I mean, not sober sober,
but, you know,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.496
I can't have more than three a
night since I turned 30, so...

09:59.132 --> 10:01.101
Hi.
Just wanted to let you know

10:01.101 --> 10:02.769

10:02.769 --> 10:05.238
‐Thank you.
‐Thanks.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.574
Oof. That flew by.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.042
‐It did, didn't it? Yeah.
‐Yeah.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.044

to your apartment?
‐What?

10:12.078 --> 10:14.614
Do you want to go back
to your apartment?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.917
Wow. Okay.
I mean, yeah. Yeah?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.053

10:22.789 --> 10:25.158
But, uh, yes.
I... Let's do it.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.260

trying to loosen up. Uh,

10:47.113 --> 10:48.815
I'm kind of a planner,
so when things

10:48.815 --> 10:51.551
happen unexpected, I get
a little, you know, nervous.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.488
‐Would you like some?
‐No, I'm...

10:55.488 --> 10:58.057

more matches.
‐No.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.767

mixed signals.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.876

12:31.718 --> 12:34.220

in a while.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.022
‐I do look kind of cute.
‐You look super cute.

12:36.022 --> 12:36.956

Hey, come here for a sec.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.498
‐Yeah.
‐So...

12:45.498 --> 12:48.434
‐I've been researching
some readings for the ceremony,
‐Mm.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.104
and I thought Sasha could do
this one from Le Petit Prince.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.039
In French or English.
Or both, if you want.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.040
Might be kind of fun
to do both.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.708
Yeah, I don't know.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.378
‐Y‐You don't like it?
‐Well, you know, it's just

12:58.378 --> 13:01.314
very first thought.
Um... basic.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.050
'Cause, you know, I've seen it
at, like, a gajillion weddings.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.918
Well, yeah,
'cause it's a classic.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.453
Well, it's a kid's book, Joel.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.590
Okay. I mean, it was
on, like, ten wedding websites

13:10.590 --> 13:12.959
as one of the best readings,
but fine,

13:12.959 --> 13:15.295
‐I guess.
‐Yeah, well, you're
kind of proving my point.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.997
And... I mean,

13:17.997 --> 13:20.600
when's the last time
you read a book?

13:20.600 --> 13:21.968
‐What?
‐I mean,

13:21.968 --> 13:23.870
when was the last time
you read a book?

13:23.870 --> 13:26.773
Look, I'm‐I'm just saying
maybe if you read more,

13:26.773 --> 13:28.775
you might have different ideas.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.410
Okay, I‐I read, Brit.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.979
I mean, maybe not books you can
quote from at weddings.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.114
‐That's not what I'm saying.
‐Well, then what are you saying?

13:35.114 --> 13:36.249

I see you coming home

my hand down there...

using a vibrator.
