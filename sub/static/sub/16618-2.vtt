No one there
to tell you what to do,

10:23.657 --> 10:25.423
No kids fighting all the time.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.658
Wait a minute.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.960
I can eat dinner
in any room of the house!

10:28.962 --> 10:31.496
And not the scary ones like
the basement and bart's bedroom.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.898
And I can drink at home!

10:33.900 --> 10:36.301
Whoa, whoa!
You're twisting my words there.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.803
That would be cheaper!
And I wouldn't have to drive!

10:38.805 --> 10:40.405
And you <i>are</i> kind of mean.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.474
No one calls me mean.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.944
Moe, you're
proving my point.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.413
Here we are talking, and
you pull a shotgun on me.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.982
But there's never
any bullets in this. Watch.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.019
Ha! Good gag, huh?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.855

11:53.880 --> 11:56.681
Oh, yes. That's hot.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.016
(handles creak)

11:58.018 --> 11:59.884
(laughs)
the perfect temperature.

12:01.687 --> 12:02.987
(owl hooting)

12:02.989 --> 12:07.092
Ah, snoopy knew what
he was doing, all right.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.927
Woman: How you doing?
Aah!

12:08.929 --> 12:10.528
Don't worry, I've
seen you naked

12:10.530 --> 12:11.996
Plenty of times.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.498
I live in the house
behind yours.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.501
I don't think my wife
would like this.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.370
Hey, I got a boyfriend,
and you're not my type.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.039
Flanders:
Could you both keep it down?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.373
I'm trying
to count pennies.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.576
(scoffs) stupid flanders.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.512
Flanders:
Oh! You made me lose count.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.581
(both laughing)

12:29.583 --> 12:31.549
Homer, it looks like
you're out of beer, pal.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.617
(grunts)

12:33.552 --> 12:35.920
Wow, can a man just be friends

12:35.922 --> 12:37.088
With a woman?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.223
Here are some pretzels.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.424
Yes, he can!

12:44.964 --> 12:46.464
(fence squeaks)

12:46.466 --> 12:48.666
Aw, don't worry.
I'll fix that.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.970
Have one.
I'm celebrating.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.371
My boyfriend proposed.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.106
Wow! You'll get to enjoy

12:55.108 --> 12:57.575
The most magical part
of married life:

12:57.577 --> 12:58.877
The beginning.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.880
Mmm...
(slurping)

13:01.882 --> 13:03.948
So, uh, where's
the lucky guy?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.617
(sighs)
gone for the weekend.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.785
He's an airline pilot.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.553
Maybe he and I can
go out for beers

13:08.555 --> 13:10.255
Before a flight.
Mm.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.756
Where's your wife?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.925
Uh, she's staying at
this billionaire's house,

13:13.927 --> 13:15.894
Working as
a virtual reality actress.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.028
You know, the usual.

13:17.997 --> 13:19.230
Oh, homer?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.965
Something's going on
with homer.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.001
My spousal sense is tingling.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.737
Mom, you blew the take!

13:25.739 --> 13:27.839
Okay, that's it.
I'll direct.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.641
And I'll show you
how a pro does it.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.643
You, daughter character,
say you love me.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.644
(flatly):
I love you.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.778
Like you mean it.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.413
(flatly):
I really love you.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.748
Once more, with feeling.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.284
(flatly):
I... Really...

13:39.286 --> 13:42.020
Love... You.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.021
Blech.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.123
This girl has
no chops whatsoever.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.125
(a la katherine hepburn):
The existence of my <i>chops</i>

13:47.127 --> 13:49.694
Is not for the likes
of   <i>yo</i>to ascertain,

13:49.696 --> 13:50.829
My good sir.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.831
(shudders)
would you like some eggs

13:52.833 --> 13:54.365
With that ham?

13:56.635 --> 13:58.169
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.338
Looks like the old
make-out king's

14:00.340 --> 14:02.440
Got a new queen, huh?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.342
Guys, we're just friends.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.110
It's purely catatonic.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.345
"platonic."

14:07.347 --> 14:09.280
That means
she's into me,

14:09.282 --> 14:10.882
But I'm
keeping it cool.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.885
I like you, but that's
not what it means.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.486
Sure, right.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.856
(italian accent):
Here you go, the antipasto,

14:17.858 --> 14:19.290
To   <i>share.</i>

14:19.292 --> 14:21.860
Both:
Ooh...!

14:21.862 --> 14:23.795
Would you fellas like
to join us?

14:23.797 --> 14:25.897
(nervous stammers)

14:25.899 --> 14:27.866
(sophisticated accent):
When did salad get so awful?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.868
(sophisticated accent):
Kale ruined everything.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.036
(mock sophisticated laughter)

14:32.038 --> 14:33.838
(normal voice):
You're just like a guy.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.974
You're funny,
you like to eat crap.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.709
If I may get personal,

14:37.711 --> 14:40.011
What's your
bowling average?
212.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.714
Oh, my god, you're
my best friend!

14:42.716 --> 14:44.015
And that's all.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.183
Just friends.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.584
Eh, we shall see.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.386
There is one test
for a-romance

14:48.388 --> 14:50.388
That never fails.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.423
Enjoy it.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.198
That is not a-love!

15:00.200 --> 15:02.400
This is the best--
we're friends,

15:02.402 --> 15:04.202
No one has any reason
to get upset,

15:04.204 --> 15:05.904
And no one gets hurt.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.372
To no one getting hurt.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.606
Smithers:
<i>Smash-cut to marge!</i>

15:08.608 --> 15:11.442
"look, monty, our daughter,
the president,

15:11.444 --> 15:13.011
Is delivering her speech."

15:13.013 --> 15:16.414
Excuse me,
do I ever get a joke?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.582
Keep rolling.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.518
"mr. Vice president,
madam speaker,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.287
"chinese overlords,

15:22.289 --> 15:25.623
Years ago, our forefathers,
and <i>foremothers..."</i>

15:25.625 --> 15:27.025
Burns:
Stick to the script!

15:27.027 --> 15:28.626
Oh, you try to
give direction

15:28.628 --> 15:29.794
To a bunch
of land apes

15:29.796 --> 15:32.297
Who aren't worth
the ping-pong balls

15:32.299 --> 15:34.699
Stuck to their
untalented asses!

15:34.701 --> 15:36.467
Idiots!
Mountebanks!

15:36.469 --> 15:38.369
Featherwits!
Poltroons!

15:38.371 --> 15:39.604
(furniture crashes)

15:39.606 --> 15:43.541
Saint francis himself
would vomit with rage!

15:43.543 --> 15:45.143
Okay, you heard him,
people.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.078
That was great,
just a little more energy.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.047
Sir, I know you're
getting frustrated,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.582
So we recorded some
future scenarios.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.886
Yes, let's see what life
will be like when I'm old.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.955
I'm going to build homes
for the homeless

15:56.957 --> 15:58.890
With my boyfriend sean,

15:58.892 --> 16:01.492
Then it's off to vassar
in the fall.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.928
<i>Irish</i> boyfriend?
<i>Helping</i> the homeless?

16:03.930 --> 16:06.597
Well, every family has
one black sheep.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.932
Let's move on.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.168
How did this happen?
(pacifier pops twice)

16:10.170 --> 16:12.537
Don't you take
that tone with me.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.573
A harvard man?

16:15.575 --> 16:17.108
I was warned
there'd be nausea.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.978
I don't need them.
My life is perfect.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.350
My life is perfect.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.820
49, 50.
My life is perfect!

16:28.822 --> 16:31.656
Have you seen my
canadian penny?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.191
Oh, darn it,
darn it, darn it!

16:34.994 --> 16:37.095
Everyone out!
You're all fired!

16:37.097 --> 16:39.297
Having a family is the most
meaningless experience

16:39.299 --> 16:40.865
I could imagine.

16:40.867 --> 16:41.966
Try acting.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.201
Mm...

16:43.203 --> 16:44.268
Come on, kids.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.770
I'm taking
my bathrobe.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.105
There's a dye pack
stitched in.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.272
(loud pop)

16:48.274 --> 16:50.208
Joke's on you.
I like this better.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.010
Oh, go ahead,
take your robe.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.878
But you'll never work
in single-viewer

16:53.880 --> 16:56.914
Virtual reality
family melodrama again.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.450
Did you see
the guitar lessons sign

16:59.452 --> 17:00.818
On the telephone pole?

17:00.820 --> 17:01.986
I took a tab.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.022
No, I'm not
gonna take the lessons,

17:04.024 --> 17:06.190
I just needed
to blow my nose.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.559
Ooh, my family's here.
Gotta go.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.361
Hey, guys!
It's good to see you.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.363
Hmm. Good to see you.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.831
Who were you talking to?

17:13.833 --> 17:14.866
My friend julia.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.168
<i>Julia?</i> Like a girl?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.569
She's not a girl.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.505
She's three years younger
than your mother.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.639
(irritated murmur)

17:21.641 --> 17:23.207
Now, marge,
it's cool.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.809
All we do is share

17:24.811 --> 17:26.811
Our deepest thoughts
and feelings.

17:26.813 --> 17:27.879
Mm-hmm.

17:27.881 --> 17:31.082
Kids, could you
leave the room, please?

17:31.084 --> 17:33.918
Faster!

17:33.920 --> 17:34.986
Geronimo!

17:34.988 --> 17:35.887
(retreating footsteps)

17:35.889 --> 17:37.855
Marge, it's nothing.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.824
She's just
my new best friend.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.493
(groans angrily)

17:42.495 --> 17:43.728
What the-- why--

17:43.730 --> 17:45.329
Why are you mad
at those eggs?!

17:45.331 --> 17:47.265
They didn't do anything!

17:47.267 --> 17:48.766
Homer simpson!

17:48.768 --> 17:51.002
(whimpering)

17:51.004 --> 17:53.371
After all I've put up with
for all these years,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.773
If I'm not
your best friend,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.775
What is this marriage about?!

17:57.777 --> 17:59.544
Okay, okay, you're
my best friend.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.913
She's just somebody I call
when I'm mad at you.

18:02.881 --> 18:03.915
(screams)
(grumbling)

18:03.917 --> 18:05.383
I mean, I'm never
mad at you.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.951
Well, sometimes
I'm mad at you.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.953
A little bit!
But I shouldn't call her.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.789
I should just
drink it off at moe's.
(growling)

18:11.791 --> 18:14.525
You'll never hear
the name julia again.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.028
Hi, I'm julia.
Neh!

18:17.030 --> 18:18.763
I just wanted
to introduce myself

18:18.765 --> 18:20.965
And tell you you've got
a great husband.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.900
I've got a nice
bicycle, too,

18:22.902 --> 18:24.635
But I keep a lock on it.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.439
I have no interest
in... <i>Riding</i> your bike.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.075
But I want you to know
that your bike loves you

18:31.077 --> 18:33.611
As truly as a bike can.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.981
And, marge, <i>I</i> love you
as much as that bike.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.583
You <i>are</i> the bike.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.017
(gasps) wha...?!

18:42.321 --> 18:43.788
(door creaks)

18:43.790 --> 18:45.823
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.392
Apparently, you didn't
do anything wrong.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.895
But I'm not wrong for
getting mad at you either.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.065
Marge, julia taught me lots
of stuff that could help us.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.434
For example, I realize
that when you see me

18:56.436 --> 18:57.935
Doing something stupid
and you don't

18:57.937 --> 19:00.571
Say anything about it,
you    know,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.173
And you're just
being nice.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.341
That's true.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.977
And when something's
bothering you,

19:05.979 --> 19:10.248
Sometimes I should just say,
"I understand,"

19:10.250 --> 19:11.983
Instead of trying
to fix it.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.351
Because all you
really need is

19:13.353 --> 19:16.787
Someone to know
what you're feeling.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.423
That is really,
really lovely.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.492
(both moaning)

19:22.694 --> 19:25.296
I have to confess, I did
see him naked on the roof.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.499
I did, too,
and I was at 10,000 feet.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.836
Now for the final fantasy.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.938
(crying)

19:33.940 --> 19:37.008
(gasps)
oh, my love, my love,

19:37.010 --> 19:41.045
Losing you so young,
so beautiful.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.880
Still no jokes.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.986
(flatly):
I love you, and how.

19:48.988 --> 19:52.290
(sobs) you're too
good for heaven, man.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.759
(chuckles)
excellent.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.564
(creatures squawking)

19:59.566 --> 20:01.032
(eerie shriek)

20:02.301 --> 20:03.901
Welcome, monty.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.637
I'd like to take
a selfie with you.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.208
All right, but just one.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.909
Hmm, it's not
plugged in.
