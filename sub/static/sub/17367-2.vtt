WEBVTT

00:11.080 --> 00:14.084
Tonight, a sausage gets burnt,

00:14.119 --> 00:17.965
a sheep falls over,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.040
and our track is all wet.

00:27.024 --> 00:29.053
CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUDS

00:29.088 --> 00:33.072
Hello! Hello, everybody. Hello.

00:33.107 --> 00:37.021
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:37.056 --> 00:40.570
Now, you may remember, a couple
of years ago, we were contacted

00:40.605 --> 00:44.049
by a German car programme,
asking us to boost their ratings.

00:44.084 --> 00:47.092
You mean "take us on in a series
of motoring-related challenges".

00:47.127 --> 00:51.013
Yes, that. Anyway, we
did what he just said,

00:51.048 --> 00:57.036
and we didn't just beat them - with a
little bit of cheating, we humiliated them.

00:57.071 --> 00:59.977
Yeah, but despite the
futility of taking us on,

01:00.012 --> 01:04.013
we've now had a letter from the
people who make Top Gear in Australia.

01:04.048 --> 01:08.060
It's basically the same programmeas ours
but with silly accents. Yeah. I've got the
letter here.

01:08.095 --> 01:13.016
It says, "Dear Top Gear UK, we're coming...
" Why am I doing this in a French accent?

01:13.051 --> 01:18.057
"Dear Top Gear UK, we're coming
over to your stupid country soon,

01:18.092 --> 01:23.064
"and we want to take you on in a
car-based Ashes, you Pommie bas... "

01:24.056 --> 01:29.070
Ahem! Obviously, we picked up their
gauntlet, so welcome, everybody,

01:29.105 --> 01:34.084
to Top Gear versus Australia Motoring
Jeux Sans Frontieres - Ashes.

01:34.119 --> 01:38.969
"Land of Hope and Glory"

01:39.004 --> 01:42.004
These are the cars we can call on -

01:43.060 --> 01:49.000
the Aston Martin
DBS, the Jaguar XKR,

01:49.035 --> 01:51.072
the Caterham Superlight,

01:51.107 --> 01:53.041
the Aerial Atom,

01:53.076 --> 01:57.072
the Bentley Continental,
the Range Rooney.

01:57.107 --> 02:00.093
The list goes on and on.

02:00.128 --> 02:03.045
"Waltzing Matilda"

02:03.080 --> 02:08.027
And these are the
cars they can field -

02:08.062 --> 02:09.989
the Holden Maloo pickup,

02:10.024 --> 02:12.076
the Holden Commodore saloon...

02:12.111 --> 02:14.028
And that's it.

02:19.024 --> 02:23.020
So, we've got the cars, we've
got the place. Where are they?

02:23.055 --> 02:26.016
Should have landed
over three hours ago.

02:30.004 --> 02:33.020
You did book them a
taxi, didn't you?

02:33.055 --> 02:35.004
Sort of.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.060 --> 02:51.004
I just thought it would be nice for them to
arrive back in the country the way their
ancestors left.

02:51.039 --> 02:53.008
There's a pleasing circularity to it.
Exactly. That is thoughtful.

02:53.043 --> 02:54.064
That is very thoughtful.

02:54.099 --> 02:56.021
No, it is.

02:56.056 --> 03:00.036
So, let's meet the men
we'd be up against.

03:00.071 --> 03:04.016
Guys! Ewen Page, who
does not have a beard...

03:04.051 --> 03:07.069
.. Steve Pizzati, who does...

03:07.104 --> 03:10.053
.. and Shane Jacobson, who is fat.

03:10.088 --> 03:16.016
Strangely, none of them was very
happy about the prison lorry.

03:16.051 --> 03:17.989
That gag was not funny in 1938.

03:18.024 --> 03:23.076
It is here. You've had about 200years to
come up with a better gag,and that's it.
It's funny!

03:23.111 --> 03:26.981
I want to apologise for cubicle one.
You ran out of paper.

03:27.016 --> 03:32.016
To try and stop them whingeing, we
let them choose the first event.

03:32.051 --> 03:34.545
OK, working man's
one-kilometre drag race.

03:34.580 --> 03:37.005
We'll pit a typical
Aussie commercial vehicle

03:37.040 --> 03:42.076
against a typical Pommie commercialvehicle
to see which is the fastest. Drag race, eh?

03:42.111 --> 03:45.981
Yeah, what do you say? OK,

03:46.016 --> 03:50.037
it's "a working man's
one-kilometre drag race".

03:50.072 --> 03:54.056
This was a cunning move by
the Aussies, because it meant

03:54.091 --> 03:58.040
they could go straight in to
bat with the Maloo pickup.

03:58.075 --> 03:59.977
See that there?

04:00.012 --> 04:03.045
A six-litre V8. 380 horsepower.

04:03.080 --> 04:08.048
In America, they use the engine out
of this in the Corvette. Ah, yeah.

04:08.083 --> 04:13.048
Sadly, we hadn't thought to
bring a commercial vehicle.

04:15.072 --> 04:18.009
The bloke who just came and
painted my house did have a Jag.

04:18.043 --> 04:21.981
Is that any good? It doesn't make it
a commercial vehicle. Not really, no.

04:22.016 --> 04:26.064
I don't think we can really get away with
any of these as... They're justgoing to say
that we're cheating.

04:28.020 --> 04:32.546
Luckily, Jeremy then remembered
he had a mate with a Transit,

04:32.581 --> 04:37.072
so it was brought over, and a
pessimistic Hammond climbed aboard.

04:37.107 --> 04:40.589
This is not a good start for us.

04:40.624 --> 04:43.346
This exhaust is blowing badly.

04:43.381 --> 04:46.033
That really suits you, that.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.061
I can't imagine you in
anything else, Bruce.

04:48.096 --> 04:52.080
It is just Bruce in a Brucemobile.
And look at Nigel over there.

04:52.115 --> 04:56.064
Can we just stand back? Because
this is, I'm afraid, going to be...

04:56.099 --> 05:00.051
.. a bloodbath. It is.
A bloodbath. Exactly.

05:00.086 --> 05:04.004
Are you still sureyou
want to do this? Yes! Yes!

05:07.024 --> 05:08.977
Why do I have to
do the first event?

05:09.012 --> 05:10.985
And why does it have
to be in an old van?

05:11.020 --> 05:15.072
All I've got to do is watch that
little green light and then win.

05:15.076 --> 05:19.000
ENGINES REV

05:29.040 --> 05:30.096
Whoa!

05:35.000 --> 05:36.084
What the hell is in that van?

05:40.084 --> 05:42.072
What is this thing? It's insane!

05:53.072 --> 05:55.092
He's in the weeds! He's blown away!

05:58.060 --> 06:01.074
Yes! Yes, a clear
win for the Nigels.

06:01.109 --> 06:04.088
I'm sorry, Bruce, we take that one.

06:04.123 --> 06:07.045
First blood to Nigel.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.560
Sorry, Bruce. Yeah, we forgot
about the traditional gesture.

06:10.595 --> 06:14.005
That's not a van. It is a van!
It doesn't seem like a van.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.052
It is a van. Did you see the look
on Nigel's face when it took off?

06:18.087 --> 06:20.057
They don't believe it's a van!

06:20.092 --> 06:24.024
Pretty impressive. I like your van.
And they're all like that. That's standard.

06:24.059 --> 06:28.539
Look, I will prove to you thatit is a van.
Behold. What is that?

06:28.574 --> 06:33.020
It even managed to beat you while
carrying an engine in the back.

06:33.055 --> 06:34.571
Ready? Hang on.

06:34.606 --> 06:36.053
It says "Jaguar"!

06:36.088 --> 06:38.566
All right, this might be a bit...

06:38.601 --> 06:41.009
Yes. And it's turbocharged, too!

06:41.044 --> 06:47.060
It is slightly turbocharged. Actually, what
it is, if I'm honest, it's a Jaguar XJ220.

06:47.095 --> 06:51.032
Ohhh! Did you say we weren't allowed
to bring a Jaguar-propelled van?

06:51.067 --> 06:54.545
Well, no. Is it a van?
Is a van a commercial vehicle?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.024
You could have warned me.
I got the shock of my life!

06:58.059 --> 07:01.016
Honest to God!

07:04.016 --> 07:08.060
After our first-innings victory, Jeremy
decided that for the second challenge,

07:08.095 --> 07:13.008
we should re-run a race we'd
first tried against the Germans.

07:13.043 --> 07:15.061
OK, guys, it is really
straightforward, OK?

07:15.096 --> 07:20.001
The car on the bottom has the
accelerator, the gears and brake,

07:20.036 --> 07:25.088
but no steering wheel, because the
steering is done by the car on the top.

07:25.123 --> 07:27.021
You got that?

07:27.056 --> 07:29.068
Right. You got it, then, Bruce?

07:29.103 --> 07:31.085
Which one's ours, Nigel?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.068
These are both ours. OK?

07:33.103 --> 07:35.051
We have both these.

07:35.086 --> 07:36.965
Yours are over here.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.977
But... But what? It's upside down!

07:39.012 --> 07:44.068
Yes, but it won't be when you get home and
you watch it on TV there. It'll all be the
right way up.

07:44.103 --> 07:48.021
We are racing against
the Flat Earth Society.

07:48.056 --> 07:51.005
Do you feel kind of light-headed
now, being the right way up?

07:51.040 --> 07:55.052
A lot of blood in your feet. I feel cheated.
I feellike someone's going to vomit.

07:55.087 --> 07:58.060
You always think that they're
happy-go-lucky, the Australians.

07:58.095 --> 08:01.009
It's just solid whingeing.
We were until we got here.

08:01.044 --> 08:05.536
Sensitive, flighty, "Oh, no, I don't
want to go upside down in a racing car.

08:05.571 --> 08:10.028
"I'll die with sick in my helmet.
" What's your problem? You've one here,

08:10.063 --> 08:12.057
and you've got the other
two Toyotas over there.

08:12.092 --> 08:16.064
Well, hang on, that's four seats.
There's only three of us.

08:16.099 --> 08:18.973
Yes. We are in the same boat.

08:19.008 --> 08:21.013
Obviously, we need four
people, so we've got...

08:21.048 --> 08:24.032
Well, there's no other way of putting this.
We've got Jodie Kidd.

08:27.024 --> 08:31.020
Yeah. Good for you. So, who've wegot?
Elle MacPherson. No. Kylie. No.

08:31.055 --> 08:34.044
Dannii. No.
You've got Darren Lyons.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.033
Right. What's his name again?

08:39.068 --> 08:44.080
Darren Lyons. He's the ultimate
paparazzi photographer.

08:44.115 --> 08:47.087
So he's famous here? Very.

08:47.122 --> 08:50.060
And look at his hair. We are.

08:52.080 --> 08:56.068
It was time to saddle up.
We should talk tactics.

08:56.103 --> 09:00.056
What are the tactics?
Well, beat the Australians. OK.

09:00.091 --> 09:03.569
What are you talking about
down there? Tactics.

09:03.604 --> 09:07.013
Tactics! You're going
to have to really shout.

09:07.048 --> 09:10.076
I can't hear you. It's all
right, he doesn't mind shouting.

09:10.111 --> 09:13.021
Hammond? Yes?

09:13.056 --> 09:14.985
One bang for faster,
two for slower.

09:15.020 --> 09:19.004
Well, what if you bang for faster twice?
That's like slower.

09:19.039 --> 09:21.041
I'll leave a pause.

09:21.076 --> 09:24.004
Hey, look, they're being
lowered in, everybody.

09:31.008 --> 09:33.037
I hope he doesn't vomit.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.021
If he vomits, I'm going to vomit.

09:35.056 --> 09:41.092
With the Aussies the right way
up, we were ready to begin.

09:41.127 --> 09:43.969
What's the start? The klaxon thing?

09:44.004 --> 09:47.048
KLAXON BLARES Oh, we're off!
Go, go, go!

09:49.084 --> 09:52.032
Go on, Jez! Jesus!

09:54.024 --> 09:57.008
Yes! Oh, see the power!

09:57.043 --> 09:59.005
BLEEP!Go!

09:59.040 --> 10:01.017
Already! Oh...

10:01.052 --> 10:03.060
Oh, God, we're going to die.

10:06.036 --> 10:08.981
Yee-ha! Jodie, you're a star!

10:09.016 --> 10:15.068
At the back, Hammond and May werehaving
communication problems. Get them on the
inside, Hammond. Inside!

10:15.103 --> 10:19.052
Going round the outside. Keep going,
steady away! Keeping my foot down...

10:21.024 --> 10:23.973
Come on! Get out of the way!

10:24.008 --> 10:27.040
Quite quickly, my colleagues
overtook the Aussies...

10:27.075 --> 10:29.053
Here we go, here we go.

10:29.088 --> 10:33.080
.. mainly because they were
still whingeing. Oh, God!

10:33.115 --> 10:35.057
Where are we? I can't see!

10:35.092 --> 10:40.056
I have no reference! And the
pap was plainly a bit nervous.

10:40.091 --> 10:43.060
It's unbelievable!
I've got no hands!

10:47.088 --> 10:50.037
Tell him to shut up and drive!

10:50.072 --> 10:55.096
BLEEP! At this stage, it looked like
it was going to be a Brit one-two.

10:55.131 --> 10:57.049
But then...

10:57.084 --> 11:01.061
Hammond! Yes! Yes!

11:01.096 --> 11:08.016
Ha! Whoa! This is civil war breakingout,
right here, right now. Get in!

11:11.032 --> 11:13.045
That's a disaster.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.061
While we were bickering...
Go! You've broken my window!

11:17.096 --> 11:24.036
.. the Aussies caught up and engaged
us in a good-natured four-way duel.

11:24.071 --> 11:26.008
Catch that Pommie bastard!

11:28.000 --> 11:32.068
We've got them, we've got them, we've got
them, we've got them, we've got them! Oh,
no!

11:36.004 --> 11:40.064
Even Darren got the bit between histeeth.
Come on, move! Out of my way!

11:43.080 --> 11:47.057
This is Aussie driving!
Darren, slow down!

11:47.092 --> 11:52.000
You're not a racing driver, you'rea
photographer! This is great!

11:52.035 --> 11:54.044
No! An Australian's come through!

11:54.079 --> 11:57.024
We're in the lead!

11:57.059 --> 11:58.049
No!

11:58.084 --> 12:01.969
That's a big one.

12:02.004 --> 12:05.072
'By working together, we
eventually pulled out a lead.

12:05.107 --> 12:09.044
'But soon, Jeremy got bored. '

12:09.079 --> 12:11.068
Jodie, get his back wing.

12:16.004 --> 12:21.000
No, we've stalled! Sorry, James, I
might have done that on purpose.

12:21.035 --> 12:22.989
Come on, go, go, go! Go!

12:23.024 --> 12:28.012
This made James and Richard very
angry, and so, on the last lap,

12:28.047 --> 12:30.571
they exacted their revenge.

12:30.606 --> 12:33.096
Oh, no! Oh, you stupid fool!

12:33.131 --> 12:35.061
Good work, Hammond!

12:35.096 --> 12:37.552
Right, we're in the lead!

12:37.587 --> 12:39.793
We are so in the lead now!

12:39.828 --> 12:42.000
This is ours for the winning!

12:44.084 --> 12:46.033
Oh, they've won.

12:46.068 --> 12:49.072
They've won, they've won.
Not good, not good.

12:49.107 --> 12:52.041
With another victory in the bag,

12:52.076 --> 12:56.012
things were looking
good for Top Gear UK.

13:06.020 --> 13:11.045
You know what? It was turning out to be
like the real Ashes - complete whitewash.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.985
For a sporting nation, they're quitebad at
sport, aren't they? It was quite
embarrassing.

13:16.020 --> 13:21.052
It's like having a competition to see which
country's best at invading Poland, and
Germany coming last.

13:21.087 --> 13:25.008
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on,
because first of all, let's do the news.

13:25.043 --> 13:26.981
Yes, and first of all, last week,

13:27.016 --> 13:33.024
we featured a motorcycle - a BMW, if I'm
not mistaken - a BMW, in your Aerial Atom
film,

13:33.059 --> 13:39.032
and we've had a number of complaints that
we didn't give enough information about it.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.001
So, James, would you
like to address that?

13:41.036 --> 13:45.056
Yes, indeed, bikers, it has a
cable-operated anti-hopping clutch.

13:45.091 --> 13:48.017
Lovely. Thank you very much.

13:48.052 --> 13:51.044
There's a new Mini out, OK?
There's a picture of it here.

13:51.079 --> 13:54.024
It's called the Countryman.

13:54.059 --> 13:57.001
It's not a funny name!

13:57.036 --> 14:02.016
This is the biggest car in the world, OK?
You might think this is a stubble field. It
isn't.

14:02.051 --> 14:05.049
It's the Brazilian rainforest.
These are trees, in fact, here.

14:05.084 --> 14:08.013
So that's a Mini in the same way
that you are a midget. Exactly.

14:08.048 --> 14:13.526
You might think, "Well, I fancy a Mini. I
like the idea of a Mini. But I want more
space!"

14:13.561 --> 14:18.969
But the ridiculous thing is... Well, the
one I drove the other day only had four
seats.

14:19.004 --> 14:24.032
You're right - you'd think there'd be a
middle one in the back, but there's a sort
of "styling feature".

14:24.067 --> 14:27.080
We've got a picture of it.
There's just two bars that run... Look.

14:27.115 --> 14:31.041
What's the point of that?
It is a civic sculpture.

14:31.076 --> 14:34.021
It's like trading up from a three-
to a four-bedroom house

14:34.056 --> 14:38.036
and filling the fourth bedroom with
a waterfall. Why would you do that?

14:38.071 --> 14:40.096
It's just stupid. It's the
stupidest car I've ever seen.

14:40.131 --> 14:43.068
And it gave me crabs.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.017
What? Crabs?

14:45.052 --> 14:48.013
I meant cramp. Why did I say crabs?

14:48.048 --> 14:51.552
How can a car give you crabs?
I don't know! Tell us!

14:51.587 --> 14:55.056
Oh, I know what I want to talk about.
Really big news.

14:55.091 --> 14:56.989
The new car from Pagani's out.

14:57.024 --> 14:59.005
The Zonda's gone. This is the new
replacement for it from Pagani.

14:59.040 --> 15:06.030
Look at that! It's an astonishing 730 brake
horsepower, six-litre AMG V12 specially
designed for the car.

15:06.065 --> 15:13.020
It's got a carbotanium body, so that is
carbon fibre, but titanium woven in with
carbon fibre in it.

15:13.055 --> 15:14.981
Yes, but can I interrupt?

15:15.016 --> 15:20.036
What worries me, we liked the Zonda
because it was completely bonkers, yes?

15:20.071 --> 15:21.965
Doesn't that look a bit sensible,

15:22.000 --> 15:28.012
like Lady GaGa going, "No, no, no. I'm a
musician now, I want to start writing
opera. " A bit serious? Yes.

15:28.047 --> 15:30.005
A bit grown-up? Yes. OK.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.045
Here's the interior, look at that!

15:32.080 --> 15:35.052
That's clearly not all
sensible and boring, is it?

15:35.087 --> 15:37.009
I like the colour, actually.

15:37.044 --> 15:41.076
Well if you want that colour, James, just
have a baby, get it eight times a day!

15:41.111 --> 15:45.084
What's it called?
It's called the Hur-rurgh... It is!

15:45.119 --> 15:48.040
It's spelled H-U-A-Y-R-A.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.096
The... The Hur-rurgh? Exactly!

15:54.048 --> 16:01.040
It's written here, in case you forget. It's
the noise you make when you're sick in the
passenger seat.

16:01.075 --> 16:08.064
If you're just going to mock, you won't
mind if I test it, will you? No, knock
yourself out!

16:08.099 --> 16:10.985
OK. No, don't actually,

16:11.020 --> 16:13.076
if you're driving fast...
I got that.

16:14.012 --> 16:16.993
Oh, day in, day out, we
meet people who say to us

16:17.028 --> 16:20.009
they don't like cars very much,
but they do watch Top Gear.

16:20.044 --> 16:25.028
Well, if you're not interested
in cars, ta-da! A new Ford Focus.

16:25.063 --> 16:28.981
Wow! There it is. You're not
saying it's bad, are you?

16:29.016 --> 16:33.044
No. No. That is some car. I tell you
something about Ford Focus, right,

16:33.079 --> 16:35.025
doing the figures this week on it,

16:35.060 --> 16:41.012
275 people a day in Britain
alone buy a Ford Focus.

16:41.047 --> 16:43.021
That is, what, about 12 an hour?

16:43.056 --> 16:48.076
So who's waking up at 3am thinking,
"I'm going to get a Focus.

16:48.111 --> 16:50.061
"I'm going to go out now.
" Who are they?

16:50.096 --> 16:53.025
No! That's the most mangled bit
of statistics I've ever heard.

16:53.060 --> 16:56.004
It doesn't mean that somebody has
to do it, on the hour, every hour.

16:56.039 --> 17:02.024
Yes, but it's still 275 people a day.
How can we work it out?

17:02.059 --> 17:04.997
We know Saabs are driven
by architects, yes?

17:05.031 --> 17:09.025
We know Audis are driven
by people who play golf.

17:09.060 --> 17:13.025
We know Land Rover Discoveries
are driven by murderers.

17:13.060 --> 17:19.016
What? I'm going to have to pull you up on
that, as I think you'll find murderers
drive a Renault Espace.

17:19.050 --> 17:23.547
Well, Kenneth Noye was a murderer,
he had a Land Rover Discovery.

17:23.582 --> 17:28.009
So he may have done, but Harold
Shipman drove a Renault Espace,

17:28.044 --> 17:33.088
Fred West drove a Renault Espace,
Peter Sutcliffe drove a Renault 16.

17:33.123 --> 17:37.016
That's only because the Espace
hadn't been invented. Exactly.

17:37.051 --> 17:39.977
This is a Top Gear top tip.

17:40.012 --> 17:44.016
If you're a policeman and there's
been a murder in your area,

17:44.051 --> 17:47.053
simply arrest anyone who
has a practical Renault.

17:47.088 --> 17:50.021
That's fascinating.
I think that's very interesting.

17:50.056 --> 17:56.012
Anyway, we got a bit off-topic, but there
you are, the new Ford Focus - ideal if you
just want some car.

17:56.047 --> 18:01.012
Chaps, listen, have you ever wanteda
Mexican sports car? Yes, I have!

18:01.047 --> 18:06.004
Well, it's good news, because
there is one, and here it is,

18:06.039 --> 18:07.977
and it's called the Tortilla.

18:08.012 --> 18:11.993
It is not, it is not called the
Tortilla! What is it called?

18:12.028 --> 18:16.048
I can't remember, it's somethinga bit...
You just made up the name?

18:16.083 --> 18:19.993
Yes, I've forgotten.
Why would you want a Mexican car?

18:20.028 --> 18:25.000
Cars reflect national characteristics, so
German cars are very well built, efficient.

18:25.035 --> 18:29.032
Italian cars are a bit flamboyant and
quick, a Mexican car is just going

18:29.067 --> 18:32.012
to be lazy, feckless,
flatulent, over-stuffed,

18:32.047 --> 18:33.057
leaning against a fence asleep,

18:33.092 --> 18:39.977
looking at a cactus, with a blanket
with a hole in the middle on, as a coat!

18:40.012 --> 18:46.028
It is interesting, they can't do food, the
Mexicans, can they? It's all like sick with
cheese on it.

18:46.063 --> 18:49.035
Refried sick! Yeah, refried sick.

18:49.070 --> 18:51.973
How much is this
Mexican sports car?

18:52.008 --> 18:57.020
The refried Mexican
sports car is L33,000.

18:57.055 --> 18:59.017
That isn't enough.

18:59.052 --> 19:04.048
It isn't enough. Somebody's paid for that
to be developed, it's got to be shipped
over.

19:04.083 --> 19:07.033
That's 800 quid's worth of carthere.
You say that though,

19:07.068 --> 19:10.088
but they do say, in their blurb,
it's got rack and pinion steering.

19:10.123 --> 19:12.041
Wow, it's got steering.

19:12.076 --> 19:16.004
I'm sorry, but just
imagine waking up

19:16.039 --> 19:18.013
and remembering you're Mexican!

19:18.048 --> 19:23.056
It would be brilliant. It'd be brilliant
because you could just go straight back to
sleep again.

19:23.091 --> 19:25.977
Oh, I'm a Mexican.
That's all I'm going to do all day.

19:26.012 --> 19:29.506
That's why we won't get complaints
about this - at the Mexican Embassy,

19:29.541 --> 19:33.000
the ambassador will be sitting there
with the remote control, like this.

19:33.035 --> 19:34.017
They won't complain, it's fine.

19:34.052 --> 19:41.024
I tell you want, there's a radio station in
Germany, offered L20,000 worth of a Mini
Cooper as a prize,

19:41.059 --> 19:45.551
to any listener who would do the
zaniest, craziest thing, OK?

19:45.586 --> 19:50.044
The chap who won it, won it
because he had the word "Mini"

19:50.079 --> 19:52.559
tattooed on his... Face?

19:52.594 --> 19:55.005
No. Arse? Elbow? No. Ears?

19:55.040 --> 20:00.989
No. Toes? No, on his
gentleman's sausage... Mini!

20:01.024 --> 20:05.056
If you think about it, Mini isn't really
the first word you would think to have
tattooed on you're...

20:07.068 --> 20:12.032
I'd rather have the word enormous, but in
tiny letters so the scale... it must be!

20:12.067 --> 20:15.051
If it's going to be cars, though,
I would have Alfa Romeo...

20:15.086 --> 20:18.001
No, I wouldn't have Alfa Romeo,
I'd only get Alf on mine.

20:18.036 --> 20:20.989
I think, actually, having Alfa
Romeo tattooed on your old chap

20:21.024 --> 20:27.068
is a bit of a leap of faith,given our
experience with Alfas. Oh, it's not working
again.

20:27.103 --> 20:31.060
It's never happened before.
It's an Alfa Romeo - it has!

20:31.095 --> 20:33.049
That's the end of the news.
Moving on now.

20:33.084 --> 20:40.024
In Britain, we find it really rather
revolting to talk about how much money
somebody earns, but I couldn't

20:40.059 --> 20:46.028
help but noticing the other day that a DJ,
I won't say which one, Radio 2, in the
morning, ginger,

20:46.063 --> 20:52.052
spent L12 million on a car. You might
think that's ridiculous, but it isn't.

20:52.087 --> 20:58.084
Because the car in question
is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO.

21:04.004 --> 21:06.044
'The GTO Ferrari... '

21:08.076 --> 21:16.033
In the eyes of many, the 250 GTO is the
greatest car Ferrari ever produced.

21:16.068 --> 21:23.056
Certainly, it's the greatest road racer
from the ultimate decade of road racing.

21:23.091 --> 21:28.044
And it is extremely rare
just 36 were made.

21:33.016 --> 21:38.044
And because the aluminium body panels
were hand-beaten over pieces of wood,

21:38.079 --> 21:40.033
none of them were quite the same.

21:40.068 --> 21:44.088
On this particular example, for
instance, the driver's door

21:44.123 --> 21:49.080
is a centimetre longer
than the passenger door.

21:51.036 --> 21:55.088
The 3-litre V12 engines
were all different as well.

21:59.096 --> 22:03.072
They were supposed to
produce 295 horsepower.

22:03.107 --> 22:07.048
Some came up with less
than that, some more.

22:09.072 --> 22:14.072
But all of these cars would
do 175 miles an hour,

22:14.107 --> 22:19.072
at a time when your dishwasher
had a name... and ears.

22:23.052 --> 22:29.036
I wish almost more than anything I could
get into this now and take it for a drive,

22:29.071 --> 22:32.969
but even though Top Gear is made
by one of the world's largest

22:33.004 --> 22:38.052
and richest broadcasting organisations,
we simply cannot afford the insurance.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.080
I can, however, drive this...

22:46.115 --> 22:48.088
the 288 GTO.

22:51.096 --> 22:58.033
The mid-engine twin turbo-charged flame
thrower was also built to be a road racer,

22:58.068 --> 23:05.016
but, sadly, the road-racing series it was
built to enter folded before it ever got
the chance.

23:10.068 --> 23:15.000
And, because it has no competition
pedigree, it's now a bargain.

23:15.035 --> 23:20.072
You can buy one for
as little as L400,000.

23:25.032 --> 23:30.025
When the final 288 rolled off the
limited-run production line in 1987,

23:30.060 --> 23:37.032
we all thought that, because road racing
was a thing of the past, we'd never see the
GTO name again,

23:37.067 --> 23:40.024
but we were wrong.

23:40.059 --> 23:42.004
It's back.

23:52.064 --> 23:56.092
This is the 599 GTO
and it's not a racer -

23:56.127 --> 24:01.092
it's a L300,000 road car.

24:03.068 --> 24:08.057
So they've used the GTO
name on a road car.

24:08.092 --> 24:12.985
That's brave. That's like
calling your infant son Jesus.

24:13.020 --> 24:17.036
You need to be fairly sure he's going
to grow up to be something special.

24:17.071 --> 24:19.004
Not a burglar.

24:19.020 --> 24:23.045
So, how has this turned out, then?

24:23.080 --> 24:26.969
Well, it's pouring with rain,
and, as usual, when we're...

24:27.004 --> 24:31.040
BEEPING .. down at the track, I've
turnedthe traction control off.

24:31.075 --> 24:33.032
So, here we go.

24:37.020 --> 24:39.068
Oh... argh...

24:39.103 --> 24:41.021
Nearly.

24:41.056 --> 24:45.012
Have I got it? No.

24:48.072 --> 24:49.096
No!

24:51.072 --> 24:53.012
Come on!

24:54.096 --> 24:59.080
It squirrels under braking, it understeers
when you go into a corner... Ah!

24:59.115 --> 25:03.024
Oh... BLEEP! Bloody hell!

25:05.000 --> 25:09.981
This is not a car -
it's a wild animal.

25:10.016 --> 25:14.068
Oh, actually, it's not evena
wild animal, just a BLEEP!

25:17.000 --> 25:18.048
BLEEP!

25:22.028 --> 25:28.008
Actually, what it is is the most
powerful road car Ferrari has ever built.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.057
Its 6-litre V12
produces 661 horsepower.

25:36.092 --> 25:39.033
And to make sure none of
those horse powers are wasted

25:39.068 --> 25:45.064
lugging around unnecessary weight,
the glass in the windows is thin.

25:45.099 --> 25:47.985
The body work is carbon fibre.

25:48.020 --> 25:53.048
The floor is aluminium.
There are no carpets.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.056
It doesn't even have a radio.

25:58.016 --> 26:05.052
The result, when you understand all that
and you respect it and you leave the
traction control on,

26:05.087 --> 26:07.020
is rather different.

26:10.016 --> 26:11.032
The speed!

26:12.052 --> 26:14.028
Speed!

26:15.064 --> 26:18.068
And the noise of the speed!

26:19.080 --> 26:22.068
0-60, 3.3 seconds.

26:22.103 --> 26:25.056
Top speed, 208.

26:30.012 --> 26:32.542
And then there's the braking.
OK, ready?

26:32.577 --> 26:35.037
Now, I just hold this
left-hand paddle down,

26:35.072 --> 26:41.044
and the down changes are done automatically
at precisely the right moment.

26:42.044 --> 26:44.084
It's a laptop!

26:48.028 --> 26:53.060
These days, automotive electronics are
used to make a car more economical,

26:53.095 --> 26:58.024
more environmentally
friendly, more safe.

27:00.056 --> 27:02.029
Not in this.

27:02.064 --> 27:06.028
In this, the electronics
make you faster.

27:09.024 --> 27:13.080
The car is learning all the time how
fast I can go round this corner.

27:15.004 --> 27:18.068
It's taking constant
readings of tyre temperature,

27:18.103 --> 27:21.965
engine temperature,
gear box temperature

27:22.000 --> 27:26.036
to make sure that when I put my
foot down at the end of the corner,

27:26.071 --> 27:31.000
the maximum amount of power
is sent to the rear wheels.

27:31.035 --> 27:35.004
I'll put my foot down now.
No, it's not ready.

27:35.039 --> 27:37.088
It's not ready! NOW it's ready.

27:40.060 --> 27:46.080
It is all fantastically clever,
but, I'm afraid, there is a but.

27:52.036 --> 27:56.566
Modern jet fighters are kept
in the air, not by the pilot,

27:56.601 --> 28:01.096
but by several million
gigabytes of hardcore software.

28:03.096 --> 28:07.000
And this is just the same.
It's an F-22

28:07.035 --> 28:09.064
with a tax disc.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.029
And that's the problem, because...

28:12.064 --> 28:15.036
I don't feel like I'm
driving this car -

28:15.071 --> 28:18.053
I just feel like a big lump of meat

28:18.088 --> 28:21.001
that's come along for the ride.

28:21.036 --> 28:26.965
Of course, I can't turn the computers
off - well, I can, but I'm not going to,

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
because that would be like sitting on the
front of a roller coaster and trying to
steer it.

28:34.044 --> 28:36.092
It's not my sort of car, this.

28:38.044 --> 28:40.088
And then there's the
problem with its name.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.076
If they'd called it Matthew or Mark

28:47.111 --> 28:51.009
or Typhoon or Herod, even,

28:51.044 --> 28:56.052
that would have been fine, but
they didn't, they called it a GTO.

28:57.072 --> 29:03.001
But it was not designed for
racing, so it's not a GTO.

29:03.036 --> 29:09.092
It's just a limited-edition tweaked
version of the car Gordon Ramsay drives.

29:15.064 --> 29:17.064
APPLAUSE

29:19.036 --> 29:22.025
So, it's not the Messiah.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.993
It's just a very naughty boy!
That's what it is.

29:26.028 --> 29:31.064
You know what, when you were driving with
the traction control off, it looked pretty
much undriveable.

29:31.099 --> 29:35.020
It was. The thing is, though, after I
made that film, I went to Italy with it.

29:35.055 --> 29:39.543
I drove it in the dry, and it was
a lot better, but, all the time,

29:39.578 --> 29:44.032
you can sense it's plotting on new
and exciting ways of killing you.

29:44.067 --> 29:47.985
You know Cato? What, from
the Pink Panther? Yeah.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.029
That's my favourite comic character,pretty
much. It's like that. You go around the
corner.

29:51.064 --> 29:55.064
You think "Yes, I've got this, I'm holding
this well. " Suddenly, it goes into a
massive tail slide.

29:55.099 --> 30:00.063
Not now, Cato. It is. You go back to a
hotel room at night thinking, "Is it in the
mini bar?

30:00.098 --> 30:04.993
"Is it on top of the wardrobe?" You know
it's going to leap out and attack you at
any moment.

30:05.028 --> 30:09.076
Maybe they shouldn't have called it the
Ferrari GTO, maybe they should have called
it the Ferrari Cato.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.037
That would have been quite a
good name for it, the Cato.

30:11.072 --> 30:17.068
But, anyway, we must now find out how fast
this Chinese psychopath goes round our
track.

30:17.103 --> 30:21.024
That, of course, means handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

30:21.059 --> 30:26.000
Some say that he doesn't
understand the word "envelope".

30:28.028 --> 30:31.057
And that he is the
only woman in Britain

30:31.092 --> 30:36.056
not to have slept with
Alan Johnson's policeman.

30:36.091 --> 30:39.036
All we know is, he's
called the Stig.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.997
And he's off.

30:42.032 --> 30:45.068
And just listen to the
noise of that V12.

30:45.103 --> 30:48.052
Actually, let's just listen.

30:48.087 --> 30:49.033
SILENCE

30:49.068 --> 30:54.024
Nope, can't hear it there.
So, first corner, coming in wide.

30:54.059 --> 30:55.013
Is it going to bite?

30:55.048 --> 31:00.032
Ooh, a little bit,
but he's through.

31:03.008 --> 31:07.049
No stereo in this car, of course,i
t's just got 12 cylinders. CAR REVS

31:07.084 --> 31:13.037
God, that noise is amazing. Now,
Hammerhead, I should say the braking system
on this car is phenomenal.

31:13.072 --> 31:20.072
Carbon ceramic, second generation, so the
Stig can brake very hard and very late, but
he's not braking now.

31:20.107 --> 31:21.993
ENGINE PURRS

31:22.028 --> 31:28.004
Oh, that noise is simply sensational.
It is spine-tingling!

31:32.080 --> 31:35.989
It's like God treading
on a Lego brick!

31:36.024 --> 31:39.548
Here he comes, second to
last corner. Into Gambon.

31:39.583 --> 31:43.072
Is Cato going to attack?
No, he's across the line!

31:43.107 --> 31:45.080
APPLAUSE

31:47.020 --> 31:49.068
He did well.

31:49.103 --> 31:51.021
OK.

31:51.056 --> 31:55.000
It did it... it did it in...

31:55.035 --> 31:56.037
1.19.8.

31:56.072 --> 31:59.049
Which is there.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.090
Look at this, it's 0.7

32:01.125 --> 32:03.106
of a second slower

32:03.141 --> 32:05.053
than the Ferrari 458.

32:05.088 --> 32:07.973
Which costs about
half as much. Yes.

32:08.008 --> 32:10.096
And you might be thinking how
well the Stig did on that lap, OK?

32:10.131 --> 32:14.056
In one of his practice laps,
I should say, this happened.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.060
There he is, going onto the straight.
Completely straight line.

32:19.095 --> 32:21.036
No! Not now, Cato!

32:21.071 --> 32:22.973
LAUGHTER

32:23.008 --> 32:25.005
What a car! What an animal!
Anyway...

32:25.040 --> 32:29.058
it is time now to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

32:29.093 --> 32:33.041
Now, my guest tonight is quit
literally a tennis player.

32:33.076 --> 32:40.020
He was able to win Wimbledon three times,
partly because of his immense strength,

32:40.055 --> 32:41.973
partly because of his agility,

32:42.008 --> 32:45.000
but mostly, I suspect,
because he isn't English.

32:45.035 --> 32:47.044
Ladies and gentlemen, Boris Becker!

32:47.079 --> 32:49.579
APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING

32:49.614 --> 32:52.045
Hello. How are you?

32:52.080 --> 32:55.040
Hello. Hello. Take a seat.

32:55.075 --> 32:56.965
Thank you.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.012
You're enormous.

33:01.008 --> 33:03.037
As tall as you?
You're bigger than I thought.

33:03.072 --> 33:09.088
A lot bigger than I thought you'd be. Now,
how does it feel to be the most popular
German in Britain?

33:12.028 --> 33:14.985
I guess the list isn't very long.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.046
No, you're right, actually,
it isn't very long.

33:17.081 --> 33:19.037
But it is, you are a
very popular chap here.

33:19.072 --> 33:23.981
Thank you very much. I think it has
a lot to do with Wimbledon, I guess.

33:24.016 --> 33:30.052
Yeah. First, for the younger members of the
audience, you were the first German to win
it,

33:30.087 --> 33:32.021
the first unseeded player to win it

33:32.056 --> 33:36.064
and you're stillthe youngest to this
day to winthe men's single final. Yeah.

33:36.099 --> 33:37.973
You were what - two?

33:38.008 --> 33:42.044
I was a little older, but I was still
a teenager - I was 17 years old.

33:42.079 --> 33:44.547
17! We've got a picture
of you here, actually.

33:44.582 --> 33:47.016
And I do have a big
question - these shorts...

33:49.052 --> 33:51.029
.. did they restrict movement?

33:51.064 --> 33:53.037
Well, at the time, we're
talking '80s, at the time,

33:53.072 --> 33:59.024
that was fashionable. I remember George
Michael had a pair similar to that in one
of his videos.

33:59.059 --> 34:02.555
I think they were stretch -
able to stretch a little bit -

34:02.590 --> 34:06.052
but, obviously, when you stretch
too far on an angle volley,

34:06.087 --> 34:09.056
you might lose... something!

34:09.092 --> 34:13.020
Now, of course, you've stopped playing
tennis, you are now a commentator.

34:13.054 --> 34:16.060
You're going to be commentatingagain
at Wimbledon this year? Yes.

34:16.094 --> 34:19.016
A small word of advice, if I may -

34:19.052 --> 34:23.045
have no opinions about the
looksof the lineswomen. OK.

34:23.081 --> 34:27.040
It is just a little tipI can give you.
Yeah, thank you.

34:27.074 --> 34:28.973
Otherwise, you'll
find yourself sacked.

34:29.007 --> 34:33.027
I was reading the papers the last
couple of days, I find it a bit harsh.

34:33.063 --> 34:36.088
It is a bit weird. You're not
even on television and you get...

34:36.123 --> 34:39.053
I mean, I'd be very sacked.
I mean, the guy...

34:39.088 --> 34:45.072
Andy, you know, he shouldn't have said it,
it was dumb, it was stupid, you don't say
that.

34:45.107 --> 34:51.056
But then he wasn't really on air. It should
have been a penalty, give some money to
charity,

34:51.091 --> 34:55.556
but for him to be fired and lose
his job, I think it's a bit harsh.

34:55.592 --> 35:00.024
No, I couldn't agree more.
Now, I want to get it on to cars, if I may.

35:00.059 --> 35:02.551
Please. You are a car man.

35:02.586 --> 35:05.009
I am crazy about cars, yeah.

35:05.044 --> 35:11.068
We have to declare an interest fromthe off,
you actually have threeMercedes
dealerships. Correct, yes.

35:11.103 --> 35:15.965
So what's the car you drive?
Let me think about it, it's a Mercedes.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.016
Oh, really, that's a surprise!No, my
favourite car,when I'm alone, is the SLS.

35:22.051 --> 35:26.004
You see. Yes, it's my favourite car.
You see. It's a fantastic car.

35:26.039 --> 35:28.049
We proved - the other two agreed
with me, they're not here,

35:28.084 --> 35:33.012
sadly, to back me up - but that is
the best car in the world, the SLS.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.977
Did I see yours parkedoutside
today? Exactly.

35:35.012 --> 35:38.977
I thought I'd come with my
best weapon to impress you.

35:39.012 --> 35:43.024
Now, your first car that you
bought as a teenager was a...?

35:43.059 --> 35:44.057
You're talking about
the Porsche 959.

35:44.092 --> 35:48.041
Yeah? True. That, it really was.
I thought it can't be true.

35:48.076 --> 35:52.989
No teenager goes, "Right, it's time to
buy my first car, I'll make it a 959."

35:53.024 --> 36:00.044
Cos the 959, let's be clear, it was built
for Group B rallying? Yeah. A ferociously
fast thing.

36:00.079 --> 36:04.044
It wasn't a street car. A very
sophisticatedfour-wheel drive system on it.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.025
Very sophisticated
and two turbos. Yeah.

36:06.060 --> 36:09.053
You had the first one kick in at a
certain speed and the second one kick in,

36:09.088 --> 36:15.004
and you were already flying all over the
place, and only 200 were sold or made for
the public.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.049
How old were you when you got it?

36:16.084 --> 36:20.005
19. Did you drive it
like a 19-year-old?

36:20.040 --> 36:25.032
I drove it rather fast and I - you
know, knock on wood - I didn't have

36:25.067 --> 36:30.024
an accident, but I wanted to show
that I'm a man, I'm not a teenager.

36:30.059 --> 36:31.049
And I had to drive top speed.

36:31.084 --> 36:36.044
So my best friend at the time, Patrick,
said, "Listen, let's together drive from
Frankfurt

36:36.079 --> 36:37.009
"to Monte Carlo,

36:37.044 --> 36:42.045
"and there's this highway from Milan down
to Geneva, three lanes, where we maybe give
it a go. "

36:42.080 --> 36:49.056
That's exactly what happened. So I went 326
on a highway - three times the speed limit
allowed in Italy.

36:49.091 --> 36:51.083
That's 200 miles an hour. Yeah.

36:51.118 --> 36:53.041
That is 200 miles an hour in Italy.

36:53.076 --> 36:57.021
Yeah. And you just said
that on television!

36:57.056 --> 37:01.013
But the Italian cars at the
time, they were too slow.

37:01.048 --> 37:07.048
So by the time I went over and passed
them, they, you know, they let me go.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.585
There is another reason
the Italian police,

37:08.620 --> 37:10.053
who you must have
encountered over the years,

37:10.088 --> 37:15.040
if you do 200 miles an hour,
theytend to just go... They like it!

37:15.075 --> 37:16.989
They like it. Good point.

37:17.024 --> 37:21.004
The other thing, of course, the Germans
are the best racing drivers as well.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.037
You had Schumacher for years.

37:22.072 --> 37:25.000
Do you know Schumacher?
Yeah, very well. A good mate?

37:25.035 --> 37:27.981
Good mate. He's come good nowadays.

37:28.016 --> 37:32.096
He in private is very different than on
camera, but when he's relaxed and
comfortable,

37:32.131 --> 37:34.977
he's a cool guy and
has lots of humour,

37:35.012 --> 37:38.053
but, obviously, when he speaks on
camera, it doesn't really show.

37:38.088 --> 37:43.973
Have you met Vettel?Yeah. Sebastian, yeah.
He needs to address his hair.

37:44.008 --> 37:49.029
Well... he's young, that's the look.
Those 21-year-olds wear it that way now.

37:49.064 --> 37:54.044
I think he looks stupid. I mean, you were
wise, you addressed your hair, you realised,

37:54.079 --> 37:59.088
"Hell, I'm ginger, I need to do
something about it. " Now you're not.

37:59.123 --> 38:01.041
He needs to do the same thing!

38:01.076 --> 38:04.558
But he doesn't worry.
He's got the helmet on when he works.

38:04.593 --> 38:08.040
That's true. When he's working,
he does have his helmet on.

38:08.075 --> 38:10.997
Now, your lap. Yeah, please.

38:11.032 --> 38:18.008
It's raining, predictably today!It was
raining... heavy. I had to... I was really
struggling and...!

38:18.043 --> 38:20.065
You're a competitive man?
Of course!

38:20.100 --> 38:22.053
I was seriously
worried that I'm going

38:22.088 --> 38:28.008
to be embarrassed by everybody, because
the steering wheel is on the right.

38:28.043 --> 38:29.989
Yes, the right side of the car.

38:30.024 --> 38:33.045
I'm driving on the left.
The wrong side of the car.

38:33.080 --> 38:39.020
Yeah? So, when I first went into the car, I
couldn't find the clutch, I broke down the
engine.

38:39.055 --> 38:43.076
I ruptured the first car also, because
I was braking wrong all of the time.

38:43.111 --> 38:47.048
Thank God, the last couple of laps...
and because of Schtick.

38:47.083 --> 38:51.029
Schtick told me the
whole secret about...

38:51.064 --> 38:55.032
This is the worst racing
driver excuses I've...!

38:55.067 --> 38:57.020
No, no, no. Schtick was good.

38:57.055 --> 38:58.973
Schtick?! Schtick!

38:59.008 --> 39:05.017
Schtick! When you said Shtick,I
was thinking Michael Stich?No...

39:05.052 --> 39:10.040
Now I'm with you. Stig. Stig.
You are the first German ever to try it.

39:10.075 --> 39:13.033
OK. Cos Michael Schumacher didn't.
He just did it in his Ferrari.

39:13.068 --> 39:17.052
You're the first personto do it... you
haven'tmentioned your broken foot. Well...

39:17.087 --> 39:21.021
You don't like to make a fuss.
No. When did you break it?

39:21.056 --> 39:28.064
Five weeks ago I had surgery. So, it's not
fully healed? No. So many things that went
wrong.

39:28.099 --> 39:33.005
Yeah, but thank God, I didn't have to use
my right leg this time, more my left.

39:33.040 --> 39:37.056
You know the pedals are the same whether
it's the left-hand drive... No, it's on the
wrong side. What?!

39:37.091 --> 39:43.547
Is the accelerator pedal on the leftin
Germany? No, it's on the right. It's the
same for us! No!

39:43.582 --> 39:49.303
It was confusing for me. Now, all of this
confusion did cause a few problems in your
practice...

39:49.338 --> 39:55.024
Yeah... in that every time I looked out of
the window, you were facing backwards on
the grass.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.567
Would anyone like to see that?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

39:57.602 --> 40:00.076
It's a quite a high s
peed one,this one. OK.

40:03.048 --> 40:08.004
And because you didn't know where the
brake was, it just kept going, really.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.969
Anyway, who would like
to see Boris's lap?

40:11.004 --> 40:14.060
Please! Please. AUDIENCE: Yeah!
Come on, let's have a look.

40:14.095 --> 40:17.053
ENGINE ROARS, TYRES SQUEAL

40:17.088 --> 40:19.977
That is an aggressive start.

40:20.012 --> 40:23.004
That's a gear change.
Come on, baby.

40:23.039 --> 40:24.076
Light my fire. Come on!

40:25.076 --> 40:30.044
There we go. Ooh, several attempts
at getting into the first corner.

40:31.072 --> 40:35.064
Almost got the back wheel
up there, which wasn't bad.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.551
Good. Good. Good. Come on!

40:37.586 --> 40:40.004
It's a good one. Looking good.

40:40.039 --> 40:42.061
That's smooth.

40:42.096 --> 40:45.088
That is, yes, very impressive.
Now, coming up to the Hammerhead.

40:45.123 --> 40:49.004
HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN I'm
speaking German and English.

40:49.039 --> 40:52.052
It's funny. Hey, hey! It's English.

40:52.087 --> 40:54.064
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

40:54.099 --> 40:55.981
Right.

40:56.016 --> 40:58.005
Hard on the brakes.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.096
That was quite slow but if it
looks slow it's normally fast.

41:02.131 --> 41:04.977
That's what he told me.

41:05.012 --> 41:08.076
It's true, the slower you
look, the faster you're going.

41:08.111 --> 41:11.060
But you do need to change
gear better than that!

41:11.095 --> 41:13.579
I show them. I'm not
only a tennis player,

41:13.614 --> 41:16.064
I'm actually a hidden
Formula One driver!

41:19.076 --> 41:23.080
Looking Formula One-ish through there,
apart from the car. Did you like the Kia?

41:23.115 --> 41:26.032
Yeah, it's good fun to drive.
It isn't bad, actually.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.989
Not bad at all.

41:28.024 --> 41:30.017
So much faster driving
than it actually looks.

41:30.052 --> 41:34.076
It's really not bad, that.
It is brown, but it's very nice.

41:34.111 --> 41:36.017
There we go, Gambon.

41:36.052 --> 41:39.020
Nicely controlled, and there
we are, across the line.

41:39.055 --> 41:40.064
APPLAUSE

41:43.024 --> 41:47.072
So... I should explain...

41:50.028 --> 41:52.037
These are the wet times.

41:52.072 --> 41:58.004
Realistically, you're not going to be at
the top of the board as it was pouring with
rain. A lot.

41:58.039 --> 42:01.012
Pouring with rain... Stormy, windy.

42:01.047 --> 42:03.049
Windy. Wrong side. Wrong side.

42:03.084 --> 42:06.037
Pedals were somehow the
wrong way round, as well.

42:06.072 --> 42:09.044
Only car in the world.
I can't think of anything else. Anyway,

42:09.079 --> 42:12.016
these are the wet times, so where
do you think you've come there?

42:12.051 --> 42:15.028
As long as I'm faster
than Angelina Jolie.

42:15.063 --> 42:17.036
It wasn't actually Angelina,

42:17.071 --> 42:20.045
it was Bill Bailey.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.985
OK. He fooled US!

42:23.020 --> 42:27.020
Anyway, I have the time.
You did it, Boris Becker...

42:27.055 --> 42:31.012
What's the fastest wet? 1.49.9.

42:31.047 --> 42:32.068
.. One...

42:34.020 --> 42:35.997
forty-... OK.

42:36.032 --> 42:38.013
He's leaning forward.

42:38.048 --> 42:41.032
.. five! There you go. Wow!

42:45.076 --> 42:48.058
I love it!

42:48.093 --> 42:51.005
That's great.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.024
Thank you. Impressive. Thank you.

42:54.059 --> 42:56.017
Impressive.

42:56.052 --> 42:59.076
APPLAUSE AND CHEERS OK. Thank you.

43:00.080 --> 43:04.973
This new Stig must bea
very good teacher. Yeah.

43:05.008 --> 43:08.045
Because the first couple of laps
I was way over 150, I'm sure.

43:08.080 --> 43:15.036
I made all of the mistakes in the book.
Sliding out, I didn't know how to
accelerate on the wrong side.

43:15.071 --> 43:18.025
Only the last couple of laps,
I started to do better.

43:18.060 --> 43:21.024
That is a very quick time.
So, it turns out you're not only

43:21.059 --> 43:24.067
a brilliant tennis player,
a brilliant commentator,

43:24.102 --> 43:27.041
but also a brilliant driver,
and an excellent guest.

43:27.076 --> 43:31.036
Ladies and gentlemen - Boris Becker!
Thank you very much. Thank you.

43:31.071 --> 43:33.084
APPLAUSE AND CHEERS

43:39.032 --> 43:46.016
Tonight we are engaged in a car-based
sporting challenge against our colleagues
from Top Gear Australia.

43:46.051 --> 43:49.000
Yes, it's like the Ashes for
people who don't like cricket.

43:49.035 --> 43:51.041
Which is us, really. Yes, it is.

43:51.076 --> 43:53.013
Anyway, here are the scores so far.

43:53.048 --> 43:57.070
We won the drag race, giving
us ten points and them nothing.

43:57.105 --> 44:01.092
We also scored a remarkable one-two
in the double-decker racing,

44:01.127 --> 44:03.997
giving us 30 and them 5.

44:04.032 --> 44:09.021
So the totals so far are 40
to us and a dismal 5 to them.

44:09.056 --> 44:14.080
Coming up now, though, is a challenge to
see which nation is best at synchronised
drifting.

44:17.024 --> 44:21.072
Our new Stig said he'd use the
Aston Vantage for this one,

44:21.107 --> 44:24.084
while Jeremy plumped
for a Jaguar XKR.

44:26.076 --> 44:29.032
TYRES SQUEAL

44:34.020 --> 44:35.985
Look at that!

44:36.020 --> 44:41.041
Side by side in perfect
slithering harmony.

44:41.076 --> 44:46.096
The Aussies could only spectate because
we'd explained to them that due to health
and safety rules,

44:46.131 --> 44:51.008
the judging had to be done
by residents of the UK.

44:53.092 --> 44:56.072
It's Torvill and
Dean, really, here.

44:56.107 --> 44:58.997
Nothing else to say.

44:59.032 --> 45:01.981
'Our routine was going well. '

45:02.016 --> 45:05.017
I think this is
looking very good now.

45:05.052 --> 45:09.072
'But then, thanks to me,
it sort of went wrong. '

45:12.040 --> 45:15.045
Oh, he's gone! That's got
to be points off for that.

45:15.080 --> 45:20.084
The judges, however, who had a much
clearer view of the action, disagreed.

45:23.016 --> 45:25.084
I'm assuming they're still there?

45:25.119 --> 45:27.099
You're kidding!

45:27.134 --> 45:29.080
They are very good.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.096
What are you watching?
Where have you been looking?

45:41.032 --> 45:44.000
Beat that, Bruce!

45:45.080 --> 45:47.578
It was now the Aussies' turn.

45:47.613 --> 45:50.041
So they unpacked their Stig

45:50.076 --> 45:54.080
and then I introduced them to
the cars they would be driving.

45:58.096 --> 46:00.021
What NOW?

46:00.056 --> 46:02.044
What happened to
the Holdens we had?

46:02.079 --> 46:04.032
They ARE Holdens? No, they're not!

46:04.067 --> 46:05.053
They are, nearly!

46:05.088 --> 46:07.568
No, they're not, it's a Vauxhall.

46:07.603 --> 46:10.013
Exactly. Vauxhalls, they are...

46:10.048 --> 46:13.049
like Ferraris.
That's how we think of them.

46:13.084 --> 46:17.096
They are four-door... They're
photocopier salesmen's cars.

46:17.131 --> 46:20.029
Exactly, this is a V6.

46:20.064 --> 46:24.080
This is a 2 litre. Yes, I couldn't get two.
I couldn't get two.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.005
You couldn't get two?
No, but it will be fine.

46:26.040 --> 46:30.036
Now get your Stig out, turn him the
right way up and let's get cracking.

46:35.060 --> 46:41.064
Despite the excellence of the mini cabs we
provided, the Aussies were, really rather
disappointing.

46:44.024 --> 46:45.009
Get up there!

46:45.044 --> 46:48.040
And then they crashed.

46:48.075 --> 46:49.068
It should be...

46:50.060 --> 46:53.058
Oh! You... boxhead!

46:53.093 --> 46:56.056
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:57.064 --> 46:58.989
He hit the Stig. The Stig.

46:59.024 --> 47:02.016
Very, very poor. I don't know about
you, but... I'm not impressed.

47:02.051 --> 47:04.045
Same here.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.041
Dismal, to be honest.

47:06.076 --> 47:10.000
You've put 11 up, you idiot!

47:12.032 --> 47:13.969
Hammond!

47:14.004 --> 47:15.057
You gave them 11!

47:15.092 --> 47:18.052
I thought it had a point on it.

47:18.087 --> 47:21.029
I thought it said 1.1!

47:21.064 --> 47:24.064
Does it count now I've voted?

47:27.096 --> 47:33.004
It did. But our guests were still
losing badly. So, to cheer them up,

47:33.039 --> 47:37.032
we decided to cook them
a typical Aussie lunch.

47:37.067 --> 47:40.551
Ready, steady, check it out!

47:40.586 --> 47:44.036
I think we've got enough there.

47:44.071 --> 47:45.057
Hmm!

47:45.092 --> 47:49.041
My grandfather was burnt less
than that when they cremated him.

47:49.076 --> 47:54.020
Did you know that barbecue is an
ancient Aboriginal word for diarrhoea.

47:54.055 --> 47:56.009
Well, it will be after we eat this!

47:56.044 --> 47:59.540
Why do you eat outside?
Honestly, why do you eat outside?

47:59.575 --> 48:03.036
The weather's conducive to it.
Do you have air-conditioning?

48:03.071 --> 48:06.024
Yes, we do. Why don't you
sit in air-conditioning?

48:06.059 --> 48:08.092
Because their houses
are disgusting!

48:08.127 --> 48:11.013
THEY ALL LAUGH

48:11.048 --> 48:16.020
'At this stage our good-natured
bantering was interrupted

48:16.055 --> 48:19.052
'by an alarming update
from the producers. '

48:21.096 --> 48:23.088
We've been accused of cheating.

48:23.123 --> 48:25.973
By who? The Australians.

48:26.008 --> 48:27.029
Their production team. What?!

48:27.064 --> 48:32.044
In the upside-down double-deckerracing
you remember we did... Hmm.

48:32.079 --> 48:33.965
Who won it? We did.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.044
But you were stationary
for an entire lap.

48:37.079 --> 48:39.539
You therefore finished a lap down.

48:39.574 --> 48:41.965
It's ridiculous, we weren't last.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.040
We lapped you. You stayed still
forone entire lap. It's really simple.

48:45.075 --> 48:47.049
You spun and were stationary.

48:47.084 --> 48:52.052
I did not labour long and hard over
cooking that to be told by you...

48:52.087 --> 48:54.084
Just pass them out the food.
This is what a fair man I am.

48:54.119 --> 48:58.009
Have a celebratory sausage
that you didn't come last.

48:58.044 --> 49:02.060
They did, they've let themselves
down, they've let the BBC down,

49:02.095 --> 49:04.989
they've let England down.

49:05.024 --> 49:07.540
Happily, the updated score board

49:07.575 --> 49:10.021
revealed they were
still far behind,

49:10.056 --> 49:14.020
but the next challenge was
right up their street.

49:14.055 --> 49:16.965
Motorised sheep-herding.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.032
OK. Guys, we've got you your bikes
,they are Australian. They're not.

49:21.067 --> 49:23.553
Well, what are they, then?
Austrian.

49:23.588 --> 49:26.005
Austrian, Australian, same thing!

49:26.040 --> 49:32.056
We'll let the sheep out of the pen, you
ride around a bit and then herd them back
in again. OK?

49:32.091 --> 49:33.985
No problem.

49:34.020 --> 49:37.024
You do realise that we're not upset
that these are Austrian dirt bikes?

49:37.059 --> 49:40.056
Why? Well, you made a
mistake, they're terrific.

49:40.091 --> 49:42.045
These are the best bikes. Really?

49:42.080 --> 49:47.012
What? So we've accidentally got
them good bikes. You idiots!

49:48.080 --> 49:53.036
Right, if you're ready,
I shall release...

49:53.071 --> 49:56.009
the sheep! Go on!

49:56.044 --> 49:58.008
They're not scared of me!

49:58.043 --> 50:00.049
Go. Go. Go.

50:00.084 --> 50:04.088
'To be honest, it wouldn't have made a
difference if we'd given them unicycles. '

50:06.052 --> 50:08.096
Come on. Come on. Come on.
They're very good, this lot.

50:08.131 --> 50:10.045
Shane, take them round.

50:10.080 --> 50:15.092
He was popping a wheelie to
scare them off to the right.

50:15.127 --> 50:17.017
See the way he's now

50:17.052 --> 50:20.074
anticipating where
that sheep will go.

50:20.109 --> 50:23.096
On the inside.
OK, get 'em, get 'em.

50:23.131 --> 50:26.033
That's it. Let's get 'em.

50:26.068 --> 50:30.005
I know, they've got
them all together.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.530
Send him that way. Go together.
Come with me. Come with me.

50:33.565 --> 50:37.020
I think when you're Australian,
you're born to do this.

50:37.055 --> 50:39.029
It's instinctive.

50:39.064 --> 50:42.088
Must eat, must breathe in
and out, must herd sheep.

50:43.088 --> 50:46.029
How good are you
at riding off-road?

50:46.064 --> 50:50.088
Me? I've no idea, never tried it.
Right. Have you ever ridden off-road?

50:50.123 --> 50:53.981
Not really. I've never
ridden off-road.

50:54.016 --> 50:59.008
'In less than two minutes the Aussies
had all the sheep back in the pen. '

50:59.043 --> 51:05.012
Hey! Together, together.
You guys get 'em.

51:12.096 --> 51:16.016
Well done. Mate,
they won't beat that!

51:17.060 --> 51:20.092
'This was hardly the
revelation of the century... '

51:20.127 --> 51:23.981
Up the hill, come on. Bloody hell.

51:24.016 --> 51:28.000
'.. given that James and I were
working with Evil Knievil. '

51:28.035 --> 51:30.072
Right, I'm in gear...

51:33.072 --> 51:34.997
Clutch.

51:35.032 --> 51:38.044
ENGINE STOPS

51:38.079 --> 51:41.021
A- a-a-a-argh!

51:41.056 --> 51:43.001
No! No! They're all split.

51:43.036 --> 51:46.012
Up the hill, come on. HORN TOOTS

51:46.047 --> 51:49.013
No! Bloody hell!

51:49.048 --> 51:51.064
Feed in the power like a learner.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.033
ENGINE STOPS Why are
you doing this?!

51:55.068 --> 52:00.048
It's amazing that a bloke can be on a car
show for this many years and have so little
mechanical sympathy.

52:00.083 --> 52:02.013
Help! I think this will work.

52:02.048 --> 52:06.076
Eventually, they'll get so inquisitive,
they'll want to go and see what he's trying
to do.

52:06.111 --> 52:08.040
It's going! It's moving!

52:09.040 --> 52:11.088
It's moving! Where are the sheep?

52:11.123 --> 52:15.013
A- a-a-argh!

52:15.048 --> 52:16.977
Look, you stupid woolly BLEEP.

52:17.012 --> 52:20.040
Maybe the trick is to sneak
up on them and do it quietly.

52:20.075 --> 52:25.040
Right, watch this.
Right, got you, got you, go!

52:25.075 --> 52:27.036
How the hell does it do that?

52:28.036 --> 52:30.013
Look at me, I'm a shepherd!

52:30.048 --> 52:33.548
I'm shepherding! Look at me!
Hammond, look!

52:33.583 --> 52:37.048
No, that's the next one.
They're in the woods.

52:37.083 --> 52:41.985
No. Bad. Bad. Bad thing we've done!

52:42.020 --> 52:45.064
That's what made British Leyland
great, it's that kind of teamwork.

52:48.028 --> 52:50.049
This event had been a disaster.

52:50.084 --> 52:57.096
'The Aussies had been awarded 10 points and
we'd got minus 20 for losing all the sheep.
'

52:57.131 --> 52:59.609
So we were behind on the scoreboard

52:59.644 --> 53:02.088
as we went into the final event.

53:05.024 --> 53:08.556
A race on a World Championship
rally stage through the grounds

53:08.591 --> 53:12.088
of what we had told the Aussies
was a typical British house.

53:15.004 --> 53:17.977
These are the cars we'll be using.

53:18.012 --> 53:22.017
Super 2,000 Protons, four-wheel
drive, 280 horse power.

53:22.052 --> 53:28.008
The Australians will be using this one and
James will be driving... James? Yeah, James.

53:28.043 --> 53:29.025
Why does it have to be James?
It's got to be James.

53:29.060 --> 53:33.092
You did the drag race.
I did the drifting, so it's his turn.

53:33.127 --> 53:36.040
Remember who took on
the Germans, remember?

53:36.075 --> 53:37.567
Oh, JAMES?

53:37.602 --> 53:39.311
James! James!

53:39.346 --> 53:41.020
He'll like it.

53:41.055 --> 53:42.977
Yeah.

53:43.012 --> 53:47.084
'While JAMES was getting ready, the
Aussies arrived to inspect the cars. '

53:47.119 --> 53:49.045
They identical this time?

53:49.080 --> 53:52.016
They are identical, hand on heart.

53:52.051 --> 53:53.985
Who's driving yours?

53:54.020 --> 53:57.092
Steve. You're driving that one and who's
your co-driver? You're the co-driver.

53:57.127 --> 54:02.016
Hammond is the co-driver in this and
James is going to be driving it.

54:02.051 --> 54:03.072
Oh, here he comes now.

54:05.040 --> 54:08.058
There we go. Lovely.
Right, let's get on with this, then.

54:08.093 --> 54:11.041
Hang on. Hang on. Do you think
our eyes are painted on?

54:11.076 --> 54:15.044
You're cheating again. May thebest
man win. James... All aboard.

54:17.012 --> 54:22.032
Because the Aussies were 15.1 points
ahead of us on the scoreboard,

54:22.067 --> 54:26.028
they were allowed a head
start of 15.1 seconds.

54:26.063 --> 54:29.013
Hey! Are you ready?

54:29.048 --> 54:31.072
ENGINES REV This is it...

54:31.107 --> 54:34.080
three, two, one, go!

54:39.084 --> 54:43.001
That a boy. Wahey!

54:43.036 --> 54:45.084
Right, we've got 15
seconds, remember.

54:48.028 --> 54:50.520
Three, two, one, go!

54:50.555 --> 54:53.012
Oh, we're going.

54:54.096 --> 54:59.037
'If we could beat them by even
a second, we'd win the Ashes.

54:59.072 --> 55:04.028
'Unfortunately, they'd saved their
pro racing driver for this event. '

55:05.084 --> 55:08.036
I know this stuff. This is gravel.

55:09.088 --> 55:12.092
'Happily, though,
James was on fire!'

55:12.127 --> 55:14.052
Oh, my God!

55:18.052 --> 55:22.076
I hope I don't wet myself in James's...
Your race suit, your race suit, yeah.

55:29.088 --> 55:32.013
That was all right, wasn't it?
Yeah. Good.

55:32.048 --> 55:36.052
I don't even know how
far ahead they are now.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.084
Oh, my God. Yes!
Look at your little feet going.

55:42.119 --> 55:45.000
May, you're a different
man in this car!

55:48.040 --> 55:51.558
Time for the hand-brake,
are you ready? Righto.

55:51.593 --> 55:55.076
Hey! Not bad. Not bad
for a circuit driver.

55:58.008 --> 56:00.000
I see dust, that's got to be them.

56:00.035 --> 56:02.004
That could be them.

56:04.056 --> 56:08.092
Oh! That's just...
He's getting better!

56:12.052 --> 56:15.965
'James had almost
caught the Aussies

56:16.000 --> 56:19.969
'but then, with just two
miles to go, disaster. '

56:20.004 --> 56:24.064
I know this stuff, this is asphalt.
Yep. Now I'm back in business!

56:27.056 --> 56:30.028
That's quite brisk now!

56:32.052 --> 56:36.064
'Luckily, James preferred
the tarmac surface too. '

56:36.099 --> 56:39.020
Oh, he's in the zone!

56:41.052 --> 56:43.048
Come on, Stevie, keep going!

56:46.016 --> 56:47.997
Not far to go now!

56:48.032 --> 56:50.993
'Even though we were right
on their tail, it didn't look

56:51.028 --> 56:56.092
'like we would be able to pass, but let's
not forget, this was James at the wheel!'

56:56.127 --> 56:57.096
Oh!

57:02.048 --> 57:03.052
Argh!

57:07.012 --> 57:10.052
Oh, my God, Stig...
James, you've gone mad!

57:15.072 --> 57:19.092
What's he doing? Unbelievable!

57:19.127 --> 57:22.080
It really is. He's good.

57:26.072 --> 57:29.096
OK, I can hear 'em.
Yeah. Keep going.

57:31.004 --> 57:33.033
We've got to beat The Stig.

57:33.068 --> 57:36.044
Come on, James,
this is your moment!

57:40.056 --> 57:42.072
Oh...!

57:44.072 --> 57:45.092
Ooh!

57:47.044 --> 57:48.969
Who is that?

57:49.004 --> 57:52.064
That can't be James? Not driving...

57:53.096 --> 57:58.088
Yes! It's the United Kingdom!

58:05.020 --> 58:06.057
Oh, mate!

58:06.092 --> 58:08.060
Yes, stay cool! Yeah!

58:13.060 --> 58:17.044
Bruce! Sorry about that, Bruces.

58:17.079 --> 58:18.985
Can James get out?

58:19.020 --> 58:21.080
He's overcome. He's overcome.

58:21.115 --> 58:24.037
He's actually asleep.

58:24.072 --> 58:26.092
He sleeps it off.
He doesn't look asleep.

58:26.127 --> 58:28.593
Very tired, very tired.

58:28.628 --> 58:31.350
Bruce... Unbelievable.

58:31.385 --> 58:34.037
13,000 miles, pointlessly.

58:34.072 --> 58:37.060
Well, you came second...
which means you lost!

58:43.056 --> 58:45.977
APPLAUSE

58:46.012 --> 58:47.088
Well done, mate!

58:49.040 --> 58:51.044
Well done.

58:51.079 --> 58:53.013
Lovely.

58:53.048 --> 58:59.036
Was it just me or did anyone else see that
funny looking bloke who put his face round
the tree? Yes! No!

58:59.071 --> 59:02.033
That hideously ugly tree troll

59:02.068 --> 59:06.053
that put its ghastly gargoyle face
round the tree and then disappeared?

59:06.088 --> 59:10.574
Can I just stop you for a moment, because
since we filmed that, obviously Australia
has been

59:10.609 --> 59:15.025
blighted with terrible floods, a lot of
people were killed, a lot of people are
missing.

59:15.060 --> 59:19.048
If you're one of the people whose house is
now several miles from where you left it,
we would just

59:19.083 --> 59:22.048
like to say we are thinking of you
and we wish you all the very best.

59:22.083 --> 59:23.993
You're being nice. I know.

59:24.028 --> 59:26.013
On that bombshell,
it's time to end.

59:26.048 --> 59:28.068
Thank you very much for
watching, good night!
