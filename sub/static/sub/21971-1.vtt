00:33.467 --> 00:34.800
Fuck you! 

00:35.735 --> 00:38.170
Fuck you. Fuck you!

01:11.638 --> 01:14.106
-I had a dream
about dad last night.
-What?

01:14.108 --> 01:15.574
- Said I had a dream about dad.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.576
-Was it a good dream?
-Oh, the best.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.511
He said he knew we'd come
through for him.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.647
He said, "blood
calls to blood."

01:21.649 --> 01:23.849
Sounds like just
what he'd say.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.352
Hey, why do you suppose
they call it the Arizona
state penitentiary?

01:27.354 --> 01:27.352
What do you
wanna call it, Rick?

01:27.354 --> 01:30.589
-First baptist church?
-They're all about statement.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.224
No, it's a prison, ain't it?

01:32.226 --> 01:33.592
Yes, it's prison, all right.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.127
Well, why don't they
call it that?

01:35.129 --> 01:37.596
Penitentiary is just
a five dollar word for prison.

01:37.598 --> 01:37.596
You know, like "state penn".

01:37.598 --> 01:39.698
-Is that what that means?
-Uh-huh.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.166
I never sensed that.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.168
I thought it meant like
a "pen" for pigs,

01:43.170 --> 01:45.370
or what not, except for men.
A men-pen.

01:45.372 --> 01:48.207
Be sure and tell dad that,
he'll get a kick or something.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.409
- All right.
- Shut up, both of you.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.512
I need you listen to me
and do exactly as we
planned, all right?

01:53.514 --> 01:54.813
We got one shot at this.

01:54.815 --> 01:54.813
Can't have any mistakes.

01:54.815 --> 01:59.284
Yeah. We'll do whatever you
say until we get dad back.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.120
-Then he is in charge.
-Fine.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.421
Until then it's me.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.789
Aye, aye, captain.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.209
Good morning.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.811
-Is it?
-I aim it to be.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.679
Show what's in the bag.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.184
Shame they got you working
two Sundays in a row, eddy.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.620
Sunday morning coming
down, like the man says.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.423
Visitor coming on through.

02:45.732 --> 02:46.798
Sir.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.936
-Donnie come with?
-Yes, sir.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.171
He did.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.941
I wasn't sure he would.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.177
I knew I could count
on you, son.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.611
Yes, sir. You sure can.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.814
Mom made you
some sandwiches.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.720
I could eat some.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.225
<i> There is a block-way.</i>

03:13.227 --> 03:14.393
<i> A6, come up.</i>

03:23.303 --> 03:25.237
Greenawalt, get up
on those dank sheets.

03:32.579 --> 03:33.745
What the hell is this?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.447
It's Christmas in July.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.749
New IBM's electric.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.752
All the big titted young
secretaries are salivating
for one.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.355
Well?

03:44.624 --> 03:46.425
I don't like these
electric models.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.394
Their hum gives
me a headache.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.464
There they are.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.668
I heard you boys will
be tagging along real soon.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.970
Soon as your brother got here.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.504
Let me see.

03:59.973 --> 03:59.972
Whoa!

03:59.974 --> 04:04.443
--Hey, now, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.345
Now, don't do another wrong,
nobody will get hurt,
all right?

04:06.347 --> 04:07.579
We don't wanna hurt no one.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.350
Put it down.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.385
Put on them, Ricky.

04:13.620 --> 04:13.619
Easy.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.821
-All right, get down.
-Greenawalt.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.923
-Get down. Don't move.
-Easy. Easy.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.690
You are making
a big mistake, boy.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.560
Yeah, well, don't you go
making another one, all right?

04:23.997 --> 04:25.364
Come on.

04:25.732 --> 04:26.999
Get on, Rick.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.400
Shut the hell up back there.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.701
- Shut up. Shut up.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.737
Nobody, nobody move.

04:35.675 --> 04:36.708
Dad.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.312
Don't move.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.618
Stay go, low boy.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.919
I'm good.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.288
I'm good.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.823
Hey, dad, dad!

04:51.825 --> 04:51.823
Hey, hey!

04:51.825 --> 04:55.060
Eddy, you finger that
squawk box, you're all dead.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.530
Now unbuckle them duty belts.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.865
-Take it easy.
-Both of them.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.366
Don't try anything funny.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.335
Nothing funny here.
Nothing funny here.

05:03.337 --> 05:03.335
You said that right.

05:03.337 --> 05:07.372
If any of you get the idea
to try to key out some
distress call,

05:07.374 --> 05:08.940
or do something
stupid like that,

05:08.942 --> 05:11.410
I won't hesitate
to paint these walls

05:11.412 --> 05:12.711
the color god gave you.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.781
Stay down.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.350
Come on, Rick.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.885
Easy.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.653
All right.
Keep that on him.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.089
-Damn good.
-All right.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.558
Get your shit on quick.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.827
Get 'em in there.
Let's go. Let's go.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.495
-Go on. Go on.
-Get in there, eddy.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.064
Move.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.933
-Step on it.
-Come on, go on.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.967
God dammit.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.369
-Let's go.
-Come on.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.570
Go, move now.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.638
-Come on.
-Come on.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.606
-Come on.
-Get in there.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.709
-Guys, get the guns in there.
-Here. Here.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.678
Last time I saw
a rack like that,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.613
I was holding
a magazine sideways.

05:49.782 --> 05:49.781
Nursing a tot?

05:49.783 --> 05:52.784
- Come on, let's go.
- -Yes, mister.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.487
Sure as hell wish
it was me.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.656
All right, get in there.
Let's go. Come on.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.147
You boys really showed
me something.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.383
-Thanks, sir.
-It's like Christmas.

06:24.385 --> 06:24.383
You remember Christmas, dad?

06:24.385 --> 06:28.653
Oh, yeah, it's like Christmas,
easter, your birthday,

06:28.655 --> 06:30.722
the fourth of July,
all rolled into one.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.023
God damn!

06:32.025 --> 06:34.059
Hey, what you got to say
for yourself, old boy?

06:34.061 --> 06:36.061
You're gonna be all right now
that you're a free man?

06:37.130 --> 06:37.129
Hey, boy.

06:37.131 --> 06:42.000
We just got away from the big
house without a shot fired.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.902
Cleaner than
a whore's Bible.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.771
How's that, dad?

06:45.773 --> 06:48.673
A whore's Bible is clean,
because it's never been
cracked.

06:59.819 --> 07:00.986
Out.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.628
-What the hell is this?
-It's the car he gave us.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.831
I asked for a four-by.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.167
Now how do you think
we're gonna drive
across the sand

07:15.169 --> 07:16.835
in this goddamn tank?

07:16.837 --> 07:20.005
Uncle Joe said it's the best
he could do right now.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.940
Goddamn your uncle Joe.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.608
Give me the goddamn keys.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.010
I'm driving
this goddamn car.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.847
God dammit.

07:35.855 --> 07:35.854
We're gonna be late, Jack.

07:35.856 --> 07:39.558
No, no, we'll be just fine...
Look.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.793
Lend me hand
with this damn thing,
would you?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.028
I swear.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.497
John Cooper without me.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.732
No way, you're swearing
before church.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.668
Well, you're right,
we better hurry up
or you gonna

07:49.670 --> 07:51.470
send us both
to the fiery furnace.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.804
Yeah, you know what I mean.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.773
- I do know what you mean.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.709
-Oh, just leave it.
-No, no, I've got it.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.714
Yeah, Cooper.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.683
<i> Sir,</i>
<i> this is warden Blackwell.</i>

08:04.685 --> 08:06.485
<i> Can you come on out here?</i>

08:06.487 --> 08:06.485
Do what now?

08:06.487 --> 08:10.188
<i> We had a break</i>
<i> in the big house.</i>
<i> Gary tison...</i>

08:12.091 --> 08:13.492
All right, I will.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.528
What is it?
What happened?

08:18.965 --> 08:21.099
Gary tison just busted
out of prison.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.768
"Tison"? How can that be?

08:23.770 --> 08:27.739
Well, I am surprised that
it took the son of a bitch
this long.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.143
What are you gonna do?

08:34.647 --> 08:35.981
I am gonna bust
him back in.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.028
I need you to pick them up,

08:50.030 --> 08:51.630
they'll be out over in hyner.

08:51.632 --> 08:51.630
You shouldn't
be calling me here.

08:51.632 --> 08:56.101
<i> I don't intend</i>
<i> to keep you long enough</i>
<i> for anyone to take notice.</i>

08:56.103 --> 08:57.869
He said you know the place.

08:57.871 --> 08:57.869
Some cabins up there.

08:57.871 --> 09:03.074
He jumped the gun, without
giving me enough time
to rush through this.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.609
<i> I can't just drop everything.</i>

09:04.611 --> 09:04.609
Rush ain't hardly
the word.

09:04.611 --> 09:08.813
Now you better find a way
to get that plane up there
and do as you're told,

09:08.815 --> 09:11.182
<i> or their blood is gonna be</i>
<i> on your hands.</i>

09:11.184 --> 09:13.985
The time for talking is over.
It's doing time.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.833
- Hey, honey.
-Hi.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.135
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

09:32.939 --> 09:32.938
What can I get you?

09:32.940 --> 09:38.009
I'd like a cup of coffee
and a slice of Tennessee
lemon pie.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.345
Oh, I am sorry, this one
over here got the last piece.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.646
Is that so?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.316
Sorry.

09:45.751 --> 09:46.918
You got apple?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.086
Ice cream on top?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.187
Come any other way?

09:49.189 --> 09:50.288
Not in these parts.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.167
You from Tennessee?

10:02.169 --> 10:04.769
No, ma'am.
Just like the pie.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.904
Mm.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.107
I like your hair.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.376
Thank you, sweetie.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.682
You're Dorothy tison?

10:17.684 --> 10:17.682
What's this all about?

10:17.684 --> 10:21.052
You need to come on down
to the station and answer
some questions for me.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.288
-Wait a minute.
What has she done?
-Ma'am.

10:26.258 --> 10:29.194
Your husband has escaped
from Arizona state
penitentiary.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.328
You need to come with me.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.899
It's for her own protection.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.701
You want me to call
anyone for you?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.837
It's all right, sweetie.
I'll be fine.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.672
It's not my first time
in the capper, you see.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.813
We got Dorothy tison
in custody.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.051
Move on out.

10:58.357 --> 10:59.924
Hey, it's Fuller.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.126
What do we have
on a prison break?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.451
Did you see the look
on that old lady's face

11:26.453 --> 11:29.120
when he saw the muzzle
of that 16 Gauge?

11:29.122 --> 11:32.023
I think that bastard like
to shit his pants.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.959
Like, they were all just
waiting for someone to get up
off the floor

11:34.961 --> 11:37.262
and do something, you know.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.931
Guys, you could bust a gut
just thinking about it.

11:39.933 --> 11:40.999
Hey, you see that?

11:43.169 --> 11:45.737
Nobody got hurt.
We're 100 miles gone.

11:45.739 --> 11:46.871
Dad's out.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.808
All right, listen to me.
Donnie.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.811
You cover the car up
with the tarp
once it cools off.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.979
Ray, you got the first watch.

11:54.981 --> 11:58.016
Ricky, you get that radio
inside and see what you
hear what they're saying.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.317
You think we'd
be on the radio?

11:59.319 --> 12:01.019
Top of the charts.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.421
Randy, what the fuck
did I tell you, huh?

12:03.423 --> 12:03.421
There any beer in this box?

12:03.423 --> 12:08.226
<i> Authorities</i>
<i> tell us the situation is well</i>
<i> in hand.</i>

12:08.228 --> 12:10.862
<i> And the public has nothing</i>
<i> to fear from these men.</i>

12:10.864 --> 12:12.297
<i> However should you spot them,</i>

12:12.299 --> 12:14.766
<i> do not engage them,</i>
<i> but call the police.</i>

12:14.768 --> 12:15.934
<i> And now, something--</i>

12:15.936 --> 12:17.869
-that's good news.
-How's that?

12:17.871 --> 12:19.270
They're telling people
to keep their heads.

12:19.272 --> 12:19.270
Telling them there's
nothing to worry about.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.173
If they say they got
the situation in hand,

12:22.175 --> 12:24.042
it means they could
be close, yeah?

12:24.044 --> 12:24.042
Or it could just be bluster.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.178
All right, listen here's
what we're going to do.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.480
We're going to keep
our heads about us,

12:28.482 --> 12:28.480
just like the radio says,

12:28.482 --> 12:31.816
and uncle Joe's going to get
that plane here,

12:31.818 --> 12:33.518
and we're going to be in Mexico
free and clear.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.920
And if he is a day late,
we got some time,

12:35.922 --> 12:38.156
there's this little bank
i am thinking we might
ought to hit.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.158
-There you go.
-Casinos use it.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.227
And the cash piles up like
you couldn't imagine.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.828
Sure that's a good idea?

12:43.830 --> 12:47.031
You being a fugitive,
and us never robbing a bank.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.266
How much money
you got in your pockets?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.335
Not much.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.903
Come on, give me a number.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.171
Open up your pockets.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.074
About eight.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.442
So, you think you're
going to run this thing

12:57.444 --> 12:59.244
on eight bucks
and two bits?

12:59.246 --> 13:01.846
You need to sit back
and let the captain
steer the ship.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.483
I am so proud of you, boys.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.954
You know the law
can't keep apart

13:09.956 --> 13:11.322
what god meant to be together.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.792
Blood calls to blood.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.860
Blood answer back.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.429
I love you, boys.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.132
Oh, oh, dad.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.802
-What?
-Tell him.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.203
I dreamed you last night,

13:25.205 --> 13:26.871
and it's just what you said.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.807
"Blood calls to blood."

13:28.809 --> 13:31.342
You hear that?

13:31.344 --> 13:34.112
My number three son,
the name you know about,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.881
dreams of things that
i am gonna say
the very next day.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.984
He ain't the brightest bulb.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.053
Just got fire in him,
just the same.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.321
Go ahead and cry, kid.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.957
I ain't sad.
I'm happy.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.525
I'm happy to have
you back, dad.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.895
I am so glad to be back
with my boys.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.530
He's sticking around
all the way to Mexico?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.434
I thought I told you
to let me handle things.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.169
Said, blood calls to blood.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.205
He ain't my blood.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.040
Yours neither.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.142
-That you know of.
-What is it, then?

14:04.510 --> 14:05.877
Cousin?

14:06.111 --> 14:07.512
Uncle?

14:07.514 --> 14:10.381
What are we supposed
to call him, uncle Randy?

14:10.383 --> 14:12.584
He may not be your blood,
but he is my blood.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.421
And you know what else?

14:16.423 --> 14:19.090
He'd damn sure take
a bullet for me.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.458
And he'd give one, too.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.160
And what I need to know,

14:22.162 --> 14:24.462
is when the mouth of hell

14:24.464 --> 14:26.931
opens wide
to swallow us up,

14:28.400 --> 14:29.500
would you?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.341
Yeah.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.077
I would.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.880
You're my oldest boy, Donnie,

14:43.515 --> 14:45.216
I need you to set
an example.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.252
I need to know that I can
count on you.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.454
Yes, sir.

14:49.989 --> 14:50.989
Dad.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.258
Hey, dad.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.559
Yeah.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.327
Are the girls pretty
in Mexico?

15:00.299 --> 15:03.201
I don't know, but the liquor's
cheap if they ain't.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.973
Don't tell your mother
i said so.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.446
<i> ...casa grande north</i>
<i> to court side, copy.</i>

15:17.082 --> 15:19.651
Now, I'd like you to answer
few questions for me,

15:19.653 --> 15:22.086
help me understand what's
going on here.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.289
Well, I don't know that
i understand it myself.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.624
Well, then we will work
through it together,
all right?

15:28.327 --> 15:30.628
Now I believe you know
why you're here.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.331
Well, they said
something about an escape
up at the prison.

15:33.333 --> 15:33.331
That's right.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.267
I don't know I can help
you with that, officer.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.936
Yeah, well...

15:37.938 --> 15:40.972
Your sons, Richard, Raymond
and Donald helped

15:40.974 --> 15:45.977
your husband and an other
murderer Randall greenawalt,

15:45.979 --> 15:48.479
burst out of the annex
this morning.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.682
Now, I need you to tell
me exactly

15:50.684 --> 15:53.952
when was the last time
you had contact
with your husband.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.219
A...

15:56.655 --> 15:56.654
Say what now?

15:56.656 --> 15:59.390
You said my husband
and another murderer.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.626
My husband
is not a murderer.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.667
You know, two of your boys
are over 18.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.004
That means they will be tried
as adults and sent
to prison.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.473
What, you're gonna send
a boy out to prison for loving
his daddy?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.342
They love their daddy,
don't they?

16:17.344 --> 16:17.342
Yeah.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.478
Yeah, you all
visit him regular?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.347
-Once a week?
-We go every Sunday.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.482
And so the last time
you saw him

16:24.484 --> 16:27.085
was last week, or less?

16:27.087 --> 16:29.387
-Yeah.
-And you mean to tell me
you know nothing

16:29.389 --> 16:30.655
about this bust?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.290
Well, you say
there's been a bust,

16:32.292 --> 16:34.258
but I don't know
that there has.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.697
Man that broke out of prison
with your husband.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.466
Randy greenwalt,
you know him?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.768
-He maybe the one behind it.
-No, you know him?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.570
I couldn't say.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.006
-Ma'am.
-I don't know how
i can help you, officer.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.041
Yeah, well, you can start
by telling the truth.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.510
The truth is the easiest
thing to remember.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.312
Well, I'd like to ask
you a question.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.747
I am all ears.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.415
You tell me the truth.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.516
Hand to god.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.586
Should I have a lawyer
with me right now?

17:15.099 --> 17:16.367
What was that for?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.801
Well, I ain't your
fucking uncle.

17:17.804 --> 17:17.801
Yeah, I know that.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.571
I will beat the Christ
out of you like I was.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.074
Best go back to bed.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.410
I give the orders around here.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.512
Me and Gary.

17:27.513 --> 17:31.382
And I say it's time for you
to get up and keep watch.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.685
So get the fuck up.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.786
I thought you
was keeping watch?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.755
Sorry, sir.
I guess I dozed off.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.861
You know, I am gonna ask
you something.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.163
Your mom says something,
this and the other,

18:19.165 --> 18:21.599
that you're
having some doubts.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.503
And I told her there
was nothing to worry about

18:25.505 --> 18:27.472
when it comes to Donnie.
Now was I wrong?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.273
No, sir.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.710
I got nothing
to worry about?

18:33.812 --> 18:34.879
No. Not from me.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.484
You just don't know
him, that's all.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.586
He's good in the spot.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.287
He's saved me more than twice.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.859
Uncle Joe should
be coming with the plane
today

18:47.861 --> 18:50.194
then everything
will be all right.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.629
From your mouth
to god's ears.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.233
I didn't think you
believed in god.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.534
Shh. You don't know that.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.746
- Hey, hey.
- -What?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.183
I want you to take
Ricky into town,

19:12.185 --> 19:13.851
get some supplies,
pick up some food.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.622
Pick me up two cartons
of full flavored kings.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.689
Yes, sir.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.691
Hey.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.327
Hey, come on.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.796
Dipshit. We're going
into town.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.432
-Hi.
-Hi, yourself.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.900
- Nice store you got.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.837
-It don't belong to me.
-Still nice though.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.240
<i> Tison</i>
<i> and greenawalt</i>

20:09.242 --> 20:10.675
<i> are both serving</i>
<i> life sentences</i>

20:10.677 --> 20:13.277
<i> for aggravated assault</i>
<i> and murder.</i>

20:13.279 --> 20:15.613
Let's get our
stuff and go.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.649
You got any
full flavored kings?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.817
Just reckon I do.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.855
<i> These men are all armed</i>
<i> and dangerous.</i>

20:29.728 --> 20:32.496
-She smiled at me.
-You can have her.
Ugly old thing.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.631
You think she was ugly?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.499
Unless you like a girl
with a mustache.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.368
Hey, look at this.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.509
Guess... guess we'll have
to change it.

20:50.382 --> 20:50.381
Between the three of you,

20:50.383 --> 20:54.352
you don't have the sense
to make sure that we
got a spare?

20:58.991 --> 21:01.292
We got every law man
in the state looking for us

21:01.294 --> 21:03.261
and you tell me this
is the best you could do?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.996
-Sorry, sir.
-Shut the fuck up.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.265
-It's my fault, sir.
-Shut the fuck up.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.004
All right, listen to me.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.711
We cannot bear
the weight

21:20.713 --> 21:22.913
-of any more fuck ups,
do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.448
-Do you?
-Yes, sir.

21:33.725 --> 21:34.825
Fuck!

21:38.063 --> 21:39.697
What are you looking
at, Donnie?

21:40.866 --> 21:41.999
Ray, it's gonna
be all right.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.068
I know that.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.671
We keep driving till
we find a car with a spare.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.539
-Maybe there's a garage
somewhere--
-hey, hey.

21:50.842 --> 21:52.343
We'll do what Gary says.

21:54.713 --> 21:57.014
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Hi, Dorothy tison?

21:57.482 --> 21:57.481
<i> Yes.</i>

21:57.483 --> 22:01.585
Hello, my name
is Marissa Fuller,
i am a reporter. We--

22:03.955 --> 22:05.356
uh, Mrs. tison?

22:06.892 --> 22:07.925
Hello?

22:10.095 --> 22:11.095
Damn.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.978
-Can I help you?
-Looking for warden Blackwell.

22:27.980 --> 22:27.978
He's otherwise occupied.

22:27.980 --> 22:31.849
Well, you tell him
that John Cooper's here
to see him.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.017
He'll know who it is.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.086
I'll see what I can do.

22:35.088 --> 22:35.086
Do that, son.

22:37.489 --> 22:39.457
Ain't this the shit end
of the stick.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.658
What do you know about it?

22:40.660 --> 22:40.658
Well, what is there to know?

22:40.660 --> 22:44.061
Tison and this other asshole
greenawalt, they

22:44.063 --> 22:46.664
waltzed on out of here,
like Fred and ginger.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.099
- Made me look a goddamn--

22:49.101 --> 22:50.067
a moment.

22:50.902 --> 22:51.936
Blackwell.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.940
Well, go ahead and get it done.
Get it done right.

22:56.675 --> 22:59.643
And right means quiet.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.513
So maybe you thought
it was a good reason
why these boys

23:02.515 --> 23:04.515
were in the playground
and not in the big house

23:04.517 --> 23:05.950
under lock and key?

23:05.952 --> 23:08.119
Hear me, these boys
you're talking about,

23:08.121 --> 23:09.754
they had a record
of civility.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.156
And we had us a riot
in here last year.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.624
And these boys,

23:13.626 --> 23:15.126
they abstained
from the antics

23:15.128 --> 23:17.128
of their fellow inmates.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.463
Yeah, when they had asked
for a transfer sometime ago,

23:19.465 --> 23:21.899
the transfer was granted,
so we moved them.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.603
So this is standard procedure
for murder one felons, is it?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.405
--Never mind.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.641
Did you take a look
at the visitor logs?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.543
"Visitor logs"?
It was his boys.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.978
It was tison's bastards

23:33.980 --> 23:35.146
that took 'em on
out of here.

23:35.148 --> 23:35.146
Anybody else?

23:35.148 --> 23:37.915
What do you mean?
What are you getting at?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.884
I mean you said
he waltzed out of here.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.186
I wanna of there's anybody
else on the dance card.

23:42.188 --> 23:45.423
I don't know if I like
your tone, all right, sir.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.558
I mean, these men were armed,

23:47.560 --> 23:49.827
and my men did not abet,
they did not abide

23:49.829 --> 23:51.796
and I will swear to that
on a stack of bibles

23:51.798 --> 23:51.796
from here to bisbee.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.665
Well, nobody puts
something like this together

23:54.667 --> 23:56.867
without somebody
else knowing about it.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.037
Now did you talk to any
of tison's cell mates?

24:00.939 --> 24:02.006
You did?

24:03.175 --> 24:05.743
Jesus, you knew about this.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.012
There was this little
fellow named tuscon.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.849
And he came in here,
sputtered about some
tall tale.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.551
You know all fits and starts,

24:13.553 --> 24:15.886
and it just did not make
a lick of sense.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.689
All right, yes. I knew.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.992
I knew they was fixing
to be moved by the end
of the next week.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.894
But you know, you start
listening to rumors,

24:23.896 --> 24:26.797
you start listening
to cell talk, block talk,

24:26.799 --> 24:29.033
you're gonna end up chasing
your own butt.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.634
Or preventing a jail break.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.572
Hindsight is 50-50,
isn't it?

24:34.574 --> 24:35.773
Now you wanna go
after these men,

24:35.775 --> 24:35.773
and you wanna
find these men,

24:35.775 --> 24:39.243
I suggest you go on out
there and look for them.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.479
Because I do know
one thing for damn certain.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.214
They're not here.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.584
I wanna see the visitor logs.

25:08.073 --> 25:11.842
Mrs. tison, I want to ask
about your husband Gary.
Your son--

25:21.786 --> 25:22.820
what do you want?

25:24.256 --> 25:25.789
I brought you a whole one.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.191
Tennessee lemon.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.627
Turns out they are not
Tennessee lemons,

25:29.629 --> 25:30.761
just regular ones.

25:32.797 --> 25:33.998
All right, come in.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.008
What do you want, miss?

25:44.010 --> 25:46.243
-Just to talk.
-You're one of them.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.745
Marissa Fuller. Yeah.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.313
I cover crime and courts
for the paper.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.081
You honestly think I want
my name in the paper,

25:51.083 --> 25:53.984
or my picture on TV?
I do not.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.719
I'll know with your
side of the story.

25:55.721 --> 25:56.954
And what story would that be?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.188
The truth.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.590
It's the easiest
thing to remember.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.262
You think they want
the truth?

26:05.264 --> 26:07.965
I can't answer for them.
Only for myself.

26:07.967 --> 26:11.201
To be stuck in here
like a caged animal.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.937
I should go to a motel.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.773
I could take you.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.175
Well, I wouldn't put you
to that trouble.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.877
No trouble at all, dor.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.748
I always wanted a daughter
and I never had one.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.585
How old are you,
like, 20 or 22?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.153
I am 23.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.355
That's older than my Donnie,
but not by much.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.023
He is a good boy.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.793
I'd like to hear about him.

26:44.202 --> 26:46.236
Well?

26:46.238 --> 26:48.339
It's half way
to Jefferson's note.

26:48.341 --> 26:49.740
It's Washington, Rick.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.810
Fuck Washington.
What kinda tire is it?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.812
Uh, so whitewall,
ain't it?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.280
I see that.
What make is it?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.015
Is it a goodyear?
Is it a firestone?

26:58.783 --> 27:00.050
It's a bfgoodrich, dad.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.118
What difference
does it make?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.653
Makes a world
of difference, son.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.288
Now that's a good tire,
bfgoodrich.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.056
-Yeah.
-It's not that
jap piece shit.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.360
You wanna give uncle Joe
another day?

27:10.328 --> 27:11.729
Maybe, they already got
to him.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.832
-That plane ain't coming.
-Shit.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.736
We're moving out tonight.
We drive while it's cool.

27:19.838 --> 27:22.239
Load this shit up.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.109
I'll kill that son of a bitch
when he shows his stupid face.

27:27.812 --> 27:28.912
Come on.

27:29.347 --> 27:31.281
Let's go.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.817
Get all that food
and shit, load it up.

27:33.819 --> 27:34.952
Come on, Rick.

28:02.714 --> 28:04.782
There.
So handsome.

28:06.751 --> 28:06.750
Cute.

28:06.752 --> 28:11.822
I can't imagine what it must
have been like to raise these
boys without a father.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.224
You calling them bastards?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.993
I am sorry,
that's not what I meant.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.194
I know what you meant.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.263
That he was away from home.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.864
That's a fine way
of putting it.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.439
Don't mind me. These boys,
they know their daddy

28:28.441 --> 28:30.908
better than most sons
know their fathers.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.776
That's why they did
what they did.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.878
Out of love
for an innocent man.

28:36.247 --> 28:39.383
You love them.
I can see that.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.452
This is going
to be an interview
or isn't it?

28:41.454 --> 28:42.820
I don't know where
to begin.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.403
Fuck. Fuck.
Mother fucker.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.338
-All right. All right.
-Mother fucker.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.407
-God dammit. Yeah.
-I am pulling over.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.745
Come on. Come on.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.216
God dammit.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.784
God dammit.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.085
Son of a bitch!

29:24.929 --> 29:29.266
<i> Did you know that</i>
<i> Gary was my first and only?</i>

29:29.268 --> 29:31.235
<i> He really courted me</i>
<i> like a real gentleman.</i>

29:31.237 --> 29:32.936
You met him when
he was in prison.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.338
I went with his sister
to visit him.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.207
Never looked at another
man since.

29:37.209 --> 29:37.207
Why do you think
he got in trouble?

29:37.209 --> 29:40.844
It's a misunderstanding,
as every last one.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.346
My Gary is a good man.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.949
And sometimes good men,
they listen to bad ones.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.985
He was dealt his hand
from the bottom of the deck

29:47.987 --> 29:50.087
and it's been stacked
against him ever since.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.191
Now, cut.

29:56.161 --> 29:58.262
Do you think he's capable
of doing the things they say?

29:58.264 --> 30:00.397
Any man is capable.
That's not the question.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.833
The question is did he?
And we know the answer.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.868
No, he did not.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.371
I read in the file
that he brought the gun
the first time he--

30:07.373 --> 30:09.273
"the file"? What file?

30:09.275 --> 30:10.908
The criminal court file.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.010
In '69,
a prison guard named--

30:13.012 --> 30:15.379
didn't your mother teach
you to not believe everything
you read?

30:16.047 --> 30:17.548
I am sure she did,

30:17.550 --> 30:19.550
but you're young
and you're unwise.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.851
In the ways of things.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.421
What ways are those?

30:24.423 --> 30:27.057
World is full of liars
and scoundrels.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.359
Some of them do
their lying

30:29.361 --> 30:31.228
under the guise of the law.

30:31.230 --> 30:35.065
As if that could give them
cover under god's eyes.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.969
<i> Why do you think my</i>
<i> boys got him out of jail</i>
<i> without a hitch?</i>

30:38.971 --> 30:40.537
<i> Because god was watching it.</i>

30:40.539 --> 30:43.106
<i> And he knows.</i>

30:43.108 --> 30:45.142
<i> And that ought to tell</i>
<i> you everything you need</i>
<i> to know.</i>

30:46.110 --> 30:47.344
<i> You write that down.</i>

31:06.197 --> 31:08.298
-Hey.
-Hey, what's the problem?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
Thank you so much, man,
we got a blown tire

31:10.302 --> 31:11.602
back here, we don't
have a spare.

31:11.604 --> 31:12.536
Yeah.

31:14.072 --> 31:15.372
So why you have the hood up?

31:15.374 --> 31:15.372
Whoa, whoa, hey.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.108
Take it easy, nobody
is going to get hurt,
all right?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.209
-Look, you guys...
-Don't hit her.

31:21.112 --> 31:22.246
Okay, lady.

31:22.981 --> 31:22.980
Get on out.

31:22.982 --> 31:26.483
Let's go, lady. You go
get on that car and join
your man.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.452
Look, mister, I am gonna
do whatever you say.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.320
-Okay.
-You stay there.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.622
So do.

31:31.624 --> 31:33.557
I am not going
without my baby.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.025
That's him in the back seat.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.028
His name is Christopher.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.596
Christopher lyons.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.465
-They got a baby in here.
-All right.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.033
-Come to mama.
-Take him.

31:45.303 --> 31:46.670
Shit.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.405
Now, this is
an innocent child.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.242
He ain't never done
anything to hurt nobody.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.545
So you think about that.

31:57.115 --> 31:58.181
What do you
want to do, Gary?

32:00.518 --> 32:02.486
All right. Get on over there
and get in the backseat

32:02.488 --> 32:04.588
of that Chrysler fifth Avenue.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.390
You too, little sis,
come on out.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.691
Come on, get out,
let's go.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.327
Fuck, we gonna do, Gary?

32:10.329 --> 32:13.397
God damn, why couldn't it
be just some guy
driving by himself?

32:13.399 --> 32:15.465
-Hey, look, we don't want
any trouble, okay?
-Shut up.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.268
Take the car. Or money.
Or whatever else.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.538
There's a 38 in the glove
compartment, there's
a 45 in the truck.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.340
Take them.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.008
Just don't hurt anyone.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.944
Just leave us some water,
and we'll stay here.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.645
Do I look like
i am going to hurt anybody?

32:29.080 --> 32:30.247
No.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.581
No, you don't.

32:31.583 --> 32:31.581
Okay, then.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.351
Now get in the backseat
with your kin.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.285
-Let's go.
-It's okay.

32:35.287 --> 32:35.285
Donnie, you're gonna drive.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.689
Ray, you sit
in the front seat.
You cover him.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.190
Rick, you come with us,

32:40.192 --> 32:42.025
we're gonna
take this car back

32:42.027 --> 32:43.460
to the dirt road
and turn right,

32:43.462 --> 32:45.295
and we'll switch
the cars there. Let's go.

33:09.554 --> 33:11.455
All right, outside,
get on over there.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.656
-Come on, get down.
-Donnie.

33:13.358 --> 33:13.357
You cover them.

33:13.359 --> 33:16.426
I want you to go in there
and get their money,

33:16.428 --> 33:18.295
their guns,
their ids, all that stuff.

33:18.297 --> 33:18.295
Let's go.
Move like you

33:18.297 --> 33:22.165
got the holy ghost, not
like you had a church picnic.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.734
All right, come on.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.435
Get all that shit
in the car.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.204
We ain't got
all fucking night.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.472
You ever used one
of those, kid?

33:29.440 --> 33:31.141
Yeah, I was in the service.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.642
That ain't what
i asked you.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.351
Can you shut that little
fucker up, please?

33:41.353 --> 33:44.321
Listen, mister, we don't know
who you are and we don't care.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.322
-Okay?
-Mommy's here.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.656
What the hell
is he doing?

33:46.658 --> 33:48.258
Ain't easy to kill
a Chrysler.

33:49.727 --> 33:51.228
Is that Maverick
ready to roll?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.362
Yeah, she's ready.

33:53.231 --> 33:55.265
Donnie, load them
up in there.

33:55.267 --> 33:58.268
Hey, mister, listen.
We'll do whatever you want.
Okay?

33:58.270 --> 34:01.171
Just please don't hurt
my family.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.241
Nobody is hurting nobody,
all right? Just relax.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.343
Hey, dad, can i
talk to you for a sec?

34:06.345 --> 34:08.378
We're about to greet
the dawn, Donnie.

34:08.380 --> 34:08.378
Yeah, I know that.

34:08.380 --> 34:12.049
But I need to know what
you're planning on doing
with this family.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.784
Go on.

34:17.522 --> 34:18.789
Get me a jug of water.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.791
Yes, sir.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.132
No, no, no, over here.
Come here.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.380
Get on over there
with your brothers.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.514
Go stand over there.

34:46.516 --> 34:47.583
Go.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.222
What's he saying?

34:52.224 --> 34:53.456
Don't ask.
It's gonna be all right.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.441
Me neither.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.418
Dad, don't.

35:41.205 --> 35:42.405
Well, that's that, then.

35:44.442 --> 35:45.509
Ray, you're driving.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.235
What are you doing up?

36:12.237 --> 36:15.172
Well, I couldn't sleep.
You should go back to bed,
honey.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.274
You want me to make
you some fresh coffee?

36:17.276 --> 36:19.209
No, I just made some.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.677
Hey, you go
and get some sleep.

36:21.379 --> 36:22.579
You wanna talk about it?

36:24.849 --> 36:27.350
You know you can always
talk to me.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.485
Yes, I know that.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.455
A man who runs,

36:32.457 --> 36:35.392
eventually finds he's got
no place to go.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.695
You're gonna get
him, John.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.721
We're moving.
That's what counts.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.557
Amen to that.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.229
You all can either sit
back there and mope,

37:12.231 --> 37:14.731
or you can
go through their things
and pull out the cash,

37:14.733 --> 37:16.299
we're gonna need it.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.938
Hey, dad.
Look at this.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.474
Tyson. Just like us.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.710
But she spells it
with a "y".

37:26.712 --> 37:28.745
You think maybe she's kin?

37:28.747 --> 37:31.681
Joe is the only son
of a bitch in this family
that uses a "y".

37:31.683 --> 37:34.751
He changed it because
he thought he was better
than us.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.386
You didn't
have to kill them.

37:36.388 --> 37:36.386
Do what now?

37:36.388 --> 37:39.522
Like you said, we're moving
is what counts, right?

37:39.524 --> 37:41.424
You didn't have
to kill them.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.593
You wanna lay blame on that,
you blame Joe.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.662
He's the one that got us
a goddamn Chrysler

37:45.664 --> 37:47.364
without a goddamn spare.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.300
They were witnesses.
They could've ID'd us.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.035
The baby is gonna
fucking ID us?

37:52.037 --> 37:54.471
Look, your dad did that
little bastard a favor.

37:54.473 --> 37:54.471
You wanna grow up
without a mom and dad?

37:54.473 --> 37:57.807
Yeah, I'd want to grow up
actually, you son of a bitch.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.943
You know what, why don't
you just come over here
and say that?

37:59.945 --> 37:59.943
Fuck you, Randy.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.947
Hey, shut your mouths
and hand me the cash.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.720
Don't ever talk about
that baby again.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.937
Hi, Joe.

38:28.673 --> 38:29.706
Hot damn.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.708
I was gonna call you.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.476
Yeah, I bet you were.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.316
I'm telling you,
that bastard hates me,

38:39.318 --> 38:40.817
and I ain't been hiding
or hear of him.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.752
Is that so?

38:42.754 --> 38:46.056
Swear to god, first I knew of
this was seeing it on the TV.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.791
Gary don't talk to me.

38:47.793 --> 38:47.791
You know how he is.

38:47.793 --> 38:52.862
Well, maybe you can help me
find out who he's been
talking to.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.598
Now, holler if a name
rings a bell.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.601
-Look, Cooper, I don't know
shit about that, all right?
-Hey, Joe.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.070
Now you want parole
violation away

39:00.072 --> 39:02.505
from a semester at the college.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.407
Now you wanna help me,
or I can see that you get

39:04.409 --> 39:06.343
some more time to work
on your degree.

39:07.912 --> 39:10.347
He ever mentioned greenawalt
to you?

39:10.349 --> 39:12.549
No. Like I said,
we don't talk.

39:13.784 --> 39:14.851
Have a look.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.094
Oh, I come and see him
with Dorothy and the boys
and this

39:24.096 --> 39:25.862
court appointed lawyer
when he had one.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.997
If he's out there much longer
without getting caught,

39:27.999 --> 39:30.767
he's gonna let bygones be
and pick up the phone.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.002
When he does,
you better call me.

39:35.573 --> 39:36.606
Here.

39:38.442 --> 39:40.610
Know this Simmons women?

39:40.612 --> 39:41.945
Greenawalt's have
but one visitor.

39:43.447 --> 39:44.881
Maybe she can
tell you something.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.955
<i> Lady's name</i>
<i> is Carolyn Simmons.</i>

39:54.760 --> 39:56.025
<i> Copy that, on the way.</i>

39:58.896 --> 39:59.963
Walk a dock.

40:01.165 --> 40:02.565
That'll work for now.

40:05.035 --> 40:07.504
Sorry you boys had
to see that. That's...

40:08.139 --> 40:09.506
Never should've happened.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.675
I didn't intend for that.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.979
The whole thing,
he gets an idea,

40:15.981 --> 40:18.081
you gotta let him finish
or you'll not hear the end.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.884
I promise you.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.752
We're going to shake Randy
once we get to Mexico.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.721
All right?

40:24.723 --> 40:24.721
-I'll get more paint.
-No.

40:24.723 --> 40:28.691
We ain't got no time.
We're going to get us
a better ride.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.794
Every cop in the state is
coming to look for this
piece of shit.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.731
Are you done
wiping your ass?

40:34.733 --> 40:36.433
You're in a batters
box house.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.767
What? What did I do?

40:40.504 --> 40:44.207
Well, it's not what you did,
it's what you're gonna do.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.042
You're gonna take Donnie
and Ricky and go
into town

40:46.044 --> 40:48.211
see that lady friend of yours,
and get us that truck.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.646
- All right?
- -Yeah.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.081
Let's go get a truck.

41:01.992 --> 41:03.760
Right here.
Stop right here.

41:07.031 --> 41:08.998
Now, hold up.
Which one's hers?

41:09.000 --> 41:08.998
It's that one
there, I think.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.602
Since she ain't home,
how are we gonna get the keys?

41:12.604 --> 41:14.571
Life's full of lessons,
ain't it, kid?

41:15.906 --> 41:17.807
Come on out and get
some teaching, boy.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.110
Wait, where are you going?

41:21.112 --> 41:23.246
No, you sit there.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.881
Ricky is going to school
today.

41:27.084 --> 41:28.585
It's okay, Donnie.

41:28.587 --> 41:29.519
Come on.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.755
All right. Ready to learn
something?

41:32.757 --> 41:34.724
Valuable lessons
to be learned, kid.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.195
You can have anything
you want in this world...

41:39.197 --> 41:40.630
As long as you know
how to steal it.

41:43.033 --> 41:46.035
Abra... cadabra.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.637
All right?

41:47.639 --> 41:49.138
This next little magic trick

41:50.508 --> 41:53.243
I learned in truck stops.

41:55.579 --> 41:57.947
There we go.
Pop that.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.183
Open sesame.
After you, son.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.220
Open the other side for me,
will you?

42:05.890 --> 42:05.889
Thank you, sir.

42:05.891 --> 42:09.559
You ready to learn some shit
they're never gonna teach you

42:09.561 --> 42:10.760
-in school?
-Yeah.

42:11.762 --> 42:13.696
No. Yes, sir.

42:13.698 --> 42:16.566
Treat me with the same respect
you treat your old daddy,
all right?

42:17.535 --> 42:18.568
Yes, sir.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.703
Good man. Now hold that up.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.941
Now the thing is,
with these key holes,

42:24.943 --> 42:27.944
you can treat them nice
and kind and tell them lies

42:27.946 --> 42:29.879
and feed them candy
and all that shit.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.015
But sometimes it's just
not gonna cut it.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.918
Sometimes, like now,

42:34.920 --> 42:37.554
it's just gonna
be a stubborn old thing.

42:38.589 --> 42:39.789
Shit.

42:41.692 --> 42:42.725
Like your brother
over there.

42:44.295 --> 42:45.795
Sitting in the car.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.730
Watching us like a hawk.

42:47.732 --> 42:48.965
Hey, Donnie.

42:51.702 --> 42:52.902
Stubborn old thing.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.337
Anyway,

42:55.606 --> 42:58.908
trick to breaking
a bad pony here is,

42:58.910 --> 43:01.144
I am telling you, he's not
gonna give you what you want.

43:02.613 --> 43:05.715
Then you just have to...

43:05.717 --> 43:06.849
- Ram it home.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.086
Bingo.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.789
Dammit.

43:58.068 --> 44:00.236
-Carolyn Simmons?
-Who's asking?

44:00.238 --> 44:01.404
Arizona state police.

44:03.107 --> 44:05.241
-I am Carolyn.
-Yeah? You know this guy?

44:06.944 --> 44:06.943
What did Randy do?

44:06.945 --> 44:10.747
-You've seen him?
-A couple of weeks ago
up at the prison.

44:10.749 --> 44:13.082
-Nonsense.
-If you got
nothing else, mister,

44:13.084 --> 44:14.984
I got my papers to deliver.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.386
It's lieutenant, ma'am.

44:16.388 --> 44:17.754
You mind if I take
a look around?

44:25.396 --> 44:27.797
Password.
That's a good one.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.904
You deliver these papers
without reading them?

44:34.906 --> 44:36.673
You've seen his face
on the front page, huh?

44:36.675 --> 44:38.074
Just dear Abby
and the horoscopes.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.145
What's your relationship
with greenawalt?

44:42.147 --> 44:44.247
-"Relationship"?
-You visit him regular.

44:44.249 --> 44:46.883
Well, he was kinda my boy
when he got set up.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.785
Started writing me letters.

44:48.787 --> 44:51.454
-He wouldn't hurt nobody.
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.856
Well, you hear from him,
i hear from you.

44:53.858 --> 44:54.824
You understand?

44:54.826 --> 44:56.826
Well, what should I tell him?

44:56.828 --> 44:57.994
Will he listen to you?

44:59.129 --> 45:00.363
I suspect so.

45:01.265 --> 45:02.432
Tell him to turn
himself in.

45:04.868 --> 45:05.868
You have a good one.

45:21.485 --> 45:23.252
What do you think?
Hard as she gets, yeah?

45:23.254 --> 45:24.721
Four by four, like you asked.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.723
It got no camper.

45:28.358 --> 45:29.892
It's solid.
It's a good truck, dad.

45:29.894 --> 45:30.927
Damn good truck.

45:32.196 --> 45:34.997
Now, how about we all of us
go sit in that truck?

45:37.334 --> 45:39.736
And put them
dime card punches away, boy.

45:39.738 --> 45:40.937
You know what's good for you.

45:47.778 --> 45:50.747
But you said your old lady
had a truck with a camper.

45:50.749 --> 45:52.515
Tell her you're at camp.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.484
It's going to be fine, Gary.

45:54.486 --> 45:56.352
Shit, just let the boys
ride in the back.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.189
I want ray upfront
with me and Ricky.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.325
Donnie, pull that seat
out of the Maverick
and ride back there

46:02.327 --> 46:03.526
like a couple of mascots.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.277
-You're the one
who wrote this?
-Jesus Christ!

46:21.279 --> 46:23.913
What are you doing
writing something
like this?

46:23.915 --> 46:26.215
You want to get people feeling
sorry for these animals?

46:26.217 --> 46:27.784
It's called an interview.

46:27.786 --> 46:29.519
Has she been in touch
with any of these boys?

46:29.521 --> 46:31.154
-No.
-"No"?

46:32.422 --> 46:33.956
I don't know.
I don't think so.

46:35.192 --> 46:36.926
You know, impeding

46:36.928 --> 46:39.495
a criminal investigation
is a punishable offense.

46:39.497 --> 46:42.465
I expect you know this
is the usa, we have
a free press.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.500
Mm-hmm.

46:44.502 --> 46:46.903
I don't know what you're
playing here.

46:46.905 --> 46:48.337
I don't think you
know either.

46:48.339 --> 46:49.539
I am just doing my job, sir.

46:50.307 --> 46:51.240
Well...

46:52.376 --> 46:53.910
If you hear anything,

46:54.444 --> 46:55.878
you better call me.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.853
Fuck.

47:05.889 --> 47:08.424
-Hey, you sleeping?
-No.

47:08.426 --> 47:09.525
Just thinking.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.062
Yeah. Me, too.

47:15.999 --> 47:18.000
I don't like
what they've done.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.136
They had no reason
killing anybody.

47:20.138 --> 47:23.039
I wasn't thinking nothing
against dad.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.440
I was just thinking
about Mexico.

47:30.948 --> 47:32.281
Who is keeping watch?

47:32.283 --> 47:33.349
I am, sir.

47:34.518 --> 47:35.852
What's Donnie doing here?

47:35.854 --> 47:37.320
Nothing, I just went
to take a piss,

47:37.322 --> 47:39.555
figured I'd keep ray company.

47:39.557 --> 47:43.359
No, I need you rested up.
You're driving tomorrow.

47:43.361 --> 47:46.596
Besides I don't want you guys
splitting off in commissary.
Understand?

47:47.231 --> 47:48.364
Just talk is all.

47:49.933 --> 47:53.302
Donnie said we got no reason
to kill that family.

47:58.475 --> 48:00.977
Listen to me.
I told you boys,

48:02.012 --> 48:03.512
what happened back there,

48:03.514 --> 48:05.114
it was Randy's idea.

48:07.317 --> 48:08.651
It's not the way
i wanted it to go.

48:09.486 --> 48:10.519
Yes, sir.

48:14.091 --> 48:16.292
You ever know me to hurt
anybody didn't ask for it?

48:17.895 --> 48:19.128
Is that the way
you were raised?

48:21.365 --> 48:23.966
You think I am some dog
that needs to be put down?

48:25.969 --> 48:27.236
No, sir.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.972
Then don't talk like I was.

48:29.974 --> 48:32.041
And don't poison your
brothers against me.

48:35.112 --> 48:36.145
Go.

48:44.054 --> 48:45.187
What else he say?

48:45.689 --> 48:46.989
Nothing, sir.

48:49.192 --> 48:50.526
You're doing a good job, ray.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.665
I think this whole thing
is gonna work out
because you are here.

48:56.967 --> 48:58.134
Thank you, sir.

49:06.243 --> 49:07.443
Stay alert.

49:09.179 --> 49:10.313
Stay awake.

49:14.551 --> 49:15.985
<i> I hear riders.</i>

49:27.965 --> 49:27.964
Hey.

49:27.966 --> 49:32.535
I tried calling, but all i
got was a busy signal.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.103
-Thank you.
-For what?

49:35.405 --> 49:37.006
That was a real
nice story you wrote.

49:37.008 --> 49:38.975
There are two sides
to every story.

49:38.977 --> 49:40.409
Your side needed
to be told.

49:40.411 --> 49:42.345
Come in, sit down.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.054
I got a call today.

49:52.056 --> 49:54.590
-Oh.
-Do you know
Mary Joe west?

49:55.525 --> 49:55.524
-On TV?
-Mm-hmm.

49:55.526 --> 49:59.295
Her people called me.
They want me to come
into the station tomorrow

49:59.297 --> 50:00.763
and do an interview.

50:00.765 --> 50:02.465
Do you want to?

50:02.467 --> 50:05.134
Well, there's a lot of people
who want to talk to me,

50:05.136 --> 50:06.602
and I expect I need
someone to help.

50:09.206 --> 50:10.573
-I'll call her.
-Good.

50:17.214 --> 50:19.015
You didn't hear
from anyone else?

50:19.017 --> 50:20.282
-Like who?
-The boys.

50:20.650 --> 50:22.084
Your husband.

50:22.086 --> 50:23.319
Don't you think I'd tell you?

50:25.055 --> 50:26.122
Yeah.

50:29.393 --> 50:33.262
<i> Dorothy, how often would you</i>
<i> and the boys visit Gary</i>
<i> in jail?</i>

50:33.264 --> 50:35.231
<i> We go every Sunday.</i>

50:35.233 --> 50:38.167
<i> Every week</i>
<i> you went to prison?</i>

50:38.169 --> 50:40.036
<i> Well, yeah, sometimes when</i>
<i> the boys got older</i>

50:40.038 --> 50:42.738
<i> they would drive themselves,</i>
<i> they go earlier or later.</i>

50:42.740 --> 50:46.208
<i> But every Sunday,</i>
<i> because boys need Jesus,</i>

50:46.210 --> 50:47.643
<i> and boys need their father.</i>

50:47.645 --> 50:49.245
What the fuck
is she doing?

50:49.247 --> 50:51.080
Shut up, I am watching this.

50:51.082 --> 50:53.582
<i> So, your boys have</i>
<i> already spent</i>

50:53.584 --> 50:53.582
<i> a good deal of time</i>
<i> in prison.</i>

50:53.584 --> 50:57.086
<i> Well, that's where their</i>
<i> dad was, at least,</i>

50:57.088 --> 50:58.320
<i> until last week.</i>

50:59.556 --> 51:00.756
<i> Are you proud</i>
<i> of your children?</i>

51:02.325 --> 51:04.226
<i> You don't have children,</i>
<i> do you, Mary Joe?</i>

51:04.228 --> 51:06.262
<i> May I call you Mary Joe?</i>

51:06.264 --> 51:07.530
Bitch should shut
her mouth.

51:07.532 --> 51:10.099
-Shush!
-They gave him
two life sentences.

51:10.101 --> 51:12.468
Even if he died, they
weren't going to let him out.

51:12.470 --> 51:14.370
She should've left his ass,
married someone else.

51:14.372 --> 51:16.105
I can't hear what
she's saying.

51:16.107 --> 51:18.207
So what I am saying
ain't important?

51:24.347 --> 51:25.648
Yeah.

51:25.650 --> 51:25.648
What the fuck
happened in hyner?

51:25.650 --> 51:29.318
-Jesus, man.
-Now's not the time
for praying.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.320
<i> Where the hell are you?</i>

51:33.256 --> 51:35.191
-Is this phone tapped?
<i> -No.</i>

51:35.193 --> 51:35.191
It's okay.

51:35.193 --> 51:40.529
Okay, good, 'cause I don't
have the time or the change
for anymore bullshit.

51:40.531 --> 51:43.332
Like the way you left us
back there with our dicks
in our hands.

51:43.334 --> 51:45.234
-Listen, Gary--
<i> -you listen to me.</i>

51:45.236 --> 51:46.869
<i> I need you to get</i>
<i> us a plane,</i>

51:46.871 --> 51:48.404
and meet us in new mex.

51:48.406 --> 51:50.606
You know the state,
you know the strips.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.341
I want you to
get us a plane,

51:52.343 --> 51:54.376
and get us across
the border today.

51:54.378 --> 51:55.578
<i> New Mexico?</i>

51:55.580 --> 51:57.146
Ain't you in hyner no more?

51:57.148 --> 52:00.416
Old gal that Randy knows
got us a truck.

52:00.418 --> 52:03.652
Which is more than i
can say for my own
god damned brother.

52:03.654 --> 52:05.821
Listen to me, Gary.
I can't get involved in this.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.823
You're already involved,
you dumbfuck.

52:07.825 --> 52:09.291
Well, I need more time.

52:09.293 --> 52:10.693
You and me,
we ain't got no more time.

52:10.695 --> 52:12.394
Now you going to help
me or not?

52:13.697 --> 52:15.664
Are the boys all right?

52:15.666 --> 52:17.833
They're right as rain.

52:17.835 --> 52:19.768
Now you're gonna put
paid to this or not?

52:21.471 --> 52:22.805
There's a crop duster strip.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.507
<i> Over the border in clovis.</i>

52:24.509 --> 52:26.375
Okay, I'll be there
in 24 hours.

52:26.377 --> 52:27.877
<i> Listen to me, Gary.</i>

52:27.879 --> 52:29.478
The plane I am thinking of,

52:29.480 --> 52:31.447
there's only enough room
for two more.

52:31.449 --> 52:31.447
<i> -Gary.</i>
-Yeah.

52:31.449 --> 52:35.684
Let them boys go about
their business, they've done
all they could.

52:35.686 --> 52:35.684
You just meet me there.

52:35.686 --> 52:39.288
I am gonna try, but you're
asking the near impossible.

52:39.290 --> 52:41.190
Near ain't the thing.

52:41.192 --> 52:43.325
Don't fuck me again, Joe.
You hear me?

52:58.808 --> 53:00.676
Why did you get mixed up in?

53:00.678 --> 53:03.345
- <i> Sheriff's office.</i>
- Let me talk to Cooper.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.247
- <i> This is Cooper.</i>
- It's Joe.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.484
That woman visited greenawalt,
gave him a truck.

53:23.233 --> 53:24.633
All right, spread out.

53:25.235 --> 53:26.335
You guys out.

53:26.736 --> 53:28.637
Carolyn Simmons.

53:28.639 --> 53:30.606
Arizona state police.
Come on out.

53:33.643 --> 53:36.679
-Miss Simmons, where
is Randy greenawalt?
-Son of a bitch.

53:36.681 --> 53:39.348
I got no idea what
you're talking about.

53:39.350 --> 53:42.351
Mm-hmm. Well, I am disinclined
to believe you, ma'am.

53:42.353 --> 53:45.788
Just tell me where he is,
or I will have you both
for aiding and abetting.

53:45.790 --> 53:48.824
All I know is they
took my old truck.

53:48.826 --> 53:50.459
Surprised the damn
thing started.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.428
Thing ain't worked right
since uncle Ben died.

53:52.430 --> 53:53.629
What direction
were they headed?

53:53.631 --> 53:55.798
I don't have
any earthly idea.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.900
-Just one vehicle?
-I am telling you.

53:58.501 --> 53:59.568
I don't know.

54:00.470 --> 54:01.870
I'm gonna talk to a lawyer.

54:03.773 --> 54:05.674
Ketchum,
accommodate the lady.

54:06.610 --> 54:08.444
All right, Carolyn,
let's go.

54:08.446 --> 54:09.812
Let's go, come on.

54:11.848 --> 54:13.916
You've got the right
to remain silent.

54:41.345 --> 54:42.344
Where are we going?

54:47.817 --> 54:49.018
I got to go make some water.

54:54.057 --> 54:55.891
You don't like me much,
do you, kid?

54:56.660 --> 54:57.826
That's okay.

54:58.995 --> 55:00.729
Fact is I don't like
you much either.

55:02.932 --> 55:05.701
Tell you the truth, I'd shoot
you just as soon as look
at you.

55:07.837 --> 55:09.738
You wouldn't say that
if he was here.

55:09.740 --> 55:10.673
That's what you think.

55:11.374 --> 55:12.574
You don't know that.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.046
I won't though.
Shoot you, I mean.

55:17.048 --> 55:19.348
'Cause you and I,
we're have us a bond.

55:19.350 --> 55:22.451
No, I ain't got nothing
to do with you.

55:22.819 --> 55:23.952
Oh, yeah, you do.

55:24.688 --> 55:24.687
We got a bond.
We got--

55:24.689 --> 55:29.391
if nothing else we're bound
by our mutual dislike
for one another.

55:30.694 --> 55:31.994
Bound by
the bed of this truck.

55:33.530 --> 55:36.031
You and I hop
this ride together.

55:36.033 --> 55:38.734
And we're damn sure gonna
jump together when the time
comes.

55:39.803 --> 55:42.438
It can't come soon enough
for me, asshole.

55:45.975 --> 55:48.944
How is it your dad
is so smart,

55:48.946 --> 55:51.714
and you're just
so fucking stupid?

55:55.452 --> 55:56.452
Dipshit.

56:48.538 --> 56:51.473
You promise me you'll see
to my safety and the safety
of my family?

56:51.475 --> 56:53.709
Patrol cars are watching
your house and wife.

56:53.711 --> 56:53.709
Just stay put
in that motel.

56:53.711 --> 56:59.014
I mean it. I want to know
you're not gonna screw it up
this whole...

56:59.016 --> 57:01.617
Spruce goose chase go south,
he'll kill me dead.

57:01.619 --> 57:02.951
You just hold up
your end,

57:02.953 --> 57:05.020
do as I say,

57:05.022 --> 57:07.623
and you can spend all day
riding in the front seat
of your car

57:07.625 --> 57:07.623
and not sitting
in the back of mine.

57:07.625 --> 57:11.160
You think I like walking
around with a target
on my back?

57:11.162 --> 57:12.694
I want him caught more
than any of you all.

57:12.696 --> 57:12.694
- <i> John Cooper?</i>
- Cooper.

57:12.696 --> 57:17.099
<i> The bodies of three persons,</i>
<i> two adults, one child,</i>

57:17.101 --> 57:20.602
<i>have been found in the desert.</i>
<i> Multiple gun shot wounds.</i>

57:20.604 --> 57:22.504
<i> Blood trail leaving</i>
<i> the scene indicates</i>

57:22.506 --> 57:25.607
<i> possible fourth victim</i>
<i> may still be alive.</i>

57:25.609 --> 57:27.075
<i> County investigators</i>
<i> believe the car</i>

57:27.077 --> 57:29.211
<i> found at the site,</i>
<i> a Chrysler fifth Avenue,</i>

57:29.213 --> 57:31.914
<i> may have been used</i>
<i> in escape.</i>

57:31.916 --> 57:32.748
-Is that it?
<i> -Yes, sir.</i>

57:37.454 --> 57:38.821
You know anything
about a Chrysler?

57:40.924 --> 57:42.157
I am talking to you, Joe.

57:43.092 --> 57:44.493
I don't know what he'd done.

58:13.156 --> 58:15.557
You know, Gary, it's only
a few hours to the border.

58:15.559 --> 58:18.060
Why the fuck this airplane?
Let's just make a run for it.

58:18.595 --> 58:19.995
No, no, no.

58:20.830 --> 58:22.064
We're going out in style.

58:23.900 --> 58:25.968
We have the truck.

58:25.970 --> 58:27.870
Yeah, well, fuck the truck.

58:27.872 --> 58:29.972
There's nothing but sand
out there and the sun up there.

58:29.974 --> 58:33.642
We're going to be like
bacon on a griddle,
sizzling out there.

58:33.644 --> 58:35.844
There's nothing but thousands
of dead Mexicans out there

58:35.846 --> 58:37.546
thinking the same way you do.

58:37.780 --> 58:38.814
Dad.

58:38.816 --> 58:39.882
Huh?

58:41.618 --> 58:42.818
Give me them field glasses.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.855
My old eyes don't work
like they used to.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.657
-What is it?
-What do you think it is?

58:50.827 --> 58:51.927
My god, it's Joe.

58:53.162 --> 58:54.196
That's Joe!

58:54.764 --> 58:56.565
That's Joe.

58:56.567 --> 58:58.700
I'm not gonna cut him
out of the will just yet.

58:58.868 --> 59:00.202
Dad.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.236
What's that?

59:11.548 --> 59:12.648
No.

59:13.249 --> 59:14.583
Joe.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.954
No, no, no.

59:19.589 --> 59:20.656
No.

59:21.257 --> 59:22.591
Joe.

59:23.960 --> 59:24.993
God dammit.

59:25.828 --> 59:26.962
Joe.

59:27.730 --> 59:28.764
Joe.

59:32.068 --> 59:33.569
You son of a bitch.

59:35.672 --> 59:37.639
Joe!

59:37.641 --> 59:40.075
I am gonna kill you
if it's the last thing
i fucking do.

59:40.910 --> 59:42.578
Fuck you, Joe!

59:43.746 --> 59:44.813
Fuck you!

59:47.150 --> 59:48.584
Fuck you, too.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.157
You know how
to drive, boy, or what?

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:30.659
I am trying, the gears
are stripped.

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:31.860
You sharp shooting me, boy?

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:37.165
Shut the fuck up.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:40.669
<i> There's no</i>
<i> sign of a pick up truck</i>
<i> anywhere near the air strip.</i>

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:44.973
All right.

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:49.077
-Anything?
-No.

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.179
Unconfirmed sighting
of the girl Terry Jo Tyson.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.216
Turned out to be a runaway
from gila bend.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.318
"Gila bend"?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.354
That tison robbed guard
armory up there few
years back.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:01.023
False ID though.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:02.891
No connection to our girl.

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:02.891
You think they took her?

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:06.795
No. No, that's not
tison's thing.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:07.863
What about the boys?

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.398
Randy?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.767
No, I can't
speak for the boys,

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:14.836
but killing a woman isn't
greenawalt's cup of coffee.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.005
No, couple of long hauled
truck drivers.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.074
File said he used to paint
an excellent driver side door

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.876
where he figured their head
would be. Fall asleep.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.679
Right through the door.

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:26.748
What the hell do you
think that means?

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:27.315
Not my department.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:31.086
Well. Neither of 'em
have any trouble in
the killing department.

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:33.055
No.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:34.856
Tison gunned down one
of ours about ten years ago.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.758
His name was stiner.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:41.096
Tison was being transferred

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:44.366
back to prison out of court,
and somehow,

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:47.803
probably that crack wife
of his, he got a gun,

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.172
and he hijacked the driver.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.208
He could've let him go,

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:56.011
driven off, but he shot him.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.315
Left him to die in the mud.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.783
Side of the road.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.287
-You knew him?
-Yeah, he...

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:07.456
He is a good man. Wife.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.826
Children.
He is a friend of mine.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.128
How are we gonna get
him, Coop?

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.163
How are we
gonna bring him in?

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.733
I swore to it.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.763
Why did you
let this happen?

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.000
Why did you
let this happen?

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:53.135
-Why did you
let this happen?
-Dor?

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.905
Why did you
let this happen?

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.874
-How did you
let this happen?
-Hey.

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:00.308
Dor.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.943
Why did you
let this happen?

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.512
Hey, you all right?

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.817
Why did you
let this happen?

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:10.418
I can't understand you.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.220
You're trying to trick me?

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.256
-Trying to make me a fool?
-No, ma'am.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.992
Don't you ma'am me.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:19.528
-Dor... Mrs. tison, i--
-I'm your mother.

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.800
They killed a baby.

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:26.501
Do you know that they
killed a baby boy?

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.504
I don't know why...
Why they would do that.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.339
Let me help you.

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:31.339
No, you get out of here.

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:35.210
You go sell your lies
someplace else.
You just get out.

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.279
Dor...

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.181
Get out!

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.903
Well, did you get them
on or what?

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:03.238
Construction zone over yonder.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.875
You find us a truck
with a transmission
that wouldn't fuck.

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.914
Spit it out, boy.

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.322
I am with you, sir.

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.558
I'm with you all the way.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.594
Yeah, but?

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:27.262
Ricky's just made 17.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.266
And he's got no priors.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:35.971
And a good lawyer can get
him off pretty much
scot free right now.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:38.974
And we wouldn't have
to fight over who rides
in the truck.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:38.974
I hear nobody fighting.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:44.045
Of course not.
Ricky don't complain, dad.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.882
And he'll do
anything you say.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:49.150
You tell him to jump,
he says, "how high, dad?"

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:54.389
Look, you could tell him,
tell the law, we're going
one way

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.324
and we go another.
All right?

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.194
That buys us enough
of a window

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:01.296
to get down to new Mexico.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.265
A place where they ain't
even thinking about looking.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.935
It's been
on your mind a time.

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:08.937
I just don't want
Ricky getting hurt.

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.438
You think I don't
have love for that boy?

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.074
All of you?

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.944
You're the only ones
that matter to me.

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:22.651
You think you got it bad
with your old man?

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.254
Mine used to whip me.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:29.624
Make me work
in the fields

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:31.426
for nothing,
day after day.

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.063
Fuck that.

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:40.001
I am getting what
was taken from me.

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:45.140
Let Ricky go.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.476
Please.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.981
I'd do anything you say,

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:54.382
as long as you let him go.

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.053
All right.

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.222
I'll sleep on it.

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:04.059
You did good coming to me.

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.395
So say nothing
to those others.

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.631
Understand?

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.200
Yes, sir.

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.073
What are we gonna do about
that truck?

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.743
I got no fucking idea.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.234
Did you put out the fire?
We shouldn't leave that.

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:47.168
I'll do it.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:54.642
Ooh!

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:11.793
What do we got going
over here?

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:13.661
So, do we wanna take
the scenic route,

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:15.196
or should we go
through the city?

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.444
-Get back now.
-Fuck.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:30.678
-Shut your face.
-Now.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.247
-Okay.
-Get out of the Van.

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:34.382
Get out of the Van.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.285
- Get in the back.

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.088
Take it easy, all right?

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.089
Shut up.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.229
Please, sir, just let us go.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.697
I got a couple
of hundred dollars

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:51.566
that we were given
as a wedding gift.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.101
We just got married, okay.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:55.470
Just take that and the Van
and let us go.

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:58.373
Please, let us go.
Please.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.775
Like the worst fucking
honeymoon ever, huh?

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.868
Come on. Over there.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:28.670
Go on.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.113
You boys stay here.

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:40.814
We're going to deal
with that couple.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.617
Wait.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.852
Won't be long.

01:08:43.854 --> 01:08:44.853
Gary.

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:51.326
Did you just call me
something other than "sir"?

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:52.894
This is our chance, Ricky.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:53.862
Now we tie them up,

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.499
let him take them up north
as far as he can get
in the truck.

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.667
Let 'em loose up there,
by then we're miles away.

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:00.702
Get back in the truck.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.872
What are you fixing to do
with those people?

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.209
You can't keep me
in the dark anymore.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:09.243
You listen to me.

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:12.447
You remember when you came
to me and told me

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.747
you wanted to drop out
of high school

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.250
and join the service,
you remember that?

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.154
Then you show me
that you can take orders

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:20.388
and get back in that truck.

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:28.930
They're good people.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.430
Sir.

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:33.835
Please.

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:37.238
They ain't no better than me,
or you.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:40.341
Get back in truck.

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:56.457
Turn it off, Donnie.

01:09:56.459 --> 01:10:00.295
Ray, we are getting
out of here right now.

01:10:00.297 --> 01:10:01.829
Dad's lost his goddamn mind,

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:04.265
and that greenawalt
is a piece
of shit, all right.

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:05.567
You wanna stick around
for the killing?

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:06.668
He'll start with me.

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.970
Ray, don't.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:10.438
Just put it down.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.307
Dad says it was all
Randy's doing.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.475
Dad didn't have nothing
to do with killing
that family.

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:15.543
What is the matter
with you, ray?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.312
You saw it with your
own eyes.

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.681
What, you believe
everything he says? Huh?

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.683
Wake up, ray.

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:23.518
Dad isn't
who you think he is.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.454
Maybe he never was.

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.391
Turn off the truck, boy.

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.228
Step on out.

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:41.903
Walk.

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.277
I mean, he is just
gonna tie him up.

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:52.013
He said he doesn't want us
talking when he is not
around.

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:53.314
We are just talking.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:54.582
And that's
what he don't want.

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.421
Follow them.

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:02.557
Go.

01:11:15.538 --> 01:11:17.705
Guess, he didn't say nothing
about not singing.

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:51.773
I like it here.
What do you think?

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.475
It's good. I like it.

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:56.577
Hey, let go of him.

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:57.979
Let go now.

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.447
Go on. Go on.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:01.582
-You go over there.
-You got him.

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:03.551
-All right.
-I got her, all right.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:04.652
Let's go, come on.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.487
Let's go.
Come on, Donnie.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.655
All right, go this way.

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.758
-Margene!
-Shut the fuck up.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.394
Now go over there.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:22.937
You don't have to do this.

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:24.672
Oh, my god.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.107
Just stop right there,
will you?

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:31.846
No!

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.523
You wanna lay it down
right here, go ahead.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.127
I'll ask you questions
one way or the other.

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.597
No, sir.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:52.467
I am the only law
that you got to worry about.

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:56.537
The law of fathers
over sons.

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.542
And there ain't no escaping
that but by this.

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:07.648
Come here.

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.886
Don't you ever...

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.654
Defy me again.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:16.858
It's your last chance.

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.026
This is Cooper.

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:53.528
<i> Hello.</i>

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:53.528
Who is this?

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:57.064
<i> It's Marissa Fuller,</i>
<i> from</i> flagstaff sun.

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:03.037
You wanted to see me?

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.973
Yeah, thank you for coming.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.576
Oh, all right.
All right, thank you.

01:14:08.578 --> 01:14:10.645
-Coffee?
-Oh, yes, thank you.

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.080
See a menu?

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.683
No, just coffee is fine,
thanks.

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:19.487
So, what do you wanna say?

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.189
She is out of her mind.

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:23.191
Dorothy tison?

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:24.192
Yeah.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.561
I could've told you that.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:27.695
I mean about the baby.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.597
And other things, too.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:29.597
I guess, but listen,
she really thinks

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:33.034
those boys got mixed up
in this without knowing
the truth.

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.737
-Truth about what?
-About Gary.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:39.607
I mean, those boys believed
everything they were ever
fed about him.

01:14:39.609 --> 01:14:41.742
Most of it by her,
ever since they were little.

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.879
And now,
she is out of her mind.

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:44.879
What's this have to do
with anything?

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:49.550
I think I can get her
to talk them into turning
themselves in.

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:50.952
What makes you think that?

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.787
She trusts me.

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.755
What, are you two
mother and daughter now?

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:57.925
Did I say something funny?

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.627
No.

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.730
Look.

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.600
She is crazy.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.802
But I don't think she wants
to see anybody else dead.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.837
Least of all her boys.

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:11.739
I don't either.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.108
All right.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:16.777
Well, anything happens,
you holler.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:18.613
What, that's it?

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.016
There's one more thing.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.552
I'd hazard to say that

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:26.687
somebody as young as you

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.656
hasn't come across
real evil

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:29.657
in their life,

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.927
like Gary tison.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.863
He is a charmer.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.698
Lot of men are.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.034
There's a ready smile
for everyone.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.737
A handshake, everybody
knows his name,

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.008
but behind the handshake
and the smile is a dead thing.

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:49.844
Thing that has no heart.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.281
Thing that...

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:55.750
Get whatever it wants
no matter the cost,

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:57.752
even if it's his own flesh
and blood.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.720
And a man like that

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.123
is a danger to everybody.

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:05.793
Now this family...

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.895
Seen your paper?

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.630
They paid a pretty
heavy price.

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:13.901
And it's on me to see
that nobody else

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.737
has to pay tison's debt
but tison himself.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.676
I'm sorry.

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:24.612
Yeah, well, don't be.

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:27.748
It's just...
I didn't know.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:29.650
Yeah, well...

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.586
Now you do.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:50.671
What are you doing?

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:51.772
What's wrong?

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:53.774
Can't sleep.

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:55.643
What time is it?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.812
It's almost midnight.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:02.216
Forget it. I got to go
by the house.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.620
That's not safe.

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.356
You said so yourself.

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:12.093
I just got to stop by
for a minute, grab something.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.194
Ain't gonna stay there.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:17.365
-I am coming with you.
-Don't.

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:19.066
Would you just leave me
to do what I need to do?

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.771
I said, I am coming.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:35.116
Pull over.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:37.251
That's that son of a bitch
Joe's house.

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.289
Stay put.

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.339
What's the matter, boy?
You all quiet.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.176
You scared?
You're scared, ain't you?

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.978
You're scared
as a fucking fish.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.113
You guys know what a fish is?

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.050
A joint.

01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:10.918
Did you ever hear your dad
talk about that, a fish?

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:14.021
Fish is a newbie,
a first timer.

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.357
Like this one.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:18.159
Wide eyed and fucking scared.

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.406
You having a stroke
or something?

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.009
Why aren't we moving?

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.183
- Oh, my god.
-Shut up.

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:45.019
Just because
you're driving you ain't
the boss, you know.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.287
Just so you know,
i saw you.

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:49.290
Blowing chunks out there
by that girl.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.492
Pussy.

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.095
Jesus.

01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:55.996
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us killed.

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.465
You stupid son of a bitch.

01:18:57.467 --> 01:18:59.166
Shut the fuck up,
for Christ...

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.003
Just let me think.

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:05.039
I was kinda hoping
your dad will put you down.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:06.507
- When you were out there.
-Go!

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.344
We gotta get outta here.

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:17.451
Can't win 'em all though.

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.290
Scared little fishy.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.361
Wants to swim way.

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:31.432
Swim away, little fishy.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:38.773
Was he there?

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:41.976
He holed up somewhere
like the coward that he is.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.844
Let's go.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.147
He's probably
at a fucking bar.

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:48.048
Randy, you get up front,

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:51.452
I am going
to ride in the back
with my boys.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.255
Donnie, you take us downtown
and we'll see what we can see.

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:03.230
Hey, it's me.

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:08.936
You heard something?

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:10.137
I just wanna talk.

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:11.472
Please.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:12.540
You got a cigarette?

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:15.009
I just want to help.

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:16.811
Help me?

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.115
Just like I said,

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:21.115
get a little
schooling in you.

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:26.253
Little book smart with your
words and your story telling,

01:20:26.255 --> 01:20:28.889
you think you sit
at god's right hand.

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.192
Doling out help
to the helpless.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:33.127
Well, you don't know,
you can't see,

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:35.529
but you got no help
to give.

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:38.232
You're just like
the rest of us.

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.367
Helpless.

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.139
If you got a cigarette,
I'll take that.

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:48.576
Otherwise, you can help
yourself right back out to
you car.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:59.253
When did you start smoking
my brand?

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.423
I hope your boys come home.

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:04.959
Where you going?

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:07.494
Far from you.

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.974
I hope your night
is good and quiet.

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:21.075
Hold on, you got a call.

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.279
-Cooper.
-He's here, goddammit.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:27.147
In a two tone Ford econoline,
looking for me.

01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.147
What, say what now?

01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:30.150
I went to my house
and that son of a bitch
was waiting for me,

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:31.151
like I said.

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.587
You promised
to keep me safe.

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:35.923
All right, you stay where i
put you. You understand?

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.025
We'll take care of this.

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:39.093
Goddammit.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.429
Son of a bitch
is on his way home.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:43.931
Get ketchum on the horn,

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.199
get the roadblocks up,

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.401
and have every lawman
from maricopa

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:50.437
to pima county
up and out of bed
in the next 15 minutes.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:57.578
<i> Yeah, yellow</i>
<i> Ford pick up, right?</i>

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:02.182
<i> Scratch that,</i>
<i> you're looking</i>
<i> for two tone econoline Van</i>

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:03.350
<i> with Texas plates.</i>

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.185
Copy that.

01:22:05.187 --> 01:22:07.221
All right, I am heading up
back to the block.

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:09.023
Just let me know
if something comes through.

01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:09.957
All right.

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:32.346
Easy.

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:34.648
Okay, all right.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:35.716
It's a family.

01:22:35.718 --> 01:22:37.051
Bring 'em on, through.

01:22:37.053 --> 01:22:38.118
Come on.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.653
All right, come on.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.659
Got a station wagon
with a family

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:47.194
ahead of the rest
coming your way.

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:58.706
Blood calls to blood.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:01.542
How's that?

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:01.542
That's what you said.

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:06.146
Maybe if you think real
hard you'll know where
uncle Joe is.

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:10.384
Maybe he is just
a crock of shit.

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:13.754
I'll have someone to take care
of your uncle Joe once we
are safe down in Mexico.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:19.026
Maybe I'll come back
and do him my own damn self.

01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:21.362
Right now, we're headed
to the border, boys.

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:27.267
Something's
coming up here.

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:28.635
Head's up. On your toe.

01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:30.104
Oh, Christ. Dad.

01:23:30.106 --> 01:23:31.438
It's a barricade.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.140
Cops.

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.709
Now, how the fuck
did they know?

01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:37.011
Brace yourself, boys.

01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:37.745
What's he doing?

01:23:37.747 --> 01:23:38.679
Steady, boys.

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:45.586
All right, listen to me.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:48.255
-Listen to me.
-Dad, there's no use, dad.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:49.723
-Listen to me.
-We are not getting through
that barricade.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:51.125
You ready right there, Randy?

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:51.125
I got 'em.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.394
You got eyes on 'em?

01:23:53.396 --> 01:23:54.628
Kill the vehicle.

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:54.628
-Dad, it's--
-do what I say.

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:54.628
There is no way we're making
through that--

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:59.466
just hold your fucking mud
and listen to me.

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.635
Do what I say.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:02.770
You're a fucking tison.

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:06.774
Punch in. Punch in.

01:24:06.776 --> 01:24:08.609
Punch in, goddammit, go!

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:17.785
- Damn! Anybody hit?
- -I'm all right.

01:24:17.787 --> 01:24:19.620
-Go, go, go.
-Move, move, move.

01:24:19.622 --> 01:24:21.255
-Come on.
-There's shots fired.

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:22.689
-Let's go.
-I repeat. Shots fired.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:25.059
Brown Van with unknown
number of passengers

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:26.427
coming your way
in five minutes.

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:27.494
Do you copy?

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.663
Fuck!

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:31.732
Get back here.
Get back here, Randy.

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:41.542
Go faster!

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:43.444
I am going as fast
as I can.

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.213
Gun it, goddammit!

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:49.149
Dad!

01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:51.418
There is another
road block, dad.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.619
Go! Go!

01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:53.687
He ain't stopping.

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.290
Open up!

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:08.802
We're gonna make it, Ricky.
I won't let anything happen
to you--

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.120
Donnie.

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:37.297
I am sorry, Rick.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.566
I didn't keep you safe.

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.637
You did, Donnie.

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:45.539
You did.

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:47.908
Come on.

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.379
Dad!

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.248
Leave it, boy.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.316
Every man for himself.

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:58.485
-Gary!
-Dad?

01:25:58.487 --> 01:25:59.820
Come on, we got to run.

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:01.155
What about Donnie?

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:02.322
- I am going with daddy.
-Shit.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:03.857
What about Donnie?

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:06.160
I am going with daddy.

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.262
Oh, fuck.

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.696
Goddammit.

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:09.696
-Hold.
-Freeze.

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:12.366
-Get him. Get him.
-I got it.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:13.934
Stop.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.372
--Stop!

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:20.641
Get down!

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:22.776
Stay down!

01:26:22.778 --> 01:26:24.678
-How many you got?
-I got two.

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.214
Don't make yourself
the target.

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:28.916
You two, out
of the fucking Van, now!

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:14.761
Fuck you!

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:16.563
Fuck you!

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:08.575
-John, did you--
-yeah, I just...

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:10.410
Just brought him in.

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:11.678
Alive?

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:16.850
Six people.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.853
Little boy,

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:23.523
three women and two men.

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:28.362
Not to mention
the tison boy.

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:29.496
That make seven.

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:32.532
It's on my watch.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.867
John...

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.904
You did everything
you could.

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:39.806
