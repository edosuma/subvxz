WEBVTT

00:19.145 --> 00:20.009
Hey.

00:23.483 --> 00:24.347
Any sign?

00:25.568 --> 00:28.776
I walked everywhere, rechecked
every clearing I could find.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.065
Nothing.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.319
You want me to grab
some shut-eye

00:31.532 --> 00:33.113
while you take another shift?

00:36.287 --> 00:36.992
No.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.364
If Malachi was gonna show up,
we'd have seen something by now,

00:42.251 --> 00:44.333
especially if he was planning
an ambush.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.916
Maybe Malachi had no intention
of ambushing anyone

00:48.132 --> 00:51.090
or giving up that evidence
he had on Nighthorse.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.049
[sighs]

00:52.261 --> 00:55.298
Maybe he was trying to distract
us so he could skip town.

00:55.515 --> 00:59.224
Or someone got wind of what he
was planning and stopped him.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.474
[rattling]

01:07.151 --> 01:08.891
[mumbling indistinctly]

01:10.988 --> 01:12.728
[door creaks]

01:14.408 --> 01:16.490
-That key does not work.
-Why not?

01:16.702 --> 01:18.203
Because I changed the locks.

01:19.497 --> 01:20.361
Oh, yeah?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.572
What's Malachi gonna have
to say about that?

01:22.792 --> 01:26.535
l neither know nor care
because, last night...

01:29.173 --> 01:31.164
...Malachi signed the bar
back over to me.

01:31.676 --> 01:32.461
Why?

01:33.511 --> 01:34.876
That is not your concern.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.462
In fact, nothing
that happens in this bar

01:37.640 --> 01:39.130
is your concern anymore.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.423
You are fired.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.433
[shutter clicks, camera whirs]

01:45.273 --> 01:46.888
I also reserve the right
not to serve you.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.496
[telephone ringing]

02:08.462 --> 02:10.874
It is a beautiful day at the
Red Pony and continual soiree.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.296
This is Henry.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.593
[Vic] It doesn't look like
Malachi's home.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.568
So if Malachi
did leave town,

02:31.777 --> 02:33.392
he didn't take anything
with him.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.194
Not even his car.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.698
Let's run with your theory
that somebody got to him

02:38.909 --> 02:40.285
before he could give you
the evidence.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.325
What exactly
was he gonna give you?

02:43.289 --> 02:45.871
Proof that Nighthorse
struck a deal with the Irish Mob

02:46.042 --> 02:48.784
to run heroin and prostitutes
through the casino,

02:49.420 --> 02:50.956
which makes Nighthorse

02:51.172 --> 02:54.505
the most likely suspect
in Malachi's disappearance.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.708
Why don't you call the casino,
see if Malachi is there?

02:58.262 --> 03:01.254
l'll radio Ferg,
have him put a track

03:01.474 --> 03:03.840
on Malachi's phone
and bank records.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.176
[cellphone rings]

03:08.522 --> 03:09.432
[cellphone beeps]

03:09.649 --> 03:10.434
Who's that?

03:10.650 --> 03:11.560
Nobody.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.313
[Travis]
Hey, Vic.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.521
It's, uh, me, your, uh,
favorite future deputy.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.447
[chuckles]
l-lt's Travis.

03:20.660 --> 03:24.152
Um, so...uh, you're not home,
uh, so you must be busy.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.613
But, uh, I was cleaning out
the Murphy family garage

03:26.832 --> 03:29.915
and found some of my old,
uh, trailer stuff.

03:30.086 --> 03:33.419
So, um, I'm gonna leave it
up underneath your rig,

03:33.631 --> 03:36.873
and you can thank you me later
if so inclined.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.299
[chuckles]

03:38.511 --> 03:40.627
-Yeah. Why would you say that?
-[cellphone beeps]

03:45.142 --> 03:46.723
Hello, Mama.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.015
Okay. Thanks.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.722
The casino said
they're not expecting Malachi

03:52.942 --> 03:55.274
to come in to work
for another couple of hours.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.560
Ferg,
any sign of Malachi?

03:57.780 --> 03:59.645
No activity on his bank
or credit card account

03:59.865 --> 04:02.151
-in the last 24 hours.
-What about his phone?

04:03.411 --> 04:06.869
The last call Malachi made
was at 3:18 yesterday afternoon.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.743
That's right after I talked
to him.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.415
Interesting timing.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.868
Ferg, I need you to see
if Dennis Wabash

04:14.088 --> 04:15.828
has checked out
of the Peaksman Motel.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.792
lf Malachi's missing,

04:18.008 --> 04:19.964
we need to eliminate
any possible suspects.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.257
-On it.
-Hey.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.212
-You gonna go talk
to Nighthorse?
-Not yet.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.844
I need to see what we can
find out before I confront him.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.640
First I'm gonna head over
to the Red Pony,

04:28.853 --> 04:30.184
see if there's been
any sign of Malachi there.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.430
Okay.

04:32.982 --> 04:34.938
-Vic.
-Yeah?

04:35.151 --> 04:37.187
You're picking up
Walter's bad habits.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.476
You don't answer
your phone anymore?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.815
Sorry. Uh, we were
out of cell range.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.363
Well, the assistant
district attorney

04:43.576 --> 04:45.237
has been trying
to get ahold of you.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.535
-ADA Holder? Why?
-She's gonna need you

04:47.747 --> 04:49.487
to testify at
Chance Gilbert's trial

04:49.707 --> 04:51.117
soonerthan
originally planned.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.619
The trial's moving a lot
faster than expected.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.709
Okay. When does she
need me to testify?

04:56.547 --> 04:58.162
-Today.
-Today?

05:00.551 --> 05:01.961
They said I had two weeks.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.635
Yeah. Well, more like
two hours, sweetie.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.177
I'm sorry.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.757
Okay.
Uh, no, it's fine.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.515
Um, I guess I need to
go get myself ready.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.349
-Vic.
-Yeah?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.264
Before you go,
could I see you for a minute?

05:17.902 --> 05:18.641
Sure.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.607
Um...

05:24.325 --> 05:26.816
I've been so distracted lately,
I haven't taken time

05:27.036 --> 05:29.448
to talk with you
about the Chance Gilbert trial.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.871
Well, someone has
been trying to kill you.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.074
Anyway, it's not
exactly something

05:35.294 --> 05:37.250
I've been wanting to
talk about.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.705
Would it help if I came
to the courthouse with you?

05:41.258 --> 05:41.883
Why?

05:42.092 --> 05:43.593
Do you think
you're gonna find Malachi

05:43.761 --> 05:45.843
-hiding in the men's room?
-Vic, I'm serious.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.087
I know what
you went through.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.843
You might think
you're fine,

05:50.059 --> 05:53.597
but when you see his face,
it'll all come flooding back.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.515
I appreciate
the offer. I do.

05:59.735 --> 06:03.523
But you have to go find Malachi,
and I will be fine.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.916
[engine shuts off]

06:19.588 --> 06:21.920
[door opens, closes]

06:23.759 --> 06:25.260
Travis, what are
you doing here?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.006
Just thought I'd sit here
and time how long it takes

06:28.222 --> 06:29.132
for you to tell me.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.507
So far, about 20 seconds.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.304
Tell you what?

06:36.772 --> 06:39.434
Thank you for the
motor-home supplies?

06:39.650 --> 06:40.856
I-I got your voicemail.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.190
Thank you.

06:43.696 --> 06:44.902
Forty seconds.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.605
Travis, I give up.
What do you want?

06:47.825 --> 06:50.487
I want to know
when you were gonna tell me

06:50.703 --> 06:52.034
that we're having a kid.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.445
Get inside.

06:54.665 --> 06:55.700
Okay.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.161
Were you going through
my trash?

07:02.381 --> 07:05.248
No, l was throwing away my trash
and I saw these.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.547
You've been sitting
out there,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.716
-holding on to those
until I got home?
-Yeah.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.430
You do realize I
peed on them, right?

07:10.639 --> 07:11.845
O-Of course I
realize that, okay?

07:12.057 --> 07:15.049
Look, that--
that's not the point, okay?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.351
Okay, Travis,
I got to change for court.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.931
So as much
as I would love to sit here

07:19.148 --> 07:20.684
and have a little
heart-to-heart, I can't.

07:21.859 --> 07:22.689
You know what, Vic?

07:22.902 --> 07:25.063
At some point, we got to deal
with the elephant in the womb.

07:26.572 --> 07:30.531
Okay. One, never
say that again.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.825
And two, isn't it
a bit presumptuous

07:33.037 --> 07:34.948
to think
that you're the father?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.738
Vic, I know my
birds and bees,

07:37.958 --> 07:41.075
and, uh, I don't think
I'm presuming that much.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.128
[both laughing]

07:44.340 --> 07:46.171
Okay. You're not
gonna regret this.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.583
[grunts]

07:49.762 --> 07:50.751
I got it.

07:50.971 --> 07:51.926
Okay.
[grunts]

07:53.265 --> 07:54.015
Shh!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.601
Be quiet.
My mom's a light sleeper.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.799
[laughs]

07:58.479 --> 07:59.434
I'm comin'!

08:00.397 --> 08:02.513
Travis, we made a deal.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.894
That was a one-time thing.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.771
We promised
we'd never talk about it again.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.648
Well, obviously,
the situation has changed.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.230
And, besides,
I mean, we had fun.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.324
Fun has nothing
to do with this.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.448
Really? I must be remembering
a different rodeo, then.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.496
[laughing]
Here we go. [laughs]

08:19.708 --> 08:21.244
Moo. Moo.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.370
[both laugh]

08:22.586 --> 08:23.996
Moo. Moo.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.703
Moo!
[laughs]

08:25.881 --> 08:27.087
-Whoo!
-I did it!

08:27.299 --> 08:28.288
Idid it!
Idid it.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.801
[screams, laughs]

08:33.013 --> 08:33.968
[sighs]

08:35.099 --> 08:36.088
[sighs]

08:39.144 --> 08:40.224
So, what are we gonna do?

08:41.146 --> 08:42.682
Nothing, Travis.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.767
I'm not really ready
to talk about this.

08:48.737 --> 08:52.980
I'm -- I'm just starting
to wrap my own head around it,

08:53.200 --> 08:57.569
and...l don't even know
how I feel, all right?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.912
And I really got to get
to court, so...

09:01.792 --> 09:03.248
[sighs]
Okay.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.661
You look great,
by the way.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.122
You can hardly tell that you're
carrying the extra weight.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.585
I get it.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.343
Don't-- Don't say that again
either, right?

09:23.272 --> 09:24.432
Here you go.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.353
Henry, I'm looking for Malachi.
Is he here?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.980
No.
And he will not be.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.528
He have a day off?
He has more than that.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.072
You know how I told you

09:35.242 --> 09:36.823
Nighthorse was going to help me
get my bar back?

09:37.036 --> 09:38.947
Well, it happened.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.575
How exactly did you
and Nighthorse make it happen?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.532
I found ledgers proving
that Malachi

09:45.753 --> 09:47.994
was using the Red Pony
to launder mob money.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.005
I showed them to Jacob, and he
fired Malachi from the casino.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.671
How did you get Malachi
to give you your bar back?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.301
He signed the
deed over to me

09:56.513 --> 09:58.299
in exchange for not getting
turned in to the authorities.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.678
You do realize that I am
the authorities.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.134
I need to see
those ledgers.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.930
I gave them to Nighthorse.

10:08.150 --> 10:14.271
You had evidence that Jacob
Nighthorse's head of security

10:14.490 --> 10:16.526
was laundering mob money
in my county,

10:16.992 --> 10:20.576
and you gave that evidence
to Nighthorse instead of me?

10:21.789 --> 10:25.532
Yes, I did, after I gave you
the name of Shane Muldoon.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.874
Well, you just helped
a criminal go free.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.748
And you have never
done the same?

10:29.922 --> 10:32.789
Did you hand over
Shane Muldoon's name to the FBI?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.800
I was supposed to meet
with Malachi last night.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.003
He was gonna give me
concrete proof

10:39.223 --> 10:40.588
that Nighthorse
was actually the one

10:40.808 --> 10:42.048
who was running
money laundering

10:42.267 --> 10:43.598
with his old friend
Shane Muldoon.

10:43.811 --> 10:47.178
But Malachi never showed up.
Now I know why.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.065
Any idea
where I might find him?

10:49.483 --> 10:50.108
No.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.727
I went by his house.

10:52.736 --> 10:56.320
He wasn't there, so should I be
looking for a body?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.536
Are you suggesting
that I murdered Malachi

11:01.745 --> 11:03.030
to get my bar back?

11:03.247 --> 11:06.284
I'm suggesting
that your new business partner

11:06.500 --> 11:07.956
has an agenda

11:08.168 --> 11:11.080
that goes way beyond
your ownership of the Red Pony.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.254
Like silencing the one person
that can connect him

11:14.466 --> 11:16.923
to organized crime --
Malachi.

11:18.470 --> 11:22.304
When Nighthorse and I left
Malachi, he was very much alive.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.298
Then you came here.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.432
Where did Nighthorse go?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.013
-I do not know.
-Right.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.812
Ever occur to you
that he might have doubled back

11:31.024 --> 11:32.309
to finish off Malachi,

11:32.526 --> 11:34.016
knowing you would provide
him with an alibi?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.646
Has it occurred to you

11:35.863 --> 11:37.444
that you sound like someone
with a tinfoil hat?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.402
You have become completely
paranoid when it comes to Jacob.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.280
Do you really think that Malachi
is some innocent victim?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.077
We both know what
he's capable of doing.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.155
We put him in jail
in the first place.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.247
You're right, Henry.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.838
You and I used to be
on the same side.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.509
But that was
back before Nighthorse

12:01.013 --> 12:03.299
turned both you and my
daughter against me.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.354
I'm sorry,
but that's not what I do.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.110
If you need legal help,
though, I'll be here.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.399
I don't need legal help.

12:23.619 --> 12:25.905
-I need help help.
-I realize that,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.035
but I-I can't
just shoot people.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.411
-People are saying you can.
-I know.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.083
I'm sorry for
the misunderstanding.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.996
[Jacob] I'd say eventually,
we'll talk--

12:38.217 --> 12:39.127
[sighs] Jacob.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.833
-Cady.
-Hey.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.251
-You should have called.
-Sorry.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.087
Can you give us two minutes?

12:46.058 --> 12:47.673
I'll be fast, Homer, I promise.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.470
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.802
-Hi.
-Did you need something?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.938
Well, I need a new head
of security.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.560
What happened to Malachi?

12:56.777 --> 12:59.063
[sighs]
I had to let him go.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.783
So you want me to just grab
my rifle and, uh, take over?

13:03.992 --> 13:07.735
[chuckles] I have no doubt
that you could, but no.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.950
I'm thinking
I may need to hire somebody

13:11.166 --> 13:12.531
from outside the community.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.791
-Seems reasonable.
-Yeah.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.123
Unfortunately, plenty
of people in the tribe

13:17.339 --> 13:19.375
are not gonna find it
so reasonable.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.041
You, however,
seem to be enjoying

13:23.262 --> 13:25.594
a fair amount of
good will right now

13:26.265 --> 13:28.301
as well as a
growing clientele.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.387
I thought maybe you could hire
more Cheyenne staff

13:31.561 --> 13:33.176
to help you here,

13:33.605 --> 13:36.347
kind of balance out
the loss ofjobs at the casino.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.691
I'll increase your
budget accordingly.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.067
Wow.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.812
Yeah, that --
that would be great.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.488
-I could really use the help.
-ExceHent

13:45.701 --> 13:47.441
What do you the best way is
for me to get out

13:47.661 --> 13:48.946
that I'm looking for
applicants?

13:49.121 --> 13:49.951
Well...

13:51.540 --> 13:53.622
I've, uh,
I've taken care of that.

14:09.850 --> 14:10.930
These people don't...

14:11.977 --> 14:14.309
They don't really have
relevant experience.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.970
Yeah. That's a hard thing
to come by on the res.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.644
So how did you choose
these people?

14:21.320 --> 14:23.436
Well, they're capable,

14:23.780 --> 14:27.147
and they all have close
relatives on the tribal council.

14:28.827 --> 14:29.657
Oh.

14:30.996 --> 14:31.951
Yeah.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.659
So...

14:40.547 --> 14:41.832
It's too bad.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.290
I wish politics didn't have to
muddy the waters here,

14:44.509 --> 14:45.498
but, uh...

14:46.845 --> 14:52.056
sometimes to achieve
something good...

14:53.018 --> 14:55.430
...you have to manipulate
perception a bit.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.104
I'll be in touch.

15:01.735 --> 15:02.485
Okay.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.082
[brakes squeak]

15:21.505 --> 15:22.711
[horn honks]

15:22.881 --> 15:25.543
[turn signal clicking]

15:30.222 --> 15:31.837
I'm so sorry
about the late notice.

15:32.140 --> 15:36.725
This trial has been, uh,
a bit unusual.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.473
How do you feel?
Are you ready?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.394
Yeah, I guess.
Is there anything I should know

15:40.607 --> 15:41.687
about this defense lawyer

15:41.900 --> 15:43.265
before he starts grilling me
on the stand?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.979
Oh, my God.
I thought they told you.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.401
Told me what?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.229
That Chance Gilbert
is representing himself.

15:49.950 --> 15:50.814
He is?

15:52.327 --> 15:53.942
Yeah, he is.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.907
Apparently, he's
done this before.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.196
Did he win?

15:58.041 --> 15:59.281
Yes, he did.

16:00.252 --> 16:00.957
But don't worry.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.080
I promise you I have
a rock-solid case.

16:04.506 --> 16:05.791
State versus Gilbert.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.588
-How are you feeling?
-Sick to my stomach.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.262
[indistinct conversations]

16:19.104 --> 16:20.514
[brakes squeak]

16:22.399 --> 16:23.855
[engine shuts off]

16:24.693 --> 16:26.433
l was beginning to think
you were dead.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.813
[Walt]
Oh, hey, Dave.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.109
Sorry. I, uh,
realize I owe you a call.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.900
-What did you want to discuss?
-Oh, you know, sports.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.577
Politics. Your pending
wrongful-death lawsuit.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.247
Well, it's not really pending.
I told you -- I'm settling.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.291
Yeah, and I've been trying to
reach you to tell you

16:43.503 --> 16:45.414
that Barlow's estate refused
to settle for any amount.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.087
-Tucker Baggett is
taking you to trial.
-What?

16:48.300 --> 16:51.383
So we need to sit down
and discuss strategy.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.970
-You got time now?
-Uh, no.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.505
Actually, one of my, uh,
one of my deputies

16:57.684 --> 17:00.221
is taking the stand
in the Chance Gilbert trial.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.893
I'm here for moral support.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.599
Which deputy?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.226
-Deputy Moretti.
-Uh-huh.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.481
Uh, no.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.567
-You're not going in there.
-I have to.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.646
You have to stay as far away
from that case as possible.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.441
First of all, Chance Gilbert is
one more person

17:15.660 --> 17:18.117
accusing your department
of corruption and harassment.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.328
Barlow's entire case
is predicated

17:20.540 --> 17:22.917
on you repeatedly stepping
outside the acceptable norms

17:23.084 --> 17:24.415
and bounds of a
law enforcement officer.

17:24.628 --> 17:27.210
So until the trial is over,

17:28.215 --> 17:30.251
no public displays
of moral support

17:30.467 --> 17:33.504
for the deputy you were seen
kissing in the hospital...

17:33.720 --> 17:34.960
passionately.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.920
I'd just be sitting
in the back of the gallery.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.801
Right, with the reporters.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.052
No, no.
Terrific.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.644
Make sure they spell
your name right.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.094
[chuckles]
Look, Walt,

17:44.314 --> 17:48.557
the best thing you can do
to help your deputy and yourself

17:48.777 --> 17:51.985
is to get back in your
Bronco and drive away.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.213
[static]

18:16.429 --> 18:17.714
[Ferg]
Sheriff, are you there?

18:22.352 --> 18:23.011
Yep.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.265
Dennis Wabash checked out of
the Peaksman Motel two days ago,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.225
well before the last time
you saw Malachi,

18:28.400 --> 18:30.686
so Dennis isn't feeling
like a suspect.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.309
Since Vic had to take off,

18:32.529 --> 18:33.985
I followed up
with the casino again.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.863
Malachi still hasn't shown
up for his shift.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.358
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.991
The phone company was able
to ping Malachi's cellphone.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.415
They gave me a location,

18:44.624 --> 18:46.580
and for the last hour
and a half, it hasn't moved.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.502
[cheers and applause]

18:52.132 --> 18:53.042
[Woman] Go!

19:03.935 --> 19:05.175
Slow day at the office?

19:06.396 --> 19:09.103
Just helping to raise
a little money for a new school.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.773
Our jobs aren't supposed to be
all doom and gloom, you know?

19:13.403 --> 19:15.359
I find it easier
to do the hard stuff

19:15.572 --> 19:17.688
when I can remember
why I'm doing it.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.280
You should try it.

19:19.909 --> 19:20.989
Well, I'd like to.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.494
The doom and gloom keeps
demanding all my attention.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.450
What do you want?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.167
I need to report
a missing person.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.240
Who?

19:29.461 --> 19:30.871
Your former boss.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.411
Malachi is missing?

19:32.631 --> 19:33.837
That's the first
I've heard of it.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.040
I was supposed to meet
Malachi last night.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.921
He said he was gonna give me
some incriminating evidence

19:39.137 --> 19:42.300
that Nighthorse is tied to
the mob, but he never showed up.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.800
Evidence against Nighthorse.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.599
Now I know why you're so
anxious to find Malachi.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.347
Did you try the casino?

19:48.521 --> 19:51.433
Well, he didn't show up for work
there or the Red Pony.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.311
He's not home, either,
but his car is,

19:53.485 --> 19:55.726
so I don't think
he's taken off.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.028
So here you are.
Demanding what, exactly?

19:59.658 --> 20:00.943
[paper rustling]

20:01.159 --> 20:05.653
We traced the Malachi's
cellphone to here.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.862
You recognize the location?

20:12.879 --> 20:16.997
[Holder] Kidnapping, assault,
battery, torture.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.674
It's a harrowing ordeal that
Deputy Moretti went through.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.381
How has your recovery been?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.721
Physically, I'm lucky.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.016
I'm not suffering from
any lingering effects

20:28.228 --> 20:29.559
of my grade-2 concussion.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.311
What about emotionally
and psychologically?

20:32.482 --> 20:35.064
Emotionally has been
a bit more difficult.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.607
I'm sure it has been.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.770
I understand.
Well, we wish you the best.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.115
Thank you.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.445
No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.493
Your witness, Mr. Gilbert.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.946
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.666
[thud echoing]

20:56.840 --> 21:03.632
Ms. Moretti... first of
all, how have you been?

21:09.436 --> 21:15.477
Ms. Moretti, are you familiar
with the Wyoming statute

21:15.692 --> 21:18.149
number 6-2-201?

21:18.319 --> 21:21.026
-Yeah, I am.
-Can you educate us?

21:21.239 --> 21:23.730
It's the law that says
you can't kidnap someone.

21:23.950 --> 21:24.814
That's right.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.194
It's punishable
with a sentence

21:26.411 --> 21:28.117
-of 20 years to life.
-Objection, Your Honor.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.946
This is not the
sentencing phase, is it?

21:31.124 --> 21:31.954
Sustained.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.491
Now, Ms. Moretti,

21:34.711 --> 21:37.544
do you know what the
Fourth Amendment says?

21:37.756 --> 21:38.495
I do.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.957
It says that
"the right of the people

21:42.177 --> 21:47.092
to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects,

21:47.307 --> 21:51.346
against unreasonable
searches and seizures,

21:51.519 --> 21:54.636
shall not be violated."

21:54.856 --> 21:56.187
That is correct.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.266
Which law supersedes
the other?

21:59.444 --> 22:02.186
I know that you held me
against my will.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.648
The federal law.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.528
You see, your state
kidnapping statutes

22:07.744 --> 22:10.076
do not give you the right

22:10.288 --> 22:14.327
to violate my rights
under the U.S. Constitution.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.500
-I didn't violate your rights.
-Did you come to my door

22:17.712 --> 22:19.953
and fail to announce
yourself as a deputy?

22:20.173 --> 22:21.083
l was off duty.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.414
Can I get a "yes" or "no"?

22:22.842 --> 22:23.627
No.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.543
I did not identify myself
as a deputy.

22:26.721 --> 22:27.676
Oh.

22:29.224 --> 22:32.716
Did you enter and search
my house, even my root cellar?

22:32.936 --> 22:34.927
Did I search
your root cellar?

22:35.146 --> 22:36.477
[gasps]

22:36.689 --> 22:38.520
You threw me down there
and locked me up.

22:38.733 --> 22:43.727
In defense of my civil liberties
and those of my family.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.532
Ms. Moretti...

22:49.118 --> 22:51.074
Victoria, Victoria.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.661
Such a pretty name.

22:54.958 --> 23:00.203
Isn't it true that you came to
my house under false pretenses,

23:00.421 --> 23:05.085
because your department had
previously failed to convict me

23:05.301 --> 23:06.711
on some trumped-up charges?

23:06.928 --> 23:09.761
And you --
Oh, yes, you were willing

23:09.973 --> 23:13.386
to manufacture a just cause
to search my house.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.012
Yeah.

23:16.271 --> 23:17.351
No.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.387
-No?
-No, it's not true.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.770
When I went to your door,
I had no idea who you were

23:23.611 --> 23:26.023
or your crazy wife
or sister-in-law --

23:26.239 --> 23:27.399
whatever hell she is.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.697
I didn't know about your
made-up sovereign nation

23:29.909 --> 23:32.116
of Gilbertsville or the fact
that your justice system

23:32.328 --> 23:35.912
is based on beating people
with baseball bats.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.119
And I also didn't know...
[spectators murmuring]

23:39.335 --> 23:41.712
...that you kept a dead body
in the damn freezer.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.461
[indistinct shouting]

23:43.673 --> 23:44.958
[Judge]
Order!

23:46.301 --> 23:48.667
I told you to shut
your mouth!

23:48.845 --> 23:49.675
[shouting continues]

23:49.888 --> 23:52.595
[Judge]
Order! Order!

23:52.765 --> 23:53.800
Order! Order!

23:54.017 --> 23:55.132
Bailiff!

23:55.351 --> 23:57.467
Order in the court!
[gavel banging]

24:06.237 --> 24:07.852
[Walt] When was the last time
you were out here?

24:08.072 --> 24:09.983
[Mathias]
This is sacred ground.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.939
I haven't stepped
foot out here

24:12.160 --> 24:14.116
since David Ridges shot
your deputy.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.451
My deputy was here
investigating

24:16.664 --> 24:19.201
where Nighthorse helped
David Ridges fake his death.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.250
Don't you think
it's a little coincidental

24:22.462 --> 24:24.623
that the phone company pinged
Malachi's phone

24:24.839 --> 24:25.669
to the same spot?

24:26.758 --> 24:31.127
Makes me wonder if Nighthorse
made another sacrifice.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.092
Come on.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.638
I don't see any phone, no body,
no scavenger birds --

24:35.850 --> 24:37.386
nothing but land and sky.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.145
Can I borrow your phone?

24:43.691 --> 24:44.476
Who are you calling?

24:45.485 --> 24:46.691
Not sure.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.393
Maybe the spirits.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.950
[cellphone ringing]

25:06.589 --> 25:08.796
[ringing continues]

25:17.809 --> 25:18.514
[cellphone beeps]

25:29.779 --> 25:32.395
So I guess cockroaches bleed
after all.

25:50.425 --> 25:51.289
[shutter clicking]

26:03.479 --> 26:05.561
You really think
Jacob Nighthorse did something

26:05.773 --> 26:06.979
to his own head
of security?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.685
Yeah.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.147
I'm starting to believe
he had some help.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.369
Any further outbursts,
and I will clear this courtroom.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.203
Are we clear?

26:28.504 --> 26:32.964
Now...Mr. Gilbert, proceed.

26:34.510 --> 26:38.048
Ms. Moretti, why did
your ex-husband leave you?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.755
Why my ex-husband left
is none of your business.

26:40.975 --> 26:41.839
Wrong.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.550
It is my business.

26:44.562 --> 26:47.804
You see,
freedom is my business.

26:48.983 --> 26:53.602
And your relationship
to your ex-husband is relevant,

26:53.821 --> 26:56.403
which this court
will understand

26:56.616 --> 26:59.232
once you've answered
my question.

27:00.453 --> 27:03.695
Now, why did you and Sean
get divorced?

27:04.165 --> 27:06.156
Well, getting kidnapped
and tortured

27:06.375 --> 27:10.368
by you and your shitheel goons
didn't help our relationship.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.250
That's not what he said.
Do you know what he said?

27:13.466 --> 27:15.422
He said the two of
you broke up

27:15.635 --> 27:17.796
because of your
romantic obsession

27:18.012 --> 27:23.132
with the man who's supposed to
be your boss, Walt Longmire.

27:23.351 --> 27:23.965
Yes.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.725
And your ex spoke about this

27:26.938 --> 27:32.683
in his videotaped testimony
that we all reviewed last week.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.438
He wouldn't have said that.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.565
He didn't deny it.

27:37.865 --> 27:38.900
Do you?

27:39.117 --> 27:40.482
I have never had

27:40.701 --> 27:45.195
an inappropriate
romantic relationship

27:45.414 --> 27:46.699
with Sheriff Longmire.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.623
A strong, emphatic
denial, then.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.371
Yeah.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.078
And you wouldn't
change that just a bit

27:54.298 --> 27:57.415
if I told you that I'm privy
to transcripts of a deposition

27:57.635 --> 28:01.878
you gave to a Tucker Baggett
just recently?

28:04.016 --> 28:05.176
Ooh.

28:05.393 --> 28:08.100
Got very quiet in here
all of a sudden.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.563
[laughter]

28:10.273 --> 28:13.140
So let me try this
a different way, then.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.606
Ms. Moretti,

28:15.153 --> 28:18.896
have you ever taken Walt
Longmire's face in your hands

28:19.115 --> 28:22.403
and kissed him on his lips
with passion?

28:22.618 --> 28:25.325
-Objection!
-Yes, you should object!

28:25.538 --> 28:30.077
We should all object to a
sheriff's department that is run

28:30.293 --> 28:35.083
like it's Walt Longmire's
own personal justice system

28:35.339 --> 28:37.955
as well as his own harem.

28:38.176 --> 28:39.382
Objection, Your Honor.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.255
He's making
defamatory statements

28:41.470 --> 28:43.552
about witnesses
who aren't even present.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.963
Sustained.

28:45.183 --> 28:49.176
Mr. Gilbert, I am no
longer entertained.

28:49.395 --> 28:54.185
Next non-question brings this
cross-examination to a close.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.560
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.268
All right, Deputy Moretti,

28:58.487 --> 29:02.071
Sheriff Longmire
was willing to put himself

29:02.241 --> 29:05.153
in a bullet's path
to protect you.

29:05.369 --> 29:10.204
Now, if he asked you, would you
risk your life for him?

29:10.958 --> 29:11.743
Yeah.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.170
Because that's part
of the job.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.792
Would you also,
out of your feverish devotion

29:19.008 --> 29:20.873
for the great Walt Longmire,

29:21.093 --> 29:24.506
have entered my home
under false pretenses

29:24.680 --> 29:28.343
just so he could
illegally search my property

29:28.559 --> 29:31.471
and fabricate charges
against me?

29:33.522 --> 29:34.602
No.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.225
Not even if he offered
to kiss you?

29:36.400 --> 29:37.230
Objection!

29:37.401 --> 29:38.390
Sustained.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.852
Mr. Gilbert,
I have given you

29:41.072 --> 29:42.733
more than enough leeway.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.440
-We are done here.
-Walt Longmire killed my brother!

29:46.160 --> 29:48.902
And he's manipulated
this naive individual...

29:49.080 --> 29:51.116
Mr. Gilbert, that is enough!

29:51.332 --> 29:53.664
...in his pursuit
of a vendetta against me.

29:53.876 --> 29:56.663
-Ms. Moretti, you are excused.
-A vendetta against me.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.874
[echoing]
Run back to your master!

30:03.094 --> 30:06.552
Find out what law
he wants you to break next.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.683
[indistinct conversations]

30:22.405 --> 30:23.895
What did you do?

30:24.865 --> 30:25.820
Excuse me?

30:26.575 --> 30:28.952
Or should I say
what did Hector do?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.075
Hmm?

30:31.205 --> 30:34.948
Perhaps we should continue
this discussion in my office.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.620
What are you talking about?

30:41.549 --> 30:43.255
Malachi's gone missing,

30:43.467 --> 30:45.207
and I just got back from the res
with the sheriff.

30:45.428 --> 30:47.635
Would you like to know
what we found out there?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.550
Malachi's phone
and his blood

30:51.142 --> 30:54.350
and the words "Hector Lives"
spelled out with stones.

30:57.315 --> 30:58.430
I guess you just can't help

30:58.649 --> 31:00.514
signing your name to
your work, can you?

31:00.735 --> 31:03.772
Hector did not sign anything.
Hector did not do anything.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.694
So you were never
out at that cliff?

31:08.909 --> 31:09.898
l was.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.985
With Nighthorse.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.324
We took Malachi out there

31:14.540 --> 31:16.280
to banish him for
betraying his tribe,

31:16.500 --> 31:19.867
for bringing the mob and heroin
and despair to our people,

31:20.087 --> 31:21.793
for killing Mingan!

31:23.841 --> 31:24.956
Nighthorse cut him,

31:25.176 --> 31:28.168
and I got him to sign
the Red Pony back over to me.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.719
But when we left him,
Malachi was alive.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.467
So who wrote out
"Hector Lives"?

31:32.641 --> 31:33.801
I do not know.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.758
Who knew you were
taking Malachi out there?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.385
Just Jacob.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.435
What is it?

31:44.236 --> 31:47.069
Walt said he suspected that
Nighthorse put on a show for me,

31:47.239 --> 31:48.854
then went back
to kill Malachi.

31:49.450 --> 31:50.485
[sighs]

31:52.745 --> 31:55.031
[groans]

31:55.206 --> 31:56.286
Maybe he did.

31:56.499 --> 31:58.160
Maybe he wrote out
"Hector Lives."

31:59.251 --> 32:01.458
Hector would be a handy
fall guy for this.

32:04.465 --> 32:07.582
Whatever happened, we need to
find Malachi, dead or alive,

32:07.760 --> 32:10.672
before Walt tries to convict
Hector of murder again.

32:13.057 --> 32:13.671
ﬁhud]

32:26.529 --> 32:27.518
Are you following me?

32:28.531 --> 32:30.487
Don't be paranoid, Deputy.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.826
Don't threaten me,
you whacked-out bitch.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.151
You seem nervous, Victoria.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.657
Don't know what to do without
your uniform and your gun?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.283
I know exactly what to do.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.785
You want to see
for yourself,

32:40.960 --> 32:43.201
or do you want to do
the smart thing and walk away?

32:44.797 --> 32:45.786
He's going to win.

32:46.507 --> 32:49.920
And when he gets out,
he's gonna remember your lies.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.433
[machines beeping, chiming]

33:11.657 --> 33:13.989
[indistinct conversations]

33:15.494 --> 33:16.950
-Jacob.
-Hey.

33:17.121 --> 33:20.033
How is Eamonn recovering
from his injury?

33:20.249 --> 33:21.830
He should be fine,

33:22.001 --> 33:24.583
especially if I can find the
person who shot him

33:24.795 --> 33:26.080
and shot at us.

33:26.881 --> 33:27.836
You mind if I sit?

33:28.048 --> 33:28.878
Of course.

33:31.927 --> 33:36.387
So, uh, Malachi come
in to work today?

33:36.599 --> 33:39.261
You think Malachi was the one
in the woods shooting at us?

33:39.727 --> 33:41.558
-I do.
-Well, so do I.

33:42.396 --> 33:44.102
Which is why he won't
be coming to work today.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.475
lfired him.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.306
How'd you figure out
it was Malachi?

33:47.526 --> 33:50.063
I found some discrepancies
in his books

33:50.279 --> 33:53.942
that suggested he'd made
his own side deal with the mob.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.859
I imagine my
ending that arrangement

33:58.078 --> 34:01.206
hurt both his finances
and his reputation.

34:01.415 --> 34:04.407
And Malachi doesn't handle
those kind of setbacks

34:04.627 --> 34:06.333
as calmly as I do.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.957
-Do you know where he is?
-I do not.

34:09.173 --> 34:12.040
Why don't you give me
that bookkeeping evidence?

34:12.259 --> 34:16.343
I'll track down Malachi and
make sure he's put behind bars.

34:16.931 --> 34:18.091
Mm, yeah.

34:19.642 --> 34:21.849
Well, I can't do that.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.267
Why not?

34:23.479 --> 34:24.810
Because of our history.

34:26.148 --> 34:29.140
You and I both know what you'll
do with those books, Walt.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.316
You'll use them
against me.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.072
No matter what your
intentions are now,

34:34.240 --> 34:36.276
eventually,
you'll convince yourself

34:36.492 --> 34:39.450
that I condoned all
of Malachi's illegal activities.

34:39.662 --> 34:43.496
You really can't help
yourself at this point.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.289
You're determined to see me
as a criminal.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.833
I wonder why.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.288
Boom.
[chuckles]

34:49.505 --> 34:53.123
I can't win with you, man.
Cannot win.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.049
So I think I'll take my chances
with Malachi instead.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.093
-The man who shot at you.
-Yeah.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.557
I don't think he'll be trying
anything more.

35:00.766 --> 35:01.926
Is that because
you murdered him?

35:02.560 --> 35:03.549
Wow.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.689
[sighs]

35:07.898 --> 35:11.607
I mean, that -- that was
even faster than I expected.

35:11.819 --> 35:14.811
So I'm a murderer now?

35:15.030 --> 35:16.281
Yeah.

35:17.658 --> 35:23.745
You do realize I'm being asked
to testify at your civil trial.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.039
[machines beeping, chiming]

35:28.836 --> 35:29.871
Is that a threat?

35:30.087 --> 35:32.373
It's advice.
It's damn good advice.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.000
Unbe-freaking-Iievable.

35:34.216 --> 35:36.207
You -- You can't even prove
the man is dead.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.376
Have you found his body?

35:38.596 --> 35:40.052
Not yet, but I will.

35:40.264 --> 35:42.220
So you didn't come here
because you thought Malachi

35:42.433 --> 35:44.048
was behind the
shooting, did you?

35:44.977 --> 35:47.138
No, no.
Of course not.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.685
You think I was behind it.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.728
You think I made the deal
with the mob,

35:50.941 --> 35:53.478
shot at myself
to throw you off the track,

35:54.528 --> 35:56.234
and now you think
I killed Malachi

35:56.447 --> 36:01.066
because that ungrateful bastard
was gonna give me up, yeah?

36:02.244 --> 36:02.903
No.

36:05.539 --> 36:08.576
I don't think you actually did
any of those things.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.498
I think, as usual,

36:10.711 --> 36:12.827
you found someone else
to do the dirty work for you.

36:13.047 --> 36:15.959
I think you had Malachi
make those deals with the mob.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.882
I think you hired someone
to shoot at you in my presence

36:19.094 --> 36:20.345
and miss.

36:20.554 --> 36:23.591
And I think you had
somebody else kill Malachi

36:24.558 --> 36:26.640
so you could keep his blood
off your hands.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.717
You know, I haven't seen you
this sure of yourself

36:28.937 --> 36:31.519
since you were convinced
that I had both Branch

36:31.732 --> 36:33.188
and your wife killed.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.436
It's almost entertaining.

36:35.653 --> 36:37.314
It's like I can't sleep
at night anymore,

36:37.529 --> 36:41.317
wondering, what wild fiction
is Walt gonna come up with next?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.903
I think this is stranger
than fiction.

36:44.953 --> 36:49.947
I found Malachi's cellphone and
blood out on the reservation,

36:50.125 --> 36:54.118
right near where you staged
David Ridges' funeral pyre.

36:54.338 --> 36:57.796
I also found the words
"Hector Lives" nearby.

36:58.008 --> 37:00.124
[sighs]
So there it is.

37:00.344 --> 37:01.959
-Now you think I'm Hector.
-No.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.094
I think you've recruited him

37:04.306 --> 37:07.013
to do the things Ridges
used to do for you.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.968
I don't suppose you would
tell me who Hector is.

37:11.188 --> 37:13.600
Ifl knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

37:14.817 --> 37:17.274
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.062
So I think I'll just answer
any further questions

37:21.240 --> 37:26.280
with a genuinely
stunned silence.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.867
[chuckles]

37:31.041 --> 37:34.329
You know...Jacob...

37:35.754 --> 37:38.837
...l'm getting closer to finding
this new Hector.

37:39.049 --> 37:43.759
And when I do,
I'm gonna bring him down,

37:43.971 --> 37:46.383
along with anyone
who's using him

37:46.598 --> 37:49.055
as their own
mercenary for hire.

37:50.561 --> 37:51.892
You have a nice day.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.458
[gasps]

38:20.674 --> 38:21.538
Shit!

38:21.759 --> 38:23.750
-Travis!
-Aah! Oh!

38:23.969 --> 38:26.506
Aah! Why would
you hit me?

38:26.680 --> 38:27.965
[groans]
All right. Here.

38:28.182 --> 38:29.092
Right here.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.923
-Lay back.
-Yeah, yeah.

38:31.602 --> 38:32.887
Oh, man.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.513
That's one hell
of a right hook.

38:34.730 --> 38:35.936
Yeah. Well, I'm also
a good shot.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.763
So you're lucky
you just got the fist.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.224
You shouldn't be punching
your baby's father, anyway.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.267
Travis.
[sighs]

38:42.446 --> 38:44.732
Look, there is
a good possibility

38:44.948 --> 38:46.939
that you are not
the father, all right?

38:48.619 --> 38:51.235
So...there's somebody else?

38:52.998 --> 38:53.908
Yeah.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.949
[sniffles]
Who?

38:57.169 --> 38:59.455
Okay, I am not discussing
my sex life with you,

38:59.671 --> 39:00.956
so if that's
why you came back --

39:01.173 --> 39:02.834
No, that's --
that's not why I came over.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.837
I-I came over 'cause
I wanted you to have this.

39:06.053 --> 39:06.917
Here.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.090
It's a coupon
for, uh, free babysitting.

39:13.310 --> 39:16.052
Look, I-I know you don't want to
think about this right now,

39:16.271 --> 39:18.011
so you can stick it in a drawer
or whatever,

39:18.232 --> 39:20.473
but I want you
to have that.

39:21.777 --> 39:22.983
You can cash it in
whenever you want to.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.402
No limits,
no expiration date.

39:25.614 --> 39:27.275
Whoever the father
happens to be.

39:28.575 --> 39:33.114
Look, Vic, I grew up
raised by a single mom, okay?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.328
And however
this plays out...

39:37.501 --> 39:39.366
...at some point,
you're gonna need a friend.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.042
Thank you, Travis.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.550
Okay.

39:49.596 --> 39:53.589
So, uh, what...
are the odds?

39:54.101 --> 39:55.090
That you're the father?

39:55.310 --> 39:57.266
Or not the father.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.055
-Fifty-fifty.
-Oh.

40:02.276 --> 40:03.982
So it's just one
other dude? Okay.

40:04.194 --> 40:06.230
That's -- That's good.
Um, That's not bad.

40:06.446 --> 40:10.610
I mean, so, um, is...
is he your type?

40:11.994 --> 40:13.109
I don't have a type.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.114
[chuckles]
Yeah, you do.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.831
Manly, alpha male,

40:17.040 --> 40:19.497
natural-born
law-enforcement type.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.497
[cellphone rings]

40:23.755 --> 40:24.540
[cellphone beeps]

40:24.756 --> 40:25.916
Hey, Walt.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.085
-|s it him?
-[whispering] Shush!

40:28.760 --> 40:30.011
What?
No, nothing.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.260
I'm fine.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.212
Yeah.

40:36.310 --> 40:37.516
The trial went fine.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.009
Mm-hmm.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.220
Thanks for checking.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.647
Okay. Bye.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.810
So, uh...is it him?

40:49.823 --> 40:51.905
-You need to leave.
-Okay.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.321
[sighs]

41:05.297 --> 41:07.754
Why do you think this guy
will lead us to Malachi?

41:09.468 --> 41:12.460
Because he is Malachi's
most loyal lieutenant.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.889
If Malachi is alive,

41:15.098 --> 41:17.180
Darius would be the first person
he would call.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.472
Maybe.

41:18.644 --> 41:20.009
In my experience,

41:20.228 --> 41:22.139
loyalty among criminals
can shift in a hurry

41:22.356 --> 41:24.017
if someone shows up
with more money.

41:24.608 --> 41:27.395
You think Nighthorse paid him
to turn on Malachi?

41:27.611 --> 41:30.728
I think I just saw a big thug
put a shovel in his car.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.855
Let's see where he's going.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.488
[engine starts, car beeping]

41:58.600 --> 41:59.385
Hey,Dad.

41:59.559 --> 42:00.218
Hey.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.851
-Floor looks good.
-Yeah.

42:08.068 --> 42:10.229
Except for the blood stain
under that rug.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.064
Yeah.

42:13.073 --> 42:14.108
What are you doing here?

42:14.282 --> 42:18.616
I wanted to talk to you
about Nighthorse.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.955
Has he been by lately?

42:21.373 --> 42:23.534
Yeah.
He is my boss.

42:23.750 --> 42:26.036
Yeah. I haven't
forgotten that.

42:27.921 --> 42:30.708
Has he asked you to provide
any legal assistance

42:30.882 --> 42:32.213
to, uh, someone
that's been operating

42:32.426 --> 42:34.667
outside of reservation law?

42:36.388 --> 42:37.138
What?

42:38.181 --> 42:39.170
Like who?

42:41.476 --> 42:42.340
Hector.

42:45.939 --> 42:47.804
You know what Jacob
did ask me?

42:48.025 --> 42:49.640
He came by with Henry

42:49.860 --> 42:51.816
to ask me how I was doing
after shooting a man.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.902
He also offered to pay
for extra employees

42:55.115 --> 42:57.071
to help me manage
the workload here.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.608
What a monster.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.615
What about Henry?

43:02.831 --> 43:05.573
He and Nighthorse
seem to be closer than ever.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.711
Has Henry asked you
to do anything for Nighthorse?

43:10.047 --> 43:12.129
Has he asked you
to help out Hector?

43:13.091 --> 43:14.251
You know what?

43:14.468 --> 43:15.924
Since I started
this legal-aid center,

43:16.136 --> 43:18.548
Henry has asked for my help
exactly one time.

43:19.556 --> 43:21.717
He wanted to foster
a Cheyenne child named Mingan

43:21.933 --> 43:23.969
whose only parent
O.D.'d on heroin.

43:26.438 --> 43:28.724
-Henry's fostering a child?
-No.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.976
Because the boy ended up
killing himself.

43:32.444 --> 43:33.729
When was this?

43:36.281 --> 43:37.441
[clears throat]

43:40.494 --> 43:42.075
The 13th.

43:42.287 --> 43:43.197
The 13th.

43:43.413 --> 43:45.904
Dad, Jacob and Henry
are good men.

43:46.083 --> 43:47.994
They're not perfect,
but they care.

43:48.877 --> 43:51.084
It's a daily battle
trying to fight the hopelessness

43:51.296 --> 43:54.709
and powerlessness
that's taken over this place.

43:54.883 --> 43:58.341
You have to think differently
here to make things work.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.965
If you were here every day,
maybe you'd see that.

44:01.181 --> 44:02.387
I see plenty.

44:04.392 --> 44:07.304
I see Nighthorse
pretending to be a good man

44:07.521 --> 44:11.935
and you and Henry both falling
for it regardless of what I say.

44:12.943 --> 44:14.934
Are you still dating
that psychiatrist?

44:16.113 --> 44:17.478
Because if you are,
maybe you could talk to her

44:17.697 --> 44:20.689
about your irrational
Nighthorse obsession.

44:24.371 --> 44:28.330
I love you, Dad,
and I always will.

44:28.917 --> 44:29.781
But I...

44:31.545 --> 44:34.161
I think maybe you've been doing
this job for too long.

44:34.923 --> 44:36.504
You've developed these --

44:43.223 --> 44:46.215
and you're not thinking
clearly anymore.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.885
It might be time
to consider retiring.

45:04.744 --> 45:06.405
Thank you for your counsel.

45:12.335 --> 45:14.747
Hey, Dad, I'm totally over
shooting and killing that man,

45:14.921 --> 45:16.752
so thanks for asking.

45:44.159 --> 45:46.195
[Mathias] Put your hands up
where I can see them.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.782
What's the charge --
digging without a license?

45:53.001 --> 45:54.116
What's in the bag?

45:54.920 --> 45:56.000
I don't know.

45:56.213 --> 45:57.123
Henry!

46:01.885 --> 46:03.091
Check that bag.

46:06.014 --> 46:08.505
Who sent you out here, Darius?
Malachi?

46:10.852 --> 46:12.092
You know where Malachi is?

46:14.189 --> 46:15.679
Nighthorse send you
out here?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.435
[sighs]

46:18.652 --> 46:19.812
Mathias?

46:20.028 --> 46:21.268
What's in there?

46:23.615 --> 46:25.151
Enough money to kill for.

46:29.788 --> 46:32.655
Oh, so that's the door you use
when you want to avoid people.

46:32.874 --> 46:34.284
Oh, smart.

46:35.085 --> 46:35.915
Morning, Dave.

46:36.086 --> 46:37.826
I'm glad I insisted
that I wait for you in here,

46:38.838 --> 46:42.422
although I think even you
would have had a hard time

46:42.634 --> 46:43.919
avoiding this.

46:44.761 --> 46:47.047
"Survivalist Leader Claims
Lovelorn Deputy

46:47.264 --> 46:48.595
Does Sheriff's Bidding."

46:48.807 --> 46:50.547
The more this
Chance Gilbert character

46:50.767 --> 46:52.883
puts on his sex-drenched
conspiracy circus,

46:53.103 --> 46:55.139
the more interested
the media gets.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.687
Well, he's a deranged
psychopath.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.686
He'll say anything
to try and get off.

47:00.902 --> 47:02.312
Unfortunately,
everything he's saying

47:02.529 --> 47:03.894
feeds into the
exact same narrative

47:04.114 --> 47:06.321
Tucker Baggett is building
in your civil case,

47:06.533 --> 47:09.900
that you're a rogue sheriff
who plays by his own rules

47:10.120 --> 47:12.361
and runs his
department like a cult.

47:13.081 --> 47:14.662
Tucker Baggett said that?

47:15.041 --> 47:16.542
No. Chance Gilbert
said that.

47:16.751 --> 47:19.493
He compared you to Jim Jones
and David Koresh.

47:21.881 --> 47:24.372
I appreciate coolness
under pressure, Walt,

47:24.592 --> 47:26.878
but I suggest you start
taking this seriously

47:27.095 --> 47:29.131
and help me build a
decent defense on your behalf.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.554
Fine.
lwill.

47:31.766 --> 47:32.801
Let's get started.

47:33.018 --> 47:35.976
Actually, uh, Dave,
I can't start now.

47:36.187 --> 47:38.348
I've got a...
missing-persons case.

47:39.399 --> 47:41.310
-How about tomorrow?
-Perfect.

47:41.526 --> 47:45.235
Just like the old saying --
no better time than tomorrow.

47:47.407 --> 47:49.773
And just
a parting thought --

47:50.702 --> 47:52.283
if you don't stop doing
your job for a moment

47:52.495 --> 47:53.871
to deal with this lawsuit,

47:54.581 --> 47:57.072
you may find yourself
without a job to do.

47:59.169 --> 48:00.409
[door closes]

48:00.628 --> 48:02.755
[newspaper rustling]

48:04.883 --> 48:06.123
[sighs]

48:14.267 --> 48:16.098
Vic, Ferg?

48:22.442 --> 48:23.397
What is it?

48:23.735 --> 48:25.225
It's about Malachi.

48:25.403 --> 48:28.190
I need you to pull files on
the recent drug-dealer attacks

48:28.365 --> 48:29.650
linked to Hector on the res.

48:30.325 --> 48:31.030
Okay.

48:31.201 --> 48:33.658
So, uh, that'd
be Jamie DeBell,

48:33.870 --> 48:36.862
when he was making
his res pizza delivery.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.576
And who else?

48:38.792 --> 48:44.207
Joey Takoda, the guy Henry found
outside the Red Pony.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.458
Hector burned his heroin stash.

48:47.217 --> 48:48.582
Okay. Anyone else?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.250
Maybe. Let's just
start with those two.

48:50.470 --> 48:51.220
Okay.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.261
23rd.

48:55.767 --> 48:58.725
When did, uh, Hector attack
Jamie and burn up his pot?

48:58.937 --> 49:02.270
Um...the 18th.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.350
18th.

49:06.236 --> 49:07.225
What are you doing?

49:08.655 --> 49:09.770
I'm thinking.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.567
When did Hector burn
Joey Takoda's heroin stash?

49:15.787 --> 49:16.697
Um...

49:19.040 --> 49:19.870
15th.

49:21.084 --> 49:22.073
The 15th.

49:23.294 --> 49:27.503
So these incidents
are all connected to Hector.

49:28.341 --> 49:29.922
Well, and heroin.

49:30.802 --> 49:33.885
-No. Jamie only
deals pot.
-True.

49:34.097 --> 49:37.339
Eddie Harp was recruiting him
to deal heroin.

49:37.976 --> 49:40.467
And if Malachi is the one
who brought in Eddie

49:40.687 --> 49:43.895
and the Irish Mob, then he's
tied to heroin as well.

49:44.107 --> 49:49.318
So if Hector is waging
a one-man war on drugs, why now?

49:49.529 --> 49:51.440
None of these things
were happening last month,

49:52.073 --> 49:54.530
and then, suddenly...
a whole bunch of attacks

49:54.742 --> 49:56.278
in a short period of time.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.030
Yeah.

49:59.247 --> 50:00.487
Something must have
triggered it.

50:02.375 --> 50:04.411
Something right before the 15th.

50:04.627 --> 50:06.583
We should check and see
what was happening on the res

50:06.796 --> 50:07.911
during that time.

50:08.131 --> 50:09.462
Maybe there was
a drug-related incident

50:09.674 --> 50:11.960
that happened just before
Hector's first attack.

50:12.177 --> 50:14.338
[sighs]
There was.

50:16.222 --> 50:20.807
The suicide of this boy
on the 13th.

50:24.189 --> 50:26.646
Okay, but does that relate
to the drugs

50:26.858 --> 50:27.938
and all the other stuff?

50:28.151 --> 50:30.267
His only parent O.D.'d
from heroin.

50:31.404 --> 50:33.690
And you think Hector's
avenging his death?

50:34.491 --> 50:35.401
I do.

50:36.784 --> 50:39.742
You got any better idea who
Hector is and where to find him?

50:41.039 --> 50:42.154
I might.

50:43.374 --> 50:44.238
Okay.

50:44.459 --> 50:47.667
I'm gonna ask you again --
Whose money is this?

50:47.879 --> 50:48.914
I don't know.

50:49.130 --> 50:50.631
Well, how'd you know
where to find it?

50:52.091 --> 50:53.706
Just lucky, I guess.

50:54.844 --> 50:56.084
This is a waste of time.

51:00.683 --> 51:03.095
Darius, is Malachi alive
or dead?

51:03.311 --> 51:04.300
Yes.

51:04.729 --> 51:06.265
Okay. That's it.

51:06.439 --> 51:07.895
If you're not talking,
I'm locking you up.

51:08.107 --> 51:08.937
All right.

51:09.150 --> 51:10.356
I'll talk.

51:14.364 --> 51:15.604
To a lawye r.

51:27.710 --> 51:28.540
[door opens]

51:32.465 --> 51:33.215
[door closes]

51:50.858 --> 51:53.895
I gather court didn't go as well
as you said it did.

51:55.363 --> 51:56.443
No.

51:58.032 --> 51:59.021
Why didn't you tell me?

51:59.951 --> 52:01.612
Because I didn't want to
worry you.

52:03.079 --> 52:05.286
But now it's --
it's all over the papers,

52:05.498 --> 52:06.954
and they're making me
sound like --

52:07.125 --> 52:08.114
Don't worry about it.

52:08.960 --> 52:09.745
[sighs]

52:09.919 --> 52:11.830
I can handle
a little bad press.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.455
I'm more worried
about you.

52:22.348 --> 52:24.555
He's not gonna
get off, is he?

52:27.103 --> 52:29.640
I mean, the truth's got to count
for something, right?

52:32.900 --> 52:33.980
It has to.

52:39.699 --> 52:40.984
[telephone rings]

52:41.200 --> 52:43.361
Cheyenne Legal Aid.
This is Cady.

52:45.246 --> 52:46.361
Mm-hmm.

52:46.581 --> 52:47.912
Yes. Yeah.
Of course.

52:48.082 --> 52:50.915
Um, where are you
currently located?

52:52.754 --> 52:53.618
Okay.

52:54.297 --> 52:55.537
And what have they
charged you with?

52:55.757 --> 52:58.373
[clears throat]
They haven't told you?

52:58.593 --> 53:00.254
Good. That means they don't
have anything on you.

53:00.470 --> 53:03.587
Please don't say another word
to them until I get there, okay?

53:03.765 --> 53:05.721
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't get your name.

53:05.933 --> 53:08.140
Can you -- Can you repeat it?

53:09.729 --> 53:11.685
Darius Burns.

53:11.898 --> 53:13.058
Got it.

53:13.274 --> 53:15.265
Okay. Great.
I'll be right there.

53:40.843 --> 53:43.004
Wait, I know what it feels like
to have a death weigh on you.

53:44.347 --> 53:46.087
I think about Hector
every day.

54:00.613 --> 54:01.523
[tires screech]

54:02.281 --> 54:04.021
And so in a way, yes,

54:04.200 --> 54:07.283
Hector lives as an idea
and a hope.

54:07.495 --> 54:08.985
Is it also possible

54:09.163 --> 54:12.200
that somebody's picking up
Hector's mantle?

54:12.417 --> 54:14.248
Anything is possible.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.622
[papers rustling]

54:25.930 --> 54:27.761
Mathias tried to arrest Joey
for dealing,

54:27.974 --> 54:30.511
but he could never hold him,
so he was frustrated.

54:30.727 --> 54:33.434
Becoming Hector
would get him around all that.

54:33.604 --> 54:35.890
Mathias is not the only one
who is frustrated

54:36.107 --> 54:37.563
with the limit
of reservation law.

54:40.111 --> 54:42.102
[Cady] Since I started
this legal-aid center,

54:42.280 --> 54:44.271
Henry has asked for my help
exactly one time.

54:44.490 --> 54:47.277
He wanted to foster
a Cheyenne child named Mingan.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.528
-Henry's fostering a child?
-No.

54:52.749 --> 54:54.785
Because the boy ended up
killing himself.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.995
[dramatic music plays]

55:15.688 --> 55:16.928
I'll take a Rainier.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.225
Knocking off
a little early today?

55:22.945 --> 55:24.196
Why don't you go ahead
and make it two?

55:24.363 --> 55:27.651
[mid-tempo playing]

55:48.596 --> 55:49.836
Something on your mind?

55:51.766 --> 55:53.597
Cady thinks
I should retire.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.970
Why does she think that?

55:56.604 --> 55:58.640
Apparently, I've been doing
the job for so long

55:58.856 --> 56:01.814
that, uh, it's affecting
my judgment.

56:02.235 --> 56:03.315
Do you agree?

56:03.778 --> 56:04.733
I don't know.

56:05.279 --> 56:06.780
Maybe she's right.

56:08.241 --> 56:11.984
Maybe I can't do the job
the way I used to,

56:12.161 --> 56:13.901
the way I should.

56:14.080 --> 56:16.287
Sometimes I find myself

56:16.499 --> 56:20.788
staring right at the truth
without even seeing it...

56:22.004 --> 56:24.461
...all because
I don't want to see it.

56:27.426 --> 56:28.711
Human nature.

56:34.141 --> 56:37.304
Sometimes...
it's not my fault.

56:38.062 --> 56:39.222
Sometimes I can't see it

56:39.438 --> 56:42.100
because someone else
is hiding it from me.

56:43.192 --> 56:44.648
I feel like you are
now talking about

56:44.861 --> 56:46.101
something very specific.

56:46.863 --> 56:47.943
Uh-huh.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.412
[can crinkling]

57:05.923 --> 57:07.424
Take off your shirt.

57:08.801 --> 57:09.631
What?

57:10.136 --> 57:12.252
If you're who
I believe you are,

57:12.972 --> 57:15.554
you have a bullet wound
somewhere on your body.

57:16.350 --> 57:18.807
I do not think you need
another one of these.

57:19.020 --> 57:20.430
I shot Hector
in the woods,

57:21.147 --> 57:24.105
right near that bonfire
where Gab's rapists were.

57:24.734 --> 57:27.350
We found blood on the ground,
so I knew I hit him.

57:27.820 --> 57:28.935
What are you saying?

57:29.155 --> 57:31.612
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me you're not Hector?

57:33.868 --> 57:35.153
Let go of my arm.

57:35.369 --> 57:36.950
Stop lying to me, Henry.

57:37.121 --> 57:38.827
I'm sick of it.

57:39.373 --> 57:41.830
All I ever do
is try and help people,

57:42.001 --> 57:45.038
and all I ever get in return
is people lying to me

57:45.254 --> 57:46.710
and hiding things.

57:46.881 --> 57:48.246
Has it dawned on you

57:48.466 --> 57:50.081
that sometimes people
do not tell you the truth

57:50.301 --> 57:51.507
because they want to
protect you?

57:51.719 --> 57:52.879
That's a bullshit excuse.

57:53.095 --> 57:54.926
No, that is love.

57:55.139 --> 57:56.879
But you choose to see
it as disloyalty.

57:57.099 --> 57:59.215
Dishonesty is disloyalty.

57:59.435 --> 58:03.474
And breaking the law when lam
the law is absolutely disloyal!

58:03.689 --> 58:06.647
You cannot know what it takes
to fight back the violence

58:06.859 --> 58:09.225
and drugs and
suicides on the res.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.894
Suicides?
Like Mingan Pine's?

58:12.114 --> 58:13.490
Yes, like Mingan.
Now let go of my arm!

58:13.699 --> 58:15.235
I just want to
hear you say it!

58:15.910 --> 58:18.617
Tell me.
Tell me you're Hector!

58:23.376 --> 58:25.332
Why would I trust you
with something like that

58:25.544 --> 58:27.626
when your own daughter
does not trust you enough

58:27.838 --> 58:29.794
to call you after she
has been arrested?

58:29.966 --> 58:31.922
[grunting]

58:40.643 --> 58:41.758
I know it's you!

58:47.358 --> 58:48.438
You are out of control!

58:50.027 --> 58:51.858
[indistinct shouting]

58:57.702 --> 58:59.283
[grunting]

59:15.720 --> 59:17.961
[both grunting]
