00:10.272 --> 00:13.277
- [Amanda] (sighs) Look, I
get that it is late there,

00:13.277 --> 00:15.200
and this sucks,

00:15.200 --> 00:17.440
but this is the only time that
I can sit down and do this.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.180
- [Hugo] Can you cut me a
little slack, just a little?

00:20.180 --> 00:21.530
- [Amanda] There's no slack to give.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.753
Nothing is slacking.
- Just slack me a little.

00:23.753 --> 00:25.173
- Please?
- I can't.

00:27.377 --> 00:28.890
- [Hugo] So you're not mad at me?

00:28.890 --> 00:32.060
- No, I'm not mad, I just,

00:32.060 --> 00:34.530
can you be honest with me
for a second about something?

00:34.530 --> 00:36.178
- Can I be honest with you?
- It's stupid

00:36.178 --> 00:38.060
- I'm always honest with you.
- and I can't believe

00:38.060 --> 00:39.932
I'm asking you this, but--

00:39.932 --> 00:41.443
- What?
(Amanda sighs)

00:41.443 --> 00:43.040
Ask.
- Is this important to you,

00:43.040 --> 00:44.450
like--
- What?

00:44.450 --> 00:47.610
- Us, our relationship,
is it important to you?

00:47.610 --> 00:50.570
- [Hugo] Of course, is
that even a question?

00:50.570 --> 00:53.710
- Good, 'cause it's important to me too,

00:53.710 --> 00:56.590
but that's why we need
to stick to routines.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.620
Routines are like
relationship Gorilla Glue

00:58.620 --> 01:00.720
that keep us stuck together.
- Oh wow, that's--

01:00.720 --> 01:02.630
- What?
- That's, you know, that's,

01:02.630 --> 01:05.190
that's very romantic. (scoffs)

01:05.190 --> 01:06.060
- Yeah.
- What magazine did you

01:06.060 --> 01:09.540
pick that up from?
- I don't know, Cosmo.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.283
- Oh my God, I mean--
- What?

01:11.283 --> 01:14.640
- Come on, Cosmo.
- But I have read

01:14.640 --> 01:16.709
some good articles in Cosmo.
- Cosmo's awful.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.707
- It is not awful.
- So fucking awful.

01:18.707 --> 01:20.060
(Amanda laughs)
What?

01:20.060 --> 01:21.000
- It's not awful.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.340
I've read some good articles.
- It is awful.

01:23.340 --> 01:27.000
I once, look, I once read
an article in Cosmo titled

01:27.000 --> 01:28.830
12 Things Your Dog Is Trying to Tell You

01:28.830 --> 01:30.980
About Your Man's Sex Drive.
(Amanda laughs)

01:30.980 --> 01:31.990
I mean, if that's not
- Okay, fine.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.660
- fucking stupid then you're
gonna have to explain it to me,

01:34.660 --> 01:37.750
because I don't know what
stupid is then, okay.

01:37.750 --> 01:42.750
So stop reading Cosmo, please.
- I'm not going to,

01:42.800 --> 01:44.340
but I get that that article--
- You're not?

01:44.340 --> 01:46.380
- That article was stupid,

01:46.380 --> 01:48.510
but they have a lot of good articles.

01:48.510 --> 01:50.910
- Oh really, I doubt that.
- And I get it, okay.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.503
It's just, it's all we can do right now.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.511
- Why?
- I'm just

01:57.511 --> 01:58.628
trying to, I'm just trying
- I feel like you wanna

01:58.628 --> 01:59.709
tell me something
- to feel like--

01:59.709 --> 02:01.310
but you're not saying.

02:01.310 --> 02:03.543
- I just trying to feel
like we're together.

02:04.690 --> 02:05.700
- [Hugo] You feel what, sorry?

02:05.700 --> 02:07.750
- I just wanna feel like we're together.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.720
We're so, you're so far away it's hard

02:09.720 --> 02:11.210
to feel like we're even--
- We are together.

02:11.210 --> 02:14.863
- No, I mean like in a
relationship together.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.190
- [Hugo] Look, I'm trying.

02:20.190 --> 02:23.034
It's just the Skype thing is
a little inconvenient for me,

02:23.034 --> 02:25.330
just because of work.
- Yeah.

02:25.330 --> 02:26.657
- I'm not--
- I get it.

02:26.657 --> 02:28.520
- [Hugo] But I'm trying, it's not,

02:28.520 --> 02:30.790
don't say it like I'm not trying.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.020
- I'm not, I get it,

02:32.020 --> 02:33.783
you're trying.
- I'm here right now.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.583
- Yeah.

02:38.510 --> 02:39.773
- What?
- Nothing.

02:45.173 --> 02:47.673
- [Hugo] So, so what do we do?

02:54.032 --> 02:54.918
What do we do now?

02:54.918 --> 02:57.501
(gentle music)

04:03.490 --> 04:05.080
- [Robert] I mean, yo, it's the desert,

04:05.080 --> 04:06.570
man, it's the fucking desert.

04:06.570 --> 04:07.830
It's just,
- Yeah.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.290
- it's hot, it's sweaty,
it's like 110 degrees

04:10.290 --> 04:11.600
and it's 8:00 a.m. in the morning.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.620
- Yeah.
- You know, everything here

04:12.620 --> 04:14.210
is melting at all times.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.120
Everything here is in a
constant state of melt.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.149
- This is like one minute you're
in the middle of everything

04:18.149 --> 04:20.079
and then you're kinda like
in the middle of nowhere,

04:20.079 --> 04:21.880
so it's kinda like, oh shit,

04:21.880 --> 04:22.713
what happened, you know what I mean?

04:22.713 --> 04:24.450
- I mean, it really
works a number on people,

04:24.450 --> 04:27.640
that the heat here is enough
to turn sane men crazy

04:27.640 --> 04:28.990
and crazy men into killers.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.860
I feel like when I snap, and
I'm going to snap, maybe soon,

04:33.860 --> 04:36.220
don't worry, I'm not
gonna snap today, okay.

04:36.220 --> 04:39.130
I don't have any kinda knife,
I'm not gonna stick you.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.650
When that thought crosses your mind

04:40.650 --> 04:43.290
as a legitimate possibility of your being,

04:43.290 --> 04:44.890
you need to start seeking help.

04:44.890 --> 04:49.290
I haven't yet, as a matter of fact

04:49.290 --> 04:51.333
I'm on no medications whatsoever,

04:52.510 --> 04:54.180
but I should be.
- Okay.

04:54.180 --> 04:55.190
- So don't worry.

04:55.190 --> 04:58.050
I tell you what, let's flip
the page, let's start anew.

04:58.050 --> 05:00.870
I'm Bobby, you can call me Robert.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.600
I'd prefer it if you called me Robert.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.480
I think it's a much more
suitable name for my stature.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.120
What's your name?
- Hugo.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.220
- Hugo, Hugo, where are you from?

05:10.220 --> 05:12.400
- I'm from Portugal.
- Ah, Portugal.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.440
- Yeah.
- South America,

05:14.440 --> 05:17.940
Argentina, the girl from Ipanema.

05:17.940 --> 05:21.213
- No, it's not a city,
it's a country in Europe.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.800
- You're European?
- Yeah.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.980
- [Robert] That accent does
not sound European at all.

05:26.980 --> 05:28.170
- Oh, my girlfriend lives here.

05:28.170 --> 05:29.010
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:29.010 --> 05:30.310
- [Robert] Girlfriend.

05:30.310 --> 05:32.540
- We're at that stage now, we're gonna,

05:32.540 --> 05:36.010
decided it was time,
we're moving in together.

05:36.010 --> 05:38.073
- [Robert] So long-distance thing?

05:38.073 --> 05:38.906
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.850
- Yeah.
- Long term, long distance.

05:40.850 --> 05:43.434
Those are two wrongs that do
not make a right, my friend.

05:43.434 --> 05:45.794
(Hugo laughs)
What does she look like?

05:45.794 --> 05:48.633
Is she hot, like d'you think
I would find her attractive?

05:49.534 --> 05:52.134
- Yeah, I don't think I'm
comfortable with that question.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.920
- C'mon, man, I'm not, you
know, I'm a visual guy.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.950
When was the last time you guys

05:55.950 --> 05:58.400
were like in the States together?

05:58.400 --> 06:01.531
- Um, probably 10 months ago.

06:01.531 --> 06:03.050
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

06:03.050 --> 06:04.977
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, it's okay.

06:04.977 --> 06:06.743
- It's a long time to be abstinent.

06:07.790 --> 06:08.623
- Yeah.

06:09.560 --> 06:12.929
- But hey, man, but
seriously, it's gonna be fine.

06:12.929 --> 06:14.733
- You think so?
- Yeah, no.

06:14.733 --> 06:16.720
- You think so?
- Yeah, it's totally

06:16.720 --> 06:18.860
gonna work out.
- Thank you.

06:18.860 --> 06:21.350
- Yeah, no, you're on the highway

06:21.350 --> 06:23.522
to a successful relationship.

06:23.522 --> 06:28.522
(cigarette lighter scratching)
(dogs barking)

07:15.950 --> 07:18.533
(gate squeaks)

07:40.499 --> 07:43.210
(outgoing phone call rings)
- Hello?

07:43.210 --> 07:44.770
- Oh, hi.

07:44.770 --> 07:47.440
- [Amanda] Hi, are you
here, did you just land?

07:47.440 --> 07:51.261
- I have a surprise for you,
I think you're gonna like it.

07:51.261 --> 07:53.230
- [Amanda] Hugo, you know
I don't like surprises.

07:53.230 --> 07:54.463
They make me anxious.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.544
- Oh.
- What?

07:58.662 --> 08:00.074
- Uh--
- What?

08:00.074 --> 08:02.363
What is it, just tell me?
- I'm, I'm here.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.280
- Here--
- I'm outside your window.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.843
If you look to your right, yeah.

08:09.943 --> 08:11.401
Hey.

08:11.401 --> 08:14.384
- Hey, I had the feeling
you'd do something like this.

08:14.384 --> 08:17.223
(phone beeps)
(window scrapes)

08:17.223 --> 08:18.223
Ah, I'm soaking wet.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.480
Hi.
- Hey.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.810
- What are you doing here, you told me

08:22.810 --> 08:24.517
you were gonna call?
- I wanted to surprise you.

08:24.517 --> 08:26.301
- I'm all ready to come get you.

08:26.301 --> 08:28.980
- You don't look surprised.
- I'm very surprised.

08:28.980 --> 08:29.993
Trust me, look.
- No, you don't look like it.

08:29.993 --> 08:32.179
- Look how surprised I am.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.890
- You look scared.
- Scared?

08:33.890 --> 08:36.669
- You hate me.
- I don't hate you.

08:36.669 --> 08:40.500
I don't hate you, hey, I love you.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.477
- Come on, jump out the window.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.410
- What? No.
- I'll catch you.

08:42.410 --> 08:43.457
I'll catch you, I promise.
- I'm not gonna jump out

08:43.457 --> 08:45.049
the window, no.
- If you love me,

08:45.049 --> 08:45.898
you'll jump out the window.

08:45.898 --> 08:47.072
I'll catch you.
- I love you, I just

08:47.072 --> 08:48.975
don't think you can catch me.
- I'll catch you, please.

08:48.975 --> 08:49.992
- Come around the front, okay.

08:49.992 --> 08:51.204
- I'll catch you.
- Can't let you in the back,

08:51.204 --> 08:52.037
the door is stuck.
- I'll catch you.

08:52.037 --> 08:52.870
- No.

08:56.390 --> 08:58.057
- Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.763
- Oh hi, come here.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.453
Come here.

09:15.115 --> 09:16.198
I missed you.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.053
- What?
- Nothing.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.000
- Look different.
- I look different?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.110
- Yeah.
- In a bad way?

09:30.110 --> 09:32.023
- I don't know, kinda look terrified.

09:33.100 --> 09:33.933
Yeah.
- What?

09:33.933 --> 09:35.760
- You look terrified.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.740
When I was on top of you,

09:36.740 --> 09:40.063
you kinda looked like Leo
DiCaprio in The Revenant.

09:40.063 --> 09:40.896
You know, the bear part.

09:40.896 --> 09:43.479
- I looked like I was
getting mauled by a bear?

09:43.479 --> 09:45.062
- Uh, a little bit.

09:47.203 --> 09:48.735
- Well, it made you come, right,

09:48.735 --> 09:50.076
so, hey.
- Yeah, pretty quick,

09:50.076 --> 09:52.330
(Amanda laughs)
so you should feel flattered.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.790
You don't?
- No, I do.

09:53.790 --> 09:56.255
- I did about three hours
of Kegels on the plane, too.

09:56.255 --> 09:57.088
- Kegels?
- Yeah.

09:57.088 --> 09:59.080
- I don't think that you
have the right equipment

09:59.080 --> 10:00.510
for that.
- It's in the prostate,

10:00.510 --> 10:03.060
it's strengthening the
prostate through repetition.

10:04.020 --> 10:04.853
- Okay.

10:04.853 --> 10:07.300
- The prostate is the
key that unlocks the door

10:08.870 --> 10:11.520
to the whole male reproductive system.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.234
Why are you judging?
- Where did you read that?

10:13.234 --> 10:14.980
Where did you (laughs) read that?

10:14.980 --> 10:16.800
- On, I dunno, a book.
- That sounds ridiculous.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.350
- I'll show you a photo of one.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.993
- Okay, let's do it.

10:23.384 --> 10:26.120
(laughs) What happened
to your hand, by the way?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.167
It looks really bad all wrapped up

10:28.167 --> 10:29.030
like that.
- It looks bad?

10:29.030 --> 10:31.270
No, nothing, I just banged
it up a bit, it's fine.

10:31.270 --> 10:32.430
- Are you sure?

10:32.430 --> 10:33.263
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:34.820 --> 10:35.653
- It's fine.

10:39.110 --> 10:42.157
- Um.
- Mm.

10:43.377 --> 10:46.580
- On (laughs), on another note,

10:46.580 --> 10:51.500
I invited some friends
over tonight for dinner.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.363
Is that okay?

10:57.030 --> 10:59.030
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.030
- They're really cool and
they're super relaxed.

11:01.030 --> 11:03.610
- Hey babe--
- So you don't need to worry.

11:03.610 --> 11:04.513
- I'm not worried.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.430
- Okay, you just seem kind of upset.

11:08.430 --> 11:11.100
- No, I said fine.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.470
- Okay, I mean, I told
them a lot about you

11:13.470 --> 11:16.397
and they're really
excited to meet you, so.

11:16.397 --> 11:19.117
- Okay, I'm excited to meet them too.

11:19.117 --> 11:19.950
What?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.650
- Okay.
- What were you gonna say?

11:23.650 --> 11:27.020
- Nothing, I have to go back
to the store in a little bit

11:27.020 --> 11:30.030
to get some more ingredients,
if you wanna come.

11:30.030 --> 11:30.863
- Of course.

11:31.826 --> 11:32.659
You don't want me to go?
- Are you sure?

11:32.659 --> 11:33.690
No, I want you to go,

11:33.690 --> 11:36.580
I just want you to know
that you can stay and rest

11:36.580 --> 11:39.100
if you need to.
- I'm fine.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.110
I told you that I'm fine.
- Okay.

11:41.110 --> 11:44.390
- But we're gonna have to have
sex again before we leave.

11:44.390 --> 11:46.120
- Mm--
- 'Cause I don't think

11:46.120 --> 11:47.730
I can move on with my life if we don't.

11:47.730 --> 11:48.960
- Okay.
- I just can't stop

11:48.960 --> 11:50.231
thinking about it. (laughs)

11:50.231 --> 11:53.200
You know, let's say I die
in the next couple of hours,

11:53.200 --> 11:55.640
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to pass on to the next life

11:55.640 --> 11:59.420
knowing that you'll remember
me as a sexual retard.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.290
So--
- Okay.

12:01.290 --> 12:03.730
- I'm gonna mount you again, pretty soon.

12:03.730 --> 12:05.950
- Right now?
- 30 seconds.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.710
- 30 seconds?
- Yeah.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.660
- Okay.
- Do a countdown.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.430
- Countdown to
- Yeah.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.650
- penetration? (laughs)

12:12.650 --> 12:14.020
- To the best sex of your life.

12:14.020 --> 12:16.610
- Oh, okay.
- Oh yeah.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.703
Count.
- Okay, 30,

12:18.703 --> 12:19.910
29--
- You need to get excited.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.464
You're not excited.
- I am.

12:21.464 --> 12:25.300
(clears throat) 27, 26.
- I can do better.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.545
- 25, 24.
- Whew, I love 24.

12:28.545 --> 12:30.733
- 23, 22.
- By the way,

12:30.733 --> 12:33.382
the number 11 arouses me, so make sure

12:33.382 --> 12:35.170
(Amanda laughs)
you hit that one extra hard.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.070
- 21.
- Like it.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.030
- 20.
- Ooh.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.741
- 19.
- Fuck 19.

12:39.741 --> 12:41.582
- 18. (laughs)
- 18.

12:41.582 --> 12:43.001
- 17.
- Ah.

12:43.001 --> 12:44.692
- 16.
- Ah fuck, I just came.

12:44.692 --> 12:45.770
- 15.
- I just came.

12:45.770 --> 12:46.941
- What?
- I just came.

12:46.941 --> 12:49.342
(Amanda laughs)
Now start over.

12:49.342 --> 12:52.447
- Oh my God, okay, fine.
- Start over.

12:52.447 --> 12:55.030
(gentle music)

13:23.614 --> 13:25.147
(Hugo sighs)

13:25.147 --> 13:27.680
- I'm sorry, they keep texting me

13:27.680 --> 13:29.580
asking me if they need to bring anything,

13:29.580 --> 13:31.080
but (laughs) I've told them

13:31.080 --> 13:33.910
like five times already
not to worry about it.

13:33.910 --> 13:34.743
- It's okay.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.020
Tell me more about them.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.410
- Well, what d'you wanna know, I mean,

13:43.410 --> 13:44.651
that's a very broad question?
- You know what

13:44.651 --> 13:46.880
I'm getting at, are they nice, are they--

13:46.880 --> 13:49.530
- I told you already, they're cool.

13:49.530 --> 13:52.280
- Yeah, but being cool doesn't
mean they're not pricks.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.204
Most cool people are pricks
by nature, that's kinda

13:55.204 --> 13:56.860
their thing, you know.
- Okay, then they're nice,

13:56.860 --> 13:59.273
okay, don't worry so much.
- I'm not worried, I'm just--

13:59.273 --> 14:01.260
- I'll be there to protect you.

14:01.260 --> 14:02.093
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.093 --> 14:04.363
- You promise.
- Yes, I promise.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.723
- See that's all it takes,
and now I feel so much better.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.650
- You're not gonna do that in my car,

14:14.650 --> 14:17.370
are you, smoke?
- I can't smoke?

14:17.370 --> 14:18.440
- Just not in my car.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.193
I really hate the smell,
I've always hated it.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.498
- [Hugo] You've always hated it?

14:24.498 --> 14:25.678
Why didn't you tell me?

14:25.678 --> 14:27.360
- I don't know, I guess I
just thought it was a phase.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.280
I thought it was something
that you'd grow out of.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.450
- A phase.

14:30.450 --> 14:33.510
I would have stopped if you asked me,

14:33.510 --> 14:34.840
if you told me.
- I'm not saying

14:34.840 --> 14:36.300
I want you to quit smoking.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.420
I just don't want you to do it in my car.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.301
- Well, good, 'cause I
look cool when I smoke.

14:40.301 --> 14:41.480
- [Amanda] (laughs) You do not look cool.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.640
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you do not.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.883
- You know I do.
- No, you do not.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.770
- I look like Danny Zuko.
- You look?

14:46.770 --> 14:49.793
Okay, who even wants to
look like Danny Zuko?

14:52.160 --> 14:54.423
- I do, me.
- Oh my God.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.273
Why?

14:56.273 --> 14:59.613
- Because John Travolta
is huge in Portugal.

15:00.550 --> 15:01.810
- Okay.
- Actually is.

15:01.810 --> 15:04.390
- I know that you think that you look

15:04.390 --> 15:06.390
brooding and mysterious when you smoke,

15:06.390 --> 15:09.114
but you really just look haggard.

15:09.114 --> 15:11.060
- (laughs) Haggard?

15:11.060 --> 15:12.960
- Yeah, you look like you work at Subway

15:12.960 --> 15:16.064
and you're out by the
dumpster on a smoke break.

15:16.064 --> 15:19.410
- Have you ever thought that
maybe it makes me uncomfortable

15:19.410 --> 15:22.595
that you've never even once
shared a cigarette with me?

15:22.595 --> 15:23.430
(Amanda laughs)

15:23.430 --> 15:24.630
That you've never even tried it?

15:24.630 --> 15:25.850
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

15:25.850 --> 15:30.480
- So you're okay with me killing myself?

15:30.480 --> 15:32.753
- Yeah, I think it's romantic.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.093
- I hate you.

15:48.632 --> 15:51.215
(gentle music)

16:19.360 --> 16:20.400
Aren't you gonna get ready?

16:20.400 --> 16:23.540
- I am, doesn't take me that long.

16:23.540 --> 16:25.453
- God, you guys have it so easy.

16:26.955 --> 16:29.970
(sighs) Just makes sure
you put on something

16:29.970 --> 16:33.651
a little more, um--
- A little more what?

16:33.651 --> 16:34.484
Why don't you tell me?

16:34.484 --> 16:36.620
- You know, a little bit--
- What?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.840
- Nicer than usual.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.210
- Nicer?
- Yeah.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.819
- [Hugo] Like what?

16:42.819 --> 16:45.563
- (sighs) Just anything
other than a T-shirt.

16:46.469 --> 16:48.040
- You don't like my T-shirts?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.010
- I love your T-shirts.

16:49.010 --> 16:49.937
It's not what I'm saying.
- I think I look pretty good

16:49.937 --> 16:53.414
with what I normally wear.
- You look great, I just--

16:53.414 --> 16:55.470
- So what's the problem?

16:55.470 --> 16:56.303
Just be honest with me.

16:56.303 --> 16:58.630
- I think you look extra nice

16:58.630 --> 17:00.530
when you try a little bit, that's all.

17:03.681 --> 17:05.420
- You don't think I try?

17:05.420 --> 17:08.060
- I do think you try, that's
not what I'm trying to say.

17:08.060 --> 17:11.290
I just, we're having people
over for dinner tonight

17:11.290 --> 17:14.130
and I wanted to know if you were gonna

17:14.130 --> 17:15.387
- You know what I think?
- dress up a little bit,

17:15.387 --> 17:16.220
that's all.
- You know what I think?

17:16.220 --> 17:17.349
- What?

17:17.349 --> 17:20.040
- I think it's more about
the fact that you don't think

17:20.040 --> 17:21.310
I care enough about you
- Of course I think

17:21.310 --> 17:22.666
that you care.
- to try and understand

17:22.666 --> 17:26.741
the situation.
- That's not what I mean.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.010
- It just makes me feel bad,

17:28.010 --> 17:30.220
that you don't trust
me to figure things out

17:30.220 --> 17:31.053
on my own.
- I do trust you.

17:31.053 --> 17:32.970
- I'm not a child.
- I know you're not a child.

17:32.970 --> 17:33.803
I'm sorry.
- So why

17:33.803 --> 17:34.636
are you treating me like one?

17:34.636 --> 17:35.790
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.

17:35.790 --> 17:40.493
I just want my friends to see
what I see in you, that's all.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.133
Okay?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.350
I just don't understand why it's so hard

17:48.350 --> 17:51.403
for you to tell me what
pants you're gonna wear.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.470
(gentle music)

17:53.470 --> 17:58.180
- So there's this enclave of
women, right, all ages, races,

17:58.180 --> 18:00.630
everything else you can
think of, under one roof.

18:01.850 --> 18:03.600
This is at the nunnery?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.320
- I mean, it's called a
convent, but you can call it

18:05.320 --> 18:06.153
a nunnery if you want.
- I like nunnery.

18:06.153 --> 18:06.986
- Let's stick with nunnery,

18:06.986 --> 18:07.819
it's better.
- Nunnery is fair game?

18:07.819 --> 18:08.730
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:08.730 --> 18:11.593
Okay, so they're all there
under one roof at the nunnery.

18:13.010 --> 18:15.660
It's a total buffet of sexual deviance.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.970
As far as the number
of gay nuns, who knows?

18:17.970 --> 18:19.960
That's between God and
his daughter-sisters.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.940
Like that's not my business,
I don't know the stats,

18:22.940 --> 18:26.510
but my speculation is there
is a legitimate fuck-ton.

18:26.510 --> 18:28.283
Honestly, when I started
coming to grips with

18:28.283 --> 18:33.210
what my preferences were,
like in my earlier years,

18:33.210 --> 18:35.150
I had this fantasy of
running off to become a nun.

18:35.150 --> 18:36.370
It's only for that reason.
- Oh, really?

18:36.370 --> 18:37.203
- Yeah.

18:37.203 --> 18:41.890
- 'Cause you, 'cause you were
imagining going to the nunnery

18:41.890 --> 18:46.810
and seeing all of these like super sexy

18:46.810 --> 18:48.310
Amazon type--
- No,

18:48.310 --> 18:50.230
I don't think there's necessarily,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.410
it's not like Wonder Woman.

18:51.410 --> 18:55.380
It's more of like a grab
bag of lesbian types.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.290
It's like it's a bag of tools.

18:57.290 --> 18:59.066
Every tool serves a purpose,

18:59.066 --> 19:01.740
(everyone laughs)
like some Rosie O'Donnells,

19:01.740 --> 19:04.620
some lipsticks, some Michelle Rodriguezes,

19:04.620 --> 19:06.380
like it's just all mixture.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.690
- I'm not sure Michelle
Rodriguez is a lesbian.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.110
I also didn't know that you
were into Rosie O'Donnell.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.630
- Why would I not be into Rosie O'Donnell?

19:13.630 --> 19:14.950
- No, there's no reason

19:14.950 --> 19:16.092
you wouldn't be into Rosie O'Donnell,

19:16.092 --> 19:17.070
I just didn't know.

19:17.070 --> 19:18.230
You think she's like a,

19:18.230 --> 19:20.090
you think she's a really good lover?

19:20.090 --> 19:21.970
- Yeah, I do, I think,

19:21.970 --> 19:24.120
I think Rosie O'Donnell's a great fuck.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.410
- So you had this fantasy,
you imagined like,

19:27.410 --> 19:29.480
you know, like a hot nunnery.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.660
And then you were like picturing that

19:31.660 --> 19:33.450
like this is happening in the real world,

19:33.450 --> 19:35.110
that because you were
imagining this fantasy

19:35.110 --> 19:37.100
it was also actually happening somewhere.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.243
- Yes.
- Okay.

19:39.536 --> 19:40.620
How're you doing, Hugo?

19:40.620 --> 19:41.735
- I'm fine.
- Great.

19:41.735 --> 19:43.410
(women all laugh)
- He's great.

19:43.410 --> 19:46.910
- If you, if you at any
time need to, you know,

19:46.910 --> 19:49.170
just, I'll just (clicks),
I'll just (clicks).

19:49.170 --> 19:52.140
- Oh, no no.
- He's fine, he's from Europe.

19:52.140 --> 19:53.390
He's fine, right?

19:53.390 --> 19:55.730
You're from Europe, it's way
more progressive over there.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.870
I don't think it's quite
like that where I'm from,

19:57.870 --> 20:00.480
I don't think, yeah.
- No?

20:00.480 --> 20:01.910
- Yeah, it's a little more conservative

20:01.910 --> 20:03.940
in Portugal than other places.

20:03.940 --> 20:07.190
I think you're thinking
about Scandinavia, probably.

20:07.190 --> 20:11.523
Yeah, over there they share
needles, swap lovers, smoke pot,

20:11.523 --> 20:12.804
and that kind of thing, so.
(both women laugh)

20:12.804 --> 20:14.571
- Smoke pot?
- Yes.

20:14.571 --> 20:16.400
- Ooh.
- It's very liberal.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.580
- So they're like the Sodom
and Gomorrah to your Vatican,

20:18.580 --> 20:20.460
is that what you're saying?
- Oh, you guys,

20:20.460 --> 20:23.040
I'm killing the wine.
- No.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.770
- That is a very big
glass, that's not fair.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.470
You can share that.
(everyone laughs)

20:26.470 --> 20:28.460
- I'll go get more, it's
in the garage, it's fine.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.800
I'll be right back.
- I'll get it.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.633
I'll go.
- No, it's fine, stay.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.055
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:32.055 --> 20:34.070
- Yeah, hang with us.
- Okay.

20:34.070 --> 20:35.610
- We're cool.
- Relax, mingle.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.750
- We're super cool.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.090
- We're gonna take care of you.

20:39.090 --> 20:41.910
So Hugo, I read somewhere
that Portugal has

20:41.910 --> 20:44.162
like the highest divorce rate
of any developed country.

20:44.162 --> 20:45.840
(Tess laughs)
Is that true?

20:45.840 --> 20:48.290
- Yeah, probably, I
don't know, I'm not sure.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.320
- What, no, I find it really interesting

20:51.320 --> 20:53.050
that places that are so conservative

20:53.050 --> 20:55.040
have really high divorce rates.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.680
I think it's like some kind of

20:56.680 --> 20:59.680
psycho-spiritual correlation there.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.630
- Maybe, I don't know. (laughs)

21:02.630 --> 21:04.910
- When are you and Amanda
getting married, any idea?

21:04.910 --> 21:06.870
- Okay, smooth pivot,

21:06.870 --> 21:09.668
very nice segue.
- I tried, I was like.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.218
(Tess laughs)
- No, it's fine.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.650
Yeah, we're just gonna
take it slow, I think.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.100
- Yeah, but you're like on a,

21:19.210 --> 21:20.390
and I don't mean this to pressure you,

21:20.390 --> 21:22.750
but you're like on a one-way street.

21:22.750 --> 21:23.583
- No, yeah,

21:23.583 --> 21:24.679
and that's the plan.
- You know, it's like

21:24.679 --> 21:25.512
you're on--
- And we're just trying to

21:25.512 --> 21:27.490
stay open-minded about the timing,

21:27.490 --> 21:28.840
yeah.
- Okay, all right.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.140
- Then you're like on a one-way street,

21:31.140 --> 21:32.560
you know what I mean?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.100
Like with the Green Card thing,

21:34.100 --> 21:35.524
so that has to compound things.

21:35.524 --> 21:37.000
- Yeah.
- I mean, you like,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.630
I feel like you need to get
used to it here, probably,

21:39.630 --> 21:41.470
and you and Amanda, like you probably need

21:41.470 --> 21:42.757
a second to get your, you know,

21:42.757 --> 21:44.163
to get your groove back.
- Yeah, we're not in a rush.

21:44.163 --> 21:45.360
Yeah.
- And, I mean,

21:45.360 --> 21:46.650
he's only been here for like eight hours.

21:46.650 --> 21:47.663
Give him a break, you know.

21:47.663 --> 21:49.260
- It's just funny chatter.
- No, it's fine.

21:49.260 --> 21:50.830
You're just curious, I understand.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.010
- Yeah.
- I was actually wondering,

21:53.010 --> 21:55.760
how long have you two been together?

21:55.760 --> 21:57.110
- [Tess] Hmm, eight months?

21:59.030 --> 22:01.120
- More like two months
(laughs) then six months.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.050
More like eight months over two years.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.510
It's a long story.

22:04.510 --> 22:05.383
- I fucked a guy.

22:06.220 --> 22:09.530
- Okay, yeah, she fucked a guy, so--

22:09.530 --> 22:12.650
- [Tess] We weren't
technically dating at the time.

22:12.650 --> 22:13.563
- Still hurt.

22:14.490 --> 22:17.170
- So you're not like--
- What?

22:17.170 --> 22:18.970
Oh, like a lesbian?

22:18.970 --> 22:20.979
I mean, right now I am, you know.

22:20.979 --> 22:24.333
I am technically, but I don't,

22:25.490 --> 22:28.653
I think that term is limiting, so I,

22:29.859 --> 22:32.020
I mean, you know, I was
swinging sort of back and forth

22:32.020 --> 22:33.330
on the Kinsey scale for a little while,

22:33.330 --> 22:37.100
but obviously I've swung
in this direction, so.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.160
- What caused that to happen?

22:38.160 --> 22:40.300
Is it just an impulse thing or--

22:40.300 --> 22:42.070
- Everything starts with an impulse,

22:42.070 --> 22:45.260
but I think in this case, you
know, it was about connection,

22:45.260 --> 22:48.370
it was about, you know,
someone specifically.

22:48.370 --> 22:49.870
It was about love.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.357
I love, you know, people, so.

22:54.010 --> 22:55.530
- You love me.
- Yeah, I love this person.

22:55.530 --> 22:59.010
- But you've been in love with men before?

22:59.010 --> 23:01.490
- No, but I think that that's,

23:01.490 --> 23:02.330
I don't think that's because

23:02.330 --> 23:03.163
I couldn't be in love with a man,

23:03.163 --> 23:05.640
it's just 'cause I haven't
met, you know, I hadn't,

23:05.640 --> 23:08.380
I didn't meet the right man.
- Oh.

23:08.380 --> 23:09.840
- You know, like having sex with men,

23:09.840 --> 23:11.760
it sort of did it for me the same way

23:11.760 --> 23:13.443
that having sex with women would.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.710
I mean, it would satisfy a similar urge.

23:16.710 --> 23:18.120
But like I don't think I was ever

23:18.120 --> 23:20.800
really emotionally satisfied with men.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.640
And I think looking
back, I was kind of just,

23:23.640 --> 23:28.123
you know, using men as like,

23:29.420 --> 23:31.410
as like, it's like a dick

23:31.410 --> 23:33.370
is a great sex toy, you know.

23:33.370 --> 23:37.020
- Oh. (laughs)
- So that was, and that was,

23:37.020 --> 23:40.190
that's something that I didn't
realize was true about me

23:40.190 --> 23:42.910
until I started having sex with women.

23:42.910 --> 23:44.893
So, you know,

23:46.610 --> 23:48.340
Anyway. (laughs)

23:48.340 --> 23:49.173
- You're okay?

23:51.167 --> 23:52.767
- I don't wanna talk about this.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.830
I'm sorry, I'd rather not talk about this

23:56.830 --> 23:58.720
right now.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:58.720 --> 23:59.553
- [Laura] No.

24:01.020 --> 24:04.483
- She's kind of sensitive,
but with good reason.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.583
Where's Amanda, she okay?

24:09.625 --> 24:12.958
(Amanda coughs lightly)

24:23.529 --> 24:25.814
(wine bottle shatters)

24:25.814 --> 24:26.647
- Shit.

24:26.647 --> 24:28.680
- [Tess] So it's crazy that
I haven't asked you this.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.650
We've been talking for like 25 minutes.

24:30.650 --> 24:33.930
But what did you do in Portugal?

24:33.930 --> 24:36.900
- Like my job?
- Yeah.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.020
- I didn't do anything
too important, you know,

24:39.020 --> 24:42.610
just odd jobs, construction
and stuff like that.

24:42.610 --> 24:44.345
I went to school for a couple of years.

24:44.345 --> 24:45.430
- Oh.

24:45.430 --> 24:48.670
- But I had to drop out to
take care of some family stuff.

24:48.670 --> 24:50.980
- [Tess] What did you go to school for?

24:50.980 --> 24:54.420
- Classical music with a
focus on classical guitar.

24:54.420 --> 24:58.050
- No way, that's so cool.
- Yeah, I think so.

24:58.050 --> 25:01.517
- Is there anything of yours
we can listen to online?

25:01.517 --> 25:02.470
- No. (laughs)
- No?

25:02.470 --> 25:04.330
- [Hugo] I never put anything up, no.

25:04.330 --> 25:07.030
I haven't played in a while, too, so.

25:07.030 --> 25:09.640
- [Tess] Have you that about
maybe going back to school?

25:09.640 --> 25:11.790
- Maybe, yeah, I'm thinking about that,

25:11.790 --> 25:12.623
yeah, actually.
(bottles slam)

25:12.623 --> 25:15.900
- Sorry it took me so long.
(Amanda laughs)

25:15.900 --> 25:17.210
- Where's the wine? (laughs)

25:17.210 --> 25:19.090
- I guess I drank it all.

25:19.090 --> 25:21.140
So what did I miss, anything interesting?

25:22.560 --> 25:23.980
- Everything.
- No, it was nothing.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.970
We were just talking to Hugo about

25:25.970 --> 25:27.370
what he did back in Portugal

25:27.370 --> 25:30.240
and whether or not maybe he
might go back to school here.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.840
- Oh.
- I'm thinking about that.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.390
I don't know, it just,

25:33.390 --> 25:35.810
there's a lot of things
that I didn't finish

25:35.810 --> 25:39.200
that I sort of look back on
and kinda hate myself for.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.390
So, you know, I just feel
like I owe it to myself

25:42.390 --> 25:44.650
to at least look into it, you know.

25:44.650 --> 25:45.483
- Really?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.600
- Yeah, what do you think?

25:48.600 --> 25:50.124
Why, what do you think I should do?

25:50.124 --> 25:51.126
- [Amanda] (laughs) No, it's not about

25:51.126 --> 25:51.970
what I think you should do.

25:51.970 --> 25:54.170
I mean, we just talked about, you know,

25:54.170 --> 25:55.870
like you helping out, that's all.

25:55.870 --> 25:57.640
- I know.
- Getting a job,

25:57.640 --> 25:58.640
or something.
- That's important to me too.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.460
I'm not--
- And you could do, sorry.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.270
- No, it's--
- But you could do both,

26:03.270 --> 26:04.353
right, I mean--
- Yeah.

26:04.353 --> 26:06.053
- I mean, if that's what makes you happy.

26:06.053 --> 26:08.100
I just want him to do
what makes him happy.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.700
So we can talk about it and
figure it out, you know.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.610
- Of course.

26:13.610 --> 26:15.860
- Yeah, that's what
we're supposed to do, so.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.400
- Well.
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.430
- I don't know what you guys were thinking

26:23.430 --> 26:25.700
about doing after we left,

26:25.700 --> 26:27.990
but we are gonna go to
this really cool bar

26:27.990 --> 26:31.040
that's like almost like a
10-minute walk down the street,

26:31.040 --> 26:32.810
if you guys wanted to come, maybe.

26:32.810 --> 26:35.110
- It's like 10 or 15. (laughs)

26:35.110 --> 26:36.090
It's like 20, but--

26:36.090 --> 26:37.313
- I don't know.
- No, it's not 20.

26:37.313 --> 26:38.450
- It's like a pretty walk.

26:38.450 --> 26:39.630
- 10-ish.
- I think Hugo's

26:39.630 --> 26:41.460
probably too tired, so--

26:41.460 --> 26:43.230
- No, I'm good, we can go, yeah.

26:43.230 --> 26:46.107
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:46.107 --> 26:49.440
(energetic dance music)

27:25.375 --> 27:27.818
(crowd chatting)

27:27.818 --> 27:31.985
(faint confused electronic music)

27:53.657 --> 27:56.907
(man shouting faintly)

28:02.350 --> 28:04.380
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, what's up?

28:04.380 --> 28:05.780
- Amanda told me you
were out here smoking.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.180
I want to smoke but I forgot my light.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.430
- Oh, a lighter.
- Yeah.

28:11.540 --> 28:13.850
I just forget, I don't know
why I forget this stuff,

28:13.850 --> 28:15.200
it's dumb.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

28:21.860 --> 28:22.693
- Thank you.

28:24.230 --> 28:26.873
- Thanks.
(Hugo mumbles)

28:29.790 --> 28:33.113
- You and Laura, you guys are
very cool, you're very open.

28:35.646 --> 28:37.283
- Is that a good, good thing?
- Yeah, it's a good thing,

28:37.283 --> 28:38.116
yeah.
- Yeah?

28:38.116 --> 28:40.080
- It's just, it's something
I need to work on for myself,

28:40.080 --> 28:42.293
so I kinda appreciate it in other people.

28:43.950 --> 28:44.783
Yeah, totally.

28:45.810 --> 28:46.727
- Well, you're pretty cool too.

28:46.727 --> 28:48.820
- Ah, thank you.
(Tess laughs)

28:48.820 --> 28:50.740
- Hey.
- Hey, everything good?

28:50.740 --> 28:52.770
- Yes, fine, I just wanted
to let you guys know

28:52.770 --> 28:54.790
we've found a spot on the patio

28:54.790 --> 28:55.960
round the corner, so.
- Oh, okay.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.626
- Awesome.
- We'll be there in a second.

28:57.626 --> 28:59.310
- Okay, we'll see you when you're done.

28:59.310 --> 29:01.660
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

29:07.408 --> 29:10.590
(faint dance music)

29:10.590 --> 29:13.393
- So what's Portugal's national bird?

29:14.310 --> 29:15.880
- Did you take him to the Strip?

29:15.880 --> 29:17.630
- [Amanda] Oh yeah, last time he was here.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.170
- Wow.
- He had fun.

29:19.170 --> 29:20.859
You had fun, right?
- It's different, yeah.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.480
(everyone laughs)
It's exciting, yeah.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.940
- He liked it. (laughs)

29:24.940 --> 29:26.560
- Yeah, I just don't
remember the specifics,

29:26.560 --> 29:30.060
'cause every time I came
we always ended up taking

29:30.060 --> 29:31.917
small trips to other places.
- Oh, yeah.

29:31.917 --> 29:35.343
- I like to travel.
- Yeah, you do, don't you?

29:37.140 --> 29:38.540
- Yeah, I guess so.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.330
It's probably what brought me to Portugal,

29:40.330 --> 29:41.950
of all places, you know.
- Yeah.

29:41.950 --> 29:45.580
- My mom was so pissed when I told her

29:45.580 --> 29:48.430
I was going to Portugal, like so pissed.

29:48.430 --> 29:50.330
I think she said something to me like,

29:51.337 --> 29:54.240
"Please don't leave me
alone with your father."

29:54.240 --> 29:56.560
- Oh no.
- Like what does that mean?

29:56.560 --> 29:58.500
- Parents say that, I mean it's like

29:58.500 --> 30:00.640
I don't think she was probably serious.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.820
- Uh, I don't know, it was one of those

30:02.820 --> 30:05.550
like, ha ha, I'm just kidding,

30:05.550 --> 30:08.650
but really this is exactly
how I feel moments, you know.

30:08.650 --> 30:11.160
- So your parents are
still together, right?

30:11.160 --> 30:13.340
- Yeah, my parents are still together.

30:13.340 --> 30:15.290
I mean, they're great,
they've done a lot for me,

30:15.290 --> 30:19.900
but just like, don't put
that shit on your kids,

30:19.900 --> 30:20.790
you know what I mean?

30:20.790 --> 30:21.640
- Right.
- Yeah.

30:24.153 --> 30:26.190
What are your parents like?
- But--

30:26.190 --> 30:27.740
- Stop.
- What are they like?

30:27.740 --> 30:29.126
- Yeah.
(Amanda laughs)

30:29.126 --> 30:29.959
- What do you mean?

30:29.959 --> 30:32.890
- Like what fucked up
shit have your parents

30:32.890 --> 30:33.818
done to you,
(Tess laughs)

30:33.818 --> 30:35.370
like our parents have
done to us, basically?

30:35.370 --> 30:37.070
- Yeah, yeah.
- Give us the dirt.

30:38.860 --> 30:40.900
- They're divorced, which
- Oh.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.110
- I know Laura is gonna appreciate.

30:43.110 --> 30:44.033
- I already knew.

30:45.130 --> 30:45.980
- What?
- What?

30:45.980 --> 30:48.370
- [Laura] I knew, I could
tell that you're from divorce,

30:48.370 --> 30:50.240
like you're a child of divorce, I knew.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.321
- How did you know?

30:51.321 --> 30:52.160
- Yeah.
- Because you--

30:52.160 --> 30:55.790
- Like when you first saw him?
- I have like a divorce radar.

30:55.790 --> 30:56.780
- What do you mean?
- What's that?

30:56.780 --> 30:57.722
- You could tell that

30:57.722 --> 30:58.740
his parents were divorced?
- Yeah, I can tell, like

30:58.740 --> 31:00.230
I can tell you're a divorce--
- Just looking at me?

31:00.230 --> 31:02.210
- Like a child of divorce.
- How?

31:02.210 --> 31:04.820
- Just, I mean like--
- Just look at me?

31:04.820 --> 31:07.000
- What, what?
- You can tell.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.020
- Is it my shirt?
- It's not bad.

31:09.020 --> 31:11.550
- No, it's not.
- So it's a dissage?

31:12.561 --> 31:13.394
- I'm not saying that.

31:13.394 --> 31:14.450
- Is it my pineapple shirt?
- His pineapple?

31:14.450 --> 31:17.370
- There are a lot of successful people

31:17.370 --> 31:19.380
that are children of divorce.

31:19.380 --> 31:22.152
Like it doesn't mean
that it's a bad thing.

31:22.152 --> 31:24.050
- What are you doing?
- Like John Wayne,

31:24.050 --> 31:26.580
like Abraham Lincoln, like Ted Bundy.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.810
- What, do you--
Like Sean Diddy Combs.

31:28.810 --> 31:32.190
- Hold on, rewind, did
you just call Ted Bundy

31:32.190 --> 31:34.390
a successful person? (laughs)
- He was successful

31:34.390 --> 31:35.540
at what he set out to do.

31:35.540 --> 31:39.440
And he was hot, he was the
hot serial killer. (laughs)

31:39.440 --> 31:41.238
- [Amanda] Just digging yourself

31:41.238 --> 31:42.071
deeper and twisting it all.
- Did you hear the

31:42.071 --> 31:43.390
other people that I said?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:43.390 --> 31:44.600
- Laura.
- It's not an insult.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.686
- Take it from--
- These are all hot,

31:45.686 --> 31:46.841
these are all good-looking people.

31:46.841 --> 31:48.466
- These are all hot people.
- Yeah right,

31:48.466 --> 31:49.299
you're just saying that he
- I would have--

31:49.299 --> 31:50.290
could be a hot serial killer.
- I would have gone

31:50.290 --> 31:52.150
straight for Abraham Lincoln,

31:52.150 --> 31:52.983
- Hey.
- I'm telling you.

31:52.983 --> 31:55.091
- Oh, me too.
- He abolished slavery.

31:55.091 --> 31:56.470
(Laura and Amanda laugh)

31:56.470 --> 32:01.300
Marfan, heart disease.
- You're into Marfan syndrome?

32:01.300 --> 32:03.370
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.

32:03.370 --> 32:05.840
- Big hands.
- Okay.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.510
- But really, honestly,
like in all sincerity,

32:09.510 --> 32:12.443
and I'm smiling because I
have a disorder. (laughs)

32:12.443 --> 32:14.920
(everyone laughs)
- You're just smiling, just--

32:14.920 --> 32:16.740
- I laugh when I'm uncomfortable.

32:16.740 --> 32:17.740
- Okay.

32:17.740 --> 32:18.900
- [Tess] That's why she's uncomfortable.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.317
- Okay.
- Oh, she

32:20.317 --> 32:21.150
doesn't like to be sincere.
- I'm trying to be sincere.

32:21.150 --> 32:23.050
Honestly, I'm sorry.
- For what?

32:23.050 --> 32:25.820
- 'Cause like your parents
were divorced, like it,

32:25.820 --> 32:27.680
then it fucked you up, like
your life is fucked up,

32:27.680 --> 32:28.513
I'm sorry.
- He's not fucked up.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.753
You're not fucked up, he's not.

32:32.030 --> 32:33.790
- Are they happier now?

32:33.790 --> 32:34.903
- My mom is, yeah.

32:35.904 --> 32:37.063
- [Tess] How about your dad?

32:39.840 --> 32:42.790
- Uh, he died, that's why, probably.

32:42.790 --> 32:47.140
Yeah, he died in the house
he and my mom owned together.

32:47.140 --> 32:50.690
It wasn't paid off, so my
mother's been struggling a bit.

32:50.690 --> 32:54.180
That's actually why I
dropped out of school.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.713
I was just trying to help my mother.

32:55.713 --> 32:57.160
- Oh, man.
- I was actually,

32:57.160 --> 33:02.000
before I came here I was living
with her back at the house,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.167
trying to help her make
the payments, yeah.

33:04.167 --> 33:07.130
But everything is fine now
'cause we lost the house,

33:07.130 --> 33:08.040
which means,
- What?

33:08.040 --> 33:10.630
- which means we don't,
we're not in debt anymore,

33:10.630 --> 33:13.467
which is a good thing, it's a good thing.

33:13.467 --> 33:14.300
- Yeah?

33:14.300 --> 33:15.310
- Did you just thumbs up?
- I promise you,

33:15.310 --> 33:17.510
it's good news, yeah, now we don't have,

33:17.510 --> 33:22.100
we can just move on, yeah.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.253
- Wow, that's a nice thing
you did for your mom.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.973
- Ah, yeah,

33:30.610 --> 33:32.443
I guess, yeah.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.060
- You guess?

33:35.060 --> 33:37.290
- I started to resent
her by the end of it.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.693
- Your mom?
- 'Cause, yeah.

33:39.530 --> 33:40.850
And I feel bad about it.

33:40.850 --> 33:43.063
I just, I'll be, perhaps you'll think

33:43.063 --> 33:44.007
I'm an asshole.
- No.

33:44.007 --> 33:46.174
- No, no, I don't, I mean,

33:48.350 --> 33:50.500
I don't personally think that
you should feel that way.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.370
I don't know why you feel that way.

33:51.370 --> 33:53.790
I mean, that's a tough
situation, you know.

33:53.790 --> 33:54.623
- Yeah, it is.

33:54.623 --> 33:57.260
- Sometimes they can be
real fucking dicks, parents.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.940
- I agree.
(Laura laughs uncomfortably)

33:58.940 --> 34:00.670
See, I just feel like I was the one

34:00.670 --> 34:02.500
making all the sacrifices.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.430
Like she's my mother, but I was the one

34:04.430 --> 34:08.139
kinda giving all the time.
- Yeah.

34:08.139 --> 34:09.610
- I think I just stuck around

34:09.610 --> 34:11.263
out of duty,
- Yeah.

34:12.489 --> 34:15.183
- which probably made
everything worse, so.

34:16.905 --> 34:18.882
Guess I'm just realizing that now.

34:21.237 --> 34:24.360
- You didn't tell me that
you were back at home

34:25.460 --> 34:27.226
when your mom lost the house.

34:28.068 --> 34:30.100
(Amanda laughs uncomfortably)
- I'm telling you now.

34:30.100 --> 34:33.984
I just didn't wanna burden you with it.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.734
- I wouldn't have been burdened.

34:35.734 --> 34:37.484
- I know, just, what?

34:38.630 --> 34:39.505
- I just wish you,

34:39.505 --> 34:40.413
I could have been there.
- Why're you so upset?

34:40.413 --> 34:43.520
- I just wish I could have
been there for you, that's all.

34:44.510 --> 34:48.963
I'm sorry, I think I'm
just being drunk right now.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.554
- You're so, you're fine.
- No, I'm sorry.

34:51.554 --> 34:54.563
I'm fine, I'm totally,
everything's fine, we're fine.

34:56.380 --> 34:59.280
- I just feel like you
think I didn't say anything

34:59.280 --> 35:01.070
just to spite you or something.

35:01.070 --> 35:01.903
It wasn't that.
- Right, no,

35:01.903 --> 35:04.127
that's not it at all.

35:04.127 --> 35:04.980
(Amanda sighs)

35:04.980 --> 35:06.510
- Please don't do that, if something

35:06.510 --> 35:08.420
is bothering you let us talk,
- Do what?

35:08.420 --> 35:10.350
- get it over with.
- I told you, it's fine.

35:10.350 --> 35:14.380
Even if it wasn't, I'm so
done talking about it tonight.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.280
- You're sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.783
- I'm having a hard time
getting a read on you lately.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.700
- Well, did you like them,

35:22.700 --> 35:24.710
at least?
- I did, actually.

35:24.710 --> 35:26.860
- Good, I'm glad.
- I think they're cool.

35:26.860 --> 35:27.693
- They are cool.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.720
- Yes, I enjoyed the conversation.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.528
- Good.
- I did.

35:31.528 --> 35:33.370
- (laughs) Good.
- Okay.

35:33.370 --> 35:34.243
- I'm happy.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.950
- Can I ask you something, though?

35:38.950 --> 35:41.820
- Yeah, what?
- It's gonna sound weird.

35:41.820 --> 35:44.020
- Okay, what did I say?
- How long

35:44.020 --> 35:45.960
have you been hanging out with them?

35:45.960 --> 35:50.090
- Um, I don't know, like
three months, maybe.

35:50.090 --> 35:53.100
I met them at this pottery
class I was taking.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.700
- Do you know a lot of lesbians?

35:56.660 --> 35:57.493
What?

35:57.493 --> 36:00.780
- That's just kind of a weird
question to ask, I mean.

36:00.780 --> 36:02.690
- Just a question.
- Do you have a problem

36:02.690 --> 36:04.090
with lesbians?
- No.

36:04.090 --> 36:06.690
- Did they, did they make you feel

36:06.690 --> 36:09.050
uncomfortable or something?
- No, the opposite.

36:09.050 --> 36:11.333
- I mean, Hugo?
- What?

36:12.540 --> 36:14.020
- They make fun of your pee-pee?

36:14.020 --> 36:18.150
Aw--
- Look, I love lesbians,

36:18.150 --> 36:20.310
all right, they're very
- You love lesbians.

36:20.310 --> 36:23.343
- Utilitarian--
- Wow, you love them.

36:24.580 --> 36:25.413
- Yes.
- Did you just say

36:25.413 --> 36:26.730
utilitarian?
- Yeah, why?

36:26.730 --> 36:28.380
Is my English wrong or something?

36:30.219 --> 36:31.140
(Amanda sighs)
Look, honestly--

36:31.140 --> 36:32.740
- No.
- I just,

36:32.740 --> 36:37.120
I've never seen two really
pretty lesbians together.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.300
Usually there's one
really good-looking one

36:40.300 --> 36:42.340
and one that looks like,

36:42.340 --> 36:45.190
- What does that even mean?
- I know, Crispin Glover.

36:45.190 --> 36:46.490
Usually you only see two
- What does that mean?

36:46.490 --> 36:49.760
- really good-looking
lesbians together in porn.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.488
That was the joke, but--
- Wow.

36:51.488 --> 36:54.500
(Hugo mutters)
- Okay.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.220
- What, it's a joke,

36:56.220 --> 36:58.420
I don't mean it.
- It's not a very funny joke.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.435
I mean, they're my friends.
- Why're you taking it

37:00.435 --> 37:01.328
so seriously?
- That's just like

37:01.328 --> 37:02.490
a really shitty thing--
- It's a joke.

37:02.490 --> 37:03.973
- It's not funny.

37:05.410 --> 37:06.243
Okay?
- Okay, I'm sorry

37:06.243 --> 37:08.297
I'm trying to make you laugh.

37:08.297 --> 37:09.283
I'm sorry.

37:10.239 --> 37:13.678
- (sighs) You're right, I'm sorry, I just,

37:13.678 --> 37:17.230
I think I'm just feeling overwhelmed

37:17.230 --> 37:19.280
from all the excitement today, I'm sorry.

37:20.177 --> 37:21.770
It's so tiring.
- That's fine.

37:21.770 --> 37:23.010
- It's fine, I'm fine.

37:23.010 --> 37:24.063
- Are you sure you're all right?

37:24.063 --> 37:24.920
- Yeah.
- You sure?

37:24.920 --> 37:26.760
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

37:26.760 --> 37:27.840
- Yes, I'm--
- Are you?

37:27.840 --> 37:30.490
- I'm sorry, I'm fine.
- You sure?

37:30.490 --> 37:32.250
- Oh God, I'm not.
- What?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.208
Ooh.
(vomit splashing)

37:33.208 --> 37:34.041
(Amanda coughing)

37:34.041 --> 37:35.541
Okay, don't worry.

37:36.583 --> 37:39.163
- [Amanda] Just don't
look, it's so gross. (sobs)

37:39.163 --> 37:42.430
- I'm not looking, I'm
here but I'm not looking.

37:42.430 --> 37:43.475
Don't worry.
- Just step back,

37:43.475 --> 37:44.717
I don't wanna get it on your shoes, okay.

37:44.717 --> 37:49.163
- Ah, don't worry, I put
Scotchgard on 'em, so have at it.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.500
A little too much to drink, huh?

37:53.445 --> 37:55.450
(laughs) I'm here, don't worry.

37:55.450 --> 37:57.473
(gentle music)

37:57.473 --> 38:01.143
You all right?
- Yeah.

38:01.143 --> 38:02.310
- Sure?
- Yeah.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.331
- Sure?
(Amanda coughs)

38:05.331 --> 38:07.030
Oh!
(vomit splashes)

38:07.030 --> 38:09.613
(gentle music)

38:13.185 --> 38:14.414
- Sorry.

38:14.414 --> 38:16.997
(Hugo mumbles)

38:17.919 --> 38:19.410
- Gimme a kiss.
- Oh no. (laughs)

38:19.410 --> 38:22.393
- Please?
- Oh no, oh please, no.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.640
- Sorry.
- What?

38:40.640 --> 38:43.059
- I just got a little
bit woozy first again.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.154
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

38:45.154 --> 38:46.893
- You want something?
- Mm, could you distract me?

38:50.266 --> 38:53.016
- (laughs) What?

38:54.380 --> 38:57.880
- [Amanda] I mean like
do something silly or--

38:57.880 --> 38:59.560
- Like a face or something?

38:59.560 --> 39:01.420
- [Amanda] No, like, uh, hmm.

39:03.470 --> 39:04.330
- What?
- Like talk to me

39:04.330 --> 39:05.743
in Portuguese or something.

39:08.121 --> 39:09.083
- [Hugo] What am I gonna say?

39:09.083 --> 39:11.810
- I don't know, something nice.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.193
- Something nice?
- Yeah.

39:19.671 --> 39:21.901
- Okay, I think I got something.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.847
- Okay.
- I should, I'm Portuguese.

39:35.830 --> 39:38.380
That's it.
- That's it?

39:38.380 --> 39:43.120
Come on, keep going.
- Um, I think

39:46.050 --> 39:49.750
we haven't talked with
each other for a long time,

39:49.750 --> 39:51.663
at least not like this.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.113
I'm sorry. (laughs)

40:10.281 --> 40:11.357
Are you enjoying this?
- Yeah.

40:11.357 --> 40:12.190
- Okay.

41:13.421 --> 41:14.970
(laughs) That's it,

41:14.970 --> 41:16.060
I don't know.
- Is that it?

41:16.060 --> 41:17.000
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.199
All I got was something

41:18.199 --> 41:19.380
about love.
- I said that I love you,

41:19.380 --> 41:20.830
that's it.
- No, come on.

41:20.830 --> 41:23.150
You said a lot more than that.

41:23.150 --> 41:24.391
What did you say?
- Now you say something

41:24.391 --> 41:27.928
in Portuguese.
- No. (laughs)

41:27.928 --> 41:29.876
- Say something.
- No, I don't want to.

41:29.876 --> 41:31.820
- Now say something.
- No.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.020
- You remember anything?

41:34.703 --> 41:37.573
You don't?
- No, I do, okay, um.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.172
- What, say that again?

41:53.060 --> 41:54.070
- What are you trying to say?

41:54.070 --> 41:56.859
- One coffee, please?
- Oh.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.632
- Oh, I get it, it's good.

42:00.632 --> 42:01.710
- It's right?
- You still got it.

42:01.710 --> 42:03.423
Yeah, good for you.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.600
What?
- I don't believe you.

42:09.600 --> 42:14.210
- You--
(Amanda laughs)

42:14.210 --> 42:17.996
- Is my Portuguese that bad?
- What?

42:17.996 --> 42:21.413
- My Portuguese that bad?
- No, it's good.

42:22.546 --> 42:23.379
- Aargh.

42:25.746 --> 42:28.079
- Ah, you remember that one.

42:38.954 --> 42:41.787
(toilet flushing)

42:49.097 --> 42:52.566
(Amanda speaking faintly)

42:52.566 --> 42:55.483
(Amanda sniffling)

44:02.530 --> 44:05.113
(Amanda sighs)

44:25.004 --> 44:27.723
(crickets chirping)

44:27.723 --> 44:31.491
(thunder roars faintly)

44:31.491 --> 44:34.241
(birds tweeting)

45:25.970 --> 45:29.303
(guitar briefly strums)

45:36.579 --> 45:39.496
(guitar strumming)

45:55.682 --> 45:59.015
(hesitant guitar music)

46:55.299 --> 46:58.550
(Amanda sniffs)

46:58.550 --> 47:00.889
What is it, just say it?

47:00.889 --> 47:01.850
(Amanda groans softly)

47:01.850 --> 47:02.693
Come here, hey.
- Say what?

47:02.693 --> 47:03.693
- Hey, look at me.

47:06.803 --> 47:10.423
(Amanda laughs)
What, why're you laughing?

47:13.377 --> 47:16.383
Amanda, you're so quiet,
it's really scaring me.

47:17.720 --> 47:21.547
Please say something, just say it.

47:22.890 --> 47:23.723
What?

47:29.890 --> 47:31.593
- I was with somebody else.

47:38.950 --> 47:39.783
- Okay.

47:42.590 --> 47:43.423
Who is he?

47:44.920 --> 47:45.753
Who is he?

47:49.170 --> 47:52.697
- She, it was a she.

48:01.730 --> 48:04.813
- Is or was a she?
- Is.

48:15.498 --> 48:18.165
(Amanda sniffs)

48:21.869 --> 48:22.702
I'm sorry.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.760
I need you to know how I feel.

48:26.760 --> 48:29.663
- Why, it's gonna make me feel better?

48:30.630 --> 48:31.960
Knowing that you feel like shit?

48:31.960 --> 48:33.453
- [Amanda] No.

48:33.453 --> 48:34.580
- I'm not gonna give you that closure.

48:34.580 --> 48:38.143
- It's not about closure.
- Then what is this about?

48:40.080 --> 48:42.780
I came here under the impression

48:42.780 --> 48:44.570
that we're gonna get married,

48:44.570 --> 48:49.570
until you called me up one
night, crying, (exhales heavily)

48:50.710 --> 48:53.650
telling me that you, that you
couldn't go through with it,

48:53.650 --> 48:58.530
that you wanted to wait
and see once I got here,

48:58.530 --> 49:00.220
and I'm fine with that.

49:00.220 --> 49:04.133
I would never pressure you to do anything.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.850
- Do you even care it was a girl?

49:09.750 --> 49:11.243
- Guy, girl, doesn't matter.

49:24.228 --> 49:25.728
Why, are you gay or something?

49:30.060 --> 49:31.133
- I don't think so.

49:32.780 --> 49:33.975
- How don't you know?

49:33.975 --> 49:35.693
- I'm not, okay.

49:36.970 --> 49:37.803
- So you're bi?

49:39.360 --> 49:40.423
- Yeah, I think so.

49:43.130 --> 49:44.430
- How long have you known?

49:46.000 --> 49:49.944
Were you planning on telling me, were you?

49:49.944 --> 49:53.093
Just say something,
anything, just help me.

49:55.150 --> 49:57.000
Amanda.
- What?

49:57.000 --> 49:59.313
What do you want me to say?
- Everything.

50:01.900 --> 50:05.550
- Okay, I met her through
Tess at a concert,

50:05.550 --> 50:07.190
and we--
- You fucked each other?

50:07.190 --> 50:10.400
- No, not then, we just had a few drinks,

50:10.400 --> 50:13.520
and we got along and we
started to spend time together,

50:13.520 --> 50:16.513
and it just kind of happened.

50:19.660 --> 50:21.933
Kind of like how you and I happened.

50:38.484 --> 50:39.430
- That might be true,

50:39.430 --> 50:44.070
but I really wish you didn't say that.

50:58.743 --> 51:01.326
(gentle music)

51:25.901 --> 51:29.401
(people speaking faintly)

51:44.880 --> 51:47.053
- Yo.
- What's up?

51:48.420 --> 51:50.153
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

52:01.939 --> 52:03.539
Can I have it back?
- Cool man.

52:05.370 --> 52:07.053
Fuck, it's hot out here.
- Yeah.

52:08.730 --> 52:11.400
- What's your name, man?
- Hugo, you?

52:11.400 --> 52:13.223
- Rodney.
- Nice meeting you.

52:13.223 --> 52:14.623
- Nice to meet you too, man.

52:16.980 --> 52:18.570
Fuck you doing out here all casual, man?

52:18.570 --> 52:20.071
You ain't got no place to be?

52:20.071 --> 52:21.210
- Just trying to get away.

52:21.210 --> 52:23.310
Yeah, don't really have a place to be now.

52:24.460 --> 52:25.680
- Kinda accent is that, man?

52:25.680 --> 52:27.230
Sound like you're from Albania.

52:28.790 --> 52:30.907
- (Scoffs) Not from Albania, no.

52:30.907 --> 52:33.240
- You're running from home,
who're you running from?

52:33.240 --> 52:34.390
- [Hugo] My girlfriend.

52:35.380 --> 52:37.230
- She's beating you or something?

52:37.230 --> 52:40.150
- Yeah, I don't really
wanna talk about that.

52:40.150 --> 52:41.920
- You're out here chilling, it's hot.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.063
- It is hot.
- We're like friends now, man.

52:43.063 --> 52:44.917
Come on, man, spit it out.

52:47.320 --> 52:49.353
- My girlfriend has been seeing someone.

52:50.420 --> 52:52.303
- You know the dude?
- It's a girl.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.200
- Okay, that's kinda progressive.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.450
- Yeah, guess my girlfriend
has a girlfriend.

53:00.310 --> 53:01.270
It's kinda fucked up.

53:01.270 --> 53:03.020
- Shit, I'm just kinda wondering
how you got her to do it.

53:03.020 --> 53:03.930
I've been trying to get my girl

53:03.930 --> 53:05.990
to sleep with another girl for years, man.

53:05.990 --> 53:07.770
Shit, I even offered to pay her ass.

53:07.770 --> 53:09.410
- It's kinda complicated.

53:09.410 --> 53:10.910
- Sounds like some Maury Povich,

53:10.910 --> 53:12.058
some reality show shit there.

53:12.058 --> 53:13.100
- What's that?

53:13.100 --> 53:14.350
- Oh, you never heard of Maury Povich?

53:14.350 --> 53:15.580
- No.
- So basically,

53:15.580 --> 53:16.640
if the bitch wants to embarrass you

53:16.640 --> 53:18.230
by telling you the kid ain't yours,

53:18.230 --> 53:20.570
instead of telling you
face to face in private,

53:20.570 --> 53:23.140
she takes you on national TV and shit.

53:23.140 --> 53:24.190
Then Maury fucks her.

53:27.430 --> 53:29.580
You ever heard that story
about the lady that cut

53:29.580 --> 53:31.150
her husband's penis off?
- No.

53:31.150 --> 53:33.530
- He was laying there dead asleep, right.

53:33.530 --> 53:36.130
Cut his dick off, hopped in the car,

53:36.130 --> 53:38.720
drove down the street, threw
that shit out the window

53:38.720 --> 53:40.610
into somebody else's yard, right.

53:40.610 --> 53:41.810
Now, but here's the thing, though.

53:41.810 --> 53:42.820
They got his penis back.

53:42.820 --> 53:45.500
- So like I have a huge hole
where my dick used to be.

53:45.500 --> 53:47.738
Kind of feel like dickless.

53:47.738 --> 53:49.165
Do I look dickless to you?

53:49.165 --> 53:50.710
- A little bit, man,
you need your dick, man.

53:50.710 --> 53:52.130
- Do I?

53:52.130 --> 53:53.373
You're very perceptive.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.680
You're a good guy.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.170
- I'm trying to catch this bus, man.

53:58.170 --> 53:59.700
You ain't possibly got like three bucks

53:59.700 --> 54:01.920
I can get off of you, man?
- Oh yeah, I got ya.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.265
- I know it sounds fucked up
but I mean, you know, it's

54:03.265 --> 54:04.465
- No, it doesn't, it's fine.
- kinda hard out here, man.

54:04.465 --> 54:06.273
- [Rodney] Ah man, appreciate that.

54:12.620 --> 54:13.453
- [Hugo] Here.

54:17.810 --> 54:19.510
- Hey man, I kinda fucked up, man,

54:20.494 --> 54:21.710
it's actually five bucks, man.

54:21.710 --> 54:23.230
I know the buses went up and everything.

54:23.230 --> 54:24.780
My bad, I fucked up, it's five.

54:27.060 --> 54:28.840
Oh man, can I get $5 from you, man?

54:28.840 --> 54:30.640
I mean, I don't make the bus prices.

54:32.680 --> 54:34.240
- Fuck, are you shaking me down?

54:34.240 --> 54:35.590
- [Rodney] No, why I
gotta be shaking you down?

54:35.590 --> 54:37.020
- It feels like it.
- Man, that's racist, man.

54:37.020 --> 54:37.897
- No, it's not.
- So why d'you

54:37.897 --> 54:38.730
have to make it a race thing?

54:38.730 --> 54:39.563
- I'm not making it a race thing,

54:39.563 --> 54:40.530
you're making it a race thing.

54:40.530 --> 54:41.820
- Look at you, man, you're already feeling

54:41.820 --> 54:42.653
all uncomfortable and shit.
- No, I'm not.

54:42.653 --> 54:44.130
- I didn't even do anything, man.

54:44.130 --> 54:46.920
You could have just said no.
- Okay, no then.

54:46.920 --> 54:47.753
- But see, it don't
work like that, though.

54:47.753 --> 54:50.160
So now you're being an Indian giver.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.150
- That's racist.

54:51.150 --> 54:53.207
- Look, man, I just need ten bucks.

54:53.207 --> 54:55.500
You said you just gonna help me out.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.890
- Now it's 10, okay.
- It's 10.

54:57.890 --> 54:59.803
- Got it, just take it, I don't care.

55:01.620 --> 55:02.883
Fucking take it, boom.

55:03.930 --> 55:04.763
Fuck!

55:09.320 --> 55:10.390
- Man, I don't even want the money

55:10.390 --> 55:13.000
if it's gonna be like that.
- I don't want it back.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.249
- No man, go ahead, just take the money.

55:14.249 --> 55:15.082
[Hugo] - No, you take it.

55:15.082 --> 55:15.915
- I think you need this shit, man.

55:15.915 --> 55:16.748
- [Hugo] I don't want it.

55:16.748 --> 55:17.750
- Look, man, you got shit
going on with your girl.

55:17.750 --> 55:18.583
You probably wanna buy

55:18.583 --> 55:19.416
- No, don't worry about that.
- a couple of lap dances

55:19.416 --> 55:20.830
or some shit.
- No, I'm good, you take it.

55:20.830 --> 55:21.770
- No, come on, man.

55:21.770 --> 55:23.350
Like I don't know if you
do meth or some shit,

55:23.350 --> 55:25.153
but you probably need it for some meth.

55:26.620 --> 55:27.453
Go ahead, man,

55:27.453 --> 55:29.240
take the money back.
- Actually, I might need it.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.290
Not for meth, though.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.610
Maybe we can share it,
d'you wanna share it?

55:35.610 --> 55:38.410
Oh no, d'you need some meth?

55:38.410 --> 55:39.260
- [Rodney] No, I don't need no meth,

55:39.260 --> 55:40.760
but I need that money, though.

55:54.493 --> 55:57.076
(gentle music)

56:00.352 --> 56:04.852
- [Train Announcer] Next
stop, Caesars Palace Station.

56:25.580 --> 56:29.080
(crowds chatting faintly)

56:42.047 --> 56:44.797
(door squeaking)

56:46.689 --> 56:49.356
(door slamming)

56:51.607 --> 56:52.940
- [Amanda] Hugo?

56:55.497 --> 56:57.397
- Just relax, right.
- Are you drunk?

56:58.240 --> 57:00.040
You know what, just get out.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.250
I can't even talk to you
now, you're just gonna

57:02.250 --> 57:03.262
run off and get drunk.
- The fuck did you expect me

57:03.262 --> 57:04.180
to do, huh?
- I don't know,

57:04.180 --> 57:06.600
not run and hide like a child.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.594
Maybe I thought you'd
stay and actually talk

57:08.594 --> 57:10.700
to me about this.
- Okay, now you wanna talk.

57:10.700 --> 57:11.740
Only took you three
months, but let's talk.

57:11.740 --> 57:15.330
- So it's okay when you
keep things from me, but not

57:15.330 --> 57:16.638
if it's the other way round?
- It's not the same thing.

57:16.638 --> 57:17.640
It's not the same thing.
- What about your mom?

57:17.640 --> 57:19.605
You didn't tell me that
she lost the house.

57:19.605 --> 57:20.438
- It's not the same thing.
- You didn't tell me

57:20.438 --> 57:21.838
that you were staying with her,

57:21.838 --> 57:24.310
and that you were helping her out.

57:24.310 --> 57:25.723
- It's not the same thing.

57:26.795 --> 57:28.840
How could you even say that?

57:28.840 --> 57:30.860
It's not the same thing.
- I wish I could've been there

57:30.860 --> 57:34.050
for you, but you said that
you didn't wanna burden me.

57:34.050 --> 57:36.120
When did you decide that you just didn't,

57:36.120 --> 57:38.583
you couldn't confide in me anymore?

57:41.890 --> 57:44.710
And you might not wanna
hear this right now,

57:44.710 --> 57:46.670
but you've pulled away
from me just as much

57:46.670 --> 57:49.080
as I've pulled away from you.
- That's not true.

57:49.080 --> 57:51.100
It's not true.
- I made a big mistake.

57:51.100 --> 57:55.723
I really fucked up and I feel
really shitty that I hurt you.

57:57.910 --> 57:59.993
- Okay.
- But I,

58:03.020 --> 58:04.467
I just, I needed--

58:08.100 --> 58:08.933
- [Hugo] But what?

58:08.933 --> 58:11.920
If you feel the need to
use the word but after it,

58:11.920 --> 58:16.920
then it wasn't a mistake,
right, it wasn't.

58:20.120 --> 58:21.300
- Yeah, it wasn't a mistake,

58:21.300 --> 58:22.340
okay?
- Okay, good.

58:22.340 --> 58:23.173
Thank you.
- Is that what you

58:23.173 --> 58:24.263
wanted to hear?
- Yeah,

58:24.263 --> 58:25.520
in honesty.
- It wasn't a mistake.

58:25.520 --> 58:28.930
- Yeah, thank you, good.

58:28.930 --> 58:31.650
Thanks for being honest.
- I met her and I felt

58:31.650 --> 58:34.163
something that I hadn't felt before, okay?

58:35.347 --> 58:38.430
- Oh, okay.
- And I needed to explore that

58:38.430 --> 58:40.850
because if I didn't it would feel like

58:40.850 --> 58:43.250
I was fucking betraying myself.

58:43.250 --> 58:48.050
And I couldn't be with
you and do this for real

58:49.970 --> 58:52.276
without knowing what that was.

58:52.276 --> 58:54.387
So that's--
- So you did it for me?

58:54.387 --> 58:58.137
That's what you're
saying, you did it for us.

58:59.947 --> 59:02.130
Okay, you did it, and now what?

59:02.130 --> 59:04.790
- It's like you meet
somebody and they're new

59:04.790 --> 59:07.793
and they're different and it's exciting.

59:08.950 --> 59:11.943
And it's fucking, (laughs)
it's fucking scary, okay?

59:14.790 --> 59:17.560
- What, you weren't feeling that for me?

59:17.560 --> 59:19.430
- I didn't wanna feel like it was

59:19.430 --> 59:21.563
following me around my whole life.

59:24.150 --> 59:26.960
I felt like I needed to explore that

59:26.960 --> 59:29.560
before I moved forward with you

59:29.560 --> 59:32.680
so that it didn't just come up later.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.863
- Where do I fit in now?

59:37.070 --> 59:38.723
Do you still even wanna do this?

59:45.870 --> 59:47.660
- Do you even know what you want?

59:47.660 --> 59:49.090
- I just wanna talk about it.

59:49.090 --> 59:50.823
I wanna figure it out with you.

59:52.990 --> 59:55.110
- Do you wanna be in love with me?

59:55.110 --> 59:57.540
- I think that distance makes you forget

59:57.540 --> 59:59.350
about things, about how you feel.

59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.831
And I, I'm just trying to,

01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:05.303
I'm just trying to remember.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.683
I don't know.
- Who is she?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.560
- [Amanda] What?

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.010
- I wanna meet her, who is she?

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.530
- Her name is Marta.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.585
- Okay, good.
- Why do you

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:23.418
wanna meet her?
- Can you call her up?

01:00:23.418 --> 01:00:24.343
- Don't you think
- I just think it's

01:00:24.343 --> 01:00:25.176
a good idea
- that's a terrible--

01:00:25.176 --> 01:00:26.344
- if she comes by
- Don't you think that's

01:00:26.344 --> 01:00:27.330
just gonna piss you off?
- and we can talk this out.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:30.710
Maybe, I don't know, probably,

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.970
or it's just the best idea I've ever had.

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:35.702
I don't know, do you have a better idea?

01:00:35.702 --> 01:00:38.243
- No.
- Okay, so call her up.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.980
You love her, maybe I'll
love her, I don't know.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.590
- What does that mean?
- It's the new millennium,

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:45.190
the Mormons do it, I don't know.

01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:50.960
Can you call her up?
- When?

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.123
- Now, tonight.

01:00:55.143 --> 01:00:56.490
(gentle music)

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:58.630
- Whole situation is bizarre.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.763
Uh, (laughs) tonight if you're not busy.

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:11.190
Okay, great, thank you, it means a lot.

01:01:14.345 --> 01:01:15.178
Okay, bye.

01:01:20.065 --> 01:01:20.898
There.

01:01:22.575 --> 01:01:25.325
(Marta knocking)

01:01:30.966 --> 01:01:33.549
(door squeaks)

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:50.590
- So, Marta, right?
- Yeah.

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:52.310
Am I saying that right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.600
- Pretty name, I like it.
- Thanks.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.923
- Sounds like a car.

01:01:57.906 --> 01:02:00.490
- (laughs uncomfortably)
I like your accent.

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:02.493
- Oh, thank you, I appreciate it.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.700
- Yep, I am.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.193
That's kinda weird, no?
- Yeah.

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.393
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:02:22.527 --> 01:02:23.540
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:28.540
- Okay, okay, I guess my
accent is hard to pin down.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.410
- This is so fucked up.
- Do you know who

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:33.580
Crispin Glover is?
- No.

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.413
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

01:02:34.413 --> 01:02:37.350
- If it's any consolation, you're a lot,

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.160
like a lot prettier than he is.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.770
So, you know, good on you, Amanda.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:45.260
Look, I just, I know this is kinda weird,

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.980
it's kind of awkward, it
feels like a special event,

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.630
but I do appreciate you coming over.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:57.430
You know, it takes balls,
balls that you obviously have.

01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:58.940
- Okay, Amanda told me it was important

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.320
and I wanna support her,

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.100
so here I am, yeah.
- Good, good on you.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.290
All right, I have a
question, can I ask it?

01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:07.993
Yeah, of course.
- Right, are you a lesbian?

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:12.110
- Hugo!
- No, Amanda, it's okay.

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:12.943
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:12.943 --> 01:03:15.290
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Why are you--

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:19.020
- I'm not sure, and, I don't
know, probably I'm a little,

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.877
but I like to think I'm
a bit more open-minded

01:03:20.877 --> 01:03:21.760
than that, you know.
- How the fuck

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.975
aren't you sure?

01:03:22.975 --> 01:03:25.870
Ever since I've been here it seems

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:28.430
like the thing here, no one knows.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.510
Okay, I have an idea.

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:30.920
Let's just, you know, let's think

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.090
about all the relevant possibilities.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:35.940
We can nail them up on that wall,

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.690
and then just fucking throw darts at it.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:39.810
- I like Amanda a lot.
- Okay.

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.270
- And I'm very attracted to her.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.940
And honestly, I'm jealous of you, Hugo,

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.590
that you've had her in your life for,

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.243
what, how many years now?

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.830
- Four.
- Four years.

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.000
- Yeah.
- That's good.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:53.960
- [Hugo] It's a very long time.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.735
- What are you getting at, Hugo?

01:03:55.735 --> 01:03:59.210
- Do you apologize?
- Honestly, I don't wanna be

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.960
your enemy, Hugo.
- I'd don't wanna be

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.220
your enemy either.
- I don't want you to think

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.550
that I turned your
girlfriend this way, okay?

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:06.740
There's no lesbian voodoo

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.930
or whatever you wanna
think's going on here.

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:13.593
- Yeah, I mean, we have something.

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.640
I understand why he's upset.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.370
Honestly, I'm kind of upset with myself.

01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:21.300
- Now I think you're being

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.320
a little too hard on yourself, you know.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.170
- Well, it seems pretty reasonable to me.

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:29.710
- Amanda, listen, I bet you've
been having these feelings

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:31.840
for as long as you can
remember, all right.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.550
And what you're doing right now is just

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:35.440
you're feeling your way through
them, and that's normal.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.813
- Again, not that normal.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.813
- Okay, fine, not that normal.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:42.650
But you know what?

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:47.530
I've been through it too, and it was a,

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:48.950
(laughs) I mean,

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:51.363
it was a really tough
part of my life, you know.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.150
But I just needed to go through it.

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:59.570
And, yeah, I'm sure I hurt people,

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:03.970
and maybe it was really selfish of me,

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:08.970
but, I mean, I know in my
heart that living with myself

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:13.620
would be something that
would've been really tough,

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.453
and,

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.580
and now I'm grateful, you know,

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.590
I'm grateful I can look
myself in the mirror

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:24.830
and I finally know who I am.

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:26.783
And, (sighs)

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.430
and look, Amanda,

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:35.083
I don't think you have a
responsibility to either one of us.

01:05:38.918 --> 01:05:41.501
(Amanda sighs)

01:05:43.558 --> 01:05:44.391
- Aargh.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.653
I appreciate what you're saying.

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:52.850
It's just, I don't think that it

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:55.440
really is the same situation.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.430
I did something really bad, you know.

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.820
I was in a relationship

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.313
and I crossed boundaries
that I shouldn't have.

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:07.693
And I did things that
I knew would hurt you.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:14.210
I'm sorry, I just felt like
over the past couple of years

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:16.540
I was complacent in our relationship,

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.720
and I got bored and I
just started to think

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.010
about things that might excite me again.

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:26.330
You know, and then I met
Marta and I started to feel

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.423
those things that I felt
when you and I first met.

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:37.773
- Okay, so what happens now?

01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:50.290
- I don't, I'm, fuck,

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:54.253
um, I'm sorry.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.640
I just, I think that I want, Hugo,

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.053
to try to work on our relationship.

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:10.690
I hope that you don't
feel that I led you on,

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:12.913
'cause that wasn't my intention.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.993
Are you okay?

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:23.400
- Um, yeah, yeah, I am,

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.033
um, I understand.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.200
Um, I'm just getting out now, okay.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.963
- Where, uh, Marta, hold on a second.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.530
Why did you say it like that?

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:37.363
- What, that I wanted

01:07:37.363 --> 01:07:38.196
to work things out?
- Why did you say it

01:07:38.196 --> 01:07:39.173
like you're falling on a sword?

01:07:39.173 --> 01:07:41.333
- I don't understand, I told you

01:07:41.333 --> 01:07:43.070
that I was trying to fix things

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.370
and now you're gonna crucify me for it?

01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:46.273
- Look--
- What do you want?

01:07:46.273 --> 01:07:48.083
- If you wanna be with her, be with her.

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:52.570
I just want you to want
to be with me, all right?

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.963
- I don't think it's that simple.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.453
I'm sorry if you do.

01:07:59.453 --> 01:08:00.840
- I don't want you to feel obligated

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.313
to be in a relationship.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.200
That's all I want.

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:12.270
- Break up with me, just fucking do it.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.770
I don't wanna prevent you

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.279
from finding something that's perfect,

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:18.670
and this is pretty
fucking far from perfect

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:20.660
right now, don't you think?

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.493
What do you think?

01:08:21.493 --> 01:08:23.840
Do you think that he
should break up with me?

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.800
I don't think that I can
give you what you want

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.399
or tell you what you wanna hear.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.643
So just do it.

01:10:10.119 --> 01:10:15.119
- Whoa. (breathes deeply)
