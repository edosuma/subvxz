01:15.600 --> 01:20.101
Long ago,
the Arakacians ruled the galaxies.

01:21.001 --> 01:24.101
Horror and devastation lay in their wake.

01:25.301 --> 01:27.802
The source of their terrifying power...

01:27.902 --> 01:31.602
lay within a chamber on planet Uroboris.

01:32.403 --> 01:37.903
The waters it contained
held the promise of everlasting life.

01:39.504 --> 01:43.104
The chamber could only be opened
with a single key...

01:43.204 --> 01:45.505
which, if ever found...

01:46.005 --> 01:51.205
would guide its bearer back
to the fountainhead of immortality.

01:53.006 --> 01:57.606
However, the key would drive
all who touched it insane.

01:59.407 --> 02:04.007
When the Arakacians were finally defeated,
the chamber was locked...

02:04.107 --> 02:08.108
and the key, cast out deep into space.

02:09.108 --> 02:11.608
It has never been found...

02:12.309 --> 02:14.509
until now.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.122
Come on!

03:44.723 --> 03:47.123
Give it up, why don't ya!

03:48.923 --> 03:51.424
Damn! Not again!

03:55.024 --> 03:57.825
I can't wait to get
those new matter munchers.

03:58.525 --> 04:01.425
I've had just about enough
of these cheap heads.

04:16.226 --> 04:19.228
Tyler, major find here!

04:19.528 --> 04:20.628
What is it?

04:24.629 --> 04:26.029
I don't know.

04:42.531 --> 04:45.132
Careful, it could be a Class 4 biohazard.

04:46.132 --> 04:47.932
What is that thing?

04:50.533 --> 04:52.033
What's it doing?

05:14.936 --> 05:17.437
It's... weird.

05:26.438 --> 05:27.638
Tyler!

05:30.939 --> 05:32.439
What's going on?

05:33.639 --> 05:34.839
Are you okay?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.840
Should I call for a containment crew?

05:40.940 --> 05:42.140
Stay back.

05:44.241 --> 05:45.441
No, please!

06:15.646 --> 06:17.600
The guardian has revealed himself!

06:17.701 --> 06:19.546
The key has been found!

06:20.346 --> 06:21.546
Odin, tell us...

06:21.647 --> 06:24.447
Is the day of the great darkness at hand?

06:24.647 --> 06:30.148
Yes. It is written in the Old Books.
The coming back time has begun.

06:32.948 --> 06:35.048
Evil will descend upon us!

06:35.348 --> 06:37.649
We must prepare to defend the chamber!

06:59.252 --> 07:00.852
Sanders, sector 3!

07:01.152 --> 07:04.053
We're still waiting for their
preliminary core samples, Captain.

07:04.153 --> 07:06.653
What? How long
have they been down there?

07:06.853 --> 07:08.173
Over 12 hours.

07:08.274 --> 07:10.154
They must be going nuts.

07:12.054 --> 07:13.079
Weird.

07:13.180 --> 07:15.261
System checks out, but no response.

07:15.362 --> 07:16.455
Deadsville.

07:16.555 --> 07:19.555
Send someone down there.
I want to know what's going on.

07:20.755 --> 07:23.256
I need a big ship to get somewhere.

07:23.356 --> 07:25.356
What the hell do you think you're doing?

07:25.456 --> 07:27.156
Security. To the bridge!

07:36.858 --> 07:38.658
Any other stupid questions?

07:42.359 --> 07:46.359
You, fat boy.
Name and duties.

07:47.059 --> 07:50.260
- Lambert, sir. Navigation's Officer.
- Drive.

07:52.460 --> 07:53.860
Germain St. Germain.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.061
When I want your name, shit brain,
I'll ask for it.

07:57.261 --> 07:58.861
Take over engineering.

07:59.261 --> 08:02.162
Plot a course for BR-549, sector 7.

08:03.062 --> 08:05.062
And somebody better
get rid of this garbage.

08:10.463 --> 08:11.663
By the way...

08:12.963 --> 08:15.564
you have 20 seconds
to get us out of here.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
Hi.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.300
What are you still doing here?

12:15.600 --> 12:18.100
I know. I'm going to be late for school.

12:18.401 --> 12:19.601
Where's Dad?

12:19.701 --> 12:22.801
He's at the council meeting.
I thought you were supposed to go.

12:22.901 --> 12:24.001
Oh, shit!

12:39.404 --> 12:42.404
Do you believe
any of that immortality crap?

12:42.504 --> 12:45.205
I mean, think about it.
A stupid key?

12:46.205 --> 12:48.205
Call him a liar, and see what happens.

12:48.305 --> 12:50.805
Listen, this guy's getting weirder
by the day.

12:50.905 --> 12:52.706
Imagine in 10 years?

12:52.807 --> 12:54.206
Hell, 100.

12:55.306 --> 12:56.706
You've got a point.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.744
I am getting sick of it.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.107
Going all over the bloody place.

13:01.307 --> 13:03.507
Looking for a stupid compound!

13:06.608 --> 13:09.808
- What have you got?
- A FAKK 2 planet, sir.

13:10.808 --> 13:13.609
Death to all carbon based life forms.

13:15.009 --> 13:18.410
Federation Assigned Kitogenic Killzone
to the second level.

13:18.510 --> 13:21.210
Which means... it's a dead planet.

13:21.410 --> 13:22.710
Scan it anyway.

13:24.911 --> 13:26.411
I don't get it.

13:27.311 --> 13:29.011
There's life out there.

13:29.111 --> 13:32.112
The FAKK 2 must have been
from an old registry.

13:32.412 --> 13:36.112
I want a bio-scan
for compound H2O-471.

13:43.914 --> 13:46.614
There are small traces in their systems.

13:48.114 --> 13:50.615
Yeah. Immortality all over the place.

13:51.415 --> 13:52.515
You!

13:53.015 --> 13:55.415
Just remember you're not immortal yet!

13:56.915 --> 13:58.816
What's this place called?

14:02.016 --> 14:03.116
Eden, sir.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.617
Welcome to paradise.

14:15.018 --> 14:18.519
And our irrigation program
is already showing promise.

14:19.019 --> 14:22.619
Agro-production is up five percent
in the last six months.

14:22.919 --> 14:25.420
Phase two of our expansion project...

14:25.520 --> 14:29.920
the development of the Noma Valley,
will begin in three weeks as scheduled.

14:30.321 --> 14:32.422
Things look good, ladies and gentlemen.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.331
Our future is bright.

14:49.023 --> 14:51.583
Help Kerrie.
I'll get our air defences up!

14:51.684 --> 14:53.824
Be careful! I'll see you up there!

14:57.725 --> 14:59.325
Quickly. This way!

15:34.530 --> 15:35.730
Kerrie!

17:46.850 --> 17:47.951
Julie.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.051
Father!

18:33.157 --> 18:36.258
Looks like the boys
got a little trigger-happy.

18:36.958 --> 18:40.358
When making an omelette,
one breaks a few eggs.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.760
Here, let me help you.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.761
They attacked.

18:56.561 --> 19:00.261
- You okay?
- We never had a chance.

19:01.362 --> 19:03.285
Hey, look at this!

19:03.386 --> 19:05.462
A live one!

19:06.162 --> 19:07.463
Leave her alone!

19:14.564 --> 19:17.564
Get off of me! Let me go!

19:24.965 --> 19:27.466
Feisty and sexy.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.166
Careful boys, this one's a keeper.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.067
- Pack 'em up!
- Yes, sir!

19:34.467 --> 19:37.067
Splitsville, boys! We're moving out!

19:47.569 --> 19:48.869
Wait for me!

19:49.369 --> 19:52.369
- Lover-boy, you're on your own.
- What?

19:52.369 --> 19:54.870
You can't just leave me here like this!

19:56.170 --> 19:57.770
Wait a minute, man...

20:03.771 --> 20:07.172
Like the sign says, a dead planet.

20:37.976 --> 20:40.877
This won't hurt. It's just a DNA test.

20:40.977 --> 20:43.777
The good stuff comes later.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.378
Start with the others, Doc...

20:48.678 --> 20:52.579
- This one's special.
- But of course.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.979
What I need is in your system.

20:57.479 --> 20:59.180
Not enough to make you immortal...

20:59.280 --> 21:02.355
but it probably keeps you people
beautiful and healthy.

21:03.056 --> 21:04.580
Especially you.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.181
I'll save you for last.

21:07.381 --> 21:10.581
And if you're lucky, my dear,
and play your cards right...

21:10.681 --> 21:13.882
we'll spend a lot of
quality time together.

21:22.383 --> 21:25.884
Perfect. I knew
you wouldn't disappoint me.

21:28.784 --> 21:29.984
Clean her up!

21:30.484 --> 21:33.085
And I don't have to remind your kind...

21:33.785 --> 21:35.185
she's mine.

22:44.900 --> 22:45.900
Why?

23:22.701 --> 23:24.702
Man, I should have been a cook!

23:26.002 --> 23:28.002
Try this for an appetiser!

23:28.102 --> 23:31.503
- I didn't do anything! I swear!
- You're one of them!

23:31.603 --> 23:33.655
No! I mean, I was,
but I ran away!

23:33.756 --> 23:35.003
I didn't kill anybody!

23:35.103 --> 23:36.403
Who did this?

23:36.503 --> 23:39.104
He took over our ship
and forced us to come here!

23:39.204 --> 23:41.204
- Who?
- His name's Tyler!

23:41.304 --> 23:42.504
Why did he attack?

23:42.604 --> 23:45.505
He's nuts!
He thinks he's going to live forever!

23:45.605 --> 23:47.105
Where did he go?

23:47.506 --> 23:49.705
You've got one second.

23:50.205 --> 23:51.206
One....

23:52.606 --> 23:54.506
Wait! I'll take you to him!

23:54.606 --> 23:56.906
- Where?
- Do we have a deal?

23:59.707 --> 24:02.210
How long to fix this Spacehawk?

24:02.311 --> 24:04.408
Two hours, max!
I'm almost there.

24:07.208 --> 24:11.009
You dropped your wrench.
Aren't you going to pick it up?

24:11.909 --> 24:12.909
Yeah.

24:18.010 --> 24:19.510
What did I do?

24:37.313 --> 24:39.313
I am a genius.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.914
Doc, this'd better work.

24:54.915 --> 24:57.416
I like the hint of lemon.

24:58.116 --> 24:59.716
I'm so glad.

25:01.616 --> 25:02.816
Yes!

25:12.618 --> 25:14.118
So, where are we going?

25:15.918 --> 25:18.519
He said he needed
to get to a jump port.

25:18.719 --> 25:21.519
Computer, set co-ordinates
for the closest spaceport...

25:21.619 --> 25:23.420
that can handle a class C vessel.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.123
Searching. Searching.
Confirmed.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.420
Neo Calcutta. Course set.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.221
ETA 93.7 hours.

25:45.823 --> 25:47.323
So, what's your name?

25:47.624 --> 25:48.822
Listen,

25:48.923 --> 25:52.124
don't talk, don't touch,
don't even breathe...

25:52.224 --> 25:56.025
- or I kill you. Got it?
- I got it.

26:51.033 --> 26:53.433
Request incoming docking co-ordinates.

26:53.933 --> 26:55.934
Please continue holding pattern.

26:56.334 --> 27:02.235
Lock in approach at A.N.U.S-6370.

27:03.135 --> 27:06.335
- Confirmed.
- State the purpose of your visit.

27:06.535 --> 27:08.936
- Revenge.
- Processing.

27:09.536 --> 27:11.004
Invalid entry.

27:11.105 --> 27:12.436
Resubmit.

27:13.336 --> 27:15.537
- Family business.
- Confirmed.

27:16.037 --> 27:17.737
Forty-eight hour access.

27:18.237 --> 27:23.438
Visa file number U.R.F.U.K.D-881.

27:24.038 --> 27:26.038
Please submit identity.

27:29.839 --> 27:31.039
FAKK 2.

27:31.139 --> 27:33.639
Confirmed. Cleared for docking.

28:07.544 --> 28:09.044
All right!

28:10.145 --> 28:11.945
You like this place?

28:12.545 --> 28:14.546
Looks like a lot of your type.

28:14.747 --> 28:16.045
Well, I mean...

28:16.146 --> 28:19.846
After four days stuck in a Spacehawk,
getting the cold shoulder...

28:19.946 --> 28:22.947
it's not so bad.
We could have a lot of fun here.

28:23.047 --> 28:25.147
What are you, socially deprived?

28:25.247 --> 28:28.848
I'm not socially deprived.
Well, maybe a little.

28:29.049 --> 28:30.247
But, I mean...

28:30.348 --> 28:34.849
"Sit down! What are you looking at?
You snore!

28:35.349 --> 28:38.149
"Get outta my face!
Shut the fuck up!"

28:39.149 --> 28:41.750
This is heaven compared
to where I come from.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.050
Shut the fuck up.

28:51.351 --> 28:54.427
Are you sure this guy Tyler
is looking for a jump port?

28:55.228 --> 28:56.452
And to where?

29:01.253 --> 29:04.253
We're talking high-grade,
silicone-rubber flesh here.

29:04.353 --> 29:07.800
And a PVC skeleton with
plastic ball and socket joints

29:07.901 --> 29:09.254
for optimum movement.

29:09.554 --> 29:12.954
You can customise her
with a choice of seven synthetic hair dyes.

29:13.054 --> 29:17.055
And optional entry ports
with four speeds of suction!

29:18.655 --> 29:20.155
Loveable, isn't she?

29:20.255 --> 29:21.655
Well...

29:21.756 --> 29:23.256
Check this out.

29:23.356 --> 29:27.257
She's loaded with the latest micro-sensor
orgasmatronic technology...

29:27.457 --> 29:29.557
and an expandable vocabulary...

29:29.657 --> 29:33.057
of over 200 dirty words.

29:33.157 --> 29:36.158
Test results indicate
she's better than the real thing.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.658
Go on, Venus.
Show the gentleman what you got.

29:43.159 --> 29:46.059
Please select your sexual preference.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.860
Vaginal. Anal. Oral. Other.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.660
Only 2,000.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.061
I don't know, 2,000....

29:56.161 --> 29:59.661
Unless, of course,
you'd prefer the Fellation Blowfish.

30:00.562 --> 30:05.462
Sick, twisted, low-life,
scum sucking pig!

30:05.562 --> 30:07.763
At least I'll have someone to talk to.

30:07.863 --> 30:09.062
Oh, no!

30:09.163 --> 30:10.163
What?

30:10.363 --> 30:13.164
That's him. The tall one.

30:15.464 --> 30:18.864
- Let's go.
- I'll... wait here.

30:18.964 --> 30:21.665
But he'll see me.
You don't know what he's like.

30:21.765 --> 30:24.265
Yeah, right. Chicken shit.

30:38.705 --> 30:39.705
Baby!

31:16.773 --> 31:18.373
God, this is fun!

31:24.373 --> 31:25.373
Free?

31:40.277 --> 31:42.177
Nobody touches these...

31:44.477 --> 31:45.578
but me!

31:46.978 --> 31:48.278
Bar towel!

32:01.579 --> 32:03.779
Yes! Oh, god!

32:04.280 --> 32:07.481
Hello? Captain Tyler,
Metal Mammoth Mining.

32:07.581 --> 32:09.381
We need some drinks!

32:13.982 --> 32:17.182
We should make it fast.
We don't want to miss the jump.

32:17.982 --> 32:19.583
- Screw the jump!
- But...

32:19.783 --> 32:21.783
I've got all the time in the world!

32:22.083 --> 32:24.783
Besides, something just came up.

32:24.983 --> 32:26.783
But, er...

32:27.384 --> 32:30.384
You just found the man of your dreams.

33:36.794 --> 33:40.795
When you kill someone, darling,
make sure he's dead.

33:41.295 --> 33:42.695
What the hell?

34:31.601 --> 34:32.802
Well...

34:32.902 --> 34:34.803
Looks like happy hour is over.

34:35.603 --> 34:39.404
- Who's gonna pay for all of this?
- This ought to take care of it.

34:39.504 --> 34:41.904
Here. Keep the change.

34:42.304 --> 34:44.405
What? Holy shit!

34:44.905 --> 34:46.105
Grenades!

35:05.808 --> 35:07.008
Julie?

35:08.808 --> 35:10.008
Julie?

35:10.609 --> 35:11.808
Julie?

35:11.909 --> 35:13.309
Are you all right?

35:16.510 --> 35:17.685
He died!

35:17.786 --> 35:20.110
And then he was alive again!

35:20.510 --> 35:21.810
Now you know.

35:23.111 --> 35:24.395
I don't know dick!

35:24.496 --> 35:25.611
How does he do it?

35:25.711 --> 35:27.711
He's got this weird potion!

35:27.811 --> 35:30.412
And a key that's leading him
to the Chamber of lmmortality.

35:30.512 --> 35:32.712
Why didn't you tell me that before?

35:32.812 --> 35:35.912
"Sit down. Get outta my face!
Shut the fuck up!"

35:37.812 --> 35:39.212
Okay, okay!

35:39.313 --> 35:43.114
So if I take away his potion,
he'll stay dead, right?

35:43.214 --> 35:46.414
If... you can get close enough.

35:49.214 --> 35:50.915
That's him, isn't it?

35:51.015 --> 35:53.015
Son of a bitch, he's getting away!

35:53.815 --> 35:56.716
What more could the universe want
in a tyrant?

35:57.616 --> 36:00.816
Perfect body, perfect mind.

36:02.016 --> 36:05.117
- Irresistible charm.
- Perfect psycho!

36:06.117 --> 36:07.242
Psycho?

36:07.843 --> 36:09.418
Time to come out and play.

36:09.518 --> 36:11.518
Don't even think about it!

36:15.118 --> 36:18.319
The hyperspace jump.
There's always something.

36:19.619 --> 36:22.120
I'll make it up to you later, sweetheart.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.520
Let me out of here, you bastard!

36:34.222 --> 36:36.722
Oh yeah, this is fun!
Oh yeah, this is good!

36:39.722 --> 36:41.722
Oh yeah,
I'm having a good time!

36:43.223 --> 36:44.833
Cortez to Jump Control.

36:44.934 --> 36:46.723
Set lock-in for Uroboris.

36:46.823 --> 36:48.424
No pre-set lock-in.

36:48.525 --> 36:50.124
Set co-ordinates.

36:50.324 --> 36:54.124
Quadrant 9, sector 4013,
in the Terackian system.

36:54.424 --> 36:56.225
Scanning location.

36:57.025 --> 37:00.025
Warning. No return jump-port.

37:00.225 --> 37:02.226
Please confirm lock-in.

37:02.926 --> 37:03.926
Confirmed.

37:04.026 --> 37:07.026
But, it'll take us forever
to get back!

37:07.926 --> 37:10.327
That won't be a problem,
once we get there.

37:12.726 --> 37:13.726
Look,

37:13.827 --> 37:16.028
we'll never make it!
This thing's a death trap!

37:17.828 --> 37:21.328
- It's gotten us this far.
- This far is nowhere.

37:21.629 --> 37:23.829
Spacehawk in hyperspace equals death!

37:24.129 --> 37:25.529
Stow the bag.

37:29.429 --> 37:30.829
Oh, no! Oh, no!

37:31.829 --> 37:33.029
Jesus!

37:50.033 --> 37:51.088
Are you nuts?

37:51.189 --> 37:53.733
I'm not going to lose him now.

38:22.338 --> 38:25.438
You can't just piggyback their jump!

38:32.239 --> 38:34.906
A tractor beam! Are you insane?

38:35.007 --> 38:36.140
We're going to rip to...

39:01.244 --> 39:02.579
What the hell is that?

39:02.980 --> 39:04.444
We've got company.

39:04.644 --> 39:07.445
Excuse me, "company"?
What do you mean "company"?

39:07.645 --> 39:08.645
See that blip?

39:08.746 --> 39:10.845
It's like somebody hitched onto our jump.

39:10.945 --> 39:12.870
That could change our trajectory.

39:12.971 --> 39:15.546
I want them dead! Now!
Take 'em down!

39:15.746 --> 39:18.846
But I've never heard of anyone
firing on a ship in hyperspace.

39:18.946 --> 39:20.647
Do you have a better idea?

39:20.808 --> 39:21.957
Do it! Now!

39:22.147 --> 39:23.947
Man, that's suicide.

39:34.149 --> 39:35.326
We lost them all.

39:35.427 --> 39:37.749
- They're toast.
- Send the bomber.

39:37.850 --> 39:38.948
But...

39:39.049 --> 39:42.250
One more word, and I'll send you.

39:48.150 --> 39:49.950
Shit!

39:50.251 --> 39:52.306
We're hit! I knew it!

39:52.407 --> 39:53.952
I knew it!

39:54.152 --> 39:55.952
This is all your fault!

40:02.153 --> 40:03.753
Do something!

40:17.455 --> 40:19.155
The tunnel's breaking up!

40:19.656 --> 40:21.956
We're not going to make it!

40:32.258 --> 40:35.558
Oh, yes! Do it! Do it!

41:06.263 --> 41:09.063
I sense the key is here.

41:10.463 --> 41:14.764
For the moment, it is best
if Zeek and I assess the threat alone.

42:43.077 --> 42:44.477
My ampoules.

42:45.277 --> 42:47.077
No!

42:47.977 --> 42:48.977
No!

42:51.178 --> 42:53.779
I'm afraid it's down to you.

42:54.679 --> 42:56.879
No. Please.

43:05.181 --> 43:07.181
Lambert, damage report.

43:08.781 --> 43:11.081
Lambert, I want a damage report!

43:13.431 --> 43:14.431
Lambert?

43:22.383 --> 43:24.183
Don't worry, I'm fine.

43:24.584 --> 43:26.984
Yeah? Like I give a shit!

43:27.184 --> 43:30.284
What's the status
on the double D-40s ammunitions?

43:30.785 --> 43:32.285
We found a wheel.

43:32.485 --> 43:33.685
Personnel?

43:34.086 --> 43:35.184
Seventy...

43:35.385 --> 43:37.586
Seventy-eight percent dead or missing.

43:37.786 --> 43:38.986
Life-scan?

43:41.386 --> 43:42.686
There's a town.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.787
Looks like it's about
10 or 12 miles north of here.

43:45.987 --> 43:47.287
Flight status?

43:47.987 --> 43:49.687
You've got to be kidding.

43:49.887 --> 43:52.388
Gather the weapons,
what's left of my men...

43:52.488 --> 43:54.788
shoot the injured. We're moving on.

44:13.092 --> 44:14.292
Germaine?

44:24.293 --> 44:26.493
Was it good for you?

44:29.793 --> 44:31.694
I'll start you off like this.

44:31.794 --> 44:34.356
The next step,
in three or four days,

44:34.457 --> 44:36.094
depending on your production...

44:36.194 --> 44:38.995
will be the body tank.

44:40.995 --> 44:42.495
You're sick!

44:43.396 --> 44:45.896
I'm a sick genius.

45:38.504 --> 45:40.304
I can't breathe.

45:41.104 --> 45:43.105
Get off my face!

45:45.905 --> 45:47.505
What are you?

45:47.705 --> 45:50.106
I'm Zeek, what are you?

45:54.306 --> 45:56.107
You're so soft.

45:56.807 --> 45:58.807
I'm harder than you think,
little stone man.

45:58.907 --> 46:02.808
Please, you must not touch
my master Odin's property.

46:02.908 --> 46:06.108
He's left me with the responsibility
to guard it.

46:06.208 --> 46:08.826
Relax, your thing is safe with me.

46:08.927 --> 46:10.409
Where is your master?

46:10.609 --> 46:12.109
I am Odin.

46:12.209 --> 46:16.510
Please excuse my little friend,
he takes his duties very seriously.

46:16.810 --> 46:20.010
- What are you called?
- FAKK Julie.

46:21.610 --> 46:25.811
Julie, soft. Very soft.

46:26.511 --> 46:28.711
You're not from our world, are you?

46:28.912 --> 46:31.212
Hardly. What is this place?

46:31.712 --> 46:35.713
Uroboris. Some call it home.
Others call it hell.

46:36.113 --> 46:38.613
My master says you come from the sky.

46:38.713 --> 46:41.413
Do you have it? Do you have the key?

46:41.814 --> 46:43.814
I don't know anything about a key.

46:43.914 --> 46:46.714
I crashed here trying to kill a madman,
who won't stay dead.

46:46.814 --> 46:48.815
I did see two fireballs.

46:49.215 --> 46:52.915
The other was headed in the direction
of a city called Shantaar.

46:53.915 --> 46:55.416
It's not far from here.

46:55.517 --> 46:56.916
We'll take you there.

46:57.016 --> 46:58.016
Yeah!

46:58.116 --> 47:00.216
So please, come with us.

47:01.116 --> 47:04.117
Tell me more about this madman.

47:04.817 --> 47:08.718
Bastard named Tyler,
killed everyone I ever cared about.

47:08.918 --> 47:12.048
Our legends say that
whoever carries the key,

47:12.149 --> 47:14.018
becomes insane.

47:14.719 --> 47:16.719
That's him all right.

47:18.519 --> 47:21.519
I'm sorry. I sense your sadness.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.420
It's hard to be the last of your people.

48:32.430 --> 48:34.072
Not much of an army.

48:34.373 --> 48:35.731
But it's a start.

48:36.031 --> 48:40.031
Look. The ugliest one
seems to be sitting in my chair.

49:06.535 --> 49:08.536
Hey, you, ugly!

49:09.636 --> 49:12.736
Your mother is a Hectarian
whore's handbag!

49:47.942 --> 49:49.442
Molten lava?

49:49.543 --> 49:51.543
We have to cross this?

49:51.742 --> 49:55.043
Yes, Shantaar lies on the other side.

49:56.843 --> 50:00.344
- I hate this place.
- How are we going to cross?

50:03.144 --> 50:08.245
I am Chartog, guardian of the Red River.

50:08.645 --> 50:10.345
I know the way across...

50:11.045 --> 50:13.646
and... and I will tell you.

50:15.046 --> 50:16.746
You just have to...

50:18.346 --> 50:19.947
kiss me.

50:20.547 --> 50:21.647
No way.

50:22.847 --> 50:25.647
What's the matter, my precious?

50:27.148 --> 50:30.348
Don't you find me attractive?

50:32.348 --> 50:34.849
If this is what it takes to kill Tyler....

50:36.549 --> 50:38.301
That's a good girl.

50:38.502 --> 50:40.450
Help your friends.

50:40.750 --> 50:43.150
It will be over soon.

50:43.950 --> 50:46.451
Who will I have to kiss to get back?

50:57.652 --> 50:59.253
What are you doing?

51:00.453 --> 51:02.253
We're waiting for you.

51:03.653 --> 51:05.131
Son of a bitch!

51:05.432 --> 51:06.954
Kiss this!

51:11.354 --> 51:14.355
Your people have strange customs.

51:16.255 --> 51:17.855
Tell me about it.

51:42.859 --> 51:46.460
Mortality sucks, immortality sucks.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.760
Everything sucks.

51:51.861 --> 51:53.061
Oh, shit.

51:55.361 --> 51:57.361
This really sucks.

52:32.567 --> 52:34.967
Is he the one you search for?

52:36.067 --> 52:37.567
Oh, yeah.

52:44.869 --> 52:47.069
Yeah! Come on, Tyler!

52:56.969 --> 52:59.769
Yes! Yes!

53:00.870 --> 53:05.072
- Oh shit!
- I'm your new leader! Me!

53:12.373 --> 53:14.373
Now we're up the creek.

53:26.475 --> 53:28.375
When you kill someone...

53:30.876 --> 53:32.776
make sure they're dead!

53:40.477 --> 53:41.677
Yo, baby.

53:53.379 --> 53:55.998
I am Tyler!

53:56.299 --> 53:58.680
Your new lord!

54:00.681 --> 54:01.681
Yeah!

54:05.181 --> 54:07.435
Oh yes!

54:08.436 --> 54:09.481
Yes!

54:10.682 --> 54:14.082
Blind adulation makes me so horny.

54:15.182 --> 54:16.682
Bring me a wench!

54:24.384 --> 54:27.813
Master, he's the one
with the key, isn't he?

54:27.914 --> 54:28.984
Yes.

54:29.584 --> 54:32.585
And he's far too powerful
for us to deal with alone.

54:32.685 --> 54:34.085
Leave that to me.

54:34.285 --> 54:36.719
Julie, you are too impulsive.

54:36.820 --> 54:39.086
Please, think about this.

54:39.286 --> 54:41.886
- Think about what?
- The key.

54:42.886 --> 54:46.187
- You don't understand.
- You worry about the key.

54:46.487 --> 54:48.287
Tyler's mine.

54:51.188 --> 54:54.988
She is letting her thirst for revenge
rule her mind.

55:22.392 --> 55:23.592
Yes.

55:24.593 --> 55:27.093
A little retro, but hey....

55:37.495 --> 55:39.095
Where'd they find you?

55:40.495 --> 55:42.786
I hear you're very special.

55:42.987 --> 55:45.396
I've come a long way to meet you.

55:49.497 --> 55:51.917
You're not a robot, are you?

55:52.018 --> 55:54.797
Why don't you find out for yourself?

55:54.897 --> 55:58.098
God, I could say I've died
and gone to heaven, but...

55:58.898 --> 56:00.598
that wouldn't be true.

56:01.098 --> 56:04.899
Which part, the dying or the heaven?

56:07.999 --> 56:09.000
You.

56:14.200 --> 56:17.601
I know I'm irresistible, but
what do you want?

56:17.901 --> 56:19.501
I want you...

56:20.501 --> 56:22.502
and what you have.

56:22.702 --> 56:25.602
There's a price to pay for immortality...

56:25.702 --> 56:28.502
and the universe is going
to pick up the tab.

56:29.803 --> 56:31.403
How original.

56:31.903 --> 56:34.203
Every king must have a queen.

56:35.604 --> 56:37.204
Do you want me?

56:38.204 --> 56:39.904
Take a wild guess.

56:44.805 --> 56:46.005
Forever?

56:46.905 --> 56:48.105
Shut up.

56:59.307 --> 57:00.807
Not this time!

57:03.208 --> 57:04.308
Bitch!

57:04.608 --> 57:06.508
Time to die!

57:12.309 --> 57:13.309
Die!

57:19.310 --> 57:20.710
What are you doing?

57:22.011 --> 57:23.857
- Stop!
- I can't!

57:23.958 --> 57:26.111
The master told me!

57:28.012 --> 57:29.128
You stupid little...

57:29.229 --> 57:30.712
You stupid rock!

57:41.214 --> 57:44.414
What does it take
to get laid around here?

57:45.264 --> 57:46.264
I had him!

57:46.365 --> 57:48.915
Ten more seconds, and he was dead!

57:49.515 --> 57:51.515
We thought you were in trouble.

57:51.915 --> 57:54.816
Julie, it's too late.

57:55.416 --> 57:57.916
It's not just about you and Tyler.

57:58.716 --> 58:02.517
What Tyler seeks lies
within the walls of the Holylands.

58:03.617 --> 58:04.949
He will come...

58:05.550 --> 58:07.918
...and we will all be judged.

58:09.518 --> 58:12.518
What do you mean,
you can't find them?

58:13.118 --> 58:17.719
How do you lose a 6-foot bitch
with a talking rock?

58:19.519 --> 58:21.020
How do you do that?

58:21.220 --> 58:24.720
- We looked everywhere.
- You idiots!

58:25.020 --> 58:26.420
Gather the troops!

58:26.921 --> 58:29.421
So, this is it?

58:31.021 --> 58:35.022
I sure could use a drink
and a little social give and take.

58:36.021 --> 58:37.026
Yeah.

58:37.027 --> 58:39.552
Well, there goes that idea.

58:54.674 --> 58:55.674
Zeek...

58:55.925 --> 58:57.831
Can we stop for a moment?

58:58.352 --> 59:00.726
I'm not as young as I once was.

59:00.926 --> 59:02.926
I'll see what lies beyond.

59:05.526 --> 59:06.726
Eden...

59:07.027 --> 59:08.827
Eden was beautiful.

59:09.527 --> 59:11.427
Then he destroyed it.

59:11.827 --> 59:14.428
Master, come see!

59:39.932 --> 59:43.132
It's time for the next phase.

59:44.631 --> 59:45.631
Don't.

59:45.932 --> 59:47.033
Please.

59:47.233 --> 59:50.633
In five minutes,
you will lose all senses.

59:53.534 --> 59:56.534
It will seem like a very peaceful dying.

59:57.234 --> 59:58.234
What?

59:58.335 --> 01:00:00.135
We have company.

01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:24.141
What have they done?

01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:36.241
- Kerrie!
- Julie!

01:00:37.741 --> 01:00:39.941
I don't appreciate being disturbed.

01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:51.542
Do you like this?

01:01:00.644 --> 01:01:02.844
You shouldn't have done that.

01:01:19.347 --> 01:01:22.547
Now, I'm really upset!

01:01:26.148 --> 01:01:27.897
I am worried, Master.

01:01:28.098 --> 01:01:30.748
The soft one has been inside too long.

01:01:32.449 --> 01:01:34.949
Here, kitty, kity, kitty.

01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:38.049
I know where you are.

01:01:38.149 --> 01:01:40.850
I can smell you.

01:01:47.651 --> 01:01:48.851
Help me!

01:01:54.052 --> 01:01:57.552
- Kerrie, what about the others?
- They're all dead.

01:01:58.453 --> 01:01:59.453
Come on.

01:01:59.553 --> 01:02:00.753
Hang on to me.

01:02:06.454 --> 01:02:07.654
It's okay.

01:02:09.454 --> 01:02:10.654
Nearly there.

01:02:16.455 --> 01:02:17.655
Hurry, run!

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.060
Isn't that where we crashed?

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.960
My ampoules!

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760
No!

01:02:59.462 --> 01:03:02.162
I've had it up to here
with that bitch!

01:03:02.662 --> 01:03:05.364
When I find her,
I'll make her immortal...

01:03:05.465 --> 01:03:07.773
so I can screw her and kill her...

01:03:07.863 --> 01:03:10.108
every hour of every day

01:03:10.209 --> 01:03:12.064
for all eternity!

01:03:12.164 --> 01:03:14.364
We march on the Holyland now!

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.266
Where the key goes, horror follows.

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:28.366
All in the sacred name of immortality.

01:03:29.166 --> 01:03:30.366
Why us?

01:03:30.466 --> 01:03:33.767
Do your ancient books not teach you
about the Arakacians?

01:03:33.867 --> 01:03:35.567
We have no ancient books.

01:03:35.867 --> 01:03:38.668
They were destroyed
so our people could live in peace...

01:03:38.768 --> 01:03:40.968
without the memory of past evil.

01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:46.169
To forget history is
to allow evil to rise again, Julie.

01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:48.869
More sinister and ruthless than ever.

01:03:48.969 --> 01:03:52.470
- Is Tyler an Arakacian?
- He is not.

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:54.103
Many centuries ago,

01:03:54.204 --> 01:03:56.970
the Arakacians discovered
an ancient tear...

01:03:57.071 --> 01:03:58.792
in the fabric of the universe,

01:03:58.893 --> 01:04:00.571
from which flowed a liquid...

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:02.871
capable of bestowing immortality.

01:04:03.471 --> 01:04:05.671
They enslaved my ancestors...

01:04:05.872 --> 01:04:07.872
and forced them to build a chamber...

01:04:07.972 --> 01:04:10.290
in the Holylands to contain this...

01:04:10.391 --> 01:04:12.073
unnatural power.

01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:15.773
And so it was that the Arakacians
ruled in infamy...

01:04:15.873 --> 01:04:18.739
until my people were able
to lock the chamber,

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.344
and cast the key deep into space.

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:24.282
Without their life-giving waters,

01:04:24.383 --> 01:04:26.675
the Arakacians became mortal...

01:04:26.975 --> 01:04:29.575
and we were finally able to defeat them.

01:04:30.276 --> 01:04:32.276
But now Tyler has the key.

01:04:32.376 --> 01:04:35.776
Yes. The key which holds
the promise of immortality...

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:39.277
but also renders its bearer insane.

01:04:39.477 --> 01:04:41.477
Such is the curse.

01:04:42.377 --> 01:04:45.378
The promise of immortality?
He's already invincible.

01:04:45.478 --> 01:04:47.878
No. He is not.

01:04:49.078 --> 01:04:52.279
The key is guiding him
to the everlasting waters...

01:04:52.379 --> 01:04:54.179
but he has yet to reach them.

01:04:54.279 --> 01:04:56.480
Why did he have to destroy Eden?

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.780
The Arakacians also occupied your colony...

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.981
and stored some of the liquid there
as they ravaged the universe.

01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:06.681
Over time it seeped into the earth.

01:05:06.781 --> 01:05:10.082
Your people absorbed traces of it
into their systems.

01:05:10.382 --> 01:05:12.882
Which Tyler distilled from their bodies!

01:05:13.082 --> 01:05:14.281
Yes.

01:05:14.382 --> 01:05:16.683
Not enough to render him immortal...

01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:19.683
but now he has the strength
to reach the chamber.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:23.584
A whole people destroyed
because of the lust for power of one man.

01:05:23.884 --> 01:05:26.231
It has happened before, Julie.

01:05:26.432 --> 01:05:28.484
It will happen again.

01:05:29.084 --> 01:05:30.585
Not with Tyler.

01:06:25.493 --> 01:06:27.693
Welcome back, Master Odin!

01:06:42.696 --> 01:06:46.496
- Odin, the key? ls it here?
- I'm afraid so.

01:06:47.196 --> 01:06:48.997
As we speak, the carrier...

01:06:49.097 --> 01:06:52.897
and the vile scum of Shantaar
descend upon our city.

01:06:53.797 --> 01:06:56.004
We have done all we can to prepare.

01:06:56.105 --> 01:06:57.998
We will fight to the death.

01:08:42.813 --> 01:08:43.912
You?

01:08:44.514 --> 01:08:46.113
You know each other?

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.515
He tried to save me at the school.

01:08:48.915 --> 01:08:50.415
It was nothing.

01:08:51.715 --> 01:08:53.515
And where did you meet?

01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:55.416
We're sisters.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:57.916
Sisters!

01:08:58.116 --> 01:09:00.465
The elders have been killed!
The elders have been killed!

01:09:00.566 --> 01:09:01.917
There's a traitor among us!

01:09:02.017 --> 01:09:03.417
Warn the others!

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.218
There it is.

01:09:08.218 --> 01:09:12.018
The Chamber of lmmortality,
that holds the everlasting waters.

01:09:51.924 --> 01:09:53.425
The last one.

01:10:21.129 --> 01:10:24.129
Everybody fight! Come on!

01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:56.929
Come on! Come on!

01:11:17.337 --> 01:11:19.338
Okay. This is going to suck!

01:12:08.647 --> 01:12:09.847
Help me!

01:12:18.747 --> 01:12:20.247
No!

01:12:30.048 --> 01:12:31.348
You fool!

01:12:31.749 --> 01:12:34.149
That was my last one!

01:12:34.649 --> 01:12:36.649
No, no! Please!

01:12:58.309 --> 01:12:59.709
Tyler.

01:13:28.257 --> 01:13:31.258
- Thank you, soft one.
- Anytime.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.161
Hey, asshole!

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:53.761
You again!

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:52.970
Did you miss me?

01:15:08.572 --> 01:15:11.073
You always hurt the ones you love.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.573
Like this?

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.625
Hold that pose.

01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:27.075
I'll be right back.

01:15:53.679 --> 01:15:55.210
It's mine.

01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:58.580
It's all mine!

01:16:17.683 --> 01:16:19.171
Bring it on, bitch!

01:16:19.272 --> 01:16:21.783
You're really starting
to piss me off!

01:16:22.083 --> 01:16:25.584
You are not worthy of the Holy Waters!

01:16:26.884 --> 01:16:28.084
Not today.

01:16:53.888 --> 01:16:55.362
Remember this...

01:16:55.563 --> 01:16:57.489
on your way to hell!

01:16:59.889 --> 01:17:01.489
FAKK 2!

01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:07.190
The insanity has to end now.

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:12.890
Now,

01:17:12.991 --> 01:17:14.991
we must destroy the key.

01:17:16.892 --> 01:17:18.692
Perhaps not!

01:17:23.493 --> 01:17:24.493
Why?

01:17:25.693 --> 01:17:27.271
Because...

01:17:27.472 --> 01:17:30.494
I am Arakacian!

01:17:30.694 --> 01:17:34.194
My charade fooled
the insufferable Holylanders!

01:17:34.294 --> 01:17:36.195
And even that little stone idiot!

01:17:36.295 --> 01:17:39.395
What makes you think
a pathetic mortal could stop me?

01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:16.201
You fools!

01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:20.101
You fools!

01:18:39.704 --> 01:18:40.804
Now,

01:18:41.005 --> 01:18:43.605
I must fulfil my destiny.

01:18:57.405 --> 01:18:58.605
No!

01:19:00.107 --> 01:19:01.407
No!

01:19:02.307 --> 01:19:03.411
Zeek!

01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:05.007
Stop!

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.809
- You must!
- Zeek, I command you!

01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:20.390
Good-bye, soft one.

01:19:20.491 --> 01:19:22.511
I'll never forget you.

01:19:24.611 --> 01:19:25.611
No!

01:19:26.112 --> 01:19:28.711
No, stop!

01:19:49.415 --> 01:19:50.615
Julie!

01:19:57.216 --> 01:19:58.416
It's over.

01:20:04.417 --> 01:20:08.318
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no. He survived.

01:20:08.418 --> 01:20:09.618
Are you okay?

01:20:10.018 --> 01:20:12.818
What does it look like, you dickhead?

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.769
Eternity...

01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:25.920
is a long time to spend alone.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.821
What are you talking about?

01:20:29.421 --> 01:20:31.921
Does this mean
we're all going to be immortal?

01:20:33.122 --> 01:20:34.922
'Cause if that's true, you know....

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:37.822
Listen, I'm going to be around
for a long time.

01:20:38.422 --> 01:20:39.823
Who took the key?

01:20:40.423 --> 01:20:42.323
Does this mean we're friends now?

01:20:42.423 --> 01:20:45.623
'Cause I've been putting up
with a lot of your crap, so...

01:20:46.023 --> 01:20:49.024
l think it's payback time.
Come on, you know you love me.

01:20:49.124 --> 01:20:50.524
Come on! Come on!

01:21:09.127 --> 01:21:13.628
And so the key to the chamber
of immortality...

01:21:13.728 --> 01:21:19.028
was once again cast out
into the silent gulfs of space...

01:21:20.429 --> 01:21:23.337
with a new stone protector...

01:21:23.438 --> 01:21:26.430
to guard it against evil.
