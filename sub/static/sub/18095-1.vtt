WEBVTT

01:43.186 --> 01:46.105
If I was going, I'd go as a, um...
A princess!

01:46.272 --> 01:47.981
Uh, yeah.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.777
Judy Baumer's going as a twirler.
But she's so fat.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.072
I'd rather go as Cinderella
or Peter Pan.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.991
Peter Pan's a boy.
Tinkerbell's a girl.

01:58.159 --> 02:02.079
Phillip could go as Peter Pan.
Phillip could go as a bump on a log.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.960
Why can't we just go once?
Because we just can't, okay?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.711
Our personal beliefs lift us
to a higher place.

02:13.383 --> 02:17.010
I'll get it.
You got it last time!

02:17.762 --> 02:19.930
Trick or treat!

02:20.265 --> 02:23.225
I'm sorry, we don't take
no part in Halloween.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.643
Excuse me?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.645
We're Jehovah's Witness.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.316
Hey, Phillip Perry.
Hey, Billy Reeves.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.652
How'd you know it was me?

02:34.362 --> 02:36.238
Come on, go eat your supper.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.117
Come on, kids,
let's go to the next house.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.369
Sorry for the bother.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.056
Evening, Larry. Forget something?
Going to Austin, gotta take some work.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.686
When are we gonna grab a cold one?
Sooner the better!

03:48.728 --> 03:51.438
Hey, daddy!
Yeah?

03:52.565 --> 03:57.611
You sure this goes on up to the vents?
It used to, in the old days.

03:58.154 --> 04:01.823
Because if it don't,
I'm gonna rip your tongue out. Ha, ha.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.451
You punk thief.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.757
Move.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.904
Damn if that old man ain't right.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.489
Here's your trick! Ha-ha-ha!

05:25.950 --> 05:27.743
Bombs away!

05:29.245 --> 05:30.287
Oh, good one!

05:33.458 --> 05:35.459
We really got him.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.443
You and me must be living right,
Butchie-boy.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.531
Let's get something straight.
I don't like you.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.034
As soon as we're on our way...

06:09.202 --> 06:10.786
that's it.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.875
Who said I liked you?

06:44.695 --> 06:46.196
Keep your mouth shut.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.576
God, I'd love to blow your brains out.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.963
Good night, Larry.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.850
Hmm. Good night, Larry.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.114
Come on, wake up.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.294
I like that one.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.089
You sure are picky.
Wrong neighborhood for a Lincoln.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.217
Hey, there's a Buick.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.762
I don't want a Buick. I want a Ford.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.933
Fords leak oil.
Besides, daddy, a car's a car.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.066
Take the Buick.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.571
As soon as we cross
the state line, I'll do just that.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.495
I'm tired of waiting around.
I'm gonna go check down the block...

08:18.581 --> 08:20.749
for a Ford.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.031
Go wake up your sisters.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.973
I take mine fried.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.835
A little on the bland side.

09:47.044 --> 09:51.923
Give me some of that ketchup,
would you? Now. Please?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.844
Aah.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.016
You haven't got a man around here,
now, do you? Hmm?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.145
No! Agh!

10:16.365 --> 10:19.367
Well! We got a fighter here now!

10:20.202 --> 10:21.244
No!

10:22.622 --> 10:26.458
Oh, lookie here. Look, you got
a little man in the house.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.713
No!

10:32.923 --> 10:34.257
No!
Unh!

10:44.143 --> 10:46.019
I'm bleeding! You happy?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.583
What's your name, boy?

11:10.461 --> 11:11.670
Phillip.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.967
Okay, Phillip, reach down
and pick up that pistola for me.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.518
Give it to me.
Shut your mouth!

11:34.151 --> 11:37.445
Pick it up and bring it over to me.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.845
Point it at me.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.018
Point it.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.190
Now say "Stick 'em up."

12:18.571 --> 12:20.572
Stick 'em up.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.951
Perfect.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.503
Put the gun down, old timer.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.508
Put it down. You couldn't hit me
anyway. Probably shoot the boy.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.012
Leave her be.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.139
Mama?
It's all right.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.558
It's all right.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.770
Are you deaf?
Set it on the ground.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.772
Put it down.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.274
Set it down! Down.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.236
Shut up!

13:00.613 --> 13:02.363
I vote we take her.
No.

13:02.656 --> 13:07.452
Then how are we gonna get out of here?
The whole neighborhood's awake!

13:08.746 --> 13:10.997
We'll take the boy.
No. No!

13:11.165 --> 13:14.042
No! Aah! Unh!

13:25.763 --> 13:28.681
Ain't you folks ever heard
of sleeping in?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.478
Yee-ha!

13:51.205 --> 13:53.414
I got it, sir.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.795
Press has been waiting
almost an hour, Red.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.129
I hear you.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.391
Yeah, I hear you. I understand.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.184
I understand.

14:14.854 --> 14:19.691
Yeah. No, I'm here.
I'm just listening. Yeah, okay.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.030
What'd he say?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.199
Who?
The governor, Red.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.869
Well, he reminded me
that it's an election year.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.080
Hi.
Hi.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.542
I, uh, hope you don't drink before noon.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.503
Oh, no, I don't.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.048
The last one we had here,
seemed like she was on a liquid diet.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.595
Last what?
Secretary.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.263
Penny Monroe.

14:50.556 --> 14:54.434
Well, um, I believe you have me confused.
See, I'm from Huntsville.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.061
I was assigned by the governor.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.772
Adler, what is this?

14:59.982 --> 15:05.403
It rings a bell. I think they sent
something over about her this morning.

15:05.613 --> 15:09.073
Who did?
The governor, Red.

15:09.783 --> 15:14.495
I'm Sally Gerber, criminologist
with the state prison system.

15:14.705 --> 15:19.083
Tom Adler, Texas Rangers.
Hi.

15:20.461 --> 15:25.089
Well, uh, it's a relatively new procedure.
I was assigned by the governor to work...

15:25.299 --> 15:29.719
"Work with state law officials
in all affairs of penal matters...

15:29.929 --> 15:33.181
coinciding with the state police."
This doesn't say anything...

15:33.390 --> 15:36.601
It includes parole, work-release programs,
as well as penal escape situations.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.188
We'll be right there, Marge.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.317
They're getting antsy, Red.
You scheduled it.

15:46.487 --> 15:50.448
Uh, the idea is that an understanding
of the behavioral case history...

15:50.616 --> 15:55.954
should, in parole situations,
help the subject to avoid habitual traps.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.289
And in penal escape situations...

15:58.457 --> 16:03.127
could conversely identify those selfsame
traps as an aid to apprehension.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.967
Let me tell you something, Miss Gerber...
Sally is fine.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.010
Let me tell you something, Sally...

16:11.220 --> 16:15.014
this is not a penal escape.
This happens to be a manhunt.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.685
And no talking around in circles
is gonna fix all that.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.064
And what will?
Us having a nose like a blue tick...

16:23.273 --> 16:27.360
that's a medulla with an antenna,
and a lot of coffee.

16:46.296 --> 16:50.383
We got a handful of caps,
and you're shooting water tanks.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.012
He's a smart guy, huh, Phillip?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.815
Goddamn!

17:09.028 --> 17:10.153
Ow!

17:12.281 --> 17:16.034
Okay, boys, that's enough!
The chief's got work to do!

17:16.201 --> 17:18.327
Did the kid say anything?

17:18.494 --> 17:20.788
Good morning, Red.
Good morning.

17:20.955 --> 17:23.833
So, what do you think?
Looks good. Looks good.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.085
We're very proud of this baby.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.839
Governor ordered it so dignitaries
could ride in the parade in Dallas.

17:30.049 --> 17:34.260
You know President Kennedy's coming?
Yeah, so I heard.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.057
Latest technology.
Got an oversized engine...

17:39.266 --> 17:42.560
full kitchen, sleeping quarters.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.812
Got room for gun racks.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.941
Stove, fridge, even got a hotline phone
straight to the governor's office.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.194
Fine piece of machinery.
What's more...

17:51.361 --> 17:54.405
soon as it comes back from Dallas,
it'll be at your disposal.

17:54.615 --> 17:59.035
It's perfect for lots of situations.
It's a headquarters on wheels.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.079
We'll take it.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.291
Uh, chief? Stop taking pictures!
Red, it's just not possible.

18:05.459 --> 18:10.671
Governor's gotta ride in it tomorrow.
He gave this manhunt top priority.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.925
But, Red... Listen,
you gotta believe me. Ha, ha. Red?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.803
What's your name?
Dick Suttle, the driver.

18:16.970 --> 18:21.265
Not anymore. Bradley?
This man stays with his vehicle.

18:21.475 --> 18:25.103
You know how to work all the gadgets?
Oh, yes, sir.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.605
Okay, take a seat.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.440
Excuse me, Red.

18:29.983 --> 18:34.070
This here's Bobby Lee.
He's a specialist with the feds.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.281
They want him to tag along.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.788
Red, what am I supposed
to tell the governor?

18:43.997 --> 18:48.084
Well, you tell him that, uh,
Miss Sally Gerber over there...

18:48.377 --> 18:51.796
from his office,
checked me out on this.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.259
Oh, hell.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.309
Hey!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.193
Hello?

19:23.620 --> 19:26.455
You coming or aren't you?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.432
Not a scratch! You hear me, Suttle?
Not a scratch!

19:44.641 --> 19:48.186
On the truck! On the trailer!
And you call me! You call me!

20:00.407 --> 20:02.867
Why the hell we stopping?

20:04.328 --> 20:08.206
You said you had a cousin near here.
So?

20:09.124 --> 20:13.127
So call him. See if we can shack there
till things cool down.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.866
Why'd he take the keys?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.912
So I won't leave him.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.416
Would you leave him?

20:55.504 --> 20:56.796
Oh, yeah.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.870
He must've moved.

21:30.539 --> 21:35.001
Probably couldn't have heard him
anyways, my ear's still bleeding.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.629
You ever try that shit again...
What?

21:39.214 --> 21:40.464
What?

21:41.967 --> 21:44.385
You were in the middle
of threatening me.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.179
It ain't a threat.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.515
It's a fact.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.396
Here, kid, take the wheel.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.360
In two seconds, I'm gonna
break your nose.

22:01.528 --> 22:02.653
That's a threat.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.916
And that's a fact.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.836
I'm gonna kill you for that.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.215
And that's a threat.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.802
Beginning to understand
the difference?

22:55.707 --> 22:59.835
Phillip, listen up.
I'm gonna run in and get some smokes.

23:00.045 --> 23:04.382
Get beer.
Here, hold this.

23:05.258 --> 23:08.761
Point it right between his eyes.
What the hell?

23:10.389 --> 23:13.432
If he so much as moves,
you pull the trigger.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.852
Right here, see?
Put your finger on it.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.569
You're a fucking crazy man.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.408
That's a fact.
You're getting the hang of this.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.676
How do? Where's your sodas?

23:48.844 --> 23:53.597
The hot ones are there. The cold ones
are in the back, in the cooler.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.280
You ever shot a gun before, boy?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.784
Pow!

24:14.494 --> 24:18.539
Knock you on your ass.
Quiet, mister.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.125
No...

24:22.252 --> 24:25.463
You ain't never shot no gun before.

24:25.964 --> 24:30.926
Living with three split-tails.
No daddy around.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.807
You'll probably grow up queer,
you know that?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.855
Now...

24:43.773 --> 24:49.320
I'm gonna lean up here
real slow and easy.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.530
Okay?

24:52.449 --> 24:55.284
Just so that we can talk.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.456
There we go.

25:00.957 --> 25:04.293
Now we can have a real man-to-man.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.923
You are a man, now, ain't you?

25:10.675 --> 25:15.221
Will this do it for you?
This and a carton of them Lucky Strikes.

25:17.974 --> 25:22.019
Those are some real cute
little underwears you got on there, boy.

25:22.646 --> 25:26.899
Your mama sew your name in them?
Initials or anything?

25:27.734 --> 25:29.109
Hmm?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.905
Let's see what you got down there.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.494
Kind of puny, ain't it?

25:41.164 --> 25:43.582
The hand is quicker than the eye.

25:50.715 --> 25:56.762
Son of a bitch.
Hell's bells, no shells.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.646
Come on up here
a little closer, boy.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.693
Those .38 shells you got up there?
Yeah.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.903
Why don't you give me a box?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.825
Agh! Goddamn! Jesus!

26:20.954 --> 26:22.329
Jesus!

26:42.183 --> 26:43.517
Here, boy.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.985
All is forgiven, boy.

26:56.740 --> 27:00.618
You best come here, boy.
You know I'm gonna find you.

28:00.845 --> 28:06.183
Hey, boy, you best hope
I don't find you.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.693
What're you gonna do? Hit me with it?

28:22.158 --> 28:24.451
But you and me are friends.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.690
You got a phone?

28:55.775 --> 28:57.234
No.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.739
Go inside, lie down till we're gone.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.250
Well, you coming?

29:17.255 --> 29:18.756
Get in.

29:42.113 --> 29:47.409
Red, I got a spot on them. A store
outside of Ben Hur, 50 miles from here.

29:47.619 --> 29:52.122
Yeah. Well, move that, uh,
roadblock on 28850 miles north.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.502
Figure they got that far?
I don't know. But they don't either.

29:56.669 --> 30:00.672
They're just happy to be out.
This is a Sunday drive for them.

30:00.965 --> 30:05.677
Sunday drive, I like that. I never
heard you use that one before.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.808
Is something bothering you?

30:11.017 --> 30:12.684
Oh, uh...

30:12.852 --> 30:15.813
It's perhaps premature, but, um...

30:15.980 --> 30:20.275
do you have an auxiliary roadblock
plan for when they split up?

30:20.443 --> 30:23.237
What makes you so sure
they're gonna split up?

30:23.404 --> 30:26.824
If you got something in your craw,
spit it out.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.410
Their situation
is one of accommodation.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.580
I don't think they'll be together long.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.417
Haynes and Pugh are opposites, right?

30:37.585 --> 30:42.005
Haynes is a criminal's criminal.
Robbery, man-on-man confrontation.

30:42.173 --> 30:47.344
Pugh has a rap sheet littered
with manslaughter, you name it.

30:47.512 --> 30:51.139
They'll split soon.
What about the hostages?

30:51.307 --> 30:54.142
What are they gonna do?
Flip a coin, see who gets to keep who?

30:54.310 --> 30:57.020
It's happened before.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.815
Either way, it's a dilemma
they'll address soon.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.985
That's why we gotta address it now.

31:03.152 --> 31:06.071
We don't have a dilemma.
Neither do they.

31:06.281 --> 31:11.577
They'll get rid of one hostage and keep
the other. If they haven't done so already.

31:14.956 --> 31:20.669
Command, put your roadblock on 288,
north about 50 miles.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.213
Roger, roadblock 288, 50 miles.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.883
That's right, 50 miles.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.467
Uh-huh.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.847
We need to talk, Chief Garnett.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.266
You can call me Red.

31:34.475 --> 31:36.059
Red...

31:36.561 --> 31:39.813
why are you so hell-bent
on embarrassing me?

31:40.023 --> 31:43.400
I'm only hell-bent on one thing.
You get to know me...

31:43.568 --> 31:47.571
you'll find having a strong backside and
a good sense of humor will get you a lot.

31:47.739 --> 31:52.367
I have a fine sense of humor. But one thing
I won't do is be your straight man...

31:52.535 --> 31:54.912
so you can play hero
to a bunch of morons...

31:55.079 --> 31:58.081
who think you're some kind
of hillbilly Sherlock Holmes.

31:58.291 --> 32:02.294
Oh, shit! Damn.

32:02.503 --> 32:08.008
Arthur Godfrey said this stuff keeps
you young. I'm not sure it's worth it.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.510
So that's my answer?

32:11.554 --> 32:14.514
This is your first time in the field?

32:14.724 --> 32:18.769
I thought so.
What was you expecting anyway?

32:19.437 --> 32:22.105
What do you think I am?
Some dumb schoolgirl...

32:22.273 --> 32:25.275
who's wandered
into the boys' locker room?

32:25.443 --> 32:28.320
You're wrong. I don't mean to boast...

32:28.529 --> 32:33.533
but I happen to be one of the two
most intelligent people in this fiasco.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.287
That's not what I asked.
I asked what you're expecting.

32:37.455 --> 32:43.085
I expected to be allowed to do the job
assigned to me by the governor.

32:43.836 --> 32:48.882
I like the governor. He and I go
quail hunting at least once a year.

32:49.092 --> 32:53.470
But he knows that win, lose or draw,
this is my ship. Understand?

32:53.638 --> 32:57.432
Yeah, I got that.
You know what that is? That's anarchy.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.645
And I call that horseshit,
to use a cowboy colloquialism.

33:01.813 --> 33:06.149
No, I'll tell you what's horseshit.
Horseshit is responsibility.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.987
That's the guy who has sleepless nights,
the guy who has the ulcers.

33:10.196 --> 33:14.366
If this thing goes bloody,
the governor, he loses a few votes.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.202
Me, I'm the one who...

33:21.749 --> 33:27.713
I'll tell you what. You see me making
a wrong move, go ahead and speak up.

33:27.922 --> 33:30.716
I might not agree with you,
but I'll listen.

33:30.925 --> 33:35.345
As for wounded pride, I'll buy
all the drinks when this is over...

33:35.555 --> 33:40.434
but right now I got better things
to think about. That fair?

33:40.601 --> 33:42.019
Mm-hm.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.729
Yeah.

33:44.814 --> 33:49.109
Good. So who's the other one?
Other one?

33:50.028 --> 33:53.030
If you're one of the two brains,
who's the other one?

33:53.614 --> 33:57.034
Haynes. We tested him in prison.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.127
Thank you.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.050
Are you gonna shoot me?

34:14.342 --> 34:15.886
No! Hell, no.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.431
Me and you are friends.

34:26.481 --> 34:31.568
If I was choosing a running buddy,
I'd take you over him any day of the week.

34:35.239 --> 34:39.242
We got a positive ID?
Yes, sir. Only the boy is hostage.

34:39.409 --> 34:42.496
Not five minutes ago,
we found this here.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.170
Yeah.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.007
At least now we know who's in charge.

34:56.469 --> 35:01.056
Hey. You ever ridden
in a time machine before?

35:01.557 --> 35:05.268
You have. What do you think this is?
A car.

35:06.813 --> 35:12.526
You're looking at this bass-ackwards.
This is a 20th century time machine.

35:12.735 --> 35:16.154
I'm the captain
and you're the navigator.

35:17.782 --> 35:24.246
Out there, that's the future.
And back there, well, that's the past.

35:24.455 --> 35:28.708
If life's moving too slow, you wanna
project yourself into the future...

35:28.876 --> 35:31.711
you step on the gas right here.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.505
See?

35:33.673 --> 35:35.340
Ha, ha.

35:35.508 --> 35:40.470
And if you want to slow her down,
hell, you just step on the brake here...

35:40.680 --> 35:43.598
and you slow her down.

35:49.188 --> 35:53.191
This is the present, Phillip.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

36:04.453 --> 36:08.498
Yes, sir, we're time-traveling
through Texas.

36:12.753 --> 36:17.549
We gotta find us a Ford. My daddy
always drove Fords, you know that?

36:23.264 --> 36:25.515
That's an intercom speaker system.

36:25.725 --> 36:29.227
Now, you can get and give information
to and from the rear vehicle.

36:29.395 --> 36:34.858
Uh-huh. How's it work?
Well, you press the power button.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.693
But if you've got
the volume turned up...

36:38.362 --> 36:39.988
Bradley, dang it!

36:40.531 --> 36:43.283
You will blow the speakers.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.327
My God...

36:45.536 --> 36:47.204
There.

36:47.413 --> 36:51.082
That ought to put his pecker in a sling,
huh, Red? Sorry, ma'am.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.586
Dick humor, unique.
Shouldn't these be roadblocked?

36:54.795 --> 36:57.088
Now, in a perfect world...

36:57.256 --> 37:01.134
we'd lock arms and thrash
the bushes until he turned up.

37:01.344 --> 37:05.180
In a perfect world,
things like this wouldn't happen.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.058
Adler, we're proceeding on FM 1491.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.895
Our locals are heading out.
You want to follow them?

37:13.064 --> 37:18.360
No, we'll just keep cruising.
He'll turn up eventually.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.094
Okay, we're gonna do
some car shopping.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.222
You ever play cowboys and INDIANs?

37:49.267 --> 37:51.101
See that Ford sedan?

37:53.020 --> 37:57.274
I want you to sneak over there
like an INDIAN and take a peek.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.026
See if the keys is in it.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.949
Don't have to if you don't want to.

38:06.117 --> 38:10.120
But I'd appreciate it,
you being the new navigator and all.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.882
Hey, Phillip! Phillip!

38:23.175 --> 38:25.885
Check for a radio too.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.915
It's got keys and a radio. I checked.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.501
Good man.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.671
Can we stop at the filling station?

39:03.382 --> 39:07.010
What for?
Number one.

39:09.430 --> 39:13.892
This here's nature, Phillip.
You just pee over by the tree.

40:40.855 --> 40:44.190
Hey! That's my car!
Start, you son of a bitch!

40:44.358 --> 40:45.483
Hey!

40:58.581 --> 41:01.624
Get in the car, Phillip! Phillip!

41:01.792 --> 41:04.043
Phillip, get in the car!

41:04.545 --> 41:06.087
Jump!

41:30.654 --> 41:34.991
Goddamn, how many RCs did you drink?
Four.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.462
Adler, if we get
a clean shot, can we take it?

41:47.671 --> 41:51.674
Red, locals wanna know, if they get
a clean shot, should they take it?

41:57.681 --> 41:59.182
No.

42:02.436 --> 42:07.148
I don't want any half-ass sergeant
taking a potshot with a deer rifle.

42:07.358 --> 42:12.237
Only thing to do, he's got the boy.
You figure he'll just give up.

42:14.031 --> 42:19.077
Maybe, maybe not.
Well, now, there's a safe bet.

42:19.286 --> 42:22.205
Well, he's better off now
than he was.

42:22.414 --> 42:26.793
That third eye Pugh is sporting on the way
to the morgue speaks otherwise.

42:27.002 --> 42:30.088
Then why not just shoot to kill?

42:30.881 --> 42:32.715
Oh, now, there's a brainstorm.

42:32.883 --> 42:36.302
Red, they forwarded the stolen vehicle
license to the roadblock.

42:36.512 --> 42:41.516
You still want to go to the farm?
Yeah. Yeah, I got a hunch.

42:44.019 --> 42:46.771
Never met a brown-eyed Phillip before.

42:46.981 --> 42:51.109
Who are you named after?
My daddy.

42:51.944 --> 42:55.822
You and your old man get along all right?
Yes, sir.

42:56.031 --> 43:00.076
Toss the ball around, play grab-ass
in the yard, that sort of thing?

43:00.327 --> 43:02.078
No, sir.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.415
Why the hell not?

43:06.500 --> 43:08.585
He ain't around, really.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.547
Well, he is or he ain't.

43:16.552 --> 43:19.387
When's the last time you saw him?

43:26.854 --> 43:30.273
Me and you got a lot
in common, Phillip.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.610
The both of us is handsome devils.

43:34.153 --> 43:36.195
We both like RC Cola.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.949
And neither one of us got
an old man worth a damn.

43:44.538 --> 43:49.542
My mama says he'll come back.
Probably when I'm 10 or so.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.130
Well, she's lying to you,
pure and simple.

43:55.049 --> 43:58.134
All right? He ain't ever coming back.

44:03.557 --> 44:06.100
Guys like us, Phillip...

44:06.310 --> 44:08.895
we gotta be on our own.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.981
Seek foolish destiny.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.984
Ha, ha, that sort of thing.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.535
You, uh...? You responsible
for the engine maintenance on that?

44:24.745 --> 44:28.122
That's right. I'm the full-time driver.
Uh-huh.

44:28.332 --> 44:32.335
What?
It's slipping a bit going into second.

44:32.503 --> 44:36.381
Seems like somebody's been
heavy-footed with the clutch.

44:36.590 --> 44:39.884
I'd put that on a list if I was you.

44:44.390 --> 44:46.015
Well...

44:46.392 --> 44:49.644
ain't no bodies here, thank God.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.940
You got the keys to this vehicle?
No.

44:54.942 --> 44:58.569
See if we got a pry bar in the car.
Yes, sir.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.495
Here you go, Red.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.791
You might want to wait in the boat.
Please.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.971
Well, there's our bureaucrat.

45:37.526 --> 45:41.821
Nice to know the boy's
in good hands. Here.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.991
I don't want...
Gallows humor, Sally.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.411
Without it,
we'd all be losing our lunch.

45:49.872 --> 45:53.166
Want some water?
No.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.362
You ready to get out of them skivvies
and into some britches?

46:23.572 --> 46:25.865
All right, then, let's go.

46:29.286 --> 46:34.624
First, we gotta come up with some
a.k.a.'s. You know, fake identities.

46:34.833 --> 46:38.586
Names to call each other
when we're around other folks.

46:38.796 --> 46:41.464
You go ahead and you think one up.

46:41.632 --> 46:44.634
Whatever name you want.
Any name I want?

46:44.802 --> 46:46.344
Any name you want.

46:52.142 --> 46:55.686
Well, hello there,
and welcome to Friendly's.

46:55.896 --> 46:58.314
Looks like the little fellow
needs some pants.

46:58.524 --> 47:03.486
As a matter of fact, shoes and new
skivvies too. He'll tell you his size.

47:03.695 --> 47:05.822
Go with the lady, Buzz.

47:06.406 --> 47:10.618
Buzz.
Buzz. Go with the lady.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.704
Buzz, what a cute little name.
Like a bee.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.486
Oh! Ha-ha-ha.

47:45.654 --> 47:49.615
Oh, look, a friendly ghost.
Say "Boo."

47:50.200 --> 47:51.951
Boo.

47:52.160 --> 47:57.373
Not very scary. But you'll have a whole year
to work on it if your daddy lets you have it.

47:57.541 --> 48:01.544
It's a good price too.
What did you go as this year?

48:01.962 --> 48:03.671
A bandit.

48:20.522 --> 48:22.398
Oh, shit!

48:22.816 --> 48:24.358
Pete.
Yeah?

48:24.568 --> 48:26.944
This is Terrance. I think I got it.
10-4.

48:30.991 --> 48:34.493
What do you think?
Look good.

48:37.247 --> 48:40.666
Will that be all for you today, sir?

48:43.462 --> 48:46.339
You folks are about the grinningest
bunch I ever seen.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.723
Mr. Willits holds
a contest every month.

48:55.933 --> 48:59.936
The friendliest employee gets
a $20 bonus.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.612
Pete, I'm all set down here. You?

49:10.656 --> 49:15.618
Copacetic. Let's just keep him tied up
till the state boys get here.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.496
The hunt continues for Butch Haynes...

49:18.705 --> 49:22.458
who escaped last night
from the security unit over in Huntsville.

49:22.668 --> 49:28.255
Haynes, 6'1 ", 185 pounds with
brown hair, is armed and dangerous.

49:28.465 --> 49:31.300
He was last seen in...
Here are the clothes.

49:31.468 --> 49:36.639
Buzz has his heart set on a Halloween
costume for next year. It is half off.

49:37.557 --> 49:40.142
Four miles south of Desdemona.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.395
Complicating attempts
to apprehend him...

49:42.604 --> 49:47.108
Haynes is believed to have
an 8-year-old boy with him as hostage.

49:47.317 --> 49:50.653
In a related story,
authorities have found the slain body...

49:50.821 --> 49:54.407
We'll get it next time.
Go wait in the car, son.

49:54.616 --> 49:58.828
Hostage taken by Haynes
and his fellow escapee, Terry Pugh.

49:59.371 --> 50:02.665
The body of Billings was found
in the trunk of his car.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.710
The car, used in the prison escape...

50:06.169 --> 50:11.007
was discarded near a farm where
another car was stolen this morning.

50:11.216 --> 50:13.968
The stolen car is a yellow Ford sedan.

50:14.177 --> 50:18.556
Anyone who spots it should contact
law enforcement officials.

50:18.765 --> 50:22.018
As we reported earlier,
the body of Terry Pugh...

50:22.185 --> 50:25.563
You're truly the friendliest clerk
I ever met.

50:29.317 --> 50:32.653
Thank you for shopping Friendly's.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.781
Copy, 149, hold your 20.

51:29.419 --> 51:30.961
Damn!

51:36.802 --> 51:38.928
What the... What the hell?

51:49.022 --> 51:50.439
He's coming back!

51:55.362 --> 51:58.489
Get out of there!
We can't lose both vehicles!

52:00.992 --> 52:04.203
I knew something was wrong
from the get-go.

52:20.679 --> 52:21.887
Agh.

52:26.643 --> 52:29.353
Look, he left his little boy!

52:33.650 --> 52:36.402
He's got the Casper costume!
He stole it!

52:43.827 --> 52:47.663
Buzz, you little shit!
Shoplifting is a crime!

52:49.708 --> 52:52.126
Up to you, Buzz!

52:59.009 --> 53:02.678
You'll never get away with this,
you little mister!

53:06.183 --> 53:08.559
You ain't so friendly.

53:14.649 --> 53:15.774
Whoa!

53:37.047 --> 53:40.758
Take them nasty skivvies off,
put these jeans on.

53:44.888 --> 53:49.099
What do you got there?
A ghost suit.

53:49.309 --> 53:50.893
From the store?

53:52.312 --> 53:53.604
You kiped it?

53:57.817 --> 54:00.527
Well, hell, Phillip, put it on.

54:01.363 --> 54:03.239
You ain't mad?

54:05.283 --> 54:09.662
Let's understand each other.
Stealing's wrong, okay?

54:09.871 --> 54:14.291
But if there's something you need bad
and you ain't got the money...

54:14.459 --> 54:17.253
it's okay to take a loaner
on the item.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.881
It's what you call
an exception to the rule.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.469
What's wrong?

54:26.388 --> 54:28.097
Nothing.

54:29.349 --> 54:32.810
You don't want to get undressed
in front of me, is that it?

54:35.647 --> 54:38.274
You embarrassed because I might
see your pecker?

54:41.444 --> 54:43.112
It's...

54:43.280 --> 54:44.863
puny.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.951
What?
It's puny.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.289
Who told you that?

54:56.126 --> 54:57.918
Let me see.

55:00.964 --> 55:03.882
Go on, I'll shoot you straight.

55:07.429 --> 55:11.390
Hell, no, Phillip.
It's a good size for a boy your age.

55:16.187 --> 55:18.022
Here they come.

55:41.629 --> 55:44.965
Haynes bought some tape, rope,
and clothes for the kid.

55:45.175 --> 55:48.677
One puzzler, they say the kid could have
gotten away, but he didn't.

55:48.845 --> 55:52.222
Probably scared to death.
well, one more thing.

55:52.432 --> 55:57.269
The kid stole a Halloween outfit.
So they're a team.

55:57.479 --> 55:59.229
With a pit stop in Noodle...

55:59.397 --> 56:01.940
they're heading for the Panhandle.
What?

56:02.150 --> 56:05.361
There's more roads than people there.
How's that happen?

56:05.528 --> 56:09.114
Poor counties. They half-finish
a road, start another.

56:09.324 --> 56:12.451
If anybody knows them back roads,
it's Red.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.870
Okay...

56:17.165 --> 56:18.749
so...

56:19.209 --> 56:24.963
I'm Robert Haynes. Everybody calls
me Butch. I was born in Amarillo...

56:25.173 --> 56:28.634
but grew up in the French Quarter
in New Orleans.

56:28.843 --> 56:31.303
What's she doing, Red?

56:32.222 --> 56:34.598
I killed a man when I was 8.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.560
How did you kill him?

56:38.853 --> 56:43.565
Shot him with a .38. There was always
one lying around the dance hall.

56:43.775 --> 56:46.151
That's what they called it,
but it was a whorehouse.

56:46.319 --> 56:48.237
That's where we lived.

56:48.405 --> 56:53.075
What did the authorities do?
Victim was wanted by the locals...

56:53.284 --> 56:57.579
so the whole thing got swept
under the carpet, Cajun-style.

56:57.789 --> 57:00.749
They didn't even send him to the juvie?
Mm-mm.

57:01.084 --> 57:05.087
Put me in school. I was three
years behind, but I catch up.

57:05.380 --> 57:09.591
Things are going pretty good now.
Yeah, they are for a while.

57:09.801 --> 57:13.762
And when I'm 12, Mama dies.
What happened?

57:13.972 --> 57:18.809
Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself
in the bathroom of the whorehouse.

57:19.018 --> 57:22.438
Post-mortem check uncovered
last-stage syphilis.

57:22.689 --> 57:26.275
Where's your father?
Nobody knows where he is.

57:26.443 --> 57:31.321
Ditched when I was 6.
He was a small-time felon.

57:31.531 --> 57:34.616
Popped back up after Mama died.

57:34.826 --> 57:39.037
He'd just been put on parole,
so he moves us back to Amarillo.

57:39.247 --> 57:43.792
A year later, I'm back in trouble.
Heh. Kill somebody else?

57:43.960 --> 57:45.836
Uh-uh.

57:46.045 --> 57:50.299
Saw a Ford coupe I couldn't resist.
So I took her for a spin.

57:50.717 --> 57:54.470
Hell, that ain't no big deal.
That's what I thought.

57:54.637 --> 58:00.058
But the judge didn't. Gave me four years
in Gatesville, toughest juvie farm in Texas.

58:00.268 --> 58:02.728
That's where he learned
to be a criminal.

58:02.896 --> 58:05.439
We've seen that before, haven't we, Red?

58:08.860 --> 58:12.237
Butch, why don't you tell us
where you're headed...

58:12.405 --> 58:14.740
and save us the trouble
of hunting you down.

58:14.949 --> 58:17.993
See, you missed it.
Because where I'm going...

58:18.203 --> 58:22.080
isn't near as important
as why I'm going there.

58:22.290 --> 58:25.167
Shit! Because I'm running,
they're chasing...

58:25.335 --> 58:29.338
I'd just as soon go north,
as south, as east, as west.

58:29.547 --> 58:31.507
It's a fun little game...

58:31.674 --> 58:35.928
but right now, Haynes doesn't have
any idea where he's headed.

58:40.225 --> 58:44.645
Hold your pointing finger
along the line of the road, okay?

58:44.854 --> 58:49.399
Okay, you got three lines
on a finger, don't you?

58:49.609 --> 58:53.946
Each one's an inch.
So how many inches to Childress?

58:56.699 --> 58:58.033
One...

58:58.201 --> 58:59.826
two...

59:00.995 --> 59:02.204
Six.

59:04.207 --> 59:07.251
You're a hell of a navigator, Phillip!

59:07.460 --> 59:10.087
A lot smarter than Terry.

59:10.672 --> 59:14.758
Of course, who you gonna brag
to about that?

59:16.886 --> 59:18.679
Lookie there!

59:21.140 --> 59:25.227
What is it?
It's kind of like a silver whale.

59:25.436 --> 59:29.565
And there's people inside,
just like old Jonah in the Bible.

59:33.444 --> 59:37.281
Go like this,
maybe they'll honk back at us.

59:41.369 --> 59:44.955
What do you think?
Well, okay, do it.

59:50.628 --> 59:52.921
You said the boy
stole a Halloween costume?

59:56.509 --> 59:59.761
Which one?
It was Casper the Friendly Ghost.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:01.930
Uh-huh. That was them.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.807
They just passed us.
What?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.976
That was them!
Turn around!

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:07.644
Bradley, turn around!

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:33.420
It's not safe to do more than 65
with this much load.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:35.213
Uh-huh.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.092
They're coming fast.

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.095
Phillip, get down in the seat
and lay down.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.474
Why?
Hell, I don't know.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.184
Because I said so.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.354
You're burning up the engine!

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:51.730
Hold on.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.109
Come on!
Take that wide!

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.590
What're you doing?
I'm following the fugitive, fool!

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:21.927
What are you doing now?

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.097
Uh, Red...

01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:27.599
Shit.

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:35.524
Red?

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.031
Red's gonna be pissed now.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.003
Oh, God!

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:02.884
Are you trying to kill us?

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.553
Shit.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.055
Yeah.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.810
Oh, my God.
Idiot!

01:02:31.622 --> 01:02:35.751
Red, they wanna know
if the boy looked okay.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.296
He was laughing and waving.
Don't tell them that.

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:40.881
No.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:47.137
They said the boy looked A-okay.
Well, that's great.

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:50.098
He'll be fine, Mrs. Perry.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.059
This'll be over before you know it.

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:57.773
You'll be home with your boy.
I promise.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.651
I want you to know
that I've okayed the use...

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:06.740
of a new high-tech mobile home
from which to conduct this manhunt.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:12.454
It's an amazingly futuristic piece
of law enforcement equipment.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:24.800
Started this road 20 years ago.
Still ain't finished.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:33.350
It appears to me
we got a decision to make.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.190
It's up to you, Phillip.

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:44.319
We can backtrack to the highway
or we can try it on foot.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.530
Where are we going?

01:03:53.871 --> 01:03:55.956
It's Alaska, Phillip.

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:58.542
Last of the wild frontier.

01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:01.920
It's pretty.
It's beautiful.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:06.424
You ever been there?
No.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.928
I just got the one postcard.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.015
But anyhoo,
back to our present dilemma.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:17.602
You feel like a hike?
How far?

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.938
Can't be more than, say...

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.190
1500 miles.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:31.241
You're probably right.
Go give our supplies a check.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:46.381
What's it look like?
A soda, some gum, and half a MoonPie.

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:50.302
Rations for one, at best.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.888
Come on.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.281
Red!

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:16.578
The governor insists on having the
trailer back for the parade tomorrow.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.499
Tell him to come get it.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.335
Yes, sir.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.846
Where are we going?
We're going trick-or-treating, Phillip.

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:44.064
What's the matter now?
We ain't allowed to trick-or-treat.

01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:45.690
Huh?

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.026
My mama doesn't allow it.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:52.989
Trick-or-treating? Why not?
Against our religion.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:57.535
It's against your...
What kind of foolishness is that?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.622
Jehovah's Witness.

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:10.548
Now, Phillip, I'm asking you.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:13.635
I ain't asking your mother,
I ain't asking Jehovah.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.805
You wanna go trick-or-treating or not?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:45.208
Okay, Phillip, all you gotta do
is knock on the door.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:49.587
And when they answer it,
you say, "Trick or treat." Got it?

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.396
Now, wait till they come.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.486
Now, Phillip.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.530
Trick or treat.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.534
If you ain't the cutest little ghost
I ever did see.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.704
Say it again.
Trick or treat, ma'am.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:27.292
Since Halloween was yesterday,
you're gonna have to trick me.

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:32.797
And you missed them caramel
popcorn balls I made up special.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.637
Just wait right here.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.599
Perfect.

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:12.420
What do you say, Phillip?
Thank you.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.353
Never underestimate the kindness
of the common man, Phillip.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.689
You sure there's no meat in there?

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:35.902
Spam maybe? Vienna sausage,
anything like that?

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.446
Mm, nothing.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:49.207
Can you make some mustard sandwiches?
Yes, sir.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.334
Well, go to it.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:07.350
Here, you can spread it with that.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:15.817
Yeah, that one's mine.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.356
Be right back.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.785
Don't be stingy with that mustard, now.

01:10:21.675 --> 01:10:24.761
Hold it right there. You can go.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.272
Butch!

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:40.360
Phillip!
Butch, help!

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.823
Grab the kids. Quick! Run!
Phillip!

01:10:45.991 --> 01:10:47.617
Forget the car, Bob.

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.914
It's only got 1000 miles on it!

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.959
Phillip, hit the brake!
Butch!

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:04.384
Oh, my!

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:20.483
Bad brakes.
That was close.

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.029
Bob Fielder.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.698
Edgar Poe.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:33.413
That scared me silly. You know,
I just had her a couple months.

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:37.625
Yeah, she's a beaut, all right.
Yeah?

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:41.713
Bob, what with my brake problem,
I'd appreciate a lift.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.678
Me and my boy live
about five miles up the road.

01:11:48.887 --> 01:11:51.639
I could pick up the car when I...
Butch!

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.772
The brake, Phillip!

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.607
Step on the brake!

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:11.743
Oh! Hell of a job, Phillip!
Never had a doubt!

01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:26.299
You all right? I'd be happy
to move the kids there.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:30.887
No trouble at all, Bob.
No trouble at all.

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.724
Thank you, sir.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.734
All right, thank you.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:47.236
Can I see your license, sir?

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:50.365
All right, thank you very much.
Bye, now.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:58.206
Can I see your license, please?
What's the problem, officer?

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:06.381
We got an escaped convict,
just a precaution. Have a nice trip.

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.216
Okay, thanks.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:30.363
We got two cars.
They got two cars they can give us, Red.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:35.743
Have them hold tight. I think we got
the best seat in the house right here.

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:40.039
Tell those roadblocks to call in dogs
and move north.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:45.711
We'll check every road and every farm
between San Angelo and Sweetwater.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.548
There's my Geritol.

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:55.847
Old MacDonald had a farm
Ee-i-ee-i-oh

01:13:56.056 --> 01:14:02.019
And on that farm he had a pig
Ee-i-ee-i-oh

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:06.441
With an oink, oink here
And an oink, oink there

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:12.071
Patsy, look at what you're doing.
Oh, no. Here.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.157
Look at what you did!

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.827
What is wrong with you?
I told you! Look at me.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:22.748
I told you twice not to jump up
and down, didn't I? Now, didn't I?

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:26.669
It's all over your father's new car!

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.882
Just get your bottom there
and stay, both of you!

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:38.848
It's okay, sugar.
Daddy still loves you.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:44.604
So much for the new car smell.
All right!

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:48.816
This'll be fine right here, Bob.

01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:58.993
But I do have one more favor to ask.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.012
Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.806
You'll get her back.

01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:29.982
It's new, so if you'd keep it under 45
for 500 miles, I'd appreciate it.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:32.860
You know I will, Bob.

01:15:39.993 --> 01:15:42.870
They look funny.
Maybe.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.164
But Bob did the right thing.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.708
What if he'd put up a fight?

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:52.547
I might've had to shoot him.
Where would that family be then?

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:55.466
No, Bob's a fine family man.

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:58.970
That's about the best thing
a fella can hope to be.

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:05.351
Hold on, we're almost there.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:11.107
Keep together.

01:16:16.446 --> 01:16:19.407
Got through at Aspermont.
Coerced a motorist.

01:16:19.866 --> 01:16:24.829
Damn. Call Amarillo and tell them we
got a notion they're headed that way.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.038
Okay, Red.

01:16:26.206 --> 01:16:31.544
Tell you the truth, I hope they make it
across the border. Let the feds take this.

01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:36.549
I got things I could be doing.
I'm hungry. We got any food?

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:40.261
I don't know. Let me look.
Uh, sir...?

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:45.850
Red, they got T-bones in the fridge.
Those were ordered special for...

01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:49.478
And Tater Tots!
He might not approve of this.

01:16:49.646 --> 01:16:52.565
That so? Mm.

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:56.068
I do like Tater Tots.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:17:00.114
Can't find a coon-ass waltz
to save my ass.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:09.206
That stuff you told me about not
trick-or-treating because of Jehovah...

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.751
was you pulling my leg?

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.336
No, sir.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.674
What else ain't you supposed to do?
We don't get Christmas.

01:17:18.842 --> 01:17:23.262
You're shitting me.
No birthdays, nor parties neither.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.683
You've never been to a carnival
neither, have you?

01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:29.226
No.

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:33.564
Cotton candy?
Seen that once. It's...

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:34.940
red.

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.693
No, it's not, it's pink.

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.862
Never ate none though.

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:43.240
Roller coasters?
Seen pictures.

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:49.538
You have a goddamn red white and blue
American right...

01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:52.249
to eat cotton candy,
ride roller coasters.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:53.793
I do?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.712
Hell yes, you do.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:08.849
Faster, Butch! Faster!

01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:12.603
Yeah! Ha, ha!

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.649
Faster!

01:18:17.734 --> 01:18:20.027
Yeah!

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:24.573
Come on, Butch, faster!

01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:37.962
Yes, sir.

01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:40.715
You fellas dig in now.
All right.

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.303
Whoo, it's hot.

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:56.397
You think you're pretty smart, now,
don't you?

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.857
Excuse me?

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:02.820
Well, you ain't smart,
but, goddamn, you are pretty.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:04.739
Please.

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:11.120
I think that, uh, business and pleasure
should just naturally mix, don't you?

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:17.251
I mean, take me. I love my work.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.212
So did Hitler.
Heh.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.382
Goddamn, you got a mouth on you.
Mm-hm.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.968
How do you like your steak, Sally?

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.928
Rare.

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:33.100
Good. I'll wipe its ass, herd it
through, and you can tear off a slab.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.562
On second thought, medium rare.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.358
I don't care who you work for.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:45.654
You're here for one reason only.
You hear me?

01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:52.119
Anything else, chief?

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.455
Yeah.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.501
You're in my office. Get out.

01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:15.184
Here you go.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:21.649
Thank you, Father, for your
bountiful nature and goodness.

01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:24.068
Amen.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.153
Now, dig in, Buzz.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.201
We call him that
because he eats like a buzzard.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:33.536
If it's dead, he'll swoop and chow.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.005
You Dottie?

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.883
Eileen. Dottie died.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:50.845
Her son runs the place, but, uh...

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.430
he ain't never here.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.724
Never?

01:20:55.934 --> 01:21:01.564
He leaves around 4. You know,
not much traffic after lunch.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:21.000
If you need me,
I'll be right over here.

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.602
Eat your food.

01:22:26.232 --> 01:22:28.651
Buzz, you go ahead
and chew on mine if you want.

01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:30.277
No, thank you.

01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:34.114
Ooh. Very polite.

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:38.827
Well, I try hard but, you know,
since his mama died...

01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:40.746
My mama's not dead.

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:48.629
Okay, Buzz, go on out in
the parking lot and chuck some rocks.

01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:08.565
So is she dead or not?

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.487
Well, his biological mother is alive.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:17.324
She gave him up for adoption
to me and my wife.

01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:20.953
My dead wife, that is.

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:24.957
She is... was Phil...

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:29.503
Buzz's stepmother. So she's his mom.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.338
Was his mom.

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:32.923
Stepmom.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:36.218
But she's dead.

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:39.722
I am so sorry.

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:20.345
Nosy little fella.

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.437
Get in the car.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.041
You mad at me?

01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.709
No.

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.714
You kissed her, huh?

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:58.383
Just barely.

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.763
Why?

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.642
Because it feels good.

01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:10.604
Ain't you seen your mama kiss a man?
No.

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.569
You kissed her backside, huh?

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:23.659
Well, it's kind of hard
to explain, I...

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.121
I know how it must've looked.

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:34.586
Hell, I don't know how it looked.
Do you love her?

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:38.382
Who?
The lady who cooked the hamburger.

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.386
Yeah, Phillip.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.263
Yeah, I love her.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.144
I kissed her butt, didn't I?

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.382
If things go our way...

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:24.011
we'll be in Alaska
in four or five days.

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:28.682
Get the jump on winter.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.109
What's wrong?

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.571
I want to go home.

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:48.368
Then why didn't you stay at the store?
Because.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:52.331
Because why?
Because I stole.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.376
They'll put me in jail.
I'll probably go to hell.

01:26:57.962 --> 01:27:01.632
Ha, ha. Same difference, Phillip.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.383
Same difference.

01:27:07.847 --> 01:27:10.265
We'll get you home soon.

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.476
I swear, okay?

01:27:18.816 --> 01:27:21.026
Butch?
Yeah.

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.489
I can drive.

01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:33.538
Done proved that, ain't you?
There's lots and lots of stuff you can do.

01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:38.710
Lots and lots of stuff.
Reach in that glove box there.

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.632
See if Bob's got a notepad
or something.

01:27:44.717 --> 01:27:46.551
Good old Bob.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:50.013
Can you write?
I can print.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:51.807
Good enough.

01:27:52.016 --> 01:27:57.729
Make a list of everything you ever
wanted to do but wasn't allowed to.

01:27:57.897 --> 01:27:59.356
Like what?

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:03.360
Like...

01:28:04.237 --> 01:28:05.570
cotton candy.

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.407
Cotton candy.

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:12.286
Hell, I don't know,
Phillip, it's your list.

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:21.169
Butch?
Yeah.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:24.089
How do you spell "rocket ship"?

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:31.221
I'll let those fellas
get a little more shut-eye.

01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:34.391
A few more hours of it, anyway.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:39.813
We'll get the patrol cars in
the morning and head up the Panhandle.

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:46.153
Does that bring back any memories?

01:28:52.076 --> 01:28:54.494
You got a file on me too?

01:28:54.704 --> 01:29:00.000
Hey, it's the '60s, Red.
They got a file on everybody, right?

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:04.755
Just because it's written down,
that don't mean it's true.

01:29:04.964 --> 01:29:07.257
True, absolutely.

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:11.428
But, uh, you did work as county
sheriff in Amarillo and Austin...

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:14.389
before you became a Ranger.

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:17.142
Right so far?

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:22.647
Haynes' juvenile court record
lists you as amicus curiae:

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:28.445
Evidence given by a non-party with
the intention of swaying the judge.

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:36.870
Usually it comes in written form,
but there was no copy attached.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.211
Silence.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:49.549
Okay. At least tell me why Haynes
did four years for a joyride, huh?

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:54.596
What about probation?
The boy had a home, a father.

01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:57.682
What do your files say about him?

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:03.688
It says he was a thief who did a little
time, got out and stayed pretty clean.

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:07.442
Your precious files are wrong.

01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:11.071
Okay.

01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:13.740
So tell me the truth.

01:30:17.328 --> 01:30:22.749
Haynes' old man,
he was a career criminal...

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:26.920
with a soft spot for whores.
One thing's for sure...

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:33.218
he beat the hell out of anything he
ever came across, screwed or fathered.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:34.928
If I...

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.266
If the judge had let
the boy go with him...

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:43.770
he'd have a rap sheet as long
as your arm within a year.

01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:48.733
Gatesville isn't so bad.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:53.864
I've known kids there
who straightened up.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.410
One even became a priest.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.871
I don't get it.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.957
Well, you don't get it.

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:08.879
In Texas, the bottom line is who
you know and what they owe you.

01:31:09.213 --> 01:31:12.966
That's how I do my job.
It's how you got your job.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:17.053
You are tough, aren't you?

01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:23.059
I bought that judge a T-bone,
and I told him to send the boy up.

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:26.438
I told him it was
the right thing to do.

01:31:29.108 --> 01:31:33.069
The judge went with me,
right down the line.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:45.290
Butch. Come on, Butch.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.334
Butch, wake up!

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:49.836
Butch.

01:32:19.825 --> 01:32:22.244
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:27.999
I work at night. Cooler.

01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:30.210
Your car break down?

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:34.548
No, me and my boy was just catching
some shut-eye in your field.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:40.387
Oh, I don't own it.
I just work it for Mr. Andrews.

01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:42.514
Where you all from?

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:45.892
Drove from Texarkana yesterday.

01:32:46.102 --> 01:32:49.229
Long haul.
You said a mouthful there.

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:54.943
No sense sleeping in the car
when I got a foldout couch in there.

01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:58.238
Don't wanna put you out.
Gotta get on the road.

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:04.160
No trouble. I'll wake you at first light.
Fill your belly with some food. Ha, ha.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.162
Send you on your way.

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.254
All right.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.028
Aah!
Aah!

01:33:41.907 --> 01:33:45.285
He wake you all up?
Now, I told you not to do that.

01:33:45.494 --> 01:33:48.580
No. It's no harm, ma'am.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:53.543
I'm Lottie, Mack's wife.
This here's my grand-baby, Cleveland.

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:56.212
Name's Cleve. I'm 6.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.633
I'm 8. Mine's Phil...

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:02.927
Buzz.

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:12.646
We got us a creek down
the way. Wanna go?

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.272
Sure thing.

01:34:15.733 --> 01:34:17.692
Morning to you.
Morning.

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.695
Rest done you all good, huh?
Want a plate?

01:34:20.863 --> 01:34:26.409
No. Hey, boy, run out there and
get my thermos out of the truck.

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:29.037
Hey, you can't hear
me or something?

01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:35.293
Boy ain't got sense
God give a chicken.

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:54.229
You want me to stay
on Highway 70?

01:34:54.438 --> 01:34:56.564
No, head on up towards Amarillo.

01:34:56.774 --> 01:35:01.152
We'll either cross him down there,
or wave goodbye at the border.

01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:06.700
Again. Do it again.

01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:11.996
Where's the boy's mother?

01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:15.125
We left her at home this time.

01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:18.545
Boys' night out kind of thing.

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.632
Say, lookie here.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.300
Lookie here!

01:35:24.927 --> 01:35:29.723
Mr. Andrews gave it to us when
he got himself a newfangled one.

01:35:29.932 --> 01:35:31.558
Jesus.

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:40.316
Now, this is music.

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:52.954
You know how long it's been
since I heard this?

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:56.374
Oh, that's an oldie, all right.

01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:02.797
Mrs. Andrews' maiden name was
Bourgeois. Half Creole herself, she is.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:05.717
Mr. Andrews,
he don't like nobody to know.

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:09.596
I suppose that's why he give them
to us. Ha-ha-ha.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:14.100
All-you-can-eat fish fry...

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:18.646
Thursday at 7:00 in the school
cafeteria. Tickets are $3.50 each.

01:36:18.814 --> 01:36:21.357
You can stuff your young'uns for half that.

01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:32.786
Dance, Lottie?

01:36:32.995 --> 01:36:36.456
Me? Goodness, no.
Here.

01:36:40.419 --> 01:36:42.420
Just follow me.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:02.315
Mr. Poe, you sure can move.
Well, I ought to be able to.

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:05.235
I was raised
in a dime-a-dance whorehouse.

01:37:05.402 --> 01:37:07.987
You're fooling me.
No, ma'am.

01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:14.869
My mama would dance out of the
frying pan and into the back room fire.

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.833
Get on your feet, Buzz.

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:25.839
You and Cleve shake a leg.
Okay.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:29.050
Well, go on. Go on!

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.971
Dance, boys.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.102
Spin me!

01:38:00.457 --> 01:38:06.087
Night before last,
Haynes escaped with another convict...

01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:10.133
Terry James Pugh, who was
found dead near Ben Hur, Texas.

01:38:10.342 --> 01:38:15.179
Shot through the head at close range.
Haynes took a hostage, a young boy...

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:27.150
We'll be leaving soon enough.

01:38:28.193 --> 01:38:31.321
I'll kill all of you,
you try anything stupid.

01:38:37.202 --> 01:38:40.872
What's wrong, Mack?
You look like you seen a ghost.

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.416
Come on, Buzz.

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.877
Time to hit the road.
Do me again.

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:47.754
Get back over here, now.

01:38:47.963 --> 01:38:49.923
Come on.
Come on, now!

01:38:50.132 --> 01:38:52.759
Come on, mister. Again.
Come on!

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.206
What'd you wanna go
and hit Cleve for, huh?

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:27.543
He didn't move fast enough
for you? Is that it?

01:39:27.711 --> 01:39:29.253
Huh?
Shh, shh.

01:39:29.421 --> 01:39:34.175
Maybe he gets excited sometimes.
He don't hear everything you say!

01:39:36.512 --> 01:39:39.430
You make me sick to my stomach.

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:54.821
Point it at him.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:57.198
I don't wanna.
Point it!

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:03.705
Now, you wanna flip, son?

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:07.291
Sure you do.

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:12.547
Just put your hands between
your legs. I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.558
He don't trust you no more.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:30.023
You gotta earn that, you know.

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:33.693
Go ahead, put your hands
between your legs.

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.761
Buzz, go out to the car,
get that rope.

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:04.557
Phillip!

01:41:28.999 --> 01:41:34.170
Now, you hold that boy,
and you tell him you love him.

01:41:49.853 --> 01:41:53.231
Cleve, I love you.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.901
No, old man! Say it like you mean it.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:00.780
This boy knows I love him.
Say it!

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.532
Please, mister.

01:42:04.118 --> 01:42:06.911
I got a sense about you.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:11.207
I know you a good man.

01:42:12.251 --> 01:42:14.836
No, I ain't a good man.

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:17.588
I ain't the worst neither.

01:42:17.923 --> 01:42:20.133
Just a breed apart.

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.224
Now, say it, Mack.

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:31.811
Say it!

01:42:33.772 --> 01:42:36.315
It don't cost nothing.

01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:40.319
Cleve...

01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:43.990
I love you.

01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:47.577
God...

01:42:49.037 --> 01:42:51.080
that's beautiful.

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:35.625
Get on your knees.

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:41.964
Put your hands behind your back.

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:32.974
You can go wait in the car
or you can watch.

01:44:34.351 --> 01:44:37.270
You're old enough to think for yourself.

01:44:54.162 --> 01:44:55.871
Close your eyes, Cleve.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.792
Lottie, you hold the boy tight.

01:45:01.169 --> 01:45:03.129
You shut your eyes too.

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:09.343
Please...

01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:11.012
ain't no use in it.

01:45:11.221 --> 01:45:14.974
Mister, I'll give you everything we got.

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:20.146
Our Father, which art in heaven...
Shh.

01:45:20.355 --> 01:45:25.609
Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven.

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:28.362
Mack, Cleve, say it with me.

01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:31.532
Give us this day our daily bread.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:35.953
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:39.915
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:43.044
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and...

01:45:43.211 --> 01:45:46.339
Forever and ever. Amen.

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.862
Phillip?

01:49:02.285 --> 01:49:05.829
Thanks for your hospitality.

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.021
Phillip?

01:49:43.994 --> 01:49:45.494
What the hell?

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:17.109
That was a hell of a thing
to do, Phillip!

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:23.741
You're a hero! Probably
be in all the papers tomorrow...

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:27.369
how you saved those folks. Truth is...

01:50:27.537 --> 01:50:30.706
I don't think I'd have
killed them though.

01:50:30.915 --> 01:50:35.127
Only killed two people
in my whole life.

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:38.339
One hurt my mama...

01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:41.383
one hurt you.

01:50:50.894 --> 01:50:55.189
What say we talk this over?
Settle things man-to-man.

01:50:56.691 --> 01:50:59.151
Then we can be on our way.

01:51:00.737 --> 01:51:02.237
I'll even...

01:51:03.031 --> 01:51:05.407
I'll even let you drive.

01:51:05.617 --> 01:51:09.453
Knock that right off your list.
How would that be?

01:51:50.245 --> 01:51:54.039
That's his car. He's afoot.

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:57.668
And he's got a pistol.
Mack says it looks like a .38.

01:52:22.944 --> 01:52:25.362
Alaska, Phillip. Wild and wooly.

01:52:26.281 --> 01:52:30.200
Man against nature.
Me personally, I like them odds.

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:33.245
I tell you my daddy lives there?

01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:37.416
He's a...

01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:42.212
He's the one sent
the picture postcard.

01:52:43.006 --> 01:52:46.216
Listen here what he says about it.
"Dear Robert:

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:52.473
Just wanted to tell you that me
leaving has nothing to do with you.

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:58.145
Alaska is a very beautiful place,
colder than hell most all the time.

01:52:58.354 --> 01:53:02.274
Someday you can come and visit...

01:53:02.484 --> 01:53:06.361
and we'll maybe get
to know each other better."

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:11.200
Short and sweet.

01:53:11.785 --> 01:53:14.119
That's the old man's style.

01:53:17.499 --> 01:53:21.627
We'll, uh... We'll just rest a while.

01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:26.548
Then you make up your mind.

01:53:28.885 --> 01:53:30.719
How's that, Phillip?

01:53:35.058 --> 01:53:37.726
Town called Happy
over in Swisher County.

01:53:37.894 --> 01:53:41.647
Radio ahead so whoever gets
there takes it nice and easy.

01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:45.943
Governor's having the mother flown in.
You want her on standby?

01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:49.029
Good idea.
Yeah, have her helicoptered in.

01:54:01.835 --> 01:54:04.670
Well, one thing's for sure now.

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.007
I definitely believe in ghosts.

01:54:12.303 --> 01:54:14.805
Never been shot before.

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.348
I'm sorry.

01:54:17.058 --> 01:54:19.309
I know you are.

01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:36.118
Truth is, if it had to happen, I'm...

01:54:36.327 --> 01:54:38.745
I'm glad it was you.

01:54:41.624 --> 01:54:44.585
As opposed to someone
I don't know, I mean.

01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:48.046
All things considered...

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:51.884
I feel pretty good.

01:55:07.108 --> 01:55:08.317
Listen up, boys!

01:55:09.903 --> 01:55:11.153
You better run.

01:55:14.532 --> 01:55:16.033
No, Phillip.

01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:21.914
I need me a time machine
with a loud radio...

01:55:22.415 --> 01:55:24.917
to take me where I'm going.

01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:30.339
Walking's for squares.

01:55:31.424 --> 01:55:33.759
Hand me that shotgun.

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:46.605
You don't think he'll hurt the boy?
No, he won't.

01:55:49.692 --> 01:55:51.985
Garnett. Tom Hendricks, FBI.

01:55:52.153 --> 01:55:55.155
You have one of our men with you?
We do.

01:55:55.365 --> 01:55:57.532
We cordoned off the area.
Tight?

01:55:57.742 --> 01:56:01.495
Watertight. Like a frog's pussy.
Sorry, ma'am.

01:56:01.704 --> 01:56:05.290
No doubt an observation based
on personal experience.

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:11.421
Where are they?

01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:13.966
By the pond,
behind that dogleg tree.

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:17.552
Officers are in a circle
around them 100 yards away.

01:56:18.554 --> 01:56:20.931
You got no problem
if I handle this?

01:56:24.894 --> 01:56:27.479
What say we both handle it?

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:31.525
Bradley.
Sir?

01:56:31.734 --> 01:56:33.735
Get me a megaphone.

01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:36.154
One other thing, chief.
Huh?

01:56:36.364 --> 01:56:39.449
Haynes is wounded.
The boy gut-shot him.

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:42.035
You're kidding?

01:56:44.956 --> 01:56:47.499
Red. Megaphone.

01:56:54.048 --> 01:56:57.801
Butch Haynes. This is Red
Garnett of the Texas Rangers.

01:56:57.969 --> 01:57:01.763
I know you're hurt.
We got 20, 30 armed men up here.

01:57:01.931 --> 01:57:04.224
Look around,
you'll see I'm shooting you straight.

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:10.188
For me? I'm touched. I'm afraid
you'll have to back it up a step or two.

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:12.274
I'm headed to Mexico!

01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:14.818
You're headed the wrong direction.

01:57:15.403 --> 01:57:17.029
Lying to them, of course.

01:57:17.196 --> 01:57:21.616
I'll tell you what. You let the
boy go, you and I'll talk about it.

01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:25.412
Well, I appreciate the offer, captain!

01:57:26.831 --> 01:57:30.333
But you know I can't do that!

01:57:31.335 --> 01:57:35.672
If you and your pals
back out of here, well...

01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:38.884
I'll drop the boy at the border!

01:57:39.677 --> 01:57:44.222
If you don't,
I'll shoot him in the head!

01:57:45.016 --> 01:57:46.516
I mean it!

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:54.024
Don't look at me like that.

01:57:54.984 --> 01:57:57.402
I don't even have a gun.

01:58:03.159 --> 01:58:06.161
What did you do
with the pistola anyway?

01:58:08.122 --> 01:58:10.415
Dropped it in the well.

01:58:14.962 --> 01:58:16.463
That's good thinking.

01:58:17.131 --> 01:58:19.716
They get away,
we're right back where we started.

01:58:19.884 --> 01:58:24.471
He kills the boy, he'll get the chair.
He's killed two in two days.

01:58:24.639 --> 01:58:28.892
We don't know he killed them.
Well, he wasn't sitting at home.

01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:33.230
Besides, who killed Pugh? Casper?
All right, knock it off!

01:58:33.523 --> 01:58:37.400
By the look of things,
it won't make too much difference anyway.

01:58:38.569 --> 01:58:42.572
Concentrate on getting the boy.
Where do you want me, sir?

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:46.368
Right here on the hood.
Can you handle that one?

01:58:46.577 --> 01:58:49.955
Yes, I can, sir. Excuse me.

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:12.060
See, Phillip?

01:59:14.063 --> 01:59:16.356
Dreams do come true.

01:59:17.608 --> 01:59:22.612
There's your rocket ship.
You think I'll get a ride in it?

01:59:23.614 --> 01:59:25.490
Today's the day.

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:29.578
That would be the boy's mother.
Go help her out, Adler.

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:51.224
All right, Butch.
We got the boy's mama here.

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:02.861
What's wrong?
It's my mama.

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:08.241
Now that you got yourself
a ghost suit...

02:00:08.492 --> 02:00:11.161
think she'll let you
trick-or-treat?

02:00:12.121 --> 02:00:14.206
I got to do one house.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.209
Come here.

02:00:22.465 --> 02:00:26.593
Put your... Put your mask back on.

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:32.224
Turn around and scare them.

02:00:32.975 --> 02:00:37.562
Hello? Please. He's my only son.

02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:40.815
I'll give you money, whatever I can.

02:00:41.025 --> 02:00:44.986
Please! I just wanna
take him home with me.

02:00:46.447 --> 02:00:48.073
Goddamn this son of a bitch.

02:00:48.282 --> 02:00:50.825
Let me see it, Red.
Here, Bradley.

02:00:50.993 --> 02:00:53.453
You ready to go home?

02:00:55.915 --> 02:00:57.415
Yes, sir.

02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:04.089
Hey, captain! You got any candy?

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:05.966
What?

02:01:06.175 --> 02:01:10.762
Candy! You know, Halloween candy!
Popcorn balls...

02:01:10.972 --> 02:01:13.932
caramel apples, gum!
Shit like that.

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.267
You all hungry?

02:01:15.476 --> 02:01:18.603
You find me some candy...

02:01:19.647 --> 02:01:21.606
I'll deliver up a ghost!

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.442
I got it.
Get candy.

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:27.279
Okay, everybody! Got any gum, candy?

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.614
Any Juicy Fruit? Put it in there.

02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:32.617
Let's go! Come on.
We ain't got any time.

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:36.288
His old lady's gotta swear to take him
trick-or-treating every year!

02:01:36.831 --> 02:01:40.959
You all set?
You say when, I'll say dead.

02:01:41.168 --> 02:01:43.128
Give me your list.
Butch?

02:01:43.296 --> 02:01:45.463
Give me your list. Come on.

02:01:45.673 --> 02:01:47.590
Come on, come on.

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:50.385
One more thing!

02:01:50.761 --> 02:01:54.639
She's gotta promise
to take him to the fair...

02:01:54.849 --> 02:02:00.186
for roller coasters
and cotton candy whenever he wants!

02:02:03.899 --> 02:02:08.028
I wanna go home. My mama's not bad.
She gives me those things.

02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:11.573
Don't kid a kidder, Phillip.

02:02:17.663 --> 02:02:22.334
I know just...
I know just how you feel, Phillip.

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.502
She promises!

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:28.173
Make her say it!

02:02:30.718 --> 02:02:33.511
I... I promise!

02:02:33.721 --> 02:02:39.017
Can we trust her?
She's a real good mama.

02:02:43.356 --> 02:02:47.275
When you get home, you hide this.

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:53.740
You're not bad, are you, Butch?

02:02:56.952 --> 02:02:58.453
Yeah.

02:03:00.373 --> 02:03:02.082
Now, listen, Buzz.

02:03:02.291 --> 02:03:03.875
I want you...

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:08.838
All right, now I want you
to step out there real slow...

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:11.424
keeping your paws in the air.

02:03:11.634 --> 02:03:15.428
All right, now I want you
to strut over to them cops...

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:19.224
and yell, "Trick or treat."

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:25.980
What are you gonna do?
Something will come to mind.

02:03:34.907 --> 02:03:36.408
Bye, Phillip.

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:39.744
It's been one hell of a ride.

02:03:44.417 --> 02:03:47.085
All right, captain!

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:52.298
Make way for
Casper the Friendly Ghost!

02:03:53.717 --> 02:03:55.760
Friendliest ghost I know.

02:04:00.558 --> 02:04:02.809
Put your mask on.

02:04:04.311 --> 02:04:06.771
Put your paws in the air.

02:04:10.526 --> 02:04:14.362
Now go tell them like I told you to.

02:04:14.822 --> 02:04:16.322
Red...

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:19.033
Take a look at this.

02:04:19.994 --> 02:04:21.703
Oh, it's him...

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.998
Come on, boy. Keep walking.

02:04:41.849 --> 02:04:43.141
Keep walking, boy!

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:51.524
Call your boy.
Run! Phillip, run!

02:04:51.734 --> 02:04:55.987
Phillip, honey, come on! Phillip!

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:59.991
He thought better of releasing him.
It doesn't mean that.

02:05:12.713 --> 02:05:18.051
Personally, I think we negotiated
a pretty fair deal.

02:05:18.511 --> 02:05:21.471
Unless there's something else
you want?

02:05:23.057 --> 02:05:25.600
Do they want to shoot you?

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.545
Stay on ready.
Yes, sir.

02:06:07.768 --> 02:06:09.769
Well, I've seen it all now.

02:06:10.271 --> 02:06:13.731
What's he up to?
Damned if I know.

02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:16.234
He's giving himself up.

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:18.570
Keep in mind, he still has a gun.

02:06:20.614 --> 02:06:26.035
So I guess...
I guess that's it for Alaska, Phillip.

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:32.083
Chief, we got an armed killer
and an innocent boy out there.

02:06:33.127 --> 02:06:36.504
You clean?
As a whistle.

02:06:36.714 --> 02:06:39.257
All right, you keep him locked down.

02:06:39.675 --> 02:06:41.759
Don't squeeze till I say when, you hear?

02:06:42.177 --> 02:06:44.470
Where the hell you going?

02:07:14.168 --> 02:07:15.668
I'm unarmed...

02:07:17.087 --> 02:07:18.963
so throw your gun down.

02:07:19.214 --> 02:07:21.924
If I had a pistola...

02:07:23.719 --> 02:07:26.804
I'd be headed
in the other direction.

02:07:27.598 --> 02:07:32.101
My partner here, he got...
He got rid of the evidence.

02:07:37.107 --> 02:07:38.858
Do I know you, friend?

02:07:40.944 --> 02:07:43.738
No. Not really.

02:07:43.947 --> 02:07:45.365
Huh.

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:51.412
Well, look, I wanna talk to the boy.

02:07:51.622 --> 02:07:55.083
Then we can take care of business.

02:07:55.292 --> 02:07:56.334
How's that?

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:59.253
Only take a second.

02:08:01.465 --> 02:08:02.465
Okay.

02:08:10.099 --> 02:08:12.016
I wanna give you something.

02:08:12.184 --> 02:08:14.394
Hold him. If he makes a move...

02:08:14.812 --> 02:08:16.896
Give it a second.

02:08:22.152 --> 02:08:24.862
Maybe someday you'll get to go...

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.864
He's going for his weapon!

02:08:29.702 --> 02:08:30.910
No!

02:08:32.329 --> 02:08:35.206
Oh, God, no!
Keep everybody back!

02:08:36.125 --> 02:08:38.376
Unh.
Butch!

02:08:41.547 --> 02:08:46.759
Damn, Buzz.
Shot twice in the same day.

02:09:02.443 --> 02:09:07.405
No need to worry.
Can't hurt nobody now.

02:09:07.823 --> 02:09:09.907
Oh, my God!

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:15.913
Doesn't have a gun, chief.
Butch!

02:10:01.335 --> 02:10:04.545
Butch! Butch!

02:10:08.717 --> 02:10:10.510
Butch!

02:10:11.386 --> 02:10:14.263
Butch! Butch!

02:10:16.558 --> 02:10:17.308
Butch!

02:10:59.852 --> 02:11:02.144
Whoa, whoa! Back off!
Easy, Red!

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:06.607
What the hell was that all about?
I didn't say "when."

02:11:16.577 --> 02:11:18.035
Goddamn it!

02:11:19.079 --> 02:11:22.164
Red, I thought he had a gun too.

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:25.126
There was just no way of knowing.

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:49.609
You know you did
everything you could...

02:11:49.818 --> 02:11:51.569
don't you?

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.241
I don't know nothing.

02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.914
Not one damn thing.
