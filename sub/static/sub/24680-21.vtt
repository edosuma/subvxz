00:00.442 --> 00:03.477
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.477 --> 00:06.388
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.388 --> 00:07.916
of the Major Case Squad.

00:07.916 --> 00:10.714
These are their stories.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.790
I tried calling you last night.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.343
I was there.
I'm a heavy sleeper.

00:16.343 --> 00:19.324
Listen, you held the cash
for the 50-50 raffle.

00:19.324 --> 00:22.698
There should have been $240.
You gave me $210.

00:22.698 --> 00:25.091
Big deal. I miscounted.
What is it, 20?

00:25.091 --> 00:28.190
Thirty, Tommy.
Forty minus ten.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.847
And you were late yesterday.

00:29.847 --> 00:32.531
- Five minutes.
- Ten, since we're counting.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.693
It's getting worse.
Something going on?

00:36.821 --> 00:41.044
What, I'm the only one runs late?

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:51.372 --> 00:55.667
Tommy! You scared me.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.342
You alone down there?

00:57.342 --> 01:00.819
Just me and the fabric softener.

01:00.819 --> 01:03.004
I'll have these shirts done for you tomorrow.

01:03.004 --> 01:05.006
You didn't see three guys cutting through?

01:05.006 --> 01:08.679
No. Was there a break-in?

01:10.276 --> 01:14.511
Just go back to your room.
Keep the door locked, okay, sis?

01:16.107 --> 01:17.836
Hey, chico,
Sergeant missed you at the muster.

01:17.836 --> 01:18.823
He's looking for you.

01:18.823 --> 01:21.964
See me shaking in my boots, chico?

01:21.964 --> 01:25.565
You hurt yourself?
Your left arm.

01:28.951 --> 01:31.341
Hope she was worth it, chico.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.547
Your wife's always worth it, chico.

01:44.853 --> 01:48.157
Son of a bitch!
I'm not gonna take this!

01:51.730 --> 01:55.192
Every time! Every single time!

02:01.615 --> 02:09.252
- Beer?
- I'll just take these.

02:09.252 --> 02:12.615
I'm not turning around, but who just
came in here? Three guys?

02:12.615 --> 02:16.750
Tommy, don't start.

02:16.750 --> 02:21.117
You gotta smoke outside.
We've been over this.

02:55.226 --> 02:58.875
Hey. Hey, easy. Don't...

Law & Order CI 
3x21 Consumed

03:55.793 --> 03:58.370
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/05/23

04:01.303 --> 04:03.575
First report came in just after midnight.

04:03.575 --> 04:05.739
No eyewitnesses so far.

04:05.739 --> 04:09.259
We're canvassing limo drivers,
cleaning crews.

04:09.259 --> 04:11.571
Well, his tuxedo's well-worn.
He works for a living.

04:11.571 --> 04:14.563
Maybe a maitre d' or a waiter.

04:14.563 --> 04:17.685
His shoes would be in better shape.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.137
He could be a musician.

04:19.137 --> 04:23.614
If he is, I've never heard of him.
Eduardo Mercaldo, 50.

04:23.614 --> 04:26.658
Address up on the West Side.

04:26.658 --> 04:31.815
No family pictures.
Credit card, MetroCard.

04:31.815 --> 04:36.119
Let's see you guess 
what instrument he plays.

04:37.349 --> 04:41.297
He probably doesn't play the horn.
He's missing too many teeth.

04:42.118 --> 04:45.388
No calluses from a guitar or drumsticks.

04:45.388 --> 04:48.840
But his hands, they have a long span.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.861
Fingernails are trimmed short.

04:51.861 --> 04:53.528
Perfect for piano.

04:53.528 --> 04:58.296
So, Eddie the piano player.
Check piano bars in the area.

05:00.486 --> 05:03.296
Here.

05:06.804 --> 05:10.503
Shot twice.
That's what brought him down.

05:10.503 --> 05:14.255
The killer moved closer,
shot him through the heart.

05:14.255 --> 05:17.194
Maybe Eddie forgot to play his request.

05:17.194 --> 05:19.932
Let's see the other one.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.937
We got a second round of shots fired
about three minutes after the first.

05:23.937 --> 05:27.711
Took a while to find this guy,
the way sounds echo around down here.

05:27.711 --> 05:32.306
Ramon Ortiz, 36. No address.

05:32.306 --> 05:35.899
Just two shots this time.

05:35.899 --> 05:39.834
One in the leg to bring him down.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.774
The other right through his heart.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.778
The shooter's getting more efficient.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.511
The 911 report we got mentioned
six shots fired, total.

05:48.511 --> 05:49.965
We only count five.

05:49.965 --> 05:53.355
That's what I mean,
about the echo down here.

05:55.540 --> 05:59.844
Could be a truck backing up,
but I don't hear an engine.

05:59.844 --> 06:02.721
Sounds like it's coming from over there.

06:04.397 --> 06:08.845
He got an entry card for the garage.

06:11.092 --> 06:13.483
Looks like he got shot going in.

06:13.483 --> 06:18.131
Only one shot this time?
Hell of a learning curve.

06:20.603 --> 06:23.053
I think I've got a shell casing in here.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.772
Looks like a nine-mil.

06:24.772 --> 06:27.631
The shooter probably picked up
his casings at the other sites.

06:27.631 --> 06:31.701
Alejandro Alvarez, 33.
Stockbroker.

06:31.701 --> 06:33.667
A few hundred bucks in cash.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.178
Mercaldo, Ortiz, Alvarez.

06:36.178 --> 06:40.215
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
it's just a coincidence.

06:40.215 --> 06:42.745
I don't want it characterized
as a racial thing yet.

06:42.745 --> 06:45.708
Maybe the victims were all in the same
bar and pissed off the same guy.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.202
Eddie Mercaldo's piano bar
says he was there all night.

06:48.202 --> 06:52.733
There was no disturbance, and nobody
remembers ever seeing the stockbroker there.

06:52.733 --> 06:56.673
Doesn't lay out like a rage spree.
It wasn't impulsive.

06:56.673 --> 07:00.632
The killer shot three people
in 10 minutes, no eyewitnesses,

07:00.632 --> 07:04.387
and then got away while the zone
was flooded with patrol cars.

07:04.387 --> 07:09.222
So the guy spent time downtown,
staking out his victims, his escape routes.

07:09.222 --> 07:13.967
He also spent time on a target range.
He made every shot count.

07:13.967 --> 07:18.107
Except for the one that fell into the grate.

07:18.107 --> 07:20.293
He took the time to pick up all his casings.

07:20.293 --> 07:22.785
He's afraid that we'll trace his weapon.

07:22.785 --> 07:26.242
Maybe he's used it before in another crime.

07:28.624 --> 07:31.564
We have a winner. It's NYPD.

07:31.564 --> 07:33.572
The casing matches up with a Glock

07:33.572 --> 07:36.737
that was used in a line-of-duty
shooting a year ago.

07:36.737 --> 07:40.391
The weapon was assigned to
an Officer Thomas Callahan,

07:40.391 --> 07:42.313
currently at the 5-1 in the Bronx.

07:42.313 --> 07:44.282
- Use your phone?
- Sure.

07:44.282 --> 07:47.394
Can you check to see
if it was reported stolen?

07:47.394 --> 07:50.895
No. No report.

07:50.895 --> 07:54.017
How about the disposition of
the line-of-duty shooting?

07:54.017 --> 07:57.038
The shooting was ruled self-defense.

07:57.038 --> 07:59.574
Callahan was cleared and 
returned to active duty.

07:59.574 --> 08:03.851
Not so active.
He missed roll call this morning.

08:04.940 --> 08:09.192
Hey! Hey, down here!
Help me! Help me!

08:09.192 --> 08:11.747
Somebody help me! Help!

08:11.747 --> 08:13.650
Help me. I'm a cop.

08:13.650 --> 08:16.179
Come on.

08:16.715 --> 08:19.612
Please help me.

08:25.725 --> 08:28.088
Where am I? Where am I?

08:28.088 --> 08:30.895
Hudson Hospital Prison Ward
Thursday, April 22

08:30.895 --> 08:34.011
They brought him in half an hour ago.
Broken leg, bruises.

08:34.011 --> 08:37.032
He crawled out of a subway tunnel
four blocks from the shootings.

08:37.032 --> 08:38.302
We heard he had a weapon.

08:38.302 --> 08:40.126
Yeah, a.38 from his ankle holster.

08:40.126 --> 08:42.982
It was empty though.
The rounds had all been fired.

08:42.982 --> 08:44.339
Is that his file? 
We're gonna need that.

08:44.339 --> 08:47.203
Yeah. His P.B.A. delegate's on his way.

08:47.203 --> 08:50.021
Callahan's brother officers 
are already here.

08:50.021 --> 08:53.412
Great. A frat party.
You mind, fellas?

08:53.412 --> 08:55.753
We need a few minutes
with your brother officer.

08:55.753 --> 08:59.254
Officer Callahan, I'm Detective Eames.
This is Detective Goren.

08:59.254 --> 09:02.319
We're from Major Case.
Anybody tell you what's going on?

09:02.319 --> 09:05.136
Someone's throwing bullets
around downtown last night.

09:05.136 --> 09:06.713
That's what we thought.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.543
Maybe you were chasing someone
in the tunnel, you know, a suspect.

09:09.543 --> 09:13.530
No. Look, I was at home watching
television. Next thing I know,

09:13.530 --> 09:16.164
I'm in a tunnel with a broken leg.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.592
Anything else, I don't remember.

09:17.592 --> 09:21.957
This blackout, maybe you were doing
shots in front of the TV, popping pills...

09:21.957 --> 09:24.350
Major Case Lady, take a big bite, okay?

09:24.350 --> 09:25.969
I'm not a dope head, I'm not a drunk.

09:25.969 --> 09:28.195
And you're not smart enough
to hide your temper.

09:28.195 --> 09:32.475
You remember firing your 
ankle piece, your .38?

09:32.475 --> 09:35.560
Yeah. When I was in the tunnel
with my broken leg,

09:35.560 --> 09:39.862
I shot out my gun at the wall
to try and get someone's attention.

09:39.862 --> 09:42.399
And what about your
other piece, your Glock?

09:42.399 --> 09:43.585
Do you know where that is?

09:43.585 --> 09:45.241
Are you gonna tell me? I don't remember.

09:45.241 --> 09:47.225
You remember your 
line-of-duty shooting?

09:47.225 --> 09:51.427
Three men jumped you at night
in the projects up in the Bronx.

09:51.427 --> 09:55.488
An experience like that must've
made you adjust your view of things.

09:55.488 --> 09:57.327
I got over it.

09:57.327 --> 10:02.386
These three men, they were African 
American, Hispanic, Hispanic, right?

10:02.386 --> 10:04.795
One of them was Hispanic.

10:04.795 --> 10:07.581
- Did he look like this?
- Nah.

10:07.581 --> 10:10.403
Or like this? Or like this?

10:10.403 --> 10:11.793
No. Who are these guys?

10:11.793 --> 10:13.412
The guys who were shot last night.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.049
With a Glock.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.912
We retrieved a casing from a grate.

10:16.912 --> 10:19.933
It matched your weapon.

10:19.933 --> 10:21.733
I got nothing to do with them.

10:21.733 --> 10:25.616
You were downtown last night.
What was the purpose?

10:25.616 --> 10:27.518
I don't remember.

10:27.518 --> 10:29.075
I never come down here.

10:29.075 --> 10:31.219
Tommy, we find that hard to believe.

10:31.219 --> 10:34.446
And we have a witness who saw
you at Harrison's Steakhouse.

10:34.446 --> 10:37.621
- It's on Maiden and Cedar.
- Never been there.

10:37.621 --> 10:39.727
You guys are not gonna 
pin this on me, okay?

10:39.727 --> 10:45.011
I'm not saying nothing until
my delegate and my lawyer get here.

10:45.885 --> 10:48.596
Just got word.
They found his gun in a trash can,

10:48.596 --> 10:51.720
one station away from where
this weasel popped up.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.706
He's done.

10:54.706 --> 10:57.577
There is no corner of Maiden and Cedar.

10:57.577 --> 11:00.518
You really think this guy doesn't
know his way around downtown?

11:00.518 --> 11:02.722
The line-of-duty shooting...

11:02.722 --> 11:06.193
Callahan fired seven shots.

11:06.193 --> 11:08.049
All but one missed.

11:08.049 --> 11:10.719
He's only been to the firing 
range twice since.

11:10.719 --> 11:14.481
I didn't think you could actually score
this low and still keep your badge.

11:14.481 --> 11:17.856
This guy is no Wild Bill Hickok.

11:17.856 --> 11:22.498
Maybe he hooked up 
with someone who is.

11:25.991 --> 11:28.947
He's well-liked.
It's what I told I.A. an hour ago.

11:28.947 --> 11:31.349
When we talked to Tommy,
we had a hard time pinning down

11:31.349 --> 11:34.083
what would make him so well-liked.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.267
He's always there when you need a favor.

11:36.267 --> 11:37.872
He covers for the guys on holidays.

11:37.872 --> 11:41.203
What we noticed is that
he's had a lot of partners,

11:41.203 --> 11:45.563
especially in the last year,
like this one here.

11:45.563 --> 11:48.940
Vasquez.
He lasted less than three weeks.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.037
Vasquez was smoking in the patrol car.

11:51.037 --> 11:52.666
Tommy's got asthma or something.

11:52.666 --> 11:55.314
They couldn't work it out,
so Tommy filed a report.

11:55.314 --> 12:00.661
Maybe the old Tommy would've
come to you instead, right?

12:00.661 --> 12:06.635
But since his self-defense shooting,
his fuse got shorter.

12:06.635 --> 12:08.575
You could say that.

12:08.575 --> 12:10.196
Anything else you could say?

12:10.196 --> 12:14.415
Something that never made it into a report.

12:14.415 --> 12:16.370
He's gotten careless.

12:16.370 --> 12:20.221
He's distracted?
How's his attendance?

12:20.221 --> 12:22.866
Every other morning,
he runs late.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.264
Does he have a second job?

12:25.264 --> 12:26.950
Not that he told me.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.565
I don't know what he does at night.

12:28.565 --> 12:32.216
Maybe he's out hunting.

12:32.216 --> 12:34.593
Apartment of Tommy Callahan
Queens, New York 
Friday, April 23

12:34.593 --> 12:38.352
Three alarm clocks,
all set for 6:00 a.m.

12:38.352 --> 12:42.001
If he's not getting up,
it's not for lack of trying.

12:42.001 --> 12:45.215
Eggplant Parmesan.

12:45.215 --> 12:47.304
Somebody's bringing him 
home-cooked meals.

12:47.304 --> 12:51.388
I can't imagine a girlfriend
setting foot in this place.

12:57.560 --> 13:02.684
Hmm. Looks like there's somebody
whose smoking he doesn't mind.

13:02.684 --> 13:06.569
Don't see any lipstick.
Could be his partner in crime.

13:06.569 --> 13:09.960
I count four different brands.

13:12.296 --> 13:14.200
Light starch.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.899
His domestic diva's been busy.

13:21.027 --> 13:25.419
Nothing says rage-aholic
like a punch in the wall.

13:26.302 --> 13:29.041
His neighbor must love him.

13:29.623 --> 13:32.099
Tommy's always courteous and helpful.

13:32.099 --> 13:34.881
It's nice having a police officer
in the building, I'll say that.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.541
And noisy too.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.835
Maybe the TV now and then.

13:38.835 --> 13:44.508
Oh, no. My partner meant when
Tommy punched the wall there.

13:44.508 --> 13:47.106
I wouldn't know that.

13:48.071 --> 13:50.812
I mean, everybody has their bad days.

13:50.812 --> 13:53.273
You're very lucky he didn't
knock those lamps over.

13:53.273 --> 13:56.239
These are Muranos, aren't they?

13:56.239 --> 13:57.755
Did you get them at Bergmann's?

13:57.755 --> 14:00.038
Oh, gracious, no. I work there.

14:00.038 --> 14:02.393
I couldn't afford that furniture.

14:02.393 --> 14:04.337
They're knockoffs.

14:04.337 --> 14:09.199
You ever see any visitors over
at Tommy's, or hear them?

14:09.199 --> 14:13.079
No. Tommy keeps pretty much to himself.

14:13.079 --> 14:16.267
Eggplant Parmesan.

14:16.267 --> 14:18.618
That's you.

14:18.618 --> 14:22.336
No. Tommy's got the same 
containers next door.

14:22.336 --> 14:24.729
Oh, yes.

14:24.729 --> 14:27.307
It's just as easy to cook
for two as it is for one.

14:27.307 --> 14:29.455
Same go for ironing?

14:29.455 --> 14:31.728
The poor man can't even sew a button.

14:31.728 --> 14:34.425
He works such long hours
and those late shifts.

14:34.425 --> 14:36.532
Late shifts?

14:36.532 --> 14:37.908
What time does he get home?

14:37.908 --> 14:41.092
Sometimes I hear him...
after 4:00 a.m.

14:41.092 --> 14:42.670
4:00 a.m.?

14:42.670 --> 14:47.006
That's not a late shift.
That's last call.

14:48.094 --> 14:51.324
It was very sudden. Boom. He...

14:51.324 --> 14:54.593
How can I say it?
He just dropped dead.

14:54.593 --> 14:59.023
He and two other men all
on the same night, downtown.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.804
Did he leave any will or final instructions?

15:01.804 --> 15:03.645
Apparently not.

15:03.645 --> 15:07.301
His death has made me reexamine things.

15:07.301 --> 15:10.267
I can't afford to continue to represent you.

15:10.267 --> 15:12.536
Don't do this, John.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.755
- Everything can get straightened out.
- When it does, you let me know.

15:15.755 --> 15:21.099
Until then, I'm sorry, Bing.
Best of luck.

15:25.203 --> 15:26.923
Yeah, sure. Tommy's been 
coming in for years.

15:26.923 --> 15:28.406
He lives but three blocks away.

15:28.406 --> 15:29.760
He come in alone?

15:29.760 --> 15:32.176
Yeah.Sometimes around 7:00,
sometimes around 11:00.

15:32.176 --> 15:34.858
Just he, himself and him.

15:37.088 --> 15:40.501
These loosies are the same
brands we found at his place.

15:40.501 --> 15:42.670
He doesn't smoke,
so who buys them?

15:42.670 --> 15:44.935
He doesn't smoke?
That's news to me.

15:44.935 --> 15:47.489
He buys those and smokes 
them like a chimney.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.793
You actually saw him smoke?
Where, here?

15:49.793 --> 15:51.007
I don't let him smoke in here,

15:51.007 --> 15:53.868
even if he is a cop
and even if it is late at night.

15:53.868 --> 15:55.873
Last Tuesday night, he came in?

15:55.873 --> 15:57.329
Yeah.
네

15:57.329 --> 15:59.580
And the same thing happened 
with the smokes?

15:59.580 --> 16:01.625
Yeah. Then he asked if I saw
three guys come in.

16:01.625 --> 16:05.322
He always asks if three guys
are following him.

16:05.322 --> 16:09.323
When you see him walk,

16:09.323 --> 16:14.285
did you notice if he's clumsy or weaving?

16:14.285 --> 16:16.370
Nah. Stiff like a robot.

16:16.370 --> 16:21.185
When you talk to him, does he respond,
or does he act like he's in his own world?

16:21.185 --> 16:23.786
In his own world.

16:23.786 --> 16:25.511
Carver's ready to get
an indictment on Callahan.

16:25.511 --> 16:28.341
He wants to know if he should start
working on one for this mystery partner.

16:28.341 --> 16:30.626
The partner might not be 
a mystery much longer.

16:30.626 --> 16:32.632
Okay, thank you.

16:32.632 --> 16:36.491
The hospital had Tommy under
sedation since he was brought in.

16:36.491 --> 16:39.811
We need to talk to Carver,
get him off sedation.

16:39.811 --> 16:42.001
This is better for us how?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.230
It's better for him.

16:46.394 --> 16:50.775
Son of a bitch.
Locked the damn window.

16:50.775 --> 16:54.716
I'm in for it now. Hey, sister.

16:54.716 --> 16:56.067
Going for a smoke?

16:56.067 --> 16:59.804
Yeah. I don't have much time.

16:59.804 --> 17:01.361
Do you know who's out there?

17:01.361 --> 17:03.862
Yeah, three guys.
You seen 'em, right?

17:03.862 --> 17:05.969
There's a lot of people out there.

17:05.969 --> 17:09.382
You don't know who we are, do you?

17:09.382 --> 17:11.627
- No. What are you, cops?
- That's right.

17:11.627 --> 17:14.165
We talked to you about when you
broke your leg in the subway.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.740
I don't remember that. I gotta go.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.439
You can't go anywhere. You're under arrest.

17:17.439 --> 17:21.106
- Hey, get off me! Get off me!
- Calm down, Tommy!

17:21.106 --> 17:22.150
Your doctor's right here.

17:22.150 --> 17:23.890
Tommy, this is Dr. Barnes.

17:23.890 --> 17:27.191
You've got to wake up.
You've got to wake up!

17:36.842 --> 17:40.312
Dr. Barnes? Um...

17:40.312 --> 17:42.521
What's going on?

17:42.521 --> 17:44.039
How come I'm out of bed?

17:44.039 --> 17:46.449
It's all right, Tommy.
We're putting you back to bed,

17:46.449 --> 17:49.351
and we'll give you something
to help you sleep through the night.

17:49.351 --> 17:51.622
Okay, guys.

17:52.708 --> 17:55.327
He seems to have full-blown parasomnia.

17:55.327 --> 17:59.480
If he hadn't been taken off sedatives,
we might not have caught it.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.018
What are the chances he killed
three people in his sleep?

18:06.018 --> 18:08.669
Virtually nil.

18:08.669 --> 18:12.182
But the person who did,
knew that Tommy had this problem...

18:12.182 --> 18:14.839
and brought him along for the ride.

18:14.839 --> 18:18.930
A sleepwalker with a gun.
The perfect fall guy.

18:23.546 --> 18:27.423
Son of a bitch.
Locked the damn window.

18:27.423 --> 18:30.737
I'm in for it now. Hey, sister.

18:30.737 --> 18:32.351
Going for a smoke?

18:32.351 --> 18:36.155
Yeah. I don't have much time.

18:38.364 --> 18:40.537
I sound like a damn lunatic.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.342
You had no idea you had this condition?

18:44.126 --> 18:47.191
No. I used to sleepwalk when
I was a kid, but I grew out of it.

18:47.191 --> 18:51.029
And you never noticed the punch in
the wall or the cigarettes in the ashtray?

18:51.029 --> 18:55.253
I... just thought I had too much to drink.

18:55.253 --> 18:57.627
Kinda didn't want to know.

18:57.627 --> 19:03.321
Can you think of anyone who might've
figured out what was going on with you?

19:03.321 --> 19:05.404
No.

19:05.404 --> 19:08.953
No. I mean, if they did,
they'd have told me, right?

19:08.953 --> 19:10.858
You suspect my client was framed?

19:10.858 --> 19:15.433
At this point, we're keeping
our minds open to every possibility.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.355
Who would do that to me?

19:17.355 --> 19:20.382
It's all right, Tommy.

19:20.382 --> 19:22.995
We're finished here?

19:27.489 --> 19:32.428
How sure are we that this isn't some
elaborate ruse by Officer Callahan?

19:32.428 --> 19:33.795
The doctors vouch for his condition.

19:33.795 --> 19:37.838
They think his shooting 
last year triggered it.

19:37.838 --> 19:40.280
There's no evidence he even
knew about his condition.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.171
He never sought treatment,
never took a sleeping pill.

19:44.171 --> 19:47.234
Could he have killed these
people while sleepwalking?

19:47.234 --> 19:49.445
Well, the murder was premeditated.

19:49.445 --> 19:55.884
From what we read, parasomniacs are
incapable of planning their behavior.

19:55.884 --> 19:58.999
They're hardly aware of their environment.

19:58.999 --> 20:04.492
They walk into traffic.
They... fall out of windows.

20:04.492 --> 20:07.924
So someone brought 
Officer Callahan downtown,

20:07.924 --> 20:10.684
used his gun to murder 
three people, and then

20:10.684 --> 20:15.747
left him to sleepwalk off
a deserted subway platform.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.997
That seems elaborate for a hate crime.

20:18.997 --> 20:21.611
But a hate crime is a good cover

20:21.611 --> 20:24.998
if only one of the victims
is the real target.

20:24.998 --> 20:29.796
You'd hit that target first to make sure 
you got him before hitting the decoys.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.946
Eddie Mercaldo was the first kill.

20:32.946 --> 20:34.764
Apartment Of Eduardo Mercaldo
551 West 111th Street, Monday, April 26

20:34.764 --> 20:39.558
No bills overdue. Checkbook's 
balanced. Solid citizen.

20:39.558 --> 20:42.562
And an organized one.

20:42.562 --> 20:44.730
Gig books.

20:45.653 --> 20:51.186
A record of every job he's
played all the way back to 1972.

20:51.186 --> 20:57.095
Who he played with, where...
and how much.

20:57.095 --> 20:59.531
Eddie's challenging my opinion of musicians.

20:59.531 --> 21:04.794
He prepaid his utilities
and rent three months at a time.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.440
He was probably on the road a lot.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.496
Didn't want to fall behind. Here.

21:09.496 --> 21:15.090
He played Caribbean cruises
four times in the last year.

21:15.090 --> 21:18.398
Cruise three months ago
stopped in the Cayman Islands.

21:18.398 --> 21:20.322
Cayman Islands.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.941
Seems like the one stop
all his cruises have in common.

21:22.941 --> 21:26.359
A lot of drugs go through the Caymans.
Eddie might've been a courier.

21:26.359 --> 21:30.119
We should get a dog to sniff his luggage.

21:38.399 --> 21:40.855
Brought the electric piano
on the cruise with him.

21:40.855 --> 21:45.244
You'd think that the ship
would have their own piano.

21:47.757 --> 21:50.810
You see? Something has been taken out.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.671
The old motherboard.

21:52.671 --> 21:55.862
He replaced it with smaller components
and made room for contraband.

21:55.862 --> 21:57.947
Enough for a couple bricks of coke.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.788
We'll see.

22:04.933 --> 22:09.158
Green tint on the lining. Mold?

22:10.612 --> 22:12.353
Ink.

22:13.872 --> 22:15.978
Green ink.

22:15.978 --> 22:19.388
The swab's negative for drugs.

22:20.806 --> 22:25.172
Humidity made the ink run.

22:25.172 --> 22:27.525
Cayman Islands. Offshore banks.
 (비거주자 간 거래 여건을 제공)

22:27.525 --> 22:31.271
Secret accounts, tax evasion.
Eddie was a money courier?

22:31.271 --> 22:33.826
Maybe he got greedy and started skimming.

22:33.826 --> 22:37.765
Whoever's money it is has to know Tommy.

22:37.765 --> 22:41.583
I didn't see any Fortune
500's in his address book.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.609
There is someone close to Tommy...

22:44.609 --> 22:48.734
who might know what a fortune looks like.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.513
Those Murano lamps.. .

22:50.513 --> 22:53.683
I knew they didn't look like knockoffs.

22:53.683 --> 22:55.931
Bergmann's Department Store
713 5th Avenue, Tuesday, April 27

22:55.931 --> 23:00.611
Three murders? It's inconceivable. I...

23:00.611 --> 23:03.064
Tommy was always very decent to me.

23:03.064 --> 23:06.538
We think his rage stems from
his shooting incident last year.

23:06.538 --> 23:08.746
Did he ever confide in you about that?

23:08.746 --> 23:11.240
Tommy doesn't confide.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.671
Things just tumble out.

23:14.671 --> 23:18.489
Last Christmas, he asked me
to light a candle for his mother,

23:18.489 --> 23:20.277
and that's how I found out
that his mother had died

23:20.277 --> 23:22.575
on Christmas Eve a few years earlier.

23:22.575 --> 23:28.992
And that's after knowing him,
what, three years.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.957
That's when you moved in next door, isn't it?

23:30.957 --> 23:33.145
I don't remember telling you that.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.148
We looked it up in your rental application.

23:35.148 --> 23:38.195
We try to find out as much as
possible about potential witnesses.

23:38.195 --> 23:41.575
Like your job history.
It's sort of sketchy.

23:41.575 --> 23:43.518
You've only worked here for four years...

23:43.518 --> 23:47.763
and already you're a personal
shopper in the couture department.

23:47.763 --> 23:49.935
You have a lot of retail experience?

23:49.935 --> 23:52.346
Why don't you look it up?

23:52.346 --> 23:56.857
We tried, but your Social Security
number only goes back five years.

23:56.857 --> 23:59.414
- You changed it.
- I had to.

23:59.414 --> 24:01.340
Someone stole my identity.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.590
Now, since this interview 
is not about Tommy,

24:04.590 --> 24:08.218
I really do have to get back to work.

24:08.218 --> 24:11.262
You're tough, Ms. Landau.

24:11.262 --> 24:13.964
You don't let people push you around.

24:13.964 --> 24:16.842
I've had to learn not to.

24:18.275 --> 24:22.195
Her outfit... looks like one of those 
overpriced French designers,

24:22.195 --> 24:24.443
at least eight or nine years old.

24:24.443 --> 24:26.591
She probably bought it back in her other life,

24:26.591 --> 24:30.171
the one she doesn't want us to know about.

24:30.171 --> 24:33.238
The money Eddie was carrying to the Caymans...

24:33.238 --> 24:36.796
probably used to be hers.

24:36.796 --> 24:39.190
Before she started using 
the name Beth Landau,

24:39.190 --> 24:42.737
she was known as Elizabeth Post,
with an address off Fifth Avenue.

24:42.737 --> 24:45.841
I got her.
Post v. Post.

24:45.841 --> 24:48.845
It's a divorce action.
Started seven years ago.

24:48.845 --> 24:50.587
Started? They're still married?

24:50.587 --> 24:54.355
Apparently so. No kids.
Dozens of motions,

24:54.355 --> 24:56.239
mostly about finances.

24:56.239 --> 24:58.890
That's what this money is...
contested finances.

24:58.890 --> 25:01.079
See if you can locate the husband.

25:01.079 --> 25:07.202
Shouldn't be too hard. He's been
at the same address for the last six years.

25:07.202 --> 25:09.286
Lake George Minimum Security Prison
Lake George, New York, Friday, April 30

25:09.286 --> 25:13.888
I'm sorry you came all the way up here,
but I've never heard of Eddie Mercaldo.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.871
Are you sure about that?
Because he was smuggling money,

25:16.871 --> 25:18.675
and you're hiding assets.

25:18.675 --> 25:20.454
We thought there was a natural connection.

25:20.454 --> 25:23.073
I am not hiding assets.

25:23.073 --> 25:28.847
No? Because the judge said so
when she put you in jail for contempt.

25:28.847 --> 25:31.197
Let me see.

25:32.266 --> 25:34.108
Bing! Right here.

25:34.108 --> 25:38.927
"For refusing to disclose the location of
marital assets totaling more than $15 million."

25:38.927 --> 25:42.113
All that money's in an offshore bank.
Eddie was making regular runs,

25:42.113 --> 25:45.738
bringing back cash to pay your legal bills,
take care of other business.

25:45.738 --> 25:46.667
No, no.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.833
Your wife found out.
She cut off your pipeline.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.802
She had Eddie shot.

25:50.802 --> 25:54.719
Don't be absurd. Elizabeth went 
to Holyoke, for God's sake.

25:54.719 --> 26:01.479
Believe me, if that money still existed,
Elizabeth's lawyers would've unearthed it by now.

26:04.882 --> 26:10.062
You know, you've been
in jail for contempt of court...

26:10.062 --> 26:13.151
longer than anyone 
in the history of New York.

26:13.151 --> 26:15.990
I'm well aware of the 
Kafkaesque journey I'm on.

26:15.990 --> 26:19.122
Well, the journey that your wife put you on.

26:19.122 --> 26:24.279
Now, I'd think that you'd jump at 
the chance to implicate her in a murder.

26:24.279 --> 26:29.175
She doesn't have the wherewithal
for this sort of violent...

26:29.175 --> 26:32.461
calculation.

26:32.461 --> 26:35.789
Oh. It's time for my shift in the mail room.

26:35.789 --> 26:38.529
Thirty-eight cents an hour.

26:38.529 --> 26:44.331
Don't tell Elizabeth's lawyers.
They'll move to garnish.

26:44.331 --> 26:47.586
Implicating her would mean revealing
where he hid the money.

26:49.266 --> 26:53.042
She's his wife.
She's still entitled to half.

26:53.042 --> 26:57.023
He'd rather see her walk on three counts
of murder than split it with her.

26:57.023 --> 27:01.002
Ain't love grand?

27:02.721 --> 27:04.153
Rubber Soul.
 (비틀스의 1965년 발매 앨범 제목)

27:04.153 --> 27:06.141
It was a cover band.

27:06.141 --> 27:08.585
They toured colleges back in the '70s.

27:08.585 --> 27:12.495
Eddie on piano, and that's 
Bingham Post on drums.

27:12.495 --> 27:15.297
- And they kept in touch all these years?
- There's no evidence of that.

27:15.297 --> 27:18.240
We checked Eddie's old phone
records and address books.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.635
No Bingham.

27:19.635 --> 27:21.968
Which made Eddie a perfect bagman.

27:21.968 --> 27:23.750
He wasn't on anyone's radar.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.755
A guy he hadn't seen for over 30 years,

27:26.755 --> 27:29.699
and he got him to agree to break
I don't know how many laws?

27:29.699 --> 27:33.431
They bonded for life on the road.

27:33.431 --> 27:36.679
I was in a singing group in college.

27:36.679 --> 27:39.440
Twenty years later,
any of those guys call,

27:39.440 --> 27:42.165
we pick up where we left off.

27:43.827 --> 27:48.197
Ms. Landau would've needed a private
investigator to find Mr. Mercaldo.

27:48.197 --> 27:52.382
Even if she could afford it,
there's no record she paid for one.

27:52.382 --> 27:56.973
She was very good at mothering Tommy.

27:56.973 --> 28:02.415
Maybe his shirts weren't
the only ones she was ironing.

28:02.415 --> 28:04.072
Beth never mentioned other cops.

28:04.072 --> 28:07.068
You guys can't be right about her.
She's a classy lady.

28:07.068 --> 28:08.268
She was interested in you.

28:08.268 --> 28:11.146
She was worried about your health.

28:11.146 --> 28:13.509
She noticed how tired you were.

28:13.509 --> 28:15.067
I asked her what she knew 
about sleeping pills.

28:15.067 --> 28:17.133
She said they were bad for you.

28:17.133 --> 28:20.522
Well, the right sleeping pill
will keep you in bed, Tommy,

28:20.522 --> 28:27.571
instead of pacing in your room...
or wandering the streets.

28:27.571 --> 28:30.861
- She knew your condition.
- No! Wrong.

28:30.861 --> 28:34.243
You don't think she heard you banging
on the wall, talking to yourself?

28:34.243 --> 28:40.036
Beth didn't want to tell you because 
she liked you the way you were.

28:53.042 --> 28:55.861
She must've known.

28:55.861 --> 28:58.693
She ever ask you any favors,
you know?

28:58.693 --> 29:02.734
Like running down a license plate
or finding an address?

29:02.734 --> 29:06.836
Nah. The only thing I ever helped
her with was renting a car.

29:06.836 --> 29:10.063
Her credit was bad.
She needed something cheap, for cash.

29:10.063 --> 29:12.680
She say what she needed it for?

29:12.680 --> 29:14.966
Overnight visits to her sister.

29:14.966 --> 29:17.176
Do you know exactly where she went?

29:17.176 --> 29:22.052
Because, uh,
she doesn't have a sister.

29:24.585 --> 29:29.281
I don't know. Just overnight.

29:29.281 --> 29:30.879
She did call me one time.

29:30.879 --> 29:33.708
She couldn't get her car started.
It was late.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.305
And where'd you pick her up?

29:35.305 --> 29:39.326
Just over the Willis Avenue Bridge in the Bronx.

29:39.326 --> 29:43.565
Nothing there but warehouses.

29:43.565 --> 29:46.776
And storage facilities.

29:46.776 --> 29:50.212
B & C Storage, Bronx, New York
Tuesday, May 4

29:50.212 --> 29:54.015
Beth in her former life looks 
happy and prosperous.

29:55.165 --> 29:59.807
Wigs. Blonde, redhead.

30:07.956 --> 30:10.973
No prescription.
Disguises?

30:10.973 --> 30:16.167
Adult diapers.
What is she disguising herself as?

30:16.167 --> 30:21.029
- Flashlights. Energy bars.
- Maps.

30:21.029 --> 30:24.766
- High-speed film.
- Binoculars.

30:24.766 --> 30:30.344
Stakeout. That's why she needed
to get a rental car.

30:30.344 --> 30:32.757
She didn't hire a P.I.

30:32.757 --> 30:36.119
She turned herself into one.

30:36.119 --> 30:38.175
.22 auto.

30:40.592 --> 30:43.183
Membership card to a gun club in Hoboken.

30:43.183 --> 30:48.003
She turned herself into 
Wild Bill Hickok too.

30:48.003 --> 30:51.354
Bingham Post filed a new application for release.

30:51.354 --> 30:59.329
Included was a copy of a letter
Mr. Post sent his wife earlier this week.

30:59.329 --> 31:02.696
"Dear Elizabeth, This war
has gone on for too long

31:02.696 --> 31:04.791
and benefited neither of us. 
I wronged you,

31:04.791 --> 31:08.303
and I want the chance to make amends.

31:08.303 --> 31:12.714
I hope someday we'll even
be able to dance to our old song."

31:12.714 --> 31:14.436
I'm feeling nauseous.

31:14.436 --> 31:16.973
It apparently worked its
charms on Ms. Landau.

31:16.973 --> 31:21.018
She indicated to the judge
she won't oppose her husband's release.

31:21.018 --> 31:25.959
Well, maybe because she can't
access the money without him.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.386
And if he's willing to split it with her,

31:29.386 --> 31:32.821
it means that he can't get
at it without her help.

31:32.821 --> 31:35.205
She has something he needs...
the bank account numbers,

31:35.205 --> 31:39.371
a password, something she took
from Eddie the night she killed him.

31:41.030 --> 31:44.034
He, uh...

31:44.034 --> 31:47.678
His address book was still on him.
His wallet, house keys.

31:47.678 --> 31:51.147
No sheet music.

31:51.147 --> 31:54.395
Would he bring sheet music
for his gig at the piano bar?

31:54.395 --> 31:57.645
Not sheet music,
but he'd have a fake book.

31:57.645 --> 32:01.044
A list of songs with
their keys and start notes...

32:01.044 --> 32:03.946
to fake his way through any request.

32:03.946 --> 32:05.890
He wouldn't go anywhere without it.

32:05.890 --> 32:08.019
That bank information
could've been in that book.

32:08.019 --> 32:11.613
And now Beth's dangling it
in front of her husband.

32:11.613 --> 32:17.593
You know, I think we need to be there
for Bingham and Beth's reconciliation.

32:18.598 --> 32:24.295
Any way to get him released
into the custody of his wife?

32:24.295 --> 32:27.216
I'll talk to the judge.

32:27.216 --> 32:29.850
Good to see you again.

32:29.850 --> 32:32.019
May I?

32:37.243 --> 32:39.820
There. Not so bad, was it?

32:39.820 --> 32:42.848
You still like irises, I hope.

32:42.848 --> 32:46.891
Yes, I still like irises.

32:46.891 --> 32:50.007
I'll put them in water.

32:50.007 --> 32:52.461
I recognize the lamps.

32:52.461 --> 32:56.423
One of the few things you didn't
take when you walked out.

32:56.423 --> 32:58.084
Now, come on.

32:58.084 --> 33:00.630
I learned my lesson.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.703
Have you?

33:02.703 --> 33:05.926
Ah! Why don't I pour us a glass?

33:05.926 --> 33:08.644
No. Not now.

33:08.644 --> 33:10.080
It's for later.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.268
By the way, did you smell
the stairwell on your way up?

33:13.268 --> 33:14.967
I got used to that smell in prison.

33:14.967 --> 33:17.646
You could've walked out anytime.

33:17.646 --> 33:20.016
You stayed in for spite.

33:20.016 --> 33:22.338
- I did not choose this.
- You're right.

33:22.338 --> 33:26.833
How well do you think you'd do
with no resources, no credit,

33:26.833 --> 33:30.960
past your prime with 
no marketable skills?

33:30.960 --> 33:34.125
That's all in the past.

33:34.125 --> 33:35.705
Now we need each other.

33:35.705 --> 33:38.830
Oh, I don't need anything from you.

33:38.830 --> 33:43.450
I can get by on my own.
But... you need me.

33:43.450 --> 33:46.192
Yes, I do. You have something I want.

33:46.192 --> 33:49.480
What could I possibly have that you'd want?

33:49.480 --> 33:51.363
Isn't that what you said when you left?

33:51.363 --> 33:53.647
I was wrong.
What I wrote in that letter,

33:53.647 --> 33:57.470
I meant it. I hope that someday
we could be like we once were.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.474
The bridges to the past have been burned.

33:59.474 --> 34:01.215
There's nothing left. Nothing.

34:01.215 --> 34:05.232
She played him.
She won't give it up.

34:06.261 --> 34:10.094
I spent six years in jail, but you won.

34:10.094 --> 34:11.753
You expecting someone?

34:11.753 --> 34:13.802
Ms. Landau,
it's Detectives Goren and Eames.

34:13.802 --> 34:16.400
Can we speak with you?

34:18.344 --> 34:20.311
We're sorry to bother you.

34:20.311 --> 34:22.326
We heard your husband was 
being released today.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.799
We wanted to make sure you were okay.

34:24.799 --> 34:28.210
Speak of the devil. 
Look who's here.

34:28.974 --> 34:31.759
Is he harassing you?
Did he invite himself in?

34:31.759 --> 34:36.359
No. We decided it was 
time to end the war.

34:36.359 --> 34:38.402
And share the spoils.

34:38.402 --> 34:40.514
You're gonna tell her
where you hid your money?

34:40.514 --> 34:44.946
Elizabeth understands now
there is no hidden money.

34:44.946 --> 34:47.498
I'm here to talk about reconciling.

34:47.498 --> 34:49.668
Reconcile?

34:49.668 --> 34:52.166
No, he's here to gloat.

34:52.166 --> 34:56.596
He wants to get a look at
your little rabbit hutch here.

34:56.596 --> 34:59.338
I bet your dressing room on Fifth Avenue
was bigger than this whole place.

34:59.338 --> 35:02.137
Neither one of us has had it easy
in the last few years.

35:02.137 --> 35:05.774
Beth had nothing. You stuck her 
with so much bad paper...

35:05.774 --> 35:12.017
that she couldn't even start fresh
without a new identity, isn't that right?

35:12.017 --> 35:15.185
I... I couldn't buy a cup of coffee
on credit, thanks to him.

35:15.185 --> 35:18.273
I wasn't myself then. I was cruel.

35:18.273 --> 35:19.504
I don't know what I was thinking.

35:19.504 --> 35:22.697
Do you think that he appreciates
your dire circumstances,

35:22.697 --> 35:24.225
the humiliation that he put you through?

35:24.225 --> 35:26.124
I doubt it.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.680
Empathy was never his strong suit.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.976
Elizabeth, that was then.

35:30.976 --> 35:34.425
You know, you really should've had
him come down to the department store.

35:34.425 --> 35:39.081
He would've gotten a kick watching you
schlepp those dresses back and forth.

35:39.081 --> 35:42.685
It was the only job she could get,
being a woman her age.

35:42.685 --> 35:46.037
I don't know how you got through each day.

35:46.037 --> 35:50.426
It must have been the thought
of making Bingham pay...

35:50.426 --> 35:54.594
and pay and pay.

35:57.558 --> 36:01.422
That's a nice vintage.

36:07.893 --> 36:12.342
But I guess those days are almost over.

36:17.674 --> 36:21.783
I guess that it's time to...

36:22.823 --> 36:27.401
make a toast to new beginnings.

36:27.401 --> 36:30.262
You're splitting 15 mil.

36:30.262 --> 36:33.146
For the last time,
there isn't any money.

36:33.146 --> 36:37.479
No, see, there is.
And Eddie was your courier.

36:37.479 --> 36:41.053
We verified he had a notebook
on him the night he was killed.

36:41.053 --> 36:44.116
A fake book, a cheat sheet for hundreds of songs.

36:44.116 --> 36:45.248
I know what a fake book is.

36:45.248 --> 36:47.438
Why?

36:47.438 --> 36:49.754
Did Eddie have one when
you played in a band with him?

36:49.754 --> 36:53.020
We think that's where he kept
the information on the bank in the Caymans...

36:53.020 --> 36:56.217
the account numbers, the passwords.

36:56.217 --> 36:59.344
Eddie's book was missing when we found him.

37:02.199 --> 37:06.143
Is this what you were planning on serving him?

37:06.143 --> 37:10.085
We know Beth's lawyers never found
any offshore accounts in your name,

37:10.085 --> 37:13.779
so it's probably in Eddie's name.

37:14.790 --> 37:20.522
And you can't access the money...

37:20.522 --> 37:26.696
without the information... in that book.

37:29.905 --> 37:32.256
Say when.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.240
Spiral notebook, huh, Beth?

37:45.240 --> 37:47.469
You burned it?

37:47.469 --> 37:49.333
What did you do?

37:49.333 --> 37:53.152
It's a joke, right?
Tell me you copied the information.

37:54.710 --> 37:59.035
Beth, stop screwing around!
Tell me you copied it!

38:01.321 --> 38:05.799
She didn't. She doesn't care 
about the money anymore.

38:05.799 --> 38:08.065
She made a new life for herself.

38:08.065 --> 38:10.274
You're the only one that's
petrified about not having it.

38:10.274 --> 38:12.030
We have no way of getting that money now!

38:12.030 --> 38:14.718
Don't you understand?

38:14.718 --> 38:16.332
I think she gets it.

38:16.332 --> 38:19.930
She's come a long way from Holyoke.

38:20.873 --> 38:25.694
You know, they say that this
should be served at room temperature.

38:25.694 --> 38:31.112
But it's best served cold, revenge.

38:32.609 --> 38:37.367
Look at his face.

38:37.367 --> 38:39.303
Isn't that enough shock, enough

38:39.303 --> 38:43.347
devastation to make it worth your while?

38:43.347 --> 38:44.368
I didn't do anything.

38:44.368 --> 38:48.791
Didn't do anything?
You burned $15 million.

38:48.791 --> 38:50.389
That's all the money I had.

38:50.389 --> 38:54.927
You want him to grovel at your feet?
Would that satisfy you?

38:54.927 --> 39:00.529
You know, satisfy your...
your wounded heart?

39:05.266 --> 39:09.333
Oh, you're feeling it, aren't you?

39:09.333 --> 39:11.608
The emptiness of it.

39:11.608 --> 39:13.898
Revenge. You know, the whole buildup,

39:13.898 --> 39:15.445
and then it lets you down, doesn't it?

39:15.445 --> 39:17.088
Considering all the hours,

39:17.088 --> 39:21.681
the long nights spent stalking
Bing's lawyers and friends,

39:21.681 --> 39:25.672
staking out Eddie's piano bar,
finding the other victims.

39:25.672 --> 39:27.777
I didn't do that.

39:27.777 --> 39:32.579
Wearing wigs and phony glasses
and living off energy bars.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.640
We found your bat cave.

39:36.772 --> 39:40.529
It's very impressive.

39:40.529 --> 39:45.081
This item, especially. Diapers.

39:45.081 --> 39:49.311
Couldn't leave your post without
running the risk of missing something,

39:49.311 --> 39:53.229
so you sat there for hours
in the clammy wetness,

39:53.229 --> 39:59.718
sustained by the thought of Bingham
squirming at the end of your hook.

40:01.011 --> 40:06.098
You know, I bet that this Beth...

40:06.098 --> 40:10.386
would never think she was capable of that.

40:11.415 --> 40:14.930
I had to... look out for myself.

40:14.930 --> 40:19.236
Or hitting bull's-eyes
at the gun club, week after week.

40:19.236 --> 40:21.509
Or what you did to the neighbor.

40:21.509 --> 40:26.797
You know, all that mothering.
That took real ice in your veins.

40:28.946 --> 40:35.216
I'm... I'm... I'm not that kind of person.

40:36.285 --> 40:40.409
Beth is not that kind of person.

40:42.252 --> 40:45.521
But you?

40:49.444 --> 40:52.551
You knew that Tommy was sick.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.637
And instead of getting him help,

40:54.637 --> 40:58.133
you made sure his shirts were
starched and his belly was full...

40:58.133 --> 41:02.646
until that night when you drove him downtown,

41:02.646 --> 41:04.549
killed three people.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.025
You used his gun.

41:06.025 --> 41:07.846
You let him loose in the subway.

41:07.846 --> 41:10.465
And so what if a train hit him?

41:10.465 --> 41:12.779
Didn't matter,
because you didn't care.

41:12.779 --> 41:15.438
I'm not like that! I would care!

41:15.438 --> 41:18.583
Oh, you care now?
You care about these three men?

41:18.583 --> 41:23.196
You care about them?
And the lives that you consumed?

41:23.617 --> 41:26.293
And your own life.

41:26.293 --> 41:29.780
- Oh, God.
- Do you see now?

41:29.780 --> 41:34.847
Come on, Beth.
Come on. Look at this.

41:34.847 --> 41:38.511
Beth, look at her.

41:38.511 --> 41:40.762
Come on. Let me know that this woman...

41:40.762 --> 41:45.088
Let me know if this decent woman...

41:46.456 --> 41:50.642
isn't dead.

41:50.642 --> 41:53.829
What would she tell me?

41:53.829 --> 41:56.337
What does she need to tell me?

41:58.383 --> 42:01.328
Oh, God.

42:03.028 --> 42:05.574
I... I killed them.

42:12.910 --> 42:16.023
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

42:16.023 --> 42:19.052
You're under arrest, Beth.

42:22.404 --> 42:26.161
God, I don't know what became of me.

42:30.103 --> 42:31.868
Look.

42:31.868 --> 42:36.417
Look what you've turned me into!

42:37.305 --> 42:41.018
You did this to me! You! You!

42:43.410 --> 42:46.964
You're gonna have to come
downtown to make a statement.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.349
I don't recognize her.

42:50.349 --> 42:52.658
That's not the woman I married.

42:52.658 --> 42:54.032
Well, then you're even.

42:54.032 --> 42:58.015
I can't imagine you're
the man she married either.

43:04.750 --> 43:09.631
So that's what 15 million bucks looks like.

43:10.533 --> 43:14.193
So that's what vengeance gets you...

43:14.193 --> 43:17.195
A mouthful of ashes.

43:18.055 --> 43:20.553
