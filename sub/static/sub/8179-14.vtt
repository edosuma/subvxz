WEBVTT

00:04.553 --> 00:07.355
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE SCISSORS ARE?

00:10.793 --> 00:16.331
DOUG, WE HAVE LIVED IN
THIS HOUSE FOR 9 YEARS, OK?

00:16.399 --> 00:19.700
THE SCISSORS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN IN THE SAME PLACE,

00:19.768 --> 00:24.172
AND YET YOU CONTINUE TO
ASK ME WHERE THEY ARE.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.707
NOT TO MENTION
THE SPATULA,

00:26.775 --> 00:29.094
THE POT HOLDERS,
THE PENS.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.595
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, HONEY.

00:30.663 --> 00:34.515
I HAVE BEEN A TOUR GUIDE IN
MY OWN KITCHEN LONG ENOUGH.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.385
TOO MANY PRECIOUS
MOMENTS HAVE BEEN WASTED

00:37.453 --> 00:38.869
SHOWING YOU
WHERE THINGS ARE!

00:38.937 --> 00:41.306
JUST LEARN! LEARN!

00:41.373 --> 00:43.040
I MEAN,
WHAT IF I DIED?

00:43.108 --> 00:45.009
HOW WOULD YOU
FLIP A PANCAKE?

00:45.077 --> 00:48.045
HOW WOULD YOU
- HOW WOULD YOU EVER CUT ANYTHING EVER AGAIN?

00:48.113 --> 00:50.715
WOULD YOU
JUST SIT HERE WEEPING

00:50.782 --> 00:54.051
AND SOILING YOURSELF UNTIL
SOMEBODY CAME IN TO HELP YOU?

00:54.119 --> 00:56.053
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.
YOU WOULD...

00:56.121 --> 00:59.741
REMEMBER
WHERE SOMETHING IS.

00:59.808 --> 01:01.776
YEAH. SO COME ON,
HONEY. PLEASE.

01:01.844 --> 01:02.944
JUST THIS ONCE.

01:03.012 --> 01:04.613
FIND WHERE
THE SCISSORS ARE.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.081
FIND 'EM.
GO AHEAD, BABY.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.482
GO GET 'EM.

01:08.550 --> 01:10.568
GO AHEAD.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.429 --> 01:23.615
I GOT 'EM.
YOU GOT 'EM.

01:24.883 --> 01:27.017
YOU GOT 'EM.
NOW, WAS THAT SO HARD?

01:27.085 --> 01:28.270
NOT REALLY, NO.
OK.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.527
WHAT DO YOU NEED NOW?

01:36.595 --> 01:39.430
TAPE.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.819
WELL, HEY, MAJOR,
WHATCHA GOT THERE?

02:17.887 --> 02:20.539
I MADE YOU A VALENTINE,
AUNT CARRIE.

02:20.606 --> 02:22.974
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET...

02:23.042 --> 02:25.910
AND OUT OF MY JURY SUMMONS.

02:25.978 --> 02:29.247
OK. I WILL PUT IT
RIGHT HERE

02:29.315 --> 02:34.018
NEXT TO MY SNOWFLAKE
MORTGAGE PAYMENT.

02:34.086 --> 02:35.453
WHAT'S THAT?

02:35.521 --> 02:37.288
THIS IS COFFEE, BABY.

02:37.356 --> 02:39.257
I WANT SOME.
COFFEE! COFFEE!

02:39.325 --> 02:41.126
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, BABY.

02:41.193 --> 02:42.693
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS A GROWN-UP DRINK,

02:42.761 --> 02:44.029
JUST LIKE THE BIG VODKA
I'M GONNA HAVE

02:44.096 --> 02:46.731
AFTER YOUR PARENTS
PICK YOU UP.

02:50.152 --> 02:53.855
DOUG. HE HAS
MY LIPSTICK AGAIN.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.606
I TOLD YOU
TO HIDE THOSE.

02:55.674 --> 02:59.344
I DO,
BUT HE FINDS THEM.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.847
HEY, WHATCHA-WHATCHA
GOT THERE, KIRB?

03:02.915 --> 03:05.950
APRICOT SHIMMER.

03:06.017 --> 03:08.069
OK.

03:08.136 --> 03:09.354
DO YOU THINK IT'S PRETTY?

03:09.422 --> 03:10.605
I THINK IT'S, UH,

03:10.673 --> 03:12.524
PRETTY GREAT
AS A MISSILE

03:12.591 --> 03:13.791
ON OUR BATTLESHIP.

03:13.859 --> 03:14.776
LOOK AT THAT. FIRE ONE!

03:17.379 --> 03:19.297
BLOOD, GUTS, DEATH.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.366
MAN THINGS.

03:22.718 --> 03:24.369
HEY, Y'ALL.
HEY.

03:24.437 --> 03:25.670
BOYS BEHAVE THEMSELVES?

03:25.737 --> 03:26.588
OH, YEAH.
THEY WERE FINE.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.173
BUBBLEGUM WENT RIGHT
INTO THE CARPET.

03:28.190 --> 03:30.374
ANYWAY, IT'S OK.

03:30.442 --> 03:33.345
HE DIDN'T TRY TO PUT ON
LIPSTICK AGAIN, DID HE?

03:33.412 --> 03:36.864
IN HIS DEFENSE,
IT IS PRETTY.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.517
LISTEN, WE REALLY APPRECIATE

03:39.585 --> 03:41.336
YOU GUYS TAKING THE BOYS AGAIN.

03:41.403 --> 03:42.337
YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU.

03:42.404 --> 03:43.471
HAVING SOME ALONE TIME
ONCE A WEEK

03:43.539 --> 03:45.506
HAS BEEN HUGE FOR ME
AND KEL.

03:45.574 --> 03:46.691
OH, PLEASE. WE'RE
HAPPY TO HELP OUT.

03:46.758 --> 03:47.792
YEAH, PLUS,
ONCE A WEEK,

03:47.860 --> 03:48.943
WE GET TO BE
THE KIND OF FAMILY

03:49.011 --> 03:52.096
THAT YOU USUALLY
ONLY SEE ON TV.

03:52.164 --> 03:54.148
DO THAT THING
I TAUGHT YOU.

03:54.216 --> 03:57.051
WHAT YOU TALKING
ABOUT, DOUGLAS?

03:57.119 --> 03:58.669
THE KID'S A MACHINE.

03:58.737 --> 04:01.138
WE REALLY OWE YOU GUYS.
YEAH.

04:01.206 --> 04:03.591
DARLING, I NEED TO BORROW
SOME BRONZING CREAM,

04:03.659 --> 04:07.295
AN OVERNIGHT BAG,
AND A MAJOR CREDIT CARD.

04:08.513 --> 04:09.814
WHAT FOR, DAD?

04:09.881 --> 04:13.284
THAT'S MY PERSONAL
BUSINESS!

04:14.486 --> 04:16.286
OK. YOU WANT
TO HELP US OUT?

04:16.355 --> 04:18.755
TAKE THAT GUY OFF OUR
HANDS ONCE IN A WHILE.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.858
GOT TO THROW YOU
A BIG FAT "NO" ON THAT ONE.

04:21.927 --> 04:24.129
THANKS AGAIN, YOU GUYS.

04:24.196 --> 04:26.197
BYE!

04:26.265 --> 04:28.533
NIGHT.
BYE-BYE.

04:38.393 --> 04:40.195
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:40.262 --> 04:42.363
APPARENTLY, SOMEBODY DIDN'T
LIKE HIS MACARONI AND CHEESE,

04:42.431 --> 04:44.332
SO HE HID IT
IN THE CHANGE JAR.

04:46.101 --> 04:47.919
ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT WAS YOUR
DAD. I SAW HIM IN THAT AREA.

04:47.986 --> 04:50.120
OY.

04:50.188 --> 04:51.956
UH, SPEAKING OF YOUR DAD,

04:52.023 --> 04:54.625
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU
SAID BEFORE TO DEACON AND KELLY.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.193
WHAT?

04:56.261 --> 05:00.264
THAT THING ABOUT MAYBE THEM TAKING
HIM OFF OUR HANDS ONCE IN A WHILE.

05:00.332 --> 05:01.499
I WAS KIDDING.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.233
I KNOW YOU WERE
KIDDING, BUT...

05:03.301 --> 05:04.469
THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A SECOND.

05:04.536 --> 05:06.804
I MEAN, WE WATCH KIRBY
AND MAJOR ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

05:06.872 --> 05:07.972
THEY'RE CHILDREN.

05:08.039 --> 05:09.440
SO? WE DON'T
HAVE ANY CHILDREN.

05:09.508 --> 05:13.143
WE HAVE A CRAZY OLD MAN.

05:13.211 --> 05:14.845
I MEAN, WHY DOES SOCIETY

05:14.913 --> 05:17.114
SAY THAT BABY-SITTING
IS NORMAL,

05:17.183 --> 05:20.385
BUT OLD-PEOPLE-SITTING,
THAT'S TABOO?

05:20.452 --> 05:22.202
HUH.

05:22.270 --> 05:23.203
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

05:23.271 --> 05:24.939
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
THAT WAY BEFORE,

05:25.006 --> 05:27.875
BUT YOU MAY BE ON TO
SOMETHING HERE, BUTCH.

05:27.943 --> 05:29.610
THANK YOU.

05:29.678 --> 05:33.281
I MEAN, HOW DIFFERENT IS MY
FATHER FROM A CHILD, ANYWAY?

05:33.348 --> 05:34.716
I MEAN, HE ACTS OUT.

05:34.783 --> 05:36.718
HE SCREAMS WHEN
HE DOESN'T GET HIS WAY.

05:36.785 --> 05:39.437
WHEN IT THUNDERS,
HE CLIMBS INTO BED WITH US.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.538
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

05:40.605 --> 05:42.273
WE DESERVE
SOME ALONE TIME

05:42.341 --> 05:44.542
JUST AS MUCH
AS DEACON AND KELLY.

05:44.609 --> 05:46.277
OUR MARRIAGE
ISN'T PERFECT, EITHER.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.680
FAR FROM IT.

05:48.748 --> 05:49.947
I MEAN, SOMETIMES I WAKE UP

05:50.015 --> 05:51.983
AND I JUST WANNA
RUN AWAY FROM YOU.

05:53.602 --> 05:56.270
I FEEL
THE SAME WAY!

05:56.338 --> 05:58.923
OF COURSE YOU DO!

05:58.991 --> 05:59.824
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

05:59.975 --> 06:01.642
US BABY-SITTING
MAJOR AND KIRBY.

06:01.710 --> 06:02.944
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE OTHER THINGS?

06:03.011 --> 06:04.395
THE-THE BIRTHDAY PARTIES

06:04.463 --> 06:07.114
AND ALL THE SCHOOL PLAYS
WE HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH.

06:07.182 --> 06:07.949
MEANWHILE,
HAVE DEACON AND KELLY

06:08.066 --> 06:10.368
EVER BEEN TO ONE
OF ARTHUR'S THINGS?

06:10.436 --> 06:11.286
NO!

06:11.437 --> 06:13.471
WHEN HE GOT
HIS SWIMMING CERTIFICATE-

06:13.539 --> 06:16.508
<i>AND HOW ABOUT WHEN HE WAS IN THAT
SENIOR CENTER PRODUCTION OF CATS?</i>

06:16.575 --> 06:19.076
WHERE WERE THEY?
TOO BUSY.

06:19.144 --> 06:21.412
OOH, THAT WAS ROUGH.

06:21.479 --> 06:25.382
<i>REMEMBER WHEN THAT ONE CAT
BROKE HER HIP DURING MEMORIES?</i>

06:25.450 --> 06:30.472
OK. THE POINT IS
WE PRESENT DEACON AND KELLY

06:30.539 --> 06:33.942
WITH A VERY REASONABLE REQUEST,
AND WHAT DO WE GET BACK?

06:34.009 --> 06:37.211
GOTTA THROW YOU A BIG
FAT "NO" ON THAT ONE.

06:37.279 --> 06:38.496
YEAH! I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.798
THIS IS HAPPENING,
FRIEND.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.499
OH, I KNOW
IT'S HAPPENING.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.136
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
IT'S HAPPENING, FRIEND!

06:45.203 --> 06:48.206
WE'RE NOT MAD AT
EACH OTHER HERE, RIGHT?

06:48.273 --> 06:49.390
NO.
GOOD.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.509
'CAUSE I GOT A LITTLE
LOST THERE FOR A SECOND.

06:57.232 --> 06:58.866
OK. THEY
JUST PULLED UP.

06:58.934 --> 07:00.118
OK. IT'S SHOWTIME.

07:00.185 --> 07:02.186
DAD? COULD YOU COME
UP HERE FOR A MINUTE?

07:02.254 --> 07:04.122
ALL RIGHT, KIDS. COME
ON. PARENTS ARE HERE.

07:04.189 --> 07:06.641
DOUG, HELP THEM GET PACKED
UP. OK. YOU KNOW WHAT, KIRB?

07:06.708 --> 07:11.345
WHY DON'T YOU GET G.I. JOE OUT OF
THAT BLOUSE AND BACK INTO HIS KHAKIS?

07:11.413 --> 07:12.997
TIME FOR DINNER?

07:13.064 --> 07:14.131
UH, NOT EXACTLY.

07:14.199 --> 07:16.467
IT'S JUST YOU HAVEN'T
FED ME SINCE BREAKFAST,

07:16.534 --> 07:19.336
AND I'M STARTING TO HEAR
A LOW-PITCHED HUM.

07:19.404 --> 07:21.388
YOU WILL BE EATING
IN NO TIME.

07:24.376 --> 07:27.078
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

07:27.146 --> 07:27.929
HOW WAS
YOUR AFTERNOON?

07:27.996 --> 07:29.347
YOU GET SOME
GOOD ALONE TIME IN?

07:29.414 --> 07:30.381
IT WAS GREAT. WE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY

07:30.449 --> 07:31.982
AT THE MODERN
MUSEUM OF ART.

07:32.050 --> 07:34.269
OUCH.

07:34.336 --> 07:36.170
SO, UH, WHERE
YOU HEADED NOW?

07:36.238 --> 07:38.355
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE KIDS
TO THIS NEW ITALIAN PLACE.

07:38.423 --> 07:41.008
OH, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
RIGHT. KIRBY MENTIONED THAT.

07:41.076 --> 07:42.209
YOU KNOW
WHO LOVES ITALIAN FOOD?

07:42.277 --> 07:44.245
ARTHUR, YOU LOVE
ITALIAN FOOD, DON'T YOU?

07:44.312 --> 07:45.830
I'D EAT ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT.

07:45.897 --> 07:49.166
JUST END
THIS EXPERIMENT.

07:49.234 --> 07:50.884
HEY! CRAZY IDEA.

07:50.952 --> 07:52.470
YOU LOVE
ITALIAN FOOD.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.472
YOU'RE GOING TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.874
MAYBE DEACON AND KELLY
CAN GIVE YOU A LIFT.

07:56.942 --> 07:58.626
HECK.
WHILE YOU'RE THERE,

07:58.694 --> 07:59.994
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
JUST SIT TOGETHER,

08:00.061 --> 08:01.696
OK? WOULD YA,
COULD YA?

08:07.986 --> 08:10.555
WHAT-
WHAT CAN I SAY?

08:10.622 --> 08:12.173
SOUNDS LIKE
A THUMBS UP TO ME.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.308
OK. WELL,
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

08:14.376 --> 08:15.743
HERE YOU GO. GLAD THIS WORKED OUT.

08:15.810 --> 08:17.745
GO ON, DAD.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

08:17.812 --> 08:19.980
GO AHEAD.
SKEDOODLE.

08:20.048 --> 08:21.048
AND YOU BEHAVE
YOURSELF.

08:21.116 --> 08:22.200
I WANT A GOOD
REPORT ON YOU.

08:22.267 --> 08:23.901
HA HA HA.

08:23.968 --> 08:25.553
OH, KEL, ONE SECOND.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.338
HERE ARE HIS PILLS
AND HIS DOCTOR'S NUMBER

08:27.406 --> 08:28.873
AND A LIST OF FOODS
HE CAN'T EAT.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.142
DON'T LET HIM
ORDER ANYTHING SPICY.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.743
THANKS.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.818
OK. TUB'S READY.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.087
SWEET.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.239
WE GOT THE HOUSE
TO OURSELVES.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.108
TIME TO GET
A LITTLE CLEAN...

08:47.176 --> 08:49.593
AND A LITTLE DIRTY.

08:49.661 --> 08:52.796
SO, UH, WHO SHOULD,
UH, GET IN FIRST?

08:52.865 --> 08:56.033
UM,
I'M THINKING YOU.

08:56.101 --> 08:57.718
ALL RIGHT.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.882
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON IN.

09:10.949 --> 09:12.683
WELL, ALL RIGHTY.

09:15.954 --> 09:17.505
OK.
THIS IS NICE.

09:17.572 --> 09:19.924
YEAH.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.660
ALL RIGHT. LET'S
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

09:25.764 --> 09:27.581
WAIT WAIT.
WAIT. YOU GOTTA-

09:27.649 --> 09:29.166
WATCH YOUR KNEE,
HONEY.

09:29.234 --> 09:31.302
OK. SORRY.

09:34.873 --> 09:38.109
THAT'S THE HOT WATER!
TURN IT OFF!

09:38.176 --> 09:39.343
WOULD YOU HURRY UP?!

09:39.411 --> 09:42.129
OK! I'M NOT USED
TO USING MY FOOT AS A HAND!

09:42.197 --> 09:43.731
THAT'S THE WRONG WAY!

09:43.798 --> 09:45.299
I KNOW THAT NOW!

09:45.334 --> 09:47.885
IT'S SCALDING ME!

09:47.953 --> 09:49.803
SAVE YOURSELF!

09:59.298 --> 10:01.799
SO, AFTER WE EAT,
WHAT'S ON TAP?

10:01.866 --> 10:03.817
A JAZZ CLUB?

10:03.885 --> 10:06.587
AMATEUR NIGHT
AT THE APOLLO?

10:08.390 --> 10:11.092
AGAIN,
MINIATURE GOLF.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.593
WONDERFUL.

10:12.661 --> 10:13.745
I THINK WE'RE
READY TO ORDER.

10:13.812 --> 10:16.313
OK. WHAT CAN I
GET YOU FOLKS?

10:16.381 --> 10:17.548
THE BOYS
WILL HAVE RAVIOLI,

10:17.616 --> 10:19.017
AND I WOULD LOVE
A HOUSE SALAD

10:19.084 --> 10:20.184
AND A SPINACH LASAGNA.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.854
SAME FOR ME.
HOW ABOUT YOU, ARTHUR?

10:22.921 --> 10:28.025
I THINK I'LL TRY THE
SPICY SAUSAGE WITH PEPPERS.

10:28.092 --> 10:29.861
UH, ARTHUR...

10:29.928 --> 10:31.328
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:31.396 --> 10:33.747
WELL, CARRIE SAID HE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANYTHING SPICY.

10:33.815 --> 10:35.599
OH. HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
ORDER SOMETHING ELSE?

10:35.667 --> 10:37.134
VERY WELL.

10:37.202 --> 10:39.170
I WILL HAVE...

10:39.237 --> 10:42.439
THE SPICY SAUSAGE
WITH PEPPERS.

10:44.759 --> 10:46.693
ARTHUR.

10:46.761 --> 10:48.930
WELL, IT WAS
WORTH A TRY.

10:48.997 --> 10:50.197
SERIOUSLY, UH,

10:50.265 --> 10:52.867
BRING ME THE SPICY SAUSAGE
WITH PEPPERS, WILL YOU?

10:52.934 --> 10:54.819
WOULD YOU STOP?

10:54.886 --> 10:55.853
I'M A GROWN MAN!

10:55.920 --> 10:57.054
WHY CAN'T I
HAVE WHAT I WANT?

10:57.121 --> 10:58.055
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T!

10:58.122 --> 10:59.390
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD
OF GIVING ME GRIEF,

10:59.458 --> 11:00.758
I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE MORE UPSET

11:00.826 --> 11:05.028
ABOUT WHY WE HAVE BEEN
SEATED NEXT TO THE KITCHEN!

11:05.096 --> 11:07.548
IS IT BECAUSE
WE'RE BLACK?!

11:14.389 --> 11:15.772
JUST GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.875
THANK YOU.

11:21.079 --> 11:23.613
HOW'S THE SPICY SAUSAGE
WITH PEPPERS?

11:36.711 --> 11:40.965
HOW'S HIS STOMACH...
ET CETERA?

11:43.318 --> 11:46.637
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY
LET HIM HAVE SPICY FOOD.

11:48.489 --> 11:50.791
ARE YOU OK?

11:50.859 --> 11:52.993
TALK TO ME,
BABY.

11:53.061 --> 11:55.329
CARRIE, I SAW
THINGS DOWN THERE

11:55.396 --> 11:57.031
THAT NO MAN
SHOULD EVER SEE.

11:57.098 --> 12:00.101
I KNOW. I KNOW. YOU JUST
GOTTA PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND.

12:00.168 --> 12:02.836
I CAN'T.

12:02.904 --> 12:04.788
CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE MILK OF MAGNESIA?

12:04.856 --> 12:06.857
I'M STARTING
TO PERCOLATE AGAIN.

12:08.626 --> 12:09.960
BRINGING IT
RIGHT DOWN, DAD.

12:10.028 --> 12:11.328
NO!

12:11.396 --> 12:14.498
I WILL NOT LET MY
DAUGHTER SEE ME LIKE THIS.

12:14.566 --> 12:16.567
SEND DOUGLAS.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.491
HEY, COME ON IN.

12:23.559 --> 12:25.493
HEY. I KNOW
IT'S PRETTY SHORT NOTICE

12:25.561 --> 12:26.994
TO DUMP THE KIDS
ON YOU AGAIN,

12:27.062 --> 12:29.397
BUT THESE BEYONCE TICKETS
JUST FELL INTO OUR LAP.

12:29.464 --> 12:31.232
NOTHING LIKE
A BEYONCE CONCERT

12:31.300 --> 12:32.866
TO KEEP
A MARRIAGE STRONG.

12:32.934 --> 12:36.587
WE DO THE SAME THING WITH
MONSTER TRUCK RALLIES.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.656
HEY, THANKS FOR TAKING
MY DAD OFF OUR HANDS

12:38.724 --> 12:40.324
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.293
OH, DON'T BE SILLY. WE HAD
A GREAT TIME. RIGHT, BABE?

12:43.395 --> 12:45.096
HE'S SOMETHING.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.364
YEAH, THE ONLY THING IS, AND
MAYBE YOU GUYS JUST FORGOT,

12:47.432 --> 12:50.034
UH, BUT YOU LET HIM
HAVE SPICY FOOD,

12:50.102 --> 12:52.436
AND, WELL, WE WERE UP
WITH HIM ALL NIGHT.

12:52.504 --> 12:53.821
YEAH. UM...

12:53.889 --> 12:55.288
WE TOLD HIM THAT
HE COULDN'T HAVE IT,

12:55.356 --> 12:59.126
AND, YOU KNOW, HE MADE A BIG
SCENE AND STARTED YELLING, SO-

12:59.193 --> 13:01.912
SO... YOU JUST
LET HIM YELL.

13:01.980 --> 13:05.783
DIDN'T REALLY WANNA DO THAT
IN A CROWDED RESTAURANT.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.669
AND I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT, KELL,

13:08.737 --> 13:10.271
UM, I DO.

13:10.339 --> 13:13.241
BUT IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN MAJOR AND KIRBY

13:13.308 --> 13:16.677
ARE YELLING FOR STUFF,
WHICH THEY DO A LOT,

13:16.745 --> 13:19.296
UM, WE CAN ALSO JUST
FORGET THE RULES

13:19.364 --> 13:24.134
AND SAY, "SURE, YOU CAN USE
THAT DRILL TO PLAY DENTIST,"

13:24.202 --> 13:26.236
BUT WE DON'T.

13:26.304 --> 13:27.121
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:27.189 --> 13:28.406
NEXT TIME HE YELLS,

13:28.473 --> 13:29.890
JUST GIVE HIM
A PIECE OF TAFFY.

13:29.958 --> 13:32.059
THAT'LL BUY YOU
45 MINUTES.

13:36.948 --> 13:38.331
NEXT TIME?

13:38.399 --> 13:40.350
YEAH. WE'RE TAKING
YOUR KIDS THIS TIME,

13:40.418 --> 13:42.219
NEXT TIME,
YOU TAKE ARTHUR.

13:42.286 --> 13:45.106
RIGHT.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.391
IT IS RIGHT.

13:49.293 --> 13:50.127
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO

13:50.195 --> 13:51.378
IF WE'RE GONNA
MAKE THAT SHOW, SO-

13:51.446 --> 13:52.413
OK.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.414
YOU TWO
TAKE IT EASY.

13:53.481 --> 13:54.514
WE'LL SEE YOU
IN A FEW HOURS.

13:54.582 --> 13:55.983
BE GOOD.

13:56.051 --> 13:57.751
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
GET THE BURGERS GOING,

13:57.819 --> 13:59.586
AND YOU GUYS JUST
PICK OUT A VIDEO, OK?

13:59.654 --> 14:00.720
OK.
OK.

14:02.340 --> 14:03.707
DID YOU CATCH THE
ATTITUDE COMING FROM THEM?

14:03.774 --> 14:04.708
HARD TO MISS.

14:04.775 --> 14:05.976
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

14:05.994 --> 14:07.144
I DON'T THINK
THEY JUST LET MY DAD

14:07.212 --> 14:08.896
HAVE SPICY FOOD
BECAUSE HE WAS YELLING.

14:08.964 --> 14:10.831
THEY WANTED HIM
TO HAVE IT.

14:10.899 --> 14:13.200
THEY FIGURED THEY'D
MAKE IT SO TOUGH ON US

14:13.268 --> 14:15.602
THAT WE WOULDN'T ASK
THEM TO TAKE ARTHUR AGAIN.

14:15.670 --> 14:17.855
RIGHT! AND MEANWHILE, WE'RE
SO GOOD WITH THEIR KIDS.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.473
WE'RE FREAKIN' GREAT.

14:19.541 --> 14:21.359
AUNT CARRIE?
WHAT IS IT NOW?

14:21.426 --> 14:24.061
CAN I HAVE SOME
MAYONNAISE ON MY HAMBURGER?

14:24.128 --> 14:26.096
YES, YOU CAN HAVE
MAYONNAISE ON YOUR HAMBURGER.

14:26.164 --> 14:27.381
CAN WE HAVE
COFFEE, TOO?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.716
NO, SWEETIE.
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU-

14:28.783 --> 14:33.086
COFFEE! COFFEE!
COFFEE! COFFEE! COFFEE!

14:38.527 --> 14:41.395
OK. GO GET ME YOUR SIPPY CUPS. HURRY UP.

14:51.522 --> 14:52.790
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT.

14:52.857 --> 14:53.791
SETTLE DOWN.

14:53.858 --> 14:55.793
WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU GUYS?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.595
AUNT CARRIE
GAVE US COFFEE.

14:57.662 --> 15:02.399
COFFEE! COFFEE!
COFFEE! COFFEE! COFFEE!

15:05.603 --> 15:07.138
HERE YOU GO.

15:11.659 --> 15:13.827
<i>WHAT DOES
"CALIENTE" MEAN?</i>

15:13.895 --> 15:17.214
IT MEANS "DELICIOUS."

15:17.282 --> 15:18.882
HMM.

15:20.502 --> 15:23.287
"AND THEN, EYES
WIDENING IN HORROR,

15:23.355 --> 15:25.422
<i>"HE SAW
THE WORD REDRUM</i>

15:25.490 --> 15:28.024
"REFLECTING DIMLY
FROM THE GLASS DOME

15:28.092 --> 15:29.793
"NOW REFLECTED TWICE.

15:29.861 --> 15:32.129
<i>"AND HE SAW THAT
IT SPELLED MURDER.</i>

15:32.196 --> 15:34.898
DANNY TORRANCE SCREAMED
IN WRETCHED TERROR."

15:34.966 --> 15:36.533
AAH!

15:38.820 --> 15:41.305
LOOK WHAT THEY BOUGHT ME
AT RADIO SHACK!

15:54.352 --> 15:56.954
ARE WE GONNA
DO ANYTHING TONIGHT?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.622
OH, YEAH. WE'RE
GONNA DO SOMETHING.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.624
JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT YET, BABE.

16:02.694 --> 16:06.163
BUT IT WILL BE GOOD.

16:07.282 --> 16:09.733
ALL RIGHT.
SO, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

16:09.801 --> 16:11.468
WANNA DO THE COFFEE
THING AGAIN?

16:11.536 --> 16:14.838
OK. THAT IS
SO 2 WEEKS AGO.

16:14.905 --> 16:18.793
DOUGLAS! DID YOU BORROW
MY ARGYLE SOCKS?

16:23.064 --> 16:25.249
NO.

16:25.317 --> 16:29.186
YOUR FEET ARE 8 SIZES BIGGER THAN MINE.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.404
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY
BOUGHT HIM A MEGAPHONE.

16:31.472 --> 16:34.107
WELL, WHEN WE SENT THEM
HOME WITH THAT FERRET,

16:34.175 --> 16:36.911
WE KNEW THEY'D COME
BACK AT US PRETTY HARD.

16:38.112 --> 16:40.180
OH, MAN. THIS THING'S GETTING CRAZY.

16:40.248 --> 16:42.182
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
BE THE BIGGER COUPLE

16:42.250 --> 16:44.434
AND STOP ASKING THEM
TO TAKE ARTHUR.

16:44.502 --> 16:45.669
WHAT?!

16:45.737 --> 16:48.239
AND GIVE UP
OUR ALONE TIME?

16:48.306 --> 16:50.591
HONEY, ARE YOU REALLY
ENJOYING IT THAT MUCH?

16:52.109 --> 16:53.544
IT IS WHAT IT IS,
YOU KNOW,

16:53.611 --> 16:55.512
BUT THAT'S
NOT THE POINT!

16:55.580 --> 16:57.531
OK? THERE IS
A PRINCIPLE HERE.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.384
WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP
WHEN WE KNOW WE'RE RIGHT.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.253
UPDATE ON THE SOCKS.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.022
THEY WERE IN THE DRYER
THE WHOLE TIME.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.707
ALL RIGHT, IF WE'RE
GONNA KEEP DOING THIS,

17:07.775 --> 17:09.675
THEN WE GOTTA GO FOR
A KNOCKOUT PUNCH.

17:09.743 --> 17:11.095
OK? SOMETHING THEY
CAN'T GET UP FROM.

17:11.162 --> 17:12.896
OK.

17:25.843 --> 17:27.477
I'LL GET IT.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.882
HEY!
HOW'S IT GOING?

17:32.950 --> 17:34.835
WE'RE HERE
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

17:34.903 --> 17:35.919
HI, MOM.
HI, DAD.

17:35.987 --> 17:37.421
HI, BABY.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.539
HEY, BUD.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

17:38.607 --> 17:42.342
YOU DOIN' ALL RIGHT?
COOL. ALL RIGHT.

17:42.410 --> 17:44.728
UM... WHERE'S
YOUR BROTHER?

17:44.796 --> 17:47.430
I DON'T KNOW. KIRBY? I
THINK HE SCAMPERED UPSTAIRS.

17:47.498 --> 17:49.299
WE HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM IN A WHILE.

17:50.885 --> 17:52.152
KIRBY?
KIRBY?

17:52.220 --> 17:55.088
KIRBY?!
KIRBY!

17:55.156 --> 17:56.773
CHECK THE BEDROOM!

17:56.841 --> 17:58.809
RIGHT BY THE MAKEUP.

18:00.695 --> 18:03.731
OH, MY GOD! HE LOOKS LIKE LIZA MINELLI!

18:06.100 --> 18:08.335
I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

18:08.403 --> 18:10.254
I THINK WE DO.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.505
THIS WHOLE THING
HAS GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND,

18:11.573 --> 18:13.540
AND IT'S HURTING
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.070
WELL, LOOK, WE DIDN'T
MEAN TO HURT ANYBODY,

18:26.137 --> 18:27.638
BUT YOU GUYS
STARTED IT

18:27.706 --> 18:29.740
WHEN YOU GAVE
MY DAD SPICY FOOD.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.776
AND YOU ENDED IT BY GIVING
MY KID AN EXTREME MAKEOVER.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.063
THE POINT IS YOU'RE
THE KIDS' GODPARENTS

18:36.130 --> 18:37.364
AND THEY LOVE
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU,

18:37.432 --> 18:38.732
SO WE WANNA
WORK THIS OUT.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.600
WE WANNA
WORK IT OUT, TOO,

18:39.668 --> 18:41.585
BUT IT HAS TO WORK OUT FOR ALL OF US.

18:41.653 --> 18:42.452
I AGREE.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.804
SO WE HAVE COME UP

18:43.871 --> 18:46.407
WITH WHAT WE THINK IS A
VERY REASONABLE PROPOSAL.

18:46.474 --> 18:48.692
LAY IT ON US.

18:48.759 --> 18:49.993
YOU KEEP
TAKING THE KIDS,

18:50.061 --> 18:51.494
WE STOP TAKING ARTHUR,

18:51.562 --> 18:53.930
BUT... WHEN
THE FOUR OF US GO OUT,

18:53.998 --> 18:56.350
WE PICK UP
2 OUT OF EVERY 3 CHECKS.

18:56.417 --> 18:59.353
AND THAT BEANBAG CHAIR IN
OUR PLACE THAT DOUG LIKES,

18:59.420 --> 19:00.988
IT'S ALL YOURS.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.845
THAT CHAIR WAS LEAKING
BEANS LAST TIME I SAW IT.

19:08.913 --> 19:10.730
I'LL PATCH IT UP.

19:14.152 --> 19:17.521
NO. THIS HAS TO BE
ABOUT YOU TAKING ARTHUR.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.890
YEAH, AND JUST AS MUCH
AS WE TAKE THE KIDS.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.608
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

19:21.676 --> 19:22.710
RIDICULOUS?

19:22.777 --> 19:24.177
YOU GUYS HAVE
A GOOD EVENING.

19:24.245 --> 19:26.580
WAIT. TAKE IT EASY.
TAKE IT EASY. COME ON.

19:26.648 --> 19:28.115
SIT DOWN.

19:32.587 --> 19:34.221
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TAKE ARTHUR,

19:34.288 --> 19:35.623
BUT IT CAN'T BE AS MUCH
AS YOU TAKE THE KIDS.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.190
IT'S JUST TOO WEIRD.

19:37.258 --> 19:39.276
WELL, HOW OFTEN? HOW MANY TIMES A MONTH?

19:49.170 --> 19:50.304
OK.

19:50.371 --> 19:52.706
OH, COME ON. IT WAS
JUST AN OPENING FIGURE.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.508
IT'S A ONE
WITH A QUESTION MARK.

19:55.576 --> 19:56.727
ALL RIGHT.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.495
MAYBE WE CAN TAKE HIM
2 OR 3 TIMES A MONTH,

19:58.563 --> 20:00.130
BUT HE'S JUST SO CRAZY.

20:00.197 --> 20:02.232
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S SO
CRAZY WHEN YOU GET HIM.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.268
HE DOES TAKE HIS BLUE
PILL AT 6:00 EVERY DAY.

20:05.336 --> 20:05.986
WELL, IT AIN'T
DOIN' THE JOB.

20:06.054 --> 20:07.338
OK, LOOK.
HOW ABOUT THIS?

20:07.405 --> 20:08.405
IF WE TAKE HIM,
YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM

20:08.472 --> 20:09.907
MORE THAN ONE PILL.

20:09.974 --> 20:12.692
WELL, HOW MANY MORE
ARE WE TALKING HERE?

20:19.650 --> 20:23.420
THAT MANY?
THAT'LL KILL HIM!

20:23.488 --> 20:26.123
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

20:28.693 --> 20:31.362
HOW ABOUT WE
BUMP IT UP TO 2?

20:31.429 --> 20:34.097
AND A SHOT
OF COUGH SYRUP.

20:34.164 --> 20:35.999
DONE.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.551
SO WE'RE BACK IN THE
BEST FRIENDS BUSINESS?

20:37.618 --> 20:38.719
I THINK SO.

20:38.787 --> 20:39.953
I'M GLAD WE GOT
THIS OVER WITH,

20:40.021 --> 20:41.254
'CAUSE YOU TWO
FIGHT GHETTO.

20:41.322 --> 20:42.956
YOU STARTED
WITH THE-

20:43.024 --> 20:44.892
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

20:44.959 --> 20:47.161
WE ARE VERY AWARE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT US,

20:47.228 --> 20:48.862
AND WE DON'T
APPRECIATE IT.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.547
TO SHOW MY DISPLEASURE,

20:50.615 --> 20:53.233
I'VE POLISHED OFF
A FULL PLATTER

20:53.301 --> 20:56.203
OF THE SPICY
GARLIC SHRIMP.

20:58.889 --> 21:01.224
YOU'VE GOT 12 MINUTES.

21:14.522 --> 21:17.440
HEY, YOU GUYS. HEY, HONEY,
DOUG AND CARRIE ARE HERE.

21:17.508 --> 21:18.909
HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

21:18.977 --> 21:21.511
GREAT. HOW'D THINGS GO
WITH MY DAD? OH, GREAT.

21:21.579 --> 21:23.763
HERE'S
THE LITTLE FELLA.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.584
<i>HE FELL ASLEEP
DURING SCARFACE.</i>

21:27.651 --> 21:29.102
AW.

21:29.170 --> 21:32.606
OK. WE'LL JUST PUT HIM IN
HIS PAJAMAS WHEN WE GET HOME.
