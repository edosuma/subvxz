TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.600 --> 00:05.329
I'm sending you into exile.

00:05.430 --> 00:08.934
Kill me now, or this won't
be the last you see of me.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.598
It will if you want
Isabela to live.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.075
Tony, get down!
Get down!

00:12.180 --> 00:13.533
(tires screech)

00:13.640 --> 00:16.245
(dramatic music)

00:16.350 --> 00:19.114
Brenda.
(sobbing)

00:19.220 --> 00:20.278
No!

00:20.380 --> 00:22.018
TONY: You said
you will protect me.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.111
As soon as I make enough money,
I'll come for you.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.051
(tires screech)

00:26.160 --> 00:27.252
CASTEL: I'm Castel Fieto.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.453
I have connections
In government.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.289
You made a deal with my uncle
but not with me.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.119
TERESA: Isn't Reynaldo
in charge of her family?

00:33.230 --> 00:34.458
(groans)

00:34.560 --> 00:36.926
JAMES: Selling on the dark web,
cutting out the middleman,

00:37.030 --> 00:38.566
and turning product
into champagne.

00:38.670 --> 00:39.637
We did it.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.688
Been a hell of a ride,
but this is where I get off.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.563
I'm gonna miss you.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.809
EPIFANIO:
You need to learn to relax,

00:45.910 --> 00:47.104
like your brother here.
Look at him.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.802
Well, maybe he knows
something I don't.

00:48.910 --> 00:49.877
-(gunshot)
-Oh!

00:51.380 --> 00:53.712
TERESA: We'll work together.
You'll run Sinaloa.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.776
You can count on that,
Teresa Mendoza.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.245
We need more men.

00:57.350 --> 01:01.150
That's why we contacted
Javier Jimenez, Boaz's cousin.

01:01.260 --> 01:04.388
He's one of the
toughest cabrnes I know.

01:04.490 --> 01:06.754
48 hours ago,
we didn't have a supplier.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.090
Now we own the corridor
all the way from Sinaloa

01:09.200 --> 01:10.326
down to Phoenix.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.432
-Salud.
-Salud.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.996
POTE: Where are we going?

01:14.100 --> 01:15.465
You'll see.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.434
MAN: They say money
is the root of all evil,

01:19.540 --> 01:21.337
butthats
the first place I read:

01:21.440 --> 01:23.943
"In God we trust."

01:24.050 --> 01:25.802
Crazy, ain't it?

01:25.910 --> 01:29.073
-(hip-hop music)
-(man rapping in Spanish)

01:29.190 --> 01:31.283
TERESA: Running a cartel
is like driving a motorcycle

01:31.390 --> 01:34.814
a hundred miles an hour
In trafﬁc.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.626
Any miscalculation,

01:36.730 --> 01:39.494
any mistake can have
fatal consequences.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.794
MAN:
* She lives for the Queen

01:40.900 --> 01:42.458
* Gave her life to the game

01:42.570 --> 01:44.458

but she sweet with the cane *

TERESA:
No one gives you a manual

02:16.230 --> 02:17.822
on how to be the boss.

02:18.530 --> 02:21.135
So every difficult decision

02:21.240 --> 02:22.798
falls on you.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.003
And when your people fail you,

02:25.110 --> 02:26.805
as hard as it is,

02:26.910 --> 02:29.640
you have no choice
but to let them go.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.742

02:57.870 --> 02:59.007

of the deck *

02:59.110 --> 03:00.031
* She's the queen
of the chess *

03:00.140 --> 03:02.176

03:02.280 --> 03:03.406
TERESA:
History and human nature

03:03.510 --> 03:06.001
have proven time and again

03:06.110 --> 03:08.010

-Where are we?

04:17.050 --> 04:20.087
Took six months to get
everything lined up.

04:20.190 --> 04:22.181
You'll receive your shipment
by the end of the week.

04:22.290 --> 04:24.986
Good.
We'll talk soon.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.352
You got it, boss.

TERESA: 30,000 square feet
of commercial property.

05:48.610 --> 05:50.544
Restaurants,

05:50.650 --> 05:52.208
stores,

05:52.310 --> 05:53.538
a movie theater.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.714
Our future.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.447
You want to build a mall?

05:58.590 --> 06:00.717
I want us_ to own
legal busmesses.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.850
That's why we're expanding.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.025
We already own a big piece
of the southwest.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.757
Expanding could bring risk.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.860
If we make more money,

06:11.970 --> 06:13.369
we can buy more real estate.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.738
Then we won't have to work
with people like Castel and Boaz

06:17.840 --> 06:19.979
who_ even murder
their own family.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.640
You really think we could
be legit in the U.S.?

06:23.750 --> 06:26.310
Many great American
family fortunes

06:26.420 --> 06:27.569
started with crime.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.819
-(chuckles)
-Why not us?

06:32.320 --> 06:34.788
You could have
your restaurant here.

06:34.890 --> 06:35.914
What do you think?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.155
Potemkin Cantina.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.751
(laughs)
I like it.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.161

to get a message to James?

06:51.270 --> 06:52.476

07:05.520 --> 07:06.657
GEORGE:
Why wouldn't it be?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.580
It's just a truck
full of cacti.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.988
Load her up.
Hey, principessa.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.455
-How are you?
-Oh.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.152

07:53.070 --> 07:55.959
CASTEL: I apologize
for my unannounced visit.

07:56.070 --> 07:57.867
I'm on my way to LA
for a meeting,

07:57.970 --> 07:58.902
and I wanted to come in person

07:59.010 --> 08:00.568
to give you some
really good news.

08:05.210 --> 08:07.019
I pulled some strings
with a friend

08:07.120 --> 08:08.849
in the Mexican government,
and...

08:11.550 --> 08:15.088
You're no longer wanted for
the murder of Epifanio Vargas.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.721
You must have powerful friends.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.491
Mm-hmm.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.329
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.663
Why are you really here?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.667
I have a problem.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.662
A small group
of Colombian farmers

08:31.770 --> 08:34.204
are cutting into my business,
and I heard

08:34.310 --> 08:37.108
that they're getting ready
to ship to New Orleans.

08:37.210 --> 08:38.871
You think I'm the buyer?

08:39.780 --> 08:40.747
Are you?

08:41.620 --> 08:44.680
I made a deal with you
and only you.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.886
I'm sorry for my suspicions,

08:49.990 --> 08:51.355
but you know
in this line of work,

08:51.460 --> 08:53.519
there's an enemy
in every corner.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.757
That doesn't mean
we need to create them

08:55.860 --> 08:57.225
where they don't exist.

08:57.330 --> 09:03.030
*

09:03.140 --> 09:05.631
I bet on you, Teresa.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.077
I appreciate that you did.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.819
Thank you.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.315
I have to go.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.782
I'll let you know when
the next shipment is ready.

09:20.890 --> 09:27.227

09:27.330 --> 09:29.127
-Have a safe trip.
-Thank you.

09:33.170 --> 09:39.461
*

09:39.570 --> 09:41.276
That's not a show of force.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.644
(car doors slamming)

09:43.750 --> 09:44.671
It's fear.

JAVIER:
All the agave was unloaded.

10:03.530 --> 10:05.191
We're ready to bottle
the product.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.461
So now we're up and running, we
strictly dark webbing it again?

10:07.570 --> 10:10.266
No, we need a distributor
to expand into the East Coast,

10:10.370 --> 10:13.009
someone who can introduce us
to the maJor players.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.172
-Javier has an idea.
-Rau| Rodriguez.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.976
He's a Cuban dealer
out of Miami.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.548
He moves about a ton a month
in Southern Florida.

10:21.650 --> 10:23.789
He has connections
all the way up to Canada.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.039
GEORGE: I heard of him.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.856
Call him El Gordo
'cause he used to be the shape

10:26.960 --> 10:28.951
of one of them roasted pigs
in Little Havana.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.551
(chuckles)
It's quite delicious, actually.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.719
Didn't he do business
with Epifanio?

10:33.830 --> 10:36.048
Ay, and then Camila.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.866
With both of them gone,

10:37.970 --> 10:39.494
he was forced to become
his own smuggler.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.739
GEORGE: Which makes
his deliveries unreliable.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.401
There was a huge bust,
Port of Miami last month, DEA.

10:45.510 --> 10:46.829
That's why I think
I can convince him

10:46.940 --> 10:48.009
to do business with us.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.838
Listen, I wanted to remind
you guys something:

10:51.950 --> 10:54.043
no unnecessary violence.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.242
Keep a low profile.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.848
In this city, we're
legitimate business owners.

10:58.950 --> 10:59.882
'Kay?

11:01.020 --> 11:01.987
Thank you.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.153
I have a meeting at the bar.
See you guys later.

11:07.430 --> 11:08.829

11:40.460 --> 11:42.599
Mmm.
What's it called?

11:42.700 --> 11:43.792
The Teresita,

11:43.900 --> 11:45.788
after your cute-ass nickname
for the boss.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.869
-(chuckles)
-Patrna, what took you so long?

11:48.970 --> 11:51.029
It's a nice day.
We walked.

11:52.270 --> 11:53.806
Ren Bardot,
the liquor board rep,

11:53.910 --> 11:54.934
he's in your office, Teresa.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.439
-Great. Thank you.
-BIRDIE: Mm-hmm.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.949
Spoke to one of El Gordo's men.
We're in luck.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.041
He's in New Orleans
for a cockfight.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.082
Really?

12:05.050 --> 12:07.553
His man told me
he raises his own roosters.

12:07.660 --> 12:11.118
Likes to throw big over-the-top
underground fights.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.994
-We should go.
-Ay.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.920
Gracias.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.759
-Come with me.
-(door opens)

12:17.870 --> 12:19.997
(indistinct chatter)

12:20.100 --> 12:21.988
Mr. Bardot.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.328
I'm Teresa Mendoza.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.437
This is Javier, my manager.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.505
Says in your deed
you got a co-owner,

12:30.610 --> 12:33.477
George...Megalos?

12:33.580 --> 12:34.945
What is that,
Arab?

12:35.650 --> 12:37.117
(laughs)

12:39.650 --> 12:41.959
You know, only citizens
can get liquor licenses

12:42.060 --> 12:44.688
in this place, Ms. Mendoza.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.929
He's American and a busy man.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.657
I'm in charge of the bar.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.819
Well, I'm afraid
I got bad news.

12:50.930 --> 12:53.137
It's gonna take a couple more
months to get you approved.

12:54.670 --> 12:55.762
What's the problem?

12:55.870 --> 12:57.269
I put in applications
six months ago.

12:57.370 --> 13:00.339
Things move real slow
around here,

13:00.440 --> 13:03.170
and us government
employees, well,

13:03.280 --> 13:05.441
we're overworked and, uh,

13:05.550 --> 13:06.539
underpaid.

13:06.650 --> 13:07.947
Maybe I can help.

13:10.020 --> 13:10.987
Javier...

13:18.330 --> 13:20.059
And I don't accept pesos.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.398
(sighs)

13:29.500 --> 13:31.866
(safe beeping)

13:33.680 --> 13:35.170
(safe clicks)

13:41.980 --> 13:43.880
You better watch
that foul attitude, Pancho.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.687
What did you call me?

13:47.090 --> 13:48.978
TERESA_: Javier.
JaVIer.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.652
I think I can move you
to the front of the line.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.718
You can finally
open your doors.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.594
(tense music)

14:01.700 --> 14:08.503
*

14:12.920 --> 14:13.944
BOBBY: (clears throat)

14:15.750 --> 14:17.445
Got us lunch.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.182
You ever see me eat

14:21.290 --> 14:22.689
inside my car?

14:26.090 --> 14:28.695
(wrapper rustling)

14:29.300 --> 14:32.758
MARCEL: A bar owner
with two bodyguards.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.132
(scoffs)

14:34.240 --> 14:35.889
That seems a bit strange to me.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.032
You find out anything
about our new neighbors?

14:39.140 --> 14:41.973
Yeah, they got
a winery in Phoenix.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.438
They make wine in Phoenix?

14:46.110 --> 14:48.442
It all checked out.
They're legit.

14:48.550 --> 14:49.983
-(engine turns over)
-Nah, man.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.888
This is New Orleans;
there ain't nothing legit.

14:52.990 --> 14:59.486
*

15:00.400 --> 15:02.220
It's time we introduce
ourselves.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.592
(engine turns over)

15:10.170 --> 15:11.467
Thank you for the update.

15:13.410 --> 15:14.331
Okay, bye.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.505
-(phone beeps)
-That was Taza.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.776
He says the last load
from Phoenix

15:21.880 --> 15:24.087
came in short five kilos.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.908
I can only think of one person

15:29.020 --> 15:32.421
who has the balls
to steal from us:

15:32.530 --> 15:34.259
Boaz.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.295
If he's stealing from
the Southwest shipment,

15:37.400 --> 15:38.822
he can blame it on Taza.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.200
(phone rings, keypad beeps)

15:43.310 --> 15:45.301
Jefa, you received
the shipment?

15:45.410 --> 15:47.002
Yes.

15:47.110 --> 15:48.702
But we_ have _
a problem in Phoenix.

15:48.810 --> 15:51.347
We're short five kilos.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.645
You want me to send some men
to talk to Taza?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.479
I don't suspect Taza.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.845
I know you're not
accusing me of stealing.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.157
All our product
goes through you.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.627
Teresa, I would
never steal from you.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.789
I give you my word.

16:06.890 --> 16:09.199
Then mistakes are
being made in Sinaloa.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.869
(sighs)
If someone working for me

16:13.970 --> 16:16.131
is stealing from you,

16:16.240 --> 16:18.003
then I'm gonna
take my blowtorch

16:18.110 --> 16:19.964
and I'm gonna go
from house to house

16:20.080 --> 16:23.572
until someone gives up
this pinche pendejo ladrn.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.977
I'm gonna shake
the family tree.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.707
No torturing innocent people.

16:27.750 --> 16:31.743
Find out who it is and
make him pay back what he owes.

16:31.850 --> 16:34.580
You gave me Sinaloa to run.
I'll run it my way.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.885
You run it by my rules, Boaz.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.522
As you wish, jefa.

16:42.630 --> 16:45.098
(phone clacks, keypad beeps)

16:45.200 --> 16:48.089
(foreboding music)

16:48.200 --> 16:52.899
*

16:53.010 --> 16:54.705
-Hold up.
-Easy.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.107
MARCEL: Just looking around.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.012
TERESA: Hello, gentlemen.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.057
Unfortunately,
we're not open yet.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.850
Just wanted to come
by your house,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.552
check out what you did
with the place.

17:13.530 --> 17:16.021
Been about five other owners
of this bar before you.

17:16.130 --> 17:20.191
Like, nobody can seem to, uh,
make any money up in here.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.733
Hopefully, we can change that.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.362
I'm Marcel Dumas.

17:25.470 --> 17:28.200
My business associate,
Bobby Leroux.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.379
Teresa Mendoza.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.368
I own a little jazz spot
down the way,

17:31.480 --> 17:33.869
so I guess you can say that
I'm the welcoming committee.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.214
Bobby, please give
the lady the pralines.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.083
My wife makes those, yeah.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.750
-Better than you can buy 'em.
-Thank you.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.885
It's just a little gift

17:43.990 --> 17:47.494
from the, uh, People of Color
Chamber of Commerce.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.659
Marcel is the president
of the P Triple C.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.092
MARCEL:
We're an informal organization.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.634
It's just people of color

17:54.740 --> 17:55.661
looking out...

17:57.810 --> 17:59.334
For other people of color.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.136
You need the right friends
in this town.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.276
IfI understand correctly,
you, uh,

18:04.380 --> 18:05.642
you're making your own tequila.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.244
Ah, see, most of the locals,
they, uh, stick with rum

18:09.350 --> 18:10.442
or bourbon.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.939
That, uh--that agave...
(exhales)

18:13.050 --> 18:15.416
That's hard to come by.
But...

18:15.520 --> 18:16.782
I guess you're just doing you.

18:16.890 --> 18:19.256
We have an amazing bartender.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.521
We hope we can add something

18:21.630 --> 18:23.188
to the city's
rich cocktail history.

18:23.300 --> 18:27.020
I'm sure you will, but I'll--
uh, promise I'll come back

18:27.140 --> 18:29.768
and, uh, check you out
during your opening.

18:29.870 --> 18:30.837
Please.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.168
Let me know
if you need anything.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.602
-Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

18:42.350 --> 18:43.510
Undercover police?

18:45.050 --> 18:46.847
-I don't think so.
-(phone chimes, buzzes)

18:50.860 --> 18:52.987
JAVIER: (speaks Spanish)

18:53.090 --> 18:54.990
We're in for El Gordo's fight.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.524
50,000 buy-in.

18:58.630 --> 18:59.892
There's a dress code.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.036
A dress code for a cockfight?

19:02.970 --> 19:05.359
(scoffs)
I miss Mexico.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.405
(lively salsa music)

19:08.510 --> 19:15.370
*

19:17.550 --> 19:19.711
There.
There he is.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.185
TERESA: Okay, let's go.

19:27.030 --> 19:28.520
This is crazy.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.518
(clucking)

19:30.630 --> 19:32.928
MAN: Put me down for 500.
Come on, baby, let's go!

19:33.030 --> 19:34.338
MAN: Let's go!

19:34.440 --> 19:39.036
*

19:39.140 --> 19:40.835
WOMAN: That's right, 5,000.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.601
TERESA: Seor Rodriguez.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.075
WOMAN: 5,000, yes.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.509
My name is Teresa Mendoza.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.076
May I have a minute
of your time?

19:50.180 --> 19:51.442
Teresa Mendoza.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.525
Well, if you know me,
then you also know

19:59.630 --> 20:01.552
I have the best product
on the market.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.525
Tasted it once,
impressive.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.462
You see him?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.859
That's my boy, Papito.

20:09.970 --> 20:10.959
Put your money on him.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.609
I'm sorry.
I don't gamble.

20:13.710 --> 20:14.870
Ah, your loss.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.871
-What_are the odds?
-Five to one.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.744
Mm.
(speaks Spanish)

20:21.850 --> 20:23.386
(snaps fingers)

20:23.490 --> 20:24.912
Ten grand on Papito's opponent.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.310
Don't they call you El Gallo?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.657
You should recognize a winner
when you see one.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.318
You're gonna lose
all your money.

20:34.430 --> 20:36.091
But if I win,

20:36.200 --> 20:37.895
I win big.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.399
Five against Papito.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.489
Like the man said.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.160
"IfI win, I win big."

20:45.270 --> 20:47.067
More money for me.

20:47.170 --> 20:48.637
Okay, flaca.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.401
You wanted a minute of my time.
You got it.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.000
Talk.

20:52.110 --> 20:53.839
I know you never meant
to be a smuggler.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.770
I have a unique way
of moving product

20:56.880 --> 20:58.086
that is less risky.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.250
I can offer you 20% off
the first shipment.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.079
-And 10% on any deals that you--
-(feedback squeals)

21:04.190 --> 21:05.487
REFEREE: Ladies and gentlemen,

21:05.590 --> 21:06.955
for the first fight
of the night,

21:07.060 --> 21:09.790
we have the Everglades
versus the Bayou:

21:09.900 --> 21:12.289
the Cuban missile, Papito,

21:12.400 --> 21:15.198
versus the Cajun Killer, Roclq!

21:15.300 --> 21:18.861
-(cheers and applause)
-And we have a fight!

21:18.970 --> 21:22.508
(overlapping shouting)

21:22.610 --> 21:23.872
(rooster squawking)

21:23.980 --> 21:26.039
Go on, please.

21:26.150 --> 21:29.449
There was a DEA raid in Miami.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.211
I can help you with supply.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.784
If I become your supplier
and smuggler,

21:34.890 --> 21:36.187
I could solve
two problems for you.

21:36.290 --> 21:38.485
I don't need
your product, flaca.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.457
I buy my shit from
independent farmers.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.857
(rooster squawks)

21:42.960 --> 21:45.463
I'm done with
the pain-in-the-ass cartels.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.663
No offense, but you people
are always chopping off heads.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.465
This is not how
I run my busmess.

21:49.570 --> 21:50.707
Well, congratulations,

21:50.810 --> 21:54.632
but that doesn't
change my mind.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.208
(crowd whooping)

22:03.920 --> 22:05.478
(shouts excitedly)

22:05.590 --> 22:06.887
(laughs)

22:06.990 --> 22:09.652
(speaks Spanish)

22:09.760 --> 22:12.820
REFEREE: The winner,
Cajun killer Roclq.

22:12.930 --> 22:15.091
(man speaks Spanish, laughs)

22:15.200 --> 22:18.590
-(man shouts, groans)
-EL GORDO: (laughs)

22:18.700 --> 22:20.258
(subdued chatter)

22:24.570 --> 22:27.061

22:27.170 --> 22:28.535
EL GORDO: (laughs)

22:28.640 --> 22:30.005
(indistinct chatter)

22:30.110 --> 22:32.169
Come on!
What's going on?

22:32.280 --> 22:34.339
Dale!
Play some salsa!

22:34.450 --> 22:36.213
This is supposed to be fun!
Come on!

22:37.250 --> 22:38.547
Come on,
pay el gallito his money.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.585
-(salsa music starts up)
-This is about the only cash

22:41.690 --> 22:44.022
you or your people
will ever see from me.

22:44.130 --> 22:50.968
*

22:55.600 --> 22:57.067
Just give me a minute.

22:57.170 --> 22:58.102
POTE: rale.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.139
MAN: Vamos!

23:03.240 --> 23:04.571
You should put
some ice on that.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.278
Gordo used to be fun,

23:10.380 --> 23:11.916
then he got the lap band.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.559
-I think he's just hungry.
-It's still early.

23:15.660 --> 23:18.379
I'm sure you can ﬁnd
something fun to do tonight.

23:18.490 --> 23:19.787
I gotta work.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.420
I thought you were here
just for the fight.

23:23.830 --> 23:24.819
And business.

23:26.570 --> 23:28.891
But, uh,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.935
maybe I can squeeze in
some time for pleasure.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.732
Wanna meet up later?

23:35.840 --> 23:36.772
Maybe.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.175
What time are you done?

23:40.110 --> 23:41.418
Around midnight.

23:42.650 --> 23:43.742
Too late for me.

23:43.850 --> 23:50.688
*

23:51.660 --> 23:54.128
He has a load coming
into New Orleans tonight.

23:54.230 --> 23:56.858
-How do you know?
-Miami's shut down.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.099
Raul needed
a new port of entry.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.997
Castel said
that her competition

24:01.100 --> 24:02.636
was shipping to someone here,

24:02.740 --> 24:05.629
and Cheo just told me
he's working tonight.

24:05.740 --> 24:07.264
Are we making a move?

24:07.370 --> 24:09.975
If he believes
he doesn't need us,

24:10.080 --> 24:11.172
he won't make a deal.

24:13.450 --> 24:15.475
So we have
to make him need us.

24:15.580 --> 24:19.516
(dramatic music)

24:19.620 --> 24:20.552
Let's go.

24:27.460 --> 24:30.520
(foghorn blows in the distance)

24:34.970 --> 24:36.039
(sighs)

24:36.140 --> 24:38.301
Cruise ship just came in
from The Bahamas.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.401
It's the only one coming
into the port tonight.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.700
GEORGE: All right.

24:44.810 --> 24:47.074
Now we look for something
out of the ordinary.

24:50.550 --> 24:53.246
JAVIER: That case could fit
a hundred kilos.

24:53.350 --> 24:55.011
GEORGE: Ah, it's too obvious,

24:55.120 --> 24:57.520
though it would make a good
episode of I Love Lucy.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.824
(both chuckle)

25:01.700 --> 25:02.928
GEORGE: Check out the crew.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.191
And why are
their suitcases so big?

25:07.300 --> 25:09.666
-GEORGE: Mm-hmm.
-It's The Bahamas.

25:09.770 --> 25:11.829
All they need are
a couple of bikinis.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.535
WOMAN: Okay.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.709
WOMAN: See you later.

25:15.810 --> 25:19.041
(indistinct chatter)

25:20.950 --> 25:22.372
GEORGE: Who we got here?

25:29.690 --> 25:30.952
WOMAN: All right.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.687
-Bye.
-(laughs softly)

25:36.530 --> 25:37.963
-(car door slams)
-GEORGE: Teresa's right.

25:38.070 --> 25:42.689
El Gordo's got himself
a crappy rum run.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.769
He needs us more than he knows.
(laughs softly)

25:49.110 --> 25:50.941
(engine turns over)

25:53.150 --> 25:54.640
(engine turns over)

25:54.750 --> 25:57.469
(reggaeton music
playing over radio)

25:57.590 --> 26:00.753
Yo, that cute Mexican jeva
from the fight today?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.418
She was flirting
with me hard, bro.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.996
I could've hit that
if I wasn't working so late.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.427
(laughs softly)

26:14.670 --> 26:17.264
(horn honks)

26:21.480 --> 26:23.607
-(gun clicks)
-Don't do anything stupid.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.746
(suspenseful music)

26:25.850 --> 26:26.805
Give me your guns.

26:26.910 --> 26:32.348
*

26:32.450 --> 26:33.587
(guns rattle)

26:33.690 --> 26:35.908
Get out of the car now.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.992
Move!
Back up!

26:43.870 --> 26:45.462
(reggaeton music
playing over radio)

26:45.570 --> 26:47.162
(engines rev)

26:47.270 --> 26:49.465
(tires screeching)

26:49.570 --> 26:53.108
*

26:53.210 --> 26:55.269
I hate reggaeton.

26:55.380 --> 26:58.349
-(tires squeal)
-(men groaning)

26:58.450 --> 27:01.271
(slow piano music)

27:01.380 --> 27:03.610
*

27:03.720 --> 27:05.608
(phone buzzes)

27:05.720 --> 27:06.846
-(phone beeps)
-Hey.

27:06.950 --> 27:09.680
It's done.
No problem.

27:09.790 --> 27:12.554
TERESA: Great.
Thank you.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.196
Have a good night.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.858
-Bye.
-(phone beeps)

27:19.170 --> 27:22.162
(dramatic music)

27:22.270 --> 27:26.730
*

27:26.840 --> 27:27.807
TERESA: Gracias.

27:27.910 --> 27:30.208
(phone buzzing)

27:30.310 --> 27:32.198
Patrna.

27:32.310 --> 27:33.299
It's Boaz.

27:34.350 --> 27:35.715
(phone beeps)

27:35.820 --> 27:37.344
Que pasa, primo?

27:37.450 --> 27:40.339
What's with this pinche
no torture policy?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.350
People are going
to lose respect for us.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.054
The Jimenez name
still means something,

27:45.160 --> 27:46.855
but if we're soft,
it won't for long.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.257
Have you found who's stealing?

27:49.160 --> 27:50.252
(inhales)

27:50.360 --> 27:52.521
I'm still questioning people.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.439
No one's talking.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.189
JAVIER: Then keep at it.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.269
MAN: (moaning)

28:02.740 --> 28:04.879
He's still looking, patrna.

28:04.980 --> 28:05.901
Gracias.

28:09.550 --> 28:10.619
(grunts)

28:10.720 --> 28:12.938
(vase shatters)

28:13.050 --> 28:14.449
It's that bitch,
Teresa Mendoza.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.188
(shouts) Puta!

28:17.290 --> 28:20.088
*

28:20.190 --> 28:22.920
BIRDIE: Okay,
and then a splash of OJ.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.799
Hey, I said a splash,
not a shower.

28:27.630 --> 28:28.597
Doing?

28:28.770 --> 28:33.104
Cocktails is too much work,
too many ingredients.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.701
Tequila is clean.

28:35.810 --> 28:37.801
BIRDIE: Yeah, till you
drink more than two.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.104
Then it gets real dirty
real fast.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.110
How dirty we talking about?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.711
You are nasty.
You are really nasty.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.139
TERESA: Let's go, Pote.

28:45.250 --> 28:46.444
BIRDIE: (laughs)
Bye.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.051
-Bye, girl.
-See you.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.257
(phone clicks and beeps)

28:54.360 --> 28:55.918
(line trills)

29:00.430 --> 29:01.761
JAVIER: Let me
tell you something.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.235
When you act like a maniac,

29:03.340 --> 29:05.831
people start suspecting you
of not being loyal.

29:05.940 --> 29:08.135
-Are you stealing from Teresa?
-(sighs)

29:11.350 --> 29:13.443
And just because
I question la jefa's style...

29:15.980 --> 29:18.915
This nice guy crap
that Teresa wants...

29:20.990 --> 29:21.957
(speaks Spanish)

29:22.060 --> 29:24.255
She doesn't kill people
as her first option.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.251
Is it so hard
to follow an order?

29:27.360 --> 29:29.157
(laughs softly)

29:29.260 --> 29:31.091
I'll do it

29:31.200 --> 29:33.168
'cause I'm a good soldier.

29:33.270 --> 29:35.534
-Teresa better not forget that.
-JAVIER: No. No, no, no.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.437
Don't you forget
that in this business,

29:37.540 --> 29:38.768
we're all replaceable.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.872
Are you threatening me, primo?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.709
Just giving you
a reality check.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.804
Cabrn.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.811
-(line beeps)
-MAN: (groaning softly)

29:48.920 --> 29:53.311
*

29:53.420 --> 29:57.288
My boss lady wants you
to pay back what you stole.

29:57.390 --> 30:00.484
(grunting softly)

30:00.590 --> 30:02.490
I'm gonna take care
of it for you.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.999
I'm a generous man.

30:09.470 --> 30:10.903
I'm not gonna
touch your family...

30:12.210 --> 30:13.199
Just you.

30:21.750 --> 30:24.742
(birds chirping)

30:29.990 --> 30:32.379
(car doors slam)

30:37.870 --> 30:39.098
What is this?

30:40.030 --> 30:40.997
Your house.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.899
Teresita.

30:44.570 --> 30:46.162
This is too much.
I can't.

30:46.270 --> 30:47.259
Yes, you can.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.444
Let's check inside.

30:53.250 --> 30:56.617
(soft music)

30:56.720 --> 30:58.210
POTE: Whoa.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.049
TERESA: (laughs)
Go inside.

31:00.150 --> 31:03.881
*

31:03.990 --> 31:05.457
Teresita!

31:11.770 --> 31:14.466
Nobody has ever done
something like this for me.

31:14.570 --> 31:16.868
You deserve it.
You work hard.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.961
You protect me.
You counsel me.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.879
You're my friend, my family.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.699
How can I protect you
if I stay here?

31:25.810 --> 31:27.402
I'm gonna be too far from you.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.149
You need your own house
to live your life.

31:31.050 --> 31:33.245
After everything
we've been through,

31:33.350 --> 31:35.409
this is a new start.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.227
_ It seems like
Since we moved here,

31:38.330 --> 31:39.388
you need less of me.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.153
Everyone I loved is gone,
except for you.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.719
I will always need you
by my side.

31:48.970 --> 31:50.460
(phone buzzes)

31:51.510 --> 31:53.000
It's Raul.

31:54.140 --> 31:56.108
(phone beeps)

31:56.210 --> 31:58.007
-Hello?
-Flaca.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.577
I need to
talk business with you.

32:00.410 --> 32:03.015
Meet me at the same place
I had the fight.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.087
-TERESA: I'll be there--
-(phone beeps)

32:05.990 --> 32:06.945
He wants to meet.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.416
-It could be a trap.
-It is a trap.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.624
He's a businessman.
He wants to make money.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.459
We can make him money.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.652
Let's go.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.921
We are bringing guns, right?

32:19.030 --> 32:20.292
Teresita?

32:20.400 --> 32:23.198
(tense music)

32:23.300 --> 32:28.431
*

32:28.540 --> 32:29.837
CHEO: Only you.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.706
She doesn't go anywhere
without me, cabrn.

32:34.650 --> 32:37.448
-No guns.
-No guns.

32:37.550 --> 32:44.388
*

32:48.900 --> 32:50.219
-Hey.
-I'm not armed.

33:13.090 --> 33:16.253
-(plastic rustling)
-Teresita.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.852
(lights click, door rattling)

33:22.200 --> 33:23.895
I thought you didn't
gamble, flaca.

33:25.930 --> 33:27.488
I don't consider this a gamble.

33:29.770 --> 33:30.737
This is for you.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.831
Well, thank you.

33:34.940 --> 33:37.500
But it doesn't seem like
the appropriate time for a toast

33:37.610 --> 33:40.170
right before
you're about to die.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.918
It's a bottle
of liquid cocaine.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.009
(laughs)

33:43.120 --> 33:44.610
This is how
I smuggle my product.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.714
This is cocaine?

33:47.820 --> 33:49.879
Yes, a whole kilo.

33:49.990 --> 33:51.423
We ship liquid,

33:51.530 --> 33:53.725
and your people convert it
into powder.

33:53.830 --> 33:55.695
I've been using this system
for a year now.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.256
The DEA hasn't caught us.

33:57.360 --> 34:02.969
*

34:03.070 --> 34:04.901
I want you to know

34:05.010 --> 34:08.104
that I run this organization
like a normal business.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.201
I can be
a good partner to you.

34:10.310 --> 34:12.403
Well, good partners don't steal
from each other.

34:14.420 --> 34:18.481
My men got carjacked,
and my cocaine is gone

34:18.590 --> 34:20.911
the very same day you came
looking to be my new supplier.

34:21.020 --> 34:22.556
How about that, huh?

34:22.660 --> 34:24.651
If I did that to you,

34:24.760 --> 34:27.320
you think I would come here
with only one man by my side?

34:32.600 --> 34:33.999
You're not a smuggler.

34:35.470 --> 34:36.960
Anyone could have
seen something

34:37.070 --> 34:38.298
and followed your men.

34:40.670 --> 34:42.308
My offer still stands,

34:42.410 --> 34:46.244
and I can give you 50% discount
on the first shipment.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.649
(chuckling)

34:50.750 --> 34:51.682
Ah.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.011
I like money more than murder.

34:59.590 --> 35:01.296
(chuckles)

35:03.830 --> 35:05.821
(laughs)

35:05.930 --> 35:06.919
I tell you what.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.964
If you can get that cocaine
to Miami in 48 hours,

35:12.070 --> 35:13.332
you got yourself a new buyer.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.141
I'll show up with an army.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.374
Hmm?

35:20.480 --> 35:27.318
*

35:32.690 --> 35:35.693
(jazz music playing)

35:35.800 --> 35:40.225
*

35:40.330 --> 35:43.299
(indistinct chatter)

35:43.400 --> 35:50.238
*

36:08.260 --> 36:12.890
(cheers and applause)

36:14.870 --> 36:17.839
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

36:17.940 --> 36:20.101
I have a student
in the audience tonight.

36:20.210 --> 36:22.929
Thanks for clapping.
I'll pay y'all on my way out.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.600
(laughter)

36:25.710 --> 36:27.268
Good job, guys.
I'll catch y'all later.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.685
(mellow jazz music)

36:31.790 --> 36:34.452
*

36:34.560 --> 36:35.618
Didn't think you'd make it.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.915
Me neither.

36:39.090 --> 36:40.455
That was really nice.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.395
We should get out of here.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.894
-I know a place.
-Cool.

36:48.870 --> 36:51.737
(soft lounge music)

36:51.840 --> 36:54.229
A lot of my friends abandoned
the city after Katrina.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.734
But I put down
even deeper roots.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.070
Bought this old church.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.579
I wanted to turn it into

37:02.680 --> 37:05.217
a recording studio
and performance space.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.608
Mm.
That's nice.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.312
It was in real rough shape.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.980
(laughs)
It's still in rough shape.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.829
I'm doing
all the work myself.

37:18.430 --> 37:19.761
And it's given me a purpose.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.897
That church saved me.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.729
Saved you from what?

37:27.310 --> 37:29.107
Story for another time.

37:30.910 --> 37:32.901
(chuckles)

37:33.010 --> 37:35.808
I know what it's like
to work hard to build something.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.311
Yeah?

37:38.420 --> 37:39.341
Tell me about it.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.311
Story for another time.

37:42.420 --> 37:44.627
(both laugh)

37:46.830 --> 37:49.298
It was great
seeing you play tonight.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.822
How about you?

37:50.930 --> 37:53.421
Still haven't done
the student recital yet.

37:53.530 --> 37:56.431
*

37:56.540 --> 37:58.701
I am not playing in public.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.459
This is happening.

38:01.940 --> 38:04.170
I'll make it simple,

38:04.280 --> 38:05.599
just some scales.

38:10.150 --> 38:12.710
-(plays notes)
-(laughs)

38:12.820 --> 38:17.052
*

38:17.160 --> 38:18.457
You got it.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.222
-(laughs)
-Once more.

38:21.330 --> 38:22.490
All right.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.819
*

38:25.930 --> 38:26.862
D flat.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.729
*

38:33.970 --> 38:36.973
(soft dramatic music)

38:37.080 --> 38:43.713
*

39:07.610 --> 39:09.532
BOBBY: Marcel wants us
on Mendoza's truck.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.777
Let's go.

39:12.050 --> 39:15.269
(ominous music)

39:15.380 --> 39:20.886
*

39:20.990 --> 39:21.957
Hey, Chicho.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.280
Pote sent you, right?

39:27.130 --> 39:28.620
Ms. Mendoza.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.723
Detective Randall Green,

39:31.830 --> 39:33.366
New Orleans Parish Police.

39:33.470 --> 39:35.131
You have a warrant?

39:35.240 --> 39:38.869
This is not a request,
Ms. Mendoza.

39:41.040 --> 39:44.032
(insects chirping)

39:44.140 --> 39:50.978
*

39:54.820 --> 39:55.912
(car door slams)

40:03.300 --> 40:05.621
(bug zapper crackling)

40:06.470 --> 40:07.721
MAN: Go on now.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.807
Go on.

40:18.010 --> 40:19.739
JUDGE LAFAYE'I'I'E:
Hello, Ms. Mendoza.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.971
You must be somewhat confused.

40:24.820 --> 40:27.448
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Judge Cecil Lafayette.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.683
-Am I under arrest?
-Arrest?

40:32.790 --> 40:35.691
Oh, because of that little bit
of money you gave Ren?

40:35.800 --> 40:37.290
No, darling, we just--

40:37.400 --> 40:38.765
we just having
a little chitchat about

40:38.870 --> 40:42.465
those two liquor licenses
you so desperately desire.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.530
You see,
Ren is just the gatekeeper.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.505
I'm the decision-maker.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.635
(bug zapper crackling)

40:50.740 --> 40:53.277
I'm new to New Orleans.

40:53.380 --> 40:56.110
I'm just starting to know
how it all works.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.939
Well, let me--let me help you.
(clears throat)

40:59.050 --> 41:03.111
To run a business in my city,
you need to pay taxes,

41:03.220 --> 41:05.780
and those--those taxes
shall be remitted

41:05.890 --> 41:07.380
to yours truly.

41:09.130 --> 41:10.791
Hell, why don't we make it
easy for you, uh...

41:10.900 --> 41:12.492
10,000?

41:14.130 --> 41:16.394
Renovating was expensive.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.639
I don't have anything liquid.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.537
It'll take me
a couple of weeks.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.529
Mm, couple of weeks, mm.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.699
(bug zapper crackling loudly)

41:28.080 --> 41:29.342
You like roses?

41:31.050 --> 41:34.315
Most people think
they're difficult to grow,

41:34.420 --> 41:37.651
but they're just
demanding little ladies.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.479
They need six to eight hours
of sun a day,

41:40.590 --> 41:43.991
l-lots of space so their roots
can spread out.

41:45.570 --> 41:48.892
But you know what
the key ingredient is

41:49.000 --> 41:50.888
to a prize-winning rose?

41:53.170 --> 41:54.102
Blood.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.500
Now, most botanists
will tell you

41:57.610 --> 41:59.601
you can use blood meal
from an animal.

41:59.710 --> 42:01.177
It has all the nitrogen
she needs.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.845
But I'm of the mind
that this lady has thorns

42:06.950 --> 42:08.087
for a reason.

42:09.020 --> 42:12.956
She lusts for what runs
through our human veins.

42:13.060 --> 42:16.052
Luckily, blood...

42:16.160 --> 42:18.048
we have in spades.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.027
(bug zapper crackling)

42:21.130 --> 42:22.768
I'll give you two days.

42:24.470 --> 42:25.767
Have a blessed evening.

42:29.610 --> 42:31.601
(door creaks)

42:31.710 --> 42:38.582
*

42:42.120 --> 42:44.213
Little girl thinks
she can turn Bourbon Street

42:44.320 --> 42:45.753
into Tequila Street.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.088
(scoffs)

42:47.190 --> 42:48.657
Well, this town's
gonna drive her back

42:48.760 --> 42:50.990
to whatever hovel
she crawled out of.

42:51.100 --> 42:57.892
*

43:18.490 --> 43:24.599
*

43:24.700 --> 43:26.167
(phone buzzing)

43:29.000 --> 43:30.695
(phone buzzing)

43:33.310 --> 43:34.629
(phone beeps)

43:34.740 --> 43:37.038
-Hello?
-TONY (shakily): Teresa.

43:37.140 --> 43:38.846
Tony?

43:38.950 --> 43:40.099
(softly)
Someone's trying to kill me.

43:43.480 --> 43:44.640
Tony!

43:44.750 --> 43:46.718
(dramatic music)

43:46.820 --> 43:47.787
Tony!

44:07.170 --> 44:10.173
(keys clacking, bell dings)
