05:44.797 --> 05:47.438
In a hurry, aren't you?
What are you running for?

05:47.638 --> 05:49.678
You're covered in blood.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.558
How did you get covered
in all this blood?

06:04.878 --> 06:08.478
Now, the blood. Now, whose is it,
and where did it come from?

06:08.638 --> 06:09.998
Now, come on, come on.

06:11.398 --> 06:14.638
The old Herzeg house.
Outside town.

06:14.797 --> 06:17.518
Yes, yes, the Herzeg house.
Yes, yes.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.158
Cellar.

06:19.318 --> 06:22.078
A man in a glass case...

06:22.237 --> 06:23.878
Head...

06:24.037 --> 06:25.438
Head.

06:28.117 --> 06:29.958
What do you think you're doing?

06:30.117 --> 06:33.558
I'm sorry, sir. One of our men
found Dr. Heidecke in his doorway.

06:33.718 --> 06:35.198
His head's been cut off.

06:42.597 --> 06:46.118
- Do you see anything?
- No, sir. I can hear water though.

06:48.318 --> 06:52.398
Well, inspector, I'd say you
have the crime of the century.

06:52.917 --> 06:55.838
If that's what you want.

06:56.037 --> 06:58.678
I wouldn't like to have
to find the reasons for it.

06:58.838 --> 07:02.118
Well, whoever left this amount
of evidence is a fool.

07:02.477 --> 07:03.958
I'll soon find him.

07:04.117 --> 07:07.118
Inspector, I know doctors.
Very few of them are fools.

07:07.278 --> 07:09.558
Oh, so it was a doctor, was it?
Thank you.

07:09.718 --> 07:11.078
Doesn't it look like it?

07:11.237 --> 07:13.958
You can't buy equipment
of this kind over a counter.

07:14.117 --> 07:17.358
When I want your diagnosis,
I'll ask for it.

07:17.518 --> 07:18.918
Doctor.

07:19.078 --> 07:20.478
No one's been living here.

07:20.638 --> 07:23.038
There's some rotting furniture,
but that's all.

07:23.198 --> 07:24.358
Thank you, sergeant.

07:24.518 --> 07:28.038
Tomorrow I want your men to check
all suppliers of surgical goods...

07:28.198 --> 07:30.598
...laboratory equipment and drugs.
- Yes, sir.

07:30.758 --> 07:33.798
I want the names of all their
purchasers for the last year.

07:33.958 --> 07:36.798
- Yes, sir.
- And, sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

07:36.958 --> 07:40.998
I want the names of all...
Of all persons listed as missing.

07:41.158 --> 07:42.798
Yes, sir.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.918
The mortuary attendant, sir.

07:49.078 --> 07:50.718
All right.

07:52.677 --> 07:55.998
Now, I understand you've lost a body.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.198
Dr. Herman Streich, I believe.

08:01.357 --> 08:04.598
Can you tell me for certain
when he was last in there?

08:04.758 --> 08:06.518
On the day he was taken in there.

08:06.677 --> 08:10.558
We don't keep going back to look.
They're not expected to walk, are they?

08:10.718 --> 08:13.598
I advise you to be careful.
You have just lost a body.

08:13.758 --> 08:15.958
And that's no cause
for funny remarks.

08:16.117 --> 08:18.518
I last saw him when
I slid him into the drawer.

08:18.677 --> 08:22.278
Has anybody recently made inquiries
as to who you had lying in there?

08:22.437 --> 08:24.438
- No.
- You're sure?

08:24.597 --> 08:27.638
Not a man with a pockmarked face,
for instance. Think hard.

08:27.797 --> 08:32.038
No one. Not with pockmarks, warts,
pimples or hairs growing out of his nose.

08:32.197 --> 08:34.438
- We don't have visitors.
- Oh, get out!

08:35.197 --> 08:37.878
Give the duty sergeant
a statement on the way.

08:38.037 --> 08:39.878
Damn fool.

08:43.758 --> 08:47.398
Dr. Streich could've been
the body in the cellar, I suppose.

08:47.557 --> 08:48.998
Yes.

08:49.158 --> 08:51.038
Yes, it ties in, doesn't it?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.318
Yes, but why?
For what reason, eh?

08:53.478 --> 08:56.038
There's one absolute certainty.

08:56.197 --> 08:58.318
We are looking for a doctor.

08:58.478 --> 09:01.038
Nothing is absolutely certain
until it is proven.

09:01.197 --> 09:02.678
At the moment, I believe...

09:02.837 --> 09:06.718
...that we're looking for a mad
and highly dangerous medical adventurer.

09:06.878 --> 09:09.638
Whether it's a doctor or not
remains to be seen.

09:29.957 --> 09:31.718
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

09:31.878 --> 09:33.958
You are advertising
vacant accommodation?

09:34.118 --> 09:35.878
Yes, that's right.
Please come in.

09:36.037 --> 09:37.318
Thank you.

09:38.598 --> 09:41.318
- It's a cold evening, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed.

09:42.158 --> 09:44.398
I'll show you the rooms
that are available.

09:44.557 --> 09:45.838
That won't be necessary.

09:45.998 --> 09:48.358
I'm sure any of them
will suit me perfectly.

09:48.518 --> 09:51.558
- Well, if you'll sign the register.
- Of course.

09:59.278 --> 10:00.878
Thank you.

10:03.717 --> 10:05.798
Will you be staying long?

10:06.238 --> 10:07.878
Indefinitely.

10:12.557 --> 10:14.598
Thank you, Mr. Fenner.

10:14.758 --> 10:16.278
My name is Anna Spengler.

10:16.437 --> 10:18.358
- How do you do, Mrs. Spengler?
- Miss.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.998
- I beg your pardon.
- Now, may I show you to your room?

10:20.158 --> 10:22.998
Of course. Thank you.

10:23.158 --> 10:26.238
- Do you run this house alone?
- Yes, I'm afraid I do.

10:26.398 --> 10:29.318
That's quite a task, if I may say so,
for one so young.

10:29.478 --> 10:31.238
It belongs to my mother, really.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.198
- She's very old now, and she's retired.
- I see.

10:34.358 --> 10:37.638
I only have four other guests, so...

10:37.957 --> 10:39.998
...you'll find it very quiet here.

10:56.238 --> 11:00.078
- She really wailed that time, Dr. Holst.
- It's the worst she's ever been.

11:00.238 --> 11:02.598
- Spiders again?
- Yeah.

11:07.878 --> 11:09.678
Get on with it.

11:13.957 --> 11:16.118
Hold her legs still.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.638
You can take the jacket off
when she's asleep.

11:38.077 --> 11:40.558
Good evening, Professor Richter.

11:40.717 --> 11:41.958
Good evening, doctor.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.918
- How is she?
- Not at all good, sir.

11:44.077 --> 11:46.358
I've given her a few hours' sleep.

11:46.518 --> 11:49.478
And what is your opinion
of Dr. Brandt, sir?

11:58.557 --> 12:01.878
I sometimes wonder if we're
not all wasting our time.

12:04.278 --> 12:07.478
A man has an abscess,
we cut him open, see the abscess.

12:07.638 --> 12:09.958
But a sick brain...

12:10.358 --> 12:12.758
We open the skull,
all we can see is the brain.

12:12.917 --> 12:15.078
Of the sickness, there is no sign.

12:17.317 --> 12:21.638
I suggest you tell Mrs. Brandt there's
no point in continuing to visit her husband.

12:21.797 --> 12:24.838
It is my opinion
that he can never be cured.

12:25.158 --> 12:26.958
What a terrible waste.

12:27.598 --> 12:29.958
Madness is always sad.

12:30.878 --> 12:34.638
But for such a brilliant man
to drive himself mad...

12:35.758 --> 12:37.638
...what a terrible waste.

12:37.797 --> 12:39.878
A terrible, terrible waste.

12:53.118 --> 12:55.638
Not very talkative, our new resident.

12:55.797 --> 12:57.718
Damn surly, if you ask me.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.398
Only just about managed
to say good evening.

13:00.557 --> 13:02.318
My move, I think.

13:02.478 --> 13:04.358
Oh, yes.

13:16.197 --> 13:19.558
Dreadful business, this Dr. Heidecke
getting his head lopped off.

13:19.717 --> 13:21.798
The world's full of maniacs.

13:21.957 --> 13:26.278
Ever cross your mind that you never know
who you're standing next to in the street?

13:26.437 --> 13:27.998
Funny you should say that.

13:28.158 --> 13:32.878
Today I stood next to probably
the worst madman of the decade.

13:33.158 --> 13:35.958
- Who?
- Dr. Frederick Brandt.

13:37.278 --> 13:38.718
Remember him?

13:38.878 --> 13:40.878
Yes, I do.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.758
But where did you see him?
Not in the street, surely?

13:43.917 --> 13:48.598
Of course not. I had to call at the asylum
to discuss a new plumbing installation.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.678
I passed him in the exercise yard.

13:50.837 --> 13:53.118
Name rings a bell,
but I can't place it.

13:53.278 --> 13:57.478
He's the doctor who caused
an absolute furor in the medical world...

13:57.638 --> 13:59.558
...about five years ago with some...

13:59.717 --> 14:04.598
...fantastic and devilish notion he had
about transplanting people's brains.

14:04.998 --> 14:07.718
You know, putting them
from one person into another.

14:07.878 --> 14:12.878
And he claimed that anyone undergoing
such surgery could survive.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.038
Absolute claptrap.

14:16.598 --> 14:21.598
I seem to recall that another fellow
had the same idea at the same time.

14:21.797 --> 14:23.118
A foreigner.

14:23.278 --> 14:25.958
- Oh, dear. What was his name, now?
- Frankenstein.

14:26.118 --> 14:29.318
Baron Frankenstein. Lived in Bohemia.

14:29.478 --> 14:31.238
That's the one.

14:31.398 --> 14:34.278
They were both run out
of the medical profession, right?

14:34.437 --> 14:35.558
That's right.

14:35.717 --> 14:38.438
And Frankenstein was run
out of his country as well.

14:38.598 --> 14:40.998
The church, in particular,
pilloried him.

14:41.158 --> 14:43.398
The devil's disciples, the pair of them.

14:43.557 --> 14:49.678
Of course, it was the work that Brandt was
engaged on that sent him mad, you know.

14:49.837 --> 14:53.638
- Well, it must have been.
- Excuse me. I didn't know that you were doctors.

14:54.118 --> 14:56.558
- Doctors? We're not doctors.

14:56.717 --> 15:00.038
I beg your pardon. I thought you knew
what you were talking about.

15:00.197 --> 15:01.758
You're damn rude, sir.

15:01.917 --> 15:04.358
Stupidity always brings
out the worst in me.

15:04.518 --> 15:07.838
- Stupidity?
- Yes, stupidity.

15:09.077 --> 15:12.958
It is fools like you who have
blocked progress throughout the ages.

15:13.118 --> 15:16.478
You make pronouncements on half-facts
that you don't understand.

15:16.638 --> 15:19.438
I find your tone and manner
highly objectionable, sir.

15:19.598 --> 15:23.078
But if you wish to involve yourself
in an argument about it, pray...

15:23.238 --> 15:25.598
...explain the word "progress"
in this context.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.358
You wouldn't understand it.

15:27.518 --> 15:30.398
I will give you a parallel
that you may just appreciate.

15:30.557 --> 15:33.198
Had man not been given
to invention and experiment...

15:33.358 --> 15:36.078
...then tonight you would
have eaten dinner in a cave.

15:36.238 --> 15:38.678
You would've strewn the bones
about the floor...

15:38.837 --> 15:41.558
...then wiped your fingers
on a coat of animal skin.

15:41.717 --> 15:45.118
In fact, your lapels do look
somewhat greasy. Good night.

16:03.238 --> 16:05.998
- How was your day?
- Terrible.

16:07.238 --> 16:10.558
But a kiss and a drink
will help me forget all about it.

16:13.758 --> 16:15.998
- I think the drink can wait.

16:16.158 --> 16:20.198
- If you want to go to the theater tonight
you'd better have that drink.
- Come here.

16:27.077 --> 16:30.558
Anna, you're looking
very beautiful tonight.

16:30.717 --> 16:33.198
- Thank you, Dr. Holst.
- So let's put the tickets on the fire.

16:33.358 --> 16:36.198
Karl, it took me two hours
to get ready this evening.

16:36.358 --> 16:39.118
And I would like to go to the theater.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.398
- I'll get you that drink.
- Right.

16:42.758 --> 16:45.918
Darling, I had a letter
from Mother this morning.

16:46.077 --> 16:48.478
She sounds so much better,
I can't believe it.

16:48.638 --> 16:51.838
Darling, I've told you before
not to set your hopes too high.

16:51.998 --> 16:55.158
As yet, there's no cure for her,
just temporary relief.

16:55.317 --> 16:56.798
I know.

16:56.957 --> 16:59.398
I heard from the hospital treasurer
as well.

16:59.557 --> 17:02.118
The fees are going up again.

17:02.878 --> 17:05.478
It's... It's dreadful that you
have to buy a life.

17:05.637 --> 17:06.998
Yes.

17:07.157 --> 17:11.678
So long as nerve specialists are in short
supply, we'll have to pay a high price.

17:11.838 --> 17:15.798
- Luckily for us, that's no problem.
- But I worry in case you're discovered.

17:15.957 --> 17:19.637
- It's dangerous, isn't it?
- It isn't dangerous, darling. I promise you.

17:19.798 --> 17:23.397
I've been getting away with it for a year,
so stop worrying about it.

17:23.717 --> 17:26.397
- But if you're caught...
- I won't get caught.

17:26.558 --> 17:31.158
I'm in charge of the drugs department,
I add a figure here, subtract one there.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.198
It's all right, Anna. Really.

17:36.757 --> 17:40.278
It's the only way to get the money
to keep your mother where she is.

17:40.437 --> 17:44.038
The illegal drug market is one source
where money never dries up.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.198
Lock this packet in a bureau,
Anna, will you?

17:47.358 --> 17:50.118
There's no point in taking
it to the theater.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.198
Where the devil is it?

17:54.798 --> 17:57.478
- Where did I take my coat off?
- On the doorstep.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.718
It must have fallen out there,
or in the hall.

18:03.838 --> 18:06.678
Good evening.
I found this on the doorstep.

18:06.838 --> 18:09.798
It appears to have come
from the Holburg Mental Hospital.

18:09.957 --> 18:13.478
- Would it belong to anyone in the house?
- Yes, thank you. It's mine.

18:13.638 --> 18:18.038
Good evening, Mr. Fenner.
This is my fiancé, Dr. Karl Holst.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.838
How do you do?
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:20.997 --> 18:22.398
How do you do?

18:22.558 --> 18:25.278
- The box, please.
- Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.958
- It's cocaine. Isn't it?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

18:30.118 --> 18:34.118
We've tickets for the theater this evening,
and we're already a little late.

18:34.277 --> 18:36.998
- Do you work at the asylum?
- Yes, I do. Now, if you...

18:37.158 --> 18:41.318
Dedicated men, mental health doctors.
Not a very pleasant job, I should imagine.

18:41.477 --> 18:44.038
It isn't. Get your coat, Anna.
We'd better go.

18:44.197 --> 18:48.238
I trust your mother
is not too ill, Miss Spengler.

18:49.318 --> 18:53.998
Doctor, is the Hippocratic oath
no longer taken in the profession?

18:54.158 --> 18:56.158
- What do you mean?
- What I said.

18:56.318 --> 18:58.478
- Of course it's still taken.
- Oh, I see.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.998
Then I fancy you do not number
yourself among the dedicated men?

19:02.158 --> 19:08.478
Mr. Fenner, forgive me, but I can't stand here
all night talking gibberish with you.
- Come along, Anna.

19:09.838 --> 19:12.198
- Neither of you are going anywhere tonight.

19:12.358 --> 19:15.238
- How dare you? What right...?
- I have every right.

19:15.398 --> 19:18.478
You're both engaged
in highly illegal business.

19:18.638 --> 19:20.518
Illegal business?
What do you mean?

19:20.677 --> 19:24.198
Come now, Miss Spengler.
You know what I'm talking about.

19:24.358 --> 19:28.198
All right, so you overheard
a conversation. Prove it.

19:28.757 --> 19:31.558
The Narcotics Bureau
would prove it in no time at all.

19:31.717 --> 19:37.198
It's uncanny how they discover
irregularities in their record books.
Haven't you noticed?

19:37.358 --> 19:38.558
What do you want?

19:38.717 --> 19:42.798
The penalties for drug trafficking
in this country are the harshest in Europe.

19:42.957 --> 19:45.838
As a medical man,
you would get not less than 20 years.

19:45.997 --> 19:49.318
And you, my dear Miss Spengler,
would get at least 10.

19:49.477 --> 19:53.638
Can you imagine what you would
look like after 10 years in prison?

19:53.798 --> 19:56.038
I'm sure you can, doctor.

19:56.358 --> 20:00.358
- How much do you want?
- Oh, I want no money. I want your help.

20:00.517 --> 20:02.878
What sort of help, for God's sake?

20:03.038 --> 20:07.518
Don't invoke the Almighty. I should think
he's very angry with you at the moment.

20:07.677 --> 20:08.918
Sit down.

20:08.997 --> 20:12.038
Both of you,
and listen to what I have to say.

20:13.277 --> 20:16.518
I can tell you if there was
an official body to complain to...

20:16.677 --> 20:18.798
...I would have you closed down.

20:18.957 --> 20:21.918
We've lived here long enough
to regard the place as home.

20:22.078 --> 20:26.238
To be thrown into the street without
reasonable warning is utterly disgraceful.

20:26.398 --> 20:31.198
And I think in our own small way,
we've been very kind to you over the years.

20:31.358 --> 20:33.358
This is an appalling way to treat us.

20:33.517 --> 20:37.278
It makes a mockery of all trust
and standards of decency.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.198
Goodbye.

20:39.517 --> 20:42.678
Thank you, Anna.
Thank you very much.

20:58.878 --> 21:01.078
You sent for me, inspector?

21:01.237 --> 21:02.598
Yes, pack your bag.

21:02.757 --> 21:05.438
You're going up to Altenburg
for a while.

21:05.638 --> 21:08.158
- With you?
- Yes, with me.

21:08.318 --> 21:09.638
For how long?

21:09.798 --> 21:12.358
Until I say we come back.

21:12.517 --> 21:15.038
Might I be permitted
to ask why we're going?

21:15.197 --> 21:16.438
Yes, you read that.

21:16.598 --> 21:20.438
In the Altenburg area, there've been
four robberies in the last two weeks.

21:20.598 --> 21:23.918
All from manufacturers of surgical
or laboratory equipment.

21:24.078 --> 21:25.958
And enough stuff has been taken...

21:26.118 --> 21:31.558
...to equip something very similar
to what we saw in that cellar.

22:32.638 --> 22:34.718
You've killed him, doctor.

22:45.318 --> 22:47.238
Please, tell me!

22:47.398 --> 22:49.438
What happened tonight?

22:51.437 --> 22:52.758
Tell me.

22:52.917 --> 22:55.678
Karl hasn't spoken since you got back.

22:55.957 --> 22:59.078
- What's wrong with him?
- Why don't you ask him.

23:10.437 --> 23:11.678
Karl.

23:12.118 --> 23:14.198
Don't sit here like this.

23:14.798 --> 23:16.558
Say something.

23:17.558 --> 23:19.078
Please.

23:20.197 --> 23:22.758
I killed a man tonight, Anna.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.958
I killed the night watchman.

23:28.038 --> 23:29.598
I didn't mean to.

23:29.757 --> 23:31.958
Oh, God, I didn't mean to.

23:32.118 --> 23:33.958
I panicked.

23:35.717 --> 23:38.758
Anna, I want you
to go away from here.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.398
- You must leave this house tonight.
- Not unless we go together.

23:42.558 --> 23:44.438
We can't go together.

23:44.598 --> 23:47.038
He'll put the police onto us at once.

23:47.197 --> 23:52.358
He says he needs me,
and after what I've done tonight
he has me completely trapped.

23:52.517 --> 23:54.038
But he doesn't need you.

23:54.197 --> 23:56.678
- You must get away from here tonight.
- No.

23:57.078 --> 23:58.798
Anna, my love...

23:59.118 --> 24:02.918
...if we get caught, you'll go to prison
for the rest of your life.

24:03.078 --> 24:05.238
Don't you realize the position you're in?

24:05.398 --> 24:08.758
You're harboring a murderer
and an accessory to murder.

24:09.358 --> 24:12.358
I won't go without you, Karl.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.918
I'm as much to blame
for all this as you are.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.838
It's my fault you took the drugs.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.558
Even if we escape
the consequences of this...

24:19.717 --> 24:22.438
...there's no longer any future
for you and me, Anna.

24:22.598 --> 24:23.838
I'm a murderer.

24:25.717 --> 24:28.878
I'm not leaving you, Karl.
No matter what happens.

24:29.038 --> 24:31.158
Such loyalty is most touching.

24:34.197 --> 24:37.158
The plan, Karl.
I trust you didn't forget it.

24:38.437 --> 24:40.158
Who are you?

24:41.398 --> 24:42.878
Did you get the plan?

24:43.038 --> 24:45.758
I'll do no more until you tell me
who you really are.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.758
What you're involved in.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.478
Stay where you are.

24:50.677 --> 24:53.158
I am Baron Frankenstein.

24:53.318 --> 24:55.438
Frankenstein.

24:55.598 --> 24:57.918
I thought the world
had seen the last of you.

24:58.078 --> 24:59.718
So did a lot of other people.

24:59.878 --> 25:03.558
I have work to do, and you will
both give me every assistance.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.318
The plan. Where is it?

25:06.717 --> 25:10.438
- In that case on the table.
- Thank you.

25:17.318 --> 25:19.718
Show me Dr. Brandt's cell.

25:22.237 --> 25:26.198
Well, it's here,
but he's a raving madman.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.958
- What do you want with him?
- I intend to get him out, with your help.

25:30.118 --> 25:32.518
Then I shall cure his insanity.

25:32.838 --> 25:35.558
You're as mad as he is.
It's utterly impossible.

25:35.717 --> 25:38.678
Your medical education
is soon to be vastly improved.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.838
I tell you, it isn't possible.

25:40.997 --> 25:44.598
We had Professor Richter see Brandt
and he says he's a hopeless case.

25:44.757 --> 25:47.758
You can take whatever Richter
says as an absolute fact.

25:47.917 --> 25:51.678
Richter. Yes, he's a clever man,
up to a point.

25:51.838 --> 25:53.798
But he's not progressive.

25:53.957 --> 25:58.518
You mean you're going to bring
a madman to this house and operate on him?

25:58.677 --> 26:01.718
Anna, go and make
us some coffee, please.

26:01.878 --> 26:06.878
- You don't need her. Let her go.
- I need her to make coffee. Anna.

26:12.757 --> 26:16.358
- Now, explain the layout of the asylum.
- You're wasting your time.

26:16.517 --> 26:18.998
- You'll never get him out.
- Of course I will.

26:19.158 --> 26:21.398
Remember what happens to you...

26:21.558 --> 26:24.318
...and Anna if I don't.

26:25.957 --> 26:29.838
I find it very hard to accept
that there's no hope.

26:29.997 --> 26:31.878
No hope at all?

26:32.038 --> 26:36.358
I most sincerely wish there was better
news I could give you, Mrs. Brandt.

26:36.517 --> 26:39.358
But I think it best
that you should know the truth.

26:40.398 --> 26:41.958
- Truth?
- Yes.

26:42.118 --> 26:46.198
For the last three months, we've had
to take the precaution of sedating him...

26:46.358 --> 26:48.398
...every time you came to visit him.

26:48.558 --> 26:52.718
He's suddenly developed
the most violent and murderous rages.

26:53.598 --> 26:55.198
He's drugged at this moment.

26:55.638 --> 26:58.598
And his condition does nothing
but deteriorate.

26:58.757 --> 27:00.358
We fear...

27:00.517 --> 27:03.518
...that there is nothing more
we can do for him.

27:03.677 --> 27:04.918
Are you sure?

27:05.078 --> 27:07.358
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Absolutely.

27:07.517 --> 27:09.958
And I'm going to suggest
to you, Mrs. Brandt...

27:10.118 --> 27:12.238
...that you cease to visit him.

27:15.997 --> 27:19.118
For you, it can only be
terribly, terribly painful.

27:19.277 --> 27:21.638
And as for Dr. Brandt...

27:21.838 --> 27:24.918
...he doesn't even know
that you're in the room with him.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.478
I couldn't do that.

27:29.638 --> 27:31.478
I couldn't just walk away.

27:31.638 --> 27:34.918
Well, I won't press the point,
but I do ask you to consider it.

27:35.078 --> 27:37.158
It can only be upsetting.

27:37.638 --> 27:39.238
Come.

27:53.398 --> 27:56.438
There's a woman in cell six
who thinks she sees spiders.

27:56.598 --> 27:58.998
When she does, her screams
will wake the dead.

27:59.158 --> 28:01.878
See that she's under sedation
the night we go there.

28:02.038 --> 28:05.318
I can't guarantee that.
I don't make out the duty roster.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.998
Then find some way to alter it.

28:08.158 --> 28:10.278
Why are you doing all this?

28:11.598 --> 28:14.278
Brandt has a secret that I must know.

28:14.437 --> 28:17.718
In order to learn that secret...

28:17.878 --> 28:18.918
...I must cure his insanity.
- What secret?

28:19.078 --> 28:22.718
We were involved in the problems
of transplanting the human brain.

28:22.878 --> 28:24.358
We both achieved it.

28:24.517 --> 28:26.518
Utterly impossible.

28:26.917 --> 28:28.558
I assure you, it isn't.

28:28.717 --> 28:32.358
We both found a way of making
a transplant from one body to another.

28:32.517 --> 28:34.278
We corresponded on the subject.

28:34.437 --> 28:37.158
Our next step was to find a way of freezing
brains without destroying the living cells...

28:37.318 --> 28:41.398
...so they could be stored
for future use.

28:41.558 --> 28:45.318
My research went badly,
but Brandt discovered the technique.

28:46.757 --> 28:47.998
He wrote to me.

28:48.158 --> 28:51.998
And we arranged to meet for the first time.
He was to tell me the secret.

28:52.158 --> 28:55.798
Unfortunately, two days before
we were to meet, he went mad.

28:55.957 --> 28:58.158
The pressure of his work had broken him.

28:58.318 --> 28:59.878
He disappeared.

29:00.158 --> 29:03.238
Shortly afterwards,
I was hounded out of the country.

29:03.398 --> 29:04.678
It's horrifying.

29:05.318 --> 29:07.638
But it doesn't explain
why you were doing it.

29:09.757 --> 29:14.518
We were seeking to preserve for all time
the great talents and geniuses of the world.

29:14.677 --> 29:18.358
When they die, their brains are at
the height of their creative power.

29:18.517 --> 29:22.678
And we bury them underground to rot
because the bodies that house them
have worn out.

29:22.838 --> 29:25.798
We want to remove those brains at the instant
of death and freeze them...

29:25.957 --> 29:30.438
...thus preserving
for posterity all they contain.

29:32.358 --> 29:33.638
It's frightening.

29:33.798 --> 29:38.118
I shall need Brandt's case history.
Get it for me. Good night.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.038
I beg you.

29:40.997 --> 29:45.158
- Let Anna go.
- Perhaps, when my work is finished.

29:45.318 --> 29:47.958
Thank you for the coffee, Anna.

29:54.398 --> 29:57.478
Yes, all right, all right.
Take him away. Take him away.

30:02.118 --> 30:03.638
Here.
What's been taken?

30:03.798 --> 30:07.838
Surgical knives of various kinds,
saws, hypodermic syringes and the like.

30:07.997 --> 30:10.558
- Yeah.
- I'd say for certain, your man is a doctor.

30:10.717 --> 30:14.798
Oh, would you really? I'd be most surprised
if you tell me what he looks like.

30:14.957 --> 30:17.678
- How tall he is and his weight.
- I'm sorry. I think...

30:17.838 --> 30:20.878
Look, I do the thinking.
You check the stores.

30:22.118 --> 30:25.558
You'd be well-advised to get
younger men to patrol these premises.

30:25.717 --> 30:27.878
That last old chap was 70
if he was a day.

30:28.398 --> 30:30.678
Well, what about this knife wound?

30:30.838 --> 30:34.758
Well, whoever did this knew exactly
where he was putting the knife.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.238
- Oh, yes.
- Too exactly to be lucky, I think.

30:37.398 --> 30:38.638
Yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

30:38.798 --> 30:43.598
We better start by making a tour of all the
derelict and empty properties in this area.

30:44.078 --> 30:46.718
Well, come on.
Come on. Come on.

30:47.398 --> 30:49.718
- Which door, doctor?
- Six.

31:22.038 --> 31:23.398
Dr. Holst!

31:23.878 --> 31:26.238
What the devil do you think
you're doing?

31:26.757 --> 31:30.278
I'm putting her under sedation, sir.
She's been having a bad time lately.

31:30.437 --> 31:31.998
I had noticed that, doctor.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.878
I will tell you when to give patients
extra sedation.

31:35.398 --> 31:39.638
Inexperience I can excuse,
but lack of basic procedure I cannot.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.638
Now, come out of there.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.958
I couldn't sedate her.
The principal caught me in her cell.

32:03.118 --> 32:05.518
Then we'll just have to trust to luck.

34:21.118 --> 34:23.878
Be careful, now.
He can turn savage in a second.

34:24.038 --> 34:26.358
He doesn't like injections.

34:41.158 --> 34:44.958
Don't be afraid, Dr. Brandt.
We're not going to hurt you.

34:55.877 --> 34:59.278
There. Don't be afraid.

34:59.438 --> 35:01.078
No!

35:07.118 --> 35:10.038
- Just relax.
- Watch it!

35:19.757 --> 35:22.438
Hold him! Hold him!

35:25.638 --> 35:28.318
- Hold him. Back in you go!
- I've got him!

35:29.958 --> 35:32.678
Hold him! Hold him!

35:44.237 --> 35:45.798
Hurry.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.758
The dogs, Frankenstein!
They'll get the dogs!

37:16.357 --> 37:17.958
Anna.

37:24.558 --> 37:26.798
- Karl.
- I must get back.

37:37.478 --> 37:39.558
You haven't finished!

37:49.478 --> 37:54.198
Now, Mrs. Brandt, there is a most
worrying aspect about all this, you know.

37:54.357 --> 37:57.438
Your husband did not escape
from the asylum.

37:57.598 --> 37:59.558
He was taken out.

37:59.717 --> 38:02.278
- Taken out?
- Removed.

38:02.438 --> 38:05.998
Somebody removed him from his cell.

38:06.797 --> 38:08.478
How is that possible, inspector?

38:08.638 --> 38:11.678
Now, Mrs. Brandt, I can lay before you
the absolute facts.

38:11.837 --> 38:16.238
But we shall proceed more quickly
if you'll take my word for it.

38:16.397 --> 38:20.438
Who'd want to do such a dreadful thing?
And for what reason?

38:20.598 --> 38:25.278
Now, at the asylum we learned
that your husband was a doctor...

38:25.438 --> 38:30.598
...who achieved a certain notoriety
about five years ago.

38:30.757 --> 38:36.038
- Yes.
- In the line of researchhe was engaged
upon, he had a collaborator.

38:36.197 --> 38:37.638
A Baron Frankenstein.

38:38.598 --> 38:40.518
That is correct.

38:40.717 --> 38:45.238
Oh, inspector, I've often believed
that it was he who drove Frederick mad.

38:45.478 --> 38:47.718
- My God! You don't think he...?
- Mrs. Brandt.

38:47.877 --> 38:50.998
Don't tell me what I am thinking.
Listen to what I'm saying.

38:51.158 --> 38:53.758
- And please answer my questions.
- Inspector.

38:53.918 --> 38:55.438
Now...

38:55.837 --> 38:58.558
...in connection with other inquiries
we're making...

38:58.717 --> 39:01.758
...I would very much like to meet
this Baron Frankenstein.

39:01.918 --> 39:04.158
Or at least to discover what he looks like.

39:04.317 --> 39:07.158
Now, do you know his whereabouts?

39:07.317 --> 39:10.038
And did you ever meet him?

39:11.797 --> 39:15.078
Mrs. Brandt, I am asking you,
did you ever meet him?

39:15.237 --> 39:16.998
Do you know where he is?

39:19.717 --> 39:22.878
No... no.

39:23.038 --> 39:26.438
Thank you, Mrs. Brandt.
I will keep you informed.

39:53.757 --> 39:55.638
- You're late.
- I couldn't get away.

39:55.797 --> 39:58.838
The police have been there all day.
They know he was taken.

39:58.998 --> 40:01.718
They're pretty sure someone inside
must have helped.

40:02.038 --> 40:04.398
They're not utter fools.

40:04.877 --> 40:07.078
Our friend is in trouble.

40:15.317 --> 40:18.278
- He's had a very severe heart attack.
- I'm not surprised.

40:18.438 --> 40:21.798
I massaged the heart. He won't live
more than two or three days.

40:21.958 --> 40:25.398
If I operate on him in his present condition,
he'll die instantly.

40:25.558 --> 40:27.878
Then it's all been a waste of time.

40:28.118 --> 40:30.198
- It's over, isn't it?
- Not in the least.

40:30.357 --> 40:32.158
Just made things more difficult.

40:32.317 --> 40:34.238
But there's nothing you can do now.

40:34.397 --> 40:37.278
On the contrary, I can transplant his brain.

40:37.438 --> 40:40.158
If I don't, it'll die through lack of oxygen.

40:40.317 --> 40:43.878
I must therefore transfer it
to a healthy body to keep it alive.

40:44.038 --> 40:47.398
When the recipient has fully recovered,
I shall operate again...

40:47.558 --> 40:49.478
...to cure the insanity.

40:49.638 --> 40:53.678
You can't mean any of that. You can't.
- I mean every word of it.

40:53.837 --> 40:57.518
But that would mean you'd have to remove
someone else's brain to do it.

40:57.677 --> 40:59.758
Of course, Karl. How else?

40:59.918 --> 41:01.958
But that would be murder!

41:02.118 --> 41:05.518
You're used to that by now.
Aren't you?

41:07.958 --> 41:11.918
Remember, Dr. Knox had Burke
and Hare to assist him.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.398
Think what they did for surgery
between them.

41:14.558 --> 41:16.678
Now, I have you.

41:17.357 --> 41:21.038
If I were to put Dr. Brandt's brain
in the body of another surgeon...

41:21.197 --> 41:25.598
...he'd be the living proof
of everything we were striving for.

41:27.638 --> 41:29.158
Karl...

41:29.317 --> 41:32.798
...Professor Richter would be ideal.

43:06.118 --> 43:07.718
Anna!

43:08.237 --> 43:11.078
It's me, Karl.

43:17.837 --> 43:20.118
- Who is it, Karl?
- Anna!

43:20.277 --> 43:23.798
- What are you doing out here?
- I came down for some fresh air.

43:23.958 --> 43:27.118
- I saw the light on and I came...
- Go back to bed.

43:27.958 --> 43:30.358
Go to bed, Anna!

43:33.478 --> 43:36.198
You must get back to the asylum.
Everything's ready.

43:36.357 --> 43:39.638
Help me carry him down first.
Come on.

43:55.717 --> 43:57.398
Karl?

44:03.078 --> 44:06.438
- Where's Karl?
- He's gone back to work...

44:06.598 --> 44:07.838
...at the asylum.

44:08.518 --> 44:10.598
We've done everything you asked.

44:10.757 --> 44:12.678
Please leave my room.

44:29.797 --> 44:31.358
Give me that key.

45:03.397 --> 45:05.118
No!

45:05.877 --> 45:09.078
No! No!

45:20.598 --> 45:22.798
No!

45:36.998 --> 45:38.278
No.

45:38.757 --> 45:39.998
Gentlemen...

45:40.078 --> 45:43.758
...Professor Richter has been
forcibly removed from his home.

45:43.918 --> 45:45.878
It happened last night.

45:46.038 --> 45:49.518
Now, if I might be allowed to finish!

45:49.677 --> 45:51.398
Thank you.

45:51.558 --> 45:56.478
Now, I have reasons for believing
that he is in very great danger.

45:56.638 --> 46:02.558
I also have reasons for wishing that the
matter receives no publicity in the press.

46:02.717 --> 46:06.518
Now, if you cannot guarantee
your cooperation...

46:06.677 --> 46:12.358
...then I should be obliged to take out
an enforcement order against
your newspapers.

46:12.518 --> 46:17.038
Now, I want no speculation
on what the police may be doing.

46:17.197 --> 46:20.198
And more important, I want no comment...

46:20.357 --> 46:23.838
...on what, in fact, I am going to do.

47:12.998 --> 47:14.998
Put the towels there.

47:23.998 --> 47:25.838
Ready, Karl?

48:06.277 --> 48:08.158
Concentrate.

48:08.797 --> 48:11.758
Hold his head. Rigid.

48:13.237 --> 48:14.878
Lower.

48:51.837 --> 48:55.198
All right, same procedure as before.

48:55.357 --> 48:57.998
Speed is essential.

49:06.797 --> 49:08.478
Good night!

49:35.797 --> 49:37.518
Quickly.

49:47.918 --> 49:50.558
Utterly fantastic.

49:50.918 --> 49:53.758
Not fantastic, Karl, advanced.

49:53.918 --> 49:57.798
The transplanting of all human organs
is a logical branch of surgery.

49:57.958 --> 50:03.198
But you and your pigheaded
contemporaries refuse to recognize the fact.

50:04.277 --> 50:06.878
And now we must bury Brandt's body.

50:23.958 --> 50:26.198
I shall be down for breakfast
at 6:30, Anna.

50:26.357 --> 50:29.398
I should like two lightly boiled eggs.

50:51.397 --> 50:53.398
I don't know what they're looking for.

50:53.558 --> 50:55.998
They've been to all the houses in my street.

51:01.118 --> 51:04.438
The police, they're searching
all the houses.

51:04.638 --> 51:07.998
This one's a boarding house,
Miss Anna Spengler.

51:14.438 --> 51:16.078
- Miss Spengler?
- Yes.

51:16.277 --> 51:19.478
We have authority to search your premises.
May we come in?

51:19.638 --> 51:23.318
- What are you looking for?
- Can't tell you that, miss.

51:23.478 --> 51:26.158
- Please.
- Very well.

51:27.158 --> 51:29.478
You've come at an awkward moment,
I'm afraid.

51:29.638 --> 51:31.918
I'm having the hall redecorated.

51:32.277 --> 51:35.518
You take the upstairs,
you, Keller, take the garden.

51:46.877 --> 51:49.318
- How many people staying here, miss?
- Only one.

51:49.478 --> 51:52.918
A Mr. Fenner.
He's out at the moment.

51:53.078 --> 51:54.758
I see.

51:55.397 --> 51:57.718
I'll look around down here.

52:32.478 --> 52:34.478
Dr. Holst?

52:35.118 --> 52:36.598
Oh, Sergeant Brenner.

52:37.558 --> 52:40.358
What are you fellows doing
crawling all over the town?

52:40.518 --> 52:42.558
Can't tell you that, sir.

52:48.797 --> 52:50.838
Bit out of your line, isn't it?

52:51.357 --> 52:53.358
Yes, it is a bit.

52:54.478 --> 52:57.918
I've got a couple of days off.
I'm just helping out my fiancée.

53:22.837 --> 53:24.758
Nothing out there, sergeant.

53:24.918 --> 53:27.078
All right. Wait outside.

53:52.438 --> 53:56.798
- Isn't there a cellar in this house, miss?
- A cellar? No, I don't have a cellar.

53:56.958 --> 54:01.438
I have to put all the junk in the garden shed.
You can hardly get in it.

54:14.317 --> 54:16.398
Nothing up there, sergeant.

54:20.998 --> 54:22.598
Thank you.

54:28.638 --> 54:30.798
He's a better doctor
than he is a painter.

54:56.757 --> 55:00.398
Yes, he's mending nicely.

55:00.757 --> 55:05.398
The insanity was caused by pressure
on the motor area of the brain.

55:05.558 --> 55:07.558
That pressure must be removed.

55:07.717 --> 55:11.958
And the cells that have been damaged
must be destroyed.

55:17.317 --> 55:18.918
Back.

55:19.438 --> 55:21.078
Heart.

55:31.038 --> 55:32.838
Hold his head.

56:16.158 --> 56:18.278
This must be held still.

56:18.438 --> 56:21.158
Absolutely still.

56:51.518 --> 56:53.158
Right.

57:09.918 --> 57:13.158
See to the dressings and bandage him.

57:14.357 --> 57:15.798
In two days...

57:15.958 --> 57:18.598
...I shall wake him just enough
to elicit response.

57:18.757 --> 57:19.998
If I'm satisfied...

57:20.158 --> 57:22.998
...then for you it's all over.

57:23.158 --> 57:25.278
He'll have to rest for a short time.

57:25.438 --> 57:27.758
Then I shall take him away.

57:28.598 --> 57:32.198
Ella, why don't you take a holiday?

57:32.357 --> 57:35.318
But you've been under
so much strain lately.

57:35.478 --> 57:38.318
- A change would do you good.
- I couldn't.

57:38.478 --> 57:42.998
Someone has taken my husband away.
I wouldn't have a moment's peace un...

57:45.757 --> 57:47.878
Something wrong, Ella?

57:48.038 --> 57:50.598
That man over there
buying a buttonhole...

57:50.757 --> 57:53.398
...I seem to know his face.

58:06.438 --> 58:08.758
Hello, Anna. Lovely day.
I'm going shopping.

58:08.918 --> 58:12.278
- Is there anything you want me to get?
- No, thank you very much.

58:17.118 --> 58:19.238
My goodness! A main's burst.

58:19.397 --> 58:22.278
I'll go to the Water Board
and get some help.

59:14.277 --> 59:16.198
They'll be here soon.

59:19.397 --> 59:21.918
Anna! Anna, are you all right?
You look...

59:22.078 --> 59:23.478
Go away!

59:23.638 --> 59:27.558
For God's sake, go away!
Leave me alone!

59:28.757 --> 59:31.798
I'll help you again, young lady.

01:00:14.837 --> 01:00:17.358
- What happened?
- Oh, water main broke, sir.

01:00:17.518 --> 01:00:20.238
- Devil of a mess, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed, sir.

01:00:20.397 --> 01:00:22.758
It'll soon be done.
We've capped the hole.

01:00:22.918 --> 01:00:27.438
It's happening all the time. Old pipes, you see.
- Ruined my plants.

01:00:27.598 --> 01:00:32.398
There's nothing more to be
seen here. I'm sure you have your own
affairs to attend to. Excuse me.

01:00:41.438 --> 01:00:43.358
Christina.

01:00:44.677 --> 01:00:46.278
Look.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:54.718
Well, I suppose it could be, Ella.

01:00:54.877 --> 01:00:57.558
There's certainly a likeness.

01:00:59.038 --> 01:01:02.598
Yes. Yes, it could be.

01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:06.038
This will restore him
to minimum consciousness.

01:01:06.197 --> 01:01:08.758
I only want him to respond.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.838
Can you hear me?

01:01:16.998 --> 01:01:19.718
If you can, raise your hand.

01:01:30.638 --> 01:01:33.678
Answer me each time
by raising your hand.

01:01:33.837 --> 01:01:38.318
You are Dr. Frederick Brandt,
are you not?

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:48.198
I am Baron Frankenstein.

01:01:48.357 --> 01:01:50.918
Do you remember the name?

01:02:05.397 --> 01:02:07.878
Good evening.
Are you the owner of this house?

01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:09.278
I am.

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:12.798
Could you tell me,
is Baron Frankenstein staying here?

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:16.318
- There's no one here of that name.
- Please, don't close the door.

01:02:16.478 --> 01:02:19.078
Well, you see, he might be
using another name.

01:02:19.237 --> 01:02:21.878
Please listen!
My name is Mrs. Frederick Brandt.

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:24.318
My dear Mrs. Brandt,
how nice to meet you.

01:02:24.478 --> 01:02:28.598
It was my intention to call on you,
but you have saved me a journey. Please.

01:02:34.397 --> 01:02:37.958
I am Baron Frankenstein.
I beg you not to be afraid.

01:02:38.118 --> 01:02:39.558
- Your husband is here.
- Here?

01:02:39.717 --> 01:02:42.118
Yes, and he is safe.
You will see him shortly.

01:02:42.277 --> 01:02:46.358
I'm sorry I had to take matters
into my own hands, but I had no choice.

01:02:46.518 --> 01:02:48.518
It was the only way I could save him.

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:51.358
Save him? What do you mean?

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:55.278
- Where is he?
- Now, please, let me explain.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:58.118
Had I come to you
and asked for your permission...

01:02:58.277 --> 01:03:01.558
...to have him removed
from the asylum and put under my care...

01:03:01.717 --> 01:03:04.038
...I do not think you
would have granted it.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:07.558
And under the circumstances,
that would have been understandable.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:11.158
But once I discovered where he was,
I could not leave him there...

01:03:11.317 --> 01:03:13.838
...when I knew it was in my power
to help him.

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:15.358
Help him?

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:19.238
When it was you who drove him
out of his mind.

01:03:19.397 --> 01:03:22.478
Even now, you can't
leave him in peace.

01:03:22.638 --> 01:03:25.798
Where is he?
What have you done to him?

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:29.798
He is downstairs. He is sane.

01:03:31.197 --> 01:03:34.918
- Sane?
- Come, let me show you.

01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:10.998
Please don't be frightened
at what you see.

01:04:11.158 --> 01:04:13.838
The apparatus is merely a method
of feeding him...

01:04:13.998 --> 01:04:17.598
...until he is capable of taking
nourishment in the normal way.

01:04:30.197 --> 01:04:35.398
- God, what have you done to him?
- He is simply asleep. Asleep and sane.

01:04:35.558 --> 01:04:37.918
- He is cured.
- But that's impossible.

01:04:38.078 --> 01:04:40.558
- Mrs. Brandt.
- What have you done to him?

01:04:40.717 --> 01:04:44.438
Do you think I'd allow you to see
this if I were not telling the truth?

01:04:44.518 --> 01:04:45.798
Let me go!

01:04:47.438 --> 01:04:50.558
Oh, help me! In the name of God,
somebody help me!

01:04:50.717 --> 01:04:54.398
There is no one in the world
who can help you, except me.

01:04:54.998 --> 01:04:56.678
And that I have done.

01:05:07.797 --> 01:05:12.158
What did they tell you at the asylum
about your husband's condition?

01:05:13.158 --> 01:05:17.958
- They said there was no hope for him.
- Yes, and they are the very same people...

01:05:18.118 --> 01:05:20.358
...who said your husband and I
were evil...

01:05:20.518 --> 01:05:23.238
...because they didn't understand
what we were doing.

01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:27.278
They did not wish to understand,
and so they condemned us both.

01:05:27.438 --> 01:05:29.038
They pilloried your husband...

01:05:29.197 --> 01:05:31.518
...and declared to the world
that he was mad.

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:35.438
And at last, they drove him mad.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:39.878
Now, when he was ill,
how much did he remember?

01:05:40.038 --> 01:05:41.878
Nothing.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:45.918
Nothing at all.
His whole past life had disappeared.

01:05:46.078 --> 01:05:49.558
Come with me. Please.

01:05:57.598 --> 01:06:00.398
Watch his left hand.

01:06:02.837 --> 01:06:05.638
Use your left hand to answer me.

01:06:05.797 --> 01:06:08.558
You are Dr. Frederick Brandt?

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:16.518
- Why is he covered? May I not see him?
- Not yet.

01:06:16.677 --> 01:06:18.918
The scars of his operation have not healed.

01:06:19.078 --> 01:06:21.758
I'd rather you waited until they have.

01:06:22.837 --> 01:06:26.918
Your Christian name is Ella, I believe.

01:06:29.478 --> 01:06:34.238
Brandt, your wife's name is Lily,
isn't it?

01:06:39.277 --> 01:06:41.518
Is it Ella?

01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:45.158
Is your wife's name Ella?

01:06:50.277 --> 01:06:53.678
He's just on the edge
of consciousness and cannot speak.

01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:57.358
Ask him any question you wish
very softly...

01:06:57.518 --> 01:06:59.598
...and watch his left hand.

01:07:04.197 --> 01:07:09.478
Frederick, do you recognize
this voice?

01:07:10.118 --> 01:07:12.998
Is it the voice of your wife?

01:07:20.038 --> 01:07:22.998
The color of my hair...

01:07:23.158 --> 01:07:25.198
...is it black?

01:07:29.918 --> 01:07:32.118
Auburn, then?

01:07:36.998 --> 01:07:40.838
That's enough, Mrs. Brandt.
We mustn't tire him.

01:07:44.357 --> 01:07:47.798
- How? How?
- How is not important.

01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:51.078
What is important is that you
never speak of this to anyone.

01:07:51.237 --> 01:07:52.998
I have seriously broken the law.

01:07:53.317 --> 01:07:55.638
He must have complete rest
for a whole week.

01:07:55.797 --> 01:07:58.278
You can come visit him anytime,
if you so wish.

01:07:58.438 --> 01:08:01.038
And at the end of a week,
you can take him away...

01:08:01.197 --> 01:08:03.838
...and start a new life together.

01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:07.718
You helped, Dr. Holst?

01:08:08.677 --> 01:08:11.078
Thank you.

01:08:11.237 --> 01:08:13.238
Thank you.

01:08:34.837 --> 01:08:37.438
- What can I say to you?
- Nothing needs to be said.

01:08:37.596 --> 01:08:40.997
Remember, don't mention this to anyone.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:47.198
Goodbye, Mrs. Brandt, and please
don't worry. There's no cause.

01:08:50.118 --> 01:08:53.158
Pack. We're leaving.

01:09:19.678 --> 01:09:23.558
Straight on, then turn right
at the next crossroads.

01:10:40.798 --> 01:10:43.838
I must have been out of my mind
not to come to you at once.

01:10:43.998 --> 01:10:46.958
That was very stupid of you, Mrs. Brandt.

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:51.118
- You say that he recognized you?
- He knew his name.

01:10:51.277 --> 01:10:54.078
He knew my name.
He knew the color of my hair.

01:10:54.237 --> 01:10:56.798
Inspector, up here, quickly.

01:11:13.357 --> 01:11:15.318
No!

01:11:16.317 --> 01:11:19.438
No! No!

01:11:19.597 --> 01:11:22.318
No! No!

01:11:25.317 --> 01:11:30.118
What are we going to do, Karl?
They'll be coming for us soon, won't they?

01:11:52.397 --> 01:11:54.278
What is it, Karl?

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:17.518
Stay here.

01:12:47.038 --> 01:12:50.638
It won't be long before the police
discover where we are, old friend.

01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:55.718
So you and I must have our little talk
sooner than I anticipated.

01:13:10.597 --> 01:13:12.718
One hour.

01:13:13.758 --> 01:13:16.678
And we shall talk of things
long overdue.

01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:22.318
- What's happened, Karl?
- No questions, Anna.

01:13:22.477 --> 01:13:26.038
I want you to go to the stables,
harness the horses and stay there.

01:13:26.197 --> 01:13:29.518
But, Karl, I can't. I don't know how.

01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:32.678
He's waking Richter tonight.

01:13:32.838 --> 01:13:35.398
He'll discover what he wants
and leave without us.

01:13:35.557 --> 01:13:38.438
And without that carriage,
we can't get anywhere.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:44.118
Anna, by Richter's right hand there's a tray
with a hypodermic and a file in it.

01:13:44.277 --> 01:13:45.798
I must have them.

01:13:46.237 --> 01:13:49.158
When I say, "Why don't
you get some rest, Anna"...

01:13:49.317 --> 01:13:52.518
...I want you to get them
and bring them to me in the stable.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.078
But what do you want them for?

01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:59.238
I'll know from the amount used
what time he's waking.

01:13:59.397 --> 01:14:03.798
When Frankenstein goes downstairs,
we take the carriage.

01:14:07.237 --> 01:14:09.678
I'd like some coffee, Anna.

01:14:19.718 --> 01:14:24.038
- How much longer must we stay here?
- A few days yet.

01:14:44.038 --> 01:14:46.678
Well, I think I'll try to get some sleep.

01:14:46.838 --> 01:14:49.158
Why don't you have a rest, Anna?

01:14:52.477 --> 01:14:54.558
What time in the morning?

01:14:54.718 --> 01:14:56.998
Seven. Sharp.

01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:48.438
No.

01:17:09.798 --> 01:17:11.638
Please.

01:17:24.798 --> 01:17:27.878
I mean you no harm.

01:17:28.998 --> 01:17:31.398
Frankenstein...

01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:34.598
...where is he?

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:58.278
What are you doing, Karl?

01:19:02.158 --> 01:19:04.158
What happened?

01:19:06.277 --> 01:19:08.558
What have you done to him?

01:19:08.718 --> 01:19:11.918
What have you done to him?!

01:19:12.637 --> 01:19:15.118
He was awake.

01:19:16.277 --> 01:19:17.958
- I stabbed him.
- You...?

01:19:50.277 --> 01:19:52.158
No.

01:19:53.317 --> 01:19:55.198
No.

01:20:01.357 --> 01:20:03.438
Anna.

01:20:05.038 --> 01:20:06.958
Anna.

01:24:54.637 --> 01:24:57.998
I had to come here, Ella.

01:24:58.158 --> 01:25:00.998
I had nowhere else to go.

01:25:01.158 --> 01:25:05.238
The letter was the only way
of introducing myself to you.

01:25:06.477 --> 01:25:09.438
For God's sake, who are you?

01:25:09.597 --> 01:25:12.238
I buried my husband days ago.

01:25:12.397 --> 01:25:15.838
Who are you to contemplate
such a dreadful joke?

01:25:16.118 --> 01:25:20.038
I am your husband, Ella.

01:25:20.918 --> 01:25:23.958
You'll not recognize my voice...

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:27.598
...because it is the voice
of a different person.

01:25:28.517 --> 01:25:30.518
No.

01:25:30.678 --> 01:25:32.798
No. Who are you?

01:25:33.718 --> 01:25:37.318
You asked me,
did I recognize your voice...

01:25:38.158 --> 01:25:40.638
...and what was the color of your hair?

01:25:41.878 --> 01:25:45.078
And I answered
by raising my left hand.

01:25:47.437 --> 01:25:49.638
I have become the victim of...

01:25:49.798 --> 01:25:53.838
...everything that Frankenstein
and I ever advocated.

01:25:56.437 --> 01:25:58.598
My brain...

01:25:59.878 --> 01:26:01.718
...is in someone else's body.

01:26:03.277 --> 01:26:06.038
I cannot leave here, Ella.

01:26:06.197 --> 01:26:08.598
There's nowhere else for me to go.

01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:14.358
Frankenstein will know I could only come
here, and soon he will come for me.

01:26:15.397 --> 01:26:17.718
I know why he did this.

01:26:19.118 --> 01:26:24.758
I must have been at some point
where I was very close to death.

01:26:24.918 --> 01:26:27.558
He had to keep my brain alive.

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:31.078
He wants the formula...

01:26:31.878 --> 01:26:34.918
...that I was going to give him.

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:41.158
I cannot risk your going
to the police before he arrives.

01:26:42.437 --> 01:26:45.638
I will release you
when the time is right.

01:29:13.237 --> 01:29:16.638
I didn't want you to see me, Ella.

01:29:17.758 --> 01:29:18.998
Please.

01:29:21.277 --> 01:29:24.118
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't touch me.

01:29:37.678 --> 01:29:40.438
I wouldn't harm you, Ella.

01:29:40.838 --> 01:29:42.918
I'm your husband.

01:29:43.078 --> 01:29:45.518
Don't say that.

01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:48.318
You're not...

01:29:48.477 --> 01:29:51.798
You're not anything human.

01:30:01.197 --> 01:30:04.358
You'd kill me?

01:30:04.517 --> 01:30:07.598
Yes, I'd kill you.

01:30:07.758 --> 01:30:10.238
I've been driven almost insane.

01:30:10.397 --> 01:30:13.078
Why have you come here? Why?

01:30:17.437 --> 01:30:19.638
For revenge.

01:30:20.878 --> 01:30:23.518
Do I not deserve revenge?

01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:14.038
You may leave now.

01:31:18.118 --> 01:31:21.478
Go by the back staircase,
and move quietly.

01:31:44.038 --> 01:31:46.278
I fancy...

01:31:46.437 --> 01:31:52.198
...that I am the spider
and you are the fly, Frankenstein.

01:31:52.437 --> 01:31:55.038
I know why you did this.

01:31:55.197 --> 01:31:56.998
And what you've come for.

01:31:57.158 --> 01:32:01.038
Brandt, our work.
Our research, remember?

01:32:01.197 --> 01:32:03.918
We must continue together.

01:32:04.078 --> 01:32:06.998
Better you had killed me.

01:32:10.637 --> 01:32:13.398
That would be my wife
on her way to the police.

01:32:13.557 --> 01:32:17.798
What you want is on a desk
in my study.

01:32:18.557 --> 01:32:21.558
The game is for you to try and get it.

01:32:35.437 --> 01:32:37.238
Wrong door.

01:32:42.397 --> 01:32:44.118
You must choose...

01:32:44.277 --> 01:32:47.878
...between the flames and the police,
Frankenstein.

01:32:48.038 --> 01:32:51.478
You haven't got long
to get those papers.

01:33:09.958 --> 01:33:12.678
Only one door left, Frankenstein.

01:34:37.798 --> 01:34:40.358
No! Brandt, no!

01:34:40.517 --> 01:34:43.198
No! Brandt!

01:34:43.357 --> 01:34:46.718
No! Brandt! No!

01:34:47.437 --> 01:34:49.278
No! Brandt!

01:34:49.357 --> 01:34:52.358
No! Brandt! No!
