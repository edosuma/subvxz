WEBVTT

00:07.550 --> 00:12.513
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.055 --> 00:16.851
<i>If I had a heart,
I could love you</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:22.481
<i>If I had a voice, I would sing</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:28.738
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.697 --> 00:34.910
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.334 --> 00:45.504
<i>If I had a voice, I would sing</i>

03:41.388 --> 03:43.224
Do not grieve overmuch.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.228
She succeeded
in her life's mission,

03:47.311 --> 03:49.063
to see you become King,

03:50.356 --> 03:52.233
and then to secure your throne.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.777
She went through
many, many trials

03:54.860 --> 03:56.320
and tribulations for you.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.327
You have a duty now
to repay her love

04:03.410 --> 04:06.789
by becoming a great king.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.535
SHence!

04:50.583 --> 04:52.293
You have chosen your weapons.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.628
You are entitled
to a second shield

04:54.712 --> 04:56.255
if the first one is shattered.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.967
This is a fight to the death.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.344
You will both enter
the sacred circle,

05:02.720 --> 05:05.055
but only one of you
will come out of it alive.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.684
King Frodo, if you die,
your people will settle here.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.978
If Ubbe dies,

05:11.061 --> 05:12.980
we attack Wessex together.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.815
This is the law.

05:38.923 --> 05:40.716
Come on, come on.

07:54.016 --> 07:57.019
You were on point
of death when I found you.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.523
Now, you are reborn.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.162
Your old life is dead.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.623
You must forget it.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.336
What. what are you doing?
Don't worry.

08:39.228 --> 08:42.231
That is beginning
of your new life.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.660
Yes, come on!

10:36.887 --> 10:37.971
Ooh...

12:18.196 --> 12:20.824
- Frodo, get up!
- Get up!

13:22.094 --> 13:23.261
Odin.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.098
Allfather.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.392
Help me.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.811
Help.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.994
End it! End it!

14:05.011 --> 14:06.096
Hurry!

15:05.071 --> 15:06.531
Ubbe has won.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.201
The son of Ragnar has won.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.876
Ubbe!

15:19.336 --> 15:21.254
Ubbe! Ubbe!

15:30.430 --> 15:33.058
Make way.
Make way there.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.942
What happened to Ubbe?
Is he all right?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.195
Ubbe is badly hurt.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.603
Take him to my chamber. TORVI:
But he prevented the war.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.871
Lageflha?

15:57.415 --> 15:58.416
You're alive?

16:00.335 --> 16:01.795
Yes, I'm alive.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.966
As you can see,
it is difficult to kill me.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.807
But what of Ubbe?

16:20.188 --> 16:22.107
Where is my baby?

16:22.190 --> 16:24.526
What have you done to him?
Never mind where he is.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.445
What is your excuse
for producing such a monster?

16:27.529 --> 16:30.282
You promised me. You promised
me a beautiful ohild.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.908
He was our child.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.744
The child of a god.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.080
Your child.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.416
My child? Odin's son

16:39.499 --> 16:42.085
was the fairest and most
beautiful of all the gods.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.421
I thought...
It doesn't matter!

16:44.504 --> 16:47.132
Ivar, please tell me...

16:49.426 --> 16:51.303
What have you done
with our child?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.263
With our son.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.681
It's not my fault.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.808
You did this.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.768
Where is my baby?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.272
Where is my baby?

17:51.821 --> 17:53.073
Lash it off!

17:53.323 --> 17:54.366
Lash it!

17:59.287 --> 18:00.372
Hold on!

18:00.789 --> 18:02.707
I warned you, Ironside!

18:02.999 --> 18:04.459
I warned you!

18:07.253 --> 18:08.380
Give it that.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.882
Shall we gather in the sail?

18:10.965 --> 18:13.426
No! We will run
with the storm!

18:21.059 --> 18:22.685
What is your
name, shield-maiden?

18:22.769 --> 18:23.770
Amma

18:23.853 --> 18:25.939
Look after my little
brother, Magnus.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.274
All right.
On. God!

18:34.989 --> 18:36.658
Jesus, save me, please!

18:36.950 --> 18:38.368
Oh, God, I pray!

18:38.743 --> 18:39.994
Help me, please!

18:40.078 --> 18:42.455
Why would
the Christian God save you?

18:42.539 --> 18:44.207
Through the storm.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.333
Hold on!

18:47.001 --> 18:49.003
Magnus, pull in the sail.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.549
Pass the ropes!

21:03.513 --> 21:04.597
That's it.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.538
Do you know where we are?
I'm not sure.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.625
I have some idea.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.962
I think I recognize
those mountains.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.923
I don't know how many ships
we lost in the storm.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.968
Not enough to
change my intentions.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.430
We will cross those mountains
and attack Kattegat

21:45.513 --> 21:47.056
and rip it from Ivar's grip.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.433
And that's all very well,

21:48.516 --> 21:50.393
but this is my army, not yours,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.395
and they will do as I say.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.148
I don't understand.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.733
Have you changed your mind?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.568
Do you not want
to attack Kattegat?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.153
I may do.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.779
It depends.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.742
I may do a deal
with Ivar. Who knows?

22:09.412 --> 22:10.955
Well, if you make
a deal with Ivar,

22:11.039 --> 22:12.290
then you will have to kill me.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.128
I know.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.883
And if you don't want me
to make a deal with Ivar,

22:23.217 --> 22:25.720
then maybe you will have to
kill me, Bjorn Ironside.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.264
I know,

22:28.931 --> 22:32.060
they say that you
are protected by the gods,

22:32.935 --> 22:35.938
and therefore, indestructible.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.733
But I don't think so.

22:39.650 --> 22:40.902
I think

22:41.319 --> 22:43.363
you bleed like any other man.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.245
Like any other man!

23:16.646 --> 23:18.314
You are both so stupid.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.274
You want the same thing.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.693
You want the crown of Kattegat.

23:22.777 --> 23:26.447
But you can't have the crown
until you take it from Ivar.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.032
So why do you fight now?

23:30.368 --> 23:32.328
If you have to, fight later.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.414
Fight about Kattegat.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.624
Or whatever else
you want to fight about.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.282
Amen.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.403
Get back to the shore!

24:51.073 --> 24:53.284
Why did you call out
to the Christian God?

24:53.367 --> 24:54.494
What?

24:54.577 --> 24:57.538
During the storm. You called
out to Jesus to save you.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.707
Do you believe
in the Christian God,

24:59.790 --> 25:02.001
even though you are
Bjorn Ironside's brother?

25:02.084 --> 25:03.127
Of course, I don't.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.504
Then why did you
call out to him?

25:04.587 --> 25:06.923
I lived among
the Saxons for many years.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.925
I had to go to their churches.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.010
I had to pretend
to believe in their God,

25:11.093 --> 25:13.012
otherwise, they
would have killed me.

25:13.221 --> 25:16.098
But still. you celled out to him
when you were afraid of dying,

25:16.182 --> 25:18.017
so I think you must
believe in him.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.521
Why is it you that are asking
me all these questions?

25:21.604 --> 25:23.981
Because Bjorn asked me
to look after you.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.942
I don't need anyone
to look after me.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.110
Especially not you.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.531
Turn it over.
Here, give me a hand.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.620
Help me, brother.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.373
Did you know that your little
brother was a Christian?

25:47.171 --> 25:48.548
She's slipping anchor!

25:50.049 --> 25:51.592
Tie the ropes off!

26:01.852 --> 26:03.354
We're almost there.

26:07.775 --> 26:08.859
The King.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.559
Here is your land.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.394
Here is your new world.

26:44.312 --> 26:46.939
The world that Ragnar Lothbrok
promised you.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.275
And his son, Ubbe,
has delivered to you.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.112
This is the beginning of
something new for all of us.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.449
May your gods and mine bless
and prosper this settlement,

26:56.532 --> 26:59.660
and may it lead to perpetual
peace between all our peoples.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.496
On such land, King Alfred,
we shall surely prosper.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.291
For we are hard-working
and serious people.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.045
In the past, you've
mistaken us forsavages.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.171
Yes.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.775
Ragnar, do you see this?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.945
Are you watching this?

27:37.823 --> 27:39.325
This is our dream.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.500
Hail Ivar!

27:47.583 --> 27:49.335
- Hail Ivar!
- Hail Ivar!

28:15.569 --> 28:16.654
Carry on.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.535
Carry on!

28:34.880 --> 28:36.340
They have found our son.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.721
Well, they have
found part of him.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.514
Hunters.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.308
They were killing foxes, and
in their den, theyfound”.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.651
Just think...

28:57.445 --> 28:59.071
The son of a god,

28:59.989 --> 29:03.242
dragged beneath the earth,
eaten by foxes.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.996
I wonder if he was still alive?

29:09.582 --> 29:10.791
No.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.543
No, of course not.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.421
It was too cold.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.636
How did they know it was him?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.474
You're right, it could
have been any child.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.519
And perhaps I was wrong
to talk about our child

29:30.895 --> 29:32.480
as if he was a god.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.733
He was after all,
just another child.

29:38.903 --> 29:40.696
Tell me the truth, Ivar.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.908
Did you kill our son?

29:45.075 --> 29:47.495
After everything I did for you.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.623
After everything that
you did for me?

29:51.457 --> 29:54.418
What did you do
for me, Freydis, huh?

29:58.005 --> 29:59.590
Was he really my son?

30:00.007 --> 30:02.968
Was he? You see,
I'm not so sure anymore!

30:03.636 --> 30:07.181
I'm not sure that that poor
crippled bastard was my son.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.849
Yes.
Was he?

30:08.933 --> 30:10.601
Yes.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.770
You lied to me.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.648
No.
You lied to me.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.485
Everything you ever
said was a lie.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.321
Everything.

30:24.532 --> 30:25.616
No.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.624
Well, here we are.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.545
Yes.
I still can't help wondering

31:20.129 --> 31:22.047
if I have made the right choice.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.968
Everything I hear about Ivar

31:26.051 --> 31:28.512
makes me believe
that he is a man

31:28.971 --> 31:31.015
unlike all others.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.934
A force of nature.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.562
If you believe in fate,

31:36.645 --> 31:40.065
then it seems that his star
is in the ascendancy.

31:41.483 --> 31:45.070
I think your reading of fate
is far too easy.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.616
YOU see some success,

31:48.699 --> 31:51.577
you see someone who appears
to be very powerful,

31:52.161 --> 31:54.622
and so you think
fate is on his side.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.291
I have spent a lifetime

31:57.374 --> 31:59.960
trying to figure out
what fate had in store for me.

32:01.003 --> 32:04.798
And all I know is that the
gods work in mysterious ways.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.885
Ways that you and I can't even
begin to understand.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.137
Oh, you're very
clever, Hvitserk.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.181
I'll give you that.

32:12.973 --> 32:17.436
But I still don't know
if I made the right choice.

32:17.895 --> 32:23.025
We could be marching
willingly right now

32:24.777 --> 32:26.362
towards our own death.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.265
I love you.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.059
It feels good to be alive.

33:41.311 --> 33:44.064
I have to tell you that you have
realized your father's dream.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.317
Three thousand Danes
have gone to the settlement.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.154
Three thousand.

33:50.487 --> 33:53.407
Now it can be self-sufficient.
Now it can survive.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.118
Hmm.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.327
I'm glad.

33:58.037 --> 33:59.455
Are you really glad?

34:00.956 --> 34:02.082
Yes.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.418
Yes. A thousand times, yes.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.341
Leave us.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.353
Then what is it?

34:23.437 --> 34:25.564
What is wrong? I can see
that something is wrong.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.442
Bring me the cross.

34:48.128 --> 34:50.005
Something has changed inside me.

34:50.547 --> 34:51.840
What do you mean?

34:53.008 --> 34:55.677
I don't know if it happened
during the fight,

34:55.761 --> 34:58.055
or afterwards, when I thought
I was going to die,

35:01.099 --> 35:02.810
but this cross
means nothing to me.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.939
I put it on like a breach,
a bangle, some decoration.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.818
It speaks so other
people can hear it.

35:12.361 --> 35:13.821
It doesn't speak to me.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.658
But you wanted
to be a Christian.

35:18.367 --> 35:21.411
No. I wanted what being
a Christian could do for me

35:22.412 --> 35:23.872
and my people.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.130
So you still believe
in the old ways?

35:33.382 --> 35:34.591
Yes.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.512
Yes, when I was fighting,
their spirits, they filled me.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.558
How could I fight
for a Christ God?

35:43.350 --> 35:44.601
Some stranger.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.020
No.

35:47.187 --> 35:50.023
I was filled
with the spirit of Odin,

35:50.691 --> 35:52.901
Thor, and Freyr.

35:56.113 --> 35:57.781
They were familiar spirits.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.911
In my heart, I called for
them, and they answered me.

36:06.373 --> 36:09.626
SO once more, once more,

36:12.254 --> 36:14.006
I embrace the true gods.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.341
The gods of my father.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.887
The gods of my people.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.594
Fare you well, Ubbe.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.221
My kingdom owes you
a great debt, as do I.

37:03.305 --> 37:04.932
I hope someday we can meet again

37:05.015 --> 37:06.934
when peace comes
at last to my country.

37:09.937 --> 37:13.065
You have proven yourself to be
a good and wise king, Alfred.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.359
There's no one better
to lead your country forward.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.695
And fare you well also,
Torvi, and your children.

37:18.779 --> 37:20.822
We have so much
to thank you for.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.409
May the Lord bless and keep
you, all the days of your life.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.328
Wait!

37:28.121 --> 37:29.623
If it's all right
with you, Ubbe,

37:29.706 --> 37:31.416
I want to come with you.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.752
It's time for me to go home.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.482
My people,

37:56.566 --> 37:58.068
spring is coming.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.696
The Earth renews itself.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.949
That which was dead
comes alive again.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.492
Everything changes.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.121
My wife gave birth to a child.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.457
A beautiful, beautiful boy.

38:12.541 --> 38:13.792
I held him in my arms,

38:13.875 --> 38:16.545
and he was as beautiful
and as shining

38:17.129 --> 38:18.797
as Odin's son, Baldur.

38:19.923 --> 38:23.593
My heart overflowed
with love for that child.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.017
But the gods

38:30.517 --> 38:32.310
cut his life short.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.021
I have no idea why.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.773
They have their reasons.

38:37.482 --> 38:41.319
But it is hard for a mother
to accept such things.

38:43.113 --> 38:46.241
To lose the child they have
carried inside their body.

38:49.870 --> 38:52.789
But the will of the gods
cannot be denied.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.000
They have other plans.

38:55.083 --> 38:59.504
And, in all humility, we have
to accept their verdict.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.926
King Harald and my brother,
Bjorn, have abandoned York,

39:05.635 --> 39:07.971
and the Saxons have
retaken the city.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.517
Our plan for this season
was to raise an army,

39:13.351 --> 39:15.854
sail to York, and reclaim it

39:15.937 --> 39:18.899
as part of our empire
of Kattegat.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.402
I was expecting
my brother, Hvitserk,

39:24.362 --> 39:27.240
to return with
King Olaf and his army.

39:27.324 --> 39:29.951
We were going to
attack York together.

39:33.622 --> 39:34.915
Unfortunately,

39:37.084 --> 39:38.502
they are not here.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.381
I know. I know.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.968
Things have changed.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.085
Hello, Hvitserk.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.003
Bjorn.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.550
Where are you going
with such a large army?

40:28.718 --> 40:30.470
To support Ivar, I suppose?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.601
On the contrary, to attack him.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.312
To attack Kattegat
with King Olaf.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.232
And with you, I suppose.

40:51.825 --> 40:53.742
My brother!

40:53.743 --> 40:56.121
This is one of the
happiest days of my life.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.958
How strange for our paths
to cross like this?

41:00.041 --> 41:01.793
Why strange? Was it not fated?

41:02.586 --> 41:03.920
Hmm.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.589
Are we fated to kill Ivar?

41:06.548 --> 41:08.508
Despite his crimes,
he is still our brother.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.511
It is not shameful
in the eyes of the gods?

41:12.095 --> 41:15.473
I have asked the gods so
many times why Ijumped ship.

41:16.433 --> 41:18.810
Why I abandoned Ubbe
to stay close to Ivar.

41:19.269 --> 41:23.857
Why I allowed Ivar to
humiliate me, to laugh at me.

41:26.276 --> 41:29.487
All these years I've questioned the gods.
And myself.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.157
But now I know the reason.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.492
I know my fate.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.371
My fate is to kill Ivar.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.593
My people,
we will not venture out.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.845
We will not attack York.

41:54.721 --> 41:58.475
Instead, recognizing our own
vulnerability to attack,

41:58.558 --> 42:02.687
we will renew and strengthen the
defenses of our great town.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.481
Yeah!

42:04.564 --> 42:05.982
I am with you!

42:06.066 --> 42:07.984
I am speaking for you!

42:08.068 --> 42:09.694
Yeah!

42:09.778 --> 42:12.697
Let those who want
to destroy us know this.

42:13.990 --> 42:16.868
You will never
overcome Kattegat!

42:17.619 --> 42:20.288
We will always defeat you!

42:21.081 --> 42:22.999
The gods are with us!

42:23.083 --> 42:24.125
Yeah!

42:24.209 --> 42:25.752
The gods love us!

42:25.835 --> 42:27.837
Yeah!
We are the people!

42:29.422 --> 42:30.966
Hail Ivar!

42:31.675 --> 42:33.385
Ivar! Odin!

42:33.468 --> 42:37.055
Ivar! Odin! Ivar! Odin!
