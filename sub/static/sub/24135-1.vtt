02:25.311 --> 02:26.312
Hello?

02:52.871 --> 02:53.939
Not a word.

03:25.805 --> 03:26.873
Come on.

03:30.776 --> 03:33.079
You're no good to me
if you can't get hard.

03:33.712 --> 03:34.646
Just

03:35.213 --> 03:36.682
slow down a bit, okay?

03:44.522 --> 03:45.724
Yeah.

03:59.403 --> 04:00.406
Put it in!

04:01.407 --> 04:02.342
Come on!

04:12.884 --> 04:14.052
Fuck!

04:17.055 --> 04:18.055
Fuck!

04:19.024 --> 04:20.356
Oh God!

04:20.358 --> 04:21.226
Ow...

04:22.093 --> 04:22.995
easy!

04:28.399 --> 04:29.301
Jesus!

04:33.538 --> 04:34.673
What the fuck?

04:37.009 --> 04:40.010
Fuck hell! Jesus fucking...

04:40.947 --> 04:42.480
- Ow! Fuck!
- Fuck!

04:43.682 --> 04:45.716
What the hell's
wrong with you, you crazy bitch!

04:45.718 --> 04:46.752
What the fuck?

04:47.119 --> 04:48.087
Jesus!

04:48.586 --> 04:49.654
You're soft again.

04:50.088 --> 04:51.855
Where's my fucking jacket?

04:54.826 --> 04:56.129
Fuck!

04:58.262 --> 04:59.564
Fucking faggot!

05:01.132 --> 05:02.367
What did you say?

05:05.103 --> 05:06.505
Better watch your fucking mouth!

06:53.211 --> 06:56.212
So, it's mainly our
two bedrooms and two bathrooms.

06:56.214 --> 06:58.582
Uh, this one,
which is a disaster.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.853
The other one is an
en suite in my room.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.986
Um, this is the spare room.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.755
Not much to clean in here.

07:05.757 --> 07:09.728
And this.
And this is my daughter's.

07:14.065 --> 07:15.967
Pianos, have you
ever cleaned them?

07:16.334 --> 07:17.969
- Yes.
- Eva.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.072
Could you stop for a second,
please? I'll go get it.

07:27.579 --> 07:28.548
Hello.

07:29.447 --> 07:30.415
Hi!

07:32.184 --> 07:33.252
You play really well.

07:34.386 --> 07:35.955
Beautifully, actually.

07:36.922 --> 07:37.857
Thank you.

07:40.591 --> 07:41.493
I'm Laura.

07:42.093 --> 07:42.961
Eva.

07:45.129 --> 07:46.296
Here it is.

08:22.434 --> 08:23.503
Uh, I'm all done.

08:24.269 --> 08:25.137
Okay!

08:26.338 --> 08:28.573
Is your room all right?
Everything how you like it?

08:28.874 --> 08:31.608
Yeah! Yeah, it's,
uh, nice and clean.

08:31.610 --> 08:32.745
- Thanks.
- No problem!

08:35.014 --> 08:37.349
Bye. I'll see you soon.

08:37.783 --> 08:38.717
Okay, bye.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.229
I really like your poster,
by the way.

08:51.296 --> 08:52.665
Oh! Thanks!

08:53.798 --> 08:54.964
It's funny, I wouldn't have

08:54.966 --> 08:56.033
thought that you were
a Nirvana fan,

08:56.400 --> 08:57.836
with all the classical music
you were playing before.

08:59.370 --> 09:02.674
The classical playing is just
a thing I have to do right now.

09:03.241 --> 09:04.242
Oh, okay.

09:06.311 --> 09:08.346
God, could you imagine
seeing them live?

09:10.014 --> 09:11.281
It would be really intense!

09:11.283 --> 09:12.350
It'd be crazy.

09:17.322 --> 09:18.990
I have goosebumps
just thinking about it.

09:26.999 --> 09:27.899
Bye!

09:46.118 --> 09:47.653
Anyone else
would be fired for this.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.292
I should fire you.

09:54.759 --> 09:56.596
Or take you
out of cleaning altogether...

09:58.429 --> 09:59.530
keep you in accounting.

10:00.365 --> 10:01.933
You don't seem
to bother anyone in there.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.738
Well, you don't need me
full-time in accounting.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.086
I'm sorry.

10:23.288 --> 10:24.657
You're always sorry.

10:26.424 --> 10:27.325
I mean...

10:28.293 --> 10:29.758
I just wanna know
what you were thinking.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.163
How did you honestly think
this one was gonna end?

10:33.664 --> 10:34.599
Happily?

10:35.833 --> 10:37.233
Did you think about me
for a second,

10:37.235 --> 10:38.971
about how this could
affect me and my business?

10:40.739 --> 10:42.508
- No, I guess not.
- No, I guess not!

10:50.582 --> 10:51.949
You know what?
I've asked you before

10:51.951 --> 10:53.882
to leave my employees
out of whatever it is

10:53.884 --> 10:54.919
you do out there.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.889
Well, she'll be happy to know
that I find her repulsive now.

10:59.490 --> 11:02.495
Honey, I wish you found
more people repulsive.

11:05.998 --> 11:06.966
Like you?

11:19.311 --> 11:21.445
Tell me, are you gonna
take a few days off?

11:21.447 --> 11:23.847
Because I have to make sure
I do the schedule this week.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.416
I don't know.
Maybe just in the morning...

12:21.072 --> 12:22.738
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.407
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

12:24.409 --> 12:25.944
You better jump
in there before it's all gone.

12:27.011 --> 12:28.076
Uh,

12:28.078 --> 12:29.246
that looks burnt.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.549
It is! That's the best part!

12:31.048 --> 12:33.416
Just the middle one.
This side isn't burnt.

12:33.418 --> 12:34.854
Don't forget you promised us...

12:39.124 --> 12:40.658
- Good time!
- Yeah, huh?

12:41.025 --> 12:42.927
- I'll give you a ride next time.
- Yeah!

12:43.727 --> 12:44.929
We had a great night.

12:45.163 --> 12:46.365
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you!

12:46.631 --> 12:47.863
- Thanks for the invite.
- Of course!

12:47.865 --> 12:49.000
- Take care!
- Be safe.

12:49.299 --> 12:50.099
- See you at the office.
- Bye, Laura!

12:50.101 --> 12:51.102
Bye, guys.

12:57.708 --> 12:58.777
You okay to drive?

12:59.510 --> 13:00.444
Yeah.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.846
- You sure?
- Yes.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.084
Why don't I give you
a ride home?

13:06.183 --> 13:07.350
I'll be all right.

13:07.352 --> 13:08.417
No, I'll drive you back
in the morning,

13:08.419 --> 13:09.587
and you could pick up your car.

13:09.955 --> 13:10.855
I'm fine.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.658
Why, are you, uh...

13:14.592 --> 13:16.461
you meeting somebody now?

13:18.429 --> 13:20.064
- I'm going home.
- Ah!

13:23.402 --> 13:26.605
Dad, can I have a couple
of smokes for the road?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.174
Oh, sure!

13:33.745 --> 13:35.847
Oh, I can give you four.

13:36.815 --> 13:37.649
Thanks.

13:38.115 --> 13:38.984
Okay, well,

13:39.684 --> 13:41.886
do your stops.
A lot of cops around here.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.253
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

13:44.255 --> 13:45.421
Okay.

13:45.423 --> 13:46.759
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:04.134 --> 15:05.303
Everyone clapped.

15:08.039 --> 15:09.674
We both know
you've played better.

15:14.044 --> 15:15.046
Let's go.

16:25.517 --> 16:26.485
Hey, you!

16:26.951 --> 16:27.820
Hi!

16:29.988 --> 16:31.056
Happy to see you.

16:31.756 --> 16:32.623
Me too.

16:36.327 --> 16:38.197
No, no! Leave 'em on.
I'm almost done.

16:59.484 --> 17:03.088
- It's chilly today, right?
- Yeah, it's getting cold.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.031
Don't worry. It's not
as strong as last time.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.336
I have to practice later.

17:41.926 --> 17:43.028
Lean back.

17:53.571 --> 17:55.039
Thanks!

18:05.317 --> 18:07.085
Wow, this is nice!

18:07.417 --> 18:08.419
I know...

18:08.920 --> 18:10.221
- did a great job.
- Mm-hmm!

18:12.423 --> 18:13.959
When are they gonna paint
Eva's room?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.759
Mm, this weekend, probably.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.829
I chose a great color for you.

18:18.896 --> 18:20.999
- This is so exciting!
- Yeah, I know.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.101
It's finally happening!

18:24.769 --> 18:26.471
What are we gonna do
with the spare room?

19:54.759 --> 19:57.296
I don't wanna move
into that shithole with him.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.098
What did you just say?

20:03.868 --> 20:04.836
You heard me.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.373
Teenage angst doesn't suit you.

20:11.809 --> 20:13.977
Do you actually think
that he loves you?

20:13.979 --> 20:14.880
That's enough!

20:16.114 --> 20:19.183
- He doesn't. He's just like...
- He has a name!

20:19.683 --> 20:20.685
Use it!

20:23.989 --> 20:26.689
David is just like all
the other ones,

20:26.691 --> 20:28.727
and when he dumps you,
you're gonna

20:29.126 --> 20:30.928
regret doing any of this!

20:32.028 --> 20:32.931
You listen to me.

20:33.765 --> 20:34.732
When you're 18,

20:35.199 --> 20:37.436
I will be the last one
stopping you from moving out.

20:39.103 --> 20:42.403
In the meantime, you're 16,
stuck with me and David,

20:42.405 --> 20:43.405
so deal with it!

20:43.407 --> 20:45.443
You're a selfish bitch!

20:48.246 --> 20:50.747
I have a right to be happy,
goddammit!

20:50.749 --> 20:51.750
So do I!

21:26.317 --> 21:27.318
Eva?

21:33.391 --> 21:34.593
Oh my God!

21:35.326 --> 21:36.795
You okay? What happened?

21:37.729 --> 21:38.630
Nothing.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.165
Did you and your mom
get in a fight?

21:42.266 --> 21:43.735
I hate her!

21:44.603 --> 21:45.603
What happened?

21:48.372 --> 21:49.441
I'm moving.

21:50.340 --> 21:51.375
The house sold.

21:55.246 --> 21:56.381
It's really happening.

22:00.050 --> 22:02.253
- It's so unfair!
- Shh! Come here!

22:03.288 --> 22:04.323
I know.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.001
Don't cry, sweetie.

22:18.803 --> 22:20.205
I don't wanna move there.

22:21.806 --> 22:22.673
I know.

22:36.654 --> 22:38.522
You don't have to do anything
you don't wanna do.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.796
You have don't to let your mothr
make your decisions for you

22:45.563 --> 22:46.832
or control your life.

22:54.838 --> 22:56.540
Well, I can... I can't just...

22:57.541 --> 22:59.110
tell her I'm not going.

23:03.346 --> 23:04.816
You don't
have to tell her anything.

23:56.733 --> 23:57.802
Hey!

24:10.381 --> 24:11.283
You made it!

24:26.297 --> 24:28.499
You have a lot of clothes.

24:29.299 --> 24:31.668
Well, what's mine is yours!

24:32.169 --> 24:33.104
Here, try that on.

24:34.939 --> 24:35.806
Um...

24:36.941 --> 24:39.709
yeah, I think these pants
are too small on me, but, um,

24:39.711 --> 24:41.846
- they might work for you.
- Thanks!

24:42.680 --> 24:44.145
Just take off those rags,
settle in!

24:45.817 --> 24:48.683
- Um, I'll make us a drink.
- Okay.

25:11.608 --> 25:14.178
What's funny?

25:16.614 --> 25:18.249
Uh, nothing. I just.

25:20.351 --> 25:21.886
I find you fit in so well here,

25:22.487 --> 25:23.921
just...

25:24.488 --> 25:27.125
sitting there
like that in my house.

25:27.659 --> 25:28.593
Oh!

25:28.992 --> 25:29.827
Really?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.163
Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
You just seem really, um,

25:33.864 --> 25:34.833
familiar to me.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.802
Hmm! Cool!

25:46.410 --> 25:48.846
I like your place.
It's really cool.

25:49.980 --> 25:50.848
Thanks!

25:52.384 --> 25:54.152
I tried to make it nice inside,
but

25:54.685 --> 25:56.754
I kind of hate this
neighborhood, it's so boring.

26:01.392 --> 26:03.761
So? Do you feel
amazing right now?

26:04.595 --> 26:05.430
Um,

26:06.230 --> 26:08.365
yeah. I... I feel different,

26:08.999 --> 26:10.000
I think, somehow.

26:10.634 --> 26:11.736
But, like, in a good way, right?

26:12.036 --> 26:14.038
Yeah! Yeah.

26:17.441 --> 26:19.210
You know, you really did
the right thing coming here.

26:21.077 --> 26:21.946
Yeah.

26:24.414 --> 26:25.683
Just happy I could help you out.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.089
Cheers!

28:18.261 --> 28:19.828
That was amazing!

28:19.830 --> 28:22.998
Oh my God!
You were going so fast!

28:23.000 --> 28:26.837
- I know! I think I won, though.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure you did.

28:28.439 --> 28:30.807
It's so funny. I never would've
thought I liked go-karting.

28:31.307 --> 28:33.177
Thank you so much
for bringing me.

28:33.777 --> 28:34.645
It's no problem.

28:35.546 --> 28:36.581
After you.

28:50.327 --> 28:51.559
Sweetie, you're all knots.

28:56.733 --> 28:58.234
That's where you hold
all your stress.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.739
Right there.
You feel how hard it is?

29:01.739 --> 29:02.606
Yeah.

29:03.673 --> 29:05.210
Just relax now.

29:13.617 --> 29:14.850
I don't think
sleeping on the sofa

29:14.852 --> 29:16.019
is gonna help these knots.

29:18.021 --> 29:19.522
You should share my bed
with me tonight.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.092
You'll be more comfortable.

29:22.759 --> 29:24.729
- You sure?
- Yeah, totally.

29:26.529 --> 29:28.031
I want you to get good rest.

29:28.565 --> 29:29.433
You deserve it.

29:30.867 --> 29:31.734
Okay.

29:32.502 --> 29:34.239
Just, um, come
in when you're done.

29:55.558 --> 29:56.927
I'm really glad you're here.

29:58.796 --> 29:59.663
Me too.

30:04.868 --> 30:05.769
Goodnight.

30:53.483 --> 30:55.984
Okay, well,
it used to be, um, Diane.

30:55.986 --> 30:58.857
And then, recently,
it got handed over to Laura.

31:03.059 --> 31:04.162
- Hi!
- Morning!

31:05.028 --> 31:06.297
Morning!

31:08.365 --> 31:09.532
Get any sleep?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.865
- Not much.
- Yeah.

31:10.867 --> 31:11.702
Hey, Margaret!

31:12.135 --> 31:13.567
- Hi, Will!
- Hey, uh,

31:13.569 --> 31:15.072
do you have a second
to come to my office?

31:15.873 --> 31:17.075
- Yeah.
- Great.

31:19.276 --> 31:20.209
How are you?

31:20.211 --> 31:21.211
- Fine.
- Good.

31:24.048 --> 31:27.618
Um, there's a detective who
wants to ask you some questions.

31:29.354 --> 31:30.721
- What about?
- I have no idea. Do you?

31:31.388 --> 31:32.256
No.

31:33.222 --> 31:34.290
Uh, this is Laura.

31:35.057 --> 31:36.324
- Hi, Laura.
- Hi!

31:36.326 --> 31:37.792
Detective Dozier.
Pleased to meet you.

31:37.794 --> 31:38.663
Nice to meet you.

31:39.163 --> 31:40.895
Could you give us
a minute, please?

31:40.897 --> 31:42.331
Oh, I thought I was
supposed to be here.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.265
No, we're gonna be okay.

31:43.267 --> 31:44.369
- Oh, okay!
- Thanks.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.306
So Laura,
I understand you're the cleaner

31:51.308 --> 31:54.477
- at the Lansdowne residence?
- Yeah, that's right.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.344
We're investigating
the disappearance

31:56.346 --> 31:57.749
of their daughter, Eva.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.118
When was
the last time you saw her?

32:02.252 --> 32:03.721
Oh my God! Um...

32:05.422 --> 32:08.092
four or five days ago.
Last time I cleaned.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.859
Did you guys ever have
any conversations

32:10.861 --> 32:13.027
about her personal life?
Did she ever mention

32:13.029 --> 32:16.399
that she was in any
trouble, she was unhappy?

32:16.967 --> 32:20.471
No, uh, she really kept
to herself. We barely spoke.

32:21.404 --> 32:22.307
You sure?

32:22.873 --> 32:23.740
Yeah.

32:26.443 --> 32:29.143
If anything else comes up,
feel free to give me a call.

32:29.145 --> 32:30.181
Sure.

32:30.647 --> 32:32.015
Any information could help us
in the investigation.

32:32.383 --> 32:34.149
- Of course.
- All right, thank you very much.

32:34.151 --> 32:35.586
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

32:38.020 --> 32:39.121
All good?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.624
- It's fine.
- Yeah, good.

32:40.923 --> 32:42.090
Excuse me, Mr. Drake?

32:42.092 --> 32:43.292
- Uh-huh?
- Could I get a minute

32:43.294 --> 32:44.495
- with you now?
- Of course.

33:09.787 --> 33:10.654
Sorry.

33:42.152 --> 33:43.020
Hey, Eva!

33:43.686 --> 33:44.554
Hi!

33:45.521 --> 33:47.090
Uh, can you come in here
for a sec?

33:52.896 --> 33:53.764
Hey!

33:57.366 --> 33:58.536
How was your day?

34:00.269 --> 34:01.471
It was okay. You?

34:02.707 --> 34:04.108
It was pretty good!

34:04.641 --> 34:05.509
Yeah?

34:06.844 --> 34:08.244
What did you do? Did you, uh,

34:08.679 --> 34:10.280
go out at all,
for a walk or anything?

34:10.981 --> 34:14.185
No. No, I just... I stayed
in here and read my book.

34:15.318 --> 34:17.422
You didn't talk to anybody?
My neighbors in the back or...

34:18.521 --> 34:20.090
No! No, nobody.

34:21.826 --> 34:22.693
What's wrong?

34:25.661 --> 34:26.529
Um...

34:27.030 --> 34:28.632
a police officer
came to see me today,

34:28.898 --> 34:31.368
looking for you. But it's okay.
I took care of it.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.539
What did he say to you?
What did he want?

34:35.873 --> 34:37.842
Don't worry.
I didn't say anything.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.679
Yeah, but why...
Why did he go see you?

34:42.646 --> 34:45.283
I guess because I clean
your mom's house. I don't know.

34:45.916 --> 34:46.784
But it's fine!

34:47.550 --> 34:49.453
So the police are looking
for me. That's serious!

34:50.585 --> 34:51.588
It doesn't have to be.

34:53.590 --> 34:54.458
Do you think

34:54.724 --> 34:56.293
I should call my mom or...

35:00.429 --> 35:01.632
And tell her what?

35:03.568 --> 35:08.606
I... I don't know, that I'm okay
and not to worry about me.

35:09.405 --> 35:10.273
And?

35:12.041 --> 35:12.942
And what?

35:13.744 --> 35:15.443
I don't know. I think she's
gonna be pretty fucking curious

35:15.445 --> 35:16.948
about where you are
and where the hell you've been!

35:18.248 --> 35:19.416
Yeah, but I'll just...

35:19.750 --> 35:21.617
I won't tell her,
and I'll go home

35:21.619 --> 35:23.918
and that'll be it,
and the police will stop

35:23.920 --> 35:25.753
- looking for me.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

35:25.755 --> 35:26.958
I shouldn't have said anything.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.094
I just lied to the police
for you!

35:31.528 --> 35:33.329
I'm on record saying that
I don't know anything about you,

35:33.331 --> 35:34.798
and I have no idea
where you are.

35:36.099 --> 35:37.835
And you're 16.
Do you know what that means?

35:38.936 --> 35:39.803
No.

35:40.436 --> 35:41.970
It means
I'll be in serious fucking shit

35:41.972 --> 35:43.608
if anybody finds out
that you're here with me!

35:44.141 --> 35:46.208
But I just won't tell them.
I'll make something up!

35:46.210 --> 35:48.577
Eva you can't just make shit up
to the police, all right!

35:48.579 --> 35:50.347
- They'd never believe you!
- How do you know?

35:51.447 --> 35:53.617
Who listens to anything
that you have to say?

35:55.518 --> 35:58.021
Your mother? Her boyfriend?
Fucking anyone?

35:59.990 --> 36:02.659
No, nobody listens to what
you have to say, except me.

36:06.362 --> 36:07.498
And that's the truth.

36:14.003 --> 36:14.971
I lied for you.

36:15.972 --> 36:16.840
To protect

36:17.307 --> 36:18.141
you.

36:21.945 --> 36:22.913
So, no, I'm sorry.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.649
You're not fucking
calling anyone!

36:40.797 --> 36:41.666
Here you go.

36:48.172 --> 36:49.072
You like this song?

36:50.340 --> 36:51.209
Yeah.

36:52.643 --> 36:53.510
I love it.

37:10.559 --> 37:12.128
I think there's still some left
in here.

37:12.563 --> 37:13.431
You want some?

37:14.231 --> 37:15.099
Uh,

37:15.532 --> 37:16.400
sure.

37:35.786 --> 37:36.653
Here, I'm done.

37:37.119 --> 37:37.989
You can take another.

37:38.755 --> 37:39.757
Just finish it off.

37:50.266 --> 37:51.134
Here.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.480
There you go.

38:05.215 --> 38:06.417
That's it. That's it.

38:08.117 --> 38:08.985
Yeah.

38:16.592 --> 38:18.561
I should call my mom.

38:27.371 --> 38:28.372
Dad?

38:29.840 --> 38:30.707
Yeah, um,

38:31.275 --> 38:32.773
I don't think I can come in
to work today.

38:32.775 --> 38:33.677
I feel really sick.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.517
Yeah, I know,
but Susan can do it.

38:44.387 --> 38:45.855
Today? I thought
that was tomorrow.

38:49.059 --> 38:50.161
Well...

38:51.728 --> 38:52.596
Yeah, I know.

38:54.063 --> 38:54.931
I know.

38:57.601 --> 38:58.469
All right.

38:59.835 --> 39:01.004
All right, fine.

39:01.704 --> 39:02.739
Yeah, I'm coming.

39:33.637 --> 39:34.672
Okay...

39:36.873 --> 39:37.875
keep going down.

39:39.242 --> 39:40.110
No, no. here.

39:40.710 --> 39:41.679
Scroll down.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.347
Okay, thanks.

39:46.882 --> 39:49.085
I can't believe these bastards
are auditing us again.

39:56.693 --> 39:58.661
Are you feeling any better
than this morning?

40:00.630 --> 40:02.065
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

40:16.679 --> 40:18.782
Okay. Send me that file
when you're done, okay?

40:20.016 --> 40:21.018
Okay.

40:26.356 --> 40:27.391
What was that?

41:43.666 --> 41:44.668
Laura?

41:50.407 --> 41:51.242
Laura?

41:52.076 --> 41:53.711
Laura!

41:58.081 --> 42:00.150
Laura!

42:06.021 --> 42:08.025
Come on! Laura!

42:23.940 --> 42:24.842
Laura?

43:50.726 --> 43:51.594
Eva?

43:52.961 --> 43:54.095
<i>Laura?</i>

43:54.097 --> 43:55.465
Yeah, Eva. Eva, it's me.

43:55.764 --> 43:58.266
<i>What am I doing in here?
Let me... Let me out!</i>

43:58.268 --> 44:00.070
I'm gonna let you out right now,
okay?

44:00.436 --> 44:02.304
- Just calm down.
- <i>Please!</i>

44:03.039 --> 44:04.271
There's nothing to worry about.

44:04.273 --> 44:05.342
I'm gonna explain everything,
okay?

44:07.110 --> 44:07.978
<i>Okay.</i>

44:09.411 --> 44:11.180
Just back away from the door,
okay?

44:12.581 --> 44:13.449
<i>Okay.</i>

44:22.324 --> 44:23.192
Hey, you.

44:23.527 --> 44:24.994
Why... Why did you put me
in here?

44:26.829 --> 44:28.563
Because you were really
out of it, and I just wanted

44:28.565 --> 44:30.097
to make sure
we had a chance to talk.

44:30.099 --> 44:31.733
So you locked me in a room?

44:31.735 --> 44:33.836
Just so I could get back
and we could talk.

44:34.103 --> 44:35.305
Talk about what? Let me out!

44:35.505 --> 44:37.304
Okay, wait. You really need
to calm down okay.

44:37.306 --> 44:38.442
- Everything's fine!
- I...

44:40.577 --> 44:41.445
How do you feel?

44:43.112 --> 44:45.048
Do you feel like you understand
what we're a part of now?

44:45.882 --> 44:47.481
I... I don't wanna be in here!

44:47.483 --> 44:50.284
Okay, but I really need to hear
from you that you understand.

44:50.286 --> 44:52.119
I understand that I need
to leave, okay?

44:52.121 --> 44:54.057
So, please, Laura!
Laura, please!

44:55.826 --> 44:56.693
What are you doing?

44:59.195 --> 45:00.364
You still need to be in here.

45:02.664 --> 45:03.701
What are you talking about?

45:05.635 --> 45:07.200
I understand
that you're confused.

45:07.202 --> 45:08.304
I'm not confused about

45:08.505 --> 45:09.670
- anything!
- I know it's a lot to process,

45:09.672 --> 45:11.007
- but it's okay.
- I wanna get out!

45:12.742 --> 45:14.878
Eva, I told you

45:15.144 --> 45:17.510
that I would be in serious
fucking trouble with the police

45:17.512 --> 45:19.549
if they found out you were here,
and you didn't care!

45:21.483 --> 45:24.621
I'll go to jail if they find out
what I did to help you!

45:26.056 --> 45:27.257
Jail, Eva!

45:29.858 --> 45:31.694
So, you get it now,
or is that what you want?

45:32.661 --> 45:33.663
Is that what you want?

45:34.496 --> 45:36.567
Answer me!
Is that what you fucking want?

45:36.967 --> 45:37.835
No!

45:38.735 --> 45:39.603
No!

45:44.873 --> 45:46.476
You made a choice.

45:48.110 --> 45:50.313
You made a choice to come here.

45:51.114 --> 45:52.479
And I cannot be the only one

45:52.481 --> 45:54.751
that has to suffer
the fucking consequences!

45:59.188 --> 46:00.957
Laura! Laura!

46:04.427 --> 46:05.295
Laura!

46:08.364 --> 46:09.432
Laura!

46:10.766 --> 46:12.135
I'm sorry.

47:07.324 --> 47:08.758
- Hello.
- Oh!

47:09.092 --> 47:12.695
Um, no, I don't need the house
to be cleaned right now.

47:13.630 --> 47:14.498
Okay.

47:15.965 --> 47:17.334
Should I come back another time?

47:18.869 --> 47:20.871
I don't know. Not for a while.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.673
Tell your boss that, okay?
Not for a while.

47:24.606 --> 47:25.474
Sure.

47:26.108 --> 47:26.976
I, uh...

47:28.711 --> 47:30.146
I heard about what happened...

47:31.380 --> 47:32.548
and I'm really sorry.

47:35.652 --> 47:36.519
Thank you.

47:59.574 --> 48:01.878
I... I was wondering
if I could give you some, um...

48:02.911 --> 48:04.747
missing posters of my daughter?

48:06.115 --> 48:08.751
Our time's up with the police
and, uh, their help.

48:09.952 --> 48:12.219
So I thought maybe
you could hand them out

48:12.221 --> 48:13.389
to the people you work with?

48:15.291 --> 48:16.193
Yeah, of course.

48:19.228 --> 48:21.431
She's... She's just
a runaway to them.

48:23.932 --> 48:25.499
They're not looking
for her anymore?

48:25.501 --> 48:26.369
No.

48:29.773 --> 48:31.041
That's... That's terrible.

48:33.742 --> 48:34.710
Thank you.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.501
Hey.

49:34.971 --> 49:36.373
Hey. Hey, you.

49:50.619 --> 49:53.322
No more of this tension
between us.

49:55.090 --> 49:56.025
Okay?

49:57.159 --> 49:58.195
It's poison.

50:00.463 --> 50:01.631
Let's just start over.

50:10.273 --> 50:11.173
I can be...

50:13.175 --> 50:15.177
a total wreck sometimes.

50:18.114 --> 50:19.682
And I know
that I fucked up.

50:22.251 --> 50:23.519
And I'm so sorry.

50:28.324 --> 50:31.161
It's just
because you're so precious...

50:32.996 --> 50:35.365
and I can't imagine my life
without you.

50:41.003 --> 50:42.338
We're soulmates.

52:36.353 --> 52:38.054
Okay, almost.

52:38.454 --> 52:40.322
- What are you doing?
- You'll see!

52:45.561 --> 52:46.530
All right, sit.

52:48.664 --> 52:51.301
- This is so weird.
- Keep them closed.

52:54.637 --> 52:55.505
Open 'em.

52:56.771 --> 52:57.706
A keyboard?

52:58.340 --> 52:59.275
Surprise!

52:59.675 --> 53:01.577
No way! Thank you!

53:02.110 --> 53:02.978
You like it?

53:03.512 --> 53:05.581
Yeah! Yeah, totally!

53:05.880 --> 53:07.483
I figured you needed something
to play on.

53:09.284 --> 53:10.152
Wow!

53:10.786 --> 53:12.188
You are so nice.

53:13.489 --> 53:15.025
I really want you
to be happy here.

53:15.925 --> 53:16.793
I am.

53:21.630 --> 53:22.532
You missed.

53:30.873 --> 53:31.740
Let me try it?

53:32.742 --> 53:33.610
Yeah!

54:07.175 --> 54:11.213
Whoo! Look at you,
sexy beast!

54:12.047 --> 54:13.750
You're hilarious.

54:18.922 --> 54:20.956
This is gonna be so much fun.

54:23.393 --> 54:26.492
You like having a sugar mama
that buys you things?

54:26.494 --> 54:27.797
Yes, thank you.

54:30.900 --> 54:31.934
Okay, you're the only one

54:32.467 --> 54:33.769
that could talk me into doing
something this ridiculous.

54:34.471 --> 54:36.806
Come on! Loosen up, big mama!

54:37.539 --> 54:38.407
Big mama?

54:38.907 --> 54:40.476
I mean sugar mama!

54:46.148 --> 54:47.182
Okay, let me see!

54:50.186 --> 54:51.054

Wow, we got homemade cake!
We got sushi! Living the life!

58:26.034 --> 58:29.170
I wish they had shit like this
where I'm staying right now.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.139
It's seems like they got
the same shit every two weeks.

58:31.740 --> 58:33.641
- You don't like where you live?
- It's all right.

58:33.909 --> 58:35.612
It's temporary
until I get my own place.

58:36.945 --> 58:38.681
Yeah, it's like
a glorified hospital.

58:39.815 --> 58:40.717
It's not that bad.

58:42.117 --> 58:43.318
Well, it's not this!

58:44.619 --> 58:46.355
I think I should know.
I'm the one stuck there.

58:47.822 --> 58:48.690
Anyway,

58:49.057 --> 58:50.356
they got these nurses there.

58:50.358 --> 58:52.392
The worst part is
they just hired dogs!

58:52.394 --> 58:54.994
It's nothin' but fat chicks
wearing pajamas and Crocs.

58:56.699 --> 58:58.867
These ladies take good care
of people, but, fuck!

58:59.168 --> 59:00.934
Who with an ounce
of self-respect goes out

59:00.936 --> 59:03.670
- in public wearing Crocs?
- Yeah! They're so ugly!

59:03.672 --> 59:06.273
Right? It's, like,
take some care of yourself!

59:06.275 --> 59:07.641
Fuck, seriously!

59:07.643 --> 59:09.045
They're actually
really comfortable.

59:10.346 --> 59:12.713
- What?
- I used to work in Crocs.

59:13.181 --> 59:15.682
Really?

59:15.684 --> 59:18.385
They're slip-resistant.

59:18.387 --> 59:19.389
Laura, fuck!

59:19.922 --> 59:21.523
Slip-resistant?

59:21.891 --> 59:23.657
Yo, I should rap
about that shit!

59:40.009 --> 59:40.876
No?

59:41.911 --> 59:44.746
Laura didn't tell you about me,
about her all-star big brother?

59:45.748 --> 59:46.682
No!

59:47.016 --> 59:48.414
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I rap a bit.

59:48.416 --> 59:49.585
You like hip hop?

59:49.952 --> 59:51.454
Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.

59:52.353 --> 59:53.422

59:54.023 --> 59:56.259

59:56.559 --> 59:57.827
Cool!

59:59.094 --> 01:00:01.195
Uh, I don't really know
the names.

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.431
I just know I like the music.

01:00:02.764 --> 01:00:04.365
I tell you what,
I make you a mixtape.

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:05.701
Thanks!

01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:08.137
Hey, wait!
You ever play in a band?

01:00:08.503 --> 01:00:09.771
Me? No. No.

01:00:10.072 --> 01:00:12.539
Well, I'm sayin',
you play piano, I write rhymes,

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:14.610
we should fucking make
some dope shit together!

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.577
Yeah! That... That'd be awesome!

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:18.412
Right!
I'll come by next week.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:19.713
We'll jam some shit out!

01:00:19.715 --> 01:00:21.280
Yeah!
That would be so cool.

01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:22.983
I've always wanted
to be in a band!

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:24.420

her head with a bunch of stupid

ideas, and I'm gonna have
to clean up your mess!

01:00:50.112 --> 01:00:51.577
What? What stupid ideas?

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:54.081

you ever fucking come over here!

What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:57.820
She doesn't listen to rap music,
okay?

01:00:58.119 --> 01:01:00.021
And she doesn't wanna be
in a stupid fucking band

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.253
- with you!
- What are you her mom

01:01:01.255 --> 01:01:02.588
or something?
We were just talking!

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:03.923
- Relax.
- You're not black, so stop

01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:05.291
- trying to sound like you are!
- And you're not

01:01:05.293 --> 01:01:06.360
a fuckin' teenager,

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:07.830
so maybe you should date
someone your own age!

01:01:09.297 --> 01:01:10.198

for an unforgettable evening!

Laura!

01:01:25.614 --> 01:01:27.613
You have no fucking respect
for me!

01:01:27.615 --> 01:01:28.815
What are you talking

01:01:28.817 --> 01:01:29.885
- about?
- You know exactly what I'm

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:31.586
talking about.
You ignored me all night!

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.519
You and my stupid
fucking brother!

01:01:33.521 --> 01:01:34.389
What?

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:35.923
I do everything for you!

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.292
I do everything for you!
It's my fucking birthday!

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.159
Laura, calm down!

01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:41.795
What do you think
you're gonna do, huh?

01:01:41.797 --> 01:01:42.996
- You gonna start a band?
- No.

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:44.264
Start singing fucking rap music?

01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:45.532
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:01:45.534 --> 01:01:46.835
Why wouldn't I?

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:51.637
Because I say what you can
and cannot do! That's why!

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.050
Laura?

01:02:38.052 --> 01:02:39.721
- No!
- Oh, God!

01:02:47.862 --> 01:02:49.531
I'm so stupid!

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:55.403
I'm so stupid!
I'm so stupid!

01:05:31.793 --> 01:05:36.132
Ah! You're pretty
when you laugh!

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.070
Ah!

01:05:43.371 --> 01:05:44.373
I mean,

01:05:44.706 --> 01:05:46.474
I think you're pretty
all the time, but...

01:05:54.382 --> 01:05:55.483
I think you're beautiful...

01:05:57.052 --> 01:05:57.920
actually.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.199
Go harder.

01:07:11.059 --> 01:07:11.927
Ow!

01:07:12.827 --> 01:07:13.661

I'm sorry.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.056
It's okay.

01:10:28.122 --> 01:10:29.155

01:10:32.327 --> 01:10:33.195
God!

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:35.331

01:10:36.331 --> 01:10:37.362
Remember me?

01:10:37.364 --> 01:10:38.665
- No!
- You fucking bitch!

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:39.668

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:43.271

01:10:43.838 --> 01:10:45.373
No!

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:47.743
No!

01:11:46.434 --> 01:11:47.970
Laura?

01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:20.935
Right here.

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:35.783
Oh God!

01:12:38.686 --> 01:12:39.555
I'm sorry.

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.694
- It's over there.
- Yeah, I see it.

01:13:07.682 --> 01:13:09.717
Are you sure you don't know
who they were?

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:15.257
Yeah.

01:13:22.396 --> 01:13:24.099
How about I just
drive you home...

01:13:26.234 --> 01:13:27.603
and get you settled in?

01:13:30.671 --> 01:13:32.205
I'm okay. I just need to rest.

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:33.673
I could
make you something, if you want.

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:34.710
You don't have to cook,
you know?

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.280
I just need to be alone
right now.

01:14:03.904 --> 01:14:06.774
Don't forget your pills.

01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:09.610
Thank you.

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:21.088
I'd kill those bastards
if I could, Laura.

01:14:22.056 --> 01:14:23.559
I would goddamn kill them!

01:14:32.466 --> 01:14:33.568
Thank you for the lift.

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:35.735
Okay.

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:36.604
I'll, uh,

01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.072
I'll call you later.

01:14:39.573 --> 01:14:40.509
Okay.

01:15:47.007 --> 01:15:47.876
Laura?

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:50.411
Oh my God!

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.411
- I'm okay.
- Laura, what happened?

01:15:52.413 --> 01:15:53.380
I'm okay.

01:15:54.215 --> 01:15:55.982
You don't look okay!

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:57.019
I just need to sit down.

01:15:59.886 --> 01:16:00.889
Could you get me some water?

01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:02.858
Yeah! Yeah, of course!

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:09.798
Thank you.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.701
Laura, please tell me
what happened.

01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:17.739
I was in...

01:16:18.673 --> 01:16:20.876
the hospital
because I got beaten up.

01:16:21.775 --> 01:16:22.644
By who?

01:16:25.412 --> 01:16:26.280
By my...

01:16:26.914 --> 01:16:27.882
By my dad.

01:16:29.984 --> 01:16:30.852
What?

01:16:31.485 --> 01:16:32.354
Why?

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:37.259
Because he tried to touch me.

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:39.559
Touch you.

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:41.296
And I wouldn't let him.

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.030
Touch you how?

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.235
In a way that...

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:50.439
a father's not supposed
to touch his own daughter.

01:16:52.606 --> 01:16:53.574
Oh my God!

01:16:56.543 --> 01:16:58.878
And I just don't understand,
you know, because I thought that

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.615
that stopped a long time ago.

01:17:06.953 --> 01:17:08.489
What did he do?

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:14.963
I had to go to my dad's house.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.701
I was showing him
something on the computer.

01:17:21.301 --> 01:17:23.337
And then he tried
to...

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:29.810
but I wouldn't let him.

01:17:32.113 --> 01:17:35.017
And so he hit me,
and he wouldn't stop.

01:17:40.154 --> 01:17:41.987
How did you get away?
How did you get to the hospital?

01:17:41.989 --> 01:17:43.291
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

01:17:44.592 --> 01:17:46.127
- Did... Did you call the police?
- No.

01:17:47.795 --> 01:17:49.161
How come?
Look what he did to you!

01:17:49.163 --> 01:17:50.364
No. It's finished, okay?

01:17:50.965 --> 01:17:51.800
I don't want to.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.602
He can't get away with this.

01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:55.334
- Laura! He can't get away...
- I don't wanna call anybody.

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:56.338
...with this.
Please okay.

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.437
- You need to call the police!
- I don't wanna call the fucking

01:17:58.439 --> 01:18:00.074
police, okay? Just stop!

01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:09.184
I'm sorry.

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:17.858
I don't have anybody else
in the world, okay?

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:21.328
Just you.

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.836
Will you please take
care of me? Please?

01:18:30.104 --> 01:18:32.840
Yeah, of course. Of course.
Of course.

01:18:37.645 --> 01:18:40.648
You're my angel.
Oh God!

01:21:07.228 --> 01:21:08.697
You're almost done
with that inventory?

01:21:09.396 --> 01:21:10.265
Mm-hmm.

01:21:15.168 --> 01:21:16.203
Wanna give it to me?

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:18.506
Thanks.

01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:21.542
Oh!

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.012
Are you ready for tonight?

01:21:26.313 --> 01:21:27.782
I... I can't make it tonight.

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:30.917
Why not?

01:21:31.385 --> 01:21:32.354
'Cause I already got plans.

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:34.588
What are they?

01:21:35.222 --> 01:21:36.091
Nothing.

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:37.692
Tell me!

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:39.327
Stop prying.

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.026
Well, as your father,

01:21:41.028 --> 01:21:42.764
I'm naturally curious
about what you're doing.

01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:46.067
Really? At my age,
is that natural?

01:21:48.002 --> 01:21:48.870
Yes, I think so.

01:21:50.203 --> 01:21:51.905
Well, don't think too hard.
You might hurt yourself.

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.048
Yeah!

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:01.917
Uh...

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:03.518
no, tomorrow's fine.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.718
Yeah, tomorrow,
but not next week.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.089
Right? Tomorrow.
Yeah, just tell them that.

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:10.324
Okay.

01:22:10.724 --> 01:22:11.993
All right, bye.

01:22:14.762 --> 01:22:16.163
- She's my lover.
- Sorry?

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.430
I can't go tonight
because I'm having dinner

01:22:19.432 --> 01:22:20.734
- with my lover.
- Your lover?

01:22:21.234 --> 01:22:22.170
Yeah.

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.637
- Hard to imagine, isn't it?
- No, it's just,

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.571
it sounds so serious
when you say it like that.

01:22:26.573 --> 01:22:27.775
Well, it is.

01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:31.246
And believe it or not,
she really loves me too.

01:22:33.079 --> 01:22:34.114
I'm sure she does.

01:22:37.751 --> 01:22:39.988
- And we live together.
- Oh, you live together!

01:22:41.889 --> 01:22:43.421
How long have you
even known each other?

01:22:43.423 --> 01:22:44.723
- Long enough.
- How come I didn't know

01:22:44.725 --> 01:22:46.224
- about this?
- Why the fuck would you?

01:22:46.226 --> 01:22:47.692
I mean, what kind
of trouble have you gotten

01:22:47.694 --> 01:22:49.027
- yourself into now?
- I haven't gotten myself into

01:22:49.029 --> 01:22:49.929
- anything!
- No?

01:22:50.363 --> 01:22:52.399
You mean you didn't
have to stalk this one?

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:56.300
- Fuck you!
- Laura!

01:22:56.302 --> 01:22:57.503
- No fuck you!
- Shh. Be quiet!

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:58.670
- Keep your voice down.
- What is this...

01:22:58.672 --> 01:23:00.205
What is this about, huh?
Are you jealous?

01:23:00.207 --> 01:23:01.209
- Why would I...
- Are you jealous

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:02.977
- that I found someone?
- Why would I be goddamn jealous?

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:04.876
- I'm worried is what I am!
- What are you worried about?

01:23:04.878 --> 01:23:06.479
What do you think
I'm worried about?

01:23:06.814 --> 01:23:08.246
- Come in here.
- Look it is no business

01:23:08.248 --> 01:23:09.748
of yours what I do
in my own home.

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:11.051
Oh yes? Your home?

01:23:11.418 --> 01:23:12.920
You'd be on the goddamn street

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.956
if I didn't buy that home
for you!

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.295
Okay, you know what?

01:23:21.962 --> 01:23:24.499
Fuck you and fuck this job!

01:23:25.198 --> 01:23:26.201
So I quit!

01:23:27.467 --> 01:23:28.336
Good!

01:23:28.935 --> 01:23:30.572
Run away like you always do!

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.150
- Here you go.
- Oh God!

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.119
This looks amazing.

01:25:26.953 --> 01:25:27.855
I hope it's good.

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:30.692
Thank you for making this.

01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:36.930
Cheers!

01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:38.500
Cheers!

01:25:45.472 --> 01:25:47.774
This is so nice.

01:25:50.644 --> 01:25:51.646
Who's that?

01:25:53.579 --> 01:25:54.615
I have no idea.

01:25:58.484 --> 01:25:59.319
Shit!

01:26:00.087 --> 01:26:01.956
- Who is it?
- It's my dad.

01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:04.826
What the fuck does he want?

01:26:05.525 --> 01:26:06.426
I don't know. Just

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.295
give me two seconds, okay?

01:26:10.831 --> 01:26:12.097
Hi, sweetie.

01:26:12.099 --> 01:26:13.165
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:14.601
Yeah, I... I tried to call but,

01:26:15.168 --> 01:26:16.602
I guess you're a little busy.

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:18.640
- You know goddamn well I'm busy!
- I know, I know.

01:26:19.673 --> 01:26:21.005
What are you doing here?

01:26:21.007 --> 01:26:23.275
I'm really sorry
about the argument we had

01:26:23.277 --> 01:26:24.845
and the things that I said.
That was stupid,

01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:26.381
stupid idiotic things.

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:28.215
I don't care about your apology,

01:26:28.481 --> 01:26:29.750
and I don't take back
what I said.

01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:31.219
- Are you done now?
- Laura, please!

01:26:31.685 --> 01:26:34.255
Just give me a second, please.
I have something else to say.

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.993
And I'm very sorry
to bring this up now...

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:41.028
but...

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.503
I can't bear the weight
of it anymore,

01:26:48.869 --> 01:26:51.171
and, um,
I think it's eating us alive.

01:26:51.537 --> 01:26:52.406
And...

01:26:53.707 --> 01:26:54.576
I...

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:56.044
I...

01:26:58.177 --> 01:27:00.879
I live with guilt and remorse
every single day.

01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:03.351
Those things that happened
between us should never,

01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:06.520
ever have happened,
and I want to apologize to you.

01:27:12.893 --> 01:27:15.697
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, of course not!

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.302
Why are you doing this now?

01:27:23.837 --> 01:27:26.103
Why now, when you know
I have someone over?

01:27:26.105 --> 01:27:28.005
There's never a good time
for something like this.

01:27:28.007 --> 01:27:28.876
Oh no, this is...

01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:32.613
Definitely the absolute
worst fucking time!

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:34.713
- I'm sorry, angel.
- I didn't mean to ruin

01:27:34.715 --> 01:27:36.113
your evening, I promise.

01:27:36.115 --> 01:27:38.719
- Bullshit!
- I just... Laura, please!

01:27:39.185 --> 01:27:40.420
I need to say this.

01:27:41.721 --> 01:27:42.657
I am sorry!

01:27:43.856 --> 01:27:44.891
I am sorry!

01:27:46.225 --> 01:27:47.161
I am sorry!

01:27:52.733 --> 01:27:54.202
Do you think you could
ever forgive me?

01:28:04.845 --> 01:28:05.712
Are you okay?

01:28:06.046 --> 01:28:07.446
I'm fine. Just give me a minute,

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:08.781
- okay?
- You don't look okay.

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:09.817
I'm fine.

01:28:10.083 --> 01:28:11.517
We're trying to have
a private conversation.

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:12.451
- Please.
- What do you want?

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.520
- Eva.
- What are you...

01:28:13.953 --> 01:28:15.353
- What are you doing here?
- Actually, I need to speak

01:28:15.355 --> 01:28:16.754
- with my daughter. Please!
- Why don't you just

01:28:16.756 --> 01:28:19.224
leave her alone! Okay.
Haven't you done enough damage?

01:28:19.226 --> 01:28:21.326
- Excuse me?
- You're a fucking pervert!

01:28:21.328 --> 01:28:22.429
- Eva!
- What?

01:28:22.962 --> 01:28:23.831
Oh!

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:25.600
Jesus Christ!

01:28:27.134 --> 01:28:29.902
Don't you ever disrespect
my father like that again!

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:32.640
- I was just trying to help you.
- I don't need your fucking help!

01:28:37.411 --> 01:28:39.143
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

01:28:48.989 --> 01:28:50.457
I don't know
what I was thinking...

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.994
I shouldn't have
come here like this.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:55.823
This is shit.

01:29:58.725 --> 01:29:59.926
All of this is shit.

01:30:05.298 --> 01:30:06.868
And you don't deserve any of it.

01:30:44.904 --> 01:30:46.474
You don't deserve
any of this either.

01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:51.244
You don't.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:49.904
- Where are you going?
- Just getting some water.

01:32:26.506 --> 01:32:27.508
Come here.

01:33:06.246 --> 01:33:08.082
I just need to feel your warmth.

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:32.660
<i>Eva!</i>

01:35:56.917 --> 01:36:00.121
Everybody,
please get out of the pool.

01:36:01.954 --> 01:36:02.823
Eva!

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:05.626
Eva!

01:38:43.449 --> 01:38:44.318
Laura!

01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:46.420
Come in!

01:38:48.421 --> 01:38:49.322
I'm not staying.

01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:53.594
Well, okay.
I wasn't expecting you.

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.469
Are you okay?

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:09.243
I'm alone.

01:39:12.979 --> 01:39:13.847
I'm...

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.548
completely

01:39:16.216 --> 01:39:17.084
alone.

01:39:21.721 --> 01:39:22.889
And I'm okay with that.

01:39:25.625 --> 01:39:26.560
I will be.

01:39:34.701 --> 01:39:37.671
But I don't want anything
anymore, and, uh...

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:43.911
I don't want anybody around me.

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.486
'Cause I can't do it anymore.

01:39:55.654 --> 01:39:56.556
Honey!
