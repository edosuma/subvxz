WEBVTT

00:07.500 --> 00:10.367
MAN: This was the morning
of Kara Anderson's death.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.538
MAN 2: I guess I should have
known something was wrong.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.208
She wanted to go sit
in her room a minute.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.377
I didn't know she
was saying good-bye.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.810
YOUNGER MAN: I asked her
about studying together,

00:20.850 --> 00:23.785
but she wanted to be
in the sun all day.

00:30.690 --> 00:34.490
MAN 1:
This was the morning
of Kara Anderson's death,

00:34.530 --> 00:37.499
because she chose it.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.483
(doorbell rings)

00:56.520 --> 00:58.511
Come in.

01:00.790 --> 01:02.348
Hey.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.652
Hey.

01:03.690 --> 01:06.750
Oh, you look pretty good
for an out-of-work loser.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.166
(laughs)
I'm almost done.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.462
You heading
straight to court?
Yep.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.559
So how you handling it
one week in?

01:12.600 --> 01:14.295
I'm devastated--
getting up

01:14.340 --> 01:16.205
at 9:00 instead of 5:00,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.162
going to the gym
instead of racing to court.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.632
I miss the law too much.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.308
_ You're not
coming back, are you?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.477
I haven't checked my
cell phone in two hours.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.341
You know what that feels like?

01:26.380 --> 01:27.847
Well, you are
missed at work.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.381
I doubt that.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.546
David Lee is
probably calculating

01:30.590 --> 01:32.558
my square footage
right now.

01:32.590 --> 01:33.818
Okay, the disciplinary
board says

01:33.860 --> 01:35.487
I can consult on
any case strategy

01:35.520 --> 01:36.851
developed before
my suspension.

01:36.890 --> 01:39.393
So tell Alicia I made
notes on this petition,

01:39.430 --> 01:41.193
but I_ can't
on thIs one.
You sure?

01:41.230 --> 01:42.527
That's the one she needs.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.559
Those are the rules.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.192
How's she doing?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.663
Oh, worried.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.258
Overwhelmed.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.767
Tell her Judge Serena
likes women

01:49.810 --> 01:51.232
more than men anyway.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.806
And watch out with the client.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.775
He'll talk too much and get
pretentious on the stand.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.243
Will, when I leave,
you're not going to curl up

02:00.280 --> 02:02.589
into a little ball and cry,
are you?

02:02.620 --> 02:03.587
Tears of joy and relaxation.

02:03.620 --> 02:06.180
You really think you can
do this for six months?

02:06.220 --> 02:07.551
In a walk.
Okay.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.421
Call me when you crash.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.751
*

02:41.820 --> 02:44.926
I'm sorry.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.622
This is hard for me,
and I'm...

02:47.660 --> 02:49.628
I'm just a girl
from Michigan.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.366
I can't imagine what
it's like for you.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.265
Yeah, just the thought
of my daughter

02:54.300 --> 02:55.790
out there in this movie, it...

02:55.840 --> 02:57.569
But you agreed to an interview?
Yes.

02:57.610 --> 03:01.706
Our daughter had just died,
and she...

03:03.280 --> 03:04.679
He said that this documentary

03:04.710 --> 03:06.849
was an attempt
to keep people

03:06.880 --> 03:08.370
from committing
suicide,

03:08.420 --> 03:09.614
and it's just to make money.

03:09.650 --> 03:10.617
ALICIA:
Objection.

03:10.650 --> 03:11.685
Your Honor, opinion.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.278
CROZIER: To me,
Your Honor, this is

03:13.320 --> 03:14.548
the whole point of the case.

03:14.590 --> 03:16.729
This is a wrongful death suit.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.854
And he sold this movie
as an anti-suicide documentary

03:19.900 --> 03:23.495
when, in fact, it was intended
to induce and encourage suicide.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.725
ALICIA:
Not "in fact,"
Your Honor.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.589
In opinion.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.733
And I wish you would
admonish Ms. Crozier

03:28.770 --> 03:31.000
for constantly summarizing
her case to the jury.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.473
This is
the equivalent

03:32.510 --> 03:34.831
of advertising
through repetition.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.507
I don't even know
what that means.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.869
I...

03:37.910 --> 03:39.775
I'm just speaking
from the heart.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.242
SERENA:
Thank you very much,

03:41.280 --> 03:42.349
both of you.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.584
I take your objections to heart.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.679
Legally you're
on equal footing,

03:45.720 --> 03:48.314
and so I think we should
continue with the testimony.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.850
CROZIER:
Thank you,
Your Honor.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.619
We would love
to continue

03:51.660 --> 03:53.719
with the testimony.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.694
He could only make notes
on the past strategy.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.027
Got it.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.560
How is he?
Good.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.669
Strangely good.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.429
He was wondering
how you're doing.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.859
CROZIER:
So, when you decided to speak
to him, you didn't know

04:03.910 --> 04:05.764
that he had film of your
daughter committing suicide?

04:05.810 --> 04:06.834
MAN:
That's right.
He lied to us.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.632
CROZIER:
And that would have
changed your mind

04:08.680 --> 04:10.705
about the interview?
Yes, definitely.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.411
We didn't want
our daughter's death

04:12.450 --> 04:13.712
to be turned into a circus.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.672
CROZIER:
Now, I just... I have
to play it again

04:15.720 --> 04:18.712
just up to there.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.012
What is your daughter
doing here?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.709
She's staring into the camera.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.954
CROZIER:
And before this day,

04:22.990 --> 04:24.855
had she ever expressed
suicidal thoughts?

04:24.890 --> 04:25.857
MAN:
No, never.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.788
CROZIER:
Then why did she do it?

04:26.830 --> 04:29.628
Because there were cameras
on that bridge.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.422
He wanted her,

04:31.470 --> 04:33.392
or someone like
her, to jump

04:33.440 --> 04:34.964
so that he could film it
and sell his film.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.605
Objection, Your Honor.
Calls for speculation.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.437
We will withdraw that,
Your Honor.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.731
I'm sorry, Frank.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.701
I know it's difficult

04:41.740 --> 04:42.968
after everything that
you've been through

04:43.010 --> 04:45.877
not to speak from the heart,

04:45.910 --> 04:48.777
but in court,
we do have to go by the rules.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.448
Let me ask something
I think Mrs. Florrick

04:51.490 --> 04:53.708
will allow me to ask.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.081
Do you see that there?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.883
Yes.
And what
do you see?

04:57.930 --> 04:59.420
The camera
zooming In.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.552
Which tells you what?

05:00.600 --> 05:01.692
That he was more interested
In getting

05:01.730 --> 05:04.324
a good shot than he was
in saving my daughter's life.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.894
ALICIA:
Just listen, Aidan.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.568
She's going to try
and draw you

05:07.600 --> 05:08.828
into a conversation
about fIlmmakIng.

05:08.870 --> 05:09.837
Don't go there.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.338
The jury won't like it
if you talk about shots.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.836
I have to answer
the questions.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.677
You have to answer
"yes" or "no."

05:15.710 --> 05:17.007
You don't have to elaborate.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.678
Talk about why
you made the film.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.119
Why you care about suicide.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.811
Maybe we should
delay the trial

05:22.850 --> 05:24.112
and wait for Will
to come back.

05:24.150 --> 05:25.947
Aidan, listen to me.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.515
I've worked on this case
just as long as WIll has.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.721
He's given the case to Alicia
because he trusts her.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.455
The judge doesn't
trust her.
Doesn't matter.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.797
It's who
the jury trusts.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.491
That's why you need to...

05:35.530 --> 05:38.693
Not get drawn into a
conversation about aesthetics.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.095
Good. Right.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.892
Okay, take a deep breath.

05:44.610 --> 05:45.861
Eli, I am already
triple-tasked

05:45.910 --> 05:47.104
with this trial as it is.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.732
I can't do any more...

05:48.780 --> 05:49.701
I'm not asking.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.944
This isn't about work.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.516
It's about you and Peter.

05:52.550 --> 05:54.415
Eli, can we do this later?

05:54.450 --> 05:56.816
We're meeting with
Donna Brazile this afternoon.

05:56.850 --> 05:59.455
She is going to decide
if Peter is the keynote speaker

05:59.490 --> 06:01.048
at the Democratic Convention.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.821
Really?
Really.

06:03.860 --> 06:06.727
Hey, I am a good
campaign strategist.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.763
But I need to know if
you're divorcmg Peter.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.394
Donna Brazile will not
agree to the keynote

06:12.440 --> 06:13.634
if you are.
She won't...?

06:13.670 --> 06:15.797
Uh, it's none of her business.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.603
David Lee says he's
your divorce attorney.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.107
Wait.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.835
David Lee said what?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.405
He said that he is
your divorce attorney.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.644
Two weeks ago.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.773
He said that, due to
attorney-client privilege,

06:26.820 --> 06:27.912
he can't say much.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.486
He can't say anything.
I know.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.078
And I think
you know

06:31.120 --> 06:32.678
that David Lee is not

06:32.720 --> 06:34.119
the greatest respecter
of the niceties.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.718
So... (sighs)

06:35.760 --> 06:37.557
I just worry
that if he tells me,

06:37.590 --> 06:38.818
he'll tell more people.

06:40.630 --> 06:41.858
What?

06:42.900 --> 06:44.720
All right.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.795
We're back to you
manipulating me.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.467
No. No.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.104
I just thought you should know

06:50.140 --> 06:52.165
what David Lee is saying
behind your back.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.833
DIANE: _
I'm just saying,

06:54.880 --> 06:56.905
I discussed it
with the disciplinary board.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.100
Due to the fact
that you are a name partner

06:59.150 --> 07:01.038
and therefore have
busmess Interests here,

07:01.080 --> 07:03.685
they have allowed you
access to your office.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.449
So come back, Little Sheba.

07:05.490 --> 07:06.787
WILL:
You hear that, Diane?

07:06.820 --> 07:08.549
That's the sound of chapter five

07:08.590 --> 07:10.228
being finished.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.490
A Failure of Principle:

07:12.530 --> 07:15.226
War's Impact
on Supreme Court Decisions.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.966
It sounds like a best seller.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.888
Why don't you write
your magnum opus here?

07:18.930 --> 07:20.898
We miss you, Will.
(doorbell rings)

07:20.940 --> 07:21.861
I miss you.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.003
Come by here.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.632
It's quiet here.

07:24.670 --> 07:25.830
It's peaceful.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.235
Yeah, I'm tempted.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.577
We'll talk.

07:28.610 --> 07:29.804
Good-bye.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.772
Okay, one at a time.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.914
Hey, Willy. Guess who.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.986
I... What are
you doing here?

07:38.020 --> 07:40.511
Making you feel better!

07:40.560 --> 07:41.515
I heard you got fired.
I didn't get fired.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.926
So I got on an airplane
and I rushed out here.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.552
That's what sisters do.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.727
Mm-hmm. And how long

07:46.760 --> 07:48.227
are you thinking of...
Of staying?

07:48.260 --> 07:50.660
Long as it takes
to get you back on your feet.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.550
Diane, do you have a minute?

08:13.590 --> 08:14.887
I know. We're all under stress.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.285
I'm looking for someone

08:16.320 --> 08:17.582
to join you in
Hﬁgaﬁon.
No.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.518
Uh, well, yes,
that's a part of it.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.697
I'm hoping to
hire someone

08:20.730 --> 08:21.628
in the next two weeks.

08:21.660 --> 08:22.922
Uh, we just have to move

08:22.970 --> 08:25.029
for as many continuances
as we can.
Yes.

08:25.070 --> 08:28.665
And, uh, fortunately, we haven't
lost any of Will's clients.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.065
Mm-hmm.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.034
Okay, so that's
part of it?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.968
What's the other part?

08:35.010 --> 08:37.205
Nature abhors a vacuum.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.241
So does our letterhead.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.249
I want to replace Will
on the letterhead,

08:42.280 --> 08:44.544
and I want to take his office.

08:45.590 --> 08:46.716
Really?

08:46.760 --> 08:47.818
Yes.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.078
I'm taking on half his load,
a third of his clients.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.757
And what about Will?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.793
Well, I think it's just
realistic to assume

08:56.830 --> 08:59.264
that when he comes back,
he'll have to struggle

08:59.300 --> 09:02.235
to reclaim the respect
and business of his clients.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.302
So you want to be
a name partner.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.364
I do.

09:06.410 --> 09:09.174
I think I've made that clear
from the beginning.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.349
_ I think this
IS an opportune moment

09:11.380 --> 09:12.813
to make that shift.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.981
Caitlin, how are you?

09:24.030 --> 09:25.122
Hi. Good.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.229
How are you?

09:26.260 --> 09:27.693
Good.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.197
I think I'm going
to need your help

09:29.230 --> 09:30.663
in the next few days.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.191
Sure-- anything
you need.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.870
Yes.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.744
But didn't you want the images

09:51.790 --> 09:53.655
to have the beauty
of your heroes?

09:53.690 --> 09:55.317
Martin Scorsese.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.328
Right?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.828
That's what you said
in your deposition.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.259
He did Hugo, right?

10:01.300 --> 10:02.927
Ah, I loved Hugo.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.198
(chuckles)

10:04.230 --> 10:05.299
Yes, he did do Hugo.

10:05.330 --> 10:10.029
But he also does very violent
films that you love.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.731
Gang movies.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.078
Yes, he makes gang movies.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.032
CROZIER: And isn't that
what this was about?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.775
The beauty of violence?

10:16.810 --> 10:18.072
No.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.647
Could you extrapolate?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.648
No.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.214
No further questions.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.782
Aidan.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.288
Was your cameraman
zooming in on this shot

10:34.330 --> 10:37.663
instead of keeping Kara
from committing suicide?

10:37.700 --> 10:38.667
No. There was no cameraman.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.928
We just locked off a camera

10:39.970 --> 10:41.369
and digitally fed it to
the production office.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.765
Well, then,
how is it zooming in?

10:42.810 --> 10:43.765
It's not.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.437
We did that in the editing room.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.335
We can digitally
make it look like that

10:47.380 --> 10:49.405
to imitate a zoom.
ALICIA: You didn't want Kara

10:49.440 --> 10:50.372
to commit suicide?
AIDAN: No.

10:50.410 --> 10:54.346
My aunt committed suicide.

10:54.380 --> 10:58.885
I found her dead in our garage
when I was eight.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.354
I know what
you're going through.

11:01.390 --> 11:03.381
That's why I wanted
to make this movie.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.455
To wake people up
to the warning signs

11:05.490 --> 11:07.754
that someone in their family
might commit suicide.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.394
And what did you do
when you saw

11:10.430 --> 11:13.433
on the digital feed
someone intending to jump?

11:13.470 --> 11:14.368
I called 911, of course.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.459
CROZIER:
Objection, Your Honor,

11:16.500 --> 11:18.263
counsel has produced
no record of this call.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.369
It's not in evidence.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.434
Ms. Crozier has a good point.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.471
Bring in proof
of this 911 call,

11:23.510 --> 11:24.499
then you can put it
in the record.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.769
The difficulty is, the City
erases all 911 calls

11:27.820 --> 11:29.173
after 30 days.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.881
Can you get it
from the 911 operator?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.717
Possibly, but I'm not
getting much cooperation

11:32.760 --> 11:33.749
from Cook County.

11:33.790 --> 11:34.984
Even Cary?

11:35.020 --> 11:37.022
Especially Cary.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.925
PETER: I'm not going to talk
about my marriage.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.996
ELI: I know, but if she asks
about your marriage,

11:41.030 --> 11:43.464
just say every relationship
has a few bumps,

11:43.500 --> 11:45.058
but you're working things out.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.397
Peter, do you want the keynote?

11:46.430 --> 11:48.068
I want to not sound
like an idiot.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.409
Well, put it into your own
words, then, but be vague.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.407
I'm not gonna lie.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.408
It's not lying.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.475
Aren't you working
things out?

11:54.510 --> 11:56.068
I don't know what we're doing.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.873
That's working things out.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.207
Mr. Florrick, how are you?

11:59.250 --> 12:00.239
Ms. Brazile,

12:00.280 --> 12:01.440
it's a pleasure.
Call me Donna.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.482
Donna, I respect
you mightily.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.284
Oh, come on, you do not.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.356
I'm just a pain in the ass.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.325
(laughs) Well, I respect
pains in the ass the most.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.248
Speaking of Eli,
hello, Eli.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.995
Yes, sure, make me the butt
of your jokes.

12:15.030 --> 12:16.258
So, Donna,

12:16.300 --> 12:18.427
I want the keynote.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.267
What do I have
to do to get it?

12:20.300 --> 12:21.528
Impress me.

12:21.570 --> 12:22.730
Why do you want it?

12:22.770 --> 12:26.308
I want to talk about a country
that gives second chances.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.798
It gave me a second chance
to do some good.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.109
I had to tell him I'll
announce when I'm ready to.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.209
BRAZILE:
Why do people not like him?

12:35.250 --> 12:37.389
Peter? People like Peter.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.047
I called around
to check up on him,

12:39.090 --> 12:40.819
no one speaks up for him.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.088
Depends on who you call.
No, it doesn't.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.224
I called his supporters,
or I thought they were

12:44.260 --> 12:45.522
his supporters.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.926
VVho?
I'm not doing your
job for you, Eli.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.496
Help me out.

12:49.530 --> 12:51.566
I want him to speak
at the convention,

12:51.600 --> 12:54.865
but you need to get some
people to support him.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.492
Support breeds support.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.538
We should_ start
our own musrc group.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.502
A brother
and sister group.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.142
You don't like
being a lavwer anyway.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.317
What are you
talking about?

13:08.350 --> 13:09.339
Yeah, I do.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.881
No, you don't; you never did.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.444
You only did it
'cause Dad wanted you to.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.219
I did it because it was
a smart thing to do.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.409
So, you did it;
now do something else.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.825
You_know I have
a bIg firm now?

13:16.860 --> 13:17.656
Now, I know you guys think

13:17.690 --> 13:19.248
I'm just some schmuck
in Chicago,

13:19.290 --> 13:21.451
but I have 300 employees
waiting on my word.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.127
Sounds great.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.364
(laughs)

13:24.400 --> 13:26.994
I swear, I could win
the Nobel Prize,

13:27.040 --> 13:29.031
and you'd still think
I gave up my calling.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.468
You didn't call Sara, did you?

13:34.510 --> 13:35.875
Sara, our sister?

13:35.910 --> 13:37.502
Why would I call her?
You did.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.006
I didn't.
Come on, Aubrey.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.278
I got work to do around here.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.378
She'll just boss me around.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.218
I did not call her.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.554
Okay, I did.

13:47.590 --> 13:49.455
But I knew ifI didn't,

13:49.490 --> 13:50.457
she'd kill me.

13:50.490 --> 13:51.582
(sighs)

13:51.630 --> 13:52.858
When is she arriving?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.197
Her flight, in about an hour.

13:54.230 --> 13:55.891
I told her
you'd pick her up.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.466
(phone ringing)

13:57.500 --> 13:59.627
Hello?

13:59.670 --> 14:01.888
Hey, it's me;
I'm just checking in.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.601
Hi, how's it going?

14:03.640 --> 14:05.130
Good. Our client did well
on the stand.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.307
Thanks for the advice.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.602
No problem.
Who's that?

14:07.640 --> 14:09.073
You've got your sweet voice on.

14:09.110 --> 14:10.145
Shh, I do not.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.204
AUBREY:
Yes, you do.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.603
I, um...

14:12.650 --> 14:15.369
Will, I just wanted
to ask, um...

14:15.420 --> 14:17.388
I think they're putting
the editor on next.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.149
You think it's
an easy objection?

14:19.190 --> 14:20.555
Tyler v. Hasserbach.
It's a cinch.

14:20.590 --> 14:23.184
Okay, thanks, bye.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.221
CROZIER:
So, you edit

14:25.260 --> 14:26.579
this stuff together?

14:26.630 --> 14:28.655
The film?
Yes, uh, with the director.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.668
We place the music where it is,

14:30.700 --> 14:33.260
and we also manipulate
the images.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.564
So, can you tell us how some
of the images were manipulated?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.465
Objection, Your Honor,
relevance?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.138
The images were manipulated
to romanticize suicide.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.602
Even if what Ms. Crozier

14:41.640 --> 14:42.971
is saying is true, Your Honor...

14:43.010 --> 14:44.307
Your Honor?

14:44.350 --> 14:46.147
The images were the result

14:46.180 --> 14:48.614
of Kara's suicide,
not the cause.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.948
Tyler v. Hasserbach.
Yes, except

14:50.990 --> 14:53.481
for the YouTube promo put
on the Internet by your client.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.556
Why don't we let this go
on a bit, Mrs. Florrick?

14:55.590 --> 14:56.921
Overruled.
So,

14:56.960 --> 14:58.587
during the editing,
did Mr. Stoddard

14:58.630 --> 15:00.495
ever voice concern
about the pr0ject?

15:00.530 --> 15:02.555
EDITOR:
Yes, uh, he was afraid

15:02.600 --> 15:04.397
there wasn't enough footage
from the suicide bridge.

15:04.430 --> 15:08.366
There's usually 15 suicides
a year from that bridge.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.459
Uh, he had his cameras up
for nine months,

15:10.510 --> 15:11.966
but there was only one.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.079
This one.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.578
Yes, Cynthia Caracetti.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.943
So, Mr. Stoddard decided
to create a YouTube video?

15:18.980 --> 15:20.242
Yes, to gain

15:20.280 --> 15:22.942
attention, that's what he said.

15:22.990 --> 15:23.740
I needed financing,
that's all.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.384
So, how did you
manipulate the image

15:26.420 --> 15:28.684
of this young woman
committing suicide?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.655
We digitally enhanced the slq,
making it softer,

15:31.690 --> 15:32.486
bluer.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.226
Those clouds were added,
and we, uh,

15:35.260 --> 15:37.125
added some greenery
to the trees.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.398
I see.

15:38.430 --> 15:40.295
Is this the original image?

15:40.340 --> 15:44.037
Yes, oh, and, uh, we added
mist to the waterfall.

15:44.070 --> 15:46.402
Excuse me, that's what
filmmakers do, beautify.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.702
Mr. Stoddard,
that's enough, please.

15:47.740 --> 15:50.072
CROZIER:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now, let's discuss the music.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.145
How did Mr. Stoddard

15:51.180 --> 15:53.614
choose the music?
AIdan

15:53.650 --> 15:57.188
wanted the, uh, most romantic
and sad music possible.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.017
And how many songs
did you try against it?

15:59.050 --> 16:00.256
I don't know, uh, 30.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.450
We tried

16:01.490 --> 16:04.220
the Celine Dion song
"My Heart Will Go On."

16:04.260 --> 16:06.023
But it was too expensive.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.459
And after the YouTube video

16:07.500 --> 16:08.728
was posted on the Internet,

16:08.760 --> 16:10.990
how many suicides were there?

16:11.030 --> 16:13.498
Our cameras caught five
in the next two months.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.588
ELI:
Come on, Horton.
I'm not saying I did.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.709
I'm not saying I didn't.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.508
Donna Brazile called me.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.575
I was honest.

16:22.610 --> 16:25.499
I used to like Peter,
but I think he's lost his way.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.108
How has he lost his way?

16:27.150 --> 16:28.310
He thinks he can

16:28.350 --> 16:30.045
go it on his own,
so be my guest.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.387
Meaning he didn't
offer you a position

16:31.420 --> 16:32.614
in the state‘s
attorney's office.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.686
He didn't offer me
anything.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.551
It's a bad economy.

16:36.590 --> 16:38.729
I had to accept a job
at a think tank.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.352
It isn't just me.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.721
There are people that got
Peter Florrick elected,

16:42.760 --> 16:44.261
and he didn't return the favor.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.689
He's trying to run
a clean office, Horton.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.766
He's basing hiring on merit.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.507
Well, that's how you offend
a friend, isn't it?

16:51.540 --> 16:53.428
I guess I don't merit.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.131
They call it patronage
for a reason, Eli.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.738
You want a favor,

16:57.780 --> 16:59.668
you want me to praise Peter
to Donna Brazile,

16:59.710 --> 17:03.111
I want a job.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.657
Mrs. Florrick?

17:10.690 --> 17:11.725
You needed me?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.524
Yes, Caitlin, you know
how we're all short-handed

17:14.560 --> 17:15.788
around here
with Mr. Gardner out

17:15.830 --> 17:16.751
and everyone picking up
the slack?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.427
Yes, how is Mr. Gardner?

17:18.470 --> 17:19.528
He's good.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.832
Um, you're up on
the Aidan Stoddard case?

17:20.870 --> 17:22.690
I am; I think it's fascinating.
Good.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.832
I need you in court today.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.168
In what capacity?

17:26.210 --> 17:27.472
Cross-examination.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.771
Mrs. Florrick, I...

17:30.810 --> 17:32.141
This will be my first time.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.374
I know.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.776
You did well in arbitration,
and everyone needs a first time.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.789
Caitlin, you can do this,
believe me.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.129
Okay, if that's what you want.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.479
No, I think it's a good idea.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.122
Is she ready for court?

17:47.160 --> 17:49.492
You don't put fruit
in the refrigerator, Will.

17:49.530 --> 17:50.861
You just buy new fruit.

17:50.900 --> 17:54.461
Good, the key is getting
the Facebook evidence in.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.660
Good.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.792
Who was that?

17:56.840 --> 17:57.932
Someone from work.

17:57.970 --> 18:00.302
Am I gonna recognize my kitchen
when you're done, Sara?

18:00.340 --> 18:01.568
I hope not.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.271
That's why we put coffee
filters by the coffee.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.572
Doesn't that make sense?

18:04.610 --> 18:05.804
AUBREY:
Problem is, he
needs a girlfriend.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.818
SARA:
Did you even try to fight
the suspension, Will?

18:07.850 --> 18:08.874
Did you?
Wasn't something you fought.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.411
Where has the beer
been reorganized?

18:11.450 --> 18:12.815
I could have Roger make a call.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.408
Sara, your husband's
a port master.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.859
Will's not trying
to locate a boat.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.551
He knows people,
that's all I'm saying.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.820
And it's better than sitting
around all day, playing guitar.

18:19.860 --> 18:21.725
Maybe you should
get another job.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.899
You guys do know
my firm has $38 million

18:23.930 --> 18:25.568
in yearly assets, right?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.363
Roger could call his friend
at the Bar Association.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.435
He knows people.

18:28.470 --> 18:29.494
You know, I'm fine.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.609
I have money...
Or

18:30.640 --> 18:31.709
maybe he could
refer you to someone

18:31.740 --> 18:32.729
to get another job.

18:32.770 --> 18:33.805
AUBREY:
I just said that.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.206
Why do you always take
what I say and repeat it?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.878
SARA:
It doesn't matter who said
it; it's if it's true.

18:37.910 --> 18:38.877
AUBREY:
Yeah, but I said it.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.913
Okay, I'm gonna go over here

18:41.950 --> 18:44.214
and talk to myself.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.842
Wait, what about a girlfriend?

18:45.890 --> 18:46.914
Why aren't you seeing someone?

18:46.950 --> 18:49.157
He is-- the woman
on the phone.

18:49.190 --> 18:49.884
Who's she?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.251
Some lavwer.

18:51.290 --> 18:52.928
It makes him upset
when we talk about it.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.598
Does it, Will?

18:54.630 --> 18:56.393
Who is she?

18:56.430 --> 18:58.159
How long are
you two staying?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.895
Where's your yearbook?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.490
There were some girls
in high school, remember?

19:02.540 --> 19:04.428
No, he likes younger women.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.869
CROZIER:
Your Honor, not only is this

19:05.910 --> 19:07.377
Facebook page irrelevant,

19:07.410 --> 19:09.571
but it's a bit
of a desecration of poor Kara

19:09.610 --> 19:10.577
to use it in court.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.842
Your Honor,
I think I need your help.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.518
With what, Miss...?

19:16.550 --> 19:17.744
D'Arcy.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.382
I don't understand

19:19.420 --> 19:21.183
how this evidence
pertaining

19:21.220 --> 19:22.881
to the cause of Kara's suicide
can be irrelevant

19:22.920 --> 19:25.559
when that's what the plaintiff
is suing us for.

19:25.590 --> 19:26.682
For being that cause.

19:26.730 --> 19:27.856
But that's not what this is.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.697
This is Kara's
Facebook page,

19:29.730 --> 19:31.288
and to make it seem...

19:31.330 --> 19:32.592
Like her thoughts
just before she died...

19:32.630 --> 19:34.530
No.

19:34.570 --> 19:36.765
That's not what I was saying.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.233
I'm sorry, I interrupted.

19:38.270 --> 19:41.808
Yes, you did, I'm...
IfI could continue...

19:41.840 --> 19:42.875
It's a desecration.

19:42.910 --> 19:43.945
Yes, you said that.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.444
Nicely done.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.809
You take_the
questioning.

19:51.850 --> 19:54.318
She doesn't like me,
does she?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.884
Not one bit.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.327
MAN:
We started going out
two years ago.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.769
And you were her tutor
before that?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.291
Yes, and after that,
every Tuesday and Thursday.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.967
Now, you claimed
in your testimony,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.639
um, that...

20:11.670 --> 20:13.570
Um...

20:13.610 --> 20:15.430
One second.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.238
Go right for the YouTube.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.469
Sorry about that, Your Honor.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.612
My first time in court.

20:23.650 --> 20:24.617
Objection.

20:24.650 --> 20:27.687
Your Honor, do we really
need the personal touch?

20:27.720 --> 20:28.948
No, you're right, sustained.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.252
Sorry about that.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.325
Just nervous.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.782
You're doing fine.
Thank you.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.957
Now, Derek,
you claimed

20:35.000 --> 20:37.321
that _Kara didn't
conSIder SUIClde

20:37.370 --> 20:39.964
until after she saw my
client's YouTube preview

20:40.000 --> 20:41.490
of the suicide.
Yeah, that's right.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.632
It was right
around then.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.807
Good.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.001
Do you recognize this?

20:46.040 --> 20:48.702
Yes, that's Kara's
Facebook page.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.968
Could you read
the quote she posted?

20:50.010 --> 20:52.672
"Down in the graveyard,
they're all quiet,

20:52.710 --> 20:54.610
and the women have got
to hold their tongues."

20:54.650 --> 20:55.719
Right.

20:55.750 --> 20:56.819
What's that from?

20:56.850 --> 20:58.010
Ethan Frome.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.041
Which is a novel
about hopeless lovers

21:00.090 --> 21:02.308
who resort to suicide?

21:02.360 --> 21:04.055
Yes.
And she added
this to her Facebook page

21:04.090 --> 21:06.581
six months before she saw
the YouTube video?

21:06.630 --> 21:08.052
Objection.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.297
Your Honor, is Miss D'Arcy
really trying to blame a novel?

21:11.330 --> 21:13.025
Seems to make about as much
sense as blaming a Video.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.561
Well, I see both your points.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.967
But I'm going to have
to overrule that objection.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.706
And five months before
seeing the YouTube Video,

21:21.740 --> 21:24.004
what did she write on
her Facebook page there?

21:24.050 --> 21:27.577
"For her life, which will be
so much happier without me."

21:27.620 --> 21:29.474
And that's from Kurt Cobain's
suicide note, isn't it?

21:29.520 --> 21:30.509
DEREK:
Yes.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.619
CAITLIN:
And, finally--

21:31.650 --> 21:34.858
this is three months before
seeing the YouTube video--

21:34.890 --> 21:36.312
could you read that?

21:39.490 --> 21:40.889
I understand.

21:40.930 --> 21:42.750
I'll read it.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.496
"Every time
you leave me,

21:45.530 --> 21:48.431
you push me closer to the edge."

21:48.470 --> 21:50.335
And that's under a photo
of you, isn't it?

21:50.370 --> 21:52.031
She took it down right
after she wrote it.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.378
Wouldn't you say

21:53.410 --> 21:55.037
that reflected
suicidal tendencies?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.378
No, she talked,
she always talked,

21:57.410 --> 21:59.344
but she didn't really want to do
it until she watched his video.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.371
She played it over and over.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.412
Just as she read Ethan Frome
over and over?
That's not the same thing.

22:04.450 --> 22:05.849
Why isn't it?
One's a book,
and one's a video.

22:05.890 --> 22:07.585
I don't know.
It's just different.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.383
CAITLIN:
Derek, you and Kara
were supposed

22:09.420 --> 22:10.978
to go out the weekend
before she died,

22:11.030 --> 22:13.590
weren't you?
What happened?
What do you mean?

22:13.630 --> 22:15.757
I mean, you didn't go out,
did you? Why?

22:15.800 --> 22:17.597
I was busy. I didn't even speak
to her that weekend.

22:17.630 --> 22:18.995
Because you were actually on

22:19.030 --> 22:20.588
a last-minute skiing trip
with friends, weren't you?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.039
That has nothing
to do with this. Nothing.

22:22.070 --> 22:22.866
She knew I was going.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.629
Really? "Every time
you leave me,

22:24.670 --> 22:25.864
you push me closer
to the edge."

22:25.910 --> 22:27.400
I did not cause this.

22:27.440 --> 22:30.079
Thank you.
No further questions.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.371
Wow, that was
amazing, Caitlin.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.739
Thank you,
Ms. Lockhart.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.746
We'll have to talk.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.592
ELI:
Then be clean. I'm not telling
you how to run your office.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.166
You are telling me how
to run my office

22:54.200 --> 22:55.736
if you're telling me to
hire someone that's inadequate.

22:55.770 --> 22:56.737
He's not inadequate.

22:56.770 --> 22:58.829
Horton Baker is _one of the best
lawyers in town.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.739
I told you that I wasn't
hiring any friends.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.407
Do you see
how crazy this is?

23:04.450 --> 23:06.406
Your friends get penalized,
your enemies get promotions.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.145
Eli, we have to make
a separation between what

23:08.180 --> 23:10.683
you do and what I do.
I have to run this office.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.039
You have
to get me elected.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.114
And I can't do that, Peter.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.519
That's why I'm coming to you.
I can't do it.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.451
You're not getting
the keynote.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.422
Why? I thought that was
a good meeting.

23:24.470 --> 23:25.391
It was a good meeting.

23:25.430 --> 23:27.967
Donna Brazile likes you,
but your friends...

23:30.240 --> 23:32.162
...are speaking ill of you.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.577
There's still a chance

23:36.610 --> 23:38.749
of a convention spot
earlier in the week.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.216
Prime time?

23:44.250 --> 23:45.683
(groans)
Maybe.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.711
You need friends, Peter.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.479
You need people to call up
on your behalf.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.828
It's not unclean
to offer patronage.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.122
It's the way
things are done.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.458
It's the way things
have always been done.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.162
I get it.
Thanks, Eli.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.502
Peter, if you're not taking
the governorship seriously,

24:05.540 --> 24:07.531
I need time to plan my future.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.049
How much time?

24:15.550 --> 24:17.916
All 911 calls are erased.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.918
After 30 days.
Yes, I know that.

24:19.950 --> 24:21.759
But your office is
prosecuting a robbery

24:21.790 --> 24:23.189
that happened
that same night.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.529
So the tape
was preserved.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.152
So send a subpoena.
You know the drill.

24:27.190 --> 24:29.499
You'll have it in a few weeks.

24:29.530 --> 24:31.088
I need it today.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.825
Cary?

24:32.870 --> 24:34.633
Cary, Cary, the tape?

24:34.670 --> 24:36.035
I'll look into it.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.934
*

25:20.010 --> 25:22.877
I think I see a man
on Glenhurst Bridge

25:22.920 --> 25:25.184
and he's about to jump.
Please hurry.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.251
ALICIA:
It took them 42 minutes to send

25:28.290 --> 25:29.882
a patrol car?

25:29.920 --> 25:32.081
And I discovered that
it takes the police

25:32.130 --> 25:35.588
48 minutes, on average,
to respond to a call.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.963
And the suicide hotline phones
on the bridge are out of order.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.968
We can implead the City.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.592
Make them our codefendants.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.961
And give them an incentive
to move faster on the 911 call.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.568
Good work.
Thanks.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.339
One more thing.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.601
I've been reassigned
your tax case.

25:52.650 --> 25:54.572
The one Will
was handling?

25:54.620 --> 25:55.678
The IRS is claiming

25:55.720 --> 25:57.585
that the businesses you reported

25:57.620 --> 26:00.248
receiving income from
don't exist.

26:00.290 --> 26:01.257
Well, they're wrong.

26:01.290 --> 26:02.609
You have proof?

26:02.660 --> 26:03.888
Yeah, what's up?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.080
Oh, I just had a question.

26:06.130 --> 26:07.654
Okay.
I can get proof.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.826
Okay, thanks.

26:12.870 --> 26:16.362
I've been looking over my
priorities for the year, David,

26:16.400 --> 26:21.269
and I wanted to thank you for
setting up my children's trusts,

26:21.310 --> 26:25.041
but I won't need any more help.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.948
You're dismissing me?

26:31.990 --> 26:34.356
No.
I've decided not to divorce.

26:34.390 --> 26:35.755
Really?

26:35.790 --> 26:37.212
It's a bad time.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.820
Well, I can wait
till it's a good time.

26:39.860 --> 26:43.057
No, thank you.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.762
I've decided to go another way.

26:47.670 --> 26:49.831
Sure. Why not?

26:49.870 --> 26:51.758
Whatever you want.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.402
The customer's always right,
huh?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.203
Thank you, David,
for all your hard...

26:55.240 --> 26:57.379
Alicia, look at me.

26:57.410 --> 26:59.378
I don't give a damn.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.225
Will is gone,

27:15.260 --> 27:17.194
and Diane is alone
at the top.

27:17.230 --> 27:18.424
And that's bad?

27:18.470 --> 27:20.324
That's an imbalance.

27:20.370 --> 27:22.292
This firm needs two at the top.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.364
Why?

27:23.400 --> 27:26.005
Because Diane is an ideologue.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.179
She pursues cases
that cost us money

27:28.210 --> 27:31.043
because they are "right,"
not because they're worthy.

27:35.050 --> 27:38.349
So, you're looking to me

27:38.390 --> 27:41.154
to support you in a vote
to replace Will?

27:41.190 --> 27:44.182
Yes. And in turn,
I will support you.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.379
In what?

27:45.430 --> 27:46.328
In any way you want.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.851
You and David Lee don't like
each other.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.869
I don't think that has anything
to do with this.

27:51.900 --> 27:57.293
Sure, you get enough votes
together,

27:57.340 --> 27:58.807
I'll support you.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.206
Good.
Thank you, Eli.

28:06.110 --> 28:09.113
Let's just keep this
between you and I, okay?

28:09.150 --> 28:10.742
Sure.

28:16.220 --> 28:19.383
Keep me in touch
on this, Julius.

28:24.530 --> 28:26.418
You want a magazine
or something?

28:30.200 --> 28:32.236
Who was that lacrosse player
you dated senior year?

28:32.270 --> 28:33.305
Jane something.

28:33.340 --> 28:35.308
Jane Trout?
Why?

28:35.340 --> 28:37.945
Just seeing what Jane Trout is
up to these days.

28:37.980 --> 28:40.039
Are you trying to find all
of my exes online?

28:40.080 --> 28:41.968
Oh, look, she still lives
in Chicago.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.749
Didn't you give her
your class ring?

28:43.790 --> 28:44.609
I didn't give her
my class ring.

28:44.650 --> 28:46.789
She stole it.
She was a kleptomaniac.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.458
Why don't we look up
someone for you, Aubrey?

28:48.490 --> 28:50.754
Because
I'm a committed Buddhist.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.223
You are not.
You're making things up.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.524
And since when have Buddhists
been unable to date?

28:54.560 --> 28:56.790
See how he did that?

28:56.830 --> 28:59.390
He changed
the conversation to me?
She's right.

28:59.430 --> 29:00.761
How's your job going, Sara?

29:00.800 --> 29:02.438
Oh, no, no.
Here's the thing.

29:02.470 --> 29:05.769
I'm taking a break:
from the law, from dating,

29:05.810 --> 29:07.209
from even thinking about dating.

29:07.240 --> 29:10.949
I like not thinking...
just for a moment.

29:12.850 --> 29:14.044
She's cute.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.274
Go for it.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.548
I promise not to tell
your husband.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.945
Ha.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.788
So who was this woman
on the phone?

29:20.820 --> 29:22.219
No idea.

29:22.260 --> 29:26.128
Someone on the suicide case.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.195
Yes, sir?

29:29.230 --> 29:34.099
Yeah, uh, so we need to make
room for a new ASA.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.529
I didn't know
we were hiring.

29:36.570 --> 29:37.559
We weren't,

29:37.600 --> 29:39.500
but now we are.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.269
We need some new blood
in this place.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.403
I'll put out some feelers.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.249
No, no, no.
I've already hired someone.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.770
Horton Baker.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.548
I see.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.549
You see?

29:52.590 --> 29:55.559
I see you needed
to hire someone.

29:55.590 --> 29:58.150
Yeah.

29:58.190 --> 29:59.987
What department?

30:00.030 --> 30:02.498
Head of felony review.

30:06.030 --> 30:09.238
And, sir, do you want any
consultation on any of this?

30:09.270 --> 30:11.500
No, I don't want
any consultation.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.428
I just want you to do it.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.279
Okay.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.870
ASA Pine is the current head
of felony review.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.342
I'll have to move her out.

30:22.380 --> 30:24.587
Move her out.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.459
I'm on it.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.857
CROZIER:
Your Honor, the defense is

30:35.900 --> 30:37.219
just trying
to shift blame.

30:37.260 --> 30:38.989
Yes, to the guilty party.

30:39.030 --> 30:41.169
It was the City's negligence
that was responsible.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.292
All we ask is

30:42.340 --> 30:45.059
that they be made
a third-party defendant
in our suit.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.634
Because
of a broken hotline phone?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.979
And their delayed
911 response time.

30:49.010 --> 30:49.977
Here are the timelines

30:50.010 --> 30:51.546
from_ five
separate inCIdents.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.605
ALICIA:
The City has also refused to put
barriers on the bridge.

30:53.650 --> 30:55.641
They've prioritized aesthetics
over saving lives.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.341
This is just
a bald attempt

30:57.380 --> 30:59.917
to force the City to hand over
a tape of Aidan's 911 call.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.918
We are just trying
to help Ms. Crozier

31:01.960 --> 31:03.450
and her clients punish
the true culprits here.

31:03.490 --> 31:06.220
Thank you. I think we're doing
just fine on our own.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.928
It really takes them 48 minutes?

31:12.330 --> 31:13.490
She's shown tremendous promise,

31:13.530 --> 31:15.088
and you've been
an exceptional mentor.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.892
Thank you.
That's why I want you

31:16.940 --> 31:18.305
to be the first to know

31:18.340 --> 31:20.137
I have decided to make
Caitlin a full litigator.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.900
I know it's fast.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.943
But with Will gone, we need
everybody to step up.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.049
I understand.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.217
But you disagree?

31:28.250 --> 31:31.344
I think Caitlin is good.
She's very quick.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.609
I think she needs
some time to get comfortable.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.013
I threw you in over your head

31:36.060 --> 31:37.584
and you didn't take long
to get comfortable.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.383
That's true.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.022
Good. Then can I ask you
a favor?

31:41.060 --> 31:42.925
Would you mind sharing
your assistant?

31:42.960 --> 31:45.394
Just until we get one?

31:47.170 --> 31:48.990
Sure.
Great.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.359
It's just for
a few weeks.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.937
And it'll give you a chance
to help supervise her.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.131
Mm-hmm.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.499
Thanks.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.584
Hello there.

32:07.620 --> 32:10.589
And, David.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.054
What do you need?

32:13.090 --> 32:15.650
I have never shown an interest
in management.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.292
No, you haven't.

32:17.330 --> 32:19.366
I like doing. I don't like...

32:19.400 --> 32:21.197
helping others do.

32:21.240 --> 32:26.007
But I'm stepping up because
I think there are people

32:26.040 --> 32:29.134
who have an eye
on Will's office.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.603
They pretend to have
the firm's interests
at heart,

32:31.650 --> 32:32.844
but what they
really want

32:32.880 --> 32:37.613
is their name on the letterhead
and an equal vote With you.

32:37.650 --> 32:39.481
And you're stepping up for...?

32:39.520 --> 32:40.612
Taking Will's place.

32:40.650 --> 32:43.585
(chuckles)

32:43.620 --> 32:46.157
No, David.
You would hate it.

32:46.190 --> 32:47.589
You hate people.

32:47.630 --> 32:48.619
I don't hate people.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.128
I hate... some people.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.592
I am being selfless here.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.391
Well, um, let me consider it.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.032
Here's the thing.

32:59.070 --> 33:01.709
When Will comes back,
you know I'll give up the seat.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.139
I don't want the seat.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.171
So you know I'll give it up.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.144
Thank you, David.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.157
I hear the 911 tape
miraculously surfaced.

33:20.190 --> 33:21.748
I told you I would
look into it.
Yeah.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.722
I just thought you
needed a little... nudge.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.398
Next time, don't drag
the City into your mess.

33:25.430 --> 33:27.990
You're in a bad mood.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.467
Iam.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.277
So you'll drop the
request to implead?

33:41.820 --> 33:43.117
911 OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

33:43.150 --> 33:44.287
AIDAN:
Oh, my God, she's going to jump.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.719
911 OPERATOR:
Who is going to jump?

33:45.750 --> 33:47.240
AIDAN:
There's a girl on
the Glenhurst Bridge.

33:47.290 --> 33:48.757
She climbed over the railing.
I can't get to her.

33:48.790 --> 33:50.451
911 OPERATOR:
We're dispatching
an officer now.

33:50.490 --> 33:51.559
AIDAN:
Please hurry!

33:51.590 --> 33:54.297
Your Honor, this tape
has not been authenticated.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.218
We obtained it directly from
the state's attorney's office.

33:56.260 --> 33:59.058
Overruled.
Your Honor, we ask
for a short recess.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.522
SERENA:
Granted.

34:01.570 --> 34:04.334
She's scrambling.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.230
You screw up a grand jury
investigation,

34:09.280 --> 34:10.702
and I'm the one
getting the demotion?

34:10.740 --> 34:13.174
It's... it's not a demotion.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.643
I'm being moved
out of felony review.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.079
That's a demotion.

34:16.120 --> 34:20.113
To-to free you up
more for court.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.287
Did your girlfriend
put you up to this?

34:24.330 --> 34:28.289
ASA Lodge is not my girlfriend,
and this is my decision.

34:28.330 --> 34:31.527
Good thing you're not
the final word around here.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.094
Deputy.

34:36.470 --> 34:38.358
Lockhart-Gold.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.332
Sounds almost regal, doesn't it?

34:40.370 --> 34:41.701
(chuckles)

34:41.740 --> 34:43.378
Let me just save you
the energy

34:43.410 --> 34:45.674
and repeat what I've already
told theI others...

34:45.710 --> 34:47.701
am not Ellie others.
i.

34:47.750 --> 34:51.288
You only just became an equity
partner a few months ago.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.618
And Obama was only
a U.S. senator for two years

34:53.650 --> 34:56.357
before he announced
his candidacy.
Eli...

34:56.390 --> 34:58.153
You're going to be running
the governor's campaign.

34:58.190 --> 35:00.181
I don't know if I am.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.460
Things are in flux.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.628
Well, I'm holding
the spot for Will.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.365
We can outvote you.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.628
We?

35:13.670 --> 35:17.299
Me and my...
fostered relationships.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.672
So you're no longer the last kid
picked for the mutiny.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.712
Congratulations.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.781
It's your choice, Diane.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.618
Either you decide, or...

35:27.650 --> 35:30.653
you let the others
decide for you.

35:35.530 --> 35:36.519
(doorbell rings)

35:38.330 --> 35:39.297
Hi there.

35:39.330 --> 35:40.922
Hi. Uh...

35:40.970 --> 35:42.335
I'm looking for Will?

35:42.370 --> 35:43.735
He's in the shower.

35:43.770 --> 35:46.261
I'm his sister_Sara.
Come on in.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.301
Oh. Hi.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.608
And this is
his younger sister Aubrey.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.799
Hi.
Hello.

35:53.850 --> 35:54.874
Uh, I'm Kalinda.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.376
Oh, what a sweet name.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.910
Thank you.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.144
SARA:
So, it's odd.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.556
William has this whole_ other
life we never get to glimpse.

36:01.590 --> 36:02.659
Do you work with him?

36:02.690 --> 36:04.453
I do.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.481
On this case he's on?
The swelde case?

36:06.530 --> 36:08.498
Yeah.

36:08.530 --> 36:10.691
Sit down. Here. We don't bite.

36:10.730 --> 36:12.425
Not hard, anyway.

36:15.470 --> 36:17.438
Can I get you anything
to drink, Kalinda?

36:17.470 --> 36:19.665
A beer, maybe
some wine?

36:19.710 --> 36:20.734
Are you on the
clock right now?

36:20.770 --> 36:21.976
Kalinda. Hi.

36:22.010 --> 36:23.079
William.

36:23.110 --> 36:25.977
We were just getting
better acquainted with Kalinda.

36:26.010 --> 36:26.977
Mm-hmm.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.819
She says you're not dating.

36:28.850 --> 36:31.284
Oh. Dear God.
Do you have a moment, Will?

36:31.320 --> 36:33.584
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys probably
want to talk in private.

36:33.620 --> 36:35.986
Just ignore them.

36:36.020 --> 36:37.783
Nice meeting you.

36:43.830 --> 36:46.321
So. Family, huh?

36:46.370 --> 36:48.497
Yeah. What's going on?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.292
You need to get back to work.

36:50.340 --> 36:53.229
I'm suspended, Kalinda.
There's a lot of movement.

36:53.270 --> 36:55.500
Yeah. David Lee and Julius.
I figured.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.599
Eli, too.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.002
They want to fill the vacuum.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.439
Just... just show your face.
No.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.017
Thanks, but... I need
to make a go of this.

37:05.050 --> 37:07.314
Everything good
with Alicia's case?
Yeah.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.683
You, uh...
you gave her my case, too?

37:12.730 --> 37:14.493
Will... if this
is your way

37:14.530 --> 37:16.293
of trying to make things
better between us...

37:16.330 --> 37:17.149
No.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.599
It's my way of trying
to save your ass.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.337
Your, uh, sisters
seem interesting.

37:25.370 --> 37:26.462
Yep.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.034
Could you get them arrested?

37:28.070 --> 37:30.038
Ms. Norris.

37:30.080 --> 37:33.402
When you worked on this film,
were there rules for the crew

37:33.450 --> 37:35.418
as to how _to handle
potential jumpers?

37:35.450 --> 37:37.372
Yes. The rules were
carefully spelled out.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.047
If someone stepped over
the railing onto the ledge,

37:39.090 --> 37:40.819
we were to call 911.
I see.

37:40.850 --> 37:44.388
So if someone was
standing on the bridge

37:44.430 --> 37:48.491
for say, 40 minutes, looking
down at the water, crying,

37:48.530 --> 37:50.498
that wouldn't trigger
a 911 call?

37:50.530 --> 37:52.066
No. Just someone
over the railing.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.591
CROZIER:
The defense has admitted
evidence that it takes,

37:54.640 --> 37:57.393
on average, 48 minutes
for the police to respond

37:57.440 --> 37:58.532
to a potential jumper.

37:58.570 --> 38:02.404
If you wait until
someone is on the ledge,

38:02.440 --> 38:04.874
how many lives
did you actually save?

38:08.920 --> 38:10.569
No one.

38:16.090 --> 38:17.557
It was nice to hear
from you again so soon, Donna.

38:17.590 --> 38:19.785
I've been told
by your friends

38:19.830 --> 38:21.593
you are someone worth
getting to know better.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.097
They've been filling up
my phone sheet all week.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.859
I hope they haven't been
too aggressive.

38:24.900 --> 38:26.424
There's nothing wrong
with aggressive.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.688
Long as they don't
start showing up at my house.

38:28.740 --> 38:29.798
(laughs)

38:29.840 --> 38:32.468
Well, I'm an open book.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.807
What would you like to know?

38:33.840 --> 38:36.707
Forgive me for being blunt...

38:36.740 --> 38:39.072
but are you and your wife
still living apart?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.842
We are.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.939
For the moment.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.912
But we're committed
to making our marriage work.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.351
I'm glad to hear that.

38:52.390 --> 38:55.450
It would be my pleasure
to meet her someday.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.855
ELI:
Maybe someday
in September?

38:57.900 --> 39:00.528
In Charlotte?

39:00.570 --> 39:03.733
I already said she knew
I was going on a ski trip.

39:03.770 --> 39:04.907
Yeah, but you also said

39:04.940 --> 39:06.567
that you didn't speak
with her that weekend.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.531
And we have phone records

39:07.570 --> 39:11.506
to show that you spoke
with her for 37 minutes.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.949
You argued, didn't you?

39:12.980 --> 39:14.516
No. Stop blaming
me for this.

39:14.550 --> 39:16.745
You lied
on the stand, Derek.

39:16.780 --> 39:18.145
What did you argue about?

39:18.180 --> 39:19.147
We didn't argue.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.680
All right. Then you talked.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.857
What did you talk about?

39:23.860 --> 39:25.851
She said she wasn't coming
back to school next year.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.482
Because of you?
No.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.998
It wasn't her choice.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.567
Look, I'm sorry I lied.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.989
I just didn't want anyone
to think I was responsible.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.031
Then who is responsible?

39:39.470 --> 39:40.937
I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson.

39:40.970 --> 39:42.073
I know this is
difficult for you.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.577
I just have one question.

39:43.610 --> 39:44.577
All right.

39:44.610 --> 39:46.077
When did you inform your
daughter that you would

39:46.110 --> 39:47.907
no longer be paying
her college tuition?

39:47.950 --> 39:48.848
CROZIER:
Objection, Your Honor.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.017
Relevance?

39:50.050 --> 39:51.847
Any financial hardship
or pressure placed

39:51.890 --> 39:54.518
_ on the victim _
is relevant to a lawswt

39:54.560 --> 39:56.915
about what motivated her
to commit suicide.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.884
Please answer
the question, Mr. Anderson.

40:01.500 --> 40:06.597
We had an agreement that she had
to maintain at least a 3.8 GPA.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.689
But she failed
her final exams.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.866
I understand.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.992
But my question was:

40:11.040 --> 40:15.079
When did you tell her you were
no longer supporting her?

40:17.910 --> 40:20.606
Two days before she died.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.076
Thank you.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.011
We'll give you a disclaimer
at the beginning of the movie.

40:30.060 --> 40:31.482
CROZIER:
Your client can still
be held liable.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.929
It doesn't matter who else
you try and blame.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.951
It does to a jury.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.664
A disclaimer, plus a donation
of half the film's profits

40:39.700 --> 40:41.065
to a suicide awareness campaign.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.068
So how does Mexican
sound for dinner?

40:48.110 --> 40:52.649
Should we make a reservation
for three or four?

40:52.680 --> 40:53.647
P.M.?

40:53.680 --> 40:55.113
No, people.

40:55.150 --> 40:59.109
My math's a little rusty, but...

41:00.920 --> 41:04.083
Oh, no, no. Come on.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.656
We want to get to know
Kalinda better.

41:05.690 --> 41:06.987
I like her.

41:07.030 --> 41:08.179
And I don't like
any of your girlfriends.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.891
I am not dating Kalinda.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.921
I am not dating anyone.
You're pining for her.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.619
I can see...
You work together.

41:13.670 --> 41:15.729
It's natural. _
You need someone speCIal
in your life, Will.

41:15.770 --> 41:16.930
You need organization.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.039
You're not getting any younger.

41:18.070 --> 41:19.901
Women think it's cute now.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.168
In another five years...

41:21.210 --> 41:25.078
Roger did so much
for my life.

41:25.110 --> 41:27.499
You think you don't
need a spouse.

41:27.550 --> 41:28.517
Especially now.

41:28.550 --> 41:29.972
You're out of work.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.885
You need someone.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.979
(elevator bell dings)

41:40.090 --> 41:41.648
DIANE:
You lasted a full week.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.123
I'm impressed.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.024
Could have lasted longer.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.026
You have my sisters
to thank for that.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.264
I'll send flowers.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.734
You know I can't
practice law.

41:51.770 --> 41:55.979
I know. But you can offer
updates on your ongoing cases.

41:58.010 --> 41:59.773
Did we fire Caitlin?
No.

41:59.810 --> 42:01.949
We promoted her.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.117
Anything else
I should know about?

42:07.150 --> 42:11.189
Just that I can't promise
that everyone will be

42:11.220 --> 42:13.051
quite so pleased
to see you back.
