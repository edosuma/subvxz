WEBVTT

00:09.899 --> 00:12.332
- Oh, God.
- Yes, it's my birthday.

00:12.334 --> 00:14.735
But don't worry.
I've taken care of everything.

00:14.737 --> 00:16.637
I got my cupcake, I sang to myself,

00:16.639 --> 00:18.239
and I opened the card from
Grandma with the $2 bill in it.

00:18.241 --> 00:19.539
I'm good.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.908
Okay, look, first of all,
we did not forget your birthday.

00:21.910 --> 00:23.531
- We were just...
- Don't even try.

00:24.513 --> 00:27.247
Look, I don't care about any
of the birthday accoutrements.

00:27.249 --> 00:31.117
I just got it out of the way,
so we could concentrate on this.

00:31.119 --> 00:33.186
I thought you had to be 15
to get a learner's permit.

00:33.188 --> 00:35.488
I am 15, and you signed
the permit last week.

00:35.490 --> 00:37.290
That's what that was?

00:37.292 --> 00:39.659
I thought you were gonna
learn how pizza gets made.

00:39.661 --> 00:42.361
Look, I've read all the manuals.

00:42.363 --> 00:43.930
I've got a phone book on the front seat,

00:43.932 --> 00:45.398
which, coincidentally, I've also read.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.666
I'm ready to go.

00:46.668 --> 00:48.601
Now, I know you both want to
share this iconic moment

00:48.603 --> 00:49.702
with your son,

00:49.704 --> 00:51.104
so I'm gonna leave you two
to fight it out,

00:51.106 --> 00:52.305
and I'll meet the winner in the car.

00:57.278 --> 01:01.046
Okay, now, before we start,
it is important to remember...

01:04.985 --> 01:06.185
You're up.

01:06.187 --> 01:08.687
Wow, that was fast.

01:08.689 --> 01:09.721
Anything I should know?

01:10.555 --> 01:11.523
The Lord's Prayer.

01:14.962 --> 01:16.377
Frankie, wait.

01:17.295 --> 01:18.763
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:22.937 --> 01:24.803
Well, I don't know
what went wrong with your dad,

01:24.805 --> 01:26.237
but that's not gonna happen with me

01:26.239 --> 01:28.373
because I am much more laid-ba... Aah!

01:31.378 --> 01:33.845
It was 12 hours ago,
and I'm still sweating.

01:33.847 --> 01:36.180
It's like a high-speed heart attack.

01:36.182 --> 01:38.316
Okay, people, I need your help.

01:38.318 --> 01:40.552
This is serious. All hands on deck.

01:40.554 --> 01:42.820
Sue, you can't just burst in here.

01:42.822 --> 01:44.388
We could have been...

01:44.390 --> 01:45.890
watching TV.

01:45.892 --> 01:47.925
I need to declare a major by Tuesday.

01:47.927 --> 01:49.593
I know I said I was all-in on theater,

01:49.595 --> 01:51.462
but I'm starting to have
second thoughts...

01:51.464 --> 01:53.731
and third thoughts and a few fourths.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.299
Well, the good news
is you have lots of...

01:55.301 --> 01:56.414
I'm thinking German.

01:56.439 --> 01:58.168
German? Where'd that come from?

01:58.170 --> 02:00.337
Well, I'm taking a German class
this semester.

02:00.339 --> 02:03.240
My professor said
I have a real ear for it.

02:09.882 --> 02:11.782
Wow, Sue, I didn't know you could...

02:11.784 --> 02:13.384
But I still love acting,

02:13.386 --> 02:16.319
and so I'm considering a double
major of theater and German.

02:16.321 --> 02:17.620
Oh, I don't know. That could be...

02:17.622 --> 02:19.155
But I really love horses,

02:19.157 --> 02:21.992
so veterinary medicine is still
right there in the running.

02:21.994 --> 02:24.027
You've been running
with veterinary medicine?

02:24.029 --> 02:25.595
What happened to archeology?

02:25.597 --> 02:27.864
That was two majors ago. Keep up.

02:27.866 --> 02:28.899
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

02:28.901 --> 02:30.466
I haven't ruled out archeology yet,

02:30.468 --> 02:31.834
so here's what I'm thinking.

02:31.836 --> 02:33.969
A triple major with one minor.

02:33.971 --> 02:36.272
Or better yet... a quadruple major.

02:36.274 --> 02:38.508
My adviser says no one
has ever quadruple majored,

02:38.510 --> 02:42.278
<i>but</i> no one had landed on
the moon before someone did it.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.979
Astronomy!

02:46.751 --> 02:49.651
Mom? Dad?

02:53.791 --> 02:55.724
Anybody here to take me driving?

02:59.863 --> 03:01.496
Hello?

03:05.469 --> 03:06.635
Where are you guys?

03:10.340 --> 03:11.434
Hm.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.988 --> 03:28.756
Watch your head, dude. Whoo!

03:28.758 --> 03:32.160
All right. Laundry done.

03:32.162 --> 03:33.261
So, how's it going?

03:33.263 --> 03:35.163
That one of Mom's nightstand cookies?

03:35.165 --> 03:36.431
I want to practice my driving,

03:36.433 --> 03:37.765
but Mom and Dad are never around.

03:37.767 --> 03:38.866
Driving?

03:38.868 --> 03:40.200
Got to be 15 to get your permit.

03:40.202 --> 03:41.502
I am 15.

03:43.038 --> 03:44.137
Thought you were 12.

03:45.508 --> 03:48.609
Are you sure about this?
I'm about to drive your house.

03:48.611 --> 03:51.411
Hey, if you can handle the
'Bago, you can handle anything.

03:51.413 --> 03:53.046
It's like my theory on math.

03:53.048 --> 03:55.248
If you start with calculus,
then the rest of it...

03:55.250 --> 03:57.484
like adding and subtracting...
will come easy.

03:57.486 --> 03:59.252
I didn't know that you knew calculus.

03:59.254 --> 04:01.588
I don't 'cause
they didn't start with it.

04:01.590 --> 04:02.504
All right,

04:02.529 --> 04:04.091
we'll just strap in and then...

04:04.093 --> 04:06.393
Whoa!

04:06.395 --> 04:07.627
Easy there, Earnhardt.

04:07.629 --> 04:09.829
I got some meatballs cooking
back there in a Crock-Pot.

04:12.133 --> 04:14.601
Um, where's the turn signal on this?

04:14.603 --> 04:16.503
Who cares?
That's the beauty of the 'Bago.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.170
People just get out of your way.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.274
Mike, the dryer's
doing that thing again!

04:22.276 --> 04:24.110
Come in here and I'll show you!

04:27.015 --> 04:28.481
- Come here.
- What?

04:28.483 --> 04:31.583
Okay, I just brought you in here
to get out of earshot.

04:31.585 --> 04:33.352
Oh, so the dryer's not really broken?

04:33.354 --> 04:34.586
Oh, it's definitely broken.

04:34.588 --> 04:36.455
- I just didn't want Sue to overhear us.
- Oh.

04:36.457 --> 04:38.957
Should we be concerned about
how much we hide from our kids?

04:38.959 --> 04:40.759
It's just I'm worried about her, Mike.

04:40.761 --> 04:42.661
She's got two days to pick a major,

04:42.663 --> 04:44.496
and she's being so unrealistic.

04:44.498 --> 04:47.465
She is all over the place.
German? Theater?

04:47.467 --> 04:49.434
Where's the future in that?
She's not good.

04:49.436 --> 04:50.736
God, no, she's terrible.

04:50.738 --> 04:51.870
And even the majors

04:51.872 --> 04:53.872
that are a little bit more
practical are a reach.

04:53.874 --> 04:55.206
I mean, veterinary school?

04:55.208 --> 04:57.208
That's harder to get into
than med school.

04:57.210 --> 04:59.310
Remember the time that Doris got her
head stuck in the recycling bin?

04:59.312 --> 05:00.711
Sue panicked.

05:00.713 --> 05:02.447
She ran to the fire department
in her underwear.

05:02.449 --> 05:03.915
Nobody wants a vet like that.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.316
I think we got to talk to her.

05:05.318 --> 05:07.785
I-I mean, I want her to do
something that she loves

05:07.787 --> 05:09.454
but still practical, you know?

05:09.456 --> 05:12.090
When did people decide
they got to like what they do?

05:12.092 --> 05:13.991
- Work is work.
- I know.

05:13.993 --> 05:16.260
There's only four fun jobs
in the world anyway.

05:16.262 --> 05:18.629
Baseball player, football
player, basketball player,

05:18.631 --> 05:19.463
bounty hunter.

05:19.465 --> 05:20.731
Bounty hunter?

05:20.733 --> 05:21.933
Yeah, it's cool.

05:21.935 --> 05:23.568
All right, so, we're agreed.

05:23.570 --> 05:26.170
We can't let her choose
from four insane majors.

05:27.941 --> 05:29.774
I thought I heard keys.

05:29.776 --> 05:31.141
Okay, I'll handle it.

05:31.143 --> 05:32.276
Mm-hmm.

05:47.659 --> 05:50.526
Oh, meatballs are done.

05:50.528 --> 05:51.628
Ha-ha!

05:51.630 --> 05:53.329
Oh!

05:53.331 --> 05:55.398
Oh, and, uh, just keep going straight.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.000
Mm-hmm.

05:57.002 --> 05:58.902
Okay, let's see.

05:58.904 --> 06:00.637
Still straight?

06:00.639 --> 06:02.505
Yeah.

06:02.507 --> 06:04.407
- A-Axl.
- Whoo!

06:04.409 --> 06:05.541
Axl!

06:05.543 --> 06:06.609
Okay.

06:06.611 --> 06:08.344
Whoa, Brick! Brick, stop!

06:08.346 --> 06:09.778
Stop, stop, stop!

06:24.057 --> 06:26.410
I can't sleep.

06:26.497 --> 06:29.331
Every time I shut my eyes,
I see that cow.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.933
Oh,<i> now</i> you see it.

06:31.935 --> 06:33.902
Hey, this is your fault.

06:33.904 --> 06:35.436
You're the one that kept
telling me to go straight.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.906
Yeah, you're right. It is my fault.

06:37.908 --> 06:39.607
I didn't think I had to tell you to stop

06:39.609 --> 06:42.677
when you got to
the giant polyurethane cow.

06:42.679 --> 06:44.646
Neither of us is innocent here, Axl.

06:44.648 --> 06:47.082
There's cow on both our hands.

06:47.084 --> 06:49.450
I can't go on like this.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.186
I think we have to just come
clean and turn ourselves in.

06:52.188 --> 06:53.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.490
Okay, when we have a nerd emergency,

06:55.492 --> 06:57.992
like where to put a bookmark,
we'll be taking your advice.

06:57.994 --> 06:59.994
But everything else, we'll listen to me.

06:59.996 --> 07:01.929
Okay, pranks like this
happen all the time.

07:01.931 --> 07:05.232
We just got to lay low, and
eventually, it'll all blow over.

07:05.234 --> 07:09.336
<i>Unfortunately, Axl wasn't even close.</i>

07:09.338 --> 07:13.073
That cow's been there
for 70 years, Frankie.

07:13.075 --> 07:15.943
70 years. Never seen anything like it.

07:15.945 --> 07:18.712
I'm telling you...
Orson is under attack.

07:18.714 --> 07:21.381
- Wait. What?
- Oh, my God. Didn't you hear?

07:21.383 --> 07:22.982
Somebody targeted the Orson cow,

07:22.984 --> 07:24.685
knocked it right off its pedestal.

07:24.687 --> 07:26.119
They found it just lying on the ground.

07:26.121 --> 07:27.354
- Wow.
- Weird.

07:27.356 --> 07:29.423
I'm telling you,
it's the beginning of the end.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.224
You heard about the trouble
they had in Jasper, right?

07:31.226 --> 07:33.727
Watch out 'cause Orson,
yeah, it could be next.

07:33.729 --> 07:35.253
Next for what?

07:35.278 --> 07:37.263
Exactly, Mike. We don't know.

07:37.265 --> 07:39.632
I mean, this was clearly
a coordinated operation

07:39.634 --> 07:42.368
planned and executed
in the dark of night.

07:42.370 --> 07:43.736
Who would want to attack Orson?

07:43.738 --> 07:46.172
Just last week, I saw a guy
with a dirty backpack

07:46.174 --> 07:48.107
hanging outside the Tastee-Freez, yeah.

07:48.132 --> 07:48.802
Oh.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.277
Now, could be just a guy walking
across America for charity,

07:51.279 --> 07:53.531
or could be a bad element.

07:53.533 --> 07:54.853
We don't know.

07:54.878 --> 07:56.915
Well, the <i> Orson Patch</i>
put their best reporter on it.

07:56.917 --> 07:59.652
Pulled him off the leaf-blower
exposé to go full time on this.

07:59.654 --> 08:00.953
That's 15 hours a week.

08:00.955 --> 08:03.789
I don't know. Cow tipping?

08:03.791 --> 08:06.091
Sounds to me like this
whole thing is just a prank.

08:06.093 --> 08:09.127
An easily forgettable prank.
Kids will be kids.

08:09.129 --> 08:11.163
Let's not encourage them
by giving them press.

08:11.165 --> 08:12.764
I heard Nancy Donahue's organizing

08:12.766 --> 08:14.733
a community task force.

08:14.735 --> 08:17.469
Whoever those vandals are,
they are in trouble now

08:17.471 --> 08:19.471
'cause that woman gets stuff done.

08:19.473 --> 08:21.106
Oh, she's on it all right.

08:21.108 --> 08:23.641
Operation Protect Our Orson
is well under way.

08:23.643 --> 08:25.410
They're gonna bring
these tippers to justice.

08:25.412 --> 08:27.879
You know, the sheriff
was quoted in the <i> Patch</i> saying

08:27.881 --> 08:30.648
he wasn't gonna rest until
somebody's head was on a spike.

08:30.650 --> 08:32.984
All right, I'm gonna go
to the hardware store

08:32.986 --> 08:35.186
to get some padlocks
and an American flag.

08:35.188 --> 08:36.953
Can I get you guys one?

08:36.956 --> 08:38.990
No, we're all set. I got to get to work.

08:38.991 --> 08:40.563
Hey, uh...

08:42.160 --> 08:44.195
be careful out there.

08:51.971 --> 08:53.637
I told you we got to turn ourselves in.

08:53.639 --> 08:54.738
What? Why?

08:54.740 --> 08:55.806
You heard them...

08:55.808 --> 08:57.375
they're putting people's on spikes.

08:57.377 --> 08:58.675
I don't know.

08:58.677 --> 09:00.077
I think my head would look
pretty good on a spike.

09:00.079 --> 09:01.845
Your head doesn't even look good
on your body.

09:01.847 --> 09:03.747
How are you not more worried about this?

09:03.749 --> 09:05.181
'Cause, dude, they got no evidence.

09:05.183 --> 09:06.884
There's nothing that links us
to the crime.

09:07.812 --> 09:09.453
That's not entirely accurate.

09:11.457 --> 09:13.023
Aw, is that the cow horn?

09:13.025 --> 09:15.726
Dude, why did you bring this here?

09:15.728 --> 09:16.927
I didn't mean to.

09:16.929 --> 09:19.362
When we got out of the Winnebago
to check the damage,

09:19.364 --> 09:20.420
I picked it up.

09:20.422 --> 09:22.865
Then realized my fingerprints
were on it, so I just took it.

09:22.867 --> 09:25.635
So you brought home the one
thing that incriminates us.

09:25.637 --> 09:28.238
I panicked, and for good reason.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.073
There's no way
we're getting out of this.

09:30.075 --> 09:31.908
In books, they always catch the culprit.

09:31.910 --> 09:33.276
What books?

09:33.278 --> 09:35.411
How about any Sherlock Holmes novel?

09:35.413 --> 09:36.244
Have you read

09:36.269 --> 09:38.380
- "The Hound of the Baskervilles"?
- No.

09:38.382 --> 09:39.816
- "A Study in Scarlet"?
- No.

09:39.818 --> 09:41.250
- "The Valley of Fear"?
- No!

09:41.252 --> 09:43.052
But I have seen "Captain America."

09:43.054 --> 09:44.219
What happens in that?

09:44.221 --> 09:46.702
I don't know. I kind of lost the plot.

09:47.209 --> 09:49.659
Seriously, Axl, what are going to do?

09:49.661 --> 09:51.693
Just give me a second. I need to think.

09:55.199 --> 09:57.066
What did happen in "Captain America"?

09:59.937 --> 10:01.937
Hey, Sue. You busy?

10:01.939 --> 10:04.173
Just donating $10 to Protect Our Orson.

10:04.175 --> 10:05.874
Oh, and I e-mailed Reverend Timtom,

10:05.876 --> 10:07.609
and he's racing back from Waukesha.

10:07.611 --> 10:09.678
We need his songs now more than ever.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.847
Oh, and I'm thinking of adding
criminal justice

10:11.849 --> 10:13.014
as one of my majors.

10:13.016 --> 10:17.486
Yeah, um, about that.
I've been thinking.

10:17.488 --> 10:19.788
And all those majors sound great,

10:19.790 --> 10:21.690
but four seems like a lot.

10:21.692 --> 10:23.424
Plus, every credit costs money,

10:23.426 --> 10:25.759
so you might want to
narrow it down a little.

10:25.761 --> 10:29.563
Oh. So... just theater then?

10:29.565 --> 10:31.632
That might be a little too narrow.

10:31.634 --> 10:34.535
I mean, what if theater doesn't
turn out to be your thing?

10:34.537 --> 10:37.605
- Ah. German.
- Mm, maybe.

10:37.607 --> 10:39.073
Maybe, although I don't know

10:39.075 --> 10:41.509
if I'd want to put all my eggs
in dat basket.

10:41.511 --> 10:43.911
Fine. Large-animal vet it is.

10:43.913 --> 10:45.579
Okay, Sue, I'm just gonna
break it to you.

10:45.581 --> 10:48.983
There's no inheritance, so you
need a job that pays well.

10:48.985 --> 10:50.384
Vet pays well.

10:50.386 --> 10:51.852
Yeah, but it takes a lot of time.

10:51.854 --> 10:54.722
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you not think I can do it?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.157
Mom, I know
when Doris got her head stuck,

10:57.159 --> 10:59.959
I freaked and ran into
the street in my underwear,

10:59.961 --> 11:02.095
but that is the kind of thing
they teach you to handle

11:02.097 --> 11:03.063
in veterinary school.

11:03.065 --> 11:04.831
I'm not saying that you can't.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.866
I'm saying you have to be practical.

11:06.868 --> 11:09.602
You can't just sign up
for everything that looks fun.

11:09.604 --> 11:12.139
- I...
- You need to, you know, focus.

11:12.141 --> 11:14.507
Right now you seem
a little all over the place.

11:14.509 --> 11:16.308
All over the place?

11:19.414 --> 11:20.914
Okay, look, Sue.

11:20.916 --> 11:23.883
A lot of people sacrificed
so you could go to college.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.217
And you got four years,

11:25.219 --> 11:27.820
so you got to take
those four years seriously.

11:27.822 --> 11:30.289
I am quadruple majoring, Mom.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.823
What is more serious than that?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.225
Okay, look.

11:33.227 --> 11:35.928
Mom, no offense, but you didn't
even graduate from college.

11:35.930 --> 11:38.464
Hey, I may not have graduated
from college,

11:38.466 --> 11:42.000
but that just makes me an expert
in knowing how important it is.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.002
I mean, the only reason
you're still in school

11:44.004 --> 11:45.837
is that your dad
sold his diaper business.

11:45.839 --> 11:46.939
- So, you...
- Wait. What?

11:48.508 --> 11:50.809
Crap.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.945
All right, yep.

11:53.427 --> 11:55.581
When that whole financial-aid
thing got screwed up,

11:55.583 --> 11:58.316
he didn't want you to miss
an entire year of school,

11:58.318 --> 12:01.086
so your dad sold his business.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.155
Hey, I got a question.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.691
Have either of you guys
seen "Captain America"?

12:07.787 --> 12:08.945
What?

12:10.830 --> 12:12.564
All right.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.100
That should be deep enough. Drop it in.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.669
I don't know about this, Axl.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.771
Brick, I am sure
of two things in my life.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.940
One... my head
would look good on anything.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.809
And two... if you want
a problem to go away,

12:24.811 --> 12:26.243
you dig a whole and you bury it.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.211
Really?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.312
Oh, yeah.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.747
If you start digging around this yard,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.215
in five minutes, you'd hit report card.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.194
You gonna hug me again?

12:44.196 --> 12:45.395
No.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.165
I mean, I want to, but I can wait.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.367
I've been thinking a lot
about everything Mom said,

12:50.369 --> 12:52.002
and you guys are right.

12:52.004 --> 12:54.004
I need to just pick one major.

12:54.006 --> 12:57.073
So just tell me what you want me
to do, and I will do it.

12:58.064 --> 13:00.243
What? I'm not gonna do that.

13:00.245 --> 13:02.512
Why not? You told Axl what to major in.

13:02.514 --> 13:05.715
Axl needed to be told to close his
mouth when he takes a shower.

13:05.717 --> 13:07.617
But you gave up everything for me.

13:07.619 --> 13:10.119
I don't want to disappoint you
or make another mistake.

13:10.121 --> 13:13.786
Tell me what you want me to do.
You have to. Please?

13:17.962 --> 13:19.624
Look, you were never supposed to know

13:19.626 --> 13:20.957
what happened with the business.

13:20.959 --> 13:21.864
That was my choice.

13:21.866 --> 13:23.899
And maybe I didn't do you any
favors trying to protect you,

13:23.901 --> 13:26.935
but I just didn't think you
should have to worry about that.

13:28.039 --> 13:30.471
You're asking me what I want for you.

13:31.175 --> 13:32.440
I don't know.

13:32.442 --> 13:34.043
I-I'll tell you
what I don't want for you.

13:34.045 --> 13:35.744
I don't want you to be
on a first-name basis

13:35.746 --> 13:37.245
with the operator from the gas company,

13:37.247 --> 13:38.781
even though Joyce is very nice

13:38.783 --> 13:41.216
and lets us spread the bill
over three credit cards.

13:41.679 --> 13:43.618
I don't want you
to have to share a battery

13:43.620 --> 13:45.220
between both your cars.

13:45.222 --> 13:47.055
I don't want you
to have to hope for a tornado

13:47.057 --> 13:48.356
to bring your next appliance.

13:50.427 --> 13:52.093
I'm not trying to scare you, kid,

13:52.095 --> 13:55.630
but... it's hard sometimes
living like we do.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.901
And, uh...

13:59.635 --> 14:01.758
what I hope for you

14:02.305 --> 14:03.869
is just that it can be different.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.941
Okay.

14:06.943 --> 14:08.275
Okay?

14:08.501 --> 14:09.901
Okay.

14:11.538 --> 14:13.280
Okay.

14:15.784 --> 14:16.950
Okay.

14:27.245 --> 14:31.113
Axl! Brick!
I've been looking for you boys.

14:33.251 --> 14:35.884
I'm not getting enough outreach
to the young people in town.

14:35.886 --> 14:37.786
Can you two pass out some fliers?

14:37.788 --> 14:41.056
Oh-ho, of course. Anything to help.

14:41.058 --> 14:42.523
It's a terrible situation.

14:42.525 --> 14:44.359
I mean, we've been up all night
thinking about it.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.393
That is the truth.

14:45.395 --> 14:47.428
These fliers
have to go to the teen center,

14:47.430 --> 14:49.430
but make sure
they don't go to kids under 10.

14:49.432 --> 14:51.032
I don't want to scare anyone.

14:51.034 --> 14:52.734
Oh.

14:52.736 --> 14:55.002
I see you went with Franklin Gothic,

14:55.004 --> 14:56.371
the most serious of fonts.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.740
So, did you boys hear?

14:58.742 --> 15:00.408
Because of where the cow was hit,

15:00.410 --> 15:02.744
the police have determined
that the perps were driving

15:02.746 --> 15:04.879
a large white or off-white vehicle.

15:04.881 --> 15:06.844
Nancy.

15:07.651 --> 15:09.383
Hey, Paula, just texted me.

15:09.385 --> 15:10.985
There's a car parked at the Panera Bread

15:10.987 --> 15:12.419
with an out-of-state license plate.

15:12.421 --> 15:15.022
Yeah, so, she's gonna send a picture.

15:15.024 --> 15:16.056
Okay.

15:16.058 --> 15:17.691
Okay, you heard him, people!

15:17.693 --> 15:20.394
There's a suspicious vehicle
at the Panera Bread.

15:20.396 --> 15:21.495
Let's move!

15:21.497 --> 15:24.098
And see what the soups are.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.332
Oh, my God.

15:25.334 --> 15:27.434
They've I.D.'d the paint color
of the vehicle now.

15:27.436 --> 15:29.035
Why would you park the 'Bago out front?

15:29.037 --> 15:31.438
Duh, it's called hiding in plain sight.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.507
Don't do anything different
to attract suspicion.

15:33.509 --> 15:36.242
G-Get your nose out of a book
and watch some TV.

15:36.244 --> 15:38.244
I'm telling you, they're gonna
find out it was me.

15:38.246 --> 15:39.446
I mean, who else could it be?

15:39.448 --> 15:41.915
I'm the one who lost
the town slogan contest.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.850
"Orson, the heartland's hidden gem."

15:43.852 --> 15:45.185
It goes right to motive.

15:45.187 --> 15:46.953
Okay, I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

15:46.955 --> 15:49.488
No one's offered up a reward
yet, so we're gonna be the kids

15:49.490 --> 15:51.257
who volunteer
their hard-earned allowance

15:51.259 --> 15:52.591
to help catch the criminals, huh?

15:52.593 --> 15:54.160
We can't afford that.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.695
Oh, my God, Brick,
how can you be so smart

15:55.697 --> 15:56.863
and so dumb at the same time?

15:56.865 --> 15:57.863
It doesn't matter.

15:57.865 --> 15:59.097
No one's gonna collect the reward

15:59.099 --> 16:00.368
'cause we're the ones who did it.

16:01.246 --> 16:03.569
I don't like this, Axl.
I don't like it at all.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.404
We're getting in too deep on this thing.

16:05.406 --> 16:06.706
I think it's too risky.

16:07.150 --> 16:08.140
Wait.

16:08.142 --> 16:09.937
- I think I got it.
- A plan?

16:09.939 --> 16:11.444
No, the plot to "Captain America."

16:11.446 --> 16:14.146
A small bunny cop and a
con-artist fox work together...

16:14.148 --> 16:16.281
Okay, people,

16:16.283 --> 16:18.783
I have been thinking about
everything you've said,

16:18.785 --> 16:21.320
and I know what I want my major to be.

16:21.322 --> 16:23.714
I think it's a good decision.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.524
I am going to major in...

16:27.734 --> 16:30.562
...hospitality and hotel management.

16:33.132 --> 16:35.700
Is that a real thing?
Is that something people can do?

16:35.702 --> 16:36.901
Yeah, I just found it.

16:36.903 --> 16:38.670
I was researching other majors,

16:38.672 --> 16:41.406
and it turns out the school
is known for this program.

16:41.580 --> 16:42.841
Listen to this.

16:42.843 --> 16:46.411
92% of graduates find employment
within six months,

16:46.413 --> 16:47.811
and there's tons of benefits.

16:47.813 --> 16:50.514
I mean, I had never really heard
of this as a major before,

16:50.516 --> 16:52.750
but it makes complete sense for me.

16:52.752 --> 16:55.786
It's people-driven, so I could
use my Dollywood experience.

16:55.788 --> 16:57.621
If I'm working abroad...

16:59.592 --> 17:01.325
And if it's a pet-friendly hotel,

17:01.327 --> 17:02.760
I'll get to be around animals.

17:02.762 --> 17:05.429
Plus, think of
all the binders I would have.

17:05.431 --> 17:06.997
You know how I feel about binders.

17:06.999 --> 17:10.666
Oh, Sue, hotels... that's awesome.

17:10.669 --> 17:13.537
Yeah. Dad, what do you think?

17:14.675 --> 17:16.138
I think we got a winner.

17:16.141 --> 17:18.040
Okay!

17:18.042 --> 17:21.778
Okay. My major is...

17:21.780 --> 17:22.979
...declared.

17:22.981 --> 17:25.281
Ah!

17:25.284 --> 17:27.951
Yay!

17:29.854 --> 17:32.422
Yeah!

17:59.750 --> 18:02.651
That's right. Orson strong.

18:02.653 --> 18:05.487
Thank you, Reverend Timtom.

18:05.489 --> 18:07.355
Now, let's get down to business.

18:07.357 --> 18:10.225
We're here to talk about
this horrific vandalism

18:10.227 --> 18:12.561
that has besmirched our beloved Orson.

18:12.563 --> 18:14.529
They can knock down our cow,

18:14.531 --> 18:16.565
but they can't knock down our spirit!

18:19.303 --> 18:21.369
Now, as an example of Orson pride,

18:21.371 --> 18:23.305
there are two special individuals

18:23.307 --> 18:24.606
I'd like to bring up.

18:24.608 --> 18:29.944
They've offered a reward
from their own money of $500.

18:29.946 --> 18:34.182
Come on up here, Axl and Brick Heck.

18:34.184 --> 18:36.250
- Oh, crap.
- They did it.

18:42.725 --> 18:45.680
Uh, shucks.
We just wanted to do our part.

18:46.529 --> 18:50.385
After all Orson is
the heartland's hidden gem.

18:54.670 --> 18:56.403
You know, as a town,

18:56.405 --> 18:58.371
we're probably gonna have to
accept the fact

18:58.373 --> 19:00.774
that we'll never actually
find out who did this, but...

19:00.776 --> 19:02.175
I know who did it.

19:04.646 --> 19:05.879
Derrick Glossner?

19:05.881 --> 19:07.848
I'm gonna tell you who did it right now.

19:09.618 --> 19:11.099
Donald Wayne Glossner.

19:12.087 --> 19:14.530
Glossners. I knew it.

19:14.956 --> 19:16.856
Yep, he stole the ice-cream truck again

19:16.858 --> 19:18.324
and rammed into the cow.

19:18.326 --> 19:19.925
Why'd you do it, Donald?

19:19.927 --> 19:21.461
None of your damn business.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.963
Okay, then, I want my money.

19:23.965 --> 19:25.498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.866
We can't just hand out money

19:26.868 --> 19:28.601
without a proper investigation, right?

19:28.603 --> 19:30.670
And since when is it legal
to give a reward

19:30.672 --> 19:33.005
to one relative
for turning in their brother?

19:33.007 --> 19:34.606
'Cause if that's a possibility...

19:34.608 --> 19:37.309
I've actually got a great song
for just such an occasion...

19:37.311 --> 19:39.278
about two little scamps
called Cain and Abel.

19:40.948 --> 19:41.981
Not now.

19:41.983 --> 19:42.915
Sheriff.

19:42.917 --> 19:44.349
Well, I don't know.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.752
If says that Donald did
what he's accused of,

19:46.754 --> 19:47.952
then a reward might...

19:47.954 --> 19:50.188
I'm telling you I know he didn't do it.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.390
How do you know that?

19:59.667 --> 20:02.133
Okay, in light of new information,
we're gonna wrap this up.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.368
Thanks for coming, everyone.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.635
Play us out. Play us out.

20:06.106 --> 20:07.505
What's going on?

20:19.485 --> 20:20.818
<i>Yep, in a small town,</i>

20:20.820 --> 20:23.053
<i>things sure can get blown
out of proportion.</i>

20:23.055 --> 20:25.489
<i>But the nice thing about a small town</i>

20:25.491 --> 20:28.793
<i>is folks are also willing
to give you a second chance.</i>

20:28.795 --> 20:30.093
Look, boys.

20:30.095 --> 20:33.297
I reckon all of us make a
mistake at one time or another.

20:33.299 --> 20:37.868
I once put a king snake
in my neighbor's pool.

20:38.242 --> 20:40.737
But we're willing to let this one slide

20:40.739 --> 20:43.172
as long as you two
do a little community service.

20:44.443 --> 20:45.775
And in the spirit of service,

20:45.777 --> 20:47.477
I've taken the liberty of signing you up

20:47.479 --> 20:51.013
for my intensive Laboring
for the Lord good work squad.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.915
And, you...

20:53.201 --> 20:54.951
it's gonna be at least a year

20:54.953 --> 20:57.019
before we let you
get behind the wheel again.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.055
I'm sorry, son.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.645
But that license
is just gonna have to wait.

21:13.304 --> 21:14.603
Every week, huh?

21:14.605 --> 21:16.405
Every week.

21:16.407 --> 21:17.573
A year will go fast.
