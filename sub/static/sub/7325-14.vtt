WEBVTT

00:02.633 --> 00:04.075
(camera shutter clicking)

00:04.075 --> 00:05.176
(Alex) I'M NOT BIG
INTO CHANGE.

00:05.176 --> 00:06.337
(clicking continues)

00:06.337 --> 00:07.508
(Alana) OKAY, GREAT.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.210
UM, NOW LET'S JUST TRY A FEW

00:09.210 --> 00:12.143
WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SMILING.

00:12.143 --> 00:13.284
IN ONCOLOGY,
WHEN A NORMAL CELL

00:13.284 --> 00:14.685
CHANGES INTO
SOMETHING MALIGNANT,

00:14.685 --> 00:16.787
IT'S CALLED
CELLULAR TRANSFORMATION.

00:16.787 --> 00:19.120
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE
THE HOSPITAL MASCOT,

00:19.120 --> 00:20.291
WHATEVER YOU DO--

00:20.291 --> 00:21.452
BRAND AMBASSADOR,

00:21.452 --> 00:23.054
AND YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN APPOINTED YET.

00:23.054 --> 00:24.395
YOU'RE JUST
A VERY STRONG CONTENDER.

00:24.395 --> 00:26.497
HANDSOME, GOOD WITH KIDS...
(clicks keyboard key)

00:26.497 --> 00:27.698
JUST WHAT THE BUYERS WANT.

00:27.698 --> 00:29.200
I'M OUTTA HERE.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.762
THE DAMN CELLS TURN TOXIC
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES.

00:31.762 --> 00:33.334
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED...

00:33.334 --> 00:36.067
LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
SOME PUBLIC RELATIONS REPS

00:36.067 --> 00:37.368
FOLLOWING YOU AROUND TOMORROW.

00:37.368 --> 00:38.639
(door closes)
TRY AND BE CIVIL.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.810
TRANSFORMATION SUCKS.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.412
BRAND AMBASSADOR?
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

00:41.412 --> 00:42.743
YOU GET
TO WEAR A FUNNY HAT

00:42.743 --> 00:44.075
AND CUT THINGS
WITH OVERSIZED SCISSORS?

00:44.075 --> 00:47.348
(mouth full) ALL I KNOW IS,
CAHILL CREEPS ME OUT.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.350
THAT CREEPS ME OUT.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.254
♪♪♪

00:53.254 --> 00:55.256
WHO COMES OVER
TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE

00:55.256 --> 00:56.587
AND STARTS SUCKING FACE?

00:56.587 --> 00:58.129
YOU INVITED 'EM.

00:58.129 --> 00:59.760
(creaking, laughter,
objects crashing)

00:59.760 --> 01:01.162
WHAT'S THAT?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.493
WE ARE DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH
YANG'S ROOM,

01:02.493 --> 01:03.664
AND OWEN'S VISITING.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.096
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
(Cristina laughs)

01:05.096 --> 01:06.397
OH.
(person howls)

01:06.397 --> 01:09.300
IS THAT HIM OR HER?

01:09.300 --> 01:11.172
DO NAPKINS WORK AS EARPLUGS?
(Cristina speaks indistinctly)

01:11.172 --> 01:12.143
(Owen) MM. (laughs)

01:12.143 --> 01:14.645
(imitates wolf howling)

01:14.645 --> 01:17.178
(barking)
(Cristina speaking indistinctly)

01:17.178 --> 01:19.350
OHH.
WHAT THE HELL?

01:19.350 --> 01:21.212
(imitates monkey screeching)

01:21.212 --> 01:22.583
(Cristina moans)

01:22.583 --> 01:23.754
YOU'RE NUTS. (laughs)

01:23.754 --> 01:25.156
(laughs and barks)

01:25.156 --> 01:27.258
(growls)
(Cristina speaking indistinctly)

01:27.258 --> 01:28.759
(roars)

01:28.759 --> 01:30.191
WHAT IS THAT?

01:30.191 --> 01:33.224
I DON'T KNOW.
A GIRAFFE. DINOSAUR.

01:33.224 --> 01:35.166
(growling)
(barking)

01:35.166 --> 01:36.827
(howls)

01:36.827 --> 01:38.769
(imitates monkey)
(continues growling)

01:38.769 --> 01:41.672
(laughs)
(continues growling)

01:41.672 --> 01:43.204
(both laugh)

01:43.204 --> 01:44.175
(howls)

01:44.175 --> 01:45.536
(barks and growls)
(barks)

01:45.536 --> 01:47.338
(Alex) FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME,

01:47.338 --> 01:49.109
JO AND I
ARE NOT INTO EACH OTHER.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.511
OH, PLEASE.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.844
YOU AND PONYTAIL-McGEE WERE
CANINES IN HEAT LAST NIGHT.

01:53.844 --> 01:55.446
(sighs)
LITERALLY.

01:55.446 --> 01:57.148
TOLD YOU THEY WERE
DOING IT, AVERY.

01:57.148 --> 01:58.489
PAY UP.
(scoffs)

01:58.489 --> 01:59.650
I DON'T LIKE HIM
LIKE THAT.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.252
GUYS DON'T JUST HANG OUT
WITH GIRLS.

02:01.252 --> 02:02.423
IT'S NOT IN THEIR D.N.A.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.625
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.297
OKAY, IT'S TRUE.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.229
(Cristina) YOU TWO ARE, LIKE,
ONE DRINK AWAY

02:08.229 --> 02:09.600
FROM CRAZY MONKEY SEX.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.402
JUST STUFF HER TURKEY.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

02:11.402 --> 02:12.603
(Alex) I FEEL FINE.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.235
LOOK, I'M NOT SCREWING
MY EX EVERY NIGHT

02:14.235 --> 02:15.266
AND I'M NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF INTERNS...
(laughs)

02:15.266 --> 02:16.467
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S SOFA.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.908
YOU'RE GONNA PAY TO HAVE
THAT THING DISINFECTED.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.241
NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE.
IT'S A REALLY NICE SOFA, THOUGH.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.412
HEY, APES.

02:21.412 --> 02:22.613
HEY, HERE'S A QUESTION.

02:22.613 --> 02:23.874
UM, WHAT EVER HAPPENED

02:23.874 --> 02:25.716
TO GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
ROMANCE?

02:25.716 --> 02:29.280
NO STUFFING OF TURKEYS
OR DISINFECTING SOFAS,

02:29.280 --> 02:31.782
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHAT ABOUT NICE NORMAL DATES

02:31.782 --> 02:33.324
WHERE PEOPLE TALK,

02:33.324 --> 02:35.256
SHARE A MEAL,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

02:35.256 --> 02:36.787
AND THEN WIND UP TOGETHER,
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE MONKEYS,

02:36.787 --> 02:38.329
BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE
GENUINE FEELINGS

02:38.329 --> 02:39.460
IN A COMMITTED WAY.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.562
I MEAN, WHAT IS SO WRONG
WITH THAT, HUH?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.334
(people speaking indistinctly)

02:43.334 --> 02:46.837
ARE YOU GONNA EAT
ALL OF THOSE?

02:46.837 --> 02:49.940
Y-- UNH--

02:52.343 --> 02:53.804
(Matthew) I LIKE THIS,
SEEING YOU EVERY MORNING.

02:53.804 --> 02:55.906
IT'S, UH, IT'S NICE.

02:55.906 --> 02:57.748
(April) YEAH, IT IS.

02:57.748 --> 02:59.280
IT'S REALLY NICE.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.551
(emergency radio chatter)

03:00.551 --> 03:01.712
I FEEL BAD, THOUGH.

03:01.712 --> 03:03.214
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE

03:03.214 --> 03:04.715
NOW THAT THE E.R.
IS CLOSED.

03:04.715 --> 03:07.388
NICOLE'S JUST STANDING
OUT THERE. (chuckles)

03:07.388 --> 03:08.889
(sighs)
OH.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.691
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR SEAT BACK?

03:10.691 --> 03:11.922
AREN'T YOU COLD?

03:13.364 --> 03:16.267
MY BURRITO
WILL KEEP ME WARM.

03:16.267 --> 03:18.369
(radio chirps)

03:18.369 --> 03:20.231
(chuckles)

03:20.231 --> 03:23.674
(emergency radio chatter
continues)

03:23.674 --> 03:25.276
(exhales)

03:25.276 --> 03:27.207
YOU OKAY?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.380
YOU SEEM A LITTLE OFF.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.582
YEAH.

03:31.582 --> 03:33.284
I WORKED ALL NIGHT.

03:33.284 --> 03:34.415
DO YOU...

03:34.415 --> 03:35.916
DO YOU KNOW HOW BORING
A NIGHT SHIFT IS

03:35.916 --> 03:37.588
WITH NO INCOMING TRAUMAS?

03:37.588 --> 03:39.350
I WAS PRAYING SOMEONE'S
APPENDIX WOULD BURST

03:39.350 --> 03:41.252
JUST TO KEEP ME AWAKE.

03:41.252 --> 03:42.353
(chuckles)

03:42.353 --> 03:43.854
I--HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
TRAIN TO BE A TRAUMA SURGEON

03:43.854 --> 03:45.426
WITH NO E.R.,

03:45.426 --> 03:47.328
NO TRAUMA?

03:49.300 --> 03:50.261
I'M SORRY.

03:50.261 --> 03:52.963
I'M, UH, TIRED
AND I'M VENTING.

03:52.963 --> 03:54.335
(radio beeps)

03:54.335 --> 03:55.436
(man)
Dispatch to Unit 33,

03:55.436 --> 03:57.268
We've got a 55-year-old male
with chest pain,

03:57.268 --> 03:59.610
prior M.I.,
near Pioneer Square. Over.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.442
UNIT 33 RESPONDING.
(beep)

04:01.442 --> 04:03.614
YOU HAVE TO GO ALREADY?

04:03.614 --> 04:05.015
I'M AFRAID SO.

04:05.015 --> 04:06.617
(sighs)

04:06.617 --> 04:08.349
OKAY.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.281
HEY, UH...

04:10.281 --> 04:11.982
YOU WANT TO COME, TOO?

04:11.982 --> 04:13.624
(Alex) YOU'RE WITH ME

04:13.624 --> 04:14.985
ALL DAY?

04:14.985 --> 04:17.388
WE JUST WANT TO GET TO KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, DR. KAREV.

04:17.388 --> 04:18.529
SEE YOU IN YOUR ELEMENT.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.331
IT'S IMPORTANT WE CHOOSE
JUST THE RIGHT AMBASSADOR

04:20.331 --> 04:21.592
FOR OUR BRAND.

04:21.592 --> 04:24.335
YOUR BRAND? THIS HOSPITAL
ISN'T A LUXURY CAR.

04:24.335 --> 04:25.296
HOLD PLEASE.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.467
(camera shutter clicking)

04:26.467 --> 04:27.998
UH, GOOD MORNING,
DR. KAREV.

04:27.998 --> 04:30.641
PRE-ROUNDS WENT WELL.
GOT YOUR SCANS.

04:30.641 --> 04:32.343
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHO THE CREEPY LADY IS

04:32.343 --> 04:33.674
TAKING OUR PHOTO?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.005
UH, I'M AMRITA.

04:35.005 --> 04:36.577
I DO PUBLIC IMAGE ASSESSMENT
FOR PEGASUS HORIZONS.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.748
THEY'RE BUYING THE HOSPITAL,

04:37.748 --> 04:40.050
AND THEY WANT A FACE
TO SLAP ON SOME POSTERS.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.412
(clicking continues)

04:41.412 --> 04:42.383
AND THEY CHOSE YOU?

04:42.383 --> 04:43.554
(elevator bell dings)

04:43.554 --> 04:45.416
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:45.416 --> 04:47.758
MAYA NOEL, 13 DAYS OLD

04:47.758 --> 04:50.060
WITH GASTROSCHISIS
AND STAGED SILO REPAIR.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.723
SHE WAS BORN WITH HER INTESTINES
OUTSIDE OF HER BODY.

04:52.723 --> 04:54.395
THEY'VE BEEN TOO SWOLLEN
TO FIT BACK INSIDE.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.598
IS THAT... AM I
LOOKING AT A BAG OF ORGANS?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.770
WE'VE BEEN GRADUALLY COMPRESSING
THE ORGANS A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY

04:59.770 --> 05:01.502
TO HELP THEM FIT
BACK INSIDE THE BODY.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.635
IMAGINE GOING TWO WEEKS WITHOUT
GETTING TO HOLD YOUR OWN BABY.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.507
(Alex) WELL, GOOD NEWS.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.308
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FINALLY GONNA
BE ABLE TO CLOSE HER UP.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.840
TODAY IS THE DAY.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.442
OH, MY GOD.

05:11.442 --> 05:13.344
OH, THANK YOU.

05:13.344 --> 05:14.585
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

05:14.585 --> 05:16.387
(laughs)
HOLD PLEASE.

05:16.387 --> 05:19.350
(camera shutter clicking)

05:23.524 --> 05:25.396
THANKS, GUYS.

05:25.396 --> 05:29.800
IF I COULD JUST HAVE YOU
SIGN THIS RELEASE.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.463
YEAH.

05:32.463 --> 05:33.804
THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE
WITH SICK KIDS.

05:33.804 --> 05:35.506
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO OP.

05:35.506 --> 05:36.807
I WAS JUST TRYING--
LOOK, I DON'T CARE,
ALL RIGHT?

05:36.807 --> 05:38.338
THE NEXT KID
I'M ABOUT TO GO SEE

05:38.338 --> 05:39.470
IS A VERY SENSITIVE CASE.

05:39.470 --> 05:40.811
ALL RIGHT?
YOU DON'T SAY A WORD.

05:40.811 --> 05:42.342
YOU DO NOT TAKE A PHOTO.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.445
YOU'RE A SHADOW,
A FREAKING SHADOW. GOT IT?

05:44.445 --> 05:47.578
PROTECTIVE OF YOUR PATIENTS.
PASSIONATE. I LIKE IT.

05:47.578 --> 05:50.020
FORGET IT.
YOU'RE WAITING IN THE HALL.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.482
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:51.482 --> 05:52.653
(camera shutter clicks)

05:52.653 --> 05:53.824
GREAT. GREAT.

05:53.824 --> 05:55.486
NOW IF YOU COULD JUST...
(sighs)

05:55.486 --> 05:57.458
MOVE A LITTLE CLOSER
TO HER--HIM.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.789
OH, I-I'M THE HIM.
SHE'S THE HER.

05:58.789 --> 06:01.562
I-I--NO, I WAS BORN A HER,
AND JESS WAS A HIM.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.963
I GET IT'S CONFUSING.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.364
YEAH.
(sighs) YOU'RE KIDDING.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.936
CAHILL'S GOT MORE
OF YOU GUYS TRAILING ME?

06:05.936 --> 06:07.097
HE'S "TRAILING ME."

06:07.097 --> 06:08.469
IT'S FOR THIS
BRAND AMBASSADOR THING

06:08.469 --> 06:09.570
OR SOMETHING.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.871
IT'S NOT A--
NOT A BIG DEAL.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.443
JUST, UH, WE'LL BE DONE
IN A SEC.
READY?

06:12.443 --> 06:15.406
ONE, TWO, AND THREE.
(clicks)

06:15.406 --> 06:25.656
HOW'S THAT?

06:29.089 --> 06:30.461
YOU REALLY THINK IT'S OKAY

06:30.461 --> 06:31.692
TO LET THESE PEOPLE
IN HERE?

06:31.692 --> 06:32.863
THE PATIENT'S FINE
WITH IT.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.024
IF HE GETS TO STAY,
I GET TO STAY.

06:34.024 --> 06:34.995
IT'S THE AMBASSADOR THING.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.166
YOU THINK THIS KID
MAKES YOU LOOK GOOD.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.528
I ALWAYS LOOK GOOD.

06:37.528 --> 06:39.500
WE'RE AT U.W. TOGETHER.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.102
I'M A SOPHOMORE,
AND BRIAN'S A FRESHMAN.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.634
AND IS THAT
WHERE YOU MET?

06:43.634 --> 06:46.036
UH, ACTUALLY, NO.
UH, DR. KAREV INTRODUCED US.

06:46.036 --> 06:47.578
A FEW YEARS AGO,
I BOOKED AN APPOINTMENT

06:47.578 --> 06:49.409
TO SEE HOW OLD
I HAD TO BE TO,

06:49.409 --> 06:50.581
YOU KNOW, START THE PROCESS.

06:50.581 --> 06:51.742
HE WAS 14.

06:51.742 --> 06:53.444
AND, UH, DR. KAREV
TOLD ME

06:53.444 --> 06:54.915
ABOUT THIS
TRANSGENDER SUPPORT GROUP.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.017
THAT'S WHERE JESS AND I MET.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.789
BRIAN WALKED IN
THAT FIRST DAY,

06:58.789 --> 07:00.621
AND ALL I COULD THINK WAS,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.823
OH, MY GOD.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.994
HE'S SO CUTE.

07:03.994 --> 07:04.925
(giggles)

07:06.426 --> 07:08.058
I THOUGHT
HE'D NEVER NOTICE ME.

07:08.058 --> 07:09.530
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
NOT TO NOTICE YOU.

07:11.061 --> 07:14.665
I'VE BEEN SAVING UP FOR THIS
EVER SINCE THAT APPOINTMENT.

07:14.665 --> 07:18.008
WELL, DR. KAREV, YOU REALLY
CHANGED BRIAN'S LIFE.

07:18.008 --> 07:20.671
WELL, YOU COULD ALSO SAY THAT
I'M CHANGING BRIAN'S LIFE,

07:20.671 --> 07:21.972
TODAY, IN SURGERY,

07:21.972 --> 07:24.014
WHERE I'LL BE
TAKING THE LEAD.

07:24.014 --> 07:25.946
(man) AND WHAT IS
TODAY'S SURGERY EXACTLY?

07:25.946 --> 07:26.917
A FULL GENDER REASSIGNMENT?

07:26.917 --> 07:28.779
OH, NO. UH,
NOTHING THAT DRASTIC YET.

07:28.779 --> 07:31.081
TODAY WE'RE JUST
CHOPPING OFF MY BOOBS.

07:31.081 --> 07:32.182
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH QUESTIONS.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.084
UH, EDWARDS, WILSON,
TAKE THESE GUYS OUTSIDE.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.656
MM.

07:38.929 --> 07:41.161
JACKSON AVERY AS THE NEW FACE
OF SEATTLE GRACE...

07:41.161 --> 07:42.533
(chuckles)

07:42.533 --> 07:43.694
NOW THAT MAKES SENSE.

07:43.694 --> 07:45.035
ALEX ALSO MAKES SENSE.

07:45.035 --> 07:46.166
IF YOU WANT A FACE
THAT'S UNSHAVEN

07:46.166 --> 07:47.998
AND SWEATING LIGHT BEER.

07:47.998 --> 07:49.169
(door opens)

07:49.169 --> 07:50.541
YOU'VE GOT THIS
IN THE BAG.

07:50.541 --> 07:51.872
WALK WITH ME.
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.003
THEY LIKE AVERY'S LOOKS
AND THEY LIKE HIS NAME.

07:53.003 --> 07:54.545
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE
EITHER OF THOSE.

07:54.545 --> 07:55.706
GEE, THANKS.

07:55.706 --> 07:56.947
(whispering)
BUT YOU HAVE AFRICA.

07:56.947 --> 07:58.108
LEAD WITH AFRICA.

07:58.108 --> 07:59.249
HE'S A SCRAPPER AND A FIGHTER.

07:59.249 --> 08:00.611
NOW SOME PEOPLE
FIND THAT CHARMING,

08:00.611 --> 08:01.952
BUT YOU'RE AN AVERY.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.584
USE IT. OWN IT.
IMPRESS THEM.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.155
THEY WANT TO BE IMPRESSED.

08:05.155 --> 08:06.687
AND I SAW YOUR BREAKFAST.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.158
YOUR BRAIN CAN'T FUNCTION
ON POWDERED SUGAR.

08:08.158 --> 08:09.520
HERE.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.692
OH, YOU JUST CARRY THOSE
AROUND IN YOUR POCKET?

08:11.692 --> 08:13.664
(indistinct conversations)

08:13.664 --> 08:15.526
EVERY TIME I TOUCH THIS THING,
IT DELETES ANOTHER PATIENT.
(touch screen clicking)

08:15.526 --> 08:17.067
(error tone beeps)
IT DELETES A PATIENT?

08:17.067 --> 08:18.198
I DID THE EXACT SAME THING
THIS MORNING.
(beep)

08:18.198 --> 08:20.731
HERE. LET ME SEE...
(clicking)

08:20.731 --> 08:21.872
SOMETHING.

08:21.872 --> 08:23.003
WHO ARE YOUR STALKERS?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.675
OH, UH, THE NEW GUYS

08:24.675 --> 08:26.006
ARE LOOKING FOR
A HOSPITAL SHOW PONY--

08:26.006 --> 08:27.878
A FACE FOR THE BROCHURE.

08:27.878 --> 08:29.039
YEAH, KAREV'S MY COMPETITION.

08:29.039 --> 08:30.581
MM. IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT.
(chuckles) YOU CAN'T.

08:30.581 --> 08:31.912
BITE ME, PRETTY BOY.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.043
AND WHY ARE THERE NO WOMEN
IN THE RUNNING?

08:33.043 --> 08:35.215
OH, THERE WAS.
I TURNED THEM DOWN.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.148
THIS FACE ONLY GOES
ON THE NOBEL BROCHURE.
(laughs)

08:38.148 --> 08:40.520
(touch screen clicks)
(Alana) AND HERE WE HAVE

08:40.520 --> 08:43.994
A FULLY CENTRALIZED
ELECTRONIC RECORDS SYSTEM.

08:43.994 --> 08:46.997
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT ANY CLIENT AT ANYTIME.

08:46.997 --> 08:48.298
(clicking)
SMART, STREAMLINED, EFFICIENT--

08:48.298 --> 08:50.300
OH, EFFICIENT.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.102
IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT

08:52.102 --> 08:53.934
IF IT DIDN'T KEEP DELETING
MY PATIENTS.
(clicks, beeps)

08:53.934 --> 08:55.235
SING IT, GREY.
DON'T ENCOURAGE HER.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.738
WHY NOT?
CAHILL DESERVES IT.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.169
THIS MORNING SHE GAVE ME
THIS WHOLE LOAD OF CRAP

08:59.169 --> 09:00.611
ABOUT HOW TO TALK
TO THE BUYERS.

09:00.611 --> 09:02.743
EMPHASIZE SPORTS MEDICINE.
DON'T EMPHASIZE MY RESEARCH.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.815
SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO JEOPARDIZE THE SALE,

09:04.815 --> 09:07.017
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

09:07.017 --> 09:08.178
(Richard) RESEARCH IS RISKY.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.620
MM-HMM.
THE SUITS DON'T LIKE IT.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.083
WHEREAS, IF YOU'VE GOT
THE SEAHAWKS AS PATIENTS...

09:13.083 --> 09:14.985
(Callie) AH. SHE DOESN'T
CALL 'EM "PATIENTS."

09:14.985 --> 09:16.286
SHE CALLS 'EM "CLIENTS,"
LIKE WE'RE, UH,

09:16.286 --> 09:18.088
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

09:18.088 --> 09:19.059
REAL ESTATE AGENTS
LOOK HAPPY.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.831
MAYBE WE'LL BE HAPPY.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.833
(chuckles)
THEIR BENEFITS PACKAGE SAYS
THEY HAVE DENTAL,

09:22.833 --> 09:24.164
INCLUDING ORTHODONTICS.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.136
NOW I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A FAMILY HISTORY

09:26.136 --> 09:27.668
OF VERY STRAIGHT TEETH,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.600
BUT TUCK MAY GROW UP
AND NEED BRACES.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.841
I DON'T KNOW.

09:30.841 --> 09:32.673
BUT IF HE DOES,
THEY HAVE DENTAL.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.845
THAT'S--I'M JUST GONNA
FOCUS ON THAT.

09:34.845 --> 09:37.047
NO, NO, NO.
WE CANNOT SETTLE.

09:37.047 --> 09:40.150
WE HAVE TO RISE UP
AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

09:40.150 --> 09:41.211
(inhales)

09:41.211 --> 09:43.954
YOU'VE DONE PLENTY.

09:43.954 --> 09:47.057
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:47.057 --> 09:48.719
MAYBE THOSE OF US
FROM THE PLANE

09:48.719 --> 09:50.761
SHOULD KEEP OUR HEADS DOWN
FOR A WHILE.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.125
(huffs)

09:55.125 --> 09:56.627
AM I CRAZY?

09:56.627 --> 09:58.198
I MEAN, AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT THINKS

09:58.198 --> 10:00.671
THESE... WONKS
ARE GONNA DESTROY THE PLACE?

10:00.671 --> 10:02.202
NO.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.775
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY AT ALL.

10:06.677 --> 10:09.609
I JUST FELT LIKE,
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR WOULD I BE

10:09.609 --> 10:12.612
IF I DIDN'T TRY TO HELP OUT
ALL THOSE AFRICAN KIDS.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.084
IT TAKES A LOT OF DEDICATION

10:14.084 --> 10:16.246
TO GET A PROGRAM LIKE THAT
OFF THE GROUND.

10:16.246 --> 10:17.748
(tablet error tone beeps)

10:17.748 --> 10:19.089
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

10:19.089 --> 10:20.991
YOU PUT THESE IDEAS
INTO HER HEAD.

10:20.991 --> 10:22.152
HIS HEAD.

10:22.152 --> 10:24.054
AND WHILE I DO SUPPORT
THE DECISION,

10:24.054 --> 10:26.196
BELIEVE ME, HE CAME TO IT
ALL ON HIS OWN.

10:26.196 --> 10:28.198
SHE'S BARELY
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL...

10:28.198 --> 10:29.159
HE.
FOR GOD SAKE.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.300
SHE IS A CHILD!

10:30.300 --> 10:31.732
HE.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.063
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS!
HE! HE!

10:33.063 --> 10:34.735
JESS, IS EVERYTHING OKAY HERE?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.007
ARE YOU THE ONE?

10:37.007 --> 10:38.268
WHAT?

10:38.268 --> 10:40.070
ARE YOU THE ONE...

10:40.070 --> 10:41.942
WHO WANTS TO HACK
MY LITTLE GIRL INTO PIECES?!
(camera shutter clicking)

10:41.942 --> 10:43.373
HEY, HEY, CALM DOWN.

10:43.373 --> 10:45.275
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
(clicks)

10:48.248 --> 10:49.219
(instrumental music playing)

10:49.219 --> 10:50.751
(woman) PEGASUS...

10:50.751 --> 10:53.053
RACING YOU
TO A BRIGHTER TOMORROW.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.224
(Callie) OH.

10:54.224 --> 10:55.355
I'M GONNA HURL.
(chuckles)

10:55.355 --> 10:57.427
MM. CLICK THERE
WHERE IT SAYS "HOSPITALS."

10:57.427 --> 10:59.289
HOLY CRAP.

10:59.289 --> 11:01.091
THEY MUST OWN HALF
THE HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTRY.

11:01.091 --> 11:03.293
THEY'RE THE GUYS WHO BOUGHT OUT
PORTLAND GEN LAST YEAR.

11:03.293 --> 11:04.264
RIGHT THERE.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.435
HEY.

11:05.435 --> 11:06.797
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.939
"HAND IN HAND,
WE'LL WALK TOGETHER,

11:08.939 --> 11:10.801
PARTNERS ON THE ROAD
TO YOUR BRIGHTER TOMORROW."

11:10.801 --> 11:12.142
THIS IS WHO'S BUYING US.

11:12.142 --> 11:13.273
THAT'S A CUTE LOGO.
SOFIA WOULD LIKE IT.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.444
SHE LIKES HORSES.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.747
IT'S NOT A HORSE.
IT'S A PEGASUS.

11:16.747 --> 11:18.308
AND IT WANTS
TO HOLD YOUR HAND.

11:18.308 --> 11:19.679
HMM?
THIS WEB SITE HAS

11:19.679 --> 11:21.311
NOT ONE TANGIBLE PIECE
OF INFORMATION

11:21.311 --> 11:22.282
ABOUT THE COMPANY
OR HEALTH CARE.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.854
WHY DOESN'T THIS BOTHER YOU?

11:23.854 --> 11:26.216
IT DOES,
BUT THEY'RE BUYING US.

11:26.216 --> 11:28.058
AND WE ARE ALL ABOUT TO
GALLOP DOWN THE ROAD

11:28.058 --> 11:29.689
TOWARDS A BRIGHTER TOMORROW.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.861
(Callie) OHH-HO.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.262
SO, YOU KNOW,
COOL YOUR HEELS.

11:32.262 --> 11:34.925
CHILL OUT. THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

11:37.227 --> 11:38.368
SHE JUST TOLD ME
TO COOL MY HEELS.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.071
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN ME
TO COOL MY HEELS?

11:41.071 --> 11:43.734
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT A ROAD TRIP?

11:44.905 --> 11:47.808
I'M SORRY.
I... LOST MY COOL.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.179
YOU THINK?

11:49.179 --> 11:51.812
IT'S JUST, I LEARNED ABOUT
THIS SURGERY LAST NIGHT

11:51.812 --> 11:53.143
IN AN E-MAIL.

11:53.143 --> 11:55.185
I MEAN, A STUPID E-MAIL.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.788
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT...

11:57.788 --> 11:59.719
ANY OF THIS.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.352
GUYS, YOU CAN GO.

12:02.352 --> 12:04.394
(security radio chatter)

12:04.394 --> 12:07.157
WE'RE FINE HERE.
SCRAM.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.298
MM-HMM.

12:08.298 --> 12:09.830
(security radio chatter
continues)

12:09.830 --> 12:11.031
LET'S GO.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.262
(man speaks indistinctly)

12:12.262 --> 12:13.934
(sighs)
A SURGERY LIKE THIS

12:13.934 --> 12:15.806
IS A BIG ADJUSTMENT
FOR ANY PARENT,

12:15.806 --> 12:18.338
LET ALONE IF YOU'RE HEARING
ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.410
SO LET'S JUST TAKE A BREATH
AND...

12:20.410 --> 12:22.272
(Brian) DAD.
(metal clinks)

12:22.272 --> 12:23.844
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.280
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:30.280 --> 12:31.381
HI.
HI.

12:31.381 --> 12:32.783
MY NAME'S CALLIOPE...

12:32.783 --> 12:34.284
T--

12:34.284 --> 12:35.255
PLANT...

12:35.255 --> 12:36.486
TAIN.

12:36.486 --> 12:39.029
PLANTAIN.

12:39.029 --> 12:40.861
AND THIS IS...

12:40.861 --> 12:42.793
MY HUSBAND.

12:42.793 --> 12:46.296
UM, UH... JULIO PLANTAIN.

12:46.296 --> 12:48.368
AND HE NEEDS A DOCTOR.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.840
CAN I SEE SOME I.D.?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.442
HE HAS CHEST PAIN.

12:52.442 --> 12:54.274
(pants)

12:54.274 --> 12:55.976
YEAH.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.078
SO BY THE END
OF THIS SEMINAR,

12:58.078 --> 13:00.951
I EXPECT ALL OF YOU
TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM

13:00.951 --> 13:02.883
BASIC WOUND CLOSURES

13:02.883 --> 13:06.486
USING THE INTERRUPTED
2-LAYER TECHNIQUE.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.258
I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY
IN THE BACK.

13:08.258 --> 13:11.391
I CAN FEEL HIM
WATCHING ME.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.893
NO, IT'S JUST ME.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.025
I LIKE TO LOOK AT YOU.

13:17.427 --> 13:18.929
QUICK QUESTION, DR. AVERY.

13:18.929 --> 13:20.430
DO YOU USE THIS TECHNIQUE
MORE OFTEN

13:20.430 --> 13:22.933
WHEN YOU PERFORM BUTT LIFTS
OR BREAST IMPLANTS?

13:22.933 --> 13:24.875
(Stephanie) ACTUALLY,
ISN'T THIS THE TECHNIQUE

13:24.875 --> 13:26.376
YOU USED TO ATTACH THE FACE

13:26.376 --> 13:28.078
ON TO YOUR LAST
FACE TRANSPLANT PATIENT?

13:28.078 --> 13:29.409
WELL, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
DONE--

13:29.409 --> 13:30.540
SIDEBAR. WHAT DO YOU FIND
MORE FULFILLING--

13:30.540 --> 13:32.312
LIPOSUCTION
OR BODY SCULPTING?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.884
SIDEBAR. ISN'T IT TRUE
YOU'VE COMPLETED

13:33.884 --> 13:35.045
MORE SUCCESSFUL SKIN GRAFTS

13:35.045 --> 13:36.216
THAN ANY OTHER DOCTOR
IN THIS HOSPITAL?

13:36.216 --> 13:39.149
UM... YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:39.149 --> 13:41.451
SAVING YOUR ASS. YOU HIT
A ROCK AND YOU'RE SINKING.

13:41.451 --> 13:44.354
ICEBERG AHEAD, CAPTAIN.

13:44.354 --> 13:46.356
LARRY.

13:46.356 --> 13:49.259
YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT
A FREE STATION RIGHT OVER HERE

13:49.259 --> 13:51.261
IF YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR HAND
AT SOME ACTUAL SURGERY.

13:51.261 --> 13:52.502
(chuckles)
PLEASE.

13:52.502 --> 13:55.135
(cell phone rings)

13:55.135 --> 13:57.037
(ring)
OH, EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.209
(beeps)
HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.

13:59.209 --> 14:00.340
(Jackson) What's up? I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.872
I KNOW AND I SWEAR
I WOULDN'T CALL

14:01.872 --> 14:03.213
UNLESS IT WERE AN EMERGENCY.

14:03.213 --> 14:04.544
LOOK, I DID A RIDE ALONG TODAY,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.476
AND WE GOT THIS CALL--A KID,
ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD, HIT AND RUN.

14:06.476 --> 14:07.878
DAMN IT.
HE'S STILL LOCKED DOWN.

14:07.878 --> 14:09.249
We can't intubate.
Can you ventilate him?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.480
BARELY. HIS SATs
ARE STILL IN THE GUTTER.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.022
OKAY,
LET'S GET HIM BACKBOARDED.

14:12.022 --> 14:14.054
WE NEED TO LOAD AND GO.
SEATTLE PRES IS SLAMMED,

14:14.054 --> 14:15.325
so they're diverting us
to Redmond,

14:15.325 --> 14:16.987
but that's an hour away,
and this kid... (sighs)

14:16.987 --> 14:19.429
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN HOUR,
JACKSON. HE DOESN'T.

14:19.429 --> 14:20.560
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
HOW ARE HIS VITALS?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.362
BAD. WE'VE GOT NO AIRWAY.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.493
I CAN'T CRIKE.

14:23.493 --> 14:25.065
HE'S GOT SUB-Q EMPHYSEMA.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.267
HE WILL DIE EN ROUTE
IF WE HAVE TO GO WAY OUT THERE.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.538
HE WILL DIE.

14:28.538 --> 14:31.171
ARE YOU ASKING
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.173
(siren wailing,
emergency radio chatter)

14:33.173 --> 14:34.945
IF I AM, WILL YOU DO IT?

14:42.352 --> 14:43.513
AND A FEW YEARS AGO,

14:43.513 --> 14:45.055
WE RENOVATED THE WAITING ROOM
TO PROVIDE--

14:45.055 --> 14:46.356
CHIEF, A MOMENT, PLEASE.

14:46.356 --> 14:48.218
GIVE ME A MOMENT.

14:48.218 --> 14:50.060
(indistinct conversations)

14:50.060 --> 14:52.222
(sighs) KEPNER'S CALLING
WITH A HIT-AND-RUN KID.

14:52.222 --> 14:54.064
HE'S IN BAD SHAPE.
WAIT. KEPNER'S IN THE FIELD?

14:54.064 --> 14:55.295
THEY DIVERTED HER TO REDMOND.
OKAY? WE'RE CLOSER. MUCH CLOSER.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.267
SO I CAN ARRANGE--
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

14:57.267 --> 14:59.299
WE ARE NOT
A TRAUMA CENTER ANYMORE.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.001
IF WE TAKE THEM IN,
AND SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM--

15:01.001 --> 15:02.472
CHIEF, IT'S A KID.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.174
PROTOCOL DICTATES
THE PATIENT GOES

15:04.174 --> 15:06.306
TO THE NEAREST TRAUMA CENTER,
AND THAT'S NOT US.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.477
I'M SORRY.

15:07.477 --> 15:09.009
(indistinct conversations
continue)

15:09.009 --> 15:10.310
YOU NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE SEMINAR.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.282
AND YOU HAVE TO
STEP IT UP.

15:12.282 --> 15:14.684
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
A PEP TALK, TOUGH LOVE?
(chuckles)

15:14.684 --> 15:17.147
NO AMOUNT OF TOUGH LOVE IS GONNA
MAKE UP FOR THE BABIES...
(cell phone chimes)

15:17.147 --> 15:18.688
ALEX SAVES
ON A DAILY BASIS.

15:18.688 --> 15:20.991
CAN I TRUST YOU?

15:20.991 --> 15:23.393
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE
THE PATIENT?

15:23.393 --> 15:24.694
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
THE PART.

15:24.694 --> 15:26.226
OH,
AND I'M NATURALLY VIVACIOUS.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.628
YEAH, "MANIC'S" MORE A WORD
FOR IT. (clears throat)

15:28.628 --> 15:30.330
I'M SO SORRY FOR THE WAIT.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.363
WE'RE GONNA GET A DOCTOR TO YOU
JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

15:33.363 --> 15:34.664
WELL, IT REALLY WASN'T
A WAIT.

15:34.664 --> 15:37.307
EW. WOW. YOU'RE A HAPPY ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

15:37.307 --> 15:38.468
HE'S UP THERE, TOO.

15:38.468 --> 15:40.010
HMM?

15:40.010 --> 15:41.311
UGH.

15:41.311 --> 15:42.642
(laughs)
(whispers)
OH, GOD. IT'S LIKE...

15:42.642 --> 15:45.145
HELLO, I'M DR. MATTOO. YOU CAN
CALL ME KAN IF YOU'D LIKE.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.446
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF YOU WEREN'T EXPERIENCING

15:46.446 --> 15:47.978
SOME PAIN OR DISCOMFORT.

15:47.978 --> 15:50.180
I APOLOGIZE IF WE
EXACERBATED THAT WITH A WAIT.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.022
UH, WE GOT HERE, LIKE,
HALF A MINUTE AGO. (chuckles)

15:52.022 --> 15:53.183
IT'S...
(Richard chuckles)

15:53.183 --> 15:54.954
OKAY, MR. PLANTAIN.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.057
UH, IT'S LIKE THE FRUIT.
IT'S CUBAN.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.258
CAN YOU SPELL THAT
FOR ME?

15:58.258 --> 16:01.261
UM, P-L-A-N...

16:01.261 --> 16:03.393
UH, T-A-I-N.

16:03.393 --> 16:04.694
(touch screen clicking)
WELL, MR. PLANTAIN,
WE KNOW YOU HAVE

16:04.694 --> 16:06.366
A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR
YOUR HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.338
AND WE ARE HONORED THAT
YOU'VE CHOSEN US TODAY.

16:08.338 --> 16:10.040
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.701
SAW YOUR E.K.G.
IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

16:11.701 --> 16:13.273
HOW ARE
YOU FEELING TODAY?

16:13.273 --> 16:14.974
UH, WELL, UH, DR. KAN,

16:14.974 --> 16:18.378
UH, YOU KNOW,
THE LAST 24 HOURS, I-I'VE--

16:18.378 --> 16:20.250
UH, UH, SORRY. LET ME--
LET ME PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.481
WHAT BROUGHT YOU IN TODAY?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.313
I'M SORRY. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH... (clears throat)

16:23.313 --> 16:25.185
ASKING HIM HOW HE FEELS?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.486
THAT COULD TAKE US
DOWN THE WRONG ROAD,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.318
AND BECAUSE YOUR TIME
IS VALUABLE TO US,

16:28.318 --> 16:30.720
WE DON'T WANT TO GET OFF
ON ANY TANGENTS.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.422
MM. WELL, IF YOU ASK HIM
HOW HE'S FEELING,

16:32.422 --> 16:34.994
MAYBE HE'LL TELL YOU THAT
HE'S...

16:34.994 --> 16:36.566
HE'S BLUE, 'CAUSE...

16:36.566 --> 16:38.098
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, HIS COMPANY

16:38.098 --> 16:39.569
WAS JUST PURCHASED
BY A BIGGER COMPANY...
YEAH.

16:39.569 --> 16:41.131
THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE.

16:41.131 --> 16:43.133
AND, YOU KNOW, HE CAN'T
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT

16:43.133 --> 16:45.475
'CAUSE... (laughs)
I'M THE SELF-INVOLVED TYPE.

16:45.475 --> 16:46.436
(laughs)

16:46.436 --> 16:47.677
YOU KNOW, WE JUST, LIKE,

16:47.677 --> 16:49.209
YOU KNOW, SHOP ONLINE
AND REDECORATE THE HOUSE.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.211
AND SO HE'S BEEN--
HE'S BEEN, UH, HANGING OUT

16:51.211 --> 16:53.483
AT THE... LOCAL WATERING HOLE,

16:53.483 --> 16:57.047
WHERE HE HAS BEEN
BUMMING CIGARETTES.

16:57.047 --> 17:00.090
AND, UH, NOW HE'S EXPERIENCING
SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
(coughing)

17:00.090 --> 17:01.551
SO IF YOU ASK HIM
WHAT BROUGHT HIM IN TODAY,

17:01.551 --> 17:03.423
HE'S JUST GONNA TELL YOU
"SHORTNESS OF BREATH."

17:03.423 --> 17:05.725
AND THEN YOU'D MISS THE WHOLE
CIGARETTE CONNECTION. (laughs)

17:05.725 --> 17:07.097
(coughs)

17:07.097 --> 17:09.199
I ASK ABOUT SMOKING
ON SCREEN TWO.

17:11.661 --> 17:13.203
FINE. WHATEVER.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.605
OKAY, LET ME GET BACK
TO SCREEN ONE.
(clicks)

17:15.605 --> 17:16.766
(error tone beeps)

17:16.766 --> 17:18.408
DARN IT.
THE SCREEN FROZE.
(click)

17:18.408 --> 17:19.369
(beep)

17:19.369 --> 17:21.071
SORRY.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

17:21.071 --> 17:22.442
UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
EXIT THE SYSTEM...
(clicking)

17:22.442 --> 17:24.244
AND TAKE US BACK
TO THE TOP.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.716
UH, IT-IT-IT'S OKAY.
UH, TAKE--TAKE YOUR TIME.
(beep)

17:26.716 --> 17:28.078
CAN'T REALLY DO THAT.

17:28.078 --> 17:29.549
WE'VE ONLY GOT 15 MINUTES
TOGETHER TODAY.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.780
(clicks)
THERE WE GO.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.322
MR. PLANTAIN,

17:32.322 --> 17:33.583
CAN YOU SPELL THAT
FOR ME?

17:33.583 --> 17:34.684
(phone rings)

17:42.462 --> 17:46.296
WOW. THEY REALLY
CLEARED THE PLACE OUT.

17:46.296 --> 17:48.067
OKAY, WHERE DO WE START?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.470
YOU CAN START
BY GUARDING THE DOOR.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.372
HEY, NO ONE
CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.304
NO ONE COMES IN.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

17:54.304 --> 17:55.445
MM-HMM.

17:55.445 --> 17:57.377
OKAY.

18:00.310 --> 18:02.782
(exhales)

18:02.782 --> 18:05.455
(Jo) MEDUSA ME ALL YOU WANT.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING IN.

18:05.455 --> 18:06.786
(Meredith) I'M AN ATTENDING

18:06.786 --> 18:08.718
AND I'M ORDERING YOU
TO LET ME IN.

18:08.718 --> 18:10.520
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
MY ATTENDING TODAY, SO--

18:10.520 --> 18:12.462
DON'T MAKE ME FORCE YOU.

18:12.462 --> 18:13.793
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.094
HEY.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.426
JO. IT'S OKAY.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.368
I PAGED HER. SHE'S COOL.

18:18.368 --> 18:19.529
(elevator bell dings)

18:19.529 --> 18:20.530
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.402
I WOULD NEVER ORDINARILY
SPEAK TO YOU THAT WAY

18:22.402 --> 18:23.833
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
ON YOUR SERVICE AGAIN SOON.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.275
HOW CAN I HELP?

18:25.275 --> 18:26.576
YOU'RE BARELY 18.

18:26.576 --> 18:28.438
YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF YOU WAKE UP,

18:28.438 --> 18:29.809
YOU REALIZE
THIS WAS ALL A MISTAKE?

18:29.809 --> 18:33.183
THIS ISN'T A HAIRCUT
OR SOME MEANINGLESS TATTOO.

18:33.183 --> 18:34.514
THIS IS MY LIFE.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.645
THIS IS ME.

18:35.645 --> 18:37.747
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:37.747 --> 18:39.819
ALL RIGHT.
YOU FEEL DIFFERENT.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.752
YOU WANT TO BELONG. OKAY.

18:42.752 --> 18:45.255
I GET THAT, BUT YOU HAVE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD--

18:45.255 --> 18:47.227
I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

18:47.227 --> 18:49.429
I'M JUST ASKING
FOR YOU TO WAIT.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.201
BRIAN FEELS LIKE
HE'S DYING INSIDE.

18:51.201 --> 18:52.802
WE BOTH DO.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.736
IF YOU'D LISTEN,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.438
BRIAN WILL TELL YOU THAT

18:58.438 --> 19:00.370
LIVING INSIDE
OF A BODY LIKE THIS--

19:00.370 --> 19:01.541
I'M SORRY.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.143
COULD YOU JUST...
GIVE US A MOMENT ALONE?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.445
NO, I-I DON'T WANT HER
TO GO.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.177
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
MUTILATING YOURSELF!

19:07.177 --> 19:09.148
I'M NOT!
BRIAN'S JUST TRYING TO BE--

19:09.148 --> 19:10.620
OH, FOR GOD SAKE.
HER NAME IS BRIANNA!

19:10.620 --> 19:12.552
DAD, JUST GET OUT.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.623
GO.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.456
JUST GET OUT!

19:16.456 --> 19:18.428
YOU HEARD HIM.

19:25.635 --> 19:27.637
I JUST SNAGGED A MONITOR,

19:27.637 --> 19:29.869
A VENTILATOR,
AND CENTRAL LINE KITS.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.471
I HAVE SALINE,
INFUSION PUMPS,

19:31.471 --> 19:32.802
A CRASH CART,
AND CRISTINA.

19:32.802 --> 19:34.304
I'M SORRY.
THEY OVERPOWERED ME.

19:34.304 --> 19:35.505
THE FEWER PEOPLE WHO KNOW
ABOUT THIS, THE BETTER GUYS.

19:35.505 --> 19:36.676
I BROUGHT LACKEYS.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.248
WHAT?
NO, I DON'T NEED INTERNS.

19:38.248 --> 19:39.649
NO, THIS ROOM HAS
THREE INTERNAL EXITS.

19:39.649 --> 19:40.950
YOU HAVE A LOOKOUT
ON ONE.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.512
HAPPY, PONYTAIL,
YOU MAN THE DOORS.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.784
MOUSY, UM, BE THE NURSE.
WE NEED GLOVES.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.955
ON IT.

19:45.955 --> 19:47.617
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE
THE NURSE?

19:47.617 --> 19:49.619
WE ARE GONNA NEED LIGHTS.
NO, IF I TURN ON
MORE OVERHEADS...

19:49.619 --> 19:50.790
(cell phone rings)
YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE HALLWAY.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.961
(beeps)
WE CAN USE THOSE.

19:51.961 --> 19:53.623
HELLO. YEP. OKAY.

19:53.623 --> 19:54.794
ALL RIGHT.
THEY'RE PULLING UP NOW.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.396
LET'S GO.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.727
(brakes squeak)

19:57.727 --> 19:58.898
(thuds)
OH!

19:58.898 --> 20:00.670
OH, JEEZ.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.572
I'M OKAY.

20:02.572 --> 20:03.703
THAT'S WHY
WE NEEDED INTERNS.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.335
THE DOOR WON'T OPEN?

20:07.977 --> 20:09.339
WATCH THE I.V.s.

20:09.339 --> 20:10.680
HURRY.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.811
(Matthew) APRIL,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:11.811 --> 20:14.814
I DON'T KNOW. JACKSON?
JACKSON!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.616
(Jackson, strained voice) PULL.
(strained voice)
IT'S STARTING TO GIVE.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.389
(groans)

20:19.389 --> 20:20.690
MORE! MORE!
GO SIT DOWN, MER.

20:20.690 --> 20:21.991
OH, COME ON. JUST BECAUSE
MY UTERUS IS OCCUPIED--

20:21.991 --> 20:23.853
GO SIT DOWN. I'M NOT KIDDING.
GIVE ME YOUR SPOT.

20:23.853 --> 20:25.224
(all grunt)

20:25.224 --> 20:26.426
WHAT--
DON'T WORRY.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.298
I DITCHED MY P.R. CHICK
BEFORE I GOT DOWN HERE.

20:28.298 --> 20:29.429
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT WE--
I PAGED HIM.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.600
YOU'VE GOT AN INCOMING KID.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.631
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
KID-SIZED EQUIPMENT.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.802
I BROUGHT A PEDS CART
WITH A BUNCH OF CRAP.

20:32.802 --> 20:33.963
ALL RIGHT.
ARE WE DOING THIS?

20:33.963 --> 20:35.335
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
ON MY COUNT.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.267
ONE, TWO, THREE!

20:37.267 --> 20:39.969
(all grunting
and speaking indistinctly)

20:39.969 --> 20:42.312
GO, GO, GO, GO.
GO. COME ON, GUYS.

20:42.312 --> 20:43.943
WE NEED TO DO RAPID SEQUENCE
INTUBATION, STAT!

20:51.351 --> 20:52.522
(Nicole)
WE COULD ONLY GET A 20-

20:52.522 --> 20:54.354
AND A 22-GAUGE IN THE FIELD.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.885
I'LL START A CENTRAL LINE.
I NEED SOME LACTATED RINGERS.
ON IT.

20:55.885 --> 20:57.387
I GOT IT.
I CAN SEE THE CORDS.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.358
PARALYTICS ARE WORKING.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.890
ALL RIGHT, UH, I-I NEED
AN E.T. TUBE.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.262
ORANGE DRAWER. ORANGE DRAWER.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.335
I KNEW THAT.

21:05.335 --> 21:07.467
NO CHEST SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
I HAVE TO THROW IN A CHEST TUBE.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.369
(Heather) UH, I THINK I SAW
BETADINE SOMEWHERE.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.501
WAIT A SECOND. DOES ANYBODY
ACTUALLY HAVE CHEST TUBES?

21:11.501 --> 21:12.842
(emergency radio chatter)

21:12.842 --> 21:14.744
(Meredith) I'M TRYING TO SET UP
THIS SALINE DRIP,

21:14.744 --> 21:16.376
AND I CAN'T GET THIS THING
TO STOP BEEPING.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.347
ANYONE?

21:17.347 --> 21:18.808
I CAN GIVE IT A SHOT.

21:18.808 --> 21:20.410
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT FINDING
CHEST TUBES NOW,

21:20.410 --> 21:22.452
BUT I GOT N.G. TUBES. DID
ANYBODY ACTUALLY BRING SUCTION?

21:22.452 --> 21:23.483
UH, THERE'S A PORTABLE
SUCTION IN THE RIG.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.715
OKAY.

21:25.715 --> 21:27.016
I'LL GO GET IT.

21:27.016 --> 21:29.018
THANK YOU.

21:29.018 --> 21:30.490
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:30.490 --> 21:32.422
INCOMING!

21:32.422 --> 21:33.423
LIGHTS.

21:33.423 --> 21:36.766
(beeping continues)

21:36.766 --> 21:40.430
(people speaking indistinctly)

21:40.430 --> 21:43.433
(puffing air)

21:44.674 --> 21:46.376
ALL CLEAR.

21:46.376 --> 21:48.678
(light switches click)

21:48.678 --> 21:50.680
I'M IN. BROOKS, BAG HIM.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.812
SO DR. AVERY
IS TAKING A POWER NAP.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.844
HE LIKES TO REST UP
BEFORE BIG SURGERIES.

21:54.844 --> 21:56.686
AND DR. KAREV HAD
A DENTIST APPOINTMENT.

21:56.686 --> 21:59.489
EVEN DOCTORS HAVE TO GO
TO THE DOCTOR.

21:59.489 --> 22:01.851
MEANWHILE, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE SKIN LAB

22:01.851 --> 22:04.454
WHERE DR. AVERY
GROWS ACTUAL SKIN?

22:04.454 --> 22:06.095
COME ON.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.799
OKAY, I'M BACK. I GOT IT.

22:09.799 --> 22:11.531
(Alex) HELP ME SECURE
THIS N.G. TUBE.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.403
ALL RIGHT, HOOK IT UP
SO WE CAN SUCTION.

22:13.403 --> 22:14.864
OKAY, WHO'S GOT
THE PORTABLE ULTRASOUND?

22:14.864 --> 22:17.367
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:17.367 --> 22:19.709
WE DON'T HAVE ONE?
(suction gurgling)

22:19.709 --> 22:21.941
HAPPY?
ON IT.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.043
(Meredith) WILSON, GET IN HERE.
WE NEED SOME MORE HANDS.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.645
IF THIS KID DIES BECAUSE
YOU BROUGHT RED ALONG

22:25.645 --> 22:27.617
ON SAME LAME IDEA
OF A DATE...

22:27.617 --> 22:29.118
THE RIDE ALONG
WAS A DATE?

22:29.118 --> 22:31.120
I NEED SOME 4x4s TO CONTROL
THE BLEEDING ON THE SCALP.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.351
ALL THREE LINES ARE PATENT.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.524
WE CAN START DOPAMINE
AT 5 MICS PER KILO PER MINUTE,

22:34.524 --> 22:36.355
BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HIS I.V. DRIP RATE.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.457
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR KIDS,
DEPENDING ON SIZE.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.628
UM, ANYBODY HAVE A CALCULATOR?

22:38.628 --> 22:40.430
I ALWAYS ASK A NURSE.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.632
(huffs)

22:42.632 --> 22:43.893
NOT A REAL NURSE.

22:43.893 --> 22:46.866
BROSELOW TAPE SAYS
SAYS HE'S 30 KILOS.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.938
STANDARD CONCENTRATION OF
DOPAMINE IS 1,600 MICS PER cc.

22:48.938 --> 22:50.570
SO 5 TIMES 30 IS 150

22:50.570 --> 22:52.371
TIMES 60 MINUTES IN AN HOUR
IS 9,000.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.573
DIVIDE THAT BY 1,600.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.806
INFUSION RATE IS 5.625 cc's
PER HOUR.

22:56.806 --> 22:58.948
(beeping continues)

22:58.948 --> 23:00.049
WHAT?
I'M REALLY GOOD AT MATH.

23:00.049 --> 23:01.511
OKAY, LET'S, UH,
GIVE HIM 5.6--

23:01.511 --> 23:02.982
EXCEPT WE DON'T HAVE
ANY DOPAMINE, GUYS.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.914
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY
NON-CODE MEDICATIONS AT ALL

23:04.914 --> 23:06.556
UNLESS WE HAVE A NURSE
OR A CODE--

23:06.556 --> 23:08.588
YES, YOU DO.

23:08.588 --> 23:09.759
YOU PAGED HIM, TOO?

23:09.759 --> 23:11.521
WELL, I KNEW
WE WERE GONNA NEED MEDS.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.723
I HAVE THE CODES. TELL ME
WHAT THE PATIENT NEEDS.

23:13.723 --> 23:15.064
(man speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

23:15.064 --> 23:16.726
(scoffs) "DON'T SMOKE"?
THAT WAS HIS BIG ADVICE?

23:16.726 --> 23:18.898
UH, YEAH, HE EXAMINED ME
AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG,

23:18.898 --> 23:20.399
WHICH IN FACT,
IS THE CASE.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.901
OH, HE WAS AN IDIOT.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.973
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE
AN IDIOT.

23:23.973 --> 23:25.505
(lowered voice)
WE'RE JUST WANDERING AROUND.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.876
WE LOOK LIKE INTERLOPERS.

23:26.876 --> 23:29.539
(lowered voice) HEY, YOU KNOW,
LET'S GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE.

23:29.539 --> 23:30.680
YOU ALWAYS LOOK LIKE
YOU BELONG

23:30.680 --> 23:32.011
WHEN YOU'RE CARRYING
A COFFEE.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.483
AH.
YEAH.

23:33.483 --> 23:35.545
NO, WALK WITH PURPOSE.
DON'T LOOK SHIFTY.

23:35.545 --> 23:36.516
I DON'T.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.488
OKAY. OH, LOOK.

23:38.488 --> 23:39.789
OKAY.

23:39.789 --> 23:40.950
(man) WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.121
(woman) THAT MAKES SENSE.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.493
(man) I THINK
ONE MORE DIAGNOSTIC--

23:43.493 --> 23:44.454
(man) DO WE HAVE TIME
FOR THAT?

23:44.454 --> 23:46.596
JUST ONE?
I THINK WE'RE PRETTY GOOD.

23:46.596 --> 23:48.628
(man) ALL RIGHT.
(clears throat loudly)

23:48.628 --> 23:50.530
15 MINUTES A PATIENT?

23:50.530 --> 23:53.533
CAN A DOCTOR LEARN ANYTHING
IN THAT LITTLE TIME?

23:53.533 --> 23:56.205
HUH?

23:56.205 --> 23:58.538
YOU GET REALLY EFFICIENT.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.169
AND PATIENT OUTCOMES
DON'T SUFFER?

24:00.169 --> 24:01.711
WOW. YOU'RE THAT EFFICIENT?

24:01.711 --> 24:04.013
ARE YOU VISITING
A PATIENT?

24:04.013 --> 24:06.576
HMM? OH, UH,
I'M RICHARD WEBBER.

24:06.576 --> 24:09.519
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE,
UH, CALLIE TORRES.

24:09.519 --> 24:11.951
(elevator bell dings)

24:11.951 --> 24:13.623
UM, WE'RE WITH PEGASUS,

24:13.623 --> 24:15.985
AND WE JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN,
GET A LITTLE FEEDBACK.

24:15.985 --> 24:18.828
SEE IF YOU HAD
ANY CONCERNS.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.089
(ding)

24:20.089 --> 24:21.591
REALLY?

24:21.591 --> 24:22.762
REALLY.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.033
OH.

24:25.595 --> 24:28.698
(all chuckling)

24:29.899 --> 24:31.571
OKAY, YOU NEED PROPOFOL...
(beeps)

24:31.571 --> 24:32.972
GENTAMICIN AND, UH...

24:32.972 --> 24:35.144
YOU WILL BE REALLY IMPRESSED
BY OUR NEXT STOP...
DOPAMINE.

24:35.144 --> 24:36.606
DOWNSTAIRS,

24:36.606 --> 24:38.508
WHICH WILL BE THE SITE
FOR OUR NEW HERNIA CLINIC.

24:38.508 --> 24:39.549
(whispers)
GET DOWN THERE NOW.

24:39.549 --> 24:40.880
OKAY.
ALANA.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.612
IS THIS THE GROUP
FROM PEGASUS YOU MENTIONED?

24:42.612 --> 24:44.483
HI, I'M DR. SHEPHERD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.985
HI, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW'S THE TOUR GOING?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.887
GOOD?
WE LIKE WHAT WE'RE SEEING
SO FAR.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.058
OH, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

24:49.058 --> 24:51.020
YOU KNOW THIS IS MORE
THAN JUST A HOSPITAL

24:51.020 --> 24:52.562
FOR A LOT OF US.

24:52.562 --> 24:54.524
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND CHEESY, BUT IT'S, UH,

24:54.524 --> 24:55.665
IT'S LIKE FAMILY.

24:55.665 --> 24:56.896
IT'S LIKE HOME.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.067
GOOD.

24:58.067 --> 24:59.529
HEY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A HUMAN BRAIN UP CLOSE?

24:59.529 --> 25:00.930
I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.572
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU THE UNOFFICIAL TOUR

25:02.572 --> 25:03.873
BY WAY OF
THE THIRD-FLOOR COFFEE CART.

25:03.873 --> 25:05.605
WE'LL HAVE SOME COFFEE FIRST.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

25:05.605 --> 25:06.576
IT'S A LITTLE TASTE
OF SEATTLE.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.007
(sighs deeply)

25:08.007 --> 25:09.639
I'VE GOT FREE FLUID

25:09.639 --> 25:11.510
IN THE LEFT UPPER QUADRANT.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.682
CRAP. WHAT TIME IS IT?

25:12.682 --> 25:14.013
WE HAVE SURGERY ON BRIAN
IN 20 MINUTES.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.685
CAHILL WILL DEFINITELY NOTICE
IF WE DON'T SHOW.

25:15.685 --> 25:16.846
IF YOU GUYS NEED TO GO, GO.
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

25:16.846 --> 25:18.147
LOOK, I'M SEEING
A PNEUMOPERICARDIUM.

25:18.147 --> 25:19.749
OKAY, WE SHOULD PUT IN
ANOTHER CHEST TUBE ON THE LEFT,

25:19.749 --> 25:21.991
JUST TO BE SURE.
WELL, THIS KID NEEDS
AN O.R.

25:21.991 --> 25:23.593
GUYS, WE'VE GOTTA MOVE HIM.

25:23.593 --> 25:24.924
WE CAN'T. NOT TILL WE HAVE
SOMEPLACE FOR HIM TO GO.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.756
THERE'S NO TIME. CAHILL'S ON
HER WAY DOWN HER RIGHT NOW.

25:26.756 --> 25:28.858
(whispers) OKAY.
WE'RE STAYING.

25:28.858 --> 25:30.700
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:30.700 --> 25:32.031
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
CAN I BUY YOU LUNCH?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.563
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE.

25:33.563 --> 25:35.534
WE NEED TO GET DOWN
TO THE HERNIA CLINIC NOW.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.706
(elevator bell dings)

25:36.706 --> 25:37.667
OH, YEAH.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.008
(elevator doors open)

25:39.008 --> 25:41.240
OKAY.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.113
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:44.113 --> 25:46.576
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T I JOIN YOU?

25:46.576 --> 25:48.578
(sighs)

25:50.119 --> 25:52.021
WE GOTTA MOVE THE RIG.
IT'S STILL PARKED OUTSIDE.

25:52.021 --> 25:53.823
IT'S OKAY. GO.
(Jackson) MOVE, GUYS. MOVE!

25:53.823 --> 25:54.984
HURRY!

25:54.984 --> 25:56.185
WE GOTTA GET
THIS THING MOBILE.

25:56.185 --> 25:57.687
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:57.687 --> 25:59.028
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE'S BRADYING DOWN.

25:59.028 --> 26:00.630
WE GOTTA KEEP MOVING.
I'M NOT GETTING A PULSE!

26:00.630 --> 26:02.261
(Meredith)
ROSS, START C.P.R.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.993
DAMN IT. HIS TRACHEA IS
DEVIATED TO THE LEFT.

26:03.993 --> 26:05.865
HIS SATs ARE DROPPING.
I THINK HE HAS A TENSION PNEUMO.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.966
HE HAS BILATERAL CHEST TUBES.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.297
IT MUST HAVE GOTTEN BLOCKED.

26:08.297 --> 26:10.569
SOMEONE FIND ME A 14-GAUGE
CANNULA OR A 16-GAUGE.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.641
WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND,
THE BIGGEST.

26:11.641 --> 26:13.342
UM, GOT IT!
GUYS, WHAT ABOUT CAHILL?

26:13.342 --> 26:15.174
OH, GOD. WHAT--
WHAT IF HE DIES?

26:15.174 --> 26:17.146
WHAT IF WE BROUGHT HIM HERE
AND WHAT IF HE DIES?

26:17.146 --> 26:18.678
HERNIAS ARE ONE OF

26:18.678 --> 26:20.209
THE MOST COMMON
GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES.

26:20.209 --> 26:23.613
AND AS IT TURNS OUT,
ALSO ONE OF THE MOST LUCRATIVE.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.886
WHY DID I AGREE TO THIS?
(Jo) GUYS, WE GOTTA
KEEP MOVING.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.217
(indistinct shouting)
(Cristina) I CAN'T EVEN THINK!

26:28.217 --> 26:29.689
WE HAVE TO MOVE!

26:29.689 --> 26:31.791
CAHILL'S COMING DOWN
RIGHT NOW. IF WE DON'T MOVE--

26:31.791 --> 26:33.993
WE'RE MOVING. YANG.
WAIT ONE SECOND. ONE SECOND.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.695
NOW KEEP IN MIND,

26:35.695 --> 26:37.867
THE SITE
IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION,

26:37.867 --> 26:39.869
BUT YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO USE
A LITTLE IMAGINATION.

26:39.869 --> 26:42.201
BEFORE WE GO IN THERE,
I'D LIKE TO, UH...

26:42.201 --> 26:43.372
(switches click)

26:43.372 --> 26:44.734
(sighs)

26:44.734 --> 26:46.305
OKAY, RIGHT THIS WAY.

26:46.305 --> 26:50.139
AND, UH, WATCH YOUR STEP
PLEASE.

26:58.848 --> 27:00.189
LAST MONTH, I HAD TO DO
A CARDIAC CATH ON A PATIENT

27:00.189 --> 27:02.051
WITH NO SIGNS
OF HEART DISEASE.

27:02.051 --> 27:04.694
IT'S PUTTING THE PATIENT
AT RISK FOR NO REASON.

27:04.694 --> 27:07.156
FORGET PHYSICIAN ADVOCACY.
IT DOESN'T EXIST.

27:07.156 --> 27:09.799
WE HAVE NO SAY IN ANYTHING...
AT ALL.

27:09.799 --> 27:12.061
YEAH, AND IF YOU DECIDE
TO GO CRAZY

27:12.061 --> 27:13.362
AND THINK FOR YOURSELF,

27:13.362 --> 27:16.265
THEY KNOW, LIKE, INSTANTLY.

27:16.265 --> 27:18.037
I SWEAR
THE WALLS HAVE EARS.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.208
ARE YOU THE REPS
FROM PEGASUS?

27:19.208 --> 27:22.071
UH, DR. WEBBER AND DR. TORRES.

27:22.071 --> 27:23.773
OH.
(indistinct conversations)

27:23.773 --> 27:24.944
HI.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.176
CALLIE TORRES...
FROM SEATTLE GRACE?

27:27.176 --> 27:30.419
UH, I'M--DO I--
DO I KNOW YOU?

27:30.419 --> 27:32.381
NO. KENTON GILES.

27:32.381 --> 27:34.383
I'M AN ORTHO JUST LIKE YOU.
(elevator bell dings)

27:34.383 --> 27:35.725
OH.

27:35.725 --> 27:37.056
YEAH, I READ ALL ABOUT YOUR
CARTILAGE GENERATION WORK.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.058
IT'S INCREDIBLE. (laughs)
(laughs)

27:39.058 --> 27:40.730
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU STOPPED PRACTICING.

27:40.730 --> 27:42.661
SO YOU WORK FOR PEGASUS NOW?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.193
YEAH.

27:44.193 --> 27:46.135
YEAH, I GUESS I...
(clears throat)

27:46.135 --> 27:49.739
NEEDED A... (stammers) I NEEDED
TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE, SO...

27:49.739 --> 27:51.941
SHE PEAKED, YOU KNOW,
WITH THE CARTILAGE GENERATION.

27:51.941 --> 27:54.043
UH, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT'S BEST

27:54.043 --> 27:56.245
TO GET OUT BEFORE YOU DECLINE.
YEAH.

27:57.446 --> 27:58.447
(ding)

27:58.447 --> 28:00.179
(clears throat)

28:00.179 --> 28:02.181
AND AFTER THE ANESTHESIA
IS ADMINISTERED,

28:02.181 --> 28:04.083
BRIAN WILL BE READY
FOR SURGERY.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.414
AND WHEN EXACTLY

28:05.414 --> 28:07.717
ARE WE GONNA SEE
DOCTORS AVERY AND KAREV AGAIN?

28:07.717 --> 28:10.159
NO OFFENSE, BUT WE'RE HERE
TO TRAIL THEM, NOT YOU.

28:10.159 --> 28:11.320
(laughs)

28:11.320 --> 28:12.691
EDWARDS, NICE WORK.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.462
AH.
NO PROBLEM.

28:13.462 --> 28:14.994
WE'RE READY TO SCRUB IN.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.026
WILSON, COULD YOU SHOW
OUR FRIENDS UP TO THE GALLERY?

28:17.026 --> 28:18.367
YOU GUYS CAN WATCH
FROM UP THERE.
(Jo) MM-HMM.

28:18.367 --> 28:20.299
YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BLOOD
ON YOUR LEFT SHOULDER.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.431
EVERYONE, RIGHT THIS WAY.

28:22.431 --> 28:24.774
(Alex) HERE WE GO.

28:24.774 --> 28:26.776
(Alana) BY STREAMLINING
THE PROCESS,

28:26.776 --> 28:28.337
WE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE
THE HOSPITAL'S

HERNIA COMPLICATION RATE...
(speaks indistinctly)

28:29.739 --> 28:31.140

MEDICAL CENTER.

HOW MANY PATIENTS
WILL THIS PLACE

28:32.341 --> 28:33.783
ACCOMMODATE AT A TIME?

28:33.783 --> 28:35.314
UPWARDS OF 30...
(man and woman
speak indistinctly)

28:35.314 --> 28:37.146

UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.067
RIGHT. UH, YES.

I WAS GONNA TRY

THE FACE OF PORTLAND GEN,
