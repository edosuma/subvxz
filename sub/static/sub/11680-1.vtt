00:00.397 --> 00:01.834
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

00:02.003 --> 00:04.263
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.714 --> 00:06.835
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

00:07.698 --> 00:09.902
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

00:10.027 --> 00:12.209
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.855
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.980 --> 00:16.222
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.008 --> 00:19.124
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.531
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

00:23.167 --> 00:25.524
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

00:25.802 --> 00:28.402
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.571 --> 00:30.780
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

00:31.121 --> 00:33.199
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

00:33.368 --> 00:35.409
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

00:35.850 --> 00:38.037
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.423 --> 00:39.914
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:44.628 --> 00:46.462
Give us the man who killed
our operatives,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.548
and you and I can have
a little chat about your future.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.343
When Carla finds out you hid me,
your questions will be resolved

00:52.511 --> 00:55.175
- with headshot for both of us.
- What does it have to do with me?

00:55.300 --> 00:58.167
It's all a way to get to Mike.
Get your bag, we'll go.

00:58.917 --> 01:00.935
Crap.
We got to create a distraction.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.273
It's not a goodbye.
It's just in case.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.901
Management's on the way.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.655
Any story I tell them has to begin
with Victor's dead body.

01:14.368 --> 01:15.157
Finally.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.243
They get me alive,
they'll take me apart.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.011
Get out while you can.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.750
I want you people out of my life!

01:24.919 --> 01:27.329
All your old enemies,
did they just forget about you?

01:27.454 --> 01:30.923
Or has someone been keeping them at bay?
You want out?

01:31.092 --> 01:33.972
You've no idea
what hell will rain down

01:34.097 --> 01:36.095
if we stop watching out for you!

01:36.263 --> 01:37.722
I'll take my chances.

01:46.526 --> 01:47.834
<i>As an operative,</i>

01:47.959 --> 01:51.011
<i>you get used to being
in uncomfortable situations.</i>

01:51.136 --> 01:53.209
<i>Whether it's resisting interrogation</i>

01:53.334 --> 01:57.198
<i>in a foreign prison, fighting
guerilla forces in a tropical jungle,</i>

01:57.410 --> 02:00.911
<i>or swimming five miles to
Miami beach in your suit pants,</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:03.205
<i>it's just part of the job.</i>

02:04.882 --> 02:06.298
<i>What's harder to get used to</i>

02:06.423 --> 02:09.408
<i>is going into a situation
you don't know anything about.</i>

02:09.939 --> 02:11.930
<i>Just because you're exhausted
and disoriented</i>

02:12.055 --> 02:14.479
<i>doesn't mean you can stop
looking out for trouble.</i>

02:16.021 --> 02:18.008
<i>Danger isn't always obvious.</i>

02:18.181 --> 02:21.008
<i>It can be as subtle as a glance
from a friendly-seeming tourist,</i>

02:21.347 --> 02:23.275
<i>a car that slows down
at an odd time,</i>

02:23.672 --> 02:26.721
<i>or a cop that suddenly seems
a little too interested in you.</i>

02:26.920 --> 02:27.646
Sir.

02:30.449 --> 02:31.754
Get back here.

02:47.737 --> 02:50.085
I think he ran into the hotel.
Send all available units.

02:57.214 --> 02:59.491
<i>The backbone
of most hotel phone systems</i>

02:59.616 --> 03:02.639
<i>is secured by nothing more
than a door and a cheap lock...</i>

03:03.832 --> 03:05.596
<i>which makes them convenient
for people</i>

03:05.721 --> 03:08.270
<i>who need to make quick,
untraceable phone calls.</i>

03:26.833 --> 03:28.495
- <i>You're all right?</i>
- More or less.

03:28.620 --> 03:31.043
<i>Your helicopter ride was not
as long as I expected.</i>

03:31.402 --> 03:34.175
- How'd it go?
- It was interesting.

03:34.424 --> 03:36.183
It looks like the people
who burned me

03:36.308 --> 03:38.476
are gonna leave me alone
for now, anyway.

03:39.894 --> 03:41.746
Thanks for saving my life.

03:42.261 --> 03:44.557
It's always a treat to get you
out of trouble.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.016
I appreciate it.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.242
I checked the police radio
for news of our adventure.

03:49.450 --> 03:52.242
There was a call about a mystery man
washing up on the beach.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.608
A going-away present
from your helicopter friends?

03:54.972 --> 03:55.972
How bad?

03:56.471 --> 03:58.743
<i>You wouldn't happen to be
at the McAlpin hotel.</i>

03:59.108 --> 04:01.342
<i>The police think you're armed
and dangerous.</i>

04:01.873 --> 04:03.659
I'll have to find another way out.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.338
Now is not the time to blast
your way out of a building.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.890
<i>Talk to the cops now,
or get ready for a citywide manhunt.</i>

04:09.015 --> 04:10.442
Fine, can you call Sam,

04:10.567 --> 04:12.585
see what he can figure out
about my situation?

04:12.925 --> 04:13.925
Of course.

04:16.327 --> 04:17.454
And, Michael?

04:17.983 --> 04:19.300
<i>I'm glad you're alive.</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:21.172
Try to keep it that way.

04:30.089 --> 04:33.065
<i>Just because you can escape
from a situation</i>

04:33.324 --> 04:35.149
<i>doesn't mean you should.</i>

04:35.540 --> 04:37.330
<i>It's a risk/reward thing.</i>

04:37.455 --> 04:39.278
<i>Sometimes you have
to take your chances.</i>

04:39.599 --> 04:41.906
Down on your knees!
Hands behind your head!

04:42.279 --> 04:43.818
<i>Sometimes you have to remember</i>

04:43.943 --> 04:46.702
<i>it's easier to dodge questions
than bullets.</i>

04:50.290 --> 04:51.874
<i>Yogurt team</i>

05:07.235 --> 05:09.224
Thanks for coming, Sam.
What do we know?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.646
The bad news is
you're still as burned as ever.

05:13.816 --> 05:15.865
You're still the top of
the travel watch lists,

05:15.990 --> 05:17.881
and your assets are frozen
like popsicles.

05:18.006 --> 05:21.226
- And the good news?
- The good news is that,

05:21.528 --> 05:22.863
your status has changed.

05:23.147 --> 05:24.682
Whatever magic they were working

05:24.807 --> 05:27.159
to keep you out of the police
computers, they stopped.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.871
You're back on the radar
of foreign agencies, too.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.813
The good news is I'm being
investigated by the cops

05:33.938 --> 05:36.209
and the foreign
intelligence agencies.

05:36.334 --> 05:37.711
Yeah, it's a change.

05:37.836 --> 05:41.715
- It's progress... of a sort.
- Any luck getting me out of here?

05:41.883 --> 05:44.506
Until they charge you with something,
there's not much I can do.

05:44.631 --> 05:47.414
They're stalling. I guess somebody
hasn't been talking much.

05:47.539 --> 05:49.640
Memory loss.
You know how that is.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.347
The cops, they love that one.

05:51.472 --> 05:54.553
And, you know,
the whole,"no ID, no bank account"

05:54.678 --> 05:57.118
that's not helping.
So I had to be in touch with your mom,

05:57.243 --> 05:59.358
trying to dig up
a driver's license or something.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.522
- My mom, is she okay?
- Yeah.

06:02.093 --> 06:04.307
She's just a little upset
about the...

06:04.933 --> 06:07.783
You know, the house blowing up.
It's not the whole house.

06:08.152 --> 06:10.369
It's just the...
the sun-room.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.375
It came out okay,
but the bottom line

06:12.500 --> 06:15.040
is you're better off in here
until your ma cools off.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.751
Just sit tight, Mike.
Oh, one more thing...

06:17.919 --> 06:20.064
Your shades got delivered
to the loft,

06:20.405 --> 06:21.666
along with this.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.080
<i>As a spy,</i>

06:37.205 --> 06:39.865
<i>you expect to get locked up
from time to time.</i>

06:39.990 --> 06:42.009
<i>If you're on the job,
you just keep busy</i>

06:42.134 --> 06:44.209
<i>until someone
negotiates your release.</i>

06:44.334 --> 06:45.929
<i>If you're working alone,</i>

06:46.174 --> 06:49.349
<i>you may have to get used
to steel bars and baked beans.</i>

06:50.393 --> 06:51.980
All right, you, let's go.

06:53.261 --> 06:55.122
- Go where?
- You've been released.

06:55.505 --> 06:57.525
- Why? Has something changed?
- I don't know.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.163
You want me to check
to see if you can stick around?

07:07.934 --> 07:10.804
Now, where can I get myself
a pretty shirt like that?

07:11.918 --> 07:12.918
Harlan.

07:14.071 --> 07:16.299
- Harlan, what are you doing here?
- That's it?

07:16.424 --> 07:18.838
I haven't seen you since,
what, Lebanon, Bosnia?

07:18.963 --> 07:21.732
- Don't I get a, "Hey, old buddy"?
- Hey, old buddy.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.916
I heard through the grapevine
that you were in the clink,

07:28.041 --> 07:30.076
so I called Sam Axe
and offered my help.

07:30.432 --> 07:33.333
One of my security clients
is a big lawyer,

07:33.458 --> 07:36.346
and he accused them of holding you
as a political prisoner.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.441
I got a big laugh out of that one.

07:38.566 --> 07:41.126
- Michael Westen and Nelson Mandela.
- Thanks, Harlan.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.146
I just got you out of jail, bud.

07:44.393 --> 07:45.966
Don't I get some love here?

07:48.788 --> 07:49.888
Look at you.

07:50.601 --> 07:54.605
I track you down for ages, and suddenly,
you're popping out computer databases?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.485
Poof!
Right out of the blue.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.216
There's stuff on there about you
going rogue, selling secrets.

07:59.341 --> 08:02.205
Someone wanted to use me.
Make sure I'd no other options,

08:02.330 --> 08:05.024
they fabricated a bunch of stuff
and used it to burn me.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.854
Axe told me.
Anyway, I got my ass on down here.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.229
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

08:19.613 --> 08:22.858
Look who's here!
It's good to see you, Michael.

08:22.983 --> 08:25.084
- Mom.
- So glad you're not dead.

08:26.050 --> 08:28.507
I did a little remodeling with Sam.
You like it?

08:29.101 --> 08:31.718
- I'm so sorry, mom.
- Who's your friend?

08:32.056 --> 08:33.121
This is Harlan.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.347
We did some work together
in some other countries a while back.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.534
It's very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Westen.

08:38.982 --> 08:41.979
It's always nice to meet
Michael's mysterious acquaintances.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.945
- Mom, he's a friend.
- When we were in those other countries,

08:46.070 --> 08:48.463
Mike always used to say
how much he missed his mom.

08:48.588 --> 08:51.405
You're a bad liar, Harlan.
I like that about you. You want a beer?

08:52.134 --> 08:53.657
Sure. Sounds good.

08:53.938 --> 08:56.778
Sam and Fi are in the back,
drawing up plans to fix this mess.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.846
I imagine they could use some help.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.264
Harlan, tell me about yourself.
What do you do?

09:01.622 --> 09:03.167
You destroy houses, too?

09:03.520 --> 09:04.613
I'm telling you,

09:04.738 --> 09:07.805
It's harder rebuilding a sun-room
than blowing the damn thing up.

09:08.149 --> 09:11.085
You have no one to blame but yourself.
If you blow something up correctly,

09:11.210 --> 09:13.076
you have nothing left to fix.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.905
- Look who came home from jail.
- It's nice to be home.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.959
Hey, I hate to rain on the whole
homecoming-lovey thing,

09:21.084 --> 09:22.325
but we got problems.

09:22.450 --> 09:25.516
Carla's people were the only thing
keeping the cops off our backs,

09:25.853 --> 09:27.748
Not to mention
12 countries' worth of guys

09:27.873 --> 09:29.809
who are looking to put
a bullet in you.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.508
Third-degree burns prevent acne.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.725
It doesn't mean you set
your head on fire.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.280
The point is, we got
a whole new set of worries.

09:36.405 --> 09:37.951
We need all the help we can get.

09:38.654 --> 09:41.417
- I was talking to Harlan earlier and...
- You talking about the gig?

09:41.542 --> 09:42.542
The gig?

09:43.239 --> 09:45.167
- You told him?
- I was about to.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.331
We're helping a girl that he met.
Pays top dollar.

09:48.456 --> 09:50.363
Axe volunteered you and Fi for duty.

09:50.488 --> 09:52.741
Sorry, didn't mean to just
spring this on you.

09:52.866 --> 09:54.509
No worries.
He does this for fun.

09:59.635 --> 10:03.227
2 weeks ago, some men came to
my family's farm and told us to move.

10:03.491 --> 10:05.773
They said that it belonged
to an American company now.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.065
I was doing security
for a company down there.

10:08.395 --> 10:10.676
These corporations are bribing
officials down south

10:10.801 --> 10:12.871
to steal land,
and it's all run in Miami.

10:12.996 --> 10:15.441
They paid a judge
to put my father in prison.

10:15.679 --> 10:17.733
It's only a matter of time
before he dies.

10:17.858 --> 10:19.089
I checked it out.

10:19.214 --> 10:21.518
The guy who runs the scam
is Rufino Cortez.

10:21.643 --> 10:24.289
He's wanted in Venezuela
as part of a corruption probe.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.376
He'll spook if they try to extradite
him, we gotta grab him off the books.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.754
He goes down,
we take a few corrupt judges with him.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.450
Sunshine's a great disinfectant.

10:31.575 --> 10:33.909
If we do this,
it's not just for Marta's family.

10:34.034 --> 10:37.168
Rufino's been going after
all kinds of folks down there.

10:38.897 --> 10:42.401
Marta, let's go get something to drink.
Ever had a mango mojito?

10:46.214 --> 10:47.479
What's going on?

10:48.058 --> 10:50.009
And don't tell me it was coincidence

10:50.134 --> 10:51.642
that you bailed me out of jail

10:51.767 --> 10:54.042
and then you just happen
to have a job for me.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.167
No, I...

10:59.820 --> 11:01.566
Listen, I'm sorry.
It's just...

11:02.183 --> 11:04.352
I've been seeing her,
when I heard this thing,

11:04.477 --> 11:06.172
you needing help, I figured that I'd

11:06.297 --> 11:09.090
- Kill two birds with one stone.
- This Rufino,

11:09.467 --> 11:10.467
he's evil.

11:10.810 --> 11:13.247
He's had people come after him,
so he's guarded like the Pope.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.840
But I think I've got an angle.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.883
- I need some help.
- My help?

11:17.138 --> 11:20.095
You always were the smart one,
and I was the pretty one, right?

11:21.967 --> 11:24.810
Listen, I looked her in the eye,
and I told her I would help.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.335
Please, Mike.

11:27.265 --> 11:28.695
I'll see what I can do.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.808
When I scouted this place,

11:55.933 --> 11:57.937
I thought,
"Michael's gonna love this".

11:58.202 --> 12:00.344
- Get to play dress-up.
- What's your plan?

12:00.691 --> 12:03.442
This is Rufino's club.
He's here every night.

12:03.749 --> 12:05.832
I figured we'd have a better time
separating him

12:05.957 --> 12:08.404
from his security team
in here than outside.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.783
Is that what you figured?

12:11.135 --> 12:12.814
He's back there. Private booth.

12:13.183 --> 12:15.025
You know, he's the boss.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.027
I forget how they say it in spanish.

12:24.441 --> 12:25.810
He's a real charmer.

12:27.123 --> 12:29.289
That scumbag next to him is Falcone,

12:29.414 --> 12:31.333
Rufino's main man here in Miami.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.168
You see, the guy almost always
has a security detail,

12:34.293 --> 12:36.009
even taking a leak.

12:36.134 --> 12:37.210
Almost always?

12:37.335 --> 12:40.847
Except for when he takes his nightly
skirt to the back. Private room.

12:40.972 --> 12:44.775
<i>In the highest security places,
uniforms are for show.</i>

12:44.900 --> 12:47.210
<i>The real security
doesn't announce itself</i>

12:47.335 --> 12:50.686
<i>with anything but wary looks
and shirts loose enough to hide a gun.</i>

12:50.811 --> 12:51.839
Come on.

12:57.518 --> 13:01.206
The old perv does his thing in there,
that door there goes out to the alley.

13:01.331 --> 13:03.909
We just grab Rufino
and hustle him out.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.942
I conned a key from
the storage company.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.412
You'd have been proud of me.
Classic Mike Westen.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.693
- Harlan, hold on.
- Now we just hang tight.

13:11.818 --> 13:15.206
You think a guy like Rufino would allow
the most sensitive part of his club

13:15.331 --> 13:17.838
- to be beaten with a storage key?
- What else do we need?

13:19.537 --> 13:21.091
How about the alarm's code?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.472
Break that. I need a pry bar.

13:28.898 --> 13:31.287
<i>Security devices
are generally one-way.</i>

13:31.412 --> 13:33.285
<i>They keep people in,
or keep them out.</i>

13:33.410 --> 13:35.023
<i>Most high-security locks</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:37.761
<i>are a lot less secure
if you come at them backwards.</i>

13:38.443 --> 13:41.603
- What are you doing? Open up!
- Just like old times.

13:42.036 --> 13:44.271
- Just like old times.
- Open this door!

13:55.999 --> 13:56.999
My God!

13:57.124 --> 13:59.713
- Men with guns? Are you alright?
- It was fine.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.674
- It's gonna take longer to grab Rufino.
- How much longer?

14:03.008 --> 14:06.180
- My father's not well. We can't do...
- We're working on it, okay?

14:06.305 --> 14:08.448
We're just gonna use
a different plan next time.

14:09.545 --> 14:12.851
Yeah, can you give us a minute, babe?
I need to talk with Mike.

14:14.065 --> 14:17.147
Hey, I got careless, man. I'm sorry.
You know, it just...

14:17.315 --> 14:19.965
- It seemed like it was the right play.
- It's all right.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.270
No, you know, it's like
how you always used to say.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.795
Don't get personally involved.
But...

14:25.407 --> 14:27.970
I'm involved.
And I got sloppy.

14:28.095 --> 14:30.923
Kind of proves my point, though.
I needed your help, right?

14:31.048 --> 14:32.078
Anytime, Harlan.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.250
So what happened to you, man?
You just disappeared for all that time.

14:36.755 --> 14:38.896
Whoever burned me
wanted me out of sight,

14:39.021 --> 14:40.973
they were powerful enough
to make it happen.

14:41.098 --> 14:43.548
Now you're just a burned spy
tossed out into the cold, huh?

14:43.875 --> 14:46.440
Might as well tattoo
a bull's-eye on your forehead.

14:46.565 --> 14:48.230
That's one way of looking at it.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.855
Well, now you're helping me
with Marta.

14:50.980 --> 14:51.980
Listen.

14:52.405 --> 14:55.769
No matter what happens from here on out,
I got your back, brother.

14:56.165 --> 14:58.665
Thanks, Harlan.
And I'll do the planning next time.

14:59.845 --> 15:00.895
You got it.

15:04.095 --> 15:06.065
Hey. Sam. Feeling thirsty?

15:07.055 --> 15:09.360
Rufino Cortez? Are you serious?

15:09.485 --> 15:12.785
You want to grab Rufino Cortez?

15:13.555 --> 15:15.080
I'm gonna need another mojito.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.249
Have as many as you want.
Just tell me about him.

15:17.475 --> 15:20.840
He's a bagman for this land-grab thing
down in Venezuela.

15:20.965 --> 15:23.880
It's a lot of money, a lot of guns.
Not my style.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.411
I'm more of your
"friendly neighborhood

15:26.536 --> 15:28.526
hide your cash from the tax man"
kind of guy.

15:28.651 --> 15:29.511
And Rufino?

15:29.735 --> 15:33.005
Rufino is a "rob and kill for hire

15:33.130 --> 15:34.933
and call it an investment"
kind of guy.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.716
We need you
to put together a package,

15:36.841 --> 15:39.311
make Mike look like somebody
Rufino would want to talk to...

15:39.436 --> 15:40.981
Business records, bank accounts.

15:43.715 --> 15:47.487
Just promise me you'll have Rufino
out of Miami before tax season.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.081
Can do.

15:54.495 --> 15:58.499
You know, when your father was alive,
he used to do all the repairs himself.

15:58.635 --> 16:00.827
Yeah, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

16:00.952 --> 16:03.295
The walls were made
with four different kinds of lumber.

16:04.217 --> 16:06.517
Frank used to just go out
and find stuff.

16:06.642 --> 16:10.330
I wouldn't call tearing wiring out
of your neighbor's air conditioner

16:10.455 --> 16:11.455
"finding".

16:12.305 --> 16:13.615
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, look!

16:13.740 --> 16:15.930
There's the guy
who blew up my house!

16:16.055 --> 16:18.518
Nice to see you're having
such a sunshiny day, Sam.

16:18.805 --> 16:21.396
- Sam, whose car is that? The buick?
- Maddy's neighbor.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.525
I took it over there to drop it off,
and, well, we got a little friendly.

16:25.857 --> 16:27.652
So she's letting me
hang on to the car.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.220
Mrs. Reynolds? You're romancing
an 80-year-old woman for a car?

16:31.345 --> 16:33.365
I'm talking about her daughter,
Miss Reynolds.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.076
She's 39, going on 22.

16:35.305 --> 16:36.580
Great lady. Great car.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.570
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Good. Mikey's all set.

16:39.695 --> 16:42.160
He's got a meeting with Rufino's guy,
Falcone, later today.

16:42.285 --> 16:43.710
Awesome! That's great.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.170
Mike, your new cover ID.

16:46.115 --> 16:47.839
You're Tom Wellington, esquire.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.091
Lawyer for a shady
international investment group.

16:51.349 --> 16:53.785
Hey, you wanna pick the names,
you gotta go to the meeting,

16:53.910 --> 16:56.415
and listen to Barry talk
about his skin-care regimen.

17:01.335 --> 17:04.520
<i>High-status cover Ids
are rarely effective.</i>

17:04.645 --> 17:07.380
<i>Claim to be a big shot,
and people get suspicious.</i>

17:07.505 --> 17:11.355
<i>Claim to be a big shot's errand boy,
people don't think twice.</i>

17:12.435 --> 17:14.960
<i>Act like you don't want to be there
because you're tired,</i>

17:15.085 --> 17:17.430
<i>you're underappreciated,
or you're sick,</i>

17:17.555 --> 17:20.055
<i>and people tend
to trust you even more.</i>

17:21.775 --> 17:22.875
Mr. Falcone.

17:23.115 --> 17:25.335
- Mr. Wellington.
- Thank you for coming.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.502
Word is...

17:27.045 --> 17:31.257
If I wanted a meeting with Mr. Cortez,
you are the man to talk to.

17:31.535 --> 17:34.335
I am, indeed. You can think of me
as the gatekeeper.

17:38.435 --> 17:41.535
Now, I had a look
at your proposal, Mr. Wellington.

17:42.415 --> 17:43.687
Very attractive.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.125
Tell me, why is it
that your investors

17:46.250 --> 17:48.650
are so interested in land
in South America?

17:49.340 --> 17:51.100
Listen, I'm just a lawyer
on the deal.

17:51.225 --> 17:53.950
My job is to set up a meeting
with Cortez and my clients.

17:54.075 --> 17:57.367
These clients of yours...
Tell me a little more about them.

17:57.915 --> 18:00.580
They're people who want
to meet with Mr. Cortez.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.225
People with security concerns.
That's all I can say.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.630
I'll wait for your call.

18:04.755 --> 18:06.044
I don't mean to be rude,

18:06.169 --> 18:09.129
but, you know, Mr. Cortez
has security concerns of his own.

18:09.297 --> 18:13.258
I'm just here to set up the meeting.
I have attorney-client privileges.

18:14.455 --> 18:16.155
I understand and respect

18:16.795 --> 18:19.328
the importance you attach
to your professional ethics,

18:19.453 --> 18:22.232
but, you see, in my profession,
we have our own code,

18:22.357 --> 18:24.790
a code that compels me
to break your arm

18:24.915 --> 18:27.365
if you don't answer my question.
Do you understand?

18:28.595 --> 18:30.645
I don't know their names, okay?

18:31.175 --> 18:35.179
They chose me because I had
no connection to them, all right?

18:35.885 --> 18:36.885
I see.

18:37.545 --> 18:39.570
Now, Mr. Wellington,

18:39.695 --> 18:43.595
sometimes people try and steal from us,
or they talk to the police.

18:43.895 --> 18:47.270
Do you wanna know what happens to them?
Does that interest you at all?

18:47.395 --> 18:49.753
Nope. No, I just want
to make the deal, okay, man?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.087
Would you...

18:53.507 --> 18:55.207
Please let go of my arm.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.385
Please.

19:00.675 --> 19:03.175
Well, I think
we understand each other.

19:03.755 --> 19:07.020
Be at the train yard in Kendall
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

19:24.870 --> 19:25.870
<i>Like a wedding,</i>

19:25.995 --> 19:28.900
<i>an armed extraction
requires a lot of planning,</i>

19:29.025 --> 19:30.640
<i>if you want it to go well.</i>

19:30.765 --> 19:33.797
<i>And like a wedding, it's not
the sort of thing you want to do twice,</i>

19:34.055 --> 19:36.549
<i>which is why you hold
a rehearsal before the big day.</i>

19:40.635 --> 19:43.140
Seriously, Michael, you just let him
dislocate your shoulder?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.790
It was either that
or lose my cover ID.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.685
Couldn't you have just, you know,
accidentally snapped his neck?

19:48.810 --> 19:50.410
Make it look innocent?

19:51.065 --> 19:53.233
I like her style.
You should listen to her more.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.652
Thank you, Harlan.
It's nice to be appreciated.

19:56.175 --> 19:57.675
Okay, let's do this.

19:58.025 --> 19:59.716
This guy knows what he's doing.

19:59.841 --> 20:01.991
I couldn't have picked
a better location myself.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.410
They'll come in from over there.
It's the best visibility.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.048
I think our only play
is to create a distraction over there.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.193
How distracting?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.610
More than a firecracker,
less than a neutron bomb.

20:10.735 --> 20:11.735
Anyway....

20:12.295 --> 20:13.670
They'll fall back to there.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.430
We go in heavy as a son of a bitch
and shoot their car to pieces.

20:16.555 --> 20:20.426
His security holds us off so the Vips
can escape behind those containers.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.244
Where I'll handle Falcone
and grab Rufino.

20:23.458 --> 20:24.639
What could be easier?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.329
Easy on the explosives, Fi.

20:32.495 --> 20:35.500
We're trying to nail this guy
on corruption charges.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.650
It could be tough
if he's in little pieces.

20:37.775 --> 20:39.425
It'll save on shipping.

20:41.165 --> 20:42.165
Fine.

20:43.985 --> 20:47.585
What do you think Michael's gonna do,
now that he's just a...

20:48.325 --> 20:49.575
Miami resident?

20:50.435 --> 20:53.535
Well, he's still burned,
and he's still Mike, so...

20:53.875 --> 20:56.588
- I wouldn't say he's a Miami resident.
- You know what I mean.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.215
You think he's ready to leave it behind
and just live?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.723
I think it's a little tricky.
Can you help me with this?

21:01.848 --> 21:03.598
Answer the question, Sam.

21:05.315 --> 21:07.307
I think he'll try and get back in.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.575
Why? When he's got so much here?

21:10.534 --> 21:12.384
He might be able
to make money, finally.

21:12.509 --> 21:14.647
And look at Harlan.
He might be getting friends.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.965
He did his government work,
as you call it, for a reason.

21:19.185 --> 21:20.403
For what? His country?

21:20.571 --> 21:23.099
What have they done for him lately,
other than betray him,

21:23.224 --> 21:24.824
leave him for dead, ruin his life?

21:25.325 --> 21:28.077
The fact that you have to ask
means you're never gonna get it, Fi.

21:32.295 --> 21:34.450
Hey, sister, don't be throwing
explosives at me

21:34.575 --> 21:36.961
just 'cause you can't take
the cold, hard truth!

21:45.665 --> 21:47.356
<i>Any ambush depends on knowing</i>

21:47.481 --> 21:49.831
<i>where your target
is going to be and when.</i>

21:49.956 --> 21:52.265
<i>Unfortunately, there are times
when the only way to put</i>

21:52.390 --> 21:55.647
<i>your target in the line of fire
is to be there yourself.</i>

21:56.745 --> 21:59.025
- You see anything, Hercules?
- Nothing yet, boss.

21:59.955 --> 22:02.654
<i>Those are the times you just have
to trust your team,</i>

22:02.851 --> 22:04.238
<i>and hope everything goes right.</i>

22:20.425 --> 22:21.839
Where's Mr. Cortez?

22:22.225 --> 22:24.345
Unfortunately,
he couldn't be with us today.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.135
I'm authorized to discuss any terms.

22:26.618 --> 22:27.460
What?

22:27.585 --> 22:29.389
We agreed Mr. Cortez would be...

22:29.625 --> 22:33.125
I find it best to keep
agreements flexible, Mr. Wellington.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.581
Where is Rufino?

22:34.706 --> 22:37.906
My job is to meet
with Mr. Cortez, not you.

22:38.255 --> 22:41.090
If he finds out that my clients
are doing a deal with someone else,

22:41.215 --> 22:42.415
it's your ass.

22:43.718 --> 22:46.698
Yeah, just pull the arm out again.
Feels good.

22:46.995 --> 22:49.867
I don't get to go back to my client

22:50.035 --> 22:52.787
without anything short
of a meeting with Rufino.

22:54.865 --> 22:57.208
I said you can discuss this with me.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.753
And I said I can do it with Rufino.
You don't like it, shoot me.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.471
- Let's go in.
- No.

23:02.705 --> 23:05.049
Fi starts the show when she sees Rufino.
We move then.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.640
Why are you waving me off?

23:16.295 --> 23:18.495
Is this supposed to scare me?

23:19.375 --> 23:20.925
Is that what this is?

23:21.355 --> 23:25.055
Let me be clear. You can shoot at me
as many times as you want,

23:25.645 --> 23:28.375
but unless I get a face-to-face
meeting with Rufino,

23:28.500 --> 23:32.410
I cannot give you what you want!

23:32.578 --> 23:34.537
You're a determined man,
Mr. Wellington.

23:36.345 --> 23:37.816
I'll tell you what...

23:37.941 --> 23:40.251
I'll call you with a place and time.
We'll pick you up.

23:40.565 --> 23:42.503
You'll meet Mr. Cortez in the car.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.465
If he likes what you have to say,
we'll see about this deal.

23:45.633 --> 23:46.424
If not...

24:00.875 --> 24:03.825
And I meet with Mr. Cortez
on the way.

24:04.775 --> 24:05.775
I'll be there.

24:05.900 --> 24:09.800
Now, I assume I'll be meeting
with the actual Mr. Cortez this time.

24:18.575 --> 24:20.075
That's a nice combo.

24:20.605 --> 24:22.355
What? It's good this way.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.180
- You get the pickup location, Mikey?
- Train tracks on 10th Street.

24:26.305 --> 24:29.125
Looks like the meeting is gonna be
on the move so no one can hit it.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.100
Have to hit it on the move, then.

24:31.925 --> 24:35.475
<i>Security levels vary widely
for different kinds of vehicles.</i>

24:35.635 --> 24:38.385
So, do you guys do
this sort of thing a lot?

24:40.275 --> 24:41.625
More than most...

24:42.665 --> 24:43.665
I suppose.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.470
<i>Garbage trucks, for example,
are expensive,</i>

24:46.595 --> 24:49.400
<i>but the fact that they're hard to hide
and harder to sell</i>

24:49.525 --> 24:52.866
<i>means that you don't find a lot
of garbage-truck alarm systems.</i>

24:52.991 --> 24:54.921
How long did you and Michael
work together?

24:55.046 --> 24:56.046
About a year.

24:56.171 --> 24:59.130
You know, he's a pretty damn good guy
to have around when things get rough.

24:59.255 --> 25:01.005
Yeah. He has his moments.

25:03.615 --> 25:06.762
Listen, thanks for helping out
with this, seriously.

25:08.135 --> 25:09.835
You want to pay me back?

25:10.645 --> 25:13.616
Take Michael for a beer.
Tell him life is worth living

25:13.741 --> 25:16.841
when you're not sneaking around
for the government.

25:17.025 --> 25:18.025
Will do.

25:30.485 --> 25:31.485
Go.

25:35.915 --> 25:38.915
So, I'm thinking,
they're gonna follow the tracks,

25:39.497 --> 25:40.997
Make sure nobody's after them.

25:41.494 --> 25:43.627
When they get to dollars to doughnuts,
they turn around,

25:43.752 --> 25:46.470
come back down this way
to drop you off when they're done.

25:46.595 --> 25:49.046
And we hit them right there.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.298
Sounds good, Sam.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.557
Harlan's got some Venezuelan
commando types coming to take Rufino.

25:54.682 --> 25:56.082
So I poked around.

25:56.395 --> 25:59.470
Sounds like these guys are frothing
at the mouth to get this guy down there.

25:59.595 --> 26:02.268
Murder, corruption, conspiracy.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.065
Nice leather briefcase.
Shame to ruin it.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.006
Guess it's for a good cause.

26:09.155 --> 26:12.570
<i>In close spaces, a knife's often
more effective than a gun.</i>

26:15.145 --> 26:17.158
<i>Easier to handle, easier to hide,</i>

26:17.425 --> 26:19.869
<i>and in the right hands, scarier.</i>

26:27.211 --> 26:29.792
When you asked to borrow
your father's old briefcase,

26:29.917 --> 26:32.890
you didn't mention you were
planning on stabbing someone.

26:33.015 --> 26:35.760
- This is more of a "just in case".
- In case what?

26:36.155 --> 26:39.255
I'm gonna get a beer.
A fresh one, from the garage.

26:40.895 --> 26:41.895
Mom...

26:42.115 --> 26:44.500
- Forget it. I don't wanna know.
- It's probably better.

26:44.625 --> 26:47.104
I do wanna know if you've given
any thought at all

26:47.735 --> 26:50.109
to what you might be getting
your friend Harlan into.

26:50.259 --> 26:52.443
He's nice, but he's not exactly
a rocket scientist.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.761
Hanging out with you
isn't the safest thing to do.

26:54.886 --> 26:57.031
- Mom, he's special forces.
- Whatever.

26:57.715 --> 27:00.819
He's got a lot to prove with you.
It's written all over his face.

27:00.944 --> 27:01.994
That's dangerous.

27:02.201 --> 27:03.704
You know, he's your friend,

27:03.872 --> 27:06.749
but if something happens to him,
I'm just warning you.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.590
Are you through here?

27:10.779 --> 27:12.257
I've one more thing to do.

27:22.555 --> 27:25.145
<i>The rolling meeting
is a popular security measure</i>

27:25.270 --> 27:26.878
<i>among high-end criminals.</i>

27:27.675 --> 27:29.780
<i>It's hard for law enforcement
to bug,</i>

27:29.905 --> 27:32.710
<i>and it's a lot easier
to detect any surveillance.</i>

27:32.835 --> 27:35.611
<i>Do it in an armored car
with an armed team,</i>

27:36.055 --> 27:39.655
<i>it's not just a secure place,
it's a fortress on wheels.</i>

27:39.780 --> 27:41.575
I love these SUVs. They're roomy.

27:42.735 --> 27:44.820
<i>If you're going to take on
that fortress,</i>

27:44.945 --> 27:46.789
<i>you'd better have an army.</i>

27:54.855 --> 27:57.133
Mr. Wellington, meet Mr. Cortez.

27:57.785 --> 28:00.720
It's an honor to get a meeting
with someone so shy.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.265
Let's focus on the matter at hand.

28:06.217 --> 28:09.729
Your clients want to buy a lot of land
in my country, Mr. Wellington.

28:10.447 --> 28:13.232
Coffee plantations,
soybeans, corn...

28:13.651 --> 28:16.971
- These are men of great appetite.
- I just do the paperwork.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.572
I ask myself,
"Who needs so much land?"

28:20.279 --> 28:22.567
Farm importers dodging taxes?

28:22.692 --> 28:24.472
Chemical companies dumping waste?

28:24.597 --> 28:25.647
Or perhaps,

28:26.477 --> 28:28.372
an american law-enforcement agency?

28:28.755 --> 28:31.125
You think I'm a cop?
You're joking!

28:32.071 --> 28:35.181
You think I'm wearing a wire?
You wanna check? Look. Nothing there.

28:35.306 --> 28:37.548
- Nothing there. You wanna see this?
- That's enough!

28:38.584 --> 28:40.051
Can we do this, please?

28:45.046 --> 28:48.017
A deal like is...
means many enemies.

28:48.630 --> 28:50.394
There will be officials to bribe,

28:50.604 --> 28:51.604
judges...

28:51.772 --> 28:53.469
Lives... will end.

28:53.768 --> 28:56.448
Tell me why I should do
a deal with ghosts

28:56.573 --> 28:59.612
who hide behind numbered
bank accounts and lawyers?

29:00.382 --> 29:02.448
I don't like this.
Stop the car.

29:02.616 --> 29:03.866
Wait a second, here.

29:06.604 --> 29:07.661
What the hell?

29:08.118 --> 29:11.123
Come on, Mikey.
Something's wrong. They stopped.

29:11.399 --> 29:13.759
Do you think that I don't want
to tell you?

29:13.884 --> 29:15.294
Get out. You're done.

29:15.696 --> 29:19.131
<i>When an operation depends on
clockwork timing and position,</i>

29:19.646 --> 29:22.635
<i>you have to do whatever it takes
to make sure it comes together.</i>

29:22.803 --> 29:26.223
I can't go back empty-handed. Please.
You don't know who I'm dealing with.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.682
These guys are serious.
It's a billion dollars.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.811
The way these people work,
if I don't close the deal,

29:31.979 --> 29:35.356
they'll put a bullet back of my head,
and they'll find another guy to do it.

29:35.639 --> 29:37.344
I cannot go back to these guys

29:37.469 --> 29:40.519
and say, "Sorry, men,
the deal didn't go through".

29:42.698 --> 29:44.031
Just hear me out, please.

29:50.293 --> 29:51.293
Fine.

29:52.461 --> 29:53.666
Tell me more.

30:00.418 --> 30:02.716
Okay, we're back in business.
You guys ready to go?

30:03.177 --> 30:05.386
- Do you have to ask?
- Ready, ready.

30:09.023 --> 30:10.307
And... Fiona.

30:16.605 --> 30:19.316
<i>The principles behind a snatch-and-grab
are straightforward,</i>

30:20.730 --> 30:23.028
<i>Separate the target from security,</i>

30:23.196 --> 30:26.629
<i>then keep the security occupied
while the target is acquired.</i>

30:26.754 --> 30:30.314
<i>Simple enough, but like anything,
it's all in the execution.</i>

30:55.937 --> 30:57.698
- What the hell?
- Get down!

31:09.618 --> 31:13.204
<i>There's a reason it's called
bullet-resistant glass, not bulletproof.</i>

31:14.080 --> 31:16.466
<i>The right bullet will take out
any glass.</i>

31:19.807 --> 31:22.755
Put the gun down.
Gun down, gun down!

31:24.925 --> 31:27.551
You've a slug in your engine block,
your team is pinned down,

31:27.719 --> 31:29.178
and I'm leaving with your boss.

31:30.367 --> 31:34.058
If I were you, I'd think about another
line of work other than security.

31:42.783 --> 31:43.901
Nice work, Jefe!

31:54.597 --> 31:57.270
That was a beautiful thing, Mike.
Just like the old days, buddy.

31:57.395 --> 32:00.388
It'll be a beautiful thing when we get
Rufino on a boat to Venezuela.

32:00.513 --> 32:03.216
Everything's taken care of.
The team's gonna pick him up at dawn.

32:03.341 --> 32:04.838
Man, I'm sorry.

32:05.155 --> 32:07.758
I forgot to tell you.
There's one change in the plan.

32:11.543 --> 32:13.222
They're not coming for Rufino.

32:15.157 --> 32:16.661
They're coming for you.

32:20.348 --> 32:22.048
It's Sam, again.

32:22.858 --> 32:26.712
It's been a while. We're just worried
about you. Call me when you get this.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.562
Think we should order him
another couple of drinks?

32:30.687 --> 32:33.433
You've ordered four beers
and two coffees. You stop ordering,

32:33.558 --> 32:35.847
when someone doesn't show up
after three hours.

32:36.006 --> 32:38.914
Right, but he was so specific.
We ditch the truck,

32:39.082 --> 32:41.071
they ship off Rufino,
we meet them here.

32:41.257 --> 32:45.129
- They should have at least checked in.
- How well did you know Harlan?

32:46.810 --> 32:48.841
I don't know.
We did four or five missions.

32:50.029 --> 32:51.589
Always had your back.

32:52.830 --> 32:55.767
- You think?
- I think sometimes people change.

33:02.773 --> 33:05.858
Jesus, what a beautiful night.
Smell that ocean air.

33:06.177 --> 33:08.360
You sure this is
the smart play here, Harlan?

33:09.029 --> 33:12.489
- Don't you talk to me about smart play.
- How long have we known each other?

33:12.657 --> 33:14.992
Not long enough for you
to show me a little respect.

33:15.376 --> 33:19.067
Is this how you get respect?
You betray a friend and kill a man?

33:19.839 --> 33:22.717
As a matter of fact, yes.
I spent a lot of time

33:22.842 --> 33:25.753
carrying the bags, kicking down doors,
getting the guns ready.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.285
I need a change.

33:34.151 --> 33:36.401
Please don't do this.
You're making a mistake.

33:36.526 --> 33:39.949
I disagree. I got to say,
I'm pretty proud of this.

33:41.029 --> 33:43.687
Rufino's partners back home
are getting a little nervous

33:43.855 --> 33:45.818
about this anti-corruption thing.

33:46.046 --> 33:49.067
They knew the federales want to bag him,
start a big probe,

33:49.192 --> 33:52.787
so they asked me for help.
Yeah, they asked me.

33:53.569 --> 33:57.451
I went the white knight with Marta,
and I got myself the gig to grab.

33:57.619 --> 34:01.141
And when you showed up on the radar,
it was perfect.

34:03.085 --> 34:05.778
I get someone to help me out
with the old man.

34:06.289 --> 34:08.253
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- No problem.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.994
Of course, we needed somebody
to blame for smoking Rufino.

34:11.119 --> 34:13.496
I'm gonna give the federales
Mike Westen.

34:13.871 --> 34:16.469
The dirty spy who denied them
their chance for justice.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.972
You were the cherry on top
of the whole thing.

34:19.268 --> 34:21.201
- And Marta?
- Marta...

34:22.534 --> 34:24.721
Rufino stole every farm
within 50 miles.

34:24.846 --> 34:27.815
It's not too hard to find
some desperate chica who needed my help.

34:29.523 --> 34:31.158
She's very grateful.

34:32.112 --> 34:35.001
You should think about that while
you stand in front of the firing squad.

34:35.126 --> 34:36.886
It might help you feel better.

34:37.011 --> 34:39.409
You know,
Fiona wanted me to talk to you.

34:39.793 --> 34:42.913
She wanted me to tell you that there's
a life after you're done being a spy.

34:43.244 --> 34:45.165
Not very long, in your case.

34:46.576 --> 34:47.376
Listen.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.782
How do you know you can trust
Rufino's partners?

34:49.907 --> 34:52.800
What's stopping them from turning on you
the way they turned on him?

34:52.925 --> 34:55.259
Man, don't you dare patronize me!

34:55.657 --> 34:58.971
I'm not patronizing you.
You won, you beat me.

34:59.319 --> 35:02.670
You're smarter than me.
I'm just asking you to think about it.

35:03.410 --> 35:05.769
You're better than this.
I know you.

35:05.997 --> 35:07.981
You're a patriot.
We served together.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.841
You sure this is who you wanna be,

35:09.966 --> 35:13.110
a mercenary, betraying his friend
for blood money?

35:17.932 --> 35:20.576
- I'm sure.
- That's all I needed to know.

35:32.229 --> 35:35.200
Pretty clever, Mike!
But I still can kick your ass!

36:25.261 --> 36:28.744
<i>When you're trying to hide in the water,
fire is your friend.</i>

36:28.869 --> 36:31.799
<i>The light turns the surface
of the water into a mirror.</i>

36:31.924 --> 36:34.400
<i>Then it's just a matter of finding
a place to surface</i>

36:34.525 --> 36:36.944
<i>where the fire isn't consuming
all the oxygen.</i>

37:07.904 --> 37:09.754
You think you're gonna run,

37:10.445 --> 37:12.145
make it out to the road?

37:14.203 --> 37:15.800
Give it a shot, buddy.

37:31.618 --> 37:32.860
Come on, Mike.

37:34.277 --> 37:35.466
Let's do this.

37:36.933 --> 37:38.463
Just you and me.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.022
Right now, man to man, buddy.

37:43.147 --> 37:45.727
<i>One of the things covert
operatives have to give up</i>

37:45.852 --> 37:48.169
<i>is the idea of a fair fight.</i>

37:50.092 --> 37:52.586
<i>Spies aren't trained to fight fair.</i>

37:52.711 --> 37:54.813
<i>Spies are trained to win.</i>

38:05.426 --> 38:06.533
I'm sorry.

38:43.737 --> 38:45.322
Yes.
Who is this?

38:46.825 --> 38:48.268
The man on the docks there,

38:48.710 --> 38:51.119
<i>the one who you wanted to get
Rufino Cortez for you,</i>

38:51.287 --> 38:53.067
<i>he works with Rufino's partners.</i>

38:53.444 --> 38:55.749
They wanted to make sure
he was dead before the trial.

38:55.925 --> 38:59.110
<i>You want to put someone on trial,
Harlan's the best you're gonna do.</i>

39:20.116 --> 39:21.985
Mike, this is not good.

39:22.413 --> 39:25.210
You've been swimming away from bad guys
a little too often these days.

39:25.335 --> 39:26.335
I know.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.629
I'm not saying you're not popular,

39:28.754 --> 39:32.202
but you're a guy who's had
a lot of disagreements over the years.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.098
- You can't even trust your buddies.
- It's nothing we can't handle.

39:35.223 --> 39:37.050
Michael, you really need stitches.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.496
I'm fine. The cuts are shallow.

39:40.109 --> 39:41.920
I know. I made them.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.506
You know, I never liked that Harlan.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.293
Do you remember? I told you...

39:46.418 --> 39:49.011
You told me I was going
to get him killed.

39:49.316 --> 39:51.712
No, you misunderstood.
That's not what I meant.

39:51.837 --> 39:54.182
It doesn't matter.
The point is...

39:55.053 --> 39:57.686
You three...
need to stick together.

40:12.036 --> 40:15.964
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Yes. I'm going home tonight.

40:16.687 --> 40:19.338
The newspapers are already saying
that the land will be returned.

40:19.463 --> 40:21.418
My father will be released
from prison soon.

40:21.896 --> 40:23.549
That's good. I'm glad.

40:23.674 --> 40:26.224
Sorry about Harlan.
He seemed so nice...

40:27.667 --> 40:28.892
Like a good man.

40:29.017 --> 40:31.406
He was a good man... once.

40:31.901 --> 40:34.796
- I didn't mean to bring you to trouble.
- It's not your fault.

40:34.921 --> 40:37.059
Trouble seems to find me
without any help.

40:38.699 --> 40:39.728
Good luck.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.426
- How you doing there, brother?
- I'm fine, Sam.

40:46.881 --> 40:50.021
- I could have done this meeting alone.
- I know.

40:50.146 --> 40:51.780
Just wanted to get some air,

40:51.905 --> 40:54.117
go for a ride with my pal
in sunny Miami.

40:56.923 --> 40:58.663
Sunshine, you know?

40:58.974 --> 41:02.651
What the hell am I gonna do?
You got a target on your back.

41:03.198 --> 41:06.151
- There's nobody else protecting you.
- I don't need a bodyguard.

41:06.276 --> 41:07.746
I need an agency.

41:08.256 --> 41:11.276
It's time for me to get my old job back,
my real job.

41:11.401 --> 41:15.327
We went through this. Just because
folks that burned you are laying off

41:15.452 --> 41:17.571
doesn't change the fact
that you're radioactive.

41:17.696 --> 41:20.685
Government types aren't gonna touch you.
You're still out.

41:20.901 --> 41:23.271
Then I'll find a way to get back in.

41:28.562 --> 41:29.569
Simple as that?

41:31.295 --> 41:32.295
Alright.

41:33.887 --> 41:35.283
You're buying the mojitos.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
