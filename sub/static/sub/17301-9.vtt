WEBVTT

00:04.812 --> 00:10.252
Tonight - Captain Jean-Luc Picard
at warp point 0.001.

00:10.252 --> 00:16.714
The Dutch make a car!
And be still my beating heart -
a new Vauxhall saloon.

00:18.392 --> 00:23.532
Good evening and welcome
to the show that has wheels.

00:23.532 --> 00:29.082
As I'm sure you know, we have
a test track outside our base here,

00:29.082 --> 00:34.692
which we use to test fast stuff -
Porsches, Ferraris, Lamborghinis.

00:34.692 --> 00:38.512
This week, the S60R -

00:38.512 --> 00:41.800
which is a Volvo.

00:43.312 --> 00:49.682
Don't think we've brought sanity
to our world of noise
and squealing tyres -

00:49.682 --> 00:54.995
because Volvo says this
is a rival for the BMW M3.

01:01.332 --> 01:05.331
To be honest it's hard to see what they're on about.

01:05.331 --> 01:10.172
It has a phone, comfortable seats,
cruise control,

01:10.172 --> 01:15.553
and it feels soft and flobbery...
Iike a big, woolly bison.

01:18.512 --> 01:22.812
It's not fast.
It has a turbo and intercoolers,

01:22.812 --> 01:27.052
but it's still only developed
300bhp -

01:27.052 --> 01:30.658
Iess than you get from the Germans.

01:34.052 --> 01:39.682
It's only when you concentrate
that you pick up the clues.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.252
The big alloy wheels.

01:42.252 --> 01:44.959
The blue engine cover.

01:46.262 --> 01:51.692
The seats - which seem to have been
made out of David Dickinson.

01:51.692 --> 01:57.312
And those three little buttons
on the dash - comfort, sport...

01:57.312 --> 02:00.702
and advanced.

02:00.702 --> 02:06.252
These buttons are the key that
unlocks Volvo's new Skyhook system.

02:06.252 --> 02:10.627
The system has more computing power
than the CIA.

02:10.627 --> 02:13.568
Let's push "sport",

02:13.568 --> 02:18.288
and let's partially disengage
one of the traction controls.

02:18.288 --> 02:21.826
There. Let's see what happens.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.008 --> 02:35.498
At this moment, the computer thinks,

02:35.498 --> 02:38.928
"Wheel's losing grip - need brakes. "

02:38.928 --> 02:43.778
"I've backed the engine power off
and power will go to the back. "

02:43.778 --> 02:47.468
"I'll pump the shock absorber up. "

02:47.468 --> 02:52.728
Then, 500ths of a second later,
it changes its mind!

02:52.728 --> 02:59.648
It thinks, "This has all the power
in the world, I'll unleash it,
I'll get the back brakes on. "

02:59.648 --> 03:05.438
From in here, I have no idea
that any of this is going on.

03:05.438 --> 03:07.708
It's relaxing.

03:07.708 --> 03:13.378
I can just sit here,
listening to the excellent stereo,

03:13.378 --> 03:18.198
and speculate on if these seats
are David Dickinson at all.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.568
They might be an offcut
of Dale Winton.

03:22.568 --> 03:25.799
A choice cut of Dale.

03:28.378 --> 03:34.578
The combination of four wheel drive
and two traction control systems

03:34.578 --> 03:37.658
makes it clever, stylish, likeable,

03:37.658 --> 03:40.718
but a boring, medium speed cruiser.

03:40.718 --> 03:45.724
A rival for the BMW M3?
I don't think so.

03:49.578 --> 03:54.578
The good thing about the technology
is that when you finish clowning,

03:54.578 --> 03:59.018
you can put the suspension
into comfort - bison - mode,

03:59.018 --> 04:04.078
sink deeper into Dale Winton,
and bumble home... in your trilby.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.888
Volvo style.

04:18.017 --> 04:22.578
What happened to the pointless
skidding around, headlights on...

04:22.578 --> 04:27.148
It won't do it! The Volvo bosses
said to their engineers,

04:27.148 --> 04:33.938
"Go away chaps, ignore the usual
Dancing Queen, let's have
Ozzy Osbourne. "

04:33.938 --> 04:37.658
They've just made the S60 safer.

04:37.658 --> 04:44.578
I have the brochure. I've never
seen so many stupid acronyms
for driver control.

04:44.578 --> 04:46.948
DCC wheel-hop control,

04:46.948 --> 04:50.018
DSTC c-r-a-p... can you turn it off?

04:50.018 --> 04:56.218
In a normal car, when you turn
the traction control off,
push a button and it's off.

04:56.218 --> 04:58.668
Not in this.

04:58.668 --> 05:02.808
You can't do it unless you're
"highly experienced".

05:02.808 --> 05:09.228
Then it says you have to push the
button five times, in succession,

05:09.228 --> 05:13.218
"with a certain frequency".
What's that?

05:13.218 --> 05:18.438
Our country cracked the Enigma code,
so we had no problem working it out.

05:18.438 --> 05:23.468
When we'd got it off,
we gave it to the Stig.

05:23.468 --> 05:29.308
Away he goes. The traction control
is completely off.

05:29.308 --> 05:34.198
The suspension is in advanced mode,
which Volvo says makes it like

05:34.198 --> 05:36.610
"a racing car".

05:38.938 --> 05:43.308
Stig's tribute to the
Walrus of Love. Tidy round Chicago.

05:43.308 --> 05:48.018
Not that fast. The real test here -
the Hammerhead.

05:48.018 --> 05:52.008
Plenty of understeer. Not good!

05:52.008 --> 05:56.668
Nothing like a racing car!
Down to the follow through.

05:56.668 --> 06:00.188
That's quick. Ooh, careful, Stig!

06:00.188 --> 06:07.448
Coming up into the penultimate bend.
Lurching a bit there. The Volvo's
four seconds down on the M3.

06:07.448 --> 06:12.668
It smoothes through...
and past the line!

06:12.668 --> 06:19.548
The time was 1 min 35 secs dead.
Whorr! So that goes...

06:19.548 --> 06:21.948
there.

06:21.948 --> 06:25.748
It's 3.2 slower than the M3 - a lot.

06:25.748 --> 06:28.308
Look at it this way.

06:28.308 --> 06:33.548
It's cheaper and less embarrassing
than the M3. Far less embarrassing.

06:33.548 --> 06:39.668
The great thing about the S60 is
that you can have it as an estate.
That is nice.

06:39.668 --> 06:43.948
It's fabulous. I love that.
It's very good.

06:43.948 --> 06:46.052
So what I'd do is buy an Audi S4.

12:51.878 --> 12:59.468
Look what we have - the new Mazda
RX-8, which arrived this morning
on a plane from Japan.

12:59.468 --> 13:04.698
Here's the proof -
Japanese bird poo! With SARS.

13:04.698 --> 13:08.748
You're looking and thinking,
"Very nice. "

13:08.748 --> 13:14.108
"Rotary engine, £20,000. There's
other coupes I could get for that. "

13:14.108 --> 13:19.138
Sure - Nissan Z-car, Audi TT,
Toyota Celica and so forth.

13:19.138 --> 13:22.308
None can do this. Here's one door.

13:22.308 --> 13:27.058
If you want to get in the back -
look at that! Brilliant!

13:27.058 --> 13:29.788
We're sold on that here.

13:29.788 --> 13:32.698
We wanted James to test it.

13:32.698 --> 13:40.059
He said, "No, I'd rather go
to Germany and drive an American
car that runs on seawater. "

13:42.188 --> 13:44.888
The car's over 100 years old.

13:44.888 --> 13:47.898
In that time, it's evolved nicely.

13:47.898 --> 13:53.068
But let's be honest -
it's never really changed.

13:53.068 --> 13:55.138
Until now.

13:59.848 --> 14:03.948
This is the General Motors Highwire.

14:03.948 --> 14:07.648
It looks like a car, with wheels,
windows.

14:07.648 --> 14:12.148
But it is a revolution
in how a car works.

14:18.808 --> 14:23.118
What makes the Highwire go
is contained...

14:23.118 --> 14:26.408
in an 11 inch deep chassis here.

14:26.408 --> 14:30.648
There's no engine - that's gone.
There's no gearbox.

14:30.648 --> 14:36.708
There's no fascia or pedals,
no link between the driver
and the driving.

14:36.708 --> 14:41.328
It's replaced with this -
a computer cable.

14:41.328 --> 14:44.538
This isn't science fiction.

14:44.538 --> 14:47.655
I'm going to drive it.

14:50.128 --> 14:54.968
You'll notice I've got into
the wrong side of the car.

14:54.968 --> 14:59.448
But it's not a problem.
There are no pedals.

14:59.448 --> 15:02.708
There you go.

15:02.708 --> 15:07.168
I can go to the ferry at Dover
in a right-hand drive car,

15:07.168 --> 15:12.218
and drive off the other end
in Calais in a left-hand drive car.

15:12.218 --> 15:14.728
Let's see if we can make this go.

15:14.728 --> 15:19.218
Power, then select "Drive"
on the button there.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.153
Twist to accelerate...

15:24.408 --> 15:28.549
Squeeze them, and we brake.
That's fantastic.

15:30.328 --> 15:32.848
But this is weird.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.328
It's very airy,
and there's a big floor,

15:36.328 --> 15:42.138
and look at the size of that window!
It's sort of like driving a patio.

15:42.138 --> 15:48.258
This doesn't feel natural. It's
logical, but it's not second nature,

15:48.258 --> 15:50.768
as I'm used to driving a normal car.

15:50.768 --> 15:56.178
But someone in the PlayStation
generation could drive this easily,

15:56.178 --> 15:58.648
on level ten, probably!

15:58.648 --> 16:04.448
Rear-view mirror? Bit 20th century,
so we'll have a TV screen here.

16:04.448 --> 16:08.538
As for door mirrors,
we'll have TVs there too.

16:08.538 --> 16:12.328
Sorry if I'm not talking
in a normal voice,

16:12.328 --> 16:15.718
but I am concentrating very hard
here.

16:15.718 --> 16:22.138
There's only one of these
in the world, and it's worth
about five million quid.

16:22.138 --> 16:27.110
Right. Let's have the top off
this thing, to see how it works.

16:28.938 --> 16:33.708
That's easy. With no mechanical
linkages to worry about,

16:33.708 --> 16:37.058
it's a simple matter
of undoing bolts

16:37.058 --> 16:39.538
and whipping out the computer cable.

16:42.128 --> 16:47.908
This electric motor drives it.
This is the hydrogen fuel tank,

16:47.908 --> 16:52.918
and this is the fuel cell.
In this, hydrogen from the tank

16:52.918 --> 16:58.558
combines with oxygen in the air
to produce electricity.

16:58.558 --> 17:02.238
There are no batteries to recharge
anywhere.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.818
This has its own
on-board power station.

17:05.818 --> 17:10.578
It generates so much electricity
that I could run my house off it.

17:10.578 --> 17:13.080
I could run half my street off it.

17:14.278 --> 17:20.338
But the real stroke of genius
is combining hydrogen power
with bi-wire controls,

17:20.338 --> 17:25.098
because here's something
you can't do with your car.

17:25.098 --> 17:27.938
This is essentially a family saloon.

17:27.938 --> 17:34.818
But what if you wanted a pick-up,
a people carrier or even a
two-seater convertible sports car?

17:34.818 --> 17:38.108
Well... change it!

17:38.108 --> 17:42.978
Go to the dealer, get him to unbolt
this body, and plug a new one in.

17:42.978 --> 17:48.498
It'll only take half an hour. Or
better, get him to bring one round.

17:48.498 --> 17:53.578
The Highwire is made by General
Motors, and they own Vauxhall.

17:53.578 --> 17:57.618
Know what this is?
This is the new Vectra!

17:57.618 --> 18:01.778
Not the next one,
and probably not the one after that,

18:01.778 --> 18:04.281
but one day...

18:05.818 --> 18:09.518
If we forget
all the Tomorrow's World stuff,

18:09.518 --> 18:14.288
the most important thing about
this is the hydrogen power station.

18:14.288 --> 18:16.878
Yeah. It's the fuel of the future.

18:16.878 --> 18:22.558
They say that in 10 or 20 years,
they can do this. 10 or 20 years?

18:22.558 --> 18:28.488
And you get hydrogen from... Salt
water. You make it from salt water.

18:28.488 --> 18:34.028
And all you get out of the exhaust
is... Water. So this is the future.

18:34.028 --> 18:38.478
Remember this moment.
That is the car of the future.

18:38.478 --> 18:43.748
Never mind the future, let's look
at gadgets you can get hold of now.

18:43.748 --> 18:48.508
First up, this. I think this is
going to be exceptionally useful.

18:48.508 --> 18:53.898
I know what that is. You can
put it in the back of your car.

18:53.898 --> 18:56.768
And you can send messages to people.

18:56.768 --> 19:01.588
I've always wanted one of these.
Think of the things you could write!

19:01.588 --> 19:05.488
You get on,
and I'll programme a message in.

19:05.488 --> 19:08.508
What is that? This is an alarm.

19:08.508 --> 19:13.698
It's got a little Formula 1 car,
a McLaren, and it does this.

19:13.698 --> 19:18.488
Imagine it's a one-night stand,
and it's time for your alarm.

19:18.488 --> 19:22.468
TINNY ENGINE WHINE
At seven in the morning!

19:22.468 --> 19:26.308
But better still,
you can then lean across

19:26.308 --> 19:32.048
and press the accelerator.
WHINE GETS MORE FURIOUS

19:32.048 --> 19:36.808
That's not a noise you want in your
bedroom at seven in the morning!

19:36.808 --> 19:40.968
My advice is, leave it.
I don't believe this.

19:40.968 --> 19:46.128
We've broken every gadget... It's
a disaster. It censors your message.

19:46.128 --> 19:49.458
What? It censors your message!
LAUGHTER

19:49.458 --> 19:53.531
It doesn't really? No, look. Watch.

19:57.648 --> 20:00.888
It won't do swearwords.

20:00.888 --> 20:03.878
That's a piece of clever technology,

20:03.878 --> 20:09.248
and the first thing you thought of
to do with it was swear. Genius!

20:09.248 --> 20:13.108
Look at this.
It's a car driving along...

20:13.108 --> 20:16.988
Oh, wow! Look at that!
How does that work?

20:16.988 --> 20:19.968
You can write that on your wheels?

20:19.968 --> 20:23.328
That's witchcraft.
Can it censor that?

20:23.328 --> 20:27.108
Or can I write whatever I like?
LAUGHTER

20:27.108 --> 20:32.668
What's that? It's a stereo. You put
your CD in it in the normal manner,

20:32.668 --> 20:37.368
but it then memorises the contents
onto a hard disk like a computer.

20:37.368 --> 20:40.828
Like an MP3 or iPod. Very much so.

20:40.828 --> 20:45.588
Then you don't have to carry CDs
around. And mine wouldn't be stolen,

20:45.588 --> 20:48.108
because I can put a sticker saying,

20:48.108 --> 20:52.268
"This contains traces
of Barclay James Harvest. "

20:52.268 --> 20:58.208
Anyone who nicked it would go, "No!"
Like those who want drum 'n' bass.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.998
"How do I get it off?"

21:00.998 --> 21:06.268
Can we steal that? They won't
want it back. I'm having that.

21:06.268 --> 21:11.008
What's this rag? This is clever.
This is good. Let me have a look.

21:11.008 --> 21:15.738
This is a shirt. It cost £2,000.
£2,500. Sorry, £2,500.

21:15.738 --> 21:19.548
It's made of material
with metal in it,

21:19.548 --> 21:25.208
and it irons itself. Even if you
scrumpled it in your suitcase,

21:25.208 --> 21:30.218
the heat from your body irons it.
Good for sales reps. Just put it on,

21:30.218 --> 21:36.018
and drive with the heater on. It's
got aftershave smell in it as well.

21:36.018 --> 21:40.548
It's ridiculous. It's small size.
Oh, no!

21:40.548 --> 21:45.288
Go and try it on. We want
to see if it works. Seriously?

21:45.288 --> 21:50.138
Even if it doesn't work, boy, we're
going to have a laugh at you anyway!

21:50.138 --> 21:55.658
Thanks, guys! Go on, go and find
a changing room. Go and help him!

21:55.658 --> 22:01.828
Right, that's got rid of Shorty.
Good, as there's only two of these.
This is what I arrived on.

22:01.828 --> 22:06.598
You can stand on it, even though
it's only got two wheels,

22:06.598 --> 22:10.678
because it's got a gyroscope
that balances you.

22:10.678 --> 22:15.108
To go forwards, just lean forwards,
and it goes that way.

22:15.108 --> 22:20.358
Then I brake by leaning backwards,
and then go backwards again!

22:20.358 --> 22:23.598
It's simple. And you can do this.

22:23.598 --> 22:28.688
I'm a dancer. Just turn your
handlebar that way to go that way.

22:28.688 --> 22:31.598
They're made in America, of course,

22:31.598 --> 22:36.348
so that fat Yanks could go to
the fridge without expending energy!

22:36.348 --> 22:40.398
How much do they cost?
They start at £2,500.

22:40.398 --> 22:43.628
But they're not legal in Britain.

22:43.628 --> 22:49.998
They're not registered for use
on roads, and you can't use it
on the pavement.

22:49.998 --> 22:54.758
They're worried that any idiot
could go out and buy one of these.

22:54.758 --> 22:58.958
Has that man got that shirt on?
I don't know. Hammond?

22:58.958 --> 23:01.984
JEREMY GUFFAWS WITH LAUGHTER

23:04.138 --> 23:06.868
AUDIENCE CHEER

23:07.878 --> 23:13.058
So, Hammond, are you hot? Am I hot?
I'm in a room with 300 people

23:13.058 --> 23:18.698
and 1,000 lamps, and I'm wearing
this! Yes, I am hot! Does it work?

23:18.698 --> 23:21.440
You look like D'Artagnan,
but shorter.

23:23.397 --> 23:30.397
Last week, Jodie Kidd
drove our Suzuki Liana
faster than any other celebrity.

23:30.397 --> 23:36.627
9.05 the following morning,
we had a call from a
Mr Jay Kay of Buckinghamshire,

23:36.627 --> 23:39.837
who'd been leading
for nine months or so

23:39.837 --> 23:42.587
and he said, "I'll be back. "

23:42.587 --> 23:50.327
Mr Kay, there's little point. My
guest tonight travels the universe
at nine times the speed of light.

23:50.327 --> 23:54.837
He is the captain of
the USS Enterprise. Patrick Stewart!

23:54.837 --> 23:56.930
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

23:58.437 --> 24:02.783
How are you? Have a seat.
Thank you. Thank you.

24:07.357 --> 24:09.700
Whoo-hoo! Oh, yes!

24:13.077 --> 24:18.356
You're our most famous guest ever.
This must be a terrible show, then.

24:20.137 --> 24:23.557
There was Richard Whiteley.
Yes, yes...

24:23.557 --> 24:27.157
He's a legend
from Wakefield to Newcastle.

24:27.157 --> 24:32.667
So I'm marginally more impressive?
Yeah. But marginally? Yeah.

24:32.667 --> 24:36.077
Thanks.
I feel really good being here.

24:36.077 --> 24:39.157
I understand you watched last week

24:39.157 --> 24:44.037
and I had a bit of a rant about
using mobile phones while driving.

24:44.037 --> 24:51.337
It's rare to have an opportunity
to take up an argument
with a celebrity such as yourself.

24:51.337 --> 24:53.897
LAUGHTER

24:53.897 --> 24:57.788
I mean, I use the term
"celebrity" very loosely.

24:59.477 --> 25:02.397
What's your beef about using them?

25:02.397 --> 25:07.437
As you may or may not know, I do
spend a lot of my working life -

25:07.437 --> 25:11.697
meaning my driving life -
in California, namely LA.

25:11.697 --> 25:15.367
LA is a very dangerous place
to drive.

25:15.367 --> 25:19.297
You're always vulnerable
to an incident.

25:19.297 --> 25:24.597
Many of these incidents result
from people talking on cellphones.

25:24.597 --> 25:30.557
I saw a woman the other day on the
freeway, where we do 55, 60, 65...

25:30.557 --> 25:34.297
I'm amazed
they can breathe at that speed.

25:34.297 --> 25:36.327
Jeez!

25:36.327 --> 25:41.297
She's talking on her cellphone.
She's steering with her left elbow,

25:41.297 --> 25:44.247
Iike, hooked into the wheel,

25:44.247 --> 25:48.917
because, with her right hand,
she's doing her mascara.

25:48.917 --> 25:55.397
I do that, except for the mascara.
And you need it.
I'm fully made-up today.

25:55.397 --> 25:59.507
I think it was irresponsible.
What I did?

25:59.507 --> 26:05.047
This man talked on his communicator
while being assimilated by the Bull.

26:05.047 --> 26:07.097
LAUGHTER

26:07.097 --> 26:10.707
But I've had a lot of practice,
you see.

26:10.707 --> 26:14.637
I think, "Who are you talking to
in your car?"

26:14.637 --> 26:18.707
And it's a hands-free thing,
which I've got in my car.

26:18.707 --> 26:22.957
What are you doing looking at them?
Where should your attention be?

26:22.957 --> 26:29.497
I'm bored! Driving's boring!
I think, "Look at him! What sort
of geography does he teach?"

26:29.497 --> 26:32.727
LAUGHTER

26:32.727 --> 26:37.517
In his case, yes, you're right.
Exactly. So why are you over here?

26:37.517 --> 26:41.067
You do spend most of your time
in Los Angeles.

26:41.067 --> 26:46.667
Purely because of work. I have
a home in North Yorkshire. And...

26:46.667 --> 26:49.817
I love that! In Skipton?
Near Skipton.

26:49.817 --> 26:54.107
The captain of the USS Enterprise
lives in Skipton!

26:54.107 --> 26:59.147
But why you're here... Yes,
I'm here because it's all changing.

26:59.147 --> 27:02.507
I'm doing a play
called The Master Builder.

27:02.507 --> 27:08.147
It's by Henrik Ibsen and it
stars... myself and Sue Johnston

27:08.147 --> 27:14.627
and a brilliant young actress, less
than a year out of drama school
called Lisa Dillon,

27:14.627 --> 27:19.097
who is "the other woman".
The 19 year old? Yes.

27:19.097 --> 27:23.307
Is anybody here familiar
with The Master Builder?

27:23.307 --> 27:27.987
The BBC's slated for its lack of
arts coverage, we can rectify that.

27:27.987 --> 27:33.555
You invite me onto the show, knowing
that I'm doing The Master Builder.

27:33.555 --> 27:40.065
Here's what most people,
here's the connection -
Henrik Ibsen, famous playwright,

27:40.065 --> 27:44.025
and distinguisehed Formula Four
and rally car driver.

27:44.025 --> 27:45.985
Yes!

27:45.985 --> 27:48.825
Very few people know about this,

27:48.825 --> 27:52.225
which is why my being on this show
is appropriate.

27:52.225 --> 27:57.825
He was clever, seeing as he wrote
plays before they invented the car.

27:57.825 --> 28:02.465
That was the early stages
of his career. So he went on...?

28:02.465 --> 28:07.865
He gave up the writing after
The Dolls House. He just got bored.

28:07.865 --> 28:12.305
The Scandinavians
are great rally drivers. Absolutely.

28:12.305 --> 28:15.955
It all began with him.
It's a little known fact.

28:15.955 --> 28:21.825
Oversteer and Ibsen on
the same show! That is culture.

28:21.825 --> 28:28.565
The Master Builder is an architect
who builds a big tower
and jumps off it.

28:28.565 --> 28:31.305
That's the essence of the play.

28:31.305 --> 28:35.385
In a sentence, yes it is,
but it does miss out...

28:35.385 --> 28:38.235
It misses out some critical factors.

28:38.235 --> 28:42.225
It's about a very successful
and powerful architect,

28:42.225 --> 28:48.145
who is at the emotional point of
implosion when the play begins.

28:48.145 --> 28:53.785
Into his tortured existence,
he's married - to Sue Johnstone -

28:53.785 --> 28:57.675
appears this...
Beautiful 19-year-old girl.

28:57.675 --> 29:04.375
She says. "Ten years ago, you said
I was your princess and in ten years
time you'd come for me.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.255
"Here I am. "

29:06.255 --> 29:09.045
And he jumps off his tower?..Yes.

29:09.045 --> 29:14.435
This man wrote a play about a duck
that gets shot. Yes.

29:14.435 --> 29:18.975
Your plot lines
on the Enterprise were better.

29:18.975 --> 29:22.325
Now, cars. Yes! Why we're here.
Absolutely.

29:22.325 --> 29:27.095
You do love your cars.
This much is obvious. Yes...

29:27.095 --> 29:29.725
There's one primary reason.

29:29.725 --> 29:36.785
We were quite poor when we grew up.
My parents never owned a car
and didn't drive.

29:36.785 --> 29:41.095
In my street,
only one family owned a car.

29:41.095 --> 29:44.165
The Cloughs had this SS Jagwar...

29:44.165 --> 29:48.855
Sorry, Jaguar. It's living in
America. You learn to say "Jagwar".

29:48.855 --> 29:52.125
Unlearn it now,
because we're back in...

29:52.125 --> 29:57.395
Yes, I know where we are. Not only
was this a fabulously beautiful car,

29:57.395 --> 30:03.695
but the Cloughs
had an attractive daughter...
You never know who's watching.

30:03.695 --> 30:06.645
I hope she is watching.

30:06.645 --> 30:11.295
Valerie, are you still out there?
She's behind the sofa.

30:11.295 --> 30:14.495
You missed out, Val.
So what happened?

30:14.495 --> 30:19.555
We would make out in the back of
the SS Jaguar, so it wasn't just...

30:19.555 --> 30:21.995
By that, I mean, you know...

30:21.995 --> 30:25.863
Heavy petting, as the term is.
LAUGHTER

30:27.595 --> 30:31.215
I wasn't quite sure
which excited me more,

30:31.215 --> 30:34.815
the heavy petting
or being in the SS Jaguar.

30:34.815 --> 30:38.615
I should have been excited
by the Jaguar.

30:38.615 --> 30:42.995
It's the double whammy, isn't it?
That's the great thing.

30:42.995 --> 30:45.615
You do love your Jags. I do, yes.

30:45.615 --> 30:50.495
I'm on my second now. I've had
this one for almost 14 years.

30:50.495 --> 30:52.855
I bought an XJS,

30:52.855 --> 30:55.485
the 12-cylinder, the big monster,

30:55.485 --> 31:00.535
convertible, in 1989
and I simply couldn't get rid of it.

31:00.535 --> 31:04.055
There's no more beautiful
production car.

31:04.055 --> 31:10.995
It's British racing green. It has
wire wheels which are a nightmare.
To clean.

31:10.995 --> 31:16.665
I don't have to clean the wheels.
He's on more than 130 quid a week.

31:16.665 --> 31:21.275
I have a wire-wheel cleaning man
who comes to me to clean.

31:21.275 --> 31:26.335
Is it the car you've bequeathed?
Yeah, it's named in my will.

31:26.335 --> 31:31.605
I told my son he would get it.
He's getting sod-all else, mind you.

31:31.605 --> 31:37.405
And it isn't worth that much.
Frankly, he'll get £1.50, won't he?

31:37.405 --> 31:40.895
On the other hand,
look at it this way.

31:40.895 --> 31:45.725
It is Captain Picard's Jaguar
and that's got to do something.

31:45.725 --> 31:49.395
£2.50.
LAUGHTER

31:49.395 --> 31:56.015
Can you have fun driving
in America? I find it tricky,
ignoring the phone malarky.

31:56.015 --> 32:01.065
Well, if you find it fun
to practise defensive driving -

32:01.065 --> 32:04.415
you know what I mean -
then it can be fun.

32:04.415 --> 32:07.345
You always expect the worst.

32:07.345 --> 32:12.405
What I enjoy are the long road trips,
driving out into the desert.

32:12.405 --> 32:18.015
I love going to Northern California
and taking several days.

32:18.015 --> 32:23.675
But where are the corners? There...
On freeways you don't get many.

32:23.675 --> 32:28.065
There is one famous place,
at least for Angelinos.

32:28.065 --> 32:33.425
There's a section of Sunset
Boulevard, just in Brentwood,

32:33.425 --> 32:37.455
before Beverly Hills.
You know what he's talking about.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.265
He doesn't, he's no idea!

32:40.265 --> 32:45.695
There are these three banked corners
on Sunset - "Dead Man's Curve".

32:45.695 --> 32:50.985
You've got... a right-hander,
a left-hander and a right-hander.

32:50.985 --> 32:54.825
They're steeply banked
in the right direction.

32:54.825 --> 32:58.585
Those of us who love it,
we hang back,

32:58.585 --> 33:03.885
for gap between the cars in front,
as you approach, hit the gas

33:03.885 --> 33:08.005
and hope that there's no police cars
watching.

33:08.005 --> 33:12.425
You can do these turns
as if you're in a Formula One car.

33:12.425 --> 33:16.865
The problem is a homeowner there
has a sprinkler system

33:16.865 --> 33:18.685
and...

33:18.685 --> 33:23.105
and it come on,
so you can hit this at 12am

33:23.105 --> 33:26.985
and the road
suddenly becomes like glass.

33:26.985 --> 33:29.765
No traction control on your XJS?

33:29.765 --> 33:34.985
No traction control on that.
My wife has a Mercedes CL500,

33:34.985 --> 33:37.705
which is an extraordinary vehicle.

33:37.705 --> 33:41.245
You'd be safe in that. Panzer tank.

33:41.245 --> 33:46.365
No, the Cl is not a tank, actually.
It's a heavy thing!

33:46.365 --> 33:49.402
It's a two-door.
Weighs more than the Enterprise.

33:52.105 --> 33:57.565
So you've been out in the Suzuki
Liana. How do you think you got on?

33:57.565 --> 34:01.385
I'm not too optimistic...
I know, I know.

34:01.385 --> 34:04.705
I would love to beat Gambon. Gambon?

34:04.705 --> 34:07.785
His time was 1.55, but in the wet.

34:07.785 --> 34:12.425
You'd like to have beaten him?
He's a colleague and fine actor,

34:12.425 --> 34:16.304
but I would like to see him
eat my dust.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.225
He did a spectacular manoeuvre.

34:19.225 --> 34:24.355
I know. Two wheels around the
corner. Shall we find out? Play it.

34:24.355 --> 34:29.292
That's a great sight -
you off the bridge and in a Suzuki.

34:31.275 --> 34:35.291
Ooh, serious.
How did you find the car? Ordinary.

34:36.965 --> 34:42.405
Sliding a bit wide, bit too
much power, if I might be so bold.

34:42.405 --> 34:45.455
I look good, though. You do.

34:45.455 --> 34:48.764
This is the... The hammerhead.
That's...

34:48.764 --> 34:54.235
That's where Jodie Kidd was quick,
because she wasn't overdriving it.

34:54.235 --> 34:56.985
Ooh, that's very fast.

34:56.985 --> 35:00.515
Here we are,
coming up to Gambon corner...

35:00.515 --> 35:04.167
and you're across the line!
CHEERING

35:07.775 --> 35:11.865
So, you wanna hazard a guess? No.
Whiteley....

35:11.865 --> 35:17.185
Two years. Two light years actually
and six warps or whatever it is.

35:17.185 --> 35:23.475
Well, in fact, you did it,
and welcome
to a very exclusive little club,

35:23.475 --> 35:27.595
in one minute, 50 seconds.
Same time.

35:27.595 --> 35:30.484
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

35:32.525 --> 35:34.402
No kidding.

35:36.735 --> 35:41.835
That's the same time as me, as
Jamie Oliver and as Gordon Ramsay.

35:41.835 --> 35:46.425
I think that's a reasonable time,
don't you?

35:46.425 --> 35:50.555
LAUGHTER
You've just made me very happy.

35:50.555 --> 35:56.135
I might buy the show out and go on
the town. A second ahead of Gambon.

35:56.135 --> 35:58.475
Yesss!

35:58.475 --> 36:02.755
Ladies and gentlemen,
Patrick Stewart! Thank you.

36:02.755 --> 36:05.337
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:09.375 --> 36:11.155
Right...

36:11.155 --> 36:15.795
Earlier on, we looked at
some pretty impressive gadgets,

36:15.795 --> 36:19.663
but here's the best gadget
of them all.

36:23.995 --> 36:29.335
The Carver. So it's
a sort of a bike thing. Well, no.

36:29.335 --> 36:34.935
It's got car wheels on the back and
standard car controls to drive it.

36:34.935 --> 36:39.895
And 0 to 60 takes eight seconds,
which in bike terms is a week.

36:41.055 --> 36:43.735
So it's a sort of a car? Well...

36:43.735 --> 36:47.435
no, it's not a car,
because it does this...

36:47.435 --> 36:49.562
Whoaarr!

36:51.415 --> 36:53.575
Sensational!

36:53.575 --> 37:00.395
It's got a 660cc turbo-charged
engine that's good for
115 fun-filled miles an hour.

37:00.395 --> 37:03.475
Help! I'm falling over!

37:03.475 --> 37:06.555
Trust me, that's enough.

37:06.555 --> 37:09.183
I'm in an insane machine!

37:14.135 --> 37:17.475
It may look like
a piece of lunatic fun,

37:17.475 --> 37:20.835
but it's actually very difficult
to tilt.

37:20.835 --> 37:25.885
It uses hydraulic rams that allow
it to go over at ridiculous angles.

37:25.885 --> 37:30.935
You can end up at 45 degrees,
which... Well, that's madness.

37:30.935 --> 37:35.755
It then gets tricky. The engine
is in this bit, that doesn't tilt,

37:35.755 --> 37:41.715
you're in the bit that does tilt
and it's all got to connect up.

37:41.715 --> 37:49.201
That's one of the reasons
why it's so complicated
and also why it's so spectacular.

37:53.165 --> 37:57.635
The tilt isn't determined
by how far you turn the wheel.

37:57.635 --> 38:01.705
It's how hard,
so if you tip the wheel hard,

38:01.705 --> 38:04.015
you tilt.

38:04.015 --> 38:08.865
But if you're gentle,
it doesn't tilt so much,

38:08.865 --> 38:14.155
so at slow speeds, you can turn it
for a full lock and it stays level.

38:17.525 --> 38:21.825
But if I get more aggressive,
it all goes insane.

38:21.825 --> 38:24.976
I am in a road-going fighter plane!

38:26.795 --> 38:30.385
I want guns,
something that fires missiles.

38:30.385 --> 38:32.935
Go out for a bit of a dogfight,

38:32.935 --> 38:36.305
because one thing's unlikely
ever to happen...

38:36.305 --> 38:38.910
You won't come across another one.

38:41.705 --> 38:46.145
The Carver is the result of
11 years' design and development

38:46.145 --> 38:48.725
by those crazy, sexy Dutch.

38:48.725 --> 38:54.095
And they believe it could herald
a whole new way of motoring.

38:54.095 --> 38:56.655
Now, the bad news is...

38:58.245 --> 39:01.624
it's not cheap - £22,500, but...

39:02.825 --> 39:06.405
this is the gadget
to end all gadgets.

39:06.405 --> 39:10.325
STAR WARS THEME
It's insane!

39:10.325 --> 39:13.135
Who could possibly need one?

39:14.725 --> 39:17.455
Me, actually. Definitely.

39:21.545 --> 39:25.885
And the roof comes out of it.
It's a convertible thing.

39:25.885 --> 39:31.345
The best thing is you know it comes
from a place where drugs are legal.

39:31.345 --> 39:34.165
It could only have been the Dutch.

39:34.165 --> 39:41.265
You can see them listening to Bob
Marley and someone says, "Cars -
too many wheels, let's lose one".

39:41.265 --> 39:46.023
My favourite Dutch story
is they had an explorer years ago

39:46.023 --> 39:50.783
called Abel Tasman, who went to
the South Seas to find new lands.

39:50.783 --> 39:56.983
He found Tasmania -
that's named after him, he found
New Zealand and the Fiji islands.

39:56.983 --> 40:01.143
He MISSED Australia!
It's easily done.

40:01.143 --> 40:05.433
IN DUTCH ACCENT: I was having
a smoke, went right past it!

40:05.433 --> 40:10.143
It's unbelievable. Then they
brought it over to this country.

40:10.143 --> 40:14.983
Because it's not a car, not a bike,
the bloke in a suit over here,

40:14.983 --> 40:19.953
he didn't know what to do. So as
a result, you don't need a helmet.

40:19.953 --> 40:24.663
No, my wife drove it. There you go.
I had one of these last weekend

40:24.663 --> 40:30.043
and I have to say, hand on heart,
I've never had so much fun in a car.

40:30.043 --> 40:33.113
And I don't think I'd tire of it.

40:33.113 --> 40:37.843
You never tire of people coming
around going, "Can I have a go?"

40:37.843 --> 40:42.093
The kids were like, "Let's have
another ride in that car. "

40:42.093 --> 40:48.953
When it leans, it really, really
banks over. And you have these
warning lights. Did you show those?

40:48.953 --> 40:51.783
Warning lights on the dashboard.

40:51.783 --> 40:56.753
It goes through the green bit and
into the red when it leans too much.

40:56.753 --> 41:02.053
It said in my letter, "And this
is good fun! " It gives you a target.

41:02.053 --> 41:07.673
Two red lights...four! The kids go,
"How many lights have you got on? "

41:07.673 --> 41:10.453
"All of the red ones! "

41:10.453 --> 41:13.063
Oh! I loved it.

41:13.063 --> 41:18.593
The great thing was I went to
a party... What, in this? Yeah.

41:18.593 --> 41:23.513
And as, I admit,
I may have had a sherry or two...

41:23.513 --> 41:28.593
You didn't? Yeah, and decided
I wouldn't drive back in this.

41:28.593 --> 41:34.503
My wife said she'd drive, and that
meant... You were a passenger? Yeah.

41:34.503 --> 41:36.593
You're joking.

41:36.593 --> 41:39.073
No. I don't believe you.

41:39.073 --> 41:44.113
I tell you, I can get in the back
of this. Shall I do the seat?

41:44.113 --> 41:48.143
Yeah. There is an art to getting in.
You are joking.

41:48.143 --> 41:52.273
To do it in a crazy, sexy way.
Oh, you see, look.

41:52.273 --> 41:55.203
I can't believe it! I'm getting in.

41:55.203 --> 41:58.373
Do you see, this is...

41:58.373 --> 42:05.993
This is a country where a gay
marriage is legal.
He is my partner and also my lover.

42:05.993 --> 42:11.215
Lift your foot. Look at that!
That's marvellous. It worked.

42:15.353 --> 42:19.523
Oh, mate, I'll never get that
out of my mind -

42:19.523 --> 42:23.313
jammed between Jeremy's thighs
in a Dutch three-wheeler!

42:23.313 --> 42:32.753
Now you may have read in the paper
that Britain is one of the cheapest
places in Europe to buy a new car,

42:32.753 --> 42:36.923
and that manufacturers want to
increase prices by 3%.

42:36.923 --> 42:41.423
In fact it's irrelevant
because you'd have to be a donkey

42:41.423 --> 42:47.623
to pay the full list price for any
car in Britain. Speak your mind!

42:47.623 --> 42:51.993
The Saab 93 two-litre turbo -
£1,900 off.

42:51.993 --> 42:57.283
The Audi TT, the 225bhp version,
£2,500 off. This gets better.

42:57.283 --> 43:01.000
BMW 320 diesel, £3,500 off.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.723
Mercedes C-Class 200 auto,
£5,500 off. No!

43:06.283 --> 43:12.083
This is my favourite - the Maserati
4000 GT Spider, ten grand off.

43:12.083 --> 43:17.793
Now, Fiesta-size cars. This is
the biggest market in Britain now.

43:17.793 --> 43:23.613
It's been growing for five years
but it's still oversupplied.

43:23.613 --> 43:27.183
Think of £1,000 off
a Ford Fiesta or Ka.

43:27.183 --> 43:31.353
£1,500 off a Vauxhall Corsa Active,
£1,100 off a one-litre Lupo,

43:31.353 --> 43:34.723
over £2,000 off a Toyota Yaris,

43:34.723 --> 43:38.033
top spec, 1.3 litre engine.
Lovely car.

43:44.933 --> 43:48.483
From the front,
this looks like a Vectra.

43:48.483 --> 43:53.603
Under the bonnet it has the same
choice of engines as the Vectra.

43:53.603 --> 44:01.203
And under the body, the chassis
is the same as you'll get
in next year's Vectra estate.

44:01.203 --> 44:04.563
It even feels like a Vectra
to drive.

44:04.563 --> 44:09.443
Apart from these silly indicators
that have a mind of their own,

44:09.443 --> 44:13.393
it's a collection of elements
from the periodic table.

44:13.393 --> 44:16.763
This, however, is not a Vectra.

44:16.763 --> 44:22.043
With its shapely but large
J-Lo rear end, this is the future.

44:22.043 --> 44:25.069
This is the new Vauxhall Signum.

44:29.803 --> 44:34.403
The most obvious difference
is this panel in the roof

44:34.403 --> 44:37.123
which contains storage bins.

44:37.123 --> 44:42.403
Now, this one is very useful
for storing sunglasses.

44:42.403 --> 44:47.683
These two here, it's difficult to
fathom what you might fit in them.

44:47.683 --> 44:54.703
Nothing you normally keep in a car
would fit. Road maps, CDs,
boxes of tissues and so on.

44:54.703 --> 45:00.203
The only thing I can find which
fits is a stick of celery which...

45:00.203 --> 45:03.493
Look at that, perfect.

45:03.493 --> 45:05.963
And that shows

45:05.963 --> 45:11.903
a level of thoughtfulness we've
not seen from any other car maker.

45:11.903 --> 45:16.243
In every other car I've driven,
the celery rolls around,

45:16.243 --> 45:19.963
getting in the way
of major controls.

45:19.963 --> 45:26.343
No, really, who else provides
storage for celery? Not even
the new Rolls-Royce has that.

45:26.343 --> 45:31.713
But the biggest change
with this car is found in the back.

45:32.853 --> 45:37.173
You get a lot more space
than you do in a Vectra.

45:37.173 --> 45:42.563
And these seats slide forwards
and backwards and they recline

45:42.563 --> 45:45.013
and they fold flat.

45:45.013 --> 45:47.923
But there are only two of them.

45:47.923 --> 45:53.613
In the middle, in this base model
which is £18,000, is a drinks tray

45:53.613 --> 45:57.003
or an arm rest, or nothing at all.

45:57.003 --> 46:04.043
In the more expensive models which
go up to £25,000, what you get here
is a fridge and a DVD player.

46:04.043 --> 46:08.653
So, this is a wonderful car
for people in the back.

46:08.653 --> 46:13.795
And that's great -
apart from one small thing.

46:15.293 --> 46:20.853
I've come to the M40
on a Tuesday morning at 10.45.

46:20.853 --> 46:25.683
And I'm going to give £1
to the Donkey Sanctuary in Devon

46:25.683 --> 46:33.033
for every car that drives past here
in the next hour that has
someone sitting in the back... No.

46:33.033 --> 46:34.876
No.

46:36.113 --> 46:38.293
No. No.

46:38.293 --> 46:43.133
Discovery, seven seats,
and... one person in it.

46:43.133 --> 46:48.433
No, no, no. Vectra. Still no.

46:48.433 --> 46:51.433
Think of the donkeys!

46:51.433 --> 46:54.175
No. Yes!

46:59.553 --> 47:05.059
Right, time's up. Let's see how
much we've raised for the donkeys.

47:06.253 --> 47:12.133
£4. Four cars, in an hour,
with someone in the back.

47:12.133 --> 47:18.373
So why has Vauxhall made a car
for a market that doesn't exist?

47:18.373 --> 47:23.933
They say it does. They say
they did lots and lots of research

47:23.933 --> 47:32.333
and they found lots of people who
wanted tons of space in the back
of their car - but only two seats.

47:32.333 --> 47:39.013
And all these people had one thing
in common - they were all men.

47:39.013 --> 47:45.773
But I understand that. First thing
I do when I move into a new house,

47:45.773 --> 47:49.823
forget the curtains
and the carpets and the cooker -

47:49.823 --> 47:54.573
you get your TV, your stereo
and your PlayStation up and running.

47:54.573 --> 47:59.473
It's fine to have a fridge-cum-DVD
player instead of a seat.

47:59.473 --> 48:02.493
It's the obvious thing to do!

48:02.493 --> 48:07.693
Mumsy cars have lots of seats
and are as sensible as big knickers.

48:07.693 --> 48:12.583
But this has lots of gadgets so
it's the world's first dadsy car.

48:15.193 --> 48:16.833
The first car ever made

48:16.833 --> 48:20.893
which only works
if you're sitting in the back.

48:20.893 --> 48:23.633
Now there are problems with that.

48:23.633 --> 48:28.693
Like, you won't get a chauffeur
to drive what is basically a Vectra.

48:28.693 --> 48:33.703
And if you can afford a chauffeur,
you won't have a car like this.

48:33.703 --> 48:37.553
However, the great thing
about being a man

48:37.553 --> 48:40.143
is that I can improvise.

48:40.143 --> 48:43.453
So, what I have here is a hoe

48:43.453 --> 48:46.523
and another hoe

48:46.523 --> 48:49.673
and a long, extending arm thing,

48:49.673 --> 48:53.323
and some string and some duct tape,

48:53.323 --> 48:55.863
and a clamp.

48:55.863 --> 49:01.283
And I think this is going to work.

49:01.283 --> 49:04.233
Right.

49:04.233 --> 49:09.143
Attach the end to this prong
of the steering wheel.

49:09.143 --> 49:14.663
SOUND OF DUCT TAPE BEING PULLED
Made in Germany so it's strong.

49:14.663 --> 49:20.223
Where are my scissors gone?
And then we need the hoe, this one,

49:20.223 --> 49:23.703
the one with the extending arm.

49:23.703 --> 49:25.203
Good.

49:25.203 --> 49:28.643
Think I've thought of everything.
No...

49:28.643 --> 49:33.313
SOUND OF DUCT TAPE BEING PULLED
That's very good.

49:33.313 --> 49:38.143
This is a work of genius.
I've got this to operate the gears.

49:38.143 --> 49:42.863
This one does the clutch.
This is for the throttle.

49:42.863 --> 49:48.063
ENGINE ROARS
And that does the brake as well.

49:48.063 --> 49:52.783
This is the piece de resistance.
This is my steering. Look at that!

49:52.783 --> 49:57.523
So, all I have to do now is test it.

49:57.523 --> 50:02.483
And I shall give £1 to the Donkey
Sanctuary for every mile I cover

50:02.483 --> 50:04.523
without crashing.

50:04.523 --> 50:07.403
OK, here goes. Handbrake off.

50:07.403 --> 50:12.383
And, um... clutch... Clutch in.

50:12.383 --> 50:14.863
Into first.

50:16.663 --> 50:20.247
And, er... Everyone out the way.

50:28.043 --> 50:31.083
Here we go. Oh, that's a problem.

50:31.083 --> 50:36.653
If you want to go right you must
pull left. Little bit of throttle.

50:36.653 --> 50:39.483
Away she goes... Second.

50:39.483 --> 50:42.383
Nice.

50:42.383 --> 50:45.063
IT WORKS!

50:45.063 --> 50:47.384
IT WORKS!

50:49.423 --> 50:53.783
APPLAUSE
Stop!

50:53.783 --> 50:58.753
No, this is wrong! Thank you,
everybody, thank you. No!

50:58.753 --> 51:02.003
Because it didn't work. It did!

51:02.003 --> 51:06.413
It didn't work the first time.
It went a bit wrong...

51:06.413 --> 51:10.483
You crashed. I slightly went
into a field. And crashed.

51:10.483 --> 51:16.983
And slightly broke the front.
The cameras weren't rolling
for that first take

51:16.983 --> 51:22.003
but this is better because
I have the insurance claim form.

51:22.003 --> 51:27.521
"Where were you at the time
of the accident? " In the back!

51:29.643 --> 51:33.238
And on that note,
it's time to end the show.

51:33.693 --> 51:35.422
Good night!

51:55.613 --> 51:57.615
