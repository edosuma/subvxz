00:05.964 --> 00:08.173
THIS PROGRAM IS LOOSELY BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.010
CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
WERE ADAPTED FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.516
[tap squeaks]

00:20.478 --> 00:21.688
Hey!

00:22.480 --> 00:23.648
Is anybody there?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.193
Take it easy, politician!

00:27.986 --> 00:30.321
What's going on? Are you lonely?

00:30.405 --> 00:32.073
[Rangel] There's no water. I'm thirsty.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.700
Better get used to it, pal.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.078
Room service gets really bad
on weekends, if you know what I mean.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.164
Few employees around...

00:39.247 --> 00:41.458
Almost no one's here to pick up after you.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.836
Can you imagine if something nasty
was to happen to you?

00:45.336 --> 00:47.922
It'd be a long time
before they found you.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.340
[he laughs]

00:49.424 --> 00:50.550
[Ruffo] <i>At that moment,</i>

00:50.633 --> 00:54.387
<i>the destiny of the entire country</i>
<i>was in the hands of one man:</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:55.930
<i>João Pedro Rangel.</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:58.475
<i>If he opened his mouth...</i>

00:58.933 --> 01:00.435
<i>Brasília was fucked.</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:04.272
<i>Rigo and the Prosecutor's Office</i>
<i>played their first card.</i>

01:04.938 --> 01:06.900
<i>They sent the guy to hell</i>

01:06.983 --> 01:10.987
<i>to see if the devil could convince him</i>
<i>to accept a plea bargain.</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:14.949
<i>It was a good try</i>
<i>and it scared a lot of people.</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:17.827
Agostini, if you don't get
my husband out of jail,

01:18.453 --> 01:21.039
I'm going to be the one who blabs.
Is that clear enough for you?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.124
Do we understand each other?

01:24.751 --> 01:28.338
I'm not the one who needs
to understand, Samira.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.924
Ah!

01:32.133 --> 01:34.886
Then exactly who
has to understand it, Agostini?

01:34.969 --> 01:35.970
Explain it.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.556
[Mário] The state penitentiary?

01:39.349 --> 01:40.892
[Agostini] And the worst one there.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.435
Hand-picked, too.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.937
That's a low blow.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.105
They want him to crack.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.066
There's nothing I can do about it.

01:48.608 --> 01:52.987
João Pedro doesn't have the strength
for it. He's not prepared for Jaraguara.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.407
No one is prepared for Jaraguara.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.160
If they break him, it will all go to hell.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.413
[Mário breathes heavily]

02:02.497 --> 02:04.040
In Jaraguara...

02:05.125 --> 02:06.459
he will either break...

02:07.043 --> 02:08.294
or he dies.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.965
[Ruffo] <i>Rigo couldn't leave the guy</i>
<i>in Jaraguara too long.</i>

02:13.550 --> 02:15.969
<i>Someone might kill the prick.</i>

02:16.052 --> 02:18.138
<i>A dead man of that magnitude...</i>

02:18.555 --> 02:20.348
<i>would be a huge damn problem.</i>

[rainfall]

03:05.935 --> 03:07.896
[Guilhome] Nothing will lead back to you.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.691
Relax, I'll be the one
who takes the heat for it.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.322
Verena won't give me
another chance in the future.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.620
I was kind of enjoying this mess
we have going here.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.331
I'll have to go back to Rondônia.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.208
-[knocking]
-Go on.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.759
OK. Go.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.933
Give her a bath and tuck her in.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.443
[Guilhome] What if...

03:55.944 --> 04:00.281
What if Verena went after JPR's family?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.285
To make him talk
without cutting any deals?

04:22.595 --> 04:24.639
[Ruffo] <i>I never waited</i>
<i>so long in my whole my life.</i>

04:27.600 --> 04:30.687
<i>I waited for the news</i>
<i>that JPR was going to talk.</i>

04:32.230 --> 04:33.940
<i>And I waited for my wife to come home.</i>

04:40.571 --> 04:41.614
[sighs]

04:41.698 --> 04:43.074
<i>I know.</i>

04:43.157 --> 04:45.493
<i>I turned her life into a living hell.</i>

04:45.868 --> 04:47.745
<i>I had no right to bitch about it.</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:54.877
<i>In Regina's case,</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:57.922
<i>there was nothing else</i>
<i>I could do but wait.</i>

05:08.266 --> 05:10.059
<i>In JPR's case,</i> <i>the situation was a little different.</i>

05:12.895 --> 05:16.816
<i>If he kept his mouth shut,</i>
<i>I still had one last card to play.</i>

05:17.233 --> 05:21.696
<i>I just needed to know</i>
<i>if Verena was still open to suggestions.</i>

05:25.992 --> 05:26.826
[Guilhome] Hi.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
I hope one day
you'll be able to forgive me.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.290
I wasn't exactly straight with you,
I know.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.085
Ruffo is an old friend
and he asked me to help him.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.921
And you know how difficult it is
to say no to him.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.426
I realize I disrespected your command
and I am sorry for that.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.724
Ehh...

05:49.807 --> 05:52.560
This is an idea Ruffo thought might...

05:52.977 --> 05:57.023
help you get JPR to talk
without using a plea bargain.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.901
You might be able to use it.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.950
Best of luck then.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.023
[boiling water]

06:47.698 --> 06:48.825
[door unlocks]

07:00.169 --> 07:01.170
[Ruffo] Where were you?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.188
[Ruffo sighs]

07:29.073 --> 07:31.075
[Ruffo] <i>Regina left for three days.</i>

07:31.868 --> 07:33.911
<i>I never knew where she went.</i>

07:44.005 --> 07:46.841
[Beta breathes erratically]

07:56.767 --> 07:58.269
[door unlocks]

07:58.811 --> 08:02.148
[Ruffo] <i>Rigo kept JPR locked up</i>
<i>for the same amount of time.</i>

08:03.107 --> 08:05.526
<i>He'd had three days, and nothing.</i>

08:05.610 --> 08:07.778
[guard] Get up. Let's go!

08:07.862 --> 08:10.072
-[Rangel] Where?
-[guard] None of your business.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.950
-[guard] They said to get you.
-But where are you taking me?

08:14.702 --> 08:16.037
[Ruffo] <i>Yep.</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:18.372
<i>The Devil always sides with the corrupt.</i>

08:18.456 --> 08:20.124
[banging and cheering]

08:20.208 --> 08:23.878
[Ruffo] <i>The guy was a pencil-pusher,</i>
<i>but he held out.</i>

[jeering and shouting by inmates]

08:32.053 --> 08:33.471
PENITENTIARY
INMATE

08:35.347 --> 08:37.600
[jeering and shouting by inmates]

08:43.856 --> 08:46.484
[police siren]

09:03.376 --> 09:06.629
[Ruffo] <i>I know what JPR was feeling</i>
<i>as he left Jaraguara.</i>

09:07.004 --> 09:10.258
<i>First, relief just to be alive.</i>

09:17.640 --> 09:20.059
<i>Then, nostalgia.</i>

09:21.310 --> 09:25.898
<i>He missed his wife, his daughter,</i>
<i>his grandchildren.</i>

09:26.190 --> 09:27.483
<i>Even his son-in-law.</i>

09:28.067 --> 09:29.902
[thunder]

09:32.655 --> 09:35.408
<i>It's so hard staying away</i>
<i>from the people you love.</i>

09:35.866 --> 09:39.787
<i>But what's</i> <i>worse is to know that,</i>
<i>because of you</i>

09:39.870 --> 09:42.290
<i>those loved ones can end up</i>
<i>fucked forever.</i>

09:42.373 --> 09:45.251
I want an authorization
to go after his family.

09:45.334 --> 09:49.380
Jaraguara was the Public Prosecutor's
whole card and they got nothing at all.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.173
Now it's up to us to pick up the ball.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.051
And JPR is gonna have to talk,
with or without a plea bargain.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.636
He's gonna have to tell us.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.889
Give me the authorization
to speak to Rigo.

09:58.973 --> 09:59.974
That's all.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.435
OK, Verena. You got it. Go ahead.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.488
[Liana] Excuse me, judge.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.116
Verena Cardoni wants
to speak with you, sir. Law 12850/13.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.831
-Intent to conspire?
-Uh-huh.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.126
I can go after his daughter and
son-in-law. The law changed last year.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.796
It went from a minimum of four
down to three to form a conspiracy.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.881
I'm aware of the law.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.717
I need a warrant to search
his daughter's home now.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.928
He endured Jaraguara, huh?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.264
How could you authorize
something like that?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.434
I'm not responsible
for the Brazilian prison system.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.062
I feel responsible
for the life of the man I arrested.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.190
Will you  give me the warrant
to search his daughter's house?

10:55.780 --> 10:59.659
[Ruffo] <i>Would JPR keep his mouth shut</i>
<i>even if his family was being threatened?</i>

11:02.119 --> 11:03.871
<i>The path was clear.</i>

11:04.705 --> 11:07.792
<i>Verena and Rigo knew that damn well.</i>

11:08.167 --> 11:09.710
[doorbell buzzes]

11:13.464 --> 11:15.299
[doorbell buzzes]

11:18.135 --> 11:19.553
[doorbell buzzes]

11:24.266 --> 11:26.143
[doorbell buzzes]

11:34.902 --> 11:36.070
[she gasps]

11:36.153 --> 11:37.154
Ricky?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.656
[breathing loudly]

11:38.739 --> 11:41.200
Baby! The police are at the door.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.993
-What?
-[Shayenne] The police are here!

11:44.078 --> 11:47.289
-[Ricky] We have to open it.
-No, don't open it. We can't let them in.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.708
-Baby, we have to.
-We can't open it.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.461
Go put some clothes on.
I'll get dressed and we'll open it.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.423
-No.
-It will be OK. Don't worry.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.886
-Good morning, sir.
-[Ricky] Good morning.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.430
Ricardo Cordeiro Neto?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.098
[Ricky] Yes.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.519
[Vander] Would you follow me?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.770
No, wait...

12:09.854 --> 12:12.565
Can they just come in like that, Ricky?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.281
Where's the safe?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.909
-We don't have a safe in this house.
-Nothing like that.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.662
We don't have anything.
What are you looking for?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.372
-Calm down.
-What are they doing here?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.625
-They're looking around.
-Can they just barge in like that?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.545
-They can because they have a warrant.
-A warrant? What did we do?

12:34.628 --> 12:38.883
-They have a search warrant.
-What did we do that's so wrong?

12:38.966 --> 12:41.427
-[Verena] Conspiracy, ma'am.
-Conspiracy?

12:41.510 --> 12:44.513
The documents you took from
your father's office. Where are they?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.307
Call Agostini.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.391
Go, now!

12:48.017 --> 12:49.685
Why the hell are you doing this to us?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.145
FEDERAL POLICE

12:51.228 --> 12:53.105
[Vander] The articles of organization say

12:53.189 --> 12:56.775
the company is involved with management
consulting, executive training,

12:56.859 --> 12:59.361
and professionalizing family business.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.863
[Verena laughs]

13:00.946 --> 13:02.990
Professionalizing family business

13:03.073 --> 13:05.701
means laundering dad-in-law's money.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.661
[Vander] The company has about 30 clients.

13:10.664 --> 13:11.916
Oh, you'll like this one.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.920
Check it out.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.963
Petrobrasil.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.883
JPR's son-in-law does consulting
work for Petrobrasil?

13:20.966 --> 13:23.844
He lent over $1.9 million
to his father-in-law.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.514
Isn't it marvelous
how they do accounting for this stuff?

13:27.264 --> 13:29.475
-Son of a fucking bitch.
-Son of a fucking bitch.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.811
Well,

13:32.895 --> 13:35.314
Time to show the DA how it's done,
isn't it?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.677
[Rangel sobs] Hi, honey. How are you?

14:05.052 --> 14:06.345
[Shayenne] Hi, Dad.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.806
[Shayenne] They told me to make it quick.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.560
You ruined my life forever.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.396
[Rangel sobs]

14:15.479 --> 14:16.939
[Shayenne] But I have a son.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.110
Confess to everything immediately.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.864
It was all your doing.

14:26.782 --> 14:32.538
<i>Me and Ricky... my mother,</i>
<i>we didn't know about anything.</i>

14:32.621 --> 14:34.206
[Rangel sobs]

14:34.290 --> 14:36.709
[Shayenne] We just followed your orders.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.505
Put an end to this.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.965
[Rangel sobs]

14:45.885 --> 14:47.219
I'll take care of my mom.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.598
[Rangel sobs]

14:50.681 --> 14:51.932
[Rangel] <i>Honey...</i>

15:13.871 --> 15:16.081
[Ibrahim] Pepê?

15:25.132 --> 15:26.675
[Rangel] <i>My daughter was here.</i>

15:28.677 --> 15:30.846
They let the information get to my family.

15:31.430 --> 15:35.601
Some times stuff slips through,
but you're back here now.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.728
We're alone here, Ibrahim.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.648
They've totally forgotten us,
like we don't exist.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.066
[laughing] Yeah, like always.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.193
I'm going to talk.

15:45.861 --> 15:49.907
If they forget about my family, the hell
with it, I'll give them what they want.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.575
[Rangel sighs]

15:54.244 --> 15:56.664
One, it could be dangerous.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.832
What are they going to do? Kill me?
Who cares?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.795
It involves a lot of people,
you know that.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.217
And we're the only ones in here.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.971
Ibra, I'm sorry.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.850
I know you could hold out much longer,
but for me that's it. I'm done.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.770
[Ibrahim sighs]

16:22.523 --> 16:25.275
I don't have to tell you it's foolish.
You already know that.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.194
But...

16:28.529 --> 16:29.905
since you've decided...

16:31.281 --> 16:33.117
put a fair price on it.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.704
You're going to call your attorney
and ask him to arrange a plea bargain.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.081
That's exactly what the Prosecutor
is asking.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.167
-Although Agostini didn't like it.
-Of course he doesn't.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.379
A plea bargain for you
kills off his entire clientele, come on!

16:46.797 --> 16:47.631
Pepê!

16:49.466 --> 16:51.844
We're going to have to make
a deal with them, a good one.

16:52.928 --> 16:53.929
The two of us.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.142
-The two of us?
-If you talk, I have to talk too.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.729
The first one negotiates high.
Then we come down.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.275
You might ask, "How we get out of this?"

17:06.900 --> 17:09.987
You make out okay because
you know the theory.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.989
And I have the experience.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.450
The two of us together...

17:16.201 --> 17:18.454
we can blow open the whole thing.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.371
Pepê...

17:20.164 --> 17:21.248
you gotta be ready.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.251
You'll be dead to the world.
I'm not kidding.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.336
It won't be easy. Really.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.716
You think we could get them to release
my daughter? Even my son-in-law?

17:30.799 --> 17:33.594
We could even get a reduction
of sentence?

17:34.928 --> 17:36.180
[Ibrahim sighs]

17:36.263 --> 17:38.015
Look, Pepê, I don't know about you,

17:39.141 --> 17:40.934
but I don't want to do any time at all.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.274
-Give me your phone a second?
-You wanna call home?

17:47.357 --> 17:48.734
I'm firing Agostini.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.110
Go on.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.029
[laughing] He'll probably thank you.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.949
Who do you think comes first for him?
You or Club 13?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.581
[Ruffo] <i>The Wizard had</i>
<i>gathered the lawyers</i>

18:02.664 --> 18:06.126
<i>of the 13 richest and most corrupt</i>
<i>contractors in the country.</i>

18:07.377 --> 18:11.048
<i>If he could convince them to admit</i>
<i>their crimes</i>

18:11.131 --> 18:13.550
<i>and repay the nation,</i>
<i>at least symbolically,</i>

18:14.510 --> 18:17.429
<i>then JPR would explain everything</i>

18:17.513 --> 18:21.433
<i>and the operation would be buried</i>
<i>before it ever reached the politicians.</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:24.478
So, if that's the price
of halting the investigation,

18:24.561 --> 18:26.105
I find it fairly reasonable.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.107
And take the blame for what?

18:28.190 --> 18:29.900
I don't believe you!

18:29.983 --> 18:33.028
The Nobleman pays my fees
and he's not even on the same page as you!

18:33.612 --> 18:38.867
Rigo is turning out to be very persistent
and persuasive.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.913
Tom's authorized it and I'm pretty sure
the rest of the group is in agreement.

18:42.996 --> 18:43.997
We do.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.251
How did this investigation, a minor
local thing, manage to get this far?

18:47.334 --> 18:51.922
Let's reach a consensus on a number
for restitution that could be at least...

18:52.381 --> 18:53.549
viewed as symbolical.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.259
I'm in for whatever. Excuse me.

18:55.342 --> 19:00.013
If it's a restitution that's symbolic
and split between everyone, I can try.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.099
But I doubt Ricardo will agree to it.

19:02.683 --> 19:06.937
Let's try to reach a figure that's at
least correct in the order of magnitude.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.731
Careful about that magnitude.
The figure's got to be low.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.860
[woman] Yes, and no names
released to the public.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.070
Restitution is for those
who owe something.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.490
Well... Plea bargain in Curitiba.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.537
João Pedro and Ibrahim are going for it.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.998
Isn't João Pedro one of your clients?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.749
He was one of my clients.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.585
He just fired me now.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.422
[Mário] We must come to an agreement.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.801
I'll check
with the Attorney General's office.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.720
If you think he'd be receptive
to an agreement,

19:39.803 --> 19:42.764
we can arrange a meeting
and make sure everybody will be there

19:42.848 --> 19:44.099
and finalize the deal.

19:44.183 --> 19:48.520
I'll check with him. I'll go now.
I'll inform the Attorney General's office.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.189
[Mário breathes heavily]

19:50.272 --> 19:54.276
Restitution to be divided by you all.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.362
[Ruffo] <i>I don't know which bastard</i>
<i>was worst.</i>

19:57.446 --> 19:59.615
<i>The Wizard or Ibrahim.</i>

19:59.698 --> 20:03.160
<i>Ibrahim is a son of a bitch</i>
<i>of the highest order.</i>

20:03.243 --> 20:07.206
<i>He wanted to avoid prison</i>
<i>by piggybacking on JPR's plea bargain.</i>

20:07.289 --> 20:08.707
This is a peace mission.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.668
The Prosecutor's Office values peace.
Whenever possible.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.755
You're looking for some kind
of agreement, correct?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.423
That's what we all want.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.550
You're the one
who requested this meeting today.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.386
Very well. Cards on the table.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.724
I'm here to propose a joint agreement
for the two of them.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.436
-What do you mean "the two of them"?
-A double collaboration.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.814
A plea bargain for João Pedro
and Roberto Ibrahim.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.986
What do you think?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.864
-Two divergent. It won't work.
-[Motta] Actually it will.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.449
They're the same.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.160
One's information complements the other.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.704
They both confirm each other.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.375
So... those are my terms.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.752
It's both plea bargains
or none of them.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.589
Well... that's not how we work here.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.674
Thank you, sir.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.927
What are you proposing?

21:02.010 --> 21:04.096
-[Dimas] Cláudio?
-Let him talk.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.230
[Verena] What's going on?

21:14.022 --> 21:15.857
Where'd they send JPR this time?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.359
It's worse than that.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.445
The plea bargain.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.323
Dimas called. They made a deal
with both JPR and Ibrahim.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.908
-Together?
-Together.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.203
I'll be right back.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.588
[Verena] This is my operation!

21:38.672 --> 21:40.799
I found the evidence
and I arrested those guys!

21:40.882 --> 21:43.719
-[Dimas] It's the judicial system's.
-This way it's gonna be screwed.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.431
I just got back from JPR's daughter's
house, with a truckload of proof.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.850
We don't need to make a deal!
Can't we bust their asses?

21:49.933 --> 21:52.686
This will bring the investigation
to a whole different level.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.271
I didn't arrest them
for you to release them.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.940
We let the little fish go
to get the big fish, you know that.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.276
Ibrahim has over 100 years
sentence to do still.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.486
We have no clue how deeply
JPR is involved.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.031
They'll give back the real estate,
they'll pay fines--

22:04.114 --> 22:06.033
Bullshit! That's crap and you know it.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.243
We don't even know how much they are
stealing yet.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.120
It's a mistake, it's too soon.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.665
Plea bargaining is a perfectly
acceptable resource these days.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.959
Yeah, sure. Like he honored
the agreement last time? -He'll make you look like a fool.
-[Cláudio] Financial crime!

22:18.837 --> 22:20.964
You gather evidence for years
and there's no guarantee.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.132
That's how it works.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.383
[Cláudio inhales sharply]

22:23.467 --> 22:25.719
It's out of our hands.
I've already told Rigo.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.638
So, it's done and that's it?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.684
I'm not your enemy, Verena.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.478
No, Cláudio.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.854
You're much worse than that.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.079
[Ruffo] <i>I knew exactly</i>
<i>how Verena was feeling.</i>

22:53.163 --> 22:57.459
<i>JPR and Ibrahim would soon</i>
<i>both be released.</i>

22:58.418 --> 23:00.212
<i>But would they talk?</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:03.048
<i>Damn...</i>

23:04.132 --> 23:07.636
<i>Being a cop in the land of corruption</i>
<i>is fucking hard.</i>

23:15.060 --> 23:16.353
<i>It's a huge burden.</i>

23:17.562 --> 23:19.564
<i>Nobody can carry it alone.</i>

23:20.315 --> 23:22.442
[Verena gasps]

23:33.578 --> 23:34.454
Hey, Ruffo. Hi.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.213
[Verena laughs]

23:45.882 --> 23:48.385
[Verena] It never even occurred to me
to give it all up.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.014
This shit is tiring.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.141
[Ruffo] Ha.

23:54.224 --> 23:57.853
I have this feeling that everyone's
rooting for me to say that I give up,

23:57.936 --> 23:59.146
that I'm just too tired.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.773
[Ruffo] Yeah...

24:02.399 --> 24:04.359
They hate the ones
who don't get tired.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.112
-You never do.
-You don't either.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.322
Yeah...

24:10.615 --> 24:13.201
So... They hate us. Cheers!

24:13.285 --> 24:14.452
[Verena laughs]

24:20.083 --> 24:21.084
[Ruffo] I'm sorry.

24:23.128 --> 24:26.882
It's not that. I didn't do it because
I don't think you can do it on your own.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.925
It's because you can't stay away.
It's a problem.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.343
Yeah.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.221
It almost worked, too.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.600
Always the fucking DA's office.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.853
-It's always Cláudio.
-Yeah, always.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.023
[doorbell rings several times]

24:43.106 --> 24:44.649
-I'll get it.
-No.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.067
-No problem. I'll get it.
-You sure?

24:46.151 --> 24:47.319
I'm better.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.322
-[Verena] What's up?
-[Vander] Are you OK?

24:51.198 --> 24:52.199
I'm OK, and you?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.035
Hey.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.120
Make yourself at home.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.122
Figured you could use them.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.624
[Verena] Thanks.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.292
I didn't want to leave, you know.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.462
You should choose your friends better.
Come on in.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.965
-[Guilhome] He bosses me around.
-[Verena] He bosses me around, too.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.093
I don't boss anybody around,
not even at home.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.054
-I just try to help.
-[Verena] Ah.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.388
This is Vander, my right hand.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.641
-You know Ruffo.
-The Great Ruffo.

25:17.724 --> 25:18.558
[Ruffo] Vander.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.977
-[Guilhome] Here you go.
-Thanks.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.062
[Guilhome] Master!

25:22.562 --> 25:25.232
Guilhome...

25:27.067 --> 25:28.693
[jazz music plays over stereo]

25:28.777 --> 25:29.986
Mmm.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.155
Do you think they're gonna release
those rats or not?

25:32.864 --> 25:34.199
Yes, sooner or later.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.284
Seems like sooner.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.580
Well... a toast to all of us,

25:40.664 --> 25:42.832
fucking crazy enough to do this job.

25:42.916 --> 25:47.045
-You'd rather work for the DA's office?
-[Ruffo] Not at all!

25:56.805 --> 25:59.140
Mr. João Pedro...

26:00.517 --> 26:03.061
would you tell us how
this whole thing came to be?

26:03.812 --> 26:05.188
How it all came to be? Well...

26:05.689 --> 26:06.898
[Rangel laughs]

26:07.816 --> 26:11.987
It all began in 1808,
when King John VI first came to Brazil.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.321
I'm serious, really.

26:14.197 --> 26:17.784
At the time, it was the merchants
and slave traders that ruled the country.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.245
All the money was theirs.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.789
And there was one, the richest one,

26:23.248 --> 26:26.376
his name was Elias Antônio Lopes,
I believe.

26:26.960 --> 26:31.631
Realizing that the city had very little
to offer the visiting monarch,

26:32.090 --> 26:36.469
he ceded the Quinta da Boa Vista Estate
for the King and all his family.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.305
That's how it started, really.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.516
In exchange, he received
the Military Order of Christ.

26:41.599 --> 26:44.436
He became Notary Public
and Clerk of Paraty.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.858
The Lord of Tiradentes, Knight
of the Royal House, Governor, and more.

26:50.233 --> 26:55.655
Even more important, he became broker
and provider of the Court's insurance,

26:55.739 --> 26:59.868
and responsible for the collection
of taxes in several locations.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.789
That's the long tradition
that brought us here now.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.834
Actually, that's the part
I'm already familiar with.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.338
Perhaps you could tell me
something I don't know?

27:11.421 --> 27:13.298
[Rangel] Perhaps I could tell you that

27:13.381 --> 27:19.220
nowadays the courts in Brazil
are financed by the major contractors.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.477
[Ibrahim] Yes, there's
a Supply Department,

27:25.560 --> 27:29.105
but JPR isn't the only director involved
in the scheme.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.690
There are other departments, too.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.401
[Cláudio] And which departments
are involved?

27:33.902 --> 27:37.739
Well, there's Services
who feeds the majority party.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.033
Were you operating for them as well?

27:40.116 --> 27:42.285
No. That's the treasurer of the party.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.746
[Cláudio] Anyone else?

27:44.829 --> 27:48.291
-[Ibrahim] Dept. of International Affairs.
-They also fed the government's party?

27:48.375 --> 27:51.711
No, that department feeds
the coalition party,

27:51.795 --> 27:53.254
the party of the vice-president.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.091
[Verena] <i>Every company</i>
<i>contracting with Petrobrasil</i>

27:56.174 --> 27:59.344
pays 1% to the Supply department
and 1% to Services.

27:59.427 --> 28:02.347
<i>There are three divisions taking</i>
<i>an active part in the scheme.</i>

28:02.430 --> 28:06.393
<i>They feed directly into both</i>
<i>the government and the coalition parties.</i>

28:06.643 --> 28:07.477
OK.

28:09.062 --> 28:13.316
I'm not the mentor of this thing,
nor the head of the scam.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.484
There are much bigger names.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.779
[Cláudio] <i>What do you mean</i>
<i>by "bigger names"?</i>

28:18.738 --> 28:21.324
[Ibrahim] <i>People above</i>
<i>Petrobrasil's board of directors.</i>

28:21.783 --> 28:22.617
[Cláudio] <i>Who?</i>

28:23.493 --> 28:26.121
Top bureaucrats, politicians.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.416
Did you attend any gatherings
where these politicians were present?

28:29.499 --> 28:32.335
Sure, politicians, builders.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.295
[phone ringing]

28:36.506 --> 28:38.174
There were meetings all the time.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.428
It was very organized,
everything was registered.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.429
we kept minutes.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.055
-Minutes?
-[Ibrahim] Yeah.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.766
We kept detailed minutes
of all business.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.937
That way everybody had the information,
even those who couldn't make it.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.188
Who's everybody?

28:52.272 --> 28:56.192
Oh... the presidency of Petrobrasil,
Planalto Palace.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.237
What do you mean by the "Planalto Palace"?

28:59.821 --> 29:02.532
Chief of Staff, Mines and Energy,

29:02.615 --> 29:03.908
the president of the Republic.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.326
[phone ringing]

29:05.410 --> 29:08.246
[voicemail] <i>The number you have called</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

29:08.329 --> 29:10.248
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

29:10.331 --> 29:11.458
[voicemail beeps]

29:11.541 --> 29:14.335
Verena, I'm trying to reach you.
Call me, it's urgent.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.714
There were plenty of power struggles
between all the parties

29:17.797 --> 29:20.341
to see which one
would get the department they wanted.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.511
And it was the Planalto
that settled the disputes.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.138
The Planalto Palace?

29:28.016 --> 29:30.268
Can you give me some names?

29:35.231 --> 29:39.068
Ex-President João Higino,
President Janete...

29:39.652 --> 29:40.612
Dudinha.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.156
The Secretary of--

29:43.239 --> 29:48.453
Sorry, are you affirming that Janete
and Higino knew everything?

29:50.330 --> 29:53.166
[Ruffo] <i>Roberto Ibrahim cooperating</i>
<i>with the authorities?</i>

29:57.545 --> 30:00.006
<i>Fuck, I should have seen it coming.</i>

30:00.340 --> 30:01.174
Yeah.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.469
Higino and Janete knew about it all.

30:05.512 --> 30:06.638
They knew everything.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.268
[Ruffo] <i>That prick never made a move</i>
<i>without a reason.</i>

30:15.063 --> 30:16.689
<i>But in that moment,</i>

30:17.232 --> 30:20.068
<i>the Prosecutor's tactic was working.</i>

30:21.194 --> 30:22.403
<i>The guys were talking.</i>

30:23.321 --> 30:24.823
<i>Even I was in the mood to celebrate.</i>

30:25.824 --> 30:29.035
<i>But celebrating meant</i>
<i>applauding Cláudio.</i>

30:29.494 --> 30:32.288
<i>Nope, not in this lifetime.</i>

30:32.372 --> 30:33.456
Sheriff.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.376
-Been a long time.
-Yeah, long time.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.628
Ever since you released Ibrahim.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.505
You're gonna do it again, right?

30:40.588 --> 30:42.173
You mean the plea bargain?

30:42.549 --> 30:44.676
It's been a very effective tool,
hasn't it, Verena?

30:44.759 --> 30:47.053
I bet it is. For the bad guys.
They love it.

30:47.136 --> 30:50.640
Our deals turned out really well.
Ask Verena, she'll tell you.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.934
You're the bad guys' hero
giving autographs and shit?

30:53.017 --> 30:54.185
Let's go over here to talk.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.729
You're exposing me!

30:57.647 --> 30:58.773
What's going on?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.525
Nothing, he's still out of his mind.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.652
Things have changed.
Times are different now.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.529
-You've changed.
-The laws have changed!

31:04.612 --> 31:07.073
-[Ruffo] You've changed.
-The agreement is in our favor.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.324
You were convinced by Cláudio.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.451
They are giving in.
It's way bigger than we thought.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.079
I'm going. They can deal with each other.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.957
-I thought you wanted to get a drink?
-I'm tired, I'm going home.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.293
All right, fine.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.670
-Ibrahim says they knew about it all.
-Who?

31:20.753 --> 31:22.505
-Ruscov and João Higino.
-Ibrahim told you?

31:22.589 --> 31:25.174
It's in his testimony. They both knew.

31:36.936 --> 31:39.147
[man laughs, woman pants]

31:39.230 --> 31:40.565
[Verena] Hey!

31:48.698 --> 31:50.867
Go on...

31:50.950 --> 31:53.286
-Admit it.
-What?

31:53.369 --> 31:54.746
Admit that I was right.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.123
-[both laugh]
-[Cláudio] Say it.

32:01.794 --> 32:02.921
-[Verena] Admit it.
-[Cláudio] What?

32:03.004 --> 32:04.964
[Verena] You're in love.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.261
-[Verena] Cláudio!
-Keep it down!

32:10.345 --> 32:11.346
Keep it down!

32:25.276 --> 32:26.611
[kissing]

32:57.976 --> 32:59.435
[brakes squeal]

32:59.519 --> 33:02.063
GÓRGONA PUBLISHERS

33:19.914 --> 33:21.874
<i>READ IT</i>
THEY KNEW IT ALL

33:21.958 --> 33:23.459
[cellphone beeps]

33:26.963 --> 33:28.339
TO: IBRAHIM

33:28.423 --> 33:30.842
SCORE! THE ARTICLE CAME OUT BETTER
THAN PLANNED

33:30.925 --> 33:32.343
YOU'LL GET A COPY.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.054
Good morning.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.728
[Ibrahim laughs] THEY KNEW IT ALL

33:48.401 --> 33:50.236
[Ruffo] Fucking hell!

33:50.820 --> 33:52.030
Who could've leaked it?

33:52.530 --> 33:54.824
[Cláudio] If it wasn't you, Dimas or me...

33:54.907 --> 33:56.826
[Verena] Are you sure
it wasn't you, Cláudio?

33:57.368 --> 34:00.204
I set up the plea bargain.
What would I gain?

34:00.288 --> 34:01.748
It was Ibrahim and his lawyer.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.791
[Guilhome] What's he gain by it

34:03.875 --> 34:06.627
Mess with the evidence, screw
the operation, fuck the police.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.670
[Ibrahim laughs]

34:08.755 --> 34:09.755
This is too good!

34:09.839 --> 34:11.215
It's right before the elections.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.676
They want to sell it like
the whole operation is biased.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.011
That we're against the government.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.639
There's far too big a lead.
There's no way for us to turn it around--

34:18.723 --> 34:20.516
Will you please just shut up, Andrea?

34:20.600 --> 34:23.518
This will have a big impact
on the elections for sure.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.898
Of course it's desperation!
It's clearly ideological.

34:26.981 --> 34:31.027
They lost their bearings and we're
gonna turn it around on our favor.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.112
I love this magazine.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.572
And this magazine loves me.

34:35.656 --> 34:37.449
The tables have turned.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.870
I'll have to call and thank
the managing editor.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.246
He's a great man!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.873
[Ruffo] <i>The plea bargain leak</i>
<i>exploded like a bomb.</i>

34:44.956 --> 34:49.587
<i>And the opposition candidate, who was</i>
<i>dead in the water, started swimming.</i>

34:49.670 --> 34:51.380
Breakfast of the bravest.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.547
Infallible recipe.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.384
[Ruffo] <i>He pounced like a lion.</i>

34:55.467 --> 34:57.595
<i>accusing the government of corruption.</i>

34:58.846 --> 35:00.556
<i>But he was corrupt, too.</i>

35:01.057 --> 35:04.769
I, like every other Brazilian citizen,
demand exemplary punishment

35:04.852 --> 35:06.145
for all those involved.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.064
[Ruffo] <i>The more he talked,</i>

35:08.147 --> 35:12.443
<i>the more the government sold the idea</i>
<i>that Jet Wash was politically motivated.</i>

35:12.527 --> 35:17.323
I find it strange and appalling that this
kind of disclosure is coming up now,

35:17.406 --> 35:21.536
trying to discredit the government right
in the middle of the electoral season.

35:21.619 --> 35:24.580
[Ruffo] <i>This freak show was just</i>
<i>what Ibrahim wanted.</i>

35:24.872 --> 35:27.250
[Ruffo] <i>To put the Federal Police</i>
<i>under suspicion...</i>

35:27.583 --> 35:30.920
<i>so the government could happily</i>
<i>bury the investigation.</i>

35:32.130 --> 35:33.506
[Carvalho] So, Mr. President...

35:34.882 --> 35:37.009
what do you think about this apartment?

35:41.264 --> 35:44.976
You know I'm not the one who makes
the decision of this kind of thing.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.105
[on phone] Mário Garcez?

35:49.689 --> 35:51.149
The deal has to go through.

35:52.233 --> 35:56.571
There's no reason. Tom Carvalho
is here too and he agrees with me.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.447
<i>We need to speed things up.</i>

35:58.531 --> 35:59.615
I will.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.160
But you also need to speak to Janete.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.788
It's an opportunity to change
the head of the Federal Police.

36:06.873 --> 36:09.041
These leaks are a serious situation.

36:09.625 --> 36:12.628
<i>Remember</i>, <i>we don't get a chance</i>
<i>like this every day.</i>

36:12.712 --> 36:15.631
[Ruffo] <i>Making the Feds look</i>
<i>responsible for the leaks</i>

36:15.715 --> 36:18.134
<i>was all Higino needed</i>
<i>to bury the operation.</i>

36:18.217 --> 36:20.553
You need to make her understand that.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.138
[Ruffo] <i>The Wizard got that.</i>

36:23.764 --> 36:25.933
<i>But I got that first.</i>

36:35.860 --> 36:37.486
FEDERAL POLICE

36:55.796 --> 36:57.006
[bangs table]

36:57.089 --> 36:57.924
Bingo!

36:58.341 --> 37:00.927
[Ruffo] <i>Remember the guard</i>
<i>Guilhome caught helping the rats?</i>

37:01.636 --> 37:04.472
<i>He was the one supplying</i>
<i>cell phones to Ibrahim.</i>

37:05.514 --> 37:08.768
<i>So guess who supplied</i>
<i>the cell phones to the guard?</i>

37:09.393 --> 37:13.356
<i>Yep. The little smart ones always fuck up.</i>

37:13.439 --> 37:15.399
THE ARTICLE CAME OUT
BETTER THAN PLANNED.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.484
YOU'LL GET A COPY.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.320
They ended up being useful.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.990
At least it proves we didn't leak
the information to <i>Read It</i> Magazine.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.868
Read it but don't believe it.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.578
[Ruffo laughs]

37:29.747 --> 37:30.748
Good job.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.216
[Ruffo] <i>The next day... Boom!</i>
<i>It was in all the papers:</i>

37:41.342 --> 37:44.804
<i>"Roberto Ibrahim leaked the plea bargain</i>
<i>to sabotage Jet Wash."</i>
