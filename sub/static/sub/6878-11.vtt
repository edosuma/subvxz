05:39.173 --> 05:40.381
Well, one out of two

05:39.173 --> 05:40.381
isn't bad.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.259
[laughter]

05:42.301 --> 05:44.886
And I'm ready for

05:42.301 --> 05:44.886
a fresh start.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.809
Well, then I guess

05:47.055 --> 05:50.809
it's unanimous.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.936
We'll miss you.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.403
God, it's so weird coming home

05:59.693 --> 06:02.403
in the same clothes

06:02.445 --> 06:03.446
I went out with.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
It's so "Orange Is

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
the New Black."

06:05.115 --> 06:06.825
Mm-hmm.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.952
And--and coming home

06:06.867 --> 06:08.952
to the same dishes

06:08.994 --> 06:10.411
that were out when I left.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.914
It's okay.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.914
What's this?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.166
Happy birthday.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.210
From Rize Bakery,

06:14.208 --> 06:16.210
straight to your stomach.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.213
That is so sweet.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.423
I mean, cake first thing

06:19.254 --> 06:22.423
in the morning,

06:22.465 --> 06:23.591
that's a little--

06:22.465 --> 06:23.591
maybe later.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.720
Psycho, put the cleaning

06:23.633 --> 06:26.720
supplies down, okay?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.681
Doctor Toughlove says

06:26.761 --> 06:29.681
you need to feed yourself,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.558
so take advantage,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.558
sister.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.852
Sit your skinny ass down.

06:33.894 --> 06:38.190
Yes, and lucky you, you actually

06:33.894 --> 06:38.190
need to eat something.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.235
- Yeah.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.235
- And Scott's cake...

06:41.276 --> 06:43.945
needs to be eaten.

06:43.987 --> 06:44.863
That sounded so wrong.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.281
[chuckles]

06:46.323 --> 06:48.325
How is it with Scott after

06:46.323 --> 06:48.325
the whole couch incident?

06:48.367 --> 06:49.408
Is that gonna be weird?

06:49.450 --> 06:50.202
Eh, Scott and I

06:49.450 --> 06:50.202
are always kinda cool.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.494
Yeah?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.494

06:51.536 --> 06:54.206
A good dry hump doesn't

06:51.536 --> 06:54.206
have to be all feels, Abs.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.498
Right.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.835
It's like working out

06:55.540 --> 06:58.835
together, only less boring.

06:58.877 --> 06:59.920
[both chuckle]

06:59.961 --> 07:03.340
Yeah, you keep telling

06:59.961 --> 07:03.340

07:03.382 --> 07:06.009
- Oh, crap, no.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.009
- What? What?

07:06.051 --> 07:08.929
Kat is texting me

07:06.051 --> 07:08.929
the jacket copy,

07:08.970 --> 07:10.889
but this cannot go in

07:08.970 --> 07:10.889

07:10.931 --> 07:12.849
Look at this

07:10.931 --> 07:12.849
Face of Divorce.

07:12.891 --> 07:17.145
I mean, could the photo be

07:12.891 --> 07:17.145
any closer up?

07:17.187 --> 07:19.814
You T-Zone looks

07:17.187 --> 07:19.814
kind of fracked.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.817
Yeah. Random House can't

07:19.856 --> 07:22.817

07:22.859 --> 07:26.363
Kind of fracked.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.363
Yeah.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.488

07:27.530 --> 07:29.616
You're supposed to be chilling

07:27.530 --> 07:29.616
and eating.

07:29.657 --> 07:30.617
I know. I'm writing--

07:30.658 --> 07:31.576
Chilling and eating.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.702
I am writing

07:31.618 --> 07:32.702
a quick to-do list,

07:32.744 --> 07:33.954
and as soon

07:32.744 --> 07:33.954
as these things are done,

07:33.995 --> 07:37.457
I am going to take to bed

07:33.995 --> 07:37.457
for, like, a week.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.792
It's gonna be

07:37.498 --> 07:38.792
like a bed-in.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.586
It's gonna be like

07:38.833 --> 07:41.586
John and Yoko, only just Yoko.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.630
Did the words "brain smash"

07:41.628 --> 07:43.630
not register with you?

07:43.671 --> 07:47.467
Hey, no, Kat is waiting

07:43.671 --> 07:47.467
for catalogue copy

07:47.508 --> 07:48.969
and photo approval.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.971
I need to get into

07:49.010 --> 07:50.971
the fall catalogue,

07:51.012 --> 07:52.513
or they will hold my book

07:51.012 --> 07:52.513
until spring.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.932
Let them.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.932
Take a freaking break.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
I can't, Jo.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
I cannot.

Things change.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.021
What if divorce goes away

08:00.063 --> 08:01.982
and suddenly

08:00.063 --> 08:01.982
it's trans-polyamory?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.942
I cannot reinvent myself

08:02.023 --> 08:03.942
again.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.860
I am so close

08:03.984 --> 08:05.860
to being done.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.904
I just need to finish

08:05.902 --> 08:07.904
my book this week

08:07.946 --> 08:09.864
and--and pack up Becca's

08:07.946 --> 08:09.864
baby things

08:09.906 --> 08:11.950
and tell the kids they're not

08:09.906 --> 08:11.950
getting a baby brother,

08:11.992 --> 08:15.495
and order a limo

08:11.992 --> 08:15.495
for Delia's bachelorette.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.123
Abby, put the phone down.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.209
that after all of this is done--

08:21.251 --> 08:23.420
- I will decompress.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.420
- I will totally decompress.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.471

08:30.927 --> 08:32.471
- Oh, no. Oh, sorry.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.597
The--the one after that.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.017
- "Learn to meditate."

08:34.639 --> 08:37.017
- Right? Come on.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.016
- Thank you.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.016
- Look around.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.311
Enjoy the fierce abs, Abs.

25:20.353 --> 25:23.772
Sorry.

25:20.353 --> 25:23.772
I am tabling it.

25:23.814 --> 25:24.857
I am cutting loose.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.151
- Yes, cutting loose, honey.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.151
- Whoo!

25:27.193 --> 25:29.195
Behold, ladies,

25:27.193 --> 25:29.195
the Red Room,

25:29.236 --> 25:31.364
which I like to call

25:29.236 --> 25:31.364
"The Bedroom,"

25:31.405 --> 25:33.157
because sexy never sleeps.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.283
You know what I'm saying?

25:34.325 --> 25:36.534
[both laugh]

25:36.576 --> 25:38.620
Hey, ladies, who's up for

25:36.576 --> 25:38.620
some whipped cream shots?

25:38.662 --> 25:41.207
- Whippets!

25:38.662 --> 25:41.207
- So retro.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.210
Throwback to my high school

25:41.248 --> 25:44.210
football field, I have to say.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.462
- Yes.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.462
- There you go.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.298
I don't want to think.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.298
There's no thinking tonight.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.757
No, all the things--

25:50.799 --> 25:52.176
[laughing]

25:52.218 --> 25:55.262
I'm not gonna have any house

25:52.218 --> 25:55.262
things, any kids things,

25:55.304 --> 25:57.555
any baby things, any Tay-be

25:55.304 --> 25:57.555
things, any Harris things.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.308
That's a lot of things

25:57.597 --> 25:59.308
to not think about, Abs.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.642
You know,

25:59.350 --> 26:00.642
we're gonna have fun.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.145
I am a free bird tonight.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.480
JD? What happened?

26:04.522 --> 26:05.814
I was this delicate

26:04.522 --> 26:05.814
little flower,

26:05.856 --> 26:08.108
and I pushed him too hard,

26:05.856 --> 26:08.108
whatever.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.651
I'm kind of relieved.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.112
He was sweet

26:09.693 --> 26:12.112
but a little bit of a weirdo.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.199
Well, not all of us

26:12.154 --> 26:15.199
can date a CNN star

26:15.241 --> 26:18.411
five minutes after her husband

26:15.241 --> 26:18.411
really becomes her ex-husband.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.246
Did we not just talk about

26:20.287 --> 26:22.164
not getting into our shit

26:20.287 --> 26:22.164
tonight?

26:22.206 --> 26:24.333
- Yes.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.333
- No, no. Phoebe's right.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.501
Thank you.

26:25.543 --> 26:28.295
I mean, I really was trying

26:25.543 --> 26:28.295
to leapfrog.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.297
But Harris can be

26:28.337 --> 26:30.297
very confusing.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.840
I mean, he's a sexy TV doctor.

26:31.882 --> 26:36.220
"I'm Harris. Watch me battle

26:31.882 --> 26:36.220
germs with my blinding smile."

26:36.262 --> 26:39.390
He was like a line drawing

26:36.262 --> 26:39.390
of a person.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.558
That's the laughing gas

26:39.432 --> 26:40.558
talking.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.101
All right, talk away,

26:42.142 --> 26:43.852
'cause I'm gonna see if there's

26:42.142 --> 26:43.852
a line in the Footsy Room.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.604
Oh.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.775
Jo, you don't look like

26:46.646 --> 26:49.775
you're having enough fun.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.152
I'm gonna hook you up.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.780
I'm gonna hook a bitch up.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.780
What?

26:54.821 --> 26:56.907
- Cowboy!

26:54.821 --> 26:56.907
- Yeah?

26:56.949 --> 26:59.285
Can I lasso you over here

26:56.949 --> 26:59.285
for my friend?

26:59.326 --> 27:02.329
Come here.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.329
She loves cowboys. [laughs]

27:02.371 --> 27:06.208
- Oh, my God.

27:02.371 --> 27:06.208
- Uh-oh.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.336
- Whoa!

27:06.250 --> 27:09.336
- Whoo, yeah!

27:09.378 --> 27:11.338
- Yeah.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.338
- [laughs]

27:11.380 --> 27:15.008

- [laughing]

27:20.973 --> 27:24.059
- Oh, yeah.

27:24.101 --> 27:27.771
- Oh, my God!

27:24.101 --> 27:27.771
- Okay, get off. Get off.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.899
I asked for a dance,

27:27.813 --> 27:30.899
not a face assault.

27:30.941 --> 27:33.527
Okay, you know, Jo,

27:30.941 --> 27:33.527
I think that's just part

27:33.569 --> 27:34.528
of his cowboy routine, but...

27:34.570 --> 27:36.363
Let's get some candies

27:34.570 --> 27:36.363
for the baby.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.031
Oh, let's get you

27:36.405 --> 27:38.031
another drink.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.200
What'd I miss?

27:40.242 --> 27:42.369
- It's all about Delia.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.369
- Whoo!

27:42.411 --> 27:44.413
Oh, my God.

27:44.455 --> 27:48.041
We should be doing body shots

27:44.455 --> 27:48.041

about the mess I made,

30:35.709 --> 30:38.170
but no, you couldn't

I'm sorry, okay?

30:39.505 --> 30:42.132
I'm sorry that I spoke up

30:39.505 --> 30:42.132
at an inconvenient time.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.343
"An inconvenient time"?

Yes, upon reflection,

30:44.384 --> 30:46.428
very.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.388
But can you please consider

30:48.430 --> 30:49.640
that what I'm saying

30:48.430 --> 30:49.640
may be true--

30:49.682 --> 30:53.101
that you would not be

30:49.682 --> 30:53.101

30:53.143 --> 30:55.354
if you were being honest

30:53.143 --> 30:55.354
with yourself about Gordon.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.980
You barely know Gordon.

He's a wonderful...

30:59.775 --> 31:01.610
charming...

31:01.652 --> 31:02.569
manipulator.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.280
And he is--

31:02.611 --> 31:05.280
he pulls your strings.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.824
How?

31:05.322 --> 31:06.824
By spoiling me?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.575
By making me feel loved?

31:08.617 --> 31:10.035
Delia,

31:08.617 --> 31:10.035
I know Gordon loves you.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.162
I really do.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.162
I know he loves you.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.332
But the price is that

31:12.204 --> 31:15.332
he calls all the shots.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.543
Like this whole wedding.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.546
Albert was your cry
