WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:05.798
- Wait up.
- Yeah, you should keep up.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.682
I can keep up.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.761
Whoa!

00:10.969 --> 00:11.720
Neato!

00:12.763 --> 00:14.731
Mysterious,
boarded-up cave.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.900
It might be filled with
lost prehistoric life forms.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.316
Or Mesoamerican gold.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.772
Uh, ladies first.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.198
[both giggling]

00:25.817 --> 00:28.991
Ha ha! Good thing you've
got your smarts, Poindexter.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.573
I've got the other thing.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.500
What is it called?
Oh, right, punching.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.463
Cool. Splinters.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.007
Whoa! It's
so creepy in here.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.375
Hey, don't worry, bro.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.051
Wherever we go,
we go together.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.846
Don't forget to leave our names
so they know who owns the place.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.637
Pines, Pines,
Pines, Pines.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.562
Finally, after all
these long years of waiting,

01:38.765 --> 01:40.358
you're actually here.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.274
Brother!

01:44.438 --> 01:46.782
Ow! What the heck
was that for?

01:46.982 --> 01:49.451
This was an insanely
risky move,

01:49.651 --> 01:51.198
restarting the portal.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.863
Didn't you read
my warnings?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.448
Warnings, schmarnings.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.283
How's about maybe
a thanks for saving you

01:56.491 --> 01:57.868
from what appears to be,
I don't know,

01:58.076 --> 02:00.670
<i>some kinda sci-ii
sideburn dimension.</i>

02:00.871 --> 02:03.124
Thank you? You really think
I'm gonna thank you

02:03.332 --> 02:05.209
after what you did
30 years ago?

02:05.417 --> 02:06.543
What I did?

02:06.752 --> 02:08.345
Why, you ungrateful...

02:10.505 --> 02:12.758
Don't expect me
to go easy on you

02:12.966 --> 02:14.764
just because
you're family.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.141
Hey, hi.
Mabel here.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.222
Quick question.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.432
What the heck
is going on here?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.690
Stan, you didn't tell me
there were children down here.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.613
And some sort of
large, hairless gopher.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.315
Ha ha, I get that a lot.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.280
They're your family,
Poindexter.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.819
Shermy's grand kids.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.871
I have a niece,
and a nephew?

02:35.405 --> 02:37.783
Greetings. Do kids
still say greetings?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.335
I haven't been in this dimension
for a really long time.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.458
Whoa, six-fingered
handshake.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.665
It's a full finger
friendlier than normal.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.046
Ha ha, I like this kid.
She's weird.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.211
I... I can't believe it.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.638
You're the author
of the journals.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.640
You've read
my journals?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.558
I haven't just read them.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.136
I've lived them.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.891
I've been waiting
for so long to meet you.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.848
I don't know what to say.
I have so many questions.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.066
[hyperventilating]

03:03.266 --> 03:04.893
I think I'm gonna
throw up.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.687
No, no, false alarm.

03:07.979 --> 03:08.821
Just gotta ride it out.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.195
Listen, there'll be time
for introductions later.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.777
But first, tell me, Stan.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.736
Are there any
security breaches?

03:14.945 --> 03:17.039
Does anyone else
know about this portal?

03:17.239 --> 03:18.741
No. Just us.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.792
Also, maybe the entire
U.S. government.

03:20.992 --> 03:21.914
The what?!

03:22.119 --> 03:23.792
<i>Fan out. We're not
going anywhere</i>

03:23.995 --> 03:26.965
<i>till we find Stan Pines
and those kids.</i>

03:27.624 --> 03:28.750
Okay. It's all right.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.087
We've got a while before
they find this room.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.763
We just need to lay low
and think of a plan.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.721
It looks like we're
stuck down here for a while.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.557
Who wants to tell us their
entire mysterious backstory?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.894
Yes, I have some questions
about all this myself, Stanley.

03:43.807 --> 03:44.558
Stanley?

03:44.766 --> 03:46.689
But your name
is Stanford.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.687
Wait, you took my name?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.693
What have you been doing all
these years, you knucklehead?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.820
Yeah, Grunkle Stan,
no more lies.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.196
You owe us some answers.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.611
What's the deal
with this portal?

03:55.819 --> 03:56.991
Why did you keep
this a secret?

03:57.195 --> 03:59.163
And what happened
between you and your brother?

03:59.322 --> 04:02.041
I'm hoping all this aligns
exactly with my fan-fic, Stan.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.498
If not, I will be
very disappointed.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.920
Okay. Okay, okay.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.706
I know I have
a lot of explaining to do.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.292
It all started
a lifetime ago.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.669
<i>1960-something.</i>

04:12.878 --> 04:14.721
<i>Glass Shard Beach,
New Jersey.</i>

04:15.422 --> 04:17.891
<i>I lived with my ma and pa
in the Lead Paint district</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:19.216
<i>above the family pawn shop.</i>

04:19.426 --> 04:20.848
<i>Dad was a strict man.</i>

04:21.052 --> 04:23.225
<i>Tough as a cinder block,
and not easily impressed.</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:24.431
I'm not impressed.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.358
<i>Mom was
a pathological liar,</i>

04:26.600 --> 04:28.568
<i>which served her well
as a phone psychic.</i>

04:28.769 --> 04:30.396
That'll be 99 cents
an hour.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.277
No, you're overpriced.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.074
Yeah, I predicted
you were gonna hang up.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.242
<i>And then, there was
my nerdy twin brother Stanford.</i>

04:36.401 --> 04:38.654
<i>As if his abnormally high
IQ wasn't enough,</i>

04:38.862 --> 04:40.455
<i>he also had
a rare birth defect--</i>

04:40.864 --> 04:42.286
<i>six fingers on each hand,</i>

04:42.491 --> 04:43.663
<i>which might've explained
his obsession</i>

04:43.867 --> 04:46.336
<i>with sci-fi
mystery weirdness.</i>

04:46.536 --> 04:50.166
<i>As for me, I had what Mom
liked to call personality.</i>

04:52.501 --> 04:53.593
<i>But as different
as we were,</i>

04:53.794 --> 04:55.421
<i>we were the perfect team,</i>

04:55.670 --> 04:57.172
<i>and every day,
we'd wander the beach,</i>

04:57.506 --> 04:58.803
<i>looking for adventure.</i>

05:00.258 --> 05:00.929
Whoa!

05:04.596 --> 05:06.064
A shipwrecked sailboat.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.686
Possibly haunted by
pirate ghosts.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.859
This is the greatest
thing I've ever seen.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.188
And I once saw a dead rat
floating in a bucket.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.989
[laughing]
Ew. What's wrong with you?

05:15.190 --> 05:17.659
Huh. You know what
this thing's missing?

05:18.401 --> 05:19.277
Flags.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.080
[both] Kings of New Jersey,
kings of New Jersey,

05:22.239 --> 05:23.991
kings of New Jersey!

05:27.160 --> 05:29.959
I dub thee
the Stan O' War.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.710
Ow! What the heck?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.713
Well, well, if it ain't
the loser twins.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.716
Nice boat. You get it
at the dump?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.547
[giggles]

05:38.755 --> 05:41.099
You would know,
Crampelter. Get lost!

05:41.299 --> 05:42.846
Listen, dorks,
and listen good.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.724
You're
a six-fingered freak,

05:44.928 --> 05:47.681
and you're just a dumber,
sweatier version of him.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.186
And you're lucky
you have each other,

05:49.391 --> 05:51.644
because neither of you
will ever make any friends.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.775
[laughing]

05:53.979 --> 05:55.902
Dorks
and losers.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.943
Hey, don't let
those idiots get to you.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.744
But I am a freak.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.822
I just wonder if there's
anywhere in the world

06:04.030 --> 06:05.748
where weirdos like me
fit in.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.543
Hey, chin up, buddy.
Look.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.620
One of these days,
you and me are gonna

06:10.829 --> 06:12.206
sail away from
this dumb town.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.382
We'll hunt for treasure,
get all the girls,

06:14.583 --> 06:17.587
and be an unstoppable
team of adventurers.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.966
You really mean it?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.298
- High six?
- High six.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.221
<i>Those were the good times.</i>

06:24.426 --> 06:25.803
<i>Those bullies may have
been right about us</i>

06:26.011 --> 06:28.355
<i>not making many friends,
but when push comes to shove,</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:30.523
<i>you only really need one.</i>

06:35.687 --> 06:38.031
<i>Ford's brain seemed to get
more impressive every year.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:40.279
<i>So did our pet project.</i>

06:40.442 --> 06:42.945
<i>Sure, I got in more than
my fair share of trouble,</i>

06:43.153 --> 06:44.826
<i>but when your brother's
the smartest kid in school,</i>

06:45.030 --> 06:46.873
<i>you've always got a leg up
on the competition.</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:52.666
<i>The future was looking
bright for both of us,</i>

06:53.580 --> 06:55.048
<i>till one day.</i>

06:56.541 --> 06:58.214
<i>[ Woman over P.A.] Pines twins
to the principal's office.</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:00.216
<i>Pines twins to
the principal's office.</i>

07:00.420 --> 07:02.343
Ah, great.
What is it this time?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.265
Not you. Him.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.058
Now, Mr. Pines, I'd like to
speak with you

07:13.266 --> 07:14.734
very frankly,
if I may.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.154
Very frankly
is the only way I speak.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.321
You have two sons.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.023
One of them
is incredibly gifted.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.734
The other one is standing outside this
room, and his name's Stanley.

07:23.902 --> 07:24.869
What are you saying?

07:25.070 --> 07:27.493
I'm saying your son
Stanford is a genius!

07:27.697 --> 07:29.495
All of his teachers
are going bananas

07:29.699 --> 07:31.246
over his science fair
experiment.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.328
You ever heard of
West Coast Tech?

07:33.536 --> 07:34.753
Best college
in the country.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.628
Their graduates turn
science fiction

07:36.831 --> 07:37.923
into science fact.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.922
The admissions team
is visiting tomorrow

07:40.126 --> 07:41.594
to check out
Stanford's experiment.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.298
Your son may be
a future millionaire, Mr. Pines.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.471
I'm impressed.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.019
What about our little
free spirit Stanley?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.721
That clown?
At this rate,

07:50.929 --> 07:52.647
he'll be lucky
to graduate high school.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.521
Look, there's a saltwater
taffy store on the dock,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.148
and somebody's gotta get paid
to scrape the barnacles off of it.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.607
Stanford's going places, but
hey, look on the bright side.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.409
At least you'll have one son
here in New Jersey forever.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.744
Jake's on them
if they think

08:06.945 --> 08:08.288
you wanna go to
some stuffy college

08:08.488 --> 08:09.910
on the other side
of the country.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.288
Once we get
the <i>Stan</i> O' War complete,

08:12.492 --> 08:13.709
it's gonna be
beaches, babes,

08:13.910 --> 08:15.833
and international
treasure hunting for us.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.957
Look, Stan, I can't pass up
a chance like this.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.758
This school has
cutting-edge programs

08:20.959 --> 08:22.961
and multi-dimensional
paradigm theory.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.797
Be-boop. I am a nerd robot.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.557
That's you.
That's what you sound like.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.805
[chuckles]
Ah, well,

08:30.010 --> 08:32.889
if the college board isn't impressed
with my experiment tomorrow,

08:33.096 --> 08:34.938
then okay, I'll do
the treasure hunting thing.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.437
And if they are?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.693
Well, then I guess
you better come visit me

08:38.893 --> 08:41.111
on the other side
of the country.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.826
<i>Without Ford, I was just
half of a dynamic duo.</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:49.246
<i>I couldn't make it
out there without him.</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:50.951
<i>And now, thanks to
that dumb college,</i>

08:51.156 --> 08:53.875
<i>I was gonna lose
my brother forever.</i>

08:56.453 --> 08:58.956
This is all your fault,
you dumb machine!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.710
Oh, no. No, no, no.
What did I do?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.009
There. All right.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.806
Good as new.
Probably.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.688
All right, kid,
show us what you got.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.687
Okay. Well,
what would you say

09:17.891 --> 09:19.768
if I told you
the future of technology

09:19.976 --> 09:21.694
was beneath this sheet?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.613
I'd say we wasted
a car trip.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.656
What?

09:25.857 --> 09:28.076
But it was stable yesterday.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.028
A fuse must've blown
or something.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.364
Kid, a perpetual motion
machine has one job--

09:32.572 --> 09:34.245
to not stop.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.793
I don't think you're
West Coast Tech material.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.620
No, wait. Don't go!

09:38.828 --> 09:40.546
I worked so hard.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.304
One paddle paddle paddle,
two paddle paddle.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.256
Man, that Jackie O.
What a fox.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.886
Hey, what's the word,
sixer?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.684
Can you explain
what this was doing

09:52.842 --> 09:54.640
next to my broken
project?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.396
Okay. I might've
accidentally been...

09:57.597 --> 09:59.190
horsing around.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.108
This was no accident, Stan.
You did this.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.027
You did this because
you couldn't handle me

10:03.228 --> 10:04.320
going to college
on my own.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.981
Look, it was a mistake.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.566
Although, if you
think about it,

10:07.774 --> 10:09.276
maybe there's
a silver lining.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.194
Huh? Treasure hunting?

10:12.028 --> 10:12.824
Are you kidding me?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.656
Why would I wanna do
anything with the person

10:14.864 --> 10:17.083
who sabotaged
my entire future?

10:18.076 --> 10:19.919
You did what,
you knucklehead?

10:20.120 --> 10:23.420
Stanley, what's
going on in here?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.466
Wait, no. I can explain.
It was a mistake.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.169
You ignoramus.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.675
Your brother was gonna be
our ticket outta this dump.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.722
All you ever do
is lie and cheat,

10:31.881 --> 10:33.975
and ride on
your brother's coattails.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.177
Well, this time,
you cost our family

10:36.386 --> 10:37.808
potential millions.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.810
And until you
make us a fortune,

10:40.014 --> 10:41.607
you're not welcome
in this household.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.778
What?! Stanford, tell him
he's being crazy.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.571
Stanford? Don't
leave me hanging.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.527
High six?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.032
Fine! I can make it
on my own.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.742
I don't need you,
I don't need anyone.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.702
I'll make millions,
and you'll rue the day

11:00.910 --> 11:02.753
you turned
your back on me.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.131
<i>Thanks to one dumb mistake,
I had no brother,</i>

11:05.331 --> 11:07.333
<i>no home, no nothing.</i>

11:07.542 --> 11:09.385
<i>But I had a plan
to fix everything.</i>

11:12.422 --> 11:14.971
Oh, this story's
so sad.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.894
I know what you two
little broken teacups need.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.892
To hug it out.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.848
Hug it out.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.775
Hug train
comin' in the station.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.695
Hugapalooza 2000!

11:27.896 --> 11:29.148
Kid, will you
knock that off?

11:29.355 --> 11:31.778
I'm trying to tell
my life story here.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.281
<i>I had decided I wasn't
gonna show my face at home</i>

11:34.485 --> 11:36.533
<i>till I proved I could
make something of myself.</i>

11:36.738 --> 11:38.581
<i>Unfortunately,
the treasure hunting business</i>

11:38.781 --> 11:40.328
<i>was slow going.</i>

11:40.533 --> 11:43.582
<i>Apparently, gold is
some kind of rare metal.</i>

11:43.786 --> 11:45.880
<i>Luckily, I struck
another kind of gold.</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:48.087
<i>In sales.</i>

11:48.291 --> 11:49.713
Hi there.
I'm Stan Pines

11:49.918 --> 11:51.170
<i>of Stance Enterprises.</i>

11:51.377 --> 11:54.722
Are you sick of this
always happening to you?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.179
Then you need
the chamois of the future.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.761
Made with the same material
astronauts use

11:59.969 --> 12:02.347
to clean up cranberry
stains on the moon.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.647
That's the Sham Total.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.397
It's a total sham.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.152
<i>I had made my mark,
all right.</i>

12:08.353 --> 12:09.775
<i>Unfortunately,
so did the chamois.</i>

12:09.979 --> 12:12.448
<i>Apparently, the cheap dye
I used to color them</i>

12:12.649 --> 12:14.322
<i>only made stains worse.</i>

12:14.525 --> 12:16.402
<i>Customers weren't
crazy about that.</i>

12:16.611 --> 12:17.828
<i>Luckily, they were
chasing me</i>

12:18.029 --> 12:19.872
<i>with Stanco-brand
pitchforks.</i>

12:21.115 --> 12:22.162
Suckers!

12:22.367 --> 12:24.415
<i>I was officially banned
from New Jersey.</i>

12:24.661 --> 12:26.208
<i>But with a quick name change,</i>

12:26.412 --> 12:28.460
<i>Steve Pinington was ready
to take on Pennsylvania.</i>

12:28.665 --> 12:30.338
Hi. I'm Steve Pinington.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.669
Are you sick of bandages
that are hard to remove?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.379
Then what you need is
the Rip Off.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.430
The Rip Off won't
give you rashes.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.679
I repeat, it won't
give you rashes.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.934
<i>It gave you rashes.</i>

12:43.888 --> 12:45.640
<i>I traveled
the whole country,</i>

12:45.848 --> 12:47.065
<i>sometimes
outside of it,</i>

12:47.267 --> 12:48.689
<i>always one step ahead
of the law,</i>

12:48.893 --> 12:51.692
<i>looking for something
that would be my big break.</i>

12:52.563 --> 12:55.817
Whoa. So that explains
all the fake ID's.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.276
But wait,
what about you?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.161
Did you end up going
to your dream school?

12:59.821 --> 13:00.913
Not exactly.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.741
All right, I know
Backupsmore

13:02.949 --> 13:04.667
wasn't anyone's
first choice,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.119
but what we lack in prestige

13:06.327 --> 13:09.126
we make up for in
mostly bug-free dorms.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.957
I'm sure your families
are proud.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.462
More or less.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.425
<i>In a place like that,
I had to work twice as hard.</i>

13:16.629 --> 13:18.131
<i>Luckily, that's what
I do best.</i>

13:18.339 --> 13:20.137
<i>I went from undergrad
to PhD</i>

13:20.341 --> 13:21.809
<i>three years ahead
of schedule,</i>

13:22.010 --> 13:23.432
<i>wrote a thesis that was
nationally ranked,</i>

13:23.636 --> 13:25.138
<i>and was awarded
an enormous grant</i>

13:25.346 --> 13:26.814
<i>for my own
scientific research.</i>

13:27.015 --> 13:28.688
<i>But what to study?</i>

13:28.891 --> 13:30.143
<i>My whole life,
I'd been teased</i>

13:30.351 --> 13:31.694
<i>for my six fingers.</i>

13:31.894 --> 13:34.488
<i>But that got me thinking
about anomalies.</i>

13:34.689 --> 13:37.033
<i>Things that were odd,
unusual</i>

13:37.233 --> 13:38.735
<i>statistically improbable.</i>

13:38.943 --> 13:40.536
<i>And according to
my investigations,</i>

13:40.737 --> 13:43.490
<i>there was one place with
a higher concentration</i>

13:43.698 --> 13:45.700
<i>of these things
than anywhere else.</i>

13:45.908 --> 13:48.912
<i>A small lumber town
in Roadkill County, Oregon.</i>

13:49.120 --> 13:50.963
<i>Gravity Falls.</i>

13:53.207 --> 13:55.551
<i>Meanwhile, your old
Uncle Stan was doing great.</i>

13:55.752 --> 13:57.299
<i>I'd come up with</i>

13:57.503 --> 13:59.426
a <i>sophisticated new
business strategy.</i>

13:59.630 --> 14:02.600
Come on. Owl, owl...

14:02.759 --> 14:04.557
Football player
with an omelet?!

14:04.719 --> 14:06.517
<i>Ga“!</i>

14:07.930 --> 14:10.103
<i>I was in great shape,
living on my own,</i>

14:10.308 --> 14:13.528
<i>and the best part was,
I didn't need help from nobody.</i>

14:15.480 --> 14:19.326
[line ringing]

14:19.525 --> 14:21.118
<i>Hello. This is
Stanford Pines.</i>

14:23.488 --> 14:26.742
<i>I was heading out
on my own, as well.</i>

14:26.949 --> 14:28.917
<i>I set to work
using my grant money</i>

14:29.118 --> 14:31.997
<i>to investigate the strange
properties of this town.</i>

14:32.163 --> 14:33.881
<i>But what would
I find here?</i>

14:37.168 --> 14:40.763
<i>Bingo. I began
to investigate at once.</i>

14:40.922 --> 14:43.892
<i>I knew I'd have to record
my findings.</i>

14:49.639 --> 14:51.687
<i>I began to keep
a journal.</i>

14:51.891 --> 14:54.485
[shrieking]

14:54.685 --> 14:56.028
The journals!

14:56.229 --> 14:58.027
Sorry, sorry.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.404
[clearing throat]
Got excited there

15:00.608 --> 15:02.326
about the journals.
Keep talking.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.829
I began to keep
a journal.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.372
[shrieking]

15:06.572 --> 15:08.074
I'm going
to ignore that.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.209
<i>There were anomalies
everywhere.</i>

15:10.410 --> 15:12.788
<i>And the more I looked,
the more I saw.</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:28.685
Fascinating.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.604
What did you say
your name was?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.982
Shmebulock... senior.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.651
<i>It was finally a place
where I felt at home,</i>

15:35.852 --> 15:38.071
<i>but something
nagged at me.</i>

15:38.271 --> 15:39.693
<i>Where did it all
come from?</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:41.023
<i>It seemed to me
the answer must lie</i>

15:41.232 --> 15:42.700
<i>outside of our world,</i>

15:42.900 --> 15:45.198
a <i>dimension of weirdness
leaking into ours.</i>

15:45.361 --> 15:47.659
<i>I realized the only way
to understand Gravity Falls</i>

15:47.864 --> 15:49.912
<i>would be to build
a gateway, a portal</i>

15:50.116 --> 15:51.993
<i>to the source of
its weirdness.</i>

15:52.160 --> 15:53.707
<i>But I couldn't
make it alone.</i>

15:53.911 --> 15:55.788
<i>I decided to call up
my old college buddy,</i>

15:55.997 --> 15:57.089
<i>Fiddleford McGucket,</i>

15:57.290 --> 15:59.042
a <i>young but brilliant
mechanic</i>

15:59.250 --> 16:00.752
<i>who was wasting his talent</i>

16:00.960 --> 16:02.303
<i>trying to make
personal computers</i>

16:02.503 --> 16:03.675
<i>in some garage in
Palo Alto.</i>

16:03.880 --> 16:05.553
[ringing]

16:05.756 --> 16:06.973
Hello. Fiddleford
Computermajigs.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.176
You say you're trying
to build

16:08.384 --> 16:10.227
a trans-universal
poly-dimensional meta vortex?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.222
Well, that's
mathematically feasible,

16:12.430 --> 16:14.273
I reckon.
[spits]

16:14.474 --> 16:17.944
<i>Many long nights were spent
perfecting the machine.</i>

16:18.144 --> 16:19.737
<i>It would be
the crowning achievement</i>

16:19.937 --> 16:21.939
<i>of my studies,
an answer to the source</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:23.821
<i>of this town's anomalies.</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:26.285
Get out, get out,
get out!

16:28.613 --> 16:30.581
<i>The time had come
to test it.</i>

16:33.826 --> 16:35.669
Ready?
And...

16:35.870 --> 16:37.087
- [yells]
- What?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.212
I got you, buddy.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.056
What is it?
Is it working?

16:51.385 --> 16:52.386
What did you see?

16:52.595 --> 16:55.644
[speaking gibberish]

16:55.848 --> 16:56.565
Fiddleford?

16:56.891 --> 16:59.144
When Gravity Falls
and earth becomes sky,

16:59.352 --> 17:00.774
fear the beast
with just one eye.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.397
Fiddleford, get
a hold of yourself.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.857
You're not making
any sense.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.362
This machine
is dangerous.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.318
You'll bring about
the end of the world with this.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.244
Destroy it before
it destroys us all!

17:09.403 --> 17:12.031
I can't destroy this.
It's my life's work.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.742
I fear we've unleashed
a great danger on the world.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.750
One I'd just
as soon forget. I quit.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.922
Fine. I'll do it
without you.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.215
I don't need you,
I don't need anyone.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.794
[eerie whispering]

17:25.336 --> 17:27.338
What? Who said that?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.466
<i>I was in
over my head,</i>

17:30.675 --> 17:32.018
<i>and feared I was
losing my sanity.</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:34.391
<i>I needed help.
Someone I could trust.</i>

17:36.764 --> 17:37.731
[pounding on door]

17:37.932 --> 17:39.730
Just give me a few more
clays, Rico.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.562
I'll pay your goons back,
I swear.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.130
You haven't seen your brother
in over ten years.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.802
It's okay. He's family.
He won't bite.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.181
Who is it? Have you come
to steal my eyes?

18:12.717 --> 18:13.934
Well, I can always
count on you

18:14.135 --> 18:15.478
for a warm welcome.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.152
Stanley, did anyone
follow you, anyone at all?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.605
Hello to you, too, pal.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.617
Hey, what is this?

18:29.817 --> 18:32.286
Sorry. I just had to
make sure you weren't...

18:32.486 --> 18:33.738
uh, it's nothing.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.664
Come in, come in.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.119
Are you gonna explain
what's going on here?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.128
You're acting like Mom
after her tenth cup of coffee.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.922
Listen, there
isn't much time.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.707
I've made huge mistakes,

18:44.915 --> 18:46.462
and I don't know
who I can trust anymore.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.841
Hey, easy there.
Let's talk this through, okay?

18:50.004 --> 18:52.302
I have something
to show you.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.224
Something you won't believe.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.722
I've been around
the world, okay?

18:55.885 --> 18:59.059
Whatever it is,
I'll understand.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.812
There is nothing
about this I understand.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.939
It's a trans-universal
gateway,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.487
a punched hole through
a weak spot in our dimension.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.736
I created it to unlock
the mysteries of the universe.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.533
But it could just as easily
be harnessed

19:11.734 --> 19:13.486
for terrible destruction.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.492
That's why I shut it down
and hid my journals

19:15.696 --> 19:17.198
which explain
how to operate it.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.033
There's only
one journal left.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.046
You are the only person
I can trust to take it.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.797
I have something
to ask of you.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.795
Remember our plans
to sail around the world

19:26.999 --> 19:28.717
on a boat?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.761
Take this book,
get on a boat,

19:30.920 --> 19:32.797
and sail as far away
as you can.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.382
To the edge
of the earth.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.218
Bury it where
no one can find it.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.354
That's it?

19:40.554 --> 19:42.807
You finally wanna see me
after ten years,

19:43.015 --> 19:45.518
and it's to tell me to get as
far away from you as possible?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.687
Stanley, you don't
understand what I'm up against.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.522
What I've been through.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.232
No, no, you don't understand
what I've been through.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.493
I've been to prison
in three different countries.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.287
I once had to chew my way
out of the trunk of a car.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.739
You think you've
got problems?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.949
I've got
a mullet, Stanford.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.125
Meanwhile,
where have you been?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.294
Living it up in
your fancy house in the woods,

20:04.495 --> 20:06.418
selfishly hoarding
your college money,

20:06.622 --> 20:08.169
because you only
care about yourself.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.297
I'm selfish?
I'm selfish?

20:10.501 --> 20:12.003
Stanley, how can
you say that

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
after costing me
my dream school?

20:14.422 --> 20:16.766
I'm giving you a chance to do
the first worthwhile thing in your life,

20:16.966 --> 20:18.388
and you won't
even listen.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.969
Well, listen to this.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.724
You want me to get rid
of this book?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.055
Fine, I'll get rid of it
right now.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.436
No! You don't understand.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.812
You said you wanted
me to have it,

20:26.016 --> 20:27.859
- so I'll do what I want with it.
- My research!

20:32.606 --> 20:34.108
Stanley, give it back.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.329
You want it back, you're gonna
have to try harder than that.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.416
You left me behind,
you jerk.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.334
It was supposed to be
us forever.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.084
- You ruined my life.
- You ruined your own life.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.009
Stanley. Oh, my gosh,
I'm so sorry.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.552
Are you all right?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.392
Some brother you
turned out to be.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.472
You care more about your dumb
mysteries than your family.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.602
Then you can have 'em.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.229
Whoa, whoa, hey.
What's going on?

21:08.434 --> 21:10.778
- Hey, Stanford...
- Stanley, help me.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.821
- What do I do?
- Stanley!

21:13.022 --> 21:15.275
Stanley,
do something!

21:15.441 --> 21:17.159
[screaming]

21:20.279 --> 21:21.496
Stanford?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.785
Stanford, come back.
I didn't mean it.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.789
I just got him back.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.419
I can't lose him again.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.004
Come on!

21:33.209 --> 21:35.678
[echoing]
Stanford!

21:35.878 --> 21:37.801
<i>I lost him.</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:39.840
<i>I didn't know
if he was dead or alive</i>

21:40.049 --> 21:41.676
<i>in some distant galaxy,</i>

21:41.842 --> 21:43.435
<i>but I knew his journal
must have the answer</i>

21:43.636 --> 21:45.809
<i>to getting him back...
somehow.</i>

21:51.852 --> 21:53.820
<i>I didn't get
much sleep that night.</i>

21:55.606 --> 21:57.859
<i>Or the night
after that.</i>

21:58.067 --> 22:01.662
<i>I tried for weeks to turn
that dumb machine back on.</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:03.159
<i>But without
the other two journals,</i>

22:03.322 --> 22:05.290
<i>it was hopeless.</i>

22:05.491 --> 22:07.118
<i>Finally,
I ran out of food.</i>

22:07.326 --> 22:09.829
<i>I had no choice
but to go into town.</i>

22:11.956 --> 22:14.050
Just the bread then,
stranger?

22:14.250 --> 22:16.002
That'll be 99 cents.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.555
Hey, that's no stranger.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.850
That must be
the mysterious science guy

22:23.050 --> 22:24.848
that lives in the woods.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.475
No, no, you got
the wrong guy.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.650
I've heard strange stories
about that old shack.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.400
Yeah, mysterious lights
and spooky experiments.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.485
Gosh, I'd pay anything

22:36.689 --> 22:39.363
to see what kind of shenanigans
you get up to in there.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.119
Me, too.
Do you ever give tours?

22:42.319 --> 22:44.788
No, really, I...

22:46.073 --> 22:47.290
[sighs]

22:47.491 --> 22:49.334
Yes, I do give tours.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.537
Ten... no, no,
15 bucks a person.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.668
[cheering excitedly]

22:55.541 --> 22:57.714
So what did you say
your name was,

22:57.918 --> 22:59.795
you man of mystery?

22:59.962 --> 23:01.680
Oh, Stan... ford.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.592
Stanford Pines.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.016
Step right up, folks,

23:08.220 --> 23:10.939
to a world of
enchantment or whatever.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.519
Behold the nerdy
science box.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.649
[electricity zaps]

23:15.853 --> 23:17.730
Ah! My eye!

23:17.938 --> 23:20.532
Uh, I can assure you,
that is in no way permanent.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.953
- I paid $15 for this?
- [people grumbling]

23:24.153 --> 23:27.828
Uh, you're lucky you weren't
part of the last tour group.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.785
They never made it
out alive.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.666
[chuckles nervously]
Right?

23:32.870 --> 23:35.669
[laughter]

23:35.873 --> 23:37.170
Funny.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.921
<i>So I came up
with a plan.</i>

23:39.126 --> 23:40.673
<i>I couldn't leave
my brother's house</i>

23:40.878 --> 23:42.471
<i>until I figured out
how to save him.</i>

23:42.671 --> 23:44.298
<i>But I needed to pay
his mortgage somehow.</i>

23:49.178 --> 23:50.725
<i>For once in my life,</i>

23:50.930 --> 23:52.807
<i>people were actually
buying what I was selling.</i>

23:53.015 --> 23:54.733
<i>And so,
the Murder Hut was born.</i>

23:54.934 --> 23:56.652
<i>Later renamed
the Mystery Shack.</i>

23:56.852 --> 23:59.446
<i>Finally, I'd found
something I was good at.</i>

23:59.647 --> 24:02.070
<i>For once, being
a liar and a cheat paid off.</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:04.447
<i>The old me was dead.</i>

24:04.652 --> 24:07.121
<i>And I faked a car crash
to prove it.</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:10.579
<i>By day, I was Stanford Pines,
Mr. Mystery.</i>

24:12.826 --> 24:14.544
<i>But by night, I was
down in the basement,</i>

24:14.745 --> 24:16.839
<i>trying to bring
the real Stanford back.</i>

24:18.582 --> 24:20.084
<i>I couldn't risk anyone
learning the truth</i>

24:20.292 --> 24:21.669
<i>and sabotaging my mission.</i>

24:21.877 --> 24:23.470
So I lied to everyone.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.218
The town, my family,
your parents.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.015
Even you kids.

24:27.216 --> 24:30.561
So all this time, you were just
trying to save your brother.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.814
Grunkle Stan, I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.106
That's okay, kid.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.526
I probably wouldn't
have believed me either.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.319
[man] I heard talking.
It was coming from downstairs.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.614
We're too late. The agents are
coming for us.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.157
What'll we do?

24:43.357 --> 24:45.701
Oh, man, I was so spellbound
by your dramatic tale,

24:45.901 --> 24:47.027
I forgot all about
those dudes.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.159
Wait. Forget.
That's it.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.292
I think I know a way we might
be able to defeat those agents.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.960
Of course.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.541
I don't know how you
got a hold of one of these,

24:56.745 --> 24:58.497
but this is perfect.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.926
I can just amplify the signal
to a radio headset frequency.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.175
There. Now everyone,
plug your ears!

25:06.380 --> 25:08.348
Get down now!

25:08.549 --> 25:10.096
Sir, looks like there's
a hidden door

25:10.300 --> 25:11.552
behind the vending machines.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.222
Excellent. Get me
Washington on line one.

25:14.430 --> 25:17.309
I've been practicing making sounds
of excitement for this very occasion.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.439
Hey, do you hear that?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.705
What? Where am I?

25:31.905 --> 25:35.785
Why am I standing in some sort
of goofy, fun knick-knack house?

25:35.993 --> 25:37.495
Stand down, gentlemen.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.956
I've been sent with the latest
intel from Washington.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.419
According to this
very real report,

25:41.623 --> 25:43.546
the power surges
in Gravity Falls

25:43.751 --> 25:45.219
were actually
due to radiation

25:45.419 --> 25:47.137
from an unreported
meteor shower.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.339
A total embarrassment
for your whole department.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.721
Luckily, I'm here to take
this mess off your hands.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.098
I'll need all of your
floppy disks,

25:54.303 --> 25:56.977
and, uh, eight tracks.
Right?

25:57.181 --> 26:01.778
Uh, everything about this case
is contained on this drive.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.230
Well, what are you
waiting for? A kiss on the cheek?

26:04.438 --> 26:06.486
Get outta here before
I have your butts court-martialed.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.489
Uh, yes, sir.
Apologies, sir.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.616
[whistles]
False alarm, everyone.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.822
Whoa.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.676
Great-uncle Stanford,
that was amazing.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.800
Let's not go crazy.
It was serviceable.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.464
Ha ha, thank you, kids.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.015
But please, call me Ford.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.765
Sure. Thanks,
great-uncle Ford.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.345
So, uh, would you mind
if I asked you

26:36.553 --> 26:38.021
a couple million questions
about Gravity Falls?

26:38.222 --> 26:40.190
Um, Well, I, uh...

26:40.390 --> 26:42.438
All right, kids,
it's been a long clay.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.190
Me and my brother have
a lot to talk about.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.613
- Why don't you hit the hay, huh?
- But it's the author.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.316
I've been waiting so long
to ask questions about--

26:48.482 --> 26:51.406
I said, hit the hay!

26:53.612 --> 26:56.365
I'll just let myself out.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.496
[phone dialing]

26:58.700 --> 27:00.498
Wendy, I've got something
amazing to tell you.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.420
Clear the next
14 hours.

27:03.831 --> 27:04.753
Look at us.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.755
When did we become
old men?

27:06.959 --> 27:08.586
You look like Dad.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.718
- Don't say that.
- [both laughing]

27:11.880 --> 27:14.099
[sighs]
Okay, Stanley, here's the deal.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.848
You can stay here for the summer
to watch the kids.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.679
I'll stay down in
the basement

27:18.887 --> 27:20.685
and try to contain
any remaining damage.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.266
When the summer's over,

27:22.474 --> 27:23.851
you give me
my house back,

27:24.059 --> 27:25.652
you give me
my name back,

27:25.853 --> 27:27.446
and this Mystery Shack
junk is over forever.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.273
You got it?

27:29.439 --> 27:30.861
You really aren't gonna
thank me, are you?

27:32.693 --> 27:34.695
Fine. On one condition.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.075
Stay away from the kids.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.748
I don't want them
in danger.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.791
'Cause as far as
I'm concerned,

27:39.992 --> 27:42.916
they're the only family
I have left.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.877
Did you hear
what they said?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.761
I think Uncle Ford said
they're gonna buy us

27:51.920 --> 27:53.718
puppies made of
ice cream.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.383
Might be wishful
thinking, though.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.093
I don't know if this
is good or bad.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.349
I wanted to meet
the author, but...

27:59.553 --> 28:02.557
Yeah. I liked the way
things were here before.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.566
Just us and Stan,

28:04.725 --> 28:06.602
and the occasional
goblin monster.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.063
I'm sure they'll
work things out.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.023
Dipper, you don't think
we'll turn out

28:11.231 --> 28:12.824
like Stan and Ford,
do you?

28:13.025 --> 28:14.743
What do you mean?

28:14.943 --> 28:17.787
I mean, they used to be
best friends,

28:17.988 --> 28:20.207
but then, they got
all stupid.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.626
Can you promise me
you won't get stupid?

28:22.826 --> 28:24.794
Not stupider than you,
dum-dum.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.623
[giggles]
Good night, stupid.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.583
Good night, stupid.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.473
<i>[Soos] Okay, so it turns out
the second Stan,</i>

28:36.673 --> 28:38.346
<i>the Stan
that we know,</i>

28:38.550 --> 28:39.972
<i>was actually Stanley,</i>

28:40.177 --> 28:42.555
<i>but the first Stan
was Stanford,</i>

28:42.721 --> 28:43.973
<i>but we didn't know</i>

28:44.181 --> 28:45.933
<i>until Stanford
came out of the portal,</i>

28:46.141 --> 28:47.643
<i>which was built
by Stanford,</i>

28:47.851 --> 28:49.979
<i>but then Stanley
pretending to be Stanford,</i>

28:50.187 --> 28:52.565
<i>he did the portal
'cause he's Stan,</i>

28:52.773 --> 28:53.774
<i>but he's not Stan.</i>

28:53.982 --> 28:55.655
Soos, it's 3:00
in the morning.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.452
<i>Okay, okay,
I understand.</i>

28:57.653 --> 28:59.747
<i>Anyway, act two,
Stan started...</i>

28:59.947 --> 29:01.164
Aaaah!
