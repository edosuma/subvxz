00:07.685 --> 00:10.445
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:44.685 --> 00:46.365
Okay, these are the last ones.

00:53.445 --> 00:54.485
Get off here.

01:19.005 --> 01:21.565
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the end of the line.

01:21.645 --> 01:23.485
-Get a move on! Out!
-Come on, let's go.

01:23.565 --> 01:25.925
Come on, let's go. Quickly, quickly.

01:26.005 --> 01:28.005
-Get a move on.
-Thank you for choosing our company.

01:28.085 --> 01:30.645
-Now you can fuck off.
-I'm getting pissed off at you. Hurry.

01:30.725 --> 01:32.045
Hurry up, lady, move it.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.845
-Move it. Move.
-Get off this thing. Move.

01:35.045 --> 01:36.045
Move! Come on!

01:36.125 --> 01:39.605
Hey, I told you go get off this thing.
Come on, move. Understand what I told you?

01:39.685 --> 01:41.485
-Yes.
-Come on, repeat it for me. Come on.

01:41.565 --> 01:42.925
It was the blacks, they did it.

01:43.005 --> 01:46.245
-Good. Or else?
-You'll find me. You know where I live.

01:46.325 --> 01:49.485
There you go, good. Now go home.
Go on. Go on, go home.

01:49.565 --> 01:50.605
Go. Go.

02:30.645 --> 02:32.925
Fucking baby seat.

02:39.045 --> 02:40.485
Are you sure nobody saw you?

02:40.565 --> 02:42.325
Who do you take us for, Cinaglia?

02:43.565 --> 02:45.605
-How'd it go?
-It went fine.

02:46.245 --> 02:48.045
With us, it always goes fine.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.685
Then you could have spared me
having to come out here.

02:51.245 --> 02:53.165
No, it's better you get used to it.

02:54.085 --> 02:56.165
Besides, it's a matter of trust.

02:56.245 --> 02:58.845
Now that you're here,
we know we can trust you.

02:59.565 --> 03:03.125
-You know what I'm risking, don't you?
-Yes, I know what you're risking.

03:03.205 --> 03:04.205
Exactly.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.405
It's time you got this white collar dirty.

03:08.245 --> 03:10.605
In fact, do something.
Tomorrow go for a walk in Ostia.

03:10.685 --> 03:12.765
That way you'll see
we're not playing around.

03:14.725 --> 03:15.725
Okay?

03:16.405 --> 03:18.165
Now get a move on, let's go.

03:34.045 --> 03:35.765
The matter has been resolved.

03:36.605 --> 03:40.965
This way, Badali will shut up for a while.
Now there's another task at hand.

03:42.005 --> 03:44.325
We have to find an ally on the Left.

03:47.365 --> 03:49.245
[in Sinti] [It's around 40 kilos.]

03:50.125 --> 03:52.285
[Angelica did a very good job.]

03:52.365 --> 03:56.845
Now we can make a nice proposal
to the families of Ostia.

03:58.285 --> 04:00.845
You'll see, they'll take it.

04:00.925 --> 04:03.565
Seeing as how they haven't got
a gram left to sell.

04:14.765 --> 04:15.965
What are you doing here?

04:16.765 --> 04:19.405
I've given up on that beer,
so I brought you some croissants.

04:19.485 --> 04:21.485
Thanks,
but I have to get back to the station.

04:22.045 --> 04:24.084
Come on, let's go up for a minute,
have some coffee.

04:24.645 --> 04:28.125
-After all, you worked all night, right?
-Cristiana, I have to see the boss.

04:28.925 --> 04:30.685
Are you sure he can't wait?

04:35.845 --> 04:38.125
All right, let's eat these croissants.

05:02.925 --> 05:06.685
-You're very strange, you know that.
-It took you long enough to figure it out.

05:09.645 --> 05:11.605
-Let's go now, it's late.
-Okay.

05:23.285 --> 05:25.845
-What happened to you?
-It was my cousins.

05:27.245 --> 05:28.765
They wanted to know where you were.

05:32.925 --> 05:34.445
I didn't tell them though.

05:45.325 --> 05:46.965
You stay here from now on.

05:47.565 --> 05:48.645
What's this?

05:49.365 --> 05:50.845
Are you going soft on me now?

05:55.605 --> 05:56.725
Let's go, come on.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.925
We don't know each other.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.125
Actually, we know each other very well.

06:15.205 --> 06:17.245
Even if we've never met in person.

06:17.325 --> 06:18.845
And that's enough.

06:18.925 --> 06:21.965
Listen to me. It'll be easier that way.

06:23.045 --> 06:24.605
What would be easier?

06:25.245 --> 06:26.605
Building something together.

06:26.685 --> 06:29.005
I'm a politician.
Remind me what it is that you do.

06:29.085 --> 06:30.605
Business.

06:30.685 --> 06:33.085
And in Rome you can't do business
without politicians.

06:33.165 --> 06:35.525
Have you run out of people
to do business with?

06:35.605 --> 06:37.845
No, the person I was counting on
has changed his stripes.

06:37.925 --> 06:38.845
I know.

06:38.925 --> 06:41.485
I need a new contact
in your political party.

06:41.565 --> 06:43.845
But as you know, I'm in parliament.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.885
-Not city hall.
-That's irrelevant.

06:45.965 --> 06:48.965
-When you have lots of friends.
-Yes, that's true.

06:49.045 --> 06:52.685
What's in it for me if I work with you?
Other than getting arrested, that is.

06:53.765 --> 06:56.085
I'm very generous with those who help me.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.565
A lot of people want to be helped.

06:58.645 --> 07:01.125
And they all have
much better stories than yours.

07:02.645 --> 07:04.605
Don't take too long to change your mind.

07:16.405 --> 07:18.205
Stand up! Stand up!

07:19.725 --> 07:20.885
Outside!

07:21.565 --> 07:22.805
Come on, stay on your feet.

07:24.085 --> 07:26.125
Magnani, what's going on?

07:26.205 --> 07:28.485
Looks like the refugees
beat up a bus driver

07:28.565 --> 07:30.845
during the transfer
to the new refugee camp.

07:30.925 --> 07:32.925
Then they escaped,
but we're out looking for them.

07:33.005 --> 07:35.365
Inspector, there are orders for you.

07:35.445 --> 07:37.405
Not now,
I have to sort out this situation.

07:37.485 --> 07:40.205
It's from the boss.
He says it's very important.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.605
-Your Eminence...
-Excuse me, they're waiting for me.

07:49.325 --> 07:51.685
Besides, I want nothing to do with you.

07:51.765 --> 07:54.125
And yet, there's something
I can do for you.

07:54.205 --> 07:58.365
For example, explain to you
that your alliance with Samurai is over.

07:59.165 --> 08:00.685
You're full of malice.

08:01.085 --> 08:02.845
Yes, that's true.

08:03.885 --> 08:07.645
And I want your help to wipe
that worm off the face of the earth.

08:09.005 --> 08:11.565
Your Eminence, you're not listening to me.

08:11.645 --> 08:13.525
But you really should.

08:30.525 --> 08:31.725
Almost done.

08:33.205 --> 08:35.845
-It stings.
-Of course it stings. Don't move.

08:38.965 --> 08:40.085
Wait.

08:43.405 --> 08:46.765
Hold this on it, and we're done. Here.

08:54.445 --> 08:58.045
Now all we need to do is remove
this tomboy mask that you've put on.

09:11.165 --> 09:14.725
In some families, being born a girl
is an unforgivable mistake.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.245
I put this mask on
to make my father happy.

09:23.805 --> 09:26.085
But he didn't even like me like this.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.685
You just need to be careful.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.725
There aren't many girls like you around.

09:40.005 --> 09:42.805
I knew one, who had real balls.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.205
But men don't like that.

09:55.925 --> 09:56.925
Wait.

10:08.245 --> 10:09.805
Your loss, anyway.

10:17.245 --> 10:18.485
Your friend's here. Go on.

10:23.085 --> 10:24.405
What the fuck has he done?

10:40.365 --> 10:41.525
Aureliano Adami?

10:42.525 --> 10:45.525
-Yes.
-You need to come with us to the station.

10:46.645 --> 10:47.965
Why? What happened?

10:48.965 --> 10:50.965
You're formally wanted for questioning.

10:52.045 --> 10:54.245
You'll have to answer a few questions.

10:56.765 --> 10:58.405
All right, I'll get my jacket.

11:14.285 --> 11:16.125
-Hey.
-Hey, come out from under there.

11:16.205 --> 11:17.645
-What?
-Come out.

11:21.725 --> 11:23.285
Do you need something, ma'am?

11:25.045 --> 11:28.405
I heard that you're having a few problems.

11:28.485 --> 11:29.845
And who are you?

11:29.925 --> 11:31.405
Adelaide Anacleti.

11:33.165 --> 11:36.245
Well, you heard wrong.
We're all good here. Sweet as sugar.

11:36.325 --> 11:39.205
Your uncle doesn't seem too good,
and neither do you.

11:40.405 --> 11:43.765
You should know gypsies aren't welcome
in Ostia, no fucking way.

11:50.725 --> 11:52.685
I have a proposal for you.

11:52.765 --> 11:55.045
For you and all the Ostia families.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.125
We'll give you the cocaine.

11:58.005 --> 11:59.405
You sell it

12:00.165 --> 12:02.045
and get a certain amount every week.

12:02.565 --> 12:04.165
What are we, your slaves?

12:04.245 --> 12:07.085
Maybe you don't understand,
we're not going on anyone's payroll.

12:07.165 --> 12:08.965
Instead, let's talk about percentages.

12:09.045 --> 12:10.645
-That'll make us happy.
-Yeah.

12:11.365 --> 12:13.005
How about ten percent?

12:14.125 --> 12:17.325
I don't even talk for ten percent,
let alone smile.

12:17.405 --> 12:19.125
Come on, you can do better than that.

12:20.445 --> 12:21.645
You tell me.

12:24.885 --> 12:25.685
Forty.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.125
Twenty.

12:29.845 --> 12:32.445
Or you can always go back to Aureliano.

12:32.525 --> 12:34.965
Only he doesn't have a gram of coke.

12:36.885 --> 12:39.405
-All right, but how much have you got?
-A lot.

12:41.165 --> 12:42.885
What does the genius over there say?

12:46.325 --> 12:48.525
Now we're getting somewhere.

12:48.605 --> 12:50.005
Get the families together.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.645
Call me when you're ready.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.605
Goodbye.

13:15.165 --> 13:16.325
Bastards!

13:17.285 --> 13:18.285
No more!

13:22.165 --> 13:24.445
-What's going on?
-They've caught the refugees.

13:24.525 --> 13:25.965
Those shits escaped.

13:26.045 --> 13:27.285
They're out of control.

13:27.365 --> 13:29.565
They beat the driver to a pulp.

13:29.645 --> 13:31.525
Get them out of here!

13:37.845 --> 13:39.325
You're disgusting!

13:42.645 --> 13:44.925
Hey. Did you see what they did?

13:45.005 --> 13:48.045
-Are you done talking shit?
-What are you talking about?

13:48.125 --> 13:51.565
That you're on Samurai's payroll.
You've worked with him for three months.

13:51.645 --> 13:54.045
-Look, you're wrong.
-I'm wrong, am I?

13:54.125 --> 13:57.085
You're another of those turds
who's reduced Rome to the shithole it is.

14:01.445 --> 14:02.645
Hey!

14:02.725 --> 14:04.165
Hey, are you listening to me?

14:06.965 --> 14:09.045
Turn on the radio this evening.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.125
So you can hear
what I've got to say about you.

14:11.205 --> 14:12.965
Remember, all of Rome listens to me.

14:42.285 --> 14:45.365
Good morning, Inspector Marchilli.
Did you pick up Adami?

14:47.245 --> 14:48.645
Yes.

14:48.725 --> 14:50.285
Bring him in.

15:01.045 --> 15:04.125
You can go, thank you.
I want to speak to him alone.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.205
Where were you yesterday?

15:14.965 --> 15:16.365
I was at home all day.

15:16.445 --> 15:18.685
I imagine you have a witness?

15:18.765 --> 15:20.205
Yes. My girlfriend.

15:21.365 --> 15:22.765
Do you know Gabriele Marchilli?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.365
Doesn't ring a bell.

15:28.725 --> 15:30.285
Careful of what you say.

15:31.045 --> 15:33.565
You're here as a person
we believe has information.

15:33.645 --> 15:36.405
-But you could easily become a suspect.
-Suspected of what?

15:37.325 --> 15:38.525
Well?

15:43.405 --> 15:44.845
Does this ring a bell?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.725
That's the guy who brought me in.

15:50.165 --> 15:51.405
I met him at the gym.

15:51.485 --> 15:54.605
-I didn't even know he was a cop.
-Gabriele Marchilli.

15:56.325 --> 15:59.285
-Now do you remember seeing him yesterday?
-No.

15:59.365 --> 16:01.285
I see a lot of people.

16:02.085 --> 16:03.925
I don't understand
where you're going with this.

16:07.005 --> 16:08.245
Samurai.

16:10.165 --> 16:12.885
-Do you know him?
-Who doesn't know him?

16:12.965 --> 16:15.765
-What's your relationship with him?
-I'd like to shoot him.

16:18.485 --> 16:21.645
Why is Mara Guagli interrogating
Aureliano Adami? Well?

16:21.725 --> 16:23.645
-Who let her in here?
-She's with the Mobile Unit.

16:23.725 --> 16:25.685
She spoke to the boss
and he gave her a room.

16:25.765 --> 16:27.965
I'm investigating Aureliano Adami.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.525
Is that clear?

16:31.325 --> 16:32.685
We're done for today.

16:33.925 --> 16:35.925
However, I'd advise you
to get a good lawyer.

16:36.005 --> 16:37.005
I have one.

16:38.085 --> 16:39.365
Thanks.

17:24.205 --> 17:25.604
You can't see anything.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.245
-Does this thing work?
-Yes, yes. It works.

17:31.324 --> 17:32.525
Come here and look.

17:32.604 --> 17:35.245
This is the gestational sac.

17:35.325 --> 17:37.845
Wait... Now listen to this.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.925
-Oh God, what is it, his heart?
-Yes.

17:53.925 --> 17:56.245
-Hear how it's beating?
-Yes.

17:58.205 --> 18:01.525
-Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
-It's still too early for that.

18:01.605 --> 18:04.405
It's all the same to her,
but I'd like a boy. You know how it is.

18:04.485 --> 18:06.485
-What are you saying!
-What? It's true.

18:06.565 --> 18:09.005
-You said you don't care.
-Whatever.

18:37.085 --> 18:39.925
No, there's no need to get out.
This will be quick.

18:40.405 --> 18:43.645
That nomination
to be head of the congregation of bishops.

18:43.725 --> 18:45.805
For the time being
it's better if you forget about it.

18:48.845 --> 18:50.645
What are you talking about?

18:51.445 --> 18:54.685
I've been called to a meeting tomorrow,
to be assigned the post.

18:54.765 --> 18:57.565
-The ceremony has already been prepared.
-Ah!

18:57.645 --> 19:01.005
Call them up and tell them you don't feel
up to it, that you're pulling out.

19:01.605 --> 19:03.445
Health reasons... Say whatever you like.

19:03.525 --> 19:05.365
You don't seem to understand.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.045
It's a papal nomination.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.685
And I don't think
even you can interfere with that.

19:13.725 --> 19:16.765
With what I know about you,
I count more than the Pope.

19:17.645 --> 19:21.485
Whereas you are starting
to matter less and less, Cardinal.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.765
You're kidding, right?

19:24.845 --> 19:26.365
Do I look like I'm kidding?

19:45.925 --> 19:47.925
Jesus, some performance, well done.

19:48.445 --> 19:49.845
I couldn't do anything.

19:49.925 --> 19:52.485
-What did she ask you?
-If I knew you.

19:53.645 --> 19:57.045
-That pain in the ass, who is she?
-She worked with my father.

19:58.805 --> 20:01.005
I thought it had something to do
with this morning.

20:02.365 --> 20:05.685
Instead, she had a photograph
of me and you when we met at the hospital.

20:05.765 --> 20:07.285
And she wanted to know about you.

20:08.765 --> 20:11.805
You don't think they're after us
for old shit, the priest and all that?

20:11.885 --> 20:13.405
No. I don't think so.

20:15.285 --> 20:18.085
-Is that all she asked you?
-What else should she have asked me?

20:18.165 --> 20:19.165
Nothing.

20:20.525 --> 20:21.565
Nothing.

20:23.365 --> 20:25.325
She's breathing down our necks,
it's not good.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.325
I don't need to tell you that, do I?

20:39.285 --> 20:40.285
What happened?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.525
I saw Gabriele taking Adami
into the police station.

20:43.085 --> 20:46.525
They were bringing in all the refugees
and I was there when it happened.

20:46.965 --> 20:50.245
-None of those three will talk, will they?
-No, they won't talk.

20:50.325 --> 20:52.325
They'd rather die than talk.

20:53.005 --> 20:55.085
Anyway, the guys did
what they were supposed to.

20:56.045 --> 20:57.805
-Yes.
-Pardon me.

21:00.205 --> 21:01.885
Yes, Your Eminence...

21:04.805 --> 21:05.965
Of course.

21:06.445 --> 21:08.845
Ten o'clock tonight at your place.
All right.

21:09.845 --> 21:12.925
What made you change your mind so fast,
Cardinal Giunti?

21:15.365 --> 21:17.205
All right, you can explain it to me later.

21:21.605 --> 21:23.725
In any case, Amedeo, listen to me.

21:23.805 --> 21:25.885
There's no point in worrying about it.

21:26.805 --> 21:28.365
I have to go now.

21:29.925 --> 21:31.005
-Bye.
-Bye.

21:40.285 --> 21:41.285
Hey!

21:42.125 --> 21:44.285
Let's not say anything for now, okay?

21:44.365 --> 21:46.205
Are you kidding? Of course not.

21:53.165 --> 21:55.085
Listen up, everyone!

22:01.605 --> 22:03.605
-Spadino has an heir!
-No!

23:12.085 --> 23:15.125
[in Sinti] [Now make sure you pick
the right one.]

23:15.205 --> 23:18.685
[You're the mother,
you're sure to make the right choice.]

23:19.245 --> 23:22.485
[Come on, let's see what it is!
A boy or a girl?]

23:22.565 --> 23:25.485
[Boy! Boy! Boy...]

23:26.045 --> 23:29.405
[Girl! Girl! Girl...]

24:02.805 --> 24:04.485
What happened at the police station?

24:16.165 --> 24:17.365
Close the door.

24:27.325 --> 24:28.605
Why did they take you in?

24:28.685 --> 24:30.845
-What did you tell them?
-Fuck all.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.285
It had nothing to do
with what went down this morning.

24:37.045 --> 24:38.445
Where the fuck are you going?

24:44.685 --> 24:46.845
You came all this way
to ask me that question?

24:48.085 --> 24:49.325
What would you have told them?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.085
-What does that matter?
-It matters.

24:51.165 --> 24:53.765
Say they nab you
and put the squeeze on you.

24:55.925 --> 24:58.805
How long before you talk? Well, Cinaglia?

24:59.965 --> 25:01.725
Because you're not a politician anymore.

25:03.245 --> 25:04.645
You're a criminal.

25:06.365 --> 25:07.805
You're a thug.

25:10.525 --> 25:14.285
And so, you've got to start thinking
like a criminal.

25:19.325 --> 25:21.285
You shouldn't even be asking me
these questions.

25:23.645 --> 25:25.085
Or else I'll start to worry.

25:28.245 --> 25:30.125
-I don't need to worry, do I?
-No.

25:32.605 --> 25:33.845
We're all good.

25:45.125 --> 25:47.885
-Can I talk to you?
-Yeah, sure.

25:54.445 --> 25:56.485
Listen, that colleague
from the Mobile Unit

25:57.045 --> 25:59.525
thinks something's going on
between you and Aureliano Adami.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.485
She's investigating you.

26:03.965 --> 26:05.085
I wanted to tell you.

26:05.765 --> 26:06.765
Yes.

26:07.765 --> 26:08.965
I know.

26:15.245 --> 26:16.645
Why's she got it in for you?

26:27.685 --> 26:29.445
My father had a thing with her.

26:30.685 --> 26:32.605
But he never wanted to bring her home.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.685
Mara always thought it was my fault.

26:43.125 --> 26:44.565
Then Dad died.

26:47.725 --> 26:49.245
And she went crazy.

26:51.325 --> 26:52.485
That's absurd.

26:54.845 --> 26:56.525
But what's Adami got to do with this?

26:57.245 --> 26:58.845
She must have seen me with him.

26:59.445 --> 27:01.325
I've been tailing him for weeks.

27:03.525 --> 27:06.325
Cristiana,
there's a turf war going on in Ostia

27:06.405 --> 27:09.845
and I'm trying to convince Adami
to sell out the rival families.

27:12.525 --> 27:14.885
I had no idea it was anything like that.

27:18.925 --> 27:20.125
I'll tell you the truth.

27:22.845 --> 27:24.245
She came to me.

27:25.045 --> 27:28.165
-She practically asked me to spy on you.
-Really?

27:39.365 --> 27:41.805
Would you be willing to put that
in a statement?

28:02.285 --> 28:04.485
I'm happy to see you. What's going on?

28:05.605 --> 28:07.325
I only came for a minute.

28:08.925 --> 28:10.125
Bad news, Aureliano.

28:11.965 --> 28:14.525
The Anacletis made a deal
with the Gravonis and the other families

28:14.605 --> 28:15.765
to do business in Ostia.

28:28.205 --> 28:31.245
Do me a favor.
Get the families together, since I can't.

28:33.165 --> 28:34.325
And bring her.

28:37.285 --> 28:38.285
Thanks.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.165
Wait.

28:56.205 --> 28:58.525
It's not much, but at least you can start
working again.

29:02.885 --> 29:04.165
Be careful.

29:08.725 --> 29:10.365
The wipes are
to the right of the register.

29:10.445 --> 29:12.445
-Thank you.
-Thank you, goodbye.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.845
Good evening, can I help you?

29:29.005 --> 29:31.485
Yes, I'm looking for a cradle. For a boy.

29:31.565 --> 29:33.725
Certainly. Please, this way.

29:34.965 --> 29:36.845
This here is a very beautiful cradle.

29:36.925 --> 29:38.845
-It's traditional--
-No, I don't like it.

29:40.005 --> 29:43.205
We have this other one,
a traditional "Granny style" cradle.

29:43.285 --> 29:46.525
-It has a little cushion--
-Listen, haven't you got anything more...

29:47.525 --> 29:49.445
A bit more impressive?
Not this crap.

29:49.525 --> 29:50.565
It's for my son.

29:50.645 --> 29:52.685
Sure. This one also comes in blue,
if you prefer.

29:52.765 --> 29:53.965
Wait a second.

29:56.645 --> 29:57.885
Aureliano?

30:00.245 --> 30:02.125
No, I can't come now, I'm busy.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.205
What did my mother do?

30:06.885 --> 30:09.085
-I'm on my way.
-We've sold a lot of this model--

30:09.165 --> 30:11.765
Listen, wait for me to come back
before you close. Understand?

30:11.845 --> 30:14.325
Here we're choosing a cradle
for an Anacleti.

30:14.405 --> 30:15.765
Does that name ring a bell?

30:33.925 --> 30:35.605
So, why did you call me?

30:39.525 --> 30:41.205
This morning in Ostia.

30:41.685 --> 30:43.605
I organized that chaos.

30:45.645 --> 30:48.005
Have you seen the latest polls?

30:48.485 --> 30:50.285
Yes, we're gaining.

30:50.365 --> 30:51.765
Wait, let me understand.

30:52.885 --> 30:56.845
The driver, the refugees escaping,
all that chaos... That was your doing?

31:00.245 --> 31:01.925
"Rome is not the Far West."

31:04.605 --> 31:05.925
You said that, right?

31:07.725 --> 31:08.765
A great fucking idea.

31:10.165 --> 31:11.565
It's a simple idea.

31:12.685 --> 31:15.165
That's how people are: simple.

31:20.605 --> 31:22.765
Barzacci, you've got to trust me.

31:26.725 --> 31:29.445
All right. You'll get what you asked for.

31:30.525 --> 31:31.685
But it stays between us.

31:31.765 --> 31:35.405
The party, the candidate for mayor,
they mustn't know anything.

31:36.725 --> 31:37.565
Sure.

31:47.845 --> 31:50.885
I found out that you're spying on me
outside of an official investigation.

31:56.605 --> 31:59.725
Well, starting tomorrow
you can stop busting my balls.

32:05.805 --> 32:08.365
Actually, I'm hoping
to send you to jail very soon.

32:10.325 --> 32:11.325
No, I don't think so.

32:13.205 --> 32:15.125
You're abusing your power,

32:15.205 --> 32:17.045
investigating a colleague for no reason.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.805
Fuck you!

32:20.765 --> 32:24.125
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
the station is assessing what you did.

32:24.205 --> 32:26.485
-And they'll be taking action.
-What a lot of bullshit!

32:27.285 --> 32:28.645
There's a witness.

32:36.045 --> 32:37.085
Cristiana, right?

32:41.165 --> 32:42.845
Your father was right.

32:44.845 --> 32:46.405
You're nothing but a criminal.

32:51.405 --> 32:53.685
And you're nothing but a poor crazy woman.

32:56.605 --> 32:58.725
How the fuck could he have been with you?

33:03.645 --> 33:04.845
Go get some sleep, go on.

33:06.365 --> 33:08.525
Because you're going to have
a shitty day tomorrow.

33:16.245 --> 33:19.045
We've got to be on our guard
with these gypsies, I tell you.

33:19.845 --> 33:20.965
They're all thieves.

33:21.045 --> 33:22.565
And what are we?

33:23.405 --> 33:26.085
-You pricked them with the fork, right?
-Of course.

33:31.605 --> 33:32.725
May I come in?

33:34.005 --> 33:35.085
Who's there?

33:35.805 --> 33:38.045
I want to take you with me somewhere.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.125
Where?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.805
I've set up a meeting
with all the family heads.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.725
It's only right
that you should be there too, no?

33:46.805 --> 33:49.165
-I don't give a shit--
-You don't give a shit?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.325
Are you coming?

34:02.285 --> 34:03.405
Piece of shit!

34:05.725 --> 34:06.765
Come here.

34:07.205 --> 34:08.205
Come here.

34:23.565 --> 34:25.765
So you like beating up girls, do you?

34:41.605 --> 34:42.485
Good for you.

35:10.605 --> 35:12.365
On air in two minutes.

35:13.205 --> 35:14.485
I don't have time for you.

35:16.165 --> 35:17.925
In two minutes I'm going to destroy you.

35:22.325 --> 35:23.325
Adriano.

35:24.845 --> 35:25.885
Wait.

35:26.965 --> 35:29.205
Did you see what happened
this morning at the station?

35:29.805 --> 35:31.365
People were really pissed off.

35:32.045 --> 35:34.485
That's a fact, not just talk.

35:34.565 --> 35:36.605
What the fuck has that got to do with you?

35:36.685 --> 35:38.885
On air in 90 seconds.

35:38.965 --> 35:40.325
It was my doing.

35:40.885 --> 35:42.885
What happened this morning.

35:43.885 --> 35:45.045
What are you saying?

35:46.205 --> 35:48.525
Let's just say,
I knew it was going to happen.

35:50.725 --> 35:53.085
And now the Right is on my side.

35:55.045 --> 35:57.165
And you, Adriano, which side are you on?

35:59.365 --> 36:00.565
Who's helping you?

36:01.525 --> 36:03.405
On air in 60 seconds.

36:15.605 --> 36:17.685
On air in 45 seconds.

36:17.765 --> 36:19.805
Aureliano Adami and Alberto Anacleti.

36:21.245 --> 36:24.005
And there's even a cop:
Gabriele Marchilli.

37:42.645 --> 37:43.885
Do you recognize them?

37:45.245 --> 37:46.045
No?

37:47.205 --> 37:48.245
Do you recognize them?

37:54.165 --> 37:55.485
They're friends of yours.

38:01.525 --> 38:03.805
I didn't know
how else to make you understand...

38:07.405 --> 38:09.205
As long as I'm alive, I'm in charge.

38:10.645 --> 38:12.885
And we're not doing business
with the gypsies.

38:14.485 --> 38:16.245
Has anyone got anything to say?

38:23.205 --> 38:25.965
I'm getting a shipment soon,
and you can start dealing again.

38:27.685 --> 38:29.725
Was there any need for all this mess?

38:34.405 --> 38:35.725
I'll leave these guys with you.

38:39.605 --> 38:40.845
As a reminder.

38:57.845 --> 39:01.445
I've worked my whole life for it.
That nomination is mine by right.

39:01.925 --> 39:05.205
And as long as I'm here,
you'll stay in your place.

39:06.365 --> 39:07.445
Is that clear?

39:54.325 --> 39:55.565
Where are you going?

39:56.765 --> 39:58.005
To sleep.

39:59.565 --> 40:00.925
No, you're coming with me.

40:01.565 --> 40:02.885
Where to?

40:02.965 --> 40:05.325
Trust me.
Besides, you owe me a favor.

40:08.685 --> 40:09.685
Hey!

40:10.885 --> 40:11.965
Let's go.

41:03.005 --> 41:05.405
You should have
forgotten about the nomination.

41:06.285 --> 41:08.245
You knew I wouldn't do that.

41:11.525 --> 41:14.125
What was it that made you think
it was your decision?

41:19.285 --> 41:21.005
I'm not a puppet.

41:21.485 --> 41:23.205
And we had a deal.

41:27.045 --> 41:29.045
Don't think I enjoy this

41:29.805 --> 41:32.125
after having invested so much in you.

42:12.485 --> 42:14.805
There, perfect. This one is Swedish.

42:14.885 --> 42:17.325
Bent birch. Light.

42:17.405 --> 42:18.565
Indestructible.

42:32.405 --> 42:34.965
-What happened?
-The Cardinal.

42:35.045 --> 42:36.845
It seems he fell down the stairs.

43:15.485 --> 43:17.925
