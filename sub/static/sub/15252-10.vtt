Hi. I'm chuck.

00:01.780 --> 00:03.310
Here's a few things that y
ou might need to know.

00:03.530 --> 00:04.370
It#s hard to say good-bye.

00:04.370 --> 00:06.480
Chuck: brqce larkin from 
connecticut is a spy?

00:06.480 --> 00:08.960
A rogue spy said he try to contact you?

00:08.960 --> 00:10.700
He...He sent...
He sent me af e-mail.

00:11.530 --> 00:14.560
Bryce sent me a whole database of government 
secrets that are now locked in my brain.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.470
Keeping me in a constant state of fear, 
danger and anxiety.

00:19.110 --> 00:20.150
You and bryce, that's not true.

00:20.610 --> 00:21.130
Right?

00:21.860 --> 00:23.020
It was complicated.

00:23.570 --> 00:24.520
It was nice knowing you.

00:28.700 --> 00:29.510
It's tommy.

00:29.910 --> 00:30.810
We have a problem.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.590
The package has been intercepted.

00:32.590 --> 00:33.820
We're going to have to clean things up.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.920
Oh, my god.
Bryce.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.040
It sounded like...

01:14.400 --> 01:14.920

01:19.910 --> 01:20.730

01:22.930 --> 01:23.470

01:49.620 --> 01:50.490
It's complicated, buddy.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.950
It's...It's just...
It's complicated & yeah?

01:52.950 --> 01:53.810
No.Listen, man.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.180
You like her, she likes you.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.190
Yeah.Wow!
I'm confused.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.520
I thought it wasn't going 
anywhere-- that it was over.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.220
And then...And then we had this...

02:02.380 --> 02:03.270
This moment.

02:04.810 --> 02:05.910
This really...

02:06.350 --> 02:07.000
I mean...

02:08.210 --> 02:10.690
Great moment.

02:12.590 --> 02:17.850
Then, in the moment right after that, 
i realized what a huge mispake it was to break up with her.

02:30.070 --> 02:31.530
I'm...I'm actually going to leave now.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.830
No.Hey, quick question.

02:33.830 --> 02:35.430
It's cool if anna comes to 
thanksgiving dinner, right?

02:35.430 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.Of course.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.100
I mean, you know how ellie loves 
big thanksgiving dinners.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.730
- See?
- Is ellie going to be there?

02:40.620 --> 02:43.440
Well, yes, because chuck lives 
at ellie's apartment.

02:43.790 --> 02:44.560
I know that.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.040
And she kind of makes all 
my favorite dishes.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.170
You know, like, stuffing with apple chips, 
and sweet potatoes with marshmallows.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.160
And i know that, too.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.090
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?

02:54.460 --> 02:55.230
Not yet.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.230
She...
Scares the crap out of me.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.330
What is that about?

03:02.330 --> 03:04.650
She's got this crazy idea that 
i'm in love with ellie.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.510
'Cause you are.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.710
Why does everybody know that?

03:06.710 --> 03:09.170
Because that's what you tell everybody.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.410
I don't know what to do, man.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.280
I'm...I'm...
I'm in love with two women.

03:12.280 --> 03:12.960
Bartowski!

03:12.960 --> 03:14.070
Grimes!

03:14.660 --> 03:16.130
Does no tang mean no work?

03:16.970 --> 03:18.480
Bartowski, round up your team.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.100
Grimes$ stay close.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.090
Some of you are new, so listen up!

03:23.160 --> 03:24.310
Tomorrow is thanksgiving.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.950
Do any of you know what 
happens after thanksgiving?

03:26.950 --> 03:28.290
The tryptophan wears off,?

03:28.290 --> 03:30.340
And it's time for the liquor to kick in?

03:30.340 --> 03:35.450
No, i'm talking about black friday, 
people-- the biggest shopping day of the year, 

03:35.450 --> 03:41.230
when regular housawives transform into 
a crazy mob blinded by door prizes, sales, 

03:41.230 --> 03:44.170
and the urge to get the christmas 
shopping done early.

03:44.170 --> 03:47.290
On friday, i'm reassigning you 
nerds to crowd control.

03:47.290 --> 03:48.920
Be here tomorrkw for training.

03:48.920 --> 03:53.760
Tomorrow is thanksgiving, so wouldn't we, 
as a store, be closed?

03:54.210 --> 03:55.660
You got a key.
Work it out.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.470
Grimes, you know the drill.

03:58.470 --> 04:01.880
- Get these geeks trained and ready for action.
- Yes, sir.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.050
Hey, relax, chuck.

04:08.610 --> 04:09.590
Things are, uh...

04:09.790 --> 04:10.770
Things are looking up for you.

04:10.770 --> 04:11.670
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

04:11.670 --> 04:12.590
And how would that be?

04:15.310 --> 04:16.870
Turn on your heart light, buddy.

04:17.100 --> 04:17.910
Let it glow.

04:24.350 --> 04:24.970
I don't...

04:25.090 --> 04:29.770
I don't want to play beckman here, 
but if you don't start answering my calls, 

04:29.770 --> 04:34.060
then super secret spy resource 
chuck bartowski does kind of go to waste.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.340
- Did you flash on something;
- No.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.170
No, i was...
I was calling about other stuff.

04:39.170 --> 04:40.420
You didn't happen to listen to my messages?

04:40.420 --> 04:41.410
Chuck, we have to talk.

04:41.410 --> 04:41.930
No.Wait.

04:41.930 --> 04:43.580
- Can i say something first?
- No.Chuck...

04:43.580 --> 04:44.360
It's the kiss, right?

04:45.640 --> 04:46.990
It is.
It's got to be the kiss.

04:46.990 --> 04:50.640
First of all, i know that the moment 
was very life-or-deathish.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.200
And, normally, i would run from 
a situation like that.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.310
You, on the other hand...

04:54.150 --> 04:56.470
You, um...

04:56.830 --> 04:59.470
You...You kissed me, which was just...

05:00.890 --> 05:03.240
But the thing...

05:03.240 --> 05:05.380
The thing is that i'd like to talk about, 
is i'd like to invite you to thanksgiving dinner, 

05:05.380 --> 05:10.250
but we need a cover for that, so really, 
what i'm trying to ask you is, uh...

05:11.010 --> 05:13.650
Are we back together?

05:14.270 --> 05:16.410
Chuck, bryce is alive.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.990
Sarah, you told me bryce was dead.

05:23.850 --> 05:25.070
I read his obituary.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.360
We gent to his funeral.

05:28.690 --> 05:29.800
How is this possibhe?

05:30.620 --> 05:32.550
We don't know, chuck.
He won't talk to our people.

05:34.190 --> 05:34.950
Not even you?

05:35.390 --> 05:36.900
Casey: he hasn't seen either of us.

05:37.370 --> 05:37.870
Why?

05:38.300 --> 05:39.570
Because he asked for you.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.580
We want to know what 
happened to him.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.080
We think he'll talk to you.

05:43.930 --> 05:44.720
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.010
Hold on a second.

05:47.710 --> 05:48.250
Well...

05:48.250 --> 05:51.870
You want me to go in there and 
ask him what exactly?

05:51.870 --> 05:53.070
Just so we're on the same page.

05:53.470 --> 05:55.520
"hey, bryce, "why did you send 
me the intersect?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.460
Why did you choose my life to ruin?

05:57.460 --> 05:59.550
" how exactly do i start that conversation?

05:59.550 --> 06:01.080
Just talk to him, okay?

06:01.080 --> 06:02.440
Be a friend, you're good at that.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.660
Remember, he's rogue cia, 
trained assassin...

06:08.550 --> 06:09.230
So be careful.

06:11.020 --> 06:11.670
Thanks.

06:27.710 --> 06:28.320
Who are you?

06:29.200 --> 06:29.780
Hey.

06:30.970 --> 06:32.490
Hey, bryce, buddy.

06:33.180 --> 06:35.120
It's me...
Chuck.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.120
I don't believe you.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.950
What did you do with the real chuck?

06:48.550 --> 06:49.910
I'd like to come out now please.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.360
Natural born interrogator, huh?

06:55.030 --> 06:55.770
Fantastic.

06:58.860 --> 06:59.880
All right, well...

07:01.090 --> 07:06.040
Unless we're in the twilight zone right 
now, and thebe really is another chuck and i'm his clone, 

07:06.040 --> 07:08.580
the answer to your question 
is-- yes, i am chuck.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.050
Prove it.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.600
Tlingan khol da-jatl-a?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.100
Oh, come on, they're watching us right now.

07:17.780 --> 07:18.370
Do it.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.020
Khi-ja.

07:24.090 --> 07:25.860
Bi-piv-kha-low.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.320
What the hell?

07:29.030 --> 07:30.730
Your klingon's a bit rusty, chuck.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.060
Yeah, i've been kind of busy lately...

07:33.550 --> 07:34.940
Ever since i got your e-mail.

07:34.940 --> 07:35.810
You opened it, didn't you?

07:35.810 --> 07:36.590
Yeah, i did.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.210
Your computer?

07:37.210 --> 07:37.860
Destroyed.

07:37.860 --> 07:38.680
So you're the only one.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.370
I don 't get it, bryce.

07:39.370 --> 07:40.190
Why'd you do it?

07:40.470 --> 07:41.590
Why'd you send me the intersect?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.110
Then, why did you destroy it?

07:43.110 --> 07:45.660
And last up: how the hell are you still alive?

07:45.660 --> 07:46.800
It's complicated.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.430
Who saved you?

07:48.050 --> 07:48.850
They did.

07:48.850 --> 07:49.990
They saved you?

07:50.270 --> 07:51.020
Did they?

07:51.410 --> 07:53.140
Could you be any more cryptic?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.380
Can i get a name, a place, a something?

07:57.710 --> 07:58.440
Come here.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.640
Don't do that.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.270
I'm sorry, chuck.

08:03.980 --> 08:04.640
Untie me!

08:05.580 --> 08:06.460
Untie...

08:06.920 --> 08:09.280
Okay...Hey!
Bryce!

08:09.280 --> 08:09.910
No!

08:11.060 --> 08:12.310
Sarah, what are you doing here?

08:15.610 --> 08:16.540
Hello, casey.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.310

08:54.420 --> 08:54.930
Stand down!

08:55.250 --> 08:56.010
Don't do this, bryce.

08:56.690 --> 08:57.930
We're all on the same side here.

08:57.930 --> 08:58.770
What side is that?

08:59.060 --> 08:59.690
I've got a shot.

08:59.690 --> 09:00.380
No, you don't.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.200
You'll be fine.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.440
No shooting!
No shooting!

09:02.440 --> 09:03.490
I'm susceptible to bullets.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.030
The access code!

09:06.380 --> 09:07.790
I#ll kill him, sarah!

09:08.620 --> 09:11.170
Between you and me, i think he means it.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.790
Five-one-six-zero-two.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.020
Sarah?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.080
You knew i wouldn't do it, right?

09:27.460 --> 09:28.110
No!

09:28.830 --> 09:30.070
No, i did not know that.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.060
How would i know that, bryce?

09:31.060 --> 09:32.030
What are you trying to do?

09:32.030 --> 09:32.900
What's sarah doing here?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.390
She's protecting me, okay.

09:34.390 --> 09:35.170
And so is casey.

09:35.170 --> 09:35.840
We're the good guys.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.830
Look, you need to stop this right now, 
before someone, namely me, gets hurt.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.600
Too soon.

09:41.150 --> 09:42.150
We're slowing down.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.090
We don't have to do the whole thing.

09:45.650 --> 09:46.500
Wait, don't, don't...

09:47.460 --> 09:48.450
Stop this elevator...

09:49.770 --> 09:50.420
Bryce.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.600
Who's your friend?

10:00.760 --> 10:01.800
You step back.

10:02.160 --> 10:02.690
Okay.

10:03.580 --> 10:05.550
I wouldn't want you to kill some random person.

10:06.570 --> 10:07.970
I'd feel just terrible.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.450
Tell your people that i'm gone.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.510
This is your chance, bryce.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.150
This is me being reasonable.

10:13.710 --> 10:14.210
Let's go.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.450
Let's be friends again.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.660
We were never friends.

10:17.180 --> 10:17.940
Ouch.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.440
Now my feelings are hurt.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.090
You're gonna run, aren't you?

10:24.210 --> 10:24.970
Good.

10:31.740 --> 10:32.780
Who was that?

10:33.950 --> 10:34.830
Nobody.

10:36.490 --> 10:37.520
What's fulcrum?

10:38.820 --> 10:39.850
Where did you hear that?

10:41.260 --> 10:42.220
The intersect.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.600
I have these flashes.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.060
I was right-- you can remember its intel.

10:48.930 --> 10:49.850
Is it always that fast?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.260
What is fulcrum, bryce?

10:51.260 --> 10:52.680
Who are they and how do they know you?

10:53.520 --> 10:54.350
This is my stop.

10:54.350 --> 10:55.570
No, no, no, no.
No, no, wait!

10:55.570 --> 10:57.330
I have questions, i have millions of questions.

10:57.330 --> 11:00.050
Chuck, this is gonna sting a little.

11:02.110 --> 11:02.790
Tell sarah...

11:04.330 --> 11:05.500
It's hard to say good-bye.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.500
Chuck.

11:13.530 --> 11:14.470
Hey, chuck.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.090
Not pretty!

11:26.500 --> 11:27.400
Ugly!

11:30.590 --> 11:31.590
It wasn't a full dose.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.810
It'll be out of your system in a few hours.

11:34.550 --> 11:35.070
Thanks.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.300
I think i can handle it from here.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.580
So, are you and casey 
gonna go after bryce?

11:40.000 --> 11:40.500
No.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.800
Bryce is probably halfway 
around the world by now.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.750
It's someone else's job to find him.

11:45.030 --> 11:49.570
Sarah, this is bryce larkin we're talking 
about here-- your old flame, my old nemesis.

11:49.570 --> 11:50.490
We have to do something.

11:51.190 --> 11:53.050
We each have our own assignment.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.080
Right.

11:54.570 --> 11:56.180
And i'm yours, so what...

11:56.460 --> 11:57.400
What does this mean...

11:58.190 --> 11:59.160
For us?

11:59.610 --> 12:00.320
Nothing.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.390
You're protected.

12:01.390 --> 12:02.040
No.

12:02.510 --> 12:03.710
For us.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.160
Our fake relationship-- i mean, 
you and bryce were...

12:07.890 --> 12:09.730
You're really not making this easy.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.850
Hey.Hey, sis.

12:11.850 --> 12:13.840
Oh, hi.Hey.
Hey, sarah.

12:13.940 --> 12:14.870
It's good to see you.

12:14.870 --> 12:15.710
You, too.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.750
Are you coming to thanksgiving?

12:19.650 --> 12:20.410
Of course.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.350
On black friday, it comes down to us.

12:29.590 --> 12:30.620
Crowd control.

12:31.100 --> 12:31.840
Okay?

12:31.840 --> 12:32.940
Little test here.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.040
Jeff, emergency in sector two-- move!

12:36.040 --> 12:37.200
Nice work, jeff, nice work.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.940
Lester, converge on jeff's position.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.430
Sector one.Move now.
Go!

12:40.810 --> 12:43.050
People's lives are at stake here, man.

12:43.470 --> 12:44.710
Good hustle, les.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.910
Anna, we cannot lose the doors, okay?

12:46.910 --> 12:49.000
If we lose the doors, we've lost the battle.

12:49.000 --> 12:49.670
Got it?

12:50.410 --> 12:51.140
All right.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.140
You look beautiful today, by the way.

12:53.140 --> 12:53.840
Chuck!

12:53.840 --> 12:55.100
Yes, morgan, yes, i'm right here.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.550
Hey, pal, yeah, listen, 
everybody's moving way too slow.

12:57.550 --> 13:01.610
If they don't shape up, if we lose 
control of the store, we are gonna 
have a pineapple situation.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.280
What's a pineapple situation?

13:04.280 --> 13:05.320
Morgan: never say that word.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.180
- You just...
- It's a black swan.x

13:07.580 --> 13:09.860
It's an impossible event that 
changes everything.

13:09.860 --> 13:12.690
In case something terrible happens-- 
nuclear strike, earthquake-

13:12.690 --> 13:16.650
- anyone of qou could initiate a full 
buy more evacuation by uttering one word.

13:16.650 --> 13:17.520
Pineapple.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.780
The word that cannot be spoken.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.710
I really just want to say "pineapple.

13:21.710 --> 13:24.620
- pineapples are fun-- my dad 
used to throw them at me.
- Pineapple.Pineapple.

13:24.620 --> 13:25.590
Seriously?

13:25.590 --> 13:26.380
Wow.

13:28.010 --> 13:29.220
What's the matter?
Who is it?

13:29.420 --> 13:30.250
Oh, it's ellie.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.690
She's in túanksgiving panic mode.

13:31.690 --> 13:32.660
I got to stop by the store.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.530
- See you kidc later.
- Later.

13:34.530 --> 13:35.520
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.750
Chuck, where you...
Come on, dude, what about bl...

13:37.080 --> 13:38.650
What about black friday?

13:42.960 --> 13:43.610
Okay.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.730
Captain: chuck, get ready for some turkey.

13:52.150 --> 13:53.040
What are you doing here?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.110
Well, your sister invited me to dinner.

13:56.110 --> 13:56.620
Really?

13:56.710 --> 13:57.380
Thanks.

13:57.910 --> 13:58.720
Did you find everything?

13:58.720 --> 13:59.750
Yeah, i-i did.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.460
Yeah, but i need to talk to you...

14:01.460 --> 14:04.220
I need to talk to you about something later, later.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.530
Um, hey, hey.

14:07.650 --> 14:08.160
Sorry.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.100
Uh, i have a question for you.

14:10.490 --> 14:14.690
Um, what-what do you think bryce 
meant when he said, "casey, care to...

14:14.690 --> 14:15.890
Care to try again?

14:16.260 --> 14:20.750
" 'cause call me crazy, but i got the 
weirdest feeling like it was you who killed him.

14:20.940 --> 14:21.840
Good guess.

14:23.000 --> 14:23.550
Are you ser...

14:23.550 --> 14:24.770
Does sarah know about that?

14:24.870 --> 14:26.190
It's in my report.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.580
Why would you...

14:28.380 --> 14:30.120
Do that?
Why did you kill bryce?x

14:30.280 --> 14:30.970
Orders.

14:31.930 --> 14:34.670
Your old nemesis is a very dangerous 
human being, cúuck.

14:34.670 --> 14:37.180
You get a chance to shoot 
bryce larkin, you shoot to kill.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.920
Guys, no shoptalk tonight.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.060
We got a bird to eat.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.870
Hey, john, can you help me 
stuff this monster?

14:43.630 --> 14:44.330
Cosmo?

14:44.800 --> 14:45.760
Thank you, john.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.040
He's so sweet.

14:47.370 --> 14:48.360
Lice honey.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.910
Uh, sis, morgan is 
bringing somebody tonight.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.900
Like, a real someone or an 
imaginary someone?

14:53.900 --> 14:56.940
Uh, real, actually, very real, 
and she's very nice.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.980
- And, ui...
- "she"?

14:59.580 --> 15:00.600
You said "she.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.460
" yes.

15:01.830 --> 15:02.870
Yes.
Anna.x

15:02.870 --> 15:03.970
Morgan's girlfriend.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.610
There could be a little issue, though, 
because she knows about you and morgan.

15:08.810 --> 15:09.700
What are you talking about?

15:12.420 --> 15:13.720
Just remember, it's not my fault.

15:16.490 --> 15:18.270
Ah, hello, sarah and my other friends!

15:18.270 --> 15:19.180

16:03.940 --> 16:05.440
There's no marshmallows on 
my sweet potapoes.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.920
It's morgan's favorite number two side dish.

16:09.830 --> 16:12.460
I'm sorry, i must have forgot.

16:12.460 --> 16:13.840
Thanksgiving is ruined.

16:14.210 --> 16:15.030

16:16.540 --> 16:19.650
Wait( that's my bad, because i did

16:36.160 --> 16:38.380
One girlish scream from me, and they 
go into combat mode.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.480
Chuck, what happened to you?

16:51.670 --> 16:55.360
Guy who wanted to be the software 
billionaire-- bill gates with style.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.850
You got me kicked out of stanford, bryce.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.030

16:58.030 --> 17:00.820

17:00.820 --> 17:02.070
Why would i help you?

17:02.070 --> 17:03.400
Because of fulcrum.

17:03.910 --> 17:06.400
That guy in the elevator, Íhe works for them.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.560
And they want the intersect, chuck.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.330
Do you like it?

17:36.350 --> 17:38.300
Very much.
It's devastating.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.550
Devastatingly good.

17:39.550 --> 17:40.410
Does anyone else want some?

17:40.410 --> 17:42.910

I'm impressed.

17:46.030 --> 17:47.090
You work out?

17:47.940 --> 17:49.560
Yeah, work keeps me in shape.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.380
How many calories do you think 
you're going to burn at the buy more, john?

17:53.130 --> 17:58.300
Bryce larkin is in my bedroom.

17:59.050 --> 18:00.790
Captain: you look like a guy who 
needs an adventure.

18:00.790 --> 18:03.680
Two words: water sports.

18:05.120 --> 18:05.700
ãExcuse me.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.500
Sweetheart, is thút, um, tartar sauce?

18:29.380 --> 18:30.340
You're getting rusty.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.730
Bryce, i have a gun-- do i need to use it?

18:32.730 --> 18:33.620
I'm unarmed.

18:34.350 --> 18:35.140
And i'm sorry.

18:35.950 --> 18:39.590
Two dudes, one raft, whitewater rapids.

18:39.590 --> 18:41.330
I got some brochures i gave to chuck.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.700
Hey, chuckles, is those rafting brochures 
still in your room?

18:51.730 --> 18:53.560

18:53.940 --> 18:55.200
Because i'm not a rogue spy.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.500
Because intersect was a mission.

18:58.510 --> 18:59.380
Because, sarah...

19:00.870 --> 19:02.050
You're still in love with me.

19:28.830 --> 19:33.290
Captain: so, thanksgiving-- we're all 
supposed to say what we're thankful for.

19:33.290 --> 19:33.820
I'll start.

19:34.410 --> 19:39.590

19:51.350 --> 19:52.100
Chuck.

19:53.350 --> 20:00.780
I'm thankful that bryce larkin is dead 
and is not currently with my new girlfriend.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.310
Please don't run.

20:19.070 --> 20:20.650
Casey, everything is under control.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.270
Chuck, are you okay?

potatoes covered in marshmallows.

20:36.630 --> 20:41.040
Okay, ellie, i got to tell you right now, 
i am getting really excited.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.130
Oh, god.

20:51.770 --> 20:52.660
Oh, god.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.770
Oh, my god.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.200
Oh, my god!

20:58.940 --> 20:59.540
So good.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.040
Good?

21:01.040 --> 21:01.540
So good.
Oh, my god!

21:01.540 --> 21:02.350
Fine, ellie!

21:02.830 --> 21:03.830
You can have him.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.030
What's the matter, baby?

21:07.370 --> 21:08.170
Seriously?

21:08.940 --> 21:09.470
I'll go see.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.190
Honey, hold on a second.

21:11.860 --> 21:16.390
- Honey, no more family dinners, okay
- = what do you think about a destination cúristmas?

21:16.580 --> 21:18.400
Anna banana, come here.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.000
Leave me alone, morgan!

21:20.270 --> 21:20.880
Come on.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.890
He's gone.
Call it in from my place.

21:22.890 --> 21:23.690
I'll check out back.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.340
How did casey find out?

21:25.340 --> 21:26.690
I made a rash decision.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.670
You saw bryce kiss me, didn't you?

21:30.460 --> 21:32.740
I guess this means we're not 
getting back together.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.110
Sarah, why is someone in 
casey's apartment?

21:55.970 --> 21:56.920
Put it down, bryce.

22:00.170 --> 22:00.820
Sarah.

22:01.010 --> 22:02.100
Close the door, chuck.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.330
I'm closing the door.
I'm closing the door.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.870
I'm walking into the apartment.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.030
Please, do not shoot me.

22:11.870 --> 22:13.320
I need you to listen to me.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.250
Put it down, bryce.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.670
The intersect was a mission.

22:15.670 --> 22:20.600
I was recruited by an outfit called 
fulcrum, a special access group inside the cia.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.180
You're lying.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.060
We would know that.

22:23.060 --> 22:26.150
They knew who i was, my activation 
codes, my record.

22:26.150 --> 22:28.870
They ordered me to shed my agency 
contacts and go deep.

22:28.870 --> 22:33.060
Only then did i realize it was an internal 
strike to download and destroy the intersect.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.250
Fulcrum had plans for its intel.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.550
How can i trust you, bryce?

22:38.230 --> 22:39.570
I didn't mean to hurt you, sarah.

22:45.610 --> 22:46.720
I didn't know who to trust.

22:47.830 --> 22:48.530
Why chuck?

22:48.530 --> 22:49.790
Yeah, why chuck?

22:49.790 --> 22:51.330
I needed a friend who wasn't a spy.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.300
He wouldn't know anything about fulcrum, 
or the intersect, or sand wall.

23:02.870 --> 23:03.590
Sand wall.

23:04.450 --> 23:04.970
Sand wall.

23:04.970 --> 23:05.810
That was the name of the mission.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.910
Sarah, i think he's telling the truth.

23:08.350 --> 23:09.170
Did you flash?

23:09.570 --> 23:10.210
Yeah.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.650
I'm not rogue.

23:20.290 --> 23:21.610
- Casey, no!
- Casey, no!

23:37.500 --> 23:39.290
* bryce!
Bryce...

23:42.290 --> 23:43.830
????

23:44.120 --> 23:45.410
Casey, no.
Chuck flashed.

23:45.410 --> 23:46.220
Bryce isn#t rogue.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.200
You should aim for the head next time, casey.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.410
Hey, i'm o...I'm okay.
I'm fine.

23:54.410 --> 23:58.080
Just, you know, me.
Intersect guy.x

24:01.230 --> 24:03.160
I don't get it, bryce.
How are you alive?

24:04.060 --> 24:05.930
I don't know how they did it, 
if that's what you're asking.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.330
They probably used one of the 
european clinics.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.630
I don't remember it.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.160
But you know why they did it.

24:13.570 --> 24:14.080
Yeah.

24:15.210 --> 24:17.840
Well, should i pop some popcorn or 
beat the answer out of you?

24:18.200 --> 24:20.280
No thanks.
I'll talk.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.130
Darn it.

24:21.390 --> 24:22.670
You know the first part already.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.030
I downloaded the intersect intel and 
blew up the computer.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.730
Raced out of túe dni.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.880
Then, i ran into you, casey.

24:34.360 --> 24:35.640
So i'm on the ground.

24:35.990 --> 24:39.360
No white light, just casey staring down at me.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.420
They brought me back, but they 
weren't trying to save me.

24:46.420 --> 24:47.840
No, this was a fulcrum team.

24:48.540 --> 24:49.580
They wanted something.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.460
Bryce.

24:51.660 --> 24:52.280
Where are they?

24:52.280 --> 24:53.630
Where are the intersect files?

24:54.450 --> 24:55.560
Tell me, bryce.

24:56.450 --> 24:58.240
What happened to the intersect?

24:59.370 --> 25:01.780
Tell me, or i'll let you die again.

25:04.140 --> 25:04.990
I saw...

25:05.910 --> 25:06.860
I saw them.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.540
They're in me.

25:12.620 --> 25:13.700
Save him.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.790
Whatever it takes, save him.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.230
Fulcrum thinks you're the intersect.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.050
They brought me back to take it out of me.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.330
That's why i need your help.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.270
We're going to help you?

25:25.270 --> 25:29.310
I need to turn myself in to the cia, 
but fulcrum has operatives in every agency.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.890
I need to know that i'm being 
handed over to the real cia.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.030
I can do that.

25:33.830 --> 25:34.470
I can do that.

25:34.470 --> 25:38.550
I, i can be there at the transfer if i 
flash on whoever they send, they're fulcrum.If not...

25:39.540 --> 25:40.320
You're on your way home.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.760
It should work.

25:42.110 --> 25:42.900
Smart, chuck.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.220
They still need a place where the 
transfer can go down, public place, lot of people.

25:46.580 --> 25:47.380
Public spot...

25:48.030 --> 25:49.430
Lots of witnesses.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.540
I know a place.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.180
(customers clamoring okay, listen up.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.970
In three minutes, we let those animals in.

25:57.370 --> 26:00.450
If this was a zoo, i'd say run for your 
lives, but this is buy more.

26:01.010 --> 26:04.560
For those days where you did squat, 
this is where you make up for it.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.450
Don't let me down.

26:06.910 --> 26:09.920
This is the single most important 
day of our year.

26:13.490 --> 26:14.730
And my door is locked.

26:15.190 --> 26:16.610
Don't even think about knocking.

26:30.830 --> 26:31.650
Take one.

26:33.030 --> 26:34.130
Take only one.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.020
Hey, are we talking?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.230
Anna, what happened last.Ight?x

26:40.090 --> 26:41.470
It was a test, morgan.

26:41.470 --> 26:42.640
And you failed.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.670
Well, why are there tests?

26:44.670 --> 26:46.720
No, take only one!

26:46.720 --> 26:47.490
Take only oje.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.380
No, take only one.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.700
So, appliances are over there...

26:55.700 --> 26:56.370
All right?

26:56.370 --> 26:57.670
And electronics, you're already here.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.000
Sarah: we're entering the store.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.090
The cia pickup should be here in two minutes.

27:07.130 --> 27:08.750
Excuse me, i'm just looking for camera bags.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.840
Cameras.Cameras are just over here.
So if you want to look...

27:28.250 --> 27:28.950
Do i know you?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.690
Wow, dude.

27:31.690 --> 27:32.550
No, i'm sorry, man.

27:32.550 --> 27:35.880
You...You look just like this guy my 
best friend used to go to stanford with.

27:37.450 --> 27:39.460
Uh, sorry, i-i went to penn.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.580
Um...I'll take it as a compliment.

27:41.580 --> 27:44.370
Well, you shouldn't actually, 'cause this 
guy bryce was a real douche.

27:44.910 --> 27:46.920
You know, he got my buddy chuck 
kicked out of stanford.

27:46.920 --> 27:47.840
He ruined his life.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.880
I don't know why he did it to the nicest 
guy in the world.You know?

27:51.260 --> 27:53.000
Anywho, happy holidays.

27:53.000 --> 27:53.880
Jeff and lester.

27:53.880 --> 27:54.810
They can't do it.

27:54.810 --> 27:55.530
They're hiding.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.580
The cia pickup is here.
Chuck, do your pass.x

28:24.960 --> 28:26.110
Welcome to buy more.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.260
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

28:32.260 --> 28:35.360
There were no flashes, 
so the cia guys are legit.

28:44.310 --> 28:45.600
What are you guys doing?

28:46.340 --> 28:48.090
Dude, it is not safe out there.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.330
Someone touched me.

28:49.330 --> 28:50.060
I don't care.

28:50.060 --> 28:51.700
You both have jobs to do.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.520
Big mike: morgan, registers are down.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.870
I need jeff up there to fix them.

28:56.870 --> 28:58.000
All right.I'm on it, boss.x

28:58.950 --> 29:00.230
Jeff, the registers are down.

29:01.030 --> 29:01.840
I can't do it, man.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.920
Dude, you have to.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.970
You're the only guy old enough to 
understand how the register work.

29:04.970 --> 29:06.550
Okay?
They're from the '80s.

29:06.910 --> 29:07.640
I can't.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.750
Listen to me.
You're scared.

29:08.750 --> 29:09.360
I'm scared.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.360
We're all scared, but the store is 
depending on you.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.210
If people can't check out, people can't leave.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.850
People can't leave, more people will fill in.

29:15.850 --> 29:16.880
If more people fill in, jeff...

29:17.190 --> 29:20.240
- The store will explode.
- The store will explode!

29:20.240 --> 29:21.630
I got to get 'em here!

29:21.630 --> 29:24.190
No, jeff!No!
No!It's a trick!

29:25.620 --> 29:27.430
Excuse me, sir, can i help you?

29:27.950 --> 29:29.130
Yes, thank you.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.340
These hd screens almost 
look like the real thing.

29:32.340 --> 29:33.610
Yeah, they do, huh?

29:37.470 --> 29:39.510
You know, i didn't maan to 
offend you, last night.

29:39.960 --> 29:40.980
About living with your sister.

29:41.740 --> 29:44.390
Sarah told me about your team, 
what you've done together.

29:45.090 --> 29:46.800
And you're still the superspy, right?

29:46.800 --> 29:47.430
It's nothing.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.630
I got one friend in this world.

29:51.820 --> 29:53.710
You got a home and a store full of them.

29:55.390 --> 29:56.560
So what happenc now, bryce?

29:56.560 --> 29:58.220
You just disappear all over again?

29:58.680 --> 29:59.740
That's what i do well.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.440
Thanks, chuck.

30:03.060 --> 30:03.710
For everything.

30:08.480 --> 30:08.980
Yeah.

30:10.010 --> 30:10.810
You're welcome.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.830
I'm taking him in, chuck.
You stay here.

30:15.230 --> 30:15.770
Right.

30:18.340 --> 30:19.730
Stay in the store, chuck.

30:31.340 --> 30:32.090
Are we good?

30:33.790 --> 30:34.740
Yeah, we're clear.

30:35.490 --> 30:36.080
No.

30:37.290 --> 30:38.060
Us.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.430
I thought you were dead, bryce.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.590
Come back with me.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.980
I have my ascignment.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.320
You were never good at this...

30:51.720 --> 30:53.000
The saying your feelings part.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.330
Well, i don't like to talk much.

31:04.970 --> 31:06.570
Excuse me, can i get some service?

31:08.910 --> 31:10.670
You're charles bartowski, aren't you?

31:11.440 --> 31:12.550
We met the other day.

31:13.730 --> 31:14.410
Did we?

31:15.650 --> 31:16.890
So how, how can i, uh...

31:17.290 --> 31:18.130
How can i help you?

31:18.560 --> 31:19.570
I'm looking for a computer.

31:19.570 --> 31:22.250
You might be familiar with this one.
????

31:32.360 --> 31:34.490
/i> you don't seem to understand 
the situation, charles.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.700
You think that all these witnesses are a 
guarantee that nothing's gonna happen to you?

31:38.700 --> 31:40.360
You couldn't be more wrong.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.470
I, i am so slammed right now.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.150
It's really busy.

31:45.150 --> 31:46.360
So i should probably get back to work.

31:46.360 --> 31:50.000
??????????
And sarah wadker five minutes ago.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.500
I have seven trained killers 
stationed throughout the store.

31:52.690 --> 31:53.710
If you look over there...

31:54.510 --> 31:57.500
You can also see that my men 
have neutralized mr.Casey.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.020
See, here's the thing, ÌCharles.

31:59.200 --> 32:04.680
Nothing stops me from ãfulfilling my 
orders-- innocents...Civilians.

32:04.680 --> 32:09.720
If you make me, i'll execute every 
last person in this place.

32:22.080 --> 32:22.600
It's done.

32:24.460 --> 32:25.940
Yeah, we'll need about two 
minutes to groom the area.

32:35.230 --> 32:35.820
Where is he?

32:36.070 --> 32:36.670
Who?

32:36.670 --> 32:37.760
Their boss, tommy.

32:38.300 --> 32:38.990
Chuck.

32:47.070 --> 32:48.610
Chuck, the registers are down.

32:48.610 --> 32:49.740
I can't get them back up.

32:50.110 --> 32:51.110
What should i do?

32:51.490 --> 32:53.650
You say more than one word 
and i'll kill him right here.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.950
Pineapple.

33:00.300 --> 33:00.820
Let's go.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.180
Pineapple.

33:04.740 --> 33:06.440
Hey, dude, don't say that word, okay?

33:06.440 --> 33:08.600
It doesn't have any meaning if 
you keep joking with it, okay?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.110
No, i didn't say it.

33:10.730 --> 33:11.440
Chuck did.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.080
- Chuck?.
- Chuck.

33:17.010 --> 33:19.560
Ladies and gentlemen, 
we have an emergency.

33:19.560 --> 33:23.220
I need everyone to leave the 
store in an orderly fashion.

33:23.220 --> 33:25.260
Anna, pineapple.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.670
Grimes.

34:06.710 --> 34:07.610
* it's a mistake!

34:07.610 --> 34:08.760
Hey, hey, no!

34:09.199 --> 34:10.260
The store's not on fire!

34:27.679 --> 34:29.190
I got you.
I got you.

34:29.540 --> 34:31.580
Morgan, what are you dking?

34:32.130 --> 34:32.830
Put me down.

34:33.050 --> 34:34.120
I will not put you down.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.330
Morgan, put me down.

34:40.770 --> 34:41.520
Code black.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.679
Hostiles in the buy more.

34:42.949 --> 34:44.949
I need a containment team right away.

34:47.040 --> 34:47.730
Are you kiúding me?

34:47.730 --> 34:48.960
Some kid could find this.

34:56.670 --> 34:57.710
Lock the doors.

35:04.730 --> 35:05.670
Stay down, chuck.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.310
This is when the shooting starts.

35:08.270 --> 35:09.600
Right...
Right now?

36:07.100 --> 36:08.190
They really are great.

36:14.750 --> 36:15.300
Come on, chuck, let's go.

36:15.300 --> 36:19.250
I'm really getting sick and tired of 
being pulled around by you all the time.

36:20.460 --> 36:21.200
Where's chuck?

36:21.510 --> 36:22.370
Over here.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.910
Let him go...
Now.

36:26.220 --> 36:27.820
Does this look like my first time?

36:27.820 --> 36:30.200
Isn't it somebody else's turn 
to be the human shield?

36:30.630 --> 36:31.880
Tommy: stay there, bryce.

36:32.650 --> 36:33.510
You all right, chuck?

36:33.510 --> 36:34.720
Does it look like i'm all right?

36:34.720 --> 36:36.020
I need to ask you something.

36:36.020 --> 36:36.790
Shoot.

36:37.140 --> 36:38.110
Not you, please.

36:39.150 --> 36:40.610
Khi-ja?

36:42.160 --> 36:43.220
Khi-ja?

36:43.370 --> 36:44.130
Gho-be?

36:45.410 --> 36:46.210
Khi-ja.

36:47.570 --> 36:48.450
Sorry, chuck.

36:51.870 --> 36:52.370
Hi.

36:54.230 --> 36:55.330
What did you say to him?

36:55.880 --> 36:56.720
Ask him.

36:58.120 --> 36:58.830
Hey, chuck.

37:02.130 --> 37:03.250
Chuck, come on, wake up.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.160
Come on, hey.

37:07.170 --> 37:08.120
Khi-ja...

37:08.590 --> 37:11.500
Khi-ja.
Yes.Yes...

37:13.060 --> 37:14.420
I am wearing a vest.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.070
That stings a little bit.

37:25.810 --> 37:26.870
Seriously, that is...

37:27.330 --> 37:33.950
Not fair to not tell someone how 
much a bulletproof vest still hurts.

37:33.950 --> 37:35.500
???????????????

37:35.500 --> 37:37.780
Hey, stand down.
He's one of us.

37:38.120 --> 37:38.910
let's go.

37:58.190 --> 37:58.690
Dude...

37:59.970 --> 38:01.420
Why'd you just carry anna out?

38:01.750 --> 38:04.410
She could have just walked, no?

38:04.810 --> 38:05.580
Sorry abgut that.

38:05.580 --> 38:08.220
Morgan, you passed.

38:08.220 --> 38:08.950
I passed?

38:09.350 --> 38:10.070
Big mike: grimes!

38:12.000 --> 38:14.180
You just ruined the most important 
shopping day of the year.

38:14.180 --> 38:15.440
For what?For what?

38:15.440 --> 38:17.080
- Do you know what you are, grimes?
- No.

38:17.590 --> 38:18.160
What?

38:18.600 --> 38:19.890
There was a gas leak in the store.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.450
- Gas?
- Yes, sir.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.920
And whoever evacuated probably 
saved a lot of people.

38:24.810 --> 38:26.830
It willtake us a few hours to clean 
all this up, so we'd appreciate

38:26.830 --> 38:28.910
 if you'd keep everybody out of here 
until we give you the say-so.

38:34.930 --> 38:36.310
Is it straight?
Does it look good?

38:41.320 --> 38:42.150
What are we going to do?

38:42.930 --> 38:45.110
Relax, chuck.
These are nsa cleaners.

38:45.110 --> 38:47.290
They'll have the buy more back 
to normal in a jiffy.

38:47.290 --> 38:48.530
Chuck: what's happening with bryce?

38:48.750 --> 38:51.030
He's in there giving his report 
to general beckman.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.340
It would appear, 
i have an new assignment.

39:04.740 --> 39:05.720
As a maitre d'?

39:06.090 --> 39:08.050
Actually, it's a consulate dinner.

39:08.050 --> 39:11.760
They want me to go after fulcrum-- 
on my own, off the radar.

39:12.610 --> 39:13.650
Sounds like heaven.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.430
That means bryce larkin is dead.

39:16.150 --> 39:17.820
And he's going to stay that way this time.

39:19.660 --> 39:20.420
Good-bye, chuck.

39:21.650 --> 39:22.700
This is so weird.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.250
Where you going to go?
Who you going to be?

39:25.470 --> 39:28.300
Sorry, not even you can know.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.210
Sarah...

39:33.510 --> 39:35.040
We'll always have omaha.

39:48.970 --> 39:49.490
Hey.

39:49.960 --> 39:50.460
What?

39:50.460 --> 39:52.710
Um, we have some turkey leftovers.

39:52.710 --> 39:57.990
Actually, we have a lot of turkey left over, 
so i was wondering if i could interest you in 
some sandwiches or something.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.340
Thanks, but work to do.

39:59.720 --> 40:00.330
Right.

40:00.330 --> 40:01.490
Right, okay then.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.100
Hey, casey, casey, casey, casey.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.090
Yeah?

40:06.090 --> 40:06.920
Sorry.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.790
What did bryce mean by omaha?

40:11.790 --> 40:15.300
Outside of it being some weird 
casablanca reference?

40:15.880 --> 40:16.990
Probably a code.

40:17.330 --> 40:18.770
Contact point of some sort.

40:19.510 --> 40:21.630
Okay, why would sarah need that?

40:22.250 --> 40:23.650
Bryce is going deep, chuck.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.390
No messages out.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.840
If sarah wants to join up with him 
she has to do it now.

40:29.430 --> 40:30.480
Sarah's leaving?

40:31.150 --> 40:32.380
Don't worry, chuck.

40:32.780 --> 40:34.320
When sarah's gone, 
we'll get you a new girl.

40:40.540 --> 40:41.180
Oh, man...

40:42.690 --> 40:43.680
This is great, right?

40:44.370 --> 40:47.780
Two buddies, a couple cold turkey 
sandwiches and all the mayo you could want.

40:48.840 --> 40:49.730
You all right?

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
