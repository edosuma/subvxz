00:11.133 --> 00:13.033
So, Max, I hear
it's your six-month anniversary.

00:13.133 --> 00:14.467
What are you gonna get Alison?

00:17.567 --> 00:18.900
- Yeah, no, thanks.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.033
She's not really into eating
food out of people's backpacks.

00:22.133 --> 00:23.467
- But I am, bro.

00:23.567 --> 00:24.633
Oooh, combo.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.600
- Oh, here she comes.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.167
Hey, there you are.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.100
I saved us the best table.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.533
- Oh, I didn't know
Splat Burger had a best table.

00:39.267 --> 00:41.833
- Oh, look, Evan's on a date.

00:41.933 --> 00:45.500
It's with a lizard,
but still...love.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.500
- Shall we share the cheesecake,
my little pookie bear?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.100
- I just love this
romantic side of you, Max.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.800
You're bursting with emotion.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.433
- Oh, something's gonna burst.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.600
Watch this.

01:13.167 --> 01:14.967
- Happy anniversary!

01:15.067 --> 01:16.367
What'd you get me?

01:18.467 --> 01:20.567
- *

01:20.667 --> 01:23.600
* What you see
is not what you get *

01:23.700 --> 01:27.067
* Living our lives
with a secret *

01:27.133 --> 01:30.333
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

01:30.433 --> 01:33.533
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

01:33.633 --> 01:37.200
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

01:37.300 --> 01:40.300
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

01:40.400 --> 01:42.067
* This isn't make-believe

01:42.100 --> 01:43.467
* It's our reality

01:43.567 --> 01:46.700
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

01:46.800 --> 01:48.167
* And stay out of trouble

01:48.267 --> 01:50.833
* Living a double life *

01:55.867 --> 01:57.167
- All right, Nora.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.533
Whoever scores this next point
is champion of the universe.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.300
- And whoever loses has
to lick the driveway.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.700
- Oh, no, it went
into Mrs. Wong's yard.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.167
- I'll see
if I can find the ball.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.767
You start kissing cement.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.900
- Billy,
stop eating ants again.

02:22.067 --> 02:23.400
- We lost another ball.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.533
- Oh, don't worry,
your big sis will get it back.

02:27.533 --> 02:29.933
Well, that was easy.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.667
- Mom! Dad!

02:31.767 --> 02:36.833
Mrs. Wong sent another ball
to ball heaven!

02:38.367 --> 02:40.067
- Yeah, she left
her mark on it.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.900
- Somebody needs to change
that lady's diaper.

02:48.367 --> 02:50.300
- You guys ever wondered
why Mrs. Wong is so mean?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.433
- Huh-uh.
- Nope.

02:51.533 --> 02:55.100
- I'm pretty sure
she's an actual witch.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.567
- Think about it.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.667
Have any of us ever stopped
to stay, "Hello, Mrs. Wong?"

02:58.767 --> 03:00.900
Or "How's your day, Mrs. Wong?"

03:01.067 --> 03:02.500
Or "Mrs. Wong,
would you like to come over

03:02.600 --> 03:04.300
for some peach cobbler?"

03:06.100 --> 03:09.600
- I don't know,
something about a cobbler.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.733
- I'm saying maybe
if we were nice to Mrs. Wong

03:11.833 --> 03:14.200
she'd be nice to us in return.

03:14.300 --> 03:17.600
For example...oh,
what if we fix her fence?

03:17.700 --> 03:20.400
- Honey, some people
are just grouches.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.667
And it's best
to leave them alone.

03:22.767 --> 03:23.833
Why'd you bring up cobbler?

03:23.933 --> 03:26.200
Now I want cobbler.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.433
- *

03:28.533 --> 03:29.867
- MAX: Okay,
can I open them yet?

03:29.967 --> 03:32.200
What's this
big anniversary surprise?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.567
- A few more steps, and here.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.833
- My anniversary gift
is a bunch of dweebs?

03:40.700 --> 03:43.833
I hope you kept the receipt.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.267
- This isn't a gift.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.067
It's a prank-ter-vention.

03:47.167 --> 03:49.067
All of the people you have hurt
are here to confront you

03:49.167 --> 03:50.967
about your pranking problem.

03:51.067 --> 03:54.100
- No, there's no way
this is all of them.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.167
- Well, I'm not the only one

03:55.267 --> 03:56.600
who doesn't like your pranking,
Max.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.367
So you're going to sit down
and listen.

03:59.467 --> 04:03.067
Evan, would you
like to go first?

04:03.167 --> 04:05.767
- There's a thin line
between comedy and tragedy.

04:05.867 --> 04:08.533
Aristotle once said--
- Skip to the last card.

04:10.133 --> 04:13.200
- Max, your pranks are hurtful.
Please stop.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.800
- They're just harmless jokes.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.600
- You drew a permanent mustache
on Tonya Redecci.

04:20.733 --> 04:25.533
- Yeah, and she looks
Redecci-ulous.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.267
- And Howard never recovered
from that urinal incident.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.533
- Oh, come on, grape juice

04:29.633 --> 04:31.500
spraying out of the urinal
was funny.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.100
- Thanks to you,
I have to run home to pee.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.167
And sometimes...I don't make it.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.667
- Dude, you're only
encouraging me.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.567
All right, fine.

04:44.667 --> 04:48.733
I had no idea how much my pranks
hurt all of you.

04:48.833 --> 04:51.067
Sorry, guys.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.233
How 'bout I give you some...

04:53.333 --> 04:57.067
goodwill mints to make amends?

04:57.100 --> 04:58.700
- I'm so proud of you, Max.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.433
I didn't think
you'd be open to change,

05:00.533 --> 05:02.233
but I guess I was wrong.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.067
It's a trap!

05:09.167 --> 05:10.933
- This was fun.
We should do more of these.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.633
- Forget it. I'm done.

05:13.733 --> 05:15.167
What are you talking about?

05:15.267 --> 05:16.433
- I don't want to be with a guy

05:16.533 --> 05:18.967
who hurts people
just for laughs.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.100
Goodbye, Max.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.867
- Hold on, hold on.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.133
Okay, for you...

05:24.233 --> 05:26.533
I'll give up pranking.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.100
Seriously.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.967
- Max Thunderman
is gonna give up pranking?

05:31.067 --> 05:32.200
- Yes.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.367
Let's shake on it.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.800
- If I shake a fake hand,
so help me...

05:43.067 --> 05:44.900
- *

05:46.100 --> 05:48.100
- * There is a hag
whose heart is cold *

05:48.200 --> 05:52.067
- * Her name is Wong,
and she's real old *

05:52.100 --> 05:53.167
- All right, you guys
are kind of ruining

05:53.267 --> 05:57.067
the whole let's be nice
to Mrs. Wong thing.

05:57.133 --> 06:01.400
- Get out of my yard,
you tone-deaf hooligans.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.367
- Put down the pan, Mrs. Wong.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.833
We're just fixing your fence.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.333
- We also wonder that.

06:09.433 --> 06:10.867
- We're just being neighborly.

06:10.967 --> 06:13.200
- Uh, well, if you dummies
wanna work for free,

06:13.300 --> 06:16.900
it's on your smelly heads.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.067
- Cover me.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.433
I'm torching this fence.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.467
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:22.567 --> 06:24.367
Guys, this is gonna work, okay?

06:24.467 --> 06:27.100
After we're done, Mrs. Wong
will be the nicest neighbor

06:27.200 --> 06:29.600
and no longer
look at us like that.

06:32.067 --> 06:34.100
- *

06:35.767 --> 06:37.433
- Have to break.

06:37.533 --> 06:39.367
Have to break.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.467
How can you do this to me,
Alison?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.067
I can't take it.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.267
- Calm down.

06:43.367 --> 06:46.433
Here, maybe a blast
from the hose will cool you off.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.933
- Okay. Hit me.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.200
- Not funny, Colosso.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.600
I'm trying to quit pranking
once and for all.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.500
I really like Alison.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.500
And she's the only person

06:58.600 --> 06:59.667
I look forward
to seeing every day.

07:01.933 --> 07:05.133
Because it's working.

07:05.233 --> 07:06.400
- I just...

07:06.500 --> 07:07.633
I don't wanna lose her.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.733
- Well, if you're gonna quit
pranking,

07:09.833 --> 07:12.500
you need to go out
with a big bang.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.800
- You're right.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.167
Just one last big prank,
get it out of my system.

07:17.267 --> 07:20.600
And, Alison,
doesn't even have to know.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.667
- Wait!

07:21.767 --> 07:23.600
Let me wipe
that confetti off ya.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.400
- Yeah, I'm not gonna
walk back over there

07:25.500 --> 07:26.633
just so you can prank me again.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.633
- *

07:34.733 --> 07:36.500
- We bought new kickballs.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.100
- Phoebe was wrong.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.467
It doesn't feel good
to help others.

07:41.567 --> 07:44.233
It hurts!

07:44.333 --> 07:45.700
- No, you guys are wrong.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.933
I'm positive she'll see
her fence is nicely painted

07:48.067 --> 07:50.400
and give up her Wongy ways.

07:51.733 --> 07:52.800
- THUNDER MONITOR:
Alert, alert.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.400
Mrs. Wong approaching.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.300
Activating porch lasers.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.467
- No, Thunder Monitor, stop!

07:59.567 --> 08:02.667
Who programed in lasers
for Mrs. Wong?

08:02.767 --> 08:04.733
- Guilty, baby.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.733
- Hello, my favorite neighbors.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.333
- You know you're at
the Thundermans, right?

08:23.433 --> 08:25.933
- Oh, Barbara, you're so funny.

08:28.433 --> 08:29.667
I brought these treats

08:29.767 --> 08:32.100
to thank your kids
for fixing my fence.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.900
- Why, that was
very neighborly of you.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.200
I hope we can do more things
together in the future.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.667
- Oh, I agree.

08:39.767 --> 08:41.833
In fact, I'm having
a party tomorrow,

08:41.933 --> 08:44.467
and would love it
if all kids would come.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.767
- We would love to, Mrs. Wong.

08:45.867 --> 08:49.367
- Please, call me, Auntie Wong.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.500
- If these are
as good as they look,

08:53.600 --> 08:56.133
I'll call you whatever you want.

08:56.233 --> 08:59.067
- I'll see you kids tomorrow
at 3:30 sharp.

09:02.733 --> 09:06.133
- Well, look who was right
about Mrs. Wong.

09:06.233 --> 09:06.867
You were, Phoebe.

09:06.967 --> 09:07.800
Good job, Phoebe.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.100
Thank you, Phoebe.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.900
- *

09:13.067 --> 09:16.800
- Time to head home
to the wife and kids.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.333
If I say it enough times,
maybe it'll happen.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.433
Oh.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.800
Hello, free khakis.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.367
Huh?

09:28.467 --> 09:30.633
Uoh!

09:33.300 --> 09:35.700
- Ah, ah!

09:35.800 --> 09:37.133
You won't get away with this!

09:37.233 --> 09:40.333
No one laughs at Tag Bradford!

09:41.833 --> 09:44.367
- Stop laughing!

09:44.467 --> 09:46.133
Uh!

09:47.467 --> 09:49.067
- Then stop falling.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.400
- Uh, nothing.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.933
Very uneventful morning.

09:55.067 --> 09:59.433
- Someone pranked
Bradford hard.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.567
- When I find the troublemaker
in the red hat who did this,

10:02.667 --> 10:05.333
they are getting expelled!

10:05.433 --> 10:06.700
Locker search!

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
Starting with, uh--oh,
I don't know--

10:08.900 --> 10:10.300
Max Thunderman.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.600
- What would make you
think that?

10:14.700 --> 10:16.467
- Because all you do is pranks.

10:16.567 --> 10:17.533
And the real victim here is me

10:17.633 --> 10:19.100
for believing
that you would quit.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.467
- What, okay, hold on. Listen.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.100
- No, I'm done
listening to you.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.833
You're a liar
who can't be trusted.

10:26.933 --> 10:29.833
- Aw, poor baby
lost his sweetheart.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.300
Well, that rope
was the first thing

10:31.400 --> 10:33.000
that held me in a year.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.000
- You'll never find
that red hat in my locker.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.100
But you will in my backpack.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.800
- Oooh, free hat-zen.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.400
- Locker's clean.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.233
Now let's check your

10:55.333 --> 10:56.500
You!

10:58.767 --> 11:00.767
- Pack your bags,
exchange student,

11:00.867 --> 11:03.267
because you're going back
to Germany.

11:03.367 --> 11:06.467
Oh wait, let me put this
in terms you can understand.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.833
- *

11:18.467 --> 11:19.200
Max, I--

11:20.200 --> 11:21.333
I gotta go save my friend.

11:21.433 --> 11:22.767
- Hat-zen not mine.

11:22.867 --> 11:24.567
- Hey, Bradford!

11:24.667 --> 11:27.333
How do you know
he didn't just find that hat?

11:27.433 --> 11:28.067
He'd never buy it.

11:28.167 --> 11:30.633
Look at his boxy face.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.867
- His face is weird.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.700
But he's wearing that hat,
so he's guilty.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.667
I'm telling his host family
he's on the next bus to Germany.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.667
- Achoo!
- Gesundheit.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.400
- Watch your language,
filth mouth.

11:44.567 --> 11:48.833
- Wolfgang, this is so sad.

11:48.933 --> 11:50.400
Where are we gonna
get another drummer?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.167
What? He doesn't know
what we're saying.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.233
- Don't worry, buddy.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.067
I will not let you get expelled
and sent back to Germany

11:59.167 --> 12:02.833
over something I did...n't
see coming.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.400
No.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.133
But while I think of one,
you hide in my lair.

12:11.233 --> 12:13.367
Can't send you away
if they can't find you.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.633
- Danke.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.133
- Ooh, okay.

12:16.233 --> 12:17.267
Get it out of your system now,

12:17.367 --> 12:20.467
because there's no hugging
in my lair.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.200
- *

12:22.300 --> 12:26.267
- All right, Thundermans,
let's start this par-tay.

12:26.367 --> 12:29.867
In this yard that's emp-tay.

12:29.967 --> 12:32.900
- Worst party ever.

12:33.067 --> 12:34.600
- Maybe it's a surprise party.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.300
- Surprise! I'm out of here.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.567
- Whoa.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.067
Relax, the new, happy Wong

12:40.100 --> 12:41.667
just make a mistake
about the time.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.667
- Howdy, neighbors.

12:43.767 --> 12:44.567
- She said "howdy."

12:44.667 --> 12:47.067
She's changed so much.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.867
You said 3:30 sharp.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.467
Silly me.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.433
Everyone's coming at 4.

12:54.533 --> 12:55.600
But since you're here,

12:55.700 --> 12:58.267
how 'bout my favorite neighbors
help set up?

13:02.933 --> 13:05.067
We've been set up.

13:05.133 --> 13:08.267
- Some par-tay, Phoe-bey.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.600
- Relax, we're just here
a little early,

13:10.700 --> 13:11.967
so she's having us help out.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.567
It's not like
we're working the party.

13:18.267 --> 13:21.167
Okay, we might be
working the party.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.667
- *

13:25.833 --> 13:27.067
- All clear!

13:29.200 --> 13:30.367
All right, my parents
are at the movies,

13:30.467 --> 13:31.867
so we should be safe
from Bradford here.

13:35.133 --> 13:39.433
- Well, that explains
why that dog chased us home.

13:40.700 --> 13:41.600
- That could be him.

13:44.633 --> 13:46.667
- No, Bradford.

13:46.767 --> 13:47.867
You should go to my lair.

13:47.967 --> 13:50.867
He won't be able
to find you there.

13:50.967 --> 13:53.067
- Wee-zen!

13:54.633 --> 13:56.933
- Oh, and stay away
from my rabbit.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.267
He doesn't like people.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.300
Whoo.

14:04.933 --> 14:06.900
Alison

14:07.067 --> 14:08.100
- I came to apologize
for blaming you

14:08.200 --> 14:09.467
for doing that prank.

14:09.567 --> 14:11.600
- Oh, don't give it
a second thought.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.867
Thanks for stopping by.

14:12.967 --> 14:15.267
- Well, I just feel so bad
for calling you a liar.

14:15.367 --> 14:17.100
I mean, I should have
trusted you.

14:19.933 --> 14:22.200
Do I smell sausage?

14:22.300 --> 14:27.133
- My dad's
a cured meat enthusiast.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.300
- Well, I believe that.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.333
Anyway, clearly,
I'm the one with the problem.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.167
I mean, after all the trouble
you went through to change,

14:34.267 --> 14:36.433
I have to be better for you.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.067
I'm sorry.

14:38.133 --> 14:39.500
Do you forgive me?

14:41.367 --> 14:44.667
- Oooh, cursed
your trusting eyes.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.067
I can't do this.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.867
I'm the one
who pranked Bradford.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.267
- Now they're angry eyes.

14:53.367 --> 14:56.067
Okay, I tried to give up pranks
cold turkey.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.233
But it was just too hard.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.400
So I did one last prank,
then Wolfgang got blamed.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.600
- So...you let your friend
take the fall,

15:03.700 --> 15:06.133
and then you lied to me?

15:06.233 --> 15:08.567
- Yes, but in my defense,

15:08.667 --> 15:12.333
I am hiding him from Bradford
in my lair.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.633
- I'm sorry.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.967
I finally understand
what you're trying to say.

15:24.067 --> 15:27.533
But it took someone getting hurt
for it to finally sink in.

15:27.633 --> 15:30.067
- I showed you a room full
of people who got hurt by you.

15:30.133 --> 15:31.767
- I meant someone I care about.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.167
The point is...

15:36.267 --> 15:37.900
I never wanna prank again.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.233
- BRADFORD: Open up, Thunderman!

15:40.333 --> 15:42.100
- It's Bradford.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.633
- BRADFORD: I know
Wolfgang is in there.

15:43.733 --> 15:46.533
I got a call from some guy
named Dr. Colosso.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.233
- *

15:50.333 --> 15:53.467
- Tell me, Mrs. Wong, why should
the PTA board hire you

15:53.567 --> 15:55.500
to supply the school
with hot lunches?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.367
- I can tell you
it has nothing to do

15:57.467 --> 15:58.967
with all the money
you're offering.

16:01.267 --> 16:04.433
I've always loved children,
and they love me.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.700
Why else would they help
their Auntie Wong

16:06.800 --> 16:07.867
with this party?

16:10.267 --> 16:13.233
- Guys...Mrs. Wong is using us

16:13.333 --> 16:15.667
to look good
in front of the PTA.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.567
You guys are right,
she'll be never be nice.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.800
- Look who's finally
on the obvious train.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.233
You, you!

16:22.333 --> 16:24.467
- I deserve that.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.567
Now let's give Wong
what she deserves.

16:26.667 --> 16:29.267
The PTA thinks she loves kids.

16:29.367 --> 16:30.867
Let's show them
the real Mrs. Wong.

16:30.967 --> 16:33.100
Billy, super speed home
and grab us some balls.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.100
- On it.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.500
Hold the crab cakes.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.967
- Crabs make bad cake.

16:45.867 --> 16:46.833
- All right.

16:48.667 --> 16:52.167
Uh, Auntie Wong, can we please
take a break to go play?

16:53.767 --> 16:55.367
That makes it sound like
you're working,

16:55.467 --> 16:58.200
which clearly she isn't.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.067
Go play, go.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.233
Exercise and sunshine

17:02.333 --> 17:04.767
are so important
for growing children.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.933
- Sorry, Mrs. Wong.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.833
- Kids will be kids.

17:11.933 --> 17:14.833
- Yes, they will.

17:14.933 --> 17:18.833
Anyway, I prefer to be paid
with a comically large check.

17:23.067 --> 17:25.767
- Careful, you...

17:25.867 --> 17:28.533
adorable children.

17:28.633 --> 17:32.933
I will give you
so many hugs later.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.267
- We almost have her.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.767
Let's crack this Wong.

17:36.867 --> 17:39.467
- Uh! Ow!

17:39.567 --> 17:42.733
Children, you must be more--ow!

17:42.833 --> 17:45.067
Ah!

17:45.133 --> 17:46.233
That's it!

17:46.333 --> 17:48.300
You Thundermans
are horrible creatures!

17:48.400 --> 17:52.100
I'll destroy you
and your little balls, too!

17:52.200 --> 17:53.800
Ugh!

17:56.567 --> 17:58.633
- You're the horrible one,
Mrs. Wong.

17:58.733 --> 18:00.600
You obviously have no patience
with children,

18:00.700 --> 18:02.900
and you will not
be getting this job.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.300
- Uh.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.967
Oh, no.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.567
Come back.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.333
You don't have to like children
to feed them.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.567
- *

18:15.667 --> 18:16.900
- BRADFORD: Open up, Thunderman.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.500
- I'm sorry, Alison,
this is all my fault.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.233
I'll go confess to Bradford.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.600
- No, Max, stop.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.167
I wanted you to learn your
lesson about pranking,

18:24.267 --> 18:25.500
not get expelled.

18:25.600 --> 18:30.600
- BRADFORD: Give me the boy!

18:30.700 --> 18:33.400
- Okay, don't get
all angry eyes on me.

18:33.500 --> 18:37.167
But I could prank Bradford
to get rid of him.

18:37.267 --> 18:38.300
I've got this whole house rigged

18:38.400 --> 18:40.333
in case my family
turns against me.

18:40.433 --> 18:41.367
- Absolutely not.

18:41.467 --> 18:42.667
Pranking has never solved
anything.

18:44.067 --> 18:48.267
I see her stupid bike
made out of recycled cans!

18:48.367 --> 18:49.500
- Prank him, Max!

18:49.600 --> 18:51.167
Prank sad Tad Bradford

18:51.267 --> 18:54.400
back to the storage unit
he calls home!

18:54.500 --> 18:57.133
- You've never been
more beautiful to me.

18:57.233 --> 18:58.867
Activate prank mode.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.533
- Step only where I step.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.067
- BRADFORD: I'm coming in.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.267
Ahhhhhh!

19:11.367 --> 19:14.600
Ah!

19:14.700 --> 19:18.167
- Bradford,
what a pleasant surprise.

19:18.267 --> 19:20.100
Sorry, but Wolfgang isn't here.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.500
- I know you're hiding him.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.967
I'm officially
using the authority

19:24.067 --> 19:27.300
of the order of principals
to search this house.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
- Not sure that's a thing,
but help herself.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.867
- Well, okay--oooh.

19:33.967 --> 19:34.933
- Sorry about that,

19:35.067 --> 19:37.233
my brother Billy's
quite the prankster.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.367
Great,

19:38.467 --> 19:39.600
another Thunderman
to look forward to.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.733
Ahh!

19:48.733 --> 19:49.833
- That should get him
out of here.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.500
Ah-ha!

19:54.600 --> 19:56.067
Unless he finds my lair.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.333
- A secret passage.

19:57.433 --> 19:58.633
.

19:58.733 --> 20:01.900
Ugh, smells like
Hansel and Sweat-el down there.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.400
Ah!

20:07.933 --> 20:10.533
Uh.

20:10.633 --> 20:12.867
- I already told you
he's not down here.

20:12.967 --> 20:15.467
- Then explain
those German sausages.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.900
- My dad's
a cured meat enthusiast.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.200
- Well, I believe that.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.933
All right, I guess
Wolfgang isn't here.

20:27.033 --> 20:27.900
Achoo.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.700
- Gesundheit.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.433
- There you are, filth mouth.

20:31.533 --> 20:33.133
- No, you don't!

20:33.233 --> 20:34.267
- Oh, no.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.367
Oh, ah!

20:39.867 --> 20:41.633
- Those weenies won't hold him
for long, run!

20:46.500 --> 20:48.900
- We can hide Wolfgang
at my house.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.000
- My squeezy mustard!

20:53.100 --> 20:54.133
Nein!

20:54.233 --> 20:55.700
- Gotcha!

20:55.800 --> 20:57.167
Now pull me out of this thing.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.333
- Bradford,
you can't expel Wolfgang.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.667
I'm not expelling him.

21:02.767 --> 21:05.333
- He really likes it here
and

21:05.433 --> 21:06.500
- That's right.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.467
While filing
his expulsion papers,

21:08.567 --> 21:11.233
I learned the school
gets $4,000 a month

21:11.333 --> 21:13.333
for every exchange student
enrolled.

21:15.267 --> 21:18.433
- That's right.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.767
This little ray
of German sunshine is my ticket

21:20.867 --> 21:23.167
to a bigger storage locker.

21:23.267 --> 21:25.500
I mean apartment.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.633
- ALL: Wolfgang!

21:27.733 --> 21:30.400
- Come on, kid,
tell me about your host family.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.600
They, uh--they got
an extra room?

21:36.167 --> 21:37.733
- Well, that was close.

21:37.833 --> 21:41.667
Come on, I owe you
a real anniversary dinner.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.633
- So, uh, what did you think
of my prank down there?

21:44.733 --> 21:46.767
- Well, it wasn't
so much a prank

21:46.867 --> 21:48.733
as it was
flinging meat at a guy,

21:48.833 --> 21:53.100
but, hey, not everyone's
a born prankster like me.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.533
- I guess you're right.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.900
- *

22:11.100 --> 22:16.767
- *
