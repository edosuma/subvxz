WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.572
Previously on Prison Break...
The strikes are getting closer.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.874
We got a day, maybe two, tops,

00:06.907 --> 00:10.044
to get out of this hole.
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.680
Michael's reaching out to us.
We got to get help.
A woman named Sheba.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.349
Your brother speaks
in riddles, does he?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.418
ISIL. We're gonna get stopped.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.719
Why don't we forget
each other ever existed.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.555
Beauty's not so
easily forgotten.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.024
Friends in high
places, Bagwell.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.694
WHITCOMBE:
I can equip you with a fully
articulate prosthetic.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.229
Who's behind this?
Nobody.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.864
This is Kaniel Outis.
SARA: Okay, but you
and I both know

00:30.898 --> 00:33.033
who Michael Scofield was.
LINCOLN: We've awoken something,

00:33.067 --> 00:34.735
something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.004
Jacob?
(groans)

00:37.037 --> 00:38.106
JACOB:
That's game theory.
You meet people.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.208
You bring them into your life

00:40.241 --> 00:41.375
until the moment

00:41.409 --> 00:42.543
you need to manipulate
the relationship

00:42.576 --> 00:43.611
to your advantage.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.845
You agreed to help him... how?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.514
If I could arrange a blackout.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.216
He knew someone
who could get him out.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.284
Someone found my father.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.019
It means the escape is on.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.687
TV REPORTER: ISIL forces
are also bent

00:53.721 --> 00:55.289
on freeing their leader
Abu Ramal,

00:55.323 --> 00:57.625
known for his extreme views
and practices.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.262
(speaking Arabic)

01:06.667 --> 01:09.470
(indistinct shouting)

01:35.028 --> 01:37.097
*

01:43.204 --> 01:45.173
(children playing nearby)

01:50.144 --> 01:53.514
(speaking Arabic)

02:18.406 --> 02:20.574
*

02:41.929 --> 02:43.931
(speaking in Arabic)

02:47.568 --> 02:49.703
He says Bubble Gum Man sent him.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.640
Someone in the prison
he hasn't met,

02:52.673 --> 02:56.510
but gives him gum
in exchange for errands.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.046
He says he's frightened.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.848
Tell him it's all right.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.717
Ask him if he does Tic Tacs.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.219
He can have the whole lot

03:05.253 --> 03:07.821
if he keeps the
messages coming.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.424
Thank you, Tic Tac Man.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.827
(children laughing nearby)

03:13.861 --> 03:17.365
(in unison): Tic Tac,
Tic Tac, Tic Tacs.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.032
It's a passage from the Suras.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.901
"And Yusef said to the prisoner:

03:20.934 --> 03:23.003
'Remember me in the
presence of your lord.'

03:23.036 --> 03:24.672
"But Satan made him forget,

03:24.705 --> 03:26.340
"and Yusef stayed in prison

03:26.374 --> 03:28.409
for several years."

03:28.442 --> 03:30.177
The calligraphy is unusual,

03:30.210 --> 03:33.881
the spacing, the
way it's shaped,

03:33.914 --> 03:36.850
like-like spokes
on a wheel.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.118
Like the center of Sana'a.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.691
You think his brother
sent us a map?

03:43.724 --> 03:45.793
LINCOLN:
There's a red dot

03:45.826 --> 03:48.596
dotting the "I",

03:48.629 --> 03:50.564
and whatever this is here.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.132
He's trying to
give us a location.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.467
A location for what?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.235
The only thing
I can think of

03:55.269 --> 03:56.637
is where we're supposed
to meet him

03:56.670 --> 03:58.205
when the escape
goes down tonight.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.807
(explosion in distance)

03:59.840 --> 04:01.642
(sighs)

04:01.675 --> 04:03.143
Your brother is
your business now.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.746
I have to get my family
on a flight tonight

04:05.779 --> 04:07.315
before the
airport shuts down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.049
Hold up.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.584
We need tickets, too,
three of them.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.420
One for me, one for Michael,
one for C.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.388
If I'm getting anybody any
tickets it's these kids,

04:14.422 --> 04:15.956
not your mercenary brother.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.958
And how are you going
to do that without any money?

04:21.695 --> 04:22.996
You're holding
these kids' freedom

04:23.030 --> 04:24.432
over my head;
is that it?

04:24.465 --> 04:27.735
LINCOLN:
Sheba, you get me
those plane tickets,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.803
and I'll pay for every
single one of these kids

04:29.837 --> 04:32.272
to get out of this country.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.942
Something tells me that's
what you want to do anyhow.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.176
Careful.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.713
You're accusing me
of having a heart.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.695
(indistinct shouting)

04:54.728 --> 04:56.296
Out of my way.
Get out of my way.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.265
Hmm? Huh?
What, you want to go?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.468
Hey.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.370
Keep it together.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.672
You got to have it together
to keep it together.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.641
(explosion)

05:07.675 --> 05:10.444
One of those hits us now,

05:10.478 --> 05:12.646
after all this time,
I swear to God...
Nine hours.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.115
Nine hours till we get
out, you understand?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.684
It's 1:00 a.m.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.318
We get through today
and we're on the bricks.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.787
And then what?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.889
It was four years ago.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.358
All of our plans,
the passports, the shop,

05:24.392 --> 05:27.495
everything is probably
under rubble by now.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.229
I got someone on it.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.400
What, the kid
you throw planes to?

05:32.433 --> 05:33.701
(explosion)

05:35.068 --> 05:36.837
No.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.406
I'm talking about the only
person I trust in the world

05:38.439 --> 05:41.341
as much as I trust you.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.879
C-NOTE:
So, this is it,
the spot on the map.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.247
The owner says
he sold the auto shop

05:47.280 --> 05:48.749
to an American
four years ago

05:48.782 --> 05:51.218
and hasn't
seen him since.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.456
(indistinct shouting)

06:05.232 --> 06:09.102
You know that American
was Michael, right?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.939
LINCOLN:
Question is what was
he using this place for.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.208
C-NOTE:
Planning his escape.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.682
It looks like his original
exfil point

06:21.715 --> 06:23.350
was at the northern border.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.585
SHEBA:
Won't be doing that now.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.788
It's ISIL territory.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.427
C-NOTE:
Mock-ups, passport photos,

06:33.461 --> 06:35.763
disguises.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.433
But it looks like he just wasn't
planning on getting himself out.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.502
He was getting Abu Ramal out.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.639
This guy's the enemy

06:45.673 --> 06:48.075
of everything that's
civilized, Linc.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.612
That brings me to
my real question.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.880
Who in the hell are
we breaking out?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.115
Is it Michael Scofield

06:55.148 --> 06:57.518
or Kaniel Outis?

07:03.991 --> 07:05.993
*

07:35.989 --> 07:37.991
(gunfire in distance)

07:43.864 --> 07:45.599
What the hell's going on?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.835
Ramal's men are gonna
institute Sharia law.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.370
And that son of a bitch himself
is gonna enjoy the show.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.506
WHIP: We just have to keep our
heads down and get through this

07:52.540 --> 07:54.241
so we can get out tonight.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.720
SID:
No. No, don't let them take me!

08:06.754 --> 08:08.421
No!
(Abu Ramal speaks Arabic)

08:31.378 --> 08:33.513
Sorry.
No!

08:40.754 --> 08:42.322
Ramal!

08:42.355 --> 08:45.125
(grunting, groaning)

08:46.359 --> 08:49.496
You bastards!
Let him go!

08:49.529 --> 08:51.331
Ramal!

08:51.364 --> 08:52.900
(groaning)

08:52.933 --> 08:53.934
(quietly):
What are you doing?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.102
Stay out of this.
No.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.604
The escape is tonight.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.172
If you want to get out,
you need me and you need him.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.608
ABU RAMAL:
Get to the point.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.644
Let him go, Ramal.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.947
(grunting)

09:10.250 --> 09:11.251
Then I'll do it.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.086
Do not touch him.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.421
Get back, dog!

09:14.454 --> 09:17.057
(indistinct yelling)

09:19.226 --> 09:22.329
There will be no killing
in this prison. Understand?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.541
A&W: He's tried
to contact her before.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.377
VAN GOGH:
Only difference is
he succeeded this time.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.180
It's smart...
going through the boy.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.785
Ask a question?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.155
Why are we pulling
our punches with this woman?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.660
I got sent to her house
a couple of days ago,

09:52.693 --> 09:54.594
started spilling blood,
but I'm just supposed to stop

09:54.628 --> 09:57.898
before I start spilling hers.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.399
How's that work?

09:59.432 --> 10:03.170
You'll get used
to Poseidon's game.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.805
It's all chess.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.207
It's a performance.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.748
A performance designed to
make Outis reach out to her.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.784
Now all we got to do
is listen in,

10:16.817 --> 10:19.286
find out what his plans are.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.421
And she doesn't know it,

10:21.454 --> 10:25.425
but she's the one that's
going to lead us to him.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.661
They said I can
go in the morning.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.629
Your femoral artery
was severed.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.199
That's not something you usually
just get up and walk away from.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.534
Hey, they gave me the okay.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.369
They're the doctors
on this one, not you.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.472
And I'm going full mental
in here, so I'm gonna go.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.274
Okay. How about this?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.643
When you are discharged,

10:43.677 --> 10:46.179
why don't we go up to your
parents' lake house?

10:46.213 --> 10:48.949
I'll just pick you up
with Mike and we'll go.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.550
Mmm.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.353
You don't want to be
in the house, do you?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.188
Somebody comes into your house

10:55.222 --> 10:56.857
and shoots up your husband
and they're still out there.

10:56.890 --> 11:00.227
No.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.895
(chuckles)
What?

11:01.929 --> 11:03.897
No, it's just something
you do with your nose

11:03.931 --> 11:05.132
when you're determined.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.633
With my nose?
It's subtle.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.668
I mean, it's really subtle.
Better be.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.705
The face is amazing.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.540
I mean,

11:13.573 --> 11:17.745
the tiniest detail,
less than a millimeter,

11:17.778 --> 11:19.646
differentiates
everything.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.649
An emotion on one
person can be...

11:22.682 --> 11:25.385
so troubled

11:25.418 --> 11:27.054
and on another...

11:29.056 --> 11:31.058
...so beautiful.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.527
You're not trying to get
somewhere, are you, Mr. Ness?

11:34.561 --> 11:36.396
Yes, actually,

11:36.429 --> 11:37.664
I am.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.900
(chuckles)

11:53.747 --> 11:56.683
T-BAG:
Hello there.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.952
I come as a compatriot, Sara.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.254
Get out of my way
or I'll scream.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.824
Last thing I want.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.765
For your information,

12:11.799 --> 12:13.934
I know about Kaniel Outis.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.473
Tell me what you know.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.742
The day I hit the bricks
from Fox River,

12:22.776 --> 12:24.411
someone named Outis,

12:24.444 --> 12:26.246
out of the goodness
of their soul,

12:26.279 --> 12:29.049
unsolicited, pays
for this modern prosthesis.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.884
(T-Bag makes squeaking noises)

12:30.918 --> 12:32.319
What's that? (squeaks)

12:32.352 --> 12:34.922
A million bucks?
Why would anyone

12:34.955 --> 12:36.623
come out of a pocket
for a wretch like me,

12:36.656 --> 12:38.892
a penny, much less
a million bucks?

12:38.926 --> 12:42.729
Yeah, if you're coming to me
for answers, I don't have any.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.332
Oh, I went looking for answers,
Doc Sara.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.667
I looked up Outis
on the Interwebs.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.170
Whose face comes up
but your dead ex-husband's,

12:50.203 --> 12:51.404
looking very much alive.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
Lazarus arisen
from the dead.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.109
He's drawing us into something,
isn't he?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.646
He wants something, doesn't he?

12:59.679 --> 13:03.150
Come near me or my family again,
I will kill you.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.185
Better to have me on your side,
Sara.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.354
We can figure this out together.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.490
(exhales)

13:16.329 --> 13:17.764
ZAKAT:
We have all heard the war

13:17.797 --> 13:20.167
outside.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.203
But even if it is just
within these walls,

13:23.236 --> 13:27.274
the law of the land
is still in place.

13:27.307 --> 13:31.211
The law of God supersedes
the law of this corrupt land.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.714
We will not be reduced
to animals.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.853
MAN (whispering):
Amazing you still trust him.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.389
He will use you for the
escape and he will leave you.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.158
(quietly):
No one's escaping.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.894
Who are you?
(coughs)

13:46.927 --> 13:48.395
A man who knows
your friend there

13:48.428 --> 13:49.897
more than anyone in this prison.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.965
I was in solitary with him

13:51.999 --> 13:53.200
for years.
Yeah, so was I.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.367
But not in the cell
across from him.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.871
He told me about the escape.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.240
We have to work together.
No.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.910
Tried to convince me
to go with him,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.878
just the two of us.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.713
But I told him no.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.882
I would not leave my brother.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.717
That is the
Army in me,

14:10.750 --> 14:13.253
the Christian in me.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.521
He is an opportunist.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.990
He will use whoever he needs.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.692
He has told you something about
the escape. I know he has.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.428
You were in the cell with him.
You.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.431
You tell me, so I can help you,

14:24.464 --> 14:28.235
before he uses you
to get that devil out

14:28.268 --> 14:31.871
and we are all
left here to die.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.748
(indistinct shouting)

14:43.816 --> 14:46.053
(automatic gunfire)

14:46.086 --> 14:48.355
SHEBA: We need passports, Omar.
You think you can help us?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.124
LINCOLN: Hold on.
We're gonna trust this guy?

14:51.158 --> 14:52.225
He's the one who stole
my passport in the first place.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.861
It was honest bargaining,
friend.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.696
I took nothing.
Besides,

14:56.729 --> 14:59.199
your passport is long gone,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.801
somewhere far overseas
by now, I bet.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.405
If you want, um, I can have
the forgers make you another.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.907
My own fake passport
coming from you?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.909
You have another option?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.244
(distant explosion)
(rattling)

15:11.278 --> 15:13.446
Quick. I'm
leaving the city.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.316
Nowhere is safe anymore.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.385
I need two passports.
One for me,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.254
one for my brother,
Michael Scofield.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.559
$1,000 U.S. each, deposit.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.895
$1,000 U.S.
when you pick them up.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.498
C?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.169
You screw with me
and I'll kill you.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.737
I screw you,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.273
I won't be around
for you to kill me.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.309
11:00 tonight,
Sheba.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.111
Passports
will be ready.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.280
That means we're gonna
have to split up.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.349
You two get
the passports,

15:49.382 --> 15:51.118
and I'll go with our friend here
to the power plant

15:51.151 --> 15:53.586
and kill the lights.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.290
And we get Michael out.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.426
REPORTER: A U.S. State
Department spokesperson said

15:59.459 --> 16:00.660
the capital of Yemen

16:00.693 --> 16:01.961
grows ever closer to collapse

16:01.995 --> 16:03.763
and it's only a matter of time

16:03.796 --> 16:06.866
until Sana'a's fallen
to the hands of ISIL radicals,

16:06.899 --> 16:10.003
with the total collapse
coming as soon as tomorrow.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.975
SARA: Hey.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.810
Looking
for a smartphone?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.546
Yeah. You, um...

16:19.579 --> 16:21.814
you fix phones, too, right?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.183
Yeah.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.253
I think somebody
hacked my cell.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.959
Whoa.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.428
Is there any chance
you can help me figure out who?

16:37.030 --> 16:39.432
(distant explosions)

16:41.168 --> 16:42.502
(indistinct chatter)

16:53.546 --> 16:55.048
WHIP:
That Christian guy said

16:55.082 --> 16:57.550
you told him you'd just
take him. No one else.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.386
He's a liar.
You don't want anything

16:59.419 --> 17:02.255
to do with him.
I don't know.
Christian, Army.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.191
Seems pretty up front to me.
Did he happen to tell you

17:04.223 --> 17:05.825
about some of the arrests
he and his brother made

17:05.858 --> 17:08.428
at their security checkpoint?
No, focused on you.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.262
They had a specialty: women.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.332
Body parts strewn
around Yemen.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.766
That's why they're here.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.702
Wearing a cross
is one thing.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.338
Living by it is another.
All right, okay, sure.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.672
Just promise me
I can trust you,

17:19.705 --> 17:21.907
that we're still
doing this tonight.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.344
(distant booming)
MICHAEL:
All these years

17:24.377 --> 17:26.113
we've been working together,

17:26.146 --> 17:28.047
you've been able
to trust me the whole time.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.749
Last four years in the hole,
sitting in the dark,

17:29.782 --> 17:31.418
I couldn't even hear
a voice. I don't know.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.919
Maybe something's
changed or...

17:32.952 --> 17:35.588
Nothing's changed.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.358
Poseidon put us in here
to get Ramal out,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.693
but then he abandoned us.
Ramal is Poseidon's guy,

17:40.727 --> 17:44.264
not ours. He's an animal.
I suggest

17:44.297 --> 17:47.600
you watch your mouth. Some
of these guys speak English.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.069
WHIP: Why are
we still getting him out?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.739
We're telling him we're getting
him out. There's a difference.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.441
We got to act like we're

17:54.474 --> 17:56.075
on his side until
the moment we're not.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.410
But what if you're acting
like you're on my side

17:57.444 --> 17:58.478
till the moment
you're not?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.113
You are getting paranoid.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.581
Yeah, well, four years in
the box is gonna do that to you.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.550
I'm not leaving you behind.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.718
You're my whip hand.
I don't know that.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.488
How do I know
I'm your whip hand?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.757
You'll understand later.
I want to understand now.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.925
Okay?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.563
Get your hands off me.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.965
Answers, now. I'm serious.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.567
Okay.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.601
(grunts)

18:21.634 --> 18:22.935
I said don't touch me!

18:22.969 --> 18:24.070
(indistinct chatter, chuckling)

18:24.103 --> 18:25.472
WHIP:
Okay. Mm.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.974
Mm. Okay, that's fair.

18:28.007 --> 18:31.077
(grunting)
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.513
You want the hole again, huh?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.548
MICHAEL:
No, we're good.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.417
No.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.418
We're good.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.820
We're far from good.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.791
(indistinct chatter)

18:53.233 --> 18:57.103
By tomorrow, we won't
have to worry about him.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.905
(speaks inaudibly)

19:07.747 --> 19:10.049
SHEBA:
Keep your head down.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.484
Don't make eye contact
with anybody.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.053
A lot of ISIL sympathizers
everywhere.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.289
We get our passports,
we're out of here.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.990
Understand?

19:18.024 --> 19:20.427
(indistinct chatter)

19:34.173 --> 19:37.043
Planning on leaving?

19:37.076 --> 19:40.079
Right when the glorious
revolution is beginning.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.416
I'm not here for political
discussion, just passports.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.754
Money first.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.223
Passports first.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.362
(sighs)

20:01.133 --> 20:03.069
LINCOLN:
They're empty.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.838
(screams, grunting)

20:05.872 --> 20:08.475
Sheba!
(grunting)

20:17.049 --> 20:19.051
(indistinct shouting)

20:24.257 --> 20:26.726
(keys jangle, lock clicks)

20:27.927 --> 20:29.729
I'm sorry I hit you.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.931
I can explain.
SID: Can you explain why

20:31.964 --> 20:33.700
you were going to let that man
kill me?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.735
I wouldn't have let him
kill you.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.937
You sure seem to be chums
with the head of ISIL, friend.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.207
Didn't know you participated
in these conversations, Ja.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.909
Only when they're interesting.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.044
And they're usually not.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.246
There are people
in my government,

20:47.280 --> 20:48.948
believe it or not,
who want that man out

20:48.981 --> 20:52.319
for their own convoluted
foreign policy over here.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.887
That's the job Whip and I
were sent here to do.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.122
But for some reason,

20:56.155 --> 20:57.957
we were betrayed.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.727
Which means we're getting out
without Ramal.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.062
And every one of you
is crucial to that plan.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.564
How?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.299
Your whole escape's
already wired.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.568
Lights out,
you're over the wall.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.903
What do you need a Korean junkie

21:10.937 --> 21:13.573
like me for?
Korean genius, you mean.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.309
Getting over that wall
is just the start.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.144
Once that happens,

21:18.177 --> 21:20.146
there are things
only you can do.

21:20.179 --> 21:23.616
Back on point: you hit me.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.285
You wanted proof that I sided
with you and not Ramal.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.455
And splitting my lip
does that how?
MUSTAPHA: Son of a bitch

21:28.488 --> 21:31.991
Kaniel Outis keeps
playing, doesn't he?

21:40.333 --> 21:41.968
Where is my watch?

21:42.001 --> 21:43.636
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.105
Hmm. You don't?

21:46.138 --> 21:47.607
I'm going to

21:47.640 --> 21:50.643
break you in half when I find
that watch, you know?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.315
Toss the cell.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.155
(man coughing,
indistinct chatter)

22:03.189 --> 22:05.224
(metallic clinking, rolling)

22:23.610 --> 22:25.745
It's not here.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.484
Order a lockdown
of the whole prison.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.053
No one gets out of their cells

22:34.086 --> 22:35.488
until that watch is found!

22:35.522 --> 22:36.889
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

22:48.300 --> 22:50.737
I told you, Ramal's not going
anywhere. Only we are.

22:50.770 --> 22:54.106
We're gonna be locked in our box
just like the rest of them,

22:54.140 --> 22:55.908
only our box has a way out.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.077
And in two hours
when those lights go black,

22:58.110 --> 23:00.447
we're gonna disappear
from this place like ghosts.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.683
Yeah, all right.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.018
(coughs)

23:06.052 --> 23:07.286
(sighs)

23:20.266 --> 23:21.734
(groans)

23:21.768 --> 23:24.904
(panting)

23:26.172 --> 23:27.574
(yelling)

23:27.607 --> 23:29.108
Sheba!

23:29.141 --> 23:30.309
(grunting)

23:30.342 --> 23:32.845
CYCLOPS:
Who are these men
you work with?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.585
They're beneath you.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.419
You're beneath me.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.291
(grunts)
(gasps)

23:45.324 --> 23:47.960
It pains me to hurt you,

23:47.994 --> 23:52.632
but a good woman
is a humble woman.

23:52.665 --> 23:56.803
Remember that.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.405
Who are these men?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.273
Doesn't matter.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.942
They're leaving.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.778
I am not the bad guy here.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.247
You and I have a history.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.949
How I doted

24:09.982 --> 24:13.920
on you in grade school,
how I waited and I waited.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.088
You did not wait.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.657
You tried to rape me!

24:17.690 --> 24:20.259
(yells)
(yells)

24:20.292 --> 24:22.662
(panting)

24:22.695 --> 24:24.697
Please.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.332
(panting)

24:26.365 --> 24:29.101
Please. Please untie me...

24:29.135 --> 24:31.003
(panting)

24:31.037 --> 24:33.039
...so I can take your other eye.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.373
(yells)

24:36.242 --> 24:38.410
(door opens, computer beeps)

24:45.251 --> 24:47.987
Afternoon.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.522
I'm looking

24:49.556 --> 24:52.559
for a cell phone that
a woman stole from me.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.027
She looks like this.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.700
No, can't help you.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.836
Can't... or won't?

25:03.870 --> 25:06.839
Sorry. Store policy,
that's all.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.916
STORE OWNER:
Hey, what are you doing?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.818
Just... Ow!

25:18.851 --> 25:20.519
Oh!
Let's go again.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.591
Have you seen her?
(groans)

25:24.624 --> 25:26.525
(groans)
Yes. Yes!

25:26.559 --> 25:29.228
She was here, like,
ten minutes ago.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.764
Said her phone was hacked
and wanted to know who did it.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.766
And now she knows,
doesn't she?

25:37.236 --> 25:39.471
She baited us.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.715
(door squeaks open)

25:48.748 --> 25:51.217
(horns honking,
tires squealing)

25:57.590 --> 25:59.992
Dead end.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.933
(panting)

26:19.746 --> 26:21.313
(gasping)

26:34.994 --> 26:37.529
(engine revs)

26:40.266 --> 26:42.301
(sighs)

26:42.334 --> 26:43.736
A&W:
Any chance Poseidon'll just

26:43.770 --> 26:45.872
let us kill her?
It might come to that.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.883
(panting quietly)

27:00.720 --> 27:02.722
(loud shouting in Arabic,
metallic clanking)

27:09.361 --> 27:11.630
(Ja coughing loudly)

27:11.664 --> 27:12.965
We get out,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.633
where are you going?

27:14.667 --> 27:16.635
Back to my couch.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.771
My couch in Seoul.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.640
Where the walls are mine,

27:21.674 --> 27:24.476
the floors are mine,

27:24.510 --> 27:26.979
no one can get to me.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.882
The world stays outside
like it's supposed to.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.618
Calgary.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.186
Canada?

27:34.220 --> 27:37.890
I'm going to be a ski jumper.

27:37.924 --> 27:41.193
You've never seen snow,
have you?

27:41.227 --> 27:43.129
That's the point.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.732
Everything in my life
till now in this country--

27:45.765 --> 27:50.302
the heat, the hate,
the skies that never snow.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.972
You talk about the world.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.074
I want to be
on the other side of it.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.554
JACOB:
Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.056
MAN:
Hi, son. Yeah, Sara,

28:10.089 --> 28:12.558
let me, uh...
Thanks, sir.

28:12.591 --> 28:13.993
JACOB:
The house looks great.
Come on in.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.527
(phone rings)
Oh, give me one sec. Sorry.

28:15.561 --> 28:18.230
DAD:
When'd you drive up?
Hello?

28:18.264 --> 28:21.868
Hi. This is Brian at Jep's.
I got this number

28:21.901 --> 28:23.235
when I activated
your new phone.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.671
You never came back.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.506
I'm sorry. I don't think
I'm going to.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.208
Well, okay, I just want
to let you know that

28:29.241 --> 28:31.543
I figured out
who was hacking your phone.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.112
Who?

28:33.145 --> 28:35.581
You... hacked your own phone.

28:35.614 --> 28:36.916
What are you talking about?

28:36.949 --> 28:39.518
Your thumbprint is your
password, right? Well,

28:39.551 --> 28:42.688
whoever hacked your phone
used your thumbprint, so,

28:42.721 --> 28:46.058
unless you're missing a thumb,
that's you.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.626
I don't know what
you're messed up in,

28:47.659 --> 28:48.761
but I'd watch your back...
(phone beeps off)

28:50.096 --> 28:52.698
SARA:
When you were in the hospital,

28:52.731 --> 28:56.268
the woman who attacked us
came back with her partner.
What?

28:56.302 --> 28:58.237
They tracked me down
using my cell phone,

28:58.270 --> 29:00.306
so I brought it to Jep's
to try and figure out

29:00.339 --> 29:02.809
who they were working for.
Whoa, wait. Sara,
this has police

29:02.842 --> 29:04.811
written all over it.
Police haven't been able
to do a thing.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.412
So, what? You went
to Jep's Electronics

29:06.445 --> 29:08.247
in some hackneyed attempt
at counter-espionage?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.951
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

29:11.984 --> 29:13.953
I get you don't
know where to turn,

29:13.986 --> 29:15.621
but I got a stake
in this, too.

29:15.654 --> 29:18.424
Mm-hmm.
Okay? This is
my wife, my son.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.726
You want to get
back at these guys?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.495
The university. I mean,
it has real resources,

29:23.529 --> 29:25.264
their computer
sciences department.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.066
The phone's done.
It's gonna stay at Jep's.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.170
So that's your plan-- just
bury your head in the sand?

29:33.339 --> 29:35.607
No.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.143
No, I've learned over the years

29:37.176 --> 29:39.611
that's exactly
what you don't do. Thank you.

29:42.849 --> 29:45.284
(phone ringing)

29:51.390 --> 29:52.992
Which one's this?

29:53.025 --> 29:55.527
The one you accosted
in a bathroom.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.364
(laughing) Oh, that wasn't
accostment, honey.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.432
I've learned some things

30:00.466 --> 30:04.170
about who it is we're apparently
both looking for?

30:04.203 --> 30:06.973
But I need to know that you're
willing to go the distance.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.308
I'm made of the distance,
honeysuckle.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.543
I am the distance.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.812
Good. Because you're gonna have
a conversation

30:13.846 --> 30:15.347
with Paul Kellerman for me.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.950
Bull. Kellerman's behind this?

30:17.984 --> 30:19.952
And you are gonna get
every shred of information

30:19.986 --> 30:22.388
you can about
what's really going on.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.960
15 minutes.
(loud, distant shouting)

30:27.994 --> 30:31.730
I'm soiling myself here,
just so you know.

30:31.763 --> 30:34.233
(sighs)

30:37.703 --> 30:42.008
Look, I'm just gonna
say one thing, okay?

30:42.041 --> 30:44.343
You're like a brother to me,

30:44.376 --> 30:46.145
like an older brother.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.881
I'm not much of a brother.
Sure.

30:48.915 --> 30:52.151
Point is I had zero, nobody,
till you recruited me.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.187
When you pulled me out of that
prison in the Ozarks, you had

30:55.221 --> 30:57.689
integrity.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.028
I know we were doing
CIA work, sure,

31:02.061 --> 31:03.762
you know,
pulling their people out, but

31:03.795 --> 31:06.565
it was about you and me,

31:06.598 --> 31:08.067
and having each
other's back.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.903
And it didn't matter if you
were Ramon Cadena when we did

31:10.937 --> 31:13.539
the Colombian break,
or, you know Asaf...

31:13.572 --> 31:15.942
(snaps his fingers)
What was his name?

31:15.975 --> 31:18.277
Whatever. The one in Egypt.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.246
You were still you.

31:20.279 --> 31:24.750
And it's the same
with this one.

31:24.783 --> 31:27.253
You know, we trump you
up as Kaniel Outis,

31:27.286 --> 31:28.887
big international
terrorist.

31:28.921 --> 31:32.858
It's just a name,

31:32.891 --> 31:36.728
it's just a rap sheet,
it's a way to get you locked up.

31:36.762 --> 31:37.997
Right?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.868
I guess what I'm
asking you is did...

31:42.901 --> 31:46.438
did something happen to you
while you were in solitary?

31:48.507 --> 31:50.576
Did you become
Kaniel Outis

31:50.609 --> 31:53.645
in there in your head?

31:53.679 --> 31:57.083
Do you now want Ramal out
after all?

31:57.116 --> 32:00.652
I already told you Ramal
is out of the picture.

32:00.686 --> 32:03.122
Yeah, you said that,
but one small thing...

32:03.155 --> 32:06.458
We go up through that hole,

32:06.492 --> 32:08.060
and then we skirt
above the block.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.630
Goes right above Ramal's
cell, doesn't it?

32:11.663 --> 32:13.899
Knock out a couple tiles,

32:13.932 --> 32:17.103
he joins the escape,
doesn't he?

32:20.672 --> 32:22.274
What did you
whisper to him

32:22.308 --> 32:24.676
in that moment
after the fight?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.480
You whispered something,
what was it?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.952
Nine minutes.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.587
How do you know?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.656
He told me at dinner.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.858
He said he would
come for us.

32:39.891 --> 32:43.362
It's supposed to be only me,

32:43.395 --> 32:46.198
but you will all be coming.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.302
MAN:
Open block five.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.704
(man speaking in Arabic)

32:52.738 --> 32:54.306
Everyone out.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.674
Shakedown.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.289
Got it.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.225
Found it, Mustapha.
It was in the emir's coat here.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.561
(Cross laughing)

33:15.594 --> 33:17.363
You trusted the liar,
didn't you?

33:17.396 --> 33:20.566
(continues laughing)

33:23.001 --> 33:26.305
MICHAEL:
Now we just pray
they get the lights out.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.340
C-NOTE:
We got to hurry, man.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.541
We got less than ten minutes

33:29.575 --> 33:31.343
to kill the power.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.345
Don't worry.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.014
With luck,
both your friend and my son

33:36.048 --> 33:37.716
will be free
within the hour.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.585
(electricity powers down)

33:39.618 --> 33:42.354
Okay, breakers are down.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.989
Now we just need
to pull the redundancies.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.524
They're down the hall.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.359
I'll stay here and deal
with security. Go.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.697
Okay.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.832
Come on, where are you?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.167
Ah.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.403
(grunts)

33:57.436 --> 33:59.037
Oh, come on.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.474
Oh, when in doubt,
go old school.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.648
(grunting, electricity crackles)

34:15.053 --> 34:17.422
(men yelling in Arabic)

34:17.456 --> 34:19.891
Let's go.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.263
Get the generators up.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.630
Get these inmates
back inside!

34:25.664 --> 34:26.764
Now!
(grunting)

34:26.797 --> 34:28.600
(yelling and clattering)

34:35.072 --> 34:36.308
Let's go, let's go!

34:37.643 --> 34:39.311
The weapons,
get their weapons.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.722
They are trying to
escape without us.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.391
Get to their cell.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.726
Block six.
Come on!

34:54.760 --> 34:58.029
(Abu Ramal calls out in Arabic)

35:01.467 --> 35:03.969
You heard them, brother.

35:04.002 --> 35:05.304
Block six.
Yes.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.072
(whispering):
Ja, give me your phone.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.774
Come on.

35:11.042 --> 35:14.079
(grunts)

35:14.112 --> 35:15.814
Mount flashlights.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.115
Secure every room.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.784
Shoot only if you have to.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.786
And if you do, shoot to kill.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.854
(men yelling in Arabic)

35:28.460 --> 35:30.162
(guard groans, Cross grunts)

35:31.397 --> 35:33.699
(grunting)

35:42.541 --> 35:44.710
This way.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.945
A shortcut to block six,
brother, come on!

35:46.978 --> 35:49.315
SHEBA:
Get off me, you sick bastard!

35:49.348 --> 35:51.217
It's easier if
you don't struggle.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.718
(grunting)

35:56.855 --> 35:58.190
(grunts)

35:58.224 --> 36:00.659
(Sheba screams in the distance)

36:02.027 --> 36:03.595
(grunting)

36:07.032 --> 36:09.034
(Sheba screams)

36:11.403 --> 36:12.738
(grunting)

36:18.777 --> 36:21.413
(grunts)
This is how you treat me?

36:21.447 --> 36:23.582
You're going to die now, dog.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.918
(Lincoln groans)

36:26.952 --> 36:29.721
(Lincoln grunts)

36:29.755 --> 36:31.690
(both grunting)

36:40.799 --> 36:44.336
Sheba, Sheba,
it's me, it's me.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.405
Are you okay?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.881
(indistinct conversations)

36:55.914 --> 36:57.549
(phone rings)

36:57.583 --> 36:58.784
Linc, talk to me.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.019
Get to the rendezvous,
the auto shop.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.220
We ain't gonna make it.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.622
Sheba's busted up real bad.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.223
What happened?
Just get to the rendezvous.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.926
We got to be there
for Michael, damn it!

37:10.061 --> 37:12.964
JA:
Damn. Lockdown.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.966
Extra guards
on the roof.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.969
Question is whether
they move on.

37:18.003 --> 37:21.039
(men yelling)
Quickly! Hurry, hurry!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.774
It's here, this one!

37:22.808 --> 37:25.377
(whispering):
We got problems.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.647
Guys are trying
to get into the cell.
Problem.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.148
What's wrong?
People coming.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.417
Damn it, we got
guards up here.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.618
Try and buy us
some time.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.820
WHIP:
I'm taking care of it.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.455
(grunting)

37:37.623 --> 37:38.757
No, they're
escaping, hurry!

37:38.790 --> 37:40.492
(groans)

37:40.526 --> 37:41.793
(grunts)

37:41.827 --> 37:43.595
Ah!

37:43.629 --> 37:46.264
No, please!
Don't leave us.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.833
Please, we are Christians,

37:47.866 --> 37:49.435
they will kill us!
Please!

37:49.468 --> 37:51.002
SID: No, we're still not
clear up top.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.237
Make sure
they don't get up.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.839
Go!

37:53.872 --> 37:55.273
MICHAEL:
They're coming, Ja.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.242
How we doing?
Not good.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.311
Guards are even closer.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.980
Pull yourself up!

38:02.013 --> 38:03.248
(groans and pants)

38:03.281 --> 38:04.650
(grunting)

38:06.818 --> 38:08.320
SID:
Help, help!

38:09.355 --> 38:10.922
Sid!

38:10.956 --> 38:13.325
(grunting continues)

38:13.359 --> 38:14.926
(Sid yells)

38:14.960 --> 38:16.828
Sid!

38:18.530 --> 38:20.332
Help me out!

38:20.366 --> 38:21.700
Get him up here first.

38:21.733 --> 38:22.868
CROSS:
That's not how this works.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.703
You pull my brother
up first.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.772
Hurry, Ramal is coming.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.007
CROSS'S BROTHER: Lend me your
hand. I swear I'm gonna...

38:29.040 --> 38:31.209
The kid comes up first!

38:31.242 --> 38:33.545
(Cross's brother groans,
Cross yells)

38:33.579 --> 38:35.313
Step away, step away.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.549
No! Mosa, Mosa, look at me!

38:37.583 --> 38:39.485
Mosa! Mosa!

38:39.518 --> 38:41.487
No! No, look at me,
brother.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.023
WHIP:
Go, go, go! It's Ramal.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.492
CROSS:
Look at me! Mosa!

38:53.432 --> 38:55.634
MICHAEL: Hurry. We've got a
minute tops to get out of here.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.902
Get up there,
after him.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.537
Drop them!
(gun hammers click,
Cross crying)

38:58.570 --> 39:00.972
Drop them!

39:01.006 --> 39:02.508
Put it down!

39:08.414 --> 39:10.582
Do it!

39:12.684 --> 39:15.120
CROSS (crying):
No!
Down, now!

39:17.022 --> 39:18.924
Board spans the gap.
WHIP:
Blanket covers the wire.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.759
Get out!
(guard yells in Arabic)

39:26.398 --> 39:27.966
What are you doing
in this cell?

39:31.470 --> 39:33.204
ZAKAT (echoing):
They're on the roof!

39:33.238 --> 39:36.041
(radio buzzes,
indistinct transmission)

39:36.074 --> 39:37.943
(indistinct radio chatter,
guns cock)

39:37.976 --> 39:40.946
(guards yelling in Arabic)

39:43.949 --> 39:45.451
Don't shoot!

39:52.458 --> 39:55.761
*

40:26.825 --> 40:28.827
*

40:40.472 --> 40:43.742
(indistinct talking in Arabic)

40:43.775 --> 40:45.143
ABU RAMAL:
I trusted you, Kaniel Outis.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.112
And you lied to me.

40:47.145 --> 40:50.816
By God and my armies
of the caliphate,

40:50.849 --> 40:52.350
you will die for it.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.486
Maybe even tomorrow.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.353
*

41:39.698 --> 41:41.667
Sara...

41:43.702 --> 41:46.638
I'm putting you in danger
by saying this,

41:46.672 --> 41:50.141
but maybe it doesn't matter
because I'll be dead,

41:50.175 --> 41:52.177
and they'll leave you alone.

41:55.113 --> 41:58.984
But I love you.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.353
You'll see I loved you.

42:02.387 --> 42:03.922
I never stopped loving you.

42:06.625 --> 42:10.428
This whole lie, it was for you.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.364
Sara, if I...

42:13.398 --> 42:16.534
if I do die,

42:16.568 --> 42:19.671
don't let them put Kaniel Outis
on the headstone,

42:19.705 --> 42:23.274
because that's never who I was.

42:25.443 --> 42:28.279
Make them put my real name--

42:28.313 --> 42:30.548
the man I have always been--

42:34.920 --> 42:37.222
(phone beeps)
Michael Scofield.

42:41.326 --> 42:43.328
(gunfire, explosions
in the distance)
