and loved your essay.

19:55.830 --> 19:57.750
Thank you so much. [laughs]

19:57.750 --> 20:02.170
But, and this is
a very big but...

20:03.790 --> 20:07.830
I'm talking, humongous,
elephant sized but...

20:10.250 --> 20:12.620
How could you
show up wearing

20:12.620 --> 20:15.880
that sorry excuse
for an outfit?

20:18.040 --> 20:23.880
Because... this sorry excuse
for an outfit

20:23.880 --> 20:25.080
is what fashion
is all about.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.750
It's called taking risks,
and you may not like

20:27.750 --> 20:33.080
my version of Boho chic
with a seagull sauce twist...

20:34.830 --> 20:36.670
but, the point is,
at least I had the guts

20:36.670 --> 20:38.000
to take a chance,
and even if you hate it...

20:38.000 --> 20:40.040
I do.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.620
...at least you're gonna
remember what I wore.

20:42.620 --> 20:44.670
Marisa Miller doesn't
fade into the woodwork

20:44.670 --> 20:45.880
when she could stand out.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.790
Why take a dip
when you can make a splash?

20:48.790 --> 20:52.790
That is the philosophy
I will bring with me to F.I.T.

20:52.790 --> 20:55.880
And why, one day,
everyone will want to wear

20:55.880 --> 20:57.880
a Marisa Miller original.

21:06.710 --> 21:08.830
I'm glad I packed these
experimental grappling belts.

21:08.830 --> 21:09.750
They're working great.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.250
These are experimental?

21:11.250 --> 21:12.920
Have they even been tested?

21:12.920 --> 21:17.250
Of course.
Being tested right now.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.750
If we fall from up here,
we could die!

21:19.750 --> 21:21.210
Oh, relax, we're not gonna die
from a fall.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.670
[laser zaps]

21:24.880 --> 21:27.880
You're right, we could die
from laser fire!

[sighs]

21:42.830 --> 21:45.250
So?

21:45.250 --> 21:48.000
She said I had
excellent qualifications.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.080
Great.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.040
But then she made fun
of my outfit.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.960
Not so great.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.000
But then I acted
like I belonged at F.I.T.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.210
And?

21:57.210 --> 22:00.830
And, starting this Fall,

22:00.830 --> 22:03.080
I'm gonna be sitting
on that old lady's lap.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.920
-You're in?
-I'm in!

22:04.920 --> 22:07.750
-Oh!
-[laughs]

22:12.750 --> 22:17.000
Is it my imagination
or are we still hugging?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.670
Looks that way.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.710
Do you want me to stop?

22:21.710 --> 22:23.330
Not particularly.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.880
Wait, are you hugging me
because you're on a mission

22:29.880 --> 22:33.040
and your assignment
is to hug people?

22:35.290 --> 22:41.290
No, uh, this is a standard,
off-duty,

22:41.290 --> 22:43.960
I think
I really like you hug.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.210
Really?

22:46.210 --> 22:49.080
I think
I really like you, too.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.380
But, uh, before we get
any more involved,

22:53.380 --> 22:56.080
I hope you're okay
with long-distance relationships

22:56.080 --> 22:59.290
because, coming this Fall,
I'm going to F.I.T.!

[K.C.] What are you doing?

23:21.710 --> 23:23.290
Ernie, we are
sitting ducks here.

23:23.290 --> 23:24.830
We need to get up there.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.250
Um, I'm kind of stuck
to you.

23:26.250 --> 23:28.210
You're gonna
have to carry me.

23:28.210 --> 23:29.250
Don't worry about it.
I'm used to it.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.000
I've been carrying you
for three years.
