00:00.001 --> 00:02.434
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Let's have some fun:</i>

00:02.436 --> 00:04.103
<i>You'll recall</i>
<i>jane was accidentally</i>

00:04.105 --> 00:06.405
<i>Artificially inseminated</i>
<i>with rafael's sample.</i>

00:06.407 --> 00:07.606
<i>And guess what?</i>

00:07.608 --> 00:10.175
<i>You know who wasn't</i>
<i>happy about this development?</i>

00:10.177 --> 00:11.510
<i>Jane's ex-fiancÃ©, michael.</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.412
We belong together.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.680
<i>Also unhappy:</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:16.515
<i>Rafael's ex-wife petra.</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:18.017
<i>But she was rebounding</i>
<i>since she gained control</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:19.018
<i>Of the marbella hotel.</i>

00:19.020 --> 00:20.652
From now on, I am the face

00:20.654 --> 00:22.788
Of the marbella.
<i>Unfortunately, petra had made</i>

00:22.790 --> 00:24.757
<i>A few enemies in the hotel,</i>
<i>including lachlan.</i>

00:24.759 --> 00:27.393
I warned you. And then you
screwed me over again.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.461
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane's mother had fallen</i>
<i>in love with her father,</i>

00:29.463 --> 00:31.463
<i>International telenovela star</i>
<i>rogelio de la vega.</i>

00:31.465 --> 00:34.666
<i>Unfortunately, he was fired</i>
<i>from his telenovela.</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:37.136
<i>But he chose to stay in town</i>
<i>for xiomara,</i>

00:37.138 --> 00:39.471
<i>Even though it meant working</i>
<i>under his rival, esteban.</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:42.141
<i>And jane and rafael just had</i>
<i>a scary doctor's appointment.</i>

00:42.143 --> 00:43.609
An echogenic focus
can be a marker

00:43.611 --> 00:46.311
For abnormalities
in the fetus.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.547
Latin lover narrator:
<i>So they got an amnio and we're</i>
<i>now waiting for the results</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:50.616
<i>And I think they're due</i>
<i>any minute.</i>

00:51.684 --> 00:53.552
<i>As a young girl,</i>

00:53.554 --> 00:55.320
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>

00:55.322 --> 00:57.156
<i>Loved asking questions.</i>

00:57.158 --> 00:58.791
What makes the sky blue?

00:59.759 --> 01:03.362
Did jesus have
a last name?

01:03.364 --> 01:06.331
What's the deal with
the electoral college?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.801
Turns out this whole electoral
college thing is crazy.

01:08.803 --> 01:11.737
We're not even actually
voting for our president.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.739
I know.
We're voting for electors

01:13.741 --> 01:15.407
Who are then pledged
to a candidate.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.142
What?!
Then why'd you ask?

01:17.144 --> 01:18.777
Because you've voted
in two elections.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.813
It was time you understood
the process.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.414
Ha, ha.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.652
Mom...

01:26.654 --> 01:28.654
What does love feel like?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.222
Why?

01:30.224 --> 01:32.091
Just curious.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.760
How do you know for sure
you're in love?

01:34.762 --> 01:37.830
It sort of feels like...

01:37.832 --> 01:39.665
Your heart is glowing,

01:39.667 --> 01:41.433
If that makes sense.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.869
It doesn't.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.704
Latin lover narrator:
<i>See, for jane, every question</i>

01:45.706 --> 01:47.172
<i>Had to have a clear answer.</i>

01:47.174 --> 01:49.875
Is there some sort of test
you can run,

01:49.877 --> 01:52.177
To measure the amount
of endorphins or something?

01:52.179 --> 01:55.347
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But never did an answer</i>
<i>mean more to jane</i>

01:55.349 --> 01:57.516
<i>Than the one</i>
<i>she was waiting on today.</i>

01:59.185 --> 02:02.621
<i>And in this case,</i>
<i>there was a very clear test.</i>

02:02.623 --> 02:05.791
They said that we'd have
the results by 9:00.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.826
The doctors are getting
into their offices,

02:07.828 --> 02:09.128
They're getting their coffee,
they have to listen

02:09.130 --> 02:10.362
To their messages.
Yeah.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.864
Yeah, you're right.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.601
I'm just going
to call anyway.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.902
You know?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.775
Hi, this is jane villanueva.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.478
I'm calling to get the results
from my amniocentesis.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.713
Thank you.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.381
They're gonna get dr. Hillcroft.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.155
Hello...

02:36.157 --> 02:37.389
Paging dr. Hillcroft...

02:37.391 --> 02:41.193
Oh, hi, dr. Hillcroft,
sorry, sorry.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.528
I...
Hi, how are you?

02:48.935 --> 02:51.470
Okay.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.840
Thank you so much,
dr. Hillcroft.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.241
Of course.
Thank you.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.876
And I'm so sorry again.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.278
Okay, bye.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.614
The baby's healthy?
Mm-hmm.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.383
Thank god.
Mm-hmm.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.718
I love you.
I love you, too.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.887
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

03:08.889 --> 03:11.223
<i>That if there were</i>
<i>an endorphin test,</i>

03:11.225 --> 03:12.891
<i>These two would score</i>
<i>through the roof.</i>

03:12.893 --> 03:14.927
Oh...

03:14.929 --> 03:16.828
Okay.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.397
Uh-huh.
(laughs)

03:18.399 --> 03:20.232
So now that we know
our baby's healthy...

03:20.234 --> 03:21.466
Uh-huh?

03:21.468 --> 03:24.469
...It's time to unpin,
right?

03:24.471 --> 03:27.206
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should explain...</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:30.676
Let's move in together.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.312
Can we put a pin in that?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.480
I've been thinking
about this a lot.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.985
And I really want
to say yes,

03:39.987 --> 03:41.620
But I can't.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.889
I just had this order, you know?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.490
How my life would lay out.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.960
Date, get engaged,

03:47.962 --> 03:49.895
Get married, have a baby.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.899
And, yes, the baby thing
happened first...

03:53.901 --> 03:56.868
But I don't want to just
throw out the whole order.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.805
Or-or... Or rather,
I want to,

03:59.807 --> 04:02.007
But I can't.

04:02.009 --> 04:06.511
Despite the fact that it would
make life much easier...

04:06.513 --> 04:10.549
And despite the fact
that I love you so much.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.985
I get it.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.889
Xiomara:
<i>Wow.</i>

04:17.891 --> 04:19.925
(both gasping)

04:19.927 --> 04:21.760
Whoa.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.997
That was... Incredible.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.999
(exhales)
thank you.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.001
But I can't take
all the credit.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.869
Rogelio...
Mm...

04:30.871 --> 04:32.871
Yeah.
We talked about this.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.773
Oh... Yes, yes.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.774
I'm sorry.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.609
You were incredible, too.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.012
(chuckling):
You're such a weirdo.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.547
(phone ringing)

04:43.916 --> 04:46.985
It is the costumer
from <i>pasiÃ³n intergalÃ¡ctica.</i>

04:46.987 --> 04:49.321
Hello.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.657
This is rogelio de la vega--
or should I say

04:51.659 --> 04:55.294
Juan rodrigo castillo,
interplanetary detective?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.663
Yes, excellent.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.299
I'll be there. And don't worry,
I'm very easy to dress.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.833
Everything looks good on me.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.903
Except peach.
I don't pop in peach.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.339
Okay. Great.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.341
Thank you.

05:09.343 --> 05:13.045
They seem very excited
to see me.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.747
So... How do <i>you</i> feel

05:15.749 --> 05:17.516
About working under esteban?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.685
Excellent.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.020
It's a great role.
I mean, sure, it's not the lead,

05:22.022 --> 05:24.690
But my jurisdiction covers
147 planets

05:24.692 --> 05:26.992
In four different star systems.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.927
So you're not putting on
a show just for me?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.930
No. I'm not.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.099
I must go.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.501
I'm late for a seaweed soak
and sauna.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.903
Care to join me?
Maybe another time.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.438
Okay.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.741
I will be live-tweeting
from the spa-- follow my feed.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.598
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

06:06.600 --> 06:09.368
Michael:
Jane.
Oh, hey.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.803
Hi. So, listen... Oh, sorry.
Okay. See you later. Oh.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.805
I just... I wanted
to tell you something.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.607
Um, I just saw
angelique harper checking in.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.843
What?! Here?!

06:17.845 --> 06:18.877
Yes.
Seriously?

06:18.879 --> 06:19.945
Like, five minutes ago.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.913
Oh, my god.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.152
Really? <i>Frontier lust?</i>

06:27.154 --> 06:31.022
You cannot judge it
by its title.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.093
Or by its cover.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.129
Okay. Look at these two.

06:37.131 --> 06:39.030
Is this... (chuckles)
really how it's...

06:39.032 --> 06:40.832
They're representing
life on the frontier?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.135
How would you know what life
on the frontier was like?

06:43.137 --> 06:44.169
You weren't there.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.004
Just admit the books are cheesy.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.407
Angelique harper
is not cheesy, all right?

06:48.409 --> 06:52.411
She writes beautiful, sweeping,
romantic, epic love stories...
(laughing)

06:52.413 --> 06:54.479
Why are you laughing?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.987
Anyway, I just wanted to tell
you that angelique was here.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.956
And to remind you
that stalking is a crime.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.426
Florida penal
code section 784.

07:07.428 --> 07:10.061
Don't worry, detective.
I'm gonna play it cool.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.798
Angelique harper is staying
at the marbella!

07:12.800 --> 07:13.799
You like her?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.667
I love her-- love, love,

07:15.669 --> 07:17.436
Love her!
And she's staying here,

07:17.438 --> 07:19.137
At this very hotel--
what are the odds?

07:19.139 --> 07:20.839
I mean, we do host a lot of
authors, so...

07:20.841 --> 07:21.840
Rhetorical question.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.141
Well...

07:23.143 --> 07:25.744
She does have
this private reading tonight.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.112
Do you
want to...?
Yes.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.814
I'm definitely going.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.982
And I'll ask her
to read my first chapter.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.452
You know, just for advice.
And maybe I'll get discovered

07:33.454 --> 07:35.520
Because she's so blown away
by my writing. Or not.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.122
But maybe.
Okay.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.224
But I hear she's pretty private.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.158
So...

07:40.160 --> 07:41.626
Maybe don't accost her.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.828
I would never.
(scoffs)

07:43.696 --> 07:45.697
Okay, I would. I could.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.632
But I promise I won't.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.001
That's why I'm getting it out,
here and now.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.770
I'm gonna meet angelique harper.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.573
That's gonna happen! Yes.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.247
(imitates whip cracking)

08:02.249 --> 08:03.849
Look at me.
Look at my feet.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.250
They're doing them on their own.

08:07.186 --> 08:08.086
Okay, I'm leaving.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.521
Yes.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.156
Mwah.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.692
Yeah!
(chuckling)

08:13.694 --> 08:15.760
Oh. Hey.
Oh, uh, here.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.864
(humming happily)

08:18.866 --> 08:20.131
Scott, come in.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.103
How's life with petra?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.041
Soul-crushing, frankly.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.277
I'm sorry to hear that.
And, look,
she would kill me

08:32.279 --> 08:36.515
If she knew I was here, but,
uh, I wanted to tell you...

08:36.517 --> 08:38.283
Lachlan's been calling.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.118
And I overheard petra say
that she's not returning

08:40.120 --> 08:43.755
His phone calls because she
wanted to fire him in person.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.590
Rafael:
<i>Petra.</i>

08:45.592 --> 08:47.926
Petra, hold on.
You can't fire lachlan. Just...

08:47.928 --> 08:49.194
Look at his contract.
If you fire him,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.096
He gets a million dollar buyout.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.597
(chuckles)
don't worry.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.999
I know how to handle lachlan.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.267
Petra, hold on.
Wait, you need me.

08:55.269 --> 08:56.835
You can't run this hotel alone.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.303
Watch me.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.839
Jane:
<i>"she slammed the door</i>

09:00.841 --> 09:04.175
<i>And pushed her lover</i>
<i>against the wall..."</i>

09:04.177 --> 09:07.145
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Inspired by angelique's</i>
<i>arrival,</i>

09:07.147 --> 09:08.313
<i>Jane threw herself</i>
<i>into her writing</i>

09:08.315 --> 09:11.917
<i>With a renewed energy</i>
<i>and passion.</i>

09:14.186 --> 09:16.888
<i>And when jane's writing</i>
<i>was flowing,</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:18.323
<i>It was as if</i>
<i>she had been transformed</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:19.591
<i>Into another person--</i>

09:19.593 --> 09:22.594
<i>A woman named... Juana.</i>

09:22.596 --> 09:26.598
(lush, romantic
orchestral music playing)

09:26.600 --> 09:29.568
<i>I'd like to tell you</i>
<i>what she'd written,</i>

09:29.570 --> 09:31.336
<i>But I'm feeling</i>
<i>a little self-conscious.</i>

09:31.338 --> 09:33.305
<i>I will say this:</i>

09:33.307 --> 09:36.241
<i>She writes it</i> very <i>well.</i>

09:38.344 --> 09:41.112
â™ª

09:47.587 --> 09:49.754
(applause)

09:56.329 --> 10:00.065
Thank you all
so much for coming.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.300
I am very excited to be here.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.603
Woman:
We love you, angelique!
(chuckles)

10:06.272 --> 10:08.206
I love you, too!

10:08.208 --> 10:10.208
Now zip it. (chuckles)
(audience laughs)

10:10.210 --> 10:12.811
So, tonight,
I'd like to do

10:12.813 --> 10:15.814
A reading
of a new novel I'm working on.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.816
A sneak peek, if you will.

10:17.818 --> 10:21.353
So, without further ado...

10:21.355 --> 10:24.255
"the night

10:24.257 --> 10:26.291
"whistled with promise.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.960
"of music. Of romance.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.129
"of magic.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.398
"at least,
that's what jane thought.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.401
"as she sat in the crowd
of the reading,

10:36.403 --> 10:39.137
"jane felt that she was
on the cusp of something.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.907
"something that could
change her life.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.943
"and so without knowing
why just yet,

10:44.945 --> 10:48.413
She stood up."

10:48.415 --> 10:50.415
Stand up, jane.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.150
Latin love narrator:
<i>Stand, jane!</i>

10:52.152 --> 10:54.319
<i>This is not a fantasy thing.</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:56.354
Jane?

10:57.823 --> 10:59.391
<i>I'm serious! Get your butt up!</i>

11:02.361 --> 11:03.762
"suddenly...

11:03.764 --> 11:05.997
"jane saw him approaching.

11:05.999 --> 11:10.068
Her one true love."

11:15.341 --> 11:16.975
(audience gasps)

11:18.411 --> 11:21.179
What are you doing?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.380
I'm proposing.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.215
Jane...

11:24.217 --> 11:26.384
I know that romance novels
are all about fate

11:26.386 --> 11:28.420
And destiny.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.089
But I don't think there's
ever been one written

11:31.091 --> 11:33.291
That could come
anywhere close to our story.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.959
If there were ever
two people

11:34.961 --> 11:37.429
Who were just destined
to be together...

11:37.431 --> 11:39.297
It's us.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.466
Jane?

11:46.439 --> 11:49.207
Will you marry me?

11:55.981 --> 11:58.049
Can we talk in private?

12:03.856 --> 12:05.190
Latin lover narrator:
<i>So, just to recap:</i>

12:05.192 --> 12:07.192
<i>Rafael has</i>
<i>just proposed to jane</i>

12:07.194 --> 12:11.196
<i>In the most romantic way,</i>
<i>in front of a hundred people.</i>

12:11.198 --> 12:13.164
<i>And jane's response was...</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:15.800
<i>"can we talk in private?"</i>

12:15.802 --> 12:18.403
I'm sorry.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.105
I just didn't expect this.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.906
Yeah, proposals are
usually surprises.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.208
I know that.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.111
But there are usually
discussions first.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.280
Well, I mean, with
all the hinting?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.448
What "hinting"?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.150
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

12:32.152 --> 12:33.451
<i>I think I know</i>
<i>what's going on here.</i>

12:33.453 --> 12:35.186
When we talked about moving in?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.789
You were hinting about
getting engaged?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.824
<i>See, I recently watched</i>
<i>a few episodes</i>

12:39.826 --> 12:43.128
<i>Of a premium cable drama</i>
<i>that touches on subjectivity.</i>

12:45.898 --> 12:47.899
I just have this order,
you know?

12:47.901 --> 12:50.368
Date, engaged...

12:50.370 --> 12:53.271
Get married, then have a baby.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.973
And just because this baby thing
happened first,

12:54.975 --> 12:58.009
I don't want to throw out
the whole order.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.111
Or rather, I do.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.847
I really, really want to.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.183
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yeah, guys hear</i>

13:05.185 --> 13:07.218
<i>What they want to hear.</i>

13:07.220 --> 13:08.553
(sighs)
okay.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.156
So I misinterpreted.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.191
But it got me here.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.193
And like I said in my proposal,

13:15.195 --> 13:17.829
It just feels meant to be.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.830
Doesn't it?

13:18.832 --> 13:20.532
Jane, life is short.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.933
And we found each other.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.169
So let's not waste time.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.906
Marry me.

13:32.178 --> 13:35.180
I told him
I would think about it.
Think about what?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.881
You've known each other
for less than six months.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.349
I know. It's too quick, right?

13:38.351 --> 13:41.152
I mean, that-that's
what I was thinking.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.457
I know. I was thinking
about that, too.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.394
Really, ma?

13:51.297 --> 13:52.397
Because they hardly
know each other?

13:54.200 --> 13:55.200
What do you mean
what do I know?

13:55.202 --> 13:56.601
I know a lot of stuff!

13:56.603 --> 13:59.270
(both speaking at once,
in english and spanish)

14:04.210 --> 14:05.410
Petra.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.444
Lachlan.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.580
You look... The same.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.349
And you wear money well,
as always.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.585
Well, let's get on with it.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.353
We both know
you wanted me back here,

14:15.355 --> 14:17.288
So you could fire me in person.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.323
No, I'm not gonna fire you.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.325
If I fire you,
you get a payout.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.193
I brought you
back here to work.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.296
Unless, of course,
you'd like to quit.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.932
(bell dings)

14:29.301 --> 14:31.336
Scott:
<i>Someone's in there.</i>

14:31.338 --> 14:34.038
Said you were expecting him?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.444
Aaron, hello.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.387
Look, this really
isn't a great time.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.256
I know, and I'm sorry
to bother you.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.457
I understand it's painful.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.325
But I'm just looking
for a little res...

14:54.327 --> 14:56.461
Don't move!

15:03.135 --> 15:04.302
Spider.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.637
You almost stepped on him.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.639
On the spider?

15:07.641 --> 15:09.240
Yes.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.277
I'm a jain.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.611
"a jane"?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.346
Latin lover narrator:
<i>What jane? Our jane?</i>

15:15.348 --> 15:17.215
Jainism-- it's my faith.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.152
It's an indian religion

15:21.154 --> 15:23.321
Rooted in nonviolence.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.156
"nonviolence"

15:25.158 --> 15:27.191
To-to bugs?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.994
To all living creatures.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.996
Wow. You're...

15:31.998 --> 15:33.998
Really different
than your brother.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.566
Which is why we didn't speak
for a long time.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.469
Petra, look.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.472
I know you were having
an affair with him.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.475
Please. I hold no judgment.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.177
But I would like to hear more
about his last days.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.546
I don't even know
where his remains are.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.352
They're respectfully scattered.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.220
Hmm.

15:56.222 --> 16:00.124
Please, let's have a meal
and talk about roman.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.961
For closure.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.395
Rogelio:
This is ridiculous.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.496
I play hard-boiled

16:05.498 --> 16:07.031
Interplanetary
detective castillo.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.533
How is anyone going
to take me seriously

16:08.535 --> 16:10.234
If I wear these
ridiculous...?!
I'm sorry.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.470
Is there a problem?

16:14.073 --> 16:15.740
Well, actually, there is.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.343
You see, my costume is peach.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.078
I don't pop in peach.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.379
That was
a creative decision.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.748
I happen to pop <i>against</i> peach.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.523
Jane:
Found what?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.430
Ma, you gotta be kidding.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.000
Jane:
"how to know if he's the one."

16:43.435 --> 16:45.436
Ma, this thing is
from the middle ages.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.180
"does he give you
ample allowance?"

16:56.182 --> 16:57.382
Xiomara:
Mm-hmm.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.117
(laughs)
"does he...?"

16:59.119 --> 17:01.252
"does he eat what you serve him
without complaint?"

17:01.254 --> 17:03.654
Oh, my god,
this is hilarious.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.456
(laughing):
I told you. So stupid.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.658
Oh-- does he help you
clean the cave?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.460
Do you ride
dinosaurs together?

17:21.340 --> 17:24.208
Yes, he is.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.144
Mm-hmm.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.318
He's incredibly kind.
Mm.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.198
(groaning and panting)

17:47.200 --> 17:48.499
Gym's closed.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.469
Already worked out today--
chest and arms.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.438
I have a
proposal for you.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.573
Not interested.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.843
You know the old saying,
"the enemy of my enemy
is my friend"?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.511
(panting)

18:00.513 --> 18:03.448
(sighs)

18:03.450 --> 18:06.451
I thought for sure petra would
screw up and fire me,

18:06.453 --> 18:09.687
Send me off into the sunset
with my golden parachute.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.123
I assume you told
her not to do it.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.459
It's in my best interest
that the marbella succeed.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.794
We can't afford
to take a million-dollar hit.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.362
Then use me.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.797
I know this business
better than anyone.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.532
Frankly, the marbella
stands a much better chance

18:21.534 --> 18:22.867
Under our leadership
than under petra's.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.769
Petra has
the controlling shares.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.638
Yes... And
I have this.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.340
(woman and man
moaning passionately)

18:29.342 --> 18:31.542
Camera work's a little sloppy,
but you get the idea.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.512
(passionate moaning continues)

18:34.514 --> 18:37.248
Turn-turn that off, man.
What is wrong with you?

18:38.817 --> 18:41.686
My point is,
I threaten to release this--

18:41.688 --> 18:43.888
The marbella hotel has
a board of conservatives

18:43.890 --> 18:46.157
Who already doubt petra's
business savvy.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.792
If this got out,

18:47.794 --> 18:49.660
Not only would it be
humiliating,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.629
But it would also
discredit her completely.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.332
What I'm proposing to you
is that we use this

18:54.334 --> 18:56.200
To blackmail her
into reinstating you.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.402
And once you're in power...

18:58.404 --> 19:00.771
We release it anyway, and get
her off the board for good.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.247
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

19:09.249 --> 19:11.449
<i>That one question kept running</i>
<i>through jane's mind.</i>

19:11.451 --> 19:13.484
<i>Two questions, actually.</i>

19:17.523 --> 19:18.589
Jane.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.626
Oh. Hi.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.764
Sorry. This was your food truck
originally,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.733
So, you should have custody
of it.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.169
It's okay.
Good, 'cause I was
having a craving. (laughs)

19:31.171 --> 19:32.470
It's fine. It's fine.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.572
Uh, alex, another cubano.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.542
Jane!
Hey, alex.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.478
So this is why
I haven't seen you! A baby!

19:40.480 --> 19:43.447
Oh, yeah.
Now it's all making sense.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.449
This is why
the wedding was postponed.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.618
Fiona, get over here!

19:47.620 --> 19:49.420
Jane: Well, no, it's not
exactly like that.
They're having a baby.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.722
Jane:
No, you...
Oh, my goodness...

19:51.724 --> 19:53.658
It's not really like that.
Hey, no, we're actually not.
We're not...

19:53.660 --> 19:54.592
(overlapping chatter)

19:54.594 --> 19:55.593
And so, it's like...

19:55.595 --> 19:58.229
We're not having a baby!

20:00.632 --> 20:02.967
I'm having a baby.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.438
Um, I'm just...
With somebody else.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.908
I'll get those cubanos.

20:13.745 --> 20:18.583
So, did you attack angelique
and give her your manuscript?

20:18.585 --> 20:22.753
Not yet, and I take issue
with "attack."

20:22.755 --> 20:25.489
"as she watched him toss
his cowboy hat on the floor

20:25.491 --> 20:28.426
"and stride over, the
feeling was overwhelming.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.461
She needed him."

20:30.463 --> 20:32.697
Oh.
"she needed
him in a way

20:32.699 --> 20:35.866
"she had never needed anything.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.702
"she needed his hands

20:37.704 --> 20:39.537
"on her body,

20:39.539 --> 20:43.007
His lips on her mouth."

20:43.009 --> 20:45.810
Admit it. You're totally
getting into this.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.379
Oh, I am most definitely
into this...
(laughs)

20:48.381 --> 20:50.681
But it is not
because of the story.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.684
(moaning)

20:53.686 --> 20:56.020
Two cubanos.
Thank you.
Thank you.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.989
Oh, here let me pay.
No, I got it.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.624
It... No, it's...
I got it.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.626
Thank you.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.929
No problem.
Oh.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.598
Uh...
Oh... (anxious laugh)

21:07.600 --> 21:09.333
Okay, I'll see you soon.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.335
Okay, see ya.

21:11.337 --> 21:14.005
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Quite sad.</i>

21:15.407 --> 21:17.808
<i>Also sad-- xiomara,</i>

21:17.810 --> 21:21.579
Because she still hadn't gotten
<i>a visit from aunt flo.</i>

21:21.581 --> 21:23.714
Your door wasn't locked.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.316
It shouldn't be unlocked.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.318
<i>Also sad-- rogelio,</i>

21:27.320 --> 21:30.321
<i>After playing second fiddle</i>
<i>to esteban all day.</i>

21:30.323 --> 21:31.789
Well, how'd it go?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.791
<i>Not that he'd let</i>
<i>xiomara know that.</i>

21:33.793 --> 21:36.494
In a word--

21:36.496 --> 21:39.497
Magnificent.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.333
Turns out I'm equally talented
in outer space

21:42.335 --> 21:43.701
As I am here on earth.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.538
What's the matter?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.540
(scoffs)
it's nothing.

21:49.542 --> 21:53.711
Xiomara, I thought we're going
to be honest about our feelings.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.481
I'm a little late.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.484
And I missed a pill
or two this month.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.621
And I'm worried
I might be pregnant.

22:06.425 --> 22:07.625
Wow.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.694
Is that all you
have to say?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.696
No. No.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.532
While unexpected,

22:14.534 --> 22:17.868
It would be
a blessing, xiomara.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.471
Really?

22:20.473 --> 22:21.906
Is that how you feel?

22:31.049 --> 22:32.683
Gotcha!

22:32.685 --> 22:34.485
What?!

22:34.487 --> 22:36.921
You should have
seen your face.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.556
(chuckles nervously)

22:38.558 --> 22:40.791
Xiomara,
are you serious?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.728
(laughing):
Holy crap!

22:43.730 --> 22:45.730
I was freaking out.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.565
Freaking... Thank...

22:47.567 --> 22:52.036
Thank god, because this would
have been a disaster.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.072
I knew it!
What?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.675
I knew you didn't feel
like it was a blessing.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.744
I actually might
be pregnant.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.380
What?!

23:02.382 --> 23:03.814
You were testing me?

23:03.816 --> 23:06.584
I thought we were
gonna be honest

23:06.586 --> 23:07.818
About our feelings.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.886
Going to be honest?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.721
You told me you were
on the pill.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.956
Were you trying
to trap me?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.657
Trap you?
Are you serious?

23:13.659 --> 23:16.594
You are free to walk out
that door any time you want.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.028
Good, then maybe I will.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.430
Great, then maybe
you should.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.698
Maybe I will.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.932
You already said that.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.167
I'm repeating myself.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.474
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, across town,</i>

23:30.476 --> 23:32.910
<i>Another test was about</i>
<i>to be administered.</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:35.913
<i>Oh, man, it's hard not</i>
<i>to get all carrie bradshaw.</i>

23:35.915 --> 23:38.916
<i>Anyway, observe jane</i>
<i>and rafael...</i>

23:38.918 --> 23:40.918
<i>At the beach.</i>

23:40.920 --> 23:42.920
Thanks for meeting me.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.555
I know you're
busy today.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.957
Eh, it's just all
normal hotel craziness.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.726
It can wait.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.961
And you said
you wanted to talk.
Yes.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.096
But not about
the proposal.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.198
I know,
I got your text.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.133
Just didn't want you
coming and expecting...

23:56.135 --> 23:59.570
About whether or not
you wanted to marry me?

24:00.872 --> 24:02.940
I get it.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.942
Still thinking.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.578
Yeah, I've been thinking about
a lot of things, actually.

24:09.047 --> 24:13.484
I mean, like, what's my life
gonna look like after the baby?

24:13.486 --> 24:15.553
What's my plan?

24:17.589 --> 24:19.590
And I really think

24:19.592 --> 24:23.594
I need to kind of take time
off from everything else.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.863
You know, and just focus
on being a great mom.

24:25.865 --> 24:30.801
And after a few years, I'll get
back to writing and all that.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.670
What do you think?

24:35.674 --> 24:37.741
Of course, if that's
what you want.

24:43.682 --> 24:44.882
(sighs)

24:44.884 --> 24:46.884
Hold on.
What?

24:46.886 --> 24:49.920
I was trying to be supportive,
but that makes no sense to me.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.856
You've been dreaming
about becoming a writer

24:51.858 --> 24:53.524
Since the day
that I met you.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.625
Why would you
give that up?

24:57.262 --> 24:58.762
I'm really glad
you said that.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.233
You passed the test.

25:02.235 --> 25:04.635
The test?
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oy.</i>

25:04.637 --> 25:06.837
Yeah, it was this quiz that
my grandmother gave me.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.073
She took it before she decided
to marry my grandfather.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.609
She thought it
would help me out.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.677
Well, look, I know
that it's silly,

25:13.679 --> 25:15.012
But it's...
You know, like,

25:15.014 --> 25:17.081
There's a lot of things
I need to sort out.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.083
Gotcha.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.085
So you, uh...

25:21.087 --> 25:23.087
Anything else
that I can answer for you?

25:23.089 --> 25:25.089
Like a blood test
or urinanalysis or something?
Stop.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.690
You know, there's also a
question about overreacting.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.527
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry-- I'm hurt.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.529
I want to marry you.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.264
And I don't need
a test to prove it.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.633
(sighs deeply)

25:35.635 --> 25:36.667
I'm sorry.
This is just not the way

25:36.669 --> 25:38.536
That I saw my proposal going.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.171
We'll talk later.
I'm gonna get back to work.

25:42.841 --> 25:46.143
<i>In that moment, jane wanted</i>
<i>to toss her fears aside</i>

25:46.145 --> 25:48.145
<i>And fling herself</i>
<i>into his arms.</i>

25:48.147 --> 25:50.648
Stop!

25:50.650 --> 25:52.917
(lush, romantic
orchestral music playing)

25:57.055 --> 25:59.156
My love...

25:59.158 --> 26:00.758
You are all I need.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.127
Of course I'll marry you.

26:03.129 --> 26:08.065
Juana... You are
the very air I breathe.

26:08.067 --> 26:11.068
â™ª

26:11.070 --> 26:14.872
<i>But, alas, that was the stuff</i>
<i>of romance novels...</i>

26:14.874 --> 26:19.143
<i>And not real life at all.</i>

26:22.814 --> 26:25.249
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Petra told herself that there</i>
<i>was no need to be nervous.</i>

26:25.251 --> 26:28.786
<i>After all, it was just dinner</i>
<i>with her murdered ex-lover's</i>

26:28.788 --> 26:32.623
<i>Identical twin brother.</i>

26:32.625 --> 26:35.259
I took the liberty
of ordering a few dishes.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.994
Thank you.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.362
It's vegan.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.997
I really appreciate it.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.198
(chuckles)
I'm, uh...

26:41.200 --> 26:42.933
I'm just a bit hungry, so...

26:48.306 --> 26:50.841
Oh. Are we supposed to pray
or something first?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.042
Uh, no.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.713
I'm sorry, I don't eat
root vegetables.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.382
When tubers are uprooted,
the whole plant dies,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.651
Along with countless
microorganisms.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.853
But, please, you enjoy it.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.923
No, seriously.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.191
No judgment.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.193
One of jainism's tenets.

27:13.999 --> 27:14.865
Mm.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.669
Thank you for sitting
with me, petra.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.771
It means a lot.

27:20.773 --> 27:24.808
I know roman was closer to you
than anyone.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.043
Look...

27:26.045 --> 27:28.879
Our relationship, it, um...

27:28.881 --> 27:31.949
Definitely wasn't perfect.

27:33.018 --> 27:35.386
(gasping)

27:35.388 --> 27:36.920
(panting)

27:36.922 --> 27:38.122
I'd imagine.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.890
Since he wanted to marry you

27:39.892 --> 27:41.759
And you were already married.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.996
Your brother was there for me

27:45.998 --> 27:48.866
At a time when I needed him.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.235
I found myself
falling for him.

27:51.237 --> 27:54.238
But in the end, when rafael
agreed to give it another try,

27:54.240 --> 27:57.074
Well...

27:57.076 --> 27:59.877
I just loved him more.

28:00.945 --> 28:03.147
Can I ask you
a question?

28:03.149 --> 28:05.315
Yes, of course.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.851
I was going through some
of roman's belongings,

28:07.853 --> 28:10.320
And something is missing--
a family heirloom.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.222
Uh, my mother's necklace.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.857
It's all I have

28:13.859 --> 28:15.893
Of her and...
I have it.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.961
Roman, uh,

28:17.963 --> 28:19.930
Well, he gave it to me
before he died.

28:19.932 --> 28:20.931
Really?

28:20.933 --> 28:22.099
I can get it to you.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.103
Oh, you should've seen
rafael's face, luca.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.006
He was so crushed.
Well, yeah.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.341
He poured his heart out,
and you stomped all over it.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.077
Not helping.
Um...

28:33.079 --> 28:34.344
I'm about to.
Hmm?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.280
Angelique harper.
Two o'clock.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.749
(quietly):
Hand it over.

28:38.751 --> 28:39.817
Go, go, go, go, go.

28:41.786 --> 28:44.221
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Come on, jane. You got this.</i>

28:44.223 --> 28:47.825
For the hundredth time,
the answer is no!

28:47.827 --> 28:49.993
Now you've put me
in a foul mood.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.129
Tell them that I'm not
talking to them again

28:52.131 --> 28:53.731
Until after my massage.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.733
(sighs)

28:55.735 --> 28:57.101
Petra:
<i>It's not a good time.</i>

28:58.069 --> 28:59.236
We need to talk.
Okay,

28:59.238 --> 29:00.237
What part of "silent partner"

29:00.239 --> 29:01.105
Don't you understand?

29:01.107 --> 29:03.207
I have your sex tape.

29:08.446 --> 29:10.848
Hey, you're home.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.316
Uh, quick question,

29:12.318 --> 29:14.451
Do you remember when you
bought those blue shoes?

29:14.453 --> 29:16.286
Was it a Tuesday or a Wednesday?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.989
I don't remember.
Think, though--

29:18.991 --> 29:21.191
You schedule everything-- and
I remember you brought them home

29:21.193 --> 29:23.393
Around the time that I went to
the movies with slutty crystal.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.795
Mom, what's going on?

29:24.797 --> 29:26.797
Nothing.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.066
You have enough on your mind.
Okay,

29:29.068 --> 29:31.535
Now you definitely
have to tell me.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.406
I'm late.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.909
Late. For what?

29:38.911 --> 29:43.413
My period is late.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.415
But you're on the pill.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.551
I forgot one.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.219
Or two.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.155
Mom...
I know. I know.
And I knew

29:51.157 --> 29:53.490
We should wait, but we got
so caught up in the moment.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.025
Caught up in
the moment?

29:55.027 --> 29:56.260
You're not 16.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.328
It was an accident.
No.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.330
No, it wasn't.

30:00.332 --> 30:03.333
Me standing here pregnant--
that's an accident.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.435
You were reckless.
I mean, what's your plan?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.037
Are we gonna be
pregnant together?

30:07.039 --> 30:08.906
Did you want to raise
these babies like sisters?

30:08.908 --> 30:11.341
No. Look, I didn't have
a plan...
Yeah, I know.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.910
Again.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.912
I'm sorry. I...

30:14.914 --> 30:17.381
I just thought...

30:17.383 --> 30:19.016
I don't know.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.384
I just thought that you would be
more thoughtful

30:20.386 --> 30:22.519
If you thought
about having another kid.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.555
Because of...

30:24.557 --> 30:27.024
Well...

30:27.026 --> 30:30.561
Me.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.337
(petra moaning passionately)

30:40.339 --> 30:43.240
Guys, put that away.

30:46.477 --> 30:48.512
No way.
It gets good at 3:48.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.147
Rafael:
What is that?

30:50.149 --> 30:51.849
Tried to tell you.
Hi, rafael.

30:51.851 --> 30:54.318
Hang on.
(clicks tongue)

30:58.022 --> 30:59.857
Was that my ex-wife?
Uh,

30:59.859 --> 31:00.858
Yes.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.259
And where'd they get that?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.328
I don't know.
But...

31:04.330 --> 31:06.296
It's everywhere.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.003
I didn't release the tape.
It must have been lachlan.

31:13.005 --> 31:16.273
I would never do
something like that.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.243
Petra: Lachlan didn't
release the tape.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.445
I did.

31:21.447 --> 31:25.582
Because as long as it existed,
he could hold it over my head.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.585
Now he has nothing.
I get that,

31:28.587 --> 31:31.555
But the marbella board, they're
a bunch of conservatives.
Yes.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.957
And I'm about to meet with them.

31:33.959 --> 31:36.526
They're going to learn that my
private files have been stolen.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.195
They're going to be
righteously outraged

31:38.197 --> 31:39.463
On my behalf
and they're going to release

31:39.465 --> 31:41.398
This statement,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.967
Condemning this violation
of my privacy.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.402
And what makes you think
they're gonna sign this?

31:45.404 --> 31:47.404
You'll help me convince them.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.606
Because it will help
the marbella.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.244
I think we should
work together.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.681
I would have fired lachlan.
And that

31:57.683 --> 32:01.485
Would have cost us
a million dollars.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.522
When's the board meeting?

32:10.561 --> 32:14.398
So I just found out...

32:14.400 --> 32:16.934
I'm definitely
not pregnant.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.936
Really?

32:18.938 --> 32:21.571
Look, I'm sorry
I was harsh yesterday.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.407
I was...

32:23.409 --> 32:24.608
Stressed.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.143
You were right.

32:26.145 --> 32:29.646
And I've been thinking
about what you said.

32:31.449 --> 32:35.118
And maybe my missing a pill
wasn't a complete accident.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.621
It's just hard,
you know?

32:37.623 --> 32:40.624
'cause being your mom...

32:40.626 --> 32:42.559
Is the only thing
I've been, like,

32:42.561 --> 32:44.261
Successful at.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.163
And now it's

32:46.165 --> 32:47.965
Almost done.
No.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.967
Okay, first: No,

32:49.969 --> 32:52.035
It is not done.

32:52.037 --> 32:56.640
But it's changing.
It's changing,
definitely.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.309
And maybe for
the better.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.712
Maybe it's time your
life changes, too.

33:01.714 --> 33:04.114
I mean, you don't want to
live here forever, right?

33:04.116 --> 33:05.615
In grandma's house?

33:05.617 --> 33:08.452
No, I don't.
Exactly.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.488
So then date rogelio
and see where it goes.

33:11.490 --> 33:15.292
But... Go slowly.

33:15.294 --> 33:18.495
Take it step by step.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.565
You're, like, annoyingly
smart sometimes.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.634
(short chuckle)

33:24.636 --> 33:27.704
Then why can't I
answer this proposal?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.608
Okay, I want to remind you
about something,

33:31.610 --> 33:33.477
But I am afraid if I do,

33:33.479 --> 33:35.145
You're gonna think
it's because I don't think

33:35.147 --> 33:36.680
You should marry
rafael, which is true,

33:36.682 --> 33:39.516
But that's not
why I'm reminding you.
Of what?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.651
The time you found

33:41.653 --> 33:43.720
Michael's list in the book.

33:46.457 --> 33:47.758
<i>(phone rings)</i>

33:47.760 --> 33:51.328
(groans)
can you turn off
my phone, babe?

33:51.330 --> 33:53.630
I'm-I'm doing
a practice test-- timed.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.699
Mm-hmm.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.378
Interesting.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.679
What?

34:16.254 --> 34:18.155
Nothing.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.591
Xiomara:
<i>That night--</i>

34:21.593 --> 34:24.428
The smile on your face--
you were so happy.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.230
Even though you'd only
known each other a year,

34:27.232 --> 34:29.699
You didn't have any questions.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.569
But it wasn't right.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.739
That's not the point.

34:35.741 --> 34:39.709
You    <i>kn</i>what
it's like to be sure.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.216
I'm sorry for testing you.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.585
It's not right,
but I just...

34:48.587 --> 34:52.089
I think I was afraid
of the answer I knew in my gut.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.590
Which is...

34:53.592 --> 34:55.192
I can't marry you.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.594
Not yet.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.530
A-and that look on
your face-- I mean,

35:00.532 --> 35:02.666
That's why I didn't
want to admit it.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.668
To myself, to you.

35:04.670 --> 35:08.138
Because I was scared that
if I turned down your proposal

35:08.140 --> 35:10.173
That would mean
that something would...

35:10.175 --> 35:12.375
Break between us.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.377
That things
would change.

35:14.379 --> 35:16.613
And I don't want that,
because I love you

35:16.615 --> 35:20.650
And I want to get to marriage.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.120
I'm just not there yet.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.322
Because you're not
sure about me.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.858
Because it's too fast.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.460
You think that
life is short. Well,

35:30.462 --> 35:33.230
For me, I think it's long.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.566
And that there are steps
you have to take first.
Yeah,

35:36.568 --> 35:39.169
I get that.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.872
(phone dings)

35:41.874 --> 35:43.373
What's that?

35:43.375 --> 35:44.641
Nothing.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.543
It's stupid. I...

35:46.545 --> 35:49.646
Planned on dropping off
my chapter at angelique's,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.715
Once her massage was finished,

35:51.717 --> 35:53.216
Because she'd be in a good mood.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.818
Go.
No.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.386
Jane...

35:56.388 --> 35:58.755
I just need a second, okay?

35:58.757 --> 36:00.524
To... To be alone,

36:00.526 --> 36:02.392
To lick my wounds.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.795
Just...

36:05.797 --> 36:06.897
Go.

36:06.899 --> 36:09.332
But we're okay?

36:09.334 --> 36:11.334
Yeah.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.403
We will be.

36:20.645 --> 36:22.913
Latin lover narrator:
<i>As she headed toward</i>
<i>angelique's room,</i>

36:22.915 --> 36:26.650
<i>Jane tried to put rafael's</i>
<i>disappointment out of her head.</i>

36:31.322 --> 36:33.390
Angelique:
Come in.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.762
Ms. Harper, hi, I, uh...
Right on time.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.965
Thanks for pushing
the massage an hour later.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.708
Hey, you're jane-- from the
proposal the other night, right?

36:51.710 --> 36:52.909
Um, yeah,
that-that's me.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.778
Boy, that really
went off the rails.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.548
Let me guess-- cute,
rich, but dumb, right?

37:00.818 --> 37:02.586
Oh, for the love...

37:02.588 --> 37:04.888
Even my masseuse
has a manuscript.
Oh, no, no.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.756
I-I-I'm not...
You don't want me

37:06.758 --> 37:08.525
To read that?

37:08.527 --> 37:10.260
Oh.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.829
Well... I-I do, but...
Let's see

37:12.831 --> 37:15.832
How the massage
goes first, okay, honey?

37:18.869 --> 37:21.871
Actually, ms. Harper,

37:21.873 --> 37:23.573
I am...
Shh, shh.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.809
I like a quiet massage.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.812
(whispers):
Okay.

37:59.577 --> 38:00.877
I like it deep.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.046
The harder the better.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.551
Mm, yeah.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.487
Oh, yeah.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.888
Oh, just like that.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.590
Oh, yeah.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.659
Oh, god, I hate
these book tours.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.527
I'm so glad I booked
the extra half-hour.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.829
I'm gonna need every one
of these 90 minutes.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.865
(mouthing)

38:21.867 --> 38:23.933
And I need you
to really work my glutes.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.674
What the hell is this?
We'd like you
to double-check

38:30.676 --> 38:32.776
Every dime spent
in accounts receivable.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.010
That is...

38:34.012 --> 38:35.845
Unless you'd like to quit.

39:11.115 --> 39:13.383
Esteban:
And cut.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.986
Nailed it.
Again.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.626
I came to tell you that...

39:23.628 --> 39:25.495
I'm not pregnant.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.464
Are you testing me?

39:27.466 --> 39:29.132
No, I'm not.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.801
Ah.
And I'm sorry about that.
It was stupid, and...

39:31.803 --> 39:34.871
I'm relieved, too,
because we aren't ready.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.474
No. No, we're not.

39:40.511 --> 39:43.146
But rogelio, why
didn't you tell me?
What?

39:43.148 --> 39:46.483
That your job under
esteban pretty much sucks.

39:46.485 --> 39:50.387
Because I knew you'd feel bad
that I stayed in miami for you.

39:50.389 --> 39:51.521
You're right, I do.

39:51.523 --> 39:52.989
I don't want you
to feel that way.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.058
I'm glad I stayed.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.926
You're worth it.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.928
Xiomara,

39:58.930 --> 40:01.598
I-I care for you-- a lot.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.733
And I want to see
where this goes.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.002
Step by step.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.838
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And maybe it was</i>
<i>rogelio's sweet words</i>

40:08.840 --> 40:10.974
<i>Or jane's scary ones...</i>

40:10.976 --> 40:13.543
I mean, you don't want
to live here forever, right?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.779
In grandma's house?

40:15.781 --> 40:18.014
Latin lover narrator:
<i>...But xo looked at ro</i>

40:18.016 --> 40:21.684
<i>And said something she'd</i>
<i>never said before to a man:</i>

40:21.686 --> 40:24.854
Well... Should we
move in together?

40:24.856 --> 40:26.856
Is that the next step?

40:26.858 --> 40:29.759
Why not? Let's do it.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.064
Hey!

40:35.066 --> 40:36.933
Grabbing
another cubano...
Oh, my god, michael,

40:36.935 --> 40:39.436
I just gave
angelique harper a massage.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.738
What?!
I went to go
give her my chapters,

40:41.740 --> 40:43.039
She pushed back her appointment.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.574
Michael, she stripped down
butt-ass naked.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.009
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so they laughed,</i>

40:46.011 --> 40:48.011
<i>As old friends do.</i>

40:48.013 --> 40:51.047
<i>And how could jane know that,</i>
<i>at that very moment,</i>

40:51.049 --> 40:55.185
For, like 90 min... It was
90 whole minutes, and I cannot

40:55.187 --> 40:56.953
Move my arms more than,
like, this.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.555
Past here.
And is she, is she gonna,
is she gonna read

40:58.557 --> 41:01.958
I don't know. She fell asleep
by the time I was done.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.660
I snuck out.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.862
Latin lover narrator:
<i>How could she know?</i>

41:05.864 --> 41:07.797
(jane laughing)

41:13.637 --> 41:15.171
Hi.
Hi.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.073
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And how could petra know</i>

41:17.075 --> 41:19.709
<i>The value of what</i>
<i>she held in her hand?</i>

41:20.878 --> 41:22.479
Your mother's necklace.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.714
Thank you. I...

41:24.716 --> 41:26.216
I appreciate it.

41:26.218 --> 41:29.052
Um, anyway, I-I should go.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.844
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Like I said,</i>

41:54.846 --> 41:57.080
<i>How could she know?</i>
