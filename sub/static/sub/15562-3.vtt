08:52.299 --> 08:53.665
- "Pretty fast"
is a relative term.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.666
What's your resting
heart rate?

08:54.668 --> 08:57.102
- God, we're gonna have to
figure it out now.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.137
Okay, take your pulse
for ten seconds.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.239
You're gonna multiply
that number by six.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.574
- Dude, you know
the bird flew away,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.042
like, a while ago, right?

09:08.781 --> 09:09.981
- Thanks.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.249
- So just
the morning-after pill?

09:11.251 --> 09:12.717
That would have
been my guess.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.852
My man.
All right.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.854
[sighs]
Okeydokey.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.223
So a couple things you need to
know about this bad boy.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.892
- Hey, Tate.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.194
You want to see
some pictures of my kids?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.195
- No.
Gross.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.098
- Wait till you see
how cute they are.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.234
Children are such a gift.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.635
- Oh.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.104
- How do I
call up these pictures?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.873
All right,
just give me a sec.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.308
"Viewing photos.

09:36.310 --> 09:40.912
Go to the home screen
by tapping Menu button."

09:40.914 --> 09:42.847
- I'm sorry.
We really need to get going.

09:42.849 --> 09:43.848
- Of course.

09:43.850 --> 09:44.849
Glenn, would you just
cut it out?

09:44.851 --> 09:46.017
Let them buy the damn pill.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.919
- Would you
mind very much

09:47.921 --> 09:49.187
if I just
cut in front of you?

09:49.189 --> 09:50.989
I am in a huge rush.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.257
Huge!
- I guess.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.658
- Thank you.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.060
- [sighs]
All right.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.661
- Yeah, hi, I'd like to buy

09:56.663 --> 09:58.863
all of your morning-after pills,
please.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.031
- [chuckles drily]

10:02.768 --> 10:04.102
- Big weekend.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.006
Gonna get all liquored up
and promiscuous.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.709
- I'm happy to try to clean it
up, but the problem is,

10:10.711 --> 10:12.644
if I even think about vom--

10:12.646 --> 10:14.980
[dry heaving]

10:14.982 --> 10:16.748
[burps]
- Oh.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.250
- [dry heaving]

10:19.252 --> 10:20.785
- Okay, okay.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.320
Okay.
I got it.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.055
I'll clean it up.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.323
- [dry heaving]
- Oh, god.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.194
- [retching]
- [groans]

10:29.196 --> 10:30.662
[sighs]
Three more hours.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.997
Three more hours.
Three more hours.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.799
[phone buzzing]

10:34.801 --> 10:36.001
Oh, hey, babe, what's up?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.669
<i>- Hey, please don't be mad,</i>

10:37.671 --> 10:39.337
<i>but Frank just got</i>
<i>last-minute tickets</i>

10:39.339 --> 10:41.239
<i>to the entrepreneurs</i>
<i>conference this weekend,</i>

10:41.241 --> 10:43.642
<i>and I know I said I would</i>
<i>take Emma camping, but--</i>

10:50.716 --> 10:53.218
All right, just dump that
in the cart there.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.186
Okay, that should
draw her out.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.254
- How do you know
it's a woman?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.822
- I'm glad you asked, Mateo.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.058
Birds don't have genitalia
as we're familiar with.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.960
They have internal penises
called cloacas.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.396
- And when they become
very engorged--

11:04.398 --> 11:05.397
[crow caws]

11:05.399 --> 11:07.265
- [screaming]

11:07.267 --> 11:09.968
[crows cawing]
[yelping]

11:09.970 --> 11:11.736
[sighs]

11:11.738 --> 11:13.271
- Look, I'm gonna
give it to you straight.

11:13.273 --> 11:17.175
- You know I'm just gonna
order more of these, right?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.810
- And I'll be standing
right here,

11:18.812 --> 11:21.713
Cloud 9 credit union
card in hand.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.714
- Okay.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.049
Well, that comes to

11:24.051 --> 11:27.052
$1,127
and 54 cents.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.453
- What?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.821
That much?

11:29.823 --> 11:32.791
Well, each pill
is over 40 bucks.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.992
I'd explain why, but

11:33.994 --> 11:36.161
your brain couldn't handle
the science.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.763
- No, no,
I can't afford that.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.298
I mean, well,
with car payments

11:40.300 --> 11:42.734
and mortgage
and groceries for 13,

11:42.736 --> 11:44.235
we're barely getting by.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.303
- Mm.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.404
- I'm gonna have to
return these.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.472
- Mm.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.274
No, you can't return pills.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.475
- What?
- Yeah.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.843
That's illegal.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.178
You could have
tampered with them.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.413
- But you know I didn't.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.082
I was here the whole time.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.883
- Were you?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.086
<i>- I know I said I could take</i>
<i>Emma on the trip.</i>

12:01.088 --> 12:02.087
- Yes, you did.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.922
- Excuse me.
- Just one second.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.257
Adam, I was really looking
forward to this weekend.

12:06.259 --> 12:10.862
I was gonna wear sweatpants
and slippers and no bra.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.198
Can you take
a couple steps back?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.200
<i>- I promise,</i>
<i>I will make it up to you,</i>

12:15.202 --> 12:17.402
<i>but could you please</i>
<i>just let this one go?</i>

12:17.404 --> 12:18.803
- [sighs]
<i>- Just this one time?</i>

12:18.805 --> 12:19.804
- [scoffs]

12:19.806 --> 12:21.940
Just this one time.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.074
Fine.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.342
Okay.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.277
Look, I gotta go.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.746
How can I help you, sir?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.481
- I have a complaint
about one of your salesmen.

12:30.883 --> 12:31.983
- But you said
I have the right

12:31.985 --> 12:33.351
to refuse service
to anybody I want.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.954
- Yes, technically
you have the right,

12:35.956 --> 12:38.022
but you need to
use some common sense.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.760
I would take all of these guns
and throw them out the door.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.961
- You know what I mean.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.195
- Look, I told you
I wasn't comfortable

12:44.197 --> 12:46.464
- Yeah, and I told you
that you have to.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.299
- Ugh, god forbid
you let something go

12:48.301 --> 12:49.367
for once in your life.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.869
- Why do I have to let it go?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.470
Why don't you
let it go, Jonah?

12:52.472 --> 12:53.538
It's not my job to make

12:53.540 --> 12:55.273
every man in the world's
life easier.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.474
I'm not moving you.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.543
- Well, I'm not
changing what I'm doing.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.346
Why is everybody
being such a jerk today?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.148
[wings flap, poop splats]

13:05.084 --> 13:07.085
- I think the bird--
- Yeah.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.319
I know.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.324
[Mr. Mister's "Broken Wings"
playing softly]

13:13.326 --> 13:16.861
[crows cawing]

13:16.863 --> 13:18.363
- I just feel so bad

13:18.365 --> 13:20.498
about letting
my moral priorities

13:20.500 --> 13:23.034
interfere with
your buying choices,

13:23.036 --> 13:25.370
especially because
for all I know,

13:25.372 --> 13:28.106
you might not even be
planning on using the pill.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.541
You know, maybe
you're gonna use them

13:29.543 --> 13:31.876
as plates in a doll's house

13:31.878 --> 13:35.880
or drop 'em in a Diet Coke
to see if they fizz up.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.315
- No, we had unprotected sex
last night.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.950
- Okay,
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!

13:38.952 --> 13:40.952
What I don't know
can't hurt me

13:40.954 --> 13:42.253
or send me to hell.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.389
[laughs feebly]
Just kidding.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.058
Um, so do you have cash?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.927
- I'm sorry; I just have
way too many concerns

13:48.929 --> 13:50.195
about your level of anger.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.229
- This is discrimination.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.831
I'm gonna call the NRA
about this.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.199
- Okay, well, you know,

13:54.201 --> 13:56.568
that you're getting so angry
is only proving my point.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.902
- What is going on?

13:57.904 --> 14:01.339
This entire place
is a dictatorship,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.575
and it's being ruled over
by Emperor Amy.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.044
- Oh, god, can you guys
just act like adults

14:06.046 --> 14:07.412
and have an affair
or something?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.413
- What?
No, shh!

14:08.415 --> 14:09.547
Listen.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.317
If Amy wants me to
run the gun counter,

14:12.319 --> 14:14.152
then Amy needs
to understand

14:14.154 --> 14:16.554
that I get to decide
who gets the guns.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.289
And I'm gonna
make those decisions fairly

14:18.291 --> 14:19.490
and with due diligence.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.159
I'm sorry.
I just don't trust redheads.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.160
- [scoffs]

14:22.162 --> 14:23.328
- Too fiery.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.200
- Congratulations on
being sexually active.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.336
- I'm sorry?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.905
- Okay, I know
I probably can't talk you

14:33.907 --> 14:35.907
out of buying
contraception, right?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.442
I mean, that's just
not gonna happen.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.177
- I didn't ask for
any assistance.

14:39.179 --> 14:43.047
- So if it's gonna happen
no matter what,

14:43.049 --> 14:46.017
these are $50 each.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.186
Okay, now, I'm not looking
to make a profit.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.021
That's the price I paid

14:50.023 --> 14:53.524
plus a small donation
to the pro-life coalition.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.126
You know?
And--

15:03.469 --> 15:05.303
We're all gonna die
in here!

15:05.305 --> 15:06.504
- Whoa, whoa!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.172
- Okay, everybody calm down.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.041
It's just an open carry protest.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.443
Gun owners are just exercising
their second amendment rights.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.678
It's all perfectly legal.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.480
Okay, but let's not
let this little gun thing

15:15.482 --> 15:17.649
overshadow the real problem,
which is the crows.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.317
They are equally as dangerous.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.054
- Well, apparently Jonah
was denying service

15:23.056 --> 15:25.423
to everybody who
wanted to buy a gun, so--

15:25.425 --> 15:27.091
- Oh, what a D bag.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.193
- I shouldn't have been there
in the first place, okay?

15:29.195 --> 15:30.995
Technically,
this is Amy's fault.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.431
- Amy, can you just
move Jonah?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.199
- No, he doesn't get to win.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.936
- Ugh.
Why are you being like this?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.704
- "Like this."
What is "like this"?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.072
I'm doing my job.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.140
- Oh, my god,
just bang already.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.408
- That's what I been saying.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.409
- Gross.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.977
- Eww.
- Okay, okay.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.313
We're all feeling emotional,

15:48.315 --> 15:51.516
but we're gonna get through this
safely together.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.319
And then we can go home
to our loved ones.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.187
Oh, and if you're
planning on

15:56.189 --> 15:59.424
having sex with them tonight,
come see me.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.658
All right, meeting dismissed.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.960
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold up.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.394
What about this crow emergency,
y'all?

16:03.396 --> 16:04.395
Hold up.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.064
Hey, guys,
we gotta do something.

ratio as humans.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.978
- Attention, shoppers.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.112
- Attention.

16:21.114 --> 16:25.149
- I need everyone in the store
to be completely silent

16:25.151 --> 16:30.021
that replicate the calls
of the crows' natural enemies.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.589
This will drive them
out of the store.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.724
