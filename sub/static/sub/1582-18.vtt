00:27.913 --> 00:30.248
Please let it be a bear
that did this.

00:32.818 --> 00:35.186
How much did I eat?

00:36.722 --> 00:38.957
Homie, you can't keep
doing this to yourself.

00:38.991 --> 00:41.259
I'm as healthy as a horse.

00:41.293 --> 00:43.394
Horses only live 30 years.

00:46.165 --> 00:49.868
If you could just ease up
on the eating after 3:00 a.m.

00:49.902 --> 00:52.403
That's all I ask.

00:52.438 --> 00:54.272
Marge is right.

00:54.306 --> 00:56.407
I'm gonna walk upstairs,
take her in my arms

00:56.442 --> 00:58.877
and tell her
my good health starts now!

00:58.911 --> 01:00.578
Mm-hmm!

01:00.613 --> 01:02.714
Legs pumping. Blood flowing.

01:02.748 --> 01:04.616
Two at a time.

01:04.650 --> 01:06.718
Heart exploding.

01:06.752 --> 01:07.952
Ooh. Pepperoni.

01:10.923 --> 01:14.425
All that's left
are clever last words.

01:18.164 --> 01:21.599
And so we mourn the loss
of Homer J. Simpson.

01:21.634 --> 01:26.738
Beloved husband, father
and poorly informed sports fan.

01:26.772 --> 01:29.774
All he did was yell
"traveling" at the screen.

01:29.808 --> 01:32.744
Major condolences
on your bereavement, dear.

01:32.778 --> 01:34.412
If, uh... you know, after

01:34.446 --> 01:36.948
a respectful period of grief
and whatnot, uh...

01:36.982 --> 01:39.951
yous would like to have some
coffee, please give a call.

01:41.353 --> 01:43.288
- Thank you, Moe.
- Stop!

01:43.322 --> 01:46.157
Stop with the wailing
and the gnashing and the aye...

01:46.192 --> 01:48.092
Homer is not dead!

01:48.127 --> 01:49.794
I have made a copy.

01:49.828 --> 01:51.663
I'm number two.

01:52.831 --> 01:54.098
You're alive!

01:54.133 --> 01:55.433
But how?

01:55.467 --> 01:56.801
Uh, well...

01:56.835 --> 02:00.672
I was able to put Homer's
memories in the body of a clone,

02:00.706 --> 02:03.675
identical to the original
in every way.

02:03.709 --> 02:05.176
I wanted to clone a sheep,

02:05.211 --> 02:07.545
but I needed to start
with something simpler.

02:07.580 --> 02:10.148
Which he is,
because his brain is fliveck.

02:10.181 --> 02:12.217
Oh... Dad, you're back!

02:12.251 --> 02:14.686
Just in time
for my recital.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.287
Somebody kill me.

02:16.322 --> 02:18.690
Now, Homie. I hope you use
this second chance

02:18.724 --> 02:20.158
to live a more sensible life.

02:20.192 --> 02:21.392
Amen, baby.

02:21.427 --> 02:23.194
Did you make potato salad
for the wake?

02:23.229 --> 02:24.495
Yes.

02:26.732 --> 02:29.367
That man sure loved
potato salad.

02:30.402 --> 02:31.502
Ah, hey, Midge. Uh...

02:31.537 --> 02:33.571
here we are again, ah?

02:33.606 --> 02:34.872
Yeah...

02:34.907 --> 02:37.475
And, oh, uh, here, uh,
my new card.

02:37.509 --> 02:39.844
Yeah.

02:39.878 --> 02:41.045
I'm back!
Coming through!

02:41.080 --> 02:42.046
Yeah.

02:42.081 --> 02:44.515
I can die all I want.

02:44.550 --> 02:48.353
Frink's got Homers like
the Tuileries has park benches.

02:48.387 --> 02:50.021
Huh? I wonder where
I picked that up.

02:50.055 --> 02:51.889
Oh. I planted a
Western history chip,

02:51.924 --> 02:54.559
but all you retained were
the places to sit down.

02:54.593 --> 02:56.160
Nice!

02:56.195 --> 02:59.030
♪ Letting the days go by

02:59.064 --> 03:00.832

Homer, you'll be
all right,

03:13.779 --> 03:16.414
but, uh, no solid food
for two weeks.

03:16.448 --> 03:18.216
Aw... two weeks?

03:23.922 --> 03:27.292

03:29.295 --> 03:31.629
We are gathered here
to mourn the passing of

03:31.664 --> 03:33.865
yet another Homer Simpson.

03:33.899 --> 03:35.366
Beloved father,

03:35.401 --> 03:38.202
precious memories,
local character, et cetera.

03:38.237 --> 03:40.738
Okay. We're ready
for the crematorium bot.

03:47.279 --> 03:48.279
Wait a minute!

03:55.921 --> 03:57.221
Don't go far, Cremo.

03:57.256 --> 04:00.758
Oh, Moe,
are we doing this again?

04:00.793 --> 04:01.959
You know what? No.

04:01.994 --> 04:03.695
I'm tired of getting
my hopes up here.

04:03.729 --> 04:07.065
You and your immortal husband
can go take a flying leap, huh?

04:07.099 --> 04:09.967
Um, I am so very sorry,
but, uh, this time,

04:10.002 --> 04:13.004
I could not bring Homer
back to life.

04:13.038 --> 04:14.005
Wha...?

04:14.039 --> 04:16.007
Stupid Moe.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.909
You just had to act
like yourself,

04:17.942 --> 04:19.976
didn't you, you jackass?

04:22.113 --> 04:23.481
All is not lost.

04:23.515 --> 04:25.750
I was able to download
Homer's brain

04:25.784 --> 04:26.918
into this flash drive.

04:26.952 --> 04:27.919
It'll have to do.

04:27.953 --> 04:29.921
Yo. Where's my body?

04:29.955 --> 04:31.289
Oh, you used up
all your clones,

04:31.323 --> 04:34.258
you fat, fat, fat,
reckless, fat pig!

04:34.293 --> 04:36.794
From now on, you're just
going to be a face on a monitor.

04:36.829 --> 04:38.596
So, enjoy screen saver mode!

04:39.932 --> 04:42.166
Bonk. Bonk. Bonk.

04:42.201 --> 04:43.601
Ooh. Corner.

04:43.635 --> 04:44.635
Ba-donk.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.270
Let me just say this once.

04:48.574 --> 04:50.575
I'm good.

04:55.514 --> 04:57.548
Hey, kids.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.217
Want to chase Grandpa Homer
around the house?

04:59.251 --> 05:00.318
I do!
Yay!

05:05.357 --> 05:08.359
After 35 years
of wifely obedience,

05:08.394 --> 05:11.062
I'm married to
a face on a screen.

05:11.096 --> 05:13.564
Not exactly fun and games
for me, either, Marge.

05:13.599 --> 05:14.999
Ooh... Goody Gobble!

05:17.669 --> 05:18.970
Liquid center power-up!

05:21.440 --> 05:23.007
How are you, Milhouse?

05:23.041 --> 05:25.042
Things aren't great
with Lisa.

05:25.077 --> 05:27.912
If it wasn't for that squirrel
that eats our bird food,

05:27.946 --> 05:29.981
we'd have nothing to talk about.

05:30.015 --> 05:32.183
As I told you when
we talked last month,

05:32.217 --> 05:35.653
"I've been doing a lot of
charity work for the undead."

05:35.687 --> 05:36.821
Uh, Marge, excuse me.

05:36.855 --> 05:38.423
Uh... I think
I need a reboot.

05:38.457 --> 05:40.858
Just stick the tip of your pen
in that little hole

05:40.893 --> 05:42.360
and hold it for 15 minutes.

05:43.762 --> 05:45.663
No. I'm throwing you
out of the house.

05:45.697 --> 05:47.265
You can live
with your no-good son.

05:47.299 --> 05:48.599
Hey. What did I do?

05:48.634 --> 05:50.234
Nothing for 30 years.

05:50.269 --> 05:51.602
You're perfect
for each other.

05:51.637 --> 05:52.837
No. No. No.
Don't pull me out

05:52.871 --> 05:54.172
before you click eject.

05:54.206 --> 05:55.373
That hurts like a mother...!

05:58.710 --> 06:00.578
So, Dad,
what do you think of my place?

06:00.612 --> 06:02.680
Son, could you
put me in 3-D for a second?

06:03.715 --> 06:04.916
Why, you little...!

06:04.950 --> 06:06.050
I'll teach you
to emulate my sloppiness!

06:07.085 --> 06:08.219
Okay, guys.

06:08.253 --> 06:09.653
Time for you to go
to your mother's.

06:13.058 --> 06:14.592
Here's your mom's house.

06:16.261 --> 06:17.462
Hi, Jerry.

06:17.496 --> 06:18.776
Hey, Bart.
Great to see you, man.

06:18.797 --> 06:19.897
How are you?

06:19.932 --> 06:21.966
Great. Great.
So, I guess you and Jenda

06:22.000 --> 06:23.401
are still together?
Is she there?

06:23.435 --> 06:25.903
Oh, yeah. She's just
getting out of the shower.

06:28.607 --> 06:29.907
Hey, you're looking good, man.

06:29.942 --> 06:31.309
You been working out or what?
No.

06:31.343 --> 06:32.743
You're lucky, man.

06:32.778 --> 06:34.378
I have to hit the gym
like every day,

06:34.413 --> 06:36.214
or I'm like...

06:36.248 --> 06:37.882
Hey, baby.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.150
Hurry, boys.

06:39.184 --> 06:40.318
We're going camping
this weekend.

06:40.352 --> 06:42.420
But <i>our</i> thing was camping.

06:42.454 --> 06:45.056
Living out of a car
is not "camping."

06:45.090 --> 06:47.225
That's right, babe.

06:48.427 --> 06:49.794
Bye.
Good-bye, Daddy!

06:50.829 --> 06:52.563
Take care, Bart.

06:52.598 --> 06:53.865
Hey. Check's due
on the first,

06:53.899 --> 06:55.766
whether it's a
weekend or not.

06:57.703 --> 07:01.105
Dad, if I ever needed
fatherly wisdom, it's now.

07:06.812 --> 07:08.346
Okay, everyone.

07:08.380 --> 07:11.582
Jolly did a great job
standing on her hind legs.

07:11.617 --> 07:12.984
What does she get?

07:13.018 --> 07:15.052
A goat!

07:22.461 --> 07:25.763
Cheer up, Bart.
You're working with dinosaurs.

07:25.797 --> 07:27.598
I miss my kids.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.867
Come on.
You're free and sleazy.

07:29.902 --> 07:32.503
I know some adult dancers
that work with my mom.

07:32.538 --> 07:34.205
Isn't your mom 87?

07:34.239 --> 07:36.207
With social security
a thing of the past,

07:36.241 --> 07:38.009
she can't afford to retire.

07:38.043 --> 07:41.379
I don't know how that happened
in a senate with 99 Democrats.

07:41.413 --> 07:44.482
That one Republican
is great at getting his way.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.821
Brains.

07:50.856 --> 07:51.856
Actually, Terrance,

07:51.890 --> 07:53.391
this is a synthetic
substance.

07:53.425 --> 07:55.393
Devised for zombie vegans.

07:55.427 --> 07:56.494
Or "zegans."

07:56.528 --> 07:58.296
Meh.

07:59.331 --> 08:01.465
What are you doing here?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.167
You weren't answering
your phone.

08:03.201 --> 08:05.870
I was worried you
might have been bitten.

08:05.904 --> 08:09.073
Oh. Zombies not able
to control selves.

08:09.107 --> 08:11.342
All we do bite, bite, bite.

08:11.376 --> 08:12.977
You, sir, am racist.

08:13.011 --> 08:15.012
I'm sure you're one
of the good ones.

08:15.047 --> 08:17.648
Not to imply that there are
any bad ones, of course,

08:17.683 --> 08:20.051
but all stereotypes
come from a place of...

08:20.085 --> 08:21.819
Ow!

08:21.853 --> 08:24.055
Still meh.

08:27.259 --> 08:29.427
I don't think
I'm ready for this, man.

08:29.461 --> 08:32.496
Dude, it's been two years
since the divorce.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.432
Ooh. I love your perfume.

08:34.466 --> 08:35.900
Can I smell you later?

08:35.933 --> 08:37.868
Why don't you smell me now?

08:37.903 --> 08:40.905
Haw haw.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.506
Well, that didn't
look so hard.

08:42.541 --> 08:43.941
You know, at my job,

08:43.976 --> 08:46.777
I satisfy ladies
even bigger than you.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.580
Um, I feed dinosaurs.

08:49.615 --> 08:51.182
Sir, you have to leave.

08:51.216 --> 08:52.617
You're bumming out
everybody,

08:52.651 --> 08:55.319
and you have, like,
a goat beard stuck to your shoe.

08:55.354 --> 08:56.587
Huh?

09:00.125 --> 09:02.093
One, please.

09:11.536 --> 09:13.471
Mm-hmm.

09:14.773 --> 09:16.040
Huh?

09:16.074 --> 09:18.743
Man, that's some
targeted advertising.

09:22.147 --> 09:23.648
After this procedure,

09:23.682 --> 09:25.650
you will have total closure
from your divorce.

09:25.684 --> 09:27.084
How long does this take?

09:27.119 --> 09:29.220
It'll be over before
I finish this...

09:30.288 --> 09:31.255
...sentence.

09:31.289 --> 09:32.990
Wow. It works.

09:33.025 --> 09:35.259
I'm completely over
my ex-wife.

09:35.293 --> 09:36.927
Do you take
wedding bands as tips?

09:36.962 --> 09:38.696
Put it in the jar.

09:39.295 --> 09:41.562
One more injection
in two weeks, and you're cured.

09:42.288 --> 09:43.521
But until then,

09:43.556 --> 09:44.990
you may experience some
zombie-ism.

09:47.059 --> 09:49.160
Brains.

09:49.195 --> 09:50.862
No. Those are just
teaching brains.

09:50.896 --> 09:52.230
They're like
the plastic sushi

09:52.264 --> 09:53.598
in front of a
Japanese restaurant.

09:53.632 --> 09:56.034
Window sushi fake?

09:56.068 --> 09:57.936
Window sushi fake.

10:00.906 --> 10:03.408
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>
I have moved on.

10:03.442 --> 10:05.410
Hey, passable-looking.

10:05.444 --> 10:07.779
Sorry. I'm just a
little creeped out

10:07.813 --> 10:08.880
by that screen saver.

10:08.914 --> 10:10.281
Nothing to worry about.

10:10.316 --> 10:12.183
He's been frozen
like that for days.

10:18.591 --> 10:20.792
♪ Girls

10:20.826 --> 10:23.061
♪ All I really want is girls

10:23.095 --> 10:25.296
♪ And in the morning
it's girls... ♪

10:25.331 --> 10:28.466
Wow. Now I see why
they call you Miss Hoover.

10:28.501 --> 10:30.435
You must have been
vacuuming for an hour.

10:30.469 --> 10:32.470
Anything to please my man.

10:32.505 --> 10:34.472
So, was it good for you?

10:34.507 --> 10:37.475
"Good" is not a concept
in my culture!

10:38.878 --> 10:40.879
Oh, my God.
We went home with you?

10:40.913 --> 10:42.580
Not just me.

10:42.615 --> 10:45.250
There's Beppo, Boppo,
Emmett Kelly the Ninth,

10:45.284 --> 10:48.386
Frenchy, Insane Clown Polly
and Commodore Tee-hee.

10:51.157 --> 10:53.958
Brains? Brains?

10:53.993 --> 10:55.260
Garden brains.

10:57.129 --> 10:59.564
Spicy Mexican garden brains?

10:59.598 --> 11:02.567
Too much sodium.

11:02.601 --> 11:04.569
Give me your wallet!

11:07.106 --> 11:09.107
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

11:09.141 --> 11:11.443
What seems to be
the oopsie here?

11:13.446 --> 11:15.947
Yay! I'm fighting crime!

11:16.916 --> 11:19.417
Officer needs backup.

11:19.452 --> 11:21.286
There, back up.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.254
Oh?

11:23.289 --> 11:27.058
The old Milhouse would have been
helpless with an asthma attack.

11:27.093 --> 11:29.661
No breathing, no asthma.

11:29.695 --> 11:32.664
I love how you're dropping
all your definite articles.

11:32.698 --> 11:34.532
Brevity soul wit.

11:35.568 --> 11:37.168
Uh, what are you cooking?

11:37.203 --> 11:39.204
Nothing.

11:40.439 --> 11:42.340
You know,
Dad really misses you.

11:42.374 --> 11:44.776
Well, I don't
miss his nonsense.

11:44.810 --> 11:46.911
There's a lot of stuff
he blamed on raccoons

11:46.946 --> 11:49.414
that I'm starting
to suspect was him.

11:49.448 --> 11:51.049
Look, maybe I shouldn't
have done this,

11:51.083 --> 11:53.418
but I've got him right here.

11:53.452 --> 11:55.086
Oh.

11:57.756 --> 11:59.791
Sorry, I must have
recorded over Dad.

11:59.825 --> 12:02.794
But admit it. When you thought
it was Dad, you were excited.

12:02.828 --> 12:06.531
It's only natural to miss a man
you buried 127 times.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.913
Hey, Homer, your robot
body finally came.

12:21.947 --> 12:23.381
About time!

12:25.651 --> 12:27.185
Huh. Huh.

12:27.219 --> 12:28.386
Hmm?

12:28.420 --> 12:30.655
Hey, where's my junk?

12:30.689 --> 12:32.390
Oh.

12:32.424 --> 12:33.658
Whew!

12:34.927 --> 12:36.661
Hello?

12:38.364 --> 12:40.532
Oh, you boys
look happy.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.400
Yeah, but
Mom's sad.

12:42.434 --> 12:43.902
Jerry moved out.

12:45.004 --> 12:46.437
I thought he was the one, Bart.

12:46.472 --> 12:48.072
I just put in a
saltwater tank

12:48.107 --> 12:49.941
where he could shed
his exoskeleton.

12:49.975 --> 12:53.011
And now when I walk by
it, I feel like a fool.

12:53.045 --> 12:54.913
He's the fool.
You're great.

12:54.947 --> 12:57.215
You're just saying that
because you have to.

12:57.249 --> 12:58.683
I don't have
to say anything.

12:58.717 --> 12:59.884
Believe me, no guy wants

12:59.919 --> 13:02.187
to see his ex
looking hot or being sweet.

13:02.221 --> 13:04.055
Makes him realize
everything he's lost.

13:04.089 --> 13:06.858
Wow. Wow.
You've really grown.

13:06.892 --> 13:08.326
We should have
dinner sometime.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.994
Hey, Dad, can you
watch the boys?

13:10.029 --> 13:12.530
Sure.

13:15.467 --> 13:17.468
Body, to Moe's.

13:19.838 --> 13:23.041
Hey, you're kind of
quiet tonight, Homer.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.893
You know, this was
a great evening.

13:41.927 --> 13:43.895
Please enjoy your desserts.

13:43.929 --> 13:46.130
Man, when is that voice
gonna change?

13:52.404 --> 13:54.639
Suddenly,
I want a different dessert.

13:54.673 --> 13:56.374
But they brought us
little cakes and...

13:56.408 --> 13:57.709
Oh.

13:57.743 --> 13:59.177
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

14:02.137 --> 14:04.405
Oop, oop, uh, yeah, open
your stance a little there.

14:04.439 --> 14:06.407
Oh! Yeah, that's it.

14:06.441 --> 14:08.442
Do your worst, kids!

14:11.046 --> 14:12.413
Come on!

14:12.447 --> 14:14.748
Hug your grandpa, boys!

14:16.051 --> 14:18.786
Threat perceived.
Terminate! Terminate!

14:21.790 --> 14:24.291
Kids are so afraid
of being terminated.

14:24.326 --> 14:26.594
Looking good,
Santa's Little Hybrid.

14:26.628 --> 14:29.029
Father, what am I?

14:29.064 --> 14:30.364
<i>Guys,</i>

14:30.398 --> 14:31.532
sit down.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.367
Our lives are gonna change
a little.

14:33.401 --> 14:35.436
Uh-oh.
This is never good.

14:35.470 --> 14:36.804
This <i>is</i> good.

14:36.838 --> 14:38.958
Your father and I are gonna try
to make it work again.

14:38.974 --> 14:40.274
Like a classic rock band

14:40.308 --> 14:42.543
whose hold-out member
finally needs money.

14:42.577 --> 14:46.380
Wow. Everyone's back together
except Gramma and Grampa.

14:46.414 --> 14:48.749
Oh, I think
that's about to change.

14:52.887 --> 14:54.955
Aren't you going
to work, Dad?

14:54.990 --> 14:57.024
One of us has to stay home
with you guys.

14:57.058 --> 14:58.892
And your mom can't quit her job
at Google.

14:58.927 --> 15:01.128
They need my help hunting down
those self-driving cars

15:01.162 --> 15:02.262
that turned evil.

15:02.297 --> 15:04.898
Oh, you passed
another rest stop!

15:04.933 --> 15:07.001
I am not stopping again.

15:07.035 --> 15:09.837
But I had a large soda!

15:09.871 --> 15:11.639
I said get the small!

15:11.673 --> 15:13.474
It was only 50 cents more!

15:13.508 --> 15:15.142
Let's play The Quiet Game!

15:16.444 --> 15:19.380
Now, will somebody hold up
a one dollar bill?

15:25.086 --> 15:28.956
Uh-oh. It looks like we woke
someone up from her nap.

15:31.259 --> 15:34.261
Well, now that you're up,
you can do your juggling act.

15:41.469 --> 15:43.771
Milhouse, you were supposed
to come see me today

15:43.805 --> 15:46.106
for your final
anti-zombie injection.

15:46.141 --> 15:48.609
Yes, well, uh...

15:48.643 --> 15:50.644
But I'm supposed
to be in surgery now,

15:50.679 --> 15:53.280
so I guess we're both
playing hooky.

15:53.314 --> 15:56.283
But, Lisa, if you want Milhouse
to return to his old self,

15:56.317 --> 15:58.437
then you'd better bring him in
for that shot tomorrow.

15:58.453 --> 15:59.987
But, Doctor...

16:00.021 --> 16:02.322
he's so much more
interesting this way.

16:03.958 --> 16:06.794
Ooh.
I see.

16:06.828 --> 16:10.564
Now enjoy the majesty
of our prehistoric past.

16:15.503 --> 16:17.805
So, that earring I
lost in the teleport,

16:17.839 --> 16:19.339
turns out it's in Florida.

16:19.374 --> 16:20.607
Yes!

16:20.642 --> 16:22.543
That's not a
listening-to-me "yes."

16:22.577 --> 16:23.711
You're watching something.

16:23.745 --> 16:26.046
What? Me?
Oh, that's crazy.

16:26.081 --> 16:27.548
You know, I knew it.

16:27.582 --> 16:30.284
This is supposed to be us time,
and you're lensing a game.

16:30.318 --> 16:32.486
Well, you're not
paying attention to me.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.055
You're texting.

16:35.090 --> 16:38.726
Yeah, only to complain about you
not paying any attention to me.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.594
If I wasn't paying attention,

16:40.628 --> 16:42.863
then how did I notice
you not paying attention

16:42.897 --> 16:45.399
to my not paying attention? Ha!

16:45.433 --> 16:48.168
Oh, I thought this time
things were gonna be different.

16:48.203 --> 16:49.403
They are.

16:49.437 --> 16:50.604
You're four years older.

16:50.638 --> 16:53.173
Wow. What does
<i>that</i> mean?

16:53.208 --> 16:55.843
Uh...

16:58.213 --> 16:59.880
Hey, Bart,
what'll it be?

16:59.914 --> 17:02.583
A tall beer and no
judgmental women.

17:02.617 --> 17:04.818
That is so
typical of you.

17:04.853 --> 17:06.353
What are you doing here?

17:06.387 --> 17:08.387
I have to decide whether
to make Milhouse...

17:09.590 --> 17:10.858
...human again.

17:10.892 --> 17:12.960
I even prefer
the way he smells now.

17:12.993 --> 17:15.395
Some meat went
bad in our freezer,

17:15.430 --> 17:18.165
and my heart
skipped a beat.

17:18.199 --> 17:22.269
Phoo! You two don't know
what a rough marriage is.

17:22.303 --> 17:23.971
Mom, I got to know.

17:24.005 --> 17:26.673
Once and for all,
what is the secret?

17:26.708 --> 17:29.376
Why did you stay
with Dad so long?

17:29.410 --> 17:31.879
Until I was eight, I thought
he was a magical gorilla.

17:31.913 --> 17:34.581
Look, life's tough.

17:34.616 --> 17:36.517
It's hard to make it through.

17:36.551 --> 17:39.319
The only way I know is
when you make a decision

17:39.354 --> 17:41.989
that comes from your
heart, you stick with it.

17:43.224 --> 17:44.458
Like my marriage.

17:44.492 --> 17:46.059
Or my divorce.

17:46.094 --> 17:49.062
Or my decision to support
Duffman in his old age.

17:49.097 --> 17:51.331
Duffman can still
swing and party.

17:51.366 --> 17:53.400
Oh, yeah.

17:55.837 --> 17:57.371
Wait, Mom.

17:57.405 --> 17:59.873
Does that mean you're
going to take Dad back?

17:59.908 --> 18:02.743
No, I'm going
to join him forever.

18:11.119 --> 18:13.120
Oh.

18:16.524 --> 18:19.326
I can't tell
if that was love, suicide

18:19.360 --> 18:21.595
or a... a really boring
video game.

18:21.629 --> 18:25.465
Lisa, your husband
is... fine.

18:26.668 --> 18:28.168
No residual
zombie-ism whatsoever.

18:28.203 --> 18:29.570
Are you sure?

18:29.604 --> 18:32.506
Watch. I'll just wave this
juicy brain in front of him.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.508
I'm gonna faint!

18:34.542 --> 18:35.976
Hooray.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.245
So, Jenda,
I don't know what love is,

18:38.279 --> 18:40.681
but I know what it isn't,
and we're <i>isn't.</i>

18:40.715 --> 18:41.915
Yeah.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.383
You're right.

18:43.418 --> 18:45.686
That's why I started seeing
Jerry again without telling you.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.087
Hey, buddy, how,
uh, how you doing?

18:47.121 --> 18:48.655
What?! Oh!

18:48.690 --> 18:49.890
You know what, Jenda?

18:49.924 --> 18:51.091
I'm not even mad,

18:51.125 --> 18:53.393
because I'm finally,
completely over you.

18:54.963 --> 18:57.397
...sentence.

18:57.432 --> 18:59.733
Wait. What am I doing back here?

18:59.767 --> 19:00.934
You never left.

19:00.969 --> 19:02.069
Everything that
you experienced

19:02.103 --> 19:03.904
between when I flipped
the switch and now

19:03.938 --> 19:05.939
was just a neural implant
in your temporal lobe.

19:05.974 --> 19:09.443
Uh, you should look
at my profile.

19:09.477 --> 19:11.345
Oh. Uh-huh.

19:11.379 --> 19:15.282
It was all a dream,
and now you can go home.

19:15.316 --> 19:16.516
So, you're sure I'm cured?

19:16.551 --> 19:18.185
No more feelings for my ex-wife?

19:18.219 --> 19:19.386
I'm positive.

19:19.420 --> 19:21.221
We treat a lot of
people for obsessions.

19:22.457 --> 19:25.459
It's a whole new day
for Nothing Stu!

19:26.494 --> 19:28.161
Wow. I'm free.

19:28.196 --> 19:29.663
Get ready, world.

19:29.697 --> 19:31.999
I've got a whole new set
of mistakes to make.

19:33.735 --> 19:36.303
Uh, ol' Gil could
use a fresh start.

19:36.337 --> 19:38.005
Weren't you just
in here this morning?

19:38.039 --> 19:40.040
I've had a bad day.

19:43.455 --> 19:46.057
After 35 years
of marriage,

19:46.091 --> 19:48.059
we've finally
gotten it right.

19:48.093 --> 19:50.695
Yes, even my personality
has gotten,

19:50.729 --> 19:54.298
shall we say,
an upgrade.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.868
Oh! That's a bit
of a whoo-hoo.

19:56.902 --> 19:59.403
Indeed.
Lis,

19:59.438 --> 20:01.472
I hope things work out
with you and Milhouse,

20:01.506 --> 20:03.774
but if they don't, I know
just where you should go.

20:03.809 --> 20:05.276
Thanks, but Milhouse
and I are in

20:05.310 --> 20:06.577
a pretty good place.

20:06.612 --> 20:08.646
Even though he's not
a zombie anymore?

20:08.680 --> 20:12.083
No, that's what happened
in your false memories.

20:12.117 --> 20:13.942
There is no cure
for zombie-ism.

20:14.519 --> 20:18.656
Dead flower
from dead husband.

20:21.326 --> 20:23.694
And I was a false memory, too.

20:23.729 --> 20:25.096
No, you were real.

20:25.130 --> 20:26.864
Aw, shucks.

20:35.240 --> 20:39.010
<i>Next week on Fox Television's</i>
The Simpsons:

20:39.044 --> 20:40.177
Sit down.

20:40.212 --> 20:41.445
You're not going anywhere.

20:43.849 --> 20:45.383
