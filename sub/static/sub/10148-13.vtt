01:07.151 --> 01:09.779
<i>As Batman, you must handle
the Widely varied tactics</i>

01:09.862 --> 01:11.022
<i>of your criminal adversaries.</i>

01:14.784 --> 01:16.803
<i>Some will try to distract you
with bizarre gimmicks.</i>

01:16.827 --> 01:17.912
Ah-ha!

01:23.501 --> 01:25.211
<i>Learn to use
their weapons against them.</i>

01:34.595 --> 01:35.805
<i>These quirks have a pattern.</i>

01:36.180 --> 01:37.890
<i>Recognizing them is the key to winning.</i>

02:02.873 --> 02:04.041
Not too shabby, huh?

02:13.384 --> 02:14.218
Better.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.263
Though your execution
could use more finesse.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.266
Hey, it gets the job done.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.767
Speaking ofjobs,

02:22.184 --> 02:24.645
yours is to get a replacement
for this one after school.

02:30.109 --> 02:33.070
So I tell this chick,
"Sure, I'll call... When I'm desperate."

02:33.154 --> 02:34.447
Nelson.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.615
Howard.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.786
Hope you didn't break your hand.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.038
What do you want?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.914
Big party at my place this weekend.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.166
Parents are out of town.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.168
And, hey, it's gonna be wild.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.586
See you guys there, right?

02:48.878 --> 02:50.296
Doubtful.

02:51.714 --> 02:53.841
Great. Cool. Friday night.

02:56.802 --> 03:00.723
So I tell this guy, "Sure,
we can date... When I'm desperate."

03:01.974 --> 03:04.435
Yo, Blade, Chelsea.

03:04.935 --> 03:08.356
I guess I'll be seeing you ladies
at my schway party this Friday.

03:09.106 --> 03:09.940
A party?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.442
Who else is going?

03:12.276 --> 03:14.278
Well, I just spoke to Nelson

03:14.362 --> 03:18.366
and, uh, some other guys
and, you know, a lot of other kids.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.306
Their names escape me at the moment.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.872
Super. See you there.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.584
Social meltdown.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.127
It's too painful to watch.

03:31.337 --> 03:34.882
Hey, guys. I think we're looking
at a packed house on Friday.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.927
Relax, Howard.
Forget the A-list. It's degrading.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.638
Only politicians chase after people
who don't like them.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.890
Terry, Max, and I
are definitely going to be there.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.267
Think of it as quality over quantity.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.477
Gotta run.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.229
Small, intimate party might be fun.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.488
I appreciate
what you guys were saying,

03:58.072 --> 04:01.659
but I still want a cool girlfriend
like Chelsea or Blade.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.577
Then kids would come to me.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.788
It's a sign that you're somebody.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.415
Somebody pretty shallow.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.208
Shallow but popular.

04:11.836 --> 04:14.338
Hey, the boss' car.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.005
How about a lift?

04:16.132 --> 04:17.572
Sure, if you don't mind a side trip.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.111
I have to run an errand for Mr. Wayne.

04:19.135 --> 04:21.303
Oh, if I had wheels like these,

04:21.637 --> 04:23.264
I'd get more girls than a rock star.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.558
I did mention the whole shallow thing,
didn't I?

04:37.653 --> 04:40.072
Yes, Mr. Wayne's special order is ready.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.576
He, uh, certainly goes through
a lot of these synthoids.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.828
You know old folks.
Always breaking stuff.

04:46.162 --> 04:49.290
You'll have to sign
federal clearance form S-29Y.

04:49.707 --> 04:50.541
It's a new one.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.024
Paperwork makes the world go round.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.460
I'll be right back.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.674
This place is great.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.680
Skip? Louie.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.766
You can stop worrying
about those lonely weekends.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.727
Your custom order's ready.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.229
Thought you'd be.

05:12.688 --> 05:13.688
Everything you wanted.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.152
Blonde, dimples, the works.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.446
Oh, brunette?

05:20.529 --> 05:22.114
My mistake.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.531
Delivery's tonight.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.741
Behave yourself.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.995
Hey, drifty, you got a purpose?

05:28.287 --> 05:29.830
I'm here to pick up a special order.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.333
Ah, you want a custom job.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.911
Something like that
little synthoid number over there?

05:35.336 --> 05:36.712
Sure, sure, yeah.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.380
Uh, I mean, can you?

05:39.423 --> 05:40.423
Well, legally, no.

05:43.219 --> 05:45.262
But for the right price,
I'd shave a coyote.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.807
Will this be enough?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.060
Oh, yeah.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.605
Tell me what you want,
and I'll make it happen.

05:55.231 --> 05:58.442
Personality-wise,
she's gotta be completely devoted to me.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.486
One hundred percent loyal.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.781
Physically, around five-seven,

06:04.156 --> 06:05.991
red hair, medium length,

06:06.575 --> 06:09.453
and the coolest green eyes.

06:21.674 --> 06:22.925
Whoo-hoo!

06:23.008 --> 06:24.885
Mmm-mmm.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.596
- What's your name, doll?
- I don't know.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.640
First-day jitters, huh?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.891
Hill High can be friendly

06:31.267 --> 06:32.601
if you've got the right friends.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.143
No, thanks.

06:34.478 --> 06:35.813
I'm only interested in him.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.734
Excuse me, Nelson.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.445
She's out of your league.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.281
Your friend got a name, Groote?

06:45.990 --> 06:47.950
Cynthia.

06:48.993 --> 06:49.993
Gotta run.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.540
No way a nimbus like Groote
deserves a schway babe like that.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.767
I'm gonna have to put him in his place.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.175
You in here, Groote?

07:06.719 --> 07:09.138
Come on out, Howie. I wanna talk to you.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.137
Nelson's pretty banged up.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.351
Good thing he was still wearing
his hockey pads.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.036
Otherwise, he might have been killed.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.434
How weird.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.686
I mean, lockers don't just fall over.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.187
Why dwell on it?

07:59.396 --> 08:02.441
Besides, Nelson didn't seem
like a very nice guy to begin with.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.451
- Brr.
- That girl's subarctic.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.925
Are you nuts?
This is the boys' locker room.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.843
Yeah, I can smell the mildew.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.302
What's up?

08:34.306 --> 08:35.306
Check this out.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.016
Hand prints?

08:37.643 --> 08:39.563
They don't look big enough
to knock over lockers.

08:39.812 --> 08:40.896
No fingerprints, either.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.023
Maybe he wore gloves or something.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.746
Terry,
you gotta get me out of here.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.790
- How?
- I don't know.

08:59.873 --> 09:00.873
Think of something.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.960
I'll let Mr. Silverstein know
you'll be late.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.003
You are so dead, McGinnis.

09:14.263 --> 09:17.850
Like I was saying, kickoff time
for the party of the century.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.602
My party is 8:00 pm. tonight.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.771
When it ends is up to you.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.819
If you're not too busy being Mr. Host,

09:29.194 --> 09:32.239
maybe I can pry you away
from Cynthia for a dance.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.616
You're talking to Howard Groote.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.160
All things are possible.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.371
My notebook.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.834
I'm very sorry, Howard.
You know I didn't mean to.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.919
I would never do anything to upset you.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.380
That's okay. It happens.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.477
They don't make plastics
like they used to.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.842
See you tonight, Howie.

10:21.789 --> 10:22.789
Nice view, huh?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.250
You wouldn't be the jealous type,
would you, Cynthia?

10:28.045 --> 10:29.045
Excuse me.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.653
I've known Howard for quite a while.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.175
- How long have you known him?
- All my life.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.178
Come on, Cynthia, who are you?
Where do you come from?

10:36.261 --> 10:37.861
What's the real deal
with you and Howard?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.723
I'm very devoted to Howard.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.850
One hundred percent loyal.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.038
No way.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.126
- A synthoid?
- Looks that way.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.921
I didn't know they made androids
that could double for people.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.296
They're not supposed to.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.150
<i>I'm gonna have to check it out.</i>

11:14.174 --> 11:16.374
When you get to the party,
keep an eye on Cynthia, okay?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.262
Oh, and let Dana know
I'll be a little late.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.472
You live dangerously, McGinnis.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.494
So I said...

11:44.121 --> 11:46.290
Yes, Mr. Drago,
that's no problem.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.750
All six can look like keno girls.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.253
Uh-huh, we're very discreet.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.067
- [But I'm a big blabbermouth.
498898]

11:55.507 --> 11:57.384
Your little sideline's over, pal.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.598
You oughta look
into getting a synthoid, Batfreak.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.766
It'II give you something to do
on Friday night.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.364
Come on, right now!

13:00.656 --> 13:01.531
Let's finish it.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.991
What's the matter, no guts?

13:03.867 --> 13:04.867
Wait a minute.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.877
Hey, hey, hey. You got me.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.456
Can't we work something out?

13:15.754 --> 13:18.554
Maybe I could give you a little tip
or something to forget all of this.

13:18.882 --> 13:19.925
Let me give you a tip.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.596
Get a good lawyer.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.311
Maybe you can walk me home.

13:31.853 --> 13:32.853
We won't have to walk.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.066
That's right, ten goals in one game.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.234
But you lost.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.611
I think it was Martin Buber who said...

13:42.948 --> 13:44.950
Hey, Howard,
we should double date sometime.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.242
I'd be up for that.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.663
Actually, I'd be interested
in single dating you anytime.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.290
I'll try to squeeze you in.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.170
Whoa, Cynthia, come on.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.505
It was nothing.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.173
Take it easy, girl.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.343
That's enough.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.304
You and I are gonna have a little talk.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.808
Hey, Howie, great cheese dingles.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.227
Where are you two going, private party?

14:12.561 --> 14:14.730
Yeah, sure.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.523
I'm going to jail.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.779
Pick up, Louie.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.282
I need a little support service here.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.075
You don't like me anymore.

14:27.576 --> 14:28.576
I do, Cynthia.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.996
I just have to fix something
in your command processor

14:31.079 --> 14:32.748
so you don't shove people around.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.292
But I am
what you wanted me to be, Howard.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.670
I just didn't mean quite so intense.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.088
You're hurting people.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.798
We won't need other people.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.885
You're my only reason for being.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.553
I'd go to pieces without you.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.764
Cynthia. Cynthia.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.433
Keep your hands to your...
Cynthia!

14:51.892 --> 14:52.892
Go, Howard.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.561
We can be together forever.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.980
Forever's a long time.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.732
A real long time.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.233
And I'm kinda young.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.736
Which means we'll have
even more time together.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.279
Cynthia, listen.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.654
We have to talk.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.533
The fact is,
this relationship isn't working.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.202
You're way too possessive.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.246
It was great in the beginning
but now, I...

15:13.663 --> 15:14.663
You what?

15:15.916 --> 15:17.250
I wanna see other girls.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.505
Oh, this isn't good.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.592
Sounds like you really got her wound up.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.135
You don't know the half of it.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.355
- [This chick was... Hey.
198893]

15:38.438 --> 15:39.438
Okay, that's it.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.482
- No more nachos.
{933931

15:42.025 --> 15:44.236
Party's over. Get out. Bye.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.159
- What's going on, man?
- Party's just started.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.325
Howard, you can't do this to me.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.038
Cynthia, please.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.171
<i>Okay, robe-Mm, round two.</i>

16:16.810 --> 16:17.811
Down, girlfriend.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.988
Uh, hope I wasn't out of line
with that "robo-bim" crack.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.080
{933931

16:48.717 --> 16:50.343
That's one way out of a bad date.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.227
Uh-oh.

17:15.994 --> 17:19.956
It's so schway. Cynthia's a robot
and Batman's kicking her butt.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.966
Cynthia, can't we work something out?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.968
Just because I wanna date others

18:13.051 --> 18:15.220
doesn't mean
we can't occasionally see each other.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.722
Howard, don't you understand?

18:18.181 --> 18:19.599
I was created for you.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.977
I know, but people change.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.812
Synthoids get reprogrammed.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.105
These things happen.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.274
We can still be friends.

18:29.985 --> 18:30.986
"Friends"?

18:31.695 --> 18:33.822
"Friends"?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.447
Wrong thing to say?

18:35.782 --> 18:36.992
Is it ever the right thing?

18:41.746 --> 18:42.746
She's gonna blow.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.657
Schway party, Howard.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.452
It takes real guts
to blow up your own home.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.289
Yeah, kids are gonna talk
about this night for years.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.497
You're a legend.

19:38.762 --> 19:42.098
Yo, Chelsea, I saved that dance for you.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.684
- Oh!
- Get a life, toy-boy.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.483
Whoa! What the heck happened?

19:51.983 --> 19:53.026
The party peaked early.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.072
Just look at it.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.990
How could this be any worse?

20:01.284 --> 20:02.410
Howard!

20:06.164 --> 20:07.164
See ya.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.959
Mom, Dad.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.712
I thought you had another week
in Madrid.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.049
We did until you maxed out
our credit card.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.302
What in blazes did you buy with it?
Dynamite?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.888
Dynamite to blow up the house with?

20:22.347 --> 20:25.892
I think Howard needs some quality time
alone with his folks.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.394
You think they'll ground him?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.120
Your mother's
antique doll collection...
