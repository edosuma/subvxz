00:17.200 --> 00:18.560
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:22.520
The foreman found a human foot
in the foundation yesterday morning.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.080
They found a body whose clothes
make an unambiguous attribution possible.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.840
The man must have been a priest.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.960
-Has he been identified?
-Saint Josef.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.440
A little souvenir
of your exciting time in the capital.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.520
I was asked to hand this in
for Chief Inspector Böhm.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.600
-Never flown before?
-No.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.520
-No.
-It's the first flight for these men.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.960
Go on, then.

00:57.960 --> 01:02.360
These documents are proof
of a German base in the Soviet Union,

01:02.440 --> 01:06.120
where German pilots are trained to become
fighter pilots by German experts.

01:06.640 --> 01:11.320
We have reliable information that certain
circles are planning to assassinate you.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.520
-Communists?
-National forces.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.080
Mr. Benda is not a murderer. Is he nice to you, yeah?

01:16.720 --> 01:19.080
No, but he has a good heart. I know that.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.120
Gretchen, that may be so. But he's
also the chief of the political police.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.720
-You didn't tell me you have a son.
-Moritz isn't my son.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.400
-I see.
-No, he's my nephew.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.360
Make yourselves at home.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.640
Charlotte.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.640
He's asking if you need a bed.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.280
-Well, if that's possible...
-No problem.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.840
Stop!

03:48.880 --> 03:49.800
Stop!

03:50.760 --> 03:51.600
Stop!

05:22.320 --> 05:26.000
She says, she really wants
to become a detective.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.600
Are women even allowed to do that?

05:28.680 --> 05:29.960
Why not?

05:39.920 --> 05:42.480
It's making me nervous
when you look over my shoulder.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.080
I like her.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.480
Who?

05:50.560 --> 05:51.600
The girl.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.080
She would be right for our boy.
She'd wake him up.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.520
Well, let's go, there's no one in.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.880
Always the hammering. They are deaf,
for goodness sake. You have to press that.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.000
-Here, the light switch?
-Yes.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.840
Their son fixed that for his parents.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.880
Mr. Jänicke?

06:37.680 --> 06:38.600
Hello.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.160
May I come in?

07:01.080 --> 07:01.920
Hello.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.240
-There he is.
-It's him.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.400
Is all this because of us?

07:41.680 --> 07:42.600
What happened?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.400
Gentlemen, thank you.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.080
Chief Inspector Böhm
has visited the crime scene.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.680
Inspector Böhm, your report, please.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.600
To put it briefly,
it was an accurate shot to the head.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.600
Like an execution.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
The Russians?

08:18.840 --> 08:21.640
No, the unusual make of the weapon
points in another direction.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.960
Very rare. Made by Lignose.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.040
Lignose?

08:28.920 --> 08:31.160
Hang on a minute.
We just had one like that.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.240
-The priest.
-Saint Josef.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.600
I had Mr. Ullrich of Ballistics examine
the projectiles immediately.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.840
-And?
-It was the same weapon.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.560
Is that certain?

08:44.080 --> 08:45.320
Same weapon or same make?

08:45.840 --> 08:46.680
The same weapon.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.920
Stefan Jänicke and Josef Wilczek
were shot with this weapon.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.600
There's no doubt.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.560
Those are the two projectiles.
Lignose 6.35.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.160
We've compared the fine lines
scratched into the bullets

09:01.240 --> 09:04.080
by the barrel of this precise weapon.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.720
As you can see, the images are identical.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.800
We use the following method
to check our hypothesis.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.520
We dip the projectiles in ink

09:16.600 --> 09:19.720
and roll them with gentle pressure
on absorbent paper.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.040
-This is Jänicke, this is Wilczek?
-Exactly.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.440
It's the same image.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.440
Gentlemen.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.240
There is something else which is odd.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.840
Both victims died
when they were on their way to see you...

09:40.200 --> 09:42.640
or had already seen you, Mr. Rath.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.720
-I beg your pardon?
-Jänicke was found by your nephew.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.040
Around the corner from your new residence.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.600
-Why wasn't I told about this?
-You could not be reached.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.800
As we all know,
you're on a secret mission.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.880
But you remember your encounter
with Father Wilczek?

10:04.160 --> 10:05.240
What are you talking about?

10:05.680 --> 10:08.680
You were the last person
to see the murdered priest alive.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.120
-When was this supposed to have been?
-Last Thursday.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.600
-I have never seen that man.
-That's not true.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.600
You were spotted, together with Wolter
and the holy smoke.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.800
Stop that nonsense.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.480
-Is this an interrogation?
-Enough.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.560
-I'm just asking question.
-Chief Inspector.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.720
Please continue in a constructive way.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.280
Why does the guy from Cologne run straight
to the body as soon as it's in Forensics

10:31.360 --> 10:34.280
-and grabs the evidence?
-Now hang on a minute!

10:34.360 --> 10:36.680
Jänicke's body hasn't been autopsied yet.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.560
The other day,
I'm talking about the priest's body.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.000
Is that true, Mr. Rath?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.960
I just wanted to help out, that is all.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.600
If we don't keep order, not even as far
as our responsibilities are concerned,

10:53.680 --> 10:56.840
we're nothing
but a pathetic bunch of slobs!

10:59.040 --> 11:00.800
Not a homicide squad.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.720
This way, we won't even find
the murderers of our colleagues.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.560
And, Chief Inspector,

11:07.160 --> 11:10.880
fate doesn't usually tend to put the
perpetrator straight in front of us.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.720
Least of all at police headquarters.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.880
-Has the family been told?
-I went there today.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.160
By tomorrow morning...

11:21.840 --> 11:23.560
a detailed report. Crime scene analysis,

11:25.640 --> 11:26.800
witness checks.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.440
Reconstruct each and every step
Stefan Jänicke took

11:31.520 --> 11:33.040
until his murder.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.280
This case is our highest priority.
Gentlemen, let's go back to work.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.040
Thank you, Chief Inspector Böhm.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.040
<i>Alright.</i>

12:07.360 --> 12:09.160
Stefan Jänicke was a mole.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.160
Who was he working for?

12:13.840 --> 12:14.680
For me.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.000
What or whom was he investigating?

12:20.760 --> 12:24.240
There is an event,
an operation called <i>Prangertag.</i>

12:25.320 --> 12:27.640
-What's behind the name?
-An assassination plan.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.080
We don't know the details yet.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.040
The French foreign minister
has been in town since Thursday.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.880
It is my responsibility
to guarantee for his safety.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.200
-Stefan Jänicke had a notebook.
-What about it?

12:43.280 --> 12:45.640
He was urgently trying
to contact me before he died.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.360
We have to find his notes.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.560
-The book was not on him?
-No.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.680
When do we get the pictures from Lipetsk?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.520
Gräf is already in the lab.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.440
It's my fault.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.080
Please.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.160
Stefan was here because of me.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.280
With us, the squad.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.160
No, that's not true.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.160
It's the other way around, in fact.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.920
You are here because of him.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
Can I help you?

15:19.320 --> 15:20.880
I'm looking for his notebook.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.040
-The red one?
-Yes.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.960
He always carried that with him.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.840
It wasn't on his body. Who killed Stefan?

15:38.520 --> 15:39.360
The Russians?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.080
But who did it then?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.320
Jänicke was exposed,

15:54.400 --> 15:55.560
as an informer.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.600
-What?
-An internal one.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.560
Who was his target?

16:06.640 --> 16:07.600
I don't know.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.680
But you suspect someone?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.520
Who was he working for?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.320
That...

16:23.240 --> 16:25.680
That's not true, I don't believe that.
Why...

16:26.240 --> 16:28.160
-Why would Wolter...
-I don't know.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.000
We need his notebook.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.640
Very well.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.280
NO TRESPASSING

16:49.360 --> 16:50.840
-Evening.
-Evening.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.800
NO TRESPASSING

18:19.320 --> 18:20.640
We searched the lot.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.200
There was no notebook.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.120
Nowhere.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.480
-Gereon!
-Quiet.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.800
Get Moritz and pack your things.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.400
-What?
-We need to leave.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.640
Pack up, right away.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.200
But why? Go on now.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.280
Go on!

19:08.480 --> 19:09.400
Quiet!

19:19.440 --> 19:20.600
Gereon.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.840
The police officer I found...

19:33.360 --> 19:34.800
did he live around there?

19:35.840 --> 19:36.840
No, he didn't.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.280
Did he want to see the Chief Inspector?

19:45.320 --> 19:46.200
No.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.480
He wanted to see me. Are you sure?

19:56.880 --> 19:57.720
Yes.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.920
Keep the change.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.160
Night, Moritz. That way.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.280
Sorry, doll. Couldn't make it any sooner.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.640
-When are the masters back?
-In about two hours.

21:04.840 --> 21:05.800
Take your shoes off.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.480
-Bullshit.
-Not so loud, the kids are sleeping.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.400
Come on in. This way.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.240
Come. This way.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.360
Fritz, where are you going?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.080
-Where are they sleeping?
-Upstairs.

21:56.960 --> 21:57.800
I'll...

22:01.960 --> 22:04.840
-What's in there?
-The dining room.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.680
Fritz, please,
we mustn't go through there.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.520
Are you nuts?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.800
That's the old man's study.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.080
-Come.
-No. That's enough.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.520
-Come.
-No. Enough.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.560
Come.

23:15.960 --> 23:16.800
Come here.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.560
Since when have you been smoking?

24:19.800 --> 24:20.640
Since just now.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.120
From what did we flee?

24:27.200 --> 24:28.760
I can't tell you.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.480
You're safe here.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.440
From whom?

24:36.240 --> 24:38.400
Does this have anything to do
with your secret mission?

24:40.920 --> 24:43.200
You were gone. I don't know where.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.040
I was in Russia.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.960
In Russia?

24:52.680 --> 24:54.720
How did you get there so quickly?

24:56.440 --> 24:57.400
In a plane.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.800
You flew on an airplane?

25:02.480 --> 25:03.320
Yes.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.160
What's it like, flying?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.160
Wobbly.

25:25.120 --> 25:25.960
Come to me.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.600
Hear this?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.240
Everything sounds different from home.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.720
I emptied my savings book...

26:07.600 --> 26:09.280
took Moritz out of school.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.800
I left two large suitcases at Margarete's.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.280
Your father has no idea.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.480
If you want, we can make a fresh start,
here in Berlin.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.400
Do you want to? Rudi?

27:33.280 --> 27:36.120
Charlotte. That's nice.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.240
I'm sorry.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.800
I just wanted some sleep,
but it seems I'm interrupting.

27:41.880 --> 27:42.720
Not at all.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.720
This is Erika.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.200
-And this is...
-This is Pille.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.080
Come.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.440
Some other time, yeah?

29:01.920 --> 29:05.040
TODAY'S RECOMMENDATIONS:
SOUP OF THE DAY: PEA SOUP 30

29:05.120 --> 29:09.120
I used to think my mother didn't like me
because I am not like her or Ilse

29:09.200 --> 29:10.560
or like Toni.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.200
It started with my hair.
She didn't want to comb it.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.760
"There's nothing to comb.
Fluff hair," she said.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.400
Too think, too dark,
you saw my sisters, they're all fairer.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.720
Not that it matters.

29:24.440 --> 29:28.640
It was Ilse who brought me up, anyway.
The way I look out for Toni now.

29:30.720 --> 29:31.800
Here's to your mother.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.840
May she rest in peace.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.680
She won't rest.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.320
I used to think I was switched at birth.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.480
-But?
-It was a home birth.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.720
That would be difficult.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.320
Bruno?

30:14.880 --> 30:16.000
Did you kill him?

30:17.760 --> 30:18.600
Who? Stefan.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.960
Stefan? Jänicke?

30:31.600 --> 30:32.440
Who says?

30:32.800 --> 30:35.200
-Did you?
-No, of course not.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.360
-No?
-No!

30:37.440 --> 30:38.280
Swear.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.240
Why should I...

30:42.920 --> 30:44.720
Why should I kill Jänicke?

30:44.800 --> 30:46.320
Swear, Bruno.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.360
Yes, I swear, I didn't kill him.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.040
I swear to you.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.720
On my wife's life.

31:27.640 --> 31:34.600
<i>Every woman has a desire</i> <i>And a secret wish in her heart</i>

31:48.560 --> 31:54.760
<i>Every woman dreams of sin sometimes</i>

31:56.000 --> 31:58.920
<i>Of the greatest night</i>

31:59.800 --> 32:03.840
<i>Yet to come</i>

32:06.080 --> 32:13.040
<i>Every woman has some kind of desire</i>

32:15.560 --> 32:20.280
<i>For a sweet</i>

32:20.720 --> 32:27.240
<i>And forbidden kiss</i>

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
Bruno?

33:33.400 --> 33:34.240
Bruno?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.680
-Gereon.
-Emmi.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.160
How did you get in?

35:16.840 --> 35:19.520
With the key. I called out, too.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.640
-I wanted to return it.
-Yes.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.560
Don't tell him, OK?

35:30.680 --> 35:31.720
Nor you.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.800
That I scared you so.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.520
You weren't even here.

35:41.080 --> 35:41.920
See you soon. Yes.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.960
Gereon, what are you doing here?
Clocking off already?

36:10.160 --> 36:11.320
I know the score, Bruno.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.200
Why?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.080
I noticed you moved out.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.760
Why don't I know about it?

36:17.840 --> 36:19.440
Answer my question.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.280
Have you found something suitable?

36:28.160 --> 36:30.360
Why did you shoot Father Wilczek?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.840
With your service weapon, I take it?

36:44.520 --> 36:47.040
Why else would you have
swapped the bullets?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.160
That was a mistake.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.080
And you shouldn't have used
Krajewski's weapon.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.000
-The Lignose.
-You're totally right.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.880
But this way we have two bodies now.

37:01.640 --> 37:05.000
And all evidence
points towards a copper from Cologne...

37:06.280 --> 37:09.120
who can't deal
with the temptation of the big city.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.960
In a drug frenzy,
he first shoots a priest...

37:12.400 --> 37:15.320
and then his own assistant.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.720
How do you want to get away with this?

37:21.760 --> 37:23.840
Leave that to me, my friend.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.080
Give my regards to wife and child.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.240
I bid you goodbye.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.040
What an arsehole.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.160
Shorthand. All of it.

38:12.280 --> 38:14.520
Mr. Rath, what's going on?
Where are we going?

38:18.120 --> 38:18.960
Come.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.440
-What...
-I've got it.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.400
Where was it?

38:34.960 --> 38:36.760
Wolter had it, at home.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.000
What?

38:40.080 --> 38:41.440
I found it in his desk.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.440
That's impossible.

38:45.640 --> 38:46.480
He did it.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.480
How can you...

38:49.400 --> 38:50.840
How can you be so sure?

38:51.400 --> 38:53.120
Firstly, the forensics report.

38:53.680 --> 38:57.200
Secondly, I know where Mr. Wolter
keeps the gun. And thirdly...

39:00.120 --> 39:01.200
Charlotte, I...

39:02.640 --> 39:08.400
I tried to use a bullet from that same
weapon to deflect suspicion from myself.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.960
What suspicion?

39:12.160 --> 39:14.880
I can't read any of this,
it's all in shorthand.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.000
You have to translate this for me,
please, OK?

39:18.720 --> 39:21.280
-Here?
-No. I want you to take it with you

39:21.360 --> 39:24.080
and go home. And take your time with it.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.320
Alright.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.160
We can't trust anybody anymore.

39:34.080 --> 39:34.920
Thank you.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.920
I can't stand by and watch.

40:57.440 --> 40:58.280
Thanks.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.960
-When did you get on?
-At Spittelmarkt.

41:09.640 --> 41:12.000
Well, I think you need a schnapps.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.280
Come on, let's go to Clärchen's,
I've got a coaster there.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.440
-Shall we?
-Yes.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.880
Actually, I don't have any time.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.040
Neither do I.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.880
-What are you doing?
-Go on, get in, doll.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.320
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:10.760 --> 42:12.640
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

42:14.400 --> 42:16.120
<i>But not yet now</i>

42:18.720 --> 42:21.680
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

42:25.240 --> 42:28.000
<i>Ocean of time</i>

42:29.320 --> 42:31.120
<i>Eternal law</i>

42:32.640 --> 42:35.000
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:36.240 --> 42:37.640
<i>To ashes</i>

42:38.200 --> 42:40.280
<i>But not yet now</i>

43:01.160 --> 43:04.240
<i>It must be just a dream</i>

43:04.720 --> 43:09.040
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

43:09.120 --> 43:12.880
<i>Who really knows?</i>

43:15.760 --> 43:18.720
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

43:19.480 --> 43:22.480
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

43:22.840 --> 43:26.040
<i>Put your hand in mine</i> <i>And let us be forever</i>

43:30.400 --> 43:33.600
<i>Now you make your choice</i>

43:34.000 --> 43:38.600
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>

43:38.680 --> 43:42.760
<i>But I can forgive you</i>

43:45.000 --> 43:47.960
<i>You are very close to death</i>

43:48.720 --> 43:51.280
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

43:51.360 --> 43:55.120
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

43:55.200 --> 44:00.000
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>
