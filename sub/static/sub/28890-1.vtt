[Manou] <i>All life
starts with an egg.</i>

00:15.348 --> 00:17.716
<i>Or a chick? Or an egg?</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:19.453
[scoffs] <i>Whatever!</i>

00:21.087 --> 00:24.257
<i>The only time I saw my parents
was before I was born.</i>

00:27.661 --> 00:30.497
<i>They taught me all about
life in seconds.</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:40.539
<i>First, eggs are precious
to all animals.</i>

Water's gone, water's gone!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.165
Flood's coming, flood's coming!

01:42.469 --> 01:44.036
Water's gone, water's gone!

01:46.707 --> 01:49.676
Water? Flood's coming!

01:56.382 --> 01:58.382
-Flood's coming, flood's coming!

01:58.384 --> 02:00.419
- Some birds don't know they're
born.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.022
[Sandpiper shouting]

02:08.829 --> 02:10.426
Hi, <i>Capitan!</i>

02:10.429 --> 02:12.263
- Mmm... the wind is perfect
today.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.065
-Hello, <i>Capitan!</i>

02:14.300 --> 02:16.100
Hi, <i>Capitan!</i>

02:16.102 --> 02:18.470
- Hi, <i>Capitan.</i>
- Good to see you, Brigitte!

02:18.472 --> 02:21.675
Need to check that... [reaks]
Those swift-quarters.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.682
[all] Wrong side, airhog!

02:30.684 --> 02:32.786
- [grunts]
- Garbage trawler!

02:33.887 --> 02:36.690
Don't push your boundaries,
fleabags!

02:44.565 --> 02:45.497
-Problems?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.468
- Nah, just the smelly fleabags,
Cherry.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.436
Swifts should keep
to their side of the rock.

02:52.438 --> 02:53.774
We'll need more space.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.512
You did a great job!
Everyone's back safely.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.483
Ah, not like two years ago.
[scoffs]

03:04.518 --> 03:05.852
You should put the
past behind you.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.222
A <i>capitan</i> never forgets his
responsibility.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.694
I will never delay again.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.762
I promise.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.439
[sighs heavily]

03:27.541 --> 03:29.743
Do you think we'll be
lucky this year?

03:30.711 --> 03:33.210
Luck has nothing to do with it.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.549
Of course we'll hatch a son.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.223
[exclaiming]

03:45.626 --> 03:46.727
[grunts]

03:55.267 --> 03:56.369
Huh?

04:07.814 --> 04:08.682
[sighs]

04:11.283 --> 04:12.184
[grunts]

04:14.554 --> 04:15.720
[Blanche] Oh!

04:15.722 --> 04:18.221
- Hello there. Where did you come
from?

-[twig snaps]

04:18.858 --> 04:20.326
- [gasps]
- [grunts]

04:21.595 --> 04:24.163
- Anybody there?
- [cooing]

04:24.931 --> 04:27.501
Oh, no, no. No. Just a cricket.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.772
[whispering] Come! Come here...

04:49.456 --> 04:51.390
Sure he is in the right nest?

04:52.592 --> 04:54.226
[chuckles] Oh! Of course!

04:56.563 --> 04:58.532
And he... is not the only one.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.498
- [giggles]
- Look!

05:00.500 --> 05:01.568
Oh, the spell is broken.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.335
We'll have fledglings this year!

05:04.771 --> 05:09.339
Fantastic, Blanche! But I'm not
sure about the first one.

05:09.341 --> 05:10.608
[sniffs and grunts]

05:10.610 --> 05:12.311
[Blanche] You'll make a
wonderful dad.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.346
[laughing] Look at his claws.

05:16.348 --> 05:17.617
He can't even stand up straight.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.722
Well... that's why he needs you!

05:22.956 --> 05:24.223
[Blanche chuckles[

05:25.424 --> 05:26.925
[sighs]

05:26.927 --> 05:29.796
Peek-a-boo, Manou! Peek-a-boo.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.464
- You like Manou?
- [giggles]

05:32.466 --> 05:33.533
Teach him!

05:34.400 --> 05:35.869
Teach him to be one of us!

05:36.703 --> 05:37.969
[cooing]

05:37.971 --> 05:41.808
OK. I'll train him to become
a proper seagull.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.781
[grunting softly]

05:55.088 --> 05:57.724
Look! It's delicious.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.363
- [exclaims]
- You like it?

06:13.673 --> 06:15.807
[Blanche] Come on, come on! Open
up.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.910
Just try it. Please!

06:17.811 --> 06:20.410
Ahh, how was that?

06:20.412 --> 06:22.582
See! I will bring you
something much better.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.785
Here, try this!

06:25.819 --> 06:27.685
Good boy!

06:27.687 --> 06:30.088
[Manou] <i>Finally, they offered me
something tasty.</i>

06:30.090 --> 06:31.723
[Yves exclaiming]

06:31.725 --> 06:33.960
Seagulls do not eat bugs.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.029
Just let him try it. He is
still learning.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.801
[Manou] <i>Ever thought about
adjusting your food habits?</i>

06:43.103 --> 06:45.272
[grunts] And another one.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.572
[Yves grunts]

06:47.574 --> 06:48.975
There! Try this.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.442
[Manou] <i>That was tasty!</i>

06:52.444 --> 06:54.981
- [panting]
- <i>Can we play now?</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:57.651
[Blanche] Ah! That's exhausting.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.764
Argh. These swifts
are a real pest.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.999
Amazing fliers though?

07:13.633 --> 07:14.868
Hah, maybe.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.607
[grunts softly] Uh...

07:22.609 --> 07:25.677
But they can't take a live fish
from the sea.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.411
Just like most of us.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.083
Too busy chasing human trash
like rats.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.920
- [eggshell cracking]
- Oh, no, no, no.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.423
I won't ever forget how Yves
drove the rats off our nest.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.827
- Magnificent!
- Yes! Yves is special.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.832
[Manou] <i>Hey! I was guilty of
this ugly looking pre-hatch</i>.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.132
Hey.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.100
<i>To make matters worse,</i>

07:49.102 --> 07:51.037
<i>all birds imprint on first
sight.</i>

07:51.938 --> 07:52.806
Mama?

07:54.040 --> 07:58.545
[sighs] No, no! Me-Manou!
That's our mama.

07:59.679 --> 08:03.581
Oh, a miracle! Here
comes my son!

08:03.583 --> 08:05.886
Hello, little darling.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.554
Look, a beak just like his dad.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.424
- I'll go get Yves.
- [Blanche] Oh, look at you!

08:15.829 --> 08:16.897
Mam-ou!

08:19.132 --> 08:23.067
[sighs] His first word is mama.

08:23.069 --> 08:27.007
Blanche! Finally, my son!

08:27.874 --> 08:29.040
-Yves, look!

08:29.042 --> 08:32.645
- We'll call you Luc, like your
grandpa.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.913
Oh, how adorable.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.884
Now you take good care
of your little brother Manou.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.087
Promise, Dad!

08:42.621 --> 08:44.689
[laughing] Over here!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.824
[all laughing]

08:46.826 --> 08:50.261
Oh, Yves. Isn't it wonderful
to be a family now?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.897
Ah, it's a wish come true,
Cherry.

08:52.899 --> 08:54.433
[laughing]

08:55.568 --> 08:58.038
But it sure adds more
responsibility.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.272
We'll keep them safe.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.840
[grunting]

09:02.842 --> 09:05.211
[Yves] Boys! Come over here.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.815
See the market down there?

09:09.582 --> 09:11.017
- Yes, Dad.
- Sure.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.118
It's extremely dangerous.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.188
Never ever go down there.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.790
[Blanche] <i>And you'll be
careful of pedestrians.</i>

09:18.792 --> 09:21.726
<i>They have an unhealthy
liking for birds.</i>

09:21.728 --> 09:23.063
[exclaiming]

09:30.804 --> 09:31.938
[exclaims]

09:32.739 --> 09:33.974
Hmm! Hi, guys!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.951
[exclaiming]

09:47.620 --> 09:48.755
[shouting]

09:50.957 --> 09:52.058
[exclaiming]

09:55.862 --> 09:56.963
[screaming]

09:57.764 --> 09:58.865
[exclaims]

10:04.337 --> 10:05.705
Whoa!

10:10.643 --> 10:11.711
[screams]

10:17.250 --> 10:18.850
[yelps]

10:18.852 --> 10:20.020
[sighs]

10:20.987 --> 10:22.253
[exclaims]

10:22.255 --> 10:23.823

10:25.825 --> 10:26.993
[honking]

10:27.727 --> 10:29.095
[exclaiming]

10:29.729 --> 10:30.962
Ahh!

10:30.964 --> 10:32.866
[whooping]

11:10.236 --> 11:11.838
[birds chirping]

11:17.110 --> 11:18.776
Whoa!

11:18.778 --> 11:19.913
Oh!

11:23.750 --> 11:26.052
I can't wait to be at
sailing-school.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.088
What's in it for me?

11:28.988 --> 11:30.988
We finally learn how to fly!

11:30.990 --> 11:32.192
[grunting]

11:33.726 --> 11:35.061
[both laugh]

11:37.163 --> 11:39.063
Can you teach me to do that?

11:39.065 --> 11:40.765
Do what?

11:40.767 --> 11:42.936
- [buzzing]
- [grunting]

11:46.940 --> 11:48.074
That.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.643
- [screams]
- Luc!

11:58.017 --> 11:59.152
[sighs]

12:02.989 --> 12:05.892
I'll always take care of you.
I promise.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.356
[thunder rumbling]

12:51.204 --> 12:52.906
[chain clattering]

13:17.997 --> 13:20.300
[indistinct chattering]

13:21.434 --> 13:23.403
Welcome to sailing-school!

13:24.471 --> 13:25.805
Except you!

13:26.540 --> 13:27.774
Seagulls only.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.411
What about him?

13:33.079 --> 13:33.947
Ugh!

13:38.017 --> 13:38.452
- [chuckling]
- [Yves] Quiet!

13:39.919 --> 13:43.555
[clears throat]
Today we'll learn how to fly.

13:43.557 --> 13:46.426
First lesson, the wind
is my friend.

13:47.561 --> 13:51.162
Repeat after me. The
wind is my friend.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.298
[all] The wind is your friend.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.737
No, no, no, wrong.
The wind is <i>your</i> friend.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.839
The wind is your friend.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.808
[chuckles] Our friend.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.846
[sighs] Keep your wits,
you'll need it.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.849
Everyone step up to the ridge.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.121
Can you feel it?

14:15.955 --> 14:17.924
Feel it? I can barely
stand in it.

14:19.058 --> 14:22.960
Good! Let the wind
float your wings...

14:22.962 --> 14:26.897
adjust and now glide on it! See?

14:26.899 --> 14:29.102
Does that look inviting to you?

14:31.070 --> 14:32.071
Definitely not.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.908
Remember, the wind is my friend.

14:38.512 --> 14:42.949
Now, just spread your
wings and sail!

14:43.883 --> 14:46.052
The wind is my friend, too.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.054
You go first!

14:50.056 --> 14:53.293
- Three, two, one... go!
- [whooping]

14:55.928 --> 14:56.762
I would need more than

14:56.764 --> 14:58.231
a friend to make me
go down there.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.865
Oh, erm... Hi! I'm Manou.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.504
Oh! Percy! You really
want to jump?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.439
Come on! It can't be that bad.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.542
Whoa!

15:11.010 --> 15:12.579
Whoa!

15:15.181 --> 15:16.548
[coughing]

15:16.550 --> 15:18.552
Maybe some other day.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.386
Manou!

15:21.522 --> 15:22.556
[laughing]

15:24.558 --> 15:29.193
[exclaiming] You gotta try this!
It's magic!

15:29.195 --> 15:30.229
Whoo!

15:33.032 --> 15:34.934
"Magic." [scoffs]

15:37.236 --> 15:39.236
Happens to me all the time.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.874
Flying is... [scoffs] overrated.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.280
I heard some of us had issues
with water yesterday.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.917
But water is
fundamental to seagulls.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.286
So today's lesson... is
swimming.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.255
Just watch me.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.395
Remember, you have to paddle
with your feet.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.430
Now follow me.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.109
OK, good example. Your turn!

16:17.143 --> 16:20.244
- [stutters] You go first!
- Again?

16:20.246 --> 16:22.148
Yeah, water is not my friend.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.452
[exclaiming]

16:26.386 --> 16:28.453
[Yves] Remember to paddle!

16:28.455 --> 16:31.389
[laughing]

16:31.391 --> 16:32.724
Oh!

16:32.726 --> 16:35.428
Well done, son... Erm, young man.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.231
Come on! It's easy.

16:41.502 --> 16:44.605
- Manou! Get in the water now!
- [gasps]

16:47.039 --> 16:48.040
[grunts]

16:49.576 --> 16:51.612
[gasping]

16:52.979 --> 16:54.280
Paddle!

16:56.617 --> 16:59.252
- Paddle...
- [gasping]

17:02.255 --> 17:03.557
[panting]

17:05.258 --> 17:06.959
[coughs] It's a wrap.

17:08.227 --> 17:11.295
[sighs] You're gonna need
some private lessons.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.566
Luc, help your brother.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.467
- All right.
- OK. Good. Yeah!

17:15.469 --> 17:18.269
That's the way. Well done.
Kind of...

17:18.271 --> 17:21.137
You see... for swimming, you
actually need

17:21.140 --> 17:22.373
to be <i>in</i> the water.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.444
OK, watch this. [gasping]

17:25.579 --> 17:28.582
- I didn't mean all the way!
- [panting]

17:31.752 --> 17:34.418
[Yves] OK, listen up, Manou.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.721
I'm gonna pass on some of my
knowledge

17:36.723 --> 17:38.222
for navigation to you.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.226
Like my father once did for me.

17:41.462 --> 17:45.466
Look, the stars. Our
guides in heavens.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.165
Recognize the dolphin?

17:48.167 --> 17:50.704
He's our guide for the long
flight south.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.306
Next to it, two wings down from
its nose,

17:55.308 --> 17:55.975
the big crab.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.512
The sign of our ancestors'
memory.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.813
The guardian of all rules,
traditions

18:01.815 --> 18:04.217
and collective memory of our
community.

18:08.387 --> 18:12.459
And there, to the left,
the ultimate fish.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.594
The eternal guide which always

18:15.596 --> 18:18.429
shows us the way to delicious
seafood.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.766
Even in winter.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.202
This is our life, Manou.
Our tradition.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.271
We follow the stars,
our true path.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.375
Against all winds and rain.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.142
High. High. Soaring.

18:32.144 --> 18:35.749
Guiding us into a bright and
safe future.

18:37.718 --> 18:41.252
Manou! How can you chase bugs?

18:41.254 --> 18:44.121
I'm teaching you the
key to life!

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
[gulps] Ah... yes, Dad.
I'm sorry.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.663
Argh. Why do I waste my time?

19:00.774 --> 19:03.510
I can sail. No flapping!

19:09.550 --> 19:10.551
[screams]

19:15.489 --> 19:17.089
I hate water.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.794
[Yusuf chuckles] What
are you up to?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.465
You're going to gull
sailing-school?

19:25.899 --> 19:27.199
I'm a gull.

19:27.868 --> 19:29.636
[chuckles] No, you're not.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.837
I am!

19:32.839 --> 19:35.742
[chuckles] OK, prove it!
Fly like 'em.

19:41.715 --> 19:42.683
Not my day.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.316
You gotta be kidding.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.254
You're a swift. Every day
is a flying day.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.459
Our parents can stay on
the wing for days.

19:54.728 --> 19:57.294
What do you mean "I'm a swift"?

19:57.296 --> 20:00.164
Well... look at you. Short sleek
body,

20:00.166 --> 20:02.867
sharp narrow wings. Affinity for
flies.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.335
Of course, you're a swift.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.772
Come on! Follow us!

20:10.443 --> 20:13.480
It's easy. Just flap your wings
and follow me.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.148
Woo-hoo! Woo!

20:16.750 --> 20:18.452
Great! Can we go now?

20:20.754 --> 20:22.288
Woo-hoo!

20:24.256 --> 20:25.358
[chuckles]

20:28.762 --> 20:30.462
[Manou] Incredible!

20:30.464 --> 20:34.365
Hey, wanna try some real food?

20:34.367 --> 20:37.269
- Well, better than fireflies?
- [chuckles] You bet!

20:38.805 --> 20:41.407
[all whooping]

20:55.889 --> 20:57.758
[exclaims] Amazing!

21:00.761 --> 21:02.629
Still raiding tables I see?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.936
- Hey! That was mine!
- You want it back?

21:12.906 --> 21:16.574
- Hi! I'm... I;m Manou.
- I'm Kalifa.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.844
Catch me!

21:20.413 --> 21:22.314
Yee-haw!

21:29.388 --> 21:31.022
[sighs] Wow!

21:31.024 --> 21:33.892
- You are crazy.
- Meaning?

21:33.894 --> 21:36.561
- Yeah, man... meaning what?
- Hmm!

21:36.563 --> 21:40.297
- What? Just that Kalifa...
- Our sister.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.736
[stuttering] Meaning, your
sister is fast.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.471
- Meaning you haven't flown much,
have you?

21:46.473 --> 21:47.438
-[chuckles]

21:47.440 --> 21:50.542
Dig that, he was trying to
fly with gulls.

21:50.544 --> 21:51.843
- Argh!
- Gulls?

21:51.845 --> 21:54.311
- I grew up with gulls.
- You what?

21:54.313 --> 21:57.314
You mean your family lives
on the other side of the rock?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.985
Yeah. Where's your nest?

21:59.820 --> 22:01.420
Nah, we don't do nests.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.354
You've never been in a grotto?

22:04.356 --> 22:06.624
- No.
- Lucky you!

22:06.626 --> 22:09.761
Is it really true that
gulls attack rats?

22:09.763 --> 22:12.396
- Ah, if they try to steal our
eggs.

22:12.398 --> 22:13.565
-That is so cool!

22:13.567 --> 22:16.670
- Have you ever attacked one?
- Of course!

22:17.704 --> 22:20.337
- Can you imagine? Fighting a
rat?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.573
-[Yusuf chuckles]

22:21.575 --> 22:24.909
- Respect!
- I'll... show you some day.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.713
- See ya later.
- [Poncho] Mmm-hmm.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.816
- Let's catch up!
- Yeah, yeah.

22:31.051 --> 22:32.384
Wow!

22:34.821 --> 22:37.591
All right, Luc! Bring
it over here.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.929
[chuckling] Good fishing, son!

22:43.764 --> 22:45.966
Manou? When you're ready.

22:47.801 --> 22:48.902
[sighs]

22:51.004 --> 22:52.839
Scared of the water, are we?

23:21.001 --> 23:21.966
-[grunting]

23:21.968 --> 23:24.871
- [Yves] What have I said a
thousand times?

23:26.940 --> 23:29.341
Glide! No flapping.

23:29.943 --> 23:31.812
[grunting]

23:34.014 --> 23:35.849
[whooping]

23:39.920 --> 23:41.721
No! He can do it.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.658
- [gasps]
- Argh!

23:47.160 --> 23:48.394
[blowing raspberry]

23:49.129 --> 23:50.664
[panting]

23:54.968 --> 23:57.504
You'll never learn
the seagull way.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.574
[scoffs]

24:01.942 --> 24:03.543
Let's have lunch.

24:08.515 --> 24:09.716
[sighs heavily]

24:29.435 --> 24:30.937
[cooing]

24:31.872 --> 24:33.106
[sighs]

24:36.142 --> 24:39.077
- Ah, those swifts. A real pest.
- Real pest.

24:39.079 --> 24:40.547
[Blanche] Yves, how could you?

24:41.514 --> 24:45.216
[scoffs] How could you do that?

24:45.218 --> 24:48.152
As a gull... he needs to learn!

24:48.154 --> 24:51.157
As your son, he deserves
a bit more care and attention!

24:52.058 --> 24:54.027
He always takes good care of me.

24:54.895 --> 24:56.628
Well, all I'm saying is...

24:56.630 --> 24:59.933
Manou needs to catch up quickly
if he's gonna fly south with us.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.800
What are you suggesting?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.602
We can't just leave him here
over winter!

25:04.604 --> 25:05.536
He's your son!

25:05.538 --> 25:09.540
Argh! The colony is
already stirred up!

25:09.542 --> 25:11.976
They keep asking why he
is even here!

25:11.978 --> 25:12.679
Well, let them ask!

25:13.947 --> 25:17.083
He can fly, he can catch fish,
he can even stand on one leg!

25:18.151 --> 25:20.184
What more do you want
me to prove?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.955
Nothing! Nothing at all!

25:25.859 --> 25:29.863
Well, if he would win
the arch-race...

25:31.831 --> 25:34.834
Hmm, no one will dare say
he is not one of us.

25:36.937 --> 25:38.505
What do you think, Manou?

25:39.539 --> 25:42.642
Win the race? No problem, Mom!

25:47.814 --> 25:50.848
We are here today to see the
best flyers.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.686
The final test for our young.

25:53.286 --> 25:54.919
To prove their skill,

25:54.921 --> 25:57.958
to show they are ready
for the great journey south!

26:00.060 --> 26:02.062
[cheering and applause]

26:07.734 --> 26:11.037
- Excuse me, 'cuse me. Sorry.
- Hey! [grunts]

26:11.604 --> 26:12.739
Bleh!

26:15.775 --> 26:16.943
On your marks!

26:18.545 --> 26:19.679
Well...

26:21.748 --> 26:23.781
May the best gull win!

26:23.783 --> 26:25.685
[cheering and applause]

26:29.255 --> 26:30.256
[Blanche] Steady...

26:31.157 --> 26:33.259
- OK, I can do that!
- Go!

26:34.260 --> 26:37.163
[all whooping]

26:45.772 --> 26:48.906
- [Manou grunts]
- [Luc] Come on, you have to win!

26:48.908 --> 26:52.677
I am trying. But the wind is not
my friend today.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.781
[scoffs] Loser.

27:03.623 --> 27:04.722
[gasps]

27:04.724 --> 27:05.859
[Manou] <i>Wanna know my secret?</i>

27:07.827 --> 27:09.129
<i>I started flapping!</i>

27:13.967 --> 27:16.834
Argh, I told him not to
flap his wings.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.003
- And I told you not to flap your
beak.

27:19.005 --> 27:19.971
-[Manou chuckles]

27:19.973 --> 27:21.808
[whooping]

27:25.645 --> 27:27.614
[chuckles] Gotcha!

27:29.049 --> 27:30.116
[squawks]

27:32.118 --> 27:33.651
Ouch!

27:33.653 --> 27:35.822
So much for going south.

27:37.791 --> 27:38.858
[exclaims]

27:40.794 --> 27:42.128
[chuckles] Whoa!

27:42.962 --> 27:44.998
Eat my feathers, Storm!

27:45.698 --> 27:47.365
Hah! Good flight.

27:47.367 --> 27:48.668
[chuckles]

27:51.004 --> 27:52.338
Whoa-oh!

28:00.246 --> 28:02.649
[indistinct chattering]

28:05.118 --> 28:08.688
- Francoise is determined to win!
- Manou is too!

28:16.396 --> 28:18.998
Whoa! What was that?
Let's catch up.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.608
Am I too late?

28:42.021 --> 28:45.225
[Manou] Game on! Lets
see who's a gull!

28:49.229 --> 28:50.396
Come on!

28:55.702 --> 28:57.368
- [screams]
- [clangs]

28:57.370 --> 28:59.003
[chuckles]

28:59.005 --> 29:00.073
Whoa!

29:16.723 --> 29:18.057
I'ma get you!

29:21.127 --> 29:22.328
[cackles]

29:38.512 --> 29:40.013
Ahh!

29:44.017 --> 29:45.185
Come on!

29:53.126 --> 29:54.861
[exclaims] Uh...

30:00.433 --> 30:04.270
[panting]

30:09.175 --> 30:11.476
Whoa! Here comes the
twisted-turning part!

30:11.478 --> 30:13.146
Don't break too early!

30:13.780 --> 30:14.781
Go, go, go!

30:15.516 --> 30:16.483
[Francoise grunts]

30:18.117 --> 30:19.083
[Manou exclaims]

30:19.085 --> 30:22.021
Catch me if you can! [sighs]

30:22.489 --> 30:24.224
[Manou screaming]

30:28.127 --> 30:30.096
- Huh?
- [Manou] Beat you to the arch!

30:31.965 --> 30:32.832
[grunts]

30:35.001 --> 30:36.234
[chuckles]

30:36.236 --> 30:38.771
Manou might actually win this.

30:39.372 --> 30:41.407
[both grunting]

30:53.454 --> 30:55.286
- Whoa!
- [all gasping and groaning]

30:55.288 --> 30:56.954
[Francoise screaming
and groaning]

30:56.956 --> 30:57.855
Whoo-hoo!

30:57.857 --> 31:00.126
- [Percival] Seeds all round!
- Whoo-hoo!

31:00.994 --> 31:03.027
- We won!
- We won the race!

31:03.029 --> 31:03.995
-Manou did it!

31:03.997 --> 31:06.297
- One might think this was the
Grand Prix.

31:06.299 --> 31:09.267
[Blanche] Whoo-hoo!
Manou you did it!

31:09.269 --> 31:12.805
Well done. That's my son!
Whoo-hoo!

31:13.540 --> 31:18.009
Whoa! Welcome home the champion.

31:18.011 --> 31:19.910
[laughs] Stop it!

31:19.912 --> 31:21.912
- You did it. We're so proud of
you.

31:21.914 --> 31:22.947
-Well done, Manou.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.249
Now I really feel
like one of you!

31:25.251 --> 31:27.218
Well, since you are,

31:27.220 --> 31:30.223
tonight you can take my duty
and guard the eggs.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.293
And I can finally go to sleep.

31:34.193 --> 31:37.163
Yeah. Now I'm deputy chief.

31:39.932 --> 31:44.538
[insects chirping]

31:50.943 --> 31:54.412
[sighs] No more taunts
from Francoise.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.349
- [bee buzzing]
- No more tests.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.084
[slurps]

31:58.452 --> 32:00.587
No fish.

32:02.355 --> 32:05.892
[rats chittering]

32:07.026 --> 32:07.927
Huh?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.269
- [rats chittering]
- Hello?

32:29.349 --> 32:30.383
[squeals]

32:36.155 --> 32:36.856
Hey!

32:40.927 --> 32:43.129
Those are ours! Stay away!

32:45.264 --> 32:49.235
[grunting]

32:50.103 --> 32:52.238
[Manou continues grunting]

32:55.108 --> 32:57.243
- [rats screeching]
- [grunts]

33:00.481 --> 33:02.547
[squealing]

33:02.549 --> 33:03.484
[grunting]

33:08.221 --> 33:10.189
[groaning]

33:12.291 --> 33:15.161
[rat screeching]

33:34.347 --> 33:36.414
I'm fine. Honest.

33:36.416 --> 33:39.417
But they stole one!
And you didn't save it.

33:39.419 --> 33:40.487
[Yves grunts]

33:44.157 --> 33:46.092
Oh, my baby!

33:53.166 --> 33:54.699
That has never happened before!

33:54.701 --> 33:57.203
- That has never happened before!
- This has never happened before!

33:59.773 --> 34:01.439
[grunts]

34:01.441 --> 34:04.175
Believe me, I've fought for it!

34:04.177 --> 34:06.613
A seagull would've
saved her baby.

34:14.521 --> 34:18.024
Step aside. Come with me, Manou.

34:20.460 --> 34:24.598
- He has to go!
- Stop! Come.

34:32.706 --> 34:34.040
[sighs]

34:43.784 --> 34:46.485
What? You can't be serious!

34:46.487 --> 34:49.152
I can't protect him anymore.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.190
But he was the one who attacked
the rats to save the egg.

34:52.291 --> 34:56.495
But he didn't save it! A
gull would have!

34:56.496 --> 34:57.631
Says who?

34:58.431 --> 35:00.732
[sighs] It's too late!

35:00.734 --> 35:04.303
They'll always blame him
for being a swift.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.405
But you're my family!

35:07.073 --> 35:08.542
He's my brother.

35:10.711 --> 35:14.046
[Blanche] Not quite.
I found him in my nest.

35:14.715 --> 35:16.148
Alone and starving.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.285
I told you we
shouldn't keep him.

35:22.523 --> 35:25.424
So I'm not the champion anymore?

35:26.359 --> 35:27.461
You'll always be my champion.

35:28.862 --> 35:33.130
Believe me, I did everything I
could to make you fit in!

35:33.132 --> 35:34.431
But now you have to leave.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.169
Don't do this to me. Please.

35:37.671 --> 35:38.572
[Yves] I have to.

35:39.740 --> 35:43.109
[sighs]Sorry, Manou.

35:47.213 --> 35:50.484
[crying]

36:02.763 --> 36:04.230
[sobbing] Manou...

36:08.267 --> 36:08.735
Ah, tough break!

36:10.303 --> 36:13.838
But those yellow-legs
always were a stuck-up bunch.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.241
Claiming the best ledges
because they where first.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.711
Grabbing the best food pitches.

36:19.713 --> 36:23.180
Flying south on superior air.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.551
You're lucky to be out of there.

36:25.619 --> 36:28.722
Thanks. But not all
are like that.

36:29.623 --> 36:31.157
They took me in as a family.

36:31.892 --> 36:34.561
Well, I survived without one.

36:35.462 --> 36:36.830
Never knew them.

36:38.599 --> 36:42.299
Hatched in a cage.
But I escaped.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.839
And now this is my
home and castle!

36:46.673 --> 36:48.640
Can I stay here with you?

36:48.642 --> 36:52.646
[stuttering] Wait! You?
Stay with me?

36:53.179 --> 36:53.880
Why not?

36:55.348 --> 36:59.118
Well... [sighs] you know,
I'm not used to company.

37:00.487 --> 37:03.555
[stuttering But I could show you
how to fly.

37:03.557 --> 37:04.691
Really?

37:06.258 --> 37:09.193
Look... [stutters] it's like
whistling. Very simple.

37:09.195 --> 37:11.163
[whistling]

37:11.898 --> 37:15.634
[trying to whistle]

37:15.636 --> 37:17.871
Ay-ay-ay. Bad example.

37:18.705 --> 37:19.906
Let's try the real thing.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.541
- I got this, I got this.
- [mumbling]

37:23.543 --> 37:24.174
-Go, go, go!

37:24.176 --> 37:26.312
- [screams]
- That's it.

37:26.813 --> 37:28.682
Ow! [screaming]

37:30.349 --> 37:33.152
- Ouch.
- [yelping]

37:33.887 --> 37:35.687
[Manou] Oh... That was close.

37:35.689 --> 37:37.689
Try again. You can do it.

37:37.691 --> 37:39.591
OK there, now try the same
trick.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.593
Just add some more flapping. All
right?

37:41.595 --> 37:42.460
OK, I will.

37:42.462 --> 37:44.929
- Flap! Flap, flap, flap! High
speed!

37:44.931 --> 37:45.497
-[screams]

37:45.499 --> 37:48.867
[grunting and yelping]

37:48.869 --> 37:51.435
- Flap, flap!
- [groaning]

37:51.437 --> 37:53.471
Maybe gliding works better?

37:53.473 --> 37:56.641
- [screaming]
- [Manou] Keep going. Glide.

37:56.643 --> 37:57.441
-[yelps]

37:57.443 --> 37:59.278
- [Manou] Oh... That was so
close.

37:59.913 --> 38:01.345
Like my dad would say,

38:01.347 --> 38:03.215
you just need a bit more
practice.

38:07.688 --> 38:11.958
[grunting] Look, I... I like you,
but, uh...

38:12.592 --> 38:13.426
What?

38:14.393 --> 38:17.698
You need to find some
swift company. Soon!

38:19.633 --> 38:21.535
- Swifts fly south!
- Why?

38:22.836 --> 38:25.670
How should I know?
I climb stairs to get a view.

38:25.672 --> 38:27.038
You're the one who flies!

38:27.040 --> 38:28.973
[stutters] Couldn't I just stay
here

38:28.975 --> 38:29.509
with you?

38:31.410 --> 38:34.915
Ever counted how many flies
you catch a day?

38:35.716 --> 38:37.347
No. I just eat them.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.783
Well, it's a lot.

38:38.785 --> 38:41.586
In winter there are never
enough!

38:41.588 --> 38:43.457
But the swifts aren't going
to just adopt me!

38:44.356 --> 38:46.290
I'm not a lost chick anymore!

38:46.292 --> 38:49.494
True. But you fight rats!

38:49.496 --> 38:51.328
[scoffs] Don't remind me.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.498
But I remember one swift

38:53.500 --> 38:56.735
who was really impressed by that
idea!

38:56.737 --> 38:57.671
Who?

39:00.006 --> 39:01.641
Kalifa.

39:02.809 --> 39:04.878
You should bring her
some treats!

39:05.545 --> 39:06.376
-You think so?

39:06.378 --> 39:08.412
- Yeah, it always works with
women!

39:08.414 --> 39:10.048
[chuckles] Crazy, or what?

39:10.050 --> 39:12.786
- [chuckles] Thanks, Percy.
- Bye-bye.

39:14.721 --> 39:16.020
[sighs]

39:16.022 --> 39:18.759
[grunts and groaning]

39:19.425 --> 39:21.528
[birds chirping]

39:37.844 --> 39:39.613
Looking for someone?

39:40.714 --> 39:42.816
Um, actually, you.

39:44.584 --> 39:46.019
Now you found me.

39:46.820 --> 39:49.723
- Yes.
- So...

39:50.857 --> 39:51.992
This is for you.

39:53.693 --> 39:56.596
Thanks! This will glam
up my grotto.

39:58.064 --> 40:00.364
I need a new family.

40:00.366 --> 40:02.569
Wow. What's wrong with yours?

40:03.470 --> 40:05.005
They're not my real family.

40:05.639 --> 40:06.436
Oh, I know.

40:06.438 --> 40:07.941
I get that feeling too
sometimes.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.676
- No, it's for real. I'm an
orphan.

40:11.678 --> 40:12.510
-[gasps]

40:12.512 --> 40:15.680
Hey, man! You sure
beat those gulls!

40:15.682 --> 40:19.450
Awesome! But why race
immature guano poopers?

40:19.452 --> 40:21.721
- He means yellow-feet.
- Who was your buddy?

40:22.522 --> 40:24.923
Well he's... my brother.

40:24.925 --> 40:27.326
- Really?
- Whoa. You're kidding, right?

40:28.528 --> 40:31.598
Well... Technically... I...
I don't know.

40:32.799 --> 40:35.936
You are really special.
Don't get jealous!

40:37.037 --> 40:39.105
- Why don't you join us?
- Seriously?

40:40.540 --> 40:44.408
Hey, stupid! You're a swift!
You belong to us!

40:44.410 --> 40:47.078
- Hmm. We sure could use a
rat-fighter!

40:47.080 --> 40:47.948
-[screaming]

40:48.715 --> 40:50.650
[swifts chirping]

40:56.022 --> 40:57.922
How do you like your new home?

40:57.924 --> 40:59.926
Love it! It's next to yours.

41:00.827 --> 41:03.027
It's short, narrow and damp.

41:03.029 --> 41:05.429
Not as homey as at the seagulls.

41:05.431 --> 41:06.933
Better get used to it.

41:09.035 --> 41:12.005
- Good night, Kalifa.
- Good night, Manou.

41:13.073 --> 41:15.141
Let me help you with
the Rosemary.

41:16.943 --> 41:20.412
- Hello?
- [both laughing]

41:22.549 --> 41:23.917
- [kissing sound]
- [slap]

41:25.051 --> 41:27.552
- [Kalifa] I'm not that kind of
girl!

41:27.554 --> 41:27.787
-Wow.

41:38.832 --> 41:39.833
Morning.

41:44.070 --> 41:45.572
Ready for some breakfast?

41:49.843 --> 41:51.075
Oh, thank you!

41:51.077 --> 41:54.646
That looks suspicious... Sorry
delicious!

41:54.648 --> 41:56.981
But I need to feed
my sisters and brothers first.

41:56.983 --> 41:59.653
But it's fresh!
You've got to try.

42:03.757 --> 42:05.957
See, still dancing!

42:05.959 --> 42:08.660
Now slowly slurp. [slurping]

42:08.662 --> 42:10.028
Swirl it on your tongue,

42:10.030 --> 42:13.667
enjoy the salty ocean
flavor and swallow.

42:15.001 --> 42:16.868
Tasty! Thank you.

42:16.870 --> 42:18.872
Now, you want to help me
with these protein rolls?

42:21.942 --> 42:25.745
[grunting]

42:26.246 --> 42:27.814
You're amazing!

42:30.984 --> 42:34.087
What is this? Some kind of
mystic pow-wow?

42:35.655 --> 42:39.991
No, just are daily routine
of flea-picking. It's fun!

42:39.993 --> 42:41.793
I better check you too!

42:41.795 --> 42:43.797
Are you suggesting I
have vermin?

42:47.968 --> 42:49.968
[exclaims] There we are.

42:49.970 --> 42:53.871
Oh. [chuckles]
Are you sure you got 'em all?

42:53.873 --> 42:54.941
[whistling]

42:55.875 --> 42:57.177
Now it's your turn!

42:57.711 --> 42:58.745
Huh?

42:59.212 --> 43:01.081
[chirping]

43:02.615 --> 43:04.015
- Ah, ready for my special
treatment?

43:04.017 --> 43:04.716
-Uh...

43:04.718 --> 43:06.786
It's called the rock-twister!

43:07.587 --> 43:09.921
[exclaims and screams]

43:09.923 --> 43:11.923
Don' be shy. It's natural.

43:11.925 --> 43:15.795
[Manou groaning]

43:24.804 --> 43:26.506
[sniffling]

43:35.915 --> 43:37.517
How are you, Manou?

43:38.985 --> 43:42.689
I wish we could fly together
again. [sniffling]

43:44.357 --> 43:47.025
[yawning]

43:47.027 --> 43:50.697
[sighs] Luc, are you
one of them?

43:51.364 --> 43:54.734
I miss your jokes. [sighs]

43:57.037 --> 43:59.072
Come on! It's time for our
afternoon-hunt.

43:59.873 --> 44:01.241
Maybe some other time.

44:02.642 --> 44:05.812
But we always fly together,
no exceptions.

44:08.181 --> 44:10.717
[grunts] Hey! Where
are you going?

44:12.018 --> 44:14.654
- Just go with the flow.
- I'm trying.

44:15.755 --> 44:19.057
- Ow! [grunts] Oh!
- Hey, watch out!

44:19.059 --> 44:21.059
I think I'd rather fly solo.

44:21.061 --> 44:24.030
You have to crack this
if you want to be one of us.

44:24.864 --> 44:28.001
[yelps] Ah! Oh! Help me!

44:29.803 --> 44:31.803
[Poncho] Whoa! You all right?

44:31.805 --> 44:33.905
- What is this?
- Rat-fighter-style?

44:33.907 --> 44:34.240
-[Poncho laughs]

44:35.141 --> 44:37.577
Shouldn't you two be
collecting snacks?

44:38.344 --> 44:40.246
Yeah, yeah. Hunt like an eagle.

44:41.314 --> 44:43.149
Wow! This is just too
much for me.

44:44.350 --> 44:47.718
Couldn't we just fly in pairs?
You and me?

44:47.720 --> 44:49.353
What's the advantage? I
don't get it.

44:49.355 --> 44:52.358
We fly together as one flock.
We feel as one.

44:53.827 --> 44:56.262
Don't miss the best part.
I'm part of the team.

44:57.363 --> 45:00.767
Just follow me. It's easy,
you'll see.

45:01.734 --> 45:03.701
- Ready?
- What?

45:03.703 --> 45:05.238
Turn, now!

45:06.973 --> 45:08.106
How did you know?

45:08.108 --> 45:10.241
All of you turned without
warning!

45:10.243 --> 45:12.979
Swarm intelligence. Autopilot.
You can do it too!

45:14.180 --> 45:16.850
I learned to fly in formation!
It's safer!

45:18.017 --> 45:21.152
Nonsense! Close your eyes.
Feel the flow.

45:21.154 --> 45:22.420
You're kidding, right?

45:22.422 --> 45:25.022
Trust me. Listen to your
neighbors flaps.

45:25.024 --> 45:26.092
Let them guide you.

45:38.838 --> 45:40.138
Whoa!

45:40.140 --> 45:43.841
- You got the idea?
- Yeah! Again!

45:43.843 --> 45:46.310
Yeah, all right! [laughs]

45:46.312 --> 45:48.748
This really is magic! Whoo!

46:04.964 --> 46:08.366
[stutters and grunts]
Have you seen my brother?

46:08.368 --> 46:09.333
-Hey!

46:09.335 --> 46:12.003
- Watch-out! Your navigation
needs fixing!

46:12.005 --> 46:14.272
Theirs only works at night.
[laughs]

46:14.274 --> 46:15.507
He's kinda short,

46:15.509 --> 46:18.309
sleek body, with narrow wings...
[pants]

46:18.311 --> 46:20.446
[stutters] Dark feathers, creamy
collar and pointy beak?

46:21.848 --> 46:24.348
Come on, take your pick.
I see a lot of those.

46:24.350 --> 46:27.218
No. He's, uh, special.

46:27.220 --> 46:30.154
Oh, I've heard that before.
You're talking about Manou.

46:30.156 --> 46:31.758
He must be on his way
to summer party.

46:32.459 --> 46:34.292
The band will play tonight.

46:34.294 --> 46:36.928
I'd love to see that.
Can I join?

46:36.930 --> 46:39.032
Read my beak. No way!

46:39.500 --> 46:40.833
[sighs]

46:59.453 --> 47:00.885
- [Manou] Oh, hey!
- [Yusuf] Hi.

47:00.887 --> 47:02.887
- [Poncho] Hey, wassup!
- Ready to rumble?

47:02.889 --> 47:04.290
Yeah.

47:05.825 --> 47:07.425
[Yusuf] Ah, pretty slick there,

47:07.427 --> 47:08.460
-Master Flash.

47:08.462 --> 47:10.430
- Whoo-hoo! Just found a
rockstar!

47:10.964 --> 47:11.796
-Ooh!

47:11.798 --> 47:14.801
- And this is supposed to do
what?

47:15.134 --> 47:16.267
Yeah!

47:16.269 --> 47:19.538
Well, who's bright idea was it
to have a gig anyways?

47:19.540 --> 47:22.242
That would be me. Ready?

47:23.309 --> 47:26.246
A one, a two, a one, two,
three...

47:35.255 --> 47:36.422
[scat singing]

47:37.257 --> 47:39.423
Whoo-hoo! Oh, look at me!

47:39.425 --> 47:40.393
[all] Huh?

47:55.509 --> 47:58.945
[grunts] Yeah! [laughs]

48:31.545 --> 48:33.246
[clinking]

48:55.034 --> 48:59.372

I am a swift!

50:48.749 --> 50:51.452
You bet! [laughs] You
fly like one.

50:52.653 --> 50:55.188
Come closer, I want to
tell you a secret.

50:56.289 --> 51:00.092
- Let me guess, you like my song?
- Uh-huh.

51:00.627 --> 51:02.563
I like you. A lot.

51:03.262 --> 51:05.965
Me too, Ranger.

- [swifts laughing]
- Manou?

51:34.695 --> 51:36.329
Lunch is on me.

51:38.364 --> 51:39.566
Ready?

51:41.602 --> 51:42.536
You bet!

51:43.336 --> 51:45.071
[Poncho laughs] Baby!

51:48.140 --> 51:51.776
- No. No. Ah...
- [Luc] Manou! Wait for me!

51:51.778 --> 51:53.645
- [Yusuf] This is how we do it!
- Yeah, OK.

- Luc.
- Great to see you.

- Hey! Let him go!

52:52.639 --> 52:55.676
[squeaking]

52:56.743 --> 52:58.645
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

52:59.613 --> 53:01.414
[Poncho] But it looks like fun.

53:01.882 --> 53:05.149
[grunting]

53:05.151 --> 53:06.853
Are you crazy?

[Manou] Come on!

53:24.504 --> 53:26.938

Leave him alone!

One, two...

[all exclaim]

53:40.587 --> 53:43.888
- Thanks.
- Whoa! Did you see us?

53:43.890 --> 53:45.757
That was the most stupid thing...

53:45.759 --> 53:48.460
No, the most bravest thing
I've ever seen.

53:48.462 --> 53:51.630
- I've got a great plan.
- Not now, Luc.

53:51.632 --> 53:53.465
But I've been wanting
to tell you this for days!

53:53.467 --> 53:54.933
You know this guy?

53:54.935 --> 53:57.234
[stutters] He's my brother, Luc.

53:57.236 --> 54:00.304
This is Kalifa and her brothers
Poncho and Yusuf

54:00.306 --> 54:01.539
- Wassup?
- Hey.

54:01.541 --> 54:04.408
Wow! You got a girlfriend?

54:04.410 --> 54:05.944
Pleased to meet you.

54:05.946 --> 54:08.980
Sorry, we got to go.
It's starting to rain soon.

54:08.982 --> 54:10.884
OK, I'll be with you
in a minute.

54:14.621 --> 54:15.756
[Manou] You're leaving soon.

54:16.690 --> 54:17.791
Are you gong to come with us?

54:18.892 --> 54:22.594
All birds need to go south.
So what's the problem?

54:22.596 --> 54:25.563
- I'm with Kalifa.
- Then bring her too!

54:25.565 --> 54:27.266
We'll stay with the swarm.

54:29.268 --> 54:30.468
You do not want to fly

54:30.470 --> 54:32.504
with 50 swifts around you.
Believe me.

54:32.506 --> 54:34.304
OK, but they don't have to come.

54:34.306 --> 54:35.874
You and Kalifa can leave with
us.

54:35.876 --> 54:37.075
You'll be safe with me.

54:37.077 --> 54:41.613
I've learned my lesson.
I'm a swift. And you're a gull.

54:41.615 --> 54:44.818
So what? We're a team!
Together we're strong!

54:48.655 --> 54:52.358
Oh, I get it. Swifts come first.

54:53.292 --> 54:55.662
You will always be my brother.

54:57.564 --> 54:59.499
We'll see each other
next spring. OK?

55:00.500 --> 55:02.536
- Leave me alone.
- Take care.

55:12.946 --> 55:15.247
So, you did the right thing.

55:15.849 --> 55:18.817
True, swift attacks rat,

55:18.819 --> 55:21.220
not your everyday tweet.

55:21.655 --> 55:22.354
Don't remind me.

55:23.457 --> 55:26.893
Look, everyone sometimes believe
they do not belong.

55:27.694 --> 55:29.994
Oh! I love this song!

55:29.996 --> 55:33.898
["Fly With Me" playing on radio]

55:33.900 --> 55:35.299
Where did you find that?

55:35.301 --> 55:37.003
Abandoned on the beach.

55:37.871 --> 55:38.737
Fancy a tune?

55:38.739 --> 55:41.307
It's much better than a hollow
stick.

55:42.441 --> 55:44.711
How do you choose
between two families?

55:45.612 --> 55:47.812
Why ask me? I never had one.

55:47.814 --> 55:50.650
Sorry, slipped my mind.
And a partner?

55:51.752 --> 55:54.819
Uh... Lost her to a thanksgiving
dinner,

55:54.821 --> 55:55.354
two years ago.

55:56.388 --> 55:58.823
Trust in yourself, Manou!

55:58.825 --> 56:01.526
Time to go, wind is picking up.

56:01.528 --> 56:04.428
- Well, how do you know?
- I have a feeling.

56:04.430 --> 56:06.363
Is that why my head hurts?

56:06.365 --> 56:08.869
No. That's because
you headbutted three rats.

56:10.103 --> 56:12.639
I know a perfect place for us.
You're coming?

56:13.740 --> 56:17.374
- Sounds great!
- Another time, Percy.

56:17.376 --> 56:18.943
[Percy groans]

56:18.945 --> 56:20.845
No, you don't understand.

56:20.847 --> 56:22.949
He actually beat those rats and
saved me.

56:24.050 --> 56:26.651
Manou is not able to
rescue anybody.

56:26.653 --> 56:27.952
Remember the stolen egg?

56:27.954 --> 56:30.420
I remember you lost the race!

56:30.422 --> 56:32.490
[both grunting]

56:32.492 --> 56:34.060
- [Luc] Hey!
- Enough!

56:35.061 --> 56:36.895
We all remember your efforts

56:36.897 --> 56:37.898
to protect the colony,
Francoise.

56:39.065 --> 56:42.634
- You, follow me.
- You... [grunts mockingly]

56:42.636 --> 56:43.835
[grunts back mockingly]

56:43.837 --> 56:45.870
Oh, I could've kicked her butt.

56:45.872 --> 56:47.605
We go south soon.

56:47.607 --> 56:48.940
You should not pick fights

56:48.942 --> 56:50.708
with other members of the
colony.

56:50.710 --> 56:53.778
- We need to trust each other.
- I trust Manou.

56:53.780 --> 56:55.013
I know you miss him,

56:55.015 --> 56:57.015
but this is not the right
moment.

56:57.017 --> 56:59.484
Swift and gulls go their
different ways.

56:59.486 --> 57:00.752
Let's leave it at that.

57:00.754 --> 57:02.987
Fine! I'll stay here with Manou.

57:02.989 --> 57:05.857
This colony depends
on all of us sticking together.

57:05.859 --> 57:08.392
No more arguing, you're
coming with us!

than your favorite spot!

- Huh?

57:27.647 --> 57:32.085

Don't worry! We'll
get them back!

58:13.760 --> 58:14.993
-Where did they go?

58:14.995 --> 58:16.463
- The old city. Behind the
market.

58:17.163 --> 58:18.798
Let's get Yusuf and Poncho!

58:19.599 --> 58:22.800

look.

58:52.966 --> 58:53.833
-And then what?

58:54.935 --> 58:57.103
- I'll know when I get there.
- [groans]

59:02.976 --> 59:04.609

59:04.611 --> 59:06.678
[gasps] Couldn't you just wait?

59:06.680 --> 59:08.246
I thought you need
some extra help.

59:08.248 --> 59:10.917
Yeah, we'll need more than that.

59:11.685 --> 59:14.852
Oh, OK. Lets go!

59:14.854 --> 59:17.757
- You make sure no one leaves.
- [chuckles]

59:18.658 --> 59:19.759
[both] Oh...

59:20.927 --> 59:22.696

59:30.603 --> 59:33.104
Well... [stuttering]
it's too stuffy.

59:33.106 --> 59:34.772
You grew up in a grotto.

59:34.774 --> 59:36.674
[stammering] I raised
my standards.

59:36.676 --> 59:39.012
Hi, guys! Huh?

59:40.313 --> 59:43.247
Why is a seagull helping us
to save our eggs?

59:43.249 --> 59:47.185
Lets just say it's a
family affair.

59:47.187 --> 59:49.756
[chuckles] OK, lets get
the eggs back.

59:50.223 --> 59:52.225
Yeah, you bet!

Shh.

Whoa.

Oh...

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:06.873
What's in those barrels?

01:00:07.307 --> 01:00:08.973
Uh... Ah...

01:00:08.975 --> 01:00:11.109
- Beaujolais primeur.
- Mm.

It's wine.

01:00:12.312 --> 01:00:13.177
What?

01:00:13.179 --> 01:00:15.880

- I won't change our schedule.
- Why?

You're the leader of
this colony.

01:08:14.528 --> 01:08:17.161
Because I am the leader
of the colony,

01:08:17.162 --> 01:08:19.666
I will not make the same
mistake twice.

01:08:21.502 --> 01:08:22.335
You don't understand, honey.

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:27.071
Two years ago, we waited for
the winds to die down.

01:08:27.073 --> 01:08:28.040
We thought it would be safer.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.140
When we took off, the sky was
clear,

01:08:31.143 --> 01:08:32.411
everyone thought we where
safe...

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:35.147

coast of Italy.

We lost your grandpa.

- Which is?
- You're no longer one of them.

01:08:58.237 --> 01:09:01.073
Hmm, great. I'm glad you spelled
that out for me.

01:09:02.576 --> 01:09:04.511

see them again?

01:09:05.176 --> 01:09:05.712
They'll make it.

01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:38.672
It was between the
other stolen eggs.

01:10:39.438 --> 01:10:40.139
Mama!

01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:42.843
- Uh, no, no, no.
- Hmm?

01:10:43.376 --> 01:10:43.777
Papa?

01:10:44.811 --> 01:10:46.613
Does anybody know
what she wants?

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.347
Maybe she's hungry.

01:10:48.782 --> 01:10:49.483
It's yummy!

01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:52.853
- [spits]
- Maybe fleas are bugging her?

01:10:53.687 --> 01:10:56.422
[laughing]

01:10:57.356 --> 01:10:59.358
Yeah. Let's get her to sleep.

01:11:00.326 --> 01:11:02.261
[squeaking]

01:11:02.963 --> 01:11:04.729
- [screaming]
- [shushing]

01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:06.798
- Oh, great!
- [screaming]

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.566
- Huh! No gull around when you
need one.

01:11:08.568 --> 01:11:09.233
-[screaming]

01:11:09.235 --> 01:11:11.435
Well, there's that half one.

01:11:11.437 --> 01:11:12.671
- [groans]
- [screaming]

01:11:12.673 --> 01:11:14.238
- [gasps]
- [screaming]

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.409
OK, I'll go get him.

01:11:24.651 --> 01:11:26.818
Is that the storm?

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.020
No! Just some gusty winds.

01:11:29.022 --> 01:11:31.458
Yeah, says the storm prophet.

01:11:32.391 --> 01:11:34.561
Don't worry, he's our Capitan.

01:11:35.662 --> 01:11:37.798
- Yelling!
- [Blanche] Luc!

01:11:38.364 --> 01:11:40.364
[panting]

01:11:40.366 --> 01:11:42.401
- Everything will be fine.
- I can't look.

01:11:46.338 --> 01:11:47.941
[whining]

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.877
- Huh?
- Oh.

01:11:52.278 --> 01:11:55.347
Manou! Please help, she
doesn't eat flies.

01:11:55.849 --> 01:11:56.681
Constantly whining

01:11:56.683 --> 01:11:58.518
and doesn't even fit in the
cave.

01:11:58.885 --> 01:11:59.820
[squeaks]

01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:03.555
Sorry, I can't.

01:12:03.557 --> 01:12:05.623
- What? Are you crazy?
- What? Why?

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.959
But you know what gulls need!

01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:09.894
And suddenly that's good, huh?

01:12:09.896 --> 01:12:12.298
[Female swift] But look at the
poor little thing.

01:12:13.332 --> 01:12:14.333
No way to save her.

01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:17.838
She will be banished
and outcast.

01:12:18.638 --> 01:12:19.506
Like me.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.409
We're sorry, Manou.

01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:26.345
You want to save her?

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080
Then we have to change our ways!

01:12:29.082 --> 01:12:31.983
Stop the quarrel between
us birds. Now!

01:12:31.985 --> 01:12:33.252
Well, yes, but how?

01:12:34.386 --> 01:12:35.889
Those gulls are flying
into the storm!

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.422
We need to help them!

01:12:38.424 --> 01:12:40.492
I'm not flying into that storm!

01:12:40.494 --> 01:12:42.361
Oh, not for seagulls!

01:12:47.033 --> 01:12:49.033
I know, I'm not like you!

01:12:49.035 --> 01:12:50.604
I was raised as a gull.

01:12:54.775 --> 01:12:56.340
I know the difference.

01:12:56.342 --> 01:12:57.675
-[Male swift] Wrong side!

01:12:57.677 --> 01:12:58.779
- Don't push your boundaries,
fleabags!

01:13:00.046 --> 01:13:02.381
But I've also learned
what we have in common!

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:04.350
All of us are at home here.

01:13:05.452 --> 01:13:07.921
We all fly! Go south
for the winter.

01:13:08.588 --> 01:13:09.388
We're all birds.

01:13:10.657 --> 01:13:12.793
We all have to protect our eggs
from the rats.

01:13:13.927 --> 01:13:16.897
We live like birds, we
breed like birds.

01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:21.768
We can adjust our path,

01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:23.837
shape our future.

01:13:25.772 --> 01:13:27.605
I will save my brother.

01:13:27.607 --> 01:13:30.875
A gull! The gull who
saved swift eggs!

01:13:30.877 --> 01:13:31.912
Will you join me?

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:37.784
[sighs]

01:13:40.687 --> 01:13:41.555
Mm-mm.

01:13:42.122 --> 01:13:43.655
I'm going.

01:13:43.657 --> 01:13:45.857
- I'll follow you.
- Me, too.

01:13:45.859 --> 01:13:47.792
- [Male swift #1] Me, too!
- [Male swift #2] Me, too!

01:13:47.794 --> 01:13:49.863
- [Male swift #3] Me, too!
- [Male swift #4] Me, four!

01:13:51.397 --> 01:13:53.097
This is insane!

01:13:53.099 --> 01:13:54.566
No doubt!

01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:56.100
We always fly together.

01:13:56.102 --> 01:13:57.103
Oh.

01:14:01.074 --> 01:14:02.774
Do you know this tune?

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:05.176
[singing]

01:14:05.178 --> 01:14:07.681
Oh you are such a natural.

01:14:08.414 --> 01:14:09.950
I'll call you Patty.

01:14:12.919 --> 01:14:15.053
We won't reach them before
the storm hits.

01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:16.122
I know.

01:14:20.426 --> 01:14:21.726
[thunder rumbling]

01:14:21.728 --> 01:14:23.761
[Luc groaning]

01:14:23.763 --> 01:14:24.829
Fly higher!

01:14:24.831 --> 01:14:28.432
That is what I was trying to do!
But I can't... Ah!

01:14:28.434 --> 01:14:29.469
[screaming]

01:14:31.037 --> 01:14:32.005
Luc!

01:14:32.873 --> 01:14:34.941
My wing hurts too much.

01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:38.678
[thunder rumbling]

01:14:39.746 --> 01:14:41.715
- [groans]
- Yves, we need a new plan.

01:14:42.515 --> 01:14:44.551
I'm open to suggestions.

01:14:46.019 --> 01:14:48.987
Oh, now he is open to
suggestions.

01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:50.488
- Whoa!
- Luc!

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.157
Ah!

01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:56.596
[groaning]

01:14:57.731 --> 01:15:00.166
Colony, get ready to
land on the water.

01:15:01.067 --> 01:15:03.503
[squawking]

01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:05.639
Ah!

01:15:06.139 --> 01:15:09.142
[all screaming]

01:15:26.927 --> 01:15:28.929
[yelling]

01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:39.539
[chirping]

01:15:43.109 --> 01:15:45.211
[chirping continues]

01:15:48.114 --> 01:15:48.848
Manou!

01:15:49.983 --> 01:15:53.718
Hey there! Emergency-core ready
and at your service.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.522
[exclaims]

01:15:56.556 --> 01:15:57.123
Quick.

01:15:57.757 --> 01:15:59.626
Well... how?

01:16:02.696 --> 01:16:05.732
- How did you find us?
- It's a swift thing.

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:08.032
Oh, you're just in time!

01:16:08.034 --> 01:16:10.535
How do you like
another adventure, brother?

01:16:10.537 --> 01:16:12.103
[grunting]

01:16:12.105 --> 01:16:14.639
- [whoops]
- First rescue accomplished,

01:16:14.641 --> 01:16:17.077
Bravo, Manou! What do we do now?

01:16:17.811 --> 01:16:19.043
Follow me.

01:16:19.045 --> 01:16:19.980
Where to?

01:16:20.847 --> 01:16:22.082
Into the eye of the storm!

01:16:22.949 --> 01:16:24.017
Oh, you got to be kidding.

01:16:24.951 --> 01:16:26.584
But that's way too dangerous.

01:16:26.586 --> 01:16:27.986
But do you have a better idea?

01:16:27.988 --> 01:16:29.656
- It's safe there!
- [grunts]

01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:31.224
Trust me.

01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:33.493
Hey, are you sure?

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.495
It's a swift thing.

01:16:38.131 --> 01:16:40.100
Colony! Rise!

01:16:40.767 --> 01:16:41.835
Follow her.

01:16:44.037 --> 01:16:46.604
And why are we doing this again?

01:16:46.606 --> 01:16:48.973
Eh, because we're all birds?

01:16:48.975 --> 01:16:51.177
Come on, you lazy feather-boa.

01:16:52.078 --> 01:16:53.344
This for a rest.

01:16:53.346 --> 01:16:54.245
Get going!

01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:57.517
[laughs] Feather-boa.
That kills me.

01:16:58.218 --> 01:16:59.951
[thunder rumbling]

01:16:59.953 --> 01:17:01.087
Follow her!

01:17:03.156 --> 01:17:06.159
[thunder rumbling]

01:17:08.094 --> 01:17:08.728
Ah.

01:17:09.596 --> 01:17:11.229
- [grunts]
- That's suicide.

01:17:11.231 --> 01:17:12.766
We're almost there.

01:17:15.869 --> 01:17:17.537
Go, into the wall!

01:17:18.071 --> 01:17:19.237
[gasps]

01:17:19.239 --> 01:17:20.705
Are you crazy?

01:17:20.707 --> 01:17:23.674
- [groaning]
- [squawking]

01:17:23.676 --> 01:17:25.578
Follow me, now!

01:17:29.616 --> 01:17:31.117
Ah! Help me!

01:17:35.088 --> 01:17:36.387
Please!

01:17:36.389 --> 01:17:38.625
[thunder rumbling]

01:17:39.325 --> 01:17:40.960
Aah!

01:17:45.298 --> 01:17:47.267
Hey, that beats rats any day.

01:17:48.334 --> 01:17:51.369
Kalifa, you are some
kind of bird.

01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:53.971
True, but how do we
get out of here?

01:17:53.973 --> 01:17:55.773
We wait here until it's over!

01:17:55.775 --> 01:17:58.743
No! We have to go to
the top quickly.

01:17:58.745 --> 01:18:00.945
- The eye only lasts so long.
- [gasps]

01:18:00.947 --> 01:18:02.248
Uh... what?

01:18:03.283 --> 01:18:05.349
Seagulls shouldn't
fly that high.

01:18:05.351 --> 01:18:07.385
Open to suggestions, remember?

01:18:07.387 --> 01:18:10.154
Right! That's why you adopted me
in the first place!

01:18:10.156 --> 01:18:12.592
So, what are we waiting for?

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.095
At your command!

01:18:15.962 --> 01:18:17.230
Stay together, to the top!

01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:20.867
[chirping frantically]

01:18:25.972 --> 01:18:26.339
[grunts]

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.107
Hey! Where's the top?

01:18:29.109 --> 01:18:30.141
This way.

01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:32.877
I'm glad you still have
the swift-thing working.

01:18:32.879 --> 01:18:34.614
Yeah, mine is broken.

01:18:36.749 --> 01:18:38.783
Keep going... Keep going!

01:18:38.785 --> 01:18:41.187
[chirping continues]

01:18:56.269 --> 01:18:57.871
Woo-hoo!

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.108
[laughs]

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:05.111
Oh, what a ride!

01:19:05.845 --> 01:19:07.411
Is everybody safe?

01:19:07.413 --> 01:19:08.348
- Luc is missing!
- [gasps]

01:19:09.215 --> 01:19:12.150
- Where's Poncho?
- And the feather-boa!

01:19:12.152 --> 01:19:14.952
They will be here any minute,
they're a strong team!

01:19:14.954 --> 01:19:17.288
Not that strong! He is injured!

01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:19.292
- Let's go.
- No, no, no. No stunts!

01:19:20.193 --> 01:19:21.828
Oh, no, not again.

01:19:24.898 --> 01:19:26.966
Hey! Are you OK?

01:19:27.367 --> 01:19:29.200
[grunting]

01:19:29.202 --> 01:19:32.170
- We never should have left.
- I had no choice.

01:19:32.172 --> 01:19:34.841
Argh, the rules.
And now we loose both sons?

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:38.211
The rules will be adjusted!

01:19:39.445 --> 01:19:41.981
- Manou! Ah!
- Poncho!

01:19:42.483 --> 01:19:44.182
- Luc!
- Manou!

01:19:44.184 --> 01:19:45.251
It's so far.

01:19:46.386 --> 01:19:48.988
You took the wrong train! Up!
Not down.

01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:51.789
- Flap crazy!
- Like a swift?

01:19:51.791 --> 01:19:55.494
What else? With warp-speed!
Follow me!

01:19:55.496 --> 01:19:57.797
[thunder rumbling]

01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:08.808
- Luc!
- Manou!

01:20:10.777 --> 01:20:13.012
It's calm here. You wanna try?

01:20:15.915 --> 01:20:17.217
Well done, Luc.

01:20:21.854 --> 01:20:23.823
Thank you, my son.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.496
Manou saved our colony.

01:20:30.564 --> 01:20:32.165
With a little help
from his friends.

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:36.135
True, without you, I
would've been toast.

01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:39.239
Thank you to the swifts!

01:20:41.007 --> 01:20:43.009
- Friends?
- Yes.

01:20:43.343 --> 01:20:44.444
Friends.

01:20:45.278 --> 01:20:48.114
[all laughing]

01:20:55.288 --> 01:20:58.291
[chirping]

01:21:02.395 --> 01:21:04.063
- Hello!
- What's up?

01:21:04.998 --> 01:21:06.766
- You all right?
- Hey, yeah!

01:21:13.139 --> 01:21:16.142
[indistinct chatter]

01:21:17.877 --> 01:21:20.481
- [Brigitte] Hi, Capitan.
- Good to see you, Brigitte.

01:21:23.349 --> 01:21:24.851
Choose carefully.

01:21:26.052 --> 01:21:28.152
What a beautiful grotto.

01:21:28.154 --> 01:21:29.490
Great location.

01:21:30.423 --> 01:21:32.256
But it smells like swift.

01:21:32.258 --> 01:21:35.026
- [laughing]
- Hey, hey, hey, neighbors!

01:21:35.028 --> 01:21:38.062
Check out my new nest.
Pretty sweet, huh?

01:21:38.064 --> 01:21:40.197
Uh, you think that is rat proof?

01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:45.970
[chuckles] Don't worry, Cherie,
I've defeated many rats.

01:21:45.972 --> 01:21:48.239
Dude! Come on! You
have to see this!

01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:50.341
- Percy is giving flying lessons!
- [laughs]

01:21:50.343 --> 01:21:52.076
- Up for a race?
- [laughs]

01:21:52.078 --> 01:21:53.478
- First to the beach.
- Whoo!

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.979
[laughs]

01:21:54.981 --> 01:21:56.115
What are you up to?

01:21:57.183 --> 01:21:59.486
Flight training. Patty,
come here.

01:22:00.153 --> 01:22:02.019
Yes, Percipa!

01:22:02.021 --> 01:22:04.489
- Percival can fly?
- Why not?

01:22:04.491 --> 01:22:05.992
Percy has raised a baby gull.

01:22:06.493 --> 01:22:07.892
Can we join?

01:22:07.894 --> 01:22:09.160
Uh-uh-uh.

01:22:09.162 --> 01:22:11.498
Swifts and seagulls only.

01:22:11.998 --> 01:22:12.865
Oh.

01:22:14.267 --> 01:22:16.233
Ha! Got you! [laughs]

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:18.436
Line up and follow my
instructions.

01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:20.073
[giggles] Sure this
is a good idea?

01:22:21.374 --> 01:22:23.242
Looks like the tides
have turned for the better.

01:22:24.043 --> 01:22:25.512
Run, run, run, run, run!

01:22:26.913 --> 01:22:29.914
- Run? No, no. It's more
like jump and run!

01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:31.349
Steady?

01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:33.353
Jump, run, jump, run!

01:22:34.187 --> 01:22:36.420
- Go!
- Yeah! Go for it!

01:22:36.422 --> 01:22:37.355
You can do it!

01:22:37.357 --> 01:22:39.892
Run, jump, run, jump!

01:22:42.295 --> 01:22:45.298
[cheering]

01:22:52.473 --> 01:22:54.608
