<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.760 --> 00:05.320
My name is Elizabeth. I'm your mother.

00:05.880 --> 00:09.509
- Is this woman my mother?
- Your mom is gone, Peyton.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.956
But your biological mother is alive.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.268
You and Haley fighting?

00:14.360 --> 00:16.920
My problem is with anybody
who just vanishes

00:17.000 --> 00:19.560
and then waltzes back in
and expects to be instantly forgiven.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.719
You know, we could totally have
a summer-like fling, just in the fall.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.109
And non-exclusive.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.271
There wasn't a moment when I was away
that my heart wasn't with you in Tree Hill.

00:32.360 --> 00:36.035
I'm going to High Flyers, and unlike you,
I'm taking my heart with me.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.354
We're not brothers.
We're not even friends.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.630
Three months ago,
someone tried to kill me.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.917
<i>And when I find out who did this to me,</i>
<i>and I will find out soon,</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:48.310
the sins I commit then
could turn this place to rubble.

<i>Henry David Thoreau once wrote,</i>

01:07.400 --> 01:11.757
<i>"Live each season as it passes,</i>
<i>breathe the air, drink the drink,</i>

01:12.120 --> 01:16.796
<i>"taste the fruit and resign yourself</i>

01:17.760 --> 01:20.354
Well, well, look who's starting a fire.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.990
- Rise and shine.
- Nice of you to knock.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.073
I didn't wanna wake you, Sleeping Bitchy.
Besides, I had to get the list ready.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.276
- What list?
- This list.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.358
What is that exactly?

01:55.360 --> 01:57.999
Since you and I are
both officially available again

01:58.080 --> 01:59.638
and tonight is
the end-of-summer beach party,

01:59.720 --> 02:02.029
which means partial,
if not total naked nudity,

02:02.120 --> 02:05.317
I have made a list of all the available guys,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.437
so that we can avoid the pain and hardship
of another "Lucas love triangle."

02:13.200 --> 02:14.792
Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't get any of that.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.111
Did you just say something
about me puking at a rave?

02:18.320 --> 02:21.551
I said,
"The Lucas you're supposedly dating."

02:21.840 --> 02:23.717
- Non-exclusively.
- Huh.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.268
What "huh"?
I have dated multiple guys before.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.509
Yeah, I know.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.559
In fact, you are the queen
of the multiple-boy dating scenario.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.870
I'm just surprised
you're doing it with Lucas.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.109
Well, you know what they say,

02:35.200 --> 02:37.350
when it comes to boys,
I'm full of surprises.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.715
But I thought you were the new,
responsible Brooke.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.189
So last season.
"Responsible Brooke" is good,

02:42.280 --> 02:44.350
but "Party Brooke" is gooder.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.399
Check it out. I get Lucas, Mouth,
half the guys on the team.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.710
I put my first choices here,
but we can totally mix and match.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.759
Any and all lifeguards.
Nathan's Uncle Cooper. So hot. Larry...

02:55.000 --> 02:57.468
Whoa. Larry, like my dad Larry?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.274
Of course. He's my hot-dad fantasy.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.158
Peyton, he is a total dilf.
And besides, I gave you Dan.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.238
And I get Dave Grohl
from the Foo Fighters.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.036
You get Jake, as promised. Nathan,

03:12.120 --> 03:13.917
but he comes with an asterisk
because nobody knows

03:14.000 --> 03:15.513
what the hell is going on
with him and Haley

03:15.600 --> 03:18.353
in high-school-married limbo.
The other half of the guys on the team.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.159
Anna, because, well, you never know,

03:21.240 --> 03:23.879
and she was totally into you.
And all the river court boys,

03:23.960 --> 03:26.394
- Skills, Fergie and Garbage.
- Junk.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.279
Right. And finally,
the rest of the Foo Fighters.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.351
Why do you get Dave Grohl?
I want Dave Grohl.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.398
- No way!
- So I get a fugitive and a married guy.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.514
Fine. You take Dave Grohl.
I'm taking Anna.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.794
- Deal.
- Deal.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.155
Okay, nighty-night. Thanks, bye.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.956
- You're back.
- Maybe.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.353
Maybe you're just high and seeing things.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.150
So I guess you're still pissed at me,
which, personally, I think is crap.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.676
- But you tell me, are we friends?
- Tell you what,

04:10.240 --> 04:14.074
I'll play you for it. Game to 11.
Make it, take it.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.192
For our friendship.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.708
Game.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.990
- Where are you going?
- You lost.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.510
Guess that means we're still not friends.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.394
Hiya, new roommate.
Getting all moved in?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.548
With the six feet that you gave me,
yeah, sure.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.437
- Good.
- Thank you.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.313
- Hey, great idea.
- What?

06:27.560 --> 06:31.394
Wearing your wedding ring. It's, like,
a total aphrodisiac for some guys.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.955
I just need it to be an aphrodisiac
for one guy.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.874
- Why, do you have a new guy?
- For Nathan, Brooke.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.151
I see. About him,
I notice you haven't unpacked.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.798
- Little naive, don't you think?
- No, no. I'm just stalling.

06:48.880 --> 06:53.510
I mean, it's like, if I unpack,
my split with Nathan will be more real.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.793
I hate to say it,
but it's real enough already.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.313
Yeah, I know.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.155
Okay, no, no, none of that.
Come here, I have a surprise for you.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.549
Come on, come on, this'll be fun.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.109
This is totally gonna cheer you up.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.391
- This is amazing. When did you do this?
- Last night while you were sleeping.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.990
- You totally sleep like a dead person.
- Shut up.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.114
- This looks awesome.
- Thanks.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.229
By the way, I'm kind of gonna need to ask

07:29.320 --> 07:32.153
for next month's rent now,
'cause I sort of spent this month's rent

07:32.240 --> 07:34.196
on the couch and the rugs and things.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.718
Okay. Although, you really shouldn't
have to pay for this stuff yourself.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.279
I mean, we're roommates now. I'll go half.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.395
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.357
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that,
'cause I kind of ate

07:42.440 --> 07:45.591
half your rainbow sherbet last night
while I was hanging the wall mural.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.955
- Where'd you get it, anyway?
- The freezer.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.395
- The wall mural.
- Oh, Peyton made it for me.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.708
It's the French Riviera.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.189
Gosh, I haven't talked to Peyton
in, like, forever.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.953
Lucas filled me in on her mom situation.
What the heck?

07:57.040 --> 07:59.679
Yeah, the mom situation's on high-alert
right now

07:59.760 --> 08:02.911
- 'cause Ellie-Ma's back in town.
- How's Peyton taking it?

08:03.480 --> 08:06.313
Well... There she is now.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.113
She's sending me a last-minute flyer
for the party tonight.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.317
Speaking of which,
you are not allowed to sulk tonight.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.073
- I don't sulk.
- You sulk. You're a sulker.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.432
But tonight, you're gonna have fun.
After all, it's a party.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.512
It's supposed to be... Dark and depressing?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.713
Well, you asked how she's taking it.
There you go.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.669
Hi, Peyton. Last time I saw you,
you were slamming a door in my face.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.194
- So, let's have it.
- What's that?

08:53.680 --> 08:58.276
The heart-wrenching, yet inspirational,
tale of a young girl's complex decision

08:58.360 --> 09:01.158
to part with the daughter
she desperately loves.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.356
Actually, it's not that complex.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.477
At the time I got pregnant,
I liked drugs more than I liked you.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.788
That's it.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.274
I'm a different person now, Peyton.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.637
But those decisions are still mine.
I can't change that.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.838
And what, so you're just coming
to make peace with yourself?

09:23.160 --> 09:24.593
That is so screwed up.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.433
You can't just crawl out of your hole
after 17 years

09:27.520 --> 09:29.556
and cause a plague
like some kind of locust.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.950
For what it's worth,
I crawled out of my hole a long time ago.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.274
Your father wouldn't let me see you.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.192
I don't believe you.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.918
You used to sit under a bridge by the river.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.795
You and a brunette girl

09:47.880 --> 09:51.156
who wore a little too much eye makeup
for a 10-year-old.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.631
She tried to see me! Like seven years ago,
but you sent her away!

10:01.720 --> 10:04.393
- That's right.
- How could you do that?

10:04.480 --> 10:08.109
- Because I'm your dad, and it was my call.
- Unbelievable.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.629
- Peyton.
- Forget it!

10:09.720 --> 10:10.869
Peyton!

10:15.920 --> 10:19.515
Hey! I understand you're upset,
but don't be slamming doors

10:19.600 --> 10:21.636
and stomping your little chicken ass
around this house

10:21.720 --> 10:23.756
while I'm talking with you.
I am still your father.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.149
But you're not my father, are you?

10:32.360 --> 10:35.750
When Ellie gave you up,
she agreed not to see you.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.398
Had your mother lived,
we would have told you.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.948
It would have been up to you.
But when she died,

10:40.040 --> 10:42.838
I decided it would be too hard,
too confusing for you.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.071
- Maybe that was a mistake.
- Maybe it was a mistake.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.512
You know what, Dad? This is you, okay?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.997
Kind of a broken record lately,
don't you think?

10:58.400 --> 11:01.870
You know, Peyton, one of these days,
you're gonna grow up

11:02.280 --> 11:04.669
and you won't have all the answers.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.352
You weren't even 10 years old
when Ellie showed up.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.796
She had a drug habit.
She moved around a lot.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.871
It wasn't even a year
after your mother had died,

11:13.960 --> 11:16.997
and you were
in a pretty rough place emotionally.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.750
And if you ask me, you still are.
And guess what? So am I.

11:23.280 --> 11:27.319
I could not risk exposing you to her.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.510
No way. Not then.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.434
Fine. Fine, not then, okay.
But what about sometime in,

11:34.520 --> 11:36.954
oh, I don't know, the last eight years?

11:37.560 --> 11:41.394
What about then?
Or, like, what about now?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.830
I suppose now is up to you.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.199
- Hey, you.
- Hey back at ya!

12:06.640 --> 12:09.996
1972's outside, it wants its furniture back.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.675
You mock but you don't know.
Try out the couch.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.157
- Nice.
- No. I said,

12:24.240 --> 12:25.878
"Try out the couch."

12:32.240 --> 12:34.834
- I like this couch.
- I thought you would.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.717
Oh, way too early in the day
for me to see this.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.314
Well, what hour would you prefer
to watch us?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.149
How about never o'clock?

12:45.240 --> 12:47.549
Or maybe, I don't know,
quarter after stab-out-my-eyes.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.312
Either one's really good for me.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.709
By the way,
that couch has not been Stainguarded yet.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.268
- You may wanna get a room instead.
- Well, if we get a room,

12:54.360 --> 12:57.033
then you're gonna be stuck
on the stainy couch.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.792
That's a good point.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.319
Give me a minute. We'll go to the beach.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.788
Brooke asked me to help her out.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.713
And by Brooke, you mean
your part-time girlfriend Brooke?

13:14.440 --> 13:16.635
We're gonna set up
for the end-of-summer thing.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.031
What's up with that anyway?

13:19.160 --> 13:22.311
Well, you see,
there's a season called summer, Haley,

13:22.400 --> 13:25.358
and when that ends,
another season called fall starts right up.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.716
Oh, okay, rephrasing. What's up
with the part-time girlfriend stuff?

13:29.680 --> 13:33.195
I don't know yet.
Right now, we're on Brooke's terms.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.555
- But I'll keep you posted.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.518
I also came to check on you.
You know, I was worried about you.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.831
Nathan was in a pretty bad mood
this morning at the river court.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.434
I thought that might have something
to do with you.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.553
Nathan's home?

13:50.240 --> 13:52.549
You didn't know he was back?

13:54.520 --> 13:57.592
No. No, I didn't.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.517
I'm sorry, Haley. I thought you knew.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.318
Can you just tell Brooke
that I'll see her tonight?

14:25.160 --> 14:27.958
Well, well,
if it isn't my beloved daughter-in-law.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.629
Haley, so nice of you to come by
and check on me following my accident.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.995
Oh, by the way,
I think I found a pair of your black gloves.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.274
- Leather, right?
- No.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.715
I don't own any black gloves, Mr. Scott.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.837
I know your parents aren't around,
so call me Dad.

14:45.080 --> 14:49.517
- I'd really just like to see Nathan.
- He didn't tell you he was coming home.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.715
Sometimes I'm so proud of that kid.
Can I fix you a drink?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.674
I hear you rock stars
are big drinkers, right?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.995
Well, suit yourself.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.753
- Deb said you moved out.
- Yeah, sucks, huh?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.912
My marriage is over.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.074
Who knew you and I would have
so much in common after all?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.151
Could you please just tell Nathan
that I'm here?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.832
Oh, he's not home.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.598
- We had an agreement.
- Hi, Larry. Long time.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.035
Not long enough.
You'll forgive me if I skip the love

15:35.120 --> 15:37.634
and go straight
to the "you got a lot of nerve" part.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.188
- Peyton is a real mess right now.
- Well, I'm sorry about that.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.349
You caused it.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.273
No, I think you caused it
by not telling her about me.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.193
Don't even go there, Ellie!
You agreed to stay away.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.236
Yeah. Well, things change!

15:54.440 --> 15:56.078
You have a right to be pissed.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.311
I said I'd stay away,
but my situation has changed,

15:59.520 --> 16:02.080
and now
I would like to get to know Peyton.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.750
With your blessing, of course.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.476
That is not going to happen.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.510
You gave her up.
You have to live with that.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.232
And now, thanks to your change of heart,
so does Peyton.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.832
Stay away from us.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.596
You think this is enough?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.639
For a campfire. Not a bonfire.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.350
I'll get some more
before I pick you up, all right?

16:38.760 --> 16:42.753
I was thinking about riding in with Peyton
and playing the field tonight.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.957
- The field, right.
- We said non-exclusive, Luke.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.190
Yes, I know, but...

16:52.320 --> 16:53.833
Well, I'm not sure
you're gonna be able to handle

16:53.920 --> 16:55.558
this whole non-exclusive thing.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.675
You don't say?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.399
Well, I mean, you know, pretty soon
you're obviously gonna fall for me,

17:00.480 --> 17:02.516
then you're gonna have to break up
with all those other guys,

17:02.600 --> 17:05.272
- and that's just gonna get ugly.
- I see.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.790
Just looking out for you.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.872
Well, thanks, I think I'll be fine.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.757
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.953
Well, since the work's done,
I think I'm gonna go for a little swim.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.877
You wanna come
look out for me some more?

17:27.720 --> 17:30.996
- Sure. I'll catch up.
- Okay.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.149
Hey, what's up, Mom?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.310
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.596
- What does "whoot" mean?
- Whoot?

17:47.680 --> 17:49.238
Yeah, you know, I have this hip new café,

17:49.320 --> 17:51.550
I need to be sure
that my vocabulary is current.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.793
Right. Well, "whoot"
would be like "yahoo."

17:55.240 --> 17:58.357
Okay, so I would go like, "Whoot!"

17:59.040 --> 18:00.712
No, Mom.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.513
You would never go like that,

18:02.600 --> 18:04.158
and as a matter of fact,
never do that again.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.153
But if "whoot" is "yahoo,"
then what is "what-what"?

18:09.560 --> 18:11.915
You wanna know the difference
between "whoot" and "what-what"?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.878
Yeah, you know, like, "What-what!"

18:14.960 --> 18:18.236
Mom, seriously. Never again.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.199
You gotta lay off the hip-hop.
This is Andy's influence, isn't it?

18:25.240 --> 18:27.276
When's he coming back, anyway?

18:27.360 --> 18:29.874
Well, I'm not so sure
that he is coming back.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.873
- Why not?
- Because, Lucas, Andy wanted kids.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.870
He wanted to start a family,
and I'm not sure that I want the same.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.272
Oh, so, what, your first kid was so rotten
that I scared you from trying again?

18:42.360 --> 18:45.955
Essentially, yes, that's it.
Andy's a wonderful guy.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.758
He deserves a family.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.437
- And then there's Keith.
- What about Keith?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.478
Well, I've been thinking about him a lot.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.471
As a matter of fact,
I thought I saw him in town

18:58.560 --> 18:59.959
the day I left for New Zealand.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.077
You know,
the day of the fire at Dan's dealership.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.237
You know, maybe I should go.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.550
I got a lot of errands to run
before this beach party tonight.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.235
End-of-the-summer beach party.
What-what!

19:32.840 --> 19:33.909
Hey.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.318
I saw your car.
I didn't know you were home.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.119
Yeah, I know.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.910
- Did you get the letters I sent?
- Yeah.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.076
- It's good to see you.
- Look, Haley, I can't do this, all right?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.993
What? You can't do what?
You can't talk to me?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.118
You didn't even tell me
you were home, Nathan.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.111
What were you gonna do,
pass me in the hallway at school

20:01.200 --> 20:02.189
and not say a word?

20:02.280 --> 20:05.989
- I didn't even know if you'd be in school.
- I told you, I'm back for good.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.919
Anyway, I don't know if you heard,
but I'm staying in our apartment.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.992
Brooke rented it
and asked me to be her roommate.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.996
- You and Brooke, huh?
- Yeah. I did not see that coming.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.915
Oh, by the way,
if this basketball thing doesn't work out,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.355
you may have a future as a painter.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.673
- Nathan, we have some decisions to make.
- Yeah.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.590
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.789
Well, I guess I'll be at the beach tonight.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.992
There's a party.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.589
Okay.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.237
- You've changed.
- Yeah.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.074
I guess I have you to thank for that.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.313
Okay, not exactly your finest hour
in party attire,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.960
but, who knows, somebody might go
for the homeless-girl look.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.632
You know I don't even wanna go
to this thing.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.915
I know, but because
Mouth is throwing himself

21:51.000 --> 21:52.991
his own personal pity party
over Erica Marsh,

21:53.080 --> 21:55.878
you, P. Sawyer, as you know, are my DJ.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.670
Besides, this is the last
end-of-summer beach party

21:58.760 --> 22:00.034
we're gonna have before we're seniors.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.680
Oh, come on, you know you're gonna have
another chance next year

22:02.760 --> 22:04.512
after you flunk out
and have to repeat a grade.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.751
See, that's the spirit. Sort of.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.359
A little mean, but it's a start.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.908
Speaking of mean,
please don't be to Haley tonight, okay?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.319
Let's party.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.994
Come on.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.399
It's about time.
Can we light the bonfire now?

22:24.480 --> 22:26.516
- Can we? Can we?
- Oh, look, it's Tim.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.068
- I had a dream you died. Darn.
- Look, check it out.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.593
I brought some really cool stuff to burn.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.275
I got cleaning supplies, some army men,
some rotten fruit.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.078
Oh, and there's this dead animal
down the beach

22:36.160 --> 22:37.912
that would burn really cool.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.390
Come to think of it, Tim,
you might burn really cool.

22:41.640 --> 22:45.076
- Let's sacrifice a virgin.
- Sweet. Like who?

22:48.840 --> 22:50.671
Cop! Cop!

22:52.600 --> 22:54.431
Hey, Brooke, what's going on?
You got cups for us?

22:54.520 --> 22:56.511
Sure, boys, right this way.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.358
I'm sorry, I thought they were Five-O.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.557
I'm sure there's still some...

23:46.600 --> 23:50.036
People have had fire rituals
since the beginning of time.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.676
For some people it's witchcraft,
for others, religion,

23:53.760 --> 23:57.878
but for us it marks the beginning
of our senior year!

24:02.520 --> 24:04.670
I know we have to go back to school soon,

24:04.760 --> 24:07.752
but tonight, as long as this fire burns,

24:07.840 --> 24:09.717
summer is still ours.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.674
Look who it is, the kissing bandit.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.149
- Did you fondle anyone while I was away?
- I should apologize.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.715
I won't, but I should.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.917
That kiss was a reckless mistake.
Sort of like Lucas.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.631
- That was a joke.
- Funny.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.714
No wonder you're getting a divorce.
How's that going, by the way?

25:06.840 --> 25:08.910
Why, you ready for round two?

25:10.680 --> 25:13.513
Sorry, I just threw up a little in my mouth.

25:14.040 --> 25:17.555
- Can I just have a coffee, please?
- Sure, just let me spit in it first.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.996
Or maybe you could drug it.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.149
You know, Karen, as I recall,

25:23.240 --> 25:25.674
you were pretty angry with me
the day of the fire.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.992
You know what, Dan?

25:29.080 --> 25:31.116
If you're looking for people
who are pretty angry with you,

25:31.200 --> 25:33.316
you might start at "A" in the phonebook.

25:33.400 --> 25:37.473
You mean "A" as in Andy?
Or maybe "B" as in boozy.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.908
What do we hear from rag doll Keith
these days, anyway?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.958
What are you trying to say?
The fire wasn't an accident?

25:44.040 --> 25:46.554
Why? Is that what you're saying?

25:48.680 --> 25:50.193
You know what?
I think I'm gonna play the old

25:50.280 --> 25:53.238
"right to refuse service" card.
You can get out.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.674
You said I could have a coffee.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.718
Well, let's just call that a reckless mistake.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.314
Fair enough. Say hi to Andy for me.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.432
- That is if you ever see the little guy again.
- You know what?

26:04.520 --> 26:08.035
If someone did try to kill you,
I'm sorry they failed, Dan.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.750
Maybe next time they won't.
Whoever they were.

26:27.680 --> 26:31.116
<i>Who wants to swim with naked Tim?</i>

26:31.200 --> 26:34.510
<i>Who wants to get drunk</i>
<i>and have sex with him?</i>

26:36.160 --> 26:39.118
I know they call it skinny-dipping,
but you wanna try anyway?

26:39.200 --> 26:40.997
I'm pregnant, you idiot.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.078
I'm cool with that.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.594
Hey.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.994
How's that casual dating thing
working out for you?

27:06.280 --> 27:08.953
- So-so.
- Could be worse.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.996
Nathan didn't even show up.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.830
- I don't blame you.
- What's that?

27:29.560 --> 27:32.358
This music.
It's enough to drive anyone to drink.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.553
- Mom stuff?
- I don't know.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.677
I don't feel like I owe Ellie a thing.
You know?

27:39.400 --> 27:42.551
But I still feel guilty sometimes
for freezing her out.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.829
Yeah?

27:43.920 --> 27:47.799
I mean, is trusting someone
always gonna be impossible in my life?

27:48.920 --> 27:51.480
Maybe I should at least try with her.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.430
- I see that look again.
- What look? I don't have a look.

27:56.520 --> 27:59.717
Dude, you've got a tell
the size of J. Lo's ass.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.556
What do you got on Ellie?

28:04.600 --> 28:07.512
Luke, if I'm about to make a huge mistake,

28:07.960 --> 28:10.394
please just help me out.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.873
The thing is

28:16.320 --> 28:18.914
I saw her buying drugs in the park today.
I'm sorry.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.835
Oh, God. You know what?

28:21.920 --> 28:24.718
It makes all the sense in the world,
you know?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.678
She said she was clean,
but so far all she's done is lie anyway.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.034
So...

28:31.160 --> 28:32.752
Is this a funeral?

28:32.840 --> 28:34.353
Will you please play something

28:34.440 --> 28:37.238
that doesn't make me
wanna shoot-up and die?

28:50.120 --> 28:51.439
Thank you.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.713
I need a drink.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.595
If I were looking for a guy
to go skinny-dipping with,

30:00.680 --> 30:02.477
would you be that guy?

30:06.920 --> 30:09.150
Can I be that guy in 20 minutes?

30:10.320 --> 30:13.153
I'll give you 15,
and then I'm going wide with the offer.

30:31.320 --> 30:35.632
- How come you're not at the party?
- How come you're not in the gym?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.919
You know, that little one-on-one game,
that was a joke.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.194
And you better get yourself in shape,

30:41.280 --> 30:44.078
otherwise you're gonna be
completely worthless to me this season,

30:44.160 --> 30:46.958
instead of mostly worthless,
like you are now.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.150
I know why you're here, Nathan.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.073
Haley's not going away, you know?

30:53.160 --> 30:56.152
Dude, for once, could you just mind
your own damn business?

30:56.240 --> 30:59.516
As soon as you forgive her
and try to work things out.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.715
She loves you, Nate.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.995
And is that supposed to make
everything okay?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.193
Yeah, it is.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.872
You're an idiot.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.710
You know something, Nathan?

31:18.520 --> 31:20.112
I've tried with you.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.275
- But sometimes I wonder why I bother.
- Then don't.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.679
Fine! I won't!

31:27.120 --> 31:29.554
You wanna be a coward? Fine.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.677
Stay here and hide. Don't go to the party.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.068
But if you think
I'm gonna let you mistreat Haley,

31:37.760 --> 31:39.193
you're wrong.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.354
Don't try it for a second, because if you do,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.036
I'm gonna hurt you.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.199
Jackass.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.074
Well, at least she won't drown naked.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.315
Hey, Tutor Girl, check it out.
The stars are blue.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.551
- Do your song.
- No, thanks.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.195
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.039
Oh, come on, don't be stuck-up.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.635
- Look, I'll sing the Chris Keller part...
- Tim, I really don't wanna sing.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.756
- Just do it. Please!
- I don't...

33:04.560 --> 33:06.039
Nathan's back.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.076
- Lucas.
- See you.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.197
- Hey.
- You having fun yet?

33:25.880 --> 33:27.598
- Are you?
- Yeah.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.349
You know,
we're never gonna be here again, Luke.

33:31.640 --> 33:35.155
- Senior, summer, you got to enjoy it.
- No, you're right.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.552
We should enjoy it.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.870
Don't you think
that if we're never gonna be here again,

33:39.960 --> 33:42.554
then maybe we should make it
mean something too?

33:42.640 --> 33:46.394
<i>Brooke Davis, do not put your clothes on!</i>

33:50.120 --> 33:51.439
Your calls.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.154
Hey, girly.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.159
I left you like a million messages.
Where you been?

34:07.920 --> 34:09.034
Around.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.989
Drinking, huh?

34:18.080 --> 34:20.547
I should probably join you
with the night I'm having.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.871
It's like, Tim wants me to play.
Nathan won't even talk to me.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.599
Well, it's not like you don't deserve it.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.353
Hey. Can I talk to you?

34:45.960 --> 34:49.475
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
I should have told you I was back in town.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.393
- It's okay.
- Not really.

34:55.239 --> 34:56.275
Look, I've been avoiding you

34:56.360 --> 34:58.590
because I'm still mad, Haley,
about everything.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.633
And I don't see that changing
anytime soon.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.428
You know the last two times
I came to the beach?

35:09.240 --> 35:11.754
For our wedding
and to burn the wedding wall.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.477
So that's what happened to it.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.676
First I broke it in half
with the keyboard I bought you.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.478
And then I burned it.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.199
Sorry.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.240
Nathan, I need to ask you something,

35:25.320 --> 35:28.073
and I really don't want you to take it
the wrong way. But...

35:29.320 --> 35:32.756
I need to know
what you want from me, or from us.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.276
- Where are we now?
- I don't know.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.758
- What do you want us to be?
- I don't know, Haley.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.354
- I can't answer that right now.
- I can.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.190
- I want us to be together.
- Why?

35:50.320 --> 35:52.515
I mean, we're so far away
from who we used to be.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.398
- Why even fight for it?
- Because I love you.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.074
Listen,

36:01.320 --> 36:04.995
basketball season's coming up,
and I'm gonna concentrate on that.

36:05.080 --> 36:09.039
So, you should do your thing,
whatever it is, school, music.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.079
Something other than me.

36:13.360 --> 36:17.239
Because I really don't know
when I'm gonna be ready for us again.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.876
- Or even if I'll be ready for us at all.
- Oh, Nathan, don't say that. God.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.236
Haley, I'm not saying it to be mean, okay?

36:25.400 --> 36:29.279
I don't like hurting you.
I'm just trying to be honest.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.150
I'm gonna head back, all right?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.194
Nathan.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.878
I'm not going anywhere.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.194
Okay.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.957
And then there were two.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.792
Hey, it's not so bad.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.109
This is how we started last school year,
and look how good that turned out.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.718
Let's take a walk.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.195
- What's going on, guys?
- What's up?

37:58.480 --> 38:00.869
- You got a second?
- Sure, what's up?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.273
I'm the guy for you.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.357
I know we're just part-time,
and that's cool.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.154
You know, do whatever, have your fun.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.398
But one of these nights,
you're gonna realize it.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.155
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.319
You'll see.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.877
You guys take it easy.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.400
Here. It used to be my cocaine vial.

39:05.160 --> 39:08.436
Thought you might like it,
considering you were buying drugs today.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.397
It's gonna be okay, Hales.
As a matter of fact,

39:27.320 --> 39:31.199
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.869
Again.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.829
