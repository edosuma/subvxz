00:41.624 --> 00:44.753
Oh, Martha!

00:47.088 --> 00:49.339
I'm sorry.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.217
I believe in you.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.220
I'm sorry.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.815
Come on.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.739
The shadow.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.241
The shadow!

01:17.076 --> 01:18.452
Where'd you find him?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.370
We found him hiding
under the house.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.039
He's not making any sense.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.374
Terry, put the gun away
before you shoot someone.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.959
His name's Charles Winter.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.003
Two kids in the
bedroom, wife outside.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.505
It's not pretty.

01:29.506 --> 01:35.135
Get your fucking hands off me!
Fuck!

01:35.136 --> 01:36.638
Oh, God.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.147
For fuck's sake.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.388
She was pregnant.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.431
Looks like he disemboweled her.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.017
What? Where's the baby?

02:24.018 --> 02:26.855
We can't find it, and
he's not talking.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.235
- Get your bloody...
- Winter.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.028
Hands away.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.655
Eric Hughes, mate.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.366
Where's your baby?

02:39.367 --> 02:42.035
Where's your baby, mate?

02:42.036 --> 02:44.329
Did you try to help her, huh?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.930
Where's your baby?!

02:48.334 --> 02:50.627
Better start praying
for my baby.

02:50.628 --> 02:54.381
I'll tell you where the
baby is, all right?

02:54.382 --> 02:55.884
I'll tell you.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.429
I want your fucking baby!

03:00.430 --> 03:01.848
You fuck!

03:41.846 --> 03:43.805
Hey, honey.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.432
How was your night?

03:47.143 --> 03:49.519
What's the time?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.230
It's about one.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.365
You okay?

04:02.450 --> 04:03.492
Mm.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.912
It was really that bad, huh?

04:07.580 --> 04:08.831
Hey.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.711
We missed you.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.143
Good morning, Helen.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.561
Where are you boys?

04:31.562 --> 04:33.522
Ten minutes from
the Winter home.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.191
You'll have to turn around.
The Winter case can wait.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.567
We've had reports
of a disturbance

04:37.568 --> 04:40.028
at the old midwifery
on Brick Road.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.863
Eric, while you're there,

04:41.864 --> 04:43.744
I think you should check
it out for you and Kat.

04:43.768 --> 04:45.117
It's a lovely building.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.057
Made the big time,
have you, buddy?

05:09.058 --> 05:10.642
Detective Hughes.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.311
No, we're saving for
a deposit, man.

05:13.312 --> 05:16.941
You need a bigger place with
baby Scarlet on the way.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.243
Wow. Look at this place.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.330
Hello. Hello!

05:32.957 --> 05:34.708
Police.

05:34.709 --> 05:35.960
Hello!

05:39.589 --> 05:41.340
Is anyone there?

05:46.262 --> 05:47.346
Hello!

05:59.317 --> 06:01.110
Is anyone here?

06:16.292 --> 06:17.667
Hey!

06:17.668 --> 06:18.711
Ohh!

06:21.672 --> 06:24.091
Good score, but I'm glad
I'm not in your shoes.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.093
Yeah, we got a bit
of work to do.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.844
That place is good.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.013
Yeah. Don't worry, mate.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.058
Me and the boys will
lend you a hand.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.374
Hey, boys, look what I found.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.460
The Brick Road Midwifery
opened in 1949

07:00.461 --> 07:03.505
in the post war baby boom.

07:03.506 --> 07:07.134
You know, half the town was
born there, including me.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.718
Oh, really?

07:08.719 --> 07:10.637
Just before the O'Grady
family took it over.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.598
Winter's baby hasn't been found,

07:13.599 --> 07:15.600
but the courts are
letting us hold him

07:15.601 --> 07:16.852
for further questioning.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.436
Let him sweat. We can wait.

07:18.437 --> 07:21.649
And no, he hasn't
said anything yet.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.652
Thanks, Helen.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.449
Jeez! The one on the left
looks a bit fierce, eh?

07:35.246 --> 07:38.039
I just wish I was
there to support you.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.876
God, Mom, don't cry on me.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.920
Maybe I could just move in with
Eric's parents or something

07:43.921 --> 07:45.213
for a little while.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.798
And then when you
come and visit,

07:46.799 --> 07:48.258
it'll be like Meet the Fockers.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.259
The Fockers?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.886
You know, the movie.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.221
Eric's Dad's so the
De Niro character,

07:53.222 --> 07:55.142
and you're like the crazy
lady with the red hair,

07:55.166 --> 07:56.683
telling everybody
to sing "Kumbaya."

07:56.684 --> 07:57.767
That's enough, seriously.

08:00.479 --> 08:03.356
It's okay. We're gonna be
in our own place soon.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.150
- Oh, are you?
- I promise.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.278
Does that mean you got
the loan approved?

08:08.279 --> 08:10.113
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.574
I'm so excited.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.076
Oh, sweetheart, I
was just thinking.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.705
- If you want me to come out...
- Look, hold on, hold on.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.081
Look, I've got this whole...

08:20.082 --> 08:22.375
Hey, Mom, it's Eric. I gotta go.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.669
You know, I'm just waiting.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.379
Mom, I'm going. I gotta go.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.049
Sweetheart, look, can we
just talk about this?

08:29.050 --> 08:32.219
Gotta go. Bye, bye.
Love you. See ya.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.054
Okay. Look after yourself.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.620
Here we are.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.756
Here, watch your step.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.510
What do you think?

09:13.511 --> 09:15.387
What was this place?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.390
It's an old midwifery.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.573
This will look
amazing, huh, Kat?

09:35.574 --> 09:37.325
I really like this place.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.619
Oh, God, it's gonna look
incredible all cleaned up.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.980
And we got a couple
of guest rooms.

09:41.004 --> 09:43.039
And a cellar.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.708
Yep.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.509
Eric, meet me at yours.
We've got a situation.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.169
Okay, I'll be there in 30.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.505
- On ya mate. Cheers.
- See ya, mate.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.049
Hey, who's that?

09:55.219 --> 09:57.220
I don't know.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.681
I don't wanna get too excited,
in case it can't happen,

09:59.682 --> 10:02.684
but, um, will you
make it happen?

10:37.928 --> 10:40.722
Jesus!

10:40.723 --> 10:41.849
Fuck!

10:43.642 --> 10:45.144
Christ.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.735
Father Joe, you pious prick!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.570
Nice to see you too.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.156
You let them lock me
up for three days

10:58.157 --> 11:00.033
for some trumped-up
loitering charge.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.160
You needed to be taught
a lesson, Linda.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.881
Just get me my bag. I
wanna get out of here.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.747
I don't think so.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.375
The bishop had a meeting
with the probation officer,

11:08.376 --> 11:11.586
and it was decided that
you're to be under my charge.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.380
- What?
- You're gonna have the honor

11:13.381 --> 11:17.675
of being the church caretaker
for the next three months.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.471
Like hell I am.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.099
Linda, if you don't stop,
you'll be back in jail

11:24.100 --> 11:26.101
faster than I can say
three Hail Marys,

11:26.102 --> 11:28.812
and the church will not
support you this time.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.855
Demonology is against the law,

11:30.856 --> 11:34.651
and you're bringing malevolent
spirits into our congregation.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.405
That boy would be dead if it
wasn't for me, and you know it.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.116
Which is why the
church supported you.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.286
Look, your bag is
still in your room,

11:45.287 --> 11:47.539
but you are forbidden to use it.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.835
Those are the church's
rules, Linda.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.373
Hurry up!

12:31.625 --> 12:33.419
Hurry!

12:36.964 --> 12:38.257
Come on!

12:45.598 --> 12:48.434
Shut up. Just shut up. Shh.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.713
Hey, honey.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.745

in that cabinet over there.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.330
Jeez, look at this thing.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.915
They're forceps.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.793
They're for grabbing
a baby's head.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.463
You guys wanna eat?

14:42.464 --> 14:43.631
What is this?

14:43.632 --> 14:45.466
I'm so starved. Come on.

Forty-six, will you get
down to Fowlers Lane?

16:57.307 --> 16:59.225
Apparently a suicide in the barn

16:59.226 --> 17:01.436
at the back of
Harrison's property.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.895
Called paramedics.

It's 146 Fowlers.

Long is at the scene.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.556
Let's take a walk outside.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.059
Deceased is a 19-year-old male
with lacerations to his wrist.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.478
Bled out.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.313
Out the front, I got
a 17-year-old female

17:45.314 --> 17:47.023
with multiple stab
wounds to the abdomen.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.525
There's no sign of a
murder weapon in the barn

17:49.526 --> 17:50.985
or the surrounds.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.487
The girl was hysterical.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.698
Says she was pregnant,
and he killed her baby.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.830

22:57.626 --> 23:00.336
What the...

23:00.337 --> 23:02.089
Is this?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.636
Are you fucking serious?

23:13.350 --> 23:15.435
I told you there was
someone here last night.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.734
What are they doing to us?

23:23.735 --> 23:25.402
Yeah.

23:25.403 --> 23:28.865
Someone playing a sick joke on us.
Fuck!

23:38.500 --> 23:41.085
It's absolutely trashed. Fuck.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.754
I'm gonna call Rob.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.737
Yes?

24:08.738 --> 24:10.322
- Hey, Helen.
- Hi, Eric.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.163
Can I get a tow truck
sent to my house, please?

24:12.187 --> 24:13.742
Kat's car's flipped upside-down.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.537
- What?
- Don't even ask.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.956
How the hell?

24:18.957 --> 24:22.002
There's no footprints. I
didn't hear anything.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.313
Okay. Go get some rest.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.481
Yeah.

24:50.780 --> 24:54.700
Oi, here's some
grub for you, mate.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.536
Boss wants me up on the porch.

24:57.537 --> 24:58.954
Oh, Jesus.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.540
Thanks so much for
doing this, seriously.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.668
- Yeah.
- See you, mate.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.610
- Yeah.
- This food's great, mate.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.196
When's Kat's sister coming out?

25:33.782 --> 25:35.491
She hasn't got a sister, mate.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.118
Cousin?

25:54.135 --> 25:55.804
Ouch.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.440
Kat!

28:15.402 --> 28:16.402
What happened?

28:16.403 --> 28:17.403
She was in here.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.530
Who?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.448
Rob, check around the back!

28:21.449 --> 28:22.574
Who?

28:22.575 --> 28:24.159
There was this nurse.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.078
She came in, she
held her hands out,

28:26.079 --> 28:28.330
she wanted Scarlet.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.874
- A nurse?
- A nurse wanted Scarlet.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.962
Rob, are we clear?

28:34.963 --> 28:36.463
The door's locked.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.382
No, she came in. She
had her hands out.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.092
She wanted our baby.
She wanted our baby.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.218
Honey, honey.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.469
All clear.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.470
She wanted Scarlet.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.472
Honey, honey, honey.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.641
There's no one here.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.310
She wanted Scarlet.

28:50.311 --> 28:54.064
She said, "Give me Scarlet."

28:54.065 --> 28:56.150
Come here. Come here, Kat.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.694
It's okay.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.572
It's okay, Kat.

29:03.002 --> 29:05.242
I'm gonna prescribe
something, which should help.

29:05.243 --> 29:08.663
It'll have a calming affect
and stabilize your moods.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.333
Kat's not normally
a moody person.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.711
It's not uncommon for
women to experience

29:15.712 --> 29:17.629
changes in perceptions.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.882
I mean, you have another
body inside you

29:19.883 --> 29:23.302
and that causes big changes...

29:23.303 --> 29:26.513
And there are other conditions
like puerperal psychosis,

29:26.514 --> 29:29.641
which is rare and
usually postpartum.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.393
Psychosis?

29:31.394 --> 29:34.062
Some others do sometimes
experience transient swings.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.857
Scarlet's mine!

29:36.858 --> 29:39.985
If there is a history in the
family of mental illness

29:39.986 --> 29:43.114
or an underlying
bipolar disorder.

29:46.784 --> 29:47.994
Eric.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.539
They're here.

29:55.043 --> 29:58.629
And, Doctor, will these
drugs harm our baby?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.339
You'll be fine.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.218
They're really safe,
especially at this dosage.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.786
I'll grab some water.
Take a seat, honey.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.507
You okay?

30:45.009 --> 30:46.677
Well, I've gotta go to work,

30:46.678 --> 30:49.764
but I'll be back around 9:00.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.688
Take these pills, okay?

30:59.524 --> 31:02.317
You sure you didn't see
someone last night?

31:02.318 --> 31:03.902
We didn't see
anything last night.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.989
At that window.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.492
No.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.662
We didn't see anyone, honey.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.875
Here.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.762
Were you watching
the whole time?

31:31.723 --> 31:33.140
Hmm.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.852
You'd fallen asleep, hadn't you?

31:43.568 --> 31:45.403
Go to work.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.535
- I'm gonna get some rest.
- Yeah.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.901
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.570
How's the new house?

32:28.571 --> 32:32.824
It's good, it's good. It's big.
We're living in one wing.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.036
Sweetheart, you look tired.
Are you okay?

32:36.037 --> 32:37.454
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.915
Maybe just a little
nervous about the birth.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.416
And Eric's always at work,

32:41.417 --> 32:44.378
and I'm adjusting
to the new home,

32:44.379 --> 32:47.923
but I'm good, I'm good.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.384
Look, you're gonna be
fine, honey, okay?

32:50.385 --> 32:53.595
Get plenty of rest,
and I'm coming over

32:53.596 --> 32:58.266
right after Scarlet's
born to help you, okay?

32:58.267 --> 32:59.936
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.604
Bye!

33:02.605 --> 33:03.898
Bye.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.322
The Lord Jesus Christ,
Redeemer and Savior,

33:12.323 --> 33:13.865
forgive this man his sins

33:13.866 --> 33:15.951
just as you forgave those
who crucified you.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.272
- Let his sorrows be heard...
- What's going on here?

33:18.296 --> 33:21.623
Father, have we got
a confession yet?

33:24.961 --> 33:27.963
Terry, you're welcome
to take a break, mate.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.724
This is the blood
of the covenant

33:29.748 --> 33:31.758
shed for the sins of the many.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.302
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.430
Where's your baby, Winter?

33:36.431 --> 33:40.016
Charles Winter, do
you partake of...

33:40.017 --> 33:41.810
Oh, for fuck's sake!

33:41.811 --> 33:44.730
Father, tell me why this
guy deserves forgiveness.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.023
The Winters are members
of this diocese.

33:47.024 --> 33:50.235
Mr. Winter is entitled
to his religious rights.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.779
Yeah, well, did you ask
where he put his baby?

33:52.780 --> 33:55.866
Eh, Winter?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.242
Where is it?!

33:57.243 --> 33:58.870
Eric, come on.

34:00.371 --> 34:03.874
Detective, how's your baby?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.001
You fuck!

34:10.339 --> 34:12.632
You fucking piece of shit. Fuck!

34:18.097 --> 34:23.518
♪ Hush now, baby
Don't say a word ♪

34:23.518 --> 34:28.190
♪ Mama's gonna buy

34:40.411 --> 34:43.456
I'll say it again.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.757

34:56.260 --> 35:02.891

35:02.892 --> 35:08.231

36:31.814 --> 36:33.232

36:50.374 --> 36:54.669
Hey, I'm trying
to help you, Kat.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.340
I don't want medication.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.636
I don't wanna hurt Scarlet.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.891
It happened again, right?

37:09.060 --> 37:11.311
Kat, I am trying to help you.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.563
I need you to take these pills.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.066
Kat, for one week! Please!

37:16.067 --> 37:18.194
They're real, Eric!

37:20.780 --> 37:23.490
They're real.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.202
Did you take this
out of the trash?

37:28.454 --> 37:29.914
Please.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.255
I don't wanna live
here anymore, Eric.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.387
This place is perfect
for us, Kat.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.790
Scarlet needs me.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.148
Give me Scarlet.

38:39.608 --> 38:43.069
Kat, Kat! Honey,
honey, it's okay.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.863
It was just a dream.
It was a nightmare.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.824
The shadows, they were
digging in Scarlet.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.367
The shadow, did you see it?

38:49.368 --> 38:51.411
It was a nightmare, okay?

38:51.412 --> 38:53.747
The sheet. There was
blood on the sheet.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.041
They pulled the sheet off.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.626
We kicked the sheet off, Kat.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.003
The wall.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.213
- Kat.
- In the wall.

39:02.214 --> 39:05.467
- Hey, come on, darling.
- They came out of the wall.

39:07.261 --> 39:10.680
- Come out of the wall!
- Kat, please, come on, honey.

39:10.681 --> 39:13.601
Come on.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.980
These will help.
Please, darling.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.984
Kat, take your pills, please.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.988
Come on, darling.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.866
Come on.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.920
I told you.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.799
I wanna move out.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.398
Bye, darling.

40:27.341 --> 40:30.135
Hi, guys. This is
my third video.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.719
And the other night,

40:31.720 --> 40:34.305
I was visited again by
these shadow beings.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.391
I wake up at night,
and I can't move.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.352
Just can't move. People
call it sleep paralysis.

40:39.353 --> 40:42.272
I don't know who or what
these things really are.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.150
Maybe they're like
inter-dimensional beings.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.068
Some talk about the
battle between the angels

40:47.069 --> 40:49.404
and fallen angels.

40:49.405 --> 40:52.032
This goes way back in Ephesians.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.579
"For we do not wrestle
against flesh and blood,"

40:57.580 --> 41:00.165
but against the spiritual
forces of evil

41:00.166 --> 41:02.376
"in the heavenly places."

41:04.712 --> 41:07.630
I've also seen these tall,
human-like shadow forms

41:07.631 --> 41:09.340
that can move things.

41:09.341 --> 41:12.927
The worst of these are the
tall ones with red eyes.

41:12.928 --> 41:16.431
They try to take
you, to possess you.

41:16.432 --> 41:19.642
These entities are very real.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.061
Don't ever, don't ever
communicate with these things

41:22.062 --> 41:23.063
without a priest.

42:19.411 --> 42:22.081
It's okay. You're safe here.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.125
I'm Dee.

42:26.126 --> 42:28.503
Katrina.

42:28.504 --> 42:31.005
Hi, Katrina.

42:31.006 --> 42:32.966
Kat.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.593
Hi, Kat.

42:38.180 --> 42:41.849
I didn't know where else to go.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.686
I feel so stupid
even being here.

42:44.687 --> 42:45.771
I know the feeling.

42:50.859 --> 42:54.404
I'm seeing... weird shadows.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.990
Shadow beings.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.327
I-I see this nurse.

43:01.453 --> 43:03.997
She wants to kill my baby.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.541
Can I help?

43:06.542 --> 43:11.337
Um, Kat, this is Father Joe.
He's the priest here.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.464
- Hello.
- This is Katrina.

43:13.465 --> 43:16.927
She's been seeing shadow people.

43:20.889 --> 43:24.100
Katrina...

43:24.101 --> 43:27.145
while I'm sure you're
being completely honest,

43:27.146 --> 43:30.231
but when it comes to
paranormal activity,

43:30.232 --> 43:33.026
the church protocols
are very strict,

43:33.027 --> 43:36.779
so that we can work out
which case is real.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.365
Mm-hmm. Mine's real.

43:39.366 --> 43:41.117
I saw them. They
were in my home.

43:41.118 --> 43:43.661
Of course you did.

43:43.662 --> 43:45.997
You know, there are
thousands of cases,

43:45.998 --> 43:50.418
but only a very small percentage
of them turn out to be for real.

43:50.419 --> 43:55.214
Most of these cases are caused
by abuse of drugs or alcohol

43:55.215 --> 43:57.342
or caused my mental problems.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.177
No, no, I know it sounds crazy.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.055
They flipped my car over.
They rip up my teddy bears,

44:02.056 --> 44:03.776
and at night, they press
down on my stomach.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.350
They're digging for my child.

44:05.351 --> 44:10.356
Katrina, is there a history of
mental illness in your family?

44:11.690 --> 44:13.900
Have you seen a doctor?

44:13.901 --> 44:15.693
Yes.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.530
Has the doctor prescribed
any medication?

44:20.366 --> 44:22.533
Yes, and I stopped taking them.

44:22.534 --> 44:26.662
Katrina, you need to follow
the doctor's instructions,

44:26.663 --> 44:29.624
and then in a week or
two, if necessary,

44:29.625 --> 44:31.167
we can take this
whole thing further.

44:31.168 --> 44:34.045
No! Please.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.048
Please.

44:43.806 --> 44:46.808
Joe, I think she's for real.
Let me help her.

44:46.809 --> 44:49.727
Look, we both have our own ways,

44:49.728 --> 44:52.230
but we're here now
under this same roof,

44:52.231 --> 44:54.148
and we must follow
the church's rules.

44:54.149 --> 44:58.069
Where did the church's rules get Mrs.
Winter and her kids?

44:58.070 --> 45:01.197
You got blood on
your hands, Joe.

45:01.198 --> 45:04.367
Are you for the church,
or are you for God?

45:04.368 --> 45:06.452
They're one and the same.

45:06.453 --> 45:08.997
No, they're not.

46:49.765 --> 46:52.351
There's nothing wrong with me.

46:56.563 --> 46:58.482
Give me the baby.

47:00.275 --> 47:03.736
The child is mine.

47:03.737 --> 47:05.781
The child...

47:23.382 --> 47:25.591
Blessed be thy womb.

47:25.592 --> 47:29.136
Blessed is the fruit thy womb.

47:29.137 --> 47:31.348
The child is mine.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.728
The child is mine.

47:39.022 --> 47:42.149
- The child is mine.
- No!

47:43.569 --> 47:47.071
Blessed is the
fruit of thy womb.

47:47.072 --> 47:49.949
The child!

47:53.203 --> 47:55.454
Blessed is the
fruit of thy womb.

47:55.455 --> 47:57.832
He can be stopped.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.251
Let me look after her.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.044
Okay, okay.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.968
Why won't you leave me?

48:08.969 --> 48:11.721
Why just leave me?

48:11.722 --> 48:15.349
You're really real.
I know you...

48:15.350 --> 48:16.475
You're real.

48:16.476 --> 48:17.769
Stop!

48:20.188 --> 48:22.148
Kat, Kat, hey!

48:22.149 --> 48:23.549
I tried calling you.
Where were you?

48:23.573 --> 48:24.734
I was at the church.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.694
The last thing you need
right now is religion.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.988
I saw the nurse again.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.157
Kat, you need to be taking
your medication, okay?

48:31.158 --> 48:32.758
You remember the last
thing that happened

48:32.782 --> 48:34.410
when Mom didn't take
her medication?

48:34.411 --> 48:37.163
Your mom, Eric, had depression.
That's why she killed herself.

48:37.164 --> 48:40.751
It had nothing to do with
what the church said!

48:43.587 --> 48:45.172
Kat. Kat!

48:46.340 --> 48:48.341
I spoke to Doctor Khoen.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.510
She's referring you
to a psychiatrist.

48:53.555 --> 48:56.308
And she wants you to think
about going to a clinic.

48:57.309 --> 48:59.645
What, have me admitted?

49:04.232 --> 49:07.109
I'm not fucking crazy!

49:07.110 --> 49:10.072
I'm not crazy!

49:16.328 --> 49:18.747
I'm not crazy.

49:30.842 --> 49:34.012
Why won't you believe me?

49:35.514 --> 49:37.474
Because you have a condition.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.562
Fuck you.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.922
What are you praying for?

50:13.635 --> 50:15.637
To be shown the way.

50:16.930 --> 50:19.265
You know the way.

50:19.266 --> 50:23.060
A spiritual battle must be
fought with spiritual weapons.

50:23.061 --> 50:25.980
We're at war, Joe,

50:25.981 --> 50:29.483
and our enemy doesn't
play by the rules.

50:29.484 --> 50:33.863
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to do anymore, man.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.906
It's exactly like
it was with Mom.

50:35.907 --> 50:37.825
Yeah, look.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.327
It must be tough. I
don't know what to say.

50:40.328 --> 50:43.164
Just look after her
and be there for her.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.166
- Okay.
- All right, mate.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.669
- I'll catch you tomorrow.
- I'll see you in the morning.

51:24.498 --> 51:26.041
Kat!

51:29.377 --> 51:31.378
Kat! Kat!

51:31.379 --> 51:32.630
- Come on!
- Eric!

51:32.631 --> 51:33.882
Let's go!

51:54.277 --> 51:57.071
Father!

51:57.072 --> 51:59.490
Ah, the detective.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.075
I'm sorry. I didn't
catch your name.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.326
Eric Hughes.

52:02.327 --> 52:04.161
My wife came in here earlier

52:04.162 --> 52:05.955
and asked for help, and
you turned her away.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.414
Why?

52:07.415 --> 52:09.750
As I explained to Katrina,

52:09.751 --> 52:13.003
we cannot jump every time
a person imagines they...

52:13.004 --> 52:15.089
I didn't believe Kat either,

52:15.090 --> 52:18.801
but I'm seeing things
that I can't explain.

52:18.802 --> 52:22.429
Please, sir.

52:22.430 --> 52:24.598
Dreadful mistakes can happen

52:24.599 --> 52:27.852
when one does not
follow church protocol.

52:27.853 --> 52:30.855
I once mistook a case
of schizophrenia

52:30.856 --> 52:32.857
for demonic possession,

52:32.858 --> 52:36.986
and I will never let
that happen again.

52:36.987 --> 52:40.781
- I need proof, Detective.
- Proof?

52:40.782 --> 52:44.201
I'm your proof. I'm going crazy.

52:44.202 --> 52:46.078
I don't know what to do.

52:46.079 --> 52:49.790
Joe, please! Come on!

52:49.791 --> 52:52.001
They need help. Not next week.
Now!

52:52.002 --> 52:53.711
That's enough, Linda.

52:53.712 --> 52:55.921
I can help you. I'll get my bag.

52:55.922 --> 52:57.882
Kat, we're going to the house.

52:57.883 --> 53:00.467
No, I'm not going
back to that house.

53:00.468 --> 53:02.469
- You have to.
- Linda!

53:02.470 --> 53:04.680
It started there. It
has to end there.

53:04.681 --> 53:08.767
The well-being of your wife
is in your hands, Mr. Hughes.

53:08.768 --> 53:10.352
Do I make myself clear?

53:10.353 --> 53:13.732
You make yourself clear.
Come on.

53:48.141 --> 53:50.185
I'm so sorry that I
didn't believe you.

53:58.401 --> 53:59.736
Are you okay?

54:04.115 --> 54:05.867
Let's go inside.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.745
No, no.

54:09.746 --> 54:12.457
They're following me.

54:14.167 --> 54:16.794
Kat, I love you.

54:16.795 --> 54:20.507
Okay, whatever they are,
let's face them together.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.467
This place...

54:23.468 --> 54:25.720
has a dark history.

54:30.058 --> 54:32.185
Just leave the
lights for a moment.

54:34.771 --> 54:39.401
Whatever it is here,
it's extremely powerful.

54:50.787 --> 54:53.372
But why do they wanna hurt me?

54:53.373 --> 54:56.875
Oh, they don't wanna hurt you.

54:56.876 --> 54:58.919
They wanna kill you

54:58.920 --> 55:01.256
and kill your baby.

55:03.341 --> 55:06.051
- We can just move.
- It's not that simple.

55:06.052 --> 55:10.764
Shadow people don't exist in
time and space as we know it.

55:10.765 --> 55:16.186
And they're on the
hunt for souls,

55:16.187 --> 55:19.232
and they're focused on Scarlet.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.618
Well, how do we get rid of them?

55:31.619 --> 55:35.914
With rituals of
prayer, cleansing,

55:35.915 --> 55:38.543
and the help of the archangels.

55:41.254 --> 55:44.089
If you want me to continue, I
need your permission first.

55:44.090 --> 55:45.467
Yes.

56:01.316 --> 56:05.695
Dear God, guard us with
the light of your love.

56:07.781 --> 56:10.157
Protect us.

56:10.158 --> 56:12.368
Now and evermore.

56:14.704 --> 56:16.456
Amen.

56:19.626 --> 56:23.587
If anything happens or
appears, just keep still.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.506
Do nothing.

56:25.507 --> 56:28.218
It's gonna be okay.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.408
Dee.

56:59.040 --> 57:01.459
Scarlet!

57:04.754 --> 57:05.797
What the fuck?

57:07.590 --> 57:09.716
Scarlet needs me.

57:09.717 --> 57:11.468
In the name of God Almighty,

57:11.469 --> 57:13.389
I command you to leave
this woman and this child.

57:13.413 --> 57:15.389
Scarlet needs me!

57:15.390 --> 57:17.517
Give me your name.

57:20.395 --> 57:23.481
Give me your name.
Reveal yourself!

57:29.612 --> 57:31.281
Kat.

57:45.336 --> 57:48.755
A...

57:48.756 --> 57:51.383
D...

57:51.384 --> 57:52.426
A.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.679
- Ada.
- Ada? Ada.

58:03.229 --> 58:04.814
Eric?

58:06.482 --> 58:08.609
Eric. Eric!

58:08.610 --> 58:10.861
Morning.

58:10.862 --> 58:13.031
Come sit down.

58:15.116 --> 58:18.453
- Oh, thank goodness.
- How'd you sleep, sweetheart?

58:20.538 --> 58:23.665
Do you remember last night?

58:23.666 --> 58:24.917
Uh, no.

58:24.918 --> 58:27.169
You were out to it.

58:27.170 --> 58:28.962
Take a look at this.

58:28.963 --> 58:32.008
Yeah, we've done some research.
Her name's Ada Horrace.

58:33.593 --> 58:36.220
She's the one holding the baby.

58:36.221 --> 58:38.472
That's her.

58:38.473 --> 58:41.391
She was in charge of
the midwifery in '55.

58:41.392 --> 58:44.102
And she was charged with
murdering four babies

58:44.103 --> 58:46.897
in her care.

58:46.898 --> 58:49.233
That's why she wants Scarlet.

58:49.234 --> 58:52.694
Yep, and that's why we
need to find the bitch.

58:52.695 --> 58:54.696
How do we get rid of her?

58:54.697 --> 58:56.949
Well, now that we've
found out who she was,

58:56.950 --> 59:01.620
we just need to find her grave,
burn her bones, and it's over.

59:01.621 --> 59:03.121
We're gonna go meet Rob

59:03.122 --> 59:05.290
because he might know
where she was buried.

59:05.291 --> 59:07.918
Well, I'm coming.

59:07.919 --> 59:10.755
I'm staying with you
until she's gone.

59:27.021 --> 59:30.983
Why would Ada Horrace
murder those children?

59:30.984 --> 59:33.527
She must have made a
pact with the devil,

59:33.528 --> 59:36.155
and that was his asking price.

59:38.616 --> 59:42.244
There's a war going on.
A battle for souls.

59:42.245 --> 59:44.330
And it doesn't get
more pure than a baby.

59:48.167 --> 59:51.004
How do you know so much
about all of this?

59:54.215 --> 59:57.217
When I was 14, my Dad died,

59:57.218 --> 01:00:00.470
and I went off the rails a bit.

01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:03.765
Got involved with this carnival,

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:08.563
and inside, it was
a Satanic cult.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.191
I was the fly for their spider.

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.696
What's she doing here?

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.657
Mate, she's here to help.

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:23.118
You shouldn't be messing
around with this stuff.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.998
You got 20 minutes,
then she's gotta go.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.756
Ada Horrace's file.

01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:45.558
What do you reckon, Dee?

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:49.227
That's her.

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:51.064
Some photos.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:55.400
- Hmm.
- What have you found?

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:57.862
"Andrew Winter, 1956."

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.239
Winter.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.617
I wonder if he's
related to our Winter.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:04.911
Hmm.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:12.167
Okay, the postmortem report.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.503
Lacerations to the hand.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.129
Let's have a look.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.215
To the face.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.218
And the feet.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.011
Jesus.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:25.764
Rob, you should see these.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.808
Can I show these to Father Joe?

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.977
No. They're still
police evidence.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:39.444
Get this. The townsfolk
destroyed Ada's grave,

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:42.072
and her body went missing.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:45.617
If she doesn't have
a grave or a body,

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:47.703
how do we find her?

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:52.707
I think I might know
someone who'll know.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.418
♪♪

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.502
Are you okay?

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:58.004
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:00.882
Okay, Winter, you
got some visitors.

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:03.718
Guys, you got five
minutes down here.

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.596
Winter.

01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:08.765
Have you got a father
called Andrew?

01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:11.810
Ah...

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.813
Where was he born?

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:19.693
I know who you are, Eric.

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:24.281
We're the same, you and I.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.950
No, we're not.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.913
I'm now talking to Mr. Winter.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.583
Mr. Winter, do you know where
Ada Horrace was buried?

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.502
Why do you call me
this mortal's name?

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:39.463
Don't play games with me.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:42.132
Ask me instead.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.758
You won't tell me the truth.

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:48.597
But you won't understand
because you're human.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.809
Whoever we're talking
to, it's not him.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:56.063
Charles Winter is gone.

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:01.651
That baby's mine.

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:02.694
You fuck!

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:04.113
That's enough. Let's go.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:09.034
- Kat!
- You'll never have my daughter.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.161
- Kat.
- Hello, Katrina.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:13.915
Mr. Winter.

01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:21.546
I know you never wanted
to hurt your family.

01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:23.216
Hmm?

01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:32.558
And I know you truly loved them.

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:39.106
I'll pray for you and your
soul and your family.

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.778
Will you pray with me?

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:46.822
I'll try.

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:50.534
No one can hear me.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.661
I hear you.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.998
I hear you right now.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.085
My name's Charlie.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.836
You're Charlie.

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:04.339
Yeah.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.258
Hi, Charlie.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.010
Hi.

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:12.180
I'm sorry.

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.140
I know.

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:20.146
Oh, God. Someone's coming.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:21.815
It's okay.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.400
He's coming back.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.987
Who's coming? Who's coming back?

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:29.155
It is Ada?

01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:31.157
Ada. We wanna know about Ada.

01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:33.786
Do you know where
Ada was buried?

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.496
Where is she buried?

01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:39.166
She never left the house.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.713
The baby's mine!

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.841
- Get off of her!
- Eric!

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.845
You joining the dots, Detective?

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:54.515
I'll have you, Winter!

01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:02.647
It's getting colder.

01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:06.610
She's buried down here.
I can feel it.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:08.278
Watch your step.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:09.947
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:58.871
There she is.

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:03.166
All right, Ada.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:06.294
Let's get you out.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.005
Give me a hand.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.635
Yeah, that's it.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.272
Gently does it.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.194
It's okay, Kat.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.663
Leave her.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:51.172
Dear God, seal this
room and everyone in it

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.757
in Your precious light.

01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:56.511
Show yourself, spirit
of Ada Horrace,

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:59.223
so that you may be judged
by our Heavenly Father.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.524
In the name of my
Lord and Savior,

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.151
the almighty and
everlasting God,

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:14.487
I command you to reveal
yourself, Ada Horrace.

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:17.825
I was called. Give me Scarlet.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.578
Stay away from me!

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:24.164
In the name of God,

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:27.667
I break and dissolve all
curses, lies, deceptions

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:29.294
and sever all Satanic vows.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.795
Give me Scarlet.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:33.298
I can look after her.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:35.258
I can look after the little one.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:36.885
Let me protect her.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:40.638
By the power of God, I command
you to leave this house.

01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:43.183
- You know not what you do.
- Leave this child

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:44.225
for all of time.

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:16.466
We can't thank you
enough, really.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.966
Ada was nothing.

01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:20.511
Now I've gotta face the
wrath of Uncle Joe.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.263
Father Joe is your Uncle?

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:25.058
Yeah. We drive each other crazy,

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.103
but we're the only
family we've got.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.397
Well, thank you.

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:44.118
I'll call you later, okay?

01:08:44.118 --> 01:08:46.622
It's okay. I'll be fine.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:50.082
Hi, Kat.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.709
You okay?

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.046
I'll tell you in the car.

01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:08.036
So... the holy warrior
has returned.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.830
Well, someone had
to defend them.

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:11.874
Hmmph.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.963
Where did you get these?

01:10:18.964 --> 01:10:21.550
Yeah, I wanted you to
have a look at those.

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.555
Who's this woman?

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.849
Her name's Ada Horrace.
She was a midwife,

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:33.770
and she killed four
babies at the midwifery,

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:37.190
and she killed herself.

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.610
Get me my magnifying glass.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:22.026
I sent the medics down to
Winter's cell already.

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:23.861
You all right, Terry?

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:25.697
I'm not sure this
job's for me, mate.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:28.032
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Come on.

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.369
Oh, my God.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.668
Oh, fuck.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.547
Fucking brilliant.

01:11:42.756 --> 01:11:44.757
How the fuck did this happen?

01:11:44.758 --> 01:11:46.844
Jesus Christ.

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:52.682
That's no suicide.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:56.102
That looks like a stigmata.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:12:00.106
And stigmata is the sign
of saintliness from God.

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:03.359
I don't think this woman
murdered those babies.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.737
I think she was
trying to save them.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:09.449
Stigmata is a symbol
of protection.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.868
It looks as though she
was trying to write

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:15.204
something on the wall.

01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:18.917
The name of a demon.

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:24.506
Baal.

01:12:32.639 --> 01:12:34.016
Oh, fuck.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:44.817
Baal was a demon god
linked to other demons.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:47.612
Baal Moloch and Baal Harmon.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:51.115
Baal had a very powerful hold
over the Mesopotamian people,

01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:55.662
and they sacrificed their
firstborns to him,

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.791
Which is why he's attached
himself to the house,

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.086
to the midwifery.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:06.297
Somehow the presence
of this pregnant woman

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:09.050
has brought Baal back.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.094
- And Ada came...
- She is the protector.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:13.222
As the protector.

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:18.559
Baal controlled legions
of shadow people.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.521
He's been around for
millennia, and he is real.

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.815
He's always been real.

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:27.402
Baal is also known
as the Hat Man.

01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:42.291
- Yeah?
- Eric.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:46.129
Eric, get back to the house now.
Hurry. She's not safe.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:49.174
Shit. Hey, we've gotta go. Now.

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.315
Kat's not picking up. Come on.

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:14.032
Don't do this, Dee.
He's too powerful.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.870
Oh, my child.

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:33.946
Your baby Scarlet is mine.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.708
Crystal Springs 100, this
is Detective Hughes.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.876
151 Old Brick Road,
requesting backup.

01:16:30.877 --> 01:16:32.128
Copy that. On their way.

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:33.587
Slow down, slow down.

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:36.257
Did you see that?

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.718
What the fuck is that?

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:41.345
I don't know.

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:43.347
But Kat's in there somewhere.

01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:44.850
I'm going in.

01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:54.609
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Come on, Rob!

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:05.537
Kat?

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:18.884
Kat!

01:17:22.262 --> 01:17:24.555
Where are you?

01:17:24.556 --> 01:17:26.015
Kat!

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:27.434
Where are you?

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.191
Where are you?

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.446
Jesus.

01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:43.491
Can't find her.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.077
They're fucking everywhere.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.020
There's one place
we haven't looked.

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.509
Kat! Oh, my God, Kat.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.135
Kat, Kat!

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:05.137
Kat, look at me.

01:18:05.138 --> 01:18:06.722
Why isn't she moving?

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.557
I don't know.

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:11.811
What is that?

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:14.480
Oh, God.

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:18.568
What the hell is that?

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:21.571
Fuck.

01:18:31.331 --> 01:18:33.125
Rob! Rob!

01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:39.338
As God arises, enemies
be scattered.

01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:42.926
I call upon Archangel
Michael to come to our aid.

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:47.263
Dee, what do we do?

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:49.683
There's candles in there.
Light them up.

01:18:51.017 --> 01:18:52.643
It's okay, honey.

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.397
It's okay, Kat.

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.399
Dee, can we move her?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.568
No, we can't move her until
the paralysis is lifted.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.489
- It could kill them both.
- Well, what do we do?

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.495
The light of God surrounds you.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.415
The love of God protects you.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.918
And wherever you are, God is.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.760
That's pissing him off.

01:19:26.761 --> 01:19:28.512
Good.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.975
Bless you, Kat. Stay strong.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.438
In the name of Our Father,

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:41.276
I command you, Baal, to
reveal yourself to God.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.874
Damned soul.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.792
- I'm his warrior.
- Fool!

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.713
Lord, protect this unborn
soul from the darkness.

01:20:00.737 --> 01:20:05.132
You do not intimidate me
with your whimsical faith.

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:09.136
Does thy behold Ada as
conclusion of this nightmare?

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:12.264
You belong in the lake
of fire, fallen angel.

01:20:12.265 --> 01:20:15.518
Ada was your only fortification.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:19.063
She understood
that her sacrifice

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:21.106
was the only way to control me.

01:20:21.107 --> 01:20:23.943
I command you, Baal,
to leave this woman.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:25.194
Leave this child!

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:26.655
You command nothing!

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.039
I will take you all!

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.500
No!

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.336
Dee!

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.221
Rob!

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:54.848
Fight it! Fight it!

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.892
Do not look at him!

01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:59.103
Look at me, Rob!

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.604
No! No!

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.315
Look at me!

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.609
No!

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:09.113
No! Fuck!

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.991
Rob, Rob.

01:21:22.335 --> 01:21:25.713
Give me the child now...

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.965
and all this will end.

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:31.844
You will never have my daughter.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.973
E tae Baal Beruth.

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.976
- Joseph.
- Spiritus Dae...

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.144
Finally.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:41.854
Fecit Mae!

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:44.231
E tabernaculum altisimi.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:48.485
Protegaea hac puela,
istam illuminae due.

01:21:48.486 --> 01:21:52.239
Damnite, le fortitudinem leonis,

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.908
huc colubrum ocidere.

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:58.912
En nomeinae padre, et fili,
et spiritus sanctus.

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:03.626
Hac puela, relinque
ego pravido dues.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:06.629
I'm the alpha and the omega,

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:09.298
the first and the last,

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:12.509
and I will be the end!

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:13.719
No!

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.472
I am...

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:19.099
Baal!

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.185
You cannot destroy me!

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.770
The child is mine.

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:27.358
The child's soul is mine.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:31.320
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:34.323
I command you!

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:35.659
Leave this child!

01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:38.243
Kat, Kat.

01:22:38.244 --> 01:22:41.455
This child belongs to God!

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.291
No!

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:47.878
Hac puella, est in Deus.

01:22:47.879 --> 01:22:50.048
Benedictus Dae.

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:01.642
Kat!

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:07.524
En nomeinae padre, et fili,
et spiritus sanctus!

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.487
- Ahh!
- Yeah!

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:27.167
Eco preacipio vobis,

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.461
en nominae Christi.

01:24:02.328 --> 01:24:03.871
Eric Hughes,

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:07.332
you have been found guilty
by a jury of your peers

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:10.128
of four counts of murder.

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:15.424
Considering you have
shown no remorse,

01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:18.010
I have no option but
to sentence you

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:19.511
to life imprisonment,

01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:22.390
without any possibility
of parole.
