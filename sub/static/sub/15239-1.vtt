01:24.400 --> 01:25.900
"Take It To The Limit"?

01:28.700 --> 01:29.700
Artist and year?

01:33.400 --> 01:36.900
1 975. The Eagles, of course.
Very funny.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.800
That´s not a song. It´s ridiculous.
You made it up.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.600
That is definitely a song.
It´s a good song, and a winning song.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.400
You give up?

02:26.700 --> 02:28.000
On belay.

02:29.700 --> 02:33.200
"MacArthur Park." Richard Harris.
1 968.

02:33.800 --> 02:38.100
1 968? I didn´t even think they had
recorded music back then.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.200
Excuse me. I have a signed album
by Mr. Harris.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.500
It was cutting-edge stuff back then.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.400
Peter, check your sister´s belay.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.800
Want to tell him we´re not 1 5?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.500
Why bother? We´ll always be 1 5.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.200
Dad, she needs a second cam.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.000
That won´t hold in a fall.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.100
Screw you.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.400
Listen, Annie.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.600
No matter how experienced...

03:00.900 --> 03:03.800
...a smart climber always wears a belt
and suspenders.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.100
Two cams are safe, three´s better.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.300
I´m not kidding. We´re not moving
until you put another cam in the wall.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.100
I have three cams.
He´s yanking your chain.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.000
Watch out!

03:18.100 --> 03:20.800
Amateurs at twelve o´clock!
Check your safety!

03:48.100 --> 03:49.900
Too much weight!
It´s not gonna hold!

03:53.800 --> 03:55.500
Hold it together, you two!

03:55.700 --> 03:56.900
Now get a grip.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.900
We´re getting out of this.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.100
Annie, how close to the wall are we?

04:04.600 --> 04:08.400
Keep still, goddamn it!
Stop moving around! Stop!

04:10.900 --> 04:11.600
Dad!

04:24.600 --> 04:25.900
Both of you...

04:26.400 --> 04:28.000
...keep very still.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.700
Try and stay calm.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.400
Annie.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.400
Is the other cam moving?

04:34.800 --> 04:35.800
No.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.800
Try and reach the wall.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.700
See if you can anchor us back in.

04:41.700 --> 04:42.900
Try it.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.300
It´s moving!

05:17.200 --> 05:18.500
Peter, get your knife.

05:18.700 --> 05:19.500
What?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.000
Just do as I say.

05:21.900 --> 05:22.700
Get it!

05:23.500 --> 05:25.500
You don´t have much time here.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.800
You have to do something for me.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.700
Cut me loose.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.000
One cam can´t hold us all.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.800
You have to cut me loose...

05:36.100 --> 05:39.100
...or else I´ll pull everybody down.
Everybody will die!

05:39.800 --> 05:40.700
Shut up, Annie!

05:40.900 --> 05:42.900
It´s one dead or three, Peter.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.500
Don´t make him do this.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.500
You´re gonna kill your sister.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.500
Annie will die if you don´t.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.300
-I won´t do it!
-Cut the rope!

05:50.600 --> 05:51.900
-I can´t!
-Stop it!

05:52.100 --> 05:55.400
That cam is gonna come out
and Annie and you will die!

05:55.600 --> 05:58.000
-You´ll kill your sister!
-Stop it!

05:58.700 --> 06:00.400
Cut the damn rope!

06:01.200 --> 06:03.300
It doesn´t matter about me. Cut it.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
We´re out of time!

06:04.700 --> 06:05.800
Don´t do it!

06:06.300 --> 06:09.200
No one will blame you for it!
Just cut it!

06:10.700 --> 06:13.800
Annie and you are gonna die!
Just cut it, Peter!

08:51.000 --> 08:54.300
We´re cleared for the Siachen glacier.
A doctor´s on standby.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.200
I was heading there anyway.
Mail and supplies.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.600
I can drop you on my way back
to K2 base camp.

08:59.900 --> 09:00.700
Sounds good.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.800
I tried to visit you a few days ago.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.800
But the weather closed in.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.100
Annie´s at base camp.
Arrived last week.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.400
Would you like a tea?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.000
No, I´m fine.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.700
You must try the tea. It´s very good.
Indian, of course.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.900
We may be at war with them,
but their tea´s the best.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.800
-Forgive me. Mr. Garrett, isn´t it?
-Yes.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.100
National Geographic is always welcome.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.700
The only Westerners who come to
Pakistan without conquering something.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.200
The colonel´s angry. Only 25 % of his
medical supplies are onboard.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.000
And three days late.
Look at this place.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.800
In six years, I´ve lost 800 men.
Not one to the enemy.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.100
But the chopper was full of stuff.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.000
Not for my men.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.800
For Americans who can pay $3 million for
climbing permits.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.800
Elliot Vaughn, the entrepreneur.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.500
He´s got 40 people with him to try K2.
I´ve been seconded to his team.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.900
Seconded or sold?

11:16.900 --> 11:20.900
That´s a question only a general
in Islamabad can answer.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.600
Three o´clock.
Time to wake up the Indians.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.500
So Annie´s coming in
with Vaughn´s team?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.100
She´s leading a WNN documentary crew.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.300
They´re going up the mountain
with him.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.800
Have you seen her?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.800
Not yet. One of the guides told me.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
What about Vaughn?
What´s he all about?

11:57.400 --> 12:01.700
Pretty much what you´d expect.
Sensitive, kind, modest.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.700
Your typical billionaire.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.200
Four years ago his team took
on the south face.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.900
Was 800 feet from the top
when weather closed in.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.700
Twenty-four hours in the death zone.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.700
Next morning, he walked down.
He´s a bloody good climber.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.700
-Got your update, Annie.
-What´s up?

13:03.900 --> 13:06.100
That cyclone´s tracking fast
from southeast.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.300
Let me know if anything changes.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.300
What are you--?

13:39.600 --> 13:42.000
I just happened to be in the area.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.300
I heard WNN hired you. And you´re
hosting it. Congrats.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.000
They needed someone who could climb K2
and look presentable.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.300
Not much of a rush.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.100
That´s not true. They wanted the best.

14:00.200 --> 14:04.100
I read about you on the Eiger.
Fastest female ascent.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.100
Dad would be proud.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.500
When you leaving?

14:25.700 --> 14:29.900
Early tomorrow morning. We want to
be summiting by 2:00 Wednesday.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.000
What does the mountain say about that?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.600
I thought you laid siege to it.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.200
I didn´t know it could be scheduled.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.700
It´s a plan, Peter, that´s all.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.700
Vaughn´s aggressive. He knows what he
wants and goes for it.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.400
I admire him.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.700
How long have you known him?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.100
Wherever you´re going with this,
you´re wrong.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.200
Nobody ever affects my climbing.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.400
Was that two of them, Cyril?

16:08.600 --> 16:11.700
Or has this stuff just gotten
better than we thought?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.700
-Frank.
-Good to see you.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.700
-Tommy McLaren. Colorado Kid.
-You ready to go?

16:46.900 --> 16:48.300
You lead, I´ll follow.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.600
There´s my leading lady. Hi, Annie.

16:50.900 --> 16:53.500
-How was your trip?
-My stomach´s still up there.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.700
Luckily I passed on the eggs Benedict.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.800
Excuse me for a minute.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.600
Ed Viesturs.
It´s an honor to meet you.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.300
-Elliot Vaughn.
-Nice to meet you.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.300
This guy has been up Everest five times.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.800
He´s climbed 1 2 of the world´s
1 4 highest peaks.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.800
All without oxygen.

17:14.099 --> 17:18.599
Rock on. By comparison, all of us
are merely amateurs.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.200
-It´s a real honor, Ed.
-Welcome to base camp.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
Thank you.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.100
outdoors magazine wants
to interview you.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.800
"Bankruptcy at High Altitude."

17:38.800 --> 17:40.100
How much can we--

17:43.300 --> 17:44.200
Yes?

17:47.100 --> 17:50.400
I could go and come back, or....

17:56.400 --> 17:57.700
Looking for Skip?

17:58.800 --> 17:59.900
Yeah.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.000
Try the command tent.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.000
Thanks.

18:13.700 --> 18:14.800
Skip?

18:15.400 --> 18:16.800
I´m Peter Garrett.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.800
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.000
I got your message.
Bad luck about your porter.

18:22.300 --> 18:26.100
I´ve got four you can meet tomorrow.
Supplies you need are no problem.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.200
The Swedish hooker´s taking longer
than I thought.

18:29.500 --> 18:33.700
There´s no shortage of entertainment.
You saw Mr. Vaughn fly in?

18:34.000 --> 18:38.500
He´s hard to miss. What´s this
about his climbing to a deadline?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.700
-Friend of yours?
-My sister´s climbing with him.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.800
Annie Garrett.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.600
Vaughn´s got this publicity stunt
for his new airline, Majestic Air.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.300
He stands on the top of K2 waving
as the inaugural flight goes overhead.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.600
Are you serious?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.200
I´m deadly serious.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.700
Your sister´s safe. No one knows
these hills better than Tommy McLaren.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.100
He told Vaughn they´d get up there.
I know I did.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.000
I´d have told him anything
for $1 million.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.700
Is that what he´s spending?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.500
That´s just for Tom. Bought his
company out for the entire season.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.300
Not that I´m pissed off.
Look what I get to drag to the top.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.600
56-year-old movie producer
with dysfunctional bowel syndrome.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.700
He´s got the runs, mate. Permanently.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.800
The Bench brothers bet
he won´t make it past 1 8,000.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.000
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

19:34.200 --> 19:38.800
It depends. I´m so broke I might have
to shove him in a crevasse myself.

19:39.300 --> 19:43.600
This is Monique, our base camp manager
and medic. Monique, Peter.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.800
We´ve met. You should look at these.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.500
Don´t mind her. She´s French-Canadian.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.700
Some days she´s Canadian
and can be quite pleasant.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.900
Today, she´s obviously French.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.000
How about some Spanish mackerel
for the bow?

20:23.200 --> 20:26.900
My name´s Cyril. I´m not much,
but I´m all I think about.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.900
Watch out for him, he´s like a dog.
If he sees something...

20:30.200 --> 20:33.900
...he tries to shag it. If he can´t
shag it, he tries to eat it.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.100
If he can´t eat it, he pisses on it.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.400
It´s easy to tell us apart,
because I´m the shy one.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.400
No, no, no, seňorita.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.000
Here you go.
Have a drink on Mr. Vaughn.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.000
What time´s the laser show?

20:56.100 --> 20:57.600
Is this thing on?

20:58.100 --> 20:59.400
Howdy!

21:01.600 --> 21:03.200
Everyone hear me all right?

21:03.500 --> 21:05.000
No!

21:07.800 --> 21:09.400
You´re the lucky ones.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.400
Welcome to the highest party
in the world!

21:19.100 --> 21:21.900
Okay, maybe I did overdo it
just a bit.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.200
Four years ago, I came here
with a dream to climb K2.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.700
The toughest mountain in the world.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.200
As most of you know,
that attempt ended in tragedy.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.800
On Wednesday,
with the help of Tom McLaren...

21:38.200 --> 21:40.700
...I intend to fulfill that dream.

21:40.900 --> 21:45.000
And while I´m at it, take care
of some business, Texas style.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.500
At 0900 hours, Greenwich Mean Time...

21:52.800 --> 21:56.000
...the inaugural flight of Majestic
Air will fly over the summit...

21:56.300 --> 21:58.300
...and we´ll be there to wave them on!

22:02.700 --> 22:05.900
To the other teams climbing,
I´d like to say be safe...

22:06.600 --> 22:08.200
...and good luck.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.100
Kick up your heels
and enjoy the barbecue!

22:22.900 --> 22:25.200
What about the weather, Mr. Vaughn?

22:30.800 --> 22:33.400
We hope for the best.
You know something we don´t?

22:35.200 --> 22:37.600
The weather closes in
and people die up there.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.700
Or don´t you have to worry about that?

22:43.700 --> 22:47.000
Anybody who doesn´t worry
about that is a fool.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.700
Brian Maki did a high-atmosphere
analysis of the last 4 decades.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.700
Most years there´s a 9-to-1 2-day Iull
before the fall storms.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.800
On August 2nd, we calculate
an 82 % chance of fine weather.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.000
Give me odds like that
in the oil business, I´d be rich.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.000
Who´s the leader, Mr. Vaughn?

23:10.900 --> 23:14.800
Who makes decisions that mean
other people live or die?

23:15.100 --> 23:16.700
Who plays God, so to speak?

23:17.800 --> 23:22.200
There can be only one leader.
It´s always the best climber.

23:23.300 --> 23:27.000
I´ve made it clear to everyone
that Tom McLaren is that man.

23:31.100 --> 23:34.100
Even the Pakistanis agree.
They´re giving you a 21 -gun salute.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.200
Okay, let´s party!

23:44.400 --> 23:45.800
Thanks for that, Elliot.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.400
You climb as good as you talk,
we´ll get you there.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.900
You know that old guy
who was asking questions?

25:10.500 --> 25:12.000
Montgomery Wick.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.700
Remember Dad used to talk about him?

25:19.900 --> 25:21.600
They were in the service together--

25:21.800 --> 25:23.500
Of course, I remember.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.200
I miss him, Annie.
I miss him just as much as--

25:32.600 --> 25:34.000
I can´t talk about it.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.900
You never have.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.400
There´s nothing to say.
He´s gone, Peter.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.700
Look, you can blame me all you want...

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
...but that last cam would´ve failed.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.300
It held the two of us.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.800
You want to do this?
Okay, fine, let´s do it.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.000
You didn´t give it a chance.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.900
-He knew it wouldn´t hold either.
-Of course he didn´t.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.500
We were his life.

26:00.700 --> 26:04.500
He would´ve died rather than take
a chance anything might happen to us.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.800
I think we owed him the same.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.200
But I did what I thought was right.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.900
If you´re so right, why haven´t
you climbed? Or been to his grave?

26:18.000 --> 26:22.200
I´m not going up there for a TV show.
I´m going up there for him.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.100
I want to be the person
he always wanted me to be.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.200
When I´m up there, I feel close
to him.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.800
I touch his soul.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.900
Take care up there.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.700
This is it.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.100
Wish you were going with me.

26:54.300 --> 26:59.000
Not this time. Take care up there.
It´ll be a great day for Texas.

26:59.300 --> 27:00.900
And Scotland.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.800
What is it?

28:19.300 --> 28:20.800
Spindrift coming off the top.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.600
That´s local. If something was coming
in, it´d show on the other peaks.

28:25.100 --> 28:28.400
Your sister´s fine, man.
You look after yourself.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.400
You too. Thanks for everything.

29:45.400 --> 29:49.200
Understood, Tom.
You guys take good care up there.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.300
Thanks, base. Out.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.400
Well, you heard it.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.200
Computer model shows it´s building.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
That´s a concern.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.400
We´re about an hour from
the bottleneck, right?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.800
Let´s kick it and get up there.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Gets any worse,
we´ll shelter under the ice cliffs.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.800
If it comes in fast,
we´re totally exposed out here.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.100
It´s not fast.
He said it´s slow-moving.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.400
There´s a 70 % chance
it´ll turn east and miss us.

30:23.700 --> 30:26.500
I´m not gonna risk a storm.
Not at 26,000.

30:26.700 --> 30:30.000
We´re not suggesting anything stupid.
The weather could turn.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.400
The odds are with us.
We´re five hours from the summit.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.800
We turn back now, that´s it.
We´ve lost our window.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.900
I know. Elliot, I´m aware of that.
It´s my responsibility.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.800
I won´t let a marketing campaign
compromise our safety.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.500
You think this is
about a marketing campaign?

30:48.600 --> 30:51.500
Come on, Tom.
This is about getting to the top.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.700
I don´t give a shit
about the publicity.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.200
This is a life statement for me.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.200
We´re only 500 feet from
the bottleneck. Let´s keep going.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.100
Okay.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.400
Okay.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.400
Let´s go.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.000
980 hecto-Pascals and falling.

31:42.300 --> 31:46.100
Lenticular cloud to the southeast.
Winds at 80 knots, rising.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.000
Tom says he´s going on.
What´s base camp pressure?

31:49.300 --> 31:51.500
Pressure´s dropped two points
in four hours.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.800
You made your case. We listened.
We decided.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.800
It´s too high a risk. Why am I here
if you don´t listen to me?

31:58.200 --> 32:02.800
I´ll assess the risk. As to why
you´re here, I wonder myself.

32:03.100 --> 32:06.300
I´m Annie´s brother.
McLaren´s pulling them back, right?

32:06.700 --> 32:08.600
We´re on target. They´re going on.

32:08.900 --> 32:12.100
The wind´s hit to the south.
What´s your satellite show?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.300
We´ve assessed the data.
We´re going up.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.800
It shows bad air coming in from India.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.800
What the hell are you doing?

32:24.600 --> 32:27.300
-How high are they?
-26,000.

32:28.700 --> 32:31.300
-What are you doing?!
-Warning my sister!

32:31.500 --> 32:33.700
Leave it! That´s enough!

32:35.800 --> 32:37.600
Tom McLaren, come in.

32:38.700 --> 32:41.100
Tom McLaren, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

32:41.400 --> 32:43.300
Tom McLaren, do you read?

32:46.700 --> 32:47.900
Come in, base.

32:48.200 --> 32:52.400
You´ve got a major storm coming in.
You´ve gotta start down.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.200
Who is this?

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
Peter Garrett.
You copy about the storm?

32:57.700 --> 33:00.700
Where´s Frank Williams?
Put Frank Williams on.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.800
Skip here. We´re looking
at the weather screens.

33:07.100 --> 33:11.300
If this doesn´t turn, you´ll be in
big trouble. Turn back immediately.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
Do you copy?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.900
Yeah, I copy that.
Thanks, Skip. Out.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.400
How we doing?

33:18.600 --> 33:21.200
I´m pulling the plug.
We´re going down.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.800
-Just hold on.
-I´m sorry, Elliot.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.700
You pay me to make these decisions.

33:26.900 --> 33:28.500
I´m paying you to get me to the top.

33:28.700 --> 33:32.900
Jesus! Elliot, you told me
I was in charge up here.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.500
You are! Why are you vacillating?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.500
Because some second-rate guide
got on the radio?

33:38.700 --> 33:40.600
Nobody knows this mountain better
than Skip.

33:40.800 --> 33:44.800
Skip Taylor´s a hustler. He was
jockeying me to be in your boots.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.700
Don´t crap out on me now.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.700
Come on, what did you think?

33:50.200 --> 33:54.000
She´d just lift up her skirt
and pull her panties down for us?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.000
Is this how you got up Everest twice?

33:57.900 --> 33:59.300
I´m going down.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.400
Fine. Fine.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.199
Go down. Go on. Sit it out.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.100
The storm will turn and you´ll spend
the rest of your life living it down.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.300
That should do wonders
for your business.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.800
I´m sorry, can I? Please.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.800
We´re going back!

35:19.800 --> 35:24.000
We don´t have a choice!
We are dead on the ridge! Let´s go!

35:30.400 --> 35:31.600
Fuck you!

36:43.700 --> 36:44.600
Annie!

36:45.800 --> 36:47.300
Annie, can you hear me?

36:47.600 --> 36:51.000
I´m all right! I´m safe!

36:56.000 --> 36:57.300
Elliot!

36:57.600 --> 37:00.400
I´m fine! We´re okay!

37:15.900 --> 37:17.600
Avalanche!

38:26.900 --> 38:28.900
Annie, are you there?
Can you hear me?

39:12.300 --> 39:15.200
Come in, base, this is summit team.
Do you read me?

39:22.600 --> 39:26.900
Anybody, do you read me? This is
the Vaughn summit team. Come in.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.500
Summit team, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

39:35.400 --> 39:37.600
Summit team, this is base camp.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.200
If you´re gonna do that,
do it outside.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
Base, this is summit team.
Are you trying to contact us?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.800
Here. Let me.

40:53.100 --> 40:55.600
Oh, my God. That´s Morse code.

40:56.700 --> 41:00.800
My dad taught us when we were kids.
Said it could save your life.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
Smart man, your father.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.200
He sure was.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.400
There´s three of them.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.200
Vaughn.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.700
Tom.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.400
Annie.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.100
I´m sorry, Kareem.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.100
You say there are three.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.800
Maybe there are others.

41:59.700 --> 42:00.900
Maybe.

42:08.300 --> 42:12.300
Tell them we can´t keep talking.
We gotta save power.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.400
He´s right.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.400
What´s he saying, Annie?

42:20.500 --> 42:22.200
They´re coming to get us.

42:24.700 --> 42:28.100
It´s not just snow.
It´s gonna be ice and rock.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
We need special tools.
I don´t know how much we have here.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.200
Then how do you get it
up there, Mr. Garrett?

42:36.800 --> 42:39.100
Then we dig with our bare hands
if we have to.

42:39.400 --> 42:43.500
Whatever it takes. We have more than
enough guys here to get this done.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.600
What the hell do you want to do?
Just leave them there?

42:57.000 --> 42:57.900
Peter.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.900
You can´t ask people to work there.

43:03.100 --> 43:05.000
That high, just staying alive is--

43:05.300 --> 43:07.900
So we just walk away
and forget about them?

43:08.800 --> 43:13.100
They had one fuel can each. They can
melt ice and rehydrate for a day.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.500
At 26,000, without it,
their lungs fill with fluid.

43:15.700 --> 43:18.800
That´s pulmonary edema,
they die within another 1 2.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.100
That gives us a window of 36 hours.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.000
Montgomery Wick.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.800
Wick speed-summited in 24.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.600
We´re not Montgomery Wick.

43:35.900 --> 43:39.000
Even if we were, how long does that
leave to get through the rock and ice?

43:42.400 --> 43:46.100
We don´t know their exact location.
How long will that take?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.700
I won´t let Annie die.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.200
So what are we gonna do?

44:38.200 --> 44:40.500
Nitroglycerin, Mr. Garrett.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.200
I wouldn´t touch it
with an English barge pole.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.400
We use it to blast rock
for gun emplacements.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.400
It´s low-freezing
and more powerful than symtex.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.100
My responsibility ends at that door.

44:53.400 --> 44:56.700
I want to make one thing clear.
This is your decision.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.200
It´s got nothing
to do with the Pakistani army.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.400
Which is a legal way of saying
I think it´s madness.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.800
A magnificent madness, though.

45:05.100 --> 45:06.200
Good luck.

45:09.100 --> 45:10.200
Stop!

45:11.400 --> 45:14.100
Skip, don´t move your feet.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.800
Everybody keep very still.

45:29.100 --> 45:30.400
Okay, Skip.

46:31.700 --> 46:34.800
Let me get this straight.
You want to go up that hill...

46:35.000 --> 46:38.200
...with nitro on your back
and hope that it doesn´t jolt?

46:38.700 --> 46:39.500
That´s right.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.400
A hundred thousand sperm
and you were the fastest?

46:48.300 --> 46:51.000
Skip here´s agreed to go,
so I need four more.

46:51.400 --> 46:54.600
It´ll be a speed ascent,
in pairs, one canister per team.

46:55.300 --> 46:58.900
People have to share?
Won´t everyone want their own bomb?

47:04.500 --> 47:05.400
Ed.

47:05.900 --> 47:07.700
You´re the best climber here.

47:09.100 --> 47:12.300
I´m not one to walk away,
but I think it´s suicide.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.100
If we just leave them,
what do you call that?

47:14.400 --> 47:17.600
It´s reality. You´re willing
to risk six lives to save three?

47:18.100 --> 47:19.300
How do you feel about that?

47:19.600 --> 47:20.800
The same way you do.

47:21.100 --> 47:25.600
Your best friend died on Everest.
What if it was him up there right now?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.200
I will go.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.800
Ali is my cousin. It is my duty.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.200
How about it, Mal? You and Cyril
have been up there before.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.000
No....

47:50.400 --> 47:52.000
Why would we want to leave this place?

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
Luxurious accommodation.
Fine cuisine.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.500
Sultry weather.
Frostbite´s off my dick.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.600
I reckon we should wait
until they chuck in a ski lift.

47:59.800 --> 48:03.300
Good idea. Imagine coming to the
Himalayas and actually climbing.

48:03.500 --> 48:06.600
Especially when you have
to complete your autobiography.

48:06.800 --> 48:11.400
And rustle up those all-important
endorsements. You wankers!

48:15.300 --> 48:17.600
What´s bloody wrong with you?!

48:18.200 --> 48:19.600
We´re in.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.500
Thank you.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.800
I need one more.

48:35.600 --> 48:38.400
I´ll write a check now
for anyone who goes.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.400
Whether Elliot makes it or not,
I´ll be waiting when you get back.

48:42.700 --> 48:44.800
Half a million bucks.

48:51.500 --> 48:52.800
Does that include the tip?

49:15.400 --> 49:19.800
My brother´s got explosives.
They´re gonna blast their way down.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.900
Blast their way down.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.900
How are they gonna find us?
We might as well be on Mars.

49:28.200 --> 49:31.000
It´s not a question of how,
it´s how long.

49:31.700 --> 49:35.200
It´s time that´s gonna kill us.
We have to lay down a schedule.

49:35.700 --> 49:37.400
A regimen we all adhere to.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.200
Edema sets in
if we don´t keep drinking.

49:40.500 --> 49:44.000
Now, I figure, three water bottles...

49:44.200 --> 49:45.800
...that´s half a cup each,
every 2 hours.

49:46.100 --> 49:50.100
After that, fuel cells to melt ice,
and finally...

49:50.400 --> 49:52.000
...we use the dex syringes.

49:53.100 --> 49:55.700
Chances are we´re all gonna get
pretty sick...

49:56.200 --> 49:59.200
...but if we keep to the schedule,
keep to it...

49:59.700 --> 50:00.900
...maybe we can hold out.

50:02.800 --> 50:07.300
Annie, we need to give them the grid
reference for our last known position.

50:07.700 --> 50:11.700
She says they were about 300 feet
above the Anvil, heading down east.

50:12.100 --> 50:13.600
The shoulder ice field.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.200
I checked their manifest.
This is what they have.

50:16.500 --> 50:20.500
We leave at dawn.
They got 22 hours if they´re lucky.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.100
How high can we chopper in?

50:22.400 --> 50:25.100
Rasul says 21 ,000.
Any higher, the air´s too thin.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.300
He drops us.
How fast can we get there?

50:27.600 --> 50:31.800
Negrotto Col´s the only place we can
land. From there, 27 hours.

50:41.600 --> 50:43.200
Five hours short.

50:46.800 --> 50:50.200
We need Montgomery Wick. He´s the
only man who´s done it faster.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.400
Will he do it?

50:53.900 --> 50:58.200
Four years ago, a big storm blows
an American team off the hill.

50:58.600 --> 51:02.200
There´s nine up there, including
his wife. She was a guide.

51:02.600 --> 51:06.900
He knows he can´t help her, but he
goes anyway. The only one who did.

51:07.200 --> 51:11.400
He lost all his toes to frostbite
but dragged 3 guys off the mountain.

51:11.700 --> 51:14.900
They owe their lives to him.
What do you reckon?

51:16.500 --> 51:17.400
Where is he?

51:18.000 --> 51:21.600
On the mountain.
Up the shoulder, where he always goes.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.200
They never found his wife´s body,
so he keeps looking.

51:25.600 --> 51:27.000
The guy´s a lunatic.

51:28.300 --> 51:29.600
That´s just what we need.

51:30.700 --> 51:32.900
Yeah. Strap on the nitro.

51:56.300 --> 51:58.800
That´s a great idea.
Smoking next to the nitro.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
Although, bro and I always hoped
that you´d blow us.

52:27.700 --> 52:28.900
Why are you going?

52:29.300 --> 52:30.900
The money, of course.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.600
Skip hasn´t paid anyone in months.
You know of a better way out?

52:36.300 --> 52:37.600
Can you climb?

52:40.500 --> 52:42.600
Peter wants to know if I can climb.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.200
Worst I´ve seen.
Couldn´t climb a ladder.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.600
You´re that good, huh?

52:50.100 --> 52:53.900
Yeah. But it was a very tall ladder.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.700
What the hell are you doing?

53:12.300 --> 53:14.700
I´m trying to kiss my ass goodbye.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.800
It´s dawn.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.500
If the weather´s cleared,
they´ll be on their way.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.100
I know.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.600
Thank you.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.800
And your brother?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.800
Has he climbed since Utah?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.100
No.

53:46.100 --> 53:49.800
People say he lost his nerve.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.300
Have you heard that?

53:52.700 --> 53:55.600
Yeah, I´ve heard that.

54:18.000 --> 54:18.800
Annie!

54:19.000 --> 54:21.100
It´s a pack! Quick!

54:57.000 --> 54:58.600
I´m not interested.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.400
You went before.
Men owe you their lives.

55:04.600 --> 55:07.100
Four years ago.
Now I just climb for myself.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.400
My father was a climber. Royce
Garrett. He climbed Everest with you.

55:12.700 --> 55:16.100
I don´t care. I don´t live my life
so you can look up to me.

55:16.300 --> 55:17.800
My sister´s dying up there.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.400
Before you lecture me,
get your facts straight.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.400
It´ll be less embarrassing.

55:22.600 --> 55:26.000
Up there, you´re not dying,
Mr. Garrett. You´re dead.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.600
What the hell happened to you?

55:34.000 --> 55:37.200
Vaughn´s people are offering $500,000
to anyone that goes.

55:37.400 --> 55:39.300
Maybe that´ll make a difference.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.800
Why would they do that?

55:42.000 --> 55:43.400
He´s one of them.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.200
What´s their supply situation?

55:53.400 --> 55:54.600
Enough for 22 hours.

55:54.800 --> 55:56.200
Twenty-two.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.200
Who´s coordinating at base?

55:58.400 --> 56:00.600
-Vaughn´s people.
-That´s a mistake.

56:00.800 --> 56:05.300
I´ll need someone there I can trust.
Taylor, you know the mountain best.

56:05.500 --> 56:08.400
Skip´s one of the best climbers.
We´ll need him.

56:08.600 --> 56:11.800
Let´s agree on one thing:
This is not a climbing democracy.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.700
On a rescue, we don´t vote,
question or argue.

56:14.900 --> 56:18.200
You listen and do exactly as I say.
Chopper will take you back.

56:26.600 --> 56:30.800
Here´s how we´ll split it up.
Malcolm, you´ll climb with Kareem.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.400
-Cyril, you´ll--
-What? No, I bloody won´t.

56:34.600 --> 56:37.700
You´ve been up the mountain too long
and forgotten the rules.

56:37.900 --> 56:39.800
Never eat at a place called "Ma´s" ...

56:40.000 --> 56:42.600
...don´t play cards
with a fellow named Doc...

56:42.800 --> 56:46.500
...and never climb with a stranger.
I´m going with my brother.

56:47.300 --> 56:49.800
Frankly, I´d rather climb
with the Sheila.

56:50.700 --> 56:53.700
My rules: I put a strong climber
with a weaker one.

56:53.900 --> 56:55.800
You´ll climb with Kareem.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.700
Mr. Garrett,
you´ll be climbing with me.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.300
Cyril. Guess what?

57:03.900 --> 57:06.000
Come on, darling.
Give us a smile, eh!

57:06.200 --> 57:09.400
It´s the second best thing
you can do with your lips.

57:15.900 --> 57:18.500
We´ll take the west ridge.
Cyril, the Mushroom.

57:18.700 --> 57:20.400
Malcolm, Hockey Stick Gully.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.400
Speed up all of them is the same.

57:58.200 --> 58:00.200
We´re as high as I can take you!

58:21.000 --> 58:23.200
Move it! I can´t hold it for long!

58:53.500 --> 58:54.400
Next!

59:18.700 --> 59:21.400
I´m having trouble
maintaining altitude.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.800
Get out of here! We´re gonna burn!

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.400
Go! Move it! Move it!

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.600
Grab my hand, damn it! Grab it!

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.200
Come on! Come on!

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.300
He needs dex. Now.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.600
No.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.800
We stick to the schedule.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.600
In nine hours, the water runs out.
We need it. Our lives depend on it.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.200
He´ll die if he doesn´t get it.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.300
He will anyway.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.700
Come on, Annie.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.500
We both know Tom isn´t going anywhere.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.200
You´ve done your best. You have.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.100
We can´t waste resources
on a lost cause.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.600
Saving somebody´s life
is not a lost cause.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.200
It is, if you know
they can´t be saved.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.800
Why should three people die
if two can live?

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.200
Okay. If that´s what you think,
why don´t you go tell him yourself?

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.500
Tom, can you hear me?

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.000
-Don´t listen to--
-He has a right to know!

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.700
You´re a climber, Tom. A pro.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.400
You know the reality.
Even if they get to us...

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.600
...they can´t carry you down.
Not from this altitude.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.800
Now, Annie wants to give you the dex.
I understand that, I do.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But you and I know it´s just
delaying what´s inevitable.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.400
Just lie here and die, Elliot?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.600
Is that what you´re telling me?

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.900
I´m not telling you anything.
I´m asking you to respect life...

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.200
...not to waste it.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.300
-If I was in your position--
-You´re not in my position!

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.000
That´s right, I´m not.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.200
Understand something. You´re not just
killing me. You´re killing her too.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.800
We´re on a bit of a deadline, mate.
Can we just leave this till later?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.300
He´s all right, isn´t he,
this Allah bloke?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.700
He won´t strike you dead
if you miss one prayer, will he?

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.400
All right. One prayer.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.100
Under the circumstances.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.500
What harm can it do?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.400
Do Muslims believe in Hell?

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.100
Do you?

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.300
So if that thing there blows...

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.800
...and I don´t believe in Allah,
I´m going to Hell?

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.700
Is that what you reckon?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.800
You´re all the bloody same,
aren´t you?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.400
Born-agains say I don´t believe
in Jesus, so I´ll go to hell.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.200
Jews say I do believe in Jesus,
I´ll go to Hell.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.200
Catholics say I don´t believe
in the pope, I´ll go to Hell.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.000
So any way you look at it,
I´m in the shit.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.600
Well, go on, then. What did he say?

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.200
We gonna die up here or what?

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.800
All men die, my friend.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.600
But Allah says it is what we do
before we die that counts.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.400
Jet stream´s rising. I´d say
all clear for the next 48 hours.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200
Wick, do you copy?

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.500
Copy.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.900
Pressure´s up. You have clear skies
and light winds. Over.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.500
How long will it last?

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.600
You´re good for the next 48 hours.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.900
What is your exact position? over.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.600
The rock wall, about 400 feet
above Negrotto Col.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.700
I thought you´d be at the top by now.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:35.300
Yeah, so did I. What´s the status
at 26,000? How´s the girl?

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.500
As far as I can tell, okay.
McLaren´s serious. Internal injuries.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.000
And Vaughn?

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.600
No word.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.200
Keep me informed.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.900
What is this with you and Vaughn?

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.600
You´re too slow, Mr. Garrett.
You´ve gotta move faster.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.800
Take your hands off me.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.100
It´s not your concern.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.800
If it involves my sister,
it´s my concern.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.200
I made it clear.
No arguments, no questions.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.900
Look, if you´ve got another agenda...

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.100
...why don´t you go back?
I don´t need you.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.200
Your sister will be dead in 1 4 hours.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.600
Good luck.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.100
I´ve got you. I´ve got you.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.800
You´re as crazy as your old man.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.500
You did the right thing
to cut the rope.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.200
Any good climber would have.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.100
If Royce had had the knife,
he´d have done it himself.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.700
I just got some spindrift in my lungs.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.600
Summit team, this is alpha team.
Do you read?

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.300
This is summit team. Come in, alpha.
This is summit team.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.399
Annie Garrett, is that you?

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.600
It´s Elliot Vaughn. Who´s this?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.500
Montgomery Wick.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.200
-How many are you?
-Three teams, different routes.

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:19.700
I´m with Peter Garrett.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.800
I thought you only climbed solo.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.899
Rescue missions are different.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.800
What´s your location?

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:31.100
West ridge, 23, 000.

01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:33.899
You´ll have to climb faster.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.300
Tell Garrett Annie has edema.
That´ll speed him up.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.500
Wick! Wick, this is Annie Garrett!

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:44.000
Wick! Do you read, Wick?

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.300
She needs dex.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
It´s too soon. She´ll have to wait.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.100
Annie.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.700
Get it.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.300
I told you.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.900
I told you not to let her
give it to you.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.800
You saddled up that pony,
now she can ride it.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.700
Vaughn, you´re not sick!

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.100
Not yet.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.100
We hold to the schedule.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.200
-It´s the only way to stay alive.
-For you, maybe.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:38.500
You know, Tom, intelligence doesn´t
threaten me. Stupidity does.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.700
You arrogant prick!

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.600
We wouldn´t be here
if it wasn´t for you.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.100
You were the leader, Tom.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.400
He´s right.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.900
None of us are gonna make it.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.200
You want to survive?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.300
Go and get it.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.000
That´s what I thought.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.500
Use your ax!

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.200
Cyril!

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.600
-Cyril!
-I´m here!

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.600
I´m coming!

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.000
It´s coming through!

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.000
Hang on! It´s gonna be okay!

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.000
Just hang on.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.500
That´s all there is.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.600
You see the rocks to your left?

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.200
Yeah, I can see them!

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.900
I´m gonna swing you.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Look out!

01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:00.200
Cyril! Cyril, are you there?
Peter, are you there?

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.200
Malcolm! This is Peter!

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.100
I repeat, this is Peter.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:09.100
-It wasn´t us!
-Cyril, you answer me, you bastard!

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.300
Cyril!

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.600
Are you there?

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.500
Cyril!

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.400
Damn it, you answer me!

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.700
Nag, nag, nag.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.200
They always bloody nag.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.100
You´re sick.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.200
They could still be alive.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.000
I´m going back.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.000
Mr. Garrett.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.100
Your sister has pulmonary edema.
We don´t have the time.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.800
Monique and Cyril are question marks.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600
Your sister is not.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.900
Bro, I´m sorry.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.200
We gotta go.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.200
You gotta straighten it.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.200
Go ahead.

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.500
It´ll be fine. Just look me--

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:54.100
Don´t bullshit me, Peter.
I´m a nurse.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.800
Where were you going?

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.600
-What are you talking about?
-Where will you go with the money?

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.000
Anywhere!

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600
Tell me.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.800
Paris.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.600
I did two years of premed.
I want to finish it.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.200
Any career worth this?

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:37.700
Two years on Everest, three at K2.
I´ve had enough.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.500
Skip makes the Pakistanis look
well-organized, plus he´s sexist.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.900
-How long you been sleeping with him?
-Two years, and screw--

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.000
My friend...

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.600
...I think you should turn back.

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.800
Wick, do you copy?

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.700
Wick, this is base camp. Do you copy?

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:41.800
Come in, base.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.000
The nitro reacts to the sun.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.700
Get the nitro out of the sun.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.400
Get that goddamn pack out of the sun!

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.900
It´s gonna blow!

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.600
It´s gonna blow!

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.400
Get the pack in the shade!

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.700
The nitro! It´s gonna blow!
Get it out of the sun!

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.700
In the shade! There it is!

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.800
Malcolm! Can you hear me?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.900
It´s not their call time!

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.300
Malcolm, do you read?!

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.400
You take the shoulder.
I´ll try the ridge.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.500
Malcolm!

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.800
Malcolm!

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.200
Kareem!

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.800
Malcolm! Kareem! Can you hear me?!

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.300
You guys! Your radio!

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.500
Turn on your radio!

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.500
Come in, Peter.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800
Are you listening?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.200
Malcolm, get the nitro into the shade!

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.100
Please, Peter, repeat.
I don´t understand.

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:40.400
Get the nitro into the shade right now
or it will blow! Do you understand?

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.700
Don´t touch her.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.400
Is this what you´re looking for?

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.600
Four years ago, an American team
got blown off the mountain.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:17.400
She was the guide.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.800
What happened?
She take shelter with Vaughn?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.800
Twenty-four, thirty-six hours.
I figure she died of edema.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.600
If only she´d had dex.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.100
-You´re wasting time.
-You think he used it for himself?

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.100
-Answer me, damn it!
-Of course he did!

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.300
How long have you known?

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.500
At the interview,
he said the dex got swept away.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.000
That was a lie.
She always carried it on her.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.600
Four years, Wick?

01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:51.200
The mountain owns him.
He had to come back.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.000
Now you´re gonna kill him.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.000
My wife died of edema.

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.000
Skin stripped from her throat,
lungs filled with water.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.600
She drowned in her own bodily fluids.
Yeah, I´m gonna kill him.

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.300
I can´t let you do it.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.300
Do you know where you are?

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.800
Above 24,000, you´re at the
vertical limit, you´re already dying.

01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.000
Look at you. You can hardly stand.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.600
If you think you can stop me,
go ahead.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.400
Peter. Are you there?

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.200
Peter.

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.100
Annie. Annie, is it you?

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.700
Annie. Annie, what is it?

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.700
Where are you?

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.900
Five hours away.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.000
I want you to go back.

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.900
Don´t risk it. There´s no reason.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I won´t be here and neither will Tom.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.800
How long?

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.600
An hour. Two at the most.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.300
Peter. Peter!

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.900
I´m here, Annie.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.500
I´ve been thinking.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.600
I´ve been thinking a lot about Dad.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.200
We shouldn´t have gotten him a grave.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.400
We should have come up here
together with his ashes.

01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.100
He said this is where he was happiest.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.200
He was a climber.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.200
I think every real climber
would want to stay on the mountain.

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.100
What do you think?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.100
I think we´ll come back some day.

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.300
The two of us.

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.700
For Dad.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.300
I would´ve liked that.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.600
-I´m coming to get you, Annie.
-No, don´t.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.300
Promise me. I don´t want you to die.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.400
-I don´t care!
-Don´t put me through it, understand?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.200
Please.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.400
Just...

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.300
...please don´t.

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.600
Please.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.700
Good night, Peter.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.400
I love you.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.400
Are you gonna kill me now?

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.700
Yes.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.600
Bastard!

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.500
Are you ready?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.800
I can´t get them to melt.
They´re frozen.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.100
-Boil the water!
-With what?

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:57.400
Easy.

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.200
Easy.

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:05.000
Wait.

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.000
Okay. Keep feeding it.

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.000
Keep it coming.

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.800
Stop! It´s leaking!

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.800
We can try and push it through
before it rips.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.300
On three.

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.800
One, two, three!

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.800
Annie!

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.100
Annie!

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.400
Hold it! Hold it!

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:21.300
No! No!

01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.600
How is she?

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.800
Amazing.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.400
Talk about a will to live.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.900
-That´s not a song.
-That´s definitely a song.

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.600
No way that´s a song.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.600
That´s a good song.

01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:14.000
A winning song, by the sound of it.

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:16.200
I think you´re making it up.

01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.800
That was a hell of a thing
you did up there.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.400
Anybody else would´ve given up.

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.900
Not everybody.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.700
He´d be proud of you.

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.500
Angry, but really proud.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.300
Get some sleep.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:59:19.400
