00:03.046 --> 00:04.656
Oh, and my fiancé--

00:04.700 --> 00:08.660
[chuckles]
I love saying that--

00:08.704 --> 00:11.228
we'’ve been talking about
the guest list for our wedding.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.491
While we'’d love
to invite everyone,

00:13.535 --> 00:15.580
we'’re gonna have to make
some hard choices.

00:15.624 --> 00:18.583
Hint: a good pre-wedding gift
could be the bump you need.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.629
Any Apple products

00:20.672 --> 00:23.414
gets you in the first five rows.

00:23.458 --> 00:26.417
Does she really think this
is gonna be a hot ticket?

00:26.461 --> 00:29.072
Welcome to the waiting list,
Marjorie.

00:29.116 --> 00:32.206
Would a waffle iron
get me a good seat?

00:32.249 --> 00:33.381
It'’ll get you in the building.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.863
I'’ll share.
Christy, alcoholic.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.256
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.563
You know, she is not
kidding about that list.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.521
I don'’t even think
Imade the cut.

00:43.565 --> 00:47.047
Anyway, my boyfriend is in town
this weekend for his birthday,

00:47.090 --> 00:50.441
and I saved enough money
to take him to dinner,

00:50.485 --> 00:52.052
buy him a travel mug,

00:52.095 --> 00:54.750
and... get professionally waxed.

00:56.621 --> 00:59.711
So no more bristly patches.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.713
It'’s true what they say:

01:01.757 --> 01:04.890
if you stay sober,
your life gets bigger and better

01:04.934 --> 01:08.764
and... smoother.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.549
Thanks.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.812
Of course you'’re
invited to the wedding.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.250
I'’m gonna need someone to
hold up my dress while I pee.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.384
All right, we have
time for one more.

01:20.428 --> 01:23.213
Uh, would our newcomer
like to share?

01:23.257 --> 01:25.998
Hi, I'’m Jill, alcoholic.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.652
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.176
It'’s weird to call myself
a newcomer,

01:29.219 --> 01:30.525
but that'’s what I am.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.093
Got the one-day chip
to prove it.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.617
'’Course I keep slipping, so
I got about ten of these things.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.098
By the way,
should I be recycling '’em?

01:38.141 --> 01:39.751
you know like give a penny,
take a penny?

01:41.405 --> 01:44.234
Anyhow...

01:44.278 --> 01:46.932
I'’ve been having a hard time
staying sober,

01:46.976 --> 01:49.892
but this morning felt different.
I got up off the lawn,

01:49.935 --> 01:51.589
before the sprinklers
went off this time.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.244
I went inside,

01:54.288 --> 01:55.593
poured myself a cup of coffee

01:55.637 --> 01:59.119
with just cream, no vodka,

01:59.162 --> 02:00.946
and said "Morning, world!

02:00.990 --> 02:03.601
It'’s a brand new day."

02:03.645 --> 02:06.604
Also, if I sent you
a video of myself

02:06.648 --> 02:08.954
singing Carrie Underwood naked,
could you please delete it?

02:08.998 --> 02:11.783
Thanks.

02:11.827 --> 02:15.135
I'’ll show it to you
when we get home.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.184
CHRISTY:
Get ready for your next
birthday surprise.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.143
Whoa.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.931
Look quick, '’cause
it'’s coming off fast.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.629
Wow, I did not think
you could top that travel mug.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.941
Smooth.
I know!

02:41.552 --> 02:44.729
[cell phone vibrating]

02:44.773 --> 02:46.818
Oh, please tell me that'’s
something in your bedside table

02:46.862 --> 02:48.646
that we'’re gonna use later.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.648
I'’ll turn it off.
Okay.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.828
Oh, God, it'’s my friend Jill.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.961
I hate to do this,
but I got to go.

02:59.004 --> 03:02.269
Now? Not, like, ten
glorious minutes from now?

03:02.312 --> 03:04.227
Sorry, it'’s an emergency.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.576
W-What'’s wrong?

03:05.620 --> 03:07.187
She'’s been trying to get sober,

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
and now she'’s drunk
and freaking out.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.452
I promise I'’ll
make it up to you.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.500
[door closes, reopens]

03:16.544 --> 03:17.849

there'’s chocolate sauce

03:17.893 --> 03:19.024
in the nightstand.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.682
Can you believe this?

03:24.726 --> 03:26.858
I know, we were
just getting started.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.251
Oh? We were done.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.905
Wow.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.428
Yeah.
We'’ve been together a while.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.517
We got it down
to three essential moves.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.432
♪

03:51.709 --> 03:53.450
I can'’t believe it.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.670
I went to the market
to get some almond milk,

03:55.713 --> 03:58.499
and I ended up buying
two fifths of vodka.

03:58.542 --> 04:02.285
Ugh.
You drink almond milk?

04:02.329 --> 04:06.115
More coffee and cookies.
May I go home now?

04:06.158 --> 04:09.727
Yeah. I'’m sorry
about your shoes.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.947
Thank you
for aiming down this time.

04:11.990 --> 04:15.516
Good night.
Thank you, Soledad.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.215
Why does this keep happening?

04:19.259 --> 04:22.174
Oh, honey, it'’s a cunning
and baffling disease.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.741
That'’s the best you got?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.308
Give me a break.
It'’s late.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.831
I'’m not wearing a bra.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.575
The important thing
is that you called us.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.577
And that Soledad took
the scissors away

04:33.621 --> 04:35.057
before you gave
yourself a mullet.

04:36.841 --> 04:40.410
I really do want to get sober.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.151
It'’s okay.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.109
You'’re gonna get this.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.634
Just call us beforeyou go
to the market next time.

04:46.677 --> 04:47.983
We love you.
Yeah.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.158
We'’re here for you.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.899
Oh, my God.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.684
This cookie is giving me
my second orgasm of the night.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.775
Oh, yeah, you'’re totally
gonna get this.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.954
So they just don'’t
come home all night,

05:02.998 --> 05:04.391
and that'’s normal?

05:04.434 --> 05:05.609
Oh, you can'’t get hung up

05:05.653 --> 05:08.046
on what'’s normal around here.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.962
Be happy they left us
milk and toilet paper.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.008
Looks like the highlight
of my birthday weekend

05:13.051 --> 05:16.054
will be more time
with my dickweed brother.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.274
You call it your birthday,

05:18.318 --> 05:22.060
I call it the 54th anniversary
of you stealing my mother.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.584
[chuckles]

05:23.627 --> 05:25.194
What?

05:25.237 --> 05:27.196
Seriously, dude?

05:27.239 --> 05:29.067
You still eat
Captain Crunch?

05:29.111 --> 05:32.984
First of all, dude,

05:33.028 --> 05:35.509
it'’s pronounced "Cap'n."

05:37.293 --> 05:39.643
And you disrespect his service
to the Crunch Navy

05:39.687 --> 05:41.689
if you say it any other way.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.393

Boys, we'’re back.
In here.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.525
Hey, how'’s Jill?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.396
Ah, she yelled,

05:53.440 --> 05:55.485
she tried to make out
with Wendy,

05:55.529 --> 05:58.096
she took a swing at Marjorie--
nothing we haven'’t seen before.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.796
Now she'’s sleeping it off,
which is what I want to do.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.407
Caring about other people
is exhausting.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.931
I am never doing it again.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.803
Good night.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.848
You seem pretty beat.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.415
Me? No. No.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.375
I have a whole day
planned for us.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.725
We'’re gonna
go for a hike and...

06:17.768 --> 06:20.075
[yawning]:
see that documentary on bees

06:20.118 --> 06:22.643
you keep talking about
and, uh...

06:22.686 --> 06:25.036
then we'’re gonna
have a-a fabulous dinner.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.735
So, happy birthday.

06:27.778 --> 06:28.910
Yay.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.608
[chuckles]

06:31.652 --> 06:33.436
Yeah. Why don'’t we
just skip the hike

06:33.480 --> 06:36.004
and you go
take a nap, huh?

06:36.047 --> 06:37.614
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.790
Okay, yes.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.662
But two hours, tops,

06:41.705 --> 06:43.925
and then it'’s big fun
for you, mister.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.840
[chuckles]

06:45.883 --> 06:49.104
[chuckles softly]

06:49.147 --> 06:50.975
Yeah, I'’m not gonna see her
the rest of the day, am I?

06:51.019 --> 06:52.977
No.
Yeah.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588
BONNIE:
Adam!

06:54.631 --> 06:56.459
Coming!

06:56.503 --> 06:59.593
Sex helps her fall asleep.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.509
She says I'’ve got pure Ambien
between my legs.

07:07.252 --> 07:10.125
You guys don'’t have to worry
anymore. I got this.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.431
I realized what
I'’ve been doing wrong.

07:11.474 --> 07:12.910
I didn'’t have a plan,
but now I do.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.477
I went to a meeting
this morning,

07:14.521 --> 07:15.565
then went to another meeting
with you gals,

07:15.609 --> 07:16.871
gonna have my eyebrows
re-threaded,

07:16.914 --> 07:18.612
then go to another
meeting tonight.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.265
And I'’m gonna bookend every day
by calling Christy

07:20.309 --> 07:22.442
in the morning and again
at night to let her know

07:22.485 --> 07:23.573
I stuck with my plan.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.271
How'’s that for a plan?

07:26.315 --> 07:28.273
Well, it was
fast and wordy.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.101
And a very good plan.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.973
Christy, I hope
I didn'’t ruin

07:32.016 --> 07:33.975
your boyfriend'’s
birthday weekend.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.020
Patrick'’s fine.
When I woke up from my nap,

07:36.064 --> 07:37.544
he had left
to go bowling with Adam.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.068
Yes, Adam bowls.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.373
Nobody'’s perfect.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.115
I love bowling.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.943
I think it'’s sexy.

07:45.987 --> 07:49.251
Yeah. That'’s why there's
so much bowling porn.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.645
There is.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.517
Well, since y'’all
helped me so much,

07:54.561 --> 07:56.171
I brought each of you
a little something

07:56.214 --> 07:57.781
from my gift closet.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.783
ALL: Oh!
Oh, sweetie,

07:59.827 --> 08:01.698
that'’s very nice of you.
WENDY:
Thank you.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.570
But we don'’t help
people for gifts.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.354
We do it for fun
and for free.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.491
You'’re right.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.452
What?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.541
The bracelet.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.500
I was wearing this
when I came in.

08:24.939 --> 08:28.029
Do you know what would make
this outfit perfect?

08:28.072 --> 08:30.335
That bracelet you goody-goodies
made me give back.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.122
Don'’t you think it's great
that the four of us

08:34.165 --> 08:36.167
are gonna go out and...

08:36.211 --> 08:37.560
Oh, come on!

08:37.604 --> 08:39.780
[groans]
You come on.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.346
No! You have to change.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.000
Why do I have to change?

08:43.044 --> 08:44.611
Because it'’s my
boyfriend'’s birthday,

08:44.654 --> 08:46.656
so I get to wear
the slutty red dress.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.789
Nope. Everything'’s taped up
and Spanx'’d down. I'm done.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.316
Fine.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.013
Unzip me.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.537
I will.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.278

09:06.067 --> 09:09.070
Are you as freaked out as I am
that Jill hasn'’t been able

09:09.113 --> 09:11.507
to string more than a day or two
of sobriety together?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.857
Yeah.
It'’s scary.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.468
I can'’t imagine what it would be
like to start from zero again.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.993
Been there.
It sucks.

09:19.036 --> 09:22.562
I'’m afraid that if I went out,
I would never come back.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.476
Yeah, you would.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.305
'’Cause I'd drag you back
by the roots of your hair.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.221
Thanks, Mom.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.310
Okay. How do I look?

09:32.354 --> 09:34.008
Not better than me, so, good.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.579
Ah.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.711
So who won at bowling?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.060
Everyone who saw Patrick
fall on his ass

09:43.104 --> 09:44.671
trying to pick up a spare.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.108
Oh, hey, I would have
played better, but...

09:47.151 --> 09:48.849
I didn'’t bring my ball.
I didn'’t bring my ball.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.938
Wait a minute-- you have
your own bowling ball?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.243
That'’s the kind of thing
you should have disclosed

09:52.287 --> 09:53.593
on our first date.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.465
It'’s purple and it's sparkly.

09:56.508 --> 10:00.338
Hey, that'’s the color
of my bowling team.
[phone rings]

10:00.382 --> 10:02.906
Oh. It'’s... it's Jill,
but don'’t worry,

10:02.950 --> 10:06.083
it'’s just a bookend call.
I'’ll be-I'll be right back.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.303
Uh, a bookend?
That'’s when an alcoholic

10:08.346 --> 10:10.087
calls someone in the program
in the morning

10:10.131 --> 10:12.481
and then again at night
to let them know they'’re okay.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.135
Ah, look at you
learning the lingo.

10:14.178 --> 10:18.008
Hey. Watch enough Star Trek,
you learn a little Klingon.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.357

10:20.489 --> 10:22.099
Bad news.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.711
Wha... I-I thought
it was a-a bookend.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.756
No.
It was Jill'’s housekeeper.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.366
Jill showed up
at her place, drunk.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.325
I-I'’ve got...
I got to go get her.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.848
That'’s crazy--
it'’s Patrick's birthday.

10:31.892 --> 10:32.936
You stay, I'’ll go.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.285
Thanks, Bonnie.
I appreciate it.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.942
You'’re right.
My mom can handle it.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.640
Words I'’ve never said before.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.514
I'’m just gonna...
eat this in the car.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.517
I'’ll text you later.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.779
Please.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.174
Thank you for staying.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.176
Of course.
[chuckles]

10:55.219 --> 10:57.178
Jill'’s gonna be all right.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.875
[softly]:
Yeah.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.747
She definitely is.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.927
Uh, you know
what, Christy?

11:06.970 --> 11:09.190
Just go.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.844
Thank you.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.194
I'’m sorry, I-I'm just
so worried about her.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.546
Thank you.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.333
Well... I guess
this night'’s a bust.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.335
Should we just
get the check and go?

11:24.379 --> 11:26.598
Hell, no. Now we can order
whiskey and not have to sip it.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.556
Waiter!

11:33.867 --> 11:36.739
[knocking]
Thank you so
much for coming.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.436
I didn'’t know
who else to call.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.829
It'’s okay.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.091
[slurring]:
Oh, my Lord,

11:41.135 --> 11:44.660
her fingernails
are solong.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.444
Hey, Jill.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.664
Oh, my God!
Christy! Bonnie!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.753
I didn'’t know you guys
were friends with Soledad!

11:52.189 --> 11:54.409
Honey, what are you doing here?

11:54.452 --> 11:57.194
Oh, just watching TV,
but I'’m a little confused,

11:57.238 --> 11:59.457
'’cause it's all in...
[whispers]: Mexican.

12:01.503 --> 12:04.245
So, that lady with
the long nails right there--

12:04.288 --> 12:07.857
her husband is sleeping with
the girl with the pointy boobs,

12:07.901 --> 12:10.599
but pointy is having a baby

12:10.642 --> 12:12.035
with the guy in the eye patch.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.995
Did I get that right?
Más o menos.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.345
I love hanging out here.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.521
She'’s never been to
my house in her life.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.305
I don'’t even know
how she found me.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.046
'’Course I know where you live.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.919
I sent you those pears
for Christmas.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.877
Oh, yes, so much
better than cash.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.836
[speaking Spanish]

12:39.933 --> 12:41.586
Aren'’t they cute?

12:41.630 --> 12:43.588
Adorable.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.461
We need to get you home.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.158
But I don'’t want to go.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.117
Jill, you have to get up.
You can'’t stay here.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.902
Why not?
This used to be my couch.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.252
Oh. For all you know,

12:55.296 --> 12:58.125
they had a romantic evening
planned for tonight.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.257
It might even be his birthday,
and you'’re ruining it.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.955
Subtle.
I don'’t care.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.043
Well, you didn'’t
have to come.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.479
I want to be here for Jill.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.915
Then don'’t complain about it.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.221
I'’m not!
You kinda were!

13:07.264 --> 13:09.266
Bye, Soledad!

13:09.310 --> 13:11.878
See you later!

13:11.921 --> 13:15.446
♪ Happy birthday to you.

13:15.490 --> 13:18.928
Make a wish, sweetie.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.626
Remember when we couldn'’t do
this because people would stare?

13:21.670 --> 13:22.845
Ugh, the dark ages.

13:22.889 --> 13:23.846
Hold on.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.500
Oh, I will.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.111
Will you stop?
Don'’t be so touchy.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.113
Oh, I have no problem
with people thinking I'’m gay.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.680
I just don'’t want them thinking

13:31.723 --> 13:33.377
that I couldn'’t do
any better than you.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.774
Oh, man! I forgot
about my steak.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.299
Do you think it'’s
still safe to eat?

13:42.343 --> 13:44.736
[groans]
Would it stop you if I said no?

13:46.608 --> 13:47.957
Hey.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.437
Hey. How was dinner?

13:49.480 --> 13:51.352
Oh, good.
We saved you some cake.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.834
Hey! Cake and steak--
let'’s eat it in bed.

13:54.877 --> 13:58.098
If you think you'’re happy now,
I'’ve got a potato in my pocket.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.844
I know I'’ve said I'm sorry,
like, a thousand times,

14:04.887 --> 14:06.323
but I really, really am sorry.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.457
Hey, it'’s my birthday for...

14:09.500 --> 14:12.112
two more hours,
so what do you say

14:12.155 --> 14:14.723
we go upstairs
and, uh...
Oh...

14:14.766 --> 14:16.246
we can'’t.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.682
Jill was afraid to be alone,

14:17.726 --> 14:19.684
so we had to bring
her back with us,

14:19.728 --> 14:21.469
and she kind of
passed out in my bed.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.297
Oh.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.776
But the sofa pulls out.

14:24.820 --> 14:28.345
We can have
super hot, quiet sex

14:28.389 --> 14:30.870
that people might walk in on.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.047
Yeah, th-that doesn'’t sound
super hot to me.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.354
Oh, I-I promise,
tomorrow I am all yours.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.269
Christy, please, stop...

14:39.313 --> 14:41.706
making promises.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.056
You'’re mad, aren't you?

14:43.099 --> 14:46.755
Yeah, I-I'’m mad.
Uh, your mom said

14:46.798 --> 14:49.540
that she could handle things
tonight, but you went anyway.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.934
You said it was okay.
Well, because who wants
to sit through dinner

14:51.978 --> 14:53.631
with somebody who doesn'’t
want to be there?

14:53.675 --> 14:55.851
Although my brother just did,
and he really enjoyed it.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.986
I don'’t know
how else to explain it,

15:00.029 --> 15:02.902
but that Jill really needed me.
Yeah.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.078
It'’s late,
I'’m-I'm tired,

15:05.121 --> 15:07.689
so... let'’s just
go to bed, okay?

15:09.647 --> 15:10.692
It'’s-It's kind of tricky.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.172
You have to push and then pull.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.260
I-I got it.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.351
[strained grunt]

15:17.394 --> 15:19.788
PATRICK:
Ow! My fingers!

15:19.831 --> 15:22.486
[laughs]:
He'’s so miserable.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.706
Mmm.
You know that part of you

15:24.749 --> 15:26.926
that takes pleasure
in other people'’s pain?
Yeah.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.580
Mmm.
Totally turns me on.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.238
Oh, my God,

15:35.282 --> 15:37.806
Adam, you'’re walking--
it'’s a miracle!

15:39.634 --> 15:41.636
No. Uh... not Adam.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.638
I'’m his brother, Patrick.

15:43.681 --> 15:46.467
Oh, yeah.
That makes more sense.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.165
Coffee, please?

15:49.209 --> 15:51.211
Little agave?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.647
You must be Jill.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.520
Thank you.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.218
How'’d you hurt your hand?

15:58.261 --> 16:01.786
Oh.
I, uh... lost a fight

16:01.830 --> 16:03.484
with a pullout couch.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.268
Oh, I took your bed, didn'’t I?

16:05.312 --> 16:06.835
Kinda.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.880
I wasn'’t always
a mess like this.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.840
I mean...

16:11.883 --> 16:14.016
I was and then I wasn'’t...

16:14.060 --> 16:17.280
and then I got fat
and then I got skinny...

16:17.324 --> 16:19.674
and now I'’m a mess again.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.545
Go figure.

16:21.589 --> 16:22.938
Sorry to hear that.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.244
Thanks.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.335
You know, in the past...

16:28.378 --> 16:30.990
every time I relapsed,
I was able to get back,

16:31.033 --> 16:33.818
but this time I'’m just...

16:33.862 --> 16:35.995
I'’m just kind of lost.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.433
Thank God I have Christy.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.435
[chuckles softly]
She took hold of me

16:41.478 --> 16:43.785
the very first time
I walked into a meeting,

16:43.828 --> 16:45.482
and she'’s been right there
ever since.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.617
I don'’t know
what I'’d do without her.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.360
Yeah, she'’s, uh...

16:53.403 --> 16:56.015
she'’s pretty special.
[chuckles]

16:58.582 --> 17:01.324
You know, for only having
eight working fingers,

17:01.368 --> 17:03.805
you make great coffee.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.155
Thanks. Just don'’t ask me
to shoot a basketball.

17:06.199 --> 17:09.767
Why would I ask you
to shoot a basketball?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.468
Oh, hey.
You two met.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.991
[chuckles]
Yeah.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.036
He'’s a good one.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.341
Aw. Hey, uh, Christy,

17:18.385 --> 17:20.082
you got a minute?

17:20.126 --> 17:21.823
Uh, sure.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.523
Before you say anything,

17:26.567 --> 17:29.091
she'’s leaving, and you and I
are gonna have our day together.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.875
Yeah, about that, um...

17:32.703 --> 17:34.531
I'’m gonna go home.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.620
You'’re still mad.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.274
No, I'’m not mad.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.059
I get it.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.670
Your friend'’s in trouble
and she needs you.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.715
But?

17:44.759 --> 17:49.024
I just don'’t know
where I fit in here.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.723
I know this has not been
the ideal weekend,

17:52.767 --> 17:56.292
but you got to understand,
helping people stay sober

17:56.336 --> 17:59.078
is part of what
helps mestay sober.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.515
So it has to come first.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.300
Well, I guess that means
I'’ll always be second.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.087
I'’m crazy about you.

18:08.130 --> 18:11.568
But if I don'’t stay sober,
there isno second.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.136
Well...

18:14.180 --> 18:16.921
I don'’t know...

18:16.965 --> 18:19.924
if this is gonna
work for me.

18:19.968 --> 18:20.925
Oh.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.712
Where does that leave us?

18:28.629 --> 18:31.110
I'’m not sure.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.808
You know, let'’s talk
in a few days, okay?

18:33.851 --> 18:35.288
Okay.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.272
I feel asleep on cake.

19:05.709 --> 19:06.667
What'’s wrong?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.149
Patrick just left.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.716
Already?
Yeah.

19:12.760 --> 19:16.111
Too much AA, not enough Christy.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.029
[sighs]:
Oh.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.468
Don'’t worry, honey, he'll...
he'’ll get over it.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.035
I don'’t know.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.214
[Jill clears throat]

19:32.258 --> 19:34.477
I'’m trying to piece together

19:34.521 --> 19:36.131
what happened last night.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.917
Did I go to Mexico?

19:50.276 --> 19:51.625
Look at this.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.627
Homemade apricot jam
from Gloria.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.412
Somebody just got invited
to the wedding.

19:56.456 --> 19:59.023
We give away chips for
various lengths of sobriety.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.112
Our chip person is Marjorie.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.202
Hi. Marjorie. Alcoholic.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.638
OTHERS:
Hi, Marjorie.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.379
Would anyone like
a newcomer chip?

20:11.079 --> 20:14.604
I'’m not taking another one--
it'’s too embarrassing.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.259
You have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.609
What if I take a newcomer
chip at every meeting

20:19.653 --> 20:21.481
for the rest of my life?

20:21.524 --> 20:22.786
MAN:
I'’m an alcoholic.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.571
Then I'’ll be
right here with you.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.096
MARJORIE:
Anyone else want

20:28.139 --> 20:29.619
to take a newcomer chip?

20:38.062 --> 20:40.021
What'’s your name, honey?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.067
Oh, right.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.768
Hi. I'’m Jill,
and I'’m an alcoholic.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.422
OTHERS:
Hi, Jill.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.598
Okay.

20:51.641 --> 20:54.644
Would anyone like to
take a chip for 30 days?
