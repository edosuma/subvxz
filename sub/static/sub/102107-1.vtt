01:04.400 --> 01:05.480

01:31.240 --> 01:34.480
Graduate engineer Isabel Nylund,
please step forward.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.720

GRADUATION CEREMONY

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
Thanks.

01:59.000 --> 01:59.840
Cheers!

01:59.920 --> 02:01.360
Cheers!

02:05.720 --> 02:06.680
Hi.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.680
I'm so proud of you.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.120
I can't believe it's over.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.840
Thank you for waiting.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.880
Driving back and forth to this dump.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.640
Well… now it's your turn to wait for me.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.120
Are you okay?

02:27.160 --> 02:30.200
-With what?
-Moving to Stockholm with me.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.000
Yes, of course.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
It will be great.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.040
-I need to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.480
GENTS

03:05.840 --> 03:09.480
"Skrubbsår" with Magnus Rehn,
requested by Erik for Tove.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.680
They celebrate three years together.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.200
This is music and romance on Mix Megapol.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.560
We now have another lovebird
with a special greeting.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.200
Hello. My name's David.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.040
Hi. Who do you want to send some love to?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.520
My girlfriend, Nadja.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.920
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.920
No worries, but hurry up.
We don't have much time left.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.200
Oh, shit. Okay.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.280
Nadja, you are the best thing, and…

03:40.360 --> 03:43.040
-What song would you like?
-Just a second…

03:45.160 --> 03:48.680
Everything is about to begin
for you and me, and…

03:50.880 --> 03:52.640
Shit, this is stressful.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.280
"If you were an ocean"…

03:56.240 --> 03:57.440
"I would be a wave."

03:58.480 --> 04:01.000
"If you were the sky, I would have wings."

04:01.080 --> 04:04.280
Lovely.
Here is "Om" with Niklas Strömstedt.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.320
No, wait.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.800
Nadja, will you…

04:12.320 --> 04:13.440
Will you marry me?

04:20.520 --> 04:21.360
Damn.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.760
Damn it.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.800
You're crazy.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.800
Proposing to me
in the filthiest restroom in Sweden.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.880
Are you…?

04:47.960 --> 04:50.360
Are you sad sad or happy sad?

04:52.840 --> 04:55.640
Of course I'll marry you!

04:57.600 --> 04:58.560
Yes.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.280
Excuse me. That was beautiful.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.560
Thanks.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.280
-Great news about the job, David.
-Thanks.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.960
-It's you and me now.
-Whatever happens.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.920
It all begins here.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.720
1.5 YEARS LATER

05:39.400 --> 05:41.400
For fuck's sake!

05:46.320 --> 05:48.000
Fucking hell!

05:50.440 --> 05:51.280
Hello!

05:53.640 --> 05:56.080
Can you give me a hand? I have to study!

05:56.160 --> 05:59.080
I want to be a doctor,
not a fucking housewife.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.840
-Why are you so mad?
-I'm fed up with nagging.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.800
You said you'd fix it,
but the lid's still broken.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.840
I know. I haven't had the time.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.400
But you have time to play Battlefreed.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.960
It's called Battlefield.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.880
Whatever. I'll do it.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.040
Just like I do everything else.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.800
Come on.
I work all the time. I need to chill.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.600
Move out, then.
It wouldn't make any difference.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.680
-I'll fix it now.
-No, it's too late.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.320
-What do you want me to do?
-Maybe you should consider other people.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.600
What do you mean? I work nonstop.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.560
Everything I do is for us.
It was for us that I…

06:42.840 --> 06:44.120
Yeah, that went well.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.440
Yeah, go on. Run away.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.680
You're damn good at that.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.320
A fucking champion!

07:37.240 --> 07:39.160
-Tomas…
-Oh, sorry.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.920
No, I'm sorry.
I've probably taken your slot.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
-I'll stop it.
-No, I can come back later.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.040
-It's fine.
-No.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.680
Hang on.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.720
Are you okay?

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
Sorry. I'm…

08:03.320 --> 08:05.160
It's not a stomach bug.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.760
Poor you. What's going on?

08:14.840 --> 08:15.920
I'm pregnant.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.960
-You're having a child?
-Don't say anything. I haven't told David.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.360
I'm not sure if we…

08:27.400 --> 08:28.800
should become parents.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.080
Everything's become so…

08:37.360 --> 08:38.200
What?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.760
I don't know.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.320
It feels like I have to do everything.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.400
David works all the time,
and I have to do everything, and…

08:52.320 --> 08:55.560
If we have a baby,
I'll end up on my own with it.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.600
I don't want to be a fucking housewife.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.200
Housewife? You?

09:04.200 --> 09:07.920
Yes. I remember what it was like.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.480
"How can I have a child when I'm not
much more than a child myself?"

09:19.120 --> 09:21.720
Having a child
is the greatest thing in life.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.720
At the same time,
you worry about losing it.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.920
-Sorry, I didn't mean to…
-Don't worry. I asked you.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.160
Right.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.760
I'm sure you and David
will be amazing parents.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.080
You're a responsible person.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.560
I'm sure you will do
what feels right for you.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.040
Tomas. Thanks.

09:52.680 --> 09:56.080
-You're always so kind.
-That's what neighbors are for.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.440
Okay.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.400
I'll come back later.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.080
Come on, Boris.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.880
MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM

11:04.640 --> 11:06.760
MEET ME ON THE STAIRS

11:17.400 --> 11:19.360
MEET ME BY THE CAR

11:19.440 --> 11:21.120
You think Mom will be happy?

11:29.240 --> 11:30.560
Stay, Boris.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.000
Sorry.

11:37.080 --> 11:37.920
What's this?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.760
I thought we could get away for a while

11:43.600 --> 11:45.320
and spend some time together.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.440
Bear Valley?

11:47.520 --> 11:52.480
Yes. Hiking in the mountains
and camping under the northern lights.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.960
-Will you have time?
-I called in sick.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.640
Has David Daftander called in sick?

12:03.680 --> 12:06.480
I may have the world's best job,

12:06.560 --> 12:09.520
but I don't want to lose
the world's best girl.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.440
-That was rather soppy.
-Maybe it was a bit over the top.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.480
Soppy? This is Don Juan Daftander.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
Okay?

12:55.720 --> 12:56.800
I'm just carsick.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.720
-My God.
-Sorry.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.640
-What are you doing?
-Easy, boy.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.040
-Should I drive?
-No, I'll drive.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.640
Come.

13:49.960 --> 13:50.800
Hello.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.080
-Can I say hello?
-Sure.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.240
Hello. Yes.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.800
Can you smell game?

14:04.440 --> 14:06.560
I have a dog, too. A German Shepherd.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.760
Damn fine creatures.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.200
No. Boris, calm down.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.560
Who's a pretty boy, then?

14:16.640 --> 14:17.840
Yes, you are.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.800
Yes! You're a pretty boy.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.360
Yeah, right. Good.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.640
Your girl's pretty, too.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.240
-Yes, she is. Thanks.
-Just kidding.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.320
-There. Come.
-Come on.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.000
Come on.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.280
Boris. What…?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.760
Boris, what are you doing?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.520
No, not here. No.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.440
Boris, come on. No. Down.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
Come here.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.720
-Holy shit.
-What?

15:14.280 --> 15:17.280
There's a bloody reindeer head
in that pickup.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.520
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.440
Reindeer for dinner tonight.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.360
-Damn.
-For fuck's sake.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.200
-David.
-It's cool. They won't notice it.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
I'm just going to…

15:44.440 --> 15:46.920
-Should I tell them?
-They won't notice it.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.280
What the hell…? Here.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.880
There. Come on, boy.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.000
Hi.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.400
We have a reservation. Daftander.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.320
Hello?

16:28.640 --> 16:30.120
What's up with you, sis?

16:30.200 --> 16:31.440
What's going on?

16:33.240 --> 16:38.520
Hi, there. Sorry about Mona.
She doesn't like strangers.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.800
She's not a racist, but…

16:42.880 --> 16:46.600
Welcome. What can I do for you?

16:46.680 --> 16:50.800
We have a reservation. David Daftander.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.960
Here you are.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.480
Well, let's see, then.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.720
Three nights.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.920
-But not tomorrow?
-No, we'll camp out and hike a bit.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.800
-How nice. See the northern lights.
-Yes, exactly.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.400
Well,
there's no guarantee you'll see them.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.480
We get Chinese people
coming from the other side of the planet

17:15.560 --> 17:19.400
with cameras,
and they leave without seeing them.

17:20.880 --> 17:26.080
But you might be lucky.
It's fucking beautiful.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.440
But put your phones away.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.880
The northern lights are not for cameras.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.600
They are for making love.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.600
And that's a nice way to keep warm.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.800
I'll remember that.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.200
Yeah, but it's not a joke.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.640
You have to stick together.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.560
The nighttime cold is no joke.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.800
But I'm scaring the shit out of you.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.680
Don't be scared. It's quiet out there.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.120
-Right, the keys.
-Yes. Thanks.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.040
Daftander.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.360
-Mona.
-Yes.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.400
Northerners.

18:05.040 --> 18:05.880
They are…

18:05.960 --> 18:08.400
What do you call it when people are quiet?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.440
Right, here are your keys.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.280
Room 369. Through the main door,
to the left, and up the road.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.080
And here's a map.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.520
This is the hiking trail.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.440
If you get fed up
with the cold and hiking,

18:23.520 --> 18:25.920
I invite hikers into my cottage.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.480
I can offer cold beer and a sauna.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.760
-Cool.
-Thanks.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.680
I wish you a good night.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.160
-Thanks.
-You too.

18:55.800 --> 18:56.800
Okay, run.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.440
What the fuck?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.440
DARKIE IN CAR

19:19.440 --> 19:20.280
Hey, they…

19:21.120 --> 19:21.960
What's wrong?

19:28.840 --> 19:30.960
What the fuck's wrong with people?

19:31.040 --> 19:34.480
If you'd talked to them,
it wouldn't have happened.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.720
-Honey, it was just a tiny scratch.
-Sure.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.280
-Stop!
-What?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.680
Stop the car!

19:55.080 --> 19:57.760
-Is it theirs?
-Fucking racists.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.800
-Where's the screwdriver?
-Leave it. Please.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.320
They might come back.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.640
What…?

20:20.040 --> 20:21.080
Why are you here?

20:21.640 --> 20:23.760
What? Why are you scratching the car?

20:24.280 --> 20:26.160
Go to hell, fucking racist!

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
Run!

20:30.280 --> 20:31.600
-Run!
-Drive!

20:35.240 --> 20:36.240
-Drive!
-Yes!

20:40.680 --> 20:41.520
What the fuck?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.520
That felt damn good.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.560
But was it a good idea?

20:54.280 --> 20:56.360
A scratch for a scratch. It's only fair.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.040
Sit, Boris.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.080
-Easy, boy.
-Sit.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.600
Come.

21:25.960 --> 21:26.880
Watch your head.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.840
There we are.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.280
Right.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.000
Check this out.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.920
-Boris!
-Wait for me!

22:05.000 --> 22:07.600
-Slow down, Boris.
-David!

22:07.680 --> 22:08.520
Honey!

22:29.760 --> 22:31.320
-Let's stop here.
-Here?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.720
-Yes, I'm exhausted.
-Okay.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.640
Come on!

22:38.160 --> 22:39.960
Do you have the instructions?

22:40.040 --> 22:41.520
Inside my brain.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.440
David, seriously. Surely you brought…

22:47.040 --> 22:50.080
-These four…
-Here's the fifth.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.840
-Where does this go?
-Up your ass.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.800
Yeah? But when I ask…

23:01.600 --> 23:04.040
I need to find where this…

23:05.640 --> 23:08.600
Where this…
It seems logical that it should…

23:10.080 --> 23:14.200
-In there. And then fold it.
-You drive me crazy.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.600
What was that?

23:44.480 --> 23:45.320
You dork.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.760
What the hell?

23:58.520 --> 24:01.280
There's a musical wolf
here in the mountains.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.560
Ha ha. Very funny.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.920
-Hi.
-No. You fatty.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.240
-David.
-No, can I…

24:23.000 --> 24:24.600
I just want to say that I…

24:26.120 --> 24:27.160
I'm pregnant.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.160
What?

24:35.440 --> 24:38.920
Shit. What… Are you sure?

24:40.360 --> 24:42.320
I've done five tests.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.320
What…?

24:44.920 --> 24:45.760
Great.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.400
So, we're having a baby.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.880
You really think so?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.800
I know I've done…

24:59.880 --> 25:00.840
-David.
-What?

25:08.480 --> 25:09.600
Right…

25:10.360 --> 25:11.200
Easy.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.280
Hello?

25:19.080 --> 25:19.920
Boris.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.560
Hello?

25:25.800 --> 25:26.640
Easy, Boris.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.680
No, but… Quiet, Boris. Easy.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.960
What are you doing? Going outside?

25:33.040 --> 25:35.400
-It's probably some damn kid.
-Kid? Here?

25:35.480 --> 25:36.800
I'll go and check.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.360
Hello?

26:04.280 --> 26:05.120
What the fuck?

26:07.720 --> 26:09.280
Where's it coming from? Hello?

26:10.560 --> 26:12.760
-Some damn kids.
-Up here?

26:13.960 --> 26:15.640
Honey, it's on you. Move.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.880
Hello! Stop it!

26:20.360 --> 26:21.520
Fuck.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.720
Hello?

26:25.040 --> 26:26.800
-Stop it!
-It's not funny.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.120
Hello? Who's there? Stop it!

26:29.200 --> 26:30.800
Easy, boy. Stop it!

26:37.240 --> 26:38.240
Hello. Stop it!

26:39.240 --> 26:40.440
-Shit!
-Are you okay?

26:40.520 --> 26:41.760
-Yes.
-Sorry.

26:43.040 --> 26:43.920
Stop it!

26:49.080 --> 26:50.640
Fucking laser man.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.600
Very funny.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.440
Let's get our stuff and move.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.560
-It's the middle of the night.
-Never mind. Easy, boy.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.520
Easy, boy. Okay.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.640
-Easy, boy.
-It's okay, sweetie.

27:16.960 --> 27:17.800
David…

27:21.480 --> 27:22.880
-Hello?
-David.

27:35.880 --> 27:36.800
No, Boris!

27:38.760 --> 27:39.800
Boris!

27:49.320 --> 27:50.400
Seriously?

27:50.480 --> 27:51.320
Boris?

27:52.880 --> 27:53.720
Boris!

27:56.200 --> 27:57.680
Do you think…?

28:02.400 --> 28:04.840
-We've got to get out of here.
-Run!

28:28.240 --> 28:29.080
What the fuck?

28:35.680 --> 28:36.680
What is this?

28:36.760 --> 28:37.960
What's going on?

28:39.920 --> 28:41.120
Come on!

28:41.840 --> 28:42.680
Run!

28:46.320 --> 28:47.360
Down!

29:12.560 --> 29:13.400
What's wrong?

29:13.480 --> 29:15.480
Ouch. It's nothing.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.440
I don't know.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.240
Damn.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.760
Come on!

29:27.400 --> 29:28.880
Down here.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.240
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.120
-This is sick!
-There are two of them.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.200
-What the fuck's going on?
-I don't know.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.240
It must be those inbred brothers.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.040
It's Boris!

30:17.120 --> 30:17.960
Wait.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.160
What are they doing?

30:26.640 --> 30:28.640
It's so sick. What's going on?

30:37.480 --> 30:41.520
They're getting closer.
We've got to move. Come on.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.480
-I've got to go back to the tent.
-We need to get out of here.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.200
Let's get our stuff and call the police.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.000
Let's head to the car.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
-We won't find it from here.
-Damn!

31:15.160 --> 31:16.760
We don't know where we are.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.800
Even if we get to the car,
the keys are in the tent.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.120
We can hot-wire it.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.840
I can't do that. Can you? No.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.720
Wait here.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.040
It's empty.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.760
Phones, everything, all gone.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.680
Don't go inside.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.680
This is totally sick.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.640
I'll fucking kill them.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.400
I'll fucking kill you!

33:49.200 --> 33:50.720
Fuck! Fucking cunts!

33:50.800 --> 33:53.600
Quiet! They can hear you.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.760
We shouldn't have left him.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.000
What have we done?

34:05.600 --> 34:08.800
We haven't done anything.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.480
Nothing. Okay?

34:15.360 --> 34:16.720
I'll look for the keys.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.040
Oh, shit!

34:57.240 --> 34:58.280
Help!

34:59.040 --> 34:59.920
Nadja!

35:01.880 --> 35:03.840
-What should I do?
-Get it off me!

35:03.920 --> 35:06.240
-How?
-Just force it open.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.000
-Fuck.
-Come on!

35:17.960 --> 35:20.200
Please fix this. Help me! Help!

35:21.040 --> 35:23.600
-Put pressure on it!
-Okay.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.920
-Press hard.
-Okay.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.200
Don't look.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.200
You need to go to the hospital.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.520
But you're a doctor. You can…

35:34.600 --> 35:35.800
In four years' time.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.480
-There.
-We just scratched their car.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.280
-Are they still out there?
-I don't know.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.160
-We need to follow our tracks back.
-Okay.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.360
Where the hell are we?

36:50.440 --> 36:51.400
Someone's there.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.360
We must get to the trees.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.200
Fuck you!

37:25.040 --> 37:26.000
One shot.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.480
What?

37:27.560 --> 37:30.480
-One shot. Then they reload.
-What are you saying?

37:34.040 --> 37:37.600
The weapon. I think I saw it in their car.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.240
It's like in Battlefield.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.400
One shot, then you reload.
It takes ten seconds.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.600
Is it like that in real life?

37:49.040 --> 37:50.920
I don't know.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.040
Next time they shoot, we run. Okay?

37:56.920 --> 37:57.760
Okay.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.000
-Come on!
-Go!

38:58.800 --> 38:59.640
David!

39:00.800 --> 39:01.760
David!

39:06.040 --> 39:06.880
David!

39:13.400 --> 39:14.280
David!

39:46.280 --> 39:47.120
Nadja!

39:48.920 --> 39:49.760
Nadja!

39:50.600 --> 39:52.160
David!

39:53.080 --> 39:53.920
Nadja!

39:54.000 --> 39:55.440
Watch out for the ice!

40:02.280 --> 40:03.320
Nadja!

40:05.120 --> 40:06.160
David!

40:07.120 --> 40:08.360
David!

40:14.480 --> 40:16.240
Nadja, where are you?

40:17.800 --> 40:18.800
Nadja!

40:22.000 --> 40:23.320
Watch out for the ice!

40:35.520 --> 40:36.400
Nadja!

40:39.760 --> 40:42.080
David!

40:50.720 --> 40:51.560
Help!

40:52.440 --> 40:53.400
David!

40:54.320 --> 40:55.240
Help me!

40:56.880 --> 40:57.720
Help me!

40:57.800 --> 40:58.720
Help!

41:00.160 --> 41:01.320
I'll grab you!

42:07.440 --> 42:08.280
Help me!

42:08.360 --> 42:09.200
Help me!

42:21.080 --> 42:23.200
Have you been hit?

43:10.880 --> 43:12.200
Take off your clothes.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.600
Get them off.

43:37.840 --> 43:38.840
How does it look?

43:55.040 --> 43:57.360
Mountain Rescue. How can I help?

43:57.440 --> 43:58.280
Help!

43:58.360 --> 44:01.080
Help will be on the way
as soon as the storm subsides.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.680
Try to stay still, okay?

44:04.680 --> 44:05.680
How does it look?

44:08.720 --> 44:09.720
It'll be fine.

44:13.760 --> 44:17.600
-Do you know what you're doing?
-I failed the sewing classes.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.760
But I have "sew-philis."

44:24.680 --> 44:26.720
-Ouch!
-Bad joke.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.360
Okay.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.720
Okay.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.520
How are you?

46:50.960 --> 46:51.800
Can I…?

46:57.320 --> 46:58.160
Hang on.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.000
Oh, my God.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.600
It's beating fast. Is it supposed to?

47:12.680 --> 47:13.560
I think so.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.080
Like a hamster.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.960
Are we having a little hamster?
Harald the hamster?

47:54.240 --> 47:55.440
-They're here.
-What?

47:55.520 --> 47:56.520
They're here.

48:07.960 --> 48:08.800
Hello!

48:08.880 --> 48:10.400
It's the racist brother.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.880
He's a mountain rescuer.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.960
This can't be fucking true.

48:25.480 --> 48:26.320
-Hurry!
-Yeah.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.640
Go!

49:01.520 --> 49:02.360
Damn.

49:03.600 --> 49:04.760
Come on.

49:07.960 --> 49:08.800
Come on.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.880
Hey!

49:14.600 --> 49:15.480
Come on.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.240
Hello?

49:23.160 --> 49:24.240
I can't go on.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.600
Come on!

51:16.560 --> 51:17.400
David!

51:26.640 --> 51:28.880
Are you okay? Hey?

51:30.280 --> 51:31.360
Take it easy.

51:31.880 --> 51:36.440
Breathe. Look at me. Breathe.

51:37.080 --> 51:37.920
Breathe.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.000
Okay.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.320
Breathe.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.240
What's happening?

51:49.800 --> 51:53.600
-He's in my head all the time.
-Breathe.

51:53.680 --> 51:57.200
-Breathe.
-You were right. We should have called.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.520
Where the hell are we?

52:08.040 --> 52:08.880
Look.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.480
We came down here.
This must be the emergency shelter.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.520
It can't be far to that barman's house.

52:22.280 --> 52:24.440
-Can you make it?
-Yes.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.720
Do you see that?

53:19.880 --> 53:23.080
I can't get him out of my mind.
I see him all the time.

53:23.160 --> 53:25.200
-Okay.
-Why didn't I listen to you?

53:31.680 --> 53:33.400
I don't deserve to be a dad.

53:35.360 --> 53:36.640
Don't say that.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.600
Stop it.

53:40.160 --> 53:43.160
The cottage is over there.
It's not far to go.

53:44.360 --> 53:45.360
Come on.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.400
Don't you get it? It's a sign.

53:47.480 --> 53:50.200
We don't deserve this.
We can't become parents.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.520
-I don't deserve this.
-Don't say that.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.480
-We don't deserve it.
-Stop it.

53:54.560 --> 53:57.480
David, listen to me.
It's not far to go. Come on.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.400
When we get home, we tell the police.

54:03.800 --> 54:04.880
It's not too late.

54:08.880 --> 54:09.800
Okay?

54:16.160 --> 54:17.720
Come on. Get up.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.160
Come on.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.040
Come on!

54:32.000 --> 54:33.120
I can't do it.

54:36.200 --> 54:38.840
I can't go on. I can't walk.

54:39.560 --> 54:40.400
Okay.

54:42.560 --> 54:45.120
I'll see if anyone's in and ask for help.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.480
Hi!

55:20.280 --> 55:22.760
What happened? What are you doing?

55:44.200 --> 55:48.080
I had to do it.
He was going to shoot you. Right?

55:49.320 --> 55:51.280
He was going to shoot you, right?

55:51.360 --> 55:52.760
Come.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.240
David!

56:49.920 --> 56:51.280
Hello?

56:58.160 --> 56:59.160
Fuck.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.360
Up!

57:07.080 --> 57:08.160
Don't fall asleep.

57:11.560 --> 57:14.120
-Hey! Call an ambulance.
-What happened?

57:14.720 --> 57:15.920
Call for help.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.040
I'll call.

57:20.960 --> 57:24.480
You'll be fine.
Don't fall asleep. Look at me.

57:25.560 --> 57:26.520
It'll be fine.

57:26.600 --> 57:27.640
Yes, it's me.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.080
They're here now.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.600
Thanks. Yeah.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.160
Hurry up!

57:42.360 --> 57:43.200
That's fine.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.880
What are you doing?

57:54.960 --> 57:55.840
Wait…

57:57.160 --> 57:58.160
What?

57:59.440 --> 58:00.360
They're here soon.

58:01.200 --> 58:04.880
Sit down and wait. Help will arrive soon.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.040
What's wrong?

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
We must go. Come.

58:11.080 --> 58:11.920
Wait.

58:13.120 --> 58:14.800
Wait!

58:16.480 --> 58:18.360
It'll be over soon.

58:18.440 --> 58:21.920
I promise. It'll be over soon.
Nothing will happen to you.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.920
-Get in!
-It'll soon be over.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.440
What the hell did we do?

58:26.040 --> 58:27.400
Just take it easy.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.000
I don't wish you any harm.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.360
One has to help one's family.

58:35.280 --> 58:39.320
-We just scratched a car!
-I don't know what you're talking about.

58:40.720 --> 58:41.640
Stop it!

58:43.280 --> 58:44.560
I can't take anymore.

58:48.480 --> 58:49.440
Nadja.

58:50.880 --> 58:51.720
Nadja!

59:02.440 --> 59:03.280
What…?

59:28.960 --> 59:30.880
His eyes were so full of life.

59:33.640 --> 59:34.600
Tomas…?

59:35.720 --> 59:39.800
I can't stop thinking of
what he would look like now.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.760
Have you ever thought of that?

59:47.520 --> 59:51.800
He's lying there
in his little coffin in the ground.

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.480
Where is he now?

1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:07.520
So, what did you do, Nadja?

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:11.280
I would like you to tell me.

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:12.520
Tomas, we…

1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:16.760
Tell me.

1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:19.680
Of course I'll marry you.

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:24.800
-It's you and me now.
-Whatever happens.

1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:26.160
It all begins here.

1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:31.080
I can't believe you proposed to me
in that dirty restroom.

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:33.960
I meant to do it in the café,
but you came down.

1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:36.680
-So, it was your fault.
-I can be dirty, too.

1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:42.880
-Wait. I'll stop.
-Drive. It's sexy.

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.560
What's with the chastity belt?

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:50.520
I know, it's hard. Or… It's not…

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:02.800
What the fuck was that?

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:09.040
-Oh, my God!
-No. Wait, Nadja. No!

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.080
What the hell?

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:37.840
No!

1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:59.400
It was a little boy. He…

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:02.800
He's… dead.

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:05.560
Everything was supposed to begin now.

1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:11.480
What are you doing?

1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:14.920
Well, I think…

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:18.800
Let's just drive for a bit
and think this through.

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:23.720
-We can't…
-We must call the police.

1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:24.880
Let's just drive.

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:27.720
We need to think about it.

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:29.600
We can call later.

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:33.360
It's okay.

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:46.240
I can't cope. I'll call the police.
I'll tell them it was us.

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:48.280
-No. Don't do anything rash.
-Yes.

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:51.000
Hang on. We don't even know if he…

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:57.080
David, he was fucking dead.
I saw his face. I can't live with this.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:00.280
Listen. It was me. I was driving.

1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:02.760
I'll end up in prison if you call them.

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:04.600
No…

1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:06.840
I'm also guilty.

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:09.120
Hang on. We…

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.800
No. Listen to me.

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:12.160
Listen!

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.640
It was me. Only me.
You didn't do anything.

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:19.680
Emergency services. Anyone there?

1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:21.640
-Hang on…
-Hello?

1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:24.280
-Let me do it myself.
-Hello?

1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:25.680
I just need some time.

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:31.960
I will. I promise.

1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:43.400
It's quite incredible
how you just move on.

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.120
Continue.

1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:47.480
As if nothing's happened.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.600
I've tried to understand
what kind of fucking people you are.

1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:57.000
Check it out!

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:48.000
Tomas.

1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:51.960
Did you see anything?

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:39.960
CHECK VEHICLE INFORMATION

1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:44.640
OWNER/USER

1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:50.000
Do you know anything
that could be of help?

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:52.320
Anything at all?

1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:08.200
Don't say that.

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:21.720
-Need help?
-No.

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.080
-Are you sure?
-They're heavy.

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:27.080
I'm moving in up there.

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:29.200
-That's right opposite us.
-I see.

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:31.600
-Those two windows.
-Great.

1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:33.960
-We can wave to each other.
-Yes.

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:42.640
-Hi.
-Hello.

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:44.360
I couldn't help myself.

1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:46.840
Bicycle is not spelled with an s.

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:48.600
Thanks.

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.600
-You're so kind.
-What else are neighbors for?

1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:58.320
I wanted to give you this.

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:01.880
-You were so kind when I moved in.
-You really didn't have to do that.

1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:05.440
Bear Valley?

1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:10.440
But this is… Don't you want it yourself?

1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:11.520
No, you take it.

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:16.240
You deserve to suffer like me.

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:25.560
Sit down.

1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:31.400
-Please…
-Sit down!

1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:38.760
Tomas, please.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:41.560
I'm so sorry.

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:45.800
I'm so terribly sorry.

1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:57.080
I'll go to the police
and tell them everything.

1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:09.440
-Bye, David.
-Tomas, please.

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:12.040
This isn't you.

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.880
I would have wanted to kill us, too.

1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:19.040
We shouldn't have left.
We should have gone back.

1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:22.960
What we did was… It is unforgivable, but…

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:28.760
we're having a baby.

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.800
Do you remember what you said?

1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:37.880
That suddenly you have everything…

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:40.240
everything to lose.

1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:42.200
Good morning.

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:45.800
Einar. She's awake now.

1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:49.160
Did you get hold of her?

1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:51.520
She wouldn't want to miss this.

1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:55.760
Einar?

1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:59.640
I'm calling, but there's no answer.

1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:03.080
There's a problem with my sister's phone.

1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:06.560
For fuck's sake.

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:08.840
Tomas?

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:12.200
-Come on. That's enough.
-Stop it.

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:15.480
This is my moment.

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:22.400
I was going to shoot you.

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:26.160
But then the storm came.

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:27.920
That was lucky.

1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:31.640
You're right, Nadja.

1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:34.880
Killing you wouldn't help anyone.

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:39.240
But why should you get off lightly?

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:44.600
Now when you're carrying
something more valuable

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:46.480
than your pitiful lives?

1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:52.640
Tomas… please.

1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:55.080
You will regret this.

1:10:57.920 --> 1:10:59.800
I don't care about myself.

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:02.520
I can go to jail. My life is over.

1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.280
Please, Tomas.

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:08.720
I understand. I've lived with the guilt.

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:10.360
You don't understand shit.

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:11.360
But you will.

1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:34.840
Let's begin.

1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:48.080
Come on, David.

1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:50.360
You can do this.

1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:53.360
Maybe the mother survives.

1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:57.160
What do you want me to do?

1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:05.120
Drill.

1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:18.480
Please…

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:28.920
Do it.

1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:32.120
Why?

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:33.160
I want to share.

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.560
I want you to feel what I feel.

1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:38.760
No.

1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:41.720
If you don't do it, I'll shoot Nadja.

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:43.960
Then both will die.

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:51.160
It's your choice.

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:10.400
Yes.

1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:23.840
Five seconds.

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.680
What the hell are you doing?

1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:38.080
Five.

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:42.040
Four.

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:46.800
Three.

1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:53.200
Two.

1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:57.880
One.

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:09.200
I can't do it.

1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:17.920
Okay.

1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:22.640
Well, then…

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:31.320
It may not be as poetic, but…

1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:34.120
Bye, Nadja.

1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:39.440
Here you are.

1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:46.200
-Do you realize what you've done?
-Call for help.

1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:47.360
Who the hell are you?

1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.320
-Who the hell are you?
-Call the police.

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:52.800
-Jarmo…
-Who's he?

1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:55.120
-Why are you here?
-They're psychopaths.

1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:57.680
-What the hell's going on?
-Hang on.

1:14:57.760 --> 1:14:59.480
-Call for help!
-Take it easy.

1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:01.280
-Help us!
-What are you doing?

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:02.400
Put those down!

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:05.080
-They're not fucking toys.
-What's she talking about?

1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:06.680
Help!

1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:29.920
David!

1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:44.000
Run!

1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:50.040
Damn.

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:03.160
I can't get up.

1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:20.360
I can't go on.

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:21.960
Come on, David.

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.160
Wait. I can't.

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:24.160
Up!

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:26.920
Get up!

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.160
Sorry.

1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:40.840
Sorry.

1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:45.040
It's all my fault.

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:52.280
It can't end like this.

1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:55.760
Get up.

1:16:56.640 --> 1:16:57.520
Get up!

1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:02.800
Please.

1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:06.240
You must get out of here.

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.040
Get out of here. Run!

1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:10.920
I can't.

1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:12.720
You must.

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.200
Do it now.

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:28.520
Run.

1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:32.800
I love you.

1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:34.920
I love you.

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:37.520
Run.

1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:40.720
Run.

1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:43.800
Where is she?

1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:47.920
It wasn't her fault.

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:00.840
Where is she?

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:19.760
I can't keep fleeing.

1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:23.080
This stops now.

1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:38.400
Do you hear?

1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:41.200
This stops now.

1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:56.400
Why are you smiling?

1:19:56.480 --> 1:19:58.800
You should have turned around long ago.

1:20:11.560 --> 1:20:12.400
No.

1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:15.720
No.

1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:39.920
Kill me.

1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:42.960
Please, kill me.

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:46.480
Shoot!

1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:52.120
Honey, it's okay now.

1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:07.280
You'll survive.

1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:10.160
I want you to kill me.

1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:15.120
Now you feel.

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:24.640
I want to die!

1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.160
I know.

1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:37.600
No. Please.

1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:39.440
I understand.

1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:40.600
I understand now.

1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:45.440
Kill me!

1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:50.040
No…

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:52.840
Nadja…

1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:13.040
