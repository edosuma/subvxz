00:44.731 --> 00:46.631
Previously on the 4400...

00:46.660 --> 00:47.904
I'm blacking out.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.992
If you're losing chunks of time,
you should talk to your dad about it.

00:51.020 --> 00:53.145
What's he going to do ?
Turn me over to NTAC medical ?

00:53.169 --> 00:55.019
Let me see if i've got this straight.

00:55.054 --> 01:00.362
You two met, fell in love, and spent eight years
together in some kind of alternative reality ?

01:00.538 --> 01:02.698
Liv, you were pretty far
gone last night.

01:02.722 --> 01:05.375
When i O. D., it's not going
to be any big loss, right ?

01:05.411 --> 01:06.790
Maybe i can save you.

01:06.837 --> 01:09.338
Whatever it is,
there's a way out of it.

01:09.385 --> 01:11.851
That's easy to say.
You don't know what "it" is.

01:13.342 --> 01:16.078
You told me everything
that happened that night, right ?

01:16.524 --> 01:17.158
Yeah.

01:17.581 --> 01:19.974
If you need some time
to clear your head

01:20.009 --> 01:22.557
and get away from everything
so you can figure stuff out,

01:22.592 --> 01:24.201
I can make that happen.

01:24.236 --> 01:24.973
dad,

01:25.290 --> 01:27.099
i had to leave. I'm sorry.

01:31.185 --> 01:33.416
Look, i'm not interested in excuses.

01:33.451 --> 01:36.043
I don't care how you do it,
who you have to lean on,

01:36.078 --> 01:38.438
You just get him out of
lock-up and over to L. A. X.

01:38.462 --> 01:40.000
I want him on
the next plane out.

01:46.134 --> 01:47.508
Skouris, where's Baldwin ?

01:47.543 --> 01:50.056
He's not in yet. Why ?
What's going on ?

01:50.431 --> 01:54.095
L. A. P. D. Is holding some piece of street garbage
who wants to see daylight again.

01:54.142 --> 01:56.735
Says he can make the dealer
who sold the Collier murder weapon.

01:56.770 --> 01:58.414
Who's handling
the l. A. Interview ?

01:58.437 --> 02:01.161
Nobody. I'm having him shipped
up here for questioning.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.390
This one feels good.

02:03.425 --> 02:06.091
My partner's going to
like hearing that.

02:07.465 --> 02:09.543
You can fill me in when
i get to the office.

02:09.566 --> 02:12.905
Look, i know we're not ready
to pop any champagne yet, but

02:12.940 --> 02:17.555
this witness has intel we kept out of the media,
specific details about the Collier murder weapon.

02:17.601 --> 02:19.210
Sounds like we finally
caught a break.

02:19.245 --> 02:20.901
Look, Diana, i really have to go.

02:20.936 --> 02:23.505
Are you okay ?
You sound a little distracted.

02:23.529 --> 02:25.583
It's personal business.
Not your worry.

02:25.607 --> 02:27.568
Well, any idea
what time you'll be in ?

02:27.591 --> 02:29.000
I can't really say just yet.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.405
Look, i'll get in touch with you
as soon as i can, okay ?

02:31.441 --> 02:32.591
Okay, no problem.

02:32.627 --> 02:33.331
Bye.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.924
How long has this been going on ?

02:36.959 --> 02:37.640
Calm down.

02:37.675 --> 02:39.786
No. I asked you a question.
How long ?

02:39.812 --> 02:41.890
Look, Kyle told me, like, a month ago.

02:42.446 --> 02:44.054
Look, you remember that night ?

02:44.078 --> 02:44.735
Wha...

02:45.968 --> 02:47.189
What night ?

02:47.224 --> 02:50.148
The night that he almost got arrested
for smashing that store window.

02:50.298 --> 02:51.261
You mean when he got drunk ?

02:51.296 --> 02:54.126
He never said he was drunk.
You said he was drunk.

02:54.232 --> 02:55.887
Kyle said he blacked out.

02:58.799 --> 03:01.591
It happened a bunch of times
after that. One minute,

03:01.662 --> 03:04.198
he'd be one place, the next thing
he knew, he was someplace else.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.854
He never mentioned it to me.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.803
He never said anything.

03:07.932 --> 03:09.952
Well, he tried once,
but you wouldn't listen.

03:11.305 --> 03:12.737
Look, you could have
come to me, Danny,

03:12.768 --> 03:14.733
Told me what was going on.
He's your cousin, your friend.

03:14.781 --> 03:16.753
Which is why i promised him not to.

03:17.375 --> 03:20.229
The last thing Kyle wanted was to
be thrown back into quarantine.

03:24.448 --> 03:27.102
Danny, Kyle never came
home last night.

03:27.313 --> 03:30.424
If you know where he is,
please, tell me.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.512
He went to stay with Shawn
over at the 4400 center.

03:36.547 --> 03:37.346
Great.

03:37.381 --> 03:38.332
Uncle Tommy...

03:38.908 --> 03:40.551
There's something else
you ought to know.

03:41.538 --> 03:44.027
Kyle thinks he did something
during one of his blackouts.

03:44.062 --> 03:45.897
He wouldn't tell us what it was,

03:45.932 --> 03:47.963
But he really seemed
freaked out about it.

04:55.332 --> 04:57.586
This is the committee
latest recommendation

04:57.622 --> 04:59.559
37-Year-old pipe fitter from Detroit.

04:59.594 --> 05:01.870
He was diagnosed with hodgkin's
disease four months ago.

05:01.905 --> 05:02.926
When do we fly him in ?

05:02.950 --> 05:03.772
Two days from now.

05:03.807 --> 05:04.500
Shawn.

05:04.699 --> 05:05.768
Where is he ?

05:06.296 --> 05:08.069
Who ? Kyle ? He's not here.

05:08.304 --> 05:10.157
Don't play games with me, Shawn.

05:11.696 --> 05:13.210
Can you excuse us, Lucy ?

05:13.422 --> 05:14.114
Thank you.

05:15.159 --> 05:16.803
Danny said Kyle came here.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.538
Yeah, well, Danny needs to check his text
messages, because Kyle never showed.

05:19.562 --> 05:21.541
You're not listening to me, Shawn.
I want my son.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.880
You're not hearing me.

05:23.514 --> 05:26.485
He's not here. Where do you think
i have him stashed, in the basement ?

05:26.520 --> 05:27.586
I wouldn't put it past you.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.747
Oh, my g...
Uncle Tommy !

05:29.923 --> 05:33.516
Just because Kyle is having a rough time
does not make it my fault !

05:33.551 --> 05:34.831
Been known to happen, Shawn.

05:34.852 --> 05:36.238
He's not here !

05:37.858 --> 05:39.197
he's not here.

05:56.016 --> 05:56.661
Kyle ?

06:01.276 --> 06:02.074
Thomas.

06:02.485 --> 06:05.526
I picked this up
in a village outside Barcelona,

06:05.726 --> 06:08.149
And they said it was very special.

06:11.296 --> 06:12.270
What's wrong ?

06:14.255 --> 06:16.169
Kyle never told me any of this.

06:16.486 --> 06:18.637
At least i'm not the only one
out of the loop.

06:19.060 --> 06:22.030
I thought the doctors said he was
fine when he left quarantine.

06:22.066 --> 06:23.064
They did...

06:23.175 --> 06:25.876
But he spent three years with a separate
consciousness living inside of him.

06:25.899 --> 06:28.042
I don't think the doctors
knew what to do with that.

06:28.118 --> 06:29.598
Have you called the police ?

06:29.633 --> 06:33.558
I can't get them involved,
not until i know what Kyle did.

06:34.650 --> 06:35.953
What about Linda ?

06:36.763 --> 06:40.145
Well, she says she hasn't heard from him.
Promises to call if she does.

06:43.951 --> 06:45.713
I'm sorry about all of this.

06:47.897 --> 06:49.388
I'm just glad i'm back.

06:52.123 --> 06:53.027
Where are you going ?

06:53.051 --> 06:55.164
Well, i'm not going
to find him sitting here.

06:55.528 --> 06:56.585
I'll come with you.

06:56.620 --> 06:59.412
No. Look... I'd rather you
stay here by the phone.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.044
This way, if he calls...

07:02.054 --> 07:03.193
You'll be here.

07:04.461 --> 07:05.155
Okay.

07:06.236 --> 07:07.551
I'll stay in touch.

07:10.791 --> 07:13.386
and this guy is some
big-deal media consultant ?

07:13.422 --> 07:14.729
oh, he's more than that.

07:14.765 --> 07:18.181
Keith Petrick has prepped prime
ministers, members of parliament.

07:18.299 --> 07:21.140
I'd say an interview with Sky News
merits a few hours' homework.

07:21.175 --> 07:24.869
So he's going to tell me what ? Just new and
different ways to say "we're not a cult ?"

07:24.986 --> 07:25.726
No,

07:25.926 --> 07:28.286
he's going to teach you
to stay on message.

07:28.509 --> 07:30.810
The british press loves
to play "gotcha."

07:31.800 --> 07:32.446
Keith.

07:33.009 --> 07:34.900
Matthew Ross. Thank you for coming.

07:35.381 --> 07:36.685
This is Shawn Farrell.

07:36.755 --> 07:38.258
Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:38.305 --> 07:38.961
Shawn.

07:40.006 --> 07:41.627
Just one minute. Sorry.

07:47.486 --> 07:49.035
Uncle Tommy came to see me.

07:49.059 --> 07:50.855
Yeah. That's what i figured.
He came here, too.

07:50.891 --> 07:51.760
What'd you tell him ?

07:51.783 --> 07:54.437
Well, the truth.
Kyle ditched us. He never showed.

07:55.775 --> 07:56.491
Listen,

07:56.771 --> 07:58.309
you know, he might still show up.

07:58.568 --> 07:59.807
- You know ?
- Yeah.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.620
I'd give you the big tour, but...

08:01.644 --> 08:03.159
Yeah. No. Things are crazy. I get it.

08:03.194 --> 08:05.671
Wait, just wait, just wait.
Liv. Liv. Hey.

08:06.826 --> 08:07.977
This is Danny, my brother.

08:08.012 --> 08:08.892
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:08.916 --> 08:10.642
This is Liv.
She's one of our first keys.

08:10.665 --> 08:12.027
Actually, i'm second key now.

08:12.063 --> 08:12.755
Really ?

08:12.967 --> 08:14.916
I'm impressed. Star pupil.

08:14.957 --> 08:17.657
Hey, do you think
you could give him a tour ?

08:17.693 --> 08:18.973
You know, Shawn, you don't have to...

08:18.996 --> 08:21.835
I want you to see the place.
Just hold on. Is that cool ?

08:22.047 --> 08:23.209
Sure. Yeah.

08:23.350 --> 08:24.207
It's cool.

08:24.231 --> 08:25.851
You two kids have fun.

08:26.203 --> 08:27.838
I've got to... I have to
go back to work, so...

08:30.639 --> 08:32.734
That's my brother,
off to heal the world.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.554
Somebody has to.

08:35.094 --> 08:36.043
You ready ?

08:36.078 --> 08:37.510
Yeah. I'm all yours.

08:40.375 --> 08:43.251
I know who sold the rifle
that killed Collier.

08:43.393 --> 08:44.612
That's a start.

08:45.093 --> 08:46.268
Does we have a name ?

08:48.076 --> 08:49.450
Victor Rios.

08:50.013 --> 08:53.110
R- I-O-S.

08:54.836 --> 08:56.985
He lives at 43207

08:57.009 --> 08:58.559
Sumac Drive.

08:59.627 --> 09:01.294
S- U-M-A-C...

09:01.329 --> 09:02.550
I've got it. Thank you.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.331
I'm at Victor's place last month.

09:06.378 --> 09:08.787
He gets all cranked up and starts
waving this cannon around

09:08.800 --> 09:11.519
Like he's the second coming
of Tony Montana.

09:11.794 --> 09:14.212
He wants to swap it
for some of my product.

09:15.105 --> 09:16.619
I told him i wasn't interested.

09:16.972 --> 09:19.097
Can you describe
the weapon, mr. Kovec ?

09:19.144 --> 09:21.187
I watched him put
that sucker together.

09:21.551 --> 09:24.302
.50 caliber.
Never saw bullets so big.

09:24.877 --> 09:27.625
And it had this humongous
scope on it,

09:27.660 --> 09:30.830
Like a huge neon sign
saying "can't miss."

09:30.866 --> 09:33.368
What makes you so sure this was
the weapon that killed Collier ?

09:34.037 --> 09:35.059
Because...

09:35.247 --> 09:39.685
Next time i saw Rios, he was bragging on
how much he scored for that piece.

09:39.931 --> 09:41.200
This was, like...

09:41.928 --> 09:44.667
Two days before Collier
got taken out.

09:45.195 --> 09:47.497
I figure that's not a coincidence.

09:48.542 --> 09:49.998
What do you think ?

09:53.203 --> 09:56.101
I ask you to give him a quick tour,
and two hours later...

09:56.136 --> 09:58.296
She's a good guide.
Really sells this place.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.480
Danny was expecting
shaved heads and robes.

10:00.515 --> 10:01.842
Yeah. I didn't see
a single tambourine.

10:01.877 --> 10:02.829
Are you disappointed ?

10:02.862 --> 10:04.764
Ah, you don't hear
me complaining.

10:05.269 --> 10:07.300
So, hey, listen, big boss man,

10:07.335 --> 10:09.496
You let your workers off
the farm at night ?

10:09.543 --> 10:12.596
So i invited Liv to a party,
but she's too shy to ask if it's okay.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.802
Think of her like a missionary...

10:14.825 --> 10:17.479
A lot of potential recruits
out there at the northmount campus.

10:17.631 --> 10:20.367
Could be cool. I haven't left
the center in a while.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.427
I don't think it's a good idea.

10:25.237 --> 10:27.938
I'm sorry, man. You're going to have
to find yourself a different date.

10:27.973 --> 10:29.276
Who are you, her warden ?

10:29.297 --> 10:29.897
Danny.

10:33.137 --> 10:36.319
Listen, you guys can hang out here
as much as you want, no problem.

10:36.624 --> 10:38.374
But a kegger,
that's an different story.

10:38.691 --> 10:41.272
The wise and powerful
Shawn has spoken.

10:41.718 --> 10:44.395
I hear and obey, your majesty.

10:46.473 --> 10:47.424
I'm serious.

10:58.249 --> 11:01.065
Since when did Shawn have
such a problem with keggers ?

11:01.440 --> 11:03.906
Since he developed
a messiah complex.

11:08.497 --> 11:10.189
So what time's this party ?

11:12.056 --> 11:12.995
All right.

11:13.512 --> 11:18.138
I woke up in the middle of the night and there
was Kyle, out here, crouching in the hallway.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.171
With no idea how he got there.

11:20.207 --> 11:21.158
That's right.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.600
And i sent him away.

11:25.009 --> 11:25.960
You were, uh..

11:26.721 --> 11:28.717
you were scared.
It's understandable.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.607
Not as scared as he was.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.400
I told him he needed to get help, that
he should talk to you about these blackouts.

11:34.422 --> 11:36.582
I wish he had.
We'd have worked it out.

11:36.817 --> 11:38.238
Well, he wanted to.

11:39.118 --> 11:40.504
Then what stopped him ?

11:42.159 --> 11:45.382
Look, Mr. Baldwin, your relationship
with your son is none of my business...

11:45.412 --> 11:48.159
Agreed, but if you have
something to say, say it.

11:49.779 --> 11:51.846
I'm sure Kyle loves you...

11:52.423 --> 11:54.807
But i don't think he really trusts you.

11:56.544 --> 11:57.563
What ?

11:57.942 --> 11:59.292
He told you that ?

11:59.363 --> 12:00.431
Pretty much.

12:02.578 --> 12:05.901
Eggs, butter, walnuts,
cocoa powder.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.366
Who said making
brownies was difficult ?

12:08.390 --> 12:11.619
Don't forget to preheat
the oven at 350 degrees.

12:11.642 --> 12:12.511
Uh-Oh.

12:12.722 --> 12:15.106
Now things are getting
really complicated.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.043
Relax.

12:17.689 --> 12:19.039
I'm just kidding.

12:24.709 --> 12:25.437
Yeah ?

12:27.398 --> 12:28.267
Now ?

12:30.991 --> 12:34.939
No. That shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to get a sitter first.

12:36.043 --> 12:38.297
If there's a problem,
i'll call you back.

12:38.332 --> 12:41.113
I'm sorry, sweetie, i've got to go
to work. I'll call mrs. Skalka, see...

12:41.148 --> 12:42.970
No, wait. Don't go.

12:43.792 --> 12:46.878
Well, i have to. We can make
brownies another time.

12:48.181 --> 12:49.203
That man...

12:50.212 --> 12:51.517
You don't want to catch him.

12:52.609 --> 12:53.654
What man ?

12:55.838 --> 12:57.646
The man you're chasing after.

12:58.022 --> 12:59.818
Someone's going to get hurt.

13:00.544 --> 13:01.283
Who ?

13:02.657 --> 13:04.383
Is it someone i work with ?

13:04.430 --> 13:06.814
I don't know.
Just don't go.

13:09.608 --> 13:10.947
Are you worried about me ?

13:11.252 --> 13:12.405
Don't go.

13:19.854 --> 13:22.766
Do you think i should get to
my car and head for the border ?

13:23.339 --> 13:24.995
Or ask to be assigned
to another case.

13:26.028 --> 13:28.142
Hmm. Hand the risk
off to another agent ?

13:28.365 --> 13:29.668
It's not an option.

13:32.533 --> 13:33.848
Have you told Tom ?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.632
No, not yet. He's been off
the case for a while.

13:37.430 --> 13:40.049
Might be better for his health
if he stays that way.

13:40.929 --> 13:43.853
She said someone was going to
get hurt, but she didn't say who.

13:44.485 --> 13:45.471
I don't know.

13:46.282 --> 13:48.923
Maia's visions
aren't usually so vague.

13:50.391 --> 13:53.045
This time, she's had a vision
involving her mother.

13:54.606 --> 13:56.910
Maybe she doesn't want
to see it too clearly.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.830
You're not making me
feel any better.

14:03.967 --> 14:04.672
Okay.

14:06.409 --> 14:07.596
How about this ?

14:11.600 --> 14:12.257
Hmm ?

14:12.386 --> 14:13.255
Any better ?

14:13.689 --> 14:14.511
Sure.

14:16.213 --> 14:18.139
You recognize that man,
Mrs. Rios ?

14:18.195 --> 14:19.957
He was a customer
of your husband's.

14:20.238 --> 14:21.084
Husband ?

14:21.871 --> 14:25.193
He got me my green card
and more trouble than i need.

14:25.229 --> 14:27.706
Why don't you ask victor ?
If you can find him.

14:27.753 --> 14:31.352
Yeah, well, that's the problem, Mrs. Rios.
Your husband has left the country.

14:31.387 --> 14:33.078
Now, we know he's in puerto rico.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.921
You see ? You know more than me.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.401
He didn't tell you he was leaving ?

14:36.424 --> 14:37.950
I haven't seen him in two weeks.

14:37.975 --> 14:39.701
Look, i need to get back to work.

14:39.723 --> 14:42.952
A month ago, your husband
qold this man a weapon.

14:43.236 --> 14:45.502
Your husband is implicated
in a murder, Mrs. Rios.

14:45.549 --> 14:47.604
This is not a very good
thing for you.

14:47.815 --> 14:50.058
Particularly if you value
your green card.

14:50.093 --> 14:52.219
Why don't you just take
another look at the sketch ?

15:00.091 --> 15:01.888
I remember the beanie.

15:02.357 --> 15:05.218
Not a regular customer.
He only stopped by once.

15:06.123 --> 15:08.365
He was the one
who bought the big rifle.

15:08.518 --> 15:09.704
And the handgun.

15:10.584 --> 15:11.629
What handgun ?

15:11.688 --> 15:15.445
Uh, you know.
What do you call it ? A 9 mm.

15:15.621 --> 15:16.901
Anything else ?

15:17.887 --> 15:21.375
He was young... In his twenties.
Very quiet.

15:22.936 --> 15:25.519
He only stayed a few minutes,
then left in a taxi.

15:26.061 --> 15:27.188
How do you know that ?

15:27.634 --> 15:29.090
I called it for him.

15:29.736 --> 15:31.192
Oh, we're going to
need that number.

15:32.296 --> 15:34.714
We were in the middle
of a bio-lab practical,

15:34.750 --> 15:37.376
Kyle stood up, said he'd be
right back, and that was it...

15:37.705 --> 15:38.550
Bye-Bye.

15:38.973 --> 15:40.722
Didn't see him again
till the next day.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.718
About what time did he leave ?

15:43.904 --> 15:46.147
Had to be 7:00, 8:00, tops.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.504
He's wrong, as usual.
It was closer to 6:00.

15:48.962 --> 15:51.264
Don't you remember ?
We broke up right after Kyle ditched.

15:51.287 --> 15:52.379
Yeah, look.

15:52.907 --> 15:54.692
Anybody remember the date ?

15:54.903 --> 15:57.038
End of last month, wasn't it ?

15:57.343 --> 15:58.728
It was the 25th.

15:59.914 --> 16:00.841
You sure ?

16:01.229 --> 16:04.972
Yeah. I remember when i got back to
the dorm, it was all over the news.

16:07.503 --> 16:08.976
Jordan Collier's murder.

16:31.778 --> 16:32.612
Baldwin.

16:32.635 --> 16:34.655
You going to grace us
with a visit tomorrow ?

16:35.653 --> 16:38.213
Yeah, i'm hoping, but right now
it's looking doubtful.

16:38.835 --> 16:40.513
Doubtful doesn't cut it.

16:40.924 --> 16:44.482
We're closing in on this guy. Look,
we've got real leads, and i need you in here.

16:44.822 --> 16:45.891
What kind of leads ?

16:45.914 --> 16:48.029
You want to know ?
You get your ass into work.

16:57.562 --> 16:59.781
Thomas, it could be anyone.

16:59.804 --> 17:02.611
Look closer.
Tell me there isn't a resemblance.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.954
This is insane. Why would Kyle
want to shoot Jordan Collier ?

17:06.002 --> 17:08.808
If it happened during one of the blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.

17:09.031 --> 17:11.931
Not if the future wanted
their number one prophet dead.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.624
So you think they were
controlling him again ?

17:16.659 --> 17:19.523
Yeah, directing his actions,
moving him around like a puppet.

17:19.547 --> 17:21.039
Anything's possible.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.246
Well, in that case,
he wasn't responsible.

17:24.373 --> 17:27.769
The "body snatcher" defense ? Alana,
i'm not sure the jury's going to buy it.

17:28.932 --> 17:31.210
What the hell do
they want from Kyle ?

17:31.386 --> 17:33.781
They took four years of his life.
Isn't that enough ?

17:33.816 --> 17:35.977
They warned us
about this, remember ?

17:36.968 --> 17:39.387
They said you'd be
facing a crisis.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.348
What, and that makes it all right ?

17:41.841 --> 17:43.086
They warned me ?

17:43.285 --> 17:46.559
I don't remember them telling me
they'd turn my son into a murderer.

17:47.005 --> 17:47.932
There must be a reason.

17:47.968 --> 17:51.044
Don't defend them, Alana.
Just don't ! They used me...

17:51.758 --> 17:53.895
All of us... Kyle, Shawn.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.833
I'm fed up.

17:56.678 --> 17:57.887
I love him too.

17:58.275 --> 18:00.763
I know. I know you do,
Alana. Just...

18:06.821 --> 18:09.087
I've got to find him
before ntac does.

18:10.065 --> 18:11.568
I've got to find him.

18:14.691 --> 18:17.509
Stop it.
Serious business.

18:18.130 --> 18:21.288
Your answers are going to determine
how far you would go in the center.

18:21.335 --> 18:24.740
If that security guard comes by,
we'll both get kicked out.

18:24.787 --> 18:25.961
Is that far enough ?

18:26.912 --> 18:29.589
Okay... question number one...

18:30.895 --> 18:32.386
Did you have fun tonight ?

18:32.786 --> 18:34.688
Aren't you glad
we didn't listen to Shawn ?

18:34.723 --> 18:35.662
That's two questions.

18:35.691 --> 18:36.613
- Shh.
- Oh !

18:36.625 --> 18:40.212
You're supposed to think about your
answers, not say them out loud.

18:40.247 --> 18:41.818
- Right.
- Rules are rules.

18:41.865 --> 18:42.758
Okay.

18:46.339 --> 18:47.619
What, are we done ?

18:55.184 --> 18:56.863
Question number two...

18:58.166 --> 19:00.456
Are you ready for
the night to be over ?

19:01.925 --> 19:04.884
If your answer to question
number two is "no,"

19:05.083 --> 19:06.915
Remove your goggles

19:07.314 --> 19:09.111
and take your medicine.

19:16.887 --> 19:18.084
Percocet.

19:19.552 --> 19:20.750
Where'd you get these ?

19:20.773 --> 19:23.471
At the party. Your buddy had
them in the medicine cabinet.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.113
So you stole them ?

19:30.364 --> 19:33.285
What's going on in here ?
This area's closed.

19:42.796 --> 19:44.998
Thanks so much, mrs. Skalka.

20:00.399 --> 20:01.772
I couldn't sleep.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.693
Was that because of me ?

20:07.020 --> 20:09.075
Well, i'm home now, sweetie.

20:10.202 --> 20:11.318
No worries.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.147
You know this case
that i'm working on,

20:17.274 --> 20:20.703
Can you tell me anything else
about what you saw ?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.075
Anything at all ?

20:24.460 --> 20:27.478
Because if you're keeping
something from me...

20:29.462 --> 20:31.141
I told you everything.

20:33.055 --> 20:34.558
Don't you believe me ?

20:34.594 --> 20:35.721
Of course i do.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.324
Are you going to work tomorrow ?

20:40.617 --> 20:42.461
Well, honey, it's my job.

20:45.343 --> 20:46.905
Can i go to sleep now ?

20:49.417 --> 20:50.192
Sure.

20:50.944 --> 20:51.684
Here.

21:05.956 --> 21:06.707
Linda.

21:07.306 --> 21:08.515
Have you heard from Kyle ?

21:08.551 --> 21:12.273
No. I would've called you if i had.
I was hoping you'd heard something.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.151
Linda, you two talk all the time.

21:14.181 --> 21:16.482
Yeah, i don't remember any law
against it in the divorce settlement.

21:16.506 --> 21:19.194
Listen, Linda, if you have
any idea where he is...

21:19.230 --> 21:21.496
What, you think i'm holding
something back ?

21:21.531 --> 21:23.046
You're the one with all the secrets.

21:23.093 --> 21:25.517
Look, you're his mother. It makes
sense you'd try to protect him.

21:25.553 --> 21:27.067
In any way i could.

21:27.103 --> 21:29.474
But i thought that's why he was
living with you, wasn't it ?

21:29.510 --> 21:31.177
Protecting him was
supposed to be your specialty.

21:31.201 --> 21:34.225
You want to blame me ? Fine.
Go ahead, but i've got to find Kyle now.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.074
What if he doesn't want
you to find him ?

21:39.570 --> 21:41.167
I think he may be in trouble.

21:41.402 --> 21:42.717
Serious trouble.

21:45.089 --> 21:46.275
Tom, what is it ?

21:47.026 --> 21:48.388
What did he do ?

21:51.401 --> 21:53.080
At least give me a hint.

21:53.761 --> 21:55.088
You don't want to know.

21:57.847 --> 21:59.291
It's like i said...

22:00.242 --> 22:02.385
You're the one
with all the secrets.

22:18.097 --> 22:18.883
Hello ?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.678
Kyle, i just spoke to your father.

22:22.034 --> 22:23.561
You didn't tell him where i was.

22:23.584 --> 22:27.283
You came to me because you didn't want to
go back to NTAC. That's what you said.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.690
Mom, i can't talk to you
about this. I told you.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.592
Well, that's not the whole story, is it ?

22:32.801 --> 22:33.889
Mom, please.

22:33.924 --> 22:36.367
Kyle, tell me what's going on.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.027
Could you excuse me
for a moment ?

23:52.051 --> 23:53.331
- Sure.
- Thank you.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.952
Just don't tell me
"i told you so."

24:04.633 --> 24:06.441
Okay, i won't, but i did.

24:09.060 --> 24:12.364
Don't go blaming Danny for any of this.
It was all me, okay ?

24:13.468 --> 24:16.180
The night just got away from me.
I had some beers, and i...

24:16.204 --> 24:19.773
You shouldn't be having beers, Liv.
You shouldn't be having anything.

24:19.832 --> 24:21.643
A month ago, you were an addict.

24:22.723 --> 24:25.553
We can quit the lecture.
I've already packed my bags.

24:25.905 --> 24:28.383
You know, you want to quit,
i can't stop you.

24:29.979 --> 24:31.565
But if you want to stay...

24:31.610 --> 24:35.532
and you can promise me that nothing like this
is ever going to happen again, then please,

24:35.567 --> 24:37.293
enjoy life as a first key.

24:38.925 --> 24:40.240
I'm a second key.

24:40.827 --> 24:41.826
Not anymore.

24:43.611 --> 24:46.746
Mr. Farrell ? Are you going
to be much longer ?

24:47.755 --> 24:48.800
No.
Come in.

24:51.348 --> 24:52.159
So i've...

24:52.849 --> 24:55.009
i've got a bunch o
new songs i've written.

24:55.772 --> 24:57.780
Maybe i can play them
for you sometime.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.001
Yeah. We'll see.

25:16.185 --> 25:19.262
It's not like i know him better
than you, but we do talk.

25:19.473 --> 25:21.669
And he told you where his
secret hiding place was ?

25:21.704 --> 25:24.410
No, but you looked
in all the obvious places,

25:24.682 --> 25:26.606
And Kyle likes his privacy.

25:26.888 --> 25:29.083
Maybe you do know him
better than i do.

25:59.664 --> 26:00.333
No...

26:01.965 --> 26:04.043
I didn't want to believe it, i kept...

26:04.472 --> 26:06.562
I kept hoping i was wrong
about this.

26:06.585 --> 26:10.105
Thomas, this is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold on to that.

26:10.704 --> 26:11.385
okay...

26:14.931 --> 26:16.232
Wait, don't turn around.

26:46.651 --> 26:47.448
Alana,

26:47.777 --> 26:49.538
take this, hide it in the house.

26:49.574 --> 26:50.865
What are you going to do ?

26:51.264 --> 26:52.615
Go back to work.

27:01.589 --> 27:03.479
All right, i want
this area secured.

27:03.667 --> 27:06.591
Garrity, i want a warrant to have these
lockers opened and searched, a. S. A. P.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.397
Well...

27:10.007 --> 27:11.968
Look who came out of retirement.

27:12.015 --> 27:14.628
Good timing, Baldwin.
Your partner can bring you up to speed.

27:14.851 --> 27:17.270
That is, assuming
you intend to stick around.

27:17.305 --> 27:18.761
- I'm here.
- Mm-Hmm.

27:19.747 --> 27:23.126
Well, we do know that two days
before the assassination,

27:23.150 --> 27:26.062
Our man arrived at this station
with a bag full of firearms.

27:26.109 --> 27:27.670
Well, he could've gone
anywhere from here.

27:27.694 --> 27:29.699
Yes, so we're canvassing
all the metro routes,

27:29.735 --> 27:32.835
We're talking to the baggage handlers,
ticket agents, bus drivers...

27:32.870 --> 27:33.716
That sounds right.

27:33.751 --> 27:35.606
Meantime, we just had
a shoeshine guy

27:35.641 --> 27:39.868
I. D. The sketch. He claims he helped
our man make change to buy a locker.

27:40.195 --> 27:41.441
Does he recall which locker ?

27:41.463 --> 27:43.013
He thinks it's in that
group there.

27:43.154 --> 27:46.136
but all the people who use
these lockers in a month...

27:46.289 --> 27:49.653
The odds are, like, 1 in, what, 10,000
we'll turn up anything useful.

27:49.689 --> 27:51.462
Yeah, so why are
we even bothering ?

27:51.755 --> 27:53.892
You never know.
All we need is one print.

27:54.244 --> 27:55.747
Yeah. We can only hope.

27:55.771 --> 27:56.757
I guess.

27:58.626 --> 27:59.600
You okay ?

28:02.559 --> 28:04.367
Maia had another vision.

28:05.319 --> 28:07.561
Now, she says if
we catch this guy,

28:07.796 --> 28:09.327
Someone's going to get hurt.

28:11.687 --> 28:12.826
Did she say who ?

28:17.205 --> 28:18.342
Welcome back.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.431
Is Tom here ?

28:29.560 --> 28:31.039
Uh, no, he isn't.

28:32.965 --> 28:34.444
You must be Alana.

28:35.771 --> 28:36.781
I'm Linda.

28:37.894 --> 28:38.774
I know.

28:45.913 --> 28:47.087
That my interview ?

28:48.294 --> 28:50.525
I don't want to see it.
I know i sucked.

28:51.042 --> 28:53.038
I wouldn't go
so far as "sucked."

28:53.672 --> 28:55.727
But you could do
with more eye contact,

28:55.762 --> 28:57.245
Better enunciation.

28:57.374 --> 29:00.509
But they didn't drag any unnecessary
dirt out of you, and that's something.

29:00.544 --> 29:04.419
I was all distracted. Liv was here right
before, and we got into this thing...

29:04.442 --> 29:06.932
Because you told that junkie
not to go out with your brother.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.116
Ex-junkie.

29:08.786 --> 29:11.193
I'm just trying to protect
her, that's all.

29:11.345 --> 29:13.142
I'm sure that was part of it.

29:14.339 --> 29:16.523
What do you think, i'm jealous of Danny ?

29:16.969 --> 29:20.693
You do realize that a relationship
with this girl is out of the question.

29:20.716 --> 29:21.667
Matthew,

29:21.879 --> 29:24.063
advise me all you want
about the center...

29:26.012 --> 29:27.562
But that's where it stops.

29:28.031 --> 29:29.898
You don't understand, Shawn.

29:30.321 --> 29:32.011
You are the center.

29:32.352 --> 29:34.782
Everything about you,
everything you do.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.248
You cannot afford to have
an inappropriate relationship.

29:37.285 --> 29:40.549
Jordan Collier was all about
inappropriate relationships.

29:40.761 --> 29:44.495
I mean, every girl in this place
was fair game to him.

29:44.519 --> 29:47.279
All the more reason
not to repeat his mistakes.

29:49.392 --> 29:52.926
So what girl is worthy
of the great Shawn Farrell ?

29:53.690 --> 29:55.722
I will let you know
when you meet her.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.340
On to more important things...

29:59.796 --> 30:02.250
I wish i had time
to wipe that locker clean.

30:02.638 --> 30:04.645
Kyle's prints could be all over it.

30:06.090 --> 30:08.372
We've got to find him,
get him out of town.

30:08.419 --> 30:09.734
Out of the country.

30:09.769 --> 30:12.728
You didn't get anything else out of Linda ?
Something she wouldn't tell me ?

30:12.751 --> 30:14.724
No, she's as scared as we are.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.107
I felt guilty lying to her.

30:17.154 --> 30:19.784
The less people who know
the truth, the better.

30:19.807 --> 30:23.753
Still, i know how hopeless she feels.
Her son is missing. She needs answers,

30:23.776 --> 30:27.580
And all she has to go on
is a three-line goodbye note.

30:29.096 --> 30:30.505
Did you tell her about the note ?

30:31.996 --> 30:32.712
No.

30:33.663 --> 30:35.495
She brought it up herself.

30:37.385 --> 30:39.062
I never mentioned it to her.

32:39.879 --> 32:40.631
Kyle...

32:47.334 --> 32:48.109
Dad.

32:59.817 --> 33:01.695
No, Kyle, wait !
Wait !

33:02.294 --> 33:03.234
Goddammit,

33:03.374 --> 33:04.941
- Stop it !
- Let go of me !

33:05.450 --> 33:06.507
Enough !

33:07.646 --> 33:08.574
Enough, Kyle.

33:24.963 --> 33:28.321
Then i have been up on that roof, watching
Collier through the scope, the way the

33:28.364 --> 33:30.444
trigger felt
when i pulled it,

33:30.503 --> 33:32.288
And how his body

33:32.981 --> 33:35.952
twisted before it hit the ground...
I mean, i remember all of it,

33:35.975 --> 33:38.429
But it just feels like
somebody else's memories.

33:38.441 --> 33:39.389
They are.

33:40.454 --> 33:42.756
You weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.

33:43.442 --> 33:46.061
You did not kill Jordan Collier.

33:47.376 --> 33:50.276
I haven't had another blackout since.
You think it's over ?

33:51.685 --> 33:52.859
Let's hope so.

33:53.641 --> 33:56.130
How long do you think
i'll be put away for ?

33:57.997 --> 34:01.942
Kyle, i am not going to let them put you
in prison for something you did not do.

34:03.163 --> 34:04.628
- Do you hear me ?
- Yeah.

34:06.354 --> 34:08.574
I just only wish
you would have

34:09.149 --> 34:12.025
told me about these blackouts
when they first started.

34:15.518 --> 34:17.291
You tried.
I didn't listen.

34:22.985 --> 34:23.842
You know...

34:25.047 --> 34:27.244
It's not a new thing, dad.

34:32.610 --> 34:36.237
I... I know i haven't always
been there for you, Kyle, but i

34:37.516 --> 34:39.735
i thought we had
a pretty good relationship.

34:39.772 --> 34:41.099
We do. It's just,

34:41.509 --> 34:46.797
you know, growing up with a dad who works for
the FBI, NTAC... It can be pretty intense, you know ?

34:50.109 --> 34:51.659
You mean i can be
pretty intense.

34:51.694 --> 34:53.690
You can be scary at times.

34:55.507 --> 34:56.893
If you don't believe me, ask mom.

34:56.917 --> 34:58.608
I don't have to.
I believe you.

35:08.586 --> 35:09.925
I'm sorry, dad.

35:11.733 --> 35:12.790
Me too.

35:32.835 --> 35:33.891
Hey, baby.

35:35.723 --> 35:36.897
- Kyle.
- Hi.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.834
I packed a few things for you.
Anything else you need, we'll get in brussels.

35:41.869 --> 35:43.019
What time is the flight ?

35:43.055 --> 35:43.794
Noon.

35:43.888 --> 35:47.000
All right, we'd better check in at
the airport. We'll be safer there.

35:47.153 --> 35:50.265
Okay, i emailed my friend,
and they'll meet us when we land.

35:50.406 --> 35:52.425
They promised
to take good care of Kyle.

35:52.883 --> 35:54.386
Say goodbye to mom for me, okay ?

35:54.422 --> 35:55.349
- Sure.
- Yeah

35:55.408 --> 35:57.698
I promise to break
the news to her gently.

35:58.026 --> 36:01.570
- I'll come and visit you as soon as i can, Kyle.
- That'd be good.

36:01.605 --> 36:02.333
Okay.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.834
- I love you.
- I love you.

36:11.746 --> 36:12.614
All right.

36:12.885 --> 36:14.235
- Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.

36:16.454 --> 36:17.252
Alana...

36:19.256 --> 36:21.018
Keep a close eye on him, okay ?

36:21.699 --> 36:23.918
I will, Thomas.
I will.

37:12.288 --> 37:16.069
So far, we've found two ounces of hash,
some bootleg dvds,

37:16.104 --> 37:19.850
and three dop kits that belong to people
who shower in the terminal bathrooms.

37:20.214 --> 37:25.770
I'm hoping we find a picture of Collier with a big fat "X"
marked through it, all covered in usable prints.

37:25.969 --> 37:26.791
Yeah.

37:34.225 --> 37:35.963
Is everything okay at home ?

37:36.385 --> 37:38.781
Because if you need to take care
of business, now is a good time.

37:38.804 --> 37:41.376
I can hang with Forensics
i case something turns up.

37:41.411 --> 37:42.747
Thanks. I'll, uh...

37:43.640 --> 37:44.931
I'll stick around here.

37:48.254 --> 37:49.111
Skouris.

37:50.955 --> 37:52.268
When did that happen ?

37:53.383 --> 37:54.933
No. We'll be right there.

37:55.168 --> 37:57.469
That was Jarvis.
She just got a call from metro west.

37:57.490 --> 38:00.766
They arrested a suspect 40 minutes ago,
claim he's our guy.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.118
Roy Keith Marsden.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.536
25, unemployed,

38:44.382 --> 38:47.634
Made threats against Collier
after his uncle joined the 4400 center.

38:47.752 --> 38:48.985
Oh, and get this...

38:49.102 --> 38:51.591
He owned a .50-caliber JHLP-6.

39:32.415 --> 39:33.178
Alana ?

39:33.225 --> 39:35.379
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

39:35.548 --> 39:37.908
They just arrested a suspect
in the Collier killing.

39:53.063 --> 39:55.858
You know, if you're here to give me
grief about Liv, you can forget it.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.758
What happened was
your screw-up, not mine.

39:59.709 --> 40:00.508
You know,

40:00.778 --> 40:02.280
you could've pulled me aside,

40:02.762 --> 40:05.456
Told me she had this drug problem.
I would've backed off.

40:06.066 --> 40:06.947
So

40:07.017 --> 40:10.998
if you're expecting me to apologize
and kiss your robe, you're wasting your time.

40:11.092 --> 40:12.841
I didn't come here for that.

40:16.270 --> 40:18.759
Look, i just don't want
this to become a big thing.

40:18.947 --> 40:21.859
Ok, when we were kids
we used to fight like crazy.

40:23.366 --> 40:24.874
Yeah. All the time.

40:25.649 --> 40:29.747
Yeah, and then the next day, we'd blow it off.
Everything would go back to normal.

40:30.985 --> 40:32.659
Yeah.
Simple as that.

40:33.940 --> 40:35.454
Nothing wrong with simple.

40:40.386 --> 40:43.838
Are you, uh, planning on standing there,
or are you going to help me out here ?

40:44.105 --> 40:45.303
With the car ?

40:46.149 --> 40:49.307
I don't wash cars anymore.
I've got people that do that for me.

40:49.342 --> 40:50.223
- Oh, yeah ?
- Yeah.

40:50.246 --> 40:52.392
Yeah, well, i don't, so...
Grab a sponge.

40:52.428 --> 40:53.743
Oh, see, now...

40:56.009 --> 40:57.617
I should've known
i was going to get wet.

40:57.653 --> 40:59.907
Yeah, attaboy.
Get your hands dirty.

41:00.306 --> 41:01.614
It's been a while, huh ?

41:45.061 --> 41:45.942
Come on.

41:53.598 --> 41:54.842
Hey, sweetie.

41:54.875 --> 41:55.697
Hi.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.912
Look, i know you've
already had dinner,

41:57.955 --> 42:00.441
But what do you say we take
another crack at those brownies ?

42:00.488 --> 42:01.345
Okay.

42:01.714 --> 42:02.583
Great.

42:03.147 --> 42:04.380
So how was your day ?

42:04.415 --> 42:05.469
Pretty good.

42:05.857 --> 42:06.702
Good.

42:07.618 --> 42:09.509
Aren't you going
to ask me about mine ?

42:09.696 --> 42:13.043
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for, and guess what.

42:13.407 --> 42:14.910
Nobody was hurt.

42:15.258 --> 42:17.454
So there's nothing to worry about.

42:18.287 --> 42:19.967
It's all over.

42:23.289 --> 42:24.299
Not yet.
