<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.259
Where is she?!

00:04.488 --> 00:06.573
Whenever you
asked about the hybrid,

00:06.596 --> 00:07.873
it feared the west.

00:07.897 --> 00:09.147
That's where she is.

00:09.171 --> 00:10.732
There is no war here.

00:11.003 --> 00:14.906
Her DNA's a mutation --
part human, part alien.

00:15.426 --> 00:17.659
I don't want these powers.
They're getting stronger.

00:17.831 --> 00:18.503
The green barrier.

00:18.527 --> 00:20.422
To go over it,
you need one of these.

00:21.047 --> 00:23.647
We are creating a new,
frontline army.

00:23.671 --> 00:25.370
You and your family
can be spared

00:25.394 --> 00:26.713
from the great transformation..

00:26.898 --> 00:28.083
I made a deal.

00:28.107 --> 00:30.144
We're getting out of here --
all the way out.

are right on time.

00:53.923 --> 00:57.760
Come on, guys.
Just a little bit further.

01:22.218 --> 01:24.620
Come on, guys. The wall's
supposed to be down by now.

01:32.729 --> 01:33.996

01:48.912 --> 01:51.713
My favorite Zeppelin?
"Led Zeppelin II."

01:51.748 --> 01:54.082
"Lemon Song" alone is enough
to earn the title.

01:54.117 --> 01:56.218
"II," huh?
What about "IV"?

01:56.252 --> 01:58.754
You got "Black Dog,"
"Stairway To Heaven,"

01:58.788 --> 01:59.988
I mean, come on.

02:00.056 --> 02:01.356
When did you become
a Zeppelin fan?

02:01.391 --> 02:03.892
The second I heard it.

02:03.927 --> 02:05.627
I can tell you what my
least favorite Zeppelin is.

02:05.695 --> 02:07.029
Let me guess.

02:07.063 --> 02:08.864
It's that...giant alien one
flying around,

02:08.898 --> 02:10.899
monitoring
all activity in camp.

02:10.934 --> 02:12.901
Actually, it's "CODA."

02:12.936 --> 02:16.238
"CODA's" pretty bad.

02:18.408 --> 02:22.411
What was it like
up there?

02:22.445 --> 02:23.712
Scary.

02:23.746 --> 02:25.380
I learned a few things,
though.

02:25.448 --> 02:27.282
They're gonna be
taking us out of here

02:27.317 --> 02:28.984
with plans
to skitterize us all.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.986
That's happening
in 48 hours.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.322
That Zeppelin is
the command and control center

02:33.356 --> 02:34.823
for the whole perimeter.

02:34.858 --> 02:37.359
And that tether --
we cut that tether,

02:37.393 --> 02:40.095
we cut the power
to the walls.

02:40.129 --> 02:41.396
You say that
like it's pretty easy.

02:41.431 --> 02:42.664
That's a tall order.

02:42.699 --> 02:45.000
I know.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.870
There's a lot
that could go wrong.

02:47.937 --> 02:49.872
I tell you one thing I'm not
worried about, though --

02:49.939 --> 02:51.273
it's you.

02:51.307 --> 02:53.242
You're gonna do great.

02:56.813 --> 02:58.780
When we get out
of here --

02:58.815 --> 03:01.116
we're gonna
take the fight to them.

03:07.891 --> 03:09.992
A Faraday suit works

03:10.059 --> 03:11.727
because the current
from the fence

03:11.761 --> 03:14.696
distributes charges
onto the suit in such a way

03:14.731 --> 03:18.033
that they cancel the current's
effects inside the suit.

03:18.101 --> 03:20.369
Okay. I get that.
For how long, though?

03:20.403 --> 03:22.371
Uh, 90 seconds or so.

03:22.405 --> 03:24.072
Or until what little copper
solder we have fails.

03:24.140 --> 03:25.474
So, what do you do,
exactly?

03:25.508 --> 03:26.975
You just put on the suit
and walk through the wall?

03:27.043 --> 03:28.877
No.

03:28.912 --> 03:31.179
The wall's electrical current
is concentrated at the center.

03:31.247 --> 03:32.848
Yeah.

03:32.916 --> 03:35.017
The suit can only withstand
superficial contact.

03:35.084 --> 03:38.053
That's why I have to climb
one of those giant sticks,

03:38.087 --> 03:41.189
go right over the top,
and climb down.

03:41.224 --> 03:43.058
Aren't the obelisks
electrified, too?

03:43.126 --> 03:45.761
No. Well, yes.

03:45.795 --> 03:49.431
But not at the voltage levels
in the center of the wall.

03:49.465 --> 03:53.135
The suit can take it.
I know. I've done it.

03:53.202 --> 03:55.837
Uh...

03:55.872 --> 03:59.107
What kind of charges am I using
to blow the tether?

03:59.142 --> 04:01.443
Ammonium nitrate.

04:01.477 --> 04:04.947
Ammonium nitrate?

04:04.981 --> 04:07.849
You realize the volatility
of ammonium nitrate?

04:07.884 --> 04:10.052
This suit isn't strong enough --
It's all we have.

04:10.086 --> 04:14.089
This is a situation where every
single thing must go right.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.257
We don't have a choice.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.793
Don't worry.

04:18.827 --> 04:21.430
We can do this.

04:21.464 --> 04:23.966
You are not the one wearing
a homemade trash can

04:24.000 --> 04:26.935
for protection,
my friend.

04:27.003 --> 04:30.305
You found Lexi in the woods
meeting with an Espheni.

04:30.340 --> 04:32.174
Are you sure?

04:32.208 --> 04:34.042
I'm sure.

04:34.077 --> 04:36.211
God, she's been telling us
to lay down our weapons.

04:36.245 --> 04:39.181
This whole time, she's been
meeting with the enemy.

04:39.248 --> 04:40.916
What do you think
it means?

04:40.950 --> 04:43.185
Is she conspiring?
I don't know.

04:43.219 --> 04:46.922
On one hand, you've been safe
here like she said you would be.

04:46.956 --> 04:48.423
And on the other hand,

04:48.458 --> 04:50.959
she could be setting us up
for something.

04:50.994 --> 04:53.962
You were right.

04:53.997 --> 04:55.530
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

04:55.565 --> 04:58.367
Um, we can't just go off
half-cocked, you know?

04:58.434 --> 05:00.902
It's -- it's different here.
I can see that.

05:00.937 --> 05:03.939
Let's just take a beat...

05:03.973 --> 05:06.041
I thought
you threw those away.

05:06.109 --> 05:07.943
I was going to.

05:07.977 --> 05:10.145
I almost did when she stopped
that mech, but...

05:10.179 --> 05:13.882
I guess I thought I needed to
hang on to them, just in case.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.851
In case of what?

05:15.885 --> 05:18.186
In case all this sanctuary here

05:18.221 --> 05:20.055
turned out
too good to be true.

05:22.291 --> 05:28.096
I got to say, you look more
like yourself with those.

05:28.131 --> 05:31.233
She lied to me, Ben,

05:31.267 --> 05:33.201
she lied to all of us,
and I bought it.

05:33.236 --> 05:35.037
I don't like
being betrayed.

05:35.071 --> 05:36.905
Let's just talk
to her first.

05:36.939 --> 05:38.540
If she's meeting
with the enemy

05:38.574 --> 05:41.843
and she's not telling us about
it, she's just gonna lie.

05:41.878 --> 05:44.880
I'm not even sure
she's capable of lying.

05:44.914 --> 05:46.948
Let's just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

05:46.983 --> 05:49.618
She's earned that.

05:49.652 --> 05:52.287
She's still my sister,
Maggie.

05:52.355 --> 05:55.157
Okay.

05:55.191 --> 05:56.958
But I'm bringing my guns.

06:02.498 --> 06:05.167
Today is a very special day.

06:05.201 --> 06:07.002
One of our graduates
has come back

06:07.036 --> 06:09.237
having done some exemplary work
in the field.

06:09.272 --> 06:12.107
I am sure you will all
remember Sheila!

06:14.911 --> 06:18.547
Sheila has rescued several
holdouts who were in bad shape.

06:18.581 --> 06:21.883
They will be fed, clothed,
seen to, and transferred

06:21.918 --> 06:24.052
to one of our
transitional facilities.

06:25.922 --> 06:28.557
She was also
able to find some folks

06:28.591 --> 06:31.226
that are very special to her,
personally.

06:31.294 --> 06:33.562
Sheila, would you like
to introduce our guests?

06:33.596 --> 06:37.265
This is Bill and Martha,
my parents.

06:40.503 --> 06:44.339
Now, Bill, tell the students
what life was like out there

06:44.373 --> 06:47.042
before your daughter
rescued you.

06:47.076 --> 06:50.378
We were starving, sick.

06:50.413 --> 06:57.285
But thanks to Sheila, I realized
how wrong it was to resist.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.988
She helped me to see
how important it is

07:00.022 --> 07:03.158
that we accept
the new paradigm,

07:03.192 --> 07:06.995
join hands with the Espheni
to forge a better world.

07:07.029 --> 07:10.165
Bill and Martha are going to be
escorted to an adult camp

07:10.233 --> 07:15.470
to learn more about their
opportunities in the new world.

07:15.538 --> 07:17.672
Sheila,
how could you do this?

07:17.740 --> 07:21.977
You betrayed us!
You betrayed everyone!

07:22.011 --> 07:24.579
Sheila!

07:24.614 --> 07:26.948
Don't worry, Sheila.

07:26.983 --> 07:29.484
Your mom will understand
in time,

07:29.519 --> 07:33.488
and thank you for your integrity
and commitment to duty.

07:33.523 --> 07:36.458
You've made the camp and me
very proud.

07:41.230 --> 07:46.067
And I know all of you out there
will do the same.

07:50.373 --> 07:53.975
This is the key to understanding
the triskelion.

07:54.010 --> 07:57.479
One entity can merge
with another

07:57.513 --> 08:01.183
to make a whole greater
than the sum of its parts.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.517
We need to talk to Lexi.

08:02.552 --> 08:04.386
Not now. She's in the middle
of a teaching.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.721
I don't care what she's doing.
We need to talk to her alone.

08:06.756 --> 08:08.123
Now.

08:08.191 --> 08:11.493
We can talk now --
here, with everyone.

08:11.527 --> 08:14.196
Last night,
I followed you into the woods.

08:14.230 --> 08:16.298
I saw who you were
meeting with.

08:16.332 --> 08:17.732
Yes?

08:17.767 --> 08:19.634
An Espheni.

08:19.702 --> 08:22.304
Don't question Lexi
like this, Ben.

08:22.338 --> 08:25.240
Shut up, Lourdes. Please drop
the high-priestess routine.

08:25.274 --> 08:26.541
You're not fooling anyone.

08:26.576 --> 08:28.410
Yes.

08:28.477 --> 08:31.780
I talked to an Espheni,
just like I talk to all of you.

08:31.814 --> 08:34.515
I'm the bridge
between the species.

08:34.549 --> 08:37.652
I trusted you, Lexi.
We all did.

08:37.687 --> 08:41.022
And now we find out
you're meeting with the enemy?

08:41.090 --> 08:43.191
I know you're angry.

08:43.226 --> 08:45.527
But you're putting
this place in danger.

08:45.561 --> 08:47.529
You shouldn't have
brought them.

08:47.563 --> 08:50.265
You made a promise,
Maggie.

09:02.111 --> 09:03.445
What are you doing?!

09:03.479 --> 09:04.746
Lexi!

09:04.780 --> 09:07.649
Lexi, did you --

09:07.683 --> 09:09.684
Did you break her wrist?

09:09.719 --> 09:11.620
She'll be all right.

09:14.824 --> 09:18.059
I didn't
throw them away

09:18.094 --> 09:20.061
because I had a sneaking
suspicion there was a reason

09:20.096 --> 09:22.063
you didn't want us
to get rid of them.

09:22.098 --> 09:23.565
So we'd be easier
to kill.

09:23.599 --> 09:25.567
Put your gun down,
Maggie, now!

09:25.601 --> 09:29.271
Everyone, calm down?! Maggie!
You lied to me, Lexi.

09:29.338 --> 09:31.606
When did I lie to you,
Maggie?

09:31.641 --> 09:34.342
I told you we'd be safe here,
and we are.

09:34.377 --> 09:38.146
I told you that non-violence
is the answer, and it is.

09:39.849 --> 09:43.351
Why are you meeting with
an Espheni behind our backs?

09:43.419 --> 09:45.520
Because...

09:45.554 --> 09:48.390
He's a part of me.

09:50.493 --> 09:52.394
It's who I am.

09:56.132 --> 09:57.732
What do they really want?

09:57.767 --> 10:00.769
The same thing I do,

10:00.803 --> 10:03.405
the same thing
we all do --

10:03.439 --> 10:04.706
peace.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.460
You expect me to believe that?

10:08.844 --> 10:11.646
Lexi, what are you doing?
I can tell you this --

10:11.681 --> 10:13.815
if you raise
your guns again,

10:13.849 --> 10:17.852
this place will no longer
be safe...for any of you.

10:17.887 --> 10:22.824
If you don't believe me,
shoot.

10:39.187 --> 10:41.154
You see how narrow that is?

10:41.189 --> 10:43.323
It's not gonna take
a big charge to sever it.

10:43.357 --> 10:45.358
Assuming that nitrate

10:45.393 --> 10:47.894
doesn't explode
before you get there.

10:47.929 --> 10:49.896
That metal coil
attached to the zeppelin

10:49.931 --> 10:51.898
powers
the entire camp's grid.

10:51.933 --> 10:53.166
You take out that tether,

10:53.201 --> 10:55.001
I promise you
the walls are gonna come down.

11:01.943 --> 11:04.377
What about those skitters
guarding the camp?

11:04.412 --> 11:06.746
Draw them off
with a distraction.

11:06.781 --> 11:08.915
What distraction?

11:08.950 --> 11:10.150
Me.

11:12.887 --> 11:14.621
What kind of distraction
will you be?

11:14.655 --> 11:16.223
The kind
that baits an overlord

11:16.257 --> 11:18.058
into overreacting
into an ambush.

11:18.092 --> 11:21.194
It's basically the same strategy
that Geronimo used

11:21.229 --> 11:23.797
against the Mexican army
in Guadalupe.

11:23.865 --> 11:27.033
The legend is it was
the feast of Saint Jerome.

11:27.068 --> 11:29.102
A local bishop
and all the army brass

11:29.170 --> 11:31.238
are gathered together
in celebration,

11:31.272 --> 11:33.073
all decked out
in their finery.

11:33.107 --> 11:36.743
Out of the desert comes
this lone apache brave,

11:36.777 --> 11:40.881
unarmed, wearing a cotton shirt,
breechcloth, moccasins.

11:40.915 --> 11:42.749
Having already had
a bit to drink,

11:42.783 --> 11:44.818
the Mexican soldiers
start to taunt him,

11:44.886 --> 11:46.353
point at him,
laugh at him.

11:46.387 --> 11:52.058
From inside his shirt,
the brave pulls out a small bow,

11:52.093 --> 11:55.729
shoots the bishop
through the neck, and walks --

11:55.763 --> 11:59.232
not runs,
walks back into the desert.

11:59.267 --> 12:01.067
The Mexican army
jump on horseback

12:01.135 --> 12:06.106
and give chase right into an
ambush in a bottleneck canyon.

12:06.140 --> 12:10.777
The priests,
women standing on the parapets

12:10.845 --> 12:13.113
could only watch
as the entire Mexican army

12:13.147 --> 12:17.284
is annihilated
in this Apache crossfire.

12:17.318 --> 12:19.052
When it's all over,

12:19.086 --> 12:22.756
the brave stands on a rock
above the dying soldiers,

12:22.790 --> 12:25.458
and he listens to them
beg for mercy,

12:25.493 --> 12:29.296
pray to Saint Jerome,
San Geronimo, for deliverance.

12:29.330 --> 12:32.799
That's how Geronimo
got his name.

12:32.833 --> 12:36.136
That's how he got
his revenge.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.338
That's
what we're gonna do.

12:38.372 --> 12:41.308
We're gonna bait them
into an ambush.

12:41.375 --> 12:45.045
What if history
doesn't repeat itself?

12:45.079 --> 12:47.280
What if they don't respond
as you're predicting

12:47.315 --> 12:49.716
and I die doing something
I didn't have to do?

12:49.784 --> 12:51.885
We're all going to die.

12:51.953 --> 12:53.420
None of us
have to do a thing.

12:53.454 --> 12:56.957
Can't save everyone.
I have to think of myself.

12:56.991 --> 12:59.292
We have to
save everyone.

12:59.327 --> 13:01.161
Look, let's say you put on
your Faraday suit

13:01.195 --> 13:03.330
and you escape alone --
to what?

13:03.364 --> 13:04.965
To go and live in a cave

13:04.999 --> 13:06.833
until they find you and drag you
back to another camp?

13:06.867 --> 13:09.803
I'll stay here,
hole up till something --

13:09.870 --> 13:12.138
Everyone left behind
is gonna be skitterized

13:12.173 --> 13:15.408
by the Espheni
in a matter of days.

13:15.443 --> 13:17.777
90 seconds, Tom.

13:17.812 --> 13:21.781
That's how long
the suit will last.

13:21.816 --> 13:24.250
That's how long we have
to climb the fence,

13:24.318 --> 13:26.419
assuming the bomb doesn't
spontaneously combust,

13:26.454 --> 13:29.322
then we still have to get to
the tether, set the explosive,

13:29.357 --> 13:31.291
and hope the charge
is strong enough

13:31.325 --> 13:33.994
to actually cut it.

13:36.497 --> 13:39.866
You've already lost everyone
you've ever cared about.

13:41.402 --> 13:43.203
The only thing
that's kept me going

13:43.237 --> 13:46.373
these last three
years has been the 2nd Mass --

13:46.440 --> 13:48.308
my new family.

13:48.342 --> 13:53.513
I want you
to be a part of it.

13:53.581 --> 13:57.250
Without family,
life's not much worth living.

14:20.975 --> 14:25.078
Oh. No, thanks.
Save it.

14:25.112 --> 14:27.447
It's quiet.

14:27.481 --> 14:29.282
It's too quiet.

14:29.316 --> 14:30.850
That's what people
in movies

14:30.885 --> 14:33.486
always say
before the bad guys attack.

14:33.521 --> 14:36.222
That's why I said it.

14:36.257 --> 14:38.558
Good to get this waiting
over with.

14:38.592 --> 14:42.062
We have to just keep
heading to the west.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.365
The skitter
told Denny Lexi is to the west.

14:45.399 --> 14:47.233
Anne,
are you okay?

14:47.301 --> 14:49.936
I'm...I'm fine.

14:52.339 --> 14:54.474
Hey. Turn over.

14:56.343 --> 14:57.944
When was the last time
you had something to eat?

14:57.978 --> 15:00.113
Anne.

15:00.147 --> 15:02.182
I don't --
I don't remember.

15:02.216 --> 15:03.650
You didn't
get any rations?

15:06.387 --> 15:09.055
Anne.

15:09.090 --> 15:11.057
Anne!

15:11.092 --> 15:12.592
Anne!

15:12.626 --> 15:16.596
They're
going to break us.

15:16.630 --> 15:20.200
No. We just
have to stay strong.

15:20.234 --> 15:22.234
They brainwashed a girl
into betraying her parents,

15:22.236 --> 15:24.037
and the other kids
clapped.

15:24.071 --> 15:26.539
I know.

15:26.607 --> 15:28.108
I've seen it before.

15:28.142 --> 15:30.110
Well,
it was my first time.

15:30.144 --> 15:34.280
And I am not sticking around
for another.

15:34.315 --> 15:36.916
What if the next Bill or Martha
is someone we know?

15:36.951 --> 15:40.019
Your family?

15:40.054 --> 15:41.454
What if
we become Sheila?

15:41.489 --> 15:43.423
I'll die
before they turn me.

15:43.457 --> 15:45.358
Maybe you're tougher than me,

15:45.426 --> 15:47.494
but I feel like
the longer I stick around,

15:47.528 --> 15:49.696
the more
they're gonna get to me.

15:49.730 --> 15:52.565
I know how I am.

15:52.600 --> 15:57.403
I have got to get out of here
before they break me.

15:57.438 --> 16:01.374
I was the same way
when I first came here.

16:01.408 --> 16:03.376
But I didn't give in.

16:03.410 --> 16:06.346
The more I told myself to be
strong, the stronger I got.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.548
You're stronger
than you think, Mira.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.055
I saw some wire cutters
in the maintenance shed

16:16.090 --> 16:17.257
during chore detail.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.958
Tell me
you didn't take them.

16:18.993 --> 16:20.960
Mira, they don't miss anything
around here.

16:20.995 --> 16:22.262
Of course not.

16:22.296 --> 16:24.597
I'm just saying...
We could cut the fence --

16:24.632 --> 16:27.033
How far do you think
we're gonna get?

16:27.101 --> 16:29.569
I thought
you wanted to escape.

16:29.603 --> 16:31.304
I do.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.173
But we got to play along
right now.

16:33.207 --> 16:36.242
Okay? Listen.

16:36.277 --> 16:39.045
We graduate from the camp
with honors,

16:39.079 --> 16:42.482
and then they set us free
to go round up terrorists.

16:42.516 --> 16:44.551
But when we're out,
we're gonna warn everyone

16:44.585 --> 16:46.553
about the sick crap
that's going on here.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.637
<i>The earth is a gift.</i>

16:52.671 --> 16:56.474
The new coalition must protect
it with our Espheni brothers.

16:56.508 --> 17:01.212
Joined together,
we will build a beautiful world.

17:20.266 --> 17:22.400
Everybody up! Now!

17:22.434 --> 17:24.068
Get up!

17:24.103 --> 17:27.472
Hurry up! Fall in!

17:35.514 --> 17:39.350
Found it!

17:39.385 --> 17:41.786
Under an empty bed,
sir.

17:46.525 --> 17:49.861
Who took these?

17:52.398 --> 17:54.832
Someone confess
or you all will be punished

17:54.900 --> 17:57.268
for one person's crime.

17:59.638 --> 18:02.140
I'm gonna count to three.

18:05.778 --> 18:07.178
One...

18:08.547 --> 18:09.714
...two...

18:09.748 --> 18:11.883
Those are mine.

18:25.264 --> 18:29.534
I had high hopes
for you, Matt.

18:29.568 --> 18:32.236
I'm very disappointed.

18:32.271 --> 18:35.256
I'm afraid your training
is gonna be much more unpleasant

18:35.290 --> 18:37.225
from here on out.

18:42.829 --> 18:44.363
What you're looking at

18:44.398 --> 18:45.898
is a model of the ghetto
we've been living in

18:45.933 --> 18:49.368
for the past four months,
ever since the walls came down.

18:49.566 --> 18:52.067
Tomorrow, I have a summit
meeting with our overlord

18:52.102 --> 18:56.605
to report on my progress
convincing you all to surrender.

18:59.476 --> 19:01.910
But instead, I'm gonna
initiate a confrontation

19:01.945 --> 19:05.047
that should bait every
skitter sentry in the ghetto

19:05.081 --> 19:06.582
into giving chase.

19:06.649 --> 19:09.651
I'll travel north
along the main street here,

19:09.686 --> 19:12.921
and then turn east
at their main guard tower here.

19:12.956 --> 19:14.523
11-second interval between
skitter-guard shifts --

19:14.557 --> 19:16.024
that's our window.

19:16.059 --> 19:18.727
If I time it just right,
I should be able to draw them

19:18.761 --> 19:22.264
all together here,
at the exact same time.

19:22.298 --> 19:24.032
When they're focused on me,

19:24.067 --> 19:26.201
Dingaan,
wearing his Faraday suit,

19:26.236 --> 19:28.170
is gonna climb over
one of the big posts

19:28.238 --> 19:31.039
that generates
the electrical fence right here

19:31.074 --> 19:32.741
on the opposite side
of the ghetto

19:32.809 --> 19:35.744
at the closest proximity
to the tether.

19:35.778 --> 19:38.213
Colonel Weaver,
Tector provide cover

19:38.281 --> 19:40.916
from the alley
just opposite if he needs it.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.217
Pope, you'll join them.

19:42.252 --> 19:44.686
With what weapons,
there, Chief?

19:44.721 --> 19:46.922
We've pieced together
a pressure Cannon we can rig up.

19:46.956 --> 19:48.557
Should buy Dingaan
a little time.

19:48.591 --> 19:50.592
After Dingaan
makes it over the wall,

19:50.627 --> 19:52.794
he's gonna find his way
to the base of that tether,

19:52.829 --> 19:55.631
and he's gonna set the
explosives that will sever it.

19:55.665 --> 19:57.833
That will bring the wall down,
allowing you, Hal, a chance

19:57.867 --> 20:00.502
to lead the entire population
out through the sewer tunnels

20:00.570 --> 20:01.970
before the Espheni ever
realize that they're gone.

20:02.038 --> 20:03.572
And how
are you gonna get away

20:03.606 --> 20:05.007
with all these skitters
chasing after you?

20:05.041 --> 20:06.742
And you got the reenforcements
from the outside

20:06.809 --> 20:08.143
that are gonna be on your ass
like that.

20:08.178 --> 20:11.847
'Cause I'll be leading them
into a trap --

20:11.915 --> 20:14.750
Here, where colonel Weaver and I
spent two months in solitary

20:14.784 --> 20:16.718
studying every single
nook and cranny.

20:16.753 --> 20:18.587
Structural weaknesses.
Exactly.

20:18.621 --> 20:20.322
This building's gonna be rigged
with explosives.

20:20.356 --> 20:22.024
So, knock on wood,
if everything goes as --

20:23.693 --> 20:26.295
Sorry, uh,
for a minute there,

20:26.362 --> 20:28.263
I thought I was passing by
a graveyard.

20:28.298 --> 20:30.999
Look, if Dingaan
doesn't cut this tether,

20:31.034 --> 20:33.168
you're the one who's trapped.
Dingaan will cut the tether.

20:33.203 --> 20:34.870
I will draw their attention,

20:34.938 --> 20:36.638
and you'll lead everybody out
through the sewer tunnel.

20:36.673 --> 20:38.640
Why intentionally have every skitter
in the vicinity chasing after you?

20:38.675 --> 20:40.108
'Cause if they're
chasing after me,

20:40.143 --> 20:41.810
they won't be
chasing after you.

20:41.878 --> 20:44.313
Well,
I think it's great.

20:44.347 --> 20:46.014
I think
it's a fantastic plan.

20:46.082 --> 20:49.585
It has zero chance of success,
but, uh, what the hell?

20:49.619 --> 20:51.253
And what's
this Faraday suit?

20:51.287 --> 20:52.644
How do we know
this thing's even gonna work?

20:52.668 --> 20:53.322
It will.

20:53.323 --> 20:54.957
Yeah, and how do we know
that Dingaan here's

20:54.991 --> 20:57.292
not just gonna hop the fence
and skedaddle?

20:57.327 --> 21:00.229
He won't.

21:00.263 --> 21:01.763
Why do you -- all of a sudden,
you trust this guy.

21:01.831 --> 21:02.998
You've known dingo here
for what? Five minutes.

21:03.032 --> 21:04.199
I've been with you
since the beginning.

21:04.234 --> 21:05.901
You don't trust me?
No!

21:05.935 --> 21:07.736
I don't trust you
because all you do

21:07.770 --> 21:10.339
is drive people apart like
you're trying to do right now.

21:16.679 --> 21:18.799
The only way that we're gonna
survive this, obviously,

21:18.815 --> 21:20.282
is if we all work together,
regardless of how we may feel

21:20.316 --> 21:21.984
about each other personally.

21:22.018 --> 21:24.853
We have no choice.

21:24.887 --> 21:28.023
In two days, this entire camp
is scheduled for processing,

21:28.057 --> 21:29.258
whatever the hell that means.

21:29.292 --> 21:33.328
Mutation...
Into God knows what.

21:33.363 --> 21:35.163
Humanoid skitters.

21:35.198 --> 21:36.832
According to you.

21:36.899 --> 21:39.601
And I, for one, am not buying
into the scare tactic.

21:39.669 --> 21:41.903
Anybody got any real questions
about this mission?

21:41.938 --> 21:44.106
No? Good. We got a lot of work
to do in the next 24 hours.

21:44.140 --> 21:45.173
Let's get to it.

21:49.445 --> 21:52.914
Oh, now, this is what I call
Hell's Kitchen.

21:52.982 --> 21:58.787
Rock sod, duct tape, baking
soda, acetone, ammonium nitrate.

21:58.855 --> 22:03.058
Let's make some bombs.

22:11.834 --> 22:13.135
Come on.
Hurry. Let's go.

22:13.169 --> 22:16.238
Hurry. Come on.
Let's go.

22:16.272 --> 22:20.042
Come on.

22:22.278 --> 22:24.079
Next group will be along
in 15 minutes.

22:24.113 --> 22:26.248
Take care of each other.
Yeah.

22:26.282 --> 22:28.850
I told you not to make
these groups too big.

22:28.885 --> 22:30.385
If any
of these skitter guards

22:30.453 --> 22:32.187
find out that the entire
population's trying to escape

22:32.221 --> 22:33.689
through the sewer,
the whole thing's over.

22:33.756 --> 22:37.225
15 people at the max,
15 minute intervals.

22:37.260 --> 22:39.061
You got that?
Don't be seen, okay?

22:39.095 --> 22:41.863
Okay.

22:44.934 --> 22:46.668
Here's some more charges.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.270
You got to be careful when
you're handling them, though,

22:48.304 --> 22:49.905
'cause ammonium nitrate
is very --

22:49.939 --> 22:52.808
Unstable.
No juggling. Got it.

22:55.044 --> 22:56.345
Careful with that.

22:56.412 --> 22:58.080
That's the last
of the load-bearing beams.

22:58.114 --> 23:00.248
We don't want this place
to collapse yet.

23:00.283 --> 23:03.051
You forget I was a general
contractor for 10 years.

23:03.086 --> 23:04.886
We got about
12 charges set, man.

23:04.921 --> 23:06.355
That should be more than enough
to pulverize this joint.

23:06.389 --> 23:07.422
Ooh-whee!

23:07.457 --> 23:09.057
Hal,
how goes the exodus?

23:09.092 --> 23:10.726
Well, we moved the first half
of the population

23:10.760 --> 23:13.261
into the tunnels in groups of 15
to avoid detection.

23:13.296 --> 23:15.697
They're snuggled up,
waiting for us for tomorrow.

23:15.732 --> 23:18.066
See that?
He does listen.

23:18.101 --> 23:20.235
Do another sweep, make sure
nobody gets left behind.

23:20.269 --> 23:21.937
Yes, sir.

23:29.979 --> 23:31.947
Why are you awake?

23:31.981 --> 23:34.149
Hard to sleep when
you got rats in your brain.

23:34.183 --> 23:37.285
Oh, well,
maybe this will help.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.287
What?!

23:39.322 --> 23:42.190
Have you been holding out
on me?

23:46.396 --> 23:48.530
To this mission.
The mission.

23:53.936 --> 23:56.438
Yeah. Let's see.

23:56.472 --> 23:59.107
And to your daughter...
On her birthday.

23:59.142 --> 24:02.978
Thanks for remembering.

24:03.012 --> 24:07.149
I can't forget.

24:09.485 --> 24:13.188
I wonder
what Anne's doing.

24:13.222 --> 24:15.056
Probably kicking back
on a beach somewhere,

24:15.091 --> 24:16.558
deep into
her third Mai Tai,

24:16.592 --> 24:19.361
helping the cabana boys
adjust their umbrellas.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.002
Yeah,
that sounds about right.

24:27.036 --> 24:29.004
Is it a fever?

24:29.038 --> 24:31.540
I don't think so.

24:31.574 --> 24:34.876
She's been going
too hard.

24:34.944 --> 24:39.214
Her body finally shut down
without her permission.

24:39.248 --> 24:41.416
It's okay.

24:41.451 --> 24:43.552
Make sure she's warm.

24:51.861 --> 24:57.499
It's a powerful thing --
the maternal instinct.

24:57.533 --> 25:00.035
Such a beautiful baby.

25:00.069 --> 25:01.903
Don't touch my baby!

25:01.938 --> 25:03.104
What? Who?

25:03.139 --> 25:07.409
It's not your baby.

25:07.477 --> 25:09.611
It's our baby.

25:35.721 --> 25:40.057
I almost didn't recognize you
without your costume.

25:40.092 --> 25:43.728
You've made the right decision
to submit, Tom Mason.

25:43.762 --> 25:46.998
Resistance will only ensure
the extinction of your species.

25:47.032 --> 25:51.102
The deal's off, and this is
your last chance to surrender.

25:51.169 --> 25:52.837
And this is your last chance
to recant

25:52.871 --> 25:54.872
before you're taken
from this prison

25:54.906 --> 25:57.908
and sent away
for processing.

25:57.943 --> 25:59.877
I take it that's a "no"?

26:32.310 --> 26:34.245
Aah! Sound the alarm!

26:34.312 --> 26:38.249
I want all arms
brought to bear on Mason!

26:38.316 --> 26:41.719
Take him alive! I want him!
Bring him to me!

26:44.089 --> 26:46.924
That's our cue, boys.
"Go" time.

26:52.297 --> 26:53.964
You all right?

26:54.032 --> 26:56.767
My hand!

27:00.272 --> 27:03.040
Southeast guys
are right on time.

27:05.310 --> 27:07.778
Whoa, northeast guys
are a little early.

27:07.813 --> 27:10.114
I can't feel my hand!

27:10.148 --> 27:14.385
Someone needs to get into
the suit now or Tom will die.

27:18.457 --> 27:19.924
I just missed my turn.

27:27.199 --> 27:30.267
No. No, no, no.

27:30.302 --> 27:32.837
You are not putting on no suit.
You got a heart condition.

27:32.871 --> 27:33.971
Nothing wrong
with my heart.

27:34.005 --> 27:35.239
Hearts work
on electrical pulses.

27:35.273 --> 27:36.807
The wall could kill you.

27:40.912 --> 27:42.513
I'll go.

27:42.547 --> 27:45.049
This whole damn thing goes
sideways, right,

27:45.083 --> 27:46.383
guess I won't
have to be here anymore.

27:46.418 --> 27:48.452
Yeah, I get it.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.633
You'll get out, 
you'll just skedaddle, huh?

27:49.657 --> 27:50.588
Just like Tom said, right?

27:50.589 --> 27:53.090
You know, we all got to start
trusting each other.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.159
It starts now.
Give me the damn suit.

27:55.193 --> 27:57.895
He's right. Okay.

27:57.929 --> 28:00.064
You want the suit?
Go ahead. Give me the suit.

28:00.098 --> 28:01.899
Come on.
Help me put it on.

28:01.933 --> 28:03.434
Remember,
you only get one chance...

28:03.502 --> 28:05.069
One chance.
...With this charge.

28:05.137 --> 28:06.270
Right.
Green wire, red wire.

28:06.304 --> 28:07.505
Red wire, green wire.
No!

28:07.539 --> 28:11.041
Green wire, red wire.
Twist.

28:11.076 --> 28:13.544
Beep, beep, beep, beep,
boom.

28:13.578 --> 28:15.379
Okay? All right. Boom. Beep, boom.
Got it, yeah.

28:15.413 --> 28:18.048
You only get 90 seconds.
Otherwise -- to get over the fence.

28:18.116 --> 28:20.217
It's fried Pope.
No! Vaporized Pope.

28:21.453 --> 28:22.586
Understand?

28:26.925 --> 28:29.894
Here's your bomb.

28:29.928 --> 28:32.396
We'll be ready to give you cover
in 30 seconds.

28:32.430 --> 28:34.265
Good luck.

28:47.913 --> 28:48.913
Go.

29:09.568 --> 29:13.204
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand,

29:13.238 --> 29:16.373
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand,

29:16.441 --> 29:19.076
five, one thousand,
six, one thousand,

29:19.110 --> 29:20.211
seven, one thousand...

29:37.095 --> 29:39.897
Let's go. He needs cover.
You ready?

29:45.670 --> 29:48.472
Fire!

29:50.075 --> 29:51.175
Boom! Yes!

29:52.711 --> 29:56.280
Aah! Aah! No!

29:56.314 --> 29:58.349
Oh, man,
you dropped the bomb!

29:58.383 --> 30:01.252
No, no!

30:03.688 --> 30:06.957
No explosive.
No escape.

30:13.632 --> 30:15.165
Over here.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.034
All right. Come on, people.
Get the lead out.

30:17.068 --> 30:20.037
Be careful.
Help each other.

30:21.439 --> 30:23.540
It's all good.

30:23.575 --> 30:26.010
Is that everybody?

30:26.077 --> 30:29.546
We did a final sweep.
It's everybody we can find.

30:31.483 --> 30:35.286
Come on, guys.
Just a little bit farther.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.657
He's gonna bail, save himself.
I knew I should have gone.

30:48.566 --> 30:50.467
I thought I was gonna
have to shoot him.

30:50.502 --> 30:52.336
Oh, he's not gonna have
enough time.

30:52.404 --> 30:54.505
Before the suit
falls apart.

30:56.441 --> 30:58.475
Good work, today, guys.
Looked good.

31:03.548 --> 31:05.215
Hurry up, Ellen.

31:08.353 --> 31:10.587
All right. Now we wait.

31:10.622 --> 31:12.456
Don't rush me, Henry.

31:12.524 --> 31:14.358
Okay.

31:17.529 --> 31:20.464
They're gonna leave us.

31:25.203 --> 31:27.738
He's only got
a few more seconds.

31:27.772 --> 31:30.140
Come on, Pope.

31:34.479 --> 31:36.080
Come on.

31:38.750 --> 31:41.051
His suit's falling apart!

31:55.200 --> 31:59.169
Oh, he's out cold.

32:15.504 --> 32:16.737
What was that?

32:20.475 --> 32:22.777
You're hearing things
again.

32:22.811 --> 32:26.147
Skitters!
They followed us in!

32:27.883 --> 32:30.184
Hey, watch out!
I'm coming through!

32:30.252 --> 32:33.354
Everybody get to the back!
Fall back! Fighters, follow me!

32:36.691 --> 32:39.560
Henry! Henry!

32:45.700 --> 32:49.703
Help me barricade the door!

32:53.475 --> 32:56.777
Get up.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby.

32:59.881 --> 33:01.448
Pope!
Get up!

33:01.516 --> 33:03.450
Get on your feet!

33:03.518 --> 33:06.153
Up! Get up, P ope!

33:06.188 --> 33:08.756
Get up!

33:08.824 --> 33:10.724
Come on!

33:14.863 --> 33:16.597
Come on.
Come on, you.

33:16.631 --> 33:18.499
Pope, you get
that bomb on there!

33:18.533 --> 33:20.801
Get that bomb on there!

33:28.443 --> 33:31.212
Red wire, green.

33:31.246 --> 33:32.880
Wire. Beep, beep...

33:32.948 --> 33:35.583
Beep, beep...Boom.

33:37.786 --> 33:39.286
Beep...

33:39.354 --> 33:40.821
Beep, boom.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.003
Oh, you got to
be kidding me!

33:58.673 --> 34:01.675
No, no, no!

34:14.522 --> 34:16.290
Stack it up!

34:56.498 --> 34:58.766
Come on, guys. The wall's
supposed to be down by now.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.802
- You do not quit!
- Pope, what are you doing?

35:01.836 --> 35:03.837
You hear me?

35:03.872 --> 35:06.573
Pope, hurry!

35:11.346 --> 35:13.547
Come on!

35:13.581 --> 35:15.582
Quick!

35:16.785 --> 35:18.285
Come on. Come on.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.621
Stupid!

35:20.655 --> 35:22.323
Kick!

35:26.461 --> 35:27.928
Son of a...

35:31.633 --> 35:35.302
All right!
It's working!

35:35.337 --> 35:36.770
- Yes!
- You did it.

35:36.805 --> 35:38.439
Whoo-hoo!

35:51.052 --> 35:54.621
Glad you could all make it.

36:09.871 --> 36:11.805
Yeah, the wall's down!

36:28.356 --> 36:30.524
Whoo!

36:34.396 --> 36:37.398
Pope, you did it.
Oh, I never doubted you for a second.

36:37.432 --> 36:41.835
Son of a bitch.
Pigs <i> can</i> fly.

36:47.075 --> 36:49.443
She's close.

36:51.546 --> 36:53.714
Hey, guys.

36:53.748 --> 36:56.050
Anne's awake.
Hey, take it easy.

36:56.084 --> 36:58.118
I'm okay.
I feel better.

36:58.153 --> 37:01.021
Don't bite off
more than you can chew.

37:01.056 --> 37:03.390
What do you have to chew?
I'm starving.

37:03.425 --> 37:05.059
Let's get Anne
some chow.

37:05.093 --> 37:08.028
Anthony, send three scouts
to explore the area

37:08.096 --> 37:10.898
out to a perimeter of five miles
in every direction but east.

37:10.932 --> 37:12.132
Of course.

37:12.167 --> 37:14.601
Thanks, Denny.
Why?

37:14.669 --> 37:17.471
Lexi's close.

37:17.505 --> 37:20.974
Well, how do we know
Lexi is close?

37:21.009 --> 37:23.510
I had a dream.

37:47.857 --> 37:52.093
Son of Tom Mason.

37:52.127 --> 37:56.998
Lexi, I want to believe
that you're the reason

37:57.032 --> 37:58.472
the Espheni haven't
attacked us here,

37:58.500 --> 38:01.436
but you can't blame Maggie,
or anyone, for being uneasy.

38:01.470 --> 38:04.505
Shh. Listen.

38:06.508 --> 38:08.343
I don't hear anything.

38:08.377 --> 38:10.511
Listen.

38:13.883 --> 38:16.184
They're almost here.

38:18.220 --> 38:20.488
I hear things
that you can't.

38:20.556 --> 38:24.859
I see things that you can't.
It scares me.

38:24.927 --> 38:28.129
I need you.

38:28.163 --> 38:30.331
Brother.

38:30.366 --> 38:33.902
Sister.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.119
Lourdes.

38:52.421 --> 38:56.124
Oh, Lourdes!

38:56.191 --> 38:57.859
Anne?

38:57.893 --> 39:00.428
Ben!
Anthony!

39:00.462 --> 39:01.963
I can't believe
you're here.

39:01.997 --> 39:03.498
Well, you better believe it.
Are you all right?

39:03.532 --> 39:07.535
I'm okay.

39:11.941 --> 39:14.542
Anne, this is gonna sound crazy,
but this is --

39:14.576 --> 39:16.411
I know who it is.

39:27.189 --> 39:29.590
Denny.

39:36.532 --> 39:38.900
It's my daughter.

39:43.572 --> 39:45.173
Come on, enough.
Will you?

39:45.207 --> 39:47.308
- Give me a break. Enough, already.
- Hey.

39:48.377 --> 39:50.878
Hal?

39:50.913 --> 39:53.214
Where's Hal?

39:53.248 --> 39:55.984
Hey. There he is.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.887
You all right?
Yeah.

39:59.922 --> 40:02.056
How did it go?
It was easy.

40:02.091 --> 40:03.932
I'm ready to liberate
another ghetto right now.

40:03.959 --> 40:05.159
Don't worry. We will.

40:05.194 --> 40:07.195
Hey, hey.

40:07.229 --> 40:08.896
Everybody make it out?

40:08.964 --> 40:12.100
No, not everybody.

40:12.134 --> 40:14.135
Most everybody?

40:14.169 --> 40:16.371
Yeah.

40:16.438 --> 40:18.272
Focus on that.

40:18.307 --> 40:21.109
Yeah.

40:21.143 --> 40:23.311
Well, John Pope.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.979
You're like a box
of chocolates --

40:25.047 --> 40:26.514
you just never know
what you're gonna get with you.

40:26.548 --> 40:28.216
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:28.250 --> 40:31.352
You know, you should,
uh, trust more.

40:31.420 --> 40:34.922
Yes.
You can't beat them alone.

40:34.957 --> 40:36.257
Good idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

40:36.291 --> 40:37.492
Man,
I thought we were toast

40:37.526 --> 40:39.093
when you dropped
that backpack, though.

40:39.128 --> 40:40.228
You dropped the backpack?

40:40.262 --> 40:42.096
I dropped nothing,
all right?

40:42.131 --> 40:44.999
I recovered my own fumble.
Thank you.

40:45.034 --> 40:47.635
You did it.

40:47.703 --> 40:49.537
You should get that hand
looked at, huh?

40:49.571 --> 40:51.406
Oh, yeah.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.241
I think we've got a medic
around here somewhere.

41:16.665 --> 41:20.001
You all right?

41:20.069 --> 41:21.369
Yeah.

41:21.403 --> 41:24.105
Just thought
I heard something.
