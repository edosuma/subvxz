00:09.406 --> 00:11.607
<i> So far, we have seen</i>

00:11.609 --> 00:14.409

00:17.346 --> 00:20.314
<i> Commissioner Gordon get a gift.</i>

00:23.384 --> 00:25.651
<i> 'X' mark the cat.</i>

<i> Catwoman bare her claws.</i>

00:31.857 --> 00:34.725
<i> Batman and Robin on guard.</i>

00:35.927 --> 00:38.528
<i> Robin, get it in the neck.</i>

00:40.864 --> 00:43.332
<i> Saved by Batman.</i>

00:47.337 --> 00:49.004
<i> "Open Sesame."</i>

00:49.939 --> 00:52.040
<i> "Is this trick necessary?"</i>

00:54.743 --> 00:56.677
<i> Sharp tactics.</i>

00:59.947 --> 01:02.615
<i> Two mice in a cat-trap.</i>

You can't stay
there forever, Batman.

03:27.112 --> 03:29.579
Your hands will
lose their strength.

03:29.581 --> 03:31.881
Not while I have a breath left.

03:31.883 --> 03:35.885
It's been a long time
between bites for Tinker Bell.

03:35.887 --> 03:38.654
You should take
better care of him, Catwoman.

03:38.656 --> 03:41.857
After all, pets are
a responsibility.

03:43.794 --> 03:45.760
Batman, it's been fun,

03:45.762 --> 03:48.095
but all good things
must come to an end.

03:48.097 --> 03:51.665
And the goodest ending
I can think of is yours.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.166
It's not ended yet.

03:53.168 --> 03:54.834
'It will soon.'

03:54.836 --> 03:56.869
'It's a pity
I can't stay and watch'

03:56.871 --> 04:00.739
but you know how
I hate the sight of blood.

04:01.006 --> 04:01.972
TTFN.

04:01.974 --> 04:04.908
'And what's
that supposed to mean?'

04:04.910 --> 04:06.809
"Ta-Ta For Now."

04:06.811 --> 04:09.011
I'm off to pluck
Robin's feathers.

04:36.103 --> 04:38.971
<i> Calling on his fantastic</i>
<i> storehouse</i>

04:38.973 --> 04:40.272
<i> of audio engineering knowledge</i>

04:40.274 --> 04:45.877
<i> Batman, nimbly reverses the</i>
<i> polarity on his communicator..</i>

04:46.044 --> 04:48.945
<i> ...then increases</i>
<i> the audio modulation</i>

04:48.947 --> 04:50.713
<i>  to about 20,000 decibels</i>

04:50.715 --> 04:54.683
<i> knowing full well, it will</i>
<i> split the tiger's skull.</i>

05:52.206 --> 05:53.940
Don't bother, Robin,
you wouldn't know

05:53.942 --> 05:56.909
to get out of here
even if you get loose.

05:56.911 --> 05:57.776
Just you wait, Catwoman.

05:57.778 --> 06:01.045
Batman will be here
in a minute and you'll be sorry.

06:01.047 --> 06:03.147
He'll have to come a long way.

06:03.149 --> 06:06.350
We know what you're up to.

06:06.352 --> 06:08.318
Is that so?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.385
Tell me more.

06:09.387 --> 06:11.687
You wanna steal
Mark Andrews' collection

06:11.689 --> 06:12.688
Well, it just won't work.

06:12.690 --> 06:14.990
The place is
surrounded by police.

06:14.992 --> 06:16.858
Thanks for that information

06:16.860 --> 06:19.727
but that doesn't
change my plans one bit.

06:19.729 --> 06:22.629
You're racing
up the wrong alley.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.865
Felix, Leo, take Robin
down and clip his wings.

06:38.744 --> 06:40.678
<i> What now, Cowled Crusader?</i>

06:40.680 --> 06:42.880
Is that a "Cul-de-sac"?

07:02.400 --> 07:03.666
Did you weigh him?

07:03.668 --> 07:05.968
132 pounds 10 ounces.

07:05.970 --> 07:07.102
Is that sand ready?

07:07.104 --> 07:08.770
All ready, Catwoman.

07:08.772 --> 07:11.139
Good, I'll baste him.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.088
Purr-fect.

07:28.090 --> 07:30.190
To the pit with him.

07:34.161 --> 07:36.028
The sand.

07:41.167 --> 07:44.802
132 pounds 10 ounces exactly.

07:54.778 --> 07:55.811
Catwoman.

07:55.813 --> 07:58.346
You are not a nice person.

07:59.081 --> 08:01.449
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

08:01.783 --> 08:05.185
You must be curious, Boy Wonder,
why this strange feeding method.

08:05.187 --> 08:09.322
I'm always interested in the
workings of the criminal mind.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.860
My pets are orderly beasts
and must be fed on time.

08:15.862 --> 08:18.729
'So, when enough sand runs out'

08:18.731 --> 08:20.430
Dinner is served.

08:29.207 --> 08:30.472
<i> Precious moments lost.</i>

08:30.474 --> 08:34.174
<i> There's only one</i>
<i> possible way out.</i>

08:35.744 --> 08:36.876
Well..

08:36.879 --> 08:38.879
...I have personal engagements
elsewhere.

08:38.881 --> 08:42.816
My untrustworthy aides will
take care of the details.

08:42.818 --> 08:44.884
Felix, Leo..

08:44.886 --> 08:46.051
...I'll meet you two later.

08:46.053 --> 08:48.353
'Right, Catwoman.

08:48.355 --> 08:49.220
Farewell, my lovely.

08:49.222 --> 08:52.056
'Give my best to Batman
when you see him'

08:52.058 --> 08:54.858
at that great
scratching post in the sky.

09:22.352 --> 09:28.156
<i> As the sands of time</i>
<i> run out for the Boy Wonder..</i>

11:35.549 --> 11:36.582
We'll tie him up, Robin

11:36.584 --> 11:37.916
then we'll call
headquarters

11:37.918 --> 11:41.185
and have O'Hara's men
come pick 'em up.

11:51.095 --> 11:53.663
'Batman, he's trying to escape.'

11:55.532 --> 11:57.332
Maybe we can still catch him.

11:57.334 --> 12:00.134
Better still, Let's
investigate this lair.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.336
Perhaps, we'll find Catwoman.

12:11.379 --> 12:14.047
Yeah, okay, Charlie, okay.

12:20.554 --> 12:21.186
Yes?

12:21.488 --> 12:24.822
Oh, Boy Wonder, now I just
returned from a late session

12:24.824 --> 12:28.358
at the mayor's office.
Uh, he wants action, fast.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.561
- 'Anything I can tell him?'
- Yes, commissioner.

12:31.563 --> 12:33.329
We've captured one
of Catwoman's mob.

12:33.331 --> 12:37.266
Chief O'Hara can pick him up
at the Gato and Chat warehouse

12:37.268 --> 12:38.667
at 2809 West 20th street.

12:38.669 --> 12:42.604
Wonderful, but tell me, uh,
is there any word on Catwoman?

12:42.606 --> 12:45.607
She and her right-hand man
Leo made a clean getaway.

12:45.609 --> 12:46.941
But, we found
the cats in her office.

12:46.943 --> 12:48.809
'That should take
some pressure off.'

12:48.811 --> 12:51.745
'Does Batman have any inkling
of Catwoman's whereabouts?'

12:51.747 --> 12:54.881
No, sir. Any word from the
stake-out at the Andrews' house?

12:54.883 --> 12:57.550
Now, I'm in constant
contact with them, Boy Wonder.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.286
But, uh, there's
no sign of Catwoman.

13:00.288 --> 13:02.921
Nothing at the Andrews' house.

13:02.923 --> 13:03.554
Well..

13:03.556 --> 13:05.489
...then the next move
is up to us.

13:05.491 --> 13:07.591
Tell the commissioner
we'll be in touch.

13:07.593 --> 13:09.326
Commissioner,
we'll be in touch.

13:09.328 --> 13:10.794
Over and out

13:10.796 --> 13:12.896
and good luck.

13:14.465 --> 13:16.365
To all of us.

13:17.133 --> 13:20.201
I don't understand why Catwoman
would leave these behind.

13:20.203 --> 13:23.637
Especially, after going to such
great lengths to steal them.

13:23.639 --> 13:26.172
Perhaps, she had
another use for them.

13:26.174 --> 13:28.507
We'll find out when we examine.

13:28.509 --> 13:32.611
Besides, she really didn't
leave them behind.

13:32.613 --> 13:35.714
She probably,
expected to return.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.855
They've got to be the answer.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.723
Well, we've tried everything.

13:46.725 --> 13:50.326
The Metal Analyzer,
the Spectroscope..

13:50.328 --> 13:51.561
...both negative.

13:51.563 --> 13:53.229
No hidden compartments.

13:53.231 --> 13:53.963
I just don't understand it.

13:53.965 --> 13:57.900
Look at the back of this cat,
Robin, what do you see?

13:57.902 --> 14:00.302
Just some funny markings.

14:00.304 --> 14:01.536
Why?

14:01.538 --> 14:03.638
Look at the other one.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.007
Well...some different markings.

14:06.009 --> 14:09.810
These cats are
supposed to be identical.

14:11.379 --> 14:12.479
Wait a moment.

14:12.481 --> 14:14.814
Something just occurred to me.

14:22.355 --> 14:24.823
There's an obscure legend.

14:24.825 --> 14:28.259
These cats once belonged
to the notorious pirate

14:28.261 --> 14:28.826
Captain Manx.

14:28.828 --> 14:31.028
Isn't he the pirate who willed
his treasure

14:31.030 --> 14:32.996
to the underprivileged
children of Gotham City?

14:32.998 --> 14:35.898
As a sort of repayment
for all the havoc he wreaked

14:35.900 --> 14:39.668
on the city's ships
when it was first founded?

14:39.670 --> 14:42.303
The unique thing
about the legend is that they

14:42.305 --> 14:45.306
never recovered
one gold doubloon.

14:45.308 --> 14:46.573
Holy felony.

14:46.575 --> 14:48.474
Do you think Catwoman
stumbled on to this?

14:48.476 --> 14:50.843
We'll know as soon as
I find the information here

14:50.845 --> 14:55.781
in the second volume of
'The History of Gotham City'.

15:05.991 --> 15:07.825
What happened?

15:08.726 --> 15:10.493
Where's Felix?

15:10.694 --> 15:11.527
It's a long story.

15:11.529 --> 15:14.029
Well, I don't have
time for long stories.

15:14.031 --> 15:16.297
Where are the cats?

15:16.698 --> 15:19.733
You did save the cats,
didn't you?

15:19.735 --> 15:20.800
Batman got 'em.

15:20.802 --> 15:22.902
Batman got them!

15:22.904 --> 15:24.069
Well, that does it.

15:24.071 --> 15:27.872
That's another fine mess
you got us into, Leo.

15:29.441 --> 15:30.040
Alright.

15:30.042 --> 15:31.975
Let's hit up the Batman
reception.

15:31.977 --> 15:33.710
Now that Batman
has got the cats

15:33.712 --> 15:36.813
he's bound to figure
out their secret.

15:37.614 --> 15:39.848
Put alternate Plan B
into effect.

15:40.851 --> 15:41.716
Great Scott, I found it.

15:41.718 --> 15:45.653
It's just as I remembered it.
Look here, Robin.

15:46.087 --> 15:49.055
This is the shape
of Gotham city in those days.

15:49.057 --> 15:51.824
Since then, a lot more
land has been added.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.459
But does this pattern look
familiar to you.

15:54.461 --> 15:56.093
Holy geography, of course!

15:56.095 --> 15:57.961
That's the same
markings we found

15:57.963 --> 15:59.996
when you put the
two cats together.

15:59.998 --> 16:03.499
Holy geography, indeed, Robin.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.668
Without each other,
these two cats are useless.

16:06.670 --> 16:10.405
But when put together, they
form a map that will lead us

16:10.407 --> 16:12.407
right to the hidden
treasure chest

16:12.409 --> 16:14.776
of Pirate Captain Manx himself.

16:14.778 --> 16:15.676
Gosh, Batman!

16:15.678 --> 16:16.777
'Now the question is'

16:16.779 --> 16:18.745
Where is Catwoman?

16:18.879 --> 16:19.411
Hmm.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.814
Look, Catwoman still had these
cats in her possession.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.016
We'd have no trouble
finding her.

16:25.018 --> 16:28.586
That radioactive spray
we used still shows up.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.621
Yes, you are absolutely correct.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.723
Don't hold that cat
so close to your face.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.592
'Some of the radioactive
spray may rub off on you.'

16:35.594 --> 16:38.962
Right, I should have
thought of that myself.

16:40.798 --> 16:41.664
Batman.

16:41.866 --> 16:43.432
'Yes, Robin.'

16:43.434 --> 16:45.400
If someone were to hold

16:45.402 --> 16:48.369
these cats close enough
and long enough.

16:48.371 --> 16:50.571
Do you suppose,
some of the radioactivity

16:50.573 --> 16:52.406
might show up on the person?

16:52.408 --> 16:53.874
Yes, quite possibly.

16:53.876 --> 16:57.310
Well, Catwoman was
holding the cats.

16:57.312 --> 16:57.877
And..

16:57.879 --> 17:00.746
And we switch on the
Bat-o-meter.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.789
Batman!
The Bat-o-meter's going crazy.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.223
Of course, the cats are
disturbing the calibration.

17:15.226 --> 17:18.961
Better put them in the lead
shielding compartment.

17:30.173 --> 17:31.106
There, there Batman!

17:31.108 --> 17:32.340
'There's the blip.'

17:32.342 --> 17:34.075
'She's out on McGilroy..'

17:34.077 --> 17:36.177
There's only one road
leading into that area.

17:36.179 --> 17:39.980
And if the Catwoman knows we are
coming, she'll be ready for us.

17:39.982 --> 17:42.315
Better use the Bat-armor.
Let's go!

18:02.066 --> 18:04.434
- 'Did you get the road mine?'
- Yes, ma'am.

18:04.436 --> 18:08.037
Good. I've got the spot
in the cave marked.

18:08.039 --> 18:09.805
Get the tools.

18:22.950 --> 18:23.983
At last..

18:24.085 --> 18:26.185
...the plunder
of a dozen galleys.

18:26.287 --> 18:29.388
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.257
Never again to face
deprivation.

18:32.259 --> 18:36.327
From now on,
pussy will ooze galore.

18:36.329 --> 18:37.294
I'm rich!

18:37.296 --> 18:39.329
We are rich, Catwoman.

18:40.497 --> 18:40.829
How?

18:40.831 --> 18:44.032
They thought we were after
the Mark Andrew's collection.

18:45.602 --> 18:49.404
They thought they were dealing
with an ordinary cat burglar.

18:49.406 --> 18:50.271
Here.

18:50.273 --> 18:51.071
'Fill this up.'

18:51.073 --> 18:53.073
'That chest is so clumsy.'

18:53.075 --> 18:56.509
And now there's just
two of us left to share it.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.278
Yeah.

19:00.414 --> 19:03.181
Just...two of us.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.928
Just as I thought, she has
mined the road with explosives.

19:22.930 --> 19:25.764
No wonder, you had me put
on the Bat-armor. Gosh!

19:25.766 --> 19:27.432
You really think
of everything, Batman.

19:31.736 --> 19:32.902
What's that?

19:34.204 --> 19:37.004
Although the Bat-armor
protected our car.

19:37.006 --> 19:38.438
Those land mines blew our tires.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.475
Robin, turn on the automatic
tire repair device.

20:14.271 --> 20:16.272
She's within a hundred
feet of here.

20:16.274 --> 20:18.407
'Yeah, but where?'

20:18.408 --> 20:20.842
What about those footprints.

20:26.182 --> 20:27.548
Only one man has feet that big.

20:27.550 --> 20:31.118
There must be an opening
somewhere near here.

20:34.988 --> 20:39.591
Boy, I wonder
what my end's gonna be?

20:41.293 --> 20:42.693
Argh.

20:42.894 --> 20:44.628
This.

20:49.834 --> 20:52.836
There's never enough for two.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.908
Stay right where you are,
Catwoman.

21:34.574 --> 21:35.373
Don't!

21:35.375 --> 21:36.407
Don't do it, Catwoman.

21:36.409 --> 21:40.043
You'll never make that jump
with what you're carrying.

21:40.045 --> 21:42.578
Just watch me, Batman.

21:48.616 --> 21:51.451
- Batman!
- Help me.

21:51.453 --> 21:52.051
Hang on, Catwoman.

21:52.053 --> 21:55.954
When I thrown the Bat-rope,
reach out and catch it.

21:56.322 --> 21:57.855
I'm afraid.

21:58.623 --> 21:59.556
Let go of the bag, Catwoman.

21:59.558 --> 22:03.426
Then you'll be able to catch
the rope with your free hand.

22:03.428 --> 22:05.795
I can't let go of it.

22:07.063 --> 22:08.029
Drop it, Catwoman.

22:08.031 --> 22:11.465
Otherwise you'll fall
into that bottomless pit.

22:11.467 --> 22:13.433
Nothing's worth that.

22:13.667 --> 22:18.404
I can't let go.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.375
I can't!

22:29.447 --> 22:30.613
Catwoman!

22:30.615 --> 22:32.482
Can you hear me?

22:33.484 --> 22:35.051
Catwoman!

22:42.959 --> 22:44.926
It's no use, Robin.

22:44.928 --> 22:48.029
She probably went
straight to the bottom.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.801
Why didn't she let
go of the bag?

22:54.803 --> 22:56.536
Didn't she know,
what would happen?

22:56.538 --> 22:58.004
Greed is an overpowering
emotion, Robin.

22:58.006 --> 23:00.206
It sometimes dims
all the senses

23:00.208 --> 23:02.741
even that of self-preservation.

23:02.743 --> 23:06.244
I suppose in the end that's
what trips up all criminals.

23:06.246 --> 23:08.779
You think she might
still be alive?

23:08.781 --> 23:12.182
A cat is supposed
to have nine lives.

23:12.184 --> 23:14.050
It's hard to say.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.021
Bishop.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.655
Queen six.

23:20.657 --> 23:21.989
Third level.

23:21.991 --> 23:23.557
This will take a minute, Bruce.

23:23.559 --> 23:26.726
I didn't figure
on that move at all.

23:28.261 --> 23:29.861
Uh.

23:29.863 --> 23:33.264
Begging your pardon,
Master Dick. But ah..

23:33.266 --> 23:35.699
A knight takes bishop play.

23:35.701 --> 23:37.233
Might seem in order here.

23:37.235 --> 23:39.201
Thank you, Alfred.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.639
Ah, in that case.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.675
Queen takes knight
and checkmate.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.878
'I said no, you devil!'

23:51.880 --> 23:53.946
Oh, honestly..

23:54.180 --> 23:57.248
- 'I couldn't have--'
- 'What's wrong, Aunt Harriet?'

23:57.250 --> 23:59.950
It's this infernal cat.

23:59.952 --> 24:01.685
The little heathen
stole the lobster

24:01.687 --> 24:03.953
I was preparing
for your dinner.

24:03.955 --> 24:05.254
This cat is a thief.

24:05.256 --> 24:08.190
And we are doing our
best to rehabilitate.

24:08.192 --> 24:11.193
Well, it steals everything
it can it's paws on.

24:11.195 --> 24:13.161
'You have to understand,
Aunt Harriet.'

24:13.163 --> 24:15.963
The cat comes
from a broken home.

24:21.435 --> 24:23.202
Master Dick.

24:24.002 --> 24:25.002
