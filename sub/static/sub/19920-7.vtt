00:00.022 --> 00:02.140
<i>Previously on "Shots Fired"...</i>

00:02.272 --> 00:04.312
Please drop this custody suit.

00:04.406 --> 00:05.846
It should have never happened, baby.

00:10.746 --> 00:12.632
The governor called me personally.

00:12.714 --> 00:15.516
She wants a black prosecutor
out front... optics.

00:15.584 --> 00:17.118
All the murdering of unarmed black men

00:17.186 --> 00:18.953
by police across this country,

00:19.021 --> 00:21.656
and this is the one that
the government is investigating?

00:21.723 --> 00:23.257
Refusing a sobriety test,

00:23.325 --> 00:24.525
assaulting an officer,

00:24.593 --> 00:25.960
and resisting arrest

00:26.028 --> 00:28.429
certainly won't get you
your daughter back.

00:28.497 --> 00:30.598
I'm placing you on administrative leave

00:30.666 --> 00:33.034
with pay until this is resolved.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.504
Your mother and I, we're taking
a loan against the house.

00:36.572 --> 00:39.373
We're gonna have enough
to cover your legal fees.

00:39.441 --> 00:41.519
Joey Campbell's murderer...
you were there that night.

00:41.543 --> 00:42.977
- Who says?
- His mother.

00:47.916 --> 00:51.319
I am not declaring war on my citizens.

00:51.386 --> 00:53.721
Your citizens have already
declared war on you.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.231
Shut that thing off!

01:03.298 --> 01:05.066
What are you doing, damn it?

01:10.372 --> 01:11.939
Come here!

01:12.007 --> 01:13.574
Get off my son!

01:13.642 --> 01:15.409
Get off!

01:15.477 --> 01:16.677
That's my mom!

01:16.745 --> 01:18.446
Son!

01:23.719 --> 01:25.820
Extra patrols...

01:30.359 --> 01:32.293
With the exception of a few isolated

01:32.361 --> 01:35.830
pockets of unrest, the violence
seems to be contained.

01:35.898 --> 01:38.766
But we're all on alert should
there be any more incidents.

01:38.834 --> 01:41.602
That video of you is all over
social media, Lieutenant.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.537
How does it feel to be a hero?

01:43.605 --> 01:46.307
I'm no hero... I'm just doing my job.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.511
The Tours part of your job?

01:50.579 --> 01:51.846
Yes, ma'am.

01:51.914 --> 01:54.982
I'd like you to be straight with me.

01:55.050 --> 01:57.852
Were there any abuses
within the program?

01:57.920 --> 02:01.789
If there were, I would've reported
them immediately to Sheriff Platt.

02:03.683 --> 02:05.059
Of course.

02:16.004 --> 02:17.438
Stop right there!

02:20.208 --> 02:22.476
Stop here. Stop.

02:26.515 --> 02:28.249
Stop resisting!

02:28.317 --> 02:29.650
Get those people back.

02:29.718 --> 02:31.452
Get back, now!

02:31.520 --> 02:33.187
Is this level of force necessary?

02:33.255 --> 02:35.157
He was noncompliant
with the officers, Governor.

02:35.182 --> 02:36.367
What's the governor doing here?

02:36.391 --> 02:38.459
Move back!

02:38.527 --> 02:39.607
What did this young man do?

02:39.661 --> 02:41.829
He vandalized that building
with spray paint.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.274
Consider this a pardon.

02:58.780 --> 02:59.914
We should leave, ma'am.

03:36.752 --> 03:38.119
Preston Terry.

03:38.186 --> 03:39.653
This is Deputy Carroll.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.455
<i>Hey, how are you, sir?</i>

03:41.523 --> 03:43.003
I've been trying to explain to the AG

03:43.058 --> 03:45.426
why this investigation's
produced no meaningful results.

03:45.494 --> 03:48.162
Sir, just because I haven't
charged Deputy Beck

03:48.230 --> 03:50.097
with the murder of Jesse Carr
doesn't mean

03:50.165 --> 03:51.999
that we're wasting our time here.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.578
We've uncovered a level
of police corruption

03:53.602 --> 03:55.046
within the Gate Station
Sheriff's Department.

03:55.070 --> 03:56.837
<i>That's obviously over your head.</i>

03:56.905 --> 03:59.673
<i>I take it you haven't spoken to Akino.</i>

03:59.741 --> 04:00.808
She gets back today.

04:00.876 --> 04:03.644
Then I'll be the bearer of bad news.
You're being replaced.

04:03.712 --> 04:04.779
Excuse me?

04:04.846 --> 04:06.320
<i>I've assigned another team</i>

04:06.345 --> 04:08.149
<i>that will arrive next week...
you're done.</i>

04:08.216 --> 04:11.085
Sir, sir, that will be a huge mistake.

04:11.153 --> 04:13.821
No, the mistake was putting you
in a situation

04:13.889 --> 04:15.623
you're not quite qualified to handle.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.695
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:16.720 --> 04:19.160
<i>Be prepared to hand over
when they arrive.</i>

04:23.031 --> 04:24.331
What the hell?

04:29.738 --> 04:31.806
<i>This is Ashe, leave it here.</i>

04:34.309 --> 04:36.577
Thanks for meeting me.

04:36.645 --> 04:39.223
I'm listening.

04:39.762 --> 04:42.750
An eyewitness to a murder
came forward a few months back,

04:42.818 --> 04:44.926
ID'd the shooter as a drug
dealer named Calvin.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.655
Testimony seemed totally legit.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.623
Then when it went to trial,
that same eyewitness

04:49.691 --> 04:51.826
recanted his story.

04:51.893 --> 04:54.005
Admitted he lied about ever
seeing Calvin shoot someone.

04:54.029 --> 04:55.469
So what, he made the whole story up?

04:55.530 --> 04:57.198
A nice little fairy tale.

04:57.265 --> 04:59.800
What does that have to do
with any one of my cases?

04:59.868 --> 05:01.508
The witness fabricated his story because.

05:01.536 --> 05:04.271
Pastor Janae didn't like Calvin.

05:04.339 --> 05:06.640
He was a drug dealer...
she wanted him off the streets.

05:06.708 --> 05:09.143
It's all here if you want to see it.

05:09.211 --> 05:12.046
The word is your case
is hanging on an eyewitness.

05:12.114 --> 05:14.448
If I were you, I'd take
a hard look at them.

05:14.516 --> 05:18.119
People will say whatever the
dollar or the pastor calls for.

05:18.186 --> 05:20.254
And you just wanted to look out for me.

05:20.322 --> 05:22.323
No.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.126
No, you're destroying my town
and my best friend's life.

05:25.193 --> 05:27.962
I want the DOJ out of Gate Station.

05:28.029 --> 05:31.165
No, you've caused enough problems.

05:43.378 --> 05:44.512
Where's Kai?

05:44.579 --> 05:46.113
<i>Out with her father.</i>

05:46.181 --> 05:47.481
I'll call back.

05:47.549 --> 05:48.916
<i>Javi told me everything.</i>

05:51.586 --> 05:53.420
I'm sure not everything.

05:53.488 --> 05:55.923
<i>We're gonna go to counseling.</i>

05:55.991 --> 05:57.591
<i>We're gonna be okay.</i>

05:57.659 --> 05:59.693
<i>But he's not dropping the custody case.</i>

06:01.930 --> 06:04.231
<i>I think you're a crazy bitch.</i>

06:04.299 --> 06:07.034
<i>You're no good for Kai.</i>

06:07.102 --> 06:10.638
I slept with your man,
made him say my name.

06:10.705 --> 06:12.373
And you're gonna stay?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.643
You're weak, Paula.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.655
And you're out of your mind
if you think I'm gonna

06:17.679 --> 06:19.380
let Kai learn that from you.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.649
<i>Walking away would have been easy.</i>

06:30.625 --> 06:32.259
<i>Claims residents of the community</i>

06:32.327 --> 06:33.494
<i>assist in the clean up.</i>

06:33.562 --> 06:35.380
<i>However, tensions remain high.</i>

06:35.458 --> 06:38.399
<i>The backlash is from the
investigation into the murder</i>

06:38.466 --> 06:40.634
<i>of Joey Campbell that has
produced little results</i>

06:40.702 --> 06:43.437
<i>and no answers to the mother
of the slain victim.</i>

06:43.505 --> 06:45.506
<i>As protestors spill into the streets,</i>

06:45.574 --> 06:47.575
<i>the beleaguered police force
was reinforced</i>

06:47.642 --> 06:49.977
<i>by a military presence and a tank.</i>

06:50.045 --> 06:54.210
<i>Some say this made an already
combustible situation even worse.</i>

06:54.235 --> 06:55.616
<i>Which way are the tanks driving?</i>

06:55.684 --> 06:56.951
<i>Toward us.</i>

06:57.018 --> 06:58.586
Which way are the guns pointed?

06:58.653 --> 07:00.015
<i>At us.</i>

07:00.040 --> 07:02.423
<i>But this city's been burning
long before anyone lit a match.</i>

07:02.490 --> 07:05.675
<i>So y'all either don't know,
or y'all just don't give a damn.</i>

07:05.746 --> 07:07.449
<i>Justice for Joey Campbell.</i>

07:07.543 --> 07:09.113
<i>Justice for Joey Campbell.</i>

07:09.183 --> 07:11.339
<i>- No justice, no peace.
- No peace.</i>

07:11.418 --> 07:15.202
<i>No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!</i>

07:15.270 --> 07:16.904
<i>Authorities are bracing themselves</i>

07:16.972 --> 07:18.616
<i>for another night of
unrest as residents...</i>

07:18.640 --> 07:20.307
<i>"What about Joey" became...</i>

07:20.375 --> 07:22.309
<i>protests that led to a day
of violence</i>

07:22.377 --> 07:24.078
<i>in Gates Station, North Carolina.</i>

07:24.145 --> 07:25.755
<i>While many called this a riot,</i>

07:25.825 --> 07:27.237
<i>residents of this small town
called it an uprising...</i>

07:27.261 --> 07:28.616
Sorry, wrong table...

07:32.454 --> 07:34.255
I'll take what she's having.

07:35.857 --> 07:37.391
Vodka orange juice.

07:37.459 --> 07:40.094
Guess the orange juice
makes it breakfast.

07:43.531 --> 07:47.130
So are we drinking out of regret
or to forget?

07:47.329 --> 07:48.696
Here you go.

07:50.071 --> 07:51.972
Maybe both.

07:53.708 --> 07:56.644
To the mistakes we made today.

07:56.711 --> 07:59.313
May we survive the ones
we make tomorrow.

08:01.079 --> 08:02.720
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

08:02.797 --> 08:05.798
<i>for flight 7044 to New York JFK.</i>

08:10.292 --> 08:11.725
You wanna get out of here?

08:15.463 --> 08:16.964
Wait, you serious?

08:17.032 --> 08:20.367
What, you got something
against meaningless sex?

08:20.435 --> 08:23.437
I just know that sex is about
everything but the sex.

08:23.505 --> 08:25.939
I'm curious to know
what this is for you.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.409
Don't do that.

08:28.476 --> 08:32.913
I mean, what was your endgame
when you came over here?

08:32.981 --> 08:37.985
We exchange contact info,
send dirty pics back and forth,

08:38.053 --> 08:39.919
sneak away from your wife

08:39.988 --> 08:43.157
once or twice a year for
a long-distance booty call?

08:43.224 --> 08:45.225
I'm just cutting out the nonsense.

08:45.293 --> 08:48.395
I considered all that, yeah.

08:49.103 --> 08:52.437
Except for the dirty pics.
I may want to run for office one day.

08:57.505 --> 09:00.016
I parked in long-term.

09:00.742 --> 09:02.563
Meaningless enough for you?

09:12.020 --> 09:14.017
Have a safe flight.

09:22.497 --> 09:24.765
<i>In North Carolina
as peaceful protestors</i>

09:24.833 --> 09:26.300
<i>took a violent turn yesterday</i>

09:26.368 --> 09:28.576
<i>when demonstrators clashed
with authorities.</i>

09:28.686 --> 09:31.105
<i>However, the actions
of one police officer</i>

09:31.172 --> 09:33.240
<i>made a bold statement against injustice.</i>

09:33.308 --> 09:35.542
<i>Some hope his actions illustrate
there is a hope</i>

09:35.610 --> 09:37.311
<i>for healing between law enforcement</i>

09:37.379 --> 09:38.791
<i>and African-American residents.</i>

09:38.861 --> 09:40.280
<i>Others remain skeptical.</i>

09:40.348 --> 09:42.149
<i>Flight 610 to Charlotte is now boarding.</i>

09:42.217 --> 09:44.603
<i>Passengers please proceed to Gate D3.</i>

09:44.666 --> 09:45.759
Give me another one.

09:45.837 --> 09:47.077
<i>Who were arrested yesterday.</i>

09:47.102 --> 09:48.992
<i>Sheriff Platt of the Gates
Station Sheriff's Department</i>

09:49.016 --> 09:51.658
<i>says these recent acts of
violence will not be tolerated.</i>

09:51.726 --> 09:55.073
<i>The community has countered
that to get justice for Carr,</i>

09:55.159 --> 09:56.308
<i>they're willing to do</i>

09:56.386 --> 09:58.399
<i>- whatever it takes to be heard.
- No.</i>

09:58.466 --> 09:59.906
<i>They are calling on the president...</i>

10:06.741 --> 10:09.943
Be careful trying to pick that up.

10:11.428 --> 10:13.231
All right, load 'em up.

10:13.232 --> 10:14.982
Just take it to the
dumpster on the side.

10:59.928 --> 11:01.472
Mr. D?

11:02.964 --> 11:05.265
I just wanted to check on you.

11:06.128 --> 11:07.601
I...

11:08.800 --> 11:11.472
I don't know what's supposed
to be gained by all this.

11:14.476 --> 11:18.178
I knew this boy in 'Nam.

11:18.246 --> 11:20.368
Stabbed himself with a bayonet,

11:20.712 --> 11:23.454
ruptured an artery, and almost died.

11:23.852 --> 11:26.687
We were fighting an enemy
we couldn't see,

11:26.754 --> 11:28.956
and there was no way to win.

11:29.023 --> 11:31.692
The best you could hope for
in that bush was a way out.

11:35.096 --> 11:38.131
The boy in 'Nam got sent home.

11:38.199 --> 11:43.670
We did this to ourselves
and still can't get out.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.188
I'm sorry.

11:48.176 --> 11:50.313
I never meant for this to happen.

11:51.212 --> 11:52.813
I just wanted to help.

11:59.721 --> 12:02.789
The Department of Justice is pulling me
from this investigation.

12:04.492 --> 12:06.627
Looks like you bleeding out, too.

12:07.264 --> 12:09.332
Mr. Dabney.

12:12.534 --> 12:14.468
I'm so sorry.

12:14.536 --> 12:17.437
Thank you, Ms. Woods.

12:17.505 --> 12:19.439
Me too.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.814
Mr. Terry?

12:27.882 --> 12:30.350
<i>I'm Shirlane Woods
with Gate Newspaper...</i>

12:30.418 --> 12:32.352
Yes, I remember.

12:32.420 --> 12:35.191
Any words for the people
of this community?

12:35.690 --> 12:37.535
Any words?

12:37.892 --> 12:39.449
Yeah.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.261
Now what?

12:41.714 --> 12:44.865
Are you asking on behalf
of the DOJ or yourself?

12:49.671 --> 12:50.971
Off the record.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.842
I'm angry at the people who did this.

12:55.910 --> 12:59.212
I'm angry at the shootings
of Jesse and Joey.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.715
I'm angry at myself for...

13:08.556 --> 13:10.324
Turn it back on.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.942
The Department of Justice
is concerned for the safety

13:17.966 --> 13:20.467
and well-being of all
members of the community.

13:20.535 --> 13:22.936
We're offering our
assistance to the governor

13:23.004 --> 13:26.907
and local law enforcement in
whatever way they should require.

13:28.861 --> 13:31.979
I wish I could have done more, too.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.799
Your partner's out in the neighborhood.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.654
Thought you might need a ride.

13:46.384 --> 13:48.958
Ubering for extra cash, Lieutenant?

13:49.025 --> 13:51.312
Figured you'd just dip
into the evidence locker

13:51.337 --> 13:52.837
when you get strapped.

13:52.862 --> 13:55.965
Well, I doubt you came out
of the cartels squeaky clean.

13:56.032 --> 13:59.135
So your plan was just
to hang out here all day,

13:59.202 --> 14:00.870
hoping to catch me off guard?

14:00.937 --> 14:02.705
I was concerned about you.

14:02.773 --> 14:05.775
Must be tough fighting your
baby-daddy for your little girl.

14:05.842 --> 14:07.042
I don't know what I'd do

14:07.110 --> 14:08.488
if somebody took my daughters away,

14:08.512 --> 14:11.046
especially if it was my fault.

14:11.114 --> 14:14.083
Fortunately, I don't have
to worry about that.

14:14.151 --> 14:16.385
Right.

14:16.453 --> 14:18.097
But I'm sure you want
to get this whole thing

14:18.121 --> 14:21.457
wrapped up so that you can
get home to your little angel.

14:22.196 --> 14:25.954
Before you go, maybe
you'll let me buy you a drink.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.798
I'll drive this time.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.954
Hey.

14:53.323 --> 14:55.124
Damn.

14:55.192 --> 14:57.927
I've never seen anything like it.

14:57.994 --> 15:01.030
Air was so thick with smoke
I could hardly breathe.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.101
You obviously got my message
about meeting me here.

15:06.169 --> 15:07.636
Yeah.

15:08.897 --> 15:10.642
You get my other messages?

15:10.709 --> 15:12.365
Yeah.

15:12.809 --> 15:15.277
I've been caught up
in my own stuff... sorry.

15:17.113 --> 15:18.380
How'd it go?

15:18.448 --> 15:21.083
Judge is going to make a decision
at the end of the month.

15:22.453 --> 15:24.153
When you met with Carroll and Ruiz,

15:24.221 --> 15:25.531
did they tell you we
were being replaced?

15:25.555 --> 15:26.789
Yes.

15:26.857 --> 15:28.290
And you didn't think to call me?

15:28.358 --> 15:30.626
I planned on telling you in person.

15:30.694 --> 15:32.728
They want us to walk away.

15:32.796 --> 15:35.764
Yeah, well, I'm not built like that.

15:35.832 --> 15:38.118
I don't think you are, either.

15:38.685 --> 15:41.712
We've got a week left to
finish what we started here.

15:42.639 --> 15:44.573
Cory says he saw Arlen
kill Joey Campbell.

15:44.641 --> 15:46.241
I want to make sure
our witness is legit.

15:46.281 --> 15:47.343
Why wouldn't he be?

15:47.410 --> 15:49.178
Deputy Brooks told me
about an unrelated case

15:49.246 --> 15:51.647
where a witness lied for Pastor Janae.

15:51.715 --> 15:54.316
Want to make sure the same thing
isn't happening with Cory.

15:54.384 --> 15:57.386
So I'm thinking I'll
talk to him one-on-one.

15:57.454 --> 15:59.388
Makes sense.

15:59.456 --> 16:03.225
I'll get on my computer, start digging.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.232
Hey, Doreen.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.635
- Hey, Daniel... you wanted to talk?
- Yeah.

16:19.463 --> 16:21.525
- Here.
- That's okay.

16:26.349 --> 16:28.884
Robbie left me a message.

16:28.952 --> 16:32.054
Evidently he doesn't want me
to go to his academy graduation.

16:32.122 --> 16:35.624
What? Wait, he said that?

16:36.167 --> 16:39.104
He blames me for you and I splitting up.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.997
No, you're the reason he wanted
to be a cop in the first place.

16:42.065 --> 16:43.933
He's angry, but I'll talk to him.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.771
Maybe you could tell him that
you're the one that wanted out.

16:52.509 --> 16:53.842
Am I?

16:53.910 --> 16:56.412
Because we both agree

16:56.479 --> 16:58.247
that you're married to this job.

16:58.937 --> 17:01.377
I'm where you went when you
couldn't be with the one you love.

17:04.621 --> 17:07.000
He's being held for destruction
of city property,

17:07.055 --> 17:09.558
criminal mischief, and resisting arrest.

17:09.626 --> 17:11.426
His bond is set at $10,000.

17:11.493 --> 17:14.096
There ain't no way you could
just release him to me?

17:14.164 --> 17:15.564
I'll make sure he come to court.

17:15.632 --> 17:18.233
Bond or juvenile detention.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.102
You will not take my son away from me.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.203
Not this one.

17:21.271 --> 17:22.538
Next, please.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.740
No, ain't no next, ain't no next.
I got next.

17:24.808 --> 17:26.954
What if I shocked you

17:27.446 --> 17:29.846
and said I'd retire?

17:30.113 --> 17:31.280
For what?

17:31.525 --> 17:33.949
For us.

17:34.017 --> 17:37.620
For us not to sign the paper.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.462
Just give me one second.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.308
- But I'm not scared of you.
- You should probably go home

17:49.332 --> 17:50.676
before you get yourself in trouble.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.900
What more can you do to me?

17:53.339 --> 17:55.504
What's worse than what you already done?

17:55.548 --> 17:57.587
I am not leaving here without my son.

17:57.689 --> 18:00.243
His name's Shawn Marcellus Campbell.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.913
Ms. Campbell?

18:02.017 --> 18:04.913
May I speak with you, please, ma'am?

18:09.019 --> 18:10.352
Next, please.

18:13.356 --> 18:16.025
I can only imagine
what you've been through

18:16.092 --> 18:18.961
these past few weeks,
but your son, he helped

18:19.029 --> 18:21.529
destroy a police vehicle,
and he could have hurt

18:21.594 --> 18:23.482
one of my deputies.

18:24.267 --> 18:26.235
Hurt one of your deputies?

18:29.172 --> 18:32.641
Governor Eamons sat in my
living room, Sheriff Platt.

18:32.709 --> 18:35.210
Said if there was anything
she could ever do for me

18:35.278 --> 18:36.489
that I shouldn't hesitate to call.

18:36.513 --> 18:38.862
I've lost one son.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.901
I don't have it in me
to lose another one.

18:40.972 --> 18:41.917
And I think...

18:41.985 --> 18:46.386
I think there's enough attention
on your department right now

18:46.456 --> 18:48.324
without me bringing more.

18:56.499 --> 18:57.599
You all right?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.368
I'm fine, I'm fine, Mom.

19:01.838 --> 19:04.173
Have you lost your damn mind?

19:04.240 --> 19:05.317
What the hell were you thinking?

19:05.341 --> 19:06.619
Don't you know they
could have killed you?

19:06.643 --> 19:07.883
Does that mean anything to you?

19:07.944 --> 19:10.379
What difference does it make if
they kill me now or later?

19:10.447 --> 19:11.527
I'm done doing it your way.

19:11.555 --> 19:13.552
So you grown now, is that it?

19:16.920 --> 19:19.258
You have no idea what
it's like to be me.

19:20.062 --> 19:21.942
You don't even know
how it was for Joey, do you?

19:34.838 --> 19:36.650
I need you to be straight with me.

19:36.728 --> 19:38.314
- I will.
- Did you see Arlen Cox

19:38.381 --> 19:39.641
kill Joey Campbell,
or was that some story

19:39.665 --> 19:41.080
that Pastor Janae fed you?

19:41.119 --> 19:43.260
On my momma, I'd never lie
for Pastor Janae.

19:43.322 --> 19:47.583
Obstruction of justice will land you
in federal prison, Cory.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.028
You're telling me
you never met with her?

19:49.052 --> 19:50.529
She was trying to recruit me
for The Hands.

19:50.553 --> 19:53.589
I told her I wasn't with it,
and she left me alone after that.

19:53.656 --> 19:55.324
- And what about you?
- What about me?

19:55.391 --> 19:56.969
You lost your job
a couple months back, right?

19:56.993 --> 19:58.260
Chosen House been footing

19:58.328 --> 19:59.989
some of the bills for you,
maybe you felt indebted.

20:00.013 --> 20:01.714
Why are we even talking about this?

20:01.798 --> 20:03.109
Did you tell your boy to lie
and say it was Arlen?

20:03.133 --> 20:04.767
Man, hell no.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.468
My son is risking his life for this.

20:06.536 --> 20:07.893
He said what he saw.

20:08.025 --> 20:09.744
Now, that's why we don't
trust none of y'all.

20:09.768 --> 20:12.619
You got a eyewitness in front of you.
How many more do you need?

20:37.855 --> 20:39.935
<i>This is Ashe... leave it here.</i>

20:57.321 --> 20:58.454
Pres.

20:58.479 --> 20:59.646
Hey.

20:59.671 --> 21:00.999
What's up?

21:03.241 --> 21:05.294
- You busy?
- No, man.

21:05.361 --> 21:07.429
I'm just cooking,
watching some game film.

21:07.497 --> 21:08.897
You mean picking apart your plays?

21:08.965 --> 21:10.465
Yeah, something like that.

21:12.535 --> 21:16.238
Man, glad to see the money
hasn't gone to your head.

21:16.306 --> 21:19.107
Yeah, good looks, talent, maybe.

21:19.175 --> 21:21.577
But money?...nah.

21:23.109 --> 21:24.947
So, how's your partner?

21:25.014 --> 21:26.181
She back on her meds yet?

21:26.249 --> 21:27.916
Don't say that.

21:27.984 --> 21:30.085
Damn, baby bro, you hitting it?

21:30.153 --> 21:31.620
No.

21:31.688 --> 21:34.957
Good, 'cause she way too much
for you anyway.

21:38.828 --> 21:41.129
Look, I, um...

21:41.197 --> 21:42.798
I got a favor to ask you.

21:44.567 --> 21:45.868
What kind of favor?

21:45.935 --> 21:48.637
I need ten G's.

21:48.705 --> 21:51.306
Cash.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.177
I can't tell you what it's for,
and I have no idea

21:55.245 --> 21:57.137
if I'll be able to pay you back.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.871
But I need you to come through for me.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.108
Big face hundreds work?

22:33.240 --> 22:34.460
This customer service?

22:34.485 --> 22:36.943
<i>- Yes, ma'am. How can I help you?
- Good, 'cause I ordered a pair of shoes</i>

22:36.967 --> 22:38.712
that should have been
delivered here this morning.

22:38.736 --> 22:40.216
<i>Do you have the order number?</i>

22:40.281 --> 22:42.005
Wait, hold on a second.

22:48.505 --> 22:49.872
Who the hell are you?

22:49.949 --> 22:52.629
<i>I'm Shirlane Woods,
with the Gate Newspaper.</i>

22:52.738 --> 22:54.630
Can I have a few minutes
of your time, please?

22:54.655 --> 22:55.591
For what?

22:55.616 --> 22:57.315
Your account of what happened
to Joey Campbell.

22:57.339 --> 23:00.107
You got the wrong person.
I don't know anything about that boy.

23:01.343 --> 23:02.577
Still got amnesia?

23:04.046 --> 23:07.548
I know that you witnessed his murder.

23:07.795 --> 23:10.488
<i>I will give you $10,000 for the story.</i>

23:10.637 --> 23:11.786
<i>You have no idea</i>

23:11.853 --> 23:13.020
what you're asking me to do.

23:13.121 --> 23:14.722
Your name will never be mentioned.

23:14.790 --> 23:18.343
This is a one-time offer...
it expires when I walk away.

23:24.399 --> 23:26.100
Right here.

23:32.841 --> 23:34.675
Can you explain this to me?

23:34.743 --> 23:36.978
Why did a young man lie about witnessing

23:37.045 --> 23:38.679
a drug dealer murder someone?

23:41.316 --> 23:44.657
He recanted his testimony.
The report says he lied.

23:44.735 --> 23:46.754
I say he was intimidated.

23:46.822 --> 23:49.256
What was the nature
of your relationship?

23:49.324 --> 23:51.359
One of The Hands told me
that a kid who was trying

23:51.426 --> 23:52.793
to do the right thing was scared.

23:52.861 --> 23:55.763
We told him we could protect him.
He didn't agree.

23:55.831 --> 23:57.898
And how are you connected
to the drug dealer?

23:57.966 --> 23:59.444
I have no connections to drug dealers

23:59.468 --> 24:01.434
outside of getting them the hell
out of my community.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.037
By any means necessary?

24:05.700 --> 24:07.241
Anything else?

24:07.309 --> 24:09.377
Did you give Cory a
story about Arlen Cox

24:09.444 --> 24:10.611
shooting Joey Campbell?

24:12.014 --> 24:13.114
Why would I do that?

24:13.181 --> 24:15.716
Maybe you see his
new correctional facility

24:15.784 --> 24:16.984
as a threat to your community.

24:17.019 --> 24:18.986
Mr. Cox was good enough

24:19.054 --> 24:21.222
to take me to dinner a few nights ago.

24:21.289 --> 24:23.824
He encouraged me to join his board

24:23.892 --> 24:26.093
of directors and get a paid position

24:26.161 --> 24:28.940
so that I wouldn't speak out
against his prison.

24:29.354 --> 24:31.222
Needless to say, I declined.

24:32.868 --> 24:36.003
Maybe it's him who sees me as a threat.

24:36.071 --> 24:38.650
What the hell am I doing here?

24:39.119 --> 24:40.941
We have some questions
about Pastor Janae.

24:41.009 --> 24:43.310
Pastor Janae.

24:43.378 --> 24:48.315
Well, Pastor Janae's endgame

24:48.383 --> 24:50.451
is the same as any preacher

24:50.519 --> 24:54.789
who turns to being a
political pundit... money.

24:54.856 --> 24:56.023
How's that?

24:56.091 --> 24:57.925
I met with her the other night.

24:57.993 --> 25:00.895
I offered her a seat
on my board of directors,

25:00.962 --> 25:02.396
and she refused.

25:02.464 --> 25:04.632
Maybe she didn't want
to be in your pocket.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.277
Kind of hard to speak out
against injustice

25:06.301 --> 25:07.468
when you're on the payroll.

25:09.204 --> 25:14.909
After she declined, she
demanded a cash donation,

25:14.976 --> 25:17.378
which she called "reparation."

25:17.446 --> 25:20.481
And I refused.

25:20.549 --> 25:21.949
And how'd she take that?

25:22.017 --> 25:23.584
You'd have to ask her.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.412
Is it fair to say
you don't care much for her

25:25.454 --> 25:27.054
because she's a detractor?

25:27.122 --> 25:30.491
I'm the head of an
international conglomerate.

25:30.559 --> 25:31.959
Detractors come with the territory.

25:35.530 --> 25:37.610
Any one of your detractors
ever accuse you of murder?

25:38.967 --> 25:41.268
No.

25:41.336 --> 25:43.104
This interview is over.

25:46.408 --> 25:47.942
You know,

25:48.009 --> 25:50.945
when I first talked to
Sheriff Platt, I told him

25:51.012 --> 25:55.116
that I would be happy to assist
you in your investigation.

25:55.183 --> 25:58.953
However,

25:59.020 --> 26:00.755
I think I misjudged you.

26:02.791 --> 26:05.793
What I took as an intensity
for the truth

26:05.861 --> 26:07.695
turns out to be the desperation of a man

26:07.763 --> 26:09.463
who is in over his head.

26:09.531 --> 26:12.299
And after the recent events here,

26:12.367 --> 26:16.370
my town, and especially

26:16.438 --> 26:18.806
the families of those
two poor deceased boys,

26:18.874 --> 26:21.575
we deserve better.

26:21.643 --> 26:24.031
We have an eyewitness
that says they saw you

26:24.092 --> 26:25.953
murder Joey Campbell.

26:29.453 --> 26:33.621
Is it safe to assume
that if you had full confidence

26:33.688 --> 26:36.323
in this witness, that I wouldn't be

26:36.391 --> 26:41.629
walking out of this room
like I am right now?

26:51.072 --> 26:52.273
Hold up.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.841
Hold up!

26:53.909 --> 26:55.776
We got a week left,
and you're being soft?

26:55.844 --> 26:57.044
Soft?

26:57.112 --> 26:58.779
That was embarrassing.

26:58.847 --> 27:00.714
What'd you think he was gonna say?

27:00.782 --> 27:02.750
He's gonna use the information
you just gave him

27:02.818 --> 27:04.351
to insulate himself even more.

27:04.419 --> 27:06.086
Yeah, well, at least
I'm doing something.

27:06.154 --> 27:08.689
You haven't been focused since
you got off the damn plane.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.891
Don't question me.

27:10.959 --> 27:13.561
It's not just your name and
reputation on this thing.

27:20.468 --> 27:21.936
Preston Terry.

27:22.003 --> 27:24.289
Hey, it's Shirlane.
I just spoke to Kiana.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.525
Where are...

27:30.303 --> 27:31.919
I'm from the Department of Justice.

27:31.944 --> 27:34.546
I'm looking for Shirlane Woods...
car accident.

27:34.613 --> 27:36.447
She's being prepped for
emergency surgery.

27:36.533 --> 27:37.681
How bad is she hurt?

27:37.767 --> 27:39.384
Head trauma and internal bleeding.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.319
Her personal effects
are a part of an ongoing

27:41.387 --> 27:42.987
federal investigation... where are they?

28:06.345 --> 28:08.145
This would be more productive
if you'd tell me

28:08.180 --> 28:09.547
what we're looking for.

28:10.683 --> 28:14.118
No phone, no recorder, no notes.

28:15.854 --> 28:18.122
This wasn't an accident.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.796
The lieutenant governor can
attend the event in Wilmington.

28:24.863 --> 28:27.365
I suggest we videoconference
you in to make a brief statement.

28:27.433 --> 28:30.034
The donors will understand,
but it's a nice gesture.

28:30.102 --> 28:31.102
Okay, set it up.

28:33.238 --> 28:34.839
You finish your math?

28:34.907 --> 28:36.741
Doing chem now.

28:36.809 --> 28:38.509
I got invited to a pizza party tonight.

28:38.577 --> 28:40.812
On a school night? What's the occasion?

28:40.879 --> 28:42.900
My classmates are watching
for the riots,

28:42.970 --> 28:44.025
in case they start back up.

28:44.049 --> 28:45.883
For entertainment purposes?

28:45.951 --> 28:47.685
The young and entitled.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.989
Mom, did you really send in a tank?

28:51.056 --> 28:53.758
A tactical vehicle.

28:53.826 --> 28:55.909
And yes, we've dispatched
other departments to help

28:55.979 --> 28:57.307
maintain order as well.

28:57.377 --> 28:59.064
Hopefully, your friends won't
have too much of a party.

28:59.088 --> 29:00.268
They're not my friends.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.338
I'm one of the few kids
that thinks this is insane.

29:02.549 --> 29:04.335
Mom, you're literally
occupying a section

29:04.403 --> 29:06.971
of Gate Station that's populated
with poor people.

29:07.039 --> 29:10.519
Some of the people who are rioting
are not even from Gate Station.

29:11.276 --> 29:13.277
I'm trying to protect those poor people

29:13.345 --> 29:15.647
from a handful of troublemakers
who'd like to destroy

29:15.714 --> 29:17.448
all that community has.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.684
Well, it looks like
you're being a bully.

29:21.787 --> 29:23.955
I'm sure it does.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.057
Um...

29:26.125 --> 29:28.459
is this the worst time you've
ever had being governor?

29:33.966 --> 29:37.811
Your granddad used to stress
the importance of legacy...

29:38.048 --> 29:40.170
what will you leave behind?

29:41.366 --> 29:44.242
It's possible that all I've accomplished

29:44.309 --> 29:47.078
will be overshadowed by the
death of these two young men.

29:47.546 --> 29:50.415
Well, your legacy isn't just
about your job.

29:50.482 --> 29:54.018
I'm your legacy, too.
And you're a great mom.

30:07.399 --> 30:08.933
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on, come on,

30:09.001 --> 30:10.286
come on, come on, get off the couch.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.155
Acting like you ain't got
no home training.

30:12.248 --> 30:13.871
And pick up these toys like I said.

30:13.939 --> 30:16.040
Okay, all right, all right, stop.

30:16.108 --> 30:17.675
Look at me... do what Daddy told you.

30:17.743 --> 30:20.912
- I'm going to get you!
- Back up!

30:24.049 --> 30:25.750
Hey, listen, get up. What did I say?

30:25.818 --> 30:27.328
Didn't I tell you to stop? Look at this.

30:27.352 --> 30:28.752
What the hell is your damn problem?

30:28.787 --> 30:29.954
What's wrong with you, boy?

30:30.022 --> 30:32.457
What the hell are you doing?

30:32.524 --> 30:34.192
- It's okay.
- It is not okay.

30:34.259 --> 30:36.304
- These boys are going to listen to me.
- Not like that!

30:36.328 --> 30:38.239
You have a problem with the way
that I discipline my kids?

30:38.263 --> 30:41.099
Yeah, I do,

30:41.166 --> 30:42.567
when you're drinking

30:42.634 --> 30:44.179
in the middle of the day
and snatching them up.

30:44.203 --> 30:47.038
We are not that kind of family.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.540
My sons are not going to
disrespect me, and you are not

30:49.608 --> 30:51.375
going to undermine
my authority in my house.

30:51.443 --> 30:52.577
Authority?

30:53.149 --> 30:57.081
I'll follow when you are
capable of leading.

30:57.430 --> 31:01.368
Because right now, I don't know
who the hell you are.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.425
Where are you going?

31:07.493 --> 31:09.193
This way.

31:09.261 --> 31:10.595
Kerry!

31:11.115 --> 31:12.115
Kerry!

31:20.773 --> 31:22.907
Nobody was crying for me in The Houses.

31:22.975 --> 31:23.908
Six of us living

31:23.976 --> 31:25.409
in a two bedroom, one bath.

31:25.477 --> 31:27.756
And now that I'm trying
to do better for myself,

31:27.818 --> 31:29.170
y'all are up my ass.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.185
3K a month for rent and a brand new car.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.284
My new man got money.

31:33.352 --> 31:35.396
Whatever they're paying you to
keep quiet is the same thing

31:35.420 --> 31:37.021
they can pay to make you disappear.

31:37.089 --> 31:40.458
Anything you think I know
won't bring him back.

31:40.526 --> 31:42.293
Is it true what they say?

31:42.632 --> 31:44.218
Joey was calling for Shameeka?

31:44.288 --> 31:46.697
"Somebody call my moms,
somebody call my moms."

31:47.843 --> 31:51.302
Look, I'm out The Houses, and whatever
happens there ain't my business.

31:51.370 --> 31:54.305
There's a young woman in surgery
fighting for her life.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.073
There's a young man
in protective custody

31:56.141 --> 31:57.786
afraid for his, and then
there's Joey Campbell.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.243
It has nothing to do with me.

31:59.311 --> 32:00.671
Where's the 10K Shirlane gave you?

32:01.436 --> 32:05.186
I don't know what you talking about.
Nobody gave me any money.

32:05.264 --> 32:06.342
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

32:06.366 --> 32:07.785
No.

32:07.786 --> 32:09.353
What the hell are you doing?

32:09.421 --> 32:11.222
Where is it?

32:11.290 --> 32:13.257
Stop it!

32:13.325 --> 32:14.892
- Please, stop!
- Where is it?

32:14.960 --> 32:15.960
Preston!

32:29.641 --> 32:31.776
This is a waste of time.

32:31.844 --> 32:34.345
She doesn't know anything.

32:55.830 --> 32:59.486
A federal prosecutor bribing
a witness gets you disbarred

32:59.511 --> 33:01.080
and a six-by-nine in Leavenworth.

33:01.143 --> 33:02.445
I'd prefer not to join you.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.181
Join me?

33:04.249 --> 33:05.612
I got the idea from you.

33:05.675 --> 33:07.952
Getting info isn't always
fresh and clean, remember?

33:08.019 --> 33:10.087
You've got to know the rules
in order to break them.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.922
You should have given me a heads-up.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.693
You checked out on me.

33:17.697 --> 33:19.853
Feel like I'm all on my own in this.

33:19.939 --> 33:21.291
Now you know how I feel.

33:21.369 --> 33:23.968
I've been carrying your ass
since you got to Gate Station.

33:24.042 --> 33:25.797
Carrying me? I don't think so.

33:25.868 --> 33:27.604
But you did get me to trust you.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.440
And now we're being sent home.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.108
What if there's nothing here?

33:31.176 --> 33:33.110
Ever think of that?

33:33.178 --> 33:35.145
What if Jesse did go for Beck's gun?

33:35.213 --> 33:36.981
If it weren't for that "cracker" video

33:37.048 --> 33:39.483
blowing up, we'd
probably be home by now.

33:39.551 --> 33:43.320
Kiana never told us what she saw.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.090
And I'm willing to bet
that she saw Arlen kill Joey

33:46.157 --> 33:47.491
just like Cory did.

33:47.559 --> 33:48.669
We're supposed to ignore that?

33:48.693 --> 33:51.729
Kiana's in the wind.

33:51.796 --> 33:53.831
Let the new team coming in
worry about her.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.503
- So you just want us to cut our losses?
- Yep.

34:00.805 --> 34:05.075
Fine, yeah, let's do that.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.544
As soon as you tell me what the
hell happened to my partner.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.556
You want to see me, boss?

34:20.625 --> 34:22.793
Sit down.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.232
How was your car ride
with Eamons yesterday?

34:28.299 --> 34:30.400
Awkward.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.137
Not someplace I ever expected to be.

34:33.204 --> 34:36.407
Well, I'm sure it was intoxicating.

34:36.893 --> 34:38.885
Not for me, sir.

34:40.799 --> 34:42.446
She asked about The Tours.

34:45.315 --> 34:46.984
What'd you say?

34:47.052 --> 34:49.286
I said that if I ever felt
there was something wrong,

34:49.353 --> 34:51.188
I would have come straight to you.

34:55.326 --> 34:58.529
All the fancy dinners,

34:58.596 --> 35:02.399
small talk with the bigwigs,

35:02.467 --> 35:04.101
it's not a world
you'd be comfortable in.

35:06.574 --> 35:08.170
Besides,

35:08.772 --> 35:11.272
under the gaze of the spotlight,

35:12.010 --> 35:14.845
the real you eventually comes out.

35:31.496 --> 35:35.532
<i>Attention! Those of you standing
in the middle of the street,</i>

35:35.600 --> 35:37.201
<i>you are unlawfully assembled.</i>

35:37.268 --> 35:39.736
We can't even bring
our babies out here, right?

35:39.821 --> 35:42.539
They got the police down here
like we criminals, right?

35:42.607 --> 35:44.307
Get your people down here!

35:44.476 --> 35:46.543
Get your people down here!

35:46.611 --> 35:47.825
Come on!

35:47.911 --> 35:49.947
Tell your people to come down here!

35:50.014 --> 35:51.748
Joey was the last one.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.717
It ain't going down like that no more!

35:53.785 --> 35:55.219
<i>For your own safety,</i>

35:55.286 --> 35:56.920
<i>disperse and return</i>

35:56.979 --> 35:58.468
to your homes immediately.

35:58.492 --> 36:00.782
We ain't going nowhere!
We ain't going nowhere!

36:00.807 --> 36:03.827
<i>Disperse and return
to your homes immediately!</i>

36:03.895 --> 36:04.828
I ain't going nowhere!

36:04.896 --> 36:05.896
- Hey!
- I live here!

36:05.964 --> 36:08.665
You go home, crooked-ass cop!

36:08.733 --> 36:10.044
What you going to do, you going
to take us all to jail?

36:10.068 --> 36:11.235
Take me first.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.003
And I promise you on everything I love,

36:13.071 --> 36:14.315
I'm gonna make it hurt. Let's go!

36:14.339 --> 36:15.506
<i>Ready the line!</i>

36:17.275 --> 36:19.276
He's with the DOJ... give him a minute.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.055
You want to give them a
reason to beat you down?

36:21.079 --> 36:22.713
Arrest you in the middle of the street?

36:22.780 --> 36:24.114
And then what?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.171
Bro, don't even come at me with that.
I know who you are.

36:26.195 --> 36:27.955
You ain't nothing but
the white man's puppet.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.564
You want to give them
an excuse to hurt you,

36:30.588 --> 36:31.788
then that's on you.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.799
But I'm telling you
right now, man to man...

36:35.075 --> 36:36.970
I'm telling all of you...

36:37.119 --> 36:39.429
I'm going to find out
who killed Joey Campbell.

36:39.497 --> 36:41.965
Yeah, right. Come on.

36:42.033 --> 36:45.202
And I'm going to find out
what happened to Jesse.

36:45.270 --> 36:48.305
And once the truth is out there
for everyone to see,

36:48.373 --> 36:50.040
we can change things.

36:51.351 --> 36:53.644
This town, this legacy

36:53.711 --> 36:57.648
of racism that you're saying
no to, I'm also saying no.

37:01.286 --> 37:04.521
I promise you, I'm going to fix this.

37:07.344 --> 37:09.410
I swear to you all.

37:10.828 --> 37:13.567
Maybe I came to Gate Station
as a puppet...

37:15.137 --> 37:17.834
but I'm not leaving as one.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.042
It's on you, then.

37:30.104 --> 37:32.182
Let's see if you're
gonna do what you say.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.717
We'll see.

37:51.402 --> 37:53.503
What happens if you can't
deliver on your promise?

37:55.306 --> 37:57.474
Our promise.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.121
<i>The hell are you doing?
Turn that thing off, damn it!</i>

38:06.146 --> 38:09.301
Yo, your pops is a real badass.

38:09.379 --> 38:12.383
- Yeah, he has his moments.
- This is crazy.

38:12.451 --> 38:14.118
We're looking like Ferguson.

38:17.451 --> 38:20.843
For real, Dad, I knock on your
door before I come barging in.

38:20.929 --> 38:22.382
It's called privacy.

38:22.428 --> 38:24.218
Your door is attached to my house.

38:24.289 --> 38:25.859
What, you think we're making out in here

38:25.883 --> 38:27.665
with Mom ten feet away in the kitchen?

38:27.733 --> 38:29.203
Were you?

38:29.289 --> 38:32.506
Whoa, Coach B, I would never
come at Tess like that.

38:32.583 --> 38:33.917
Y'all are like family.

38:33.990 --> 38:35.772
We were just watching
your video on YouTube.

38:35.863 --> 38:37.531
You're a hero.

38:37.676 --> 38:40.078
I'm not a hero, Tommy,
I'm just doing my damn job.

38:40.145 --> 38:41.713
You are a hero, Dad.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.082
Doesn't matter what your job is.

38:44.149 --> 38:45.917
So just get used to it, okay?

38:49.788 --> 38:50.822
Leave the door open.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.161
We live to do what we love,
no matter the danger,

38:57.229 --> 38:58.730
wherever it takes us.

39:00.399 --> 39:02.302
All right, let's go, guys...
another rally at the mural.

39:02.326 --> 39:04.636
Make sure any pics or videos
are saved in the vault app.

39:09.308 --> 39:11.209
It's a long shot...

39:11.277 --> 39:13.478
We've already been through
his personal computer

39:13.546 --> 39:15.046
and all the media on his cell phone.

39:16.172 --> 39:18.186
Maybe not all of it.

39:18.459 --> 39:19.717
That doc crew on the street

39:19.785 --> 39:22.820
had their phones automatically
set up to hide media

39:22.888 --> 39:24.266
from the police or anyone
they think might want

39:24.290 --> 39:26.658
to confiscate their footage.

39:26.725 --> 39:28.059
Same thing teens do

39:28.127 --> 39:30.762
to hide sexting and pics
from their parents.

39:30.829 --> 39:33.598
It could be in the calendar app
or calculator.

39:42.308 --> 39:44.008
<i>Great, po-po.</i>

39:44.076 --> 39:45.543
My God.

39:46.745 --> 39:48.079
This is it.

39:51.784 --> 39:53.284
<i>Check this out.</i>

40:02.027 --> 40:04.596
<i>- You lost, boy?
- No, sir.</i>

40:04.663 --> 40:06.007
<i>What are you doing in this neighborhood?</i>

40:06.031 --> 40:07.765
<i>Why did you pull me over?</i>

40:07.833 --> 40:09.634
<i>Because you don't look right.</i>

40:09.702 --> 40:12.176
<i>I didn't realize it was illegal
to be in this part of town.</i>

40:12.242 --> 40:14.293
<i>Depends on what you're doing here.</i>

40:14.755 --> 40:16.824
<i>I came for some fried chicken.</i>

40:18.387 --> 40:20.044
<i>License and registration.</i>

40:20.112 --> 40:21.235
<i>What... I didn't do anything.</i>

40:21.259 --> 40:23.615
<i>License and registration now.</i>

40:28.218 --> 40:29.587
<i>- Get out.
- I'm sorry.</i>

40:29.655 --> 40:31.129
<i>I'm sorry, all right?</i>

40:31.184 --> 40:33.257
<i>Get out of the car!</i>

40:39.999 --> 40:40.918
<i>What... I didn't do anything.</i>

40:40.981 --> 40:43.205
<i>License and registration now.</i>

40:45.537 --> 40:47.605
<i>- Get out.
- I'm sorry.</i>

40:47.673 --> 40:50.274
<i>- I'm sorry, all right?
- Get out of the car!</i>

40:53.178 --> 40:55.747
What this proves is that
Beck was having a bad day.

40:55.814 --> 40:57.081
It doesn't make him a murderer.

40:57.149 --> 40:58.716
It makes him a liar.

40:58.784 --> 41:01.919
He pulled Jesse's door open,
which is a pretty glaring detail

41:01.987 --> 41:03.788
he neglected to include
in his statement.

41:03.856 --> 41:06.257
We're gonna need him
back in the box ASAP.

41:06.325 --> 41:08.236
And while we're at it,
we have some follow-up questions

41:08.260 --> 41:10.361
for you and your deputies
regarding The Tours.

41:10.429 --> 41:13.097
I heard this was your last week.
Going out with a bang?

41:13.165 --> 41:14.298
Might as well.

41:14.941 --> 41:18.207
<i>Gate Station Command,
Gate Station Command, over.</i>

41:18.356 --> 41:20.138
Gate Station, go ahead.

41:20.205 --> 41:21.873
<i>The warrants have been signed, Sheriff,</i>

41:21.940 --> 41:23.500
<i>and the units are moving into position.</i>

41:24.114 --> 41:26.244
Copy that, show me en route.

41:28.278 --> 41:30.748
Well, since you're on a roll,

41:30.997 --> 41:33.443
I think the two of you
should come with me.

42:35.776 --> 42:38.604
Why am I not surprised
to see you here, Brother Terry?

42:39.118 --> 42:41.052
You're letting them
make a fool out of you.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.787
What did she do, man?

42:44.556 --> 42:47.725
We were tipped off about the weapon.

42:47.793 --> 42:50.027
She's being charged with
the murder of Joey Campbell.
