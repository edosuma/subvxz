WEBVTT

00:16.080 --> 00:17.445
GIRL:
God, I thought it was you.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.210
I heard "Grace"
and I was like, "Oh, God."

00:20.250 --> 00:22.047
Did you know her?

00:22.090 --> 00:25.309
No. 1-1 mean, a little.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.159
What happened?

00:27.190 --> 00:30.284
Portia said she took a handful
of her mom's sleeping pills.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.251
No, she did it at the hotel

00:31.290 --> 00:33.190
where she was supposed
to go for the prom.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.458
Why?
I think her
boyfriend

00:34.500 --> 00:35.694
broke up with her
or something.

00:35.730 --> 00:36.765
They said she was
in her underwear.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.789
Hannah just tweeted

00:37.830 --> 00:39.468
it was aspirin, not painkillers.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.365
_ GIRL 2: _
DId you guys see Connor Just

00:41.400 --> 00:44.369
checked in on Foursquare, like,
an hour ago? At the library.

00:44.410 --> 00:45.809
What are you doing
at the library

00:45.840 --> 00:47.330
the day after your girlfriend
kills herself?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.245
Ex-girlfriend.
They broke up last week.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.702
Did you see he changed
his status to "single"?
I know.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.718
She tweeted a picture
of herself last week

00:52.750 --> 00:54.274
after she dyed her hair red--
#YOLO.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.742
GIRL 1:
Yeah, "you only live once."

00:55.780 --> 00:57.839
GIRL 2:
She sat two rows behind
me in algebra last year.

00:57.890 --> 00:58.845
GIRL 3:
I know it's kind of morbid,

00:58.890 --> 01:00.778
but I can't stop looking
at her Facebook page.

01:00.820 --> 01:04.256
(girls' conversations
overlapping)

01:04.290 --> 01:06.155
WOMAN:
And who is this?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.349
MAN:
Mr. Van Zanten.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.799
And you shot him
four times in the head?

01:08.830 --> 01:09.592
Yes.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.427
Why would you do that,
Mr. Yates?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.358
Because she wanted me to.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.288
You're referring
to the accused,

01:15.340 --> 01:16.864
Gwyneth Van Zanten?
Yes.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.866
You were her Pilates instructor?
Yes, but she said

01:18.910 --> 01:20.730
she loved me.
If I shot her husband...

01:20.780 --> 01:22.407
we would be together.

01:22.450 --> 01:22.939
With his money?

01:22.980 --> 01:24.242
Objection. Leading.

01:24.280 --> 01:24.746
(Creary sighs
heavily)

01:25.780 --> 01:27.145
Sustained.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.818
And you...

01:28.850 --> 01:30.283
Strike that.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.824
Why did M-Mrs. Van Zanten
want you to shoot her husband?

01:39.860 --> 01:40.827
WILL:
Objection.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.361
Ambiguous.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.561
Unfortunately, sustained.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.701
O-One second.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.836
Oh, did the
accused offer you

01:54.880 --> 01:57.303
anything in exchange
for this murder?

01:57.350 --> 01:59.341
YATES:
Yes, she said we'd
split his money.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.472
And did Mrs. Van Zanten explain

02:00.520 --> 02:02.181
why she wanted
her husband killed?

02:02.220 --> 02:03.812
He's a rich CEO.
They had a prenup.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.408
If she divorced him,
she got nothing.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.417
But if he died,

02:06.460 --> 02:07.586
she got everything.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.451
I see. And what happened

02:09.490 --> 02:10.627
after the murder?
WILL:
Objection.

02:10.660 --> 02:11.922
Calls for narrative.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.291
CREARY:
Ms. Hellinger,

02:13.330 --> 02:15.753
you are now experiencing
ASA Hazing 101.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.324
Sustained.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.190
HELLINGER:
Thank you, Your Honor.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.336
Did you text the accused
after the murder?

02:22.370 --> 02:24.304
I did.
And what did your text say?

02:24.340 --> 02:25.807
"It's done.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.479
"Our problems are over.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.478
Don't go home until 8:00."

02:30.510 --> 02:31.579
Why not go home until 8:00?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.919
To establish her alibi.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.918
MAN:
Hello, this is the principal
at Capstone Preparatory.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.588
Over the weekend,
there was a tragic incident

02:37.620 --> 02:39.178
involving a Capstone student.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.188
Please take a moment
to discuss this...

02:41.220 --> 02:43.256
(beep)

02:43.290 --> 02:44.655
HELLINGER:
Hey.

02:44.690 --> 02:45.918
Hi.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.450
A bit more rough and tumble
than military court.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.468
You'll be fine.
Just don't retreat.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.422
You're either advancing
or retreating.

02:51.470 --> 02:52.539
GRACE: Hi, Mom.
(whispering): My daughter.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.231
No, thanks.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.294
Grace.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.205
Uh, hi. What's going on?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.208
I just got a call from school.
Oh, yeah.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.470
Grace Baskin OD'd on pills.

03:01.510 --> 03:03.273
Oh, my God. When?

03:03.310 --> 03:04.379
Last night.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.809
We're all wearing yellow today.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.477
It was her favorite color.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.669
What happened?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.347
Hey, Mom, I have
to get to class.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.812
Can I call you back?
Are you all right?

03:11.850 --> 03:14.284
Yeah, I mean, it's sad,
but I'm good.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.527
I'll call you back, okay?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.380
It's his fault.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.398
I didn't even think
he'd show up at school.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.658
And, look, he didn't
wear yellow.
I heard

03:21.700 --> 03:22.860
he told her_to
get an abortion.

03:22.900 --> 03:23.867
No, he didn't.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.265
She wasn't
even pregnant.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.733
Yeah, who told you
she got an abortion?

03:26.770 --> 03:28.431
I don't know. Someone
re-tweeted it.

03:28.470 --> 03:29.368
Is that even his car?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.968
I thought he was
a scholarship kid.
He is.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.568
I've seen him
on the bus.

03:32.610 --> 03:34.407
Do you think
he blames himself?

03:34.440 --> 03:36.647
Wouldn't you?
He breaks up with her,

03:36.680 --> 03:38.272
then four days later,
she kills herself.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.846
I know.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.019
Can you imagine?

03:42.050 --> 03:44.484
WILL:
My client has stated that she
was faithful to her late husband

03:44.520 --> 03:46.010
and that they were
happily married.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.984
Yet you claim she was having
an affair with you?

03:48.020 --> 03:50.420
Yes.
Do you have
any proof of this?

03:50.460 --> 03:51.825
Any love letters? Any...

03:51.860 --> 03:54.397
mementos of this...

03:54.430 --> 03:55.727
torrid affair?

03:55.760 --> 03:57.523
No.
I see.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.868
So we're to take
your word for It?

03:59.900 --> 04:02.960
And this text you sent her--
that it was "done"--

04:03.010 --> 04:04.329
what did she write back?

04:04.370 --> 04:06.429
She didn't.
We talked in person.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.277
Ah. So...

04:08.310 --> 04:09.402
you admitted
killing her husband,

04:09.450 --> 04:12.419
you admitted sending her a
text admitting your guilt,

04:12.450 --> 04:14.475
and my client hasn't
admitted a thing?

04:14.520 --> 04:15.475
(clears throat)

04:15.520 --> 04:18.011
Objection, Your Honor,
counsel is testifying.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.586
Yes, he is that.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.349
Sustained.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.948
After you sent this text,

04:25.830 --> 04:26.797
didn't she?
Objection,

04:26.830 --> 04:28.491
Your Honor.
Counsel IS still

04:28.530 --> 04:29.690
testifying.
Not only that,

04:29.730 --> 04:31.766
he's asking
for hearsay.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.836
It goes to the defendant's
state of mind, Your Honor.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.497
Actually, no.
Mr. Gardner is asking

04:35.540 --> 04:37.007
for the content
of a conversation

04:37.040 --> 04:39.634
between M_rs. Van Zanten
and a police detective.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.499
If that's what he wants,

04:40.540 --> 04:42.076
he should put one of them
on the stand.

04:42.110 --> 04:43.600
Oh, she's got you
there, Mr. Gardner.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.345
Congratulations, Ms. Hellinger.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.571
Hmm.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.481
What were you offered in trade

04:56.530 --> 04:58.384
for your testimony here,
Mr. Yates?

04:58.430 --> 05:00.421
Well, I wouldn't say
it was a trade.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.462
I received a plea bargain.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.467
And what was the plea bargain?

05:03.500 --> 05:04.762
20 years.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.892
For cold-blooded murder?

05:05.930 --> 05:07.568
Objection, Your Honor.
Argumentative.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.862
Yes. Sustained.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.378
And what is the usual sentence

05:12.410 --> 05:13.900
for first-degree murder?
Objection, Your Honor.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.077
Calls for speculation.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.646
Yes. Sustained.

05:18.980 --> 05:22.746
A murder like this usually
draws a 45-year sentence...
Objection.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.644
Counsel is testifying.

05:24.690 --> 05:25.918
Sustained again.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.555
Are you having trouble getting
out what you want, Mr. Gardner?

05:28.590 --> 05:30.683
(laughter)

05:34.700 --> 05:36.998
Nicely played.

05:37.030 --> 05:38.520
Thank you.

05:38.570 --> 05:39.559
We used to represent you.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.965
Yep.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.002
Thank you.

05:45.810 --> 05:48.108
(soft jazz playing)

05:48.140 --> 05:49.641
(exhales)

05:49.680 --> 05:51.477
Go well in court?

05:51.510 --> 05:54.445
Everybody feels bad
for the underdog.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.914
What about the person
who's supposed to do well?

05:56.950 --> 05:59.612
No one talks about the
pressure we're under.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.649
(chuckles)

06:00.690 --> 06:02.624
(laughs)

06:02.660 --> 06:04.525
So, what's
up with you?

06:04.560 --> 06:07.449
You've been
away from work.
No.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.718
Mentally, you have.
What's going on?

06:09.770 --> 06:12.568
Oh, just, uh,
personal stuff.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.660
Uninteresting.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.702
Huh. Judge Creary.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.905
What are you doing?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.703
Going to the restroom.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.877
Look, Creary plays by the book.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.070
Then he doesn't
have to talk.

06:26.110 --> 06:26.872
Kalinda, this
single case

06:26.920 --> 06:28.547
could drag us
out of bankruptcy.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.639
I want to get a sense
of where we stand.

06:36.590 --> 06:39.593
Oh, Will Gardner!
How the hell are you?

06:39.630 --> 06:40.892
Judge Creary.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.898
No, uh, no, I'll
call you right back.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.661
Will, hello.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.464
Giada, I... I didn't
know you were in town.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.568
Yeah, Orren & Polk,
second year.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.579
His Honor was just offering
me some career advice.

06:53.610 --> 06:56.033
Do you know this bastard?
I do. We met
when I was

06:56.080 --> 06:57.502
at DePaul, although
we haven't spoken

06:57.550 --> 06:58.744
in a while.
What happened there?

06:58.780 --> 07:01.715
I don't know,
I thought it was you.
Oh, no, it wasn't me.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.580
Yeah, well,
I'd stay away from him.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.212
He's a bad influence.
Oh, I knew that.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.855
Will is a bad boy.
Disbarred
bad boy.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.209
Six-months-
suspended bad boy.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.057
You _should've seen him
in court today.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.888
(laughing):
He was completely screwed up.

07:12.930 --> 07:16.058
Really? I... thought we
more than held our own.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.160
Mm-mm. No, you're gone,
you're-you're cooked,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.668
you're... deep-fried cooked.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.907
Why is that?
Your client--
she's guilty.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.032
How do you figure,
Your Honor?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.207
Actus reus.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.708
You're trying to make
her out to be a saint.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.970
She was cheating
on her husband.
No, I'm sorry,

07:31.010 --> 07:33.740
Your Honor, that's
just not true.
I can't for
the life of me

07:33.780 --> 07:35.873
figure why you
wanted a bench trial.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.980
Except you'd probably
do worse with a jury.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.954
His client is an ice queen.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.787
Looks something like this.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.821
I mean it.
Your Honor, if
you believe that,

07:44.860 --> 07:46.020
you need to recuse yourself.
Ooh!

07:46.060 --> 07:48.756
I love this one!
With his ethics!

07:48.800 --> 07:51.166
Love the ethics, Will.
(chuckling)

07:51.200 --> 07:53.236
Great for a disbarred lawyer.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.865
Mm. Bribing judges and stealing.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.901
You know, if it was up to me,

07:58.940 --> 08:01.932
you wouldn't be allowed
to practice law ever again.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.699
Maybe the thing is
to agree to disagree.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.638
Yeah. Yeah.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.683
I'm sorry, young lady...
for bringing my work here.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.711
Yep.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.514
He didn't say that?
He said I bribed
judges and stole,

08:14.560 --> 08:16.949
our client is guilty,
and I_ should never
practice law again.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.685
Well, he was drinking.

08:18.730 --> 08:19.651
Which means he's only being
more loose-lipped about

08:19.700 --> 08:20.849
with what he really thinks.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.198
Damn it.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.289
Gwyn brings her husband's
fortune to us,

08:26.330 --> 08:28.161
it gets us out of debt.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.736
I know, and it's a good case.

08:29.770 --> 08:30.566
In front of another judge,
we'd win.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.005
What are you thinking,
the same thing?

08:34.040 --> 08:35.678
Move for a recusal?

08:35.710 --> 08:38.975
He says no, you've turned
the judge against you.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.546
He's against me already.

08:40.580 --> 08:43.788
There will be fallout
from the judicial community.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.139
Creary is beloved.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.316
He was beloved.

08:46.350 --> 08:47.419
Judges know he's a loose cannon.

08:47.460 --> 08:53.228
We win this case, we get out
from under the trustee.

08:53.260 --> 08:56.024
We could get
the 27th floor back.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.824
Have Cary argue the
motion for you.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.337
No, Alicia.

09:00.370 --> 09:01.837
Will...
It's not that.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.701
I think Creary's got a thing
for the ladies.

09:03.740 --> 09:06.607
Oh. Well, don't embarrass him.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.074
Ask for the conference
in chambers.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.873
Have Alicia move for
the recusal there.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.070
And if he says no?

09:16.750 --> 09:19.048
This should be
interesting.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.854
Probably too late
to take my advice back.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.687
Probably.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.764
Your Honor,
the defense requests

09:31.800 --> 09:33.290
an issues conference
in chambers.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.093
What do you need, Counselor?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.107
We have a motion,
Your Honor.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.802
But it would be easier
to present it in chambers.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.831
Oh? And why is that?

09:41.880 --> 09:42.972
Mr. Gardner?

09:43.010 --> 09:44.773
It's a personal matter,
Your Honor.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.675
Oh, really, a personal matter?

09:46.720 --> 09:47.846
What kind of personal matter?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.017
Please, Your Honor.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.938
Well, in chambers it'll be
on the record, Mr. Gardner,

09:50.990 --> 09:52.617
and-and...?

09:52.660 --> 09:53.854
Alicia Florrick.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.687
Ah, the state's attorney's wife.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.119
Very fortuitous.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.185
In there and in here,
it'll be on the record,

09:59.230 --> 10:01.824
so if you have a motion,
let's hear it.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.861
(clears throat)

10:07.900 --> 10:09.902
Your Honor, we move
that you recuse yourself.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.879
Oh, really?

10:13.910 --> 10:16.799
Now, why should I recuse myself?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.148
You have demonstrated bias
against the defense.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.317
(scoffs)

10:20.350 --> 10:21.817
Still licking your wounds

10:21.850 --> 10:24.910
about those objections
yesterday, Mr. Gardner?

10:24.950 --> 10:26.144
ALICIA:
No, Your Honor, this is
regarding the biased comments

10:26.190 --> 10:29.728
you made to Mr. Gardner in the
bar, The Arena, last night.

10:31.890 --> 10:35.189
This is dangerous territory,
Mrs. Florrick.

10:35.230 --> 10:38.290
You called our client guilty,

10:38.330 --> 10:41.060
and you said that Mr. Gardner
was a known liar,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.705
and that he should give up now
because he would lose.

10:43.740 --> 10:46.208
Well, your motion
is denied.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.879
You have any further witnesses?

10:48.910 --> 10:51.174
Your Honor, you showed bias
against us.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.144
I have ruled on your motion,
Mrs. Florrick.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.341
You may sit down now
unless you have another

10:55.380 --> 10:56.938
witness.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.319
You've given us no alternative,
Your Honor,

11:06.360 --> 11:09.454
but to file a motion to
substitute Your Honor for cause.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.468
You what?!

11:11.500 --> 11:14.162
We are filing
for a substitution hearing.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.259
Now, you sit down right now,
Mrs. Florrick.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.904
I have ruled!

11:17.940 --> 11:19.259
And it is not up to you...

11:19.310 --> 11:20.709
No, sir, it is not up to you.

11:20.740 --> 11:21.900
You have no further witnesses,

11:21.940 --> 11:23.168
then we will move toward...

11:23.210 --> 11:24.347
Excuse me,
Your Honor.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.347
It is our right.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.745
No, it is not your right

11:26.780 --> 11:27.940
to disrupt my court.

11:27.980 --> 11:28.947
You're in contempt.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.141
IfI make a motion
to substitute, Your Honor,

11:31.190 --> 11:33.852
then it is no longer
in your hands, and you must

11:33.890 --> 11:35.915
transfer this_matter
to another judge.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.928
You don't_ know
what you've just done.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.120
We do, Your Honor,

11:39.160 --> 11:41.048
but you've given us
no other choice.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.125
Everybody has a choice.
Everybody.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.867
You're fishing for a mistrial
here, and you won't get it.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.765
You lose this motion,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.064
and I'll be right back here
to judge this case.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.361
We understand that.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.037
So I'll give you one last chance

11:54.080 --> 11:55.331
to step back over that line.

11:57.010 --> 12:01.014
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but my motion has been made.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.984
We move for a hearing
into your bias

12:03.020 --> 12:05.147
against Mr. Gardner
and our client.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.277
We've been ten
percent more successful

12:32.310 --> 12:33.242
in optimizing campaign page
keywords, and that's resulted

12:33.280 --> 12:37.148
in a 20% increase in
organic search traffic.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.317
We've been employing the BLUF
tactic of networking design.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.159
That's Bottom
Line Up Front.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.021
I would say this met
with mixed results.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.880
Wait. There's been a 20% jump
in fund-raising?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.056
How did that happen?

12:46.090 --> 12:47.853
Uh, I.T.'s been
better managed.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.061
By who?
One of the
volunteers.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.419
Hire him.
Her.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.961
Do I care?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.991
(loud, overlapping chatter,
phones ringing)

12:58.410 --> 12:59.832
You're hired.
What?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.871
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.510
Good job, you guys, I'll need
you to stay a little later.

13:07.550 --> 13:08.517
You got it.
No problem.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.541
Where are you going, Jay?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.285
Uh, I have to
get back home.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.981
Okay. Tomorrow.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.511
IfI can.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.551
MAN: All _stand._
Court is now in sessmn.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.229
The Honorable
Peter Dunaway presiding.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.557
Uh-oh.
What?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.295
It's Judge Dunaway.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.969
This is a hearing to determine
whether Judge Harrison Creary

13:27.000 --> 13:29.969
is prejudiced against the
defendant and defense counsel...

13:31.910 --> 13:34.538
...in People v.
Gwyneth Van Zanten.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.172
ASA Hellinger,

13:36.210 --> 13:38.178
do you support Mr. Gardner's
motion to substitute?

13:38.210 --> 13:39.177
No, Your Honor.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.142
The People do not believe

13:40.180 --> 13:42.319
Judge Creary has shown bias
mmsmm.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.489
Then you will present
the evidence against prejudice,

13:44.520 --> 13:45.487
Mr. Gardner's
representative

13:45.520 --> 13:46.589
will present the
evidence for it.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.349
This hearing is, in effect,

13:48.390 --> 13:50.950
a trial within a trial...

13:53.630 --> 13:55.848
(clears throat)
Your Honor Creary, you
don't need to be present

13:55.900 --> 13:57.424
at this hearing.
Are you here to testify?

13:57.470 --> 13:58.596
Uh, no, Your Honor.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.598
I don't want to give this...

14:00.640 --> 14:03.632
mini-persecution any more
attention than it needs.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.069
But I do want
to face my accusers.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.509
Well, that is your
right, Your Honor.

14:06.540 --> 14:10.271
Uh, Judge Creary's prejudice
will be this hearing's

14:10.310 --> 14:12.949
one and only issue, rules
of evidence will apply,

14:12.980 --> 14:14.572
and my ruling will be final.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.247
Is that understood
by all counselors?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.588
COUNSELORS:
Yes, Your Honor.
Good.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.087
Then we will begin.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.111
(school bell ringing,
indistinct chatter)

14:43.510 --> 14:45.501
Hi.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.041
I'm Grace.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.608
Uh, sorry.

14:52.650 --> 14:55.414
Uh, that's my real name.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.280
Grace Florrick.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.390
I'm really sorry
about the other Grace.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.489
What do you want?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.924
Why aren't you in class?

15:05.970 --> 15:07.335
Why aren't you?

15:07.370 --> 15:09.190
'Cause I saw you come in here.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.201
Look, I don't need
anything, okay?

15:12.240 --> 15:16.176
We broke up. It
was a while ago.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.575
She didn't do it
'cause of me.

15:17.610 --> 15:20.147
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.945
(sighs)

15:25.990 --> 15:27.014
_ _You're the
politICIan's daughter,

15:27.060 --> 15:29.016
the one caught
with a hooker?

15:29.060 --> 15:30.288
He wasn't caught
with a hooker.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.218
WOMAN: Class is in session.
Who's in there?

15:33.730 --> 15:35.152
Shh.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.624
Come out now.
Right now!

15:38.670 --> 15:40.331
If you don't want
to get in trouble,

15:40.370 --> 15:41.997
come out right
this minute!

15:42.040 --> 15:43.462
(whispering):
They can't find us here.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.501
I see you in there.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.189
Do you need me to
deal with this, huh?

16:01.220 --> 16:02.448
(laughter)

16:02.490 --> 16:04.082
All right.
All right, bye.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.031
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. Saverese.

16:14.070 --> 16:16.334
Hey, no problem.

16:16.370 --> 16:17.769
About your losing
tow truck bid--

16:17.810 --> 16:19.766
we can't sue Strickler
Automotive, but we can appeal

16:19.810 --> 16:20.731
on the basis
of fraud.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.202
But just to
warn you,

16:22.240 --> 16:24.105
they're probably going
to say you cheated, too.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.038
Well, I thought
your company was protecting me

16:26.080 --> 16:27.012
against all that crap.

16:27.050 --> 16:28.210
CARY:
Yeah.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.012
Unfortunately,

16:29.050 --> 16:31.348
Strickler's proven
quite litigious.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.381
Now, there's a chance we
may end up in deposition,

16:33.420 --> 16:35.285
so I have to ask you
a few questions.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.288
You were convicted
on a drug charge.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.254
Cocaine. Intent to sell.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.757
And how many years
were you in?
Two.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.529
It was Canadians.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.367
You know,
they've got soft hearts.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.061
(laughs)

16:48.100 --> 16:50.568
And... you're not involved now

16:50.610 --> 16:52.601
in drugs?

16:58.110 --> 17:01.147
What's that suit you're wearing?

17:01.180 --> 17:03.182
Suit?

17:06.090 --> 17:08.354
Uh...

17:08.390 --> 17:09.755
Oh, it's Calvin Klein. Why?

17:09.790 --> 17:13.692
You need a lot of suits
like that to work here, do you?

17:13.730 --> 17:15.357
Yeah. Yeah, some.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.459
But you don't wear suits like
that when you're out and about?

17:17.500 --> 17:20.162
I mean, on weekends, you don't
wear suits like that, do you?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.667
No.

17:21.700 --> 17:25.067
Good, 'cause then people might
think you're gay or something.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.673
Oh... you're not gay, are you?

17:31.710 --> 17:33.712
I'm sorry if...

17:36.880 --> 17:39.644
Is something... the matter,

17:39.690 --> 17:40.816
Mr. Saverese?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.055
What, like you being gay?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.048
I don't mind gay people.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.727
Why don't we take this up
tomorrow?

17:49.760 --> 17:52.593
Why? Did I offend you?

17:52.630 --> 17:54.291
No. No, Ijust...

17:54.340 --> 17:56.467
I think
we should take this up tomorrow

17:56.500 --> 17:58.058
when Alicia's back
in the office.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.839
Sure. Sure.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.842
Yeah. I mean, why not pay
for two lawyers, not just one?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.814
Yeah, that's, uh...

18:08.850 --> 18:10.841
That sounds good.

18:11.850 --> 18:14.250
Okay.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.268
(Will clears throat)

18:26.300 --> 18:29.133
I was walking to the bar's
restroom when I ran into

18:29.170 --> 18:30.706
Judge Creary.
ALICIA:
Did you approach him?

18:30.740 --> 18:33.129
No. I was walking past
him, and he called me.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.136
And what did you
talk about?
He told me

18:35.180 --> 18:37.603
I was losing
and that my client was guilty.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.379
Actus reus.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.275
A guilty act?
Yes. I told him

18:41.320 --> 18:43.140
he hadn't yet heard
all the evidence,

18:43.190 --> 18:45.579
and that's when he accused me
of being a disbarred lawyer

18:45.620 --> 18:47.178
and of bribing judges.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.187
Ugh! Oh!

18:48.220 --> 18:49.312
Objection. Your Honor,

18:49.360 --> 18:51.555
if Judge Creary would like
to testify, he is welcome,

18:51.590 --> 18:54.855
but he should refrain
from editorializing.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.924
Excuse me. I think

18:55.960 --> 18:57.825
His Ho_nor has shown
great patience, young lady.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.326
I know what you think,
Your Honor.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.860
Does that mean _
you overrule my objection?

19:04.910 --> 19:08.175
The gallery
should remain silent.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.779
ALICIA:
How did the conversation end

19:11.810 --> 19:13.414
with Judge Creary, Mr. Gardner?

19:13.450 --> 19:14.769
He told me, if it was up to him,

19:14.820 --> 19:16.378
I would never practice
law again.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.581
Thank you, no further questions.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.383
Hello, Mr. Gardner.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.557
Hi, Counselor.

19:23.590 --> 19:26.627
You say Judge Creary accused you
of being a disbarred lawyer,

19:26.660 --> 19:27.957
and that was untrue?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.820
Yes, I was suspended
for six months

19:29.860 --> 19:31.566
but not permanently disbarred.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.238
Congratulations.

19:33.270 --> 19:34.567
Objection.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.261
I'll withdraw that,
Counselor.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.961
Do you know

19:38.010 --> 19:39.705
what the first
search result is

19:39.740 --> 19:40.832
when you type
"Will Gardner"

19:40.880 --> 19:42.939
into a Chum_hum
search engine?

19:42.980 --> 19:45.642
That was a practical
joke by an opponent.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.272
Would you mind reading
what it says there?

19:50.320 --> 19:52.288
"Do you want 'Will Gardner
Disbarred Lavwer'?"

19:52.320 --> 19:53.912
But, again, this is a joke.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.916
But you can understand
why he might mistake you

19:55.960 --> 19:57.655
for a disbarred lawyer.

19:57.690 --> 19:59.248
The fact that I was
arguing in his court

19:59.290 --> 20:01.520
might suggest otherwise.
But it's no secret you've had

20:01.560 --> 20:03.619
troubles this past year.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.321
You were suspended for
stealing money from a client.

20:06.370 --> 20:07.337
Is that correct?
Yes,

20:07.370 --> 20:08.598
but I replaced it.
Judge Creary

20:08.640 --> 20:10.528
called you a thief
and a liar.

20:10.570 --> 20:11.935
Can you really say

20:11.970 --> 20:12.959
those characterizations
are inaccurate?

20:13.010 --> 20:13.977
DIANE:
Objection, Your Honor.

20:14.010 --> 20:14.806
The question is

20:14.840 --> 20:17.377
whether or not
Judge Creary showed bias

20:17.410 --> 20:18.206
by making
these comments,

20:18.250 --> 20:19.672
not whether or not
they were true.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.974
Sustained.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.749
Wow, that's some defense.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.610
Our lavwer may be
a thief and a liar,

20:26.650 --> 20:27.685
but the judge
really can't say it.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.551
DIANE:
Objection.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.421
DUNAWAY:
Sustained.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.519
No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.968
I'd like to call
Judge Creary to the stand.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.560
He's had a change of heart
and would like to testify.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.401
You've heard

20:44.440 --> 20:46.362
Mr. Gardner's accusations
against you?

20:46.410 --> 20:47.638
I have.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.342
And did you, in fact,
call him a thief?

20:50.380 --> 20:51.642
No, I did not.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.475
Did you offer your opinions
on the current case?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.111
I did not.

20:56.150 --> 20:57.549
Oh, my God, you're lying.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.545
Mr. Gardner,

20:58.590 --> 21:00.319
you'll find yourself
in contempt.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.988
Do you know why Mr. Gardner
would be accusing you of this?

21:03.020 --> 21:05.056
Well, I can only guess
that he had...

21:05.090 --> 21:07.797
he had many objections
sustained against him that day

21:07.830 --> 21:08.990
and he thought I was biased.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.294
HELLINGER:
But everything else
he said about this...

21:11.330 --> 21:13.366
bar encounter is a lie?

21:13.400 --> 21:14.992
Yes.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.760
We need to find
a witness from the bar.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.335
(mellow jazz playing)

21:28.850 --> 21:30.340
Hi.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.516
Hi.

21:31.550 --> 21:34.348
That was nice,
getting a call.

21:34.390 --> 21:37.450
I'm sorry, did I
stop calling you or
you stop calling me?

21:37.490 --> 21:39.481
No, I called you--
you just didn't return.

21:39.530 --> 21:42.351
Three times.
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm a jerk.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.765
(laughs)

21:43.800 --> 21:44.892
Mm, so...

21:44.930 --> 21:46.591
how much is
this one worth?

21:46.630 --> 21:48.495
$80 a glass?
No, four dollars.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.065
Things are tough
in Spain these days.
Oh, of course.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.931
How is the family fortune?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.504
Reduced by 70%.

21:55.540 --> 21:58.441
Ouch. Things are
not great all over.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.549
No.

21:59.580 --> 22:02.117
I read about your firm.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.879
And you.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.718
Where are you going
after this?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.751
Where am I going?
Mm-hmm.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.883
I don't know.
What about you?

22:12.930 --> 22:15.899
I was gonna go home
and read a briefing.

22:15.930 --> 22:18.797
A big long brief
about farm subsidies.

22:18.830 --> 22:22.129
Sounds like a
Thursday night.

22:22.170 --> 22:24.365
Light some candles,
run a bath,

22:24.410 --> 22:27.937
read about the viability of
ethanol as a fuel supplement.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.971
How viable is it?

22:31.010 --> 22:33.046
Pretty damn viable.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.514
More so than
you might think.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.158
That's not bad
for four dollars.

22:43.190 --> 22:45.078
Oh, I lied-- it's
Dominio de Pingus.

22:45.130 --> 22:48.019
It's $180 a glass.

22:48.060 --> 22:50.528
I'll count
pennies tomorrow.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.868
ELI:
Why aren't you
reading your e-mails?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.993
I sent you three
e-mails today.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.962
I am reading my e-mails.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.662
Just not mine?
Well,
I always know

22:59.710 --> 23:02.133
when it's important,
you'll seek me out, and...

23:02.180 --> 23:04.171
here you are.
(chuckles)

23:04.210 --> 23:06.041
Uh... that one...
that one there.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.843
Click on it.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.019
And now the attachment.
Click on it.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.018
(bell rings)

23:12.050 --> 23:15.110
(indistinct chatter)

23:17.120 --> 23:19.884
Have you been hanging
around schools, Eli?

23:19.930 --> 23:21.420
It's not ours.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.496
This is a tracker
from the other side.

23:23.530 --> 23:25.020
That always sounds so sci-fi.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.537
Eli...
It's the other
campaign.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.470
They're looking for
vulnerabilities.

23:33.510 --> 23:35.637
She was followed to school?
This campaign

23:35.680 --> 23:37.477
has become about
family values.

23:37.510 --> 23:40.479
Kresteva has a kid
with leukemia-- he
wants to make it seem

23:40.520 --> 23:43.114
that you have a smoker
who cuts class.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.908
What is going on
with my life?

23:51.990 --> 23:53.526
DEBORAH:
Where are you?
We need you over here.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.492
Appreciate the opportunity...

23:54.530 --> 23:55.758
It's not about the opportunity.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.461
The campaign needs you, Jay.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.630
Things are falling apart here,
and they're getting angry at me.

24:01.670 --> 24:02.967
I can't work full-time.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.501
What about after school?

24:04.540 --> 24:05.609
ALICIA:
Grace, these trackers

24:05.640 --> 24:07.471
ALICIA:
Did you see anyone
follow you to school?

24:07.510 --> 24:08.477
GRACE:
No.

24:08.510 --> 24:09.772
I don't know.

24:09.810 --> 24:10.970
I'll call you again.

24:11.010 --> 24:11.977
Hey, n-n-no...

24:12.010 --> 24:14.114
GRACE:
This is so creepy.

24:14.150 --> 24:16.573
(sighs)

24:16.620 --> 24:18.918
I was sitting on a bench
talking to a friend.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.042
What's wrong with that?

24:20.090 --> 24:21.489
Who's the friend?

24:21.520 --> 24:23.488
Connon
Who's Connor?

24:23.530 --> 24:24.781
A boy.

24:24.830 --> 24:25.888
Grace...

24:25.930 --> 24:27.955
I'm not smoking.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.628
I know. I didn't
say you were.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.898
These trackers...

24:31.930 --> 24:33.568
they will find any opportunity

24:33.600 --> 24:35.739
to paint you
in a negative light, Grace.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.738
I know. Is that it?

24:39.110 --> 24:40.600
Mom...

24:40.640 --> 24:42.608
Zach, could you
give us a second?

24:45.180 --> 24:46.670
The girl who...

24:46.710 --> 24:49.247
committed suicide--

24:49.280 --> 24:50.781
why?

24:50.820 --> 24:52.788
Why did she do it?

24:52.820 --> 24:55.516
I don't know.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.084
She was cutting.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.781
She w...

24:58.830 --> 25:00.855
Cutting herself?

25:00.900 --> 25:04.097
It's not that weird;
a lot of girls do it.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.098
Cut themselves? Why?

25:06.130 --> 25:08.064
Why would they do that?

25:09.640 --> 25:12.302
I don't know.
Self-hatred?

25:12.340 --> 25:15.776
I... Ithink
it feels good to heal.

25:19.850 --> 25:22.546
_ You would _tell me
if there's anything wrong?

25:22.580 --> 25:25.048
I'm not cutting, Mom.
I know.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.682
It doesn't have to be that.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.278
Ijust...

25:28.320 --> 25:29.958
I love you, Grace.

25:29.990 --> 25:32.584
I love you, too.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.029
I know.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.857
You're a good girl.

25:46.610 --> 25:49.704
*

25:49.740 --> 25:51.571
So, what do you need, Will?

25:51.610 --> 25:54.579
What do I need?
Why do you think
I need anything?

25:55.620 --> 25:57.611
That look on your face.

25:57.650 --> 25:59.117
You're beautiful.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.653
Oh, yeah?

26:01.690 --> 26:03.009
Mm.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.028
The other night
with Judge Creary...
(laughs): Oh.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.857
What?
No, I thought it was that.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.755
He denied it.
It's my word against his.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.721
You were there.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.897
So that's why you're here?

26:10.930 --> 26:11.999
No.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.191
But it
wouldn't hurt.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.891
(laughs)
This is why

26:16.940 --> 26:19.033
I am not gonna do it.
Do what?

26:19.070 --> 26:21.630
Testify for you.
Creary was just
showing off for me

26:21.680 --> 26:23.671
and giving you a hard
time 'cause we dated.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.769
And you're the one who
blew it out of proportion.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.209
He said my client was guilty.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.649
People say a lot of things.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.045
You said that you
returned my phone call.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.286
So this is about not
returning your calls?

26:31.320 --> 26:34.209
No, this is about not seeing
the upside of crossing a judge.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.989
The upside is: it's the truth.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.284
And that's your
real goal here?

26:38.330 --> 26:39.957
(whispering):
The truth.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.252
(laughs softly)

26:41.300 --> 26:42.824
We could subpoena you.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.862
Yeah, you could.

26:53.340 --> 26:56.173
MAN:
Whoa. Cary Agos.

26:56.210 --> 26:58.770
What, you come to tell us
how the other half lives?

26:58.810 --> 27:00.072
Still a $200 buy-in?

27:00.110 --> 27:02.817
_ I don't know--_ _
might be time to raise it.

27:02.850 --> 27:05.614
(laughs)

27:08.920 --> 27:11.081
So, you happy to be back
at your old firm?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.951
Ah, Gardner-- he's
got it out for me.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.753
Yeah? Man, he's
got it out for everyone.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.898
Oh, yeah, your boss,
he must be pissed.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.896
You still clerking
with Creary?

27:22.940 --> 27:26.159
(chuckles):
Yeah. He is not happy.

27:26.210 --> 27:29.771
But, well, he hasn't
been happy for a while.

27:29.810 --> 27:32.677
Oh, yeah? Why is that,
the double shifts?

27:32.710 --> 27:34.814
No, his wife.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.977
Well, I guess his ex-wife.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.113
(chuckles)

27:39.150 --> 27:41.755
DIANE: _Is it fair
to con5ider you

27:41.790 --> 27:44.224
a reluctant witn_ess
here, Mr. Chapin?

27:44.260 --> 27:47.752
It is fair to consider me both
reluctant and really pissed.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.724
Because you've
been subpoenaed?
Yes.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.261
And because I thought I
was talking to a friend.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.167
Now, you are
Judge Creary's
law clerk?

27:58.440 --> 28:00.328
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.

28:00.370 --> 28:02.406
Don't worry.
After Will Gardner's

28:02.440 --> 28:06.706
suspension, what did you
observe Judge Creary saying

28:06.750 --> 28:10.015
about Mr. Gardner?
He called Mr. Gardner a liar

28:10.050 --> 28:13.087
and a thief.
And these are the same
words that Judge Creary

28:13.120 --> 28:15.782
denied speaking
in their recent bar encounter?

28:15.820 --> 28:16.912
Objection, Your Honor.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.825
Sustained.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.054
HELLINGER:
To your knowledge,

28:20.090 --> 28:22.991
Mr. Chapin, is Judge Creary
the only judge in Cook County

28:23.030 --> 28:24.793
who made derogatory
comments about Will

28:24.830 --> 28:26.491
during his suspension?
No.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.031
Everyone was talking about it.

28:28.070 --> 28:30.095
And all the judges were
joking about it, too.

28:30.140 --> 28:33.132
Which judges in particular
do you recall made comments?

28:33.170 --> 28:35.900
(sighs)
Paver, um...

28:35.940 --> 28:37.749
Worth...

28:37.780 --> 28:39.372
Ferraro...
Judge John Ferraro?

28:39.410 --> 28:41.514
Didn't he recently
rule in favor

28:41.550 --> 28:43.882
of Will Gardner
on a vehicular_
manslaughter swt?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.387
I believe so.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.785
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

28:46.820 --> 28:47.889
It's relevant because it proves

28:47.920 --> 28:50.150
a judge is fully capable
of putting personal feelings

28:50.190 --> 28:52.454
about defense _counsel aside
when deCIding a case.

28:52.490 --> 28:53.798
I quite agree.

28:53.830 --> 28:55.058
Overruled.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.954
DIANE:
We need to move off

28:57.000 --> 28:58.365
of the personal
animus strategy.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.265
The key is his
prejudging our
client's guilt.

29:00.300 --> 29:03.167
Well, what about
the witness at the bar?
She won't testify.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.805
Can't we subpoena her?
I'm not sure
she'll tell the truth.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.400
What else did your friend
say about Creary?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.305
(sighs)
You mean my ex-friend?

29:10.340 --> 29:11.807
Well, since Creary's divorce,

29:11.850 --> 29:13.909
he's been struggling
with alcohol.

29:13.950 --> 29:16.009
Going to AA?
Yes. Why?

29:16.050 --> 29:17.847
Are we sure we
want to go there?
I don't know.

29:17.890 --> 29:21.212
If you go nuclear,
don't leave missiles
in your Silo.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.559
(school bell ringing)

29:24.590 --> 29:27.889
So, are you gonna
go to the funeral?

29:29.030 --> 29:32.067
You should go to the funeral.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.295
Why are you so
interested in her?

29:34.340 --> 29:36.558
What do you mean?
I'm not interested in her.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.068
All you want to do
is talk about her.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.271
I don't know.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.847
I just feel bad.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.541
I thought you
didn't know her.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.912
I know, but I could
still feel bad.

29:47.950 --> 29:50.043
It's just weird.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.048
Her being dead.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.580
(sighs):
It's not weird.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.588
Do you believe in God?

29:55.620 --> 29:58.157
No.
Why not?

29:58.190 --> 29:59.418
(laughs)

29:59.460 --> 30:01.599
Why is that funny to you?

30:01.630 --> 30:03.393
You're funny.

30:03.430 --> 30:07.389
Girls don't come here
to... talk about God.

30:09.470 --> 30:11.938
They come in here
to have sex?

30:16.010 --> 30:17.875
Is that what she did?

30:19.950 --> 30:21.941
The other Grace?

30:21.980 --> 30:23.049
Uh-huh.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.618
We're not gonna have sex.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.914
I didn't ask you.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.087
You're right.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.825
No.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.868
So that's it?

30:40.900 --> 30:42.868
I'm late to class.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.437
Tomorrow?

31:02.660 --> 31:04.423
(phone rings)

31:04.460 --> 31:07.349
Yeah.

31:07.390 --> 31:09.927
Oh, hi.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.963
No, no, that's good.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.139
Do you mind looking
into Judge Creary's drinking?

31:15.170 --> 31:17.161
Okay.
Everything okay?

31:17.200 --> 31:19.964
Yeah, my daughter's two steps
away from dating Keith Moon,

31:20.010 --> 31:22.137
but everything's fine.

31:22.180 --> 31:26.298
Look, if you want to go out
for a drink or you want

31:26.350 --> 31:28.215
to speak, just give
me a call, all right,

31:28.250 --> 31:30.309
and I'll get
onto that.

31:30.350 --> 31:31.510
All right,
take care.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.541
(phone beeps)

31:35.160 --> 31:36.184
Who's that?

31:36.220 --> 31:38.450
Work.

31:38.490 --> 31:41.129
The place where I work.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.629
Was it Cary?

31:46.670 --> 31:49.389
It wasn't Cary.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.900
You need to give it a rest on
the whole alpha male thing.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.671
(door closes)

32:21.470 --> 32:23.461
(phone rings)

32:26.240 --> 32:27.400
Yeah?

32:31.480 --> 32:32.640
I don't understand.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.739
How can we take
a ten percent dive in I.T.?

32:34.780 --> 32:36.645
We were in the middle
of a reorganization,

32:36.680 --> 32:38.238
and we've hit a bump.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.382
What bump?

32:39.420 --> 32:41.388
I lost my volunteers.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.557
Well, get new ones.

32:42.590 --> 32:44.023
No, there was one I needed.

32:44.060 --> 32:44.879
And what happened?
He's in school.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.249
He can't work anymore.
Are you insane?

32:46.290 --> 32:47.621
He's in school
and he can't work anymore?

32:47.660 --> 32:49.321
You tell him he has to work.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.395
He's new. _
He's not very committed...

32:50.430 --> 32:51.988
Okay, shut up.

32:52.030 --> 32:54.066
Is he here?

32:55.200 --> 32:57.395
Where?

32:59.340 --> 33:02.229
Jay, this is Eli Gold.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.269
Jay is a new volunteer.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.471
Where are you going?

33:07.510 --> 33:09.319
No, kid, you're staying.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.580
Mr. Gold would like
to offer you a job.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.287
No, let him go.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.726
Damn it.

33:28.300 --> 33:31.428
Are you pacing me?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.370
MAN:
Another round, please.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.332
Two more beers?
Sure.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.746
Want me to get her number
for you?

33:43.350 --> 33:46.239
Do you ever get jealous?

33:46.290 --> 33:47.587
Do I get jealous?

33:47.620 --> 33:49.451
Yeah, why?

33:49.490 --> 33:50.684
Of who?

33:50.720 --> 33:53.052
I don't know.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.398
People I'm dating.

33:54.430 --> 33:56.352
When they meet
someone else.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.664
I'm narcissistic enough
to think

33:58.700 --> 34:01.760
women should give up sex
altogether after me.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.030
You jealous of someone?

34:06.870 --> 34:09.338
How do you stop being jealous?

34:11.380 --> 34:13.701
You stop caring.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.274
Start seeing other people.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.675
Like anything,
it wears off after a while.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.210
Yeah.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.717
Or... you tell
the person,

34:20.750 --> 34:24.151
"I don't want you
to see other people."

34:25.360 --> 34:27.123
But then you have to be ready
to back it up.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.390
Thank you.

34:30.430 --> 34:32.193
You're welcome.

34:32.230 --> 34:34.596
That's a very genuine
"thank you" from you.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.428
I have to go to
an AA meeting now.

34:46.450 --> 34:48.441
Hello. W_elcome.
Hi.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.879
Hel_lo.
Hi.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.114
Oh, is this
your first time?

34:51.150 --> 34:52.378
At this meeting, yeah.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.648
I usually go to the one
across town.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.157
That's great.
Well, welcome.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.282
Thank you.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.187
Actually, I'm looking
for a friend of mine, Harrison.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.720
Do you know if
he's coming tonight?

35:00.760 --> 35:01.795
I don't.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.422
He's usually here by now.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.361
He's doing well,
isn't he?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.662
Thank you, Mrs. Vaughn.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.863
Do you attend
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings

35:10.900 --> 35:12.538
with Judge Harrison Creary?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.771
Mrs. Vaughn?

35:20.580 --> 35:22.377
I do.

35:22.420 --> 35:26.288
What does the judge share with
the group at these meetings?

35:26.320 --> 35:27.480
Your Honor,
this is truly outrageous.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.717
Alcoholics Anonymous has a
strict code of confidentiality.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.455
Yes, Counselor, unfortunately,
AA is not covered

35:32.490 --> 35:34.355
by client, patient,
or clergy privileges,

35:34.400 --> 35:36.527
and answers can be
compelled here.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.529
I don't agree with this,
but the law is the law.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.459
Again, what has the judge shared
at these meetings, ma'am?

35:42.500 --> 35:45.708
He recently returned
to addiction

35:45.740 --> 35:47.435
when his wife left him.

35:47.470 --> 35:49.279
CREARY:
This is cruel.

35:53.750 --> 35:57.618
And did he say what happened
when he drank?

35:57.650 --> 35:59.584
He blacked out.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.350
Therefore,
if Judge Creary had indeed

36:02.390 --> 36:05.279
Prejudged Mrs. Van Zanten for--
what did he call it?--

36:05.330 --> 36:06.354
her actus reus--

36:06.390 --> 36:09.427
and if he said as much
to Mr. Gardner at the bar,

36:09.460 --> 36:13.624
then due to his blackouts,
he might not remember it now?

36:13.670 --> 36:16.662
Ms. Hellinger, aren't
you going to object?

36:16.700 --> 36:18.509
Am I going to...?

36:18.540 --> 36:19.802
Yes.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.705
Thank you, Your Honor.

36:21.740 --> 36:23.469
Sustained. Leading.

36:23.510 --> 36:24.875
No further questions,
Your Honor.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.872
ELI:
I'll keep this short and sweet.

36:27.910 --> 36:31.482
You want to work for your dad's
campaign, I won't stop you.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.714
But I can't speak
for your mother.

36:32.750 --> 36:33.910
Now, if you want
some advice

36:33.950 --> 36:36.953
as to how to present it to your
mother, I would offer it.

36:36.990 --> 36:38.958
Hey.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.526
Who's that?

36:40.560 --> 36:41.959
Connon

36:42.000 --> 36:43.353
Who's Connor?

36:43.400 --> 36:44.628
Grace's friend.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.922
Grace.

36:46.970 --> 36:47.925
Mr. Gold.

36:47.970 --> 36:49.597
About my mom.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.562
Yes, yes, the best way
to present it to your mom

36:51.610 --> 36:54.374
is that you're becoming a part
of the campaign anyway.

36:54.410 --> 36:57.629
You don't want to hate yourself
by making your dad lose

36:57.680 --> 36:59.477
when there's a chance
you could help your dad win.

36:59.510 --> 37:00.545
Okay.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.409
Best not to say I was here.

37:06.450 --> 37:07.542
You weren't here.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.909
I am ready to rule.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.807
This trial has been,
above all, angering.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.944
I believe the defense--
the ostensible defense--

37:35.980 --> 37:38.619
at the moment it seems
to be the prosecution--

37:38.650 --> 37:41.357
they have resorted to rank
character assassination.

37:41.390 --> 37:42.584
They have inflicted

37:42.620 --> 37:44.656
on Judge Harrison Creary
a personal examination

37:44.690 --> 37:47.420
that none of us
could survwe.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.449
They...
(door opens)

37:52.800 --> 37:55.963
They have dug
through his confessions.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.763
They have subpoenaed innocent
bystanders and forced them

37:57.800 --> 37:59.461
to testify.
I am,

37:59.510 --> 38:00.659
to be frank, disgusted.

38:07.580 --> 38:10.071
Unfortunately I believe
the defense has proven its case.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.645
I have doubts about
Judge Creary's memory

38:12.690 --> 38:14.658
of the evening
in question.

38:14.690 --> 38:17.579
To be factually correct
does not mean to be right.

38:17.620 --> 38:18.689
Therefore, I am granting

38:18.730 --> 38:20.823
the defense's motion
to substitute.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.999
Next time in
front of a jury.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.473
I think you'll want to consider
taking a plea first-- 25 years?

38:42.520 --> 38:43.509
And why would we do that?

38:43.550 --> 38:45.780
Because your client was
cheating on her husband.

38:45.820 --> 38:47.617
No.

38:47.650 --> 38:50.915
Actus reus-- it's not just
Latin for "guilty act."

38:50.960 --> 38:52.655
It's an online forum
for cheating spouses.

38:52.690 --> 38:55.796
That's why Judge Creary
said "actus reus."

38:55.830 --> 38:58.594
Before his divorce
he visited the forum.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.769
That's when he saw
your client's profile.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.791
Still doesn't mean
she killed him.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.138
You're right, but we're
checking the Actus Reus logs,

39:05.170 --> 39:07.104
and my guess is, we'll
find somebody else

39:07.140 --> 39:09.779
your client solicited
to murder her husband.

39:11.780 --> 39:14.476
Or you can take the 25 years.

39:16.450 --> 39:18.441
(thunder rumbling)

39:24.430 --> 39:26.648
You know I share
an office now.

39:26.690 --> 39:28.692
So?
So I don't think
Cary would appreciate

39:28.730 --> 39:30.618
you sitting at his desk.
I've just gotten word

39:30.660 --> 39:33.128
that the trackers are
following Zach, too.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.535
Yeah, we knew that.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.992
Yes.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.632
I just wanted to let you know

39:37.670 --> 39:40.002
that they're involving your
children in the campaign.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.029
I knew that, too.

39:41.070 --> 39:43.607
I thought you might consider

39:43.640 --> 39:44.777
allowing them to
be interviewed.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.675
No.

39:46.710 --> 39:50.612
If Peter loses, you don't want
your kids to blame themselves.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.657
Eli, I'm tired.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.112
Please just go.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.980
Okay.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.021
Can't say I didn't try.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.051
I won't.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.821
(thunder rumbling)

40:14.070 --> 40:15.207
(screams)
Oh.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.037
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.138
Are you all right?

40:18.180 --> 40:20.171
I hope I didn't
ruin your suit.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.199
(grunting)

40:21.250 --> 40:23.172
Hey, sorry, sorry.

40:25.650 --> 40:26.719
Sorry about that.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.752
Hey, let, let me
help you up.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.018
(both grunt)

40:31.090 --> 40:32.853
Aah!

40:32.890 --> 40:33.857
(groaning)

40:36.600 --> 40:40.491
What is that,
Calvin Klein?

40:42.070 --> 40:44.061
(door unlocking)

40:47.610 --> 40:50.238
(sighs)

40:50.280 --> 40:52.475
(keys clang)

40:57.120 --> 40:59.111
Hello.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.679
I want to help
with Dad's campaign.

41:05.930 --> 41:08.694
Okay, let's talk.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.049
I can help,

41:10.100 --> 41:12.125
and Grace and I are already
part of the campaign

41:12.170 --> 41:13.660
whether we want to
be involved or not.

41:13.700 --> 41:14.735
I don't want
to be part

41:14.770 --> 41:16.863
of the problem, I want to
be part of the solution.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.733
And how do you become
part of the solution?

41:19.770 --> 41:21.874
By helping at the
campaign office.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.798
I'd work on their
computers after school.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.047
It's only a 30-minute drive,
and I'd go straight there.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.775
And you'd only work
in the campaign office?

41:27.810 --> 41:29.118
Yes, Mom,

41:29.150 --> 41:30.970
and I'd still do my homework
afterwards, everything,

41:31.020 --> 41:31.987
I promise.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.147
Should I come back?

41:34.190 --> 41:36.181
No, we're fine.

41:37.890 --> 41:39.858
Okay, I'll think
about it.

41:39.890 --> 41:40.686
Okay.

41:40.730 --> 41:42.027
(indistinct yelling
over television)

41:42.060 --> 41:43.027
You will?

41:43.060 --> 41:45.722
I will.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.761
What was that about?

41:50.170 --> 41:52.138
_ _You smell
like Cigarette smoke.

41:52.170 --> 41:53.137
It's not me.

41:53.170 --> 41:54.603
It's him?
Yeah.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.937
(indistinct yelling and gunfire)

41:55.980 --> 41:57.971
(sighs)

41:59.850 --> 42:08.781
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching and gunfire)
