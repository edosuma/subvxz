WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:01.467
Notify missing persons.

00:01.476 --> 00:03.873
- We found Brooke Dodson.
- Young girl, long red hair...

00:03.883 --> 00:05.904
- You know what that means, Stevie.
- 15 years ago,

00:05.914 --> 00:08.883
Flowers was the main suspect in the
serial killing of Nancy Brown,

00:08.893 --> 00:11.235
Paula King and Wendy
Fraser, all 14 years old.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.842
Hextall Importers.

00:12.852 --> 00:15.579
What makes a dormant virus
like Flowers wake up

00:15.589 --> 00:17.469
after 15 years and just
start killing again?

00:17.479 --> 00:18.497
Maybe he never stopped.

00:18.507 --> 00:20.313
Found my dad hanging in the garage.

00:20.323 --> 00:22.146
Brooke Dodson's linked to my dad's case.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.770
Detectives for the Metropolitan
Police Homicide Division

00:24.780 --> 00:26.704
discovered the body of Mr. Flowers.

00:26.714 --> 00:27.844
He didn't kill himself.

00:27.854 --> 00:30.305
It was someone who knew the inner
workings of a crime scene.

00:30.316 --> 00:32.116
- Like a cop?
- Yeah.

00:32.127 --> 00:33.993
But Stevie, Flowers left you a note.

00:35.581 --> 00:37.549
Why, why, Stevie?

00:37.559 --> 00:39.079
Why'd you have to keep digging?

00:39.089 --> 00:40.881
Mom said to make her a margarita.

00:40.891 --> 00:42.987
Katie, when did she say
this to you? Where is she?

00:42.998 --> 00:44.631
She went for a walk with Grandpa.

00:47.502 --> 00:50.036
Stevie?

01:13.352 --> 01:15.453
Katie, did your mom

01:15.463 --> 01:18.488
say anything else when she left?
Anything at all?

01:18.498 --> 01:21.284
- I don't think so. Why?
- What's wrong?

01:21.294 --> 01:24.128
- Is there a problem?
- What about your grandpa?

01:24.138 --> 01:26.830
Did he seem upset at all?
How was he acting?

01:26.840 --> 01:27.989
Fine.

01:27.999 --> 01:30.309
You're scaring her.
What's this all about?

01:31.147 --> 01:33.236
Jack? What is it?

01:33.246 --> 01:35.918
Jack? Jack!

01:56.796 --> 01:58.457
She took her gun.

01:59.027 --> 02:02.538
Why would she do that? Why would
she take her gun on a walk?

02:02.548 --> 02:05.283
I don't know. There's gotta be a reason.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.091
The same reason I found her
phone tossed on the driveway?

02:08.101 --> 02:09.894
I'm calling Harry.

02:12.851 --> 02:15.644
- He's not answering.
- His car's gone.

02:15.654 --> 02:17.622
Where would they go, Helen? Do you know?

02:17.632 --> 02:20.736
Well, maybe they just went for a drive.
Maybe they needed to talk.

02:20.746 --> 02:23.312
- With her gun?!
- I don't know.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.889
Fiona, it's me. I...

02:27.899 --> 02:31.367
We have a problem.
I think Stevie's missing.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.335
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:47.818 --> 02:49.560
- Excuse me.

02:50.688 --> 02:52.161
What's going on here?

02:52.857 --> 02:55.416
- Are you Jonathan Hall?
- Yeah, why?

02:55.426 --> 02:57.904
Inspector Currie would like
to talk to you.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.589
OK, everybody, listen up.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.425
We're gonna run through what
we know, starting from the top.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.428
When did Stevie take out Flowers' file?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.271
I saw him on shift.

03:10.282 --> 03:12.674
She said she was looking into the
death scene; timeline looked off.

03:12.685 --> 03:14.721
So what, she didn't think
that Flowers killed himself?

03:14.732 --> 03:17.437
I guess. We didn't talk
about it after that.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.439
I just thought she was
digging at old wounds.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.175
- And did she tell Harry about her theory?
- Yeah.

03:22.185 --> 03:23.896
She called him and he
came over for dinner.

03:23.907 --> 03:25.611
I thought they went up to
her room to talk about it.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.547
- How long after that did they leave?
- Not long.

03:27.557 --> 03:31.350
They left the front door open. Stevie
told Katie she wanted a margarita.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.599
I knew something was up
because she hates tequila,

03:33.610 --> 03:35.260
so I went outside and found her phone.

03:35.271 --> 03:37.708
OK, we already have a BOLO
out on them in addition

03:37.718 --> 03:40.599
to a description of Harry's car.
Intelligence is wiring the phone

03:40.610 --> 03:42.628
so give them the floor, please.
Who's checking hospitals?

03:42.638 --> 03:45.564
I am. I am. There's nothing
yet, but I'll try back in 20.

03:45.574 --> 03:49.402
Make it 10. Stevie's weapon is
MIA, so no missteps, got that?

03:49.412 --> 03:51.398
Her gun's missing?

03:51.409 --> 03:53.197
What the hell's going on?
Where are the kids?

03:53.208 --> 03:54.873
They're fine. They're
upstairs with Helen.

03:54.883 --> 03:56.805
Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

03:56.816 --> 03:59.076
I... It died. Where's Stevie?

03:59.087 --> 04:02.648
She left with Harry.
I found her phone outside,

04:02.658 --> 04:05.417
her gun is missing...
They're gone, Jono.

04:05.427 --> 04:08.047
- What do you mean they're gone?
- We have a situation

04:08.058 --> 04:11.756
that we're dealing with and I
need you to stay clearheaded.

04:11.766 --> 04:13.578
What kind of situation?
What are we talking...

04:13.589 --> 04:17.680
It's OK. Go wait with the family.
Someone will be up to talk to you.

04:22.212 --> 04:24.329
We still don't have a signal
on Harry's phone?

04:24.340 --> 04:28.053
No, we've been trying for over an hour.
He must've taken the battery out.

04:28.064 --> 04:29.743
OK. Keep trying.

04:30.385 --> 04:33.197
Before we jump to any more
conclusions, I need more information.

04:33.208 --> 04:35.576
Get me Helen Barker. I want
the family down at the division.

04:35.587 --> 04:37.982
This place is a crime scene.
You get eyes on the Barker house.

04:37.993 --> 04:39.450
- Already done.
- OK, head over,

04:39.460 --> 04:41.509
start looking. Kyle's
gonna join you after.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.537
After what?

04:42.548 --> 04:45.193
I want you to finish up here, see
if there's anything we missed...

04:45.204 --> 04:48.625
Starting with Jono.
You got a problem with that?

04:49.853 --> 04:52.204
- Why would I?
- Good.

05:07.553 --> 05:11.546
- Who's Irvine?
- Our therapist.

05:11.557 --> 05:13.549
You can call her, she'll tell you.

05:13.559 --> 05:15.397
Little late for an appointment.

05:16.661 --> 05:18.538
We got coffee.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.168
- With your therapist?
- Yeah. We lost track of time.

05:29.839 --> 05:32.268
How were things between
Stevie and her stepfather?

05:32.278 --> 05:34.537
I don't know. Fine, I think.

05:34.547 --> 05:37.573
Anything occur that might explain
why they took off like this?

05:37.583 --> 05:40.743
No. They're close.
He helps out with our kids.

05:40.753 --> 05:43.879
OK, listen...

05:44.709 --> 05:47.917
Did Stevie happen to mention
her father's old Flowers case

05:47.927 --> 05:51.123
- that she was working on again?
- I'm so sick of that name.

05:51.134 --> 05:54.156
Jono, we need you to stay calm, OK?

05:54.166 --> 05:57.482
Don't you tell me to be calm.
Don't you... don't...

05:57.493 --> 05:59.459
My wife is missing and I'm sitting here

05:59.470 --> 06:01.429
answering questions with
the guy she's screwing.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.264
Nothing happened between Stevie and me.

06:03.274 --> 06:06.576
Oh yeah? Nothing? Then look me
in the eyes and say that.

06:08.580 --> 06:11.481
Nothing happened between Stevie and me.

06:13.305 --> 06:16.397
This time. Let me ask you something.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.579
What kind of self-centered idiot

06:18.589 --> 06:20.815
shows up at a married woman's house?

06:20.825 --> 06:22.917
A drunk one.

06:24.929 --> 06:27.288
Listen, do you really wanna do this now,

06:27.298 --> 06:29.390
or do you want to focus
on finding your wife?

06:29.400 --> 06:32.022
Oh please, don't act like you
care about her more than I do,

06:32.033 --> 06:33.117
because you don't.

06:33.128 --> 06:35.021
Is that why you had coffee
with your therapist?

06:35.032 --> 06:36.983
Because you care so much about Stevie...

06:39.376 --> 06:41.635
- Jono...
- No, keep talking. Keep talking.

06:41.645 --> 06:44.004
You don't wanna go down this road, Jono.

06:44.014 --> 06:46.405
If you hit me, I have no choice.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.450
I gotta charge you.

06:58.742 --> 07:00.988
I should've been here.

07:00.998 --> 07:03.390
I would've known, I wouldn't
have let her walk out the door.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.666
You and me both.

07:22.251 --> 07:25.419
Help! Help!

07:49.425 --> 07:51.425
Let's walk through the
details one more time.

07:51.436 --> 07:53.360
At 9 pm last night, detective Hall

07:53.371 --> 07:55.496
left her home with Harry Barker
after going through

07:55.506 --> 07:58.265
the Alvin Flowers casefile. Why?

07:58.275 --> 08:01.337
Stevie thought the death scene was fake.
She told Harry.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.167
Maybe they came up with a lead together,

08:03.178 --> 08:05.425
so she grabbed her gun and
they went to go check it out.

08:05.436 --> 08:06.887
She would've told Jack.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.310
Instead, she asks for a drink
that makes her sick

08:09.321 --> 08:10.685
and says she's going for a walk.

08:10.696 --> 08:13.262
- Alright, so then that's the signal.
- So why'd she feel like that?

08:13.273 --> 08:14.497
She couldn't communicate
in front of Harry.

08:14.508 --> 08:16.984
This is where her
missing weapon comes in.

08:16.994 --> 08:19.820
She found something out
about the Flowers death scene

08:19.830 --> 08:23.239
and it might have been something
Harry didn't want her to know.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.259
It was his old case.

08:26.397 --> 08:27.731
Where are we on his car?

08:27.742 --> 08:29.929
Nowhere. It's a really
old car, there's no GPS.

08:29.939 --> 08:32.097
I did get a warrant to track
his credit cards.

08:32.107 --> 08:34.429
Alright, Finch, contact
Public Order Unit.

08:34.441 --> 08:37.323
Let's start organising some searches
of the area, set up a hotline,

08:37.333 --> 08:39.929
get it out to the media ASAP. Thank you.

08:46.055 --> 08:47.085
What about them?

08:47.096 --> 08:49.795
You wanna keep me here for a few
more hours until things progress?

08:49.806 --> 08:52.624
Yeah, someone's figuring out a
hotel. We'll get 'em over later.

08:56.032 --> 09:00.168
So... boss, you know Harry
as well as I do.

09:00.179 --> 09:02.261
Are we really saying...

09:02.271 --> 09:05.377
we think he had something to do
with Alvin Flowers' death?

09:05.388 --> 09:07.755
We're not saying anything right now.

09:25.326 --> 09:27.317
Hi, darling. How are you?

09:27.328 --> 09:29.154
- Where are we?
- Ah, it's good

09:29.164 --> 09:31.741
to finally hear your voice. I
don't like it when you go quiet

09:31.752 --> 09:33.718
like that, it's unnerving, you know?

09:36.891 --> 09:38.095
Look...

09:39.055 --> 09:41.666
I messed up, I know it.
But I can explain.

09:41.676 --> 09:45.002
Explain why you pulled a gun on
me, drove me here and tied me up?

09:45.012 --> 09:48.506
Well, I think you need
to relax, sweetheart.

09:48.516 --> 09:52.009
Don't "sweetheart" me.

09:52.526 --> 09:55.604
Not now, not ever. That life is gone.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.216
OK.

10:01.194 --> 10:02.409
Fine.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.791
That's fair.

10:07.801 --> 10:10.101
I deserved that.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.257
How'd you know about the note, Harry?

10:14.268 --> 10:17.702
Let's know play this game. You know
how I knew. I wrote the damn thing.

10:17.713 --> 10:19.893
So I was right.

10:20.581 --> 10:23.639
Flowers didn't kill
himself, it was a cop.

10:23.649 --> 10:27.382
Just like I thought. But what I
didn't realise is that cop is you.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.512
I had reason to.

10:29.522 --> 10:33.116
After all those things he did
to those poor little girls?

10:33.126 --> 10:36.453
No, that does not make sense.

10:36.463 --> 10:39.822
We were bringing him in.
We were getting justice.

10:39.832 --> 10:41.891
Justice?

10:41.901 --> 10:43.855
The only justice for him is death.

10:43.866 --> 10:45.867
I know it, you know it.
I did the right thing.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.831
And taking me from my family
in the middle of the night,

10:48.841 --> 10:51.703
you did that because you were
doing the right thing?

10:51.714 --> 10:56.620
No. I brought you here so that I
could explain myself. I knew you...

10:56.631 --> 10:59.104
See, I didn't want you to blow
the whole thing open on me

10:59.115 --> 11:00.765
until we'd talked.

11:00.776 --> 11:03.645
So you just want me to
keep my mouth shut?

11:04.282 --> 11:06.374
If that's how you'd like to put it.

11:06.385 --> 11:08.450
We're in this together.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.953
This was our case, and we did
it. We got the bad guy...

11:11.963 --> 11:15.356
And he is the bad guy, not me,
so please don't forget that.

11:16.948 --> 11:18.882
It was my dad's case.

11:18.893 --> 11:20.028
What?

11:20.038 --> 11:22.797
You just said "ours",

11:22.807 --> 11:25.333
like it was yours and mine.

11:25.343 --> 11:27.869
It wasn't. It was yours and Dad's case.

11:27.879 --> 11:30.471
- So what?
- So what?!

11:30.481 --> 11:34.442
My dad killed himself over this case.

11:34.452 --> 11:37.178
Another reason why I couldn't
take it anymore, why I did it.

11:37.188 --> 11:39.447
No.

11:39.457 --> 11:42.691
When I walked onto that
scene at the farmhouse...

11:44.695 --> 11:47.888
Alvin Flowers, the gun,

11:47.898 --> 11:50.298
the way he was sitting...
I recognised that feeling.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.763
It was the same one that I felt
when I walked into the garage

11:55.773 --> 11:58.139
and found my dad hanging 15 years ago.

12:00.143 --> 12:02.602
Of course, sweetheart.

12:02.612 --> 12:05.905
It was another suicide.
They all feel the same.

12:05.915 --> 12:08.483
Except he didn't kill himself.

12:10.487 --> 12:12.479
Did he?

12:12.489 --> 12:14.681
You killed Flowers.

12:14.691 --> 12:16.657
Remember, Harry?

12:24.300 --> 12:27.434
I didn't know Harry
was such a wilderness buff.

12:29.706 --> 12:33.466
Jack, throwing stuff around
won't bring her back any faster.

12:33.476 --> 12:37.002
Yeah, neither will stoic silences.

12:37.012 --> 12:40.539
He's got five copies
of Grimm's Fairy Tales.

12:40.549 --> 12:43.275
'Cause that's super normal.

12:43.285 --> 12:45.277
He's bookmarked Little Red Riding Hood.

12:45.287 --> 12:48.180
Harry always had a theory that
the murders had something to do

12:48.190 --> 12:50.749
with those books.
Turned out to be a dead end,

12:50.759 --> 12:53.284
like everything else for Flowers.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.221
How do we know that Flowers
wasn't a dead end too?

12:56.231 --> 12:58.456
I mean, we didn't prove anything there.

12:58.466 --> 13:01.994
He died before we could,
possibly at the hands of Harry.

13:02.004 --> 13:04.362
I know we're all dancing around it,

13:04.372 --> 13:06.197
but do you think Harry killed Flowers?

13:06.207 --> 13:08.237
Flowers was his guy. Him and Gene's.

13:08.248 --> 13:10.534
They spent the latter part
of their careers chasing him.

13:10.545 --> 13:11.851
Thought Flowers was your guy.

13:11.862 --> 13:15.873
- Only 'cause I inherited him from them.
- Fine. But why wait 15 years?

13:15.883 --> 13:18.440
If you're gonna off the
guy and call it suicide,

13:18.451 --> 13:19.922
why not do it back in the day?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.894
I don't know, maybe Harry
thought he'd stopped.

13:21.905 --> 13:23.359
Then Brooke Dodson happened.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.859
Flowers gets back from Calgary,
picks right up where he left off...

13:25.870 --> 13:28.786
- Harry could've snapped. I almost did.
- Were you guys close?

13:28.796 --> 13:31.522
Harry didn't much care for me.
He didn't hide it, either.

13:31.532 --> 13:33.991
He was a good cop, though.
Always a step ahead.

13:34.001 --> 13:36.794
Anything on there?

13:36.804 --> 13:38.570
Possibly. It's protected.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.732
Hextall Importers.
Isn't that the building

13:42.742 --> 13:44.909
where Brooke Dodson was kept
before she was murdered?

13:47.447 --> 13:49.739
Son of a bitch.

13:49.749 --> 13:52.776
Harry knew where Flowers
was keeping Brooke Dodson.

13:52.786 --> 13:54.944
And he went after him himself.

13:57.323 --> 14:01.327
Like I said, always a step ahead. Hey.

14:01.338 --> 14:04.087
That confirms he was stalking Flowers.
Did 'you find anything else?

14:04.097 --> 14:06.717
No, nothing yet. We gave
Forensics the go-ahead

14:06.728 --> 14:08.524
to rip this place apart...

14:08.534 --> 14:10.994
I got a flash drive. I need Finch.

14:11.004 --> 14:13.796
OK, I'm sending him over. Let
me see what I can dig up here.

14:13.806 --> 14:15.498
Alright.

14:15.508 --> 14:17.733
You can't be serious.

14:17.743 --> 14:20.969
You really think I'd hurt your father?

14:20.979 --> 14:23.105
He was my partner,
I loved him like a brother.

14:23.115 --> 14:25.608
Like you love me?

14:25.618 --> 14:28.578
Look at me!

14:28.588 --> 14:31.379
You tied me up! You did this to me! You!

14:31.389 --> 14:33.816
It was the only way I could
get you to listen to me.

14:33.826 --> 14:35.984
You put a gun in my face!

14:35.994 --> 14:38.120
And you know why you did that?

14:38.130 --> 14:40.388
Because you planned it.

14:40.398 --> 14:43.158
I was getting close to something
that you didn't want me to find out,

14:43.168 --> 14:46.361
- and now you've panicked.
- No, I told you what I did!

14:46.371 --> 14:49.539
Something here does not add up.

14:51.643 --> 14:54.410
So you killed Flowers...
So what? Big deal.

14:56.414 --> 14:59.140
I didn't have any proof.
It was just a theory.

14:59.150 --> 15:01.142
Why would you go to these lengths?

15:02.249 --> 15:04.145
I was ashamed.

15:04.155 --> 15:07.656
Of killing a man that had
murdered four girls?

15:09.660 --> 15:11.660
No way.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.750
It's bigger than that, isn't it?

15:22.239 --> 15:24.673
Did you do something to my dad, Harry?

15:30.113 --> 15:32.506
What did he find out?

15:36.186 --> 15:39.012
What did he find out

15:39.022 --> 15:41.022
that made you kill him?

15:43.359 --> 15:46.795
He found out about the girls.

15:56.673 --> 15:59.031
- How's it going, Finch?
- Be patient.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.774
This thing's locked up
tighter than a drum.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.537
Well, the clock's ticking,
just so you know.

16:02.548 --> 16:04.915
Just get off my back. I'm almost in.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.376
OK, I got it. Couple folders, dates...

16:11.386 --> 16:15.114
No, no. He took a lot of care
to make sure only his eyes saw

16:15.124 --> 16:17.462
what was on there. There's
gotta be a reason.

16:17.473 --> 16:18.494
Here it is.

16:19.661 --> 16:22.554
Harry's photo album looks
a bit different than mine.

16:23.509 --> 16:26.391
He did a stint undercover.
She could be an informant.

16:26.401 --> 16:29.561
This was encrypted like Fort Knox.
Donnie, back me up on this thing.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.531
You don't do this kind of thing
to hide case folders.

16:32.541 --> 16:35.266
You do if you're on
the wrong side of the case.

16:35.276 --> 16:37.836
What's going on? You OK?

16:37.846 --> 16:40.271
No, uh...

16:40.281 --> 16:42.179
Forensics pulled apart the greenhouse.

16:42.190 --> 16:44.089
This was buried in the
ventilation system.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.029
Well, what's in it?

16:46.040 --> 16:48.174
You should, uh...
You should just look, Jack.

16:59.399 --> 17:01.641
Audrey Reed, prostitution and solicitation.

17:01.652 --> 17:03.521
She disappeared in 2006.

17:03.532 --> 17:06.724
She was 18. This is Sarah Keller
and Maya Conley.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.462
They disappeared in 2010,
both runaways, aged 15 and 16.

17:10.472 --> 17:13.732
Amy Lucas disappeared in 2015.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.835
She was 21, and she disappeared
from her rooming house.

17:16.845 --> 17:19.604
Brooke Dodson, Nancy Brown,
Paula King and Wendy Fraser

17:19.614 --> 17:21.839
have all been confirmed
from the samples that we found.

17:21.848 --> 17:24.442
OK, am I the only one
who thinks it's crazy

17:24.452 --> 17:27.444
that Barker might be responsible
for the deaths of 8 people?

17:27.454 --> 17:29.881
And counting. Moretti's still
ID'ing some of the samples.

17:29.891 --> 17:31.916
How the hell did we miss this?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.535
Wrong MO.

17:33.546 --> 17:36.012
It wasn't the red hair, girls
from rough neighbourhoods...

17:36.023 --> 17:37.769
Those are just the ones
he wanted us to find.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.680
The rest of his victims
lived on the fringe.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.659
- Until Brooke Dodson.
- Since 2003,

17:41.692 --> 17:44.387
this guy has just been preying on
people that nobody was gonna miss.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.868
Until Flowers was back in the picture.

17:45.879 --> 17:48.246
Timeline matches exactly dates
Flowers left and returned.

17:48.257 --> 17:51.886
When he came back, Harry
just couldn't help himself.

17:51.897 --> 17:54.831
OK, I'll say it again:
How did we miss this?

18:02.082 --> 18:05.049
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

18:05.059 --> 18:07.442
Helen, why don't you sit down?

18:07.453 --> 18:09.254
Maybe they were on a case,

18:09.265 --> 18:11.457
something they couldn't tell us about,

18:11.468 --> 18:13.956
- something undercover...
- It's snack time.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.192
It's time for snack. I need snack.

18:18.184 --> 18:22.098
I... I didn't bring
anything, Nate, I'm sorry.

18:22.108 --> 18:24.528
How about I get you something
out of the vending machine?

18:24.539 --> 18:26.653
No, I want apple slices
and peanut butter.

18:26.664 --> 18:29.489
I know you do, but we don't have that.
Can I get you a chocolate bar?

18:29.500 --> 18:31.637
- No!
- Will you shut up?

18:31.648 --> 18:33.907
- Hey!
- Don't you get it, stupid?

18:33.918 --> 18:35.378
She's gone!

18:35.388 --> 18:37.817
Mom's gone and she might not be back!

18:37.828 --> 18:40.239
- Katie, wait! Katie!
- Mom's gone?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.278
- Come back here!
- Mom's not coming back?

18:42.289 --> 18:44.418
Why not? Where is she?

18:44.429 --> 18:45.848
- I don't know, Nate.
- Take a walk.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.720
- I'm fine.
- No, no. I said

18:47.731 --> 18:49.293
take a walk. I got this.

18:49.304 --> 18:52.172
- Go see about Katie. Go take care of her.
- Behave.

18:54.597 --> 18:57.531
How about you and I find some
apple slices around here

18:57.542 --> 18:59.976
with your name on them?

19:01.362 --> 19:02.816
Hey, Nate!

19:04.149 --> 19:06.089
Donnie's got a new game on his iPhone

19:06.100 --> 19:08.400
that looks really fun.
You wanna go check it out?

19:11.723 --> 19:13.355
Good boy. Donnie?

19:13.366 --> 19:15.589
Yes? Nate!

19:17.894 --> 19:20.054
I've been around police
enough to know that look.

19:20.064 --> 19:22.064
You found something, didn't you?

19:27.660 --> 19:29.301
What's in the box?

19:30.380 --> 19:31.654
You tell me.

19:32.895 --> 19:36.176
I, uh, I think that is your kit.

19:37.731 --> 19:39.395
And...

19:39.973 --> 19:42.950
I don't... I don't think that
you've shown anyone your kit

19:42.961 --> 19:43.981
and I'd like to see it.

19:43.992 --> 19:46.302
Narcissist, right?

19:46.313 --> 19:48.771
You're playing to my psychology?

19:48.781 --> 19:50.807
It's a wee bit transparent.

19:51.419 --> 19:52.809
Actually,

19:53.486 --> 19:56.987
I would like to see
what my dad died over.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.350
What I'm probably gonna die over.

20:02.672 --> 20:03.954
Fine.

20:16.373 --> 20:17.577
Grimm's?

20:19.878 --> 20:22.003
You used to read Red Riding Hood

20:22.013 --> 20:25.006
to Katie over and over
when she was little.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.709
She... she loved the Big Bad Wolf.

20:27.719 --> 20:30.386
And he loved her.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.327
Is that why they had red hair?
Because of the book?

20:35.046 --> 20:36.749
Stupid.

20:37.428 --> 20:39.420
It had nothing to do with the hair.

20:39.430 --> 20:40.921
So what was it about?

20:40.931 --> 20:43.257
You remind me of Paula.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.226
Yeah.

20:45.236 --> 20:49.030
She loved to talk too.
She was a tough one, that one.

20:50.134 --> 20:52.233
She didn't cry until the very end.

20:52.243 --> 20:55.703
- You remember Paula, don't you?
- Yeah, um...

20:56.884 --> 20:58.438
Paula King.

20:59.055 --> 21:01.976
She came from a big family.

21:01.986 --> 21:04.378
Um... two brothers

21:04.388 --> 21:07.455
and four sisters and her mom, Katherine.

21:09.459 --> 21:11.418
She was a single mom,

21:12.334 --> 21:13.887
barely getting by.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.157
Paula was just another girl

21:17.167 --> 21:19.759
from a troubled home just
looking for a bit of attention.

21:19.769 --> 21:23.471
- That's what the victim profile said.
- And were we right?

21:28.344 --> 21:31.913
Why did you force your way
into my family?

21:33.917 --> 21:36.943
Why did you infiltrate my entire life,

21:36.953 --> 21:39.921
my children and my mom?

21:43.259 --> 21:45.251
We trusted you!

21:47.963 --> 21:50.522
I loved you like a father,

21:50.532 --> 21:52.858
and all this time
I didn't even know you!

21:52.868 --> 21:56.036
Don't look at me with those innocent
eyes. I know what you've been up to.

21:57.852 --> 22:01.033
You're no different than those girls.

22:01.043 --> 22:03.301
You went off the path just like 'em.

22:04.436 --> 22:05.937
What path?

22:07.115 --> 22:08.506
"And her mother said,

22:08.516 --> 22:11.376
"'Come, Little Red Riding Hood.

22:11.386 --> 22:13.186
"'Good little girls stay on the path,

22:13.197 --> 22:14.945
"but sometimes they need help to do that

22:14.956 --> 22:17.815
or the Big Bad Wolf will eat them up.'"

22:17.825 --> 22:20.626
So it's the path
that keeps the girls safe?

22:23.631 --> 22:25.823
I was the only one

22:25.833 --> 22:28.192
who saw their true natures.

22:28.202 --> 22:30.160
I was the one

22:30.170 --> 22:33.572
who was watching them closely.

22:35.576 --> 22:37.942
I could see it in their eyes.

22:48.322 --> 22:52.090
The same way I can see it in your eyes.

22:53.852 --> 22:56.619
When you look at Kyle Price.

24:10.969 --> 24:13.586
Do you recognise these, Helen?

24:13.604 --> 24:17.586
They found them in the ventilation
system of your greenhouse.

24:18.539 --> 24:20.668
I... what...

24:20.678 --> 24:22.727
Is this hair?

24:24.016 --> 24:26.422
This is gonna be hard to hear,

24:27.084 --> 24:30.811
but these samples all match
the girls who were murdered.

24:30.821 --> 24:33.479
The ones from Gene and
Harry's redhead case.

24:33.489 --> 24:37.517
I... What do you mean?
I don't understand.

24:37.527 --> 24:40.954
We think Harry is responsible
for their murders.

24:40.964 --> 24:42.886
That's impossible.

24:43.535 --> 24:47.427
I mean, if Harry had those,
it's... it's probably evidence.

24:47.437 --> 24:51.130
He and Gene devoted all their
waking hours to this case.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.300
No. The police did not
have these samples.

24:54.310 --> 24:57.270
Only the killer did.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.406
You're asking me to believe

25:00.416 --> 25:04.810
that a man I spent 13 years with
is a murderer?

25:04.820 --> 25:07.412
Stevie got too close to
figuring out that it was him,

25:07.422 --> 25:09.815
and now her life is
in danger because of it.

25:09.825 --> 25:11.872
No.

25:11.883 --> 25:14.953
No, he didn't kill anyone. No.

25:14.964 --> 25:16.919
If she was here,

25:16.930 --> 25:19.724
she'd be telling you how crazy that is.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.958
But she isn't here.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.278
Is she?

25:25.006 --> 25:28.441
And we are afraid for
your daughter's life.

26:21.862 --> 26:24.188
Stop! Please!

26:28.734 --> 26:31.627
Come on! Come on! Come on!

26:31.638 --> 26:34.238
Stop! Stop, please!

26:41.848 --> 26:43.840
Call 911!

26:43.850 --> 26:47.710
- My name is Detective Stevie Hall.
- This is Tera Sava.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.079
I'm with Detective Hall...

26:50.089 --> 26:52.781
Oh, my God!!

26:52.791 --> 26:54.750
No!

27:07.306 --> 27:09.400
Sometimes he would've leave you.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.114
He... he wouldn't tell me
where he was going, he just...

27:13.124 --> 27:15.650
he went away for a few hours.

27:15.661 --> 27:17.236
Did he ever go overnight?

27:17.247 --> 27:19.698
I... I never thought anything of it,

27:19.709 --> 27:22.802
because Gene did the same thing.

27:22.813 --> 27:25.305
I thought it was just because
they were cops, you know,

27:25.316 --> 27:27.976
I just... figured it was part of the...

27:28.588 --> 27:30.222
territory.

27:32.426 --> 27:33.817
And...

27:34.736 --> 27:37.488
and when he got home,

27:37.498 --> 27:40.174
he always took a shower.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.705
And he did the laundry.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.072
I didn't notice that until just now.

27:48.814 --> 27:51.596
I guess he was washing
away what he'd done.

27:51.607 --> 27:54.858
So he didn't normally do the laundry?

27:55.619 --> 27:57.049
No.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.812
I remember I used to find these receipts

28:04.823 --> 28:08.062
from this really cheap motel.

28:09.234 --> 28:12.546
I asked him what they were for and...

28:13.327 --> 28:15.726
he said he just wanted
a quiet place to think.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.140
Do you remember what the
name of this motel was?

28:18.151 --> 28:19.828
Do you remember where it was?

28:19.839 --> 28:22.139
I don't know. I don't remember.

28:23.975 --> 28:26.601
It's OK. It's OK.

28:33.479 --> 28:36.238
Jack, get me Audrey Reed's file.

28:36.249 --> 28:39.350
Donnie, you looking into Harry's
credit cards? Focus on motels.

28:46.498 --> 28:48.187
Yeah?

28:48.198 --> 28:50.288
Helen says he'd disappear
to the same cheap motel

28:50.299 --> 28:53.180
when he needed time to think.
That picture was taken in 2006,

28:53.191 --> 28:54.491
same year she went missing.

28:54.502 --> 28:57.468
Crappy paint job, bad carpeting...
It's gotta be a motel.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.699
Guys, guys! I got Fort
York Motel off Highway 7.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.601
Matches the dates of all
the girls and then some.

29:02.612 --> 29:04.736
Call SWAT, tell everyone
I want them suited up now.

29:04.747 --> 29:07.139
We don't have much time.
Jack, pull back.

29:07.150 --> 29:09.983
Evidence is coming in from the Barker
place. I want you go through it all

29:09.994 --> 29:11.806
and see if you can figure out who
the rest of these girls are.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.272
Wait, you're pulling me from the motel?

29:13.283 --> 29:16.215
Well, no one has your eyes and
instincts and you know it.

29:17.119 --> 29:19.753
Are you afraid of me going?

29:19.763 --> 29:21.861
In case she's dead?

29:24.727 --> 29:26.560
Find me those names, Jack.

29:38.380 --> 29:40.372
I heard Fiona pulled you from the raid.

29:40.382 --> 29:42.541
Shouldn't you be gone by now?

29:42.551 --> 29:45.143
Jack... you OK?

29:45.972 --> 29:47.457
I'm fine.

29:48.291 --> 29:51.049
- Come on, Jack...
- I said I'm fine.

29:51.059 --> 29:54.886
- We're gonna find her.
- Yeah?

29:54.896 --> 29:56.496
What if we don't?

29:57.065 --> 30:01.327
You and I both know the numbers.
The longer she's... gone...

30:01.973 --> 30:03.929
She's my partner.

30:05.176 --> 30:07.432
I should be out there looking for her.

30:07.442 --> 30:10.371
Yeah. You should.

30:10.382 --> 30:13.707
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

30:13.718 --> 30:14.771
No.

30:16.738 --> 30:18.443
What do you want me to say?

30:20.277 --> 30:21.613
I...

30:22.122 --> 30:24.598
I want you to promise...

30:25.493 --> 30:27.692
no matter what happens...

30:28.429 --> 30:31.489
no matter what you have to do,

30:31.499 --> 30:33.632
that you will get her home safe.

30:35.602 --> 30:38.527
- Aaron?
- Yeah?

30:38.538 --> 30:40.105
Thank you.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.951
Auntie Jack.

30:53.854 --> 30:55.846
What are you doing alone?

30:55.856 --> 30:58.047
Huh? Where's your dad?

30:58.057 --> 31:01.284
Is Grandpa Harry really a criminal?

31:01.294 --> 31:03.186
Oh, honey...

31:03.197 --> 31:05.489
I'm so sorry.

31:06.132 --> 31:09.292
He's hurting my mom, isn't he?

31:09.302 --> 31:12.795
We are taking care of it, OK?

31:12.805 --> 31:16.132
Everything is gonna be fine,
I promise you.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.467
Are you gonna kill him?

31:18.477 --> 31:21.312
It's not our job to kill people.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.483
Come. Come here.

31:31.824 --> 31:35.083
Hey, look. There's your dad.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.920
I think they're ready
for you guys to go now.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.756
I'm so sorry about what
I've said. I didn't mean it.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.758
I know that, honey. I know.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.767
It's OK. Shh...

31:50.844 --> 31:53.724
Shouldn't you be at the motel ripping
off Barker's face right about now?

31:53.735 --> 31:57.008
Yeah, I thought so too, but apparently
somebody else thought my skills

31:57.019 --> 32:00.117
were best used here. I need to go
through the chain of evidence.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.344
Yeah, I'm just about to input that now.

32:03.883 --> 32:06.047
It would go faster if
you helped. Just saying.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.583
Fine.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.794
ID 170895564.

32:14.304 --> 32:16.514
My sister has this exact same badge.

32:16.525 --> 32:17.608
What do you mean?

32:17.734 --> 32:22.339
It's for attendance, I think,
or something. I don't remember.

32:22.350 --> 32:24.098
Why would he have a girl's camp badge?

32:24.108 --> 32:26.667
Could've belonged to another victim.

32:26.677 --> 32:28.836
Oh, we should get a list
of names from the camp

32:28.846 --> 32:31.538
and contact anyone who's been in
attendance in the last 20 years.

32:31.548 --> 32:34.708
That's gonna be a hard list to
get. That place closed up shop...

32:34.718 --> 32:37.377
Not enough bad girls
to fill it out, I guess.

32:37.387 --> 32:39.212
What's that supposed to mean?

32:39.222 --> 32:42.382
Camp's called The Right Path for a
reason. It's for troubled teens.

32:42.392 --> 32:45.226
The Right Path?

32:47.263 --> 32:49.898
What... what are you doing?

32:51.934 --> 32:53.993
OK, that's... Yep, we're not
supposed to do that.

32:54.004 --> 32:57.525
Kyle said that Harry told him this book
had something to do with the case,

32:57.536 --> 32:59.814
but with everything that's been
going on, I totally forgot. Look.

32:59.825 --> 33:02.072
This is the page that was
marked with the card.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.744
I saw it when we were
searching the house.

33:03.755 --> 33:06.506
It says, "Come, Little Red Riding
Hood, and when you are going",

33:06.516 --> 33:09.074
walk nicely and quietly
and do not run off the path."

33:09.084 --> 33:11.878
How do I get to the camp?

33:11.888 --> 33:13.548
I don't know. I think
it's off Highway 50.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.705
Ok.

33:31.950 --> 33:33.059
Damn it.

33:34.606 --> 33:36.418
It's the last one. They're not here.

33:36.429 --> 33:38.684
We'll reconvene back at the
station, figure out next steps.

33:38.695 --> 33:41.230
We don't have time for next steps.

33:41.241 --> 33:42.574
Yeah, what?

33:43.051 --> 33:46.243
- It's me. I found Harry's car.
- What? Where?

33:46.254 --> 33:49.004
Outside a cabin at the Right Path Camp,

33:49.015 --> 33:51.774
off the 50. Pretty sure
Stevie's in there.

33:51.785 --> 33:54.907
The Right Path Camp, off
Highway 50! We're on our way.

33:54.918 --> 33:58.946
Wait for backup. Don't go in there
alone, Jack, do you hear me?

33:58.957 --> 34:00.247
Jack!

34:21.835 --> 34:24.958
Oh, Stevie! Oh, my God!

34:24.969 --> 34:27.337
Hey! Hey!

34:31.337 --> 34:33.271
OK, come on. Come on.

34:34.290 --> 34:36.581
OK. OK.

34:43.223 --> 34:45.998
I need an ambulance
at the Right Path Camp

34:46.009 --> 34:48.385
off Highway 50. Hurry, please.
We're detect...

35:13.446 --> 35:17.001
Look at me.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.391
So, what are you gonna do, Bims?

35:30.070 --> 35:31.861
Finish me off?

35:33.390 --> 35:34.937
Can't do that.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.223
You'd be doing it to an unarmed man.

35:38.234 --> 35:40.903
A man who kept me captive.

35:40.913 --> 35:43.339
A man who killed people?

35:44.765 --> 35:46.692
I'll be fine.

35:46.703 --> 35:48.176
You're a cop.

35:48.186 --> 35:51.421
You took an oath. You'd be breaking it.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.918
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

35:58.156 --> 36:00.630
So in the end, you're
no different than me.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.361
Why should I be surprised?

36:07.312 --> 36:08.989
I made you.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.630
My father made me.

36:11.914 --> 36:13.901
Stevie, what are you doing?

36:14.664 --> 36:16.463
He killed my dad.

36:18.125 --> 36:22.008
And he kept me and my mom
in the dark for years,

36:22.019 --> 36:24.226
thinking that the man
we loved abandoned us

36:24.237 --> 36:26.770
without so much as a note.

36:29.618 --> 36:31.685
So yeah, I think I'm gonna kill him.

36:33.982 --> 36:35.095
OK.

36:39.621 --> 36:41.174
OK?

36:41.791 --> 36:44.510
Whatever happens, I'm behind you.

36:45.588 --> 36:48.486
OK? Whatever we need to do,

36:48.496 --> 36:52.256
whatever we need to say, I'll say it.

36:53.221 --> 36:54.492
You will?

36:54.502 --> 36:56.494
Of course.

36:57.526 --> 37:00.119
But I need you to know

37:00.130 --> 37:03.290
that there will be times
when my support won't cut it.

37:03.301 --> 37:04.565
Jack...

37:05.384 --> 37:07.409
Don't talk me down, please.

37:07.420 --> 37:10.276
I'm not. I'm just talking to you.

37:10.951 --> 37:13.104
Because I love you

37:13.487 --> 37:15.838
and because I know you,

37:15.849 --> 37:18.274
Stevie. I do.

37:18.285 --> 37:21.178
And whatever you choose,

37:21.189 --> 37:24.115
I will be there for you,
because no matter what happens,

37:24.126 --> 37:26.226
I know I can live with it.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.993
Can you?

37:41.630 --> 37:43.361
Harry Barker,

37:45.010 --> 37:47.277
you are under arrest

37:47.287 --> 37:49.779
for the murders...

37:49.789 --> 37:52.548
of Nancy Brown,

37:52.558 --> 37:54.751
Wendy Fraser,

37:54.761 --> 37:57.820
Paula King, Brooke Dodson,

37:57.830 --> 38:00.597
Alvin Flowers...

38:02.364 --> 38:04.526
and my dad,

38:05.572 --> 38:08.135
Gene Mailer.

38:25.557 --> 38:27.135
You look rough, Hall.

38:27.146 --> 38:28.799
Yeah?

38:28.810 --> 38:32.033
Then why is it that I still
look better than you, Price?

38:33.932 --> 38:35.361
You had me worried.

38:35.372 --> 38:36.916
How do you think I felt?

38:41.964 --> 38:45.624
Look, uh... I guess
this is as good a time as any.

38:46.244 --> 38:48.314
Stevie! Stevie!

38:52.974 --> 38:55.200
I was so scared I'd never see you again!

38:55.210 --> 38:57.344
I can't lose you, I can't!

38:59.314 --> 39:02.474
- I'm here. Ooh!
- Sorry.

39:02.484 --> 39:05.913
- Are you OK? Did he hurt you?
- I'll live. Where are the kids?

39:05.924 --> 39:08.146
They're meeting us at the
hospital with Helen.

39:08.157 --> 39:09.221
Right.

39:09.455 --> 39:11.482
I can't believe that
bastard did this to you.

39:11.492 --> 39:14.652
- I'll kill that son of a bitch.
- Look, it's over.

39:15.238 --> 39:17.505
That's all that matters.

39:18.933 --> 39:20.933
I love you so much.

39:22.802 --> 39:25.704
I haven't been good to you.
I haven't been...

39:27.875 --> 39:30.501
But we got a second chance, and I...

39:31.471 --> 39:33.080
I will be better.

39:33.377 --> 39:35.347
We'll both be better.

39:42.986 --> 39:44.055
Hey.

39:46.293 --> 39:48.072
I need you to manage the scene.

39:48.083 --> 39:50.241
I wanna go to the hospital,
make sure Stevie's good.

39:50.252 --> 39:51.521
Sounds like a plan.

39:52.221 --> 39:56.125
You know, if you want, I can update
you every hour on how she's doing.

39:57.202 --> 39:58.499
You OK?

39:58.510 --> 40:01.631
Thought we weren't supposed to talk
about personal stuff, you and me.

40:01.641 --> 40:03.474
Yeah, we're not.

40:07.179 --> 40:08.510
Price.

40:09.482 --> 40:10.635
Hey, uh...

40:10.861 --> 40:13.874
Look, if you wanna go to the hospital,
I'll be overseeing from here.

40:13.885 --> 40:15.878
- Is our girl OK?
- Yeah, she's OK.

40:15.888 --> 40:18.714
A little banged up,
but not bad, considering.

40:18.724 --> 40:21.384
Yeah. Yeah. Day like this...

40:21.394 --> 40:24.520
That's what it's all about,
right? Endless nights,

40:24.530 --> 40:26.789
72 hours straight, no break...

40:26.799 --> 40:29.491
This is a moment, this is
what it's all about, I guess.

40:29.501 --> 40:32.869
- Today was a good day.
- Hell of a day.

40:38.358 --> 40:40.068
You're something else, you know that?

40:40.078 --> 40:42.070
I'm surprised you're still here.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.247
I thought you'd be home
in your underwear by now.

40:46.251 --> 40:47.951
You know, we're gonna
miss you around here.

40:47.962 --> 40:51.754
Aww, you mean you're gonna miss me.

40:54.835 --> 40:57.419
Yeah. I'm gonna miss you.

40:57.429 --> 40:59.429
It's been a pleasure, Cooper.

41:01.433 --> 41:03.833
I'll miss you too.

41:06.132 --> 41:07.280
Cooper.

41:08.405 --> 41:10.832
You know how I feel about
relations among staff.

41:10.842 --> 41:14.733
Well, it's a good thing I'm
not your staff anymore, then.

41:15.796 --> 41:18.272
- I'm gonna see if Price needs me.
- Yeah,

41:18.282 --> 41:20.132
- why don't you?
- OK.

41:21.538 --> 41:23.877
I didn't follow orders.

41:24.812 --> 41:25.879
No, you didn't.

41:25.889 --> 41:29.049
I'm sorry. I know I should've listened.

41:30.101 --> 41:33.387
Wow, even I am sick of
hearing me say that.

41:33.397 --> 41:36.456
- Do you know why I hired you?
- Stevie made you?

41:36.999 --> 41:40.059
Because I saw a young detective who
was willing to risk everything

41:40.069 --> 41:42.629
to get the job done, including yourself,

41:42.639 --> 41:45.444
and today I saw that again.

41:47.181 --> 41:49.181
Stevie is alive because of you.

41:50.981 --> 41:52.972
But you don't listen, you're bullheaded

41:52.982 --> 41:55.308
and you have a hell of a lot
to learn about respect.

41:55.318 --> 41:57.543
I don't know how 45 Division's
gonna deal with you.

41:57.553 --> 41:59.437
Well, maybe they'll
straighten me out, huh?

41:59.448 --> 42:00.874
I don't think so.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.849
Which is why I can't, in all good faith,

42:03.860 --> 42:07.218
send you. Not until I've
whipped you into shape.

42:07.229 --> 42:09.787
Wait, does this mean...

42:09.798 --> 42:12.165
Quit dawdling, Cooper,
we've got somewhere to be.

42:17.573 --> 42:20.132
- Stevie.
- I've already told Jono,

42:20.142 --> 42:22.434
I don't need any help
getting to the hospital.

42:22.444 --> 42:24.166
Yeah, the hole in your
arm says otherwise.

42:24.177 --> 42:26.424
Just shut your pretty face
and let us support you.

42:26.435 --> 42:28.944
Do you not need to stay on scene,
make sure you got everything?

42:28.955 --> 42:30.424
Hey, he shot a cop.

42:30.435 --> 42:32.510
If he doesn't go down,
we should all get fired.

42:32.521 --> 42:35.144
Listen to her, she's an expert
on getting fired.

42:35.155 --> 42:37.421
Living the dream.
