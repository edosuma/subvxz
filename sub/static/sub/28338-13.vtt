01:02.210 --> 01:04.380
-Sorry, sorry. I know, I know.
-I've been waiting here forever!

01:04.380 --> 01:06.040
I went the long way.
I just don't like

01:06.040 --> 01:09.460
walking past Globgor at night.
It gives me night terrors.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.790
Oh, brother.
So, what'd ya bring me?

01:11.790 --> 01:14.460
Well, why don't we
just take a little peek?

so good to me?

Special edition, too.
Extra marshmallows.

Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!
Don't wake the baby!

Haven't you learned by now

02:39.830 --> 02:42.170
not to sneak up
on a magical queen?

02:42.170 --> 02:43.620
It's happening again.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.670
Oh, no. What is it this time?

02:46.670 --> 02:49.620
-Marshmallows.
-Aww.

02:49.620 --> 02:53.000
She paired them up
so they wouldn't be lonely!

02:53.000 --> 02:56.750
It's so... adorable!

02:56.750 --> 03:01.790
It's makin' my guts go--
[growling]

03:01.790 --> 03:05.250
And then I get warm.
And then-- and then--

03:05.250 --> 03:07.460
I-- I sweat.
I sweat a lot.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.500
-Oh.
-And then, my-- my eyes

03:09.500 --> 03:11.620
have been welling up a little.

Every time I think I'm over her
and I like someone else,

03:15.040 --> 03:16.330
I get marshmallows.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.250
Do you have a spell
to make my feelings go away?

03:21.250 --> 03:23.670
Oh, sweet baby boy.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.330
No. No, I do not.

03:26.330 --> 03:29.120
But you shouldn't be
in such a rush
to get rid of them.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.620
But they hurt.

03:30.620 --> 03:34.500
Feelings are worth feeling,
even if they hurt.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.620
[clears throat] Now,
if you'll excuse us,

03:36.620 --> 03:38.750
I think Globgor would be
rather embarrassed

03:38.750 --> 03:41.500
to have his teeth brushed
in front of company.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.120
Oh! Oh, of course, yeah.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.790
Uh, sorry, Globgor.

-Hello, Marco.
-Back off!

Relax, Mackie Hand.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.290
Oh, it's you.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.380
I heard your conversation
with Eclipsa,

03:54.380 --> 03:56.540
and I think I might be able
to help with your

03:56.540 --> 03:58.620
embarrassing little problem.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.710
Eh, nope. Don't say it.
Do not--

04:00.710 --> 04:02.170
Hypnotism.

04:02.170 --> 04:05.210
No, Janna! You are not
gonna hypnotize me again!

04:05.210 --> 04:07.620
Aw, come on. I'm just tryin'
to help a friend.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.120
Friends don't hypnotize
each other

04:09.120 --> 04:10.830
and make them hate
their favorite food!

04:10.830 --> 04:13.210
I used to love nachos.

04:13.210 --> 04:16.580
Now the thought of them
makes me-- [retches] --queasy.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.750
Yeah, but it's better for you
this way.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.540
-Besides, ya look good.
-[sighs] Thanks.

04:21.540 --> 04:24.620
But I don't want to have nausea
every time I think of Star.

04:24.620 --> 04:27.580
I just don't want
to have feelings for her
anymore.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.170
Don't worry.
I totally got this.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.670
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-Chicken butt.

What the heck, Janna?!

04:41.460 --> 04:43.960
Don't thank me yet.
Let's see if it worked.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.620
What do you think
of Star's marshmallows now?

04:49.710 --> 04:52.120
They're still adorable.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.880
So, you're telling me
I just wasted 14 hours
of my life?

04:55.880 --> 04:58.080
Ugh. That's so annoying.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.670
Ugh. I know what I have to do.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.580
I just don't wanna do it.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.670
-What's that?
-I gotta--

05:05.670 --> 05:06.960
I gotta tell Star.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.750
And you think
that's a solution?

05:09.750 --> 05:12.040
I'm walkin' around with a bowl
of cereal, here, Janna.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.670
[chuckles] This is gonna
be awkward.

-[puppy barking]
-Oh, my little baby puppy!

05:16.790 --> 05:19.500
Oh, no! It's too cute!

Oh, hey, Marco!
Have you come to say hi

to this little angel
baby puppy?

Star, can-- can you--
put the puppy away?

05:27.250 --> 05:29.670
I-- I have something
to talk to you about.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.620
Oh, OK. Hey, Tom!

05:31.620 --> 05:33.830
Marco's got somethin'
he wants to talk about!

05:33.830 --> 05:34.790
Oh, no!

-[puppies barking]
-Oh, cool.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.080
What do you want
to talk about, buuuudy?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.790
Uh, hey, Tom.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.670
Wait, wait. Just one second.

05:46.670 --> 05:47.670
This should be good.

05:47.670 --> 05:50.960
[stammering] OK! Fine.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.620
Star, this kills me.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.960

My little sweet baby
marshmallow friends?

marshmallow friends!

-What? There's still one more.

-Exactly! Star didn't want
-Exactly! I didn't want

that marshmallow
to get lonely,

-so I gave her a friend.

Now, it's all alone.
How do you not see that?

Uhh, Star...

06:18.330 --> 06:20.750
I'm havin' a problem,

06:20.750 --> 06:22.710
and I think it's you.

06:22.710 --> 06:28.420
I like every single thing
about you.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.460
It's... it's unnatural.

06:31.460 --> 06:35.750
No, Marco.
It's not unnatural.

06:35.750 --> 06:36.750
This should be good.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.920
Look, Tom, Tom!
I'm sorry, dude!

06:38.920 --> 06:40.290
I-- I just needed
to get this off my chest!

06:41.960 --> 06:44.710
It's supernatural.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.750
You're both cursed.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.670
What? What are you
talking about?

06:48.670 --> 06:51.880
[sighs] Remember
the Blood Moon Ball?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.250
Yes...

06:53.250 --> 06:57.250
Right. Well, its actual name
is the Blood Moon Curse.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.380
The curse chooses two souls
to be eternally bound

07:00.380 --> 07:02.830
under the light
of the blood moon.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.920
And I took you, in hopes
that it would choose us,

07:04.920 --> 07:06.580
but it didn't.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.290
It-- it chose
you and Marco instead.

07:09.290 --> 07:13.080
Wait, so we're cursed,
and you knew about it?

07:13.080 --> 07:17.170
Yeah, but I-- I--
I kinda thought you knew, too?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.580
No, Tom. I didn't know.
How would I have known?

07:19.580 --> 07:21.790
Well, I thought
it was pretty clear!

07:21.790 --> 07:24.880
I mean, there was that guy
who explained everything.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.330
The light? Remember the light?
It chose you.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.670
I thought that
was a fun party light!

07:29.670 --> 07:30.920
I didn't know it was cursed!

07:30.920 --> 07:33.750
But you know
you have feelings for Marco!

07:33.750 --> 07:35.620
And I know you have feelings
for Marco.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.170
I mean, where did you think
that came from?

07:37.170 --> 07:39.750
You have feelings for me?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.790
[stammering]
Because of the curse!

07:41.790 --> 07:45.120
Star, I'm sorry.
I was an idiot back then.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.920
W-what can I do
to make it up to you?

07:46.920 --> 07:49.120
How about
get rid of this curse?!

07:49.120 --> 07:51.620
OK, well, my Grandpa Relicor

07:51.620 --> 07:53.210
was the one to tell me
about the blood moon.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.330
Well, then, let's go
talk with him.

07:55.330 --> 07:58.380
No, wait, wait, wait. He's never
gonna talk about it with us.

07:58.380 --> 08:01.040
But he's got a study room
with books on everything,

08:01.040 --> 08:03.000
so let's start there.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.880
Fine. Let's just hurry up
and break this thing.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.880
Right, Marco?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.920
Marco, what's wrong?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.830
I just... can't believe
that all this

08:13.830 --> 08:15.880
has been because of
some dumb curse.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.920
It-- it's just--
[sighs] --confusing.

08:18.920 --> 08:23.880
Hey! You're my best friend,
and no curse is ever
gonna change that.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.920
But if this thing
is messing with us,

08:25.920 --> 08:28.670
let's smash it
to a billion pieces!

08:28.670 --> 08:31.670
Yeah! Let's go destroy
our feelings!

08:34.830 --> 08:39.290
Whoa! Your grandpa's study
is like my dream home.

08:39.290 --> 08:41.710
Yeah. It's his little
man cave.

08:41.710 --> 08:45.080
Little? He has, like,
a billion books in here!

08:45.080 --> 08:47.620
Good thing he has a computer
to search it all with.

08:47.620 --> 08:51.040
I love it when the elderly
embrace technology.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.290
It says here that moon curses
are easily broken!

08:54.290 --> 08:57.000
"The accursed simply needs
to stand in the exact spot

08:57.000 --> 09:00.620
where the curse was placed,
at the exact same cycle
in the lunar calendar,

09:00.620 --> 09:03.040
and when the moon
hits its apex..." [gasps]

09:03.040 --> 09:04.790
"...the curse
shall be removed!"

09:04.790 --> 09:07.460
Oh, easy! We can totally
do that.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.880
When's the next blood moon?

09:08.880 --> 09:12.880
Uh, around 665 years from now.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.830
Oh, right.
You don't live that long.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.920
I wanted to start a family.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.080
Fall in love. [sighs]

09:20.080 --> 09:23.880
What's the point if this curse
is making all the decisions?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.670
-[shrieks]
-Wha-- ha-- what--

09:25.670 --> 09:26.880
What the heck is this thing?!

09:26.880 --> 09:29.040
Oh, no! Grandpa Relicor,
calm down!

09:29.040 --> 09:30.540
Get him off, get him off,
get him off!

supposed to be in here...

09:37.920 --> 09:38.920
[shrieks]

09:38.920 --> 09:41.330
But I used the Blood Moon Curse.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.750
[inquisitive grunt]

09:42.750 --> 09:45.500
I used it, but it chose
my friends.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.710
Now I really messed up
their lives.

09:47.710 --> 09:49.880
And we can't find a way
to break the curse.

that I've doomed you both.

the Severing Stone

10:07.080 --> 10:08.580
might be able to help us.

"The Severing Stone.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.120
emotional, or even magical.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.000
The Stone can be found
at the deepest depths
of the Underworld."

10:24.000 --> 10:26.500
Aw, man, this day
gets better and better.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.750
[shrieks]

10:27.750 --> 10:29.710
Uh, Relicor says
he'll guide us

10:29.710 --> 10:32.040
to the Severing Stone,
'cause he's my

10:32.040 --> 10:33.540
grandpapapapapa

10:33.540 --> 10:35.000
papapapapapapapa

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
papapaaaaaaaa.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.960
OK...

10:45.080 --> 10:46.330
Wait, is he just
staying up there--

10:46.330 --> 10:49.790
-[shrieking]
-[Marco screaming]

10:49.790 --> 10:52.790

-[Relicor vocalizing]

10:57.040 --> 10:59.620
[vocalizing]

10:59.620 --> 11:01.000
He's saying to back up.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.040
-[vocalizing]
-What?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.920
[organ music playing]

11:10.920 --> 11:13.170
[elevator dings]

11:13.170 --> 11:14.710
You know, this elevator

11:14.710 --> 11:16.580
might not be worth
burnin' a shelf of books

11:16.580 --> 11:17.920
every time
you wanna use it.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.290
[Relicor vocalizes]

11:19.290 --> 11:20.960
-[Marco] Just sayin'.

-[whistling]

11:28.170 --> 11:31.380
[chuckling]

11:31.380 --> 11:33.120
Why are you a lil' giggly boy
over there?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.830
Oh! Oh, I-- I--
I forgot I had

11:35.830 --> 11:38.000
this cereal bowl in my pocket.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.120
And, uh, the cereal's all--
all mushy.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.120
[both]
Tom!

11:41.120 --> 11:42.210
What did I do?

11:42.210 --> 11:43.790
You're an elevator whistler!

11:43.790 --> 11:47.170
And you were doing
that little thing
we talked about.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.040
Mm, that little
stretchy yoga thing.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.500
In public. That I hate.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.580
So, what? We gonna--

11:53.580 --> 11:56.290
We just dump on Tom now?!
Is that it?

11:56.290 --> 11:58.620
No, it's just,
when you do that--

11:58.620 --> 11:59.960
[grumbling]

11:59.960 --> 12:01.330
-[elevator stops]
-[all grunt]

12:01.330 --> 12:02.880
We stopped.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.380
[dings]

12:04.380 --> 12:06.120
-[Star] What?
-[Marco] Where are we?

12:06.120 --> 12:07.670
[vocalizes]

12:07.670 --> 12:09.210
Uh, he, uh...

12:09.210 --> 12:11.210
He says it's not
the right floor.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.040
[vocalizes]

12:13.210 --> 12:14.920
[vocalizing]

12:14.920 --> 12:17.250
Well, this is as far
as I go. Sorry.

12:17.250 --> 12:21.580
-It's the way it is.
-[vocalizing]

12:21.580 --> 12:24.670
-Uh, sir, do not--
do not do that.
-[sawing]

12:24.670 --> 12:26.460
[vocalizing]

12:26.460 --> 12:28.580
Everything-- everything
you're doing is being recorded.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.000
[all screaming]

12:32.000 --> 12:33.380
Super Inflatable
Bounce House Blast!

[dings]

12:38.460 --> 12:40.790
[groaning]

12:45.120 --> 12:47.120
Wow.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.670
That must be
the Severing Stone!

12:49.670 --> 12:51.710
[vocalizing]

12:55.120 --> 12:57.210
You want me to translate that
for ya, Marco?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.620
No. It's fine, Tom.
I think I got it. Thanks.

12:59.620 --> 13:02.170
Hey, shut up. Look.

13:17.210 --> 13:22.420
Oh, great demon thing!
What is it that you want
from us?

13:22.420 --> 13:24.960
Wait, are you serious? Ugh.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.040
Isn't it painfully obvious
that this creep is some sort
of bridge troll?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.330
He just came up
out of the ground
to block our path.

13:30.330 --> 13:33.920
Over a very rickety bridge,
I might add.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.290
Now there's gonna be
some crazy thing
we gotta do to pay the toll.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.880
Feed him a goat or something.
There's always a thing!

13:38.880 --> 13:41.080
Any second, this creep's
gonna be all like,

13:41.080 --> 13:44.250
"If you wanna cross my bridge,
you must, uh, uh,

13:44.250 --> 13:46.670
uh, uh, lift this couch

13:46.670 --> 13:49.750
that magically appeared
up-- up these 30 stairs!"

13:49.750 --> 13:51.500
And then the five of us
are gonna try to lift

13:51.500 --> 13:53.290
this stupid thing
up the stairs,
and it's not gonna work,

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
and the creepy guy's
gonna be all like,

13:54.750 --> 13:57.170
oh, uh, sorry.
What-- what's your name?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.080
Abraxacan.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.170
Thanks. Then Abraxacan
is gonna be all like,

14:01.170 --> 14:02.750
oh, and I know
this is a bad impression,

14:02.750 --> 14:07.330
"The couch can only be lifted
by the right pairing!"

14:07.330 --> 14:10.120
Ugh. And we're gonna be
all exhausted and stuff.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.330
And we're gonna be like,
"Duh! It has to be me and Star

14:13.330 --> 14:15.120
who lift the couch!"
Just us.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.540
Because our souls are bonded.

14:16.540 --> 14:19.750
Bound.

14:19.750 --> 14:23.000
Thank you. Bound. Together.
Anyway. [sighs]

14:23.000 --> 14:26.250
Grab an end, Star.
Let's get this thing over with.

14:26.250 --> 14:30.380
Um, I don't know if all that
was completely obvious.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.620
To me. Maybe I'm alone.

14:32.620 --> 14:36.120
[laughs nervously] No way.
This thing's got a bed
inside of it.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.210
(chuckling) Oh, yeah.
It's gonna weigh a ton.

14:39.210 --> 14:41.120
-[grunting]
-[Vexicor] Stop!

14:43.420 --> 14:45.120
[exhaling menacingly]

14:46.580 --> 14:48.500
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:52.710 --> 14:56.080
[slurping]

14:56.080 --> 14:58.420
[exhales]

14:58.420 --> 15:03.170
Abraxacan, what are
these people doing here?

15:03.170 --> 15:05.620
They're moving the couch.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.120
I can see that.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.830
But why are they
moving the couch?

15:11.830 --> 15:14.330
To get across the bridge.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.120
Right. But if they want
to cross the bridge,

15:17.120 --> 15:19.540
they have to fight us
to the death!

15:19.540 --> 15:21.670
Um, yeah, I just thought

15:21.670 --> 15:23.580
they'd do that
after they moved--

15:23.580 --> 15:25.670
Please stop talking.
Please stop talking.

15:25.670 --> 15:28.670
I mean, somebody's
gotta move the couch.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.790
Well, hire movers!

15:30.790 --> 15:33.460
Just like everybody else! Ugh.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.790
Just lower the tower.

15:35.790 --> 15:37.210
This is a total mess.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.250
Fine.

15:40.710 --> 15:43.040
You forgot to close the door.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.040
What?

15:45.420 --> 15:46.920
I have no idea
what just happened,

15:46.920 --> 15:48.500
but let's go before they
change their minds.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.790
[panting] This bridge
is a death trap.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.880
[both exclaiming]

16:00.880 --> 16:02.880
[all exclaiming]

16:02.880 --> 16:05.080
Aah! Help! Help me!

16:05.080 --> 16:06.290
Janna!

16:06.290 --> 16:07.290
No, I'm kidding.

16:07.290 --> 16:08.710
I have really strong fingers.

16:08.710 --> 16:11.290
I had ya fooled, though.
You should have seen yo faces!

16:11.290 --> 16:13.080
[chuckles]

16:18.080 --> 16:20.250
So, that's the Severing Stone?

translating for us?

I don't speak Severing Stone.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.880
[shrieks]

16:46.880 --> 16:50.460
Oh! He says the Stone
is asking why we're here.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.290
[clears throat]
Oh, Severing Stone,

16:53.290 --> 16:55.330
we wish to sever our souls,

16:55.330 --> 16:58.500
which were bound
in the light of the blood moon.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.250
[plays notes]

17:01.250 --> 17:02.330

17:02.330 --> 17:04.120
He says that'll be easy!

17:04.120 --> 17:05.620
Just hop up on the stage.

17:05.620 --> 17:06.960
[both]
Let's do this.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.250
[panicked vocalizing]

17:08.250 --> 17:09.250
-Huh?
-Huh? Relicor?

17:09.250 --> 17:10.620
[vocalizing continues]

17:10.620 --> 17:12.750
Gramps, what are you doing?

17:15.420 --> 17:19.250

17:19.250 --> 17:21.710
OK, what was that all about?

17:21.710 --> 17:24.250
[vocalizing]

17:24.250 --> 17:26.250
Relicor says he came
to the Severing Stone

17:26.250 --> 17:28.120
once before,
thousands of years ago--

17:28.120 --> 17:29.960
[vocalizes]

17:29.960 --> 17:31.500
--because he wanted
to sever his soul

17:31.500 --> 17:33.580
-from my great-grandma, but--
-[vocalizes]

17:33.580 --> 17:35.500
--but to do so,
he had to sacrifice the memory

17:35.500 --> 17:37.500
of the moment
they first fell in love.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.920
-Now, he can never have
that memory back.
-[Relicor sobbing]

17:39.920 --> 17:41.710
And he says he's regretted it
ever since.

17:41.710 --> 17:43.080
[vocalizes]

17:43.080 --> 17:47.380
The Stone says
the severing is permanent.

17:47.380 --> 17:49.750
But that's cool, 'cause that's--
that's what we all want, right?

17:54.250 --> 17:55.830
Janna, would you mind
holding this?

17:55.830 --> 17:57.830
No, I'm cool.

17:57.830 --> 17:58.830
I got you, bro.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.380
Thanks. Tom.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.670
So, we have to sacrifice
the memory

18:04.670 --> 18:06.670
of the moment
our souls were bonded.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.790
-When we danced.
-Yeah.

18:08.790 --> 18:11.670
Ok, so...

18:11.670 --> 18:14.170
Like this, I guess?

18:14.170 --> 18:16.000
I mean, I think so.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.080
Hey! Hey, that dance
was meant for me!

18:19.080 --> 18:21.290
[laughs] I'm just kidding.

18:21.290 --> 18:24.290
Are we sure
this is what we're--

18:24.290 --> 18:25.500
[plays note]

18:25.500 --> 18:26.830
[both]
Whoa.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.420
[both]
It's the Blood Moon Ball!

18:34.420 --> 18:36.420
Oh, my gosh,
outfits and everything!

18:36.420 --> 18:38.330
Are you guys seeing this?

18:41.380 --> 18:44.750
Wow. Wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.420
Marco, I think we're
in our memories.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.540
[music playing]

18:50.540 --> 18:52.750
I guess we gotta go for it.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
[gasps]

18:56.460 --> 18:58.420
Aww, you look so cute
in your mask.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.080
Uh, naw.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.880
[Star] Oh, right!
I also never told you

19:01.880 --> 19:03.920
you had corn chip crumbs
on your tie.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.460
-[Marco] Aw.
-[Star laughs]

19:06.460 --> 19:09.290
[laughs] Well,
that's embarrassing.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.080
[sighs] Uh, this
would have been the part

19:11.080 --> 19:13.500
where Tom shoved me
halfway across the ballroom.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.460
This feels... new.

19:18.670 --> 19:21.960
Where have you been hiding
these dance moves, Diaz?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.620
Nowhere. I mean,
I just keep on dancin',

19:24.620 --> 19:26.500
you know?
That's what Grandma said.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.960
"Just keep dancing,
even if you look silly."

19:35.380 --> 19:36.540
[both laughing]

19:36.540 --> 19:37.710
Aww. [laughs]

19:44.500 --> 19:47.500
Marco, I'm really scared.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.080
Don't worry. It's gonna work.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.670
That's what I'm scared of.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.670
I-- I-- I don't want
my destiny determined

19:54.670 --> 19:56.580
by some creepy curse,

19:56.580 --> 19:57.580
but...

19:59.500 --> 20:01.290
I like this.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.250
Yeah? So do I.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.290
What if it was never
the blood moon?

20:10.290 --> 20:12.960
[music shutting down]

20:14.250 --> 20:15.750
[both groaning]

20:16.920 --> 20:18.620
-[both] Aah!
-[plays note]

20:18.620 --> 20:19.620

20:19.620 --> 20:21.790
He says it is done.

20:21.790 --> 20:24.040
W-w-wait. What happened?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.790
You, like, turned around once,
and that was it.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.500
I don't know.
I feel like I just woke up

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
from, like, a weird nap.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.750
Yeah, we were
at the Blood Moon Ball,

20:33.750 --> 20:36.460
and we were dancing,
and then...

20:36.460 --> 20:38.080
W-what were we just doing?

20:38.080 --> 20:40.830
Yeah, I-- I don't remember.

20:40.830 --> 20:42.580
How do we know it even worked?

20:42.580 --> 20:45.040
Well, here.
The cornshmallows.

20:45.040 --> 20:49.080
Do these cornshmallows
give you any feelings?

20:51.250 --> 20:54.330
Ehh. I just see

20:54.330 --> 20:56.420
two gross pieces of cereal!

20:56.420 --> 20:58.120
What about when you look at me?

21:00.670 --> 21:05.420
I see... my best friend.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.500
Me, too.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.000
Whoo! Ho ho!

21:09.000 --> 21:11.500
Oh, well now things
are only a little awkward!

21:11.500 --> 21:13.250
Instead of very awkward,
which it was,

21:13.250 --> 21:14.580
for, like, a year.
[shudders]

21:14.580 --> 21:17.120
I felt so much guilt
every single day.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.920
Tom, you should have.
But it's OK.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.330
Let's just get outta here.

21:23.330 --> 21:24.960
[Janna cackling]

21:24.960 --> 21:25.960
Janna?

21:25.960 --> 21:27.500
I did it! I got my soul

21:27.500 --> 21:29.670
severed from itself.
Whoo! [laughs]

21:29.670 --> 21:32.710
What?! Oh, Janna, come on,
why would you do that?

21:32.710 --> 21:34.790
Now I have two souls.
I'm pretty much a demon.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.790
Uh, Janna, it-- it doesn't
work like that.

21:37.790 --> 21:41.750
Yeah, now you just have
two halves of the same soul.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.580
So I'm half-demon.
Still counts.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.880

-[Marco screams]

21:45.880 --> 21:49.330
OK, you know, I will be
