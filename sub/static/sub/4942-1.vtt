Game over.

1:34:49.601 --> 1:34:51.011
Guess what.

It's overtime.

I might not be a hero,
but I'm certainly not a killer.

1:36:22.777 --> 1:36:24.153
You know...

1:36:25.113 --> 1:36:26.944
...Once Laurel's boys start talking...

1:36:27.115 --> 1:36:29.902
...we'll be able to wrap up
these murder cases pretty easy.

1:36:31.953 --> 1:36:35.445
And if Patience is back in her cell
by tomorrow morning...

1:36:35.915 --> 1:36:38.998
...it'll be awfully tough to prove
that she was Catwoman.

1:36:41.463 --> 1:36:43.044

Delicious, thank you.

You know, the strawberry was good too.

PATIENCE: The day/died
was the day I started to live.

1:37:33.890 --> 1:37:37.803
In my old life, I longed for someone
to see what was special in me.

1:37:38.061 --> 1:37:42.725
You did, and for that
you'll always be in my heart.

1:37:42.982 --> 1:37:46.065
But what I really needed
was for me to see it.

1:37:46.486 --> 1:37:48.101
And now I do.

1:37:48.446 --> 1:37:50.027
You're a good man, Tom.

1:37:50.198 --> 1:37:54.817
But you live in a world that has no place
for someone like me.

1:37:55.078 --> 1:37:58.696
You see, sometimes I'm good.
Oh, I'm very good.

1:37:58.873 --> 1:38:02.741
But sometimes I'm bad.
But only as bad as I wanna be.

1:38:02.919 --> 1:38:04.455
Freedom is power.

1:38:04.629 --> 1:38:10.215
To live a life untamed and unafraid
is the gift that I've been given...

1:38:10.385 --> 1:38:13.673
...and so my journey begins.
