10:16.380 --> 10:18.120
and I need to be there.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.250
No, KC,
you don't understand.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.120
My interview with
the Fashion Institute
of Technology

10:21.120 --> 10:23.250
is in two days,
and if I don't graduate--

10:23.250 --> 10:25.040
Marisa, I'm sorry,

10:25.040 --> 10:26.460
you've got to handle
this one on your own, okay?

10:28.380 --> 10:30.170
Okay, yeah, fine, fine.

10:30.170 --> 10:32.210
Don't worry about me.

10:32.210 --> 10:34.120
I'll handle it
all on my own.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.460
I don't need anyone
else's help, so...

10:36.460 --> 10:39.120
[chuckles]

10:39.120 --> 10:41.120
Hi, it's Marisa.
I need your help.

10:44.380 --> 10:47.250
Well, unfortunately,
we still don't have
the distribution list.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.540
And more importantly,
we still have no idea
who The Mask is.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.120
Seems like The Mask
could be the key
to this whole thing.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.120
Actually, we might have
someone on our side

10:54.120 --> 10:56.170
who knows who The Mask is.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.380
Brady!

11:05.250 --> 11:07.170
Take it easy, Ernie.

11:07.170 --> 11:08.500
I'm on your side now,
remember?

11:08.500 --> 11:12.210
No. What I do remember is,
you're a butt.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.330
Come on, Ernie.

11:14.330 --> 11:16.580
Don't call him a butt.
Thank you.

11:16.580 --> 11:18.380
Call him a jerk
or a liar

11:18.380 --> 11:20.330
or an untrustworthy,
two-faced piece of garbage!

11:22.080 --> 11:23.580
Guys, guys, do not
call him names, okay?

11:23.580 --> 11:25.330
We need this lowlife,
good-for-nothing

11:25.330 --> 11:27.250
snot-faced chump to help.

11:29.170 --> 11:31.210
Now, Brady, when you
were with The Alternate,

11:31.210 --> 11:34.380
did you ever hear them
refer to anyone as The Mask?

11:34.380 --> 11:36.210
Nope,
not that I can remember.

11:36.210 --> 11:37.540
Oh, come on!
How can we trust him?

11:37.540 --> 11:39.540
Everything that comes
out of his mouth

11:39.540 --> 11:41.460
is either
a lie or a fart,

11:41.460 --> 11:44.210
because you're a butt!

11:44.210 --> 11:46.540
Okay, look,
I know that I did
a lot of bad things

11:46.540 --> 11:48.290
while I was
with The Alternate,

11:48.290 --> 11:51.120
but I'm working with you
now, not against you.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.250
And if you don't believe me,

11:54.250 --> 11:56.580
they give me
a lie detector test,
like, every 45 minutes.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.460
And if he fails,
we'll eliminate him.

11:59.460 --> 12:00.460
What?

12:00.460 --> 12:02.460
[laughs]
I'm joking.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.210
[silently]
I'm not.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.540
The good news is,
Brady has come up
with a new way

12:07.540 --> 12:09.540
to get
the distribution list.

12:09.540 --> 12:12.500
We've duplicated
the Bishops' laptop.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.460
KC, we just need you
to get back in the house

12:14.460 --> 12:15.580
and switch the two.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.250
I get it.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.290
So, when the Bishops
type their security password

12:20.290 --> 12:21.670
into the duplicate laptop,

12:21.670 --> 12:23.580
it will remotely send it
to The Organization,

12:23.580 --> 12:25.290
and we'll have
their password.

12:25.290 --> 12:26.290
Exactly.

12:26.290 --> 12:27.420
But aren't
they gonna notice

12:27.420 --> 12:29.210
there's no actual data
on the laptop?

12:29.210 --> 12:31.250
No, don't worry,
the duplicate mirrors theirs,

12:31.250 --> 12:33.580
so whatever they see,
we see, and vice versa.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.500
Hey, this could
actually work.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.330
Wait, you thought
of this, Brady?
Yep.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.500
Good work,
you moronic, slime-
sucking bottom feeder.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.330
Hey!

12:42.330 --> 12:44.580
I'll be nice
with you when this plan
actually works.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.210
[Kira's voice]
Well, there's no one

12:51.210 --> 12:53.580
I'd rather conduct
an invasive IRS audit with

12:53.580 --> 12:55.670
than you, Sugar Bear.

12:58.580 --> 13:01.620
Hey, sweetheart,
how would you like
to have a smoothie?

13:03.380 --> 13:05.460
[blender whirrs]

13:05.460 --> 13:07.290
Okay, this is working.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.380
The Bishops totally
think you're us,

13:09.380 --> 13:11.330
but if I had to
give you one note,

13:11.330 --> 13:14.290
you've kind of got
the Coopers sounding
a little boring.

13:15.290 --> 13:16.460
So, what I'm hearing is,

13:16.460 --> 13:18.210
I've captured
your essence perfectly.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.380
What? I ran out
of stuff to talk about.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.380
You watch that Houseboos
show all day long.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.420
You should know plenty
about fake drama.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.500
Everything
on that show is real.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.580
Well... except for
Chantal's lips.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.620
No one knows what's
going on with them.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.330
Make something up!

13:41.710 --> 13:43.500
[Craig's voice]
Honey,

13:43.500 --> 13:45.750
I'm going to go upstairs
and take a quick shower.

13:45.750 --> 13:49.330
[Kira's voice] Okay.
I'll go get dinner started.

13:49.330 --> 13:50.500
[imitates knock on door]

13:50.500 --> 13:54.500
[Kira's voice] Hmm.
I wasn't expecting anyone.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.670
[John's voice]
Hello, Kira.

13:55.670 --> 13:58.580
[Kira's voice] John!
What are you doing here?

13:58.580 --> 14:00.580
We're not having
a plumbing problem.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.420
[John's voice]
I'm not here about your toilet.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.710
I love you--
truly, madly, deeply.

14:07.710 --> 14:11.420
[Kira's voice] But,
John, I'm a married woman!

14:11.420 --> 14:12.670
[John's voice]
I know.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.670
You're just married
to the wrong guy.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.420
[Craig's voice]
Kira,

14:17.420 --> 14:18.790
do you know where--

14:18.790 --> 14:22.540
What is John the plumber
doing here?

14:22.540 --> 14:23.710
[Kira's voice, gasping]
Craig!

14:23.710 --> 14:24.710
[Craig's voice]
John!

14:24.710 --> 14:26.380
[John's voice]
Kira!

14:26.380 --> 14:29.380
[Kira's voice]
Craig! Oh, Craig!

14:31.380 --> 14:34.540
I knew there was something
sketchy about that Kira.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.500
What, and Craig
isn't annoying? Ohh!

14:36.500 --> 14:38.540
No wonder
she's looking for love
in all the wrong places!

14:38.540 --> 14:39.750
Hoo hoo hoo!

14:42.540 --> 14:44.420
[knock on door]

14:44.420 --> 14:45.620
Hey.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.380
Hey, buddy! I was just
thinking I'd come over

14:48.380 --> 14:49.620
and we'd watch a movie.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.540
Okay, sure. Yeah,
I'm always in the mood
for a good movie.

14:51.540 --> 14:52.620
Oh, perfect.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.750
So, how about you
go to the kitchen

14:54.750 --> 14:56.580
and make us some popcorn,

14:56.580 --> 14:58.580
and make sure
every kernel is popped.

14:58.580 --> 14:59.710
Okay, sure.
Sounds good.

14:59.710 --> 15:00.710
No rush.

15:00.710 --> 15:02.750
[soft chuckle]

15:06.500 --> 15:08.580
Sorry, uh, we're
all out of popcorn.

15:08.580 --> 15:10.580
Oh, okay, uh,

15:10.580 --> 15:12.830
well, you know,
anything salty will do, right?

15:12.830 --> 15:15.750
Uh, how about
some crackers, some chips,

15:15.750 --> 15:18.580
maybe a salt shaker?

15:18.580 --> 15:20.420
I think we have
some pretzels.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.540
Pretzels work.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.330
[chuckles]

15:30.420 --> 15:32.500
So, uh, what movie
are we gonna watch?

15:32.500 --> 15:34.750
Um... [clears throat]
Short one. [chuckles]

15:40.880 --> 15:42.460
Did you get the laptop?

15:42.460 --> 15:43.670
[chuckles] Mom,

15:43.670 --> 15:45.710
I have toppled corrupt
foreign governments

15:45.710 --> 15:47.710
and still gotten my math
homework in on time.

15:47.710 --> 15:50.620
I think I can handle
a switch-out of a laptop.

15:50.620 --> 15:51.710
Piece of cake.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.540
That's my girl.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.830
Hey, did you say
you got cake?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.620
No, Dad, there's no cake.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.540
Can we please
forget about the cake

15:59.540 --> 16:01.380
and concentrate
on the job at hand?

16:02.460 --> 16:03.500
Do your thing, Ernie.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.790
[device beeps]

16:09.790 --> 16:11.880
The shadowing device
is activated.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.790
Now all we have to do
is wait for the Bishops

16:13.790 --> 16:15.790
to log in on the computer
KC left for them,

16:15.790 --> 16:18.710
and we'll have full access
to all their files.

16:18.710 --> 16:22.790
[soft beeping, trilling]

16:22.790 --> 16:24.420
I'm just saying,
there's plenty of time

16:24.420 --> 16:25.790
for somebody to run out
and get some cake.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.710
Look, if I don't
pass English,

16:32.710 --> 16:33.920
then I can't go
to the Fashion Institute,

16:33.920 --> 16:35.580
and then I'll
just be a slacker

16:35.580 --> 16:36.710
who never did anything
with her life,

16:36.710 --> 16:37.830
and I've already
done that for 17 years,

16:37.830 --> 16:39.750
so please help me!

16:41.710 --> 16:44.580
You want me to tutor you
in English?

16:44.580 --> 16:45.880
Eww, no!

16:47.670 --> 16:49.460
I want you to hack
into the school's
computer system

16:49.460 --> 16:50.880
and change my grade.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.750
Well, I could do that,

16:52.750 --> 16:54.920
or I could actually
help you pass.

16:54.920 --> 16:58.540
Option "A," please,
with extra "hacky" sauce.

16:58.540 --> 16:59.750
Come on, Marisa.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.750
It's never
too late to change.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.540
I mean, look at me.

17:03.540 --> 17:04.750
I'm working with
The Organization

17:04.750 --> 17:06.670
trying to help
bring down The Alternate.

17:06.670 --> 17:09.540
I never thought I'd be
doing that a year ago.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.710
If I can change,
you can change.

17:11.710 --> 17:12.880
I have changed.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.670
My interview at F.I.T.
is tomorrow.

17:14.670 --> 17:15.790
That's why
this is so important.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.750
Okay, I have an idea,

17:18.750 --> 17:21.620
but it may involve you
doing some actual work.

17:21.620 --> 17:22.830
Do I have to?
[scoffs]

17:22.830 --> 17:23.960
I cannot wait
till I get into college,

17:23.960 --> 17:25.620
and then
I don't have to worry

17:25.620 --> 17:27.620
about doing schoolwork
anymore.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.620
Guys, we finally have
the password.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.580
We're in.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.830
Did you find the weapons
distribution list?

17:37.830 --> 17:40.540
There's nothing here!

17:40.540 --> 17:42.620
Great. Now we're
back to square one.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.750
We have no distribution list,

17:44.750 --> 17:46.830
and we don't know
who The Mask is.

17:46.830 --> 17:50.540
That's why
we're going to start
doing things my way.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.750
Isn't your way
just when you yell
and we do the work?

17:53.750 --> 17:54.750
That's right!

17:54.750 --> 17:55.920
First thing
tomorrow morning,

17:55.920 --> 17:57.000
we are taking down
the Bishops,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.580
and by "we," I mean you!

18:01.540 --> 18:02.830
Okay, except for Amy.

18:02.830 --> 18:06.580
The only thing she's guilty of
is questionable breath.

18:06.580 --> 18:07.790
I know I used that
as an excuse,

18:07.790 --> 18:09.620
but, seriously,
sometimes it smells

18:09.620 --> 18:12.920
like a skunk crawled
in her mouth and died.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.830
It's true. There's
no evidence to show

18:14.830 --> 18:16.920
that Amy has anything to do
with her family business.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.710
At least let me get
Amy out of the house

18:18.710 --> 18:20.540
before you bust
Mitch and Danielle.

18:20.540 --> 18:21.750
I mean, it's just cruel
for her to have to watch

18:21.750 --> 18:23.710
her parents be dragged
away in handcuffs.

18:23.710 --> 18:24.880
Absolutely not.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.830
We can't take any chance
at tipping them off.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.920
[sighs] Well,
do what you gotta do.

18:33.620 --> 18:34.920
And I'll do
what I gotta do.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.960
[John's voice]
Kira, I won't lose you.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.620
I love you.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.880
[Kira's voice]
And I love the way you fix
our garbage disposal.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.040
But I also love Craig.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.830
[Craig's voice]
You heard her, John.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.540
Get out!

18:55.710 --> 18:57.620
[John's voice]
If I can't have you, Kira,

18:57.620 --> 18:58.960
I'll go mad!

18:58.960 --> 19:00.960
[Craig's voice]
John, no!

19:00.960 --> 19:03.580
Put down that plunger!

19:03.580 --> 19:05.830
[blows landing,
objects smashing]

19:08.880 --> 19:11.830
That John is a maniac!

19:11.830 --> 19:13.710
Should we be
calling the cops?

19:13.710 --> 19:15.080
Okay, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.670
Isn't this all just
a little over the top?

19:17.670 --> 19:20.000
I mean, is it possible
that they really are spies

19:20.000 --> 19:21.960
and they know that
we've bugged their house?

19:21.960 --> 19:23.670
No! No way!

19:23.670 --> 19:25.880
How could they work
together as spies?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.960
They can't even make
their marriage work!

19:30.000 --> 19:32.620
[Craig's voice]
So, who's it going
to be, Kira?

19:32.620 --> 19:34.790
Me, or the plumber?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I guess I overreacted.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.580
Shh!

19:39.580 --> 19:42.670
Kira is about to make
her big choice!

19:48.960 --> 19:51.670
[singsong]
Guess what!

19:51.670 --> 19:52.790
I just spoke
to my English teacher,

19:52.790 --> 19:54.080
and she said
she'd agree to pass me

19:54.080 --> 19:55.880
if I do an essay
for extra credit.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.670
That's great!
I know. In fact,

19:58.670 --> 19:59.920
she was so happy
that I was making an effort

19:59.920 --> 20:01.790
that she cried
actual tears of joy,

20:01.790 --> 20:03.040
and she said,
"Trust me,

20:03.040 --> 20:05.710
no one wants you
to graduate more than I do!"

20:07.620 --> 20:08.790
Look, I'm really glad
you convinced me

20:08.790 --> 20:09.920
to do the right thing.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.040
Thank you, Brady.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.880
You're welcome.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.000
You're a good person,
Marisa,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.710
and I'm sorry for the way
that I treated you.

20:18.710 --> 20:19.880
You didn't deserve that.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.040
Oh, um, yeah.
Apology accepted.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.620
[chuckles]
Look, I have to go.

20:26.620 --> 20:27.790
Thank you, again.

20:27.790 --> 20:28.830
Yeah.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.170
[cell phone beeping]

20:40.170 --> 20:43.000
Um, KC needs my help.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.920
Um, anyway, thank you.
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.750
Bye.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.920
So, what are we gonna do--?
[device beeping]

20:53.920 --> 20:55.120
Anti-bugging device,

20:55.120 --> 20:56.960
just in case
they're listening in.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.920
So, what are we gonna do
about the Coopers?

20:58.920 --> 21:01.000
I still think
they could be spies!

21:01.000 --> 21:03.080
I say
we get out of town now.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.670
Why take the chance?

21:07.880 --> 21:10.960
Oh, we're not going anywhere.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.790
You guys are being
totally paranoid.

21:13.790 --> 21:15.040
Amy.

21:16.170 --> 21:17.790
I just think--

21:17.790 --> 21:19.880
No one told you
to think, Mitch.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.960
Trust me,
KC and the Coopers
are not spies.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.790
I've spent enough time
in their house

21:27.790 --> 21:29.710
protecting my cover
to know.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.880
Okay, so what do you
think we should do?

21:31.880 --> 21:34.120
We stick to the plan,
Danielle.

21:36.210 --> 21:38.710
No one goes anywhere
until all the weapons

21:38.710 --> 21:40.830
have been distributed.
Am I clear?

21:40.830 --> 21:41.960
Yes, Amy.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.880
Just be careful
around KC.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.120
Don't worry.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.120
If I get the slightest sense
she's onto us,

21:47.120 --> 21:49.040
I'll be happy
to eliminate her.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.960
Now go do something useful!

21:54.040 --> 21:55.790
[doorbell rings]

21:55.790 --> 21:56.960
Who is it?

21:56.960 --> 21:58.170
Uh, it's KC!

22:00.830 --> 22:02.170
I'm coming!

22:08.920 --> 22:10.040
Hey!

22:10.040 --> 22:11.830
Surprise!

22:11.830 --> 22:13.830
What are you guys
doing here so early?

22:13.830 --> 22:15.080
Well, we thought
that we'd go on

22:15.080 --> 22:17.040
a little road trip to...

22:17.040 --> 22:19.040
[both]
New York City!

22:19.040 --> 22:20.920
What are you guys
talking about?

22:20.920 --> 22:23.120
Marisa has
her interview at F.I.T.,

22:23.120 --> 22:25.120
so we figured
what better excuse

22:25.120 --> 22:27.960
for us girls
to have a little fun
in the Big Apple?

22:27.960 --> 22:29.080
Well, it sounds great,

22:29.080 --> 22:31.210
but, you know,
I have to ask my parents.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.830
If you text them when you're
already on your way,

22:33.830 --> 22:35.120
they can't say no.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.040
I taught her that.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.210
Okay, well, then,
I-I guess we're going
on a road trip!

22:40.210 --> 22:41.830
Yay!

22:41.830 --> 22:44.960
[cell phone rings]

22:44.960 --> 22:47.960
So, I think we should
probably get on the road.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.000
New York City,
here we come, right?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.040
Yeah, I just have
to grab my purse.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
Okay.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.830
Let's go, ladies!

23:08.210 --> 23:09.960
[woman] Rob,
your name's on TV!

23:09.960 --> 23:11.120
[boing]
