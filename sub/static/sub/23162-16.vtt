WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.630
How you doing?

00:01.702 --> 00:02.964
You guys got a problem?

00:03.037 --> 00:04.470
You do.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.173
No sign of Rick
or the people on the charter.

00:07.241 --> 00:10.210
Well, they must be somewhere.
People just don't disappear.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.507
Well, I guess
that's just my bad luck.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.911
That's John Wayne?

00:13.981 --> 00:15.915
Stay in the car
and let me handle this.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.507
You really think
you can do it alone?

00:17.585 --> 00:18.574
Trust me.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.914
Get out!

00:26.894 --> 00:30.022
Coast Guard found the bodies. They want
someone to come down and make an lD.

02:38.961 --> 02:41.691
Hey, have you got
any more caviar?

02:41.764 --> 02:42.856
Yeah.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.034
You wanna tell me where?

02:46.135 --> 02:48.865
It's in the icebox,
next to the bookcase.

03:00.016 --> 03:01.847
How you doing?

03:02.285 --> 03:03.309
Hi!

03:03.386 --> 03:05.547
Hey, you guys got a problem?

03:05.655 --> 03:07.987
No, no. No problem.

03:08.491 --> 03:09.981
But you do.

03:11.794 --> 03:14.319
Call the rest of them up here.
Come on.

03:15.765 --> 03:19.861
Quit stalling! Just get the rest
of them up here. Come on. Come on.

03:21.637 --> 03:26.131
Hey, Freddie. Freddie, come on up
here and bring the guys with you.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.800
What's the matter with you?

03:27.877 --> 03:30.004
We're right in the middle...
Now, Freddie!

03:30.079 --> 03:32.843
Come on! Come on,
get the rest of them up.

03:32.915 --> 03:36.544
Mr. Yamashiro, everyone,
come up here, please. Now. Come on.

03:36.619 --> 03:38.450
That's good. Come on.
You, over here.

03:38.521 --> 03:40.113
Get over here. Get over here!

03:40.189 --> 03:41.918
Now put your hands
over your head.

03:41.991 --> 03:44.221
Everybody,
put your hands over your head.

03:44.293 --> 03:48.457
Good. Now listen.
I want all of you over here. Come on.

03:50.199 --> 03:51.393
Duck!

03:59.508 --> 04:01.237
Be cool, gentlemen.

04:07.817 --> 04:10.809
They were due back
at 1700 hours.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.281
Of course, given Rick's
usual lack of punctuality,

04:13.356 --> 04:15.916
I didn't really begin to worry
until nightfall.

04:15.991 --> 04:17.959
I called you both the moment
I heard from the Coast Guard

04:18.027 --> 04:19.358
that the yacht
had been spotted.

04:19.428 --> 04:21.658
No sign of Rick or the
people on the charter.

04:21.731 --> 04:24.063
Apparently, there were some very
important people on the charter.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.567
Rick felt it was imperative that
he take the boat out himself

04:26.635 --> 04:28.933
so that nothing
would go wrong.

04:29.472 --> 04:33.568
Well, they must be somewhere. People
just don't disappear. We'll find them.

04:33.642 --> 04:36.042
She's right.
There has to be an explanation.

04:36.112 --> 04:39.104
What was the result of your conversation
with your friend at the Coast Guard?

04:39.181 --> 04:41.615
I could only buy us
five minutes.

04:42.118 --> 04:45.212
Well, perhaps that's
all the time we'll need.

04:46.555 --> 04:48.785
How long has it
been since the yacht disappeared?

04:48.858 --> 04:50.189
Do you have a list of passengers?

04:50.259 --> 04:52.250
Do you have a theory about
how the crew disappeared?

04:52.328 --> 04:53.886
How widespread a search
are you conducting?

05:14.984 --> 05:16.645
Did you find anything?

05:16.719 --> 05:17.981
Not yet.

05:18.954 --> 05:21.286
The rubber life raft
is missing.

05:22.057 --> 05:25.618
Aside from that, it's as if no one
had ever been aboard this yacht.

05:25.694 --> 05:28.595
More like somebody
cleaned it up real good.

05:28.864 --> 05:31.059
The passenger manifest
is missing.

05:31.133 --> 05:34.068
There may be a copy of that
in Rick's office. I can check.

05:34.136 --> 05:35.535
Any idea
who booked this charter?

05:35.604 --> 05:38.437
As a matter of fact, I do.
A young man by the name of Reed Hart.

05:38.507 --> 05:39.531
Reed Hart?

05:39.608 --> 05:42.509
He's a new member of the club.
An investment counselor, I believe.

05:42.578 --> 05:44.273
Yeah. Kahana lnvestments.

05:44.346 --> 05:45.711
Wait a minute.

05:45.781 --> 05:48.045
T.C. said something about a
friend of his getting in trouble

05:48.117 --> 05:50.711
putting a little money
in Kahana lnvestments.

05:50.786 --> 05:53.949
He's not the only one. We've had two
or three complaints at the department,

05:54.023 --> 05:55.991
but nothing substantial enough
to go on yet.

05:56.058 --> 05:58.526
But, apparently, all we have
to go on here.

05:58.594 --> 05:59.856
Not quite.

06:14.477 --> 06:17.002
I don't think that's part
of the original equipment.

06:17.079 --> 06:18.376
Looks like a nine-millimeter.

06:18.447 --> 06:21.109
It's a pretty common caliber.
I don't think it's gonna be much help.

06:21.183 --> 06:23.174
Magnum, I'm sorry,

06:23.252 --> 06:26.187
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you to disembark immediately.

06:26.255 --> 06:30.715
The King Kamehameha III is now officially
sealed off pending investigation.

06:30.793 --> 06:32.693
We're leaving right now.

06:32.761 --> 06:35.457
I found this by the wheel.
Thanks, Mike.

06:36.499 --> 06:39.127
Perhaps I can find a copy
of that passenger manifest.

06:39.201 --> 06:40.862
If I come up with any names...

06:40.936 --> 06:42.494
I can run it
through our files.

06:42.571 --> 06:45.506
In the meantime, I guess all
we have to go on is Reed Hart.

06:49.378 --> 06:51.175
One thing I've noticed
over the years.

06:51.247 --> 06:53.340
Usually people hire
private investigators

06:53.415 --> 06:55.781
because they can't unravel
the puzzle themselves.

06:55.851 --> 06:57.751
Their emotions are
too involved.

06:57.820 --> 07:01.347
They need someone who is
detached, analytical, uninvolved.

07:01.423 --> 07:03.220
And that's what I've always
tried to give them.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.954
But, somehow,
that all became very difficult

07:06.028 --> 07:09.589
when the missing person was
Rick and the client was me.

07:14.103 --> 07:17.300
I can't figure it out.
I've been waiting here for hours.

07:17.373 --> 07:20.069
You haven't heard
from Freddie, either?

07:20.442 --> 07:23.843
Well, let me know
the minute you hear anything.

07:25.981 --> 07:27.846
I've gotta go.

07:30.853 --> 07:34.584
Hi, I'm Starr Davis.
Can I help you?

07:35.591 --> 07:37.058
Oh, I hope so.

07:37.893 --> 07:41.351
I'm Thomas Magnum. A friend of
mine was meeting with Mr. Hart

07:41.463 --> 07:43.829
about some sort
of business investment and...

07:43.899 --> 07:46.197
You're looking
for investments.

07:47.169 --> 07:49.194
Not exactly, no.

07:49.271 --> 07:54.106
I was just kind of curious about
what sort of investment my friend...

07:55.878 --> 07:59.473
A lot of people are embarrassed
to ask for help the first time.

07:59.548 --> 08:01.072
It gets easier.

08:02.084 --> 08:04.143
What kind of money
are we talking about?

08:05.354 --> 08:07.754
How much money
do I have to have?

08:07.856 --> 08:10.791
Well, how much risk
are you willing to take?

08:11.393 --> 08:13.293
How much risk is there?

08:14.263 --> 08:15.525
Not much,

08:15.965 --> 08:18.695
if you have
the right attitude.

08:18.767 --> 08:22.464
For example,
if you had $1,000 to invest...

08:25.140 --> 08:26.698
500.

08:29.044 --> 08:33.241
I could put you into
this pyramid organization.

08:33.315 --> 08:35.249
Strictly legal.

08:35.317 --> 08:38.650
Well, at the moment, anyway.

08:38.721 --> 08:40.712
I can't promise you
how long it'll be

08:40.789 --> 08:43.280
before the legislatures
change that.

08:43.826 --> 08:47.990
But if you're willing
to give me the money in cash

08:48.063 --> 08:50.156
and take a bit of a risk...

08:52.668 --> 08:54.295
Excuse me.

08:55.471 --> 08:57.462
I'll call you back later.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.701
I beg your pardon.

09:00.876 --> 09:02.207
Speaking.

09:03.946 --> 09:05.641
The Coast Guard?

09:15.791 --> 09:16.849
Yes.

09:17.593 --> 09:18.924
Thank you.

09:23.866 --> 09:26.562
Look, I know this might be
an awkward time,

09:26.635 --> 09:29.570
but I think I know what
that phone call was about.

09:29.638 --> 09:33.130
My friend, the one that
I mentioned when I came in,

09:33.208 --> 09:35.108
he was on that boat, too.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.509
You knew about this?

09:39.581 --> 09:42.846
Well, I didn't know anything for sure.
I mean, that's why I'm here. I thought that...

09:42.918 --> 09:43.907
Who are you?

09:43.986 --> 09:45.317
I'm a private investigator.

09:45.387 --> 09:46.411
What do you know?

09:46.488 --> 09:48.956
Nothing. I was hoping there
was something in your files

09:49.024 --> 09:51.083
that might lead us
to what happened.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.821
Get out.
What?

09:52.895 --> 09:55.386
Get out before
I call the police!

09:55.464 --> 09:56.829
What?

10:03.472 --> 10:05.372
All right, I'm leaving.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.672
But if you change your mind,
I'm in the book.

10:49.718 --> 10:53.245
When I was 14 years old,
my grandfather took me crabbing.

10:53.322 --> 10:56.883
Now, crabbing's a lot
different from trout fishing.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.257
See, you tie the bait on the line,
you drop it in the water,

10:59.328 --> 11:03.458
and when you feel the crab crawl up
on the bait and start nibbling away,

11:03.532 --> 11:06.296
you have to slowly raise
the line to the surface

11:06.368 --> 11:08.734
and then net him
as fast as you can.

11:08.804 --> 11:13.764
The only trouble is, by the time you
can see the crab, he can see you.

11:13.842 --> 11:16.743
And nine times out of ten,
he'll scuttle right back off that bait

11:16.812 --> 11:18.803
and disappear into the ocean.

11:19.782 --> 11:22.410
I guess that's what
I always liked about it.

11:22.484 --> 11:25.385
The crab had as good a chance
at a free meal as you did.

11:25.454 --> 11:27.649
But the best thing
about crabbing was

11:27.723 --> 11:30.658
that it taught me patience,
concentration,

11:30.726 --> 11:35.129
and the second sense of when the time
was right to sit and wait it out.

12:17.573 --> 12:20.303
Yeah, it's me. I'm here.
I didn't find anything.

12:21.844 --> 12:23.038
Freeze!

12:31.353 --> 12:33.685
What are you doing?
Get these off me!

12:33.755 --> 12:37.418
I'm afraid I can't
do that, pilgrim. You're under arrest.

12:41.812 --> 12:43.507
Why didn't you
tell me you were a cop?

12:43.581 --> 12:45.242
You didn't give me
a chance.

12:45.316 --> 12:48.217
Well, "Freeze. Police." That's
what you're supposed to say.

12:48.285 --> 12:52.051
I mean, didn't they
teach you that at the academy?

12:52.123 --> 12:53.715
They taught
me a lot of things, friend,

12:53.791 --> 12:55.816
most of which I forgot.

12:56.794 --> 12:58.591
Okay, now hold still.

13:01.265 --> 13:04.894
Okay, now sit down while I start
filling out the arrest form.

13:04.969 --> 13:06.197
What for?

13:06.270 --> 13:08.135
Breaking and entering.

13:08.939 --> 13:10.998
You actually saw me go
into that office?

13:11.075 --> 13:13.600
You actually saw me
break and enter?

13:13.811 --> 13:16.041
Okay, resisting arrest.

13:16.113 --> 13:18.775
Come on, I got a buddy
who might be in big trouble.

13:18.849 --> 13:20.316
I was just trying
to get some information,

13:20.384 --> 13:23.251
which, obviously,
you were trying to do also.

13:26.323 --> 13:29.554
But you must not have had
a search warrant.

13:29.627 --> 13:32.061
We're not talking about me,
pal. We're talking about you.

13:32.129 --> 13:33.221
Oh, I don't think so.

13:33.297 --> 13:36.323
I think you were breaking
and entering just like me.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.891
Now, I'm not so sure illegal
search and seizure

13:38.969 --> 13:41.130
is the kind of thing
you'd like to have get out.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.797
Are you threatening me?

13:42.873 --> 13:46.434
No, no, no. I'm just saying
that, under the circumstances,

13:47.545 --> 13:51.777
I'm not so sure of that.
It would make a lot more sense

13:52.483 --> 13:56.283
if you let me go, and I didn't
talk to anybody on the way out.

13:57.855 --> 14:00.915
Or maybe we should talk it
over with your chief.

14:05.696 --> 14:08.722
I'll tell
you what I'm gonna do, mister.

14:08.799 --> 14:12.633
I'm gonna put my feet up here
and catch 40 winks.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.563
And if you're gone
when I wake up,

14:15.639 --> 14:18.631
well, I guess
that's just my bad luck.

14:22.947 --> 14:24.881
So long, pilgrim.

14:37.695 --> 14:41.529
T.C.: So he's got a John Wayne complex.
A lot of cops do.

14:41.599 --> 14:45.160
No, no. Not like this guy, T.C. I mean,
he actually talks like him.

14:45.236 --> 14:47.898
Not all the time,
but I practically expected him

14:47.972 --> 14:50.031
to saddle up and ride off
into the sunset.

14:50.107 --> 14:51.438
May we start?

14:51.508 --> 14:52.736
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're ready.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.142
That's okay? Okay.
I'm sorry.

14:55.212 --> 14:57.339
This is Victor Manzano.

14:57.414 --> 14:59.644
Major underworld figure
in Chicago.

14:59.717 --> 15:01.742
In fact, rumor has it
that Manzano is jockeying

15:01.819 --> 15:03.912
to take over the entire
Mainland operation.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.752
There must be something wrong
with the focus on this projector.

15:06.824 --> 15:09.258
I can't seem to get
a clear picture.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.317
No,
it's not the machine.

15:11.395 --> 15:14.887
It's not the best picture in the world.
It's just the best I could find.

15:14.965 --> 15:17.525
Why don't you go
to the next one, Jonathan?

15:20.271 --> 15:22.671
This man is
Totsuo Yamashiro.

15:22.740 --> 15:23.934
Lily.

15:24.008 --> 15:25.498
He's probably
the most powerful man

15:25.576 --> 15:27.840
in the infrastructure
of the Japanese yakuza.

15:27.911 --> 15:29.674
How can you tell?

15:30.748 --> 15:34.149
Because we have reports from undercover
agents attesting to his immense power.

15:34.218 --> 15:37.312
No, I meant, how can you tell
that's Yamashiro?

15:37.921 --> 15:41.220
Because his name is
on the back of the photograph.

15:44.928 --> 15:46.327
Next, please.

15:47.031 --> 15:48.259
Jonathan?

15:48.332 --> 15:50.061
Oh, yes, of course.

15:52.169 --> 15:55.229
Billy Kapalama.
Local underworld.

15:55.306 --> 15:56.898
Which one is he?

15:58.242 --> 16:00.437
He's the one way in the back.

16:01.312 --> 16:02.779
With the hat on.

16:05.249 --> 16:06.648
You can't...

16:09.386 --> 16:11.377
That's right, you guys.
Just go ahead and laugh.

16:11.455 --> 16:13.218
You have a good time.
Laugh it up.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.758
No, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

16:15.826 --> 16:18.989
But you can't see any of them.

16:20.431 --> 16:23.559
Well, goodness knows you two
have done so much better.

16:23.634 --> 16:26.694
T.C., you spent hours flying
over practically every island

16:26.770 --> 16:28.897
between here and Bora Bora
and found nothing.

16:28.972 --> 16:31.497
Well, I found a whole lot
of jungle terrain

16:31.575 --> 16:33.941
where anybody who wanted to
could hide real well.

16:34.011 --> 16:35.911
And you,
you get yourself arrested.

16:35.979 --> 16:37.139
I did not.

16:37.214 --> 16:38.681
Well, nearly arrested.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.910
Anyway, what difference
does it make?

16:40.984 --> 16:43.612
I mean, the point is,
you found out who these guys are

16:43.687 --> 16:46.417
and what the link is between them.
That's what's important.

16:46.490 --> 16:47.821
Thank you.

16:48.992 --> 16:53.361
You figure they could be having
some sort of high-level meeting?

16:54.398 --> 16:57.299
A floating little Appalachia,
as it were?

16:57.368 --> 16:58.460
That's what it looks like.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.628
Well, if they were, it was the
best kept secret of the decade.

17:00.704 --> 17:03.070
Nobody knew,
not even Francis Hofstetler.

17:03.140 --> 17:04.732
Francis Hofstetler?

17:04.808 --> 17:05.934
Icepick.

17:06.009 --> 17:07.738
You called lcepick?

17:09.046 --> 17:11.640
His name is
Francis Hofstetler?

17:11.714 --> 17:15.515
He knew that Vic Manzano was here on
vacation and a little personal business,

17:15.586 --> 17:18.419
but certainly nothing
to do with his partners.

17:18.489 --> 17:19.887
Please don't take offense
at this, Carol,

17:19.957 --> 17:22.550
but do you honestly believe that
lcepick would simply hand over

17:22.626 --> 17:25.492
Iegitimate information to the
prosecuting attorney's office?

17:25.561 --> 17:26.893
Yes, I do.

17:26.964 --> 17:30.422
I told him that we were doing
everything we could to find Rick.

17:30.501 --> 17:34.494
He told me that Manzano was staying at
the Puna Kohola hotel on the West Shore.

17:34.571 --> 17:35.799
I'm on my way.

17:35.873 --> 17:36.999
I can get you there faster.

17:37.074 --> 17:38.632
Thanks, T.C.
Hey, listen.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.303
Try not to get caught
this time, okay?

17:55.492 --> 17:56.618
Lily.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.253
They're here.

18:34.097 --> 18:35.325
Maybe.

18:36.567 --> 18:39.661
What have you got for me here?

18:40.070 --> 18:41.560
Underwear.

18:43.841 --> 18:46.674
I know I can smell you.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.641
Anybody home?

18:57.287 --> 18:58.879
Neighbors.

19:01.492 --> 19:02.823
Bingo!

19:06.230 --> 19:09.757
Oh, come on, Gordon,
a little bit more finesse. You're a pro.

19:23.013 --> 19:24.776
Make my day.

19:26.950 --> 19:29.544
I knew it! Knew it.

19:30.854 --> 19:32.321
Genius.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.121
Yes.

19:34.191 --> 19:35.624
Whoa, partner.

19:36.693 --> 19:40.322
Got a few more miles to go
before the horse is in the barn.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.231
Okay, cookie.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.492
Let's get these
here, first thing,

19:44.568 --> 19:48.197
these serial numbers to give
to the guys in the white hats.

19:53.243 --> 19:55.006
Who are you men?
You belong in this room?

19:55.078 --> 19:56.705
Who are you?
Hotel security.

19:56.780 --> 20:00.181
I should report you for not putting
your valuables in the hotel safe.

20:00.250 --> 20:03.686
Oh, guys, I can explain this one.
Look at this.

20:03.754 --> 20:05.619
I can explain that.
Explain it...

20:05.689 --> 20:07.850
Hey, you shouldn't
do this to someone. It's mean.

20:07.925 --> 20:11.088
I'm gonna talk to your supervisor
about this kind of behavior.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.601
I guess when
things are really bad,

20:18.669 --> 20:22.935
you discover how little you really have
to say to the people you're close to.

20:23.006 --> 20:26.134
T. C. and I didn't have to remind each
other that every second was crucial

20:26.209 --> 20:28.006
if we were gonna
find Rick alive.

20:28.078 --> 20:30.740
We had a sense of that between
us without ever saying it.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.305
We also knew we had
to work on instinct alone

20:33.383 --> 20:36.352
and hope that each new direction
we took was the right one

20:36.420 --> 20:39.912
and that nothing would come up
that would get in our way.

20:46.430 --> 20:48.625
T. C: If you run into
any sign of the police...

20:48.699 --> 20:50.132
I will walk away.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.603
Believe me, I don't want even the
slightest chance of running into...

20:54.671 --> 20:56.229
Oh, no.

21:00.277 --> 21:02.302
No! It's him!

21:02.379 --> 21:04.074
That's John Wayne?

21:44.855 --> 21:46.220
Whoa! Whoa!

22:29.433 --> 22:31.060
Help!

22:33.036 --> 22:35.630
Damn,
I thought you'd never get here.

23:11.707 --> 23:15.871
Well, I guess I should say thank you,
but I'm not really very good at that.

23:15.945 --> 23:17.572
Hey, that's okay.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.115
Why wouldn't they let you
interrogate the suspects?

23:21.183 --> 23:24.346
Oh, well, it's not my case.
Procedures, rules, you know.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.751
No, you're onto something.

23:25.821 --> 23:29.052
What? No. No, no. I just stumbled
into this case, that's all.

23:29.124 --> 23:32.924
Oh, come on, you don't get all the medals
and citations I saw hanging in your office

23:32.995 --> 23:36.328
by fumbling around in somebody
else's territory with no reason.

23:36.398 --> 23:38.423
Now what do you got?

23:42.204 --> 23:45.537
Look, if you'd level with us,
maybe T.C. and I can help you out.

23:45.608 --> 23:47.075
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:47.142 --> 23:49.975
We got problems
of our own unless they're...

23:50.045 --> 23:52.206
Related? Possibly.

23:52.281 --> 23:53.407
But highly unlikely.

23:53.482 --> 23:55.450
What have you got to lose?

23:55.918 --> 23:57.385
Well...

23:57.953 --> 24:02.219
Why don't we buy you a cup of
coffee and you tell us all about it?

24:15.905 --> 24:17.998
Anyway, I got it
from a very reliable source

24:18.073 --> 24:21.440
that Manzano is bringing in
$2 million in small bills.

24:21.510 --> 24:22.875
$2 million?

24:22.945 --> 24:25.778
Funny money. And I figure,
the guy that catches him

24:25.848 --> 24:28.578
trying to sell it to the
middleman is gonna be a hero.

24:28.651 --> 24:32.212
I mean, there's probably a book in it,
a movie deal, Phil Donahue Show,

24:32.288 --> 24:34.415
house in Palm Springs,
everything.

24:34.490 --> 24:37.288
So, I meet Manzano's plane
and I tail him everywhere.

24:37.359 --> 24:40.294
To his hotel, to the
Rainbow Dream Massage Parlor,

24:40.362 --> 24:41.590
to the Kahana lnvestment
Counseling.

24:41.664 --> 24:43.529
Then to the yacht harbor.

24:43.599 --> 24:46.693
No, I lost him
after he left Reed Hart's.

24:48.103 --> 24:49.900
Well, I went out
for a hot dog, okay?

24:49.972 --> 24:52.133
I mean, I hadn't had
anything to eat all day.

24:52.207 --> 24:54.141
I didn't know they were
gonna leave so fast.

24:54.209 --> 24:55.767
Hey, hey, it's all right.

24:55.844 --> 24:58.642
No, it's not all right. I mean,
if I had been there on the pier...

24:58.714 --> 25:00.204
Gordon, they disappeared
at sea.

25:00.282 --> 25:02.876
There was no way you were gonna
see what happened to them.

25:02.952 --> 25:05.045
Maybe not. It's just...

25:05.521 --> 25:09.548
I mean, my whole
movie career just vanished.

25:12.895 --> 25:15.363
Yeah, so did our friend.

25:16.598 --> 25:21.001
They didn't take $2 million
from Manzano's room just now.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.604
Well, I'm sure he took the rest of
it on the boat to sell to Reed Hart.

25:24.673 --> 25:26.140
I've got some serial numbers.

25:26.208 --> 25:30.042
If we can get any of the rest of
the money, match the serial numbers,

25:30.112 --> 25:31.579
we got him.

25:31.647 --> 25:35.811
And anybody who knows about the money
probably knows what happened on the boat.

25:35.884 --> 25:38.978
Hey, I can talk to my friend
who invested with him.

25:39.054 --> 25:40.919
Maybe he saw something,
heard something.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.787
It's a long shot, but...

25:44.426 --> 25:46.291
I might know somebody, too.

25:46.362 --> 25:47.795
Somebody who works
very close to Hart.

25:47.863 --> 25:50.263
Can you get me an address from
that license plate number?

25:50.332 --> 25:52.800
Yeah, sure.
All I need is a phone.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.903
Phil Donahue,
house in Palm Springs?

25:59.975 --> 26:02.500
I don't know. I...

26:03.045 --> 26:04.979
And 15 cents.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.296
Thanks.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.006
In the light just now,
I saw in you the little girl

26:39.081 --> 26:41.606
who arrived here
some 40 years ago.

26:42.384 --> 26:44.375
Skinny, scared,

26:45.187 --> 26:46.552
but sturdy.

26:47.089 --> 26:49.319
Like a delicate desert flower.

26:50.592 --> 26:52.890
Transplanted
to a foreign soil.

26:53.062 --> 26:54.222
Right.

26:54.797 --> 26:58.563
Thanks to a very generous
British relocation committee

26:58.634 --> 27:00.431
with you at its head.

27:01.170 --> 27:05.732
I mean, how many children were you
responsible for bringing to a new land?

27:05.808 --> 27:07.571
Oh, perhaps a dozen,

27:08.811 --> 27:10.904
but only one desert flower.

27:14.616 --> 27:16.675
I'm sorry that we've
grown apart over the years.

27:16.752 --> 27:19.152
I never thought
that would happen.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.246
Thank you for coming over.

27:22.591 --> 27:25.287
Jonathan, why do I get
the feeling that

27:25.360 --> 27:28.727
this is more than just
a long-awaited reunion?

27:33.335 --> 27:35.565
One of my employees,

27:36.972 --> 27:40.499
a friend, really,
is in some trouble.

27:41.376 --> 27:43.241
I don't know how much.

27:43.779 --> 27:47.146
I only know that somehow,
in the last few days,

27:47.216 --> 27:51.983
his life has become intertwined
with the life of Totsuo Yamashiro.

27:57.626 --> 28:02.620
I know I once told you that I would not
hear of your relationship with that man.

28:05.234 --> 28:09.000
Now, I'm afraid
I must ask you, if you will,

28:10.038 --> 28:12.598
to tell me anything
you may know about him

28:12.674 --> 28:15.541
that might lead me
to my friend.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.214
I fear his life may be
at stake.

28:30.159 --> 28:32.150
Every case,
no matter how simple,

28:32.227 --> 28:34.491
can lead you down
a blind alley or two.

28:34.563 --> 28:35.894
You come to accept it
and just hope

28:35.964 --> 28:40.526
your little voice will warn you when
you're starting off down the wrong road.

28:42.804 --> 28:46.171
Only this time,
the clock was ticking so loud,

28:46.241 --> 28:48.937
I wasn't sure I could hear
my little voice.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.552
I think Dustin Hoffman
would play me.

29:02.624 --> 29:05.024
That's only when
we solve the case.

29:05.093 --> 29:08.392
Which is
exactly what we're gonna do.

29:08.463 --> 29:09.953
Would you...

29:10.032 --> 29:13.832
Would you please not do that
anymore, please?

29:14.503 --> 29:17.870
I'm afraid I
don't take your meaning, stranger.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.404
You go in there
full of swagger and bluster,

29:21.476 --> 29:24.206
she's not even gonna
talk to us. Now, why...

29:24.279 --> 29:28.215
Why don't you just stay in the
car and let me handle this?

29:28.984 --> 29:31.179
You really think
you can do it alone?

29:31.253 --> 29:32.686
Trust me.

29:53.675 --> 29:55.142
Hi, I was wondering
if I could...

29:55.210 --> 29:56.541
Go away!
No, wait.

29:56.612 --> 29:57.806
No, I just wanna talk to you.

29:57.879 --> 29:58.868
Go away!

29:58.947 --> 30:01.575
Please. If you'd just listen.
Will you...

30:03.852 --> 30:05.251
Get out!

30:05.821 --> 30:07.948
Get out of here!

30:23.372 --> 30:25.397
All right, sister,
you either start talking

30:25.474 --> 30:28.500
or look at facing
the next 99 years in jail.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.842
He does this all the time.
Don't take it personally.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.780
Don't think I don't
know what you're doing.

30:38.854 --> 30:40.822
Good cop, bad cop, right?

30:41.723 --> 30:42.951
No.

30:43.025 --> 30:45.118
More like bad cop, no cop.

30:45.460 --> 30:48.361
I'm the only law around here, sister,
and you better get used to it.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.624
Gordon.

30:49.998 --> 30:52.796
Here, make yourself useful and check
out these serial numbers, okay?

30:52.868 --> 30:53.926
What are you doing?

30:54.002 --> 30:56.800
You didn't think we could link you
to the rest of the money, did you?

30:56.872 --> 30:58.601
Rest of what money?

31:00.075 --> 31:02.009
Now don't be coy
with me, sister.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.066
Gordon.

31:03.145 --> 31:06.512
As soon as we match the numbers of the
bills to the numbers we confiscated

31:06.581 --> 31:08.276
from a certain West Shore
hotel room...

31:08.350 --> 31:09.681
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

31:09.751 --> 31:13.346
We've got you linked to the major
power in organized crime today.

31:13.422 --> 31:15.720
This money's gonna connect you
not only to counterfeiting,

31:15.791 --> 31:17.816
but also drugs, prostitution,
gambling,

31:17.893 --> 31:20.361
and every kind of despicable,
illegal activity there is.

31:20.429 --> 31:22.897
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:22.964 --> 31:26.525
I took that money from the office safe.
I'll admit that.

31:26.601 --> 31:30.037
But that was money from an investment
deal I closed for Reed this week.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.938
Now, maybe that money
wasn't mine legally,

31:33.141 --> 31:36.770
but I don't know anything about
any counterfeiting scheme, either.

31:36.845 --> 31:38.005
Honest.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.378
I'd like to believe you.
I really do,

31:40.449 --> 31:43.282
but serial numbers don't lie.

31:43.352 --> 31:44.546
They also don't match.

31:44.619 --> 31:45.813
What do you mean,
"They don't match"?

31:45.887 --> 31:47.514
They don't match.

31:48.957 --> 31:51.790
But if you're willing
to tell me where Reed is,

31:51.860 --> 31:55.091
I'll consider dropping the charges
down to simple embezzlement.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.461
I don't know where he is!

32:00.235 --> 32:01.463
Come on.

32:01.803 --> 32:04.795
I mean, there's nothing else
you can tell us?

32:06.441 --> 32:07.840
Look.

32:11.380 --> 32:15.646
After you left the office,
I went to Reed's house.

32:15.717 --> 32:18.845
He wasn't there.
The car was in the garage.

32:19.087 --> 32:21.715
When I didn't hear from him
the rest of the day,

32:21.790 --> 32:25.749
I went to the office, I took the money,
and I came home to pack.

32:27.496 --> 32:29.361
Now that's all I know.

32:32.901 --> 32:34.095
Honest.

32:35.504 --> 32:37.699
I wish I could tell you more.

32:40.342 --> 32:42.105
Detective Katsumoto.

32:42.844 --> 32:44.106
When?

32:45.213 --> 32:47.511
All right,
we'll be right there.

32:47.582 --> 32:51.814
Coast Guard found the bodies. They want
someone to come down and make an lD.

33:02.864 --> 33:07.233
Thanks to our very sophisticated
sonar equipment, we discovered the container.

33:07.302 --> 33:10.294
Apparently, the men were shot
execution style.

33:11.339 --> 33:14.103
And they cleaned the boat
very, very carefully.

33:14.176 --> 33:18.510
Anything that looked like a clue was
put into this container and sunk.

33:18.613 --> 33:22.743
Ironically, the one thing
they did to cover their tracks

33:23.385 --> 33:25.012
turns out to help
the investigation.

33:25.086 --> 33:28.487
The book was in the container
along with the bodies.

33:30.292 --> 33:32.157
Well, if you're ready.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.877
It's Freddie.

33:54.816 --> 33:58.149
Reed's business partner.
He just bought into the firm.

34:03.024 --> 34:04.548
Vic Manzano.

34:08.230 --> 34:10.130
Totsuo Yamashiro.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.634
Billy Kapalama.

34:18.507 --> 34:19.974
No Reed Hart.

34:23.945 --> 34:25.674
And no Rick Wright.

34:31.351 --> 34:33.820
So we're right back
where we started.

34:33.887 --> 34:35.184
Not necessarily.

34:35.255 --> 34:36.449
Will there be
anything else?

34:36.523 --> 34:38.184
No, thank you, Maile.

34:38.257 --> 34:41.920
The link we thought we had found between
the three men was organized crime.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.929
Apparently, that is true
but irrelevant.

34:43.998 --> 34:48.900
According to my sources, Yamashiro was in
Honolulu to conduct business with Manzano.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.231
Sources? What sources?

34:50.304 --> 34:52.272
That's not important.
What is important is

34:52.339 --> 34:55.433
that he was buying $2
million American counterfeit.

34:55.509 --> 34:57.374
And Kapalama was
the local go-between.

34:57.444 --> 34:58.468
Yes.

34:58.545 --> 35:01.343
Well, that puts three of them together,
but where does Reed Hart fit in?

35:01.415 --> 35:03.076
T.C.: Maybe he was going
to them for help.

35:03.550 --> 35:07.680
According to my friend, Hart was into
a lot of people way over his head.

35:07.755 --> 35:11.020
In fact, rumor has it that if he didn't
come up with a half-million fast,

35:11.091 --> 35:13.616
he might end up at the bottom
of the Molokai Channel.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.424
Which is where
he may well be right now.

35:16.797 --> 35:18.697
Along with Rick Wright.

35:22.436 --> 35:25.428
Well, it's a possibility
we have to consider.

35:26.006 --> 35:27.564
There's something
we're not seeing.

35:27.641 --> 35:30.303
There's something we're not seeing,
and it's right in front of us.

35:30.377 --> 35:33.039
Six men get on
the King Kam III.

35:33.113 --> 35:36.844
Hart and his business partner,
three businessmen and Rick.

35:36.917 --> 35:41.479
Now four of them end up murdered in a container.
What about Rick and Reed Hart?

35:41.555 --> 35:44.718
Perhaps they went overboard
during the struggle.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.957
Six men get on a boat,

35:48.429 --> 35:50.260
Or they don't.

35:50.330 --> 35:51.695
You lost them.

35:51.765 --> 35:53.858
Outside Reed Hart's office.

35:58.172 --> 36:00.265
I'm afraid that's not...

36:00.340 --> 36:02.035
This way, pilgrim.

36:03.277 --> 36:04.710
Thomas, what about...

36:04.778 --> 36:06.405
I don't know yet.

36:09.049 --> 36:11.108
Perhaps it's a character
trait held in common

36:11.185 --> 36:13.983
by everyone who becomes
an investigator.

36:14.888 --> 36:16.685
Something in the DNA.

36:21.028 --> 36:23.519
Finally, I was hearing
my little voice loud and clear.

36:23.597 --> 36:25.724
And it was reminding me
of rule number five

36:25.799 --> 36:28.768
in the private investigator's
handbook:

36:31.472 --> 36:33.736
Never overlook the obvious.

36:52.359 --> 36:54.793
There's Hart's car
right there.

37:01.368 --> 37:04.531
I thought Starr said
she saw it at his house.

37:04.605 --> 37:05.970
She did.

37:17.684 --> 37:19.675
That's Reed Hart, all right.

37:22.623 --> 37:24.853
I think we've been had.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.252
How many times
do I have to tell you?

37:27.327 --> 37:29.295
I didn't know!
But you suspected.

37:29.363 --> 37:31.092
They would kill me
if I talk to you.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.429
Well, if they don't, I might!
Now, I'm through playing games.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.593
I want to know what you know!

37:36.804 --> 37:38.032
Okay.

37:38.605 --> 37:42.905
Reed told some people they could
make a 200% return on an investment.

37:42.976 --> 37:45.877
They wanted to collect.
He didn't have the money.

37:45.946 --> 37:47.607
Maybe he could've
sold his car.

37:47.681 --> 37:49.080
I told him that.

37:49.149 --> 37:51.140
He was afraid
of starting a run

37:51.218 --> 37:53.948
if all of his investors knew
that he was in trouble.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.012
He said he'd work it out.

37:56.757 --> 37:58.452
And then Billy came in.

37:58.525 --> 37:59.685
Kapalama.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.320
He said he needed
a legitimate front.

38:02.396 --> 38:06.662
A respectable, out-of-the-way place
for two men to conduct business.

38:07.167 --> 38:11.126
He said it had to be secure because there
was, like, a couple of million at stake.

38:11.205 --> 38:13.867
So Reed told his buddies where
the meeting was gonna take place

38:13.941 --> 38:16.205
so they could just come in
and take the money.

38:16.276 --> 38:18.506
I told him it was dangerous.

38:18.846 --> 38:21.974
He said they'd make it look
like he was innocent.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.643
It was only supposed
to be a robbery.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.519
No one was supposed
to get killed.

38:28.555 --> 38:30.955
He didn't have
any other way out.

38:31.191 --> 38:33.318
Where can I find these guys?

38:41.869 --> 38:44.804
He was going to steer the boat
near this deserted island.

38:44.872 --> 38:49.138
They were gonna stay there with
the money until things cooled down.

38:51.411 --> 38:54.744
He didn't even know that
the money was counterfeit.

38:58.218 --> 39:00.482
All of this
for Monopoly money.

39:00.821 --> 39:02.345
Where are you going?
I'm going out there.

39:02.422 --> 39:03.411
In the dark?

39:03.490 --> 39:04.889
It'll be light in an hour.

39:04.958 --> 39:06.892
Look, we found
what we were looking for,

39:06.960 --> 39:09.019
so let's just turn it over
to the authorities.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.792
I thought you were gonna break
this case no matter what.

39:11.865 --> 39:13.730
I did. We did.

39:13.800 --> 39:17.236
But we just can't go charging in
there like it's San Juan Hill.

39:17.304 --> 39:19.568
Let's just turn it over
to the Coast Guard, the FBl.

39:19.640 --> 39:23.770
They've got all the equipment,
the firepower. I'll just make the call.

39:23.844 --> 39:26.005
You're gonna call
the Coast Guard?

39:26.079 --> 39:28.411
You have
my word on it, pilgrim.

39:36.089 --> 39:39.650
There comes a moment in every case
when you know you're on the right track.

39:39.726 --> 39:42.889
And that moment had finally
arrived in this one.

39:43.163 --> 39:46.223
I knew, somehow,
that Rick was on that island.

39:46.466 --> 39:49.629
I just wasn't sure
whether he was dead or alive.

39:50.337 --> 39:51.827
T. C: Old Gordy's
not gonna be too happy

39:51.905 --> 39:54.203
when he finds out
that we went in after Rick

39:54.274 --> 39:56.242
after you promised him
that we wouldn't.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.607
Well, he'll get over it.

39:57.678 --> 40:00.875
Right now I'm more concerned
about Rick than old Gordy.

40:07.955 --> 40:09.923
I'm glad we beat
the Coast Guard.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.356
If Rick is on the island,
maybe we can find him and get him out

40:12.426 --> 40:14.587
before the fireworks start.

40:15.228 --> 40:18.288
That is, if we don't give away
our position going in.

40:18.365 --> 40:23.268
A helicopter landing doesn't exactly give
you the advantage of a surprise attack.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.998
I'll come in low.

40:25.072 --> 40:26.937
The trees will absorb
the sound.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.998
It's the best I can do.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.068
PSST!

41:40.747 --> 41:42.442
Over here.

41:47.554 --> 41:49.215
The life raft.

41:49.856 --> 41:52.222
That means
he's here somewhere.

42:28.361 --> 42:30.226
Hold it or I'll shoot!

42:31.498 --> 42:32.829
Rick.

42:33.366 --> 42:36.995
T.C. Good. You're just in time
for high surf. The surf's up.

42:37.070 --> 42:39.470
I don't know
where my surfboard is,

42:39.539 --> 42:41.666
but I got a raft somewhere.
I got a raft.

42:41.741 --> 42:44.835
Obviously delirious.
I'd better see to that wound.

42:44.911 --> 42:47.141
Come on, guys.
You're gonna miss all the great action.

42:47.214 --> 42:49.273
Rick, we're not
missing anything.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.613
Now, forget about the raft.
We're taking you home.

42:51.685 --> 42:54.176
I'm afraid
I can't let that happen.

42:55.922 --> 42:57.822
Drop it. Right there.

42:57.891 --> 43:01.156
Thomas, these are the guys
that are in trouble. They...

43:01.428 --> 43:02.861
This man is seriously wounded.

43:02.929 --> 43:05.727
He must have
immediate medical attention.

43:06.199 --> 43:08.667
Look, maybe we can just talk.

43:08.735 --> 43:10.396
This is the Coast Guard.

43:10.470 --> 43:12.631
Drop your weapons and come
out with your hands up.

43:12.706 --> 43:14.537
Don't even think about it.

43:14.608 --> 43:16.166
Get their guns.

43:17.878 --> 43:19.539
This is the Coast Guard.

43:19.613 --> 43:22.912
Drop your weapons and come out
with your hands up.

43:28.288 --> 43:30.756
We have you surrounded.

43:30.824 --> 43:34.453
Come out immediately,
or we'll come in after ya.

43:34.528 --> 43:36.758
Then you'll have to come in and get us!
We're not coming out!

43:36.830 --> 43:38.161
We're not taking on
the Coast Guard.

43:38.231 --> 43:41.325
Did you hear any boats
come in? Any planes? Get...

43:54.481 --> 43:55.948
Thomas!

44:05.825 --> 44:07.383
What time is it?

44:07.661 --> 44:09.424
Yo, Magnum!

44:10.063 --> 44:11.530
I bet
you were beginning to doubt

44:11.598 --> 44:14.123
that I'll ever show up,
eh, partner?

44:14.201 --> 44:17.034
I'm not your partner.
Don't call me that.

44:17.103 --> 44:20.368
What happened to, "We can't go charging
in there like it's San Juan Hill"?

44:20.440 --> 44:23.068
What happened to "Let's
bring in the Coast Guard"?

44:23.143 --> 44:26.340
What happened to "I'll make
the phone call myself"?

44:26.413 --> 44:29.405
Well, I guess you can't trust some guys
to do what they say they will, huh?

44:29.482 --> 44:30.949
But you wanna hear
how I did it?

44:31.017 --> 44:32.075
No.

44:32.152 --> 44:34.416
"Mr. Maxi-Phone!"

44:35.422 --> 44:38.357
If you'll send
the prisoners to my Zodiac

44:38.425 --> 44:39.949
near the leeward shore...

44:41.962 --> 44:45.125
I will be glad
to send them to the authorities.

44:45.765 --> 44:47.255
Now hold it.

44:47.334 --> 44:49.962
We are going to turn these men
over to the Coast Guard.

44:50.036 --> 44:52.095
T.C. can call them
from the chopper.

44:52.172 --> 44:54.640
I'll wait with you till they get here.
And then...

44:54.708 --> 44:59.441
Then I don't ever wanna see or hear
from you again in my entire life.

44:59.512 --> 45:01.104
Do you understand?

45:01.181 --> 45:03.775
Yeah, sure,
if that's how you feel.

45:03.850 --> 45:05.511
That's how I feel.

45:10.223 --> 45:12.691
Wow, bummer.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.318
Who is that guy?

45:15.629 --> 45:17.153
John Wayne.

45:20.367 --> 45:21.994
I just wanna say one thing.

45:22.068 --> 45:24.093
I don't wanna
hear about it.

45:24.170 --> 45:25.364
Thanks.

45:27.307 --> 45:30.140
I figured out who's gonna
play you in the movie.

45:30.210 --> 45:32.644
There isn't gonna be a movie.

45:32.812 --> 45:34.211
Burt Reynolds.

45:35.115 --> 45:37.208
Dustin Hoffman
and Burt Reynolds in

45:37.284 --> 45:40.151
This Island Isn't Big Enough.
You like the title?

45:40.220 --> 45:41.312
It just came to me.

45:41.388 --> 45:44.619
I figure we can always change it,
you know, if it doesn't test well.

45:44.691 --> 45:47.319
Now, who do you think
we can get for the girl, huh?

45:47.394 --> 45:49.521
Mary Steenburgen.
