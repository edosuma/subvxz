00:01.000 --> 00:04.279
- The Pandorica is opening.
- What is it?

00:04.400 --> 00:08.159
Box, cage, prison? It was built to contain
the most feared thing in all the universe.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.799
Anything that powerful,
I'd know about it.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.199
Everything that ever hated you
is coming here tonight.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.079
They're all here, all of them.
All for you. What could you possibly be?

00:17.160 --> 00:20.639
If something can be remembered,
it can come back.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.039
Hello, Amy.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.999
- But you died. How can you be here?
- What's your name?

00:25.120 --> 00:28.039
- Rory. How can she not remember me?
- Because you never existed.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.359
Who are those Romans?
They're not real. They can't be.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.799
They're all in a book
in Amy's house.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.719
- It's a trap. It has to be.
- Plastic Romans. Duplicates!

00:37.800 --> 00:42.599
Listen to me, you have to run.
I'm a thing. I'll kill you. Just go!

00:42.720 --> 00:45.999
There's something wrong with the TARDIS.
Something else is controlling it.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.719
26th June 201 0.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.159
DALEK: A scenario was devised
from the memories of your companion.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.319
Rory Williams from Leadworth.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.639
My boyfriend.
How could I ever forget you?

00:57.720 --> 01:01.239
DALEK: The cracks in time
are the work of the Doctor.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.799
- The Pandorica is ready.
- Ready for what?

01:04.880 --> 01:07.759
DALEK: Ready for you.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.559
Every sun will supernova
at every moment in history.

01:11.640 --> 01:16.039
The whole universe will never
have existed! Listen to me!

01:35.360 --> 01:37.359
(WIND WHISTLING)

01:41.280 --> 01:43.039
(OWL HOOTS)

01:52.400 --> 01:55.159
(SWING SQUEAKS)

01:57.000 --> 02:02.479
Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls
and pencils and the fish.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.359
It's Easter now,
so I hope I didn't wake you,

02:05.440 --> 02:10.399
but, honest, it is an emergency.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.399
There's a crack in my wall.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.279
Aunt Sharon says
it's just an ordinary crack,

02:18.360 --> 02:21.239
but I know it's not, cos at night,
there's voices.

02:21.320 --> 02:26.239
So, please, please, could you
send someone to fix it?

02:26.320 --> 02:28.159
Or a policeman. Or...

02:31.440 --> 02:33.679
(RUSHING OF WIND)

02:38.120 --> 02:39.599
Back in a moment.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.759
It's a lovely painting, Amelia.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.919
And what are all these?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.799
Stars.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.399
Oh, Amelia!

03:11.960 --> 03:13.479
Tell you what,

03:13.560 --> 03:15.119
shall we go outside?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.919
What do you see, Amelia?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.599
The moon.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.319
And what else?

03:24.400 --> 03:27.959
- Just the dark.
- But no stars.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.999
If there were stars up there,
we'd be able to see them, wouldn't we?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.679
Amelia, look at me.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.999
You know this is all just a story,
don't you?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.399
You know there's no such thing as stars.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.799
(MUFFLED CONVERSATION
FROM DOWNSTAIRS)

03:58.880 --> 04:00.279
It's quite common, actually.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.639
Throughout history, people have talked
about seeing stars in the sky.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.239
God knows where it comes from.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.719
AUNT SHARON: I just don't want her growing
up and joining one of those Star Cults.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.159
I don't trust that Richard Dawkins.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.559
Come on, Aunt Sharon.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.119
- Look at that! That's good, isn't it?
- Not that! This way.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.039
- But we're not looking at anything.
- This way!

05:00.120 --> 05:41.479
Amelia!

05:44.680 --> 05:51.479
Amelia?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.679
Amelia!

05:54.760 --> 05:58.119
T ANNOY: Amelia Pond,
please go to the reception, please.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.199
Your aunt is waiting for you there.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.879
Amelia Pond, please go to...

06:10.160 --> 06:11.759
Sorry.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.199
OK, kid.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.279
This is where it gets complicated.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.319
So the universe ended.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.279
You missed that.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.839
In 1 02 AD.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.159
I suppose this means you and I
never get born at all.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.519
Twice, in my case.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.879
You would have laughed at that.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.759
Please laugh!

08:55.040 --> 08:58.199
The Doctor said the universe
was huge and ridiculous,

08:58.280 --> 09:00.399
and sometimes there were miracles.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.399
I could do with
a ridiculous miracle about now.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.399
Rory! Listen, she's not dead.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.159
Well, she is dead,
but it's not the end of the world.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.759
Well, it is the end of the world.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.719
Actually, it's the end of the universe.
Oh, no. Hang on!

09:19.960 --> 09:22.479
Doctor? Doctor!

09:23.480 --> 09:26.759
- You need to get me out of the Pandorica.
- You're not in the Pandorica.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.199
Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now,
but I was back then.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.319
Well, back now from your point of view,
which is back then from my point of view.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.999
Time travel, you can't keep it straight
in your head.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.679
It's easy to open from the outside -
just point and press.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.439
Now go.

09:44.600 --> 09:49.199
Oh, when you're done, leave my screwdriver
in her top pocket. Good luck!

09:49.280 --> 09:52.079
What do you mean?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.639
Done what?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.159
How did you do that?

10:06.240 --> 10:07.959
You gave me this.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.519
No, I didn't.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.199
You did. Look at it.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.559
Temporal energy. Same screwdriver, at
different points in its own time stream.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.679
Which means it was me who gave it
to you. Me from the future.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.119
I've got a future, that's nice.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.999
That's not.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.199
Yeah. What are they?

10:35.280 --> 10:41.599
History has collapsed. Whole races
have been deleted from existence.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.879
These are just like after-images.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.959
Echoes, fossils in time.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.719
- The footprints of the never-were.
- Er, what does that mean?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.679
Total event collapse. The universe
literally never happened.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.159
So, how can we be here?

10:56.240 --> 10:57.399
What's keeping us safe?

10:57.480 --> 11:01.199
Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all.
We're just the last light to go out.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.639
Amy. Where's Amy?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.119
I killed her.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.439
Oh, Rory!

11:13.440 --> 11:15.559
Doctor, what am I?

11:15.640 --> 11:20.559
You're a Nestene duplicate. A lump
of plastic with delusions of humanity.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.239
But I'm Rory now.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.639
Whatever was happening,
it's stopped.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.039
- I'm Rory!
- That's software talking.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.599
Can you help her?
Is there anything you can do?

11:31.680 --> 11:34.359
Yeah, probably, if I had the time.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.719
The time?!

11:35.800 --> 11:38.959
All of creation has just been
wiped from the sky.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.039
Do you know how many lives
now never happened?

11:42.120 --> 11:44.359
All the people who never lived?

11:44.440 --> 11:47.879
Your girlfriend isn't more important
than the whole universe.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.439
She is to me!

11:53.280 --> 11:56.679
Welcome back, Rory Williams!

11:58.080 --> 11:59.159
Sorry, had to be sure.

11:59.200 --> 12:03.079
Hell of a gun-arm you're packing there.
Right, we need to get her downstairs.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.359
And take that look off your plastic face.
You're getting married in the morning!

12:11.120 --> 12:15.599
- So you've got a plan, then?
- Bit of a plan, yeah.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.839
Memories are more powerful than you think,
and Amy Pond is not an ordinary girl.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.839
Grew up with a time crack in her wall,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.479
the universe pouring through
her dreams every night.

12:24.600 --> 12:28.599
The Nestenes took a memory print of her
and got more than they bargained for.

12:28.680 --> 12:32.559
Like you. Not just your face,
but your heart and your soul.

12:32.680 --> 12:37.359
I'm leaving her a message for when she
wakes up, so she knows what's happening.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.079
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- Saving her.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.559
This box is the ultimate prison.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.679
You can't even escape by dying.
It forces you to stay alive.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.919
But she's already dead.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.959
Mostly dead. The Pandorica can
stasis-lock her that way.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.079
All it needs is a scan of her living DNA
and it'll restore her.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.959
- Where's it going to get that?
- In about 2,000 years.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.279
Are you all right?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.319
Who are you?

13:09.400 --> 13:13.439
I'm...fine.
I'm supposed to...rest.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.239
- Got to rest, the Doctor says.
- What doctor?

13:16.360 --> 13:20.759
He's in here. Left a message in my head
like I'm an answerphone. Where am I?

13:20.840 --> 13:22.759
Hang on.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.359
National Museum, right? I was here
once when I was a little...

13:27.720 --> 13:29.999
Yeah, complicated.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.279
Let's see, it's what...

13:34.440 --> 13:36.079
1 996?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.479
Who are you?

13:39.560 --> 13:41.039
It's a long story.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.639
Oh!

13:44.720 --> 13:46.199
A very long story.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.999
She's going to be in that box
for 2,000 years?!

13:53.080 --> 13:56.479
Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut.
River's Vortex Manipulator.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.559
Rubbish way to time travel, but
the universe is tiny now. We'll be fine.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.119
So the future's still there, then?
Our world?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.479
A version of it.
Not quite the one you know.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.039
Earth alone in the sky.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.839
Let's go and have a look.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.559
You put your hand there.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.439
Don't worry, should be safe.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.599
That's not what I'm worried about.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.839
She'll be fine.
Nothing can get into this box.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.199
- You got in there.
- Well, there's only one of me. I counted.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.119
This box needs a guard.
I killed the last one.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.719
No. Rory, no.
Don't even think about it.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.759
She'll be all alone.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.519
- She won't feel it.
- You bet she won't!

14:33.640 --> 14:38.919
2,000 years, Rory. You won't even sleep,
you'd be conscious every second.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.719
It would drive you mad.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.719
Will she be safer if I stay?

14:43.800 --> 14:47.559
Look me in the eye
and tell me she wouldn't be safer.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.599
- Rory...
- Answer me!

14:52.600 --> 14:56.239
Yes. Obviously.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.799
Then how could I leave her?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.519
Why do you have to be so...

15:04.680 --> 15:06.439
...human?

15:06.520 --> 15:09.479
Because right now, I'm not.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.959
Listen to me.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.439
This is the last bit of advice
you're going to get in a very long time.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.639
You're living plastic, but not immortal.
I have no idea how long you'll last.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.399
And you're not indestructible.
Stay away from heat and radio signals.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.279
You can't heal or repair yourself.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.599
So, for God's sake, however bored
you get, stay out of...

15:49.320 --> 15:52.839
MAN: According to legend,
wherever the Pandorica was taken,

15:52.920 --> 15:54.719
throughout its long history,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.079
the Centurion would be there,
guarding it.

15:57.160 --> 16:01.159
He appears as an iconic image
in the artwork of many cultures,

16:01.240 --> 16:04.479
and there are several documented
accounts of his appearances

16:04.560 --> 16:07.199
and his warnings to the many
who attempted to open the box

16:07.280 --> 16:09.919
- before its time.
- (AIR-RAID SIREN)

16:10.000 --> 16:14.799
His last recorded appearance
was during the London Blitz in 1 941 .

16:14.880 --> 16:18.879
The warehouse where the Pandorica
was stored was destroyed

16:19.000 --> 16:23.639
by incendiary bombs, but the box itself
was found the next morning,

16:23.720 --> 16:26.079
a safe distance from the blaze.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.079
There are eyewitness accounts
from the night of the fire

16:29.160 --> 16:32.159
of a figure in Roman dress,
carrying the box

16:32.240 --> 16:34.039
from the flames. Since then,

16:34.120 --> 16:37.399
there have been no sightings
of the Lone Centurion,

16:37.480 --> 16:41.799
and many have speculated
that if he ever existed,

16:41.880 --> 16:44.159
he perished in the fires of that night,

16:44.240 --> 16:46.759
performing one last act of devotion

16:46.840 --> 16:51.039
to the box he had pledged to protect
for nearly 2,000 years.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.719
Rory...

16:52.800 --> 16:55.639
Oh, Rory...

16:55.720 --> 16:58.679
- Exterminate!
- What's that?

16:58.760 --> 17:01.319
Exterminate!

17:01.400 --> 17:03.119
Trouble.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.759
Oh! Two of you? Complicated.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.079
Exterminate!

17:08.160 --> 17:09.799
Weapons systems restoring.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.759
- Come along, Ponds.
- Exterminate!

17:14.480 --> 17:16.319
What are we doing?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.919
Well, we are running into a dead end,
where I'll have a brilliant plan

17:19.000 --> 17:20.599
that basically involves
not being in one.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.199
What's going on?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.559
Get out of here. Go! Just run!

17:24.640 --> 17:27.199
Drop the device!

17:27.280 --> 17:28.599
It's not a weapon. Scan it.
It's not a weapon,

17:28.680 --> 17:30.119
and you don't have the power to waste.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.599
Scans indicate intruder unarmed.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.999
Do you think(?)

17:39.920 --> 17:43.639
Vision impaired! Vision...

17:46.520 --> 17:49.039
Amy?

17:49.120 --> 17:50.799
Rory...

17:56.720 --> 17:59.759
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it,
it just happened.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.879
Oh, shut up.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.719
Yeah, shut up, cos we've got to go.
Come on!

18:04.800 --> 18:08.319
I waited. 2,000 years, I waited for you.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.719
No, still shut up.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.159
And break.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.679
And breathe!

18:13.760 --> 18:17.799
Well, somebody didn't get out much
for 2,000 years.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.439
I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.039
Oh, it's all mouths today, isn't it?!

18:27.160 --> 18:31.279
The light!
The light from the Pandorica,

18:31.360 --> 18:33.519
it must have hit the Dalek.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.959
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

18:36.040 --> 18:38.399
Out, out, out!

18:44.200 --> 18:47.199
So, 2,000 years. How did you do?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.039
- Kept out of trouble.
- Oh.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.079
How?

18:53.160 --> 18:54.119
Unsuccessfully.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.199
The mop!

18:55.240 --> 18:59.199
That's how you looked all those years ago
when you gave me the sonic.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.679
Ah! Well, no time to lose, then.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.479
Rory! Listen, she's not dead.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.359
Well, she is dead,
but it's not the end of the world.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.479
Oops, sorry.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.439
How can he do that? Is he magic?

19:14.840 --> 19:17.119
You need to get me
out of the Pandorica.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.519
But you're not in the Pandorica.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.759
Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now.
But I was back then.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.519
Right...let's go, then.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.199
Wait!

19:26.280 --> 19:30.239
Now I don't have the sonic -
I just gave it to Rory 2,000 years ago.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.159
And when you're done,
leave my screwdriver in her top pocket.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.439
Right, then.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.159
Off we go!

19:40.240 --> 19:45.719
No, hang on.
How did you know...to come here?

19:48.880 --> 19:51.999
Ah, my handwriting. OK!

20:03.360 --> 20:05.519
There you go, drink up!

20:05.600 --> 20:08.239
What is that?
How are you doing that?

20:08.320 --> 20:11.319
Vortex Manipulator - cheap and nasty
time travel. Very bad for you.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.439
I'm trying to give it up.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.519
- Where are we going?
- The roof.

20:25.800 --> 20:30.679
Doctor, it's you. How can it be you?

20:30.760 --> 20:33.359
- AMY: Doctor, isthat you?
- Yeah, it's me.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.799
Me from the future.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.999
(FUTURE DOCTOR WHISPERS)

20:50.400 --> 20:52.359
Are you...?

20:52.440 --> 20:55.439
I mean, is he...

20:55.520 --> 20:58.079
is he dead?

20:58.160 --> 20:59.599
What?

21:01.120 --> 21:04.799
Dead? Yes, yes. Of course he's dead.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.039
Right, I've got 1 2 minutes,
that's good.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.639
1 2 minutes to live? How is that good?!

21:09.760 --> 21:12.719
You can do loads in 1 2 minutes - suck
a mint, buy a sledge, have a fast bath.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.759
- Come on, the roof!
- We can't leave you here, dead.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.839
Oh, good - are you in charge now(?)

21:16.960 --> 21:19.959
So, tell me,
what are we going to do about Amelia?

21:22.720 --> 21:24.319
Where did she go?

21:26.280 --> 21:27.319
Amelia?

21:27.400 --> 21:28.959
There is no Amelia.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.039
From now on, there never was.
History is still collapsing.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.719
- How can Ibe here if she's not?
- You're an anomaly. We all are.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.399
We're all hanging on at the eye
of the storm, but the eye is closing,

21:38.480 --> 21:41.199
and if we don't do something fast,
reality will never have happened.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.879
Today, just dying is a result.
Now, come on!

21:46.440 --> 21:47.879
He won't die.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.559
Time can be rewritten.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.639
He'll find a way. I know he will.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.199
DOCTOR: Move it! Come on!

22:03.000 --> 22:06.519
- (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)
- Restore...

22:08.320 --> 22:15.999
Restore...!

22:20.240 --> 22:22.679
AMY: What, it's morning already?
How did that happen?

22:22.760 --> 22:25.519
History is shrinking.
Is anybody listening to me?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.479
Universe is collapsing.
We don't have much time left.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.519
What are you doing?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.159
- Looking for the TARDIS.
- But the TARDIS exploded.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.599
OK, then,
I'm looking for an exploding TARDIS.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.239
I don't understand. So, the TARDIS blew up
and took the universe with it.

22:38.320 --> 22:42.199
- But why would it do that? How?
- Good question for another day.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.679
The question for now is...total event
collapse means that every star

22:44.800 --> 22:48.079
in the universe never happened.
Not one single one of them ever shone.

22:48.160 --> 22:53.039
So, if all the stars that ever were
are gone, then what...is that?

22:54.720 --> 22:58.439
Like I said,
I'm looking for an exploding TARDIS.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.319
- But that's the sun.
- Is it?

23:02.400 --> 23:05.639
Here's the noise
that sun is making right now.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.639
- (METALLIC THRUMMING)
- That's my TARDIS burning up.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.999
That's what's been keeping
the Earth warm.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.159
Doctor, there's something else.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.439
There's a voice.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.999
(WHISPERING)

23:19.080 --> 23:22.839
- I can't hear anything.
- Trust the plastic.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.879
RIVER: I'm sorry, my love.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.199
Doctor, that's River.
How can she be up there?

23:29.280 --> 23:31.679
It must be like a recording
or something.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.439
No, it's not a recording.
Of course - the emergency protocols.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.959
The TARDIS has sealed off the control room
and put her into a time loop to save her.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.479
She is right at the heart
of the explosion.

23:40.560 --> 24:09.159
I'm sorry, my love.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.439
Hi, honey. I'm home.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.279
And what sort of time
do you call this?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.919
Amy!

24:24.280 --> 24:27.079
- And the plastic Centurion?
- It's OK, he's on our side.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.159
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.959
I dated a Nestene duplicate once -
swappable head, it did keep things fresh.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.519
Right, then, I have questions.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.479
But number one is this -

24:37.560 --> 24:41.279
what in the name of sanity
have you got on your head?

24:41.360 --> 24:45.279
It's a fez. I wear a fez now.
Fezzes are cool.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.239
Oh!

24:49.960 --> 24:52.639
Exterminate!

24:52.720 --> 24:55.919
Run, run! Move, move! Go! Come on!

25:05.640 --> 25:08.079
- Doctor, come on.
- Shh!

25:08.160 --> 25:10.719
It's moving away,
finding another way in.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.679
It needs to restore its power
before it can attack again.

25:13.760 --> 25:17.479
Now, that means we've got exactly...
four and a half minutes

25:17.560 --> 25:18.519
before it's at lethal capacity.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.359
- How do you know?
- Because that's when it's due to kill me.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.879
- Kill you? What do you mean, kill you?
- Oh, shut up, never mind.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.559
How can that Dalek even exist?

25:26.640 --> 25:29.399
It was erased from time
and then it came back. How?

25:29.480 --> 25:31.559
You said the light
from the Pandorica...

25:31.640 --> 25:35.559
It's not a light, it's a restoration
field, but never mind. Call it a light.

25:35.640 --> 25:39.159
That light brought Amy back,
but how could it bring back a Dalek

25:39.240 --> 25:41.239
when the Daleks have never existed?

25:41.320 --> 25:43.519
OK, tell us.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.399
When the TARDIS blew up,
it caused a total event collapse,

25:46.480 --> 25:47.519
a time explosion.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.559
And that explosion blasted every atom
in every moment of the universe,

25:50.640 --> 25:52.159
except...

25:52.240 --> 25:55.159
Except inside the Pandorica.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.719
The perfect prison.
And inside it, perfectly preserved,

25:57.800 --> 25:59.639
a few billion atoms
of the universe as it was.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.679
In theory, you could extrapolate the whole
universe from a single one of them,

26:03.800 --> 26:07.879
like cloning a body from a single cell.
And we've got the bumper family pack.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.519
No, no, too fast, I'm not getting it.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.439
The box contains a memory of the universe,
and the light transmits the memory.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.439
- And that's how we're going to do it.
- Do what?

26:16.520 --> 26:20.719
Relight the fire.
Reboot the universe.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.319
Come on!

26:22.400 --> 26:25.559
RIVER: Doctor, you're being
completely ridiculous.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.839
The Pandorica partially restored
one Dalek.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.999
If it can't even reboot
a single life form properly,

26:32.080 --> 26:33.719
how will it reboot the whole of reality?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.839
What if we give it
a moment of infinite power?

26:35.920 --> 26:37.839
What if we can transmit the light
from the Pandorica

26:37.920 --> 26:39.919
to every particle of space and time
simultaneously?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.719
Well, that would be lovely, dear,

26:41.800 --> 26:44.399
but we can't,
because it's completely impossible.

26:44.480 --> 26:49.439
Ah, no, you see, it's not.
It's almostcompletely impossible.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.119
- One spark is all we need.
- For what?

26:52.200 --> 26:54.359
Big Bang 2 ! Now, listen...

26:55.920 --> 26:59.879
- Exterminate! Exterminate!
- RORY: Get back! River, get back now!

26:59.960 --> 27:01.839
Exterminate!

27:05.560 --> 27:09.079
Doctor. Doctor, it's me, River.
Doctor, can you hear me?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.959
What is it? What do you need?

27:11.040 --> 27:13.799
- (BEEP)
- Where did he go?

27:13.880 --> 27:15.959
Damn it, he could be anywhere.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.999
He went downstairs... 1 2 minutes ago.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.319
- Show me!
- River...

27:21.400 --> 27:23.839
he died.

27:23.920 --> 27:28.359
Systems restoring!
You will be exterminated!

27:28.440 --> 27:30.799
We've got to move.
That thing's coming back to life.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.199
You go to the Doctor.
I'll be right with you.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.439
You will be exterminated!

27:42.520 --> 27:45.959
Not yet -
your systems are still restoring,

27:46.040 --> 27:49.159
which means your shield density
is compromised.

27:49.240 --> 27:54.079
One Alpha-Mezon burst through your
eyestalk would kill you stone dead.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.399
Records indicate you will show mercy.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.319
You are an associate of the Doctor's.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.479
I'm River Song.
Check your records again.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.239
Mercy!

28:07.320 --> 28:09.759
- Say it again.
- Mercy!

28:09.840 --> 28:12.159
One more time.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.359
Mercy!

28:17.600 --> 28:21.879
How could he have moved?
He was dead!

28:21.960 --> 28:25.559
Doctor? Doctor!

28:25.640 --> 28:27.479
But he was dead!

28:27.560 --> 28:28.999
Who told you that?

28:29.080 --> 28:32.479
- He did.
- Rule one...the Doctor lies.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.479
- Where's the Dalek?
- It died.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.679
Doctor!

28:43.960 --> 28:46.479
Why did he tell us he was dead?

28:46.560 --> 28:49.119
We were a diversion.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.919
Long as the Dalek was chasing us,
he could work down here.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.679
Doctor, can you hear me?

28:55.760 --> 28:57.239
What were you doing?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.959
What's happening?

29:04.040 --> 29:08.999
Reality's collapsing.
It's speeding up. Look at this room.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.359
- AMY: Where did everything go?
- RIVER: History's being erased.

29:13.440 --> 29:17.479
Time's running out.
Doctor, what were you doing? Tell us!

29:17.560 --> 29:19.519
Doctor?

29:23.760 --> 29:25.239
Big...

29:25.320 --> 29:26.719
Bang...

29:26.800 --> 29:27.799
2.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.119
The Big Bang.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.559
That's the beginning
of the universe, right?

29:32.640 --> 29:35.559
What, and Big Bang 2
is the bang that brings us back?

29:35.640 --> 29:36.719
Is that what you mean?

29:38.480 --> 29:39.479
Oh...

29:39.560 --> 29:43.199
- What?
- The TARDIS is still burning.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.439
It's exploding at every point
in history.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.679
If you threw the Pandorica
into the explosion,

29:48.760 --> 29:51.479
- right into the heart of the fire...
- Then what?

29:51.560 --> 29:53.879
Then let there be light.

29:53.960 --> 29:59.039
The light from the Pandorica
would explode everywhere at once,

29:59.120 --> 30:00.279
just like he said.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.879
And that would work?
That would bring everything back?

30:03.960 --> 30:08.479
A restoration field,
powered by an exploding TARDIS,

30:08.560 --> 30:10.599
happening at every moment in history.

30:10.680 --> 30:14.559
Oh, that's brilliant.
It might even work!

30:16.320 --> 30:19.759
He's wired the Vortex Manipulator
to the rest of the box.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.879
- Why?
- So he can take it with him.

30:22.960 --> 30:28.199
He's going to fly the Pandorica
into the heart of the explosion.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.999
- Are you OK?
- Are you?

30:44.080 --> 30:45.519
No.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.879
Well, shut up, then!

30:53.480 --> 30:55.999
Amy...he wants to talk to you.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.039
So, what happens here? Big Bang 2?

30:59.120 --> 31:00.959

- Shut up. Of course it was.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.439
You asked me why I was taking you
with me, and I said...

32:31.520 --> 32:32.839
"No reason."

- I was lying.
- It's not important.

That's why you told me the story -
the brand-new, ancient blue box.

48:05.560 --> 48:08.239
Oh, clever. Very clever.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.679
Amy, what is it?

48:11.760 --> 48:13.399
Something old.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.199
Something new.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.359
Something borrowed.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.479
Something blue.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.999
It's the Doctor!

48:31.920 --> 48:34.319
How did we forget the Doctor?

48:34.400 --> 48:38.919
I was plastic. He was the stripper
at my stag. Long story.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.919
OK, Doctor.
Did I surprise you this time?

48:46.640 --> 48:47.599
Er, yeah.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.039
Completely astonished.

48:50.120 --> 48:51.479
Never expected that.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.519
How lucky I happened
to be wearing this old thing.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.159

But I came anyway.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.519
You absolutely, definitely
may kiss the bride.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.999
Amelia! From now on,
I shall be leaving the...

49:10.080 --> 49:14.799
kissing duties
to the brand-new Mr Pond.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.079
No, I'm not Mr Pond.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.799
- That's not how it works.
- Yeah, it is.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.159
- Yeah, it is.
- Right, then, everyone,

49:22.240 --> 49:23.919
I'll move my box.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.599
You're going to need the space.

49:26.760 --> 49:29.119
I only came for the dancing.

That is embarrassing!

Well, you always dance at weddings,
don't you?

50:29.520 --> 50:30.759
You tell me.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.839

Thank you.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.559
Are you married, River?

50:49.640 --> 50:51.119
Are you asking?

Yes.

No, hang on.

Did you think
I was asking you to marry me,

50:59.960 --> 51:02.559
or-or-or asking if you were married?

51:02.640 --> 51:04.399
Yes.

No, but was that "yes", or "yes"?

51:06.720 --> 51:09.119
Yes.

a snog in the shrubbery yet.

- Shut up, it's my wedding.
- Ourwedding.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.759
Sorry, you two -
shouldn't have slipped away.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.039
Bit busy, you know?

51:54.120 --> 51:58.399
You just saved the whole of space
and time. Take the evening off!

51:58.480 --> 51:59.759
Maybe a bit of tomorrow.
