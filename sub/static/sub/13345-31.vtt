WEBVTT

00:08.876 --> 00:10.444
HELLO, MIA.

00:30.264 --> 00:33.634
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

00:33.734 --> 00:34.902
QUIET.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.638
I HADN'T HEARD FROM YOU.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.373
DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE?

00:39.473 --> 00:41.309
YES.
THANKS FOR YOUR CALL.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.677
AND HOW ARE YOU
FEELING?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.012
HOW DO I LOOK?

00:45.113 --> 00:46.980
THAT'S A LAWYER TECHNIQUE,
RIGHT--

00:47.081 --> 00:48.782
ANSWER A QUESTION
WITH A QUESTION?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.351
OKAY.

00:52.986 --> 00:56.023
WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D HIT BOTTOM

00:56.124 --> 00:58.992
AT THE END
OF THE LAST SESSION,

00:59.093 --> 01:03.264
BUT IT WENT DOWNHILL
FROM THERE.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.567
I DID FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, THOUGH.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.203
I'M STOPPING THERAPY.

01:11.805 --> 01:16.610
( theme music playing )

01:31.259 --> 01:33.361
I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.696
I KNOW
I'M A TOUGH CASE.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.731
BUT IF EVERY TIME
YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR,

01:37.831 --> 01:41.402
YOU END UP FEELING WORSE,
THEN IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.905
AND I COULD HAVE CALLED,
BUT I WANTED TO COME IN

01:45.005 --> 01:48.542
AND SAY GOODBYE
AND WRAP THINGS UP.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.181
I UNDERSTAND.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.420
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TRY
TO CONVINCE ME TO STAY?

01:59.520 --> 02:02.156
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'D LIKE ME TO DO?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.758
NO, I JUST ASSUMED
YOU'D BE ALL OVER ME--

02:04.858 --> 02:06.294
"THERAPY THIS,
THERAPY THAT."

02:06.394 --> 02:08.562
YOU WANT ME
TO HARD-SELL YOU

02:08.662 --> 02:10.431
LIKE A GUY SELLING YOU

02:10.531 --> 02:12.099
A VEGETABLE PEELER
ON THE STREET?

02:12.200 --> 02:15.203
JEEZ, PAUL,

02:15.303 --> 02:17.605
DON'T I GET TO BE
THE ANGRY ONE HERE?

02:17.705 --> 02:20.674
YOU MAD BECAUSE
I WANT TO LEAVE
OR HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

02:20.774 --> 02:24.044
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANT
TO TAKE YOUR BALL
AND GO HOME.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.215
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.350
IF THERAPY
HASN'T HELPED,

02:29.450 --> 02:30.918
THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO

02:31.018 --> 02:33.187
IS KEEP YOU HERE,
MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.423
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE LAST SESSION.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.458
YEAH.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.427
YEAH.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.532
I FELT LIKE SHIT.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.669
AND I WENT HOME

02:48.769 --> 02:50.638
AND I CALLED MY DAD,

02:50.738 --> 02:54.542
THINKING THAT I SHOULD GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF EVERYTHING.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.611
HE CAME OVER
AND I STARTED

02:57.711 --> 02:59.880
ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD,

02:59.980 --> 03:02.350
ALL THE THINGS
WE'D TALKED ABOUT.

03:02.450 --> 03:07.187
AND HE TURNED IT
ON ME--

03:07.288 --> 03:10.924
WHY WAS I
CREATING PROBLEMS,

03:11.024 --> 03:12.893
BRINGING UP
ANCIENT HISTORY?

03:12.993 --> 03:16.530
MAYBE HE FELT THREATENED.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.500
ESPECIALLY WHEN I ASKED
HIM IF IT WAS HIS IDEA
TO SELL THE PIANO.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.935
HE LOST IT--

03:22.035 --> 03:26.006
I SHOULDN'T BLAME HIM;
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL;

03:26.106 --> 03:28.909
I WOULDN'T BE ALIVE
WITHOUT HIM;

03:29.009 --> 03:32.480
THAT I WAS IMPOSSIBLE
FROM THE DAY I WAS BORN,

03:32.580 --> 03:34.915
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY
MY MOTHER WENT NUTS.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.319
SO IT WAS ALL
YOUR FAULT.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.120
YEAH, AND HE WENT ON--

03:40.220 --> 03:43.190
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT
I CAN'T FIND A MAN;

03:43.291 --> 03:47.895
WHO WOULD WANT
A WOMAN LIKE ME?

03:47.995 --> 03:51.799
AND THEN HE WALKED OUT,

03:51.899 --> 03:54.968
SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME AGAIN.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.906
SO THERAPY ISN'T
THE ONLY REASON

03:59.006 --> 04:01.008
YOU HAD A BAD WEEK.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.344
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
CONFRONTED HIM

04:03.444 --> 04:06.380
IF I HADN'T BEEN
TALKING TO YOU.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.382
SO THANKS TO
ALL OF THIS,

04:08.482 --> 04:11.184
I HAVE LOST
MY FATHER.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.954
YOU HAVEN'T LOST
YOUR FATHER.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.890
HE'S STILL
IN YOUR LIFE,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.892
BUT YOU DID LOSE
THE FATHER

04:18.992 --> 04:21.061
THAT YOU THOUGHT
YOU HAD.

04:21.161 --> 04:24.264
HE DIDN'T REFUTE YOUR MOTHER'S
VERSION OF EVENTS.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.368
HE JUST CHOSE
NOT TO ANSWER.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.137
AND THAT CONFIRMS
A LOT OF THE THINGS

04:30.237 --> 04:32.072
THAT WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT IN HERE.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.041
OKAY, PAUL,
I GET IT.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.411
I DIDN'T HAVE
THE PERFECT DAD.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.347
YOU'RE RIGHT AND I'M WRONG.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

04:39.447 --> 04:41.349
SO PUT THAT IN TODAY'S
SESSION NOTES,

04:41.449 --> 04:43.351
WHICH I HOPE
YOU KEEP NOW--

04:43.451 --> 04:46.754
"SUCCESSFULLY SHATTERED
PATIENT M'S

04:46.854 --> 04:49.490
ROMANTICIZED IMAGE
OF HER NARCISSISTIC FATHER."

04:49.590 --> 04:51.559
ACTUALLY WHAT
I WOULD WRITE IS--

04:51.659 --> 04:56.296
"MIA, BORN TO
A DEPRESSED MOTHER,

04:56.397 --> 04:58.098
IDEALIZES HER FATHER

04:58.198 --> 05:00.133
SO AS NOT TO FEEL
COMPLETELY ALONE.

05:00.233 --> 05:04.271
AND THIS WEEK, AFTER
FINALLY CONFRONTING HIM,

05:04.372 --> 05:09.410
SHE CAN SEE HER DAD
FOR WHO HE REALLY IS."

05:09.510 --> 05:14.114
IT IS SHATTERING,

05:14.214 --> 05:18.085
BUT IF YOU CAN NOW MOVE
BEYOND THAT CONNECTION
TO YOUR FATHER

05:18.185 --> 05:20.087
IT MAY OPEN
THE POSSIBILITY

05:20.187 --> 05:22.556
OF FINDING LOVE ELSEWHERE.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.696
YOU MEAN,
IF I STAY IN THERAPY.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.799
THAT'S ONE WAY.
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
THE ONLY WAY.

05:31.899 --> 05:35.536
GOOD, BECAUSE
I REALLY AM DONE.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.205
IN FACT, MAYBE I SHOULD
GET GOING.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.641
YOU CAN, OF COURSE.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.876
BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE,
MAYBE WE CAN AT LEAST

05:42.976 --> 05:46.013
WORK ON CLOSURE.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.281
I KNOW YOU WERE UNHAPPY
ABOUT THE LAST TIME

05:48.382 --> 05:50.584
THAT WE ENDED THERAPY.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.686
I'D LIKE TO DO
A BETTER JOB THIS TIME.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.923
HOW LONG
DOES THAT TAKE?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.158
WELL, THAT'S UP TO YOU.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.561
IF THIS IS
YOUR LAST SESSION,

06:00.661 --> 06:03.030
WE'LL USE THE TIME
THAT'S LEFT.

06:03.130 --> 06:07.067
AND I'LL BE HONEST,
YOU BE HONEST.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.402
HOW'S THAT?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.638
OKAY, LAST SESSION.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.977
WHAT DO WE DO?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.512
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
YOUR FATHER LEFT.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.648
THAT'S HOW
WE DO CLOSURE?

06:20.748 --> 06:23.150
COULDN'T WE JUST BURN
SOME SAGE OR SOMETHING?

06:23.250 --> 06:26.153
( chuckles )

06:26.253 --> 06:29.557
I ENJOY YOUR HUMOR
A LOT, MIA.

06:29.657 --> 06:34.361
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL
IT'S A WAY OF HIDING.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.896
OKAY.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.666
OKAY.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.807
AFTER DAD LEFT,

06:46.907 --> 06:50.644
I PRETTY MUCH
STAYED HOME ALL WEEK

06:52.379 --> 06:53.881
IN BED.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.052
AND I KNOW
THAT SOUNDS BAD,

06:59.152 --> 07:02.823
BUT I'M HERE NOW,
SO I GOT THROUGH IT.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.125
DID YOU GET
OUT OF BED AT ALL?

07:05.225 --> 07:09.262
UM, BATHROOM TRIPS,

07:09.362 --> 07:11.264
KITCHEN TRIPS.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.066
I ANSWERED THE DOOR
FOR DELIVERIES.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.235
DID YOU TALK TO ANYBODY?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.705
MY TRUSTY ASSISTANT HENRY,

07:17.805 --> 07:20.140
WHO THREATENED TO COME OVER
AND COOK FOR ME.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.709
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO CALL ME?

07:21.809 --> 07:23.644
WHAT WOULD I HAVE SAID--
"I'M UNDER THE COVERS

07:23.744 --> 07:25.579
'CAUSE I'M AFRAID
OF THE LIVING ROOM"?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.781
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FELT,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.517
THEN YES.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.923
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE HOPELESS?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.526
I'M NOT SUICIDAL, PAUL,
DON'T WORRY.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.494
I AM PRETTY TOUGH.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.062
DOES BEING TOUGH MEAN

07:42.162 --> 07:44.765
YOU HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH
THINGS LIKE THIS ALONE?

07:44.865 --> 07:48.536
I JUST FELT LIKE
THE BED WAS SAFE

07:48.636 --> 07:53.607
AND THE LIVING ROOM
WAS SCARY.

07:53.707 --> 07:58.612
SO YOU TOOK TO BED
LIKE YOUR MOTHER DID.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.515
SHE HAD POST-PARTUM.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.952
WHAT'S MY EXCUSE--
POST-NON-PARTUM?

08:05.052 --> 08:08.155
I WOULDN'T BELITTLE WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, MIA.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.290
YOU WANTED A CHILD.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.692
YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE HAVING ONE.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.161
THAT'S A PAINFUL LOSS.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.297
OKAY.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.299
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

08:19.399 --> 08:23.370
WHEN YOU WERE VULNERABLE AND
NEEDED YOUR FATHER THE MOST,

08:23.470 --> 08:27.608
HE WASN'T THERE FOR YOU,

08:27.708 --> 08:30.578
MAYBE THE SAME WAY HE WASN'T
THERE FOR YOUR MOTHER

08:30.678 --> 08:32.780
WHEN SHE COULDN'T
GET OUT OF BED.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.857
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I'M DONE WITH THERAPY.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.827
EVERY TIME WE TALK,
I FEEL LIKE I NEED

08:46.927 --> 08:48.996
TO SEE A THERAPIST
JUST TO GET THROUGH THE DAY.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.565
OKAY OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.834
NO MORE DAD.
NO MORE MOM.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.836
IS THIS HOW CLOSURE WORKS?
YOU REMIND ME

08:55.936 --> 08:58.238
OF MY MISERABLE FAMILY LIFE,
AND THEN MY LOVE LIFE,

08:58.338 --> 09:00.273
AND THEN WHAT?
GLOBAL WARMING?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.542
OKAY OKAY.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.080
SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT?

09:07.180 --> 09:10.483
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING A PARROT

09:10.584 --> 09:12.452
AS A PET,

09:12.552 --> 09:16.256
INSTEAD OF A BOYFRIEND
OR A THERAPIST.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.759
I COULD NAME IT PAUL

09:18.859 --> 09:20.961
AND I COULD TEACH IT
TO SAY THINGS LIKE,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.430
"WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT?"

09:23.530 --> 09:26.233
OR "IS IT ME
OR IS IT YOUR FATHER?"

09:26.333 --> 09:29.770
BUT THEN I FOUND OUT
THAT PARROTS LIVE
FOR ABOUT 80 YEARS.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.939
AND I DON'T THINK I COULD
STAND ANYBODY FOR THAT LONG.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.908
SO YOU WANT TO GO,
BUT YOU ALSO WANT
TO KEEP ME AROUND,

09:35.008 --> 09:37.577
OR AT LEAST YOU WANT
TO KEEP MY VOICE.

09:37.678 --> 09:42.082
LOOK, PAUL,
I LIKE YOU

09:42.182 --> 09:44.484
AS A PERSON.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.988
I MEAN,
THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.992
IF WE WERE FRIENDS,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.298
BUT WE'RE NOT.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.933
AND I DON'T IMAGINE

10:00.033 --> 10:01.669
YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME
MY FRIEND.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.404
THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.775
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
MY NAME WERE LAURA.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.609
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY
ABOUT THAT.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.878
MAYBE I'M JUST
AN ANGRY PERSON

10:10.978 --> 10:13.146
AND I SHOULD JUST ACCEPT
MYSELF FOR WHO I AM.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.315
NO, YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY
ANGRY AT ME.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.850
NO, I SAID I LIKE YOU.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.886
AND YOU WANT ME AS A FRIEND
BUT NOT AS A THERAPIST.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.354
YOU WANT WHAT I CAN'T
GIVE YOU.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.756
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.992
MAYBE THE QUESTION ISN'T
WHY YOU'RE LEAVING, MIA,

10:25.092 --> 10:27.027
BUT WHY YOU CAME BACK
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.764
YOU CLEARLY KNEW
THAT I WAS BEING SUED
FOR MALPRACTICE.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.967
AND YOU BELIEVED
THAT I HAD FAILED YOU
20 YEARS AGO.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.536
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT KIND OF CHOICE
WAS THAT?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.305
IT WASN'T
A REALLY GOOD ONE.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.641
OR MAYBE IT WAS PERFECT,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.044
IF YOU WERE TRYING
TO CHOOSE A THERAPIST

10:44.144 --> 10:48.181
IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU
CHOOSE THE MEN IN YOUR LIFE--

10:48.281 --> 10:50.951
LOOK FOR SOMEONE WHO'S
LIKELY TO LET YOU DOWN,

10:51.051 --> 10:53.120
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO DRIVE HIM AWAY,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.789
AND WHEN HE FAILS YOU,
WHICH HE MUST INEVITABLY,

10:55.889 --> 10:59.159
THEN YOU GET TO RAGE
AGAINST HIM.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.898
NICELY DONE.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.900
YOU'VE EVEN
DOUBLED BACK TO DAD,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.802
WITHOUT HAVING TO
MENTION HIM.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.039
LOOK, MIA, OF COURSE
YOU'RE FREE TO LEAVE THERAPY,

11:12.139 --> 11:15.075
BUT MY GUESS IS,
UNTIL YOU UNTANGLE

11:15.175 --> 11:17.745
THOSE CROSSED WIRES,

11:17.845 --> 11:20.247
THE NEXT MAN,
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT,

11:20.347 --> 11:22.015
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT--

11:22.115 --> 11:24.451
THEY'RE GOING TO
DISAPPOINT YOU TOO.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.820
THAT'S MY LIFELONG PATTERN

11:28.255 --> 11:30.157
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

11:31.358 --> 11:33.761
TOO ATTACHED TO BAD DAD?

11:37.064 --> 11:40.167
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS
20 YEARS AGO?

11:40.267 --> 11:41.802
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.470
ARE YOU SAYING
IT'S MY FAULT?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.038
MAYBE I WOULD HAVE HAD
A DECENT LIFE

11:45.138 --> 11:47.507
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT.
IT'S A LITTLE LATE NOW.

11:47.607 --> 11:50.077
WOULD YOU HAVE EVEN HEARD ME
IF I'D SAID IT THAT BACK THEN?

11:50.177 --> 11:53.346
SO YOU WAITED?

11:53.446 --> 11:56.850
AND WHILE YOU WAITED,
I HIT PERIMENOPAUSE?
GREAT.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.019
- YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN, MIA.
- WHAT?

11:59.119 --> 12:01.822
BLAMING ME FOR NOT
GIVING YOU WHAT YOU NEED
WHEN YOU NEEDED IT.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.092
NOW I GET IT--
CLOSURE IS YOU TELLING ME

12:05.192 --> 12:07.895
THAT IT'S ALL MY FAULT
AND THAT I SET YOU UP.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.730
THAT WAY WE CAN BOTH
HAVE WHAT WE WANT--

12:10.831 --> 12:13.733
I CAN BE MAD AT YOU,
AND YOU CAN BE DONE WITH ME.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.136
OKAY, HERE'S WHERE YOU
TELL ME HOW RELIEVED I'LL BE

12:16.236 --> 12:18.205
WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR.
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SAY

12:18.305 --> 12:20.874
THAT YOU'RE LIKE A KNIFE
IN MY NECK,

12:20.974 --> 12:22.910
THAT IT'LL FEEL GOOD
WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.878
THAT HOW IT GOES, ISN'T IT?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.147
SEE, THIS IS YOUR
SPECIALTY, MIA.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.349
AND IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
REPEATING THAT PATTERN,

12:29.449 --> 12:30.851
THAT'S FINE.
GO AHEAD.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.886
BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE,

12:32.986 --> 12:36.890
I SUGGEST
THAT YOU STAY IN THERAPY.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.760
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED
TO BE WITH ME.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.497
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
YOUR PATTERNS?

12:44.597 --> 12:48.368
MY PATTERNS?
LIKE WHAT?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.703
HOW YOU LIKE TO HAVE
A WOMAN ON THE COUCH

12:50.804 --> 12:52.940
WHO THINKS
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU,

12:53.040 --> 12:54.808
HOW YOU GET OFF
ON THAT.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.676
GET OFF ON IT?

12:56.776 --> 13:00.713
I'VE SEEN
HOW YOU LOOK AT ME.

13:00.814 --> 13:04.017
YOU HOLD UP THAT
NEUTRAL FACE PRETTY WELL,

13:04.117 --> 13:05.853
BUT I SEE
WHEN IT SLIPS

13:05.953 --> 13:09.789
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
AT MY NECK

13:09.890 --> 13:12.792
OR MY LEGS

13:12.893 --> 13:14.928
OR MY BREASTS

13:15.028 --> 13:18.231
AND YOU'RE WONDERING
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE.

13:18.331 --> 13:22.635
COME ON, PAUL,
YOU SAID YOU'D BE HONEST.

13:22.735 --> 13:26.039
HOW ABOUT
YOU DROP THE ACT?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.341
YOU KNOW YOU'D RATHER
HAVE ME AS A PATIENT

13:28.441 --> 13:31.344
THAN SOME HEDGE FUND GUY
WHOSE BONUS HAS BEEN REDUCED.

13:38.285 --> 13:42.622
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
HAD FANTASIES ABOUT US.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.825
CRAZY CHICKS ARE
HOT IN BED, RIGHT?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.694
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

13:47.794 --> 13:49.529
AM I MAKING YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE?

13:52.365 --> 13:55.969
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO
IN THE BEDROOM RIGHT NOW
AND FUCK?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.840
OR HOW ABOUT
ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.110
I BET YOU NEVER DID THAT
WITH LAURA.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.614
SO THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE LEARNED FROM THERAPY,

14:07.714 --> 14:10.951
SO LET'S JUST GO FUCK?
IS THAT IT?

14:15.388 --> 14:16.789
AT LEAST

14:16.890 --> 14:20.293
WE'D GET SOME RELIEF
FROM OUR MISERABLE LIVES.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.897
SO THAT'S YOUR VERSION
OF CLOSURE?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.634
IT WOULD MAKE US
FEEL BETTER,

14:27.734 --> 14:31.004
INSTEAD OF PRETENDING
THAT THIS TALKING NONSENSE
ACTUALLY HELPS.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.706
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE

14:33.806 --> 14:35.675
IF YOU BROKE
ALL THE RULES FOR ME?

14:35.775 --> 14:38.979
YOU MEAN IF I SAID YES?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.847
SO YOU WANT TO?

14:40.948 --> 14:43.350
WHAT IF I DO?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.851
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.820
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

14:47.921 --> 14:50.757
WOULD YOU FINALLY FEEL
SPECIAL ENOUGH?

14:50.857 --> 14:53.560
WOULD IT FIX EVERYTHING,
TO WIN LIKE THAT?

14:53.660 --> 14:56.196
OR WOULD YOU JUST BLAME ME
FOR CROSSING THE LINE?

14:56.296 --> 14:59.232
YOU'RE A LAWYER,
FOR CHRISSAKE.

14:59.332 --> 15:03.003
YOU KNOW
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.073
THEN I WOULD BE TRULY
GUILTY OF MALPRACTICE.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.575
YOU'VE PROBABLY REPRESENTED
DOCTORS LIKE THAT.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.011
HELL OF A WAY TO GET OUT
OF THERAPY, I HAVE TO SAY--

15:11.111 --> 15:13.480
TURN ME INTO
ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.515
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DOING.
- ISN'T IT?

15:15.615 --> 15:19.219
THEN I WOULD NEED YOU.
YOU WOULD BE IN CONTROL.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.090
AND THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE FOR YOU,

15:23.190 --> 15:26.159
TO HAVE ME BACK
IN YOUR OFFICE.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.233
MAYBE--

15:37.404 --> 15:40.140
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU REALLY DO IT.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.209
- WHAT?
- YOUR JOB.

15:42.309 --> 15:46.013
YOU'RE CHANGING THE TOPIC.
ARE YOU GETTING SCARED?

15:49.882 --> 15:52.485
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.
THAT'S MY JOB.

15:53.820 --> 15:54.821
WHAT'S YOURS, MIA?

15:54.921 --> 15:57.390
WHAT DO YOU DO AT WORK
EVERY DAY?

15:57.490 --> 16:01.594
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ANYONE
WHAT I DO.

16:01.694 --> 16:05.132
OH, HOW IS
YOUR CASE GOING?

16:05.232 --> 16:06.499
I WASN'T IN LAST WEEK.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.535
DON'T YOU HAVE A HEARING
COMING UP?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.504
SO THEY TELL ME.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.507
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT--
YOU WEREN'T IN LAST WEEK.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.476
IF YOU HAD GONE IN,

16:16.576 --> 16:19.646
WHAT CASES WOULD YOU
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON?

16:22.882 --> 16:24.051
NO TRIALS.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.485
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET A NEW CLIENT--

16:25.585 --> 16:27.187
A PEDIATRICIAN

16:27.287 --> 16:29.989
WHO MISDIAGNOSED
SOME NINE-YEAR-OLD KID,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.958
ALMOST KILLED HIM.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.626
NO WONDER
YOU STAYED IN BED.

16:33.726 --> 16:38.365
I DON'T JUDGE
MY CLIENTS, PAUL.
I PROTECT THEM.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.101
AND HOW MANY OF YOUR CLIENTS
ARE POWERFUL MEN

16:41.201 --> 16:43.170
WHO FAIL TO PROTECT
THE VULNERABLE AND THE INNOCENT?

16:43.270 --> 16:46.073
THEY'RE BEING SUED, PAUL,
JUST LIKE YOU.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.807
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE GUILTY.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.809
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THAT?

16:49.909 --> 16:53.180
17 YEARS.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.448
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU CALL IN SICK?

16:55.548 --> 16:58.485
SINCE I GOT THERE?

16:58.585 --> 17:01.654
FIVE DAYS, FOUR.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.523
IN 17 YEARS?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.059
AND VACATIONS?

17:06.159 --> 17:08.795
YOU DON'T LOSE THE WEEKS
IF YOU DON'T TAKE THEM.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.663
I SEE.
BUT LAST WEEK,

17:10.763 --> 17:14.201
AFTER CONFRONTING YOUR FATHER,
YOU DIDN'T GO IN.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.869
ACCORDING TO YOU,
I WAS DEPRESSED.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.072
I THINK YOU WERE.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.673
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S A COINCIDENCE

17:20.773 --> 17:22.875
THAT SUDDENLY YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO DEFEND SOMEBODY

17:22.975 --> 17:26.446
WHOSE NEGLIGENCE
HAD HARMED A CHILD.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.682
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
THEY'RE ALL GUILTY,

17:29.782 --> 17:32.119
BUT EVERY TIME YOU STAND
IN THAT COURTROOM

17:32.219 --> 17:34.387
TO DEFEND A CLIENT,

17:34.487 --> 17:37.324
I THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY
DEFENDING YOUR FATHER

17:37.424 --> 17:40.760
TO EVERYBODY,
ESPECIALLY YOURSELF.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.333
SHIT.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.274
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
THAT ONE?

17:54.374 --> 17:56.509
DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

18:02.549 --> 18:05.152
I NEVER MADE
THE CONNECTION,

18:06.753 --> 18:08.755
AND NOW I'M STUCK
WITH IT.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.195
I FELT LIKE I HAD
NOTHING BEFORE.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.197
NOW I HAVE
LESS THAN NOTHING.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.432
I KNOW IT FEELS SCARY,

18:19.532 --> 18:22.669
BUT MAYBE
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.372
IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT I HAVE NOTHING?

18:25.472 --> 18:28.675
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.710
YOU'VE HELPED ME
TO REALIZE

18:30.810 --> 18:32.645
THAT I'VE MADE

18:32.745 --> 18:35.415
POOR CHOICE
AFTER POOR CHOICE
MY WHOLE LIFE.

18:35.515 --> 18:39.519
BUT YOU ALSO
HAVE TO REALIZE, MIA,

18:39.619 --> 18:42.455
THAT YOU'RE AT A CRITICAL
JUNCTURE IN YOUR LIFE,

18:42.555 --> 18:45.492
THAT NOW YOU DO HAVE
THE SELF-KNOWLEDGE

18:45.592 --> 18:48.161
TO MAKE DIFFERENT,
BETTER CHOICES.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.463
DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THIS
POLLYANNA SHIT.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.932
AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE
ON THE VERGE OF REAL CHANGE,

18:53.032 --> 18:54.901
THAT'S WHEN YOU FIGHT
THE HARDEST.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.472
( chuckles )

18:59.572 --> 19:01.341
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME BACK
I TRIED TO ASK YOU

19:01.441 --> 19:03.176
ABOUT YOUR CONNECTION
TO YOUR FATHER,

19:03.276 --> 19:06.145
AND YOU SHUT ME DOWN.
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.382
THIS PAST WEEK
YOU CONFRONTED HIM.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.418
YEAH, LOOK HOW WELL
THAT WORKED OUT.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.386
I'M NOT SAYING
IT WAS EASY.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.088
BUT MAYBE IT'S WORTH IT

19:16.189 --> 19:19.692
TO FINALLY TAKE OFF
THE BLINDERS,

19:19.792 --> 19:22.161
EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT YOU SEE.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.863
BECAUSE WHAT IS
THE ALTERNATIVE--

19:23.963 --> 19:26.933
PUT THEM BACK ON AGAIN
AND WANDER AROUND
IN THE DARKNESS?

19:27.033 --> 19:29.135
DID YOU HAVE TO
TAKE THEM OFF?

19:29.236 --> 19:31.738
I DIDN'T DO IT.
YOU DID.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.843
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

19:38.645 --> 19:41.481
OH, NOTHING.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.652
JUST WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.123
I WANT THE SAME THINGS

19:51.224 --> 19:54.461
I WANTED WHEN I CAME HERE
TWO MONTHS AGO--

19:54.561 --> 20:00.032
A MAN, A HOME, A FAMILY.

20:00.132 --> 20:03.135
I'M NO CLOSER
TO GETTING THEM.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.338
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT GETTING MARRIED

20:05.438 --> 20:08.308
IS GOING TO MAKE IT
ALL BETTER?

20:08.408 --> 20:11.711
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF HOW MANY MARRIED PEOPLE,

20:11.811 --> 20:15.882
HOW MANY PARENTS FEEL
AS EMPTY AS YOU DO?

20:15.982 --> 20:18.785
LET ME ASK YOU--

20:18.885 --> 20:23.022
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU FELT REAL HAPPINESS?

20:23.122 --> 20:25.692
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

20:25.792 --> 20:27.494
WHEN I THOUGHT
THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.730
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT
MADE YOU FEEL GOOD?

20:30.830 --> 20:32.965
THAT IT WASN'T JUST ME,

20:33.065 --> 20:37.036
THAT MY LIFE
HAD MEANING,

20:37.136 --> 20:40.607
THAT THERE WOULD BE
THIS OTHER PERSON,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.409
ALWAYS.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.411
HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED

20:44.511 --> 20:47.314
THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT
ABOUT A CHILD, MIA,

20:47.414 --> 20:50.583
OR A HUSBAND?

20:50.683 --> 20:52.585
MAYBE THAT'S JUST
A PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD

20:52.685 --> 20:55.822
FROM YOUR FAMILY,
FROM YOUR FRIENDS,

20:55.922 --> 20:57.924
FROM THE CULTURE.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.661
NOT EVERYONE NEEDS THAT

21:01.761 --> 21:04.864
TO LIVE A FULL
AND CONTENTED LIFE.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.801
MAYBE WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT, MIA,

21:08.901 --> 21:11.270
IS TO FEEL CONNECTED--

21:11.371 --> 21:14.106
AUTHENTICALLY CONNECTED

21:14.206 --> 21:17.410
TO SOMEBODY
OR SOMETHING ELSE.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.212
AND WE BOTH KNOW
THAT I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.715
- WHY NOT?
- AN AUTHENTIC CONNECTION? M?

21:22.815 --> 21:25.284
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT.
I'M INCAPABLE.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.321
ARE YOU SURE?
WHAT ABOUT IN HERE?

21:28.421 --> 21:31.290
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:31.391 --> 21:33.225
I'M A MESS IN HERE.

21:33.326 --> 21:37.430
I ATTACK YOU.
I'VE DUMPED ON YOU.
I'VE TRIED TO SEDUCE YOU.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.432
I'VE BEEN A TRAIN WRECK.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.601
OKAY, AT TIMES
YOU HAVE ACTED OUT.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.671
BUT IF YOU HADN'T,
HOW COULD WE EXAMINE IT?

21:44.771 --> 21:47.507
IT'S BEEN YOUR WAY
OF COMMUNICATING

21:47.607 --> 21:50.109
TO BOTH OF US
WHAT YOU NEED.

21:50.209 --> 21:53.279
YOU'VE ALSO BEEN
HONEST, CARING.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.583
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF
VULNERABLE.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.519
YOU'VE SHOWN ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

21:59.619 --> 22:03.255
AND YOU HAVEN'T
WALKED AWAY.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.358
YET.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.828
WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU
REALLY WANT TO CHANGE.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.898
THAT'S THE REAL REASON
YOU KEEP COMING BACK.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.101
YES, OF COURSE YOU WANT
INTIMACY IN YOUR LIFE.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.603
AND I KNOW--

22:16.703 --> 22:20.272
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
CAPABLE OF THAT.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.241
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD IT.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.777
WHEN?
NAME ONE TIME.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.713
NOW.
RIGHT NOW.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.458
OH.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.715
OUR TIME IS UP, RIGHT?

23:08.821 --> 23:10.557
THANK YOU, PAUL.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.096
IT WAS A GOOD SESSION.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.644
GOODBYE, MIA.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.013
( sighs )

23:34.781 --> 23:36.015
SO...

23:38.885 --> 23:41.287
I GUESS I'LL SEE
YOU NEXT WEEK.

23:41.387 --> 23:42.755
OKAY?

23:43.623 --> 23:47.159
OKAY, I'LL BE HERE.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.540
( music playing )
