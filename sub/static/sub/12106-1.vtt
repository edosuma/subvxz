02:20.046 --> 02:23.282
Welcome to Glen Echo,
a picture-postcard community

02:23.315 --> 02:25.617
that is itself representative

02:25.651 --> 02:29.221
of a thousand small towns
found all across America.

02:29.255 --> 02:32.291
But is there a brand of unspeakable evil

02:32.324 --> 02:35.761
set to shatter the serenity
of this rural haven...

02:35.794 --> 02:39.465
the same brand of evil that has
plagued a host of similar communities

02:39.498 --> 02:41.633
for the better part of 30 years?

02:41.667 --> 02:44.570
The stories
are well-known.

02:44.603 --> 02:48.074
At crystal lake, a madman named
Jason Voorhees has killed dozens

02:48.107 --> 02:50.709
over the past three decades,

02:50.742 --> 02:53.045
leaving a devastated, deserted community

02:53.079 --> 02:56.782
fearful of his next appearance.

02:56.815 --> 03:00.586
Here on elm street, in the
suburban community of Springwood,

03:00.619 --> 03:02.788
a murderer's repeated attacks

03:02.821 --> 03:05.224
have left a psychological scar so deep,

03:05.257 --> 03:08.094
some insist that simply
dreaming about him

03:08.127 --> 03:09.695
can kill you in your sleep.

03:09.728 --> 03:11.563
Excuse me, sir. Hi.

03:11.597 --> 03:13.599
I was wondering if I could
ask you some questions

03:13.632 --> 03:15.801
about your former neighbor Frederick...

03:15.834 --> 03:18.270
and in Haddonfield,

03:18.304 --> 03:20.272
a prodigal son named Michael Myers

03:20.306 --> 03:22.274
has struck in a similar fashion

03:22.308 --> 03:24.110
on or near Halloween

03:24.143 --> 03:26.145
on at least four different occasions.

03:26.178 --> 03:28.247
For these residents,

03:28.280 --> 03:31.817
Halloween will never be the same.

03:31.850 --> 03:35.287
Who are these men? How
do they do what they do?

03:35.321 --> 03:38.190
What is the connection
between those towns

03:38.224 --> 03:39.658
and Glen echo?

03:39.691 --> 03:42.361
It will be here, our contact claims,

03:42.394 --> 03:46.132
where the next incarnation of
unrelenting evil will emerge.

03:46.165 --> 03:48.334
It was 20 years ago

03:48.367 --> 03:50.536
at this
now-abandoned farm

03:50.569 --> 03:53.805
where a boy supposedly possessed by evil

03:53.839 --> 03:57.209
was taken from his home
by a frenzied mob

03:57.243 --> 03:59.478
and thrown over this waterfall,

03:59.511 --> 04:01.213
where he perished.

04:01.247 --> 04:03.182
That boy is about

04:03.215 --> 04:05.184
to seek revenge over the town

04:05.217 --> 04:08.154
that murdered him.

04:08.187 --> 04:09.855
He knows this, he says,

04:09.888 --> 04:12.758
because he himself is the heir apparent

04:12.791 --> 04:15.527
to that throne of terror so long held

04:15.561 --> 04:17.829
by the likes of Voorhees,

04:17.863 --> 04:19.831
Myers and Krueger.

04:19.865 --> 04:21.733
This man's name

04:21.767 --> 04:23.802
is Leslie Vernon.

04:31.610 --> 04:34.146
All right, we got it.
Good job, Taylor.

04:34.180 --> 04:36.315
Did that sound forced,

04:36.348 --> 04:39.218
too much like Diane Sawyer?

04:39.251 --> 04:42.888
- I'm trying to find my own voice in this.
- No, it's tight.

04:56.235 --> 04:58.204
Ugh, you're kidding me.

04:58.237 --> 05:01.640
Taylor, this guy's not even home.

05:01.673 --> 05:04.876
No, wait. There, by the shed.

05:06.612 --> 05:09.248
Mr. Vernon, hi.

05:09.281 --> 05:12.584
Dougie, did you see that?

05:12.618 --> 05:14.686
What's going on here, Taylor?

05:14.720 --> 05:18.657
Wait. Second floor, in the window.
Did you see that?

05:18.690 --> 05:22.328
- No, I didn't see it. Would I have asked?
- Hey, hello.

05:23.529 --> 05:25.231
Mr. Vernon,

05:25.264 --> 05:28.367
it's me... Taylor Gentry.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.603
We spoke on the phone...

05:33.805 --> 05:35.507
Mr. Vernon.

05:35.541 --> 05:38.777
Hey!

05:38.810 --> 05:40.579
I'm just messing with you.

05:40.612 --> 05:42.914
I'm sorry.

05:46.518 --> 05:48.354
I'm Leslie Vernon. Hi.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.622
Mr. Vernon, could we
throw a Mike on you?

05:50.656 --> 05:53.759
Yeah, sure...
This is the living room.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.295
There's church and zo.

05:57.963 --> 05:59.998
They are my little sweeties.
Actually, he's not.

06:00.031 --> 06:02.568
- Don't put your finger anywhere near him.
- Okay.

06:02.601 --> 06:04.403
But you can pet him.

06:04.436 --> 06:06.405
He's a sweetie.

06:06.438 --> 06:08.874
I'm so terrible with these guys.

06:08.907 --> 06:12.411
I go away for days, forget to feed 'em.

06:12.444 --> 06:15.281
Little bastards just won't die.

06:15.314 --> 06:17.749
Turtles are good that way,

06:17.783 --> 06:21.019
- very feng shui.
- Yeah yeah,

06:21.052 --> 06:23.355
plants and turtles.

06:23.389 --> 06:25.391
Plants and turtles.

06:26.658 --> 06:28.694
I only keep pets I can eat.

06:31.863 --> 06:35.000
This is my pride and joy.

06:36.468 --> 06:39.471
The number of books is amazing.

06:39.505 --> 06:42.341
Yeah. I haven't been able
to keep up lately, though.

06:42.374 --> 06:44.343
I've kind of fallen behind.

06:44.376 --> 06:45.877
I notice a lot of these

06:45.911 --> 06:48.647
are manuals, textbooks.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.882
Yeah, kind of boring.

06:50.916 --> 06:54.320
- Would you say that most of these are...
- Work related?

06:54.353 --> 06:56.288
Well, I wouldn't suggest

06:56.322 --> 06:58.457
reading "gray's anatomy" for kicks.

06:58.490 --> 07:01.059
This is the fun stuff...

07:01.092 --> 07:02.628
Copperfield, Houdini...

07:02.661 --> 07:05.631
sleight of hand,
"escape tactics."

07:05.664 --> 07:07.633
- You wanna see a magic trick?
- Sure.

07:07.666 --> 07:10.336
- You got a deck of cards on you?
- Um... no.

07:10.369 --> 07:13.572
No. Yo, Doug, you got
a deck of cards on you?

07:13.605 --> 07:16.074
Dude, why would I
have a deck of cards?

07:16.107 --> 07:18.644
- Check your left front pocket.
- What the...?

07:18.677 --> 07:21.513
- Holy fucking sweet!
- Todd!

07:21.547 --> 07:23.482
What? That was
fucking sweet.

07:23.515 --> 07:25.917
- How'd you do that?
- Tricks of the trade, man.

07:25.951 --> 07:28.354
Tricks of the trade. Plenty
more where that came from.

07:28.387 --> 07:31.022
- Doug, you're in the frame.
- Sorry, dude.

07:31.056 --> 07:33.859
In reality, aren't you talking about

07:33.892 --> 07:36.395
terrorizing innocent people?

07:36.428 --> 07:39.831
No.

07:39.865 --> 07:41.967
Why...
why is that funny?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.403
Look look, you came to me

07:44.436 --> 07:46.405
to find out how guys

07:46.438 --> 07:48.907
like Mike and Chucky

07:48.940 --> 07:51.377
and Freddy do what they do, not why.

07:53.044 --> 07:54.846
I can't just sit here

07:54.880 --> 07:57.483
on the first night I ever met
you and explain it to you.

07:57.516 --> 08:00.452
It's gotta come from your own
understanding of the process...

08:00.486 --> 08:01.887
Or not.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.456
It's up to you.

08:05.691 --> 08:09.595
All right, tell us then.

08:09.628 --> 08:12.030
How do you do it?

08:12.063 --> 08:14.633
Let's go.

08:14.666 --> 08:17.803
- What? Go where?
- Where else? My old house.

08:19.571 --> 08:22.574
You know the story
of how I was rounded up

08:22.608 --> 08:24.610
and drowned in Nellis falls?

08:24.643 --> 08:28.680
Well, on the anniversary of my death,

08:28.714 --> 08:31.550
the local kids, they dare each other

08:31.583 --> 08:35.086
to spend the night here
at our old farmhouse.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.489
This year

08:37.523 --> 08:40.926
I'm going to reappear.

08:40.958 --> 08:42.461
Home sweet home.

08:42.494 --> 08:45.163
Now do you own this?

08:45.196 --> 08:47.165
It's in a trust.

08:47.198 --> 08:50.436
Technically, if I came
forward, I could claim it.

08:51.470 --> 08:54.506
It used to get rented out
in the summers.

08:54.540 --> 08:57.108
Now a local cop looks after it

08:57.142 --> 09:00.111
every now and then.
Mostly it's empty.

09:00.145 --> 09:02.548
Now why don't
you live here then,

09:02.581 --> 09:04.816
instead of so far out of town?

09:04.850 --> 09:07.052
Because I can't.

09:07.085 --> 09:08.954
Because...

09:08.987 --> 09:11.623
because as far as the town
of Glen echo's concerned,

09:11.657 --> 09:14.860
- I'm dead, remember?
- Yeah.

09:14.893 --> 09:16.528
If this is where I'm gonna reappear,

09:16.562 --> 09:19.898
- I can't exactly be seen mowing the lawn.
- Yeah, gotcha.

09:24.603 --> 09:26.938
So then what function does it serve you?

09:26.972 --> 09:29.608
I am glad you asked.

09:29.641 --> 09:31.777
Step number one...

09:31.810 --> 09:34.012
I need an anchor for my legend.

09:34.045 --> 09:37.415
- Let's take a look at the apple orchard.
- Great.

09:38.717 --> 09:42.053
Creepy as hell, huh?

09:42.087 --> 09:44.856
Labyrinthine,

09:44.890 --> 09:46.492
cavernous.

09:46.525 --> 09:49.561
It's taken years to get like this.

09:49.595 --> 09:51.697
The story goes

09:51.730 --> 09:54.032
that if you go out into the field

09:54.065 --> 09:56.034
on the night of a harvest moon

09:56.067 --> 09:58.036
and till the soil,

09:58.069 --> 10:00.772
the dirt will come up wet

10:00.806 --> 10:02.874
- with blood.
- Cool.

10:02.908 --> 10:05.877
- Impossible to walk through.
- Todd...

10:07.546 --> 10:10.916
But it's even better.

10:10.949 --> 10:14.019
If you're brave enough

10:14.052 --> 10:17.589
to go out into the orchard

10:17.623 --> 10:19.691
on the night of a harvest moon

10:21.560 --> 10:23.562
and the night

10:23.595 --> 10:26.698
is still as death,

10:26.732 --> 10:29.768
you can still hear my mother's body

10:29.801 --> 10:31.937
swinging in the trees.

10:44.115 --> 10:45.551
I'm just kidding.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.619
- Wh...?
- I'm just kidding.

10:47.653 --> 10:50.088
Not tonight.

10:50.121 --> 10:52.257
We've got about a month to go.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.492
A month.

10:57.763 --> 11:00.732
You have no idea how much cardio

11:00.766 --> 11:03.068
I have to do.

11:03.101 --> 11:04.936
It's ridiculous.

11:04.970 --> 11:07.238
Why so much?

11:07.272 --> 11:09.741
Well, you oughta be able

11:09.775 --> 11:11.977
to run like a freaking gazelle

11:12.010 --> 11:13.912
without getting winded.

11:13.945 --> 11:16.582
And plus, there's that whole thing

11:16.615 --> 11:19.551
of making it look like you're walking

11:19.585 --> 11:21.720
when everybody else
is running their asses off.

11:21.753 --> 11:24.255
- Oh, right.
- And I gotta stay with 'em.

11:24.289 --> 11:26.324
Yeah.

11:26.357 --> 11:29.761
It's tough, man.
It's tough.

11:29.795 --> 11:31.597
Let's get to work.

11:31.630 --> 11:33.632
Come on.

11:34.966 --> 11:38.637
Okay, once you have a location lined up,

11:38.670 --> 11:40.639
then it's time to move on to step two...

11:40.672 --> 11:42.608
find a target group.

11:42.641 --> 11:45.644
A target group.
You mean victims?

11:46.778 --> 11:50.281
Potato, potah-to.

11:50.315 --> 11:53.284
Whatever. Anyway, it's not
as easy as you think.

11:53.318 --> 11:55.320
Everybody thinks we
just wake up one morning

11:55.353 --> 11:58.657
and start obsessing about a
girl and start stalking her,

11:58.690 --> 12:00.659
killing everybody that gets in the way.

12:00.692 --> 12:02.628
That does seem to happen
a lot with you guys.

12:02.661 --> 12:04.930
No, it's that...
no no.

12:04.963 --> 12:07.365
The girl's the key, yes,

12:07.398 --> 12:09.768
but she's gotta have a supporting cast.

12:09.801 --> 12:12.270
Like that bunch right there,

12:12.303 --> 12:14.272
there's your bread and butter...

12:14.305 --> 12:17.375
the good-looking,
athletic kids

12:17.408 --> 12:20.345
with healthy libidos.
Look.

12:20.378 --> 12:24.082
And those guys over there,

12:24.115 --> 12:27.653
they don't move quite as fast
when you get 'em on the run.

12:27.686 --> 12:31.623
So they're good to pad your
numbers with late in the game.

12:31.657 --> 12:34.793
Look at that guy.

12:34.826 --> 12:36.728
You gotta find a group who
will all hang together...

12:36.762 --> 12:39.297
a little from column "a",
a little from column "b"...

12:39.330 --> 12:41.332
and one survivor girl

12:41.366 --> 12:44.703
- who will tie 'em all together.
- What is a survivor girl?

12:44.736 --> 12:47.773
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's an industry term.

12:47.806 --> 12:50.742
It's what you call a girl...

12:50.776 --> 12:54.312
Like her, who just might be
able to walk away from me

12:54.345 --> 12:57.783
- at the end of the day.
- Okay, what is it about this girl?

12:59.050 --> 13:00.819
She's a virgin.

13:00.852 --> 13:03.321
A virgin.
How do you know that?

13:03.354 --> 13:05.691
How do the swallows find Capistrano?

13:05.724 --> 13:07.358
I don't know.

13:07.392 --> 13:09.895
Look at her.
She's a virgin.

13:09.928 --> 13:12.698
I mean, you're not getting that?

13:13.832 --> 13:15.834
Oh my God, did you get that?

13:15.867 --> 13:17.836
- Did you get that? Did you get that?
- Yeah.

13:17.869 --> 13:19.437
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it. I got it.

13:19.470 --> 13:21.740
Did you see that,
how we sensed each other?

13:21.773 --> 13:25.010
So you've been
tracking her already.

13:25.043 --> 13:26.745
Her? No, not her.

13:26.778 --> 13:28.780
No, I'm eyeing her for the first time.

13:28.814 --> 13:30.982
- No, I got a girl picked out in Glen echo.
- Oh.

13:31.016 --> 13:33.218
I just brought you out here
so you'd have a sense

13:33.251 --> 13:36.221
of what I've done so far.

13:36.254 --> 13:37.889
I mean...

13:37.923 --> 13:39.891
If I didn't have a girl
picked out already,

13:39.925 --> 13:42.293
we'd be way too far behind schedule.

13:42.327 --> 13:44.162
Ooh, it's like one of
those cooking shows, right,

13:44.195 --> 13:46.865
where they have the pie
already baking in the oven,

13:46.898 --> 13:48.867
sort of ready to go, you know?

13:48.900 --> 13:51.770
You ever... you ever
watch those s-s-shows?

13:51.803 --> 13:53.271
Sorry.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.340
- Doug.
- Never mind.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.179
Okay, so from this point on

14:01.212 --> 14:04.816
we're dealing directly with the
specifics of my gig at the farmhouse.

14:04.850 --> 14:06.384
This is the real deal now,

14:06.417 --> 14:09.855
and everything's
gotta go down just right.

14:09.888 --> 14:11.823
Uh, what are we here for?

14:13.391 --> 14:15.927
For her.

14:15.961 --> 14:18.129
Right there.

14:18.163 --> 14:21.933
Meet Kelly Curtis, my hopes and
dreams standing right there.

14:21.967 --> 14:25.403
- Is Kelly a virgin?
- Yep.

14:25.436 --> 14:29.107
- Can we talk to her?
- No, no way.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.109
I'm sorry, but there is
no wiggle room on this.

14:31.142 --> 14:32.978
- She is off-limits.
- Okay.

14:33.011 --> 14:35.781
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.991
And here we go.

14:47.192 --> 14:49.795
Hope you got film
in those cameras, boys.

14:49.828 --> 14:51.863
School's in.

14:53.564 --> 14:55.767
This is step three.

14:55.801 --> 14:57.035
It's called a "fly-by."

14:57.068 --> 14:58.970
Every night

14:59.004 --> 15:01.807
Kelly comes out this door,

15:01.840 --> 15:04.910
over to this dumpster,
drops off the garbage, okay?

15:04.943 --> 15:06.477
When she does that,

15:06.511 --> 15:09.915
she uses this brick
to prop open this door.

15:09.948 --> 15:12.383
You can see that I've rigged it
with some clear fishing line.

15:12.417 --> 15:15.520
Watch this. Ping!
Very strong.

15:15.553 --> 15:17.088
- Right.
- Usually I do this myself,

15:17.122 --> 15:19.891
but since you're here,
you're gonna help me.

15:19.925 --> 15:22.994
I'm gonna be sitting right over there

15:23.028 --> 15:25.363
in the darkness.
Kelly's gonna come out,

15:25.396 --> 15:27.465
take the garbage over
to the dumpster there.

15:27.498 --> 15:29.234
- Uh-huh.
- Right?

15:29.267 --> 15:31.236
I'm gonna pop out of the shadows there.

15:31.269 --> 15:34.372
She's gonna think she sees something.

15:34.405 --> 15:37.108
She's gonna take
a couple steps towards me.

15:37.142 --> 15:39.945
That's when you

15:39.978 --> 15:43.014
- give this a yank.
- Okay.

15:43.048 --> 15:44.916
Brick slides out, door slams shut.

15:44.950 --> 15:47.285
Boom! She turns!

15:50.388 --> 15:52.991
I slip back into the shadows.

15:53.024 --> 15:56.161
She turns back around.

15:56.194 --> 15:57.528
- And you've...
- I'm gone.

15:57.562 --> 15:59.865
- You've disappeared.
- Right.

15:59.898 --> 16:01.566
All right?

16:01.599 --> 16:03.902
- Sounds good.
- All right.

16:05.103 --> 16:08.173
Here we go.

16:15.947 --> 16:18.917
God, that was amazing.

16:18.950 --> 16:22.053
Leslie, how did you do that, man?

16:22.087 --> 16:25.023
- Todd, keep up.
- Don't be an uber-bitch. I'm right here.

16:25.056 --> 16:28.126
All right, that is it. Gimme a pound.
Gimme a little bow.

16:28.159 --> 16:29.995
- Who's bowing?
- Todd needs a pound.

16:30.028 --> 16:33.398
Pound it, bow it.
All right, and you...

16:33.431 --> 16:35.967
- you get hugs.
- Oh, okay.

16:36.001 --> 16:38.436
Huggy. Oh...

16:38.469 --> 16:41.239
- All right, let's get in. Whoo-hoo!
- Okay. All right.

16:41.272 --> 16:44.109
She thinks she saw me.
Maybe not. She's not sure.

16:44.142 --> 16:46.377
Just wanna get her a
little paranoid, you know?

16:46.411 --> 16:49.147
Just plant the seed

16:49.180 --> 16:51.883
that there might be some trouble coming.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.585
You know what I mean?
Get in, come on.

16:54.619 --> 16:57.222
Yo yo yo, who's that guy over there, man?

16:57.255 --> 16:58.924
Who knows?

16:58.957 --> 17:01.192
So where are we headed now?

17:01.226 --> 17:02.994
To visit my two best friends,

17:03.028 --> 17:06.064
Eugene and his wife, Jamie.
They live just down the road.

17:06.097 --> 17:09.067
Eugene is an old pro in the biz.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.036
He's retired now, though,

17:11.069 --> 17:14.039
but he taught me a lot.

17:14.071 --> 17:15.973
Gener!

17:16.007 --> 17:17.976
I figured it'd be good for
you to meet with him,

17:18.009 --> 17:19.676
you know, give you some perspective,

17:19.710 --> 17:22.948
kind of a bridge between the past

17:22.981 --> 17:25.083
and the future.

17:27.617 --> 17:30.521
Plus, Jamie's fucking hot.

17:30.555 --> 17:34.059
- Hey! How are you doing, Jamie?
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?

17:34.092 --> 17:36.494
- Good. What's all this?
- It's just some grad-school kids

17:36.527 --> 17:38.196
following me around.

17:38.229 --> 17:40.365
- Taylor Gentry.
- Oh, yeah. Hi. This is the thing

17:40.398 --> 17:43.468
you were telling me about. Come
on in, everyone. Is that on?

17:43.501 --> 17:46.337
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
You look great.

17:46.371 --> 17:49.307
- I'm embarrassed.
- Don't be.

17:49.340 --> 17:52.010
- Is gene around?
- Yeah, he's out back in the tank.

17:52.043 --> 17:54.479
And you should probably go get
him, 'cause I keep forgetting.

17:54.512 --> 17:57.315
- I'm busy, and he's been out there a while, so...
- Okay.

17:59.017 --> 18:01.419
- What are you doing?
- Eugene is in a tank...

18:01.452 --> 18:03.989
a sensory-deprivation
chamber,

18:04.022 --> 18:06.524
you know, like those big tubes.

18:06.557 --> 18:10.128
- Just start over there.
- So why do you do this?

18:10.161 --> 18:12.297
It helps you control
your bodily functions,

18:12.330 --> 18:16.034
you know, like those yoga guys
who can slow their breathing,

18:16.067 --> 18:19.170
slow their heart rate down to, like,
four beats a minute or whatever.

18:19.204 --> 18:21.639
It's good to be able to do that

18:21.672 --> 18:24.342
in case you need to look...

18:24.375 --> 18:27.012
You know, dead.

18:27.045 --> 18:30.648
- You mentioned your friend is retired.
- Yep.

18:30.681 --> 18:34.485
Why does he still need to do this?

18:34.519 --> 18:36.321
I have no idea.

18:44.762 --> 18:46.264
Oh my God.

18:47.298 --> 18:49.500
How are you doing, old timer?

18:51.269 --> 18:53.471
What time is it?

18:53.504 --> 18:55.706
It's about 6:00.

18:55.740 --> 18:58.476
- 6:30, quarter to 7:00?
- Yeah.

18:58.509 --> 19:01.446
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday?

19:01.479 --> 19:04.115
Tuesday? Hell, no,
man, it's Thursday!

19:04.149 --> 19:07.218
Jamie, Jamie, you didn't say he
was down here for three days.

19:07.252 --> 19:08.686
Come on, up up.

19:08.719 --> 19:10.688
- Get your feet under you. Good.
- Easy does it.

19:10.721 --> 19:12.757
Easy does it.
Easy does it.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.459
You been down for a while.

19:14.492 --> 19:18.063
- Careful. Get your legs on.
- Oh my God.

19:18.096 --> 19:21.532
Do you see what I mean? He's the best.

19:21.566 --> 19:23.234
That is so great, Les.

19:23.268 --> 19:25.103
It sounds like Kelly's really
coming around for you.

19:25.136 --> 19:27.105
I am very optimistic about it.

19:27.138 --> 19:29.107
Everything comes together
when it's right.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.476
So, Jamie, you support Leslie

19:31.509 --> 19:33.478
in what he's trying to do?

19:33.511 --> 19:36.414
Of course. You see how
hard he's worked for it.

19:36.447 --> 19:38.783
And do I wish he'd chosen
something a little safer

19:38.816 --> 19:41.086
to do with his life?
Sure.

19:41.119 --> 19:43.321
But he knows what's best for him.

19:43.354 --> 19:45.756
Hey there, old timer.

19:45.790 --> 19:48.259
How are you doing?

19:48.293 --> 19:51.129
Nothing like a cold shower to
get the blood pumping again.

19:51.162 --> 19:53.498
- Oh, yeah,
- how's your beer?

19:53.531 --> 19:56.634
Very good, thank you.
Highly recommend it.

19:56.667 --> 20:00.105
- You want one?
- I'm gonna go with no.

20:00.138 --> 20:02.039
- No. Okay.
- Thank you.

20:03.474 --> 20:06.377
- Well, when are we gonna eat?
- Hi.

20:06.411 --> 20:08.479
As soon as you chop up these veggies

20:08.513 --> 20:11.349
- and get the grill ready.
- Okay.

20:11.382 --> 20:13.151
Yeah.

20:15.620 --> 20:17.722
So, Eugene,

20:17.755 --> 20:19.757
Leslie tells us you're retired.

20:19.790 --> 20:23.128
Is it all right to talk about this?

20:23.161 --> 20:25.630
Oh, yeah. I told her that you
could give her a history

20:25.663 --> 20:29.300
of what it was like in the old days.

20:29.334 --> 20:30.601
Oh, shoot.

20:30.635 --> 20:33.438
It was a whole different world
back when I was in the game.

20:33.471 --> 20:35.773
How so?

20:35.806 --> 20:37.875
Well, I had a good portion

20:37.908 --> 20:41.412
of my success in the late '60s, '70s.

20:41.446 --> 20:45.183
Back then it was about quantity of work.

20:45.216 --> 20:47.385
How many jobs can you fit in a year?

20:47.418 --> 20:49.520
How many places can you hit?

20:49.554 --> 20:52.323
You know, we didn't have

20:52.357 --> 20:54.892
all this preparation
these guys use today.

20:54.925 --> 20:56.627
But the good ones do anyway.

20:56.661 --> 20:59.297
That's true.

20:59.330 --> 21:02.167
There's always been hacks out there,

21:02.200 --> 21:04.435
people mucking it up,

21:04.469 --> 21:06.637
one-hit wonders
who make a bloody mess

21:06.671 --> 21:09.274
of some sorority somewhere,

21:09.307 --> 21:11.842
get killed

21:11.876 --> 21:14.545
or arrested.

21:14.579 --> 21:17.482
You can never put it together again.

21:17.515 --> 21:19.384
Makes it bad for all of us...

21:19.417 --> 21:21.419
Just cheapens it.

21:23.654 --> 21:25.790
That's... that's great, honey.

21:25.823 --> 21:28.726
Why don't you go start the grill?

21:28.759 --> 21:31.296
- I will.
- Okay.

21:33.598 --> 21:37.302
So you mentioned most of the guys
in your line of work today are...

21:37.335 --> 21:39.337
Uh, hacks.

21:39.370 --> 21:42.807
I'm not talking about the
guys that really worked hard,

21:42.840 --> 21:45.910
like Jay and Fred and Mike.

21:45.943 --> 21:48.613
There weren't nobody like
them in the early years.

21:48.646 --> 21:52.417
We just hit hard, wiped everybody out

21:52.450 --> 21:54.452
and disappeared as soon as we could

21:54.485 --> 21:57.222
without ever giving
a thought to coming back.

21:57.255 --> 22:01.292
Those boys lifted it
to a whole other level.

22:01.326 --> 22:03.361
They made an art form of it,

22:03.394 --> 22:05.263
turned themselves into legends

22:05.296 --> 22:09.234
by returning like a curse
over and over again.

22:09.267 --> 22:12.203
That was a radical change in philosophy,

22:12.237 --> 22:14.205
changed the whole business.

22:14.239 --> 22:18.175
The business of supernatural
killing sprees?

22:19.377 --> 22:22.647
She's not exactly on board yet

22:22.680 --> 22:27.385
with the whole
why-we-do-what-we-do thing.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.921
No, young lady,

22:30.955 --> 22:33.858
about the business of fear.

22:34.925 --> 22:37.562
Every culture, every civilization

22:37.595 --> 22:41.266
from the dawn of man
has had its monsters.

22:41.299 --> 22:44.369
For good to be pitted against evil,

22:44.402 --> 22:47.838
you have to have evil, don't you?

22:47.872 --> 22:50.641
- Here's your doggy bag.
- Thank you so much.

22:50.675 --> 22:52.643
- Thank you, Jamie.
- You're welcome.

22:52.677 --> 22:55.446
Now I feel like we didn't
even have a chance to talk.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.749
How's that thing, the
one you're working on?

22:58.783 --> 23:00.751
Really good.
Really good.

23:00.785 --> 23:02.920
I was telling Jamie earlier that I think

23:02.953 --> 23:04.922
this girl's really coming alone.

23:04.955 --> 23:07.358
You got your red
herring all worked out?

23:07.392 --> 23:08.659
I think so.
I think so.

23:08.693 --> 23:10.661
She spends a lot of time at the library.

23:10.695 --> 23:12.397
So I was gonna do it there.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.333
She knows the janitor or somebody?

23:15.366 --> 23:17.835
- Do you wanna walk us out?
- Sure.

23:20.971 --> 23:23.274
Thank you, sir.

23:24.509 --> 23:28.012
I was gonna knock off
one of her friends.

23:28.045 --> 23:30.581
Oh, I don't know about that, son.

23:30.615 --> 23:33.017
I wouldn't burn that one too quick.

23:33.050 --> 23:36.654
- It turns the heat up too much.
- Right.

23:36.687 --> 23:39.324
Is there anybody else available?
Does she talk to anybody,

23:39.357 --> 23:41.459
a homeless person
on the way or anything?

23:41.492 --> 23:43.628
Well, hey, how about a librarian?

23:43.661 --> 23:46.464
If she spends a lot of time there,
I'm sure she knows a few of them.

23:46.497 --> 23:48.366
Now that's a good idea right there, Les.

23:48.399 --> 23:50.501
There's a lady there

23:50.535 --> 23:52.503
who lets her stay late sometimes.

23:52.537 --> 23:55.039
Jackpot. You got a winner.

23:55.072 --> 23:57.041
Yeah yeah.

23:57.074 --> 23:59.877
- Yeah, I'm gonna look into that.
- You do that.

23:59.910 --> 24:02.647
- All right, now...
- You keep us posted.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.482
Jinx, you owe me a soda.

24:04.515 --> 24:07.518
- Oh, Eugene! Got me again.
- I will.

24:07.552 --> 24:09.987
Leslie, what's a red herring?

24:10.020 --> 24:11.889
It's a...

24:11.922 --> 24:14.459
Preliminary strike

24:14.492 --> 24:17.027
involving Kelly indirectly.

24:17.061 --> 24:19.029
"Strike" meaning

24:19.063 --> 24:21.399
the first person you are gonna kill?

24:21.432 --> 24:23.501
Mm-hmm.

24:33.110 --> 24:36.914
Next step is...

24:36.947 --> 24:40.551
I gotta get this...

24:40.585 --> 24:42.553
Into Kelly's hands.

24:42.587 --> 24:45.556
- What is that?
- This is an article

24:45.590 --> 24:47.792
about the suspect

24:47.825 --> 24:51.028
who was questioned
in the rape of my mom.

24:51.061 --> 24:53.364
"Mark Daniel Curtis."

24:53.398 --> 24:55.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Is he related to Kelly?

24:55.533 --> 24:57.835
That's her great-Uncle.

24:57.868 --> 24:59.837
Well, supposedly.

24:59.870 --> 25:02.473
Wow, he looks just like her.

25:02.507 --> 25:04.575
It is her.

25:04.609 --> 25:06.577
It's a computer-generated
image.

25:06.611 --> 25:09.747
Pretty good, huh?

25:09.780 --> 25:12.917
She doesn't have a great-Uncle,
at least not that I know of.

25:12.950 --> 25:15.420
So what, you made that up?

25:15.453 --> 25:17.455
A lot of what we use
is C.G.I.

25:17.488 --> 25:19.924
- Hey, Doug, can you step out front?
- You bet.

25:19.957 --> 25:22.527
Thank you.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.563
All right, kids, we are at
the point of no return.

25:26.964 --> 25:29.800
You can either bag it and go
home with a clear conscience

25:29.834 --> 25:31.836
or you can come inside.

25:33.203 --> 25:35.406
What's it gonna be, stay or go?

25:41.712 --> 25:44.181
So how will this play out?
How will this work?

25:44.214 --> 25:46.183
I don't know that it will.

25:46.216 --> 25:48.185
I just put it in front of her

25:48.218 --> 25:50.888
and hope she takes it

25:50.921 --> 25:53.524
and connects the dots.

25:53.558 --> 25:55.159
It's another test

25:55.192 --> 25:59.096
to see if we're on the same page.

25:59.129 --> 26:02.533
In fact, a lot of what happens
from here on out,

26:02.567 --> 26:06.136
the success or failure
of it, depends on her,

26:06.170 --> 26:08.539
on what she does.

26:08.573 --> 26:11.075
Stay put.
I'll be right back.

26:13.243 --> 26:15.746
Go go go!

26:17.582 --> 26:21.018
- Don't you see him?
- I lost him. I'm sorry.

26:21.051 --> 26:23.087
There he is.

26:26.223 --> 26:28.192
Look at him. He's
like a little monkey.

26:28.225 --> 26:31.729
Just stay focused. Go!

26:39.770 --> 26:43.007
Keep it down, Todd.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.811
- Don't sneak up like that.
- Like the freaking town crier over here.

26:46.844 --> 26:49.514
Whoa whoa whoa.
What's this?

26:49.547 --> 26:51.949
Oh, all the newspaper articles

26:51.982 --> 26:54.819
are kept on microfiche.

26:54.852 --> 26:57.655
I swapped the real one out

26:57.688 --> 26:59.256
for the fake one that had the story

26:59.289 --> 27:01.759
about Kelly's great-Uncle.

27:01.792 --> 27:04.261
If everything goes right...

27:04.294 --> 27:06.831
and it never does...
but if it does,

27:06.864 --> 27:08.699
she's gonna read the newspaper clipping

27:08.733 --> 27:11.536
and wanna read the rest of the article.

27:11.569 --> 27:14.238
She's gonna go
to the librarian for help.

27:14.271 --> 27:17.608
Then they're gonna go to the microfiche.

27:17.642 --> 27:20.110
They're gonna read about the
Curtis family connection.

27:20.144 --> 27:23.013
Then Kelly is going to freak.

27:23.047 --> 27:25.015
Then the librarian's
gonna say something like,

27:25.049 --> 27:27.017
"it's okay, dear.

27:27.051 --> 27:29.286
It's just
an old story."

27:29.319 --> 27:31.055
And then...

27:31.088 --> 27:33.691
I make my appearance.

27:35.325 --> 27:38.996
It is going to get wet in here tonight.

27:39.029 --> 27:41.031
Lace your boots up, kiddies.

27:42.299 --> 27:45.202
"Paradise lost"...

27:45.235 --> 27:47.872
found it.

27:47.905 --> 27:51.642
All right, keep the cameras rolling.

27:52.643 --> 27:54.612
After I've offed the librarian,

27:54.645 --> 27:56.614
I'm gonna chase Kelly
around for a little bit.

27:56.647 --> 27:58.749
Then I'm gonna let her go.
You wait for my signal.

27:58.783 --> 28:01.819
When you get it, just
haul ass back to the van.

28:01.852 --> 28:03.988
- Got it?
- Got it.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.927
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.096
Thank you.

28:12.129 --> 28:14.832
Todd, Todd, come in.

28:14.865 --> 28:16.834
We got company.

28:16.867 --> 28:18.869
Who the fuck is this guy?

28:22.640 --> 28:24.775
She is hot.

28:24.809 --> 28:28.112
Todd, would you keep
the camera on her face?

28:32.717 --> 28:34.919
- She's getting up.
- So am I.

28:34.952 --> 28:37.287
Ugh, seriously.

28:37.321 --> 28:39.890
- She strides like a gazelle.
- Todd.

28:44.929 --> 28:47.932
Really, he's got good taste.
Look how hot she is.

28:49.900 --> 28:52.603
- I can't believe that actually worked.
- Awesome.

28:52.637 --> 28:55.339
Make sure you're getting this.

28:59.777 --> 29:02.913
Mrs. Collinwood, would you help
me find the rest of this article?

29:05.349 --> 29:06.984
Oh, my goodness.

29:07.017 --> 29:09.820
This must be 30 years old.

29:09.854 --> 29:11.656
Someone must have brought it in

29:11.689 --> 29:14.358
and left it by mistake.

29:14.391 --> 29:17.394
- It's not the library's?
- Oh, heaven's no.

29:17.427 --> 29:19.697
We don't keep papers this old.

29:19.730 --> 29:22.667
We scan them into the computer now.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.235
But something like this might still be

29:25.269 --> 29:27.071
on microfiche.

29:37.247 --> 29:41.118
"Mark Daniel Curtis, described as a
vagabond drifter, was questioned

29:41.151 --> 29:43.253
by Glen echo police Tuesday morning

29:43.287 --> 29:45.923
for the brutal rape
of Molly Vernon."

29:45.956 --> 29:48.693
Curtis.

29:48.726 --> 29:51.762
Are you related to this man?

29:51.796 --> 29:53.898
Do you know the story of the boy

29:53.931 --> 29:55.900
in the Vernon farmhouse,
Mrs. Collinwood?

29:55.933 --> 29:59.069
Oh, goodness, everybody knows about...

30:00.470 --> 30:03.808
never you mind.
It's just a story.

30:03.841 --> 30:06.711
No, I want to know what happened.

30:07.812 --> 30:09.980
Here we are.

30:11.916 --> 30:13.784
It's a wedding photo.

30:13.818 --> 30:17.054
"Mr. and Mrs. Vernon
on their wedding day."

30:17.087 --> 30:19.289
That's the first and last photograph

30:19.323 --> 30:21.759
you'll ever see of them.

30:21.792 --> 30:23.393
They were a strange couple.

30:23.427 --> 30:27.064
They kept entirely to themselves.

30:27.097 --> 30:29.099
After that night...

30:29.133 --> 30:32.302
nine months after that night, in fact,

30:32.336 --> 30:34.705
Molly Vernon gave birth

30:34.739 --> 30:36.373
to a bastard son.

30:36.406 --> 30:39.877
- Oh my God.
- He was horribly abused.

30:39.910 --> 30:42.913
He was forced to live in the cider house

30:42.947 --> 30:45.049
and driven like a slave

30:45.082 --> 30:46.817
to till the fields

30:46.851 --> 30:49.419
with only a hand scythe.

30:49.453 --> 30:53.290
One day, legend has it,

30:53.323 --> 30:55.860
the boy revolted.

30:55.893 --> 30:58.796
Beneath a blood-red
harvest moon,

30:58.829 --> 31:02.332
he murdered Silas with a hand scythe,

31:02.366 --> 31:04.969
buried his body in the fields

31:05.002 --> 31:07.872
and dragged Molly from the house,

31:07.905 --> 31:11.909
hanging her in the farm's apple orchard.

31:12.977 --> 31:14.912
When the crimes were discovered,

31:14.945 --> 31:17.247
the incensed townspeople

31:17.281 --> 31:19.850
marched upon the farmhouse,

31:19.884 --> 31:22.887
dragged the boy from the house,

31:22.920 --> 31:24.889
bound his hands

31:24.922 --> 31:27.992
and marched him over the falls

31:28.025 --> 31:30.527
to the banks of the Nellis river,

31:30.560 --> 31:34.464
where he vanished into the icy waters.

31:34.498 --> 31:36.834
Did they ever find the boy's body?

31:36.867 --> 31:40.971
Water that cold,
bodies don't come back up.

31:41.005 --> 31:43.808
Turtles picked his bones clean.

31:43.841 --> 31:45.810
If this is
my great-Uncle

31:45.843 --> 31:48.545
who raped her, that would
make the boy my...

31:48.578 --> 31:52.382
Now you listen here.
The boy drowned.

31:52.416 --> 31:55.085
You have nothing to worry about.

32:00.024 --> 32:01.992
Leslie!

32:02.026 --> 32:04.829
No more.
It ends here.

32:09.033 --> 32:11.401
Come to me, child.
It's all right.

32:21.912 --> 32:23.881
Whoo! Whoo!

32:25.950 --> 32:27.952
Did you get that? You got it?
You got it?

32:27.985 --> 32:29.453
- We totally got it.
- You got the guy coming out?

32:29.486 --> 32:32.522
- You got the guy, right? You got the guy?
- We got the whole thing.

32:32.556 --> 32:35.025
Leslie, Taylor:
Whoo! Whoo!

32:35.059 --> 32:37.327
- We got an Ahab!
- Whoa, we got an Ahab!

32:37.361 --> 32:39.163
What's an Ahab?

32:39.196 --> 32:42.366
It's a guy. It's a guy
like the guy back there.

32:42.399 --> 32:44.168
Get in. We gotta tell Eugene.

32:44.201 --> 32:46.036
Oh! He shot you?

32:46.070 --> 32:48.873
- Right in the shoulder.
- That's your first one. Does it hurt?

32:48.906 --> 32:50.941
Oh, no, it feels all right.
I was wearing a vest.

32:50.975 --> 32:52.910
It's fine.
There he is.

32:52.943 --> 32:56.013
I'll be damned. Doc Halloran.

32:56.046 --> 32:59.216
- Right when you need him.
- It's unbelievable.

33:01.151 --> 33:03.854
It looks like you got your Ahab.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.294
Leslie, who is Doc Halloran?

33:10.327 --> 33:12.296
He's a psychiatrist.

33:12.329 --> 33:14.131
Um, he visited me when I was little.

33:14.164 --> 33:16.967
And after Leslie took off,
Doc Halloran always predicted

33:17.001 --> 33:20.437
- he would come back.
- So you're gonna go after him now?

33:20.470 --> 33:23.007
Wh... no. Hell no.
I need him.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.374
Why?
Why do you need him?

33:24.408 --> 33:26.376
Because he is an Ahab,

33:26.410 --> 33:28.378
and that is a remarkable thing.

33:28.412 --> 33:31.281
You're gonna have to define an Ahab.

33:31.315 --> 33:33.918
Okay okay, an Ahab in this context

33:33.951 --> 33:37.021
is a reflection of everything
that is good in humanity,

33:37.054 --> 33:40.024
someone who is willing to
defend others against evil

33:40.057 --> 33:42.927
even at a great personal cost.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.463
He knows what I am. He
knows what I'll be doing.

33:46.496 --> 33:50.000
He will stop at nothing
to try and stop me.

33:50.034 --> 33:52.136
This is such great news.

33:52.169 --> 33:55.205
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

33:55.239 --> 33:56.974
The boy needs to focus.

33:57.007 --> 33:59.043
Oh, gene, he's got an Ahab!

33:59.076 --> 34:01.111
You can't get a little excited?

34:01.145 --> 34:04.081
We are so proud of him.
We're very proud of him.

34:04.114 --> 34:06.583
I would just like
to state for the record

34:06.616 --> 34:08.585
what an enormously bad idea this is.

34:08.618 --> 34:11.420
Todd, I just need to know, okay?

34:25.402 --> 34:27.471
Hi, everyone, how are you?

34:27.504 --> 34:29.940
- Coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

34:29.974 --> 34:32.275
I'll be back for your order.

34:32.309 --> 34:34.043
What are you waiting for?

34:34.078 --> 34:36.179
Look, Todd, when she comes back,

34:36.213 --> 34:38.949
I'll ask her. Just be cool, all right?

34:42.485 --> 34:44.955
Uh-oh.

34:48.125 --> 34:50.995
Oh, God.

34:51.027 --> 34:54.031
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. What do I say?
- Just act normal.

34:55.264 --> 34:58.002
It's the opposite of what
you're doing right now.

35:01.171 --> 35:03.407
Why are you following this girl?

35:03.440 --> 35:07.011
- Who are you people?
- We're just sitting here, man.

35:07.044 --> 35:08.578
Oh, really?

35:08.612 --> 35:12.549
- Why are you filming this?
- Uh, who are you?

35:12.582 --> 35:14.584
Okay, why do you need to know that?

35:17.121 --> 35:19.689
You know where he is, don't you?

35:19.723 --> 35:22.392
He's not who you think he is.

35:22.426 --> 35:25.762
What's he calling
himself now, Leslie Vernon?

35:25.795 --> 35:28.165
How perfect.

35:28.198 --> 35:30.467
I... I...
I don't know.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.302
I don't know who that is.

35:32.336 --> 35:35.639
His name is Leslie Mancuso

35:35.672 --> 35:38.042
from Reno, Nevada.

35:38.075 --> 35:41.778
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

35:41.811 --> 35:44.414
What's going on?

35:44.448 --> 35:48.185
Miss, I believe these people
wish to speak with you.

35:48.218 --> 35:49.719
Actually, no.

35:49.753 --> 35:53.157
We're... we need to go,
but thank you anyway.

35:53.190 --> 35:55.292
And it was nice to meet you, Mister...

35:55.325 --> 35:58.095
...Doctor. Dr. Halloran.

35:59.329 --> 36:02.099
Expect to see more of me.

36:02.132 --> 36:05.001
Excuse us. Todd, let's go.

36:06.170 --> 36:09.073
- Oh, shit.
- You wanna just pretend

36:09.106 --> 36:11.075
that we've already had the conversation

36:11.108 --> 36:12.742
- we're about to have?
- Leslie...

36:12.776 --> 36:15.345
okay, that's your portion of it
right there. Now here's mine.

36:15.379 --> 36:17.447
You asked if you could
talk to her, I told you,

36:17.481 --> 36:19.649
"no, you'll
fuck it up."

36:19.683 --> 36:23.120
God damn it.

36:23.153 --> 36:25.422
I've shown you pearls,

36:25.455 --> 36:28.558
shit no one's ever seen.

36:28.592 --> 36:31.195
If you wanna pack it up and go home,

36:31.228 --> 36:33.630
that is fine. It's not gonna
affect what I have to do.

36:33.663 --> 36:37.201
And frankly, I'll be glad not
dragging you fuckers along anymore.

36:38.635 --> 36:42.639
But don't ruin...

36:44.174 --> 36:46.276
My life's work.

36:46.310 --> 36:48.645
Don't do it.

36:51.181 --> 36:53.283
Trust.

36:53.317 --> 36:56.253
Taylor, where's the trust?

36:56.286 --> 36:57.687
- Trust?
- Yes!

36:57.721 --> 36:59.356
Oh, yeah, right.

36:59.389 --> 37:01.725
Where is it?
Coming from you?

37:01.758 --> 37:03.727
Who is that guy?

37:03.760 --> 37:05.729
Who is Doc Halloran, Leslie?

37:05.762 --> 37:09.266
- And who are you really, come to think of it?
- Get in the van.

37:09.299 --> 37:12.202
- We're not gonna have this conversation in the street.
- You think he might come out

37:12.236 --> 37:13.670
- and shoot you again?
- Get in the van!

37:13.703 --> 37:15.472
Ever live in Reno, Leslie?

37:18.808 --> 37:20.477
That's enough.

37:27.451 --> 37:30.754
You win.

37:32.256 --> 37:35.225
I'll tell you everything

37:35.259 --> 37:36.793
you need to know.

37:36.826 --> 37:38.862
Okay?

37:40.697 --> 37:42.799
Yeah.

37:42.832 --> 37:45.335
Now please,

37:45.369 --> 37:47.404
get in the van.

37:51.175 --> 37:53.477
You've never lived in Glen echo.

37:53.510 --> 37:55.812
You're not Molly Vernon's son.

37:55.845 --> 37:59.816
Then who is Doc Halloran?

37:59.849 --> 38:02.352
Doc Halloran

38:02.386 --> 38:04.254
is a shrink who treated me in Reno.

38:04.288 --> 38:06.523
And I left there to come
here, so I could do this.

38:06.556 --> 38:09.393
And why doesn't he turn you in

38:09.426 --> 38:12.596
if he knows the truth?

38:12.629 --> 38:14.731
Because I...

38:14.764 --> 38:16.600
I set him up.

38:16.633 --> 38:18.935
I filed a restraining order against him.

38:18.968 --> 38:20.804
And if he tries to turn me in,

38:20.837 --> 38:22.572
he'll be arrested.

38:22.606 --> 38:24.908
You used me!

38:24.941 --> 38:27.577
How can you even think
this is about you, though?

38:27.611 --> 38:30.680
This is...

38:30.714 --> 38:32.816
this is my life.

38:32.849 --> 38:34.718
Taylor, this is my life.

38:34.751 --> 38:37.354
So the backstories are fake.

38:37.387 --> 38:39.489
So what?

38:41.425 --> 38:44.928
If you can't stay,

38:44.961 --> 38:47.163
I understand.

38:58.908 --> 39:01.245
Turn it off.

39:01.278 --> 39:04.214
So what's next?

39:04.248 --> 39:06.216
Either stay or go...
what are we gonna do?

39:06.250 --> 39:08.252
Todd, just stop pushing, man.

39:08.285 --> 39:12.188
- Shut up, Doug.
- Just let her think.

40:10.747 --> 40:14.318
You know what? This is what
I've chosen to do, so...

40:15.952 --> 40:18.922
Let's see it through.

40:18.955 --> 40:21.725
Yes! Sweet. We're staying.

40:25.729 --> 40:29.566
Welcome to my
allegedly ancestral home.

40:31.335 --> 40:33.337
You wanna limit your time inside

40:33.370 --> 40:35.839
- as much as possible.
- Why is that?

40:35.872 --> 40:37.341
Restricts your mobility.

40:37.374 --> 40:40.910
You wanna keep your eye on
everything at the same time.

40:40.944 --> 40:43.480
The worst thing is if you get
in a game of hide and seek.

40:43.513 --> 40:45.415
That really slows you down.

40:45.449 --> 40:47.751
Now if they
hide in the closet...

40:47.784 --> 40:50.754
- Why not just reach in and grab 'em?
- Yeah.

40:50.787 --> 40:53.357
We have a code of ethics, Tay.

40:53.390 --> 40:56.025
The closet...

40:56.059 --> 40:58.928
Is a sacred place.

41:01.130 --> 41:03.467
It's symbolic of the womb.

41:03.500 --> 41:07.471
It's the safest place to be,
because in the womb

41:07.504 --> 41:09.506
we're innocent.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.610
So does that mean you're
pro-life, Leslie?

41:16.780 --> 41:19.115
Anyway, you don't want
to spend too much time

41:19.148 --> 41:20.650
on just one person.

41:20.684 --> 41:22.886
Gives everybody else
too much time to get away,

41:22.919 --> 41:24.921
and that's rule number one...

41:24.954 --> 41:28.425
nobody gets away.

41:28.458 --> 41:29.893
You mess that one up,

41:29.926 --> 41:32.829
and not only is it a complete breakdown,

41:32.862 --> 41:34.931
it's really embarrassing.

41:34.964 --> 41:37.033
The bedroom is where
it's all gonna start.

41:37.066 --> 41:39.569
If it all goes as I expect,

41:39.603 --> 41:41.505
one guy's gonna bring his girl up here

41:41.538 --> 41:43.072
to knock boots,

41:43.106 --> 41:46.042
and of course I'll be waiting nearby.

41:46.075 --> 41:49.446
This is my staging area.

41:49.479 --> 41:51.080
I'll wait here for them

41:51.114 --> 41:54.984
to start doing their thing,

41:55.018 --> 41:57.654
and then it's decision time.

41:57.687 --> 42:00.590
What's a "go" situation?

42:00.624 --> 42:02.826
If I have a good sense
of the way things are going,

42:02.859 --> 42:04.494
if I know where everyone's at.

42:04.528 --> 42:08.432
Once I off the two of them,
I'll stage the area

42:08.465 --> 42:12.035
- and make it look like they're sleeping.
- Why is that?

42:12.068 --> 42:14.037
Well, if someone comes in

42:14.070 --> 42:16.673
and sees two horrifically
mangled bodies,

42:16.706 --> 42:18.675
they'll run screaming from the house.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.444
I'll lose containment way too early.

42:20.477 --> 42:23.146
As soon as possible
I gotta whittle it down

42:23.179 --> 42:24.781
to just me and Kelly.

42:24.814 --> 42:27.451
I have...

42:27.484 --> 42:30.153
The main fuse rigged up
to cut the power.

42:32.556 --> 42:35.725
Hmm? So I can sneak
down the stairs

42:35.759 --> 42:38.027
and take advantage of the first moments

42:38.061 --> 42:39.863
of chaos.

42:41.598 --> 42:43.032
Of course, one
of the first reactions

42:43.066 --> 42:45.535
will be to go for the
flashlights in the kitchen.

42:45.569 --> 42:47.737
I put dead batteries in all them.

42:47.771 --> 42:51.675
So that'll mean they have to
go down to the basement

42:51.708 --> 42:55.111
to check the fuse box. Remember, nobody
knows about the bodies upstairs,

42:55.144 --> 42:57.481
so they won't be panicked.

42:57.514 --> 42:59.182
Here's how it'll go down next...

42:59.215 --> 43:01.551
Everybody will be partying.

43:01.585 --> 43:03.987
Kelly won't be having
any of it, hopefully.

43:04.020 --> 43:07.557
Her jock boyfriend's gonna get
frustrated, take it out on the Stoners.

43:07.591 --> 43:10.627
The Stoners are gonna be stoned.

43:10.660 --> 43:12.896
And then the lights will go out.

43:12.929 --> 43:16.032
One of the guys will offer to go to the cellar,

43:16.065 --> 43:18.535
and being a raging sack of hormones,

43:18.568 --> 43:20.570
he'll bring his girl to try to score.

43:32.616 --> 43:35.184
Oh, Leslie.

43:35.218 --> 43:37.186
Don't you think that's
a little gratuitous?

43:37.220 --> 43:39.489
- Now, Taylor...
- Oh, yeah.

43:39.523 --> 43:41.558
...who's telling
the story?

43:45.862 --> 43:48.932
That's my cue to split 'em up.

43:48.965 --> 43:51.568
He'll tell her to stay put
while he checks it out.

43:51.601 --> 43:53.637
- He'll say, "everything's all right."
- Honey?

43:53.670 --> 43:54.971
And then...

43:56.940 --> 43:59.943
You let her go?

43:59.976 --> 44:01.578
She's the starting gun.

44:01.611 --> 44:04.614
She'll run screaming back into
the house and start the panic.

44:04.648 --> 44:06.215
That gives me time to make my next move.

44:06.249 --> 44:08.618
There's no lock on that old toolshed

44:08.652 --> 44:10.554
so I'll use the corpse

44:10.587 --> 44:13.590
to scare the poop out of the
kid who goes in there next.

44:13.623 --> 44:17.193
The shed's a safe haven.
I can't let anyone in.

44:17.226 --> 44:18.928
- The closet imagery.
- Right.

44:18.962 --> 44:20.630
Only Kelly's allowed in there.

44:20.664 --> 44:22.566
If someone else tries
to enter that shed,

44:22.599 --> 44:24.601
he gets it with a posthole digger.

44:25.935 --> 44:28.037
It's so sadistic

44:28.071 --> 44:30.540
and yet...

44:30.574 --> 44:31.708
Genius.

44:31.741 --> 44:33.577
Thank you.

44:33.610 --> 44:37.547
But, uh, you do want
Kelly to go in there?

44:38.715 --> 44:41.250
- Yes.
- You're kidding. What for?

44:41.284 --> 44:44.721
Wait, Taylor, we
should get you asking that.

44:44.754 --> 44:48.291
Good call.

44:48.324 --> 44:50.760
Leslie, I feel as though

44:50.794 --> 44:53.262
you want Kelly to enter the toolshed.

44:53.296 --> 44:55.164
That's correct, Taylor.

44:55.198 --> 44:56.900
It's the first
sign of empowerment

44:56.933 --> 44:58.902
I'll be looking for in her.

44:58.935 --> 45:00.236
At some point she's gonna turn a corner.

45:00.269 --> 45:03.172
It's a pivotal moment
when she makes the transition

45:03.206 --> 45:05.174
from victim to heroine.

45:05.208 --> 45:07.343
This is visually manifested

45:07.376 --> 45:09.112
when she reaches for a big,

45:09.145 --> 45:12.148
long, hard weapon.

45:12.181 --> 45:14.818
You know what I'm talking about.

45:16.686 --> 45:19.689
That's okay, Tay.

45:19.723 --> 45:21.157
It's deeply symbolic.

45:21.190 --> 45:24.160
She's empowering herself

45:24.193 --> 45:27.163
with cock.

45:27.196 --> 45:29.666
Come on.

45:29.699 --> 45:32.902
Look, you go back and
research all of those women

45:32.936 --> 45:35.238
who survived their ordeals
and I guarantee you

45:35.271 --> 45:37.273
none of 'em did it
with a dinky little gun.

45:37.306 --> 45:40.777
So you're saying she'll
reach for something phallic

45:40.810 --> 45:44.614
- on purpose.
- She reaches for my weapon.

45:46.850 --> 45:49.152
That's the ultimate, because she'll be

45:49.185 --> 45:51.921
taking my manhood

45:51.955 --> 45:54.891
and empowering herself with it.

45:54.924 --> 45:57.393
So you're pro-life
and you're a chauvinist.

45:57.426 --> 46:00.730
It's convention, Tay.
You have to respect it.

46:02.098 --> 46:05.735
Let's go to the toolshed.

46:07.203 --> 46:10.206
So let me get this straight...

46:10.239 --> 46:13.710
you want her to arm herself
with one of these?

46:13.743 --> 46:15.712
Well, sort of.

46:15.745 --> 46:18.214
I mean, if you look right here,

46:18.247 --> 46:21.050
I've precut the handle, so it'll snap

46:21.084 --> 46:24.721
with the first swing, and...

46:25.922 --> 46:29.225
I've loosened the head

46:29.258 --> 46:31.160
on the sledgehammer.

46:31.194 --> 46:33.730
I've filed down the
head pin on the pickax.

46:33.763 --> 46:36.900
All the obvious weapons right up front

46:36.933 --> 46:39.769
I've sabotaged.

46:39.803 --> 46:42.739
I just have to hope she doesn't
get lucky with the first swing.

46:43.907 --> 46:45.742
Yeah.

46:46.776 --> 46:50.747
There are 11 exits from the first floor

46:50.780 --> 46:53.817
and another eight or nine
that might be manageable

46:53.850 --> 46:55.184
from the second floor.

46:55.218 --> 46:57.721
You wanna eliminate as many as you can

46:57.754 --> 46:58.755
from being practical,

46:58.788 --> 47:02.125
so I've discreetly

47:02.158 --> 47:03.893
nailed them all shut.

47:03.927 --> 47:06.029
Don't they just smash them out?

47:06.062 --> 47:08.297
You'd think so,

47:08.331 --> 47:10.800
but you'd be surprised.

47:10.834 --> 47:13.803
No. And when they do
smash it out,

47:13.837 --> 47:16.305
it's on the second floor or higher.

47:16.339 --> 47:19.442
And then they're out on the
roof and they're screwed.

47:19.475 --> 47:22.912
I've cut down the larger
branches from the trees

47:22.946 --> 47:25.348
to prevent anyone from climbing down.

47:25.381 --> 47:28.151
And the smaller ones I've precut,

47:28.184 --> 47:29.919
just like at the shed,

47:29.953 --> 47:33.857
so any weight will bring the
whole works crashing down.

47:33.890 --> 47:35.792
Sort of seems like cheating.

47:35.825 --> 47:38.862
It's preparation.

47:40.396 --> 47:41.765
Logistically speaking,

47:41.798 --> 47:44.167
I'm at a severe disadvantage here.

47:45.468 --> 47:47.837
So what's next?

47:47.871 --> 47:50.006
While they regroup,
I have a short window

47:50.039 --> 47:52.508
to prepare for when it all gets outside,

47:52.541 --> 47:55.912
then I work my way back to
the front of the house.

47:55.945 --> 47:58.214
And here's where the
timing becomes critical...

47:58.247 --> 48:01.184
they'll wanna wake up
the two kids upstairs.

48:01.217 --> 48:03.853
And they find them dead and freak out.

48:03.887 --> 48:05.188
Very good.

48:05.221 --> 48:07.857
Go!

48:07.891 --> 48:10.059
Shane, Lauren!

48:10.093 --> 48:11.861
Hurry!

48:11.895 --> 48:14.063
Shoot!

48:27.176 --> 48:30.213
Fucking start. Fucking start, man.

48:35.018 --> 48:36.953
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.

48:36.986 --> 48:38.321
Oh, start!

48:48.231 --> 48:50.433
We're getting
down to the end now.

48:50.466 --> 48:52.335
I think you know where this goes.

48:52.368 --> 48:55.839
- I think so.
- Why don't you...

48:55.872 --> 48:57.874
Why don't you take a shot at it?

48:59.042 --> 49:01.077
Well...

49:02.846 --> 49:05.281
Assuming they all run down here...

49:05.314 --> 49:07.917
Not assuming.
They will run down here.

49:07.951 --> 49:11.220
They'll try to hide and they'll see...

49:13.957 --> 49:17.326
Very good.
What next?

49:17.360 --> 49:20.864
Well, they'll go the
only place left in here.

49:20.897 --> 49:24.100
Yes. No, wait.
Okay, stop.

49:25.301 --> 49:27.403
Aren't you forgetting something?

49:27.436 --> 49:29.939
Oh! Ahab, right?

49:29.973 --> 49:33.242
Exactly. Doc Halloran will
have figured everything out by now,

49:33.276 --> 49:35.411
so I'm expecting him any minute.

49:35.444 --> 49:38.047
All I have to do is keep Kelly busy

49:38.081 --> 49:40.950
by throwing a few bodies here and there.

49:40.984 --> 49:43.486
And then we can have
our whole, you know,

49:43.519 --> 49:47.490
cathartic good-versus-evil showdown.

49:50.894 --> 49:52.896
And then we can move on.

49:58.001 --> 50:00.469
Okay, but she's loose.

50:00.503 --> 50:02.972
So where to now?

50:03.006 --> 50:05.374
The piece De resistance.

50:09.946 --> 50:12.381
If the closet
represents the womb,

50:12.415 --> 50:14.583
- what's this?
- The birth canal.

50:14.617 --> 50:16.552
Well done, Taylor.

50:16.585 --> 50:19.655
Yonic imagery is extremely
important in our work.

50:19.688 --> 50:21.958
Yonic?

50:21.991 --> 50:23.126
Yonic...

50:23.159 --> 50:25.461
opposite of phallic.

50:25.494 --> 50:27.530
It's girl parts.

50:29.365 --> 50:32.268
So she has to go through some
kind of psychological passage

50:32.301 --> 50:34.603
as well as this physical one.

50:37.073 --> 50:40.676
It it works, if she's the
one, she'll emerge...

50:40.709 --> 50:42.511
...her innocence lost,

50:42.545 --> 50:45.148
born again as a woman
hell-bent on revenge.

50:48.952 --> 50:51.887
If she does that...

50:52.989 --> 50:55.591
I'm the happiest man alive.

51:24.620 --> 51:27.290
This is the crown jewel, baby.

51:29.725 --> 51:32.161
- A cider press?
- Yeah.

51:34.163 --> 51:36.565
Need I explain the imagery

51:36.599 --> 51:38.134
of apple crushing?

51:38.167 --> 51:41.670
You needn't.

51:41.704 --> 51:44.173
What's going to happen with this?

51:45.574 --> 51:49.178
Well...

51:49.212 --> 51:51.180
Gonna crush some apples

51:51.214 --> 51:53.516
and then juice is
gonna come pouring out.

51:53.549 --> 51:56.385
All right, Todd, easy.

51:56.419 --> 51:59.088
I meant tonight, funny guy.

51:59.122 --> 52:01.624
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

52:01.657 --> 52:03.659
I was gonna hurt somebody.

52:09.598 --> 52:12.068
- Break some legs tonight, kid.
- I will.

52:12.101 --> 52:13.602
I know you're gonna be great.

52:13.636 --> 52:16.739
Hey, before we go,

52:16.772 --> 52:19.775
how about some advice from the experts?

52:19.808 --> 52:22.678
How does one survive an encounter

52:22.711 --> 52:26.049
with someone like you or Leslie?

52:27.650 --> 52:31.554
I like her, Les.
She's a little spitfire.

52:31.587 --> 52:34.257
- So how about it?
- I'll tell you...

52:34.290 --> 52:37.360
never hang out with a virgin.

52:37.393 --> 52:40.096
You got a virgin in your crew...
either get somebody in her pants

52:40.129 --> 52:43.132
or get the hell away from her.

52:43.166 --> 52:44.233
Aside from that,

52:44.267 --> 52:46.302
the simple answer is...

52:46.335 --> 52:48.037
Run like a motherfucker

52:48.071 --> 52:50.273
and don't stop till the sun comes up.

52:50.306 --> 52:52.741
Pardon the French, but there it is.

52:52.775 --> 52:54.743
And don't try to hide.

52:54.777 --> 52:56.612
We'll find you.

52:56.645 --> 52:59.315
Don't try to be a hero and fight us.

52:59.348 --> 53:01.117
You'll lose.

53:01.150 --> 53:04.820
Pick out a clear spot ahead of
you as far away as possible

53:04.853 --> 53:07.056
and run straight

53:07.090 --> 53:09.325
and don't ever, ever look back,

53:09.358 --> 53:11.627
because you won't like what you see.

53:11.660 --> 53:13.629
I promise you that.

53:13.662 --> 53:17.400
How about sticking together?

53:17.433 --> 53:21.070
Well, sure, sure.
You can do that.

53:21.104 --> 53:24.140
Just make sure there's one poor
son of a bitch slower than you

53:24.173 --> 53:26.275
when it comes time to run.

53:28.277 --> 53:30.146
I was fast, wasn't I, Eugene?

53:30.179 --> 53:32.315
You sure were.

53:32.348 --> 53:35.118
- But you caught me, didn't you?
- I did. I did.

53:38.287 --> 53:40.689
- Okay.
- So nice to meet you.

53:40.723 --> 53:42.691
- All right, all right.
- Take care.

53:42.725 --> 53:46.095
- Take care of yourself.
- Give the old lady a hug.

53:46.129 --> 53:48.497
- Bye.
- Bye, Jamie.

53:48.531 --> 53:50.533
Go get 'em.

53:57.173 --> 53:58.674
This stuff here,

53:58.707 --> 54:01.277
it's sort of a preparation H formula...

54:01.310 --> 54:02.878
what boxers use.

54:02.911 --> 54:05.314
What does it do?

54:05.348 --> 54:08.417
Constricts blood vessels near
the surface of the skin.

54:08.451 --> 54:10.419
Helps stop bleeding from lacerations,

54:10.453 --> 54:12.755
keeps your eyes
from bulging if you get hit.

54:14.223 --> 54:16.359
Plus, it makes you look pale.

54:16.392 --> 54:18.261
Cider man.

54:18.294 --> 54:21.230
And I mixed in my own special
concoction of fire retardants.

54:21.264 --> 54:22.565
It's pretty sweet.

54:24.300 --> 54:27.803
Are you concerned about Doc Halloran?

54:27.836 --> 54:31.207
No. It's not about him.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.343
I need to stay focused.

54:35.911 --> 54:37.880
On Kelly?

54:37.913 --> 54:41.650
My fate, my...

54:41.684 --> 54:44.153
Longevity

54:44.187 --> 54:46.289
depends on what she does.

54:47.590 --> 54:50.593
Yet you're trying to kill her.

54:50.626 --> 54:52.761
That's the paradox of what I do.

54:58.301 --> 55:00.269
You love her, don't you?

55:01.904 --> 55:05.140
I love the idea of her...

55:07.243 --> 55:10.546
Of what I hope
she'll find within herself.

55:11.780 --> 55:15.318
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger?

55:25.694 --> 55:28.331
This is like my Christmas.

55:28.364 --> 55:31.234
If you don't stop and appreciate it,

55:31.267 --> 55:33.602
goes by so quick.

55:43.579 --> 55:45.581
I'm so happy.

55:55.324 --> 55:57.326
I'm so happy.

56:38.334 --> 56:40.669
We got a few hours left.

56:40.703 --> 56:42.771
I'm gonna...

56:44.440 --> 56:46.409
Take one last look around.

57:01.657 --> 57:05.394
Okay, there are eight kids

57:05.428 --> 57:07.029
in the house.

57:07.062 --> 57:09.532
They're downstairs getting juiced

57:09.565 --> 57:11.834
on vodka and beer.

57:11.867 --> 57:14.337
Kelly's here. She's not drinking,

57:14.370 --> 57:17.506
which is good.

57:19.675 --> 57:22.578
Spark plugs... somehow
I just don't feel like

57:22.611 --> 57:25.314
getting run over tonight.
You know what I mean?

57:26.849 --> 57:30.353
Okay, the Jocko kid

57:30.386 --> 57:32.688
and his hot little cheerleader number

57:32.721 --> 57:36.058
should be coming up here any minute.

57:36.091 --> 57:38.894
Um, I usually give 'em

57:38.927 --> 57:40.596
a little bit of time

57:40.629 --> 57:43.666
to get their business going.

57:45.568 --> 57:47.703
It's not a bad way to go out, is it?

57:47.736 --> 57:49.472
- Awesome. Yes.
- Todd!

57:49.505 --> 57:51.407
I'm into her.

58:16.765 --> 58:19.768
All right,

58:19.802 --> 58:23.071
here we go.

58:23.105 --> 58:25.073
Right on time.

58:41.657 --> 58:44.560
Time to dance with the devil.

59:07.750 --> 59:09.752
Todd.

59:11.219 --> 59:12.855
Holy shit.

59:12.888 --> 59:15.458
This is really happening.

59:15.491 --> 59:18.794
Should I be getting
any of this, Taylor?

59:18.827 --> 59:21.497
I don't...
I don't know.

59:26.669 --> 59:30.005
All right.
All right.

59:30.038 --> 59:33.909
All right. All right.

59:33.942 --> 59:36.879
It's begun.
It's begun.

59:38.781 --> 59:41.717
Taylor, hey.

59:41.750 --> 59:43.719
- Taylor, what's wrong?
- No, get that thing out of my face.

59:43.752 --> 59:45.187
Just get it out of my face.

59:45.220 --> 59:47.490
- Where am I supposed to point it?
- I don't give a fuck!

59:47.523 --> 59:49.825
- Hey hey, Jesus Christ!
- Hey, shh.

59:52.561 --> 59:54.797
Okay, outside.
Everybody outside.

59:56.599 --> 59:58.567
Go, go now.

59:58.601 --> 01:00:00.569
Why are you doing this?

01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:03.238
- Because you have a look.
- What look?

01:00:03.271 --> 01:00:07.510
The we-can't-just-stand-here-
and-let-this-happen look.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.782
Doug.

01:00:16.184 --> 01:00:19.154
Now go.
Go. Go.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.663
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:00:27.696 --> 01:00:30.966
It's just I told you this is my night.

01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:33.669
Okay?
And the fact is

01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:35.538
this can still go either way.

01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:39.074
After tonight I'll either be in hiding,

01:00:39.107 --> 01:00:42.678
locked up or dead.

01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:45.648
So the point is...

01:00:47.149 --> 01:00:49.952
We're not gonna see each
other after tonight anyway.

01:00:49.985 --> 01:00:53.589
We might as well
just say our goodbyes now.

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:57.660
So...

01:00:57.693 --> 01:00:59.862
Fellas, it's been a pleasure.

01:01:01.764 --> 01:01:03.566
Thanks.

01:01:07.636 --> 01:01:09.705
Thank you. Best of luck
the rest of the way.

01:01:09.738 --> 01:01:11.874
Yeah, man. You too.

01:01:18.046 --> 01:01:20.315
Les, you...

01:01:20.348 --> 01:01:22.317
you've... you've
chosen to live up

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:25.621
to a fabricated ghost story.

01:01:25.654 --> 01:01:27.623
You've elected to fulfill a destiny

01:01:27.656 --> 01:01:29.191
- you don't have to fulfill.
- No no no. Shh.

01:01:29.224 --> 01:01:31.594
- What?
- Taylor, this has nothing to do

01:01:31.627 --> 01:01:35.530
with where I came from
or what happened to me.

01:01:36.765 --> 01:01:39.768
I would have ended up here
no matter what.

01:01:39.802 --> 01:01:42.170
I made a choice.
I made a choice

01:01:42.204 --> 01:01:46.008
to provide a counterbalance
to all those things

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:49.612
that we hold good and pure.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.982
You chose journalism, okay?

01:02:00.055 --> 01:02:02.057
This is what we are born to do.

01:02:15.337 --> 01:02:17.339
Goodbye, Leslie.

01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:35.724
So that's it? Just like that?

01:02:35.758 --> 01:02:39.027
I can't believe this.

01:02:42.698 --> 01:02:45.100
Pack it up.

01:02:54.142 --> 01:02:56.111
I'm just gonna get
one last shot of the house

01:02:56.144 --> 01:02:57.746
for the closing credits or something.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.683
That's the power, just like he said.

01:03:02.785 --> 01:03:05.888
- He's gotta be in the cellar by now.
- Right on schedule.

01:03:08.256 --> 01:03:10.292
- Taylor, what the fuck?
- I said turn it off.

01:03:10.325 --> 01:03:12.327
We cannot stand here
and let this happen.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.163
Isn't that exactly what he
said you were gonna say?

01:03:17.299 --> 01:03:19.702
God!

01:03:19.735 --> 01:03:21.436
It's over.

01:03:21.469 --> 01:03:24.172
The documentary's done.

01:03:24.206 --> 01:03:27.009
- Now he's done.
- What are you talking about, Tay?

01:03:27.042 --> 01:03:29.444
We know what he's gonna do, okay?

01:03:29.477 --> 01:03:32.147
We know how he's gonna do it.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.082
We can stop him.

01:03:34.116 --> 01:03:36.852
Whoa whoa whoa.
Hang on a second.

01:03:36.885 --> 01:03:39.421
What are you doing?

01:03:39.454 --> 01:03:41.757
He got what he wanted from us, Doug.

01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:44.993
We built up his story for him.

01:03:45.027 --> 01:03:47.029
Now I'm editing it.

01:03:47.062 --> 01:03:49.397
Can we consider this for one second?

01:03:49.431 --> 01:03:51.399
You saw what he's got set up in there.

01:03:51.433 --> 01:03:54.402
You really think that Kelly's
gonna be able to stop him?

01:03:54.436 --> 01:03:57.439
Well, then that would mean she's...

01:03:57.472 --> 01:03:59.975
Mean... oh, she's not
the survivor girl?

01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:02.244
She's fucking 17, Todd.

01:04:02.277 --> 01:04:04.913
We did agree
to do this and not interfere.

01:04:04.947 --> 01:04:06.749
Yeah, well, guess what.

01:04:06.782 --> 01:04:08.917
Okay, look, we go in there,

01:04:08.951 --> 01:04:11.820
we tell Kelly what's happening,
we get the fuck out, okay?

01:04:11.854 --> 01:04:15.023
But what if he comes at us?

01:04:15.057 --> 01:04:18.894
Okay, cool, fine. You guys
stand here holding your balls.

01:04:18.927 --> 01:04:22.798
She had to make the
fucking balls reference.

01:04:23.799 --> 01:04:25.801
Balls.

01:04:29.838 --> 01:04:31.406
This is a bad idea.

01:04:31.439 --> 01:04:34.810
I don't like that I just said
that, given the circumstances.

01:04:38.814 --> 01:04:42.084
- Whoa.
- Hey, fellas.

01:04:43.919 --> 01:04:47.422
- You scared the fuck out of me.
- Where's Kelly?

01:04:47.455 --> 01:04:50.893
Um...

01:04:51.894 --> 01:04:53.862
I think she went upstairs

01:04:53.896 --> 01:04:57.365
with that Shane dude.

01:04:57.399 --> 01:05:01.003
Leslie cannot
know that we are here.

01:05:01.036 --> 01:05:04.206
Can't be in the master bedroom.
They'd have found bodies by now.

01:05:04.239 --> 01:05:06.474
This one wasn't
closed when we left.

01:05:12.447 --> 01:05:14.149
Oh my God.

01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:16.952
Come on, come on, Kelly!

01:05:16.985 --> 01:05:19.855
That's like no
virgin I've ever seen.

01:05:19.888 --> 01:05:22.524
Oh, baby, yeah!

01:05:22.557 --> 01:05:25.060
Who the fuck are you?

01:05:25.093 --> 01:05:26.829
Get the fuck out!

01:05:32.467 --> 01:05:36.304
- She's no virgin.
- That was definitely not her first time, no.

01:05:36.338 --> 01:05:38.907
Leslie's gonna flip his shit, man.

01:05:38.941 --> 01:05:40.242
He's about to kill the jock
in the cellar.

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:42.310
- Kelly, wait wait.
- Who the fuck are you?

01:05:42.344 --> 01:05:44.146
- Why are you following me?
- Shh shh shh.

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:47.482
Kelly, you have to come with us.
There's no time to explain.

01:05:47.515 --> 01:05:49.151
Come on.

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:52.420
It's okay, everybody.

01:05:52.454 --> 01:05:55.590
Everybody, let's go. We're taking
you all out of here right now.

01:05:55.623 --> 01:05:59.194
- Taylor.
- Todd!

01:05:59.227 --> 01:06:03.098
There is a man named
Leslie Mancuso here tonight.

01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:04.867
He's in the cellar right now.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.501
He's planned this entire evening.

01:06:06.534 --> 01:06:08.871
He's gonna stalk and kill
each and every one of you.

01:06:08.904 --> 01:06:12.274
No way, that Leslie Vernon dude?

01:06:12.307 --> 01:06:14.943
No, it's not Leslie Vernon.
It's Leslie man...

01:06:14.977 --> 01:06:17.045
where's Lauren?

01:06:17.079 --> 01:06:19.047
She went down to the cellar

01:06:19.081 --> 01:06:21.049
with that one other dude.

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:23.218
With Pete?

01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:25.020
No no no, you can't go down there.

01:06:25.053 --> 01:06:28.356
- Why not?
- Because...

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:30.926
because it's too late.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.465
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

01:06:37.499 --> 01:06:39.467
Oh my God. There is a man with a mask

01:06:39.501 --> 01:06:42.037
and he killed Pete.
He killed Pete.

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.873
- Oh my God!
- We were just making out and then just came up...

01:06:44.907 --> 01:06:47.042
come on, come on, come on.

01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:52.614
- This isn't happening.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

01:06:52.647 --> 01:06:54.950
but it really is, and it's
about to get a lot worse.

01:07:00.188 --> 01:07:03.058
That night, you remember,
a couple weeks ago,

01:07:03.091 --> 01:07:05.460
you were closing down the coffee shop

01:07:05.493 --> 01:07:08.230
and you took out the trash,
the door slammed shut?

01:07:08.263 --> 01:07:11.566
- You were there?
- You thought you saw a guy standing

01:07:11.599 --> 01:07:14.302
in the shadows watching you, didn't you?

01:07:14.336 --> 01:07:17.072
No. No, I did,
but it wasn't him.

01:07:17.105 --> 01:07:20.242
Yes, it was.
It was him.

01:07:20.275 --> 01:07:22.945
And that night in the library.

01:07:22.978 --> 01:07:24.612
No no.

01:07:24.646 --> 01:07:28.383
You saw him, Kelly. You saw
him, and he's here now.

01:07:28.416 --> 01:07:30.285
Just look at him.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.323
Oh God.
This is not cool, guys.

01:07:35.357 --> 01:07:38.193
- Help me get her in the other room.
- Get her on the couch.

01:07:46.368 --> 01:07:48.103
Well, this isn't working.

01:07:48.136 --> 01:07:50.438
No, it's working perfectly for him.

01:07:50.472 --> 01:07:52.307
We have to mess up his plan somehow.

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.143
The kids...
the kids upstairs.

01:07:55.177 --> 01:07:56.444
They're not supposed to
find them until much later.

01:07:56.478 --> 01:07:58.646
Right, to scare them out of the house.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.950
- We gotta make that happen now.
- Wait, you guys, come here.

01:08:01.984 --> 01:08:04.386
- We gotta show you something.
- Come with us.

01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:11.259
- Sorry to show you this.
- What the fuck?

01:08:13.761 --> 01:08:16.198
No no no, but we saw it, right?

01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:18.033
We're off the plan.

01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:20.702
Let's go find them then.
Dude, come on.

01:08:22.104 --> 01:08:25.107
Kel, relax, okay?
It's just Pete and Mike

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.573
playing a joke on us, all right?

01:08:26.608 --> 01:08:29.044
Julie's probably in
on it too, all right?

01:08:29.077 --> 01:08:31.179
I'll call him right now.

01:08:36.584 --> 01:08:39.554
There's no service.

01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:43.225
Why would he change the plan like this?

01:08:43.258 --> 01:08:45.227
He's adjusting it.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.130
- Why? What for?
- To accommodate for the extra people

01:08:48.162 --> 01:08:49.531
in the hou...

01:08:49.564 --> 01:08:52.399
tell me he didn't see you
before at the window.

01:08:54.702 --> 01:08:57.104
- Fuck me!
- God!

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.742
Let's just think this thing through.

01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:03.711
He's got these two clowns going
to look in the toolshed.

01:09:03.745 --> 01:09:06.214
He's only expecting one kid.

01:09:06.247 --> 01:09:09.084
Oh, God, he's gonna
kill them both there.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:19.027
Fuck it, dude.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.595
Cover me.
I'm going in.

01:09:23.798 --> 01:09:26.600
Cover you with what, dude?

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:40.381
Holy shit.

01:09:40.415 --> 01:09:43.417
Dude, check out this scarecrow, man.

01:09:43.451 --> 01:09:45.252
Just come on back out here, man.

01:09:45.287 --> 01:09:47.455
I wanna put this in my room.

01:09:55.297 --> 01:09:57.199
Come on, man.
Let's go.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.083
No!

01:10:36.304 --> 01:10:38.406
- We are so fucked!
- Back to Kelly.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.275
Come on.

01:10:40.308 --> 01:10:44.246
Our fucking tires are
slashed on all our cars.

01:10:44.279 --> 01:10:46.181
He's making it all happen

01:10:46.214 --> 01:10:48.850
exactly as planned, despite the changes.

01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:50.785
He's really good.

01:10:50.818 --> 01:10:53.555
In a really bad way I mean,
but he's really good.

01:10:53.588 --> 01:10:56.258
I'm a little more freaked about her.
What kind of a survivor girl

01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:58.560
- passes out in a pinch?
- Passes out?

01:10:58.593 --> 01:11:01.563
What kind of survivor girl hops
on the nerdy kid's Johnson

01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:03.165
like it's a pogo stick?

01:11:03.198 --> 01:11:05.567
Okay, all right, look. The
solution's in the plan.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.869
That's how we're gonna beat him.
What comes next?

01:11:07.902 --> 01:11:10.772
I didn't wanna
come back to the house.

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.907
You're the one who wanted
to go back to the house.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.378
Dude, it's not her fault.
We're all in this together.

01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:18.180
What, like she doesn't know?

01:11:18.213 --> 01:11:21.183
- 95% of all whores know that they're whores.
- You made that up.

01:11:21.216 --> 01:11:23.685
Come on, help me out here.
What's next? Come on.

01:11:23.718 --> 01:11:27.322
The kids, they go upstairs
and find the dead bodies

01:11:27.355 --> 01:11:30.692
- and then they head out to their cars.
- Which are sabotaged.

01:11:30.725 --> 01:11:32.927
Yeah, but our van isn't.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.463
- Hey, guys, let's go.
- Come here, hey hey.

01:11:36.864 --> 01:11:38.866
Come with us.

01:11:44.639 --> 01:11:48.243
Holy fuck! Fuck!

01:11:48.276 --> 01:11:49.811
Quiet! Shh!

01:12:00.322 --> 01:12:02.257
Todd, it's not gonna start.

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:04.526
God damn it!

01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:06.228
He's way ahead of us.

01:12:06.261 --> 01:12:08.730
Back to the house.
He didn't plan on that.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.537
- What now?
- Okay, he said he hated being inside,

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:19.341
so we stay in a group.
We protect Kelly.

01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:20.575
We wait him out.

01:12:20.608 --> 01:12:24.246
Protect me?
Why not protect all of us?

01:12:24.279 --> 01:12:27.315
Kelly, you gotta dig deep,
I mean, real deep.

01:12:27.349 --> 01:12:30.585
We're all counting on you
from here on out.

01:12:30.618 --> 01:12:32.287
Me? Why me?

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.322
Because he thinks
you're his survivor girl.

01:12:34.356 --> 01:12:35.990
His what?

01:12:36.023 --> 01:12:37.692
A survivor girl.

01:12:37.725 --> 01:12:40.428
He think you're the one

01:12:40.462 --> 01:12:42.597
who's going to fight him and beat him.

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:45.333
Well, why the hell would he think that?

01:12:45.367 --> 01:12:48.536
Because he's been studying
you, all of you, for months.

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:51.239
He thinks you're showing the signs.

01:12:51.273 --> 01:12:52.774
He thinks you're a virgin...

01:12:52.807 --> 01:12:55.343
- Ha!
- Fuck you, bitch.

01:12:55.377 --> 01:12:58.313
- Yeah, you would.
- Wowie wow.

01:12:58.346 --> 01:13:00.448
...which you clearly are not

01:13:00.482 --> 01:13:04.319
and if Leslie's figured that out...

01:13:04.352 --> 01:13:07.955
What? What?
He'll do what?

01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:11.326
He'll kill all of us
and leave no witnesses.

01:13:11.359 --> 01:13:14.496
Oh, great.
Way to go, kel.

01:13:14.529 --> 01:13:16.598
This is my fault?

01:13:16.631 --> 01:13:19.267
Because I'm sexually active?

01:13:20.968 --> 01:13:24.372
I am sorry I'm not a virgin!

01:13:32.414 --> 01:13:33.681
- Kelly, no!
- No no!

01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:42.757
Cat's out of the bag now.

01:13:51.866 --> 01:13:54.802
Taylor, they're headed for the barn,
exactly where he wants them to go.

01:13:54.836 --> 01:13:56.804
- Fuck this.
- Todd, what are you doing?

01:13:56.838 --> 01:13:59.574
Don't you get it?
We're in this now.

01:13:59.607 --> 01:14:01.543
We're part of his equation.

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.413
I'll see you around.
Have a nice summer.

01:14:05.447 --> 01:14:08.550
Leslie, no one gets away...
rule number one.

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:10.352
- Selfish...
- no no no, wait.

01:14:10.385 --> 01:14:12.387
Les, I'm doing it!

01:14:14.088 --> 01:14:16.891
- He's gonna lead him.
- Doug, let's go. Run!

01:14:16.924 --> 01:14:18.526
Come on, Les.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.994
Come on, buddy.

01:14:20.027 --> 01:14:22.397
Come on, you physical specimen.

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.366
Chase the Doughboy.

01:14:24.399 --> 01:14:25.700
You gotta chase me.

01:14:25.733 --> 01:14:29.404
Your rules, not mine, baby.

01:14:29.437 --> 01:14:32.407
I'm getting tired.

01:14:38.513 --> 01:14:40.382
What the fuck?

01:14:43.418 --> 01:14:45.820
Come on, Les.
Come on, Les man.

01:14:45.853 --> 01:14:48.523
Look at me.
Look at me, Les.

01:14:48.556 --> 01:14:52.494
Look at me. Let me see you.
Let me see you.

01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:55.530
Look at me, man.

01:14:55.563 --> 01:14:59.467
It's fucking Todd. It's Todd.

01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:01.035
In it together...

01:15:01.068 --> 01:15:03.571
we're fucking doing
this thing together, man.

01:15:03.605 --> 01:15:06.374
It's Todd.

01:15:06.408 --> 01:15:08.443
Come on, come on.

01:15:08.476 --> 01:15:10.545
Come on!

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.750
God! Wait!

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:26.761
Lauren, no! Don't go up there!

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.137
Maybe it worked.
Maybe Todd got away.

01:15:37.505 --> 01:15:38.840
We should go check.

01:15:38.873 --> 01:15:42.410
Maybe his plan's all fubar
now and he bailed out.

01:15:42.444 --> 01:15:44.145
We're right where he wants us,

01:15:44.178 --> 01:15:45.813
all of us.

01:15:45.847 --> 01:15:47.815
Well, you got us into this, Taylor.

01:15:47.849 --> 01:15:50.918
We could have just gotten
in the van and driven away.

01:15:50.952 --> 01:15:53.821
You were just gonna leave us here?

01:15:56.023 --> 01:15:58.125
How long have you been following us?

01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:07.034
It doesn't matter.

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:11.573
- You don't matter.
- Why are you saying that?

01:16:12.874 --> 01:16:15.477
He knew.

01:16:16.744 --> 01:16:19.080
He knew before...

01:16:19.113 --> 01:16:21.616
We started, before...

01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:23.485
before we even met.

01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:27.088
That's why he agreed to do this.

01:16:27.121 --> 01:16:29.524
He...

01:16:29.557 --> 01:16:32.494
he found me before we ever shot a frame.

01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:36.531
Taylor, you're not making any sense.

01:16:36.564 --> 01:16:38.700
It's perfect.
Oh my God.

01:16:38.733 --> 01:16:40.868
It's genius.

01:16:40.902 --> 01:16:44.071
Taylor, knock it off. His
plan, his plan, it's fucked.

01:16:44.105 --> 01:16:45.840
Okay, he's got no virgin,

01:16:45.873 --> 01:16:48.676
and Todd made him run
in the wrong direction.

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.178
Now think.

01:16:53.014 --> 01:16:55.016
It's her.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.189
- Get up.
- Lauren's right.

01:17:02.223 --> 01:17:03.691
It's you.

01:17:03.725 --> 01:17:07.161
You're the Vrgin.

01:17:07.194 --> 01:17:09.864
This whole time it was you.

01:17:13.735 --> 01:17:16.671
Please please,

01:17:16.704 --> 01:17:18.706
you have to tell me...

01:17:20.808 --> 01:17:23.210
What happens to me?

01:17:24.579 --> 01:17:27.014
Oh my God!

01:17:27.048 --> 01:17:28.550
- Lauren.
- Oh my God!

01:17:56.343 --> 01:17:58.880
Doug, don't.

01:18:12.026 --> 01:18:14.061
Lauren, no!

01:18:28.275 --> 01:18:31.545
Get off me.
Get the fuck off me!

01:18:46.293 --> 01:18:48.295
Come on, we gotta go.

01:18:50.732 --> 01:18:53.567
- Oh, shit, the hole's blocked.
- He's thought of this already.

01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:57.972
We gotta find another way. Doug.

01:18:58.005 --> 01:19:00.675
- Doug, it's no good.
- Help me then. Quit explaining.

01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:02.744
He's planned for...

01:19:02.777 --> 01:19:05.012
Oh my God.

01:19:05.046 --> 01:19:07.749
- ...that.
- Leslie!

01:19:07.782 --> 01:19:09.150
Hi, doc.

01:19:14.789 --> 01:19:17.324
No, boy.
