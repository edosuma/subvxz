01:21.473 --> 01:22.471
What was the question?

01:29.688 --> 01:30.648
Um..

01:34.860 --> 01:36.195
I mean, what's happy?

01:37.988 --> 01:39.906
Really, I mean, it's..

01:39.908 --> 01:41.031
...so arbitrary.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.284
I... I'm... I'm..

01:43.286 --> 01:44.494
Look, we had a fight

01:44.496 --> 01:46.455
so I'm not, like,
"Oh..

01:47.539 --> 01:48.833
...I'm happy."

01:49.625 --> 01:51.002
But I'm happy.

01:52.586 --> 01:53.880
I like Rebecca.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.549
She feels like family.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.890
Sometimes I feel like
she validates

02:05.892 --> 02:07.685
how I feel
about the world.

02:08.727 --> 02:10.560
I think she's smart

02:10.562 --> 02:12.941
and that makes me
feel smart.

02:14.233 --> 02:15.192
But..

02:17.194 --> 02:19.489
...sometimes it feels..

02:22.658 --> 02:25.827
...it's all too clean.

02:25.829 --> 02:27.122
You know?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.751
But I'm happy.

02:40.175 --> 02:41.093
Are you?

02:48.768 --> 02:50.103
Sometimes I'm happy.

02:50.978 --> 02:53.061
Can't always be happy.

02:53.063 --> 02:53.982
That's true.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.780
What makes you happy?

03:04.158 --> 03:06.701
I just love my kids,
you know.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.785
I do.

03:08.787 --> 03:12.290
Seeing you,
I wanna see you..

03:12.292 --> 03:14.878
...you know, I wanna see
you happy and fulfilled.

03:17.589 --> 03:21.175
Just love my boys.
What can I say?

03:25.972 --> 03:27.888
And your dad's
pretty good in bed too.

03:47.869 --> 03:50.410
I need you to teach me this.

03:50.412 --> 03:51.411
Nah. I've got a blanket
for you.

03:51.413 --> 03:52.706
I could do that part.

03:54.626 --> 03:55.710
There we go.

03:59.297 --> 04:00.381
Alright, thank you.

04:06.971 --> 04:10.473
Guys, this is Paul,
he's an old friend.

04:10.475 --> 04:11.641
This is Alex, and Graham.

04:11.643 --> 04:13.850
- Really old.
- I'm sorry.

04:13.852 --> 04:15.727
- This is John.
- Hey, welcome, my friend.

04:25.907 --> 04:27.157
No, check that out.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.751
Hey.

04:39.753 --> 04:41.295
You hiding out?

04:41.297 --> 04:43.088
I thought I had an hour.

04:43.090 --> 04:44.383
You had it.

05:12.537 --> 05:13.455
John.

05:14.621 --> 05:16.290
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

05:21.128 --> 05:22.335
Hi. Emilie.

05:24.506 --> 05:26.131
Thank you so much.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.349
- You mad at me?
- No.

05:38.395 --> 05:39.520
Are you mad at me?

05:39.522 --> 05:41.441
- I just wanna finish this.
- Okay.

05:47.071 --> 05:48.571
Are you mad at me?

05:48.573 --> 05:50.616
Oh, my God,
you're intolerable.

06:02.253 --> 06:04.127
I love you, old man.

06:04.129 --> 06:07.256
Uh, I love you more than
all the other old men.

06:07.258 --> 06:08.840
Can I ask you something?

06:08.842 --> 06:11.968
Does he, um, does he do soliloquies
when he's going down on you?

06:11.970 --> 06:13.554
What are you asking?

06:13.556 --> 06:14.638
She's fucking
what's-his-face

06:14.640 --> 06:16.059
the Duke of Athens
over here.

06:17.099 --> 06:18.309
- I did not say that! He's a freshman.
- And?

06:18.311 --> 06:22.146
- I don't tolerate freshmen.
- Since when?

06:22.148 --> 06:25.732
- You want wine?
- Glenn, Glenn, when do you start?

06:25.734 --> 06:27.610
- Sorry?
- When do you actually start?

06:27.612 --> 06:29.319
Immediately. I'll be
up there on Monday.

06:29.321 --> 06:30.696
- Wow.
- Wow.

06:30.698 --> 06:33.073
- Will you commute?
- If my wife has her way.

06:33.075 --> 06:35.033
Glenn's afraid
that his marriage is over.

06:35.035 --> 06:38.078
- I'm not laughing.
- Uh, I'm taking this.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.872
- See, this is his thing.
- Yes!

06:39.874 --> 06:41.374
What's my thing?

06:41.376 --> 06:44.626
Before you do something selfish,
you, like, broadcast it.

06:44.628 --> 06:46.172
You think
it makes it okay.

06:48.549 --> 06:51.174
We're in love, so we're
allowed to say mean things

06:51.176 --> 06:52.175
to each other, I guess.

06:52.177 --> 06:53.343
You're showing me tits.

06:53.345 --> 06:55.138
There're these pictures
I made.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.598
- You've got tits?
- Look.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.893
It's fine.

07:01.729 --> 07:03.646
- You know, it's getting dark.
- Okay.

07:03.648 --> 07:05.148
Should probably
get 'em home.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.900
When are you going
to grow up?

07:08.152 --> 07:09.362
Did you have any?

07:11.739 --> 07:12.864
Have it, it's good.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.158
Quit now, James.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.367
So now he's affectionate.

07:21.039 --> 07:22.874
She'd run
the other designer off.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.417
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

07:24.419 --> 07:26.335
Glenn, it's not true.
She took another job.

07:26.337 --> 07:27.335
She went to,
I don't know where.

07:27.337 --> 07:29.004
UT, I think.
She resigned.

07:29.006 --> 07:31.883
Yeah, she resigned. Her
assistant was fucking her boss

07:31.885 --> 07:33.134
What else
is she gonna do?

07:33.136 --> 07:34.218
- No, it's not.
- So, what, it's true?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.595
- Oh, my God. Chris.
- It's true.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.013
No, no, it's not.
I went out with him once.

07:38.015 --> 07:39.598
One time.
I was an idiot.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.018
I thought that, you know
he was being professional.

07:42.020 --> 07:45.228
When she came along, I couldn't
sign the papers fast enough.

07:45.230 --> 07:46.773
- Oh, how romantic.
- You..

07:46.775 --> 07:48.398
You would've been
on marriage, what?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.066
Your marriage number two?

07:50.068 --> 07:52.737
Wait, wasn't that
your, uh, open marriage?

07:52.739 --> 07:54.489
Yeah, she was a swinger!

07:54.491 --> 07:57.574
- No, I wasn't!
- That's what she said. Is that not what she said?

07:57.576 --> 08:00.119
Being in an open marriage is not
the same thing as being a swinger.

08:00.121 --> 08:01.746
Close enough!

08:01.748 --> 08:02.749
Three marriages.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.924
- Pear?
- I don't like pears.

08:13.926 --> 08:17.052
No, these are,
um, poached pears.

08:17.054 --> 08:18.929
They're not normal.

08:18.931 --> 08:19.848
Great.

08:21.266 --> 08:24.436
- Do you know what poached pears are?
- Yes.

08:25.313 --> 08:26.272
Try one.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.441
- What?
- Nothing. Go ahead.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.363
- I, I'm just offering them pears.
- I see that.

08:35.447 --> 08:38.158
"All days are nights
to see..

08:39.119 --> 08:41.243
"...till I see thee.

08:41.245 --> 08:46.165
"And nights bright days when
dreams do show thee me.

08:46.167 --> 08:50.627
"When most I wink, then
do mine eyes best see..

08:50.629 --> 08:53.046
"...for all the day..

08:53.048 --> 08:55.968
...they view things
unrespected."

09:00.556 --> 09:01.722
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:01.724 --> 09:02.973
- Beautiful, Glenn.
- Cheers.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.268
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:06.271 --> 09:07.437
One more time, dad.

09:09.190 --> 09:10.272
Leave him alone.

09:32.754 --> 09:34.047
Stop it.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.341
I'll bust your butt.

09:37.634 --> 09:39.176
- Come on, then.
- Don't think I won't.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.679
- Okay.
- That sounds terrible, Glenn.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.389
Yeah, he fell asleep
in the bath.

09:43.391 --> 09:44.848
I don't feel anything.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.476
- I just can't talk.
- Is that true?

09:46.478 --> 09:48.394
Let's go.

09:48.396 --> 09:51.021
- That's the only way he can get any rest.
- Stop it.

10:15.465 --> 10:17.716
Hey. Thanks.

10:21.513 --> 10:24.012
- Hi.
- I've been circling for half an hour.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.058
I didn't see you.

10:27.099 --> 10:27.391
I tried calling.
You didn't pick up.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.561
I, I don't have my phone.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.024
Well, you could've
just parked and come in.

10:35.026 --> 10:37.402
Well, you said you were
gonna wait outside.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.075
It's good to see you too.

10:53.503 --> 10:54.919
- Okay.
- Lift him up.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.337
Alright, there you go.
There you go.

10:56.339 --> 10:58.673
- That's it, dad.
- Okay.

11:03.763 --> 11:04.681
One, two, three.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.265
Ah!

11:14.023 --> 11:16.022
Glenn, this is so
you can breathe easier.

11:16.024 --> 11:18.694
I want you to try and
breathe through your nose.

11:21.572 --> 11:22.781
Okay, hold on.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.701
Here you go.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.793
It's okay, it's okay. This
is gonna help you breathe.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.005
It's alright.

11:39.382 --> 11:41.133
- I'll get them.
- Okay, sweetie.

11:43.845 --> 11:45.969
Here we go.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.722
If you can lift
after this. Just wait.

11:47.724 --> 11:50.059
- One second.
- Alright. Hold on.

11:51.099 --> 11:51.311
Okay, now.

11:52.729 --> 11:53.646
Watch his head.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.356
Okay, back.

11:57.358 --> 11:59.775
Really gentle.
There we go.

11:59.777 --> 12:01.276
Good job, honey.

12:01.278 --> 12:05.072
- It's almost done.
- There you go.

12:05.074 --> 12:06.156
We're not gonna..
There you go.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.324
It's okay, sweetheart.

12:51.870 --> 12:54.372
Do you want me to get you
up or do you wanna sleep?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.834
Mm..

12:59.838 --> 13:01.753
You asked me
to get you up.

13:01.755 --> 13:03.507
Just five more minutes.

13:14.518 --> 13:16.144
I came here
to support you

13:16.146 --> 13:18.731
but it feels like
you don't want me around.

13:32.829 --> 13:35.579
- You can't answer me?
- I'm, I'm sleeping.

13:38.334 --> 13:40.170
Okay, we've got him here.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.631
Okay, just give me
a second, please.

13:45.633 --> 13:46.756
- Alright.
- Okay.

13:46.758 --> 13:49.385
Back him up just a bit.
Please, just a bit.

13:49.387 --> 13:50.761
Just a bit.
There you go.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.762
- Are you alright? Is that good?
- Yeah.

13:52.764 --> 13:55.183
There we are. Okay.

13:55.185 --> 13:57.101
- Alright.
- Okay, you can sit him down.

13:59.314 --> 14:01.021
- There.
- We shouldn't be in here.

14:01.023 --> 14:03.232
- It's okay.
- He's embarrassed.

14:03.234 --> 14:04.527
He's just sitting there.

14:05.861 --> 14:08.112
It's humiliating.
Let's just wait. Just...

14:08.114 --> 14:10.450
- Suzanne?
- Oh, thank you.

14:11.575 --> 14:13.494
- Wait, he's falling.
- Hang on.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.204
There we are. It's okay.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.080
There we go.

14:19.082 --> 14:21.001
Hold on. There you go.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.961
Alright.

14:23.963 --> 14:24.881
Here we are.

14:33.889 --> 14:35.808
I think that's it, okay?

14:40.939 --> 14:43.608
- Alright. You ready?
- Come back up.

15:19.310 --> 15:21.352
...a ride around
the back roads.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.354
We always had stuff. They
had an ice cream place.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.942
They hadn't had that
before they'd come home.

15:29.278 --> 15:33.280
They liked to talk with
us, and we'd walk.

15:33.282 --> 15:36.199
When you'd go away
and let them go away

15:36.201 --> 15:38.160
and have a good time.

15:49.923 --> 15:51.799
- Oh, wait, wait.
- What?

15:51.801 --> 15:54.176
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
cum if we keep going.

15:54.178 --> 15:57.137
Cum. Cum. I want you to.

15:57.139 --> 15:58.555
You don't wanna finish?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.649
Oh! Oh!

16:18.119 --> 16:21.080
Oh. Oh. Oh.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.353
Hmm..

16:56.282 --> 16:57.575
- Good?
- Yeah.

17:04.748 --> 17:07.125
- ...fucking bed like an animal!
- Just stop, stop for a...

17:07.127 --> 17:08.541
- What happened?
- Just, it's.. Wait.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.167
- What happened?
- She restrained him.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.546
What are you smiling at?

17:11.548 --> 17:13.003
- Just.. Chris, that's enough.
- Chris. Stop that.

17:13.006 --> 17:15.633
- I was only trying to make him comfortable.
- I'm...

17:15.635 --> 17:16.715
- I'm not an idiot!
- Chris!

17:16.718 --> 17:17.717
- Enough!
- I'm not making it up!

17:17.719 --> 17:19.137
- Enough!
- Please!

17:21.390 --> 17:22.932
- I'm sorry.
- No.

17:22.934 --> 17:24.767
- I'm sorry. Okay?
- No, that's okay.

17:24.769 --> 17:27.478
You know, you can go, I mean,
I, I really appreciate it and..

17:27.480 --> 17:29.856
...thank you so much for
everything, and, uh, you know

17:29.858 --> 17:31.816
I'll ta... I'll talk
to him. I'll talk to him.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.768
How's the wine?

18:06.770 --> 18:08.144
Anybody want
a little more?

18:08.146 --> 18:10.437
- That white's really good.
- The white is good.

18:10.439 --> 18:12.191
- Isn't that good?
- The red's good too.

18:13.025 --> 18:13.942
Hey, do you want some?

18:20.574 --> 18:22.534
You're inconsolable.

18:23.328 --> 18:24.244
Huh?

18:27.080 --> 18:30.707
- Like an infant.
- Can we not say mean things?

18:30.709 --> 18:33.543
Inconsolable
little infant.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.715
I'm not doing this, Nick.

18:41.262 --> 18:44.387
- You're inconsolable.
- Can you stop?

18:44.389 --> 18:47.767
You have determined
that you're being ignored

18:47.769 --> 18:50.060
so you behave like this,
like an infant?

18:50.062 --> 18:52.732
And so I ignore you.
What am I supposed to do?

18:59.947 --> 19:02.157
- I think we should go to bed.
- No!

19:08.164 --> 19:11.709
You are not the center of
anyone's attention right now.

19:14.712 --> 19:16.381
And you shouldn't be.

19:19.384 --> 19:21.301
Full fucking stop,
Rebecca.

20:32.372 --> 20:33.539
Ma.

20:33.541 --> 20:35.791
- Hey.
- Hey, we're gonna, um..

20:35.793 --> 20:37.542
Sorry.

20:37.544 --> 20:39.878
- You're off?
- Yeah.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.297
I'm sorry
I can't stay longer.

20:41.299 --> 20:43.551
Oh, stop.
We'll see you soon.

20:46.721 --> 20:48.013
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.108
Wait.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.759
You'll wanna pick out
some clothing

22:08.761 --> 22:11.095
that Glenn would be
comfortable in wearing.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.097
He may have been
very involved

22:13.099 --> 22:15.849
and already picked out his
clothing, I don't know.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.976
Yes, he was
very involved.

22:17.978 --> 22:21.563
And then lastly, we'll
follow up in a day or two

22:21.565 --> 22:23.941
and see how you're coping
and how you're doing.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.777
- Um..
- Well, thank you.

22:25.779 --> 22:29.532
And if there's any questions,
you know, feel free to ask me.

22:30.617 --> 22:31.993
I don't think so.

25:42.391 --> 25:43.890
- Hi, hi.
- Hello.

25:43.892 --> 25:45.559
Hello. Hi, I'm Suzanne.

25:45.561 --> 25:47.395
- I'm Lauren. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

25:47.397 --> 25:50.647
- Can I take your stuff?
- Oh, thank you.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.317
I'm okay.
Thank you so much.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.027
- Hi, I'm Chris.
- Lauren.

25:55.029 --> 25:57.405
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:57.407 --> 25:58.947
Thanks.

25:58.949 --> 26:01.283
- Hey, what's your name?
- Tia.

26:01.285 --> 26:04.619
- Well, hello.
- Come on. Come on in, come on in.

26:04.621 --> 26:09.125
- Hey. You got here.
- Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

26:09.127 --> 26:11.085
- You look great.
- You look beautiful.

26:11.087 --> 26:14.797
- Welcome. Hi.
- Oh, hello. Hi.

26:14.799 --> 26:16.674
- Oh, hi.
- Can I introduce you..

26:16.676 --> 26:19.760
- Hey, it's me, your brother.
- I know who you are.

26:19.762 --> 26:23.181
Uh, mom, this is,
uh, Greg and Margo.

26:23.183 --> 26:25.558
- Oh, hello. So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.185
- Suzanne.
- Yeah, it was a pleasure.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.480
That's me. Emilie.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.732
- This is for...
- Oh, I got you these. Oh, sorry.

26:33.734 --> 26:36.234
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Oh, thank you. So nice.

26:36.236 --> 26:38.029
- Hello there.
- Come on in, we'll have some drinks.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.323
Oh, thank you.

26:44.661 --> 26:45.828
Excuse me.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.746
Could I interrupt
your conversations

26:47.748 --> 26:48.955
for just a moment?

26:48.957 --> 26:51.416
Uh, it might be
timely for me

26:51.418 --> 26:54.169
to propose a toast.

26:54.171 --> 26:57.423
Uh, we're gathered here not
just to celebrate the holidays

26:57.425 --> 26:59.383
but to celebrate
the engagement

26:59.385 --> 27:03.721
of my darling youngest
daughter Emilie and Nick.

27:03.723 --> 27:07.474
And it fills Margo and I both
with a great deal of joy

27:07.476 --> 27:11.896
to have Nick and his family,
Suzanne and Chris here

27:11.898 --> 27:13.815
along with our friends.

27:13.817 --> 27:18.194
Let's raise
our glasses to... marriage

27:18.196 --> 27:20.738
long-lived and fruitful.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.739
Hear, hear.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.281
And to my mother.

27:23.283 --> 27:25.909
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.078
- Cheers, mom.
- Cheers.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.375
- My pleasure, Nick.
- Thanks, dad.

27:34.587 --> 27:36.253
We moved one step ahead.

27:39.926 --> 27:42.095
- What.. Oh, shit.
- Whoa!

27:43.721 --> 27:45.596
Nice one.

27:45.598 --> 27:48.059
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:49.099 --> 27:49.434
- It happens.
- It happens.

27:49.436 --> 27:51.144
And what about you,
what do you do?

27:51.146 --> 27:54.271
I work at the college with Suzanne
in the, in the theatre department.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.315
Oh, interesting.

27:56.317 --> 27:58.443
I... I really work
in th... this marketing

27:58.445 --> 28:00.153
for the plays
that they do.

28:00.155 --> 28:02.655
Also a little bit
of consulting for the kids

28:02.657 --> 28:07.827
when they're getting ready to go
out into the, the real world.

28:07.829 --> 28:09.953
- Uh-huh.
- I used to be an actress myself.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.999
- And Chris, what do you do? What kind of work?
- Oh. Me?

28:13.001 --> 28:14.416
I'm, uh..

28:14.418 --> 28:18.628
I write whatever I want that
no one will want to read.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.174
- Like novels or..
- Hmm, uh, yeah.

28:21.176 --> 28:22.760
But, very, very short.

28:24.637 --> 28:28.263
Oh, come on, dad. You were
such a hippie back in the day.

28:28.265 --> 28:32.309
It's the shop, it's
like coming up off Craigslist.

28:32.311 --> 28:37.607
We didn't celebrate our weddings
by getting goofy on mushrooms.

28:37.609 --> 28:38.732
It's you.

28:38.734 --> 28:40.859
- No. Really?
- People do this.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.820
I shouldn't be laughing.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.615
- I think it's a good..
- Sorry.

28:45.617 --> 28:46.991
...bonding experience

28:46.993 --> 28:48.784
and to bring the family
together, I don't know.

28:48.786 --> 28:50.494
I don't think
it's funny.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.204
- No, I think it's.. Okay. I get..
- I'm excited.

28:52.206 --> 28:53.998
- You were excited.
- I am excited.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.334
- Okay.
- I get that it's, it's unusual.

28:56.336 --> 28:58.168
But, that's okay.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.338
We're okay with people..

29:00.340 --> 29:02.130
...being confused by it.

29:02.132 --> 29:03.174
I mean, I think the..

29:07.138 --> 29:08.721
What are these?

29:08.723 --> 29:11.348
These are Italian
wedding cookies.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.561
- Well, can I have one?
- Yeah.

29:15.813 --> 29:16.855

29:19.192 --> 29:20.774

- Like, all the time?

29:20.776 --> 29:24.363
Uh, we work for the catering
company, if that's what you mean.

You're good.

32:20.998 --> 32:23.331
- You wanna sit down?
- I don't wanna sit down.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.876
That's a bad idea.

32:25.878 --> 32:29.213
- You wanna lie down?
- I wanna... pee.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.840
I just wanna pee
and then it's fine.

32:31.842 --> 32:33.550

Chris!

Stop it.
Jesus! Are you..

33:10.380 --> 33:11.798
- Get outta here!
- Damn it!

33:11.800 --> 33:13.299
What are you doing?

33:13.301 --> 33:14.424
- Oh, shit.
- Mom!

33:14.426 --> 33:15.926
Okay, I'm going!

33:15.928 --> 33:18.637
- I am sorry to you.
- Sit down.

33:18.639 --> 33:20.306
- I'm so sorry.
- Whoa!

33:20.308 --> 33:21.307
I... I'm...

33:21.309 --> 33:22.433
Uh, it was like

33:22.435 --> 33:24.059
a dog food commercial.

33:24.061 --> 33:25.228
Oh, no.

33:25.230 --> 33:26.771
It was
a dog food commercial

33:26.773 --> 33:28.271
and, um, I was a..

33:28.273 --> 33:30.607
- Wet or dry?
- Um..

33:30.609 --> 33:32.484
Didn't get that far. That
was in the callback.

33:32.486 --> 33:35.613
- You didn't get that far?
- Yeah, they had, like, plastic dog food.

33:35.615 --> 33:36.905
And I was, like,
a dog owner

33:36.907 --> 33:38.616
and I was supposed
to be with my dog, like

33:38.618 --> 33:40.451
"You like it? I like it."

33:40.453 --> 33:42.744
And, um, it was
so humiliating, right?

33:42.746 --> 33:44.621
'Cause it was, like,
plastic dog food.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.290
- Yeah.
- Was there a real dog?

33:46.292 --> 33:49.710
No. It was a fucking
shaggy puppet dog.

33:49.712 --> 33:53.463
And I went.. I slumped over visibly.
I was just like..

33:54.967 --> 33:56.800
And he put his hand on my
shoulder and he was like

33:56.802 --> 33:58.469
"I know, man. I know."

33:58.471 --> 34:00.262
- Oh, man, Chris.
- And then, that's it. That was..

34:00.264 --> 34:02.223
Were you supposed to make a
face, like, you didn't like it?

34:02.225 --> 34:04.099
- Or you liked it?
- No, you were supposed to like it.

34:04.101 --> 34:06.726
It was, like, "Can you give me one where
you just really love this stuff?"

34:06.728 --> 34:08.395
I don't understand
this commercial.

34:08.397 --> 34:09.813
- Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
- The commercial is...

34:09.815 --> 34:12.150
Yeah, it's their fault.
They're a bunch of idiots.

34:12.152 --> 34:13.942
I came in
as a true artist.

34:13.944 --> 34:17.822
It sounds like it's actually a
snack for dogs and, and humans.

34:17.824 --> 34:21.159
I read the proposal, but for the
benefit of my colleagues here

34:21.161 --> 34:26.121
can you explain, um, how you
see it as a hybrid of memoir

34:26.123 --> 34:29.166
and, and history
of Shepard Stuyvesant?

34:29.168 --> 34:33.337
Uh, well, it intersperses chapters
that are taken from my own life.

34:33.339 --> 34:38.800
Yet I think, there's also a historical
and critical element that, um..

34:38.802 --> 34:43.306
...that really, I think, kinda
marries itself to the memoir section

34:43.308 --> 34:47.353
in a way that's unique and I
think will speak to readers.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.855
Do you think
it will upset..

34:56.029 --> 34:58.654
- They're all their life?
- I think so.

34:58.656 --> 35:01.199
And I think that I'm trying
to speak to that line.

35:01.201 --> 35:02.407
You're.. Are you
straddling that line?

35:02.409 --> 35:03.659
I think I'm on the line.

35:03.661 --> 35:05.119
- You're on the line?
- I am the line.

35:05.121 --> 35:06.871
You are the line. Okay.

35:06.873 --> 35:10.833
And besides yourself, what other
characters feature in the book?

35:10.835 --> 35:13.376
Well, there's historical
figures, so there's James Weeks

35:13.378 --> 35:15.545
who founded
the Weeksville settlement.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.715
Um, there's
my roommates, who..

35:18.717 --> 35:22.429
Um, I don't know, it's really a..
That's a Diego question.

35:23.223 --> 35:24.808
Or Rebecca. She's in..

35:26.351 --> 35:28.558
Uh..

35:28.560 --> 35:30.395
Well,
by day's end at least.

35:32.107 --> 35:34.898
No, I... I... I like it,
too. I just..

35:34.900 --> 35:37.527
No, but that's... that's what I'm saying.
I like it too.

35:37.529 --> 35:39.027
I just can't go
any further until

35:39.029 --> 35:42.572
we have a... a... proper
conversation about it.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.909
No, with everybody.

35:51.918 --> 35:55.335
- Knock, knock.
- Hey! Nick said you were here.

35:55.337 --> 35:58.924
- He's stuck on the phone.
- Oh. Come in, come in.

36:01.636 --> 36:05.429
Honestly, I... I... I don't even
care if it is. That's your problem.

36:05.431 --> 36:06.683
Yeah, I heard that.

36:12.272 --> 36:13.355
All set?

36:14.440 --> 36:15.605
Okay.

36:17.527 --> 36:20.612
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.119
Suzanne, they're ready
for you downstairs.

37:52.121 --> 37:53.705
Okay, I'll be right down.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.208
"Yes, we shall live,
Uncle Vanya.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.878
"We shall live all through the
endless procession of days

38:00.880 --> 38:04.172
"ahead of us and through
the long evenings.

38:04.174 --> 38:08.719
"We shall bear patiently the
burdens that fate imposes on us.

38:08.721 --> 38:13.266
"We shall work without rest for
others, both now and when we are old.

38:13.268 --> 38:15.393
"And when our
final hour comes..

38:15.395 --> 38:17.228
"...we shall meet it
humbly..

38:17.230 --> 38:19.563
"...and there,
beyond the grave

38:19.565 --> 38:22.900
we will say that we have known
tears and suffering ..."

38:22.902 --> 38:23.900
Okay. very good.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.402
Um, Thank you, Ashleigh.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.279
Uh, that's, uh..

38:27.281 --> 38:28.907
Who... who wants
to go first?

38:30.284 --> 38:32.578
- Suzanne?
- I have nothing to say.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.747
- Is that good?
- No.

38:37.375 --> 38:39.208
O... okay. Is that all
you're gonna say?

38:39.210 --> 38:42.545
We've done this once a semester
for three years, Ashleigh.

38:42.547 --> 38:44.380
Done what?

38:44.382 --> 38:49.594
This is not the outfit of someone who
takes herself or her work seriously.

38:49.596 --> 38:51.429
- Oh, come on, Suzanne.
- Excuse me.

38:51.431 --> 38:53.723
I take this very,
very seriously.

38:53.725 --> 38:55.558
And I'm trying
really hard.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.933
Oh, Lord, help me.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.143
Why are you so mad?

38:58.145 --> 38:59.603
If you want me to wear
a sweater, I will.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.688
I don't want you
to do anything.

39:01.690 --> 39:03.608
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling...

39:03.610 --> 39:04.817
Yes, you are.

39:04.819 --> 39:06.067
- You're yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling at you.

39:06.069 --> 39:07.069
I'm trying to help you.

39:07.071 --> 39:08.612
Okay, um..

39:08.614 --> 39:10.782
- Suzanne, I think your point's been made.
- Scott! Stop it.

39:10.784 --> 39:12.032
Let's just move on.
Karen. What?

39:12.034 --> 39:14.242
- Stop undermining me.
- Oh, okay.

39:14.244 --> 39:15.578
Thank you.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.829
I'm sorry, Karen.

39:17.831 --> 39:19.456
- It's okay.
- Go ahead.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.920
I... I don't think the
outfit is, is that bad.

39:24.964 --> 39:28.299
If we're approaching this
practically, we have to be open

39:28.301 --> 39:31.636
and... and supportive of the
possibility that, in some cases

39:31.638 --> 39:35.306
and certainly for a beginning
actor, especially for a woman

39:35.308 --> 39:38.266
there is a certain value placed
on physical appearance...

39:38.268 --> 39:39.559
I don't know
what I'm doing here

39:39.561 --> 39:41.770
if I can't expect support
from my colleagues.

39:41.772 --> 39:43.313
Oh, I'm not dismissing
your point...

39:43.315 --> 39:45.983
I hate the way that
you are speaking to me.

39:45.985 --> 39:48.196
- Either of you! Fuck!
- Suzanne.

39:49.656 --> 39:51.116
- Fuck!
- Suzanne.

39:56.663 --> 39:58.411
It's alright.
It's alright.

40:03.377 --> 40:04.835
It's alright.

40:04.837 --> 40:08.088
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Really.

40:08.090 --> 40:09.842
Crazy, but it's okay.

40:14.429 --> 40:16.429
I said, "One more tantrum
and that's it."

40:16.431 --> 40:18.474
So..

40:18.476 --> 40:19.683
...sure enough,
10 minutes in

40:19.685 --> 40:21.476
he starts going off
on Jane...

40:21.478 --> 40:24.313
Were you in on the cooking
at all? No?

40:24.315 --> 40:27.608
I just said, I stopped the
meeting and I said, "Excuse me."

40:27.610 --> 40:31.027
And I said, you know, "Tim,
can we go out in the hall?"

40:31.029 --> 40:32.989
We walked out,
about five feet down

40:32.991 --> 40:34.824
and I just... just, I may
have said a word to him

40:34.826 --> 40:37.994
but I swiveled back
in the room

40:37.996 --> 40:39.579
and I locked the door.

40:39.581 --> 40:40.704
And I just continued
the meeting.

40:40.706 --> 40:41.998
We had a pretty
long agenda.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.126
You know, we got the..

40:45.377 --> 40:48.212
How we doing tonight,
folks? Alright.

40:48.214 --> 40:51.047
How are you tonight? 102, right
straight through, please.

41:07.984 --> 41:10.235
Okay. At the end of their life.

41:25.543 --> 41:26.795
Sorry.

41:28.003 --> 41:30.712
Foul! Foul! Foul!

41:30.714 --> 41:34.007
You're outta your mind.
You're outta your mind.

41:34.009 --> 41:37.094
No! Come on,
get your act together!

41:39.056 --> 41:42.599
Defense!
Defense!

41:42.601 --> 41:44.061
Oh, the kiss cam!

41:45.563 --> 41:46.606
The kiss cam.

I don't... I don't know
what to say.

42:41.201 --> 42:43.580

43:13.025 --> 43:15.942

I just walked in.

44:40.447 --> 44:42.070
What's going on?
You repainting?

44:42.072 --> 44:43.989
I told you that.

44:43.991 --> 44:45.284
No, you didn't.

44:46.453 --> 44:47.954
Well, I'm repainting.

44:50.790 --> 44:52.248
I thought Emilie
was coming.

44:52.250 --> 44:54.375
She's on the phone.

44:54.377 --> 44:56.045
She booked a commercial.

44:59.715 --> 45:00.967
Why are these here?

45:02.302 --> 45:03.842
- Ma?
- What?

45:03.844 --> 45:07.304
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, Nicholas, I heard you.

45:07.306 --> 45:11.141
Well, don't just throw
my things away, okay?

45:11.143 --> 45:14.478
- I live here too.
- You do not live here.

45:14.480 --> 45:17.484
"Lived."
I said "lived."

45:28.203 --> 45:29.244
Come on.

45:50.141 --> 45:51.434
We made coffee.

45:55.270 --> 45:56.397
Thank you.

45:58.942 --> 46:01.735
- Do you want some?
- No thanks.

46:21.172 --> 46:23.338
This is fine, right?

46:23.340 --> 46:24.634
Of course.

46:42.235 --> 46:44.652
- Who was it?
- A package.

46:44.654 --> 46:45.945
For me?
What is it?

46:45.947 --> 46:49.157
Ah, feels like books.

46:49.159 --> 46:51.035
Did you order books?

46:59.668 --> 47:02.337
- Is this for now?
- It is if you want it.

47:07.259 --> 47:08.594
Um..

47:26.779 --> 47:29.573
I got a letter from
Rebecca the other day.

47:36.038 --> 47:38.790
It must be hard on her
havin' you in the office.

47:38.792 --> 47:41.708
No. We don't
really interact.

47:41.710 --> 47:43.545
Our departments
are separate now.

47:44.630 --> 47:45.964
Still.

47:47.132 --> 47:49.343
It's actually easier now
than it was before.

47:50.469 --> 47:52.677
What does that mean?

47:52.679 --> 47:56.766
Just the whole thing
was such an effort.

47:56.768 --> 47:58.645
We were always trying.

48:01.980 --> 48:03.482
Not in the beginning.

48:06.319 --> 48:08.152
In the beginning,
you were in love

48:08.154 --> 48:09.614
I don't think so.

48:11.449 --> 48:13.699
I was there.

48:13.701 --> 48:16.159
Okay.

48:16.161 --> 48:18.411
If she didn't return your calls,
you were out of your mind.

48:18.413 --> 48:20.332
- You were distraught.
- Okay.

48:21.708 --> 48:25.085
- I was never distraught.
- You were obsessed.

48:25.087 --> 48:28.130
- That's your word.
- I wanted her to love me.

48:28.132 --> 48:30.007
That's not the same
as falling in love.

48:30.009 --> 48:31.677
It was like a goal.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.189
Rebecca was a person
of real consequence.

48:48.652 --> 48:51.027
- Okay.
- What?

48:51.029 --> 48:53.530
What?
What do you mean "what?"

48:53.532 --> 48:56.159
Why do you wanna
do this now?

48:56.161 --> 48:58.326
Why do you always
fucking do this?

48:58.328 --> 49:01.371
Jesus. "A person
of real consequence?"

49:01.373 --> 49:03.623
What the fuck is that?

49:03.625 --> 49:06.585
- You mean as in Emilie is not that?
- Excuse me.

49:06.587 --> 49:08.837
- Who said anything about Emilie?
- Oh, please.

49:08.839 --> 49:11.047
- I didn't. I don't even know Emilie.
- Okay.

49:11.049 --> 49:13.550
So don't try to weasel
some opinion out of me.

49:13.552 --> 49:15.887
If I want to say somethin'
about Emilie, I'll say it.

50:03.060 --> 50:04.978
And this is
the living room.

50:07.773 --> 50:11.233
Oh.
Oh, the ceilings.

50:11.235 --> 50:13.527
- Pretty great, huh?
- Great light.

50:13.529 --> 50:15.862
- Such good light.
- We love it.

50:15.864 --> 50:18.782
Oh, those bay windows.

50:18.784 --> 50:20.034
Yeah, we're really lucky.

50:20.036 --> 50:21.369
Do you have the backyard?

50:21.371 --> 50:23.161
- Yeah.
- We share it.

50:23.163 --> 50:24.288
- Share it?
- Uh-huh.

50:24.290 --> 50:26.875
But still. Very nice.

50:42.141 --> 50:45.978
Do your... kids ask
where you go?

50:48.105 --> 50:49.982
They're not really
interested.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.359
- Sure, now.
- I know.

53:09.621 --> 53:11.457
Do you hate me tonight?

53:13.375 --> 53:15.375
What?

53:15.377 --> 53:16.753
Do you hate me?

53:23.261 --> 53:24.512
Of course not.

53:33.730 --> 53:35.106
Do you hate me?

53:38.400 --> 53:40.736
- I'm very hateable.
- No.

53:43.239 --> 53:44.824
Then there's no hate.

53:57.295 --> 53:59.255
Hope I hate anybody.

54:18.398 --> 54:20.690
I can't stick it out.
Is that okay?

54:20.692 --> 54:22.610
Mm. There's nothing
to do now.

54:22.612 --> 54:24.570
I'm just re-reading
her emails.

54:24.572 --> 54:26.864
- She's an idiot.
- You want me to call Paul?

54:26.866 --> 54:29.866
- No.
- Wait, are you angry?

54:29.868 --> 54:32.161
It's the second time she's pushed.
She's being a shit.

54:32.163 --> 54:33.996
Yeah.
She's just embarrassed.

54:33.998 --> 54:36.876
She'll send you a long
apology email tomorrow.

54:38.418 --> 54:40.672
I left some Szechwan
in the fridge.

54:43.257 --> 54:44.507
You hear me?

54:44.509 --> 54:46.259
- Are you leaving now?
- Uh-huh.

54:46.261 --> 54:48.596
I'll walk down with you.
I called a car.

54:50.264 --> 54:51.639
Are you taking
the train?

54:51.641 --> 54:53.516
Yeah, traffic's
gonna be shitty.

54:53.518 --> 54:55.101
Okay. Well,
I'll see you later.

54:55.103 --> 54:56.146
Night.

54:59.107 --> 55:01.148
Hi. Thanks.

55:01.150 --> 55:02.734
Do you have the address?

55:05.487 --> 55:07.237
Whoa, whoa.
I'm sorry.

55:07.239 --> 55:09.407
- What are you doing?
- Whoa!

55:09.409 --> 55:13.034
I just, uh, I realized I
don't have anywhere to be.

55:13.036 --> 55:15.579
So I thought I could just
ride with you and..

55:15.581 --> 55:18.666
Drop you off and take the
car home, if that's okay.

55:18.668 --> 55:20.753
- Okay. Yeah.
- Great.

55:25.717 --> 55:27.257
I mean, we should probably
have an answer if we're goin'

55:27.259 --> 55:29.509
in the morning anyway,
right?

55:29.511 --> 55:30.596
Uh-huh.

55:43.610 --> 55:44.903
What?

55:47.112 --> 55:49.279
I.. I don't know,
it's just..

55:49.281 --> 55:51.866
- I'm having a...
- I know.

55:51.868 --> 55:52.951
You know what?

55:53.828 --> 55:55.079
Like..

55:56.371 --> 55:58.457
...like, emotional spins,
right?

55:59.875 --> 56:02.211
- Emotional spins?
- Yeah.

56:03.962 --> 56:06.256
I don't even know
what that is.

56:24.484 --> 56:26.817
- So, um..
- Goodbye, Nick.

56:26.819 --> 56:28.696
Alright.
See you tomorrow.

56:31.406 --> 56:33.574
Goodnight, Nicholas.

56:33.576 --> 56:36.576
Uh, Becca,
just wait a second.

56:36.578 --> 56:39.413
- Nick, this is weird.
- No, it's not.

56:39.415 --> 56:41.081
I'll see you tomorrow.
Just go home.

56:41.083 --> 56:43.166
I just, I need
to use the bathroom.

56:43.168 --> 56:45.460
- Whose bathroom?
- I'll be fast.

56:45.462 --> 56:47.337
- No, you can't come up.
- Why not?

56:47.339 --> 56:49.632
Nick, go.

56:49.634 --> 56:51.300
Why are you being like..

56:51.302 --> 56:53.511
I'm..
We're just talking.

56:53.513 --> 56:55.637
What, I can't
talk to you now?

56:55.639 --> 56:58.099
Okay, fine, fine,
but don't leave like this.

56:58.101 --> 57:00.476
I'm not leaving like anything.
I'm going to my apartment.

57:00.478 --> 57:01.768
You can't just stop
for a second?

57:01.770 --> 57:03.980
Go home, Nick.

57:03.982 --> 57:05.692
You're making this worse.

57:06.609 --> 57:09.025
Okay, come on.
Becca.

57:09.027 --> 57:12.697
- Come on! Rebecca!
- Oh, my God! Enough!

57:12.699 --> 57:14.114
What, you're just gonna
leave like this?

57:14.116 --> 57:15.741
- Come on, let's go.
- Nice, Rebecca!

57:15.743 --> 57:18.286
Real fuckin' nice!
Nice job!

57:18.288 --> 57:19.871
- Hey, come on.
- Oh, fuck off!

57:19.873 --> 57:22.831
...old people next to, or,
like, at the same table

57:22.833 --> 57:25.668
as other people, and it
was kind of a disaster.

57:25.670 --> 57:28.170
I'd have like hives up and
down my arms that's what..

57:28.172 --> 57:31.047
That's what they gave me
the Benadryl for.

57:31.049 --> 57:32.842
- Yeah.
- Um, yeah.

57:32.844 --> 57:35.761
I didn't last too long
there, I loved it.

57:35.763 --> 57:37.889
I stole their muffins.
Do you remember them?

57:37.891 --> 57:41.308
I think that's a classic server
move to steal all muffins.

57:41.310 --> 57:42.976
All muffins
should be always stolen.

57:42.978 --> 57:44.395
Yeah.

57:44.397 --> 57:46.898
That's crazy, though,
so when..

57:46.900 --> 57:49.650
...when you were, like, serving people,
you had, like, hives on your...

57:49.652 --> 57:52.652
I don't know what it was. I think
I was just allergic to something.

57:52.654 --> 57:55.405
It wasn't the cleanest..

57:55.407 --> 57:56.991
...diner experience.

57:56.993 --> 57:58.617
You should have seen
the place we stayed.

57:58.619 --> 58:01.286
- She wanted to move in.
- Oh, it was unbelievable.

58:01.288 --> 58:03.581
Old original architecture
with this beautiful balcony.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.877
You know, it just feels like
you're in another country.

58:07.252 --> 58:09.503
God, that smells good.

58:09.505 --> 58:11.257
Make some room over there.

58:13.884 --> 58:16.886
Here, let's just
put that down there.

58:16.888 --> 58:19.596
Yeah, there.. Yeah, there are all
those weird people who just don't..

58:19.598 --> 58:21.224
- May I?
- I ju.. I... I..

58:21.226 --> 58:23.643
- Don't use money, I guess.
- Thanks.

58:23.645 --> 58:25.478
I don't know.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.273
You decide, Karen.

58:28.857 --> 58:31.483
- Mm-hmm.
- I have friends who live there.

58:31.485 --> 58:33.277
Terrific music.

58:33.279 --> 58:35.070
Michael loves jazz.

58:35.072 --> 58:36.947
Always have.

58:36.949 --> 58:39.368
I mean, Coltrane, Monk,
you know.

58:40.453 --> 58:44.038
Uh, I even like bad jazz,
really.

58:44.040 --> 58:46.581
It was so.. It was just so funny,
you know, he... he... he..

58:46.583 --> 58:48.668
We would go looking for
these out-of-way places.

58:48.670 --> 58:50.378
He would go up to people
on the street.

58:50.380 --> 58:54.172
I didn't want to get trapped
in the touristy places.

58:54.174 --> 58:55.342
You know..

58:56.386 --> 58:57.969
I mean,
you're in New Orleans.

58:57.971 --> 58:59.177
I wanted the real thing.

58:59.179 --> 59:00.762
Do you know a man

59:00.764 --> 59:03.266
who has been in love
with only one woman?

59:03.268 --> 59:05.311
There certainly
are such men.

59:06.311 --> 59:09.188
Are they amongst
your friends?

59:09.190 --> 59:10.565
Tell me his name.

59:10.567 --> 59:12.567
I have no name
to tell you

59:12.569 --> 59:14.067
but I do believe
that there are men

59:14.069 --> 59:16.154
capable of loving..

59:16.156 --> 59:17.489
...but once.

59:18.991 --> 59:21.743
How often
can a true man love?

59:23.288 --> 59:25.704
What are you trying
to find out?

59:25.706 --> 59:27.833
Ask.
I'll answer it.

59:30.837 --> 59:33.047
Am I right to stay
in the convent?

59:34.507 --> 59:36.340
No.

59:36.342 --> 59:38.592
- Cool, right?
- Yeah, I liked it.

59:38.594 --> 59:40.638
I've never been
backstage before.

59:41.889 --> 59:43.681
Oh, there he is.

59:43.683 --> 59:45.599
- Oh. Matthew.
- Hey.

59:45.601 --> 59:47.518
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you!

59:47.520 --> 59:49.645
- You were just wonderful.
- Thank you. I think it went pretty well.

59:49.647 --> 59:51.855
So do I. Matthew,
this is my friend Michael.

59:51.857 --> 59:52.982
Michael, this is Matthew.

59:52.984 --> 59:54.525
- He played Perdican.
- Of course.

59:54.527 --> 59:55.902
- Hey!
- Hey!

59:55.904 --> 59:57.652
- You were awesome.
- Thank you!

59:57.654 --> 59:59.864
Ashleigh, you were fantastic.
It was great.

59:59.866 --> 01:00:02.032
Oh, thank you.
Hi, I'm Ashleigh.

01:00:02.034 --> 01:00:03.659

I thought I had them
in this pocket.

01:02:37.107 --> 01:02:39.232
- What, your phone?
- No, my keys.

01:02:39.234 --> 01:02:40.358
- My house key.
- Oh, no.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.445
- You lost them?
- Oh, got it.

01:02:44.447 --> 01:02:46.032
Um..

01:03:34.246 --> 01:03:36.581
Hey.

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:39.335
- Why are you up?
- It's morning.

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:47.175
Where were you?

01:03:47.177 --> 01:03:50.096
Oh, I just, uh,
took Karen home.

01:03:51.096 --> 01:03:53.598
How is she?

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.018
Nicholas.

01:03:56.435 --> 01:03:58.270
How is Karen?

01:03:59.272 --> 01:04:01.438
Uh, I don't know
what you mean.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.900
You don't?

01:04:04.777 --> 01:04:06.361
She's alive.

01:04:08.989 --> 01:04:10.491
Come on, Max.

01:04:13.578 --> 01:04:16.288
Uh, what time
did you guys get in?

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:21.958
Ma? You're not gonna
answer me?

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.337
What does it matter
what time we got in?

01:04:24.339 --> 01:04:25.965
Why are you pissed?

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:32.096
Well, good morning.

01:04:33.848 --> 01:04:35.558
You smell.

01:04:38.143 --> 01:04:40.143
Okay.

01:04:40.145 --> 01:04:42.439
Well,
I'm going to go to bed.

01:05:31.239 --> 01:05:33.780
I did that. Yeah.

01:05:35.118 --> 01:05:36.992
- I loved that job.
- You did?

01:05:36.994 --> 01:05:38.786
Yeah, I actually did.
Like..

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:44.461
Let's see.
Let's give you this one.

01:05:49.382 --> 01:05:51.176
Hey, Miss Floy.

01:05:52.886 --> 01:05:54.302
Mm!

01:05:54.304 --> 01:05:56.055
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

01:05:59.058 --> 01:06:01.768
I'll take that.
Is this free?

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:03.268
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm gonna use this.

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:05.480
That's just
orange juice there.

01:06:05.482 --> 01:06:06.521
Aren't you hot?

01:06:06.523 --> 01:06:09.150
You're wearing
a sweater too.

01:06:09.152 --> 01:06:10.487
Hey.

01:06:12.906 --> 01:06:14.574
- You want some juice?
- Yeah.

01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:22.706
Perfect.

01:06:27.628 --> 01:06:28.920
Um, silverware?

01:06:28.922 --> 01:06:31.797
Oh, this,
this drawer right here.

01:06:34.092 --> 01:06:35.509
Last night..

01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:37.513
What do you think
of this guy?

01:06:39.098 --> 01:06:40.764
It should be
the other way around.

01:06:40.766 --> 01:06:43.141
- Michael?
- No.

01:06:43.143 --> 01:06:44.395
Um..

01:06:45.772 --> 01:06:49.190
I don't know.
He's nice enough, right?

01:06:49.192 --> 01:06:51.025
- I feel bad.
- No, you're fine.

01:06:51.027 --> 01:06:53.569
And if that's
the real question or not.

01:06:53.571 --> 01:06:54.945
If it is..

01:06:54.947 --> 01:06:57.116
I don't know
how to behave.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.791
- Chris, can you get these?
- Yeah.

01:07:06.793 --> 01:07:09.626
- I can do it.
- Chris!

01:07:09.628 --> 01:07:11.337
- Ma, I'm doing it.
- What?

01:07:11.339 --> 01:07:12.674
He's doing it.

01:07:14.509 --> 01:07:16.007
You hear her?

01:07:16.009 --> 01:07:17.302
What?

01:07:19.639 --> 01:07:21.639
Oh,
who needs some coffee?

01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:24.766
- I'll have one.
- I have some.

01:07:24.768 --> 01:07:26.936
We should say
something.

01:07:26.938 --> 01:07:29.563
- I think...
- No, no, I think I'm gonna say something.

01:07:29.565 --> 01:07:31.023
No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

01:07:31.025 --> 01:07:33.067
What? No, no, no, no.
Just a little.

01:07:35.779 --> 01:07:37.697
I just want to say
a little something

01:07:37.699 --> 01:07:41.159
in honor of our
new guest.

01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:44.161
Happy birthday,
Michael.

01:07:44.163 --> 01:07:46.413
We are very happy
to have you here.

01:07:46.415 --> 01:07:49.041
Very happy.

01:07:49.043 --> 01:07:51.626
Thank you.

01:07:51.628 --> 01:07:53.628
And, of course, to, uh..

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:57.257
To little,
uh, uh, Zachary.

01:07:57.259 --> 01:08:00.095
Um, who's also here.

01:08:02.514 --> 01:08:05.849
To Michael and..

01:08:05.851 --> 01:08:07.561
...to, um..

01:08:09.272 --> 01:08:11.230
...this..

01:08:11.232 --> 01:08:13.398
...special..

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.194
...thing that's happening
right before our eyes.

01:08:17.196 --> 01:08:19.654
Even though..

01:08:19.656 --> 01:08:22.283
...we're desperately trying
not to notice, it is.

01:08:22.285 --> 01:08:25.868
And I think it's right
that we celebrate that.

01:08:25.871 --> 01:08:29.747
So, to Michael and mom.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.042
Cheers.

01:08:31.044 --> 01:08:32.042
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:08:32.044 --> 01:08:33.377
Hear, hear.

01:08:40.969 --> 01:08:42.930
You wanna say something,
Michael?

01:08:45.557 --> 01:08:46.640
You don't have
to say anything.

01:08:46.642 --> 01:08:49.018
I think you're
doing great.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.270
Thank you.

01:08:51.438 --> 01:08:53.395
Nothing?

01:08:53.398 --> 01:08:56.567
- Would you like me to?
- Yeah.

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:59.403
Sure. Uh..

01:08:59.404 --> 01:09:02.363
This has gotta be
really hard.

01:09:02.366 --> 01:09:04.698
Ah..

01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:08.162
I thank you for
welcoming me here.

01:09:08.163 --> 01:09:11.207
Uh, however you have.

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:14.585
It can't have been easy.
I understand that.

01:09:14.587 --> 01:09:17.505
And it had to call on
some reserves.

01:09:17.506 --> 01:09:19.631
And I had
a great dinner.

01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:22.260
And you were very nice
to my guy.

01:09:22.261 --> 01:09:24.845
So, thank you.

01:09:24.846 --> 01:09:26.223
Hear, hear.

01:09:28.225 --> 01:09:30.768
To Michael.

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.603
- To Michael.
- To Michael.

01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:34.898
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:09:40.571 --> 01:09:43.448
It's hard to know,
you know, what to..

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:46.118
It's right to ce...
to celebrate it in..

01:09:47.911 --> 01:09:50.203
...some fucking way,
but it's..

01:09:50.205 --> 01:09:52.747
I don't know what to say.

01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:55.626
- You did great.
- Thank you.

01:09:55.628 --> 01:09:57.545
It's not like
there's, uh..

01:09:57.547 --> 01:10:00.965
It's not like
there's a card for..

01:10:00.967 --> 01:10:04.426
...good luck with your
new relationship

01:10:04.428 --> 01:10:06.054
older people.

01:10:12.312 --> 01:10:14.063
That's enough, Nicholas.

01:10:21.279 --> 01:10:23.613
It's hard to know, isn't it?
It's hard to know what to say.

01:10:23.615 --> 01:10:25.032
Stop!

01:10:40.839 --> 01:10:42.342
Thank you.

01:11:04.905 --> 01:11:07.908
Zach, uh,
you wanna help me clear?

01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:31.850
- You're so selfish.
- Nick.

01:11:35.727 --> 01:11:37.060
- You're so self...
- Nick!

01:11:37.062 --> 01:11:38.895
Shut up.

01:11:38.897 --> 01:11:40.857
Where are you..
Wait. Wait!

01:11:40.859 --> 01:11:43.359
- Let her go! Nick.
- You should've asked.

01:11:43.361 --> 01:11:45.278
- You should've asked!
- Don't do that to her!

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.155
- Dick!
- You should have asked!

01:11:48.157 --> 01:11:50.323
- Ah!
- Nicholas! Nicholas, no!

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:52.326
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!

01:11:52.328 --> 01:11:54.287
Nicholas! Ugh!

01:11:54.289 --> 01:11:56.079
- Come on! Come on!
- Get off him, Nick!

01:11:56.081 --> 01:11:57.331
- Get off him!
- Goddamn it!

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:58.793
Oh!

01:12:01.504 --> 01:12:02.797
Jackass.

01:12:56.476 --> 01:13:00.478
And, um, he comes along
and he..

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.145
...he's got his
own tricks.

01:13:02.147 --> 01:13:04.482
He's got a few of his
own tricks up his sleeve.

01:13:04.484 --> 01:13:07.777
I mean,
he can walk on water.

01:13:07.779 --> 01:13:10.363
He can turn water
into wine.

01:13:10.365 --> 01:13:11.863
Ain't he? Uh, you get
what I'm saying?

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:13.282
I think everything he did

01:13:13.284 --> 01:13:16.284
was kind of a step down
from the old man.

01:13:16.286 --> 01:13:18.537
Like..

01:13:18.539 --> 01:13:19.997
...water into wine?

01:13:19.999 --> 01:13:21.916
Congratulations,
that's a great trick.

01:13:21.918 --> 01:13:25.627
Um... you... he, your dad
made both of those

01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:27.380
out of hydrogen
and oxygen

01:13:27.382 --> 01:13:30.507
which he also made..

01:13:30.509 --> 01:13:32.342
...out of shit
that he made

01:13:32.344 --> 01:13:33.594
out of shit that he made

01:13:33.596 --> 01:13:35.680
that we don't
even know about yet.

01:13:35.682 --> 01:13:38.850
Um, okay,
so Jesus multiplied

01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:41.435
a bunch of bread
and fishes.

01:13:41.437 --> 01:13:44.315
Like, that's a great trick
if your dad is David Blaine.

01:13:45.691 --> 01:13:49.068
But, um..

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:50.610
...that ain't shit
when we're talking about

01:13:50.612 --> 01:13:54.364
wormholes, and antimatter.

01:13:54.366 --> 01:13:56.492
That's like,
that's some

01:13:56.494 --> 01:13:58.243
Frank Sinatra, Jr. shit
right there

01:13:58.245 --> 01:13:59.537
is what I call that.

01:13:59.539 --> 01:14:00.704
That's not even..

01:14:00.706 --> 01:14:02.873
That's not even
Julian Lennon.

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:06.543
That's like a Sean Lennon
body of work.

01:14:06.545 --> 01:14:08.296
"Hey, Dad."
"What?"

01:14:08.298 --> 01:14:11.549
"Um, uh,
I make cabinets."

01:14:11.551 --> 01:14:15.051
"I want..
You want an armoire?"

01:14:15.053 --> 01:14:17.181
"I created light."

01:14:18.432 --> 01:14:21.350
"Back off, moron."

01:14:21.352 --> 01:14:23.394
I don't know, I just feel,
I lost my dad

01:14:23.396 --> 01:14:24.729
so I feel a little..

01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:27.064
It's hard
to live up to him.

01:14:27.066 --> 01:14:29.734
Maybe that's coloring
my thoughts right now.

01:14:29.736 --> 01:14:32.903
Uh, apple falls far
from the tree sometimes.

01:14:32.905 --> 01:14:37.158
I did, um, I did,
I just lost my dad.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.909
Uh, my father
passed away.

01:14:38.911 --> 01:14:41.578
That's something that Jesus
never had to deal with.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.500
One of the perks
of dying at 33.

01:14:45.502 --> 01:14:48.920
When your dad's
immortal anyway, like..

01:14:48.922 --> 01:14:51.588
He didn't have
to go through this.

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:53.757
Or like,
sell a house ever.

01:14:53.759 --> 01:14:55.386
Jesus never had
to do that.

01:14:57.137 --> 01:15:00.348
And I feel like,
oh, if my dad just died

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:02.100
I'm starting to worry about
myself 'cause I've heard

01:15:02.102 --> 01:15:04.354
that kind of thing runs
in the family, you know?

01:15:06.271 --> 01:15:08.355
Anybody else
lose anybody recently?

01:15:08.357 --> 01:15:10.524
Yeah, it sucks.
My dad, gone.

01:15:10.526 --> 01:15:12.818
Just like,
that whole stick figure

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.322
just wiped off
the back of my minivan.

01:15:16.324 --> 01:15:18.198
That must be a sad job

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.119
down at the gas station.

01:15:23.164 --> 01:15:26.332
That takes an auto detailer
with a certain finesse

01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:29.042
to be able to, like,
scrape the family member

01:15:29.044 --> 01:15:30.672
off the back of the..

01:15:33.465 --> 01:15:35.341
...van.

01:15:35.343 --> 01:15:37.676
Um, but you know,
it's tough.

01:15:37.678 --> 01:15:39.595
It's tough when you go
through losing a loved one.

01:15:39.597 --> 01:15:40.971
Someone you grew up with

01:15:40.973 --> 01:15:44.183
someone you admire
or hate or..

01:15:44.185 --> 01:15:47.144
...hatemire.

01:15:47.146 --> 01:15:49.146
Um, and then, like,
you... you

01:15:49.148 --> 01:15:51.232
you put them away
forever.

01:15:51.234 --> 01:15:55.110
Put 'em away? What? I don't think
that's the right terminology.

01:15:55.112 --> 01:15:56.280
Yep.

01:15:58.825 --> 01:16:00.118
Put that away.

01:16:01.703 --> 01:16:03.243
That's the wo..
I don't underst..

01:16:03.245 --> 01:16:08.498
When you have the ashes,
what are we saving them for?

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.917
Uh, it's a bit like,
it's a ho..

01:16:09.919 --> 01:16:11.627
It's like, when you save
ornaments for Christmas

01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:13.753
but it's not every year.

01:16:13.755 --> 01:16:16.882
Every 50 years,
they, they get up

01:16:16.884 --> 01:16:19.801
and dance like
Tinker Bell.

01:16:19.803 --> 01:16:21.470
I don't understand
why we save the ashes.

01:16:21.472 --> 01:16:25.224
I couldn't convince 'em
to get rid of 'em.

01:16:25.226 --> 01:16:28.019
Um, but you know..

01:16:28.021 --> 01:16:30.438
...you lose somebody and then
you're like, "Well, what next?"

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.357
And you've, we've all
lost somebody or..

01:16:33.359 --> 01:16:34.734
If you haven't,
then you're gonna lose

01:16:34.736 --> 01:16:37.113
a whole lot all at once,
I guess.

01:16:38.865 --> 01:16:40.366
Sorry.

01:16:41.825 --> 01:16:45.286
Um, but then you're like,
"Oh, okay.

01:16:45.288 --> 01:16:47.704
"This is sad, this is
very sad primarily.

01:16:47.706 --> 01:16:49.207
And then what?
What's next?"

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:52.877
And... nothing.
Nothing happens.

01:16:52.879 --> 01:16:55.337
Everybody, like, wipes their
hands and they're like..

01:16:55.339 --> 01:16:58.882
"Great. You good?" "Um, I guess.
Yeah, I guess I'm good."

01:16:58.884 --> 01:17:01.885
"I'm hungry primarily."
"Yeah, let's go eat."

01:17:01.887 --> 01:17:04.221
And then, well, we got
a large group of people.

01:17:04.223 --> 01:17:07.600
"Uh, Olive Garden." And, so
you end up at Olive Garden.

01:17:07.602 --> 01:17:09.601
My dad was dead
for like 12 minutes

01:17:09.603 --> 01:17:11.520
and we were diving
face-first

01:17:11.522 --> 01:17:13.357
into pans of lasagna.

01:17:15.151 --> 01:17:17.109
Okay.

01:17:17.111 --> 01:17:19.194
I feel like
I'm at a..

01:17:19.196 --> 01:17:22.198
I feel like
I'm at a funeral here.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.117
But I guess
I'm trying to say

01:17:24.119 --> 01:17:26.161
as shitty as death is..

01:17:29.081 --> 01:17:31.623
...it's almost worse

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:34.918
how easy it is to get
over somebody dying.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.340
Like, you expect
that when you die

01:17:39.342 --> 01:17:40.675
everyone
in the whole world

01:17:40.677 --> 01:17:42.510
is gonna be consumed
with grief.

01:17:42.512 --> 01:17:44.595
Like, they're gonna thr..

01:17:44.597 --> 01:17:47.305
Like CNN is gonna,
like, weep

01:17:47.307 --> 01:17:50.600
and they're gonna throw
themselves on a funeral pyre

01:17:50.602 --> 01:17:53.563
which they brought back
into fashion for you.

01:17:53.565 --> 01:17:54.896
And none of that happens.

01:17:54.898 --> 01:17:57.315
Everybody at the funeral
is drunk that night

01:17:57.317 --> 01:18:01.112
and they're back to work at
most, like, later that week.

01:18:01.114 --> 01:18:03.780
"Your loss." And then
they're just at work.

01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:07.284
It's just an excuse to be 10
minutes late to work for a month.

01:18:07.286 --> 01:18:10.121
"My dad died. Yeah.

01:18:10.123 --> 01:18:12.290
"Yeah, it's tough.
My dad died.

01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:15.128
I'll, I'll get right
on that, I promise."

01:18:17.254 --> 01:18:19.171
- Hi. You all set?
- Hi.

01:18:19.173 --> 01:18:22.466
You guys are great.
You guys are great.

01:18:22.468 --> 01:18:24.760
I feel comfortable talking
about death with you guys

01:18:24.762 --> 01:18:28.139
'cause it feels like I'm halfway
in the grave right now with you.

01:18:28.141 --> 01:18:29.140
Wake up, dumb-dumb.

01:18:29.142 --> 01:18:30.558
Um..

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560
I'm almost done.
We all are.

01:18:32.562 --> 01:18:34.979
Just a few more decades
at most.

01:18:34.981 --> 01:18:35.982
Oh, no,
don't do that.

01:18:40.027 --> 01:18:42.444
Every funeral is basically the same.
We're not that special.

01:18:42.446 --> 01:18:44.029
Whatever, whoever
the fuck you were

01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:46.407
they have, they have, like,
a script they read from.

01:18:46.409 --> 01:18:48.576
"He was a loving father."

01:18:48.578 --> 01:18:50.661
It's all cliches.
Every funeral.

01:18:50.663 --> 01:18:52.872
"He was a loving father,
he's in a better place."

01:18:52.874 --> 01:18:56.626
"She's in peace now."
Have an original thought!

01:18:56.628 --> 01:18:59.878
Why are these cliches? What
are you, Jon Bon Jovi?

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.922
Get into some
deep shit for me.

01:19:01.924 --> 01:19:04.341
"I wonder if he was
still alive

01:19:04.343 --> 01:19:06.804
after he died
for a minute?"

01:19:10.808 --> 01:19:12.558
Say that
at the gravesite.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.520
That's what the kids
are thinking.

01:19:16.522 --> 01:19:20.360
I won... I wonder if like,
his kneecap's still alive.

01:19:32.789 --> 01:19:34.249
He's coming up.

01:19:37.127 --> 01:19:38.210
You there?

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:04.446
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:20:20.335 --> 01:20:21.588
What do you think
of this?

01:20:23.464 --> 01:20:25.048
- Your shirt?
- Uh-huh.

01:20:25.924 --> 01:20:27.550
I like it.

01:20:27.552 --> 01:20:28.634
I've been buying these.

01:20:29.678 --> 01:20:31.429
I thought I liked the cut.

01:20:31.431 --> 01:20:32.430
It feels so bright now.

01:20:32.432 --> 01:20:33.767
No, it fits well.

01:20:34.433 --> 01:20:35.433
Thank you.

01:20:44.067 --> 01:20:45.650
- You didn't read it?
- No.

01:20:49.072 --> 01:20:50.657
I'll read it
when I want to.

01:20:52.326 --> 01:20:54.788
I'm not gonna sit here
in front of you.

01:20:58.290 --> 01:20:59.750
What are you getting?

01:21:00.459 --> 01:21:02.083
Uh, maybe a soup.

01:21:02.085 --> 01:21:03.504
Are you gonna eat?

01:21:05.507 --> 01:21:06.840
Can't decide.

01:21:21.021 --> 01:21:22.981
So I've been staying
with Chris.

01:21:24.566 --> 01:21:25.819
He told me.

01:21:27.152 --> 01:21:28.237
Right.

01:22:16.619 --> 01:22:17.868
What are you thinkin'?

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:18.996
Nicholas.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.337
Becca, what?

01:22:30.883 --> 01:22:32.051
Nicholas..

01:22:37.932 --> 01:22:39.726
Let's not do this.

01:22:54.574 --> 01:22:55.657
Thank you.

01:23:19.723 --> 01:23:22.265
- Have you seen Nick?
- He went downstairs.

01:23:22.267 --> 01:23:24.268
Well, he's got my shoes.

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:26.979
Um, do you know
if he's all dressed?

01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:29.023
He had a problem
with his key.

01:23:29.025 --> 01:23:31.192
- So he's gonna come back here?
- Chris.

01:23:31.194 --> 01:23:32.609
What? My shoes
are in his room.

01:23:32.611 --> 01:23:34.112
Would you want me to not
wear shoes all day?

01:23:34.114 --> 01:23:36.238
I want you to take care
of your own sorry self.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.616
I'm trying to,
but I'm wearing socks.

01:24:22.035 --> 01:24:23.702
Oh, hey!

01:24:23.704 --> 01:24:24.828
You know,
that was beautiful.

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:26.583
Thank you.
Good to see you.

01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:29.000
Hey, they're still warm.

01:24:29.002 --> 01:24:31.004
- Right over there.
- Hey, you made it.

01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:35.840
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Paul.

01:25:08.624 --> 01:25:09.791
She said..

01:25:14.379 --> 01:25:15.505
That means I'm taller.

01:25:15.507 --> 01:25:16.881
Yeah!

01:25:16.883 --> 01:25:18.341
Claire wants
to say goodbye.

01:25:18.343 --> 01:25:19.341
- Come help me with the table.
- Okay.

01:25:19.343 --> 01:25:21.676
I'll be out
in five minutes.

01:25:21.678 --> 01:25:22.763
I will!

01:25:23.472 --> 01:25:24.555
Is it nice?

01:25:24.557 --> 01:25:26.431
- It's fucking genius.
- So nice!

01:25:26.433 --> 01:25:28.518
I haven't used it yet.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.394
You know, uh, Chris
doesn't like your place.

01:25:31.396 --> 01:25:32.896
Yeah, that's what I said.

01:25:32.898 --> 01:25:34.398
- That's exactly what I said.
- That's what he said.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.900
I was like, "I don't
like mom's new place."

01:25:36.902 --> 01:25:39.069
What do you mean,
you don't like it?

01:25:39.071 --> 01:25:40.238
I didn't say anything

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.572
and that got construed as

01:25:41.574 --> 01:25:44.283
"Chris hates
mom's new place."

01:25:44.285 --> 01:25:45.408
Chris, what are
you wearing?

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:46.952
Are you naked?

01:25:46.954 --> 01:25:47.953
I didn't wear
any underwear.

01:25:47.955 --> 01:25:49.788
To your grandmother's
funeral?

01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:51.040
- Chris..
- Oh, my..

01:25:51.042 --> 01:25:52.917
What do you want from me?

01:25:52.919 --> 01:25:54.961
Underwear.

01:25:54.963 --> 01:25:56.753
It doesn't
affect you, man.

01:25:56.755 --> 01:25:58.381
Nick, will you help me
with the table?

01:25:58.383 --> 01:26:00.802
Just... stay a minute.

01:26:03.972 --> 01:26:05.512
Whoo! Mm!

01:26:05.514 --> 01:26:06.680
Yeah, give it a sit.

01:26:06.682 --> 01:26:08.933
Nice.

01:26:08.935 --> 01:26:10.600
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:26:10.602 --> 01:26:13.311
Chris, would you just
cover yourself?

01:26:13.313 --> 01:26:16.357
Why?
I am totally beautiful.

01:26:18.986 --> 01:26:20.864
- Come on, Nick.
- Okay.

01:26:33.668 --> 01:26:35.128
