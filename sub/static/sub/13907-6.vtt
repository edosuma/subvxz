I CAN GO NO FURTHER.

14:32.011 --> 14:35.016
I, MOJO JOJO,
HAVE KNOCKED YOU OUT.

14:35.018 --> 14:38.021
I HAVE PUT YOU IN A STATE
OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

14:38.023 --> 14:40.025
HA, HA! I LAUGH
AT YOUR PAIN.

14:40.027 --> 14:43.017
I MAKE A SOUND OF PLEASURE
AT YOUR SHORTCOMINGS.

14:43.019 --> 14:46.002
I DO THIS BECAUSE I AM BAD.

14:46.004 --> 14:47.003
I AM EVIL.

14:47.005 --> 14:50.023
I AM MOJO JOJO.

COULD SHE BE?

16:01.010 --> 16:03.024
THESE ARE HER BANDAGES.

16:03.026 --> 16:04.027
SHE'S NOT UNDER HERE.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.013
THIS ISN'T LIKE HER.
[PHONE BEEPS]

16:06.015 --> 16:08.025
HAH! THE HOT LINE.
WHAT IS IT, MAYOR?

16:08.027 --> 16:12.000
BLOSSOM, MOJO JOJO
IS DESTROYING SOHO

16:12.002 --> 16:15.017
WITH HIS ROBO
JOJO AND THAT'S
A BIG NO-NO.

16:15.019 --> 16:17.008
SO HURRY UP
AND GO-GO.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.029
OH, NO. BUTTERCUP,
LET'S MOVE OUT.

16:20.001 --> 16:21.004
BUT WHAT ABOUT BUBBLES?

16:21.006 --> 16:23.005
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT NOW.

16:23.007 --> 16:24.027

TROUBLE AGAIN.

16:24.029 --> 16:26.014
Narrator: HURRY, GIRLS, HURRY!

16:26.016 --> 16:31.022
MOJO'S GOT A BIG, MEAN
DESTRUCTION MACHINE.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.018

16:39.029 --> 16:41.026
THAT'S MOJO JOJO
ALL RIGHT.

16:41.028 --> 16:45.000
YES. HE'S CERTAINLY
OUTDONE HIMSELF
THIS TIME.

16:45.002 --> 16:47.001
HERE HE COMES.
HOLD YOUR GROUND.

16:47.003 --> 16:49.010

WOULD BE MUCH MORE MENACING

16:49.012 --> 16:52.005
IF IT WERE ACTUALLY

16:52.007 --> 16:54.004
WOULDN'T IT?

TAKE THIS AND
THAT AND SOME OF THIS
AND ONE OF THOSE.

17:00.006 --> 17:01.027
BUTTERCUP, IF
MOJO JOJO IS HERE,

17:01.029 --> 17:05.005
THEN HE CAN'T
POSSIBLY BE THE ONE
DESTROYING TOWNSVILLE.

17:05.007 --> 17:07.016
THEN WHO IS IN
THE ROBO JOJO?

17:07.018 --> 17:10.024
WHY DON'T YOU
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.015
I AM NOT BUBBLES.
BUBBLES IS NOT WHO I AM.

17:40.017 --> 17:45.014
I AM THE ONE
THE ONLY SINGLE SOLITARY
DOER OF DASTARDLY DEEDS.

17:45.016 --> 17:49.010
PURVEYOR OF PESTILENCE
AND DELIVERER OF LAWLESSNESS.

IS MUCH DIFFERENT.

18:00.025 --> 18:04.020
I DO NOT REITERATE.
REPEAT: REINSTATE THE SAME
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

18:04.022 --> 18:07.008

TO TO THE POINT. I--

AND SOME OF THIS
AND ONE OF THOSE.

18:10.024 --> 18:14.001
WHAT KIND OF EVIL
HAVE YOU BESTOWED
UPON OUR SISTER?

18:14.003 --> 18:15.014
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

18:15.016 --> 18:18.020
I'M WET. I'M NAKED.
YOUR SISTER IS WEARING
MY CLOTHES.

18:18.022 --> 18:20.009
AND THIS IS ALL PART
OF SOME EVIL PLOT

18:20.011 --> 18:23.020
TO RULE THE WORLD AS A SOGGY
CHIMP IN MY BIRTHDAY SUIT?

18:23.022 --> 18:26.009
BUTTERCUP, I DON'T THINK
MOJO'S BEHIND THIS ONE.

18:26.011 --> 18:31.016
THAT BUMP TO BUBBLES' HEAD
MUST HAVE LED HER TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE IS MOJO JOJO.

NO? REALLY?
DO YOU THINK?

18:33.012 --> 18:35.010

THIS TOMFOOLERY.

FURTHERMORE, SHUT UP!

REALLY HURT.

18:58.002 --> 19:01.026

BUT TWO WRONGS
DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.

YOU HIT HER.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.008
SUDDENLY, WE'RE ALL
HITTING EACH OTHER.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.018

BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

NO, BUTTERCUP.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE IS OUR SISTER.

AND AS SISTERS
WE HAVE AN INTRINSIC
DUTY TO UPHOLD PEACE.

19:20.005 --> 19:23.027
NOT ONLY FOR THE CITY
OF TOWNSVILLE BUT
AMONGST OURSELVES.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.024
UGH. WHY DID I HAVE
TO OPEN MY BIG TRAP?

19:26.026 --> 19:28.015

20:40.024 --> 20:42.024
WE CAN RULE THE WORLD.

20:42.026 --> 20:45.004
JUST YOU AND ME, BUBBLES.

20:45.006 --> 20:46.009
I'M NOT BUBBLES.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.027
BUBBLES IS NOT MY NAME,
FOR THE NAME "BUBBLES"

20:48.029 --> 20:51.021
IS NOT THE CORRECT
NAME TO ADDRESS ME BY

20:51.023 --> 20:53.011
BECAUSE IT IS
NOT MY NAME.

20:53.013 --> 20:58.006
IF YOU WERE TO ADDRESS ME
BY THE NAME "MOJO JOJO,"
THAT WOULD BE CORRECT,

20:58.008 --> 21:00.004
FOR MY NAME IS MOJO JOJO.

21:00.006 --> 21:04.021
AND I WILL ONLY BE
ADDRESSED BY THAT NAME,
WHICH IS MOJO JOJO.

21:04.023 --> 21:08.003
AND FURTHERMORE,
IT IS NOT <i>WE</i><i>WHO</i>
WILL RULE THE WORLD,

21:08.005 --> 21:12.024
IT IS <i>I,</i>
I BEING MOJO JOJO,
WHO IS NOT BUBBLES,

21:12.026 --> 21:14.009
SHALL RULE
THIS WORLD ALONE,

21:14.011 --> 21:16.004
WHICH IS TO SAY WITHOUT
ANYBODY ELSE,

21:16.006 --> 21:18.012
AND WITHOUT ANYBODY ELSE
SHALL I RULE THIS WORLD.

21:18.014 --> 21:23.028
AND, WHEN THIS WORLD IS
RULED BY ONLY ONE PERSON, IT
IS NOT A COLLECTIVE GROUP,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.009
THAT ONE PERSON WHO
SHALL BE RULING THE WORLD

21:26.011 --> 21:32.012
WILL BE NOT OTHER THAN
ME, MOJO JOJO. [LAUGHS]

21:32.014 --> 21:35.001
OH, SHUT UP.

21:47.023 --> 21:50.022
THAT'S ALL JUST WELL
ENOUGH BECAUSE IN REALITY,

21:50.024 --> 21:54.012
THERE'S ONLY ROOM ENOUGH IN
THIS WORLD FOR ONE MOJO JOJO.

21:54.014 --> 21:56.021
ONE SHALL BE THE NUMBER OF
MOJO JOJOS IN THE WORLD

21:56.023 --> 21:59.020
AND THE NUMBER OF MOJO JOJOS
IN THE WORLD SHALL BE ONE.

21:59.022 --> 22:02.011
TWO MOJO JOJOS IS TOO MANY
AND 3 IS RIGHT OUT.

22:02.013 --> 22:06.023
SO THE ONLY MOJO JOJO
THERE IS ROOM FOR IN
THE WORLD SHALL BE ME.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.017
AND BEING THE ONLY
MOJO JOJO IN THE WORLD,

22:08.019 --> 22:16.018

ONE MOJO JOJO! [LAUGHS]

SWEET OLD SELF AGAIN.

22:49.009 --> 22:52.008
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE
THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T
ENOUGH ROOM

22:52.010 --> 22:54.014
IN THE WORLD FOR
