08:12.837 --> 08:16.037
          You know, a couple of 
          people came to my     
          office this morning,  

08:17.807 --> 08:19.173
          and I hate to say it, 

08:19.175 --> 08:20.941
             and I'm not gonna  
             put you on blast,  

08:24.513 --> 08:27.480
      but I got the faint smell 
      of Stoli Cranberry.       
      Hallelujah.

           PASTOR JONES:        
           And, my God          

08:32.419 --> 08:34.652
       instills a moral compass 
       within all of us.        

08:34.654 --> 08:35.419
      MAN: Yes!                 
              ALL: Yes.

         and what is wrong.     

08:44.762 --> 08:47.696
             And I don't know   
             if some of y'all   
             need a tune-up,    

08:47.698 --> 08:48.830
       but your compass is off. 

08:48.832 --> 08:50.097
            Yes!                

08:51.733 --> 08:52.898
           The gauge is broken. 

08:54.801 --> 08:58.069
            You need to pay     
            a mechanic a visit. 

08:59.305 --> 09:00.671
          Get your gauge right.

         So today,              
         this morning, beloved, 

09:23.855 --> 09:28.624
        I wanna really instill  
        on you a very,          
        very important message. 

09:29.193 --> 09:30.192
           MAN: Preach. Preach. 

09:32.329 --> 09:35.063
           And that message is, 
           that you will        
           reap what you sow.   

09:35.732 --> 09:36.997
          Wake up.

                  Praise Jesus. 

09:41.703 --> 09:44.336
            I cannot judge you, 

09:44.338 --> 09:45.837
      but the ultimate judge... 

09:45.839 --> 09:46.904
  MAN: Is God.                  

09:46.906 --> 09:48.071
               ...is God.       

09:48.073 --> 09:49.172
   MAN: Yes, sir.               

09:50.608 --> 09:51.807
    That was a great            
    sermon, Pastor.

          Thank you.            
          Thank you for coming.

                     Thank you. 

10:07.920 --> 10:09.653
 I was moved.                   

10:09.655 --> 10:13.723
 I really felt                  
 like you was talking           
 to me and my boys today.       

10:13.725 --> 10:15.057
                 God bless you. 
       Sister Katherine!

       Sister Katherine,        

10:19.995 --> 10:21.928
      I need to speak with you  

10:21.930 --> 10:23.896
         about the women's      
         fellowship dinner      
         on next Tuesday.       

10:23.898 --> 10:25.797
 Oh, sure.                      
 Okay. Yeah. Yes.

10:30.902 --> 10:33.068
             And I'll see       
             you two young boys

 KATHERINE: That's right.       

10:36.171 --> 10:38.037
       Now, Sister Katherine?   
      Yes.                      

10:38.039 --> 10:39.972
          I heard through       
          the grapevine that    
          you are the one       

10:39.974 --> 10:41.740
     providing the baked goods. 
   Oh, yes.                     

10:41.742 --> 10:43.174
             Now, is that true? 
  That's true.                  

10:43.176 --> 10:44.742
               Because we are   
               countin' on you.

            gotten so big.      

10:57.086 --> 10:59.052
 Yes, he has.                   

10:59.054 --> 11:00.720
 Well, if only I                
 was a little younger.          

11:00.722 --> 11:01.954
                 A lot younger. 

11:01.956 --> 11:03.689
 Mind your manners.             

11:03.691 --> 11:08.326
 That's okay.                   
 That's just boys being boys.   

11:08.328 --> 11:10.861
 Well, anyway, I will see you

            That should be      
            a crime, man.       

11:24.807 --> 11:26.206
        You know she used       
        to change your diapers. 

11:26.208 --> 11:28.741
       No, she didn't.          
       Did she, Ma?             

11:28.743 --> 11:30.142
 Yeah, baby.

       Long.                    

13:18.273 --> 13:19.805
 Got paid, though.              

13:22.142 --> 13:23.040
     That's good.               

13:26.412 --> 13:28.979
      It's gonna be             
      tight around here         
      for the next few months.  

13:28.981 --> 13:30.413
   My damn schedule's been cut. 

13:30.415 --> 13:32.181
    On both jobs?               
                     Mmm-hmm.   

13:34.185 --> 13:36.451
     That's why I asked         
     your lazy ass brother      
     to get a job and pitch in. 

13:38.121 --> 13:38.919
     I'm not playin' with him.  
     He better get a job.       

13:43.825 --> 13:45.491
 Well, until he does,           
 I can get a second job.

15:10.598 --> 15:11.964
 What does that mean?           

15:11.966 --> 15:14.199
             It means there's   
             nothing I can do.

     Listen, miss,              
     I'm a college student,     
     that's all I have.         

15:20.872 --> 15:23.105
 I cannot let my                
 mom's lights be cut off.       

15:25.909 --> 15:29.143
               I'm willing to   
               take the $337.15 

15:29.145 --> 15:31.611
              if you promise    
              that you will not 
              miss one payment. 

15:35.083 --> 15:37.183
 Yeah, I promise. I won't.

15:38.553 --> 15:40.352
               One payment,     
               and lights out.

           like to dance, too.

        never think of...

     I shouldn't have           
     left the club early.       

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:47.133
       It's all right, honey.   
       It's not all your fault. 

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.512
                       Hey!     

01:05:01.214 --> 01:05:02.146
                     You okay?  

01:05:03.415 --> 01:05:04.213
       The prettiest            
       nurse I've ever seen.

                (CHUCKLES)      

01:05:07.383 --> 01:05:10.016
  Come on. Don't be scared.     
  I'm feeling better.           

01:05:10.018 --> 01:05:13.119
 It's just a little bruising.   
 Doctor said I can leave soon.  

01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:15.054
          Why didn't you        
          tell me you were      
          going out last night? 

01:05:16.924 --> 01:05:19.624
 It was a last minute thing.    
 Just for work.                 

01:05:21.027 --> 01:05:21.859
                      Work?     
 Mmm-hmm.                       

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.460
          Chris told me you     
          guys were at the club 

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.028
            and this happened   
            in the parking lot. 

01:05:27.898 --> 01:05:30.965
     Yeah, that's right,        
     that's what happened.      

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:33.634
 I got out of work              
 and then I met Chris           
 at the club and this happened. 

01:05:36.005 --> 01:05:37.371
              You need to rest  
              and stop working  
              yourself so hard. 

01:05:39.141 --> 01:05:40.607
 Yeah, you're probably right.   

01:05:43.278 --> 01:05:44.543
            Thank God           
            you're okay though. 

01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:49.915
           I'll call you later? 

01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:51.049
          Yeah, okay.           

01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:52.250
                 All right.     

01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:55.119
 Hey, Carmen.                   
              Yeah, babe?       

01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:00.990
             Nothing.           

01:06:02.326 --> 01:06:03.291

01:06:57.074 --> 01:06:58.673
             Yeah, man, I just  
             want to thank you  
             for helping me out 

01:06:58.675 --> 01:07:01.176
           with all the medical 
           bills and stuff.     

01:07:01.177 --> 01:07:03.678
 Don't even trip.               
 You made that back             
 for us like 20 times over.     

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.446

 it ain't been                  
 the same without you.

 been complaining.

 So when you coming back?

01:07:10.218 --> 01:07:12.218
    Yeah, I'm low on cash, man, 
    just bought a new car.      

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.119

 in business then.

              my locker, right? 

01:07:15.355 --> 01:07:16.354
 No, it's just

    What're you talking about?  

01:18:08.819 --> 01:18:09.851
            This is crazy, man. 

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.286
       I'm losing everything    
       that's important to me   

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:13.287
          'cause of this place. 

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.122
           I just came for      
           the extra cash, man.

             This place         
             is out of control.

           Hey, Ma.             

01:18:53.359 --> 01:18:54.291
        Hey, son.               

01:18:55.427 --> 01:18:56.793

01:19:00.197 --> 01:19:02.263

  some hot chocolate            

01:19:02.265 --> 01:19:03.931
 and clip some coupons.         

01:19:04.767 --> 01:19:05.932
 You want some?                 

01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:08.667
            No, I'm good.       
        Okay.                   

01:19:11.838 --> 01:19:14.071
       Hey, Ma, I got something 
       I got to tell you.       

01:19:19.278 --> 01:19:21.144
      I haven't been            
      entirely honest with you. 

01:19:22.847 --> 01:19:24.813
          I haven't been        
          entirely honest with  

01:19:24.815 --> 01:19:26.281
          a lot of people about 
          what I've been doing. 

01:19:30.453 --> 01:19:31.919
         Ma, I've been dancing. 

01:19:33.689 --> 01:19:34.854
        Dancing?                

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:36.789
              Stripping.        

01:19:39.059 --> 01:19:42.060
      I'm a male exotic dancer. 

01:19:42.062 --> 01:19:44.762
 And I work at                  
 the Chocolate City Strip Club. 

01:19:44.764 --> 01:19:45.963
     And I just so happen to be 

01:19:45.965 --> 01:19:47.964
          one of the featured   
          dancers there.        

01:19:50.868 --> 01:19:53.468
          Okay...               

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:54.802
      That's where all the cash 
      has been coming from.     

01:19:55.738 --> 01:19:56.837
       And Chris is my manager. 

01:20:01.977 --> 01:20:04.444
    Do you have sex             
    with these women?           

01:20:04.446 --> 01:20:06.879
    No, it's nothing like that. 
    It's just dancing.          

01:20:06.881 --> 01:20:08.714
    And it's not entirely nude. 

01:20:10.217 --> 01:20:11.482
     Thank you, God.

01:20:22.392 --> 01:20:23.357
            What's so funny?    

01:20:24.059 --> 01:20:25.725
     Exotic dancer?

        (LAUGHS)                

01:20:29.062 --> 01:20:31.428
  You are a cutie pie,          
  that's for sure.              

01:20:34.399 --> 01:20:35.765
           So you're not mad?   

01:20:36.734 --> 01:20:38.967
 No, son, I am not mad.         

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.504
 If dancing is what you like    
 or what you wanna do,          

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.939
 I can't tell you               
 you're wrong for that.         

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.008
  That's a decision             

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.976
 that you are ultimately        
 gonna have to live with.       

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.879
        Yeah, first I was just  
        doing it for the money. 

01:20:54.881 --> 01:20:56.180
 Mmm-hmm.                       

01:20:56.182 --> 01:20:59.349
       And then, it became fun. 

01:20:59.351 --> 01:21:01.117
      But it's not fun anymore. 

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.253
 It hurt your girlfriend,       
 didn't it?                     

01:21:06.523 --> 01:21:08.155
               Yeah, it did.    

01:21:08.157 --> 01:21:09.122
        And then I lied to her. 

01:21:09.858 --> 01:21:10.857
  Well...                       

01:21:12.861 --> 01:21:14.861
     It's none of               
     my business, but,          

01:21:17.298 --> 01:21:19.064
   she seems like               
   a really nice girl.          

01:21:20.934 --> 01:21:23.634
 And you should do everything   
 in your power to win her back. 

01:21:25.971 --> 01:21:26.869
 Everything.                    

01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:29.604
                Hey, Ma.        

01:21:30.573 --> 01:21:31.638
        Yes, son.               

01:21:33.074 --> 01:21:34.206
                  I love you.   

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.512
   I love you more.             

01:21:52.256 --> 01:21:53.388
 Thanks for the talk, girl.     

01:21:54.124 --> 01:21:55.189
          You're sure you okay? 

01:21:56.292 --> 01:21:57.257
            Yeah.               

01:21:57.592 --> 01:21:59.058
           I'm cool.            

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.225
  I'll talk to you later?       

01:22:00.227 --> 01:22:01.526
                   Okay.        
           All right.           

01:22:19.445 --> 01:22:20.911
        Carmen! Carmen!         

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.446
       Leave me alone, Michael. 

01:22:23.448 --> 01:22:25.314
        Carmen, wait.           
             What?              

01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:26.415
         I need to talk to you. 

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:27.682
          What?                 

01:22:29.686 --> 01:22:32.687
         Look, Carmen,          
         I know you're probably 
         upset with me.         

01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:34.555
         And I know that        
         should've came to you. 

01:22:35.991 --> 01:22:37.357
             I didn't know how. 

01:22:37.359 --> 01:22:39.325
 So you lie to me instead?      

01:22:40.594 --> 01:22:42.293
 Is it that serious, Michael?   

01:22:42.295 --> 01:22:44.028
        Look, I didn't mean to. 

01:22:45.431 --> 01:22:46.696
           I just didn't know   
           how you would react. 

01:22:47.598 --> 01:22:49.130
        I mean, think about it. 

01:22:49.132 --> 01:22:50.931
          "Hey, baby,           
          I'm a male stripper." 

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:52.599
       "And by the way,         
       how about those Lakers." 

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:54.567
 Well, of course                
 I would disapprove.            

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:56.435
 You're my boyfriend.           

01:22:56.437 --> 01:22:58.336
 I don't want other women       
 looking at your body,          

01:22:58.338 --> 01:23:00.604
 groping and trying             
 to grab your crotch.           

01:23:00.606 --> 01:23:02.339
           Why?                 

01:23:02.341 --> 01:23:04.407
 Why would you become           
 a male stripper?               

01:23:04.409 --> 01:23:05.441
      Because they were gonna   
      turn my mom's lights out. 

01:23:05.443 --> 01:23:06.675
            I needed the money. 

01:23:11.281 --> 01:23:13.447
       It was fast and, I mean, 

01:23:13.449 --> 01:23:15.148
          it was the only thing 
          I could think of.     

01:23:17.385 --> 01:23:20.319
 I wish you would've told me    
 that you needed some help.     

01:23:20.321 --> 01:23:21.653
                 Look, baby,    
                 I'm the man.   

01:23:21.655 --> 01:23:23.087
       Okay, it's not my style. 

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:27.290
            I'm supposed to     
            be buying you gifts 
            and spoiling you    

01:23:28.493 --> 01:23:30.192
               and treating you 
               like a princess. 

01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:31.359
      Not the other way around. 

01:23:35.098 --> 01:23:36.597
 You're always the charmer,     
 Michael.                       

01:23:37.733 --> 01:23:39.332
         Look, I'm sorry, babe. 

01:23:41.469 --> 01:23:43.969
       And besides,             
       tonight's my last night. 

01:23:43.971 --> 01:23:46.004
       'Cause I quit.           
       I knew you'd want me to. 

01:23:48.108 --> 01:23:50.708
               And honestly,    
               nothing is worth 
               losing you.      

01:23:53.345 --> 01:23:54.577
   No more lies.                

01:23:55.479 --> 01:23:56.644
                  I promise.    

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.046
      My dancing days are over. 

01:24:02.116 --> 01:24:05.183
 Except, when you do it         
 for me in private, right?      

01:24:05.685 --> 01:24:06.650
                     Hmm?       

01:24:09.187 --> 01:24:10.586
 Wanna come inside?             

01:24:11.522 --> 01:24:12.754
                   Bad girl.    

01:24:16.192 --> 01:24:17.457
  (SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC)        

01:25:11.178 --> 01:25:13.244
   Michael, couple of people    
   are asking for you in front. 

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.479
     For me?                    

01:25:15.481 --> 01:25:16.213
              You're Michael,   
              aren't you?       

01:25:26.357 --> 01:25:28.457
    Oh, my God.                 
    It's Sexy Chocolate.        

01:25:28.459 --> 01:25:29.558
             Can we have        
             your autograph?    

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.425
         Can you sign           
         my breast?             

01:25:31.561 --> 01:25:33.661
           All right,           
           here you go, ladies. 

01:25:33.663 --> 01:25:35.162
 Can you sign this?             
                   Yeah.        

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:38.064
                 Yo, Mike, man! 

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.298
         What, you don't answer 
         the phone no more?     

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.565
             Chris, what're you 
             doing here?        

01:25:40.567 --> 01:25:43.134
       I came for the delicious 
       grade C menu.            

01:25:43.136 --> 01:25:45.102
              That's my brother 
              right here.       
 I came to talk to you.         

01:25:45.104 --> 01:25:46.236
                 Hi.            
 Hello, ladies,                 
 how're you doing?              

01:25:46.238 --> 01:25:47.604
 Can I talk to my               
 brother for a minute?          

01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:48.738
 Come here.                     
          MICHAEL: What is up?  

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.172
              CHRIS: So listen. 

01:25:50.174 --> 01:25:51.673
    Apparently, one of the days 

01:25:51.675 --> 01:25:53.541
 that you were up there         
 doing your thing,              

01:25:53.543 --> 01:25:55.175
 you caught the attention       
 of a beautiful young lady.     

01:25:55.177 --> 01:25:57.243
 She wants to fly you out       
 for a private gig.             

01:25:57.245 --> 01:25:59.445
         No, no, no.            
         I'm cool, man, listen. 

01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:01.713
         I got an A on my test. 

01:26:01.715 --> 01:26:03.681
            I got my girl back. 
            I'm happy, man.     

01:26:03.683 --> 01:26:05.749
 Congratulations!               
 That'll mean nothing...        

01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:07.784
               Hey, let's break 
               this parade up.  

01:26:07.786 --> 01:26:11.854
  If you wanna continue working 
  in this establishment, I...   

01:26:11.856 --> 01:26:14.556
      You know,                 
      you better bring your ass 
      back in this kitchen.     

01:26:16.459 --> 01:26:18.792
       Yes, sir.                
       Listen, bro, I gotta go. 

01:26:18.794 --> 01:26:20.560
 No, what you gotta do is       

01:26:20.561 --> 01:26:22.327
 get on this plane              
 and go to Japan                
 and make this $100,000
