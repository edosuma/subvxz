WEBVTT

00:09.242 --> 00:10.242
Did you give
that to her?

00:10.244 --> 00:11.710
Hands behind
your back, please.

00:11.712 --> 00:12.511
Bird, tell them.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.246
I'm here to
pick up Carter--
No, Liz.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.582
Crash came by.
Some idiot clerk

00:16.584 --> 00:18.517
allowed him to post
bail for her.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.785
She left with him?

00:19.787 --> 00:20.619
Whoo!

00:20.621 --> 00:21.687
So where are we going?

00:21.689 --> 00:22.821
Where do you
wanna go?

00:22.823 --> 00:24.823
Somewhere where
nobody knows me.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.758
(phone beeping)

00:25.760 --> 00:27.226
Oh, my God.
What?

00:27.228 --> 00:29.795
Elizabeth put out
an AMBER Alert?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.230
Dammit.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.364
I wish everyone
in the world

00:32.366 --> 00:33.532
wasn't looking
for us right now.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.334
Wait, everybody is
looking for us.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.202
My mom would have seen
the AMBER Alert.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.340
We need to go leave a
message for her with Max.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.409
Why did you buy that?

00:43.411 --> 00:44.843
Oh, yeah.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.379
I knew you'd
come back.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.481
Will you give that
to her if you see her?

00:49.483 --> 00:51.183
(Crash)
Max, you wanna
help us, right?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.886
Well, I mean, I know
you wanna help Carter.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.854
Give us everything
in your register.

00:55.856 --> 00:56.889
Report it as a robbery.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.557
Crash, what the hell
are you doing?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.359
The safety's on, see?

01:00.361 --> 01:01.593
(gunshot)

01:01.595 --> 01:02.861
Call 9-1-1!

01:02.863 --> 01:04.530
Max, my God.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.764
Oh, God.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.499
(Carter)
Help me.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.134
What were you doing
with a gun?

01:09.136 --> 01:10.369
(Taylor)
I don't know what's worse,

01:10.371 --> 01:12.838
you being abducted or
you coming back here.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.174
No, I will never
forgive you.

01:15.176 --> 01:19.378
Girls, the doctor
has asked to see us.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.984
do we
have covering that?

01:27.353 --> 01:28.420
Is he all right?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.922
When can he come home?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.056
How did it go?

01:31.058 --> 01:32.357
He came through
the surgery.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.960
He's very fortunate that the
wound was a through and through.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.929
It could've been
much worse.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.263
Well, can we see him
at least?

01:38.265 --> 01:41.934
Currently Max is
non-responsive.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.802
Nonre-- what does
that mean?

01:43.804 --> 01:44.903
Is that a coma?

01:44.905 --> 01:45.704
Hopefully.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.705
Hopefully,
it's a coma?

01:46.707 --> 01:48.407
If it's a coma,
he can wake up.

01:48.409 --> 01:52.311
When someone's just
non-responsive...

01:52.313 --> 01:54.413
At this point,
we're in a waiting game.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.782
The best thing you can
all do is just go home

01:56.784 --> 01:57.683
and get some rest.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.051
My staff and I will be
in touch with you.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.886
Oh, but please,
please.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.222
Look, surely, he's more
likely to wake up

02:03.224 --> 02:05.991
if he hears
voices he recognizes.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.494
Please, can we see him?

02:10.063 --> 02:11.029
All right, fine.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.799
One person
for one minute.

02:15.835 --> 02:18.137
Carter!

02:22.942 --> 02:25.177
(door closing)

02:26.980 --> 02:29.815
(woman over P.A.)
<i>Radiology, line four.</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:33.152
<i>Radiology, line four.</i>

02:39.792 --> 02:42.327
(monitor beeping)

02:55.341 --> 02:57.009
Max.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.180
Max, it's me.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.354
I'm so sorry.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.357
I am so sorry.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.098
I'm gonna make
things right.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.401
I promise.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.037
But Max, you have
to wake up.

03:27.907 --> 03:32.144
You have to wake up
for me to do that.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.722

I know you've got much bigger
things on your mind, but...

05:30.464 --> 05:33.832
this stuff
with Max...

05:33.834 --> 05:36.101
Life is short.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.306
I'm gonna do
everything I can

05:41.308 --> 05:43.208
to make it right

05:43.210 --> 05:44.810
(door opening)

05:44.812 --> 05:46.712
Hey.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.380
Hi.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.350
Figured you'd be
needing that.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.756
Same number.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.791
Thank you.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.828
You're dressed up.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.162
Job interview.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.163
What kind of
interview?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.999
Teaching literature
and essay writing

06:08.001 --> 06:12.137
to tenth graders at the
McAllister Holt Academy.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.772
You already have a job,
you're a writer.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.241
This might be better,
don't you think?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.343
Than being a writer?

06:18.345 --> 06:19.411
No.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.912
I know it comes
at a terrible time.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.248
I can easily cancel if
you think I should.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.885
No, no, I don't want you
to miss out on this.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.020
Wish me luck.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.391
David?

06:32.393 --> 06:34.860
Good luck.

06:36.763 --> 06:40.232
See you, bud.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.867
Hey.
Hi.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.634
Where you going?

06:42.636 --> 06:45.937
I'm going to stay at the
hospital until Max wakes up.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.039
I wanna be the first
person he sees

06:48.041 --> 06:49.241
when he opens his eyes.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.777
Taylor, I'm sorry
about earlier.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.944
I just didn't think.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.413
But, honestly, there is
no way in hell

06:54.415 --> 06:56.047
he even knew
I was in the room.

06:56.049 --> 06:56.915
Yeah, but I did.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.918
I know you love Max,
but he is also my best

06:59.920 --> 07:02.120
and oldest friend in
the entire world.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.722
If you care about
Max so much,

07:03.724 --> 07:05.023
why don't you devote
your time to finding

07:05.025 --> 07:07.993
your fugitive boyfriend
and getting him arrested?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.261
This is giving
me a headache.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.963
Okay, all right,
the last thing that we need

07:11.965 --> 07:14.065
is the two of you going
at each other.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.300
Don't worry,
I'm leaving.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.670
Carter can find someone
else to fight with.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.440
She always does.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.676
(door opening
and closing)

07:24.678 --> 07:26.845
Look...

07:26.847 --> 07:30.382
There is something else
that I need to tell you.

07:30.384 --> 07:31.416
What?

07:31.418 --> 07:33.618
This morning, I went
down to the station,

07:33.620 --> 07:35.353
I talked to my captain.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.221
Okay.

07:36.223 --> 07:42.027
I am part of the team that is
assigned to apprehend Crash.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.798
Now if Max dies...

07:46.800 --> 07:47.666
Oh, my God, please--

07:47.668 --> 07:51.803
If Max dies,
that's felony murder.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.805
He didn't mean
to shoot him.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.840
I told you,
he thought

07:54.842 --> 07:56.408
the safety was on,
it was an accident.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.377
I saw the footage from
the security camera.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.647
And he pointed
his gun at Max.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.250
And did you
watch after?

08:05.252 --> 08:08.653
Crash lost his mind
after that.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.287
Yes, I saw that.

08:09.289 --> 08:12.657
And then I saw
him run away.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.725
Yeah.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.660
That's 'cause he thought
he'd go to prison.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.296
Which is where
he should be.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.165
Carter.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.033
Look at me.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.671
He left you alone

08:26.673 --> 08:29.975
with your best friend
dying in your arms.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.615
(knocking)

08:36.617 --> 08:38.016
I'm busy.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.418
(Bird)
Carter?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.859
What are you doing here?

08:47.861 --> 08:51.696
Crash has been
calling me non-stop.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.131
He wants to see you.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.068
(phone buzzing)

08:57.070 --> 08:59.971
It's him.

09:07.747 --> 09:12.050
(Carter)
Hey, Bird, are you there,
have you talked to her?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.818
Crash?
Hey.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.420
It's so good to
hear your voice.

09:15.422 --> 09:19.024
Don't call me on
Bird's phone again.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.359
I didn't know how else
to reach you.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.229
I have my
old phone back.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.830
Where are you?

09:25.832 --> 09:26.431
Still here.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.801
I didn't mean to shoot Max,
you know that, I--

09:29.803 --> 09:31.970
It was an accident.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.538
Crash.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.107
You just left me there.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.443
I know, I freaked out,
I didn't know what to do.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.444
I didn't know where to go.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.047
You didn't know you should
stay and help me?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.281
<i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>

09:43.283 --> 09:45.417
I'm sorry.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.353
Max is in a coma,
Crash.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.295
Will you see me?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.833
No.

10:05.738 --> 10:09.274
I don't know.

10:09.276 --> 10:14.045
Crash, you have to
turn yourself in.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.347
(sniffling)
I can't.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.115
Yes, you can
and then you can--

10:17.117 --> 10:20.218
you can explain your
side of the story.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.252
Crash, if they
catch you first,

10:21.254 --> 10:23.421
it's not gonna matter if
it was an accident or not.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.024
<i>No, it's not gonna</i>
<i>matter anyway.</i>

10:26.026 --> 10:28.059
I have to go.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.227
I'm gonna leave tonight.

10:29.229 --> 10:32.797
But, promise me you'll
see me before I go.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.901
I can't Crash,
I have to go.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.403
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.306
<i>Carter, please,</i>
<i>just meet me.</i>

10:46.479 --> 10:49.247
Here, you can go now.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.215
Carter, I'm here.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.083
I know you're upset
about Max.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.120
I'm just trying
to be your friend.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.123
Come on, Bird, I think we
both know you're not that.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.759
If you could just
let me explain myself--

11:00.761 --> 11:01.326
Explain what?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.427
You don't understand
what it was like--

11:02.429 --> 11:07.098
Bird, you didn't wanna get
in trouble with your parents

11:07.100 --> 11:08.366
so you had me sent to jail.

11:08.368 --> 11:12.103
It's a lot more
complicated than that.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.073
Not to me, Bird.

Where's Carter?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.303
She's not here because
the doctor said

12:52.305 --> 12:54.005
only one of us could...

12:54.007 --> 12:57.208
be in the room
at a time.

her boyfriend shot him?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.328
Why, I--

13:18.464 --> 13:21.166
(Elizabeth)
We tried the trailer park,
he wasn't there.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.735
So he's not with
his usual associates

13:23.737 --> 13:25.103
and we know from the
Highway Patrol

13:25.105 --> 13:26.204
that he hasn't
left the state.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.340
Yeah, what other place
would matter to him?

13:29.342 --> 13:33.278
What about the place where
his little brother died?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.979
The Weldon warehouse.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.415
Truck exploded and he
was held responsible

13:37.417 --> 13:40.351
even though he wasn't.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.153
Where is this
Weldon warehouse?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.290
It's about, uh,
a half-hour maybe.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.057
Okay, I'm there.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.926
You know what, I'm gonna
check the chop shops.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.993
Maybe he traded
his car in.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.762

in love?

What are you
talking about?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.274

Karen loves you.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.242

15:44.244 --> 15:46.945

fault that Max got shot,

15:46.947 --> 15:48.046
but everyone
knows it was.

was an accident.

you're saying he had
a heart attack?

It's what's known as
a cardiac tamponade.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.093
Blood began pooling
in the pericardium--

22:42.095 --> 22:43.160
it's a sac around
his heart--

22:43.162 --> 22:44.495
putting pressure on it
so that it couldn't pump.

22:44.497 --> 22:47.832

and his body went into shock.

a window in the sac

22:49.936 --> 22:50.534

22:50.536 --> 22:53.471
So his heart is
functioning normally now.

It's functioning
normally, yes.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.910
how did that
job interview go?

24:05.912 --> 24:08.946
Oh, I forgot, too.
I got it.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.147
You got it?
Yes.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.183
Fantastic.
congratulations!

24:12.185 --> 24:13.250
Thank you.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.018
Where?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.120
McAllister Holt Academy.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.354
(Ofe)
Really?

24:17.356 --> 24:20.357
I used to go there,
once upon a time.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.459
It's a great school.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.060
I was-- I was
kicked out,

24:23.062 --> 24:28.532
uh, for a minor infraction
I don't do no more.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.837
Anyway...
That's great, Dad,

24:32.839 --> 24:34.138
I'm happy for you.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.906
Thank you,
sweetie.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.376
Congratulations.

24:41.112 --> 24:43.047
Thank you.

24:54.359 --> 24:56.861
You know, Karen, um...

24:56.863 --> 24:59.930
Taylor's been taking
care of Max's plants

24:59.932 --> 25:01.966
all this time.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.169
Thank you.

25:06.137 --> 25:07.805
He loves
his plants.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.474
The blooms came in
on his hibiscus.

25:10.476 --> 25:12.209
He's gonna
be so excited.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.812
Well, that boy
is never happier

25:14.814 --> 25:16.247
than when he has
some dirt

25:16.249 --> 25:18.015
and a new
package of seeds.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.984
Except when he's
making croutons.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.952
He makes croutons?
Mm-hmm,

25:21.954 --> 25:22.953
Taylor taught him.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.488
He's really
good at it.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.422
Oh, my gosh.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.992
Well, if you
aren't the sweetest.

25:27.994 --> 25:32.296
She is, Karen.
She's the sweetest.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.064
Max really loves her.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.101
Well, I can
certainly see why.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.137
He's so kind
and soulful.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.373
And those are two words
that I don't use much.

25:42.375 --> 25:47.111
Basically, it's impossible
not to like the guy.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.346
(Ofe)
He's great.
He's at the top of my

25:49.348 --> 25:51.515
"if I could be anybody
in the world" list.

25:51.517 --> 25:54.818
Like, above Beyonce.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.520
Oh.
(laughing)

25:58.356 --> 26:01.258
Yeah, he-- he's like
a brother to me.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.162
Well, he always
wanted a brother, so...

26:05.164 --> 26:10.200
I was-- I was
just too young.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.804
We could tell you about all
the funny and great things

26:13.806 --> 26:15.973
Max has done
since he's been here.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.441
Like--
Laundry?

26:17.443 --> 26:19.910
Yeah.
Yes.

26:19.912 --> 26:20.711
You let him
do laundry?

26:20.713 --> 26:24.148
Okay, you guys know all
the shirts that he wears

26:24.150 --> 26:25.149
that are the same color?

26:25.151 --> 26:28.052
They did not
start out that way.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.054
That's why I'm
wearing black.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.089
(laughter)

26:47.138 --> 26:50.374
(sighing)
You can't avoid me forever.

26:58.249 --> 27:00.117
Fine.

27:01.786 --> 27:06.323
I don't know if you're
gonna understand this, but...

27:06.325 --> 27:11.362
I'm terrified
of my parents.

27:11.364 --> 27:14.932
Elizabeth isn't exactly
a walk in the park.

27:14.934 --> 27:18.802
But at least you know
she loves you.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.772
I don't even know
if my mom likes me.

27:21.774 --> 27:25.242
And my dad is definitely
not interested.

27:25.244 --> 27:30.047
I know, who doesn't have
self-esteem issues, right?

27:30.049 --> 27:32.783
Well, besides you.

27:32.785 --> 27:36.153
Um, I have
self-esteem issues.

27:36.155 --> 27:40.824
Well, if you do, they're
practically invisible because...

27:40.826 --> 27:43.761
you're the girl who
everybody wants to know,

27:43.763 --> 27:47.831
and who everybody
wants to be with.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.801
I made a mistake.

27:50.803 --> 27:55.205
A really, really
vicious mistake.

27:56.107 --> 27:58.242
And now, my parents
are making whispers

27:58.244 --> 28:01.412
about boarding school.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.414
(sighing)

28:03.416 --> 28:07.084
I'm sorry
to hear that.

28:08.119 --> 28:10.187
Well...

28:10.189 --> 28:14.358
you gotta pay for
your mistakes, right?

28:17.095 --> 28:19.263
Are you still in
touch with him?

28:22.300 --> 28:25.202
Carter, I don't know if
you're ever gonna forgive me,

28:25.204 --> 28:30.441
but I'm just trying to be
a real friend for you now.
