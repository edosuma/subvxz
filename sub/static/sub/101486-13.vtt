00:06.882 --> 00:08.090
(marching band playing)

00:09.385 --> 00:11.068
Happy Parade Day!

00:11.128 --> 00:14.238
It's the Parade Day Parade!

00:14.298 --> 00:15.589
(horns honking)

00:15.725 --> 00:17.499
Clear the roadway!

00:17.518 --> 00:20.519
Your antics
inconvenience hundreds!

00:21.731 --> 00:23.355
Hooray for parades!

00:23.548 --> 00:25.858
Your antics delight one and all!

00:26.977 --> 00:30.029
Follow me, Little Lord Ralph!

00:31.982 --> 00:34.349
What's hiding
behind the Great Green Wall?

00:34.452 --> 00:35.850
A choo choo? Some buttons?

00:35.953 --> 00:37.852
A dog ten feet tall?

00:37.955 --> 00:40.539
♪ ♪

00:41.584 --> 00:42.624
Hmm-hmm.

00:45.695 --> 00:49.531
(gasps)
My eyes told me a secret!

00:49.550 --> 00:50.716
(school bell rings)

00:50.885 --> 00:53.260
Aw, last day of school.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.221
Lot of fond memories in here.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.540
-Furnace.
-On it.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.874
I know
what's behind the Big Hedge,

00:59.935 --> 01:01.209
because I went behind
the Big Hedge

01:01.270 --> 01:02.710
and I saw what's behind
the Big Hedge

01:02.772 --> 01:04.955
and now I'm gonna tell you. Yay!

01:05.015 --> 01:07.232
The Big Hedge?
As in<i> the</i> Big Hedge?

01:07.425 --> 01:09.717
No one knows
what's behind that thing.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.071
Although,
a seventh grader once told me

01:12.264 --> 01:14.464
it was naked ladies
setting off fireworks.

01:14.483 --> 01:17.801
I heard it's where divorced
parents go to get back together.

01:17.903 --> 01:21.896
No, sir! It's where they hold
the Independent Spirit Awards!

01:21.957 --> 01:24.583
If you call<i> that</i> independent.

01:24.776 --> 01:28.087
No, it's
the best playground ever!

01:28.280 --> 01:31.757
There's Easter eggs and
baby cars that anyone can drive.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.426
And this many clowns
in clown pants!

01:34.619 --> 01:37.805
(chuckles)
Dang, that's hella clowns.

01:39.341 --> 01:40.933
-(raccoon chitters)
-How the crotch

01:41.126 --> 01:42.917
do we get through<i> that</i> thing?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.686
I've seen my dad do this.

01:50.394 --> 01:52.336
(birds chirping)

01:52.396 --> 01:54.279
-Wow!
-OTHERS: Whoa!

01:55.950 --> 01:59.618
See? Easter eggs,
clown pants and baby cars.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.179
I love you, clowns!

02:03.290 --> 02:06.041
There's a golf course
in the middle of Springfield?

02:07.044 --> 02:08.518
NELSON:
What's golf?

02:08.579 --> 02:10.871
I've never seen a golf course
anywhere,

02:10.965 --> 02:12.856
except those commercials
for pills

02:12.916 --> 02:14.949
that give old people
their life back.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.376
-Duckies!
-(ducks quacking)

02:16.470 --> 02:18.879
I'm gonna go steal
their wet bread.

02:18.973 --> 02:22.790
Whoa, I've never seen
Jimbo looking so sharp.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.792
Is he bullying rich guys now?

02:24.854 --> 02:27.128
Fine round today, sir.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.723
You know,
I hope to be a doctor myself.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.484
It's always been my dream
to work around blood.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.319
(laughs)

02:34.512 --> 02:36.947
Well, maybe this will help
with medical school.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.643
Whoa! 20 bucks!

02:41.704 --> 02:43.495
(Jimbo chuckles)

02:43.688 --> 02:45.389
What the hell, Jimbo?
You just suck up to that guy

02:45.490 --> 02:46.648
and he gives you money?

02:46.709 --> 02:48.149
It's not sucking up.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.818
Rich guys love hearing
how great they are,

02:50.880 --> 02:52.654
and they're willing to pay
for it.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.656
Money pay.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.324
Mwah.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.427
Look away, pervs!

03:00.130 --> 03:01.996
We'd like jobs, please.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.350
Well, you seem a little young,
but I do need the help.

03:05.502 --> 03:07.352
I'm out several
of my best caddies

03:07.545 --> 03:09.746
due to an elaborate
virginity-losing wager.

03:09.806 --> 03:11.839
Here are your first assignments.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.936
You know, I've never really
sucked up to anyone before.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.255
Sure, I've lied,
scammed, grifted,

03:18.315 --> 03:20.181
but this feels different.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.366
Special.

03:21.518 --> 03:23.518
Well, I'm a Van Houten.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.112
Watch and learn.

03:26.265 --> 03:29.541
Dang! Looks like I got
the handsomest golfer

03:29.693 --> 03:31.451
in the whole damn club!

03:31.545 --> 03:33.620
-(shudders)
-(groans)

03:33.756 --> 03:36.289
You fine, boy!

03:36.383 --> 03:38.366
Hmm, you're new.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.327
Uh, that's why they
assigned me to you.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.222
The best way to learn the course

03:43.390 --> 03:45.057
is by watching
a master carve it up

03:45.250 --> 03:47.017
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

03:48.253 --> 03:49.427
Hmm.

03:49.621 --> 03:50.787
Hmm. That does sound

03:50.806 --> 03:51.972
like something they would say.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.399
(chuckles)
Let's play some golf.

03:54.592 --> 03:56.068
(exhales):
Whew.

03:56.261 --> 03:57.719
(grunting)

03:57.780 --> 03:59.145
Wait till my friends hear
I caddied

03:59.240 --> 04:01.815
for Kent "The Straight Dope"
Brockman.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.742
We watch you every night.

04:03.935 --> 04:07.079
Really? I thought youngsters got
their news from the Internet.

04:07.230 --> 04:10.898
Pfft. No way. My boys think
broadcast news is the swagness.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.085
And the girls call you
"a snack."

04:13.278 --> 04:15.420
Hope it's okay for me
to use the current lingo.

04:15.613 --> 04:17.422
The snack will allow it.

04:17.615 --> 04:20.241
Stacy and I,
well, it's, uh...

04:20.302 --> 04:21.318
it's complicated.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.077
Isn't it always?

04:23.097 --> 04:25.597
She's a terrific person
and a top-notch meteorologist.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.658
But if I'm dodging her calls
after three months...

04:28.719 --> 04:31.085
I think you've
already made up your mind.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.997
You just don't want to admit it,
'cause you're a kind person.

04:34.057 --> 04:36.191
Mm. Guilty as charged.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.503

They're called golf bats, Lis.

Your brother is doing a job.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.013
Aren't you?
(chuckles)

06:06.075 --> 06:07.324
Want to sneak a peek?

06:08.911 --> 06:12.946
...and in the end,
everyone lost money but me.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.356
Wow. I've learned so much today,

06:15.417 --> 06:18.952
about golf, life<i> and</i> oil leases.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.530
I wish I had tribal land
for you to build a pipeline on.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.884
I'd be honored if you'd frack
under my house someday, sir.

06:28.764 --> 06:32.432
Ugh. I've never seen my son...
suck up before.

06:33.802 --> 06:35.452
Easy money. Mwah.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.788
You don't kiss all the golfers'
butts like that, do you?

06:38.807 --> 06:41.900
Oh, Mom. These rich guys expect
a little... (smooching)

06:42.051 --> 06:44.628
in exchange for some... ah.

06:44.646 --> 06:46.053
It's no big deal.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.907
On one hand,
I'm glad you're being polite.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.316
On the other hand...

06:50.452 --> 06:52.411
(shudders loudly)

06:52.604 --> 06:55.580
Wow, I never thought of it
that way, Mom.

06:55.773 --> 06:58.417
No one looks out for me
the way you do.

06:58.610 --> 07:00.401
You are the shining star

07:00.462 --> 07:02.921

through the darkness.

07:03.114 --> 07:05.406
Oh, aren't you sweet.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.242
Why don't we stop by the
skateboard store on the way home

07:08.303 --> 07:09.486
and I'll buy you...
(gasps)

07:09.588 --> 07:10.595

07:17.995 --> 07:20.013
So, there we are
on the 18th green.

07:20.165 --> 07:21.831
The course has been a bear
all morning.

07:21.892 --> 07:24.017
I tell Judge Snyder
to shut that all out

07:24.169 --> 07:25.426
and just be in the moment.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.612
-He nods, plants his feet.
-(gasps) Mm-hmm?

07:27.764 --> 07:29.839

07:59.980 --> 08:02.630
(quietly): sucking up
to those golfers?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.966
Marge, sucking up
is the American way.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.634
In this country,
everybody got together

08:06.695 --> 08:08.895
and decided that all the money
should belong

08:09.047 --> 08:11.881
to a few dozen families
<i> and</i> their favorite suck-ups.

08:11.942 --> 08:15.309
Don't you remember
when we all decided that?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.478
-(groans)
-And of all the things

08:17.539 --> 08:19.164
that Bart might do for money,

08:19.357 --> 08:21.407
this is by far the most legal.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.335
Other people are paying our son.

08:23.486 --> 08:24.853
And in cash!

08:24.880 --> 08:27.822
It's both aboveboard
and under the table.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.916
That's the dream!

08:30.052 --> 08:32.252
Homie, I know it's not logical,

08:32.387 --> 08:34.420
but when I saw Bart
at that golf course,

08:34.556 --> 08:37.590
my mothering spirit
just wanted to hurl.

08:37.743 --> 08:39.592
Back me up on this one.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.078
Tell our son he has to quit.

08:42.138 --> 08:44.264
Quit being a caddy? No way!

08:44.358 --> 08:46.266
How much did Mom give you
to tell me that?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.601
Uh... n-nothing.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.028
Well, I can do better than that.

08:50.221 --> 08:52.272
Will 20 bucks make this go away?

08:52.366 --> 08:54.941
Well, I guess I can tell her
I did my best.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.278
Tell her you did your...
<i> very</i> best.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.687
Mm-hmm.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.098
Now that you got your own pool,

09:02.117 --> 09:04.117
what are you gonna buy next?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.526
I'm thinking
of getting one of those booths

09:05.629 --> 09:07.120
that blows money around.

09:07.272 --> 09:09.122
It pays for itself
the first time you get in it.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.607
Bart, no!

09:10.667 --> 09:12.551
That wad is your future.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.554
What you need is
a good investment vehicle.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.888
Hmm.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.635
I'm playing golf!

19:14.696 --> 19:16.379
(laughing)

19:16.439 --> 19:19.991
Rum-Ta-Tum, your time has come!

19:20.184 --> 19:21.534
RALPH:
Whee!

19:22.704 --> 19:24.495
(laughing)

19:24.688 --> 19:26.956
Class warfare!
(giggling)

19:31.487 --> 19:32.895
Bart Simpson,

19:32.914 --> 19:34.380
the next time
you want to make a point...

19:34.531 --> 19:38.567
(chuckles) I would prefer
you use your words.

19:38.628 --> 19:42.847
Did you honestly think a little
vandalism would shut<i> us</i> down?

19:42.998 --> 19:45.074
(chuckles)
Greens can be reseeded,

19:45.134 --> 19:48.427
traps re-sanded,
roughs unsmoothed.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.854
The club will go on.

19:50.005 --> 19:51.505
(siren wailing)

19:51.524 --> 19:55.151
Ah, and here are the police
to take you to jail.

19:56.687 --> 19:59.422
This is a raid!
We're closing the club down!

19:59.440 --> 20:01.273
Bildorf, you're under arrest.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.201
(scoffs)
Me?

20:03.352 --> 20:05.928
But<i> they</i> are
the ne'er-do-wells.

20:05.988 --> 20:09.098
I am the head
of a legitimate religion.

20:09.116 --> 20:10.449
You sure are.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.118
And like every new religion,
sooner or later,

20:13.213 --> 20:15.588
it turns into a sex cult.

20:21.504 --> 20:26.557
In your case,
it was<i> really...</i> sooner.
