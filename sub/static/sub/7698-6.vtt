WEBVTT

01:18.619 --> 01:20.454
<i>You've made wonderful
progress, Harley.</i>

01:20.830 --> 01:22.623
You've passed your competency hearing

01:22.707 --> 01:25.668
and tomorrow you'll be released,
mentally sane and sound.

01:26.002 --> 01:30.298
Whee! Who-hoo! Whoopie!
Yay! Yay! Yay!

01:31.132 --> 01:33.384
I mean, thank you, Dr. Leland.

01:33.884 --> 01:37.096
That's okay. You have every reason
to be proud of yourself.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.556
Unhand me!

01:38.723 --> 01:42.059
I just wish the other inmates
could make your sort of progress.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.730
I am the master of fear!
The lord of despair!

01:45.896 --> 01:47.898
Cower before me in witless terror!

01:47.982 --> 01:49.859
Hi, Professor Crane.

01:50.192 --> 01:54.322
Good evening, child. Worship me, fools!
Worship me!

01:54.405 --> 01:57.491
Scream hosannas of anguish to Scarecrow,

01:57.575 --> 02:00.119
the all-terrible god of fear!

02:00.620 --> 02:01.912
I think he's getting better.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.541
I hear you're getting out tomorrow.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.627
You got a problem with that?

02:08.377 --> 02:09.754
Congratulations.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.009
Yeah, so I made a few mistakes.

02:15.176 --> 02:18.471
I've got my head back together,
and I'm gonna live my life right.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.271
For your sake, I hope so.

02:30.858 --> 02:35.613
I'll show you. Starting tomorrow,
you'll see I'm just as sane as anybody.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.491
Oh, my Lord!

02:50.419 --> 02:52.213
Gee, what's wrong with them?

02:54.090 --> 02:55.675
I knew I shouldn't have
worn this outfit.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.386
It's so out of style, it's growing mold.

02:58.844 --> 03:01.347
I probably look like a total geek.

03:07.895 --> 03:10.690
Come on, babies, we're going shopping.

03:18.322 --> 03:19.699
I love it.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.033
That makes one of us.

03:21.242 --> 03:25.204
Really, Brucie, a man of your social
standing needs a woman like me

03:25.287 --> 03:27.081
to keep you in step
with the latest trends.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.209
Who dresses you anyway? Alfred?

03:30.584 --> 03:33.045
Well, actually...

03:37.299 --> 03:39.760
Excuse me, miss.
You can't bring those things in here.

03:40.344 --> 03:42.763
It's okay. They're housebroken.

03:55.067 --> 03:57.027
Are you all right?

03:58.988 --> 04:01.949
Wow, I never saw them do that before.

04:02.950 --> 04:04.869
Hey, don't I know you?

04:05.244 --> 04:06.954
I don't think so.

04:07.913 --> 04:10.082
Something about that chin.

04:10.541 --> 04:14.920
I know!
You're Bruce Wayne, the boy billionaire.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.133
Unattached, I see.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.261
May I help you, miss?

04:22.803 --> 04:25.473
Uh-oh! Enter the jealous girlfriend.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.393
Hey, remember me?
That big charity bash a few years back?

04:29.643 --> 04:30.853
The one the Joker robbed?

04:31.020 --> 04:33.814
I was the clown girl
holding the gun on you!

04:35.191 --> 04:38.110
Oh, don't worry, I'm over
the crime thing. See?

04:42.698 --> 04:46.535
I'm rehabilitated
and ready to live my life right.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.329
How nice for you.

04:48.996 --> 04:50.372
Goodbye.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.336
Gee, you make one little mistake
and they never let you forget.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.382
All I'm looking for
is a fair chance to start over.

05:00.716 --> 05:02.635
That's not asking too much, is it?

05:02.885 --> 05:04.303
Why, no.

05:09.099 --> 05:10.142
Miss?

05:10.768 --> 05:15.397
Ijust wanna live a normal life
without some cop always pouncing on me.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.235
Hey, what's the deal?

05:19.568 --> 05:20.611
Hold it.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.154
I didn't do anything.

05:22.446 --> 05:24.406
That's a security alarm.
Just give me back-

05:26.242 --> 05:29.411
That's my dress.
I paid for it fair and square.

05:29.662 --> 05:33.207
I know. Just let me remove
the security tag and- Whoa!

05:33.415 --> 05:35.167
It's a frame-up, a fix.

05:35.334 --> 05:38.337
You ain't taking me back
to the slammer, John Law.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.301
Hey!

05:46.762 --> 05:48.764
- What in heaven?
- Stay here.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.520
She ran in there.

05:54.728 --> 05:57.189
- Oh, my. Did you see that?
- What's going on?

06:01.694 --> 06:05.614
Miss, please, I'm sure this has all been
a simple misunderstanding.

06:06.282 --> 06:10.536
You don't wanna mess things up
on your first day out, do you? Miss?

06:14.582 --> 06:17.501
I tried to play by the rules, but no,

06:17.710 --> 06:21.255
they wouldn't let me go straight.
Society is to blame.

06:22.506 --> 06:26.051
Back off, rich boy, I'm armed.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.812
Scoot over, toots, I'm driving.

06:37.104 --> 06:38.814
Come to Mommy!

06:47.990 --> 06:49.533
Hold on!

06:57.917 --> 07:00.002
Oh! You're gonna pay for that.

07:07.801 --> 07:10.429
Let me get this right, Commissioner.

07:11.138 --> 07:13.891
You're saying that milksop Bruce Wayne

07:13.974 --> 07:17.811
allowed a crazy woman
in a clown suit to kidnap my Veronica?

07:17.895 --> 07:19.855
Wayne did what he could,
General Vreeland.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.150
And for what it's worth, I don't think
Harley Quinn means to hurt Veronica.

07:23.233 --> 07:24.735
This is her first day out of Arkham

07:24.818 --> 07:26.904
and the threat of being
sent back probably spooked her.

07:26.987 --> 07:30.699
I want action, Gordon, not excuses.
My daughter's in danger.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.787
I need SWAT teams,
helicopters, full military backup!

07:38.624 --> 07:40.000
I... I'm sorry, Jim.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.379
All I want is my little Veronica
returned safe and sound.

07:44.171 --> 07:48.217
If you could just give this old soldier
a moment to compose himself.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.760
Certainly, sir.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.357
Lieutenant, General Vreeland here.

08:03.732 --> 08:05.359
I'm calling a code red.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.990
Sounds like Harley didn't waste
any time getting into trouble.

08:11.323 --> 08:12.533
She's good at that.

08:15.285 --> 08:18.455
Still, I think she really wanted
to do right this time.

08:18.872 --> 08:22.501
If we can find her first, maybe we can
stop her from ruining her chance.

08:25.421 --> 08:29.425
According to the scanner,
your car should be right about here.

08:39.768 --> 08:41.478
Ha! I got you now.

08:49.319 --> 08:50.320
Huh?

09:00.914 --> 09:02.458
Please, Ms. Clown.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.710
Call me Harley. Everyone does.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.254
Please, Harley, let me go. I'm rich.

09:07.337 --> 09:08.922
I'll pay whatever you want
if you'll just-

09:10.799 --> 09:12.843
Uh-oh! Company.

09:16.096 --> 09:18.348
Hi, B-man. Wanna race?

09:18.932 --> 09:20.768
Stop the car now!

09:21.268 --> 09:22.895
I think not.

09:23.270 --> 09:26.315
We wanna help you sort this out
before it gets worse.

09:26.648 --> 09:29.818
Sure, like you helped
poor Professor Crane last night.

09:30.652 --> 09:33.822
Sorry, boys, you ain't taking me
back to Arkham.

09:51.381 --> 09:54.468
I'm gonna get that little kook
if it's the last thing I ever do.

09:57.679 --> 09:59.807
The scanner says
she's headed for the south side.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.851
Probably to someone who can hide her
until the heat's off.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.653
The last time I seen you,
you not only ruined my club

10:12.945 --> 10:15.239
but brought the freaking Batman
down on my head as well.

10:16.281 --> 10:18.534
Give me one good reason
I do not dust you right now.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.208
L'll buy that.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.130
No sweat, toots,
Boxy will take care of us.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.715
That's what I'm afraid of.

10:37.010 --> 10:39.763
So, how soon can you
sneak me out of town?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.014
Leave us not be hasty.

10:41.515 --> 10:45.060
We have a friendship to renew
and Ms. Money-Bags to ransom off.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.734
Oh, no. We can't do that.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.778
See, I'm giving up the crime thing.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.905
I only grabbed her because
I needed a car.

10:57.072 --> 11:00.159
Once I'm gone,
she goes home safe and sound.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.496
I'm calling the shots here, sugar.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.249
Anyone says different
has to go through me, got it?

11:07.332 --> 11:08.542
Got it.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.674
You've stuck your cape
into my business for the last time.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.680
Take 'em, boys.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.226
- Get him! Get him!
- Come back here!

11:46.496 --> 11:48.415
We're safe, thank goodness.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.418
Ahh!

11:51.793 --> 11:54.171
Back off, freak, or the dame's history.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.634
Get your own hostage.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.078
Sorry, doll.

12:26.536 --> 12:28.956
As we gamblers say,
you just crapped out.

12:39.424 --> 12:41.635
- Any last words?
- Just one.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.600
Play nice with your new chew toy.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.831
Ahh!

13:25.679 --> 13:27.973
- Harley's gone again.
- So is Bennett.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.936
Did you mean what you said back there
about sending me home?

13:33.270 --> 13:34.730
Sure. You're a good kid,

13:35.022 --> 13:38.025
and I do kind of feel
a little bit responsible for all this.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.526
No kidding.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.532
So, what will happen to you?

13:45.907 --> 13:47.826
If I'm lucky, I'll make it out of town

13:47.909 --> 13:50.120
before Bats hauls
my hiney back to the bin.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.789
Can't you explain
that it was all just a mistake?

13:53.248 --> 13:56.835
Ha! With my past?
I don't even believe it myself.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.176
Look, let's make a deal.

14:04.634 --> 14:08.013
You get me out of this alive,
and I'll drop all the charges.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.934
Yeah? Hey, you're all right, toots.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.688
For the first time today,
I think things are finally looking up.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.955
<i>You in the car,
release your hostage immediately.</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:35.415
Daddy!

14:35.957 --> 14:37.000
Daddy?

14:49.054 --> 14:51.390
Wait. What are you doing?
That's my father.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.810
No, that's your father in a tank!

15:08.615 --> 15:09.866
No, you don't.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.972
<i>All units, suspect Quinn
has been sighted</i>

15:32.055 --> 15:33.306
<i>headed for Gotham City Square.</i>

16:02.461 --> 16:04.379
Oh, great.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.275
- Got you now.
- You screwy little-

16:25.358 --> 16:26.651
Trouble-making clown.

16:35.118 --> 16:36.161
Veronica?

16:42.792 --> 16:45.295
Hey, bird-boy, look alive.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.716
Well, that's my good deed for the day.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.051
Bye-

16:51.843 --> 16:52.928
Wait!

17:04.314 --> 17:06.858
My little girl. I was so worried.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.109
Inoficed.

17:10.820 --> 17:11.863
Whoa!

17:13.907 --> 17:15.408
Leaving so soon, Boxy?

17:15.825 --> 17:17.244
You got nothing on me.

17:20.288 --> 17:22.123
I'm sure I can find something.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.750
Move it.

17:33.593 --> 17:35.136
You don't know when to quit, do you?

17:38.974 --> 17:42.602
Listen to me.
All the work you've done, your freedom.

17:43.061 --> 17:45.438
If you run away,
you'll lose them, Harley.

17:46.022 --> 17:48.525
You're so close
to winning back your real life.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.776
Why risk it now?

17:53.446 --> 17:55.740
I'm having a bad day!

17:55.824 --> 18:00.161
I'm sick of people trying to shoot me,
run me over and blow me up!

18:06.376 --> 18:08.753
I didn't even get to keep my new dress,

18:09.170 --> 18:11.840
and I actually paid for it!

18:19.556 --> 18:22.183
I tried to be good. I really did.

18:22.475 --> 18:24.728
But if that's not good enough, fine!

18:26.730 --> 18:28.773
Let's get back to basics.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.051
Talk about grasping at straws.

18:56.217 --> 18:59.220
Oh, well,
at least I'm going out on a joke.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.236
I think I made a mess on your cape.

19:23.995 --> 19:26.790
Home again, home again, jiggity-jig.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.627
Not for too long, though. Ms. Vreeland
dropped the kidnapping charges.

19:30.877 --> 19:34.506
With a little more hard work, you should
be ready to reenter society for good.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.715
Yay.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.176
There's one thing I gotta know.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.346
Why did you stay with me all day,
risking your butt for someone

19:41.429 --> 19:43.890
who's never given you anything
but trouble?

19:44.057 --> 19:46.267
I know what it's like
to try and rebuild a life.

19:49.020 --> 19:51.147
I had a bad day too, once.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.778
Nice guys like you
shouldn't have bad days.

20:17.340 --> 20:18.425
Call me.

20:18.925 --> 20:20.844
Don't press your luck.

20:29.602 --> 20:31.896
Ah, what are you looking at?
