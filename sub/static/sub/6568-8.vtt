00:19.044 --> 00:21.312
<i>Thank you so much for
setting this interview up, Dan.</i>

00:21.346 --> 00:22.813
- I really appreciate it. It's perfect.
- My pleasure.

00:22.847 --> 00:24.281
Look, this is a walk
in the park.

00:24.315 --> 00:27.251
This is a nice casual
conversation between two friends.

00:27.286 --> 00:30.389
- Today, America is a guest in your home.
- Welcome, America.

00:30.457 --> 00:33.327
The thing to keep in mind is Janet
needs this more than you do.

00:33.361 --> 00:36.396
That is so true. I mean, she's
kind of a lightweight now.

00:36.430 --> 00:39.021
- We're doing her a favor.
- She's a dud.

00:39.141 --> 00:41.267
You know what? We got to prep.
Prep time, let's go.

00:41.387 --> 00:44.104
- Okay.
- The song that offended half of Europe?

00:44.139 --> 00:45.706
It didn't offend
half of Europe.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.510
Okay, fine. Well, I have
to tell you, Janet,

00:48.578 --> 00:50.179
that was a lighthearted parody.

00:50.213 --> 00:52.015
On the campaign trail, you
and Andrew were all smiles,

00:52.049 --> 00:54.651
but behind the scenes you were
fighting like snakes in a bag.

00:54.719 --> 00:56.754
You're a fraud
and a liar, ma'am.

00:56.788 --> 00:59.390
- Wow. What? What are you doing?
- I'm hitting you.

00:59.424 --> 01:01.892
Guys, we're prepping for a
puff piece, not for a roast.

01:01.926 --> 01:03.327
Right. What is she
wearing, by the way?

01:03.361 --> 01:06.197
She's wearing a navy jacket.

01:06.231 --> 01:08.467
It's conservative and
desperate at the same time.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.235
What? Look at what I'm wearing.

01:10.269 --> 01:12.771
Do we know what she's wearing yet?
Can we find out?

01:12.805 --> 01:14.540
We are gonna go in there
in just a moment.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.409
- They're expecting a puff piece.
- Right.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.604
There's the bluff puff which
we're gonna start out with.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.447
You're her friend. You went
to high school together.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.616
You guys like each other. Then we
switch right over to rough puff.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.585
Nobody does
rough puff like you.

01:24.619 --> 01:26.487
Rrr. Give me that rough puff.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.289
- All right, Puff Daddy.
- Ooh.

01:28.323 --> 01:29.824
What is this one doing?

01:29.858 --> 01:32.961
He is moving a legless horse.

01:32.995 --> 01:34.696
- Oh, Catherine.
- Miss Ryland.

01:34.730 --> 01:36.565
It is such an honor
to meet you.

01:36.599 --> 01:38.801
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:38.835 --> 01:40.536
- I'm such a fan of yours.
- Thank you.

01:40.570 --> 01:42.805
I actually am hoping to study
broadcast journalism.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.109
Right now I'm studying film
studies and postmodern dance.

01:46.143 --> 01:48.845
How wonderful. We'll
have to talk about that

01:48.879 --> 01:51.181
- when the cameras are rolling.
- <i>I would love that.</i>

01:51.215 --> 01:52.616
I'm taking
this really cool class

01:52.683 --> 01:54.985
where we sort of debate current
issues through movement.

01:55.053 --> 01:56.553
- Let's get you miked up.
- Oh.

01:56.588 --> 01:58.022
Oh, my God.
This is a problem.

01:58.056 --> 01:59.890
- Look at this.
- For the poof, you mean?

01:59.925 --> 02:01.425
Put your hands in your pockets.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.728
Looks like I'm masturbating
if I got my hands in my pockets.

02:03.762 --> 02:06.298
Put the blanket over it,
or is that too FDR?

02:06.333 --> 02:07.573
Can you guys please kneel down?

02:07.601 --> 02:09.602
'Cause I feel like I fell
into a well or something

02:09.636 --> 02:11.137
<i>and it's hurting my neck.</i>

02:11.171 --> 02:13.173
Okay, they're gonna bring up
the rafting trip.

02:13.207 --> 02:15.442
Well, I took my ex
down to the river

02:15.476 --> 02:19.313
and I tried to smash his head
in with a rock and then drown--

02:19.347 --> 02:20.948
- This is Cody Marshall.
- Cody Marshall.

02:20.982 --> 02:22.783
- <i>He's the producer for "First Response."</i>
- Hi, Cody Marshall.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.986
I'm sorry, am I interrupting
a team prayer meeting?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.988
We're just
doing a height thing.

02:27.056 --> 02:28.890
- It was nothing.
- <i>Okay. Good luck, everyone.</i>

02:28.925 --> 02:31.159
Thank you so much.
Very kind. Thank you.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.195
Thanks for being here.
We really appreciate it.

02:33.229 --> 02:36.165
Okay, she's wearing
a bluish dress

02:36.199 --> 02:37.766
like she vomited flowers
all over herself.

02:37.801 --> 02:39.969
- She's kind of a frumpy librarian.
- Okay. All right.

02:40.003 --> 02:42.071
- Yes! All right, we're in business.
- What?

02:42.139 --> 02:43.419
Just confirmed--
a leaked e-mail.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.576
Her ex-husband promising
access for business favors.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.979
- He actually brags about it.
- I know.

02:49.013 --> 02:51.781
- It's almost too painful.
- Brags about access.

02:51.816 --> 02:53.316
Just drag her in
with the kindness,

02:53.351 --> 02:55.252
then turn great white and start
taking chunks out of her.

02:55.353 --> 02:56.753
She's not much of a meal.

02:56.788 --> 02:58.722
- Oh, is it Greg?
- Gary.

02:58.756 --> 03:00.557
Gary, we're all set up,
so if you can...

03:00.592 --> 03:03.093
Yeah, great.
Yeah.

03:03.128 --> 03:05.629
- Madam Vice President.
- Janet Ryland.

03:05.664 --> 03:08.800
Gosh, I think the last time that
we saw each other was at the...

03:08.834 --> 03:10.936
- The Correspondents' Dinner.
- The Correspondents' Dinner.

03:10.970 --> 03:13.372
That's right. I think
you've grown since then.

03:13.406 --> 03:14.846
Either that or you've
gotten shorter.

03:14.874 --> 03:16.208
Oh, well...

03:16.243 --> 03:17.910
No, it's me.
I've got heels on.

03:17.945 --> 03:19.946
Well, anyway,
I'm so happy you're here.

03:20.014 --> 03:22.048
So you found the joint okay.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.718
Oh, yeah, I think this is our
fourth vice presidential interview.

03:24.752 --> 03:26.053
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

03:26.088 --> 03:28.122
The three of them were
excellent, so no pressure.

03:28.190 --> 03:31.059
- He's talking to me.
- Okay.

03:31.093 --> 03:33.261
So what is the plan, then?
What are we going to do?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.098
Well, we'll start, I think, just
with a little walk around the room.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.767
And then the formal interview,
I thought, right here.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.269
- Oh, right here? Okay.
- Yeah.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.138
But that means
that this has to go.

03:42.172 --> 03:44.173
I thought you were
doing it over there.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.976
No, we did, but we're gonna do it
here, and that's perfectly fine.

03:47.010 --> 03:50.213
So we'll get
that poor thing away.

03:50.247 --> 03:52.348
Anyway, have you met
my daughter?

03:52.383 --> 03:55.285
So you did get my final
e-mail on topics?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.887
- No, but my spam filter did.
- Seriously, did you get it?

03:57.922 --> 04:00.357
Did I?

04:00.391 --> 04:03.393
Yeah, we're all set. Let's
make some history here, folks.

04:03.428 --> 04:05.396
<i>Okay, roll cameras.</i>

04:05.430 --> 04:07.765
Thank you so much
for inviting us

04:07.799 --> 04:09.867
into your home today,
Madam Vice President.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.535
Oh, well, it's certainly
my pleasure.

04:11.603 --> 04:15.006
I thought it might be fun
to talk about what's original

04:15.040 --> 04:16.908
and what's been augmented
over the years.

04:16.942 --> 04:19.077
We're talking about
the building, right?

04:21.714 --> 04:24.550
- Because I'm original.
- You certainly are.

04:24.584 --> 04:26.251
- No, yes, the building, ma'am.
- Yes.

04:26.319 --> 04:29.387
<i>The building itself
is Queen Anne style.</i>

04:29.422 --> 04:33.158
Many of the objay-ects--
objects

04:33.192 --> 04:36.128
are from the good old boys in
the Navy, as a matter of fact.

04:36.162 --> 04:37.729
- Really?
- Jolly Jack Tars.

04:37.764 --> 04:41.767
For instance, this-- this
spyglass here, or telescope--

04:41.801 --> 04:43.335
To see spies.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.670
If only, right?

04:44.704 --> 04:46.638
You know, since you
brought it up,

04:46.706 --> 04:49.274
would you care to comment
on the CIA operative

04:49.309 --> 04:51.777
rescued with the students
in Uzbekistan?

04:51.811 --> 04:54.746
Well, I really-- I
wouldn't know what to say

04:54.780 --> 04:56.848
because at this point

04:56.882 --> 04:59.384
the investigation is pending.

04:59.418 --> 05:02.187
Now this here

05:02.222 --> 05:05.190
is a stunning sort
of navigational device.

05:05.224 --> 05:07.125
I just thought you
might want to comment

05:07.160 --> 05:10.696
on how he endangered the lives
of those young students.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.931
But it would be
wrong and unethical

05:12.998 --> 05:16.935
for me to prejudge
the investigation.

05:19.938 --> 05:21.939
This is a bell.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.908
Can we get some shots of just you
and Janet walking in the hallway?

05:24.943 --> 05:26.176
- Sure.
- No sound.

05:26.211 --> 05:27.845
We're gonna just do
some establishing shots.

05:27.879 --> 05:29.713
- We'll put her voice over--
- We'll lay that in later.

05:29.747 --> 05:32.015
- Yeah, okay.
<i>- And action.</i>

05:33.751 --> 05:36.486
Yeah, I thought we said
that the spy thing

05:36.521 --> 05:38.622
was completely
off-limits, you know?

05:38.656 --> 05:40.157
I'm sorry,
it seemed to me--

05:40.191 --> 05:42.827
I'm really hoping that
that's gonna be the last

05:42.861 --> 05:45.796
and only gotcha question.

05:45.831 --> 05:49.867
It just seemed to me that you
were wanting me to bring it up.

05:49.902 --> 05:52.570
No, that wasn't
the case at all.

05:52.638 --> 05:54.206
I understand why you're tense.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.674
No, I'm not tense, Janet.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.409
I'm not even remotely tense.

05:57.476 --> 05:59.578
Just trying
to get this done right.

05:59.612 --> 06:02.113
- Mm-hmm.
- This is some old shit

06:02.148 --> 06:03.948
by somebody,
I don't know who it is.

06:03.982 --> 06:06.184
- Is this house haunted?
- Oh, God, I don't know.

06:06.218 --> 06:08.052
I hate this house,
to tell you the truth.

06:08.087 --> 06:10.621
It's like living
in a doll's jail.

06:10.656 --> 06:12.897
- Cynthia, could I get clips?
<i>- Okay, let's settle.</i>

06:12.925 --> 06:15.394
- <i>Clear the background, please.</i>
- Gives you a nicer line.

06:15.428 --> 06:17.962
- Oh, really?
- You don't need clips. Your shape is great.

06:17.997 --> 06:19.597
- But what about this?
- Oh, my God.

06:19.631 --> 06:22.500
Okay, here, let's tuck this under.
Put your hands like this.

06:24.937 --> 06:27.205
- But that looks like I have a stomachache.
- Thank you so much.

06:27.239 --> 06:30.241
Okay, let's roll cameras.

06:30.276 --> 06:32.677
Everybody settle in here.
Thank you, Glen.

06:32.711 --> 06:34.445
- <i>Sound?</i>
<i>- Sound speeding.</i>

06:34.480 --> 06:36.347
And we are rolling.

06:36.381 --> 06:38.716
You know what? I'm feeling
a little bit dark.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.751
Yeah, just want to...

06:40.785 --> 06:43.120
Gary, can we get
that light back?

06:43.154 --> 06:45.622
Sorry, let's move
that light back.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.757
Can we get a couple of lights
for the vice president?

06:47.792 --> 06:49.860
Yeah, let me just pull
that out of my ass.

06:49.894 --> 06:52.896
It's DC. You can find someone willing
to open their ass on a Sunday.

06:52.931 --> 06:55.366
Great, good luck.
Sound is speeding.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.935
Everyone is set and settled.
They look great.

06:58.003 --> 07:00.071
And rolling.

07:02.374 --> 07:04.307
Have you read Randall Howard's

07:04.342 --> 07:07.177
"Hearts of Power: DC's
Most Influential Couples"?

07:07.211 --> 07:09.780
Sadly, I don't have a lot
of time to read fiction.

07:11.983 --> 07:14.952
<i>Now, during the election,</i>

07:14.986 --> 07:17.087
there were reports
of screaming matches

07:17.121 --> 07:19.356
with you and your
ex-husband Andrew

07:19.390 --> 07:22.026
and suggestions that the
smiles and shows of affection

07:22.093 --> 07:23.527
<i>were all faked for the camera.</i>

07:23.561 --> 07:26.363
<i>Was your friendship</i>
<i>all for show?</i>

07:26.398 --> 07:28.599
Absolutely not.

07:28.633 --> 07:31.702
Now, Andrew was on
the campaign trail with me,

07:31.736 --> 07:34.872
really, because he shared,
and still does share,

07:34.906 --> 07:36.707
my vision for America.

07:36.741 --> 07:39.043
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- We'd like to reset for lighting.</i>

07:39.077 --> 07:41.412
- We're gonna reset for lighting.
- Just a quick lighting reset.

07:41.447 --> 07:44.749
And, really, she can
move on from Andrew.

07:44.817 --> 07:46.457
I mean, she can push
as much as she likes,

07:46.485 --> 07:48.653
but you're just gonna get
the same answer, so...

07:48.688 --> 07:51.156
Hmm, have you seen
television news before?

07:51.190 --> 07:53.825
No, I am hoping to get the box
set for Christmas, though.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.561
- That's what it feels like.
- Uh-huh.

07:55.595 --> 07:57.963
What? Excuse me.

07:57.997 --> 08:00.599
- Okay.
- Yes?

08:00.667 --> 08:02.368
- What are you--
- Come here.

08:02.402 --> 08:05.104
- Why? Why are you calling me?
- Come here.

08:05.138 --> 08:07.907
Jesus, you might as well
cut out eyeholes

08:07.941 --> 08:10.609
and peer through a fucking newspaper.
What the fuck are you doing?

08:10.644 --> 08:12.411
It's "Apocalypse Now."

08:12.445 --> 08:14.747
There's an e-mail
from Andrew to a lobbyist.

08:14.814 --> 08:16.615
He's claiming
super access to Selina.

08:16.649 --> 08:18.617
- He's bragging about it.
- This?

08:18.652 --> 08:20.353
It's fucking Andrew, yeah.

08:20.387 --> 08:22.021
- Madam Vice President.
- Yes? Yes?

08:22.055 --> 08:25.190
Does your ex-husband Andrew
have any political aspirations?

08:25.225 --> 08:26.905
- Oh, my goodness.
- We've got to tell her.

08:26.927 --> 08:30.195
- We've got to tell her.
- No, no, no, don't say anything to Selina.

08:30.230 --> 08:31.931
- Why?
- 'Cause Janet's right there.

08:31.965 --> 08:33.532
You don't think she's gonna notice
we're whispering in her ear?

08:33.567 --> 08:35.433
Then she gets on and she tells
this dildo to look it up.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.436
- And then we have a fucking story.
- What's going on?

08:37.470 --> 08:38.736
Andrew's fucking us again.

08:38.772 --> 08:40.639
He's screwed us
in all known dimensions.

08:40.707 --> 08:42.241
- What's new?
- Another scandal.

08:42.275 --> 08:44.177
Yeah, but this
is fucking bad shit.

08:44.211 --> 08:45.812
He's political poison.
He's political--

08:45.846 --> 08:47.814
- Hi, Andrew.
- Andrew.

08:47.848 --> 08:50.483
He's been in commercial
real estate his entire life.

08:50.517 --> 08:52.986
So there's no reason there would
be-- should be a crossover?

08:53.020 --> 08:55.355
Well, I certainly
couldn't, you know,

08:55.389 --> 08:58.691
answer that question for him.

08:58.726 --> 09:01.962
Would it surprise you
to learn that only moments ago

09:01.996 --> 09:04.264
a blog has reported
that your ex-husband

09:04.298 --> 09:08.101
promised a lobbyist favorable
access to your office?

09:09.771 --> 09:11.405
Um...

09:11.439 --> 09:13.674
It does exist
in an actual e-mail

09:13.708 --> 09:16.843
- from your ex-husband.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

09:16.877 --> 09:20.046
"Hi, Jim. Remember, I have
the vice president's ear

09:20.081 --> 09:22.516
and I can get all kinds
of access to her."

09:22.550 --> 09:26.620
<i>And then there's one</i>
<i>of those winking emoticons</i>

09:26.654 --> 09:28.722
<i>at the bottom there.</i>

09:28.756 --> 09:31.058
I'm guessing that that was
meant as some sort of a joke.

09:31.092 --> 09:34.528
You know, Andrew Meyer
has no influence whatsoever

09:34.562 --> 09:37.097
over my decision-making.

09:37.132 --> 09:39.132
It's hard to believe because
you've just painted a picture

09:39.167 --> 09:42.469
of your relationship being
very close, extremely close.

09:42.503 --> 09:44.938
We're not
telepathically linked.

09:44.972 --> 09:47.407
- He can't read my mind.
<i>- Hey, that's our 15 minutes.</i>

09:47.441 --> 09:49.743
<i>That's the 15-minute mark.</i>
<i>Great. Great.</i>

09:51.779 --> 09:54.414
- Let's take a
- Oh! Let's take a-God!

09:54.449 --> 09:56.316
- Okay.
<i>- Are you okay, Gary?</i>

09:56.351 --> 09:58.585
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

09:58.619 --> 10:00.220
Sorry, could I just
adjust your radio mike?

10:00.254 --> 10:01.688
- I'm getting some static.
- I got it.

10:01.722 --> 10:04.057
Ow! Whoa! Okay, my ears
are my livelihood.

10:04.091 --> 10:05.758
- You don't need to--
- Okay, I bet.

10:05.793 --> 10:07.493
All right.
Let's just back off.

10:07.528 --> 10:11.030
I know that you want to
kill somebody right now...

10:11.098 --> 10:13.599
- Yeah.
- ...but unfortunately it can't be anyone in the building.

10:13.633 --> 10:16.102
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:16.136 --> 10:19.038
When Selina told me who was
gonna be interviewing me,

10:19.073 --> 10:20.439
you couldn't keep me away.

10:20.474 --> 10:22.675
- Talk to you a little later on.
- Wonderful.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.977
- I look forward to it.
- I do, too.

10:24.011 --> 10:26.613
But let's take you now
and get you all changed

10:26.647 --> 10:28.381
and fixed up.

10:28.415 --> 10:31.151
When we were married, he took
longer in the bathroom than I did.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.887
- That's not true. Why would you say that?
- Just get in here.

10:35.423 --> 10:37.558
- What the hell is this thing?
- That's a cable.

10:37.592 --> 10:39.326
- Oh, shit.
- There's a cable.

10:39.394 --> 10:41.662
Listen to me.
What were you thinking?

10:41.696 --> 10:43.263
What?
It was a joke.

10:43.298 --> 10:45.499
Once again, Andrew,
you have totally

10:45.534 --> 10:48.569
lived down to my expectations.

10:48.603 --> 10:51.305
When I invited you here
to the residence

10:51.339 --> 10:53.507
to fuck me, I didn't mean this.

10:53.541 --> 10:54.942
Aren't we using each other?

10:54.976 --> 10:56.310
What are you talking about?

10:56.344 --> 10:58.546
Okay, I'll spell it
out for you.

10:58.580 --> 11:01.916
How easy is it for the Vice
President of the United States

11:01.950 --> 11:04.719
of America to get
some casual sex, hmm?

11:04.787 --> 11:06.688
I'm convenient.

11:06.722 --> 11:09.056
- And, I know--
- Let me tell you something.

11:09.091 --> 11:12.160
<i>That's right, I am the Vice
President of the United States</i>

11:12.228 --> 11:16.531
and I choose now
not to fuck you anymore.

11:16.565 --> 11:18.766
Time will tell.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.802
I've got to change.

11:20.870 --> 11:22.370
Yeah, you look awful.

11:22.404 --> 11:24.605
- You look wonderful.
- Stop it.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.008
Ahem, he's gonna go
just change.

11:27.042 --> 11:29.010
- Wait, where's he going?
- To get my stuff.

11:29.044 --> 11:30.511
In my bedroom.

11:30.546 --> 11:32.380
Oh, no. Uh-uh.

11:32.414 --> 11:35.116
Oh, Andrew's been veep-fucking?
You knew about this?

11:35.150 --> 11:37.719
Okay, this is a category
five shit storm.

11:37.753 --> 11:40.054
She's over.
She's done. I'm gone.

11:40.089 --> 11:43.958
<i>Um, I'm wondering
if we can get just a shot</i>

11:43.993 --> 11:46.361
of Andrew's entrance
just for establishing.

11:46.395 --> 11:48.529
So you guys meet here,
kiss, kiss, hi, hi.

11:48.564 --> 11:49.831
It's a family getting together.

11:49.865 --> 11:52.200
No, no, I understand
what an entrance is

11:52.234 --> 11:53.668
and how to greet people.
I get that.

11:53.702 --> 11:55.603
<i>That's great.
Oh, here he comes!</i>

11:55.637 --> 11:57.705
<i>No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

11:57.773 --> 11:59.413
No, no, you're
not gonna get this.

11:59.441 --> 12:01.042
I'm so sorry.
We're not gonna do that.

12:01.077 --> 12:02.844
We don't have a front
door in our attic

12:02.878 --> 12:05.079
like in some sort of
Dr. Seuss book or something.

12:05.114 --> 12:07.914
Sometimes filming these off-guarded
moments, things get a little tense.

12:07.917 --> 12:09.584
Well, no,
it's not tense at all.

12:09.618 --> 12:11.653
We're having a great time and
I'm thrilled you guys are here,

12:11.687 --> 12:13.048
but let's just do it
the right way.

12:13.056 --> 12:14.956
- Andrew!
- Hi, Dad.

12:14.991 --> 12:16.891
How are you? Nice to see you.
Excuse me.

12:16.926 --> 12:19.761
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

12:19.795 --> 12:21.863
- Dad.
- Hi. How are you?

12:21.897 --> 12:24.866
- How often does this happen?
- Oh, gosh.

12:24.901 --> 12:27.702
Once a week we get together
for a gab and a gobble.

12:27.737 --> 12:30.772
Yeah, well, I mean, you know,
schedules permitting and stuff

12:30.806 --> 12:33.909
because now I really
consider myself to be married

12:33.943 --> 12:36.345
to my vice presidential office.

12:36.379 --> 12:38.714
I mean, recently Mary King
and I were working

12:38.748 --> 12:41.382
through the night
to avoid this shutdown.

12:41.417 --> 12:44.486
And of course it wasn't--
it wasn't avoided, sadly.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.088
Do you think you could have
worked a little harder on that?

12:47.123 --> 12:49.324
Well, we are working harder.

12:49.358 --> 12:51.893
- It's frustrating, of course.
- Sure.

12:51.927 --> 12:54.829
- To the American people it is.
- It's a very long process.

12:54.863 --> 12:57.198
Knock, knock,
J Rock is in the--

12:57.232 --> 13:00.201
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We're in the middle of filming.

13:00.236 --> 13:03.138
- Oh, my goodness, Jonah.
- J Dog. J Dog.

13:03.172 --> 13:05.240
- Howdy, handsome. How are you?
- How are you doing?

13:05.308 --> 13:06.975
- Hey, Jonah.
- Great to see you again.

13:07.009 --> 13:09.177
God, you've grown up, huh?

13:09.212 --> 13:11.747
- I had a great time at your birthday party.
- That's great.

13:11.781 --> 13:13.382
Great to see you.
Hey, how's it hanging?

13:13.416 --> 13:17.753
Jonah is our-- dear Jonah
is our White House liaison.

13:17.787 --> 13:19.855
Guilty.

13:19.889 --> 13:23.492
And he's one of the more colorful
characters in the West Wing.

13:23.526 --> 13:25.193
I'll say. That was
quite an entrance.

13:25.228 --> 13:26.928
Oh, thank you.
I try to make a mark.

13:26.963 --> 13:29.364
I just want to say
I'm a huge fan, by the way.

13:29.398 --> 13:30.932
- I love your work genuinely.
- Thank you.

13:30.966 --> 13:32.467
And, actually, I'm gonna
give you my card

13:32.501 --> 13:34.302
just in case you ever need
any sort of, like,

13:34.336 --> 13:36.171
"inside the West Wing"
kind of stuff.

13:36.205 --> 13:38.073
I do occasional
media appearances.

13:38.107 --> 13:39.741
I give great talking head.

13:39.775 --> 13:42.610
Jonah, to what may
we owe this pleasure?

13:42.645 --> 13:44.846
Oh, I just got off the phone
with the White House

13:44.880 --> 13:47.014
and in 15 minutes
POTUS is going to announce

13:47.049 --> 13:48.883
that the shutdown is over.

13:50.452 --> 13:52.686
- Is that true?
- Isn't that great?

13:52.721 --> 13:55.222
- <i>Isn't that great?</i>
- Move in on her.

13:55.256 --> 13:57.458
Yeah, the Speaker,
Senate Majority Leader,

13:57.492 --> 13:59.393
and POTUS,
they thrashed out a deal

13:59.428 --> 14:02.730
- and we switched America back on.
- Uh-huh, yes.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.732
- Congratulations, Madam Vice President.
- Thank you.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.168
We did it. We did it. You did it.

14:07.202 --> 14:10.104
The resolution took less
time than you anticipated.

14:10.139 --> 14:13.307
Well, it took all the time
leading up to this time.

14:13.342 --> 14:15.743
So you were expecting
a solution today?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.044
Yes, I was, yes.

14:17.079 --> 14:19.713
And yet you said it was
going to be a long process.

14:19.748 --> 14:22.549
And it was, yeah.
It was.

14:22.584 --> 14:24.351
Were you involved
in the--

14:24.386 --> 14:26.053
Janet, it's like when
you loosen a pickle jar

14:26.087 --> 14:27.721
and somebody comes by
and they just open it.

14:27.756 --> 14:30.157
<i>This is the shutdown</i>
<i>lid loosener.</i>

14:30.192 --> 14:33.194
- The pickle jar loosener.
- I like it.

14:33.228 --> 14:36.564
No, but can you talk us
through the final agreement?

14:36.599 --> 14:39.100
I can-- it's--
you know--

14:39.135 --> 14:42.304
I can and I also
want to eat some lunch.

14:42.338 --> 14:43.972
Are we hungry?

14:44.007 --> 14:46.407
<i>- Mm-hmm, definitely.</i>
<i>- Yeah, let's get some lunch.</i>

14:46.409 --> 14:48.343
<i>That's a cut.</i>
<i>Yeah, I think that's a cut.</i>

14:48.378 --> 14:49.745
<i>- Lunchtime.</i>
<i>- That's a cut.</i>

14:49.779 --> 14:51.513
- Okay, she doesn't--
- Oh, my God, she didn't know.

14:51.547 --> 14:54.016
That reminded me why
I got into this business.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.285
I am so attracted
to you right now.

14:56.319 --> 14:59.054
I think that I'd like
to just sit back

14:59.088 --> 15:00.789
and watch you all
prepare this meal.

15:00.824 --> 15:01.923
- Pretend I'm not here.
- Mm-hmm.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.658
<i>I kind of want to be</i>
<i>the fly on a wall.</i>

15:03.693 --> 15:06.661
Oh, my God. Andrew, that's
getting everywhere.

15:06.695 --> 15:09.397
Um, I'm gonna get you a...

15:09.431 --> 15:10.865
peeler, okay?

15:10.899 --> 15:12.799
I don't need a peeler.
Thank you.

15:12.834 --> 15:16.804
- Yeah, you need a peeler.
- Actually, I don't.

15:16.838 --> 15:18.318
Where-- I'm trying
to remember where--

15:18.339 --> 15:20.674
you know how sometimes you have
something in your kitchen,

15:20.708 --> 15:22.775
you know where it is, and then all
of a sudden you can't find it?

15:22.810 --> 15:24.530
And that is what's
happened to me right now.

15:24.544 --> 15:26.845
<i>Well, you probably have so much
staff in and out of here--</i>

15:26.880 --> 15:30.516
No, no, no. I know this kitchen
like the back of my hand.

15:30.551 --> 15:33.319
<i>Oh, that's not it.</i>

15:33.353 --> 15:35.287
Okay, I don't know where--

15:36.422 --> 15:38.757
This is maddening.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.926
Do you ever have this
happen to you where you're--

15:40.994 --> 15:43.996
- I'm not here.
- <i>Okay, you're not here. I'm so sorry.</i>

15:44.030 --> 15:46.331
I'm talking to myself.
Where are you, peeler?

15:46.399 --> 15:47.800
Okay, I got it.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.336
It was in with the
napkins inexplicably.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.171
Here you go.
Use that for the carrots.

15:52.205 --> 15:54.674
Actually, I'm all done.
I'm good.

15:54.708 --> 15:57.443
- Okay.
- Tell me, don't you normally have staff

15:57.477 --> 16:00.346
- to cater for you?
- Yeah, definitely.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.982
Well, sure, but I just love
banging the pots around.

16:03.016 --> 16:05.851
<i>And I think you would say</i>
<i>that I'm a foodie.</i>

16:05.886 --> 16:07.887
So, just to flag with you,

16:07.921 --> 16:10.022
Andrew's obviously
off the table.

16:10.057 --> 16:13.692
Well, technically he's very
much at the table currently.

16:13.727 --> 16:14.793
<i>What's on the menu?</i>

16:14.828 --> 16:16.628
Herb roasted chicken

16:16.663 --> 16:19.264
and some arugula salad.

16:19.299 --> 16:21.567
<i>Catherine, do you
enjoy your folks' cooking?</i>

16:21.601 --> 16:24.770
Yeah, I love the way that
they cook the vegetables.

16:24.805 --> 16:26.839
The vegetables
are always my favorite.

16:26.873 --> 16:29.708
I just love vegetables so much.

16:29.743 --> 16:31.377
Are you working
for the vegetable lobby?

16:31.411 --> 16:33.045
I'll be right back.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.960
- I just have to grab something.
- Okay, darling.

16:34.981 --> 16:36.749
<i>Please, can
you use the peeler?</i>

16:36.783 --> 16:38.584
- <i>I'm all done with the carrots.</i>
- Oh, my God.

16:38.585 --> 16:40.319
- No, you're not.
- That's all the carrots we're gonna use.

16:40.354 --> 16:42.488
I realize there are
more carrots.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.557
<i>We don't need any more.</i>

16:44.591 --> 16:47.593
The Get Moving campaign,

16:47.628 --> 16:50.028
- which as you know I spearheaded.
- Yes.

16:50.063 --> 16:52.631
As I launched that
campaign, I discovered

16:52.665 --> 16:54.833
a local organic butcher.

16:54.867 --> 16:58.036
And...

16:58.070 --> 16:59.937
he does a lot of...

16:59.972 --> 17:02.840
grass-fed...

17:02.908 --> 17:04.642
Grass-fed cattle

17:04.675 --> 17:07.078
- and free-range chickens.
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:07.112 --> 17:10.381
<i>What's your favorite meal
that you can't wait to have?</i>

17:10.415 --> 17:14.986
I really-- I love the
roasted brussels sprouts

17:15.021 --> 17:18.257
that my mom and dad make.

17:19.792 --> 17:21.060
Yep.

17:21.095 --> 17:23.930
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>they're taking a break,</i>

17:23.964 --> 17:27.233
so this gives us a chance to come
in here, have a little chat.

17:27.268 --> 17:29.402
You never told me
that you were a vegetarian.

17:29.437 --> 17:31.757
- I told you three months ago.
- No, you didn't, Catherine.

17:31.772 --> 17:33.574
- What?
- Now that she mentions it,

17:33.608 --> 17:36.210
- I think it does sound familiar.
- Completely useless.

17:36.244 --> 17:38.378
You know what? Just
because he's a liability

17:38.412 --> 17:40.172
doesn't mean you have
to be a liability, too.

17:40.181 --> 17:41.981
Now I'm gonna tell you something.
You're eating that chicken.

17:42.016 --> 17:43.883
I am not gonna do it.
I'm a vegetarian, Mom.

17:43.917 --> 17:46.285
You swallowed chicken
your entire life.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.121
You're gonna do it again today.

17:48.155 --> 17:50.423
I swallowed your bullshit
my entire life.

17:50.457 --> 17:52.625
Okay, look, little lady, we don't
talk to your mother like that.

17:52.660 --> 17:54.127
All right, I'm just--
God damn it.

17:54.161 --> 17:56.663
- <i>Could you--</i>
<i>- Yes, yes, yes.</i>

17:56.697 --> 17:59.699
You know when you're 12
and you just get rid of it?

17:59.733 --> 18:01.434
No. Speak for yourself.

18:01.469 --> 18:03.103
It's gonna look
really bad for your mom

18:03.137 --> 18:05.372
if she doesn't know that
you're a vegetarian on TV.

18:05.406 --> 18:08.508
I'm not gonna sacrifice my
morals for her career anymore.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.511
I've done that.
It's not that bad.

18:11.546 --> 18:14.615
Well, doesn't that chicken
look just amazing, Catherine?

18:14.649 --> 18:16.717
- It looks delicious.
- Yeah.

18:16.751 --> 18:18.485
I love it when Dad cooks.

18:18.519 --> 18:21.121
<i>- A man of hidden talents.</i>
- I don't like to brag.

18:21.155 --> 18:22.722
<i>Not about cooking, anyway.</i>

18:22.756 --> 18:24.491
Okay, babe, here you go.

18:24.525 --> 18:25.758
- Wow.
- Eat that up.

18:25.793 --> 18:27.260
I just need
to reiterate with you.

18:27.294 --> 18:29.395
We have agreed
on all of these topics.

18:29.430 --> 18:31.664
And the Andrew e-mail
story was not agreed.

18:31.699 --> 18:33.032
Sweetheart, it's news.

18:33.067 --> 18:36.236
Okay? It happened today.
It's new with an S on it.

18:36.270 --> 18:38.037
That's just what news is.

18:38.072 --> 18:39.839
With all due respect,
this is not news.

18:39.907 --> 18:41.608
This is the fucking
Food Channel you got here.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.043
Okay, well, with all
due respect, fuck you.

18:44.077 --> 18:46.779
I own the edit on your
shit-show politician

18:46.814 --> 18:50.150
that you connected yourself to,
not me, you little gremlin.

18:50.184 --> 18:52.652
And has it been a happy
divorce for you, Catherine?

18:52.686 --> 18:54.787
Mmm, yeah.

18:54.822 --> 18:56.523
I think knowing that my mom

18:56.557 --> 18:58.758
had to be available
24 hours a day

18:58.793 --> 19:01.261
really taught me not to be
too demanding as a child.

19:01.296 --> 19:02.863
<i>That's true.</i>

19:02.898 --> 19:05.033
So you don't feel
parentally shortchanged, then,

19:05.067 --> 19:07.135
- do you, Catherine?
- No.

19:07.169 --> 19:08.804
I'm actually a big music fan,

19:08.838 --> 19:11.707
so I usually try to explain
my parents in terms of music.

19:11.741 --> 19:13.909
You know, musicians
sometimes are better in bands

19:13.943 --> 19:16.512
- or sometimes better solo.
- That's interesting.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.848
They're like the Beatles,
you know, better as a band

19:18.882 --> 19:21.718
or Michael Jackson,
better solo.

19:21.752 --> 19:25.188
Although not a great
parent, admittedly.

19:25.222 --> 19:28.191
Well, actually, he did okay
with his own kids.

19:28.225 --> 19:31.027
It's when other kids got
involved that it got real dicey.

19:31.062 --> 19:33.830
But, no, then he did dangle
that one from a great height.

19:33.865 --> 19:35.866
Right?
Over that railing?

19:35.900 --> 19:37.067
Ahem.

19:37.101 --> 19:38.835
You know, you cross me on this

19:38.870 --> 19:41.705
and you're never, ever gonna
get the veep on camera again.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.274
Why the fuck-- why are you
still talking to me, huh?

19:44.309 --> 19:47.189
If you'd just let someone get close
enough to fuck some sunshine into you,

19:47.212 --> 19:48.546
you'd shut your mouth!

19:48.580 --> 19:50.180
- You-- you--
- Okay, okay.

19:50.215 --> 19:51.749
You do not know
anything about me.

19:51.783 --> 19:53.550
You think that
this is easy, what I do?

19:53.585 --> 19:56.787
Yeah, having 10,000 interests
screaming in your fucking face

19:56.822 --> 20:00.023
the way that I am screaming in your
face right now all day, every day?

20:00.058 --> 20:02.359
- I am fucking good at this.
- Can we just put a filter--

20:02.393 --> 20:03.994
- Are you? This is good?
- Fuck your face, Gary.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.630
- She's good at this, you guys. Sorry.
- Fuck my face. You hear that?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.866
Antique windows.
Bring it down.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.868
- What the fuck just happened?
- Antique windows. Bring it down.

20:10.902 --> 20:13.337
Amy, let's go find
your dignity over here, okay?

20:13.372 --> 20:15.640
Get her out of here.
Fucking amateur.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.475
- All right. All right.
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.844
- No, seriously--
- No. Whoa, okay.

20:19.878 --> 20:23.314
Okay, listen,
you need to calm down.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.750
At least I am giving a shit.
You are flatlining all day.

20:25.784 --> 20:29.120
Okay, okay. But has she been
impressive at all today?

20:29.154 --> 20:31.055
Look, I've graphed
her performance, okay?

20:31.090 --> 20:32.690
Look at this. Look at
this nice little graphic.

20:32.725 --> 20:35.493
Here's time, here's her fucking career.

20:35.528 --> 20:37.161
Now maybe there should
be a little uptick

20:37.196 --> 20:39.756
because she didn't barf her food
all over the table, I don't know.

20:39.765 --> 20:42.167
So if she doesn't turn this fucking
shit-show around, guess what,

20:42.201 --> 20:44.069
I don't know which way
I'm gonna bounce.

20:44.103 --> 20:47.439
Amy, when my memaw used to
find herself getting snappy,

20:47.473 --> 20:49.274
she would sing
her favorite song.

20:49.308 --> 20:52.177
♪ Oh, I wish I were
in the land of cotton ♪

20:52.211 --> 20:54.379
♪ Old times there
were not forgotten ♪

20:54.414 --> 20:56.882
♪ Look away, look away ♪

20:56.916 --> 20:58.985
- ♪ Look away, Dixieland. ♪
- No, guys, please.

20:59.019 --> 21:00.786
Favorite family vacation?

21:00.821 --> 21:02.588
- White water rafting.
- Italy.

21:02.622 --> 21:05.090
- Disneyland.
- Which is it?

21:05.125 --> 21:07.660
No, honey, we didn't ever
go to Disneyland.

21:07.728 --> 21:10.730
Oh, no, you didn't take me.
Rosa took me with her family.

21:10.764 --> 21:12.431
Who's Rosa?

21:12.466 --> 21:13.866
- She was a...
- She was...

21:13.900 --> 21:15.601
- housekeeper.
- Housekeeper, that's right.

21:15.635 --> 21:17.436
You spent a lot of time
with your housekeeper?

21:17.504 --> 21:18.938
Yeah, she was like a--

21:18.972 --> 21:21.273
- We did go to India.
- Mmm.

21:21.374 --> 21:22.874
- India was awful.
- Hmm?

21:22.909 --> 21:24.909
I don't know why you didn't
give me this earlier.

21:24.944 --> 21:27.646
I didn't want to give it
to you before your interview.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.714
- God, you don't want any water?
- No, I've gotten good at it.

21:29.749 --> 21:32.150
Look at this. I was supposed
to be stressing my successes.

21:32.184 --> 21:34.886
Instead I'm sitting there
stuffing my face with chicken.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.589
Great stuff in there, guys.
Good stuff. Thumbs up.

21:37.657 --> 21:39.057
Andrew looks great on camera.

21:39.092 --> 21:40.292
- Get off my stairs, Jonah.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

21:40.326 --> 21:41.560
- Ma'am.
- What?

21:41.594 --> 21:43.229
I need to give you some
straight talk right now, okay?

21:43.263 --> 21:45.898
All of your worst fears about how
this day could have possibly gone...

21:45.932 --> 21:47.566
- Yeah?
- ...have come true.

21:47.601 --> 21:49.368
- Oh, my gosh.
- No, no, up here. Look at me.

21:49.403 --> 21:50.870
- You want to own this interview?
- Yeah.

21:50.938 --> 21:52.571
- Say it.
- I want to own it.

21:52.606 --> 21:54.206
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna do something big.

21:54.241 --> 21:55.641
You're gonna do something bold.

21:55.675 --> 21:57.743
And you're gonna do it
in the next five minutes.

21:57.778 --> 21:59.145
How about this? How about
I lift up my dress,

21:59.179 --> 22:00.847
give everyone a big
fat shot of my cooch?

22:00.881 --> 22:03.116
- Jesus Christ.
- Everything okay up there?

22:03.150 --> 22:05.952
- You need more pep talk?
- No, let's do it.

22:05.986 --> 22:07.620
- Did he just hear that?
- Nope.

22:07.654 --> 22:09.588
Use the Force, ma'am.

22:09.656 --> 22:11.490
I don't even know
what that means.

22:11.558 --> 22:12.557
Big and bold.
What do you mean?

22:12.592 --> 22:13.992
Like a medley from
"Okla"-fucking-"homa"?

22:14.027 --> 22:15.327
Look, I tried
to wake her up, okay?

22:15.361 --> 22:17.629
I have no choice but to
be the fucking curveball.

22:19.866 --> 22:22.267
- Ahem.
- Fantastic. Okay.

22:23.703 --> 22:26.738
<i>Let's roll cameras. Sound.</i>

22:28.006 --> 22:31.042
<i>So, what a
lovely afternoon</i>

22:31.077 --> 22:33.578
I have gotten to spend
with the Second Family.

22:33.612 --> 22:34.879
How about that?
Yeah.

22:34.913 --> 22:36.414
And, Catherine, would you vote

22:36.482 --> 22:38.950
for your parents to get
back together again?

22:38.984 --> 22:40.652
No, no, no.
This way, I get a Christmas

22:40.686 --> 22:42.655
and a birthday present
off of each of them.

22:44.057 --> 22:45.925
Catherine, how does
all this affect

22:45.992 --> 22:47.993
how you approach relationships?

22:48.028 --> 22:51.196
Not terribly much. I'm in a very
different phase of my life.

22:51.231 --> 22:53.365
You know, my boyfriend
and I are very young

22:53.400 --> 22:55.667
and not really talking
about marriage.

22:55.702 --> 22:57.836
And this would be Rahim?

22:59.606 --> 23:00.906
Yes.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.541
<i>That is</i>
<i>an interesting name.</i>

23:03.576 --> 23:05.777
- <i>Is that Indian?</i>
- It's Iranian.

23:05.811 --> 23:10.482
- <i>Iranian?</i>
- It's second generation American Persian.

23:10.516 --> 23:12.384
Calling Tel Aviv now.

23:12.418 --> 23:15.186
And has he been
welcomed into your home?

23:15.221 --> 23:16.621
No.

23:16.655 --> 23:19.391
Only because it's just--
it's a casual thing

23:19.425 --> 23:21.493
and it's actually ended.

23:21.528 --> 23:23.162
Really? I'm sorry to
hear that, honey.

23:23.229 --> 23:24.863
<i>That's okay.</i>

23:24.898 --> 23:26.799
Speaking of relationships--

23:26.833 --> 23:28.934
Andrew, I'm sorry,
I simply have to ask you

23:29.035 --> 23:31.103
about your relationship
with lobbyist Jim Melita

23:31.137 --> 23:35.141
and the implication that you offered
access to the vice president.

23:35.175 --> 23:37.710
Yeah, um, it's--

23:37.744 --> 23:41.347
um, in a word--

23:43.417 --> 23:45.551
come on.

23:45.585 --> 23:47.986
Perhaps it's possible

23:48.021 --> 23:51.757
that I have overplayed my hand.

23:51.792 --> 23:53.793
<i>Well, I think
it's safe to say</i>

23:53.827 --> 23:56.662
that Andrew overreached

23:56.697 --> 23:59.466
and just said something silly.
Yeah.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.902
I suppose that
the vice president

24:01.936 --> 24:04.271
would also agree that

24:04.305 --> 24:06.406
when she said
she was in the loop

24:06.440 --> 24:08.475
over national security,

24:08.509 --> 24:11.344
that also may have been
an bit of an exaggeration.

24:13.014 --> 24:16.716
I'm actually not sure that those
two situations are comparable.

24:16.751 --> 24:18.218
I believe that they are.

24:18.286 --> 24:21.087
And insomuch as you
refuse to comment

24:21.122 --> 24:23.890
on the spy allegations
or the hostage situation

24:23.925 --> 24:25.759
until the investigation
is complete,

24:25.826 --> 24:27.827
I, too, would like to refrain

24:27.862 --> 24:30.463
until I find out
just exactly what it is

24:30.497 --> 24:33.132
I'm accused of having said
or not said.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.402
You do understand that sounds
like you're playing for time

24:36.436 --> 24:39.605
and actually
are hiding something?

24:42.075 --> 24:43.916
I'm sorry, was that a
question for me or Selina?

24:43.943 --> 24:46.111
I think that question
is for me.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.182
I want to talk about the spy.

24:50.216 --> 24:51.984
The CIA operative.

24:52.019 --> 24:54.220
- No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:54.254 --> 24:58.224
There was a miscommunication
for which I want to apologize

24:58.259 --> 25:00.193
on behalf of
the administration.

25:00.228 --> 25:03.997
You know, the intention
was never to mislead

25:04.032 --> 25:06.700
the American people,
but that was its effect.

25:06.734 --> 25:10.436
- Shit.
- <i>And for that, I really am truly sorry.</i>

25:10.471 --> 25:12.906
But I am saying
that I had full knowledge

25:12.940 --> 25:14.774
of the spy's status.

25:14.842 --> 25:16.843
- But she didn't.
- I know.

25:16.877 --> 25:19.312
Madam Vice President,
this is quite an admission.

25:19.347 --> 25:23.050
Mm-hmm. I have taken
on a role now,

25:23.084 --> 25:25.686
an important role
in national security

25:25.720 --> 25:29.189
and I take great pride
in that responsibility.

25:29.224 --> 25:32.359
Now, sometimes you have to act.

25:32.427 --> 25:34.294
Always you have to listen.

25:34.329 --> 25:37.965
Because in politics,

25:37.999 --> 25:41.769
a backbone and a heart

25:41.803 --> 25:44.271
are only as good

25:44.305 --> 25:45.773
as your ears.

25:48.510 --> 25:51.645
And my ears are my livelihood.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.914
<i>Okay, that's
our segment, guys.</i>

25:53.948 --> 25:56.049
<i>That's it. Great. Good.</i>

25:56.083 --> 25:57.417
That's good.

25:57.451 --> 26:00.953
Madam Vice President, that
was an amazing interview.

26:00.987 --> 26:02.421
Well, thank you very much.

26:02.455 --> 26:03.856
You're gonna take
the spotlight back

26:03.890 --> 26:05.810
from the end of the shutdown,
I'll tell you that.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.326
- We'll see.
- Best of luck, Andrew.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.762
- Good to meet you.
- Good luck with all the...

26:09.796 --> 26:11.697
<i>Way to go, Team Meyer.</i>

26:11.732 --> 26:13.867
How about it?
Right?

26:13.901 --> 26:15.569
- Congratulations.
- Honestly, that was--

26:15.603 --> 26:17.037
that was something else, Mom.

26:17.071 --> 26:19.206
I'm really sorry
that I brought up Rahim.

26:19.241 --> 26:20.875
I know you didn't
want me to do that.

26:20.909 --> 26:22.844
You know what? I'm sorry you
had to dump him on the air.

26:22.878 --> 26:25.380
Notes about the interview. Just want
to help you keep an eye out for those.

26:25.414 --> 26:27.282
- Get out of here.
- How are you doing?

26:27.316 --> 26:29.951
I spewed out so much bullshit,
I'm gonna need a mint.

26:29.986 --> 26:31.720
- A fucking mint.
- Do you want a mint?

26:31.754 --> 26:33.322
- I'll get you a mint.
- No, I don't mean it.

26:33.356 --> 26:36.425
I'm just gonna head back if
anybody needs me-- West Wing.

26:36.459 --> 26:39.327
- No one does, Jonah.
- No one needs you, Jonah.

26:39.362 --> 26:41.596
<i>- Amy.</i>
- Yes, ma'am?

26:41.631 --> 26:43.665
- Did Andrew leave?
- He's gone.

26:43.699 --> 26:45.367
Can you see if
he's still out there?

26:45.401 --> 26:47.903
- He just left a jacket.
- Oh, your jacket is up here.

26:47.937 --> 26:50.705
- His jacket.
- I'll wait here?

26:50.740 --> 26:53.241
- Ma'am, do you need--
- <i>No, it's fine.</i>

26:53.276 --> 26:55.910
<i>I know where his stuff is.</i>

26:55.945 --> 26:57.746
Are they gonna...

26:57.780 --> 26:59.814
it's like a victory fuck?

26:59.849 --> 27:01.383
He better come down.

27:01.417 --> 27:04.520
Is he coming back down?
Do we need to wait for him?

27:04.554 --> 27:06.088
<i>- We got it.</i>
<i>- We're good.</i>

27:06.122 --> 27:08.322
Okay.

27:08.357 --> 27:11.759
- Where are my parents?
- Um...

27:11.793 --> 27:13.494
Did my dad leave?

27:13.529 --> 27:15.830
They're having--
they're having a talk.

27:15.864 --> 27:18.732
- They're having a talk upstairs.
- A talk upstairs?

27:18.767 --> 27:21.168
- They might be getting you something.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
