Shouldn't she be wearing a diaper
or something?

17:07.382 --> 17:10.300
Oh God, no, no. We pee in the toilet.

17:10.385 --> 17:12.262
She's one years old.

17:12.345 --> 17:15.013
Do you think my legs are too white
to wear a skirt?

17:15.098 --> 17:16.516
No.

17:17.099 --> 17:19.352
You think I'm fat, don't you?

17:19.935 --> 17:21.896
No. I mean, not at all.

17:24.065 --> 17:25.525
Once you have a baby,

17:25.608 --> 17:28.403
your body isn't as tight as it used to be.

17:28.486 --> 17:31.698
Not everybody can stay
as tiny and skinny as you.

18:21.748 --> 18:23.416
I need to just rest.

18:23.499 --> 18:25.752
Yeah, I don't really know
how to do that kind of stuff.

18:25.835 --> 18:27.253
Oh, for fuck's sake!

18:30.006 --> 18:32.091
There, there's your tip.

18:33.468 --> 18:35.821
[Carolyn] Has anyone ever
tipped you a hundred bucks before?

18:35.845 --> 18:37.430
Uh, no!

18:38.056 --> 18:40.433
Now put some fucking makeup on my face.

18:45.146 --> 18:46.522
- This thing?
- Mm-hmm.

18:50.026 --> 18:51.402
I need you.

18:52.654 --> 18:54.030
[baby cooing]

18:54.113 --> 18:55.615
[Tallulah] Oh shit! Uh...

18:56.074 --> 18:59.452
Maybe that'll calm her down. [laughing]

19:01.329 --> 19:03.081
Now put some shoes on my feet.

19:07.085 --> 19:11.089
Oh, uh, she... she had an accident.

19:11.172 --> 19:14.717
No! Oh God, don't say that!

19:14.801 --> 19:16.636
[heavy sigh] This is too much for me!

19:16.719 --> 19:18.137
What is wrong with her?

19:18.221 --> 19:19.347
She's... she's little!

19:19.430 --> 19:22.016
- She knows better!
- I mean, it's just pee.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.686
No, she's supposed to go on the potty.

19:24.769 --> 19:27.772
I have the book.
My neighbor gave me the training book.

19:27.855 --> 19:29.274
She knows what to do,

19:29.357 --> 19:30.817
she just doesn't want to do it!

19:30.900 --> 19:33.403
God, this is just so hard.

19:33.486 --> 19:35.947
Nobody tells you
how hard it's going to be.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.573
Everyone acts like it's normal

19:37.657 --> 19:39.367
because everybody does it, but it's not.

19:39.450 --> 19:42.287
And I see all these women on TV
and on the street,

19:42.370 --> 19:47.208
and they're doing it, and I can't...

19:47.625 --> 19:50.878
[sniffles] I don't know h-how!

19:56.676 --> 19:58.052
I gotta go!

19:58.553 --> 20:00.638
[sniffles]

20:01.556 --> 20:03.141
Do I look fat?

20:04.225 --> 20:05.059
No!

20:05.143 --> 20:06.811
You think he'll want me?

20:06.894 --> 20:07.895
[Tallulah] Uh...

20:07.979 --> 20:09.480
Give me my purse.

20:14.110 --> 20:15.653
You know what?

20:15.737 --> 20:18.072
You two should go swimming
in the pool today.

20:18.156 --> 20:19.240
That would be fun.

20:19.324 --> 20:21.826
- It's cold.
- No, it'll be fun!

20:21.909 --> 20:24.912
Here you go, some bathing suits.

20:24.996 --> 20:25.996
Oh!

20:26.039 --> 20:28.416
[laughs] How cute!

20:28.750 --> 20:31.377
And now, something for you too!

20:31.461 --> 20:34.964
Hmm, a matching sarong and a hat.

20:35.048 --> 20:36.341
Oh, and some flip-flops.

20:36.424 --> 20:38.926
Yeah, it's really kind of too cold.

20:39.010 --> 20:41.095
No, Maddy wants to go swimming.

20:41.179 --> 20:42.180
Don't you, baby?

20:44.807 --> 20:46.142
You can have fun.

20:49.896 --> 20:51.314
Do I look great?

20:53.107 --> 20:54.317
You look great.

21:00.198 --> 21:01.657
I love you.

21:02.575 --> 21:04.410
[Carolyn] You're gonna have a great time.

21:07.914 --> 21:08.914
[door closes]

21:10.625 --> 21:11.751
Psycho.

21:29.936 --> 21:32.522
[baby coos]

21:36.234 --> 21:37.568
You can't have that.

21:39.445 --> 21:40.321
[baby babbles]

21:40.405 --> 21:42.240
Take this crab instead.

21:49.038 --> 21:52.166
[baby babbles]

21:54.127 --> 21:55.753
Yeah, I'm not cleaning that up.

21:55.837 --> 21:57.922
- [baby babbles]
- You clean it up.

22:22.488 --> 22:23.948
That's my money, kid.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.543
[baby squeals]

23:20.963 --> 23:22.256
Don't poop.

23:24.258 --> 23:25.259
Don't poop.

23:26.260 --> 23:29.680
[singing nonsense words]

23:39.273 --> 23:41.734
[background conversation]

23:41.817 --> 23:43.236
Your mom's home.

23:50.326 --> 23:51.327
Thank you.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.620
[kisses]

23:52.995 --> 23:54.956
[laughter]

24:00.503 --> 24:03.881
- You can probably go, yeah?
- Yes ma'am.

24:03.965 --> 24:06.050
Hey, baby.

24:06.133 --> 24:08.552
[baby whimpers]

24:11.222 --> 24:12.974
He didn't want me.

24:16.852 --> 24:18.104
He didn't want me.

24:23.025 --> 24:24.610
Uh...

24:25.736 --> 24:26.737
[Tallulah] Hey.

24:28.155 --> 24:29.323
Hey.

24:32.243 --> 24:33.494
Hey.

24:34.745 --> 24:36.497
Dude, come on.

24:38.791 --> 24:39.834
[sighs]

24:59.854 --> 25:02.440
[baby crying]

25:09.864 --> 25:11.824
I don't know what to tell you, kid.

25:11.907 --> 25:14.076
[baby crying]

26:05.461 --> 26:07.004
[horn blares]

26:07.088 --> 26:09.256
[baby crying]

26:53.008 --> 26:54.677
[crying stops]

28:05.539 --> 28:08.042
[hum of hair dryer]

28:36.570 --> 28:37.738
[sighs]

28:43.202 --> 28:44.870
Oh, God...

28:53.587 --> 28:54.922
Maddy?

28:57.591 --> 28:58.884
Maddy!

28:58.968 --> 29:00.052
Madison!

29:00.886 --> 29:01.887
Madison!

29:02.805 --> 29:04.098
Somebody help me.

29:06.350 --> 29:07.852
Somebody help me.

29:07.935 --> 29:09.520
[gasping]

29:11.564 --> 29:12.690
Oh, God!

29:14.525 --> 29:15.359
Somebody!

29:15.442 --> 29:17.403
[roar of vehicles]

29:19.488 --> 29:21.699
[siren in the background]

29:48.142 --> 29:49.142
[sighs]

30:17.004 --> 30:19.340
Margo. Hi!

30:20.257 --> 30:21.800
Vera! Ed!

30:21.884 --> 30:23.636
[Vera] Hey, what are you doing here?

30:23.719 --> 30:25.137
I have a book signing.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.098
Oh, you should have told us,
we would have come.

30:28.182 --> 30:30.601
Is it the marriage book or something new?

30:31.060 --> 30:33.479
The marriage book. I'm the expert.

30:33.562 --> 30:35.105
[chuckles]

30:36.482 --> 30:39.693
Listen, I know we haven't been the best...

30:39.777 --> 30:41.737
We did call you about that dinner.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.782
It's just... it's been
really difficult for us

30:44.865 --> 30:48.577
to navigate the whole...

30:48.661 --> 30:51.455
and Stephen was really struggling there
for awhile.

30:52.873 --> 30:55.668
Well, so good that he has you.

30:56.377 --> 30:57.753
Excuse me, I'm running late.

31:01.715 --> 31:02.967
She's lost a lot of weight.

31:03.509 --> 31:05.886
[music playing over radio]

31:24.697 --> 31:26.532
[Mother] Okay, you're okay.

31:27.282 --> 31:28.492
Here we go.

31:28.867 --> 31:31.036
Some bottles? Bottles?

31:33.414 --> 31:35.582
- How much does he weigh?
- She...

31:37.501 --> 31:39.253
- Really?
- Really.

31:39.753 --> 31:40.963
Sorry.

32:02.192 --> 32:05.112
[baby crying]

32:10.451 --> 32:12.453
What? Have you never seen
a baby's ass before?

32:12.536 --> 32:15.122
[baby crying]

32:19.793 --> 32:21.086
Shh! Shh!

32:21.754 --> 32:24.339
[baby shrieks]

32:28.343 --> 32:30.095
Any questions? Yes?

32:30.179 --> 32:33.599
[Woman] You mentioned that marriage
is the cornerstone of patriarchal power.

32:34.099 --> 32:37.728
I didn't, that was the basis
for the feminist argument in the '70s.

32:37.811 --> 32:39.730
Many people have argued the opposite,

32:39.813 --> 32:42.900
but even in a love-based marriage,

32:42.983 --> 32:45.944
each sex is capable of
harnessing the productive

32:46.028 --> 32:48.238
and reproductive skills of the other.

32:48.322 --> 32:50.407
Couldn't it be that people
didn't want to be alone?

32:52.993 --> 32:55.370
Well, that would have made for
a shorter book.

32:55.454 --> 32:56.914
[audience members laugh]

33:10.469 --> 33:11.469
Hey.

33:13.972 --> 33:16.183
Buddy? Hey!

33:19.353 --> 33:21.647
Hey! Oh, my God!

33:23.023 --> 33:25.192
Oh, my God, no!

33:25.275 --> 33:26.276
No!

33:26.360 --> 33:27.444
No!

33:35.494 --> 33:38.747
[crying] Oh, my God!

33:48.465 --> 33:50.676
[sobs]

33:50.759 --> 33:51.885
[doorbell buzzes]

34:03.355 --> 34:04.481
Yes?

34:05.315 --> 34:07.359
[Manuel] <i> Mrs. Mooney,</i>
<i>that girl, she's here.</i>

34:08.860 --> 34:10.195
Send her up!

34:14.741 --> 34:19.538
Oh! I'm sorry.

34:24.751 --> 34:26.587
[knock on door]

34:32.676 --> 34:36.054
I need to find Nico. Please!

34:36.263 --> 34:38.306
Look, I'm his girlfriend, Tallulah.

34:40.684 --> 34:41.726
Whose baby is this?

34:46.231 --> 34:47.274
It's his.

35:02.748 --> 35:03.790
How old is she?

35:03.874 --> 35:05.250
She's one.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.127
[Margo] She's big for one.

35:08.128 --> 35:09.129
She's almost two.

35:10.464 --> 35:11.984
Oh, can you take that out of her hand?

35:12.591 --> 35:13.634
Oh, yeah.

35:17.012 --> 35:18.847
- I got it.
- What's her name?

35:18.931 --> 35:21.892
Margaret. We named her after you.

35:23.477 --> 35:25.896
Never liked the name Margaret.
That's why I go by Margo.

35:25.979 --> 35:27.356
Well, we call her Maggie,

35:27.439 --> 35:30.067
so really, Maggie's her name.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.110
- [Margo] Can you just...
- She's all right.

35:32.986 --> 35:34.363
She's fine, she's like...

35:35.155 --> 35:38.242
a little... I'll put her in gymnastics
when she's older, for sure.

35:39.117 --> 35:41.328
[Tallulah] Oh, my God!
I have something for you.

35:43.914 --> 35:45.415
Nico said you wanted us to use it.

35:49.294 --> 35:51.614
If I wanted you to use it,
I would've given you permission.

35:51.672 --> 35:53.090
This is called stealing.

35:53.924 --> 35:55.300
You could have closed the account.

35:56.885 --> 35:59.346
And how else could I keep track of my son?

35:59.596 --> 36:01.682
I have a record of every
gas station in every city.

36:01.765 --> 36:04.643
You've been all over.
Can you please put that down?

36:06.019 --> 36:07.187
Sorry.

36:08.522 --> 36:10.691
[Margo] I had no idea it was with a baby.

36:12.025 --> 36:13.443
Why didn't he call me?

36:14.361 --> 36:16.280
I don't know. He just...

36:16.363 --> 36:18.198
he said that he wanted to come home.

36:18.282 --> 36:19.449
Oh, now he wants to come home

36:19.533 --> 36:21.743
now that he's knocked up
some homeless girl!

36:21.827 --> 36:25.330
Hey! I am not homeless, okay?

36:25.414 --> 36:28.458
I'm just sleeping in my van,
but a window's broken,

36:28.542 --> 36:30.377
and it's not a safe place for a baby.

36:30.460 --> 36:33.213
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you had one!

36:34.214 --> 36:35.590
Do you want to hold her?

36:36.008 --> 36:38.135
No! I'm not stupid.

36:44.975 --> 36:47.436
One night, one!

36:48.061 --> 36:49.938
This house is full of
very expensive things

36:50.022 --> 36:51.732
and sharp corners, so you hold on to her.

36:51.815 --> 36:56.403
And if you take anything from me,
I will find you.

36:57.237 --> 36:58.989
[voices over police radio]

36:59.406 --> 37:01.384
There's no way that this woman
worked for the hotel.

37:01.408 --> 37:02.659
She was housekeeping.

37:02.743 --> 37:03.952
We have babysitting services.

37:04.036 --> 37:06.621
You would think you people
have protections against this.

37:06.705 --> 37:08.623
[Carolyn] I pay enough for my room.

37:08.707 --> 37:11.126
Was she wearing a hotel uniform?

37:12.210 --> 37:13.045
[in low voice] Yes.

37:13.128 --> 37:14.421
Are you sure?

37:16.006 --> 37:18.342
- Can we get her one to look at?
- Yes, sir.

37:20.844 --> 37:22.596
[radio] <i> Clear, boss, we got nothin'.</i>

37:23.472 --> 37:25.557
Okay, move it out. Level one mobilization.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.310
Tell Central
to start making notifications.

37:28.602 --> 37:29.478
What is that?

37:29.561 --> 37:33.315
Missing Persons, possibly the FBI,
in case she crossed state lines.

37:33.398 --> 37:36.068
[whispers] What if she tries to sell her?

37:36.151 --> 37:39.029
She's white, she's pretty.
People would want her.

37:39.112 --> 37:40.280
I don't think that's likely.

37:41.782 --> 37:43.033
One thing at a time, Ms. Ford.

37:43.116 --> 37:44.409
Or, is it Mrs.?

37:45.952 --> 37:46.953
Yes.

37:47.037 --> 37:48.455
We need to notify your husband.

37:49.915 --> 37:51.958
Oh, he's in London on business.

37:52.042 --> 37:53.668
We'll be asking him some questions,

37:53.752 --> 37:55.879
and we'll be asking you
some questions as well.

37:57.130 --> 37:59.883
- It's not my fault.
- No one thinks it is.

37:59.966 --> 38:02.636
If my baby's hurt,
I don't know what I'll do.

38:05.138 --> 38:06.681
- Elevator and the hallway?
- Yeah.

38:06.765 --> 38:09.226
Put this out to the local news stations
and papers.

38:09.309 --> 38:12.270
News! Haven't I been through enough?

38:13.814 --> 38:15.690
Do you want to find your child?

38:37.504 --> 38:38.672
[whispers] Thanks.

38:40.215 --> 38:41.758
Did you use my toothbrush?

38:43.552 --> 38:45.804
- Maybe.
- Because it was wet.

38:46.304 --> 38:47.304
Sorry.

38:47.347 --> 38:48.765
[Margo] Don't you have one?

38:48.849 --> 38:50.142
Why? Is that gross?

38:50.767 --> 38:52.102
Yes!

38:54.521 --> 38:56.314
Is she all right sleeping there?

38:58.191 --> 38:59.443
Yeah.

39:02.988 --> 39:04.781
Her breathing is so fast.

39:06.032 --> 39:07.576
Is that bad?

39:07.659 --> 39:08.659
No.

39:18.253 --> 39:20.881
Isn't she just the coolest,

39:21.381 --> 39:24.009
weirdest little thing you've ever seen?

39:24.092 --> 39:25.469
Yes.

39:26.428 --> 39:29.139
She's just so little.

39:29.222 --> 39:33.477
She's got those, like,
tiny little toenails,

39:34.519 --> 39:36.146
it just blows my mind.

39:38.315 --> 39:39.542
Then they grow up and hate you,

39:39.566 --> 39:41.693
and it really blows your mind.

39:44.154 --> 39:45.405
Yeah.

39:48.408 --> 39:50.952
Well, good night.

39:51.036 --> 39:52.662
[Tallulah] Good night, Mommy.

39:52.746 --> 39:55.040
Don't use my toothbrush again.

40:06.301 --> 40:08.929
[juicer whirring]

40:24.945 --> 40:26.279
Oh!

40:33.912 --> 40:35.121
What are you doing?

40:35.622 --> 40:36.498
Juicing!

40:36.581 --> 40:38.083
Where did you find that juicer?

40:38.166 --> 40:40.627
Oh, up in the cabinet, still in the box.

40:42.295 --> 40:44.506
Please stop that noise.

40:45.507 --> 40:46.508
Dude.

40:47.092 --> 40:50.262
The guy at the bodega
sold me 16 for a dollar.

40:50.345 --> 40:53.348
They were four for a dollar,
but I talked him down,

40:53.431 --> 40:55.517
or we talked him down, that's right.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.019
I'm gonna make a lemonade
stand on the back of Jim.

40:58.103 --> 40:59.729
- Jim?
- Yeah, it's my van.

40:59.813 --> 41:01.982
Dude, freshly squeezed lemonade.

41:02.065 --> 41:04.192
Are you kidding me? I'm gonna kill.

41:06.486 --> 41:09.030
No, stop that sound. Tallulah, stop it.

41:11.825 --> 41:13.326
[Tallulah] Oh, shit.

41:14.995 --> 41:15.995
[sighs]

41:17.080 --> 41:18.081
Has she eaten?

41:18.957 --> 41:20.584
- Not really.
- All right, I think I...

41:20.667 --> 41:23.169
Oh, God, got some cereal or something.

41:27.966 --> 41:29.134
[Margo] Here you go.

41:29.217 --> 41:31.261
No milk or anything, huh? Just like that?

41:32.095 --> 41:33.722
Are you breast-feeding?

41:33.805 --> 41:35.432
She has a bottle.

41:35.515 --> 41:37.142
Why don't you make her one?

41:37.225 --> 41:39.311
And she needs a change of clothes.

41:39.394 --> 41:41.313
Where are her things?

41:41.396 --> 41:42.689
Stolen.

41:42.772 --> 41:45.609
Some asshole broke into my van,
stole my suitcase.

41:45.692 --> 41:47.902
I got some stuff in the stroller, but...

41:48.695 --> 41:50.614
- Does she have a toy?
- I mean, a couple.

41:50.697 --> 41:54.242
But she doesn't like toys.
She likes things like shoes, pans and

41:54.326 --> 41:56.703
stuff like this.
Do you know what I mean?

41:57.037 --> 41:58.288
Do you have any sugar?

42:03.084 --> 42:07.088
Lemonade! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

42:08.256 --> 42:11.843
Who wants some lemonade?
You want lemonade?

42:11.926 --> 42:14.679
I know you want lemonade.
Come on, it's organic.

42:14.763 --> 42:16.473
It's organic. You sir, you want some.

42:16.556 --> 42:18.642
You need it. Hydration is important.

42:18.725 --> 42:20.644
Looking at your skin, you need it.

42:20.727 --> 42:22.145
Lemonade, do you want lemonade?

42:22.228 --> 42:24.064
Discount, I'll give you a discount.

42:24.147 --> 42:27.025
You'll enjoy it. Yes. Yes.

42:32.238 --> 42:33.573
[baby whimpers]

42:33.657 --> 42:35.200
You cannot do this here.

42:35.283 --> 42:37.118
Oh, really? Well, what's this?

42:37.202 --> 42:39.287
As if the neighbors don't have enough
to talk about.

42:39.371 --> 42:41.289
Get in the apartment,
this is embarrassing.

42:41.373 --> 42:44.000
No one's even watching, who cares?
Cool down.

42:44.084 --> 42:45.710
The doorman is staring.

42:47.045 --> 42:49.506
The doorman is staring
because he's thirsty.

42:49.589 --> 42:50.507
Lu, no.

42:50.590 --> 42:52.300
It's hot out, dude.

42:54.052 --> 42:57.597
Here, Manny! Enjoy.

42:59.683 --> 43:01.142
Oh, my God.

43:01.226 --> 43:02.226
[horn blares]

43:07.440 --> 43:10.819
Hold on, it's coming up.
I've got the little girl exiting.

43:15.115 --> 43:17.367
- There you go.
- Stop, stop.

43:20.620 --> 43:24.833
Turn around, turn around.

43:26.418 --> 43:27.961
Thank you.

43:29.629 --> 43:31.464
That's her, that's her.

43:32.257 --> 43:34.134
Oh, damn it.

43:34.217 --> 43:36.386
- [Tallulah] Can I do anything?
- No.

43:36.469 --> 43:40.348
I'm fine, just...

43:40.432 --> 43:42.225
stop watching me.

43:42.392 --> 43:44.745
[Tallulah] Do you always get
this stressed out when you cook?

43:44.769 --> 43:47.230
Well, I don't usually have an audience.

43:49.190 --> 43:51.609
Do you have a turtle or frog or something?

43:51.693 --> 43:54.487
- No.
- Just a tank?

43:54.571 --> 43:56.322
It died, years ago.

43:56.406 --> 43:57.907
I don't know why I still keep it.

43:57.991 --> 43:59.117
Oh! Oh!

43:59.200 --> 44:00.535
Here, let me help.

44:05.123 --> 44:06.666
Were you raised by wolves?

44:06.750 --> 44:08.293
I wish.

44:08.918 --> 44:11.921
Okay, stop. Get out of the kitchen.

44:12.005 --> 44:14.090
Take her, and wash your hands
while you're at it.

44:14.674 --> 44:17.969
[mouth full] Okay. Come on, munchkin.

44:31.149 --> 44:32.275
Chicken's dry.

44:32.776 --> 44:35.612
At least it's not dirty like the broccoli.

44:39.407 --> 44:41.826
You might want to cut that up for her.

44:43.369 --> 44:44.621
Hmm.

44:44.704 --> 44:46.456
Those books have your name on them.

44:46.539 --> 44:47.749
I wrote them.

44:47.832 --> 44:48.832
What are they about?

44:49.918 --> 44:52.837
The family unit,
from a historical perspective.

44:52.921 --> 44:56.216
My last book was about cultural shifts
in the perception of marriage.

44:56.299 --> 44:57.383
It's fucked up.

44:58.510 --> 45:00.094
Yes, in a nutshell.

45:02.055 --> 45:03.723
Is that how you afford all this?

45:05.099 --> 45:05.934
All this?

45:06.017 --> 45:09.062
Well, the furniture
and the fancy paintings and...

45:09.562 --> 45:12.440
Hmm. Most of it's my husband's.

45:12.899 --> 45:14.859
The fancy paintings are his.

45:14.943 --> 45:16.486
Why didn't you change it?

45:16.945 --> 45:18.613
I can't. This is faculty housing.

45:18.696 --> 45:20.198
No one can know he's not here.

45:20.281 --> 45:22.200
Come on. Are they really checking?

45:25.787 --> 45:28.498
It would drive me crazy,
living with someone else's stuff.

45:28.581 --> 45:31.125
I mean, it's one thing
if it's your own shitty art.

45:32.502 --> 45:33.795
You're very rude.

45:35.255 --> 45:36.589
[sighs] I'll stop talking.

45:46.140 --> 45:47.684
I hate the paintings.

45:48.893 --> 45:49.894
Happy?

45:52.564 --> 45:55.024
[distant siren]

47:34.624 --> 47:37.251
[buzzer]

47:37.335 --> 47:40.213
[engine revs]

47:44.217 --> 47:45.718
Fuck!

47:53.267 --> 47:56.145
[knocking]

48:09.033 --> 48:10.034
[Margo] Were you leaving?

48:10.118 --> 48:12.870
I'm not used to sleeping in a bed.
I'm comfortable in the van.

48:12.954 --> 48:15.581
It's not safe to leave a baby alone.
Didn't anyone tell you?

48:15.665 --> 48:18.084
I'm figuring out this whole "mommy" thing
on my own.

48:18.167 --> 48:20.044
- You have no idea what you're doing.
- I know.

48:20.128 --> 48:22.088
I cannot believe this kid
has made it this far.

48:22.171 --> 48:24.173
I have half a mind to call Child Services.

48:24.257 --> 48:25.091
Well, fuck!

48:25.174 --> 48:26.926
I've never done this before, okay?

48:27.009 --> 48:28.886
You ask about these things, Tallulah.

48:28.970 --> 48:30.930
No one knows how to do it, but you ask.

48:31.013 --> 48:33.057
Well, I've never had anyone to ask.

48:36.310 --> 48:37.437
[children laughing]

48:42.150 --> 48:43.484
[whistling]

48:44.360 --> 48:47.321
[whistling]

48:52.243 --> 48:55.121
Well, don't eat the grass.
Don't eat the grass.

48:56.664 --> 48:59.208
I guess I shouldn't knock it
before I try it.

49:02.295 --> 49:03.546
It's not good.

49:05.590 --> 49:06.924
Don't do it.

49:08.217 --> 49:09.469
What's your plan, Lu?

49:11.971 --> 49:13.723
Lie in the grass?

49:13.806 --> 49:15.808
I mean, with your life.

49:18.603 --> 49:19.645
Did you have a plan?

49:19.729 --> 49:21.230
Yes, of course I did.

49:21.314 --> 49:22.899
And what was that?

49:23.649 --> 49:26.736
Well, I suppose it changed.

49:26.819 --> 49:30.656
I was finishing my thesis
when I got pregnant.

49:31.073 --> 49:34.660
All of our friends were these
hyper-academic, ambitious people

49:34.744 --> 49:37.747
and Stephen was right there
at the center of it all.

49:38.414 --> 49:40.291
I suppose it wasn't cool to admit it,

49:40.374 --> 49:43.753
because it was painfully conventional,

49:43.836 --> 49:49.050
but I really just wanted to be married,

49:51.552 --> 49:53.221
and to have a family.

49:53.304 --> 49:54.806
My plan was to be a mom.

49:55.306 --> 49:56.516
How did that work out?

49:57.850 --> 49:59.852
I guess it didn't. They both left me.

50:02.814 --> 50:04.732
[Tallulah] You're naive,
that's your problem.

50:04.816 --> 50:06.818
[Margo] Don't say that. I hate that word.

50:07.985 --> 50:10.363
Your plan depended on other people.

50:10.446 --> 50:13.991
People suck, and they'll
disappoint you every time.

50:14.075 --> 50:15.618
That is no way to live.

50:16.244 --> 50:18.704
Look, I'm not saying
that we should go around,

50:18.788 --> 50:22.291
dicking each other over
all the time, but...

50:22.875 --> 50:24.252
like, look...

50:25.920 --> 50:27.213
When I was six,

50:27.296 --> 50:31.425
my mom took me
to this weird apartment building,

50:31.509 --> 50:35.054
and she sat me up on the stoop,
and told me to wait.

50:35.555 --> 50:38.599
And she was just gonna go run
some errands,

50:38.683 --> 50:40.059
and come back.

50:40.810 --> 50:43.271
And, um...

50:43.354 --> 50:47.191
I sat there for hours,
and it got really cold,

50:47.275 --> 50:50.236
and then, this old Buick pulls up

50:50.319 --> 50:53.823
and this tall skinny guy gets out.

50:53.906 --> 50:56.367
A guy I'd never even seen before,

50:57.410 --> 51:01.330
and he was like, "Hey, I'm your dad

51:01.414 --> 51:03.916
and you're gonna come home with me."

51:07.628 --> 51:09.672
Um... and then I never... I...

51:11.465 --> 51:13.092
I never saw her again.

51:15.928 --> 51:18.514
But I wouldn't have cared
if I hadn't needed her.

51:18.598 --> 51:19.932
So...

51:21.976 --> 51:24.395
I just think it's better to not be needed.

51:26.397 --> 51:28.024
She needs you.

51:28.107 --> 51:29.775
She doesn't know any better!

51:30.067 --> 51:33.195
You cannot keep living
in your van, it's dangerous.

51:33.279 --> 51:35.031
- You live alone.
- It's not the same!

51:35.114 --> 51:37.867
You're out on the street,
you could be robbed or attacked!

51:37.950 --> 51:39.702
You could slip in the shower,

51:39.785 --> 51:41.871
choke on an egg roll or something.

51:42.371 --> 51:43.372
Who would find you?

51:43.456 --> 51:45.207
No one. For days!

51:46.375 --> 51:48.255
My cleaning lady
would have a horrible surprise.

51:48.294 --> 51:50.004
Yes! That poor woman!

51:50.087 --> 51:51.631
- Yeah.
- Don't do that to someone.

51:55.426 --> 51:58.012
Thank God there's gravity, right?

51:58.095 --> 51:59.889
What do you mean?

51:59.972 --> 52:02.475
Hmm, like just sticking us
here on the ground.

52:04.143 --> 52:06.938
Like some magnet at the center
of the earth and the lava,

52:07.021 --> 52:08.481
just keeping us stuck.

52:08.564 --> 52:09.982
It's not a magnet.

52:11.692 --> 52:14.028
What if it stopped, you know?

52:14.111 --> 52:15.112
Or what if it stopped

52:15.196 --> 52:18.866
just right in the spot where I was?

52:19.867 --> 52:21.410
I feel like that could happen.

52:21.494 --> 52:24.413
And if there wasn't anything
keeping me here anymore

52:24.497 --> 52:26.624
and I just floated off the planet...

52:28.834 --> 52:33.172
I guess I'd grab a tree
or branch or something

52:33.255 --> 52:35.132
to stay connected to the earth.

52:35.466 --> 52:39.011
You know, so I wouldn't go floating
up into space!

52:43.224 --> 52:44.767
I don't think I'd grab on.

52:46.769 --> 52:48.145
I'd go.

52:56.904 --> 52:58.948
[radio chatter]

52:59.031 --> 53:02.076
[distant siren]

53:09.500 --> 53:10.626
[knock on door]

53:12.086 --> 53:13.504
Mrs. Ford?

53:14.255 --> 53:17.133
I'm Louisa Kinnie,
I'm with Child Protective Services.

53:17.216 --> 53:18.509
I need to speak with you.

53:19.885 --> 53:22.596
They sent a pregnant woman
to help me find my kid.

53:22.680 --> 53:24.098
Is this a joke?

53:24.932 --> 53:26.017
May I come in?

53:35.109 --> 53:36.402
This is quite a collection.

53:36.902 --> 53:38.904
- She loved to dress up.
- Hmm!

53:42.158 --> 53:43.951
And that's quite a collection as well.

53:48.164 --> 53:50.332
I'm the mother, not a suspect.

53:50.875 --> 53:52.168
Unfortunately, Mrs. Ford,

53:52.251 --> 53:54.670
we need to consider all possibilities.

53:54.754 --> 53:56.005
It's my job to determine

53:56.088 --> 53:59.008
how you planned
for the safety of this child.

54:03.054 --> 54:04.555
Is that your first kid?

54:06.182 --> 54:08.851
No, it's my third.

54:10.770 --> 54:12.271
Imagine losing one.

54:15.441 --> 54:16.609
I can't.

54:20.988 --> 54:22.031
[Manuel] No, no!

54:22.114 --> 54:24.450
Hey, let me help you, Mrs. Mooney.

54:24.533 --> 54:25.659
Thank you!

54:26.243 --> 54:27.745
There you go!

54:29.747 --> 54:31.040
You got a baby, Mrs. Mooney?

54:31.123 --> 54:33.125
No! I have a...

54:33.209 --> 54:35.628
actually, I have a granddaughter.

54:36.128 --> 54:38.339
- Not possible.
- Possible!

54:38.422 --> 54:41.092
You're the best looking grandma
I ever saw.

54:44.261 --> 54:47.932
Now, there is a smile in there,
one day I'm gonna get it.

54:48.015 --> 54:49.850
Maybe even see a little teeth.

54:53.354 --> 54:54.814
Thank you, Manuel.

54:55.356 --> 54:58.150
My pleasure...

54:58.818 --> 55:00.361
Margo.

55:01.821 --> 55:02.905
Margo!

55:10.037 --> 55:11.497
Margo.

55:13.624 --> 55:14.750
Yoo-hoo!

55:23.175 --> 55:25.386
- What the hell is going on?
- Shh! It's nap time.

55:25.469 --> 55:27.429
I thought we could repaint the paintings.

55:28.097 --> 55:29.431
You're not serious!

55:29.974 --> 55:30.975
You hate them.

55:31.058 --> 55:32.643
You said that you hated them, so...

55:32.726 --> 55:35.271
No! Absolutely not!

55:35.354 --> 55:36.981
My God! My furniture!

55:37.064 --> 55:38.315
What have you done?

55:38.399 --> 55:39.859
I put out newspapers.

55:39.942 --> 55:41.402
No! These are my things.

55:41.485 --> 55:42.903
You have no right to touch them.

55:43.195 --> 55:45.114
I just thought it would be fun, and...

55:45.364 --> 55:47.324
Who does that? What's wrong with you?

55:47.950 --> 55:49.869
Pfft! A lot? [scoffs]

55:50.578 --> 55:52.913
This is my home, it's not a joke.

55:52.997 --> 55:53.831
[Tallulah] Okay.

55:53.914 --> 55:56.458
God, this is a 1920s Soumak carpet.

55:56.542 --> 55:59.170
You can't just do anything you want.

55:59.253 --> 56:01.755
- I just thought that you...
- Don't! stop it!

56:01.839 --> 56:03.424
Stop. You don't know what I want.

56:03.507 --> 56:06.969
You're... like a feral beast.

56:07.052 --> 56:09.889
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- These things aren't even yours.

56:09.972 --> 56:12.224
Don't do that! I took you in.

56:12.308 --> 56:13.809
I will not be taken advantage of.

56:13.893 --> 56:15.102
It's not personal, Margo.

56:15.186 --> 56:16.520
Of course it's personal!

56:16.604 --> 56:18.898
Get your filthy fingers off of that.

56:18.981 --> 56:22.568
I will not let some crazy kid come in

56:22.651 --> 56:25.321
and destroy my life for her own amusement.

56:25.404 --> 56:26.947
Jesus!

56:28.115 --> 56:29.450
No wonder Nico left.

56:31.744 --> 56:33.287
I need you to go.

56:33.871 --> 56:35.748
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

56:35.831 --> 56:37.499
Get out! Go live in your van.

56:37.583 --> 56:39.919
You can paint any goddamn thing you want.

56:40.002 --> 56:45.174
This is where I live! This is my space!
I have things the way I want them!

56:45.257 --> 56:47.676
Do you understand? This is how I like it!

56:48.093 --> 56:48.969
[screams]

56:49.053 --> 56:52.890
Oh, oh my, oh, no, no, no!

56:55.392 --> 57:00.439
Oh! Oh my God! Oh!

57:04.652 --> 57:05.652
[sighs]

57:16.747 --> 57:19.959
See? Now it's yours.

57:25.422 --> 57:27.258
I've done crazy things.

57:27.633 --> 57:28.842
Sure.

57:29.927 --> 57:30.927
[Margo] Wild.

57:30.970 --> 57:33.764
- I mean, I bet I can beat it, but...
- Mm-hmm.

57:33.847 --> 57:35.641
[news program playing on TV]

57:37.810 --> 57:40.312
I smuggled heroin in my crotch.

57:40.854 --> 57:41.981
No, you didn't.

57:42.982 --> 57:44.525
- Sort of.
- How do you sort of...

57:44.608 --> 57:46.235
smuggle heroin in your crotch?

57:46.318 --> 57:49.405
I had a boyfriend, we were madly in love,

57:49.488 --> 57:52.241
he was in a terrible
rock band, he was so...

57:53.617 --> 57:55.369
sexy!

57:56.870 --> 57:59.206
And we were coming back
from a trip to India...

57:59.290 --> 58:00.416
Oh my God, I wanna go!

58:00.499 --> 58:02.084
Don't, it's horrible!

58:02.167 --> 58:04.253
Dead cows floating down the same river

58:04.336 --> 58:07.006

It's horr... dirty, dirty.

58:08.757 --> 58:11.885
I made it as far as the airport bathroom.

58:11.969 --> 58:13.512
And?

58:14.471 --> 58:16.432
I couldn't stick it up there.

58:16.765 --> 58:18.142
I panicked. I left it on the sink.

58:18.434 --> 58:19.578
And what happened to the guy?

58:19.602 --> 58:21.520
He was furious,
he dumped me after that trip.

58:21.604 --> 58:23.564
I was just too much of
a goody two-shoes.

58:23.647 --> 58:25.149
You need to tell Nico this story,

58:25.232 --> 58:27.401
because he thinks you're such a tight ass.

58:31.030 --> 58:32.323
Is that why he left?

58:32.865 --> 58:35.618
I don't know.
He said something like...

58:35.701 --> 58:38.829
"I'm her son, I'm not her husband."

58:41.081 --> 58:44.209
Well, my God! I know that.

58:47.630 --> 58:49.149
[news program] <i>Madison has blond hair...</i>

The suspect is a woman...</i>

58:51.967 --> 58:54.720
[Margo] Did he use that word, "tight ass"?

58:57.222 --> 58:59.016
Christ! Well, you know what,

58:59.099 --> 59:01.477
you do everything you can,
and still screw up.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.687
[baby crying]

59:04.605 --> 59:05.605
I'll get her.

59:06.940 --> 59:09.860

She's never going to sleep.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.306
How could you let this happen?

59:21.330 --> 59:24.750
[Louisa] The police can't control
what the newspapers print, Mrs. Ford.

59:24.833 --> 59:26.627
They interviewed an employee of the hotel.

59:26.710 --> 59:28.504
I don't give a <i>fuck</i> who they interviewed.

59:28.587 --> 59:29.672
These people are liars.

59:29.755 --> 59:31.315
[Carolyn] They probably sold the story,

59:31.382 --> 59:32.966
or maybe they're working together

59:33.050 --> 59:35.427
in a kidnapping ring.
Did you think about that?

59:36.845 --> 59:38.325
Do you think you're ready to go home?

59:38.722 --> 59:40.265
No, I'll stay here.

59:40.349 --> 59:43.644
It may be a while
before we locate your daughter.

59:43.727 --> 59:46.271
After the first 72 hours,
it becomes more difficult.

59:46.355 --> 59:47.439
I can't go home.

59:47.523 --> 59:49.483
[Louisa] Well, do you have
someone you can call?

59:49.566 --> 59:51.318
I'd rather you didn't.

59:52.444 --> 59:55.197
Oh, right. You're one of those, huh?

59:55.739 --> 59:57.950
[Carolyn] Prenatal yoga,

59:58.033 --> 59:59.660
I bet you just love breastfeeding, huh?

59:59.743 --> 01:00:01.954
It's one of your favorite things
in the world.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.581
It worked for me.

01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:10.462
We contacted your husband.

01:00:12.256 --> 01:00:13.966
- No!
- Is this a problem for you?

01:00:14.049 --> 01:00:15.759
I have to get out of here.

01:00:16.301 --> 01:00:18.762
Mrs. Ford, we're not done here.

01:00:18.846 --> 01:00:20.055
I'm not supposed to be here.

01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:21.598
I'm not supposed to be in the city.

01:00:21.682 --> 01:00:22.725
He'll never forgive me.

01:00:23.726 --> 01:00:25.269
- Mrs. Ford...
- God!

01:00:25.728 --> 01:00:27.813
[Louisa] Mrs. Ford, finding fault

01:00:27.896 --> 01:00:30.190
does not necessarily mean
action will be taken.

01:00:30.274 --> 01:00:32.443
My husband thinks I'm a terrible mother.

01:00:32.526 --> 01:00:33.861
He said it from the beginning.

01:00:33.944 --> 01:00:35.904
Every time she cried,
all the fucking time,

01:00:35.988 --> 01:00:37.364
it was always my fault.

01:00:37.448 --> 01:00:39.908
And now he gets to throw it in my face!

01:00:39.992 --> 01:00:41.785
You people aren't doing anything.

01:00:41.869 --> 01:00:43.829
Do I have to go and find her myself?

01:00:43.912 --> 01:00:47.833
That might show me you care,
which I'm not sure I believe.

01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:49.418
You can't talk to me like that.

01:00:49.501 --> 01:00:51.670
- I'll get you fired.
- Oh, go for it.

01:00:54.047 --> 01:00:55.966
You wouldn't be the first
shitty mom to try.

01:00:56.633 --> 01:01:01.096
I deal with parents every day who should
have never brought a life into this world,

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.601
but most of them are poor or addicts,
which I don't forgive them for,

01:01:05.684 --> 01:01:08.479
but I can understand
why it might be hard for them

01:01:08.562 --> 01:01:09.646
to do the right thing.

01:01:10.439 --> 01:01:11.439
You...

01:01:12.524 --> 01:01:15.027
I'm finding it hard to make excuses for.

01:01:15.569 --> 01:01:17.863
If you only knew
what this was like for me.

01:01:20.783 --> 01:01:23.869
I am embarrassed. I can't see him.

01:01:26.997 --> 01:01:29.458
- You can't go.
- What are you gonna do?

01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:31.251
Arrest me?

Hey.

01:02:17.923 --> 01:02:18.757
What happened?

01:02:18.841 --> 01:02:23.011
These mother fuckers took my wheels,
they jacked up my frame.

- Bunch of assholes.

- Yeah, sorry...

I wanted to get a job as a dishwasher,

01:03:09.808 --> 01:03:11.894
but people get weirded out
when I say that.

01:03:12.978 --> 01:03:16.565
I guess because
I'm not a little Puerto Rican dude,

01:03:16.648 --> 01:03:17.900
or something.

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.486
- No, you're not a Puerto Rican dude.
- I'm not, right?

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:22.821
Bummer.

- There.
- Where?

Nice.

01:03:36.919 --> 01:03:38.378

'Cause my dad likes dick.

Yeah.

in that direction?

No.

01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:12.746
Good.

A glass of wine.

Would you like a glass of wine?

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:15.892
And you can't because you're working.

01:05:15.976 --> 01:05:19.813
Eh, no. No.

It's okay, I'm gonna take a break.

01:05:24.818 --> 01:05:25.902
I could take a break.

01:05:25.986 --> 01:05:27.195
Yeah. I take a break

01:05:27.279 --> 01:05:29.406

- No, I don't. Actually, no.

I really don't drink wine.

Oh, um. Yeah, okay.

01:06:30.383 --> 01:06:34.387
Uh, I don't have beer. I've got whiskey.

01:06:37.682 --> 01:06:39.309
Ooh! What are you doing?

01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:42.562
Well, I thought you wanted me to...

01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:44.856
- I thought you wanted...
- You were wrong.

01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:49.361
Oh. Oh.

01:06:49.444 --> 01:06:51.488
[clears throat] Okay.

01:06:52.155 --> 01:06:54.032
I think it's best that you leave.

01:06:56.868 --> 01:06:58.203
Okay.

01:07:00.872 --> 01:07:01.998
Okay.

01:07:08.922 --> 01:07:10.006
[door closes]

01:07:29.067 --> 01:07:30.068
Margo?

01:07:30.152 --> 01:07:31.862
- [Margo] Yes?
- She's dead.

01:07:31.945 --> 01:07:32.945
What?

01:07:33.363 --> 01:07:34.197
Or asleep...

01:07:34.281 --> 01:07:36.408
- It's either dead or asleep.
- Jesus!

01:07:49.754 --> 01:07:51.298
She's asleep.

01:07:52.132 --> 01:07:54.009
- [sighs]
- Don't do that to me.

01:07:57.262 --> 01:07:58.680
Well, she wasn't moving.

01:07:59.139 --> 01:08:00.932
The breathing part was questionable.

01:08:01.016 --> 01:08:03.310
She seemed dead.
I think we should wake her up.

01:08:03.393 --> 01:08:07.731
No, don't do that.
Lu, babies need a routine.

01:08:07.814 --> 01:08:10.734
[Margo] The kid is exhausted.
Leave her alone.

01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:13.069
Oh, my God!

01:08:14.154 --> 01:08:15.864
Oh, you scared the...

01:08:18.241 --> 01:08:19.720
Can I lie down with you for a minute?

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:21.243
Well, um...

01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:22.328
Well...

01:08:28.585 --> 01:08:29.877
Oh, your feet are freezing.

01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:31.129
Sorry.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.894
- But she is gonna die.
- What?

01:08:45.977 --> 01:08:47.562
Well, not now, not soon.

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:48.645
I certainly hope not.

01:08:48.688 --> 01:08:51.566
Hopefully, like,
really far into the future,

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:53.443
but still she's...

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:58.907
she's gonna die and that... makes me sad.

01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.908
Oh, we're all gonna die.

01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:02.911
Right? We're all gonna die.

01:09:04.578 --> 01:09:06.206
It's super sad.

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:08.792
Yeah.

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:10.919
I like it here.

01:09:13.587 --> 01:09:17.591
Either you'll die first
and I'll be sad or,

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:22.055
I'll die first and you'll be sad.

01:09:25.015 --> 01:09:26.434
Either way,

01:09:28.853 --> 01:09:30.313
we're all gonna be dead.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:38.697
[laughter]

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:42.575
- It's so fucking sad!
- It's the saddest thing ever!

01:09:42.658 --> 01:09:43.993
- So sad!
- So sad!

01:09:44.077 --> 01:09:45.996
It's really sad.

01:09:46.078 --> 01:09:47.497
[laughter]

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.957
Oh, what is the point?

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:51.626
It's sad!

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:52.961
- [laughter]
- What?

01:09:57.424 --> 01:09:58.675
Oh-oh-oh.

01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:02.595
I tried to seduce the doorman.

01:10:02.679 --> 01:10:04.848
What? When?

01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:06.641
This afternoon.

01:10:06.725 --> 01:10:09.227
You slut!

01:10:09.311 --> 01:10:12.397
He kissed me, and I threw him out.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.357
Why did... You wanted him to kiss you.

01:10:14.441 --> 01:10:16.318
- That's why...
- No! I mean, yes.

01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:19.154
But he caught me off guard
and I didn't know what to do.

01:10:19.237 --> 01:10:20.989
You should've grabbed his cock!

01:10:22.073 --> 01:10:24.242
Just grab right on
to that shaft, you know.

01:10:24.326 --> 01:10:26.619
Ah! Well, I didn't think of that.

01:10:26.703 --> 01:10:31.041
Well, you should've. Oh, poor guy! God!

01:10:31.124 --> 01:10:33.585
- Why poor guy?
- He likes you.

01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:49.726
You tryin' to put the moves on me?

01:10:49.809 --> 01:10:51.102
[giggles]

01:10:54.647 --> 01:10:55.940
Nico used to do that. But...

01:10:56.024 --> 01:10:58.568
[sighs] He was so bad at it.

01:11:18.171 --> 01:11:19.339
[ship horn blowing]

01:11:22.008 --> 01:11:23.051
[Nico] Dive in.

01:11:25.178 --> 01:11:26.221
I dare you.

01:11:28.181 --> 01:11:29.349
[chuckles]

01:11:31.142 --> 01:11:33.228
This is my favorite spot in Manhattan.

01:11:33.311 --> 01:11:35.063
I come here all the time.

01:11:35.146 --> 01:11:36.398
Why?

01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:39.526
Because it makes you realize
you're on an island.

01:11:40.068 --> 01:11:41.319
Yep.

01:11:42.654 --> 01:11:45.573
[Nico] And say all the bridges were gone,

01:11:45.657 --> 01:11:48.535
and the tunnels, the subways,

01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:54.165
and we all had to just jump in and swim.

01:11:54.249 --> 01:11:56.209
[ship horn blowing]

01:11:59.337 --> 01:12:00.672
[Nico] You could do it, you know.

01:12:02.924 --> 01:12:04.384
Just swim away.

01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:11.057
- I have to leave.
- What do you mean?

01:12:11.933 --> 01:12:13.268
I have to get out of New York.

01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:15.645
- I want to come with you.
- No, you don't.

01:12:15.728 --> 01:12:17.230
Come on, why not?

01:12:17.313 --> 01:12:20.066
Because you wouldn't like
the way I live, remember?

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:22.235
I love how you live, it's amazing.

01:12:22.318 --> 01:12:23.318
Yeah, right.

01:12:23.361 --> 01:12:24.571
Let's go, right now.

01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:26.156
- Right now?
- Yeah.

01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:28.825
What's stopping us?
Come on, stand up, let's go.

01:12:29.367 --> 01:12:31.744
- You have to say goodbye.
- Fuck that!

01:12:31.828 --> 01:12:34.205
To your mom? You can't leave her alone.

01:12:34.539 --> 01:12:37.000
[police sirens wailing]

01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:39.419
They're coming for you, Lu.

01:12:39.502 --> 01:12:41.546
[police sirens wailing]

01:12:54.392 --> 01:12:56.895
[Margo] Just chattering away
in her crib. She won't go down.

01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:59.314
If you woke her earlier,
she might go down for her nap.

01:12:59.397 --> 01:13:00.231
Is that today's paper?

01:13:00.315 --> 01:13:02.317
- Don't throw that out!
- I read it, it's trash.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.152
It's the <i> New York Times.</i>

01:13:04.652 --> 01:13:06.738
[phone rings]

01:13:07.322 --> 01:13:09.741
Here! This is trash.

01:13:11.993 --> 01:13:13.286
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's Stephen.</i>

01:13:13.369 --> 01:13:14.662
Oh, Stephen, hi.

01:13:14.746 --> 01:13:16.289
- Uh...
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>

01:13:16.372 --> 01:13:18.041
- I'm fine.
<i>- You called?</i>

01:13:18.124 --> 01:13:19.834
Yes, I called you.

01:13:19.918 --> 01:13:21.377
I guess, I mean...

01:13:31.429 --> 01:13:34.474
[breathing heavily]

01:13:38.686 --> 01:13:40.063
[Margo] Okay! All right.

01:13:44.943 --> 01:13:46.277
Why did I just do that?

01:13:46.736 --> 01:13:47.779
Do what?

01:13:47.862 --> 01:13:51.574
That was Nico's dad, he wants to meet you,

01:13:51.658 --> 01:13:52.867
he's invited us for lunch.

01:13:52.951 --> 01:13:54.911
That's all right, we can go do that.

01:13:54.994 --> 01:13:56.829
I can't, he's with a man!

01:13:57.789 --> 01:13:58.623
Yeah, I knew that.

01:13:58.706 --> 01:14:02.210
I mean, I don't want to see him
in his blissful domestic gay...

01:14:02.293 --> 01:14:04.671
I can't be part of that.
I can't go to that apartment.

01:14:04.754 --> 01:14:06.756
I don't want to see him happy. I can't!

01:14:07.257 --> 01:14:09.008
[buzzes]

01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:13.137
[Margo sighs] How do I look?

01:14:13.846 --> 01:14:14.931
Don't even answer me.

01:14:16.724 --> 01:14:18.726
[Andreas] <i> Sorry, sorry, it's Andreas.</i>

01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:22.522
<i>I was in the kitchen trying to make sense
of the artichokes. Come in...</i>

01:14:23.815 --> 01:14:26.776
[door buzzes]

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:34.158
Would you like some wine, Tallulah?

01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:36.327
[Andreas] Please don't wait for me.

01:14:36.411 --> 01:14:38.204
Everybody dig in. It's gonna get cold.

01:14:38.288 --> 01:14:40.540
I just have to finish this dressing...

01:14:40.623 --> 01:14:45.461
which may or may not be a total disaster.

01:14:45.545 --> 01:14:47.463
[Stephen] It'll be great.

01:14:47.547 --> 01:14:49.382
- Here we go.
- Over here.

01:14:49.465 --> 01:14:50.717
Aww, thanks, babe.

01:14:53.386 --> 01:14:55.930
Oh, it's a dorji, it's from Bhutan.

01:14:56.014 --> 01:14:57.890
It's a wooden penis.

01:14:57.974 --> 01:14:59.934
[Andreas] It's a symbol of fertility.

01:15:00.018 --> 01:15:02.246
People paint them
on their doors to protect their houses.

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:05.607
Turns out Andreas couldn't
contain himself from Cambodia.

01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:07.567
We came home with two extra suitcases.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:08.860
If we're going to adopt,

01:15:09.652 --> 01:15:12.530
we want to make sure the baby's surrounded
by objects from his culture.

01:15:13.072 --> 01:15:14.574
[baby cooing]

01:15:14.657 --> 01:15:15.825
You're adopting?

01:15:15.908 --> 01:15:19.829
No, no! Anyway, we can't.

01:15:19.912 --> 01:15:21.331
Is that the big rush?

01:15:21.414 --> 01:15:23.082
Hardly a rush. It's been three years.

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.792
No, it's just a conversation.

01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:26.586
There's this orphanage in Phnom Penh,

01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:28.463
you guys should see how these kids live.

01:15:28.546 --> 01:15:30.006
They have absolutely nothing,

01:15:30.089 --> 01:15:31.466
and you have to be really careful

01:15:31.549 --> 01:15:33.926
because there's this
whole orphan tourism thing

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:36.304
that's going on there,
and it's unregulated.

01:15:36.387 --> 01:15:39.265
And these people
hide behind Christian groups,

01:15:39.349 --> 01:15:40.933
and a lot of these kids

01:15:41.017 --> 01:15:42.185
have a parent.

01:15:42.268 --> 01:15:44.687
Obviously we're doing
research and figuring out...

01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:48.149
Anyway, there's...
so much red tape at the embassy,

01:15:48.232 --> 01:15:50.026
it's not even worth discussing.

01:15:50.109 --> 01:15:51.109
Let's eat.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.072
[phone ringing]

01:15:54.155 --> 01:15:55.406
Okay.

01:15:56.407 --> 01:15:57.617
Try this one.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.869
I'm sorry, ma'am,
there's a hold on the account.

01:15:59.952 --> 01:16:01.329
What the fuck does that mean?

01:16:01.412 --> 01:16:02.732
Perhaps you could call your bank.

01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:05.917
Can you just run this card please?

01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:09.003
Is this a joint account?

01:16:10.672 --> 01:16:12.215
It's my husband's account.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.093
Well, perhaps your husband knows
what's happened.

01:16:20.264 --> 01:16:21.391
[phone ringing]

01:16:25.645 --> 01:16:30.483
So, Tallulah, are you named after
the infamous Tallulah Bankhead?

01:16:30.566 --> 01:16:33.194
- Yup!
- Oh, really? Hmm.

01:16:34.696 --> 01:16:36.781
[Stephen]
Those are some footsteps to follow in.

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:39.742
She has one of
my favorite quotes, all-time.

01:16:39.826 --> 01:16:42.995
- [Tallulah] Yeah?
- Yeah. Oh, how's it go?

01:16:43.413 --> 01:16:45.623
"If I had to live my life again,

01:16:45.707 --> 01:16:48.459
I would make the same mistakes,
only sooner."

01:16:49.794 --> 01:16:51.295
I think that's a pretty great quote.

01:16:57.593 --> 01:16:59.679
I don't know why I just said that.

01:16:59.762 --> 01:17:01.347
I don't even know who she is.

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:04.183
I was named after a dive bar
in Summerville

01:17:04.267 --> 01:17:07.186
where my mom used to waitress,
Tallulah's Bar and Grill.

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:10.189
It had, like, 65 beers on tap,

01:17:10.273 --> 01:17:12.113
and one day they were
gonna go out of business,

01:17:12.191 --> 01:17:13.693
so they threw this really big

01:17:13.776 --> 01:17:15.236
kick the kegs kind of party,

01:17:15.319 --> 01:17:17.280
and the whole neighborhood came.

01:17:17.363 --> 01:17:19.031
And that's the night I was conceived.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:26.372
Wow! An auspicious beginning!

01:17:28.374 --> 01:17:32.044
[clears throat] Expresso, anyone?

01:17:32.128 --> 01:17:34.756
- [Margo] I'll have one. Thank you.
<i>- Espresso.</i>

01:17:34.839 --> 01:17:35.839
[Tallulah] Sorry...

01:17:36.841 --> 01:17:38.760
No, it's okay. Don't worry about it,

01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:40.136
it's my fault, please.

01:17:40.219 --> 01:17:42.638
Piling's hardly the same thing
as cleaning up.

01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:48.269
Please do not judge me for this,
it's my only guilty pleasure.

01:17:55.026 --> 01:17:57.153
Where was Nico conceived?

01:17:57.236 --> 01:17:59.989
Uh... Maybe a too personal question.

01:18:00.072 --> 01:18:03.534
[Margo] In my graduate school dorm room,
in the middle of midterm exams.

01:18:06.412 --> 01:18:07.830
You're absolutely right.

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:43.282
[Stephen] So, Lu,
I'm trying to chart your course.

01:18:43.366 --> 01:18:45.243
The last time you saw Nico was in?

01:18:45.868 --> 01:18:46.911
Tennessee.

01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:48.663
We were traveling around the country.

01:18:48.746 --> 01:18:50.122
For how long?

01:18:50.206 --> 01:18:51.541
Couple of years.

01:18:51.999 --> 01:18:53.459
Weren't you scared?

01:18:53.543 --> 01:18:54.752
[Stephen] With the baby?

01:18:54.836 --> 01:18:56.796
[Margo] They travel, Stephen,
that's what they do.

01:18:56.879 --> 01:18:58.506
Yeah, it was fun.

01:18:58.589 --> 01:19:00.424
If it was so much fun, why did he leave?

01:19:01.759 --> 01:19:03.553
He just was... he said he was tired.

01:19:04.554 --> 01:19:07.723
So you're in love,
you're living in a van with a baby,

01:19:07.807 --> 01:19:11.269
and suddenly my son
just decides to ditch his kid,

01:19:11.352 --> 01:19:13.688
and, what? Walk back to New York?

01:19:13.771 --> 01:19:16.315
- He's probably hitchhiking.
- Stephen, what are you doing?

01:19:16.399 --> 01:19:17.316
He's being pretty rude.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.902
No, I'm not being rude.
I'm trying to get it straight.

01:19:19.986 --> 01:19:22.226
I'm trying to find out
what the fuck happened to our son.

01:19:22.947 --> 01:19:26.409
[Stephen] Now this is the last
person who saw him alive.

01:19:26.909 --> 01:19:28.452
Doesn't that concern you?

01:19:28.536 --> 01:19:29.996
Of course it concerns me.

01:19:30.079 --> 01:19:31.831
Do you honestly believe any of this shit?

01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:35.167
That he would leave his child
in the care of this girl?

01:19:35.251 --> 01:19:38.087
How do we even know that that kid is his?

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:40.548
[Margo] For God's sake,
people leave all the time.

01:19:40.631 --> 01:19:43.259
- He could be dead for all we know.
- He's not dead.

01:19:43.342 --> 01:19:44.594
Of course he's not dead.

01:19:44.677 --> 01:19:47.638
Are you giving her money? Are you?

01:19:47.722 --> 01:19:49.765
- This girl is a liar.
- You're the liar.

01:19:51.475 --> 01:19:53.144
You're a liar, and you're unkind.

01:19:53.227 --> 01:19:55.372
[Stephen] You just don't want to see her
for what she is.

01:19:55.396 --> 01:19:56.707
[Margo] Twenty years of deception,

01:19:56.731 --> 01:19:58.774
all of a sudden,
you're the pope of honesty.

01:19:58.858 --> 01:20:01.652
- I'm looking out for you.
- You don't get to be the hero!

01:20:02.653 --> 01:20:05.239
All our friends think
you did something brave,

01:20:05.323 --> 01:20:08.034
but you cheated and you lied,

01:20:08.117 --> 01:20:10.286
and you fucked around and you left!

01:20:10.786 --> 01:20:12.955
And now, you get to have all of this!

01:20:13.414 --> 01:20:16.000
And I get to rot in that goddamn apartment

01:20:16.083 --> 01:20:17.460
in the middle of all your shit.

01:20:17.543 --> 01:20:19.545
[Stephen] Well then, move on.

01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:21.589
Sign the papers. Be done with it.

01:20:21.672 --> 01:20:23.341
Why? Why?

01:20:23.424 --> 01:20:26.177
Because God forbid I make it hard for you,

01:20:26.302 --> 01:20:28.804
as if it isn't hard enough being a faggot!

01:20:29.555 --> 01:20:31.557
You let me build this family on a lie,

01:20:31.641 --> 01:20:34.685
you let me make it my life,
and you knew the whole time!

01:20:34.769 --> 01:20:36.437
That's what kills me! You knew!

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:39.523
[shouting] Goddammit,
you knew the whole time too!

01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:40.691
You knew!

01:20:42.652 --> 01:20:44.362
If we're really being honest here.

01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:49.200
I loved you and I loved our family.

01:20:49.283 --> 01:20:52.203
And how dare you call someone else a liar?

01:20:52.286 --> 01:20:53.913
How dare you be mean to her?

01:20:53.996 --> 01:20:56.749
At least she has the balls
to be who she really is.

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.627
Let me have her. Let me have her.

01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:00.878
Come here, sweetheart.

01:21:00.962 --> 01:21:03.673
Lu, come on. It's okay, baby.

01:21:10.638 --> 01:21:11.722
[door closes]

01:21:13.391 --> 01:21:14.391
Oh!

01:21:17.561 --> 01:21:20.022
The last eight years of our marriage,

01:21:20.106 --> 01:21:22.441
he didn't touch me, and I stayed.

01:21:22.525 --> 01:21:23.859
I stayed!

01:21:31.909 --> 01:21:34.954
Come on, is every cab
in the city off duty?

01:21:35.037 --> 01:21:36.872
Oh, I can't believe how angry I am.

01:21:38.082 --> 01:21:39.434
Come on, let's go down to Broadway.

01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:40.668
[Tallulah] Where's the subway?

01:21:40.751 --> 01:21:44.213
- No, it's not safe.
- What are you afraid of, terrorists?

01:21:44.296 --> 01:21:46.007
Like they're gonna gas the 1 train?

01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:47.090
Yes!

01:21:47.508 --> 01:21:49.093
So we die, big deal.

01:21:49.176 --> 01:21:51.387
- Get that shit over with.
- Lu, please.

01:21:53.431 --> 01:21:55.975
[Tallulah] Does she look sweaty to you?
She's sweaty.

01:22:03.607 --> 01:22:05.609
Ma'am, there's no smoking.

01:22:14.869 --> 01:22:16.454
Stop, stop!

01:22:16.537 --> 01:22:18.622
- What?
- Stop!

01:22:18.706 --> 01:22:20.416
[cars honking]

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:23.085
Maddy! Madison!

01:22:23.169 --> 01:22:25.880
Ma'am, you have to pay me.
This has happened to me before.

01:22:25.963 --> 01:22:26.963
[Carolyn] Madison!

01:22:28.257 --> 01:22:30.801
[Margo] ...money. How much does it cost?

01:22:31.969 --> 01:22:32.969
[Carolyn] Maddy!

01:22:33.345 --> 01:22:35.097
[Tallulah] Come on, we gotta go!

01:22:35.973 --> 01:22:36.891
[Margo] Lu...

01:22:36.974 --> 01:22:39.226
No, you don't understand, she has my kid!

01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:40.352
- No, no.
- Oh, my God!

01:22:40.436 --> 01:22:42.646
[Margo] Lu! Stop running.

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:44.482
Lu, wait!

01:22:46.817 --> 01:22:48.152
Wait!

01:22:48.652 --> 01:22:49.987
Lu, wait!

01:22:50.905 --> 01:22:51.989
Do you have a card?

01:22:52.073 --> 01:22:54.450
I don't know.
I may have an old one in here.

01:22:54.784 --> 01:22:57.328
I haven't used it in so long,
I don't even know if I have...

01:22:57.411 --> 01:22:58.829
Oh, what is your hurry?

01:22:58.913 --> 01:22:59.997
Sorry. I'm just...

01:23:00.498 --> 01:23:02.124
- Here!
- Thank you!

01:23:03.876 --> 01:23:05.544
[Cab driver] Forgot your luggage!

01:23:05.628 --> 01:23:07.046
Oh my God!

01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:16.639
All right, now pass it back to me.

01:23:20.142 --> 01:23:22.561
Come on, let's go. To the train, come on.

01:23:22.645 --> 01:23:25.106
Lu, I don't think that's allowed!

01:23:27.566 --> 01:23:28.566
Move!

01:23:34.198 --> 01:23:35.741
Stop her! Stop!

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.243
[Carolyn] Stop her!

01:23:38.285 --> 01:23:39.285
Oh!

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:41.830
[Margo] Wait!

01:23:50.714 --> 01:23:52.716
Ma'am, no. You need to swipe your card.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.718
No, stop, wait. Look, you can't...

01:23:54.802 --> 01:23:55.803
[Carolyn] It's my baby.

01:23:55.886 --> 01:23:57.012
Come on.

01:23:57.096 --> 01:23:59.348
[announcement over PA]

01:24:04.687 --> 01:24:07.815
No! Oh my God! Madison!

01:24:07.898 --> 01:24:10.067
Somebody, stop this train!

01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:12.611
Oh, my God! Somebody help me!

01:24:12.945 --> 01:24:15.990
Oh my God! Somebody help me!

01:24:20.911 --> 01:24:23.038
[sobbing] Somebody!

01:24:24.165 --> 01:24:28.252
- Why did you run? Answer me!
- I think there's something wrong with her.

01:24:28.335 --> 01:24:29.170
[baby cries]

01:24:29.253 --> 01:24:31.046
She has a fever. She's hot!

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:32.131
Who was that woman?

01:24:32.214 --> 01:24:34.842
- What woman?
- The woman who chased us.

01:24:34.925 --> 01:24:36.302
Did she say something to you?

01:24:36.385 --> 01:24:41.015
What would she have told me?
What the fuck is going on here?

01:24:41.098 --> 01:24:42.933
Who are you, really?

01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:46.670
- That's my stuff. What are you doing?
- Looking through it.

01:24:52.067 --> 01:24:53.736
Did you steal from her too?

01:24:54.486 --> 01:24:55.404
Okay, we're leaving.

01:24:55.487 --> 01:24:58.032
- I want answers. What have you done?
- Nothing!

01:24:58.115 --> 01:25:00.155
No one runs like that
unless they've done something.

01:25:00.201 --> 01:25:01.744
I just felt like running!

01:25:01.827 --> 01:25:03.954
Lu, look at me.

01:25:05.706 --> 01:25:07.750
I need the whole story.

01:25:08.334 --> 01:25:10.878
So what, I'm a thief? I'm a liar?

01:25:10.961 --> 01:25:12.755
You don't ask, you just assume?

01:25:12.838 --> 01:25:15.883
What am I supposed to think?
I know you're hiding something.

01:25:15.966 --> 01:25:18.636
- I've known since you showed up.
- I don't have to tell you.

01:25:18.719 --> 01:25:20.930
I took care of you. You owe me.

01:25:21.013 --> 01:25:22.773
You take care of someone
because you want to.

01:25:22.806 --> 01:25:24.558
You don't throw it in their face.

01:25:24.642 --> 01:25:27.311
I am trying to help you.

01:25:27.895 --> 01:25:31.857
If you are in trouble, it's okay.

01:25:31.941 --> 01:25:33.901
Tell me what you did.

01:25:33.984 --> 01:25:34.985
I'm so stupid.

01:25:35.069 --> 01:25:37.709
I should have known. I don't know why
I thought this was different.

01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:39.365
This is your family.

01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:42.701
I'm not your fucking family.

01:25:44.828 --> 01:25:45.704
No...

01:25:45.788 --> 01:25:48.165
Please don't take her.

01:25:48.249 --> 01:25:49.166
Please don't take her.

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:50.930
[Tallulah] She's sick,
you don't even care.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.211
If she's sick, don't take her.

01:25:53.295 --> 01:25:55.631
- Lu!
- [baby crying]

01:26:04.974 --> 01:26:06.600
- [horn blares]
- [Tallulah] Shit!

01:26:10.604 --> 01:26:12.439
Oh, fuck!

01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:14.191
Okay, all right.

01:26:14.275 --> 01:26:15.818
I'm gonna get you some medicine.

01:26:15.901 --> 01:26:17.903
- [baby crying]
- You're gonna be okay.

01:26:17.987 --> 01:26:21.490
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:26:27.871 --> 01:26:29.123
[sighs]

01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:44.305
You were drunk, Carolyn?

01:27:13.959 --> 01:27:15.377
Hi, Mom.

01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:18.629
Hi!

01:27:22.134 --> 01:27:23.969
I'm not gonna ask
what you were doing here.

01:27:24.053 --> 01:27:25.095
I don't care anymore.

01:27:25.179 --> 01:27:27.931
Nothing could be worse than what
you've done to our daughter.

01:27:29.058 --> 01:27:32.061
You are worthless, Carolyn.

01:27:32.144 --> 01:27:33.479
Who was she?

01:27:33.562 --> 01:27:35.689
- She worked here.
- [Russell] No, she didn't.

01:27:36.398 --> 01:27:38.359
But you didn't fucking check, did you?

01:27:38.442 --> 01:27:42.029
You just handed our child
over to a stranger.

01:27:42.112 --> 01:27:45.282
Oh, Jesus! You're like a fucking toddler.

01:27:47.034 --> 01:27:48.994
I know. I'm sorry.

01:27:49.078 --> 01:27:50.120
[Russell] You're sorry.

01:27:50.579 --> 01:27:52.956
Where do you even begin to be sorry?

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:55.876
I saw her.

01:27:56.377 --> 01:28:00.631
Russell, I saw her on the train.
I know she's here. I know she's okay.

01:28:00.714 --> 01:28:03.592
- What train station?
- I don't remember. I don't...

01:28:03.675 --> 01:28:06.845
- What fucking train station?
- Red, the sign was red.

01:28:06.929 --> 01:28:08.889
The 1! Notify MTA.

01:28:10.766 --> 01:28:12.601
Do you remember which direction?

01:28:12.684 --> 01:28:14.561
I don't remember, I was running.

01:28:14.645 --> 01:28:16.313
I don't know, I'm sorry.

01:28:18.315 --> 01:28:19.483
I was so close.

01:28:19.566 --> 01:28:20.984
Her little face!

01:28:21.068 --> 01:28:22.736
[Carolyn] She was right there.

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.238
You don't deserve her, Carolyn.

01:28:24.321 --> 01:28:26.549
- I'm still her mother.
- [Russell] You don't deserve her.

01:28:26.573 --> 01:28:29.368
I'm her mother.
I want her back more than anything.

01:28:29.451 --> 01:28:33.038
I am trying, I am... I am.

01:28:33.122 --> 01:28:37.000
I just need some help. I need help.

01:28:37.084 --> 01:28:39.878
- Boss, can I get you to step out?
- I'm in the middle of something.

01:28:39.962 --> 01:28:41.562
[Officer Buck] We have some information.

[Richards] Give me a minute.

01:28:44.675 --> 01:28:47.094
- Squad got a call.
- Anonymous?

01:28:47.177 --> 01:28:49.930
The ex-husband of some woman,
said they had lunch at his place.

01:28:50.389 --> 01:28:51.908
[Richards] Tell me you got an address.

01:28:51.932 --> 01:28:53.212
- [Buck] Yeah.
- [Richards] Okay.

01:28:53.267 --> 01:28:54.560
If anything's happened to her...

01:28:55.853 --> 01:28:57.271
I'll kill myself.

I don't know how to help you.

01:29:39.855 --> 01:29:41.231
You're going to be fine.

01:29:42.608 --> 01:29:43.901

[Nico from a distance] Lu!

01:30:21.021 --> 01:30:22.021
Lu!

01:30:24.483 --> 01:30:25.817
Lu!

01:30:27.361 --> 01:30:28.362
Hey!

01:30:29.613 --> 01:30:32.074
I've been looking everywhere for you!

01:30:32.157 --> 01:30:34.034
My mom told me you just took off.

01:30:35.077 --> 01:30:38.080
Jesus Christ! Whose baby is this?

01:30:39.456 --> 01:30:41.291
I got to get her to a hospital.

01:31:07.442 --> 01:31:10.320
Open up! NYPD!

01:31:13.699 --> 01:31:15.033
Where's the baby?

01:31:17.286 --> 01:31:19.413
[Nico] Don't do this! You're not thinking.

01:31:19.496 --> 01:31:21.832
If you take her there,
then you are done, that is it.

01:31:21.915 --> 01:31:22.915
They have you!

01:31:23.917 --> 01:31:25.002
Shh!

01:31:25.877 --> 01:31:26.878
Hi, can I help you?

01:31:26.962 --> 01:31:28.130
My baby's sick.

01:31:28.213 --> 01:31:30.215
Okay, miss. If you can fill this out,

01:31:30.299 --> 01:31:32.580
and if you have an insurance card,
I'll need that as well.

01:31:38.348 --> 01:31:39.975
You have got to get out of here.

01:31:40.225 --> 01:31:41.744
I can't answer any of these questions.

01:31:41.768 --> 01:31:43.979
They will arrest you, Lu.
This is kidnapping!

01:31:44.062 --> 01:31:46.648
Fuck you! Where have you been?

01:31:47.774 --> 01:31:49.934
I wanted to see my mom,
and then I couldn't, all right?

01:31:50.694 --> 01:31:52.779
It was fucked up for you to
get her involved.

01:31:52.863 --> 01:31:53.864
You had no right to.

01:31:53.947 --> 01:31:55.782
Yeah, I had nowhere else to go.

01:31:56.116 --> 01:31:57.116
Fuck!

01:32:02.205 --> 01:32:04.416
I don't have any insurance.

01:32:04.499 --> 01:32:06.251
Can you wait to see a regular doctor?

01:32:06.335 --> 01:32:08.128
The emergency room is going to cost you.

01:32:08.211 --> 01:32:09.963
You know, I'm really worried about her

01:32:10.047 --> 01:32:12.132
because she's sweating
and not breathing right.

01:32:12.215 --> 01:32:15.302
All right. Just fill out this form.

01:32:15.385 --> 01:32:17.387
This is for allergies,
if she has any, okay?

01:32:18.305 --> 01:32:21.558
Is that important?

01:32:22.392 --> 01:32:23.477
Yes.

01:32:25.687 --> 01:32:27.522
I don't know if she has any allergies.

01:32:27.606 --> 01:32:29.191
Okay. And has she had her shots?

01:32:29.649 --> 01:32:30.649
I don't know.

01:32:31.985 --> 01:32:33.028
Okay, how old is she?

01:32:37.115 --> 01:32:38.492
You're not the mother.

01:32:38.575 --> 01:32:40.285
What is your relationship to the child?

01:32:40.369 --> 01:32:42.412
I found her. She was abandoned.

01:32:43.413 --> 01:32:45.165
Let me get somebody to help you, okay?

01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:52.339
I found her in the park.

01:32:52.422 --> 01:32:55.675
Someone left her in the bushes,
I had nothing to do with taking her.

01:32:55.759 --> 01:32:58.011
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just get out of the city!

01:32:58.095 --> 01:32:59.304
- Where do I go?
- Go wherever.

01:32:59.388 --> 01:33:01.515
Go to India, but you gotta disappear.

01:33:02.015 --> 01:33:03.183
I can't.

01:33:03.266 --> 01:33:04.726
You don't have a choice.

01:33:05.727 --> 01:33:08.730
[whispers] Hey, hey baby.

01:33:09.314 --> 01:33:11.441
Run! Run!

01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:14.653
[baby crying loudly]

01:33:18.031 --> 01:33:20.992
[distant siren]
[indistinct conversation]

01:33:42.681 --> 01:33:44.850
Um, can I get you anything?

01:33:47.686 --> 01:33:49.729
- Coffee.
- All right.

01:33:53.108 --> 01:33:55.735
- Do you take anything?
- No, it's fine.

01:34:04.536 --> 01:34:06.788
I'm so sorry.

01:34:07.414 --> 01:34:08.790
You didn't know.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.087
She's a beautiful little girl.

01:34:20.469 --> 01:34:22.012
He's gonna leave me.

01:34:24.014 --> 01:34:25.098
[Margo] Who?

01:34:25.682 --> 01:34:27.100
My husband.

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:32.022
I thought maybe if I found her myself,
he might forgive me.

01:34:33.523 --> 01:34:34.649
Of course he will.

01:34:36.359 --> 01:34:38.612
Can I smoke a cigarette, please?

01:34:39.571 --> 01:34:43.783
Oh, yes. Hmm...

01:34:57.839 --> 01:35:01.676
My whole family kept telling me
how lucky I was to have him.

01:35:02.177 --> 01:35:05.180
I don't know what I'd be doing
if it weren't for him.

01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:09.017
They kept telling me
I should count my blessings,

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:10.685
that he even married me.

01:35:15.565 --> 01:35:18.026
Now he's done with me. Huh!

01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:22.155
And I lost my child.

01:35:22.239 --> 01:35:25.033
[heavy sigh]

01:35:26.201 --> 01:35:28.578
Can't imagine what
this must be like for you.

01:35:33.625 --> 01:35:35.001
I wished for it.

01:35:37.337 --> 01:35:38.338
What?

01:35:39.089 --> 01:35:40.590
I wished for it.

01:35:42.008 --> 01:35:45.512
I wished so many times for it to happen.

01:35:46.054 --> 01:35:50.308
If only I'd never had her!
If only she was gone!

01:35:51.685 --> 01:35:52.811
You don't mean that.

01:35:52.894 --> 01:35:57.107
I did, I did mean that.
Isn't that terrible?

01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:04.864
I kept waiting for it to happen,
some mommy feeling,

01:36:04.948 --> 01:36:06.616
but it never came.

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.702
And I was so mad at her.

01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:12.831
He didn't pay me any attention before,

01:36:12.914 --> 01:36:15.125
so I thought, maybe, if I had a baby,

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:17.460
he'd be interested.

01:36:17.544 --> 01:36:18.878
But it's the opposite.

01:36:18.962 --> 01:36:22.674
It's... it's... so lonely...

01:36:26.636 --> 01:36:28.513
Am I a horrible person?

01:36:31.141 --> 01:36:32.267
We're all horrible.

01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:35.645
And we're all just people.

01:36:37.564 --> 01:36:40.150

01:37:15.477 --> 01:37:17.604

01:37:27.947 --> 01:37:29.616
I'm sorry.

01:37:31.159 --> 01:37:32.077
She's not mine,

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.954
I took her from this woman who, you know,

01:37:35.038 --> 01:37:37.540
<i>I thought she couldn't
take care of her and...</i>

01:37:39.626 --> 01:37:40.746
<i>I didn't mean to lie to you.</i>

01:37:40.794 --> 01:37:43.672
I just needed help
because I had nowhere else to go.

01:37:44.172 --> 01:37:46.549
- Where are you?
- [Tallulah] <i>She's at the hospital.</i>

01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:48.802
[Margo] <i>What hospital?</i>

01:37:48.885 --> 01:37:50.762
First Presbyterian, with Nico.

01:37:51.304 --> 01:37:52.472
Nico?

01:37:52.555 --> 01:37:55.350
<i>Yeah, I wanted to stay
but he told me to go.</i>

01:37:56.768 --> 01:37:58.103
Honey, is she sick?

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.523
Yeah.

01:38:04.734 --> 01:38:06.736
You've done a really bad thing.

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:10.615
I thought it was the right thing,
that's the only reason I did it.

01:38:13.118 --> 01:38:14.536
Where are you going?

01:38:15.412 --> 01:38:17.789
- I'm sorry <i>.</i>
- [Margo] <i>Lu?</i>

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:26.548
Okay. We got her.
Let's get somebody over there now.

01:39:52.926 --> 01:39:54.469
Don't move!

01:39:54.969 --> 01:39:57.347
Stay right where you are,
hand over the child.

01:39:57.430 --> 01:40:00.308
What, to her? She doesn't want it.

01:40:00.391 --> 01:40:01.684

01:40:01.768 --> 01:40:03.603
She's so little.

You don't even care!

01:40:06.856 --> 01:40:09.484
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Hand over the child.

01:40:09.567 --> 01:40:10.777
She doesn't want her.

01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.695
Ask her. Ask her, right now.

01:40:12.779 --> 01:40:13.947
[Tallulah] Do you?

01:40:15.448 --> 01:40:16.448
Do you?

01:40:18.076 --> 01:40:21.412
I do. I do... Please.

We're holding her downtown
until official charges are filed.

01:41:24.809 --> 01:41:27.049
- [Margo] After that?
- That's up to the court to decide.

01:41:28.438 --> 01:41:30.607
I'm gonna find a way to get you home.

01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:33.359
