WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:06.407
Okay. I'll miss you.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.709
Well, I mean, I can't go
till you close the door.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.512
(laughs) You go,
and then I'll close the door.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.581
No, you know what, you close
the door, then I'll go.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.049
(laughs)

00:17.851 --> 00:19.587
What a nice kid, huh?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.622
Go do your homework.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.393
Hey, is Katie's new boyfriend
still here?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.661
No, he just left
so she could do her homework.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.729
What a doll.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.231
Oh, he is no doll.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.433
Guess what I just found out.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.335
Tyler is a pothead.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.105
What?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.107
Yeah. I saw Brenda Miller
at the gas station,

00:39.140 --> 00:41.175
and she told me
that she found a bag of weed

00:41.209 --> 00:42.843
in her son Evan's room.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.745
Oh, my God.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.115
I don't know
who any of those people are.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.751
Brenda Miller, the nose job mom.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.620
And her son Evan is the one
you call Chicken Legs.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.355
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.758
Anyway, Tyler and Chicken Legs
are in a band together, right?

00:57.791 --> 01:01.262
And Chicken Legs told Nose Job
that the whole band smokes it.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.297
They practice in
Nose Job's basement.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.865
And they almost
got away with it,

01:04.898 --> 01:07.168
because Nose Job,
she can't smell anymore.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.371
Okay, look, all I'm saying is

01:10.404 --> 01:11.872
Katie has to break up
with Tyler.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.141
Pot is bad news.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.442
I know. You've
told me many times.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.443
Yeah, well,

01:15.476 --> 01:16.510
when I was growing up,

01:16.544 --> 01:18.346
my dad was a zero tolerance...

01:18.379 --> 01:19.780
BOTH:
"Just say no" hard-ass.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.515
Yeah, yeah.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.850
It was embarrassing,
but you know what?

01:22.883 --> 01:24.385
BOTH:
It worked.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.487
Don and I never
touched the stuff.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.821
BOTH:
And we were the better for it.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.724
Nobody likes that,
you know.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.161
But I'm not saying
I want Kate to do it,

01:33.194 --> 01:35.163
but pot's just not that
big a deal anymore.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.198
Yeah, that's
the problem, Andi.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.167
Because everybody's
stoned now.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.701
The jelly heads
in the burrito truck

01:40.734 --> 01:43.904
have not gotten my order right
in six years.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.706
And they don't care.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.509
They're too busy
puffing the magic dragon.

01:48.542 --> 01:52.180
Okay, honey, I-I get
that a badly made burrito

01:52.213 --> 01:53.481
is a real heartbreaker.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.183
(chuckles):
Yeah.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.819
But I say we just stay calm and
ask Kate if she's ever done it.

01:58.852 --> 01:59.953
Yes. Yes.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.423
And I think we both know
what's gonna happen if she has.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.457
(chuckling):
Ho-ho-ho-ho...

02:03.491 --> 02:05.259
Ho-ho-ho-ho...

02:05.293 --> 02:06.460
BOTH (chuckling):
Yeah.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.162
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.930
What, what,
what, what, what?

02:09.963 --> 02:13.401
Don't just barge in there
and ask her, okay?

02:13.434 --> 02:14.635
Let it organically come up.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.204
Come on, don't worry.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.239
I will be so sly,
she won't even know I'm asking.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.240
(laughs maniacally)

02:19.273 --> 02:20.274
Shh.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.415
Hi, sweetie.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.682
Hey, what's up?

02:28.716 --> 02:30.451
(sighs) Well, I been
pretty stressed.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.852
You got any
pot on you?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.621
What?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.622
Adam.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.856
That wasn't a no.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.793
*

02:49.503 --> 02:51.872
Don't you walk away from us,
young lady.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.275
Why are you asking
me about this?

02:54.308 --> 02:57.845
Because your boyfriend
smokes the devil's lettuce!

02:57.878 --> 02:59.413
What?

02:59.447 --> 03:00.748
Smokes pot.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.951
Your... your father
was born a long time ago.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.919
Well, I've never
seen Tyler do it.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.322
(scoffs)
And you've never done it?

03:08.356 --> 03:10.491
No! Look, I don't
have to do something

03:10.524 --> 03:11.659
just because my boyfriend does.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.893
You taught me that.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.662
Aw, I did!

03:14.695 --> 03:15.596
Aw.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.997
That makes me feel so good

03:17.030 --> 03:18.966
that you listened to me.
(chuckles)

03:20.534 --> 03:22.570
Will you stay focused?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.738
You have to break up with Tyler.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.607
You don't even
know him.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.576
I've known a hundred Tylers,
and they all end up

03:28.609 --> 03:31.345
in a food truck
screwing up my burrito.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.447
You can't stop me
from seeing him.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.449
Oh!

03:35.483 --> 03:36.750
I sure can.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.552
I will ground you.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.787
Tyler goes to my school.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.489
You gonna ground me
from school?

03:51.632 --> 03:54.502
Why you looking at her?

03:54.535 --> 03:55.803
You got nothing.

04:03.777 --> 04:08.282
When she traps me in an
argument like that, step in.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.883
Come on.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.852
Our daughter
is not a stoner.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.787
Yet. Yet.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.689
But if she keeps
hanging out with Tyler,

04:15.723 --> 04:16.790
it's just a matter of time

04:16.824 --> 04:19.427
before she's the mayor
of Doobieville.

04:19.460 --> 04:23.631
Okay, well, I trust her
to make good choices.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.800
(scoffs) Will you stop being
so trusting and supportive?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.436
That is no way to raise kids.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.338
You know what?
You're off the case.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.905
I'll handle this myself.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you gonna do?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.809
I'm not telling you
because you are off the case.

04:35.843 --> 04:39.347
Huh? Well, I think you're not
telling me 'cause Kate's right.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.048
You got nothing.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.583
Hey, okay.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.352
Just 'cause I don't know
what I'm gonna do

04:44.385 --> 04:45.786
doesn't mean
I'm not gonna do it.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.660
Hey, get this.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.762
Katie's dating
Cheech and Chong.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.830
Two guys-- that's rough.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.767
No, no, it's just one guy,
and he's a pothead.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.535
My daughter's dating a pothead.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.338
So what are you gonna do?

05:04.372 --> 05:06.006
I'm not sure.
It's complicated.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.508
Andi's not on my side.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.043
She's a hippie
sympathizer.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.445
Maybe she's right.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.880
Just let it go,
see what happens.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.682
That's what I did
with my son Mikey.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.985
And now he's assistant manager
at a pumpkin patch.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.589
So he works
one month a year?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.858
Yeah, you should get on this.

05:24.892 --> 05:28.696
I think what I need to do is
confront the boyfriend, Tyler.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.432
Let him know whose daughter
he's messing with.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.833
I dated a girl in college
who was into that.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.868
Renee Birnbaum.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.404
She stole my heart.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.971
And my dad's Subaru.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.612
Oh, well.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.448
If it isn't my at-risk youth
and her enabling mother.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.983
It might interest
you both to know

05:50.017 --> 05:52.553
that I called Tyler, and he's
coming over here this afternoon

05:52.586 --> 05:55.423
for a little talk,
man to space cowboy.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.660
Oh, my God.
(scoffs)

05:59.693 --> 06:01.061
If I wasn't already
not speaking to you,

06:01.094 --> 06:03.130
I would totally start
not speaking to you now.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.634
You'll thank me one day

06:06.667 --> 06:08.836
when you're not running
a pumpkin patch!

06:11.138 --> 06:12.706
Adam, what are you doing?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.508
Walking in here,
hollering at your daughter?

06:14.542 --> 06:18.512
I mean, (scoffs) you're like
the dad from Footloose.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.113
Hey, hey, that guy
made some good points.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.517
I was the only one in
the theater rooting for him.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.920
I just think you're taking
this a little too far.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.156
Andi, we have two more kids
that are gonna be teenagers.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.525
If we lose Katie,
we will lose them.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.161
They'll be gone
in a literal puff of smoke.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.900
You know, I'm pretty sure
I told you that, um,

06:39.933 --> 06:41.869
I indulged to a small
degree in college.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.970
Yeah.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.506
You said you tried it,
didn't like it and moved on.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.808
Well, that's what I said

06:47.841 --> 06:50.811
because I know how you
feel about it, but, um...

06:50.844 --> 06:51.812
(mumbles):
I don't know.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.981
I kinda liked it.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.916
Oh, really?

06:55.949 --> 06:58.185
And how often did you
"kinda like it"?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.888
Oh, not that much.
Like, once a month.

07:00.921 --> 07:01.955
Yeah.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.957
And weekends.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.928
Oh, and I didn't have class
on Wednesday, so Wednesdays.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.163
And then Tuesday night
because I didn't have to

07:10.197 --> 07:12.666
wake up for the--
you know.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.835
Hair of the dog
Thursday morning.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.838
Yeah, I should've known.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.674
This totally explains why you're
not on my side with this thing.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.176
And why you're so good
at making taquitos.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.951
Look, obviously I don't
want Kate to do it,

07:30.984 --> 07:33.186
but it's not worse than staying
out all night or drinking beer

07:33.220 --> 07:35.856
or any of the other things
that we don't want her to do.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.959
Okay, look, I am clearly
not getting through to you.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.195
Maybe it's because your brain is
floating around in bong water.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.000
So you know what? I'm gonna let
the guy who got through to me

07:47.034 --> 07:50.571
get through to you: my dad,
Mr. Zero Tolerance himself.

07:50.604 --> 07:55.008
So, Katie's boyfriend
enjoys a little reefer.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.111
Yeah, yeah. And this one's
fine with the kids doing it.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.548
And drinking beer
and staying out all night.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.481
Oh, Andi.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.851
I never said that.
He's making stuff up.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.954
So, Dad, hit her with
the full "Just say no" speech.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.221
And take your time with it.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.859
I'm gonna enjoy a little snack
while you scare her straight.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.861
Hey, what happened
to the cookies?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.229
Well, my opinion of
marijuana has changed.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.032
In fact, I've started to
partake a bit myself.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.869
What?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.604
That's what happened
to the cookies.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.242
My buddy Jerry down at the
VFW has a prescription.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.944
It's dynamite
for my arthritis,

08:30.978 --> 08:33.313
and it's not bad for
everything else, too.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.116
Well, I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.318
Wh-What happened
to zero tolerance?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.622
I'm in my golden years, son.
I want them to be groovy.

08:43.323 --> 08:47.294
This could not have turned out
any better for me.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.630
Mom, you're okay with this?

08:49.663 --> 08:52.099
I'm all for it.
He i groovier now.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.002
Last week,
he took me dancing.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.838
Ah. And then we came home
and we did some more dancing.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.872
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.676
Yeah, that's probably gonna
creep into a dream.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.579
Well, don't worry
your little jelly head.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.048
I'm sure you'll forget
all about it tomorrow.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.684
Hey, look, you're my dad,
so I'm not gonna tell you

09:10.718 --> 09:13.721
how to live your life.
You smoke whatever you want.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.989
Okay, but my side of the family
is staying clean and sober.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.091
And to register my disapproval,

09:18.125 --> 09:21.028
I'm eating your last two
bear candies.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.731
Andi... I'll be in the car

09:23.764 --> 09:25.999
when you're done with Bob Marley
and the Wailers over there.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.803
Okay, well, I
should get going.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.104
Keep on trucking, man.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.040
Yeah.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.043
Funny thing is nobody
smokes pot anymore.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.745
They eat it.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.648
In things like
little bear candies.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.985
Wait.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.720
Those bear candies?

09:46.754 --> 09:47.821
Uh-huh.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.289
I usually go with
half a bear,

09:49.322 --> 09:52.025
but if Adam wants to go
with two, that's cool.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.673
Well, he seems fine.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.074
But we have to tell him, right?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.642
Don't do that.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.778
He's such a buzz kill.
I don't need the static.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.647
No, Andi,
I've read up on this,

10:13.681 --> 10:16.650
and there are some people
it just doesn't affect.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.687
Okay, well, when will we know
if it's affecting him?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.889
Guys!

10:23.190 --> 10:25.926
I just put all of
our chips and candy

10:25.959 --> 10:28.328
into the same bowl.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.664
Now. I think now
is when we know.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.266
I finally got
the ratio right.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.269
Turns out you need twice
as many chips as candy.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.672
Yeah. At first, I thought
it was the other way around,

10:38.706 --> 10:40.440
but-but it isn't.
No, I did the math.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.009
Oh.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.211
That's just our phone number
over and over again.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.447
(clears throat)

10:47.480 --> 10:49.817
Look, honey,
there's something that...

10:49.850 --> 10:51.852
Raisins! Raisins!

10:54.187 --> 10:56.356
I'm excited to see
what he does with the raisins.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.691
Yeah.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.160
Dad texted me. Where's Adam?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.862
Is he flying?

11:01.895 --> 11:04.431
Guys!

11:04.464 --> 11:08.936
Look, honey, it's my brother Don
and my Lowell.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.138
(grunts)

11:11.171 --> 11:12.405
You're so tall.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.442
(laughs, sighs)

11:15.475 --> 11:16.543
You smell like vanilla.

11:16.576 --> 11:20.447
I've been kind of messing around
with some body spray.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.449
Hey. Hey.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.284
You know what
I was thinking?

11:24.317 --> 11:28.055
Why do cowboys
always try to ride bulls?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.758
The bulls don't like it.
They get so mad.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.426
Let me answer your question
with a question.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.527
ADAM:
Yeah.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.697
Why do they call them "cowboys"
if they ride bulls?

11:42.435 --> 11:43.837
(gasps)

11:43.871 --> 11:45.305
I'm gonna make Kool-Aid.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.143
I love watching
my two boys get along.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.745
I don't care
if it's drug-induced.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.414
It warms my heart.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.783
(doorbell rings)

11:55.816 --> 11:57.250
Oh, God, who's that?

11:57.284 --> 12:00.187
If it's the cops, he didn't
get that stuff from me.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.057
My goodness, life with you
has gotten so exciting.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.159
Okay, well, whoever it is,
I'll get rid of them.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.362
We can't have Adam
around people right now.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.365
Oh, no.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.235
Hey, Mrs. Burns. Your husband
said he wanted to talk to me.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.736
We don't have any Kool-- Tyler!

12:17.570 --> 12:18.538
Okay, come on.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.439
Let's go out
to the garage.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.209
You and me need to
have a little talk.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.278
Ooh, did you make that?
That looks good.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.817
Should I go out there
and stop this?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.284
I think you should go out there
and record this.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.787
I can't let him

12:33.821 --> 12:35.889
talk to Tyler in that state?

12:35.923 --> 12:38.792
Why not? It's just
two stoned guys talking.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.028
Voice of experience:
much will be said,

12:41.061 --> 12:44.131
little will be remembered,
and nothing will be done.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.142
Here's the thing, Tyler.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.144
I can always tell
when someone's high.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.480
Their eyes are red,
they repeat themselves,

13:00.513 --> 13:03.550
they have red eyes, and they are
constantly repeating themselves.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.854
I feel like you're trying
to ask me if I smoke pot.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.823
Oh, we'll get to that.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.159
But first,
would you like a Frito

13:12.192 --> 13:14.862
with an M&M and a raisin
tucked right in the curly part?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.032
No, thank you.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.368
Look, Mr. Burns,
I-I really like Kate.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.502
Me, too.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.504
And I want to be
honest with you.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.874
Great.

13:26.907 --> 13:27.908
I did smoke pot.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.543
I knew it.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.246
You know, one of your ears
is slightly bigger

13:33.280 --> 13:37.050
than the other one,
and it is freaking me out.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.920
Anyways, look, I'm in this band,

13:39.953 --> 13:41.889
and everyone else
was smoking pot.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.256
(gasps)

13:43.290 --> 13:44.624
But I work weekends
at a burger place,

13:44.657 --> 13:46.626
and I kept getting
people's orders wrong.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.029
I-I couldn't live
like that, so...

13:49.062 --> 13:50.563
I don't do it anymore.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.233
Wait a minute.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.035
Are you saying you quit weed

13:55.068 --> 13:57.070
because you wanted
to get people's orders right?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.538
Yeah.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.645
I'm so proud of you.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.646
Give me a hug.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.081
Mr. Burns...

14:08.115 --> 14:09.449
Hug me, Tyler.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.184
Yes, sir.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.921
Attaboy.

14:13.954 --> 14:14.955
Good.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.625
Are you always this friendly?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.263
No.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.598
Oh, here he comes.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.636
Guys, guys.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.339
I don't feel right.

14:34.307 --> 14:38.611
I-I think somebody put something
in my candy raisin chips bowl.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.614
(imitating slow-motion):
Calm down.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.254
(imitating slow-motion):
Everything is fine.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.961
Are you guys hearing this?

14:55.996 --> 15:00.200
(imitating slow-motion):
Hearing what?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.169
Andi! Andi!

15:02.202 --> 15:03.703
Okay, okay, okay.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.638
You guys have had your fun.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.077
Look, honey, there's something
you need to know.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.044
Well, can you tell me?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.413
Because if they do it,
it'll take forever.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.950
They are not gonna do it,

15:16.984 --> 15:18.451
because they have to
go home now.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.620
Yeah, let's get out of here
before she tells him he's high.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.654
Yeah.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.258
I'm high?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.460
Whoops.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.130
(imitating slow-motion):
See ya.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.966
Wait! Hold on!
Hold on a second!

15:35.602 --> 15:37.337
So this is high?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.676
(giggles)

15:47.114 --> 15:48.648
Well, hi, high.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.618
I'm funny high.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.752
Yeah.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.554
All this time,
and I never knew.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.024
W-Wait.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.658
Did you guys know
and not tell me?

15:58.691 --> 16:01.528
Well, you could've told me.
I love secrets.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.500
I was gonna tell you, but it
was, it was peer pressure. Yeah.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.736
Fell in with a bad crowd.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.540
Well, what about you guys?

16:13.573 --> 16:16.709
I really liked
what you did with the raisins.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.280
Wait, wait.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.050
How did this even happen?

16:23.083 --> 16:27.054
Let's just say that's what
you get for taking my candy.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.756
The bears!

16:31.458 --> 16:35.195
I am so angry!

16:35.228 --> 16:36.596
Wait, that-that
didn't come out right.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.598
I'm so angry.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.533
ANDI: Okay, honey, I think
maybe the best thing

16:40.567 --> 16:43.036
is for you to go upstairs
and sleep it off.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.238
(gasps) A nap! Oh.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.075
I love naps.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.742
(gasps)

16:49.776 --> 16:54.114
If this is reality,
I can't wait to see my dreams.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.826
Hey.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.328
Oh, you're up.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.696
How you feeling?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.298
Great. I have not had

17:11.331 --> 17:14.334
a good night's sleep
like that in forever.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.803
Honey, it's only 8:00 at night.

17:16.836 --> 17:20.173
That's gonna be a problem.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.808
So how much do you remember
about what happened today?

17:21.841 --> 17:24.077
Because you were spectacular.

17:24.111 --> 17:24.911
(chuckles)

17:24.944 --> 17:26.713
Uh, well, I learned
a few things.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.714
One,

17:27.747 --> 17:29.082
Tyler's a good kid.

17:29.116 --> 17:29.816
Two,

17:29.849 --> 17:31.651
weed is awesome.

17:31.684 --> 17:32.852
Three,

17:32.885 --> 17:34.421
it's not for me.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.124
No. I can't handle
being that groovy.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.092
I wrote a song on
our bedroom wall

17:39.126 --> 17:41.394
with your makeup pencil.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.730
You wrote a song?
(chuckles): Yeah.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.333
This I got to see.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.567
I'm gonna miss stoned Adam.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.805
Oh, Katie.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.507
Uh, I'm glad you're here.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.843
Uh, unless you're still
not ready to talk to me.

17:56.876 --> 18:00.380
Did you hug my boyfriend?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.182
Sounds like
you're not ready yet.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.483
Let's give it some time.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.287
Look...

18:07.320 --> 18:10.323
coming down on you
about him was a mistake.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.125
Really?

18:12.159 --> 18:13.426
Yeah.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.461
Sit down.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.469
Katie, I should've trusted you
that Tyler is a good kid.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.171
It's just,

18:24.204 --> 18:25.772
this is all new for me.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.275
You know, you're dating now,
and it's scary.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.643
So I overreact sometimes.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.179
Most times.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.813
A fair amount of times.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.848
A lot.
It's not about the numbers.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.320
Anyway...

18:40.353 --> 18:44.157
I am fine with you seeing Tyler.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.160
Thanks, Dad.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.428
Mm.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.799
And... if you ever want to hug
somebody, you can always hug me.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.868
I will take that every time.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.470
How about now?

18:57.504 --> 18:58.505
(laughs)

19:08.415 --> 19:10.283
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.318
Good and getting better.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.521
Looking for that snack bowl
you put together.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.958
(chuckles):
Uh, okay.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.762
You know how we say
never take candy from strangers?

19:22.795 --> 19:24.831
Let's put Grandpa on that list.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.833
No... mm-mm.
