SHEPPARD :
Medical team to my quarters.

35:02.127 --> 35:06.040
The synaptic activity in your brain
has reached over 90 percent.

35:06.207 --> 35:10.166
l don’t know why, but it seems the more
pervasive, evolved state of the cortex...

35:10.327 --> 35:12.602
... is causing lapses
in the lower brain function.

35:12.807 --> 35:16.720
It’s almost as if your body is losing
its natural ability to keep itself alive.

35:16.887 --> 35:18.718
When Ascension occurs naturally...

35:18.887 --> 35:21.765
... the physical body’s no longer
necessary in the final stages.

35:21.927 --> 35:24.236
Rodney, l don’t know how much more
you can take.

35:25.327 --> 35:26.601
About six percent.

35:27.087 --> 35:28.805
There must be something we can do.

It’s okay.

35:30.927 --> 35:32.121
You know...

35:32.287 --> 35:35.643
... l’m actually feeling
a sense of peace.

35:36.447 --> 35:38.881
Interspersed with moments
of sheer terror, of course.

35:39.327 --> 35:43.366
Rodney,
as far as this Ascension thing...

35:43.687 --> 35:47.316
... l know you didn’t have much success.
But at this point...

35:47.567 --> 35:49.523
... what have you got to lose ?

35:49.687 --> 35:52.918
- May as well go out fighting, huh ?
- Absolutely.

35:54.487 --> 35:56.125
Hook me up.

35:59.647 --> 36:01.160
McKAY :
Carson.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.685
Thank you.

36:04.327 --> 36:06.124

Okay. Stop talking now.

Rodney, you’re a good person.

36:38.767 --> 36:39.995

You love me ?

36:44.927 --> 36:46.838
Really ? All of you ?

36:47.007 --> 36:50.238
In the way a friend
feels about another friend.

36:50.447 --> 36:53.120
You’re just saying that
because l’m gonna die.

36:53.807 --> 36:55.638
Oh, God.
l can’t believe l’m gonna die.

36:55.807 --> 36:58.719

BECKETT : You don’t understand.

37:25.487 --> 37:27.478
He just told me how to save him.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.277
We’re en route. His pulse is weak.
Are you ready ?

37:31.487 --> 37:33.125
We will be.

Almost.

37:43.247 --> 37:44.805
BECKETT :
Right.

SHEPPARD : Sounds like him.

38:12.967 --> 38:14.605

Yes, yes.

Oh, he’s fine.

And you said it was impossible.

38:34.847 --> 38:36.326
McKAY :
The answer just came to me.

38:36.487 --> 38:40.765
l was floating in this black emptiness
and the answer came out of nowhere.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.361
Look, the device was designed
to manipulate your DNA.

38:43.567 --> 38:46.559
It couldn’t reverse the process,
everyone’s DNA is different.

that causes the DNA...

specific to your own unique physiology.

38:52.167 --> 38:55.637
To manipulate the DNA, the program

39:57.327 --> 39:59.602
When the idea of how to save yourself
came to you.

39:59.767 --> 40:02.327
l thought about how hard it is
to rid oneself of ego.

40:02.487 --> 40:06.719
That existence without the individuality
of consciousness would be pointless--

40:07.047 --> 40:09.800
Ooh. That’s probably
what gave me the idea...

It’s true. You’ve said it.
Now l know. l suspected it.
