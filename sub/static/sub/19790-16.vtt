Previously on Young and Hungry...

00:01.866 --> 00:04.880
I'm spending the weekend taking
my best friend on a vacation!

00:04.893 --> 00:07.066
Where? Mexico?

00:07.133 --> 00:07.705
SÃ­!

00:07.741 --> 00:09.741
Sofia...

00:10.241 --> 00:11.474
may I kiss you?

00:12.577 --> 00:14.543
Sofia's gonna miss you so much.

00:14.579 --> 00:18.247
Man, I wish we could just pack you
up in our car and take you with us.

00:18.282 --> 00:21.544
You know, I don't remember
all these border patrol guys

00:21.555 --> 00:24.153
with like guns and angry dogs
and stuff when we came in.

00:24.188 --> 00:25.187
What's all that about?

00:25.223 --> 00:27.085
Relax, Gabi, we have nothing to hide.

00:27.104 --> 00:29.004
Unless you're smuggling something.

00:38.336 --> 00:42.271
Hi, Officer... "Ho-nez," is it?

00:42.306 --> 00:43.506
Thats "Jones."

00:44.642 --> 00:46.342
Do you have anything to declare?

00:46.377 --> 00:50.246
Just that these searchlights
make your eyes look beautiful.

00:50.281 --> 00:51.447
Gabi, what are you doing?

00:51.482 --> 00:54.149
Getting us home, Sofia. Getting us home.

00:54.185 --> 00:56.485
Go ahead and put the car in park.
I'm searching this vehicle.

01:00.558 --> 01:02.358
Sofia...

01:02.393 --> 01:05.160
there's something I have to tell you.

01:05.196 --> 01:06.495
Gonna pop the trunk, ma'am?

01:06.531 --> 01:10.232
You know, I'm not sure this car has one.

01:10.268 --> 01:12.201
Gabi, what is your problem?

01:15.239 --> 01:17.840
Yeah, see that's...
that's what I had to tell you.

01:18.476 --> 01:20.142
What did you do?

01:20.177 --> 01:22.344
Well, you were just so sad, and I
really wanted to see you happy.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.146
By getting us arrested?

01:24.181 --> 01:26.348
Oh, I see what you've been hiding.

01:26.384 --> 01:28.350
- Oh, my god, we're going to jail.
- Oh.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.154
You can not take
a mango across the border.

01:34.458 --> 01:38.160
It is illegal to bring
this into the U.S.

01:38.195 --> 01:40.429
Uh, we are so sorry, sir.
Please forgive us.

01:40.464 --> 01:43.232
Yes, we feel horrible.

01:43.267 --> 01:44.567
Don't do it again.

01:44.602 --> 01:48.404
You can go, but I'm keeping this.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.339
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Okay, let's get moving.

01:50.374 --> 01:51.574
Sofia, the car's not moving.

01:51.609 --> 01:53.309
- Why is the car not moving?
- The brake's on.

01:53.344 --> 01:54.543
- Oh.
- No, that's the trunk!

01:56.380 --> 01:57.546
Hold it!

01:58.583 --> 02:00.382
Hola.

02:21.172 --> 02:23.172
Thank God we didn't go to jail.

02:23.207 --> 02:25.307
I was already planning
on making you my prison bitch.

02:27.178 --> 02:28.177
But...

02:28.212 --> 02:29.511
they let us off with a warning,

02:29.547 --> 02:31.213
Juancarlo got to go home,

02:31.248 --> 02:33.215
and all's well that ends well.

02:34.251 --> 02:35.384
Did it really end well?

02:35.419 --> 02:37.119
Oh, my god.

02:37.154 --> 02:38.153
You just talked to me.

02:38.189 --> 02:39.154
In fact, I kind of think

02:39.190 --> 02:40.189
you even started yelling,

02:40.224 --> 02:41.190
which is good because

02:41.225 --> 02:42.224
you haven't said anything to me

02:42.259 --> 02:43.258
for two hours and you need

02:43.294 --> 02:44.259
to let it out, Sofia.

02:44.295 --> 02:45.427
I can't.

02:45.463 --> 02:47.563
Why? Because you're scared
you're going to yell at me?

02:47.598 --> 02:49.264
Because you're scared
you're going to cry?

02:49.300 --> 02:50.399
I don't know. Look,

02:50.434 --> 02:51.533
when we left the resort,

02:51.569 --> 02:52.568
I thought I was never

02:52.603 --> 02:54.169
gonna see Juancarlo again.

02:54.205 --> 02:55.304
And then in the car,

02:55.339 --> 02:56.372
I turned around

02:56.407 --> 02:57.406
and I saw his face, and...

02:57.441 --> 02:59.241
Oh, my god, it's the crying one.

02:59.276 --> 03:02.211
Ugh. God, we were so close.

03:02.246 --> 03:05.180
Where did it all go wrong?

03:07.451 --> 03:09.084
When you popped the trunk,

03:09.120 --> 03:10.252
and they found him.

03:11.389 --> 03:13.222
Yeah.

03:13.257 --> 03:15.324
But, what
