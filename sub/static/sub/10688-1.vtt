WEBVTT

01:40.759 --> 01:44.559
- Doctor.
- Now, just be easy, now.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.427
Take your time.
Let's not worry too quickly.

01:49.925 --> 01:51.774
- My husband...
- Yes?

01:52.067 --> 01:55.075
- My husband's in love.
- Of course.

01:55.162 --> 01:56.974
With a mermaid.

01:57.705 --> 02:01.126
- I beg your pardon.
- Mermaid, M-e-r...

02:01.225 --> 02:02.544
I can spell, thank you.

02:02.627 --> 02:04.251
A mermaid, eh?

02:04.361 --> 02:05.615
A blonde, I believe.

02:05.947 --> 02:10.693
And when you say mermaid,
you mean, I take it, a sort of fish?

02:10.735 --> 02:14.407
Only half, the other half,
I understand, is quite human.

02:14.442 --> 02:15.903
Oh, yes, of course.

02:15.982 --> 02:17.617
He caught her of the Island of St. Hilda's

02:17.626 --> 02:21.019
in the British West Indies
shortly after we arrived there in November.

02:21.172 --> 02:26.274
And since then... a whole woman
I could understand, I suppose, but...

02:26.376 --> 02:29.629
Did you ever see this creature yourself?

02:29.676 --> 02:32.862
- Only her tail.
- You saw her tail?

02:32.981 --> 02:34.300
In the bathtub once.

02:34.364 --> 02:38.227
- The mermaid was taking a bath?
- A bubble bath.

02:39.462 --> 02:44.803
If you'll pardon me, Mrs. Peabody, which of
you is the subject of this consultation,

02:44.835 --> 02:47.200
your husband or yourself?

02:47.397 --> 02:49.271
Why, Mr. Peabody, of course!

02:49.329 --> 02:52.224
Ah, yes, of course, I just wanted
to make sure, that's all.

02:55.491 --> 02:57.706
- Which one is he?
- Directly opposite...

02:57.936 --> 02:59.549
the tall, gloomy one.

03:14.497 --> 03:18.392
What's the matter with him, Mommy,
is he crazy?

03:18.404 --> 03:19.971
Sh, Darling!

03:21.088 --> 03:24.650
How did he say he got
mixed up with this... thing?

03:24.652 --> 03:25.652
He caught her in the bay.

03:25.654 --> 03:28.138
Oh, really! Casting or trolling?

03:28.166 --> 03:31.799
- Trolling, he says, with light tackle.
- How light?

03:31.816 --> 03:34.056
- A twelve thread line.
- What did she weigh?

03:34.503 --> 03:36.593
I'm sorry, I never weighed her.

03:36.647 --> 03:40.741
Well, if she ran over a hundred pounds,
that sounds like very good fishing to me.

03:41.135 --> 03:43.853
- May I?
- The one in the blue Cheviot.

03:44.269 --> 03:48.246
- Did she give him much of a fight?
- Neither then nor since, apparently.

03:55.767 --> 03:59.653
But, look at his eyes,
I bet he IS crazy.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.269
Madam, unless that child is
a qualified psychiatrist

04:04.270 --> 04:06.769
I'll thank him to keep
his opinions to himself.

04:08.847 --> 04:10.197
Mr. Peabody.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.740
Darling, this is Dr. Harvey.

04:20.822 --> 04:22.568
- How do you do?
- How do you...

04:22.634 --> 04:26.106
- Oh... how do you do?
- Well...

04:26.207 --> 04:28.373
Well, what does he want to do? Operate?

04:28.516 --> 04:32.187
Oh! He just wants to
talk to you, Dear, about Lee.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.422
- Her name was Lenore.
- Lenore.

04:36.334 --> 04:37.232
Lenore.

04:37.267 --> 04:42.086
- Well, I'll wait outside.
- No, not out there, that's a human zoo.

04:42.372 --> 04:46.108
Ya know, I think it'd be better if you
went back to the hotel and waited.

04:46.143 --> 04:49.651
All right, goodbye, Doctor, and thank you.

04:49.686 --> 04:50.899
Goodbye.

04:50.934 --> 04:52.688
- Goodbye, Dear.
- Goodbye.

04:55.007 --> 04:56.284
Will you sit down?

04:58.338 --> 04:59.382
Thank you.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.143
Well, now, let's get this
straight at once, Doctor,

05:05.778 --> 05:10.208
I'm quite willing to tell you everything that
happened, because Mrs. Peabody wishes me to.

05:10.850 --> 05:16.023
But I'm not a Looney, and I'm not interested
in any opinion you may form on that subject.

05:16.163 --> 05:16.815
I understand.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.646
If you want to hear the story
on that condition, very well, if not...

05:21.279 --> 05:25.140
Is it right, you caught
her on a 12 thread line?

05:25.175 --> 05:26.923
- You fish?
- Some.

05:27.801 --> 05:32.133
Well, to tell the truth, I didn't actually
hook her, I snagged her in the tail.

05:32.168 --> 05:33.248
Did it hurt her?

05:33.341 --> 05:37.574
No thank heaven, I don't think she even
felt it, never gave any sign of it, anyway.

05:38.040 --> 05:42.147
- And her name was Lenore?
- It was to me!

05:42.182 --> 05:43.883
Would you care to tell me about it?

05:46.084 --> 05:47.935
Well...

05:49.019 --> 05:52.873
We're Bostonians,
as Mrs. Peabody probably told you.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.393
Born, bred and married there.

05:56.436 --> 06:02.221
Well, last fall I had rather a bad case of
flu, kept me in bed for nearly a month.

06:02.441 --> 06:04.929
Even then I was still weak and shaky.

06:05.330 --> 06:09.698
And that's why we decided, both of us,
to put in the whole winter as a holiday...

06:09.933 --> 06:11.644
for me to convalesce.

06:12.026 --> 06:17.437
So we turned our youngster, Priscilla, over to
her grandmother and we went to St. Hilda's.

06:18.072 --> 06:20.649
That's a small British
Island in the Caribbean.

06:21.332 --> 06:25.466
Very tropical, very beautiful,
and no tourists... yet.

06:26.434 --> 06:29.177
The house we rented on the beach,
The Villa Marina,

06:29.412 --> 06:33.956
was more than we could afford, really...
it was all so wonderful...

06:34.291 --> 06:35.938
like heaven to both of us.

06:36.693 --> 06:40.919
And if you can find a little piece
of heaven, who cares what it costs.

06:41.765 --> 06:46.237
Well, that's where it all began,
the very first morning we were there.

06:55.211 --> 06:56.597
Polly...

07:02.470 --> 07:05.428
- It's the surf, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

07:06.183 --> 07:09.305
You ever see anything
that reminds you less of Boston?

07:10.244 --> 07:12.128
Look at that blue.

07:14.295 --> 07:15.348
Aren't you cold?

07:15.583 --> 07:18.307
Huh? Oh, no! I feel great.

07:18.442 --> 07:20.900
Say, wouldn't Priscilla
have loved this though?

07:21.235 --> 07:23.443
I'm sorry now we didn't bring her along.

07:25.666 --> 07:29.538
- I'll get you a robe.
- No, no, no, I don't need it, really.

07:29.539 --> 07:30.639
Good morning, Sir.

07:31.389 --> 07:35.001
- Oh, good morning, Basil, is it?
- Yes, Sir.

07:35.558 --> 07:39.349
- Do you have many mornings like this?
- Lots of them, Sir.

07:39.940 --> 07:42.200
- Good morning, Madam.
- Morning, Basil.

07:43.373 --> 07:45.062
The air is damp and you've been sick.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.863
Hey, look! Is that a flamingo?

07:51.006 --> 07:53.839
A man doesn't get his strength back
so quickly at your age, remember?

07:54.331 --> 07:55.692
Watch him go.

07:57.715 --> 07:59.394
My age?

07:59.729 --> 08:02.341
At 50, I mean, it takes
a little longer to recover.

08:04.001 --> 08:04.002
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ
which is Greek to me.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.701
And who, if I may ask, is 50?

08:08.784 --> 08:10.365
You, if I may answer.

08:11.805 --> 08:15.010
It just happens that I'm 48, if you
really want to be accurate about it.

08:15.389 --> 08:18.309
Or if you really want to be
accurate about it, you're 49.

08:20.203 --> 08:22.201
Until next Thursday, anyway.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.244
- No.
- Yes.

08:25.450 --> 08:28.277
- You sure?
- Confident.

08:30.512 --> 08:36.855
- Why, does it hurt, Darling?
- Huh? Oh! No, of course not.

08:37.871 --> 08:41.107
Ah... just a little surprised,
that's all, that's...

08:41.109 --> 08:43.611
I just wasn't expecting it...
this year.

08:44.707 --> 08:47.090
- Sneaked-up on ya, huh?
- Hm?

08:47.851 --> 08:51.602
Well, you're taking it very bravely, I see.

08:51.737 --> 08:52.742
You bet!

08:53.856 --> 08:57.600
A wife doesn't really begin to feel safe, you
know, until her husband turns that 50 corner.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.101
Fifty...

09:29.121 --> 09:31.323
- Feeding the fish?
- Yes, Sir.

09:36.079 --> 09:40.723
- Basil, how old are you?
- Thirty-two, Sir.

09:43.638 --> 09:45.048
How disgusting.

10:26.518 --> 10:28.766
Fifty...

10:29.421 --> 10:31.891
The old age of youth.

10:32.711 --> 10:34.942
The youth of old age.

10:35.764 --> 10:37.168
You all right, Sir?

10:39.362 --> 10:40.665
No.

10:42.151 --> 10:46.554
But I don't know that there's anything
that anybody but GOD can do about it.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.143
No, Sir.

11:13.649 --> 11:16.560
- Who is that?
- Who's what, Sir?

11:16.661 --> 11:19.663
- That singing.
- I didn't hear it, Sir.

11:19.864 --> 11:21.312
Well, it's somebody...

11:22.800 --> 11:26.591
Listen, there it is again.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.310
- You heard it then, didn't you?
- No, Sir!

11:41.648 --> 11:43.642
Like a woman singing.

11:45.584 --> 11:49.304
Hey, could it come from that
little island out there?

11:50.008 --> 11:55.936
No, Sir, that's not an island,
not rightly, it's a key... Kiura.

11:56.271 --> 11:58.576
Couldn't somebody swim out there?

11:58.837 --> 12:03.619
No, Sir, that's black water out there,
full of sharks and barracudas.

12:03.754 --> 12:06.985
But, by George, I see
somebody there now, look!

12:07.650 --> 12:09.619
Couldn't be, Sir.

12:10.436 --> 12:14.836
Seems to be gone now,
but... but I saw it all right.

12:16.586 --> 12:20.510
And once more, it looked to ME like a girl.

12:24.072 --> 12:28.091
The still, sweet fall of music far away.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.075
Shut up!

14:13.317 --> 14:16.277
At the Cabaña Club's
beach party that Saturday night

14:17.216 --> 14:21.890
I looked about for someone who might be able
to shed a little light on this marine concert.

14:30.184 --> 14:32.175
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.538
- I'll have a Rum Collins, please.
- Yes, Sir.

14:36.554 --> 14:38.461
Will you join me, Sir?

14:40.058 --> 14:42.701
I say, you join me in a drink, Sir?

14:43.363 --> 14:46.492
- Are you American?
- Why, yes.

14:48.793 --> 14:50.094
Then listen.

14:50.329 --> 14:52.871
About a week ago
I had a very severe headache,

14:53.006 --> 14:56.341
so my girlfriend makes me go
to this doctor, so, all right.

14:56.576 --> 15:00.085
Well, this first thing he does, he...
he takes my blood pressure, it's too low.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.796
Then he plugs me in on a
basal metabolism, it's too high.

15:04.031 --> 15:07.089
Then he checks my heart, it's too weak.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.607
When he x-rays me, I'm... I'm out of focus.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.228
When I'm fluoroscoped, the
liver has disappeared.

15:12.263 --> 15:13.835
So what do you think he says?

15:13.870 --> 15:16.344
- What?
- Give up cigarettes.

15:17.304 --> 15:19.273
- I'll have a beer.
- Yes, Sir.

15:19.308 --> 15:23.388
- Well, what did he say was the matter with you?
- He don't know, he's baffled.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.924
All he knows is: Give up cigarettes.

15:27.077 --> 15:30.228
- For how long?
- Just 'til I go crazy.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.064
Is he a first rate man?

15:32.099 --> 15:36.383
He's a quack, a notorious quack, other
people wouldn't even send their dog to him.

15:36.526 --> 15:38.234
Well, then, why do you go to him?

15:40.210 --> 15:44.592
He's my girlfriend's brother.
Happy days.

15:46.614 --> 15:48.087
But I must warn you, my Dearest,

15:48.146 --> 15:51.615
Major Hadley is responsible for
MORE grey hairs among the married men

15:51.650 --> 15:54.339
than ANY other bachelor in St. Hilda's.

15:55.244 --> 15:58.544
- I'm so unscrupulous.
- An Englishman and NOT a gentleman?

15:58.579 --> 16:00.983
- Oh! Good heavens, no!
- I must remember that.

16:01.018 --> 16:05.182
Not that it'll do you any good,
he's completely taken now, body and soul.

16:05.217 --> 16:08.647
- Aren't you, Dear?
- Well, just on approval.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.039
- By who?
- By Cathy... Cathy Livingston.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.140
Cathy Livingston, huh?

16:14.676 --> 16:18.066
Yeah, she could swim out to that key,
she's a great swimmer.

16:18.101 --> 16:24.825
- Why, you want to swim with her?
- Who me? Good heavens, no!

16:24.960 --> 16:29.307
With a good, stiff tail wind I might do
20 or 30 feet, but not much more.

16:29.642 --> 16:32.461
Is she here tonight, do you think?

16:34.590 --> 16:36.056
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

16:36.091 --> 16:40.482
Oh, I think it'll be all right if we go out
here where the wind'll blow it away.

16:40.717 --> 16:41.969
It's not necessary at all.

16:42.019 --> 16:45.119
She's out there now, slapping
away at all that wet stuff.

16:45.154 --> 16:47.320
- You've seen her?
- No, but that's what she's always doing

16:47.355 --> 16:50.281
at these seaside sociables,
swimming or singing.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.072
She sings, too?

16:53.207 --> 16:56.709
Stoddard Omby, he's out of
musical comedy, you know.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.602
You married?

17:02.857 --> 17:05.759
- Yes, but...
- Then you wouldn't be interested in...

17:11.491 --> 17:14.362
Oh, well, not right now, I'm afraid.

17:14.813 --> 17:19.877
Look, would you be willing to
introduce me to this Miss Livingston?

17:20.573 --> 17:23.771
- It just happens...
- You don't have to explain, that's my business,

17:23.807 --> 17:25.916
good will and public relations.

17:25.952 --> 17:28.908
See, I'm the press agent
for this jungle paradise.

17:28.943 --> 17:31.493
Oh, well, I... I'd appreciate it very much.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.772
- Just as soon as soon as she comes out.
- Uh-huh.

17:34.387 --> 17:40.974
I've... uh... it happens I've had a...
an experience.

17:41.528 --> 17:47.162
It's a rather... uh... curious thing...
as a matter of fact... uh...

17:50.214 --> 17:53.822
- Been married some time I see, huh?
- Huh?

17:54.604 --> 17:58.469
Oh, yes, nearly 15 years.

18:00.001 --> 18:01.802
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ
which is Greek to me.

18:02.347 --> 18:06.777
- Who is she, you know?
- Not from this angle.

18:09.337 --> 18:11.766
Rather a neat little number, though.

18:12.719 --> 18:16.099
Not that I pay a good deal of
attention to that sort of thing anymore.

18:17.295 --> 18:20.345
Well, if we're going to start
lying to each other, why...

18:26.892 --> 18:30.106
Here comes Miss Barracuda now.
C'mon.

18:41.544 --> 18:44.926
- Hey! You know that girl?
- Yeah.

18:45.027 --> 18:47.910
- That's not a girl, that's my wife.
- No kid!

18:48.011 --> 18:51.189
Holy smokes, I never saw her in
a suit like that before in my life.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.107
How are you, Fitz, Darling?

18:54.142 --> 18:55.972
Miss Livingston, Mr. Peabody.

18:56.007 --> 18:57.934
- How do you do, Miss Livingston.
- How are you?

18:57.969 --> 19:02.719
Mr. Peabody's an American freak,
he's just been leering at his own wife.

19:03.723 --> 19:07.143
How charming, you must
be a dream of a husband.

19:07.778 --> 19:10.316
I am, but who's that with her?

19:12.047 --> 19:15.859
- Who's got a cigarette?
- Oh, here you are.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.897
Thanks! That's Major Robert Hadley.

19:29.405 --> 19:33.906
- He's on the Governor General's staff.
- Well, shall we join him?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.686
Do you wish to very much?

19:41.273 --> 19:44.726
- My word! What a gruesome looking fellow.
- That's my husband.

19:44.761 --> 19:46.431
Yes, I know.

19:46.566 --> 19:49.550
But you DO sing, don't you?

19:49.585 --> 19:52.322
Yes, but I can't sing
without accompaniment.

20:01.918 --> 20:05.294
Listen, do you know that?

20:17.406 --> 20:25.101
♫ The Caribbees, the Caribbees ♫

20:25.506 --> 20:32.120
♫ When nothing goes by
but clouds in the sky above. ♫

20:34.121 --> 20:37.938
♫ The tiny key, ♫

20:37.939 --> 20:41.756
♫ the roaring sea. ♫

20:42.157 --> 20:49.706
♫ Their soft serenade just
seems to be made for love. ♫

20:50.439 --> 20:58.439
♫ I dream how heavenly
the night would be ♫

20:58.775 --> 21:04.259
♫ with you with me within your arms. ♫

21:04.594 --> 21:07.480
- How old is he really?
- Forty-six.

21:07.514 --> 21:15.282
♫ The rains disguise the full moon's rise ♫

21:15.517 --> 21:23.278
♫ come under a net of
sleepy palmetto trees. ♫

21:24.135 --> 21:32.124
♫ This dream come true, if only you ♫

21:32.223 --> 21:40.223
♫ and the islands they
call the Caribbees. ♫

21:59.166 --> 22:01.285
The circumstances were
entirely different.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.091
Polly had made a public
spectacle of herself.

22:04.426 --> 22:06.659
And in that suit! Holy Moses!

22:07.394 --> 22:11.506
I was simply making a few
serious inquiries into a matter.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.718
It was gone.

22:31.968 --> 22:33.397
I gave up.

22:37.248 --> 22:40.522
As a matter of fact,
Polly was never wronger in her life.

22:41.181 --> 22:45.841
I don't go for those all-around women like
Cathy Livingston, they make me nervous.

22:46.076 --> 22:49.414
What I like is a woman who
can't do anything very much...

23:22.515 --> 23:25.344
You take one of those
Esquire Magazine Englishmen

23:25.345 --> 23:27.833
with that little moustache
and that accent,

23:27.868 --> 23:30.608
it's murder what they do to married women.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.639
Polly's got a darned
good head on her shoulders.

23:38.640 --> 23:43.010
But along comes one of those
Old School Tie boys and...

24:08.854 --> 24:11.706
Not that I haven't got
complete faith in Polly.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.908
Oh, Brother!

25:03.016 --> 25:05.927
Who'd've known about that...
hooked her tail.

26:45.928 --> 26:48.356
Holy Jumping Moses

27:07.610 --> 27:09.209
Polly!

27:13.425 --> 27:14.951
Polly!

27:18.007 --> 27:19.600
Polly!

27:21.761 --> 27:23.539
Polly!

27:24.533 --> 27:25.945
Oh! Darn it!

27:27.179 --> 27:28.945
Take it easy, Miss, will you?

27:29.818 --> 27:30.731
Where's Mrs. Peabody?

27:30.866 --> 27:33.739
Madam's gone to town, Sir,
she'll be right back, though.

27:34.912 --> 27:37.532
You don't generally take
fish upstairs, Sir.

27:42.313 --> 27:44.210
Just... just take it easy, my Dear.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.622
There we are... there.

27:50.065 --> 27:53.355
Nobody's gonna hurt you, nobody's gon...

27:53.560 --> 27:54.567
Oh!

27:58.886 --> 28:00.079
Yes.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.388
Up, up, all right, come on dear.

28:43.926 --> 28:47.209
Now... here we go... there we go.

28:48.551 --> 28:53.696
That's it, now you just trust your Uncle
Arthur and everything will be ALL right.

29:01.117 --> 29:03.117
Just a moment.

29:04.818 --> 29:06.264
Now...

29:09.766 --> 29:10.984
Oh, yes.

29:11.219 --> 29:13.482
Well, all right now, just...
just open your mouth.

29:14.224 --> 29:16.077
C'mon now, it... it'll do you good.

29:16.078 --> 29:19.004
Just... just open up...
like that.

29:19.005 --> 29:21.019
Yeah, go on, that... that's a good girl.

29:21.054 --> 29:23.358
That's what we call...

29:56.633 --> 29:58.719
Mr. Peabody back yet?

29:58.854 --> 30:01.825
Yes, Madam, he's waiting
for you in the living room.

30:01.860 --> 30:05.683
Oh, well, I'm going to take
a bath first if he asks.

30:10.554 --> 30:16.026
- What's the matter? Is something wrong?
- No, Madam, there's nothing wrong.

30:51.231 --> 30:53.170
What ails you, you silly animal?

31:04.449 --> 31:05.755
Who's that?

31:16.746 --> 31:20.291
- Arthur!
- Polly.

31:20.326 --> 31:22.836
Would you mind telling me
who that woman is in my bathroom?

31:22.871 --> 31:27.399
- Woman? Oh, oh, oh, that's no woman.
- Well, it must be a pretty fancy fellow.

31:27.434 --> 31:29.412
The place reeks of my
best Forbidden Madness.

31:29.747 --> 31:31.666
- Oh, but that's impossible.
- Why is it?

31:31.667 --> 31:36.586
Because, a... a piscatorial phenomenon simply
wouldn't use Forbidden Madness, that's why.

31:36.721 --> 31:39.835
- Are you tight?
- Not at all.

31:40.712 --> 31:43.582
I have had a rather odd experience.

31:43.617 --> 31:45.920
You must be! Who is that up there?

31:45.955 --> 31:53.361
My Dear, that happens to be
nothing less than a mermaid.

31:54.896 --> 31:58.705
An authentic, flesh and blood mermaid.

31:58.748 --> 32:02.897
Have you got that... that Livingston woman
up there taking a bath in my tub?

32:02.932 --> 32:06.406
No, of course not, why should I give
Cathy Livingston a bath?

32:06.441 --> 32:09.152
- You better come upstairs with me for a moment.
- Oh, but you better listen first.

32:09.187 --> 32:11.710
Let's go up first, we may
have more to talk about then.

32:12.089 --> 32:13.194
Polly.

32:14.904 --> 32:16.244
Polly.

32:16.513 --> 32:17.735
Polly.

32:18.445 --> 32:20.665
Now, Polly, this is a
situation that calls for

32:20.666 --> 32:22.837
a couple of words of
explanation, believe me.

32:26.282 --> 32:28.306
Now, will you speak to
your friend or shall I?

32:28.641 --> 32:31.363
- It's no use, she can't talk.
- No?

32:34.230 --> 32:35.798
Hello!

32:36.431 --> 32:40.157
- Will you come out, or should I come in?
- She can't walk, either.

32:40.260 --> 32:43.595
- Drunk?
- No legs.

32:44.974 --> 32:48.391
- I'm coming in.
- Tally-ho.

32:58.939 --> 33:01.518
- You're not tight.
- I told you.

33:01.553 --> 33:03.361
You're plastered!

33:03.496 --> 33:08.375
Well, as a matter of fact, I'm NOT, but I'm
GOING to be, I can promise you that.

33:08.410 --> 33:12.284
Just get that FISH out of my TUB
and get it out at once.

33:33.095 --> 33:36.136
Son of a gun, how do you like that?

33:45.444 --> 33:49.059
All right, Honey, party's over.

33:49.146 --> 33:51.514
Now... here.

33:53.847 --> 33:55.149
Upsy-daisy.

33:55.184 --> 33:58.316
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we won't be able
to make it for dinner tonight,

33:58.351 --> 34:01.828
something just came up and I don't
think Arthur's going to feel like it.

34:03.357 --> 34:09.404
- Lunch? When?
- What's the matter with tomorrow? Just you and I.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.143
You mean alone?
Just a minute.

34:12.344 --> 34:13.538
Arthur!

34:13.873 --> 34:16.518
May I have your further
wishes in the matter?

34:16.554 --> 34:18.694
Just get rid of it, that's all.
Give it to the cook,

34:18.695 --> 34:20.632
maybe she can get a steak
out of it for dinner.

34:21.563 --> 34:23.735
I'm not exactly a cannibal, you know?

34:23.770 --> 34:26.440
Oh, Arthur, stop that,
just get rid of it.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.312
Throw it back in the ocean.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.972
What time?

34:38.678 --> 34:41.871
I'm sorry my Dear, but I...
I don't know what else to do.

34:43.621 --> 34:47.873
I'd hate to give you up,
but, well, you saw how it was.

34:47.908 --> 34:53.719
And if you don't mind my saying so, my Pet,
you're no guppy, either.

34:56.587 --> 35:00.098
So with your kind permission...

35:04.154 --> 35:08.401
Dear friends, the fish in this aquarium
are rare and valuable.

35:09.227 --> 35:13.047
Enjoy them to your heart's content,
but do not, please,

35:13.082 --> 35:15.070
feed or annoy them.

35:22.485 --> 35:26.230
The decision made at this point,
was, I see now, a mistake.

35:26.876 --> 35:29.850
The truth is that no
decision involving mermaids

35:29.951 --> 35:33.425
should ever be made with even a
suggestion of alcohol under the belt.

35:34.998 --> 35:39.058
You don't want to go back
in that ocean, do you? No.

35:39.163 --> 35:43.326
It's SO big, and you're so pretty.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.594
What's your name?

35:51.021 --> 35:53.820
It must be something lovely, like...

35:56.323 --> 36:00.807
Lenore. Lenore.

36:11.557 --> 36:13.805
That's what we call a kiss.

36:18.848 --> 36:21.791
It's a nice idea, what do you think?

36:22.701 --> 36:28.742
And... and so simple, you know,
all you have to do, actually, is...

36:43.010 --> 36:46.713
It's a symbol, it's the way of saying...

36:47.681 --> 36:53.869
I think you're very pretty,
and I like you very much.

36:59.436 --> 37:05.768
Do you understand at all? No?
Well, you just wait, Lenore,

37:06.294 --> 37:11.538
it may take a little time,
but sooner or later you'll get the idea.

37:26.376 --> 37:28.070
Holy Moses!

37:55.170 --> 37:57.734
Thank you so much,
do come in again.

38:01.771 --> 38:05.962
- Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, I'd like to look at some sweaters, please.

38:05.963 --> 38:10.959
- Certainly, Sir, about what size?
- Oh... small.

38:10.994 --> 38:17.337
Six? Eight? Ten?
Twelve? Fourteen? Sixteen?

38:17.372 --> 38:21.011
- A six, I imagine.
- Long sleeves or short?

38:21.846 --> 38:24.064
- Short.
- Slip-on or Cardigan?

38:26.053 --> 38:28.407
- Slip-on.
- Turtle-neck or crew?

38:30.250 --> 38:32.077
- Crew.
- Thank you.

38:33.674 --> 38:35.218
Here we are.

38:37.488 --> 38:42.492
- Oh! But... but that's a child's, isn't it?
- You said six, I believe, Sir.

38:42.527 --> 38:46.023
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't quite
understand, it... it...

38:46.024 --> 38:48.937
it's for an adult, but
a rather small adult.

38:48.972 --> 38:53.815
Thirty-two? Thirty-four?
Thirty-six? Thirty-eight?

38:53.850 --> 38:58.611
- Forty?
- Well, let's... let's try thirty-two.

38:58.646 --> 38:59.759
Quite!

39:03.085 --> 39:04.169
Here we are.

39:06.489 --> 39:09.223
Light as a whisper. Gay as a sunbeam.

39:09.335 --> 39:14.180
Wearing it will be an emotional adventure
spangled with the moon glow of twilight.

39:14.415 --> 39:18.993
- Really?
- It also comes in a gay spectrum of springtime hues.

39:19.028 --> 39:25.081
Pistachio, Purple Almond, Banana,
Marshmallow, Peach Dream, and Licorice.

39:25.316 --> 39:28.472
- Licorice?
- It's sort of a light black.

39:30.804 --> 39:34.299
- Would you be good enough to tell me something?
- Enchanted.

39:34.767 --> 39:40.117
- Whatever became of blue?
- Would you care for it... or not?

39:42.381 --> 39:45.675
Yes, yes, I suppose so...
there's something,

39:45.676 --> 39:49.115
well, there's... there's
just one other thing.

39:49.150 --> 39:51.405
- Yes?
- Can you swim in it?

39:51.440 --> 39:54.295
Yeah, I know it's a rather
an odd question, but

39:54.296 --> 39:57.209
in this case it's... it's
necessary, I'm afraid.

39:57.444 --> 40:03.463
One COULD, I fancy, if one
had no objection to shrinking.

40:06.264 --> 40:08.371
Oh, yes, of course.

40:08.606 --> 40:11.906
May I ask, is the young
lady's prejudice against

40:11.907 --> 40:14.802
swimming in a swim suit
quite deep seated?

40:16.377 --> 40:20.699
No, no, not at all.
That's an excellent idea!

40:21.134 --> 40:25.149
- I'll have HALF a bathing suit.
- Half a bathing suit?

40:25.150 --> 40:27.571
That's it! The top half
of a two piece suit.

40:27.572 --> 40:32.213
Oh, but I'm very sorry, Sir, but I'm afraid
we're not permitted to split our suits.

40:32.214 --> 40:39.451
Oh, I... I'd pay for the whole thing, I mean that...
I... that I'd... I'd have no need...

40:40.802 --> 40:44.262
Rather... she'd have no need...

40:46.257 --> 40:47.008
I mean that...

40:47.412 --> 40:49.697
Well, well, you, you
could keep the rest of it.

40:50.002 --> 40:51.448
Oh, I see.

40:54.692 --> 40:58.469
- Oh, hello.
- Did I hear right? Half a bathing suit?

40:58.504 --> 40:59.970
If you'll pardon me.

41:05.643 --> 41:09.156
- Well, as a matter of fact...
- No, no, no! Don't tell me, I don't want to hear.

41:09.191 --> 41:12.040
I THINK I'd just rather wonder about it.

41:13.066 --> 41:17.800
Why, it's... it's quite simple,
I mean the truth is...

41:21.205 --> 41:27.325
I see... I'm beginning to suspect there
are hidden depths in you, Mr. Peabody.

41:29.052 --> 41:32.207
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Nothing like that.

41:32.242 --> 41:35.254
I mean the... look, the simple fact is...

41:37.335 --> 41:40.921
I know... you're shopping for that fish.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.644
- Who told you?
- Several people.

41:47.689 --> 41:49.088
Voilà!

41:51.054 --> 41:54.661
The Halter-Neck, toast of
fashionable Hollywood society.

41:56.148 --> 42:00.158
The diaper model.
Not un-provocative, n'est-ce pas?

42:01.453 --> 42:05.566
The Handkerchief Ensemble, blithe
as a breeze, vital as youth,

42:05.720 --> 42:11.185
pretty as a picture, cool as a cucumber,
slick as a whistle, smart as a tack...

42:26.116 --> 42:30.609
Darling, I don't want to offend you, but...

42:31.333 --> 42:33.826
you know, you're really
not dressed for company,

42:33.827 --> 42:36.167
and we're bound to have
some sooner or later.

42:36.202 --> 42:41.064
Now, these... these little articles,
are... are what we call "modesty".

42:41.399 --> 42:48.847
Now, modesty means... well... if you
haven't got it, some people are shocked,

42:48.882 --> 42:53.286
some are embarrassed and some,
I regret say, are quite pleased.

42:53.445 --> 42:59.304
Now, you see, in... in your case,
well, you get the idea don't you?

43:01.234 --> 43:04.512
Oh, oh, oh, no, look, Darling, here...

43:07.932 --> 43:11.782
Ya see, the idea is... that...

43:12.117 --> 43:14.011
Now, Darling, please.

43:15.010 --> 43:18.760
No, no, no, not yet, look, I...
I've got to get you

43:18.761 --> 43:22.437
straightened-out on one or
two other points first.

43:22.874 --> 43:26.762
For instance, you've got to
stop eating the fish in the pond.

43:27.097 --> 43:31.480
Do you realize that's about a thousand dollars
worth of rare fish you've put away today?

43:32.172 --> 43:36.635
Look, if you like fish so much,
why don't you dig into some of that?

43:39.639 --> 43:46.572
Oh, now, Darling, I... look, I... I didn't...
I didn't mean to hurt you, really I didn't.

43:48.027 --> 43:51.433
No... now...

43:52.974 --> 43:54.679
You DO love me, don't you?

43:59.862 --> 44:04.134
Take it easy, Dear, you don't
want to break my neck, do you?

44:04.952 --> 44:07.998
No, of course not, so... so you've...
you've got to

44:07.999 --> 44:11.278
learn the difference between
a hug and a... a strangle.

44:11.313 --> 44:17.701
You understand?
Well, all right now, but... easy this time.

44:31.178 --> 44:32.963
Now, isn't that nicer?

44:34.491 --> 44:37.060
My age means nothing to you, does it?

44:37.995 --> 44:42.388
You don't think that 50
is so conclusive, do you?

44:43.007 --> 44:45.309
No, of course not, why should you?

44:45.981 --> 44:49.077
What's so dreadful, really,
about a few gray hairs?

44:49.643 --> 44:52.388
Well, suppose a man doesn't
care to make a public

44:52.389 --> 44:54.748
spectacle of himself
by running up stairs.

44:54.983 --> 44:57.856
Is that such an accomplishment,
running running up stairs like a fool?

44:58.641 --> 45:01.118
Suppose he DOES get a
little sleepy in night clubs.

45:07.061 --> 45:12.020
The truth of the matter is that a man
at 50 is at the very peak of his faculties.

45:12.504 --> 45:14.211
Why, any doctor'll tell you that.

45:14.446 --> 45:20.014
You know, at 50... oh, no, no,
don't go, Darling, don't go, not yet.

45:20.349 --> 45:28.349
Because, at 50, a man has developed
understanding, sympathy, tenderness.

45:30.024 --> 45:34.565
As no younger man could,
he appreciates beauty like yours.

45:36.283 --> 45:42.128
In your eyes is a beauty richer
than any human eye could hold.

45:42.720 --> 45:47.491
The beauty of eternal wisdom,
and it's the beauty of a child, too.

45:48.063 --> 45:52.147
Simple, direct, uncomplicated,

45:52.182 --> 45:54.182
like your love for me.

45:55.156 --> 45:59.285
With such a love, what man
could be anything but younger...

46:05.698 --> 46:06.980
Wait!

46:07.615 --> 46:12.739
No, I'll come back some other time...
when you're all right.

46:26.046 --> 46:27.818
Wait!

46:35.560 --> 46:39.116
- Aren't you glad I'm here?
- Oh, you can bet your life.

46:39.967 --> 46:41.675
They're talking about you.

46:42.504 --> 46:45.178
- Who?
- "They" Does that bother you?

46:45.213 --> 46:49.479
Oh, no, no, on the contrary,
I'm flattered.

46:49.514 --> 46:52.196
Although, I must say,
you don't give them much to go on.

46:53.001 --> 46:58.280
A sly fellow, huh? I'm not sure that you'll
be able to see anything this late,

46:58.717 --> 47:03.597
she's... she's not much on late hours,
the minute the sun goes down she's...

47:03.632 --> 47:08.641
It doesn't matter, I've seen fish before.
Right now it's YOU I'm interested in.

47:14.054 --> 47:16.634
Come on! What are you trying
to get away with really?

47:18.519 --> 47:21.941
- I don't know, I...
- Oh, come now! Who is she?

47:23.935 --> 47:26.938
- Is she pretty?
- Oh, very.

47:26.973 --> 47:29.836
Oh... pretty as me?

47:32.073 --> 47:35.896
A mystery is good for a man,
it makes him doubly attractive.

47:35.931 --> 47:39.019
It makes a woman want to find out more.

47:42.154 --> 47:45.521
- Did you see it?
- Polly, Darling I didn't know you were home.

47:45.656 --> 47:48.377
Aren't you going to bring-out
your little friend for Mrs. Livingston?

47:49.548 --> 47:53.996
- MISS Livingston, Darling.
- Oh, yes, of course, so sorry.

47:55.266 --> 47:58.789
They all seem to be hiding, I don't
even see any of the little goldfish.

47:59.024 --> 48:01.625
You're NOT having a bit of
FUN with me, are you?

48:02.060 --> 48:03.960
I'm not, at any rate.

48:04.095 --> 48:09.462
Well, I'm quite an angler myself you know,
and I'd like VERY much to see it.

48:10.531 --> 48:14.657
- Arthur, be an angel and get me that drink.
- Oh, absolutely.

48:16.882 --> 48:20.342
Well, so long as it's not a barracuda.

48:21.832 --> 48:23.491
Miss Livingston!

48:24.885 --> 48:26.104
Miss Livingston!

48:28.971 --> 48:32.517
That woman's either drunk or crazy,
she's in the pond.

48:32.552 --> 48:34.752
Go upstairs and get her a towel and a robe.

49:42.356 --> 49:44.039
Nice people you pick up.

49:49.681 --> 49:52.306
- You stay here.
- Huh?

50:01.148 --> 50:02.662
But, what happened?

50:02.997 --> 50:04.332
Bring that drink!

50:11.963 --> 50:13.430
Here.

50:14.431 --> 50:16.898
Something seems to have
chased her, for a change.

50:18.965 --> 50:21.381
It was like a hideous nightmare,

50:21.620 --> 50:27.061
something with arms, like an
octopus, pulling me down and down.

50:27.096 --> 50:29.477
Now, now, now, now, now,
you're... you're all right now.

50:29.512 --> 50:30.857
And then it bit me.

50:30.892 --> 50:33.398
- Bit you?
- In the leg.

50:35.779 --> 50:38.062
Why, it looks like a human bite.

50:38.597 --> 50:42.480
Well, are you... are you sure
you didn't bite yourself?

50:45.871 --> 50:51.057
Well, I'll go now, I'm terribly
sorry about all this.

50:51.092 --> 50:54.228
So stupid of me.
I'll get my dress.

50:54.632 --> 50:58.782
- May I...
- No, thank you, I'll slip into it out there.

50:59.017 --> 51:00.708
I'll be back in a minute.

51:17.035 --> 51:18.798
Just a peach, isn't she?

51:19.726 --> 51:24.036
Well, what does it matter... at my age.

51:27.201 --> 51:28.449
Did you bring it in?

51:29.441 --> 51:31.258
No, it was on the Rattan
chair, right where you threw it.

51:31.292 --> 51:33.141
Well, it's not there
now, I've looked all over.

51:33.576 --> 51:36.335
Oh, it must be, it couldn't've walked away.

51:37.322 --> 51:39.523
Could you have left it in
the pond when you climbed-out?

51:39.620 --> 51:41.917
No, I GOT out at the other end.

51:49.152 --> 51:51.919
- It's not here.
- THAT'S funny.

51:51.954 --> 51:56.360
Well, don't bother about it anymore,
I've been too much of a nuisance, as it is.

51:56.930 --> 52:00.115
If you don't need this robe
tonight it'll do to drive home in.

52:00.149 --> 52:00.824
Good night.

52:00.859 --> 52:02.319
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:07.646 --> 52:09.998
Now, if you'll be good enough
to listen for a moment...

52:34.502 --> 52:36.843
Cliff! Shut up!

52:38.078 --> 52:40.537
Come down there and kick your teeth in.

52:45.497 --> 52:49.013
If I believed for a minute
that a man's best friend's

52:49.014 --> 52:52.269
his dog, I'd cut my throat
without further delay.

52:52.270 --> 52:54.666
- Arthur.
- Huh?

52:54.767 --> 52:56.231
Sit here, Dear.

53:06.077 --> 53:08.893
If that woman really matters to you...

53:10.619 --> 53:12.348
Listen, Polly...

53:12.383 --> 53:15.496
I could understand a little
flirtation with her...

53:15.497 --> 53:18.609
I know that men, well, go
a little peculiar at 50.

53:19.661 --> 53:22.665
But when I saw that look
of horror on your face

53:22.666 --> 53:25.606
tonight, over that little
bite, I was shocked.

53:25.641 --> 53:29.023
For the first time, I realized
how deeply you must feel.

53:29.058 --> 53:35.628
Polly, will you listen a minute... I've
seen the woman three times in my life.

53:35.917 --> 53:40.575
At the beach party the other night,
on the street this afternoon, and tonight.

53:40.810 --> 53:45.636
Now, is it your understanding that that
constitutes a historic love affair?

53:45.671 --> 53:46.749
But that look.

53:46.784 --> 53:50.144
Polly, that look would have been
the same if it had been anybody else.

53:50.479 --> 53:55.757
Lady Potts, Lord Potts, King Potts,
Major Ronald Hadley himself.

53:56.245 --> 54:00.468
As a reasonably humane host, I
probably always shall be more or less

54:00.503 --> 54:04.273
disturbed by the spectacle of a
guest being chewed-up underwater.

54:04.773 --> 54:06.325
So that's it.

54:07.573 --> 54:10.531
- What?
- Ronald Hadley.

54:12.658 --> 54:17.365
- I picked the name out of the air.
- There's been some gossip, I suppose.

54:18.300 --> 54:19.931
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:21.637 --> 54:23.609
I've had lunch with him a couple of times.

54:23.941 --> 54:27.647
- Well, is there any reason you shouldn't have.
- No, no, but...

54:29.325 --> 54:31.457
I think I see it all now.

54:32.175 --> 54:34.676
Well, if you see me tangled-up
with Cathy Livingston,

54:34.677 --> 54:36.992
I wish you'd be good enough
to take another look.

54:37.227 --> 54:40.611
Perhaps... perhaps we've
both been a bit to blame.

54:41.518 --> 54:42.667
I'm not.

54:42.769 --> 54:45.619
Perhaps we've both forgotten
ourselves for a moment.

54:45.649 --> 54:47.043
Not me.

54:47.078 --> 54:50.321
So, now there's only one
thing left for us to do:

54:50.356 --> 54:53.886
Pull ourselves together and
remember who and what we are.

54:53.921 --> 54:56.795
There's nothing for me to pull-together
because I've never been apart.

54:57.349 --> 55:00.781
Arthur, if i promise
never to see or speak to

55:00.782 --> 55:04.511
Ronald Hadley again, will
you give-up this woman?

55:04.898 --> 55:09.665
Give her up?! Polly, How can you
give-up a woman you've only said hello to?

55:09.700 --> 55:12.693
Please, Arthur, this is serious.
Won't you?

55:13.601 --> 55:18.367
- Polly, I told you...
- I'll never so much as look at him again.

55:18.402 --> 55:22.376
If he speaks, I won't answer.
If he comes in the room, I'll leave.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.211
If only you'll do as much for me.

55:31.599 --> 55:35.072
- All right.
- Will you really, Darling?

55:35.407 --> 55:41.578
- Yes, I will.
- Do you... do you think you'll be able to?

55:42.785 --> 55:46.899
I believe so, I.. I can only
try, of course, but with

55:46.900 --> 55:50.785
your strength and faith and
help, I believe I can.

55:52.184 --> 55:55.248
Oh, Darling, Darling.

56:31.816 --> 56:36.440
Darling, you shouldn't, four o'clock
in the morning is no hour for singing.

56:36.975 --> 56:40.000
People'll think you're drunk...
or that I am.

56:46.654 --> 56:51.270
Ah! You look beautiful,
perfectly beautiful.

56:55.349 --> 56:59.882
You know, it's... it's much more becoming
on you, that it was on Cathy Livingston?

57:01.324 --> 57:04.839
Now wait. I've had just
about as much of that as

57:04.840 --> 57:08.139
I can stand in one night,
so don't YOU start.

57:09.460 --> 57:13.607
As a matter of fact, I don't know when I've
ever gotten so sick of a woman so quickly.

57:26.760 --> 57:30.431
All I want now is just
a little peace and quiet.

57:35.693 --> 57:40.520
There's only one way out it that I can see:
Polly's GOT to meet you.

57:40.655 --> 57:45.971
Polly, Darling, this is Lenore, the young
mermaid I was telling you about, remember?

57:46.592 --> 57:49.625
She lives in a little castle
at the bottom of the fish pond.

57:49.660 --> 57:54.752
"Quite pleasant!", she says, "But a
trifle damp, like California, I imagine."

57:56.413 --> 57:58.062
What the matter, Darling?

57:59.224 --> 58:01.982
Oh, no, no, stop it, Lee, stop it,

58:02.017 --> 58:03.727
I want you to meet her.

58:24.844 --> 58:30.887
"The sins that you do by two and two,
you must pay for one and one."

58:42.093 --> 58:45.570
Polly, let me In.

58:47.186 --> 58:51.872
Polly! Come on now, let me in and let's
get this thing straightened-out.

58:52.858 --> 58:56.051
Do you hear me? Polly!

58:57.509 --> 59:01.275
Oh, come on, now, just
give me just one min...

59:01.276 --> 59:05.136
rather, give me... give me ten minutes
and I can explain the whole business.

59:25.730 --> 59:28.746
Alcoholics Anonymous, here I come.

59:34.483 --> 59:36.273
Now, Polly...

59:36.462 --> 59:40.772
Now, now, Polly, Polly, now, Polly,
where do you think you're going?

59:40.807 --> 59:42.734
Will you be good enough
to stand aside, please.

59:42.769 --> 59:47.297
Polly, don't be ridiculous, if you'll listen
to me for ten, for fifteen minutes...

59:47.821 --> 59:50.451
Did you hear me ask you
to stand-away from that door?

59:50.486 --> 59:53.270
Polly, be reasonable, where will
you go at this hour of the night?

59:53.721 --> 59:58.522
- Now, come on back upstairs.
- Don't you DARE touch me, you barefaced liar!

59:58.808 --> 01:00:00.931
What do you mean?
What have I lied to you about?

01:00:00.966 --> 01:00:03.960
Not one hour after swearing,
in my arms,

01:00:04.195 --> 01:00:06.873
knowing all the time she was
down there waiting for you.

01:00:07.362 --> 01:00:10.008
Holy Moses, are you on that...

01:00:11.221 --> 01:00:13.838
Bound to slip.
Polly! Listen.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:19.280
Now, Polly, Polly, now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, you're... Polly!

01:00:19.915 --> 01:00:22.878
You're simply making a
molehill out of nothing.

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:26.601
- That wasn't Cathy Livingston out there.
- No? Then, who pray, was it?

01:00:26.636 --> 01:00:29.442
It was... it... nobody,
that's exactly what I'm

01:00:29.443 --> 01:00:32.132
trying to tell you, it
wasn't a woman at all.

01:00:32.767 --> 01:00:36.662
Now, Polly... Polly, now, wait...
that was the mermaid.

01:00:36.897 --> 01:00:39.897
- That... that fish?
- Partly fish, yes.

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:42.911
Oh! A fish wearing a
gold Lamé evening dress?

01:00:43.964 --> 01:00:47.580
I know it sounds peculiar, but...
but that's precisely what it was.

01:00:48.004 --> 01:00:52.459
That fish, as you call her, pinched
Cathy's dress and she was trying it on.

01:00:52.594 --> 01:00:56.376
Like a kid! It was the first time
in her life she'd ever had clothes on.

01:00:56.875 --> 01:01:03.082
And we were just sitting there talking
about this and I was telling her... that...

01:01:03.517 --> 01:01:09.413
- Go on.
- Well, I know it sounds peculiar...

01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:12.123
And what was Miss Mermaid
WEARING when you left her?

01:01:12.158 --> 01:01:17.985
What was he wearing?
Oh, oh, no.

01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:25.637
Now! Now! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Cathy! Cathy! Polly, I mean.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.494
Polly!

01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:47.212
♫ Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you, ♫

01:01:48.057 --> 01:01:56.057
♫ Happy birthday, Dear Arthur,
you're fifty today. ♫

01:01:58.724 --> 01:02:03.257
♫ Congratulations. ♫

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.530
- Now, you're a friend of Peabody's, aren't you?
- Somewhat.

01:02:25.565 --> 01:02:26.598
How's that?

01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:29.783
"Somewhat", it's... it's an American
vulgarism meaning "yes".

01:02:29.818 --> 01:02:33.061
- Can't he speak English?
- Quite!

01:02:33.396 --> 01:02:35.848
That's it... much better.

01:02:35.883 --> 01:02:39.855
Well, the car's been identified as
Mrs. Peabody's, all very well and good...

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:43.449
except it now turns out that nobody's seen
Mrs. Peabody for at least a week.

01:02:43.484 --> 01:02:45.906
'af a fortni't, egad.

01:02:45.927 --> 01:02:48.390
You know, on second thought, old man,

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:52.617
I think I find you even more revolting
as an Englishman than I do as an American.

01:02:52.752 --> 01:02:56.244
So, would you be good enough to revert
to your more normal loathsomeness?

01:02:56.245 --> 01:02:57.773
Well, I...

01:03:04.164 --> 01:03:07.184
- To resume...
- You only do that because you know it hurts me.

01:03:07.908 --> 01:03:12.384
- Peabody himself is still at the Villa.
- Fellow won't answer his telephone.

01:03:12.419 --> 01:03:14.576
- If I'd gone to Oxford,
you wouldn't do it.

01:03:14.577 --> 01:03:17.117
- Won't answer the telephone,
won't answer the door.

01:03:17.152 --> 01:03:20.825
No deliveries and no sign whatever
of Mrs. Peabody anywhere.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.965
If I were the queen, you'd swallow
that thing, fire and all.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.545
She's not staying at either of the hotels,
nor has left the Island by boat or plane.

01:03:28.936 --> 01:03:32.227
Why should the fellow have a telephone
if he's not going to answer it?

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:37.038
In other words, it is all very peculiar,
even for an American couple.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.205
And while there may be a perfectly
simple explanation for the whole affair,

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.063
I, for one, shouldn't be at all surprised
if the wretched woman were dead somewhere,

01:03:45.098 --> 01:03:47.649
murdered, of course,
by that odious husband of hers.

01:03:47.684 --> 01:03:48.928
He wouldn't like you either.

01:03:49.163 --> 01:03:51.767
So, His Excellency suggests
that you make an unofficial

01:03:51.768 --> 01:03:54.464
call first on the blighter and
see what you can find out,

01:03:54.465 --> 01:03:56.931
before we turn the case over to the Police.

01:03:57.249 --> 01:03:59.705
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you, right away.

01:04:02.604 --> 01:04:04.397
Very well.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:14.929
But, don't be surprised if this
leads to another Bunker Hill.

01:04:17.484 --> 01:04:21.187
Might as well rip the ruddy thing out
if he isn't going to answer it.

01:04:24.122 --> 01:04:26.692
The servants had all departed,
even before Polly.

01:04:27.537 --> 01:04:29.863
But after the first
shock and distress,

01:04:30.094 --> 01:04:33.850
I must say the situation was
not without its pleasanter aspects.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:37.978
There's much to be said for a woman,
even an imperfect one...

01:04:38.154 --> 01:04:42.228
who lives, breathes and exists
only for the man she loves.

01:05:15.419 --> 01:05:18.166
You don't seem to have as many
goldfish as you used to.

01:05:18.201 --> 01:05:23.773
- How did you get in here?
- Over the wall... I used to be a cat burglar.

01:05:24.523 --> 01:05:29.141
Oh, well, you... would you join me
in a cup of coffee?

01:05:29.414 --> 01:05:32.207
- No thanks.
- Anything else? Highball?

01:05:32.442 --> 01:05:35.794
Highball? Huh!
You know that quack I told you about?

01:05:36.472 --> 01:05:39.060
- Yes.
- I went back to him.

01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:41.528
Well, isn't that a little silly
after your last experience?

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:44.697
Naw, I guess so, but you ought
to see that jerk's sister.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:48.394
- So, what happened this time?
- Well, so, this time he figures maybe I'm allergic.

01:05:48.429 --> 01:05:50.971
- To what?
- He don't know, naturally.

01:05:51.006 --> 01:05:53.753
He's got to find out, being
a very thorough fellow,

01:05:53.754 --> 01:05:56.341
he begins at the top of
the list with the "A" s.

01:05:56.376 --> 01:05:59.913
So at five bucks a copy,
he's already inoculated me for...

01:05:59.948 --> 01:06:05.683
alfalfa, alligators, aspirin,
Arabs, apes, Angle Worms,

01:06:05.718 --> 01:06:10.093
anteaters, asparagus,
salted almonds and guess what?

01:06:10.492 --> 01:06:13.072
- What?
- Alcohol.

01:06:14.073 --> 01:06:17.162
Well, what can I do for you?

01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:22.078
Well, they're whispering behind fans these
evenings that you're in something of a jam.

01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:26.904
- Would you like a banana?
- Oh, oh, thanks.

01:06:27.139 --> 01:06:30.669
In fact I hear there's already
a movement afoot to hang you.

01:06:31.646 --> 01:06:35.715
- May I have the cream, please?
- Hum? Oh, sorry.

01:06:36.966 --> 01:06:41.427
- Any particular reason?
- Just murder... Blue Beard stuff.

01:06:44.332 --> 01:06:48.316
- Over a sea cow, one hears.
- Sea cow?

01:06:48.351 --> 01:06:54.373
That's the rumor around Faye's Beauty Shop.
Some kind of a hobgoblin.

01:06:54.818 --> 01:06:56.008
Oh! What the...

01:06:57.062 --> 01:07:00.896
- Oh... I'm terribly sorry.
- What was it?

01:07:05.535 --> 01:07:08.976
It was that creature I caught.
Oh, you cannot see

01:07:08.977 --> 01:07:12.073
her, she hides, she's...
she's rather timid.

01:07:12.108 --> 01:07:15.428
Timid? Gee! That stuff
hit me like a blowtorch!

01:07:26.311 --> 01:07:30.469
If I may ask,
who told you about all this?

01:07:30.504 --> 01:07:32.846
It was in the paper, the Miami paper.

01:07:32.881 --> 01:07:36.507
In Miami they have gossip
columns about fish.

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:43.244
"A charter boat captain out of St. Hilda's
reports a Bostonian, named Peabody,"

01:07:43.279 --> 01:07:47.397
"claims to have hooked a manatee that looks
enough like a human being to be one."

01:07:47.432 --> 01:07:51.020
"Boy, what that square-faced
rum will do to a man."

01:07:52.734 --> 01:07:56.172
- Where is Mrs. Peabody?
- None of your business, of course.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:08:00.464
- Well, it's a cop's idea.
- Cops?

01:08:00.965 --> 01:08:04.923
They found her station wagon on the side
of the Shore Road this morning,

01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:08.013
and if she's not here to receive them
in person this afternoon,

01:08:08.048 --> 01:08:11.527
they're liable to start
digging-up your cellar.

01:08:12.166 --> 01:08:13.266
This is ridiculous.

01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:15.500
All right then, give them
a ridiculous answer.

01:08:15.535 --> 01:08:17.520
I never heard of anything so outrageous.

01:08:18.576 --> 01:08:19.618
Is she here?

01:08:20.153 --> 01:08:24.278
- No, but...
- Look, Arthur, whatever it is, it's okay with me.

01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:27.340
I mean, if it's another
dame you're mixed up with,

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:29.928
just try and remember,
you're talking to a man who

01:08:29.929 --> 01:08:32.479
has been shoved through the
meat grinder backward.

01:08:32.515 --> 01:08:37.301
And you'll find this a
very sympathetic organ.

01:08:37.737 --> 01:08:41.328
Well, it's NOT another woman... exactly.

01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:43.898
All right, a misunderstanding.

01:08:43.933 --> 01:08:47.256
Where lives a man who hasn't
been misunderstood by a woman?

01:08:49.122 --> 01:08:51.158
I wonder if I could trust you?

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:54.277
My dear boy, is this a
time for character study?

01:08:54.312 --> 01:08:58.269
We're two Americans surrounded by
the Redcoats, what choice have you?

01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:05.139
Well, she's not here, I
don't know where she is,

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.013
she left the house, last
night, a week ago...

01:09:09.995 --> 01:09:12.638
after a discussion involving my mermaid.

01:09:12.673 --> 01:09:14.546
Now we're getting some...

01:09:16.595 --> 01:09:19.240
Involving your what?

01:09:25.277 --> 01:09:27.282
I caught a mermaid.

01:09:27.341 --> 01:09:31.447
A charming, sweet,
lovely little mermaid.

01:09:31.682 --> 01:09:36.919
- You mean with a tail?
- I suppose I should have followed Polly,

01:09:37.154 --> 01:09:41.336
or at least gone after her
the next day, but what could I say?

01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:47.304
She was RIGHT, i did love someone else.
Not the girl she thought, not her at all.

01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:52.714
But this enchanting, young creature,
i did and do love.

01:09:54.634 --> 01:09:56.856
Perhaps I better tell you how it happened.

01:10:58.469 --> 01:11:04.832
Well... it's a very unusual story,
I'll say that for it.

01:11:05.718 --> 01:11:07.473
Now, of course, i can't give her up.

01:11:07.908 --> 01:11:11.831
Because even in this short time she's
come to mean so much to me that...

01:11:12.503 --> 01:11:17.406
- Well, it's not an easy thing to explain.
- That I can see.

01:11:19.437 --> 01:11:25.264
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, I... I guess not, but brother, what a story.

01:11:26.354 --> 01:11:29.333
- What do you mean, "A story."?
- When the Mrs. sues.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:33.336
Oh, that's ridiculous, Polly
wouldn't dream of doing such a thing.

01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:37.091
I can see already see the head:
"Wife names fish."

01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:40.639
Why, you're not going to tell them are you?

01:11:41.566 --> 01:11:42.571
What else?

01:11:42.606 --> 01:11:45.391
But I told you that in confidence,
I thought you understood that.

01:11:45.892 --> 01:11:50.280
Isn't it dreadful, you know, when I was
addicted to alcohol and tobacco

01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:54.621
I guess I was just about one of the
nicest guys you'd ever want to meet.

01:11:54.956 --> 01:11:59.829
But ever since I've been taken off
the stuff, I'm just plain, low-down mean.

01:11:59.864 --> 01:12:06.168
A heel from Heeltown, and worse than that,
I just don't seem to care.

01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:09.071
Well, of all the...

01:12:11.458 --> 01:12:12.658
But...

01:12:12.759 --> 01:12:16.371
- Will the police really come?
- Oh, sure, what else have they got to do?

01:12:16.406 --> 01:12:22.272
- And... Lenore?
- Claim her for the crown, I imagine.

01:12:22.307 --> 01:12:25.416
Ship her to London, stick her in a Zoo
and charge admission.

01:12:25.451 --> 01:12:28.469
Ought to do plenty of business
with a good, healthy mermaid.

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:30.365
They'll never get her... never.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.103
Unless, of course, you can
dig up your wife.

01:12:33.438 --> 01:12:37.089
Just a figure of speech, you understand,
no offense intended.

01:12:39.794 --> 01:12:44.886
Darling, Darling, get ready, Honey,
we've got to get out of here, right away.

01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:16.015
- What rot, what pure, utter rot.
- Yes, Master.

01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:20.007
Heard of mermaids, of course,
can't remember ever having seen one though.

01:13:21.008 --> 01:13:24.350
- No sign whatever of Mrs. Peabody?
- No, Master.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.839
Colonel, this is a matter now for Police.

01:13:28.022 --> 01:13:31.521
Get your men down there at once and go
through the whole place from cellar to roof.

01:13:31.556 --> 01:13:35.642
I'll take the Flying Squad,
see if I can find the blighters.

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.863
Drag the pond and scour
every inch of the grounds.

01:13:37.898 --> 01:13:39.620
Better throw a cordon
around the block, too.

01:13:39.655 --> 01:13:41.924
- How's that?
- Don't pay any attention to him.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:46.002
Get going, if there's murder here,
I want to know about it.

01:13:46.037 --> 01:13:47.278
Very good.

01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:55.365
- Charlie.
- Yes, Sir.

01:13:56.893 --> 01:14:00.351
While under the influence
of homogenized milk,

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:05.749
- I've just done a very, very shameful thing.
- I was afraid of that, Sir.

01:14:06.171 --> 01:14:09.297
- I ratted on a fellow creature.
- You didn't, Sir?

01:14:09.332 --> 01:14:13.947
I did. We don't want that
to happen again, do we?

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.665
- No, indeed, Sir.
- No.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.589
So, can you mix a triple martini?

01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:21.108
I believe so, Sir...
in a beer glass.

01:14:21.143 --> 01:14:23.960
- Well, all right, bring me five of 'em.
- Five?

01:14:25.013 --> 01:14:27.661
- Six.
- Yes, Sir.

01:15:22.264 --> 01:15:25.344
- A lovely day.
- Beautiful.

01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:47.233
I can't remember when I've seen exactly
that particular purple light on the sea.

01:15:50.285 --> 01:15:52.557
Please, Darling, please
come on, will you?

01:15:52.592 --> 01:15:54.493
They're coming for
us, don't you understand?

01:15:54.628 --> 01:15:58.479
I mean, you don't want
to be stuck in a zoo in London?

01:16:01.486 --> 01:16:05.117
I'm not playing, believe me, this is no
time for play, I'm... I'm very serious.

01:16:10.795 --> 01:16:16.635
I'm not angry, I'm hurt,
very deeply hurt.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.205
Obviously, you don't trust me.

01:16:22.104 --> 01:16:25.215
Though what I've done to deserve this,
I don't know, I'm sure.

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:32.311
I thought I'd done everything possible to
convince you that... that whatever I did was...

01:16:32.646 --> 01:16:39.925
ultimately, for your own good.
But... apparently you...

01:17:08.344 --> 01:17:09.837
Stone crypts.

01:17:23.566 --> 01:17:25.064
Oh, my Darling.

01:17:30.956 --> 01:17:33.308
Won't answer his phone, neither.

01:17:36.197 --> 01:17:38.470
Now, now, Darling, don't cry.

01:17:39.165 --> 01:17:44.675
I won't let you go, I won't leave you,
never in the world, never when I'm alive.

01:17:46.697 --> 01:17:48.517
Shall we break it down, Sir?

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:53.675
Certainly not! Why, this is a man's home.

01:17:54.047 --> 01:17:57.535
We'll simply have to return
for further instructions.

01:18:32.981 --> 01:18:34.715
I'm all right now.

01:18:38.656 --> 01:18:41.517
Just not used to submarine life.

01:18:44.376 --> 01:18:47.365
Not my element... water, I'm afraid.

01:18:49.522 --> 01:18:52.280
Darling, if...

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.386
- What's that?
- A bunch of silly rocks, isn't it?

01:19:05.421 --> 01:19:06.890
That's Kiura, Sir.

01:19:07.223 --> 01:19:13.037
Kiura, where have I heard about that place.
Come around it.

01:19:16.157 --> 01:19:20.080
It could be worse, I suppose...
not much.

01:19:25.725 --> 01:19:28.830
Wonderful, Darling, exactly what we needed.

01:19:29.514 --> 01:19:32.621
Nothing like keeping a cool head
about you when packing.

01:19:51.145 --> 01:19:53.010
What's all that muck?

01:19:56.484 --> 01:19:58.600
- Picnic.
- All right, all right, drop it.

01:19:58.635 --> 01:20:00.144
The man asked.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.512
Is there any island around
here he could've got to?

01:20:05.298 --> 01:20:08.995
Well, unless he went overboard
he's bound to be somewhere around.

01:20:11.685 --> 01:20:13.962
- All right, all right, put it back.
- Pardon, Sir.

01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:17.191
- The bottle, it's evidence, put it back.
- But who's got any bot...

01:20:19.123 --> 01:20:23.847
As soon as it's dark, I'm going to take the
boat around the Cape to that fishing village.

01:20:24.682 --> 01:20:27.803
I'm going to write a letter to a man I know
who lives down in the Florida Keys.

01:20:28.181 --> 01:20:31.449
As far away from any other
human beings as he can get.

01:20:31.975 --> 01:20:34.345
And I'm going to pay one of
the fishermen to mail it for me.

01:20:35.928 --> 01:20:38.705
If that man will send
me a map and a compass,

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.883
I'm positive we can make
his place in a few days.

01:20:43.847 --> 01:20:46.074
And then we'll find us a place down there.

01:20:46.643 --> 01:20:50.043
There're hundreds of little islands in the
Keys where I can build a shack on the Gulf.

01:20:50.817 --> 01:20:54.875
I mean, just think, away from
the world completely.

01:21:00.077 --> 01:21:05.917
No radio, no newspapers, no silly
news from Washington, no politics,

01:21:06.616 --> 01:21:10.344
no rent trouble, no food shortages.

01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:16.853
Nothing but peace,
quiet, and sunshine... wind...

01:21:20.636 --> 01:21:22.072
Mr. Peabody?

01:21:22.073 --> 01:21:23.509
Lee! Please!

01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:25.248
Are you there, Sir?

01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.259
Yes.

01:21:32.294 --> 01:21:35.374
Will you come up, Sir,
or shall we come down?

01:21:39.283 --> 01:21:41.129
I'll come up.

01:21:52.235 --> 01:21:57.689
- Your wife's back in Boston with the kid.
- Yeah, I imagined she would be.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:02.425
One of those daffy Army guys
flew her back in a bomber.

01:22:04.978 --> 01:22:10.026
- She's a wonder, all right.
- And the...

01:22:23.754 --> 01:22:25.688
He don't feel so good.

01:22:39.225 --> 01:22:43.923
- Do you hear anything... anything odd?
- Like what?

01:22:44.387 --> 01:22:47.980
- I hear it, by Jove.
- Yes, like some kind of singing?

01:22:48.115 --> 01:22:53.902
Of course, it's like something I heard
off Capri once... a good 20 years ago.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.352
It's exactly the same
sort of singing, by Jove.

01:22:58.668 --> 01:23:05.021
- Lenore... Lee... where are you, Lee?
- Easy there! Peabody!

01:23:09.279 --> 01:23:11.084
Bloody quick and come around.

01:23:16.799 --> 01:23:18.481
Please, Lee.

01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:23.547
Lee!

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:24.829
We're coming, Arthur!

01:23:26.296 --> 01:23:27.835
Stick with it, Boy.

01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:32.632
Lee! Where you are, Lee?

01:23:33.099 --> 01:23:34.785
Arthur!

01:23:35.218 --> 01:23:36.280
Lee!

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:38.714
Lee!

01:23:40.385 --> 01:23:41.576
Lee!

01:23:41.905 --> 01:23:44.031
Peeea-body!

01:23:44.632 --> 01:23:45.685
I think I hear him.

01:23:45.686 --> 01:23:46.727
Lee!

01:23:52.386 --> 01:23:55.549
Where are you, Arrrr-thur?

01:24:44.895 --> 01:24:48.089
And Mrs. Peabody questions this story?

01:24:49.244 --> 01:24:52.967
- Don't you?
- What about you, Miss Martin?

01:24:53.301 --> 01:24:57.217
Well... I'm afraid I didn't
all together follow it, Doctor.

01:24:58.514 --> 01:25:02.253
- Who else have you told it to?
- Just Mrs. Peabody.

01:25:02.501 --> 01:25:04.817
Well, let me make a suggestion.

01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:09.519
Don't tell it again to anybody
who hasn't hit that air pocket.

01:25:10.556 --> 01:25:13.334
- What air pocket?
- The 50th birthday, of course.

01:25:13.443 --> 01:25:16.985
Oh, it's all right to talk about it
to an old Purple Heart like me.

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:19.622
But you're wasting your
time trying to explain

01:25:19.623 --> 01:25:22.137
it to children like Mrs. Peabody...
Miss Martin.

01:25:22.495 --> 01:25:26.342
Just wait... let them find
it out for themselves.

01:25:26.585 --> 01:25:30.255
- Fitzgerald pulled you out, I take it?
- Yes.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.626
- How long were you in the hospital?
- Three days, I was pretty done in.

01:25:35.759 --> 01:25:38.613
- You can go, Miss Martin.
- Yes, Sir.

01:25:39.886 --> 01:25:42.803
In the first place,
try to remember this:

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:48.182
You're not the first man nor will you be
the last to have a tough time rounding 50.

01:25:48.187 --> 01:25:50.768
It happens to everybody, male and female.

01:25:50.803 --> 01:25:53.242
Why, it took me 5 years to make it.

01:25:53.277 --> 01:25:57.511
I was 49 for so long, I don't know
to this day, how old I am.

01:25:57.546 --> 01:25:59.296
- Really?
- Sit down.

01:26:02.136 --> 01:26:07.411
As a matter of fact, your case was a breeze
compared to what I went through.

01:26:07.446 --> 01:26:10.009
My trouble, you see, was an ice skater.

01:26:10.244 --> 01:26:15.149
The most radiant, beautiful, bewitching
little creature you could imagine.

01:26:15.184 --> 01:26:19.717
And the amazing part of it was
she could also skate through the air.

01:26:20.052 --> 01:26:23.965
Right through my window and into my room.

01:26:23.966 --> 01:26:27.712
Well, Sir, one night...

01:26:28.247 --> 01:26:34.362
He explained the whole thing, quite simply,
and clearly, what hallucinations are,

01:26:34.497 --> 01:26:42.101
and what a shock like nearly drowning
can do to a man of... well... fifty.

01:26:42.691 --> 01:26:46.896
Oh, for heaven's sake, what's 50
got to do with it? He's crazy.

01:26:46.931 --> 01:26:49.022
Oh, yeah, crazy as a coot.

01:26:49.457 --> 01:26:52.014
You should've heard the nutty
story he told me about himself.

01:26:52.886 --> 01:26:55.856
All about some beautiful ice skater
that came sailing through the air...

01:26:55.948 --> 01:26:58.166
And what's nutty about that?

01:27:04.037 --> 01:27:06.875
- I'm sorry, Darling.
- It's all right, Dear.

01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:10.827
I gave you a pretty bad time of it,
I guess, but it's all over now.

01:27:11.462 --> 01:27:15.233
- Lenore, too?
- After trying to drown me?

01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:24.359
- It's a fine thing, a mermaid for a rival.
- Yeah, pretty silly at that, wasn't it?

01:27:25.863 --> 01:27:29.790
Well, at least I hope the next time you feel
yourself slipping, it'll be for someone real.

01:27:30.325 --> 01:27:31.931
Something flesh and blood,

01:27:31.932 --> 01:27:33.537
people can see and tell me about.

01:27:34.623 --> 01:27:36.354
What's that?

01:27:37.103 --> 01:27:40.158
- A little present.
- Oh, how sweet of you, Arthur.

01:27:41.647 --> 01:27:44.339
Darling, it's beautiful, it's so different.

01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.485
You didn't have to, Dear... really.

01:27:47.819 --> 01:27:52.299
- I know... i wanted to.
- Well, let's see.

01:27:59.964 --> 01:28:01.921
Shall I wear it out tonight?

01:28:02.782 --> 01:28:06.597
- Well, if you want to GO out.
- Don't you?

01:28:08.169 --> 01:28:09.932
Well, I don't know.

01:28:11.234 --> 01:28:14.297
Seems somehow such a pleasant occasion.

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:17.652
I thought it might be nice
if we just had dinner

01:28:17.653 --> 01:28:20.972
up here, and spent the
rest of the evening in...

01:28:21.997 --> 01:28:23.476
together.

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:27.528
Oh, Darling, a very nice idea.

01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:31.950
Very nice.
