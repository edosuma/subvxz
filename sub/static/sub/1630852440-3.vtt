00:06.006 --> 00:08.675
<i>[New Orleans brass band music playing]</i>

00:12.345 --> 00:18.518
<i>[host] </i>Everybody welcome
New Orleans's own Mark Normand!

00:18.601 --> 00:20.729
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:27.694
<i>[audience cheers enthusiastically]</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:35.577
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

00:36.619 --> 00:37.662
<i>Comedy, huh?</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:41.875
<i>Yeah. We're really doing it, folks.</i>
<i>Thanks for coming out. Good to be here.</i>

00:41.958 --> 00:44.335
<i>-[woman whoops]</i>
<i>-Kooky times. Thanks, Mom.</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:45.253
<i>Um…</i>

00:45.837 --> 00:47.505
<i>Oh, yeah. We're all vaccinated.</i>

00:47.589 --> 00:49.132
<i>You guys got the vaccine, huh?</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:51.718
<i>-[audience cheers]</i>
<i>-Yeah. Right. I got mine online.</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:53.303
<i>We'll see what happens. Yeah.</i>

00:53.803 --> 00:56.973
<i>I saw a couple guys on West Side Highway</i>
<i>giving themselves a vaccine.</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:58.850
<i>I was like, "Hey. Good for them."</i>

00:58.933 --> 01:02.187
<i>Yeah, yeah. Must've been the second shot</i>
<i>'cause he was woozy.</i>

01:04.064 --> 01:04.981
<i>All right.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:08.151
<i>Put on a few pounds in the quarantine.</i>

01:08.234 --> 01:11.154
<i>I think we all put on pandemic weight.</i>
<i>The GrubHub, the Seamless.</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:14.282
<i>I gotta cut back</i>
<i>'cause I was a fat kid. I was huge.</i>

01:14.365 --> 01:17.202
<i>I had man-boobs growing up.</i>
<i>Isn't that weird about men?</i>

01:17.285 --> 01:20.246
<i>When men gain weight,</i>
<i>we grow female body parts? Right?</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:22.082
<i>Ladies don't have to worry about that.</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:24.542
<i>If a woman gains weight,</i>
<i>just become a fat lady.</i>

01:24.626 --> 01:27.337
<i>If a guy gains weight,</i>
<i>we also become a fat lady.</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:30.256
<i>But you don't grow male body parts.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:32.383
<i>Not like, "Yeah.</i>
<i>I saw Tammy by the river."</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:34.719
<i>"Whoo! She had a set of balls on her."</i>

01:35.845 --> 01:37.555
<i>There were perks to being a fat kid.</i>

01:37.639 --> 01:41.392
<i>I'd go to a sleepover, my friend's like,</i>
<i>"I wonder what it's like to touch a boob."</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:43.103
<i>I'm like, "You're in luck."</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:47.565
<i>Nobody likes man-boobs.</i>
<i>I've asked around. I've done the research.</i>

01:47.649 --> 01:49.400
<i>Nobody likes a hairy, milkless tit,</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:52.237
<i>and yet man-boobs</i>
<i>are legal all over the country.</i>

01:52.737 --> 01:55.198
<i>Fat guy in Cleveland,</i>
<i>take his shirt off, totally fine.</i>

01:55.281 --> 01:58.159
<i>Woman in Cleveland</i>
<i>takes her shirt off, indecent exposure.</i>

01:58.243 --> 02:00.495
<i>Those are the tits we like.</i>
<i>How'd we fuck that up?</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:03.873
<i>We got weird boob rules in America.</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:05.708
<i>Female tit exposed, illegal.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:07.627
<i>Male tit exposed, legal.</i>

02:07.710 --> 02:10.505
<i>Female tit exposed</i>
<i>with a baby sucking on it, legal.</i>

02:10.588 --> 02:14.467
<i>Male tit exposed</i>
<i>with a baby sucking on it, very illegal.</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:15.760
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

02:16.886 --> 02:18.054
<i>Weird rules.</i>

02:19.639 --> 02:22.475
<i>This is how I look at it.</i>
<i>Female tits are like marijuana.</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:26.396
<i>Fun, harmless,</i>
<i>yet still mostly criminalized. Huh.</i>

02:28.189 --> 02:30.942
<i>Man-boobs are like cigarettes.</i>
<i>Kind of gross, off-putting.</i>

02:31.025 --> 02:33.403
<i>Why the fuck'd you bring</i>
<i>those to the beach?</i>

02:34.445 --> 02:36.072
<i>We legalized the wrong one.</i>

02:38.199 --> 02:41.411
<i>What shocks me, speaking of tits,</i>
<i>my girlfriend's got huge knobs</i>

02:41.494 --> 02:44.038
<i>and women have to walk into a store</i>

02:44.122 --> 02:46.624
<i>and go, "I'm a B. I'm a C. I'm a D."</i>

02:46.708 --> 02:48.084
<i>Guys aren't that strong.</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:50.420
<i>If a guy had to walk around</i>
<i>going, "I'm an A,"</i>

02:50.503 --> 02:52.338
<i>he'd kill himself. [chuckles]</i>

02:53.173 --> 02:55.425
<i>That wouldn't last 20 minutes. Right?</i>

02:55.925 --> 02:59.596
<i>Some guy'd jump off a building.</i>
<i>Suicide note, "A-minus, every time."</i>

02:59.679 --> 03:00.847
<i>"Every time."</i>

03:02.056 --> 03:05.268
<i>Yeah. But it's gotta be said.</i>
<i>It's gotta be said. You know?</i>

03:05.351 --> 03:08.771
<i>I know I'm making fat jokes in 2021.</i>
<i>Already got yelled at.</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:09.731
<i>Somebody came up,</i>

03:09.814 --> 03:12.775
<i>"Hey. Saying the word 'fat' now</i>
<i>is like saying a racial slur."</i>

03:12.859 --> 03:14.194
<i>I was like, "Whoa! Maybe."</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:17.155
<i>"But it's the only slur</i>
<i>that fluctuates." Right?</i>

03:18.615 --> 03:20.700
<i>You can gain and lose weight.</i>
<i>No one's ever like,</i>

03:20.783 --> 03:24.078
<i>"Ooh, around the holidays</i>
<i>I get real Black." [mock laughs]</i>

03:24.162 --> 03:27.165
<i>"Whoo! I gotta go on a diet.</i>
<i>Burn off some of this Mexican."</i>

03:27.248 --> 03:28.166
<i>[mock chuckles]</i>

03:28.708 --> 03:30.210
<i>No. We all make fat jokes.</i>

03:30.293 --> 03:32.629
<i>I don't know anyone</i>
<i>who actually hates fat people.</i>

03:32.712 --> 03:35.757
<i>"This neighborhood was great</i>
<i>'til these fucking porkers moved in."</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:39.260
<i>"I'll tell you that right now."</i>
<i>No. We love fat people, right?</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:42.847
<i>Buddha, Santa, Oprah sometimes.</i>
<i>Yeah. [chuckles]</i>

03:43.431 --> 03:44.349
<i>A-ha.</i>

03:45.516 --> 03:47.143
<i>Yeah. Good to be in New York.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:50.939
<i>Beautiful women in New York.</i>
<i>I mean, none here, but, uh…</i>

03:51.648 --> 03:53.566
<i>I'm joking. I'll go down on you.</i>

03:54.067 --> 03:55.693
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:59.447
<i>Ladies, you know you're very sexy.</i>
<i>Men wanna have sex with you.</i>

03:59.530 --> 04:01.407
<i>You make us work for it, which I get.</i>

04:01.491 --> 04:04.577
<i>Bunch of people were trying to put stuff</i>
<i>inside me, I'd have questions.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:06.704
<i>You gotta earn it, fellas.</i>

04:06.788 --> 04:09.290
<i>I feel like the vagina</i>
<i>is a lot like a university.</i>

04:09.374 --> 04:10.750
<i>You gotta be accepted.</i>

04:11.709 --> 04:14.837
<i>Much like a university, easier to get in</i>
<i>if you have a lot of money.</i>

04:15.922 --> 04:18.424
<i>"How'd that guy get in?</i>
<i>He doesn't have any money."</i>

04:18.508 --> 04:20.093
<i>"Well, he's an athlete."</i>

04:21.052 --> 04:23.054
<i>[laughing and applauding]</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:27.225
<i>-[audience members cheer]</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

04:28.393 --> 04:31.521
<i>Yeah. Very similar to a university.</i>
<i>Some are very prestigious.</i>

04:31.604 --> 04:34.065
<i>"Wow, you got in there?</i>
<i>Impressive. Good for you."</i>

04:34.148 --> 04:35.942
<i>Your other friend's like,</i>
<i>"I got in there."</i>

04:36.025 --> 04:38.987
<i>You're like, "The whole community's</i>
<i>been there." [chuckles]</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:41.114
<i>"And you only got in</i>
<i>'cause your dad got in."</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:51.582
<i>Ladies, you're more attractive than men.</i>
<i>You can be more sexually selective.</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:53.835
<i>You guys pick a sexual partner,</i>
<i>it's a big deal.</i>

04:53.918 --> 04:56.129
<i>A lot of questions, like the NBA draft.</i>

04:56.212 --> 04:59.132
<i>"How old is he?</i>
<i>Where'd he go to college? How tall is he?"</i>

04:59.215 --> 05:01.968
<i>Men, we pick a sexual partner</i>
<i>like it's a pick-up game.</i>

05:02.051 --> 05:03.928
<i>"I'll take you, you, you…"</i>

05:04.929 --> 05:07.515
<i>"You're out of shape,</i>
<i>but I know you'll work harder."</i>

05:09.642 --> 05:12.020
<i>One of my friends is gorgeous,</i>
<i>she could have any guy.</i>

05:12.103 --> 05:16.107
<i>She's always making these big statements.</i>
<i>"I'd never have sex with a Republican."</i>

05:16.190 --> 05:19.027
<i>I said, "Really?"</i>
<i>She said, "Yeah. If I was naked, in bed,</i>

05:19.110 --> 05:21.696
<i>I found out he was a Republican,</i>
<i>I would change my mind."</i>

05:21.779 --> 05:25.742
<i>I was like, "If I was in that position,</i>
<i>I would change my political party."</i>

05:27.618 --> 05:29.746
<i>What do I care?</i>
<i>It's not like it'll come up.</i>

05:29.829 --> 05:33.333
<i>She's not gonna be on top like…</i>
<i>[moaning] "Climate change is a hoax."</i>

05:38.004 --> 05:40.214
<i>I will say, if I have sex</i>
<i>with a Republican lady,</i>

05:40.298 --> 05:41.424
<i>I'm wearing a condom.</i>

05:41.507 --> 05:43.760
<i>If anything happens,</i>
<i>she'll probably wanna keep it.</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:47.055
<i>-[scattered applause]</i>
<i>-All right.</i>

05:47.138 --> 05:49.349
<i>Abortion jokes coming at you.</i>

05:51.267 --> 05:53.770
<i>I don't know where you guys</i>
<i>stand on abortion, which side.</i>

05:53.853 --> 05:56.898
<i>I look at abortion the same way</i>
<i>as reclining my seat on an airplane.</i>

05:56.981 --> 06:00.902
<i>I know it pisses a lot of people off,</i>
<i>but if I got the option, I'm taking it.</i>

06:00.985 --> 06:03.905
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

06:03.988 --> 06:06.574
<i>Right? People say,</i>
<i>"Which way do you lean?"</i>

06:06.657 --> 06:07.992
<i>I say, "I lean back."</i>

06:09.452 --> 06:10.328
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:11.537 --> 06:13.873
<i>Yeah. But men are horny.</i>
<i>We're horny, fellas.</i>

06:13.956 --> 06:16.667
<i>It sucks.</i>
<i>Sucks how horny we are. It's not fun.</i>

06:16.751 --> 06:19.295
<i>Then women always go,</i>
<i>"We're just as horny as men."</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:20.213
<i>Come on.</i>

06:21.130 --> 06:21.964
<i>Come on, ladies.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:25.843
<i>You don't know what it's like</i>
<i>to go to a family reunion and go,</i>

06:25.927 --> 06:27.387
<i>"I would do it." [chuckles]</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:28.971
<i>[audience exclaims and laughs]</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:30.306
<i>It's a sickness.</i>

06:31.140 --> 06:33.518
<i>Clouds our judgment.</i>
<i>We can't think clearly.</i>

06:33.601 --> 06:37.480
<i>It's why every great invention from a man</i>
<i>has been thought up after an orgasm.</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:40.733
<i>It's the only time he can think straight.</i>
<i>A guy's like… [groans]</i>

06:41.275 --> 06:42.110
<i>"Air fryer."</i>

06:46.531 --> 06:49.409
<i>Yeah. I got into a fight</i>
<i>with my friend about this.</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.411
<i>She's like, "We're as horny as men."</i>

06:51.494 --> 06:54.705
<i>I was like, "Would you have sex with me?"</i>
<i>And she was like, "No."</i>

06:55.456 --> 06:58.459
<i>I was like, "I'd have sex with you.</i>
<i>I guess that settles it."</i>

06:59.127 --> 07:01.337
<i>She said, "That's different.</i>
<i>I'm not attracted to you."</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:04.382
<i>I'm like, "I'm not attracted</i>
<i>to you either." [chuckles]</i>

07:05.049 --> 07:07.176
<i>What does that have to do with anything?</i>

07:07.260 --> 07:10.471
<i>Obviously, ladies, you guys get horny too,</i>
<i>but you gotta hide it.</i>

07:10.555 --> 07:13.057
<i>You can't let that out.</i>
<i>You'd get tackled at a Chili's.</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:14.308
<i>You can't let that out.</i>

07:14.851 --> 07:17.895
<i>You gotta hide it,</i>
<i>but you do let out your emotions, ladies.</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:21.107
<i>My girlfriend said</i>
<i>she's cried every day since high school.</i>

07:21.190 --> 07:22.483
<i>I said, "Wow, are you okay?"</i>

07:22.567 --> 07:25.069
<i>She goes, "Yeah, just something I do.</i>
<i>I get all worked up,</i>

07:25.153 --> 07:26.988
<i>go hide, and ruin a box of tissues."</i>

07:27.071 --> 07:29.740
<i>I said, "Huh!</i>
<i>We actually have a similar daily thing."</i>

07:31.742 --> 07:34.954
<i>She was like, "Yeah. If I don't</i>
<i>knock it out, I can't function."</i>

07:35.037 --> 07:36.873
<i>I'm like, "You and me both, sister."</i>

07:37.540 --> 07:39.750
<i>She said, "Sometimes,</i>
<i>I watch a movie, I just lose it."</i>

07:39.834 --> 07:41.502
<i>I'm like, "I do the movie thing too."</i>

07:42.378 --> 07:44.464
<i>I said, "You just watch</i>
<i>30 seconds of a movie?"</i>

07:44.547 --> 07:46.674
<i>She's like, "What?" I'm like, "Nah!"</i>

07:48.634 --> 07:49.719
<i>It's how we're wired.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:52.305
<i>Ladies get emotional at weird times,</i>
<i>men get horny.</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:55.016
<i>Every woman's been at work,</i>
<i>"I don't know why I'm crying."</i>

07:55.099 --> 07:58.561
<i>Every guy's been to a funeral,</i>
<i>"I don't know why I'm hard." [chuckles]</i>

07:59.103 --> 08:00.688
<i>It's that damn open casket.</i>

08:04.317 --> 08:06.277
<i>But thank God, ladies.</i>

08:06.360 --> 08:10.364
<i>Thank God, ladies! You can find things</i>
<i>sexy that have nothing to do with sex.</i>

08:10.448 --> 08:13.451
<i>Thank God. You find things sexy</i>
<i>that have nothing to do with sex.</i>

08:13.534 --> 08:15.453
<i>You have to</i>
<i>'cause this ain't doing it.</i>

08:15.953 --> 08:18.623
<i>You gotta dig deeper.</i>
<i>If a guy gets naked in front of you,</i>

08:18.706 --> 08:21.542
<i>you're like… [straining]</i>
<i>"Remember he's a good driver."</i>

08:23.836 --> 08:27.882
<i>You find things sexy… First time I took</i>
<i>my girlfriend out, I planned it all out.</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:29.759
<i>Dinner, drinks, movie, ice cream.</i>

08:29.842 --> 08:32.303
<i>She was like,</i>
<i>"Wow, you planned it out. That was hot."</i>

08:32.386 --> 08:35.640
<i>Ah? Planning. That's hot? Planning?</i>

08:36.265 --> 08:39.685
<i>Planning? Said a funny joke.</i>
<i>"Good sense of humor. That's a turn-on."</i>

08:39.769 --> 08:42.605
<i>Ah? Pay with cash?</i>
<i>"Got some money. That's sexy."</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:45.107
<i>But all those things</i>
<i>in the bedroom, not sexy.</i>

08:45.191 --> 08:48.778
<i>We were making out, I take out a condom.</i>
<i>She goes, "Whoa! Little presumptuous?"</i>

08:48.861 --> 08:50.988
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, yeah. I planned all this."</i>

08:52.573 --> 08:54.450
<i>I thought you liked that? All right.</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:55.451
<i>Now it's weird.</i>

08:55.535 --> 08:57.912
<i>Oh, yeah. She likes funny.</i>
<i>I'll roast her a bit.</i>

08:57.995 --> 08:59.914
<i>"You call that a clit?" [mock laughs]</i>

09:02.500 --> 09:05.670
<i>Clearly hilarious.</i>
<i>All of a sudden, not hot. What the hell?</i>

09:06.420 --> 09:07.964
<i>She's getting dressed, she's leaving.</i>

09:08.047 --> 09:11.300
<i>I was like, "Oh! She likes money."</i>
<i>"Here. This is for your time."</i>

09:12.843 --> 09:15.888
<i>Fascinating, ladies. I listen to you gals.</i>

09:15.972 --> 09:18.933
<i>From what I can gather,</i>
<i>you like sex when it's elaborate.</i>

09:19.016 --> 09:21.936
<i>Anytime a woman describes</i>
<i>a sexual encounter, it's complex.</i>

09:22.019 --> 09:23.187
<i>"He took me to Paris."</i>

09:23.271 --> 09:25.690
<i>"We made love on the balcony</i>
<i>overlooking the ocean."</i>

09:25.773 --> 09:27.858
<i>All the girls are like… [exclaim]</i>

09:27.942 --> 09:30.403
<i>For a guy, the less elaborate, the hotter.</i>

09:30.486 --> 09:33.406
<i>Like, "We're about to go to the mall,</i>
<i>end up fucking in the hallway,</i>

09:33.489 --> 09:34.865
<i>didn't have to go to the mall."</i>

09:36.158 --> 09:38.286
<i>And all the guys are like… [exclaim]</i>

09:39.245 --> 09:41.664
<i>Just tell us what you want, ladies.</i>
<i>We'll do it.</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:44.000
<i>We wanna make you happy,</i>
<i>please you. Just tell us.</i>

09:44.083 --> 09:48.421
<i>"But I want you to figure it out."</i>
<i>It's not gonna happen. Just tell us. Yeah.</i>

09:48.504 --> 09:51.007
<i>Always amazes me</i>
<i>what gets a woman's motor running.</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:52.842
<i>I took my girl to a pet shop once.</i>

09:52.925 --> 09:54.927
<i>Holy shit. Ladies, the pet shop…</i>

09:55.011 --> 09:57.346
<i>[whistles] That is your strip club.</i>

09:58.389 --> 10:01.767
<i>My God! A woman in a pet shop</i>
<i>is like a horny guy at a strip club.</i>

10:01.851 --> 10:05.563
<i>You walk in, you can barely handle it.</i>
<i>"Oh, my God. I wanna touch 'em all."</i>

10:06.314 --> 10:09.817
<i>Had to say, "Relax. Some of these are</i>
<i>from broken homes. They might attack."</i>

10:10.735 --> 10:12.570
<i>She went down the line like a horny guy.</i>

10:12.653 --> 10:16.032
<i>"Beautiful, gorgeous, perfect.</i>
<i>That's my favorite. I like that one."</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:20.870
<i>The manager's like, "Yeah. That's Roxy.</i>
<i>Everybody likes Roxy. Bring over Roxy."</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:22.830
<i>They bring Roxy and go to a private area.</i>

10:22.913 --> 10:25.625
<i>Got Roxy on her lap.</i>
<i>She's like, "She's in love with me!"</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:28.878
<i>I'm like, "No!</i>
<i>She's looking for a better life." [laughs]</i>

10:30.755 --> 10:31.714
<i>Come on.</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:35.134
<i>-[audience applauds]</i>
<i>-Yeah. Oh, hey. There you go.</i>

10:37.845 --> 10:38.804
<i>All right.</i>

10:39.472 --> 10:41.849
<i>Yeah. Hot group.</i>
<i>But I gotta get my act together.</i>

10:41.932 --> 10:45.227
<i>You got your act together, sir.</i>
<i>You got glasses. Yeah.</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:47.063
<i>I gotta get my act together.</i>

10:47.146 --> 10:49.106
<i>Had a pregnancy scare last week.</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.484
<i>You remember. Yeah, yeah. You know.</i>

10:52.109 --> 10:54.362
<i>Got a couple pregnancy tests,</i>
<i>just to be sure.</i>

10:54.445 --> 10:56.739
<i>When she wasn't looking, I peed on one.</i>

10:56.822 --> 10:59.241
<i>Yeah. Came up positive. That's weird.</i>

10:59.325 --> 11:02.495
<i>So I googled it,</i>
<i>said I might have testicular cancer.</i>

11:02.578 --> 11:05.790
<i>I was like, "Well, shit.</i>
<i>Still better than a kid." [laughs]</i>

11:06.791 --> 11:09.377
<i>That's the only time</i>
<i>cancer is better than children,</i>

11:09.460 --> 11:11.754
<i>'cause people actually get happy</i>
<i>when you beat it.</i>

11:11.837 --> 11:14.256
<i>[audience groans and laughs]</i>

11:15.925 --> 11:18.761
<i>Yeah. My gal,</i>
<i>she's a real tomcat in the sack.</i>

11:18.844 --> 11:21.555
<i>She likes to use a vibrator</i>
<i>in the bedroom while I watch.</i>

11:21.639 --> 11:24.141
<i>Pretty hot,</i>
<i>but after a while you feel obsolete.</i>

11:24.975 --> 11:28.437
<i>Feels like I'm an employee at CVS</i>
<i>and she's using the self-checkout.</i>

11:30.606 --> 11:34.318
<i>I'm like, "You know what you're doing,</i>
<i>but if you hit a snag, I'm your man."</i>

11:35.444 --> 11:39.281
<i>After a half-hour, you're like,</i>
<i>"Shit. These robots are taking our job."</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:44.078
<i>She's fun. Likes to do stuff in public,</i>

11:44.161 --> 11:46.288
<i>which is sexy,</i>
<i>but it gives you weird situations.</i>

11:46.372 --> 11:49.583
<i>We were at a grocery store,</i>
<i>she stuck her butt out and I spanked it.</i>

11:49.667 --> 11:52.712
<i>This six-year-old kid runs up</i>
<i>and he goes, "What'd she do?"</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:57.758
<i>"What do you mean?"</i>
<i>He's like, "Is she a bad girl?"</i>

11:57.842 --> 11:59.844
<i>I'm like, "She's a bad girl, all right."</i>

12:00.594 --> 12:03.305
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>me and this kid are saying the same thing,</i>

12:03.389 --> 12:05.433
<i>but having</i>
<i>a completely different conversation.</i>

12:05.516 --> 12:07.685
<i>He says, "Is she naughty?"</i>
<i>I'm like, "She is."</i>

12:07.768 --> 12:11.230
<i>He says, "Does she have a lot of toys?"</i>
<i>I'm like, "Her bedroom's full of toys."</i>

12:11.313 --> 12:13.858
<i>He says, "Do what my parents do</i>
<i>to me when I'm in trouble."</i>

12:13.941 --> 12:16.193
<i>I'm like, "What?"</i>
<i>"Use her toys in front of her."</i>

12:16.277 --> 12:18.362
<i>I'm like, "Damn. Maybe I will." [laughs]</i>

12:18.988 --> 12:20.865
<i>Wow, this kid's filthy.</i>

12:23.075 --> 12:25.995
<i>Yeah. My lady's been</i>
<i>pushing marriage pretty hard.</i>

12:26.078 --> 12:28.789
<i>I'm getting older,</i>
<i>so maybe I'll pull the trigger</i>

12:28.873 --> 12:30.958
<i>and kill myself. Yeah, yeah.</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:34.795
<i>I don't know. Married men, huh?</i>
<i>They grow weird and quiet.</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:38.507
<i>Kind of sweater vest-y. You know?</i>
<i>Married men become obsessed with stuff.</i>

12:38.591 --> 12:42.887
<i>Have you noticed that? Cars, guitars,</i>
<i>sneakers, memorabilia, model trains.</i>

12:43.471 --> 12:45.973
<i>You never see a single guy</i>
<i>with a model train.</i>

12:46.056 --> 12:48.601
<i>You never go to your buddy</i>
<i>like, "Wanna hit the club?"</i>

12:48.684 --> 12:51.270
<i>He's like, "Shh!</i>
<i>It's about to go through the tunnel."</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:53.481
<i>No, it's never that!</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:57.985
<i>It's some married guy in a basement going,</i>
<i>"I'm the goddamn mayor down here." Right?</i>

12:58.068 --> 12:59.153
<i>"Choo-choo!"</i>

13:01.197 --> 13:02.615
<i>My friend's wife left him.</i>

13:02.698 --> 13:06.035
<i>She walked out after eight years</i>
<i>'cause he knows nothing about her.</i>

13:06.118 --> 13:09.121
<i>Can't say one fact, so she left.</i>
<i>Good for her, I don't blame her.</i>

13:09.205 --> 13:11.123
<i>He can describe a watch for 20 minutes.</i>

13:11.207 --> 13:14.210
<i>"This is a 1941 Submariner.</i>
<i>Super-rare. Nickel-plated."</i>

13:14.293 --> 13:17.421
<i>"Dude, if you knew this much</i>
<i>about your wife, she wouldn't have left."</i>

13:17.505 --> 13:18.964
<i>It's weird when I hear women say,</i>

13:19.048 --> 13:21.175
<i>"I'm a person.</i>
<i>Don't treat me like an object."</i>

13:21.258 --> 13:23.052
<i>I'm like, "No, that's what you want."</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:26.597
<i>Men with objects? They're obsessed!</i>
<i>It'd be the best he ever treated you.</i>

13:26.680 --> 13:29.141
<i>Most guys don't know their girl.</i>
<i>Treat you like an object,</i>

13:29.225 --> 13:32.061
<i>he'll know everything.</i>
<i>"This is a 1988 Connecticut Jew."</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:37.316
<i>"Yeah. Keep her in the basement.</i>
<i>Temperature control."</i>

13:38.400 --> 13:41.028
<i>At least you're not watching porn.</i>
<i>Sir, you like the porn.</i>

13:41.111 --> 13:43.239
<i>You've got big forearms. Yeah.</i>

13:44.406 --> 13:46.116
<i>Too much porn out there.</i>

13:46.784 --> 13:50.037
<i>Porn is too easy to get.</i>
<i>When I was a kid, porn was hard to find.</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:53.999
<i>Remember? You had to steal a </i>Playboy<i>,</i>
<i>go to the woods with your scoutmaster.</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:57.878
<i>Now porn's in your pocket.</i>

13:58.379 --> 14:00.297
<i>Porn's become like coffee now, for me.</i>

14:00.381 --> 14:03.467
<i>I do it every day, I barely feel,</i>
<i>and it's gotta be Black.</i>

14:04.301 --> 14:06.387
<i>[laughing and scattered applause]</i>

14:06.470 --> 14:07.304
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:08.138 --> 14:10.391
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>
<i>why men watch so much porn.</i>

14:10.474 --> 14:12.852
<i>I figured out why.</i>
<i>Porn makes everything better.</i>

14:12.935 --> 14:15.479
<i>Look at all the porn categories.</i>
<i>It's all stuff I hate.</i>

14:15.563 --> 14:20.067
<i>Office, teacher, hospital, gym,</i>
<i>I hate all these things.</i>

14:20.150 --> 14:22.027
<i>But now that it's porn, I'm into it.</i>

14:22.528 --> 14:24.697
<i>Hell, before porn I hated my step-family.</i>

14:30.786 --> 14:34.081
<i>During this pandemic, I'm watching</i>
<i>too much porn and too much UFC.</i>

14:34.164 --> 14:38.335
<i>They're starting to blend together.</i>
<i>They're trading places in my mind.</i>

14:38.419 --> 14:41.046
<i>When I watch UFC now,</i>
<i>I'm like, "This is weirdly sexual."</i>

14:41.130 --> 14:43.424
<i>Then I watch porn,</i>
<i>I'm like, "This is oddly violent."</i>

14:44.008 --> 14:45.718
<i>Even the terms have traded places.</i>

14:45.801 --> 14:49.263
<i>All the sex terms sound violent</i>
<i>and all the fight terms sound sexy.</i>

14:49.346 --> 14:53.225
<i>Ever listen to fight terms? They're hot.</i>
<i>Full mount, rear-naked choke,</i>

14:53.767 --> 14:56.312
<i>ground-and-pound. [exhales]</i>

14:56.395 --> 14:58.355
<i>And all the sex terms now sound violent.</i>

14:58.439 --> 15:02.776
<i>Bang, smash, I'd hit that, beat it up.</i>
<i>"What happened to Jill?" "She got fisted."</i>

15:02.860 --> 15:04.778
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

15:06.071 --> 15:08.699
<i>Everybody likes to trash UFC.</i>
<i>"Oh, it's so barbaric."</i>

15:08.782 --> 15:11.744
<i>I think it's more decent than porn.</i>
<i>At least there's a referee.</i>

15:12.453 --> 15:14.330
<i>We've all seen pornos and been like,</i>

15:14.413 --> 15:18.083
<i>"Jesus Christ, it's four-on-one.</i>
<i>Somebody gonna put a stop to this shit?"</i>

15:18.167 --> 15:19.710
<i>"Poor woman's in trouble."</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:24.173
<i>How about these female UFC fighters?</i>
<i>They're tough as hell.</i>

15:24.256 --> 15:26.842
<i>I dated a Puerto Rican gal</i>
<i>from the Bronx for a while.</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:30.262
<i>She was really scrappy. She said,</i>
<i>"I should've been a UFC fighter."</i>

15:30.346 --> 15:33.307
<i>I'm like, "There's no way!"</i>
<i>She's like, "You don't think I'm tough?"</i>

15:33.390 --> 15:35.976
<i>I'm like, "No, they just put</i>
<i>your age and weight onscreen."</i>

15:37.561 --> 15:40.481
<i>The two things you don't ask a woman.</i>
<i>They put it right on TV.</i>

15:40.564 --> 15:42.942
<i>Imagine a guy,</i>
<i>ask the two most vulnerable questions.</i>

15:43.025 --> 15:44.318
<i>"Wanna be a fighter?" "Yeah!"</i>

15:44.401 --> 15:47.071
<i>"What's your bank account and dick size?"</i>
<i>"I'm out."</i>

15:50.407 --> 15:51.533
<i>I've dated enough women,</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.702
<i>I'd be a good corner-man</i>
<i>for a female fighter.</i>

15:53.786 --> 15:56.622
<i>If she was losing the fight,</i>
<i>I would just yell, "Calm down."</i>

15:56.705 --> 15:57.581
<i>She's like…</i>

15:59.750 --> 16:01.001
<i>"You're overreacting."</i>

16:02.294 --> 16:03.754
<i>"You're just like your mother."</i>

16:03.837 --> 16:04.797
<i>[screams]</i>

16:05.464 --> 16:06.632
<i>Other lady's dead.</i>

16:09.343 --> 16:12.805
<i>All right, you guys are fun.</i>
<i>A lot of crowds, very sensitive nowadays.</i>

16:12.888 --> 16:15.307
<i>Look, some comedians out there</i>
<i>hate woke people.</i>

16:15.391 --> 16:17.226
<i>I mean, none more than Cosby.</i>

16:19.853 --> 16:21.855
<i>[audience applauding]</i>

16:24.566 --> 16:26.777
<i>That's one comic you shouldn't sleep on.</i>

16:28.779 --> 16:32.282
<i>At least you guys are out of the house.</i>
<i>You're living your goddamn lives.</i>

16:32.366 --> 16:34.284
<i>A lot of people are rotting away</i>
<i>on the Internet.</i>

16:34.368 --> 16:36.453
<i>Just fighting with people.</i>
<i>Bitching, moaning.</i>

16:36.537 --> 16:40.541
<i>I get shit all the time on Twitter.</i>
<i>"This comedian said 'queef.'"</i>

16:40.624 --> 16:41.667
<i>[mock exclaims]</i>

16:42.584 --> 16:46.088
<i>I'm like, "This is your day?</i>
<i>Go outside, get a hobby, kill yourself."</i>

16:46.171 --> 16:47.506
<i>"What are you doing?"</i>

16:47.589 --> 16:50.009
<i>"We're on Earth for a blip.</i>
<i>This is how you spend it?"</i>

16:50.092 --> 16:53.595
<i>"400 million sperm didn't make it,</i>
<i>you make it, spend 9 hours on Facebook?"</i>

16:53.679 --> 16:56.724
<i>"You could've learned the xylophone,</i>
<i>you dickbag. Hug your kids."</i>

16:57.975 --> 17:00.436
<i>That's why I like animals.</i>
<i>Animals don't tweet.</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:02.938
<i>Animals have horrible lives,</i>
<i>they never bring it up.</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:05.566
<i>Could you imagine</i>
<i>if an antelope in Africa could tweet?</i>

17:05.649 --> 17:07.651
<i>It would put</i>
<i>all our bullshit in perspective.</i>

17:07.735 --> 17:10.362
<i>Antelope's like, "Haven't eaten</i>
<i>in a week, finally found water,</i>

17:10.446 --> 17:13.657
<i>I watched a crocodile eat</i>
<i>my only child. FML." [chuckles sadly]</i>

17:15.951 --> 17:18.954
<i>That's the best quality about animals,</i>
<i>they don't complain.</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:22.416
<i>That's why I like </i>Planet Earth<i>.</i>
<i>Horrible stuff happens, they deal with it.</i>

17:22.499 --> 17:24.418
<i>You watch a zebra running from four lions,</i>

17:24.501 --> 17:26.503
<i>they bite his ass,</i>
<i>pull him down by his neck,</i>

17:26.587 --> 17:30.049
<i>he manages to kick one in the face,</i>
<i>he gets away, and that's just it.</i>

17:30.132 --> 17:33.761
<i>That's it. There's no scene later</i>
<i>where the zebra's like… [inhales]</i>

17:33.844 --> 17:38.057
<i>"Well, that was a fucking hate crime, huh?</i>
<i>Jesus Christ."</i>

17:38.682 --> 17:41.185
<i>"It's hard out here. Wow, that was wild."</i>

17:41.268 --> 17:45.481
<i>"They were trying to kill me. Holy hell.</i>
<i>It's hard out here for a zebra."</i>

17:45.564 --> 17:48.400
<i>"It's 'cause I'm biracial.</i>
<i>I'll tell you that right now."</i>

17:49.651 --> 17:52.654
<i>Animals are the best.</i>
<i>They won't rat you out, never complain.</i>

17:52.738 --> 17:55.616
<i>I say the N-word to my cat,</i>
<i>it doesn't even blink.</i>

17:57.284 --> 17:58.535
<i>Try it. It's fun.</i>

18:00.788 --> 18:01.914
<i>Good times.</i>

18:04.458 --> 18:08.128
<i>Yeah. And I get it. We got problems.</i>
<i>We're not perfect. Yadda, yadda.</i>

18:08.212 --> 18:11.048
<i>Some people just want attention.</i>
<i>They don't wanna help anybody.</i>

18:11.131 --> 18:15.094
<i>Saw college kids on Twitter try to get</i>
Friends <i>taken off a streaming platform.</i>

18:15.177 --> 18:18.639
<i>Like, </i>"Friends<i> is offensive."</i>
<i>I was like, </i>"Friends?<i> Really?"</i>

18:18.722 --> 18:20.140
<i>You ever read the Bible?</i>

18:21.642 --> 18:25.312
<i>The Bible's nothing but rape, homophobia,</i>
<i>misogyny, murder, incest, pedophilia.</i>

18:25.395 --> 18:29.233
<i>Like, "Yeah, but the Bible's not real."</i>
<i>All right. Well, neither is Chandler.</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:32.903
<i>The Bible's insane.</i>
<i>I went to Catholic school, I read it.</i>

18:32.986 --> 18:34.738
<i>It's weird we put our hand on it in court.</i>

18:34.822 --> 18:37.241
<i>"This is the book?</i>
<i>This terrifying piece of literature?"</i>

18:37.324 --> 18:39.118
<i>Guy's on trial for killing his brother.</i>

18:39.201 --> 18:42.746
<i>"You swear to tell the whole truth?"</i>
<i>He's like, "On that thing? Fuck yeah."</i>

18:43.664 --> 18:45.624
<i>"You kidding?</i>
<i>That's where I got the idea."</i>

18:47.042 --> 18:48.293
<i>What a crazy concept.</i>

18:48.377 --> 18:51.213
<i>To tell the truth, my hand</i>
<i>is on a book clearly based in fiction.</i>

18:51.296 --> 18:53.465
<i>At least put my hand</i>
<i>on like </i>The Diary of Anne Frank,

18:53.549 --> 18:56.218
<i>Like, "All right,</i>
<i>shit, I did it." [laughs]</i>

18:57.010 --> 19:00.347
<i>At least that's real.</i>
<i>I mean, not the Holocaust, but the book.</i>

19:01.557 --> 19:04.143
<i>Ah, the Holocaust.</i>

19:04.726 --> 19:06.478
<i>What a bummer that was, huh?</i>

19:08.021 --> 19:08.897
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:08.981 --> 19:12.109
<i>Man, I went to the Holocaust Museum once.</i>

19:12.192 --> 19:14.903
<i>Nothing more depressing</i>
<i>than a Holocaust photo.</i>

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
<i>Who's that guy? The guy taking pics…</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:20.659
<i>"All right. Everybody, get together.</i>
<i>Come on, bring it in. Here we go."</i>

19:20.742 --> 19:23.036
<i>"You got it. Right there."</i>
<i>"No, we're too thin!"</i>

19:23.120 --> 19:25.873
<i>"Don't worry. The camera adds</i>
<i>ten pounds. I got you."</i>

<i>Big fan of the Jews.</i>

19:41.763 --> 19:45.017

20:11.793 --> 20:13.879
<i>From horrible events</i>

<i>Horrible events lead to great information.</i>

<i>You walk out the house, some guy's like,</i>

<i>That guy's a pig, but you got some intel.</i>

20:39.655 --> 20:42.866
<i>But you gotta be upset about something.</i>
<i>It gives you personality.</i>

20:42.950 --> 20:46.203
<i>One of my friends just found out</i>
<i>he's 1/16th Native American.</i>

20:46.286 --> 20:48.580

<i>He's like, "Jeep Cherokee?</i>
<i>You believe that shit?"</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:54.670
<i>I said, "The car bothers you?"</i>
<i>"Yeah, it's offensive."</i>

<i>Ah, yes.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:07.266
<i>Trans. Trans is the tough one now</i>
<i>to talk about. You know?</i>

21:07.349 --> 21:10.060
<i>Everybody gets all queefy.</i>
<i>You know? I get it.</i>

21:10.143 --> 21:10.978
<i>Ah…</i>

21:11.687 --> 21:15.232
<i>It's weird there's people that hate</i>
<i>trans people. "Argh! Trans people."</i>

21:15.315 --> 21:17.442
<i>I don't know. What the hell do I care?</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:20.445
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>
<i>Weird to hate a whole group. Yeah.</i>

21:20.529 --> 21:23.949
<i>Although I did get yelled at</i>
<i>by a trans woman recently, at a show.</i>

21:24.032 --> 21:26.410
<i>She chewed me out in the lobby.</i>
<i>She was so mean.</i>

21:26.493 --> 21:30.080
<i>She was like, "I hate your comedy,</i>
<i>you're not funny, and I don't like you."</i>

21:30.163 --> 21:31.164
<i>I was like, "Well,</i>

21:32.124 --> 21:33.417
<i>you look like a man."</i>

21:37.713 --> 21:39.673
<i>She was like, "Oh, you're transphobic?"</i>

21:39.756 --> 21:43.593
<i>I was like, "What? Transphobic? No.</i>
<i>I was just trying to hurt your feelings."</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:47.431
<i>"You said the meanest stuff</i>
<i>you could to me,</i>

21:47.514 --> 21:50.350
<i>so I assume</i>
<i>it's the meanest stuff I can say to you."</i>

21:50.434 --> 21:52.894
<i>"Why would I be transph…</i>
<i>Do you hate all comedians?"</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:54.313
<i>She was like, "No. Just you."</i>

21:54.396 --> 21:57.316
<i>I'm like, "Yeah.</i>
<i>That's how I feel." [chuckles]</i>

21:58.442 --> 22:01.862
<i>She was like, "You're not funny."</i>
<i>I'm like, "But I feel funny inside."</i>

22:01.945 --> 22:05.407
<i>"So who are you to tell me who I am?"</i>

22:05.490 --> 22:06.366
<i>[exclaims]</i>

22:06.450 --> 22:10.287
<i>So it got pretty awkward,</i>
<i>but, you know, we fucked.</i>

22:10.370 --> 22:11.621
<i>So, uh…</i>

22:13.040 --> 22:14.666
<i>all's well that ends well.</i>

22:15.751 --> 22:17.627
<i>No. I'm impressed with trans people.</i>

22:17.711 --> 22:20.672
<i>Takes a lot of courage</i>
<i>to correct someone on who you are.</i>

22:20.756 --> 22:23.675
<i>I don't have that shit.</i>
<i>They say, "It's not 'him', it's 'her.'"</i>

22:23.759 --> 22:26.345
<i>You get my name wrong,</i>
<i>I go with it. My name's Mark.</i>

22:26.428 --> 22:29.014
<i>You say, "What's up, Mike?"</i>
<i>I'm like, "Pretty good."</i>

22:30.766 --> 22:32.142
<i>I'd be the worst trans person.</i>

22:32.225 --> 22:34.061
<i>You get my gender wrong, I go with it.</i>

22:34.144 --> 22:36.396
<i>At my parents',</i>
<i>the phone rings, "Mrs. Normand?"</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:39.900
<i>"This is she." I just go with it.</i>
<i>I don't wanna make waves.</i>

22:40.942 --> 22:42.944
<i>But, I know, touchy stuff. Touchy stuff.</i>

22:43.028 --> 22:45.280
<i>Racial stuff, always touchy. You know?</i>

22:45.364 --> 22:48.825
<i>I got no hatred towards any group.</i>
<i>We're all the same color on the inside.</i>

22:48.909 --> 22:50.994
<i>Well, except for smokers. You know?</i>

22:51.703 --> 22:55.707
<i>I don't mean to pick on smokers.</i>
<i>I know you're a dying breed. But, yeah.</i>

22:55.791 --> 22:58.919
<i>I try to be a conscious guy.</i>
<i>I grew up in a Black neighborhood.</i>

22:59.002 --> 23:00.170
<i>Sometimes too conscious!</i>

23:00.253 --> 23:03.840
<i>On the phone with my insurance agent,</i>
<i>he's like, "What color is your car?"</i>

23:03.924 --> 23:05.967
<i>I said, "Geez,</i>
<i>I thought you were Progressive."</i>

23:09.137 --> 23:11.348
<i>But, you know, times are tense.</i>

23:11.431 --> 23:14.142
<i>We call a lot of shit racist now,</i>
<i>and some shit </i>is<i> racist.</i>

23:14.226 --> 23:15.644
<i>A lot of shit's just ignorant.</i>

23:15.727 --> 23:19.064
<i>I was with my nephew, he's seven.</i>
<i>Ever hang out with a seven-year-old boy?</i>

23:19.147 --> 23:21.608
<i>It's like hanging out</i>
<i>with a coked-up alt-right person.</i>

23:22.818 --> 23:25.779
<i>They just say</i>
<i>the wildest, most unfiltered stuff.</i>

23:25.862 --> 23:29.282
<i>He'll be like, "Why does</i>
<i>that Chinese guy have weird eyes?"</i>

23:29.366 --> 23:33.453
<i>I'm like, "Shut the fuck up.</i>
<i>You can't say that. Jesus Christ."</i>

23:33.537 --> 23:36.665
<i>He doesn't hate Chinese people.</i>
<i>He's not a racist. He's ignorant.</i>

23:36.748 --> 23:38.208
<i>He says horrible stuff to women.</i>

23:38.291 --> 23:40.585
<i>"She's fat, she's old.</i>
<i>What's with the mustache, lady?"</i>

23:40.669 --> 23:43.964
<i>I'm like, "He's got Down syndrome.</i>
<i>Don't worry about him."</i>

23:44.714 --> 23:46.716
<i>He's ignorant. I took him to a protest.</i>

23:46.800 --> 23:49.219
<i>I was like, "Remember, Bobby.</i>
<i>Black lives matter."</i>

23:49.302 --> 23:51.304
<i>"But I'm not Black.</i>
<i>Don't all lives matter?"</i>

23:51.388 --> 23:55.058
<i>I was like, "Shut the fuck up.</i>
<i>You're gonna get us killed."</i>

23:55.725 --> 23:58.645
<i>The kid's adorable,</i>
<i>but on paper, he's a Nazi.</i>

24:00.147 --> 24:03.108
<i>I get it. There's a lot</i>
<i>of honkies in here tonight. Hey!</i>

24:03.191 --> 24:05.694
<i>White people, huh?</i>
<i>Things have changed a little.</i>

24:05.777 --> 24:08.488
<i>We're nervous now.</i>
<i>We're scared to say the wrong thing.</i>

24:08.572 --> 24:11.032
<i>We're scared of getting</i>
<i>in trouble and yelled at.</i>

24:11.116 --> 24:12.117
<i>That's our big fear.</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:14.161
<i>Others are scared</i>
<i>of getting shot, deported.</i>

24:14.244 --> 24:16.121
<i>We're scared of getting yelled at.</i>

24:16.204 --> 24:19.207
<i>When I was a kid, you got yelled at</i>
<i>for what you were attracted to.</i>

24:19.291 --> 24:21.501
<i>"What? Are you gay? You like dudes?"</i>
<i>"I'm not gay."</i>

24:21.585 --> 24:23.336
<i>Now you get yelled at</i>
<i>for what you're not.</i>

24:23.420 --> 24:25.422
<i>"You like trans women?"</i>
<i>"Never thought about it."</i>

24:25.505 --> 24:26.798
<i>"Are you transphobic?"</i>

24:26.882 --> 24:29.092
<i>"I'll fuck her right now."</i>
<i>[chuckles nervously]</i>

24:29.176 --> 24:31.553
<i>"Whatever you want,</i>
<i>I'll do it. I'm sorry." Ah!</i>

24:32.095 --> 24:35.474
<i>White people used to be</i>
<i>laid-back, care-free, not a worry.</i>

24:35.557 --> 24:38.518
<i>Now every white guy is obsessed</i>
<i>with looking open-minded, progressive,</i>

24:38.602 --> 24:39.936
<i>it's taken over the identity.</i>

24:40.020 --> 24:42.564
<i>We used to have a devil and angel,</i>
<i>help us make decisions.</i>

24:42.647 --> 24:44.608
<i>Now we have a racist and an HR person.</i>

24:46.109 --> 24:49.237
<i>Like, "Black guy, African-American,</i>
<i>person of color, I love Lizzo."</i>

24:49.321 --> 24:51.531
<i>"Please take a photo with me.</i>
<i>Obama." [yells]</i>

24:53.825 --> 24:57.537
<i>It's embarrassing. Everybody thinks</i>
<i>white people have pride and supremacy.</i>

24:57.621 --> 24:58.455
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

24:58.538 --> 25:01.500
<i>Every white guy I know is on 23andMe</i>
<i>and ancestry.com going,</i>

25:01.583 --> 25:03.627
<i>"Come on, Native American. Come on!"</i>

25:03.710 --> 25:06.630
<i>"Latino, lesbian, something!" [exclaims]</i>

25:07.547 --> 25:10.091
<i>Have you noticed</i>
<i>how every white guy's gotta let you know</i>

25:10.175 --> 25:12.344
<i>he's a victim in some way?</i>
<i>A hook, an angle?</i>

25:12.427 --> 25:14.554
<i>You can't just be white anymore.</i>
<i>Gotta have a thing.</i>

25:14.638 --> 25:18.099
<i>"Sure. I'm white,</i>
<i>but I'm on the spectrum." [chuckles]</i>

25:19.059 --> 25:23.813
<i>"I have anxiety, I'm depressed,</i>
<i>my dad fucked me, I'm part Jew." Hey-ho!</i>

25:23.897 --> 25:25.941
<i>"One of the good ones." Huh? Ha!</i>

25:26.024 --> 25:26.983
<i>[dejectedly] Ah…</i>

25:27.734 --> 25:29.194
<i>We all have horrible thoughts.</i>

25:29.277 --> 25:32.072
<i>I don't care what color you are,</i>
<i>what race, religion.</i>

25:32.155 --> 25:34.157
<i>We're all trash. You know?</i>

25:34.241 --> 25:37.994
<i>We feel when we call someone else trash,</i>
<i>that we're better. "No, you're trash too."</i>

25:38.078 --> 25:40.747
<i>We all have sick, twisted thoughts.</i>
<i>We're full of shit.</i>

25:40.830 --> 25:42.999
<i>Nobody more full of shit</i>
<i>than the corporations.</i>

25:43.083 --> 25:45.210
<i>They act like they care about people now.</i>

25:45.293 --> 25:48.046
<i>They used to just want money,</i>
<i>now they're like, "No, we're good."</i>

25:48.129 --> 25:51.007
<i>Yeah. Nike's like,</i>
<i>"BLM! Keep stitching, Asian boy."</i>

25:51.091 --> 25:54.010
<i>Come on. Yeah!</i>
<i>They don't care about people.</i>

25:54.094 --> 25:57.430
<i>They'll put a rainbow sticker</i>
<i>on a Scud missile. "Inclusive."</i>

25:57.514 --> 25:58.557
<i>Yeah. We're good.</i>

25:59.474 --> 26:03.478
<i>Yeah. I saw Amazon tweeted</i>
<i>last week, "Racism is a virus."</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:05.939
<i>Don't say that. It gives racists an out.</i>

26:06.439 --> 26:09.651
<i>Right? "Sorry I said that shit, man.</i>
<i>I'm sick." Yeah.</i>

26:09.734 --> 26:12.821
<i>"Yeah. I've been diagnosed</i>
<i>with this virus called H1 N-word."</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:14.281
<i>"And, you know…"</i>

26:14.364 --> 26:18.660
<i>"I'll tell you, my white blood cells,</i>
<i>they are behind the times."</i>

26:20.620 --> 26:22.789
<i>Yeah. A lot of white guilt, you know?</i>

26:22.872 --> 26:25.417
<i>One of my friends, so guilty</i>
<i>he won't listen to hip-hop.</i>

26:25.500 --> 26:26.334
<i>Like, "Why not?"</i>

26:26.418 --> 26:28.878
<i>He's like, "It perpetuates</i>
<i>negative Black stereotypes."</i>

26:28.962 --> 26:31.506
<i>"What are you talking about?"</i>
<i>He's like, "Listen to the lyrics."</i>

26:31.590 --> 26:35.343
<i>"'All I care about is money. I run</i>
<i>everything. Look at all my diamonds.'"</i>

26:35.427 --> 26:38.471
<i>I was like, "If you ask me,</i>
<i>those sound like Jewish stereotypes."</i>

26:40.056 --> 26:42.726
<i>Hip-hop, surprisingly Jew-y. Right?</i>

26:42.809 --> 26:44.311
<i>Feels like a rapper's going,</i>

26:44.394 --> 26:47.147
<i>"I gotta write a new song.</i>
<i>Give me a Jewish stereotype."</i>

26:47.230 --> 26:50.400
<i>Uh, they control the weather.</i>
<i>"We're out here making it rain."</i>

26:50.483 --> 26:51.318
<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>-Hmm.</i>
<i>-[audience applauds]</i>

26:54.446 --> 26:55.363
<i>A-ha!</i>

26:56.156 --> 26:58.241
<i>I know. Tense stuff.</i>
<i>A Black guy yelled at me,</i>

26:58.325 --> 27:00.327
<i>"You're white.</i>
<i>What do you know about racism?"</i>

27:00.410 --> 27:02.078
<i>"I don't know if you read history books,</i>

27:02.162 --> 27:04.956
<i>but I think we're, like,</i>
<i>the best at it." [laughs]</i>

27:05.040 --> 27:07.000
<i>Pretty well-documented. You know.</i>

27:07.083 --> 27:08.877
<i>Monetized it. A lot of movies.</i>

27:11.921 --> 27:14.507
<i>I'm going dark</i>
<i>'cause we're all adults here.</i>

27:15.008 --> 27:18.011
<i>We're grown-ups. This is the best time</i>
<i>in history to be a grown-up.</i>

27:18.094 --> 27:19.387
<i>We can do whatever we want.</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:22.932
<i>Have you noticed grown-ups</i>
<i>are having a blast and kids are miserable?</i>

27:23.016 --> 27:24.434
<i>It's all completely flipped.</i>

27:24.517 --> 27:25.393
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

27:25.477 --> 27:28.647
<i>every grown-up was pissed off,</i>
<i>defeated, "Get off my lawn!"</i>

27:28.730 --> 27:29.981
<i>Now my friends are 42.</i>

27:30.065 --> 27:33.777
<i>All they do is play video games,</i>
<i>read comic books, and watch pro wrestling.</i>

27:34.361 --> 27:35.779
<i>And every teenager I see now</i>

27:35.862 --> 27:38.031
<i>is obsessed with politics</i>
<i>and on medication.</i>

27:39.324 --> 27:40.158
<i>We won.</i>

27:41.660 --> 27:43.203
<i>It's all flipped.</i>

27:43.286 --> 27:45.872
<i>Look, I'm 37.</i>
<i>By the time my dad was my age,</i>

27:45.955 --> 27:48.333
<i>he had two kids,</i>
<i>a law degree, and owned a home.</i>

27:48.416 --> 27:50.418

27:52.462 --> 27:53.755
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

27:55.298 --> 27:57.967
<i>I'll ask my friend,</i>
<i>"You're 44. You gonna start a family?"</i>

27:58.051 --> 28:01.846
<i>He's like, "What? I live with my mom.</i>
<i>I got a family." [laughs]</i>

28:01.930 --> 28:04.349
<i>"Now let's eat these edibles</i>
<i>and watch </i>The Avengers<i>."</i>

28:04.432 --> 28:07.852
<i>I'm like, "All right, let's do it."</i>
<i>That's adulthood now.</i>

28:08.353 --> 28:11.773
<i>Man, these kids are nice,</i>
<i>thoughtful, compassionate, smart,</i>

28:11.856 --> 28:13.274
<i>but they're not having any fun.</i>

28:13.358 --> 28:16.820
