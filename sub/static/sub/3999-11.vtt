00:18.952 --> 00:21.954
¶ Gingy, who did you harm? ¶

00:21.956 --> 00:25.157
¶ Gingy, who ate your arm? ¶

00:25.159 --> 00:26.959
GINGERBREAD MAN:
It was...

00:26.961 --> 00:29.294
Santa!

00:29.296 --> 00:30.496
(thunder rumbles)

00:30.498 --> 00:32.297
No!

00:32.299 --> 00:33.532
This is pretty dark.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.000
We will rescue you, Gingy!

00:35.002 --> 00:36.535
Wait till they get
to the North Pole

00:36.537 --> 00:39.471
to avenge his death
and take it way too far.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.907
¶ Santa's been a bad boy,
and that's not right ¶

00:41.909 --> 00:44.476
¶ The white-bearded devil's
gonna die tonight! ¶

00:44.478 --> 00:46.578
But I'm proud of that.
They worked really hard on it.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.580
(screaming)

00:48.582 --> 00:50.582
Do you want to visit
the prop closet?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.317
(screaming continues)

00:54.421 --> 00:56.422
(door opening)

00:57.924 --> 00:59.258
(Foster screams)

00:59.260 --> 01:01.360
Okay, just two more hours,

01:01.362 --> 01:03.996
and then it's ten days
down a wine bottle.

01:05.698 --> 01:06.932
(door opens, closes)
(giggles)

01:06.934 --> 01:08.600
Oh, my gosh.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.603
All this sneaking around, I feel
like gay guys in the '50s.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.939
I can't believe
you're going to London tonight.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.841
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.276
Come with me.
What?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.111
Spend Christmas
with my family in London.

01:19.113 --> 01:22.414
That's, like, skipping seven
relationship steps.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.616
What do you mean?
Do you really want
your whole family

01:24.618 --> 01:27.519
to meet the weird American girl
that you're making out with

01:27.521 --> 01:29.922
in a prop closet
who's also your boss?

01:29.924 --> 01:32.357
Yeah.
- Everything's been going
really, really well.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.792
What if I use the wrong fork?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.094
You won't use
the wrong fork,

01:35.096 --> 01:36.562
'cause I'll make sure

01:36.564 --> 01:37.696
that you-you don't.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.931
No, it'll be very casual.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.265
And I don't care
what they think,

01:40.267 --> 01:41.633
'cause I like you, and I want

01:41.635 --> 01:43.202
to spend Christmas
with you in London.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.204
I've never been to Europe. I...

01:45.206 --> 01:46.638
We'll stroll through Hyde Park,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.640
empty townhouses owned
by Russian billionaires.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.209
We're gonna go to Big Ben.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.977
I'll take on-on the wheel,
the Eye.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.378
We'll eat cheese on the wheel
and-and make out.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.148
Uh, we're gonna ride
black taxicabs even to places

01:56.150 --> 01:57.816
where we don't need to go
and we're not invited.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.285
Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

02:00.287 --> 02:01.720
(laughter)

02:03.590 --> 02:06.225
Okay, Alan.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.694
You did your best.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.803
Why did I agree to ride
to the airport with everyone?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.438
I'm an aspiring millionaire.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.240
I should be taking a Town Car,

02:21.242 --> 02:23.442
not packed six-deep
like a Hasidic family

02:23.444 --> 02:25.077
going to the bulk foods store.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.579
Relax, Schmidt,
we're all riding together

02:27.581 --> 02:28.947
so that we can hang out

02:28.949 --> 02:31.250
before we all go
to our magical destinations.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.118
Magical? I'm going back home
to Long Island,

02:33.120 --> 02:34.920
the birthplace
of the female crew cut.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.788
Yeah, and I'm going all the way
to New York because my mom

02:36.790 --> 02:39.091
wants to hand-deliver a
Christmas card to Matt Lauer,

02:39.093 --> 02:40.792
but you, Jess,

02:40.794 --> 02:41.960
you're going...

02:41.962 --> 02:43.495
BOTH:
To London!

02:43.497 --> 02:44.997
(in English accent):
'Ello, guvnor.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.765
You got to stop it
with that accent.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.767
Fancy a tickle?
Borderline racist.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.702
Check it out. I'm coming in hot
with gifts for the family.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.771
I'm ready for anything.
Is that a wallet necklace?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.606
Yeah, so I don't
get pickpocketed.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.775
Smart. Keep that money away
from them Gypsies.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.210
Are you nervous about
meeting his family?

02:58.212 --> 02:59.811
No, no. Yes.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.979
All right, here's the plan.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.481
We're at O'Hare at 8:00,

03:02.483 --> 03:05.150
O'Leary's at 9:00,
we're drunk by 6:00.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.119
See what I did there?
We're dinking on the plane.
(laughs)

03:07.121 --> 03:09.121
Man, I love Christmas Eve Eve
at O'Leary's.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.156
I always get laid. See, here,

03:11.158 --> 03:12.224
I'm a six, sixish.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.892
Uh, but I'm a Chicago ten.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.561
Yeah.
- I'm a six, man?
Maybe a little higher.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.895
Seven.
- But I'm... I'm a seven,
thank you.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.064
Plus Nick is dating Kai now,

03:19.066 --> 03:20.666
which means I'm getting
the butt.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.067
I'm getting all the butt.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.869
I made you guys some snack bags.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.070
Oh, thank you.
- Oh.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.305
You're like my mom,

03:26.307 --> 03:27.739
but in ways I can appreciate.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.209
Hey, Coach,
what's taking you so long?

03:30.211 --> 03:33.378
There he is.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.980
COACH: I know what
you're all thinking.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.548
You think I'm selfish
for going on vacation

03:36.550 --> 03:38.517
instead of going to Detroit
to see my family.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.252
Not thinking that;
very defensive.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.754
I live with a million people.
Four people.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.057
There are going to be a million
people at my mother's house.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.359
I need some me time.
And yes, I will be sad to miss

03:47.361 --> 03:49.528
my baby niece
and all of her Christmas joy,

03:49.530 --> 03:51.697
but I've made a decision
that I'm happy with,

03:51.699 --> 03:54.333
and it hasn't been giving me
stomach pains.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.601
You seem really great.
Yeah.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.669
I feel good.
Can we please go?!

03:57.671 --> 03:59.171
Yeah!
- Let's go to the airport!

03:59.173 --> 04:00.272
BOTH:
Christmas!

04:00.274 --> 04:01.673
(whooping)

04:07.780 --> 04:08.947
I'm getting in.
No, no, no, no.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.949
Too late.
- Okay.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.185
Oh, yeah.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.720
Loving the new Ford Fusion!

04:14.722 --> 04:16.521
You don't stink at all, man.
Nice.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.424
Are you wet?
- Just my bottom.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.859
Check out how roomy this is.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.527
You could open
a hat store in here.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.429
Why would I do that?
That tree's cool.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.232
What's it doing?
It coaches you to drive
more efficiently.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.767
Oh, look at that.
Your name is Coach. That's fun.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.435
I don't know why
that's fun to me, but it is.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.037
Pretty funny, I...

04:32.039 --> 04:34.273
Hey, Outside Dave,
will you take a holiday picture?

04:34.275 --> 04:35.907
Well, I'd prefer to paint you,

04:35.909 --> 04:38.110
but it appears time
is pressed against us.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.878
(groans)
(Schmidt cries out)

04:39.880 --> 04:40.912
All right.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.115
Let me get a good filter.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.283
Okay, now pretend

04:44.285 --> 04:45.751
you're really thirsty,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.719
but the only thing that
can quench your thirst

04:47.721 --> 04:50.255
is the tears
from a golden retriever. Go.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.090
Oh, that's good.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.992
Aaaaaand....

04:53.994 --> 04:55.327
got it.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.796
MAN (over P.A.):
Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.598
(announcement continues
indistinctly)

04:59.600 --> 05:02.067
¶ I don't know
where Santa goes ¶

05:02.069 --> 05:05.170
¶ 11 months of the year ¶

05:05.172 --> 05:07.439
¶ I just know I love you so ¶
(loud clamoring)

05:07.441 --> 05:10.242
¶ And Christmastime is here ¶

05:10.244 --> 05:12.744
¶ It's cold outside... ¶
Excuse me, what's going on?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.913
Midwest storm.
Everything's delayed.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.248
God have mercy on us all.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.183
Ow! Ow!

05:18.185 --> 05:20.018
Move, white bitch!

05:25.124 --> 05:26.291
(beeping)

05:26.293 --> 05:28.360
Ryan, hi. (sighs)

05:28.362 --> 05:30.128
My flight's delayed.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.664
Please tell your parents
this is not like me.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.965
I am never late.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.934
On time or naked is what
I always say.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.336
I've never said that. (chuckles)

05:37.338 --> 05:39.671
I'll be fully clothed, but late.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.306
I'll talk to you later.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.342
Okay, I got this.
Coach, your flight's okay.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.010
Thanks, Jess.
I'm going to go find

05:45.012 --> 05:47.946
a charging station so I can, uh,
call my niece before Hawaii.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.816
Everyone stop looking at me!

05:50.818 --> 05:52.984
Cece and Schmidt,
you're on the red-eye.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.786
The red-eye? What do
I look like, a 24-year-old

05:54.788 --> 05:56.988
who's too afraid to break up
with his college girlfriend?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.124
I mean, thank you for this.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.293
Nick and Winston,
I got you guys.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.494
Next.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.696
Hi.
Hi.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.466
First and foremost, I'd like to
wish you a very merry Christmas.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.534
Next.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.303
Uh, right. (chuckles)

06:11.305 --> 06:13.638
Um, my friends are trying
to get on the Chicago flight.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.507
Uh, Winston Bishop
and Nick Miller.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.342
Yeah, standby,
tenth and 11th on the list.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.010
I really appreciate that,

06:19.012 --> 06:20.178
but...

06:20.180 --> 06:22.414
is there any way
you could get...

06:22.416 --> 06:24.249
Nope.
And now they're 12th and 13th.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.318
I'm sorry. I was...

06:26.320 --> 06:28.487
Don't apologize. 14, 15.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.088
I didn't apologize.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.056
16, 17.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.858
Sir.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.326
You seem like
a reasonable person.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.894
I'm not and you're at 18 and 19.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.262
Okay... You know what?
(blows raspberry)

06:37.264 --> 06:38.764
You want mean,
I'll give you mean.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.665
I hope your mom falls
down the stairs

06:40.667 --> 06:42.367
and she hurts parts of herself.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.770
I hate my mom.
Back to 16 and 17.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.038
Thank you.
- Don't thank me. 18, 19.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.340
It's Christmas.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.208
Oh, I didn't know that.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.411
I thought they just did a black
version of<i> Annie</i> for no reason.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.678
20, 21.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.780
You...
- 22, 23.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.014
But...
- 24, 25.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.449
Sir.
- They're on the wing, dear.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.118
Next?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.554
No. Next?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.189
(loud clamoring)
WOMAN: Stop pushing.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.526
MAN (over P.A.):
Flight 202 to Dallas-
Fort Worth cancelled.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.361
(groans)

07:09.363 --> 07:10.862
Hey, let's wait
in the first-class lounge,

07:10.864 --> 07:12.531
like the other
HBO GO subscribers.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.599
You're a member?
- Cece, I grew up
on the mean streets

07:14.601 --> 07:18.303
of Long Island, just gazing up
at the Manhattan city skyline,

07:18.305 --> 07:20.405
thinking, "You know what,
one day, I'm gonna get there."

07:20.407 --> 07:23.141
That first-class lounge
is my Manhattan.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.110
"Greatest discovery of all time

07:25.112 --> 07:27.112
"is that a person can change
his future

07:27.114 --> 07:30.649
by merely changing
his attitude."

07:30.651 --> 07:32.484
Oprah Winfrey.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.155
Sir, may I help you?
Are you a member?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.790
I just had
an incredible layover.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.792
Flew in from Istanbul. I just
need to lay down for a while.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.261
I'm a little... Okay?
Certainly. Uh, do you have

07:43.263 --> 07:44.930
a first-class ticket
or a membership card?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.298
Do I have a...
a membership card?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.466
Let me ask you something.
I tend to, uh...

07:47.468 --> 07:48.900
tend to deal with, uh,

07:48.902 --> 07:50.268
Sarah Beth.
- I'm not aware of
a Sarah Beth, sir.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.603
The last time
I talked to her,

07:51.605 --> 07:53.071
she was suffering
from the diabetes.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.473
Is she still on the inhaler?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.774
Uh...
- Did she pass?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.442
She passed, didn't she?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.110
I'm afraid I...
I'm gonna need a minute.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.612
I'm just gonna go inside,
sit down, just kind of take...

08:00.614 --> 08:02.747
Are you a member, sir?
Am I a mem...?

08:02.749 --> 08:04.583
Can we just get
two guest passes, please?

08:04.585 --> 08:06.117
Of course.
- Thank you.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.919
That's a real thing--
guest passes?

08:07.921 --> 08:08.920
Yes, sir.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.789
Okay. It's a debit card.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.757
Is Ro-Ro done yet? Damn.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.260
Okay, uh, have her call me,
but m-my phone's about to d...

08:15.262 --> 08:16.461
(beeping)

08:16.463 --> 08:18.263
My ph... Hello?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.831
Damn it.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.100
Really?
Phone and a laptop?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.134
You're playing solitaire?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.769
Is that a keyboard?

08:24.771 --> 08:26.771
Dude, come on!

08:26.773 --> 08:28.940
Why we should've
taken trains.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.275
The sky's too fickle.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.110
It's the play place
for butterflies.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.445
JESS:
"Can't wait to see you.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.679
House at the end of the lane"?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.615
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.485
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What?

08:40.487 --> 08:42.320
This is where Ryan lives.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.055
Whoa!
What?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.123
It's a gorgeous mansion.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.125
He said it was casual.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.895
Does "casual" mean something
very different in England?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.797
Like... like "we own England"?

08:52.799 --> 08:54.332
That's some McDuck money!

08:54.334 --> 08:56.535
That's "do whatever I want"
money.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.004
Exactly.
You better learn how
to ride a polo horse.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.805
It's actually a polio horse.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.874
Uh, originally they were bred
as helper horses

09:02.876 --> 09:05.010
for people with polio,
but I don't think anything

09:05.012 --> 09:06.978
of what I just said
was correct, so...

09:06.980 --> 09:09.481
What is...?
Are you all right?

09:09.483 --> 09:10.749
Hey. My flight's delayed.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.350
Might not even meet
his very rich family.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.053
Anyway, you guys should go
to your-your gate.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.857
Get out of here,
you Christmas... packages.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.092
All right. Merry Christmas.
Okay. All right,
let's... Yeah.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.594
Okay. Yeah.
- All of that
good stuff.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.396
See you later.
Safe travels.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.597
(cell phone chiming)

09:25.599 --> 09:26.965
(sighs)

09:28.601 --> 09:30.535
(cell phone chimes)

09:30.537 --> 09:34.005
Is that a falcon
wearing a necklace?

09:38.844 --> 09:40.111
Can I help you?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.546
Sir...

09:41.548 --> 09:43.515
I'd like the strongest
drink you have,

09:43.517 --> 09:45.584
and also a wine spritzer
on the side

09:45.586 --> 09:47.919
in case I don't like it.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.588
(mouths):
Thank you.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.957
MAN:
Looks like somebody's
not so merry.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.694
Come on.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.928
Are you...?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.930
(chuckles softly)

09:58.932 --> 10:00.765
Okay, um... that's silly.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.534
I really want this to be true.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.436
What seems to be troubling you?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.738
I just found out that my
boyfriend is... is really rich,

10:06.740 --> 10:08.873
and there's no way his parents
are gonna like me,

10:08.875 --> 10:10.609
and he's...
Well, have you ever

10:10.611 --> 10:12.444
thought that the world
is just full of sloths,

10:12.446 --> 10:14.546
and then one day,
this beautiful lion walks in?

10:14.548 --> 10:16.715
Actually, you've probably never
thought that way, Santa.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.717
Can I just go ahead
and call you Santa?

10:18.719 --> 10:21.286
Anyway, should I just
bail on this trip?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.288
Hmm, sounds complicated.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.723
Yeah.
- Why don't you

10:24.725 --> 10:26.424
come with me
to the family bathroom,

10:26.426 --> 10:28.760
sit on my lap,
and I'll give you

10:28.762 --> 10:31.096
the sleigh ride
you'll never forget?

10:31.098 --> 10:32.497
What? Santa!

10:32.499 --> 10:33.765
North Pole.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.166
Player for life.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.668
Get out of here!

10:36.670 --> 10:39.437
Pervert Santa!
No cookies for you here,

10:39.439 --> 10:40.739
you white-bearded freak!

10:40.741 --> 10:42.741
Well, well, well.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.943
If it isn't ol' Bangs LaRue.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.445
Don't test me, sweetie. I'll put
your head in a trash can.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.680
Wow.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.948
(chuckles)

10:49.950 --> 10:53.118
You and I are gonna drink.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.854
Wow, this place
is just so amazing.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.255
You got to feel this pillow.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.957
Look at this thing.
This is the pillow

10:58.959 --> 11:01.192
that all the other pillows
want to have sex with.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.796
Nice.
Look at that guy.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.265
Bet he's the kind of guy who
takes one bite of lobster

11:07.267 --> 11:09.267
and just throws the rest
of it in the trash.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.835
I'd love to do that-- just once.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.337
Stupid trash lobster.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.607
He's coming over.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.608
Hello, sir.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.109
First time in the lounge?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.477
(chuckling):
Uh...

11:19.479 --> 11:20.945
What's that, now?

11:20.947 --> 11:23.114
Come on.
Why would you say that?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.616
Because of all
the pillow squeezing.

11:24.618 --> 11:25.650
I get it.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.218
I get it. I was like you once.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.287
Where are you from?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.455
I'm from New York.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.623
Uh, Manhattan, of course.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.025
Mainly the money
and museum district.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.026
I can see the
Central Park horses

11:35.028 --> 11:36.828
defecating from my window.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.763
(chuckles)
That's funny. So can I.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.499
Robert Goodwin.
- All right.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.667
Schmidt.
- Mind if I sit?

11:42.669 --> 11:45.070
Please, go ahead.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.471
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Due to increased security,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.073
please have your
picture ID ready.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.741
All right,
here's what we got to do.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.077
We got to convince
a bunch of people not to fly,

11:52.079 --> 11:54.079
and then we're at
the top of the list.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.747
It's foolproof--
unless it doesn't work.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.516
Then it didn't work,
so I think we got

11:58.518 --> 12:01.419
a 50-50 chance to do it,
so let's do it.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.421
(both laughing)

12:03.423 --> 12:04.989
Wait.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.424
Ah, yeah, yeah.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.926
Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.

12:07.928 --> 12:08.927
What's up, boys?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.261
Those are the guys

12:10.263 --> 12:12.097
I was just drinking
with at the bar.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.665
Are you sure you guys

12:13.667 --> 12:15.033
can fly a plane?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.701
I'm sure it's
not a big deal.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.837
I bet the weed will
offset the booze.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.772
Ah, hey there, precious.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.107
Yeah, you're quiet now,

12:22.109 --> 12:23.575
but when that
air pressure hits you,

12:23.577 --> 12:24.743
you're gonna be screaming

12:24.745 --> 12:26.044
like a cat
in the dishwasher.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.545
And I won't stop you.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.214
This could be it, so...

12:29.216 --> 12:31.716
if we all die on this
plane, was it worth it?

12:31.718 --> 12:33.685
I say yeah, let's
get to Chicago.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.020
Who cares?
It's snowing there.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.622
(yells in pain)
You gonna bite me?

12:37.624 --> 12:40.125
When we get on the plane,
I'm gonna bite you back.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.793
Breast-feeding is a...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.895
very sensitive subject for me.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.597
I can help
who's next. Sir?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.632
Uh, sir, he doesn't work here.
Oh, yes, I do.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.768
Uh, no, you...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your flight's been canceled.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.102
The flight has not
been canceled.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.537
Flight's been canceled.
- Security!

12:52.539 --> 12:54.239
Security! Please get
this woman out of here!

12:54.241 --> 12:56.241
Please get this man...
She's wearing
a fake outfit.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.776
You know what? I don't know...

12:57.778 --> 12:59.811
Debbie, don't start with me.
You're in a mood.
Oh...

12:59.813 --> 13:01.646
And then he sent me this text.

13:01.648 --> 13:02.647
Oh, my God.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.582
Where's Anna
and Mr. Bates?

13:04.584 --> 13:05.884
Do you watch<i> Downton?</i>
- Yeah.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.719
I know it's a soap opera,
but I like it.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.154
JESS:
It's not even about the money.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.889
That's big.
It's like every new piece

13:10.891 --> 13:12.223
of information I get about him

13:12.225 --> 13:13.792
just makes him more
and more out of my league.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.326
Mm.
- He'll be nice
about it,

13:15.328 --> 13:16.795
but the moment I get there,

13:16.797 --> 13:18.963
everybody will know
I don't belong there.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.899
Am I being dumb?
- No.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.600
Did I ever tell you
about that time

13:22.602 --> 13:24.235
I met my ex-boyfriend's
family over the holidays?

13:24.237 --> 13:25.770
I've known you for 20 minutes.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.972
Well, it was worse than
the last season of<i> Scrubs.</i>

13:27.974 --> 13:29.774
A teaching hospital? Come on!

13:29.776 --> 13:33.077
People think Christmas is
gonna be like<i> Love Actually</i>

13:33.079 --> 13:35.747
and "God Only Knows"
is gonna play

13:35.749 --> 13:39.117
over their happy
ending, but it won't.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.451
Do what I do.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.453
Hide out with a pizza

13:42.455 --> 13:44.622
and save the big issues
for the New Year.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.158
Oh, God.
- Don't judge me
for eating pizza!

13:47.160 --> 13:48.626
No. My presents are gone.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.628
What?
- Santa stole my presents.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.630
He was a reverse Santa.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.865
"Reverse Santa"?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.433
What am I gonna do now?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.035
You can't go now.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.938
You're right.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.840
I can't.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.214
God, I'm drunk at work.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.949
Sis?
Hello.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.784
Hey. Let me talk to Ro-Ro.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.719
Hmm-mm. I'm not trying
to make you feel better

14:14.721 --> 14:16.387
about lying naked on the beach

14:16.389 --> 14:18.723
sipping some nonsense
instead of seeing your family.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.158
And are you using the cuteness
of your daughter

14:20.160 --> 14:21.326
to blackmail me
to come to Christmas?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.795
Am I?
Yeah, I am, actually.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.330
Ro-Ro, it's your Uncle Ernie!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.031
If you can hear me,
get your mom's hair wet,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.666
then get on the phone
while she's freaking out!

14:28.668 --> 14:31.536
You want to speak to your niece,
you know where she is.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.072
(groans)
(dial tone drones)

14:34.074 --> 14:35.240
SCHMIDT:
Diversification.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.474
That's what it's all about.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.642
You know, I keep
telling Nick that,

14:37.644 --> 14:38.843
but he won't
listen to me.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.178
Hey, man to man.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.412
Anything. What?

14:41.414 --> 14:44.716
I'd love to take a run
at your girl.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.317
(chuckles)
Excuse me?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.519
Now, don't tell me
you're exclusive.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.321
Successful men
like us,

14:50.323 --> 14:52.991
we don't order
just one item off the menu.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.659
I'll tell you what.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.162
You do this for me,

14:58.164 --> 15:00.598
and I'll do this
for you.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.833
Gold Select.

15:01.835 --> 15:05.937
Gets you into any airport club
in the world...

15:05.939 --> 15:07.672
minus New Zealand.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.340
What's going on guys?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.341
Closing some deals?

15:10.343 --> 15:11.542
Well, actually...

15:11.544 --> 15:13.611
No... we are not.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.181
You know what they call you
where I'm from?

15:17.183 --> 15:18.583
A dirty old bitch.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.218
Dirty old "biatch."

15:20.220 --> 15:21.886
"Biatch," just
in general.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.588
'Cause I ain't
from Manhattan, sir.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.757
I'm from Long Island.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.726
5-1-6, up in your lounge, sucka.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.229
You better calm down, or you're
gonna be kicked out of the...

15:31.231 --> 15:32.563
Good, I don't want to
be in this lounge,

15:32.565 --> 15:34.098
I don't want to be in any club
that you're a part of.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.566
Okay, am I missing something?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.936
I don't want to be
in any lounge or club

15:37.938 --> 15:39.370
that you're a part of, sir.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.572
You dirty old bitch,
for good measure.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.276
'Cause I'm from Long Island,
I'll take the railroad-- LIRR.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.544
You're embarrassing yourself.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.879
SCHMIDT: New York,
Long Island.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.614
Billy Joel.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.049
Cece, let's roll.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.116
Okay.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.621
Nassau County.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.423
Billy Joel, one more time.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.425
"Piano Man."

16:00.427 --> 16:01.826
"Goodnight Saigon."

16:01.828 --> 16:03.261
That's a sad one.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.430
Cry about that,
you dirty old bitch.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.766
So they go to this bar in
Chicago to get Winston laid...

16:08.768 --> 16:11.402
And one of these
guys is your ex?
- Yeah, Nick.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.171
Mm, the nicest thing
I ever did for an ex

16:13.173 --> 16:14.605
is give him a ride
to the airport.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.074
And for me, that's
just going to work,

16:16.076 --> 16:17.108
and I still
barely did it.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.943
(laughs)

16:18.945 --> 16:21.646
Okay, please don't take this
as a Christmas miracle.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.648
But what can
I do to help?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.484
Do you want to fly first-class
somewhere, like Pittsburgh?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.453
And then tell everyone
you're a Latin pop star?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.823
I did that once, and it's
kind of the perfect Christmas.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.391
You can pass as Latin.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.495
Actually, you know
what I'd love?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.297
Hope first class is okay.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.499
And don't freak out, but I think
Paul Dano's on your flight.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.101
And don't thank me, thank her.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.669
But thank me also,
because I'm the one that did it.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.770
Wow, this is really amazing.

16:45.772 --> 16:46.771
Thank you, guys.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.673
Don't thank us, go.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.775
Call me if you want
to hang out this week.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.443
I was thinking about
going to the mountains

16:52.445 --> 16:54.112
and crying at some point,
but that's flexible.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.346
All right,
I got to bounce

16:55.348 --> 16:57.015
before these people I bumped
come after me.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.783
Don't worry,
they deserve it.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.451
I'm being bumped?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.520
You're an idiot,
I'm Gold Select.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.922
Check it out.

17:13.332 --> 17:14.966
Come on, just tell
me what he said.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.300
Without going
into specifics,

17:16.302 --> 17:17.802
he disrespected something
more important to me

17:17.804 --> 17:18.903
than any stupid
lounge.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.405
Daniel Craig's
tailoring?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.373
No.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.975
Something priceless.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.344
Hey.
What?

17:26.346 --> 17:27.512
I stole you something.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.980
Bam!

17:28.982 --> 17:31.983
You sneaky
Indian mouse.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.317
(giggling)

17:33.319 --> 17:34.419
I'm in my own
lounge now.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.987
(laughs)

17:38.490 --> 17:40.525
Look, I know this is
kind of dumb to say,

17:40.527 --> 17:42.293
but I really like
being your friend.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.234
My friend.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.605
I like being
your friend, too.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.808
Yeah.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.410
Merry Christmas, Schmidt.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.746
Merry Christmas, Cecilia.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.683
(sighs)

18:05.685 --> 18:07.585
Is it crazy that I'm
considering going to Detroit

18:07.587 --> 18:08.719
instead of Hawaii?

18:08.721 --> 18:09.754
Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.955
Yeah, I thought that.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.790
Ooh, this is
a fancy seat.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.258
Reminds me of the seat
my grandmother used

18:14.260 --> 18:15.726
to ride up and down
the stairs in.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.562
Hey, Jess.
Damn thing was comfortable.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.730
Thank you,
first class is amazing.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.066
(sniffs) Smells like
rich people. (chuckles)

18:22.068 --> 18:23.434
I'm so glad.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.570
These are nice.
Hey, where are you?
Did you board?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.905
Um, yeah, I'm on the plane,
I'm sitting in my seat.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.241
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to Los
Angeles International Airport.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.777
Wait, w... Jess, what was that?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.645
Uh, they're telling me
to turn off my phone.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.947
Uh, we're taking off now.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.415
Jess, hold on, hold on,
hold on, J...

18:37.417 --> 18:38.616
How do you change this...?

18:38.618 --> 18:39.817
How do you change this thing?!

18:39.819 --> 18:41.085
To the hits?

18:41.087 --> 18:42.120
I don't know, like top 40?

18:42.122 --> 18:43.788
Jess, what's going on?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.057
I'm not going.

18:46.059 --> 18:47.425
Are you kidding me?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.426
You saw the house.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.760
It's too much pressure.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.762
Je...
And Santa stole my gifts.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.064
Wait, Santa did what?

18:53.066 --> 18:54.932
What if I do something wrong
and...

18:54.934 --> 18:57.268
and I lose Ryan?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.436
So, what are you gonna do?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.971
You're gonna spend
Christmas alone?

18:59.973 --> 19:01.472
Sir?
- Yeah.
- We're about
to take off.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.907
We need you
to turn off your phone.
I understand.

19:02.909 --> 19:03.774
I just need one minute.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.943
It's gonna be fine,
don't worry.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.145
I mean, it's cra...
- Sir?

19:07.147 --> 19:09.080
Now, sir.
I'm trying
to figure something out.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.948
If she's not getting
on a plane.
- Hey, Nick!

19:10.950 --> 19:12.283
This is first class!

19:12.285 --> 19:14.085
Act like you've
been somewhere before!

19:14.087 --> 19:15.486
Merry Christmas, Nick.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.854
Jess, hey!
Sir.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.859
(whistling)

19:25.831 --> 19:27.965
NICK:
Jess.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.800
You're not spending
Christmas alone.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.435
Oh, no.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.937
You're going to England.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.272
What are you guys doing?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.540
Hey, you think
you're gonna lose Ryan

19:35.542 --> 19:37.208
'cause you're not good enough
for his stupid family?

19:37.210 --> 19:40.645
Has he ever had five people get
off planes for him?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.880
I-I hadn't gotten
on mine, yet.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.782
T-To be fair, we were
in the food court,

19:44.784 --> 19:46.450
but it's beautiful,
keep going, Nick.
- Look, Jess,

19:46.452 --> 19:48.719
we're not getting on our flights
unless you get on yours.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.988
Airport chicken,
that's right.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.390
You want to take down
everyone's Christmases?

19:52.392 --> 19:54.625
WINSTON:
Don't be that person.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.562
You got to go to England,
and you have to just try.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.631
Go to England,
Jess, it's worth it.

20:00.633 --> 20:04.569
But my flight's boarding,
and I don't have any gifts,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.470
and there's no way
I'm gonna make it.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.972
Oh, no, you are gonna
make it, come on.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.040
Yeah.
All right, let's go!

20:11.043 --> 20:12.677
JESS:
This doesn't seem great.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.078
Okay, you know what,
let's go, let's go.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.313
Let's just,
let's just run.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.148
Come on, let's go.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.516
(speaks indistinctly)

20:18.518 --> 20:19.784
Let's go.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.555
So, I guess this is good-bye.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.257
(yelling for Jess to leave)

20:29.595 --> 20:31.195
I don't care if there's no time.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.396
I love you guys.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.365
Ah, come on.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.600
Get out of here!

20:35.602 --> 20:37.001
Love doesn't matter!

20:37.003 --> 20:39.370
Merry Christmas.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.905
Bye.

20:42.174 --> 20:46.077
¶ God only knows
what I'd be without you ¶

20:50.349 --> 20:52.416
¶ If you should ever leave me ¶

20:52.418 --> 20:54.685
Give me a little space.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.855
¶ Though life would
still go on, believe me ¶

20:57.857 --> 21:00.191
¶ The world would show
nothing to me ¶

21:00.193 --> 21:01.592
Ugh!

21:01.594 --> 21:03.394
Light a match.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.596
¶ So what good would
living do me ¶
Cece, watch.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.531
¶ God only knows ¶
Oh, my God.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.301
¶ What I'd be without you ¶
Got him.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.536
¶ God only knows ¶
Hi, Ro-Ro.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.538
Uncle Ernie!

21:14.540 --> 21:17.742
¶ God only knows
what I'd be without you ¶

21:17.744 --> 21:20.711
¶ God only knows what
I'd be without you ¶

21:20.713 --> 21:22.780
¶ God only knows ¶

21:22.782 --> 21:26.817
¶ God only knows
what I'd be without you ¶

21:26.819 --> 21:28.886
¶ God only knows what
I'd be without you ¶

21:28.888 --> 21:30.788
¶ God only knows ¶

21:30.790 --> 21:34.759
¶ God only knows
what I'd be without you ¶

21:34.761 --> 21:36.761
¶ God only knows what
I'd be without you ¶

21:36.763 --> 21:38.596
¶ God only knows. ¶

21:38.598 --> 21:40.631
Hey, I'm here. Are you here?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.600
RYAN: I'm here.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.502
I got your text, so I came back
to surprise you.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.838
I'm outside your loft.
Where are you?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.308
Oh, no. No!

21:50.310 --> 21:53.010
I'm in London.
Stay where you are,
I'll be there in 17 hours.
