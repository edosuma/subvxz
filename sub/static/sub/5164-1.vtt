00:01.460 --> 00:02.585
Hey, man, fuck that!

00:02.878 --> 00:06.089
Them niggas around the corner
tripped out, man.

00:06.298 --> 00:09.425
- Fuck that shit, man!
- Let's go. I'll take my car.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.887
Oh, fuck that. We should've
let these niggas have it.

00:13.097 --> 00:16.599
- Just pull up, just pull up.
- Get your shit ready, nigga.

00:16.809 --> 00:17.975
Damn!

00:18.936 --> 00:20.103
These niggas here?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.814
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.

00:24.775 --> 00:27.777
Look out, nigga! What's up, punk?!

00:36.829 --> 00:39.372
Possible 187 at corner of
Crenshaw and Century.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.626
They shot my brother!

01:09.862 --> 01:12.280
- Tre, you do your homework?
- What homework?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.490
- Yeah, I did it.
- Can I copy it?

01:14.783 --> 01:17.660
Hell, no. Too bad,
you should've done it.

01:17.828 --> 01:21.956
- Did you hear the shooting last night?
- Yeah, I got under my bed.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.833
Man, you a scaredy-cat.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.295
My mama say, "A bullet
don't have no name on it."

01:27.504 --> 01:30.798
I ain't afraid. My brothers
been shot and they still alive.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.675
They lucky.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.345
Y'all want to see something?

01:37.139 --> 01:38.473
What?

01:38.682 --> 01:41.058
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.359
Is that blood?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.735
What happened?

02:33.028 --> 02:36.614
Somebody got smoked.
Look at the hole in the wall, stupid.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.909
Least I can tell my times tables.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.745
Look! Why is the blood
turning yellow?

02:43.038 --> 02:46.249
That's what happens when it
separates from the plasma.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.919
So that's how the settlers
survived that long hard winter...

02:50.212 --> 02:53.965
...that took so many of their lives,
is by eating foods...

02:54.216 --> 02:59.345
...that were given to them,
like the turkey and the squash...

02:59.847 --> 03:04.767
...and all the foods that we think of
as our traditional holiday meal.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.437
And that's why we celebrate
Thanksgiving...

03:08.647 --> 03:11.649
...to commemorate the unity
between the Indians...

03:12.609 --> 03:13.609
Excuse me...

03:13.902 --> 03:15.903
...the Native Americans.

03:16.113 --> 03:20.783
- And the early English settlers
who were called... Class?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.785
Pilgrims.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.288
That's right, the Pilgrims.
Very good.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.789
The penguins!

03:28.917 --> 03:30.459
Who said that?

03:31.253 --> 03:34.005
- Mr. Styles.
- That's me.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.091
How is it you always have
something funny to say?

03:37.301 --> 03:39.010
Because I'm a comedian.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.639
Would you like to come up
and teach the class?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.018
Yeah, I can do that.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.896
Very well, come on up. Instruct us.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.822
- What's the basis of your lecture?
- What?

04:00.324 --> 04:02.491
What are you going to talk about?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.952
I'd tell you if you let me talk.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.502
- What's the name of this place?
- That's Africa. I know that.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.171
Right, that's Africa.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.175
Did you know that Africa is where
the body of the first man was found?

04:19.468 --> 04:22.219
My daddy says that's where
all people originated from.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.723
That means everybody's really
from Africa. Everybody.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.225
All y'all. Everybody.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.562
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from Crenshaw Mafia!

04:34.858 --> 04:36.817
Like it or not, you from Africa.

04:37.027 --> 04:41.322
I ain't from Africa. You from Africa.
You African booty-scratcher!

04:42.491 --> 04:43.532
Quiet.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.368
Punk, I'll kick your ass.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.245
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.206
I'll get my brother to shoot you!

04:50.582 --> 04:54.377
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy. Least I got one.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.546
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!

04:57.714 --> 05:01.217
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now! That's enough!

05:04.012 --> 05:09.100
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.227
It's just that...

05:11.520 --> 05:12.895
Yes, go on.

05:13.188 --> 05:16.357
It's just that he has
a very bad temper.

05:16.566 --> 05:21.070
It's extremely difficult for him
to interact with the other children.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.740
Perhaps I could recommend therapy
or a child psychologist.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.576
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.

05:27.786 --> 05:31.872
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?

05:32.374 --> 05:34.583
That's none of your business...

05:34.876 --> 05:37.920
...but I am employed, and I'm studying
for my master's degree.

05:38.130 --> 05:42.091
- Then you are educated.
- We gonna talk about me or my son?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.926
I'm sorry.

05:44.636 --> 05:48.264
Well, we'll be happy to see Tre
back in class on Tuesday.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.267
His suspension was only
for three days, you know.

05:51.435 --> 05:55.104
- No. You won't be seeing Tre again.
- And why is that, may I ask?

05:55.397 --> 05:59.233
- Tre is going to live with his father.
- His father?

05:59.443 --> 06:04.613
Yes, his father. Or did you think
we made babies by ourselves?

06:06.658 --> 06:10.453
- You tell her go jump in the lake?
- What was our agreement?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.955
What did we put down in writing?

06:17.294 --> 06:20.254
"I, Tre Styles,
being of sound mind and body...

06:20.464 --> 06:23.591
...agree not to get into any disputes,
physical or verbal...

06:23.800 --> 06:27.970
...for the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this...

06:28.180 --> 06:33.309
...I will go to live with my father,
Mr. Furious Styles."

06:33.643 --> 06:36.812
"Signed..."
Oh, now, who wrote this?

06:38.440 --> 06:41.108
"Tre Styles."

06:43.653 --> 06:46.489
You have to work on
your handwriting.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.962
Bean pies. World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.219
I just don't want to
see you end up dead.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.012
Or in jail.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.683
A drunk, standing in front
of one of these liquor stores.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.102
Can you understand?

07:20.732 --> 07:23.025
Look at me. I'm serious.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.487
I love you.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.030
You're my only son.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.191
How you doing?

08:04.359 --> 08:08.696
- I'm fine. How about yourself?
- I'm living. That's enough for me.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.242
Well, here he is.

08:18.039 --> 08:22.042
- What's the matter? You can't say hi?
- Hi, Daddy.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.589
Go ahead, talk to your friends.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.265
- What's up, Tre?
- What's up, Doughboy?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.604
Well, there goes your son.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.443
You wanted him, you got him.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.822
Why you trying to make this
so easy?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.242
Well, it's like you told me:

08:56.620 --> 08:58.954
I can't teach him how to be a man.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.832
That's your job.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.296
So it ain't no weekly thing
no more, huh?

09:07.505 --> 09:09.131
You staying for good?

09:09.841 --> 09:13.260
Chris, you know Tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?

09:13.470 --> 09:16.722
Yeah. You the one collect
all those comic books.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.515
You living here now?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.312
Thank you, Reva.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.023
Furious.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.947
- Take care of my baby.
- He is my baby too.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.158
You still collect comics?

09:37.786 --> 09:40.329
This fool got more comics
than a motherfucker.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.540
- Tre, come here.
- Watch my stuff.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.837
What up, Tre?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.673
What's up, Rick?

09:52.342 --> 09:56.303
Well, it looks like you got
all your friends over here.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.849
When you coming to pick me up?

10:04.062 --> 10:05.145
Listen...

10:06.022 --> 10:08.190
...this is just a temporary thing.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.361
When I get out of school, I'll get
a better job, a better place to stay.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.697
Maybe a house?

10:14.906 --> 10:18.909
Then you can come back,
and things will be better. Okay?

10:19.577 --> 10:20.869
Okay, Mom.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.039
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.670
- Love you, love you.
- Me too. Bye, Mommy.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.340
- Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
- I ain't got no troubles.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.718
- You got some troubles?
- Lawn trouble.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.554
- Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
- How much?

10:38.722 --> 10:41.932
I'll give you $5
for the whole lawn.

10:42.225 --> 10:45.352
Five dollars. Man, that ain't shit.

10:45.562 --> 10:49.231
- I can make more doing nothing.
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.191
He work for his uncle.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.070
That's too bad. I guess I just
have to get my son to do it for me.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.447
Do what?

10:56.740 --> 10:59.450
Want you to rake up these leaves
off the lawn.

11:00.201 --> 11:04.455
Boy, don't look at me funny if I
ask you to do something. Take this.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.919
There's two trash bags right there
on the ground. See y'all later.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.719
Damn, your daddy mean. He's worse
than the bogeyman himself.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.848
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, Kunta Kinte?

11:23.058 --> 11:25.559
- Later, Tre.
- Later.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.772
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.648
Shut up, fool. Yeah, there is.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.735
If there is, I'll bet you Hulk
could whip his ass.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.655
Yeah, later.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.735
Tre, I gotta lay down
the rules of the house.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.654
Same thing as weekends,
you remember?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.492
All right, what are they?

12:23.660 --> 12:27.788
Clean the bathroom sink,
floor and tub.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.832
I gotta clean that tub?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.208
Yeah.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.506
Clean my room and water the lawn.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.634
Dad, can I ask you something?

12:40.844 --> 12:43.345
What do you have to do
around here?

12:48.184 --> 12:52.521
I don't have to do nothing around here
except for pay the bills...

12:52.730 --> 12:56.942
...put food on the table and put clothes
on your back, you understand?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.570
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.366
You may think I'm being hard
on you right now, but I'm not.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.744
I'm trying to teach you
how to be responsible.

13:08.037 --> 13:12.708
Your friends across the street,
they don't have anybody to show them.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.210
You gonna see how they end up too.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.342
I'm glad you're here, Tre.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.679
You're a prince, you know that?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.973
Yeah. You're the prince...

13:28.558 --> 13:30.058
...I'm the king.

13:31.186 --> 13:35.022
Right now, the king says it's time
for the prince to go to bed.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.691
So get yourself together.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.068
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

14:46.302 --> 14:47.427
Oh, shit!

15:24.716 --> 15:26.842
Somebody must've prayed
for that fool.

15:27.135 --> 15:31.013
- I swear I aimed right for his head.
- Should've blew it off.

15:31.306 --> 15:35.809
Don't say that.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.147
It'd be contributing to killing
another brother.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.531
Man, where are these fools?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.995
We've been waiting out here
for almost an hour.

16:14.057 --> 16:18.185
- We got a call of a burglary here.
- That was about an hour ago.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.896
We didn't ask you that.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.648
Yeah, well, I told you.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.734
Besides, I don't like having
my son out in the cold.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.236
Just tell me what happened, sir.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.072
Somebody broke into the house.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.158
I fired at him with my piece,
and he ran away.

16:33.785 --> 16:37.913
- You didn't get him?
- If I did, he'd be laid out here.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.957
- Is there anything missing?
- No.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.752
Good, no need to make out a report.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.255
- Got a 415 on Florence
between Vermont and Normandie.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.426
Too bad you didn't get him.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.222
Be one less nigger out here
we have to worry about.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.730
Hey, little man, how you doing?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.942
Go on in the house, Tre. Go on.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.616
- Something wrong?
- Something wrong? Yeah.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.454
It's just too bad
you don't know what it is...

17:22.750 --> 17:24.000
...brother.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.515
Ice cream man!

17:38.808 --> 17:40.308
Wait up!

17:53.156 --> 17:54.865
- What's up, Tre?
- What's up?

17:59.996 --> 18:01.163
You ain't shit.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.956
You just like your daddy.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.460
You don't do shit and you
never gonna amount to shit.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.756
All you ever do around here
is eat, sleep and shit.

18:11.007 --> 18:15.135
Look at this place. Way y'all act,
y'all must think I'm the maid.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.305
- Is that it? I gotta go.
- Hell, no, it ain't it!

18:18.514 --> 18:21.349
It ain't it till I say it's it, damn it!

18:23.519 --> 18:24.978
Cigarette.

18:25.188 --> 18:30.150
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock
your ass in the middle of next week.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.281
Where you going, you little fat fuck?
You ain't got a job.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.910
Who's that little fucker
on my porch?

18:46.667 --> 18:50.670
Oh, you're Furious' little boy, huh?

18:50.880 --> 18:54.925
Boy, you look more and more
like your daddy every day.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.384
So tell me something.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.387
How come he don't play cards
with us no more?

18:59.597 --> 19:00.889
I don't know.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.100
I know he don't think
he's better than us.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.394
Too busy shooting at people.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.105
I heard what happened there
the other night.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.736
He still got that same girlfriend?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.446
Excuse me, Mama.

19:18.533 --> 19:23.370
- Why do you always play football?
- Because that's what I'm gonna do.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.955
That's right.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.921
I heard Furious shot
at somebody last night.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.965
- He get him?
- No.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.595
Who is that?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.765
That's my lady, homey.
Her name's Brandi.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.434
She ain't your woman.
She's my woman.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.979
- How, when she my lady?
- She's my wife.

19:49.272 --> 19:53.108
I stick my ding-a-ling in her
every night, so that makes her mine.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.903
Get your ass in here and quit
looking at them boys!

19:57.113 --> 19:58.363
Punk!

19:58.948 --> 20:00.240
Faggot!

20:00.449 --> 20:04.160
Get off me, with your big
4-by-4 head! Get off!

20:04.954 --> 20:06.079
Get off!

20:07.582 --> 20:10.584
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.670
- Where's my ball?
- Man, don't bring that ball.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.885
Me and my daddy going fishing.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.761
We ain't gonna stay long.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.015
- Where's he live?
- He don't live far.

20:28.519 --> 20:33.398
Rick, why you have to bring that ball?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.152
Y'all want to see a dead body?

20:38.779 --> 20:40.030
Yeah.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.450
Tre's daddy blasted
at somebody last night.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.286
Really? What kind of gun
your daddy got?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.956
I think it's a.357 Magnum.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.167
Really? I got a deuce-deuce.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.128
My brother gave it to me
before he went to jail.

20:55.338 --> 20:59.215
I got it under my bed. Want to see?
It's loaded too.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.433
It's up in here.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.738
Damn!

21:22.031 --> 21:24.866
It smell like a dog died.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.830
- Look like Freddy Krueger got him.
- He stink.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.541
That's how they smell after a while.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.003
I wonder why it take them people
so long to pick him up.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.383
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.

21:42.051 --> 21:46.054
- Oh, man.
- Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!

21:46.347 --> 21:49.224
- Hey, throw the ball.
- You ain't gonna see it again.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.852
Don't you know this is a dead body?

21:53.062 --> 21:54.980
Yeah, I know that shit!

21:55.231 --> 21:57.691
He ain't bothering you,
so don't fuck with him!

21:59.235 --> 22:00.735
Throw the ball, little man.

22:01.362 --> 22:02.988
I ain't gonna take it.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.573
Chris, tell him I ain't
gonna take his ball.

22:05.783 --> 22:09.577
I got enough money to buy me
a hundred balls. Shit!

22:11.914 --> 22:14.749
Man, I told you not to bring that ball.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.424
Thanks, coz.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.092
Yo, dog.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.302
Throw the ball.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.265
Shit.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.434
Let's start the game, man.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.523
Man, you stupid!
Don't have no sense.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.818
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell Mama.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.404
Man, shut up. I don't care.
Tell Mama.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.116
Y'all leaving?

22:49.410 --> 22:50.744
Hell, no.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.787
Give me my brother's ball back!

22:54.040 --> 22:56.332
- No, no!
- Come on, man!

22:56.625 --> 23:00.420
No, don't say nothing.
They're just playing.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.300
- Give me my brother's ball back!
- What'd you say, fat boy?

23:05.551 --> 23:08.344
- Give me my brother's ball back be...
- Before what?

23:08.637 --> 23:11.264
What your fat ass gonna do?

23:17.063 --> 23:19.856
Yo, Rock! Give the little nigga
the ball back.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.321
Stupid motherfucker!

23:26.572 --> 23:28.990
I was gonna give it to you too.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.504
Man!

23:49.220 --> 23:51.513
Hey, man, I got a football.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.807
I never use it myself.

23:54.141 --> 23:58.186
- I give it to you when we get home.
- He ain't gonna want it.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.855
His daddy gave him that ball.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.817
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.002
Yo, Rock, give me the ball.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.255
Give me the fucking ball!

24:29.635 --> 24:30.718
Hey!

24:31.387 --> 24:32.720
Hey, little man!

24:36.225 --> 24:37.392
Catch!

24:41.063 --> 24:43.022
Man, you sorry.

24:46.861 --> 24:50.196
- I'm going to the store.
- Why? You ain't got no money.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.407
I'm going anyway.

24:56.245 --> 25:00.373
- So you a leader or a follower?
- I'm a leader.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.710
Okay, then. What's the three rules?

25:03.919 --> 25:06.087
Break it down for me. And, hey...

25:06.380 --> 25:08.590
...think before you answer.
- I got it!

25:09.592 --> 25:14.470
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.

25:14.763 --> 25:18.808
Two was to never be afraid
to ask you for anything.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.935
Stealing isn't necessary.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.688
And the last one, I think, was...

25:23.939 --> 25:27.025
...to never respect anybody
who doesn't respect you back.

25:27.693 --> 25:28.776
That right?

25:29.737 --> 25:32.405
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.458
What do you know about sex?

25:45.711 --> 25:49.297
- I know a little bit.
- Oh, yeah? What little bit is that?

25:49.715 --> 25:52.050
I know, I take a girl...

25:52.259 --> 25:54.469
...stick my thing in her...

25:54.803 --> 25:57.430
...and nine months later
a baby comes out.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.061
You think that's it?

26:03.771 --> 26:05.313
Basically, yeah.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.194
Well, remember this:

26:12.112 --> 26:16.324
Any fool with a dick can make a baby,
but only a real man can raise his kids.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.749
I wasn't but 17 when your mother
was pregnant with you.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.837
All of my friends was dropping out
of high school...

26:30.130 --> 26:34.509
...hanging out in front of liquor stores,
getting drunk, getting high.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.806
Some of them was robbing people.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.267
Some of them was
even killing people.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.020
Hey, you remember
my friend Marcus?

26:47.856 --> 26:51.025
He got into robbing people,
wanted me to join him...

26:51.235 --> 26:54.445
...but I said,
"No, I'm getting ready to have a son."

26:56.115 --> 26:57.532
I knew you'd be a boy.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.206
I wanted to be somebody
you could look up to.

27:05.374 --> 27:09.127
So I guess that's why
I went to Vietnam.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.045
Don't ever go in the Army, Tre.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.382
Black man ain't got no place
in the Army.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.554
Damn!

27:25.227 --> 27:27.020
Why'd you get it all over me?

27:27.271 --> 27:29.647
- Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
- What?

27:29.898 --> 27:33.735
Oh, wait! Listen to this song!
I love this song!

27:47.750 --> 27:49.250
Oh, damn!

27:50.794 --> 27:52.545
Looks like they going to juvie.

27:52.755 --> 27:56.341
No, man. They going to the gates.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.848
- Yo, man, what happened?
- They were stealing.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.562
Come on, Tre. Let's go, son.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.385
Come here, Rick.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.512
Come on, man.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.015
Come here, man. Look at all
these people back here.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.644
There you go!

29:31.854 --> 29:34.063
Want to learn how to barbecue?

29:37.651 --> 29:41.404
You're not watching this meat.
You just standing here poking at it.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.073
- Give him to me, Ricky.
- Shanice, I got him.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.867
Go on back to your friends.

29:46.160 --> 29:50.163
- He's wet. That's why he's crying.
- He ain't wet. Now, go on back.

29:50.372 --> 29:53.291
- Okay.
- Listen, I'm sorry. Come here.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.713
See? That's how y'all got that one.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.384
Ricky, you make sure
she taking them pills.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.845
I don't want a whole stack
of these around.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.306
I'll be the one taking care of them.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.058
- I'll put him to bed.
- Go on to Grandma.

30:11.226 --> 30:15.396
It's all right. All right,
okay, shut up, come on.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.690
And flip that meat over.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.363
I'm winning.

30:25.699 --> 30:28.826
Domino, motherfuckers.
What you say about that?

30:30.454 --> 30:33.873
Fool, that ain't shit.
I beat your ass three times already.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.334
That's just once. Let's play again.

30:38.212 --> 30:42.256
Fuck that, I don't want to play no more.
Let's bust some spades.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.926
- Yeah, I'm with that.
- Bust some spades?

30:45.594 --> 30:46.719
Cool.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.935
- Know how to play spades, Dook?
- Something like that.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.146
I have something for you to suck on.
Here, cut that, G.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.276
I want one of them hootchies
over there.

31:08.242 --> 31:12.370
Dooky, you full of shit. No bitch
gonna give your ugly ass no pussy.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.413
I bet I get more pussy than you.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.290
Yeah.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.793
You get dopehead pussy.

31:19.086 --> 31:22.129
I get more pussy than your
wannabe mack-daddy ass...

31:22.422 --> 31:25.091
- Who you calling wannabe mack?
- You, nigga!

31:25.467 --> 31:27.635
No-pussy-getting motherfucker!

31:27.928 --> 31:30.805
Fucking them dopeheads,
you stupid-ass nigga.

31:30.973 --> 31:34.642
You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dopeheads.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.812
I let them suck my dick,
but I don't fuck them.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.273
They got AIDS and shit.

31:40.482 --> 31:44.485
You can catch that shit from letting
them suck on your dick too.

31:44.695 --> 31:45.820
Thank you.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.782
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.993
What you mean, you ain't skinny?

31:52.202 --> 31:55.496
Motherfucker's skinny enough to
Hula Hoop through a Cheerio.

31:55.789 --> 32:00.918
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.463
- Mark ass.
- Y'all trying to scare me.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.721
Can you really get it from
letting them suck it?

32:12.180 --> 32:13.431
Mark.

32:32.534 --> 32:35.202
Tre? How you doing, baby?

32:35.454 --> 32:38.372
- Fine.
- Good, you just in time for the food.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.875
I'm bringing out
the rest of the things.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.461
Potato salad. You name it, we got it.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.715
- Everybody's here, have a good time.
- Okay.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.384
Oh, and Tre? Baby, do me a favor.

32:50.594 --> 32:54.096
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?

32:54.348 --> 32:57.767
I am so sick and tired of him
going in and out of there.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.020
Maybe some of what you got
will rub off on him.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.897
Okay.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.490
What's up, Dough?

33:12.991 --> 33:16.786
Oh, shit! What up, G?
Tre, love in effect.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.579
Yo, what's up, Tre?

33:18.747 --> 33:22.917
- What's up, Chris?
- Heard you're like Mr. GQ Smooth.

33:24.294 --> 33:28.506
- Working over at the Fox Hills Mall?
- I get discounts on clothes, you like?

33:30.258 --> 33:31.926
You look like you selling rocks.

33:32.135 --> 33:36.263
- Tre, you be slinging that shit?
- No, I don't be doing that shit.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.433
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.521
You know, I'm out of the pen now.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.108
Trying to keep my ass out this time.

33:47.275 --> 33:51.112
- That's what we here to celebrate.
- Yeah.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.657
Damn, brother,
how did you get so big?

33:56.118 --> 33:58.327
Pumping iron and eating, man.

33:58.620 --> 34:01.080
Nothing else to do in
the motherfucking pen.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.417
Three hots and a cot,
know what I'm saying?

34:05.127 --> 34:08.254
Rest of the time I was reading
and writing my girl.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.672
- Reading?
- Yeah, motherfucker.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.176
I ain't no criminal. I can read, bitch.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.179
Who is that, Shanice?

34:18.473 --> 34:20.683
That's Tre, Ricky's best friend.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.811
He was best friends with Doughboy
when they was little.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.313
They be trying to act
like they brothers.

34:26.606 --> 34:30.275
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!

34:30.485 --> 34:34.321
- He go to Washington?
- He go to Crenshaw.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.449
I seen him before.
He work at the Fox Hills Mall.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.870
Do he got a girlfriend?

34:42.164 --> 34:43.330
Yes.

34:51.380 --> 34:55.342
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping
on this ho's man.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.680
He fine, anyway. You better watch
his ass. Somebody might steal him.

35:02.184 --> 35:04.685
All right, y'all, come and get it!

35:13.487 --> 35:17.156
- Do you live here?
- Okay, girl. Sorry-ass niggas.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.241
Come on.

35:19.534 --> 35:23.537
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen
and let these ladies eat first!

35:25.165 --> 35:28.375
Yeah, you act like you ain't
never had no barbecue before.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.212
Let the ladies eat.
Ho's gotta eat too.

35:31.421 --> 35:34.673
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.218
Oops. I'm sorry, bitch.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.930
- Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
- Just playing.

35:41.223 --> 35:43.933
All right, enjoy. And be nice.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.437
Get out of the way!
You still up here?

35:50.732 --> 35:52.858
- Hi.
- Hello.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.152
So why haven't you called?

35:57.697 --> 35:59.532
Just one minute.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.586
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.422
- I know. I'm just taking my time.
- Oh, I see.

36:15.674 --> 36:19.552
- You trying to run that game on her.
- Yeah, how am I doing?

36:19.761 --> 36:22.429
Well, you're doing just fine.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.974
- Except for one thing.
- Yeah, what's that?

36:25.267 --> 36:26.433
She left.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.893
What?

36:28.895 --> 36:31.230
- Damn!
- That's all right.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.900
Hey, hey, hey.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.448
Ain't this a bitch?

36:44.619 --> 36:46.620
Wait! Wait!

36:50.458 --> 36:53.961
- Don't worry about it. I got her.
- Is she all right?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.463
All right, G.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.308
Sheryl! Come on!

37:10.312 --> 37:14.815
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.735
You got some blow?
You got some rock?

37:17.986 --> 37:22.323
- I'll suck your dick.
- Just keep the baby out the streets.

37:23.325 --> 37:27.328
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.673
What up, punk? What up, fool?

37:44.346 --> 37:45.679
Mark.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.364
- What is that? Barbecue?
- Yeah.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.875
- I know you didn't bring me no swine.
- No.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.795
Mrs. Baker told me
to bring you a plate.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.714
- Brenda, huh?
- Yeah.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.052
She might've had a chance
if she didn't talk so much.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.389
Let's see.

38:36.523 --> 38:40.526
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.

38:42.404 --> 38:46.115
Hey, Pop, can you fix my fade
back here? And up here?

38:46.825 --> 38:48.242
I'm eating.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.120
After you eat.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.332
Yeah.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.213
Yeah, real close.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.925
So I can brush it, you know,
hook up some waves.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.473
Something wrong?

39:12.892 --> 39:14.101
Nope.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.486
What's the problem?

39:26.906 --> 39:28.615
You're getting old, Pop.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.869
- I'm getting old?
- Yeah.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.955
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.666
- You older than dirt.
- I'm older than dirt?

39:37.959 --> 39:42.087
- Yes.
- I ain't but 17 years older than you.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.424
Your friends, they got fathers
in their 40s and 50s.

39:45.633 --> 39:49.511
These cats are great big...
Just slobs, man.

39:49.804 --> 39:53.515
- You know, bellies out to here.
- Yes. That's gonna be you!

39:53.808 --> 39:56.977
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old, fat, juicy roll...

39:57.187 --> 39:59.813
...double-jelly-roll belly. Right?

40:00.023 --> 40:03.817
Sitting in a rocking chair,
reading the funny papers!

40:04.027 --> 40:07.112
Then your grandchildren will be
running around, saying:

40:07.322 --> 40:10.991
"Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar."

40:11.201 --> 40:12.326
You think so, huh?

40:12.786 --> 40:13.952
Yeah.

40:14.454 --> 40:15.996
Wait a minute, man.

40:17.207 --> 40:20.125
What's all this
about grandkids, man?

40:20.335 --> 40:22.127
You using the rubbers I gave you?

40:22.337 --> 40:25.422
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy,
all right? I just...

40:25.632 --> 40:28.175
I ain't ready for all of that.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.844
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.347
Why are you sweating me, man?

40:34.349 --> 40:37.309
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it. Come here.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.727
What?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.480
All right?

40:49.864 --> 40:52.950
What? I stink now?
I got something on me?

40:54.994 --> 40:56.870
- You had some pussy yet?
- What?

40:57.163 --> 41:00.499
- You had some pussy yet?
- Yeah! Yeah!

41:00.708 --> 41:01.959
When?

41:02.210 --> 41:04.002
- What?
- When?

41:06.339 --> 41:09.716
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.885
Go on, sit down, now.

41:19.894 --> 41:24.565
It was a Sunday, right? Rick and I
were kicking it up on Crenshaw.

41:24.732 --> 41:27.234
This group of females
rolled up in a Rabbit.

41:27.402 --> 41:32.406
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?

41:32.574 --> 41:37.202
Man, there was this one girl
everybody was trying to rush.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.872
Baby was fine!

41:40.707 --> 41:43.542
Body was booming,
like right out of Jet centerfold.

41:45.879 --> 41:47.588
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.

41:47.755 --> 41:51.633
She walks right up on me
and busts out, "Is this your ride?"

41:52.218 --> 41:55.429
Then I say, "Yeah, you want to go
for a ride with me?"

41:55.597 --> 41:58.891
She says, "No, I want to drive it."

41:59.100 --> 42:02.728
I say, "Can you drive stick?"

42:02.937 --> 42:07.107
She says,
"I can learn if you teach me."

42:08.401 --> 42:13.030
I go into mack-daddy mode because
I'm getting a woody in my sweats.

42:13.239 --> 42:17.951
I says, "Why don't you give me your
number, I'll call you for a lesson."

42:19.287 --> 42:20.954
She does.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.124
About a week later,
I'm over at her house.

42:24.334 --> 42:27.169
Her mom and grandma
are leaving for church.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.963
I walk right up to the door, man.

42:30.173 --> 42:33.634
As soon as I go inside, boom!
We go at it, nonstop.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.469
Kissing, hugging, right?

42:35.678 --> 42:38.639
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.

42:41.476 --> 42:46.146
Well, about 20 minutes into it,
Mom and Grandma's come home.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.565
Seems Grandma forgot her purse.

42:48.858 --> 42:52.194
Wanted to make sure she has
something for the collection plate.

42:54.322 --> 42:58.575
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex
in the air or something, right?

43:03.164 --> 43:06.458
She starts straight
towards Tisha's room.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.882
That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.010
I call her once in a while...

43:17.303 --> 43:22.683
...but when I do, her mom or grandma
say, "She can't talk right now.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.602
She busy, doing the dishes."

43:28.606 --> 43:32.526
- What'd you use?
- I used the number she gave me.

43:35.697 --> 43:37.197
Why are you sweating me?

43:37.407 --> 43:40.367
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.167
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...

43:49.377 --> 43:51.420
...you use something anyway.

43:55.383 --> 43:58.051
A pill ain't gonna keep
your dick from falling off.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.558
I don't know why you insist on
learning things the hard way...

44:04.767 --> 44:07.394
...but you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!

44:11.274 --> 44:12.733
Clean up that hair.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.037
What's up, man?

44:26.205 --> 44:28.582
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- What?

44:28.791 --> 44:32.294
You slamming my door like
some gorilla on a football field!

44:32.587 --> 44:36.089
- Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

44:44.724 --> 44:46.099
Guess what, man.

44:46.768 --> 44:49.770
- Recruiter from SC's coming tonight.
- Cool.

44:50.897 --> 44:53.398
You know, man,
I never lied to my father.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.275
Never?

44:56.277 --> 44:58.195
Well, almost never.

45:00.573 --> 45:04.242
Where's all this coming from?

45:04.952 --> 45:08.830
I lied to Pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.458
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?

45:12.585 --> 45:13.627
Is you?

45:14.796 --> 45:16.963
Well, technically speaking, I haven't.

45:17.215 --> 45:19.508
You know, I fingered
a couple of honeys...

45:19.759 --> 45:24.429
...and sucked on some titties,
but I ain't never stuck it in.

45:24.639 --> 45:25.931
Why not, man?

45:26.140 --> 45:29.851
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, I asked you, didn't I?

45:31.646 --> 45:33.105
I was afraid.

45:38.361 --> 45:40.487
- Shit!
- Get off me.

45:48.287 --> 45:51.540
- See, man? Shut up. Shut up.
- What you doing, man?

45:54.836 --> 45:56.378
What you afraid of, man?

45:57.171 --> 45:58.755
Of being a daddy.

46:00.007 --> 46:02.467
Oh, well, yeah.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.344
But I'm getting old now, see?

46:04.637 --> 46:08.473
And now that I want to flap some
skins, Brandi ain't even down for it.

46:08.683 --> 46:13.019
- Even with a jimmy she ain't down.
- Is that right?

46:19.694 --> 46:21.111
Straight up?

46:22.196 --> 46:25.365
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.242
What's that?

46:28.035 --> 46:29.536
All right, you got it.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.205
- I don't see that.
- Why the silent treatment?

46:32.498 --> 46:34.666
You haven't talked to me
in five days!

46:34.876 --> 46:37.043
You tell your father to say
you're not home.

46:37.295 --> 46:41.173
- Then you take the phone off the hook!
- Well, I been busy.

46:41.382 --> 46:46.011
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass
excuse for a lie like that!

46:46.304 --> 46:50.390
What did I do that was so bad that
you just had to stop talking to me?

46:50.600 --> 46:54.728
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the program.

46:55.229 --> 46:59.691
I told you about that. I'm Catholic,
and it goes against my morals.

46:59.901 --> 47:04.696
Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed
to be one of the biggest hootchies.

47:04.906 --> 47:09.743
- When you bust a cap on somebody?
- I bust a cap like, blam-blam.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.245
Damn! God!

47:26.552 --> 47:29.596
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!

47:34.560 --> 47:37.938
You say you want to wait till
you get married first, right?

47:38.105 --> 47:39.648
No, look at me. Right?

47:39.982 --> 47:41.066
Yes.

47:41.275 --> 47:45.237
And I say that I'm gonna be
the one who marries you.

47:45.905 --> 47:49.115
So it don't make no difference
when we do it...

47:49.283 --> 47:50.992
...we still gonna get married, right?

47:51.452 --> 47:53.954
Yeah, but I'm going to college
before I marry...

47:54.121 --> 47:57.749
...and there ain't no guarantee
that I'm gonna marry you!

48:05.633 --> 48:07.300
Bad shit!

48:07.468 --> 48:10.470
- Shit, look at this.
- Oh, shit.

48:10.638 --> 48:13.598
Hey, hey, yo. Yo, bonita.

48:15.142 --> 48:16.476
Damn, she got a banging ass.

48:16.686 --> 48:20.814
Chica bonita. You come to my casa
and let's do the loco thing.

48:21.023 --> 48:24.192
Hey, Dooky, this fool trying
to speak Spanish...

48:26.279 --> 48:28.321
- That shit worked.
- What up, baby?

48:28.531 --> 48:31.700
So let me knock the stuffing
off that Egg McMuffin.

48:32.952 --> 48:34.452
You got a phone number?

48:46.007 --> 48:50.010
- You haven't even given me a ring!
- I ain't ready for all that yet!

48:50.177 --> 48:52.679
But you're ready to act
like we are, though?

48:59.061 --> 49:01.187
- With your mad self.
- Don't touch me.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.564
All right.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.706
- You make me sick, man.
- I know, but I missed you.

49:19.999 --> 49:23.209
I missed you too.

49:36.223 --> 49:38.183
He still ain't fucked her yet.

49:46.776 --> 49:49.027
You better take your ass
to the store with that.

49:49.528 --> 49:51.780
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

49:52.531 --> 49:55.116
No, that's not all I think about.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.035
Yeah.

49:57.578 --> 50:00.747
- Okay, hang on. Pop!
- Yo!

50:01.040 --> 50:03.249
Brandi's mom say you're cute!

50:03.542 --> 50:06.753
Ask her how come she don't say hi
when I speak to her.

50:07.004 --> 50:10.131
He say, how come she don't say hi
when he speak to her?

50:11.258 --> 50:12.425
Yeah.

50:13.511 --> 50:17.430
Hey, I'm supposed to be talking
to you, not passing messages.

50:18.724 --> 50:22.268
If my daddy mess with your mama,
we gonna be brother and sister.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.938
Then we have to do
that incest thing.

50:25.147 --> 50:26.439
What?

50:26.732 --> 50:31.027
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.947
Who this?

50:34.573 --> 50:36.032
Oh, hi, Mama.

50:36.617 --> 50:40.161
Yeah. Hang on, I got Brandi
on the other line, okay?

50:44.041 --> 50:46.584
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

50:46.794 --> 50:49.462
Tre, this is your mother.

50:51.465 --> 50:54.801
I'm sorry, Mama.
Hang on for one second. Okay.

50:55.928 --> 50:58.763
Brandi?
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

50:58.973 --> 50:59.973
Okay.

51:01.851 --> 51:02.934
Hi, Mama.

51:03.144 --> 51:05.186
"Who this?"

51:05.479 --> 51:07.856
What kind of way is that
to answer the phone?

51:08.441 --> 51:09.816
I'm sorry, Mama.

51:10.192 --> 51:14.362
- Why didn't you come this weekend?
- I was cooling with Rick.

51:15.948 --> 51:18.074
You can cool
with your friends anytime.

51:18.325 --> 51:21.286
The weekends are supposed
to be our time together.

51:22.997 --> 51:25.665
Have you thought about
what we talked about?

51:26.333 --> 51:27.500
Yeah.

51:28.169 --> 51:29.461
And?

51:30.671 --> 51:32.130
I don't know yet.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.176
Let me speak to your daddy.

51:37.845 --> 51:38.845
Pop!

51:39.180 --> 51:40.472
Telephone!

51:43.517 --> 51:44.517
Who this?

51:44.852 --> 51:47.520
Hey, how you doing?

51:48.606 --> 51:51.524
Yeah. Yeah, we talked about that.

51:53.194 --> 51:55.528
Yeah, well, look...

51:56.197 --> 51:59.532
I know you don't agree with me,
but I think it's his decision.

51:59.825 --> 52:02.994
Look, I don't...
No, I don't think that's necessary.

52:04.205 --> 52:07.665
Look, Reva. Reva, this is bullshit.

52:09.043 --> 52:11.419
I'm sorry, but I think it's ridiculous.

52:11.712 --> 52:15.548
There's no reason for him
to come live with you now.

52:15.758 --> 52:17.550
He's not a baby!

52:18.302 --> 52:19.344
No.

52:19.512 --> 52:22.764
No, no, wait a minute.
Why you got an attitude?

52:23.015 --> 52:25.225
I don't have an attitude.
You have an attitude!

52:25.684 --> 52:29.229
We have gone through this
a thousand times. I always tell him...

52:29.438 --> 52:31.898
...use a rubber!
You know, use a rubber...

52:32.775 --> 52:34.651
Watch me shoot this motherfucker.

52:35.736 --> 52:36.945
Look.

52:39.365 --> 52:40.532
Yeah.

52:40.908 --> 52:44.369
- Taken off the motherfucking set.
- Hey, yo, Monster, man.

52:44.578 --> 52:48.456
Don't be cussing so motherfucking
loud. My moms don't like that shit.

52:48.707 --> 52:52.585
Come on, man, move the plastic.
You're sitting on the good part.

52:52.878 --> 52:54.087
Damn!

52:54.380 --> 52:55.547
Darin?

52:57.216 --> 52:59.467
See, now I gotta hear this shit.

53:00.594 --> 53:01.970
Darin!

53:03.097 --> 53:05.765
- What?
- Get them drive-by shooters out of...

53:05.933 --> 53:09.936
Damn! Moms be fucking
with his ass without fail.

53:10.229 --> 53:12.105
She ain't like that with Rick, though.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.482
Because they got different daddies.

53:14.733 --> 53:19.112
Y'all got to get the fuck out.
My brother got company in a minute.

53:19.405 --> 53:22.699
- See that? I didn't get my turn.
- It's Monster's fault.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.951
Come on, man. Fix that shit, man.

53:31.292 --> 53:32.625
What up, man?

53:33.085 --> 53:34.502
What up, dude?

53:35.129 --> 53:36.212
Who that?

54:05.868 --> 54:08.661
Anybody know
where Ricky Baker lives?

54:09.663 --> 54:11.664
That's my brother! He live here.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.167
Hey, yo, Rick!
The man here to see you!

54:14.460 --> 54:15.835
Stop.

54:18.297 --> 54:20.673
Stop. Hold still. Be still.

54:20.841 --> 54:21.841
There, I got it.

54:22.051 --> 54:24.636
Yo, Rick! Get your ass out of there.

54:24.845 --> 54:27.680
Ricky, come on out
of the bathroom, baby.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.476
Check this out.
Here come the reverend.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.774
So, what college you from?

54:38.025 --> 54:40.026
I'm from USC.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.695
You got to have a scholarship
to go to SC?

54:43.822 --> 54:45.365
No, but it helps.

54:45.699 --> 54:47.784
Can you hook me up
with a scholarship?

54:48.410 --> 54:51.287
- What do you do?
- I used to play baseball.

54:51.997 --> 54:53.039
Shut up, man.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.709
Don't you know
the man's about business?

54:57.002 --> 55:00.213
Move, nigga. Move, punk.

55:01.048 --> 55:02.340
Move.

55:06.679 --> 55:08.221
Y'all be the fuck quiet.

55:08.430 --> 55:09.514
Hello.

55:09.890 --> 55:12.308
I'm Lewis Crump.
You must be Ricky's mother?

55:12.726 --> 55:13.726
Brenda.

55:13.936 --> 55:16.354
And this is my other son, Darin.

55:16.563 --> 55:18.064
- Hello, Darin.
- What's up?

55:18.315 --> 55:20.233
Can I get you something to drink?

55:20.401 --> 55:22.735
- Coffee, water, soda?
- No, thank you.

55:23.195 --> 55:25.613
We met at the game
against Washington.

55:25.864 --> 55:30.702
I remember. That was a good game.
You picked up 276 yards in that game.

55:30.911 --> 55:32.537
- That's impressive.
- Thanks.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.248
Well, why don't y'all sit and talk?

55:36.917 --> 55:37.959
Hey!

55:56.729 --> 56:00.898
I want you to know, we're interested
in you coming to the campus.

56:01.108 --> 56:04.652
Get a good look around, you know,
a feel for the school as a whole.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.160
Here's my tape.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.501
That was against Banning
my junior year.

56:21.879 --> 56:25.006
Man, we lost that year,
but I did pretty well in yardage.

56:26.133 --> 56:28.885
They had the best defense
in the city that year.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.600
Big country booty!
Big country titties!

56:35.809 --> 56:38.311
- Boo-ya!
- That's what I'm saying.

56:38.604 --> 56:41.606
From eating all that corn bread
and shit, I guess.

56:43.650 --> 56:47.653
Shit. Me, I go to college
just for the ho's.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.697
You don't go there to talk to bitches.

56:49.990 --> 56:52.158
You're supposed to be
learning something.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.787
Can't learn shit,
talking to no stupid-ass bitch.

56:59.708 --> 57:02.835
- Yo, check out that 808.
- Damn, that shit bumping.

57:03.712 --> 57:06.839
What are you interested in
beside playing ball?

57:08.675 --> 57:10.343
- Like, what you mean?
- I mean...

57:10.552 --> 57:14.514
...what do you want to major in? What
kind of degree would you pursue?

57:14.681 --> 57:18.059
I'm just asking because
there's a strong possibility...

57:18.352 --> 57:21.187
...that you won't go into the NFL
after college.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.689
Just a fact. It happens.

57:24.191 --> 57:26.651
Yeah, I heard that before.

57:27.361 --> 57:30.321
Actually, I was thinking
about majoring in business.

57:30.531 --> 57:34.992
I got this friend, Tre, who's always
talked about going into business.

57:35.202 --> 57:37.703
Plus, I like computers.
Maybe I could do that.

57:38.372 --> 57:39.747
What do you think?

57:40.040 --> 57:43.835
Young brother, I think you can do
anything you put your mind to.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.884
I tell you where y'all need to go.

57:52.177 --> 57:56.347
Where they got more women
than anywhere. Fine ones too.

57:56.557 --> 57:58.975
- Crenshaw on Sunday nights.
- No.

57:59.184 --> 58:02.728
- Street races on Florence?
- No, nigga. Y'all way off.

58:03.272 --> 58:05.231
I give y'all a hint.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.400
Everybody's been there.

58:07.568 --> 58:10.903
- Where?
- Where, nigga? Spit it out!

58:11.697 --> 58:12.905
The church.

58:13.115 --> 58:15.241
Oh, shit!

58:15.492 --> 58:20.371
Nigga, please! Ain't nobody going
to church to catch no bitches.

58:20.581 --> 58:24.584
I should roll your ass up off
this porch for that stupid shit.

58:25.627 --> 58:29.213
So basically you have
a 2.3 overall GPA...

58:29.423 --> 58:31.507
...according to the classes
we require.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.093
All you have to do
is take the SAT test.

58:34.803 --> 58:36.095
Yeah.

58:36.597 --> 58:38.431
I heard about that test.

58:38.640 --> 58:42.059
The next one's being offered,
let's see...

58:42.394 --> 58:44.896
...early October.
Are you gonna take it?

58:45.105 --> 58:47.940
I guess so. I can't get into
college without it, right?

58:48.233 --> 58:52.111
Just remember, all you have
to do is get over a 700.

58:52.613 --> 58:55.448
- Okay.
- Come here. Come here!

58:56.116 --> 59:00.077
I'm sorry, I'm trying to give
him a bath. Come here.

59:02.164 --> 59:03.623
Your little brother?

59:04.041 --> 59:06.292
No, that's my son.

59:10.130 --> 59:13.633
Well, I'll look forward
to talking to you again.

59:14.176 --> 59:16.344
We'll also arrange that tour for you.

59:16.595 --> 59:18.179
Thank you, Mr. Crump.

59:18.931 --> 59:21.307
You bet, Ricky. Bye-bye.

59:25.562 --> 59:29.649
You gonna give me a scholarship?
Because I want to go to college too.

59:29.942 --> 59:32.818
- Man, shut the fuck up.
- Fuck you, nigga.

59:33.111 --> 59:35.488
It's my porch.
You can take your dumb-ass home.

59:35.697 --> 59:38.616
My baby is going to a university.

59:40.702 --> 59:43.663
I always knew you would
amount to something.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.331
I did.

59:45.707 --> 59:50.169
When you were little, you used to
always run around with that football.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.673
I'm proud of you, baby.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.801
- Thanks, Mama.
- You make your mama proud.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.682
May I have your attention?

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:06.644
The SAT test will be
administered in this room.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:11.190
When you receive your test book,
please keep it closed on your desk.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:14.527
Read the directions on the
front cover of your test book.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.155
Use a number two pencil in
marking your answer sheet.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.617
Ink or ballpoint pen
is not to be used.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.705
If you do not have
a number two pencil with you...

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:30.376
...raise your hand and keep it up.
We'll pass a pencil out to you.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:35.047
During the time allotted for a section,
you may work on that section only.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.883
If you finish a section
before time is called...

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:42.888
...you may not go back to a previous
section or on to the next one.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.725
You have 30 minutes
for section one.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:49.562
Open your test books and begin work.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.623
- This it?
- Yeah.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.469
Damn!

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:06.472
Baby got more cakes
than Duncan Hines!

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.973
Damn.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:11.936
Bet you bite a chip.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:17.316
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't
moved two percent in five years.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.486
- "Furious Styles Financial."
- Talk to you later.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.994
So how you guys think
you did on the test?

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.831
All right, I guess.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:39.380
Those tests are culturally biased.
The only universal part is the math.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:44.760
You boys must be hungry.
I'm real surprised to see you.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.971
Came to see you.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.807
See how you doing.
How's business going?

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:54.061
Well, there's always business,
just not always in here.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:55.521
What do you do, Furious?

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.816
You help people get money
for homes or what?

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:03.195
Well, there is no "or what."
That's what I do, Rick.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:10.411
- You boys want to see something?
- Do we have a choice?

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.291
No.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:58.250
I don't know about all this. Got us
walking around Compton and all.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.086
Rick, it's the '90s.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:04.340
We can't afford to be afraid
of our own people anymore.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.137
Would you two knuckleheads
come on?

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:19.063
I want y'all to look at that sign.
See what it says?

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:22.900
"Cash for your home."
You know what that is?

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:25.986
- It's a billboard.
- Billboard.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.988
What are y'all, Amos and Andy?

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.115
Are you Steppin' and he's Fetchit?

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.118
I'm talking about the message.
What it stands for.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.955
It's called "gentrification."

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:40.417
It's what happens when property value
of a certain area is brought down.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:42.670
- You listening?
- Yeah.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:46.674
They bring the property value down.
They can buy the land cheaper.

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:50.970
Then they move the people out,
raise the value and sell it at a profit.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:56.433
What we need to do is keep
everything in our neighborhood black.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.394
Black-owned with black money.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:02.439
Just like the Jews, the Italians,
the Mexicans and the Koreans do.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:06.110
Ain't nobody from outside bringing
down the property value.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.653
It's these folk!

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:12.449
Shooting each other and selling
that crack rock and shit.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.702
How you think crack
gets into the country?

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:18.789
We don't own any planes.
We don't own no ships.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.835
We are not the people who are flying
and floating that shit in here.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:27.047
Every time you turn on a TV,
that's what you see.

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:31.176
Black people selling the rock,
pushing the rock. Yeah, I know.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:34.013
It wasn't a problem
when it was here.

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:36.432
Wasn't a problem
until it was in lowa...

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.852
...and on Wall Street where
there's hardly any black people.

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:42.521
If you want to talk about guns...

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:45.941
...why is it that there's a gun shop
on every corner here?

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.444
- Why?
- I'll tell you why.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:52.823
Same reason there's a liquor store on
every corner in the black community.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:55.242
Why? They want us
to kill ourselves.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:58.370
You go out to Beverly Hills,
you don't see that shit.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.664
They want to us to kill ourselves.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:05.502
The best way to destroy a people is to
take away their ability to reproduce.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:10.174
Who is it that's dying out here on
these streets every night? Y'all.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.844
- Yeah.
- Young brothers like yourselves.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.514
What am I supposed to do?
Fool roll up, try to smoke me?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.851
I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker
if he don't kill me first.

01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:23.354
You doing exactly
what they want you to do.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:27.024
You have to think, young brother,
about your future.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.236
Damn, man.
You know, Furious is deep.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:36.075
- He used to be a preacher?
- He ain't never been no preacher.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.077
Just reads a lot.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:42.081
My brother should've
heard that, man.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.416
Would've done him some good.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:45.751
Where he at?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:50.756
Where else, man? Up on Crenshaw
with the rest of them fools.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.300
- Let's go.
- Cool.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:22.287
- What up, Monster?
- What up, nigga?

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.665
Goddamn, there's a lot
of motherfuckers here.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.625
Don't be using God's name in vain.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:28.419
What?

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:29.795
Man, shut up.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.297
Yo, man, you believe in God?

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:36.552
Yo, why the fuck y'all get
so damn religi-fied lately?

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.637
Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:42.474
This is an A and B conversation.
You can see your way out of it.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.810
You can see your way out
of my ride...

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:47.813
...and we'll see your crippled ass
walking home.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:51.567
Man, look. Do I believe in God?
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:55.279
How else can you have the sun,
moon and stars and shit like that?

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:59.992
Sun, moon, stars, quasars.
Motherfucker sound like Elroy Jetson.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:01.827
There ain't no God.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.582
If there was a God, why he be letting
motherfuckers get smoked?

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:12.129
- Babies and little kids, tell me that.
- You tell me this, nigga.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.841
How you know God's a he? He could
be a she. You don't know that.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:19.886
For one thing, you don't know what
the fuck I be motherfucking knowing.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.346
I read about this shit
when I was in the pen.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:26.518
It was this book, right,
and it was telling...

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.854
...life in the perspective
if God was a bitch.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:35.194
Said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't
be no nuclear bombs, no wars...

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.362
...because that ain't
in a bitch's nature.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:42.201
Why every time you talk about
a female you say "bitch" or "ho"?

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.870
- Because that's what you are.
- Nigga, fuck you.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.005
Hey, hey.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:56.215
What's up?

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:57.841
What up, D?

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:17.653
- What's up, Mon?
- What's up, Rick? Tre.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.865
What's happening?

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.368
- Where y'all coming from?
- Compton.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.203
What y'all doing over here, man?

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:31.207
We're kicking it. Philosophizing
on God, church, bitches and all.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.920
I'm schooling these niggas
on the aspect of religion.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:38.215
- Religion?
- And on factual, actual studies.

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:40.300
You know what I'm saying?

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.261
- Y'all coming from Compton?
- Yeah.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:46.932
- Thought you were scared of Compton.
- Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:50.227
It was deep, though.
You should've been there, man.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:53.772
Pops was talking, speaking, man.
Speaking the truth and shit.

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:58.277
Your pops is like
motherfucking Malcolm Farrakhan.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.458
Man, what's wrong with you?

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.129
Fuck you looking at, nigga?

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.965
I'm still trying to find out, nigga!

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.467
We got a problem here?

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:27.097
We got a problem here?
We got a problem, nigga?

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.016
- What up with this?
- Put the gun away.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:31.935
Can't we have one night
where nobody gets shot?

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:35.814
- Shut up, bitch.
- Bitch, I will fuck you up!

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:39.151
Let's get that bitch!
Fuck you like that.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.543
Ferris always trying
to start some shit.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:01.298
Nigga can't fight, so he always trying
to find an excuse to shoot somebody.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:04.301
That's why fools be getting
shot all the time.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:08.055
Trying to show how hard they is.
Ignorant.

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:10.891
Fool, shut up.
You be doing that shit too.

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.184
I know.

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:36.083
Hey, man, come on. Let's go!

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:45.300
I'm getting the fuck out of L.A.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:48.220
Fuck this shit. Fuck it.

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:52.557
You can't go nowhere without
it getting all shot up and shit.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:58.188
Shit!

01:11:58.398 --> 01:12:00.357
Shit! Fuck!

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:10.033
Driver! Put your hands
on the steering wheel!

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:31.847
- Got any drugs or weapons on you?
- No.

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:35.976
I didn't do nothing.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.730
You think you tough.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.649
You think you're tough, huh?

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.488
You scared now, huh?

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:52.868
I like that. That's why I took this job.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:56.621
I hate little motherfuckers like you.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:02.794
Little niggers, you ain't shit!
Think you tough, huh?

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:07.132
I could blow your head off,
and you couldn't do shit.

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:09.760
How you feel now?

01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:12.679
What set you from?

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:16.933
Look like one of them
Crenshaw Mafia motherfuckers.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:20.812
No, you probably one of them
Rolling 60s, huh?

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.318
12-Adam-63, we have
a possible 187 in blue VW...

01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:28.987
...at corner of
Florence and Vermont.

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:35.494
Again, a possible 187 in blue VW
at corner of Florence and Vermont.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:36.703
Stay out of trouble.

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.999
You gentlemen have
a nice evening now, you hear?

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.990
Hi.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:19.830
- I thought something happened to you.
- Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:24.376
I'm tired of hearing them
shooting all the time.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.049
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:35.887
I'm tired of this shit.

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:39.474
Those two motherfuckers.

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:42.978
I could kill all these motherfuckers.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.063
I'm sick and fucking tired
of this shit!

01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:47.065
I'm fucking sick of this shit!

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:50.777
I'm so fucking tired of this shit!
Fuck this shit!

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.614
Stupid motherfucker!
Fucking fuck you! Fuck you!

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:58.785
I wish I could kill all you!
Come on at me, motherfucker!

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.957
What's so funny?

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:51.963
I never thought I'd be crying
in front of a female.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.635
You can cry in front of me.

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:27.624
What do you think about...

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.961
...people getting married
while they're still in college?

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.172
Are you trying to ask me something?

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:35.799
No.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:40.178
I just wanted to know what you thought
about that kind of situation.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:46.643
I think it can be good
if two people really love each other.

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:49.354
Really?

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:51.398
Yeah.

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:57.237
You sure you're down for this?

01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.823
Yeah. Are you?

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.199
Yeah.

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:05.036
I mean, yes, I am.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:12.711
I don't want to get pregnant.

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:14.754
You won't.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.209
Hi. I'm looking for
a Miss Devereaux?

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.879
- She's right over there.
- Thank you.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.390
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:13.396
You look nice.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.690
Thank you. So do you.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.108
Thanks.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:18.818
Thanks for coming.

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:21.112
So...

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.074
So this is...

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.117
...definitely you.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:30.914
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.000
I thought we were
gonna talk about Tre.

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:37.962
Espresso, please.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:39.923
Café au lait, please.

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.720
I bought him some shoes yesterday.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.473
Why are you always
buying him stuff?

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.351
Can't I be nice to my son?
Do I have that right?

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:55.522
Yes, but he has a job. You don't
have to always buy him stuff.

01:18:55.815 --> 01:18:57.023
Look...

01:18:57.483 --> 01:18:59.984
...did he tell you he wants
to move in with Brandi?

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:02.153
Yeah. So?

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:04.989
"Yeah. So?"

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:08.243
So don't you think that's a bad idea?

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:17.502
I think that Tre is old enough
to make his own decisions, Reva.

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:22.674
You're his father. That means you
were supposed to guide his decisions.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:25.343
What have I been doing
for the last seven years?

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.263
- Not that, evidently.
- Listen, Reva...

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:32.976
...it's time for you to let go.
I know you want to play the mommy...

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:37.021
...but Tre is a grown man now.
He's not a little boy anymore.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:40.358
That time has passed, sweetheart.
You missed it.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:44.279
Excuse me,
I'm getting some cigarettes.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:47.073
You're not getting off that easy.
Sit your ass down.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.033
Excuse me?

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:54.205
I said sit down before I raise my voice
and make a fool out of both of us.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.666
Okay.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:03.715
Now it's my time to talk.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:07.677
Of course you took in
your son, my son...

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.554
...our son...

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.849
...and you taught him to be a man.
I'll give you that...

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.810
...because most men ain't man enough
to do what you did.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:21.399
But that gives you no reason,
do you hear me, no reason...

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:25.445
...to tell me that I can't be
a mother to my son.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.198
What you did...

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:33.745
...is no different from what mothers
have done from the beginning of time.

01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:37.332
It's just too bad
more brothers won't do the same.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.751
But don't think you're special.

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:44.380
You may be cute, but not special.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.135
Drink your café au lait. It's on me.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:57.936
Everybody in the mall was running.
Bitches running out of Contempo's.

01:20:58.229 --> 01:21:00.730
Motherfuckers throwing cookies
out the cookie shop.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.732
Niggas was getting their bail on.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:06.069
I was smoking every motherfucker
that came in.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:09.989
I thought I'd let y'all know that.
Understands me?

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.282
What's up?

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:15.620
You missing all the action.
Niggas getting smoked and shit.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:26.965
Who's them niggas?

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:29.133
Man, pick Chris up.

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.636
Punk might start trippin'.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:36.599
That's those fools from Crenshaw.
Damn, I ain't even got my gat.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.444
Motherfucker ain't got
nothing better to do.

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:51.906
Twenty-seven years old.
Still fucking motherfuckers our age...

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.950
...with his old ass.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:55.285
What's up?

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:56.869
Anyway...

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:01.291
...I saw you roll out of Brandi crib
at 2 in the motherfucking morning.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:03.960
Yo, man, that's my business.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:06.254
Yeah. Handle your shit, G.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.965
- Peer pressure, man.
- Handle your shit.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.175
Don't be like this motherfucker.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:15.430
This motherfucker got babies,
in-house pussy.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:17.765
Let me do shit like that,
Ma would be like:

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.517
"I ain't having it."

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:21.936
Ricky.

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:24.022
Ricky!

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:26.274
You know you heard me.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:28.026
What?

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.278
I need you to go get some cornmeal.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.739
Yeah. I'll go in a little while.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:39.996
You wanna land a good job, you have
to know what most employers want.

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:44.250
Like how to motivate yourself.
How to lead others.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.711
How to perform under pressure.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:51.633
Learn these things in the Army.
No matter what career you choose...

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:55.678
...you'll really be ready to take off.

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:00.016
Ricky, get up and go now.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:02.602
I can't finish frying the fish without it.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:05.938
Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:09.567
You ought to be happy
somebody's cooking for your ass.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.362
- Give me some, Dook.
- Here, take it.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:14.072
- What's up?
- What's happening?

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.949
D, go to the store for me
and get some cornmeal?

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:21.245
Nigga, I ain't the one she told
to go get it. She's your wife.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.206
She ain't my wife, man.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:24.874
Shit.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.585
Might as well be,
y'all got a family and shit.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.505
"Tecmo Bowl" playing motherfucker.

01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:32.799
Fuck you, man.
Go to the store with me.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.300
Sure, let's do it.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:35.593
What?

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:39.597
Don't fuck me, fuck your wife.
That's why you got a baby.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.016
You better get out
of my face, all right?

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:44.477
What's up with Brandi?

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:47.855
- Hey, you a punk, man!
- Hey, yo, yo. Wait a minute.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.065
Wait a minute!

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:51.484
This is family business.
Let them fight.

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:54.737
Y'all are brothers!
You ain't supposed to be fighting.

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:57.281
You been a punk from day one.
Mama's boy!

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.075
Get him, Dough.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.829
Let them fight, man.

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:05.665
Brenda, Ricky and Doughboy
are out here fighting.

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:08.710
Hey, hey. Cut that out.
Get off of him.

01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:10.878
Get off of him!

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:12.630
Damn.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:14.924
- What you hit me for?
- You all right?

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:17.844
Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right!

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:25.601
What you hit me for?

01:24:25.853 --> 01:24:28.104
It's the test scores. Ricky!

01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:30.982
Ricky, baby, your test scores!

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:33.067
What you hit me for?

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:35.778
Why you hitting me?

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.948
Yo, Dough. Why she hit you?

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.825
Shut up, man.

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:44.370
Fuck all that shit.
I'm going into the fucking Army.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.457
- That's all there is to say.
- You're doing what?

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.584
Man, what are you, a damn fool?

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:52.295
They say I can learn
to work on computers.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.964
Plus, they'll give me
money for college.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:59.260
Listen to you.
You sound like the commercial.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.513
They don't tell you that
you don't belong to you no more.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:05.808
You belong to them,
the government.

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:08.144
Like a slave or something.

01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:10.605
My daddy told me a black man...

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:13.983
...has got no business, no place
in the white man's Army.

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:16.027
I heard all that.

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:18.154
I got a little boy to think about, okay?

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:22.283
I don't want to be like my brother.
Hanging out and not doing shit.

01:25:22.493 --> 01:25:24.786
End up dealing 'caine, just like him.

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:29.207
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.626
Listen, let me tell you something.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:34.629
When you join that Army,
you ain't gonna be nobody.

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:41.469
Yo, you got any change?

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.763
No, I ain't got no change. See?

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:45.848
What up?

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:54.190
Yo, chief. Here you go.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.110
Hey, no problem, bro.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:02.532
You win anything?

01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:06.494
Wait a minute, man.
I'm still trying to find out.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.959
Shit. Nothing.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:16.754
- What?
- I said nothing. I didn't win.

01:26:16.964 --> 01:26:19.006
You gotta be Mexican
to win that shit.

01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:23.344
Man, I win this lottery, I won't
have to worry about a damn thing.

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:28.599
Don't have to worry about no colleges,
no 700 on no SATs. Not a damn...

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.101
Look.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:36.816
There's that motherfucker
from the other night.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.071
Okay. When I say "cut,"
we'll cut through these houses.

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:45.867
Cut!

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.245
- Punk ass.
- Get him, man, get him!

01:26:49.496 --> 01:26:50.538
Let's get him.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:53.416
Go around the corner.
Cut them off. Come on, go!

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.127
Shit.

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.045
Fucking mangy mutts!

01:26:58.255 --> 01:26:59.297
Come on.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:01.132
I got you. I got you.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:03.885
- Come on, let's go.
- Hold on, man.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:07.555
- What are you doing?
- I gotta drain the weasel.

01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:15.938
If that motherfucker roll up on the set
one more time, I'll blast his ass.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.194
Shit! Rick!

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.157
What a relief and shit.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.785
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Let's split up.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:31.829
I don't think we should do that.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.957
I think it'd be better
if we're together.

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:39.462
Them fools ain't gonna do nothing.
They just showing out and shit.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:44.508
- I'll meet you at your house.
- Cool. I'm out of here.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.597
Come on, man.

01:28:26.093 --> 01:28:27.593
Ricky!

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:06.882
Ricky.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.930
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.224
Ricky!

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:20.104
Shit!

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.912
Watch his head. Don't hurt him.

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.458
Don't hurt him, man.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:45.671
Be careful with him.

01:29:58.477 --> 01:30:00.061
Watch his head.

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:01.937
He's dead.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.274
Let's take him home.

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:43.896
Mama!

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:50.319
No!

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:58.160
Ricky! Oh, my God, no!
Not Ricky!

01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:02.832
What y'all doing now?

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:05.334
Ricky?

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:07.419
Oh, my God.

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:13.050
Ricky? Ricky, baby, get up.

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.637
Get up. Wake up, baby.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:19.181
Ricky, get up. Get up.

01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:20.683
It's all right. Get up, baby.

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:22.226
Get up. Tre, what happened?

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.270
What happened to him?

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:27.690
Give me the baby.
Give me the baby!

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:30.609
Don't touch him!
Don't you ever touch him!

01:31:30.861 --> 01:31:33.279
He don't need to be seeing this!

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.990
Ricky, please wake up!

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:38.701
Mom.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:42.413
- What did you do? What did you do?
- It wasn't my fault.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.249
- What did you do?
- Mama, I didn't do nothing.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:48.210
I didn't do nothing.
I didn't do nothing.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:51.005
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?

01:31:51.882 --> 01:31:53.424
What did you do?

01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:58.512
What did you do? You did this!
You did this! I'll kill you!

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:03.893
You did it! I know you did it!
You did it! Yes, you did!

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.902
I told you!

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:20.159
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.994
Oh, my God!

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.830
Ricky, baby! Ricky!

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:28.959
Meet me at my house
in five minutes.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.513
Tre, what happened?

01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:44.475
- Talk to me. What happened?
- Go home.

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:46.685
- What happened to Ricky?
- Go home.

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:49.813
Talk to him.
Something happened to Rick!

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:53.108
I don't know. He just got shot.
Something happened to Rick!

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.988
Brandi, I want you to calm down and
I want you to go home. You hear me?

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.449
- You hear me?
- Yes.

01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:06.705
I'll take care of him.
He'll be all right.

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:10.542
Tre?

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.881
Tre, what are you doing?

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:27.142
Oh, you bad, now, huh?

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.479
You bad. You gotta shoot
somebody now, huh?

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:33.399
Well, here I am.

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:35.818
Come on, shoot me.

01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:39.863
You bad, right?

01:33:44.286 --> 01:33:46.120
Look, I'm sorry about your friend.

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:50.082
My heart goes out to his family,
but that's their problem.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.793
You my son. You my problem.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:56.964
I want you to give me the gun.

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:06.015
I see. You want to end up
like little Chris in a wheelchair?

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:10.853
Right? No, no, you want to end up
like Doughboy, huh? No?

01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:14.940
Give me the motherfucking gun, Tre!

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:42.009
You're my only son, and I'm not gonna
lose you to no bullshit, you hear?

01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:46.221
I love you, man.

01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:59.109
Go clean yourself up.

01:35:01.154 --> 01:35:02.446
Go on.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:40.317
Tre.

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:42.277
Tre!

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:49.618
Damn.

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:55.332
Shit!

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:36.748
Yeah.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:51.388
Let me out.

01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:02.357
Dough...

01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:05.068
...let me out.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:59.289
Where these motherfuckers at, man?
Been out here damn near three hours.

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:02.376
It's colder than a motherfucker
out here too.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:04.628
Let's go eat.

01:38:05.505 --> 01:38:06.755
Cool.

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:15.722
When you gonna get your hair cut?
It look like something from 1983.

01:38:15.974 --> 01:38:17.599
Ain't nobody cutting my hair.

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:20.185
I'm like Samson.
My strength is in my head.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:23.272
What's up with the babe
you been talking to?

01:38:23.523 --> 01:38:25.148
- Fuck that bitch.
- You scared?

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.485
- He ain't scared, he just young.
- And dumb.

01:38:28.945 --> 01:38:30.904
I'm putting ketchup on this.

01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:32.823
Why you put all that ketchup on it?

01:38:33.032 --> 01:38:36.368
Why you worried about it, fool?
These my fries.

01:38:41.124 --> 01:38:43.292
We going to see your girl?

01:38:43.543 --> 01:38:45.794
No, I'm going to see my girl.
You going home.

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:48.046
There they go, right there.

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:50.340
Turn off the lights.

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.843
Hit the lights, nigga.

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:55.387
Take your ass home
and watch some videos.

01:38:55.638 --> 01:38:57.306
Home with your mama.

01:39:03.646 --> 01:39:05.564
Check that motherfucker out.

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.194
- Shit!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:13.697
Don't follow me. Go your own way.

01:39:26.169 --> 01:39:28.754
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck you doing?

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:31.548
This motherfucker's crazy!

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:35.218
Goddamn, man. And I'm on parole.
Ain't this about a bitch!

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:36.887
What the fuck you doing?

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.222
Shit!

01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:41.642
Yo, Dough. Let's bail, man.

01:39:41.893 --> 01:39:43.810
- Let's go, man!
- Come on, nigga, now!

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:47.314
Man, what the fuck?

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:50.734
Oh, shit!

01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:54.363
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, man. Let's go!

01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:01.870
Fuck you, man!

01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:03.955
Fuck you!

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:08.043
Turn your punk ass over.

01:40:14.217 --> 01:40:18.011
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't pull the fucking trigger.

01:40:18.805 --> 01:40:20.639
What the fuck you doing?

01:40:20.932 --> 01:40:22.516
Come on, man.

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:24.017
Well, fuck you!

01:40:28.898 --> 01:40:30.649
Dough, let's bail, man.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:32.109
Man, let's move!

01:40:32.318 --> 01:40:34.194
- Let's go!
- What the fuck you doing?

01:40:34.404 --> 01:40:36.738
- Let's bail, man!
- Let's go, man!

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:39.199
Come on, nigga, let's bail!

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:43.161
Damn! Come on!

01:40:44.247 --> 01:40:46.707
Shit, let's get out of here.

01:40:46.916 --> 01:40:49.209
Here come the fucking police.

01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:52.337
Get your ass in.

01:40:52.839 --> 01:40:55.090
Let's get the fuck up out of here.

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:30.412
What's up?

01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:36.668
Yo, coz.

01:43:37.879 --> 01:43:41.089
I know why you got
out of the car last night.

01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:45.218
You shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:48.763
You don't want that shit
to come back to haunt you.

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:57.314
I ain't been up this early
in a long time.

01:44:01.861 --> 01:44:03.904
Turned on the TV this morning.

01:44:06.449 --> 01:44:08.575
Had this shit on about...

01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:13.163
About living in a violent world.

01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:18.001
Showed all these foreign places.

01:44:19.503 --> 01:44:21.671
How foreigners live and all.

01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:26.301
I started thinking, man.

01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:31.097
Either they don't know...

01:44:32.433 --> 01:44:34.225
...don't show...

01:44:36.354 --> 01:44:39.230
...or don't care about
what's going on in the 'hood.

01:44:44.528 --> 01:44:46.863
They had all this foreign shit.

01:44:47.823 --> 01:44:50.241
They didn't have shit
on my brother, man.

01:44:59.752 --> 01:45:01.962
I ain't got no brother.

01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:16.768
Got no mother, neither.

01:45:20.398 --> 01:45:23.233
She loved that fool
more than she love me.

01:45:23.693 --> 01:45:25.235
Doughboy.

01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:27.988
You got some blow? Got some rock?

01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:30.323
Get the fuck out of my face!

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:35.745
Keep them goddamn babies
out the street.

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:41.376
Did y'all get them?

01:45:53.139 --> 01:45:56.391
I don't even know
how I feel about it neither, man.

01:45:58.477 --> 01:46:01.396
Shit just goes on and on, you know.

01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:06.818
Next thing you know,
somebody might try to smoke me.

01:46:11.449 --> 01:46:13.074
Don't matter, though.

01:46:15.453 --> 01:46:18.079
We all gotta go sometime, huh?

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:26.629
Seem like they punched
the wrong clock on Rick, though.

01:46:30.134 --> 01:46:31.426
Yeah.

01:46:33.512 --> 01:46:35.597
I gotta go, coz.

01:46:38.934 --> 01:46:40.226
Hey, Dough.

01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:43.813
What's up?

01:46:50.696 --> 01:46:52.822
You still got one brother left, man.

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.034
Thanks, man.

01:47:00.039 --> 01:47:01.206
- Later, G.
- Later.
