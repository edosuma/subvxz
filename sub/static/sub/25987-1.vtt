00:29.206 --> 00:32.073
So if I'm gonna write
an article about this,

00:32.076 --> 00:33.276
I need the background.

00:33.278 --> 00:34.811
Why?

00:34.813 --> 00:36.913
Sometimes you
gotta stick your hand

00:36.915 --> 00:38.815
in the hornet's nest
to get a reaction.

00:38.817 --> 00:40.817
Sounds like you're asking
to get stung.

00:40.819 --> 00:43.085
No. We're smart and quick.

00:43.087 --> 00:46.222
Wenoco Corp, a Fortune 500.

00:46.224 --> 00:48.725
Their marketing slogan is,
"making life better."

00:48.727 --> 00:51.060
Then why did they just
buy themselves

00:51.062 --> 00:53.630
out of a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit?

00:53.632 --> 00:56.399
Assholes dumped
30 metric tons of toxic waste

00:56.401 --> 00:57.800
into the Indian Ocean.

00:57.802 --> 00:59.702
Thought nobody would notice.

00:59.704 --> 01:02.038
Then all those dead whales
start washing up,

01:02.040 --> 01:04.206
and instant PR nightmare.

01:04.209 --> 01:07.176
Yeah, until they
made the story disappear.

01:07.178 --> 01:09.312
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

01:09.314 --> 01:11.114
We're gonna
make the world notice.

01:11.116 --> 01:13.984
I thought this was
all about urban exploration.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.854
Discovering places
you weren't supposed to go.

01:16.856 --> 01:19.355
Shit! Oh, shit.

01:19.357 --> 01:22.026
Shit...

01:22.028 --> 01:24.728
You trying to give
a dude a heart attack?

01:24.730 --> 01:27.163
Billy, we good to go?

01:27.165 --> 01:28.866
Yeah, I'm through
the firewall.

01:28.868 --> 01:30.768
Two minutes to bust
the encryption.

01:30.770 --> 01:32.201
Sam the rebel.

01:32.203 --> 01:34.972
Well, till I brought him
a social conscience.

01:34.974 --> 01:36.874
So that makes
break-and-enter okay?

01:36.876 --> 01:38.642
It's not B and E
if we don't steal

01:38.644 --> 01:40.010
and nobody gets hurt.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.347
Yeah, and if they
leave the door open.

02:05.871 --> 02:09.372
All right, three minutes,
in and out. Let's go.

02:09.375 --> 02:12.876
Jade, the only people
who could get hurt are you.

02:12.878 --> 02:15.045
Is exposing the truth
worth that or jail?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.916
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

03:11.071 --> 03:12.736
What now? It's locked.

03:12.738 --> 03:16.007
- How are we gonna...?
- Access card.

03:16.009 --> 03:17.675
Where did you get that?

03:17.677 --> 03:20.511
Wenoco Corp junior analyst
with a taste for tequila.

03:20.513 --> 03:22.047
Shameless.

03:22.049 --> 03:24.015
Love 'em and
leave 'em, Sam, right?

03:24.017 --> 03:27.018
Hey, that was the old me.
I'm a changed man now.

03:27.020 --> 03:28.953
Mm-hm. Okay.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.493
Help me!

03:51.111 --> 03:53.645
Okay, tie it off to the edge.

03:53.647 --> 03:55.747
We got a minute,
20 till we book.

03:55.749 --> 03:57.347
Then the alarm resets after.

03:57.349 --> 04:00.585
All this just to put a banner
on the side of a building?

04:00.587 --> 04:02.420
What does that even get you?

04:02.422 --> 04:04.355
It makes the evening news.

04:04.357 --> 04:05.757
You feel that rush?

04:12.899 --> 04:15.834
- Billy, you said...
- Yeah, well, shit happens.

04:15.836 --> 04:18.204
- Come on.
- Okay, ready?

04:18.206 --> 04:19.536
Whoo! Ha, ha!

04:19.539 --> 04:21.341
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.201
Yeah.

04:49.203 --> 04:51.203
Whoo! Hey, way too close.

04:51.205 --> 04:53.406
Mm, but we're here,
aren't we?

04:55.042 --> 04:58.476
They're calling it an act
of ecoterrorism.

04:58.478 --> 05:00.112
Mom would be pissed.

05:00.114 --> 05:02.081
What? Because
she raised us better?

05:02.083 --> 05:05.217
She wanted women
who were strong and opinionated.

05:05.219 --> 05:08.286
- Who broke the law?
- Who defied authority.

05:08.288 --> 05:10.890
Come on. Tell me you don't think
this is justified.

05:10.892 --> 05:12.691
Oh, and one hell of a rush.

05:12.693 --> 05:14.794
I've gotta call my editor.

05:14.796 --> 05:17.562
Tell him I've got
the inside track on this.

05:17.564 --> 05:19.799
Hey, no names
in your BuzzFeed story,

05:19.801 --> 05:20.933
okay, Alice?

05:20.935 --> 05:22.601
Much as I'd like
to be infamous,

05:22.603 --> 05:26.304
I'll settle for
"unknown Robin Hood rock star."

05:26.306 --> 05:29.675
Your secret's safe with me.
I protect all my sources.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.244
- Even the arrogant ones.
- Oh.

05:33.948 --> 05:37.016
Oh, man. I'm gonna miss
the hell out of this.

05:37.018 --> 05:38.651
Miss it? Why?

05:38.653 --> 05:41.987
Ask your sister, Jade.
Or should I call her "Yoko"?

05:41.989 --> 05:44.123
Okay, I'm not
breaking up the band.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.826
It's just... It's time, okay?

05:46.828 --> 05:50.496
Sooner or later, we're gonna
face the consequences.

05:50.498 --> 05:52.965
If we are planning on
hanging it up,

05:52.967 --> 05:54.934
at least we're gonna
go out on top.

05:54.936 --> 05:57.136
On top of what?

05:57.138 --> 05:59.939
There's a ranking system.

05:59.941 --> 06:03.209
Each new place we get to first,
we get to drop a pin.

06:03.211 --> 06:06.047
- Wenoco is 32.
- Boom.

06:07.481 --> 06:11.150
So I guess this
really is the end.

06:11.152 --> 06:12.918
So that's why you called.

06:12.920 --> 06:17.022
You wanted me
to write your final chapter.

06:17.024 --> 06:19.458
- Our obituary.
- Okay, we're not dead, Spencer.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.694
I want us to shift
into legitimate advocacies.

06:21.696 --> 06:24.630
Yes. Petitions and rallies.
It's edgy.

06:26.068 --> 06:28.034
Oh, come on.
You're forgetting one thing.

06:28.036 --> 06:30.569
Going legit,
it ain't free.

06:30.571 --> 06:33.342
Hey, guys,
you're gonna wanna see this.

06:35.376 --> 06:37.043
Who is that?

06:37.045 --> 06:40.347
Dane, Sam's old
partner and grade-A asshole.

06:40.349 --> 06:42.182
We don't have
to watch this.

06:42.184 --> 06:45.818
You know what, it's okay.
I wanna see it. Play it, Billy.

06:45.820 --> 06:48.387
<i>Sammy, I just saw the news.</i>

06:48.389 --> 06:51.157
<i>Wenoco tower.
That's a nice get.</i>

06:51.159 --> 06:53.360
<i>I guess it's your last stab</i>

06:53.362 --> 06:54.961
<i>at claiming real territory.</i>

06:54.963 --> 06:57.831
<i>Seriously, come on.
Are the rumors true?</i>

06:57.833 --> 07:00.466
<i>You're punking out
of urban crusades.</i>

07:00.468 --> 07:03.569
<i>Look, I know love is blind
and all that crap.</i>

07:03.571 --> 07:06.273
<i>But are you gonna let
Jade change you like that?</i>

07:06.275 --> 07:07.908
Okay, you know what,
turn it off.

07:07.910 --> 07:11.278
No, let him finish.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.681
<i>I mean, it's who you are, man.
It's in the blood.</i>

07:14.683 --> 07:17.516
<i>I mean, I know that
and so do you.</i>

07:17.518 --> 07:20.020
<i>That's why I'm gonna
lay down one last challenge.</i>

07:20.022 --> 07:23.156
<i>Let's settle who's really
king of this mountain.</i>

07:23.158 --> 07:24.758
<i>I've sent you a geotag.</i>

07:24.760 --> 07:26.893
<i>It's a place we both missed.</i>

07:26.895 --> 07:28.528
<i>Until now.</i>

07:28.530 --> 07:32.198
<i>Trust me, this could be
a hell of a place.</i>

07:32.200 --> 07:35.201
<i>More to the point, this one's
coming with a bounty.</i>

07:35.203 --> 07:37.304
<i>A private donor
is offering 100 grand</i>

07:37.306 --> 07:39.105
<i>to whoever gets there first.</i>

07:39.107 --> 07:40.774
<i>So the question is:</i>

07:40.776 --> 07:42.776
<i>"You got the stones
for one last quest?"</i>

07:42.778 --> 07:45.445
<i>A real jackpot.</i>

07:45.447 --> 07:47.881
<i>Or are you
gonna call it a day?</i>

07:47.883 --> 07:49.249
<i>Your call, buddy.</i>

07:49.251 --> 07:51.017
Yo, hey, gauntlet thrown.

07:51.019 --> 07:53.520
He just went all in.
A hundred grand.

07:53.522 --> 07:57.190
Shut up. We don't even know
if this is legit or where he is.

07:57.192 --> 08:00.126
Just let it go. He's trying
to get a rise out of you.

08:00.128 --> 08:02.229
Okay, but the money.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.934
- Dude, seriously?
- We're done, right? Right?

08:23.152 --> 08:25.286
You people are
out of your minds.

08:25.288 --> 08:27.288
The place you wanna go?
It's off-limits.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.723
Everybody knows that.
It's not even on the map.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.993
You sure you know
what you're getting into?

08:31.995 --> 08:34.328
- They took it off Google Earth.
- "They"?

08:34.330 --> 08:36.864
Government, secret business
cabals, who knows?

08:36.866 --> 08:40.633
There's like 28 sites
in the world blacked out.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.436
Area 51, SzÃ¡zhalombatta.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.272
Places people aren't
supposed to know too much about.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.974
Places with dirty,
little secrets.

08:46.976 --> 08:48.708
All I know is
the lake's poison.

08:48.710 --> 08:51.479
Some big toxic spill
20-something years back.

08:51.481 --> 08:54.647
Radiation or some shit.
Big fences, warning signs.

08:54.649 --> 08:56.384
Unless you believe
it isn't true.

08:56.386 --> 08:59.053
You're crazy
to wanna go in there.

08:59.055 --> 09:02.690
We received some information
from a friend.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.358
Sam, the more I look at it,

09:04.360 --> 09:07.128
the more it doesn't seem like
there's a mine at all.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.797
It seems like this place
never existed.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.167
Maybe, if this friend
isn't exactly a friend anymore.

09:13.169 --> 09:15.970
That's because he ain't
nobody's friend. Traitor.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.538
He found something
that suggests

09:17.540 --> 09:19.774
that you locals...
You've been lied to.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.842
Could be you're the one
chasing a lie.

09:21.844 --> 09:24.178
Like I said, some people
can't be trusted.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.113
- "Some"?
- I've known this guy forever.

09:26.115 --> 09:28.949
He wouldn't have challenged us
if there wasn't something.

09:28.951 --> 09:30.651
Yeah, like 100 grand.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.187
- It's not on the map.
- Here's what I know.

09:33.189 --> 09:35.222
Me and Travis aren't
getting paid enough

09:35.224 --> 09:36.724
to walk into a hot zone.

09:36.726 --> 09:38.025
Yeah, that's right.

09:38.027 --> 09:39.760
I don't care if this friend

09:39.762 --> 09:41.363
got his intel
from God himself.

09:41.365 --> 09:43.898
This thing picks up
even a tiny bit

09:43.900 --> 09:45.800
of radiation, we're out.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.888
- Well?
- Decoys.

10:07.890 --> 10:10.225
There's no service coming from
those cameras,

10:10.227 --> 10:11.826
not even an energy source.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.828
Somebody put them
up to scare people.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.263
Maybe for good reason.

10:15.265 --> 10:18.533
Or, heh, somebody just
got here before us.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.435
You think?

10:20.437 --> 10:21.572
I don't know.

10:23.006 --> 10:24.339
And?

10:24.341 --> 10:26.577
Give it a goddamn second,
would you?

10:29.113 --> 10:31.346
See? I told you.

10:31.348 --> 10:33.614
No radiation.
The story's bullshit.

10:33.616 --> 10:34.950
One part.

10:34.952 --> 10:36.684
But something in here
is dangerous.

10:36.686 --> 10:38.887
Otherwise, why all this?

10:38.889 --> 10:40.789
I need video
for the online article.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.457
Hey. Whoa, whoa. Come on. No.

10:42.459 --> 10:44.893
Hey, it's okay. You're gonna
blur our faces,

10:44.895 --> 10:47.628
- alter our voices, right?
- Sure, whatever you want.

10:47.630 --> 10:50.799
I get it.
Band of anonymous rebels.

10:50.801 --> 10:53.635
All right, go for it.
Rolling?

10:53.637 --> 10:55.403
Okay, we're here.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.608
Twenty-five years ago, this
place was poisoned by chemicals.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.176
So they say,
but there's been no EPA cleanup

11:01.178 --> 11:03.411
and no public record
of any activity here.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.913
So something doesn't add up,

11:04.915 --> 11:07.249
and we're gonna figure out
what it is.

11:09.286 --> 11:10.586
- Cool?
- Cool.

11:10.588 --> 11:12.387
My editor's
gonna love this.

11:12.389 --> 11:14.055
Look, maybe she's right.

11:14.057 --> 11:15.790
This place could still be
dangerous.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.792
It isn't. I got a feeling.

11:17.794 --> 11:20.228
What, because Dane said?

11:20.230 --> 11:22.898
He uncovered this place.
Didn't he? He dared us...

11:22.900 --> 11:24.500
Yeah, exactly, a dare.

11:24.502 --> 11:27.169
What if this place
and the bounty is another hoax?

11:27.171 --> 11:29.472
One more way for Dane
to get back at you.

11:29.474 --> 11:32.408
- Who's Dane?
- Long story.

11:32.410 --> 11:35.143
Let's just say they had
a falling out.

11:35.145 --> 11:37.580
- My sister.
- Dane wasn't a fan?

11:37.582 --> 11:39.515
Oh, he was a little more
than her fan.

11:39.517 --> 11:41.384
Well there's only one way
to find out.

11:41.386 --> 11:43.619
- You bring the bolt cutters?
- Yeah.

11:43.621 --> 11:46.955
Hey, whoa, isn't that illegal?
You okay with this, Penny?

11:46.957 --> 11:50.193
We're hired hands. If they wanna
be rebels and break the law,

11:50.195 --> 11:51.627
it's on them.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.231
Hey, watch out, man.

11:54.831 --> 11:56.666
Watch out.
The fence is dangerous.

11:56.668 --> 11:58.067
No!

11:58.069 --> 11:59.868
No! Help him!

11:59.870 --> 12:01.903
- No, no! Help him!
- No!

12:05.476 --> 12:07.709
Oh, boy.

12:07.711 --> 12:09.645
The look on your face
was priceless.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.180
He thought you were dying.

12:11.182 --> 12:13.015
Chill, Furiosa.

12:13.017 --> 12:15.351
There's no current.
You can feel that up close.

12:15.353 --> 12:18.354
It's not my first rodeo,
okay?

12:18.356 --> 12:20.957
Doesn't add up. Found
a dead deer here a month back.

12:20.959 --> 12:23.059
It burned to a crisp
touching that.

12:23.061 --> 12:25.995
Yeah, well, it's the fence
that's dead now. I'm telling you

12:25.997 --> 12:28.464
this whole place is a lie.

13:12.645 --> 13:14.745
No contamination here.

13:14.747 --> 13:17.113
Somebody went through
a hell of a lot of trouble

13:17.115 --> 13:19.349
to make this
look like ground zero.

13:19.351 --> 13:21.083
It's gotta be something else,
right?

13:21.085 --> 13:23.620
Something bigger. Come on.

13:23.622 --> 13:25.722
Tell me you're not
just a little curious.

13:25.724 --> 13:27.391
She was never cut out
for this.

13:27.393 --> 13:29.892
Thinks it's juvenile,
not noble enough.

13:29.894 --> 13:32.464
Nothing wrong with having
a higher purpose.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.767
You and I could have
a purpose.

13:36.769 --> 13:38.801
Get a little high,
see where it leads.

13:38.803 --> 13:40.404
Really, Spence?

13:40.406 --> 13:42.739
After all these years,
you figured I'd give up

13:42.741 --> 13:44.807
my self-respect
for a shot at you?

13:44.809 --> 13:46.643
You don't know
what you're missing.

13:46.645 --> 13:48.178
Pretty sure I do.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.247
Come... Really?

13:50.249 --> 13:51.481
Come on.

13:51.483 --> 13:53.417
All right, easy, easy.
Let's go.

13:53.419 --> 13:55.054
All right.

13:59.658 --> 14:01.992
Guys, would you look at that?

14:01.994 --> 14:03.327
Yeah, it's stunning.

14:03.329 --> 14:05.195
Yeah, and this thing's heavy.

14:05.197 --> 14:07.931
Easy, snowflake. Wouldn't want
you breaking a nail.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.168
Okay, here's good.

14:12.604 --> 14:15.505
Drop our banner and get out.

14:15.507 --> 14:18.675
Hey, careful with that.
That gear's sensitive.

14:18.677 --> 14:20.780
Okay. Okay.

14:23.282 --> 14:25.482
We're losing signal,
so we should get moving.

14:25.484 --> 14:27.250
Satellite phone's
still working.

14:27.252 --> 14:29.319
I should be able
to triangulate the geotag

14:29.321 --> 14:32.324
to within a few feet.
We're good.

14:41.634 --> 14:44.868
Look, it's the last time,
I promise.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.205
Mm-hm.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.896
Hey, this water's warm.

15:12.898 --> 15:14.199
It's like a hot tub.

15:22.675 --> 15:25.576
Okay, so we got
EPIRB sat link,

15:25.578 --> 15:27.845
rations and camping supplies
for three days.

15:27.847 --> 15:30.314
Well, we might not even
have to spend the night,

15:30.316 --> 15:33.484
depending on what we find.

15:33.486 --> 15:36.087
âª Row, row, row your boat âª

15:36.089 --> 15:38.656
âª Gently up the lake âª

15:38.658 --> 15:42.860
âª Who knows what we're gonna find
Your old friend Dane's a snake âª

15:42.862 --> 15:44.328
Shut up, Spencer.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.199
Whatever you
say, little man.

15:48.835 --> 15:52.403
- Did you guys see...?
- Land ho!

15:55.108 --> 15:56.443
Whoo!

16:03.316 --> 16:04.984
There we go.

16:06.719 --> 16:10.488
For a tiny Podunk lake,
it's not messing around.

16:10.490 --> 16:12.256
All that machinery?

16:12.258 --> 16:16.494
Maybe it's used to move cargo
to a bigger facility.

16:16.496 --> 16:17.995
Maybe inland.

16:17.997 --> 16:21.365
- Yeah, but what kind of facility?
- Hey.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.802
You're breaking the law.
If it's all the same,

16:23.804 --> 16:26.304
we're gonna unload your gear
and get the hell out.

16:26.306 --> 16:28.105
Um, you can't take off.

16:28.107 --> 16:31.075
We were only paid to guide
you in and pick you up later.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.145
Will you give us at least
an hour to look around. Cool?

16:34.147 --> 16:35.948
You got 30 minutes.

16:35.950 --> 16:39.319
I'm not getting paid enough
to risk jail for trespassing.

16:41.755 --> 16:43.956
What went so wrong
they abandoned the thing?

16:43.958 --> 16:45.924
I mean, the signs, the fences?

16:45.926 --> 16:48.760
Well, Dane said he found
something incredible, didn't he?

16:48.762 --> 16:51.797
- Think he beat us to the pin?
- Only one way to find out.

17:30.104 --> 17:32.339
- Let's go!
- All right. Okay.

17:49.189 --> 17:52.558
Well, I
guess that answers that.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.726
That sure as hell looks like
Dane's shit.

17:54.728 --> 17:58.263
Yeah. Sam, we just got suckered.
Dane beat us to it.

17:58.265 --> 17:59.598
Yeah.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.099
We've been set up.

18:01.101 --> 18:02.734
What an asshole.

18:02.736 --> 18:05.437
Okay, Dane. Where
the hell are you?

18:05.439 --> 18:06.875
What now?

18:09.610 --> 18:11.046
I don't know.

18:16.116 --> 18:18.885
Hey, guys, you
should see this.

18:18.887 --> 18:20.588
Quick.

18:53.755 --> 18:56.556
Guys. This is Dane's camera.

18:56.558 --> 18:58.256
We need to find out
what happened.

18:58.258 --> 19:00.093
Billy, can you access
what's on here?

19:00.095 --> 19:02.395
Yeah. I've got an app
on my phone.

19:02.397 --> 19:04.299
I can access it
via Bluetooth.

19:07.402 --> 19:10.570
There's only a couple
of files.

19:10.572 --> 19:11.840
Here.

19:13.308 --> 19:15.074
<i>That thing on, Gomez?</i>

19:15.076 --> 19:16.976
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

19:16.978 --> 19:19.345
<i>We're here.
According to our guide,</i>

19:19.347 --> 19:21.347
<i>Henderson,
the entrance isn't far.</i>

19:21.349 --> 19:24.118
<i>About 200 yards
up this hill.</i>

19:24.120 --> 19:27.153
<i>He went up ahead,
make sure everything's safe.</i>

19:27.155 --> 19:29.222
<i>Man, if he's telling
the truth,</i>

19:29.224 --> 19:31.624
<i>this is gonna be
one hell of a find...</i>

19:31.626 --> 19:34.827
<i>and one hell of a payday.
Ha, ha.</i>

19:34.829 --> 19:37.296
"Henderson."
That name mean anything to you?

19:37.298 --> 19:39.298
No. I know Gomez.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.969
He was part of the crew
Dane acquired after we parted.

19:41.971 --> 19:45.271
- I never heard of Henderson.
- Telling the truth about what?

19:45.273 --> 19:47.007
Is there anything else
on here, man?

19:47.009 --> 19:49.676
Only one other file.

19:49.678 --> 19:54.280
<i>It wasn't supposed to be here.
Not alive, anyway. We got...</i>

19:54.282 --> 19:57.951
<i>We got attacked
while we were sleeping.</i>

19:57.953 --> 19:59.853
<i>I think Bonita is dead.</i>

19:59.855 --> 20:02.022
<i>Gomez... Gomez ran off.</i>

20:02.024 --> 20:05.025
<i>I'm pretty sure it got him too.</i>

20:05.027 --> 20:07.627
<i>Henderson said there was
weapons inside this place.</i>

20:07.629 --> 20:09.697
<i>I hope he finds them.</i>

20:09.699 --> 20:11.732
<i>Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my...</i>

20:13.401 --> 20:16.003
<i>I don't think I'm gonna
make it off this island.</i>

20:16.005 --> 20:20.140
<i>If anyone finds this,
please tell my family that I...</i>

20:20.142 --> 20:23.242
<i>That I am sorry,
that I love them.</i>

20:25.014 --> 20:26.547
Dude, what was that?

20:26.549 --> 20:28.682
Maybe this island
isn't abandoned.

20:28.684 --> 20:30.349
What if someone's still here?

20:30.351 --> 20:33.286
Some hillbilly psycho
with an ax to grind, literally.

20:33.288 --> 20:37.391
Okay, guys, the video said
"something," not "someone."

20:37.393 --> 20:40.360
Not a person. Something
that shouldn't be alive.

20:40.362 --> 20:41.395
What does that mean?

20:41.397 --> 20:43.165
I have no idea.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.168
Dude.

20:49.338 --> 20:53.307
Shit. Wait, is that...?

20:53.309 --> 20:55.743
It looks like something
has been ripped apart.

20:55.745 --> 20:58.378
Don't you get it?
What this thing is?

20:58.380 --> 21:01.182
- Apparently, you do.
- Yeah, Dane and his crew.

21:01.184 --> 21:03.450
Look, they cooked this up.
We're being punked.

21:03.452 --> 21:06.420
- What are you talking about?
- Think about it, brains.

21:06.422 --> 21:09.190
The torn-up camp, the blood,
the terrifying video?

21:09.192 --> 21:10.858
It's a setup, man.

21:10.860 --> 21:14.027
Jade called it. He's out to make
you look like a fool.

21:14.029 --> 21:15.629
There ain't no 100 grand.

21:15.631 --> 21:17.865
He's probably out there
filming us right now.

21:17.867 --> 21:21.602
Hey, Dane! Come on out, bro!
Jig's up. I'm not your bitch!

21:21.604 --> 21:23.804
He's right.
It's gotta be a hoax. Right?

21:23.806 --> 21:26.774
- You know what he's like.
- Dane!

21:26.776 --> 21:29.643
All right. I'm wandering off
into the woods

21:29.645 --> 21:31.445
after your scary blood trail.

21:31.447 --> 21:33.580
- What's gonna happen? No.
- Spencer!

21:33.582 --> 21:37.551
- Spencer, wait, man!
- No, man!

21:37.553 --> 21:39.222
Spencer!

21:40.589 --> 21:41.856
- Spence!
- No.

21:41.858 --> 21:44.125
And nice homage
to classic horror, bro.

21:44.127 --> 21:46.895
The whole shaky
handheld-camera thing.

21:46.897 --> 21:49.530
Hey, the flaring nostrils
of fear.

21:49.532 --> 21:51.398
Yo, come on out, Dane!

21:51.400 --> 21:53.502
I'm not getting played
by you.

21:55.571 --> 21:58.472
What makes tracks like that?
A bear?

21:58.474 --> 22:00.742
No, a bear doesn't
have feet that big.

22:00.744 --> 22:04.112
Oh, come on, people.
It's obvious. Dane.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.647
I don't know.

22:05.649 --> 22:08.482
- Billy?
- Looks pretty real to me.

22:08.484 --> 22:12.086
Some sort of quadruped
with a tail.

22:12.088 --> 22:15.156
- What?
- They look reptilian.

22:15.158 --> 22:16.660
Dude.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.528
Well, maybe they're
yeti tracks.

22:20.530 --> 22:24.098
Or the Loch Ness monster?
Hold me, Billy, I'm frightened.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.600
Could you be
a bigger asshole?

22:25.602 --> 22:27.334
- Touch me again.
- Get your hands off.

22:27.336 --> 22:30.305
They should film me ripping
your head off. That'll go viral.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.040
Spence! Easy.

22:32.042 --> 22:33.675
- Just...
- Enough.

22:33.677 --> 22:35.910
Hey, Spencer.
You're bleeding.

22:35.912 --> 22:38.181
It's that damn fake blood!

22:42.185 --> 22:43.918
Oh, God!

22:55.599 --> 22:57.765
- Okay.
- It's Gomez.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.301
No, it's not real.

22:59.303 --> 23:02.670
No. No, it's not real.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.973
Look, this is Gomez
messing with our head.

23:04.975 --> 23:06.808
Right? That's all this is!

23:06.810 --> 23:09.044
We need to get out of here.

23:09.046 --> 23:11.813
Everybody back to the boat!

23:11.815 --> 23:13.084
Move!

23:15.219 --> 23:17.518
- Hey! Hey!
- What's going on?

23:17.520 --> 23:18.887
Start the boat!

23:18.889 --> 23:20.923
Start the boat!
Start the damn boat!

23:20.925 --> 23:22.324
What's going on?

23:22.326 --> 23:24.159
What about
Dane and the others?

23:24.161 --> 23:27.062
To hell with Dane. You wanna get
killed by what got Gomez?

23:27.064 --> 23:29.164
- What are you talking about?
- Get to safety.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.100
- We'll call police...
- They could be alive.

23:31.102 --> 23:34.036
Tell me what's going on
or nobody's setting foot on...

23:34.038 --> 23:36.638
The boat. It just moved.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.046
Pennie!

23:44.048 --> 23:45.682
Help!

23:48.418 --> 23:49.818
- Oh, my God!
- Shit. Pennie!

23:49.820 --> 23:51.956
I'm coming to get you!

23:55.693 --> 23:57.726
Pennie!

23:58.829 --> 23:59.862
Pennie!

23:59.864 --> 24:01.098
It's on my leg!

24:03.267 --> 24:05.834
- My leg. Oh, my leg.
- Pennie!

24:05.836 --> 24:07.138
Pennie!

24:08.973 --> 24:10.438
Pennie!

24:10.440 --> 24:13.577
- I'm coming to get you!
- Wait, Pennie. Wait.

24:14.812 --> 24:17.414
- I can't start it!
- Sam!

24:17.416 --> 24:19.114
Come on.

24:19.116 --> 24:21.617
Come on.

24:21.619 --> 24:24.620
- Travis, jump out.
- Travis, come on.

24:24.622 --> 24:27.723
- Travis, jump!
- I got you.

24:27.725 --> 24:29.124
Travis!

24:41.472 --> 24:43.308
- Travis!
- Shit.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.082
Swim, swim!

25:07.232 --> 25:10.200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:10.202 --> 25:12.701
Where did he go?
Where did he go?

25:12.703 --> 25:15.307
- Where did he go?
- Travis!

25:17.442 --> 25:19.077
- Get back here!
- Swim! Swim!

25:20.846 --> 25:22.312
Travis!

25:22.314 --> 25:23.849
- Swim! Swim!
- Travis!

25:27.352 --> 25:28.985
Spencer!

25:28.987 --> 25:30.222
Get back here, Sam!

25:33.524 --> 25:35.027
Pennie's okay.

25:36.795 --> 25:38.627
- Sam!
- Swim, swim!

25:38.629 --> 25:41.833
- Spence! Help me.
- All right.

25:43.035 --> 25:44.535
- Careful.
- I know, I know.

25:46.605 --> 25:48.138
Oh, shit.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.773
Travis, did you see him?

25:49.775 --> 25:51.508
- I don't think he's...
- Oh, God!

25:51.510 --> 25:53.045
It's all right.
It's all right.

25:54.146 --> 25:56.279
- Sit her down.
- Shit.

25:56.281 --> 25:58.014
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.183
You're gonna be okay.
We'll wrap it up.

26:00.185 --> 26:03.119
- Don't look at it. Look at me.
- I'm okay.

26:03.121 --> 26:05.388
What happened to Travis?
Did you see him?

26:05.390 --> 26:08.193
- He's gone, Pennie. He's gone.
- Oh, God, no. Oh, God.

26:09.628 --> 26:10.827
Hey, hey, hey.

26:10.829 --> 26:12.662
He is dead. You saw that.

26:12.664 --> 26:14.998
Look, something pulled
that whole boat under.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.599
What was that? A shark?

26:16.601 --> 26:20.070
- Not in a freshwater lake.
- Then tell me what that was!

26:20.072 --> 26:21.771
We need to get off this dock.

26:21.773 --> 26:24.408
What happened to Travis?
Go, search for him.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.444
Sam, we got nothing now.
No supplies.

26:26.446 --> 26:28.412
No beacon to get off
this island.

26:28.414 --> 26:30.548
We got no way out of here.

26:30.550 --> 26:33.151
You can help me lift her.
Help me lift her!

26:34.353 --> 26:36.586
- Just keep it...
- Oh, okay.

26:36.588 --> 26:39.722
- Watch your head. One, two...
- Careful, guys.

26:39.724 --> 26:41.891
- Stay with me now.
- Okay.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.795
Come on, guys. Quick.

26:53.106 --> 26:56.940
All right. I got her, I got her.
Okay. Shh.

26:56.942 --> 26:59.343
- Okay.
- What was that?

26:59.345 --> 27:01.547
This is bad. We lost all
our medical supplies.

27:01.713 --> 27:03.080
We gotta find something.

27:03.082 --> 27:04.515
We gotta stop the bleeding,

27:04.517 --> 27:06.283
- or she's gonna go into shock.
- Okay.

27:06.285 --> 27:08.618
- You guys find anything?
- I got nothing.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.554
- Flashlight.
- Ropes and whiskey.

27:10.556 --> 27:12.022
Yeah, well,
bring it all here.

27:12.024 --> 27:13.723
You have to pour this
on the wound.

27:13.725 --> 27:15.593
It's gonna hurt.

27:15.595 --> 27:18.129
- You're okay.
- It's starting to get dark.

27:18.131 --> 27:21.664
We've got maybe an hour or two
before sundown. What then?

27:21.666 --> 27:23.834
Dane said something
about an entrance.

27:23.836 --> 27:25.970
What if we get in,
get weapons?

27:25.972 --> 27:28.305
- A radio, medical supplies.
- It's worth a try.

27:28.307 --> 27:31.008
Look, if we build you a
stretcher, can we move you?

27:31.010 --> 27:33.546
Just splint my leg.
I can move on my own!

27:34.780 --> 27:36.747
Sam, are you nuts?

27:36.749 --> 27:38.849
- She's gonna slow us down.
- What did you say?

27:38.851 --> 27:41.418
So you just wanna leave her?
Here?

27:41.420 --> 27:44.121
You saw what happened.
Gomez in that tree, the tracks.

27:44.123 --> 27:46.390
Whatever that thing is,
it can come on land.

27:46.392 --> 27:48.092
We gotta get out of here now.

27:48.094 --> 27:51.128
Nobody is getting left behind!
Help me build a splint.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.796
She's not even one of us.

27:52.798 --> 27:54.566
You're a coldhearted
son of a bitch.

27:54.568 --> 27:56.568
- You know I'm right!
- Hey, hey!

27:56.570 --> 27:58.235
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey.

27:58.237 --> 28:00.405
Whatever that thing was...

28:00.407 --> 28:02.973
if it needs a body to feed on,
I vote for yours.

28:02.975 --> 28:05.644
Hey, let's not get crazy.
Just...

28:05.646 --> 28:08.613
Four years in the Marines.
A tour of Afghanistan.

28:08.615 --> 28:10.950
You wanna see how crazy
I can get?!

28:12.251 --> 28:15.453
Travis is dead
because of you.

28:15.455 --> 28:17.188
You couldn't
mind your own business,

28:17.190 --> 28:19.359
had to go
where you didn't belong.

28:21.628 --> 28:23.562
Hey, look.

28:23.564 --> 28:26.797
We are all in this together,
all right?

28:26.799 --> 28:29.033
You gotta put the gun down.

28:29.035 --> 28:30.569
I just wanna help you.

28:30.571 --> 28:32.671
I'm sorry.

28:32.673 --> 28:34.339
I'm sorry about Travis.

28:34.341 --> 28:37.475
I am sorry about all of this.

28:37.477 --> 28:40.312
But none of us
are getting out of here...

28:40.314 --> 28:42.915
if we kill each other first.

28:44.551 --> 28:46.186
You gotta trust me.

28:51.458 --> 28:54.725
- Okay. Okay. There it is.
- Okay.

29:17.851 --> 29:19.918
You sure there's
a way out of this?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.554
Sam and I have been in
rough spots before, okay?

29:22.556 --> 29:26.057
- We're gonna figure it out.
- "Exciting adventures," you said.

29:26.059 --> 29:27.559
"It'll make a great story.

29:27.561 --> 29:29.394
Raise your profile
with your editor."

29:29.396 --> 29:31.463
The only place my name's
getting published

29:31.465 --> 29:32.598
is in the obituaries.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.532
Alice, you're not gonna die.

29:34.534 --> 29:36.368
I'm not gonna let that
happen to you.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.069
Don't try
and "big sister" me.

29:38.071 --> 29:40.340
I know a dead end
when I see one.

29:43.243 --> 29:45.210
Hey. Hell, no. No.

29:45.212 --> 29:47.747
- I'm not going in there.
- Okay.

29:47.749 --> 29:49.617
You stay here. Good luck.

29:52.019 --> 29:53.586
Shit.

29:53.588 --> 29:55.956
This is some bullshit.

30:43.604 --> 30:45.640
What is this place?

30:49.877 --> 30:52.912
I heard it was a mine
a hundred years ago.

30:52.914 --> 30:55.047
But it got shut down
and everyone in town

30:55.049 --> 30:57.950
thought that was
the end of that.

30:57.952 --> 31:00.920
But my daddy talked
about these mysterious boats...

31:00.922 --> 31:03.824
coming and going
from the islands at night.

31:03.826 --> 31:06.160
Strange corporate types
passing through town.

31:07.796 --> 31:10.029
They sure were
up to something.

31:10.031 --> 31:12.465
But then it all
got shut down.

31:12.467 --> 31:14.768
Off-limits.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.469
Yeah, now we know why.

31:16.471 --> 31:19.372
Some kind of man-eating
creature wandering around.

31:19.374 --> 31:20.973
It doesn't make sense.

31:20.975 --> 31:23.846
If they knew that,
why wouldn't they kill it first?

31:39.394 --> 31:40.893
Hey, hey.

31:40.895 --> 31:42.562
Hey, come on, man.

31:42.564 --> 31:45.699
We don't wanna go further in.

31:45.701 --> 31:47.601
Do you wanna go back there?

31:47.603 --> 31:49.235
End up like Gomez?

31:49.237 --> 31:51.571
We need to find
a more secure space, man.

31:51.573 --> 31:53.274
This is bullshit!

32:11.860 --> 32:14.061
Hey, there's a
light down there.

32:26.442 --> 32:28.742
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

32:28.744 --> 32:30.277
Bring the rope.

32:30.279 --> 32:33.246
We're not going
down there, are we?

32:33.248 --> 32:34.650
Uh-uh.

32:46.395 --> 32:47.963
All right.

32:49.097 --> 32:50.766
That was easy.

33:00.042 --> 33:02.110
Whoo. Okay.

33:04.213 --> 33:06.714
Higher. Go on in.

33:06.716 --> 33:09.017
Easy. Easy. All right.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.921
I got you.

33:17.092 --> 33:18.595
You got this. You got this.

33:44.019 --> 33:45.486
Okay.

33:45.488 --> 33:47.153
It's all clear.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.122
Who's next?

33:49.124 --> 33:51.826
Okay, Alice.

33:51.828 --> 33:53.059
It's your turn.

33:53.061 --> 33:55.229
Come on.

33:55.231 --> 33:57.899
I can't do this.
You know I'm scared of heights.

33:57.901 --> 33:59.300
Yes, you can. You can.

33:59.302 --> 34:01.969
You did the roller coaster
at Coney Island.

34:01.971 --> 34:04.005
I threw up in Mom's purse.

34:04.007 --> 34:06.274
Yeah, but, uh...

34:06.276 --> 34:08.609
But you did it, okay? Twice.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.878
- So...
- Easy for you to say.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.547
You've always been
the brave one.

34:12.549 --> 34:16.417
Alice, I'm claustrophobic
as shit, okay?

34:16.418 --> 34:19.887
- You used to have to sing to me.
- No singing, please.

34:19.889 --> 34:22.322
Can we leave
the sister bullshit till later?

34:22.324 --> 34:25.626
Okay, fine. I'll go first.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.097
Then you're right behind me.
You promise?

34:29.532 --> 34:32.534
I got you. I got you. Oh...

34:37.106 --> 34:39.043
I got you.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.764
Okay, Alice!

35:02.766 --> 35:04.265
You got this!

35:04.267 --> 35:06.269
Just take it slow.

35:07.403 --> 35:09.270
Okay. Hey.

35:09.272 --> 35:12.173
You either climb down the rope
or I'm throwing you down.

35:12.175 --> 35:14.342
Hey, take it easy, Spencer.

35:14.344 --> 35:15.711
It's okay, Alice.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.111
You got this.

35:17.113 --> 35:20.181
You take it slow
and don't look down, okay?

35:20.183 --> 35:21.552
You can do it.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.463
All right, come on, come on.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.598
- Slowly.
- You good, Spencer?

35:36.600 --> 35:37.868
All right.

35:39.503 --> 35:41.837
Doing great!

35:41.839 --> 35:45.442
Okay. There you go!
Don't look down, Alice!

35:55.486 --> 35:57.152
Alice!

35:57.154 --> 35:59.187
- Spencer, help us!
- Come on!

35:59.189 --> 36:00.756
- Come on!
- Shit!

36:00.758 --> 36:02.024
- Wait!
- Come on!

36:02.026 --> 36:04.026
I can't go anymore!

36:04.028 --> 36:05.794
Come on!

36:05.796 --> 36:08.097
Oh... oh, shit.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.169
What happened?

36:13.470 --> 36:15.972
- What happened?
- Alice?

36:39.396 --> 36:40.730
Come on, come on.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.999
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, shit!

36:43.001 --> 36:45.737
Spencer! Billy!

36:48.338 --> 36:51.208
- It's okay.
- Shit. It's a dead end.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.411
- Shh. Listen.
- Spencer!

36:56.413 --> 36:57.914
Billy!

36:57.916 --> 36:59.682
Hey, Sam!

36:59.684 --> 37:02.384
Sam, it's Billy!
Can you hear me?

37:02.386 --> 37:05.088
- Are you okay?
- Hey! Hey!

37:05.090 --> 37:07.557
We're okay!

37:07.559 --> 37:09.458
Did you guys see that thing?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.494
It was like 50 feet long!

37:11.496 --> 37:13.496
We gotta get off this island,
man.

37:13.498 --> 37:16.165
Hey! We gotta stay calm.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.068
Don't tell me to stay calm!
You saw the size of that thing.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.235
Will you two shut up?

37:20.237 --> 37:21.539
Billy?

37:22.674 --> 37:25.141
Hey, Sam! Sam, we're here!

37:25.143 --> 37:27.643
Find a way to boost
your cell phone signal.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.747
There was a radio antenna
at the dock.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.250
If I can somehow connect
to that, then maybe.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.384
I don't know!

37:35.386 --> 37:37.522
Okay, you three head there!

37:39.290 --> 37:40.890
We're gonna continue.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.526
See if we can find supplies
or another way out.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.962
I'm not going.
That's gonna get us killed.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.564
We need to get back to the dock.
Okay.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.032
You stick together!

37:50.034 --> 37:52.769
Any sign of that thing,
you make a run for it.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.638
Yeah, that worked
out real well for Gomez!

37:55.640 --> 37:57.509
We're not dead yet.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.211
Come on, come on. Let's go.

38:01.213 --> 38:03.746
- Come on, I got you.
- God. Oh!

38:06.284 --> 38:08.120
Come on, Spencer.

38:09.155 --> 38:11.021
What are we doing?

38:17.796 --> 38:18.931
Now what?

38:21.200 --> 38:23.733
Now we find out
what secret this place has.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.304
You wanna go deeper inside?

38:30.608 --> 38:33.478
Okay. Okay. Follow Sam.
Follow Sam.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.751
Come on. We're close.

38:59.839 --> 39:02.842
Maybe that thing was a
big croc or an alligator.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.977
No, i-it's not.

39:06.979 --> 39:08.514
How do you know?

39:09.548 --> 39:12.316
Senior year of high school.

39:12.318 --> 39:14.585
GatorWorld.

39:14.587 --> 39:16.787
Tour guide said
the biggest crocs

39:16.789 --> 39:18.956
and gators
top out at 20 feet.

39:18.958 --> 39:21.758
But that thing
was way bigger than that.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.761
The teeth,
the size of the head...

39:24.763 --> 39:26.232
Okay.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.000
So, what is it, then?

39:30.002 --> 39:31.871
How the hell would I know?

39:33.606 --> 39:34.974
Hey.

39:36.176 --> 39:37.310
This way.

39:55.996 --> 39:57.694
What the hell are you doing?

39:57.696 --> 39:59.563
Open the cans.
Dump out the contents.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.431
You're gonna mad scientist?
Make what?

40:01.433 --> 40:03.734
With luck,
a 90-megahertz signal booster.

40:03.736 --> 40:06.070
- What?
- Secret of the wireless industry.

40:06.072 --> 40:08.438
They know the reception sucks
in most places.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.174
All cell phones have
a little port

40:10.176 --> 40:12.911
in the bottom, right here,
for an external antenna.

40:12.913 --> 40:14.544
We build a funnel to condense

40:14.546 --> 40:16.546
the faint signal
into a stronger one.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.150
- Hello, outside world.
- From tin cans and duct tape?

40:19.152 --> 40:20.919
You wanna swim
across the lake?

40:20.921 --> 40:22.387
- Go for it.
- No, thanks.

40:22.389 --> 40:24.456
- I'll stick with you, Poindexter.
- Shut up!

40:47.914 --> 40:49.282
Oh!

40:50.717 --> 40:53.286
Just hurry up.
Get this thing done.

41:38.565 --> 41:40.832
- Anything useful?
- No.

41:40.834 --> 41:43.268
Whoever was here must have left
in a big hurry.

41:43.270 --> 41:45.605
Yeah, so they
wouldn't get killed.

41:50.945 --> 41:53.278
Pharmetta Corp.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.614
They're one of the biggest,
most notorious conglomerates.

41:56.616 --> 42:00.052
They make everything,
from baby food to rocket fuel.

42:00.054 --> 42:01.719
And sued hundreds of times.

42:01.721 --> 42:04.189
Environmental disasters,
ethical violations.

42:04.191 --> 42:06.158
They scoped out
the abandoned mine

42:06.160 --> 42:08.394
and built underneath to keep
whatever the hell

42:08.396 --> 42:09.727
they were doing here
a secret.

42:09.729 --> 42:11.463
That makes sense.

42:11.465 --> 42:14.333
Yet they stay in business,
earning more and more money.

42:14.335 --> 42:17.204
Sure is profit
when you're raping the planet.

42:18.939 --> 42:21.308
But what were they
doing here?

42:35.956 --> 42:38.023
Hey, there could be
something down here.

42:38.025 --> 42:40.659
I don't know.

42:40.661 --> 42:42.895
Listen.

42:42.897 --> 42:45.297
We can't lose hope, okay?

42:45.299 --> 42:47.168
It's all we got now.

43:00.382 --> 43:03.916
Don't go down the stairs.
Horror Movie 101.

43:03.918 --> 43:05.820
Damn it.

43:15.729 --> 43:18.565
How is it possible
this place still has power?

43:18.567 --> 43:21.367
It's probably tied
into some geothermal source.

43:21.369 --> 43:23.503
The same thing making
the lake water warm.

43:23.505 --> 43:25.771
Yeah, but 20 years later?

43:25.773 --> 43:27.773
Maybe we aren't alone.

43:27.775 --> 43:30.644
What the hell were
they doing in here?

43:37.352 --> 43:39.852
Hard drives are gone,
but the equipment is here.

43:39.854 --> 43:42.090
Like Jade said,
they got out fast.

43:47.229 --> 43:48.597
Maybe not everything.

43:57.439 --> 43:59.738
Like the cattle
pens back in Missouri.

43:59.740 --> 44:03.009
Except flooded.
Not flooded accidentally.

44:03.011 --> 44:05.845
Looks like they were
designed that way.

44:05.847 --> 44:07.313
Jade.

44:07.315 --> 44:10.583
Maybe that's
what Pharmetta Corp was doing.

44:10.585 --> 44:14.020
Breeding these giant amphibians
like that thing out there.

44:14.022 --> 44:15.455
Okay, but why?

44:15.457 --> 44:17.357
They spliced arctic fish DNA
with corn

44:17.359 --> 44:18.691
to make it frost-resistant.

44:18.693 --> 44:20.994
They had an facility
where they were

44:20.996 --> 44:25.098
growing human organs
inside of pigs.

44:25.100 --> 44:28.168
It's not like ethics or morality
were ever in their playbook.

44:28.170 --> 44:32.138
But why make huge crocodiles?
And how?

44:32.140 --> 44:35.810
Why did Frankenstein make
a monster out of dead people?

44:37.245 --> 44:38.512
To play God.

44:38.514 --> 44:40.780
Okay, but if they
made that thing,

44:40.782 --> 44:42.815
why leave it alive?

44:42.817 --> 44:45.251
When they walked out,
why not destroy everything?

44:45.253 --> 44:48.489
We may never know why, Sam.
But that thing is out there.

44:48.491 --> 44:50.658
And if we can't find a way
off this island,

44:50.660 --> 44:53.396
it's gonna hunt
and kill all of us.

45:09.144 --> 45:10.477
Spencer, are you coming?

45:10.479 --> 45:12.879
What? No,
I'm not going out there.

45:12.881 --> 45:14.682
I've got a few rounds.
You sure?

45:14.684 --> 45:16.317
Our best chance
at a stray signal

45:16.319 --> 45:18.385
is at the end of the dock,
by the mast.

45:18.387 --> 45:20.753
All I need is enough signal
to get a 911 call.

45:20.755 --> 45:23.890
Okay. All right.
Hey, hey, hey.

45:23.892 --> 45:26.460
Look, I never really
liked you, Billy...

45:26.462 --> 45:29.496
but you hacked the school's
computer system that time.

45:29.498 --> 45:32.533
Changed my grades so I got
my baseball scholarship.

45:32.535 --> 45:33.866
- Yeah.
- You know,

45:33.868 --> 45:36.170
- well, that's when I knew.
- What?

45:36.172 --> 45:38.339
God made geeks for a reason.

45:38.341 --> 45:40.641
- Would you shut up?
- Sorry.

45:40.643 --> 45:42.809
Hey, I was kidding.

45:42.811 --> 45:44.545
- Shut up.
- Shit.

45:44.547 --> 45:46.249
I was kidding.

46:04.967 --> 46:06.302
Okay.

46:08.204 --> 46:09.740
I'm scared.

46:12.275 --> 46:14.645
- Would you hurry up?
- Okay.

46:21.284 --> 46:22.852
Oh, my God.

46:32.094 --> 46:33.528
I got it.

46:33.530 --> 46:35.029
Shh. Shh, shh.

46:35.031 --> 46:36.633
Thought I heard something.

46:37.701 --> 46:39.867
What?

46:39.869 --> 46:41.937
Hey. Can some...?

46:46.376 --> 46:48.410
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

46:48.412 --> 46:49.413
Spencer!

46:51.648 --> 46:52.980
Oh, my God.

46:52.982 --> 46:54.382
Spencer!

46:54.384 --> 46:56.284
Oh, my... Where is he?

46:56.286 --> 46:57.587
Oh, my God.

46:58.622 --> 47:00.255
Get away from the edge.

47:00.257 --> 47:02.791
- Let's go. Come on!
- Did you get through?

47:02.793 --> 47:05.694
No, I lost the signal!

47:07.698 --> 47:09.065
This way. This way.

47:20.143 --> 47:22.845
- Which way?
- I... I don't know.

47:29.619 --> 47:31.555
Okay. Oh, my God.

47:33.090 --> 47:34.522
Okay.

47:34.524 --> 47:35.459
Hey.

47:36.993 --> 47:39.329
Look.
Looks like a comm tower.

47:40.597 --> 47:43.166
- Looks like a shortwave...
- Oh, God.

47:44.434 --> 47:46.703
God, it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

47:48.505 --> 47:50.171
You should go on without me.

47:50.173 --> 47:51.707
- No way.
- Listen.

47:51.709 --> 47:55.009
Go to that comm tower,
get help for you and the others.

47:55.011 --> 47:57.212
- Pennie, I'm not leaving you.
- God. Oh, God.

47:57.214 --> 47:58.213
Which way?

47:59.684 --> 48:02.953
There's movement down there.
Oh, my God.

48:04.822 --> 48:06.488
- What the hell?
- Okay.

48:06.490 --> 48:08.657
It's hunting us.

48:08.659 --> 48:10.024
Like game.

48:10.026 --> 48:12.394
Oh, my God.
We gotta get out of here.

48:12.396 --> 48:14.097
We gotta go.
Come on.

48:20.003 --> 48:22.571
A facility of this
size must have a radio room.

48:22.573 --> 48:25.039
Some means of contacting
the outside world.

48:25.041 --> 48:27.275
We'll have to go further in
to find it.

48:27.277 --> 48:30.111
Like Theseus and the maze
of the Minotaur.

48:30.113 --> 48:32.681
She majored in journalism,
but she minored in:

48:32.683 --> 48:34.050
Greek mythology.

48:36.387 --> 48:39.822
The Minotaur was
a creature trapped in a lair

48:39.824 --> 48:42.892
that killed everyone
foolish enough to enter.

48:42.894 --> 48:44.727
We don't know
that croc can get in.

48:44.729 --> 48:46.328
We don't know that it can't.

48:46.330 --> 48:48.433
It probably started in one
of these things.

48:50.234 --> 48:53.538
Oh, yeah, they sure as hell
had crocs in here. Look.

48:59.277 --> 49:01.312
They were feeding them
livestock.

49:08.386 --> 49:09.821
Look at the size
of this thing.

49:12.123 --> 49:15.458
Crocodiles and alligators
can regrow lost teeth

49:15.460 --> 49:17.726
but not like that one.

49:17.728 --> 49:19.831
Okay, we gotta keep moving.

49:32.845 --> 49:33.812
God.

49:42.955 --> 49:44.487
What do we do?

49:44.489 --> 49:49.592
Like I said, you gotta leave me
and reach that tower.

49:49.594 --> 49:51.594
No. I can't.

49:51.596 --> 49:53.097
Look, it's got my scent.

49:56.735 --> 49:59.401
The blood.

49:59.403 --> 50:03.138
So you got only one chance
to live.

50:03.140 --> 50:04.841
Run.

50:04.843 --> 50:07.042
Or I'll shoot you myself.

50:07.044 --> 50:09.247
Run!

51:21.553 --> 51:24.588
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch!

51:24.590 --> 51:26.291
Come on!

51:27.693 --> 51:29.127
Come on!

51:31.064 --> 51:33.665
Come and get me, I'm here!

51:34.734 --> 51:37.003
Come on!

51:38.570 --> 51:42.374
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch! Come on!

51:49.716 --> 51:52.248
Come on!

51:52.250 --> 51:54.085
Come on!

51:54.087 --> 51:55.753
Come on!

51:55.755 --> 51:58.457
Come on. Come on.

52:45.405 --> 52:47.772
- Pennie.
- Not too far from here.

52:47.774 --> 52:50.274
It's inside!
What are we gonna do?

52:50.276 --> 52:52.943
Let's go. Let's go.

53:05.591 --> 53:07.959
We need to figure out
how to kill that thing

53:07.961 --> 53:09.328
before it kills us.

53:20.007 --> 53:21.541
What is it?

54:08.689 --> 54:09.790
Dane?

54:10.991 --> 54:12.559
Oh, man.

54:13.527 --> 54:15.362
Am I glad to see you.

54:41.555 --> 54:44.056
You shouldn't have
taken the bait, Sam.

54:44.058 --> 54:45.657
Oh, really?

54:45.659 --> 54:48.261
You set us up just so you could
beat us one more time?

54:48.263 --> 54:50.129
You always
had the advantage.

54:50.131 --> 54:53.132
Yeah, you really thought
he was gonna ignore your video?

54:53.134 --> 54:55.433
Look, all I wanted was
to hook Sam back in.

54:55.435 --> 54:57.302
Keep him
in the game.

54:57.304 --> 54:59.439
At least I thought
this was a game.

55:01.775 --> 55:04.376
People are dead
because of you.

55:04.378 --> 55:05.744
You think
I don't know that?

55:05.746 --> 55:09.714
Gomez, Bonita, Jones.

55:09.716 --> 55:11.784
You think I don't know?

55:11.786 --> 55:14.954
Look, I barely even made it
in here alive.

55:14.956 --> 55:17.256
Henderson left me
out there to die.

55:17.258 --> 55:20.161
Who the hell
is Henderson?

55:22.496 --> 55:24.632
He's the reason
I found out about this place.

55:25.934 --> 55:27.467
But why?

55:28.703 --> 55:31.369
He used me
to get in and out.

55:31.371 --> 55:34.307
Did he know that thing
was loose here?

55:34.309 --> 55:36.609
Did you?

55:36.611 --> 55:39.212
You son of a bitch.

55:39.214 --> 55:40.980
You brought us here,
and you knew?

55:40.982 --> 55:42.014
I didn't.

55:42.016 --> 55:43.918
- Did you?
- I didn't!

55:46.054 --> 55:47.320
I didn't.

55:47.322 --> 55:48.988
Neither did he.

55:48.990 --> 55:50.623
At least,
that's what he told me.

55:50.625 --> 55:52.258
I've been trying
to get the truth

55:52.260 --> 55:53.826
out of him
since I came here.

55:53.828 --> 55:54.896
What does that mean?

55:57.765 --> 56:00.266
We were just
a cover story for him.

56:00.268 --> 56:02.134
This?

56:02.136 --> 56:03.371
This was
all a big lie.

56:25.261 --> 56:26.961
Sh...

56:37.405 --> 56:39.108
This way.

56:46.848 --> 56:48.215
Come on.

56:48.217 --> 56:49.919
We'll be safe here.

56:57.159 --> 56:58.524
A radio.

56:58.526 --> 57:00.526
Bingo.

57:00.528 --> 57:01.862
Hey.

57:01.864 --> 57:04.064
Maybe we can reroute
this emergency lighting,

57:04.066 --> 57:05.933
try and get that thing
working again.

57:05.935 --> 57:07.367
That was the idea.

57:07.369 --> 57:10.404
Took a while to get
the generator working.

57:10.406 --> 57:13.774
Fortunately, it's diesel,
or else we'd be out of luck.

57:13.776 --> 57:15.541
At least I got
these lights to work.

57:15.543 --> 57:16.910
Yeah,
what about this radio?

57:16.912 --> 57:18.679
It's dead.

57:18.681 --> 57:20.681
The radio
will never work.

57:20.683 --> 57:24.987
You won't be calling for help
any time soon.

57:27.122 --> 57:30.123
Jesus, Dane. What the hell
is going on here, man?

57:30.125 --> 57:32.726
That's Henderson.
He lied to me.

57:32.728 --> 57:35.562
He promised he was gonna
document everything.

57:35.564 --> 57:37.798
This was gonna be
our greatest achievement,

57:37.800 --> 57:39.566
planting
our flag here.

57:39.568 --> 57:41.768
But that wasn't the truth,
was it, Henderson?

57:41.770 --> 57:43.670
Nah.

57:43.672 --> 57:45.505
None of it was.

57:45.507 --> 57:47.607
So much for
my Twitter followers.

57:47.609 --> 57:50.310
He knew exactly
what he was getting into.

57:50.312 --> 57:52.313
See this?
Does this even look like

57:52.315 --> 57:54.449
a standard issue
for a reporter?

57:54.451 --> 57:57.285
Someone who was gonna make
our triumph go viral?

57:57.287 --> 57:58.319
A tranq gun.

57:58.321 --> 57:59.886
Just for safety.

57:59.888 --> 58:02.956
A big-ass needle.
I mean, what's it for?

58:02.958 --> 58:04.558
And these vacu-tubes?

58:04.560 --> 58:06.760
Is this gun strong enough
to kill our friend?

58:06.762 --> 58:07.928
Nope.

58:07.930 --> 58:09.896
But in the right spot,

58:09.898 --> 58:13.500
it would knock her out for
a hell of a nap.

58:13.502 --> 58:16.137
Wait, so you used us
as a cover to,

58:16.139 --> 58:18.072
what,
harvest DNA samples?

58:18.074 --> 58:21.109
No, no.
No, I brought him.

58:21.111 --> 58:24.011
Y-y-you were his idea.

58:24.013 --> 58:26.546
Tell them. Go on.

58:26.548 --> 58:29.649
- What?
- Tell them!

58:29.651 --> 58:32.487
The bastard used to work
for Pharmetta Corp.

58:32.489 --> 58:35.490
Yes, yes. That's
true, and I'm proud of it.

58:35.492 --> 58:37.557
I'm proud of the work
we did here.

58:37.559 --> 58:41.062
We were on the cutting edge
of DNA stem-cell research.

58:41.064 --> 58:43.297
No, don't split hairs!

58:43.299 --> 58:45.066
Tell them
about the damn project!

58:45.068 --> 58:48.036
Listen,
if I untie you,

58:48.038 --> 58:49.669
are you gonna
tell us everything?

58:49.671 --> 58:51.372
Yes, yes. Of course.

58:51.374 --> 58:52.539
What, trust him?

58:52.541 --> 58:53.573
Y-yeah...

58:53.575 --> 58:55.245
You're not gonna
trust him.

58:58.181 --> 59:01.282
I am gonna
let you out of here.

59:01.284 --> 59:03.017
And you're gonna
tell us everything.

59:03.019 --> 59:03.987
Yes.

59:09.626 --> 59:11.225
From the beginning.

59:11.227 --> 59:13.795
Then you're gonna lead us
out of here, understand?

59:13.797 --> 59:14.996
- Yes.
- No, no.

59:14.998 --> 59:16.531
He lied to us

59:16.533 --> 59:18.766
to get us to sneak
him in here and get him out.

59:18.768 --> 59:21.469
I'm sure as hell he lied
about the 100 grand, as well.

59:21.471 --> 59:23.037
Yeah, well,
it is not up to you,

59:23.039 --> 59:24.705
because there
was never any race.

59:24.707 --> 59:26.874
You always had the advantage
from the start,

59:26.876 --> 59:28.544
and you knew
you'd get here first.

59:28.546 --> 59:30.344
So you?
You can't be trusted either.

59:30.346 --> 59:32.346
Don't get all sanctimonious
on me, Sammy.

59:32.348 --> 59:34.984
This was
a stupid game.

59:37.087 --> 59:38.955
Don't trust him.

59:43.193 --> 59:45.259
Thank you.

59:54.771 --> 59:56.538
You wanna
blow us all up?

59:56.540 --> 59:59.341
These tunnels
are probably full of gas.

59:59.343 --> 01:00:02.279
I'm afraid
we'll all be dead soon enough.

01:00:04.948 --> 01:00:06.484
Huh.

01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:09.184
Retirement gift?

01:00:09.186 --> 01:00:11.686
Now tell us everything.
Now.

01:00:11.688 --> 01:00:14.189
We broke the genetic code

01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:18.693
in discovering the key
to splicing inherited DNA.

01:00:18.695 --> 01:00:20.761
You were breeding giant,
custom-built,

01:00:20.763 --> 01:00:22.797
man-eating
crocodiles.

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:26.101
Yes.
You make it sound trivial.

01:00:26.103 --> 01:00:28.537
This is batshit crazy,
is what it is.

01:00:28.539 --> 01:00:31.173
It was important work.
You don't understand.

01:00:31.175 --> 01:00:34.476
Why don't you try
explaining it to us, then?

01:00:34.478 --> 01:00:35.844
We needed to study them

01:00:35.846 --> 01:00:38.514
to derive a vaccine
using their DNA.

01:00:38.516 --> 01:00:41.083
I ain't no reptile expert,

01:00:41.085 --> 01:00:43.519
but that animal
is not like anything

01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:46.255
that I have ever seen
before in my life.

01:00:46.257 --> 01:00:47.489
Yes.

01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:49.758
Well,
sh-she's a hybrid.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.028
Part modern-day creature,
part <i>Purussaurus brasiliensis...</i>

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:54.796
In English.

01:00:54.798 --> 01:00:56.298
Extinct.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.500
From the Miocene era.

01:00:58.502 --> 01:01:00.135
Eight million years ago.

01:01:00.137 --> 01:01:01.503
So let me get
this straight.

01:01:01.505 --> 01:01:03.338
Pharmetta Corp
was crossing the DNA

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:07.409
of some prehistoric creature
with a modern-day crocodile?

01:01:07.411 --> 01:01:08.410
Yes.

01:01:08.412 --> 01:01:09.678
You made a monster.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.246
No, no.

01:01:11.248 --> 01:01:14.683
We were trying to save lives,
help humanity.

01:01:14.685 --> 01:01:17.152
Well, that didn't work out
so well, did it?

01:01:17.154 --> 01:01:19.821
My question is: Why?

01:01:19.823 --> 01:01:21.924
- Why now?
- I'd always been suspicious

01:01:21.926 --> 01:01:26.161
that there were a line of crocs
here, still alive somehow.

01:01:26.163 --> 01:01:27.863
Oh, yeah?
And why was that?

01:01:27.865 --> 01:01:29.698
A Pharmetta Corp
veterinarian

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.867
in charge of caring
for the animals.

01:01:31.869 --> 01:01:34.136
When we got
the order to shut down,

01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:37.340
he left with
a live specimen,

01:01:37.342 --> 01:01:40.809
went back home
to Lake Placid, Maine.

01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:44.880
But his stolen pet grew up,
grew hungry,

01:01:44.882 --> 01:01:49.385
and I'm fairly certain,
made a nice meal out of him.

01:01:49.387 --> 01:01:52.422
Before he left,
when the order came down

01:01:52.424 --> 01:01:54.357
to euthanize
all of the animals

01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:56.526
our good vet
devised a plan

01:01:56.528 --> 01:02:00.163
to give the rest of the crocs
a chance to survive.

01:02:00.165 --> 01:02:02.831
And that croc out there
is the sole survivor.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:05.368
Nobody from the company
came to check?

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.869
They rendered
the complex quarantined

01:02:07.871 --> 01:02:10.673
and washed their hands
of the whole thing.

01:02:10.675 --> 01:02:13.376
But I needed viable DNA,

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:15.678
and that-that's
where you came in.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.813
With the techniques
we have today,

01:02:17.815 --> 01:02:20.250
from stem cells
from that-that croc,

01:02:20.252 --> 01:02:22.885
I could...
I could change medicine.

01:02:22.887 --> 01:02:24.520
You could
make billions.

01:02:24.522 --> 01:02:26.556
Save millions,
making billions, yes.

01:02:26.558 --> 01:02:28.024
That's a good business.

01:02:28.026 --> 01:02:29.892
Revolutionary.

01:02:29.894 --> 01:02:35.064
Stem-cell research, a whole new
series of antibiotics, it...

01:02:35.066 --> 01:02:36.668
It would be enormous!

01:02:37.469 --> 01:02:38.736
Listen to me.

01:02:38.738 --> 01:02:40.303
You are gonna
show us a way out.

01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:42.438
Yes, yes, yes, uh...

01:02:44.075 --> 01:02:48.578
Um. Emergency inflatables
at the s-service bay.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.414
They may still work.
If not, it's still a way out.

01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:53.483
I-I could
take you there.

01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:55.084
Yeah.

01:02:55.086 --> 01:02:58.121
Yeah,
you're gonna take us there.

01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:05.295
- Hello?
- <i>Jade?</i>

01:03:05.297 --> 01:03:07.731
<i>Oh, my God.
Are you guys okay?</i>

01:03:07.733 --> 01:03:09.932
<i>Billy. Billy, how did you...?</i>

01:03:09.934 --> 01:03:11.801
I managed to get
the intercom working.

01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:13.737
No connection
to the outside world yet.

01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:15.307
<i>I'm working on that.</i>

01:03:16.374 --> 01:03:17.541
Billy, we heard...

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:19.208
We heard gunshots.
Screaming.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.577
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:23.313
It was Pennie. She...

01:03:23.315 --> 01:03:26.983
She-she sacrificed herself
for me.

01:03:26.985 --> 01:03:28.585
<i>Spencer?</i>

01:03:32.425 --> 01:03:34.025
He's gone, Jade.

01:03:38.163 --> 01:03:39.998
It got him too.

01:03:42.368 --> 01:03:45.536
Billy, we gotta get help, okay?
We gotta get out of here.

01:03:45.538 --> 01:03:47.304
<i>I know.</i>

01:03:47.306 --> 01:03:51.442
I used the radio antenna
as a giant boost for my cell.

01:03:51.444 --> 01:03:52.975
The signal's still weak,

01:03:52.977 --> 01:03:55.212
but I got a call out
to 911 before it cut out.

01:03:55.214 --> 01:03:56.547
If I can do it again,

01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:58.649
maybe they can
geolocate the source.

01:03:58.651 --> 01:03:59.650
Then...

01:04:04.623 --> 01:04:05.989
Jade.

01:04:05.991 --> 01:04:08.492
I th... I th...

01:04:08.494 --> 01:04:10.294
Billy?

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:14.698
Billy?
Billy, we lost you.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.100
Are you still there?

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.803
It's here, Jade.

01:04:19.372 --> 01:04:21.939
It's hunting him.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.374
Billy,
listen to me.

01:04:23.376 --> 01:04:26.379
<i>You've gotta stay still.</i>

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:33.951
Just stay put
until you're really sure.

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.830
No!

01:04:45.832 --> 01:04:47.498
Billy?

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.867
Billy,
what's happening?

01:04:48.869 --> 01:04:50.436
Shut off
that noise now!

01:05:02.516 --> 01:05:04.083
Billy! Billy!

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.731
We're never
getting out of h...

01:05:19.733 --> 01:05:23.435
Alice, Alice,
okay, look at me.

01:05:23.437 --> 01:05:25.703
I need you, okay?

01:05:25.705 --> 01:05:28.642
I am so sorry
for everything.

01:05:30.377 --> 01:05:32.410
I wanna go home.

01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:35.148
I want this nightmare
to be over.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.384
Where's Henderson?

01:05:39.386 --> 01:05:40.718
I told you!

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.254
I goddamn told you!

01:05:43.256 --> 01:05:44.691
Come on!

01:06:02.944 --> 01:06:04.976
He knows this
place inside and out.

01:06:04.978 --> 01:06:06.511
He's probably
long gone now.

01:06:06.513 --> 01:06:08.346
He must've gotten
here by a boat.

01:06:08.348 --> 01:06:09.781
Think he's headed
back there?

01:06:09.783 --> 01:06:11.149
No.

01:06:11.151 --> 01:06:12.918
Do you think
he went that way?

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.586
No, it sunk.

01:06:14.588 --> 01:06:16.221
That thing
broke it apart.

01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:18.389
Yeah, same as ours.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.527
So where
do you think he went?

01:06:41.348 --> 01:06:42.984
It's him.

01:06:44.986 --> 01:06:46.952
He's probably heading
to the service bay

01:06:46.954 --> 01:06:48.687
he told us about.

01:06:48.689 --> 01:06:51.122
I hope you're right.

01:07:24.392 --> 01:07:26.292
Oh, shit.

01:07:26.294 --> 01:07:28.627
Are you saying this
wasn't flooded already?

01:07:28.629 --> 01:07:30.063
Henderson.

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:33.999
Now what do we do?

01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:36.037
We gotta
get to the other end.

01:08:09.103 --> 01:08:10.436
We gotta swim for it.

01:08:10.438 --> 01:08:12.471
Before
the whole thing's flooded.

01:08:12.473 --> 01:08:14.874
How do we know that creature
isn't down there?

01:08:14.876 --> 01:08:17.612
We don't.
But it's the only way.

01:08:19.246 --> 01:08:22.615
You and Alice stay here
while I check it out.

01:08:22.617 --> 01:08:25.386
Hey,
don't be a cowboy.

01:08:58.252 --> 01:09:00.420
You know, this never
would have happened

01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:02.022
if we'd still been
one crew.

01:09:02.024 --> 01:09:04.323
Hey. You're the one
who walked away, remember?

01:09:04.326 --> 01:09:06.826
You set this whole thing
in motion.

01:09:06.828 --> 01:09:09.828
You proposed.

01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:11.965
Shit.

01:09:11.966 --> 01:09:15.167
What happened to
the old Sam?

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.670
I grew up.

01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:18.040
You should
try it sometime.

01:09:22.778 --> 01:09:23.943
There.

01:09:23.944 --> 01:09:25.479
That's it.

01:09:27.182 --> 01:09:29.783
That's a long swim.

01:09:29.785 --> 01:09:31.618
I know.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.621
Sam? You good?

01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:36.090
He's fine.

01:09:36.091 --> 01:09:38.825
Hey, come on down!

01:09:38.827 --> 01:09:42.194
If it's a choice between
being eaten and getting wet,

01:09:42.197 --> 01:09:43.832
I'll take
door number two.

01:09:54.077 --> 01:09:56.913
Jade, it's okay!
Come on!

01:10:04.519 --> 01:10:05.955
Jade, move! Now!

01:10:17.432 --> 01:10:19.499
What the hell
is that?

01:10:19.501 --> 01:10:21.771
Time to go.
Come on.

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.944
Alice,
go quickly. Go!

01:10:29.178 --> 01:10:31.047
I can't do it, Sam.

01:10:38.221 --> 01:10:40.654
- Jade, you have to go.
- No.

01:10:40.656 --> 01:10:42.556
Sam, I can't!
I can't!

01:10:42.558 --> 01:10:45.762
Hold your breath,
and you're gonna have to swim.

01:10:49.065 --> 01:10:51.332
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:54.637 --> 01:10:56.971
Jade, go!
You gotta swim!

01:10:56.973 --> 01:10:58.372
You can! You can!

01:10:58.374 --> 01:11:00.608
Hey, look,
you're gonna have to swim.

01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:02.109
No, no.

01:11:02.111 --> 01:11:04.879
Just look at me.
You're gonna count to three.

01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:07.114
- Okay.
- You can do this. Okay?

01:11:07.116 --> 01:11:08.649
- Okay.
- You can do this.

01:11:08.651 --> 01:11:12.553
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

01:11:12.555 --> 01:11:14.357
Hold your breath.

01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:33.507
I saw something, Sam.

01:11:33.509 --> 01:11:34.610
Right there.

01:11:38.414 --> 01:11:40.414
You're almost there.
You're almost there.

01:11:40.416 --> 01:11:43.452
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going.

01:12:03.707 --> 01:12:06.141
Something's coming!

01:12:06.143 --> 01:12:07.878
It's in the water.

01:12:12.216 --> 01:12:13.584
Come on!

01:12:27.965 --> 01:12:29.931
Come on!

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:39.977
Sam! Sam!

01:12:41.612 --> 01:12:43.678
- Sam!
- Did you get it?

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.447
Sam!

01:12:45.449 --> 01:12:47.849
I can't... I can't see.
I can't see.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.528
Alice, run!

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:07.602
Come on!

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.222
We're going in circles.

01:13:26.224 --> 01:13:27.889
We're never gonna
get out of here.

01:13:27.891 --> 01:13:30.128
Dane,
just shut up, man.

01:13:41.105 --> 01:13:42.737
Shit, it's locked.

01:13:42.739 --> 01:13:44.641
Now we gotta go back!

01:13:55.386 --> 01:13:57.288
Jade, help me.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:01.556
Wanna lift?
One, two...

01:14:08.266 --> 01:14:11.600
Okay. Alice,
you go down first.

01:14:11.602 --> 01:14:14.136
Okay? I'm right behind
you. Come on.

01:14:14.138 --> 01:14:15.840
Down you go.

01:14:17.809 --> 01:14:20.211
There you go.
Okay.

01:14:30.088 --> 01:14:32.023
Dane. Dane.

01:14:33.624 --> 01:14:34.792
Come on, man.

01:14:48.474 --> 01:14:49.939
Dane! Dane!

01:14:49.941 --> 01:14:50.875
No!

01:15:26.412 --> 01:15:28.512
This isn't a service bay.
It's a dead end.

01:15:28.514 --> 01:15:29.678
Henderson lied.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.914
Big surprise.

01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:45.697
It knows our every move.

01:15:53.138 --> 01:15:55.539
There is only one way
we're getting out of here,

01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:58.577
and that's if
we kill that thing.

01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:18.728
There's flares!

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:21.066
Let's go. Let's go!

01:18:01.367 --> 01:18:05.169
Sam. What are you doing?

01:18:05.171 --> 01:18:06.837
There's still gas
in these tanks.

01:18:06.839 --> 01:18:08.407
We vent the gas
in the room,

01:18:08.409 --> 01:18:10.808
we lure that thing in here
and use those flares.

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:12.210
Instant napalm.

01:18:12.212 --> 01:18:14.045
Just one problem:
we burn up with it.

01:18:14.047 --> 01:18:15.947
One of us is gonna
have to lure it in,

01:18:15.949 --> 01:18:17.782
and get out
before the gas ignites.

01:18:17.784 --> 01:18:18.783
It's a stupid plan.

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:20.352
Alice, it's our only plan!

01:18:20.354 --> 01:18:22.186
We are gonna
blow that thing to hell.

01:18:22.188 --> 01:18:24.021
For Dane,
for Spencer,

01:18:24.023 --> 01:18:26.759
for Billy,
for everyone else!

01:18:28.295 --> 01:18:31.062
Except you're not
gonna be the bait.

01:18:31.064 --> 01:18:33.030
I am.

01:18:33.032 --> 01:18:34.666
Sam. Sam!

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:38.071
No! No. No. No.

01:18:40.073 --> 01:18:43.542
Listen, if we all stay here,
we all die.

01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:45.377
And somebody needs
to tell the world

01:18:45.379 --> 01:18:47.248
about what Pharmetta Corp
has done here.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:54.421
Go! Go!

01:19:04.732 --> 01:19:07.532
Sam, wait, no.
I need you, please.

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:08.768
I love you.

01:19:09.769 --> 01:19:12.571
No! No!

01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:14.539
Jade, come on!

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.041
Jade!

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:37.664
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:40.899
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

01:21:32.046 --> 01:21:34.380
Come here,
you asshole.

01:21:34.382 --> 01:21:36.951
That's it.

01:21:43.793 --> 01:21:46.225
I'll see you in hell.

01:21:51.734 --> 01:21:52.900
Oh, shit.

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:02.543
- Sam!
- Where's the explosion?

01:22:02.545 --> 01:22:03.943
It didn't work.

01:22:03.945 --> 01:22:05.579
That thing
is still alive.

01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:07.648
Run!

01:22:15.957 --> 01:22:18.057
It's Pennie! Oh, shit.

01:22:18.059 --> 01:22:21.628
Okay, Alice. Alice!
Alice, don't look.

01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.266
Don't lose it on me now,
just don't look. Okay?

01:22:26.034 --> 01:22:27.568
Alice?

01:22:30.972 --> 01:22:32.908
Run. Run!

01:22:53.964 --> 01:22:55.498
Damn.

01:23:54.491 --> 01:23:58.393
Alice! You gotta get up!
You gotta get up!

01:23:58.395 --> 01:24:00.728
Lean on me.
You're okay.

01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:17.412
Okay. Okay.

01:24:17.414 --> 01:24:20.214
Okay, easy.
You're good?

01:24:20.216 --> 01:24:22.016
Okay, wait here,
all right?

01:24:22.018 --> 01:24:23.351
What?
Are you serious?

01:24:23.353 --> 01:24:24.652
I promise,
I will be back.

01:24:24.654 --> 01:24:26.055
Jade!

01:24:26.057 --> 01:24:28.423
Wait, please
don't leave me here alone.

01:24:28.425 --> 01:24:29.891
That thing is coming.

01:24:29.893 --> 01:24:31.192
I need you to trust me.

01:24:31.194 --> 01:24:33.028
Have we ever
let each other down?

01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:35.998
Okay,
I am not gonna start now.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.833
Okay? Okay.

01:24:38.835 --> 01:24:40.368
Where are you going?

01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:41.669
Stay there!

01:25:37.928 --> 01:25:40.831
Jade! Jade, help!

01:25:41.932 --> 01:25:43.868
Jade!

01:25:45.168 --> 01:25:47.872
No! Help!

01:26:10.162 --> 01:26:11.595
Jade!

01:26:14.398 --> 01:26:15.366
Jade.

01:26:23.874 --> 01:26:26.343
Jade!

01:26:29.313 --> 01:26:30.548
Alice!

01:26:36.888 --> 01:26:38.589
Yes!

01:27:43.321 --> 01:27:45.524
This is for Sam.

01:28:26.933 --> 01:28:28.698
World's biggest barbecue.

01:28:33.105 --> 01:28:36.809
What now?
How are we gonna get home?

01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:42.647
Well, I guess there's
only one way out of here.

01:29:27.942 --> 01:29:30.861
