WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.085
There's no escaping it.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.338
The problem...

00:06.965 --> 00:08.090
is me.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.675
And now...

00:11.094 --> 00:12.345
I have to leave you.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.680
- Forever.
- Michael...

00:14.765 --> 00:17.433
You can't be the problem.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.851
Oh, but I am.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.521
You see, architects aren't supposed to live

00:21.772 --> 00:23.689
in the Neighbourhoods they design.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.568
But I love humans so I wanted to try.

00:27.778 --> 00:32.156
I took something great and I ruined it
a little so I could enjoy it more.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.450
I "frozen-yoghurted" the Neighbourhood.

00:35.035 --> 00:39.247
My meddling is the one true constant
in all of our disasters.

00:39.540 --> 00:45.753
I tried to force Jianyu into opening up,
which caused a sinkhole to open up.

00:46.505 --> 00:50.967
I kicked a puppy into the sun,
and garbage rained down.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.804
I grossly underestimated
the number of shrimp needed

00:54.888 --> 00:55.888
for the opening night party

00:56.348 --> 01:01.102
and what flew through the sky the next day,
taunting me for my failures?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.729
I'm sorry, everyone, I'm truly sorry.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.565
Janet?

01:05.649 --> 01:08.943
Please call a train to escort me
into retirement.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.029
You see, the only way in
and out of a Neighbourhood

01:12.114 --> 01:16.200
is by train and Janet is the only one
who can operate them.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.496
Oh, my dear Janet.
Will you be okay after I leave?

01:20.831 --> 01:24.250
Yes. This will not affect me in any way.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.168
Geez, show some compassion!

01:26.587 --> 01:31.924
Well, I can't feel "sad" but here's my best
approximation of human crying.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.970
Bah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

01:36.054 --> 01:38.222
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

01:42.185 --> 01:45.396
Oh, Janet. That was beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.823
What did you say to him?
Did you make him do this, somehow?

01:55.991 --> 01:58.492
Nope! This was entirely his idea.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.453
Dude, this is good news.

02:00.621 --> 02:04.206
Michael's gonna get a chill retirement
which, frankly, he desperately needs

02:04.333 --> 02:06.125
and I can finally relax.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.961
It's forking perfect!
- No, it's terrible.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.464
Michael's wrong, he's not the problem.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.424
Well, Michael did bring me here

02:13.508 --> 02:16.093
which was the mistake
that led to all the other problems

02:16.678 --> 02:20.056
so in that sense he is the real problem.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.391
Ha! How do you like them ethics?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.894
I just "ethics-ed" you in the face, Chidi!

02:24.978 --> 02:27.229
It doesn't change the fact
that we weren't truthful.

02:27.522 --> 02:32.693
There's an old Chinese proverb
"Lies are like tigers, they are bad."

02:33.278 --> 02:35.237
That's it?
- It's more poetic in Mandarin.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.990
Look. Michael is retiring.

02:38.116 --> 02:42.078
He's gonna be on an angel boat somewhere
smoking moonbeam cigars.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.581
Now, Tahani is throwing him
a goodbye party. Let's go help out.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.251
Sure, that will more than make up
for the pain and misery and lying.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.836
Yes! Now you're getting it!

02:53.465 --> 02:57.885
Hey, Chidi! Just read your article
on logical positivism, so dry.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.136
Oh, thanks, Henry.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.263
Whoa. New boots?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.390
Oh! Yeah!

03:02.766 --> 03:05.935
Just got 'em. Saw them in the store
and I was just like, "Whoa!"

03:06.228 --> 03:08.396
And tell the truth. Do you like them?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.064
Oh.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.401
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? You think so?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.735
They're... they are really cool.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.070
Not too red?
- No.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.321
Crystals are not too much.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.490
Crystals are not too much.
- They point just right, right?

03:19.574 --> 03:21.033
Just... just enough.
- Just fine. Ha!

03:21.326 --> 03:24.120
Well, that makes me feel so much better.
'cause I was really going back and forth

03:24.204 --> 03:25.538
over whether they were worth the money.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.622
They were super expensive.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.458
Yeah. Well, they're, uh... amazing.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.711
I mean those are the coolest boots
I've ever seen in my life.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.672
Thanks so much, buddy.
- Bye.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.261
My god. What have I done.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.306
Tonight needs to be the perfect blend

03:44.391 --> 03:46.684
of celebratory, reverential

03:46.768 --> 03:50.062
bittersweet, upbeat, fun, and effortless.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.899
This is hashtag "Tahani Time"!

03:54.776 --> 03:55.818
What is all this?

03:55.902 --> 03:59.572
Oh, no! Michael, you're not supposed
to see it until it's all set up.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.407
But, well...

04:01.742 --> 04:03.909
Welcome to your retirement party!

04:04.161 --> 04:07.204
Look over there. I've even set up a buffet
of themed desserts, like

04:07.456 --> 04:10.583
retire-mint chocolate cake...
or a "Flan Voyage!"

04:10.667 --> 04:12.001
Oh, boy.
- Oh...

04:12.085 --> 04:15.254
And here we have a piñata shaped like you,
which is always fun.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.299
By the way, what's your favourite colour,
for the tablecloths?

04:18.508 --> 04:23.012
Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes.
It's called "Pleurigloss."

04:23.346 --> 04:24.680
Could you describe it?

04:24.848 --> 04:26.724
It's the colour of...

04:27.100 --> 04:31.479
when a soldier comes home from war
and sees his dog for the first time.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.731
Hmm. How about blue?

04:33.815 --> 04:36.817
Tahani, I'm so sorry.
We need to cancel this party, immediately.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.319
But why?

04:38.528 --> 04:44.074
For a being like me, "retirement"
is not something "fun."

04:44.159 --> 04:46.786
What is "retirement," for you, exactly?

04:46.870 --> 04:49.330
Well, I wasn't going to share this,
so as not to upset you

04:49.414 --> 04:52.958
but it's an extreme form of punishment.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.669
We call it "The Eternal Shriek."

04:56.087 --> 04:57.671
My soul will be disintegrated

04:58.006 --> 05:01.801
and each molecule be placed on the surface
of a different burning sun.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.552
And then my...

05:03.720 --> 05:07.598
my "essence" will be scooped out of my body
with a flaming ladle,

05:07.682 --> 05:09.350
and poured over hot diamonds.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.352
Oh, but, the diamonds sound lovely.
- They're not.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.521
And then what's left of my body

05:13.647 --> 05:16.565
will be endlessly beaten
with a titanium rod, like a...

05:17.317 --> 05:18.734
Like a piñata.
- Yes.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.904
Except you have the string
around my waist

05:21.988 --> 05:24.824
but instead it will definitely
be around my genitals.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.534
What?
- Oh, Michael...

05:26.576 --> 05:29.912
I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to honour you.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
Please allow me to reconceive the event.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.082
Of course.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.544
All right, everyone!
We're starting over!

05:36.878 --> 05:39.046
The keyword for tonight is just "sombre."

05:39.297 --> 05:41.340
Jianyu, my love, we're gonna have to
get rid of all the party poppers

05:41.424 --> 05:42.508
immediately.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.093
No. No. Not by using them!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.804
No, Jianyu. Stop it. Darling.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.016
He's gonna be tortured? Dang it.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.061
I was almost handed a perfect solution
to all my problems

05:54.145 --> 05:56.981
without having to work for it at all,
and now it's gone.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.108
Why do bad things always happen

05:59.276 --> 06:01.902
to mediocre people
who are lying about their identities?

06:01.987 --> 06:05.739
Okay, you have two options.
You can confess, and save Michael.

06:05.824 --> 06:10.286
Or you can continue to lie and condemn him
to an eternity of unimaginable pain.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.497
Or option "C", continue to lie about myself

06:13.915 --> 06:15.499
and find a way to save Michael.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.502
Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.672
That would be a classic two birds
with one stone scenario.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.258
Plus I'll get her house. Three birds.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.261
No. There's no way to stop this
except confessing.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.056
Any moment now Michael is going to get on
that train and we will never see him again.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.892
Just like Professor Lindeman

06:33.143 --> 06:36.186
after I asked him to re-read
my thirty-six hundred-page manuscript.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.397
He said he was going out for cigarettes

06:38.481 --> 06:40.941
but then he just left his tenured position
at the Sorbonne.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.402
Great story. Janet?

06:43.486 --> 06:44.528
Hi there!

06:44.613 --> 06:47.781
Hi. So, the only way out
of the Neighbourhood is a train?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.618
That's correct.
I am the only one who can call the train

06:50.744 --> 06:52.119
and it needs me to operate.

06:52.704 --> 06:53.746
Choo-choo!

06:54.205 --> 06:56.457
One more question and, um...
this is a little weird, but...

06:56.875 --> 07:00.169
can we, uh... shut you down?

07:00.337 --> 07:01.378
Yes. Great question.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.256
There is a kill switch in a remote sector
of the Neighbourhood

07:04.341 --> 07:07.509
in the event that I malfunction
and attempt to harm the residents.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.012
If you press it, I will be destroyed.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.182
Anything else?
- No, that's good. Thanks.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.644
Okay.
- Whoa. Wait. You want to kill Janet?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.812
Michael can't retire if he can't leave.

07:18.897 --> 07:22.024
He can't leave if there's no Janet
to run the train.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.276
It's a perfect solution.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.613
Janet, high-five please?

07:27.697 --> 07:28.739
Thanks, babe.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.369
You cannot kill Janet!

07:33.662 --> 07:36.163
"Killing" is one of the most famous...

07:36.247 --> 07:38.916
moral no-nos.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.877
Janet is a non-human object
who was sent here to help us.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.421
And the way she can help us
is if we kill her.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.092
We're doing one, small, "murder-y"
thing for a bigger, better reason.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.594
The ends justify the means.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.639
Do you know who said that?
- Was it someone nice and great

07:53.723 --> 07:54.765
like Oprah?

07:55.100 --> 07:58.686
It was Machiavelli,
a very non-Oprah-like figure.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.438
And what happens after we kill her?
We'll have to lie

08:01.481 --> 08:04.149
to everyone, about what we did.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.486
And lying is always wrong.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.660
Why? Why would I tell Henry
that I liked his boots?

08:14.744 --> 08:16.620
I don't like his boots. I hate his boots.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.456
Yes, I know, you've talked about it
for the last two days.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.749
I lied to him.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.584
You wrote your thesis on Kant.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.296
He believed that lying is always
morally wrong, no exceptions.

08:26.589 --> 08:31.510
Yes, well, Kant was a lonely obsessive hermit
with zero friends.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.429
Sometimes we do things just to be polite.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.597
If you really feel that strongly about it

08:35.682 --> 08:36.724
Tell him the truth.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.394
Also, I don't care,
because it's the middle of the night.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.358
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

08:47.819 --> 08:48.861
They do?

08:49.904 --> 08:53.699
Hey, Chidi. Sit in on my class today?
- Uh, I... I did, yeah.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.494
Great lecture, by the way, so bleak.
- Thanks, bud!

08:57.579 --> 09:00.998
Oh, it's actually perfect that you are here.
I got something for you.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.960
Oh, my God!
- You loved mine so much

09:05.045 --> 09:06.545
I decided to get you your own pair.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.380
We can be boot brothers!

09:08.465 --> 09:10.674
Wow. I... I can't accept these.
They're too expensive.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.468
Sure you can.
Try 'em on, mate.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.053
The fact that you liked mine so much

09:14.137 --> 09:16.597
really made me fee like I made
the right choice to buy them.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.642
After all, why should I have all the fun
and boots, aye?

09:20.769 --> 09:21.852
I... I... I don't know.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.980
Those look great.

09:25.982 --> 09:26.857
Take 'em for a spin.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.152
You're flying.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.820
Thanks!

09:33.239 --> 09:36.200
Speeches! Time for speeches, everyone!

09:36.284 --> 09:37.326
Michael?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.411
Hmm?
- As someone who didn't exactly have

09:39.621 --> 09:41.080
the steadiest parental guidance

09:41.581 --> 09:44.750
I just want to thank you.
You were always there for us.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.753
I shouldn't have been, that was the problem.

09:47.879 --> 09:52.382
Yes, but, it was also great
when you weren't there.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.135
Don't worry, soon I won't be, forever.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.553
Because of the Eternal Shriek!

09:56.721 --> 09:58.138
Yes, thank you Glenn.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.682
Look, what I'm trying to say is this -

10:00.975 --> 10:03.852
Michael, you always kept us warm and safe

10:04.479 --> 10:06.647
like a bright glowing sun.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.233
Like the one I kicked the dog into

10:09.692 --> 10:13.362
or the one I'm going to be burned
on the surface of for eternity?

10:13.446 --> 10:16.865
Okay, no more speeches!
Speeches are over!

10:16.950 --> 10:18.367
Michael's going to talk now.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.704
Oh, I'm sorry I was so grumpy. It's just...

10:23.957 --> 10:28.168
I'm sad that I have to leave before
doing all the human things

10:28.253 --> 10:29.419
that I wanted to do.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.840
I wanted to get my hair wet.
You know, I...

10:33.174 --> 10:37.845
I wanted to pull a hamstring,
to learn the difference between

10:37.929 --> 10:39.930
"toward" and "towards".

10:40.557 --> 10:42.850
I wanted to do that thing
where you walk down the hallway

10:42.934 --> 10:47.521
and someone else is walking the other way,
and then you both lean to one side

10:48.481 --> 10:52.109
and then the other, and then you both
chuckle over your shared foible.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.695
I wanted to get a rewards card

10:54.737 --> 10:56.155
any rewards card.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.701
I... I wanted to talk briefly to someone,
and then say

11:01.119 --> 11:02.327
"Take it sleazy."

11:04.289 --> 11:05.998
I wanted to eat a saltine.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.960
Oh, I actually have some saltines!
Here, try this.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.801
Pretty dry...

11:18.928 --> 11:19.970
and too salty.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.515
Well, going out on a real low note, here.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.184
Okay, bye, everyone.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.060
Well, take it sleazy!

11:27.854 --> 11:29.062
You got to say it?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.190
Yes, but then you say it back.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.901
No, it's not organic.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.491
Janet, how many "Janets" have there been?

11:41.576 --> 11:44.161
There have been twenty-five generations
of Janet.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.415
Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom
and social abilities.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.752
Fun fact, the first Janet had a click wheel.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.213
So, it's like aging, for a human.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.672
You're... you're growing up.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.466
That's how I like to think of it, Chidi.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.053
I can't eat,
so every time there's a new version of Janet

12:01.179 --> 12:02.846
I like to take a piece of birthday cake

12:03.139 --> 12:05.182
and smash it around where my mouth is.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.480
Janet has... has learned and grown,
she's essentially living a life.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.358
We can't kill her.
- Not with that attitude we can't.

12:14.734 --> 12:19.154
Listen man, I'm dead, you're dead,
we all died, and now we're killing her.

12:19.864 --> 12:20.906
Pay it forward!

12:21.032 --> 12:23.283
Uh, no... that's not what that means,
at all. Eleanor!

12:24.786 --> 12:25.827
Here we are!

12:26.496 --> 12:29.331
Just press that button,
and it's "Goodbye, Janet!"

12:31.417 --> 12:34.586
Chidi, I can see that you're worried
and I just want to assure you

12:34.671 --> 12:37.631
I am not human, and I cannot feel pain.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.216
Thank you. That helps.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.178
However, I should warn you
I am programmed with a fail-safe measure.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.974
As you approach the kill switch,
I will begin to beg for my life.

12:47.392 --> 12:51.812
It's just there in case of an accidental
shut down, but it will seem very real.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.481
Cool. So who's doing this, me or you?

12:54.565 --> 12:55.691
Oh, uh, I...

12:55.775 --> 12:59.027
I think I have to.
Being a bystander seems worse, somehow.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.322
Okay, here we go.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.534
Chidi, no, no, no.
Chidi, please, please

13:05.618 --> 13:07.286
please don't hurt me.
I don't want to die!

13:07.370 --> 13:08.537
Please, please...

13:09.539 --> 13:12.708
Again, I am not human.
I can't die.

13:13.209 --> 13:18.380
I am simply an anthropomorphised vessel
of knowledge built to make your life easier.

13:18.965 --> 13:23.677
Your pleading seems so real!
- Oh, yes, it is a very effective fail-safe.

13:23.928 --> 13:27.347
Ugh. You want a robot killed right
you have to do it yourself.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.267
Eleanor, Eleanor, no, no, no,
please, wait, wait, wait

13:30.351 --> 13:31.435
Eleanor, I have kids.

13:31.602 --> 13:37.065
I have three beautiful children
Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny, baby Phillip.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.818
Look at Tyler, Tyler has asthma,
but he is battling it like a champ!

13:40.028 --> 13:42.029
Look at him. No, Eleanor, look at them.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.780
Look at them!

13:43.865 --> 13:45.073
Look at them!

13:45.533 --> 13:48.160
Ah! It's so realistic!
- Eleanor, again, I am not human.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.412
This is a stock photo of the crowd

13:50.496 --> 13:52.706
at the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.957
That's right.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.626
It's not real. Let's just do this.
- Right.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.086
Please, I have so much to live for!
No, no, no!

13:58.171 --> 14:00.422
What? We're... we're not even near the...
- Hey guys, what's going on?

14:00.757 --> 14:04.301
That party was lame, so I bailed.
Then I saw you, so I followed you here.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.970
Oh, look, a button!
- No, don't no!

14:07.055 --> 14:08.096
No, don't.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.691
Aw, man!
I wanted to push that button!

14:20.068 --> 14:21.485
Not cool, dude.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.112
Whoa, what happened to Janet?

14:24.155 --> 14:26.948
She's... she's dead. I... I... I killed her.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.202
Not killed. Remember,
Janet was not a living being

14:30.286 --> 14:31.703
so she can't be killed.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.373
<i>Attention. I have been murdered.</i>

14:34.791 --> 14:37.042
<i>Attention, I have been murdered.</i>

14:37.377 --> 14:39.753
<i>Attention, I have been murdered.</i>

14:40.421 --> 14:42.881
<i>Attention, I have been murdered.</i>

14:43.800 --> 14:45.384
What do we do, Eleanor?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.720
What do we do?
Chidi, you just murdered Janet!

14:49.430 --> 14:52.057
We have to flee your crime scene. Run!

14:52.433 --> 14:56.103
Sorry, Janet.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.276
<i>Attention, I have been murdered.</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:06.822
Okay, dude, crash course in getting away
with bad stuff.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.367
You have to act calm and cool,
like you don't have a care in the world.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.952
Mm-hmm.
- Okay? Great.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.081
Oh, wow, look, its "Weekend at Bernie's"

15:16.457 --> 15:18.250
Use you're a dead guy in sunglasses.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.544
We have fun, don't we, Chidi?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.879
I have never been more stressed
out in my entire life.

15:22.964 --> 15:26.299
I know what you need.
- Janet, can you get Chidi some weed?

15:27.385 --> 15:30.345
Oh, that's right, you killed Janet!

15:30.805 --> 15:34.057
Search-party!
Follow me to the site of the alarm.

15:34.350 --> 15:39.271
We will not rest until we avenge
the brutal murder of our trusted sister!

15:39.355 --> 15:41.273
Yeah!

15:41.691 --> 15:43.525
Yay.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.705
Poor Janet.
We must give her a proper send-off.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.833
I would be honoured to help plan
Janet's funeral.

16:00.001 --> 16:04.546
Oh, Tahani, are you sure?
I don't mean to add insult to injury

16:04.630 --> 16:08.925
but my retirement party
was a tiny bit gauche.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.136
Oh, no! Not the "G" word.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.347
Oh, Michael, please,
please give me another chance.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.559
It'll be the classiest event
I have ever planned.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.144
Janet's funeral is going to make

16:19.228 --> 16:22.522
the Guggenheim Foundation Pancreatic
Cancer Summer Classic 2009

16:23.149 --> 16:26.610
look like the Guggenheim Foundation
Pancreatic Cancer Summer Classic 2004!

16:27.570 --> 16:28.612
All right.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.367
Just breathe in.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.119
Breathe out.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.829
Think of your favourite things.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.832
Ethics. Reading.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.628
Drinking milk, after I take
my lactose intolerance medication.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.880
Quiet movies. Fitted bedsheets.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.382
Cool seeds. A new bookmark.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.302
Unsalted almonds...
- Those are your favourite things?

16:52.595 --> 16:56.181
This is too much for me.
I can't maintain this fiction.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.225
This is just too much for me, Eleanor.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.521
Well, Janet's been murdered.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.607
That's a nice capper to this wonderful day.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.527
I don't really know what happens now,
because...

17:08.903 --> 17:10.529
Janet has never been murdered before

17:11.239 --> 17:16.284
only today, here, on my watch,
while I was distracted with a party that...

17:16.452 --> 17:18.912
Tahani was throwing for me,
which I didn't want.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.914
Michael, you mustn't blame yourself.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.541
I'm not. I'm blaming you.

17:22.917 --> 17:26.586
Anyway, what is there to say about
Janet that hasn't already been said

17:26.671 --> 17:31.841
by the giant Janet alarm in the sky?
"I've been murdered."

17:33.010 --> 17:35.387
- I think that says it all.
- Hello!

17:38.057 --> 17:40.350
Janet! You're alive!

17:40.726 --> 17:41.810
Hello! Architect,

17:42.353 --> 17:44.854
Please enter your four-digit pin.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.816
Uh, what is it...
um, what is it...

17:48.276 --> 17:50.694
Oh right, right, right.
It's my, uh, my birth year.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.739
Oh boy, I gotta change that.
That's too easy to guess.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.910
Janet, who murdered you?

17:58.995 --> 18:00.287
- Oh, no.
- Shh...

18:00.788 --> 18:02.497
Hello!
- Yes, hello.

18:02.540 --> 18:07.377
Oh, yeah, uh,
her memory must have been wiped clean...

18:07.461 --> 18:08.962
So now she's gonna have to

18:09.130 --> 18:11.756
re-upload all the knowledge in the universe

18:12.049 --> 18:13.091
which will only take a few days.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.259
Okay.
- Hello.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.928
Hello.
- Hello! Hello.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.639
Everyone, um...
until I get to the bottom of this

18:20.433 --> 18:22.892
my retirement is officially postponed.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.185
Whoo!

18:24.270 --> 18:26.187
Hello!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.648
Hello! Hello!

18:29.859 --> 18:32.402
Ya gotta admit, I kinda nailed it.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.030
All we have to do now is keep
the secret forever.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.574
J dog, you cool?
- No.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.077
By the time I got to the piñata
all the candy was gone.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.412
He's not going to tell anyone.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.998
Chidi? Cheedster?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.042
What's, uh... happening, buddy?

18:47.126 --> 18:50.503
You have a crazy look in your eye
and you're retreating into your shirt.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.339
You're kind of like turtling.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.968
Henry, are you all right?
What happened?

18:57.094 --> 18:59.679
I have an aneurysm,
requires emergency surgery.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.473
Doctors give me a fifty-fifty chance

19:01.557 --> 19:05.268
so if there's anything you need
to say to me, you should do it now.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.939
Oh, well, actually, um...

19:11.984 --> 19:13.526
They let you wear your boots in here?

19:13.611 --> 19:15.111
They're the only things
that bring me comfort.

19:15.446 --> 19:16.529
That, and my wife.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.823
But she's out getting me
a pair of backup boots.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.827
She says it's my incentive
to make it through.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.247
What did you want to say to me?

19:26.999 --> 19:32.379
Oh, um, just that I'm here
and I love you, man.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.173
I love you, too, boot brother.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.717
Okay.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.762
Had 'em sharpened.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.138
Uh, yeah.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.727
Chidi! You didn't have to stay
here all night.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.938
So, surgery went well? All clear?

19:50.231 --> 19:51.481
Right as rain, buddy!

19:51.649 --> 19:56.486
That is so, so, so great. I hate your boots.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.947
What?
- I told you that I loved your boots

19:59.031 --> 20:02.951
three years ago, and I was lying,
and that lie has haunted me ever since.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.703
And people tried to tell me it was fine

20:04.787 --> 20:06.830
just a nice little white lie
in the form of social niceties

20:06.914 --> 20:09.249
but I disagreed, and then yesterday
I thought you were gonna die

20:09.333 --> 20:11.126
but now you're not dead and I can finally

20:11.210 --> 20:13.545
be honest and say that
those boots are terrible

20:13.754 --> 20:15.672
and hideous and I hate them.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.174
Whoo!

20:19.635 --> 20:22.971
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.348
Yeah. I know. And I get it.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.102
I don't care that she came back

20:29.145 --> 20:32.856
or that we did it for a good reason,
I can't live with this lie.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.899
I'm going to confess
to the murder of Janet.

20:37.653 --> 20:38.695
What?

20:40.322 --> 20:44.868
Dude, why? Janet is fine!
We didn't harm her at all.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.120
We didn't? Hey, Janet?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.246
Hello!

20:48.289 --> 20:49.956
- Hello?
- Hello!

20:50.040 --> 20:52.709
Janet, would you please recite
the English alphabet?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.712
A, B... Janet!

20:56.172 --> 20:57.464
She knows her A, B-Janets!

20:57.757 --> 21:01.760
She literally knew everything
in the universe, and now she's a baby!

21:01.886 --> 21:04.512
And even if she were OK,
it would be too painful for me

21:04.764 --> 21:06.055
to live with these lies.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.807
What are you talking about?

21:07.892 --> 21:10.477
It is so easy to live with a lie.

21:10.770 --> 21:15.231
I once pretended to have a terminal illness
to meet Scott Wolf at a Sunglass Hut.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.609
A victimless crime.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.447
Fine. I won't say anything,
because I promised to help you

21:22.782 --> 21:25.074
and the moral implications...

21:25.117 --> 21:26.367
of everything that we've done

21:26.452 --> 21:28.995
are so complicated that I may
never untangle them.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.289
But I hate lying. I always have.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.417
And this is going to
eat me up inside, forever.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.504
You might be able to shrug this off
and forget about it, but I never will.

21:40.925 --> 21:41.966
Hello.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.302
Hi.
- Hello.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.888
Hi.
- Hello.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.014
Jianyu.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.936
Michael? Janet said you wanted
to speak to me.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.606
But actually, she was just drooling
a lot and saying "hello"

21:56.982 --> 21:59.192
over and over again,
but she did point at you.

21:59.902 --> 22:00.985
I owe you an apology.

22:01.570 --> 22:05.532
Oh, no you don't.
No, um... but please continue.

22:06.325 --> 22:11.371
You were only trying to help.
And I let my sadness cloud my judgment.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.290
You're a wonderful person.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.753
And if I ever do have a retirement party,
I hope you plan it.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.136
Thank you for gathering, everyone.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.222
I want to keep you all updated.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.682
Here's what we know.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.976
Someone slaughtered Janet.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.603
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.273
- Okay. Easy.
- I assume that this horrifying act

22:38.315 --> 22:41.401
is somehow related to
the other issues we've had here.

22:42.152 --> 22:45.321
It also means that the problems
in this Neighbourhood

22:46.198 --> 22:48.366
are not one hundred percent my fault.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.911
There is something else at work here.

22:52.580 --> 22:56.499
If anyone has any information
about any of this

22:57.209 --> 22:59.627
I beg you. Tell me.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.424
Hey, I love you, man.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.971
Michael?
The problem in the Neighbourhood...

23:11.473 --> 23:12.515
is me.

23:14.393 --> 23:18.688
I was brought to the Good Place by mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
