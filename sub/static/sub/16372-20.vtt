00:20.120 --> 00:21.110
Hey, stop.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.675
- It's a clasp.
- Let's go back to the house.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.520
My parents won't be back
from the club until midnight.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.872
Fine, but let me tell Jennifer.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.440
She'd kill me if I ditch.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.756
I was thinking,
maybe later, we should go to...

00:47.920 --> 00:50.196
...Joey Schoenberger's cabin at...

00:51.600 --> 00:52.636
Who the hell are you?

00:53.600 --> 00:54.920
Stop.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.280
Ty?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.836
You bastard.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.675
Do you remember Eileen Kropp?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.354
What the...?

01:20.920 --> 01:22.320
Why can't I move my legs?

01:22.960 --> 01:25.794
- Get me out of here.
- Yeah, you know, she's dead now.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.560
Overdosed on the Long Beach pier...

01:28.720 --> 01:31.110
...on some cocktail of drugs
you sold her.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.754
Body still...

01:32.920 --> 01:34.400
...unable to move.

01:34.600 --> 01:39.800
And when the tide came in,
all Eileen could do was...

01:39.960 --> 01:43.510
...lie there and listen
to the waves lapping over her.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.433
Look, whatever this is...

01:45.600 --> 01:49.037
- ...I promise I can fix this.
- This is called recompense.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.072
Eileen Kropp's father, you see...

01:51.240 --> 01:54.517
...he tasked me
with doling out your penance.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.232
And so, like Eileen...

01:57.400 --> 01:59.631
...you will lie and listen...

02:00.320 --> 02:02.152
...and breathe until you're still.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.037
- Recompense.
- What?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.873
I can... I can give you money.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.439
Say it with me.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.997
- Recompense.
- Okay.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.514
Recompense.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.432
- That's a good boy.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please, God, no.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.714
No, no, no. Please.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.195
Please, no. God.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.915
Please, no. Please, God. No.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.199
Oh, no.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.558
Help.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.034
Baldur.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.520
What are you doing here?

03:02.680 --> 03:05.354
Admiring your tasteful decor.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.751
You don't spend much time here,
do you?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.350
- Get out.
- Not still upset...

03:12.560 --> 03:14.631
...about our little misunderstanding,
are you?

03:14.840 --> 03:16.399
You wanted to kill me.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.120
Prepared. I was prepared to kill you.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.751
Being prepared for something
doesn't necessarily speak to desire.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.274
And here we are.

03:24.440 --> 03:29.151
Congratulations. I'm told you're opening
offices in Paris and London.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.630
My accountant's untimely demise...

03:31.840 --> 03:34.036
...left the door wide open for you...

03:34.200 --> 03:36.760
...to purchase that fleet
of cruise ships for a song.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.237
- Well, now...
- I know what happened with Von Hauser.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.959
Everyone does.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.998
That's why you're here, isn't it?

03:44.200 --> 03:46.476
- For safe passage.
- Yes.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.554
Werner's death has cost me my
travel routes in and out of the Continent.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.474
And I'm sure whoever
has my jet at the moment...

03:53.640 --> 03:57.395
...is trying to decide whether to keep it,
or at what astronomical price...

03:57.560 --> 03:59.279
...they'll sell it back to me.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.552
In the meantime,
I have urgent business in the States...

04:02.760 --> 04:04.080
...and no way to get there.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.277
There was talk before Von Hauser.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.319
Rumors that you were under siege.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.200
People are sharpening their knives.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.993
Are they?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.750
Baldur, you and I are dealmakers.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.196
We buy low and sell high.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.556
Getting that cruise line on the cheap
was better than sex with your mistress.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.713
Either of them.
I'm a little down on my luck.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.351
A penny stock.
Invest in me now, and when I rise...

04:32.520 --> 04:35.718
...you'll be able to
afford three mistresses.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.476
I may have something in steerage.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.229
Done.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.312
My goodness.
I haven't been in steerage...

04:44.480 --> 04:48.030
...since Li Yanping and I stowed away
on a Chinese destroyer...

04:48.200 --> 04:51.830
...off the coast of Pulau Belitung.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.956
He's known as the Debt Collector.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.999
A mercenary paid to exact revenge.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.516
Exact revenge on me? For what?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.990
All I can tell you
is he's coming to Washington.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.550
<i>- But who hired him? Mr. Kaplan?
- No.</i>

05:05.720 --> 05:09.350
Kate may be targeting people
around you, but not you.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.239
Someone else put him up to this.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.551
Unfortunately,
I'm in no position to help.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.558
<i>- Where are you?
- Not there.</i>

05:15.720 --> 05:17.552
You need to take this to Cooper.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.552
<i>- Are you sure?
- I've spent 30 years...</i>

05:19.720 --> 05:24.272
...building an intelligence network
of spies, informants, patriots, traitors.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.717
I've used it to build an empire
that exists for only two reasons:

05:27.880 --> 05:30.395
To keep me free and you safe.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.393
<i>Elizabeth, I may not be there...</i>

05:32.600 --> 05:34.956
...but I have eyes and ears everywhere.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.113
And they tell me
the Debt Collector is coming for you...

05:38.280 --> 05:41.273
...which means
he's the next Blacklister.

05:42.120 --> 05:46.512
The Debt Collector is an avenging angel
who's hired to exact poetic revenge.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.637
His terms are simple.
Whatever the crime...

05:48.800 --> 05:50.792
...he exacts
an equal measure of punishment.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.078
A pound of flesh.
An extralegal way to even the score.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.357
I'll assign detail to your apartment.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.789
Did Reddington have a lead?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.879
Just a 15-year-old murder story
about a senator's daughter...

06:01.080 --> 06:03.800
...who bought cocaine
laced with ketamine.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.510
Ultimately, she passed out on the beach
and drowned when the tide came in.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.031
<i>Reddington says the senator hired
the Debt Collector to get revenge.</i>

06:11.200 --> 06:13.715
Against the kid who sold her the drugs.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.030
Tyler Obermeir.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.677
Story has it the senator wanted him
to die exactly like his daughter did.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.992
- You need to contact the senator.
- I tried. He died last year.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.675
<i>- What about the dealer?
- Tyler's body was never found.</i>

06:24.840 --> 06:28.754
You said the senator wanted the dealer
to die the way his daughter died?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.354
- Yeah, so?
- So...

06:30.520 --> 06:32.000
...exactly, where did she die?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.989
Long Beach. Under the pier.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.556
Alert local authorities.
Tell them to start digging.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.754
- Any news on Ressler?
- Getting out on O.R. Gonna pick him up.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.639
I shot a Secret Service agent.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.797
You'd been drugged. Manipulated.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.953
Well, there's a defense for you.
I mean, "I'm sorry, Your Honor.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.032
- But he was manipulated."
- You were.

06:51.200 --> 06:55.956
And Dr. Krilov's in custody, negotiating
immunity for info about his patients.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.396
The truth will come out,
and you won't be charged.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.877
In the meantime, you're off active duty,
which is what Kaplan intended.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.714
Picking off another Reddington loyalist.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.200
I'm loyal to the task force.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.632
I know, which is why this terrible
situation may have a silver lining.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.598
- Gale.
- You're free to work with him.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.434
He thinks Reddington's
feeding Keen intel on criminals.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.718
That in exchange,
she's keeping him a step ahead of us.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.076
And you need to keep it that way.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.991
- What do we got?
- One hell of an informant is what you got.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.595
Whoever tipped you two
had incredible specifics.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.157
Fifteen years later,
it's a miracle we found anything.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.389
The body hasn't decomposed.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.398
Desiccation must
have slowed the decay.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.671
Airtight, he mummified.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.878
Tyler M. Obermeir. 140 Edgewood
Avenue, Bridgehampton, New York.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.590
After all this time, think toxicology
could give us anything on the killer?

07:51.760 --> 07:54.355
I'm gonna be able to tell you
this guy's last two meals.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.715
But it's gonna take time.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.910
- How long?
- Two weeks.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.192
Ten days if we throw everything
we got at it.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.993
Elizabeth, tell me something good.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.995
We found Tyler Obermeir, but even if
toxicology can tell us something about...

08:12.160 --> 08:14.516
...this Debt Collector,
it's gonna take some time.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.792
- We don't have time.
- Medical examiner said two weeks.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.795
Elizabeth, you can flip through
every Rolodex at the Bureau...

08:21.960 --> 08:24.839
...but when it comes to matters
of death and necropsy...

08:25.000 --> 08:28.630
<i>...there is one technician who has gifts
that simply cannot be matched.</i>

08:29.320 --> 08:30.800
How did you get this number?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.673
Kate, I need your services.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.918
<i>- Said the spider to the fly.
- I wish I were that clever.</i>

08:36.159 --> 08:39.517
This is for Elizabeth.
I need you to look at a body.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.470
Okay, Mr. Cooper, are you ready?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.391
Okay. Here we go.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.676
<i>Raymond notified me that the Bureau
may require my assistance.</i>

08:58.840 --> 09:01.958
You're wanted for crimes
ranging from kidnapping to murder.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.680
We are not offering you a deal
for your assistance.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.390
<i>Understood. You're targeting me
because I'm targeting Raymond.</i>

09:08.560 --> 09:10.756
<i>- You targeted Ressler.
- Collateral damage.</i>

09:11.240 --> 09:15.632
<i>To get to Raymond, I may need
to get to his enablers, including you.</i>

09:16.600 --> 09:19.479
<i>- Hello. Good to see you.
- I know you have good intentions...</i>

09:19.640 --> 09:21.916
...but you've gotta stop.
I don't need your help.

09:22.120 --> 09:26.114
<i>If that were true, we wouldn't be having
this conversation, would we?</i>

09:26.280 --> 09:27.839
<i>The body, tell me about him.</i>

09:28.040 --> 09:30.839
He was murdered by the man
we believe is hunting Agent Keen.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.755
We're hoping the victim or trace evidence
on the victim may lead to his capture.

09:34.920 --> 09:38.357
<i>I'll examine the body under terms and
conditions that guarantee my freedom.</i>

09:38.520 --> 09:40.830
<i>I can't very well protect Elizabeth
from prison.</i>

09:41.000 --> 09:43.037
I don't need your protection.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.352
<i>You do know why you're being hunted
by the Debt Collector, don't you?</i>

09:46.560 --> 09:47.835
No, do you?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.832
<i>It's because you're in Raymond's life.</i>

09:50.000 --> 09:52.799
<i>As long as you are,
killers will be in yours.</i>

09:53.280 --> 09:55.033
What are your terms and conditions?

09:55.280 --> 09:57.351
<i>I need you to dead-drop the body.</i>

09:58.120 --> 09:59.679
Dead-drop a corpse?

09:59.840 --> 10:01.194
<i>Sounds fun, doesn't it?</i>

10:02.360 --> 10:03.635
<i>Here's what you're gonna do.</i>

10:03.840 --> 10:07.754
<i>The corpse will be transported to a
warehouse near the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</i>

10:07.960 --> 10:10.873
<i>Once on-site,
it will be inspected by my people.</i>

10:11.080 --> 10:13.549
<i>- You have people?
- Once they're confident we're good...</i>

10:13.720 --> 10:17.475
<i>...they'll transport the body
and are not to be followed.</i>

10:26.200 --> 10:28.237
Stay with them. Get me HRT.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.399
<i>If the transport goes as expected...</i>

10:35.560 --> 10:38.359
<i>...the body will be delivered
to me for examination.</i>

10:47.760 --> 10:49.672
They stopped under the expressway.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.116
Rodney and Meeker,
they're making some swap.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.316
Stay with that truck.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.793
<i>If I find something,
when I find something, I will report that.</i>

11:08.240 --> 11:11.074
Roll out HRT.
We breach on my command.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.679
It's a decoy.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.394
This coffin has a false bottom.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.030
The body never left the drop point.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.475
Thank you. You can leave us.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.440
New digs. Nice.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.640
You get tired of the ice rink?

12:08.200 --> 12:11.113
The crime scene's officially processed.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.591
But these bodies, they're talking to me.
Wanna know what they're saying?

12:14.760 --> 12:16.592
You tell me. You're the ghost whisperer.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.355
They're saying that
Reddington is untouchable.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.634
I mean... These were powerful people,
Donnie, yet...

12:22.840 --> 12:24.957
...they're all here. Why?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.196
Because they crossed Reddington.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.397
Because they informed on him.
Because they...

12:30.600 --> 12:33.638
They actually thought
that they could defy him.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.593
Now, the living...

12:35.760 --> 12:38.229
The living are telling
a whole different story.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.194
This is about Keen helping him.
That's not a story.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.073
I mean, that's a fairy tale.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.677
I know you don't want that
to be true about Keen or any other agent.

12:46.840 --> 12:47.876
Neither do I.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.750
Especially after everything that we did
trying to bring down Reddington.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.597
But I'm not talking about Keen.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.193
I'm talking Reddington's cleaner.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.711
She unearthed 86 of his victims, 86.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.231
You know what that tells me?
That she thinks he's touchable.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.278
And if she thinks he's touchable...

13:06.440 --> 13:08.477
...I'm willing to bet others do as well.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.791
Let's find out, Donnie. Come on.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.873
- Where we going?
- Hey, were you gone?

13:14.040 --> 13:16.874
- I feel like you were gone.
- Things got crazy on another case.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.475
Crazier than an ice-skating rink
full of dead bodies?

13:21.640 --> 13:23.836
I got brainwashed into thinking that...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.720
...the president's
national security advisor had...

13:26.880 --> 13:29.395
...kidnapped an eyewitness
to the murder she committed.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.472
Brainwashing, huh?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.110
Come on.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.873
- Where we going?
- Federal building.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.914
- An appointment with Marvin Gerard.
- Reddington's lawyer.

13:38.440 --> 13:42.593
- How'd you know that?
- How many years did we track him for?

13:45.880 --> 13:47.234
Line two.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.760
Were you able to find anything?

13:50.920 --> 13:53.992
I was. The man you're looking for
is Edgar Grant.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.277
Did you pull a print or find blood?

13:56.480 --> 13:57.914
<i>Grant was too careful for that.</i>

13:58.080 --> 14:01.960
He left no trace. He did everything
to make sure the body was never found.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.799
Which is how I found him.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.633
- Zeolite.
- Zeolite?

14:05.800 --> 14:08.713
Mr. Obermeir died of suffocation,
which tells us nothing.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.877
The tell is in how he was buried.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.680
Zeolite absorbed the odors
from the decaying body...

14:13.840 --> 14:15.513
...which is why he wasn't found.

14:15.720 --> 14:20.272
Zeolite is commonly used to control odors
in hospitals and schools.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.870
Get a list of schools
and facilities in the area.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.394
<i>- You don't need a list.
- Why?</i>

14:24.560 --> 14:27.200
Grant works at Horizon Middle School
in Fairfax County.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.477
I suppose you're gonna tell us
what he does.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.670
He's a janitor.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.998
I ran the Long Beach police logs
the night Obermeir vanished...

14:34.160 --> 14:37.358
...and it turns out a pickup truck
was cited for a broken taillight...

14:37.560 --> 14:39.597
...four blocks
from where Obermeir was found.

14:39.760 --> 14:43.720
Let me guess. The driver was a janitor
named Edgar Grant.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.395
Get a last known address.
Navabi, Keen, get there.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.280
Not Elizabeth.
The Debt Collector's looking for her.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.840
She's right. It's dangerous.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.912
- I wanna be in the field.
- I know.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.793
But you should be at the safehouse.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.676
<i>We'll notify you
when we have Grant in custody.</i>

14:59.160 --> 15:00.833
We have agents at the school now.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.555
He's not there,
and he didn't show up for work today.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.155
Have any idea where he might be
or how to reach him?

15:06.320 --> 15:09.472
Edgar's working late.
There's a dance at the school tonight.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.032
Is my husband in some kind of trouble?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.032
Agent Navabi.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.713
What's in here, Mrs. Grant?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.917
- Edgar's antiques.
- Antiques?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.839
He's a collector.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.753
Garage and estate sales.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.277
It's where he dillydallies. His workshop.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.558
Edgar says
the collection's quite valuable.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.040
- Hey, it's me. Is everything okay?
- Under control.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.477
Red's people took Agnes
and her nanny to the safehouse.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.791
I'm headed there now.
I just have to pack a bag.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.952
- What's going on?
- We found his place.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.318
This guy, Liz,
he's a special kind of strange.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.955
Take photos. I wanna see everything.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.432
Hey, let me call you back
when I get to the safehouse. Bye.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.400
Don't move.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.552
Just be still.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.997
I'd like to ask you to turn around.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.753
Very slowly.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.233
That's it.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.040
- Reddington.
- It's true. Agnes is safe with my people.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.876
But it appears the Debt Collector
grabbed Elizabeth before she made it.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.111
We're getting the word out.
Local and federal.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.437
How'd this happen?
Thought you were protecting her.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.273
<i>- So did I.
- It had to be Kaplan.</i>

16:57.440 --> 17:00.831
She must have hired the Debt Collector
and told him where to find Keen...

17:01.080 --> 17:04.232
...which makes no sense.
She helped us to identify a suspect.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.279
His name is Edgar Grant.
A janitor at a public middle school.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.589
<i>- Do you have him?
- No...</i>

17:08.760 --> 17:10.955
...but Navabi and a TAC team
are at his home.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.760
I don't believe Kaplan is behind this.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.195
We're not seeing the whole picture.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.154
Find your suspect and do it fast
before he collects on...

17:19.359 --> 17:21.795
...whatever debt
Elizabeth allegedly owes.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.513
<i>- Where are you?
- Traveling.</i>

17:23.720 --> 17:25.915
I'll do what I can,
but my reach is limited.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.954
You need to find Elizabeth, Harold.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.035
Listen to me, Edgar.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.239
That's your name, isn't it?

17:38.400 --> 17:39.550
Edgar Grant?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.479
How do you know that?

17:41.920 --> 17:45.357
The FBI raided your house this morning.
So if you hurt me...

17:45.520 --> 17:49.400
...you'll only make it worse for yourself
and your family when you're arrested.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.278
- Why you doing this? You don't know me.
- I'm a debt collector.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.320
My client wants what you owe him,
and he hired me to make you pay.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.039
- Who?
- Your old friend.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.759
Tyson Pryor.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.913
Tyson Pryor is in prison.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.794
- Why would you wanna help him?
- Like I said, it's my job.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.600
Things got a little rough
for Mr. Pryor in prison.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.231
His face got disfigured
because of a faulty deep fryer...

18:12.440 --> 18:15.160
...while he's doing kitchen duty.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.350
So that's my fault?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.989
He wants to kill me because
he had a rough go inside?

18:19.200 --> 18:21.237
Kill you?
Nobody said anything about killing.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.551
My instructions
were not to harm a hair...

18:23.720 --> 18:25.837
...on your pretty little head...

18:26.040 --> 18:27.872
...until he's present.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.876
<i>So it's him.
Edgar Grant is the Debt Collector.</i>

18:33.040 --> 18:35.999
Definitely. He keeps the items
he's collected in his basement...

18:36.160 --> 18:38.880
...along with detailed specs
on each object.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.920
A pair of hands taken from a man
who physically abused his wife.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.391
An eye from a witness
who supposedly made a false ID.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.000
<i>- It's all body parts?
- No.</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:51.676
Paintings, cash. He doesn't give what
he takes to the person who hired him.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.959
He keeps them for himself.
What they get is revenge.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.760
Satisfaction of knowing that
their debt has been repaid.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.992
Agent Navabi, you asked about
anything relating to Elizabeth Keen?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.359
I think we might have something.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.672
Please tell me it's something
we can use to track this guy.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.520
No, not him.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.800
But maybe this psycho
who hired him to grab Liz.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.475
What do we know about Tyson Pryor?

19:20.760 --> 19:25.357
In 2012, eight envelopes were sent and
delivered by the U.S. Postal Service...

19:25.560 --> 19:27.791
...to the president of eight universities.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.794
Inside the envelopes
were blank pages...

19:30.960 --> 19:32.872
...and highly lethal doses of anthrax.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.111
Yeah, I remember.
It was a huge news story.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.873
<i>Three of the targeted were killed.</i>

19:37.040 --> 19:40.238
<i>Three more spent time
in intensive care but survived.</i>

19:40.400 --> 19:44.155
<i>Bureau launched a manhunt for
the individual or individuals responsible.</i>

19:44.320 --> 19:47.154
<i>Ultimately, the case was solved
by a young FBI profiler...</i>

19:47.320 --> 19:49.596
- ...who was on the New York Psych Unit.
- Liz.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.639
Keen's profile led to the arrest
of one Tyson Pryor.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.350
A sociology professor at one of the
schools who was angry at his president...

19:56.520 --> 19:58.716
- ...because he was denied tenure.
- He was sentenced to life.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.197
He was, but according to the Bureau
of Prisons, he has terminal cancer.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.797
Pryor was granted release
to a hospice in Baltimore two weeks ago.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.237
That's why he hired the Debt Collector,
to get revenge before he dies.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.629
Navabi, get to Pryor.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.315
He's gotta know a way to find this guy.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.473
Mr. Gerard,
I'm Special Agent Julian Gale.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.313
This is Special Agent Ressler.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.319
Yes. Agent Ressler.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.631
Wait, wait. You two know each other?

20:26.800 --> 20:30.032
Well, Donald was the public face
of the manhunt for Raymond.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.157
When he was on the run
with Elizabeth Keen.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.232
Everyone in my world
knows Donald Ressler.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.437
- We're here to make a deal with you.
- If there's a deal to make...

20:40.600 --> 20:42.353
...I'll make it with Agent Ressler.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.835
Yeah, that's not happening.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.960
During the manhunt, I watched
Agent Ressler's press briefings.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.237
He was smug, arrogant...

20:50.400 --> 20:52.039
...and professional.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.910
You, my friend,
just seem smug and arrogant.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.271
- You may go.
- Listen, pal.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.314
You don't get to decide
who stays, who goes.

21:01.480 --> 21:05.633
Nope. Only whether to talk or not.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.274
Well, I'll just be right outside, then.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.753
Have a nice chat, Mr. Gerard.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.399
- Seemed to go well.
- What was that?

21:24.560 --> 21:27.120
- He doesn't know.
- Clearly, you wanna keep it that way.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.351
Which is why there is
a deal to be made.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.594
You get me out,
and I keep my mouth shut.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.274
A deal requires that you talk.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.234
No. A deal requires that I cooperate...

21:37.440 --> 21:39.432
...which in this case means not to talk.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.838
So if we say no, what, are you gonna
betray Reddington? No way.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.037
When it comes to self-preservation...

21:45.240 --> 21:48.916
...there is only one person
that I am more devoted to than Raymond.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.077
And you're looking at him.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.631
My freedom for my silence...

21:53.800 --> 21:56.269
...or I tell Agent Gale...

21:56.720 --> 22:00.714
...the truth about why
you and I are such great pals.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.951
I did what you requested, Raymond.
The FBI has my findings.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.157
She's gone, Kate.
Elizabeth's been taken.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.269
<i>- How?
- You tell me. Her home was breached.</i>

22:11.440 --> 22:13.272
Whatever our issues...

22:13.440 --> 22:15.432
<i>...please tell me...
- If she's in danger...</i>

22:15.640 --> 22:16.915
...you know it's not me.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.676
You may not have ordered her taken,
but because of you, I am here.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.958
- If Elizabeth is harmed because of this...
- I gave the FBI a name.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.840
Yes, Edgar Grant, and the FBI
is doing everything they can.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.196
But he's already got her.
Whatever it takes...

22:29.360 --> 22:33.718
...whatever you need,
this conflict of ours can wait.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.752
Goodbye, Raymond.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.471
Please, I assure you,
none of this is necessary.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.395
Tyson Pryor has killed a number of
people already. I need you to stay here.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.670
FBI.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.594
Put your hands in the air,
and turn around slowly.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.991
You're having doubts.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.959
I am.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.598
I haven't loved many people in my life.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.631
Kate is one of them.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.591
You know, as much as her betrayal hurt,
what really hurt was...

23:19.880 --> 23:22.918
...knowing what I would have to do
in response.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.797
She was wrong to think
Elizabeth and her child were safer...

23:27.960 --> 23:30.953
...without me in their lives,
but in the end, she was...

23:32.040 --> 23:34.600
She did what she did out of love...

23:34.760 --> 23:38.231
...for the little girl
she swore to protect, what...

23:39.880 --> 23:42.190
...seems like a lifetime ago.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.831
It broke my heart...

23:53.280 --> 23:54.953
...that day in the woods...

23:56.280 --> 23:58.476
...hearing the gunshot...

23:58.680 --> 24:00.831
...leaving her behind.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.477
Right or wrong,
it was between you and her.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.798
This war she started must stop.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.555
Kate must be stopped.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.193
I agree.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.157
I'm just not at all sure of the right way.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.552
And, depending on the way,
whether I'd be up to it.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.755
I need to look her in the face
and see if I still recognize her.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.395
Raymond, she has gone too far.

24:41.400 --> 24:45.189
All to prove that you have gone too far.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.839
She can't see what she's become.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.077
What if I'm the one who can't see?

24:54.240 --> 24:55.469
No, Raymond.

24:56.360 --> 25:00.798
Remember why you surrendered
yourself to the FBI in the first place.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.078
Remember what all of this was about.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.799
You can't give up now.

25:06.440 --> 25:11.117
You can't let Kate destroy everything
that gives you purpose.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.634
Our work is not yet done.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.997
I loved Kate too.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.237
But it's time to end this.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.119
Stop it.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.039
Stop her.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.400
I got nothing.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.159
- You tell him he could walk?
- Yeah.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.789
Keys to the kingdom,
and he says no deal.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.155
He won't talk.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.555
- Is that a fact?
- Don't believe me? Wanna talk to him?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.758
I'd love to,
except he insisted on talking to you...

25:57.920 --> 25:59.240
...alone.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.278
What are you suggesting here, Julian?

26:01.440 --> 26:04.080
I'm suggesting the two of you
know each other.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.153
- You're nuts.
- Nuts or...

26:07.560 --> 26:09.552
...am I just blind
to what's in front of me?

26:10.040 --> 26:11.440
Don't go there.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.478
When I mentioned
Reddington's cleaner...

26:13.640 --> 26:15.438
...you knew it was a woman.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.080
You were Keen's partner.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.390
Let me ask you something.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.950
- Where did you disappear to?
- I was working a case.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.919
Right, right, right.
You were brainwashed, right?

26:24.120 --> 26:26.112
I mean, is that really your cover story...?

26:26.320 --> 26:28.880
- That's the story. Okay, Julian?
- Yeah.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.272
I shot a Secret Service agent
because of it, and they were holding me.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.477
That's where I've been.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.915
Do not doubt me.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.994
Ever.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.880
You got that?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.432
Loud and clear.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.758
Elizabeth Keen, where is she?

26:45.920 --> 26:48.151
Burning in hell, for all I care.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.472
- Who are you?
- Part of a team that doesn't exist...

26:51.640 --> 26:54.394
...which makes you
a very unlucky man, Mr. Pryor.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.994
Because I can do...

26:56.160 --> 26:57.753
...whatever I want in this room.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.589
No one will stop me.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.235
Lady, I just got out of prison
two weeks ago.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.960
Where you were overheard
swearing revenge on Elizabeth.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.636
Every day to anybody
who would listen.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.912
They put me in
maximum-security prison.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.274
Do you know what they do
to guys who look like me?

27:16.440 --> 27:19.512
I'm nothing but busted parts,
thanks to that woman.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.593
Which explains why you had
her abducted. Now, where is she?

27:22.760 --> 27:24.672
Keen's been taken?

27:25.760 --> 27:28.116
I thought the sky
looked bluer this morning.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.357
You can drop the act, Tyson.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.240
We found this in the home
of the man you hired.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.189
Detailed correspondence between you
and a man known as the Debt Collector.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.238
Proof that you paid him
to abduct Keen.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.236
Well, I don't know what that is,
but it ain't proof.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.950
- Because I didn't do noth...
- Where did he take her?

27:46.120 --> 27:48.271
I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.638
- Where is she?
- How would I get money for a computer?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.029
Much less a hit man.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.356
I got a wife, you know.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.598
Joyce. She was a dancer.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.911
Until a drunk driver hit her
and took her legs.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.194
Six years
for aggravated vehicular assault.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.431
Out in four for good behavior.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.393
Don't seem fair, now, does it?

28:13.560 --> 28:15.119
Let me guess, you killed him.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.636
No, no, no.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.554
When that trucker got paroled,
I tied him up...

28:20.760 --> 28:24.913
...pounded his legs into meat
with a sledgehammer.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.355
Recompense.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.273
So you see yourself as a crusader?

28:28.440 --> 28:31.035
Oh, heavens, no.
I'm a sociopath, clearly.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.914
It turns out I enjoy inflicting pain,
and I'm very good at it.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.830
But there's not really a market
for open sadism.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.476
Crimes of revenge, on the other hand?

28:43.280 --> 28:44.634
Now, there's a gold mine.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.190
And Tyson Pryor...

28:47.480 --> 28:50.678
...he's gonna get his money's worth.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.033
<i>- Can I help you?
- Ms. Brady Boatright.</i>

28:55.200 --> 28:57.396
I'm here to sub sixth grade,
I believe.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.394
<i>Come on in. Sign in at the office.</i>

29:39.000 --> 29:41.151
Yeah, I posted it,
and I'm not taking it down.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.154
- Ike, she's super upset.
- What do I care? Not my problem.

29:45.320 --> 29:49.109
Please delete the post. She said
she's not coming back to school.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.192
You say that like it's a bad thing.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.230
I'm so sorry.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.314
Young man. Young man.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.069
Cyberbullying is grounds for expulsion.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.836
- I didn't do anything.
- You're gonna take that post down.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.196
What are you gonna do?
Send me to the principal?

30:08.360 --> 30:11.797
No, son.
I'm gonna send you to the morgue.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.996
Delete the post.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.720
Do it.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.198
Hey, looks like the gang's all here.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.634
Come on.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.637
<i>I know where the Debt Collector's
taking her.</i>

30:48.800 --> 30:50.200
Have you called Harold Cooper?

30:50.360 --> 30:53.478
To arrest me? No. They've already
double-crossed me once today.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.630
<i>Then call my people.</i>

30:54.800 --> 30:56.632
Your people will kill me on sight.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.237
Pryor? Where are you?

31:03.440 --> 31:07.673
I got a young lady here
who's dying to get reacquainted.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.990
- There you go.
- We're talking about Elizabeth.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.152
I guarantee you won't be harmed.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.438
I'm closer than your people and the FBI.
I'm handling this myself.

31:16.680 --> 31:19.115
<i>- If something goes wrong...
- You'll what?</i>

31:19.320 --> 31:21.551
Shoot me again?

31:21.760 --> 31:24.036
Please be careful, Kate.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.829
- No need for alarm, Edgar.
- Who are you?

31:41.640 --> 31:43.518
Where's Tyson Pryor?

31:43.720 --> 31:46.872
I'm sorry to have misled you,
but Tyson Pryor didn't hire you.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.753
I did.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.749
Hello, Elizabeth.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.992
Sir, I could be wrong, but I think
I might know where Agent Keen is.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.470
Some kids at Horizon
reported seeing a woman...

32:09.640 --> 32:12.951
...matching Mr. Kaplan's description.
She was holding a key that said...

32:13.160 --> 32:16.039
...Troop 14441.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.471
And their old cabin
is on Johnson Lake.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.240
Get me
the local authorities on the line.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.270
Who are you?

32:30.480 --> 32:32.039
What do you want?

32:32.240 --> 32:33.720
From you?

32:33.880 --> 32:36.918
- Nothing.
- This is all about getting to Kaplan.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.960
Yes. By taking advantage
of her love for you.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.032
The only emotion powerful enough
to get her to...

32:45.200 --> 32:48.511
...set aside the rage that consumes her.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.589
A rage that I'm not sure...

32:51.840 --> 32:53.672
...she'll ever recover from.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.470
I didn't hurt her.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.597
That must have been
dissatisfying for you.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.673
You're a glutton for vengeance.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.435
I understand.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.554
There's almost nothing
as satisfying as revenge.

33:13.800 --> 33:17.237
Wanting someone to hurt
because you hurt.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.916
An eye for an eye.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.036
Feels like God's work.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.871
Until you realize there is no God...

33:26.040 --> 33:29.636
...and you've committed sins
for which there is no absolution.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.833
I just did what you asked.
Nothing more.

33:33.480 --> 33:37.394
Word to the wise, before you embark
on a journey of revenge...

33:38.040 --> 33:39.394
...dig two graves.

33:43.480 --> 33:47.838
Confucius. Stunningly applicable,
even after all these years.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.999
Two graves?

33:50.200 --> 33:52.840
Is the other one for you or for Kaplan?

33:53.040 --> 33:54.838
Neither, I hope.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.592
That's up to her.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.039
ID'd all but six of the John Does.
Nice work.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.193
I guess being a monomaniacal prick
has its benefits.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.154
You're all that,
except for the monomaniacal part.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.831
- Ressler.
- Liz is in trouble.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.117
<i>- Talk to me.
- I know where she is. Got backup.</i>

34:21.280 --> 34:23.476
But you need to be there.
Forget the suspension.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.871
Look, just text me the address,
all right?

34:27.080 --> 34:28.150
It's...

34:28.320 --> 34:30.277
- It's another case.
- Don't have to explain.

34:30.920 --> 34:35.391
What I said before, I didn't mean it. No
one's worked harder to find Reddington.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.074
I'm sorry.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.152
- Forget about it. It's all good.
- All right.

34:44.719 --> 34:45.835
You lied.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.913
You said you were trapped
in steerage on a ship.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.393
I thought I was...

34:52.400 --> 34:55.632
...until I was able to trade
my last supply routes in the Balkans...

34:55.800 --> 34:58.759
...for a ride on Prince Hajjar's jet.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.557
You had me kidnapped.

35:01.800 --> 35:05.635
- You put Agnes at risk.
- Agnes was never at risk.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.590
And I gave explicit instructions
you were not to be harmed in any way.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.753
Untie me.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.996
I said, untie me.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.552
I wish I could.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.959
She's on her way here now
thinking she's gonna save me.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.597
- I assume so, yes.
- And you're gonna kill her.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.595
As I said, that's entirely up to her.
I wanna believe there's another way.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.150
After everything that's happened?

35:34.560 --> 35:36.677
What could she possibly say
to convince you?

35:36.840 --> 35:39.355
She doesn't have to convince me.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.880
You already did that.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.400
But for a war to end, both sides
have to be willing to find peace.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.550
And up until now...

35:46.720 --> 35:49.838
...it seems Kate has believed
the only satisfactory outcome...

35:50.040 --> 35:51.952
...would be if one of us dies.

35:52.520 --> 35:55.718
If that's true, it has to be her.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.238
She's here.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.239
Reddington, don't do this.

36:11.120 --> 36:14.033
Thank you for coming, Cliff.
We believe Elizabeth's inside.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.873
One unsub, likely armed.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.673
The men are in position.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.520
She brought a lot of backup.
This gonna be a problem?

36:20.680 --> 36:23.036
No, sir.
This will not be a problem. Over.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.993
There has to be another way.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.998
<i>- Please don't do this.
- We move quickly.</i>

36:27.640 --> 36:30.030
Two men from the south.
Two from the north.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.636
I count five body men plus our Betty.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.069
Betty's on the move.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.273
I can take the two
at Betty's 6 and 9 from my perch.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.193
- Ricardo?
- Copy that.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.199
<i>- I can take the big one at her 1 and 3.
- On my command...</i>

36:46.360 --> 36:49.990
...fire only if you have a clean shot.
Remember, she is not to be harmed.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.800
Kaplan, no. It's a trap.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.914
Raymond.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.632
We've been set up.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.554
I got eyes on a grass man,
60 yards out.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.632
There's another
on our wing to the south.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.438
No. Don't shoot.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.871
I'm made.
I can take one shot. Maybe two.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.190
<i>- On your ready.
- Hold.</i>

37:18.360 --> 37:20.113
Repeat. I can take the Betty now.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.590
- Right now. One shot.
- No. Hold.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.915
They've got overwatch.

37:26.080 --> 37:29.471
- I count three.
- Everyone, hold your positions.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.560
Hello, Raymond.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.558
Said the fly to the spider.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.239
We go where our hearts take us.
Yours took you to Elizabeth.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.357
And yours kidnapped her.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.797
Thank you, Raymond, for proving
my point better than I ever could.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.879
You underestimate yourself, Kate.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.278
The deaths you've caused
in the name of crippling me...

38:10.440 --> 38:13.558
...have been more than adequate
to prove what you've become.

38:14.240 --> 38:17.517
I've watched you hold Elizabeth
emotionally hostage.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.037
I never thought you'd hold her
physically hostage as well.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.358
I wanted her here to bear witness.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.957
I regret any hardship it caused her,
but I believe, in the end...

38:28.120 --> 38:31.272
...she'll agree it's a small price
to pay for the truth.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.514
I was your friend.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.032
I protected you.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.430
I comforted you.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.916
I loved you.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.234
The truth?

38:50.800 --> 38:52.757
This is the truth.

38:53.440 --> 38:57.354
And it came
at an excruciatingly high price.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.476
What he did is indefensible.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.475
But it's done. And it can't be changed.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.917
What matters is now. The truth today.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.357
And that is Reddington
has given me his word...

39:13.160 --> 39:15.470
...that he can coexist with you.

39:17.360 --> 39:21.274
Will you give me your word
that you can coexist with him?

39:24.280 --> 39:25.714
No.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.832
Because I can't.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.796
FBI. Hands in the air.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.834
There are snipers in the trees.
I count at least two.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.435
Bring them out. Do it. Both of you.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.911
I'll show you mine
if she'll show you hers.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.233
- The Debt Collector.
- Is dead.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.910
Reddington hired him to lure her out.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.870
I gave you 86 victims,
and you're arresting me?

40:05.720 --> 40:07.200
I don't know what to say.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.591
Because you've already said it, dearie.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.553
When you called out to warn me.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.513
To protect me.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.195
From him.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.599
Stop. Don't shoot.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.236
Stand down, stand down.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.197
<i>- Any sign of Kate?
- Nothing yet.</i>

41:08.440 --> 41:10.397
A search party is still on-site.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.513
<i>You let her get away.</i>

41:12.720 --> 41:14.473
<i>I couldn't stop her.</i>

41:14.640 --> 41:17.838
Well, you heard it yourself. Her truth.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.071
That we cannot coexist.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.837
We ran the ballistics.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.236
Kaplan's men didn't take that shot.

41:25.800 --> 41:28.634
So we have a new actor in the mix.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.354
Hey, Donnie.

41:36.440 --> 41:37.920
So?

41:38.680 --> 41:41.479
- Any luck on that case you mentioned?
- No.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.717
Two steps forward and three back.

41:44.720 --> 41:47.076
I know exactly how that feels.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.276
<i>A new actor.</i>

41:48.520 --> 41:50.751
How is that even possible?

41:51.200 --> 41:52.873
Nobody knew
you were at that cabin.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.434
No.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.238
That's what makes our mystery guest
so intriguing.

41:58.440 --> 42:02.719
I know Mr. Kaplan said that
the two of you can't coexist. That...

42:03.160 --> 42:06.710
That was her truth,
but I still hope it can change.

42:06.960 --> 42:11.000
I have found, in my experience,
people rarely change.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.192
And when they do...

42:13.640 --> 42:15.632
...they're not to be trusted.
