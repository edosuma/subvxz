WEBVTT

00:50.592 --> 00:52.263
- You're late tonight, sir.

00:52.264 --> 00:55.356
- In all the years coming here,
I've never told you my name.

00:55.357 --> 00:57.181
It's Walter.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.650
It would make me so happy
if you called me that

00:58.651 --> 01:00.142
Walter.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.686
- Ignacio.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.149
Good evening.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.528
- The allure of that never
fades, I'm happy to report.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.823
Couple of bunches of hydrangeas?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.283
- You got it.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.088
- Yeah, your dog is cute.
- Very cute.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.307
Hey, gentlemen,
how you doing tonight?

01:36.308 --> 01:39.646
Can you help out a Marine Corps
veteran get something to eat?

01:39.647 --> 01:42.645
I did eight months straight
in Fallujah, man.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.042
Just trying
to stay warm like you.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.385
- Yo, mister,
let me get 50¢, man.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.180
- I'll get you a cup of coffee.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.349
- I want 50¢.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.600
<i>- Sorry.</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:28.316
Maybe you should let these
young ladies get their dog.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.804
- Have a good night, Walter.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.430
- Good night, Ignacio.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.193
- You've got to be kidding me.

03:12.194 --> 03:14.661
- Just ignore it.
- That is not in my nature.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.579
<i>- Yes?
- Help me!</i>

03:25.580 --> 03:28.124
- Sam?
- No, it might be a trick.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.002
- Who is this?
- What's happening?

03:30.003 --> 03:32.670
- <i>Help</i> me!
- I'm buzzing you in.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.843
Get down there,
I'm gonna call 911.

03:33.844 --> 03:35.216
- Not a chance.
- Then I'm going.

03:35.217 --> 03:36.967
- Okay, okay, okay,
all right, fine.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.615
What is that?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.040
Oh, hell.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.502
Senseless.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.130
Perfectly senseless.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.466
My wife.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.551
- Call 911!
- I already did.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.552
Jesus.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.805
- It's okay, the ambulance
is on its way.

04:22.806 --> 04:24.138
Just hang in there.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.015
- Make sure she gets this.
- Jesus!

04:27.517 --> 04:30.352
- Her name is Marcia.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.946
- Shit, there's another guy
out here!

04:32.939 --> 04:35.191
- Don't let go.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.234
- I'm here.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.986
- I was just...

05:15.732 --> 05:19.485
A thinker who predates
Darwin and dares suggest

05:19.486 --> 05:21.705
that an objective analysis
of what it is

05:21.706 --> 05:23.489
to live as a human,

05:23.490 --> 05:26.033
a thinking, sentient being

05:26.034 --> 05:30.204
whose sole trajectory
is toward the grave,

05:30.205 --> 05:33.084
particularly once
children have been reared,

05:33.085 --> 05:35.876
would have us perhaps choose

05:35.877 --> 05:38.346
not to be born at all.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.632
Imagine that.

05:41.633 --> 05:46.387
Better not to live
than to live and suffer.

05:46.388 --> 05:50.307
But Eros seduces us
not only into striving

05:50.308 --> 05:54.019
for the falsely ethereal,
but worse,

05:54.020 --> 05:55.312
propagating.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.657
And thereby subjecting
another generation

05:57.658 --> 06:00.651
to the same suffering we endure.

06:00.652 --> 06:01.735
In short,

06:01.736 --> 06:04.864
to love and reproduce

06:04.865 --> 06:08.409
is at some level
a sinister enterprise

06:08.410 --> 06:12.705
because we deposit offspring
into such a shitty world.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.291
Any way you look at it,

06:15.292 --> 06:17.293
grim stuff.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.217
<i>So...</i>

06:21.631 --> 06:23.716
Friday then.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.935
Just ten years ago,
I was certain the answer was no.

06:32.936 --> 06:34.356
The Greeks had it right.

06:34.357 --> 06:36.604
We're just atoms.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.652
But who knows?

06:38.648 --> 06:41.527
In your lifetime,
not mine, thank goodness,

06:41.528 --> 06:43.447
we'll perhaps become immortal.

06:43.448 --> 06:45.116
- You believe in that stuff?

06:45.117 --> 06:46.447
- Our thoughts anyway.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.448
Measurable in bits.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.794
Everything reducible to
two symbols or their absence.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.870
I used to believe in nothing.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.465
New I believe in everything.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.462
My problem is how all this
degrades our appetite

06:59.463 --> 07:01.714
to keep asking
what it could all mean.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.138
Jill might have cancer.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.348
- Might?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.975
- A lesion on
one of her ovaries.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.895
Does your mother know?

07:17.896 --> 07:20.439
- We're not telling her yet.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.316
- This puts me in a very odd-

07:22.317 --> 07:24.866
- Dad. is that really
gonna be your response?

07:24.867 --> 07:26.987
- Of course not, Adam.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.572
What can we do?

07:28.573 --> 07:32.159
- She doesn't want me telling
anyone, so...

07:32.160 --> 07:35.329
this conversation is-

07:35.330 --> 07:37.458
it's nothing personal,
she just doesn't want people-

07:37.459 --> 07:39.458
- No need to explain.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.752
- I just...

07:41.753 --> 07:43.471
- I'm here, Adam.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.173
Always.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.727
- Oh, my God.
- She didn't.

07:53.728 --> 07:55.683
- That's amazing.

07:57.232 --> 07:58.560
- <i>On.</i>

08:07.779 --> 08:10.202
- I told her, but she's like,
"You promised me,"

08:10.203 --> 08:12.324
so I'm hosed.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.123
- What-what if I need that?

08:14.124 --> 08:15.869
- What?
- The chair.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.122
- Oh, sorry.
- Uh, hold on a second.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.421
Dude, how many
tickets do you have?

08:20.422 --> 08:22.793
Fuck you.
No way.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.128
- Excuse me.
- Hold on.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.129
I said hold on.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.594
Can I just have this chair

08:26.595 --> 08:28.760
until whoever
you're waiting for gets here?

08:28.761 --> 08:31.010
- I didn't say that
I was waiting for anyone.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.010
- Okay, I get it.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.804
Excuse me,
may I please have this chair?

08:34.806 --> 08:36.399
- Why didn't you just
ask in the first place?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.267
- Dude, just buy the ticket
and I'll deal.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.894
No, I don't want pay for two.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.066
I need this chair
and you clearly don't.

08:43.067 --> 08:45.487
- Who are you
to determine what I need?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.574
- All right, you keep
your fucking chair.

08:48.575 --> 08:50.034
It's the only empty seat
in here,

08:50.035 --> 08:52.908
but you could stare at it while
you're killing fucking trees.

08:52.909 --> 08:54.375
- My book is used.
- Yeah?

08:54.376 --> 08:57.369
Well, you're a selfish,
lonely bitch.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.663
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.664
- Dude.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.498
- He already knows his
multiplication tables.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.127
- The thing about Bobby
is he's an auditory learner

09:37.128 --> 09:38.702
more than a visual one.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.414
- Come on, Marta.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.960
You're really gonna choose now

09:43.961 --> 09:46.460
to talk about your precious
little Bobby?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.964
There's a line!

09:55.345 --> 09:58.514
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:58.515 --> 10:00.438
Did you honk at me, Sarah?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.104
- I did, Marta.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.154
- Un-fucking-believable.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.573
And what if I needed
to speak to Joan?

10:12.574 --> 10:13.695
- You could email her.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.617
- Maybe I need
to speak with her in person

10:15.618 --> 10:17.579
because my son
is having trouble.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.660
- Hire a tutor
like the rest of us.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.208
- How do I know what to say
to the tutor

10:21.209 --> 10:23.413
if I can't speak to his teacher?

10:23.414 --> 10:25.129
- Which brings us back to email.

10:25.130 --> 10:26.593
- I learn more in person.

10:26.594 --> 10:28.710
Inflections.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.505
Like I'm learning
what a shrew you are right now.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.506
- Shrew?

10:32.507 --> 10:35.010
- I wouldn't get the full effect
in written text.

10:35.011 --> 10:36.510
- Did you just say shrew?

10:37.559 --> 10:39.096
- Fuck off, Jane!

10:39.097 --> 10:41.598
- Marta,

10:41.599 --> 10:42.691
why don't you email me?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.394
- Imagine that.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.521
- You're a cunt, Sarah.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.866
Honk at me again
and I'll deck you.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.779
Just get me to 5:00.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.999
- Hi, Mommy.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.718
- Hey!
- Here you go, Angie.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.177
- You do the math yet?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.053
No, I'll just ask Hal.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.273
Because he's a fucking genius.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.685
Hal, I can't figure out this-
Jesus!

11:26.686 --> 11:27.938
- Get the fuck out!
- Look your door.

11:27.939 --> 11:30.486
- I said get out.
- This is why we have locks.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.531
- Really?
- Are you seriously still here?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.702
- Help me with this
problem, sicko.

11:40.703 --> 11:41.701
- Call one of your-
- I did.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.702
None of them have done it.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.373
- None of them has done it.
- Eat me.

11:44.374 --> 11:45.587
- Incest is taboo.
- Give me.

11:45.588 --> 11:47.915
- Not with your jizz hands.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.001
"Find the ratio of radius
to circumference"-

11:51.002 --> 11:53.629
- It should never deviate.
It's pi r to pi r squared.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.255
- Oh, right.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.593
That's so easy.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.098
- Have you and Amy ever...

12:05.099 --> 12:06.146
I mean, have you guys...

12:06.147 --> 12:07.643
- I wish.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.487
- There's always
Holocaust literature.

12:09.488 --> 12:11.355
- Fuck you.
- I wasn't even-

12:11.356 --> 12:13.320
- Wailing <i>away</i> reading
about the six million?

12:13.321 --> 12:15.569
- We will pursue this
no further.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.697
What about you?

12:20.698 --> 12:23.495
- I would have with Lucas,
but he never tried,

12:23.496 --> 12:26.087
and I didn't want to
come off like a slut.

12:26.088 --> 12:27.788
- Idiot.

12:27.789 --> 12:28.997
- Me or Lucas?

12:28.998 --> 12:29.998
- Both.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.093
- You think I should have
lost it to that douche bag?

12:32.094 --> 12:33.302
- He is a douche bag.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.712
- Thanks for telling me.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.386
- I hate all the guys
who want to fuck you.

12:37.387 --> 12:39.341
- I just said he didn't
want to fuck me.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.302
- Did you blow him?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.887
- Has Amy blown you?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.597
- I asked you first.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.432
Yes.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.980
You had Lucas Rapp's tool
in your mouth?

12:48.981 --> 12:50.102
- Okay, enough.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.696
- And he never tried
to fuck you.

12:51.697 --> 12:53.021
- Never.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.398
- So he's gay.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.191
- Maybe.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.442
Has Amy ever-

12:57.443 --> 12:58.485
- Hand job.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.739
- Were you thinking
about Anne Frank?

13:01.740 --> 13:03.286
Watching footage of
The Long March.

13:03.287 --> 13:04.825
- What?

13:04.826 --> 13:06.618
How do you know this shit?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.036
You're a fucking freak.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.176
- Imagine if all the people
who built these brownstones

13:14.177 --> 13:15.294
could see the city now.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.463
- Mm.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.383
- It's our ruin or our nirvana.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.386
- What's that supposed to mean?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.847
- Either we'll extinguish
ourselves

13:26.848 --> 13:27.973
or become God.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.227
- Jesus, Hal.
- What else is there?

13:42.030 --> 13:44.364
- You can still write.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.208
- Shit don't go away.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.705
Just don't nobody
want to read it.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.206
Monica know you down here?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.925
- We broke up over a year ago.

13:54.926 --> 13:56.965
- Mission on your own then?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.004
- Maybe.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.380
- Fuck that supposed to mean?

14:00.381 --> 14:01.757
Bringing your obliquity
up in here?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.180
This ain't no
motherfucking courtroom.

14:03.181 --> 14:05.177
- Just finish up.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.054
- Look at that.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.853
Boy in the day...

14:10.308 --> 14:12.106
Girl at night.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.611
Ah.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.659
Nothing better.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.708
- I have a friend outside
that's going to join us.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.452
- Friend?
- What kind of friend?

14:30.453 --> 14:33.330
- Helps out
with this sort of thing.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.082
- Sort of thing?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.381
- I'm going to open the door.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.762
- Hello there.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.639
- What's going on, Jeffrey?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.105
- Jeffrey has asked me to help
to get you some help.

14:53.106 --> 14:54.478
- You a fucking narc?

14:54.479 --> 14:57.187
- I spoke to Dr. Barnes.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.608
- And who told my man
about Dr. Barnes?

14:58.609 --> 14:59.609
- Your father.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.069
- Fuck you, man.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.363
- Hey Joe.
- Joe, where you going, huh?

15:06.364 --> 15:07.364
Hey. hey, hey, hey!

15:07.365 --> 15:09.157
- No!
- Fuck you, Jeffrey!

15:09.158 --> 15:12.411
Fuck you,
fucking narc ass motherfucker!

15:12.412 --> 15:14.079
- Here's what happens
in the next hour!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.126
We pack you up, go to your
doctor, and him and you talk.

15:16.127 --> 15:17.125
- Man, you got to have
an appointment

15:17.126 --> 15:18.126
to see that motherfucker!

15:18.127 --> 15:19.127
- And what he say to do,
you gonna do.

15:19.128 --> 15:22.879
- Do as I please.
- I done took away that right.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.381
- Man, I'm gonna see the police,
I'm gonna tell them-

15:24.382 --> 15:25.971
I'm gonna tell them
you kidnapping me.

15:25.972 --> 15:28.345
- I know every police
in this precinct.

15:28.346 --> 15:31.348
Get you locked up on possession,
take days to even think about

15:31.349 --> 15:33.098
remembering to give you
a phone call.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.017
So what you gonna do,
the-the jail route

15:36.018 --> 15:37.816
or the doctor route?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.535
<i>- I needed to tell someone.</i>

15:53.536 --> 15:54.953
- By all means.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.833
- Look, the last thing
I wanted was for you to-

15:57.834 --> 15:59.505
- Then-then why do you
do specifically

15:59.506 --> 16:01.918
what I ask you not to do?

16:01.919 --> 16:06.923
- Because I am scared
and bewildered and confused.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.676
- What do you think I am?

16:12.889 --> 16:14.306
- If he says it's...

16:14.307 --> 16:15.932
- Then we tell them.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.101
- How?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.854
When?
What does one even-

16:21.814 --> 16:24.065
This is what I am talking about.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.615
Why I wanted to speak to someone
who's been a parent,

16:26.616 --> 16:30.241
my parent who knows our kids.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.285
- Ms. Zarrow.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.464
- Is this at all related
to the fertility?

16:44.465 --> 16:46.129
- Adam asked the same question.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.383
There are some studies that
suggest a connection between

16:48.384 --> 16:50.096
progesterone and ovarian cancer,

16:50.097 --> 16:52.344
but a large majority
of them makes none.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.723
The truth of the matter is
we won't know for a couple

16:54.724 --> 16:58.020
of decades given the uptick
in the use of those drugs.

16:58.021 --> 16:59.559
- It will have been worth it.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
- Let's not go there.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.438
- I'm gonna have to agree
with your husband.

17:04.106 --> 17:07.233
Dr. Nachtagal will assist
He is extraordinary.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.359
- And it's...

17:08.361 --> 17:09.361
- Friday.
- Friday.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.488
- The earliest I could get.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.255
- Uh, Jill, Adam?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.221
- Hi, Ray.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.340
- You guys have
a couple of minutes?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.387
- We leaking on you again?
- No, and I got your check

17:32.388 --> 17:33.386
- I'm gonna go up
if that's okay.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.387
- Yeah.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.228
- This will just take a couple
of minutes, I promise.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.474
- Really, Ray,
it's not a good time.

17:37.475 --> 17:39.316
- It's about your kids.

17:42.817 --> 17:45.440
- What's of course hypocritical
is we're all alike.

17:45.441 --> 17:46.565
- How's that?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.609
- Over-educated,
irrepressibly ambitious.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.407
Moved out to the suburbs,
thought it would be perfect,

17:52.408 --> 17:55.577
but without the bank
or the law firm or whatever,

17:55.578 --> 17:58.078
what's left but to polish
our children

17:58.079 --> 18:01.788
and obsess over
every little offense?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.415
More?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.464
- I think I'll switch to wine.

18:05.465 --> 18:08.378
- Stems are in the left cabinet.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.679
You know her math-challenged son
already says he's going

18:11.680 --> 18:13.133
to Mommy's college?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.727
- What college?
- Princeton.

18:14.728 --> 18:16.136
- Of course.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.764
- It's utterly heinous,
the level of entitlement.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.811
As if I would already know that
Allie and Angie

18:21.812 --> 18:23.356
were going to Dartmouth.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.147
- This is good.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.693
- I'll send you the website.

18:28.694 --> 18:30.819
From all over the world
right to your door,

18:30.820 --> 18:34.118
and the shipping fees are less
than what the taxes would be.

18:34.119 --> 18:37.324
What I will say is
next to no caregivers.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.748
All moms, but still.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.213
I thought by leaving Manhattan
I was through with it.

18:43.214 --> 18:46.750
This is worse because all
the conniving and ambition

18:46.751 --> 18:48.668
are less artfully concealed.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.229
- Don't lose sight
of how lucky you are.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.844
- Morning on the other side
of the world.

18:52.845 --> 18:53.885
That'll be husband.

18:53.886 --> 18:55.726
- I'll check on the girls.
- Thanks, Mere.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.637
Hello!

18:58.638 --> 18:59.971
- Angie?

18:59.972 --> 19:03.099
- Oh, you know,
just keeping it all moving.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.643
About to have dinner.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.645
Meredith came out.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.897
I know.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.815
How's China?

19:12.026 --> 19:14.028
Well, what do you want me
to ask you?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.614
I know.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.658
Allie's sick, but it'll pass.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.161
When are you coming back?

19:23.162 --> 19:26.414
No, no, everything's fine.
I'm just...

19:27.625 --> 19:30.085
You do want to
come home, though?

19:31.712 --> 19:32.879
Promise?

19:34.131 --> 19:35.590
No, I know.
Sure.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.386
Girls, it's your dad!

19:42.973 --> 19:45.067
May I call you once
I put them down?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.520
Okay, I-I'll try anyway.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.230
Here.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.608
- Hi, Daddy.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.608
- Immediately.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.276
- What time is it there?

19:55.277 --> 19:57.654
- Really?
- Mm.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.447
- Good.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.448
Yeah.

20:06.914 --> 20:07.914
- Come on.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.508
- Hello there.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.544
- I beg your pardon?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.388
- Can't a man
greet a woman in the street?

20:16.340 --> 20:17.716
- Is it Friday?

20:17.717 --> 20:20.385
- Just mixing things up.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.137
- You were going to call.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.061
Did you have lunch with Adam?

20:24.062 --> 20:25.348
What did he want?

20:25.349 --> 20:26.808
- To <i>catch</i> up.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.351
Where were you headed?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.103
- I'm craving chocolate.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.697
- Mind if I join?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.149
- You lecture today?

20:34.150 --> 20:37.777
Take on erotic striving.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.739
By my flee.
he was living with poodles.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.576
He said marriage was to reach
into a sack of snakes

20:44.577 --> 20:45.660
and find an eel.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.213
Mine is a life in which
the thinkers I admire

20:51.214 --> 20:54.002
contradict the reality
I inhabit.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.629
- Well, that's a relief.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.298
- I'm gonna retire.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.008
- What?

21:00.009 --> 21:01.676
- At the end of the year.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.146
My spring load is light,
then I'm done.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.144
- And you're telling me this
on a chance walk to the deli?

21:09.145 --> 21:10.769
- When else?

21:10.770 --> 21:11.737
- Why'?

21:11.738 --> 21:14.939
- I always said when I was done
I'd know it.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.816
I've been suspicious
for some time.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.160
- Suspicion is hardly-

21:18.161 --> 21:19.778
<i>- I'm certain.</i>

21:19.779 --> 21:20.996
- What are you gonna do?

21:20.997 --> 21:24.407
- Wake up and not have any idea.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.661
I've got a decade left,
maybe two.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.578
I want possibility.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.538
- It's all you've ever done.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.916
- And my life has been
incredibly fulfilling.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.251
I've been decent, honest, loyal.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.587
- I've worked hard.
- Yes.

21:37.588 --> 21:41.216
- I've also been perpetually
and resolutely safe.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.010
It's a threshold, Marcia.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.554
There for a moment, then gone.

21:46.555 --> 21:50.600
I've spent my life delving
into what it all means.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.560
I want to see for myself

21:52.561 --> 21:55.064
without the reassurance
of young adoration.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.989
- And will it be all right
if I still adore you?

21:58.990 --> 22:01.237
- More essential than ever.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.706
Let's get you chocolate.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.959
- I really think
we should give it an hour.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.076
A half hour even.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.122
- Not happening-

22:09.123 --> 22:10.620
- Just to put it in perspective.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.544
Particularly with the sort
of week it's been.

22:12.545 --> 22:13.832
- Hal!
- Ella!

22:13.833 --> 22:16.334
Get your asses down here!

22:16.335 --> 22:18.294
- If you're gonna
interrogate us like this,

22:18.295 --> 22:19.638
which based on the stories
you and Dad have told us

22:19.639 --> 22:21.047
will be patently hypocritical-

22:21.048 --> 22:22.048
- I swear to you, Hal,
if you don't cut

22:22.049 --> 22:24.175
the lawyerly bullshit,
I am gonna smack you so hard

22:24.176 --> 22:25.473
you're gonna
come to in New Jersey.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.766
- Jill.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.347
- Answer the question.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.890
Once a week?
More?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.600
Three times?
Every day?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.978
- Again, I'm sorry, I reject
the inquisitional tone.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.897
- Hal, if you ever
wanted to do me a favor

22:37.898 --> 22:38.898
just play ball here.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.067
- What the hell is going on?

22:41.068 --> 22:43.321
- You have been getting baked,
daily it would seem,

22:43.322 --> 22:45.116
in full view of our neighbors.

22:45.117 --> 22:46.453
- But why the rage and hysteria?

22:46.454 --> 22:48.792
- Why do you cry every day
for the last three weeks?

22:48.793 --> 22:49.868
- Ella, please.

22:49.869 --> 22:50.869
- Seriously,
you guys must have-

22:50.870 --> 22:53.496
- Oh, my God,
it's all crashing down.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.545
- Guys, answer the question.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.501
- Fine.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.044
At least daily.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.045
Even more than that.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.589
Whenever possible.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.304
- Where do you get it?
- Mm-mm.

23:04.305 --> 23:05.550
- You're telling us, Hal.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.598
- Not unless you want me
changing schools.

23:06.599 --> 23:07.886
- A kid in your class?

23:07.887 --> 23:09.307
- Yeah, would you rather
I buy it on the streets?

23:09.308 --> 23:10.557
Would that make you feel better?

23:10.558 --> 23:11.890
It's pot, Dad.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.939
Ultimately less potent
than the four glasses of wine

23:13.940 --> 23:15.310
you drink every night.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.731
And I'm first in my class
by miles,

23:16.732 --> 23:17.730
what the fuck difference
does it make?

23:17.731 --> 23:20.023
- Don't disrespect your father.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.072
- Did you seriously
just say "disrespect"?

23:22.073 --> 23:24.411
- What is going on here?

23:25.446 --> 23:26.868
Anyone?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.001
- Go ahead.

23:40.002 --> 23:43.963
- A tumor has been discovered
on one of your mother's ovaries.

23:43.964 --> 23:44.965
- Oh, shit.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.884
- She is having a procedure
this Friday

23:47.885 --> 23:49.512
thatll have her
in the hospital for the night

23:49.513 --> 23:51.888
and in bed
for a lot of the weekend,

23:51.889 --> 23:54.768
so I think you can understand
why the timing of this-

23:54.769 --> 23:57.894
- So, um, I'm sorry,
as in-as in malignant?

23:57.895 --> 23:59.020
- Jesus, Hal.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.397
- Possibly, yes.

24:01.398 --> 24:05.443
It's largely now just a question
of whether it's spread.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.861
- Look, guys.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.830
Whatever happens,
we're gonna deal.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.244
I know.

24:15.245 --> 24:19.040
- Just stop smoking pot
on the roof or anywhere.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.249
- We will.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.585
- You promise?

24:22.586 --> 24:23.587
- We promise.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.193
- You know this motherfucker
think I'm crazy, right?

24:39.561 --> 24:42.271
- Crazy is a tricky word, Joe.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.361
- You hear this shit?

24:43.362 --> 24:45.321
Been dealing with that
since grade school.

24:45.322 --> 24:48.036
Motherfucker twists every word
that come out your mouth.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.242
- Okay, Shani.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.160
- Ooh, fine-looking woman,
that Shani.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.161
- That's enough, Joe.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.332
- Fine habiliments too.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.455
- I said that's enough, Joe.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.005
- Oh, Shani don't mind
being told she fine.

25:02.006 --> 25:04.836
Got them kind of legs
that don't stop.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.305
- Good-bye, Dr. Barnes.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.803
- Which one of you is Jeffrey?
- I am.

25:10.804 --> 25:12.015
- I told you explicitly-

25:12.016 --> 25:13.136
- I know, I know.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.558
First of all, I would like you
to meet Cedar Lemons,

25:15.559 --> 25:17.181
and we truly appreciate you
seeing us

25:17.182 --> 25:19.025
after what I know must have been
an arduous day.

25:19.026 --> 25:20.770
- You lay that shit on, Jeffrey.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.395
- That woman was a patient.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.773
I'm running a practice here.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.023
- We're truly sorry-

25:25.024 --> 25:26.069
- And there's no point
to any of this

25:26.070 --> 25:27.067
unless Joe is on board.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.609
- Joe is on board.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.610
- I need to hear that from Joe.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.279
- On board, Doctor.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.947
- I heard that before.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.576
- I just got to
make things right.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.244
Get my equilibrium.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.245
- Not in here, Joe.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.840
- Oh, come on, Doctor.
- Joe, listen to me.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.332
Not in here.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.381
There's a bathroom
down the hall.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.388
Where you going, bitch?

25:52.389 --> 25:55.303
- Wherever you go.
- Like white on rice.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.180
And you don't disrespect me

25:57.181 --> 25:58.808
or Jeffrey or the doctor here
no more.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.150
Shit's done.
You got that?

26:00.151 --> 26:02.019
- Got it.

26:05.314 --> 26:08.154
- So he wants to shoot up
and you allow that?

26:08.155 --> 26:10.118
- I run a psychiatric office,
not a precinct.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.779
How do you know Joe?

26:12.780 --> 26:14.157
- We grew up together.

26:14.158 --> 26:15.281
- You paying for the muscle?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.365
- His father.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.366
- I met him.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.619
Difficult man,
but obviously smart.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.162
- Joe's smarter.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.756
- Be tough to argue that
right at this moment.

26:22.757 --> 26:24.216
- You don't seem
to like Joe much.

26:24.217 --> 26:25.541
- I love Joe.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.294
I spent four years confronting
the tragedy that is Joe.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.295
Smart?

26:29.296 --> 26:31.422
Imagine what he could have been.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.221
We get him across the street,
I can keep him in

26:33.222 --> 26:35.889
until he signs himself out,
which he will do.

26:35.890 --> 26:37.354
You gonna be there
to pick him up?

26:37.355 --> 26:39.599
- I'm leaving for Delaware.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.985
- He'll be out of his mind
with no money.

26:46.986 --> 26:48.815
He has a history of theft.

26:48.816 --> 26:49.816
- I know.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.114
- And violence.

26:52.277 --> 26:55.076
I'm not gonna follow him around
and clearly you're not either.

26:55.077 --> 26:56.995
- I need to do this.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.834
- Not just across the street.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.202
Inside.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.297
Where he signs his name.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.630
- Just a second.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.848
Just a second.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.344
- Joe.
- No, fuck you, man.

27:16.345 --> 27:18.970
I'm just making sure
I got everything I need.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.518
- My wife and my children
are expecting me at home.

27:21.519 --> 27:22.892
- I ain't stopping you.

27:22.893 --> 27:24.267
Familial bliss.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.185
I get that shit.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.779
- I'm going inside.

27:30.732 --> 27:31.779
- See how that motherfucker
treat me?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.276
- Treating you straight.

27:33.277 --> 27:34.322
- What you know?

27:34.323 --> 27:35.486
- I got to be a expert?

27:35.487 --> 27:37.706
- You got to know something
you want to tell me what's what.

27:37.707 --> 27:39.118
- Guy got me clean was my uncle.

27:39.119 --> 27:41.331
Never touched a needle
in his life.

27:41.332 --> 27:43.452
- Saying you used?
- You hear what you want.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.875
- Uh-uh, Joe,
not here in the street.

27:44.876 --> 27:46.124
- Got to put that away.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.832
- One POP-

27:47.833 --> 27:49.335
Last one of my life.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.255
- Son of a bitch!
- That's right, you stay away-.

27:52.256 --> 27:53.299
- Give me the rig.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.714
- I ain't going to that hospital

27:54.715 --> 27:56.010
till you get
your ass out of here.

27:56.011 --> 27:57.009
You hear me?

27:57.010 --> 27:59.512
I ain't going no place
till this motherfucker

27:59.513 --> 28:01.684
extricate
his hormone monster ass

28:01.685 --> 28:03.181
from the situation!

28:03.182 --> 28:04.432
- Fine.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.355
- Wait, what?

28:05.356 --> 28:07.273
- You paid me to get him
to the doctor.

28:07.274 --> 28:08.394
- He paid you?

28:08.395 --> 28:10.021
Remune-fucking-ration?

28:10.022 --> 28:13.492
- Think I done this on
charity work, you junkie ass?

28:13.493 --> 28:16.327
Nice meeting you, Jeffrey.
Good luck.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.827
Now it's just you and me, huh?

28:24.828 --> 28:27.455
Like the old days
down in the basement.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.629
- You need
to put that away, man.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.509
- Just give me two minutes.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.256
Two minutes.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.218
- What's going on now, Joe?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.553
- Just thinking a little.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.646
Maybe I'll go home.

28:43.647 --> 28:46.140
You know, get truly ready.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.725
Sort this shit out.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.024
Then we meet here tomorrow
first thing.

28:50.025 --> 28:51.145
<i>Tabula rasa.</i>

28:51.146 --> 28:53.192
- Maybe we should go
inside as planned.

28:53.193 --> 28:55.909
Otherwise you're a danger
to yourself and others out here.

28:55.910 --> 28:57.903
Wouldn't you say so, Jeffrey?

28:59.112 --> 29:00.659
- I would.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.993
- No!
- No!

29:05.994 --> 29:07.119
What's going on?

29:07.120 --> 29:10.331
No! No!
No!

29:10.332 --> 29:11.916
No!
Let me go!

29:11.917 --> 29:13.626
Let me go!

29:13.627 --> 29:15.253
Jeffrey!
No!

29:15.254 --> 29:16.254
No!

29:16.255 --> 29:18.599
I tell you
it's against my consent!

29:18.600 --> 29:21.008
It's against my consent!
Jeffrey!

29:21.009 --> 29:22.343
Jeffrey, please!

29:22.344 --> 29:23.886
Don't do this to me!

29:23.887 --> 29:24.887
Jeffrey, don't!

29:24.888 --> 29:26.347
Motherfucker, no!

29:26.348 --> 29:28.099
It's against my will!

29:28.100 --> 29:29.350
Jeffrey!

29:29.351 --> 29:30.518
Oh, God!

29:30.519 --> 29:33.479
No!
No, Jeffrey!

29:33.480 --> 29:34.563
Jeffrey!

29:34.564 --> 29:35.898
Don't, please!

29:35.899 --> 29:37.525
Please!

29:37.526 --> 29:38.734
No!

29:38.735 --> 29:40.403
Please, Jeffrey, please!

29:40.404 --> 29:42.113
Please, Jeffrey, please!

29:42.114 --> 29:43.281
Don't do it!

29:43.282 --> 29:46.033
Don't!
Please, don't!

29:46.034 --> 29:47.910
Jeffrey, don't do-

29:47.911 --> 29:49.328
don't do it!

29:49.329 --> 29:50.329
Please!

29:50.330 --> 29:52.832
No!
No!

29:52.833 --> 29:54.417
No!

29:54.418 --> 29:56.043
No!

30:01.425 --> 30:04.645
<i>- She trusted, right?</i>

30:05.637 --> 30:07.981
<i>And her trust got broken.</i>

30:08.974 --> 30:10.521
- The loss of innocence?

30:10.522 --> 30:12.184
- Where'd you get that?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.978
- Ms. Geller.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.105
- So you're paying attention.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.824
- What's that supposed to mean?

30:17.825 --> 30:19.900
- Go ahead.
- Type it in.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.444
- She's asleep.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.740
- How many chapters
did you read?

30:22.741 --> 30:23.739
- Three.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.574
- She's gonna want you
here every night.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.284
Say good night
to your Aunt Meredith.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.285
- She's not my aunt.

30:29.286 --> 30:30.703
- It's an expression.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.955
See you soon, Allie.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.173
- Night, Mere.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.507
- Have that done
when I get back.

30:37.508 --> 30:40.087
No texting or IMing or emailing

30:40.088 --> 30:43.058
or any other kind
of pseudo-communication.

30:45.427 --> 30:46.519
- This was amazing.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.762
They're amazing.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.140
You made the right choice.

30:49.141 --> 30:51.474
- You think?
- Well, why did you?

30:51.475 --> 30:53.517
- The city had made me numb.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.688
- Yeah, I get that.

30:54.689 --> 30:55.858
- Don't patronize.

30:55.859 --> 30:57.313
- That's harsh.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.653
- You'd switch places?

30:58.654 --> 31:00.237
- Conceptually in a second.

31:00.238 --> 31:03.077
Especially after 2008,
so let's not go there.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.657
- I don't believe
my husband is in China.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.955
- What?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.043
- When he called, I heard
a siren in the background.

31:16.044 --> 31:17.509
It was definitely American.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.502
- Sarah.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.925
- You forget I spent
a year and a half

31:20.926 --> 31:22.385
in Beijing after B-school.

31:22.386 --> 31:23.551
I know of what I speak.

31:23.552 --> 31:24.845
- Did you say anything?

31:24.846 --> 31:27.009
- 'Where are you and with whom?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.387
"Why do you spend
so much time away?"

31:29.388 --> 31:31.222
No.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.765
<i>- Just because-</i>

31:32.766 --> 31:33.808
you don't know.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.644
No, you're right.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.896
I shouldn't have said anything.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.440
- Because why would he?

31:41.441 --> 31:42.566
- You're right.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.320
- I can stay.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.664
- Europe will be humming
at 5:00 a.m.

31:47.665 --> 31:49.158
I know the drill.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.169
- I love you.
- I love you.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.337
- Ray is a prick and a narc.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.469
You're gonna tell me that
superannuated hippie

32:42.470 --> 32:44.462
didn't smoke in his day?

32:44.463 --> 32:45.806
That he still doesn't?

32:56.349 --> 32:57.933
You know, Mom's right.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.436
We're, uh...

33:00.437 --> 33:01.937
We're gonna deal.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.481
I promise.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.131
- So what did you say?

33:24.169 --> 33:26.378
- Does it matter?

33:26.379 --> 33:28.757
- Maybe I want to know
how you lie.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.343
- Wow.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.385
- The usual?

33:33.386 --> 33:34.729
- Thanks.
- And you?

33:34.730 --> 33:38.942
- Uh, coffee and lox platter,
everything bagel.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.938
- Why "wow"?

33:43.939 --> 33:47.068
- It's-it was just a strong
statement, that's all.

33:47.069 --> 33:49.902
- What do you want from me, Sam?

33:49.903 --> 33:51.530
- This.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.989
Right now.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.324
- Like your bagel.

33:55.325 --> 33:56.617
- My bagel?

33:56.618 --> 33:58.040
- Everything.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.833
- Is there coffee?

34:04.834 --> 34:06.544
- Oh, I thought you left.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.842
- I pushed my first meeting
half an hour.

34:08.844 --> 34:11.715
Not sure the girl
will show anyway.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.842
- Who is she?

34:13.842 --> 34:16.266
- Graduate student
I was telling you about.

34:16.266 --> 34:18.222
Brilliant but troubled.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.348
- How?

34:19.349 --> 34:20.851
- Not sure.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.228
Inscrutable.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.899
- Eat out tonight?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.735
- I'm hosting
the seminar dinner.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.362
- I hate the thought of you
walking home so late.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.447
- I'll be quiet coming in.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.373
- I might be up.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.918
- Yeah?

35:09.899 --> 35:12.151
- <i>The first time
I came to New York,</i>

35:12.152 --> 35:15.372
this is where my mum took us
before anywhere else.

35:15.373 --> 35:17.948
I was so pissed.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.542
- Why?
- Where did you want to go?

35:19.543 --> 35:21.201
- Shops, noise,

35:21.202 --> 35:24.079
the huge buildings,

35:24.080 --> 35:25.205
theaters, streets.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.416
Wha-whatever.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.417
- That doesn't sound like you.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.796
- Yeah, but then when
we got there, I was like,

35:30.797 --> 35:33.264
"Oh, <i>I</i> get it."

35:34.257 --> 35:35.802
- You'll have to tell her
you went.

35:35.803 --> 35:37.801
- "Oh, that's so sweet, darling.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.016
Who'd you go with?"

35:39.017 --> 35:41.140
- You don't have to tell her
with whom.

35:41.141 --> 35:43.813
- She says I'm having the life
she never had the guts to.

35:43.814 --> 35:45.225
- A career.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.352
- Oh, bigger than that.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.697
Like, she's never
had a place of her own.

35:48.698 --> 35:50.564
Imagine that.

35:50.565 --> 35:54.485
From her parents to college
and then in with Dad.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.081
And of course, I have yet to
live the only life she's known.

35:58.082 --> 36:00.366
- Well, would you want that?

36:00.367 --> 36:02.660
- I-I'm as.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.789
- Friends of mine are having
their kids in their 40s.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.631
- And they'll be in
their 60s when their kids

36:06.632 --> 36:07.748
graduate college.

36:07.749 --> 36:08.921
Not for me.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.794
You need to know that.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.545
- You've made that clear.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.546
- It doesn't seem like it.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.049
- Okay.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.018
We have four days together.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.138
Three and a half.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.432
We agreed that we-
and now twice this morning.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.434
- I'm sorry.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.435
- I'll do right by us.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.360
I just don't know
what that means.

36:34.361 --> 36:36.902
- Can't that be good?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.987
<i>Not knowing?</i>

36:54.629 --> 36:56.552
- It just seems so irrelevant.

36:58.258 --> 37:01.055
Arguing interpretations
with the other 12 people

37:01.056 --> 37:02.803
that have read
the same text as you.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.180
- Millions would be
more accurate.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.890
- Not these days.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.562
- Something must've kept
you interested

37:08.563 --> 37:10.312
through a master's program.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.275
<i>You become accustomed.</i>

37:16.276 --> 37:18.694
- To abject despair?

37:18.695 --> 37:22.074
- To choosing a life that
relates directly to very few,

37:22.075 --> 37:24.241
but quite directly to everyone.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.118
- What if you're fooling
yourself?

37:26.119 --> 37:28.838
- That very question is what
it's all about.

37:28.839 --> 37:30.247
- Fooling ourselves?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.463
- At the heart
of human interaction

37:32.464 --> 37:35.838
is the agreement that
we're all going to fabricate.

37:35.839 --> 37:39.135
Which is to say, agree on
certain precepts we call truths,

37:39.136 --> 37:42.887
but would be utter nonsense
to anyone not in on the game.

37:42.888 --> 37:44.887
Consider language.

37:44.888 --> 37:48.307
We call an elephant an elephant

37:48.308 --> 37:51.903
with a certainty that will
go so far as to marginalize,

37:51.904 --> 37:54.646
even ostracize
those who will refuse.

37:54.647 --> 37:58.734
Society depends zealously
on this, so we can structure it.

37:58.735 --> 38:02.362
In this case,
communicate with one another

38:02.363 --> 38:05.032
even as each of us
has his or her own

38:05.033 --> 38:08.368
disposition toward elephants.

38:08.369 --> 38:11.248
Why should philosophy
in any form be different?

38:11.249 --> 38:13.212
- Because ultimately
who really cares?

38:13.213 --> 38:16.255
- Everyone, regardless
of how few want to try

38:16.256 --> 38:19.802
to understand it, which is why
I've spent my life gorgeously

38:19.803 --> 38:21.220
and so can you.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.084
- Why have you done this
to yourself, Sophie?

38:52.085 --> 38:54.833
- To know that I'm here.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.386
- May I ask how?

39:00.588 --> 39:02.340
- Curling iron mostly.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.681
- If to be wounded
is to exist...

39:10.765 --> 39:13.769
You're giving yourself
a pretty narrow endgame.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.148
- Have you sought counseling?

39:20.149 --> 39:22.192
Been to health services?

39:22.193 --> 39:24.912
- There is a woman that
I've started to see, yeah.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.116
- Is she aware of this?

39:30.451 --> 39:32.920
You have to tell her.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.420
- Will you come with me?

39:48.469 --> 39:51.266
- No, Mr. Cohen already
makes me paranoid enough.

39:51.267 --> 39:53.060
- But that's two hours from now,

39:53.061 --> 39:54.396
and besides, he's harmless.

39:54.397 --> 39:56.732
All you have to do
is use the word "dichotomy"

39:56.733 --> 39:58.192
and he'll eat out of your hand.

39:58.193 --> 40:00.610
- I still don't know
what that word means.

40:00.611 --> 40:02.733
- He actually misuses it.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.907
Specifically it's the rhetorical
contrasting of two opposing

40:04.908 --> 40:07.493
or divergent ideas,
thus the prefix dicho-, two,

40:07.494 --> 40:09.489
and then -tomy, meaning to cut.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.083
- Make out with me.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.298
Hal?

40:26.299 --> 40:27.767
- Yeah?

40:29.844 --> 40:32.220
- I think I'm ready.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.350
This weekend my parents
will be away.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.811
- Is it 'cause
my mom has cancer?

40:39.812 --> 40:41.813
- No, asshole.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.238
It's because I want to.

40:45.239 --> 40:47.277
- So it's not a sympathy thing?

40:48.279 --> 40:49.743
You ask me that one more time,

40:49.744 --> 40:52.993
we're breaking up and you can
keep fucking your hand.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.827
- Wow.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.123
Friday might be tricky,

40:57.124 --> 40:59.590
but I can just tell my parents
I'm staying at Greg's.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.922
- <i>I could spend a year
like this.</i>

41:06.923 --> 41:08.095
<i>Every day.</i>

41:10.385 --> 41:12.137
How do you fit it
all into a life?

41:12.138 --> 41:15.231
- You leave the world
with things still to do.

41:15.232 --> 41:16.306
- That's tragic.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.517
- Tragic is becoming satisfied.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.567
Why didn't I meet you
20 years ago?

41:21.568 --> 41:24.106
- Mm, the Atlantic Ocean.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.825
Child abuse.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.286
- Where's that one from?

41:28.287 --> 41:29.904
- Malaysia.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.240
- This shape is incredible.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.700
- Mm.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.869
The lower and upper sepals
are for protection.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.080
This petal is the labellum.

41:40.081 --> 41:41.545
It's always the largest.

41:41.546 --> 41:45.132
It lies flat like that to make
it comfortable for pollinators.

41:45.133 --> 41:48.588
All that beauty is-is just
about making more of them.

41:48.589 --> 41:49.590
- Right.

41:50.591 --> 41:51.925
- Sam?

41:51.926 --> 41:54.179
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What is it?

41:54.180 --> 41:55.805
- That's my daughter's teacher.

41:56.806 --> 41:59.683
- Teddy, I'll take your picture.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.402
- And that's my daughter.

42:02.603 --> 42:03.820
Come on.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.587
- He just stays
in his little bubble.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.434
- Sophie?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.638
- Two months.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.474
- What made you start?

42:40.475 --> 42:41.683
- An accident.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.852
- With the iron?

42:43.853 --> 42:45.604
- Cigarette.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.189
- Was it an accident?

42:47.190 --> 42:48.440
- I guess not.

42:48.441 --> 42:49.818
- Go on.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.080
- I-it...

42:55.198 --> 42:56.825
It concentrated me...

42:58.409 --> 43:01.959
To the exclusion
of everything else.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.874
- And that was good?

43:05.875 --> 43:08.085
- It was like a drug.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.713
- What's everything else?

43:15.259 --> 43:17.478
The world has just become...

43:19.263 --> 43:21.857
So inhuman.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.520
Everyone's plugged in.

43:26.521 --> 43:29.981
Blindingly inarticulate.

43:29.982 --> 43:32.609
Obsessed with money,
their careers.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.534
Stupidly, arrogantly content.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.124
I can't talk to them.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.909
I fight them.

43:40.910 --> 43:43.870
I want to destroy them, even.

43:43.871 --> 43:45.831
<i>I crave interaction.</i>

43:45.832 --> 43:47.300
I crave it.

43:48.501 --> 43:51.461
But you just can't anymore.

43:51.462 --> 43:54.591
They pull their devices out
for every little thing:

43:54.592 --> 43:56.886
to reinforce their petty,
convenient notions,

43:56.887 --> 43:58.555
to decide where
they're going to shop,

43:58.556 --> 44:01.306
what they're gonna eat,
what movies they're gonna watch,

44:01.307 --> 44:02.556
everything they ingest.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.355
- Why does that upset you?

44:05.643 --> 44:06.643
- Because what is left?

44:06.644 --> 44:08.061
My God.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.360
- But that doesn't
have to be you.

44:10.361 --> 44:11.439
- Okay.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.944
It's like this is all a game

44:15.945 --> 44:18.664
and I haven't been told
what the rules are.

44:18.665 --> 44:21.366
Or even worse, if I had,

44:21.367 --> 44:23.085
I am ill-equipped
to follow them.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.872
All I can do is provoke.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.915
I become spiteful.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.258
I'm just as bad as they are.

44:32.259 --> 44:34.921
They?
I'm-I'm worse.

44:34.922 --> 44:38.800
I fucking hate myself for it

44:40.595 --> 44:44.598
I'm-I am so fucking lonely.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.603
Why is the world so base?

44:49.604 --> 44:50.981
Why is it so insensitive?

44:50.982 --> 44:52.564
Why is it so selfish?

44:52.565 --> 44:53.732
Why am I?

44:58.654 --> 45:01.948
I am not for this world.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.786
- Fucking shit.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.998
- You've been asleep
a long time.

45:09.999 --> 45:11.208
- How long?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.303
- From when they say
you come in last night?

45:13.304 --> 45:14.762
14 hour.

45:19.008 --> 45:20.175
- Seriously?

45:20.176 --> 45:22.427
- It ain't up to me.

45:22.428 --> 45:24.226
- But you could undo them,
couldn't you?

45:24.227 --> 45:25.722
Extricate my ass?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.766
- And lose my job?

45:27.767 --> 45:28.892
- Where you going?

45:28.893 --> 45:30.060
- Other patient.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.404
- I'm just hungry
like a motherfucker.

45:31.405 --> 45:34.564
- We're gonna get you food,
bring you water.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.283
- You got some crack
I can smoke?

45:36.284 --> 45:37.692
- Afraid not.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.778
- You know, just a little bit.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.531
Fire that shit up.

45:43.074 --> 45:46.117
Motherfucker!

45:46.118 --> 45:48.703
Motherfucker!

45:48.704 --> 45:50.126
Fuck you!

45:51.082 --> 45:52.415
Fuck you!

45:52.416 --> 45:53.833
Fuck you!

45:53.834 --> 45:55.802
Fuck you!
Fuck it!

45:58.256 --> 46:00.554
<i>- We were just out of school.</i>

46:02.510 --> 46:04.719
Living uptown.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.596
We both had really lucrative
job offers.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.391
She was gonna
maybe go to London.

46:09.392 --> 46:12.612
Chose the Far East
instead to be with me.

46:14.021 --> 46:17.571
The next logical step
was marriage and kids.

46:19.527 --> 46:24.158
And we just did that, kind of
without even discussing it.

46:25.408 --> 46:28.660
Two hyper-educated young adults

46:28.661 --> 46:30.500
making the most significant
decision in life

46:30.501 --> 46:32.874
without a single
real conversation.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.878
We talked about movies we saw

46:36.879 --> 46:39.676
more than the meaning
of a future together.

46:42.883 --> 46:45.557
I remember being, um...

46:47.221 --> 46:48.973
What would the word be?

46:50.891 --> 46:54.612
Frozen when she was pregnant
the first time.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.899
I thought,

46:59.900 --> 47:01.402
"Oh.

47:02.445 --> 47:05.574
You know,
something's definitely over."

47:06.574 --> 47:09.242
And I never stopped to enjoy it.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.291
- But you like having kids.

47:12.705 --> 47:15.208
- I love having kids.

47:18.044 --> 47:21.389
I get home, you know,
usually too late for dinner.

47:22.423 --> 47:23.424
<i>She's...</i>

47:24.717 --> 47:27.093
Into her third drink,

47:27.094 --> 47:29.768
and I have about an hour before
the girls have to go to bed,

47:29.769 --> 47:31.348
and I-

47:31.349 --> 47:34.899
I go into their room with
a plate, and I-l don't leave.

47:39.231 --> 47:40.778
Most of our interactions
these days

47:40.779 --> 47:45.737
consist of algebra and whatever

47:45.738 --> 47:48.034
self-consciously
multi-cultural book

47:48.035 --> 47:49.579
they're reading at the time.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.710
As they get older, they get...

47:56.582 --> 47:57.629
Quieter.

48:00.002 --> 48:03.088
The older one, Allie, she's-
she's getting belligerent.

48:03.089 --> 48:04.090
- Mm.

48:05.424 --> 48:07.802
Your wife drinks
'cause you're not really there.

48:14.183 --> 48:16.231
- Yeah, that's obviously
part of that.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.326
- Not exactly the raucous time
we were thinking of, huh?

48:27.988 --> 48:29.906
- It's honest.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.241
- That's ironic.

48:31.242 --> 48:32.243
- Mm.

48:40.543 --> 48:42.216
- I don't want to go home yet.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.677
- You have to, Sam.

48:53.973 --> 48:56.349
- Just one more day.

48:56.350 --> 48:58.193
She's not expecting me yet.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.367
- One more day.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.743
- Are there friends
you can speak to?

49:13.744 --> 49:14.909
Your father?

49:14.910 --> 49:17.328
Your brother.
Hal, isn't it?

49:17.329 --> 49:19.876
- What is this with me
needing to talk to anyone?

49:19.877 --> 49:22.423
- Just to know others are
concerned, care about you.

49:22.424 --> 49:24.586
- You believe that?

49:24.587 --> 49:27.130
That people
care about each other'?

49:27.131 --> 49:29.509
- We treat people the way
we want to be treated.

49:29.510 --> 49:31.134
It's just compassion.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.604
- I don't consider myself
compassionate.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.019
I have no respect for my father

49:36.020 --> 49:39.225
because he is bossed around
by my mother.

49:39.226 --> 49:42.270
Now, I not only hate her,

49:42.271 --> 49:45.857
but I resent her

49:45.858 --> 49:49.319
because it's interfering
with my life.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.362
- All this is natural.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.490
- It's-

49:53.491 --> 49:55.909
Pretty fucked up too.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.494
- You're young.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.791
You don't want your life
interrupted.

49:59.792 --> 50:01.790
- I love her so much.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.837
- Hello, Joe.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.006
- Fucking let me out of here.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.929
- In about 20 hours, you'll
be able to sign yourself out.

50:12.930 --> 50:14.804
- So let's skip
the fucking hassle.

50:14.805 --> 50:18.598
- By law, I've got to hold you
for 48 hours.

50:18.599 --> 50:21.351
- Hold a man that wasn't
hurting nobody.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.770
Come to his apartment uninvited,

50:23.771 --> 50:26.149
chuck him in a hospital,
strap him down.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.659
- If you could kill yourself
right now, would you?

50:33.656 --> 50:35.490
Ain't gonna kill myself.

50:35.491 --> 50:36.868
- You'll be dead in a year.

50:36.869 --> 50:38.456
- You told me that last year.

50:38.457 --> 50:40.248
- Last year
I gave you two years.

50:40.249 --> 50:41.666
We're right on schedule.

50:41.667 --> 50:43.665
- Tell that nurse
to bring me my dinner.

50:43.666 --> 50:44.666
- Not until I-

50:44.667 --> 50:46.635
- I don't think you understand.

50:46.636 --> 50:49.847
You are not here anymore.

50:57.304 --> 50:59.227
<i>- That what you're expecting,
Mr. Clancy?</i>

50:59.228 --> 51:01.266
- It's opening up.

51:01.267 --> 51:02.735
- You want to try
something else?

51:02.736 --> 51:04.185
- I'm good, thanks.

51:04.186 --> 51:05.478
- Hello, Jeffrey.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.855
- You too?

51:07.856 --> 51:08.856
Where's Devlin?

51:08.857 --> 51:10.358
- He's here.
- The full team.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.484
- Care to join me?

51:11.485 --> 51:13.194
- Think we can be nice
to each other?

51:13.195 --> 51:14.196
- I'm optimistic.

51:15.864 --> 51:17.282
- Excuse me.

51:17.283 --> 51:18.866
- His name's Jerry.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.994
- First name basis.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.329
- Hey, Jerry, this is Rachel.
- Yeah.

51:23.330 --> 51:24.581
- I'm arguing against her
in the morning.

51:24.582 --> 51:26.124
Make sure she's hungover.

51:27.126 --> 51:29.754
I'll just have a glass
of that and see a menu.

51:29.755 --> 51:30.754
- Sure thing.

51:30.755 --> 51:32.347
Shit.

51:33.757 --> 51:35.967
I have to make a phone call.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.427
It'll be a second.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.652
- Yeah, who this?

51:54.653 --> 51:56.404
- Hey, buddy, how you faring?

51:56.405 --> 51:57.405
- How am I faring?

51:57.406 --> 51:59.407
What am I,
on a motherfucking yacht?

51:59.408 --> 52:00.742
- How are you, Joe?

52:00.743 --> 52:02.290
<i>- You fucking left town.</i>

52:02.291 --> 52:04.287
- I had no choice.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.039
- <i>You always got</i> a <i>choice.</i>

52:06.040 --> 52:08.255
Even I know that,
and I'm a motherfucking junkie.

52:08.256 --> 52:11.047
<i>- A case I've been working on
for eight months.</i>

52:11.048 --> 52:13.173
- So that's more important
than your friend

52:13.174 --> 52:14.843
that you just dumped in a detox?

52:14.844 --> 52:17.430
- To a company with
$700 million at stake, it is.

52:17.431 --> 52:19.052
<i>- Oh, so that's supposed to</i>

52:19.053 --> 52:20.517
belittle me, make me feel small.

52:20.518 --> 52:22.513
What, you working for
Warren fucking Buffett?

52:22.514 --> 52:24.641
<i>Maybe you could've
picked another day</i>

52:24.642 --> 52:26.100
<i>to fucking commit me.</i>

52:26.101 --> 52:28.269
- Hasn't your dad been down?

52:28.270 --> 52:30.521
<i>- When I was asleep.</i>

52:30.522 --> 52:32.318
- Well, he'll be back.
- For what?

52:32.319 --> 52:35.026
- <i>Says he kept you afloat
for the past five years.</i>

52:35.027 --> 52:36.447
- And pay for four years
at Amherst.

52:36.448 --> 52:37.688
You think I haven't heard that?

52:38.447 --> 52:40.118
<i>When you coming back?</i>

52:40.119 --> 52:42.288
- Depends on how long
the case lasts.

52:42.289 --> 52:46.120
- Say, man, how much, uh,
you make a year?

52:46.121 --> 52:49.462
<i>I mad in the newspapers
you motherfuckers can pull in</i>

52:49.463 --> 52:51.836
<i>$2 million plus if you're
a partner at a big firm.</i>

52:51.837 --> 52:54.253
- We are not discussing that.

52:54.254 --> 52:55.722
- Okay,
so what we gonna discuss?

52:55.723 --> 52:57.924
'Cause you called my ass.

52:57.925 --> 52:59.300
- I have to go, Joe.

52:59.301 --> 53:00.473
- Why you hanging up so fast?

53:01.470 --> 53:02.470
- I'm in a meeting.

53:02.471 --> 53:04.097
<i>- Don't go, man.</i>

53:06.350 --> 53:07.897
- I'll call you later.

53:10.229 --> 53:12.397
Don't forget:

53:12.398 --> 53:14.607
<i>you all I got.</i>

53:14.608 --> 53:16.484
- I'll set my alarm to it

53:16.485 --> 53:18.361
- I'll be waiting up.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.154
<i>- Hey-hey, Joe?</i>

53:20.155 --> 53:21.156
- Yeah?

53:22.157 --> 53:23.500
- I love you, man.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.332
- I got to go-.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.888
- So what was Ginsberg like?

53:45.889 --> 53:48.850
- Fantastic.
- Really.

53:48.851 --> 53:51.185
- And no way was I gonna teach.

53:51.186 --> 53:52.437
Corporate all the way.

53:52.438 --> 53:54.105
Litigation all the way.

53:54.106 --> 53:55.323
Never anything else.

53:55.324 --> 53:57.942
When I decided to sell.

54:05.951 --> 54:08.202
- Fucking call me.

54:11.206 --> 54:13.583
Fucking call me!

54:47.785 --> 54:50.536
Why didn't you wake me?

54:50.537 --> 54:51.959
- You should get the kids up.

54:53.373 --> 54:54.966
- All right.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.088
Hal, it's 6:45.

55:01.089 --> 55:02.089
- Thanks, Dad.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.216
- Few minutes.
- No.

55:03.217 --> 55:04.434
Don't fuck with me this morning.

55:04.435 --> 55:08.137
You know what's happening today.
I don't have the time or energy.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.498
- I'm gonna stay
at Greg's tonight.

55:10.098 --> 55:12.016
- Pardon?

55:12.017 --> 55:13.893
- Greg's.
- He needs, uh-

55:13.894 --> 55:16.562
- Are you aware that
your mother is having surgery?

55:16.563 --> 55:18.281
- Yes, I thought you wanted me
out of the house.

55:18.282 --> 55:21.067
- No, you want to go
to Greg's and get stoned

55:21.068 --> 55:22.613
'cause it's harder
to do that here now.

55:22.614 --> 55:23.612
- That's actually not the case.

55:23.613 --> 55:26.155
- We're gonna be together
this weekend as a family.

55:26.156 --> 55:28.032
That means while your mom
and I are at the hospital,

55:28.033 --> 55:29.617
you're home with Ella.

55:29.618 --> 55:31.082
- Okay.
- That's all you had to say.

55:31.083 --> 55:32.546
- I just wish I hadn't.

55:36.875 --> 55:39.924
- The best thing you can do for
me is to ace that history test.

55:39.925 --> 55:41.420
- I got it postponed.

55:41.421 --> 55:42.466
- Ella, don't do that.

55:42.467 --> 55:44.592
You could take it
with your eyes closed.

55:44.593 --> 55:46.011
- Well, I'm not going to.

55:46.012 --> 55:48.386
- What are you gonna do
during that period?

55:48.387 --> 55:49.679
- Talk with Mr. Werth.

55:49.680 --> 55:51.307
- Can't you talk with him
during a free?

55:51.308 --> 55:53.140
- I don't want to.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.109
Why do you care?
I'll take it next week.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.104
- I need to feel like
your life is going on.

55:58.105 --> 55:59.480
That it will go on.

55:59.481 --> 56:01.277
- I'd want it to stop for me.

56:01.278 --> 56:02.777
- You won't when you're a mom.

56:02.778 --> 56:03.985
- Yes, I will.

56:03.986 --> 56:06.153
- Just take the fucking test.

56:06.154 --> 56:08.657
- Honey, we should go.

56:14.746 --> 56:17.712
- Why do we all have to play
stringed instruments?

56:17.713 --> 56:19.460
- It's good for your brain.

56:19.461 --> 56:21.881
- So is math and science.
- So is reading.

56:21.882 --> 56:25.089
- Presumably you're being
taught those subjects as well.

56:25.090 --> 56:27.011
- They could teach them more
and ditch the hours of violin

56:27.012 --> 56:28.010
every week.

56:28.011 --> 56:30.433
- Besides, she doesn't
let us play any notes.

56:30.434 --> 56:31.596
- What do you do?

56:31.597 --> 56:33.474
- Spend the first three months
learning how to hold

56:33.475 --> 56:34.599
the stupid instrument.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.850
- You're joking.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.768
- It's totally fucking lame.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.020
- Watch your language.

56:39.021 --> 56:41.115
And Mrs. Silver
is nationally renowned.

56:41.116 --> 56:42.690
- As what?

56:42.691 --> 56:44.358
- As a violin teacher.

56:44.359 --> 56:47.111
And your school happens to have
the top strings program

56:47.112 --> 56:48.154
in the country.

56:48.155 --> 56:50.451
You know, families move to
Englewood just to go there.

56:50.452 --> 56:52.247
- Is that why we moved
to Englewood?

56:52.248 --> 56:53.326
- No.

56:53.327 --> 56:56.829
I mean, I did check out
the school, but-

56:56.830 --> 56:59.540
Don't you like New Jersey?

56:59.541 --> 57:00.750
- I hate New Jersey.

57:00.751 --> 57:01.627
- I love it.

57:01.628 --> 57:03.377
- You're a moron.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.046
- I wanted change.

57:05.047 --> 57:06.264
- So Dad could be gone
half the time

57:06.265 --> 57:08.179
and you could get drunk
every night?

57:08.180 --> 57:10.051
- Holy shit.

57:10.052 --> 57:11.679
Angie, get out of the car.

57:11.680 --> 57:14.555
- Why?
- Just get out of the car.

57:14.556 --> 57:15.808
Go to strings.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.863
Don't you ever
talk to me like that again,

57:24.864 --> 57:27.405
especially in front
of your little sister.

57:27.406 --> 57:30.242
You might be a fucked-up
little monster, but she isn't.

57:30.243 --> 57:31.489
- Well, like you say, Mom,

57:31.490 --> 57:34.243
smart people, girls especially,
are all fucked up.

57:36.662 --> 57:38.996
- You think
I'm drinking too much?

57:38.997 --> 57:41.375
It's just wine mostly.

57:42.876 --> 57:45.086
- I think you're not happy.

57:45.087 --> 57:46.930
Not happy in the city working.

57:46.931 --> 57:49.882
Not happy in New Jersey
not working.

57:49.883 --> 57:51.258
- I don't know what-

57:51.259 --> 57:52.636
- Just don't drink anymore.

57:53.637 --> 57:55.179
- It's not that easy.

57:55.180 --> 57:57.723
- Try middle school.

57:57.724 --> 57:58.849
- Gladly.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.022
- Aren't there drugs
you can take?

58:00.023 --> 58:03.113
- I'm on just about every one
you can imagine.

58:03.114 --> 58:05.606
So are all the moms you can see.

58:05.607 --> 58:09.032
Except maybe Marta,
although she should be.

58:10.112 --> 58:11.455
- Real mature, Mom.

58:15.242 --> 58:18.587
- That will probably be the
highlight of my daylight hours.

58:20.831 --> 58:21.753
- I'm sorry.

58:21.754 --> 58:23.082
- No.

58:23.083 --> 58:24.426
<i>I am.</i>

58:26.378 --> 58:27.880
You should probably get going.

58:43.061 --> 58:45.062
Jesus.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.815
Fucking sharks.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.251
- Gracie.
- Good morning.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.003
- I need you to give me a hand.

59:09.004 --> 59:10.296
Empty all these.

59:10.297 --> 59:13.426
The ones with screw tops
you can pour down the sink.

59:13.427 --> 59:15.143
The ones with corks,
you can have.

59:15.144 --> 59:16.469
- No, I don't drink.

59:16.470 --> 59:17.938
- Oh, give them to your husband.

59:17.939 --> 59:20.523
Trust me, he'll be happy.

59:22.267 --> 59:23.268
Now.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.040
- Are you sure
about these French ones?

59:37.041 --> 59:38.282
He always say-

59:38.283 --> 59:40.206
- If he cared, he'd be here.

59:50.837 --> 59:51.929
- Where the hell have you been?

59:51.930 --> 59:52.967
- I'm on time, aren't I?

59:52.968 --> 59:54.807
- For the meeting two hours ago?

59:54.808 --> 59:56.884
- I'm sure you handled it fine.

59:56.885 --> 59:58.349
- I'm second fucking chair.

59:58.350 --> 59:59.892
- This is open and shut.

59:59.893 --> 01:00:01.515
They should've settled.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:15.950
- All rise.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:23.869
- Counselor,

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:27.873
I really hope you're not going
to use that in my courtroom.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.750
- Just turning it off,
Your Honor.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.876
<i>Hello, you've reached Jeffrey.</i>

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.006
<i>Please leave your name,
number, and a detailed message,</i>

01:00:34.007 --> 01:00:35.007
<i>and HI get-</i>

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.850
- Good morning, sunshine.

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:40.427
- Speaking of which,

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:41.896
where's that paperwork
I can sign myself out

01:00:41.897 --> 01:00:44.228
to see some
motherfucking sunshine?

01:00:44.229 --> 01:00:46.397
- What happened
to a child like you?

01:00:46.398 --> 01:00:47.643
- Meaning?

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.395
- Once you must was a good boy.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:50.648
Done what him told.

01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:52.365
How you gone so wrong?

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.110
- I was 14

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:59.202
in the basement of my
best friend's house in Maryland.

01:00:59.203 --> 01:01:02.041
Me and him snuck a bottle
of Sambuca down there.

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:03.993
Finished it between us.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.371
I ain't never looked back.

01:01:05.372 --> 01:01:07.121
- This ain't Sambuca.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:10.082
- Discovered the good stuff
a lot later.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.006
- And your friend?

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.217
- Now he a fancy nigger lawyer
who don't answer my calls.

01:01:18.218 --> 01:01:20.259
- Maybe him busy with him life.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.260
' Oh. yeah?

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.980
- You can't see you
in charge of yourself.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.681
You can't do nothing.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.183
- You think I don't know that?

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.607
- So why you here
in a bed got straps?

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.491
<i>- What then do ail these
thinkers we've examined</i>

01:01:38.492 --> 01:01:40.696
<i>this semester have in common?</i>

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:45.373
If we truly explore
to find a common thread?

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.463
At the outset of a century
that would constitute

01:01:48.464 --> 01:01:51.081
the bloodiest in human history,

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:55.085
along with scientific
and technological advancements

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:58.631
that would literally
make us like gods.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:02.927
Even as we began to dismantle
the very meaning of God,

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.601
they ask...

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.891
"'What is a life?"

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:15.940
Does to live
any longer have a how?

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:19.241
Does it any longer have a why?

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.748
<i>Against a backdrop
of industrialization,</i>

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:36.293
<i>people will contend
with alienation,</i>

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:37.878
<i>dislocation,</i>

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:40.714
<i>population on a mass scale,</i>

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:41.966
<i>and murder</i>

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.509
<i>on a mass scale.</i>

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:47.054
They'll consider
the constraints of truth,

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:49.515
whether metaphor or paradigm,

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:53.477
with many concluding
actual truth has never existed.

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:57.273
A nexus in the great human saga,

01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:01.151
<i>when we dared to trade
the organizing bliss</i>

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:03.404
<i>of good and evil,
right and wrong</i>

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:05.990
<i>as determined by a creator</i>

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:09.159
<i>for other opiates.</i>

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.328
Communism, socialism,

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:14.331
capitalism, psychology.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:17.876
Technology, any learnable system

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.879
to replace what had begun
to evaporate.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.548
The 20th century.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:23.924
My own,

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:28.095
<i>but also the one into which
each of you was born.</i>

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:34.601
<i>For many, an era of hope,
liberation, possibility.</i>

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:38.272
<i>For others,
of abandonment and despair.</i>

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:44.236
<i>A most human century
in which we begin</i>

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:48.032
<i>really to understand
that Nietzsche was right.</i>

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.701
<i>- We are beautifully,</i>

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:52.536
<i>finally,</i>

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.830
<i>achingly-</i> - -

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:58.709
<i>Alone.</i>

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.178
- <i>In this void,
philosophy at its worst</i>

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:12.222
<i>becomes self-reflective,</i>

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:15.017
<i>linguistic, semantic...</i>

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.018
- Typically, opposing counsel...

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:19.355
<i>- Relativism having rendered
any discussion</i>

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:23.567
<i>of right and wrong,
good and evil,</i>

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:27.196
<i>to be the quaint concerns
of another age.</i>

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:30.908
<i>At its most provocative,</i>

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:33.160
<i>it asks other questions.</i>

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:38.133
<i>Those concerned with locating
our stranded selves...</i>

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:42.178
When meaning seems to have died.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.675
- He's expecting your call.

01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:46.423
- So you gonna sign me out
or what?

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:50.015
<i>- Nothing less, in short,
than why do we live at all?</i>

01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:51.136
- Call him.
- Go there.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.597
- <i>And what makes us who we are?</i>

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.892
They ask.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.103
"'What now?"

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.647
And we're still asking it.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.775
What will fortify us
as another century,

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.655
your century, commences?

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:13.534
Do we abandon finally
the search for truths

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.755
that seem ever more elusive,
even silly to some?

01:05:16.756 --> 01:05:18.497
The ethical?
The moral?

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:19.498
The good?

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:24.211
<i>Principles that by definition
can never be proved</i>

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.381
<i>when so much now can be proved?</i>

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:31.802
<i>Or is all this finally
and forever pointless?</i>

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.429
<i>Are we done?</i>

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:39.852
<i>We can destroy cities,
alter the planet irreversibly,</i>

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:42.354
<i>speak instantaneously
face-to-face</i>

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.648
<i>from across the globe,</i>

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:48.402
create life where there was
to be none,

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:52.906
even while intoxicating
ourselves with it all.

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:57.286
And yet, how do we
still seek purpose?

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:01.915
And where do we hope
to find it if we're so busy

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:05.085
convincing ourselves
there needn't be any?

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.465
<i>And so we wander,</i>

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.634
<i>eyes closed to the dark,</i>

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:17.097
<i>while technology, science,
medicine, and godlessness</i>

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:20.142
<i>blaze illusions around us,</i>

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.979
<i>with less to guide us
now than ever.</i>

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.690
Seemingly omnipotent...

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.194
But more human,

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.945
<i>and just as afraid.</i>

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.867
<i>These quandaries do not end
with this course</i>

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:39.203
<i>a week from today.</i>

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.538
They begin,

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:44.166
and I certainly
haven't taught these writers

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:47.544
for 30 years just so you can
drop references

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:50.047
to existential thinkers
and their antecedents

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.298
at dinner parties.

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:58.055
The crowd is untruth.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.434
In an era darkened

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:06.188
by the false shade
of imperviousness,

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:11.193
you and those who
pause to question

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.320
carry the light.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.910
It's been a wonderful 34 years.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.297
Let's not be strangers.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:29.419
Either to one another
or, more importantly,

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.965
to everything we've learned
from one another.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:39.054
<i>May your best years
be yet to come.</i>

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:44.601
And so for us all.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:12.843
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.899
- Hey, what are you doing?
- That's my purse!

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.269
- Hey!
- We got to get my purse!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.147
- Motherfucker!

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.091
- So I heard you gave quite
the final lecture

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:00.801
in the survey course.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.429
- Well attended anyway.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.430
Students I hadn't seen in years.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.810
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.569
Th-this is me, so...

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:14.359
- You made a promise.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.109
- I know.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:18.444
- So?

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.072
- I-I
I can't.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.542
- I'll make me a willow cabin
at your gate.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.493
- Who's that?

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.912
"- Viola from 'Twelfth Night."

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:31.635
I said it to my wife
46 years ago when I proposed.

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.800
- You're gonna be late
getting back to her, so...

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:37.798
- And later still
the longer we tarry.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.267
- I can just get another one.

01:09:39.268 --> 01:09:40.801
I can use cigarettes.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.804
- A moment at a time.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.819
Mm.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.072
- Sophie.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.167
Thank you.

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.088
- You're worth it.

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:25.595
<i>- Where are you?</i>

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:26.893
- I was with a student.

01:10:26.894 --> 01:10:28.682
The one I told you about.

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.100
<i>- Should I wait up?</i>

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:32.018
- If you can.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.020
I won't be ten minutes more.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.105
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:37.607
- Hey, what's going on, my man?

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.177
- You're late tonight, sir.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:08.352
- In all the years coming here,
I've never told you my name.

01:11:08.353 --> 01:11:09.931
It's Walter.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:13.268
It would make me so happy
if you called me that.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.936
- Walter.
- Ignacio.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.731
- Good evening.
- Hi.

01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:23.447
- The allure of that never
fades, I'm happy to report.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.407
- Couple of bunches
of hydrangeas?

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:28.408
- You got it.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:29.581
- Have a good workout tonight,
ladies?

01:11:29.582 --> 01:11:30.994
- Yeah.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.838
- Your dog is cute, very cute.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:41.797
- Got to have milk, don't you?

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.716
Drink milk all my life.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.968
Maybe you drunk milk too.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.017
Look like you live
the good life.

01:11:49.018 --> 01:11:50.722
- I have actually.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.225
- What's the secret?

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.312
- You can't imagine
how ironic it is

01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:57.655
that you're asking me
that today.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.069
Perhaps it's as simple
as enjoying a glass of milk

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:04.110
or buying flowers
for your wife every Friday,

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.952
which I've done
for as long as I can remember,

01:12:05.953 --> 01:12:06.948
and which I shall do now.

01:12:06.949 --> 01:12:09.417
- Could you loan me five bucks?

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.044
- For?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:14.621
- Gonna buy drugs.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.499
Which I need awful bad.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.877
Hungry too.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.299
- I'm gonna give this
to the men at the register

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.299
and tell him you can have
anything in the store

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.218
one can eat up to $5 worth,

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:30.183
and that he is to keep
the change.

01:12:30.184 --> 01:12:32.227
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:35.021
And if you ever
see me around here,

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:36.518
I'll always do the same for you,

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.021
so long as I'm able.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.863
Simplicity of the divine.

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:48.613
- You've read Augustine?

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:49.990
- Not everything.

01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:52.367
- Don't worry, no one has.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.494
- And in translation too.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:57.294
- I'd be lying if I said I
didn't need a moment to process

01:12:57.295 --> 01:13:01.011
where this conversation
has suddenly veered.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.598
- Come on, man, just help me
out with 50¢, anything.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.218
Yeah, you better walk
away, motherfuckers!

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.140
Yo, mister,

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.309
let me get 50¢, man.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.978
- I'll get you a cup of coffee.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.689
- I want 50¢.
- Sorry.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.317
Maybe you should let these
young ladies get to their dog.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.070
- You gonna tell me what to do
in my neighborhood?

01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:28.366
- I've lived here 25 years,

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:30.831
but no, it's just a request.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:40.750
- Thanks.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.422
- Thank you.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.507
- Have a good night, Walter.

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:50.976
- Good night, Ignacio.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:02.479
- Excuse me.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.902
He-he buy that for you?

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:06.232
- That he did.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.359
- Anyone who ask,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.611
he always.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.363
<i>Buena suerta, si?</i>

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.162
- Gonna need that too.

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:22.832
- Hey, bud.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.676
- Hmm?
- You dropped something.

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:32.759
- Help!

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.353
Help! Help!

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:40.602
Help me!

01:14:40.603 --> 01:14:43.103
Help me!

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.188
- Yes?
- me!

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.523
- Help me, please!
- Who is this?

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.524
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.243
<i>- Help me!
- I'm buzzing you in.</i>

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:05.709
- Hey!

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.305
- Do it, motherfucker!

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:16.094
No, mother-this ain't
your fucking business!

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:26.521
You're doing me a favor.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:29.149
- A favor?

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.610
End this shit for good.

01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.137
- Hal?

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.765
Ella?

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.642
Guys?

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:05.643
- You're back?

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:08.271
Is it-why didn't you call?

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.272
- Get Hal.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.487
- Can you at least tell me?

01:16:10.488 --> 01:16:12.736
- No, not until
you're both down here.

01:16:12.737 --> 01:16:14.863
- We think I'm gonna
be fine, honey.

01:16:14.864 --> 01:16:16.946
It was just a big scare.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.948
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.576
- Ah, careful, honey.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:22.791
Go get your brother.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.707
- That might be difficult.

01:16:25.708 --> 01:16:28.041
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.965
He's at Greg's getting stoned.

01:16:29.966 --> 01:16:31.294
- He's at Amy's.

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.546
He hopes losing his virginity.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:34.844
Her parents are away
for the weekend.

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:36.299
- <i>Oh.my...</i>

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.221
- He said he did
a risk assessment

01:16:38.222 --> 01:16:41.223
and the benefits outweighed
the potential negatives.

01:16:41.224 --> 01:16:43.056
- Jesus Christ.

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:46.061
- Honey, he can be in trouble
in the morning.

01:16:46.062 --> 01:16:47.477
Let's just be happy.

01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:49.479
Pour me a glass of wine.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.653
- You're a lot more
forgiving than I am.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.821
Mom?

vertical laceration

01:18:25.786 --> 01:18:27.661
in the mid epigastrium.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.086
Abrasions to the head.

01:18:32.087 --> 01:18:33.583
- You guys get service
down here?

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:34.584
- There is an air shaft.

01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:36.883
- Give me a sec, will you?

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:48.723
- Mom?

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.063
- Oh, God.
- Where is he?

01:18:50.064 --> 01:18:52.355
What are they-
- In intensive care.

01:18:52.356 --> 01:18:55.027
- He lost so much blood.
- But do they say if he-

01:18:55.028 --> 01:18:57.899
- I don't know.
I'm so afraid to ask.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.567
- Excuse me.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.782
- Do you mind?
- I-I'm sorry.

01:19:00.783 --> 01:19:03.281
Are you the family
of the man who, uh...

01:19:03.282 --> 01:19:04.364
- Yeah.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.459
- I was just, uh, speaking
with the police back at-

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:10.713
I-in any case, your husband
asked me to give you these.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.501
- What did he say to you?

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:20.964
- Just, uh, just
to give you those flowers

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:25.311
and that-that he never
missed a Friday.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:28.055
- Anything else?

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.267
- I probably misheard.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.270
- Please.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:37.898
Please.

01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:41.025
- Cabbages.

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:43.528
I'm planting cabbages.

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:53.915
- Oh, God.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:56.417
Perfect.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:19:59.002
- Thanks.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.004
- I'm sorry.

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:06.973
- Mom?

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.107
It's from Montaigne.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:22.317
"I want death to find me

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:25.486
"planting my cabbages,

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:28.072
"careless of death,

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.366
"and still more

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:32.836
of my unfinished garden."

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:57.894
- Hello?

01:20:57.895 --> 01:20:59.854
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:02.482
- Sam?
- Is that you?

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.525
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.319
I, uh, I miss you.

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:10.156
<i>I want to come home.</i>

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:17.372
<i>- That's not gonna he so simple.</i>

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.668
For either of us.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:24.842
<i>Forget that you're not even
in China.</i>

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:27.882
<i>- Sarah-
- Forget where you really are.</i>

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.301
Probably the city
for all I know.

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:33.598
I don't even care at this point,

01:21:33.599 --> 01:21:36.349
<i>which is terrifying in itself.</i>

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:42.939
I'm not gonna be what
I've turned into anymore.

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:45.691
<i>- Neither am I.</i>

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.076
- I don't believe you, Sam.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.659
<i>Any more than you believe me.</i>

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.994
- Sarah, it's been
a strange night.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:57.995
<i>- It should go without saying</i>

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:00.706
that I don't really
want to know.

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.583
- <i>No, it's not like that.
- ;-</i>

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.460
I'll explain it when we, uh-

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.634
<i>- I don't want to see you
right now, Sam.</i>

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:12.552
You want to come home?

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:14.976
Let's discuss it when you were
supposed to come back

01:22:14.977 --> 01:22:16.389
<i>from China.</i>

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.686
- Okay.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.438
- <i>And start thinking if this is</i>

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.731
<i>where you really want to be.</i>

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.125
- The issue is more
what the loss of blood

01:23:24.126 --> 01:23:26.000
did to his brain function

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.628
in addition to the trauma
of being stabbed.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:30.343
We can keep his heart beating,
but-

01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:32.592
- I-is my mother-in-law
aware of this'?

01:23:32.593 --> 01:23:34.434
- She's certainly
not leaving his side.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.136
- All right.

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:38.763
I'm gonna go in there.

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:41.142
- Can I, Dad?

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:43.477
- Sure.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.848
- Well, at least
he's not in any pain.
