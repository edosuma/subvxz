ROWE/VA: This is a powe/fu/ spell/200k,

00:05.160 --> 00:08.425
a tome of Druidic magic
called the Black Grimoire.

00:08.720 --> 00:09.823
A powerful spellbook shows up,

00:09.920 --> 00:11.387
and all of a sudden,
you're here to help?

00:11.600 --> 00:12.862
ROWE/VA: Do you want to break the curse
on your brother?

00:13.360 --> 00:14.782
We need to find that book.

LUCIFER: If you ’re looking for Rowena,
she is presently lho’isposeo;

00:29.040 --> 00:30.462
which is a delicate way of saying

00:30.560 --> 00:32.869
I stomped on her face
till the white meat showed,

00:33.560 --> 00:35.585
and then set her on ﬁre just In case.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.700
I don't need to waste my grace,
and there's plenty in the cupboard.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.217
Touch me and I'll--

00:40.560 --> 00:42.539
Don't worry.
I won't take it all.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.107
Save some for a rainy day.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.577
You would seem to be
the weak link on this team.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.429
Yes, my grace is a little bit depleted,
but give me time, man.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.540
Now you know better than
to screw with me, Asmodeus.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.200
I knew better than to screw
with the old you.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.427
(LUCIFER AND CASTIEL GROAN)

Lucifer could be useful.

(WOMEN LAUGHING)

01:53.120 --> 01:54.985

Excuse me.

(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

02:24.680 --> 02:25.942
Oh, my God. Hi.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.620
I was totally hoping we could talk.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.217
You want to talk with me?

02:30.720 --> 02:33.939
Mmm-hmm. I mean, you're so handsome.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.349
Really?

02:36.560 --> 02:38.585
- What's your name?
- Dale.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.143
I'm Jamie, and that's my sister Jennie.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.269
Y'all from around here?

02:47.440 --> 02:50.739
Nah, my sister and I are on our way
to this little town called Lebanon.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.667
- Heard of it?
-(CHUCKLES) I can't say that I have.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.748
You are so beautiful.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.263
Oh, thank you. (CHUCKLES SOFI'LY)

03:03.880 --> 03:07.828
Aanay, we're out of gas
and we're out Of money.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.679
Tragic, right?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.184
That is terrible.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.422
Well, what can I do for ya?
I'll do anything.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.909
(CHUCKLES)

03:19.000 --> 03:20.820
I knew you were our hero.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.742
The easiest thing

03:22.920 --> 03:25.059
would be to take all the money
from the register,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.666
grab a couple bottles of good vodka,

03:29.440 --> 03:30.657
and bring it outside.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.505
- What about Marty?
- What about him?

03:55.440 --> 03:56.429
Finally.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.519
Got it for you, baby.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.657
What's with the hammer?

04:05.960 --> 04:08.269
Oh, my God, sexy, it's just for in case.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.702
Like, for protection.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.347
This is a dangerous place at night.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.297
I mean, that guy in there
totally just got killed.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.742
Oh, don't worry. I won't let
anything bad happen to you.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.902
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you, too.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.300
- Dale.
- Right. Yes.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.500
But don't worry, Dale.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.058
Our mom taught us
three really important steps

04:30.160 --> 04:31.229
to looking out for ourselves.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.307
Always look your best.
Never get attached to a man.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.301
And always make the death
look non-magical,

04:37.400 --> 04:38.719
so you don't attract hunters.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.109
The death?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.229
(GROANS)

got
Pnncw/e Phantasmagon'a.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.039
We have...

05:19.280 --> 05:21.225
Archive of the Unnatural Occurrences.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.262
And we ’ve got Jower et /Vuet.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.988
Kind of a weird name.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.189
(CHUCKLES)

05:27.360 --> 05:29.464
Jour et /Vuit.
It’s French.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.221
It
means
”The Book of Day and Night. ”

05:32.160 --> 05:33.377
Fancy.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.439
So this is everything that even mentions
some alternate realities.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.942
So there's bound to be
something in here

05:39.040 --> 05:40.462
that talks about
the Apocalypse World, right?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.586
- Yeah, maybe.
- Dude.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.462
I'm just saying, Dean,

05:44.560 --> 05:47.347
Jack was our way over there,
obviously, so with him gone...

05:47.720 --> 05:48.823
Okay, well, Jack's been gone before.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.427
We found him once.
We can find him again.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.737
No, no, he didn't run away.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.865
He is literally in
an alternate reality.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.101
Okay, so we'll just come up
with a plan B, Okay?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.100
You said it yourself. We just keep
our heads down and we do the work.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.469
You said that.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.621
And I was right. Yeah.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.946
So you read, do your Sam thing.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.389
I'm gonna go for a beer run.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.862
Yeah.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.708
We should probably
loop Cass in at some point.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.987
We'll fill him in when he calls.
He checks in every day.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.939

Yeah, with
a
bunch
of questions and no leads.

. I’m sure he is
do/ng the best he can.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.221
Just go get beer or...

06:40.520 --> 06:41.544
Huh.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.060
Always thought
you'd have a bigger stick.

06:47.880 --> 06:48.904
What's your name again?

06:49.360 --> 06:51.066
They call me Dipper.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.380
(CHUCKLES) And you let them.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.827
Listen, Dipper,

06:56.960 --> 06:58.348
it's not the size Of the stick,

06:59.080 --> 07:00.263
it's how you use it.

07:00.800 --> 07:06.340
Funniest thing. I'm always hearing that
from guys with little sticks.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.269
(LAUGHs SARCASTICALLY)

07:13.800 --> 07:14.789
Smooth.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.181
We gave the warding a little kick.

07:17.880 --> 07:18.869
Just for you.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.737
Thanks. SO considerate.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.417
Appreciate that a lot.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.502
You're not nice, and I don't like you.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.901
You're treating me like
an everyday angel!

07:29.000 --> 07:31.662
And if I had just a little more power,
I could tear this place apart!

07:31.920 --> 07:33.262
Just saying.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.737
CASTIEL: You don't have that power,
and they know it.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.459
Okay, well, if somebody
would be a pal

07:45.560 --> 07:46.948
and let me eat a little of his grace,

07:47.040 --> 07:48.940
I would have enough strength
to get out Of here

07:49.040 --> 07:51.224
and butcher that son Of a bitch!

07:51.560 --> 07:53.744
Well, that's a nice, horrifying plan.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.582
A little cannibalism.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.740
Really? I seem to remember a somebody

07:58.840 --> 08:02.059
snacking on angel grace
once upon a time.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.063
There is no "I" in "team," Castiel.
I want you to remember that.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.586
Fine, whatever. I can wait.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.383
Asmodeus was
my weakest creation.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.959
CASTIEL: Oh, he was, was he?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.988
Doesn't seem that weak to me.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.457
Yeah, yeah, that whole
shape-shifty thing he does,

08:23.560 --> 08:24.663
I didn't give him that.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.502
But so what? The Old dog's
learned some new tricks.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.145
Eventually, he's gonna mess up.
Then he's mine. Okay?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.062
Excuses aside,

08:33.840 --> 08:36.502
you're saying that you're too weak

08:36.680 --> 08:38.705
to overcome even your weakest creation.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.257
Shut up.

I think you might be right.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.228
I think maybe it's time
to go ahead and call Cass,

10:06.320 --> 10:08.663
because, I mean, if...

10:12.880 --> 10:15.542
- You all right?

She's sweet and she's beautiful,
and she's just kinda sorta perfect.

Sure. Right.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.063
And did she happen to ask
for that book by name?

10:58.400 --> 11:01.426
Yeah! I mean, isn't that
kind of cosmic fate,

actually wms.

when Michael gets here

and, yeah, murders us all?

14:03.440 --> 14:04.759
Right, if he gets here.

There's no "if" here
in this equation, okay?

about my dick brother,

of my dick brother, Okay?

When he decides to do
something, he does it.

or who has to die.

that's just the way he rolls.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.467
How much time? Oh...

14:30.560 --> 14:32.664
I guess that depends
on how much time he spends

'cause they're hard to swallow,

an angel stroke?

He's emotional.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.302
Remarkably intuitive.

15:33.400 --> 15:38.520
You know, uh, he resurrected me
just out Of instinct.

He doesn't even really
look like you.

How are you alive?

16:25.240 --> 16:29.700
Lucifer told us he killed you
pretty graphically.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.781
And he did.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.342
But I take precautions to ensure
that if I die,

16:36.040 --> 16:37.143
it is temporary.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.979
it took a very long time
to heal.

And I'm not interested in it
ever happening again,

16:49.480 --> 16:51.664
which is why I need
the Black Grimoire.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.347
What a coincidence.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.386
You happen to Show up
right when it's stolen.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.947
Oh, no coincidence.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.381
I felt the book moving.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.703
In a moment Of weakness, I may
have put a tracking Spell

17:02.800 --> 17:04.665
on the Grimoire behind your backs.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.297
Moment of weakness, huh?
Right.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.867
Why do you want it so bad?
Why now?

17:09.480 --> 17:12.745
Years ago, the Grand Coven
cast a binding Spell,

17:13.600 --> 17:16.057
limiting aspects Of my magic.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.460
There's a page in the Grimoire
that may help.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.657

Yeah, that's what we want.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.781
- Help me protect myself.
- Let me get this straight.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.902
You felt the book moving
and you decided, what?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.945
You'd Show up and just take it?

17:32.040 --> 17:34.941
Well, I thought about asking you
nicely for it, but...

17:35.040 --> 17:36.940
Yeah, but you knew we'd
tell you to go to Hell.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.302
Exactly.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.820
Now I'm worried the girls
will damage the book,

17:41.920 --> 17:43.785
and you're worried about
the awful things

18:04.200 --> 18:06.304
Having your Skull crushed
and being burned alive

rather have a living son,

than a dead hero.

in another reality. So...

an abusive relationship.

some credit.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.057
I don't really talk about it,
not even with Dean.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.180
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Getting beat up by a girl.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.827
That's a story
I wanna tell someone.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.262
Girls beat us up all the time.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.860
Hmm, true.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.017
Hey, you know that Rowena
is not our friend, right?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.342
Yeah, I know that.

38:25.880 --> 38:26.869
Hmm.

38:31.960 --> 38:32.949
Then what's that?

38:35.880 --> 38:37.302
You gave her the page.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.499
- She got in your head, man.
- She didn't get in my head.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.507
Look, what happened to Rowena
was messed up, okay?

38:43.600 --> 38:45.500
But you just let the deadliest witch
in the world

38:45.600 --> 38:47.147
walk away with a page from this book.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.789
Yeah, and if Rowena breaks bad,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.707
I will hunt her down myself
and put a bullet in her.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.103
I will, Dean.

38:57.720 --> 39:01.599
But if she's right, and if
she does see Lucifer again,

39:01.840 --> 39:02.977
then".

39:04.840 --> 39:06.057
I hope she makes him suffer.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.946
You gotta get out of this dark place.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.302
You know, whatever's
going on in your head...

39:13.920 --> 39:15.387
- Dean...
- What?

39:16.640 --> 39:18.779
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

39:20.120 --> 39:22.987
- You know what? Honestly?
- Yeah, how 'bout honestly?

39:25.840 --> 39:27.262
I know what Rowena is dealing with.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.780
And she's not the only one who...

39:32.800 --> 39:34.017
Feels helpless.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.147
What do you mean?

39:42.280 --> 39:45.340
It means, I had a plan, you know. I...

39:46.000 --> 39:48.264
Help Jack, bring Mom back.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.783
It wasn't much, but it was something.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.661
It kept me from
spinning Off the rails.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.786
And now... Jack is gone,

39:57.880 --> 39:59.859
Mom is still in Hell, basically,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.501
and Ijust...

40:04.440 --> 40:05.623
We'll figure it out.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.905
Dean, we don't have a plan.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.706
We don't know what to do.
So, how?

40:15.600 --> 40:16.703
I don't know.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.346
But we will, you and me.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.737
Yeah.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.949
Night.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.267
