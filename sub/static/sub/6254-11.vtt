while animal bone doesn’t.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.728
No,no,no,no,no.
There’s gotta be another test.
You don’t lick bones.

11:37.823 --> 11:42.237
Who licks bones?
This place is starting to look
like a serial killer’s lair.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.192
This must be the manifesto.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.869
[Brennan]
No.

11:45.956 --> 11:49.119
These bones are not
the victims of a serial killer.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.245
Oh, what, you can tell that
by licking them too?

11:53.964 --> 11:56.546
If this documentation
is correct,

11:56.633 --> 11:59.215
these remains date back
to Paleolithic times.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.918
What do you mean,
like dinosaur times?

12:01.013 --> 12:04.881
No, Booth.
Homo sap/ens and dinosaurs
never coexisted, but—

12:04.975 --> 12:07.887
These remains are
thousands of years old.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.094
Thousands?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.605
This is an amazing find.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.400
According to the victim’s notes,
all the remains were found...

12:17.487 --> 12:20.149
at the same dig site
near Lake Kezenoi
in Chechnya.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.822
So Dr. Sutton might not have
been such a hack after all.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.743
Just because he had them
doesn’t mean he knew
their importance.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.330
All of his notes
are well organized.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.029
I think he knew exactly
how valuable they are.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.115
Why are you even here,
Dr. Edison?

12:31.209 --> 12:34.417
He’s the resident anthropologist
in charge of ancient remains.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.665
I told him to take
the remains back to his lab.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.214
But this could be
a very important find.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.758
And since I have
written extensively...

12:41.845 --> 12:45.463
on ancient remains and was
recognized by the Cambridge
Archaeological Society...

12:45.557 --> 12:48.845
for my work on
the Lagar Velho finds,
I should be examining these.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.892
But we have a murder
to solve, Dr. Brennan.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.595
Crime, you.
Ancient history, me.
Remember?

12:53.690 --> 12:57.182
Yes. But I would think
you would want nothing more
than my expertise.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.314
I’m well aware you would
think that. But I don’t want
to take you from your murder.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.942
Could you please pack these up
and take these down to 407...

13:03.033 --> 13:04.694
in the anthropology suite,
please?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.616
No, I don’t believe this.
ltaughtyou.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.912
And I’m very grateful.
I promise, you’ll be thanked
when I publish.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.957
The tests on
the remaining tissue...

13:14.044 --> 13:15.830
show no signs of contusions.

13:15.963 --> 13:19.171
Excuse me?
Our murder victim.
From this millennium.

13:19.257 --> 13:23.296
Fine. But I just hope
that I’m available
when Dr. Edison needs help.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.215
[Sighs]

13:34.940 --> 13:37.101
Hey.
Hi.
I’m almost done.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.558
Just removing the last
of the particulates
that I found.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.357
Where’s Dr. B.?
Oh, in her office,

13:42.447 --> 13:45.939
trying to accept that Dr. Edison
is in charge of the old bones.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.525
— Oh.
- Yeah.
She’ll be okay.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.283
— Yeah, that’s not true.
— I know.
She’s very competitive.

13:52.374 --> 13:55.491
You think?
Clark has no idea what
he’s getting himself into.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.998
— Now, Dr. Brennan knows
the boundaries.
- You really believe that?

13:59.089 --> 14:01.171
Absolutely.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.421
Not.
Can we get back to the murder?

14:04.553 --> 14:06.339
It’s so much easier
to deal with.
Right.

14:06.430 --> 14:10.890
So, I found some particulates
embedded in the scraping wound
on the back of the ribs.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.929
Any idea what it is?
Well, no.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.926
Dr. Brennan thought
that there was evidence—
[Cell Phone Beeping ]

14:15.022 --> 14:17.058
that animals might have
gotten to the remains.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.232
So maybe they left ’em.
I’ll run it through
the mass spec and—

14:20.318 --> 14:22.400
Oh, man.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.273
Clark says
that he needs me.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.696
[ Sighs ]
I don’t want to get in between
him and Dr. Brennan.

14:26.783 --> 14:31.152
And you also have particulates
to analyze, don’t you?

14:31.246 --> 14:33.737
Right. Yes. Good.
Thank you.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.948
I am on it.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.457
The last appointment
that Sutton had before he died
was with his publisher.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.166
Hey, look, maybe she can
give us something.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.344
Dr. Edison is going to
make a fool of himself
without my help.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.467
Right. Okay.
Are you even
listening to me?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.719
— What?
- Oh, wow, okay.
I guess not.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.348
Look, it’s Clark’s job.
It’s Clark’s job, not yours.
Just let it go.

14:57.439 --> 15:01.648
Do you think it’s right
not to have the best person
analyze the remains?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.852
Maybe you’re afraid
that he’ll do just fine
without you.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.938
— Excuse me?
- I’m just saying, it’s—

15:08.033 --> 15:10.024
Is this about the bones,
or is this about you?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.109
I believe they are
one and the same.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.990
Does that apply
to Christine too?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.493
What? Are you saying
that I use Christine
to make myself look good?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.790
Oh, your words, not mine.

15:18.877 --> 15:22.415
I am just saying that Clark
might do things his own way,

15:22.506 --> 15:24.042
and the same
holds true for Christine.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.748
— Shouldn’t we be focusing
on the case?
— That’s a good idea.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.959
These books Sutton wrote
are dreadful.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.841
What publisher would allow
such inaccuracies?

15:31.973 --> 15:35.591
Well, I’m thinking one
that wanted to make money off
a modern—day Indiana Jones, huh?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.516
It’s all about the cash.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.429
I still can’t believe
Jim’s dead.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.516
We fixed time of death
at three days ago.

15:43.652 --> 15:46.769
When was the last time
you spoke to him?
Um, about a month ago.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.276
He called from Grozny,
said that he had made
an important find.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.449
We were supposed to
talk about it last Friday.

15:52.577 --> 15:56.115
Did he say exactly what it was
that he found in Chechnya?
No.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.414
But he was very excited,
and he said that he was
finally going to be able...

15:59.501 --> 16:01.833
to publish something
of real scientific merit.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.833
So he knew that
his previous books were
sensationalistic nonsense.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.757
- Bones.
— We prefer to view them as...

16:08.844 --> 16:12.632
an accessible way
for the public to get
introduced to archaeology.

16:12.722 --> 16:16.010
But an entire book
on fossilized
dinosaur eggs?

16:16.101 --> 16:19.264
It was quite successful
in the youth market.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.221
The profits from these books—
did they pay
for his expeditions?

16:22.315 --> 16:25.022
Not exactly.
What he would do is feature...

16:25.110 --> 16:27.146
an artifact in the book
and then sell it.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.070
Tell you the truth,
it was almost always
to the same guy.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.194
- Who was this man?
- All I know is he’s
a businessman in Texas.

16:33.285 --> 16:36.118
— l— I never got his name.
- And these artifacts
were legal?

16:36.204 --> 16:37.660
I don’t know.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.739
l have absolutely nothing to do
with that part of the business.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.415
25,000 years—
you’d think that they’d
just have a fire pit.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.294
Homo sap/ens already had
tens of thousands of years
of working with fire.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.967
The stones found at the site
indicate a domed hearth.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.387
[ Sighs ]
This is all just
becoming so real.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.260
| just want to put faces
on them all.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.307
Well, the skulls
are there for you.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.807
My paper would definitely
be enhanced with illustrations.

17:02.898 --> 17:06.356
Hi, Angie.
I got your text.
What are you doing here?

17:06.443 --> 17:09.105
Making history live,
and you are gonna help.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.562
Oh. Um,

17:11.656 --> 17:15.114
I’d rather not
get between Clark
and Dr. Brennan.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.864
Hodgins, we just need to know
the plant and insect life...

17:17.954 --> 17:20.696
in the Northern Caucasus
25,000 years ago.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.577
Wait a minute. Wait.
Are you actually
afraid of Brennan?

17:23.668 --> 17:25.784
Yeah.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.835
More than you are of me?

17:27.923 --> 17:32.963
Epigaea gau/theroio’es
was common, as was
Betu/a medwede Wii.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.304
Could you put that
in the binder?
Mm—hmm.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.764
We tracked down the guy that
Sutton sold his artifacts to.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.392
Wayne Wilson.
Texas oil money.
Spends a lot of time in DC.

17:46.483 --> 17:47.973
Wilson is a fundamentalist.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.151
He’s the sole support
of the country’s largest
creationist museum.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.237
Are you saying he’s one of those
guys who believes that the world
is 6,000 years old?

17:54.324 --> 17:58.408
And yet he routinely
bought artifacts from Sutton
that were way older.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.408
Why would a true believer
buy artifacts that he refuses
to believe even exist?

18:02.499 --> 18:04.535
Perhaps he suffered
a crisis of faith.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.742
The psychological stability
of the true believer...

18:06.836 --> 18:09.543
rests entirely on
a superior posited authority.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.792
Now if that authority
is removed or questioned—

18:11.883 --> 18:14.795
— The guy goes wacky.
- l was gonna use
a more technical term.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.626
That’s why I interrupted you.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.336
All right, look.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.296
According to Sutton’s e—mails,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.599
Wilson funded his entire trip
and was getting angry...

18:22.686 --> 18:24.176
’cause Sutton wouldn’t
turn over the bones.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.853
| tell you what.
You to talk to Wilson,
do your “shrinky” thing.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.521
See if he, you know,
flipped out.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.356
Gonna do
my “shrinky” thing.
Go.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.485
[ Hodgins ]
These conifers would
have provided cover...

18:38.576 --> 18:41.283
so that the fire
wouldn’t be seen by predators.

18:41.371 --> 18:45.865
Width of distal epiphysis
is 3.74 centimeters.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.663
Dr. Brennan, hi.
You know, I was just leaving.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.416
There would be a shelter
next to the hearth...

18:52.507 --> 18:54.589
made from branches
and animal skins...

18:54.676 --> 18:56.587
with a ground cover
made of leaves.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.543
I know. We were just
getting that stuff—

18:58.638 --> 19:01.300
And moss should be used
in the fire as well as wood.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.845
Yeah—
I was told that
you found particulates...

19:03.935 --> 19:06.347
in the scraping wound
on the rib, Dr. Hodgins.

19:06.438 --> 19:09.145
Yes. Yeah.
Dried tissue.
Some kind of hide.

19:09.232 --> 19:12.816
Um, l’m—l’m assembling
a list of potential objects
that could be made from it.

19:12.944 --> 19:17.358
Seems to me you are gardening.
We are in the middle of a murder
investigation, Dr. Hodgins.

19:17.449 --> 19:20.065
It’s my fault.
I’m sorry.
I begged him.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.742
Look, this is becoming
an extraordinary find.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.820
l’ve discovered
the remains of four—

19:24.914 --> 19:27.166
No need to explain to me,
Dr. Edison.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.911
Crime is my domain.
This is yours.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.493
I know.
But as a fellow anthropologist,

19:31.588 --> 19:33.169
I thought you would be
interested to know...

19:33.256 --> 19:38.171
that these remains are both
Neanderthal and Homo sap/ens.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.594
In the same site?
No, I don’t think so.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.172
These pieces are from a skull
of a Homo sap/ens male.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.350
And we have the os coxae
and various metacarpals...

19:47.437 --> 19:49.894
and phalanges
of a Homo sap/ens female.

19:49.981 --> 19:54.224
And the rib and femur
of a Neanderthal male.

19:54.319 --> 19:58.483
— This is remarkable.
- And I have the femur,
mandible, humerus and skull...

19:58.573 --> 20:01.610
of a female child,
approximately three years old.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.568
Yeah, it’s very sad.
She was only a toddler.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.323
Do you know what this means?

20:06.414 --> 20:09.201
Homo sap/ens and Neanderthals
living together...

20:09.292 --> 20:13.160
in the same cave,
using the same resources.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.542
Look at you two, sharing.
It’s beautiful.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.669
Mixed tribe cohabitating.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.467
This is unprecedented.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.385
Oh— I do plan on
crediting you, Dr. Brennan.

20:26.476 --> 20:29.138
In a secondary capacity,
of course.

20:31.689 --> 20:35.602
I believe it is I who will be
crediting you in a secondary
capacity, Dr. Edison.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.229
Excuse me?

20:37.320 --> 20:41.063
The injury to the parietal
was caused by a blow
with a sharp weapon.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.900
This Homo sap/ens was murdered,
which is a crime.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.155
So these bones are now mine.

20:55.672 --> 20:59.256
Violence has plagued the human
race from the very beginning—
before language, before fire.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.333
It is the source of
the Cain and Abel myth.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.544
Yes, violence sucks.
But what sucks even more...

21:03.638 --> 21:06.425
is that the most
fascinating thing that’s ever
happened to me in my career...

21:06.516 --> 21:08.097
turns out to be a mere crime.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.597
So you agree
that the investigation
of this crime should fall to me.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.225
—Oh, you would like that,
wouldn’t you?
—Yes. That’s why I suggested it.

21:14.315 --> 21:18.524
The crimes you solve
are just mere current events.
This is history.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.853
Are you able to define
the exact moment at which
current events become history?

21:21.948 --> 21:24.985
— Yes. 100 years.
— [ Scoffs ] You just made
that up on the spot.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.443
[Voice Rising ]
This-This happened over
25 millennia ago, Dr. Brennan.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.745
Even you can’t count that
as “current events.”

21:30.832 --> 21:33.665
— It does in geologic terms.
- Well, luckily, neither one
of us is a geologist.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.285
Well, as it happens,
I had a paper published by
the Geological Society of America.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.371
And I’ve had two published
by Geophysical Systems.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.299
— Which is for
dilettantes and amateurs.
- [ Chuckling ] Oh, really?

21:42.385 --> 21:45.422
Whoa, whoa. Stop, stop.
What is going on here?

21:45.513 --> 21:48.175
Well, Dr. Brennan here
feels that because
these ancient individuals...

21:48.266 --> 21:51.133
died in a violent manner,
that somehow it’s
a forensic concern.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.640
And Dr. Edison
feels that history
began a hundred years ago.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.268
What? That’s not even
an accurate representation
of my meaning.

21:57.358 --> 22:00.600
— You can stop all this by simply
declaring this a homicide.
— Oh, no, she can’t.

22:00.695 --> 22:04.313
Yes, I can.
It’s a technicality, but we live
in a world of technicalities.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.614
- World of technicalities.
- But...

22:06.701 --> 22:08.487
I’m not gonna do that.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.864
Clark can keep the bones here.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.162
- Dr. Brennan can have access—
— No. But—

22:13.249 --> 22:16.741
And if either one of you
says another word, I’m gonna
rule in favor of the other.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.294
Now drop the egos
and figure out what happened
to this poor caveman.

22:24.093 --> 22:27.005
Could you believe
she just called him a caveman?
Unforgivable.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.678
But I’m not saying
anything else until I’m
completely certain she’s gone.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.093
[ Saroyan ]
I can hear you.
Damn.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.596
Mr. Wilson, how long ago
was the Earth created?

22:39.275 --> 22:44.486
I believe you’re asking me if I
believe in the Book of Genesis,
which I do.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.403
Mm—hmm.
So 6,000 years?

22:46.491 --> 22:48.402
According to the Bible.

22:48.493 --> 22:52.031
Scientists tell us
that the universe is
13 billion years old,

22:52.121 --> 22:54.077
and the Earth
four—and—a-half
billion years old.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.577
Well,
who you gonna believe?

22:56.668 --> 22:59.626
God or a bunch
of scientists?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.454
You own an oil company?

23:02.549 --> 23:06.588
Does God tell you where to dig,
or do you count on a bunch
of scientists to tell you?

23:06.678 --> 23:09.920
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
| get what’s happening here.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.629
What’s happening here?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.591
The FBI. sent a psychologist
to ask me questions...

23:14.686 --> 23:17.598
because they want to know
ifl am a religious fanatic.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.554
Well, I know that
you’re religious, sir.

23:19.649 --> 23:23.688
What I’m trying to figure out
is if your religious convictions
led you to kill James Sutton.

23:23.778 --> 23:26.360
“Fear them not therefore:
for there is nothing covered...

23:26.447 --> 23:28.403
that shall not be revealed,

23:28.491 --> 23:30.857
and hid
that shall not be known.”

- Book of Matthew.
— “Thou shalt not murder.”

[ Chuckles ]

23:37.000 --> 23:40.538
I keep the Commandments,
Dr. Sweets, all 10 of ’em.

23:40.628 --> 23:45.463
You bought these fossilized
dinosaur eggs from Sutton.

23:45.550 --> 23:49.134
Correction.
I bought those rocks
from Mr. Sutton.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.926
Mmm.

23:51.014 --> 23:55.132
You also bought
this figurine that Sutton
found in northern Germany...

23:55.226 --> 23:57.262
dated at approximately
32,000 years.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.344
Who doesn’t like a pretty girl?

23:59.439 --> 24:02.101
Plus, I love history.
I own a museum.

24:02.191 --> 24:05.558
None of the artifacts
you bought from Sutton
made it in your museum.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.268
It’s my museum, Dr. Sweets.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.649
I decide what does
and does not get into it.

24:09.741 --> 24:13.404
Do you destroy
the items that contradict
your creationist views,

24:13.494 --> 24:16.236
or do you simply
lock them away where
they can’t do any harm?

24:16.331 --> 24:20.244
We all do
what we can do to make
the world a better place.

24:20.335 --> 24:23.498
You fronted Sutton money
to go to Chechnya...

24:23.588 --> 24:26.671
because he was after bones
that were 25,000 years old.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.919
They call it
the Chechen Republic now.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.797
Right. Now Sutton
refused to sell you...

24:31.888 --> 24:33.799
what he found and for which
you’d already paid.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.882
Probably because he knew
that you’d destroy ’em
or lock ’em away.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.266
He stole from me.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.219
That’s a fact.

24:43.358 --> 24:47.977
The Bible calls lying
“bearing false witness,” right?

24:48.071 --> 24:51.984
So I have to ask,

24:52.075 --> 24:55.033
did God tell you
to kill James Sutton?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.913
You know what God
is telling me right now?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.791
— To get a lawyer?
— See there?

25:04.879 --> 25:08.963
The word of God is audible
to all of those who listen.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.755

25:22.397 --> 25:24.103
Why are you
so depressed?

of your marshmallows?

25:25.775 --> 25:29.017
[ Chuckles ]
Well, my “happy tribe” theory
is kaput.

25:29.112 --> 25:32.070
The Homo sap/ens male
was clearly murdered
by a Neanderthal ax.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.610
Hmm.
What have you got there?

25:34.701 --> 25:38.535
My sketches of people
who lived 25,000 years ago.

25:38.621 --> 25:41.363
Wow, these are good.
You can see us in ’em.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.870
Yeah. We could be looking
at our own family, right?

25:44.961 --> 25:47.577
— No.
— Because this family
stopped here?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.295
Yes.
You don’t know that.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.169
There could have been
a brother out hunting
that day...

25:52.260 --> 25:55.627
or a sister
gathering nuts and—

25:55.722 --> 25:59.260
I don’t actually know
what people did for
a living back then, so—

26:00.351 --> 26:01.852
This is wrong.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.392
No, I don’t think so.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.016
This child is way too short for
a Homo sap/ens three—year—old,

26:06.107 --> 26:08.689
especially compared to the height of
the two Homo sap/ens parents.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.391
Well, I got the measurements
from you, Clark.

26:10.486 --> 26:13.148
So if anybody’s wrong,
I think it was you.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.855
The only way
a Homo sap/ens child could
be this short and stocky...

26:15.950 --> 26:17.486
is if she inherited
traits from—

26:19.328 --> 26:20.989
Oh, my God.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.945
Wh—What?

26:23.040 --> 26:26.407
A shorter, thicker tibia
is more suited to
a Neanderthal than a human,

26:26.502 --> 26:28.413
which can only mean that—

26:28.504 --> 26:30.540
That the child is Neanderthal.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.792
Half Neanderthal.

26:32.884 --> 26:36.001
Well, yeah,
but then her father
isn’t her father.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.093
This is her father.
See, that’s not—

26:38.181 --> 26:39.637
I mean, I don’t think that—

26:39.724 --> 26:41.806

l’m freaking out right now.

26:41.893 --> 26:45.260
— Is this a new thing?
— Yeah, Angela.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.855
This is a new thing.

26:57.992 --> 27:00.108
Dr. Brennan?

27:00.203 --> 27:01.568
Yes?

27:01.662 --> 27:05.246
You seem to be looking
at both Sutton’s remains
and his notes.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.073
That’s accurate.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.829
Those are two different cases.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.831
One’s a murder
from a few days ago.

27:10.922 --> 27:13.880
The other is a murder
from 25,000 years ago.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.802
Yes.

27:16.886 --> 27:21.630
Dr. Brennan,
I know the Neanderthal case
is historic and exciting,

27:21.724 --> 27:23.931
but this man was murdered,

27:24.018 --> 27:27.101
and he left behind a widow
and a fatherless child.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.429
I think we should
find out who did it.

27:31.567 --> 27:35.901
l’ve cataloged
the injuries to
the ribs and spine.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.695
Yes, there are traces
of animal tissue in the bone.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.775
When I was in the Maldives,
I examined the remains
of a woman...

27:41.869 --> 27:45.282
who’d been tied to a tree
and whipped for cheating
on her husband.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.455
You think the animal tissue
is leather?

27:47.542 --> 27:51.626
Yes, I believe that
approximately two months
before he was killed,

27:51.712 --> 27:54.124
Dr. Sutton was flogged.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.380
I think I found it.
Ouch.

28:04.475 --> 28:06.511
Yeah, I got this from
the Russian History Room.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.765
It’s called a knout in English,
pronounced “ka—noot” in Russian.

28:09.856 --> 28:14.145
Here’s an interesting fact.
Most Germanic languages
still pronounce the silent “.”K

28:14.235 --> 28:16.692
So knight is “ka—night,”
knife is “ka—nife”—

28:16.779 --> 28:19.646
Fascinating.
So you think this is what
Sutton was beaten with?

28:19.740 --> 28:21.401
Flogged.
[Whip Cracks]

28:21.492 --> 28:23.869
Oh, yeah.
[Laughing]

28:23.995 --> 28:26.452
The tissue
was a tanned hide.
Leather?

28:26.539 --> 28:29.622
Um, yeah.
It was from a Siberian musk ox.

28:29.709 --> 28:33.042
Now, I ran it through
the isotopic mass spec...

28:33.129 --> 28:37.088
and was able to isolate
the geographic origin to
the Chechen Republic in Russia.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.586
That’s the area
where his dig was.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.167
Yeah. What did you find?

28:41.262 --> 28:44.720
Well, I have tissue samples
from his back.

28:44.849 --> 28:48.808
There’s scarring on them
that indicates that the flogging
took place about two months ago.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.886
Which would definitely
place him in Chechnya.

28:50.980 --> 28:55.940
The areas of impact on the flesh
are pale with abrasions,
bruising along both sides.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.439
It’s amazing that he survived
a beating like this.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.110
His wife was pregnant.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.812
He had something to live for.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.744
I’m surprised your brother
didn’t come with you this time.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.447
He’s working.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.203
Mrs. Sutton,
I know this is difficult,

29:13.294 --> 29:17.287
but telling us what happened
to your husband might
help us find who killed him.

Are you in danger?

29:20.927 --> 29:23.543

He was whipped.
You understand?

29:29.894 --> 29:31.885
Who did that to him?

29:34.231 --> 29:36.563

named Valentine.

didn’t want to give these up.

of a discovery like this.

Okay.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.569
Initially, I thought
all of these markings...

31:55.664 --> 31:59.248
came from predators,
but look at this.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.246
The nick on the
coracoid process.

32:01.337 --> 32:02.952
That’s not
from a predator?

32:03.047 --> 32:05.038
The teeth would have
to be very small.

32:05.132 --> 32:07.623
And young predators don’t
usually feed with adults.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.674
The adults bring
the food back to them.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.504
This injury had to
have been caused by
a weapon of some kind.

32:12.598 --> 32:16.386
The coracoid process
could only be exposed
if the arm was raised.

32:16.477 --> 32:19.640
As if the victim
were warding off an attack.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.437
The first blow
must have been
to the scapula.

32:22.525 --> 32:26.143
Which caused
this indentation here.

32:26.237 --> 32:29.400
Then the victim turns
to face the assailant,

32:29.490 --> 32:31.355
raises his arm
in a defensive posture—

32:31.450 --> 32:33.736
The murder weapon nicks
the coracoid process,

32:33.828 --> 32:36.285
then travels downward
into the armpit,

32:36.372 --> 32:38.658
slicing the axillary artery.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.873
He died of exsanguination.
Exsanguination.

32:40.960 --> 32:45.454
A completely severed axillary
would pump about 100 c.c.’s
of blood per heartbeat.

32:45.548 --> 32:49.336
At that rate, the victim
would have lost consciousness
in less than 30 seconds.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.587
And died in under a minute.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.295

When you bet, you lose.
You get desperate.
You bet more just to get that rush.

33:34.138 --> 33:35.753
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.590
No? I mean,
you were broke
two weeks ago.

33:38.684 --> 33:42.848
Then you get this.
Electronic transfer
from a Russian bank...

33:42.938 --> 33:44.803
for $20,000.

33:44.899 --> 33:47.015
Someone paid off
an old debt.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.394
Yeah, it’s possible.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.612
I’m thinking you come here
and you want to make it big.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.193
You go to Daddy to bail you out.
And he agrees on one condition.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.700
To restore the family honor,

34:01.790 --> 34:03.826
you had to take out
your sister’s husband.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.703
You shouldn’t talk about
my family like that.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.040
I can see that family
means a lot to you.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.921
You would do anything to protect
their honor. Am I right?

34:15.512 --> 34:17.969
I know my rights.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.514
And I don’t have to
talk to you anymore.

34:24.772 --> 34:27.559
So the nick
to the coracoid process
revealed microscopic fibers...

34:27.650 --> 34:29.641
of a dyed and coated linen.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.899
— Parts of
the victim’s clothing?
— No, because...

34:33.989 --> 34:37.152
the linen has been suffused
with polyurethane.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.325
- I don’t know what that means.
- Well, it’s—

34:39.411 --> 34:41.072
I know what it means, obviously.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.370
What I don’t understand
is its significance.

34:43.457 --> 34:45.163
Bookbinding.

34:45.251 --> 34:49.290
How could a book
out through the muscle tissue
and sever a major artery?

34:49.380 --> 34:51.587
I guess we’re looking for
something that’s covered
in bookbinder’s linen...

34:51.674 --> 34:53.585
that’s sharper than a book.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.801
That is correct.
I know what killed James Sutton.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.675
Wha— [ Sighs ]
Would you care
to share it with me?

35:00.808 --> 35:02.639
l have to get Booth.
Nope. Yeah, okay.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.342
I’ll just find out later.

35:07.856 --> 35:10.893
Just because I don’t have
an alibi does not mean
that I killed Jim.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.438
Doesn’t exactly
clear you either.
These books.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.521
— What about them?
- They cover
a wide range of topics...

35:16.615 --> 35:18.651
that would’ve been useful
in this killing.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.279
— [ Booth ]
Really? Like what?
- This book is about...

35:21.370 --> 35:23.031
how to commit
the perfect murder.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.158
[ Chuckling ]
Why would you publish
something like that?

35:25.249 --> 35:27.240
It was written by a man
on death row.

35:27.334 --> 35:30.246
How could he possibly
be an expert
on the perfect murder?

35:30.337 --> 35:32.714
Hmm.
What else we got here?

35:32.798 --> 35:34.959
Oh. Oh, look at this.
You missed one, Bones.

35:35.092 --> 35:37.959
“How to Remove Stains.”
[ Brennan ]
There’s blood on the floor here.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.339
I bet it says
to use bleach on blood.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.467
That doesn’t work.
You publish trash.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.891
I cut my foot on a rock
in the garden.
It bled a lot.

35:45.978 --> 35:49.141
— I estimate about two liters.
- Two liters. I’m surprised
you didn’t pass out.

35:49.231 --> 35:51.643
Okay, I’m sorry.
The bookends—
they come in pairs?

35:51.734 --> 35:54.897
- I only ever had one.
— Really? Not in
this picture you didn’t.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.693
| see two.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.987
This is a likely match
for the indentation...

35:59.074 --> 36:01.736
on the posterior surface
of Sutton’s scapula.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.990
So you’re saying that
I killed Jim with a bookend?

36:05.080 --> 36:07.162
[ Chuckles ]
That’s ludicrous.

36:07.249 --> 36:10.241
D.N.A. will tell us
if the blood on the floor
matches Sutton’s.

36:10.336 --> 36:13.794
It’s only a matter of time.
You come clean with us, I’ll
tell the judge you cooperated.

36:16.759 --> 36:19.501
When he called me from Russia,
I could hear it in his voice.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.711
— Something changed.
- He’d fallen in love.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.342
Oh, no.
It was never about her.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.515
We were a team.

36:26.602 --> 36:30.436
Until he decided to publish
in some ridiculous journal
for no pay...

36:30.522 --> 36:32.604
and leave me out of it.

36:33.275 --> 36:34.856
He betrayed me.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.559
He wanted to be
taken seriously
as an archaeologist,

36:37.654 --> 36:39.519
which is
a very high calling.

36:39.615 --> 36:42.698
You should’ve
let him have that.

36:42.785 --> 36:45.652
Well, you’re under arrest
for the murder
of Dr. James Sutton.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.611
[ Cries ]

36:52.127 --> 36:55.711
[ People Chattering ]

36:55.798 --> 36:57.459
Hello, everybody.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.040
We are extremely gratified...

37:00.177 --> 37:04.295
that there are so many people
who are interested in
what happened 25,000 years ago.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.130
Even the FBI.
is interested.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.511
— It was a crime.
- Well, F.B.l.’s
all about crime.

37:08.602 --> 37:12.140
— So can we get goin’ here?
- But I think this is
Clark’s story to tell.

37:12.231 --> 37:14.187
Dr. Edison.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.850
O-Okay, all right.
Yes, uh—

37:17.945 --> 37:19.776
Are you gonna let Clark
have all this glory?

37:19.863 --> 37:21.819
He put it together.
I only helped.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.614
Dr. Hodgins, would you stand in
for the Neanderthal father?

37:24.701 --> 37:26.316
Yes.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.199
Dr. Saroyan,
would you be
the Homo sap/ens mother?

37:30.916 --> 37:32.872
- And, um—
— No.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.076
— No?
- Don’t even think about it.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.671
Okay.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.087
- Dr. Sweets,
would you be our interloper?
- Okay.

37:39.174 --> 37:42.086
All right, gentlemen,
could you go this way?
And I’ll call you when I need you.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.634
It was a warmish morning
in the late fall...

37:44.721 --> 37:46.257
in the foothills
of the Caucasus Mountains.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.259
- E—Excuse me, ifl may?
- Oh, boy.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.386
How do you know
it was a warmish morning?

37:51.770 --> 37:55.262
Uh, spores and fungi tell us
that it was a very warm autumn.

37:55.357 --> 37:58.690
- [Woman Chuckles]
— [ Chuckles ]
Bug boy.

37:58.777 --> 38:03.146
Mom was grinding acorns
into paste between rocks.

38:03.240 --> 38:06.107
The grinding rocks were
a part of Sutton’s find,

38:06.201 --> 38:08.453
as were some acorn hUSkS.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.198
A very warm autumn.

38:12.082 --> 38:14.323
— Yes.
— Now, there was a little girl,

38:14.418 --> 38:18.878
only three years old,
who was sleeping under
some skins here in the shelter.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.172
Which is our cue for Dad
to come in with dinner.

38:22.259 --> 38:25.217
Right, good.
[ Clears Throat]
Hark! I bring thee meat,

38:25.304 --> 38:27.340
which we thus
shall feast upon and—

38:27.431 --> 38:29.638
Hey, honey—
it’s not Shakespeare.

38:29.725 --> 38:33.309
Right. Yes. Good. Sorry.
Um— Um— Rah, caveman.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.602
[ Together]
Please don’t say “caveman.”

38:36.523 --> 38:38.855
This is not a family
like others.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.523
They were outcasts.

38:40.611 --> 38:44.399
This family lived apart
because they were not accepted.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.072
Time for the interloper.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.946
- What do I do?
- Throw your spear at Dad.

38:50.037 --> 38:52.699
- Why?
- We found
a greenstick fracture...

38:52.789 --> 38:54.450
on the father’s
left ninth rib...

38:54.541 --> 38:58.454
that is consistent with
the ballistic trajectory
of a thrown weapon.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.412
Homo sap/ens were the first
to throw a spear
at their prey...

39:01.507 --> 39:03.623
rather than simplyjab at it.

39:03.717 --> 39:06.049
Well, Homo sap/ens can go
straight to hell then.

39:06.178 --> 39:10.046
[Saroyan ] Oh, everyone in
this room’s Homo sap/ens.
Not me— I’m Neanderthal.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.803
[Grunting]

39:13.894 --> 39:17.352
Mom then attacked the interloper
with her grinding stone,

39:17.439 --> 39:20.351
fracturing his left humerus.

39:20.442 --> 39:23.559
He then retaliated
by striking her in the face.

39:23.654 --> 39:27.067
And down Mom went
with a broken jaw,

39:27.157 --> 39:28.863
and very likely
a crushed larynx.

39:28.951 --> 39:32.739
But her actions gave Dad time
to pick up his stone hatchet—

39:32.829 --> 39:35.036
[Grunts]

39:35.123 --> 39:36.579
and strike the interloper.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.874
- [ Both Grunt]
- Dude, lie down.
You’re dead.

39:38.961 --> 39:42.294
— I’m not gonna lie down.
- Well, you should. I just
split your skull wide open.

39:42.381 --> 39:45.669
Okay. All right. We got it.
The bad guy is dead.
What happened next?

39:45.759 --> 39:49.047
As I was saying,
the interloper
was killed instantly.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.844
The father bled out
in less than three minutes.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.888
What happened to the mother?

39:53.976 --> 39:56.809
Her larynx was crushed.
She suffocated to death.

39:58.355 --> 40:01.097
Okay, but the little girl—
she was okay, right?

40:01.191 --> 40:05.400
No, actually, she was only
three years old and—

40:05.487 --> 40:07.148
She was all alone.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.480
What the hell?
Why didn’t the other
villagers take her in?

40:09.575 --> 40:12.738
Because she was
half Homo sap/ens
and half Neanderthal.

40:12.828 --> 40:14.489
No one wanted her.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.912
The lines of arrest
on the child’s teeth...

40:16.999 --> 40:19.206
indicate that
she starved to death.

40:19.293 --> 40:20.749
Wow.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.417
So you’re saying the world’s
first hate crime...

40:22.504 --> 40:25.371
ended with the starvation
of a little girl?

40:25.465 --> 40:28.047
No. Booth,
it doesn’t end in hate.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.671
No, before he died,

40:29.761 --> 40:33.174
Dad crawled over to the mom
where they died together.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.597
- And then—
— The little girl’s
last action...

40:35.684 --> 40:37.675
was to come over...

40:37.769 --> 40:39.430
and lie down with her parents.

40:45.569 --> 40:48.276
Which is how Sutton
found the bones.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.069
Together.

41:02.044 --> 41:05.081
You know, that was really
nice of you to let Clark
have his moment, Bones.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.374
Well, I’m
a very nice person.
Yes, you are.

41:07.466 --> 41:10.048
You know what?
You’re very nice. You gotta
work on your modesty though.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.093
Well, I am being modest
because I actually
did something even nicer.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.387
- Oh, really? What was that?
- I told Clark...

41:15.474 --> 41:19.558
to replace my authorship credit
with Dr. James Sutton.

41:19.645 --> 41:23.558
That way, one day Sutton’s son
will see what a great
discovery he made.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.940
You’re right.
It was very nice.

41:29.071 --> 41:32.609
I don’t want to pass
my failings on
to Christine, Booth.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.315
— What failings?
_ Hyper—competitiveness,

41:35.410 --> 41:38.823
arrogance, insensitivity
to the feelings of others.

41:38.914 --> 41:42.247
You know what?
Thumbs—up for self—realization
there, Bones.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.825
Actually, two thumbs up.

41:48.131 --> 41:50.918
You should make
a similar effort.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.421
- What?
— Not to pass on your failings.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean?
What failings?

41:56.181 --> 41:58.513
Oh, it’s time for bed.
[ Babbles ]

41:58.600 --> 42:00.386
— Wait, what failings?
— You know.

42:00.477 --> 42:03.184
We’re gonna have a bath.
We’ll get yourjammies on.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.432
What, is this because
I won’t walk under ladders?

42:05.524 --> 42:07.936
We’ll have some milk,
wash your hair.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.642
Oh. What is this,
my sweet tooth?

42:11.530 --> 42:12.895
Yeah.

42:12.989 --> 42:16.072
So I like to have a beer
every once in a while
in the bathtub.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.491
What’s so bad about that?

42:18.578 --> 42:20.079
What failings?

42:54.614 --> 42:55.990
What’s that mean?
