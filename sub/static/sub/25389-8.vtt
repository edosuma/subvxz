WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:04.166
CORTEZ: Previously
on "Queen of the South"...

00:04.200 --> 00:06.498
JAMES: That's
County Sheriff Jed Mayo.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.632
Harassing illegals
is his favorite hobby.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.365
-Good news is...
-(yells)

00:09.410 --> 00:11.503
JAMES: He's for sale.
TERESA: Sheriff Mayo.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.303
-What do you know about Mayo?
TERESA: He's setting up

00:13.340 --> 00:15.171
roadblocks on your routes.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.541
What if I could do something
about him?

00:16.580 --> 00:18.047
You get the sheriff
to stand down,

00:18.080 --> 00:19.672
you can write your own ticket.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.813
(gunfire)

00:21.850 --> 00:23.215
(groans)

00:24.250 --> 00:25.740
Vmonos.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.553
NEWSCASTER: Sheriff Mayo
is in critical condition.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.421
JAMES: If he survives,
we're done.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.382
La Comisin will
come after us hard.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.159
Pote, open the door.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.418
-No, Teresa, you need to rest.
-Open the door, Pote!

00:35.460 --> 00:38.668
Isabela is still sneaking out
to meet with Kique Jimenez.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.260
CAMILA: Isabela's disobedience
is putting her at risk.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.837
If we were to kidnap the boy,

00:43.870 --> 00:45.064
then we could use him.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.704
Do it, but no one can harm him

00:47.740 --> 00:49.378
under any circumstances.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.401
CORTEZ_: I_ will send
my most discrpllned men.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.372
(nail gun fires)
(screams)

00:53.420 --> 00:55.615
(nail gun fires)
(screams, chokes)

00:55.650 --> 00:58.210
Whatever you've done
you don't need to hide from me.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.888
We're in this together.

01:01.990 --> 01:04.083
I'm rolling the dice
on you, Teresa.

01:04.130 --> 01:06.098
You won't regret it.

01:06.130 --> 01:07.620
Follow me.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.629
(dramatic music)

01:10.670 --> 01:13.798
*

01:13.840 --> 01:16.468
(vehicle approaching)

01:21.310 --> 01:24.473
(intense music)

01:24.510 --> 01:28.640
*

01:28.680 --> 01:31.148
Pull over! _
You're gonna get us killed.

01:31.190 --> 01:32.555
We can't lose the load.
We need this.

01:32.590 --> 01:39.189
*

01:42.670 --> 01:46.561
(children yelling)
(indistinct chatter)

01:46.600 --> 01:48.591
WOMAN:
Enough is enough!

01:48.640 --> 01:50.961
TAZA: Listen,
nobody wants war.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.329
But sometimes
we don't have a choice.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.677
MAN: We have a choice.

01:53.710 --> 01:55.632
This isn't our war.
It's theirs.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.444
TAZA: Pecas has us living
hand-to-mouth.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.573
Now, these people
are offering us a partnership.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.178
When they take over
Phoenix,

02:02.220 --> 02:03.949
we'll have better terms,

02:03.990 --> 02:06.481
finally be able to build
the new schools and clinics.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.987
And what good are
those new schools and clinics

02:08.020 --> 02:09.453
if our children
are slaughtered?

02:09.490 --> 02:11.629
With the Comisin,
we have peace.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.525
-No bloodshed.
MAN: He's right.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.152
BOTH: This is bullshit.
WOMAN: You guys aren't seeing

02:15.200 --> 02:16.758
wider than this picture.
We have to get out there!

02:16.800 --> 02:19.439
(overlapping shouting)
We can't even trust them!

02:19.470 --> 02:21.495
I think it's time
for us to go.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.802
(shouting continues)

02:22.840 --> 02:25.161
MAN: He's right!
-Just a second.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.178
WOMAN: We deserve more
than you can even Imagine.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.871
I would like to speak
to them.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.673
WOMAN: Don't tell us that.
You need to shut up.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.541
Please.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.117
WOMAN: What they're offering
we can have for our children.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.811
Hey, everyone, listen up.
Listen up.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.112
Hey!

02:38.150 --> 02:40.618
Our guest has something to say.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.619
*

02:44.660 --> 02:48.699
Like you, I got
into this business to survive.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.561
I thought ifI played
by the rules,

02:51.600 --> 02:52.931
I'd be okay.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.162
It doesn't work that way.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.535
We must decide
where to draw the line.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.208
Easy for you to say when we're
the ones doing the fighting--

03:02.250 --> 03:03.239
and dying.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.747
(affirmative chatter)

03:04.780 --> 03:06.372
TERESA: If we do this right,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.479
there won't be any dying.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.987
TAZA: Pecas isn't
gonna hand you

03:10.020 --> 03:11.942
the keys to the corridor
without a fight.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.250
He won't have a choice.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.985
We'll cut off
the Comisin's supply

03:16.020 --> 03:18.352
through your reservation
at the border crossing,

03:18.390 --> 03:20.551
and we'll smuggle the product
to Phoenix,

03:20.600 --> 03:22.591
where I'll be
the only supplier in town.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.160
They will be forced
to do business on our terms.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.532
Camila has a load
coming through this morning.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.407
If we prevent her from passing,

03:32.440 --> 03:33.907
she'll know we're allied.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.202
There'll be retribution.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.504
My smuggler's already
on his way.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.417
By the time Camila
figures out what happened,

03:40.450 --> 03:41.872
a deal will have been made.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.684
And if the Comisin refuses...

03:44.720 --> 03:45.948
I'm exposed.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.355
It will mean war.

03:47.390 --> 03:48.812
I know it's a risk.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.955
But if we do this,

03:51.990 --> 03:54.595
together we can win.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.291
We will run Phoenix.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.864
This is the third time
I call him.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.105
Well, you tell the general
that the governor of Sinaloa

04:06.140 --> 04:07.903
wants to speak with him
immediately.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.771
(door opens, phone slams)

04:09.810 --> 04:11.949
(door closes)

04:12.750 --> 04:13.819
Isabela.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.447
What's wrong?

04:17.490 --> 04:19.754
Mom, Kique's missing.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.758
He hasn't answered his phone,
and no one has seen him.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.821
Well, he's--he's probably
with his father.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.896
He wouldn't leave
wrthout telling me.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.421
We were supposed to meet up,
and he didn't show.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.392
I-I know something bad
has happened.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.431
-I can feel it.
-Isabela.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.169
I will do everything
within my power to find him.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.507
Okay?

04:44.710 --> 04:46.712
I know you will, mami.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.778
TERESA: Camila's truck
should be along any minute.

04:57.390 --> 05:00.325
I know you're still pissed
about what happened yesterday.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.191
I'm not angry.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.763
When you worked for Epifanio,

05:06.800 --> 05:08.768
did you ever disagree
with an order?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.301
Of course.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.002
But you never locked him
in a cellar.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.870
You would never disrespect
a man like that.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.447
I had no choice.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.778
You were not eating
or sleeping.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.981
You were acting crazy.
You wouldn't listen to anyone.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.885
I wouldn't listen to James.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.289
You're different.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.823
Our relationship is different.

05:33.260 --> 05:36.468
-If you'd have been honest--
-I tried.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.524
No.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.969
You tricked me.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.730
Then you did what you thought
was best.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.601
You're my friend, Pote.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.879
You're right.

05:49.910 --> 05:52.049
And I'm sorry.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.173
I promise it will
never happen again.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.246
We can never hide the truth
from each other.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.042
I made a mistake.

05:59.090 --> 06:02.059
But please,
don't question my loyalty.

06:02.090 --> 06:04.752
'Cause I live and die
with you, Teresita.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.657
We're family.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.021
We live and die
with each other.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.096
(radio crackles)

06:13.140 --> 06:14.368
Heads up.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.231
(vehicle approaching)

06:16.270 --> 06:19.068
(suspenseful music)

06:19.110 --> 06:21.169
Camila's truck.

06:21.210 --> 06:24.179
-Right on time.
POTE: [chuckles]

06:24.210 --> 06:27.577
Welcome to the United Cartels
of America, pendejos.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.417
(line trilling)

06:29.450 --> 06:31.338
OPERATOR: Homeland Security.
How may I direct your call?

06:31.390 --> 06:33.210
TERESA: There's a black
cargo truck filled with cocaine

06:33.260 --> 06:36.058
heading north
to the 10 freeway.

06:36.090 --> 06:37.921
Arizona license plate

06:37.960 --> 06:41.851
QVG 2108.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.119
*

06:45.170 --> 06:47.798
(phone ringing)

06:53.580 --> 06:55.275
Please tell me you found her.

06:55.310 --> 06:57.141
No.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.579
We have another problem.

06:58.610 --> 07:01.249
Our shipment was busted
an hour ago

07:01.280 --> 07:02.747
by Homeland Security.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.486
-Where?
PECAS: Just south of Phoenix.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.614
You understand the_ situation
this puts us In.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.424
When I agreed to an alliance,
assurances were made.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.588
Yeah.
On both sides.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.764
You assured me you would
take care of Teresa.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.062
You failed.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.931
And this is the result.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.564
You're suggesting Teresa had
something to do with this?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.238
Oh, yeah.
It's her.

07:26.270 --> 07:27.999
The only question is...

07:29.510 --> 07:32.377
Which one of your
Comisin members helped her?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.276
That's a serious accusation.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.084
Someone tipped her
to the shipment.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.008
You control
the Phoenix corridor.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.210
Therefore you're responsible.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.951
I still expect to be paid--

07:45.990 --> 07:47.799
on time

07:47.830 --> 07:50.298
and not a dollar short.

07:51.230 --> 07:54.461
It sounds like we have
a mutual enemy.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.708
You got any idea
who tipped her?

07:57.740 --> 07:59.537
Taza.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.832
The Indian?

08:01.880 --> 08:04.007
Teresa reached out to him.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.938
He must have taken the bait.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.447
Huh.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.368
Well, that figures.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.388
He's with her now.

08:11.420 --> 08:15.288
Helping the bitch
that put a bullet in your back

08:15.320 --> 08:17.185
and left you for dead.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.788
(sighs)

08:18.830 --> 08:20.297
Yeah, well, he's a...

08:20.330 --> 08:22.389
good-looking son of a bitch,
that Indian.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.195
Might be kind of triclq
to go after him, though.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.505
He's got hisself a stronghold
out there on that reservation.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.428
He can't hide forever.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.031
He'll have to stick
his head out eventually,

08:36.080 --> 08:38.878
and you can put a bullet
in it--

08:38.910 --> 08:40.343
him and Teresa.

08:40.380 --> 08:41.813
It's a shame

08:41.850 --> 08:45.183
Teresa didn't run
when she had the chance.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.780
She likes the desert so much.

08:49.290 --> 08:51.554
Now I'm gonna have
to bury her in it.

08:55.930 --> 08:58.319
Her and her damn Indian.

08:58.370 --> 09:04.832
*

09:04.870 --> 09:07.907
(children shouting playfully)

09:22.460 --> 09:24.280
No problems in Mexico.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.854
It was clear all the way
from the port.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.152
Okay, good.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.865
-What's up with her?
-Wine cellar.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.561
She's still upset about that?

09:33.600 --> 09:34.737
What do you think?

09:34.770 --> 09:36.362
TERESA: How was the trip?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.630
Ah, G.I. James led us
on a circuitous route,

09:38.670 --> 09:40.274
but we got here in one piece.

09:40.310 --> 09:41.868
We got the coke
over the border.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.071
Now all we got to do
is get it to Phoenix.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.947
Bazookas and blow.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.610
Oh.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.478
-That's a MK19.
-Mm-hmm.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.422
Goddamn,
that's some serious shit.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.927
We do this right,

09:59.960 --> 10:01.518
we won't need weapons.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.963
You like weapons.
Come on, now.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.828
(speaking Spanish)

10:20.850 --> 10:23.318
(tense music)

10:23.350 --> 10:27.514
*

10:31.130 --> 10:33.155
*

10:33.200 --> 10:35.452
That was Charger.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.196
He just spotted Mayo
leaving Pecas' restaurant.

10:38.230 --> 10:40.198
POTE: The pinche sheriff?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.468
I thought he was
on life support.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.104
Yeah, not anymore.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.767
He's injured,
but he's back on the job.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.300
So it's not just La Comisin

10:46.340 --> 10:47.978
we have to worry about now.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.534
Mayo will be coming
for us, too.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.275
JAMES: He'll have eyes
on the highway.

10:51.310 --> 10:53.972
TAZA: The minute we leave
the res, we're exposed.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.443
We can avoid him
by sticking to the back roads.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.788
He'll never see us.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.378
Our best shot is
this old smuggling route

10:59.420 --> 11:01.308
called Devil's Highway.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.487
It's the long way,
but it gets our product

11:03.530 --> 11:05.851
-to the Phoenix market.
-That's 200 miles of badlands.

11:05.890 --> 11:07.790
I mean, we could be ambushed
anywhere along that route.

11:07.830 --> 11:11.459
TAZA: Yeah, but it avoids
Mayo's checkpoints along 118.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.798
I mean,
if we're rolling the dice,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.489
this is our best shot.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.038
What do you think, George?

11:19.370 --> 11:22.498
If we were in water,
I'd want a fast boat.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.405
Same rule applies here.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.803
If we're gonna kamikaze
this bitch--

11:25.850 --> 11:27.249
JAMES: We need good cars.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.372
Fast as we can get.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.684
I got just what we need.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.689
(dramatic music)

11:34.720 --> 11:41.558
*

11:58.280 --> 12:01.078
So all the cars are
"borrowed."

12:01.120 --> 12:03.839
We trick 'em out and ship 'em
to buyers overseas.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.687
Mostly Japanese.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.688
Police will see us coming
a mile away.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.278
TAZA: Oh, that's the point.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.925
Smugglers use shitty cars
in case they're seized.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.894
Cops will never suspect
one of these.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.352
Smuggling in plain sight.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.549
We'll need a rabbit car.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.795
TAZA: The legendary LS6.

12:18.830 --> 12:22.038
Multiple police scanners
and radar detectors.

12:22.070 --> 12:25.301
Since you know the route,
you and Pote can take the lead.

12:25.340 --> 12:27.399
If the sheriff or his friends
are lying in wait...

12:27.440 --> 12:29.977
-(laughing)
TAZA: We'll flush 'em out,

12:30.010 --> 12:31.773
get 'em to chase us down
a rabbit trail.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.469
We'll clear the path
for the transport vehicle.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.886
We need something different
to move the product.

12:38.920 --> 12:39.909
We call her the Beast.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.951
460 under the hood,

12:41.990 --> 12:44.129
racing shocks,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.924
and a Bull Bumperjust in case.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.894
Whoo!

12:49.930 --> 12:51.966
You and Bilal
will be on transpo.

12:52.000 --> 12:52.932
(metal music blaring on radio)

12:52.970 --> 12:55.336
(howling to the music)

12:55.370 --> 12:57.838
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.501
Stay ten miles
behind the rabbit car

13:00.540 --> 13:01.802
so you can react
if there's any trouble.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.172
Got ya.
Who's got our tail?

13:04.210 --> 13:06.678
-We do.
-We'll be in the chase car.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.268
TAZA: You got something
in mind?

13:10.150 --> 13:12.584
-That one.
-Ooh, no, no, no.

13:12.620 --> 13:13.951
She's special.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.481
750 horses under the hood

13:16.520 --> 13:18.784
_ and a dual
nitrous oxrde system.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.128
GEORGE: Fast enough
to set your hair on fire.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.422
(engine rewing)

13:22.460 --> 13:23.961
She'll do.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.160
JAMES: We'll be
about a mile behind

13:25.200 --> 13:26.622
for rear security.

13:28.870 --> 13:31.100
If anyone wants to back out,

13:31.140 --> 13:32.539
now is the time.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.437
(dramatic music)

13:35.480 --> 13:39.143
*

13:39.180 --> 13:40.670
We go at sundown.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.983
CORTEZ: (speaking Spanish)

13:46.690 --> 13:48.214
I need to talk to you.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.584
Now.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.026
Governor,
I wasn't expecting you.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.834
I've been trying to get
ahold of you for hours.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.803
Did you hear
about our lost shipment?

14:05.840 --> 14:08.206
That's what this meeting
was about.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.605
I've already taken measures.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.240
There's a breach
of our security.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.975
I wanted answers immediately.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.908
And what did you find out?

14:15.950 --> 14:18.214
Authorities were tipped off
at 10:30.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.013
According to our GPS tracker,

14:20.060 --> 14:24.087
our truck entered Taza's
reservation at that time.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.451
Then Taza is a traitor
in the Comisin.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.690
Teresa wants to dry out
the supply in Phoenix

14:31.730 --> 14:33.891
so she can move her product in.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.567
I sent soldiers to Sonora,

14:35.600 --> 14:37.158
and Pecas has already
been notified.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.404
(tense music)

14:38.440 --> 14:40.431
You spoke with Pecas?

14:41.610 --> 14:43.703
CORTEZ: If we're going
to stop Teresa...

14:44.950 --> 14:46.577
(recorder beeps)

14:46.610 --> 14:49.317
Expedience is key.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.911
Is there anything else,
Governor?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.951
Kique.

14:55.990 --> 14:59.027
I need you to release him
immediately.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.857
That's going to be a problem.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.299
We don't have him.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.592
He never showed up
to his meeting

15:03.630 --> 15:04.858
with Isabela last night.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.390
My men waited for hours.

15:06.430 --> 15:09.160
Kique may have gone
into hiding with Boaz.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.901
It's possible

15:14.940 --> 15:17.977
that he got wind of our plan
to kidnap him

15:18.010 --> 15:19.807
and fled.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.317
You assured me...

15:22.850 --> 15:26.047
Isabela would never know
I gave the order.

15:26.090 --> 15:29.685
Your secret is safe, Governor.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.988
With you.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.663
(engine rewing)

15:39.700 --> 15:41.588
We just hit the 100-mile mark.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.336
No sign of Mayo
or any other police.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.930
Hope our luck holds. We got
to get that load to Phoenix.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.902
This is the rabbit car.

15:48.940 --> 15:50.840
POTE (over radio):
Halfway to our rally point.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.245
All clear.
(metal music playing on radio)

15:52.280 --> 15:53.247
Copy.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.918
We're five mikes behind you.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.747
How you lookin' in the rear?

15:56.780 --> 15:58.338
Yeah, we're all clear.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.641
*

15:59.690 --> 16:02.682
(engine rewing)

16:07.960 --> 16:11.464
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

16:13.240 --> 16:14.832
MAYO: Put that down!

16:14.870 --> 16:16.030
That's the rabbit car.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.334
They'll be running
radar detectors.

16:20.510 --> 16:23.968
These fools think
they're so damn clever.

16:24.010 --> 16:25.648
The transpo vehicle
will be next.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.874
Let's get into place.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.973
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

16:30.020 --> 16:32.511
Looks like your tip's
about to pay off, big man.

16:32.550 --> 16:33.551
(gun cocks)

16:33.590 --> 16:35.057
How you feel about that?

16:37.090 --> 16:38.523
You gave me your word.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.494
When this is all over,

16:41.530 --> 16:43.691
no retribution
against my tribe.

16:43.730 --> 16:44.822
Yeah.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.830
I don't know what it is
about you people.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.734
You never learn.

16:51.770 --> 16:52.702
(gunshot)

16:52.740 --> 16:54.901
(engine rewing)

16:57.280 --> 16:59.646
Hey, look, about yesterday,

16:59.680 --> 17:01.409
What I did...

17:01.450 --> 17:03.714
You did it to protect me.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.508
-Exactly.
-And because we slept together,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.687
you thought it gave you
the right to do that.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.220
That was wrong.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.688
So you regret what we did?

17:15.730 --> 17:16.992
No.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.258
Of course not.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.393
But you can't just
make decisions for me.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.964
Something had to be done.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.338
What went down
In Mexrco...

17:26.370 --> 17:29.669
Guero's death,
you need to deal with that.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.372
What I need is for you
to respect me.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.116
I know you're worried
about me,

17:34.150 --> 17:35.708
but I'm okay.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.115
(radio beeps)

17:37.150 --> 17:38.617
POTE: The cop let us through.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.413
Something's up.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.882
We got trouble.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.285
TERESA (over radio):
What's happening?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.753
-It's a roadblock.
-Shit.

17:45.790 --> 17:48.293
JAMES (over radio): How the
hell did he know where we were?

17:48.330 --> 17:55.338
*

17:56.440 --> 17:59.136
MAN: Keep your hands up!
Don't move!

18:00.610 --> 18:02.703
Look alive.

18:02.740 --> 18:05.345
MAYO (over radio): Kill your
motor and show me your hands!

18:06.580 --> 18:08.070
Slow.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.213
TERESA (over radio):
George is in trouble.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.740
MAN: Keep 'em
where we can see 'em!

18:11.790 --> 18:14.156
Now, you be careful.
These boys...

18:15.260 --> 18:16.613
Their blood's up.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.325
He needs us.
Move In!

18:19.360 --> 18:20.725
(engine rewing)

18:20.760 --> 18:22.125
TAZA: They're ten miles back.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.025
Turn around.
Turn around!

18:25.500 --> 18:28.094
(tires squealing)

18:28.140 --> 18:32.429
*

18:37.210 --> 18:40.646
Okeydoke,
hands behind your head.

18:44.190 --> 18:48.354
Now, I'm guessing you're not
from around here.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.382
Who's your girlfriend?

18:54.130 --> 18:55.825
(chuckles)

18:59.470 --> 19:01.688
What tribe you from,
sweetheart?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.638
Don't be shy.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.205
Does your mama know

19:08.240 --> 19:09.901
that you're friends with him?

19:11.980 --> 19:13.242
I bet she don't.

19:15.050 --> 19:18.508
I bet you keep that
on the down low, don't you?

19:18.550 --> 19:20.780
Now, I asked you a question,
you son of a bitch!

19:20.820 --> 19:23.482
(engine rewing)

19:23.530 --> 19:25.452
(tires screeching)
-Incoming.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.720
(indistinct shouting, gunfire)
MAN: Take cover!

19:27.760 --> 19:29.352

Son of a bitch!

Get out of here!

20:01.460 --> 20:03.860
(indistinct shouting)

20:13.280 --> 20:15.737
Pull over! _
You're gonna get us killed.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.078
We can't lose the load.
We need this.

20:18.110 --> 20:19.668
We can't let them catch us.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.541
If you don't pull over,
we're gonna lose it.

loaded and stat!

20:57.690 --> 20:59.612
-We lost them!
-Not for long.

Teresa, go! Go!

JAMES:
There's more in the van!

21:16.870 --> 21:18.735
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.328
Teresa!

21:46.400 --> 21:48.197
Let's unload it
and get a count.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.639
We need to know what we lost.

21:49.670 --> 21:51.137
GEORGE: We did it, Principessa.

21:51.170 --> 21:53.309
Now you're the only supplier
in town.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.376
-Not yet.
LIL T: Holy shit.

21:55.410 --> 21:56.604
Looks like you guys
went to hell and back.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.278
We did.
Are you ready?

21:58.310 --> 21:59.379
(zipper opens)

22:00.650 --> 22:02.413
You sure you can handle this?

22:03.250 --> 22:05.844
We at war. Everybody's got to
put in work. You know I'm down.

22:05.890 --> 22:07.551
TERESA: You'll take it
to Pecas.

22:07.590 --> 22:08.955
It's a risk, but we have
to show him

22:08.990 --> 22:11.185
that we have
the only product In town.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.119
Tonto's going with you, okay?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.229
Be careful.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.695

man speaking Spanish)

22:22.340 --> 22:23.329
Isabela.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.298
What a nice surprise.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.671
I'm here alone.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.371
Please...

22:32.410 --> 22:33.968
have a seat.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.511
No, thank you.
I'll stand.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.088
(door closes)

22:43.590 --> 22:44.750
Tell me,

22:44.790 --> 22:46.655
what can I do for you?

22:46.690 --> 22:49.557
I want to know what happened
to Kique.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.965
I know you know.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.462
Did my mother...

22:54.740 --> 22:56.537
Have you do something to him?

23:29.940 --> 23:31.669
Are you sure you want to know?

23:40.780 --> 23:42.077
(recorder beeps)

23:43.020 --> 23:44.783
CAMILA (over recorder):
You assured me Isabela

23:44.820 --> 23:46.845
would never know
I gave the order.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.450
(recorder beeps)

23:52.490 --> 23:56.153
You assured me Isabela would
never know I gave the order.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.761
(breathing unevenly)

23:59.800 --> 24:01.529
I-I don't...

24:05.270 --> 24:06.931
I don't understand.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.341
She blames you
for Teresa's escape.

24:12.380 --> 24:14.940
She can't get past her anger.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.814
Her thirst for revenge
is unquenchable.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.179
I'm sorry.

24:25.830 --> 24:28.799
You're betraying my mother
by telling me.

24:29.830 --> 24:30.899
Why?

24:32.030 --> 24:35.864
I know you think me a monster.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.209
But even monsters have codes.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.609
Your mother:-
she crossed a line.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.473
Kique was an innocent.

24:45.510 --> 24:46.943
And so are you.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.949
(solemn music)

24:49.980 --> 24:55.111
*

24:55.160 --> 24:57.788
(dark music)

24:57.830 --> 24:59.786
I want to see his body.

24:59.830 --> 25:02.526
*

25:07.070 --> 25:09.595
(insects chirping)

25:16.410 --> 25:18.071
(whispering inaudibly)

25:21.120 --> 25:25.045
So the rumors
about your product are true.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.718
99% pure Bolivian.

25:28.890 --> 25:32.189
-Boom.
-(laughs)

25:32.230 --> 25:33.993
I like you.

25:34.030 --> 25:36.419
But I don't like
being cornered.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.534
What's the count?

25:41.570 --> 25:43.367
We lost 87 kilos.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.936
GEORGE: That's not bad,
considering the fact

25:44.970 --> 25:46.562
we started with a metric ton.

25:46.610 --> 25:49.170
Add a little baking soda,
and voil.

25:49.210 --> 25:50.404
Problem solved.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.670
We don't cut our coke.

25:52.710 --> 25:53.916
I'll take the loss.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.269
(sighs)

25:55.320 --> 25:57.447
(cell phone buzzing)

25:57.480 --> 25:58.515
It's him.

25:58.550 --> 25:59.983
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.387
TERESA: You got my message.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.386
Your product is good, but...

26:06.430 --> 26:08.091
that doesn't make me a buyer.

26:08.130 --> 26:10.553
It does if you want
to stay in business.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.296
You tell Taza
when I'm through with him--

26:13.330 --> 26:15.366
You hurt him or his people,

26:15.400 --> 26:17.630
you'll never touch a gram
of my product.

26:18.510 --> 26:19.966
What are your terms?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.299
I supply you exclusively.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.740
Better product.
Cheaper prices.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.611
Everyone makes more money.

26:28.450 --> 26:31.715
I'll need approval
from the rest of La Comisin.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.650
You have 24 hours.

26:33.690 --> 26:36.488
(tense music)

26:36.520 --> 26:38.158
*

26:38.190 --> 26:40.488
All right.
Now we wait.

26:40.530 --> 26:41.997
-No.
-No.

26:42.030 --> 26:43.122
We move forward.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.060
By this time tomorrow,

26:45.100 --> 26:46.795
we'll either need
more product...

26:47.870 --> 26:49.633
Or more guns.

26:54.310 --> 26:56.232
(James groans)

26:56.280 --> 26:57.599
You okay?

26:58.480 --> 26:59.469
Yeah.

27:01.650 --> 27:03.618
You know,
respect goes both ways.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.018
You're right.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.317
I know you're trying
to help me.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.695
I don't know
how to trust people.

27:18.130 --> 27:21.964
So, when people
make decisions for me,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.536
I don't know how to handle it.

27:25.470 --> 27:27.006
I don't feel safe.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.171
This is who I am.

27:32.210 --> 27:34.110
JAMES: I know.

27:34.150 --> 27:36.448
But you don't have to hide
from me.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.380
TERESA: Okay, I won't.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.982
Teresa.

27:43.190 --> 27:46.159
Something's come up.

27:46.190 --> 27:47.555
We got to go.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.192
(suspenseful music)

27:53.230 --> 28:00.204
*

28:06.210 --> 28:07.370
This way.

28:12.050 --> 28:13.347
TERESA: Thank you.

28:13.390 --> 28:16.359
(monitor beeping)

28:16.390 --> 28:22.898
*

28:24.470 --> 28:27.394
TAZA: Pecas. My people saw
his men dumping them.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.469
They were bubble wrapped.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.077
What about Lil T?

28:40.250 --> 28:44.448
*

28:44.490 --> 28:47.482
(monitor continues beeping)

28:50.830 --> 28:52.559
TAZA: She's alive,

28:52.590 --> 28:55.821
but sons of bitches branded her
like a damn animal.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.399
(music intensifies)

29:01.440 --> 29:08.334
*

29:15.280 --> 29:16.770
How is she?

29:16.820 --> 29:17.912
Alive.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.488
Barely.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.579
She's just a kid.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.929
JAMES: She knew
what she was getting into.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.485
-It's not your fault.
-Yeah, it is.

29:27.530 --> 29:30.727
I was wrong to think we could
do this without bloodshed.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.625
So we go to war, then.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.593
We've got Pecas in the north,
Camila to the south.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.664
We can't win.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.909
There is a way.

29:41.940 --> 29:43.805
We have to make a deal
with Mayo.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.907
It won't be forever.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.975
You don't get into bed
with a man like Mayo

29:49.020 --> 29:50.317
and then just walk away.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.341
(Pote speaking Spanish)

29:52.390 --> 29:54.517
I don't like it
any more than you do.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.449
Pero like it or not...

29:58.460 --> 30:00.348
It's a damn good strategy.

30:00.390 --> 30:01.755
I crippled the guy
with a bullet.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.449
You think he's just gonna
forget that?

30:03.500 --> 30:05.491
We'll pay him to forget.

30:07.300 --> 30:08.858
You once told me

30:08.900 --> 30:11.505
you have to do business
with corrupt people.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.972
But this...

30:15.010 --> 30:16.807
is where I stand and fight.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.847
This is where it ends.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.609
It never ends.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.538
I know where this is going.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.639
Then you know
what has to be done.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.823
(cell phone buzzes)

30:32.860 --> 30:34.498
You miss me already, baby girl?

30:34.530 --> 30:36.350
TERESA (over phone):
Where are you?

30:36.400 --> 30:38.322
GEORGE (over phone):
About an hour outside Guaymas.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.122
We would've been making
better time, but...

30:40.170 --> 30:42.138
Bilal was convinced
there was a donkey show

30:42.170 --> 30:44.229
-in Rio Muerto.
-(laughs)

30:44.270 --> 30:45.965
There is not.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.874
You don't sound happy.
What's up?

30:50.510 --> 30:52.899
La Comisin rejected the offer.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.179
(sighs)

30:56.220 --> 30:57.369
Listen.

30:58.350 --> 31:01.148
Whatever happens,
you know I got your back.

31:01.190 --> 31:02.418
Whatever you need.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.087
I'll be in touch.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.648
It's gonna get bloody.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.565
BILAL: My king!
(guns cock)

31:13.700 --> 31:15.736
Hey, hey, hey.

31:15.770 --> 31:18.364
Now, how much dinero
is it gonna cost me

31:18.410 --> 31:19.832
for me and my amigo--

31:19.870 --> 31:21.269
(YEIPS)

31:21.310 --> 31:23.608
-(groans)
-You mother--

31:23.640 --> 31:26.108
Mother--
(both grunting)

31:26.150 --> 31:29.119
(tense music)

31:29.150 --> 31:35.555
*

31:36.790 --> 31:38.348
(screams) Bilal!

31:38.390 --> 31:39.880
(grunting)
That's all you got?

31:39.930 --> 31:41.124
That's all you got?

31:45.830 --> 31:48.697
(door sliding)

31:48.740 --> 31:51.732
(insects chirping)

32:03.850 --> 32:06.785
(dramatic music)

32:06.820 --> 32:13.589
*

32:24.940 --> 32:25.964
(gasps softly)

32:28.210 --> 32:29.199
(gasps)

32:33.380 --> 32:39.944
*

33:05.210 --> 33:07.474
(retching)

33:09.080 --> 33:12.345
*

33:12.390 --> 33:13.846
(breathing heavily)

33:15.860 --> 33:18.226
(crying)

33:20.230 --> 33:21.458
(grunts)

33:21.500 --> 33:24.992
(sobbing)

33:33.210 --> 33:34.404
(sniffles)

33:35.580 --> 33:37.138
Did he suffer?

33:37.180 --> 33:39.273
I am certain
It was qUICk.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.417
I'll bury him tomorrow.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.079
No.

33:49.290 --> 33:50.552
No.

33:52.890 --> 33:54.619
I'm gonna make my mother pay.

33:59.930 --> 34:02.091
I'm busy.
Make it quick.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.028
We've captured King George.

34:04.070 --> 34:07.369
(indistinct chatter)

34:07.970 --> 34:09.574
Was he carrying product?

34:09.610 --> 34:11.942
No, he was heading south.

34:11.980 --> 34:13.208
Then he must have
already delivered

34:13.250 --> 34:14.911
his shipment to Teresa.

34:14.950 --> 34:17.578
CORTEZ (over phone):
Yes, but it will be his last.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.612
He was carrying a manifest
for a ship clocked in Guaymas.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.379
We've seized it.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.489
What is this?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.525
What are these soldiers
dorng here?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.118
CORTEZ (over phone):
They're there to protect you.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.798
I don't need protection.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.024
CORTEZ (over phone):
I'm afraid you do.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.925
You see,

34:32.970 --> 34:34.961
we're at war now.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.389
I need to keep an eye.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.465
For your protection.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.983
(tense music)

34:52.020 --> 34:55.183
*

35:00.460 --> 35:03.452
(insects chirping)

35:07.600 --> 35:08.828
(silenced gunshot)

35:11.440 --> 35:15.103
(dramatic music)

35:15.140 --> 35:17.108
(muffled groan)

35:17.140 --> 35:24.148
*

35:34.700 --> 35:36.850
Go on.
Get it done.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.825
Do it, you son of a bitch.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.360
TERESA: We're not here
to kill you.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.606
What is this?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.868
The amount we agreed
to pay you,

35:54.920 --> 35:57.480
plus 10% for pain
and suffering.

36:06.490 --> 36:08.629
You're going after Pecas.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.150
Do we have a deal?

36:10.200 --> 36:12.065
MAYO: I don't know.

36:12.100 --> 36:16.491
Pecas and his boys pay me
a pretty penny for my services.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.667
And your boy shot me.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.008
We'll match
what they're paying you.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.632
On top of our fee.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.671
Well, that's food for thought.

36:24.710 --> 36:26.246
(gun cocks)

36:26.280 --> 36:27.872
You know how this works.

36:27.910 --> 36:29.514
(gun cocks)

36:30.120 --> 36:31.439
What the hell?

36:33.050 --> 36:35.450
I got no allegiance to Pecas.

36:37.690 --> 36:39.726
You hold up your end
of the bargain,

36:39.760 --> 36:41.557
I'll hold up mine.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.364
Don't even think
of betraying me.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.837
The video of you beating
that inmate will go viral.

36:48.870 --> 36:51.065
You will be locked up
with a lot of people

36:51.100 --> 36:54.206
who'd like to do the same
to you and worse.

36:55.910 --> 36:57.434
Do you understand?

36:59.280 --> 37:00.872
Mm.

37:00.910 --> 37:07.918
*

37:17.000 --> 37:18.729
No turning back now.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.272
(door opens)

37:29.310 --> 37:32.302
(monitor beeping)

37:39.620 --> 37:41.247
Teresa.

37:41.290 --> 37:43.053
I thought you might want
to rest.

37:43.090 --> 37:44.751
I can stay with her
if you want.

37:44.790 --> 37:45.927
No.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.029
It's okay.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.651
I want to be here
if she wakes up.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.296
Okay, then.

37:53.330 --> 37:54.968
Wait.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.331
There's something else.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.167
What is it?

38:00.440 --> 38:02.635
It's nothing.
It can wait.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.136
No.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.670
Tell me.

38:17.220 --> 38:20.121
(breathes deeply)

38:20.160 --> 38:21.752
Is there something going on

38:21.800 --> 38:24.018
between you and James
that I should know?

38:24.060 --> 38:27.029
(solemn music)

38:27.070 --> 38:29.868
*

38:29.900 --> 38:31.436
How long?

38:35.740 --> 38:37.537
You told me

38:37.580 --> 38:40.174
that we cannot keep
the truth from each other.

38:40.210 --> 38:43.213
But you've been keeping
a big truth from me.

38:44.920 --> 38:48.686
Who you lay with
is your business.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.825
But this affects me, too.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.396
Are you saying this
because I kept it from you...

38:58.930 --> 39:00.818
Or because it's James?

39:00.870 --> 39:05.068
I'm saying this
because it's dangerous.

39:07.610 --> 39:09.237
For all of us.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.371
You're right.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.342
It's a risk.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.510
What do you think about James?

39:23.620 --> 39:25.326
Truth.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.021
Truth?

39:29.760 --> 39:31.728
He will die for you.

39:31.770 --> 39:38.767
*

39:41.410 --> 39:43.537
I'm here for you, Teresita.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.402
Thank you.

39:47.450 --> 39:52.240
*

39:52.290 --> 39:56.408
(door opens, closes)

39:56.460 --> 40:01.454
*

40:04.970 --> 40:06.619
(LP's "Muddy Waters")

40:06.670 --> 40:08.888
(cell phone buzzing)

40:08.940 --> 40:11.636
(men vocalizing)

40:11.670 --> 40:12.807
You find him?

40:12.840 --> 40:13.966
*

40:14.010 --> 40:15.705
I can't get a shot on Pecas.

40:15.740 --> 40:18.038
But he's with Bedoya.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.072
You were right.
They're circling the wagons.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.374
What do you want me to do?

40:23.420 --> 40:25.047
LP:
* All the steps to follow

40:25.090 --> 40:27.388
* Closer right behind

40:27.420 --> 40:31.208
* Is it only when you feel
a part is empty *

40:31.260 --> 40:34.286
* That it's gnawing
at the corners of your mind *

40:34.330 --> 40:35.627
* (echoing) Mind, mind, mind

40:35.660 --> 40:38.299
* Ooh, I will ask you

40:38.330 --> 40:40.594
* For mercy

40:40.630 --> 40:44.464
-* I will come to you blind
MEN: * Ooh

40:44.510 --> 40:47.229
LP: * What you'll see
is the worst me *

40:47.270 --> 40:48.828
MEN: * Oh

40:48.880 --> 40:51.075
LP: * Not the last
of my kind *

40:51.110 --> 40:54.773
* Oh, oh, oh

40:54.820 --> 40:58.688
* In the muddy water,
we're falling *

40:58.720 --> 41:02.486
* Oh, oh, oh

41:02.520 --> 41:06.320
* In the muddy water,
we're crawling *

41:06.360 --> 41:10.023
* Holds me down

41:10.060 --> 41:13.928
* Hold me now

41:13.970 --> 41:17.758
* Sold me out

41:17.800 --> 41:21.702
* In the muddy waters,
we're falling *

41:21.740 --> 41:23.276
*

41:23.310 --> 41:25.039
JAMES:
What am I doing, Teresa?

41:27.750 --> 41:29.217
TERESA (over phone): No.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.718
If you don't have
a clean shot of Pecas,

41:31.750 --> 41:33.786
we wait.

41:33.820 --> 41:36.288
When the time is right,
we'll kill them all.

41:36.320 --> 41:40.882
LP: * Hold me now

41:40.930 --> 41:44.661
* Sold me out

41:44.700 --> 41:48.329
* In the muddy water,
we're falling *

41:54.110 --> 41:57.079
(dramatic electronic music)

41:57.110 --> 42:04.118
*
