WEBVTT

00:11.479 --> 00:14.482
(light synth music)

00:16.917 --> 00:20.154
(eerie ambient music)

00:21.422 --> 00:22.256
- [Vinny] Tensions were rising

00:22.256 --> 00:23.924
in the mobs of Little Italy,

00:23.924 --> 00:25.793
Brooklyn, and Chinatown.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.262
They tried working togethe,
but criminals can't be trust.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.163
- You wear that every day.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.098
Where'd you get that shit su?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.099
Look, who still dresses like
this?

00:31.099 --> 00:31.932
- Mind your business.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.267
- Do you see this guy?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.268
- I see him.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.836
- [Vinny] That's Al Capella,

00:35.836 --> 00:37.938
the real deal boss of Manhattan.

00:37.938 --> 00:40.774
Don't mess with him unless
you collect horse heads.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.477
This guy's Amadore Condimento.

00:43.477 --> 00:47.481
He's the boss of Brooklyn,
pedals in condiments.

00:47.481 --> 00:51.352
This is Chinatown's triad boss,
Hung Phat!

00:51.352 --> 00:54.288
He speaks English but when
he wants you to feel small,

00:54.288 --> 00:55.956
it's all Chinese.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.791
(wind whooshing)

00:58.192 --> 01:00.461
- [Sean] Gentlemen.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.031
- [Vinny] And then,
there is Sean O'Greedy,

01:04.031 --> 01:06.200
our Crime Commissioner on the
take.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.736
Everyone is corrupt in this
town.

01:08.736 --> 01:13.040
- A decade ago we moved
away from drugs and gambling

01:13.040 --> 01:17.077
to run oils, and spices, and
herbs.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.582
We are the original crime
syndicate.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.418
Begun centuries ago by Marco
Polo.

01:26.053 --> 01:30.391
We've made fortunes
selling addictive flavors,

01:30.391 --> 01:34.395
holding shops and restaurants
hostage,

01:34.395 --> 01:37.097
to bulk orders without
discounts.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.569
Your greed threatens everything.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.505
- Look, Capella's passed his
prime.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.777
He let the Chinese overtake
Mott and Mulberry Street.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.579
I'll run his territory.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.081
- This is coming from a guy
who's still stuck in the '70s.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.683
Look at that freaking outfit,
would you?

01:55.683 --> 01:56.784
Look at his men?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.419
- How dare you talk to me like
that?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.288
- You were nothin' but a
broken-down fight promoter

02:00.288 --> 02:01.955
'til I made you what you are.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.790
- Ha.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.624
- [Al] Sit down.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.692
- Sit down?

02:04.692 --> 02:05.526
- Sit down!

02:05.526 --> 02:06.360
(pounds desk)

02:06.360 --> 02:07.628
- Listen!

02:07.628 --> 02:11.865
I don't want your trouble
to get in my business!

02:11.865 --> 02:12.700
- Watch your mouth.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.967
Who the hell are you talking to?

02:13.967 --> 02:17.638
(speaking foreign language)

02:23.110 --> 02:25.946
(laughing)

02:25.946 --> 02:27.448
What did he just say?

02:27.448 --> 02:31.452
- My boss said, "Greed is
a powerful aphrodisiac.

02:31.452 --> 02:35.623
But when the feast is over,
no one cares about the sauce."

02:35.623 --> 02:36.624
- What does that mean?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.959
Nobody cares about the sauce?

02:38.959 --> 02:39.893
(speaking foreign language)

02:39.893 --> 02:41.128
(laughs)

02:41.128 --> 02:42.463
What does that mean?

02:42.463 --> 02:44.064
- It means "asshole".

02:44.064 --> 02:44.898
- No, I know what it means.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.066
North of Canal Street it means
man

02:46.066 --> 02:47.668
who talk too much get killed.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.069
Watch your ass.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.905
- Yeah, you sound like a
Chinese fortune cookie.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.806
(laughs)

02:52.806 --> 02:53.641
Am I right?

02:53.641 --> 02:54.508
Am I right?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.477
(laughs)

02:56.477 --> 02:58.646
- Forget about it.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.348
- Careful, boys.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.650
(gong crashing)

03:02.650 --> 03:03.751
- Who the hell is he?

03:03.751 --> 03:06.019
- [Al] Look at that
freaking outfit, would you?

03:06.019 --> 03:09.423
- Gentleman, this is Hai Chu.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.491
- [Vinny] Bless you.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.327
- He's head of the Chinese
family in Philly here

03:13.327 --> 03:14.995
to discuss business.

03:15.829 --> 03:16.697
- What is in it for him?

03:16.697 --> 03:20.334
(speaking foreign language)

03:20.334 --> 03:21.502
- We will see.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.372
- [Vinny] Back in the day,
Chu and Phat fell out.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.675
Something about a
gambling debt and a girl.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.010
That bracelet is a reminder.

03:32.846 --> 03:36.717
(suspenseful orchestral music)

03:40.521 --> 03:43.056
(both yelling)

03:50.130 --> 03:52.366
(grunting)

03:59.707 --> 04:01.875
(groaning)

04:05.045 --> 04:08.716
- Now, I am the boss in
Philadelphia!

04:08.716 --> 04:12.386
(dramatic orchestral music)

04:16.390 --> 04:18.392
- I'm up for re-election.

04:18.392 --> 04:22.396
So, you better steady your
relationships.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.565
If not, we are all ruined.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.737
The next commissioner
will dismantle everything!

04:33.073 --> 04:34.675
(chuckles)

04:34.675 --> 04:35.509
Power,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.747
that's what appeals to me.

04:40.748 --> 04:41.582
Power.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.285
- [Man] Hi-ya.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.956
(dramatic orchestral music)

04:53.427 --> 04:56.430
(upbeat jazz music)

05:02.936 --> 05:05.806
* I want to know

05:05.806 --> 05:09.042
* How I can start

05:09.042 --> 05:14.047
* When love has always torn my
heart *

05:14.615 --> 05:17.451
* But if I feel

05:17.451 --> 05:19.953
* The storm begin

05:19.953 --> 05:21.955
* My mind is of a fool's

05:21.955 --> 05:24.658
* And I rush in

05:24.658 --> 05:29.663
* To what I know will alwayse
*

05:30.731 --> 05:33.300
* A trip through pain

05:33.300 --> 05:36.904
* And ecstasy

05:36.904 --> 05:41.475
* When my blood begins to rae
*

05:41.475 --> 05:46.480
* My idle trepidations all erase
*

05:47.014 --> 05:52.019
* What if she's the one I sa*

05:54.021 --> 05:59.026
* How can I let her get away

05:59.827 --> 06:04.832
* I just can't go another day

06:05.332 --> 06:10.337
* Without her by my side to say
*

06:11.204 --> 06:14.041
* I want to know

06:14.041 --> 06:17.511
* If you could care

06:17.511 --> 06:21.849
* For one who always would be
there *

06:24.785 --> 06:27.455
- Do you know where
Wisdom and Knowledge are?

06:27.455 --> 06:31.124
(speaking foreign language)

06:33.026 --> 06:35.529
(flute music)

06:43.871 --> 06:46.540
- Yes, what is it that you are
seeking?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.876
- I seek advice from the
all-knowing Jade brothers.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.745
Tell me, sir, are you the
great sage, Knowledge?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.213
- I am Wisdom.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.882
That dummy there is Knowledge.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.849
(Knowledge scoffs)

06:55.849 --> 06:57.217
- Look, I could really use se
advice.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.519
- Ha!

06:58.519 --> 07:01.388
- Does the dragon make the rn
fall without first (inhale)

07:01.388 --> 07:05.559
breathing in the sweet
smells of the incense?

07:05.559 --> 07:09.763
- A little cha-ching, Wisdom
ain't cheap, you know?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.834
Hey, that's for my new hip!

07:13.834 --> 07:15.736
And when I get it I'll put my
foot

07:15.736 --> 07:17.237
where Confucius grace don't
shine!

07:17.237 --> 07:18.071
- Guys!

07:18.071 --> 07:19.940
A little focus.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.577
Look, today everybody in
the city thinks I am a hero.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.078
The girl of my dreams kissed me.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.246
And I am in love.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.683
- I knew I was good but I
never worked this fast before?

07:29.683 --> 07:32.352
- Widow Chang said, "You're o
fast."

07:32.352 --> 07:34.121
- That's not what your wife
said!

07:34.121 --> 07:35.422
She never had it so good!

07:35.422 --> 07:36.256
- Hah!

07:36.256 --> 07:37.090
Which wife?

07:37.090 --> 07:37.925
- All of them!

07:37.925 --> 07:39.927
- Guys, this is serious.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.629
(laughs)

07:41.629 --> 07:44.264
- How can you be so sure?

07:44.264 --> 07:47.801
- Look, it wasn't easy
growing up the eldest son.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.104
(all shouting and grunting)

07:51.104 --> 07:52.105
It was my duty to bring great
pride

07:52.105 --> 07:53.140
to my family.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.714
But I just couldn't measure .

08:00.714 --> 08:01.549
(kids laughing)

08:01.549 --> 08:02.382
- Hold on.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.316
You know kung fu?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.319
Hey, how much to work over
knowledge here?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.454
- You mean to tell me
the great Jade brothers

08:07.454 --> 08:09.122
don't know the martial arts?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.123
(scoffs)

08:10.123 --> 08:11.659
- Badminton was my game.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.494
- Ehh, sissy rackets and lite
birdies.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.830
- [Vinny] If you're not gonna
help, I want my money back.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.798
- Ha!

08:17.798 --> 08:18.966
Does the forest

08:18.966 --> 08:22.469
take back its silence
when the woodchuck farts?

08:22.469 --> 08:24.171
- Look, the point is,

08:24.171 --> 08:27.641
I never took to the whole Asn
thing.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.978
It was Italian culture that
grabbed me.

08:30.978 --> 08:31.912
- Wait, Vincent, Vincent!

08:31.912 --> 08:32.746
(speaking foreign language)

08:32.746 --> 08:33.581
What's wrong?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.082
- I wanna go home.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.183
Even though I was raised in
Chinatown-

08:37.183 --> 08:38.284
- This way!

08:38.284 --> 08:39.820
- [Vinny] I just felt like
any other American kid

08:39.820 --> 08:41.589
in New York City.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.424
A city where you can be anything
you want.

08:44.424 --> 08:47.160
Me, I wanted to be a wiseguy.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.097
They get respect and were
my role models as a kid.

08:50.097 --> 08:50.931
- Vincent.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.765
(speaking foreign language)

08:51.765 --> 08:52.532
Let's go, huh?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.366
No good.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.201
- You talking to me?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.369
Forget about it, you're a wise
guy.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.805
You talkin' to me?

08:57.805 --> 09:00.708
Forget about it, you're a wise
guy.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.350
- [Man] Hey, Vincent!

09:11.351 --> 09:13.020
- You talking to me?

09:13.020 --> 09:16.056
- I call your name, who
else would I be talking to?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.358
- You talking to me?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.460
- I'm looking right at you.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.695
(speaking foreign language)

09:21.695 --> 09:22.529
What are you?

09:22.529 --> 09:23.363
Huh?

09:23.363 --> 09:24.197
Are you sick or something?

09:24.197 --> 09:25.032
Huh?

09:25.032 --> 09:26.033
- Forget about it!

09:26.033 --> 09:26.867
- Huh.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.036
You have ear problem, huh?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.103
Loh Moh, your-

09:30.103 --> 09:31.639
- [Vinny] As you can see,
executing the wiseguy

09:31.639 --> 09:33.140
attitude was gonna take some
time.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.877
In fact, until last month,
I wasn't even close.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.212
- Now, my personal favorites
are these cream-filled.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.715
But for you, I am
thinking are you like uh,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.751
egg tart kinda guy?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.252
Chocolate kinda guy?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.554
Right up here we got these.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.090
Oh, hey Tina!

09:50.090 --> 09:51.391
How, how are things?

09:51.391 --> 09:52.425
- Hey miss Mary.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.761
- [Vinny] That's Tina.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.895
Wow, right?

09:54.895 --> 09:57.931
She dates wise guys, so I
never really had a chance.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.400
That and I always made a
fool of myself around her.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.669
- Hold on, uh, Donny?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.571
Donny, bring up the Di Pocco
order.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.778
- You okay?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.684
What, I got something on my
face?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.252
- Whoa, Tina!

10:19.252 --> 10:20.087
- Donny.

10:20.087 --> 10:20.954
How are ya?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.290
Good to see ya.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.124
- Oh my God!
- Yeah okay.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.025
- Hey listen.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.960
You uh, you like lobsters and
shrimps?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.095
- Yeah, sure.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.529
- How about I take you to the
aquarium?

10:29.529 --> 10:31.264
We watch 'em run around a
little?

10:31.264 --> 10:32.299
- That don't sound fun.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.601
- Let me take you out.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.303
- Donny, I told you a million
times.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.805
You're a nice guy-

10:41.942 --> 10:45.445
- Take a picture, it'll last
longer, okay?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.151
This all could be yours, baby.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.286
- This could be a future?

10:54.621 --> 10:58.325
- Me, you, miss Mary over
there and all the lobster tas

10:58.325 --> 10:59.626
you could eat, baby.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.627
(laughs)

11:00.627 --> 11:01.461
- Please.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.731
Can I get a bag for this?

11:03.731 --> 11:04.898
- This is home.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.666
A five-story walk-up in
Chinatown.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.302
It's traditional Chinese,
except for the lottery

11:09.302 --> 11:11.138
tickets on Buddha's lap.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.474
(hand slams on counter)

11:16.309 --> 11:18.846
Dad thinks vaping traditional
herbs and reading,

11:18.846 --> 11:20.413
"Yin and Yang in the Bedroom"

11:20.413 --> 11:21.982
will keep him virile.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.483
I think it's working.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.819
Mom loves to cook and those
are my two little brothers,

11:25.819 --> 11:27.187
if you can believe it.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.990
(inhales deeply)

11:31.524 --> 11:33.593
What is this an opium den?

11:33.593 --> 11:36.764
- Ah, this stuff balances
your Yin with your Yang.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.665
You should try it sometime,
Vincent.

11:38.665 --> 11:39.833
You are always unhappy.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.169
That's a sign of imbalance.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.671
- My balance is just fine.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.206
(laughs)

11:46.206 --> 11:48.008
- Doesn't seem like balance to
me.

11:48.008 --> 11:48.842
- Hmm.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.010
- Not for nothin', pop,

11:50.010 --> 11:52.012
but you got Buddha, fortune
cookies, lottery tickets,

11:52.012 --> 11:53.680
and buck-wild Antler Essence.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.183
You work yourself ragged
but you never make it big.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.885
That don't seem like balanceo
me.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.120
- You may be my number one s,
huh?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.022
But I'm the giver of life he.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.723
- Forget about it.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.893
- Loh Moh, why does your son
sound like one of those

12:05.893 --> 12:07.895
Mulberry-Street Italians?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.863
- Ugh, if he doesn't want toe
Chinese,

12:09.863 --> 12:12.032
how will you stop him?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.501
- [Vinny] Joey is my best
friend.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.004
He's always looking out for me

12:17.004 --> 12:20.340
- "The Godfather" is one of
the greatest films of all time.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.844
- Yeah, to get that kind of
respect, now that is a real man.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.245
- Yeah, that is pretty good.
What can I get you guys?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.379
- That makes me hungry.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.347
- Yo.
- Oh.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.250
- Can we get uh-
- Hey, what's up guys?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.185
- Give me a couple spicy
sausages and mustard.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.220
- And a couple of drinks.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.054
- Hey!

12:37.057 --> 12:38.391
- Be smart, kid.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.729
- Here ya go buddy, 10 bucks.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.231
- Okay, 100?

12:44.231 --> 12:45.866
- Thank you.
- Well, that's a 100, man.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.034
I don't have change.

12:47.034 --> 12:47.868
- Keep it.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.701
Let's go.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.105
- Got any tacos or enchiladas?

12:53.073 --> 12:55.275
- We got hot links and bone-in
hotdogs.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.443
What do you need?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.277
- Right.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.711
All right, umm, couple of
hotlinks,

12:58.711 --> 13:00.713
little mustard, two sodas.

13:00.713 --> 13:01.748
- You got it.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.552
- Hey!

13:05.552 --> 13:07.387
You got this one, Don Vinny?

13:07.387 --> 13:08.221
- Yeah.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.424
In the presence of two real
goodfellas.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.260
- Yeah I'm surprised they'ren
Manhattan.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.394
- You need more than that.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.228
Thank you.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.063
- What are you talking about?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.931
The mob's all over Manhattan.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.732
- Yeah, Al Capella's men, su,

13:19.732 --> 13:22.769
but those were Condimento's
Brooklyn boys.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.472
- And you know this because
there's a Goomba Gazette?

13:25.472 --> 13:29.910
- Nah, my uncle Eddie
works for Condimento.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.811
- Is your uncle Fountain Soda
Eddie?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.113
- Yeah, he makes sure all
the syrups for the fountain

13:33.113 --> 13:35.648
soda machines are stocked.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.583
- All these years,

13:36.583 --> 13:38.418
Joey Rissotto, you
never thought to mention

13:38.418 --> 13:40.420
your uncle was the Fountain
Soda?

13:40.420 --> 13:43.323
- I am not allowed to talk about
it.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.092
- There she is.

13:45.092 --> 13:45.926
(chimes ringing)

13:45.926 --> 13:48.128
In all her heavenly glory.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.097
- You've known Tina
since we was in school.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.798
You didn't say nothing
then, you won't now.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.766
Forget about it.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.602
- She's my goddess, what can I
say?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.670
- Man up and ask her out.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.107
- All right, I've gotta go.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.641
I'm gonna go to one of
them bicycle classes.

14:01.641 --> 14:02.475
- Oh, good for you.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.310
(chuckles)

14:03.310 --> 14:04.277
- All right, love, I'll see .

14:04.277 --> 14:05.112
- Bye.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.116
- She's coming over here.

14:09.116 --> 14:09.950
- Huh?

14:11.618 --> 14:12.819
Ugh.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.687
Hey Tina, how about we
romance the Big Apple,

14:14.687 --> 14:15.956
just you and I?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.291
- Not a chance.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.792
- Not even a maybe?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.362
- First, you need a bib.

14:22.362 --> 14:26.299
And B, you ain't got no car,
no connections, no nothing.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.001
A girl's gotta secure her future

14:28.001 --> 14:29.636
and when you can understand
that,

14:29.636 --> 14:31.004
maybe you can get a girl like
me?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.973
(car honks)

14:32.973 --> 14:35.642
That's what I'm talking about.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.476
- Call me!

14:37.644 --> 14:39.312
- How women resist you,

14:39.312 --> 14:40.813
I'll never know.

14:40.813 --> 14:41.881
- Help me out.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.150
- What do you want me to do
about it?

14:43.150 --> 14:44.817
She's a lost cause.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.353
- Introduce me to your uncle.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.022
- Vin, in case you haven't
noticed,

14:49.022 --> 14:50.991
you're not Italian.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.160
And not for nothin', it's
a real dangerous life.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.894
Forget about it.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
- Yeah, forget about it.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.665
Too much trouble for a girl
anyway.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.833
- Forget about the girl?

15:00.833 --> 15:02.835
Have you lost your mind?

15:02.835 --> 15:06.073
You must always pursue the girl.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.709
Hah, you never pursued
the girl in your life.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.679
Call girls maybe.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.248
- Would you two quit it and
let me finish the story?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.083
- So?

15:20.753 --> 15:21.588
- Vincent.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.258
(speaking foreign language)

15:27.560 --> 15:30.397
- I'm trying my best, Sifu.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.699
(thudding)

15:33.600 --> 15:34.767
Good job, May.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.906
- If you'd spend more
time at the kwoon with us,

15:39.906 --> 15:41.041
you could have easily won.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.444
(light orchestral music)

15:48.615 --> 15:49.449
- Vincent.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.120
(speaking foreign language)

15:56.789 --> 15:58.891
- I get it, it's for
self-defense

15:58.891 --> 16:01.628
but practicing for mastery,

16:01.628 --> 16:03.630
what's the point, Sifu?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.233
- The art is part of who we are.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.601
It connects us to our
ancestors and culture.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.903
- Kung-fu builds character.

16:10.903 --> 16:15.142
(speaking foreign language)

16:15.142 --> 16:17.410
It all starts from the kwoon.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.578
You must do this

16:18.578 --> 16:20.147
to forge the spirit.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.948
- And it's a lot of fun,

16:21.948 --> 16:24.484
especially when I get
to beat up on Vincent.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.319
- Embrace kung-fu

16:26.319 --> 16:27.920
and see the change.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.624
- You've been practicing
forever, Sifu.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.627
Doing the same thing every d.

16:34.627 --> 16:38.265
But is this life really good
enough?

16:38.265 --> 16:39.832
- More than enough.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.970
(speaking foreign language)

16:43.970 --> 16:46.806
You will see a change in you.

16:46.806 --> 16:50.477
(speaking foreign language)

17:03.022 --> 17:04.656
- I see mango.

17:04.656 --> 17:05.992
- Yeah, there's the other
things.

17:05.992 --> 17:06.992
(laughs)

17:06.992 --> 17:09.596
- Hey, Vincent, good for the
jade stalk!

17:09.596 --> 17:11.030
Hmm?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.365
- I got so much stuff
that's good for that,

17:12.365 --> 17:13.633
you little horndog.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.867
- Oh.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.002
- It will fill your pecker le
a balloon.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.002
- Huh?

17:17.002 --> 17:18.971
Oh, bring me an extra
10 boxes next week, huh?

17:18.971 --> 17:20.207
We Chinese like the green tea.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.808
- And I got avocados on special.

17:21.808 --> 17:22.642
- Huh?

17:22.642 --> 17:23.976
- They're good for the dopamine.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.146
- Come on, man do your job.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.814
- Why don't you shove one of
those bananas

17:27.814 --> 17:28.815
where the sun don't shine?

17:28.815 --> 17:29.982
- I'm helping you out.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.152
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy,
easy.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.653
Wait, wait, wait.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.724
Whoa, hey!

17:37.724 --> 17:38.891
- You're useless little man.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.892
- That's my produce.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.894
Help me get my produce.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.729
Hey.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.064
Hey, Vincent!

17:45.064 --> 17:45.898
Help Me!

17:45.898 --> 17:46.733
Huh what are you doing?

17:46.733 --> 17:47.567
Come.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.401
- [Vinny] I'd had it.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.336
It was time to join the Mob

17:49.336 --> 17:52.038
to get some respect and get e
girl.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.006
So I crossed Canal Street from
Chinatown

17:54.006 --> 17:57.510
into Little Italy in search of
my destiny.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.846
I stumbled onto the two
goodfellas

17:59.846 --> 18:01.013
from the hot dog cart.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.081
It looked like

18:02.081 --> 18:03.716
they were in the middle
of a territory scuffle.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.851
- You should be ashamed of
yourself

18:04.851 --> 18:06.886
with the way oregano smells.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.421
It tastes like sweat.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.856
- He's right, it does.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.192
Listen to me, you tell
Condimento that Al Capella's

18:12.192 --> 18:13.893
got a message for him.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.595
- What's that message again?

18:15.595 --> 18:18.731
- The message is you don't
sell a dash, a pinch, a shaker

18:18.731 --> 18:20.533
of your oregano, you hear me?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.535
You tell Mr. Condominium over
there,

18:22.535 --> 18:24.036
you tell him we find out he
sells

18:24.036 --> 18:25.538
even a sprinkle of that crap

18:25.538 --> 18:27.540
you guys are selling anywhere
in this neighborhood,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.076
he is gonna answer to Mr.
Capella, capice?

18:30.076 --> 18:31.378
- It's now or never.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.913
Time to fulfill my destiny.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.115
(grunting)

18:44.224 --> 18:46.459
(gagging)

18:46.459 --> 18:47.727
Want some mustard with that?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.762
Someone get some mustard
for this line-cutting bitch.

18:49.762 --> 18:50.630
- Oh!

18:50.630 --> 18:52.232
Who are you?

18:52.232 --> 18:54.133
Who interferes in the family
business?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.469
- The man asked you a questi.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.970
- I'm Vinny Chow,

18:57.970 --> 18:59.739
proving myself mob worthy.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.940
- Mob worthy?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.108
- Shall we whack 'em?

19:02.108 --> 19:02.942
- No, no.

19:02.942 --> 19:03.910
We'll bring him in.

19:03.910 --> 19:04.977
Grab 'em.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.747
- Come on, you're coming with
us.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.384
- What?

19:11.384 --> 19:14.153
Come on, let's take him
upstairs to see the boss.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.422
- What is everybody lookin' ?

19:15.422 --> 19:17.324
- Shut up, keep walkin'.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.760
- [Al] Yeah, you just get the
money.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.762
I don't care where he is, you
find him

19:22.762 --> 19:24.163
and bring him down here.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.466
I want every penny he
owes me, you understand?

19:26.466 --> 19:27.934
This is bullcrap.

19:27.934 --> 19:28.768
- Al, Al?

19:28.768 --> 19:29.802
- Well, I gotta go now.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.804
Just do what I told you.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.274
Yeah, what's up Frankie Brows?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.942
- So, we took care of Vito and
Luigi.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.678
We sent a clear message to
Condimento, that's for sure.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.512
- That's good.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.447
- But there's something else.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.181
We got a little bit of a
situation, boss.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.015
- What's that?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.651
- Well, you'll see.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.785
Bring him in.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.154
- We brought you a Chinatown
special.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.188
- Oh, the Moo Goo Gai Pan?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.957
I love those little round
pancakes.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.292
- That dish with the little
pancakes,

19:52.292 --> 19:53.493
that's Moo Shu, not Moo Goo.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.295
Get your hands off that.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.830
- Moo Shu, Moo Goo, screw you.

19:57.830 --> 19:58.965
They;re no freakin' ravioli

19:58.965 --> 20:00.800
but I love those little
round fluffy things

20:00.800 --> 20:03.169
with the bump on the top like
that.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.837
So, nobody brought me takeout?

20:04.837 --> 20:07.139
- No, no, no, like I was saying,
we were sending a message

20:07.139 --> 20:08.475
out to Condimento.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.876
- And then out of nowhere,
this ninja shows up and starts

20:09.876 --> 20:12.044
dropping the one, two on Vito
and Luigi.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.980
And I gotta tell you, it
was a beautiful thing.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.147
- Yeah.
(farts)

20:15.147 --> 20:18.318
He starts shoving red hot pepper
flakes down Vito's throat.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.520
I mean, the poor guy
had tears in his eyes.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.488
(laughs)

20:21.488 --> 20:23.556
- I did it for you, Don Capella.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.157
- You mean to tell me,
you three idiots couldn't

20:25.157 --> 20:27.994
take care of two jerkoffs
from Brooklyn on your own?

20:27.994 --> 20:28.828
- Idiots?

20:28.828 --> 20:29.862
- Excuse me, boss.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.230
But with all due respect,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.866
I think we handled this thing
just fine.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.168
- We can't have the fine
citizens of Little Italy

20:36.168 --> 20:37.670
think that we need help from the
Chinese.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.738
You know what I'm talking about?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.006
- Uh, no, we can't.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.508
That's why we brought him in.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.009
- All right, forget that.

20:43.009 --> 20:43.843
I'm hungry.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.211
Now order me the Chinese
pancakes

20:45.211 --> 20:47.847
with the scallions and the sauce
on it.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.248
And charge it to Spetzia.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.418
He owes me a lot of money.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.520
- Yeah, why don't you two o
find something else to do, h?

20:53.520 --> 20:54.854
- Okay.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.056
- You, kid-
- You, sit down.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.460
All right.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.194
Listen, what do you want from
me, huh?

21:02.194 --> 21:04.931
While I am in a good mood, tk
to me.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.198
- It all started when I was a
kid.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.567
You see-
- You got three seconds.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.235
- I wanna join the family
and become a wiseguy.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.370
(laughs)

21:10.370 --> 21:12.038
- He wants to join the family,
and become,

21:12.038 --> 21:13.373
you ain't even Italian.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.907
- I'm doing the best I can.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.876
(speaking foreign language)

21:16.876 --> 21:18.378
- He's got big balls, this k.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.614
You don't join this here,
I induct you into it.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.882
It's a special thing.

21:22.882 --> 21:27.887
And once I induct you, I give
you an offer you can't refuse.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.389
- Sure, I've seen the movies.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.222
- You've seen the movies.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.123
This ain't the movies.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.560
There's no Chinese wiseguys in
movies.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.527
- No.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.596
- All right, I've had enoughf
you, kid.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.898
You keep sticking your nose
in my business where it

21:38.898 --> 21:40.299
don't belong, and I'm not

21:40.299 --> 21:42.402
going to put you on a slow bt
to China.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.903
I'm gonna put you under one.

21:43.903 --> 21:44.737
Capice?

21:45.905 --> 21:46.739
Get him outta here.

21:46.739 --> 21:47.607
Come on, let's go.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.908
Go on, take a walk.

21:48.908 --> 21:49.909
- He's not kiddin'.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.243
Come on, let's go.

21:51.243 --> 21:54.781
(light orchestral music)

21:54.781 --> 21:56.983
(thuds)

21:56.983 --> 21:58.117
And stay out!

21:58.117 --> 22:00.587
- [Vinny] Going straight to
the top was an epic fail,

22:00.587 --> 22:02.455
but I wasn't giving up.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.425
There had to be another way r
a Chinese

22:05.425 --> 22:08.094
guy to get started in the mafia.

22:17.604 --> 22:18.438
- Yeah, what?

22:18.438 --> 22:19.606
Take it easy, okay?

22:19.606 --> 22:20.473
- Then get up the steps.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.608
- Why do we have to go in here
for?

22:21.608 --> 22:23.510
- Get up, get up those steps.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.112
- You know what you're goin'n
here for!

22:26.112 --> 22:27.013
In here?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.347
- Where do you want to go?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.782
Get in!

22:29.782 --> 22:32.485
(all chattering)

22:36.989 --> 22:38.858
Get in the ring, we'll
straighten you out.

22:38.858 --> 22:39.992
- What do you mean?

22:39.992 --> 22:40.827
What do you mean, straightene
out?

22:40.827 --> 22:41.661
- Come on, come on.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.329
Put these gloves on.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.299
Box a round with little John.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.968
- Little Johnny?
- They call him "The Masher."

22:48.968 --> 22:50.637
(whooshes)

22:50.637 --> 22:52.004
- [Condimento] Wait a minute.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.173
Bring him to me.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.141
- Oh, it's your lucky day.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.344
- [Condimento] Ritchie, get
everybody out.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.312
- Clear the gym.

23:00.312 --> 23:03.149
- So, my sources tell me
Capella's

23:04.984 --> 23:07.487
been moving product into
Brooklyn.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.221
- Capella's man, Frankie Bro,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.724
has been messing with my clerks.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.060
Forced 'em to buy his grated
cheese.

23:14.060 --> 23:14.894
- Yeah?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.328
Well, what'd your boys do?

23:16.328 --> 23:18.665
- They're just boys, what cod
they do?

23:18.665 --> 23:20.500
He made them sign the order.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.201
And no bulk discount!

23:23.069 --> 23:25.071
I sell the grated cheese

23:25.071 --> 23:27.006
and the garlic powder aroundn
Brooklyn.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.176
You don't buy nothin' from
that Manhattan wannabe.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.343
Get him outta here!

23:31.343 --> 23:32.178
- Come on, come on.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.379
Get up, get out.

23:33.379 --> 23:34.213
Let's go.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.047
Come on.

23:35.047 --> 23:35.882
- [Vinny] Look at these two
wannabes

23:35.882 --> 23:37.684
and their fake bruises.

23:37.684 --> 23:40.753
- You two guys are pathetic.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.388
- [Vinny] Too scared to
say what really happened.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.523
- Not for nothin', boss.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.593
We were doing good until a
dozen ninjas attacked us.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.426
- [Condimento] Ninjas?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.561
- Yeah, boss.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.762
They like, they came out of
the shadows or something.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.532
- Capella must have made a
deal with that Hung Phat.

23:52.532 --> 23:55.034
- The Italians and the
Chinese working together?

23:55.034 --> 23:57.069
You know, it's unprecedented,

23:57.069 --> 23:59.105
but not impossible given the
tensions

23:59.105 --> 24:00.773
between the Italians.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.041
- What are we gonna do, boss?

24:02.041 --> 24:05.411
- Well, we got hundreds
of olive oil cans around.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.446
Maybe we put them all over
Chinatown.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.549
- Olive oil is Cappella's
racket.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.751
- Right, Chinese don't buy
Italian.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.453
- We need an inside
man, someone expendable.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.788
- Hung Phat will go to war wh
Capella.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.923
- Exactly.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.424
And when they're knocking
each other off, we're gonna

24:18.424 --> 24:19.559
move right in.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.895
- Hey, we need an Italian
that looks a little Chinese.

24:22.895 --> 24:23.796
Kinda like a crossover.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.064
- Oh, that's a good idea.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.233
Go see who you can see.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.568
- Who are we gonna trust, bo?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.236
- It's not about who we can
trust.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.072
It's about who's dumb enougho
do it.

24:33.072 --> 24:36.142
(all laughing)

24:36.142 --> 24:37.409
- [Vinny] "The highly effecte
made guy

24:37.409 --> 24:39.912
instills fear through
intimidation

24:39.912 --> 24:42.448
and allows no one to refuse him.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.283
He lets his will be known,

24:44.283 --> 24:48.588
but until a Made Guy can
say deeply and honestly,

24:48.588 --> 24:50.089
I am what I am today because

24:50.089 --> 24:52.424
of the choices I made yesterday,

24:52.424 --> 24:56.929
he cannot say I have chosen
the path of the Made Guy."

25:11.277 --> 25:14.013
There's O'Greedy sneaking
into Yam Cha Tong.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.784
Hung Phat's triad headquarters
in the back of a restaurant.

25:17.784 --> 25:20.286
This guy is playing all sides.

25:23.623 --> 25:26.959
- You coming here is asking r
trouble.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.164
- The damn Italians can't
work themselves out.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.634
Their numbers are down and
they're bringing attention

25:34.634 --> 25:35.868
to the operation.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.369
- What is your plan?

25:37.369 --> 25:41.207
- We partner to push out the
Italians, keep the profits,

25:41.207 --> 25:42.709
and the provolone.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.346
- What do you want?

25:48.314 --> 25:50.216
- Enough cash to bribe some
officials

25:50.216 --> 25:51.884
and you to find a way to get
your

25:51.884 --> 25:55.221
products into Little Italy and
Brooklyn.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.058
- Okay.

26:02.528 --> 26:03.495
Ming, (snaps finger)

26:03.495 --> 26:04.330
money!

26:18.510 --> 26:19.746
- Thanks a lot.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.348
(upbeat music)

26:22.348 --> 26:24.383
- That's what I'm talking about,
baby.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.885
Me and you.

26:25.885 --> 26:26.719
Us.

26:26.719 --> 26:27.553
Together.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.223
What more could a girl want?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.224
- Power.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.059
Fame.

26:33.059 --> 26:33.893
Fortune.

26:33.893 --> 26:34.727
- And I'm working up.

26:34.727 --> 26:35.561
I told you.

26:35.561 --> 26:36.395
- You're working up?

26:36.395 --> 26:37.229
You always say you're working
up.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.064
You're not even working?

26:38.064 --> 26:38.898
- Look at the car, Tina!

26:38.898 --> 26:39.866
- Look at the car?

26:39.866 --> 26:42.101
I feel like it's a rental.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.369
- Tina doll.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.370
I've come for you.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.873
- Hey, get your stinking hands
off my car.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.040
I'm talking over here.

26:48.040 --> 26:48.908
- Okay.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.877
I'm Vinny Chow, independent
associate-

26:50.877 --> 26:52.411
- Oh hey, ain't you the guy

26:52.411 --> 26:54.546
who was trying to pick
me up with the hot link?

26:54.546 --> 26:55.715
- Uh, ugh, no.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.416
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was
you.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.918
- Uh, we all look alike?

26:58.918 --> 27:00.552
- That's true.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.421
Are you sure?

27:02.421 --> 27:04.556
- I said we're busy.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.058
Now scram.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.594
- Hey, don't interfere
with family business.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.129
I'm working for Al Capella.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.765
- Oh, well, uh, hold on.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.101
You're working for Mr. Al
Capella?

27:15.101 --> 27:17.069
- Well, I'm not working for Al
Capella.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.739
- "Well, I'm not working forl
Capella."

27:19.739 --> 27:20.572
Huh, huh.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.407
Yeah.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.109
Are you even Italian?

27:23.109 --> 27:25.077
- You, you talkin' to me?

27:25.077 --> 27:26.078
- Get outta here.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.914
Tina, get in the car.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.448
- Hold on.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.318
A girl could get far with
a guy connected to the Don.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.253
- I'm gonna go shake down a
deli.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.621
You're coming with me.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.823
- See ya around, Rocco.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.758
- Tina, get in the car.

27:38.758 --> 27:39.591
Tina!

27:39.591 --> 27:40.760
Fuhgeddaboutit!

27:42.995 --> 27:44.096
- Hey, kid.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.265
Don't you know drinking all
that soda's bad for you?

27:46.265 --> 27:47.099
- Yeah?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.101
My grandfather lived to be 80.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.136
- Did he drink a lot of soda?

27:50.136 --> 27:52.338
- No, he minded his own
business.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.773
- Why you little wiseguy.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.942
Get outta, hey, get out of
here you little, hit the road.

27:55.942 --> 27:56.776
Next!

27:58.444 --> 27:59.812
- Oregano, $3.99.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.448
He's crazy and it stinks.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.451
(upbeat jazz music)

28:16.963 --> 28:19.131
- What are you doing, Vin?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.968
- You know, you gotta watch
what you eat these days.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.136
- It's dry pasta!

28:24.136 --> 28:27.206
- Those hydrogenated oils and
trans fats.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.141
Forget about it.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.843
- Uh, sure, whatever.

28:30.843 --> 28:34.480
Now, go demand some money so
you could take me shopping.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.683
And then maybe I'll take you
somewhere.

28:40.019 --> 28:42.654
Ugh, do something or I'm
leaving.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.157
Maybe I can still catch Rocco?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.233
- Hey, are you Salame?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.169
- For Christ sake, I'm
counting money here.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.838
Hey, what a lovely couple.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.506
Do you like 69?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.674
- I love beef and broccoli.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.346
I'm Vinny Chow, independent
associative of Al Capella.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.581
I'm here to collect 300 large.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.183
- I'm 300 large!

29:11.183 --> 29:13.019
Vinny Chow, what kinda name is
that?

29:13.019 --> 29:16.055
I never heard no Chinese
with an Italian name?

29:16.055 --> 29:18.024
- Just because someone
looks a certain way-

29:18.024 --> 29:19.859
- Vinny, give me a break you.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.027
- I'm here to collect.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.028
You don't pay?

29:22.028 --> 29:23.529
I gotta get rough.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.730
- You're not even Italian.

29:24.730 --> 29:25.764
All right, I'll tell you what?

29:25.764 --> 29:29.101
Get anything you want and
I'll give you 30% off.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.937
- You offering me a discount?

29:30.937 --> 29:32.371
- I'm offering you a discount.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.206
- You're offering me a discount?

29:34.206 --> 29:35.374
- Are you hard of hearing?

29:35.374 --> 29:37.543
I'm offering you a discount.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.411
- I'm here shaking you
down, and you want me

29:39.411 --> 29:41.914
to spend my money here?

29:41.914 --> 29:43.715
- It's my one and only offer.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.584
Try the veal, I'm here all week.

29:45.584 --> 29:46.886
Next?

29:46.886 --> 29:50.256
Oh, buddy, your glasses are
thicker than my provolone.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.623
Get outta here.

29:51.623 --> 29:55.261
- All right, I'll take
a pound of provolone.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.462
- Coming right up.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.065
That's how you do
business at Salame's Deli.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.433
- You're not very good at th,
Vin.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.569
- Why do I need to explain this?

30:03.569 --> 30:04.770
- Uh, because I'm
holding groceries and you

30:04.770 --> 30:06.572
borrowed 20 bucks from me?

30:06.572 --> 30:09.075
- Well, you let me handle the
finances.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.576
- Oh, you ain't gonna be
handlin'

30:10.576 --> 30:12.912
nothin' if you keep this up.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.618
Hey, ma, we brought you
something.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.921
- Did you go to Salame's tod?

30:21.921 --> 30:23.990
- Why do you always gotta ask
me?

30:23.990 --> 30:24.790
- What?

30:24.790 --> 30:26.458
It was 30 off today.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.660
Oh, sorry.

30:30.762 --> 30:34.600
Thank you for bringing this
stuff over.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.969
(door slams)

30:44.443 --> 30:47.613
(tires screeching)

30:47.613 --> 30:48.447
- Hey, get in the car.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.281
- No way.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.283
Why?
- Get in the car.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.319
(door slams)

30:53.319 --> 30:54.286
(tires screech)

30:54.286 --> 30:55.787
(light piano music)

30:55.787 --> 30:56.788
- Come here, you son of a bitch.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.624
Get over there!

30:58.624 --> 31:00.026
Come on, come on.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.299
- Look at this.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.800
(laughs)

31:08.800 --> 31:09.801
- Look at me, you.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.503
You think this is a big joke,
huh?

31:11.503 --> 31:13.005
- No, it's no joke.

31:13.005 --> 31:13.839
This is kinda funny though.

31:13.839 --> 31:14.673
Am I right?

31:14.673 --> 31:15.507
- Oh, yeah?

31:15.507 --> 31:16.342
You think what I do is funny?

31:16.342 --> 31:17.509
Maybe you think I'm funny.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.978
Funny how?

31:18.978 --> 31:19.811
- What?

31:19.811 --> 31:20.646
No.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.481
- I know what it is, you lite
rat.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.016
You think you're the Godfath.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.184
Or maybe you think you're the
freakin'

31:25.184 --> 31:26.652
Pope of Greenwich Village, h?

31:26.652 --> 31:28.887
- I'm just trying to
prove myself mob worthy.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.322
- This ain't "The Sopranos",
kid.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.191
I don't care what you do on
the other side of Canal Stre.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.561
But over here, nobody
messes with Al Capella.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.662
I had enough of you.

31:36.662 --> 31:37.997
Get the bats.

31:37.997 --> 31:38.864
- With pleasure.

31:38.864 --> 31:39.698
- Please.

31:40.899 --> 31:41.733
- No, no, no, no.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.335
That, not that bat.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.403
Get the wax ones.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.704
Not that one.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.506
No, not that one either.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.675
- Cheese, you wanna hit him with
cheese?

31:49.675 --> 31:51.377
- That's too expensive!

31:51.377 --> 31:52.678
That's the one.

31:52.678 --> 31:53.512
Crack him!

31:54.680 --> 31:56.915
(grunting)

31:59.918 --> 32:02.688
All right, that's enough.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.855
Now, get him outta here.

32:03.855 --> 32:04.923
- [Knowledge] Ah, ya!

32:04.923 --> 32:06.758
Why do you pursue them?

32:06.758 --> 32:09.061
Where is the motivation?

32:09.061 --> 32:12.031
- Every child thinks they're
special.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.733
My parents with all their
offspring.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.903
And I saw made guys getting
attention and respect.

32:17.903 --> 32:21.273
- Your family never rejected
you.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.775
And May is there for you.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.713
- No wiseguy ever had a
Chinese girl on his arm.

32:27.713 --> 32:30.549
- You're disturbed in so many
ways.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.720
So, what about your wounds?

32:35.554 --> 32:38.090
- I went to ask my master for
help.

32:38.090 --> 32:38.924
- Ha!

32:38.924 --> 32:40.892
Of course, you did.

32:40.892 --> 32:43.395
(doorbell buzzing)

32:43.395 --> 32:44.563
- [Vinny] I knew Sifu would x
me up

32:44.563 --> 32:45.631
without all the questions.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.465
- [Sifu] What happened?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.566
(groans)

32:47.566 --> 32:49.801
- I was admiring the uh,
the majestic cherry blossoms

32:49.801 --> 32:51.570
when my bike flipped.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.239
- If you would've developed your
kung-fu.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.940
This wouldn't happen.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.109
Ah.

32:58.244 --> 33:01.613
(speaking foreign language)

33:01.613 --> 33:03.415
- [Vinny] He taught me about
body pressure points used

33:03.415 --> 33:05.917
to heal or to hurt someone

33:05.917 --> 33:08.087
(bones cracking)

33:08.087 --> 33:10.756
(groans)

33:10.756 --> 33:15.761
(bones cracking)
(magical chimes ringing)

33:31.177 --> 33:32.178
- Now, rest.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.285
- Vincent!

33:39.285 --> 33:41.120
- May!
- Stay.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.121
Sifu called.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.623
I came as soon as I could.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.024
- I've got something to do in
Flushing.

33:46.024 --> 33:46.858
Excuse me.

33:49.495 --> 33:50.329
- What happened?

33:50.329 --> 33:52.298
- [Sifu] Fell of a bike!

33:54.166 --> 33:56.001
- You don't have a bike.

33:56.001 --> 33:58.304
(groans)

33:58.304 --> 33:59.138
- Ice cream?

33:59.138 --> 34:02.508
(light orchestral music)

34:13.319 --> 34:16.655
I wanted to get the best
jade bracelet for my girl.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.158
And Ting's was just the place.

34:32.704 --> 34:35.005
Best place for Chinese ice
cream.

34:35.005 --> 34:37.342
They have lychee with red bes
and sweet

34:37.342 --> 34:39.511
and sour sauce and no MSG.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.047
Now, I look like an asshole.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.350
- Why?

34:44.350 --> 34:45.984
- Because I didn't hold the
door.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.319
- It's all right.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.888
I can buy you ice cream.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.056
(giggles)

34:56.928 --> 35:00.065
- [Vinny] Your own art galle,
exciting.

35:00.065 --> 35:00.899
- I know.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.370
The opening is in a week.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.071
Would you go with me?

35:06.071 --> 35:07.206
- Sure.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.774
- Promise?

35:08.774 --> 35:11.177
- You did all these?

35:11.177 --> 35:13.579
- Hmm, yep, all of them.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.447
You're really talented.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.251
- Thank you for noticing.

35:19.251 --> 35:23.789
- You have so many admirers,
why aren't you dating?

35:23.789 --> 35:26.625
- I guess I just had my
heart set on one special guy

35:26.625 --> 35:29.861
for as long as I can remember.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.097
- I know how you feel, May.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.267
- Vincent I-

35:35.267 --> 35:36.402
- No matter how hard I
try, I just can't get

35:36.402 --> 35:38.069
Tina to fall for me.

35:42.073 --> 35:45.076
- Have you tried to be yourself,
Vincent?

35:45.076 --> 35:47.946
I mean, why try to be like
others?

35:47.946 --> 35:49.948
You're perfect as you are.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.918
- I don't expect you to
understand.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.322
- To understand you can't live
Italian when you're Chinese?

35:56.322 --> 35:58.257
- Did not acting Chinese stop
Warner Oland

35:58.257 --> 36:00.259
from being Charlie Chan?

36:00.259 --> 36:02.661
- He was acting for televisi,
playing a stereotype.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.963
Like you are doing right now
because you think a certain

36:04.963 --> 36:06.632
kind of girl will like you.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.434
It's not real.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.936
- You pretend to be nice, May.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.471
You're judgmental like the rest.

36:12.471 --> 36:16.942
- Vincent, I would never-
- I need some air.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.144
I'm gonna have lunch with Jo,
anyway.

36:19.144 --> 36:19.978
(sighs)

36:19.978 --> 36:21.179
- Please, don't go?

36:21.179 --> 36:24.350
- Men, at some time are
masters of their fates.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.117
The fault, dear Brutus,

36:26.117 --> 36:27.653
is not in our stars

36:28.520 --> 36:30.822
but in ourselves that we are
underlings.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.992
(dramatic orchestral music)

36:33.992 --> 36:35.861
(audience applauding)

36:35.861 --> 36:38.297
(giggles)

36:38.297 --> 36:39.498
Well, thank you, my darlings.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.000
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

36:42.000 --> 36:42.834
Um, wait.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.703
Oh, who has the flyers for the
show?

36:44.703 --> 36:47.706
(upbeat jazz music)

36:53.011 --> 36:54.313
- My mom says hi and

36:54.313 --> 36:55.647
this is for you.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.017
Oh. I love me some Mexican.

36:59.017 --> 37:00.652
- [Lawrence] Afternoon, Jose.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.220
- What's going on, Lawrence?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.556
- Well, you look horrendous.

37:05.391 --> 37:09.328
And you look like you could
use some stress relief.

37:09.328 --> 37:12.564
Here, let me get those
shoulders.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.665
(giggles)

37:13.665 --> 37:14.700
- Hey, Lawrence.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.502
- Oh, it's never easy, is it?

37:16.502 --> 37:18.003
(giggles)

37:18.003 --> 37:21.340
Anyway, here are some flyers
for our new production

37:21.340 --> 37:23.709
of Julius Caesar. Come down
to the playhouse and

37:23.709 --> 37:25.344
play with us sometime.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.846
- Asians don't look good in
tights.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.181
- Yeah? Says you... Oh!

37:31.583 --> 37:35.554
those bags under your eyes are
bigger than a Queen's purse.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.923
I am offended by this, blech!

37:37.923 --> 37:42.928
Do yourself and me a favor
and apply some Preparation H.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.898
- His eyes are swollen, not s
ass.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.900
- It constricts swollen tiss,
sweetie.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.070
Oh, um, do you mind taping
these to the tops of pizza boxes

37:52.070 --> 37:53.605
so, they go out with deliveries?

37:53.605 --> 37:54.873
- Yeah, put a stack over the.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.376
- Ah, you are a doll.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.277
Okay, I take my leave of you.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.046
I will see you Saturday at
brunch.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.047
- Yeah, forget about it.
- Okay, bye.

38:02.881 --> 38:03.715
- Yeah.

38:03.715 --> 38:04.916
What is with you anyway, Vin?

38:04.916 --> 38:06.385
- I'm just feeling down.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.619
- Marone!

38:07.619 --> 38:09.254
You didn't expect to do

38:09.254 --> 38:11.457
what you did and not
get roughed up, did you?

38:11.457 --> 38:13.091
I mean tryin' to extort
a pound of provolone

38:13.091 --> 38:15.260
at Capella's corner?
- I was doing it for Tina.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.064
Anyways, May and I had a fig.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.100
Whatever it is, she's probably
right.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.403
The people closest to you dot
like to see you get hurt.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.937
- No...

38:25.937 --> 38:27.606
- Put a word in with your uncle.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.408
If Al Capella won't take me,

38:29.408 --> 38:31.242
maybe Condimento will?

38:35.447 --> 38:37.248
- That's a big request.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.083
- I know.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.452
If it backfires, they'll break
your legs.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.288
But that's what friends do,
right?

38:47.092 --> 38:49.928
- All right, I, I can talk to
him.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.630
- Thanks.

38:54.099 --> 38:57.769
(dramatic orchestral music)

39:03.308 --> 39:05.677
Hung Phat had the idea of
relabeling ramen noodles

39:05.677 --> 39:10.181
as Marco Polo Pasta and
moving them into Little Italy.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.959
- [Sean] Gentlemen.

39:40.479 --> 39:44.149
(speaking foreign language)

39:49.154 --> 39:51.056
- The Italians stole our
noodles,

39:51.056 --> 39:52.357
called it spaghetti.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.660
We must steal it back.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.027
- Japanese ramen.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.364
Why not Chinese noodles?

40:00.499 --> 40:04.169
(speaking foreign language)

40:10.008 --> 40:12.210
(laughing)

40:13.545 --> 40:18.016
- Stupid fool, we must
respect honored noodles.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.552
We use Japanese to fool
Italians.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.855
(laughs sarcastically)

40:26.191 --> 40:29.761
- That might work for a while
but

40:29.761 --> 40:32.698
we need a better plan to ruin
them.

40:32.698 --> 40:35.066
I want all their territory.

40:35.066 --> 40:35.901
All of it.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.103
- Everything is good.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.106
Our trucks are ready to
deliver first thing tomorrow.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.373
- I've got men in place

40:42.373 --> 40:45.243
to arrest the Italians
if they start trouble.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.779
Disturbing the peace, and all
that.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.550
(speaking foreign language)

40:51.550 --> 40:53.752
(laughing)

40:59.390 --> 41:00.391
(coughing)

41:00.391 --> 41:04.062
(speaking foreign language)

41:10.636 --> 41:12.303
- [Vinny] If his plan backfires,

41:12.303 --> 41:16.608
there's gonna be big
trouble in little Chinatown.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.944
So, Hung Phat called on its top
masters

41:18.944 --> 41:20.912
and their disciples for backup.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.749
(percussive music)

42:40.358 --> 42:42.327
- Forms don't hit back.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.231
(grunting)

42:56.875 --> 42:59.177
(shouting)

43:10.555 --> 43:12.858
(laughing)

43:15.193 --> 43:16.494
- So, what'd you bring me?

43:16.494 --> 43:18.363
- Well, listen, we're jarring
up the sauce over here at the

43:18.363 --> 43:20.031
Kitchen Conciliere now.

43:20.031 --> 43:21.767
And we're using all
your spices to make it.

43:21.767 --> 43:24.235
And uh, we are gonna sell
it in the supermarkets.

43:24.235 --> 43:25.103
And here's the best part.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.404
- I get 10%.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.538
- 10?

43:27.538 --> 43:29.540
Well, if you only want 10,
but we got you in for 20.

43:29.540 --> 43:30.541
- Oh, you're a beautiful thi.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.377
- And well, Capella thinks
he's in for a piece.

43:32.377 --> 43:33.211
- Yeah, you know what?

43:33.211 --> 43:34.212
- 5% and that's it for him.

43:34.212 --> 43:35.213
- You did the right thing.

43:35.213 --> 43:36.447
You made the right decision.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.049
You know, I had my doubts abt
you,

43:38.049 --> 43:39.550
but you did good, you know,
right?

43:39.550 --> 43:40.551
- I hope so?

43:40.551 --> 43:41.787
- All right, we'll talk later.
That's about it.

43:41.787 --> 43:43.554
- You take care, all right?
- Alright, goodbye. Alright.

43:43.922 --> 43:47.458
Oh, you're like an animal over
there, huh?

43:47.458 --> 43:49.460
Like, drink uh, like a man.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.561
Like a man!

43:50.561 --> 43:51.897
- Like this, boss.

43:51.897 --> 43:53.732
- You see this guy, Jojo?

43:53.732 --> 43:55.734
He used to work for Capella.

43:55.734 --> 43:57.135
Now he's with us.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.403
He understands.

43:58.403 --> 44:01.740
- He may understand but doese
remember?

44:01.740 --> 44:03.474
And where are my two liters?

44:03.474 --> 44:05.443
- Understanding is not enough.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.913
You need to control him.

44:07.913 --> 44:09.748
(grunting)

44:09.748 --> 44:10.581
- I control him.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.650
You see how much he shows me
respect?

44:12.650 --> 44:14.085
- That's reactionary!

44:14.085 --> 44:16.121
If you're gonna win this war,
you need to

44:16.121 --> 44:17.255
be proactive.

44:18.456 --> 44:21.592
Start moving product into new
territory,

44:21.592 --> 44:22.961
slash the tires of your

44:22.961 --> 44:26.097
competition and take over thr
routes

44:26.097 --> 44:27.766
- I'm doing everything you wt
me to do,

44:27.766 --> 44:29.801
but I need more insurances.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.837
- I'll make sure your
men don't get arrested,

44:31.837 --> 44:33.839
you gotta up the effort.

44:39.477 --> 44:40.311
- Boy!
- That was weird.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.613
- Whoa, you're telling me, h?

44:42.613 --> 44:45.616
pharmacy
pick me up some meds, huh?

44:45.616 --> 44:48.686
- And some extra strength
little blue pills.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.155
- Blue pills?

44:50.155 --> 44:51.957
Hey, what do you have
problems with your pipes

44:51.957 --> 44:52.958
and your equipment?

44:52.958 --> 44:54.993
- Fonggu, it's my 25-year-old
girlfriend

44:54.993 --> 44:56.828
and those fried empanadas.

44:56.828 --> 44:59.330
I can't resist either.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.199
- Why don't you try these?

45:01.199 --> 45:03.301
They work for me.

45:03.301 --> 45:05.804
(phone rings)

45:09.340 --> 45:10.475
- Hey, yeah?

45:10.475 --> 45:12.310
Yeah, how you doing, Joey?

45:12.310 --> 45:13.144
Huh?

45:13.144 --> 45:13.979
How is your mom?

45:13.979 --> 45:15.213
Good, good, good.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.315
Yeah, yeah, shoot.

45:17.315 --> 45:18.216
Oh, really?

45:19.550 --> 45:22.153
Oh, I'll see what I can do.

45:22.153 --> 45:22.988
- What's that?

45:22.988 --> 45:24.489
You got that look.

45:25.824 --> 45:27.325
- That was my nephew.

45:27.325 --> 45:29.160
You won't believe what he just
asked me.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.896
It's like a miracle from the
Lord.

45:30.896 --> 45:32.330
- How is that?

45:32.330 --> 45:34.900
- He's got this friend who's
got that specific look we

45:34.900 --> 45:36.334
were talking about?

45:36.334 --> 45:38.069
He wants a job!

45:38.069 --> 45:39.871
- Why don't you ask the guy
to meet us at the diner?

45:39.871 --> 45:41.339
I'll be in the back, listening
in.

45:41.339 --> 45:42.173
Okay?

45:46.711 --> 45:47.846
- Joey!

45:47.846 --> 45:50.348
thank you so much for
talking to your uncle for me.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.349
- It's okay.

45:51.349 --> 45:53.351
He said he had a, uh, a
dangerous job for

45:53.351 --> 45:54.886
a unique type of individual.

45:54.886 --> 45:56.421
- Dangerous?

45:56.421 --> 45:58.356
- You want this or not?

45:59.757 --> 46:00.892
- Yeah, yeah.

46:00.892 --> 46:04.362
(light orchestral music)

46:08.699 --> 46:10.368
- That guy don't give up.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.570
(laughing)

46:14.906 --> 46:15.740
- All right.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.943
We got a lemon lime,

46:17.943 --> 46:19.544
we got a cherry,

46:19.544 --> 46:20.912
we got a regular.

46:20.912 --> 46:22.080
Anything else?

46:23.214 --> 46:26.217
- Never grab another man's
beverage.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.555
It appears that you, Mr. Chow,

46:30.555 --> 46:34.225
are uniquely qualified
for a very special job.

46:34.225 --> 46:35.793
- Thank you, Uncle Eddie.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.395
May I call you uncle?

46:37.395 --> 46:39.097
- No, you may not.

46:39.097 --> 46:39.931
- No, of course not.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.066
Uh, Mr. Soda.

46:43.902 --> 46:47.072
(wind chimes ringing)

46:47.906 --> 46:48.974
(fingers snapping)

46:48.974 --> 46:50.275
- Hey, pay attention over he.

46:50.275 --> 46:52.610
- Hey, you don't snap at me.

46:53.912 --> 46:56.247
- Look, you got this or what?

46:56.247 --> 46:57.748
'Cause I gotta go.

46:59.084 --> 47:01.752
Be at my place seven o'clock
tonight.

47:01.752 --> 47:04.956
Bring this dinner and do me
a favor, Tina, don't be late.

47:04.956 --> 47:05.790
Okay?

47:11.296 --> 47:13.464
- You are not going over the.

47:13.464 --> 47:14.599
- What can a girl do?

47:14.599 --> 47:16.001
It's slim pickins around here.

47:16.001 --> 47:18.303
- Well, it depends what
you're looking for.

47:18.303 --> 47:22.107
willing to build a life
Every gitogether.es a man

47:22.107 --> 47:23.141
- I think you should know that

47:23.141 --> 47:25.143
this job presents a unique
challenge.

47:25.143 --> 47:27.445
It is very dangerous.

47:27.445 --> 47:28.846
Do we understand?

47:28.846 --> 47:31.116
- Vinny is up for any challenge.

47:31.116 --> 47:32.317
- When we're together,

47:32.317 --> 47:34.452
you do not speak unless I tell
you.

47:34.452 --> 47:36.021
Do you understand?

47:36.021 --> 47:38.689
(phone ringing)

47:41.960 --> 47:42.793
Yeah?

47:44.629 --> 47:45.496
Okay, yeah.

47:46.864 --> 47:50.168
Okay, Don Condimento wants
to talk to you personally.

47:50.168 --> 47:53.371
I'm going to take you
back to see him, okay?

47:53.371 --> 47:57.208
Listen, you act cool and
you don't make a scene.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.476
We don't want any undue
attention.

47:58.476 --> 48:00.345
Do we understand?

48:00.345 --> 48:01.679
- Yeah.

48:01.679 --> 48:03.348
Of course, for sure.

48:05.850 --> 48:07.852
(sighing)

48:07.852 --> 48:10.855
- Listen, uh, what's wrong wh
you?

48:11.689 --> 48:14.025
I told you to be cool.

48:14.025 --> 48:15.660
You wrinkled my jacket.

48:15.660 --> 48:16.794
- Sorry.

48:16.794 --> 48:20.565
I didn't know "take you to
the back" meant one booth.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.233
- Come on, get in there, the two
of you.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.068
Sit down.

48:28.039 --> 48:28.873
Move over.

48:31.576 --> 48:35.713
- I understand you're looking
for a job with the family.

48:35.713 --> 48:37.515
I understand you're willing

48:37.515 --> 48:39.750
to do what it takes to earn a
position

48:39.750 --> 48:41.019
in the family.

48:41.019 --> 48:44.522
I understand that you don't k
questions.

48:44.522 --> 48:45.523
- Yes, Mr. Condimento.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.525
- You don't talk to me.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.694
In fact, you never met me.

48:51.196 --> 48:52.697
If you got something to say,

48:52.697 --> 48:55.366
you say to Eddie here.

48:55.366 --> 48:58.903
- Please tell Mr. Condimento
I said, "Yes, sir."

48:58.903 --> 49:00.371
- You will distribute 300
gallons

49:00.371 --> 49:02.207
of olive oil in Chinatown.

49:02.207 --> 49:03.574
Clean and simple.

49:04.609 --> 49:07.212
- This is unorthodox, never been
done.

49:07.212 --> 49:08.713
And, you do not mess up

49:08.713 --> 49:11.216
or you will face serious
consequences.

49:11.216 --> 49:14.552
Serious consequences
for you and your family.

49:14.552 --> 49:16.121
- Do we understand?

49:17.122 --> 49:18.556
- Yes.

49:18.556 --> 49:19.557
You won't regret this.

49:19.557 --> 49:20.725
- You don't talk to nobody,

49:20.725 --> 49:23.228
nobody about this arrangement.

49:24.729 --> 49:25.763
Huh?

49:25.763 --> 49:26.964
- Do we understand?

49:26.964 --> 49:29.234
- Enough with this "do we
understand?"

49:29.234 --> 49:31.236
I think he understands.

49:31.236 --> 49:32.437
- Sorry, boss.

49:32.437 --> 49:34.305
You know how I get when
I don't have my soda.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.906
- Do we understand?

49:38.609 --> 49:39.444
- [Eddie] Leave us now.

49:39.444 --> 49:40.278
Come on.

49:40.278 --> 49:41.579
Get outta here.

49:50.821 --> 49:51.956
- I think that went really well.

49:51.956 --> 49:52.790
- Yeah?

49:54.125 --> 49:57.628
(camera shutter clicking)

49:58.596 --> 49:59.797
- Hmm.

49:59.797 --> 50:00.631
You know,

50:01.599 --> 50:05.336
I think we just found someone
stupid enough to do this.

50:05.336 --> 50:06.171
- I think we did.

50:06.171 --> 50:07.605
(laughing)

50:07.605 --> 50:09.607
- You gotta watch all that
sugar.

50:09.607 --> 50:12.277
You're going to catch the
diabetes.

50:12.277 --> 50:13.811
- I use protection.

50:15.180 --> 50:17.348
- [Man] I got four skippers
coming in and one of them

50:17.348 --> 50:19.350
I think is working for
Condimento himself.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.318
- [Man] Really?

50:20.318 --> 50:22.820
- We gotta find out who it is.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.325
- Well, I gotta get going, boss.

50:27.325 --> 50:28.159
- No.

50:28.159 --> 50:28.993
You ain't going nowhere.

50:28.993 --> 50:29.827
Sit down.

50:29.827 --> 50:32.130
- Why, what's up?

50:32.130 --> 50:34.865
- You might have to make funeral
arrangements for somebody.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.000
- Funeral arrangements, for who?

50:36.000 --> 50:36.834
Who died?

50:44.342 --> 50:45.976
- I don't know yet.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.647
Let me get around here.

50:56.654 --> 50:59.890
(dramatic orchestral music)

50:59.890 --> 51:01.826
What I gotta deal with.

51:04.162 --> 51:05.896
What are you looking away for?

51:05.896 --> 51:09.700
- Al, can you let me off the
hook, please?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.569
For old time's sake.

51:11.569 --> 51:13.171
- Jojo, I love you.

51:14.705 --> 51:17.007
(laughing)

51:20.678 --> 51:22.213
God bless you, pal.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.252
* Ave Maria

51:31.689 --> 51:35.526
(singing in foreign language)

51:37.262 --> 51:38.863
He sings good, huh?

51:41.432 --> 51:44.869
(light orchestral music)

51:46.237 --> 51:48.606
- I just had the greatest day.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.275
May, I'm sorry about yesterd.

51:50.275 --> 51:53.278
I was just a little anxious
about things.

51:53.278 --> 51:54.545
- Tell us about your day.

51:54.545 --> 51:55.580
- Yes.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.615
Where have you been, Vincent?

51:57.615 --> 52:00.718
You were supposed to be hee
at noon to watch your siblin.

52:00.718 --> 52:02.587
- I had a job interview.

52:02.587 --> 52:04.722
- An interview?

52:04.722 --> 52:06.557
What position?

52:06.557 --> 52:08.593
- Delivering olive oil.

52:08.593 --> 52:11.229
- Italian olive oil, huh?

52:11.229 --> 52:13.097
How much do they pay you?

52:13.097 --> 52:15.600
- It's a trial period.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.734
Forget about it.

52:16.734 --> 52:17.735
- Loh Moh!

52:17.735 --> 52:18.969
Uh, uh, did you hear this?

52:18.969 --> 52:20.405
The Italians are making
slave labor of the,

52:20.405 --> 52:22.740
of the stupid among us.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.142
- Marone, I'm dyin' over here.

52:26.076 --> 52:28.613
- What happened to your
Chinese accent, Vincent?

52:28.613 --> 52:30.080
- I was raised in New York, .

52:30.080 --> 52:31.449
I never had a Chinese accent.

52:31.449 --> 52:34.419
- He eats too much
spaghetti when he's out.

52:34.419 --> 52:37.154
- Vincent, my gallery
is in a couple of days.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.923
Promise to escort me?

52:40.291 --> 52:42.260
- I'll be there, May.
I promise.

52:42.260 --> 52:43.661
Now, if you'll excuse me,

52:43.661 --> 52:45.930
I have a really big day
tomorrow.

52:45.930 --> 52:48.333
(sighing)

52:48.333 --> 52:49.634
- When he comes around,

52:49.634 --> 52:52.470
the world will finally make
sense.

52:53.638 --> 52:56.807
-We only wish the best
for Vincent.

52:56.807 --> 53:00.110
But why you wait for him
is a great mystery.

53:00.345 --> 53:02.012
- It's all I can do.

53:02.480 --> 53:05.350
I love his authenticity. He
lives from his heart.

53:06.183 --> 53:09.787
could
- Ifproduce authentic jobs.rt

53:11.622 --> 53:12.790
- [Vinny] There I was,

53:12.790 --> 53:14.859
pushing Italian olive oil in
Chinatown.

53:14.859 --> 53:17.295
My first stop was Liu's herbal
shop.

53:27.972 --> 53:31.509
- Vincent, what have you got
there?

53:31.509 --> 53:34.144
- Ancient Liu, this is olive
oil.

53:34.144 --> 53:35.980
- Difficult product to sell in
Chinatown.

53:35.980 --> 53:38.148
- It's the best olive oil
money can buy, though.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.985
Fresh olives, pressed only once.

53:40.985 --> 53:42.653
It's called extra virgin.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.154
- Virgin?

53:44.154 --> 53:45.490
We like our virgins.

53:45.490 --> 53:47.825
- Yeah, how many cases you want?

53:47.825 --> 53:49.394
Uh, you can infuse them with
your tonics.

53:49.394 --> 53:52.663
- My herbs make a limp man
solid.

53:52.663 --> 53:55.366
Your father, best customer.

53:55.366 --> 53:59.003
Enormous libido makes his back
weak.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.338
Cause and effect, you know?

54:00.338 --> 54:01.672
- Sure.

54:01.672 --> 54:03.007
Because you are so good to my
father,

54:03.007 --> 54:05.175
I'll give you a discount.

54:05.175 --> 54:06.677
- You're a good son.

54:06.677 --> 54:08.713
You look after your parents

54:08.713 --> 54:11.349
and you care for their health.

54:11.349 --> 54:12.850
That is honorable.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.421
- Thanks, ancient one.

54:16.421 --> 54:17.522
But I-

54:17.522 --> 54:21.191
- Vincent, your father
has good credit here.

54:25.696 --> 54:29.567
- Ancient Liu is just so
darn polite and spiritual.

54:29.567 --> 54:31.702
Or did he just hustle me?

54:34.539 --> 54:37.041
(door chimes)

54:38.409 --> 54:41.879
(light orchestral music)

54:44.382 --> 54:45.383
Hey, how are you doing?

54:45.383 --> 54:47.552
You want some olive oil?

54:47.552 --> 54:48.386
- Huh?

54:48.386 --> 54:50.120
- You want some olive oil?

54:50.120 --> 54:50.955
- No.

54:50.955 --> 54:51.789
- No?

54:51.789 --> 54:52.890
Are you sure?

55:03.233 --> 55:06.070
This was an actual job with e
mob.

55:06.070 --> 55:08.573
But no one was taking the oil.

55:25.255 --> 55:26.757
I just had to prove myself.

55:26.757 --> 55:27.925
I couldn't fail.

55:27.925 --> 55:30.761
It's time to use intimidation
and force the noodle maker

55:30.761 --> 55:32.262
to buy olive oil.

55:32.262 --> 55:33.097
- [Woman] No!

55:33.097 --> 55:33.931
I don't buy.

55:33.931 --> 55:35.132
Peanut oil only.

55:35.132 --> 55:36.834
- I got a full shipment of olive
oil.

55:36.834 --> 55:39.136
- [Woman] I tell you, I
have plenty wok oil here.

55:39.136 --> 55:39.970
- No, no, no.

55:39.970 --> 55:41.506
I give the orders around here.

55:41.506 --> 55:44.842
Go tell your little boys to go
stock it!

55:46.977 --> 55:47.812
Ahh.

55:54.452 --> 55:55.352
- You go now.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.021
I call Mr. Hung Phat.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.489
- Forget about it.

55:58.489 --> 56:00.357
- Forget about nothing, I hit
you again.

56:00.357 --> 56:01.659
Waste my time.

56:01.659 --> 56:05.630
(speaking foreign language)

56:08.799 --> 56:11.969
- The ginger fresh. Just come
in.

56:12.470 --> 56:15.540
Ah, look at this lettuce.
Organic!

56:21.479 --> 56:23.981
Ah, excellent okra. Yeah, go.

56:26.316 --> 56:27.718
So, you're here, huh?

56:33.057 --> 56:36.160
Yes, look at these oranges.
Fresh!

56:36.561 --> 56:38.829
- Just dropping off some this
from Liu the Ancient.

56:40.531 --> 56:42.399
- Ooh. (chuckles)

56:43.033 --> 56:45.169
- Got some things in there
for mom, too.

56:45.169 --> 56:46.403
- Alright.

56:47.672 --> 56:51.241
Oh, yeah it's nice. Oh, jeeze.

56:51.241 --> 56:53.010
Oh my gosh. Sorry, huh.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.517
Take this one. This one
whole. Not broken.

57:00.350 --> 57:04.021
(speaking foreign language)

57:08.859 --> 57:10.094
(laughing)

57:10.094 --> 57:12.196
- Olive oil in Chinatown.

57:12.196 --> 57:13.263
Vincent Chow.

57:14.532 --> 57:16.200
- I can deal with him.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.568
Bring me Vincent Chow!

57:17.568 --> 57:18.402
Now!

57:20.037 --> 57:20.871
- Angora!

57:20.871 --> 57:21.706
knock it off.

57:21.706 --> 57:22.540
Sit down.

57:23.708 --> 57:26.210
This is very important today.

57:26.210 --> 57:28.746
Don Vincenzo's coming in from
Sicily to set things right

57:28.746 --> 57:30.380
between the crews.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.716
- Condimento's got no power
though.

57:31.716 --> 57:33.784
- Well, he's got enough
juice to bring the Don in on

57:33.784 --> 57:35.285
special occasion, doesn't he?

57:35.285 --> 57:36.120
- Yeah.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.287
- Here's what we're gonna do.

57:37.287 --> 57:38.723
We're gonna pick him up at the
airport.

57:38.723 --> 57:39.790
You got it?

57:39.790 --> 57:40.925
I'm gonna show him the ledger.

57:40.925 --> 57:43.260
I gotta be very persuasive.

57:43.260 --> 57:44.629
You two get the limo ready.

57:44.629 --> 57:45.896
Make sure it's polished.

57:45.896 --> 57:47.397
Make sure the cheese is aged.

57:47.397 --> 57:48.699
And, you know what?

57:48.699 --> 57:50.100
Get some homemade wine, I thk
the old man will like that.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.401
Okay?

57:51.401 --> 57:53.571
And then, go to Chinatown
and find out what

57:53.571 --> 57:55.072
the hell is going on over the

57:55.072 --> 57:57.575
'cause something ain't kosher.

58:00.310 --> 58:01.311
What are you waiting for?

58:01.311 --> 58:02.146
Go!

58:03.581 --> 58:04.582
They're like the gang that
couldn't

58:04.582 --> 58:05.816
shoot straight, these two.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.252
Where'd you get 'em?

58:08.252 --> 58:13.257
(upbeat electronic music)
(all chattering)

58:20.765 --> 58:25.502
- May, how are you and
Vincent, uh, getting it on?

58:25.502 --> 58:28.272
- Auntie is only looking after
your futures.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.140
Vincent has yet to have a nice
date.

58:30.140 --> 58:32.777
We have hopes that the two of
you.

58:32.777 --> 58:34.679
- Let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

58:34.679 --> 58:37.848
We just want the best partner
for our May.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.617
- Look at you with your art
opening.

58:39.617 --> 58:40.851
(laughing)

58:40.851 --> 58:41.686
- I know.

58:41.686 --> 58:43.353
(chuckles)

58:43.353 --> 58:44.188
- You know what?

58:44.188 --> 58:45.455
Guys, have you heard?

58:45.455 --> 58:47.457
Vincent, I mean, Vinny,

58:47.457 --> 58:49.026
has been hanging out in Little
Italy

58:49.026 --> 58:50.695
acting like a guido.

58:50.695 --> 58:52.129
- Is that true, Vincent?

58:52.129 --> 58:54.031
Did you act like a gui-do?

58:54.031 --> 58:55.299
- No, not like a guido.

58:55.299 --> 58:56.366
- Mm-hmm.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.968
You know everybody has
been talking about it and

58:57.968 --> 59:00.037
that like he's trying to get
with this girl who goes around

59:00.037 --> 59:03.207
and tried to steal some
cheese from the deli?

59:03.207 --> 59:05.643
- It wasn't stealing anything.

59:05.643 --> 59:06.476
- May!

59:08.846 --> 59:13.483
I can't believe May would
just walk out like that.

59:13.483 --> 59:15.820
(May sniffles)

59:15.820 --> 59:16.654
- May.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.358
Forget about that.

59:21.358 --> 59:23.493
Tonight is about you.

59:23.493 --> 59:25.495
It's your special night.

59:27.564 --> 59:30.034
- I have loved you my
entire life, Vincent.

59:30.034 --> 59:32.870
I always thought if I waited
long enough, you would

59:32.870 --> 59:35.205
recognize you have feelings r
me, too.

59:35.205 --> 59:37.407
Have I only wasted my time?

59:38.909 --> 59:39.844
- I just never thought-

59:39.844 --> 59:42.212
- That's just it, Vincent.

59:42.212 --> 59:44.181
Why do you think I'm always at
your house?

59:44.181 --> 59:47.885
I'm there to see you,
to spend time with you.

59:50.755 --> 59:52.589
We had so many moments, yet,

59:52.589 --> 59:55.025
you have been oblivious to tm
all.

59:55.025 --> 59:56.360
That's not true.

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:04.201
- Chow, what's wrong
with that son of yours?

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.770
- Uh, you should love him.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:08.372
He doesn't act Chinese.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:11.408
- Vincent, listen carefully,

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:13.377
Hung-Phat is looking for you.

01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:15.079
And it's serious.

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:17.414
- A few cans, that's all there
was.

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:21.551
(speaking foreign language)

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.253
- Apologize to him

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:27.091
he may crush your bones,
but at least you'll live.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.894
(speaking foreign language)

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:32.730
I'll be watching from the
shadows.

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:42.707
- Look, ma.

01:00:42.707 --> 01:00:44.241
Look what that cute Chinese y
gave me.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.075
- Who?

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:47.077
That delivery boy from the other
day?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:47.912
(scoffing)

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:49.914
He doesn't stand a chance with
you.

01:00:49.914 --> 01:00:51.581
- You never know.

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:52.416
- What is it?

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:53.951
You don't like Italians anymore?

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:54.785
What?

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:55.619
You like Chinese now?

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:56.453
- You know, ma?

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:59.256
Race has got nothing to do wh
it

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:02.927
- Stop already.

01:01:02.927 --> 01:01:04.128
- I think it's cute, I think
it's little, it's cute.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:05.129
It's very small.

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:05.963
It's cute.

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:11.435
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.656
- [Vinny] Hung-Phat was coming
for me.

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:34.358
Tina started liking me.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:37.127
May is mad at me, and my
parents are threatened.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:40.130
It's no wonder I ended up in
trouble.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:44.034
- Oh, we're gonna see about
that, honey.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.803
Well, hello, Vincent.

01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:48.638
Hmm?

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:51.475
- I think I'm being followed.

01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:52.509
- Things didn't go well?

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:53.978
- I hardly placed any cans.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:55.846
It's like the Chinese
don't speak my language.

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:57.314
(loud banging)

01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:00.150
- Okay, enough of this dumbness.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.485
What gives?

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:02.519
- I'm trying to distribute the
mob's

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:04.989
Italian olive oil in Chinato.

01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:06.656
I'm supposed to explain myself
to Triads

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.558
who found out but now are
following me Wait, wait.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.160
- The mob?

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:10.995
The triad?

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.397
Okay, look,

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:16.733
I am not one to judge
a lifestyle but damn!

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.003
This is some crazy shit!

01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:20.871
- I don't want to face
Chinese water torture.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.672
I don't want to wear cement
boots, either.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.509
- I told you family life was
dangerous.

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:27.411
You gotta lay low today.

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.712
After brunch.

01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:33.350
embraces their role, the
- Vincenaudiencethe actor

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.219
just can't resist.

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.253
They're hooked.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.355
- Yeah, Vin, you gotta
walk it like you talk it.

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:39.890
And, you better speed walk it,

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.525
or we're all gonna be in deep
shit.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:42.392
- I'm not gonna be in deep shit.

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:44.028
- We're gonna be in deep shit.

01:02:44.028 --> 01:02:45.395
- Okay.
- Right.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:46.864
I've come this far.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.432
No turning back.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.734
Time to play the main guy ro.

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:51.902
No more eating rice.

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:52.736
- Mmm.

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:53.570
Testify, little brother.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.539
- No more eating egg rolls.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:58.042
- Embrace the wise guy within.

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:09.053
- Forget about it.

01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.288
It's like if you agree
with someone, you know?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.558
Like Scarlett Johansson's
one great piece of ass.

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.460
Forget about it.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.228
It also can mean "go to hell,"
too.

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:19.429
Like, "Hey, Paulie.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.597
You got a one-inch pepper."

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.066
- Oh.

01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:25.302
- But sometimes it just
means "forget about it."

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.636
(claps)

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.272
- Bravo, Vinny.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.406
Bravo.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.440
Forget about it!

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.910
- [All] Forget about it!

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.579
- You know what you wanna order?

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:39.283
Never a knife when you need one.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.586
Thank you.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:43.787
- Vincent Chow!

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:47.757
(yelling)

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:50.260
(disco music)

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:53.630
- I got this.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.439
(shouting)

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.786
- Should have never
invited you out to brunch.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.956
(screams)

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:26.663
(screaming)

01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:41.345
(grunting)

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:44.814
- No turning back.

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:49.653
- Freeze.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.156
(grunting)

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:53.657
- Forget about it!

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.995
(upbeat dance music)

01:05:01.165 --> 01:05:03.500
- Time's running out, Mr. Vinny.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.035
- I'm Special Agent Johnson.

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:08.672
And this is my partner,
Special Agent Johnson.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:09.673
- Oh, that's cute.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:11.575
Like, uh, Johnson and Johnson.

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:13.077
I love the baby oil.

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:15.245
- We prefer "The Two Johnson"

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.580
- Ooh.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.514
Double Dutch fudge.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:19.183
Double, double Dutch fudge.

01:05:19.183 --> 01:05:22.352
- We're from the Department
of Food Safety and Hygiene.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:24.554
- Is that a real thing?

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:27.857
- It's been a rough couple of
weeks, hasn't it, Mr. Chung?

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.026
- Oh, oh, uh, I told him.

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:30.694
I told him it would be a bad
idea.

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:33.863
- That was some crazy ass trd
shit.

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.065
- And I know that Mr. Lawrence

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:37.567
your martial arts skills are
pretty good.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:38.735
- Well, you know.

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.204
(laughing)

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:42.206
I'm just trying to uphold the
long line

01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:44.208
of Black Martial Arts heroes.

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.910
- Like Ron Van Clief, The Blk
Dragon?

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.578
- Jim Kelly in "Enter the
Dragon"

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:50.214
and as "Black Belt Jones."

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:51.381
- Wesley Snipes in "Blade."

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:52.382
- Oh, oh.

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.285
And, Eddie Griffin in
"Undercover Brother."

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.220
- Oh, Jeez.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.054
- What?

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.788
It's a good film.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.457
- Mr. Ching, we have been
tracking food

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.760
and spice distribution
syndicate of the New York mob.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.129
And we are well aware of your
interactions

01:06:05.129 --> 01:06:07.464
with Capella and Condimento.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.233
- Commissioner O'Greedy has
joined forces with the evil

01:06:09.233 --> 01:06:10.734
triad leader Hung Phat

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:12.436
to take over Little Italy.

01:06:12.436 --> 01:06:14.138
- And thanks to your olive oil
fiasco,

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:16.573
Hung-Phat is looking for you.

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:19.943
- I was just trying to extort
some cash and distribute

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:22.112
some olive oil cans.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.248
And what is with this ching
chong?

01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:25.915
My last name is Chow!

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:26.883
- Sorry.

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:28.452
We got you confused with the
other Korean

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.454
gentlemen we are tailing.

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:32.089
- That's racist.

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:34.324
I'm not Korean, I'm Chinese.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.925
- I thought you were Italian.

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.294
- Only in his mind.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.495
- You're not helping.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:39.829
- I'm just saying.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.765
- Gentlemen, concentrate!

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:44.668
Condimento set you up
to fall like soufflÃ©.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:48.838
Your friends, your family,
they're all in danger.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:51.108
We believe we may have a way out
for you.

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:54.144
And, we believe you have the
motivation to pull this off.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:55.779
- Yes.

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:58.448
Anything to protect my family
and friends.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:06:59.783
- Good.

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.017
Vincenzo Cento,

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.654
the Sicilian Don of all Dons
will be arriving in New York

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:07.991
to broker peace between
Condimento and Capella.

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:10.460
- That's where you come in Mr.
Chow.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.528
- What?

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:12.862
- We need that ledgers showing
where

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.131
they get their products,

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:16.800
how they store it, and what
the real expiration dates are,

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.635
and everybody involved.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:21.305
We need all this stuff to nail
these guys.

01:07:21.305 --> 01:07:23.140
- What does that have to with
me?

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.809
- We need you to go undercov,

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.511
deep undercover.

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:28.978
Infiltrate the mob

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:30.547
and get those ledgers.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.817
- We need you to impersonate the
Don.

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:35.219
- No way.

01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:36.653
I've seen the movies.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.822
You go in alive and you come out
dead.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:41.991
And it's usually your
best friend who does it.

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:44.661
I don't want to put Joey
through that pressure.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:45.695
(sobbing)

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:47.531
- I appreciate that.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.333
- I couldn't even extort
provolone.

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:51.201
And, I don't even look Itali.

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:54.338
- A white guy played Charlie
Chan, I believed him.

01:07:54.338 --> 01:07:55.839
- Charlie Chan is white guy?

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.341
- Besides, no one's seen the
don.

01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:59.075
There is not one photo of him.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.911
- And your friend, Lawrence
here is pretty good with makeup.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.581
He can actually make
you look like the Don.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:05.682
- Oh.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:06.550
Oh, oh.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.917
Hell no.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:08.752
No.

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:11.521
That shit ain't gonna work.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:12.689
- Thanks, Lawrence.

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.023
- Well?

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.259
- The Johnsons are right,
though.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:18.694
This is the only way we can x
it.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.863
What would Shakespeare do?

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:27.237
- Though this be madness.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:29.538
Yet there is method in it.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.408
Aw, what the hell?

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:34.377
Besides, I might like me an
Italian guy to rough me up.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.444
Mm-hmm.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.381
I'm looking at you, Vinny Ch.

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:39.416
- Okay, gentlemen.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.551
So, we have an agreement?

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:44.388
- Yeah.

01:08:44.388 --> 01:08:45.255
- Excellent.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:46.089
- Good.

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:47.557
- Let's do it.
-Whoa, woah!

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:49.959
Charlie Chan is a white guy?

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.899
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.908
- This is the big moment to be
the don.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:08.412
It's do

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:10.113
or die.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.322
We've never met.

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.758
We've known each other
many years but this is the

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:25.595
first time you came to
me for counsel, for help.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.331
- Godfather, if I must say,

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:30.600
we are so grateful for your
counsel.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.602
It's truly our loss
that you are so far away

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:34.770
in the old country.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.606
- How did this happen?

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:38.341
A rivalry within the family?

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:42.279
- Hey, I sell the spices and the
herbs.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:46.450
But this greedy Al Capella,
he's like a little baby boy o

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.652
wants all the candy for himself.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:51.955
Look, product out big, profit in
small,

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.023
invoices from Brooklyn paid,

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.860
invoices from Manhattan, not
paid.

01:09:58.962 --> 01:09:59.963
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:01.798
You're giving me a lot
of answers but you're

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:04.133
not giving me the right ones.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.935
- I gotta say, boss,

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:07.003
I think the Don is right.

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:08.538
I think we should cooperate.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.839
- Yeah, well, this bum is full

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:11.140
of shit because he's taken way

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.310
more than he deserves from the
back-end.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.478
You wanna see?

01:10:14.478 --> 01:10:15.312
Here, Godfather.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:16.813
Excuse me.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.482
Take a look at this.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:25.989
I'd like to run this bum outf
town,

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.524
but you know what would happ?

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:30.994
The Chinese would detect that
we got weakness in the family.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:33.497
And then they run in right
away with their gingers and

01:10:33.497 --> 01:10:34.898
their spices.

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.666
Five spices, in fact!

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:40.337
- How about them moo shu
pancakes, huh?

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.905
Fluffy, am I right?

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:42.839
- Fluffy?

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:43.673
Moo shu?

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:45.342
- Forget about it.
- Fluffy.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:46.843
Moo shu pancake?

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:50.847
- There's nothing quite
like a good pasta and sauce.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:51.848
- Pasta?

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:53.082
Who calls it pasta?

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.184
- There's spaghetti and thers
macaroni.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.185
Forget about it.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.854
- This tastes like freaking
cardboard.

01:10:57.854 --> 01:10:59.723
Do me a favor sweetheart,
get the box, huh.

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:01.391
Let me look at this.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.061
Marco Polo, what is this shit?

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.730
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:07.597
Ramen King?

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:08.532
Do you believe this?

01:11:08.532 --> 01:11:10.033
Get it outta here!

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.370
- [Man] I knew it, I knew it.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:14.604
He's a fake!

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:15.939
- [Man] It's that wannabe, Vinny
Chow.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:16.773
Get him.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.608
- [Man] Let's get him.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.379
(suspenseful music)

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:24.881
(grunting)

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:28.618
(bottle shattering)
- Oooooh!

01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:32.722
(grunting)

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:40.630
- Get him!

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:55.278
He's working for the Triads.

01:11:55.278 --> 01:11:56.112
I knew it.

01:11:57.414 --> 01:11:59.148
- I thought nobody makes a fl
of Capella

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.917
and gets away with it?

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:03.587
- Get on line, pal, 'cause
he's got you on ledger, too.

01:12:03.587 --> 01:12:04.421
- What?

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:05.755
Get the Chinaman!

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.256
- [Man] We'll go to the
mattresses.

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.324
- That's it, I'm calling Luca.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.093
- He's calling Luca?

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:12.829
He's calling Luca Fajioli!

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:15.432
(grunting)

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:17.434
(phone rings)

01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:18.668
- Hang on.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.337
You just got lucky, wait 'til
round two.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.171
Yeah?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.440
- Hey, Luc.
- Oh, boss.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.674
- Do me a favor, huh?

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.776
Get the stilettos, the guns,
the knives, whatever you got.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.678
And bring them down here.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.448
And I want you to grab
Johnny T, Produce Joe,

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.449
Donny the Baker,

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:33.850
and Salame the Deli Man.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:34.684
All right?

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:35.619
- The Deli Man?

01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:36.953
What's that fat rat bastard
going to do?

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:37.787
Sit on them?

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:38.788
(laughing)

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:39.623
- We need manpower.

01:12:39.623 --> 01:12:40.624
Shut up.

01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:42.592
- Ask him to call up the
rest of my guys here.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.793
I got, I got no service here.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.261
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, ye.

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:46.295
And do me a favor,

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.297
call up Condimento's
garlic goombas, all right.

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.199
This idiot forgot to
charge his phone again.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.668
- Whoa, whoa.
- What else is new?

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:53.803
I had a busy day, I ain't got
no time to charge a phone.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:57.373
- Yeah, you're probably
callin' the broads.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:02.311
(grunting)

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:08.351
(clapping)

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.223
(grunting)

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.992
- [Vinny] What was that?

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.994
- The sound of one hand
clapping.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:20.229
(laughing)

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.667
- Three against one?

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:26.335
- You're a very clever young
man.

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:30.006
(speaking foreign language)

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:36.746
- I wasn't really working for
them.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.347
- Bullshit.

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:40.717
- It was just a trial.

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:41.551
- Trial?

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:43.419
Oh yeah.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:53.697
(speaking foreign language)

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:57.066
- I was just trying to impress
a girl, get some respect and

01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:58.535
make a little money.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:01.705
You of all people should
understand that.

01:14:01.705 --> 01:14:02.539
- Wrong.

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:06.109
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:08.377
(grunting)

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:12.248
(groaning)

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:14.751
No one gets made in Chinatown.

01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:16.720
- Hung Phat!

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.391
(grunting)

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.229
- Vincent!

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.764
(phone ringing)

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.432
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:30.266
What?

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:33.937
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:40.143
(grunting)

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.578
- [Sifu] May, are you okay?

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:42.411
- [May] Forget about me.

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:43.312
What about Vincent?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.749
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:46.650
- Break us free.

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:48.151
These ropes are thick, I'm tiny.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.786
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:51.087
- You think I'm fat?

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.456
Is that why Vincent doesn't
like me because I'm fat?

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:56.926
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.928
- You guys got problems.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.267
- You okay?

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:07.837
(speaking foreign language)

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:10.807
- There's no time.

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.508
I have to get Hung-Phat's
ledger.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.611
(speaking foreign language)

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:15.779
- Get that to the agents.

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:17.614
I'm going to Hung-Phat's
warehouse.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:18.648
Call Lawrence.

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:19.482
Sifu, let's go.

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:20.316
- Hai!

01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:28.457
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:15:46.509 --> 01:15:49.145
(Hung taps on table)

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:53.016
(suspenseful orchestral music)

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.221
(speaking foreign language)

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:07.530
- Oh, there's that wanna
be Chinese wise guy.

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:08.364
Get him!

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.499
(speaking foreign language)

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:13.036
(all shouting)

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:16.239
- You know what?

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.573
We're too old for this.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:18.407
- You ain't kidding.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:19.242
My back is killing me.

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:20.343
Let's go sit down.

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:21.711
- You got sciatica or something?

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:22.846
- I got something, I don't know.

01:16:22.846 --> 01:16:23.680
My leg is hurting.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.848
- Well I know this masseuse.

01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:25.682
You know?

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:26.515
- Yeah?

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:27.684
- Does she do happy ending?

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:28.584
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.690
(grunting)

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.461
- [May] Vincent!

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:48.131
(heart beating)

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:53.469
Vincent!

01:17:57.941 --> 01:17:58.775
Vincent!

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.180
(all shouting)

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:18.461
(grunting)

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:21.330
(groans)

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:23.699
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.969
(grunting)

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.843
(suspenseful music)

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:44.153
(bones breaking)

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:05.408
(grunting)

01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:33.870
- Look at the way they fight.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:35.238
They don't fight like we used
to.

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:36.072
- Yeah.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:36.906
I taught you everything you
know.

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:37.740
- Yeah, I know.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.075
You taught me the
one-five-one-five.

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:40.209
Two, three, and four I got.

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:41.377
Thanks a lot.

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:42.211
- May.

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:43.947
May.

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:47.884
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:48.717
May.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.255
Are you okay?

01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:55.925
- I'm okay.

01:19:58.962 --> 01:20:01.130
(sighing)

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.240
- Good job, officers.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:16.245
I have Intel that'll put
these gangsters away for life.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.914
I'm on your side.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.450
That damn Vincent Chow.

01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:22.919
He can say, "forget about it"

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.820
just not in Chinese.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.825
His mom sent him out for lo
mein, he came back with penne.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:31.427
- What the hell is going on?

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:32.595
- What's this?

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:35.164
- You played me like a puppet.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.100
- Yeah, it was a good plan, too,
huh?

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:37.934
Am I right?

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:38.902
Am I right?

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:40.603
- What do you think of me now
Mr. Capella?

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:43.172
- You surprised us all, you
freaking rat.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:44.173
You'll get yours.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:47.476
- What do you got, shoe
polish on your eye?

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.512
- Come on, don't be so rough,
huh?

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:50.346
Can I get a soda?

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.281
Come on, I feel a little
parched.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:54.483
(laughing)

01:21:03.826 --> 01:21:07.130
- Mr. Chow, couple of questis
for you.

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:10.133
- I'll meet you outside in a
minute.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.139
- Wow, Vin.

01:21:16.139 --> 01:21:18.307
You're even more powerful than
the mob.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:20.043
A girl could really
have a future connected

01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:21.477
to a guy like you.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.159
I always lose the good ones.

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:47.336
(dramatic piano music)

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.377
- [Vinny] Now, do you see my
problem?

01:21:54.377 --> 01:21:56.679
- Oh-ho, you got a problem!

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.349
- Okay, let's see if we got
this.

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:02.051
Uh, you a Chinese guy

01:22:02.051 --> 01:22:05.221
who seek out a gay black man and
turn you

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.356
into an Italian wise guy?

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:09.192
- You like a girl who has no

01:22:09.192 --> 01:22:11.394
interest in who you are.

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:13.529
But, she's Italian

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:15.431
and has nice body.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.700
- And, another girl who
likes you for who you are,

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.936
but you no interested in
her because she is Chinese.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.939
- You dismiss your Chinese
family and culture.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:27.876
And your only friend is
Italian boy who is now Mexic.

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:30.046
- And you managed to
get the Italian and the

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:32.781
Chinese mafia trying to kill
you.

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.085
- [Both] Forget about it!

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:37.786
- And yet,

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.889
in the end, you foiled them

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.791
and become a hero.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.761
- And now, you're in love.

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:47.730
- Did we miss anything?

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:49.798
- No, but when you put it that
way,

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.400
it just sounds so unhealthy.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.235
- Unhealthy, yes.

01:22:52.235 --> 01:22:53.802
But understandable.

01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:58.574
- I was just looking
for acceptance, respect,

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:00.243
and the love of a woman.

01:23:00.243 --> 01:23:02.478
- And you achieved all that.

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:04.280
Not from intimidation,

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.084
but while being selfless
and helping others.

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:10.619
- But May saw Tina kiss me and
ran off.

01:23:10.619 --> 01:23:11.987
I've lost her.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.656
- You have not lost her.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:16.759
She's waiting for you to come to
her.

01:23:19.262 --> 01:23:20.829
Forget what we say.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.833
Wisdom and knowledge is within
you.

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.003
- Go!

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.273
Go get the girl.

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:35.844
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:43.352
- I couldn't reach May.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:47.123
I called, left her messages,
texts, and social media posts.

01:23:47.123 --> 01:23:51.160
She finally texted me to
meet her on the rooftop.

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:53.496
May.

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:59.202
I wanted to thank you for
everything

01:23:59.202 --> 01:24:01.137
and that I've been a real je.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:03.672
- Yes, you have been.

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:06.709
- Look, I came all the way
from Columbus Park to tell you

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:08.977
that you're charismatic,

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:09.812
beautiful,

01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:13.316
and that I wanna be with you.

01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:15.651
- How about Tina?

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:16.519
How about the mob?

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:17.553
- Forget all that.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:21.224
I was misled and now I
know who I really am.

01:24:22.358 --> 01:24:24.860
Look, I want you to have this.

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:27.996
- Are you kidding me?

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.166
I would never accept a recycd
gift.

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:32.401
When you understand that,
you can get a girl like me.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:35.704
- May, I'm trying my best to
tell you

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:37.840
that I love you.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.044
- You're not a very
well-put-together guy, Vince.

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:46.515
- Look, a guy's gotta look
out for his own future.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:48.384
And I want you in mine.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:52.521
Here's your real gift, May

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.923
My grandmother's jade Buddha.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.928
- It's, it's precious.

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:04.200
(wind chimes ringing)

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:16.379
- [Vinny] You know, we
could make a big family

01:25:16.379 --> 01:25:19.382
and start our own La Famiglia.

01:25:19.382 --> 01:25:20.716
And, take over lower Manhatt.

01:25:20.716 --> 01:25:22.551
Better yet, maybe we move down
to Philly

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:25.221
and infiltrate the cheese stk
business.

01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:27.055
Nah, forget about it!

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.056
(upbeat jazz music)

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:30.626
* I didn't see you coming

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:34.430
* Until it was too late

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.633
* I didn't see you coming

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:41.437
* I thought I'd have to wait

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:44.440
* I didn't see you coming

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.910
* I thought I would be blue

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:52.915
* Because, baby, I never
expected you *

01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:58.787
* I didn't know what hit me

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:02.425
* Until I hit the ground

01:26:02.425 --> 01:26:05.928
* I didn't know what hit me

01:26:05.928 --> 01:26:10.098
* I didn't make a sound

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:13.168
* I didn't know what hit me

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.272
* You shook me through and
through *

01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:21.277
* Because, baby, I never
expected you *

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:28.684
* I never expected to
feel this way again *

01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:34.490
* But it seems we've
met and kissed before *

01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:37.526
* Although I can not tell
exactly where or when *

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:40.963
* I never knew the magic

01:26:40.963 --> 01:26:44.700
* A single kiss could give

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.036
* I never knew your magic

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:51.640
* Would make my poor heart le
*

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.977
* I never knew the magic

01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:58.314
* That only you could do

01:26:58.314 --> 01:27:02.818
* Because, baby, I never
expected you *

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:08.216
* I never expected to
feel this way again *

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:13.789
* But it seems we've
met and kissed before *

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:17.560
* Although I can not tell
exactly where or when *

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.963
* I never knew the magic

01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:23.732
* A single kiss could do

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:27.736
* Oh, I never knew your magic

01:28:27.736 --> 01:28:31.407
* Would make my poor heart le
*

01:28:31.407 --> 01:28:34.577
* I never knew the magic

01:28:34.577 --> 01:28:38.113
* That only you could do

01:28:38.113 --> 01:28:43.118
* Because, baby, I never
expected you *

01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:50.426
* Because, baby, I never
expected you *

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:55.764
* Because, baby

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:58.967
* I never expected you

01:29:00.135 --> 01:29:02.438
(laughing)
