WEBVTT

00:14.110 --> 00:17.273
( car door opens and closes )

00:21.320 --> 00:23.242
Too Sweet?

00:27.090 --> 00:29.479
I smell something bad,
Miss Nova.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.486
Hush. Hush.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.468
Where have you been?

00:37.800 --> 00:40.439
I was downtown
around the mI55|on

00:40.470 --> 00:42.233
when I heard you and Rid
was looking for me.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.532
Why didn't you
come back?

00:43.570 --> 00:45.435
All of us were worried sick.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.675
You done enough for me,
Miss Nova.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.148
Nova: _
You stay here tonight.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.284
For as long as you need to.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.584
Okay, we'll figure
things out.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.829
( music playing )

01:06.860 --> 01:08.452
* Dreams never die

01:08.500 --> 01:10.695
* Take flight
as the world turns *

01:10.730 --> 01:12.266
* Dreams never die

01:12.300 --> 01:14.768
* Take flight
as the world turns *

01:14.800 --> 01:16.506
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:16.540 --> 01:18.701
* Take flight

01:18.740 --> 01:20.708
* Dreams never die

01:26.280 --> 01:29.579
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

01:29.620 --> 01:33.158
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

01:34.790 --> 01:36.451
Okay, so how was it?

01:36.490 --> 01:39.459
The hippos were so big,
and then we saw the baby lions.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.469
They're called cubs.
Put your arms in.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.469
One hand at a time.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.832
Now, out of all
of the animals,

01:47.870 --> 01:49.508
which one _
was your favorite?

01:49.540 --> 01:50.632
The monkeys.

01:50.670 --> 01:51.762
( gasps )

01:51.810 --> 01:53.402
Mine, too.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.203
So, now we're going
to put your shoes on

01:55.240 --> 01:56.878
then we're going
to go to school.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.468
But I don't want to go.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.738
Why not?

01:59.780 --> 02:01.668
Jamal's been
pushing me at recess.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.342
Did you tell your teacher?

02:04.390 --> 02:06.415
I tried, but he tripped me.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.519
He said he's going
to beat me up.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.618
Okay, stand up.

02:14.660 --> 02:17.891
The next time
Jamal touches you,
you defend yourself.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.535
- But he's bigger than me.
- Even better,

02:20.570 --> 02:22.561
_ because all it takes
IS one Jab under hIS nose,
and he'll stop.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.736
You sure?

02:23.770 --> 02:25.328
Yes. Come on, come on.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.406
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left. Right, left.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.340
Okay, now duck.
Big swing.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.905
Jab, jab, jab.
That's good.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.372
- Right in the nose.
- Ralph: Blue.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.240
Y'all running late
for school.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.339
( both laughing )

02:38.720 --> 02:40.210
A kid's messing
with Blue.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.684
Mom's teaching me
how to defend myself.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.550
No.

02:45.590 --> 02:48.798
No, that's all wrong.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.366
You got to come at him
from the side...

02:50.400 --> 02:51.822
- ...so he don't see you coming.
- Darla: What?!

02:51.870 --> 02:53.565
- ( Blue laughs)
- ( all chattering )

03:01.840 --> 03:03.273
All right, buddy.

03:03.310 --> 03:06.643
I got pancakes
in the kitchen.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.319
Let's eat up so your mama
can take you to school.

03:09.350 --> 03:10.908
Okay.

03:10.950 --> 03:13.350
- Come on. Running late.
- Whee!

03:18.730 --> 03:20.618
Come on, Blue.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.277
Newscaster over TV:
Well, the Gladiators struggled

03:36.310 --> 03:37.641
down the homestretch
without Davis West

03:37.680 --> 03:38.908
during his suspension.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.339
Now, the Gladiators
were hoping to re-sign West,

03:41.380 --> 03:42.540
but in a surprise move,

03:42.590 --> 03:44.319
he opted to leave
the Gladiators,

03:44.350 --> 03:48.252
joining Felix Evans
as a free agent.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.349
Now, in his 16-year career...

03:50.390 --> 03:52.449
- Good morning, baby.
- Good morning.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.627
They still talking
about Dad?

03:54.660 --> 03:57.561
They've just announced
he's leaving the Gladiators.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.862
(turns TV off)

04:00.370 --> 04:02.907
Hey, did you put this
on my bed this morning?

04:02.940 --> 04:04.009
Yes.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.530
( laughs )

04:05.570 --> 04:07.037
It's an invitation
for the new parents luncheon

04:07.080 --> 04:08.479
at Gardini Prep tomorrow.

04:08.510 --> 04:09.909
- So, that means I got in.
- Mm-hmm.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.804
- That means I got in.
- Yes, you did.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.772
( both laugh )

04:13.820 --> 04:17.483
But I thought you and Dad were
supposed to go to the school.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.612
Not anymore.

04:18.650 --> 04:21.357
Your father made
a large donation.

04:21.390 --> 04:24.780
So, he's not coming
back down anymore, is he?

04:24.830 --> 04:28.596
I couldn't tell you what
your father is or isn't doing.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.491
( cell phone rings )

04:31.530 --> 04:33.339
Who's calling you
this early?

04:33.370 --> 04:34.894
Oh, it's probably
the Knicks.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.635
Teams have been
calling all morning.

04:36.670 --> 04:40.037
Everybody wants to know
where your dad's
going to end up.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.378
But I thought Miriam
handled all of that business.

04:42.410 --> 04:46.449
Yeah, but they're all
used to dealing with me, so...

04:56.790 --> 04:58.052
I'm going to get ready.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.921
I told Keke I would
walk her to school.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.621
You're walking her
to school?

05:01.660 --> 05:02.991
What's going on with you
and that girl?

05:03.030 --> 05:04.622
- Oh, my God. Nothing.
- Uh-huh.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.537
- We're just friends.
- Okay. Yeah.

05:07.570 --> 05:10.334
Well, keep your phone
on you.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.528
Hey, Clive.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.726
Can't barely
recognize my own diner.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.490
That's good.
And when we re-open tomorrow,

05:37.530 --> 05:39.088
this place is going to be
the turn-up spot

05:39.130 --> 05:41.530
come Friday
and Saturday nights.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.961
Oh, hey. Come on.
Take that to the back.

05:46.010 --> 05:47.898
Wait, is that hard liquor?

05:47.940 --> 05:49.669
It ain't soft.

05:49.710 --> 05:52.747
We don't serve hard liquor
at the High Yellow,
or any liquor.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.874
Clive, we have been over this.
We're barely breaking even.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.639
Two nights a week.
A little music,
little dancing.

05:58.690 --> 06:01.056
Before you know it,
you're back in the black.

06:01.090 --> 06:04.480
But my church group
be coming in here.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.953
Well, they know Jesus
turned water into wine.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.394
Morning, everybody.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.668
- Ralph Angel: What's up?
- Hey.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.158
Okay, to recap
last week's meeting,

06:18.210 --> 06:20.701
the Landrys offered us
$4 million,

06:20.740 --> 06:23.140
but we have no intention
of takIng their money

06:23.180 --> 06:24.442
or selling our farm.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.879
They some dirty bastards.

06:25.910 --> 06:27.639
But now we have to figure out

06:27.680 --> 06:29.489
where we're grinding our cane
this season.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.613
- I thought you signed a deal.
- No.

06:31.650 --> 06:35.154
The three mills here in
St. Jo are all run by Landrys.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.953
Don't seem we have a choice.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.423
Charley:
I think we do.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.122
I found a mill
in St. James parish.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.764
Same 40/60 split.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.893
They don't offer trucks,
but we can lease those.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.763
Wait, wait, wait.
That mill's at least
16 hours away.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.131
- Charley: I know.
- Ralph: Charley,

06:49.170 --> 06:52.674
we got 300 acres
to harvest.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.769
That's 12,000 tons
of cane.

06:54.810 --> 06:59.144
We can't cut our cane and drive
it out to St. James in time.

06:59.180 --> 07:02.047
Our sugar's going
to crystallize.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.980
We could lose
the whole crop.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.079
True.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.213
But at least the mill
in St. James

07:08.260 --> 07:10.888
isn't run by a family
that owned our family.

07:14.230 --> 07:15.788
Remy: Hmm.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.466
( sighs )

07:19.500 --> 07:21.866
All right, y'all will
be cutting it close,

07:21.900 --> 07:24.505
but it ain't impossible.

07:24.540 --> 07:28.738
Between leasing those trucks,
fueling those trucks

07:28.780 --> 07:30.509
and then paying workers
for 80 days of harvest,

07:30.550 --> 07:32.040
this is going
to get expensive.

07:33.850 --> 07:36.785
I think it's time for
y'all to get a farm loan.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.879
Charley's been bankrolling
the costs thus far.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.980
Yeah, I don't know if we need
a loan to have to pay back.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.822
Charley:
We do.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.589
I filed for divorce,

07:46.630 --> 07:48.655
and my attorney's
advised me

07:48.700 --> 07:50.668
_ _ not to access _
my jomt accounts With DaVIs

07:50.700 --> 07:53.168
until our divorce
is finalized.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.997
Damn, Charley.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.677
Good for you.

08:11.990 --> 08:16.108
Look, if you want,
I'll reach out to a
crop adVIsor.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.718
Have him come out to the farm
and assess the value

08:17.760 --> 08:19.125
of this year's harvest.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.696
He'll submit an estimate
to the bank,

08:20.730 --> 08:22.129
and then he'll also
let you know

08:22.160 --> 08:23.661
what you'll probably
be approved for.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.090
So, that shouldn't
be a problem.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.131
All right,
I got to get back.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.076
Remy, let me know
what I need to do.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.702
- Will do.
- All right.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.169
Sis, see you later.

08:39.210 --> 08:40.643
Yeah.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.681
You want me
to stick around?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.187
I'm on a deadline,
but I can be here.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.756
I'm okay.

08:48.790 --> 08:49.859
Okay.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.091
Bye.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.199
Bye.

08:59.230 --> 09:00.663
( chuckles )

09:07.080 --> 09:08.775
( door closes )

09:17.220 --> 09:18.744
You're not going
to say anything?

09:18.790 --> 09:21.714
I'm trying
to be respectful.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.691
But I know
what I want to say.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.084
( hip-hop playing
over headphones )

10:01.430 --> 10:03.022
( door closes )

10:06.700 --> 10:08.998
Micah.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.807
I should go.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.330
Micah, you don't
understand.

10:41.370 --> 10:43.907
No, I think I understand.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.932
Micah, just listen.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.299
Stop.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.440
Baby, I'm sorry.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.347
How could you
move on so fast?

10:58.390 --> 11:03.885
You know it's over
for your dad and me.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.728
Did you ever love him,
or was it all just for show?

11:08.130 --> 11:10.189
What do you mean?

11:10.230 --> 11:12.425
Of course.
Of course I loved him.

11:12.470 --> 11:13.732
Whatever.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.294
Now he's out sleeping
with hookers,

11:15.340 --> 11:18.707
and you decide, "I'm going
to kiss some other guy."

11:21.080 --> 11:23.048
- Baby--
- It doesn't even matter.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.900
I don't care anymore.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.349
Micah, baby...

11:28.220 --> 11:30.245
Micah...

11:42.970 --> 11:44.119
( school bell rings )

11:44.170 --> 11:45.364
- So you got your lunch?
- Yes.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.493
Okay. Are you going to have
a Blue day today?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.893
( laughs )

11:48.940 --> 11:50.339
Pop says that.

11:50.370 --> 11:53.806
Well, I'm borrowing it.
Here, let me take a look at you.

11:53.840 --> 11:54.932
Can I have a hug?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.129
Bye, Mommy.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.909
I love you.

11:59.110 --> 12:00.714
I love you more.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.210
Good morning,
Mr. Bordelon.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.342
Morning, Miss Velez.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.743
- Reyna: How you doing?
- Good.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.348
- You ready?
- Blue: Mm-hmm.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.881
Reyna Velez.
We haven't met.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.454
Darla.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.890
There was a sub here
the last time I dropped
Blue off.

12:13.930 --> 12:16.455
Ah. I didn't know that
Ralph Angel got a babysitter.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.867
I'm Blue's mom.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.234
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

12:21.270 --> 12:22.965
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

12:23.010 --> 12:27.106
You know, I have a lot of
drawings that Blue did of you.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.472
He can't stop
talking about you.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.501
I talk about him
all the time, too.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.370
Yeah. I can imagine that.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.289
So there's-- Blue says
there's a boy named Jamal

12:39.090 --> 12:40.250
Are you aware of this?

12:40.290 --> 12:41.518
I'm not.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.289
He hasn‘t mentioned
anything to me,

12:43.330 --> 12:45.321
and I haven't observed
any behavior like that.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.852
Well, he told me.
And I believe him.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.128
Right. Of course.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.967
I'll keep a look out.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.391
Listen, I know that
you have Miss Violet

12:56.440 --> 12:58.328
in Ralph Angel's
contact information,

12:58.370 --> 13:01.134
but if anything happens
with Blue,

13:01.180 --> 13:03.068
can you keep me
informed too?

13:05.910 --> 13:07.116
Of course.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.447
Thank you.

13:16.590 --> 13:21.027
* I shouldn't say
what I say *

13:21.060 --> 13:23.096
( knock on door)

13:30.010 --> 13:31.363
You alone?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.571
Yeah. Too Sweet
stepped out.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.805
Charley, what's wrong?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.339
What's wrong?

13:38.380 --> 13:40.143
Is it Micah? Aunt Vi?

13:40.180 --> 13:41.374
No, it's me.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.884
You going to tell me
what's going on?

13:52.960 --> 13:54.598
I kissed Remy.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.594
And Micah...

13:59.630 --> 14:02.929
Micah walked in
and saw us.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.632
- I made a mistake.
- Nova: You made a choice.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.070
You're not getting cold feet
about divorcing Davis, are you?

14:08.110 --> 14:09.998
No.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.419
No, that I have to do.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.287
It wasn't the first time
we kissed.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.652
Remy's a good man.

14:20.690 --> 14:24.228
Ain't nobody going to fault you
for wanting a good man.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.399
( sighs )

14:29.430 --> 14:31.261
Eighteen years.

14:32.670 --> 14:35.935
That's more than half my life
I spent with Davis.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.134
I've never been
With anyone else.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.307
Wait...

14:44.350 --> 14:46.648
you mean you've...

14:48.150 --> 14:49.242
- never...
- No.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.918
Senous?

14:52.290 --> 14:53.450
Not even in high school?

14:53.490 --> 14:57.119
No. I had boyfriends, but no.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.520
Wow.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.529
Well, I mean, I thought
you'd be all caught up by now.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.027
Being with a star athlete
for almost two decades.

15:06.070 --> 15:09.665
- I ain't crying for you!
- ( both laugh )

15:09.700 --> 15:12.305
Hey, you can't go falling apart
over a little kiss.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.007
I want more.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.143
I know you do.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.647
But I feel guilty.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.568
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.044
This time is for you.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.443
Micah hates me.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.515
He's 15.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.155
That's_a lot of emotional
terrain to cross at 15.

15:31.190 --> 15:32.225
Let him be.

15:33.430 --> 15:35.091
He'll come around.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.067
I'm scared.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.068
Just stay right here.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.001
I got exactly
what you need.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.285
Oshun...

16:06.330 --> 16:10.027
revels in the feel
of her body.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.194
Easy for her.
She looks amazing.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.105
Focus.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.048
To evoke Oshun,

16:23.080 --> 16:26.971
you need to build a pathway
to sensual liberation.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.050
You must be comfortable
with your nakedness.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.519
Free to make mistakes,

16:41.560 --> 16:43.790
to take risks,

16:43.830 --> 16:44.728
to fall.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.337
You must build a pathway
in feeling comfortable

16:49.370 --> 16:51.600
in your own skin.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.499
Comfortable to express
and access the power

16:55.540 --> 16:57.201
of your physical form.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.501
That smells good.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.677
- What is that?
- Nova: Silence is needed.

17:03.650 --> 17:08.383
How is this possibly
going to help anything?

17:08.420 --> 17:09.785
Close your eyes.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.424
( Nova chants
in foreign language )

17:20.700 --> 17:23.362
We are entitled
to wear the crown

17:23.410 --> 17:26.709
that awakens all pleasure.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.334
Nova:
I am asking
the Nigerian goddess

17:29.380 --> 17:32.770
to open the path
of attraction.

17:32.810 --> 17:37.179
Cleansing your spirit
inside...

17:38.550 --> 17:40.313
and out.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.288
Mother of the mirror.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.833
Mother of abundance.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.431
We sing your praise.

17:57.470 --> 18:00.132
( chants in foreign language )

18:11.520 --> 18:12.839
Charley.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.756
Be free from pain...

18:21.660 --> 18:23.264
from fear...

18:25.230 --> 18:26.367
from regret...

18:28.640 --> 18:30.301
from guilt...

18:31.770 --> 18:34.375
and from heartbreak.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.871
Be free.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.111
( sighs )

18:50.860 --> 18:52.885
( children chattering
in distance )

19:03.870 --> 19:05.201
What you doing here?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.434
Miss Velez called me.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.473
She called me, too.
Said something happened to Blue.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.340
He got into a fight with that
kid who's picking on him.

19:16.380 --> 19:17.916
- ( door closes )
- He's fine.

19:17.950 --> 19:21.681
It's the other kid
who's black and blue.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.529
Where's Jamal?

19:23.560 --> 19:24.959
Reyna:
Jamal and Blue
are at the playground

19:24.990 --> 19:26.423
with the after-care teacher.
They're fine.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.792
Kent, Jamal needed
an ice pack for his lip.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.388
So this boy puts his hands
on my son?

19:30.430 --> 19:31.624
Jamal was the _one
d0ing the teasmg.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.194
He pushed Blue.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.798
And that's reason for him
to hit my son in the face?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.535
We all need to calm down.

19:36.570 --> 19:37.764
Isn't Blue the boy
that plays with
the Barbie doll?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.266
It ain't a Barbie doll.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.504
Maybe if you bought your son
the appropriate toys,

19:40.540 --> 19:42.269
he'd fit in better
with the other boys--

19:42.310 --> 19:43.709
Ain't none of your business
what toys my son plays with.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.944
Now I see why he hit Jamal.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.414
I told Blue to defend
himself against bullies.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.418
Maybe if you taught
your son some manners,

19:49.450 --> 19:51.213
our son wouldn't have had
to hit yours.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.218
Everyone, please.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.887
Now, we have
a zero tolerance policy

19:54.920 --> 19:56.558
for bullying and violence.

19:56.590 --> 19:59.457
Now, this is a session
for conflict resolution.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.698
Now what?

20:02.730 --> 20:04.425
Talk to your sons.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.960
Encourage them
to talk to a teacher

20:06.000 --> 20:08.560
the next time that a problem
comes up in the future.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.569
And know that if a problem
does come up in the future

20:11.610 --> 20:13.430
from either
of these students,

20:13.480 --> 20:14.879
whether it's bullying
or violence

20:14.910 --> 20:16.468
we're going to be
dealing with suspension.

20:16.510 --> 20:19.377
This is a warning
for all of us.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.252
( scoffs )

20:31.560 --> 20:33.721
I'm very sorry
I didn't catch this sooner.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.897
You're dealing with
a lot of kids.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.022
That's fine.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.664
Thank you for calling me.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.528
Ralph:
Come on.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.798
( door opens )

21:01.020 --> 21:02.612
Didn't hear you
come back.

21:09.530 --> 21:12.419
Thought about what I'd do
ifI had to go back to jail.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.735
I can't do it.

21:18.970 --> 21:21.370
I won't do it.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.799
You're not going to go back
to jail, Too Sweet.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.442
Don't I have
to go to trial?

21:25.480 --> 21:27.414
I don't think they're going
to let this go to trial.

21:27.450 --> 21:29.008
They don't have
any evidence.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.642
All they had
was trumped-up charges.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.646
I've met people that have been
in and out of jail

21:32.690 --> 21:34.658
- their whole lives.
- That ain't going to be you.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.487
We going to get you
back in school.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.557
- They don't want me back.
- Then another school.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.058
But we're going
to get you a degree.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.398
Maybe it'll be a GED,

21:44.430 --> 21:46.921
but you're going
to finish high school,

21:46.970 --> 21:49.336
and then we'll look
for a college.

21:49.370 --> 21:52.339
Or whatever
you want to do.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.977
See the world.
Learn new things.

21:56.010 --> 22:00.049
There's a-- There's a whole
world out there.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.719
And a whole world in here.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.615
And a whole world here.

22:07.050 --> 22:11.350
It's yours and only yours.

22:11.390 --> 22:14.689
No matter what they say,
or what they think,

22:14.730 --> 22:16.698
or where you are.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.636
( sniffles )

22:35.050 --> 22:35.914
( phone beeps )

22:35.950 --> 22:37.212
Remy over phone:
Hey, Charley.

22:37.250 --> 22:40.117
I feel really bad about
what happened with Micah.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.857
But I'd be lying
if I said

22:42.890 --> 22:46.053
I didn't want_
to see you again.

22:46.090 --> 22:50.595
I'd like to talk
about this, okay?

22:50.630 --> 22:51.927
Call me.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.460
( phone beeps )

22:53.500 --> 22:55.934
( footsteps approach )

22:55.970 --> 22:58.006
Wow!

22:58.040 --> 22:59.769
( laughs )

22:59.810 --> 23:02.677
Ooh, you look amazing.

23:02.710 --> 23:06.874
Ooh, champagne brunch
with the dean.

23:06.910 --> 23:10.141
I'm told the guest list
includes the governor's wife,

23:10.180 --> 23:11.738
a congressman.

23:11.790 --> 23:15.180
Owner of the New Orleans
Stingers? What's his name?

23:15.220 --> 23:16.983
Frank Rovnerman?

23:17.020 --> 23:18.681
Fancy, fancy.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.755
I just got to lock up
Micah's admission.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.724
And I need to stop by
the farm first.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.819
Me and Ralph Angel are meeting
with the bank loan rep.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.764
Feels like the minute
I get one thing done,

23:31.810 --> 23:33.630
10 more tasks show up.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.705
Baby, that's life.

23:35.740 --> 23:38.641
At least you're thinking
about yourself

23:38.680 --> 23:40.978
and that fresh start.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.841
Ralph Angel told me
that you filed for divorce.
That's good.

23:43.890 --> 23:49.681
When they don't realize
what they have in us,

23:49.720 --> 23:52.689
when they violate
the love we give,

23:52.730 --> 23:54.823
we got to learn
to cut them loose.

23:59.700 --> 24:04.160
Took me way too long
to learn that with Jimmy Dale.

24:04.210 --> 24:09.739
So, I'm very happy that you're
not making the same mistake.

24:12.610 --> 24:14.077
Thanks, Aunt Vi.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.684
I really needed
to hear that today.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.686
Is Hollywood
in that category?

24:23.730 --> 24:26.153
With Jimmy Dale
and Davis?

24:28.160 --> 24:29.229
No.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.967
No.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.093
You need to talk to him,
Aunt Vi.

24:36.800 --> 24:42.670
Yeah, well, he still out
on the rig now, so...

24:42.710 --> 24:44.871
Morning, Aunt Vi.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.515
- Morning, baby.
- Hi, honey.

24:47.550 --> 24:50.075
I'm going to the mall
with Keke and some
of her friends,

24:50.120 --> 24:52.645
but I will be back tonight
to help you at the High Yellow.

24:52.690 --> 24:54.681
How are you getting
to the mall?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.119
Micah?

24:56.160 --> 24:57.252
( door opens )

24:57.290 --> 24:58.780
Now, what was that all about?

24:58.830 --> 25:01.025
( door closes )

25:02.860 --> 25:05.192
He's giving me
the silent treatment.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.118
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.638
Well, you need to give him
the ass-whupping treatment.

25:09.670 --> 25:10.864
( laughs )

25:10.910 --> 25:13.037
Shoot

25:13.070 --> 25:17.109
Baby, they still have you
listed as Charlotte West.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.917
They dropped the Bordelon.
You need to get that fixed.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.180
Good luck.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.585
You, too.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.780
Okay.

25:27.820 --> 25:30.152
The reopening
is going to be great.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.622
It is.

25:33.660 --> 25:34.922
All right.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.668
Can I crack an egg?

26:28.720 --> 26:29.948
Remember what
I told you?

26:29.980 --> 26:32.881
One crack at the side,
then open it quick.

26:35.390 --> 26:36.812
Just like that.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.828
Good job, buddy.
Good job.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.725
So, after breakfast,
what you want to do?

26:40.760 --> 26:42.694
Is Mom coming over?

26:42.730 --> 26:44.061
I don't think so.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.227
She probably has stuff to do
on a Saturday.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.363
Can you ask?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.628
Blue...

26:51.270 --> 26:53.602
you don't want to hang out
with me no more?

26:54.740 --> 26:56.332
What, I'm not good enough?

26:56.380 --> 26:57.847
You're good, Pop,

26:57.880 --> 26:59.973
but I like it when
it's the three of us.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.017
I think that needs
some vanilla.

27:03.050 --> 27:04.938
- Me, too.
- You're making a mess.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.719
- Go ahead, put it in there.
- ( knock on door)

27:06.750 --> 27:08.183
I'm going to stir it.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.853
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.926
- Auntie Charley!
- Hi, honey! Whoa, whoa.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.996
Blue, ease up.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.918
Aunt Charley
got her Prada on.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.190
Come on, go wash up.
She don't want to get dirty.

27:19.230 --> 27:21.039
- Okay.
- Wipe that off your face.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.129
- Blue: Okay.
- Bye, baby.

27:25.870 --> 27:28.998
Charley, you need
to see this.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.678
Are these the loan advisor's
assessments?

27:30.710 --> 27:34.009
Yeah. He came out yesterday,
said our acreage looks good.

27:34.050 --> 27:37.269
Our soil composition is deep,
well drained,

27:37.320 --> 27:39.049
no infestation, all that.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.387
We going to get
that loan no problem.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.685
Okay. But the loan officer
will be here soon,

27:43.730 --> 27:46.119
so how much did he say we could
get for this harvest?

27:46.160 --> 27:48.048
You ain't going
to believe this.

27:48.100 --> 27:53.220
He said we looking to make
$1.5 million from our 300 acres.

27:53.270 --> 27:55.033
You're kidding?

27:55.070 --> 27:56.958
No. We about to be rich!

27:57.000 --> 28:00.163
If the cane stays dry and we
have a good grind with the mill,

28:00.210 --> 28:01.438
that's what
we're gomg to make.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.847
What did he say if all
800 acres were harvested?

28:04.880 --> 28:06.347
- In a good year?
- Yeah.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.779
( laughs )

28:07.820 --> 28:09.139
Check this.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.385
We could bring in
$4.2 million.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.185
Look, I knew
we would do good,

28:18.230 --> 28:20.289
but I didn't know
it was that kind of money.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.888
Okay, calm down.

28:21.930 --> 28:24.319
Oh, now, come on, Charley.
Can't we celebrate?

28:24.370 --> 28:26.099
We'll celebrate once
the loan comes in

28:26.130 --> 28:27.836
and we figure out
where to grind our cane.

28:27.870 --> 28:29.337
(vehicle approaching )

28:30.500 --> 28:31.967
I'll check that out.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.717
We got to handle this.

28:51.790 --> 28:53.018
Mr. Boudreaux,

28:53.060 --> 28:54.322
what are you
doing here?

28:54.360 --> 28:55.827
Mrs. West.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.225
And you must be Ralph Angel.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.023
- I'm--
- I know who you are.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.095
What business
you got here?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.937
Well, never heard back
from you with an answer

29:02.970 --> 29:04.369
regarding our offer.
Thought I'd pay you a visit.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.207
My siblings and I
talked it over,

29:06.240 --> 29:07.832
and a few things
came to light--

29:07.880 --> 29:09.939
Ralph Angel:
We ain't selling our farm.

29:09.980 --> 29:13.245
So, y'all Landrys
and Boudreauxs,

29:13.280 --> 29:16.738
y'all can quit trying
to buy it out from under us.

29:19.150 --> 29:22.381
Are you certain
of this decision?

29:24.030 --> 29:25.486
Yes, we are.

29:32.430 --> 29:35.194
How you think you're going
to make harvest?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.067
Excuse me?

29:39.110 --> 29:40.975
You need a mill
to grind your cane.

29:41.010 --> 29:43.001
We_own_ all the mills
in this parish.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.871
- Is that a threat?
- No.

29:44.910 --> 29:48.243
A threat would be
hypothetical.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.142
That's just fact.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.784
We got a problem,
partner? Huh?

29:55.060 --> 29:58.029
No need to get riled up.

29:59.260 --> 30:02.297
My family are reasonable
people, Mrs. West.

30:02.330 --> 30:07.996
See, your farm is smack-dab
in the middle of our land.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.359
Has been for years.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.300
I think our offer
was more than generous.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.309
Four million dollars
is a lot of money.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.228
And if you're not willing
to cooperate...

30:18.510 --> 30:19.841
things might get difficult.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.113
As difficult as you made them
for our father?

30:28.160 --> 30:31.323
It's the good ole boys club,
right?

30:31.360 --> 30:35.091
The Landrys have the money
and the power and the influence

30:35.130 --> 30:36.392
in this parish.

30:36.430 --> 30:38.068
Always have.

30:39.630 --> 30:43.339
That time is coming
to an end.

30:43.370 --> 30:48.603
I suggest you get in your car
and get off our land

30:48.640 --> 30:52.246
if you know what's best.

30:53.410 --> 30:55.469
Okay.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.210
Oh, before I forget,

31:03.260 --> 31:05.148
we got a hold
of that application

31:05.190 --> 31:08.193
the crop advisor submitted.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.892
I'm afraid your bank loan
was denied.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.902
( spits )

31:21.540 --> 31:23.405
( muttering )

31:53.170 --> 31:54.569
( indistinct chatter )

32:21.100 --> 32:23.534
Excuse me.

32:23.570 --> 32:24.707
Charley Bordelon-West.

32:24.740 --> 32:25.707
Frank Rovner.

32:25.740 --> 32:27.731
I have not had the pleasure.

32:27.770 --> 32:31.445
We have run in the same
Circles for years.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.448
I had no idea you were
from the South.

32:33.480 --> 32:37.109
Didn't have much use for a
southern accent in Los Angeles.

32:37.150 --> 32:38.583
( both laugh )

32:38.620 --> 32:40.212
Mm-mm.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.684
So, your son's going
to be a Gardini man?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.153
Starting in the fall.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.226
Now, what do you have,
a son or daughter?

32:46.260 --> 32:48.057
Daughter. Fiona.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.419
Fifteen going on 25.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.621
Oh, tell me about it.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.489
Congrats, by the way.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.339
The Stingers win
over the Grizzlies.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.065
That was impressive.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.568
It was a close one.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.736
Charley:
Thank you, Frank.

33:01.610 --> 33:04.670
I saw your husband
was back on the market.

33:04.710 --> 33:07.577
Cuban and I have a bet whether
it's the Knicks or the Nets.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.577
( laughs )

33:08.620 --> 33:11.248
It's not too late for it
to be the Stingers.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.609
Ooh, too rich for my blood.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.982
How do you know
if you don't make an offer?

33:16.560 --> 33:18.653
You're telling me a franchise
player like Davis West

33:18.690 --> 33:21.625
would come down here for
anything less than $15 million?

33:21.660 --> 33:23.753
I think there's room _
to negotiate when two parties

33:23.800 --> 33:25.392
have something to gain.

33:27.530 --> 33:31.432
After that, uh...scandal,

33:31.470 --> 33:34.303
I thought you would have
moved on as his manager.

33:34.340 --> 33:36.399
The two of you
would have parted ways.

33:40.410 --> 33:42.617
Frank, I'll be candid.

33:42.650 --> 33:46.142
I'm the CEO of a business
known as Davis West.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.418
Now, whether my product
is called

33:47.450 --> 33:50.715
"The Gentleman" or "The Gigolo,"
it all works.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.150
Just depends on how
it's packaged.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.779
* Every time
we go out dancing... *

34:12.810 --> 34:14.846
Hey, baby.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.518
( both laugh )

34:16.550 --> 34:18.211
Did you bring me
another set of hands?

34:18.250 --> 34:20.480
Aunt Vi, this is Too Sweet.
Too Sweet, this is my Aunt Vi.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.215
We hug around here, baby.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.409
( laughs )

34:23.460 --> 34:24.654
Nice to meet you,
Too Sweet.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.123
Thanks for having me, ma'am.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.752
"Miss Vi" will do just fine.

34:27.790 --> 34:29.792
Nova:
And that's my brother
Ralph Angel.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.422
Hey.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.665
And Micah and Blue.
My nephews.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.192
Ralph:
What you say?

34:37.740 --> 34:39.230
Hey, little man.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.760
Hi.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.835
- Micah.
- Too Sweet.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.438
Yeah.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.803
Miss Vi, can I go
to the bathroom?

34:47.850 --> 34:50.114
Oh, it's right there
to the left, baby.

34:53.220 --> 34:58.180
Blue, come. I'm going to show
you the new soda machine.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.499
Get your mama.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.232
Come on, Mom.
Let's go.

35:13.710 --> 35:17.498
Please don't get him
hopped up on that sugar now.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.269
Violet:
Mind your business!

35:19.310 --> 35:21.471
- ( laughing )
- You got my message?

35:21.520 --> 35:24.216
Yeah. I can't believe
Jacob Boudreaux had the nerve
to come out there like that.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.639
He's luclq I wasn't there.
I'll put a rut on that
whole family.

35:26.690 --> 35:28.783
Look, if Blue wasn't around,
it was about to go down--

35:28.820 --> 35:30.617
Have you talked to Charley?
How are we going to grind
without a mill?

35:30.660 --> 35:33.481
I don't know
and she don't know.

35:33.530 --> 35:35.691
But we got
to do something.

35:35.730 --> 35:38.528
We ain't going out
like this.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.663
I'm going to finish
hanging these lights.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.333
Can I talk to you?

35:47.370 --> 35:48.507
Is this about my mom?

35:48.540 --> 35:50.599
"Is this about my mom?"

35:50.640 --> 35:54.815
Listen, I'm not going to try
to lecture you, Micah, okay?

35:54.850 --> 35:57.216
But everything's
not black and white.

35:57.250 --> 35:58.945
Life is gray as hell.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.617
And with everything
you've been through,

36:00.650 --> 36:03.551
you know I'm telling
the truth.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.285
As you get older, you start
to see your mama and daddy

36:05.330 --> 36:07.651
as real people.

36:07.690 --> 36:09.328
And people
mess up sometimes.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.669
Well, them more
than most, but--

36:11.700 --> 36:14.237
Not true. No more than me.
No more than you.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.631
Look, your mama's been put
through the ringer.

36:18.670 --> 36:20.934
Put yourself
in her place.

36:20.970 --> 36:24.349
The betrayal.
The humiliation.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.268
Taking every arrow,

36:26.310 --> 36:28.778
while trying to stop
every arrow from hitting you.

36:30.580 --> 36:33.686
Everybody don't have
a mama like that.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.263
- What's up, man?
- What's up? What's up?

36:44.300 --> 36:45.961
I'm cool, man.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.365
You ball?

36:47.400 --> 36:49.436
Oh, no.
Not really my thing.

36:49.470 --> 36:50.960
- Aw.
- You?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.934
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I ball.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.506
All the time.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.235
So, I just want
to thank y'all

36:56.280 --> 36:59.704
for all the hard work
over the last couple of days.

36:59.750 --> 37:04.585
Clive, thank you for doing right
and making me manager.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.485
( all chuckle )

37:06.520 --> 37:08.385
Let's get on with it.

37:08.420 --> 37:09.887
( chatter and applause )

37:11.930 --> 37:13.750
All right, y'all.
Come on in here.

37:13.790 --> 37:15.553
( laughs )

37:15.600 --> 37:17.727
Good to see you.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.921
- Hey, Cathy.
- Woman: Hey, Vi.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.494
Man:_
Hey, Vi.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.996
Violet:
Y'all looking good.
Look at you.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.338
( indistinct chatter )

37:25.370 --> 37:26.564
Come on,
everybody.

37:26.610 --> 37:28.032
Let's get out
to this dance floor

37:28.070 --> 37:29.469
and shake it loose.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.307
( upbeat music plays )

37:31.350 --> 37:32.772
( indistinct chatter )

37:48.700 --> 37:49.951
Good to see y'all.

38:00.740 --> 38:02.799
Hi.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.273
Hi.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.944
May I have
this dance?

38:13.850 --> 38:14.987
Go.

38:22.830 --> 38:25.367
( upbeat dance music plays )

39:05.970 --> 39:08.803
I put Blue to bed
on the sofa in the office.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.638
That boy will sleep
through anything, I'll tell you.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.613
Man:
Time to slow this party down

39:16.650 --> 39:18.845
for the lovers out there.

39:24.460 --> 39:28.396
* When I sing it

39:28.430 --> 39:30.853
* I know it

39:30.900 --> 39:33.425
* When I sense it

39:33.470 --> 39:35.597
* I control it

39:35.640 --> 39:38.404
Dance with me?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.509
Come on.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.908
Come on.

39:45.810 --> 39:50.179
* Right now he
feels he loves me *

39:50.220 --> 39:55.556
* Give it time,
he'll end up leaving *

39:55.590 --> 39:57.956
* Just to miss me

39:57.990 --> 40:03.053
* Just to swear
he never left, really *

40:05.800 --> 40:10.669
* Today was so insane

40:10.700 --> 40:15.637
* Next week
we won't agree *

40:15.680 --> 40:19.639
* Next month
we'll barely speak *

40:19.680 --> 40:25.016
* To fix what's wrong *

40:25.050 --> 40:32.752
* So no,
I know he can't love me *

40:36.160 --> 40:38.196
( music continues )

40:52.680 --> 40:54.978
( music plays )
