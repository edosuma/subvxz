00:14.615 --> 00:15.681
Man: Fu...

00:15.683 --> 00:17.383
There's something on the roof.

00:17.385 --> 00:21.520
Something big.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.726
Oh, shit!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.695
What the fuck was that?

00:50.617 --> 00:52.651
Anybody out there?

00:52.653 --> 00:55.721
Look, I don't play that
Michael Myers shit!

00:55.723 --> 01:00.793
I got a .45 and a crucifix!

01:00.795 --> 01:03.095
I go to friendship
baptist church!

01:08.334 --> 01:11.170
Look, man, I'm coming right now!

01:24.717 --> 01:26.218
Hey, I see you!

01:32.393 --> 01:34.726
Devon!

01:34.728 --> 01:36.328
Devon: Jamal?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.396
Jamal: Devon!

01:39.532 --> 01:40.766
Shit.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.369
Jesus, Jamal.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.472
You okay?

01:46.474 --> 01:49.308
You were supposed to hit
the stunt pad, bro.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.777
Jamal: I totally missed it.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.147
I'd have cracked my
damned ass, shit.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.149
I think your ass

01:57.151 --> 01:58.617
is already cracked.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.687
Jamal: You gonna
help me up or what?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.155
Yeah, come here.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.428
How'd you miss that?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.795
Jamal: It's totally
pitch black out here!

02:10.798 --> 02:11.864
It's huge!

02:13.333 --> 02:15.300
Did you at least get the shot?

02:15.302 --> 02:16.368
Jamal: I almost
killed myself,

02:16.370 --> 02:17.803
but yeah, I got the shot.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.471
Of course you did.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.274
Let's go post it online,

02:22.276 --> 02:23.842
scare the shit out of people.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.579
Devon: This is
boring, boring, boring,

02:27.581 --> 02:28.647
oh, look at that.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.715
Bye, Jamal!

02:29.717 --> 02:31.550
See ya!

02:31.552 --> 02:34.286
Jamal: Man, you do not pay
me enough for this.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.622
Yo, Dev, man, check
out the hit count.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.856
Devon: I know!

02:37.858 --> 02:39.356
Hey, the channel's blowing up.

02:39.358 --> 02:41.693
The more videos we post, the more
hits we get across the line.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.829
Even that grainy shit we filmed
back in the day.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.464
Jamal: Hell, yeah!

02:45.466 --> 02:47.733
All those views, that's all
money right there, baby!

02:47.735 --> 02:50.402
But you know...

02:50.404 --> 02:51.537
Jamal: What?

02:51.539 --> 02:53.205
We can make more.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.806
Jamal: Like make more money?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.542
You already know I'm with that.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.678
What if we turn
this into a show?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.414
We go out looking
for real monsters.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.549
Jamal: Okay, Devon.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.417
You do know monsters ain't real.

03:05.419 --> 03:08.387
It doesn't matter if
they're real or fake.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.657
People will watch.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.625
And they'll want to
believe it's real.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.394
Jamal: Yo, Dev!

03:15.895 --> 03:17.294
Yeah, what's up?

03:17.296 --> 03:19.731
Jamal: Bro, grab your camera,
come check this out.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.931
Check what out?

03:20.933 --> 03:23.368
Jamal: Dude, just trust me!
Come check it out.

03:26.941 --> 03:30.475
I'm telling you, bro, man,
you're gonna like this name.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.711
Devon: What am I looking at?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.479
Jamal: The monster project.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.581
Bang bang.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.383
Devon: Original.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.219
Hey, I couldn't figure
nothing else, man.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.788
Blair witch was already taken.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.528
Jamal: What is that,
like the casting call?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.963
Devon: Sure is,
I just finished it.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.397
Check it out.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.600
Attention all monsters
in the Los Angeles area,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.401
looking for subjects
to be interviewed

03:56.403 --> 03:57.769
for a documentary titled...

03:57.771 --> 03:59.371
Jamal:
The monster project,

03:59.373 --> 04:00.839
rawr.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.442
Okay.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.843
Actors do not submit.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.478
Serious inquiries only.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.380
If you suffer from
legitimate conditions

04:08.382 --> 04:10.816
like clinical lycanthropy
and renfield's syndrome

04:10.818 --> 04:12.718
or believe that
you are inflicted

04:12.720 --> 04:14.920
by the supernatural
or paranormal,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.654
call the number below.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.423
No age or ethnicity
requirements.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.591
Jamal: Can we add, like,

04:20.594 --> 04:22.327
no ugly hos allowed?

04:26.567 --> 04:27.899
Hey, mom, dad.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.703
Um, this is video log 237,

04:31.705 --> 04:34.539
so you know what that means.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.942
Two hundred thirty
single days sober.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.544
It'll be 240 on my birthday.

04:41.681 --> 04:45.884
Got the money transfer
you sent, thanks again.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.552
I'm still waiting
on some new jobs

04:47.554 --> 04:48.787
I applied for.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.625
Trying to put the
pieces back together.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.830
Been going to aa
meetings at the church.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.400
Actually, the pastor
tonight told us

05:01.402 --> 05:03.969
about this old story.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.773
Inside all of us there's
this battle between duals.

05:09.575 --> 05:16.481
One is good, love,
you know, bravery.

05:18.718 --> 05:25.390
And the other is evil,
you know, fear, guilt,

05:25.392 --> 05:30.462
jealousy, and addiction.

05:33.066 --> 05:37.502
When I asked him,
which one wins, he said,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.905
the one that you feed,

05:39.907 --> 05:42.908
which made me
think about myself.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.746
And I still feel...

05:47.748 --> 05:49.081
Hey, Bry.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.181
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
No, I just...

05:50.183 --> 05:51.850
Murielle: Recording
one of your video diaries.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.418
No, I was just wrapping up.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.619
Come and say hi.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.123
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jay.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.126
Don't worry, me
and Jamal, we got

06:01.128 --> 06:02.761
your boy's birthday
covered this year.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.931
We'll film the whole party
and send you the highlights.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.032
I need you to move your car.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.567
I'm off to set Colton's and 30.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.635
What, are they finally
going to let you direct?

06:10.637 --> 06:13.905
Now we'll see when that happens.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.141
Will you cast me
when you're famous?

06:16.143 --> 06:19.711
Yes.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.447
I'll let you finish up.
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Jay!

06:25.985 --> 06:28.120
All right.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.956
I guess it's rude to keep
a beautiful girl waiting

06:30.958 --> 06:36.795
so, uh, one day at a time.

06:37.797 --> 06:43.835
I'll see you tomorrow
at 200 and 38.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.103
Bye.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.007
It's day one on our
search for monsters.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.009
Right now we are
heading east of la

06:51.011 --> 06:52.744
to an Indian
reservation to meet up

06:52.746 --> 06:55.547
with a guy who claims
to be a skinwalker.

06:55.549 --> 06:59.484
Jamal: So we're meeting
a native American werewolf?

06:59.486 --> 07:00.552
Basically.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.156
Jamal: Devon,
look at this shit.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.792
It says "no trespassing."

07:06.794 --> 07:09.461
Do you really think
we should be here?

07:09.463 --> 07:12.531
Yo, I'm running out of breath.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.066
We've walked like ten feet.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.002
How are you out of breath?

07:17.004 --> 07:19.671
Jamal: You know, I'm a
little skeptical about this.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.173
Devon: Relax, he's a cop.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.441
Jamal: A cop?

07:22.443 --> 07:23.775
Hello, I'm black?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.878
Wait, wait, did you hear that?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.548
Jamal: What, you think
it's coyotes or something?

07:31.083 --> 07:33.084
That is the sound of
me fucking with you.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.653
Jamal:

07:34.655 --> 07:36.688
I fucking hate you.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.824
I wish something will
bite you in the ass.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.225
Hey, Dev.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.495
The light's blinkin'.
I'm running out of battery, bro.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.464
You don't have any spares?

07:45.466 --> 07:48.867
Jamal: Nah, man, I
left them in the car.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.873
Devon: Did you hear that?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.241
Jamal: Hell yeah, man,

07:56.243 --> 07:58.910
it sounded like
wolves or something.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.546
Devon: No, they're coyotes.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.052
Steven: Devon?

08:11.724 --> 08:13.124
Jamal: Please don't be mad,

08:13.126 --> 08:15.026
please don't be mad.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.928
He's not mad.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.164
Oh, and he's mad.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.899
Aw, damn.

08:20.901 --> 08:21.967
Here it comes.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.970
Did you get any of
that conversation?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.771
Jamal: I saw he
was wearing like one

08:26.773 --> 08:28.840
of those police
body cameras, maybe.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.910
Do not fuck up
on me again, Jamal.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.147
Jamal: Listen, man, I promise it
won't happen again, all right?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.849
Fuck.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.852
Jamal: Hey, look
on the bright side.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.688
I mean, you did
get your skinwalker

08:43.690 --> 08:46.591
and, I gotta admit,
he does look legit.

08:46.593 --> 08:50.128
Oh, he's legit.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.734
Devon: Hey, you know why the
camera battery is always dead?

08:55.736 --> 08:56.634
Jamal: Why?

08:56.636 --> 08:58.637
Devon: Because you keep
filming stupid shit like this,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.205
you're supposed
to be giving me directions.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.740
Jamal: What do you
need directions for?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.208
You know which house it is.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.011
Back up, back up.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.078
Why?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.847
Jamal: Just back the fuck up.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.215
What the hell is the problem?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.816
Jamal: Murielle's still here.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.685
She was supposed to be
out by 9:00.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.154
Aw, shit, turn the lights off.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.728
Devon: This is so stupid.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.164
How old are we?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.766
We've work to do!

09:27.768 --> 09:29.134
Jamal: Listen, I
told your ass when

09:29.136 --> 09:31.236
you started dating Murielle
that if you messed up,

09:31.238 --> 09:32.971
there was gonna be consequences.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.973
I thought that meant you were
going to kick my ass?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.576
Jamal: Yeah, well,
I still need to!

09:37.578 --> 09:39.945
Look, you and me, we're cool,

09:39.947 --> 09:42.981
but you and Murielle,
that's a whole other story.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.349
She holds grudges.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.252
She still hasn't
forgave you for leaving.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.154
I came back to Cali.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.189
Jamal: Yeah, well, you
didn't come back to her.

09:51.191 --> 09:55.060
Oh, shit, there she go,
duck, duck, get low.

09:57.129 --> 10:00.098
Well, welcome back
to my crib, Dev!

10:04.170 --> 10:05.604
That's new.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.706
Jamal: Oh yeah,
that's Bryan's.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.075
What's up, Bry?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.209
What you cooking?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.812
It's, uh, dinner.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.914
Jamal: You mean my dinner
because you for damn sure

10:15.916 --> 10:17.949
don't buy no
groceries over here.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.085
I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

10:20.087 --> 10:24.656
Hey, you, uh, you got a package.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.826
Jamal: I didn't
order anything.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.227
Devon: I did.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.231
I'm, uh, Bryan.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.634
Sorry, we haven't met.

10:35.636 --> 10:36.701
I'm Devon.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.239
What, Devon?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.141
What, the Devon?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.977
Jamal:
Bry, be cool, chill out.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.213
Yeah, sorry, just heard
that you moved away.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.653
Yeah, I got back
about a month ago.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.822
Jamal: Hey!

10:57.824 --> 10:58.890
Really?

10:58.892 --> 11:01.259
Jamal: Uh, hi, Murielle.
Really?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.327
Murielle...

11:02.329 --> 11:04.929
Stay the fuck out of my life.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.834
Jamal: Maybe we should
work on this another time.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.271
No.
We have work to do.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.141
Don't you think you should
work somewhere else, I mean?

11:17.910 --> 11:20.078
What are you, her boyfriend?

11:20.080 --> 11:23.314
Jamal: Look, man, we're just going
to work out in my room, all right?

11:23.316 --> 11:27.052
You know, this, gotta have
respect for this house he's in.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.221
Jamal: Yeah, my
house, and my fishsticks.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.756
Ooh, and good, too!

11:31.758 --> 11:33.458
We got another response
to the casting notice.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.726
Jamal: Ooh!

11:34.728 --> 11:36.461
And she's a vampire.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.930
Oh, shit, what,
like a sexy Dracula?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.032
She didn't attach
a photo to her email,

11:41.034 --> 11:43.835
but her bio was
convincing enough.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.770
Her name is Shayla.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.439
She's a tattoo artist so she works
at night and sleeps during the day.

11:47.441 --> 11:50.041
And get this, she drinks blood.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.143
Jamal: The fuck,
what kind of blood?

11:52.145 --> 11:53.778
Oh, this kind.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.180
Jamal: Oh, shit!

11:55.182 --> 11:57.248
Yo, you are trippin'.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.284
You order needles
off the Internet?

11:59.286 --> 12:01.786
She says we can do the interview
in exchange for a vial of blood.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.089
So I'm gonna need your arm.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.924
Jamal: Oh, hell no!

12:06.726 --> 12:07.725
A hundred bucks.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.360
Jamal: Do I look
like a crackhead to you?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.796
I ain't that damn broke.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.865
Well, you know anybody
who is that damn broke?

12:15.801 --> 12:18.436
You know, I can't
believe I'm doing this.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.305
Jamal: How else are
you gonna pay rent?

12:20.307 --> 12:23.508
Listen, you left Detroit and came
to la to be an actor, right?

12:23.510 --> 12:27.112
Well, just look at this as
your first on-camera gig.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.947
Bryan:
Just the role I always wanted.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.315
A guy with a needle in his arm.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.915
Jamal: Believe me, bro.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.953
It already pays better than
most Hollywood acting gigs.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.259
Devon: Tasty, tasty.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.762
Now let's go catch a vampire.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.473
Jamal: Where's the drop
off supposed to go down?

12:55.475 --> 12:59.544
She said to leave it on a
park bench near a swing set.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.514
Well, there's kind of a lot of
park benches there.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.082
Devon: Yeah, I see that.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.818
Jamal: Worst blind date ever.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.554
Man, just put it down.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.822
Okay.

13:15.630 --> 13:16.529
Jamal: Bryan!

13:16.530 --> 13:19.497
Devon: Would you tell
Tony hawk to shut up?

13:22.368 --> 13:24.102
Jamal: Shit, did you see that?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.408
Jamal:
Oh, shit, oh.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.243
Devon: It's gone.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.580
Jamal: Oh, hell, no.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.850
Devon: The blood
vial, it's gone.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.087
Did you get it on camera?

13:43.089 --> 13:46.090
Why do you guys want to go
looking for this again?

13:46.092 --> 13:47.392
Monsters?

13:47.394 --> 13:49.294
Jamal: Because we're
getting paid, that's why.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.564
What, demons, vampires?

13:52.566 --> 13:55.433
Look, I don't think we should be
going looking for those things.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.435
Devon: For fuck's sakes,
Bryan, none of it's real.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.404
Jamal: Exactly.
Pull your fucking skirt up.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.973
The Bible says that
demons are real,

14:01.975 --> 14:06.077
so if they're real then who's to say
what else is out there in the dark?

14:06.079 --> 14:10.315
I mean, evil seeps through
the cracks of society

14:10.317 --> 14:13.284
and it targets
vulnerable people.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.453
So who's to say that
the devil hasn't

14:15.455 --> 14:18.423
transcended in different ways?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.997
Jamal:
What the f...

14:27.933 --> 14:30.635
Oh, my gosh, what
is up, this door?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.938
Who is it?

14:33.940 --> 14:35.340
Bryan: It's 3:00 A.M.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.540
Jamal: Who is it?

14:36.542 --> 14:40.011
Yo, that better not be one of
your drunk ass friends.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.016
Yo, why are you
banging on the door?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.320
What the f...

14:58.631 --> 15:01.299
What, what is that?

15:01.301 --> 15:02.367
"Shiori"?

15:03.569 --> 15:06.404
Dude, what took you so long?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.106
Is it safe for me to be here?

15:08.108 --> 15:10.008
Jamal: Yeah, Murielle's
still out on a shoot.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.477
Sit down, you gotta
see this shit!

15:12.479 --> 15:15.246
The DVD's in, just press play!

15:20.219 --> 15:23.187
<i>Hello.</i>

15:23.189 --> 15:24.555
<i>My name is Shiori.</i>

15:25.691 --> 15:26.958
<i>I need help.</i>

15:29.495 --> 15:32.163
<i>I must have caught something.</i>

15:34.199 --> 15:36.200
<i>Something is inside me.</i>

15:39.705 --> 15:41.606
<i>Tells me to do things.</i>

15:43.542 --> 15:44.609
<i>Bad things.</i>

15:48.113 --> 15:50.515
<i>My parents don't understand.</i>

15:53.385 --> 15:55.987
<i>They're scared of what I am.</i>

16:00.025 --> 16:01.326
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:09.968
Jamal: Oh, shit!

16:09.970 --> 16:12.603
Hell no, hell no!

16:12.605 --> 16:14.539
Did you see that shit?

16:14.541 --> 16:17.475
Devon, I know you've
seen that shit!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.710
What the fuck?

16:20.446 --> 16:21.713
Whoa.

16:21.715 --> 16:22.913
Hi, is this Shiori?

16:22.915 --> 16:24.413
Jamal: Ask that little bitch
how she found my house!

16:24.415 --> 16:27.585
Would you keep your voice down? I put
your address in the Craigslist ad.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.653
Jamal: You did what?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.154
Shut up!

16:30.156 --> 16:32.557
Hi, this is Devon
Adams, the producer

16:32.559 --> 16:34.092
of the monster project.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.094
I'm sorry to call so
late, I just finished

16:36.096 --> 16:37.495
watching your DVD

16:37.497 --> 16:40.031
and if you're still
interested in...

16:43.402 --> 16:44.502
That's correct.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.173
Perfect.

16:48.174 --> 16:52.410
Jamal: You remember what
Bryan said in the car earlier?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.079
Some things you just
shouldn't go looking for?

16:55.081 --> 16:56.414
That girl's one of them.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.282
Oh, spare me,
you're going to take life advice

16:58.284 --> 17:00.718
from the deadbeat bumming off
your blow-up mattress?

17:01.788 --> 17:03.354
Kid's a parasite.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.556
Jamal: Look, you don't know
what he's been through.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.692
Bryan's seen some
real evil in his life.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.660
Yeah, I saw the track
mark scars on his arm

17:09.662 --> 17:11.529
when I drew his blood.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.730
Kid's a junkie, too.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.198
Jamal: Was.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.567
He just got out of rehab
a couple of months back.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.435
Once a junkie, always a junkie.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.505
Didn't you see
<i>requiem for a dream?</i>

17:20.507 --> 17:21.571
They don't beat it.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.708
Jamal: Shit!

17:23.710 --> 17:26.077
I hope he didn't hear us.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.749
Happy birthday!

17:31.751 --> 17:33.151
We love you!

17:33.153 --> 17:36.120
We hope you love your present!

17:40.727 --> 17:43.127
Jamal: Here's the cake!

17:43.129 --> 17:44.595
When I say "happy",

17:44.597 --> 17:46.297
ya'll say "birthday"!

17:46.698 --> 17:47.765
Happy!

17:52.471 --> 17:54.405
That's my guy, yeah!

17:56.642 --> 17:58.476
Hey, hey, watch your lips, boy.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.112
Hey, that was my wish.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.347
Murielle: Don't drink that,
there's dirt all over that.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.850
I've done worse things.
He's done worse.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.618
Jamal: Show me
your big movies, girl!

18:07.620 --> 18:11.656
Jamal: Yeah, you'll be on
<i>soul train</i> any minute now.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.258
Are you serious?

18:14.260 --> 18:17.495
Jamal: Hmm, what's
going on over here?

18:17.497 --> 18:20.565
Looks like some
bullshit going down.

18:21.867 --> 18:25.303
Hey, I think I might have
a little talk with Bryan.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.638
Say what up to your folks, bro!

18:27.640 --> 18:29.640
Do we have to do this now, man?
I was just...

18:29.642 --> 18:32.677
Jamal: Yes, we do. As long as you don't
forget, you know the rules, man.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.445
How many days are we at now?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.348
You know how many days,
I live with you.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.549
Two hundred and forty.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.717
Jamal: Two forty.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.853
I'll definitely drink to that.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.422
Couldn't be more proud.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.524
Oh, my god, I almost forgot your present.
I'll be right back.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.526
Present?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.628
Bet you got nothing to do
with that either, huh?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.498
Jamal: I asked them to deal
with the present, too, man.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.599
It was all my idea.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.501
So she gets me a
cake and a present

18:56.503 --> 18:58.703
and what do you get?

18:58.705 --> 19:00.905
Jamal: I ain't givin' you shit.
You owe me rent.

19:02.407 --> 19:06.611
Anyways, 240 days and
you ain't blown yet?

19:07.579 --> 19:09.380
I don't know about that, bro.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.215
What, you think I'm lying?

19:11.217 --> 19:12.750
Nah, I'm just curious,

19:12.752 --> 19:15.920
'cause I've seen your homeboy
slip something in your pocket.

19:18.790 --> 19:19.857
Yeah.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.496
See, everyone should have one
on their birthday.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.298
Extra large, shouldn't be much.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.501
I've seen yours, those
purple small ones, so...

19:30.503 --> 19:33.604
Jamal: Ha! You got joked, ah!

19:33.606 --> 19:37.775
My bad, bro.
I didn't know, I'm sorry, dude.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.812
You know, I heard you and Devon
talking about me behind my back.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.880
What, that...

19:44.283 --> 19:45.917
Parasite?

19:45.919 --> 19:48.352
Jamal: Listen, you know I
did not say that shit.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.721
No, but you didn't
defend me either.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.824
You know, you're
different around him.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.826
You know he's only
using you, right?

19:55.828 --> 19:57.562
Jamal: No, what he's doing
is paying me.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.764
Yeah, to get to Murielle.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.833
Jamal:
Whatever, man.

20:02.835 --> 20:06.304
Hey, why did you invite him
to my birthday?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.705
Jamal: Invite him?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.674
What are you talking about?

20:09.676 --> 20:11.275
Right fucking behind you.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.443
Jamal: What?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.844
Shit!

20:13.846 --> 20:16.747
Oh, Devon, what
are you doing here?

20:16.749 --> 20:17.815
Relax.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.884
I don't plan on staying.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.220
I just came to apologize.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.389
What's this?

20:26.658 --> 20:27.792
My apology.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.330
Oh, a birthday card?

20:36.368 --> 20:37.702
Is this 600 dollars?

20:37.704 --> 20:39.303
For one day of work.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.005
Jamal: What? That's way
more than what you pay me!

20:41.007 --> 20:42.740
Well, it's not
your birthday, is it?

20:42.742 --> 20:45.943
Jamal: Well, it's not
your birthday, is it?

20:45.945 --> 20:49.313
Look, I'm man enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.650
What I said the other
night was uncalled for.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.951
And if you're interested,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.487
we can use a pa
for the shoot on Sunday,

20:56.489 --> 20:58.856
someone to hold the boom pole.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.493
Murielle: Happy birthday!

21:03.729 --> 21:06.464
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:06.466 --> 21:09.000
Out front now.
You're next.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.402
Jamal: I didn't
even invite him!

21:12.971 --> 21:14.872
Think you can just
waltz in and out

21:14.874 --> 21:16.841
of my life whenever
you fucking please?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.809
That is not how this works.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.579
And tonight of all nights
is not about you.

21:22.714 --> 21:25.483
Then why are you back here
talking to me?

21:25.485 --> 21:26.784
Go back to your
boyfriend's party.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.953
Bryan is my friend,

21:28.955 --> 21:31.289
something you never were.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.490
We were more than friends.

21:34.492 --> 21:37.061
Until you threw me away
like a piece of trash.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.796
But I guess the other
bitch wasn't worth it.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.564
Why else would you
come crawling back?

21:40.566 --> 21:43.701
Hey, I never cheated on you.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.736
I just needed to get
the hell out of la,

21:45.738 --> 21:49.473
to focus, to come
up with a plan.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.075
Too bad I wasn't a part of it.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.077
I want you to be now.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.747
Time apart taught me that.

21:56.749 --> 22:00.518
This project Jamal
and I started,

22:01.320 --> 22:02.753
it has potential.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.791
I want you there with me.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.759
You are fucking insane,

22:08.761 --> 22:12.797
if you think I would ever
grip on my ex-boyfriend's shoot.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.665
I'm not asking you to grip.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.733
What then?

22:17.869 --> 22:20.004
I'm asking you to direct.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.783
Murielle: Did everybody go?

22:32.785 --> 22:35.619
I think Jamal is in his room
hiding from you.

22:36.755 --> 22:40.658
And I'm pretty sure

22:40.660 --> 22:45.062
that everybody else is gone.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.369
Murielle: Your pupils
are super-dilated.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.705
I guess that means
you had a good time.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.112
I still haven't got
my present, as you know.

23:01.114 --> 23:05.649
Oh fuck, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have...

23:05.651 --> 23:07.685
Jamal and I got you
a head-strap camera

23:07.687 --> 23:08.819
so you can film yourself

23:08.821 --> 23:10.421
falling off your skateboard.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.922
I never fall off my skateboard.

23:11.924 --> 23:12.990
Murielle: You only.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.659
I do it like a swan.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.659
Murielle: Yeah.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.797
So, what, has this been
recording the whole time?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.098
Confess your sins.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.568
I turned it on to
film your reaction

23:24.570 --> 23:25.936
when I brought it out.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.606
Didn't expect Devon to be here.

23:32.944 --> 23:35.479
There, super dork.

23:36.681 --> 23:37.982
Bryan: I look awesome.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.784
You haven't seen yourself.

23:39.786 --> 23:43.754
Bryan: So, uh, did anything,

23:44.689 --> 23:47.191
you know,
happen between you two?

23:47.193 --> 23:48.459
I saw your guys...

23:48.461 --> 23:50.828
Yeah, it's broadly on tape.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.766
Suffice it to say,
he offered me a job.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.501
Bryan: Me, too.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.539
So you gonna take it?

24:05.477 --> 24:07.445
It's like I see
exactly what he's doing,

24:07.447 --> 24:10.214
but I still can't say no.

24:10.216 --> 24:13.951
Bryan: Well, I
guess he's all right.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.686
Gave me 600 dollars.

24:16.555 --> 24:17.621
Really?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.089
Bryan: Still an ass.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.791
Yep.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.660
Definitely still an ass.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.930
Bryan: I mean, you guys

24:26.998 --> 24:28.199
getting back together?

24:28.201 --> 24:30.768
No, no, no, no,
no, we're not getting

24:30.770 --> 24:32.937
back together.
Bryan: I was just...

24:32.939 --> 24:36.240
I don't even, I was just saying.
It's hard, though.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.910
There's a lot of history there.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.984
Bryan: You know, we've got
a lot of history, too.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.021
Yeah.

24:52.891 --> 24:53.958
Yeah, we do.

24:59.265 --> 25:03.934
I'm sorry, uh, I shouldn't have.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.271
Fuck, I am going
to go to bed, um.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.908
Are you gonna come inside?

25:10.910 --> 25:13.644
Bryan: Whatever you want.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.115
Good night, Bryan.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.617
Happy birthday.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.271
Bryan: Fuck needing that.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.013
You're a fucking coward, man.

25:51.116 --> 25:53.784
Radio announcer: <i>So something
happening this evening,</i>

25:53.786 --> 25:55.719
<i>pretty exciting for
astronomy enthusiasts,</i>

25:55.721 --> 25:58.622
<i>something called
a total lunar eclipse.</i>

25:58.624 --> 26:01.025
<i>You may not have been aware
that this was even happening.</i>

26:01.027 --> 26:02.893
<i>Tell us all about...</i>
Jamal: Yo, d.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.128
I brought my telephoto lens

26:04.130 --> 26:06.230
so we can check the
eclipse up close.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.999
Don't tell me,
tell the director.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.801
Jamal: Are we still
playing this game?

26:10.803 --> 26:13.103
Devon, this is
still your project.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.105
And I will still be the
one in front of the camera

26:15.107 --> 26:17.007
and Murielle will just
handle everything behind it.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.309
Murielle: That's right.
Jamal: What?

26:18.311 --> 26:20.144
I thought that was my job.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.912
Your job is to keep
the fucking batteries

26:21.914 --> 26:24.014
charged this time.

26:24.016 --> 26:27.051
Not fair. Really?
Big job for a big man.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.020
And what are you
laughing at, Mr. pa?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.989
You still on the
bottom of the chain.

26:31.991 --> 26:35.659
Yeah, except I'm still making
more money than you are.

26:35.661 --> 26:37.795
Jamal: Yo, Devon,
I can't work like this!

26:37.797 --> 26:39.830
I need a raise.

26:39.832 --> 26:44.134
I'm sorry, man. I used the rest of
the budget on renting the location.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.804
Jamal: My allergies are
not going to like this.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.006
Devon: There it is.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.274
That's the house.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.642
Murielle: Charming.
Who's the guy?

26:51.644 --> 26:52.710
Devon: That must be Richard.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.111
Jamal: What?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.411
He's the property owner.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.147
We only spoke over
the phone a few times.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.649
Bryan: So just
to get this right,

26:58.651 --> 27:00.117
we're here to interview
three monsters

27:00.119 --> 27:01.785
in a creepy house in the woods

27:01.787 --> 27:03.153
on the night of an eclipse.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.122
Jamal: They're not
real monsters, Bryan.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.324
Bryan: Looks like you got
tonight all figured out, Devon.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.394
Devon: Trust me. It all adds to
the value of the production.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.229
Tonight will be perfect.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.297
Murielle: That's weird.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.297
Devon: What?

27:14.299 --> 27:16.834
Murielle: The windows
are all boarded up.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.772
Murielle: Here we go.

27:21.774 --> 27:24.908
Do you mind looking like a dork
for the rest of the day?

27:24.910 --> 27:27.344
The extra footage could
come in handy in the edit.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.380
Bryan: Whatever
the director says.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.081
Thank you.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.684
Are you guys, you filming?

27:33.686 --> 27:35.853
Jamal: Yeah,
you got a problem?

27:35.855 --> 27:40.257
Nah, nah, I don't like cameras.

27:40.259 --> 27:44.161
Bryan: So, are we gonna
talk at all or just, uh...

27:44.163 --> 27:46.664
Now is really not
the time, Bryan.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.132
Besides, there's
nothing to talk about.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.967
What do you mean, there's
nothing to talk about?

27:49.969 --> 27:51.667
You kissed me.

27:51.669 --> 27:55.439
Yeah, I was drunk and I was
upset and you were nice to me.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.741
It was a mistake.
Bryan: It was a mistake?

27:57.743 --> 28:01.245
You were drunk and I
was just there, really?

28:01.247 --> 28:02.780
Please don't do this.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.048
Look, you're one
of my best friends.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.284
Don't ruin what we
already have, okay?

28:12.123 --> 28:13.323
Bryan: I'll just
get the big one.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.391
Murielle: Thanks.

28:19.097 --> 28:20.431
Jamal: As much as
you don't like cameras

28:20.433 --> 28:23.300
you sure got a lot of
cameras rigged up here.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.970
Richard: Well, the place
is broken into a lot.

28:26.972 --> 28:30.107
A lot of people
sneak in, have sex,

28:30.109 --> 28:32.710
shoot up, sacrifice animals.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.878
The security in this
place costs more

28:34.880 --> 28:36.346
than the damn house is worth.

28:36.348 --> 28:39.083
Murielle: I'm sorry did you
just say sacrifice animals?

28:40.185 --> 28:43.954
Yeah, in the '60s
this was part of a

28:43.956 --> 28:47.291
headquarters for
a satanic group.

28:48.426 --> 28:51.061
Is this guy fucking serious?

28:51.063 --> 28:53.130
Devon: Hey, uh,
guys, before we head in,

28:53.132 --> 28:54.832
uh, I need you to leave
your phones in the car.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.401
Murielle: What?
Jamal: Are you fucking serious?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.069
I don't want it
interrupting the interviews

28:59.071 --> 29:00.404
or creating audio feedback.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.939
Murielle: Seriously?

29:01.941 --> 29:03.440
You can live without
it for a few hours.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.540
It won't kill you.

29:04.542 --> 29:05.909
Murielle:
Yeah, fine, okay.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.444
Jamal: I can't live
without mine.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.846
Jamal: You putting
up with all that?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.881
Murielle: This is so stupid.

29:10.883 --> 29:14.351
Jamal: This looks like
a straight-up crack house.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.854
Richard: Martha?

29:16.856 --> 29:17.921
Murielle: Oh, this is nasty.

29:17.923 --> 29:22.226
Richard:
Martha? Martha?

29:22.228 --> 29:25.395
Sorry, you talking to us?

29:25.397 --> 29:26.830
Jamal: Who the
hell is Martha?

29:26.832 --> 29:28.398
Murielle:

29:30.869 --> 29:33.170
You guys stay right here, okay?

29:33.172 --> 29:36.840
She has some times
that's really scary.

29:37.909 --> 29:38.976
Martha!

29:41.913 --> 29:43.347
Jamal: Who is Martha?

29:43.349 --> 29:45.315
Richard: Martha!

29:45.317 --> 29:47.284
I think he said it was his wife.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.953
Jamal: Oh shit,
look, look, look.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.189
Big brother's watching us.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.136
Come on, come on, come on.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.145
Ma'am?

30:18.517 --> 30:20.951
Jamal: Uh, um, Mr. rich?

30:20.953 --> 30:23.387
I think we found your old lady.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.359
Devon: Can you hear me?
The moon...

30:37.569 --> 30:39.169
- Devon: Is she okay?
- No!

30:39.171 --> 30:40.404
Murielle: Is there
anything we can do?

30:40.406 --> 30:41.471
Yeah, you know what?

30:41.473 --> 30:43.373
You can get out of the way

30:43.375 --> 30:46.310
and let me show you
the rest of the place, okay?

30:50.381 --> 30:53.183
You're going to just
interview people, right?

30:53.185 --> 30:54.251
Devon: Yeah.
Richard: Okay.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.886
Devon: Nothing fancy.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.354
All right, listen, I don't want
anyone going upstairs, okay?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.389
Especially up in the attic,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.892
because there's a lot
of rotten wood up there.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.161
Devon: I take full responsibility
for everybody's safety.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.597
Okay, and if
anybody gets hurt...

31:06.599 --> 31:09.333
You know, I'm not liable for it.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.968
Murielle: Is
there electricity?

31:10.970 --> 31:15.405
Yeah, all the, uh,
fixtures work and there's

31:15.407 --> 31:19.176
a fuse box downstairs in case
you want to do the power.

31:22.513 --> 31:24.448
Murielle: Jamal,
I think we should

31:24.450 --> 31:26.650
probably set up here right
in front of the fireplace...

31:30.222 --> 31:34.391
Richard:

31:34.393 --> 31:36.927
It's okay, it's okay.

31:40.398 --> 31:45.435
Sorry, she, uh, she gets
confused sometimes where she is.

31:45.437 --> 31:48.105
She gets scared too, so...

31:48.107 --> 31:51.508
Listen, I'm going to take off and get
her to her doctor's appointment.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.278
You have my, uh, house number.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.048
Devon: Trade
you for the keys.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.687
Try not to burn the place down.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.496
Devon: Powered up.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.631
Hey, Jamal, can you move that
diva left a little?

32:14.633 --> 32:15.699
Jamal: Huh?

32:15.701 --> 32:18.368
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.014
Murielle: Fuck, they're gonna
break already? Jamal: Shit.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.382
Damn.

32:37.021 --> 32:39.222
Jamal: What the
hell is all that stuff?

32:39.224 --> 32:43.360
Devon: Props. Something to,
uh, spice up the interviews.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.330
Murielle: Wow, what else have
you got in there, MacGyver?

32:46.332 --> 32:48.598
Devon:
The power of Christ.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.402
Jamal: What, no silver?

32:52.404 --> 32:54.304
Got that necklace
around your neck.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.174
Will you toss me a mag light?

32:58.242 --> 33:00.010
All right, which one
of you turkeys wants

33:00.012 --> 33:01.745
to come flip the
breaker with me?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.013
Gobble gobble.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.115
Hey, no offense, man.

33:05.117 --> 33:08.085
I'll take care of this one.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.486
Ready?
Murielle: Yeah.

33:17.295 --> 33:18.996
You know, I don't need you

33:18.998 --> 33:21.031
to protect me from him.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.200
Bryan: You know why Devon offered
you the job, though, right?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.634
I'm not an idiot.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.238
He says he's changed.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.007
Bryan: Oh, and
you believe him?

33:30.009 --> 33:32.676
What if nobody ever
gave you a second chance?

33:38.116 --> 33:39.182
Bryan: Great.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.617
Found it.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.425
Jamal: Action.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.064
We all love a good horror story.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.533
We like to pretend
the monsters are real,

33:56.535 --> 33:58.502
but what if they truly exist,

33:58.504 --> 34:00.704
living amongst us?

34:00.706 --> 34:02.606
Hi, my name is Devon Adams,

34:02.608 --> 34:04.541
creator of the monster project.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.411
Tonight, on this
rare lunar eclipse,

34:07.413 --> 34:09.246
we will interview
three strangers

34:09.248 --> 34:11.313
who claim to be
real-life monsters,

34:11.315 --> 34:15.418
a vampire, a demon,
and a skinwalker.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.289
No actors, no scripts,

34:19.291 --> 34:22.726
everything you are
about to witness is real.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.762
Cut, man, take it back.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.097
My voice was off.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.297
Jamal: Oh, my gosh, well,

34:28.300 --> 34:29.780
you sure as hell
ain't Morgan Freeman.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.402
Oh, shit, what is that?

34:34.105 --> 34:35.405
You heard that?

34:38.743 --> 34:41.311
We don't have much time.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.315
Shit.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.751
Jamal: Murielle!

34:57.128 --> 34:58.862
Murielle:
Devon, this is yours?

35:04.769 --> 35:08.371
Shiori, uh, early.

35:13.711 --> 35:16.680
But we're not quite set up yet.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.416
Would you mind waiting in
your dressing room?

35:20.651 --> 35:22.586
We, we don't mind.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.356
Devon: Great.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.191
Who the hell is we?

35:33.564 --> 35:36.466
I'm going to take
Shiori to the storeroom.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.335
Go tape these upstairs.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.536
Bryan: Vampire.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.671
What am I doing?

35:41.673 --> 35:42.906
All right, it's just one day.

35:42.908 --> 35:46.676
Be professional, you
don't need the pills.

35:49.581 --> 35:52.349
All right, skinwalker.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.921
Come on, all right.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.291
We got demon.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.593
All right, done.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.829
Hello?

36:07.265 --> 36:08.465
Anyone in there?

36:10.801 --> 36:13.303
Hello?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.340
Shiori?

36:20.311 --> 36:21.378
You okay?

36:22.313 --> 36:23.380
Shiori?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.450
Everything okay?

36:30.254 --> 36:31.488
Shit.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.260
Devon: Jamal?

36:37.262 --> 36:38.595
Jamal: What?

36:40.231 --> 36:41.665
Devon: Jamal, what the hell
are you doing?

36:41.667 --> 36:43.967
Jamal: What do you mean,
I'm on coyote watch!

36:43.969 --> 36:45.435
What?

36:48.539 --> 36:50.373
Jamal: Shit.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.542
I think I see something.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.978
Yo, Dev, come over here,
you gotta see this!

36:54.980 --> 36:56.780
What is it?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.223
Will you let me in?

37:11.629 --> 37:14.831
Jamal:
Hi, uh, welcome.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.833
Devon: I got this.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.635
You must be Shayla.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.936
In the flesh.

37:20.805 --> 37:23.240
Devon: Please, come in.

37:35.653 --> 37:37.754
Thank you for joining us.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.657
Thank you for your donation.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.393
I've come by for a second taste.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.264
Jamal: Yo, Bry,
you cool, bro?

37:47.266 --> 37:48.965
You look pale as fuck!

37:52.637 --> 37:54.304
What was that for?

37:57.475 --> 38:02.779
Just give me that...

38:02.781 --> 38:05.382
Fuck, you don't need
those fucking pills,

38:05.384 --> 38:07.517
just breathe, okay?

38:07.519 --> 38:09.819
Just breathe and
you'll be all right,

38:09.821 --> 38:11.821
you can handle one night.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.060
Shit!

38:18.929 --> 38:20.764
All right, fuck this.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.868
Fuck it. Just one.

38:35.012 --> 38:36.079
Steven: Hey.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.947
Shit.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.582
Steven: I see
what you got there.

38:39.584 --> 38:40.917
What are you talking about?

38:40.919 --> 38:42.819
Steven: The camera
on your forehead.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.721
They make us wear
bodycams now, too.

38:44.723 --> 38:48.091
Oh, yeah, no, I
just got mine today.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.727
Steven: Secrets used to be
easier to hide.

38:50.729 --> 38:51.795
Yeah.

38:56.934 --> 38:58.001
Steven.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.738
I'm so happy you could join us.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.677
The monster project,
scene one, take one.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.387
Devon: Hey, Bryan, I
think you're in the shot.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.661
And set.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.667
Thank you for
joining us, Steven.

39:30.669 --> 39:33.770
I understand you wish to conceal
your identity for your protection.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.108
Not my protection.

39:39.777 --> 39:40.877
Yours.

39:43.647 --> 39:45.782
I also understand it's forbidden

39:45.784 --> 39:48.385
for the Navajo to
discuss skinwalking.

39:48.387 --> 39:51.955
How would your people feel if
they knew you were talking to us?

39:53.824 --> 39:58.128
There would be an uproar.

39:58.130 --> 40:01.398
Devon: So why
are you doing this?

40:02.800 --> 40:03.867
Revenge.

40:06.804 --> 40:09.406
Aren't you a police officer?

40:09.408 --> 40:11.741
On the reservation.

40:11.743 --> 40:15.044
Devon: You
protect your people?

40:15.046 --> 40:17.414
From myself.

40:17.416 --> 40:21.017
From others like me.

40:21.886 --> 40:23.620
Devon: Skinwalkers?

40:23.622 --> 40:25.955
Yee naaldlooshii.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.023
Right.

40:28.826 --> 40:32.929
So how does one
become a skinwalker?

40:39.438 --> 40:40.438
Murder.

40:42.506 --> 40:44.066
Devon: Are you saying
you're a murderer?

40:47.945 --> 40:49.679
I am a skinwalker.

40:54.185 --> 41:00.223
My, uh, My research shows that

41:00.225 --> 41:02.692
you have to murder
a family member

41:02.694 --> 41:04.194
in order to become a skinwalker,

41:04.196 --> 41:07.964
you sell your soul to the devil.

41:07.966 --> 41:14.537
You have to kill, yes,
but you don't sell your soul.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.808
You make a pact for power.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.977
Have you ever shapeshifted?

41:20.979 --> 41:22.812
Steven: Of course.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.214
Is it painful?

41:26.984 --> 41:31.654
Your back hurts, your jaw.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.791
You can't feel anything else.

41:34.793 --> 41:38.962
Your mind splits in two.

41:38.964 --> 41:43.166
You give up everything that
makes you human.

41:44.201 --> 41:48.705
Become animal.

41:51.842 --> 41:52.942
Animal?

41:55.713 --> 41:59.015
Are you saying you're not in
control when you transform?

41:59.017 --> 42:00.083
No.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.620
No, no.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.023
Power blinds you.

42:07.791 --> 42:09.859
Only silver stops it.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.929
Would you call
yourself a monster?

42:20.271 --> 42:24.274
Um, would you mind
dimming the lights?

42:24.276 --> 42:27.277
Bryan, could you dim the lights?

42:31.048 --> 42:33.950
I got it.

42:42.693 --> 42:44.794
How's that?
Much better.

42:46.597 --> 42:47.931
Thank you.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.599
Murielle: How's that?

42:49.601 --> 42:50.667
Devon: Great.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.335
Let's get under way.

42:52.337 --> 42:58.007
Oh, um, if it's
all the same to you,

42:58.009 --> 43:01.244
I'd rather have him
ask me the questions.

43:03.681 --> 43:04.747
What?

43:05.683 --> 43:09.052
Devon: Uh, Bryan
has to roll sound.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.854
Oh, but can't you do it?

43:11.856 --> 43:15.058
I don't really talk
unless it's to him.

43:15.060 --> 43:18.027
The quiet ones are
always more fun.

43:21.365 --> 43:22.632
Sure.

43:22.634 --> 43:23.933
Bryan: No, I'm not...

43:23.935 --> 43:27.036
If you prefer to start that way.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.107
Shayla: Yeah, I do.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.352
How do I...

43:43.621 --> 43:44.988
Just ask, man.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.029
You don't have to
sit that far away,

43:53.031 --> 43:54.230
I don't bite.

43:54.232 --> 43:56.666
Bryan: Are you
sure about that?

43:56.668 --> 43:59.769
Oh, this is going to be fun.

43:59.771 --> 44:05.241
Um, So, What's your name?

44:06.010 --> 44:07.310
Call me Shayla.

44:08.245 --> 44:10.013
Bryan: Is that
your real name?

44:10.015 --> 44:12.081
Do I seem fake to you?

44:13.217 --> 44:15.885
Fake, well, um, you say

44:15.887 --> 44:18.021
that you're a vampire, so...

44:18.023 --> 44:20.323
Only for the sake of brevity.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.226
There are a lot of
misconceptions about my kind.

44:24.028 --> 44:26.062
Truth is more complicated.

44:28.432 --> 44:30.166
Bryan: Can we
start with the basics?

44:30.168 --> 44:34.237
Um, how old are you?

44:34.239 --> 44:38.107
Hm, it's rude to
ask a woman's age.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.176
I'm not ageless, if
that's what you mean.

44:40.178 --> 44:44.347
We all die, just
like we all bleed.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.948
Bryan: Can you
walk in the sunlight?

44:45.950 --> 44:47.183
Yes.

44:47.185 --> 44:50.953
Bryan: So you
don't burn or die or

44:50.955 --> 44:52.388
anything like that?

44:52.390 --> 44:54.023
God, no.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.959
Bryan: Then why
are you nocturnal?

44:58.328 --> 45:01.130
Have you ever
gone out all night,

45:01.132 --> 45:05.134
drinking, and you felt
like shit the next day?

45:05.136 --> 45:07.370
That's how I feel
in the sunlight.

45:07.372 --> 45:10.840
Hungover, sick,
everything stings,

45:10.842 --> 45:12.408
every noise is amplified.

45:12.410 --> 45:16.279
The sound of a busy
street, dogs barking,

45:16.281 --> 45:19.882
kids screaming, it's
grating on my ears.

45:21.251 --> 45:24.954
And then at night,
everything quiets down

45:24.956 --> 45:27.423
and I can hear myself think.

45:27.425 --> 45:29.926
It allows me to do my work.

45:31.161 --> 45:33.930
Uh, what do you do for a living?

45:33.932 --> 45:35.331
I'm an artist.

45:41.238 --> 45:45.041
Do you have any
tattoos I can't see?

45:45.043 --> 45:46.509
Um, one.

45:47.211 --> 45:48.411
Show me.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.258
J-s-s-r-k-n?

46:04.261 --> 46:05.862
Bryan: They're initials.

46:10.835 --> 46:12.168
Ex-girlfriends?

46:13.237 --> 46:14.470
Not exactly.

46:18.342 --> 46:21.244
So, How do you restrain yourself

46:21.246 --> 46:25.982
when your clients bleed?

46:27.351 --> 46:28.451
Oh.

46:29.553 --> 46:30.820
I don't.

46:32.156 --> 46:34.257
Restraint is not my strength.

46:34.259 --> 46:36.259
I can't resist a taste.

46:37.227 --> 46:39.295
I consider it a tip.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.964
Bryan: So you drink
blood to survive?

46:41.966 --> 46:43.833
Yes, but not in the
way you're thinking.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.002
Bryan: And what way is that?
Food.

46:46.004 --> 46:49.438
People need much more than
sustenance to survive.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.241
Caffeine, alcohol, sex.

46:53.177 --> 46:55.478
Drugs.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.282
You know the feeling, don't you?

46:59.284 --> 47:02.218
The warm rush in your veins,

47:02.220 --> 47:07.223
the euphoria, like you've just
been fucked by Athena.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.559
You know that
feeling, don't you?

47:09.561 --> 47:11.327
I know you know.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.529
You have been high before.

47:13.531 --> 47:14.597
Yeah.

47:15.532 --> 47:17.333
Then you know how
fleeting it is,

47:17.335 --> 47:19.268
how quickly the body acclimates,

47:19.270 --> 47:22.905
and how quickly the
wolf gets hungry again.

47:24.341 --> 47:28.244
I tasted your blood.

47:31.415 --> 47:34.951
Oxycontin, it was
never my favorite,

47:34.953 --> 47:36.986
but, you know, it
really dulls the pain.

47:36.988 --> 47:38.955
Jamal: Are you serious, bro?
The fuck is she talking about?

47:38.957 --> 47:40.556
I don't know what she's
talking about, she...

47:40.558 --> 47:42.458
Jamal: You've been lying to us the
whole fucking time? Oh, shit!

47:42.460 --> 47:45.261
Was that, was that a secret?

47:45.263 --> 47:48.931
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

47:48.933 --> 47:51.200
You shouldn't keep secrets.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.035
You know, just because
you turn your back

47:53.037 --> 47:54.937
on the devil, doesn't mean
he stops following you.

47:54.939 --> 47:56.505
Shut the fuck up!

47:56.507 --> 47:59.008
You are fucking lyin'!

47:59.010 --> 48:01.110
This is bullshit!

48:03.047 --> 48:06.115
Devon: Damn it, Bryan.
That's coming out of your pay!

48:06.117 --> 48:07.183
Your boy's losing it.

48:07.185 --> 48:08.384
Shayla: Bryan, come back.

48:08.386 --> 48:10.953
We need to make up.

48:10.955 --> 48:14.323
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I didn't know

48:14.325 --> 48:16.626
he was lying to all of you.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.504
It hurts again.

48:31.375 --> 48:32.441
Where are they?

48:32.443 --> 48:34.143
Bryan: What are
you talking about?

48:34.145 --> 48:36.412
You know what the fuck I'm talking about.
The pills, the Oxy?

48:36.414 --> 48:38.281
Bryan, I know you're high.

48:38.283 --> 48:39.649
Bryan: I don't have any
fucking pills!

48:39.651 --> 48:41.450
Your fucking pupils are dilated!

48:41.452 --> 48:43.352
Don't play with me.

48:43.354 --> 48:45.554
The fuck is this?
I knew you were lying!

48:45.556 --> 48:48.524
Bryan: Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm fucking sorry!

48:48.526 --> 48:50.626
Jamal: Damn it, Bry,
it's not about you!

48:50.628 --> 48:52.094
Just get out of
my fucking house.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.163
I'm not floating you
around for another month.

48:54.165 --> 48:56.265
Bryan: We're meant to be friends, we were
friends since we were fucking kids...

48:56.267 --> 48:59.468
Fuck you!
Fuck you, friends, friends?

48:59.470 --> 49:00.703
Listen, Devon didn't use me,

49:00.705 --> 49:01.971
you did!

49:01.973 --> 49:03.406
You lied straight to my face!

49:03.408 --> 49:06.042
You lied to everybody!

49:06.044 --> 49:09.378
Listen, man, you
made your choice.

49:09.380 --> 49:12.248
Don't blame me for making mine.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.516
Man, find your way out back.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.518
I don't need you fucking up
more of my shots.

49:19.123 --> 49:20.656
Here's a v-log, mom and dad.

49:20.658 --> 49:22.959
Take a good look at your son!

49:22.961 --> 49:26.295
Your fuck-up, junkie son,

49:26.297 --> 49:28.731
who can't even go a
day without a dose!

49:28.733 --> 49:31.334
Don't it just make you proud?

49:31.336 --> 49:33.602
God damn it!

49:36.106 --> 49:37.173
Fuck!

49:43.347 --> 49:44.613
Fuck!

49:54.324 --> 49:56.525
I didn't mean to take
your name in vain.

49:57.627 --> 49:59.628
I'm just weak!

50:09.306 --> 50:10.373
I need it.

50:15.145 --> 50:16.545
Murielle: Are you okay?

50:16.547 --> 50:17.780
Jamal: I'm good. I don't
even want to talk about it.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.048
Let's just finish this.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.383
Devon: Okay.

50:22.252 --> 50:24.787
Please say your name for camera.

50:27.391 --> 50:31.227
Shiori.

50:31.229 --> 50:34.330
Devon: And you believe you're
possessed by a demon, Shiori?

50:40.537 --> 50:42.538
I want it to go away.

50:44.574 --> 50:46.242
Devon: Who?

50:46.244 --> 50:47.476
The bad man.

50:49.279 --> 50:51.180
He promised

50:51.182 --> 50:53.416
if we come here

50:53.418 --> 50:55.284
and talk to you

50:55.286 --> 50:57.553
he'll leave.

51:00.357 --> 51:03.259
Devon: How long have
you known the bad man?

51:03.261 --> 51:04.326
Always.

51:05.629 --> 51:07.463
Since we were born.

51:10.500 --> 51:13.536
Devon: Is he
here with us now?

51:20.410 --> 51:21.577
He's close.

51:26.616 --> 51:28.784
Have you ever seen him?

51:33.623 --> 51:36.625
Can you tell me
what he looks like?

51:40.530 --> 51:41.597
He's

51:42.566 --> 51:43.632
smiling.

51:45.435 --> 51:47.870
Always smiling.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.607
He has no lips.

51:53.710 --> 51:56.112
His eyes are big.

51:57.747 --> 52:01.550
He looks like an animal.

52:05.388 --> 52:07.656
Devon: Why do you call it he?

52:07.658 --> 52:10.459
He holds us down at night.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.561
Forces himself inside.

52:15.632 --> 52:18.467
Is this a nightmare you have?

52:24.441 --> 52:26.509
He scratches me.

52:31.281 --> 52:32.515
Murielle: Oh, my god.

52:32.584 --> 52:33.483
Poor thing.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.519
Devon: Did you do
that to yourself, Shiori?

52:36.521 --> 52:38.454
God hates us.

52:38.456 --> 52:40.723
Jamal: What?

52:45.562 --> 52:47.429
I see him.

52:47.431 --> 52:48.497
Go away!

52:49.299 --> 52:50.566
I know what you want!

52:50.568 --> 52:51.634
Go away!

52:53.638 --> 52:55.538
Jamal: What is
she screaming for?

52:55.540 --> 52:57.840
Murielle: Hey,
there's nothing there!

52:57.842 --> 53:00.309
Shiori, it's okay,
there's nothing there!

53:00.311 --> 53:01.844
Jamal: She's
got to calm down!

53:04.447 --> 53:05.848
Devon: Murielle,
get the power back on!

53:05.850 --> 53:08.584
Murielle: I'm on it, I'm
on it, just chill out!

53:12.656 --> 53:15.257
Hang on, it's going to be okay.

53:15.259 --> 53:18.294
Just take care of her,
I'll be right back!

53:18.296 --> 53:19.795
Need some help?
No, I got this.

53:19.797 --> 53:21.864
I got it, I got it.

53:44.354 --> 53:45.888
Hey, are you okay?

53:59.503 --> 54:00.769
I'll go get help!

54:04.674 --> 54:06.442
Oh, my god.

54:21.558 --> 54:22.791
Devon: Murielle,
what's going on?

54:22.793 --> 54:24.026
Murielle: We
need to leave now!

54:24.028 --> 54:25.461
Devon: Why?

54:27.897 --> 54:28.964
Jamal: What
the hell was that?

54:28.966 --> 54:30.332
Devon: Murielle,
what's going on?

54:30.334 --> 54:32.968
Murielle: Shiori,
come with us.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.036
Shiori?

54:37.607 --> 54:38.741
Jamal: Shit!

54:40.010 --> 54:41.777
Devon: This way,
guys, come on!

54:41.779 --> 54:42.845
Come on!

54:42.847 --> 54:44.647
Jamal: Oh, my god,
she's gone crazy!

54:44.649 --> 54:46.682
Devon: I don't have
the keys for this door!

54:50.920 --> 54:51.987
Murielle, come on!

55:04.635 --> 55:06.702
Devon: We gotta go, come on!

55:15.645 --> 55:17.446
What the fuck are those things?

55:17.448 --> 55:19.348
Murielle: Devon,
what do we do?

55:19.350 --> 55:22.051
Monsters aren't real!

55:32.962 --> 55:34.697
Bryan: Shit, what's that?

55:34.699 --> 55:36.632
Jamal, is that you?

55:37.734 --> 55:38.834
The fuck?

55:43.340 --> 55:45.941
Murielle: Jamal!
Devon: Go, go!

55:50.747 --> 55:53.082
Murielle: Go, go!

55:53.084 --> 55:54.717
We have to go back for him!

55:54.719 --> 55:56.085
We have... Devon: No, no,
we need to call the cops!

55:56.087 --> 55:57.820
Murielle: He'll be dead
by the time they get here!

55:57.822 --> 55:58.887
We're his only chance!

55:58.889 --> 56:00.089
We don't stand a chance!

56:00.091 --> 56:01.957
Bryan: I saw those things!
Devon: Saw what?

56:01.959 --> 56:04.093
Bryan, we're leaving now!

56:04.095 --> 56:05.761
Murielle: Bryan, Jamal's
hurt inside the house!

56:05.763 --> 56:07.863
We have to... What the fuck
are you talking about?

56:07.865 --> 56:10.905
Murielle: Those people that we brought
here to interview, they're not people!

56:12.403 --> 56:14.603
Bryan: Fuck! Devon: No,
don't go back in there!

56:19.776 --> 56:21.744
Bryan: Jesus Christ.

56:21.746 --> 56:24.426
Devon: You still think we're messing
with you? Bryan: Is that blood?

56:24.914 --> 56:26.749
Where's Jamal?

56:26.751 --> 56:28.717
Devon: Over here,
Bryan, give me your hand.

56:28.719 --> 56:29.818
Come on.

56:32.422 --> 56:34.757
Vampire stake, holy
water, salt, knife,

56:34.759 --> 56:36.058
everything we need is in there.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.861
Here, you should
know how to use that.

56:38.863 --> 56:40.129
I got the stake.

56:40.131 --> 56:41.730
Bryan: Jamal!

56:44.801 --> 56:46.735
Devon: Bryan, don't go...
Murielle: Wait!

56:51.575 --> 56:52.908
Bryan: Jamal!

56:52.910 --> 56:54.410
Murielle: Bryan!

56:58.782 --> 56:59.848
You hear that?

57:14.664 --> 57:15.831
Bryan: What's her name again?

57:15.833 --> 57:16.899
Shiori.

57:19.836 --> 57:22.137
Bryan: Shiori?

57:25.008 --> 57:26.909
Devon: Wait,
don't go near her.

57:26.911 --> 57:27.976
Stay back.

57:30.680 --> 57:31.747
I got this.

57:32.549 --> 57:34.917
Shiori, Shiori?

57:35.919 --> 57:38.187
Just listen to me, okay?

57:38.189 --> 57:39.888
Shiori, just listen to me.

57:39.890 --> 57:42.157
I promise, okay?

57:42.159 --> 57:44.626
Everything's going
to be all right.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.595
Just trust me.

57:46.597 --> 57:49.898
Shiori, Shiori?

57:50.467 --> 57:51.533
Trust me.

57:52.168 --> 57:54.102
It's going to be okay.

57:59.576 --> 58:00.642
Devon: Bryan!

58:00.644 --> 58:02.044
Murielle: Bryan!

58:03.947 --> 58:06.114
Devon: Come on, buddy.

58:08.985 --> 58:10.052
Murielle: Are you okay?

58:10.054 --> 58:11.920
Bryan: I'm fine.

58:15.226 --> 58:16.592
Murielle: Oh my god,
that's him.

58:16.594 --> 58:18.594
He's upstairs, come on!

58:19.929 --> 58:21.930
Devon: Jamal!

58:21.932 --> 58:23.632
Jamal, talk to me!

58:23.634 --> 58:24.700
Where are you?

58:24.702 --> 58:27.102
Murielle: Jamal,
tell us where you are!

58:28.104 --> 58:29.171
Devon: Jamal!

58:32.509 --> 58:34.977
Don't shoot, it's us!

58:34.979 --> 58:36.245
Devon: It's okay, man.

58:36.247 --> 58:38.280
Murielle: Oh, my god,
you're alive.

58:38.282 --> 58:40.782
Devon: Hey, hey!
Easy, easy, easy.

58:40.784 --> 58:43.085
Fuck. Devon: Hey, talk to me, man.
What's wrong?

58:43.087 --> 58:44.152
Shit.

58:44.154 --> 58:45.554
Devon: Holy shit.

58:45.556 --> 58:46.722
Bryan: Man, are you all right?

58:46.724 --> 58:48.056
What the fuck happened?

58:48.058 --> 58:50.192
Jamal: No, it feels amazing.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.627
What are you doing up here?

58:51.629 --> 58:53.727
Well, I came back to
save your ass, didn't I?

58:53.729 --> 58:56.665
Devon: I thought you were dead. How
did you get away from that thing?

58:56.667 --> 58:58.901
I must have grabbed the gun
from the holster.

58:58.903 --> 59:00.536
I put four rounds in his ass,

59:00.538 --> 59:03.772
motherfucker still
wouldn't go down.

59:03.774 --> 59:05.140
I don't think we're
gonna make it out.

59:05.142 --> 59:07.309
Murielle: Hey,
don't say that, okay?

59:10.714 --> 59:13.682
Murielle: Got you,
got you, shit!

59:13.684 --> 59:16.852
Bryan: Come on, man, get up.

59:16.854 --> 59:19.021
Devon: You don't
get to hold the gun.

59:23.660 --> 59:24.993
You see anything?

59:24.995 --> 59:26.595
Murielle: I got you.
Devon: You see anything?

59:26.597 --> 59:29.731
Murielle: Okay, okay.

59:42.912 --> 59:44.746
Murielle: Oh, shit!

59:58.061 --> 59:59.895
Bryan: Murielle!

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.001
Devon: You okay?

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:14.876
Bryan: Why didn't
you shoot her?

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:16.111
Devon: Because I
was helping Jamal.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:18.246
Don't worry about
me, get Murielle!

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.349
Bryan: The gun won't work,
you have to use the stake!

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:23.218
Devon: If you want to get close enough
to stake her, then be my guest.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.191
Jamal: Shoot her!

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:04.760
Bryan: Jamal!

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:06.228
Bring me the stake!

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.065
Jamal!

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.237
Jamal: Taste this, bitch!

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.690
Bryan: The fuck.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.166
You bitch.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.278
Devon: What
the hell happened?

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.014
Jamal: My ass just saved the
motherfuckin' day.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.082
Oh, man.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.184
Murielle: Jamal?

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:04.152
Bryan?

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.888
Jamal: Shit, so much for the
black guy going out first.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.961
Bryan: For being fuckin' dead
she's pretty fast, man, you okay?

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:15.163
Jamal: Don't worry about me.
What about your neck?

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.866
That bitch tried to
drink me like fucking milk.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.437
Bryan: Give me the gun.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:25.107
Jamal: Be careful,
Bryan, be careful!

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:26.408
Bryan: Everyone, stay back.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.009
Murielle: What's that noise?

01:02:28.011 --> 01:02:29.778
Bryan: Sounds like hammering.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.461
Devon: Jamal, get the door!

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.475
Jamal: Bullets don't do shit,

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:02.144
just piss it off!

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:03.144
Bryan: We're out.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.113
Murielle: How do you fucking
can you kill that thing?

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.149
Shit, who can kill
the motherfucker?

01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:08.950
Bryan: You said
something about silver.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.185
Only silver kills him.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:13.355
Devon: Hey, maybe we
don't have to kill it.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:15.123
Maybe we can go around.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.458
Come on, this way.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.526
Jamal: Come on.

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:19.795
Murielle: You got it.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:39.314
Jamal: You guys hear that?

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.517
Murielle: I think it's Shiori.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.286
Devon: You still
got that cross?

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:46.054
Bryan:
Yeah, I got it.

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:50.292
All right, Jamal, get behind me.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.360
Just like we do.

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:53.595
Jamal: Okay, gotcha.

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:56.164
Bryan: You ready?

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.933
Jamal: Yeah.
Bryan: All right.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.304
Go!

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:15.517
Jamal: Be careful, Murielle.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.552
Be careful.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.358
Devon: Stay back.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.894
She might still be possessed.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.195
Jamal: You still got bullets?

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.097
Murielle:
That's not funny, Jamal.

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.298
What do we do with her?

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.499
Devon: Her eyes look clear.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.401
She can't fight
this demon for long.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.470
It takes over again...

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.439
Bryan: Then we
fucking leave her.

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:39.608
Murielle: We can't just
leave her here to die.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.612
Shiori: I'm scared.

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:45.013
Devon: Me too.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.081
Bryan, take this.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.148
Run.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:48.216
Jamal: We gotta go!

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.378
Shiori: He
won't let us leave.

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:00.061
Devon: Keep moving!

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:12.974
Devon: Fuck, it won't open!

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:20.515
Bryan: Come on,
hurry, this way!

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.417
Come on, move!

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.619
Come on, hurry, move!

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.589
Jamal, move, move!

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:33.295
Jamal: Ugly motherfucker!

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.566
Move!

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:41.036
Devon:
You're okay, you're okay.

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:43.038
Stay right here.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.607
Murielle: We're all
going to die down here.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:49.277
Jamal: It's okay,
Murielle, it's okay.

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.481
Holy shit!

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.720
Bryan: It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.225
The walls are not boarded up, but
they're sealed with concrete.

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:06.294
I told you
he won't let us leave.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.662
That doesn't make any sense.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:09.097
I unlocked the door, but
it still wouldn't open.

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:10.165
So what are you saying?

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:11.232
We're locked in from outside!

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:12.634
It's the hammering
we heard outside.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.103
Murielle: We're
going to die down here.

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:17.372
Bryan: Hey, hey, look at me,

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:19.607
I'll find us a way
out, I promise.

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.978
Get out of my way!

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.617
Devon: Bryan...

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:31.686
Bryan: I
heard you the first time!

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.355
Give me your flashlight, okay?

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:34.589
Come on, come on.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:35.690
Come on!

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.095
Jamal: I can't see shit.

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:41.295
Bryan: Can you see that?

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.765
Murielle: You guys, we
should not be down here.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.004
Bryan: I see a way out!

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:50.405
Jamal: Where?

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.344
Murielle: Bryan, be careful!

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.053
Bryan, you see anything?

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:27.742
Fuck.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.311
Jamal: What do you see?

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:31.679
Bryan!

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:32.747
Hurry up!

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.354
Bryan: There's
something out there!

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.793
Murielle: Where's Shiori?

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.764
Murielle: Bryan,
get out of there!

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:51.399
Devon: Where is she?

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.667
Murielle: Get
out of there, Bryan!

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:55.236
Jamal: Bryan, get
back, it's Shiori!

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.612
Murielle: We gotta go, Bryan!

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:35.143
Shiori/demon: Time to
pay for your sins, Bryan.

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.750
Devon: Use the holy water!

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.263
Murielle: Jesus,
where did she go?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.300
Bryan: There's
something out there, too!

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:04.372
Devon: Maybe we can get out
through the second floor window.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.439
Murielle: What about Shiori?

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:07.609
Devon: We'll lock her in!

01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:27.828
Devon: Bryan, the cross!

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:28.897
What did I do with it?

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.165
Devon: Pray!

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.301
Our father, who art in heaven,

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.935
hallowed be thy name.

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:37.671
You will pay for
your sins, Bryan.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.407
They kingdom
come, thy will be done,

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.475
in earth as it is in heaven.

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:42.676
Forgive us our trespasses,

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.580
and those who
trespass against us.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:06.734
Bryan: Murielle?

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:09.571
Happy birthday.

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:17.378
Bryan: Wait,
what's happening?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.280
What the hell is this?

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.883
This can't be real.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.785
Demon: Make a wish.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.954
Who is that?

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.965
Where are you?

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:39.601
It's not real, it's not real.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:43.538
Shiori?

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:46.708
Shiori?

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:50.945
What's going on?

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.316
What are you doing here?

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:58.686
Where are we?

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:01.289
Demon: You fucking coward!

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:11.032
Happy birthday, Bryan.

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:12.800
Sorry I missed it.

01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:16.437
Bryan: I'm sorry.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.706
It wasn't your
fault, it was mine.

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:23.478
Hey Bryan, you were right, man.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.812
That stuff you sold us

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.682
was really good shit!

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.050
Bryan: I didn't
know the batch was bad.

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:30.752
I'm sorry.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:33.388
You still
got that coming, Bryan.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:35.890
I hear sex is so much better

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:37.625
when you're high.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:40.695
Makes you feel alive.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:50.638
I want to feel alive again.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.774
Bryan: No, don't, stop!

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:55.009
Look, I'm sorry!
It should have been me!

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.077
No!

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:57.345
Murderer!

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:02.417
Bryan: No, get
out of my head!

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:07.388
Demon: James Sanders,
Samuel Ross,

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.657
Karen Nathan.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:12.894
You killed them all, Bryan.

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:15.697
Bryan: No, I was
trying to help them!

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.398
You sold them their poison

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.734
and now they're dead.

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:21.669
Your drugs killed them.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.738
Bryan: No, I didn't mean to.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.540
I didn't think anything
bad would happen!

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:29.444
You thought wrong, murderer.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:32.714
Murderer, murderer!

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.759
Bryan: Get away!

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:50.865
Get away!

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.774
Bryan, are you okay?

01:13:00.844 --> 01:13:01.943
Bryan: What happened?

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:03.544
What the hell happened?

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:09.817
Jamal: Bryan,
finish the prayer now!

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:13.855
Bryan: And lead us
not into temptation!

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:16.457
Your friends are waiting
for you in hell, Bryan!

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:17.692
Bryan: Deliver us from evil,

01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:18.760
for thine is the kingdom!

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:20.661
The power and the glory forever!

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:22.430
Just like I will be!

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:23.531
Bryan: Amen!

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:48.756
Murielle: What
happened to her?

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:04.605
Devon: Jesus,
that's even worse.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.875
Jamal: Hell no,
the bitch ain't dead.

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:13.080
Jamal: What's happening to her?

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.883
Do something, help her!
Please!

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:25.593
Murielle/demon: I will take
everything from you, Bryan.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:27.829
Everything you love.

01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:29.697
That is not my name.

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.166
I am the demon Baphomet,

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:34.869
Baphomet, Baphomet, Baphomet.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.875
Bryan: I accept Jesus Christ,

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:43.978
the holy son who's
crucified, died, and buried,

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.515
descended into hell and
rose again from the dead!

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:51.152
She will die, you will all die.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.087
Descended into
heaven and now sits

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.722
at the right hand of god,

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.257
the father almighty.

01:14:57.259 --> 01:15:01.529
God cannot save this world.

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:06.133
He is coming.

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.670
Bryan: Murielle?

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.040
Devon: Murielle?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.578
Who's he?

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:30.892
Devon: Kill her,
kill her with the cross!

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:34.228
Now!

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.671
Is she dead?

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:50.645
It's over.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.887
Bryan: Murielle?

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:06.260
Devon: Hey,
give me your hand.

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.565
Bryan: Hey, it's
okay, it's Bryan.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.639
What happened?

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.146
Bryan: It's okay.

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.014
It's all right.

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.586
Where is Jamal?

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:34.789
Devon: Jamal?

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:39.060
Bryan: Jamal?

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:40.661
Devon: Jamal?

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:43.731
Bryan: Jamal?

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:46.834
Murielle: Jamal? Jamal?

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:50.771
Devon: Jamal?

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:54.108
Murielle: Where are you?

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.176
Devon: Oh, god.

01:16:55.178 --> 01:16:56.243
Stay back.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.680
Don't look at me.

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:02.116
Bryan: Listen, man,
it's going to be okay.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.318
Jamal: My back, it hurts.

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.723
I think I need to
go to the hospital.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:11.025
Bryan: We're going to get you
the fuck out of here, I promise.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.293
Just grab my arm.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.329
Jamal: It hurts.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:25.940
Murielle: Get upstairs,
get upstairs now!

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:29.377
Devon: Come on! Come on!

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.383
Bryan: Yes, you can, all right,
I'm not leaving you behind.

01:17:35.385 --> 01:17:37.652
Jamal: Bryan, I'm dying.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:40.688
Bryan: You never gave
up on me, now come on!

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:41.756
Jamal: Yes, I did!

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:42.823
Just go!

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.192
Make sure Murielle
gets out safe!

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.731
Devon: Murielle, move!

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:55.269
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:02.977
Get up! Get up, Murielle.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:05.379
Just me, come on, come on.

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:08.049
Jamal?

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:11.719
Hey, come on, I'm going to
get you out of here, all right?

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:14.121
Hey, look at me.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.924
Bryan, I'm sick.

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:19.960
I know, I'm going to get you out
of here, all right, I promise you.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:27.168
Devon: Shit, get her out!

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:32.006
Bryan: Hey!

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:39.974
Devon:

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:46.113
Do you think it got Bryan?

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:49.984
Yes.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:13.207
What's happening to me?

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.812
You were bit.

01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:18.946
You're dying.

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:26.520
Help me.

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:30.324
Please someone help me.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:38.132
Please help me, help me.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:43.170
Devon: I always told you
you were part of the plan.

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:51.045
Murielle:
Help me!

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:28.916
Bryan: Who the fuck are you?

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:30.217
He is coming.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:34.188
Fuck you!

01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:40.027
Bryan: Murielle, Murielle!

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.405
No, no, no, no, no!

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:53.540
No, no!

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:33.540
Bryan: I'm sorry
I couldn't save you.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.607
Come on, come on!

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.747
Oh, shit!

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:36.650
Bryan:
What the fuck?

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.044
Devon.

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:17.391
Devon: Like music, isn't it?

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.327
A master orchestration.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.031
What is all this?

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:29.336
Wow, those drugs really did
make you slow.

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:37.444
There's no way out, Bryan.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.418
And god can't save you.

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.374
Devon: Oh, stop it.

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:24.691
Bryan: God,
creator of all things.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.992
Devon: Enough!

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:12.672
It was you, you killed them.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:19.780
Do you see blood on my hands?

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.716
What about Murielle?

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:26.686
Devon: What about her?

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.956
I thought you loved her.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.459
Love.

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:37.564
Love is sacrifice, Bryan.

01:30:37.566 --> 01:30:40.434
I needed her, I
needed all of you.

01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:42.903
The crew, the monsters,
the lunar eclipse,

01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:45.872
even this particular house
was all part of the plan.

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:48.708
You all had to
die on this night.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.578
I couldn't kill
any of you myself

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.547
for the ritual,

01:30:53.549 --> 01:30:55.849
but I provided you
with the weapons,

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:58.151
perfect scenario,

01:30:58.153 --> 01:31:02.789
and you performed your
roles wonderfully.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.892
You see, Bryan,
the documentary...

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:07.994
isn't what you think it is.

01:31:07.996 --> 01:31:09.496
Hey, it's okay.

01:31:09.498 --> 01:31:12.799
It's okay.

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.236
It's okay.

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.974
I need you look at me

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:22.876
and I want you to see.

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.853
Why me?

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:37.190
Because you believe in god.

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:39.793
You're razed with this

01:31:39.795 --> 01:31:41.895
and I want him to see this.

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:45.699
You hear me?

01:31:45.701 --> 01:31:46.933
I want you to see this.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:54.541
I want you all to see this.

01:31:54.543 --> 01:31:55.609
See what?

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:58.044
Devon: My rise.

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:09.256
Anoint the head of your king.

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:24.204
In the name of Satan,

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:26.540
Luciferis Sentus,

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:29.309
desolation of man,

01:32:29.311 --> 01:32:32.712
god of hellfire,

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:35.882
defiler of innocence,
we your children

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:37.918
invoke you tonight.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.921
Oh, radiant father, by the moon

01:32:40.923 --> 01:32:43.690
this fallen king shall rise

01:32:43.692 --> 01:32:46.259
from the fires of hell

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:50.997
and claim this world,
his birthright.

01:32:50.999 --> 01:32:56.136
Those that burn,
bow onto thy fury

01:32:56.138 --> 01:32:58.271
and thy wisdom.
Shall lead me up

01:32:58.273 --> 01:33:01.908
into the green pastures.
And the angels lift death

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.877
on the angels and they...

01:33:03.879 --> 01:33:06.012
You restore our souls!
And burial shroud...

01:33:06.014 --> 01:33:07.280
And you will lead me
to the path!

01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:09.849
Flame eternal!

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:12.919
Damn ye to god!

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:29.135
Richard: So, it is done.

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:33.073
Thank you, Martha.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:39.179
The antichrist cometh.

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.121
Richard: Yes.
