01:50.240 --> 01:52.151
So how long's this been going on for?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.513
I don't know.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.039
A few weeks?

01:57.080 --> 01:58.991
- A long time.
- A year?

02:02.280 --> 02:03.952
I suppose so.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.592
A whole year?

02:05.640 --> 02:08.632
You've taken your time to come
and see me, haven't you?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.431
You think it's going to stop, don't you?

02:10.479 --> 02:12.277
I'll just take your blood pressure.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.356
Can you pop your arm on the desk
for me?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.594
There you go.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.313
If you straighten it up
and push up your sleeve...

02:19.800 --> 02:21.711
Are you dozing in the daytime?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.753
Sometimes.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.069
So, I just need something
to help me sleep.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.033
I know. How much sleep
are you getting at night?

02:31.080 --> 02:33.150
I'm not getting any. That's why I'm here.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.111
I understand, sweetheart.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.671
OK. It's just going to go tight.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.759
Have you got any particular worries
at the moment?

02:56.360 --> 02:58.271
No financial problems?

02:58.320 --> 03:00.709
No. I don't know
what that's got to do with it.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.631
What about at home?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.511
How are things with husband?

03:09.360 --> 03:13.478
OK, if you just lean forward and take a
few deep breaths, in through your mouth.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.477
And again.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.231
It's lovely and clear.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.911
- Have you got any kids?
- Yes.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.191
- Are they still at home with you?
- Son is, works with his father.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.879
Daughter's left, only see her
when she wants something.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.117
And how about you?
Have you started your menopause?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.309
Yes.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.792
Everything OK?

03:52.840 --> 03:54.956
So, will you give me some sleeping tablets?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.355
Maybe, but it might not solve your problem.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.709
Give me a night's sleep, though,
wouldn't it?

03:59.760 --> 04:03.070
- How much alcohol are you drinking?
- I don't drink. My husband drinks.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.473
Is it a problem?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.555
No.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.556
Are you taking any drugs, medication?

04:10.720 --> 04:12.233
How about coffee?

04:12.280 --> 04:14.350
Are you drinking a lot to keep awake?

04:14.400 --> 04:15.753
Coffee, yes.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.869
- Tea?
- Yes.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.559
Well, we might have to look at that,
mightn't we?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.398
OK.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.149
Your blood pressure is slightly up,
but I'm not overly concerned about that.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.272
But I do want you to have a blood test,
to check your thyroid.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.153
You can make an appointment at reception.
All right?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.189
Yes.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.673
Now, I will give you something to help
you sleep but just enough for a week.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.439
- What good's that?
- Insomnia isn't a disease.

04:45.480 --> 04:49.234
Sleeping tablets won't make it go away.
We need to find the cause.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.316
Now, you're obviously anxious,
and a little depressed.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.198
So I want you to come back
and speak to our counsellor.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.639
- What for?
- I think she'd be able to help you.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.470
But you'll give me the prescription now?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.831
Yes, but will you see the counsellor?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.831
I think it will do you some good.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.311
You think about it for a moment.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.552
Tom!

05:41.600 --> 05:43.511
Give us it.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.031
- Don't do your back in.
- I know.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.398
It doesn't get any easier.
Job for a younger man, this.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.151
Joe used to love it here.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.314
Did you speak to my son and heir?

06:38.360 --> 06:40.510
I left him a message on his answerphone.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.431
It's going to rain again.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.551
- Now, then.
- Hello, boss.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.071
- What you got?
- You hit rock, then?

07:35.960 --> 07:39.350
Yeah, we just gone through.
This is the fourth, so I reckon, what, 17½?

07:39.400 --> 07:40.435
Give or take.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.517
- 17½? It's got to be a scour hollow.
- Probably.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.039
- All right, Mick?
- All right.

07:45.080 --> 07:45.956
Hello.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.916
How long will it take us to get back?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.679
- 25, with traffic. Are you hungry?
- I am.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.233
Good.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.911
There you go.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.756
Yes, London clay. Thank you.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.518
- Thanks, Andy. See you.
- Cheers.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.675
Ta-ta.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.831
- Dusting of mica.
- Let's have a look.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.551
Hmm, it's quite nice.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.591
Very nice.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.710
- It's just a dusting, isn't it?
- Yeah.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.838
What would you say was the happiest
moment in your life?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.671
What do you mean?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.831
Your nicest memory.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.271
Have a think.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.631
When your children were born?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.276
- Your wedding day?
- I don't know.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.751
Take your time.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.518
I can't remember.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.676
- Can't or won't?
- Mm?

09:30.400 --> 09:31.992
Can't or won't remember?

09:32.040 --> 09:34.918
Don't know what I'm doing here.
I didn't want to come.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.190
Don't want to talk about my family.
Why should I?

09:37.240 --> 09:40.038
None of your business.
All I need is a good night's sleep

09:40.080 --> 09:41.798
and nobody's helping me.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.479
Janet, I want to help you.
That's why we're here.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.593
I know it's not easy
to talk about personal things.

09:49.920 --> 09:54.072
Suppose the boot was on the other foot,
and someone came to you,

09:54.120 --> 09:58.875
say, your daughter, and said,
"I haven't been sleeping for months."

09:58.920 --> 10:00.797
What would you say to them?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.751
"Go to the doctor."

10:02.800 --> 10:04.711
What else would you say?

10:06.280 --> 10:07.474
I don't know.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.078
What would you ask her?

10:12.360 --> 10:15.511
Is she eating all right?
I don't know, something like that.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.154
Good.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.318
Anything else?

10:22.520 --> 10:25.080
That a couple of months of proper sleep
would sort it out.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.997
Sort what out?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.518
The sleeping.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.834
OK.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.351
On a scale of one to ten...

10:38.080 --> 10:40.150
...how happy
would you say you are, Janet?

10:40.200 --> 10:42.111
- One.
- One.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.548
I think there's room for improvement there,
don't you?

10:46.120 --> 10:49.829
What is the one thing that would improve
your life, apart from sleep?

10:50.640 --> 10:53.234
- A different life.
- A different life.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.631
Change is frightening, isn't it?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.831
Nothing changes.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.949
Hope to see you next week, Janet.
Same time.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.389
I'll be here, but it's up to you. No pressure.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.755
Bye.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.711
- Bye-bye, Sam.
- Bye.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.392
Look at you!

11:28.440 --> 11:30.112
You look like you're fit to burst.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.958
I am fit to burst.
Big boy's wrestling his way down.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.911
If he pops out, give me a shout.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.116
Sweetheart, I'll do more than shout.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.350
- Hi, Gerri.
- Hello, Mary.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.311
You're a sight for sore eyes.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.310
- Can you process these for me?
- Oh, well, seeing as it's you.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.669
- How are you?
- I'm snowed under, to be honest,

11:50.720 --> 11:52.358
and I've got a headache.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.516
Have you seen the doctor?

11:54.560 --> 11:55.834
Hello, Gemma.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.632
Do you fancy a drink tonight?

11:57.680 --> 11:59.272
- I'd love one.
- Great. Are you sure?

11:59.320 --> 12:01.276
- I've only got an hour.
- That's all right.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.470
- Tom's cooking supper.
- Oh, lovely.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.431
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.153
Do you know, Gerri, I've never been with
a man who could cook.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.031
- Haven't you?
- No.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.799
- They could do other things.
- That doesn't get you fed.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.229
No, it keeps a girl happy, though.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.669
- And you can't cook.
- No. Well, I can a bit.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.109
- But it's not really my thing.
- No, it's not.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.555
Oh, no, don't remind me about that,
Gerri.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.109
You could put an ad in the paper
"Chef wanted".

12:40.160 --> 12:44.756
Yeah. "Chef/boyfriend
required for gorgeous girl."

12:44.800 --> 12:46.711
No, "Mature woman with cat."

12:48.680 --> 12:51.478
No, "Maturish".
We don't want to put them off, do we?

12:58.080 --> 13:00.753
It's lovely the way you and Tom
do everything together.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.951
- We're very lucky.
- Yeah. You are, but you deserve it.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.470
- You're both such lovely people.
- Oops, my halo's slipping.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.431
Yeah, Saint Gerri.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.715
No, but I'm really comfortable
with where I am in my life, as you know.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.228
I've got my lovely little garden flat,
a good job.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.590
I've got my health, touch wood,
I've got my independence.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.154
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not all rosy.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.556
I have good days and bad days
like everyone else, but, hey!

13:25.600 --> 13:28.034
Are you going to do something
about your garden?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.674
Oh, don't remind me!
I'm really guilty about that.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.109
- I've neglected it, haven't I?
- Yes, you have.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.550
But yesterday I was brushing my teeth
and I looked out the window

13:36.600 --> 13:39.751
and I saw these two daffodils
peeping over the top of the grass.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.028
I must get it cut.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.991
- Get yourself that lawn mower.
- I know.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.679
Couldn't I just get a man in?
It wouldn't cost much.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.077
- Hmm. "Gardener/chef/ boyfriend."
- Yeah!

13:50.120 --> 13:54.716
But I don't want to spend too much money
because I'm going to get myself a little car.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.194
- Are you?
- Yeah, I've decided it's about time.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.595
- It's a big step.
- I know. It's exciting, isn't it?

13:59.640 --> 14:02.518
I mean, I've got a little bit of money.
Not a lot, but enough.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.869
But I'll have to cut back on, you know,

14:04.920 --> 14:07.480
shoes, clothes, jewellery,
my knick-knacky things.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.308
But that's OK because I've got loads of
clothes. My wardrobe isn't big enough.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.035
In fact, I'm not doing anything this
weekend, so I'll get up really early,

14:15.080 --> 14:18.356
sort my winter clothes into plastic bags
and shove them under the bed.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.515
- Can I top you up?
- No, I'm going now, Mary.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.516
- Won't you help me finish it?
- No, really.

14:23.560 --> 14:27.109
- Oh, all right. Well, I think I'm going to
stay for a little while.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.755
How's Joe?
Have you heard from him this week?

14:31.800 --> 14:34.268
- No, but I'm sure he's fine.
- Still no girlfriend?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.231
I've no idea.

14:36.280 --> 14:39.590
He must have something on the go,
a good-looking boy like him.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.119
- See you on Thursday.
- Oh!

14:41.160 --> 14:42.832
You're coming for supper on Saturday.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.553
Oh, lovely. Thank you, Gerri.
Give my love to that lovely Tom.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.477
- I will. You take care.
- Yeah.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.471
Sorry I'm late. I'm sorry.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.837
What's for supper?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.030
Arrabbiata. Are you hungry?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.311
I'm starving.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.951
Hello.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.591
Have a taste.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.437
I hope it's not too hot.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.391
You can never tell with chillies.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.751
- No.
- No?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.351
Oh, it's coming out my ears.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.755
Good. Glass of wine?

16:00.440 --> 16:03.000
No, I've had a couple.
Oh, go on, just a smidgeon.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.758
That's the spirit.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.355
- How was your day?
- Good.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.709
I was out and about, getting my hands dirty.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.035
- How about you?
- Disappointing.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.116
Pass me the parsley.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.479
No breakthroughs?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.875
I had my alcoholic tutor in again.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.239
Yeah?

16:22.280 --> 16:24.714
- He was pissed as a fart.
- Really?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.398
It was very upsetting, actually.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.072
How did you handle it?

16:30.120 --> 16:32.680
I bought him a double Scotch.
No, I had to challenge him.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.631
I told him it was up to him.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.711
How did he take that?

16:36.760 --> 16:38.716
Well, I don't know. We'll have to see.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.035
- Well, at least he came.
- Hmm.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.548
- Have we heard from Joe?
- No.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.477
But I haven't checked my e-mails.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.159
I'll ring him later. I'd love to see him.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.474
He's all right.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.911
Mr Gupta?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.678
Joe Hepple, nice to meet you.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.472
- I just came with him.
- Ah, good.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.431
Just follow me this way, please.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.199
This way.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.310
Excuse the mess.

17:19.280 --> 17:23.876
You sit there, Mr Gupta,
and... l'll pop you there.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.950
OK, now we've opened all these letters,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.834
and I've seen all I need to see
for the time being.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.314
Obviously, it's a sizeable correspondence

17:41.360 --> 17:45.558
and, understandably, Mr Gupta hasn't
exactly been in a position to open them,

17:45.600 --> 17:48.194
seeing as he's been in hospital
for the past ten weeks.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.596
But, you're looking fit and raring to go,
Mr Gupta.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.914
Huh?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.839
Excuse me.
- Hm?

17:57.880 --> 18:00.155
- How long will this take?
Not too long.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.191
It's just I have to get back to work.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.513
What do you do?

18:04.560 --> 18:07.518
Er, I'm... Restaurant family business.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.516
Oh, tasty.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.437
OK.

18:11.480 --> 18:16.395
Erm... it's important for Mr Gupta
to understand that at this point

18:16.440 --> 18:18.749
he's in no danger of being evicted.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.549
Acha?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.192
OK?

18:29.240 --> 18:31.959
I'll take you briefly through
what is going to happen in court.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.197
Erm... l'll be representing Mr Gupta
on the day.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.196
We'll put the case to the judge...

18:37.240 --> 18:38.832
...and...

18:38.880 --> 18:43.476
he will agree to adjourn which will then
give us time to sort things out, OK?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.795
So, I'll... Excuse me.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.114
Hello?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.277
- I'll get it!
All right.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.798
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, Gerri.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.956
- It's stopped raining, thank goodness.
- I know.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.638
- Welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.398
I bought you a little present, some thyme.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.476
- That's lovely. Thank you.
- It's nothing much.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.919
- Oh, there he is.
- Hello, love.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.552
Hello, Tom.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.636
Oh! I'm sorry, I just had to have a cigarette

19:31.680 --> 19:33.989
- and I know you don't like the smell.
- Don't be daft.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.395
- I'm trying to give up, aren't I, Gerri?
- Oh, are you?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.510
Only I've just had a bad experience
on the tube.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.551
- What happened?
- There was this man.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.795
- What did he do?
- Well, he was looking at me.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.469
I mean, every time I looked up,
he was looking at me.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.795
- Oh, dear.
- It was a bit unsettling, to be honest.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.319
Well, you're here now.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.352
Exactly, and I'm very happy
to be here with both of you.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.038
This is for you, Tom.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.718
- Ah!
- It's nothing special.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.954
Buenos Aires.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.675
Yeah, because I thought you went there,
didn't you, the two of you, Argentina?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.358
- No, we didn't, no.
- No.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.719
- Didn't you?
- No.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.955
Tom's been to Brazil, digging his holes.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.231
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so stupid sometimes.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.111
- That's all right.
- Oh, honestly,

20:12.160 --> 20:14.310
Pow! What are you going to do with me,
eh?

20:14.360 --> 20:18.035
I'm just going to run upstairs.
Is that all right? I won't be a minute.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.509
- I haven't seen you since Christmas.
- Really?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.869
- Oh, it's just the three of us tonight?
- Yes.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.036
- I did tell you.
- Did you?

20:32.080 --> 20:34.719
- Mm.
- We wanted you all to ourselves, Mary.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.832
Oh, thank you, Tom.
That's what all the boys say.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.438
No, I wasn't sure what to wear.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.233
I didn't know if it was going to be
one of your big dinner parties,

20:43.280 --> 20:46.670
- or just us, you know, casual.
- I think you got it just about right, Mary.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.439
- You look lovely.
- Oh, thank you, Gerri.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.916
- Oh... sorry.
- Did you have a late night?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.554
Oh! I stayed up watching the film.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.552
I couldn't wake up this morning.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.795
No, but it was lovely having a lie-in
on my day off.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.159
- We stayed in.
- Did you?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.714
- We listened to some music.
- Amongst other things.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.830
- I thought Joe might be coming.
- I don't think so.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.952
- He's coming tomorrow.
- Oh, that's a shame. I won't see him.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.070
Did Gerri tell you about me getting a car, Tom?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.075
Yes.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.714
- What do you think?
- Exciting. What are you going to get?

21:16.760 --> 21:21.038
Oh, well, I don't know.
Something small and... red.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.878
Small and red?
Well, that narrows it down.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.115
- Yeah.
- I hope you're hungry.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.879
- I'm starving, Gerri, you know me.
- We'll have to fatten you up.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.150
Oh, it's lovely having your dinner cooked
for you.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.509
You don't really bother
when you're by yourself.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.198
- You look well.
- Oh, thank you, Tom.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.753
You're nice and slim.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.711
Am I?
Well, I've always been slim, haven't I?

21:38.760 --> 21:41.672
- Unlike me. Middle-aged spread.
- Shut up.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.438
You're perfect. Gorgeous in every way.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.391
And you know it.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.832
Sit yourself down, Mary.
Help yourself to another drink.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.270
How is that dressing coming along?

21:58.320 --> 22:00.231
As well as can be expected.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.913
I hear you're going to the Emerald Isle again,
Tom.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.918
That's correct. Rent a cottage, take the car.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.838
- Put the tent in the back.
- And the sleeping bags.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.031
- If it's nice we might do a bit of camping.
- Oh, no.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.231
I wouldn't fancy sleeping in a tent,
thank you very much.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.273
No, I never had you down
as one of nature's Girl Guides, Mary.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.231
No, Tom.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.389
But I am always prepared.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.159
- Yes, but what for?
- For anything, Gerri.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.031
- You know me.
- Yes, I do.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.590
I'm not going to get a holiday this year.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.834
But then I never do, do I, Gerri?
Because I haven't got anyone to go with.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.273
It's all right for you two,
you've got each other.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.231
We're going to the Ring of Kerry.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.233
The what?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.271
- The Ring of Kerry. It's an area.
- Tralee,

23:04.320 --> 23:06.231
- Dingle Bay.
- Oh, lovely.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.077
You've been there before, haven't you?

23:08.120 --> 23:10.190
- That was Donegal.
- Oh.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.390
The geologist stands on the beach

23:12.440 --> 23:15.113
with his back to the sea
and looks at the cliffs

23:15.160 --> 23:18.436
whilst the geologist's wife stands on the beach

23:18.480 --> 23:20.994
with her back to the cliffs
looking at the sea.

23:24.720 --> 23:29.748
You see, I can't afford to buy my car
and have a holiday.

23:31.080 --> 23:36.200
But, if I had more money,
then I could do both.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.550
But when you've got your car, Mary,
you'll be able to go wherever you want,

23:39.600 --> 23:41.750
- very reasonably.
- Exactly, Tom.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.995
That's exactly why I'm getting it.

23:44.040 --> 23:49.353
You see, I like just taking off
and escaping, don't I, Gerri?

23:49.400 --> 23:50.799
Hm.

23:50.840 --> 23:54.150
I feel like I'm being somebody else.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.112
- Really? Who's that, then?
- Tom!

23:59.880 --> 24:01.791
I like to get on the train...

24:03.120 --> 24:08.114
But, you see,
the car is cheaper than the train, isn't it?

24:08.160 --> 24:09.798
Not environmentally.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.270
Oh, what you mean...?

24:15.440 --> 24:18.000
Those are my carbon footprints, Gerri.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.235
Yes, I know.

24:21.960 --> 24:26.033
Financially, cars are cheaper.
That's why there's no incentive to go by train.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.230
Well, what about the airlines?

24:28.280 --> 24:32.353
No government wants to increase
the duty on aviation fuel.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.628
No.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.114
And this government
won't invest in the railways,

24:36.160 --> 24:37.957
so anything we do is a piss in the ocean.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.115
Absolutely.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.230
And then there's the big corporations,

24:41.280 --> 24:43.953
who keep their lights on all night
in empty office blocks.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.514
We're all expected to do
our bit with eco bulbs.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.471
I know.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.711
Should I stop recycling, then, Gerri?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.830
- No.
You've got to set an example.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.713
- Yeah.
- Plant a few tomatoes.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.079
And courgettes.

25:01.680 --> 25:05.878
I am very environmentally friendly, actually.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.751
- Are you?
- Yeah.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.518
I don't fly.

25:10.280 --> 25:13.590
I don't live in a house
that's more than I need.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.158
I don't cook.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.033
- Other people cook for you, though.
- Who?

25:19.080 --> 25:20.672
You get takeaways, don't you?

25:20.720 --> 25:24.315
That doesn't count.
Everybody gets takeaways.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.511
You've built whole motorways, Tom.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.233
How environmentally friendly is that?

25:30.280 --> 25:31.395
Exactly!

25:31.440 --> 25:35.353
More cars! More cars!
At least I'm buying an old car.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.958
- Recycled.
- Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.039
Yet we're constantly told that
the measure of a thriving economy

25:41.080 --> 25:43.514
is the sale of new cars.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.152
Yes, but, Tom...

25:46.120 --> 25:48.998
...if I buy a new car...

25:50.000 --> 25:52.912
...that's another car.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.633
You're absolutely right, Mary.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.351
And would you like some coffee?

26:01.320 --> 26:02.799
No, thank you.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.956
I'd like my usual.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.198
Are you all right, Gerri?

26:19.240 --> 26:21.276
Yes, Mary, I'm fine.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.276
How are you?

26:27.480 --> 26:29.118
I'm happy.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.798
Good.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.671
I just wanted to say...

26:36.880 --> 26:40.395
...that if you ever need to share anything...

26:41.960 --> 26:43.871
...l'm here for you.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.755
I'm a very good listener.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.597
Thank you, Mary, but I'm fine.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.551
Yeah, I know.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.591
It's very kind of you, Mary.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.111
Oh, Gerri.

27:17.640 --> 27:22.316
Everybody needs someone to talk to,
don't they?

27:22.360 --> 27:24.271
Yes, Mary, they do.

27:28.680 --> 27:32.036
Oh, well, onwards and upwards.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.393
You'd better stay the night.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.158
No. No.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.952
Well, I think you should.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.831
All right, Gerri, you're the boss.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.791
We'll find you a T-shirt again.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.472
Will you?

27:50.160 --> 27:51.752
I've found you a toothbrush.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.955
I sometimes wonder what he's doing.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.873
If he thinks about me. I bet he does.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.831
How old was he?

28:02.320 --> 28:04.629
He'll be 64 now.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.114
64?
Blimey, he's older than me.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.515
- Almost a pensioner.
He'll be past it now, Mary.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.437
- Give us your hand.
- Oh, no, Tom.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.993
He was lovely.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.190
Well, we all grow old.

28:15.240 --> 28:19.916
Oh, no, but he was very, very, sexy, Gerri.
Do you know what I mean?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.030
Too much information.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.991
I bet he regrets it deep down.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.878
I hope he does.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.191
He was my big love...

28:31.640 --> 28:33.358
...but he was married.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.355
Well, what can you do, Tom?

28:38.400 --> 28:40.834
You can't walk around
with a label saying,

28:41.800 --> 28:45.110
"Don't fall in love with me,
I'm married," can you?

28:45.160 --> 28:46.798
Some people wear a ring.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.478
He didn't.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.353
But he wasn't a bad person.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.038
He loved me.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.077
Sounds to me
like he was a duplicitous shit.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.599
Tom?

29:10.880 --> 29:12.632
Do you think it was my fault, Tom?

29:12.680 --> 29:14.432
No, I don't, Mary.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.753
Honest.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.075
It takes two to tango.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.793
Oh, so you think it was my fault, Gerri?

29:21.840 --> 29:24.638
- I didn't say that.
- No, I know you didn't, really.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.589
I blame my big heart.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.870
Well, we all have to make choices,
don't we?

29:35.400 --> 29:38.278
Why do I always get it wrong, Gerri?

29:42.440 --> 29:45.796
I mean, look what happened
when I got divorced from that shit.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.994
I let him palm me off with 5,000...
nothing pounds

29:52.040 --> 29:53.792
and what am I left with now?

29:53.840 --> 29:55.398
Sod all.

29:56.560 --> 30:03.033
I'm living in a poky rented flat when
I should have my own home at my age.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.472
It's not fair.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.393
Bastard.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.037
My goodness.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.638
Hm?

30:46.680 --> 30:49.513
- She gets worse.
- I know. Desperate.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.751
I feel a bit guilty.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.432
What?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.072
Well, you know.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.031
No.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.388
No. You're right.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.755
I don't think I really
enjoyed history at school.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.677
Didn't you?

31:15.720 --> 31:17.358
Maybe I did.

31:20.520 --> 31:23.557
It's just that the older you get,
the more relevant it seems.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.238
Hm.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.191
To state the bleeding obvious.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.311
We'll be part of history soon.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.839
Exactly.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.479
- Aha!
- Aha!

31:44.520 --> 31:46.988
What are you doing riding
on the pavement, young man?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.632
I'm breaking the law, officer.

31:48.680 --> 31:49.795
- 'Ey up.
- Hiya.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.512
- How long did it take?
- About an hour.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.278
- Are you knackered?
- I'm ready for bed.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.117
- Late night?
- Hangover.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.832
- Do you want a hand?
- Yes, please.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.791
- I'll stick this away.
- All right.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.678
Oh, he's back. That was quick, Tom.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.631
- Didn't you get the manure?
Compost.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.830
- Here's Joe!
- Hi, Mary.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.472
Hello, Joe, what a surprise.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.556
- Are you all right?
- I'm great. How are you?

32:10.600 --> 32:13.592
- Oh, continental! He's all sweaty.
- I've been riding all morning.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.153
Have you? I like your hat.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.428
- Aha!
- Aha!

32:16.480 --> 32:18.914
Ah, that's right.
Never forget to kiss your mum.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.520
- I never do.
- No, you're a good boy, aren't you?

32:21.560 --> 32:23.676
- Yeah.
- I remember when you were this big.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.278
You were a naughty boy.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.231
- I still am from time to time.
- Oh, really?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.430
- I like your coat.
- Oh, thank you.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.472
I think I'm a bit overdressed for
a Sunday morning. What do you think?

32:32.520 --> 32:35.671
- Is that what you wore in bed?
- I slept in your bed. Is that all right?

32:35.720 --> 32:38.632
- As long as you cleaned the sheets.
- No, I didn't. Is that a problem?

32:38.680 --> 32:40.477
- We'll have to wait and see.
- Oh, right.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.431
Oh, sorry, Tom. I'm in your way.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.595
All of these strong men.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.393
- Look at his muscles.
- That's why we had him.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.033
All right, well, I'm off, then.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.196
- You want a lift to the station?
- It's all right.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.470
- Are you sure?
- I'll be fine. I could do with a walk.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.192
Yeah.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.913
- Sorry about... you know...
- It's OK.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.076
It was good to see you.
- Oh, thank you, Tom.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.678
Are you all right?

33:04.720 --> 33:06.358
Yeah, you know.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.311
Had a bit of a wild night, Joe.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.358
Well, I'd best be off.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.433
Oh, thanks for saving me that breakfast.
It was really delicious.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.516
- You're very welcome, Mary.
- Yeah.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.915
It's lovely to see you, Joe.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.871
See you soon.
- Yeah, hopefully.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.876
Well, have a lovely day together, all of you.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.275
- Right. Ta-ta, then.
- Yeah, OK. Bye.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.515
- See you on Tuesday, Gerri.
- Bye, Mary. Take care.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.709
Bye.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.557
- Bye Joe.
Bye.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.511
- Bye.
- Bye.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.229
There you go.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.589
- Delicious.
- Present for you.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.792
Matt's getting married.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.068
Oh, Mathew!

34:18.120 --> 34:19.632
Oh, is he? Matt with the guitar?

34:19.679 --> 34:21.079
No, that's Paul.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.156
Oh, Matt, yeah.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.474
That's great.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.750
- Have you met the lady in question?
- Certainly have.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.473
- Is she worthy of him?
- No, they hate each other.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.556
You mean, is he worthy of her?

34:32.600 --> 34:34.397
Oh, beg your pardon, Mrs Pankhurst.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.717
Where's the stag do this time?
Buenos Aires?

34:38.760 --> 34:40.637
- No, Dublin.
- Ooh, lovely.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.513
Another capital city brought to its knees.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.437
Well, we'll try and leave it as we find it.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.835
- When are you going?
- July. The wedding's August.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.155
Lovely. I'll make some tea.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.390
So, when's it going to be your turn?

34:59.440 --> 35:00.953
A week on Wednesday?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.798
- Oh, you didn't say.
I didn't want to spoil the surprise.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.479
- I knew.
- Oh, no, I haven't bought a hat.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.433
Any news?

35:16.040 --> 35:17.678
Nobody...?

35:17.720 --> 35:19.870
No, still quiet on that front.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.113
What?

35:51.960 --> 35:53.871
Sorry, love. Excuse me.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.036
Who's that a-knocking on my door?

36:21.080 --> 36:22.399
It's only me!

36:22.440 --> 36:24.192
- Bugger off!
- Hello, Tom, mate.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.549
Hiya, Gerri, love.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.194
- Hi, Ken, how are you?
- I'm all right.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.992
- Oh, crushed ribs.
- Sorry.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.917
- Give us your bag.
- I'm bursting for a pee.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.951
I'll just run upstairs. Is that all right?

36:36.120 --> 36:38.793
I'll put it on your bed.
You're in Joe's room.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.679
- Ooh, that's better. I needed that.
- I'll take your coat.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.278
Thanks, mate.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.914
- Ooh, Gerri.
- Careful, Ken.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.030
- Would you like a beer?
- Oh, I'd love one, ta.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.071
Hup! Ha, ha, ha!

37:01.280 --> 37:03.350
- Maniacs.
- Oh...

37:04.280 --> 37:05.395
Mm.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.473
Mm.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.914
- It's great this.
- Thank you.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.109
Mm!

37:16.080 --> 37:17.354
Better?

37:17.400 --> 37:19.038
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.752
- Haven't you?
- No.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.119
It's great to see you both. Cheers.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.559
Cheers.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.919
Cheers.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.835
- Mm.
- So how's your flat, Ken?

37:32.880 --> 37:35.440
Oh, same old, same old.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.754
You employed a cleaner yet?

37:36.800 --> 37:39.712
If I got a cleaner in, she'd turn round,
walk straight out again.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.512
It might give her a purpose in life.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.471
- Bit of a mess, but it suits me.
- Yeah.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.158
Five minutes walk to work.

37:45.200 --> 37:49.113
I usually get the bus, but if I'm late,
I have to leg it, if I miss the bus.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.310
I stop at the caff to pick up breakfast.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.635
I have a croissant
if they haven't got any iced buns.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.318
Cup of tea.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.998
I have to smuggle it in.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.395
Just because of that Steve.
He's a right fascist.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.556
That's your boss, isn't it?
- Yeah, my boss.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.113
My supervisor.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.116
- Is he still there?
Oh, yeah.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.355
He's only been with us three...
no, two years.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.995
35, looks 12, treats me like a child.
Bloody graduate.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.713
- You're a graduate.
- We're all graduates, aren't we?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.228
- Oh, yeah, so we are!
- You forgot.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.952
Would you like some salad, Ken?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.116
- No, no. I'm all right, ta.
- Sure?

38:22.040 --> 38:26.556
I mean, you spend nearly 40 years trying to get
people out of the dole queue and into jobs.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.352
What thanks do you get? I'm sick of it!

38:28.400 --> 38:30.231
At your age, you can walk away, can't you?

38:30.280 --> 38:32.077
Hm. I don't know.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.396
You've got a good retirement package.
Index linked pension.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.635
- I could have gone two years ago.
- Why didn't you?

38:37.680 --> 38:39.910
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Isn't it?

38:39.960 --> 38:42.394
What would you do with your time
if you retired, Ken?

38:44.080 --> 38:45.399
Pub.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.192
Eat, drink, be merry.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.839
I don't know.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.799
How's Joe?

38:55.840 --> 38:58.149
- He's fine. You'll see him on Sunday.
He's well.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.475
Oh, great. Has he got a girlfriend?

39:00.520 --> 39:03.478
No, I don't think so.
Not that we know of.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.158
Who else is coming to the barbeque?

39:05.200 --> 39:06.553
Jack and Janey.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.352
Tanya, GP from work.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.914
- Mary.
- Oh, Mary.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.393
Is she?

39:13.200 --> 39:16.078
Then, of course, there's yourself, sir.
The guest of honour.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.348
Hooray!

39:17.400 --> 39:19.038
I don't know about that.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.318
What else you been up to?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.918
Oh, nothing much.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.956
Mm! Oh, no, hey.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.877
Guess where I went the other week.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.672
- Where?
- Hull versus Derby.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.439
- Ho, ho, ho! Who'd you cheer for?
- Derby, of course.

39:33.480 --> 39:36.074
I had to keep quiet,
I got stuck with the home mob.

39:36.120 --> 39:39.271
- Was there owt worth cheering?
- No, it were crap.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.675
I don't think my brother
ever missed one home game.

39:41.720 --> 39:45.349
No. Me and my dad used to stand
with him on the terraces.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.392
You used to leave Carl at your mum's
on a Saturday afternoon. Remember?

39:48.440 --> 39:49.998
Oh, yeah.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.474
You could hear the roar of the crowd
from the front room.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.590
Of course you could.
It was three streets away.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.073
Our house used to shake.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.395
Ours did. They all did.

39:58.440 --> 40:02.797
During the Clough glory years, we were
at the centre of the footballing universe.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.717
- You never went.
- I did occasionally.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.273
I wasn't manic, like him.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.631
I don't think Ronnie can afford to go now,
the price of season tickets.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.955
How is Ronnie?
I haven't seen him for years.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.956
- He's 70 now, you know.
Is he?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.718
- Carl's 41.
Bloody hell.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.752
- Linda's still working.
- She's kept him all his life.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.916
- She's worn out, poor woman.
Is Carl the same?

40:23.960 --> 40:25.632
As far as we know.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.318
Very sad.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.952
Linda's heartbroken.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.434
So's Ronnie.
- He's cut himself off.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.993
I used to have a drink with Ronnie.

40:33.040 --> 40:36.077
When my dad was in the home, I'd
go to Derby, he was always in the pub.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.111
Yep, that's one of the advantages

40:38.160 --> 40:41.152
of being free from the tyranny
of regular employment.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.395
- He never bought a round.
- Are you accusing my brother

40:43.440 --> 40:45.510
- of being a mean bastard?
- Yeah, I am.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.357
- You're right, he is.
- I know.

40:48.440 --> 40:49.873
Mm.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.796
I mean, I...

41:06.040 --> 41:10.192
You get to a certain age...
I can't go to the places I used to.

41:10.240 --> 41:11.958
They don't like old fogies.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.991
- You don't have to go.
They're my pubs.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.359
Not any more, they're not.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.073
Except they're not like pubs now,
they're all poncy bars.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.236
Exactly, things change.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.431
When I started at work,
we'd all socialise together.

41:23.480 --> 41:27.598
On a Friday night, everybody would go
to the pub for a drink, go for a curry.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.039
But now...

41:29.080 --> 41:30.672
It's hard, isn't it?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.791
I mean, who would I go on holiday with?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.917
There's nobody, let's face it.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.789
The only time I went on holiday
was with Pam.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.794
Spain. Nightmare.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.319
Didn't you go away with Andrea?

41:50.360 --> 41:52.669
No, she went off with her sister.
You remember?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.039
Oh, yeah.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.672
Stood me up, the bitch.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.069
It leaves a nasty taste, doesn't it?

42:00.560 --> 42:02.869
Girls in bikinis covered with suntan oil.

42:03.840 --> 42:07.037
Boys flexing their muscles on the beach.
No, it's not for me.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.433
Oh, I don't know.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.277
Sounds nice.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.630
You could try a cultural holiday.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.035
No, I'm not one for culture.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.672
Pub culture.

42:18.680 --> 42:22.434
Young people, young people.
Everything's for young people.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.238
These bars, you know, they're full of
young people shouting about nothing.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.874
I seem to remember you got banned
from a number of pubs in Hull

42:29.920 --> 42:31.672
for shouting about nothing,

42:31.720 --> 42:33.472
when you were a young person.

42:34.520 --> 42:35.714
Right.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.357
"Ken, we like you.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.516
You're a good bloke,
you're good on the darts,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.949
but if you talk about politics again,
you're barred."

42:52.480 --> 42:55.677
No, but these kids,
they're just bloody noisy.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.880
Isle of Wight Festival, 1968.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.990
We were noisy, weren't we?

43:01.040 --> 43:03.156
- We weren't, he was.
- You were noisy.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.634
- You were noisy.
- I know I was noisy.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.358
Remember Plastic Penny?

43:08.400 --> 43:10.516
Plastic Penny.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.199
- Where are they now?
- You fancied Plastic Penny.

43:17.840 --> 43:21.037
It's the young person's prerogative
to be noisy.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.150
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's all my own fault.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.909
I'm not meeting the right people.
I'm stuck in a rut.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.234
It's not your fault, Ken.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.238
You are stuck in a rut.
That's why you can't face retirement.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.952
Yeah, I know.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.873
I'm dreading getting on that train
Sunday night. I always do.

43:37.920 --> 43:40.639
- Why?
- I know what I'll be thinking.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.830
There's nothing for me in Hull any more.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.398
Except my job.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.391
Most of my friends have gone.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.874
Hit you hard when Gordon died, didn't it?

43:51.920 --> 43:53.114
And his wife.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.832
Is she gone?

43:54.880 --> 43:55.949
Yes.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.672
Oh, yeah, they're both gone now.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.274
Funnily enough, I was thinking about him
on the way down.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.789
I looked out the windows
when we were in Lincolnshire,

44:06.800 --> 44:08.518
I saw this fucking tree.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.513
It rem...

44:20.400 --> 44:22.755
It reminded me of his funeral.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.718
Oh, Ken.

44:30.600 --> 44:31.999
Ken.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.312
Ken.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.872
Come on.

44:36.920 --> 44:39.195
Gerri, I'm sorry.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.037
It's all right.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.632
I'm sorry, Tom.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.718
How you doing?

45:07.040 --> 45:09.235
- I feel like shit.
- You look like shit.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.998
I know.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.679
- Apart from that, how are you doing?
- I still feel like shit.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.518
I'll race you to the top.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.755
- What?
- Snake Pass, I'll race you.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.233
Oh, yeah.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.357
When was the last time you sat on a bike?

45:25.400 --> 45:27.789
1896, penny-farthing.

45:32.200 --> 45:34.350
I tell you what.

45:34.400 --> 45:38.871
You and me, we'll walk from Edale
to Matlock Bath.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.232
Take as long as it takes.

45:42.280 --> 45:45.192
Stay in nice pubs along the way.
What do you reckon?

45:45.240 --> 45:46.719
I'll tell you what.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.512
I'll stay in the pubs, you do the walking.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.357
Bugger that, you're carrying the bags.

45:54.440 --> 45:55.998
How about it?

45:59.560 --> 46:01.357
Serious, we'll go in the autumn.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.516
What are we going to do with you, then,
eh?

46:18.800 --> 46:20.950
You can't go on like this, that's for sure.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.269
So, is it every man for himself
or are we having teams?

47:19.320 --> 47:20.435
Teams.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.439
If I might make so bold, I would suggest
that the best plays with the worst, Jack.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.630
- Good idea.
- In other words, you're with Ken.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.318
- Thanks.
- It's me and you, Ken.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.191
- Is there anything on it?
- Bottle of wine.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.434
You're on.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.232
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, go on.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.838
- It's you!
- Ah, right!

47:34.880 --> 47:36.711
- Shall I kick off?
- You take the honour.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.671
So, this father and son team.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.871
- The double Hepple.
- Yes, take on these unknown mavericks.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.478
- That's us, Ken.
- Good luck, Tom.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.192
And good luck to you, Mo.

47:45.240 --> 47:51.349
Can I just say what a great pleasure it is
to be playing with you once again?

47:51.400 --> 47:53.072
Yep, yeah. Watch and learn, Ken.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.712
There's wine on it.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.318
Right.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.913
Off we go.

48:07.160 --> 48:08.832
- At-choo!
- I knew it!

48:08.880 --> 48:11.075
- I knew you were going to do that!
- Ha, ha, ha!

48:11.120 --> 48:13.918
All my life I've had to put up
with this nonsense from you

48:13.960 --> 48:16.793
and I'm not going to have it any longer!

48:21.200 --> 48:23.191
Don't scare the wildlife, Ken.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.276
How many times a night do you go?

48:25.320 --> 48:27.231
I lose count.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.396
You gotta get it sorted out, Ken.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.759
Yeah.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.310
- Oh, what a beauty.
- Lovely.

48:35.360 --> 48:36.793
Good shot, partner?

48:36.840 --> 48:38.717
- Oh, sorry. Good shot, Jack.
- Thank you.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.398
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.397
- You want it out, Joe?
- Yep.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.992
Good luck, partner.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.712
It's all down to this.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.311
Looks good.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.157
Oh!

49:02.200 --> 49:04.430
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

49:04.480 --> 49:05.993
My partner.
Oh, yes.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.879
Gerri!

49:42.920 --> 49:44.433
- Tom!
- Here she is.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.471
- Hello, Mary.
- Sorry I'm so late.

49:46.520 --> 49:49.159
- What happened?
- It's taken me three hours to get here.

49:49.200 --> 49:52.636
I left home at two. I had to ask
a policeman in the end, I got so lost.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.910
- You got lost?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.757
- You've been here loads of times.
- I know.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.155
- You know the way.
- Yeah, but I came in my car, Gerri.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.599
- Oh, God!
- What's happened?

50:00.640 --> 50:03.359
Oh, I'm so stupid.
Why do I always spoil everything?

50:03.400 --> 50:05.789
- I wanted it to be a surprise.
- You've bought a car?

50:05.840 --> 50:07.319
- Yeah!
- God help us.

50:07.360 --> 50:09.715
I got it ever so cheap.
I was really chuffed with myself

50:09.760 --> 50:13.958
because they wanted 700,
but I offered 600, but we settled at 650.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.673
They were a nice couple of guys.
I think they were brothers.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.472
- One of them had a gold tooth.
- Did he?

50:18.520 --> 50:20.272
Yeah. But, they wanted cash.

50:20.320 --> 50:24.438
So I had to go to the cash point on
Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.835
So, I couldn't collect it
till after work on Friday.

50:26.880 --> 50:28.552
But they rang on Friday morning

50:28.600 --> 50:30.989
to find out what time I was going
to go round with the money.

50:31.040 --> 50:34.350
And had I sorted out the insurance?
Well, that hadn't even crossed my mind!

50:34.400 --> 50:37.710
So, I spent the whole of my lunch break
on Friday sorting that out

50:37.760 --> 50:41.230
and it was really expensive
because I haven't driven since 1984.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.716
But I didn't tell you on Thursday, Gerri,
because I knew I was coming here today

50:44.760 --> 50:46.318
and I wanted to surprise you all.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.271
It is a surprise.
Shall I take that from you?

50:48.320 --> 50:49.912
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.
- Thank you.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.632
Oh, Tom, sorry.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.471
- Can I have a little glass, please?
- Sure?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.238
You shouldn't drive if you're drinking.

50:56.280 --> 50:59.431
I know, Gerri, but you're allowed
a couple of glasses, aren't you, Tanya?

50:59.480 --> 51:01.630
- Small ones.
- Yeah, yeah. Is that all right, Tom?

51:01.680 --> 51:03.193
Yeah.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.752
- Hi, Gerri.
- Hi.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.518
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, don't be daft.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.232
- Hi, Tanya.
- Hello.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.396
Oh, we really miss you at work,
don't we, Gerri?

51:11.440 --> 51:14.034
- Sweetheart.
- When are you back off maternity leave?

51:14.080 --> 51:15.752
- Give us a chance.
- Oh, yeah.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.313
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.828
- Oh, it's really lovely to see you.
- You too.

51:19.880 --> 51:22.678
- Hi, Ken. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.915
- Come and sit down, Mary.
- Have a seat, Mary.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.837
- Is anyone sitting here?
- No.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.633
- No.
- Oh, this is lovely. Hiya, Jack.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.636
I thought you were going to miss me out, Mary.

51:31.680 --> 51:34.274
Oh, sorry. Where's Janey?

51:34.320 --> 51:36.356
She's a bit under the weather
this afternoon.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.516
Oh, sorry to hear that. Oh, I'm starving.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.357
Oh, the baby!

51:40.400 --> 51:42.675
- Oh, yeah, the baby.
- I'm sorry, Tanya.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.756
- That's all right.
- Oh, hello, little Isaac.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.836
Say hello. Don't mind the funny lady.

51:46.880 --> 51:48.632
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognise him.

51:48.680 --> 51:50.318
Oh, he's asleep.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.157
Oh, hasn't he grown?
He's got ever so big.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.872
- They do that.
- Here you are.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.309
- Oh, thanks, Tom.
- I'll give him to you.

51:57.840 --> 52:00.559
- Where do you want him?
- Oh, that's better.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.837
Are you OK?

52:02.880 --> 52:04.359
We've saved you some food, Mary.

52:04.400 --> 52:07.073
- I hope it's still warm.
- Oh, thanks, Gerri. That will be fine.

52:07.120 --> 52:10.078
- I'll do you some fresh, if you like.
- Oh, no, don't worry about me.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.475
- So you didn't get arrested, Mary?
- No, I didn't, Joe.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.112
He was very kind to me, actually.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.832
What CC is your car?

52:17.800 --> 52:19.950
- What do you mean?
- How big's the engine?

52:20.000 --> 52:21.672
Oh, I don't know.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.317
It's about this big, I think.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.270
- What's so funny?
- Don't be cruel.

52:31.320 --> 52:34.198
He means, how powerful is it, Mary?
How many cubic centimetres?

52:34.240 --> 52:35.753
- Oh.
- You should know that.

52:35.800 --> 52:38.030
On the back there's numbers,
like 1.6 or 1.9.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.992
Oh, yeah, I know, yeah.
Well, that's boys' stuff, isn't it?

52:41.040 --> 52:43.190
- It's not important.
- No, Tanya.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.634
I think I'm gonna have a cigarette
before I eat this.

52:46.680 --> 52:49.114
- I'll get out your way.
- Shall we take Isaac over there?

52:49.160 --> 52:52.197
Oh, well, I thought you wouldn't mind
cos we're outside.

52:52.240 --> 52:54.356
- We don't, Mary. You carry on.
- You're all right.

52:54.400 --> 52:56.834
- You're all right.
It's OK. I fancy a swing.

52:58.560 --> 53:02.109
- Have one of these, Mary.
- It's all right. I've got my own, thank you.

53:02.160 --> 53:04.071
- Here.
- Oh...

53:05.880 --> 53:07.279
Thanks.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.030
I'll have a smoke with you.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.190
Well, I don't really smoke, normally.

53:15.240 --> 53:17.549
I just have the occasional one or two.

53:24.440 --> 53:26.078
How are you doing?

53:27.400 --> 53:29.630
Yeah, I'm really well, thanks, Ken.

53:31.440 --> 53:32.953
Still on your own, are you?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.275
Yeah, I am and I like it like that, you know.

53:35.320 --> 53:37.117
You're like me.

53:46.480 --> 53:48.152
He's good.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.918
He's great.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.871
- He's a hungry bugger.
- Is he?

53:51.920 --> 53:53.433
Just like his dad.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.038
Is he a good dad?

53:55.080 --> 53:55.990
Yeah.

53:56.040 --> 53:57.712
Is he a nappy changer?

53:57.760 --> 53:58.988
Ish.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.951
I expect you're too capable.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.871
- Oh, I am.
- Like Gerri was.

54:04.680 --> 54:06.238
Like Gerri was what?

54:06.280 --> 54:09.511
- Mind your own business.
- We're talking about you, not to you.

54:10.600 --> 54:13.751
Hey, thanks for popping round on Friday.
Janey really appreciated it.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.199
- How is she?
- Not good.

54:15.240 --> 54:16.195
No.

54:16.240 --> 54:20.119
It's exhausting all the time, just getting up
and down the stairs, knocks her out.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.479
I noticed.

54:22.440 --> 54:26.274
She could do with losing a few pounds,
but she's not getting any exercise, so...

54:26.320 --> 54:28.231
- How are you doing?
- Oh, I'm all right.

54:28.280 --> 54:31.192
We stay cheerful, you know?
We don't let things get us down.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.559
That's the spirit.

54:38.960 --> 54:42.191
No, it's all right, Ken. I can pour my
own wine, thank you very much.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.195
Sorry.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.117
Look at the food in this fridge.

54:45.160 --> 54:46.991
I haven't got anything in mine.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.758
I'll see you later, all right?

54:51.160 --> 54:52.479
Here she comes.

54:52.520 --> 54:54.715
- Can I come in the middle?
- Of course you can.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.716
Never come between a mother and her son.

54:58.280 --> 55:00.032
Oh, this is my second one, Gerri.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.196
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, and then that's it.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.196
This could be the making of you, Mary.

55:04.240 --> 55:05.229
Yeah.

55:05.280 --> 55:06.793
I think so, Gerri.

55:06.840 --> 55:10.435
I mean, just driving here today,
I felt like a whole person.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.391
- Did you?
- Yeah, a free spirit.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.637
I mean, even though the journey
was a complete nightmare,

55:15.680 --> 55:19.673
from beginning to end - it was awful,
people were getting so cross with me.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.597
It's a lovely little car.

55:21.640 --> 55:23.676
I want you to come out and see it later.

55:23.720 --> 55:27.235
I feel really good behind the wheel,
really special.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.477
- You looked so lovely holding that baby.
- He's delightful.

55:30.520 --> 55:33.512
I expect you're looking forward
to being a grandmother.

55:33.560 --> 55:35.278
Hm, you should ask my son about that.

55:35.320 --> 55:37.038
It's got nothing to do with me.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.638
He's great, isn't he?

55:38.680 --> 55:41.956
You should come out and have a drink
with us sometime, me and your mum.

55:42.000 --> 55:42.671
Yeah?

55:42.720 --> 55:45.473
- Yeah, why not? We often go, don't we?
- Occasionally, yes.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.478
- Yeah, I know you do.
- It doesn't even have to be your mum.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.476
- It could be just us.
- Just you and me?

55:50.520 --> 55:54.195
Yeah, well, we've known each other a while,
haven't we? We're old friends.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.878
Could you get me a refill, Joe?

55:56.920 --> 55:58.911
- Yes, Mummy.
- Thank you.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.271
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.754
- Can I get you a drink?
- Got one somewhere.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.431
Oh, here comes Ken.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.271
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.911
- He's a good lad.
- Yes.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.840
He could be quite good-looking,
if he wanted to.

56:24.880 --> 56:26.313
How's it going?

56:26.360 --> 56:27.873
He's got a nice clean bum.

56:27.920 --> 56:30.434
He should lose a couple of
stone, shouldn't he?

56:31.400 --> 56:33.470
He was a good-looking man
when he was young.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.953
- Was he?
- Mm.

56:36.400 --> 56:38.072
He's got a good heart.

56:40.560 --> 56:42.278
Life's not always kind, is it?

56:43.240 --> 56:44.798
No, it isn't, Gerri.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.191
I don't mind the grey hair.

57:00.880 --> 57:04.350
I think that can look quite distinguished
on a man of his age, but...

57:06.920 --> 57:08.239
You know.

57:21.880 --> 57:25.031
- I'll give you a ring in the week.
- We'll have a proper game next time.

57:25.080 --> 57:26.798
- Ta-ta.
- See you.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.033
Hi, Joe.

57:35.080 --> 57:36.308
Hi.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.271
- Have you come back to me?
- I have.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.550
- They all come back in the end.
- Do they?

57:40.600 --> 57:43.319
- In my nightmares.
- Oh, it's as bad as that, is it?

57:43.360 --> 57:45.430
Oh, let's not open that can of worms.

57:45.480 --> 57:48.278
- No, let's leave that closed.
- Not today, anyway.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.031
Oh, how are you, Joe?

57:52.200 --> 57:55.033
- Is life treating you kind?
- Can't complain.

57:55.760 --> 57:57.716
- Really?
- Yes.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.671
Nothing you want to share with me?

58:00.680 --> 58:02.113
No, I don't think so.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.833
Because you know that you can talk to me.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.791
Any time you like.

58:07.600 --> 58:09.431
Well, I'll come and find you if I need you.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.913
Yeah. Yeah.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.949
I like to feel that I'm always there for you.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.553
Thanks, Mary.

58:16.600 --> 58:18.033
How are you?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.433
Yeah, I'm all right.

58:22.480 --> 58:23.993
No, I'm great, actually.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.951
- Well, you look well.
- Do I?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.319
Oh, thank you.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.713
I suddenly feel...

58:29.760 --> 58:31.159
really liberated.

58:31.200 --> 58:33.589
- Well, you're a free spirit now.
- I know.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.949
You're your own woman.
The world's your oyster.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.558
It's so exciting, isn't it?

58:38.600 --> 58:40.192
I feel like Thelma and Louise.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.752
This little car is going to change my life.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.279
Well, let's hope so.

58:47.280 --> 58:50.033
I do feel a bit guilty, though,
but at the end of the day...

58:51.000 --> 58:52.399
...so what?

58:52.440 --> 58:54.158
It's my little present to me.

58:54.200 --> 58:55.713
- That's fair enough.
- Yeah.

58:56.680 --> 59:00.275
Because if I don't treat myself,
nobody else is going to, are they?

59:00.320 --> 59:02.038
What are you going to call this car?

59:03.080 --> 59:05.719
Ooh, I don't know.
Why? Do you give names to things?

59:05.760 --> 59:08.035
- I've got names for everything.
- Really?

59:08.080 --> 59:10.594
- Like what?
- Well, my nose is called Roger.

59:10.640 --> 59:12.358
Oh, you mean...

59:12.400 --> 59:13.913
...your body parts!

59:13.960 --> 59:17.032
Yeah, I'm not going to introduce you
to everyone though.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.396
What, not even little Percy?

59:20.440 --> 59:21.953
You've already met my knee, then?

59:23.840 --> 59:26.149
Oh, Joe, we must go out
and have a drink one night.

59:26.200 --> 59:28.111
- We have such a laugh.
- Yeah, we do.

59:28.160 --> 59:31.709
You see, the thing about you and me is
that we've always just sort of clicked.

59:31.760 --> 59:33.352
- Haven't we?
- Yeah.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.150
Yeah.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.076
It's nice when that happens, isn't it?

59:44.440 --> 59:46.715
Do you remember
when you showed me your little box?

59:46.760 --> 59:47.715
Yes.

59:48.520 --> 59:50.238
You wouldn't tell me what was in it.

59:50.280 --> 59:51.838
I'm still not going to tell you.

59:51.880 --> 59:53.029
I know.

59:53.080 --> 59:54.035
What?

59:55.440 --> 59:57.112
I'm not telling you.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.958
I still think about that.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.911
We had a barbeque that day, didn't we?

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.957
Oh! It still smells the same.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.558
It's messy, isn't it?

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.273
Your kids will enjoy playing
in here, won't they?

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.993
One day.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.152
So, is there anyone special in your life
at the moment, Joe?

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.395
- No.
- Oh, good.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.432
No, what I mean is, that's all right.
You're comfortable with that.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.754
- Aren't you?
- Am I?

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.349
Well, the thing is, Joe, you're young.
You still want to be out there, don't you?

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.799
What, sowing my wild oats?

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.159
Well, yeah.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.397
Live life while you can.
Don't think about tomorrow.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.795
Well, a lot of my friends
are getting married.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.957
Oh, but, yeah,
you wanna be careful, Joe, because...

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.198
See, I got married in my 20s
and, granted he was the wrong man,

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.958
but I was too young.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.638
I couldn't handle it.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.037
But when I was in my 30s,
I met the right man and I was mature.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.638
I was ready for it.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.311
I mean, he left me, but...

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.353
What can you do?

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.911
It's never too late, Mary.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.551
Oh, no, I know it isn't, Joe,

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.910
and, you know me, I'm very much
a glass-half-full kind of girl.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.513
But it's tricky, because...

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.872
I meet these older men,
who want somebody younger,

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.115
and that's great, because I fit the bill.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.514
But...

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.471
when they find out that...

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.274
...you know, I'm not as young
as they thought...

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.390
they don't want to know.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.791
My looks work against me.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.951
How old do you think I look, Joe?

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.515
60?

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.869
70?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.478
Oh, stop it.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.268
Oh, it's all right.
You don't have to answer that.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.436
So, when are we going to have this drink?

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.596
I don't know. I'll have to check my diary.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.517
- Yeah. You do that. Give me a call.
- I will.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.471
- Promise.
- I promise.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.108
Mate, got to get your train. We should get
cracking. I'll run you to the station.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.718
You've had too much to drink, Tom.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.398
- No, I haven't.
- I think you have.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.476
- I'm all right.
- We can get him a mini cab.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.432
- No, I'll be fine on the tube.
- You don't want to get a mini cab.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.119
It might take 20 minutes to turn up.
We haven't got time.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.390
I had a really bad experience
in a mini cab once.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.829
- You're going on the tube, aren't you?
- Of course.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.997
Don't go on the tube, Joe. I can give
you a lift. You can be my navigator.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.473
- Ooh, that sounds fun.
- Yeah.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.988
You can give them both a lift.
All in the same direction.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.112
- I'm not sure Mary can manage that.
- Of course I can. Oh, I don't know.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.549
- I'll be fine on the tube, honest.
- It's a great idea.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.672
- I don't know how to get to King's Cross.
- I do. We can all go together.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.598
- Great. Is that all right with you, Mary?
- Yeah, of course it is.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.198
It'll be good practice for me.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.629
I'm going to run upstairs
before we go on the journey.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.238
I'm not sure about this.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.679
It'll be fine.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.233
Better pack my bag.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.713
- Tom.
- What?

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.393
What do you think, Tom?

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.715
Well, it's small and red.
It's what you asked for.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.228
What have you done, Mary?
- It's great, isn't it?

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.793
- Nice bit of parking, Mary.
- Oh.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.753
Oh, God, I didn't lock it.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.155
It's a good job it didn't get
pinched, isn't it?

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.832
By the way, Mary, it's a 1.4.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.835
Oh.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.314
You must come again.
Now you don't know the way.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.753
Oi, where are you going?

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.072
Oh, God, Joe.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.429
- What am I going to do without you?
- You'll be fine.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.630
Can't you stay just till
we get to King's Cross?

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.116
- We'll be all right, Mary.
- Ken! You don't even know London.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.593
It'll be signposted.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.110
It's so lovely having you next to me, Joe,
telling me where to go and what to do.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.593
It's been a pleasure, Mary.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.518
Oh, please, I'll take you anywhere you want.
I'll take you home.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.993
Just here will do.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.837
Oh, God. All right. Let me pull in.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.030
Oh, bye, then. But lovely to see you.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.116
- Don't forget to give me a ring.
- No, I won't.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.479
- Bye, Joe.
- Yeah, take care.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.272
- See you soon.
- Look after yourself.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.197
- Oh, Joe, where do I go?
- Straight ahead.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.231
- Left round the one-way system.
- Yeah. OK.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.793
- Bye, then. Bye.
- Yeah.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.671
- I'll get in the front now.
- Oh, no, Ken.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.233
We haven't got time for this.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.833
Oh, for God's sake.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.431
Oh! No need to slam the door.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.717
- You better hurry up.
- Yeah, I'll run.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.432
Yeah, I'll see you soon, then.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.993
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Bye.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.234
Bye, Ken.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.078
- I like you, Mary. Can I phone you?
- No, Ken. No.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.271
- I could come down and see you.
- Take your hand off of me, please, Ken!

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.230
Sorry.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.998
I'm going to have to be honest with you.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.271
I just don't have those kind of feelings
for you, Ken. I'm really sorry.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.275
Right.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:19.990
Oh!

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.996
Sorry, I got carried away.
I didn't mean to.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.554
It's all right. Hurry up.
Your train is going in a minute.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.591
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, all right. Bye.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.873
God Almighty!

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.388
- I'll put the kettle on.
- The sooner the better.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.479
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.875
What are you doing here, you daft bugger?

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.433
I've come to surprise you.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.435
Joe!

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.153
- You certainly did that.
- It's lovely to see you.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.110
Ohh!

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.149
Hello!

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.111
Sorry. He made me hide behind the door.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.754
- You frightened the life out of me.
- So, who's this, then?

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.438
- Mum, Dad, this is Katie.
- Hello.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.631
- This is Tom and Gerri.
- Tom and Gerri? That's brilliant!

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.999
Yeah, well...

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.235
We've learnt to live with it over the years.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.191
- So, what's your name again?
- Katie.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.195
Katie.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.310
- So have you been at the allotment?
- Yes.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.715
Gathering the last of the season's harvest.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.876
We've brought back some lovely tomatoes.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.433
- Yeah.
- Sounds gorgeous.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.558
- We were going to have a sandwich.
- Are you both hungry?

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.318
- I'm starving.
- She's starving.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.318
- I'll just go and change.
- Let me get out of this filthy clobber.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.271
- You go on through, Joe.
- All right.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.190
This is a lovely big kitchen, isn't it?

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.151
- It's gigantic.
- Shut up!

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.998
- Thank you for the flowers, Katie.
- Glad you like them.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.871
- They're lovely.
- They're all right.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.831
- Sit yourself down.
- Thank you.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.077
- So how did you two meet?
- Our eyes met across a crowded bar.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.997
We'd both been stood up by our dates.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.918
- Ah, the bonding of the jilted.
- Something like that.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.518
- Pretty much.
- When was this?

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.028
- Oh, about three months ago, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.310
- You never told us.
- Master of discretion.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.874
- I didn't know he had it in him.
- My enigmatic son.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.831
- You know me.
- Must be important.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.872
- Oh, he's a dark horse.
- I wanted to keep you a secret.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.196
- You son's a weirdo!
- Yes, we know. He's having treatment.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.832
Help yourself. Tuck in.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.676
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.553
- My mum and dad know all about you.
- Do they now?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.830
- And what do they do, Katie?
- Oh, my dad's a postman

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.551
and my mum works
on a make-up counter.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.192
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you work at?

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.073
- I'm an occupational therapist.
- Oh, are you? Where do you work?

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.156
- At the Royal Free.
- That's a great hospital.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.555
- It's pretty good.
- Do you specialise?

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.988
Yeah. Care of the elderly
and stroke rehab.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.234
What's straight rehab?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.433
Stroke rehab.

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:42.993
You are going deaf.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.917
Oh, stroke rehab.
I thought you said straight rehab.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.473
What's straight rehab?

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.875
What, for gay men who are on the turn?

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.754
Or straight men, who tried being gay,
but want to be rehabilitated into straight.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.310
- Joe tells me you're a counsellor, Gerri.
- Yes, I am, for my sins.

01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:02.558
But it's great to come home and feel like
you've made a contribution, isn't it?

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.749
Yes, of course.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.471
Or not, as the case may be.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.350
Oh, I'm sure you contribute.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:10.118
Not me. I'm talking about you lot
in the caring professions.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.673
- I don't care.
- We know.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.038
Hard man.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.430
And I know you're a geologist, Tom,
but what exactly do you do?

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:20.631
Ah, yes. Strictly speaking, I'm actually
an engineering geologist.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.591
- Which means that I...
- He digs holes.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.631
- I investigate...
- You dig holes.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.078
All right. I dig holes.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.759
That's just calling a spade a spade,
isn't it?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.268
- I always call it a shovel.
- You call it a fork.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:35.359
I call it a trailer-mounted-tripod
cable-percussive boring unit.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:37.957
And that's why I love him.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.069
No, I investigate
the ground beneath our feet

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.350
to test the feasibility of various
engineering and building projects.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:45.868
It sounds amazing. What are you
working on at the moment?

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.707
Ah, yes. Well, right now, the main project
is an eight-metre-diameter tunnel,

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.514
which is going to alleviate the pressure
on London's Victorian sewage system.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.515
Blimey.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.471
Eight metres? That's big.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.638
Oh, yeah. And it'll follow the path
of the Thames for 20 miles,

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.432
up to 80 metres underground.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.072
And that's just for this household.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.597
So, it's quite a big number.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.200
I'm not doing it on my own.
There's a few of us.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.879
- It won't be finished till after I'm dead.
- Oh, no.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.512
You'd better get a move on.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.991
Help yourself.
Is there anything you want?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.395
- Some ham?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm a veggie, actually.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.668
- Are you?
- Mm.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.756
This cheese is gorgeous, though.
Thank you.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.518
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.790
- What have you got planned later?
- Ah, yes.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.229
- We're having a visitation.
- Sounds ominous.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.589
- Mary's coming for tea.
- Oh, I was right.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.949
- Who's Mary?
- She's a friend from work.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.116
- Oh, right.
- Yes, she's... Yes.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.832
She's something else.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.279
I won't ask.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.150
- Ta-da!
- Oh, Joe!

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.111
How lovely to see you.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.116
This is a surprise. How are you?

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.037
- I'm good.
- Oh, you look great.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.991
- So do you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.797
Hello, Mary.
I'm Tom. I'm his father. I live here.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.193
Oh, Tom.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.878
My two favourite men.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.353
In you go.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.277
- You never rang me.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.392
Whatever happened to that drink
we were gonna have?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.273
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, Joe, you shouldn't have.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.550
- Hello.
- Katie, this is Mary. Mary, this is Katie.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.556
- Hello, Mary. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.955
- This is Joe's girlfriend.
- I like your jacket.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.831
Your mum gave me a pot of basil. Smell that.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.916
- She's going to make him some pesto.
- Lovely.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.269
- Shall I take your jacket, Mary?
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.914
- How are you, Mary?
- Yeah, I'm really good, thanks, yeah.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.871
- How was your journey?
- It was all right.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.792
- Oh, no, it wasn't actually.
- Didn't get lost again, did you?

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.956
Oh, no, the journey was all right.
It's the car.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.632
Is it OK?
- What happened?

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.477
- It wouldn't start.
- Oh, no.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.114
Yeah, it's a nightmare.
I had to come on the tube.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.071
And it got broken into last night.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.031
- Oh, sorry to hear that.
- Oh, no.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.958
Yeah, I did my big weekly
supermarket shop yesterday,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.878
which is great, I couldn't do that
before I had the car.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.037
I went nice and early,
so it wouldn't be dark when I got back.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:03.073
I brought three bags in, but I must have
left the fourth one on the front seat.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.588
I got in. I thought, that's great, that's done,

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.518
I can chill out now
and have a nice little glass of wine.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.551
I had a really nice evening, actually.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.555
Er...

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.797
But then, this morning,
I'm in the bathroom, I'm sitting on...

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.354
Cos it's the toilet roll that
I've left in the car.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.789
So, I rush out
and my window's been smashed.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.751
There's glass everywhere

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.950
and all my toilet rolls have been stolen.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.275
- It's probably kids.
I think you're right.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.673
Are you insured, Mary?

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.438
- Yeah, of course I'm insured.
- Well, that's something, isn't it?

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.755
You can't drive a car without insurance.
It's illegal.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.314
I know. At least you'll be able
to claim for your window.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.588
I know.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.758
Anyway, I'm... I'm sick of it. I just left it.
It's just a car. What does it matter?

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.597
Go on. Sit yourself down, Mary.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.279
- Put the kettle on, Tom.
- Yeah, yeah. Good idea.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.431
It's given me a lot of stress, Tom.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.278
This car's been a catalogue of disaster, hasn't
it?

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.469
I know.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.238
Cut your losses, Mary. Get rid of it.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.033
But I've spent so much on it, Tom.
I can't just sell it now.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.548
But if you keep it,
it's only going to get worse.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.034
- Well, you know what I think, Mary.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.310
I'm fed up with it, to be honest, Tom.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.237
I've had three punctures.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.918
- Three punctures?
- Yeah.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.872
My exhaust has fallen off. I had to get
a new one. My carburettor went.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.990
You can't take it back
to the guys you got it from?

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.794
No. They'd guarantee the labour for three
months, but not the parts. Bastards.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.593
Other way round, isn't it?
Parts for three months, not labour.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.595
No.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.352
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.551
Oh, I don't know. Anyway...
my windscreen wiper got ripped off.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.795
I got three points for speeding, at £60 each.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.195
So, I've got nine points on my driving licence.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.559
- Haven't I, Gerri?
- Yes.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.113
It keeps making funny noises.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.357
I got towed away and I wasn't even
parked on a double-yellow line.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.790
I've got seven parking tickets...
no, nine parking tickets.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.193
And then...

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.993
I broke down on the motorway
on the way to Brighton

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.951
and I got towed to Crawley,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.390
which is the last place I want to go,
because I grew up there and I hate it.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.069
So, I had to get the train home and then
the train back to Crawley the next day

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.872
and the guy kept trying to touch me up.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.037
It cost me nearly £500 and I never even
got my weekend in Brighton.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.150
That was supposed to be my summer holiday.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.030
Yes.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.832
- It's not fair, is it?
- No.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.519
- Well, never mind.
- Come and sit down, Mary. Relax.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.869
- Yeah, thanks, Joe.
- At least you're here now, eh?

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.110
- What did you say your name was?
- Katie.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.353
Oh.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.357
Well, the good news is, Mary,
I've made a cake in your honour.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.719
Oh, thanks, Gerri.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.069
She knew you were coming,
so she baked a cake!

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.998
- Don't forget to give me the recipe.
- No, I won't forget, Katie.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.270
- You haven't tasted it yet.
- Oh, it smells nice.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.029
Yeah, I wouldn't mind having the recipe
for that. I've never baked a cake before.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.275
- Of course you can.
- You can have a cake-off!

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.993
Oh, I don't think so.
I tried making a fruit cake once.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.508
Everything sank to the bottom.
It was horrible.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.152
You're a good cook.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.553
Thank you.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.672
- What about these two, then, Mary?
- Such a surprise.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.269
This monster hid this young lady
behind the sitting-room door.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.392
- Made me jump.
- I nearly gave poor Tom a heart attack.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.759
She passed the test.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.156
Surprised you passed the test.
I'd have got rid of you on the spot.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.838
A terrible way to treat someone.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.156
Yeah.
- We had absolutely no idea.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.918
- My big secret.
- Oh, thanks very much.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.871
It's obviously serious.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.038
Still, it's been really good to meet you both,
though, and we had a lovely lunch.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.672
You didn't say you were having lunch.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.235
- We have lunch every day.
- I know you have lunch every day, Joe.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.599
Bread and cheese.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.234
- Nothing special.
- I thought it was special.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.716
We had some tomatoes from Tom
and Gerri's allotment. Have you tasted them?

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.070
Loads of times. Gerri's always giving me
stuff, aren't you, Gerri?

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.680
- I'll give you some to take home, Mary.
- Oh, great.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.631
Oh, yeah, I can take them on the tube.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.871
So, what is it you do, then, Jackie?

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.239
Katie.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.273
- Katie.
- Don't worry. An occupational therapist.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.675
Oh.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.712
She looks after stroke victims
and the elderly.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.389
And... I grew up just down the road
from you, in Croydon.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.557
- I only went to college in Croydon.
- Oh, right. Which college?

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.278
Croydon College.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.753
The aptly named.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.276
So which course did you do? Secretarial?

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.550
What makes you think I'm a secretary?

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.511
Well, you are, aren't you?

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.630
- Gerri said...
- Yes.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.755
Well...

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.956
I got my diploma. I look after the doctors.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.399
Oh, brilliant.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.994
So have you two worked together
for a long time?

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.270
Ooh, about 20 years, haven't we, Mary?

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.275
Yeah.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.232
- Mary's known Joe since he was ten.
- No way!

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.919
I bet you've got some embarrassing stories.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.916
I've got some really nice stories, actually.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.758
Joe and I have shared some really
special moments, haven't we?

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.598
- Yes, Mary.
- It'll just have to be our secret, won't it?

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.232
She's almost like an auntie to him.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.599
I wouldn't say that.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.392
Well, we think of you as his auntie.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.839
Auntie Mary.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.632
I think that's really sweet.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.235
- Right. Who wants some cake?
- Yes, please.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.553
Auntie Mary.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.158
Thanks, Joe.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.758
Thanks, Mum.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.035
It must be really boring looking
after old people.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.672
No, I love it.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.712
You get to know them really well
and, well...

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.875
...we're all going to be old, one day,
aren't we?

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.433
Touch wood.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.948
Some of us already are.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.551
We look after old people, don't we, Gerri?

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.032
No, not in the same way.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.873
Amazing cake.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.433
Thank you, Katie.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.435
Right.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.198
We'll see you when we see you.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.595
- Soon. Hopefully.
- And you'll never know when.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.837
- Probably find you hiding in the shed.
- Or lurking in the bathroom.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.393
- Or down the toilet.
- Oh, nice!

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.590
- You must come to supper.
- Yes, please.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.200
I hear you're both excellent cooks.
No pressure.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.470
- Tom makes a mean curry.
- Oh, I love curry.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.274
- Well, there's been no litigation to date.
- I'll take my chances, then.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.719
- I'll speak to you later.
- Bye.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.398
- See you, boy.
- Bye-bye. Take care.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.635
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for the flowers.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.796
- A pleasure. Lovely to meet you.
- You, too.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.910
Bye, Mary. Really nice to meet you.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.871
Hope you get your car sorted out.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.478
- Bye, Katie.
- Bye.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.431
Bye.
See you soon.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.436
Yeah. Safe journey. Bye.
- Bye.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.918
How about that, then?

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.918
- That's a turn-up for the books.
- You're not kidding.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.713
- Excuse me, I've got a bit of work to do.
- All right.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.753
I was going to bring you some flowers, Gerri.
I just couldn't find anywhere open.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.199
Don't be silly.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.714
Gerri?

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.908
What?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.758
- What do you think of her?
- She's lovely, isn't she?

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.878
Well, I don't know.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.433
Joe likes her.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.198
Yeah, but, you know.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.196
They seem to connect.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.231
Well, he's only young, isn't he?

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.430
He's 30 years old, Mary.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.752
No, but what I mean is,
he doesn't want to rush into anything.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.631
He's only known her for five minutes.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.955
I think Joe knows what he's doing, actually.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.198
Well, I hope so.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.717
Don't forget your tomatoes, Mary.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.193
No, I won't.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.116
I should have brought a bottle of wine.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.558
- I might head off in a minute.
- All right, then, Mary.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.435
- Thank you for coming, Mary.
- Thanks, Gerri.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.152
- I'll see you on Tuesday.
- Yes.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:52.950
Yeah.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.433
- Bye, then.
- OK, bye.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.759
Very sad.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.313
Really upsetting.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.315
Yeah.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.351
- Are you surprised?
- Of course I am.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.913
No, I'm not, actually.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.915
No.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.518
It's disappointing.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.750
So, when are you inviting her round next?

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.913
Did you see this?

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.793
It's extraordinary.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.112
- I like whatshername.
- Katie?

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.720
- Yeah, she's a laugh, isn't she?
- She's lovely.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.711
He is a dark horse, our son.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.511
I think you'll find that we men are.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.911
Can you take that for me?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.591
Hasn't changed much, has it?

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.473
Hello, mate.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.918
How are you, Ron?

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.679
Hi, Ronnie.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.154
Do you recognise Joe?
- I've grown a bit.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.871
How are you managing, Ronnie?

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.831
I'll be glad when this is over.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.791
- This is the hardest day.
- Yeah.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.191
- She was a lovely person.
- She was.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.673
Very kind.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.200
Have you been eating
over the weekend, Ronnie?

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.798
I had some beans.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.229
Need a bit more than that, though, don't you?

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.191
Do you want something now?

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.195
Nah.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.151
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.998
- We brought a load of sandwiches, Ron.
- Some beers.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.718
So where's Carl?

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.478
I told him when and where.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.397
The question is, if he'll turn up.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.158
Well, that's up to him.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.758
He'd bloody better.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.669
Cheers, Gez.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.756
- The hearse will be here soon.
- Yeah.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.038
There you are, Ronnie.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.557
Can I have one of them beers now?

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.511
Yeah, you're all right. Go on.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.475
Ta.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.192
- Hello.
- Hello. Mr Hepple?

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.913
Yes, I'm Tom Hepple.
I think we spoke on the phone.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.598
This is my brother, Ronnie.

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.551
- Hello.
- He's Linda's husband.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.672
- Are you all ready?
- Yes, we are, yes. Just the four of us.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.116
Have you got the keys, Ronnie?

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.354
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.713
Thank you.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.108
Thank you.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.993
- Mr Hepple?
- Yes.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.951
This is Robert, your minister.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.831
- I'm Tom Hepple.
- Oh, yes.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.796
This is my brother, Ronnie,
Linda's husband.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.354
Robert Saunter.
I shall be taking the service.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.675
We're expecting Ronnie's son,
Carl, to be here,

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.711
but he doesn't appear
to have turned up yet.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.315
Right, well, we'd... best be started.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.509
Yes. Yes.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.471
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.113
Thank you.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.911
Air On The G String

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.638
Thank you.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.478
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
says the Lord.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.351
"Those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.472
Everyone who lives and believes in me
will never die."

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:12.958
I am convinced that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.151
nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come,

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.590
nor height, nor depth,
nor anything else in all creation

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:24.236
will be able to separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.313
We have entrusted our sister,
Linda Margaret, to God's mercy,

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.954
and we now commit her body to be cremated.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.955
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.834
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.030
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.355
who will transform our frail bodies

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.870
that they may be conformed
to his glorious body,

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.390
who died, was buried
and rose again for us.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.351
To him be glory forever.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.628
Amen.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.713
May God give you his comfort
and his peace, his light and his joy,

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.432
in this world and the next.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.436
And the blessing of God Almighty...

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.591
...the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
be upon you and remain with you always.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.358
Amen.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.913
You are welcome.

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.432
Enigma Variations IX Nimrod

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.350
You're joking, aren't you?

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.913
Hello, Carl.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.349
- Is that it?
- It's all over, Carl.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.913
I'm really sorry.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.233
That was just right.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.759
Thank you. God bless you.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.708
Unbelievable.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.318
Why couldn't you wait?

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.193
There's another one coming up behind us.
You can't wait.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.879
- They can't wait five minutes?
- No. We asked them.

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.831
- Outrageous.
- What happened to you?

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.713
- Motorway was fucked up.
- Should have taken that into account.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.318
- I did.
- Obviously not enough.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.920
I'll never forgive you for this.
You know that, don't you?

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.712
- Don't blame me.
- It's not his fault.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.876
I might have known
you'd pull a stunt like this.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.833
- Carl.
- What?

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.279
It's Joe.

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.953
Oh, yeah. All right?

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.598
Carl, I'm really sorry.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.155
We're going back to the house,
to your mum's.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.633
If you want to come...

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.036
- I gotta go back there, any road, so...
- All right. We'll see you there.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.718
Hello, I'm Tom. Ronnie's brother.

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.479
- We're going back to the house.
- Are you friends of Linda?

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.637
How long have you worked with her?
Are you coming back to the house?

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.148
- Good. We'll see you there.
- Do you have transport?

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.273
Do you know the way?

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.072
We'll see you there, then.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.391
Carl said he is going back.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.871
When was the last time you saw Carl?

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.353
A couple of years ago.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.516
Just turns up out of the blue, doesn't he?

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.471
When he can be bothered.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.351
When did we last see him?

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.909
I can't remember.
Five, ten years ago?

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.678
It was the year your mum died.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.869
- Was it?
- Mm.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.398
1979.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.476
- No.
No, '95.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.873
Yeah.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.148
Don't know.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.033
So, hang on.
When did he stay with us in London?

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.594
- That was in the '80s.
- You were nine.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.551
He always wore black, didn't he?

01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.555
Mm.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.919
It's tragic.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.871
He was such a lovely kid, full of fun.

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.233
Was he?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.713
Hi. Come on in.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.671
- Thanks, love.
- Hello. Come in.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.675
Hiya.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.836
- Do you want to go through?
- Thank you.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.508
- You find it all right?
- Aye, aye. No problem.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.109
- Shall I take your coat?
- Er... no, you're all right, duck, thanks.

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.878
Shall I take your coats, ladies?

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.638
- Thank you.
Right.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.069
Joe, is there another chair in there?

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.195
Yeah.

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.838
It was a very nice service.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.634
It was, wasn't it? Simple, straightforward.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.238
That's what you wanted, wasn't it, Ronnie?
Nothing fancy.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.838
No.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.753
Good job it didn't rain.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.189
- It's a nice spot that, isn't it?
- Mm.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.556
We've seen a few off from there,
haven't we?

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.830
- Aye, we have over the years.
- Aye.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.632
Have you worked with Linda for long?

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.750
About ten years.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.756
How about you, Maggie?

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.233
Not as long as that, no.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.399
She was a lovely lady.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.796
- She was, yeah.
- We weren't that close.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.638
- She'll be much missed.
- It was such a shock.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.072
Be a big change for you, Ronnie,

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.190
having to look after yourself.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.156
You get used to it though, Ronnie.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.911
- Eight years for me, now.
- Is it?

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.154
Aye.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.238
It's Carl.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.037
All right, Carl?

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.355
- 'Ey up, Carl.
- Excuse me, mate.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:53.189
- Do you want a drink, Carl?
- You got tea, beers...

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.117
...couple of bottles of wine.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.557
Sort myself out, ta.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.512
- Are you local, then, Frank?
- Aye, aye, I'm just a few streets down.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.835
- You know, Palmer's Street.
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.871
I haven't lived in Derby for 40 years.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.558
- How are you, Carl?
- All right. You?

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.158
We're all fine.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.316
This must have been
a bit of a shock for you.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.713
I'll say.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.276
- Where are you living?
- Up in Yorkshire.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.198
- Are you working?
- Don't need an interrogation.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.194
There's food out here
when you want it.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.151
It's all changed.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.469
- No post for me, then?
- No.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.917
None from you, either.

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.916
- Eh?
- There's none from you.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.596
Not lost your sense of humour, then?

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.753
Who sorted all this lot out?

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.439
- We did.
- We brought it with us.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.038
- From London?
- Yeah.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.957
Nice.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.877
You didn't get your arse in gear, Ronnie?

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.195
- He didn't need to, we offered.
- Did you?

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.073
- Yeah.
- It's his responsibility, though, in't it?

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.994
Don't underestimate
the shock he's had, Carl.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:05.032
Yeah, I know.
Very fragile, in't he, your brother?

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.829
- His wife's just died.
- His wife.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.916
Didn't much care for her
when she was alive.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.474
- Did you?
- I beg your pardon?

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.272
- Did you care for her, Carl?
- Tom?

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.992
- I cared for her in my own way.
- Carl.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.110
- What way was that?
- She knew how I felt.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.513
- Did she?
- Shut it.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.039
Don't tell me how to behave in my house.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.230
- It's not your house.
- It is, as much as it is his.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.076
Tom.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.879
- And what are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you, Carl.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.797
Well, I don't like it.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.591
Don't feel you need to hang about, duck.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.518
We best get going.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.073
Excuse me.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.916
I'm really sorry about this.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.074
Do you want your coats?
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.429
- Thank you for coming.
- Shall I drop you off?

01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.879
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.150
- Thanks.
- Is that... Can you do that, Frank?

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.758
Aye, aye. Give them a lift home.

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.950
Look after yourself, Ronnie.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.389
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about this.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.273
- One of those things.
- Aye, well, not to worry, duck.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.435
- See you.
- Thanks.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.277
- Take care. Ta-ta.
- Bye.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.511
Bloody hell.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.193
Are you all right, Ronnie?

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.196
I don't know what to do.

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.752
Ah, sod him.

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.471
He'll bugger off soon enough.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.079
Tell you what.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.076
Why don't you come back with us?

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.752
To London.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.800
No, no. You're all right.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.558
Well, why not?

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.076
Just for a few days, a week.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.791
Whatever it takes.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.988
Then we'll put you on the train back home.

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.271
I don't know.

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.351
Think about it.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.756
What do you reckon?

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.678
You might as well,
until you feel a bit better.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.313
- OK.
- Good.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.590
Chuck a few things in a bag.
We'll clear up.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.596
- Yeah.
- Have you got a bag?

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.755
I think so.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.155
Your dad's coming home with us
for a couple of days.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.952
Is he now?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.275
- I think there's one under the bed.
- Right.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.992
How did she go?

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.878
Eh?

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.836
She were dead when I woke up.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.711
Satisfied?

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.196
- Excuse me, Carl.
- I'll do that, Gerri.

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.310
- No, I'll do it.
- No, you leave it.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.271
You sit yourself down.

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.354
What am I doing this for?
Save my mam the trouble?

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.231
- She's fucking dead now.
- Listen to me.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.793
Nah, no, no, no, no.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.231
I'm going to get a bottle of wine.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.191
Carl, we've got loads of wine.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.151
Carl.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.351
He won't be back.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.237
Pyjamas. Get some shirts.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.309
- Are you going to change?
- Yeah.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.476
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.676
How you doing?

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.312
Are you all right?

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.316
Yeah, I'll be all right.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.471
We'll be off soon.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.797
Oh, hi.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.439
Is Gerri in?

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.511
No.

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.272
Oh.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:10.073
- Is Tom here?
- No, they're out.

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.113
What's it about?

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.320
I... I... I just wanted to see them.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.352
They didn't say nothing.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.311
Oh... Oh, no, they don't.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.349
I just came on the spur of the moment.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.114
I'm a friend of Gerri's. I work with her.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.674
Oh, have they gone to the allotment?

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.032
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.313
Can I come in?

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.631
Just to wait for them?

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.596
- I don't know.
- I'm really cold.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.199
I'm here on my own.

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.030
Oh, I'm not going to burgle you
or anything.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.832
I can give you a description of the house,
if you like?

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.668
When you go in the kitchen,
the cooker's on the right...

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.831
...and the sink's straight in front of you
and on the left is...

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.393
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right.

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.192
Thanks.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.791
I'm Mary.

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.351
What's your name?

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.550
Ronnie. Tom's my brother.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.511
Oh, oh.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.070
Is it your wife that's just passed away?

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.429
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry.

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.391
That's all right.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.240
Would you like me to make you
a cup of tea?

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.430
No, thank you.

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.795
Is it all right if I make one for myself?

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:22.075
I don't think Gerri and Tom would mind.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.351
All right.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.436
Have you come down for a few days?

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.471
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.876
I haven't had any breakfast.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.758
Did you have breakfast?

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.233
Yeah.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.191
- With Tom and Gerri?
- Yeah.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.071
Do you want a cuddle?

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.355
You sure you don't want some tea?

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.516
- Aye, go on, then.
- Yeah.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.637
Ooh, that's better.

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.551
It's really lovely to be here.

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.671
I haven't been for months.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.793
They invite me a lot.
We're really old friends.

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.711
Are you sleeping in Joe's room?

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.988
Yeah.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.837
Oh, yeah.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.950
All his little bits and bobs.

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.833
Did he go to the funeral?

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.074
Yeah.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.511
With his girlfriend?

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.471
- No.
- Oh.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.638
They're coming round later.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.556
Oh, are they?

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.470
Sorry I'm such a mess.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.312
I didn't get to bed till five
and then I couldn't sleep.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.515
I just got up and came straight here.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.230
Does Gerri ever mention me?

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.115
No.

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.472
Mary.

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:12.519
No.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.799
You look like Tom.

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.998
Oh, aye?

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.314
Yeah.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.158
You've got a nice face.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.396
Tom's got a nice face, too.

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.676
What was your wife's name?

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.555
- Linda.
- Oh.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.312
Was she nice?

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:15.478
Did you have dinner last night?

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.080
- We had chicken.
- Oh, lovely.

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.314
- They're good cooks, aren't they?
- Yeah.

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.392
I can't cook.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:28.515
- Can you cook?
- Nah.

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.871
I didn't really eat anything yesterday.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.078
Do you want some toast?

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.871
No, I'm all right, thank you.

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.511
Wouldn't mind a cigarette, though.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.669
- Do you smoke?
- Yeah.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.631
Oh, good.

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.233
Oh, yeah. My friend used to roll her own.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:06.553
Do you want one of these?

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.120
No, it's all right.
I'll have one of mine.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.673
Oh, no, go on, then.
For old time's sake.

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.994
Yeah.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.471
We have to go out there.

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.518
Oh, we can stay in here, can't we?
They won't know.

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.233
Ooh.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.191
Takes me back.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.676
Did you ever smoke dope?

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.716
Tried it a few times.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.118
We used to.

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.956
Me and my best friend, Monica.

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.670
Don't see her any more.

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.671
Did you like the Beatles?

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:04.913
They were all right.

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.994
I was more Elvis. Jerry Lee Lewis.

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.632
Yeah.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.433
# I'm all shook up

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.549
Heh.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:22.239
Have you got any children?

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.554
Got a son.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.153
Is he married?

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.508
Don't know.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.831
You got kids?

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.233
No.

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.512
Unfortunately.

01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.111
Have you got to go back soon?

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.753
Yeah. Got a few things to sort out.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.830
I don't suppose your son will help you.

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.711
Nah.

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.311
I could come up and give you a hand,
if you like.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.157
Have you got to move?

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:26.996
No.

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:32.076
I could take a few days off work.

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.712
Are you warm enough?

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.830
Oh, I'll be all right.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.996
We'll just finish these.

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.875
Oh, do you know Ken?

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.592
Ken?

01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.119
Yeah.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.196
Yeah. Did he go to the funeral?

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:03.639
No.

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.676
He's a bit weird, isn't he?

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:08.589
Is he?

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.872
I don't really smoke.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.350
I had too much to drink last night.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.755
I had a bit of a bad day.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:34.917
My car broke down.
It had to be towed away.

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.396
They said it wasn't worth repairing.
They gave me 20 quid for it.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.069
- That's not much.
- No. What can you do with 20 quid?

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.994
I bought myself a bottle of champagne.

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.109
Yeah?

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.312
Yeah.

01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:58.318
Did you finish it?

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.314
Yeah, I did.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.112
Huh.

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:16.755
I might have to have
a little bit of a lie down.

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:26.428
It's really lovely
to have someone to talk to.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.793
Yeah.

01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.351
It's peaceful here.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.634
I might move away somewhere else.

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.071
Start again.

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.236
I used to work in Majorca.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.558
They'll be back soon.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.511
Oh, yeah.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.718
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.631
- Hello, Ronnie.
- We're back.

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.634
Hi, Gerri.

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.271
- Hello, Mary.
- Bloody hell!

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.629
- Hi, Tom.
- What are you doing here?

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.435
Well, I just thought I'd...

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.078
Just get my boots off.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:07.552
- Where'd she spring from?
- Bloody nuisance, especially today.

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.511
You're not kidding.

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:22.551
- Are you all right, Gerri?
- Yes, Mary, I'm fine.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.673
Did you drive?

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:30.631
Oh, no. I came on the tube.

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.193
Did you?

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.355
It might have been nice
if you'd phoned first, Mary.

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.311
Oh, I'm really sorry.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.560
- Joe and Katie are coming.
- Yeah, Ronnie said.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.471
All righty.

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.348
Tea, Ronnie?
- Yeah.

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:12.235
Come and sit yourself down, Mary,
and have a cup of tea.

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.791
How's it going?

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.796
Inexorably.

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:46.230
- I don't know what to do.
- Well, if you don't, I don't.

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:48.191
I can't just chuck her out.

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.797
- Can't you?
- No.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:53.673
- Look at the state of her.
- I know. Poor woman.

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.635
Joe and Katie will be all right.
They can handle her.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.194
I know. I've got enough food for her.

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.834
- That's all right, then.
- Oh, well, here goes.

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.112
- Do you want me to give you a hand?
- No, thank you, Mary.

01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.077
Would you like to stay for a bite to eat?

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.997
No, it's OK. I don't want to be in the way.

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.076
You won't be. We've got plenty of food.

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:34.071
Are you still angry with me?

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:38.639
Mary, I wasn't angry with you.
I just felt you'd let me down.

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.591
Oh, Gerri.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.671
I'd never want to do that.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.233
I'm really sorry.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.191
Yes, and I know you apologised.

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.599
I miss you.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.356
I mean, I know I see you at work,

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:03.960
but we don't seem to talk to each other
any more.

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.790
- I feel terrible.
- This is my family, Mary.

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.671
You've got to understand that.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.631
I do.

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.159
Oh... Come here.

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.359
You have to take responsibility
for your actions.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.311
I know.

01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:49.591
Now, listen, Mary.

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.195
You need to talk to somebody.

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:56.151
Oh, no, I don't want to do that.

01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:00.437
- Well, I think it would help you.
- I just want to talk to you.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:04.029
Why don't I have a word
with one of my colleagues?

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.674
As long as we're friends,
then I'm all right.

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.679
Well, that's beside the point. You need
independent, professional help.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.597
You'd be much happier.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.718
Let's talk about it on Tuesday.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.671
- Yeah.
- And you have a think.

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.351
Yeah, we could have a drink.

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:23.311
Why don't you help me lay the table?

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.791
He's really nice Ronnie, isn't he?

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:55.432
Hello. I saw you through the window.

01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.959
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.718
- I'm fine, how are you?
- I'm good.

01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:01.593
- Katie, lovely to see you.
- Ahh, lovely to see you.

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.119
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.071
Mary's here.

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.190
- Hello!
- Aha!

01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.155
- We brought you some chocolates.
- Good. Ha-ha!

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.634
- Oh, no, give them back!
- You'll never see them again.

01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.750
- Can I take your things?
- Yeah, cheers.

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.752
Dear, dear.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.439
I've got the longest scarf in the world.
Sorry.

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:25.994
- And a tea cosy on my head.
- Come and meet Ronnie.

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.837
- Oh, great.
- Mary's here.

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:28.869
Oh!

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:31.512
- Hi, Katie.
- Hi, Mary. How are you?

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.073
- Good, thanks.
- Excellent.

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.314
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.555
Hi, you must be Ronnie.
I've heard a lot about you.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.477
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Hello.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.033
- This is Katie.
- My big brother.

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.150
- Ah, brilliant.
- What are we having to drink?

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.760
- I'll have what everyone else is having.
- Red wine for me.

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.438
- We're having fish.
- I'll have white.

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.835
- I'll have white wine as well, please.
- Beer, Ronnie?

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.359
- Yeah.
- White wine, Mary?

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:53.039
- Yeah, please, if that's all right?
I'll do that, Gez.

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:55.275
I'll get you a beer, Ronnie.

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.993
So, I hear you're a massive Derby fan, Ronnie.

01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.917
- Er... yeah.
- Great club.

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:02.394
I'm a Palace supporter myself, for my sins.

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:06.069
I still hope we might crash back through
to the Premiership, at some point.

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:07.792
What do you reckon
to Derby's chances?

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:10.195
- I don't know, not so bad.
- Well, fingers crossed.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.394
We met on our first day
at university in Manchester.

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.431
Oh, your first day!

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.311
We were in the same halls of residence.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.998
We met on the stairs.
- Yeah.

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:30.031
I was falling down them,
she was going up them.

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:33.231
- I was falling up them.
Things haven't changed, then.

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:39.629
And Tom's first job, when we left uni,
was abroad for two years.

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:42.194
Did you try not to take it personally?

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:44.708
We came down to London, didn't we?
For about nine months.

01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:48.639
I got my first geologist's job
in Western Australia in the outback.

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:49.396
Right.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:51.351
It was him
and a load of Australian cowboys.

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:55.439
- It was like the Wild West out there.
- Yeah, all cork hats and beers.

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:58.677
- You've worked in Australia, Katie.
- Yeah, I worked in Sydney for a year.

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.315
I had a wonderful time. They know
how to enjoy themselves, the Aussies.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.588
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:06.677
And you came out and visited,
didn't you, my first Christmas holiday?

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:08.631
Yeah.
We spent Christmas on the beach.

01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:10.318
- Barbie on the beach?
- Yeah.

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:14.148
And when Tom had finished after
two years, I joined him again and we...

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.794
- You went on your grand tour.
...we came back overland.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.990
Yeah. It took us seven months, I think.

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.679
We got the boat
from Fremantle to Singapore

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.553
and then Singapore to Malaysia
and then onto Thailand.

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.750
Thailand. Burma.
And to India.

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:29.155
- I'd love to go to India.
- We went trekking in Nepal.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.317
Nepal, trekking in Nepal.
The beach at Goa.

01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:35.397
- Wonderful, holiday of a lifetime.
- Pakistan.

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:38.113
- Afghanistan. Iran.
- Turkey.

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.674
- Over to the Greek Islands.
- Greek Islands.

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:44.076
The wonderful thing was, because
I'd been in... two years working in Australia,

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:47.669
and earning relatively good money,
and nothing to spend it on, really.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:50.188
So, we didn't have to do it
on a really tight budget.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.993
Some people could just hitch,
but we could get buses and trains.

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.634
- Yeah, yeah.
It must have made a difference.

01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:59.752
You've been to the Greek Islands,
haven't you, Mary?

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.633
- Yeah.
- Which island was it?

02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:04.477
- Corfu.
- Yeah.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:08.229
- What were you doing on Corfu?
- Oh, I only ran a bar on the beach.

02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:10.350
You were a cocktail waitress?
- Yeah.

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:14.957
When are you going to Paris?
Oh, a week on Friday.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.035
Yeah.

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:19.277
- We've got an early start, 6:22 train.
- Oh, no.

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:21.231
- Yeah.
We get in at Paris, what is it?

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.191
- About quarter to ten?
- Yeah, 9:50.

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.357
- Have breakfast by the Seine.
Have you got your hotel booked?

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.994
Yeah, we've got a lovely hotel.
Very nice, yeah.

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:31.395
Beautiful. In the Marais area.
- Oh, yeah?

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.351
It will be brilliant for Christmas shopping.

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.960
When are you coming back?
On Sunday.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.560
- Short weekend.
- Not enough time to do all the things.

02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.511
We'll cram it all in.
- We'll try.

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:43.074
- You can walk everywhere.
- Yeah, yeah.
