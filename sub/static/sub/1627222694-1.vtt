10:01.350 --> 10:03.227
Hi, Miss Amy! You guys get through it?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.437
[Amy] Still here.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.149
-[JJ] She totally looked at me.
-[John B] I saw it.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.526
-Dude, look at this place.
-[JJ whistles]

10:10.610 --> 10:14.071
-Agatha, what did you do?
-[John B] She is a crazy lady.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.489
-[JJ] Hard-core.
-Phew.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.241
-[JJ] Hurricane surge.
-Yeah.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.578
-[JJ] We'll be cleaning this all summer.
-[John B] That is my nightmare.

10:20.661 --> 10:24.040
-Well, look who we have here.
-[JJ whoops]

10:24.123 --> 10:26.959
[John B] We have a safety meeting.
Attendance mandatory.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.545
-[mimics static]
-I can't. My pop's got me on lockdown.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.755
Come on, man. [mimics static]

10:30.838 --> 10:32.048
Your dad's a pussy. Over.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.050
Oh, I heard that, you little bastard.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.010
-We need your son.
-[JJ] Yeah, and island rules.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.553
Day after a hurricane's a free day.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.347
-[Heyward] Who made that up?
-[JJ] Uh...

10:39.430 --> 10:41.432
Pentagon, I think.
We have security clearance.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.225
-I have a card.
-[Heyward] Think I'm stupid?

10:43.309 --> 10:46.020
-I'll do it tomorrow. I promise. Tomorrow.
-You think-- No, no.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.022
Hell no. You doin' it right now.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.650
-[whispers] Get in the boat.
-[JJ] Make a run for it.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.069
-Boy, if you get in that boat--
-[JJ] How does that feel?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.737
-Go, go, go.
-Bring your ass back up here.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.489
-I promise I'll do it tomorrow, Dad.
-Whoo!

10:56.572 --> 10:58.366
[Heyward] You gonna clean shrimp,

10:58.449 --> 10:59.533
-clean fish.
-Love you, Pops.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.286
-You'll clean your dirty-ass room!
-We'll bring him back in one piece.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.664
-I promise!
-And I don't like your friends!

11:06.582 --> 11:08.501
[JJ] Oh, top o' the mornin' to ya.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.919
-Good morning.
-[John B] Morning.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.338
[Pope] Whatcha got?
You got some juice boxes?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.840
[Kie] You know, just some yogurts
and carrot sticks.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.134
-How about my kind of juice box?
-Yeah.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.302

11:36.362 --> 11:37.321
Terrifying.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.115
[JJ] Hey, Pope.
Can you go a little faster?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.033
-Here we go. I'm movin'.
-[John B] Doesn't work.

No shit.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.150
Ugh, this is probably
gonna mess this whole place up.

-[John B] Congrats, JJ.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.742

12:29.206 --> 12:30.207
It's a boat!

12:31.292 --> 12:33.461
[Kie] Holy shit, he's right. Let's go.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.465
[Pope] You think
there's a dead body down there?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.676
-Guys, wait up!
-[Kie] Whoo!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.511

-[John B] Come on!

13:04.492 --> 13:06.160

13:07.912 --> 13:09.663
-What the...
-[boys laughing]

13:09.747 --> 13:10.831
That's a Grady-White.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.375
A new one of those is like 500 Gs, easy.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.006
-Okay!
-[JJ] That's a primo rig.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.258
Yeah. That's the boat I saw
when I surfed the surge.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.261
-Maybe it hit the jetty or something.
-You surfed the surge?

13:24.345 --> 13:26.138
-[John B] Yeah.
-That's my boy. Pogue style.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.348
[Kie] What the heck?

13:27.431 --> 13:29.558
Wait, wait. Do we know whose boat that is?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.811
[John B] No, but we're about to find out.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.479
[JJ] Dude, it's too deep.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.981
Oh, for the weak and feeble, JJ.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.735
[JJ] Well, I'm not resuscitating you.
I'm just making that clear up front.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.861
[John B] That's fine.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.488
-John B.
-[chuckles] What?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.448
-[Pope] Diver down, fool.
-[John B sighs]

13:44.532 --> 13:46.242
-Diver down. [grunts]
-Yeah, he is.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.687
[Pope] Should we go get him?

Any dead bodies?

-Looting potential?
-[John B] No. No.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.404
I found this motel key.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.948
-[Pope] A key.
-[John B] Yes, a key, Pope.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.908
[JJ] Great! We salvaged a motel key.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.911
[Kie] Guys, we should report the wreck
to the coast guard.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.747
-Maybe we'll get a finder's fee.
-[JJ] Yeah, and not work all summer.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.374
Thanks, Agatha, ya batch.

-[woman 1] Not since before the storm.

14:55.811 --> 14:56.979
[man] What did the police say?

14:57.062 --> 15:00.024
Well, they said I have to wait 24 hours
before I can report anything,

15:00.107 --> 15:01.400
but I know something's wrong.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.443
[man] Nothing is wrong.

15:02.526 --> 15:05.446
You know, it's Scooter.
He knows how to handle himself in a storm.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.781
[woman 1] Well, when was the last time
that you saw him?

15:08.324 --> 15:12.077
[man] Uh, last time I saw him,
he was prepping the Druthers with Sarah.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.164
Sarah!

15:17.333 --> 15:19.543
-You seen the princess?

Thank God. It's like living in Nicaragua.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.554
It didn't fall near the house.
It completely uprooted it.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.140
Oh, look at this.
Storm blew it right into the pool.

Be careful with that.

-I don't wanna know how much it cost.

I can't post anything.

Wheezie, there was a hurricane,
sweetheart.

-[Cameron] What are you doing?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.785
The burrows filled with water
from the surge.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.412
The birds are having a field day.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.289
[Cameron] The birds have to eat too,
Sarah.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.750
[Sarah] No,
it's a mouse genocide out here. No!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.503
The cycle of life is what it is,
sweetheart. Now, come on.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.756
I can't be a part of it.
First they came for the mice, Daddy.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.800
-I have a human being...
-[Sarah] Oh, my God.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.218
-...you might help.
-Hi.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.929
-I'm Sarah. I'm so sorry.
-[Cameron] This is Lana, Scooter's wife.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.931
You were storm prepping
with him, right?

16:14.014 --> 16:16.433
Yeah. He helped me latch the cabin
on the Druthers.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.768
-Last night?
-Yeah.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.186
And did he go out after that?

16:19.269 --> 16:20.437
-From here?
-Yeah.

16:20.521 --> 16:24.400
-No. Are you crazy? There was a hurricane.
-Well, did he say where he was going?

16:24.483 --> 16:26.944
Get a phone call or mention anything?

16:27.528 --> 16:29.196
He didn't say anything to me.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.949
-I'm so sorry. Is he okay?
-He's absolutely okay.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.326
-I hope so.
-[Cameron] He's hunkered down somewhere.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.828
-We'll find him.
-[Sarah] Sorry.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.621
-Thank you.

-somewhere with a six-pack...

to the coast guard. It's a dog.

[man 2] Your boat? We're not worried
about your boat right now, okay?

17:09.653 --> 17:10.946
Well, that went well.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.531
So, what's the plan?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.659
I know how we're gonna find the guy
who owns that boat.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.786
We don't know whose room that is.
It could be anyone.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.998

-Come on. I'll be lookout.

at least you'll only be an accomplice.

I thought the Château looked bad.

17:36.930 --> 17:40.434
-[John B] This place is a shitshow.
-[Kie] Motel or meth lab?

17:40.517 --> 17:41.935
[Pope] You be the judge.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.646
[John B] Doesn't look like a place
somebody with a Grady-White stays.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.900
[Pope] No. Looks like a place someone
with a Grady-White would get killed.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.359
All right. Here we go.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.780
[JJ] This is your captain speaking.

-Hey.
-[John B] Yeah?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.165
Don't let him do anything stupid.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.209
-Oh, we will.
-I'm not making promises.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.543
Yeah, I know.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.295
Uh, be careful.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.340
I mean it.

Yeah.

Let's go.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.139
Why are all these mattresses out?

18:19.223 --> 18:21.600
[JJ] After a hurricane,
they ditch 'em 'cause they're moldy.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.894
Just be so careful, John.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.687
-God, you're so weird.
-What was that about?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.648
I don't know.
Maybe she wants us to be careful.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.360
Since she heard you're being threatened
with exile, she's just been, like,

18:31.443 --> 18:34.154
-"Oh! Be so careful, John B."
-[John B] Get off.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.241

When are you gonna swoop on that, man?

No Pogue-on-Pogue macking.

-You're the one always hitting on her.
-Of course I'm hitting on her.

She's a super-hot, rich, hippie chick
slumming with us.

Why? I can't figure it out either,
but who cares, bro?

20:15.505 --> 20:18.383
Easy.
Giving one percent to the environment.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.094
-What's wrong with that?
-We only have one Earth, Pope.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.805
We should be giving it 100 percent,
bare minimum.

Right. That's not fiscally sound.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.483

25:26.566 --> 25:29.069
[man] Well, I was up at the Mason Outlet,

25:29.736 --> 25:32.113
and, uh, I seen this lump,

25:32.697 --> 25:35.784
and the crabs
was just goin' to town on it, you know?

25:36.243 --> 25:40.288
So, I figured the best thing to do was,
uh... throw him over in the ice chest

25:40.372 --> 25:42.791
-and then call y'all.
-[paramedic] Six-seven. Call the ME.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.960

[John B] Who's that?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.599
[girl] It's Scooter Grubbs.
He was out during the storm.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.476
Check out this pic I got.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.228
Dead body.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.397
Insane.

26:05.855 --> 26:06.856
Holy shit.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.400
What kind of boat did he have?

26:08.483 --> 26:10.986
Somehow, that dirtbag copped
a brand-new Grady-White.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.946
Everyone's out looking for it.

26:21.288 --> 26:25.375
[panting] Okay.
So, um... we didn't see anything.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.668
We don't know anything.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.837
We need to have
total and complete amnesia.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.131
Actually, Pope's right for once.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.216
See, I agree with you sometimes.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.093
Deny, deny, deny.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.553
Guys, we can't keep that money.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.389
Okay. Not all of us can afford
unlimited data plans, Kiara.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.099
We have to pass that off to Lana Grubbs.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.851
Otherwise, it's bad karma.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.186
Bad karma to be implicated
in a felony, too.

26:45.895 --> 26:46.896
We gotta go dark.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.233
If that means we get to keep the money,
then I agree.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.321
I don't agree.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.948
-What? Why?
-Just think about it.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.908
This is Scooter Grubbs
we're talking about.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.369
Same dude that's buying
individual cigarettes at the Porthole.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.539
Shit, one time I saw this dude begging
for change in the Save-A-Lot parking lot

27:04.623 --> 27:05.582
because he needed gas.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.500
We're talking about a dirtbag marina rat

27:07.584 --> 27:09.461
who's never had
more than 40 bucks in his pocket,

27:09.544 --> 27:13.340
and all of a sudden,
he's got a Grady-White? Just sayin'.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.969
All right, so think about it, Pope.
How does a marina rat get a Grady-White?

27:18.053 --> 27:21.097
-[inhales sharply] Prostitution.
-Square groupers, bro.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.392
Okay, flying under the radar,
no aerial surveillance.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.519
They don't do that stuff
during a hurricane.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.730
What does that mean? JJ?

27:29.147 --> 27:31.274
-They were straight smugglin'.
-Smugglin'.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.527
And I guarantee
there's a serious amount of contraband

27:34.611 --> 27:36.446
-in that wreck.
-Hell, yeah.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.074
Fish on!

27:39.157 --> 27:41.368
For the record,
if that is a smuggling ship

27:41.451 --> 27:43.495
with illegal contraband
on the inside of it...

27:43.578 --> 27:45.413
-Mm-hm?
-...it probably belongs to someone else.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.041
-Minor details.
-They could come looking for it.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.294
Taking it
would be catastrophically stupid.

27:51.878 --> 27:56.174
Right. Well, stupid things
have good outcomes all the time.

27:57.133 --> 28:00.470
[JJ] All we need to do is figure out a way
to get into the cargo hold of that wreck.

28:00.553 --> 28:02.847
Until then, we just lay low.
Just act normal.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.392

40:20.334 --> 40:22.962

on this island now?

40:25.506 --> 40:30.094
Okay. Can we drop
the whole Pogues versus Kooks thing?

40:30.678 --> 40:32.430
It is really stupid.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.931
[sighs] Oh...

40:34.014 --> 40:36.016

Now, all kiddin' aside,

40:53.576 --> 40:56.704
your job today is to help keep privates
off the marsh

40:56.787 --> 40:59.373
so we can do our job and find this wreck.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.041
That's straight from Sheriff Peterkin.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.335
Do not forget your sunscreen, ladies.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.920
Bring a lot of liquids.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.547
[woman] Does that include Natty Light?

41:06.630 --> 41:10.759
I don't care what swill you bring.
That's on your own recognizance.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.721
All right.
What else do you got to worry about?

41:13.804 --> 41:14.847
Let's go!

41:14.930 --> 41:17.308
Pull that for me, will you?
Thank you, ma'am.

41:17.391 --> 41:19.435
Bill, I'mma get at ya about that
tomorrow, all right?

41:19.518 --> 41:21.270
-We're here about the missing boat.
-Yeah?

41:21.353 --> 41:23.647
-What can I do for you fellas?
-Associates of the owner.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.567
-Here to help however we can.
-Uh-huh. Right.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.820
We're devastated about Scooter.
We just feel sick about it.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.407
You mind if we join your armada?
Take a look for ourselves?

41:35.618 --> 41:38.204
Yeah, why not? Extra set of eyes.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.207
We'll let you know
if we find anything, Officer.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.876
-You do that.
-[engine starts]

41:57.097 --> 42:00.226
-This is empty. You took empty tanks?
-I...

42:01.894 --> 42:03.521
Okay, this one's a quarter full.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.022
It's enough for one of us.

42:05.481 --> 42:07.233
Love it when a plan comes together.

42:07.733 --> 42:09.235
Does anybody know how to dive?

42:09.944 --> 42:10.986
Uh...

42:11.570 --> 42:14.031
-Anybody?
-It's kind of a Kook sport.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.492
-[sighs]
-I... read about it.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.744
Great, Pope read about it,
so someone's gonna die.

42:18.827 --> 42:22.122
Look, y-you put the thing in your mouth
and breathe. How hard could it be?

42:22.206 --> 42:24.291
If you come up too fast,
nitrogen gets into your blood,

42:24.375 --> 42:25.334
and you get the bends.

42:25.417 --> 42:28.546
-Bends like, bend over and...
-[Pope] The bends kill you.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.549
-[JJ] Right.
-I can-- I can dive.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.343
-[JJ] You can dive. I'm cool with that.
-[Kie] Since when can you dive?

42:34.426 --> 42:35.678
I'll do it. It's fine.

42:35.761 --> 42:38.389
-Let me do some calculations real quick.
-You serious?

42:38.973 --> 42:41.976
-[Pope] That boat's about 30 feet down.
-Okay.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.144
[Pope] So it'll take 25 minutes
at that depth.

42:44.228 --> 42:45.229
Twenty-five.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.899
Which means you need to make
your safety stop at about... ten feet.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.651
All right? For two minutes.

42:50.734 --> 42:53.070
[John B] Yeah, yeah.
Ten feet, two minutes. Got it.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.700
-Uh...
-[Pope] What was that all about?

42:57.783 --> 43:00.035
I don't know, but I liked it. A lot.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.328
-[clears throat]
-[JJ] Uh, so...

43:01.412 --> 43:03.122
-[Pope] All righty.
-Yeah. Uh, when you--

43:03.205 --> 43:05.624
uh, when you're down there,
you look for the cargo hold.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.252
You stick this thing inside
and twist and pull, okay?

43:08.335 --> 43:10.129
-[John B] Stick in, twist, pull.
-[JJ] Yeah.

43:10.212 --> 43:12.423
-My dad moved weight back in the day.
-[Pope] Who didn't?

43:12.506 --> 43:16.302
Hey! I tied my T-shirt to the anchor chain
about ten feet down.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.137
It's where you need to do
your safety stop.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.055
-[John B] Cool.
-[Pope] Keep an eye on this.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.683
You need to make sure
you have enough air to decompress.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.560
Okay, how much do I need?

43:25.477 --> 43:27.980
Unclear. Breathe as little as possible.

in the marsh,

we're basically screwed, so...
