00:57.809 --> 00:59.811
<i>What is
the meaning of life?</i>

01:02.063 --> 01:03.732
<i>Are we here for a reason?</i>

01:07.485 --> 01:09.446
<i>Is there a point
to any of this?</i>

01:14.451 --> 01:17.078
<i>First, I had no idea
what was going on.</i>

01:17.162 --> 01:18.830
<i>I, I couldn't see a thing.</i>

01:20.331 --> 01:21.750
<i>It was warm.</i>

01:23.001 --> 01:24.669
<i>There was my mother.</i>

01:25.837 --> 01:27.589
<i>Every day I had fun.</i>

01:29.007 --> 01:30.633
<i>Was having fun the point?</i>

01:31.718 --> 01:33.052
<i>The whole point?</i>

01:33.970 --> 01:36.097
<i>No, it couldn't be
that simple.</i>

01:38.892 --> 01:41.144
Here's one.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.645
<i>And then it was over.</i>

01:43.688 --> 01:44.981
That's it for you.

01:47.358 --> 01:48.860
<i>No more fun.</i>

01:50.820 --> 01:53.281
<i>It seemed like
such a short life.</i>

01:54.324 --> 01:57.035
<i>I mean,
what exactly did I do?</i>

01:58.119 --> 02:01.414
<i>There was some playing.
There was some eating.</i>

02:02.332 --> 02:03.708
<i>I dug in the dirt.</i>

02:04.793 --> 02:08.505
<i>But when I really thought about it,
it didn't add up to much.</i>

02:11.466 --> 02:14.344
<i>I was back.
And I was a puppy again.</i>

02:14.677 --> 02:19.432
<i>Alive and ready to ask the big questions,
to dig for answers.</i>

02:19.516 --> 02:21.017
<i>Just let me in there.</i>

02:22.101 --> 02:24.062
<i>Um, where am I?</i>

02:25.230 --> 02:27.065
So, what else do you have?
This one here.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.900
Ah.

02:29.234 --> 02:31.486
What is it?
It's a Red Retriever.

02:36.241 --> 02:39.369
Nice dog. Good breed.
Easy to train.

02:39.452 --> 02:40.620
You got something smaller?

02:41.120 --> 02:43.498
I got some cute Yorkies over here.
Ah.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.708
I got this Japanese Chin.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.585
A poodle.

02:48.253 --> 02:49.379
Corgi over here.

03:11.109 --> 03:13.403
<i>Look at
all this great stuff!</i>

03:13.486 --> 03:15.113
<i>Somebody knew
I was coming.</i>

03:17.365 --> 03:18.658
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

03:20.702 --> 03:22.620
Hey. Look at this.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.626
What do we have here?

03:30.461 --> 03:31.921
Look at this little guy.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.798
Bet it's worth
a couple of bucks.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.887
Yeah, it was a knockout in the
second round. I lost everything.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.221
Hang tight, guy.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.265
Now, you're buying this time.

03:42.807 --> 03:43.975
Not today, buddy.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.687
<i>I thought
about my life.</i>

03:48.771 --> 03:50.815
<i>I still had
so many questions.</i>

03:51.691 --> 03:53.985
<i>But I kept coming back
to the same one.</i>

03:54.986 --> 03:57.071
<i>How do I get
a drink of water?</i>

03:58.907 --> 04:01.027
- Do you wanna get an ice cream?
- Sure.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.869
What flavor?

04:02.952 --> 04:04.746
Mom, I hear
something in there.

04:04.954 --> 04:05.997
Hey, honey!

04:06.456 --> 04:08.166
Ethan.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.709
Hey, Mom.
Come here.

04:13.630 --> 04:14.923
Oh, my God.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.382
It looks so thirsty.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.134
It's too hot in there.

04:18.593 --> 04:21.404
- I think we need to get him out.
- I can't open the door.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.640
Wait. It's locked.
Please, Mom!

04:23.806 --> 04:25.058
Okay. Stand back.

04:31.648 --> 04:33.274
You poor thing.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.527
You poor, poor thing.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.709
How are you, boy?
Good?

04:52.752 --> 04:54.003
<i>What is this?</i>

04:54.087 --> 04:55.797
Mom!
<i>A boy?</i>

04:57.131 --> 04:59.050
Boy? Are you okay?
<i>A boy!</i>

04:59.133 --> 05:01.678
<i>I never knew there might be
such a thing as a boy.</i>

05:02.720 --> 05:05.306
I think this little guy
is gonna make it.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.350
- Can we keep him, Mom?
- I don't know.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.394
I think your father
might mind.

05:09.644 --> 05:11.562
<i>I decided,
right then and there...</i>

05:12.021 --> 05:14.148
<i>I am definitely
keeping this boy.</i>

05:17.360 --> 05:19.946
Yeah. Dad!
Can we keep him?

05:20.029 --> 05:21.239
Well, who's gonna feed him?

05:21.739 --> 05:22.782
I will.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.326
Who's gonna clean him?
I'll do everything, Dad.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.620
You think you're ready to do it?
Yeah.

05:28.037 --> 05:30.748
I don't know, son. He's a good boy.
He's a good boy.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.962
Come on. Please!
He's a retriever, Dad.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.881
He'll fetch your slippers.
And the paper when it rains.

05:38.965 --> 05:41.509
Name something you want fetched.
He can do it.

05:42.010 --> 05:45.805
Look. Just come here.
What are you doing?

05:47.974 --> 05:51.686
So, Ethan and I discussed that the
dog would be his responsibility.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.021
Good boy.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.313
Please, Dad?

05:55.314 --> 05:57.025
Come on.
He needs a pal.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.697
All right, this thing that you two are doing?
It's dirty pool, okay?

06:02.864 --> 06:04.866
Take him away.
I wanna talk to your mother alone.

06:04.949 --> 06:05.950
Okay.

06:08.870 --> 06:11.122
You nervous, boy?
Don't be.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.415
It'll be okay.
Yeah.

06:12.498 --> 06:13.600
We don't
have much choice.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.227
They make a mess,
then you gotta clean them.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.377
Oh, come on.

06:16.461 --> 06:18.261
He's gonna be bored with it.
Oh, come on, Jim.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.214
No!
You know how he is.

06:20.298 --> 06:23.843
If he says no, we can run off
and go find another family.

06:25.595 --> 06:27.305
Ethan.
Yeah?

06:28.806 --> 06:30.016
You have a dog.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.769
Yes! Oh, my gosh! Yes!

06:32.935 --> 06:34.437
Come on, boy!

06:34.604 --> 06:36.898
Whoo! Yes.

06:37.106 --> 06:40.193
Oh, my gosh! Thank you!
Come on! Come on!

06:42.403 --> 06:43.404
Bailey.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.365
B-A-I-L-E-Y. I would think.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.284
And I'm Ethan.

06:49.452 --> 06:50.578
I'm the owner.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.539
Do you think he knows
how to spell my name?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.416
I would think so, honey.

06:58.086 --> 06:59.170
Good boy.

07:00.713 --> 07:01.881
Here you go.

07:02.298 --> 07:03.299
Ready?

07:03.466 --> 07:04.634
Come on, Bailey.

07:04.801 --> 07:07.136
Bailey, sit! Sit!

07:07.512 --> 07:10.139
Roll over! Roll over.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.311
Get that out of your mouth!
Get that out of your mouth!

07:15.478 --> 07:16.729
Okay. Come here!

07:16.896 --> 07:18.523
Shake your paw.
Shake your paw.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.608
Come on. Yeah! Good boy.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.443
Turn around.
Turn around. Come on.

07:22.777 --> 07:24.904
<i>What's he saying?
It's too many words.</i>

07:25.363 --> 07:26.364
<i>I'm gonna do this now.</i>

07:26.447 --> 07:28.449
Come here.
Good job.

07:28.616 --> 07:31.244
<i>But one word got said
more than any other.</i>

07:31.327 --> 07:33.329
Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.541
<i>After a while, I came to understand
the words that mattered.</i>

07:37.250 --> 07:40.253
<i>I had a boy,
and his name was Ethan.</i>

07:40.419 --> 07:41.712
<i>I got a name.</i>

07:42.213 --> 07:44.632
<i>My name was Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.</i>

07:44.799 --> 07:47.385
<i>Oh, gee. I wish I'd have
known that you and Wes were...</i>

07:48.010 --> 07:49.679
<i>I learned
my place in the pack.</i>

07:50.221 --> 07:51.722
<i>Mom liked me.</i>

07:52.098 --> 07:53.391
<i>Dad liked me.</i>

07:53.474 --> 07:54.475
Yes.

07:54.725 --> 07:55.726
<i>A lot.</i>

07:55.852 --> 07:57.061
Excuse me. Hold on.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.313
Come on. Get down!

07:59.397 --> 08:00.690
<i>I was sad for the cat.</i>

08:00.815 --> 08:03.109
<i>Obviously, he wanted to be a dog.</i>

08:03.609 --> 08:05.444
<i>It wasn't my fault
he couldn't be a dog.</i>

08:08.239 --> 08:09.740
Ethan, it's time
to go to bed.

08:09.824 --> 08:11.492
Time to turn out
the light, okay?

08:11.576 --> 08:12.577
Okay.

08:20.418 --> 08:23.087
Okay, come on.
Come on, come on.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.134
"Don't! Don't do it, Cap."

08:28.301 --> 08:29.343
"Let him have it, Bucky.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.512
"We'll pound some sense
into this character."

08:31.929 --> 08:32.929
"Pow!"

08:33.597 --> 08:34.765
"Stop!"

08:35.683 --> 08:38.394
"It's coming right at us.
Jump for your lives!"

08:38.477 --> 08:41.022
<i>Ethan always came up
with such great games.</i>

08:41.147 --> 08:43.316
"Boom!" <i>Making
noise under a blanket?</i>

08:44.275 --> 08:45.276
<i>Genius.</i>

08:45.359 --> 08:47.069
"Way too long. Zap!"

08:47.153 --> 08:48.529
<i>Every night
as I fell asleep,</i>

08:48.613 --> 08:51.616
<i>I thought about how happy I
was that I had an Ethan.</i>

08:52.325 --> 08:54.118
<i>And that I wasn't a cat.</i>

09:00.166 --> 09:02.126
- Bailey, get in the car.
- Come on, boy!

09:03.169 --> 09:04.170
Come on.

09:12.261 --> 09:15.014
<i>I wanna know</i>

09:15.932 --> 09:18.142
<i>If you'll be my girl</i>

09:20.603 --> 09:22.438
<i>Hey</i>

09:23.314 --> 09:25.794
<i>Whenever the family wanted
me to get some fresh smells,</i>

09:26.108 --> 09:27.944
<i>we all got in the car
for a ride.</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:33.491
<i>Grass, tree, toad,
moss, skunk,</i>

09:33.574 --> 09:37.036
<i>dead skunk, pond,
mud, goat.</i>

09:37.703 --> 09:38.746
<i>Goat!</i>

09:40.706 --> 09:43.709
<i>Everyone was asking themself
the same question.</i>

09:43.793 --> 09:45.878
<i>Why can't everything
smell like goat?</i>

09:45.962 --> 09:46.963
Oh, it stinks!

09:51.592 --> 09:53.552
Oh, boy, look who's here.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.887
Guess what we got!

09:54.971 --> 09:56.472
What have you got?

09:56.555 --> 09:57.848
What'd you get?

09:57.932 --> 09:59.100
Come on, Bailey!

10:00.518 --> 10:02.603
Look at this!
Oh! A puppy!

10:02.853 --> 10:04.146
Here, boy. Here.

10:04.897 --> 10:05.898
Hey!

10:09.652 --> 10:12.571
<i>Sometimes I thought that
trying to make sense out of life</i>

10:12.655 --> 10:14.031
<i>could be a waste of time.</i>

10:14.532 --> 10:17.743
<i>Maybe it was better to
just really enjoy life.</i>

10:17.994 --> 10:19.328
<i>And leave it at that.</i>

10:24.917 --> 10:26.085
Come on, boy!

10:28.004 --> 10:29.797
<i>Hey! Where'd everybody go?</i>

10:29.880 --> 10:31.090
<i>Where's all the chickens?</i>

10:31.173 --> 10:33.050
Bailey! Bailey, Bailey!

10:37.680 --> 10:39.765
<i>Ethan, Ethan, Ethan!</i>

10:39.849 --> 10:40.891
Yeah!

10:40.975 --> 10:42.727
Oh, my goodness!
Look who's here!

10:42.810 --> 10:45.313
<i>For some reason, they wouldn't
share this ball with me.</i>

10:45.396 --> 10:46.814
Yes! Run, Ethan, run!

10:46.897 --> 10:49.457
<i>Everybody knows there's never been
a game in the history of balls</i>

10:49.483 --> 10:51.319
<i>that can't be improved
by having a dog in it.</i>

10:53.904 --> 10:57.074
<i>But there was something
weird about this ball.</i>

10:59.660 --> 11:01.078
<i>Treasure.</i>

11:02.621 --> 11:04.457
Oh, no.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.667
<i>Ah, this is the life.</i>

11:08.210 --> 11:09.795
Anyone else?
Jim, your coffee.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.589
Thank you.
Here you go.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.466
Here we all are.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.259
Yeah. Enjoying a meal.

11:15.843 --> 11:19.055
<i>I liked the old humans.
They got me.</i>

11:22.933 --> 11:24.894
Would you please
stop feeding the dog?

11:25.770 --> 11:26.854
We're trying to train him.

11:26.937 --> 11:27.980
I told you.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.483
You caught me.
I'm sorry.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.194
Could you pass me
the jam, please?

11:33.694 --> 11:36.614
<i>When I wasn't thinking about food,
my mind wandered.</i>

11:37.782 --> 11:40.368
<i>Why am I here?
What's the purpose?</i>

11:40.910 --> 11:44.330
<i>Oh, yeah. Keep rubbing.
And might there be more bacon?</i>

11:44.914 --> 11:47.041
Oh, look at his plate.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.810
You know, the way you eat,
you're gonna grow up

11:48.834 --> 11:51.337
to be bigger than
all of us put together.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.339
If there's a world
to grow up in.

11:55.383 --> 11:57.760
These Russians are
putting missiles in Cuba.

11:58.386 --> 12:00.262
Do we have to
talk about that now?

12:00.346 --> 12:01.347
No.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.475
So, Jim, I hear you're
up for a new office job.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.827
Why don't you
tell us about that?

12:05.851 --> 12:07.061
That didn't work out.

12:07.395 --> 12:08.896
Well, they want him
in the field.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.689
He's one of the top
sellers every year.

12:11.065 --> 12:12.900
I got the job nobody wants.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.403
Jim. Do you have to?

12:15.778 --> 12:18.531
We're three seconds away
from nuclear annihilation.

12:19.115 --> 12:21.534
Uh, can me and Bailey
be excused?

12:22.118 --> 12:23.160
Sure.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.039
<i>Ethan was sad.</i>

12:27.206 --> 12:28.833
<i>And I didn't know why.</i>

12:32.336 --> 12:33.504
Hey, Bailey.

12:33.963 --> 12:35.297
Captain America. Remember?

12:35.881 --> 12:37.842
He could take out
that bomb in a second.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.303
Pow!

12:53.941 --> 12:54.942
Zap!

13:03.784 --> 13:05.995
Oh, you like it,
don't you? Oh.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.500
Come on! Come on!

13:11.667 --> 13:12.668
Yeah, boy.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.005
Okay, Bailey. Get it, boy!

13:18.215 --> 13:19.216
Whoo!

13:19.300 --> 13:21.552
Come on! Yeah, boy!
Come on!

13:21.635 --> 13:23.429
Come on.
Oh, where'd it go?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.681
Come on, boy.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.935
Get it, boy!
Come on! Come on! Get it!

13:30.019 --> 13:33.647
<i>We played with that ball
all afternoon. Ethan loved it.</i>

13:33.731 --> 13:34.732
Good boy!

13:35.107 --> 13:37.193
Get it! Come on!

13:38.068 --> 13:40.154
Hey, Dad! Watch this!

13:41.155 --> 13:42.615
Look what he can do.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.909
Okay, Bailey. Ready?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.327
<i>Ready.</i>

13:46.494 --> 13:47.828
Stay. Okay.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.373
And...

13:52.208 --> 13:53.250
Okay.

13:53.334 --> 13:54.418
Go, Bailey!

14:00.633 --> 14:01.675
Out!

14:01.759 --> 14:03.302
That's great, pal.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.596
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, come on.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.309
Yes! Yes!
Come on. Come on.

14:10.935 --> 14:13.854
<i>When it got colder outside,
we all went back home.</i>

14:13.938 --> 14:15.105
You'll be fine.

14:15.189 --> 14:18.734
<i>Every morning, a big yellow box with
wheels took Ethan away from me.</i>

14:29.119 --> 14:30.913
<i>When Mom
left the house, too,</i>

14:32.164 --> 14:33.582
<i>I was lonely</i>

14:34.291 --> 14:35.876
<i>and hungry</i>

14:37.503 --> 14:39.088
<i>and bored.</i>

14:40.714 --> 14:42.716
<i>At least they left the cat.</i>

14:43.384 --> 14:45.177
<i>I'd give him
his dog lessons.</i>

14:47.680 --> 14:49.348
<i>Ugh! So much to learn.</i>

14:49.932 --> 14:53.435
<i>No! Dogs do not hide under pillows.
Come on.</i>

14:54.103 --> 14:56.230
<i>Come on. Sniff me.</i>

14:56.522 --> 14:57.731
<i>Sniff me!</i>

14:58.023 --> 14:59.316
<i>Argh!</i>

14:59.692 --> 15:01.318
<i>You don't know anything!</i>

15:04.446 --> 15:06.490
<i>Wow, you clear
your throat a lot.</i>

15:11.954 --> 15:12.955
Bailey. No.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.176
Hi, Dad.

15:26.969 --> 15:27.970
Elizabeth.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.015
Elizabeth!

15:32.558 --> 15:33.601
Hello?

15:34.643 --> 15:35.644
Hey!

15:35.728 --> 15:39.106
That's my slipper!
Bailey! Bailey! Get back here!

15:39.273 --> 15:40.274
Bailey, no!

15:41.525 --> 15:43.485
Bailey. Come here.

15:43.652 --> 15:47.239
Come here. Come here.
Bailey, come here.

15:48.616 --> 15:50.427
<i>When Dad was in the right mood...</i>
Come on, let go.

15:50.451 --> 15:52.620
<i>...he was so much
fun to play with.</i>

15:52.703 --> 15:55.080
That's not yours, Bailey.
That's mine. That's mine!

15:55.164 --> 15:56.624
You come over here.

15:56.707 --> 15:57.791
Come on!

15:59.960 --> 16:03.005
Ethan, my boss is
coming over tonight.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.633
And he cannot see my office like this.
Do you understand?

16:06.467 --> 16:08.594
You have got to start telling
this dog who's boss.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.804
Here, take him.
Just take him.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.389
And you say,
"I am the boss!"

16:12.806 --> 16:14.933
You gotta show him
who's boss.

16:16.644 --> 16:18.455
All right, everything goes
back where it belongs.

16:18.479 --> 16:21.106
I want this place spick and span,
do you understand?

16:21.190 --> 16:23.609
Well, do you understand?
Do you understand?

16:23.692 --> 16:25.402
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.908
"I want everything
just the way I like it.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.451
"Spick and span.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.829
"Why? Because I'm the boss,
that's why."

16:35.913 --> 16:36.997
I'm the boss man

16:37.706 --> 16:39.333
and you're the boss dog.

16:42.670 --> 16:43.754
Boss dog.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.006
Boss dog.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.467
Boss dog.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.511
Boss dog!

16:51.929 --> 16:52.930
Ethan.

16:53.555 --> 16:56.475
Come on. Let's go. We got
guests coming any minute.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.726
Chop chop.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.525
Jim?
What?

17:04.900 --> 17:06.777
- Jim, can you help me?
- Huh?

17:07.111 --> 17:09.231
I don't know how
to make a Singapore Sling.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.531
What?

17:11.448 --> 17:12.616
I'll show you.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.536
I can make a Whiskey Cobbler.
Wait, here's the recipe.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.875
Saint-Gaudens,
1907, golden eagle.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.461
Real gold.

17:27.673 --> 17:28.799
No!

17:28.882 --> 17:30.050
<i>Ethan was good to me.</i>

17:30.968 --> 17:32.594
<i>He always shared his food.</i>

17:32.678 --> 17:34.805
Do you have it in your mouth?
Did you swallow it?

17:34.888 --> 17:37.933
<i>Wasn't my favorite treat.
And he wanted it back.</i>

17:38.016 --> 17:39.017
<i>Why?</i>

17:42.062 --> 17:43.313
We made it.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.857
Hello! Ellen.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.316
Come in. Welcome.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.695
I am glad we were finally able
to make it out here because

17:49.778 --> 17:52.948
I have been wanting to visit the
field office for a while now.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.450
Oh, yes.

17:54.533 --> 17:58.370
And it's so nice and quiet
out here in the suburbs.

17:58.454 --> 17:59.830
It sure is. Yeah.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.373
Well, we're happy
to have you.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.876
Um, so, I've been
meaning to say

18:03.959 --> 18:07.880
we're real impressed with your
numbers this past year, Jim.

18:07.963 --> 18:08.964
Real impressed.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.591
You know, I'm glad
you brought that up.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.595
I've actually been meaning
to talk to you about that.

18:14.678 --> 18:18.098
I was thinking,
with the numbers so high,

18:18.182 --> 18:22.519
maybe it's time I get off the
road and take an office position.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.939
Well, we really
need you on the road.

18:26.023 --> 18:29.067
That's the backbone of the
whole operation, really.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.964
I'll be honest, Jim. You are one
of our best traveling salesmen.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.449
I mean, I would be crazy to
take you out of the field.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.211
Um, are you
still collecting coins?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.378
Oh, sure.

18:48.462 --> 18:49.922
What's your showpiece?

18:51.715 --> 18:55.010
1907 Saint-Gaudens
golden eagle.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.596
Well, Herman,
I don't know anything about coins,

18:57.679 --> 18:58.931
but I know that
that is special.

18:59.014 --> 19:02.059
That is a treasure. I have never
seen one up close before.

19:02.810 --> 19:03.930
It's quite a coin.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.977
Yeah, it's a beauty.
I'll show you. I'll go get it.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.524
Maybe after dinner.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.818
Let me go
get it later.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.444
May I please be excused?

19:12.820 --> 19:13.821
Huh?

19:14.446 --> 19:18.242
May I please be excused?
And take Bailey out for a walk?

19:19.284 --> 19:20.410
Sure, honey.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.790
Go on. Do it.

19:24.873 --> 19:28.043
Please, Bailey.
Please, Bailey, do it. Come on.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.670
<i>What does
he want from me?</i>

19:30.045 --> 19:31.630
Come on. Come on.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.591
<i>I really wish I knew
what he was saying.</i>

19:34.967 --> 19:36.510
Go! Go! Come on!

19:36.593 --> 19:38.136
What's your problem?
Come on!

19:40.722 --> 19:44.601
<i>I don't know why he was so upset,
but it made me anxious,</i>

19:44.685 --> 19:48.397
<i>and when I'm anxious,
things kind of move super-fast.</i>

19:53.527 --> 19:55.028
<i>This was a first.</i>

19:55.195 --> 19:57.948
<i>I'd never seen him so happy
to clean up after me.</i>

19:58.031 --> 19:59.783
Yes! Found it!

20:01.618 --> 20:03.704
It's important that it
shouldn't be too sweet.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.706
See this?

20:05.789 --> 20:08.667
Now this. That's something
for your eyes to feast on.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.294
No!
What?

20:10.878 --> 20:12.462
There's a rat!
What?

20:12.546 --> 20:13.755
Right there!
Where?

20:13.839 --> 20:15.173
No, I don't like rats.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.508
Where is it?
Under the table!

20:16.592 --> 20:17.676
<i>I love rats.</i>

20:17.759 --> 20:19.094
Yeah. Go get it, Bailey!

20:19.511 --> 20:21.722
I don't see anything.
It's right over there.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.307
Whoa, get that dog!

20:23.390 --> 20:25.350
Get the dog! Get the dog!

20:25.434 --> 20:27.185
I don't see anything.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.479
Right there.
Maybe you saw Smokey.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.732
- Definitely not Smokey.
- It wasn't Smokey.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.233
I really don't like rats.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.277
It's more scared of
you than you are of him.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.946
Come here,
Bailey! Come here!

20:38.030 --> 20:39.698
Bailey! Bailey! Come here!

20:40.490 --> 20:41.759
- Come here!
- Please, Bailey.

20:41.783 --> 20:42.868
Can you grab him, Jim?

20:44.369 --> 20:46.204
Hang on. Come here.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.497
I think it's gone now.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.794
What was that?

20:53.837 --> 20:56.048
- Herman!
- Bailey, come here!

20:56.131 --> 20:57.132
Come here!

20:57.633 --> 20:59.259
You got him, Jim?
You got him?

21:06.558 --> 21:09.144
Any chances I had of
a promotion, forget it!

21:09.686 --> 21:12.481
Dad! Stop!
It's not his fault!

21:12.564 --> 21:14.024
You made us
look like fools!

21:14.107 --> 21:16.443
<i>Dad always talks so
loud when he smelled this way.</i>

21:16.526 --> 21:18.212
Jim, why don't we
take a moment before we...

21:18.236 --> 21:19.636
From now on,
he stays out here.

21:19.696 --> 21:20.948
He didn't do anything!

21:21.823 --> 21:25.035
I do not want to see him.
I do not want to see him in the house.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.203
But it's cold outside!

21:26.286 --> 21:27.430
Well,
he's got fur for that.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.806
We should
at least set out a blanket.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.040
It's a dog!

21:31.166 --> 21:32.167
<i>Ethan?</i>

21:34.920 --> 21:38.256
Hey, boy. Good?
I'm so sorry.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.175
It's all my fault.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.302
<i>Even though
I couldn't see him,</i>

21:42.386 --> 21:44.721
<i>I knew Ethan was
very sad that night.</i>

22:22.050 --> 22:23.427
Hey, boy!

22:25.846 --> 22:27.806
It's cold out there,
isn't it?

22:29.474 --> 22:31.184
<i>I knew he needed me.</i>

22:32.602 --> 22:34.438
<i>And I needed him, too.</i>

22:35.063 --> 22:37.190
You're a good boy.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.654
Ready, boy? Okay.
Come here. Come here.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.198
Come on, Bailey.
Okay, boy. Ready?

22:45.490 --> 22:47.701
Three, two, one...

22:47.868 --> 22:48.869
Come on!

22:53.457 --> 22:54.517
Yeah, boy!

22:54.541 --> 22:55.625
Oh, come on.

22:55.709 --> 22:56.793
Let's do it again.

23:07.637 --> 23:08.805
Yes!

23:11.683 --> 23:13.727
Nice throw, Ethan.
Nice throw.

23:14.686 --> 23:15.854
Nice play!

23:15.937 --> 23:17.814
Great pass, Ethan.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.903
You just get it
to him every time.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.072
Yeah, exactly. 'Cause every
time you run that play...

23:25.155 --> 23:27.741
<i>Everybody wanted to
walk next to the alpha male.</i>

23:29.117 --> 23:30.660
<i>Almost everybody.</i>

23:31.912 --> 23:33.997
Ethan, why do you always
have this dog with you?

23:34.498 --> 23:37.000
What? It's like a girlfriend
replacement or something?

23:37.918 --> 23:40.188
- Yeah, good one, Todd.
- Give her a little kiss, huh?

23:40.212 --> 23:41.338
I'm just asking.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.464
<i>Excuse me.</i>

23:45.634 --> 23:46.843
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.

23:46.927 --> 23:49.387
Did my girlfriend
replacement just trip you?

23:49.471 --> 23:50.639
Very funny.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.391
Relax, man.
The dog's laughing at you.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.685
Dogs don't laugh, you moron.
Bailey, come here.

23:57.938 --> 23:59.314
<i>That's funny.</i>

23:59.397 --> 24:01.483
Got everything?
Yeah.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.568
When Lou dropped
that pass at the start?

24:03.652 --> 24:05.612
I thought we were
done, man. Here.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.241
Bailey, come here!

24:11.785 --> 24:12.911
Hey, Dad.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.143
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.686
I got
a casserole in the oven.

24:20.710 --> 24:21.795
Yeah?

24:21.878 --> 24:24.315
<i>Africa is home to
hundreds of thousands of animals.</i>

24:24.339 --> 24:25.924
<i>Some look comical,</i>

24:26.550 --> 24:28.135
<i>some forbidding,</i>

24:28.552 --> 24:31.763
<i>and some so entrancing,
that we'd like to reach out...</i>

24:32.055 --> 24:34.808
So, uh, Coach made me
starting quarterback today.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.060
That's great, kid.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.690
You gotta come to
my next game, Dad.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.609
I'm serious. I'm better now.
It's been a long time.

24:46.278 --> 24:47.320
Okay.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.662
<i>Poor Dad.</i>

25:04.504 --> 25:06.256
<i>Wow, wow.</i>

25:06.715 --> 25:07.841
<i>This place is great!</i>

25:07.924 --> 25:09.676
<i>Oh, there's so
much to smell here!</i>

25:09.759 --> 25:11.052
<i>And eat!</i>

25:11.136 --> 25:12.554
<i>Oh, it's everywhere!</i>

25:12.929 --> 25:14.931
<i>Feed me! Feed me!</i>

25:28.737 --> 25:31.114
<i>Ethan had a different
smell all of a sudden.</i>

25:31.198 --> 25:32.782
<i>A sweaty smell.</i>

25:34.492 --> 25:37.954
<i>Hmm, I wonder if that girl
had anything to do with it.</i>

25:38.455 --> 25:39.497
No!

25:39.581 --> 25:41.333
Hey, hey, Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.043
Whoa!
Sorry.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.629
Sorry. That was the dog.
That wasn't me.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.464
I wouldn't do that.

25:47.839 --> 25:50.800
Okay. Well, maybe you should
teach your dog some manners.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.802
I've been trying.
He's not too smart.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.429
Really?

25:54.804 --> 25:58.141
Did you hear what he said about you?
You look pretty smart to me.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.101
Oh, yeah.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.937
Such intelligent eyes.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.564
<i>My butt itches.</i>

26:05.065 --> 26:06.775
What's your name, handsome?

26:07.400 --> 26:09.361
He's Bailey. Bailey. Yeah.

26:09.444 --> 26:10.820
Bailey.

26:10.904 --> 26:13.114
Now you seem like
a very good dog, Bailey.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.324
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

26:14.407 --> 26:16.034
Nice job.
Oh. Thank you.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.078
Nice!

26:18.787 --> 26:19.871
Yeah. Oh!

26:20.580 --> 26:21.748
Keep that away from him.

26:21.831 --> 26:22.958
Okay, okay, okay.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.293
You're really good at that.
Thanks.

26:25.377 --> 26:28.088
Like, really good.
I was watching you over there.

26:29.339 --> 26:30.757
Okay.
Not like that.

26:32.968 --> 26:33.969
See ya.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.972
Hey. If we never
speak again,

26:37.055 --> 26:38.932
I just wanna take back
what I said before

26:39.015 --> 26:40.684
about my dog
not being smart.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.060
He's actually really smart.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.521
Definitely smarter than me.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.983
<i>Now they both
had a sweaty smell.</i>

26:48.066 --> 26:51.319
You wanna get a hot dog
or something? Popcorn?

26:53.238 --> 26:54.239
Sure.

26:54.739 --> 26:56.241
Okay, let's do it.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.868
There's some good ones over here.
Hey, Bailey, come here.

27:13.383 --> 27:14.801
<i>I wanted to save them,</i>

27:14.884 --> 27:16.261
<i>but I didn't know how.</i>

27:22.559 --> 27:24.352
- Come on.
- Are we done?

27:24.436 --> 27:26.187
Oh, that was good.
Never again.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.981
No, it was fun!

27:28.606 --> 27:29.733
Thank you.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.067
Oh!
Whoa!

27:31.443 --> 27:33.820
<i>Uh-oh. Ethan's in trouble.</i>

27:33.903 --> 27:35.905
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.910
<i>Oh, don't worry, Ethan!
I'll help!</i>

27:40.994 --> 27:42.620
Hey, hey. No, no, no!

27:42.704 --> 27:43.997
Stay back! Stay back!

27:44.080 --> 27:45.248
Bailey, no, no.

27:45.332 --> 27:46.416
<i>But I'm helping!</i>

27:46.499 --> 27:50.337
Stop! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.
Stop. Stop. Hey, no.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.220
Okay.
Yeah.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.931
Thank you. Thank you
both for the ride.

28:02.098 --> 28:05.101
<i>Why did
I eat so many meat logs?</i>

28:05.185 --> 28:06.686
Yeah,
we should do something.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.646
Yes, that would be nice.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.941
It was fun.
It was.

28:12.609 --> 28:14.694
Except for having to
pay for 28 hot dogs.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.321
<i>Excuse me.</i>

28:18.073 --> 28:19.074
Whoa!

28:19.157 --> 28:21.326
Yeah, you better go.
You better go quick.

28:21.576 --> 28:22.994
Bye.
See ya.

28:24.913 --> 28:28.166
<i>From that moment on,
the girl was a member of our pack.</i>

28:29.042 --> 28:30.168
<i>I liked her.</i>

28:30.251 --> 28:32.045
<i>Plus, she smelled
like biscuits.</i>

28:34.964 --> 28:36.966
<i>We spent
every day together.</i>

28:37.967 --> 28:39.094
That a boy.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.471
Ready, Bailey? Ready?
Here we go. Yeah. Go, go.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.473
Oh, good boy!

28:43.556 --> 28:45.308
What a dive!
What was that?

28:45.767 --> 28:48.770
Swim! Oh, good boy!
Bring it back!

28:50.480 --> 28:52.399
Come here, boy.
Attaboy.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.818
Come on.
Oh, good boy!

28:55.819 --> 28:56.820
Good boy.

29:01.533 --> 29:03.201
Watch your head.

29:06.621 --> 29:08.331
- No, it's not okay.
- No.

29:08.415 --> 29:10.125
Besides, I'm going.
Fine.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.334
You don't listen to me.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.378
Every time I ask you where
something comes from...

29:13.420 --> 29:15.380
You tell me!
You tell me where it's going!

29:15.463 --> 29:16.965
'Cause I earn it!
I earn it!

29:17.048 --> 29:18.716
You wanna go
to town instead?

29:20.009 --> 29:21.010
Yeah.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.931
Bailey!
Come on, Bailey.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.728
<i>And I thank you</i>

29:33.606 --> 29:34.607
Come on.

29:35.316 --> 29:36.359
Right?

29:36.734 --> 29:38.528
<i>And I thank you</i>

29:41.197 --> 29:44.200
<i>Hey, bop, bop, bop, bop</i>

29:45.743 --> 29:47.412
<i>We howled together.</i>

29:47.912 --> 29:50.498
<i>And sometimes,
we would sit in the car</i>

29:50.957 --> 29:52.667
<i>not even going anywhere.</i>

29:54.961 --> 29:57.714
<i>Ethan and Hannah would
wrestle and lick each other.</i>

29:58.798 --> 30:00.383
<i>Are they fighting over food?</i>

30:03.303 --> 30:05.638
<i>Maybe Hannah's hiding
something in her mouth.</i>

30:07.432 --> 30:09.684
<i>Nope. Nothing in there.</i>

30:09.767 --> 30:11.394
What's going on with you?

30:11.478 --> 30:12.812
He loves you.

30:12.896 --> 30:15.523
<i>But no matter how much
he looked for food in there,</i>

30:16.149 --> 30:17.859
<i>he never found anything.</i>

30:19.152 --> 30:20.445
<i>And he looked.</i>

30:20.945 --> 30:21.946
<i>A lot.</i>

30:22.238 --> 30:23.406
Let's go.
Okay.

30:29.704 --> 30:31.247
You can feel it.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.500
Summer's ending.

30:35.293 --> 30:36.878
Best summer ever.

30:37.212 --> 30:38.254
Yeah.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.215
I don't wanna
go back to school.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.592
Yes, you do.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.013
I do?

30:47.472 --> 30:48.473
Yes!

30:49.307 --> 30:52.727
You are going to get a big football
scholarship at a good school.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.497
And then I'm gonna
apply to that school

30:54.521 --> 30:55.897
and get an academic
scholarship.

30:56.064 --> 30:59.400
And then we'll both be at college,
and we'll never be apart.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.362
Wow, you've got it
all planned out, huh?

31:02.529 --> 31:03.988
Yes, indeed.

31:06.533 --> 31:07.700
That's a good plan.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.118
Mmm-hmm.

31:10.995 --> 31:12.205
Right, Bailey?

31:12.372 --> 31:14.624
<i>What?
What did you say?</i>

31:17.335 --> 31:18.753
- See ya.
- Bye!

31:21.089 --> 31:22.131
Bye!

31:22.590 --> 31:23.800
See you tomorrow!

31:26.928 --> 31:28.221
Good boy.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.147
I gotta go.

31:38.273 --> 31:40.251
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting some beer.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.919
All I asked was
for you to lower your voice.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.152
Stop! Stop! Stop!

31:43.236 --> 31:45.446
Will you please
just keep it down?

31:45.530 --> 31:47.031
My parents
are upstairs, Jim.

31:47.115 --> 31:48.533
I'm sorry.
You're right.

31:48.616 --> 31:52.495
Fine, I will stop doing it then.
I'll just go. I'll just leave.

31:52.579 --> 31:54.499
- Does that sound good to you?
- Come on, boy.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.210
No, just tell me. Just tell
me if you'll be happy.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.713
Just go! I'm gonna go.
Fine, I'll go!

32:01.796 --> 32:04.340
Will you just come back inside?
Stop it, Elizabeth!

32:04.424 --> 32:06.467
Shut up! Shut up!

32:06.551 --> 32:08.386
I'm trying
to help you, Jim.

32:08.469 --> 32:09.697
You're trying to help me?
You wanna help me?

32:09.721 --> 32:10.972
You're my wife, Elizabeth.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.890
You should support me.
I do support you.

32:13.266 --> 32:15.066
Will you just come back inside?
Hey. Hey, pal.

32:15.518 --> 32:16.519
Hey.

32:18.354 --> 32:19.606
You spying on me?

32:20.356 --> 32:21.441
What?

32:21.524 --> 32:22.734
You spying on me?

32:22.817 --> 32:24.611
Leave him alone, Jim.
Come here.

32:24.694 --> 32:25.945
Oh, you got something to say?

32:26.029 --> 32:27.864
I just got home.
Come here.

32:35.913 --> 32:37.415
Look at how he looks at me.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.335
I am so sick of the way
you look at me. Relax.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.104
Look at how you look at me.
What are you doing?

32:42.128 --> 32:43.808
This has
nothing to do with him!

32:43.880 --> 32:45.757
- Stay out of it!
- What are you doing?

32:45.840 --> 32:47.216
Easy. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.344
God!

32:49.510 --> 32:50.511
You're right.

32:51.846 --> 32:52.930
I'm gonna...

32:56.851 --> 32:58.603
Don't you ever
touch her again!

32:59.270 --> 33:00.521
You hear me?

33:04.275 --> 33:06.194
You gotta go.
Mom, he's gotta go.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.573
He can't stay here.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.956
You okay?
Yeah.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.127
You sure
you've got everything?

33:30.677 --> 33:32.220
Just let her
talk to me.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.930
Get in the car, Dad.

33:41.187 --> 33:44.774
<i>From that moment on, Ethan
was the leader of our pack.</i>

33:45.817 --> 33:48.319
<i>When we went home,
things were different.</i>

33:49.404 --> 33:50.655
<i>Dad was gone.</i>

33:52.281 --> 33:54.826
<i>That cat had been
hiding from me for a while.</i>

33:56.494 --> 33:57.870
<i>And now, I got it.</i>

34:02.959 --> 34:04.377
<i>Found him!</i>

34:04.460 --> 34:05.878
<i>Okay, sorry.</i>

34:07.672 --> 34:08.672
Jeez!

34:08.755 --> 34:10.216
Go! Red-80.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.342
Red-80!

34:11.426 --> 34:12.426
Down!

34:12.467 --> 34:13.803
Set! Hut!

34:13.969 --> 34:16.389
That's it!
Over the top!

34:22.687 --> 34:23.980
Way to go, Ethan!

34:29.985 --> 34:31.112
Let's go!

34:31.862 --> 34:32.864
Let's go!

34:35.324 --> 34:37.201
Come on, Tigers!

34:37.284 --> 34:39.120
Down. Set. Hut!

34:52.300 --> 34:54.177
<i>Touchdown, Tigers!</i>

35:00.349 --> 35:01.476
Mom!

35:03.519 --> 35:04.520
No.

35:04.604 --> 35:06.397
Full scholarship.
Four years.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.733
Oh, my God! Really?

35:11.861 --> 35:13.321
Really?
Yeah.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.282
Okay, you wait here.
Okay, boss dog? <i>Okay.</i>

35:16.365 --> 35:18.010
You wait here,
I'll get you something to eat. Okay?

35:18.034 --> 35:19.952
<i>I just said okay.</i>
Good boy.

35:26.876 --> 35:28.920
Come on, baby! Let it burn!

35:29.003 --> 35:31.339
Go! Go, go, go, go! Yes!

35:32.048 --> 35:33.132
What?

35:36.552 --> 35:38.221
<i>I'm keeping watch.</i>

35:38.513 --> 35:39.806
<i>All clear.</i>

35:41.474 --> 35:42.475
<i>What?</i>

35:43.684 --> 35:46.437
<i>Uh-oh. What was
he doing here?</i>

35:47.230 --> 35:50.525
<i>And in one of his bad moods, too.
I could smell it.</i>

35:51.526 --> 35:52.568
Come on, let's go.

35:52.693 --> 35:54.533
- Come on.
- Got his brains from his mom, huh?

35:59.534 --> 36:00.660
Hey, Dad.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.578
Hey, pal.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.497
What are you doing here?

36:06.499 --> 36:09.502
I saw ya.
I saw ya tonight...

36:09.585 --> 36:11.379
And you did good.
You were at the game?

36:12.004 --> 36:13.089
Yeah.

36:13.256 --> 36:14.507
You got a good arm.

36:14.757 --> 36:17.260
So, everything's
going good? This guy?

36:17.718 --> 36:19.846
Good game, huh?
Dad. Hey, Dad.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.241
We're all excited for the big win, huh?
Let's hear it for this guy!

36:22.265 --> 36:23.492
You don't have to do
this right now, Dad.

36:23.516 --> 36:25.268
Come on! Come on!

36:25.518 --> 36:26.686
Would you stop this?

36:27.270 --> 36:29.272
All right.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.274
Come on.
Let's go.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.613
Want your burger?
For Bailey?

36:39.699 --> 36:41.826
Hey, boss dog. Good boy.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.705
So, it's not all perfect
in Ethan Land, huh.

36:46.414 --> 36:48.174
Now I know why you're
going to Michigan, man.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.376
Get away from that
alchy father of yours.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.962
You should shut up, Todd.
Oh, yeah?

36:53.045 --> 36:56.424
You don't want everyone here knowing
that your father's a drunk?

36:56.507 --> 36:58.009
Ethan, I have to
catch my bus. Please.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.385
It's pretty obvious.

36:59.468 --> 37:00.737
Can we go?
Yeah, we're going soon.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.306
Oh, and his girlfriend's
fighting his battles, too.

37:03.806 --> 37:05.600
If Michigan State
knew the real Ethan...

37:08.436 --> 37:10.104
I told you
to shut up, Todd.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.068
<i>I don't like
that smell.</i>

37:16.235 --> 37:17.395
Please get in the car.

37:18.154 --> 37:20.615
Bailey, come on! Bailey, let's go!
Get in the car!

37:29.165 --> 37:31.751
<i>What was that?
Could that be that squirrel?</i>

37:37.256 --> 37:38.507
Perfect.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.177
<i>Todd was on our territory.</i>

37:42.011 --> 37:43.804
<i>Oh, I wanted to bite him.</i>

37:44.513 --> 37:46.682
<i>But I remembered Ethan
telling me no biting.</i>

37:47.642 --> 37:48.684
<i>Then I forgot.</i>

37:49.977 --> 37:51.187
Hey!

37:52.897 --> 37:54.523
No, no, no.

38:01.364 --> 38:02.490
<i>Ethan.</i>

38:13.709 --> 38:14.961
Bailey, shut up.

38:21.717 --> 38:22.843
Mom!

38:23.678 --> 38:26.430
Mom, Mom, Mom! Get up. Get up.
Quick, quick.

38:26.514 --> 38:28.224
Come on! Quick!

38:30.142 --> 38:32.144
We've gotta get out.
We can't. We can't. Come.

38:32.228 --> 38:33.604
The window. Come here.

38:38.401 --> 38:39.652
Fire! Fire!

38:39.735 --> 38:40.903
You've gotta jump.

38:40.987 --> 38:43.030
It's too high.
Get your sheets! Get your sheets!

38:49.245 --> 38:51.080
I just wanna tie
these together.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.750
Anyone have
a ladder handy?

38:57.086 --> 38:58.587
We've gotta help 'em down.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.089
Oh, God.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.067
How many people
are in the house?

39:02.091 --> 39:03.092
Okay.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.455
Check the back
of the house!

39:10.766 --> 39:11.886
Somebody give me
a hand.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.269
Go, go, go!

39:15.521 --> 39:17.398
We got you. Got her.

39:17.481 --> 39:18.941
We've got you.
We've got you.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.280
Good boy. Good boy.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.161
I'll check
around back!

39:30.494 --> 39:32.121
I'm here,
right behind you.

39:34.749 --> 39:35.958
No!

39:38.252 --> 39:39.563
Is there anything
I can do?

39:41.756 --> 39:43.632
We gotta help him down.
Come on, Ethan.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.305
- You need to jump, son!
- Ethan.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.389
Jump!

39:55.394 --> 39:56.854
Ethan!

39:57.938 --> 39:59.273
Can you move?

39:59.356 --> 40:00.566
My leg!

40:06.113 --> 40:08.491
- My leg.
- You're gonna be all right.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.868
You're okay.

40:16.165 --> 40:17.416
Somebody hold this dog.

40:17.500 --> 40:18.751
Hey, Bailey. Bailey.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.669
No. No.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.256
Go with him.
Go with him. No!

40:24.840 --> 40:25.841
One, two, three.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.349
Let me give you
a hand with that.

40:34.016 --> 40:35.976
It's gonna be okay, boy.
He'll be back.

40:38.687 --> 40:39.772
Easy.

40:51.951 --> 40:54.870
No. Hey! Hey! Don't! Stop!

40:55.037 --> 40:56.077
Somebody get the dog.

40:57.373 --> 40:58.833
Hey, hey, hey.

41:00.084 --> 41:01.669
What you running from, son?

41:02.002 --> 41:04.088
I swear it was an accident.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.049
Why don't you tell
us what happened?

41:07.133 --> 41:08.634
I had a firework...

41:09.009 --> 41:10.889
I think
you should come with us.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.723
It was an accident.

41:18.144 --> 41:20.896
Fran, Fran! Come on, come on.
They're here. They're here.

41:23.399 --> 41:24.859
I'm being careful.

41:26.402 --> 41:29.071
Hey, sweetie.
Good to see you.

41:31.574 --> 41:34.410
Oh, look at you.
Here, here.

41:34.743 --> 41:35.995
I got it.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.080
Fran. Stop it. Stop.

41:39.248 --> 41:41.584
Good to see you, Ethan.
Yeah. You too.

41:45.713 --> 41:47.298
I've been
baking all day.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.025
Got your room
all set up for you, Ethan.

41:49.049 --> 41:50.509
It's so good
to have you here.

41:52.094 --> 41:54.180
<i>Ethan never
wanted to play anymore.</i>

41:54.597 --> 41:55.723
Oh, Bailey!

41:57.433 --> 41:59.810
<i>Even though he carried a great
new stick everywhere he went.</i>

42:01.061 --> 42:02.563
Bailey. Come on.

42:02.646 --> 42:04.398
- No, no, no.
- Bailey.

42:04.481 --> 42:05.816
Come on. Come on.

42:08.110 --> 42:09.945
<i>I couldn't make
him play with me.</i>

42:11.071 --> 42:12.656
<i>All he wanted to do
was sleep.</i>

42:18.120 --> 42:20.831
<i>I had a lot of free time now.
So, I made a new friend.</i>

42:22.458 --> 42:24.126
<i>It was like a small horse</i>

42:24.501 --> 42:26.003
<i>or a giant dog.</i>

42:26.712 --> 42:30.883
<i>With its own special smell,
that was so wonderful and disgusting.</i>

42:31.467 --> 42:33.302
<i>Oh, I wished
I could roll in it.</i>

42:38.891 --> 42:40.976
<i>Oh, we had fun.</i>

42:41.602 --> 42:43.062
<i>Until we didn't.</i>

42:46.690 --> 42:48.317
<i>At least Hannah
still came around.</i>

42:48.984 --> 42:49.985
Hey!

42:50.152 --> 42:51.195
Hey.

42:51.278 --> 42:54.490
Hi, Bailey! Hi!

42:55.449 --> 42:57.618
Hi! I missed you, too.

42:58.327 --> 43:00.663
Good boy! Good boy!

43:01.664 --> 43:04.959
You're such a good boy.
Come on! Come on!

43:05.042 --> 43:06.335
Hey.
Hey.

43:09.171 --> 43:10.923
Do you, um, do you
wanna go to the pond?

43:11.465 --> 43:13.008
I made some sandwiches.

43:13.884 --> 43:14.885
Yeah.

43:17.346 --> 43:18.639
Yeah, if you want.

43:18.722 --> 43:21.183
I just thought it'd be nice if
we could get out of the house.

43:21.642 --> 43:23.102
Get you out.

43:31.318 --> 43:32.528
What?

43:33.779 --> 43:36.365
Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try,
but you don't have to...

43:36.448 --> 43:38.528
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to help me.

43:41.870 --> 43:44.331
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for us.

43:44.415 --> 43:45.874
No, you're doing
this for me.

43:48.877 --> 43:50.713
You leave for college
in three weeks.

43:53.215 --> 43:55.801
But I'll be back all the time.
Uh-huh. And I'll be here.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.095
With that.

44:00.222 --> 44:02.016
You have to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

44:02.099 --> 44:03.559
You can't do this
for me, Hannah.

44:05.894 --> 44:07.062
I'd do anything for you.

44:07.146 --> 44:09.466
I don't think we should be with
each other anymore, Hannah.

44:12.401 --> 44:13.652
Whoa!

44:18.032 --> 44:19.616
We shouldn't be with
each other anymore.

44:22.077 --> 44:23.829
It's not gonna work.
I'm sorry.

44:26.874 --> 44:28.417
Why are you doing this?

44:46.435 --> 44:47.603
Bailey.

44:51.106 --> 44:52.441
Good boy.

44:54.109 --> 44:55.444
You want your ball?

44:55.611 --> 44:57.654
Okay, here's your ball.
Go on.

45:03.744 --> 45:06.205
Bye, Bailey.

45:21.637 --> 45:24.765
<i>Wait.
Wait, no. No, stay.</i>

45:31.438 --> 45:32.898
<i>I really missed Hannah.</i>

45:33.774 --> 45:34.983
<i>Ethan missed her, too.</i>

45:35.984 --> 45:37.236
<i>I could tell.</i>

45:39.238 --> 45:41.281
Ethan,
I made you a sandwich.

45:41.365 --> 45:43.075
I'm gonna put it
in the backseat, okay?

45:43.158 --> 45:44.958
All right, Fran.
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

45:45.661 --> 45:47.704
Good boy. You're gonna
miss me, huh?

45:48.956 --> 45:50.165
I'm gonna miss you, too.

45:51.333 --> 45:52.751
Don't look
so glum, women.

45:52.835 --> 45:54.503
It's a good
agricultural school.

45:55.170 --> 45:56.570
He's gonna learn
everything he needs

45:56.630 --> 45:57.881
to know about
running this farm.

45:58.966 --> 46:00.676
All right. Go on. Come on.

46:02.177 --> 46:03.929
Better grab him.
He's not gonna understand.

46:05.097 --> 46:06.849
Come here. Good boy.
You got the dog?

46:08.851 --> 46:10.936
- Come here. Stay, Bailey. Stay.
- Come on, boy.

46:26.869 --> 46:27.870
Whoa!

46:28.537 --> 46:29.705
Oh, my goodness.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.081
Good boy, Bailey.

46:31.206 --> 46:32.416
Keep that for me.
Okay, Bailey?

46:36.545 --> 46:38.046
- Bye, Ethan!
- Drive safe.

46:39.506 --> 46:40.883
See you, Ethan!

46:47.723 --> 46:49.933
No, Bailey. Stay.

46:50.017 --> 46:52.311
<i>Stay?
We're playing fetch!</i>

46:52.394 --> 46:53.770
Bailey!

46:53.854 --> 46:55.898
<i>It's been so long
since we've played.</i>

47:29.014 --> 47:30.182
Bailey?

47:37.022 --> 47:39.983
<i>I like this
new version of fetch.</i>

47:40.067 --> 47:41.777
You're crazy.
You know that, boss dog?

47:42.194 --> 47:45.072
<i>Maybe not
drive so far next time.</i>

47:50.244 --> 47:52.412
Take care of things around here for me.
Okay, boy?

47:53.747 --> 47:55.249
I'll be back soon.

47:55.332 --> 47:56.625
Promise.

48:01.088 --> 48:03.924
Come on.
Go on. Go home.

48:11.139 --> 48:15.477
<i>Humans are complicated.
They do things dogs can't understand.</i>

48:16.144 --> 48:17.729
<i>Like leave.</i>

48:20.107 --> 48:23.819
<i>Ethan and I were meant to be together.
But if there was no Ethan,</i>

48:24.403 --> 48:26.446
<i>what was the point
of my being here?</i>

48:27.990 --> 48:31.326
<i>Maybe the point was
not to look for a point.</i>

48:32.661 --> 48:34.329
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

48:35.581 --> 48:37.833
Okay. I'll be
right back, Bailey.

48:39.001 --> 48:41.169
<i>Everything moved at
a slower pace now.</i>

48:42.838 --> 48:44.256
<i>Which was okay.</i>

48:44.339 --> 48:46.466
<i>Because I never felt
like running anymore.</i>

48:49.011 --> 48:50.679
<i>I was tired all the time.</i>

48:54.349 --> 48:56.101
<i>I didn't feel like
playing anymore.</i>

48:58.312 --> 49:00.147
<i>Not even with horse-dog.</i>

49:04.526 --> 49:05.944
Hey, Bailey.

49:10.490 --> 49:11.783
Are you okay, boy?

49:14.786 --> 49:16.121
Bill.

49:18.457 --> 49:19.625
Careful.

49:22.377 --> 49:23.962
Let's see
what we have here.

49:24.379 --> 49:28.216
His eyes just didn't look right.
They were kind of rheumy.

49:28.634 --> 49:32.137
And he was panting.
His breathing was labored.

49:32.220 --> 49:34.973
He's also got this
little lump in his...

49:35.057 --> 49:37.601
Oh, yeah. Has he been drinking
a lot of water and peeing?

49:37.684 --> 49:38.685
No.

49:38.769 --> 49:41.480
Lethargic. So he doesn't
wanna go for walks anymore?

49:41.563 --> 49:43.148
I had to carry
him into the car.

49:43.231 --> 49:45.651
What can we do for him, doctor?
What do you think?

49:45.734 --> 49:50.322
We could do testing,
but I'm afraid that it would

49:50.405 --> 49:52.407
probably be the same results.

49:54.242 --> 49:55.911
His kidneys
are shutting down.

49:55.994 --> 49:57.579
<i>Everyone was so sad.</i>

49:58.372 --> 50:00.457
<i>But I was too tired
to cheer them up.</i>

50:01.083 --> 50:03.168
Dr. Joyce, can I
use your phone?

50:03.251 --> 50:04.586
Yes, absolutely.
Doctor...

50:05.128 --> 50:06.713
If this was a person...

50:07.255 --> 50:08.715
You're the veterinarian.

50:17.599 --> 50:18.934
Uh, hello.

50:19.101 --> 50:22.396
Yeah, I'm looking for Ethan.
It's his grandpa, Bill.

50:24.564 --> 50:25.899
Ethan! It's Grandpa.

50:25.982 --> 50:27.275
<i>Ethan?</i>

50:27.984 --> 50:29.403
<i>Are you here?</i>

50:30.612 --> 50:31.988
<i>I can't smell you.</i>

50:34.616 --> 50:36.118
<i>Where are you?</i>

50:41.957 --> 50:43.375
<i>Hey, Bailey.</i>

50:46.294 --> 50:47.587
<i>There he was.</i>

50:48.964 --> 50:50.757
<i>I could tell
he was still sad.</i>

50:51.842 --> 50:53.969
<i>I didn't want him
to be sad.</i>

50:54.386 --> 50:55.721
Doodle dog.

50:56.179 --> 50:57.556
Boss dog.

50:59.933 --> 51:03.061
<i>I knew I was here to love
Ethan and make him happy.</i>

51:05.480 --> 51:07.691
Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey.

51:09.609 --> 51:11.653
<i>I didn't want to
leave him like this.</i>

51:15.407 --> 51:16.658
Good boy.

51:17.325 --> 51:18.535
Good boy, Bailey.

51:19.661 --> 51:23.707
Don't worry.
He'll just feel a little prick in his neck.

51:24.499 --> 51:26.293
And then the pain
will go away.

51:40.599 --> 51:42.225
<i>And then it happened again.</i>

51:42.559 --> 51:45.353
<i>The mother,
the milk, the tongue,</i>

51:45.687 --> 51:47.522
<i>the warmth, I was back.</i>

51:49.024 --> 51:51.193
<i>But why? Where was Ethan?</i>

51:51.860 --> 51:53.528
<i>Other things
were missing, too.</i>

51:54.362 --> 51:55.572
<i>I didn't have a...</i>

51:56.198 --> 51:57.699
<i>What? I'm a girl?</i>

51:59.201 --> 52:00.410
Come on. Come on.

52:00.494 --> 52:02.204
Good girl. Good girl.

52:02.287 --> 52:03.580
<i>My man was very serious.</i>

52:03.663 --> 52:04.915
Look!

52:05.540 --> 52:08.084
<i>We worked hard.</i>
Over. Over. Good girl!

52:08.168 --> 52:09.961
<i>Even when we played,</i>

52:10.045 --> 52:12.005
<i>he made it feel like work.</i>
Easy.

52:12.088 --> 52:13.632
Down, down.

52:13.715 --> 52:16.051
Find Wally. Search! Go!

52:21.973 --> 52:23.892
<i>Wally was a disaster,</i>

52:23.975 --> 52:26.019
<i>always losing
pieces of clothing.</i>

52:29.189 --> 52:30.982
You found him.

52:31.066 --> 52:33.819
Good job. Okay. Okay.

52:38.406 --> 52:40.158
<i>Carlos Ruiz.</i>

52:40.909 --> 52:42.410
<i>So, this is my purpose?</i>

52:43.745 --> 52:45.205
<i>It's not about fun.</i>

52:45.455 --> 52:47.582
<i>It's not about Ethan.</i>
Come on. Come on.

52:47.874 --> 52:50.752
<i>My job is to seek, find,</i>

52:51.253 --> 52:52.587
<i>and show.</i>

52:57.050 --> 52:58.927
Good job. Good job.

53:01.304 --> 53:03.014
<i>But even when I did
a good job,</i>

53:03.390 --> 53:05.100
<i>my man was still sad.</i>

53:09.563 --> 53:11.022
<i>He was lonely.</i>

53:11.356 --> 53:15.235
<i>I could smell someone else used to
live here, but their scent was faint.</i>

53:15.318 --> 53:17.237
<i>They hadn't been
around in a long time.</i>

53:18.905 --> 53:20.323
<i>That's when I realized</i>

53:20.949 --> 53:24.703
<i>being alone might be the worst
thing that could happen to you.</i>

53:28.582 --> 53:30.458
<i>I knew how it felt
to miss someone.</i>

53:32.919 --> 53:34.588
<i>Did he miss someone, too?</i>

53:44.389 --> 53:45.390
Stop that.

53:45.473 --> 53:46.474
Hey!

53:46.850 --> 53:49.019
<i>What?</i>

53:49.352 --> 53:50.979
Dog bed. Now.

53:53.231 --> 53:55.358
Ellie...

53:56.318 --> 53:58.320
Dog bed. Now.

54:02.032 --> 54:03.742
<i>Why did I
listen to him?</i>

54:04.743 --> 54:06.036
<i>I didn't wanna go.</i>

54:06.953 --> 54:09.122
<i>And I could tell he didn't
want me to go either.</i>

54:12.542 --> 54:14.502
Oh, gosh!

54:17.380 --> 54:19.424
Would you give me a break?

54:31.686 --> 54:33.521
No whining.

54:46.284 --> 54:47.285
Gun.

54:48.745 --> 54:50.914
<i>Gun had a smell
that stung my nose.</i>

54:51.623 --> 54:52.874
Steady.

54:53.208 --> 54:54.334
Stay.

54:55.001 --> 54:56.336
Relax.

54:57.629 --> 54:59.089
Get used to it.

55:01.216 --> 55:02.676
Stay strong.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.308
Good girl.

55:20.610 --> 55:21.945
Yes?

55:26.908 --> 55:28.326
What?

55:36.751 --> 55:38.503
I could do that, too.

55:48.722 --> 55:50.473
I mean,
I don't see why not.

55:51.766 --> 55:53.059
Come on.

55:53.226 --> 55:54.352
Come on.

56:05.071 --> 56:07.532
That's the sweater that she
was wearing yesterday.

56:08.658 --> 56:11.536
Today she had on blue jeans
and a blue jacket.

56:12.287 --> 56:13.997
We got called
here on a domestic.

56:14.080 --> 56:16.249
By the time we got here,
it was kidnapping.

56:16.332 --> 56:19.544
Ex-boyfriend, armed.
Took the 12-year-old girl.

56:19.627 --> 56:20.628
What is this?

56:20.712 --> 56:22.672
This is the last item of
clothing she was wearing.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.592
Come on. Come on.

56:34.809 --> 56:36.037
<i>Got a
partial plate called in</i>

56:36.061 --> 56:38.730
<i>on a blue Toyota heading
east toward the reservoir.</i>

56:38.813 --> 56:40.565
Copy that.
We're on our way.

56:44.903 --> 56:46.029
Ellie.

56:46.112 --> 56:47.113
Ellie.

56:47.197 --> 56:48.239
Find.

56:49.824 --> 56:52.452
Find, Ellie. Good girl.

56:52.535 --> 56:53.787
Good find.

56:53.870 --> 56:56.164
<i>Pretzel.
Pizza. Hot dog.</i>

56:56.247 --> 56:58.291
<i>Rubber. Train. Cab.</i>

56:58.374 --> 57:00.668
<i>Coffee. Sweater.
Girl. Sweater girl!</i>

57:00.752 --> 57:01.961
<i>Girl! Girl!</i>

57:13.389 --> 57:14.682
Come on.

57:26.486 --> 57:28.655
Come on. Come on.

57:33.368 --> 57:34.661
That a girl.

57:34.744 --> 57:36.329
Get him! Get him!

57:36.412 --> 57:37.664
Halt!

57:37.747 --> 57:39.249
Police!

57:39.332 --> 57:40.667
Halt!

57:40.750 --> 57:42.710
Get him, girl. Get him!

57:42.794 --> 57:44.546
Get him, Ellie.

57:44.629 --> 57:46.005
I said halt!

57:48.424 --> 57:51.010
Slowly! Let her go!

58:12.282 --> 58:14.826
Hold it! Hold it!

58:15.160 --> 58:16.327
Stop!

58:20.623 --> 58:21.666
Hey!

58:32.468 --> 58:33.761
Halt!

59:06.669 --> 59:08.171
We've got you.
We've got you.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.347
- Good girl.
- There you go.

59:41.829 --> 59:42.830
Release!

59:52.632 --> 59:53.925
We got him. We got him.

59:54.008 --> 59:55.134
Get up.

59:55.218 --> 59:56.761
Come on. Get up.

59:56.844 --> 59:58.012
Come on.

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:07.313
This is canine unit K 27.
I'm gonna need immediate

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:10.316
assistance.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.151
My dog's been shot.

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:15.405
I repeat, canine shot.

01:00:18.491 --> 01:00:20.410
<i>I always
hated getting shots.</i>

01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:24.038
<i>This was definitely
the worst shot I ever got.</i>

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:25.415
Ellie.

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:27.333
You're gonna be okay.

01:00:29.127 --> 01:00:30.628
You're gonna be okay.

01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:36.634
You're a good dog.

01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:40.596
<i>I could tell from Carlos'
voice I'd done a good job.</i>

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:46.060
You're a good dog.

01:00:55.278 --> 01:00:56.904
<i>I need to rest.</i>

01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:00.116
<i>Can I just
sleep in your bed?</i>

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.923
<i>That was a different life.</i>

01:01:17.175 --> 01:01:19.010
<i>Not so much fun, really.</i>

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.263
<i>But I did good work.</i>

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:25.725
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:30.271
<i>Now I'm tiny,
and all ears!</i>

01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:32.857
Oh! Hi, you.

01:01:33.358 --> 01:01:35.526
Are you the cutest
little puppy in the world?

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:37.278
<i>She smelled good.</i>

01:01:37.362 --> 01:01:39.030
<i>Like sunshine and pretzels.</i>

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:40.198
I think you are.

01:01:40.365 --> 01:01:43.409
Oh, yeah. You wanna
come home with me, huh?

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:47.789
Okay, you gotta
come home with me.

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:49.290
You gotta come
home with me, huh?

01:01:54.462 --> 01:01:55.671
You gonna help me with this?

01:01:56.672 --> 01:01:59.759
What's happening?
Where are you going? Come here.

01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:02.136
What's going on?
What's going on, huh?

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:11.729
<i>I could tell she was sad.</i>

01:02:12.397 --> 01:02:14.315
<i>I needed to cheer her up.</i>

01:02:20.405 --> 01:02:21.781
What are you doing?

01:02:22.115 --> 01:02:25.076
<i>Where's my tail?
Hello? Where's my tail?</i>

01:02:27.537 --> 01:02:30.498
Okay, boy. All right. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:34.043
<i>Everywhere she went,
Maya brought me along.</i>

01:02:34.127 --> 01:02:35.586
<i>Which was great!</i>

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.923
<i>According to the American
philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce...</i>

01:02:40.508 --> 01:02:42.343
<i>She always brought me
something to eat.</i>

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:44.769
<i>I almost forgot what it
was like to be hungry.</i>

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.223
<i>Well, almost.</i>

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.017
Hey.

01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:51.519
Hi.
Hi.

01:02:52.562 --> 01:02:53.604
Cute dog.

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:54.772
Uh-huh. Thanks.

01:02:55.273 --> 01:02:58.985
Listen, a few of us are putting
together a study group.

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:00.629
We're meeting at
the Woodford common room.

01:03:00.653 --> 01:03:02.071
We'd love for you
to join us.

01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:03.573
Um...

01:03:03.656 --> 01:03:05.241
I would,

01:03:05.408 --> 01:03:06.826
but I have plans, so...

01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:10.788
Oh, but I didn't say
when we was meeting.

01:03:12.498 --> 01:03:14.000
No, I'm busy.

01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:17.253
I know I'm gonna be busy.
I got my dog, so I gotta...

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.463
Thank you.

01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:20.357
I gotta go. I'm sorry.
I have to take my dog out.

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:21.674
Okay.
But thank you!

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:23.217
Okay.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.094
Maybe next time.

01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:26.429
Uh, yeah!

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:28.806
I don't know what's
wrong with me, Tino.

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.766
Maybe it would be nice
to meet people, but...

01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:33.186
No. Also I should
just study alone.

01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:36.564
<i>Slow down! Slow down!
My legs are barely even legs.</i>

01:03:37.023 --> 01:03:38.357
I feel like such an idiot.

01:03:38.441 --> 01:03:40.801
<i>I learned quickly that even
though Maya talked all the time,</i>

01:03:41.319 --> 01:03:42.904
<i>she was a lot like Carlos.</i>

01:03:43.696 --> 01:03:46.824
<i>There was no one else in our pack.
Just Maya and me.</i>

01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:49.577
<i>But I'm starting to get her.</i>

01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:51.954
<i>Actually,
I can read her mind.</i>

01:03:52.121 --> 01:03:53.581
You know what I'm thinking?

01:03:54.165 --> 01:03:56.042
<i>Chips.</i>
Chips.

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:02.215
You know what I'm thinking?

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:04.258
<i>Pizza!</i>
Pizza.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.553
<i>Please. Pizza.</i>

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:09.096
Hey, Chris.
Hi.

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.141
Bye.

01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:14.268
You ready?
<i>I am ready.</i>

01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:17.772
You know what I'm thinking?

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:18.856
<i>Ice cream!</i>

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.650
It's ridiculous,

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:22.961
but sometimes I actually think
you know what I'm thinking.

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:24.695
<i>Ice cream,
ice cream, ice cream.</i>

01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:26.739
Ugh! Tino, I'm spending
way too much time alone.

01:04:27.657 --> 01:04:28.897
You wanna go get
some ice cream?

01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:30.743
<i>You've read my mind.</i>

01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:35.289
I think this is it, Tino.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.252
I think it's just
gonna be you and me.

01:04:41.963 --> 01:04:43.881
I don't know.
That's fine, right? Because

01:04:44.966 --> 01:04:48.803
I love you, and you love me
and love is all that matters.

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.974
It's not like it matters
where you get your love.

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:57.103
As long as something
loves you, right?

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:58.479
<i>Can I have some more?</i>

01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:05.152
Oh, you're so sweet.

01:05:08.406 --> 01:05:11.826
You're so cute.
Hi! I love you.

01:05:12.994 --> 01:05:14.954
Why can't you be
my boyfriend, huh?

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:17.540
<i>Why can't you give me
more ice cream?</i>

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:21.168
One more to go.

01:05:21.252 --> 01:05:24.092
<i>What's with these white coat
people sticking me with sharp things?</i>

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.673
Now, do you feed him
at regular times?

01:05:26.716 --> 01:05:28.175
Pretty regular.

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:29.594
What do you give him?

01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:31.846
Food. Dog food. What?

01:05:32.847 --> 01:05:34.348
Maybe give him
more exercise.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:36.976
Go on more walks.
Sure.

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:40.104
<i>Shots. I hate those shots.</i>

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.525
Okay, Tino. Let's do this, huh?
Doctor's orders. Come here.

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.611
All right,
get the ball.

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:49.697
<i>A long walk, and
now I have to chase a ball?</i>

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.115
Get the ball. Come on!

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:53.034
<i>Why was I being
punished like this?</i>

01:05:53.117 --> 01:05:55.578
Tino, come on. You're a dog.
Chase the ball. Chase it.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:56.787
Come on, Tino.

01:05:56.871 --> 01:05:58.080
<i>Lucky.</i>

01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:00.249
Tino, this is
embarrassing, okay?

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.084
<i>Sorry. Not today.</i>

01:06:02.168 --> 01:06:03.544
Get the ball.
<i>I'm not in the mood.</i>

01:06:04.045 --> 01:06:05.630
<i>And then I saw her.</i>

01:06:07.298 --> 01:06:08.924
<i>And everything changed.</i>

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:12.803
<i>My heart was aflutter.</i>

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:16.349
<i>Wow.</i>

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:21.020
<i>What a catch!</i>

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.195
Tino!
Bring it back to me.

01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:36.410
<i>Are you feeling
what I'm feeling?</i>

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:38.704
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:41.082
My dog's acting so weird today.
No, it's okay.

01:06:42.083 --> 01:06:43.501
Come on, are you
gonna chase this?

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:44.877
Hey!

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:46.629
Wait a minute.
Oh, hey.

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:49.465
You and I both
have Professor Kenter.

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:51.801
Right. Yeah, yeah.
Wow.

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:55.971
I'm Al.
Oh, okay, I'm Maya.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.473
I'm sorry.

01:06:57.807 --> 01:07:00.017
<i>Maya was talking,
but I didn't listen.</i>

01:07:00.726 --> 01:07:02.144
<i>All I could think of
was her.</i>

01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:04.438
It's cool. I understand.

01:07:08.192 --> 01:07:09.318
<i>Why fight it?</i>

01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:11.320
<i>We smell great together.</i>

01:07:16.951 --> 01:07:19.203
<i>We started seeing
Roxy all the time.</i>

01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:22.248
<i>For some reason,
Al always came, too.</i>

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:25.292
<i>It wasn't long before</i>

01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:27.128
<i>we slept together.</i>

01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:34.051
<i>I'm really
starting to get it now.</i>

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.303
<i>If there's a point,</i>

01:07:36.721 --> 01:07:38.389
<i>Roxy is the point.</i>

01:07:40.474 --> 01:07:42.059
<i>Wait. What's going on?</i>

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:44.311
Um...

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:46.105
Maya?

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:48.500
There's been something
on my mind that

01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:50.044
I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:53.070
<i>Oh, I recognize
that sweaty smell.</i>

01:07:53.154 --> 01:07:56.615
We been together
for a while now, and, um...

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.582
Maya, I want you
to be my wife.

01:08:04.665 --> 01:08:06.500
Al! Oh, my God! Yes!

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:08.586
<i>Something's wrong here.
Maya's in trouble.</i>

01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:11.714
Oh, yes!

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:13.549
<i>There is danger.</i>

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:16.010
<i>Get behind me, Roxy.
I'll protect us all!</i>

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:17.178
Whoa!

01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:18.888
Al!

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.390
Okay. I got Tino.
I got Tino. I got Tino.

01:08:21.474 --> 01:08:22.725
Hold on!

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.894
Wait. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

01:08:24.977 --> 01:08:26.645
No, Roxy. Stop it!

01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:27.938
Okay.

01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:29.689
Mom, hold these.

01:08:29.774 --> 01:08:31.776
Come here. Come on.
Come here.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.861
Okay, I think we ready.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.237
Okay, perfect.

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:36.863
Okay.
Ready.

01:08:38.908 --> 01:08:41.035
<i>You're jealous because
Fallon's had her baby</i>

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:43.078
<i>and that's made you
even more paranoid.</i>

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.747
Okay, Alexis gonna get her
butt whooped... Right.

01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.267
...she keep running
off the mouth like that.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:49.251
'Cause Krystle's not gonna
take much more of this.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.670
This is crazy.

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:53.380
I told you. I told you.

01:08:53.464 --> 01:08:54.881
Oh, my gosh.

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:56.550
Oh, get her, Krystle.

01:08:57.218 --> 01:08:58.426
Oh, my gosh.

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:00.888
<i>What's all that
noise in her stomach?</i>

01:09:01.889 --> 01:09:03.474
<i>Was it something she ate?</i>

01:09:04.934 --> 01:09:06.727
Yo, they trying
to kill each other.

01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:09.395
Oh!
What?

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:12.024
<i>Oh, no.</i>

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.693
<i>It was a baby.</i>

01:09:14.777 --> 01:09:15.986
Is she breathing?

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.613
You've gotta relax, honey.
She's breathing, okay?

01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:20.926
Maybe we should wake
her up, just to be sure.

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:23.202
<i>I didn't understand
why they got a baby.</i>

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:24.828
<i>It took all their attention.</i>

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:27.872
<i>Good thing Roxy and I already
had everything we needed.</i>

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.792
<i>Each other.</i>

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:32.086
Hey, baby.

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:33.769
<i>Then they went
and got more babies.</i>

01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:36.048
<i>Seemed like
a mistake to me.</i>

01:09:37.049 --> 01:09:39.218
<i>Soon I had to live
my life on the run.</i>

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.053
Found him!

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.346
<i>There was no escape.</i>

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:47.893
<i>I let them do
what they wanted to me.</i>

01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:52.857
<i>I'd do anything so that
Roxy could be safe.</i>

01:09:54.066 --> 01:09:57.111
<i>That was my mission,
to protect her at all times.</i>

01:10:02.116 --> 01:10:05.494
<i>I guess if I was really honest,
I liked all the attention.</i>

01:10:09.957 --> 01:10:10.958
Bam!

01:10:15.087 --> 01:10:16.922
<i>As Roxy and I got older,</i>

01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:19.049
<i>our connection grew stronger.</i>

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:23.178
<i>And she never
lost the spark</i>

01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:25.681
<i>that drew me to her
in the first place.</i>

01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:30.102
<i>One day,
Roxy went to the vet.</i>

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:33.689
<i>And she never came back.</i>

01:10:38.444 --> 01:10:39.486
Look at me!
Look at me!

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:40.905
<i>Everyone was good to me.</i>

01:10:41.906 --> 01:10:43.699
<i>But as the years went by,</i>

01:10:44.575 --> 01:10:45.951
<i>I missed Roxy.</i>

01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.621
<i>It just wasn't
the same without her.</i>

01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:02.843
Hey, Tino.

01:11:10.351 --> 01:11:11.352
Tino.

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:14.855
You know what I'm thinking?

01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:17.524
<i>Yes. I know
what you're thinking.</i>

01:11:18.192 --> 01:11:19.360
Pizza.

01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:24.031
No?

01:11:25.616 --> 01:11:26.784
No pizza?

01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:28.410
<i>I'm not hungry.</i>

01:11:30.621 --> 01:11:32.039
Okay.

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:35.584
Tino.

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:39.254
What are you thinking?

01:11:40.965 --> 01:11:41.966
Hmm?

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:49.682
What are you thinking?

01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:54.478
Tino,
what are you thinking?

01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:56.230
<i>I'm thinking
I'm ready.</i>

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.733
<i>One of my best lives,
really.</i>

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:14.873
<i>I'm back. Again.</i>

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.751
<i>But why?</i>

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:24.216
Puppies!
Want a puppy?

01:12:24.925 --> 01:12:26.385
Puppies for sale!

01:12:26.635 --> 01:12:28.137
Who wants a puppy?

01:12:29.054 --> 01:12:30.389
Hi!

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.268
<i>Here we go again.</i>

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:36.270
Look what I got!

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:37.604
Yeah, I am looking.

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:39.356
Look how cute he is.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.817
You know, it's crazy.
Who's gonna take care of him?

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:43.777
I will.

01:12:43.861 --> 01:12:45.529
Come on.
I named him Waffles.

01:12:45.612 --> 01:12:47.114
Not inside.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:07.259
Come on.

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:13.755
I kept telling her
you were going to get bigger.

01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:16.310
Not so into you now,
is she?

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.313
<i>I never went anywhere.</i>

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:21.732
<i>I never played.</i>

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:25.486
<i>It was like the days
went on and on without me.</i>

01:13:27.738 --> 01:13:29.239
You have 30 days
to deal with this.

01:13:29.323 --> 01:13:30.407
<i>When the officer came,</i>

01:13:30.491 --> 01:13:31.676
<i>I thought it was
to take me to do</i>

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.826
<i>find and show.</i>

01:13:33.744 --> 01:13:35.204
<i>But she left without me.</i>

01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:37.664
He's dirty.
We're getting rid of him.

01:13:37.748 --> 01:13:38.749
We are not.

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:41.251
- That's enough!
- That dog! I took him in here.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.516
You'll make sure he finds
a nice home, right?

01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:57.434
Somebody responsible?

01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:58.811
Yeah.

01:14:09.113 --> 01:14:10.197
Come on. Out.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.573
Move it.

01:14:11.657 --> 01:14:12.950
Let's go. Come on.

01:14:13.534 --> 01:14:14.952
Move.

01:14:22.084 --> 01:14:23.919
So long, doggie.

01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:35.764
<i>Now I'm supposed
to walk home?</i>

01:14:36.348 --> 01:14:38.100
<i>That didn't seem very fair.</i>

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:40.727
<i>But when I thought about it,</i>

01:14:41.436 --> 01:14:43.730
<i>I didn't wanna
go back to that home.</i>

01:14:54.366 --> 01:14:55.659
Look, Mom.

01:14:56.118 --> 01:14:57.536
<i>That looks like fun.</i>

01:14:58.203 --> 01:14:59.621
Go get 'em.
There he is.

01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:02.166
<i>It's been so long
since I've had fun.</i>

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:04.607
Do you
wanna bring your dog?

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:06.188
Oh, yeah.
That would be great.

01:15:08.839 --> 01:15:10.090
<i>Do I know you?</i>

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:12.759
<i>There's something about you.</i>

01:15:14.094 --> 01:15:15.179
<i>It's</i>

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:16.388
<i>your smell.</i>

01:15:17.431 --> 01:15:18.974
Aw, you're a scruffy one.

01:15:19.516 --> 01:15:20.851
Are you lost?

01:15:21.268 --> 01:15:22.728
Where are you from?

01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:25.772
You got a collar?

01:15:26.732 --> 01:15:28.525
<i>I know that smell.</i>

01:15:29.234 --> 01:15:30.611
Don't be afraid.

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:32.404
<i>It's</i>

01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:33.906
<i>from a long time ago.</i>

01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:07.648
<i>Had I been
here before?</i>

01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:11.568
<i>I was so happy to
leave the town behind.</i>

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:17.491
<i>My nose was full
of fresh new smells.</i>

01:16:19.534 --> 01:16:20.786
<i>And then</i>

01:16:20.869 --> 01:16:23.080
<i>there are the smells
you never forget.</i>

01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:27.501
<i>Train. Moss. Trees.</i>

01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:29.461
<i>Horse. Garbage.</i>

01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:30.963
<i>It was horse-dog!</i>

01:16:59.283 --> 01:17:00.826
<i>Could it be the same?</i>

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:03.954
<i>Oh, it was the same.</i>

01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:06.790
<i>Could it mean
Ethan was here, too?</i>

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:11.753
<i>Ethan?</i>

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.382
<i>That can't be him.</i>

01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:19.553
<i>Is that him?</i>

01:17:22.222 --> 01:17:23.473
<i>It is him.</i>

01:17:24.224 --> 01:17:25.726
<i>It's him! Yes!</i>

01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:27.185
<i>Yes, it's him!</i>

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:32.274
Hey, hey, hey!

01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:34.276
<i>It's me!</i>

01:17:34.359 --> 01:17:36.611
<i>Boss dog! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.</i>

01:17:36.695 --> 01:17:37.904
<i>Doodle dog!</i>

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:39.740
Where'd you come from?

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.868
<i>After all these lives,
I'd actually found him!</i>

01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:44.369
<i>I found Ethan!</i>

01:17:47.164 --> 01:17:48.957
I'm gonna make
a bet you're hungry.

01:17:51.251 --> 01:17:52.586
Here ya go.

01:17:55.422 --> 01:17:56.715
Wow,

01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:59.343
you must be.
Nobody likes my cooking.

01:18:09.478 --> 01:18:11.271
Don't look at me
like that.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.733
You can't stay here.

01:18:16.068 --> 01:18:18.070
You gotta go home.
You belong to somebody.

01:18:18.612 --> 01:18:20.906
<i>Home! Yes! Yes, I'm home!</i>

01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:24.076
Go home, dog.

01:18:28.789 --> 01:18:29.956
Go home.

01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:46.890
You're a stubborn one,
aren't ya?

01:18:54.481 --> 01:18:57.692
<i>Then Tuesday night we got
three-tenths of an inch of rain.</i>

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:11.581
Be sure he gets
a good home.

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.333
He's a good dog.

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:14.626
Sure.

01:19:15.252 --> 01:19:16.920
<i>No!
No, don't leave me here.</i>

01:19:17.963 --> 01:19:19.381
<i>This is a white-coat place.</i>

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:21.341
<i>I belong with you.</i>

01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:25.512
So long, dog.

01:20:13.185 --> 01:20:14.728
You wanna get outta here?

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:20.400
Do you wanna go?
Come on, let's go.

01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:23.987
<i>I was back
in the front seat.</i>

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:26.490
Okay, buddy.

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.367
Guess it's gonna be
you and me.

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:31.661
And the donkey.

01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:34.331
<i>What's a donkey?</i>

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:38.335
Now, when was the last time
you got a bath?

01:20:39.586 --> 01:20:41.087
That's a good boy.

01:20:42.172 --> 01:20:44.090
There you go. All right.

01:20:44.424 --> 01:20:46.092
Just step out.
Out. Let's go.

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.356
You're getting
a new collar.

01:21:00.315 --> 01:21:01.441
Yeah!

01:21:01.983 --> 01:21:04.569
Doesn't look like he's missed too
many meals. He's in good shape.

01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:06.488
Yeah, he's a good boy.
Aren't you?

01:21:12.619 --> 01:21:14.538
<i>But Ethan
still seemed sad.</i>

01:21:15.956 --> 01:21:18.375
<i>Maybe it was because
he slept alone.</i>

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.629
<i>I wanted to help him,
but I didn't know how.</i>

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:26.424
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:28.468
<i>Hold that thought.</i>

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.266
<i>Okay, Bailey. Let's do this.</i>

01:21:34.349 --> 01:21:36.726
<i>Hurry. Hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry.</i>

01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:39.521
<i>This is the place.</i>

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:41.565
<i>I'm looking for...</i>

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:46.236
Come on, Carly.

01:21:46.319 --> 01:21:48.655
Come here, girl.
Come on, Carly.

01:21:49.155 --> 01:21:50.490
Come here, Carly.

01:21:51.241 --> 01:21:53.410
- Can you get the gate for me?
- Yes, Mommy.

01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:57.664
Good girl.

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:05.672
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

01:22:07.507 --> 01:22:09.759
- Rach!
- Oh, hey!

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.596
Look, Will.
Grandma's here.

01:22:12.679 --> 01:22:14.306
<i>There's that smell again.</i>

01:22:14.681 --> 01:22:16.182
I'm pretty good.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.310
This is a surprise.

01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:20.395
<i>It's stronger now.</i>

01:22:21.187 --> 01:22:22.355
I got you some groceries.

01:22:22.439 --> 01:22:23.523
<i>It's Hannah!</i>

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:26.026
<i>You're still here?</i>

01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:28.278
<i>Oh, you look different.</i>

01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:30.822
<i>But you still
smell like biscuits.</i>

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.369
Who is this?

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:39.623
It's the stray
from the park.

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:42.709
A stray? Really?

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:45.795
Well...

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:46.963
Hello there.

01:22:48.048 --> 01:22:49.549
What a good dog.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.427
Well, he's certainly
not a stray

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:54.304
'cause he's got a collar.
Let's see.

01:22:55.096 --> 01:22:56.640
His name is Buddy.

01:22:57.557 --> 01:22:59.309
Let's see.
He belongs to...

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:10.505
<i>Come on, Ethan.
I can smell you in there.</i>

01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:13.508
I don't wanna
leave you here.

01:24:14.968 --> 01:24:16.261
But I guess he's not home.

01:24:35.697 --> 01:24:37.157
Hi, Ethan.

01:24:39.492 --> 01:24:40.785
Hi, Hannah.

01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:46.708
I brought your dog home.

01:24:56.426 --> 01:24:57.886
Must have been
tough on you,

01:24:57.969 --> 01:24:59.679
losing your husband
after all those years.

01:25:00.722 --> 01:25:03.057
Yeah, it made me
miss my daughter a lot.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.394
And then with
the new baby coming,

01:25:06.478 --> 01:25:10.315
I thought Rachel and Miguel
could really use the help.

01:25:10.899 --> 01:25:12.192
Yeah.

01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:13.693
How long you
get to stay for?

01:25:14.778 --> 01:25:16.029
Uh...

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.031
Well, I'm not visiting,
Ethan.

01:25:18.114 --> 01:25:20.033
I moved back
about a month ago.

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:22.494
You did?

01:25:23.369 --> 01:25:24.913
Welcome home.

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:27.373
Thanks.

01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:33.379
Well, this place
is still the same.

01:25:33.922 --> 01:25:35.924
- Yeah.
<i>- Oh, come on!</i>

01:25:37.175 --> 01:25:41.012
So, what about you?
You never met anyone? Or...

01:25:41.513 --> 01:25:43.181
Never found the right fit.

01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:44.724
Mmm-hmm.

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.352
I'm really stubborn.

01:25:47.435 --> 01:25:49.145
I know that.

01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:51.689
When you put your mind to
something, that was that.

01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:54.275
Yeah.

01:25:54.359 --> 01:25:55.985
That's good for
getting things done.

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:57.654
It's not so good
for relationships.

01:26:00.365 --> 01:26:01.991
Okay, well...

01:26:03.034 --> 01:26:05.203
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

01:26:05.286 --> 01:26:06.746
<i>They're gonna lick faces.</i>

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.164
Well, look...

01:26:08.248 --> 01:26:10.750
This was really nice.
I gotta go.

01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:12.752
Thank you, Ethan.

01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:16.130
<i>Wait, what?
Oh, come on!</i>

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:18.466
Hey, thanks for
bringing back my dog.

01:26:18.842 --> 01:26:20.552
You're welcome. Bye.

01:26:23.513 --> 01:26:24.806
Hey, Hannah.

01:26:28.977 --> 01:26:30.228
I, um...

01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:33.773
I owe you an apology.

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:36.317
For what happened to us.

01:26:36.985 --> 01:26:38.361
Back then.

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:42.365
Well, don't worry.
It was a long, long time ago.

01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:44.409
No, I pushed you away.

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:47.579
And I was really
mad at the world.

01:26:47.662 --> 01:26:50.790
And I just want you to know
that not a day goes by that

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.126
I don't kick myself

01:26:54.627 --> 01:26:55.962
for doing that.

01:26:56.713 --> 01:26:58.590
<i>There's that
sweaty smell.</i>

01:27:00.049 --> 01:27:01.467
You think, um,

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.220
it'd be crazy if

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.517
we did something together?

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:13.479
Are you asking
me out on a date?

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.441
Well, I just think that

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:18.776
I'd be an all-time fool
if I just

01:27:19.652 --> 01:27:21.237
watched you drive away.

01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:24.949
<i>Enough talking.
Use your nose!</i>

01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:26.326
Then don't.

01:27:37.962 --> 01:27:41.049
<i>Okay.
Now you're getting it.</i>

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.848
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

01:27:52.936 --> 01:27:55.146
<i>Get out of here.
Give 'em some space.</i>

01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:06.950
Hi, you little cutie pie.

01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:09.160
My water has mint in it.

01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:13.414
You have a good time?

01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:18.294
<i>Once they started licking faces,
no one could stop them.</i>

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:21.089
<i>Ethan finally had
what he needed.</i>

01:28:21.798 --> 01:28:23.257
<i>He was happy.</i>

01:28:24.425 --> 01:28:26.094
<i>I was happy, too.</i>

01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:30.473
Excuse me, everybody.
I would like to

01:28:30.556 --> 01:28:32.725
thank you all for
coming here today.

01:28:33.601 --> 01:28:35.645
It means a lot
to Hannah and I.

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:37.647
I've always
wanted a big family.

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:39.691
All in one day,
I've got one.

01:28:39.774 --> 01:28:41.401
You didn't tell me
how big it was.

01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:44.070
I just would like to say

01:28:44.237 --> 01:28:47.448
how grateful I am
that my beautiful girl

01:28:48.658 --> 01:28:50.159
walked back into my life.

01:28:50.868 --> 01:28:52.245
Thank you.

01:28:52.578 --> 01:28:54.122
Life's a mystery.

01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:56.582
Cheers!

01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:01.671
<i>There was
one thing I still wanted.</i>

01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:04.090
<i>I wanted him to know
it was me.</i>

01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.176
<i>That I was Bailey.</i>

01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:17.895
Wait, didn't Bailey used to do that?
Yeah.

01:29:18.354 --> 01:29:19.897
It's a dog thing.

01:29:21.482 --> 01:29:23.776
<i>Bailey. I'm Bailey.</i>

01:29:25.403 --> 01:29:27.113
<i>There's gotta be a way.</i>

01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:35.413
<i>Hmm. Wait.</i>

01:29:37.999 --> 01:29:39.459
<i>That's familiar.</i>

01:29:58.144 --> 01:29:59.687
<i>I smelled...</i>

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:01.522
<i>Me.</i>

01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:09.655
What do you got there?

01:30:11.449 --> 01:30:13.534
Where did you find that?

01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:21.209
Hey.

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:24.087
You wanna play?

01:30:25.338 --> 01:30:26.506
Get ready.

01:30:26.672 --> 01:30:28.508
You have to really
go after this one.

01:30:30.676 --> 01:30:32.178
Go get it.

01:30:32.512 --> 01:30:33.846
Good boy!

01:30:34.305 --> 01:30:35.640
Come on, bring it here.

01:30:36.182 --> 01:30:37.391
Good one.

01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:40.853
All right.

01:30:41.771 --> 01:30:43.606
You go play, all right?

01:30:44.065 --> 01:30:45.316
Gotta get back.

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:53.991
What? What do you want?

01:30:59.122 --> 01:31:00.790
This is nuts.

01:31:08.673 --> 01:31:10.299
All right, Buddy.

01:31:10.383 --> 01:31:11.884
You wanna go for
the showstopper?

01:31:13.886 --> 01:31:15.555
You wanna try it?
You wanna get it?

01:31:17.515 --> 01:31:18.724
Ready?

01:31:18.808 --> 01:31:20.143
<i>I am ready.</i>

01:31:20.226 --> 01:31:21.435
Okay.

01:31:21.519 --> 01:31:22.562
Go!

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.742
Where did you learn
how to do that, Buddy?

01:31:41.956 --> 01:31:44.417
You are really starting
to freak me out, boss dog.

01:31:45.168 --> 01:31:47.003
<i>Yes, Ethan!
That's right.</i>

01:31:47.086 --> 01:31:49.547
<i>I'm your boss dog.
I'm Bailey.</i>

01:31:49.714 --> 01:31:50.798
<i>Say it.</i>

01:31:52.508 --> 01:31:53.843
Boss dog?

01:31:58.389 --> 01:31:59.807
Are you the boss dog?

01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:07.064
No.

01:32:07.231 --> 01:32:10.610
<i>Yes. It's me, Ethan.
It's me.</i>

01:32:14.488 --> 01:32:16.157
Bailey?

01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:27.543
Bailey.

01:32:36.385 --> 01:32:38.012
Boss dog.

01:32:39.096 --> 01:32:42.516
Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

01:32:52.985 --> 01:32:54.612
Yeah.

01:33:00.993 --> 01:33:03.454
<i>So,
in all my lives as a dog,</i>

01:33:03.746 --> 01:33:05.331
<i>here's what I've learned.</i>

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:08.292
<i>Have fun, obviously.</i>

01:33:10.169 --> 01:33:14.257
<i>Whenever possible, find someone
to save and save them.</i>

01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:17.426
<i>Lick the ones you love.</i>

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.554
<i>Don't get all sad-faced
about what happened</i>

01:33:21.389 --> 01:33:23.641
<i>and scrunchy-faced
about what could.</i>

01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:25.851
<i>Just be here now.</i>

01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:27.937
<i>Be</i>

01:33:28.104 --> 01:33:29.188
<i>here</i>

01:33:29.355 --> 01:33:30.648
<i>now.</i>

01:33:31.857 --> 01:33:33.734
<i>That's a dog's purpose.</i>
