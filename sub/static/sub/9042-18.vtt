WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:03.500
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.467
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I GOT TO
ASK YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

00:05.467 --> 00:07.633
I'M IN CHARGE OF THE
WEDDING INVITATIONS, ALL RIGHT?

00:07.633 --> 00:09.333
SO I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT'S GONNA SAY

00:09.333 --> 00:10.767
AND HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK.

00:10.767 --> 00:13.967
SO THESE HERE ARE
THE ENVELOPE AND PAPER CHOICES,

00:13.967 --> 00:15.800
THESE ARE SOME FONT SAMPLES,

00:15.800 --> 00:17.133
AND TISSUE PAPER INSERTS.

00:23.033 --> 00:24.367
- COME ON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:24.367 --> 00:25.633
- I GOT TO GET A DRAFT

00:25.633 --> 00:27.267
TO THE WEDDING
COORDINATOR LADY TODAY

00:27.267 --> 00:29.367
BECAUSE THESE HAVE TO BE
IN THE MAIL THIS WEEK.

00:29.367 --> 00:30.933
- WHY ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS?

00:30.933 --> 00:32.533
- IT'S IMPORTANT I PLAY A PART

00:32.533 --> 00:34.733
IN THE WEDDING PLANNING
EXPERIENCE.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.467
- YEAH, JUST TELL ME,

00:40.467 --> 00:43.000
CAN AMY DRINK A GLASS OF WATER
WHILE YOU SAY THAT?

00:46.400 --> 00:47.800
- WHY SHOULDN'T I HELP?

00:47.800 --> 00:50.367
I MEAN, IT IS OURWEDDING.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.967
- OH, GOD, YOU'RE STUPID!

00:51.967 --> 00:54.600
[laughing]

00:54.600 --> 00:57.000
- IT'S NOT YOURWEDDING,
HAMMERHEAD.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.833
THE WEDDING IS
FOR THE WOMAN.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.267
- YES.

01:00.267 --> 01:01.767
AMY'S BEEN DREAMING
ABOUT THIS DAY

01:01.767 --> 01:03.367
SINCE SHE WAS 12.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.733
HAVE YOU BEEN DREAMING ABOUT
THIS SINCE YOU WERE 12, HUH?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.400
HAVE YOU?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.600
- NO.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.833
- THAT'S RIGHT--
WHAT'D YOU CALL HIM?

01:10.833 --> 01:12.033
- HAMMERHEAD.

01:12.033 --> 01:14.333
- HAMMERHEAD!

01:14.333 --> 01:17.500
AMY DREAMS ABOUT WEDDINGS.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.433
YOU DREAM ABOUT
BEING LATE FOR WORK

01:19.433 --> 01:21.467
'CAUSE MOM'S STILL
POWDERING YOUR BOTTOM.

01:30.600 --> 01:36.200
- THAT WAS ONE TIME!

01:36.200 --> 01:37.633
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

01:37.633 --> 01:39.800
I NEED TO DO
THE WEDDING INVITATIONS.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.000
AMY WANTS ME TO DO IT,
SO I'M DOING IT.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.400
COME ON, HELP ME?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.167
- ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

01:48.167 --> 01:51.167
YOU WRITE A VERSION
OF THE INVITATION,

01:51.167 --> 01:54.600
BUT YOU DO A HORRIBLE JOB,
OKAY?

01:54.600 --> 01:57.233
SHE'LL SEE IT,
DO IT HERSELF,

01:57.233 --> 01:59.233
AND NEVER ASK YOU
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE

01:59.233 --> 02:02.133
WITH THIS WEDDING.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.433
YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:04.433 --> 02:05.833
- THAT'S TERRIBLE, RAYMOND.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.500
I'M NOT GONNA
INTENTIONALLY SCREW IT UP

02:07.500 --> 02:08.900
JUST TO GET OUT OF THE WORK.

02:08.900 --> 02:13.433
- HEY, DUMMY,
LISTEN TO YOUR STUPID BROTHER.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.700
- LOOK, LOOK,
WHEN WE GOT ENGAGED,

02:14.700 --> 02:16.767
DEBRA PUT ME IN CHARGE
OF THE MUSIC.

02:16.767 --> 02:19.200
OKAY, SO I FOUND A DJ.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.533
SHE WANTED A BAND,
SO I FOUND A BAND.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.400
SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE BAND,
SO I FOUND ANOTHER BAND.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.500
"NOPE!"

02:25.500 --> 02:28.467
THE TRUTH IS,
SHE WANTEDTO DO IT,

02:28.467 --> 02:30.600
BUT SHE JUST GOT IT IN HER HEAD

02:30.600 --> 02:35.233
THAT I SHOULD BE PART OF THIS
WHOLE WEDDING EXPERIENCE,

02:35.233 --> 02:36.833
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

02:36.833 --> 02:40.200
I SENT OVER THIS GUY WHO SANG
AND PLAYED THE ACCORDION.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.500
HE HAD A KEYBOARD

02:41.500 --> 02:44.433
WITH VIOLINS AND TRUMPETS
AND DRUM NOISES.

02:44.433 --> 02:49.100
HIS NAME WAS "ZIPPERS,
THE ONE-MAN WEDDING BAND."

02:49.100 --> 02:51.600
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE TELLS ME NEVER MIND,

02:51.600 --> 02:54.000
SHE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE MUSIC.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.167
I SAT DOWN, TURNED ON THE TV,
AND NEVER LOOKED BACK.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.700
- THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.067
- WHEN AMY ASKED WHEN AND WHERE
I WANTED TO GET MARRIED,

03:06.067 --> 03:07.733
I SAID I WOULDN'T MIND
A WINTER WEDDING

03:07.733 --> 03:10.367
BECAUSE OF ALL MY, YOU KNOW,
SWEATING...

03:14.800 --> 03:17.300
AND MAYBE NOT
A FANCY-SCHMANCY RECEPTION

03:17.300 --> 03:19.733
BECAUSE OF MY DISCOMFORT
AROUND BUSBOYS.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.367
- AND WHAT HAPPENED?

03:25.367 --> 03:27.533
- SPRING WEDDING.
FANCY-SCHMANCY.

03:27.533 --> 03:31.467
EIGHT BUSBOYS.

03:31.467 --> 03:35.500
- I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
SHE WANTSTO DO THIS.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.867
SCREW UP THE INVITATION,
SHOW IT TO HER,

03:38.867 --> 03:42.267
AND LETHER DO ALL THE WORK.

03:42.267 --> 03:43.600
DON'T YOU LOVE HER?

03:50.800 --> 03:52.000
- OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.400
- GOOD, GOOD.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.367
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HELP HIM
WITH IT, DAD.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.567
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT.

03:57.567 --> 04:00.833
ALL RIGHT, THE FIRST LINE
OF THIS THING SHOULD BE--

04:00.833 --> 04:02.667
- "ATTENTION, IDIOTS!"

04:04.633 --> 04:06.733
- NO.

04:06.733 --> 04:07.933
NO!

04:07.933 --> 04:09.233
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE SO BAD

04:09.233 --> 04:11.733
THAT SHE FIGURES OUT
IT'S ON PURPOSE.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.000
- OH, RIGHT.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.367
YOU'RE LIKE A GENIUS.

04:17.367 --> 04:19.767
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHAT'S THE FIRST LINE

04:19.767 --> 04:21.333
OF AN INVITATION SUPPOSED TO BE?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.200
- WELL, I GUESS IT SHOULD BE
SOMETHING LIKE,

04:23.200 --> 04:26.133
"MR. AND MRS.
HENRY AND PATRICIA MACDOUGALL

04:26.133 --> 04:28.133
REQUEST THE HONOR
OF YOUR PRESENCE"--

04:28.133 --> 04:29.467
- OKAY, OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.

04:29.467 --> 04:33.167
SO INSTEAD OF HENRY
AND PATRICIA MACDOUGALL,

04:33.167 --> 04:34.500
WE MAKE IT "HANK AND PAT."

04:39.033 --> 04:42.200
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.000
"HANK AND PAT."

04:45.000 --> 04:46.433
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:46.433 --> 04:48.767
MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THE "AND,"
YOU KNOW?

04:48.767 --> 04:52.700
MAYBE THE "AND" IS TOO FANCY.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.400
JUST MAKE IT AN "'N'"
WITH APOSTROPHES.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
"HANK 'N' PAT,"
YOU KNOW?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.967
LIKE SHAKE 'N' BAKE.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.167
PORK 'N' BEANS.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.167
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.567
- HUH?
CAN WE DO THAT?

05:09.567 --> 05:10.700
- WE JUST DID.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.567
- HEY, DEB.
- HI, ROBERT.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.767
- RAY HERE?
- SHOULD BE HOME SOON.

05:20.767 --> 05:22.733
- GOOD, WE'RE GONNA
WATCH THE KNICKS.

05:22.733 --> 05:25.033
- OH, GOSH,
THAT SOUNDS SO GREAT.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.100
- HEY, AMY.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.800
- WHAT DID YOU
DO? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.100
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:43.100 --> 05:44.333
THE INVITATIONS!

05:44.333 --> 05:45.833
MY AUNT LYNN
GOT THIS IN THE MAIL.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.167
WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.467
- OH, MY GOD,
THIS WAS IN THE MAIL?

05:57.467 --> 05:59.233
- WHAT DID YOU DO, ROBERT?

05:59.233 --> 06:00.433
- NOTHING, NOTHING.

06:00.433 --> 06:01.733
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GO OUT.

06:01.733 --> 06:04.867
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

06:04.867 --> 06:06.067
[gasps]

06:06.067 --> 06:08.133
OH, MY GOD!

06:08.133 --> 06:09.367
- I KNOW!

06:09.367 --> 06:10.833
I COULDN'T EVEN
FINISH READING IT

06:10.833 --> 06:12.133
BECAUSE SOMEONE
WAS SCREAMING,

06:12.133 --> 06:14.233
AND THEN I REALIZED
IT WAS ME!

06:17.233 --> 06:18.467
- THE WEDDING PLANNER LADY

06:18.467 --> 06:20.000
WAS SUPPOSED TO
PRINT IT OUT FOR YOU,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.567
AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO LOOK IT OVER!

06:21.567 --> 06:24.100
- SHE SAID YOU SAID SENT IT OUT.
- NO, I SAID PRINT IT OUT!

06:24.100 --> 06:25.500
- BUT SHE SENT IT OUT.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.267
- OH, MY GOD!

06:28.267 --> 06:32.067
- AMY, OH, MY GOD!

06:32.067 --> 06:35.033
- I KNOW!
OH, MY GOD!

06:35.033 --> 06:36.600
- WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.533
- ROBERT!
ROBERT HAPPENED TO IT!

06:38.533 --> 06:41.200
- THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT!

06:41.200 --> 06:42.800
- LOOK AT THIS!

06:42.800 --> 06:44.633
HANK 'N' PAT?

06:44.633 --> 06:45.833
'N'PAT?

06:45.833 --> 06:47.533
'N'PAT!

06:47.533 --> 06:49.667
THEY'RE NOT HILLBILLIES,
ROBERT!

06:51.967 --> 06:53.700
"HANK 'N'PAT MACDOUGALL

06:53.700 --> 06:55.567
REQUEST THE HONOR
OF YOUR PRESENTS"--

06:55.567 --> 06:59.733
- ROBERT, YOU SPELLED "PRESENTS"
LIKE GIFTS!

06:59.733 --> 07:01.467
- IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT!

07:06.967 --> 07:08.967
- YOU EVEN PUT THE WRONG DATE!

07:08.967 --> 07:10.733
IT'S THE 9TH,
NOT THE 6TH.

07:10.733 --> 07:13.267
PEOPLE ARE GONNA SHOW UP
THREE DAYS EARLY!

07:13.267 --> 07:16.200
- AND, ROBERT, WHAT IS THIS?
"ATTIRE OPTIONAL"?

07:19.500 --> 07:22.633
- IT'S BLACK TIE OPTIONAL!

07:22.633 --> 07:26.133
"ATTIRE OPTIONAL"
MEANS MAYBE NAKED!

07:27.467 --> 07:29.967
THERE'S GOING
TO BE NUDEPEOPLE!

07:29.967 --> 07:31.833
AT THE CHURCH!

07:31.833 --> 07:33.300
ON A WEDNESDAY!

07:37.033 --> 07:38.567
- WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GO OUT.

07:44.733 --> 07:46.267
- OH, MY GOD...

07:46.267 --> 07:48.300
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.767
- WHAT? NO!
I DO!

07:49.767 --> 07:51.400
OF COURSE I DO.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.267
- THEN WHY WOULD YOU
MAKE ALL THESE MISTAKES?

07:53.267 --> 07:54.467
THEY'RE SO OBVIOUS.

07:54.467 --> 07:57.033
YOU'RE SABOTAGING THE WEDDING.

07:57.033 --> 07:58.833
YOU DON'T WANT TO MARRY ME.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.167
- NO, NO!

08:00.167 --> 08:03.200
OF COURSE I WANT
TO MARRY YOU, AMY.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.467
OH, ALL RIGHT. DON'T CRY.

08:04.467 --> 08:05.867
DON'T CRY.
COME ON.

08:05.867 --> 08:08.667
HERE, LOOK.

08:08.667 --> 08:09.867
SEE?
COME ON.

08:09.867 --> 08:11.967
NO.
ALL RIGHT.

08:11.967 --> 08:14.233
LISTEN.
LISTEN.

08:14.233 --> 08:17.100
THAT ISN'T WHY
I MADE THOSE MISTAKES.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.467
- THEN WHY DID YOU?

08:19.467 --> 08:21.700
- BECAUSE--

08:21.700 --> 08:23.333
- ROBERT...

08:24.867 --> 08:26.700
- OKAY.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.600
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.833
WE JUST THOUGHT--

08:30.833 --> 08:32.200
- "WE"?
WHO'S "WE"?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.533
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.900
- ME AND...

08:38.900 --> 08:43.200
SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS
THAT WERE AROUND THAT DAY.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.733
both: OHH.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.733
- SEE, WE JUST THOUGHT
THAT BY ME DOING THE INVITATION,

08:51.733 --> 08:54.233
IT WAS TAKING SOMETHING PRECIOUS
AWAYFROM YOU,

08:54.233 --> 08:56.333
SO BY ME DOING
A BAD JOB AT IT,

08:56.333 --> 08:59.133
IT WAS MEANT
AS A GIFTTO YOU,

08:59.133 --> 09:02.067
AND THE LADY WHO SENT IT OUT

09:02.067 --> 09:03.700
WILL SUFFER!

09:08.967 --> 09:11.833
- SO YOU DID THIS ON PURPOSE.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.967
YOU FAKED INCOMPETENCE
JUST TO GET OUT OF IT?

09:14.967 --> 09:17.700
- NO, I DID IT FOR YOU
AS A GIFT

09:17.700 --> 09:20.367
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
DREAMING ABOUT THIS

09:20.367 --> 09:22.300
SINCE YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD,

09:22.300 --> 09:26.100
AND I THINK RAYMOND
COULD EXPLAIN IT BETTER.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.700
- I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.333
- OH, MY GOD, I'VE GOT TO

09:30.333 --> 09:31.800
GET THE NEW INVITATIONS OUT
RIGHT AWAY!

09:31.800 --> 09:33.267
- LET ME HELP YOU, HONEY.
LET'S GO.

09:33.267 --> 09:34.700
- AMY, I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.167
LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO.

09:37.167 --> 09:38.367
- THANKS.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.733
JUST KILL RAY FOR ME.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.633
- OH, HONEY,
I WILL.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.733
- HEY, WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I JUST HANG--

09:53.733 --> 09:55.067
OKAY.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.500
- HEY, JELLY CHEEKS!

10:08.200 --> 10:09.533
GOT THE MAIL.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.267
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.900
ROBERT AND AMY'S
WEDDING INVITATION.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.233
ALREADY?

10:15.233 --> 10:17.167
THAT AMY,
SHE'S ON TOP OF THINGS.

10:17.167 --> 10:18.733
- YEAH, HEY, OPEN IT UP.

10:18.733 --> 10:20.067
- ALL RIGHTY.

10:23.267 --> 10:24.667
SO HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.000
- JUST DANDY.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
HOW'S IT LOOK?

10:48.800 --> 10:50.000
- GOOD.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.900
IT'S GOOD.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.133
- CAN I SEE IT?

10:54.133 --> 10:55.467
- I'M NOT DONE YET.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.200
AW, SHOOT!
AH, GOD!

11:03.200 --> 11:06.633
SHOOTY-SHOOT-SHOOT!

11:06.633 --> 11:08.800
IT'S ALL RUINED NOW.
I'LL THROW IT OUT.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.100
- I'D LIKE TO SEE IT, RAY.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.900
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME--

11:11.900 --> 11:13.833
I'LL DRY IT OFF FOR YOU.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.500
LET ME DRY IT OFF.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.000
AH!
AH!

11:25.000 --> 11:26.400
STAY BACK!

11:26.400 --> 11:28.467
OH, GOD!

11:28.467 --> 11:31.600
[garbage disposal rumbles]

11:41.600 --> 11:43.100
WELL, WE DON'T NEED
AN INVITATION.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.167
WE KNOW WHEN THE WEDDING IS,
RIGHT?

11:45.167 --> 11:46.367
ANYWAY, WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

11:46.367 --> 11:48.533
SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.667
DAMN, WOMAN!

11:55.833 --> 11:57.767
- I SAW THE INVITATION, RAY.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.267
- NO, IT'S BURNED,
AND IT'S DOWN THE DRAIN.

12:01.833 --> 12:04.000
- I KNOWWHAT YOU DID.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.200
- WHAT?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.633
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:06.633 --> 12:09.367
- ROBERT TOLD US
ABOUT THE HELPYOU GAVE HIM.

12:09.367 --> 12:10.733
FAKING INCOMPETENCE

12:10.733 --> 12:12.200
SO HE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING

12:12.200 --> 12:13.967
FOR HIS OWN WEDDING?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.700
AMY'S A MESS!

12:15.700 --> 12:16.900
- OKAY, LOOK, ROBERT--

12:16.900 --> 12:18.100
HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT RIGHT.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.400
STUPID, STUPID, ROBERT!

12:19.400 --> 12:21.533
IT'S TO MAKE AMY'S LIFE EASIER!

12:21.533 --> 12:23.633
- IT'S TO MAKE HISLIFE EASIER!

12:23.633 --> 12:25.733
YOU TOLD HIM
TO SCREW UP THEIR WEDDING!

12:25.733 --> 12:27.367
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

12:27.367 --> 12:29.300
IT'S THEIR WEDDING!

12:29.300 --> 12:31.033
WOULD YOU HAVE DONE THAT
WITH OUR WEDDING?

12:31.033 --> 12:32.533
WOULD YOU HAVE PURPOSELY
DONE SOME--

12:42.267 --> 12:44.500
THE ONE-MAN WEDDING BAND!

12:46.633 --> 12:48.300
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU!

12:48.300 --> 12:51.133
YOU JUST SCAMMED ME
SO YOU COULD DO NOTHING!

12:51.133 --> 12:52.367
- THERE WAS NO SCAM!

12:52.367 --> 12:54.667
NO, HE SOUNDED GREAT
IN THE SUBWAY.

12:54.667 --> 12:55.867
NO, I--

12:55.867 --> 12:57.067
HEY, IT TURNED OUT GREAT.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.467
YOU GOT A KICK-ASS BAND.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.700
DAMN, WOMAN.

13:00.700 --> 13:03.567
OW!

13:03.567 --> 13:05.167
COME ON, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.633
ALL RIGHT,
I SHOULD'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.867
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
TOLD ROBERT THAT STUFF.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.667
I'LL APOLOGIZE.
I'LL CALL AMY AND APOLOGIZE.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.267
AND I SHOULD'VE
NEVER HIRED ZIPPERS.

13:14.267 --> 13:16.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.833
YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT I WAS...

13:18.833 --> 13:22.200
IN LOVE!

13:22.200 --> 13:23.600
AND WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE,

13:23.600 --> 13:26.233
EVERYTHING SOUNDS LIKE
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.767
- RAY--
- LIKE THAT.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.433
THAT'S LIKE
THE ANGELS ARE SINGING.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.500
- FOLD THIS!
- WHAT?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.433
- FOLD THIS SHIRT!
- WHY?

13:37.433 --> 13:39.500
- WHEN WE FIRST GOT MARRIED
AND YOU USED TO FOLD STUFF,

13:39.500 --> 13:41.800
I WOULD THINK, "HOW COULD
HE BE SO BAD AT THIS?

13:41.800 --> 13:43.000
LOOK AT ALL THE WRINKLES."

13:43.000 --> 13:44.200
AND NOW I KNOW.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.833
YOU FAKED IT!
- WHAT?

13:45.833 --> 13:48.233
- ADMIT IT, YOU FAKED IT
SO I WOULD DO IT FOR YOU!

13:48.233 --> 13:49.767
- NO, NO,
THERE WAS NO FAKE!

13:49.767 --> 13:52.533
- THEN EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW YOU CAN'T FOLD A SHIRT!

13:52.533 --> 13:55.267
EXPLAIN TO ME HOW
AN ADULT HUMAN WITH THUMBS

13:55.267 --> 13:57.133
IS NOT ABLE TO DO THAT!

13:59.533 --> 14:01.067
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.033
- UH-HUH, YEAH?

14:03.033 --> 14:04.800
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU FAKED?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.067
- NOTHING!
COME ON!

14:06.067 --> 14:07.267
- THE BED!

14:07.267 --> 14:08.567
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:08.567 --> 14:11.400
THAT'S ONE PLACE
I ALWAYS GIVE 110%!

14:14.100 --> 14:15.967
- I MEAN MAKINGTHE BED!

14:15.967 --> 14:18.533
IN TEN YEARS, YOU HAVEN'T
MADE THE BED BECAUSE

14:18.533 --> 14:20.933
"I'M NO GOOD AT TUCKING."

14:20.933 --> 14:22.800
ADMIT IT, YOU FAKED IT,
YOU FAKER!

14:22.800 --> 14:24.000
- NO!

14:24.000 --> 14:25.300
- WHAT ELSE, RAY?
HUH, WHAT ELSE?

14:25.300 --> 14:26.667
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
IN THE KITCHEN!

14:26.667 --> 14:29.633
YOU DON'T BUY GROCERIES,
YOU--

14:29.633 --> 14:31.033
DIAPERS!

14:32.167 --> 14:33.800
THREE KIDS, AND YOU ONLY
CHANGED, LIKE,

14:33.800 --> 14:35.233
TEN DIAPERS IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

14:35.233 --> 14:37.333
"I CAN'T DO IT.
THE DIAPERS KEEP FALLING OFF."

14:37.333 --> 14:39.400
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THE KIDS HAVE NO HIPS.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.133
- FOLD THIS.
- I CAN'T--

14:45.133 --> 14:46.600
- FOLD IT, YOU FAKE HUSBAND!

14:46.600 --> 14:47.800
FOLD IT!

14:47.800 --> 14:49.000
- STOP! NO! NO!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.333
STOP IT!

14:54.667 --> 14:56.000
- I HAVE HAD IT, RAY.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.067
THE JIG IS UP.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.467
- WHAT JIG?

14:59.467 --> 15:01.900
COME ON, ME NOT BEING ABLE
TO DO THAT STUFF,

15:01.900 --> 15:03.133
THAT'S NOT FAKE.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.900
THERE'S NO JIG!

15:05.900 --> 15:07.533
I DON'T HAVE A JIG!

15:12.567 --> 15:13.700
ROBERT!

15:16.767 --> 15:18.100
YOU TRY TO HELP A GUY...

15:32.033 --> 15:34.667
- GO ON,
TELL DEBRA WHAT AMY WANTS.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.700
- MA, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FOLLOW ME AROUND.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.633
I CAN HANDLE THIS MYSELF.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.967
- WE'LL DECIDE
WHAT YOU CAN HANDLE.

15:41.967 --> 15:43.433
NOW TALK.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.000
- AMY WANTS YOU TO LOOK
AT THESE BRIDESMAIDS DRESSES

15:46.000 --> 15:47.867
AND TELL HER
WHICH ONE YOU LIKE BEST.

15:47.867 --> 15:49.067
- FINE.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.400
YOU CAN HANG THEM BACK THERE.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, RAYMOND?

15:56.300 --> 15:57.733
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MARIE,

15:57.733 --> 15:59.500
HE'S ACTUALLY
DOING SOME WORK AROUND HERE.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.633
- IS THIS HIS PUNISHMENT
FOR RUINING AMY'S INVITATIONS

16:02.633 --> 16:05.033
AND TRYING TO GET OUT OF WORK
HIS WHOLE LIFE?

16:05.033 --> 16:06.767
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH!

16:06.767 --> 16:08.467
- OW!

16:08.467 --> 16:10.100
WHY DON'T YOU TWIST HISEAR?

16:10.100 --> 16:13.200
- BELIEVE ME, I'M ALREADY
IN ENOUGH TROUBLE WITH AMY.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.467
ONE MORE MISTAKE,
AND SHE'S GONNA

16:14.467 --> 16:19.867
TAKE MY ARM OFF LIKE A PUMA.

16:19.867 --> 16:21.467
- ALL RIGHT, MARIE!

16:21.467 --> 16:22.800
I GET IT!

16:22.800 --> 16:25.833
YOU'RE TICKED OFF AT ME
BECAUSE OF ALL THIS AMY CRAP

16:25.833 --> 16:27.933
EVEN THOUGH I TRIED
TO TALK THESE TWO OUT OF IT.

16:27.933 --> 16:29.933
- WHAT?
GET OUT OF HERE!

16:29.933 --> 16:31.133
- WHAT?

16:31.133 --> 16:33.467
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:33.467 --> 16:36.700
- NOW, STOP IGNORING ME
AND MAKE ME SOME LUNCH!

16:36.700 --> 16:38.067
I'M FEELING...

16:38.067 --> 16:39.400
POT ROASTY.

16:42.867 --> 16:44.967
- MAKE IT YOURSELF.

16:44.967 --> 16:47.167
- MYSELF?

16:47.167 --> 16:49.933
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:49.933 --> 16:51.467
- I'M ON TO YOU.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.700
YOU PRETEND TO BE A STUPID ASS

16:53.700 --> 16:56.300
SO I CAN WAIT ON YOU
HAND AND FOOT.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.767
IT'S OVER.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.900
- DAD, YOU JUST GONNA TAKE THAT?

17:08.900 --> 17:10.100
- 45 YEARS.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.433
I HAD A GOOD RUN.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.467
- YOU BOYS OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

17:20.467 --> 17:22.100
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT FRANK AND RAYMOND

17:22.100 --> 17:24.000
HAVE TREATED US
SO POORLY OVER THE YEARS,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.500
BUT I WILL NOT STAND STILL

17:25.500 --> 17:28.733
AND ALLOW ANOTHER ONE
OF MY SONS TO BE SEDUCED

17:28.733 --> 17:30.900
BY THE LIFESTYLE OF THE BUM.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.100
- COULD I SAY SOMETHING?

17:32.100 --> 17:33.933
- NO!

17:33.933 --> 17:35.300
- MARIE'S RIGHT.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.067
YOU GUYS JUST WANT US
TO SHUT UP AND SERVE YOU

17:37.067 --> 17:38.800
SO YOU CAN WATCH TV
ALL DAY LONG.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.133
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, RAY?

17:40.133 --> 17:42.833
- I THINK YOU'RE GENERALIZING.

17:42.833 --> 17:45.500
- YOU DON'T COME HOME
AND JUST TURN ON THE TV?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.200
- IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING
WITH HIM.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.300
HE COMES HOME FROM THE LODGE,
THE TV GOES ON,

17:50.300 --> 17:51.800
AND I CAN'T GET
TWO WORDS OUT OF HIM.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.767
- I'LL GIVE YOU TWO WORDS.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.133
- TV, VCR--

17:57.133 --> 17:58.700
IT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.800
I SWEAR, RAY, THE ONLY TIME
YOU CALL ME DURING THE DAY

18:00.800 --> 18:02.433
IS WHEN YOU WANT ME
TO TAPE STUFF FOR YOU

18:02.433 --> 18:03.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING LATE.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.133
- NOT "STUFF."

18:05.133 --> 18:08.200
GAMES THAT I HAVE TO WATCH
FOR WORK, OKAY?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.567
SO I CAN BUY FOOD
AND ELECTRICITY

18:10.567 --> 18:12.433
FOR THE CHILDREN!

18:12.433 --> 18:14.467
BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY
I ASK YOU TO TAPE ANYTHING

18:14.467 --> 18:15.900
'CAUSE YOU NEVER DO IT RIGHT.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.433
- YEAH!

18:17.433 --> 18:19.500
- SHE TALKS, BUT SHE CAN'T
FIGURE OUT THE DAMN VCR!

18:19.500 --> 18:21.300
HOW HARD IS IT
TO TAPE SOMETHING?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.633
I MEAN, IF I CAN DO IT--

18:29.100 --> 18:32.067
FAKER!

18:32.067 --> 18:33.500
- WHAT?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.300
- YOU COULD USE THE VCR,
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO,

18:35.300 --> 18:38.433
SO YOU PRETEND
NOT TO BE ABLE TO.

18:38.433 --> 18:39.700
FAKER!

18:39.700 --> 18:40.900
- THAT IS IDIOTIC.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.667
- NO, IT'S RIGHT-IOTIC!

18:46.833 --> 18:50.600
WELL, THE SHOE'S ON
THE OTHER FOOT NOW!

18:50.600 --> 18:55.567
UNCOMFORTABLE AND SMELLY,
IS IT NOT?

18:55.567 --> 18:57.033
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:57.033 --> 19:01.233
I'M STARTING TO THINK
YOU COULDSHOVEL THE DRIVEWAY!

19:01.233 --> 19:02.633
[knocking on door]

19:02.633 --> 19:03.633
- HI.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.733
all: HEY, AMY.
- HI, ROBERT.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.633
- HI, I WAS JUST DOING
ALL THE DRESSES

19:07.633 --> 19:11.500
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT
AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.800
- LISTEN,

19:12.800 --> 19:14.667
I DON'T WANT TO BE MAD ANYMORE.

19:14.667 --> 19:15.867
I DON'T.

19:15.867 --> 19:17.100
- REALLY?

19:17.100 --> 19:19.433
- I WAS UPSET
ABOUT THOSE INVITATIONS,

19:19.433 --> 19:21.233
BUT THEY'RE JUST
PIECES OF PAPER.

19:21.233 --> 19:24.333
THEY'RE NOT WHAT REALLY MATTERS.

19:27.633 --> 19:31.400
- I BET WE LAUGH ABOUT THIS
ONE DAY WITH OUR KIDS.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.300
- WELL, MAYBE
THE GRANDKIDS.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.267
- ISN'T SHE AMAZING?

19:38.267 --> 19:41.400
WE COULD ALL LEARN
A BIG LESSON FROM HER.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.733
THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT
YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.467
- [scoffs]

19:51.533 --> 19:52.967
- WHAT?

19:52.967 --> 19:54.233
- I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

19:54.233 --> 19:55.800
BUT SHE'S JUST
FAKING FORGIVENESS

19:55.800 --> 20:00.133
SO SHE CAN HOLD IT OVER YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.467
FAKE!

20:03.200 --> 20:04.667
- I'M NOT FAKING.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.867
- THE TRUTH IS, DEAR,

20:05.867 --> 20:07.267
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE MAD AT HIM.

20:07.267 --> 20:09.333
IN FACT,
KEEPING THAT ANGER BOTTLED UP

20:09.333 --> 20:11.200
COULD BE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.367
- THAT'S WHY THIS ONE'LL
LIVE TO BE 100.

20:14.933 --> 20:17.300
- AMY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET HIM
OFF THE HOOK SO EASILY.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.667
WHAT HE DID WAS HURTFUL,

20:18.667 --> 20:21.067
JUST LIKE RAY
AND HIS ONE-MAN ZIPPER BAND.

20:21.067 --> 20:23.233
- HE DIDN'T PLAY THE ZIPPER.

20:23.233 --> 20:24.767
THAT WAS HIS NAME.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.733
- IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS?

20:28.733 --> 20:32.700
IS THIS WHAT MARRIAGE
HAS BECOME FOR YOU GUYS?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.367
ROBERT AND I
ARE GETTING MARRIED,

20:34.367 --> 20:37.533
AND I WANT US TO BE HONEST
AND TRUSTING,

20:37.533 --> 20:40.000
AND I HOPE THOSE FEELINGS
WILL ONLY GET STRONGER

20:40.000 --> 20:42.067
THE LONGER WE'RE TOGETHER.

20:42.067 --> 20:43.667
I'M SORRY, I JUST--

20:43.667 --> 20:44.700
I WANT TO GET MARRIED

20:44.700 --> 20:47.300
BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW GREAT IT CAN BE.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.333
MAYBE IT ISN'T EASY,

20:49.333 --> 20:51.433
BUT I THINK
IT'S WORTH GOING FOR.

20:54.767 --> 20:57.167
- I THINK SO TOO.

20:57.167 --> 20:58.500
COME ON, AMY.

21:01.867 --> 21:04.200
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.567
- WOW.

21:11.567 --> 21:14.033
- YEAH.

21:14.033 --> 21:16.100
- REMEMBER WHEN
WE WERE THAT STUPID?
