* spirit of my silence *

00:24.058 --> 00:26.492
* I can hear you *

00:26.494 --> 00:29.328
* but I'm afraid
to be near you *

00:29.330 --> 00:31.563
* and I don't know *

00:31.565 --> 00:34.566
* where to begin *

00:34.568 --> 00:37.903
okay, I'm ready.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.406
You promise
you like your gift?

00:40.408 --> 00:43.509
The towel?
It's absolutely terrible.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.244
Suit's on?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.912
Yes, ma'am.
Your birthday suit.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.148
Only one I've got.

00:55.322 --> 00:58.190
I had to put the lingerie
on top of my clothes.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.258
I see that.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.093
It wasn't a great moment for me.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.595
Tradition is tradition.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.397
Yeah. But I'm gonna go ahead

01:05.399 --> 01:07.566
and spare us both
the seductive birthday dance

01:07.568 --> 01:10.335
this year.
I'm sorry, baby,
but it's my birthday,

01:10.337 --> 01:14.840
and I would really, really like
to see the dance.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.581
Your funeral.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.416
Mm-hmm.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.784
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.589
You like it,

01:30.591 --> 01:31.757
right?

01:31.759 --> 01:32.758
This is what you want.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.759
A little of that.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.427
A little of that, for you?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.529
I will gag

01:37.531 --> 01:38.430
you dead with that towel.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.132
Okay, okay.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.534
I'm quiet.
Come on.

01:46.774 --> 01:51.243
* Amethyst and flowers
on the table *

01:51.245 --> 01:53.078
* is it real or a fable? *

01:53.080 --> 01:56.315
* well, I suppose *

01:56.317 --> 01:59.118
* a friend is a friend *

01:59.120 --> 02:02.254
* And we all know *

02:02.256 --> 02:03.989
* how this will end *

02:03.991 --> 02:06.825
you suck.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.306
* What is that song *

02:21.308 --> 02:22.975
* you sing for the dead? *

02:22.977 --> 02:25.944
* I see the signal searchlight *

* strike me in the window *

02:28.582 --> 02:30.415

02:30.417 --> 02:31.650
Got a sec, boss?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.919
Yeah. What's up?

02:33.921 --> 02:38.157
* Happy Birthday to you *

02:38.159 --> 02:39.625
* Happy Birthday *

02:39.627 --> 02:41.460
Yeah...
* to you *

02:41.462 --> 02:43.629
* happy... *

02:43.631 --> 02:48.433
* I forgive you, mother,
i can hear you *

02:48.435 --> 02:51.770
* and I long to be near you *

02:51.772 --> 02:54.439
We love your show.
Huh?

02:54.441 --> 02:55.641
Do you want to dance?

02:55.643 --> 02:56.775
Uh-uh. No. But, um,

02:56.777 --> 02:58.010
you know, you go ahead.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.017
It's my birthday today.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.220
36 today.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.788
You don't look 36.
Yeah,

03:09.790 --> 03:11.490
I do.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.159
*<i> happy 36th birthday to you</i> *

03:14.161 --> 03:15.661
* happy 36th birthday to you *

03:15.663 --> 03:17.396
* I have triplets
inside of me *

03:17.398 --> 03:19.631
* I am shamu *

03:19.633 --> 03:23.235
* we all know
how this will end *

03:23.237 --> 03:26.838
hey, big three,
do you three know

03:26.840 --> 03:29.241
how much I love your mother?
I mean, do you even have

03:29.243 --> 03:32.077
any idea?
- Yeah, we do. Now shut up

03:32.079 --> 03:34.813
and let your fat-ass wife
go to sleep.
No.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.316
No, no, no. Birthday tradition
is birthday tradition.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.518
So close your eyes in there,
kids, because daddy's about

03:39.520 --> 03:43.822
to do some real terrible things
to mommy.

03:43.824 --> 03:48.594
* I see the signal searchlight
strike me *

03:48.596 --> 03:50.229
* in the window *

03:50.231 --> 03:55.400

04:04.945 --> 04:08.747
* you sing for the dead? *

04:08.749 --> 04:10.682
* what is that song *

04:10.684 --> 04:11.783
* you sing for the dead? *

04:11.785 --> 04:13.418
how could you possibly want me

04:13.420 --> 04:14.419
right now?

04:14.421 --> 04:15.921
In any state, my wife,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.589
you arouse me.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.091
I bet I can make that go away.

04:20.094 --> 04:23.695
There's nothing
you can say that's...
My water just broke.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.265
Yep.
Yeah.

04:28.435 --> 04:32.104
* My hands to myself *

04:32.106 --> 04:33.939
* can't keep my hands... *

04:33.941 --> 04:36.575
you know when I think it
all went wrong for me was 1986,

04:36.577 --> 04:38.644
second grade. They were sending
the <i> challenger</i> up into space.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.911
You remember the <i> challenger,</i>
right?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.647
Yeah. With
Sandra bullock?
No.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.749
Christa mcauliffe, right?
She was gonna be

04:43.751 --> 04:45.117
the first teacher
into space.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.152
She was actually
gonna change the world.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.321
I don't know how, but
you could feel that, you know?

04:49.323 --> 04:51.256
At least, in second grade,
you could... you could feel it.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.491
<i> Middle of the school day,</i>

04:52.493 --> 04:54.259
the teacher brings in a TV,
right?

04:54.261 --> 04:55.927
We're all just sitting there,
watching the launch,

04:55.929 --> 04:58.964
a bunch of seven-year-olds
just-just watchin'.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.666
And all of a sudden, boom!

05:00.668 --> 05:02.668
The whole thing explodes.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.836
Little pieces
of sweet christa mcauliffe

05:04.838 --> 05:07.105
come raining down
all over the state of Florida.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.508
It was awful.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.344
Maybe that's when I realized
trying to change the world

05:12.346 --> 05:14.646
just leads to being blown up

05:14.648 --> 05:17.649
into little pieces
all over Florida.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.255
Maybe that's how i
wound up as the man-NY.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.796
It's my sister.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.831
Kate?

05:35.469 --> 05:39.971
You... you didn't have
any ice, so...

05:39.973 --> 05:42.741
Well, this is a low point.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.016
We're 36.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.851
We're officially late 30s.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.388
Like, we are deep in the threes.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.324
Yep.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.394
How did I get here?

06:02.396 --> 06:05.230
Like, how the hell
did I get here?

06:05.232 --> 06:07.399
Remember second grade,
the <i> challenger</i> explosion?

06:07.401 --> 06:08.567
You have got to stop
with the <i> challenger</i> explosion.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.135
There's something there.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.841
You're the only good thing
in my life, kev.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.810
I'm not that great. Come on.
I know.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.412
That's what makes it worse.

06:22.316 --> 06:25.083
I had this...

06:25.085 --> 06:28.987
Whole dream life
that I envisioned for myself.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.424
A real career.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.926
I would marry a man like dad.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.229
I would be a mom like mom.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.798
But look
at me, kev.

06:41.769 --> 06:46.405
Like, I ate my dream life away.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.241
So what do you... what do you
want me to say to you, huh?

06:49.243 --> 06:51.843
Wh-what... give me
the magic phrase, sis, to say

06:51.845 --> 06:53.745
to make you feel better
and I'll say it.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.580
Tell me to quit feeling sorry
for myself. I don't know.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.416
Tell me to wake the hell up.
Tell me,

06:57.418 --> 07:00.352
tell me to lose the damn weight.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.587
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.991
All right? That can start
right now. Wake the hell up.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.694
And-and, you know...

07:09.696 --> 07:12.197
The... what was the...
What was the third thing?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.599
Lose the
damn weight.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.003
You want to say that again?

07:19.072 --> 07:22.641
I'm gonna lose the damn weight.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.482
You are a lot smarter
than you look.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.652
That's what Michael bay told me.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.928
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.797
Thank you.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.799
Hey, do you realize me
and the kids

07:47.801 --> 07:50.268
are gonna have
the same birthday?
- I know.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.603
Yeah.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.505
Still, six weeks early

07:53.507 --> 07:55.106
is pretty early.
Yeah.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.142
I know.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.954
What the hell could this thing
possibly be for?

08:08.956 --> 08:11.590
It's for rectal examinations.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.592
That one's from the dirty pile.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.160
Sorry.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.430
Now, then, I'm Dr. katowski,

08:18.432 --> 08:22.601
but you can call me doc
or Dr. k,

08:22.603 --> 08:25.103
which is what most people
choose to do

08:25.105 --> 08:27.272
because it's folksy.
Oh,

08:27.274 --> 08:28.640
so you work with Dr. Schneider?

08:28.642 --> 08:31.476
Take a breath for me, dear.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.010
Deep breath, now.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.780
There you go.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.650
All right. You relaxed?
Good, good, good.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.186
Dr. Schneider's appendix burst

08:41.188 --> 08:44.222
an hour ago. He just
went into surgery. No, no,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.624
No, no, no. Now, stay with me.
Oh, God. No, i
need Dr. Schneider

08:45.626 --> 08:47.225
'cause he knows about...
Stay with me now.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.995
Between his screams of agony,
Schneider

08:49.997 --> 08:53.231
brought me up to speed on
everything concerning your case.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.368
I know all about these triplets,
and I know that this

08:56.370 --> 08:58.403
is a high-risk
pregnancy.
Yeah.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.838
But everything's gonna be
all right.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.806
This is some kind
of bad joke,

09:01.808 --> 09:03.808
right?
It is not, unfortunately.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.579
Now, sweetheart, I'm gonna get
straight to your first concern.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.514
Look at me now.
Look at me.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.918
Do you see me?
I am 73 years old.
Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.487
You know what that means,
don't you?
No.

09:15.489 --> 09:19.758
That means I don't run wind
sprints as fast as I used to,

09:19.760 --> 09:23.595
but my faculties are
otherwise completely intact.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.231
There are days
that I wish they weren't,

09:26.233 --> 09:29.401
because then I would retire
and spend my remaining days

09:29.403 --> 09:31.903
doing something more glamorous
than pulling eight-pound objects

09:31.905 --> 09:33.505
out of women's vaginas.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.173
But until
that time,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.409
I keep showing up
here every day.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.444
All right?

09:39.446 --> 09:42.781
I'm also aware that
I'm a complete stranger to you,

09:42.783 --> 09:45.417
and this is the biggest moment

09:45.419 --> 09:47.419
of your life.
Yeah.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.922
All right? Honey,
listen to me,
yeah.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.425
I am the best of the best.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.861
And I swear to you,
on the lives of my children

09:56.863 --> 09:59.864
and my grandchildren,
that I am up to the task.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.767
All right? All right.
Okay.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.970
Thank you.
All right.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.638
Good.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.840
Now,
which one of you's pregnant?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.144
Now, that was a bad joke, but

10:13.146 --> 10:15.614
you just continue
to take those deep breaths...

10:15.616 --> 10:17.782
Let's see... let me see
if any of my people are here.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.251
Let me take a little test.
<i> Sheket bevakasha!</i>

10:20.253 --> 10:23.254
Jew! Jew!

10:23.256 --> 10:24.422
Jew!

10:24.424 --> 10:26.958
All right, hey!
Come on!

10:28.261 --> 10:30.261
And... action!

10:32.432 --> 10:34.766
Huh? Huh?

10:34.768 --> 10:37.168
What can I do
to make you feel better, huh?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.770
You want me to breastfeed you?
Would that make you feel better,

10:38.772 --> 10:39.771
if I breastfed ya?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.507
Yeah? Here we go.
Let's try to...

10:51.251 --> 10:53.351
I'm-I'm sorry, guys.
I need to cut. Uh...

10:53.353 --> 10:54.919
Sorry, everybody.
A little technical difficulty.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.656
Who wants
a t-shirt?

10:57.658 --> 11:00.325
Hey, man.
What's up?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.927
I'm sorry. You know, I'm trying
to understand, for my character,

11:02.929 --> 11:05.930
you know, um, are-are
we suggesting, you know,

11:05.932 --> 11:09.100
that the man-NY thinks a grown
man can breastfeed a baby?

11:09.102 --> 11:12.170
Are we saying the man-NY's
got brain damage?
'Cause I could do a voice.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.273
Kevin, I know you care. I know
you care about the character.
I do care

11:15.275 --> 11:18.109
about the character. Thank you.
I also know that you're a
30-something-year-old actor

11:18.111 --> 11:20.945
whose biggest previous
role was a three-episode
arc on <i> Nashville.</i>

11:20.947 --> 11:23.615
So say the line or
find another job.

11:23.617 --> 11:26.284
Because trust me when I say
that I'll have you replaced

11:26.286 --> 11:28.219
by Ryan gosling, Ryan phillippe,
or Ryan Reynolds

11:28.221 --> 11:30.889
or any other handsome Ryan by
the time you get to your car.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.059
And believe me, my
ratings will go up.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.462
Ryan gosling would never do
this crap.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.830
You are right,
Kevin.

11:38.832 --> 11:42.000
Ryan gosling would never do
this crap.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.968
Remember that.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.908
Come on, Annie!

11:49.910 --> 11:51.476
Go get the ball, hon!

11:51.478 --> 11:53.578
Hi, daddy!

11:53.580 --> 11:55.914
Hi, sweetheart!
There's the ball!

11:55.916 --> 11:57.849
You want to play soccer?

11:57.851 --> 12:00.685
It...
How's she doing?

12:00.687 --> 12:03.755
Uh, I think she's saving
it for the second half.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.423
How's about her?

12:07.427 --> 12:10.161
Four boys crying
and counting.
That's my little bull dyke.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.564
Switch?
Switch.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.402
Is that a... aw.
French braid. Yes.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.572
Over, under,
back through, baby!

12:20.574 --> 12:23.074
Hi, mommy!
All right, well,
she made a friend.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.945
I found him.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.580
My father.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.582
What? When?

12:30.584 --> 12:32.951
I, uh... I hired a guy.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.019
It cost about 1,500 bucks.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.622
Now, I paid for it on the
amex. You're gonna see it.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.125
It's the personal amex, not
the business amex. I know,
i don't care about the amex.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.926
I know.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.128
So you're gonna...

12:43.130 --> 12:45.597
No.
Why not?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.932
Because she was a crack addict
who died during childbirth,

12:47.934 --> 12:50.101
and he was the guy who
left me at a fire station,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.904
probably because he couldn't
think of anything more clichÃ©.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.773
So why'd you find him?

12:56.042 --> 12:58.643
I don't know, Beth.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.146
I really don't know.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.918
Oh! Go!

13:06.920 --> 13:07.986
Way to go, Tess!

13:07.988 --> 13:09.821
Sportsmanship, baby!

13:27.174 --> 13:28.940
Excuse me.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.842
Do you mind?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.355
...and so, I said
to myself, "Tanya,

13:44.357 --> 13:46.658
"you have done what you have
set out to do.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.493
"You have lost the weight.

13:48.495 --> 13:53.264
And now you can help others
be skinny like you."

13:56.269 --> 13:58.770
So, who would like
to share first?

13:58.772 --> 14:01.339
Every time I'm going on a diet,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.141
he sabotages me.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.610
Well, my husband found me
eating out of the fridge

14:05.612 --> 14:08.279
in the middle of the night
again the other night.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.649
I'm trying.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.452
I'm not sabotaging
you, Marsha.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.388
I know I don't have the same
issues as everyone here.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.825
But you guys don't know what
it's like looking like me

14:20.827 --> 14:23.228
and carrying around that extra
seven pounds in your midsection.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.502
For me,

14:31.504 --> 14:33.571
it was my mom.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.240
She never let us eat pizza.

14:35.242 --> 14:39.177
And so now, every time
i see a pizza,

14:39.179 --> 14:42.013
I mean, I have to eat
the entire thing.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.182
If this doesn't work,
i might just

14:44.184 --> 14:46.985
have my stomach stapled
and just be done with...

14:51.224 --> 14:54.225
I am sor... I'm sorry.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.528
I was just-- I was picturing
the stapler.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.163
And it's--

14:59.165 --> 15:01.566
which is totally inappropriate.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.502
I apologize.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.937
I'm way fatter than you if it...

15:05.939 --> 15:07.238
Means anything.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.616
Mmm, coffee.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.585
Hi.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.123
Boy, these people hate me.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.925
You kind of crossed the line.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.294
Yeah, you laughed.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.362
That's because i
live across the line.
Oh!

15:31.364 --> 15:33.698
Okay.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.933
Toby.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.301
Kate.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.568
Yeah.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.970
Nice to meet you.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.239
So, you want to be fat friends?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.410
Sure.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.545
But I'm gonna
lose the weight.
You know,

15:47.547 --> 15:50.214
I'm probably not.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.150
Okay.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.157
I can't fall
for a fat person right now.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.760
Well...

16:02.762 --> 16:04.162
I guess I'll lose
the weight then.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.303
Breathe, bec. Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.272
Breathe. Breathe.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.673
Deep breath, bec.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.008
Deep breath, deep breath.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.444
Deep breathe, look
at me, deep breathe.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.812
There you go.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.313
There you go, almost done,
almost done.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.318
There you go.
Hey, there you go.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.321
Baby, I'm sorry for anything I'm
gonna say in the next two hours.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.923
I mean none of it.

16:31.925 --> 16:34.325
You're gonna mean some of it.
Very little of it.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.161
Fair enough.
I'm almost glad Schneider's
appendix burst.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.429
I like you two.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.598
Now since I'm new here,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.800
I thought we might have
a conversation now

16:42.802 --> 16:44.936
before things get
more intense.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.038
Yeah, that sounds nice.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.606
So, you said
you have grandchildren?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.274
Not that kind of conversation.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.443
Now. I know that Dr. Schneider
talked to you about

16:52.445 --> 16:53.878
the positioning of the babies,

16:53.880 --> 16:56.214
and how complicated
this delivery could get.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.950
I thought we should...
I'm sorry, no, we're not gonna
have this conversation.

16:58.952 --> 17:01.386
Jack, we need to have this...
We're not having
this conversation

17:01.388 --> 17:03.654
because it's not gonna happen.
Well, we need to talk about...

17:03.656 --> 17:05.123
We are walking out of this
hospital with

17:05.125 --> 17:07.058
three healthy babies
and one healthy wife.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.659
Absolutely, but we still...
I have three cribs

17:08.661 --> 17:10.161
at our new home

17:10.163 --> 17:12.063
that we bought specifically

17:12.065 --> 17:14.565
for our three children
to grow up in.
I understand.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.635
My-my mother, my mother has
already knitted three onesies.
I know.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.738
And she's a slow,
no-talent knitter.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.406
It's also happens to be
my birthday today,

17:22.409 --> 17:24.509
which tends to be

17:24.511 --> 17:26.978
a pretty great day in our house,
a day when I get pretty lucky.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.848
So I'm gonna need everyone
in this room to believe me

17:30.850 --> 17:34.919
when I say that only good things
are gonna happen here today.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.487
Actually...

17:36.489 --> 17:39.590
I-i don't just want you
to believe it.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.360
I want you to know it.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.961
Do you know it, baby?

17:45.231 --> 17:47.398
I love you.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.167
Yeah, I know it.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.301
I know it.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.004
Do you know it, doc?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.810
I know I like you.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.981
Let's just start there,
get you what you want.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.685
Okay.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.459
Hey, clear my afternoon?

18:14.461 --> 18:17.662
But sir, what about--?
Thanks.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.147
Yeah, yeah.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.915
Stop all that banging,
i heard you the first time,

18:37.917 --> 18:39.150
banging on the door.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.751
Who the hell is...

18:40.753 --> 18:43.588
My name is Randall peasing.
I'm your biological son.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.257
36 years ago you left me
at the front door...

18:46.259 --> 18:48.493
No, hold on, just
let me say this.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.230
36 years ago you left me at the
front door of a fire station.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.431
Now, don't worry,
I'm not here

18:53.433 --> 18:54.599
because I want
anything from you.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.268
I was raised by two
incredible parents,

18:57.270 --> 19:00.271
I have a lights out
family of my own, and...

19:00.273 --> 19:02.807
That car you see parked out
in front of your house?

19:02.809 --> 19:06.444
Cost $143,000 and
i bought it for cash.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.447
I bought it for cash
because I felt like it,

19:09.449 --> 19:11.582
and because I can
do stuff like that.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.919
Yeah, you see, I turned
out pretty all right.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.621
Which might
surprise a lot of folks

19:16.623 --> 19:18.656
considering the fact
that 36 years ago

19:18.658 --> 19:21.959
my life started with you leaving
me on a fire station doorstep

19:21.961 --> 19:24.095
with nothing more
than a ratty blanket

19:24.097 --> 19:26.430
and a crap-filled diaper.

19:26.432 --> 19:30.835
I came here today so i
could look you in the eye,

19:30.837 --> 19:34.272
say that to you, and then
get back in my fancy-ass car

19:34.274 --> 19:37.108
and finally prove
to myself, and to you,

19:37.110 --> 19:38.442
and to my family who loves me,

19:38.444 --> 19:40.945
that I didn't need
a thing from you,

19:40.947 --> 19:43.214
even after I knew who you were.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.950
You want to come in?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.885
Okay.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.997
So is there something
you want to say to me?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
'Cause otherwise, i
really need to get going.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.668
You want <i> me </i>
to say something?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.469
No, I told you, I don't
want anything from you.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.572
But you're here.
Just to tell you that.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.473
Well...

20:09.475 --> 20:11.742
I've been told.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.812
You know what? If you're just
gonna sit here making excuses...

20:14.814 --> 20:17.248
Didn't make any excuses.
Because there's
nothing you can say.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.650
Didn't say anything
for just that reason.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.925
Seems to me you want <i> me</i> to try
to make amends so you can say,

20:27.927 --> 20:30.394
"screw you,"
and storm out of here.
That's ridiculous.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.797
Okay.

20:37.070 --> 20:40.705
I'd like to say
i remember that day, but...

20:40.707 --> 20:42.139
I barely do.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.710
I'm clean now, finally, but...

20:45.712 --> 20:48.079
I was on the streets then.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.083
I remember her dying,

20:52.085 --> 20:55.086
your mom,
remember the baby.

20:57.690 --> 21:01.425
I'd like to say I remember
leaving you at a fire station,

21:01.427 --> 21:02.927
but I don't.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.528
Not an excuse.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.931
In fact, it probably tells you
something about me

21:06.933 --> 21:09.667
that I don't remember.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.572
I do like fire stations, though,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.574
so that sounds
like something I'd do

21:16.576 --> 21:18.976
if I had to do something,
you know?

21:22.115 --> 21:24.582
Anyway, I don't know if that's
what you're looking for,

21:24.584 --> 21:26.417
but either way, you can be sure

21:26.419 --> 21:28.085
this life of mine
is punishment enough

21:28.087 --> 21:29.654
for the things I've done.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.256
If you think I'm
gonna forgive you...
I don't.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.924
No, you were right.
I did just want

21:33.926 --> 21:35.326
to say, "screw you,"
and storm out of here.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.396
Well, go ahead.
Screw you.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.830
Yup.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.507
You want
to meet your grandchildren?

21:51.611 --> 21:53.844
I'll get my coat.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.914
Hey, kid.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.916
Hey. Alan.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.418
All right. Hey, thanks
for doing this, man.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.919
Oh.
I really appreciate it.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.588
Oh, please.
No thanks necessary.

22:04.590 --> 22:08.259
Trust me: They're paying me
an absolute fortune.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.593
I'm sure.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.162
Great scene for you,
by the way.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.330
You know?
Yeah.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.331
Tell ya what, when
the prick wants to,

22:13.333 --> 22:14.332
he can actually write.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.133
Yeah. Well,

22:16.135 --> 22:17.635
I'll see you out there
on the playing field.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.270
All right.
Break a leg, kid.

22:19.272 --> 22:20.604
Thank you, sir.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.175
Hey!

22:24.177 --> 22:25.476
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:25.478 --> 22:26.944
the great Alan thicke!

22:26.946 --> 22:30.314
And... action.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.016
Oh, for God's sake,
I'm just trying

22:32.018 --> 22:33.651
to lighten up
the situation here.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.052
No, I get it.
That's what you do, right?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.053
My lightweight dad.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.488
Son...
Don't call me "son."

22:37.490 --> 22:38.489
Just go.
Just do your thing,

22:38.491 --> 22:39.490
get out of here.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.825
Come on, son...

22:40.827 --> 22:42.059
I said don't call me "son."

22:42.061 --> 22:44.495
I-i look at that little girl,

22:44.497 --> 22:47.231
I would do anything for her.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.733
You understand?
Y-you show me a train,

22:48.735 --> 22:51.836
I'll jump in front of it
for her, no question.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.838
And she's not even mine.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.574
I mean, you... you mosey
in and out of my life

22:56.576 --> 22:58.709
the past 30 years like
the way you have, i--

22:58.711 --> 23:00.745
I don't understand that
and I'll never understand you,

23:00.747 --> 23:02.313
so just get
the hell out of here.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.416
Just get out.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.755
I want you to get out
and this time,

23:10.757 --> 23:12.490
I want you to stay the hell
out of my life, okay?

23:14.327 --> 23:15.559
Son...
Leave!

23:23.236 --> 23:24.568
And cut!

23:33.413 --> 23:36.380
Thank you.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.582
All right,
they must think we did it.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.750
You did it.
Thank you.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.018
You were fa--
you killed.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.386
Thank you for being here.
Excellent.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.854
Hey, may I have
the envelope, please?

23:43.856 --> 23:45.423
Oh, come on.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.757
There, what are you doing,
come on, get in here.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.926
See, I told you, right?
I told you!

23:48.928 --> 23:50.027
That's so good, Kevin.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.028
Oh...
That felt good.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.096
Now all we need
to do is just

23:52.098 --> 23:53.364
take a quick whack
at the alt pass, huh?

23:53.366 --> 23:54.765
Oh, come on, we don't
need an alt pass,

23:54.767 --> 23:55.766
what are you talking about?
Why would you--

23:55.768 --> 23:56.767
wh-wh-what, for what?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.736
Kevin, come on,
we talked about this.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.405
You know? I loved it--
i-i wrote it, you know?

24:01.407 --> 24:05.075
But, um, we just got to,
we got to get a lighter version.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.577
Come on.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.412
Let's get that alt.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.814
For me, okay?

24:09.816 --> 24:11.749
And, uh, lose the shirt.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.718
It's just better
without the shirt.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.491
I hope you're hungry,

24:20.493 --> 24:21.792
'cause we got
some pizza for you!

24:23.596 --> 24:26.397
Everybody loves pizza!

24:34.140 --> 24:36.407
All right,

24:48.254 --> 24:50.154
No, it's okay. No, no.
Nobody be alarmed.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.755
Nobody be alarmed,
this isn't a real baby.

24:51.757 --> 24:52.756
This baby can't feel a thing,

24:52.758 --> 24:54.658
because everything's fake!

24:54.660 --> 24:57.161
God forbid we have real emotion
in this show.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.662
What do we got here?

24:58.664 --> 24:59.864
We got a real suitcase.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.599
Finally, we got something real.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.434
Oh, no, we don't! Look,

25:03.436 --> 25:05.469
there's nothing in the suitcase!

25:05.471 --> 25:07.605
Where the hell are you going,
Alan thicke?!

25:07.607 --> 25:09.807
And what the hell are you
gonna wear,

25:09.809 --> 25:11.942
when you get there?! Huh?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.611
He's got no clothes
in the suitcase!

25:13.613 --> 25:14.945
You know what it is,
I'm starting to think

25:14.947 --> 25:15.946
about things now.
It's actually-- Casey,

25:15.948 --> 25:17.114
it's not your fault, brother.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.115
It's not the writer's fault

25:18.117 --> 25:19.316
this show is so bad.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.386
And it's so bad!

25:22.388 --> 25:24.221
It's not the network's fault
for airing it!

25:24.223 --> 25:25.823
It's you guys!

25:25.825 --> 25:27.791
Why are you watching this stuff?

25:27.793 --> 25:31.128
It's your fault for demanding
so little of us

25:31.130 --> 25:32.229
that we settle.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.231
I can't feel my face right now,

25:34.233 --> 25:35.566
but you know what?

25:35.568 --> 25:37.501
I knew exactly what this job was
when I took it.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.537
Shame on me
for taking the money!

25:39.539 --> 25:41.505
Shame on you
for making me famous!

25:41.507 --> 25:43.307
Shame on all of us!

25:45.044 --> 25:46.410
That's enough.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.578
Hey...
What are you--?

25:47.580 --> 25:50.047
I'm not gonna hit you, man.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.682
I'm not gonna hit you!

25:51.684 --> 25:53.918
What do you-- you think
I'm some kind of animal?!

25:53.920 --> 25:55.252
I'm just gonna go nuts?!

25:55.254 --> 25:56.420
Listen,

25:56.422 --> 25:59.189
Ryan gosling may not
do this crap,

25:59.191 --> 26:01.425
and neither will I.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.930
I quit...

26:05.932 --> 26:07.464
I quit.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.169
Great working with you, man.
I'm a huge fan.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.972
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.083
All right, Rebecca,
one more big push, now.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.418
There you go...

26:27.420 --> 26:29.453
Keep pushing!
Come on, bec.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.588
All right!

26:30.590 --> 26:31.589
All right.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.424
First male is out,

26:33.426 --> 26:34.458
and he is looking good!

26:34.460 --> 26:35.626
You hear that, baby?

26:35.628 --> 26:37.061
We got a boy!
We got a boy!

26:37.063 --> 26:38.696
We got a boy!
All right.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.030
Thank you, ma'am.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.031
Baby?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.099
Something's not right.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.100
There's something's not right.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.201
Doctor?

26:44.203 --> 26:45.869
Some oxygen for her, please?

26:45.871 --> 26:49.039
Rebecca? You've done
real good, sweetheart,

26:49.041 --> 26:50.975
but we need to let you
get some rest right now

26:50.977 --> 26:52.543
and let's see if I can't
take it from here, okay?

26:52.545 --> 26:53.577
I'm sorry,
what's happening?

26:53.579 --> 26:54.578
I'm gonna have to go in

26:54.580 --> 26:56.080
for the other two,
people, let's go.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.748
Your wife is in distress, Jack.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.750
Now, right now,
you just need to trust me

26:59.752 --> 27:00.818
and get the hell out of my way.

27:00.820 --> 27:01.952
No, wait, but I'm...

27:01.954 --> 27:02.987
Get him out of the room, now.
- Stat.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.961
<i> Guys?</i>

27:10.963 --> 27:12.496
Hey, babe, I need you to
help Annie with her homework...

27:18.270 --> 27:19.837
Guys...

27:21.340 --> 27:23.807
...this is your, uh...

27:23.809 --> 27:24.842
William.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.610
This is William.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.312
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.313
William hill.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.582
Hi.

27:31.584 --> 27:33.984
I'm Beth. I'm sorry. I'm Beth.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.653
It's a pleasure
meeting you, Beth.
Mm.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.655
You have a hole in your pants.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.689
Annie!

27:38.691 --> 27:40.324
Oh, that's okay.
I actually do.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.660
Hey, isn't that
what the kids do to be cool?

27:42.662 --> 27:43.761
They put holes
in their pants,

27:43.763 --> 27:45.496
right?
Not like that.

27:45.498 --> 27:48.866
Well, here I was,
thought I was being cool.

27:48.868 --> 27:52.269
Wait, what if I do this?
Yo, what's going...

27:52.271 --> 27:53.771
No.
No.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.040
My, my, my,
you must be Tess.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.510
Yes.
I hear you play soccer...

27:59.512 --> 28:01.011
I should have called.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.446
I didn't know how
to say it out loud.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.114
So, you just...
I...

28:04.116 --> 28:05.783
I have no explanation,
baby.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.052
Like, everything I want to say

28:08.054 --> 28:09.386
or do around this man,
i do the opposite.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.455
It's like a bad sitcom.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.390
It's like an episode
of <i> the man-NY</i>

28:13.392 --> 28:15.559
or <i> what's happening!! </i>

28:17.563 --> 28:19.229
E left me at a fire station

28:19.231 --> 28:21.165
and I invited him into our home.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.303
Oh, my God, baby,
you're cracking up.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.405
Daddy?

28:28.407 --> 28:29.673
What's happening?

28:29.675 --> 28:32.910
What's happening?

28:38.584 --> 28:41.018
You're not serious.
I am.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.086
Wait, Sally field?

28:42.088 --> 28:43.420
Yeah. I have a thing
mm.

28:43.422 --> 28:46.590
For Sally field. Sue me.
She's, like, 60.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.059
60 is the new sexy.
You didn't know that?

28:49.061 --> 28:51.395
Mm-mm.
Mm. And when she turns 70...

28:53.532 --> 28:55.032
Look out,

28:55.034 --> 28:56.734
Sally is gonna peak
in her 70s.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.001
Mm-hmm.
I promise you.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.503
Yeah...
- Can I interest you in dessert?

28:59.505 --> 29:02.005
Oh, no thanks.
Yes!

29:02.007 --> 29:03.006
No.
Yes.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.108
No.
Yes.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.175
No!
Yes.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.243
He was just asking

29:06.245 --> 29:07.444
if he could interest us
in dessert.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.779
I am saying that he can.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.914
I am very interested
in dessert.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.950
I am utterly fascinated
by dessert.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.752
Dessert is my life's work.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.920
So...

29:16.922 --> 29:18.288
We will just have the check,
please.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.257
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.925
I don't normally like Risotto,

29:21.927 --> 29:24.795
but if you put it in a ball
form, and-and deep fry it,

29:24.797 --> 29:26.130
I can eat, like,
a thousand of them.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.067
I had a really nice time
tonight, Toby.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.135
Thank you.
Yeah.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.136
Wait, what?
No, no, no.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.437
What, that's it?

29:33.439 --> 29:34.972
What do you mean?

29:34.974 --> 29:38.742
I mean, you're not gonna
invite me in for a...

29:38.744 --> 29:41.078
A nightcap or...

29:41.080 --> 29:42.079
A handy or something?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.282
Cute.
I am.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.984
Thank you.

29:46.986 --> 29:50.320
I did have a really nice time
tonight.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.331
Okay. You can come inside
for a water.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.833
All right.
A water.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.168
Uh-huh.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.435
We have already had
our six ounces of wine.

30:05.437 --> 30:06.436
I know.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.438
150 calories
per six ounce.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.973
Ooh.
Yeah.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.742
You keep counting calories,

30:11.744 --> 30:13.577
and you're gonna
really turn me on.

30:13.579 --> 30:14.578
Yeah.
Hmm.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.913
You want to know how many, uh,

30:15.915 --> 30:17.981
calories are in a sausage?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.450
Is-- but is it even legal?

30:20.452 --> 30:22.653
No. Not in this country.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.390
Do you want to fool around?

30:27.459 --> 30:28.692
I don't.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.228
Ah.
Uh...

30:32.264 --> 30:34.164
Okay.
No, I...

30:34.166 --> 30:35.399
No, i-i do.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.702
It's just been a long time

30:38.704 --> 30:40.370
since this has
even been an option.

30:40.372 --> 30:43.507
Hey. I know, I know.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.075
Um, you don't.

30:46.111 --> 30:49.513
I am 36.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.717
And, um...

30:53.719 --> 30:54.985
This...

30:56.021 --> 30:59.356
...is not a very pretty picture.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.557
It's okay.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.960
No, it's...
Hey, it's okay.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.563
Hey!

31:06.565 --> 31:07.564
Kevin, what the hell?

31:07.566 --> 31:08.732
Why don't you answer your phone?

31:08.734 --> 31:09.633
Uh...

31:09.635 --> 31:11.335
I was on a date.
Yeah, hi.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.470
Oh...

31:13.472 --> 31:15.639
This is... this is the funny
fat guy from fat class?

31:15.641 --> 31:17.241
Hi.
Uh, yeah,

31:17.243 --> 31:19.076
it's Toby, and it's
a support group, but yeah.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.911
Holy... wait,
are you the man-NY?

31:20.913 --> 31:23.013
Yes, I am, Toby.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.982
I... I was.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.083
Wait, what?
You didn't check

31:26.085 --> 31:27.851
your phone, Twitter,
Facebook, nothing?

31:27.853 --> 31:29.086
Why? Wha...?
Well, you should.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.355
Becau...
Okay, what
is hap...

31:31.357 --> 31:32.890
What is happening?
I want you to know

31:32.892 --> 31:34.424
you would've been
proud of me, okay?

31:34.426 --> 31:37.327
I was the picture of
artistic integrity.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.365
Could we do one
without your shirt on?

31:41.367 --> 31:44.001
Well, the big news in Hollywood
today is, of course,

31:44.003 --> 31:46.536
the man-NY's on-set meltdown.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.405
Think about this,
I'm like, you know,

31:48.407 --> 31:50.207
it's actually not
the writer's fault

31:50.209 --> 31:52.409
that this show is so awful.

31:54.380 --> 31:58.048
Wow. I actually kind of
feel bad for Alan thicke.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.716
Yeah.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.259
Rebecca's vitals are good.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.295
She's gonna be asleep
for a little while,

32:11.297 --> 32:14.031
but she's doing fine.
We're monitoring her closely.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.999
Okay.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.070
We lost the third baby, Jack.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.872
I'm-I'm very sorry.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.741
The, uh...

32:24.743 --> 32:28.578
Second baby is a girl,
very strong.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.814
The third baby was a little boy,

32:30.816 --> 32:34.384
but the, uh, umbilical cord
was cutting off his oxygen.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.987
He was stillborn.
Nothing anybody could've done.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.894
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm not processing anything.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.595
My wife?

32:45.597 --> 32:46.930
Is fine.

32:46.932 --> 32:49.900
And she'll be awake pretty soon.

32:49.902 --> 32:53.270
You have two beautiful,
healthy children, Jack.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.340
Boy and a girl.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.978
But we did lose the third child.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.125
I need to be with my wife.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.326
And you will be.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.328
But she needs to sleep now.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.130
But soon.
You just sit down.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.732
Sit. Sit.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.206
Okay if I keep you
company a second?

33:30.376 --> 33:32.009
Yeah.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.018
Okay if I...

33:41.020 --> 33:44.554
Try and say something
meaningful?

33:44.556 --> 33:46.056
Yeah.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.228
I lost my wife last year.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.796
Cancer.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.034
That's the reason
i still work so much at my age.

33:57.036 --> 34:00.437
Just... trying
to pass the time.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.143
We were married 53 years.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.648
Five children, 11 grandkids.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.851
But we lost
our very first child

34:15.853 --> 34:17.821
during the delivery.

34:20.092 --> 34:23.326
The reason I went into
this field, truth be told...

34:25.164 --> 34:28.732
...i have spent five decades
delivering babies.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.101
More babies than I can count.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.507
But there is not
a single day that goes by

34:37.509 --> 34:41.411
that I don't think
of the child I lost.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.313
And I'm an old man now.

34:51.190 --> 34:54.925
I like to think that <i> because </i>
of the child that I lost,

34:54.927 --> 34:57.427
because of the path that...

34:57.429 --> 34:59.896
That he sent me on,

34:59.898 --> 35:02.766
that I have saved
countless other babies.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.334
Yeah.

35:08.073 --> 35:10.240
I like to think
that maybe one day

35:10.242 --> 35:13.210
you'll be an old man like me...

35:16.415 --> 35:19.449
...talking a younger man's
ear off, explaining to him

35:19.451 --> 35:21.418
how you...

35:21.420 --> 35:26.590
Took <i> the</i> sourest lemon
that life has to offer...

35:26.592 --> 35:29.893
And turned it into something
resembling lemonade.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.764
If you can do that,
then you will still be...

35:34.766 --> 35:38.101
Taking <i> three</i> babies home
from this hospital.

35:38.103 --> 35:41.104
Just...

35:41.106 --> 35:43.740
Maybe not the way you planned.

35:46.845 --> 35:50.413
I don't know if that was
meaningful or senile,

35:50.415 --> 35:53.216
but I thought
it ought to be said.

35:56.755 --> 36:00.090
Your wife'll still be asleep
for a little while.

36:01.627 --> 36:04.027
Go see your babies.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.198
They're excited
to meet their father.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.004
I think maybe
they got a good one.

36:27.219 --> 36:30.520
Sorry. Just had
to put the girls down.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.022
These people,
they're your...

36:32.024 --> 36:33.523
My parents.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.592
Well, my adopted.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.495
They're my parents.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.397
You've been with them
your whole life?

36:40.399 --> 36:42.399
From the start.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.068
A fireman found me.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.738
He took me to the hospital,
and they were there.

36:48.740 --> 36:52.008
They said it felt meant to be.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.811
Just one of those
lucky breaks, I guess.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.181
A fire station.

36:58.183 --> 37:01.051
Gee, what a thing to have done.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.821
I should get going.
Maybe we could have you by

37:04.823 --> 37:06.489
every once...
No, I don't think
that's necessary.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.058
It's no pressure.
I just...
It's just that

37:08.060 --> 37:09.392
I'm...

37:09.394 --> 37:11.061
I'm dying, is all.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.830
You're sick?

37:13.832 --> 37:15.732
Dying, not sick.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.734
Sick was months ago.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.804
I'm toward the end,
fortunately.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.743
Uh... I don't know what to say.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.245
No, there's nothing
to be said.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.250
It was a kindness
you've shown me,

37:33.252 --> 37:35.919
letting me meet them.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.791
Your dad must've been
very proud of you.

37:53.472 --> 37:56.973
* let your heart be *

37:56.975 --> 37:59.542
* unchained *

37:59.544 --> 38:02.746
* let your skin be *

38:02.748 --> 38:04.614
* unstained *

38:04.616 --> 38:06.149
* let your road... *

38:06.151 --> 38:09.586
I cannot believe that
I'm drinking these calories.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.289
Since I just torpedoed
my career,

38:12.291 --> 38:13.757
I think you can afford an extra,

38:13.759 --> 38:15.258
you know,
100 calories or whatever.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.060
150.
It's 150.

38:20.832 --> 38:24.267
What if I'm not better
than <i> the man-NY?</i>

38:24.269 --> 38:28.171
What if I am exactly
"man-NY good"?

38:31.910 --> 38:34.311
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.917
Broadway.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.086
Can't sing.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.587
Porn.

38:44.589 --> 38:45.989
Yeah, maybe.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.593
I'm gonna get some
more of this red.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.197
I'm in so much trouble.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.199
I am screwed.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.601
Listen, okay, Kevin...

39:07.446 --> 39:09.846
Do you remember
what dad used to say?

39:09.848 --> 39:13.083
When something crappy
would happen to us?

39:14.786 --> 39:17.654
<i> Whenever we'd get down,</i>

39:17.656 --> 39:20.890
<i> whenever we felt like</i>
<i> life wasn't going our way?</i>

39:22.227 --> 39:23.560
Which one's yours?

39:23.562 --> 39:25.228
Um...

39:25.230 --> 39:26.229
Those two.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.731
Congrats!
Twins.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.833
Wow.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.068
How about you?
Which one's yours?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.737
None of 'em,
actually.

39:33.739 --> 39:36.072
Strangest damn thing.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.841
Someone left a newborn
at my fire station.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.977
I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him here.

39:49.321 --> 39:50.587
Smoke?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.555
No. Thank you.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.831
life's strange.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.566
Congratulations.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.069
Thank you.

40:17.949 --> 40:21.684
* watch me when
you call my name *

40:21.686 --> 40:23.920
come on, kev.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.422
You remember.

40:25.424 --> 40:26.723
What did he say?

40:26.725 --> 40:28.258
About the lemons?

40:28.260 --> 40:29.759
Hmm?

40:29.761 --> 40:31.060
"There's no lemon

40:31.062 --> 40:33.096
"...So sour...

40:33.098 --> 40:37.066
<i> ...That you can't make</i>
<i>something resembling lemonade."</i>

40:37.068 --> 40:40.470
* So glad you came *

41:13.972 --> 41:17.207
* watch me when
you look my way *

41:19.277 --> 41:21.411
* see me smiling *

41:21.413 --> 41:23.680
* be my night and day *

41:23.682 --> 41:26.316
good. Now that's
out of the way.

41:26.318 --> 41:29.252
* Touch me in
your own sweet way *

41:29.254 --> 41:32.255
* feel me tremble *

41:32.257 --> 41:36.593
* when you take my words away *

41:45.103 --> 41:48.104
* all of the time *

41:48.106 --> 41:49.572
* I love you *

41:50.942 --> 41:52.876
* say it in mine *

41:53.305 --> 41:59.945
