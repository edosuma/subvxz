WEBVTT

00:15.482 --> 00:18.550
- I haven't seen anyone

00:18.552 --> 00:22.021
outside of work and
therapy, not for weeks.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.396
I haven't talked to my parents.

00:33.299 --> 00:37.069
We've texted here and there.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.604
But that's it really.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.675
I'm going to hate
text messaging.

00:45.412 --> 00:48.747
When it comes to
conversations about real life,

00:53.153 --> 00:55.187
what the fuck is a text anyway?

00:55.189 --> 00:58.057
Except a way to get
what you want and need

00:58.059 --> 01:01.260
without having to earn
the right to a response.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.500
I don't know what's
going on with me.

01:08.502 --> 01:12.704
I don't even know myself.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.174
I don't know if I should care.

01:29.322 --> 01:32.224
I haven't consistently, no.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.128
- Why not?

01:39.466 --> 01:42.434
You don't have a reason?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.803
- I'm sure there must be one.

01:44.805 --> 01:48.140
- What's the first
thing that comes to mind?

01:48.142 --> 01:50.576
- That it's boring.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.245
It's tiring.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.514
It hurts my hand.

01:55.516 --> 01:58.350
- It hurts your hand?

01:58.352 --> 02:00.385
- When I write for a long time,

02:01.654 --> 02:02.855
I don't hold my pen right.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.424
I hold it like a fork.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.695
- And there's no other
way you can do it?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.231
- What do you mean?

02:12.233 --> 02:15.567
Like type it all out,
save it to a folder?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.236
- Yeah, why not?

02:17.238 --> 02:18.504
Whatever.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.472
- It still just seems boring.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.841
I can't keep it up for
more than a few days

02:22.843 --> 02:26.178
at a time.

02:28.882 --> 02:33.852
- So you're bored with efforts
to communicate with yourself?

02:40.593 --> 02:43.495
Are other people
usually bored by you?

02:44.631 --> 02:47.332
When you talk with them?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.637
- No, not usually.

02:55.875 --> 02:59.545
Maybe you could think
about some more interesting ways

02:59.547 --> 03:03.916
to keep this record of your
feelings from day to day.

03:55.635 --> 03:59.304
- It is important for me to
journal right now, I know that.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.006
I accept it.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.775
It is essential that
I learn to reflect.

04:06.879 --> 04:09.681
So this is me, reflecting

04:11.384 --> 04:13.719
In a way that's more
appropriate to the current age.

04:16.356 --> 04:19.992
But is it better?

04:19.994 --> 04:22.527
Writing by hand is
archaic, I know this

04:22.529 --> 04:25.397
to be a true feeling,
I have vetted it.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.634
I am doing this
not as a means of

04:28.636 --> 04:31.837
finding an excuse not
to journal, but as

04:31.839 --> 04:35.841
part of an experiment,
an adaptation.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.014
Feels different.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.618
I don't know if it's different
in necessarily a good way,

04:46.620 --> 04:49.288
but I don't not know either.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.042
Not sad tonight.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.744
So that's a plus.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.747
Except

05:16.816 --> 05:18.350
because I'm not sad I don't know

05:18.352 --> 05:20.585
what else I'm feeling either.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.855
That doesn't mean I'm
happy, just because

05:23.857 --> 05:25.924
I said I'm not sad.

05:30.029 --> 05:34.333
Maybe this is an excuse to
not write my feelings out.

05:34.335 --> 05:37.469
Maybe I'm just indulging my own
personal form of television.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.440
Maybe I'm just years late

05:41.442 --> 05:43.675
to the YouTube impulse,
only I'm not even

05:43.677 --> 05:46.411
doing it right,
because it's just me.

05:47.647 --> 05:48.814
Not watching.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.718
Maybe I'm on to something here.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.421
Maybe this is the
next best thing

05:56.423 --> 05:58.457
in media entertainment.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.627
Soon, we'll all be staring
into our own cameras

06:02.629 --> 06:05.030
talking to ourselves
alone in our homes.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.036
It's like the worst
mirror in the world.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.672
One that remembers.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.446
I don't know, mirror,
nothing happened today.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.916
Nothing worth talking about.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.388
I clicked around the
internet all day,

06:29.390 --> 06:32.591
did maybe an hour's
worth of work,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.726
got praised for it.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.432
This little entry
is hardly worth

06:40.434 --> 06:42.000
the cost of data storage.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.840
You hear that, mirror?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.776
You're a waste today.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.511
You're worthless.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.019
It's already getting
significantly colder out,

07:01.021 --> 07:03.989
but I wanted to be out here.

07:05.658 --> 07:09.995
I feel better out here.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.865
The city seems quiet.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.902
Almost peaceful
when you look at it

07:16.904 --> 07:18.970
from just a few floors up.

07:21.574 --> 07:24.843
It's neither, though, obviously.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.616
It's weird

07:31.618 --> 07:33.452
that we don't talk
about it anymore,

07:33.454 --> 07:37.856
all the noise and the
conflict and the pain.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.762
I guess we're used to it.

07:46.833 --> 07:50.035
There's some joy too, I suppose.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.105
But that might be harder to see.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.544
Maybe I'm just not
looking closely enough.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.260
I'm angry.

08:15.262 --> 08:19.264
I'm angry that I can't
just go away somewhere

08:19.266 --> 08:21.833
and fix all of my problems

08:23.102 --> 08:26.705
I'm angry that a lot of
them aren't even my fault.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.940
I know I'm underdeveloped
emotionally,

08:28.942 --> 08:30.675
but what about the
world that chewed me up

08:30.677 --> 08:34.011
and spit me out into
this moment, huh?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.847
I mean, how fucked up
is it that I resorted

08:35.849 --> 08:39.017
to talking to
myself into a camera

08:39.019 --> 08:43.822
in order to stay grounded
between therapy sessions?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.525
How fucked up is it
that I still think

08:46.527 --> 08:48.193
this is good idea?

08:55.968 --> 08:57.636
I know what this is.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.308
This is the only way
for me to be able to

09:03.310 --> 09:06.978
delineate between what is
real and what I am imagining.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.117
So it's a crutch.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.620
So what?

09:17.823 --> 09:20.091
This is better than
doing it to a person.

09:25.097 --> 09:28.900
An unconscious, unfeeling
machine is not capable

09:28.902 --> 09:32.137
of being hurt by my bullshit,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.876
and it doesn't judge.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.614
Yeah.

09:44.016 --> 09:46.351
A mirror that remembers
but does not judge.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.260
Maybe there's some
value in that.

09:58.698 --> 09:59.965
I don't know what's
going on with me.

09:59.967 --> 10:04.703
I don't even know myself.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.838
I don't know if I should care.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.147
Cass keeps trying
to get in touch.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.086
She's not giving up.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.626
But what the fuck am
I supposed to say?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.194
I'm sorry I've been
out of touch but I've

10:29.196 --> 10:31.796
pulled myself apart and
I don't know what to

10:31.798 --> 10:33.932
make of what's left.

10:35.134 --> 10:40.105
What's the difference anyway?

10:40.107 --> 10:43.775
I have to go through this alone.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.118
It's not completely true.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.727
I'm going to talk
to Cass, I'm going,

11:02.729 --> 11:04.262
I'm going to end it.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.001
I stopped communicating
with people.

11:14.807 --> 11:18.176
I'm afraid of what
they'll think of me

11:19.245 --> 11:21.179
as I actually am.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.922
I wanted to record a quick entry

11:32.224 --> 11:34.259
before I fell asleep.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.265
Cass let me borrow
Zelda for the weekend.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.204
I called her.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.741
That's why I'm so tired.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.210
We spent the whole
day out at the park

11:52.212 --> 11:54.379
and we talked for hours.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.118
I told her what's
been going on with me.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.957
She's known that
I've been in therapy

12:05.959 --> 12:07.258
and she's known for
longer than that

12:07.260 --> 12:09.127
that I'm

12:12.131 --> 12:15.300
that I've struggled.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.371
That I'm a little damaged.

12:22.842 --> 12:25.110
But she didn't know...

12:34.854 --> 12:36.955
It's good that I reached out.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.190
I'm never alone,

12:39.192 --> 12:42.293
even if I feel
that way sometimes.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.232
I know that on a
reasonable level,

12:47.234 --> 12:51.336

14:13.854 --> 14:14.853
- I want wine.

14:14.855 --> 14:15.887
It's a wine kind

- You're...

14:57.430 --> 14:59.364
- Margaret.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.265
- Writer, right?

15:00.267 --> 15:01.299
- Yeah.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.400
Sometimes.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.569
- Yeah, Brett.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.238
- I remember.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.606
- Yep.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.576
My wife is grabbing
a table in the back

15:11.578 --> 15:13.044
if you wanna join.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.179
It's gonna get pretty
slammed in here later.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.181
- I'm meeting a friend.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.383
- Gotcha.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.352
Well, we're not on
a date or anything,

15:21.354 --> 15:23.922
so we're meeting friends
too if you change your mind.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.590
- Okay.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.393
- You should totally hang.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.497
- Hi.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.699
- Hey, who are you?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.134
- This is Brett.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.335
- Hi.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.104
I was just inviting
Margaret to come join

15:40.106 --> 15:42.440
me and my wife in the back.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.409
A few other friends are coming.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.377
- Cool.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.545
Let's do it.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.579
Okay?

15:48.581 --> 15:49.514
- Sure.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.215
- Cool.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.117
- I'm gonna go put my shit down.

15:54.688 --> 15:55.688
- Sure.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.362
- It's the first coat he
ever bought for himself

16:04.364 --> 16:05.463
as an adult.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.433
- I bought the last
one you replaced

16:08.435 --> 16:12.170
who probably bought all the
others ones before that.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.238
- I picked some out.

16:15.141 --> 16:15.740
I have bought a coat.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.108
- I don't believe you,

16:17.110 --> 16:18.443
but it sounds like
you're just a Ken doll.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.645
- I picked the red one,
the one we just donated.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.313
- The ugly ski jacket.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.249
- It's not ugly, and plus
it was only 15 bucks.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.284
- One more.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.754
- Someone paid you 15
bucks to take it from them?

16:29.756 --> 16:30.722
- One more, Margaret.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.423
- No.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.545
- He'll keep up this refrain
all night if you let him.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.127
- Yeah, it's Friday!

16:36.129 --> 16:36.995
- Friday.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.629
It's Friday!

16:38.631 --> 16:40.064
- It's Friday.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.299
- Cheers.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.702
- Yeah I don't
have anything, guys.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.237
Yay.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.372
- Two more, two more.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.339
- Two more!

16:48.341 --> 16:49.674
- Okay!

16:51.443 --> 16:52.643
- Come on girls, Taco Time.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.678
Taco Time.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.247
- Oh ho, so Taco Time!

17:09.395 --> 17:12.195
- How am I supposed to
know what you look like?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.398
Oh, of course.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.501
Of course you do them.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.469
Okay, fine.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.456
- Hi, good morning.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.125
Can I help you
find a table or...

17:47.332 --> 17:48.833
- Did you eat?

17:51.437 --> 17:53.204
- Did I eat?

17:53.206 --> 17:55.339
- Yeah, I waited just
in case you hadn't.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.675
I didn't want to be rude.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.212
- is this table
okay for you both?

18:01.214 --> 18:03.081
- Um, yeah.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.515
Sorry.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.718
- Nothing to be sorry about,
would you like a menu?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.420
- I know what I want,
she can use mine.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.422
- Okay, great, so
I'll be back in a bit.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.659
Would you like a beverage,
something to start with?

18:14.661 --> 18:17.562
- Coffee's really good.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.163
- Yeah, it totally is.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.132
- Yeah, I know.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.669
I'll have a coffee and
some water, please.

18:26.338 --> 18:27.505
- Great.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.609
- Why do you want
to eat with me?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.612
- I don't know.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.614
- Can I have my bag please?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.649
- Yeah, of course.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.194
I don't mind if
you wanna check it.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.866
- I only really care
about the computer

18:54.868 --> 18:57.768
which I know must be in
there, and the files on it.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.738
The ones that you decided
it was okay to watch.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.378
- Well if I hadn't, it
might not have become

19:07.380 --> 19:09.480
so important to me to
get it back to you.

19:14.419 --> 19:18.689
- Here we go, a coffee,
and water for everyone.

19:23.862 --> 19:26.597
Do you need another minute?

19:26.599 --> 19:29.200
- Yeah, I think so.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.835
- No problem at all.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.553
- If it makes you
feel more comfortable,

19:48.555 --> 19:50.922
I feel the same way you do.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.359
About a lot of stuff.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.201
Like the stuff you said,
really resonated with me.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.476
I'm sorry I watched your videos.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.755
- It's okay.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.799
Guess it could have gone worse.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.467
- Yeah.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.971
Some asshole could
have found them.

20:51.783 --> 20:55.820
When you talk about therapy,
and stuff like that,

20:58.023 --> 20:59.790
is that a...

21:03.295 --> 21:05.596
Where do you go to find
out about stuff like that?

21:06.632 --> 21:10.368
- I went through my insurance.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.571
- Of course.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.708
- Not all therapists
take insurance.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.810
Many don't actually.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.947
They get tired of insurance
companies trying to tell them

21:22.949 --> 21:25.950
how to do their job and
how much people are worth.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.922
The point is that you don't
have to have insurance.

21:34.526 --> 21:37.328
- Some people just pay?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.729
- I guess so.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.698
I don't know.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.668
I probably wouldn't
be able to afford it.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.003
Not twice a week, at least.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.772
I have to.

21:52.778 --> 21:56.847
Is it something you
would be interested in?

22:00.886 --> 22:03.387
- I don't know, maybe.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.358
I thought about it
before, but I don't know

22:07.360 --> 22:09.827
where I'd find the time
or the money to do it.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.332
I've got student
insurance though,

22:14.334 --> 22:16.534
it's not too great
outside of school.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.704
- You could probably talk
to someone there, too,

22:19.706 --> 22:22.006
if you wanted.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.350
- What you do is
great too, though.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.952
I recorded my own
video blog after

22:34.954 --> 22:36.887
watching yours yesterday.

22:47.999 --> 22:49.767
I'm sorry.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.635
I know they're supposed to
be all private and stuff,

22:51.637 --> 22:53.070
and I shouldn't have
kept watching them

22:53.072 --> 22:54.905
but I couldn't help it.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.841
I go through the same
shit too, you know that.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.843
The same shit, for reals.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.799
- Um, thank you, V.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.034
- Sure, it's no problem.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.570
- It's a little strange
how it happened,

23:26.572 --> 23:29.907
but it was nice to meet you.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.777
- It's nice to meet you, too.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.612
And thank you.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.814
- For what?

23:36.816 --> 23:39.016
- You know, for talking
to me and eating with me,

23:40.852 --> 23:43.521
and for not being mad that
i watched all your videos.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.793
Unless you are mad.

23:48.795 --> 23:52.830
- I'm just a little
uncomfortable.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.999
- Right, I understand that.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.771
I can show you mine.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.007
If it would help, make it fair.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.578
- You would feel
comfortable doing that?

24:17.155 --> 24:19.123
- Oh my God!

24:19.125 --> 24:20.925
- Come inside, come inside.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.993
- Oh my God!

24:26.832 --> 24:28.732
So cute!

24:28.734 --> 24:29.834
What's her name?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.969
- Zelda

24:31.971 --> 24:34.672
My friend loaned her to
me for a couple of days.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.806
- Good friend?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.575
- Uh-huh.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.047
I actually have to walk her.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.588
- They're beautiful.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.959
My mom used to hoist
me onto their lawn

24:54.961 --> 24:56.994
to take pictures or something.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.797
Like after my penance.

25:00.932 --> 25:03.067
- You're Catholic?

25:03.069 --> 25:05.169
- Technically, I guess.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.938
You?

25:10.775 --> 25:12.643
- Same, technically.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.250
- You're not all white, are you?

25:21.020 --> 25:24.088
- Uh, how'd you know?

25:26.024 --> 25:27.658
You're a little
more exotic-looking

25:27.660 --> 25:31.061
than the white-white girls
that hang around here.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.832
You're really pretty though

25:34.834 --> 25:36.233
- Thank you.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.971
So are you.

25:43.141 --> 25:44.875
If you don't mind my saying.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.876
- You just didn't have to
say it because I said it.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.612
- Oh I wasn't...

25:51.082 --> 25:53.317
- I just don't try
to be pretty-pretty.

25:55.987 --> 25:58.589
- You're being kind
of hard on yourself

25:58.591 --> 26:00.257
if you don't my saying.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.160
- Maybe.

26:18.343 --> 26:22.846
- I could help you, if you
want, to find a therapist.

26:22.848 --> 26:25.082
If that's what you want.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.086
- You don't have to do that.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.021
- I know.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.691
But still, I you want, I could.

26:35.894 --> 26:37.828
- I'll think about
it, if that's okay.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.163
- Okay, okay.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.203
- Oh.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.038
I wish dogs didn't poop.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.174
- I wish that people
would accept that they did

26:50.176 --> 26:52.610
enough to pick up after them.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.045
- Fair point, fair point.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.016
Did you hear about
that mayor in Spain

26:59.018 --> 27:00.918
that hired all those
people to follow around

27:00.920 --> 27:02.753
the shittier people that
leave their dog poop

27:02.755 --> 27:04.254
and put it on their doorstep?

27:04.256 --> 27:05.789
- What?

27:05.791 --> 27:08.092
That's amazing.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.061
- Yeah, he got all
these young people

27:11.063 --> 27:13.831
to look out for it,
and they walk around

27:13.833 --> 27:17.001
and they just like follow
people when their dogs poop,

27:17.003 --> 27:20.671
pick it up, box it up, and
put it on their doorstep.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.973
- Nice.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.808
I like it.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.411
Serving some justice and
giving young people jobs.

27:30.382 --> 27:33.717
- Yeah, I guess.

27:33.719 --> 27:36.120
I guess I could be into that.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.189
You know, pick up a little
shit, make a little money.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.891
- Coffee's really good.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.360
- Oh, good, thanks.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.165
- The coffee at that
cafe's really good too.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.966
I'd never been there before.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.803
- Oh, their coffee's
better than this.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.771
- Maybe, but not by much.

28:27.773 --> 28:30.040
It's better than
what my mother makes.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.443
- There's a coffee
spectrum, I guess.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.722
You live at home?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.790
- Yeah.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.060
- You grew up here?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.395
- Yeah.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.996
You wanna watch the video?

28:52.998 --> 28:56.300
- Oh, um if you want
to show it to me still,

28:56.302 --> 28:58.202
that's okay.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.229
- Wanted to try this.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.270
When I watched Marge's
videos, they just seemed

29:33.272 --> 29:36.206
so real, you know?

29:38.243 --> 29:40.410
I don't know about this for me.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.218
I know I shouldn't have even
watched the first video,

29:48.220 --> 29:50.854
but it was right there.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.356
So personal.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.398
Told myself if I watched
it it would help me

30:01.400 --> 30:03.901
find out who it belonged to,

30:07.005 --> 30:08.272
and that was a lie.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.207
I didn't even know if I
was gonna give it back,

30:10.209 --> 30:12.176
'til I watched all of them.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.516
I did, I watched all of 'em.

30:25.256 --> 30:29.827
I feel bad, but I
don't, you know?

30:30.995 --> 30:32.362
I feel guilty.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.068
But it affected me, you know?

30:38.070 --> 30:40.103
It helped me.

30:49.447 --> 30:50.881
I'm gonna apologize
to her when I

30:50.883 --> 30:52.616
give her computer back.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.024
Maybe I'll tell her
about this, you know?

31:02.227 --> 31:03.594
Maybe she doesn't hate
me after she finds out

31:03.596 --> 31:05.395
I spied on her.

31:15.306 --> 31:18.475
I don't know about this, I
usually write when I'm upset.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.144
That's how I became a
writer in the first place.

31:22.113 --> 31:25.315
I like having that difference,

31:25.317 --> 31:28.919
like I don't like to
write without a reason.

31:30.622 --> 31:35.025
Like, I like writing about
a character that's me

31:35.027 --> 31:37.094
but isn't me.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.471
This is me though.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.378
Can't fight that fact.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.359
What am I supposed to do now?

32:09.361 --> 32:11.361
Talk about my feelings?

32:20.104 --> 32:21.605
How do I feel?

32:25.977 --> 32:27.644
Just fuckin' angry, you know?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.447
That's how I always
feel when I'm here.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.349
Just...

32:34.686 --> 32:36.520
I feel hopeless, i
feel like none of this

32:36.522 --> 32:38.989
even matters, it's
never gonna matter

32:38.991 --> 32:40.424
as long as I'm
still here with her,

32:40.426 --> 32:42.025
and I have to be with
her, at least until

32:42.027 --> 32:43.994
I'm finished with school.

32:46.564 --> 32:48.498
You know, fuck her
though, because I'm not

32:48.500 --> 32:52.436
going to give up, I'm just...

32:54.439 --> 32:57.474
If I'm going to give up my
dreams and my writing just to

32:57.476 --> 33:00.444
get a job and drop out
of school and move out

33:00.446 --> 33:02.446
before it's time for me to.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.581
What, just 'cause
she wants me to?

33:09.220 --> 33:12.189
I know how that'll
wind up for me.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.095
I get swallowed up,
I get swallowed up

33:18.097 --> 33:18.996
and I wouldn't make it.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.765
Not on my terms.

33:27.472 --> 33:31.575
I'm not stupid, I'm very smart.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.112
I'm smarter than
her, or at least

33:35.114 --> 33:37.014
I'm more honest than she is.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.382
I have that.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.250
I have that in me.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.253
- Another?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.355
- Yes please.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.739
How's your girlfriend, Ian?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.440
- She's okay.ú

34:37.443 --> 34:39.643
Run out of time for work,

34:39.645 --> 34:42.545
haven't really seen her lately.

35:21.552 --> 35:24.654
- I hope I'm not
weirding her out.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.125
She didn't seem to mind
or anything, just...

35:31.429 --> 35:33.597
It's nice to know that
she's out there, you know?

35:33.599 --> 35:35.899
Somebody like her
that doesn't judge me

35:35.901 --> 35:37.734
when I'm being me.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.841
Kind of would like to
hang out some more.

35:44.843 --> 35:48.178
Can I just ask her that?

35:56.587 --> 35:59.556
Who am I even
talking to right now?

35:59.558 --> 36:02.792
It's me, yeah it's me, but

36:07.165 --> 36:08.498
I'm not really there,
you're not real,

36:08.500 --> 36:12.269
you're not the ghost of me.

36:13.304 --> 36:15.705
You're not there, you just...

36:21.546 --> 36:25.215
On second thought, maybe
that is the definition of me.

36:26.817 --> 36:29.186
She's there but she's not.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.992
- Margaret!

37:08.994 --> 37:10.660
I'm recording this
video for you since

37:10.662 --> 37:13.396
that is what the cool
kids are doing these days.

37:13.398 --> 37:17.234
But for real, this is
an important message

37:17.236 --> 37:19.736
I have a mission for you.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.738
Zing pow!

37:21.740 --> 37:24.841
This bottle of wine is full
and look, there's more!

37:24.843 --> 37:28.245
Mags and Cass forever.

37:30.648 --> 37:31.982
Yes.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.251
I spent an impractical
amount of time on this,

37:34.253 --> 37:37.554
but I think that
illustrates my commitment.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.322
How is that for visual aid, huh?

37:39.324 --> 37:42.025
A visual aid you can drink.

37:42.027 --> 37:45.829
Once you let me into
your apartment, tonight.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.597
I don't expect
anything from you.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.667
We both know that our love
runs deeper than that.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.469
That it's pure.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.538
Pure even than the
age-old tradition

37:55.540 --> 37:57.741
of imbibing on the
grape in times of

37:57.743 --> 38:00.577
great personal upheaval.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.615
Are you still upheaved, my love?

38:05.617 --> 38:06.916
This is the question
i must have answered

38:06.918 --> 38:09.286
if I am to sleep on this night.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.856
This is my quest on
this noble Saturday.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.692
Don't deny me my quest

38:15.694 --> 38:17.894
I'll die of broken heart.

38:20.399 --> 38:23.400
Well maybe not, but I
still wanna come over.

38:23.402 --> 38:28.038
♪ It's a need I can't explain

38:30.641 --> 38:32.008
Text me, woman.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.714
There's a voice in your head.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.015
You've been hearing a
new voice in your head,

38:39.017 --> 38:40.750
but you want it though.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.685
- i told you, it's not...

38:41.687 --> 38:43.920
- Oh, I'm sorry.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.323
I was joking.

38:46.325 --> 38:47.791
- I just don't think that it's...

38:47.793 --> 38:48.992
- Oh, I was totally joking.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.094
- I just don't think
that it's funny.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.663
You told me that I can
open up to you and then...

38:53.665 --> 38:54.631
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.867
You're right.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.404
I'm actually a
little bit jealous.

39:02.907 --> 39:06.576
I know it's been
hard, but it's like,

39:06.578 --> 39:08.878
I've been witnessing
you change your life.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.682
I thought you were
awesome before, but now...

39:12.684 --> 39:14.384
- Don't try to flatter
me just to make up

39:14.386 --> 39:16.486
for hurting me.

39:18.556 --> 39:19.689
What?

39:23.627 --> 39:24.494
What?

39:24.496 --> 39:25.995
- Nothing.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.399
- I'm sorry.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.800
I didn't mean to...

39:30.802 --> 39:33.970
Look, I told you
you don't have to

39:33.972 --> 39:36.106
do all of this, I
know that I'm hard...

39:36.108 --> 39:37.674
- No, stop.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.542
You're fine.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.711
I just have to get
used to it, you know?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.713
It's new.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.648
- It's not something that
you have to get used to,

39:45.650 --> 39:47.450
it's me.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.485
- Okay.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.387
Fine.

39:50.389 --> 39:51.888
But you are saying
a lot of things

39:51.890 --> 39:55.859
you never said before and being
a little more honest lately,

39:55.861 --> 39:57.394
which is fine with me.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.662
It's even refreshing.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.834
I wanna do it too.

40:08.439 --> 40:09.773
- What?

40:11.409 --> 40:16.012
- I don't know if it's because
we're a little bit older,

40:16.014 --> 40:20.617
and maybe we're not
spending enough time

40:20.619 --> 40:22.552
with each other, or...

40:53.784 --> 40:55.919
- Hi.

40:57.588 --> 40:58.655
- Sorry.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.657
- You can come in.

41:00.659 --> 41:01.925
- Thanks.

41:13.571 --> 41:14.471
Hi.

41:14.473 --> 41:15.572
- Hi.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.507
I'm Cass.

41:19.677 --> 41:20.577
- I'm sorry.

41:20.579 --> 41:21.244
- What for?

41:21.246 --> 41:22.679
- It's fine.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.914
- I should have texted
you first or something.

41:31.188 --> 41:33.523
- Do you want some wine?

41:33.525 --> 41:34.858
- I don't wanna
interrupt your night.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.793
- Oh, you're totally fine.

41:37.628 --> 41:38.695
Tell her.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.831
- Of course, but do you drink?

41:41.833 --> 41:44.667
- A little.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.836
- I'm sorry, but I'm just
trying to be responsible here,

41:46.838 --> 41:48.605
but are you old enough to drink?

41:48.607 --> 41:49.839
- She's old enough.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.875
- To answer for
herself, you mean.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.713
Whatever you're
comfortable with.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.857
- I got in a fight with my mom.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.959
- I'm sorry to hear that.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.928
- She's just so fuckin' batshit.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.530
- Word, I hear that.

42:19.003 --> 42:20.904
Oh.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.939
I just did that.

42:24.275 --> 42:25.642
Sorry.

42:25.644 --> 42:27.143
- It's okay, I'm used to it.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.811
- What I meant to say is...

42:28.813 --> 42:31.114
- I just really don't wanna
talk about it right now.

42:33.284 --> 42:37.720
If you don't mind.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.988
I'm sorry I
interrupted your night.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.024
- It's totally okay.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.627
Let's talk about something else.

42:44.629 --> 42:46.029
How do you like the wine?

42:47.998 --> 42:49.699
- It's really good, actually.

42:49.701 --> 42:50.833
- Right?

42:50.835 --> 42:52.902
Marge says it's too tannic.

42:54.205 --> 42:55.972
- I don't know what that means.

42:55.974 --> 42:57.707
- Nah, that's okay.

42:57.709 --> 42:59.175
Neither does she.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.080
- Zelda's your dog, right?

43:04.082 --> 43:06.149
- Oh, that's right you met her.

43:06.151 --> 43:07.317
You watched her crap.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.160
She's sweet, right?

43:17.162 --> 43:19.996
- Yeah, yeah, she's sweet.

43:34.979 --> 43:38.081
I will definitely text
you first next time.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.183
- Sounds good.

43:40.185 --> 43:43.086
I would have told you
to come over anyway.

43:43.088 --> 43:44.754
- I know.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.124
- Are you

43:49.760 --> 43:52.295
going to be walking
into anything?

43:54.098 --> 43:55.665
- Usually.

44:06.844 --> 44:08.211
- I like her a lot.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.979
- Yeah.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.714
- She's tough.

44:11.716 --> 44:13.383
Like us.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.387
- As much as,

44:19.289 --> 44:23.860
as far as I've come

44:23.862 --> 44:26.029
since I first started
coming here, it's always

44:26.031 --> 44:29.332
just been me, you know?

44:29.334 --> 44:33.036
Out there, in the
world, not in here.

44:36.106 --> 44:39.308
And it's weird because I
know that she came to me

44:39.310 --> 44:42.345
because she feels safe, and that

44:44.748 --> 44:46.149
that feels nice.

44:47.718 --> 44:49.118
Feels good.

44:51.121 --> 44:53.389
We seem to share
a common trauma.

44:59.029 --> 45:03.833
But still there's this voice,
that old voice in my head

45:05.002 --> 45:08.204
telling me, protect yourself.

45:09.406 --> 45:11.007
Don't give too much of yourself.

45:11.009 --> 45:13.109
Don't take responsibility
for others.

45:14.478 --> 45:18.247
But at the same time I don't
feel like I should listen

45:18.249 --> 45:21.084
to that voice anymore.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.321
- Why, why is that?

45:27.091 --> 45:29.792
- Because it's wrong.

45:29.794 --> 45:33.996
- Do you feel it's wrong.

45:33.998 --> 45:35.798
- I just said that.

45:35.800 --> 45:38.201
- Well yes, but,

45:38.203 --> 45:41.137
to me it appears you're

45:42.272 --> 45:43.473
unsure.

45:43.475 --> 45:45.441
- I'm not unsure.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.244
I'm just waiting
for confirmation.

45:51.982 --> 45:54.016
Which you're not
going to give me.

45:56.019 --> 45:59.355
- Well, even if I felt it
was the right thing to do,

45:59.357 --> 46:02.759
I'm still, I'm still
not completely clear

46:02.761 --> 46:05.995
on what it is you've decided.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.400
- Because I'm meandering?

46:13.270 --> 46:14.937
Are you surprised?

46:23.213 --> 46:26.382
I don't feel like I should
listen to that voice this time

46:27.551 --> 46:30.353
because,

46:33.257 --> 46:35.191
it's different.

46:36.126 --> 46:39.195
She's not asking anything of me,

46:39.197 --> 46:42.331
and I'm not offering
anything that I can't give.

46:45.569 --> 46:47.270
And I like her.

46:48.372 --> 46:51.908
- Well from what you've told me,

46:51.910 --> 46:54.877
seems as if there's
plenty to like so far.

46:55.879 --> 46:58.347
- Cass says she's tough like us,

47:02.519 --> 47:06.022
and I like the idea, you
know, of women helping women.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.494
Plus everybody
needs a place to go.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.299
- How about you?

47:16.301 --> 47:19.101
You have a place to go?

47:21.138 --> 47:23.272
- I just said it, here.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.275
- I mean, in your
day-to-day life.

47:28.245 --> 47:32.548
Is there, is there
somewhere or someone

47:32.550 --> 47:35.284
you can go to when
you need help?

47:38.322 --> 47:40.556
- I have Cass, I guess.

47:42.492 --> 47:43.960
- Okay.

47:52.102 --> 47:53.603
- What?

47:53.605 --> 47:56.906
- Well I'm just
wondering if you think

47:56.908 --> 47:59.308
maybe this new friendship
might have something

47:59.310 --> 48:01.644
to offer you, as well.

48:04.648 --> 48:08.351
- I would think so.

48:08.353 --> 48:10.253
- Can you identify how?

48:10.255 --> 48:12.455
Or what it is that
you might get?

48:17.394 --> 48:19.929
- What I could get
out of friendship?

48:30.040 --> 48:31.474
- Hi Cass.

48:34.044 --> 48:35.544
You're super-bored.

48:37.915 --> 48:42.184
And a little bit
lonely, so here you are

48:42.186 --> 48:44.520
copying your
friend's weird idea.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.393
I don't really get it.

48:51.595 --> 48:54.330
I guess we're supposed to
talk about our feelings.

48:58.268 --> 49:00.136
Does hungry count?

49:02.507 --> 49:05.007
- I don't even know
why I'm laughing,

49:05.009 --> 49:07.376
it's not funny, but I...

49:12.215 --> 49:16.085
It's just, it's so
beautiful out today,

49:16.087 --> 49:21.090
and I feel open.

49:25.028 --> 49:27.330
You know, like there's not
anything to worry about.

49:28.465 --> 49:31.400
At least not now,
not in this moment.

49:33.603 --> 49:37.139
And yeah, I want that.

49:39.476 --> 49:41.143
I want that to last.

49:45.749 --> 49:48.217
I'm gonna go out.

49:48.219 --> 49:51.354
I'm gonna go out and

49:51.356 --> 49:54.457
just go to the cafe
and have some lunch

49:54.459 --> 49:57.026
and be lazy.

50:11.441 --> 50:15.578
- I'm glad it works for Marge.

50:17.047 --> 50:19.315
She seems to be doing
really well these days.

50:20.250 --> 50:21.584
She's like, stable.

50:22.753 --> 50:25.421
She's always been
stable on the surface,

50:25.423 --> 50:28.190
but not like this.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.427
I get it.

50:32.462 --> 50:35.097
She's showing up
for herself more.

50:39.469 --> 50:41.604
I miss her a little bit.

50:43.306 --> 50:45.474
She still hasn't
been around as much.

50:46.810 --> 50:50.179
At the same time, I'm
starting to feel closer to her

50:50.181 --> 50:52.281
when I do see her.

50:53.351 --> 50:56.752
Maybe I should talk
to someone too.

50:56.754 --> 50:59.622
I'm fine, but you know...

51:21.279 --> 51:25.548
I guess I'm starting to
understand how this works.

51:27.784 --> 51:29.452
It's a little devious.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.554
Margaret would come up
with something like this.

51:35.125 --> 51:36.826
I have to keep
looking at myself.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.766
You know, when I don't talk,

51:43.768 --> 51:47.136
it keeps listening, so I have to

51:47.138 --> 51:50.639
keep talking

51:51.575 --> 51:53.409
to myself.

51:54.411 --> 51:55.878
Touche, Marge.

52:08.525 --> 52:12.628
I just feel,

52:16.399 --> 52:18.434
I feel

52:20.504 --> 52:24.273
really overwhelmed sometimes.

52:25.542 --> 52:28.344
Everything I do,

52:29.546 --> 52:30.479
I just do it.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.581
I'm all doer.

52:33.617 --> 52:35.417
I get up and I go,

52:35.419 --> 52:37.753
and I go out

52:37.755 --> 52:40.723
and I hang out

52:40.725 --> 52:42.658
and I stay out,

52:42.660 --> 52:44.627
but...

52:45.829 --> 52:48.831
Now I know I have plenty
to be happy about,

52:48.833 --> 52:53.169
and I just feel,
fuck, even right now

52:53.171 --> 52:55.204
I know I can just turn
this off and go find

52:55.206 --> 52:57.706
something to make me happy, but

53:02.879 --> 53:04.647
Is that happy?

53:19.829 --> 53:21.797
- Every fucking
time I say something

53:21.799 --> 53:24.300
about anything that
I'm happy about,

53:24.302 --> 53:27.736
she fucking shits all over it.

53:30.807 --> 53:33.242
Doesn't matter what I do.

53:33.244 --> 53:35.511
Doesn't matter
what I fucking say.

53:38.615 --> 53:40.916
- I feel like I can burst

53:44.221 --> 53:45.788
sometimes.

53:46.990 --> 53:48.791
I feel like I could

53:49.893 --> 53:53.329
destroy something, or someone.

53:57.567 --> 53:59.802
I noticed a few men have
been on the wrong end

53:59.804 --> 54:01.971
of that compulsion.

54:05.942 --> 54:07.810
Fuck.

54:54.858 --> 54:56.659
- She didn't even let me
finish lettin' me tell her

54:56.661 --> 54:58.394
how many people actually
read the magazine

54:58.396 --> 54:59.728
before she skipped
to the end and just

54:59.730 --> 55:02.531
started in on me.

55:02.533 --> 55:04.800
I don't know about that
creative writing thing,

55:04.802 --> 55:07.670
because that ain't no real job.

55:07.672 --> 55:09.405
You ain't gonna
make no real money,

55:09.407 --> 55:12.574
and I ain't payin' all this
money for you to stay poor.

55:14.377 --> 55:16.345
- Parents worry.

55:19.716 --> 55:21.684
- She isn't even paying
all of my tuition,

55:21.686 --> 55:24.386
I earn that shit
through scholarships.

55:34.431 --> 55:37.900
Now I'm just continuing
this by yelling at you.

55:38.768 --> 55:40.469
- You're not yelling at me.

55:40.471 --> 55:42.404
Not like that at least.

55:43.807 --> 55:45.941
Besides, even if you were,
I'm pretty used to it.

55:52.482 --> 55:56.819
- I figured you
would understand.

55:56.821 --> 55:59.355
Still doesn't make
it right though.

56:06.796 --> 56:09.465
What in the world are
you smiling about?

56:10.834 --> 56:12.134
- I don't know.

56:13.436 --> 56:16.472
Maybe it's just because
I'm not sad right now?

56:17.640 --> 56:19.608
Not tonight, at least.

56:22.746 --> 56:24.113
- I don't wanna make you think

56:24.115 --> 56:26.582
I don't sympathize with you.

56:26.584 --> 56:30.085
- No, I, I don't
wanna be sad either.

56:32.155 --> 56:33.922
I'm angry, you know,

56:33.924 --> 56:36.024
but maybe underneath
that I'm a little sad,

56:36.026 --> 56:38.761
but I don't know, right
now I just don't feel it.

56:38.763 --> 56:42.431
- Good, then it's settled.

56:42.433 --> 56:44.633
No sadness.

56:45.702 --> 56:46.802
- Okay.

56:54.944 --> 56:56.912
- You wanna go outside
for a little bit?

56:58.848 --> 57:00.149
- Outside where?

57:04.521 --> 57:05.954
- Can I ask you something?

57:05.956 --> 57:07.823
- Yeah.

57:12.796 --> 57:15.130
- Are you safe?

57:16.966 --> 57:18.901
- Yeah.

57:20.003 --> 57:21.970
- Are you sure?

57:23.907 --> 57:25.040
I just felt like I should ask.

57:25.042 --> 57:27.009
- She doesn't hit me anymore.

57:35.885 --> 57:37.886
She's too scared of me.

57:44.961 --> 57:47.196
She created a monster, you know.

57:48.131 --> 57:49.731
I'm 10 times angrier than she is

57:49.733 --> 57:51.633
and I'd give it back to her.

58:03.947 --> 58:06.882
Couple years ago was the
last time she hit me.

58:11.254 --> 58:14.890
She started on me for some
bullshit reason or another,

58:17.160 --> 58:18.827
and I don't know something
was different that time.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.195
She...

58:22.165 --> 58:23.899
I just didn't back down.

58:27.871 --> 58:30.939
The first time in my
life I didn't back down,

58:30.941 --> 58:32.975
at least from her.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.049
Something in my just
snapped, you know?

58:41.051 --> 58:44.119
Just changed.

58:45.154 --> 58:46.255
That ever happen to you?

58:46.257 --> 58:47.723
- Yeah.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.531
- I wrote something about it,

58:55.533 --> 58:57.866
like a metaphor.

59:02.572 --> 59:06.008
I don't really like it and
it's not nearly good enough,

59:06.010 --> 59:08.010
but I'll tell it to you
if you want to hear it.

59:08.012 --> 59:09.811
- Okay.

59:18.888 --> 59:21.690
- You know how you have that

59:21.692 --> 59:25.227
that hard, bendable plastic,

59:25.229 --> 59:29.965
like one of those
little cheap black combs

59:29.967 --> 59:31.967
that's not gone through
the unbreakable,

59:31.969 --> 59:34.036
so they're actually breakable?

59:39.709 --> 59:41.076
What if you have
something like that

59:41.078 --> 59:42.945
and you just bend it?

59:44.847 --> 59:47.015
You bend it just
'cause it could bend?

59:53.823 --> 59:56.091
And you just keep bending
it 'cause you can,

59:56.093 --> 59:59.962
just back and forth,
back and forth.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.598
Maybe you start to
realize when you put

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.066
a little more pressure on it,

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:07.302
it becomes that weird
greyish-white color

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:09.037
and it weakens.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.311
But you don't stop, right?

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:19.915
You keep bending it
just 'cause you can.

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.020
And you keep goin', you
just go back and forth,

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:28.090
back and forth, and of course

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:31.660
you think yeah,
this is gonna snap,

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:34.696
it's gotta break, right?

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:40.268
But then you hear
that hard snapping.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:50.112
When you look down
the inside isn't soft,

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:52.114
it's like when you
have two sharp pieces

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:54.116
in your hand.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.987
Surprised though.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.293
That's how I felt.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.230
That's how I feel.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:14.703
And I'm just two broken
pieces in her hand.

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:24.312
She, she just got
angrier and angrier

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.748
and I didn't even say anything.

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.419
She said the worst things
that she's ever said.

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:39.728
I didn't back down though.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.263
Mm-mm.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.303
She didn't put her
hand on me either,

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:52.340
'cause I don't know what
it was, maybe it was

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:55.010
just something I said.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:02:01.483
I think I just looked
at her and I said,

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:04.820
you try to fucking hit
me again, old lady.

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:06.455
Just try it.

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:19.167
She said the worst things she's
ever said to me that night.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.437
She never put her
hands on me again.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:37.986
Sorry.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.454
- Don't be.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:49.064
I had a fight like
that once, too.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.836
With my dad.

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:55.804
- Good for you.

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:57.439
- No.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:01.309
It wasn't, it was never good.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.347
For anybody.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.154
- I see what you're saying,

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:15.190
but I don't completely
agree with you.

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.259
There is something I could do.

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:18.460
I can be there for you,

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.295
just like you're
always there for me.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:25.333
Probably do a better job
with that sort of stuff.

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:28.336
I know we can.

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:32.007
And I think we should.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.911
- What are you scheming?

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.114
- What makes you
think I'm scheming?

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:43.118
- Don't play games
with me, Cassandra.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.220
- Okay, there is something

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:47.355
I want to talk to you about.

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.091
- Are you okay?

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:53.094
- Oh yeah, no, I'm fine.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.163
I wanted to talk to
you about my lease.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.299
- Your lease, what about it?

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.568
- It's up in a
little over a month,

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:03.305
and I'm thinking of moving.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:06.041
- Oh yeah?

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:07.275
- Yeah.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.212
Ugh my God, I totally wanted to

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.448
talk to you about
this in person.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:16.318
And I know you
like living alone,

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.588
but other best friends live
with each other, Marge,

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:22.090
it's not a crazy proposition.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.125
- I know, I know.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:28.563
But, I thought that you
liked living alone, too.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.869
- Ah, it's losing its appeal.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.071
My whole lonely
lifestyle is rapidly

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:39.374
losing its appeal.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.245
It's not funny.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.347
- I'm sorry, I'm
not laughing at you.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:47.983
- You totally just
laughed at me.

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:50.218
Right in my face.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.387
If I had been recording
this, I'd have proof.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.521
And who says I'm not?

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.290
- Okay, okay.

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:56.591
I've stopped.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:59.261
- Right.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:00.462
I'm serious, though.

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:03.031
I wanna at least
live closer to you.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.233
I miss you, boob.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:08.303
- Living closer would
be fucking awesome.

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:09.504
- Right?

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:10.939
That doesn't mean
you're off the hook

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:13.041
with the roommate proposal.

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:14.943
I know you probably
need some time,

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:18.280
but I think that
should be option 1A.

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:20.015
- What about the commute?

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:22.450
- I'll be saving a
shitton in rent, Mags.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.419
I'll just buy some
paperbacks for the train.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.487
Screw that.

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:28.056
I'll steal 'em from you.

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:29.357
- They'd be given freely.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.395
- So you'd be cool
with at least that?

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:34.930
Me moving to your hood?

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:36.398
- More than cool with it.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.700
And I don't own the
neighborhood, so.

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.135
- Yeah, I can live
wherever I want.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.970
I don't need your
fucking permission.

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:44.606
I am serious about this.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.574
- I know.

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:49.077
- I wanna just

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:55.250
get my shit together
and like be.

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.321
I'm gonna read all your
smarty pants books,

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:02.657
at least half way, and

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:06.962
I'm gonna follow you to yoga
or meditation or whatever,

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.030
and I'm gonna start
buying organic and shit.

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:10.665
I'm gonna be your
happy hippy shadow.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:14.069
- Oh, hippies
don't cast shadows.

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:16.104
- They're like vampires?

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.639
- Vampires cast shadows, Cass,

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.040
they don't have reflections.

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:23.411
- Oh, but would a vampire shadow

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:25.981
be seen in a mirror?

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:28.450
And what about vampire hippies?

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.986
What do they eat?

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.554
- Beets?

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:35.457
- That makes no sense, Margaret.

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.392
- Yes it does.

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:40.528
- Soon we're going to be able
to be ridiculous in person.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.098
It's going to be great.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:05.487
- It's okay, let me take this.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.091
I'm just gonna put
it down over here.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:13.395
It's okay.

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:14.262
- Sorry.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.531
- It's okay.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:19.100
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:20.702
You're gonna be okay.

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:35.450
It's still hot.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:49.097
Do you, do you want
me to call anybody?

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.568
- I did.

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.839
- I mean anybody else?

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:00.809
- Like who?

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:06.648
Like the police?

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.284
- Whoever.

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.622
- There's no one to call.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:19.828
Except for my brother,

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.665
but that's why I
can't call the police.

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:30.638
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.207
- She gives him money.

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:40.148
He's a fuck-up, but he needs it.

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.151
She would cut him off
just to get to me,

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.752
and I can't do that to him,

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:49.457
and I can't fuck with
her just to get to him,

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.559
I have to help him instead.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.697
- That's really not
your responsibility.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:59.466
- And it's not yours, either.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:02.703
I'm sorry.

01:09:02.706 --> 01:09:05.206
- No, you're right, I get it.

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.542
It's complicated.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.846
- I'm sorry that I had
nowhere else to go to.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.683
- It's fine.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:19.888
- Why is it fine?

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.523
Why are you being so nice to me?

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.524
What, do you just feel so sorry

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:24.859
for the poor little black girl?

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.752
The tea smells good.

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:58.259
It's probably cool enough
to drink right now.

01:09:58.261 --> 01:10:00.295
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
no it's not, it's not.

01:10:00.297 --> 01:10:01.696
It's not cool enough.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:02.597
- I'll just leave it there.

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:03.565
- Yeah.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.799
We'll wait.

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:06.367
Yeah.

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.589
- This what I got
to look forward to?

01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:29.457
- Huh, unfortunately.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:32.594
Um, there is stuff to make
sandwiches in the fridge,

01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:35.630
and feel free to take
whatever you want, okay?

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:44.005
Also, if you have any
trouble like finding anything

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:47.575
or if you wanna talk,
just text me, okay?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.577
Actually, I'll just
call you later.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.279
- You don't have
to do that, okay.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:53.348
- I know, I know, I just
don't have any dinner food,

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.650
so we'll talk about
dinner, all right?

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:56.818
Okay, bye.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.007
This was a good call.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.309
- Yeah, I thought something
dimple would be good.

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.279
- Mm, how much do I
owe you for everything?

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:25.647
- No.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:28.716
- No, really, how
much do I owe you?

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:34.289
- Look, I really don't
have anywhere else to go.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.490
- I know.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:38.793
- And I really appreciate
you letting me stay with you.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.528
- Vee.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.664
- Just let me finish.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:44.065
- Okay.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:45.967
Sorry.

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.469
- I just don't wanna crowd you

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.737
and I don't wanna
overstay my welcome.

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:54.008
- Just let me pay for
food this time, bitch.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.980
- Okay.

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:00.815
Fine.

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:12.727
- You dip your
fries in barbecue?

01:12:12.729 --> 01:12:13.928
- You don't?

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:15.396
It's delicious.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:17.699
- Barbecue's for meat.

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:20.635
- You don't eat
barbecue potato chips?

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.884
- I'll just stick to ketchup.

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.489
Where are you goin'?

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.759
I hope you and your ketchup
are very happy together.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:47.695
- What's wrong with you?

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.697
- I'm just gettin' some water.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:50.732
Do you want some water?

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:52.367
- Sure.

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:57.805
I didn't know you were silly.

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.045
- I don't care,
Marge, I wanna see it.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:05.446
- Why?

01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:06.381
- Because it looks beautiful.

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.882
- It's out of your price range,

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.384
and it's a three-bedroom.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:11.652
- And there are
three of us here.

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:13.020
- Woah, I can't.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.022
I can't afford to
move yet, I mean,

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:16.491
I will but I can't do that.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.558
- I'm gonna go look at
it, and the two of you

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.895
can either come with me, or not.

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:25.700
Come on!

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:29.003
- Square, uh let me double
check on the details.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:30.805
I'm so excited to show
you this location.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:33.074
- Could be the start of a
really cool girl's club.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:36.110
I'm offering you a chance to
get in on the ground level.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.947
- I like my place, Cass.

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:45.586
- How much can you pay?

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.422
- Cass.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.424
- Are you comfortable
telling me?

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.659
I really like this place and
I can afford a big portion

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.928
of the rent.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.163
- Honestly?

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:57.698
- Of course.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.901
- I don't know, maybe 500 tops.

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:04.439
- She may not want
to live with you.

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.908
You may be putting
her on the spot.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.577
- I'm sorry, am I doing that?

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:12.713
- Not really.

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.917
I don't not wanna live with you.

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.452
- Mhm?

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.954
- But with both of you.

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:24.492
- Oh my god, you two.

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.031
You can't even move
for another month,

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:32.800
and this place'll
probably be gone by then.

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:33.901
- Three weeks.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:35.603
They'll save it for us.

01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:36.838
My credit score's bomb.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.673
And even if I do
have to pay extra,

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:41.242
it still represents
savings in the long run.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.011
If you join us.

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:46.214
- i don't wanna pay
an uneven share.

01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:48.549
- What if you get last
pick of the bedrooms?

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.083
- Cass.

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:50.518
- What?

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.221
She shouldn't have
to worry about that.

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:55.823
You need to start a new life.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.225
Of course you should
be comfortable

01:14:57.227 --> 01:14:59.627
with how that gets done, but

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.529
let people help you.

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.218
I'm not usually good
at helping people.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:09.070
Ultimately, money is
such a minor thing.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.239
- Says the person with money.

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:12.139
- Mhm.

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:14.141
- Rowr.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.079
- I...

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:23.584
I would consider
signing if Mags does.

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:26.053
- Ha!

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.223
Let's go this, Mags.

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.894
I am your destiny.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.664
We are your destiny.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:46.641
- I don't know if I
can break my lease.

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:47.575
- Ah!

01:15:47.577 --> 01:15:50.311
My dear, we will wait for you!

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.147
Hey lady!

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:54.849
Do you wanna keep
talking on the phone

01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:57.552
to a prospective client,
or do you wanna make money

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:59.053
right now?

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.622
I feel like this could
be really good for me.

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:04.025
For us.

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:06.294
I know I haven't been through
what Vee is going through,

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:10.798
or what Marge has been through,
and I'm thankful for that.

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.668
But maybe that means I can help.

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:16.604
Maybe when we live together,

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:20.007
if we talk with the
time, everybody's got

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:21.776
their own shit to deal with.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:25.079
I'm not exactly the
picture of happiness.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:28.683
A reset will be good.

01:16:28.685 --> 01:16:31.218
Why wouldn't I wanna
live with my best friend?

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.654
And the more I get to know
Vee, the more I like her.

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:36.223
She's really fucking smart,
and she's got a smart ass,

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.326
which is the best
kind of ass to have,

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:40.828
which makes her my
kind of roommate.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.099
I hope Girl's Club doesn't
turn into book club though.

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:46.901
It might with those two

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:48.135
I could do wine and books.

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:50.104
That could be my contribution.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:52.773
The wine.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.610
- I'm still afraid, yeah,

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:59.113
but I know it's gonna be

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.015
a long road, and
that it's gonna take

01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:02.984
more than change to help me,

01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:07.121
but I don't know,
maybe Cass was right.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.256
I just need something for me.

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:12.393
A new life for me.

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:15.162
Or at least something
with potential.

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.404
That's all I know for now,

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:26.407
just that it won't be the
same as it was before.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.877
- So.

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:32.346
Are we gonna talk
about the groceries,

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.048
or?

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.851
- Very funny, bitch.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.052
Very funny.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:40.054
- We'll see how it goes.

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.424
It might,

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:46.093
it will probably be good for me.

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.363
For all of us.

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.800
It's worth a shot.

01:17:54.737 --> 01:18:00.074
In addition to all the
searching and the talking.

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.749
Do you know why I
really said yes?

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:11.252
- Why?

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.455
- I'm not stupid.

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.323
I know Cass.

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:18.926
I knew something like
this might happen.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.098
The idea gave me hope.

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.867
You know?

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.904
Finally.

01:18:29.906 --> 01:18:31.372
Some real hope.

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:35.109
Something to be thankful for.

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:41.115
I mean, two people
who really get me,

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:45.486
two real people who will
always be there for me,

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.221
no matter what.

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.225
I feel that trust.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.034
How many times have
I walked in here

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:02.236
with that kind of positivity?
