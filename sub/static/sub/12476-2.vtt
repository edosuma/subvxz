we selected the farmer,

None of that matters.
Said there was a storm

It was a long time ago for me.

Did they induce a coma?

26:00.059 --> 26:02.826
And you don't have to.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.828
But a small town doctor,

26:04.830 --> 26:08.165
<i>the</i> small town doctor,

26:08.167 --> 26:10.634
people are gonna look
to him for answers.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.570
On a lot of things.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.972
It's just common sense.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.974
How do we stop it?

26:16.976 --> 26:21.678
We can't stop it, but he's not
a threat if you control it.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.180
I'll help you.

26:23.182 --> 26:27.117
Wayward Pines
has been here before.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.653
There can't be factions
or dissenting voices.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.689
There can only be
one person in charge.

26:32.691 --> 26:35.192
Otherwise, it all falls apart,
and we disappear. I know.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.196
(sighs)

26:44.169 --> 26:47.037
Just work with him, Jason.

26:47.039 --> 26:50.540
You don't want to start
this kind of fight.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.075
It isn't worth your time.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.114
You're right.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.116
He isn't worth it.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.884
Should never have
brought him out.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.955
Well, then I'd be dead.

27:08.694 --> 27:12.662
Our lives are worth
his arrogance.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.231
I'm still here today.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.366
You're still here.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.836
That's what
this town needs.

27:19.838 --> 27:22.439
He's difficult, yes.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.676
You and I both know
he's necessary

27:26.678 --> 27:28.478
to the survival of this town.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.220
I know.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.362
MAN:
You got it?

27:45.364 --> 27:47.230
Okay, let's go.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.783
(door closes)

28:06.785 --> 28:08.752
(lock clicks)

28:09.888 --> 28:11.354
Hi, Dr. Yedlin.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.257
Hello.

28:14.259 --> 28:17.094
Rebecca left
about an hour ago.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.030
Rebecca?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.032
She was your wife, right?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.034
Rebecca<i> is</i> my wife, yes.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.535
Who are you?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.237
Lucy Armstrong.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.805
She's my boss.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.777
Come on.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.419
(door closes)

28:42.421 --> 28:43.653
Hey.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.826
No longer an architect, huh?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.799
You're a beautician?

28:55.801 --> 28:57.234
Yeah.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.569
That's the job
I was assigned here.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.571
Just like you were
assigned yours.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.073
Hair?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.574
That's what I was
told to do, Theo.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.010
And sometimes,
in order to survive,

29:07.012 --> 29:08.979
you have to do
what they tell you to do.

29:08.981 --> 29:12.215
Your work meant
everything to you.

29:17.789 --> 29:19.623
I was on Main Street today,

29:19.625 --> 29:23.693
and I saw an ice cream parlor
called McConigle's.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.329
Wasn't that the name of your
favorite professor at Harvard?

29:26.331 --> 29:28.398
The School of Design?

29:31.703 --> 29:34.204
I wondered if you had
anything to do with that.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.607
(sighs)

29:37.609 --> 29:39.976
You're just being paranoid now.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.145
(laughs)

29:42.147 --> 29:44.648
Why wouldn't I be paranoid here?

29:44.650 --> 29:46.650
'Cause it won't get you far.

29:46.652 --> 29:49.653
Two years ago, the ice cream
parlor burned down.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.522
They asked for my help
to reconstruct it.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.524
And they let me pick the name.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.193
That's all there is to it.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.300
It's light activity tonight
and a full moon.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.202
The Mountain will be spotting
anything out there.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.470
We clear the fields,

30:07.472 --> 30:11.641
and we station the flamethrowers
here and here.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.343
What if the fire draws them in?

30:13.345 --> 30:15.145
We have never used
fire on them before.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.913
We don't know what
they understand about it.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.989
Well, tonight
they'll learn.

Okay.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.151
(camera beeping steadily)

33:09.354 --> 33:13.056
This is Ben Burke,
on the outside.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.493
This may be my last message.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.528
Sir.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.597
You better see this.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.342
Mom, I know you didn't

33:32.344 --> 33:35.011
always approve of me
taking things as far as I did,

33:35.013 --> 33:36.780
so I'm sorry.
He's alive.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.348
And...

33:38.350 --> 33:42.118
I know that Dad wasn't perfect,
but he taught me to fight

33:42.120 --> 33:43.920
for the things
that I believed in.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.589
You both did.

33:46.591 --> 33:50.026
And... I just wanted
to make you proud

33:50.028 --> 33:53.129
and do what was best
for everyone in Wayward Pines.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.933
I'm sorry that it wasn't enough.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.735
Jason, if you're watching this,

33:58.737 --> 34:02.038
you know that this is a mistake.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.773
You put me outside the fence,

34:03.775 --> 34:05.775
which is a death sentence,
and you know that.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.610
Pilcher said

34:07.612 --> 34:09.078
that one member of the First Generation...
Turn it off.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.814
...cannot harm another member.
Sir?

34:10.816 --> 34:12.382
Turn it off now.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.616
If any good comes of this,

34:13.618 --> 34:14.984
at least maybe
the people can see

34:14.986 --> 34:16.453
the kind of leader
that you really are.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.195
(indistinct chatter)

34:29.968 --> 34:31.968
Good job out there.
Thank you, sir.

34:31.970 --> 34:33.803
Good job out there.
Thank you, sir.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.805
Did you see Ben?

34:35.807 --> 34:38.441
(indistinct chatter)

34:38.443 --> 34:39.642
(laughs)

34:39.644 --> 34:41.711
Did you see Ben?

34:43.815 --> 34:45.114
Did you see him?

34:45.116 --> 34:47.116
Uh, no, I-I didn't.
I'm sorry.

34:47.118 --> 34:50.053
It is true what they say about
First Generation, isn't it?

34:51.990 --> 34:54.824
Isn't it the first rule

34:54.826 --> 34:56.926
that you can never
harm each other?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.161
Isn't that right?

34:59.931 --> 35:02.298
Mrs. Burke,
I understand that you're...

35:02.300 --> 35:05.668
He is out there,
and he may be alive.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.104
So why are you guys
sitting in here,

35:08.106 --> 35:09.472
not doing anything?

35:09.474 --> 35:11.374
I know
it's upsetting, ma'am,

35:11.376 --> 35:12.942
but we're just
following orders.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.545
How can you let Jason
do something like this?

35:17.482 --> 35:19.782
Please do something.

35:22.387 --> 35:23.720
Do something.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.292
Do something, please!

35:29.294 --> 35:30.860
Get her home.
Damn it!

35:45.677 --> 35:48.144
(engine starts)

35:48.146 --> 35:50.046
She's right.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.247
It's the first rule.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.482
He fought against us.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.017
But he's still one of us.

35:54.019 --> 35:55.218
We can ask Jason,
we could go...

35:55.220 --> 35:57.253
No.

35:57.255 --> 36:00.657
No, he'll just say no.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.824
Let's go.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.932
THEO:
Breathe in.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.568
(inhales)

36:11.570 --> 36:12.702
Breathe out.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.537
(exhales)

36:14.539 --> 36:16.573
I'm fine.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.374
I need to get
back to work.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.509
Give us the room.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.983
Uh, get out.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.589
You don't feel any pain?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.924
I know what pain is. I'm fine.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.760
And thank you for what
you did when I was hurt.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.228
That's my job.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.030
Right?

36:41.032 --> 36:43.433
Unless, of course,
you need a barber somewhere.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.801
(chuckles)

36:46.538 --> 36:48.638
He listens to you, doesn't he?

36:48.640 --> 36:51.541
He does what
Pilcher would've wanted.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.376
And he does what's right.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.078
But you have his ear.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.413
I should hope so, Dr. Yedlin.

36:57.415 --> 36:58.615
Do you have a point?

36:58.617 --> 37:00.917
No point.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.553
Just trying to figure out
how it all works here.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.989
Make this hospital work.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.057
You can leave the rest to us.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.084
You should eat, Kerry.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.486
I'm trying.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.553
(chuckles softly)

37:41.092 --> 37:43.993
Tonight, the people
of Wayward Pines

37:43.995 --> 37:46.663
are gonna eat real food.

37:46.665 --> 37:50.266
The fence will hold,
the rebels are crushed.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.335
The town is starting to finally
come back together.

37:52.337 --> 37:53.770
(chuckles)

37:57.642 --> 37:58.775
Theresa's running around,

37:58.777 --> 38:01.711
asking about Ben.

38:01.713 --> 38:02.845
I know.

38:02.847 --> 38:05.782
The rules, Jason.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.051
No First Gen can harm
another First Gen.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.318
We were taught that.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.354
I didn't harm him.

38:11.356 --> 38:14.057
I exiled him.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.692
The Abbies did the harm.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.130
He tried to turn us
against each other.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.401
You might have to explain that
to some people.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.204
I shouldn't have to.

38:30.041 --> 38:33.576
He wasn't really
First Gen, anyway.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.812
He came in late.
He's not an original.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.880
I'm not an original, either.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.219
That's different.

38:43.221 --> 38:44.587
You are different.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.163
You're loyal.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.911
You're mine.

39:14.619 --> 39:15.852
(crops rustle)

39:15.854 --> 39:17.320
(gasps)

39:35.206 --> 39:37.273
Mario, is that you?

39:42.113 --> 39:43.312
Where's Ben?

39:47.118 --> 39:49.185
Xander, it's me.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.964
Where is Ben?!

40:05.570 --> 40:07.970
Damn it, I am his mother!
Where is he?!

40:08.940 --> 40:10.706
(growling)

40:12.677 --> 40:14.477
I'm sorry, Dad.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.546
(screeching)

40:20.819 --> 40:22.084
(door closes)

40:23.688 --> 40:25.388
(softly):
Hey.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.774
Infectious disease.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.611
Didn't get it.
Didn't care.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.082
I don't think I ever
delivered a baby.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.286
Not on my own, anyway.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.956
Can't remember the last time
I set a broken bone.

41:02.827 --> 41:06.629
In your residency,
you did a bit of everything.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.731
You'll get it back.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.039
My index finger.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.475
Up in the Sierras.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.313
White Bear Hot Spring.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.850
That was Eden.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.319
Well, we were naked.

41:32.357 --> 41:34.423
And the bungalow?

41:36.261 --> 41:38.995
Is that where you still are?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.396
Your head?

41:40.398 --> 41:41.898
When I woke up here,

41:41.900 --> 41:43.966
I thought you were dead.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.404
And now you're here.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.273
Sitting with me. You're alive.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.947
I am happy about it.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.315
(sighs)

42:03.187 --> 42:07.423
But that's-that's
as far as I can go.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.325
For now.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.599
♪ ♪

42:36.821 --> 42:38.521
Look.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.899
At what?

42:51.836 --> 42:53.069
Nothing.

42:54.672 --> 42:57.239
I've checked
all the cameras--

42:57.241 --> 42:59.108
not an Abby
in any of them.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.910
This has never
happened before.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.445
Is it possible?

43:02.447 --> 43:05.348
They're gone.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.850
(snarling)

43:50.061 --> 43:52.094
