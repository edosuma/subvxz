WEBVTT

00:02.593 --> 00:04.761
(quietly): Hey, what took you so long?
Come on in.

00:04.762 --> 00:07.246
Hey. No, no. Why are we having
a secret meeting in an empty loft?

00:07.247 --> 00:09.265
Because I don't want Schmidt
to find us.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.167
- (shudders) It's creepy, right?
- I know, right?

00:11.168 --> 00:13.715
- Yeah, it is.
- This place gives me the willies, man.

00:13.716 --> 00:15.898
Do you know why they can't keep
a tenant in here?

00:15.919 --> 00:18.420
- Why?
- Because Mrs. Beverly died on the toilet.

00:18.421 --> 00:20.223
And to come here
on Halloween...?

00:20.256 --> 00:22.471
- Seems risky.
- What's risky?

00:22.472 --> 00:23.713
The ghost situation.

00:23.726 --> 00:26.037
I brought you guys in here
to talk about Schmidt.

00:26.038 --> 00:27.762
I'm really worried about him.

00:27.763 --> 00:29.498
He hasn't been to work
for three days.

00:29.532 --> 00:31.500
He just sits on the couch
eating cold cuts

00:31.534 --> 00:33.859
and yelling at the news
about how nothing matters.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.076
- It's a problem.
- Right.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.465
Be honest,
it's a real problem.

00:36.466 --> 00:38.114
He's just going through
a whole thing, you know?

00:38.115 --> 00:40.249
The Cece-Elizabeth breakup
has gotten to him.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.552
Right now
he is completely unhinged.

00:43.032 --> 00:45.237
- Y'all feel that?
- What is going on?

00:45.263 --> 00:47.453
Not saying there's a ghost, but I felt
a weird breeze go through my body,

00:47.454 --> 00:49.322
- that's all I'm saying.
- JESS: There's no ghost.

00:49.323 --> 00:51.490
Guys, I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

00:51.530 --> 00:53.431
I miss the old Schmidt.

00:53.432 --> 00:55.484
I want him to be happy again.

00:55.485 --> 00:58.057
He's crumbling
before our very eyes.

00:58.061 --> 01:00.137
And I'm having a party tonight,

01:00.138 --> 01:02.206
and I just can't have him
lying on the couch,

01:02.207 --> 01:04.509
wiping his tears with deli meat.

01:04.510 --> 01:07.250
- I'll talk to him, okay?
- Thank you.

01:07.251 --> 01:10.919
People get weird with breakups.
Trust me, I got this.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.269
- (gruff voice): You got this.
- JESS: That was Winston.

01:13.270 --> 01:15.171
- Was that you or was that in here, dude?
- That was...

01:15.172 --> 01:16.632
Don't do that!

01:16.633 --> 01:17.833
(chuckles)

01:18.546 --> 01:21.414
Oh, come on, Obama.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.783
Tanks pull in, tanks pull out.

01:23.818 --> 01:27.354
Babies are born,
old people die.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.690
And yet the world keeps spinning
and spinning and spinning,

01:30.725 --> 01:32.425
and one day, it stops.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.094
And then what?

01:34.128 --> 01:37.230
You want... you want to talk
about... health care?

01:39.881 --> 01:41.114
That's mayo, buddy.

01:41.115 --> 01:43.737
(Nick, Jess and Winston groan)

01:43.771 --> 01:45.739
(whispers):
Yeah, I don't got this.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.141
(grunts)

01:48.176 --> 01:50.377
? Who's that girl?

01:50.411 --> 01:52.779
? <i>Who's that girl?</i> ?
? It's Jess.

01:52.804 --> 01:55.589

Sync & corrections: Reef

01:58.753 --> 02:00.921
- ? Pumpkining...
- You're really good at that.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.590
Thanks, man. Yeah. What
are you carving there?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.625
- It's a pumpkin.
- Oh, look at that. That's beautiful.

02:05.660 --> 02:08.094
- My pumpkin!
- Pumpkin doesn't matter.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.131
Hey. I just wanted
to talk to you, um...

02:11.165 --> 02:14.968
- About my party tonight.
- You don't want me to come to the party?

02:15.002 --> 02:17.354
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:17.355 --> 02:19.412
Jess, do you not want me
to come to your party?

02:19.424 --> 02:21.142
- No. I... No.
- Doesn't matter.

02:21.168 --> 02:24.511
I wouldn't go if I weren't
throwing it, you know?

02:24.512 --> 02:26.580
It's, like, more
of a business-networking...

02:26.581 --> 02:28.882
It's not a big deal at all.
I just won't come.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.429
I'll stay at home, and...
I'll just hang out in my costume.

02:31.430 --> 02:33.476
Oh, wait a minute.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.855
Your home is my home.

02:40.330 --> 02:41.928
See you at the party.
(door shuts)

02:41.963 --> 02:44.497
- What the hell?
- He's a total maniac.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.500
Well, you know what, Jess?
He doesn't get like this often.

02:47.535 --> 02:51.671
But when he does,
oh, there is an option.

02:51.706 --> 02:54.207
WINSTON: Nick, I think
it's time for Schmidt

02:54.242 --> 02:56.451
- to get a letter from an old friend.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:56.452 --> 02:58.134
- What old friend?
- Forget you heard anything.

02:58.135 --> 02:59.418
- What old friend?
- Nothing, J...

02:59.419 --> 03:00.783
- We need him, Nick.
- No, we don't.

03:00.808 --> 03:02.132
- We got to bring him back.
- Bring who back?

03:02.158 --> 03:04.611
- Winston, don't do this!
- Guys, does nobody listen to me?!

03:04.612 --> 03:05.931
- ...without him!
- Who is he?

03:06.187 --> 03:08.688
- Michael Keaton.
- You stupid...

03:08.689 --> 03:11.791
Michael Keaton, the actor?
The Batman?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.690
Nick, are you gonna tell her,
or should I?

03:13.691 --> 03:16.365
- I'm not telling her.
- Fine. I'll do it.

03:16.366 --> 03:18.934
- You will?
- When Schmidt was seven years old...

03:18.961 --> 03:22.443
(groans) You're a terrible storyteller.
I'll just do it myself, I guess.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.140
When Schmidt
was seven years old,

03:27.174 --> 03:29.142
his daddy divorced
his mommy...

03:29.176 --> 03:32.812
<i>And Schmidt was left
without the love of a father.</i>

03:32.847 --> 03:35.015
(crying)
<i>He didn't take it well.</i>

03:35.049 --> 03:37.910
<i>He began an endless cycle</i>
<i>of crying and chocolate.</i>

03:37.911 --> 03:42.255
<i>Mrs. Schmidt tried everything
to cheer him up, but nothing worked.</i>

03:42.290 --> 03:46.226
<i>Desperate, she looked to the stars.
Movie stars.</i>

03:46.260 --> 03:50.764
<i>Mrs. Schmidt wrote that little fat loser
a letter of support from the star</i>

03:50.798 --> 03:52.900
<i>of his favorite movie,
Batman.</i>

03:52.901 --> 03:56.536
<i>But not the confusing new one.
The good one, with Michael Keaton.</i>

03:57.972 --> 04:02.075
<i>And when Schmidt got his disgusting
chubby hands on Keaton's letter,</i>

04:02.076 --> 04:03.764
<i>his life changed forever.</i>

04:03.765 --> 04:04.970
Yes!

04:04.971 --> 04:06.905
<i>But the real trouble</i>
<i>was just beginning.</i>

04:06.906 --> 04:10.308
<i>You see, Schmidt wrote back.
And he kept writing back</i>

04:10.309 --> 04:14.196
<i>about any problem he faced:
bullies, schoolwork,</i>

04:14.197 --> 04:15.989
<i>public erections.</i>

04:16.023 --> 04:19.502
<i>And for every letter he sent,</i>
<i>Michael Keaton sent one back.</i>

04:19.517 --> 04:21.632
JESS:
<i>Was Winston's version shorter?</i>

04:21.632 --> 04:24.379
<i>NICK: Then one day, that tubby
goon went off to college.</i>

04:24.380 --> 04:25.598
Whoa.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.837
<i>So Mrs. Schmidt unloaded
the secret on her son's only friend,</i>

04:28.860 --> 04:31.271
<i>a man named me.
It was me.</i>

04:31.305 --> 04:33.106
<i>- JESS: Yeah, I got that.
- NICK: Really? People don't...</i>

04:33.140 --> 04:35.075
JESS:
<i>No, I got it.</i>

04:35.109 --> 04:38.395
<i>NICK: College proved tough for Schmidt,
and old patterns soon returned.</i>

04:38.396 --> 04:39.813
(crying)

04:39.847 --> 04:43.683
<i>It became impossible to study,</i>
<i>and I knew what I had to do.</i>

04:43.718 --> 04:44.984
<i>And again...</i>

04:45.019 --> 04:46.786
<i>- New message.
- ...It worked.</i>

04:46.821 --> 04:50.612
<i>With Keaton in his corner, he pulled
himself away from that bag of turkey</i>

04:50.613 --> 04:52.392
<i>- ...and became a man.</i>
- One...

04:52.426 --> 04:55.829
<i>He lost five pounds,
gained confidence with women...</i>

04:57.431 --> 04:59.999
<i>...and he saw the hit movie
Multiplicity...</i>

05:00.034 --> 05:02.321
- 25 times.
- Oh, my God.

05:02.322 --> 05:04.223
You've been cat fishing Schmidt.

05:04.224 --> 05:06.306
Do you think we could use
this whole Michael Keaton thing

05:06.307 --> 05:08.141
- ...to turn Schmidt around?
- Absolutely.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.852
- Great!
- But I won't do it.

05:09.878 --> 05:12.145
- Why not?
- Because I put it to bed, okay?

05:12.179 --> 05:14.848
It's over. He'll do
anything Keaton says.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.480
The letters are
too powerful.

05:16.481 --> 05:18.481
I'm lying to my best friend.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.675
And I also feel like I'm betraying
the real Keaton, who I really love.

05:21.676 --> 05:24.112
Well, then why did you tell me
that whole story, Nick?

05:24.113 --> 05:26.591
Because it's a great story,
and I'm a teller of stories.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.762
But I won't do it. Sorry.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.597
You think you tell that story
better than me?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.432
Look, you leave out
way too many details, man.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.530
You don't just say
he was chewing a candy bar.

05:34.531 --> 05:37.289
You say he was chewing
on a <i>nougat-y</i> candy bar.

05:37.290 --> 05:40.523
NICK: That's not the kind of writer I am.
I don't say words like "nougat-y."

05:40.524 --> 05:42.847
I'm simple.
I'm like Hemingway.

05:53.915 --> 05:57.217
- Hey, Cece.
- Oh, hey.

05:57.218 --> 05:59.352
I came to find out if you're
coming to my party today.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.754
You never answered my e-mail.

06:00.788 --> 06:03.190
Yeah, I meant to, uh...
to tell you I can't make it.

06:03.224 --> 06:04.858
Sorry. Um...

06:04.893 --> 06:08.428
I've been going out drinking a lot lately.
It's kind of wiping me out.

06:10.802 --> 06:12.633
Please come to my party, Cece.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.468
It's Schmidt, you know?

06:14.502 --> 06:16.703
- I don't think I'm ready for that, so...
- Yeah.

06:16.738 --> 06:20.121
What if I could promise you
Schmidt wouldn't be there?

06:26.629 --> 06:27.881
Who wants candy?

06:27.916 --> 06:29.583
- Did you go trick-or-treating?
- No.

06:29.617 --> 06:33.676
I was out, I had my errand tote, and
a couple of neighbors gave me candy.

06:33.677 --> 06:34.941
Is that trick-or-treating?

06:34.942 --> 06:36.790
Yes, that's the definition
of trick-or-treating, Jess.

06:36.824 --> 06:39.626
Hello! Uh, Jess, I'd like you to
know that I've changed my mind,

06:39.661 --> 06:41.728
and I won't be coming
to your party tonight.

06:41.763 --> 06:45.854
I've been e-mailing with an old friend
of mine, and he made me realize

06:45.855 --> 06:48.135
- ...that I should give Cece her space.
- An old friend, huh?

06:48.136 --> 06:50.871
Well, Nick knows. You know,
I don't like to throw his name around

06:50.872 --> 06:53.264
because I don't like people
treating me any differently, but...

06:53.290 --> 06:54.620
It's Michael Keaton.

06:54.621 --> 06:56.843
What?! (laughs)

06:56.878 --> 06:59.513
Uh, okay. Calm down.

06:59.547 --> 07:02.525
The actor?!
(chuckling)

07:02.572 --> 07:04.418
Seriously, you guys.
Don't treat me any different.

07:04.452 --> 07:06.071
He's kind of my friend.
Michael Keaton.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.288
There was one time he e-mailed me.
He said he was my best friend.

07:08.323 --> 07:10.590
Anyway, we have so much
catching up to do,

07:10.625 --> 07:12.596
me and Michael,
so just enjoy the night.

07:12.597 --> 07:14.932
That's crazy, Schmidt.
Ah, man.

07:15.863 --> 07:18.632
- (quietly): What did you do?
- Jessica Damn Day.

07:18.666 --> 07:20.634
I just got Schmidt
to not come to the party.

07:20.668 --> 07:23.036
Keaton hasn't written Schmidt
in three years.

07:23.071 --> 07:25.895
We have no idea
how Schmidt is gonna react.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.341
If Schmidt finds out
Keaton isn't real,

07:27.375 --> 07:29.643
it'll destroy the entire life
he has built around him.

07:29.677 --> 07:31.878
We are talking
about a <i>Truman Show</i> situation.

07:31.913 --> 07:34.641
Oh, yeah, I love that movie.
What part are you talking about?

07:34.649 --> 07:36.783
Well, I'm talking
about the part in the movie

07:36.818 --> 07:39.519
when Truman realizes
that his whole life is a lie,

07:39.554 --> 07:41.121
and then he goes crazy.

07:41.155 --> 07:43.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there
in the middle of the movie.

07:43.825 --> 07:45.625
No, it's the whole movie.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.294
Oh, yeah, I know, I was just...
'cause there's the one...

07:47.295 --> 07:48.732
- There's like a scene.
- You haven't seen it.

07:48.747 --> 07:52.366
He didn't see the movie.
Okay, guys, he almost found out once.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.234
Now, luckily, I handled it.

07:54.268 --> 07:55.969
I don't understand.

07:56.004 --> 08:00.240
In 1995, he told me specifically
that he had never been to Nicaragua.

08:00.241 --> 08:02.471
It doesn't make any sense.
Aah!

08:02.472 --> 08:04.451
You have no idea
what you've done.

08:04.452 --> 08:08.650
Hey, uh, you guys, do you think that
it's too early to e-mail Michael back?

08:08.651 --> 08:09.987
Should I send
him an e-card?

08:09.988 --> 08:12.319
Does that change anything,
or does that change everything?

08:12.353 --> 08:13.661
- I think you're overthinking it.
- You know what?

08:13.662 --> 08:14.988
- You're right. You're right.
- Be cool.

08:15.023 --> 08:17.391
I think I'm way too up here,
all upstairs.

08:17.425 --> 08:19.379
Got to bring it
down... here to here.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.428
Not any lower, though.
It's not like that.

08:21.462 --> 08:23.997
- I know it's not.
- Bro, it's not like that.

08:24.032 --> 08:25.599
- No one thinks it is, bro.
- Cool.

08:25.633 --> 08:27.367
(chuckling):
All right.

08:27.402 --> 08:28.835
He's already getting weird.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.436
- Here.
- No, Je...

08:31.425 --> 08:33.707
You... come to the master.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.674
(typing)
What are you writing?

08:35.710 --> 08:37.544
(laptop plays whooshing tone)

08:37.578 --> 08:40.514
I fixed it again.
You're welcome again.

08:40.548 --> 08:42.515
So you just wrote from Keaton,

08:42.549 --> 08:44.551
"I'm going on vacation"?

08:44.585 --> 08:47.054
(electronic chiming)
He would never write that, Jess.

08:47.088 --> 08:48.789
- Why not?
- SCHMIDT: Vacation?!

08:48.823 --> 08:51.672
Oh, Michael, you...
stop going away.

08:52.427 --> 08:54.262
NICK: I knew this
would happen.

08:55.997 --> 08:58.432
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Schmidty.

08:58.466 --> 09:00.300
He left me again.

09:00.334 --> 09:02.602
It makes sense.

09:02.637 --> 09:05.705
Why would a guy like Michael Keaton
be friends with me anyway?

09:05.740 --> 09:08.075
I'm sure he likes you
a lot, Schmidt.

09:08.109 --> 09:09.449
Why would he?

09:09.450 --> 09:13.947
I guess I'll just always be the fat boy
who eats fat-boy cheese.

09:19.654 --> 09:21.655
(Schmidt whimpering)

09:23.191 --> 09:25.110
I didn't want
to have to do this.

09:26.994 --> 09:29.517
JESS: Oh, is that
really necessary, Nick?

09:29.518 --> 09:31.011
- Shh.
- What?

09:31.012 --> 09:33.633
Let him work. I'm kind
of like his Robin.

09:33.668 --> 09:35.769
- You're not like my Robin.
- You want to be Robin?

09:35.770 --> 09:37.569
He doesn't have
all the responsibilities of Batman,

09:37.570 --> 09:38.939
but he can take
some of the glory.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.546
- Robin's a joke.
- Robin's the joke.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.849
I think we can all agree.

09:41.850 --> 09:43.910
The kids look up to him,
you know, in the community.

09:43.945 --> 09:46.291
I haven't been inside
Keaton's mind in a long time,

09:46.292 --> 09:48.515
and I need
my proper inspiration.

09:48.549 --> 09:49.935
Thank you.

09:50.618 --> 09:52.119
Why do you have
a picture of a bear?

09:52.153 --> 09:55.781
The great Michael Keaton
attacks each new role

09:55.782 --> 09:58.792
with the ferocity of
a hungry brown bear.

09:58.826 --> 10:03.557
It is his entire acting philosophy,
which I totally made up.

10:03.558 --> 10:05.162
I sleep with this person.

10:05.163 --> 10:06.797
Speak to me, Keaton.

10:08.503 --> 10:09.803
Mmm.

10:10.201 --> 10:11.802
Here we go.

10:11.803 --> 10:13.940
(typing)

10:13.975 --> 10:16.109
(whoosh)

10:16.144 --> 10:18.178
Oh, hey, Nick,
that's incredible.

10:18.212 --> 10:22.115
"Courage is not the absence of fear,
but the triumph over it"?

10:22.150 --> 10:24.518
Yes, I stole that
from Nelson Mandela.

10:24.552 --> 10:26.786
I added the part about
the Penguin and the Riddler.

10:26.821 --> 10:28.822
(phone chimes)

10:29.773 --> 10:31.063
Oh. All right.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.226
(whooshing tone)
(laptop chimes)

10:33.261 --> 10:34.948
Is that him?
Did it work?

10:35.663 --> 10:37.831
He wrote back smiley face.

10:37.865 --> 10:41.134
- He wrote back smiley face.
- He wrote back smiley face.

10:41.169 --> 10:43.170
(knocking)

10:44.739 --> 10:48.074
- ALL: Trick or treat!
- Oh, how adorable.

10:48.109 --> 10:51.044
You know, I just got a treat, too.
It's not candy; I'm not a...

10:51.078 --> 10:53.146
Not a dumb little baby
like all of you.

10:53.181 --> 10:56.309
"Happy Hallow's Eve."
(chuckles)

10:56.310 --> 10:58.051
And send.
(whooshes)

10:58.085 --> 10:59.519
(electronic chime in distance)

10:59.554 --> 11:03.190
- Just give us our candy.
- Hush, little boy.

11:04.592 --> 11:05.625
(whooshes)

11:05.660 --> 11:07.294
(electronic chime)

11:07.328 --> 11:09.496
(whooshes)

11:09.530 --> 11:11.898
(electronic chime)
He wrote back.

11:11.933 --> 11:13.667
- "Hi."
- Okay, I got this.

11:13.701 --> 11:15.936
"Speak to me, old chum.

11:15.970 --> 11:18.738
"I canceled my trip to provide
earthquake relief.

11:18.773 --> 11:20.625
This seemed more important."
Boom.

11:20.626 --> 11:22.008
- JESS: That's so good.
- NICK: Yeah, it's pretty good.

11:22.043 --> 11:23.577
JESS: You really have
the Keaton voice down.

11:23.611 --> 11:25.679
NICK: "You're a
friend for life."

11:25.713 --> 11:27.546
- JESS: That's good.
- NICK: "M.K."

11:27.547 --> 11:30.389
- I think that's good.
- I think that's really good, actually.

11:33.287 --> 11:35.517
Hi. Welcome. Happy Halloween.

11:35.518 --> 11:37.319
Drinks are over there.

11:37.353 --> 11:39.454
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:40.356 --> 11:43.759
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm Joey Ramona Quimby.

11:43.793 --> 11:45.240
I don't get it.

11:45.241 --> 11:49.204
Joey Ramone... a Quimby.

11:49.205 --> 11:51.139
(laughs)

11:51.140 --> 11:54.558
What are you? You look like
you're just wearing trash from your car.

11:54.559 --> 11:58.161
No, I'm not. I'm the Paper
Mountain Trash King...

11:58.165 --> 11:59.904
I just got trash
from my car.

11:59.905 --> 12:03.493
And now the man who once played center
for the New York Knicks in the nude,

12:03.494 --> 12:05.681
David Letterman!

12:05.682 --> 12:08.197
- That is a terrible Letterman.
- Really?

12:08.198 --> 12:10.016
People at work tell me
I look just like Dave.

12:10.051 --> 12:12.087
You look
just like Letterman.

12:12.088 --> 12:14.203
You know, I have
always thought that.

12:14.689 --> 12:18.124
What, uh, what... uh, Nick, Nick Miller.
So you a, uh...?

12:18.860 --> 12:20.159
You're a...

12:20.160 --> 12:22.162
(giggling)

12:22.196 --> 12:23.663
- What is that?
- That's, that's his laugh.

12:23.698 --> 12:26.030
- He's never done that.
- That's his laugh. (both laugh)

12:26.031 --> 12:28.132
SCHMIDT:
Do you like my costume?

12:29.604 --> 12:32.172
I'm a public serpent.

12:32.206 --> 12:33.874
Um, I thought
you weren't coming.

12:33.908 --> 12:35.529
Oh, I changed my mind.

12:35.678 --> 12:38.278
You know, I reread a few
of Keaton's e-mails.

12:38.312 --> 12:39.958
He can be quite cryptic.

12:39.966 --> 12:41.581
I think what he meant
when he said

12:41.616 --> 12:45.488
that life was meaningful was really,
"Go to the party."

12:45.489 --> 12:48.618
- I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that.
- I know Keaton best.

12:48.619 --> 12:51.358
Hey, Winston, by the way,
great costume.

12:51.392 --> 12:52.945
Maya Angelou.

12:53.895 --> 12:56.530
Crap. What am I gonna do?
Cece's on her way.

12:56.564 --> 12:59.043
Schmidt is
rereading e-mails.

12:59.044 --> 13:02.936
Do you know what happens after rereading?
Figuring it out. It's <i>The Truman Show.</i>

13:02.970 --> 13:04.604
<i>Truman Show,</i> man,
I love that movie.

13:04.639 --> 13:06.473
I'm not convinced
you've ever seen it.

13:06.474 --> 13:08.241
I have; it's about
the Civil War.

13:08.276 --> 13:11.174
- Batcave?
- Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go.

13:13.414 --> 13:16.183
- Winston, go to Cece's and stall.
- Okay, fine.

13:16.184 --> 13:19.156
But I got to hit the little King of the
Late Night Talk Show's room first.

13:19.163 --> 13:21.555
Maybe slow down on that.
You're not great with booze.

13:21.589 --> 13:23.223
- Hey, I got it, I got it.
- You got it? Good.

13:23.257 --> 13:26.209
Um, "You're in grave danger.
Leave where you are immediately."

13:26.210 --> 13:27.481
- Send. Okay.
- Don't! (whooshes)

13:27.482 --> 13:28.603
- You just sent that?
- Yeah.

13:28.604 --> 13:31.045
A team has to talk about a decision
before you hit send.

13:31.046 --> 13:32.632
JESS: Sorry. I thought it
was a really good move.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.734
- Trick or treat.
- Shh.

13:34.769 --> 13:36.970
NICK: All right,
you got to fix this.

13:37.004 --> 13:39.808
I'll meet you at your
building in 30 minutes.

13:39.809 --> 13:41.209
Terrible!
Send.

13:41.210 --> 13:42.778
- No!
- What?

13:42.812 --> 13:44.231
Now what are we gonna do?

13:44.232 --> 13:46.017
- You told him Keaton was coming here?
- No, Nick.

13:46.018 --> 13:48.517
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's a stall! It's a stall...

13:48.551 --> 13:51.219
Until we can come up with a better plan.
(knocking)

13:51.254 --> 13:53.455
- Well, who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

13:53.489 --> 13:55.657
KIDS:
Trick or treat!

13:56.730 --> 13:58.284
You.

14:00.496 --> 14:03.598
I don't get what you're doing!
Are you drunk?

14:04.535 --> 14:06.202
A little.

14:06.203 --> 14:09.045
- What's your endgame here?
- It's Halloween night.

14:09.046 --> 14:12.434
This is the night when anyone
can dress up in a costume

14:12.435 --> 14:14.432
and be anybody
that... they want.

14:14.433 --> 14:17.498
Would you listen to your
woman voice for one second?

14:17.499 --> 14:20.515
Oh, you think I'm gonna talk to him in
a woman voice when I'm talking to him?

14:20.550 --> 14:22.351
No, I have a character.

14:22.385 --> 14:24.704
You're doing a character?
Well, I'd love to hear it.

14:25.788 --> 14:27.489
I'm the Batman.

14:27.523 --> 14:29.658
- (laughing): Oh.
- Right...?

14:29.692 --> 14:32.294
So good. What, am I in the
movie theater, eating popcorn?

14:34.232 --> 14:36.268
Jess, you're
also five, four.

14:36.269 --> 14:39.071
Keep going further away. The further
you're away, the bigger you look.

14:39.072 --> 14:40.948
- I would say run a little bit.
- SCHMIDT: Nick!

14:40.949 --> 14:42.984
Jess, go!
Go...

14:42.985 --> 14:44.680
- Hey. Uh, Nick.
- Hey.

14:44.681 --> 14:47.649
By chance, have you seen
anyone famous in the vicinity?

14:47.650 --> 14:50.652
This vicinity?
Famous? Like, um...

14:50.682 --> 14:53.630
- Look that way.
- What?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.740
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's unbelievable.

15:02.012 --> 15:03.713
- Well, it's my hero.
- Yeah.

15:03.747 --> 15:07.216
- SCHMIDT: That is Michael Keaton.
- Right there.

15:07.251 --> 15:11.550
SCHMIDT: Why is he wearing his costume
from the movie he did 24 years ago?

15:11.551 --> 15:14.357
NICK: If he wore the outfit from <i>Clean
and Sober,</i> you wouldn't recognize him.

15:14.391 --> 15:17.551
- I'm the Batman.
- It's Halloween. Don't overthink it.

15:17.552 --> 15:19.387
Well, you saw him. There he is.
Let's get out of here.

15:19.421 --> 15:20.788
I have to meet him, Nick.
I have to.

15:20.822 --> 15:21.895
No, you don't have to
meet him. No, no, no...

15:21.896 --> 15:24.167
You're a great kid, Sch...
You're a great kid, Schmidt.

15:24.168 --> 15:26.436
No. Let me take you out to eat.
I want to buy you something

15:26.437 --> 15:28.405
- 'cause you met your hero.
- Go to an all-night diner.

15:28.406 --> 15:30.474
- No, I have to meet... Got to meet him.
- He's got to...

15:30.475 --> 15:32.408
- It's Michael Keaton!
- Go get a blintz or two!

15:32.409 --> 15:33.509
Aah!

15:33.544 --> 15:37.180
- Michael! It's me Schmidt.
- See you later, Michael! Take off!

15:37.214 --> 15:38.581
We have so much
to talk about.

15:38.615 --> 15:40.666
Our heroes are never
who we want them to be!

15:40.667 --> 15:41.967
Oh.

15:43.536 --> 15:45.745
Oh. You met him.

15:45.746 --> 15:47.190
It's Keaton.

15:47.191 --> 15:49.130
Come on, you
guys. I know.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.306
I've known the whole time.
What, do you think I'm stupid?

15:52.477 --> 15:54.044
No. It just... I...

15:54.078 --> 15:56.180
Just don't really know
what to say in this situation.

15:56.182 --> 15:58.004
Look, please don't blame Nick.
It's not his fault.

15:58.005 --> 16:00.363
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

16:00.364 --> 16:03.114
How dare you hack into
the private e-mail account

16:03.115 --> 16:05.951
of one of our nation's
finest actors!

16:07.594 --> 16:09.795
I'm gonna have to tell
Michael about this.

16:09.796 --> 16:11.970
No! No!

16:11.971 --> 16:15.049
- No, don't tell Michael!
- Jess, please stop.

16:15.949 --> 16:18.731
Thank you for what you're trying
to do, but it's over.

16:18.846 --> 16:20.739
It has to be over.

16:21.712 --> 16:25.448
Schmidt, I'm Michael Keaton.

16:26.640 --> 16:31.411
I'm the owner of the e-mail
address KeatonPotatoes@aol.com.

16:31.445 --> 16:34.180
What?

16:34.215 --> 16:37.577
It was me...
The whole time.

16:37.603 --> 16:38.988
No...

16:39.004 --> 16:40.653
- No, you can't...
- How do you think

16:40.688 --> 16:43.587
I know that you kissed
the bus driver at spring break?

16:43.588 --> 16:48.000
Or that you want to open up
a glassware boutique in Connecticut?

16:48.234 --> 16:51.013
- Or about the wall hole?
- This is impossible! I've been...

16:51.014 --> 16:53.031
I've been writing with Michael
Keaton since I was a kid!

16:53.032 --> 16:55.725
Your mother came up
with the idea, Schmidt.

16:55.897 --> 16:59.632
- But since college, it's been me.
- My mom?

16:59.678 --> 17:03.104
You're gonna tell me that my mom
helped me with my public erections?

17:03.105 --> 17:04.627
I drew pictures!

17:04.628 --> 17:07.285
He didn't want you
to find out this way.

17:09.324 --> 17:11.358
WINSTON:
Hey.

17:14.832 --> 17:16.726
- I got to go.
- Wait. Schmidt!

17:16.727 --> 17:20.160
- Oh! Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Uh...
- A bully! Get him!

17:20.194 --> 17:22.028
Oh! Oh!

17:22.061 --> 17:23.685
- Come on.
- Hey, kids, get out of here! (groaning)

17:23.686 --> 17:26.789
Scat! Scat!
(hissing) Back off!

17:30.793 --> 17:34.971
Cece, wait. I swear, I did not know
he was gonna be here. I'm so sorry.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.507
No, Jess. It's-it's fine.
Okay, it's fine.

17:37.508 --> 17:41.444
In fact... it's actually
kind of perfect.

17:41.445 --> 17:45.673
I think, since this whole thing went
down, I've just been running away.

17:45.674 --> 17:49.844
You know, I mean,
actually seeing Schmidt, I...

17:50.279 --> 17:53.318
I finally feel like
I have some closure.

17:53.319 --> 17:55.384
Well, good. I'm glad.

17:55.385 --> 17:57.319
You deserve some.

17:59.251 --> 18:01.837
So let's fire up
the Batman Mobile,

18:01.838 --> 18:04.793
go to a taco stand and eat
some feelings, okay?

18:04.816 --> 18:06.991
Okay, I just...
I think it's Batmobile.

18:07.026 --> 18:08.226
Batman Mobile.

18:08.251 --> 18:11.004
No. Batmobile.

18:11.036 --> 18:12.864
That's what I said...
Batman Mobile.

18:12.898 --> 18:14.699
You're putting the man...
There's no man. It's just Bat...

18:14.733 --> 18:16.834
- Batman Mobile.
- ...Mobile. Batman Mobile.

18:16.869 --> 18:18.965
- Batmobile. Drop the man.
- Bat... Yeah.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.512
Batman Mobile.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.539
Batmobile.

18:22.574 --> 18:25.244
Batmo-mobile.

18:25.619 --> 18:29.859
So it was you who helped me through
my first breakup with Elizabeth?

18:30.469 --> 18:32.116
Yeah, Schmidt.

18:32.151 --> 18:35.720
And it was you,
<i>not</i> Keaton, who told me

18:35.754 --> 18:38.436
that women aren't attracted
to men who wear maternity pants?

18:38.457 --> 18:42.114
Yes, but that one I feel
like I shouldn't have had to.

18:42.115 --> 18:44.595
They're unbelevably
comfortable.

18:44.630 --> 18:46.898
What about that time
that we saw Michael Keaton

18:46.932 --> 18:51.379
at that deli,
and he stopped, and he winked?

18:51.410 --> 18:53.665
Honestly, I can't
explain that one.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.968
It was just the weirdest
day of my whole life.

18:56.508 --> 18:58.776
My friend Michael.

18:58.811 --> 19:04.148
Oh, Schmidt, look, I know
this is hard, okay?

19:04.776 --> 19:07.177
But honestly, I was
just trying to help.

19:08.383 --> 19:11.540
You don't need Keaton.
You got me.

19:11.603 --> 19:13.237
(shudders)

19:13.315 --> 19:16.227
- What was that?
- I'm so sorry.

19:16.261 --> 19:18.397
What... Why would you say
something like that?

19:18.398 --> 19:21.767
Because I hurt you, and I've been
wanting to fix this for years.

19:21.768 --> 19:24.635
The end of a high school
football movie?

19:24.670 --> 19:27.672
I'm really sorry I pretended to
be Keaton for the last 12 years.

19:27.706 --> 19:29.340
It's super weird.

19:30.843 --> 19:33.010
Are we good?

19:34.107 --> 19:37.409
Yeah. We're good.

19:45.557 --> 19:48.426
Well, Nicholas, I came
to a decision last night.

19:48.460 --> 19:52.092
I'm entering a new chapter in my life,
and I think it best that I do it alone.

19:52.093 --> 19:54.341
You're going to one of those
weekend spas again, buddy?

19:54.342 --> 19:56.981
No. In the famous words of
singer-songwriter Billy Joel...

19:56.982 --> 19:58.388
- Don't do this.
- I'm moving out.

19:58.389 --> 19:59.593
You're the worst.

19:59.609 --> 20:01.424
Schmidt, I thought
you said we were good.

20:01.425 --> 20:04.075
No, we're great, but I'm going.
Two separate things.

20:04.076 --> 20:06.751
I made the call this morning.
I got a new place. I'm out.

20:06.752 --> 20:09.113
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'm going.

20:09.148 --> 20:12.016
Goodness, uh, I think somebody
had sex in my bedroom last night.

20:12.017 --> 20:13.842
I think that because
they're still in there...

20:13.843 --> 20:15.244
- Having sex, I think.
- Ugh!

20:16.722 --> 20:18.873
Hey, Schmidt. You going
to a weekend spa again?

20:18.874 --> 20:21.225
- No. Striking out on my own.
- Wait. What?!

20:21.260 --> 20:23.277
You're moving out?
He's not moving out, is he?

20:23.278 --> 20:24.859
Schmidt, you can't move out.
Who's gonna do my fades?

20:24.860 --> 20:27.232
Yeah, who's gonna do his fades?
(sighs)

20:28.639 --> 20:30.307
Believe this is mine.

20:31.870 --> 20:34.372
Well, I bid you all adieu.

20:34.406 --> 20:36.040
- Stop it, Schmidt. Oh, Schmidt!
- Are you serious?

20:36.074 --> 20:37.678
- Schmidt, come on.
- Come on.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.362
- Seriously? Come on!
- Stop with the show!

20:39.363 --> 20:41.579
You can't even fit all
your socks in that suitcase.

20:41.613 --> 20:45.231
Get your last looks, 'cause who knows
when we'll see each other again?

20:45.851 --> 20:48.252
Or where.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.695
JESS: Wait. You're just
moving in across the hall?

20:57.729 --> 20:59.856
I can't hear you...
'cause I'm gone.

20:59.857 --> 21:02.228
NICK: Schmidt, it would take me
longer to walk from the kitchen

21:02.229 --> 21:05.770
to the bathroom than it would
from here to where you are.

21:05.804 --> 21:08.039
Oh, you are kidding me.

21:08.073 --> 21:10.381
- I can see your feet!
- Me, too.

21:10.382 --> 21:11.925
Shut up.

21:11.950 --> 21:13.950
Guy's an idiot...

21:13.975 --> 21:16.083
See you tomorrow, Schmidt...

21:17.164 --> 21:19.859
Woo! I'm alone!

21:19.884 --> 21:22.066
I'm alone! I'm alone...

21:22.222 --> 21:24.089
I'm alone...

21:28.872 --> 21:30.733
Score, touchd...

21:32.593 --> 21:35.718
Hahaha... Yeah.
Shut up, Winston.
