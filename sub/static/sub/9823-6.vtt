14:13.888 --> 14:15.155
No, no. That is not what we're...

14:15.189 --> 14:16.456

14:16.490 --> 14:18.258
that their residents are competent enough

14:18.292 --> 14:21.161
to be held to their contracts
but too incompetent to sue.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.695
So which is it?

14:22.730 --> 14:24.864
Many of the residents signed
their contracts years ago,

14:24.899 --> 14:27.500
and at the time,
they were perfectly competent.

14:27.535 --> 14:29.102

14:29.136 --> 14:31.538

you certainly paid your dues.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.501
I was very fortunate.

16:41.535 --> 16:43.670
HHM put me through law school
while I worked.

16:43.704 --> 16:46.172
That's great that
they foster talent like that.

16:53.647 --> 16:56.582

I was a year out of law school
at this firm in Boston,

17:02.189 --> 17:03.790
and I was finally put
on my first big case...

17:03.824 --> 17:06.592
this huge employment-discrimination suit.

17:06.627 --> 17:09.095
That thing kept us in billing for a decade.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.464
Anyway, we landed this monster,

17:11.498 --> 17:14.032

to one of the partners

17:14.068 --> 17:15.801

17:15.836 --> 17:18.171

the rest of my career."

that I can't afford...

17:25.913 --> 17:27.814

the opposing counsel.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.949
There's four of them, one senior partner

17:41.009 --> 17:42.506
and three high-level associates.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.631
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.

17:50.104 --> 17:51.404

they're calling us to order,

from my firm is coming.

18:04.885 --> 18:06.219
It's just me.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.221

18:08.255 --> 18:09.889
This is the moment."

18:09.923 --> 18:13.393

like my life depended on it.

statutes left and right.

said it was my trial by fire,

34:03.101 --> 34:04.601
- Well, you know...
- They could.

34:04.636 --> 34:06.403
I know, but they don't have to. [Laughs]

34:06.438 --> 34:08.272
We get it.

34:08.306 --> 34:10.674
It's possible,

34:10.708 --> 34:12.909
but I don't understand why that's an issue.

34:12.944 --> 34:14.610
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It can always go bad.

34:14.646 --> 34:18.815
Yeah, yeah. [Giggles]

34:18.850 --> 34:20.951
- Oh, Viktor, there you are.
- So sorry I'm late.

34:20.985 --> 34:23.020
- I had to put out a few fires.
- Not a problem.

34:23.054 --> 34:25.022
I made a new friend.
Dale, my brother, Viktor.

34:25.056 --> 34:27.357
- Hey, how ya doing?
- Oh, nice to meet you, Dale.

34:27.391 --> 34:29.460
- Thanks for keeping sis company.
- My pleasure.

34:29.494 --> 34:30.994
You need a drink.

34:31.029 --> 34:33.197
Let's get you a drink.

34:33.231 --> 34:35.632
So, what do you do, Dale?

34:35.667 --> 34:37.134
I'm an engineer.

34:37.168 --> 34:40.804

34:46.031 --> 34:47.531
I design things... spillways
and drainage fields, mostly.

34:48.379 --> 34:50.013
I don't... I don't actually build them.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.614
Well, that's cool, yeah.

34:51.649 --> 34:53.317
But you could still
wear the hat, though, right?

34:53.351 --> 34:55.452
[Both laugh] I mean, nothin stoppin' ya.

34:55.487 --> 34:57.221
Oh, yeah, I guess I could.

34:57.255 --> 34:59.323
I'm just saying, there's no rule
about that, as far as I know.

34:59.357 --> 35:01.225
Hey, you're such a brat. Why the good mood?

35:01.259 --> 35:03.460
Did it... go well today?

35:03.495 --> 35:06.330
Please tell me it went well.

35:06.364 --> 35:08.532
Yeah, it went well.

35:08.566 --> 35:11.668
Very well? Like, very, very...?

Whoo! [Chuckles]

35:17.075 --> 35:18.542
How many of these has she had?

35:18.576 --> 35:20.244
Mm! I am just getting started, baby.

35:21.713 --> 35:23.380
- Remember these faces, Dale.
- Giselle.

35:23.414 --> 35:24.982
They are gonna be on the cover
of <i> Fortune</i> magazine,

35:25.016 --> 35:26.416
- January issue.
- Giselle, please.

35:26.451 --> 35:27.318
No, Dale's a good guy.
He's not gonna do anything.

35:27.348 --> 35:29.249
- Yeah, you're boring the man.
- Oh, no, no, not really.

35:30.388 --> 35:31.889
Thank you.

35:31.923 --> 35:34.925
All right, I am off
to the little girl's room.

[Musetta's <i> "Red Star"</i> plays in background]

So, Giselle was telling me
you two are starting a business.

35:54.479 --> 35:56.780
What exactly did she tell you?

35:56.814 --> 35:58.382
Oh, nothing much.

35:58.416 --> 36:00.217
Just something about a dot com,

36:00.251 --> 36:02.719
some way for people
to hook up with each other

36:02.754 --> 36:04.188

36:07.825 --> 36:10.427
but she was talking out of school.

36:10.461 --> 36:13.397
- We're... We're full up on this thing.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

36:13.431 --> 36:15.132
We sign one more investor,

36:15.166 --> 36:17.367
we got to go public, and I'm just...

36:17.402 --> 36:19.303
No. [Chuckles]

36:19.337 --> 36:22.940
We cannot take anyone else on.

36:22.974 --> 36:24.441
No offense.

36:24.475 --> 36:26.977
Oh, it's okay. Yeah.

and you explain to him
that my nephew's gun was yours.
