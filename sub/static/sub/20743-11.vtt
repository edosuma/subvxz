<i>Previously on</i> The Bridge...

00:06.180 --> 00:07.180
Stop!

00:08.215 --> 00:09.549
Sonya, more are coming!

00:09.616 --> 00:10.450
Get out of here!

00:10.517 --> 00:11.818
I pretend to be the hero.

00:11.885 --> 00:14.120
The lie protects everyone.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.922
ABELARDO: Can you identify any of these men?

00:15.989 --> 00:17.023
EVA: Him.

00:17.091 --> 00:18.791
LINDER: H-Hold on a second here.

00:18.859 --> 00:21.668
We're-we're talking about
police officers from Juárez.

00:21.895 --> 00:23.196
You gonna protect her?

00:23.263 --> 00:25.164
- Did you arrest Robles?
- It's not that easy, Sonya.

00:25.232 --> 00:26.399
Why?

00:26.467 --> 00:28.367
Mexico City has Eva's affidavit.

00:28.435 --> 00:29.635
No, they don't.

00:29.703 --> 00:31.170
I think we can help each other.

00:31.238 --> 00:33.339
- I can work with that.
- Good.

00:33.407 --> 00:35.641
We keep a tight circle on this.

00:35.709 --> 00:38.044
Only you and Hank Wade.

00:38.112 --> 00:39.378
You sent me the Euro note?

00:39.446 --> 00:40.480
Maybe.

00:40.547 --> 00:42.915
He said to me the CIA has ordered them

00:42.983 --> 00:45.218
to back off the investigation.

00:45.285 --> 00:47.165
I'm betting that's the
guy who knows everything.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.188
ADRIANA: CIA.

SONYA: That's her.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.476
I said stop.

01:19.353 --> 01:20.686
Uh...

01:35.135 --> 01:36.002
Action.

01:40.674 --> 01:42.675

04:04.547 --> 04:06.792
I thought this was an
internal affairs audit.

04:06.818 --> 04:09.019
Yeah, well, two DEA agents

04:09.087 --> 04:11.755
lost their lives in that house,
Detective Cross.

04:11.823 --> 04:13.890
That makes it a federal investigation.

04:13.958 --> 04:15.859
Of course.

04:15.927 --> 04:17.827
I didn't get your name.

04:17.894 --> 04:22.031
I'm here in what you might
call an advisory mode only.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.468
Oh. What agency?

04:24.535 --> 04:26.937
Central Intelligence.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.940
Why is the CIA involved?

04:30.008 --> 04:32.676
That's classified, Detective.

04:32.744 --> 04:34.077
It's a national security matter.

04:34.145 --> 04:36.079
We'd like some perspective
on events that led

04:36.147 --> 04:37.948
to the shooting two days ago.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.336
I've already given a statement
to the police commission.

04:40.351 --> 04:41.818
Well, with all due respect,

04:41.886 --> 04:43.954
this falls outside their jurisdiction.

04:44.022 --> 04:47.290
We had a Mexican drug
massacre in a gated community.

04:47.358 --> 04:49.311
There will be blowback.

04:49.337 --> 04:50.921
<i>Mucho</i> blowback.

04:50.947 --> 04:53.905
The CIA was interfering with Agent McKenzie.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.101
For the unenlightened,
perhaps you could walk us

04:58.169 --> 05:00.704
through this wild speculation.

05:01.778 --> 05:03.858
Hank and I were working with Agent McKenzie

05:03.880 --> 05:06.082
on the Eleanor Nacht case.

05:06.149 --> 05:09.331
Agent McKenzie never filed a
report on his investigation.

05:09.357 --> 05:11.595
- That's correct.
- Do you know why?

05:11.621 --> 05:13.622
He believed that the CIA

05:13.690 --> 05:16.292
was preventing him from
getting Fausto Galvan.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.929
He said we were preventing
the DEA from doing its job?

05:19.996 --> 05:22.198
Cock-blocking.

05:22.265 --> 05:23.532
That's how he put it.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.034
We read your report.

05:25.102 --> 05:26.102
It's very thorough.

05:26.103 --> 05:28.204
Then what's the point of this?

05:28.271 --> 05:29.905
Detective Cross, this massacre

05:29.973 --> 05:34.910
represents a very serious
threat to our border security.

05:34.978 --> 05:37.012
You had a role in it.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.483
As I stated,
I was approached by Agent McKenzie.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.451
To run an off-the-books operation?

05:45.021 --> 05:48.424
Answer the question, please.

05:49.459 --> 05:52.061
Yes.

05:52.129 --> 05:54.089
He wanted to apprehend Fausto Galvan,

05:54.131 --> 05:56.065
and I wanted to arrest Eleanor Nacht.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.134
We made a deal.

05:58.201 --> 06:00.161
That didn't exactly go to plan, did it?

06:01.616 --> 06:03.584
I need to interview her.

06:06.315 --> 06:09.918
Miss Nacht's interview is
being handled by the DOJ.

06:09.944 --> 06:12.212
Any contact with her would be obstruction

06:12.238 --> 06:14.718
of a federal investigation.

06:16.319 --> 06:18.521
Are you taking the case away from me?

06:18.588 --> 06:20.468
It was never your case, Detective.

06:21.892 --> 06:24.913
Eleanor Nacht killed an innocent kid,

06:25.002 --> 06:27.403
and nobody seems to really care.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.676
Detective Cross,

06:28.702 --> 06:31.367
were there any additional
items left at the house

06:31.435 --> 06:34.470
prior to your surrendering it to DEA?

06:34.538 --> 06:36.806
Paperwork and stuff like that.

06:36.873 --> 06:40.876
Everything is on the inventory list.

06:42.045 --> 06:45.269
You're not currently taking
any medications?

06:45.882 --> 06:47.817
What?

06:47.884 --> 06:49.452
There's a, um,

06:49.519 --> 06:52.788
diagnosis in your personnel file.

06:55.459 --> 06:56.859
No.

06:56.927 --> 06:59.061
I'm not taking medications currently,

06:59.129 --> 07:00.696
and I'm not sure

07:00.764 --> 07:03.065
what that has to do with this investigation.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.568
It's just a question.

07:05.635 --> 07:09.038
Thank you for your time, Detective.

08:02.270 --> 08:03.704
FRYE: How's Luce?

08:03.772 --> 08:06.073
ADRIANA: She gets her stitches out tomorrow.

08:06.141 --> 08:08.075
Oh, yuck.

08:08.143 --> 08:12.012
Guess there's no 21-gun salute
for Agent Joe McKenzie, huh?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.814
There she is.

08:17.953 --> 08:20.955
Remind me to get cremated, will you?

08:27.128 --> 08:29.063
Hello.

08:29.856 --> 08:31.657
Our condolences, Mrs. McKenzie.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.235
I'm sorry. How did you know Joe?

08:34.302 --> 08:37.580
Well, we... sort of worked with him.

08:39.441 --> 08:41.609
You don't look like DEA.

08:42.777 --> 08:45.412
I work for <i> The El Paso Times.</i>

08:45.480 --> 08:48.182
And I... used to.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.517
This is my husband's funeral.

08:50.585 --> 08:52.319
I've already talked to reporters, thank you.

08:52.387 --> 08:53.687
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

08:53.755 --> 08:58.088
Just, um, could you please tell us
if you recognize this writing?

08:58.693 --> 09:01.173
Your husband reached out to us.

09:01.229 --> 09:04.365
- Did he ever talk to you about his work?
- No.

09:04.432 --> 09:08.002
Mostly baseball and Dungeons & Dragons.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.203
Dungeons & Dragons?

09:09.271 --> 09:11.472
He never talked to you about anything else?

09:15.377 --> 09:17.778
He had a...

09:17.846 --> 09:21.448
special project in the garage or something.

09:22.042 --> 09:24.310
Maybe we could take a look at that?

09:24.336 --> 09:27.055
They told me not to touch anything.
DEA's picking it up.

09:27.455 --> 09:30.557
- We wouldn't take up too much of your time.
- No, it's...

09:30.625 --> 09:33.928
We are so sorry that we bothered you.

09:33.995 --> 09:36.475
If I could just...

09:36.671 --> 09:38.672
We are very sorry.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.708
It's fine.

09:47.776 --> 09:50.644
Go, go, go, go. Ready?

09:50.712 --> 09:53.013
Go, go, go.

09:54.049 --> 09:55.149
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

09:55.216 --> 09:57.151
FRYE: Go.

09:57.218 --> 09:59.153
- Go, go, go, go.
- What is it?

09:59.220 --> 10:02.323
What is that, Joe's special project?

10:02.390 --> 10:04.158
"Yankee."

10:04.225 --> 10:05.759
Here. Can you grab this?

10:05.827 --> 10:08.095
Yeah, yeah, grab that.

10:08.163 --> 10:09.363
- You got it?
- Yeah.

10:09.431 --> 10:12.132
I got the other one. Come on.

10:26.948 --> 10:28.949
(knocking)

10:37.225 --> 10:39.825
- Hey.
- SONYA: Hey.

10:40.228 --> 10:41.695
How's Hank?

10:41.763 --> 10:43.697
Better.

10:43.765 --> 10:47.501
I'm off the Nacht case.

10:47.569 --> 10:49.636
DEA's taking over.

10:49.704 --> 10:51.638
Of course they are.

10:51.706 --> 10:53.440
CIA's involved, too.

10:53.508 --> 10:58.379
Well, that's not gonna help
to find Fausto, you know?

10:58.446 --> 11:01.248
(sighs)

11:01.464 --> 11:03.832
I think I know where he is.

11:04.719 --> 11:06.120
How?

11:06.335 --> 11:09.337
My father had a hideout. Look.

11:10.692 --> 11:12.659
In the old days,

11:12.727 --> 11:14.661
after I left home,

11:14.729 --> 11:17.798
Fausto and him became... closer.

11:17.866 --> 11:20.934
That's when they began working together.

11:21.002 --> 11:23.404
That him? Yep.

11:23.463 --> 11:26.332
He became my dad's favorite son.

11:26.408 --> 11:28.342
How are you gonna get to him?

11:28.410 --> 11:30.477
The Marines, maybe.

11:30.545 --> 11:33.447
Have you asked them already? No, not yet.

11:33.515 --> 11:35.482
There is this, um, state prosecutor.

11:35.550 --> 11:38.519
He might be able to get me in with them.

11:39.921 --> 11:43.290
But... first, I need to come clean.

11:43.783 --> 11:46.351
I need to tell the truth about what happened

11:46.377 --> 11:48.011
in that hotel room.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.932
It would help if you came with me.

11:58.231 --> 12:00.433
(reporter speaking Spanish)

12:04.779 --> 12:06.780
(phone chimes)

12:28.303 --> 12:31.238
(Romina coughing)

12:31.306 --> 12:33.273
(grunts, coughs)

12:38.012 --> 12:40.247
We have a...

12:46.863 --> 12:48.530
(mutters)

12:52.160 --> 12:54.428
(Romina gasping)

12:54.496 --> 12:57.798
(gasping, gags)

13:05.746 --> 13:09.606
- SONYA: No. He did it to protect me.
- Okay.

13:09.783 --> 13:12.918
I know about your father and Fausto Galvan.

13:12.986 --> 13:14.987
I want to get him.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.255
Do you know where he's hiding?

13:19.439 --> 13:21.373
That's a suicide mission.

13:28.218 --> 13:31.383
And what are the Americans doing
in the wake of the violence?

13:31.409 --> 13:33.010
We want Fausto, too.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.912
Perhaps.

13:34.979 --> 13:37.915
See, we Mexicans have the virtue
of an openly corrupt system.

13:37.982 --> 13:40.751
You know, things are more clear.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.753
You Americans cloak your corruption

13:42.821 --> 13:45.889
behind patriotism, the drug war, the wall.

13:45.957 --> 13:47.157
<i>Señor, señor, perdón.</i>

13:47.225 --> 13:48.726
We-we didn't come here for a lecture.

13:48.793 --> 13:50.260
These are the facts.

13:50.328 --> 13:52.285
Drug money is too important
to both of our economies.

13:52.311 --> 13:53.611
I'm here as a cop.

13:53.894 --> 13:56.266
I'm asking your help as a justice official.

13:56.334 --> 13:58.435
Can you arrange a meeting with <i> la Marina?</i>

13:58.503 --> 14:01.004
I will deliver Fausto,

14:01.072 --> 14:03.540
but on my own terms.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.949
Oh.

14:12.016 --> 14:14.952
Yeah, I feel it now.

14:15.019 --> 14:17.488
That cool breeze.

14:17.555 --> 14:19.223
See? I told you.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.226
It comes down from the mountains

14:22.293 --> 14:24.294
every afternoon.

14:27.599 --> 14:30.400
Mmm.

14:30.468 --> 14:33.003
I think you should shave your beard.

14:35.707 --> 14:39.977
My-my beard affords me special powers.

14:40.044 --> 14:42.846
Inscrutability,

14:42.914 --> 14:46.150
disguise, deception.

14:48.119 --> 14:50.154
You don't need that anymore.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.691
I want to see your face.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.635
(grunts)

15:06.538 --> 15:08.939
(mutters softly)

15:09.007 --> 15:12.543
Yeah. Uh, would you use lather?

15:15.146 --> 15:17.147
Yes.

15:19.717 --> 15:23.253
Yeah. Uh, I could like that.

15:28.326 --> 15:29.775
What?

15:38.570 --> 15:41.538
It sickens me what he did to you.

15:41.606 --> 15:44.842
I will hasten him off this planet.

15:46.878 --> 15:48.345
I didn't know he had children.

15:48.413 --> 15:50.314
(grunts)

15:50.381 --> 15:52.249
(hisses) Ah. Ah.

16:40.598 --> 16:43.634
Okay?

17:32.784 --> 17:34.785
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

17:39.190 --> 17:41.191
(wheezes, exhales)

17:42.593 --> 17:43.833
Hank.

17:45.163 --> 17:46.697
Hank.

17:50.234 --> 17:52.235
Welcome back.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.706
Mm...

17:58.109 --> 17:59.576
Did we get 'em?

18:00.878 --> 18:02.879
Eleanor.

18:04.482 --> 18:07.317
Feds took over the investigation.

18:07.385 --> 18:09.353
