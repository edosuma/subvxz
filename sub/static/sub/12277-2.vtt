WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.249
CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:02.419 --> 00:05.627
You wouldn't want
to miss this. It's an
historic moment for Eureka.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.288
I think that we should
move in together.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.628
I need to figure out
what I want.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.585
I'll be thinking about you.

00:14.681 --> 00:15.670
Huh.

00:16.308 --> 00:20.392
Walkabout. Safe travels, Jo.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.723
COMPUTER: Launch sequence
initiating.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.684
Someone else is
controlling this launch.

00:28.904 --> 00:29.893
Where'd they go?

00:31.782 --> 00:34.148
We're in an uncontrolled
descent! Brace for impact!

00:38.789 --> 00:41.701
Hey, folks,
welcome back.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.291
There's been a lot
of changes since
you've been gone.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.497
This is Jenna.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.497
It's very nice
to meet you.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.666
CARTER: You were gone
for four years, Allie.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.050
It was Jo who
pulled me back.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.557
Jo's in Jenna's life
now and I can't take
that from her.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.594
CARTER: I'm really
sorry, Allie.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.053
DEKKER: She's crying.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.561
BEVERLY: Because
everything she's experiencing
feels absolutely real to her.

01:04.731 --> 01:10.101
She's emotionally invested
in the reality she's just
helped create. We all are.

01:10.279 --> 01:15.399
The greatest minds in Eureka
are working for us now and
they don't even know it.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.243
BEVERLY: The Astraeus and
her crew have been gone
for a month.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.285
Soon, Eureka will
have to accept that loss.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.912
And, meanwhile, the greatest
scientists of our time

01:30.090 --> 01:32.502
are wired into an artificial
world that we control.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.759
They have no idea
that what they're
experiencing isn't real,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.716
but what they design in
that construct is very real.

01:38.890 --> 01:39.800
DEKKER: And useful.

01:39.975 --> 01:44.139
In the last month they've
made strides in biotech,
engineering and weaponry.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.349
We're about to give them
the problem of genetics.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.605
All of these scientific
discoveries belong to us.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.687
That's very impressive, but
how long can you sustain this?

01:51.862 --> 01:55.775
lndefinitely.
The photonic plasma
processor makes trillions

01:55.949 --> 02:00.568
of real-time adjustments
in order to keep the world
feeling authentic.

02:00.746 --> 02:04.455
So authentic that a severe
virtual trauma could trigger
a fatal neurogenic shock.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.287
These are smart people,
Dr. Barlowe.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.042
What if they start
to question their world?

02:09.212 --> 02:11.464
Or the non-player characters
who are there with them?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.964
That's why we chose to put
them in a future reality.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.626
It's impossible to recreate
Eureka perfectly. So by
changing the town,

02:17.804 --> 02:20.341
we reduce inconsistencies
our subjects might recognize.

02:20.515 --> 02:26.351
But should a subject threaten
to expose the construct,
they will be retired.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.823
Allison can you hear me?
We got to get them
out of there.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.159
What happens to Dr. Blake
if the ship launches?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.370
Without the bio-pod to
protect her from
gravitational stresses,

02:49.544 --> 02:51.375
the only chance she
has is the jump seat.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.376
Well, I'm getting her
out of there.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.287
I can't let you do that!
It's too dangerous!

02:54.466 --> 02:55.706
Oh, fire me!

03:02.766 --> 03:03.755
Jack!

03:12.943 --> 03:14.433
(SIREN WAILING)

03:14.611 --> 03:17.478
If he breaches the cooling
chambers, the core centers
will shut down,

03:17.656 --> 03:19.021
to keep the reactor
from overheating.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.735
Come on. Come on, Jack.
Come on.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.283
(GRUNTING)

03:23.453 --> 03:26.286
COMPUTER: Warning, reactor
core overheating.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.340
Where are you?

03:48.395 --> 03:49.384
Anything?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.100
Nothing new.

03:57.904 --> 03:58.893
How about you?

04:01.992 --> 04:06.986
I've tested the system over
a dozen times and there is
no evidence of sabotage.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.992
Well, we'll find 'em.
We just keep looking.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.868
Where? I mean it's been
a month and still no leads.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.038
It's like they vanished
without a trace, Jack.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.751
Everything leaves a trace.
Yeah.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.721
When was the last time
you ate?

04:26.892 --> 04:28.803
I'm not hungry. I'm just
going to start the tapes
and take a look.

04:28.977 --> 04:33.266
You know what? Why don't you
take a break and have lunch
with the kids?

04:34.149 --> 04:35.685
They need you too.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.067
Thanks.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.313
Okay.
Okay.

04:49.372 --> 04:53.991
Okay, universe,
I am ready.
Enlighten me.

04:58.715 --> 05:02.674
Any time now.
Uh-huh. Bring it on.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.005
(SEAGULLS CAWING LOUDLY)

05:07.641 --> 05:09.177
I should have gone
to the desert.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.429
Should've read the sign.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.229
Oh, no! Oh, Okay,
it said beach parking.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.563
You need a permit.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.904
Look, I'm at a bit of
a crossroads in my life

05:28.078 --> 05:29.409
and, uh...

05:30.080 --> 05:33.698
And I know it sounds flakey,
a friend told me to
go on walkabout.

05:33.875 --> 05:38.369
So, if you could just give
me just a small break
this one time,

05:38.547 --> 05:42.210
you know, it would
really help my positive
outlook thing.

05:42.801 --> 05:47.090
Yeah. Sorry.
Here's the number
for a cab.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.879
You have a nice day.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.887
You don't bring
a cell phone on walkabout.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.055
Thanks, universe.

06:01.486 --> 06:05.195
Here you go. Grilled cheese
with fontina and aged gouda.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.069
Best comfort food
on the planet.

06:08.243 --> 06:12.156
If there is anything else
I can do, please just
let me know.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.706
Thanks, Vince.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.492
He sounds worried.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.873
Oh, we're all a
little worried. Yeah.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.912
Well, he won't be when
I finish my scanner.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.877
You see, I've been
thinking that

06:25.051 --> 06:28.543
punching through a wormhole
has to produce a mess
of strangelets.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.711
The what's-its?

06:29.890 --> 06:33.553
They're theoretical particles
equally composed of up,
down, and strange quarks.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.846
See, that's like answering
a question with a question.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.605
First off, I have to prove
that strangelets
actually exist.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.727
That's going to be rough.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.565
Well, you just, you keep
at it, with that what
you're doing.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.197
Hey guys. Um, boss,
can I talk to you
for a minute?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.274
Sure.
Is it about the ship?

06:51.453 --> 06:54.661
Hey, did you
find something?
No, Kevin, we didn't.

06:54.831 --> 06:59.951
Well, look, if it's about my mom,
I want to know, okay?
So what's going on?

07:05.842 --> 07:09.835
The Department of Defense
has officially called off the
search for the Astraeus.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.844
I'm so sorry.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.801
Well, they can't.

07:13.975 --> 07:18.264
Senator Wen says she's
exhausted all of her resources
and no sign of the Astraeus,

07:18.438 --> 07:22.602
they think the chances
of finding any survivors
are poor.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.901
Jack, Jack, you can't
let them do this.
Kevin.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.407
You can'tjust stop looking!

07:32.577 --> 07:35.034
Kevin, I'll talk
to the Senator, okay?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.328
Kevin!

07:45.590 --> 07:48.673
R.F. rate is
down again.
25.2.

07:48.843 --> 07:52.256
Cut resolution in grids
fifteen through
one-seventy-eight.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.227
JENNA: Almost.
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

08:01.606 --> 08:03.642
Darn it. You are good at this.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.934
Thanks. You are too.
I'll let you win next time.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.726
(LAUGHS)

08:09.739 --> 08:12.276
Oh, this looks like fun.
You want to play the winner?

08:12.659 --> 08:16.902
Well, | wish I could but
I have to kidnap your mom
for a little while.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.197
The next batch of biological
experiments needs to
come off the Astraeus

08:20.375 --> 08:22.536
and the DOD. ordered
protocols for a genetic study.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.121
They could give us
a moment to
catch our breath.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.877
It's been one assignment
after another since
we got back.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.506
I know. I'm finally carving
out time to review
the flight data.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.919
You mean you're going to
find out why my mom was
gone for so long?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.588
I am just glad
I'm back now, right?

08:37.434 --> 08:39.220
Jo, I won Uno.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.686
Oh, good job. I'm so proud.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.768
Are you okay?
Do I have a choice?

08:45.942 --> 08:49.434
Doesn't seem real, does it?
Everything that's happened.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.227
No.

08:51.406 --> 08:55.024
Hey, I'm going out to
the Astraeus to help you
with the offload.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.825
Great. Let's go.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.998
VINCE: Goodbye, Allison.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.415
No.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.711
Tell me she didn't see that.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.139
What just happened there?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.183
A real-time
render error.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.309
Because the system was
designed for 20 people,

09:24.481 --> 09:27.063
not 20 plus one last
minute RSVP.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.144
Dr. Blake was
a lucky accident.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.106
Her presence is overloading
the processor.
She shouldn't be here.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.441
It wasn't our decision
to make. We follow orders.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.153
Yeah. From people who don't
understand the system
the way I do.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.911
I don't have
the authority to deviate
and neither do you.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.330
I want to thank everyone
for your efforts.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.496
I know this is
difficult for all of us.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.631
Senator Wen!
You have to keep searching!

09:53.802 --> 09:58.592
Sheriff, you have no idea how
hard this decision was for me.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.551
Then don't make it.
Don't call off the search.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.717
l have pulled in every
resource at my disposal,

10:03.895 --> 10:06.056
satellites, space-based
radar systems...

10:06.231 --> 10:07.812
And I appreciate
everything you've done.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.224
And these devices
need to get back to
doing theirjobs.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.520
And so do you.
I'm doing myjob.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.737
Then you can help Dr. Fong
recover his stolen equipment.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.114
I don't care about his stolen
equipment right now.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.246
I know you're grieving,
Sheriff, so I won't take
that personally.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.907
I'm not grieving.
I'm searching.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.828
I truly hope you're
right, Sheriff.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.838
But I also think
you need to

10:34.008 --> 10:38.251
prepare yourself for the
likelihood that they're
not coming back.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.262
It's time to turn your
focus back to this world.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.885
Good day, gentlemen.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.344
Yeah.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.606
So what's your problem?

10:52.026 --> 10:52.811
When I started packing up,

10:52.986 --> 10:55.978
some of my deep space
listening devices were
taken from the truck.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.319
Particle detectors just
taken right off Main Street.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.608
You know, sometimes
I wonder what this town
is coming to.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.072
I think I know where
they might be.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.955
You're not making
my job any easier, Kev.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.118
I wasn't trying to.
I needed the stuff
so I took it.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.163
I'm going to pretend that
you said "borrow it" and
we're going to take it back.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.797
You can't be stealing
top secret equipment, Kevin.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.168
You think they're dead?

11:25.602 --> 11:28.435
Kevin...
No, seriously, in your gut, do
you think that my mom is dead?

11:29.397 --> 11:32.230
No. I can't believe that.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.985
All right, me either. Can you
please just let me do
one more thing, all right?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.692
Look, I know I can
find them. Please.

11:41.659 --> 11:46.028
Not this way.
Pack up the stuff.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.988
We're going.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.502
JO: So, what's in here?

11:58.676 --> 12:01.167
Biological experiments
we were taking to Titan.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.052
Biological as in rats?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.965
Rats, worms, insects,
even reptiles.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.305
There's a study on
the effects of solar wind

12:09.479 --> 12:12.767
on the reproductive systems
of bearded iguanas.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.307
That's a career maker.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.818
Kevin wants an iguana.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.821
Or he did when
he was younger.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.653
He thought they
were dragons.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.947
Jenna loves dragons.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.785
Really?
Yeah. I read her The Hobbit
last year.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.701
She made me read the part
about the dragon
over and over again.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.336
And then she'd get scared
and want to sleep in our bed.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.331
Sorry.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.342
No. Don't be.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.339
(BANGING)

12:49.227 --> 12:50.467
What is that?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.767
Sounds big.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.223
(GROWLING)

13:00.363 --> 13:01.569
Move!

13:06.744 --> 13:08.245
(ALARMS BEEPING)

13:08.788 --> 13:09.903
What is it?

13:10.081 --> 13:14.120
The rendering algorithm is
cycling independently and
I don't have any control.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.704
Get control.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.203
JO: Down! Everybody, down!

13:24.512 --> 13:25.968
What was that?
I don't know!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.095
Cool. I love dragons.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.519
BEVERLY: That's quite
a glitch, Mr. Dekker.

13:38.943 --> 13:43.357
It's supposed to be a
genetically altered squamate,
about ten inches long,

13:43.531 --> 13:45.692
but what that is,
I don't know.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.324
Really? Because
I saw a dragon.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.954
The program constructs the
reality by using the memories
of the participant cortices.

13:53.124 --> 13:57.288
But there's an algorithm
that filters any
imaginary elements.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.623
Clearly it's malfunctioning.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.755
We're pushing the logic
processor too hard.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.543
We can restart the genetic
assignment with another animal

14:06.721 --> 14:08.552
and I will delete
the creature.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.965
No. We've already done enough
to make the crew start to
question things.

14:12.852 --> 14:17.346
That creature needs to be
eliminated in a way that feels
believable to them.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.648
Honestly, Doug, a dragon?

14:21.819 --> 14:23.855
But you weren't here.
It had the claws
and the wings!

14:24.030 --> 14:27.648
That doesn't change the fact
that dragons are mythical,
as in mythical.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.032
Mythical is just another word
for not yet discovered.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.660
Dr. Blake, want to help
me educate a skeptic?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.821
Fargo, I'm a bit
skeptical myself.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.116
I'm talking about dragons
and one suddenly appears?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.159
Well, do you have
another explanation?

14:40.338 --> 14:43.330
Chemical exposure.
A big breath of
EA 48 nerve gas

14:43.508 --> 14:44.623
and you would
be seeing Elvis

14:44.801 --> 14:47.543
driving Santa's sleigh
being pulled by
a team of dragons.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.462
First, we're going to deal
with the dragon, then Elvis.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.596
That was just
a for instance.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.473
I'll run some tests. Bye.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.598
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.685
I'm feeling slightly insane.
But othen/vise peachy.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.360
Well, we're going to track
it down. Whatever it is.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.393
Oh, you can track
down a hallucination?

15:05.571 --> 15:09.029
I'm that good. Actually Jo's
at G.D. getting weapons.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.532
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, we're just
going to kill it?

15:11.953 --> 15:14.490
Well, if we have to. We've got
stop it from doing fly-bys
at Portland Airport.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.120
So we capture it.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.281
And do you have any
dragon tranquilizers?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.285
We can use a super
symmetrical particle net.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.671
Experimental enclosure
made of sub-atomic strings.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.709
No one has made one that
has lasted longer than
a microsecond.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.092
I will call Zane,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.925
I've been noodling some
news to overcome
the Yukawa potential.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.052
It's worth a try,
at least before
we slay it.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.264
DEKKER: We have to
clean up this mess.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.557
This mess could inspire them
to create super symmetric
particle netting,

15:43.734 --> 15:45.770
which would be
an incredible advance.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.109
I'll call for further
instructions.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.988
No. Just do what I say.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.283
Use the Carter N.P.C.
And get them on task.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.614
Yes. You get Zane to help you.
Yes!

16:03.004 --> 16:05.245
Feel like a walk
in the woods?

16:05.423 --> 16:10.167
Whatever this thing is you
got a good look at it and
I could use your help.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.295
Okay.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.435
You look tired.
And beautiful.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.985
You wouldn't want to give me
a hand with that phosphor
cryo-module, would you?

16:30.156 --> 16:33.740
No, I can't. I have tons of
Astraeus launch telemetry
to go through.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.025
VVhy?

16:37.121 --> 16:40.284
Because I'm the captain,
Henry. It was my mission
and I need answers.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.993
Grace, you know
the answer. We found it.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.080
And after a year's
investigation it
was an accident.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.918
A faulty resonator chip.
It was an accident.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.964
I need to get back to this.
You sure?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.507
Your loss.

17:04.607 --> 17:09.192
$286. Hmm.
Thanks, universe.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.541
Whoo-hoo!

17:29.423 --> 17:30.048
Ow!

17:32.260 --> 17:34.967
Jo, what did you do?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.461
Hi, Dad.

17:37.848 --> 17:41.090
Excuse me. What the
hell are you doing?

17:41.727 --> 17:47.313
Hi. Sorry. I used to live here
when l was a little girl.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.517
Are you Lupo?
Yes.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.357
Yeah, I think I got a message
for you. Stay there.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.068
Oh, the universe finally
has something to tell me.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.734
It's weird that it's coming
from her. So, what's
the message?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.699
They're all from
the same guy, Carter.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.032
Tell him to stop calling
me for crap's sake.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.074
Carter?

18:07.253 --> 18:09.414
Yeah. He says it's
an emergency.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.792
Don't you have a cell phone?

18:12.717 --> 18:16.084
You don't bring a cell
phone on walkabout!

18:18.389 --> 18:21.677
So I don't know what to do.
I mean, I want to
stay positive,

18:21.851 --> 18:24.217
but I don't want to give the
kids false hope. Here you go.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.852
No, thanks.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.481
And it's hard, right? Because
I don't want to set them up to
be crushed either.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.766
Right.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.026
Right.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.362
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:37.533 --> 18:41.401
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just astounded
at what Kevin's done.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.744
Yes, grand larceny
is impressive.

18:43.914 --> 18:48.283
This is beyond brilliant.
I mean he's actually designed
a strangelet detector.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.702
Yeah, those are the particles
he was talking about.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.997
This device could actually be
sensitive enough to pick up
their energy signature.

18:55.718 --> 18:56.798
What do you mean?

18:56.969 --> 19:00.837
It is possible to see the path
of the ship. It's a long shot.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.552
The wake could have faded by
now. We don't have much time!

19:03.726 --> 19:06.183
Kevin, you want to come
down for a sec?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.357
I did my homework
and I cleaned my room

19:10.524 --> 19:11.809
but I'm not going to
say I'm sorry
because I'm not.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.064
No, Kevin, just...

19:15.154 --> 19:16.269
Um...

19:18.491 --> 19:20.322
What do you need
to finish this?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.535
You serious?

19:31.337 --> 19:35.080
Ah, well, when everybody found
out what you're up to
they wanted to help out.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.212
This is amazing.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.127
All right, well, we've got
just about everything.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.918
I still need an
arc-second pulse array.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.052
Done!

19:42.223 --> 19:43.508
Tell me what it is
and I'm on it!

19:43.683 --> 19:47.722
It's a, frequency enhancer
found on ultra large
antennae dishes.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.556
I actually think I know where
to find one of those things.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.142
But I'm going to need a
little help with security.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.649
Andy, just the man
l was looking for.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.733
Gee, thanks, boss.
For an Al.
that's mighty touching.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.772
I think I might need your
help with something.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.489
Would it be building
a strangelet detector
out of stolen equipment?

20:05.663 --> 20:06.869
Why would you say that?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.904
I've been noting the stream
of devices passing by.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.539
l was going to make
a mass arrest later on.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.248
I think you might need to
forget about being a deputy
for a little while.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.457
(LAUGHING)

20:15.631 --> 20:17.212
I don't actually forget
anything, Sheriff.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.090
I can tell you what socks
you were wearing every day
since my activation.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.628
Not forget, um, ignore.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.016
See, we need to borrow
one last piece of equipment.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.929
That sounds dangerously
like conspiracy to commit
a felony, Sheriff.

20:33.107 --> 20:36.474
It does, and dangerously
similar,

20:39.989 --> 20:42.822
but this might be our last
chance to find the crew
of the Astraeus.

20:46.078 --> 20:46.863
So what do you say?

20:48.748 --> 20:53.583
I say, that if it were
my SARAH up there, I would do
anything to bring her back.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.702
Great.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.209
So what do you think we're
looking for? If anything.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.000
Well, the Astraeus
has thousands of
genetic experiments.

21:03.179 --> 21:06.091
I don't know what kind of
mutations could occur.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.972
And if it's a lizard,
how big are we talking?
How big do they get?

21:09.143 --> 21:12.431
Well, monitor lizards
can grow up
to 10 feet long.

21:13.939 --> 21:14.928
That's awesome.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.774
We haven't done
this in a while.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.195
What, track a dragon?

21:20.362 --> 21:23.445
Yeah something crazy
like that. I missed it.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.027
Don't say that. You don't
think this is hard
enough as it is?

21:30.498 --> 21:31.658
Sorry.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.948
(BRANCHES BREAKING)

21:37.505 --> 21:38.961
What? What is it?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.004
Oh, hey, hi.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.298
What are you doing here?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.057
Looking for whatever
it was you all saw,

21:52.228 --> 21:55.846
which, for the record,
I'm absolutely sure
was not a dragon.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.102
Oh.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.982
Holly. Holly,
where are you going?

22:02.112 --> 22:04.148
(GROWLING)

22:08.327 --> 22:11.114
Oh. Do you guys
see this too?
Yes.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.949
Holy Stromboli.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.409
Step away from the dragon.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.699
What?

22:20.548 --> 22:23.255
Jo, we got it.
Holly.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.124
I told you.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.633
No, but Holly, don't. Don't!

22:26.804 --> 22:29.136
Don't worry, it's not real.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.298
(SCREECHING)

22:33.811 --> 22:35.347
(SCREAMING)
Holly!

22:51.579 --> 22:52.739
Ow!

22:56.458 --> 22:59.700
ALLISON: Oh, I'm sorry
it hurts.
Yeah. Isn't that cool?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.746
You don't know what kind of
dragon bacteria that thing
has under its nails.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.879
Doug, let's look
at this logically.

23:05.050 --> 23:09.214
A. My arm totally hurts.
B. It hurts because it was
scratched by a dragon.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.175
C. Dragons don't exist,
therefore...

23:14.727 --> 23:16.137
Therefore what?

23:18.272 --> 23:20.513
I don't know.
That's why it's so cool.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.556
Okay. I'm going to get
you wrapped up,

23:22.735 --> 23:24.691
get you a shot of
wide-spectrum antibiotics

23:24.862 --> 23:27.103
and then you can get
out of here.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.775
So how is this cool?

23:32.953 --> 23:36.070
Oh, well, Holly has
a unique view on the world.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.161
You both did see something
before it skittered
off in the woods?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.289
Yeah. It kind of blinked
out for a second.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.830
Well, lizards can
change color, right?
That camouflage thing?

23:46.008 --> 23:48.920
Right. Cryptic colorization.
No, it wasn't
like that at all.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.756
Okay, um, you were
both on the Astraeus.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.764
Could the FTL jump
have done something like that?

23:54.934 --> 24:00.019
Well, visual recognition
involves large part of the
ventral stream in the brain.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.271
It's a delicate structure.
I mean it's possible.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.228
Since when do you know so much
about neuroscience?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.391
Night school.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.563
Yeah, um, look, I'm going
to go check on Zane.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.072
He's almost done the
dragon, uh, capture...

24:12.242 --> 24:13.982
Super symmetric
particle netting.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.402
Exactly. Yeah.

24:20.876 --> 24:21.865
Holly?

24:22.044 --> 24:25.662
Oh, she's fine. She'll be
all healed up in
about a week or two.

24:25.839 --> 24:29.582
And you get to put
"dragon attack" on
your mission report.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.923
Allison,

24:34.098 --> 24:37.090
can you think of any reason
why Henry wouldn't want me to

24:37.267 --> 24:39.428
go through the records
of the launch?

24:39.603 --> 24:41.434
No, it's yourjob.
You're the captain.

24:41.605 --> 24:46.349
No, I know, itjust felt
like he didn't want
me poking around.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.483
Really?

24:48.946 --> 24:52.564
Henry is probably one
of the most curious people
that I've ever met.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.447
He loves a good mystery
more than anyone.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.826
Oh, it's for Holly.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.582
Are we really looking
for a dragon?

25:03.752 --> 25:07.370
I don't know what Holly would
say, but in my book if
something hurts you,

25:07.548 --> 25:08.583
then it's real.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.096
This is so exciting!
What's the plan, boss?

25:25.274 --> 25:30.143
What we want is inside that
building. So you go in,
grab the array,

25:30.320 --> 25:32.106
I'll keep watch.
Great.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.909
The only thing is the massive
electrical fields in that
building

25:39.371 --> 25:43.330
might disable my CPU.
So better yet, you go
and I'll keep watch.

25:45.919 --> 25:46.908
Supeh

25:53.093 --> 25:57.462
Hey, boss, my sensors read
about 6700 megawatts
bouncing around in there.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.628
Wish me luck!

26:02.853 --> 26:05.515
Okay. Good luck, boss.
Thank you.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.696
Oh!

26:24.958 --> 26:27.825
Where are you? Okay.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.673
Where are you?

26:37.930 --> 26:38.919
Nice.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.022
Bingo.

27:04.790 --> 27:05.996
Ow!

27:21.515 --> 27:23.506
(GROANING)

27:27.062 --> 27:29.678
MAN: Freeze!
Oh, oh!

27:29.857 --> 27:31.518
Who are you?

27:32.109 --> 27:34.521
l'm Deputy Andy,
local law enforcement.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.650
Oh, come on, Andy, be cool.

27:35.821 --> 27:40.406
This area is off limits,
Deputy. Military personnel
only. Senator Wen's orders.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.443
Did I miss the memo?
Oops, sorry. My bad.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.655
Good job.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.411
You want to tell me
exactly what
you're doing here?

27:46.582 --> 27:48.868
Sure. The Sheriff and
l are here on a late night
mission to steal

27:49.042 --> 27:50.953
your arc-second pulse array.
No.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.751
Right.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.878

27:55.549 --> 27:58.256
SOLDIER: That's funny.
But seriously, you can't
be here.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.712
So if you wouldn't mind.

27:59.887 --> 28:03.129
Oh, yeah. I understand.
l'll head on back
to my car then.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.755
Way to go, Andy.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.139
Okay, bye, guys.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.513
Well, Henry's taking the pulse
array to the site and Kevin

28:12.691 --> 28:13.931
is almost finished
with the assembly.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.440
They could use some more
work lights and coffee.

28:15.611 --> 28:16.726
Right. Well,
that we can provide.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.314
We're like a regular
Butch and Sundance.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.980
Yeah, only Sundance almost
blew the entire operation with
his compulsive truth-telling.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.195
Yeah, well, maybe don't
consider a life of crime.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.532
l was just about to give
you the same advice.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.821
Senator Wen,
how are you?

28:28.999 --> 28:32.583
Well, a lot better
than you two.
Where's the pulse array?

28:36.089 --> 28:39.798
Well, then you've left me
no choice. Arrest them.

28:42.471 --> 28:45.429
Yesterday l was an officer
of the law, today

28:46.808 --> 28:49.550
l'm ajail bird.
A con,
in the pokey, up the river.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.266
We did the right thing.
Kevin and Henry and are
going to find that ship.

28:54.358 --> 28:57.816
How? We've been searching
for weeks and
haven't seen a thing.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.147
Well, then we're just going
to keep searching.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.817
We're looking in space,
boss. Space.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.237
You have any idea how big
space is? It's like looking
for a needle in a haystack

29:06.411 --> 29:09.824
when the haystack
is 28 billion
light years across.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.080
What are we supposed to do?
Just give up?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.458
Go home and tell
Jenna and Kevin that
their mother is gone?

29:17.965 --> 29:22.550
Listen, boss, there has
to be a moment when
you give up hope.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.295
When you forget about
what's up there

29:26.473 --> 29:28.680
and you focus on
what's down here.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.015
Down here?

29:34.189 --> 29:37.522
I'm not sensing a tone of
sadness or despair in your
voice there, boss.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.605
Down here.
It's the one place
we haven't looked.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.900
We got to get out
of here. Andy, break open
these bars!

29:44.074 --> 29:47.237
These bars are hardened carbon
nanotubes, boss. I'm not going
to be able to break these.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.869
All right, then we do
something else.
Dig, robot, dig!

29:51.039 --> 29:52.154

Isn't this
a pretty picture?

29:54.793 --> 29:57.830
I leave you for a few weeks
and the two of you wind
up behind bars.

29:58.839 --> 30:01.455
I'm so ashamed.
You got my messages.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.796
I got your messages, yeah.
Can I give you guys a hand?

30:05.971 --> 30:07.552
Um, yeah. There's
this guard outside...

30:07.723 --> 30:12.217
Yes. He and I spoke and he's
well, taking a little bit of a
nap right now,

30:12.769 --> 30:15.101
so, shall we?

30:15.689 --> 30:16.974
Yes. After you.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.639
Let's go, guys!
It's good to see you.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.274
You too. Now what the
heck is going on?

30:21.445 --> 30:22.776
Well, where to start?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.199
All right, looking good here.
How you doing, Kev?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.075
Done.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.827
All right, here we go.
Here we go.

30:45.469 --> 30:46.925
All right, we should
pick something up.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.301
Yeah.

30:59.941 --> 31:03.900
We're too late. The particles
have already degraded.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.107
We can try adjusting
the frequency.

31:07.157 --> 31:10.445
Henry! We've been searching
the wrong haystack!

31:10.952 --> 31:12.158
Jo, you're back.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.535
Yeah. In time to break
these guys out ofjail.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.287
All this time we were thinking
about if it went up there.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.995
What happens
if the ship landed down here?

31:19.169 --> 31:22.627
It couldn't. I mean without
a boson cloud exciter to
absorb the impact,

31:22.798 --> 31:23.913
it would vaporize.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.706
Unless someone was
prepared to catch it.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.420
Someone built their
own B.C.E.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.757
Well, we were thinking
that it was sabotage.
What if it was theft?

31:31.348 --> 31:32.963
It wouldn't hurt to try.
Right?

31:33.433 --> 31:35.810
Yeah. Let's tilt it
down first.

31:39.022 --> 31:39.727
All right.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.809
HENRY: Pan it across.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.654
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.322
Oh, my God!

31:55.497 --> 31:56.737
That's it. She's down here.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.873
All right, and with the
strength of that wake,
they're not too far away

so we can triangulate
their exact location.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.759
What have you done, Sheriff?

32:14.933 --> 32:17.515
We found the Astraeus.
And potentially her crew.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.393
That's the trail.
Is this possible?

32:23.942 --> 32:27.776
So either help us or
shoot us but we're
following that trail.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.738
Sergeant, go with them!
Yes, ma'am.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.289
I'm going to call for backup.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.211
Nope. Zane, what's
the range on this thing?

32:51.386 --> 32:52.717
Maybe 30 yards.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.425
That would be a
guess considering I finished
building it an hour ago.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.766
Oh, she has faith.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.557

big and nasty?

33:03.732 --> 33:05.438
Yeah, 15 feet long.

33:05.609 --> 33:09.272
Good. Kind of hoping
it comes out
and kills the both of them.

in where it started.

at the wrong thing.

by a dragon which
is a mythical creature

you to the infirmary.

could be a logical answer
to all of this.

which could be caused
by a lot of things,

brain tumor or cocaine
addiction or temporal focal...

40:28.801 --> 40:31.508
Yeah. It seems unlikely.
Long shot.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.840
Or it could be an
infection of some kind.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.301

could cause delusions.
True.

to talk to Allison, okay?
