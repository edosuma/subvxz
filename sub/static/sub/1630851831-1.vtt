00:21.880 --> 00:27.320
Welcome to an unprecedented
seventh season of The Bachelorette,

00:27.320 --> 00:30.960
a season set to be
the most momentous ever.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.080
For the first time in 20 years
of Bachelor and Bachelorette history

00:35.080 --> 00:36.880
anywhere in the world,

00:36.880 --> 00:39.440
Australia's sweetheart,
Brooke Blurton,

00:39.440 --> 00:44.880
has become the world's first
bisexual Bachelorette.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.040
And while some things
may be different,

00:48.040 --> 00:49.520
one thing remains the same.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.520
Whether it be
with a man or with a woman,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.680
Brooke is here for one reason only -

00:55.680 --> 00:58.280
to find the love of her life.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.440
BROOKE: OK. Are we ready?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.080
Third time lucky.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.840
How's it going?
(LAUGHS) Hello.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.680
I first came into the mansion in 2018

01:15.680 --> 01:18.320
on Nick Cummins's season
of The Bachelor.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.200
I've got a pair of balls. (LAUGHS)

01:20.200 --> 01:21.520
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah. You...you do.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.680
Meeting Nick, I didn't know
that we would get along so quickly

01:25.680 --> 01:28.560
and then I'd feel such a...
a connection straightaway...

01:28.560 --> 01:30.280
Are you blushing? He's blushing.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.560
Yeah, I'm blushing.
(LAUGHS)

01:32.560 --> 01:36.160
She'd be a great wife.
Can't say that or what?

01:36.160 --> 01:39.360
BROOKE: ..and genuinely thought that
I was gonna be the girl at the end.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.400
Our connection just kept growing.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.040
But then...

01:45.200 --> 01:47.360
..everything changed.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.120
I'm so sick of feeling the same way
I've felt in my past relationships,

01:51.120 --> 01:52.680
and I don't want
to continue to feel like that.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.600
I came here to fall in love, and I...

01:57.840 --> 02:01.400
..I need a...a guy
that knows what he wants.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.800
(SIGHS)

02:05.840 --> 02:10.120
BROOKE:
He never...answered my questions.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.720
I...

02:11.720 --> 02:13.720
..gave it another shot.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.040
OMG! It's Alex Nation!

02:17.040 --> 02:18.520
BROOKE: I think she's beautiful.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.440
Inside, I was, like, "Oh!" Like,
I'm excited to...to get to know her.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.600
Yeah, you're pretty cute.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.240
I've been holding that in for ages.
(LAUGHS)

02:28.240 --> 02:29.880
BROOKE:
I had healed from the first process,

02:29.880 --> 02:33.840
hoping that there could be
some potential in paradise.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.560
But then everything changed again.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.840
I feel like my...

02:42.840 --> 02:45.440
..my feelings for Bill

02:45.440 --> 02:49.160
have kind of surpassed
what was going on with you and I.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.680
(SIGHS)

02:51.680 --> 02:56.080
She was the person that I wanted
to get to know the most here, but...

02:56.080 --> 02:59.720
..she obviously feels more connected
to someone else.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.600
When I think about that experience,
I do get a little bit sad still.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.840
I am just a girl
trying to fall in love.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.720
Whoever that's with,

03:19.720 --> 03:23.240
my motivation to find love
has always been the same.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.440
I've always looked beyond
what a person looks like.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.000
It's not about sexuality.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.320
Like, it's not about gender.
It's not about genitalia.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.120
It's always about connection...

03:34.200 --> 03:37.400
..a partner
that is on the same team as me.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.840
That's the...that's what I want.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.040
I just want to find my person.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.600
Doing it twice over and the
experience that I had in both times,

03:54.600 --> 03:58.280
I think I'm much stronger -
like, I think I've learned a lot.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.800
Family is my whole world.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.600
If you find someone that deserves
what you're putting out,

04:05.600 --> 04:10.040
then that's the person
that deserves you.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.360
BROOKE: I think my childhood

04:11.360 --> 04:13.400
was different than most.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.720
My mum and my nan passed away
when I was quite young,

04:15.720 --> 04:19.360
and I learnt to grow up
quite quickly.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.920
I had to step into

04:20.920 --> 04:23.320
that motherly role for my siblings

04:23.320 --> 04:26.480
when, really,
I was just a kid myself.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.560
Mum would definitely be
very proud of you right now.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.160
Thanks, Troy.

04:30.160 --> 04:35.040
But I think my childhood hasn't...

04:35.040 --> 04:36.800
..completely defined me.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.240
It's shaped me, but it's...

04:39.240 --> 04:42.120
..it makes...it makes me so proud
that that's where I came from

04:42.120 --> 04:43.600
and this is where I am now.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.240
Being the Bachelorette,
I get teary, I get emotional,

04:51.240 --> 04:53.480
I get goose bumps, because...

04:53.480 --> 04:55.920
..I'm the first Indigenous lead.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.520
I feel a bit of responsibility to...

04:59.520 --> 05:02.720
..not only my community
but also the queer community as well.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.520
I'm combining
both of those together, and...

05:06.520 --> 05:07.920
..it is amazing.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.640
(BLEEP) is. Sorry. (BLEEP).

05:10.640 --> 05:12.600
This is...this is cool.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.080
Like...I think me as...

05:17.240 --> 05:19.200
..a 10-year-old girl looking back

05:19.200 --> 05:23.400
and being able to watch this on TV
and feel so represented

05:23.400 --> 05:28.840
and feel like
I can see myself onscreen,

05:28.840 --> 05:33.080
the barriers that have been broken
just by doing this,

05:33.080 --> 05:34.720
I think, is huge.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.680
It's gonna be huge.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.040
OSHER: It's time
to smash some boundaries...

05:45.040 --> 05:50.880
All my life, people have tried
to put me into boxes, categories,

05:50.880 --> 05:55.000
label me,
and I think you set your own path.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.200
Nothing really defines you
unless you want it to.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.400
OSHER: ..as Brooke takes us
into uncharted waters...

06:01.400 --> 06:04.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to make history?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.320
CONTESTANTS: Yes.
Let's do it.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.640
OSHER: ..facing a mansion
full of men AND women.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.320
BROOKE:
This is how I want to fall in love.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.720
It's something
that I wouldn't compromise.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.880
And I am exactly
where I'm meant to be.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.080
Oh, she's here. Stop it.
What does she look like?

06:20.080 --> 06:25.640
It's the same Brooke, just new style,
better taste, in men AND women.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.240
MAN: Wow.
She's an absolute bombshell.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.800
She looks stunning.
Girl, you look amazing.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.520
BROOKE: Every time I come over here,
it's like a party.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.640
Bring it on!

06:34.640 --> 06:37.000
Oh!
I don't know where to look.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.800
How many abs does he have?

06:40.280 --> 06:42.000
Oh, my God!

06:42.000 --> 06:45.480
OSHER: It's the season
that redefines The Bachelorette...

06:45.480 --> 06:49.280
BROOKE: I really wanted to kiss her
in that moment.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.760
OSHER: ..and brings a whole new
set of tensions into play.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.600
BROOKE:
I knew coming into this experience

06:54.600 --> 06:56.440
that there might be a possibility
the guys and girls

06:56.440 --> 06:58.520
would have an attraction
to one another.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.040
MAN: There's one guy in here
who's deviated away from

07:02.040 --> 07:03.320
wanting to get to know Brooke.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.640
I'm not OK with this.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.760
Alarm bells. Lies.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.600
I'm hearing rumours and speculation.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.880
Honestly,
tonight was a total mind(BLEEP).

07:13.880 --> 07:15.760
I don't want to
have to do that again.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.400
OSHER:
Get ready to open your heart...

07:22.400 --> 07:25.160
To real love in all forms.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.200
BROOKE:
They know how to kiss a woman.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.600
Could just kiss you all day.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.280
BROOKE: I do absolutely believe
that I could find he or she.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.280
I just want
someone to share my life with.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.160
WOMAN: I am actually so smitten.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.440
My heart's racing.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.480
BROOKE: I have never
been romanced like this before.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.040
MAN: It feels like
something out of a fairytale.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.760
BROOKE: I'm in love with you.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.960
OSHER: ..as Brooke
finds her one true person.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.000
BROOKE: I did this experience
the first time. It didn't work.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.600
I tried the second. It didn't work.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.760
And the third time has restored...

08:01.760 --> 08:04.720
..like, my faith
in, like, actually...

08:07.600 --> 08:12.440
..loving something so unconditionally
and knowing they love you back.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.240
I'm really and utterly in love.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.800
I'm so madly in love.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.520
(STICKS CLAP)
(DIDGERIDOO PLAYS)

09:07.760 --> 09:11.560
Hello, Osh. (LAUGHS)

09:14.560 --> 09:15.880
MAN: Worimi. Hello.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.400
Welcome, brothers and sisters,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.320
I would like
to welcome you all here this evening

09:22.320 --> 09:26.440
to pay our respects to the country
that we stand upon today,

09:26.440 --> 09:30.080
Dharug country,
and of the Bidjigal clan.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.200
I especially and humbly
pay my respects

09:33.200 --> 09:38.320
to the elders of this great nation,
both past and present.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:40.720 --> 09:43.160
while you're here in Dharug country,

09:43.160 --> 09:47.600
may the good spirit Baiame
watch over you from the high country

09:47.600 --> 09:50.760
and take you safely on your journey.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.440
(SPEAKS INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE)

09:52.440 --> 09:53.920
Walk in good spirits.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.400
I'll leave you in peace and harmony.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.440
Yanu.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.960
(LAUGHS)

10:01.960 --> 10:03.640
It's just like
a little piece of home.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
Thank you so much, guys.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.920
Can I hug? (LAUGHS)
You can do whatever you want.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.400
Thank you so much.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.400
Thank you.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.320
BROOKE: This is a perfect moment
and I get tears.

10:17.320 --> 10:22.640
It wasn't, like, sad tears.
It was, like, a happy cry.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.480
How does it feel to be here?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.040
(SIGHS)

10:26.040 --> 10:29.320
I think after that welcome,
obviously, um,

10:29.320 --> 10:32.960
all of the emotion at the moment,
it's a lot to process.

10:32.960 --> 10:38.040
What would it have meant to you
to turn on the TV as a teenager

10:38.040 --> 10:42.280
and see someone who was like you
doing this?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.200
Yeah, I...I can't honestly
put it into words, Osh.

10:45.200 --> 10:49.680
I'm so excited for all those
little 10-year-old Brookes that

10:49.680 --> 10:52.600
feel represented and feel proud
to just be who they are

10:52.600 --> 10:55.520
with no judgement and...and free.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.400
'Cause you can't be
what you can't see.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.360
And right now, Brooke,
you are showing

11:00.360 --> 11:02.880
a generation of people
what they can be.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.040
That is a huge reason
why I'm glad you're here,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.280
but I also really want you
to fall in love.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.640
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:09.640 --> 11:12.200
Well, I'm hoping third time lucky
that there could be someone,

11:12.200 --> 11:14.640
and I'm going with this
with an open mind and an open heart,

11:14.640 --> 11:16.480
as always, and...

11:16.480 --> 11:19.680
..being love is just certainty,

11:19.680 --> 11:22.120
it's comfortable,
it's that unconditional love,

11:22.120 --> 11:25.360
which is something
that I'm not very familiar with,

11:25.360 --> 11:28.440
and, like, I've had my walls up
for a very long time,

11:28.440 --> 11:31.000
especially through
the experiences I've been through

11:31.000 --> 11:32.920
doing this twice over,

11:32.920 --> 11:35.200
but I'm trying really hard that...

11:35.200 --> 11:36.560
..all walls are down
in this experience.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.240
I am open to it
and I'm ready for it.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.600
Brooke, your love story
is about to begin.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.040
Have a fantastic night, darling.
Thank you.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.680
Enjoy.
Oh, my God.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.160
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.640
Just breathe. Like, just
breathe through it. You can do this.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.040
This is the moment.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.480
(SIGHS)

12:07.480 --> 12:09.880
OK. (CLEARS THROAT)

12:14.800 --> 12:18.040
I'm Holly. I'm 27. I'm from Sydney.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.920
I am a marketing administrator,
and then I am also a dancer.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.440
I'd watched Brooke
on her season of The Bachelor

12:26.440 --> 12:30.520
and thought
that she is beautiful on the outside,

12:30.520 --> 12:35.320
she's beautiful on the inside,
and from what I've seen of her,

12:35.320 --> 12:37.880
we'd get on really, really well
and had heaps of things in common.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.280
So, I'm here to get to know Brooke,

12:40.280 --> 12:44.400
because this could 100% be the start
of something wonderful.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.760
Oh, my God. (LAUGHS)

12:51.760 --> 12:54.320
Hello.
Hi!

12:54.320 --> 12:56.240
How are you?
That dress, you.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.920
(LAUGHS)
You look incredible.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.360
Hello, beautiful. How are you?
Is it OK if I have...?

13:00.360 --> 13:03.240
Yeah, of course. What's your name?
I'm Holly.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.360
Holly. Come around. (LAUGHS)
It's so nice to meet you.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.400
Wow.
You look incredible.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.560
No, so do you!

13:08.560 --> 13:09.920
How are you feeling?
Good.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.920
How are YOU feeling? Nervous?
Nervous.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.680
Yeah?
Yeah. Just great to be here.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.720
Oh.
Yeah.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.080
That's so good.
Tell me about yourself.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.320
I am 27.
Yeah.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.760
I'm a dancer. Do you dance?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.000
Are you a dance floor gal?
(LAUGHS) Um...

13:24.000 --> 13:25.720
Can you dance?
I dance, but I'm not very good.

13:25.720 --> 13:30.880
Well, when I am feeling
nervous or overwhelmed,

13:30.880 --> 13:34.280
something that I do
is I slow-dance...

13:34.280 --> 13:37.480
OK.
..and it just calms me down.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.040
It brings me back to the moment
and it just...

13:40.040 --> 13:42.080
Beautiful.
..lets me take a breath.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.680
So I was hoping,
if it's OK with you...

13:43.680 --> 13:45.360
Yes?
..we could have a little dance.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.360
Is that OK with you?
Yes. Of course. Where would...

13:47.360 --> 13:48.640
Yes?
So I'm gonna hold you there.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.640
Ooh!

13:49.640 --> 13:51.640
Aw!
I know.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.240
This is beautiful.
And then we're just gonna...

13:53.240 --> 13:55.480
And just keep turning.
And just keep turning.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.080
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.400
Yeah. This is extremely romantic.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.920
It's good.
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:02.920 --> 14:04.600
I just can't get over this number.
It's beautiful.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.800
I just think...
Thank you.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.320
..you are gorgeous.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.480
So are you.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.960
(LAUGHS)
Took the words right out of my mouth.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.520
BROOKE: Slow-dancing with Holly
was just so romantic.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.560
I just felt comfortable
with doing that with her, instantly,

14:18.560 --> 14:21.680
and I don't really get that
with a lot of people.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.880
I loved it.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.360
'Cause I think that's so nice.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.680
It's comforting. Yeah.
It is. You're actually really warm.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.800
BROOKE: Holly has fully wooed me.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.600
Ooh!

14:34.600 --> 14:36.920
That was...oh. And the kick back.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.760
BROOKE:
Just the way that she makes me feel.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.040
I am, like, mind blown.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.360
You're really good at that,
by the way.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.200
Thank you.
I've never slow-danced with someone.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.040
That was really beautiful.
First time for everything tonight.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.160
So, what brings...like...
you're in the mansion.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.600
Yes.
(LAUGHS) You're here.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.080
What...what actually
brings you here?

14:53.080 --> 14:57.240
I am so happy
with everything in my life.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.800
I'm ready to share that with someone.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.760
And I'm hoping
that someone might be you.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.160
Oh.
Yeah.
I love that.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.520
Yep.
Thank you. I'm excited for that.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.880
Oh.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.560
HOLLY: Oh, she's incredible.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.280
Ooh!

15:11.280 --> 15:13.600
She's so pretty.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.240
Alright.
I should let you get inside.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.240
Well, thank you for the dance.
Don't dance with anyone else.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.680
(LAUGHS)
I won't. I promise.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.600
Brooke is a great dancer.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.960
I don't know
what she's worried about.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.840
Yeah. It was...
it was a wonderful dance.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.080
Oh, no. How romantic.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.680
Oh, I just can't stop smiling.
How romantic.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.080
We're...let's just pack it up.
We're done. (LAUGHS)

15:36.080 --> 15:38.520
I absolutely loved that.
That was so gorgeous.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.080
(ENGINE STARTS)

15:58.800 --> 16:00.920
Motorbike?

16:04.120 --> 16:06.000
(LAUGHS)

16:20.440 --> 16:22.240
Hey.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.120
(LAUGHS) That's one way to rock up.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.800
How you doing?
Good. How are YOU?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.840
Yeah, well, thanks.
Oh, my God.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.800
Look at this shiny number.
I know. I've gone all-out.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.280
Lovely to meet you. Mwah!
What's your...

16:33.280 --> 16:34.520
Mwah!
..what's your name?

16:34.520 --> 16:35.640
Darvid.
Darvid.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.080
BROOKE:
First of all, Darvid is handsome,

16:37.080 --> 16:41.320
who I did not expect
to just rock up on a lawnmower.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.040
That is one impressive ride there.
(LAUGHS) Like...

16:45.040 --> 16:47.280
It's got a backstory to it. (LAUGHS)
OK.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.640
So I've got a landscaping business
back in Brissie,

16:49.640 --> 16:51.000
so hence the...hence the mower.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.480
Oh! Beautiful.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.720
I've got a couple of other things
there I'll go and grab and show you.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.960
So just...you stay there.
Yeah. OK.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.080
Hang five.
I'll stay put.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.560
Close your eyes.
Alright.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.560
BROOKE:
And now he's made me close my eyes

17:02.560 --> 17:04.760
so he can prepare something.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.600
Like, what do I expect next?

17:08.600 --> 17:10.080
So...as you heard,

17:10.080 --> 17:12.120
my name is Darvid, which is Persian.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.960
So I thought...
Are you a Persian prince?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.280
I could be.
(LAUGHS)

17:15.280 --> 17:17.320
If you want me to be. (LAUGHS)

17:17.320 --> 17:20.360
I thought in amongst the madness...
(SIGHS)

17:20.360 --> 17:22.720
..we can sit down
and have a cup of tea.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.000
Oh! I would love a tea right now.
(LAUGHS) Maybe warm you up.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.880
Please!
This is my Persian little set-up.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.880
It's...it's quite important to me
to embrace my heritage, obviously.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.800
It's something
that I haven't always embraced,

17:34.800 --> 17:36.280
I think, in younger years.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.560
As I get a bit older, it...
it sort of means a bit more to me.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.880
Yeah, yeah.
I just love my Aboriginal culture.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.640
Like, it's just such a grounding...

17:43.640 --> 17:45.440
Yeah, it's a...
..process, when you learn more.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.600
Yeah. It's nice to sort of
delve a bit deeper in it.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.760
Yeah. Yeah.
I think this is really special.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.840
Culture for me is everything,

17:53.840 --> 17:55.880
because, obviously,
I really take pride

17:55.880 --> 17:58.200
in my own Indigenous background.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.760
Cheers.
Cheers.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.360
Mmm.
Oh!

18:03.360 --> 18:06.600
BROOKE: So seeing Darvid
very passionate about his culture

18:06.600 --> 18:09.080
is...oh, it's just so beautiful.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.840
I've got one last thing for you,
as corny as it is.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.320
This is...

18:15.320 --> 18:17.400
Can you guess?
Uh, yeah.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.000
It's a genie lamp. Yeah.
It's a l... Yes.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.680
Yes. I'm...I'm big on wishes.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.640
OK. (LAUGHS)
Yes.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.720
So, I thought, fitting the Persian
theme, I'd give you three wishes.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.960
OK.
(LAUGHS)

18:27.960 --> 18:30.040
I know you already used
the first one on me appearing.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.640
Yes. Exactly.
Your Persian prince appearing.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.320
So you've got...
How did you know?

18:33.320 --> 18:36.160
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) So, you've got two more.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.320
Of course, I'm hoping a couple
of those wishes are me at the end.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.800
Thank you so much, Darvid.
It was a pleasure.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.080
I actually really enjoyed...
Me too.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.080
Yeah.
Oh!

18:44.080 --> 18:46.000
DARVID: Maybe a first single date.
We'll start with that.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.120
I won't sell myself to the end
just yet, but...

18:49.120 --> 18:51.400
..we're on the right track
at least - we're on the right track.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.200
(LAUGHS)
Wow.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.920
(SIGHS)

18:54.920 --> 18:56.280
That was so cute.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.360
Oh, my God.
I thought that was just so sweet.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.960
Bring out my Persian prince again.
(LAUGHS)

19:01.960 --> 19:04.440
I was, like,
"Do you just want to go get, like,

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
"hitched now on the lawnmower?"

19:06.440 --> 19:08.440
Just... (LAUGHS)

19:08.440 --> 19:10.360
"Just ma..."

19:10.360 --> 19:12.920
Could you imagine? And the cans,
like, rattling on the back.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.880
Like...ticka, ticka, tick. (LAUGHS)

19:15.880 --> 19:18.400
I always get all way ahead of myself.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.040
(LAUGHS)
I'm, like, "Whoa! Calm down!"

19:23.360 --> 19:25.640
(SIGHS)

19:26.640 --> 19:27.920
(MAN SIGHS)

19:27.920 --> 19:31.240
My name is Beau. I'm 34.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.400
I am a photographer
and I'm from Sydney.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.960
I like to look good.
I like to dress good.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.280
Everyone used to say
I was a pretty boy.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.040
It's just naturally been
a thing for me.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.040
My name is spelt B-E-A-U,
because in French,

19:43.040 --> 19:44.800
even though we're not French,
it means 'beautiful',

19:44.800 --> 19:48.680
so B-E-A-U-tiful. (LAUGHS)

19:51.800 --> 19:53.760
Hello.
Hello.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.520
Brooke. Brookie.
Yes.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.960
Or what I would
like to call you, BB.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.360
(LAUGHS)
How are you?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.680
I'm good. How are you?
Good, thank you. Good, thank you.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.880
Whoof! You look beautiful.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.040
Cute AF.
You look handsome as well.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.520
Thank you very much. I think I do.
I know I do, actually.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.400
(LAUGHS) Confident.
Yes, so, my name is Beau.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.000
I'm a photographer, carpenter...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.200
Oh, wow.
..and builder.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.720
Some would say
I'm a jack-of-all-trades.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.720
Beautiful.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.720
Others would say
I'm great with my hands.
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:21.720 --> 20:23.640
She's definitely attractive,
that's for sure.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.840
I love girls that are just cute AF.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.440
First up, I want to do
a little impromptu photoshoot.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.640
Are you down?
OK.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.000
(LAUGHS)
Alright. Ready?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.520
Three, two, one.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.160
(LAUGHS) This is so sweet.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.120
Oof! Lovely photo.
(LAUGHS)

20:41.120 --> 20:43.120
Lovely photo.
BROOKE: He's come with a job.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.040
It's, like, "I'm here.
I'm here to do business."

20:46.040 --> 20:47.200
Just free up.
OK.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.760
Little bit more energy.
Feel yourself, girl.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.920
Alright. I'm gonna feel myself.
Alright.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.520
(LAUGHS) Literally.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.280
(LAUGHS)
What about, like, a little, like...

20:54.280 --> 20:57.080
Oh, I love that.
Ooh! Now I'm getting lower.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.960
Damn!
(LAUGHS)

20:58.960 --> 21:01.760
Alright. Ready? One, two, three.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.000
Oh, my God.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.240
That's the money shot, girl.
(LAUGHS)

21:05.240 --> 21:06.920
Damn!

21:06.920 --> 21:09.280
Lovely. I have my own
personal stash of photos already.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.080
Oh! No.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.320
That's...we don't want
to go down that line. Gross.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.160
Eugh! (LAUGHS)

21:17.160 --> 21:19.240
I hope those photos are good.
Oh, they're good.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.080
As I said, they're for
my personal collection now.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.160
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

21:22.160 --> 21:24.200
BEAU: Brooke is picking up
what I put down.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.480
She's seen the confidence.
I felt like she absolutely loved it.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.440
Bye, Beau.
See ya.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.120
BEAU: She loves me already.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.200
I feel good. I feel good.
I look good. Look at me.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.200
Love it. (LAUGHS)

21:43.880 --> 21:45.000
(LAUGHS)

21:45.000 --> 21:46.480
(BLEEP)!

21:55.600 --> 21:59.400
My name is Carissa.
I'm 30 years old.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.920
And I'm a psychologist
on the Gold Coast.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.760
Hi.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.200
Hello.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.600
How are you?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.560
Good.
It's nice to finally meet you.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.760
Wow.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.040
You look so beautiful. Oh, my God.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.040
Oh, thank you.
What was your name?

22:22.040 --> 22:23.480
Carissa.
Carissa.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.360
So, I'm an artist.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.080
But I painted you a picture.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.320
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

22:29.320 --> 22:30.880
Thank you so much.
That's OK.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.800
So I actually have a little story
I wanted to share with you

22:32.800 --> 22:35.200
about what's
kind of led me to be here.

22:35.200 --> 22:40.960
So, a few years ago, I lost both
my parents. They both passed away.

22:41.960 --> 22:46.480
And...after my mum's funeral,
there was this beautiful rainbow

22:46.480 --> 22:49.160
that just appeared instantly
as we walked out.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.200
And...

22:50.200 --> 22:53.000
..after that,
it got to the stage where

22:53.000 --> 22:56.680
I would just keep seeing rainbows
whenever I thought about her.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.200
And recently, I just started
seeing all these rainbows again.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.640
I just felt like she was around me
and I didn't know why.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.920
And then I saw your photo
for the first time.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.080
Obviously, you're so beautiful,
and who as a person, and...

23:09.080 --> 23:11.880
..I just felt so drawn to you.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.960
(LAUGHS) OK.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.400
Wow. (LAUGHS)

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
Oh.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.480
Um...

23:16.480 --> 23:19.680
..it's crazy that you're saying that,
'cause on the way here, like,

23:19.680 --> 23:21.800
I saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky,

23:21.800 --> 23:23.760
and I was, like, "It's a sign."

23:23.760 --> 23:26.440
So I'm trying not to...
to get so emotional right now...
Yeah.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.920
..but I...I really appreciate
you sharing the story with me.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.040
BROOKE: I'm definitely
a bit of a spiritual person,

23:32.040 --> 23:35.520
so when she spoke that a rainbow
is definitely a sign for her as well,

23:35.520 --> 23:37.080
I was trying to hold back tears.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.280
So...you can open it now,

23:39.280 --> 23:42.520
and I'm going to explain
why I painted it.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.520
'Cause I'm an artist,
as I said, but...

23:44.520 --> 23:47.680
..I did it on a turtle
because I love the ocean.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.960
Oh, my God. I love this so much.
And that's a rainbow.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.120
And I want the rainbow to represent

23:53.120 --> 23:57.400
not only our queer community
but also that universe magic,

23:57.400 --> 24:00.240
the magic that...
the rainbows kind of led me here.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.520
I'm actually speechless.
I don't even know what to say.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.760
'Cause I think...my totem
is a turtle. I love the ocean.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.840
I know.
You're kidding.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.920
No.
I did not know that.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.400
No. It means a lot to me.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.560
You have no idea
how much this just means.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.920
So much synchronicity, hey?
Yeah.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.760
Can I just...thank you so much.
(LAUGHS)

24:16.840 --> 24:19.400
Oh, wow. I was lost for words.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.920
She's so beautiful and...

24:22.920 --> 24:25.400
..straightaway,
I felt we're just so in sync.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.240
Oh, God. OK. Enjoy.
I'll see you soon.

24:28.240 --> 24:33.040
CARISSA: It's hard not to feel like
maybe Brooke could be my person.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.080
Oh, I couldn't have expected it
to go any better.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.920
Oh, my God, I love this so much.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.080
Oh! That gave me goose bumps then.
(LAUGHS)

24:42.080 --> 24:43.680
I definitely have a good feeling
about Carissa.

24:43.680 --> 24:47.760
So I'm in real trouble, if...
(LAUGHS)

24:47.760 --> 24:50.040
Phew! Like...

24:50.040 --> 24:51.680
Yeah.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.040
My name's Konrad. I'm 31.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.680
I'm from Melbourne.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.400
And I'm a carpenter.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.800
Here we go.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.840
I think people judge me
by appearance a lot of the time,

25:10.840 --> 25:12.560
thinking I'm gonna be sort of

25:12.560 --> 25:16.760
typical...maybe athletic,
staunch kind of guy in a sense,

25:16.760 --> 25:20.720
but I'm really kind of sensitive
and definitely a hopeless romantic.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.960
I love love.
I love every aspect of it.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.200
(SIGHS)

25:27.720 --> 25:29.520
(LAUGHS)

25:31.440 --> 25:34.880
It's kind of like a lucky dip.
You don't know who's gonna come out.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.640
(SIGHS)

25:42.800 --> 25:44.160
Hello.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.320
Hey. How you going?
Good.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.400
You look bright. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

25:48.400 --> 25:50.320
You look beautiful. Look at you.
Oh, thank you.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.400
I'll just leave this here.
Hopefully, it doesn't fall out.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.400
Hello.
Hello. I'm Brooke.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.040
Nice to meet you.
Konrad. Nice to meet you.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.160
Konrad.

25:57.160 --> 26:00.280
So, if this hasn't given it away
already, I'm a carpenter.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.440
Yeah.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.400
So, I've put together
a little project for us.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.720
I thought we could have a go

26:04.720 --> 26:06.480
at maybe building something
we...we could share,

26:06.480 --> 26:07.880
we could use together...

26:07.880 --> 26:08.880
Love that.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.920
..and...and maybe create some of
our own memories we could cherish.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.240
Yep.
Yeah? So...

26:14.240 --> 26:15.240
I'm down.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.320
Would you be able to help me
grab some materials?

26:17.320 --> 26:20.160
I can absolutely carry some stuff.
Is that alright? Yeah?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.520
First impression - wow.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.680
A man with his hands.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.800
Carrying wood. He's strong.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.240
Getting me on the job already.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.240
I like it. I really like this.
Yeah? I love this confidence.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.720
BROOKE: The tradie look just...

26:33.720 --> 26:35.200
..gets me.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.320
Should I get on the tools too?

26:36.320 --> 26:38.120
Yeah? Alright, come...
Yeah. I want to give it a crack.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.600
Yeah, absolutely.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.960
Brooke looks absolutely amazing.
She's gorgeous. (LAUGHS)

26:42.960 --> 26:45.560
And she just wants
to jump on the tools straightaway.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.000
Like, ha!

26:47.000 --> 26:49.160
(WHIRRING)

26:54.360 --> 26:55.920
Perfect. How good?

26:55.920 --> 26:58.800
She put that furniture together
better than I could have.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.680
Thank you so much. Well done.
Good job. Well done.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.280
You know what that is?
That's...chef's kiss.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.600
Chef's kiss. (LAUGHS)
Yes. Beautiful.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.000
Can we test it?
Now?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.960
You know, yeah, just...
I know you really want to sit on it.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.960
But...
What?

27:09.960 --> 27:12.080
Are you trying to run away from me?
How about we make a deal?

27:12.080 --> 27:16.560
I'll find a...a magical,
beautiful, picturesque spot

27:16.560 --> 27:18.760
somewhere
in the back of the mansion,

27:18.760 --> 27:21.200
I'll get changed into something
a little bit more appropriate,

27:21.200 --> 27:23.160
and during the cocktail party,
maybe we could...

27:23.160 --> 27:24.240
I...
..and we could sit down.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.800
That is absolutely happening.
Yes?

27:26.800 --> 27:30.120
I am, like,
dying to sit on this seat for a chat.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.280
That's your pinky promise?
Yep.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.000
OK.
Deal?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Perfect.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.480
But he wants to...to wait
to get to the cocktail party.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.720
Thank you, Brooke. I'll see you...
(LAUGHS) ..I'll see you soon.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.560
Don't smash anything, please.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.400
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

27:44.400 --> 27:48.080
BROOKE: So I feel like
he's kind of left me wanting more.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.040
Bye, Konrad!

27:50.040 --> 27:54.880
And, yeah, bit of mystery to him,
which I think is really sexy.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.920
He was hot. He was really hot.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.280
Just want to get to know him more.
Like, he left me curious.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.720
I love...I just love that.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.040
It's almost time.
It's almost go time.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.280
(LAUGHS)
I'm ready.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.360
Are you ready?
Yes. (LAUGHS)

28:08.360 --> 28:10.960
(SIGHS)
I am actually shitting myself.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.280
I feel like I need to vomit.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.920
You'll be right. You want to do
another relaxation breath?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.000
Yes. One more.
Ready?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.280
(BOTH INHALE)

28:18.280 --> 28:20.880

28:36.560 --> 28:38.080
Hello.
How you doing?

28:38.080 --> 28:39.760
Good. How are you going?
Good.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.520
What a night
to find the love of your life.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.960
(LAUGHS) Exactly.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.040
I'm Ryan.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.040
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. I'm Brooke.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.800
RYAN: I'm definitely here
to meet the right girl,

28:48.800 --> 28:50.680
and Brooke
is just what I'm looking for.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.160
Um... (LAUGHS)

28:53.160 --> 28:55.080
My name is Ritu.
Nice to meet you.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.360
As soon as I saw her
and we connected eyes

28:58.360 --> 29:00.280
and we held hands,
I seriously felt really relaxed.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.040
I feel so safe
now that we're holding hands.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.360
That's a big green flag for me.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.960
I just want to say, um...

29:05.960 --> 29:09.080

Wow.
Um...I'm a First Nation woman.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.080
And I live in Narromine,
New South Wales.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.280
She's smoking-hot - like...

29:19.280 --> 29:21.440
..I couldn't even stare at her.
(LAUGHS)

29:21.440 --> 29:24.000
I study, so I do a bachelor
of community and social development

29:24.000 --> 29:25.720
for Indigenous communities.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.360
Wow. Beautiful.
And I'm just, like...oh, my God.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.480
You're stunning, and
I can't even stare at you. (LAUGHS)

29:30.480 --> 29:32.880
It's fine. Do you want to take
a couple of breaths, like...

29:32.880 --> 29:35.080
Yeah, she's so my type.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.160
I'm Kurt.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.800
OK.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.440
Yeah, cool.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.280
For that reason, I thought
I'd get you a pair of, uh, togs,

29:45.280 --> 29:47.560
and, uh,
they've got your name on the back.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.480
(LAUGHS)

29:49.480 --> 29:51.360
Just nervous energy.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.200
Yep.
Just lapsing.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.720
It's fine. We...we got this.

29:56.800 --> 29:57.840
Well...

29:57.840 --> 29:58.920
..I do.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.640
Do... Oh.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.440

Well done.

I'm Matthew, by the way.

I didn't even think I could rap.
I don't even think still I can rap.

That was just ridiculous. (LAUGHS)

JESS: Standing in that moment then,
it just felt like

30:43.880 --> 30:46.760
I was in the right place,
just was magical.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.840
I'm Emily. Nice to meet you.

Oh, my God, Elvis.

Little baby Elvis.
You are so cute.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.040
And you look gorgeous!

30:55.040 --> 30:58.120
So do you. Wow.
Talk about this dress.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.960
We got puff vibes going on.

I am so interested in her.

I feel great and good about it.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.520
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Yes. You too.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.080
You look amazing.
You look gorgeous as well.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.720
You look handsome. (LAUGHS)
You look even better in person
somehow.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.480
Brooke is stunning -
I couldn't belie...like...

31:41.480 --> 31:42.680
..she's even better in person.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.600
I didn't think
that was possible, but wow.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.520
She's an absolute bombshell.
She's such a sweetheart as well.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.400
(SIGHS AND RUBS HANDS)

31:50.400 --> 31:51.880
Smack bang on the money, guys.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.760
Good crop. Good picks.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.600
(SIGHS)

32:01.600 --> 32:03.160
My name's Jamie-Lee.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.960
I'm 30. I live in Sydney.
And I'm a psychology student.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.680
I was on the Honey Badger season
of The Bachelor.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.880
I came in as an intruder.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.840
Hello.
Hi. I'm Jamie-Lee.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.160
Jamie-Lee? I'm Nick.
Nick. Nice to meet you.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.560
So I do know Brooke.

32:21.880 --> 32:25.320
Brooke and I spent a lot of time
together in the house.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.760
We had so much in common.
We just clicked.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.960
But I definitely think
it was more than just friends.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.400
I honestly think
that there was something there.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.000
I was really mindful that Brooke

32:35.000 --> 32:36.920
had a really strong connection
with Nick,

32:36.920 --> 32:39.920
and I never wanted
to overstep that friendship barrier,

32:39.920 --> 32:43.720
so I never really voiced my mind

32:43.720 --> 32:48.040
and...and spoke about
there maybe being feelings involved.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.440
And when I left the mansion,
we kind of lost touch,

32:50.440 --> 32:52.880
so Brooke and I
never got the chance to see

32:52.880 --> 32:55.000
if there was
actually something between us.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.920
I feel like now I have
a second chance with Brooke.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.040
I have a chance to actually
get my feelings off my chest

33:04.040 --> 33:06.480
and see if there's something more.

33:06.480 --> 33:12.520
She has no idea that I'm here
or what I have to say.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.200
(LAUGHS)

33:15.680 --> 33:19.120
When I left the mansion,
I wrote a little letter for Brooke.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.280
To this day,
I've kept a copy of this letter,

33:21.280 --> 33:25.040
and tonight's the night I get
to share those words with her again.

33:35.720 --> 33:38.000
I feel like
I'm really putting myself out there,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.800
I'm putting
my feelings out there, and...

33:39.800 --> 33:41.920
..I just don't know
how she's going to react.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.960
Maybe she just sees me as a friend.
I really don't know.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.520
I guess this is the moment
that's gonna tell.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.000
(GASPS)

33:59.000 --> 34:01.600
(LAUGHS)
Hey, babe.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.360
(GASPS)

34:23.360 --> 34:25.200
(LAUGHS)

34:25.200 --> 34:26.520
Hey, babe.

34:27.640 --> 34:31.240
Oh, my God! (LAUGHS)
You look amazing!

34:31.240 --> 34:33.640
Oh, my God!

34:33.640 --> 34:35.120
Hi.
Jamie!

34:35.120 --> 34:36.200
How are you?

34:36.200 --> 34:39.160
You look incredible.
Oh, my God.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.680
(BOTH LAUGH)

34:45.440 --> 34:47.080
Oh, my God.
(LAUGHS)

34:47.080 --> 34:48.200
Pinch me.

34:48.200 --> 34:53.120
I did not expect you
to come around that corner.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.600
Yeah.
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

34:56.600 --> 34:58.480
I have something to read for you.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.760
And I hope that you remember this.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.560
"I'm so grateful that I've had you
through this experience.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.160
"You're one of a kind
and you deserve to take this out.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.360
"Please remember your worth

35:10.360 --> 35:12.160
"through everything you've got
coming your way.

35:12.160 --> 35:16.000
"This is gonna test you, but
if anyone can handle it, it's you.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.320
"Remember,
things happen for a reason,

35:17.320 --> 35:20.520
"to have faith in yourself
and the universe's plan for you.

35:20.520 --> 35:24.720
"Thank you for being you,
letting me in and always being real.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.960
"Everything will turn out
exactly as it should. I promise."

35:27.960 --> 35:29.680
(LAUGHS)

35:29.680 --> 35:32.200
Oh!
(BOTH LAUGH)

35:32.200 --> 35:35.880
I remember you giving me that and
writing that to me. I still have it.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.280
(LAUGHS)
I still have it.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.640
When you left...

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
..I was...

35:40.640 --> 35:41.880
..like, so sad.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.600
And then...

35:43.600 --> 35:46.240
..I thought about you all the time.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.760
BROOKE: I've cared for Jamie-Lee
for a long time.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.360
There was something there
from the start between us both,

35:51.360 --> 35:52.920
but we've just been in relationships

35:52.920 --> 35:55.400
and we've just never been able
to, like, express that.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.960
Just want you to know that, like,

35:56.960 --> 35:58.560
I don't want to go out there
and date just anyone.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.040
I want to date you, Brooke.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.960
Oh!
For real.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.240
Yep.
Like...that's...that's why I'm here.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.320
And I honestly believe that
everything that we've been through

36:06.320 --> 36:08.000
has led us to right now.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.280
Oh, my God.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.400
I'm so glad that you said that and...
(LAUGHS)

36:11.400 --> 36:13.720
..so grateful that you were here,
like, from the bottom of my heart,

36:13.720 --> 36:17.680
'cause we didn't have our chance
to actually explore this.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.520
This is a new journey for you and I.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.760
Let's do it together. We got this.
Alright.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.440
BROOKE: Just seeing her,
a lot of feelings came flooding back.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.560
Me too.

36:29.560 --> 36:34.040
So, I absolutely think it could be a
beautiful love story with Jamie-Lee.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.160
I'm hoping
that this could be our time.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.160
(LAUGHS)

36:37.160 --> 36:39.800
And I genuinely believe
that everything will turn out

36:39.800 --> 36:41.280
exactly as it should.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.560
JAMIE-LEE:
I just put it all out there.

36:43.560 --> 36:47.040
I think that some of that
was reciprocated.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.160
Thank God.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.520
Come find me later, OK?
I will. Be good.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.920
I know you.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.120
JAMIE-LEE: So, I don't know
if I'm getting ahead of myself,

36:56.120 --> 36:59.200
but I feel like
there is a chance there.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.800
I feel confident
that this could be it. (LAUGHS)

37:02.800 --> 37:05.680
Feels so right.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.120
Did not expect that. (LAUGHS)

37:10.120 --> 37:12.400
I'll just... Whoo!

37:18.880 --> 37:21.520
(GLASSES CLINK)
Cheers. Cheers! Cheers!

37:21.520 --> 37:25.520
Congrats, everyone, for getting this
far and being a part of this and...

37:25.520 --> 37:28.160
This far.
To the next step, hopefully.
Yeah. Hopefully.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.920
TAJE:
Going into the first cocktail party,

37:29.920 --> 37:34.080
it's just so crazy
that there's both male and females

37:34.080 --> 37:35.760
in the same space,

37:35.760 --> 37:38.760
you know, being here for one woman.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.160
Heck, yeah. Here for it, baby.
Yep.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.480
Um, um, um, um!
Yeah.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.280
Absolute vibes.
This is gonna be great.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.920
It is so awesome to see that.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.400
Everybody tell us
what you did on the red carpet.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.720
I decided to get her
a pair of swimmers.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.240
I'm wearing a matching pair.
Do you want to see 'em?

37:54.240 --> 37:55.520
OTHERS: Yes!

37:55.520 --> 37:57.960
(LAUGHTER)
You're the man!

37:57.960 --> 38:00.120
You're the man!
(APPLAUSE)

38:00.120 --> 38:01.760
There's a lot of people
in the party now.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.440
The atmosphere is pumping.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.760
How does my butt look?
OTHERS: Yeah.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.400
It needs a bit of work, eh?
It needs a bit of work.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.160
We're mingling with everyone.
We're sussing everyone out.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.800
There was apparently a man here
who was building a chair.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.480
Oh!
(LAUGHS)

38:14.480 --> 38:17.680
The man's right here.
That's y... (LAUGHS)

38:17.680 --> 38:18.960
That's him.

38:18.960 --> 38:23.640
But I just wanted to show who I am
and show my confidence, I guess.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.400
I did a photoshoot with her.
I owned that shit, man.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.200
You owned it? Oh, no...
Oh, (BLEEP) ate it up.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.320
BEAU: Because I know
I'm a big threat, that's for sure.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.160
(LAUGHS)

38:36.640 --> 38:38.600
Oh, shit.

38:38.600 --> 38:43.440
I have to ask, like, how do you guys
feel that it's both, like, male...

38:43.440 --> 38:45.080
I love it.
..and female?

38:45.080 --> 38:48.080
Bring it on! I love it. It's fun.
(LAUGHS)

38:48.080 --> 38:50.840
BEAU: I mean, to be honest, I'm not
worried about this situation now,

38:50.840 --> 38:53.920
which is guys and girls
vying for Brooke's attention.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.520
I don't think much scares me,
to be honest.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.160
Yeah, OK.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.400
There's nothing wrong
with a bit of healthy competition.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.120
Do you feel a little bit,
like, intimidated

39:02.120 --> 39:03.520
there's guys as well or...?

39:03.520 --> 39:05.560
Like, if I'm being
completely honest with you...

39:05.560 --> 39:06.560
Yeah.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.680
..I think women are so much
more intimidating than men.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.160
When I first kind of felt that
there was gonna be women in here,

39:11.160 --> 39:12.600
I was, like, "I'm screwed."

39:12.600 --> 39:14.080
(LAUGHS)
"I'm literally screwed."

39:14.080 --> 39:17.160
I was, like...
I just feel like women know women.

39:17.160 --> 39:20.680
100%. There's
some stiff competition here, eh?

39:25.560 --> 39:30.160
Coming into this mansion, I don't
know if anyone will recognise me.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.160
I don't know if anyone knows
that I have a history with Brooke.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.480
MAN: Who have we got?

39:34.480 --> 39:37.360
(GASPING AND SCREAMING)

39:37.360 --> 39:41.200
But I'm nervous. I'm nervous
for this part now. (LAUGHS)

39:41.200 --> 39:43.720
Another one.
Oh, wow.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.040
MAN: Ooh!

39:46.040 --> 39:48.280
Who's that?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.760
She looks familiar.
Hey, guys.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.920
(OTHERS CALL GREETINGS)
Hi.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.080
Hello.
I'm Jamie-Lee.
I'm Ryan.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.160
Nice to meet you, Ryan.
You too.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.240
BEC: Bec.
JAMIE-LEE: Hi, Bec.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.840
You're beautiful. Nice to meet you.
How are you?

39:58.840 --> 39:59.840
Hi.
Hi.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.160
HOLLY: I see someone walk in
over to the fireplace.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.880
And I ran over.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.760
Hi!
How are you? I'm Jamie-Lee.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.040
Jamie-Lee. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.760
HOLLY: And I was, like, "Oh, my God!

40:10.760 --> 40:12.760
"I actually recognise you,

40:12.760 --> 40:16.720
"from Brooke's last season
on The Bachelor - Jamie-Lee."

40:16.720 --> 40:18.680
You've been on this show before,
though, haven't you?

40:18.680 --> 40:20.560
Yeah, I have.
I was literally...
I was just about to ask.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.520
Yeah. I was on Brooke's season.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.320
Oh, wow!
So we know each other. Yeah.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.840
Crazy.
Oh. Inside track.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.600
(LAUGHTER)

40:28.600 --> 40:31.000
(SIGHS) So, Jamie-Lee walking in,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.080
I think it's thrown
a massive spanner in the works.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.120
Having that connection already,
that's big.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.600
Bit more competition, lads.
It's all good.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.840
KONRAD: Damn!

40:42.840 --> 40:46.680
Yeah, Jamie-Lee, that's a wildcard.
That's a curve ball.

40:46.680 --> 40:49.360
Jamie-Lee, I think,
definitely has an upper hand.

40:49.360 --> 40:52.080
Like, they obviously know
each other. They have a history.

40:52.080 --> 40:55.160
But, I mean, uh, I hope I...
I resonate with Brooke

40:55.160 --> 40:57.400
more than Jamie-Lee does. (LAUGHS)

40:57.400 --> 41:00.440
That's all I'm gonna say.
(LAUGHS)

41:00.440 --> 41:03.360
Oh, man,
I'm starting to get a little...

41:03.360 --> 41:05.880
..little percolation
in the stomach, feeling...

41:05.880 --> 41:08.840
..thinking about
what's gonna happen soon.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.560
(TAPS GLASS)

41:13.560 --> 41:16.440
(CHEERING)

41:17.760 --> 41:20.120
Osher comes striding in
out of nowhere.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.760
(TAPS GLASS)
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening!

41:22.760 --> 41:24.960
MATT: He's looking pretty fly.
And everyone gets pretty excited.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.080
Whoo!

41:26.080 --> 41:28.840
I was really speechless
when I physically saw him.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.400
Come up here and join me,
why don't you?

41:30.400 --> 41:33.000
I'm hanging out with Osher?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.640
Yeah, boy!

41:37.400 --> 41:39.560
DARVID: We all know what this means.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.200
The time is now. We're on.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.600
Welcome to the mansion.
Welcome to your first cocktail party.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.920
I'm so happy you're all here.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.560
(CHEERING)

41:48.560 --> 41:53.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the first time in the world

41:53.760 --> 41:58.600
that both men and women will be vying
for the Bachelorette's heart.

41:58.600 --> 42:03.240
It's a beautiful thing, and
while the journey may be different,

42:03.240 --> 42:06.400
the destination is exactly the same.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.920
Brooke is here to find true love.

42:09.920 --> 42:13.520
And if that's the same reason
that you're here...

42:14.720 --> 42:17.040
..you're gonna need one of these.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.320
(CHEERING)
Whoo!

42:20.320 --> 42:23.040
Receiving a rose
from the Bachelorette

42:23.040 --> 42:27.880
means that Brooke sees something in
you that she wants to explore further

42:27.880 --> 42:32.320
in the hope
of turning an initial connection into

42:32.320 --> 42:37.000
a beautiful love
that can last a lifetime.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.560
And it is time alone with Brooke
on a single date

42:41.560 --> 42:45.960
where that love has the chance
to fully blossom.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.520
Which is where this comes in.

42:48.720 --> 42:51.000
(CONTESTANTS EXCLAIM)

42:51.000 --> 42:53.360
Oh!

42:56.160 --> 43:00.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the first impression rose.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.920
Brooke will give this to the person

43:01.920 --> 43:05.960
who makes the most lasting impression
upon her tonight.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.360
And if you receive this rose, Brooke
wants to see a lot more of you,

43:09.360 --> 43:13.400
because this rose
is also an invitation

43:13.400 --> 43:15.600
to the very first single date.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.080
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

43:17.080 --> 43:21.160
HOLLY: There were a few
oohs and aahs from all of us

43:21.160 --> 43:23.520
when the first impression rose
was announced,

43:23.520 --> 43:25.360
because I think it would be

43:25.360 --> 43:27.800
a really fantastic start
to the whole experience,

43:27.800 --> 43:31.320
getting the first single date,
so I'm going for it.

43:31.320 --> 43:34.640
OSHER:
Whatever you do, don't hold back,

43:34.640 --> 43:39.920
because this rose could be your
head start to winning Brooke's heart.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.520
Brooke has made
a massive first impression on me,

43:42.520 --> 43:46.000
so if I was to get the first
impression rose, I would be stoked.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.560
It would really sort of, you know,

43:47.560 --> 43:50.040
cement where I...
where I sit with Brooke.

43:50.040 --> 43:51.640
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:51.640 --> 43:53.200
are you ready to make history?

43:53.200 --> 43:55.040
CONTESTANTS: Yes!
(LAUGHS)

43:55.040 --> 43:59.360
Please join me in
welcoming your Bachelorette, Brooke!

43:59.360 --> 44:02.760
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

44:10.560 --> 44:12.840
KONRAD: Seeing Brooke
walk into the cocktail party

44:12.840 --> 44:15.560
is definitely
a pinch yourself moment.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.640
(CHEERING)

44:18.640 --> 44:21.440
CARISSA:
Brooke's walking down towards us

44:21.440 --> 44:23.640
and I am absolutely mesmerised.

44:23.640 --> 44:26.400
She's beautiful.
(CHEERING)

44:31.240 --> 44:34.120
Yeah, it's just a stunning sight.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.960
She's just...she...yeah.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.320
She's just...

44:37.320 --> 44:39.800
..just, oh...yeah.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.320
Oh! Well. Wow.

44:42.320 --> 44:46.160
I just want to
first of all say that, um,

44:46.160 --> 44:50.560
you all look
so handsome and so beautiful tonight,

44:50.560 --> 44:54.000
and I empathise
with where you guys are at

44:54.000 --> 44:56.200
in terms of your feelings,
your emotions.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.680
I've been there before.

44:57.680 --> 45:01.320
So everything that you're feeling
is completely and utterly normal.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.880
My heart is so warm

45:02.880 --> 45:07.360
and it is filled with so much
excitement for what is to come.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.600
I am really wanting
to find that love,

45:10.600 --> 45:12.680
an absolute true and real love,

45:12.680 --> 45:16.320
and I think after the
first impressions that you guys made

45:16.320 --> 45:17.800
on that red carpet,

45:17.800 --> 45:21.160
I really think it's in this room,
and I just want you all to know.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.400
So, I'd love to make a toast,

45:24.400 --> 45:28.680
and it's to this being
a beautiful experience,

45:28.680 --> 45:30.640
to real love...

45:30.640 --> 45:33.080
..in all forms, so...cheers to that.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.880
CONTESTANTS: Cheers!

45:34.880 --> 45:36.000
Cheers.
Cheers.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.560
Mmm. So let's have some fun.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.360
CONTESTANTS: Yes!

45:45.360 --> 45:47.000
Whoo!
Whoo!

45:47.000 --> 45:48.560
So...

45:48.560 --> 45:53.280
..Carissa, would you like to
take this first little walk?

45:53.280 --> 45:55.120
I would love to.
CONTESTANTS: Yay!

45:55.120 --> 45:57.200
(LAUGHS)

45:58.480 --> 46:00.920
Damn.
(LAUGHTER)

46:00.920 --> 46:02.120
Oh, OK.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.160
(LAUGHS)

46:03.160 --> 46:06.920
I couldn't believe that Brooke chose
me for the first chat, to be honest,

46:06.920 --> 46:10.040
I definitely was not expecting that.

46:11.160 --> 46:15.440
Oh, I'm so excited
that you chose to talk to me first.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.040
You on the red carpet
just made a huge impression on me.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.040
Just straightaway.
Did I?

46:20.040 --> 46:21.080
Absolutely.
Oh. I love that.

46:21.080 --> 46:24.600
And that's why I was, like, you
have to be the first person that I...

46:24.600 --> 46:26.160
Oh!
..come and grab.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.040
The turtle, the picture...

46:28.040 --> 46:29.040
I...
..it was so beautiful.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.400
..I just couldn't believe
the synchronicity with everything.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.400
Let's go interrupt 'em.

46:33.400 --> 46:37.600
(BOTH LAUGH)
30 seconds. That's enough.

46:37.600 --> 46:41.400
RYAN: I'm obviously feeling a little
bit down that Brooke picks Carissa

46:41.400 --> 46:42.880
to have that first chat.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.600
Who's gonna go interrupt first?
Mmm.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.000
RYAN: And now,
there's a lot of anticipation

46:48.000 --> 46:50.280
of who's gonna go butt in?

46:50.280 --> 46:54.640
It would be bold for
the first person to go over there.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.840
It's, like, what's a respectful
amount of time to let them...

46:57.840 --> 46:59.360
..get to know each other?

46:59.360 --> 47:01.200
10 minutes.
(LAUGHS)

47:01.200 --> 47:04.280
You have a beautiful smile. And eyes.
Oh. I was just looking at YOUR eyes.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.960
I was, like,
"Wow. They're so beautiful."

47:05.960 --> 47:08.160
(LAUGHS)

47:08.160 --> 47:10.600
MATT: Brooke and Carissa,
they were having such a nice chat.

47:10.600 --> 47:14.240
It just felt like...
should someone go interrupt this?

47:14.240 --> 47:17.240
I'm waiting for, like,
one of you boys kind of, like...

47:17.240 --> 47:18.840
Yeah.
I'm, like...not yet, no.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.560
Well, yeah.
No, I don't think...not yet either.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.440
I mean, I'm not fussed of going up,
to be honest.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.440
(LAUGHS)
No.

47:23.440 --> 47:24.920
I'm not fussed
of going up and interrupting.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.200
Really?
No.

47:26.200 --> 47:29.400
And then it just went all silent.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.160
(FOOTSTEPS)

47:34.160 --> 47:35.960
(GASPS) Oh.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.800
Someone's going.
Oh!

47:40.120 --> 47:42.680
Sorry to interrupt.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.280
(LAUGHS)
Taje.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.480
Just saying
whenever you get a sec...

47:47.480 --> 47:51.240
Holy shit. (LAUGHS) Wow. Um...

47:51.240 --> 47:52.720
The girls
are coming out with a bang.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.960
Oh.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.840
That hurts. I felt that.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.400
(LAUGHS)

48:11.680 --> 48:14.960
Sorry to interrupt.
(LAUGHS)

48:14.960 --> 48:19.040
Holy shit! (LAUGHS) Wow. Um...

48:19.040 --> 48:20.720
The girls
are coming out with a bang.

48:20.720 --> 48:21.760
Oh.

48:21.760 --> 48:24.280
That hurts. I felt that.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.000
(LAUGHS)

48:26.000 --> 48:28.280
I'm sorry to steal you away
like that.

48:28.280 --> 48:31.680
I obviously didn't want to...
Don't be silly.
..you know, interrupt.

48:31.680 --> 48:36.840
I didn't expect Taje to be so ballsy
and to be the first to interrupt.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.560
The confidence, I love it.

48:39.560 --> 48:41.640
Kind of, like, "Oh, hello."

48:41.640 --> 48:45.520
Confidence in a woman, it's
attractive. It's so self-assuring.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.760
It's, like, "I can hold my own."

48:47.760 --> 48:51.840
And I'm glad you've took that power,
'cause that's...that's...shows a lot.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.560
I love when women carry that.

48:53.560 --> 48:56.160
So sorry to interrupt you.
I'm not here to steal you yet.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.440
Whenever you're ready.
OK.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.440
Alright.
OK...

48:58.440 --> 49:01.520
They are coming in so hot.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.080
Feel like a very wanted woman
right now.

49:03.080 --> 49:06.440
You are a wanted woman.
And I feel like from the women.

49:06.440 --> 49:09.080
Yeah, yeah.
Like, where are...

49:09.080 --> 49:10.480
Like, I don't know
where the boys are at.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.720
I hate being... (SIGHS)

49:13.720 --> 49:16.960
..really at this time
wish I wasn't so nice.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.520
Like, are they being too polite?

49:18.520 --> 49:21.280
Are they trying
not to tread on anyone's toes?

49:21.280 --> 49:24.200
HOLLY: Guys, I'm getting in...
I'm getting in there next.

49:24.200 --> 49:26.720
I just...I...I haven't seen any.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.200
We're losing the battle
at the moment.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.960
So, Holls, let's go.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.840
HOLLY: Where do you want to go?

49:32.840 --> 49:35.960
But the women tonight, they are fire.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.040
Thank you for stealing me.
That's OK.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.200
You've full, like,
cut in front of, like...

49:40.200 --> 49:41.800
I know. I got in front of the boys.
..the big line.

49:41.800 --> 49:42.960
Yeah, the boys.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.560
(LAUGHS)
The girls all went in.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.080
Yeah.
Love the confidence.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.920
The boys are, like,
"Oh, yeah, yeah. We'll do it."

49:51.920 --> 49:54.720
And I'm, like, "Well...
you've got some stiff competition."

49:54.720 --> 49:57.040
Yeah. They do. They really do.

49:57.040 --> 50:00.760
The girls were just getting the time
in and all the boys were stressing.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.640
Here comes another one.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.920
Hold my hand. (LAUGHS)
OK.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.520
Pretty much all the girls
have had their chat.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.280
Nah.
(BROOKE LAUGHS)

50:10.280 --> 50:12.520
It was just
girl after girl after girl.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.840
I...I'm fully not interrupting,
but when you guys are done,

50:14.840 --> 50:17.680
I'm gonna be sitting in there
and hopefully you'll come join me.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.080
Seriously, like,
the boys needed to step up.

50:20.080 --> 50:23.240
Uh, we...we definitely
need some boys to...

50:23.240 --> 50:25.120
Yeah, yeah.
There's been,
like, six girls, I think.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.040
If we don't pick up our game,
all the lads are going home.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.760
KONRAD: I know.

50:33.400 --> 50:37.200
I'm watching the other girls talk to
Brooke and have their opportunity,

50:37.200 --> 50:41.080
and I just...I really want
to have a really good chat with her.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.880
Do youse have a bit of a game plan
how youse might,

50:43.880 --> 50:46.280
you know,
get some personal time with her?

50:46.280 --> 50:47.520
I did make a pinky promise with her.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.800
Yeah.
Did ya?

50:48.800 --> 50:52.600
Yeah, that we'd...we'd test out
the seat in a special spot, so...

50:52.600 --> 50:55.000
Tonight, I've got a plan.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.920
I, um, obviously
built a love seat with Brooke

50:57.920 --> 51:00.240
just before on the red carpet,

51:00.240 --> 51:02.280
hopefully, you know,
we can create some memories on

51:02.280 --> 51:04.280
that we can cherish in the future.

51:04.280 --> 51:08.920
So...I would love to get a moment
on the love seat with Brooke

51:08.920 --> 51:12.320
and then, yeah,
fulfil the pinky promise.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.720
Pinky promise is a pinky promise.
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

51:14.720 --> 51:16.080
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

51:16.080 --> 51:18.320
Hey, it's a binding contract.
You know?

51:18.320 --> 51:20.320
That's exactly right.
It's unwritten law, mate.

51:20.320 --> 51:23.360
I did find a nice spot for it
in the backyard.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.920
So you made her a love seat?
It is just over there. I did.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.400
Well, we did...made it together.
Yeah.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.400
Oh, nice.
Yeah. So...

51:33.400 --> 51:36.600
KONRAD: And, yeah, and I think
I made it pretty clear with everyone

51:36.600 --> 51:39.520
that I thought it would be
nice and...and respectful,

51:39.520 --> 51:41.560
um, if everyone let Brooke and I

51:41.560 --> 51:44.680
have the first opportunity
to use the love seat.

51:44.680 --> 51:46.000
That's a nice-looking chair,
I reckon.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.400
It IS a nice chair.
He's done well.

51:48.400 --> 51:49.760
You need some, like,
pillows and stuff.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.160
Yeah.
And blanket.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.240
Like, you can't just sit on it
like that!

51:54.240 --> 51:56.120
KONRAD: You reckon?

51:56.120 --> 51:59.320
Konrad, um, hasn't had a chance
to talk to Brooke yet, and...

51:59.320 --> 52:00.520
..I mean, I was looking at his chair.

52:00.520 --> 52:03.000
It looked pretty...pretty lonely.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.480
It didn't have anything on it.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.000
Should we get a pillow now
and put it over there

52:06.000 --> 52:07.480
so it's, like, nice and comfy?

52:07.480 --> 52:09.320
You reckon?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

52:09.320 --> 52:13.240
So I was like, "No! You can't...
you can't sit on it like that!"

52:13.240 --> 52:16.680
Like, what are you thinking?
That's such a bloke thought process.

52:16.680 --> 52:20.640
You can't just sit on it,
like, all basic!

52:20.640 --> 52:23.080
That's just boring. And it'd
probably be really uncomfortable.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.960
(LAUGHS)

52:24.960 --> 52:27.080
So I grab some pillows and, yeah...

52:27.080 --> 52:29.280
..and just made it
a little bit more comfier for him.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.680
(LAUGHS)

52:30.680 --> 52:32.160
You're the best.
Give me a high five.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.160
Yes, man! Come on.
Thank you.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.560
Let's go get this.
This is good.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.720
Gotta help a fella out. (LAUGHS)

52:37.720 --> 52:39.880
KONRAD: Now I need a plan
to get her to the seat, right?

52:39.880 --> 52:42.520
Oh, OK, so...
there's a few people waiting.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.480
Yeah. Who's in the line?

52:46.040 --> 52:49.320
How we doing, guys?
Yeah, I am talking to her next.

52:49.320 --> 52:52.200
I'm just gonna let her
have her turn with Bec and...

52:52.200 --> 52:54.880
..then I'll be ready for my chat.

52:54.880 --> 52:59.000
I want some time with Brooke because
I do have a lot to offer Brooke.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.880
I believe that there are qualities
in myself that she will like.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.120
Where are you gonna go sit?

53:06.120 --> 53:08.320
Can't tell you that.

53:08.320 --> 53:10.440
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

53:10.440 --> 53:12.080
Can't tell you that.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.560
I'll just save that for the moment.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.040
Yeah, fair enough.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.600
I want to just do
something a little bit different

53:17.600 --> 53:21.960
and take her somewhere nice in the
garden, somewhere...nice lighting,

53:21.960 --> 53:24.320
and, um...yeah.

53:24.320 --> 53:26.800
I'm not gonna lose the opportunity.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.560
I can't now. It looks so good.
You can't! You can't!

53:29.560 --> 53:31.480
Like, this is your creation.
Yeah.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.320
And you can't leave without sitting
in your own creation, you know?

53:34.320 --> 53:36.320
Yeah, true.
Like, you gotta test it out.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.960
Yes, I...
I feel hypes from the girls.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.120
I'm excited for you.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.600
I feel like...I'm getting, like,
residual butterflies, because you...

53:42.600 --> 53:46.240
From me?
Now I'm, like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

53:46.240 --> 53:48.280
Shoot your shot. Like...

53:48.280 --> 53:51.080
I think it's...it's my time to...
to go and just let Brooke know

53:51.080 --> 53:53.000
that I'm...
you know, when she's ready,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.760
I'd like to have a chat
on the love seat.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.360
Go up there. Go up there.
OK. Alright.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.720
Good luck.
Yep.
Thank you.

53:58.720 --> 54:00.440
You got it. (LAUGHS)

54:01.800 --> 54:05.200
So, I'm walking up
towards the fire pit...

54:05.200 --> 54:07.080
You go over...
Yeah.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.960
..you go over to her,
bring her over to your love chair...

54:08.960 --> 54:12.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey? (LAUGHS)

54:12.360 --> 54:16.680
KONRAD: And all of a sudden, I see
Jess and...and Brooke walking down.

54:16.680 --> 54:19.120
(SIGHS)

54:19.120 --> 54:20.600
You look beautiful.
YOU look beautiful.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.160
Thank you.

54:22.160 --> 54:25.160
KONRAD: And they're heading
towards the back.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.480
I wonder where
Jess is gonna go take a seat.

54:27.480 --> 54:29.280
KONRAD:
And she just takes a hard right

54:29.280 --> 54:31.840
and she's heading
straight for the love seat.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.840
She's so got the love seat.
(BLEEP)!

54:34.840 --> 54:39.160
As I'm walking around the garden,
I noticed Konrad's love seat.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.240
We're doing it.
Over here?
Yes.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.040
Oh, wow!
Uh-oh.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.000
KONRAD: Don't you sit on it.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.320
(GASPS) No!
What?

54:46.320 --> 54:48.480
Oh, my God. She's doing it.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.960
And I took it.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.520
This looks very familiar.
(BOTH LAUGH)

54:54.520 --> 54:56.080
I thought this was Konrad's spot.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.480
It is.
It is?

54:57.480 --> 54:59.400
And I've stolen it.
Oh, my God!

54:59.400 --> 55:01.480
You've fully boycotted his...
I did.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.480
(GASPS) He's not gonna be happy.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.360
KONRAD: Oh, and she sat on it.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.880
Oh, my God, no! (GASPS)
Oh!
She did not!

55:09.880 --> 55:12.560
(BLEEP)!
(GROWLS)

55:12.560 --> 55:13.680
(WOMAN GASPS)

55:16.720 --> 55:18.640
You're kidding me.

55:18.640 --> 55:20.160
OK, wow.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.400
That's meant to be YOUR love chair.

55:21.400 --> 55:23.600
That's (BLEEP).

55:23.600 --> 55:25.280
You are kidding me.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.640
Shots fired.

55:26.640 --> 55:27.640
Bro!

55:27.640 --> 55:31.560
I think everyone was in shock at
the same moment. How disrespectful.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.120
How dare you?
Absolutely how dare you?

55:34.120 --> 55:37.320
I think it's absolutely, like,
disrespectful as hell.

55:37.320 --> 55:39.800
WOMAN: The audacity.
BEAU: Holy shit.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.360
Our faces are, like...

55:41.360 --> 55:44.040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She did not.
Oh!

55:44.040 --> 55:45.680
She did not!
Is he OK?

56:00.640 --> 56:03.040
KONRAD: Oh, and she sat on it.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.680
Oh, my God, no! (GASPS)
Oh!
She did not.

56:06.680 --> 56:09.280
OK, wow.
That's meant to be YOUR love chair.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.000
That's (BLEEP).

56:11.000 --> 56:12.640
You are kidding me.

56:12.640 --> 56:14.120
WOMAN: The audacity.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.600
WOMAN 2: Is he OK?

56:17.840 --> 56:19.320
WOMAN 3:
I definitely wasn't expecting that.

56:22.800 --> 56:26.160
I think everyone in the party
felt a little bit sad for Konrad.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.160
I DO feel for him.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.720
Absolutely.
Like, I just think it's shit.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.680
Oh, my God. I feel bad for Konrad.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.720
I feel like he's really upset.
Oh, no.

56:33.720 --> 56:36.080
You reckon she planned that,
had the spot ready?

56:36.080 --> 56:38.040
I think so, 'cause when I asked her,

56:38.040 --> 56:39.600
"Do you know
where you're gonna go," she...

56:39.600 --> 56:41.200
She just, what, lit up?
..she was, like, "Yeah."

56:41.200 --> 56:42.960
What's the point of that?
"I know where I'm gonna go."

56:42.960 --> 56:45.200
She's kind of a bit like that,
a little bit as if there was...

56:45.200 --> 56:46.680
Like, what's the...
..something more to it.

56:46.680 --> 56:48.280
That's not nice.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.480
DARVID: I'm not happy at all
with Jess, because...

56:50.480 --> 56:54.120
..Jess taking Brooke to the
love seat was definitely a dog act.

56:54.120 --> 56:57.360
Konrad. How do you feel about that?
How do I feel about it?

56:57.360 --> 56:58.680
Yeah.
Yeah.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.840
I mean...
oh, just a bit of a respect thing.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.280
KONRAD:
I'm definitely feeling a bit hurt,

57:02.280 --> 57:05.080
'cause it had more meaning
than just being a seat.

57:05.080 --> 57:09.080
It was something that, you know,
we were meant to...to sit on

57:09.080 --> 57:11.600
and create a moment
that we're gonna cherish,

57:11.600 --> 57:15.360
and she's just gone
and tainted that moment, so...

57:15.360 --> 57:17.600
..yeah, I'm not a fan.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.240
You know what,
actually think it would be fitting

57:19.240 --> 57:21.760
if you went over there first,
because it is your chair.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.040
Really?

57:23.040 --> 57:24.800
Definitely.
Yeah.
Make yourself known.

57:24.800 --> 57:26.680
Alright. I'll say something.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.760
(SNIFFS AND EXHALES)

57:30.760 --> 57:34.760
I would...take ownership of it,
you know. Like, reclaim that seat.

57:34.760 --> 57:36.680
Really?
Reclaim it!

57:40.280 --> 57:43.160
He's actually doing it.
What's going on?
Oh, my God, yes.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.560
Uh-oh.
How is it g... "Uh-oh"?

57:46.560 --> 57:49.600
(ALL LAUGH)
How is it? Is it comfy?

57:49.600 --> 57:52.160
It is. Thank you.
Good.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.800
I feel so deceitful.
I'm so sorry, Konrad.

57:54.800 --> 57:56.360
So deceitful? No, it's alright.

57:56.360 --> 57:57.800
I was just gonna say,
I would...like,

57:57.800 --> 57:59.400
would I be able
to have a chat with you on it?

57:59.400 --> 58:00.720
Absolutely.
Sweet.

58:00.720 --> 58:03.440
JESS: I honestly don't think
that I have any regret

58:03.440 --> 58:06.600
that I've stolen
Konrad's time to shine.

58:06.600 --> 58:07.880
You've got to do what you got to do.

58:07.880 --> 58:11.480
And it was sort of
just a...a bit of fun.

58:11.480 --> 58:12.880
No.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.000
(LAUGHS) I don't know.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.200
That's the word
that came to my head.

58:16.200 --> 58:18.240
I'm coming.
Oh, you're coming here?

58:18.240 --> 58:20.680
Yep.
We got to have words with you.

58:20.680 --> 58:22.480
We got to have words.
Oh, guys!

58:22.480 --> 58:25.840
There's controversy.
Come on! Oh, I know. I know.

58:25.840 --> 58:27.560
There's controversy now.
I know.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.640
Was that planned?
Yeah.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.560
(MEN LAUGH)
It is what it is.

58:31.560 --> 58:34.280
Just sort of wanted to...

58:34.280 --> 58:35.320
..to take her somewhere nice.

58:35.320 --> 58:37.920
(LAUGHS) The evil!

58:37.920 --> 58:39.920
KURT:
So it was really surprising to see

58:39.920 --> 58:42.640
that Jess doesn't care about
what she did.

58:42.640 --> 58:46.320
That's disrespect, man.
Massive disrespect.

58:46.320 --> 58:49.360
Oh, well. It...it is what it is.
(LAUGHS)

58:49.360 --> 58:51.120
I couldn't believe it - there was...

58:51.120 --> 58:53.960
..just shock running
through my body more than anything.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.600
Claws are out, eh?
Claws are out.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.320
(LAUGHS) Look, sometimes
you gotta do what you gotta do.

59:00.320 --> 59:02.400
(LAUGHS)

59:03.760 --> 59:06.120
Yeah, right.

59:07.200 --> 59:08.720
KURT: I'm just thinking,
"What the hell?"

59:08.720 --> 59:12.360
Like...I was... (BLEEP)! (LAUGHS)

59:20.400 --> 59:21.880
BROOKE: How you feeling?

59:21.880 --> 59:24.680
I'm a lot better now.
I feel a lot better.

59:24.680 --> 59:29.920
I definitely have my deal of
dramatics with Konrad, because...

59:29.920 --> 59:31.400
..I feel deceitful.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.360
I feel like I did you a dirty,
to be honest.

59:33.360 --> 59:35.040
No, you didn't.
What are you gonna do?

59:35.040 --> 59:37.200
I know. I'm, like, not a...
You weren't gonna be, like...it's...

59:37.200 --> 59:39.560
You know, I kind of, like,
feel a little bit awkward.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.080
Yeah.
"I don't know what to do."

59:41.080 --> 59:45.600
But...you know what? We're here. And
this set-up, right near the tree...

59:45.600 --> 59:48.560
It's not bad, huh?
Trusty old love seat.

59:48.560 --> 59:50.720
The love s...?
Are we calling it the love seat?
Project Love Seat.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.280
I have sketches in my sketchbook.
(GASPS)

59:52.280 --> 59:55.760
It was all...yeah.
It was planned for a while, so...

59:55.760 --> 59:56.960
You planned it for a while?
Yeah.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.360
Konrad. Wow.

59:58.360 --> 1:00:01.240
But he was such a gentleman about it.

1:00:01.240 --> 1:00:03.200
And you look dapper.
Thank you so much.

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:06.280
Not that...you know, the...
little tradie was...

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:08.520
Did you like that?
It was doing it for me.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:09.520
Really?

1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:11.560
BROOKE: So as much as things
didn't go quite to plan,

1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:15.400
I do still feel like our love seat
moment was very special.

1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:18.440
And we built
a very strong foundation.

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.400
Thank you.
Thank YOU.

1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:22.000
I did love that.
That was really nice.

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.440
I'll walk you over.
(SIGHS)

1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:27.560
BROOKE: And although the guys were
a little slow off the mark tonight...

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.280
Sorry, I'm nervous.
Why are you nervous?

1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:31.840
I don't know.
'Cause you're so good-lookin'.

1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:33.680
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God!
(CLEARS THROAT)

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:35.520
Brookie!
BROOKE: How ARE you?

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:36.640
BB.

1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:38.440
Go the boys.

1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:40.160
BROOKE: ..they are definitely
making up for it now.

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:42.600
The boys are on here.
(ALL LAUGH)

1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:44.720
I'm hoping my heartbeat
returns to normal at some stage...

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:46.960
Let me feel it.
..this century.

1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:48.560
Yep. That's the same as mine.
Yep? Rapid?

1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:50.320
Yep.
Awesome.
Intense.

1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:51.600
Sorry to interrupt, guys.

1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:53.080
That's alright, man.
Sorry to interrupt.

1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:55.160
I know there's a bit of a line
going for you, Brookie.
I know!

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:56.520
I know,
and it's just...it's...it's...

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:58.800
It's chaos!
It is, and it's a dogfight.

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:00.800
I will come find you. I promise.
OK.

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:04.000
This cocktail party
is actually so much fun.

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.840
I was already blown away

1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.840
by the impressions of everyone
on the red carpet,

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:13.080
but even more now after
these chats at the cocktail party.

1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:14.960
You rocked up on that lawnmower.
(DARVID LAUGHS)

1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:18.360
You had this, like, really glycerine
jacket, which I did not expect,

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:21.000
especially for a lawnmower. (LAUGHS)

1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.560
I thought that was a good contrast.
Well, I love that.

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:24.800
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:26.680
You left
a really good impression on me.

1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:27.680
That's nice.

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:31.800
There was so much more to everyone
than I anticipated.

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:33.640
You make me actually really nervous.
Why is that?

1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:35.640
I don't know.

1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:38.880
You make me calm
but equally just as nervous.

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.560
That's a good thing.
Yeah.

1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:43.440
As soon as I saw you in person,
like, "Oh, my God!"

1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:44.440
You're just gorgeous.

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:47.400
You've got beautiful eyes,
a really nice smile, which is...

1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:48.880
Stop it.
..breaking me, but...

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:50.280
(LAUGHS) Breaking!
Seriously.

1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:52.760
That's...that was my two weaknesses.
I was, like... (EXHALES)

1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:55.800
Brooke and I
seem to get along quite easily.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:58.120
Let me hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.

1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:01.760
We're getting close. She's holding
my hand. It all feels natural.

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:03.080
I really like spending time with you.

1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:04.440
Me too.
It's really nice.
Mmm.

1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:06.920
My Persian prince.
That'll stick, won't it?

1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:08.160
(LAUGHS)
It will stick.

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:10.320
DARVID: It feels like
something out of a fairytale.

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:13.200
So, yeah, I couldn't be happier.

1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:17.960
BROOKE: I'm gonna steal Jamie-Lee.

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:19.080
She's got Jamie-Lee.

1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:21.440
That is OK with me. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:23.280
Oh!

1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:24.960
(BLEEP)!

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:26.440
Heading to the gazebo.

1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:30.680
JAMIE-LEE: I'm so happy that Brooke
comes to me first to chat to her.

1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:32.960
I'm so happy.
(LAUGHS) YOU say.

1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:36.000
JAMIE-LEE: I don't want to start
this off with a target on my back,

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:41.960
so I'm trying my best
in this situation to...to be fair

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:44.080
and respectful of everyone here.

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:45.920
I'm so glad
that you came and got me.

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:49.720
I feel...I don't want to step on
anyone's toes to get time with you.

1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:51.760
I know.
Um...yeah.

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:53.640
I...
You've been patiently waiting.

1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:55.640
I know. I get it.
(LAUGHS)

1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:59.400
I'm, um...I'm so glad
to be here with you, for real.

1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:01.040
It was...it...I'm gonna be honest.

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.800
It was a complete and utter shock
when I saw you on the red carpet.

1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:07.480
It was...such a gamble.

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:09.200
I didn't know
if you would just be, like, "Nuh."

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:12.520
"Nuh. Turn around, bitch." (LAUGHS)
"See ya later. See ya later."

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:13.840
You know, like...
Yeah.

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:16.520
..I didn't know
if you felt the same way about me,

1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:21.480
you know, like...there were
so many times in the mansion where

1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:23.880
I would, like, want to, like,
sneak over to your bed.

1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:26.440
But I just...I didn't know.

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:27.680
It...it was scary, 'cause...

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.640
..if I had have put my feelings out
there and you ended up with Nick,

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.560
then I would have lost you
as a friend.

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:37.360
I'll be honest with you, Jamie,
like...

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:41.440
..I had feelings for you
in the house.

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:44.560
Just know that.
That's so nice to hear.

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:49.400
But I knew that I was there,
obviously, for Nick.

1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:51.560
I was conflicted.
So was I.

1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:53.480
JAMIE-LEE: For three years,

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:56.080
I've wondered
if this has been one-sided,

1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.280
and to hear it come out of her mouth
that she had feelings for me

1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:01.680
feels incredible.

1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:04.680
I kind of felt like...you know,

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.480
it was, like, a bit
of a sliding door moment with us.

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:09.560
Like, it was kind of, like...
Yeah.

1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:12.640
..wrong place type thing, you know.

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:15.360
It wasn't the right...

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.480
..time or place.

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:19.480
I agree.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.000
Brooke kind of says
that our friendship/relationship

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.520
was like a sliding door moment,
you know,

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:30.400
we never were in the same place
at the same time,

1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:33.040
and I think that's why
this feels so right, you know.

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:34.080
It's...

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:36.040
..it's just perfect timing.

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:38.360
I'm so glad that you're here.

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.280
Because...

1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:44.560
..I think you are as beautiful as the
day that I met you, and I think...

1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:47.000
You make me giddy, you know that?
(LAUGHS)

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.800
Come here. Give me a hug.
I'm so excited.

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:52.960
For real.
Oh! No, like, hug me, like, properly.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.360
Like...

1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:57.320
And... (LAUGHS)
..I don't know, it's...

1:04:57.320 --> 1:05:00.400
(SIGHS)
..I just really want to kiss her.

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:10.720
BROOKE:
The thought of kissing Jamie-Lee

1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:12.760
crossed my mind,
like, four or five times.

1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:15.360
(LAUGHS)

1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:18.360
Well, it has been a long wait
and it's just so much anticipation.

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:20.480
I know what I want now.

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:23.600
Like, I so know what I want.
I know where I want my future.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:26.920
And I think that we have
so much in common.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:29.280
Me too. There's no doubt about that.
Yeah.

1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:31.600
BROOKE:
There's a really physical attraction.

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.120
There's an emotional attraction.

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:36.400
We've never been able
to, like, actually act on it.

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:40.560
But...I'm here. She's here.
This is our perfect moment.

1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:43.280
Why would I not want to go for it?

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:47.240
I wouldn't have been here for
anyone else. Just know that, OK?

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.560
I know. I know.
(LAUGHS)

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:49.800
I know.

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.440
I'm sorry.

1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:06.440
(LAUGHS)

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.840
(SIGHS)

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.960
BROOKE: Yeah. It was pretty hot.

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.400
(LAUGHS)

1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:35.840
Oh!

1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:37.800
I've been waiting so long
to do that.

1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:39.560
I would have done it
on the red carpet if I had, like...

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:42.200
I thought about it.
I thought about it.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:46.920
I'm feeling so many emotions.
(LAUGHS) So many...

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:49.360
I'm excited. Oh, my God.

1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:50.920
Wow.

1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:16.440
HOLLY:
Where is she? Where is Brooke?

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:21.000
She's having a chat
with, um, Jamie in the gazebo.

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.040
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:27.720
God.

1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:29.880
Something special there.

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:32.800
Do you reckon
she's got the white rose?

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:34.640
Yeah.

1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:36.120
I mean,
I think Jamie-Lee's...I mean...

1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:39.360
Frontrunner?
For white rose, though?

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:42.400
I just don't think that it's fair if
Jamie-Lee, as soon as she walked in,

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.160
got the first impression rose.

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:46.840
Well, when...
when you think about it, it's like...

1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:50.160
..a bit like...almost like an unfair
advantage, you could say, because...

1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:52.640
Yeah.
..technically,
it's not a first impression.

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:54.000
BEC: I'm so interested
to see who gets it.

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.560
Yeah, me too.

1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:59.400
BEC: Basically, if you get
this first impression rose,

1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:01.920
you get the first, first date,

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:03.560
which is massive.

1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:06.320
Like, that first date,
that's priceless.

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:08.960
Time is very precious here.

1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:11.360
So, I mean, yeah, everyone wants it.

1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:13.520
Look, I'd love it.

1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:14.640
Everyone wants it.

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.520
It's a big deal.
You get a whole day with her.

1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:23.960
I mean, everyone has been losing it
over 10 minutes, man.

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:25.120
Mmm.
It'd be sick.

1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:27.600
I want it.
Yeah. Me too.

1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:29.280
Do you?
Do you think you'll get it or what?

1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:32.240
Oh, I think there's
a couple of competitors here, hey?

1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:34.680
Yeah. There definitely is.

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:38.880
Oh. Oh, oh.
Oh, oh!

1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:44.560
MEN: Ooh!

1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:48.840
(GASPS) She has the white rose.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:08:48.840 --> 1:08:49.840
Oh, God.

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:54.520
STEVE: All eyes are on Brooke
walking down the stairs...

1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:56.040
No way!

1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:58.080
STEVE: ..white rose in hand.

1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:02.840
But she walks straight past me
at the fire pit.

1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:05.400
Dammit.

1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:07.120
It's the girls.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:10.880
Oh, it's all the girls.
(WOMEN LAUGH)

1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:13.840
All of us was hoping
it was gonna be one of the girls.

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:17.000
Who do we think? Who do we think?
To the left. I'm saying Holly.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.440
(EXHALES)

1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:20.840
MAN: Carissa?

1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:22.360
Wait. Is she gonna go left?
Oh, she's going...

1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:24.800
HOLLY:
But then she just spun on her heels

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:28.320
and went over to the boys
off to our left.

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:29.640
(GASPS)

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:31.240
Oh, shit. OK.

1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:35.280
I'm gonna say Konrad.

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.080
My heart's racing.

1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:38.600
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:41.600
Could be Darvid. Could be Darvid.

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:45.800
Can I steal...

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:47.080
(LAUGHS)

1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:50.440
..Darvid?

1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:52.880
MEN: Oh!

1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:54.480
Yeah, champ.
Yes, buddy!

1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:57.320
Yes!
(APPLAUSE)

1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:00.200
Darvid!
CONTESTANTS: Yes!

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:01.720
WOMAN: Yes.

1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:04.600
Oh, dammit!

1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:06.560
I felt like it was gonna be me.

1:10:06.560 --> 1:10:10.000
I knew I should have had a mower.
Landscaper.

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.840
BEAU: But, like, it's great.
It's a guy.

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:13.760
The guys are off to a...
to a head start.

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:16.200
We're winning, baby.
We're winning. (LAUGHS)

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:17.680
Heart's racing. Yeah.
Really?

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:20.240
Yeah. It is.
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:22.160
It's fine. Just breathe.
(SIGHS)

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.880
So... (SIGHS)

1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:26.080
..I guess I should start off by...

1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:27.480
..saying...

1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:31.600
..I am a really big person
on first impressions.

1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:32.680
Mmm.

1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:34.600
And...

1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:39.240
..you made a very good impression
on me on that red carpet,

1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:41.720
a very lasting impression.

1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:44.040
Just everything was just...nice.
That's awesome.

1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:46.160
(LAUGHS)
Make me feel so calm.

1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:51.200
And you came to me
and you said you had three wishes...
Yes.

1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:53.120
..and one was that
you were there on that red carpet.

1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:54.480
Yep.

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:55.560
So...

1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:57.760
..I would like to use
one of those wishes.

1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.800
Darvid...
Yep?

1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:04.120
..will you grant me the wish
and accept this impression rose?

1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:05.880
Of course. I will.

1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.440
Of course.

1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:12.760
Love it. Yes, a boy!

1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:14.960
DARVID: Sitting on the ride-on mower
with a big smile on my face,

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:16.440
it's all worth it.

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:20.760
Yeah, I'm...I'm excited for the
first date and...and what's to come.

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:23.560
Ride in on a mower
and ride out with a white rose.

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.600
MAN: Absolute Persian prince.
(HOLLY LAUGHS)

1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:27.240
Fair enough.
Well done.

1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:28.680
How good's this?
Man!

1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:31.720
Obviously, I would have
really, really seriously loved

1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:33.440
to have...have got it.

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:36.840
Oh, that smells like victory
right there.

1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:38.160
(LAUGHTER)

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:41.560
But at least it wasn't Jess.
(LAUGHS)

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:56.000
KONRAD: I'm not sure
what Jess's intentions are.

1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.120
I don't like what she did earlier
with the love seat.

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:03.360
I mean, it shows
the kind of person she is.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:06.520
So...if she got a rose
over me tonight

1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:09.080
would be rubbing salt in the wound,
it would suck.

1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:13.880
JESS: I'm hoping
that the fact I was being confident

1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:16.360
taking Brooke to the love seat

1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:20.440
that I have really shown
what kind of person I am.

1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:25.000
I'm not worried about
anyone else's experience in this.

1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:34.440
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:38.000
Welcome to your first rose ceremony.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.600
Not only your first rose ceremony

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:43.760
but a rose ceremony
that will go down in history.

1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:46.200
With both men and women here,

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:51.760
who Brooke chooses to give a rose to
will reflect only one thing -

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:54.520
who it is
she feels a connection with.

1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:59.280
And some of you have already made
a strong connection with Brooke.

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:01.960
No more so than Darvid.
(LAUGHS)

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:04.520
Tonight, you are safe.

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:10.400
You'll notice that Jamie-Lee
isn't in the room with us.

1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:13.680
She's not feeling well
and won't be joining us.

1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:17.760
Brooke has already
guaranteed Jamie-Lee a rose.

1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:21.000
This leaves 14 of you without a rose.

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.360
And tonight,
Brooke has only 13 roses to give.

1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:28.840
I'm sorry, but one of you
will be leaving the mansion tonight.

1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:32.440
I wish you all the very best.

1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:34.160
Here's Brooke.

1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:39.280
KONRAD: Tonight has been
a crazy roller-coaster of emotions.

1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.400
So, who IS gonna get the first rose?

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:34.520
Holly.

1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:44.360
Holly. Will you accept this rose?
Yes.

1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:46.280
I would love to. Thank you.
(LAUGHS)

1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:07.160
Kurt.

1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:13.880
Kurt. Will you accept this rose?

1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:15.120
I will.

1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:25.560
Carissa.

1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:32.960
Carissa. (LAUGHS)
Will you accept this rose?

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:35.880
I'd love to. Thank you.

1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:37.080
You ego-builder.

1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:38.640
(BOTH LAUGH)

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:42.680
KONRAD: I really hope that Brooke
has seen the true sides of Jess

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:44.000
with what she did earlier.

1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:48.280
I feel like it was very calculated.

1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:50.120
Ritu.

1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.440
Oh, God.

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:56.760
KONRAD: She stole my first moment
from me with Brooke.

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:58.240
Taje.

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:04.120
KONRAD: So I think it's
really important I get a rose now.

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:06.560
Beau.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:26.120
Konrad.

1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:35.080
Konrad, will you accept this rose?

1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:36.800
Of course I will. I'd love to.
Good. (LAUGHS)

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:41.880
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:46.280
JESS: I'm starting to really wonder

1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:48.800
if perhaps
I had done the wrong thing.

1:16:57.840 --> 1:16:59.120
Ryan.

1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:05.960
Bec.

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:12.120
Matt.

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:17.560
Emily.

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:22.400
JESS: I deserve to stay so that
Brooke can get to know me better

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:25.000
and she can really get to see
the real me.

1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:28.560
(SIGHS)

1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:44.360
Steve.

1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:24.200
Jess.

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:32.520
Jess. Will you accept this rose?

1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:33.840
Absolutely.
Thank you.

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:50.920
Johann.

1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:53.880
I'm sorry,
but you did not receive a rose.

1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:56.360
Could you take the time now
to please say goodbye?

1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:02.920
KONRAD: Jess knew
what she was doing. It was hurtful.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.960
I'll always be wary around her.

1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:12.400
But at the end of the day,

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:14.600
I'm here for Brooke.

1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:21.280
OSHER:
Tomorrow on The Bachelorette...

1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:25.120
Today's group date is a photoshoot.

1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:26.920
(CHEERING)
(LAUGHS)

1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:30.200
Everyone strives for picture-perfect.

1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:31.480
(WOMEN SQUEAL)
Ugh!

1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:33.360
And history repeats.

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:35.160
Like, can you...scooch over?

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:37.120
You gonna push me out of the seat?
Yeah.

1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:42.040
But this time,
Konrad won't back down.

1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:44.560
Go big.
You know, you got nothing to lose.

1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:46.160
But it's Holly...

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:49.040
..that sees sparks fly...

1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:51.120
Oh, my God!

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.240
..before a controversial move...

1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:55.760
My initial reaction is, "Dick."

1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:58.200
..backfires spectacularly.

1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:00.400
I'm no longer trusting you.
That is what it is.

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:02.400
