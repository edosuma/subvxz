WEBVTT

00:10.760 --> 00:14.014
Life has been so hectic lately.
Work is crazy.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.224
They gave us all new keyboards.

00:18.435 --> 00:22.021
Oh, you're done. I thought
you were gonna list more things.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.442
I have more, but it would just
stress me out to talk about it, so...

00:25.525 --> 00:27.193
I know, my life lately is just--

00:27.277 --> 00:30.321
The baby's teething,
my sister won another award for bravery.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.991
She carried two Navy SEALs
to her helicopter.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.994
"Julie has upper body strength,
let's all give her a prize."

00:36.077 --> 00:37.829
And somebody at work
is stealing my breast milk.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.915
I think it's Todd.
He's the only one who eats cereal.

00:40.999 --> 00:44.502
-So there were more things.
-So how are you?

00:45.253 --> 00:47.547
My life's been... a little intense.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.467
What? Tell me. And be very specific.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.844
Well, the other day...

00:54.804 --> 00:57.265
-I misplaced my pen.
-Aww.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.184
-But then I found it.
-Oh.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.478
So with all that craziness going on,

01:01.561 --> 01:03.813
tomorrow we're taking a family day
at the beach.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.400
There's this food truck
that Abby loves near the pier.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.986
They sell fresh oysters
and you shuck them yourself.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.281
-Oh, that sounds wonderful.
-Oh, it's heaven.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.742
You throw your blanket down,
we listen to the waves.

01:15.825 --> 01:20.705
-Not a care in the world.
-God, I love the beach. It's so peaceful.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.958
When I was a little girl,
we'd go there and fly kites.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.251
Oh, fuck!

01:26.878 --> 01:28.797
I fucking love kites.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.716
In the fucking sky,
amongst the fucking clouds.

01:32.425 --> 01:36.429
Boy, you're unusually passionate
about kites. That's awesome!

01:36.513 --> 01:39.349
How have we never talked about this?
Do you prefer single line or double?

01:39.432 --> 01:41.976
Whatever makes them go! Go!

01:42.060 --> 01:45.146
-Go that way!
-[Alondra laughs]

01:45.230 --> 01:49.734
-So exciting. We have to fly together.
-Oh, my God, we do.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.862
-But right now, you have got to leave.
-What? Why?

01:52.946 --> 01:56.032
Why? [laughs] Because...

01:57.117 --> 02:01.579
it's canning season and the peaches
may already have gone bad.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.249
-You like canning, too?
-Get out!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.167
[gasps]

02:07.627 --> 02:10.630
-What happened?
-I killed Dan.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.340
I thought you were just going
to talk to him.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.468
Negotiations broke down,
so I hit him in the head with a shovel.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.681
-Oh, my God!
-It just happened.

02:19.764 --> 02:22.475
He was threatening to send you to jail
and saying mean things,

02:22.559 --> 02:23.810
and you kinda had to be there.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.436
Come on, grab his leg.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.813
-Let's get him inside.
-Okay.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.606
[grunting]

02:28.690 --> 02:31.442
I really appreciate you
wanting to protect me from him.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.945
It's so sweet. It's so gallant.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.447
Oh, but I can't believe
you killed our neighbor...

02:36.531 --> 02:38.658
-I know. I know.
-who is a sheriff.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.286
And it's just funny
because you're always telling me

02:41.369 --> 02:45.123
we won't survive it
if I act impulsive and--

02:45.206 --> 02:46.207
Honey?

02:47.333 --> 02:50.920
-So sweet, so gallant!
-Yeah.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.424
[instrumental theme music playing]

02:58.887 --> 03:01.598
Now lift his torso. I don't want him
leaving a stain on our floor.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.142
And knowing Dan,
he's gonna want to leave a stain.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.435
[sighs]

03:06.895 --> 03:09.188
Mmm. That coffee smells great.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.693
I love coffee. Think about it.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.112
It's a bean that you drink.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.115
-Are you high?
-No.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.327
I'm just feeling very grateful
about coffee.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.786
Now?

03:24.454 --> 03:28.041
Okay... we need to get Dan out of here
and into the storage unit.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.501
Right. But we can't drag him to the car
in broad daylight.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.502
No.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.047
If someone hadn't converted the garage
to a home office

03:34.130 --> 03:36.382
we could pull the car in,
load the body without anyone seeing.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.594
Well, someone uses that home office
as much as I do.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.429
I don't think someone does,
but let's drop it.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.932
-Fine, it's dropped. But they do.
-Fine.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.059
I'll go to the storage unit,
get the trunk and dolly,

03:46.142 --> 03:48.269
so we can load the body
and wheel it to the car,

03:48.353 --> 03:49.896
which will never again be in the garage.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.732
You really want to criticize
my decision-making

03:52.815 --> 03:55.360
in front of our neighbor
you just killed with a shovel?

03:56.653 --> 03:57.528
Yes.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.496
[sighs]

04:19.634 --> 04:23.263
Easy, easy.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.516
Would it be weird if I took his watch?
It'd be weird.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.519
-[flatulence]
-[groans]

04:29.602 --> 04:32.689
Gary did that too.
A dead woman would never do that.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.025
-Ooh! I can't believe you eat this.
-You eat meat.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.987
Even after we saw
that slaughterhouse documentary.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.240
I cut out veal and I limited bacon
to the weekends, that's all I can do.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.287
Okay, on three. One, two, three!

04:49.038 --> 04:50.290
[both] Shit.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.875
[knock on door]

04:52.959 --> 04:54.002
Shit!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.336
Let's not answer it.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.546
It's Rick.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.548
He knows we're home.
Our cars are out front.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.134
-Because we don't have a garage.
-Fuck you.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.679
-That's helpful.
-Guys, open up! I got news about Dan.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.016
How can there be news?
I just killed him an hour ago.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.768
Well, now if we don't open the door
we're really gonna look suspicious.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.979
Plus, we should see what he knows.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.482
Let's get him in the closet.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.862
Oh, I forgot. This is where we keep
all the stuff we used to keep--

05:20.945 --> 05:23.406
Yes, I'm sorry, there's no room
for the dead guy you came home with.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.492
Hey. Oh.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.163
Hey, Rick. You got some news about Dan?

05:30.246 --> 05:33.875
I was just coming back from a run and--
Are you guys all right? You look flushed.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.460
-We were fighting.
-We were having sex.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.755
We were having sex
and it turned into fighting.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.216
-He tried a move I didn't care for.
-Still learning.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.761
You said something about Dan
or something?

05:44.844 --> 05:47.555
You won't believe this.
I just ran into his partner outside.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.183
Apparently, she came to pick him up
for his shift this morning

05:50.266 --> 05:51.309
and he's missing.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.437
-Can I get some water?
-Oh! No, no, no. No!

05:54.520 --> 05:57.482
You may not. You are the guest.
We are the hosts.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.276
I will get some water, you stay here
with Joel and finish your story.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.652
Gentlemen.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.322
Thank you.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.407
So, what was the move?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.452
-You were talking about Dan.
-Right.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.581
So get this: his partner finds
the front door unlocked, but no Dan.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.084
His car's in the driveway,
his phone's on the coffee table,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.419
his mini breakfast quiche
is still in the microwave.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.713
[fart from corpse]

06:20.797 --> 06:22.965
So sorry about that. All me.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.052
I farted. I did that.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.806
So Dan's partner called it in,

06:29.889 --> 06:32.183
and now there's a couple of squad cars
looking around the neighborhood.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.769
Oh, I hope they find him
so I can give him shit

06:34.852 --> 06:37.063
about being too lazy
to bake a proper quiche.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.189
[nervous laugh]

06:43.736 --> 06:46.989
Ahh. Thanks for the water. I'll just--

06:47.698 --> 06:49.992
Mmmwah!

06:50.076 --> 06:51.702
You are so welcome!

06:54.956 --> 06:56.541
[Joel] Well, thanks for stopping by.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.585
You take it from here.

07:01.337 --> 07:05.216
Oh, by the way, that guy Anton
you were looking for?

07:05.299 --> 07:07.009
-I found his number.
-Really?

07:07.093 --> 07:08.511
[whispers] Tell me the move.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.013
You can't handle the move.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.768
-[door shuts]
-Oh, God.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.312
Fucking top-heavy Dan
and his narcing butthole.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.314
This is great.
Rick got that guy's number.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.525
-What guy?
-The guy with the Serbian book

07:22.608 --> 07:23.609
that might have a cure.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.361
-I'm gonna call him.
-Maybe tomorrow's project.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.572
-Right. Dan.
-What are we gonna do?

07:27.655 --> 07:30.366
We can't just take him out of here.
Now there's a sheriff next door.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.285
We can't leave him here.
Abby's gonna be home soon.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.538
Okay, we have to stash him somewhere,
somewhere Abby would never look.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.124
-A bookshelf?
-I was gonna say a dishwasher.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.293
Maybe in her trombone that cost us $600.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.503
Or under the paddleboard
she used four times.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.088
-Master bath.
-Good.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.424
She hasn't gone in there since
she walked in on us in the tub.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.551
-That was funny.
-[chuckles]

07:52.889 --> 07:56.309
That's a five-hour solution at best.
We need a plan.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.440
I've always loved it in here.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.902
The way the light comes in
and dances with the colors on the wall.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.740
This room isn't just a place
I have to use, it's a place I want to use.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.284
-[snaps fingers]
-Hey, buddy. Focus.

08:13.367 --> 08:16.579
All right? We're looking for a plan,
not a blurb for <i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>

08:18.289 --> 08:21.209
-Seriously, are you okay?
-Yeah, fine.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.878
We'll wait for the sheriffs to leave,
go get a new trunk,

08:23.961 --> 08:26.547
-and move him to the storage unit tonight.
-Yes.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.009
-[knock on door]
-[woman] County sheriff.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.552
-Motherfucker!
-Shit!

08:32.762 --> 08:34.138
Try not to kill this one.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.890
You've killed twice
as many people as I have.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.434
[mockingly muttering] ...as I have.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.312
Wow.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.273
So tomorrow, I'm going to the beach
with my parents.

08:44.982 --> 08:49.612
I'm actually looking forward to it.
There's this oyster truck we always go to.

08:49.695 --> 08:53.199
And the oysters are, like, okay,
but the guy gave me a beer once.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.034
Cool. Should we go get a coffee?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.370
I feel like we should stop
and get a coffee.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.748
You're nervous about going home
and seeing Dan, aren't you?

09:00.831 --> 09:03.209
When I left this morning,
he was going to plant his rosebushes

09:03.292 --> 09:06.254
so I'm pretty sure the flash bang went off
and it was a huge mistake

09:06.337 --> 09:09.215
and he's gonna kill me
and I want to try coffee before I die.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.175
Worst bucket list ever.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.220
It's going to be good, Eric.
It's gonna force a confrontation.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.638
Oh, I love those.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.684
Look, what I mean is,
what you have now obviously isn't working.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.854
Dan's a bully. If you don't stand up
to bullies, they just keep coming at you.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.899
And take it from me,
I was a monster in elementary school.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.736
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this will be a good thing.

09:30.820 --> 09:35.032
Maybe it'll make Dan realize, you mess
with this kitty cat, you get the claws.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.826
Great. How married are you
to that wording?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.495
He's gonna see I'm not gonna put up
with any more of his crap.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.955
-There you go.
-I'm gonna tell him,

09:41.038 --> 09:42.915
-"I'm not afraid of you, Dan."
-Perfect!

09:42.999 --> 09:46.502
"And if you've got a problem with me
watching Korean <i>StarCraft</i> tournaments

09:46.586 --> 09:48.879
instead of football,
you can just suck my..."

09:48.963 --> 09:51.173
I mean, maybe don't push it that far,
'cause sometimes with bullies--

09:51.257 --> 09:55.386
"dick! Suck my fucking dick, Dan."

09:57.179 --> 09:59.557
I'm sure you'll find it in the moment.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.979
Thank you. Anytime a sheriff's deputy
doesn't show up for work,

10:05.062 --> 10:06.522
we just wanna make sure
everything's all right.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.734
Oh... of course.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.821
-So either of you see Dan this morning?
-No. Wish I had. Great guy.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.575
-Wonderful guy. I can't get enough of him.
-[both chuckling]

10:17.658 --> 10:20.202
Interesting.
He's been my partner for five years

10:20.286 --> 10:23.122
and I've found that most people
just think he's unbelievably repellent.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.585
Well, we don't want to speak ill
of the... missing.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.797
-We love everyone, all of God's children.
-Amen to that.

10:31.881 --> 10:32.965
Mmm.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.426
You know, there is one thing
that strikes me as a little strange.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.427
What's that, Anne?

10:36.510 --> 10:40.014
You two are friends with the Palmers,
and you know Dan's missing,

10:40.097 --> 10:42.391
but you still haven't been over
to check on Lisa.

10:42.975 --> 10:48.230
-Is that strange or just inconsiderate?
-Inconsiderate. Mystery solved.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.567
You know, something like this
can be very stressful for the family,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.152
and Lisa is such a beautiful woman.

10:53.235 --> 10:57.531
-It would be great if you just came by.
-We definitely will.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.783
-Love it.
-Yeah.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.785
Is there anything else we can do to help?

11:00.868 --> 11:03.621
-Just pray that Dan's all right.
-Will do.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.707
Oh. Right now.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.587
Dear Lord,
I sit with some of your flock to ask--

11:11.671 --> 11:13.547
-[door opens, closes]
-[Abby] I'm home!

11:13.631 --> 11:15.299
We're in here, praying.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.717
[Abby] Ha-ha.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.220
-Shall I?
-Yes, please.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.723
Dear Lord,
I sit with some of your flock to ask--

11:22.807 --> 11:24.475
[Abby] Is there any Advil
in your bathroom?

11:24.558 --> 11:28.396
to ask for your help
in bringing Dan safely back to us.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.107
Lord, we love you--

11:31.190 --> 11:33.651
[Abby] Jesus fucking Christ!

11:34.151 --> 11:38.739
Honey, I'll be right there.
I'm just down here with the sheriff!

11:38.823 --> 11:39.949
[chuckles]

11:40.950 --> 11:43.786
Can you arrest a 16-year-old
for having a foul mouth?

11:43.869 --> 11:48.124
Teenagers. Can't live with them,
can live without them.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.129
[laughing]

11:54.255 --> 11:58.592
-That should totally be a T-shirt.
-What a funny sheriff.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.469
[clears throat] Dear Lord...

12:06.642 --> 12:07.476
Is the sheriff gone?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.895
-[softly] Yeah.
-Yes.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.066
You guys don't let me see
<i>The Godfather </i>until I'm 15,

12:14.150 --> 12:17.820
but you fucking kill Dan and leave him
in the bathtub for me to find?

12:21.198 --> 12:23.576
I am so sorry that you had to see that.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.036
He was blackmailing us, honey,
and threatening our family.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.163
I had no choice.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.709
Wait. You killed him?

12:33.043 --> 12:36.213
Yes. Men can kill, too.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.258
Did you also kill the frozen guy
in the storage unit?

12:39.341 --> 12:41.010
-You know about that?
-Yeah.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.221
And I've seen your blender
and I know what's in your smoothies.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.475
Look, you need to kill
and eat people, I get that.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.811
But here's what I need:
no more lying to me.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.148
We were just trying to protect you
from the truth

12:54.231 --> 12:56.901
because we want our family
to be as normal as possible.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.403
You think this family
is ever gonna be normal?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.738
We want to be, honey.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.907
That's why we're going
to the beach tomorrow,

13:02.990 --> 13:05.451
although now we're probably
not going to the beach tomorrow.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.330
Right, because you killed our neighbor.
So, what's the plan?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.416
Are we gonna keep him?
Do I finally get a brother?

13:12.500 --> 13:15.461
We have a plan,
but I feel like in your current state

13:15.544 --> 13:17.171
you're gonna judge it negatively.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.675
You guys are not great at this,
and if you don't get your act together

13:21.759 --> 13:24.720
we will never go to the beach
because you will be in jail.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.849
And I'm tired of walking in on weird shit
going on in your bathtub.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.604
We really lost the moral high ground
on that one.

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
Yup.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.484
[door opens]

13:41.320 --> 13:42.947
Hey. I just came to see
how you're doing.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.406
Look! The flash bang went off.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.993
Dan knows I'm the only one who
could've put it there. He's not missing.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.496
He's laying low, plotting how to kill me
and get away with it.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.874
Something people would believe,
like... like a reading accident.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.044
-Eric, breathe.
-Oh, my God, I'm not breathing.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.297
-Oh, my God, I forgot how.
-Eric, listen to me.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.508
-[exhales]
-What if I told you...

14:03.217 --> 14:06.262
that you never had
to worry about Dan ever again?

14:07.221 --> 14:11.517
What? Why not?
Ab-- Abby, do you know something?

14:12.518 --> 14:16.605
He's in our bathtub, dead.
My parents killed him.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.904
[exhales]

14:25.531 --> 14:26.782
Can I see him?

14:29.660 --> 14:30.661
Hello?

14:33.163 --> 14:34.582
Whoa.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.668
[indistinct police radio chatter]

14:38.794 --> 14:41.547
Jesus, that's a lot of cops.

14:41.630 --> 14:45.050
Oh, you came. Didn't bring any food.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.470
We've already established
we're inconsiderate people.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.348
Yes. Uh, I'll tell Lisa you're here.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.851
[exhales]

14:54.393 --> 14:55.394
Look at them.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.440
All rugged individuals,
yet working together.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.985
In another time,
they would've been cowboys.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.615
What is going on with you?
And don't just say you're okay.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.035
I don't know. I see things
I feel are true and I share them.

15:11.118 --> 15:14.330
I've noticed. And I'm worried about you.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.459
Hi. Thank you so much for coming over.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.463
-How are you?
-I'm fine. I'm sure Dan is fine.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.049
He's probably just in the desert
shooting owls,

15:25.132 --> 15:26.342
or at the beach shooting starfish,

15:26.425 --> 15:29.219
or maybe at that strip club
that has the bacon he likes.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.846
He's a man of many interests.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.184
I guess.
Sheila, can you help me in the kitchen?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.102
Anne has been so useful,

15:37.186 --> 15:39.605
but she cannot julienne a carrot
to save her life,

15:39.688 --> 15:43.817
even with those delicate,
perfect fingers of hers. [chuckles]

15:44.735 --> 15:46.445
Known her for five years,
and this pretty lady

15:46.528 --> 15:48.280
still makes me blush about my fingers.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.241
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
such perfect fingers

15:51.325 --> 15:53.535
and then people wouldn't talk about them.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.287
What am I gonna do with you?

15:56.372 --> 15:58.248
[Lisa] Oh, stop it.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.708
Come on.

16:00.584 --> 16:04.630
-I'll be right back. Are you good?
-I'm good. Good, good.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.677
Dan's probably fine.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.137
I asked some of the boys
to go to that strip club.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.305
Had a lot of volunteers.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.434
[nervous chuckle]
Sure, naked women...

16:18.227 --> 16:19.687
supporting their kids.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.737
Oh, that's from a trip to Maui
the four of us took a couple of years ago.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.115
It's so beautiful.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.909
[Anne] We went to a luau.
Cooked a pig right in the dirt.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.996
Dan took the snout, put it on his nose
and said a bunch of racist stuff.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.122
It was not cool.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.874
But, you know, we let it slide
because it was a vacation, so...

16:41.959 --> 16:43.961
-[waves crashing, faint]
-We ate that pork, it was so good.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.755
You wouldn't think meat
cooked in the dirt could be that good.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.340
[seagulls cawing, faint]

16:48.424 --> 16:51.593
-[Anne talking, indistinct]
-[children laugh and shout, faint]

16:51.677 --> 16:54.805
...a pod of dolphins
swimming right in front of us.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.266
Whoa, what's going on, Joel?

16:57.349 --> 16:58.600
[sniffles]

16:59.351 --> 17:01.895
-Sorry.
-Something you wanna talk about?

17:01.979 --> 17:03.856
What's up, guys?

17:03.939 --> 17:07.359
I was telling Joel about Dan and Hawaii,

17:07.443 --> 17:08.819
-and then he started crying.
-Yeah.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.279
Why are you crying, Joel?

17:13.490 --> 17:18.454
Joel really looks up to Dan.
Dan's sort of like a father figure to him.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.749
And now that he's missing, it's brought up
a lot of abandonment issues.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.834
Did your father leave?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.630
-Nope.
-It's also brought up some denial issues.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.179
Don't worry, Joel.
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.307
We're gonna have guys in the neighborhood
all night keeping an eye out.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.018
If Dan doesn't turn up by tomorrow,
we'll bring in some dogs to help.

17:41.602 --> 17:45.189
Oh, you mean like therapy dogs
to cheer up Lisa?

17:45.272 --> 17:47.441
No, search dogs.
They can find a rubber glove

17:47.524 --> 17:48.525
buried ten feet underground.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.277
If Dan's anywhere around here,
they'll find him.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.612
Fucking dogs!

17:52.654 --> 17:56.742
-They're the greatest.
-Oh, they really are.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.995
<i>We</i> should be licking <i>them.</i>

18:00.829 --> 18:01.955
Maybe?

18:08.003 --> 18:10.756
He was threatening my parents,
he was gonna turn them in.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.258
Eric?

18:14.510 --> 18:19.098
You were right about one thing, Dan.
I won't be having sex in your lifetime.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.768
-Whoa, coming in hot.
-He was such a jerk to my mom.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.646
And this is probably the most quality time
he's ever spent with me.

18:25.729 --> 18:29.066
I'm just sorry I never got a chance
to let him know how I feel.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.194
You could tell him now.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.114
I don't think he's going anywhere.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.367
[sighs]

18:38.951 --> 18:41.328
There was never a moment
I wasn't scared of you.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.831
But when I see you like this...

18:44.832 --> 18:48.168
I realize you're just a small, sad man.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.880
And who knows,
maybe you treated me so badly

18:51.964 --> 18:54.216
because someone else
did the same thing to you.

18:55.008 --> 18:55.884
Wow.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.886
-That's really sweet.
-I'm not done.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.638
Still...

19:00.764 --> 19:01.932
you can suck my dick.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.978
That would only be like the third
worst thing I've seen in this bathtub.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.189
So, I think I know the answer,
but I've got to ask.

19:10.232 --> 19:14.653
-Are you gonna tell on my parents?
-No way. I like your parents.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.780
Besides, if they go to jail,
you'll move away

19:16.864 --> 19:18.949
and then you'll miss me
and I don't want that for you.

19:19.032 --> 19:23.120
Right. So I have a plan
that might keep that from happening.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.622
-I just need one thing.
-Anything. Name it.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.709
Whatever it is, I'll get it for you.
If I can't, I'll make it for you.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.753
-A flashlight.
-Mine's broken.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.838
Honestly.

19:35.215 --> 19:39.094
Okay, today has obviously been intense
and it's taking a toll on you.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.220
We don't have time for this.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.931
We have to get the body out of here
by morning or the dogs will find it.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.393
Honey, I just saw you stare
at a picture of a beach and start crying.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.228
We got married on a beach
and you didn't cry.

19:48.312 --> 19:52.441
I need you to let me take some
of the weight off your shoulders.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.444
Like about... 200 pounds.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.990
It's impossible.
You can't eat this much in one night.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.201
-It's the only way.
-[sighs]

20:02.284 --> 20:04.536

they'll never look.

as a very long face with toes.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.235
Thank you.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.781

I can't finish him.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.196
The dogs will be here pretty soon.

22:03.905 --> 22:07.909
-We're going to jail and it's my fault.
-How is it your fault? I killed Dan.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.079
I brought death into this house.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.832
I'm the one
that made killing seem normal.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.917
And it is so not normal, Joel.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.836
The way you've been acting today?

22:19.504 --> 22:20.714
I broke you.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.134
I'm so sorry.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.640
No. You're not the one
who needs to apologize.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.356
[sighing]

22:37.939 --> 22:39.483
I'm sorry, dude.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.111
Jesus, I killed you
and I'm saying, "Sorry, dude,"

this morning.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.914
I've been appreciating a lot of things
these past 24 hours.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.334
Maybe 'cause I've realized...

22:57.959 --> 23:02.255
you never know when your neighbor
might kill you with a shovel.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.967
But I don't have to tell half of you that.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.806
I guess what I mean by "sorry, dude" is...

I'm sorry you're never gonna enjoy

24:09.114 --> 24:10.115
Going to the beach?

24:11.658 --> 24:13.201
-That's right.
-It's a family day.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.453
I wish there was more we could do
to help with Dan.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.582
[burps] But we'll be thinking about him.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.668
Oh, let me get that for you.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.673
[dogs barking, muffled]

24:34.639 --> 24:36.516
Mind if I grab a soda?

24:36.600 --> 24:40.478
Sorry, we don't drink sodas
in this family, only milk.

24:42.022 --> 24:46.860
-You're bringing milk to the beach?
-Well, they don't have it there.

24:48.737 --> 24:52.365
Hey! We found something.
It's in the garage.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.457
-What do you think they found?
-A guy like Dan? Could be anything.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.666
Shall we?

25:04.544 --> 25:05.921
You're right.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.882
This whole thing would have been easier
with a garage.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.594
Maybe.
But I kinda like having a home office.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.184
Hey, murderers, let's go to the beach.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.854
-I really need a beer.
-[seatbelts clicking]

26:00.141 --> 26:02.102
Dan was into all kinds of shit.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.354
They found drugs, money, weapons,

26:04.437 --> 26:07.107
even a finger that belonged to that guy
who went missing from your office.

26:08.024 --> 26:11.569
-Gary? They think Dan killed Gary?
-[Rick] They don't have a motive yet,

26:11.653 --> 26:14.990
but having the guy's finger
makes Dan pretty suspicious.

26:15.073 --> 26:18.785
They did some digging,
found out Dan was also connected

26:18.868 --> 26:22.414
to some gangster named Loki,
who turns out was blackmailing him.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.457
And now Loki is missing too.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.962
[wings buzzing]

26:29.045 --> 26:32.424
They think Dan was stashing his stuff
when someone came to grab him.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.385
Happened so fast,
he didn't even turn off his flashlight.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.265
-Life is amazing.
-I know.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.143
This is the best goddamn day ever.
[chuckles]

26:43.226 --> 26:45.186
We should get high
and go to Magic Mountain.

[moans]

27:02.746 --> 27:05.332
[sighs] We really do have
to get better at this.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.887
Oh, fuck.
