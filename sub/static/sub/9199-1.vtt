WEBVTT

00:42.251 --> 00:44.168
Eva, we've got to go now!

00:44.336 --> 00:46.337
Now, now!

00:48.048 --> 00:50.633
Come on, Eva!

00:50.801 --> 00:53.052
Come on, hurry!

00:53.220 --> 00:56.514
Come on, run!
Eva, come on!

01:01.437 --> 01:02.812
Come on, Eva.
We don't have time.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.480
We don't have time.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.654
- Come on, Eva!
- Get out the door!

01:13.532 --> 01:16.159
- Run!
- Eva!

01:18.996 --> 01:22.123
Go, go, go, go!

01:25.502 --> 01:27.336
Mommy!

01:29.173 --> 01:31.507
Get back!
Go on, go!

01:37.681 --> 01:39.682
Hold on to me.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.581
Let there be light.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.965
Yeah.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.102
Not exactly the Garden of Eden.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.157
After a blast,
everything gets vaporized

05:25.325 --> 05:28.786
and sucked up
into the atmosphere.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.124
And it rains back down to earth...

05:36.420 --> 05:39.213
as radioactive dust.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.093
Number one rule:

05:44.261 --> 05:46.429
no one opens that door

05:46.596 --> 05:48.806
till the radiation clears.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.143
You understand me?

05:54.396 --> 05:58.441
You want to survive,
you listen to me.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.171
Jesus!

06:28.555 --> 06:30.014
Someone get the lights!

06:30.182 --> 06:32.683
You okay? You okay?

06:32.851 --> 06:35.561
- Someone get the lights!
- Calm down. Calm down.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.481
Don't touch that.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.621
Holy shit, it's the dust!
lt's the dust!

06:53.789 --> 06:57.500
That dust is from the inside.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
The bitch is sealed tight.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.545
What was that?
Another bomb?

07:01.713 --> 07:04.090
That was our building
coming down.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.299
How the fuck
do you know that?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.968
l don't want to be down here.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.804
l want to go now.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.764
l know, sweetie.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.475
But Uncle Mickey says
we have to stay.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.269
- Why?
- Because your face will melt off

07:17.437 --> 07:19.146
and your hair will fall out.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.732
She's a little girl.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.944
l was just fucking around.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.906
- So that was a nuke?
- Definitely.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.908
Fucking rag-heads.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.661
- We got to stay down here?
- Bet your ass we do.

07:33.829 --> 07:37.289
That door stays sealed
until the radiation clears.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.958
And how long's that gonna take?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.210
When l say.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.757
What's the plan, Mickey?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.802
Well, my plan was to build
a fallout shelter

07:49.970 --> 07:53.556
and take it easy while my 
pain-in-the-ass tenants

07:53.723 --> 07:56.142
barbecued above me.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.394
Does anybody's cell phones work?

07:58.562 --> 08:01.021
No, there's no signal.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.982
- l fucking lost mine.
- You lost it?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.693
ls that a radio?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.237
Give it a try.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.030
Cocksucking jack-off.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.283
Hello?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.326
Hello? Hello?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.787
Hello, do you copy?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.795
What's down here?

08:36.433 --> 08:39.727
As you see, just a bunch
of storage cells full of junk.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.606
Hey, uh...

08:43.773 --> 08:45.858
uh, it's Mickey, right?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.568
Yeah.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.862
Why do you have
so many mattresses?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.991
Because l'm the super of a 
goddamn apartment building.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.746
So why do you have
so many mattresses?

08:58.914 --> 09:00.581
What the fuck do you care?

09:00.749 --> 09:02.666
l sell them on the lnternet.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.047
Turkish bath in here.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.799
Sorry, ladies, no running water
to wash your panties.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.511
Toilet's on the left.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.681
lt's septic,
so after you finish,

09:17.849 --> 09:20.726
throw some lime on top of it.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.730
That's fucking disgusting.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.483
lt's called saving water.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.277
Sure, whatever.
l've got to take a dump.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.909
What's in here?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.871
That's my room.
Nobody goes in there but me.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.499
Mama, l'm hungry.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.921
Uh, Mickey...

09:49.089 --> 09:50.714
do you have anything to eat?

10:05.689 --> 10:08.357
The food is adequate, l hope.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.901
Don't thank me all at once.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.196
No, the food's good.
Thanks, Mickey.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.871
Hello?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.961
Hello? Hello?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.881
Anybody there?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.383
Hello?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.261
Shut up back there.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.680
Hello?

10:39.848 --> 10:42.057
We have survivors

10:42.225 --> 10:44.977
in a building on 
the northwest corner

10:45.145 --> 10:46.645
of 29th and 5th.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.400
l repeat, the northwest corner
of 29th and 5th.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.485
Do you copy?

11:00.243 --> 11:01.994
Do you really have 
to smoke that thing?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.246
l mean, there's already
so much dust in here.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.086
So when can we go up?

11:11.254 --> 11:13.589
When l say so.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.092
Fuck it.
Ade, come on, let's go.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.511
Adrien, come on.
Bobby, let's go. We're out of here.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.056
Let's go. Fuck it.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.767
What do you think you're doing?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.394
Get away from the door.
l won't tell you again.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.189
- l told you!
- Josh!

11:31.983 --> 11:33.942
- Look out!
- Get away from the fucking door!

11:34.110 --> 11:36.779
- Get away from the goddamn door!
- Come on!

11:36.946 --> 11:39.406
Go ahead.
Shit!

11:39.574 --> 11:42.201
What the fuck, Mickey?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.286
God damn it.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.705
Fucking...

11:49.459 --> 11:52.461
Fucking big man with that ax, huh?
Keep pushing me, Mickey.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.129
Keep fucking pushing me,
you're gonna see what happens.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.388
Ever see what happened to
those poor Japanese bastards...

12:04.974 --> 12:07.518
after we dropped
Little Boy on Nagasaki?

12:07.685 --> 12:11.021
The skin melting off their bones.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.566
Faces like roadkill.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.152
Lucky ones died in the blast.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.780
And those kids in Chernobyl--

12:19.948 --> 12:23.867
eyes and... ears.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.995
Shit growing all over 'em.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.373
Tumors the size of grapefruits

12:29.541 --> 12:31.708
popping out of their necks.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.128
Enough, Mickey.
We get it.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.838
What you need to get

12:36.005 --> 12:40.467
is if that dust gets in here,
we're all fucked.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.187
Hope not.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.621
Come here, honey.
Let me braid your hair.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.681
Can l borrow that, please?

14:50.848 --> 14:53.433
Of course.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.561
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.155
You kept it.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.451
Of course l did.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.204
Eva,

15:14.372 --> 15:17.583
l'm sorry if l've been acting
a little bit nuts.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.793
l'm just trying, you know,

15:19.961 --> 15:21.837
to keep it together.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.089
l guess that's what survival is,

15:24.257 --> 15:27.092
just trying to keep it together.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.553
But l love you.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.305
And you love me.

15:31.472 --> 15:35.309
And that's what's going to pull 
us through this nightmare.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.936
lt'll make us better parents.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.070
Eva.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.034
- Eva.
- What?

16:02.754 --> 16:05.547
Come on, honey.
Just one more bite.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.507
l want to go home.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.052
Do you want me to try
and warm them up for you?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.561
We are going to die, aren't we?

16:19.729 --> 16:22.481
No, honey, we're not going to die.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.900
We're going to live.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.736
Let's just do our meditation, okay?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.488
Shut your eyes.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.115
Really picture the beautiful light
and how good it makes us feel.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.660
Let's do that right now, okay?
Come on.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.371
- Shut your eyes.
- lt doesn't work.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.624
- lt does work.
- l want to go home.

16:40.792 --> 16:45.504
Wendy, you just have
to be patient, okay?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.131
And then it'll get better outside.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.634
And then somebody'll come down
and they'll help us.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.428
- Promise?
- Promise.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.181
Thank you.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.817
Gonna have to eat this shit
every day?

17:06.983 --> 17:08.276
What'd you say?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.780
What?

17:13.074 --> 17:15.701
l give you food,

17:15.867 --> 17:19.496
shelter, and that's what you say?

17:20.790 --> 17:25.042
Fuckers come down here,
expect me to take care of you.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.296
What do you contribute?
What'd you bring to the fucking party?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.382
Take it easy, Mickey.

17:30.550 --> 17:35.178
All my family and friends
are probably dead,

17:35.346 --> 17:39.057
and all you can talk about
are fucking beans?

17:41.811 --> 17:43.437
Come on, Mick!

17:43.604 --> 17:47.149
Are we really supposed
to rely on this guy?

17:47.316 --> 17:48.817
- Sam.
- No, no, no, no, really, really.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.361
How long can you keep us
alive in this-- in this--

17:51.529 --> 17:53.572
- Shit hole.
- Yes, exactly.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.824
You know what?
This is a fucking shit hole, man.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.033
Calm down. Sam--

17:57.201 --> 17:58.827
No. No, l'm sorry.
l won't stop.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.996
- Stop.
- l won't stop because l want someone

18:01.164 --> 18:02.998
to do something, that's all.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.792
- l need someone to do something.
- Sam, calm down.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.878
- No, l won't calm down because l--
- Sam.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.046
Sam, please stop.
Stop!

18:10.214 --> 18:13.341
- Do something, man. Come on!
- Sam, please stop.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.844
lnstead ofjust sitting around
waiting to fucking die.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.352
Don't be scared, Wendy.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.899
Uncle Mickey only slaps little girls.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.527
And you're a big girl, aren't you?
Want to see a magic trick?

18:32.695 --> 18:35.363
l'm gonna take my thumb off
for you, all right?

18:37.408 --> 18:40.202
Yeeow!
God, that hurts.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.413
Seen that one before?

18:43.581 --> 18:46.124
Okay, let me think
of another one.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.544
Making your cigar disappear?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.061
Oh, shit.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.396
Shit.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.446
lt's a rescue.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.080
Down here!
Down here!

19:32.380 --> 19:34.464
- Cut the lights.
- What the hell for?

19:34.632 --> 19:36.800
Just do it.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.718
You guys, what's going on up there?

21:03.137 --> 21:04.888
Hey, okay,
we're civilians, all right?

21:05.056 --> 21:07.599
Okay, we're all
on the same side, right?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.684
Whoa, what are you doing?

21:09.852 --> 21:12.354
Didn't you hear him?

21:24.951 --> 21:28.036
Mommy!

21:28.204 --> 21:30.914
Help me!
No!

21:34.877 --> 21:37.879
- No!
- Help me!

21:44.053 --> 21:45.345
Wendy!

21:52.269 --> 21:54.354
No, no!

21:58.234 --> 22:00.235
No! No!

22:02.238 --> 22:03.989
No!

22:04.156 --> 22:07.033
Get back.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.250
Go, go, go! Run!

22:18.421 --> 22:20.171
God!

23:25.988 --> 23:28.364
We've got another 2-8-Baker.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.874
Give me the lock!
Give me the lock!

25:01.041 --> 25:03.459
- What lock?
- Get me the chain!

25:04.628 --> 25:07.297
- l don't need your help.
- Get out of the way.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.175
Come on, come on.
Put the chain on there.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.302
- Mickey!
- Hey, Mickey!

25:12.469 --> 25:14.554
l need some help.
Adrien got shot.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.098
- Put him down over here.
- What? Okay.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.809
Whoa, whoa.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.520
Hey, somebody fucking
get something. He got shot!

25:22.688 --> 25:25.440
Oh, shit.

25:25.608 --> 25:28.985
l got to look.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.404
Oh, shit, Bobby.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.323
- What the fuck?
- Somebody get a medical kit.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.577
Thank you.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.497
- l got it. l got it.
- l don't know what to do.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.292
- l got it. l got it.
- There's nothing here that's usable.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.003
lt's all from, like,
1984 or something.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.088
- You gotta take the bullet out, right?
- lt's gonna sting, okay?

25:49.256 --> 25:51.007
All right.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.718
- Oh, fuck!
- Sorry.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.387
- You're gonna be okay, man.
- He's gonna die.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.389
- He's fine.
- He's gonna fucking die.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.851
Shut up!
He's not gonna fucking die.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.478
What do you want me to do?

26:03.646 --> 26:06.564
lt's gonna be all right.
lt's gonna be all right, all right?

26:06.732 --> 26:08.358
- Arch your back. Just lean a bit.
- Come on.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.361
- Almost got it.
- Almost? He's gonna be all right?

26:11.528 --> 26:13.029
- So he's gonna be okay?
- He's gonna be okay.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.906
You're lucky it didn't hit
the artery.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.699
- He's gonna be okay.
- Okay, you got to clean that out.

26:16.867 --> 26:17.992
l got it. Thank you.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.953
Come over here.
Come over here.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.080
Okay?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.165
Put your hand on the back there.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.125
Press hard on the front,
keep your hands on the back.

26:26.293 --> 26:29.128
- That's fine. That's good.
- Yeah.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.839
Just like that.
He'll be all right.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.678
Where's Sam?

26:36.845 --> 26:38.763
- Hold this.
- Yeah, l'm here.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.016
- Hold this as hard as you can.
- l'm here. l'm here. l got it.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.857
Sam. Sam.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.866
You okay?
You hurt?

27:02.204 --> 27:04.539
You're alive.

27:04.707 --> 27:08.459
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?

27:12.548 --> 27:14.424
l'm okay.

27:43.746 --> 27:47.081
Looks like some sort
of biohazard suit.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.167
lt's a radiation suit.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.837
Bet we got hit by one of those loose
nukes l've been reading about.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.673
lt's just a matter of time
before one of them hajis

27:55.841 --> 27:57.592
got their hands on one of them.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.053
So you're saying it's the Arabs?

28:00.220 --> 28:02.472
Of course they're Arabs.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.932
They've been at war
with us for 20 years.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.518
lt's just that we've been too busy

28:07.686 --> 28:10.271
stuffing ourselves
at the trough to notice.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.857
We should have wiped them
off the map when we had the chance.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.817
Now it's probably too fucking late.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.783
Oh, shit.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.788
Okay, that's disgusting.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.842
Let me guess, North Koreans.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.554
- You're a fucking idiot.
- Get out of here.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.473
Oh, fuck!

28:47.976 --> 28:49.977
Holy shit.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.648
Grab the tape.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.111
l got her.
All right. Okay.

28:58.278 --> 29:01.155
l got her. Ow!

29:01.323 --> 29:03.324
All right, all right.
Take it easy.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.493
Grab her arms.

29:07.913 --> 29:11.165
Put her in the storage room.
Come on.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.505
Get the door.
Get the door.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.509
No!

29:44.908 --> 29:47.201
Top rations.
Mickey's orders.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.496
l'm fine. You take it.
You take it.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.294
Can you make anything out?

29:56.462 --> 29:59.380
Only thing l caught was something
about finishing up the sweep.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.050
And they're American accents.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.097
Turn off the fucking radio, man.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.183
That's what got us in trouble
in the first place.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.858
Hey, Mickey,nwhat is 
that in your pocket?

30:23.280 --> 30:26.157
Whether it's making
a damn fine sausage

30:26.325 --> 30:29.744
or exterminating
an entire race of people,

30:29.912 --> 30:32.163
those Germans
don't fuck around.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.248
You're holding out food
on us now?

30:34.416 --> 30:36.501
l got a couple of bits and pieces
in my room.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.504
lt's my place.
lt's my right.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.256
- Just go back to your room.
- Damn it!

30:51.058 --> 30:52.600
Has anyone fed Marilyn?

30:54.561 --> 30:56.938
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Don't waste that.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.774
What's so funny?

31:01.568 --> 31:02.777
What?

31:02.945 --> 31:04.946
What's so funny?

31:05.113 --> 31:07.281
Oh, nothing.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.534
Just what you said
and how you said it.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.787
"Has anyone fed Marilyn yet?"
Like she's your fucking dog.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.252
He gets it.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.046
Show some respect.
She just lost her kid.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.965
Go back to sleep, Adrien.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.139
Where are you going?

31:32.307 --> 31:34.600
Where are you going?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.981
She's pissed.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.943
You've got something on your face.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.656
Other side.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.702
That's it.

32:10.387 --> 32:19.770
She's all that's good in me.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.565
l'm sorry.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.847
- Too risky.
- What do you mean it's too risky?

32:55.015 --> 32:56.515
Eva: Whatever's in the air outside,
it's in here.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.434
Your goddamn duct tape
won't make any difference.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.269
At least we can find out
what's going on out there

33:00.437 --> 33:01.812
even if we don't find her kid.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.440
- You're volunteering?
- l'm volunteering.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.567
He's volunteering.
l say if he wants to go, let him go.

33:06.735 --> 33:10.071
- Let me go. Come on.
- l don't trust you coming back.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.864
What is your problem with me?

33:12.032 --> 33:14.283
- He's got a problem with everybody.
- What about Josh?

33:14.451 --> 33:15.910
- No. Fuck, no.
- Me?

33:16.078 --> 33:17.411
- What about Josh?
- You want me to go?

33:17.579 --> 33:19.955
He ain't got the brains
and that faggot ain't got the balls.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.375
- He'll come back for his brother.
- Thanks, Mickey.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.959
l'll go.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.170
No, no, no, Eva.
Eva, you can't be serious.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.756
- l'll go.
- Don't be stupid.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.758
- l'll go.
- Delvin: You happy, Mick?

33:30.926 --> 33:32.843
You a punk. You know that?
You a punk.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.055
When you ain't got no ax in your hand,
then you got something to say.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.435
l don't think he's gonna like
what he finds out there.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.939
At least we have to try.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.287
Glove.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.464
- How's your tube?
- Tube is good.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.757
Excuse me.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.927
Do you have air?
ls it working?

34:15.094 --> 34:17.763
- You got one more to go.
- ls the compressor gonna work?

34:17.931 --> 34:20.349
- Yeah, it's fine.
- There it is.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.145
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.813
Let's go.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.029
Promise me you'll bring her back.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.576
l'll do my best.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.250
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's do it. Let's go.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.514
Let's do it.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.196
What the hell is that?

35:24.289 --> 35:26.040
Hey, Josh.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.126
Don't worry, man.
l-- l got this.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.816
Wendy.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.031
Hold it.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.352
Go.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.276
Hey, it's okay.
lt's okay.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.487
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What did you see?

38:43.655 --> 38:45.406
- You're okay.
- l think l got two of 'em.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.907
- What did you see?
- Where's your gun?

38:47.075 --> 38:49.702
They got this-- this lab set up there.
lt's like-- it's like--

38:49.869 --> 38:52.496
- Josh, what else?
- Like what?

38:52.664 --> 38:54.248
- What else?
- What do you mean what else?

38:54.416 --> 38:56.250
That's it.
There's no survivors.

38:56.418 --> 38:59.003
There's no other civilians.
There's no fucking Red Cross.

39:00.714 --> 39:04.591
l don't know if they're army.
l don't even know if they're American.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.951
l'm sorry.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.594
They're coming back.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.304
No.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.682
They're welding us in.

42:20.580 --> 42:23.790
- How are you holding up?
- Uh, l'll live.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.627
Delvin gave me his pain meds.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.962
Mind if l take a look?

42:31.257 --> 42:33.300
l just want to clean it.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.889
You know it's gonna sting a little.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.516
Sorry.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.898
You a nurse or something?

42:49.150 --> 42:51.026
No.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.820
You're just gonna have
a nasty scar.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.698
Yeah, well,
chicks dig scars, right?

43:04.874 --> 43:07.292
You lived below us, right?

43:07.460 --> 43:09.169
Yep.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.046
Was that you who played guitar?

43:11.214 --> 43:13.757
Yeah. Did that annoy you?

43:13.925 --> 43:15.842
No.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.262
No, l actually really liked it.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.681
Helped me sleep sometimes.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.851
lt keeps most people awake.

43:28.189 --> 43:30.065
Not me.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.582
ls everything all right?

43:47.750 --> 43:50.627
Yeah. Everything's fine.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.401
Ugh, how can you
eat with that smell?

44:14.569 --> 44:15.902
We've got to get rid
of those bodies.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.863
How, exactly?

44:18.031 --> 44:21.158
Chop 'em up,
toss 'em down the septic.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.785
Should have tried harder
to get that door open.

44:23.953 --> 44:27.789
That door is welded shut.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.335
We should have put the bodies out
when Josh went out.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.046
Shame we let
those bodies go rotten.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.589
What do you mean?

44:35.757 --> 44:39.134
You ever heard about that rugby team
that survived the Andes?

44:39.302 --> 44:40.927
Their plane crashed.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.013
They were forced to eat
their friends and family.

44:43.181 --> 44:44.973
They survived up there
for months.

44:45.141 --> 44:46.433
They ate everything--

44:46.601 --> 44:50.520
ears, toes, assholes.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.940
Uh-huh, arms, legs,
brains, the spleen.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.443
The only thing they didn't \
at was the penis.

44:56.611 --> 45:00.113
lf worse comes to worst, you all have
full permission to eat my body.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.991
Yeah, you do.
But not my penis.

45:03.159 --> 45:06.119
Nobody-- nobody but nobody

45:06.287 --> 45:09.122
eats Bobby's penis.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.253
What's that for, Mickey?

45:19.717 --> 45:22.469
Uh-uh.

45:25.181 --> 45:26.807
Delvin?

45:33.314 --> 45:35.190
Well, yeah.

45:37.527 --> 45:39.194
Fuck, yeah.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.655
Yeah, l'll do it.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.866
Come on.

46:18.401 --> 46:20.694
l can do this, man.
l got this.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.119
But can he live with it?

46:36.377 --> 46:38.879
- Hey, Bobby?
- l got this, man.

46:39.046 --> 46:42.674
Yeah, l'll be... fine.

46:55.897 --> 46:57.856
lt's just like cutting lumber.

46:58.024 --> 46:59.941
l'll start with the arms.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.990
l'll just get my swing down.

47:13.414 --> 47:16.750
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

47:16.918 --> 47:20.754
Chop a body from head to toe.

48:39.375 --> 48:41.501
lt's blunt.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.978
Man, what you doing in here?

51:05.146 --> 51:06.855
What?

51:07.022 --> 51:08.440
How did you get in here, man?
l heard you.

51:08.607 --> 51:10.191
- When did you come in here?
- Fuck off.

51:10.359 --> 51:13.445
How did you get in here?
What you got in your pocket?

51:14.822 --> 51:16.823
Punk.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.961
l was dreaming about Mom.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.715
You think she's okay?

51:33.883 --> 51:35.925
l don't care.

51:36.093 --> 51:38.720
She's your mom.
She's not mine.

51:38.888 --> 51:42.390
Just 'cause she cut
my sandwiches...

51:50.232 --> 51:52.901
- Hey, Adrien.
- Yeah?

51:54.320 --> 51:57.739
l only went out there to see
if there's a way out for us.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.293
Hey, was Mickey an aviator
or something?

52:52.461 --> 52:54.587
Look at these.

52:54.755 --> 52:56.965
What the hell's going on in here?

52:58.843 --> 53:01.135
Come on, Mickey, we're just looking
for some escapism, all right?

53:01.303 --> 53:04.681
l told you from day one
that this was my room

53:04.849 --> 53:06.474
and you were to stay out.

53:06.642 --> 53:10.395
Your casa is our casa now.

53:11.814 --> 53:15.483
l don't know what
you're talking about,

53:15.651 --> 53:18.236
but you're gonna regret this.

53:18.404 --> 53:20.154
This is my ball.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.323
You got it out of my apartment?

53:22.491 --> 53:25.201
- l got it out of your ass.
- You got it out of my apartment.

53:26.787 --> 53:28.788
Hey, he's got forks.

53:30.583 --> 53:32.625
- Adrien.
- l've been looking for this ball.

53:32.793 --> 53:34.335
Don't need to use
your dirty fingers any-- hey!

53:34.503 --> 53:37.714
- This is a very valuable ball.
- You got it fixed.

53:39.675 --> 53:43.469
Hit down here, come this way,
and jab real hard

53:43.637 --> 53:45.597
and start firing like this.

53:45.764 --> 53:48.224
Now if they're behind you
and they have a gun behind you...

53:48.392 --> 53:51.102
- This is amazing.
- ...what you want to do is feel that tip.

53:51.270 --> 53:53.897
Once you feel it,
come to the outside.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.940
The gun will discharge this way.

53:56.108 --> 53:58.192
Take your arm,
take both their hands,

53:58.360 --> 54:01.613
pull with this hand, and go forward
and you'll take the gun away.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.990
All right, soldier,
fight safe

54:04.158 --> 54:06.367
and come back
to the United States.

54:45.157 --> 54:47.867
- Oh, another one?
- Mm-hmm.

54:48.035 --> 54:50.411
- Where the hell did you get that one?
- lt's the last one.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.413
Come in.

54:54.750 --> 54:56.834
Hi.

54:57.002 --> 54:59.087
Here's the makeup.

54:59.254 --> 55:01.297
Thanks.

55:01.465 --> 55:03.341
Makeup.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.769
Hey, listen, Marilyn.

55:14.937 --> 55:18.356
You know, if you need
to talk about anything,

55:18.524 --> 55:21.067
anything like that,
l'm here.

55:23.070 --> 55:25.613
You know?
'Cause...

55:25.781 --> 55:29.617
l'm sure she's better off
than we are right now.

55:29.785 --> 55:32.787
What are you talking about?

55:36.333 --> 55:37.917
Wendy.

55:44.133 --> 55:46.134
Eva.

55:46.301 --> 55:50.013
You are a very beautiful girl.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.473
( laughs )

55:55.310 --> 55:58.604
And l know you know
what men are like.

55:59.732 --> 56:02.525
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think's gonna happen

56:02.693 --> 56:04.736
the longer that we stay
down here, huh?

56:05.904 --> 56:08.072
What do you think
is already happening?

56:08.240 --> 56:10.158
- l don't know.
- l do.

56:14.038 --> 56:17.832
Listen, if you need to talk
about anything, l'm here, all right?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.418
Don't you think
you should just be

56:20.586 --> 56:22.712
a little nicer
to the rest of the boys?

56:22.880 --> 56:25.048
Especially Josh.

56:26.467 --> 56:28.509
Fucking hands off me.

56:34.433 --> 56:36.517
All you knew we 
had was this much?

56:36.685 --> 56:39.228
That's all there is!
What do you want me to do?

56:39.396 --> 56:41.939
- That's not all there is.
- That's just fucking wonderful, Mickey.

56:42.107 --> 56:44.400
That's impossible. There is no way
we can survive with that.

56:44.568 --> 56:45.943
No way. No way.

56:46.111 --> 56:48.696
You got us into this 
situation, now fix it.

56:48.864 --> 56:52.784
l got us into this situation?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

56:52.951 --> 56:54.535
l was rationing them.

56:54.703 --> 56:56.120
We're gonna fucking starve
to death, Mickey.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.122
We're gonna die of thirst, Mickey.
Where's the food?

56:58.290 --> 56:59.916
What do you want me to do?

57:00.084 --> 57:02.710
l'm not your nanny,
you arrogant prick!

57:02.878 --> 57:04.462
l'll bet you're just waiting
for one of us to die

57:04.630 --> 57:07.465
so you can have all the food
that you can fucking eat, huh?

57:07.633 --> 57:09.884
Oh, shit. What are you--

57:10.052 --> 57:12.595
What is your problem, Mickey?
What is your problem?

57:12.763 --> 57:15.056
My problem is you!

57:15.224 --> 57:16.891
- You're fucking dead.
- And you, and you!

57:17.059 --> 57:18.476
- You're fucking dead, Mickey.
- You're my fucking problem!

57:18.644 --> 57:20.895
- Get back. Get out of here.
- You get out of here!

57:21.063 --> 57:22.480
- Take a walk.
- You get out of here.

57:22.648 --> 57:24.524
- lt's my fucking--
- Take a fucking walk!

57:24.691 --> 57:27.276
Guys, please.
Delvin, come on.

57:37.162 --> 57:40.331
You see he's the only one
not dropping any pounds?

57:40.499 --> 57:43.167
Always stuffing his pig face.

57:43.335 --> 57:45.670
l'm telling you, that motherfucker
is up to something.

57:48.382 --> 57:52.593
Stop playing around with that.
Okay? l'm trying to talk to you.

57:52.761 --> 57:54.011
What do you want to do, Josh?

57:54.179 --> 57:56.264
l want to get that 
fucking door open,

57:56.431 --> 57:58.683
- even if we rip it off its hinges.
- Fucking-A right, man.

57:58.851 --> 58:01.602
Do you agree with everything
my brother says?

58:03.230 --> 58:05.565
You mean your 
half-brother, right?

58:05.732 --> 58:07.817
What, you don't agree?

58:13.490 --> 58:16.951
Have you looked at us?
Huh?

58:17.119 --> 58:20.121
Look at me.
We're dying in here.

58:20.289 --> 58:22.331
Where would you rather be?

58:24.084 --> 58:26.669
Door's welded shut.

58:26.837 --> 58:29.672
We got one working suit.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.091
There's not a lot of options.

58:33.468 --> 58:35.720
There's always options.

59:44.456 --> 59:47.041
l knew you had some stuff
in here somewhere.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.834
You crazy fuck.

59:49.878 --> 59:51.879
lt's a peace offering for--

59:52.047 --> 59:54.382
Thank you. Uh-huh.

59:54.549 --> 59:56.217
Back up.

59:57.469 --> 01:00:00.471
Back up and open it.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.014
All right.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.272
Move over so l can see it.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.148
Start again.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:14.110
Don't give me an excuse
to use this. Open it.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:20.908
Got it.
Now push it open.

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:25.246
- Where's it lead to?
- The fucking White House.

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:28.249
- Where are the lights?
- There ain't no fucking lights.

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:30.668
Don't you fuck with me.

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:35.089
Oh, man.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.945
Help!

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:00.448
lt's Delvin and Mickey.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.669
Holy shit!
What the fuck, Mickey?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.088
This motherfucker,
he comes in here

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.883
and he sticks a Taser in my face,
and he said he was gonna kill me

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:20.676
unless l gave him the rest
of the food and water.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:25.056
Then he-- he goes for the gun.
l caught him off guard.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:28.184
Then we started fighting
over the gun and it went off.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.813
- lt went off?
- Yeah, it just went off.

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.066
And that's it.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.610
lt was self-defense.

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:39.487
lt was--

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.948
- lt was self-defense.
- Eva: Stop!

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.492
- Get off me!
- Bobby, get him!

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.869
lt was self-defense,
motherfucker!

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.996
Adrien, help me!

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:51.207
Sam, get his legs!
Get his legs!

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:54.335
- Get his legs!
- Get off, motherfucker!

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:56.504
- Eva, get the gun!
- Get off!

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:58.714
- Hold on to him!
- Get off me!

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:17.233
lt's a combination lock.
lt won't work.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.944
lt's a combination lock.

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:22.738
Somebody wake him up.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.199
You know what l think?

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:28.244
l think we should kill
the maniac right now.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.579
- Eva: Jesus, Bobby.
- Hey, Mickey.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.873
- All right, let's fucking do it.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.417
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby, Bobby.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.210
Let's get civilized
about this, please.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.587
Come on. Josh?

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.798
You saw what he did to Delvin.
Huh? The guy's a whack-job.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:44.009
He has been fucking with us
since the first--

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:47.054
You know what?
Give me the gun.

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:50.057
Give me the gun.
Eva.

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:51.892
You don't even know
what happened.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.061
- Give me the gun.
- Let's get to the bottom of this first.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.440
- What are you doing? You bitch!
- Josh.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.192
- What if those guys come back, huh?
- Josh, come on.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.528
Get the fuck out of my way.
Fuck.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:05.322
We need the fucking
combination, Mickey.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.867
The combination.

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:10.911
- Aah!
- What is the combination?

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.416
Sam.

01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:18.836
What's behind that door?
Put his head forward.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.214
- Aah!
- What's behind that door?

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.633
- What's behind that door?
- You're gonna die.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.844
- You're all gonna die.
- Huh?

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:29.388
l'll never give you
the combination.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.057
Go get the knife.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:33.767
- No?
- l don't care what you do to me!

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:36.437
You can kill me!
l don't care if l die!

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.606
- You don't care if you die?
- No! l kind of want it.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:40.774
- Aah!
- Huh? You want to die?

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.611
As long as l'm strapped in this 
chair, l'm stronger than you.

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:46.363
You're never gonna get
that combination from me.

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:49.575
- Never!
- No?

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.620
And l will starve to death.
Will you?

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.623
- Bobby!
- Give me the fucking combination,

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.625
Mickey, or l'll slice you
from ear to ear.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.960
- You hear me?
- Stop!

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.880
- You're so fucking dead.
- No! Get off of me, you faggot!

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:06.133
Get off of me, you faggot!
l'll starve to death.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.469
Put the knife down,
you guys, please.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.515
You shouldn't have thrown
the gun down the toilet, Eva.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.475
- Fuckers! Fuckers!
- Come on, Josh, think about it.

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:16.143
- What's the combination?
- Fuck you!

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.437
- Put down the knife.
- Yeah, do it.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:21.106
- Josh, no!
- What's the combination?

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.484
- Put down the knife.
- Do it! Do it!

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:25.319
Josh, no!

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:26.946
- Stop!
- What's the--

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.031
Let her go, Josh.
Let her go. Let her go.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.659
l don't know why
you wanna fight, boy.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.827
Okay, okay, Josh.
Josh, look at me.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.663
- Look at me.
- Stop it, Josh!

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.456
- l'll cut that pretty neck of yours.
- Fuck you!

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:40.501
- Keep the fuck back!
- Look at me, Josh. Look at me.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:42.670
l think it would be a better idea

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.589
before we torture someone,
you let your anger pass.

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:48.759
lf l have to calm down
and rationalize this,

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:52.680
l don't know if l'll be able to take
a knife and cut his fucking fingers off.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:54.848
- Do it!
- No.

01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.979
Last chance, Mickey.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.522
How about that?

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.857
How about that's your
last chance, you fuckin'--

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.861
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Fucking yuppie.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.780
- Do it. Do it.
- Do it. Do it.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.157
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Do it. Go ahead.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:15.953
Go ahead and do it!
Do it, faggot, do it!

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:21.875
How's that feel, huh?
How's that feel?

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.712
How does that fucking feel?

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.466
Oh, God.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:32.886
lt's okay. lt's okay.

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:35.764
Look at that. Look at that.
There it is, huh?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:39.518
See how easy that thing came off?

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:44.523
- Hey, Josh, let's do another one.
- Another one?

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.233
- Yeah. Let's do a thumb.
- You want a thumb?

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.235
- Nine!
- Nine, motherfucker?

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.821
- No!
- What's the combination?

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.408
Mickey, give him
the combination, please!

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:56.160
Okay. Okay.

01:05:56.328 --> 01:05:58.662
- Nine.
- Nine. Come on.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:02.041
11 , then zero, then one.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:05.836
9-11-0-1 .
Now he's a fucking canary.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:09.173
That wasn't so hard,
was it, Mickey?

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.258
Go get the door open.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:14.345
9-11-0-1 . Go.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.513
Just fucking go!

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.477
You faggots!

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.687
Faggot, you'll never
amount to anything.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:26.440
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.778
You're a fucking coward!

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.279
- Coward!
- Nice souvenir, huh?

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:33.947
- Yeah.
- You fucking cowards!

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.574
Hey, Mickey, l got you
in my pocket now.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:37.117
Oh, that's funny.

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:39.953
You're real funny,
you stupid shit.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:44.708
A fucking brain the size
of a fucking pea, you fucking idiot.

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:47.795
You red-headed stepchild.
And you, you fuck!

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:50.589
You're a fucking coward, man.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.967
Fuck you!

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.604
Mickey.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:12.986
Mickey.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.576
Won't you play with me?

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.062
Ooh, they got beans.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.732
See, l told you
he was holding out on us.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.234
We should still kill him.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.486
Shut up, Bobby.

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.225
What did you find?

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.103
Nothing.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.490
Hey, Mickey,

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:42.242
you want to see a magic trick?

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.462
Now you're not alone.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.457
You fucking missed.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.295
You missed.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.463
You want it, Sam?

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.524
Oh, my God.

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:39.860
Oh, God damn it.

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:42.029
That's disgusting.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.531
Marilyn.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:51.038
Don't waste that, Marilyn.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.335
l'm sorry.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:59.546
- l'm sorry.
- Clean yourself up.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.136
Let me massage you.

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.388
No, it just-- it hurts.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.557
- All right? Just--
- l can make you feel better.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.809
No, just-- just stay
off me, all right?

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:15.437
Marilyn, l don't think
he wants to be touched.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.981
You stink, okay?
Just stay off me.

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:20.567
l said get off of me!

01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:25.697
Stay.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.787
Josh: Marilyn, why don't you
put some clothes on?

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:37.084
That filthy nightie is disgusting.
l can't even eat.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.854
Well, thanks, Sam.

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:02.859
Now why don't you go over there
and suck on his dick?

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:05.570
You should suck his dick
because we all know

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.614
that he's not getting any at home.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:11.034
What, Sam, her pussy like
the fucking Sahara or something?

01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:14.162
All right, Josh, let it go.

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:24.631
Marilyn, let me ask you a question.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.843
Why is it that old women
can't age gracefully?

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:29.594
Your tits are at your waist.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:32.347
Someone pulled the ripcord
on your inflatable ass.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:35.475
And your skin
is like fucking sand--

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:37.602
- Josh, leave her alone.
- Stay out of it!

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.981
- l'm not a child.
- No, she's not.

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:43.775
But l like that.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.739
Stop it.

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.534
Oh, what?

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.912
Yeah.
Oh, you, too, Sam?

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.789
Yeah, go fetch her, boy.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.221
Eva.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.849
Eva.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.523
- l can't stand it in here.
- Shh.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:26.610
lt's okay.
lt's okay.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.614
Sam.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.824
- Sam.
- Come on, Eva.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.035
- Sam, please stop. Please stop.
- Please, please, please.

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:37.204
- Sam, just go away.
- Please, please.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.915
- Sam, stop it.
- Eva, please.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.169
Sam, get off of me!

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:05.417
Josh, do l look like
a space alien? Huh?

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:22.767
Holy Mary, mother of God,

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.061
pray for us sinners now

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:28.607
and at the hour of our death.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.512
Hey.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.890
Yeah?

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:04.226
How about a drink?

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.311
Sure.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.695
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.698
Cheers.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:35.799
Thank you.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:13.169
l should go.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:15.046
Yeah.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.766
( sighs )

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:58.631
Liz?

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.093
( sobbing )
l'm so sorry about everything.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:12.145
Come on, you motherfuckers!

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:16.983
Come and get me!
l got nine more fingers for you!

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:02.195
Hey, Marilyn.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:03.863
- lt's gonna be okay.
- Where are you, baby?

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.573
- lt's gonna be okay.
- Bring back that sweet ass.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.618
- You stay with us. Don't worry.
- Marilyn.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:11.413
- You stay with us.
- Oh, there she is.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.081
- She got off the leash again.
- Eva: lt's okay.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:16.084
Marilyn. Marilyn.
Come back to bed.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.420
She's gonna stay in here
with us, all right?

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.048
Josh, let her stay in here.

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:23.633
- Marilyn

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:26.761
Come on, let her go.
Let her go.

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:30.098
- Let her go!
- Eva, she's yours.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.975
Marilyn! Marilyn!

01:19:32.143 --> 01:19:33.643
- Let her go!
- Eva, wait, wait.

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:35.895
- Let her go!
- Wait, let it go.

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:38.398
Aah! Fuck!

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.901
- lt's okay.
- l'm sorry.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.613
l'm sorry.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.078
lt's okay. l'm fine.

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.886
Sorry to interrupt.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.430
You guys have to Mickey-sit.

01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:14.642
And Josh would like
to see you alone.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:37.040
This looked like your size.

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:43.087
What do you want, Josh?

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.426
Decided you should ration
your own food and water.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:53.473
ls this for the three of us?

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.976
No, two.
Mickey's fasting.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.021
Okay.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:03.691
Of course, Eva, if you want more,
l'm open to barter.

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:10.240
No?

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:12.659
Maybe l'll just take this back.

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:18.289
What's going on?

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:21.167
l'm rationing the supplies.

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.754
Yeah, well, Josh,
they're the group's supplies.

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:26.798
lt's not your call.

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:29.801
Well, groups break down into
self-interest during times of scarcity.

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:31.761
And someone needs to make
the tough decisions

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.429
during times of war.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:39.352
lt's in the DVDs.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.688
So what's next, huh?

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:44.190
You cut off Bobby?

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.318
Then me?

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.537
Bro...

01:21:57.705 --> 01:22:00.373
there is only us.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:28.276
Let's do it again.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:41.497
Oh, God, more. More.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:44.709
- l have to ration it.
- Ration your end.

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:47.170
This is our end.
This is what Josh gave us.

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:50.923
Get me out of this chair.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:53.843
You held out on us, Mickey.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:56.304
l was gonna tell you
about the food.

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:59.849
But first l had to make sure
that when this supply ran low,

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:03.144
who l could trust
and who would go bad.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.938
Eva, come here.

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.775
- Come here. Eva.
- What?

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:10.777
Come here.

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.449
There's something in the storage
room they don't know about.

01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:19.035
- What?
- lt's a gun.

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:37.679
Sam.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.014
You have to do something.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:41.891
What the fuck are 
you talking about?

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:43.434
He told me there's another gun.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.645
He's a compulsive liar

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:47.438
and a fucking murderer.

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:50.358
lf you won't help me,
l'll do it alone, Sam.

01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:54.821
What are you gonna do when you 
find that fictional gun?

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:57.156
Are you gonna kill them?

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:59.158
We can't provoke them.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:02.203
l can talk some sense
into them. Yeah.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.247
l was a fucking lawyer,
remember?

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:06.666
l was a fucking...

01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:09.210
Sam, wake up.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:13.423
You were nothing, just a fucking
drug addict living on the streets.

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:16.259
So don't you dare
to tell me to wake up.

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:51.294
You got to be a cowboy.
Cowboys touch penises.

01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:54.297
- Do it. Do it.
- No, no.

01:24:54.465 --> 01:24:56.340
- l'm not gonna touch it.
- Touch it.

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:58.843
- No way.
- He doesn't want to touch it.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.429
- He doesn't want to do it.
- Do that other thing.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.431
- The big one?
- The big one.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.224
What did l just say?

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:07.727
- The little one.
- But you said--

01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:09.854
Little dog.

01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:13.399
The little one.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.943
The little one is a...

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:22.742
The little one choking.
The little one choking.

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:25.745
Give him a treat.

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:27.997
All right, here we go.

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.082
- Eva beaver.
- Wow.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.376
- Come on in.
- No, l just need to talk to Sam.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:34.337
Well, we're in the middle
of a game here.

01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:36.506
Sam, l need to talk to you.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:39.717
- l haven't finished yet.
- He hasn't finished.

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:48.267
Oh, don't worry about Marilyn.
She's zoned out.

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:55.149
You know what?
You should play.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.944
Yeah, come on.
Come on in.

01:25:58.111 --> 01:25:59.779
l insist.

01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:03.407
There we go.
There we go.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.791
Get her a drink, Sancho.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.254
Thank you, maître d'.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:20.132
So, Eva...

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.802
truth or dare?

01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:24.804
l'm not gonna play.

01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:27.974
You're gonna play 'cause you're 
sitting at my fucking table.

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:31.894
How about we play
for food and water?

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.857
So come on.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.984
Truth or dare?

01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:42.321
Truth.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:48.160
Do you love Sam?

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.538
- Good question.
- Come on.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.790
There's no getting out
of this one, Eva.

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:55.668
Do you love Sammy?

01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.547
Yes.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:02.967
Ooh, congratulations, Sam.

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:10.766
And my brother?

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:13.352
You already asked
your question.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.229
That is true, Josh.
Those are the rules.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.481
- That's true.
- Fuck, she got me, man.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.317
- Mm-hmm.

So come on.

Ask a question.
lt's your turn.

01:27:25.532 --> 01:27:27.617
Come on, just say,

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:30.703
"Josh, truth or dare?"

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:32.204
Ask a question.

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:37.752
Okay, dare.
No, truth.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.754
Last time l said dare,
Bobby wanted me

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:42.089
to eat Mickey's finger.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.050
You're a sick fuck.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:47.970
Fucking disgusting.
So come on, ask a question.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.061
Ask a fucking question.

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:08.240
- Ask a fucking question!
- Did you enjoy torturing Mickey?

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:12.912
No.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.748
l did what had to be done.

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:18.250
But what have you done for us?

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:21.253
Huh?

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:23.255
- Come on, Josh.
- Okay, fuck it, Sam.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:26.592
What's up? You want a turn?
Truth or dare?

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.178
Dare.
Go cut up Delvin's body.

01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.439
Come on, Sammy.
Circle of truth.

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:43.442
You accepted the dare, Sammy.
Time to follow through.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:48.906
- l'm not cutting anyone.
- Do it.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:52.410
Don't be such a chickenshit.
Huh?

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:54.620
Do it.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:56.998
- Stop.
- Do it.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.960
- You got a penis, Sam?
- l'm not cutting anyone.

01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:03.379
- Do it.
- Eva: Bobby, stop it.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.297
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:08.634
Eva, how can you be engaged
to such a pussy?

01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:11.220
- Stop it, Bobby.
- Do it! Do it!

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:12.972
- Do it!
- Stop it!

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.558
Atta boy.

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:18.811
Sam, sit down.
Sam, sit down.

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.648
Sam, don't!

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:24.984
Sam, don't.

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:35.619
Sam:
Help me.

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:40.833
Sam, don't.
You don't have to prove yourself.

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:43.127
- You don't have to do this.
- All right, Sam, now remember,

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:45.755
it's just like chopping lumber,
but not.

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:47.882
All right, knock yourself out.

01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:50.051
Go for it.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:55.097
- Hold it high.
- No.

01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:58.350
Don't.

01:29:58.518 --> 01:30:00.436
Come on.

01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:08.194
- You fucking pussy.
- Why don't you do it, Bobby?

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:10.488
You love chopping up people.
Why don't you do it?

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:13.407
Well, you see,
l've already cut up a body.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.993
- Give me a kiss. Right here.
- Whoo!

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.120
l think we know who
the man of the house is.

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:20.414
- Get the fuck-- get off me.
- Robert.

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:22.541
- Get off me.
- Get the ax.

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:25.544
- Sam: No, no, no, no, l can do it!
- You're gonna cut him up.

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:30.549
- Josh, don't!
- What are you doing?

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:33.844
Do it or l break his arms.

01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:35.888
Come on.

01:30:44.106 --> 01:30:46.732
- Do it! Do it!

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.069

Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.333
Who's next?

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:31.337
Bobby.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:40.512
So how's a little bit
off the top?

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.348
You ready?

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:44.308
Okay.

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:04.555
Look at us, huh?
Look at us.

01:34:06.224 --> 01:34:08.726
- Yeah.
- We're the same.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:12.313
The same.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.400
You're my brother now.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.874
Where's the gun?

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:35.085
Get me out of this chair.

01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:44.678
lt's in a red coffee can

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:46.930
in the panic room.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:49.099
l never said l'd untie you.

01:34:49.267 --> 01:34:51.143
You'll do the right thing.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:01.695
Eva,

01:35:01.863 --> 01:35:04.573
there's another way out.

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:07.701
- What?
- Through the septics.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.624
But you're gonna be swimming through 
a  whole lot of god-awful shit.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.281
You know it's in the hair?

01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.409
lt's in the hair.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:52.413
What's the going rate on a 
bottle of water, Sancho?

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.623
Got to be some infidelity for sure.

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:57.960
- Yeah.
- No.

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:00.838
Stop. Stop.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.881
She sounds like a 
racehorse, Robert.

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:04.883
l'll bet she goes off like one, too.

01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:06.718
- Please.
- Don't spoil it.

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:09.513
- Please, not like this.
- Not like what?

01:36:12.142 --> 01:36:14.810
- Robert.
- What?

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:18.105
- Get lost.
- l thought we could share this one.

01:36:25.155 --> 01:36:26.196
Oh, God.

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:28.615
lt's in the hair.

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:41.587
She just broke.

01:36:51.097 --> 01:36:52.598
Hey.

01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:57.519
- What happened?
- Marilyn's dead.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:59.354
They killed her.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:01.273
You okay?

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:45.651
What are you doing?

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:48.320
You have to get the gun.
ln the panic room.

01:37:48.488 --> 01:37:50.364
- Where?
- ln the red coffee can.

01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:53.242
- Hey, assholes.
- Oh, God.

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:55.577
You're supposed to keep
the batteries charged.

01:37:55.745 --> 01:37:57.287
We're trying to watch a movie.

01:37:57.455 --> 01:37:59.706
Yes, Bobby, but it just died.

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:01.375
- All of a sudden.
- What the fuck, Sam?

01:38:01.543 --> 01:38:04.169
lt just died?
What the fuck?

01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:40.664
Store's closed.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.865
Not here. Not here.

01:39:15.033 --> 01:39:17.701
Not here, please.

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:20.203
Please.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:27.377
Come with me.

01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:50.484
This is your fault.
You didn't fucking charge the battery.

01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:53.070
- Sorry. Yeah, yeah, well--
- Oh, shit.

01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.781
Why do you look so nervous, Sam?
Huh? Go do something.

01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:57.908
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.

01:39:58.076 --> 01:39:59.993
You're right. l'm sorry.

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:01.995
- Where are you going?
- l need to go to the toilet.

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:04.373
l'm sorry, Bobby.
You're right.

01:40:14.133 --> 01:40:16.760
Wait. Wait.

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:19.763
Why don't you just slow down?

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:21.890
Oh, bitte. Oh, bitte.

01:40:22.058 --> 01:40:24.309
Oh, bitte.

What are you doing, Sam?

01:40:38.574 --> 01:40:40.826
Well, you said you were
going to the bathroom.

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:43.328
The bathroom's down the hall
and to the left.

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:46.123

- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:03.932
You know, l'm standing here
and you're standing there,

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.977
and we're both thinking
the same thing, aren't we?

What?

01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:13.692
Please, get me out of this chair.

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:30.167
