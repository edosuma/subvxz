WEBVTT

00:02.863 --> 00:04.802
Hey, so I saw a movie trailer
the other day.

00:04.855 --> 00:07.213
How could Batman
possibly fight Superman?

00:07.214 --> 00:08.746
I mean, isn't that dumb?

00:08.748 --> 00:10.048
Maybe he uses Kryptonite.

00:10.050 --> 00:12.050
Well, Batman's got
a lot of money.

00:12.052 --> 00:15.019
Maybe he builds a suit that can
do everything Superman can do.

00:15.021 --> 00:16.354
No, no, no, no, no.

00:16.356 --> 00:18.289
I've seen that movie.
It's called <i> Iron Man.</i>

00:25.732 --> 00:27.866
(quietly):
What is happening?

00:27.868 --> 00:30.368
I don't know.

00:30.370 --> 00:32.871
But it's beautiful.

00:34.407 --> 00:35.974
And now Ben Affleck
is Batman?

00:35.976 --> 00:38.176
Oh, he was great in
<i>Shakespeare in Love.</i>

00:38.178 --> 00:40.178
Ooh, we should watch that
next girls' night.

00:40.180 --> 00:41.379
We could do a double feature

00:41.381 --> 00:42.947
with the Leonardo DiCaprio
<i>Romeo + Juliet.</i>

00:42.949 --> 00:44.716
Oh, I love me some Leo.

00:44.718 --> 00:46.384
And it's gone.

00:47.454 --> 00:49.320
Oh, hello, everyone.

00:49.322 --> 00:52.257
I am happy to report
I'm feeling much better.

00:52.259 --> 00:53.658
Good for you.

00:53.660 --> 00:54.859
(muttering)

00:54.861 --> 00:57.662
My fever is gone,
my sinuses are pressure-free,

00:57.664 --> 01:01.165
and my mucus is as clear
as a Yosemite waterfall.

01:02.569 --> 01:04.669
Glad to hear it.

01:05.839 --> 01:08.540
I'll be able to return
to work tomorrow.

01:09.509 --> 01:11.943
Yay.

01:11.945 --> 01:14.412
Well, why isn't
everyone happy?

01:14.414 --> 01:18.149
Your little ray of sunshine
is ready to beam again.

01:18.985 --> 01:21.052
You really don't know why?
No.

01:21.054 --> 01:23.988
But I knew that his “yay”
was sarcastic.

01:23.990 --> 01:26.090
Not bad for a guy
whose last bowel movement

01:26.092 --> 01:28.259
sounded like rain on a roof.

01:30.297 --> 01:32.931
Let me refresh your memory.

01:33.833 --> 01:34.966
Penny,

01:34.968 --> 01:37.802
rub Vicks on my chest.

01:37.804 --> 01:40.605
Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.

01:40.607 --> 01:42.040
I made your bed.

01:42.042 --> 01:43.942
I checked your mouth for thrush.

01:44.811 --> 01:46.878
You can rub your own chest.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.480
Oh, sure, grope every other
male on the planet,

01:49.482 --> 01:51.082
but draw the line with me.

01:52.886 --> 01:55.420
I brought you a little
care package from work.

01:55.422 --> 01:56.621
It's our latest
antiviral

01:56.623 --> 01:58.590
and the best decongestant
we make.

01:58.592 --> 02:01.292
I hope laughter
is the best medicine,

02:01.294 --> 02:04.128
'cause this care package
is a joke.

02:04.965 --> 02:06.965
Hey, she came
all the way here...

02:06.967 --> 02:08.532
(sneezes)

02:12.505 --> 02:15.273
You're gonna want
to take these with food.

02:16.977 --> 02:19.577
Sheldon,
stop being a baby

02:19.579 --> 02:21.579
and let Emily
take a look at you.

02:21.581 --> 02:23.615
SHELDON: She's a
dermatologist.

02:23.617 --> 02:25.583
I went to medical school.

02:25.585 --> 02:27.485
Well, in that case,
try removing

02:27.487 --> 02:29.320
the irritating
patch of brown skin

02:29.322 --> 02:31.022
standing next to you.

02:33.727 --> 02:37.028
All right, here you go.

02:37.030 --> 02:39.163
Leonard, I'm dying.

02:39.165 --> 02:41.666
You're not dying.
It's just the flu.

02:41.668 --> 02:43.001
I asked for chicken noodle.

02:43.003 --> 02:46.104
This is chicken and stars.
It's killing me.

02:49.342 --> 02:52.010
I never did get
that chicken noodle, did I?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.435
(Skype ringing)

03:23.437 --> 03:24.736
Hi, Sheldon.

03:24.739 --> 03:25.738
Hello.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.540
Are you feeling any better?

03:27.542 --> 03:29.709
Physically, yes, but I'm upset

03:29.711 --> 03:33.279
because everyone's mad at me
for no good reason.

03:34.149 --> 03:36.315
Why don't you tell me
what happened,

03:36.317 --> 03:38.151
and in a gentle, loving way,

03:38.153 --> 03:41.220
I'll explain to you
why you're wrong.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.723
You know how, when you're sick,

03:43.725 --> 03:46.826
you're allowed to be cranky
and say whatever you want

03:46.828 --> 03:49.829
and other people's feelings
don't matter?

03:50.865 --> 03:54.801
Ooh. Gentle and loving--
this is gonna be tricky.

03:54.803 --> 03:56.736
I had a 101 fever.

03:56.738 --> 04:01.073
If that's not a time to verbally
abuse my loved ones, when is?

04:01.075 --> 04:06.512
Sheldon, when you're sick,
you can be... unbearable.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.748
That's why your friends
have been known

04:08.750 --> 04:12.485
to work late
or sneak out to the movies

04:12.487 --> 04:15.087
or stay at
a neurobiology conference

04:15.089 --> 04:17.690
three days after it's ended.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.360
You stayed in Michigan all week
to avoid being around me?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.196
No, no, not just that.

04:23.198 --> 04:24.497
I mean...

04:24.499 --> 04:27.400
Detroit is beautiful
when it's sleeting.

04:28.236 --> 04:30.102
You know, I'm not the only one

04:30.104 --> 04:31.637
who's unpleasant
when they're sick.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.340
When Penny got food poisoning,
she threw up so loudly

04:34.342 --> 04:37.076
I could barely hear
the television.

04:37.946 --> 04:39.479
Ooh, I just heard something.

04:39.481 --> 04:40.847
Might be hail, might be gunfire.

04:40.849 --> 04:43.616
Either way, I'm gonna go
take pictures. Bye.

04:45.787 --> 04:47.119
Hey, Stuart.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.055
Hey. Where's Sheldon?

04:49.057 --> 04:50.156
Still sick?
LEONARD: No, he's fine.

04:50.158 --> 04:52.625
We just needed
a little break.

04:52.627 --> 04:53.759
Yeah, I get that.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.628
When I brought him his comics
the other day,

04:55.630 --> 04:58.731
he said, “Oh, great,
Death is literally at my door.”

05:00.034 --> 05:01.868
He was being a jerk
to everyone.

05:01.870 --> 05:03.102
Don't take it personally.

05:03.104 --> 05:05.204
Oh, I'm on so many
antidepressants,

05:05.206 --> 05:07.473
I couldn't if I wanted to.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.944
I wish we could do more stuff
without Sheldon.

05:11.946 --> 05:14.580
I wish that all the time.

05:14.582 --> 05:18.951
Usually before I blow
out birthday candles.

05:18.953 --> 05:21.787
You know, Amy took
some time off from him.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.223
Really improved
their relationship.

05:24.225 --> 05:25.625
Huh. Okay.

05:25.627 --> 05:28.160
As long as it doesn't end
with us having coitus with him,

05:28.162 --> 05:29.495
I'm in.

05:30.565 --> 05:32.765
We should all take
a trip or something.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.467
You know, Penny and
I have been talking

05:34.469 --> 05:35.801
about taking a
weekend in Vegas.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.403
Maybe we should all go.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.138
Bernie would love that.

05:39.140 --> 05:40.373
Oh! Ooh! Maybe we could get

05:40.375 --> 05:42.341
one of those party buses
to take us there.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.643
That sounds really fun.

05:43.645 --> 05:44.710
Yeah, that sounds fun.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.312
A party-bus party don't stop.

05:46.314 --> 05:49.215
Ooh! When I say “party,”
you say “bus.”

05:49.217 --> 05:51.951
No. No.
(in rhythm): No. No!

05:54.188 --> 05:56.055
So, the guys and I
were talking about

05:56.057 --> 05:58.291
renting a party bus and
everyone going to Vegas.

05:58.293 --> 05:59.825
Oh, that could be fun.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.128
But just to be clear,
you mean a party bus

06:02.130 --> 06:03.462
with booze and music, right,

06:03.464 --> 06:05.898
not, like, juice boxes
and video games?

06:05.900 --> 06:07.333
Yes.

06:07.335 --> 06:09.835
And Howard's birthday
was a drop-off party.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.471
You didn't have to stay.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.773
Well, I'm in.

06:13.775 --> 06:15.308
When are we going?
This weekend.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.343
Oh, where are we going?

06:18.179 --> 06:19.745
Well, Vegas, but...

06:19.747 --> 06:21.581
Ugh, Atlantic City
without the taffy?

06:21.583 --> 06:23.115
No, thank you.

06:24.285 --> 06:26.452
That's fine, 'cause actually
you're not invited.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.487
Well, now...
well, that's hurtful.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.623
Oh, Sheldon, you don't
even like it there.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.191
I can consider a place

06:32.193 --> 06:33.459
America's urinal cake

06:33.461 --> 06:36.195
and still enjoy
the occasional visit.

06:36.197 --> 06:37.964
Not this time.

06:37.966 --> 06:40.499
Oh, fine. Then I'll just
hang out with Wolowitz.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.102
He's coming, too.
Well, then Raj and I will...

06:43.104 --> 06:45.871
Nope.
Very well. Stuart.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.373
Oh, great. Do that.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.344
Ugh. Stuart.

06:52.547 --> 06:54.513
Hi, Sheldon. What's new?

06:54.515 --> 06:57.049
Our friends are jerks,
and I'm mad at all of them.

06:57.051 --> 06:59.919
I said, “What's new?” but sure.

07:00.722 --> 07:02.254
Can you believe
they planned a trip

07:02.256 --> 07:04.223
to Las Vegas
and didn't invite me?

07:04.225 --> 07:05.858
Did you refuse to apologize

07:05.860 --> 07:08.260
and act like they were stupid
for being mad?

07:09.297 --> 07:11.330
You know, I liked it better
when there was still

07:11.332 --> 07:13.599
a little mystery left
in our relationship.

07:14.402 --> 07:16.435
Everyone tried
to take care of you,

07:16.437 --> 07:18.571
and you were nothing
but mean to them.

07:18.573 --> 07:20.406
I can't believe
you're not on my side.

07:20.408 --> 07:24.677
I was on your side when someone
stole your car radio.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.115
Who else's side
could you have been on?

07:29.117 --> 07:31.217
I don't know.

07:31.219 --> 07:34.420
A music-loving hobo
with a heart of gold?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.556
Sheldon, I understand
that you're upset

07:37.558 --> 07:39.225
because you feel left out,

07:39.227 --> 07:41.761
but I don't know why
we're even talking about this.

07:41.763 --> 07:43.496
Just apologize to them.

07:43.498 --> 07:47.099
Fine, if that's what it takes
to go on their dumb trip.

07:47.101 --> 07:50.269
Maybe you could try apologizing
because you actually feel bad.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.337
It's called empathy.

07:51.339 --> 07:53.773
It's something
you could work on.

07:53.775 --> 07:55.508
I have empathy.

07:55.510 --> 07:57.009
Watch.

07:57.011 --> 08:00.212
Leonard made me soup,
and I was mean to him.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.017
Great.

08:05.019 --> 08:08.954
Now try it as if this isn't
your first day as a person.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.023
Fine.

08:11.025 --> 08:14.627
Leonard made me soup,
and I was mean to him.

08:14.629 --> 08:16.796
Hey, I felt a little something.

08:16.798 --> 08:18.164
Let me try again.

08:18.166 --> 08:22.702
Leonard made me soup,
and I was mean to him.

08:22.704 --> 08:24.970
I was mean to him.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.373
He must have felt terrible.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.376
Oh, now I feel terrible.

08:30.378 --> 08:32.778
Neat!

08:33.614 --> 08:35.280
Glad I could help.

08:35.283 --> 08:37.349
Now let me see you
feel bad for lying

08:37.351 --> 08:39.952
and staying in Detroit
longer than you needed to.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.489
(flatly):
I feel so, so bad.

08:43.491 --> 08:46.459
Hey, we're both great at this.

08:50.198 --> 08:53.165
Leonard, get ready
for an apology.

08:53.167 --> 08:56.302
And with the added twist
of an M. Night Shyamalan movie,

08:56.304 --> 08:58.304
I'm going to mean it.

08:58.306 --> 08:59.972
Ah, so like every other

08:59.974 --> 09:01.540
M. Night Shyamalan movie
I've seen,

09:01.542 --> 09:04.243
you spoil it in advance.

09:04.245 --> 09:05.811
Hey, if you didn't know
Bruce Willis

09:05.813 --> 09:08.681
was dead the whole time,
that's not on me.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.284
Okay.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.753
Here it comes.

09:13.755 --> 09:15.087
You tried to take care of me

09:15.089 --> 09:17.356
when I was sick,
and I was mean to you.

09:17.358 --> 09:19.458
There's no excuse for that.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.660
And I'm truly sorry.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.662
Thank you.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.997
I appreciate that.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.066
I want you to know
that that is sincere.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.334
I-I do feel bad.

09:28.336 --> 09:30.536
I'm not just saying it
to be included on your trip.

09:30.538 --> 09:32.738
Appreciate that, too.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.140
Terrific.

09:34.142 --> 09:36.142
Now all that's left
is for you to invite me to come.

09:36.144 --> 09:37.409
Me to ask, “Are you sure?”

09:37.411 --> 09:38.577
You to say, “Absolutely.”

09:38.579 --> 09:39.678
And then me
to bring it home with,

09:39.680 --> 09:42.414
“How could I say no
to that face?”

09:42.416 --> 09:45.050
You're still not coming.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.419
What? But I apologized
and I meant it.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.188
I know that we don't play
this game very often,

09:49.190 --> 09:51.257
but you're doing it wrong.

09:51.259 --> 09:54.026
Sheldon, I accept
your apology, but you upset

09:54.028 --> 09:55.327
a lot of people
while you were sick.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.463
I'm not in a position
to just say you can come.

09:57.465 --> 09:59.665
Well, all right.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.868
What if I apologize
to all of them?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.804
Fine, if you
apologize to everyone,

10:04.806 --> 10:07.006
they all say it's okay,
then yes, you can come.

10:07.008 --> 10:08.474
Challenge accepted!

10:08.476 --> 10:11.610
Sounds like it's time for
the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.

10:13.915 --> 10:15.214
Well, I hope
it's as much fun

10:15.216 --> 10:18.784
as the Sheldon Cooper
Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.452
(laughing):
My goodness!

10:20.454 --> 10:23.722
Do you remember
“comes with apsparagus”?

10:25.000 --> 10:31.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

10:32.944 --> 10:34.844
Howard and Bernadette,

10:34.846 --> 10:36.846
you tried to comfort me
when I was ill,

10:36.848 --> 10:39.115
and I treated you terribly.

10:39.117 --> 10:40.717
I'm sorry.

10:40.719 --> 10:42.452
Wow.
(chuckles)

10:42.454 --> 10:43.686
I'm impressed.

10:43.688 --> 10:44.721
No, no, no, wait.

10:44.723 --> 10:45.789
I'm not done.

10:45.791 --> 10:47.924
Allow me to underscore
my sentiment

10:47.926 --> 10:49.692
with a haunting rendition

10:49.694 --> 10:51.528
of Brenda Lee's “I'm Sorry”

10:51.530 --> 10:53.696
played on the pan flute.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.667
Apology accepted!
Forgiven, forgiven!

10:57.669 --> 11:01.070
All right, that's eight hours
of practice down the drain.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.708
And to memorialize
this occasion,

11:05.710 --> 11:08.611
here are your
commemorative T-shirts.

11:13.518 --> 11:16.719
“Sheldon Cooper
apologized to me”"

11:16.721 --> 11:19.789
“And he made it
all better.”

11:21.126 --> 11:22.792
(camera clicks)

11:24.930 --> 11:26.930
All you did was offer

11:26.932 --> 11:29.065
maternal care and affection,

11:29.067 --> 11:30.967
and all you received in return

11:30.969 --> 11:34.304
was rude and insensitive
behavior.

11:34.306 --> 11:36.406
Can this wait?

11:36.408 --> 11:37.874
I'm afraid it can't.

11:37.876 --> 11:39.042
The trip is tomorrow.

11:39.044 --> 11:40.844
And I have
more apologies to make.

11:40.846 --> 11:43.146
Okay, fine, I accept
your apology, now get out!

11:43.148 --> 11:45.081
Wonderful. would you mind
holding up this shirt

11:45.083 --> 11:47.317
while I take a quick...?
Leonard!

11:50.188 --> 11:53.623
You brought me my comic books
when I wasn't feeling well.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.625
That-that was
thoughtful.

11:55.627 --> 11:56.793
And I was insensitive.

11:56.795 --> 11:58.228
I'm sorry.

11:58.230 --> 11:59.829
Thank you, Sheldon.

11:59.831 --> 12:01.598
I appreciate that.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.133
And I want you to know
that I mean it, you know?

12:04.135 --> 12:08.204
This isn't me just wanting to
go on the trip to Las Vegas.

12:11.042 --> 12:14.177
What trip to Las Vegas?

12:14.179 --> 12:16.145
The one everyone's taking

12:16.147 --> 12:18.648
this weekend on the party bus.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.084
Of course, I wasn't invited.

12:21.086 --> 12:24.988
That would be my understanding.

12:26.057 --> 12:27.924
On a less painful subject,

12:27.926 --> 12:29.959
what size T-shirt do you take?

12:33.098 --> 12:35.932
Raj, you were being
a good friend,

12:35.934 --> 12:39.602
and my illness was no
excuse for my behavior.

12:39.604 --> 12:42.739
I hope that you can
accept my apology.

12:42.741 --> 12:44.607
Of course I do.

12:44.609 --> 12:47.610
And, Emily, I'm sorry
for saying dermatologists

12:47.612 --> 12:49.546
aren't real doctors.

12:49.548 --> 12:52.916
And I'm sure you're
tired of hearing that.

12:55.053 --> 12:58.021
Do you honestly think
I hear that a lot?

12:58.023 --> 13:00.456
Well, I would imagine
when your job is popping zits

13:00.458 --> 13:02.792
and squirting Botox
into old lady faces...

13:02.794 --> 13:04.093
Okay!

13:04.095 --> 13:06.796
Okay, the point is

13:06.798 --> 13:09.032
that we accept
your apology.

13:09.034 --> 13:10.199
Uh, maybe you do.

13:10.201 --> 13:12.001
He just insulted me again.

13:12.003 --> 13:13.670
Yeah, but he
doesn't mean it.

13:13.672 --> 13:15.338
Why are you defending him?

13:15.340 --> 13:16.573
(stammers) I believe
I can answer that.

13:16.575 --> 13:17.740
Uh, like me,

13:17.742 --> 13:19.742
Raj is demonstrating empathy.

13:19.744 --> 13:22.011
Now, why don't you
accept my apology,

13:22.013 --> 13:24.781
receive your free T-shirt, uh--

13:24.783 --> 13:26.783
I hope extra small is okay.

13:26.785 --> 13:29.719
For some reason
Wolowitz took a medium.

13:30.789 --> 13:33.389
Well, I don't
accept your apology.

13:33.391 --> 13:34.657
What are you doing?

13:34.659 --> 13:36.626
It's called standing
up for myself.

13:36.628 --> 13:37.760
You should try it some time.

13:37.762 --> 13:40.463
Fine, how about this?

13:40.465 --> 13:42.699
You're making me
uncomfortable by prolonging

13:42.701 --> 13:44.901
this ridiculous fight,
and I wish you'd stop.

13:44.903 --> 13:46.536
Oh, you want me to stop?

13:46.538 --> 13:47.570
No problem.

13:47.572 --> 13:49.038
No, come on,
please don't leave!

13:49.040 --> 13:50.306
(Sheldon stammers)

13:50.308 --> 13:51.941
Point of clarification--
are you still going on the trip?

13:51.943 --> 13:53.109
Because if not...

13:53.111 --> 13:55.078
Don't worry, you're good.

13:57.515 --> 14:00.416
I caused that fight,
I feel terrible.

14:00.418 --> 14:03.486
(stammers)
Wait, I can do that better...

14:04.456 --> 14:06.756
I caused that fight.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.124
I feel terrible.

14:08.126 --> 14:11.561
Yeah, wow, I don't know
which one I like more.

14:12.664 --> 14:14.897
So, was the fight
really bad?

14:14.899 --> 14:16.132
(stammers)
No.

14:16.134 --> 14:17.834
As a fight, it was excellent.

14:17.836 --> 14:21.037
She used harsh language
and slammed the door.

14:21.039 --> 14:22.772
Although as I say this,

14:22.774 --> 14:25.108
that might not have been
what you were asking.

14:25.110 --> 14:27.844
You think they'll
still go on the trip?

14:27.846 --> 14:29.946
All I know is after the fight
I went to Emily's to smooth...

14:29.948 --> 14:32.915
They're not going on the trip.
No.

14:34.252 --> 14:36.452
What is wrong with you?

14:36.454 --> 14:39.756
Look at him, caring about
what's wrong with me.

14:39.758 --> 14:42.425
That is some top-shelf empathy.

14:44.262 --> 14:46.763
Hey, well,
we should start a club.

14:46.765 --> 14:49.432
You went to Emily's
to apologize.

14:49.434 --> 14:51.968
And when you left,
she was crying.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.336
That is true.

14:53.338 --> 14:56.072
Well, I suppose
I should apologize again.

14:56.074 --> 14:58.775
(all saying no)

14:58.777 --> 14:59.909
Is she okay?

14:59.911 --> 15:01.878
Yeah, I calmed her down.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.213
But she's not going
to Vegas if he's going.

15:04.215 --> 15:06.149
Wait, that's an option?

15:06.151 --> 15:09.419
I didn't know that
was an option.

15:09.421 --> 15:10.753
Well, that is fine,
because I've decided

15:10.755 --> 15:12.188
that I won't be joining you.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.424
I've realized that
the most genuine way

15:14.426 --> 15:16.693
to demonstrate the remorse
I feel is to let you

15:16.695 --> 15:18.961
have this weekend
to yourselves.

15:19.764 --> 15:22.632
That's very mature of you.

15:22.634 --> 15:24.567
Well, I've been on a little
trip myself recently.

15:24.569 --> 15:28.237
Not to Sin City
but to Sincere City.

15:30.308 --> 15:31.974
Where instead of genital warts,
the only growth

15:31.976 --> 15:35.011
you'll come back with
is personal growth.

15:36.081 --> 15:38.848
And there's your next T-shirt.

15:41.786 --> 15:44.587
Ooh, check out
the stripper pole.

15:44.589 --> 15:45.988
You know what that means.

15:45.990 --> 15:48.958
That Raj'll be on it before
we make it to the freeway?

15:48.960 --> 15:50.593
You know it!

15:50.595 --> 15:52.662
(whooping)

15:54.199 --> 15:55.565
This is so cool.

15:55.567 --> 15:56.966
Let's have champagne!

15:56.968 --> 15:58.701
Mm-hmm.

15:58.703 --> 16:01.370
Well, I would like
to propose a toast

16:01.372 --> 16:02.872
to a well-deserved weekend of...

16:02.874 --> 16:04.674
Aha!
(all scream)

16:06.878 --> 16:09.312
What are you doing?!

16:09.314 --> 16:11.948
My plan was to jump out
at the state line,

16:11.950 --> 16:15.485
but one of my nose plugs
fell into the toilet.

16:15.487 --> 16:19.088
You couldn't give us
just one weekend?

16:19.090 --> 16:21.624
I told him
this was a bad idea.

16:24.763 --> 16:26.395
What do we do--
kick them off?

16:26.397 --> 16:27.964
If we drop them off
at a fire station,

16:27.966 --> 16:30.900
they have to take them;
no questions asked.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.971
Before you do, please
give me one more chance

16:34.973 --> 16:36.973
to apologize to Emily.

16:36.975 --> 16:38.708
Oh, God.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.844
Emily, as I'm
sure you know,

16:41.846 --> 16:44.747
I'm considered
an odd fellow.

16:46.818 --> 16:48.618
But what you don't know
is that, while I often

16:48.620 --> 16:52.188
say the wrong thing,
in my heart I mean well.

16:52.190 --> 16:54.090
I think that you are

16:54.092 --> 16:57.093
a smart and wonderful
woman, you know?

16:57.095 --> 17:00.730
And we all think that you can
do better than Koothrappali.

17:01.766 --> 17:03.399
You know, Sheldon...

17:03.401 --> 17:06.202
Shh, let him finish.

17:06.204 --> 17:08.171
So, for all the times
I've offended you

17:08.173 --> 17:10.740
and all the times that
I'll offend you in the future,

17:10.742 --> 17:13.643
I'm sorry.

17:15.180 --> 17:16.479
Thank you.

17:16.481 --> 17:17.914
Good.

17:17.915 --> 17:20.016
Then I'll be leaving now.

17:20.018 --> 17:22.318
Oh, it's okay, Sheldon.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.487
Come with us.

17:24.489 --> 17:26.789
Oh, that's very kind of you.

17:26.790 --> 17:29.325
But I'm sure you'll all have
a better time without me.

17:29.327 --> 17:30.827
Let's go, Stuart.

17:30.829 --> 17:32.328
But I want to stay.

17:32.330 --> 17:33.663
Stuart, now!

17:41.005 --> 17:42.471
You know,
I know he's a jerk,

17:42.473 --> 17:44.173
but I actually
feel bad for him.

17:44.175 --> 17:48.110
And now you see
the problem.

17:50.281 --> 17:53.683
Come on, you pain in the ass!

17:53.685 --> 17:55.051
That's me!

17:55.053 --> 17:56.519
Bye, Stuart.

17:56.521 --> 17:58.621
Wait!

17:58.623 --> 18:02.058
I'm a pain in the ass, too!

18:10.426 --> 18:12.627
Are you relieved
that you and Raj

18:12.629 --> 18:14.629
were able
to patch things up?

18:14.631 --> 18:16.163
At the moment?

18:16.165 --> 18:18.165
No, not really.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.600
♪ Burn, baby, burn... ♪

18:19.602 --> 18:21.369
Shake it, baby!

18:21.371 --> 18:24.171
(whoops)
Work that thing!
