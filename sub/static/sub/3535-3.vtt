WEBVTT

00:00.189 --> 00:01.795
Perhaps it is high time

00:02.093 --> 00:03.781
- My shit gets famous again.
- Oh.

00:03.901 --> 00:06.328
I just need somebody
to give me a shot.

00:06.811 --> 00:08.508
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

00:08.628 --> 00:10.111
Okay. Let's go, buddy.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.717
- I gave up fame for true love.
- No, no, no, no.

00:12.837 --> 00:14.837
Love? I wanna see what
that stripper look like.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.439
Oh, baby.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.964
- Give me one more shot.
- Okay, don't blow it, Kenny.

00:20.084 --> 00:21.326
I won't blow nothing.

00:21.446 --> 00:24.162
- No, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dontel.

00:24.282 --> 00:26.154
Whoa!

00:26.274 --> 00:29.086
You know what, Guy?
I'm out of this motherfucker.

00:30.817 --> 00:34.879
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:35.497 --> 00:37.931
Holy shit!
I killed it in there!

00:37.972 --> 00:39.908
You were so awesome!

00:39.973 --> 00:42.177
Your quips were
sensational, Kenny.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.599
Ha! Yo, Tinseltown,
show-business better look out

00:45.664 --> 00:47.610
because I'm coming for ya.

00:47.643 --> 00:49.883
You were so great, baby.
You had so much control.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.891
Hey, April, did your pussy
get wet in there?

00:51.924 --> 00:54.729
I know if I had a pussy
it'd be wet as shit.

00:54.762 --> 00:56.572
I'd be like squirting...

00:56.605 --> 00:58.674
Dude, why you talking about
my wife's private parts?

00:58.718 --> 01:01.863
Oh, well... No, I'm sorry.
I apologize, Lady Powers.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.197
Don't call her Lady Powers.
Just call her April, man.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.865
Come on, don't ruin this
celebratory moment

01:05.898 --> 01:07.603
with being shameful and vulgar.

01:07.636 --> 01:09.280
No, no. I don't mean
to ruin it. I'm just so excited.

01:09.313 --> 01:11.014
I haven't
felt this good in so long.

01:11.055 --> 01:14.160
I just wanna...
I just wanna punch something.

01:16.858 --> 01:17.897
- Yo, what the fuck?!
- Oh, my God!

01:17.930 --> 01:20.497
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck?!

01:20.530 --> 01:22.937
- Kenny!
- Stevie, are you OK?

01:22.970 --> 01:24.370
- Kenny, help me.
- No, no, no, no.

01:24.403 --> 01:27.507
Gross! No, no, no. Don't get
your fucking blood on me.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.643
Ugh!

01:29.676 --> 01:35.011
Stevie, breath.

01:35.052 --> 01:37.119
OK, I'm gonna see you at home.

01:37.152 --> 01:38.964
- Bye, baby. I love you.
- I love you.

01:41.338 --> 01:42.874
See you later, pumpkin.

01:48.782 --> 01:51.215
Children, raise your 5 Alives.

01:51.248 --> 01:53.751
Because of my
amazing television efforts

01:53.784 --> 01:56.390
and my newfound relationship
with show-business,

01:56.423 --> 01:57.759
we never have to worry
about money again.

01:57.794 --> 02:00.362
Picture the future. You're both
entering high school.

02:00.395 --> 02:03.498
While all the other dum-dums
are there selling dime bags

02:03.531 --> 02:05.338
and trading
Garbage Pail Kids cards,

02:05.371 --> 02:07.106
you'll be polishing
your Porsches.

02:07.139 --> 02:09.643
Riding your horses,
hanging out with the preps

02:09.675 --> 02:12.584
with sweaters loosely tied
around your necks.

02:12.617 --> 02:15.623
Let the memories of this
patriarch begin now.

02:15.728 --> 02:17.528
- To Daddy.
- To Daddy.

02:17.561 --> 02:19.264
- To Daddy.
- And now,

02:19.329 --> 02:20.360
the giving of the gifts.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.432
- Gifts?
- That's right.

02:22.465 --> 02:24.266
I bought everyone
a small token to commemorate

02:24.306 --> 02:26.444
this amazing moment
for our family.

02:26.477 --> 02:29.546
First up is Mama.
Look at that, huh.

02:29.587 --> 02:32.128
Oh, this is nice.

02:32.161 --> 02:33.860
That's a fair trade candle.

02:33.901 --> 02:35.230
We now can afford
to buy products

02:35.271 --> 02:37.939
- that are made the right way.
- Smells so good, babe.

02:37.972 --> 02:40.578
Next up, Shayna Bear.

02:40.611 --> 02:42.242
Lookie lookie lookie here.

02:42.283 --> 02:44.011
Little shorty's got back.

02:44.052 --> 02:45.916
A Louis V backpack, that is.

02:45.949 --> 02:47.653
That's a mighty big gift
for her.

02:47.718 --> 02:50.497
Oh yes.
Several grand, in fact.

02:50.530 --> 02:51.666
Where's my present?

02:51.699 --> 02:56.636
He is in the garage.

02:56.669 --> 02:57.836
Meet Dakota.

02:57.869 --> 02:59.972
I got him from
a Craigslist Indian.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.740
Is that a real wolf?

03:01.773 --> 03:03.412
Pure bred.
That's what the red man told me.

03:03.445 --> 03:05.149
There's no paperwork
or anything because of

03:05.182 --> 03:07.047
their goddamn oral traditions.

03:07.088 --> 03:10.223
But... seems legit to me.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.216
You know, I'm not so sure that
this is a good gift

03:12.223 --> 03:13.224
for a five year old.

03:13.257 --> 03:14.393
What are you talking about,
April?

03:14.426 --> 03:15.731
This is a perfect gift
for Toby.

03:15.764 --> 03:17.164
With my new high-paying
television job

03:17.198 --> 03:18.468
I'm not gonna be around
the house as much

03:18.501 --> 03:20.068
as I'd like to be.
So it's very important

03:20.101 --> 03:22.636
that Toby has
a strong male role model

03:22.669 --> 03:23.637
so he doesn't turn out weird.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.310
Dakota's gonna serve
as a spirit guide.

03:25.375 --> 03:26.343
Hey.

03:26.408 --> 03:29.415
You watch yourself,
motherfucker.

03:29.448 --> 03:30.879
Because of this opportunity,

03:30.920 --> 03:32.520
our family's gonna be
taken care of forever.

03:32.553 --> 03:35.058
Who knows, next stop
could be space camp.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.193
- Who wants to go to space?
- Me.

03:37.226 --> 03:39.490
Who wants to pet this wolf?

03:39.531 --> 03:41.864
Hey.

03:41.897 --> 03:49.599
I'm a television star
and I own you.

03:49.632 --> 03:54.128
Whoo! Goddamn. Kenny Powers,
series regular on TV.

03:54.169 --> 03:56.305
Feels like the first day
of school out here, huh?

03:56.339 --> 03:57.474
Oh yeah.

03:57.507 --> 03:59.139
Everybody's inside the cafeteria

03:59.172 --> 04:00.533
wanted to know
what I'm gonna wear.

04:00.539 --> 04:03.070
What kind of crazy shit's
gonna come out of my mouth.

04:03.103 --> 04:05.539
They all know that I'm just
the wild card this show needs

04:05.572 --> 04:07.443
to nab that elusive demographic.

04:07.476 --> 04:09.276
That <i>Hunger Games</i> demo.

04:09.309 --> 04:11.147
That <i>John Carter from Mars</i> demo.

04:11.180 --> 04:13.680
Kenny, you skew
extremely young.

04:13.713 --> 04:14.908
Yeah, no shit.

04:14.941 --> 04:16.243
Now where we at
with them gift baskets?

04:16.276 --> 04:17.274
We locked and loaded?

04:17.308 --> 04:19.978
They're right here, dog.
Boom.

04:20.011 --> 04:24.078
Whoo. Looking good. Moose Munch.
Coffee macadamia toffee.

04:24.111 --> 04:26.279
- You know what the move is.
- What's the move?

04:26.312 --> 04:28.782
Put my motion picture personal
autobiographical screenplays

04:28.815 --> 04:31.009
into Guy Young's gift basket.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.711
That's how the Antwone Fisher
story was made.

04:32.744 --> 04:34.382
Autobiographical screenplay,
Kenny?

04:34.447 --> 04:36.149
When do I get to read it?

04:36.182 --> 04:38.285
Well, when I get the N.D. forms
filled out by my lawyer.

04:38.318 --> 04:40.421
Until then, you ain't
touching shit, dog.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.388
A'ight. I'll back off.

04:42.421 --> 04:44.887
I'll back off.
But soon. Hopefully.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.252
Enough of your
creative sensitivities.

04:47.285 --> 04:49.284
Let's give people some baskets.

04:49.317 --> 04:52.084
You smell like a horses ass.
I don't want to smell you.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.325
It's a professional environment.

04:53.358 --> 04:54.725
- I'll talk to her.
- Please, talk to her.

04:54.790 --> 04:55.790
I will.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.196
A tisket, a tasket.

04:57.229 --> 04:58.291
I brought you a
motherfucking gift basket.

04:58.324 --> 05:00.425
Kenny P.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.627
- Oh, shit, is that for me?
- Yeah, that is for you.

05:02.668 --> 05:04.532
- Well, this is for you.
- Ah, shit.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.436
Great minds think alike.
What's up, my man?

05:06.469 --> 05:08.266
- Look at that, huh.
- All right.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.073
- Whoo.
- Oh, Harry and David.

05:10.106 --> 05:11.570
A top purveyor,
I like that a lot.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.212
Goddamn. Yeah,
I also included

05:13.309 --> 05:15.677
a copy of my new motion picture
screenplay I recently finished,

05:15.710 --> 05:18.684
450 pages of box office gold.
It's my life story, dude.

05:18.717 --> 05:21.020
Whoa. Kenny Powers
is a writer too, huh?

05:21.053 --> 05:22.484
Screenplayist.

05:22.517 --> 05:23.755
Who's this handsome pumpkin
right here?

05:23.820 --> 05:24.987
Is this your fuck buddy?

05:25.020 --> 05:26.219
I wish.

05:26.253 --> 05:27.260
What the fuck is this?

05:27.293 --> 05:29.630
That's a coupon book
for activities

05:29.663 --> 05:31.568
in and around the Charlotte
area. You're gonna like that.

05:31.601 --> 05:34.537
Grandfather Mountain, Carowinds.
A waterpark.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.837
My kids are gonna shit their
pants when they see this.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.501
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna shit my pants

05:38.534 --> 05:40.635
looking at this
expensive-ass squirt bottle

05:40.668 --> 05:42.203
of Morrocan hair oil.

05:42.236 --> 05:43.877
That shit'll get you smelling
like an Egyptian cab driver.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.311
I'm sure it's very nice
and thank you, Kenny.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.382
Hey, you're welcome.

05:46.415 --> 05:48.549
I think this is gonna be
a wonderful union.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.548
Kenny Powers is just the thing
this show needs

05:50.581 --> 05:51.780
to get the ratings up.

05:51.814 --> 05:53.053
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that, Kenny.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.621
- The ratings are just fine.
- Yeah, I know.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.851
We'll just, you know,
focus on the four quadrant

05:56.884 --> 05:58.786
- target market, Nielsens.
- Kenny, the ratings are fine.

05:58.819 --> 06:00.154
Conrad, tell him,
the ratings are fine.

06:00.187 --> 06:02.259
- They're good.
- They'll be better, though.

06:02.292 --> 06:03.965
That would be...
Don't worry about that.

06:03.998 --> 06:05.735
You know what I mean?
Keep your mind on the prize.

06:05.768 --> 06:07.671
All right. I'll leave
the mathematics to you guys.

06:07.704 --> 06:10.204
I'll focus on the
"lights, camera, action."

06:10.237 --> 06:11.929
- Show-business.
- Show-business. KP.

06:13.537 --> 06:17.072
There's my smart boy.
Oh God, look at you.

06:17.104 --> 06:20.040
So handsome.

06:20.073 --> 06:22.440
Get on the ground! This is
a fucking home invasion!

06:22.473 --> 06:26.814
Jesus.

06:26.879 --> 06:28.979
- It's me.
- Oh, my God.

06:29.012 --> 06:30.713
Oh, word.
Wayne, you're graduating?

06:30.746 --> 06:33.605
No. He is getting his GED
actually, Kenny.

06:33.645 --> 06:36.071
You dumbass.
There's a ceremony for that?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.142
What's up, bro?

06:37.175 --> 06:38.741
What the hell are you
doing here, Kenny?

06:38.774 --> 06:41.976
Relax, guys.
I'm not here to terrorize.

06:42.017 --> 06:44.913
Just came by for a
friendly family visit.

06:44.954 --> 06:48.088
It's no mystery that over the
years our families have drifted.

06:48.121 --> 06:51.084
- Our families are strange.
- Estranged.

06:51.117 --> 06:52.955
That's what I'm saying,
Cassie, that we're str...

06:52.988 --> 06:54.820
You didn't say that.
You said "strange".

06:54.853 --> 06:56.387
- That's what I'm saying.
- No, you didn't.

06:56.420 --> 06:58.355
- Shit's not... No, I said...
- You said strange.

06:58.388 --> 07:00.091
Look, you know what I'm
getting at. We're not friends.

07:00.124 --> 07:03.132
- What do you want, Kenny?
- I wanna squish our beef.

07:03.197 --> 07:05.995
What I've done in the past
is of no merits here.

07:06.036 --> 07:08.203
The bottom line, I wanna
buy back your family's love

07:08.236 --> 07:11.803
with these fucking dope passes
to Congo Canyon Resort.

07:11.836 --> 07:15.274
Congo Canyon?

07:15.307 --> 07:17.138
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not so fast, sticky fingers.

07:17.178 --> 07:19.442
What do you say, Dustin?
Let's put aside our differences.

07:19.475 --> 07:21.082
Take leaks in the lazy river.

07:21.115 --> 07:23.378
Take our shirts off and
slide down water slides.

07:23.419 --> 07:24.386
What do you say?

07:24.419 --> 07:26.416
Not interested.

07:26.449 --> 07:28.616
Dustin, I think Kenny
is trying to apologize...

07:28.649 --> 07:29.688
You stay out
of this, Cassie.

07:29.721 --> 07:31.720
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Don't fight, OK?

07:31.794 --> 07:33.489
Look, I got my fame back.

07:33.522 --> 07:35.329
And I wanna share it
with my kinfolk.

07:35.362 --> 07:36.856
I'm ready to do it right
this time.

07:36.897 --> 07:39.065
All you do when you get famous
is act like a bigger asshole.

07:39.098 --> 07:41.034
- OK.
- Dustin, I'm a mature man.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.939
I have a wife and kids. I listen
to fucking Terry Gross now.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.434
<i>Wait, wait. Don't tell me.</i>

07:45.475 --> 07:47.136
Motherfucking
<i>This American Life.</i>

07:47.169 --> 07:48.968
No. You're the same
as you always were.

07:49.009 --> 07:49.936
First chance you get,

07:49.977 --> 07:51.441
you're gonna burn
all that to the ground.

07:51.474 --> 07:52.673
You don't know what I'm trying
to burn to the ground.

07:52.778 --> 07:54.409
You're just being nasty
and being a jerk.

07:54.482 --> 07:55.914
None of you motherfuckers
are gonna get tan

07:55.947 --> 07:57.714
and take your shirts off
with me.

07:57.787 --> 07:59.218
You're all gonna be dry.

07:59.251 --> 08:00.985
The only people
that get to get wet

08:01.018 --> 08:02.817
are people that are nice to me.

08:02.858 --> 08:06.523
Goodbye, you.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.699
- <i>Let's dance, dog.</i>
<i>- Yeah, dog.</i>

08:11.732 --> 08:12.931
Check out Yul Brynner.

08:12.964 --> 08:14.933
I just bought his fucking ass
on Sky Mall.

08:14.974 --> 08:17.710
OK. It was a car last week
and now it's a robot.

08:17.743 --> 08:19.914
And this weekend you're taking
everybody to the water park.

08:19.979 --> 08:21.651
You know what? I think this
is just getting out of hand.

08:21.684 --> 08:22.715
I think we need to take it slow.

08:22.748 --> 08:24.787
We took it slow for five years,
April.

08:24.819 --> 08:25.816
And it fucking sucked.

08:25.849 --> 08:27.352
It was not that bad.

08:27.385 --> 08:28.655
It was terrible, April.

08:28.688 --> 08:30.792
Literally, I almost killed
myself 20 different times.

08:30.857 --> 08:33.054
I put a gun in my mouth and
almost pulled the trigger.

08:33.087 --> 08:34.727
I ain't going back to them days.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.063
OK, I can't take you
seriously right now

08:36.128 --> 08:37.294
because you're dancing
with a robot.

08:37.327 --> 08:39.429
- <i>Aw.</i>
<i>- Oh, look. Now you've insulted him.</i>

08:39.462 --> 08:40.796
How rude.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.832
Go about your journeys, Yul.

08:43.905 --> 08:45.338
<i>See ya.</i>

08:45.371 --> 08:47.980
All I'm saying is that we've
been given an opportunity

08:48.014 --> 08:49.780
and I just don't want it
to change us.

08:49.812 --> 08:52.177
Man, you're spitting the same
shit Dustin was throwing at me.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.290
Talking about burning this
whole thing to the ground.

08:54.313 --> 08:56.018
Why the hell doesn't
anybody trust me?

08:56.051 --> 08:58.251
I just don't want us to rush
into anything, that's all.

08:58.284 --> 09:00.617
Rush into what? Buying our
family exotic robotics?

09:00.658 --> 09:03.284
Fucking treating our
loved ones and friends

09:03.317 --> 09:05.651
to a weekend at the water park?

09:05.684 --> 09:07.253
I mean, come on.
It's not that big of a deal.

09:07.294 --> 09:08.694
I mean,
unless of course you got

09:08.727 --> 09:10.727
some sort of weird issue
with slides.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.135
I don't got nothing
against slides, Kenny.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.703
Not even the ones
with the inner tubes?

09:14.736 --> 09:15.967
No. I love the ones
with inner tubes.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.399
What about the ones
with the mats?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.936
Love the ones with mats.

09:20.009 --> 09:21.409
Prove it.

09:21.442 --> 09:26.342
Big tits go in there.

09:26.375 --> 09:29.706
<i>Fame for me has been</i>
<i>a many headed Hydra.</i>

09:29.747 --> 09:32.681
<i>You cut off one head</i>
<i>and it sprouts another.</i>

09:32.714 --> 09:35.716
<i>My baseball career was beheaded</i>
<i>on a warm night in Texas</i>

09:35.749 --> 09:37.189
<i>many years ago.</i>

09:37.222 --> 09:43.989
<i>So be it. A new head</i>
<i>is sure to grow in it's place.</i>

09:44.054 --> 09:45.718
<i>Perhaps the head</i>
<i>of a movie star.</i>

09:45.759 --> 09:48.494
<i>Or a race car driver.</i>

09:48.527 --> 09:51.556
<i>One head might be</i>
<i>selfish and mean,</i>

09:51.629 --> 09:53.362
<i>but that doesn't mean</i>
<i>the next head to replace it</i>

09:53.395 --> 09:58.837
<i>can't still be</i>
<i>thoughtful and nice.</i>

09:58.870 --> 10:08.134
<i>The Hydra has many heads.</i>

10:09.807 --> 10:12.111
Look at my family,
so happy and joyous.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.972
They love me so much.

10:15.045 --> 10:18.309
I just hope I don't
let them down.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.518
Yeah. In Mexico
you just slide down

10:20.551 --> 10:21.684
the fucking garbage chute, huh?

10:21.718 --> 10:22.779
- Uh-huh.
- With a hose on it.

10:22.811 --> 10:24.080
Hey, Kenny. Thank you.

10:24.113 --> 10:25.216
- Thanks, Ken.
- On behalf of all of us.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.082
- Thank you.
- Hey, no worries.

10:27.123 --> 10:28.588
I can't believe
your fancy TV job

10:28.621 --> 10:30.221
gives you free passes
to the water park.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.800
That's so cute.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.728
Is it cute?
I wouldn't call it cute.

10:34.769 --> 10:36.535
I mean, cute's kinda
what I would use to describe

10:36.568 --> 10:38.031
like a cabbage patch kid.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.871
I mean, I just figured
they'd give you season tickets

10:40.904 --> 10:43.606
to Panther games or something
a little more la-di-da.

10:43.639 --> 10:45.237
I don't really know what the
hell you're getting at

10:45.270 --> 10:46.941
but, uh, I do get
those things too.

10:46.974 --> 10:48.541
- We do.
- This is just all I'm sharing

10:48.574 --> 10:50.182
with you guys.
The fucking entry level junk.

10:50.215 --> 10:52.213
- Ohh. Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:52.246 --> 10:54.851
And also, don't try
to poke holes in my shit.

10:56.252 --> 10:58.316
It's time to celebrate,
don't masturbate.

10:58.349 --> 11:00.050
Just celebrate,
don't masturbate.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.618
Shots all around.

11:01.651 --> 11:04.059
- Shots all around.
- Don't use limes.

11:04.092 --> 11:06.195
- Don't use limes.
- No training wheels.

11:06.228 --> 11:07.722
I would like to propose a toast

11:07.763 --> 11:09.329
- to old friends...
- Yes.

11:09.362 --> 11:10.728
- ...and new friends.
- Yes.

11:10.761 --> 11:13.357
Gene and Tel, you guys
are awesome. Awesome.

11:13.430 --> 11:15.398
But there's someone
even more awesome.

11:15.463 --> 11:17.902
The man who made this
all possible.

11:17.935 --> 11:20.300
The most generous,
selfless man.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.569
- To TV's newest star,
- Whoo!

11:22.602 --> 11:23.697
- the love of my life,
- Oh yeah.

11:23.738 --> 11:28.673
Mr. Kenny Powers.

11:28.706 --> 11:31.541
Down the hatch.

11:31.574 --> 11:34.875
Let's remember to pace ourselves
today, boys and girls, OK?

11:34.908 --> 11:36.875
- Nah, fuck that shit.
- Well, what about the kids?

11:36.908 --> 11:38.442
You know, I just think I'm
getting a little wasted.

11:38.475 --> 11:40.474
That's like goddamn
ankle deep water.

11:40.507 --> 11:41.578
Ain't nobody drowning
in that shit.

11:41.611 --> 11:42.714
If one of them kids can drown,

11:42.747 --> 11:44.482
then they don't deserve
to be alive.

11:44.515 --> 11:46.146
This is a goddamn
Darwinism right here.

11:46.187 --> 11:47.650
Waiter!

11:47.683 --> 11:49.618
Another round
for me an my friends here.

11:49.651 --> 11:53.024
I'm waiting to see Tel dip
them balls in some whiskey.

11:53.057 --> 11:54.518
Motherfucker came here
in a Speedo.

11:54.551 --> 11:56.221
Surprise!

11:58.000 --> 12:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:41.680 --> 12:44.107
- Hey!
- <i>Jaws.</i>

12:44.140 --> 12:45.578
What the fuck, dude?

12:45.611 --> 12:47.209
You got a big old nasty boner
in your pants.

12:47.242 --> 12:48.914
I know, why you trying to play?

12:48.947 --> 12:50.650
Man, Kenny, I remember
when I used to wait

12:50.683 --> 12:52.184
for the goddamn things
to go down.

12:52.217 --> 12:54.077
My dick is so fucked right now.

12:54.118 --> 12:55.484
Well, have you tried
using drugs,

12:55.517 --> 12:57.316
like Cialis or Viagra
or some shit?

12:57.349 --> 12:59.190
I've used all the pills
and penis pumps.

12:59.223 --> 13:00.424
But it doesn't do anything.

13:00.457 --> 13:02.225
It just makes my dick
bright red, man.

13:02.258 --> 13:03.529
You need to see a doctor, dude.

13:03.562 --> 13:05.065
No, there's gotta be
some way, man.

13:05.098 --> 13:07.297
Do you know any other
magic spells or dick tricks?

13:07.330 --> 13:09.369
I mean, I guess the
only advice I could have

13:09.402 --> 13:11.197
is just maybe you should just
appreciate what you got.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.598
Even if what you got is a woman

13:12.631 --> 13:13.952
that's built
like mashed potatoes.

13:13.968 --> 13:16.473
- Mashed potatoes?
- See to her needs, dog.

13:16.506 --> 13:19.011
Tend to her.
Kiss, caress, attend.

13:19.044 --> 13:20.548
Kiss, caress, attend.

13:20.581 --> 13:22.052
You see where we're going here.

13:22.085 --> 13:23.716
I'm trying to isolate
your performance anxiety

13:23.749 --> 13:25.590
by focusing on her needs,
homey.

13:25.623 --> 13:28.056
You just gotta figure out how to
put some gravy on them taters.

13:28.097 --> 13:30.358
- Oh, some cum gravy.
- There you go.

13:31.861 --> 13:33.027
All right, here's the deal.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.991
I'm not paying for the
<i>queso</i> or the <i>enchiladas</i>.

13:35.024 --> 13:42.135
But we will pay
for the <i>guacamole.</i>

13:42.168 --> 13:43.367
Sweep the leg.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.040
Sweep slumdog's leg.

13:46.073 --> 13:48.009
- Ahh!
- Hey, hey!

13:48.042 --> 13:50.744
Ah, this is so much fun.

13:50.776 --> 13:54.174
Damn it, Brennan!
You're supposed to hold on.

13:54.207 --> 13:57.139
It's been like a little
while since I've done this

13:57.180 --> 13:58.378
so you just like,
need to be easy.

13:58.412 --> 13:59.411
What is she doing?

13:59.444 --> 14:02.579
OK, go ahead.
Just be easy.

14:02.612 --> 14:04.082
Pull it up.

14:04.115 --> 14:07.354
April. Honey, this
is absolutely inappropriate.

14:07.387 --> 14:10.722
- Dix! How you doin', Dix?
- I'm not that great

14:10.756 --> 14:12.156
because our children
are right over there.

14:12.189 --> 14:13.525
Dix, I think you need
to do this with me.

14:13.598 --> 14:15.093
- I need you to grab a beer
- No, no thank you.

14:15.134 --> 14:17.027
and a boy and let's get
hammered together.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.066
No. You know what
I'm gonna grab?

14:18.099 --> 14:19.530
I'm gonna grab your husband.

14:19.595 --> 14:20.964
Ah, come on!

14:21.005 --> 14:22.533
Oh yeah!

14:22.574 --> 14:23.575
There you go, get him.

14:23.608 --> 14:26.678
Grab his Speedo.
Rip his swim cap off.

14:26.743 --> 14:29.410
Kenny. You better come
get your wife right now.

14:29.443 --> 14:30.704
- Why?
- She's drunk.

14:30.737 --> 14:37.814
Time out. Time out.

14:37.847 --> 14:40.718
Goddamn.
She is getting fucked up.

14:40.751 --> 14:41.918
All right, you.
Get in here.

14:41.983 --> 14:42.982
I got a trash can down here

14:43.015 --> 14:44.222
in case you get sick, all right?

14:44.255 --> 14:45.918
- I gotta wash my hair.
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.021
- No, no.
- I gotta wash...

14:47.054 --> 14:48.053
You wash it in the morning,
all right?

14:48.087 --> 14:49.190
I got puke in it.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.191
No, no. There's no puke in it.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.360
I think it's just
sun tan lotion.

14:51.393 --> 14:52.962
Where the hell
are your shoes at?

14:52.995 --> 14:54.131
You wanna get under the covers?

14:54.164 --> 14:55.098
I wanna get under the covers.

14:55.131 --> 14:56.201
Yeah, that's what I'm
saying, goddamn it.

14:56.234 --> 14:59.106
Get under these covers.

14:59.139 --> 15:06.577
There you go.

15:06.610 --> 15:09.017
- Daddy, is Mom OK?
- Yeah, she's cool, man.

15:09.050 --> 15:10.945
She's just pooped
from riding all those rides.

15:10.986 --> 15:13.320
- Y'all like movies?
- Yeah!

15:13.353 --> 15:15.888
Yeah. How about
<i>G.I. Joe: Retaliation?</i>

15:15.921 --> 15:17.858
I didn't really appreciate it
the first time I saw it

15:17.891 --> 15:20.260
but upon multiple viewings
it holds up.

15:20.293 --> 15:22.765
You guys watch it two,
three times? That cool?

15:22.798 --> 15:24.102
- OK.
- Yeah.

15:24.135 --> 15:25.966
Why don't you sing your mom
your goodnight song.

15:25.999 --> 15:28.871
<i>â™ª Goodnight,</i>
<i>goodnight, goodnight â™ª</i>

15:28.904 --> 15:29.977
Whoo!

15:30.013 --> 15:32.978
<i>â™ª Goodnight,</i>
<i>goodnight, goodnight â™ª</i>

15:33.011 --> 15:33.977
Whoo!

15:34.011 --> 15:34.945
I was trying to get

15:34.978 --> 15:36.281
into my computer the other day

15:36.314 --> 15:38.153
and I couldn't get in.
I was typing in "WakeForest",

15:38.186 --> 15:40.855
which is my password.
"WakeForest", denied. "WakeForest", denied.

15:40.889 --> 15:42.687
For a moment there you were
locked out of your own computer.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.151
I didn't know...

15:44.191 --> 15:45.790
It's a really bad feeling
when you lock yourself out.

15:45.824 --> 15:48.253
Finally, I realize,
when I set up the password,

15:48.294 --> 15:50.092
I used a dollar sign
instead of the "S".

15:50.125 --> 15:52.126
- So, duh.
- Boom.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.398
Jesus Christ, dude.
The women are sleeping upstairs,

15:54.431 --> 15:56.732
Gene's putting us to sleep
down here. My God.

15:56.765 --> 15:58.932
- I like Gene's stories.
- You like Gene's stories.

15:58.965 --> 16:00.637
Of course you do. Because
they're fucking boring, Tel.

16:00.670 --> 16:02.438
- Just like you.
- Oh, snap.

16:02.471 --> 16:03.838
- Come on.
- All right.

16:03.871 --> 16:04.942
Jesus Christ.

16:04.975 --> 16:06.742
You're not Kenny Powers,
are you?

16:06.775 --> 16:08.110
Uh, yes, I am.

16:08.143 --> 16:09.863
Every day and night.
Are these shots for me?

16:09.879 --> 16:10.878
- Yeah... Well, I thought...
- Thank you very much.

16:10.911 --> 16:13.088
- ...we could, uh...
- Mm.

16:13.121 --> 16:15.554
- ...toss a few back.
- Mm.

16:15.587 --> 16:17.891
- All right.
- Boom. Gratitude.

16:17.924 --> 16:19.459
- Nice to meet you.
- Take care.

16:19.492 --> 16:22.466
- My name's Shawnsee.
- This is Jessie.

16:22.499 --> 16:24.697
Don't worry,
she's just my sister.

16:24.730 --> 16:27.999
Yeah. I saw you on TV
fighting that black dude

16:28.032 --> 16:30.071
and it fucking cracked me up.

16:30.104 --> 16:31.639
It's always nice to meet a fan,
of course.

16:31.672 --> 16:33.809
Oh shit. This is uncle Hal.

16:33.842 --> 16:36.715
He's fucking crazy, man.
He's just like you.

16:36.748 --> 16:38.714
I don't really see
the resemblance.

16:38.809 --> 16:40.713
My eyes aren't all fucking
vacant and hollow like his.

16:42.387 --> 16:43.788
Why don't you hang out
with us, Kenny?

16:43.821 --> 16:46.326
You wanna take this party
upstairs?

16:46.359 --> 16:48.231
Actually, we were about
to head out.

16:48.264 --> 16:50.431
No, no. Ignore this
Taliban cleric over here.

16:50.464 --> 16:52.463
Let's take the party upstairs.

16:53.705 --> 16:55.266
Hey, is there a
different Wi-Fi password

16:55.273 --> 16:56.968
- on this floor of the hotel?
- Put that shit away.

16:57.001 --> 16:58.608
- What's wrong with you, man?
- I'm trying to...

16:58.673 --> 17:02.375
Fuck. I just took a big old dump
and now I'm ready to party

17:02.408 --> 17:04.375
with Kenny Powers.

17:04.407 --> 17:07.013
Cocaine.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.911
Whoa! Jesus. No thanks.

17:08.952 --> 17:11.886
- I got a buzz from the beers.
- Whoa, whoa.

17:11.919 --> 17:13.718
- Hard drugs.
- Hard drugs?

17:13.751 --> 17:15.422
Your people make this shit,
right?

17:15.454 --> 17:18.125
Look at you, all scared shitless
over a schedule 2 narcotic.

17:18.157 --> 17:19.724
I'll show you fucking drugs.

17:19.758 --> 17:22.493
I'll show you exactly how to do
some motherfucking drugs.

17:22.527 --> 17:38.614
Eyebrow licking time.

17:49.591 --> 17:54.130
Gene and Tel.
The cocaine monster is here.

17:54.163 --> 17:55.730
What are you doing?

17:55.763 --> 17:59.371
You motherfuckers...

17:59.404 --> 18:01.309
Come on, your turns
to do cocaine.

18:01.342 --> 18:02.774
No. I'm not doing any coke, man.

18:02.808 --> 18:05.447
- Cause it's pretty late...
- Dudes, dudes. Sh-sh-sh-sh.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.414
Just don't give me this shit
right now. Listen.

18:07.447 --> 18:10.749
We fucking are sharing some
important times in our lives.

18:10.782 --> 18:12.516
Let's fucking add
to the sensations.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.918
- All right. Kenny, enough.
- Kenny, come on.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.728
This was supposed to be about
the kids, all right?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.159
We're not supposed to be up here
having this party.

18:17.192 --> 18:19.758
Gene, brother. Brother man.
Come on, dude.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.859
I know your jokes
fucking suck...

18:21.892 --> 18:23.253
- No, man.
- ...but win my respect.

18:23.259 --> 18:25.099
That's enough, OK?
We're gonna go to bed.

18:25.132 --> 18:27.564
- It's been...
- Tel, goddamn it. Do cocaine.

18:27.597 --> 18:29.100
- No.
- OK. I'm just kidding around.

18:29.133 --> 18:30.468
- But do cocaine.
- Kenny.

18:30.501 --> 18:34.109
- Sleep well.
- OK, Tel. I will.

18:34.142 --> 18:35.845
The fuck?

18:35.878 --> 18:40.913
How's it going?

18:40.946 --> 18:42.480
- You guys.
- Jesus.

18:42.513 --> 18:45.415
Don't say a fucking word
about what you saw in there.

18:45.448 --> 18:48.247
- Do you hear me?
- Of course. I'm just tired.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.487
Yeah, you're tired.
If you tell your fucking wives,

18:50.520 --> 18:52.779
I swear to God I will tell them
that you slept with those women.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.187
Jesus, man.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.282
I paid for all your
fucking families to be here.

18:56.355 --> 18:59.520
You said you got
those tickets from work.

18:59.553 --> 19:01.487
How dare you.
How dare you.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.318
Tel, get him out of here.
I don't wanna see him.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.561
Get him out of here. Go.

19:05.626 --> 19:07.127
- Get!
- Let's go, let's go, Gene.

19:07.160 --> 19:22.634
How dare you, Gene.

19:22.675 --> 19:26.536
Uh... I got good news.

19:26.577 --> 19:30.944
My sister wants to
suck your dick.

19:30.977 --> 19:34.584
- That's dope news.
- And also, your balls.

19:34.617 --> 19:36.414
She told me to tell you that.

19:36.447 --> 19:40.315
That's very flattering. She's
a pretty fucking gorgeous girl.

19:40.348 --> 19:43.149
But I'm married, homes.
Fucking locked down.

19:43.190 --> 19:46.491
Fucking, my balls don't get
no attention anymore.

19:46.524 --> 19:48.417
Yeah.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.319
What's wrong with you?

19:50.352 --> 19:58.066
Wanna go swimming?

19:58.099 --> 19:59.401
Come on, come on.

19:59.434 --> 20:00.736
Keep up, keep up.

20:00.768 --> 20:11.208
Sh-sh-sh-sh.

20:12.479 --> 20:20.419
OK.

20:20.492 --> 20:25.793
Show 'em what you got.

20:25.826 --> 20:28.899
No lines at the water park.

20:28.932 --> 20:31.532
This is what I call
a wet dream.

20:31.565 --> 20:35.301
Oh, take it off.

20:35.334 --> 20:42.370
Don't fall. I think that
my face is too...

20:42.403 --> 20:45.135
This water's really warm.

20:45.168 --> 20:47.134
Oh my God, my nipples are hard.

20:47.167 --> 20:48.671
We've been partying

20:48.704 --> 20:50.704
- like wild, right?
- Yeah.

20:50.745 --> 20:52.377
Your brother's pretty
fucking crazy, too.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.283
- We're twins.
- Yeah,

20:54.316 --> 20:56.616
- you said as much.
- I know.

20:56.649 --> 20:58.916
He was talking some pretty
crazy shit up there about you.

20:58.949 --> 21:00.780
Oh, my God.
Like what was he saying?

21:00.813 --> 21:03.851
All kinds of shit. Fucking
spilling the beans on your ass.

21:03.884 --> 21:06.083
Beans?
Like what kind of beans?

21:06.116 --> 21:07.450
Like in a salad or what?

21:07.523 --> 21:10.119
No, not beans in a salad.
Just stuff you've been saying.

21:10.152 --> 21:12.189
What I been saying?

21:12.222 --> 21:14.987
I don't know. You tell me
what you told him to tell me.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.658
You wanna hear?

21:17.691 --> 21:20.718
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you.

21:20.751 --> 21:24.453
In my room. Room 289.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.322
Yeah?

21:27.355 --> 21:32.962
Yeah.

21:32.995 --> 21:36.359
Oh, Jessie.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.229
Sweet, young...

21:39.294 --> 21:42.764
full of promise and potential.

21:42.797 --> 21:44.358
You know I really do
appreciate the fact

21:44.365 --> 21:48.704
that you're drawn to me
and what, I do.

21:48.735 --> 21:50.796
But no.

21:50.837 --> 21:54.340
I can't come up
to your hotel room.

21:54.373 --> 21:56.740
I've been given
a second chance at fame.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.738
I got people depending on me.

21:58.771 --> 22:01.935
Got a wife, kids, family.

22:04.408 --> 22:08.446
I can't abuse this second chance
I've been granted.

22:08.479 --> 22:10.414
They're will be
no dick sucks tonight.

22:10.447 --> 22:12.444
Like, I can't lick it
or whatever?

22:12.477 --> 22:15.314
No. Just...

22:15.347 --> 22:20.050
My dick can't ever be
in your mouth ever, OK?

22:20.083 --> 22:21.783
I... OK.

22:21.816 --> 22:22.854
- So...
- It's for the best...

22:22.887 --> 22:24.286
- Oh, so...
- No, you go ahead.

22:24.319 --> 22:25.222
- No, no. I'm sorry.
- What were you gonna say?

22:25.255 --> 22:26.590
No, you go ahead.
What were you gonna say?

22:26.623 --> 22:28.663
I was just gonna say
it's warm in here so it's nice.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.326
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, no. It is warm, I know.

22:30.359 --> 22:31.495
For a second, like,
I was thinking it was cold.

22:31.528 --> 22:32.926
But no, it is warm.

22:32.959 --> 22:34.693
- It's late, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:34.726 --> 22:36.332
It's so pretty.

22:36.366 --> 22:40.436
What do you think
the other guys are doing?

22:40.469 --> 22:42.867
And I don't even think that
cocaine did that much to me.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.569
It's just like I'm inside
of a rainbow right now.

22:45.602 --> 22:47.438
On one hand, I feel like
I'm talking too much.

22:47.472 --> 22:49.772
On the other hand, I don't
feel like I'm talking enough.

22:49.805 --> 22:52.939
Like I have more to...
Ohh. Oh, it feels so good.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.452
- Security! Get out of the pool.
- Oh!

22:54.476 --> 22:57.738
- Kenny, it's the cops!
- Oh, shit!

22:57.779 --> 22:59.546
It's the cops.

22:59.579 --> 23:15.679
Come on, goddamn it. Shit.

23:35.424 --> 23:45.105
Kiss, caress, attend.

23:45.138 --> 23:49.639
- Kiss, caress, attend.
- Harder.

23:49.672 --> 23:54.045
- ...caress, attend.
- Harder.

24:01.577 --> 24:02.943
What is it, Stevie?

24:02.984 --> 24:05.077
It's not you, it's me, OK?

24:05.150 --> 24:07.452
I did coke tonight.
I've coked it.

24:07.485 --> 24:09.918
I did tons and tons of coke.

24:14.522 --> 24:23.193
Fuck me.

24:23.226 --> 24:39.340
Dear God, should I go
get my dick sucked?

24:46.846 --> 24:56.384
Jessie.

24:56.417 --> 25:00.154
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:00.195 --> 25:01.529
Congratulations.

25:01.562 --> 25:03.390
What?

25:03.423 --> 25:05.723
I decided to take you up on
one of those sweet cock sucks

25:05.756 --> 25:06.995
you were talking about
from earlier.

25:07.028 --> 25:09.293
Oh.

25:09.326 --> 25:13.165
No, honey. No.
You were right.

25:13.198 --> 25:16.171
You have a family. We can't.
It's too messed up.

25:16.204 --> 25:18.910
You don't have to worry
about that, it's fine.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.744
No, I'm sorry.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.350
Goodnight.

25:26.384 --> 25:42.501
Goodnight.

26:01.931 --> 26:03.897
- Is it time to get up?
- No, no, no, no.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.296
The kids are still asleep.

26:06.368 --> 26:11.999
Listen, I got to admit it.
That you were right.

26:12.039 --> 26:16.670
I needed this.
We needed this.

26:16.703 --> 26:21.678
Thank you so much
for making me realize it.

26:21.712 --> 26:25.721
Because I had a fucking blast.

26:25.754 --> 26:28.751
Yeah. Well, I told you
that this would be awesome.

26:28.784 --> 26:32.054
So, yeah.
It's a great time.

26:32.087 --> 26:34.591
OK. So now you can be
really honest with me.

26:34.624 --> 26:36.328
How bad did I embarrass myself?

26:36.361 --> 26:37.895
- Ah, come on.
- Come on.

26:37.928 --> 26:39.966
- You can tell the truth.
- No, no. You were fine.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.160
Seriously, don't get
in your head about it.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.905
Nothing bad happened.
Nothing at all.
