00:00.190 --> 00:01.524
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:01.559 --> 00:03.372
You've got a nuclear
physicist carrying your water?

00:03.372 --> 00:04.688
Dr. Theodore Sinclair.

00:04.721 --> 00:06.321
We had no idea you were a physicist.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.617
Let me guess, something's
recapturing neutrons.

00:08.652 --> 00:11.655
Reactor fuel. What if
reactor plutonium isn't pure?

00:11.689 --> 00:13.088
Frank always assumes the worst.

00:13.122 --> 00:14.711
You were married when I met you.

00:14.736 --> 00:17.903
He wanted to start a
new life. He was naive.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.890
What did you do at work
today? Trick question.

00:19.925 --> 00:22.241
If somebody asked that on
the phone, I'd have to cut in.

00:22.734 --> 00:24.330
Let us play.

00:24.909 --> 00:27.248
You want me to sleep
with... they're all whores?

00:27.282 --> 00:29.383
It's $2.50 for last night.

00:29.418 --> 00:33.564
So what happens now? We go
back to being sworn enemies?

00:33.598 --> 00:36.640
Well, as long as we're both
stranded, how about a drop to drink?

00:36.675 --> 00:38.725
Or we could skip the drink.

00:38.919 --> 00:41.567
- I have to go back to the office.
- What's wrong?

00:41.997 --> 00:43.550
I don't know yet.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.838 --> 01:38.976
ID, please.

01:49.730 --> 01:52.234
Hello?

01:54.462 --> 01:56.498
Helen.

02:00.915 --> 02:05.085
Well, look what
Schrodinger's cat dragged in.

02:05.119 --> 02:08.559
I spent the last two weeks
checking the alpha neutron reaction

02:08.592 --> 02:11.002
of every element on the periodic table.

02:11.026 --> 02:12.905
- You want a gold star?
- Beryllium,

02:12.905 --> 02:14.897
fluorine, boron... they're all fine.

02:14.932 --> 02:17.736
Then I started to wonder,
how much plutonium-240

02:17.770 --> 02:19.339
is mixed in with the 239?

02:19.373 --> 02:21.375
Maybe we got a problem
with spontaneous fission?

02:21.409 --> 02:23.244
It's 5:00 A.M.

02:23.279 --> 02:25.450
I read a paper on the nuclear shell model.

02:25.485 --> 02:27.789
It theorized that even-numbered isotopes

02:27.823 --> 02:29.957
have a higher spontaneous
fission rate than odd.

02:29.992 --> 02:32.695
I read that paper. I
know the guy who wrote it.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.400
Are you gonna invite me in?

02:38.435 --> 02:40.327
Sure.

02:40.603 --> 02:43.238
You can whisper fission rates in my ear.

02:43.272 --> 02:46.176
Tell me secrets you can't
share with your wife.

02:46.210 --> 02:49.311
I'll laugh at your jokes
and you'll loosen your tie.

02:49.346 --> 02:51.950
Maybe we could have a
drink, see what happens.

02:54.486 --> 02:56.320
Ugh, darn.

02:56.355 --> 02:58.223
I'm fresh out of whiskey.

03:10.993 --> 03:13.396
Who was that? Christmas caroler?

03:13.611 --> 03:16.479
No, just a soldier looking for a good time.

03:16.513 --> 03:17.780
Mmm.

03:30.336 --> 03:31.816
Operator.

03:32.005 --> 03:34.337
This call will be monitored
for your protection.

03:36.598 --> 03:38.766
Hello? Is anyone there?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.530
Manhattan 1x08
The Second Coming

04:10.632 --> 04:14.626
Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

04:17.801 --> 04:20.103
Anyone heard of Stephen Blackpool?

04:20.137 --> 04:22.703
What about Bill Sikes?

04:22.738 --> 04:25.038
Crosley, you must know some of these guys.

04:25.072 --> 04:26.539
Allow me to hazard a guess.

04:26.573 --> 04:29.960
- Is Wilkins Micawber on the list?
- Uh, right here.

04:29.985 --> 04:31.576
- Yup.
- He a friend of yours?

04:31.676 --> 04:35.074
He emigrated to Australia
to embark upon a new life.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.340
Unshackling himself from the
chains of his own history.

04:38.375 --> 04:39.671
Well, then how did he wind up

04:39.706 --> 04:41.272
in the British delegation
to the Manhattan Project?

04:41.307 --> 04:43.707
He didn't. It's a codename.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.210
They all are.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.546
Invented by Charles
Dickens a century ago. No?

04:48.580 --> 04:50.817
So they know how to choose
pretentious pseudonyms.

04:50.851 --> 04:52.894
Let's hope that they know
something about physics.

04:53.256 --> 04:55.958
A British scientist is worth two Americans.

04:56.209 --> 04:58.212
2.2, to be precise.

04:58.237 --> 05:00.006
It's just like converting
kilos into pounds.

05:00.031 --> 05:02.208
Well, your countrymen are
bringing quite a dowry with them.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.999
More than two years of research.

05:04.033 --> 05:06.902
They've had an atomic program
since Hitler was in art school.

05:06.936 --> 05:10.409
If we can recruit them, we'll
finally have a fighting chance.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.245
They've got to give us at
least one Brit for implosion.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.148
Oppenheimer barely tolerates our existence.

05:15.183 --> 05:17.318
You really think he's gonna up
and hand us Nicholas Nickelby?

05:17.353 --> 05:19.621
Oppenheimer's not going
to hand us anything.

05:19.655 --> 05:21.956
He's letting the Brits
choose which group they join.

05:21.991 --> 05:25.260
Well, no offense, but who's going
to choose this group over Thin Man?

05:25.294 --> 05:27.530
The Brits had 30 scientists

05:27.564 --> 05:29.910
working on implosion the past year.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.369
They did?

05:31.394 --> 05:33.126
All we have to do is show
them how far we've gotten

05:33.151 --> 05:35.569
on these test shots and
they'll come running.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.077
Frank.

05:37.374 --> 05:39.441
If you'll accept the advice of a native,

05:39.476 --> 05:41.858
there is an art to seducing
a proper Englishman.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.130
Crosley's right. Akley's probably fattening

05:44.155 --> 05:46.251
them up with filet mignon as we speak.

05:46.285 --> 05:49.074
Crosley, you must have shared a dorm
room at Eton with half of these guys.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.432
Yeah, and shared a manservant
at Oxford with the other half.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.155
Yeah, I suppose I could serve
as your cultural liaison.

06:06.263 --> 06:08.728
I can find my own way out.

06:08.762 --> 06:11.482
Not that you're not delightful company.

06:11.765 --> 06:13.157
Isn't that Frank's wife?

06:13.935 --> 06:15.636
Dr. Winter!

06:15.670 --> 06:17.704
Dr. Winter?

06:20.606 --> 06:22.853
I hope this isn't a hanging crime.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.441
You can release the
prisoner into my custody.

06:25.475 --> 06:26.941
Sir, she's uncredentialed.

06:26.975 --> 06:30.642
She is a card-carrying member of
the Botanical Society of America.

06:30.677 --> 06:33.347
I will see that she
doesn't blow up any bridges.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.952
So what did you do to get sent upriver?

06:37.987 --> 06:40.524
I made an appointment
at the security office.

06:40.558 --> 06:42.525
You know, most of us spend our off hours

06:42.559 --> 06:44.026
avoiding the security office.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.498
I don't have off hours or on hours

06:46.533 --> 06:49.700
because I don't have a job
because the army won't let me.

06:49.735 --> 06:51.998
That doesn't sound so bad.

06:52.137 --> 06:54.153
If I had a six-month furlough,

06:54.209 --> 06:55.874
I'd catch up on my reading.

06:55.964 --> 06:58.870
I wasn't looking for an intelligence post.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.320
Apparently, I don't even have
clearance to laminate badges.

07:04.352 --> 07:07.207
They say I failed my polygraph.

07:07.658 --> 07:09.858
Did you tell them you
were thrilled to be here?

07:09.892 --> 07:12.025
Let me look into it.

07:13.427 --> 07:15.192
Don't bother.

07:16.298 --> 07:18.268
I stopped believing in Christmas miracles

07:18.302 --> 07:19.937
a long time ago.

07:25.873 --> 07:27.637
Abby, where are you going?

07:27.672 --> 07:29.138
I just punched out.

07:29.173 --> 07:30.974
I switched to the early shift.

07:31.009 --> 07:33.179
- Can you punch back in?
- What? No. No.

07:33.213 --> 07:34.816
I'm taking a day trip to Santa Fe.

07:34.851 --> 07:36.019
You can shop for pottery tomorrow.

07:36.044 --> 07:36.787
No, I can't.

07:36.821 --> 07:38.981
Santa Fe isn't going
anywhere. This is important.

07:41.531 --> 07:43.635
I'm not shopping.

07:43.669 --> 07:47.943
I know you won't approve, but
I'm going to see Mother and Daddy.

07:47.978 --> 07:49.991
Your parents live in Massachusetts.

07:50.016 --> 07:51.109
I got a letter.

07:51.144 --> 07:53.846
They're going to a millinery
convention in Los Angeles

07:53.880 --> 07:56.617
on the California Limited
and it stops in Santa Fe.

07:56.651 --> 07:59.119
- I'm going to surprise them.
- Jesus, Abby.

07:59.153 --> 08:01.323
I'm going to ride one stop, 72 minutes.

08:01.357 --> 08:04.094
And then I'll get off the train and
I'll take the bus back to Santa Fe.

08:04.129 --> 08:06.062
I know it's against the army rules

08:06.096 --> 08:07.698
and I know we could get into trouble...

08:07.732 --> 08:10.735
- Fine.
- Fine?

08:10.769 --> 08:13.469
But before you go, I need you to
arrange an outgoing telephone call.

08:14.403 --> 08:15.939
All right.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.611
With no one listening.

08:18.646 --> 08:20.381
Even you.

08:28.594 --> 08:30.964
Listen, stay away from him.

08:30.999 --> 08:34.635
No, Shirley, I'm not gonna
discuss this with you anymore.

08:36.573 --> 08:37.914
I don't want you standing under the

08:37.938 --> 08:39.078
- mistletoe...
- I need to cut in.

08:39.113 --> 08:40.330
- with that creep.
- I need to make

08:40.355 --> 08:41.515
a call from this telephone right now.

08:41.549 --> 08:44.518
Here. Here's $18. Buy
her a honey baked ham.

08:49.739 --> 08:51.025
Operator.

08:51.059 --> 08:53.765
Charles Isaacs. I need an outside line.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.329
Just a moment, please.

09:03.373 --> 09:05.099
Is this the reactor building?

09:05.443 --> 09:07.151
Put me through to Daniel Ellis' office.

09:07.176 --> 09:09.154
-  Hold for Mr. Ellis.
- No, no, no, no.

09:09.179 --> 09:12.351
No, I need to speak to
his secretary Theodore.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.754
Tell him it's Mr. Donaldson calling.

09:17.692 --> 09:19.318
Are you alone?

09:20.895 --> 09:22.730
Nobody's monitoring this call.

09:22.764 --> 09:24.621
We have exactly five minutes.

09:24.699 --> 09:27.867
There is something that
I need you to do for me.

09:30.521 --> 09:33.560
They don't look like they've
been ravaged by a light breeze,

09:33.585 --> 09:35.185
much less the Blitz.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.852
Englishmen never let a little thing

09:36.886 --> 09:38.753
like the apocalypse rumple our suits.

09:38.787 --> 09:42.424
Huh, this may be harder than I thought.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.930
Akley seems to have
quite a head start on us.

09:46.908 --> 09:48.501
Who's the ringleader?

09:48.535 --> 09:50.871
We get him, the rest
will fall like dominoes.

09:50.905 --> 09:53.675
The bloke with the
cigar is Philip Bantliff,

09:53.709 --> 09:57.277
but he barely got a second from
Cambridge in statistical mechanics.

09:57.311 --> 09:58.978
He can't balance an egg on a spoon,

09:59.013 --> 10:01.114
much less opposing thermodynamic forces.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.817
That's Brooks Matthews.

10:04.851 --> 10:07.485
He's a third-rate experimental hack.

10:07.519 --> 10:11.221
I'm sorry to say this, they sent
us Man United instead of Arsenal.

10:11.255 --> 10:13.216
Speak American.

10:13.789 --> 10:16.957
The A-team stayed home.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.961
What about him?

10:20.565 --> 10:22.196
We don't want him.

10:22.231 --> 10:24.332
- Who is he?
- His name is Hogarth.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.291
- Frank...
- William Hogarth?

10:27.681 --> 10:29.849
He started the British implosion project.

10:29.874 --> 10:33.043
He's the guy we need. You know him?

10:33.243 --> 10:35.510
We're acquainted, yeah.
But believe me, Frank...

10:35.545 --> 10:38.149
Well, good. We'll all have high tea.

10:42.418 --> 10:44.786
Can you show me your big
smile for Grandma and Grampy?

10:44.821 --> 10:48.124
Big smile. Big, big,
big. Look at that. Okay.

10:48.159 --> 10:50.459
Ready?

10:50.494 --> 10:53.159
No, we said no disturbances.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.576
It's a special delivery.

10:58.162 --> 11:00.196
Ta-da!

11:01.699 --> 11:02.867
- Abigail!
- Daddy, hi!

11:02.902 --> 11:05.489
What in God's name are you doing here?

11:06.405 --> 11:08.538
A month with barely a phone call,

11:08.572 --> 11:10.573
now you scare us half to death.

11:10.608 --> 11:12.939
- I'm so sorry.
- Come sit with your bubbe.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.374
You look beautiful, sweetheart.

11:14.408 --> 11:17.711
- Oh, such a boy.
- Have a seat.

11:19.081 --> 11:21.783
Have you had an easy trip?

11:31.527 --> 11:33.661
Joey, come here. Come here.

11:33.695 --> 11:35.596
Miriam.

11:35.630 --> 11:37.564
- Miriam.
- Come here.

11:37.599 --> 11:39.382
Miriam, it's okay.

11:39.934 --> 11:42.001
Dr. Hogarth.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.669
I'm Frank Winter.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.439
Glad you made it across the pond.

11:45.473 --> 11:48.341
Yes, Dr. Winter. Nice to
put a face to the reputation.

11:48.376 --> 11:49.908
Well, don't believe everything you hear.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.675
Oh, no, I've read your work.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.109
We're delighted to be here,

11:53.143 --> 11:54.978
to be anywhere other than there.

11:55.012 --> 11:56.650
I believe...

11:56.675 --> 11:59.416
I believe you know Paul Crosley.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.316
Dr. Hogarth.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.216
What a long time it has been, Paul.

12:06.321 --> 12:10.124
Ahem. Why don't we catch
up over dinner tonight?

12:10.811 --> 12:12.426
Lovely.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.676
You got a call at the switchboard, Chuck.

12:22.711 --> 12:24.234
Must have been a prank.

12:24.259 --> 12:25.816
Guy said he was Christopher Columbus.

12:25.841 --> 12:27.169
- Did he leave a message?
- Yeah,

12:27.194 --> 12:29.777
he said to tell you 400,000.

12:53.747 --> 12:55.249
Is he expecting you?

12:57.796 --> 12:59.563
Dr. Isaacs?

12:59.605 --> 13:01.342
It won't work.

13:02.416 --> 13:05.784
Thin Man. I just got a
message from Theodore Sinclair.

13:05.809 --> 13:07.376
- Who?
- It's not gonna work.

13:07.401 --> 13:10.003
Not with reactor-bred plutonium.

13:11.569 --> 13:13.070
Sit down. Sit down.

13:14.438 --> 13:16.103
Charlie,

13:16.138 --> 13:19.141
600 scientists vetted the math.

13:19.176 --> 13:21.278
Four of them have Nobel medals at home.

13:21.312 --> 13:24.112
But their numbers don't
account for reactor plutonium.

13:24.147 --> 13:26.550
It's not pure. It contains Pu-240.

13:26.585 --> 13:28.454
We'll survive a little cork in our wine.

13:28.488 --> 13:29.688
I read a paper once.

13:29.723 --> 13:31.957
It theorized that even-numbered isotopes

13:31.991 --> 13:34.258
have higher spontaneous
fission rates than odd.

13:34.293 --> 13:36.160
- Whose paper?
- So I got Sinclair

13:36.194 --> 13:37.995
to test a sample from the reactor.

13:38.029 --> 13:40.297
As long as it's under 300, we're fine.

13:40.332 --> 13:42.832
It's 400,000.

13:50.437 --> 13:52.066
It'll predetonate

13:52.703 --> 13:54.557
like a bad fuse.

14:03.416 --> 14:05.417
Why did you tell me?

14:06.519 --> 14:08.053
Um, what?

14:10.456 --> 14:12.448
Let's be honest with each other.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.329
You don't really want the
project to succeed, do you?

14:15.363 --> 14:17.696
I mean, you made that pretty clear
since the moment you got here.

14:17.730 --> 14:20.129
So why did you tell me?

14:20.164 --> 14:21.830
It's my job. I made a commitment.

14:21.865 --> 14:23.499
There are higher commitments.

14:23.534 --> 14:26.201
You could have sat back, stayed
quiet, watched Thin Man fail.

14:26.235 --> 14:28.501
And let Heisenberg beat us to the punch?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.735
If we fall short with
the combined brain power

14:31.770 --> 14:34.003
of all the Allies and a
floating line of credit

14:34.037 --> 14:35.971
from the United States government,

14:36.005 --> 14:38.072
isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg

14:38.107 --> 14:40.207
-  will fall short, too?
- Of course.

14:40.242 --> 14:44.580
And if we fail and Heisenberg
fails, it'll never get built.

14:44.614 --> 14:46.580
We could all go home.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.396
You could have kept quiet.

14:50.786 --> 14:52.720
But instead...

14:53.989 --> 14:57.930
you walked into my office
and you sounded the alarm.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.207
I thought you should know.

15:01.232 --> 15:03.166
And now I do.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.370
And now we'll reorganize

15:05.405 --> 15:08.738
all of our resources
toward finding a solution.

15:08.773 --> 15:10.743
And when we do drop the bomb...

15:10.777 --> 15:14.280
and make no mistake, we will drop it...

15:14.305 --> 15:16.474
all those lives

15:16.499 --> 15:19.001
will be on your head, Charlie.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.884
But now I know

15:22.356 --> 15:25.359
that 20 centuries of stony sleep

15:25.393 --> 15:28.797
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle.

15:28.831 --> 15:33.069
And what rough beast, its
hour come round at last,

15:33.104 --> 15:36.372
slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

15:36.406 --> 15:37.530
- Sir?
- You should have

15:37.555 --> 15:38.608
kept your mouth shut,

15:38.643 --> 15:41.818
you goddamn, ungrateful,
conniving little Jew.

15:42.181 --> 15:44.648
Dr. Isaacs?

15:48.254 --> 15:49.924
Never mind.

15:50.523 --> 15:52.359
It can wait.

15:57.896 --> 16:00.332
So this is Aunt Esther's family?

16:00.367 --> 16:02.168
Esther's on my side, sweetheart.

16:02.203 --> 16:05.306
The Perlmans are your
mother's cousins back in Minsk.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.841
The ones with the textile factory?

16:07.876 --> 16:09.610
We thought they'd all made it out,

16:09.645 --> 16:13.011
but that letter arrived
just before we left home.

16:13.046 --> 16:15.182
Malka and the little girl...

16:15.217 --> 16:16.819
got left behind.

16:16.854 --> 16:19.454
The postmark was from June.

16:19.489 --> 16:23.121
Now they say the whole
ghetto has been liquidated.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.589
What kind of word is that?

16:24.623 --> 16:26.392
It's like a sale at Filene's.

16:26.426 --> 16:28.760
What were they doing in
the ghetto to begin with?

16:28.795 --> 16:30.461
Aren't they very well-to-do?

16:30.496 --> 16:31.885
Ah!

16:32.164 --> 16:34.665
We've called half of Washington
trying to get information.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.902
You're always warning me
about jumping to conclusions.

16:37.936 --> 16:40.672
I'm sure your cousins will
turn up sooner or later.

16:40.706 --> 16:43.106
Probably in a shallow grave.

16:45.441 --> 16:47.312
Little corn has big ears.

16:47.346 --> 16:48.880
I hope he's listening.

16:48.915 --> 16:50.851
Children need to know
what kind of world this is

16:50.885 --> 16:53.021
that treats good Jews like poultry.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.921
Your father sheltered you too much.

16:54.955 --> 16:56.354
Now let it go, Miriam.

16:56.389 --> 16:58.157
You could never stand any ugliness.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.326
Forgive me if I'm not
interested in gloomy gossip

17:00.360 --> 17:01.696
about people I've never even met.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.868
You haven't seen me or Joey in six months

17:03.902 --> 17:05.672
and this is how you want
to spend our time together?

17:05.705 --> 17:08.473
Now it's our fault that
we haven't seen you?

17:19.285 --> 17:21.739
Joey's going to be in a holiday pageant.

17:22.189 --> 17:25.347
He's playing the little lamb in the manger.

17:27.090 --> 17:29.428
He's Jewish, Abigail.

17:29.462 --> 17:31.298
Well, so was Jesus.

17:31.332 --> 17:33.699
And I know you won't believe it, Daddy,

17:33.733 --> 17:36.436
but Charlie's been an
absolute star at work.

17:36.471 --> 17:38.606
And what is his work exactly?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.743
You know I can't talk about it.

17:41.778 --> 17:43.680
But a lot of very smart
and important people

17:43.716 --> 17:46.754
seem to think that Charlie
is going to help end the war.

17:47.956 --> 17:50.992
Maybe Charlie can help us.

17:52.495 --> 17:55.183
He's got such an important government job,

17:55.601 --> 17:59.735
maybe he can find out
where they've sent Malka.

17:59.770 --> 18:02.807
Arrange some kind of special
visa, I don't know what.

18:02.842 --> 18:04.746
- No.
- We'll pay whatever it costs.

18:04.780 --> 18:08.617
My love, my love, there is
nothing that Charlie can do.

18:15.028 --> 18:18.063
We've got 18 minutes till Albuquerque.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.900
What, you're getting off?

18:21.968 --> 18:25.005
We have a suite at the
Huntington in Pasadena.

18:25.702 --> 18:27.142
Daddy...

18:28.811 --> 18:31.542
I don't know. If... if
they even knew I was here...

18:32.016 --> 18:35.317
Open up, please.

18:40.756 --> 18:43.859
Mrs. Isaacs, would you please come with me?

18:45.162 --> 18:46.864
Now.

18:51.326 --> 18:54.164
Mrs. Isaacs, this is a serious infraction.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.324
I would think a switchboard operator

18:56.370 --> 18:58.471
would know security
regulations chapter and verse.

18:58.506 --> 18:59.971
Absolutely, sir. I do.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.605
Well, then you see my confusion.

19:01.639 --> 19:04.074
A day pass to Santa Fe is
not a ticket to California.

19:04.108 --> 19:06.542
I wasn't going to California,
sir. Just to Albuquerque.

19:06.576 --> 19:08.300
Mrs. Isaacs,

19:09.212 --> 19:11.346
if you and your husband are
having a marital dispute...

19:11.380 --> 19:13.380
No, it's nothing like that, sir.

19:13.415 --> 19:15.214
Colonel Cox...

19:17.449 --> 19:19.984
There has been...

19:20.019 --> 19:22.186
there has been a terrible tragedy.

19:25.023 --> 19:27.750
I don't know if you heard
what happened in Minsk.

19:28.193 --> 19:29.661
I have family there

19:29.686 --> 19:32.422
and my cousin Malka...

19:32.537 --> 19:35.508
well, she's really more
like a sister to me.

19:35.972 --> 19:38.240
Now, now.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.924
Oh.

19:47.488 --> 19:49.955
I know it was wrong,
sneaking off like that,

19:49.989 --> 19:52.190
but I was trying to help my
family through a difficult time

19:52.224 --> 19:53.891
and I'm prepared to accept my punishment.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.357
- There have to be consequences.
- Oh, poor Malka.

19:56.391 --> 19:58.522
I used to send her
hand-me-downs every year.

19:58.557 --> 20:02.057
I guess there's no need for those
dresses wherever the Nazis have taken her.

20:02.092 --> 20:03.793
It's just so hard not knowing.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.816
- If only we had some answers.
- All right. All right, listen.

20:07.187 --> 20:08.855
Given the circumstances,

20:08.880 --> 20:11.349
I think we can let bygones be bygones.

20:16.971 --> 20:19.007
Go home and get some rest, Mrs. Isaacs.

20:21.112 --> 20:23.047
Thank you, sir.

20:32.818 --> 20:34.655
Three-martini lunch?

20:34.689 --> 20:36.824
Principal wants to see you in his office.

20:50.837 --> 20:52.437
The St. Louis Kid.

20:55.943 --> 20:58.878
We missed you today at
lunch with the Brits.

20:58.912 --> 21:00.144
Lunatics.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.047
You all right?

21:05.686 --> 21:08.353
You look like you just saw
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

21:09.689 --> 21:11.524
I think I'm coming down with something.

21:11.558 --> 21:15.192
I used to get the flu every winter recess.

21:16.728 --> 21:18.146
Here.

21:19.429 --> 21:21.064
Kills the germs.

21:22.399 --> 21:23.966
You wanted to see me, sir?

21:27.270 --> 21:30.022
You know what I do for a living, Charlie?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.106
I'm in upper management.

21:32.141 --> 21:35.610
I spent 15 years at a university

21:35.644 --> 21:37.411
dreaming about invisible particles,

21:37.445 --> 21:39.342
and suddenly they handed me the keys

21:39.653 --> 21:41.187
to a world war.

21:43.049 --> 21:44.547
Explain that.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.755
There's gonna be some changes around here.

21:49.849 --> 21:51.717
'Cause the Brits are joining Thin Man?

21:51.751 --> 21:55.187
No, this is bigger than a bunch
of shell-shocked theoretical men.

21:55.221 --> 21:56.888
Now that the reactor's up and running,

21:56.922 --> 21:58.925
I'm gonna be back and
forth between Chicago,

21:58.959 --> 22:01.598
DC, God knows where else.

22:01.632 --> 22:04.967
We're through designing.
It's time to build.

22:05.001 --> 22:06.941
The design is locked?

22:07.027 --> 22:08.872
Now, I know that you've
had your differences

22:08.906 --> 22:11.640
with some of the rest of the
group, Lancefield in particular.

22:11.674 --> 22:13.308
That's gonna have to change.

22:13.342 --> 22:15.312
I'm appointing a number two

22:15.346 --> 22:18.049
to mind the shop, get the Brits
up to speed while I'm away.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.219
Now I mentored Tom Lancefield in Chicago

22:20.253 --> 22:22.723
and have watched him become a
fine physicist in his own right.

22:22.757 --> 22:23.868
He's the natural choice.

22:23.893 --> 22:25.651
But he's not my choice, Charlie.

22:26.767 --> 22:28.366
You are.

22:29.981 --> 22:31.442
Sir?

22:32.434 --> 22:34.570
Promise me you're gonna
work on your people skills

22:34.604 --> 22:36.661
or you'll wind up like Frank Winter.

22:37.366 --> 22:40.179
Don't get your hopes up. Title
doesn't come with a raise.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.745
I'm not sure what to say.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.978
Well, say that you won't make me look bad

22:45.013 --> 22:47.116
in front of the President
of the United States.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.684
You have your hand on the rudder.

22:49.718 --> 22:52.385
A staff of 600 at your beck and call.

22:56.951 --> 22:58.984
You just got a promotion.

22:59.019 --> 23:01.020
It wouldn't kill you to smile.

23:06.293 --> 23:07.794
Can I think about it?

23:09.736 --> 23:12.202
I'm not sure I'm management material.

23:16.793 --> 23:21.098
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of this waffling, Charlie.

23:21.219 --> 23:24.277
Desperate times require men of conviction.

23:25.348 --> 23:28.050
You have till tomorrow to
decide if you're one of them.

23:31.788 --> 23:35.226
They say he was antisocial

23:35.260 --> 23:36.694
and knew nothing about people.

23:36.729 --> 23:38.362
Typical of a Cambridge man.

23:38.397 --> 23:39.930
He did die a virgin, after all.

23:42.366 --> 23:45.269
But I've always believed Isaac Newton

23:45.303 --> 23:47.638
to be a humanist in his way.

23:47.672 --> 23:50.744
The law of universal
gravitation applies to men

23:50.779 --> 23:52.445
just as to objects.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.780
Consider the two of us.

23:53.814 --> 23:56.415
Oh, yes. Quite a coincidence.

23:56.449 --> 23:58.551
Mmm, oh, no, Paul.

23:58.585 --> 24:01.555
You and I after so many years
have been drawn together once more

24:01.590 --> 24:03.791
by the cosmos for a reason.

24:03.825 --> 24:08.393
Dr. Akley plied me with an 1896 Margaux

24:08.427 --> 24:11.594
which he'd been holding in his
collection since before the war.

24:11.629 --> 24:13.863
But then, that's mere table wine

24:13.897 --> 24:16.554
in Lord Crosley's cellar, isn't it?

24:16.810 --> 24:18.509
Lord Crosley?

24:18.965 --> 24:21.301
He didn't tell you?

24:23.070 --> 24:26.437
George III deeded his great grandfather

24:26.471 --> 24:29.808
more land in Mayfair than
the Duke of Westminster.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.143
A bit of an exaggeration.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.878
Oh, please, a few well-placed fire bombs

24:33.912 --> 24:36.717
and your man here is sitting
on the throne, Dr. Winter.

24:36.752 --> 24:39.156
I'll make sure and curtsey.

24:40.723 --> 24:42.458
Ah.

24:42.492 --> 24:44.726
Bring us the sweetest,

24:44.761 --> 24:47.915
wettest bottle you have, love.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.330
And let me know if you'd like me

24:50.364 --> 24:52.914
to go down in your cellar to pick it out.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.168
We have a very limited list, sir.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.300
But I'll bring you the check.

24:57.334 --> 24:58.835
Put it on Paul's tab.

25:00.806 --> 25:04.304
Paul joined you at the
National Physical Lab

25:04.338 --> 25:06.307
after Oxford, correct?

25:06.341 --> 25:07.575
First in his class.

25:07.609 --> 25:09.675
How could I have turned him down?

25:09.709 --> 25:14.082
His work was excellent, but his company

25:14.116 --> 25:16.417
was beyond compare.

25:16.451 --> 25:19.319
He used to regale my
wife and family with tales

25:19.353 --> 25:22.592
about, what was it, Woburn Abbey?

25:24.227 --> 25:27.028
You recall all those
Christmases you spent with us?

25:27.063 --> 25:30.199
Still cleaning the foie
gras out of my arteries.

25:30.234 --> 25:32.232
- How is Mrs. Hogarth?
- Dead.

25:34.737 --> 25:36.105
My condolences.

25:36.140 --> 25:39.110
There was a time when I hoped

25:39.144 --> 25:41.178
Crosley would take a shine to my daughter.

25:41.212 --> 25:43.581
Do you think maybe we should
call it a night, gentlemen?

25:43.616 --> 25:45.284
I, um... we have an early start.

25:45.318 --> 25:47.884
Uh, a night cap.

25:48.523 --> 25:51.467
There are a few things we
should discuss with Dr. Hogarth.

25:51.492 --> 25:53.763
Perhaps Lord Crosley's right.

25:53.797 --> 25:56.532
I have an 8:00 meeting with
Dr. Akley I should prepare for.

25:56.567 --> 25:57.766
One drink.

26:03.241 --> 26:04.935
Dr. Hogarth,

26:05.976 --> 26:09.010
I'd like to talk to you
about your work on implosion.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.380
I enjoyed getting to know
the Thin Man team today.

26:17.031 --> 26:19.449
But it's been a long winter

26:19.483 --> 26:21.750
for a lonely widower in Europe.

26:22.777 --> 26:24.375
And there's one comfort

26:24.456 --> 26:27.090
Akley declined to point me towards.

26:38.176 --> 26:42.313
Sit back and relax. There
are no wrong answers.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.617
Stanley Church.

26:58.545 --> 27:00.213
Do I know you?

27:00.489 --> 27:02.689
You interviewed a woman
maybe nine months back.

27:02.724 --> 27:04.857
Liza Winter. Denied her clearance.

27:04.892 --> 27:07.627
I'm prohibited from
discussing security procedures.

27:07.662 --> 27:09.062
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

27:09.097 --> 27:10.197
Look, I wouldn't bother you,

27:10.231 --> 27:12.300
but this is a good woman
with something to offer.

27:12.334 --> 27:15.146
I think you've made a
recommendation in error.

27:15.171 --> 27:17.406
I don't make recommendations.

27:17.507 --> 27:19.540
I interpret physiological data

27:19.575 --> 27:21.541
and pass the findings on to my superiors.

27:21.576 --> 27:23.941
You've never passed along a false positive?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.942
If you'll excuse me, I have to get home.

27:25.976 --> 27:27.313
What for?

27:27.523 --> 27:30.923
Not like you have a
wife waiting up for you.

27:31.146 --> 27:32.695
I'm sorry?

27:33.114 --> 27:35.146
We have an acquaintance in common.

27:35.179 --> 27:39.181
Corporal Hayden from the ordnance division.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.217
He mentioned you a while back.

27:42.251 --> 27:44.274
Thought we'd have a lot to talk about.

27:44.651 --> 27:47.786
A couple of middle-aged bachelors.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.321
I'm not sure of what you're implying.

27:50.355 --> 27:53.982
I think we're all entitled
to a secret or two, don't you?

27:54.623 --> 27:57.394
Now listen, you do me a favor.

27:57.428 --> 27:59.562
Pull Liza Winter's file,

27:59.596 --> 28:02.031
give that physiological data a second look.

28:02.065 --> 28:03.867
I don't know what you
think she lied about...

28:03.901 --> 28:06.904
She registered a fail on question 17.

28:06.939 --> 28:08.974
What's question 17?

28:09.008 --> 28:12.213
Have you ever received treatment
or been institutionalized

28:12.248 --> 28:14.350
due to a disorder of the mind?

28:34.033 --> 28:35.835
How are your mother and

28:35.869 --> 28:38.574
his highness the hat king?

28:40.211 --> 28:42.973
Still trying to shake
me from the family tree?

28:43.384 --> 28:45.072
They're good.

28:47.929 --> 28:49.963
How was work?

28:51.811 --> 28:53.581
Good.

29:01.213 --> 29:04.284
Be 1960 before these noodles cook.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.361
You're a nasty Yankee whore, aren't you?

29:15.395 --> 29:18.670
Sounds like he'll make a
great addition to the team.

29:18.695 --> 29:21.898
Better have a suitcase full of
super-compression calculations for us.

29:21.923 --> 29:24.226
Well, if he's been working
on implosion for 18 months,

29:24.251 --> 29:26.370
I bet he's got designs
for a working model by now.

29:27.496 --> 29:29.436
- All right, that's it. I've heard enough.

29:29.521 --> 29:32.581
You let me know when Big Ben strikes 12.

29:35.052 --> 29:38.054
Americans. So delicate.

29:43.467 --> 29:45.368
Pussy got your tongue?

29:49.184 --> 29:50.921
Bring me another.

29:50.946 --> 29:53.349
I'm having such a delightful time

29:53.374 --> 29:55.208
with the implosion group tonight.

29:55.233 --> 29:58.434
And Lord Crosley will
happily pay, won't you?

30:09.191 --> 30:12.660
Not exactly Suleiman's harem, is it?

30:13.796 --> 30:16.534
This is the entire menu?

30:16.975 --> 30:19.975
What a wholesome and
unsullied creature you are.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.063
Thank you.

30:21.088 --> 30:23.597
Let us correct that immediately.

30:25.334 --> 30:26.932
Isn't that Fritz's lady friend?

30:26.967 --> 30:28.523
Jeannie.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.834
Poor Fritz.

30:33.237 --> 30:34.770
I'm going.

30:36.905 --> 30:39.041
Perhaps the three of us

30:39.075 --> 30:40.610
could get along together.

30:40.645 --> 30:42.879
Experience...

30:42.913 --> 30:44.479
Not her.

30:44.514 --> 30:47.448
- You can't have Jeannie.
- I'm working, Crosley.

30:47.482 --> 30:50.951
In your presence, Paul, I believe
I can have anything I want.

30:52.687 --> 30:54.655
Not her.

30:54.689 --> 30:57.859
Here, Jeannie, take this,
please. Take the night off.

30:57.893 --> 30:59.961
The slave would do well
not to poke at the lion.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.102
Oh!

31:09.541 --> 31:12.075
She named him Henry, by the way.

31:12.109 --> 31:15.542
Wanted your son to have a decent
name before she gave him away.

31:15.577 --> 31:18.111
Little Henry never did
have a title, did he?

31:18.146 --> 31:20.646
What was your father's again, Paul?

31:20.680 --> 31:23.548
Best ironmonger in Liverpool?

31:23.582 --> 31:27.017
Does that pass to a child out of wedlock?

31:28.554 --> 31:30.989
Lucy thought you'd return eventually.

31:31.023 --> 31:35.325
But I should have known you'd
wash up on American shores.

31:35.359 --> 31:37.227
What's the problem here?

31:37.262 --> 31:40.702
Your man is a confidence artist, Frank.

31:40.736 --> 31:42.604
He conned my daughter

31:42.638 --> 31:45.239
into believing he was a
thousand things he isn't,

31:45.274 --> 31:47.942
most importantly that
he was the kind of man

31:47.976 --> 31:51.707
who doesn't flee England
when he fathers a child.

31:54.043 --> 31:56.345
All right, night's over.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.645
You can both settle this when you're sober.

31:58.679 --> 32:00.948
No, no, no. This is just fine.

32:00.982 --> 32:03.351
Oh, and by the way, Dr. Winter,

32:03.385 --> 32:05.951
no one from the delegation
is joining your group.

32:05.985 --> 32:07.453
Not one of the men.

32:07.487 --> 32:09.376
Dr. Hogarth, please.

32:10.092 --> 32:12.224
Whatever my mistakes, you
lived through the bombings.

32:12.259 --> 32:14.658
You know implosion is the way
forward. You have to help us.

32:14.692 --> 32:15.806
- No, I do not.
- You would

32:15.831 --> 32:16.961
let Hitler win this war...

32:16.995 --> 32:21.398
No, I do not know implosion
is the way forward.

32:21.433 --> 32:24.267
It's a fantasy. A dream.

32:24.302 --> 32:27.974
Not with super-compression
and a solid sphere.

32:28.008 --> 32:30.743
We are just months away
from a fully functioning...

32:30.777 --> 32:33.647
Theory which we've already disproved.

32:34.937 --> 32:37.327
If you spent more time working,
less time groping army girls...

32:38.721 --> 32:41.424
There's that American hubris.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.502
My Christmas gift to you...
I'll send over our research.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.561
When you examine our papers,

32:46.595 --> 32:48.898
you'll find that shockwave control

32:48.932 --> 32:51.169
is mathematically impossible.

32:51.203 --> 32:54.238
I imagine you're already
fighting with propagation.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.179
Soon you'll see that chaos is untamable.

32:57.213 --> 33:00.047
Implosion is like a man.

33:00.081 --> 33:02.182
The closer you look,
the more you'll realize

33:02.216 --> 33:03.918
just how little you know about him.

33:03.953 --> 33:08.458
Even if your group weren't full
of misfits and liars, Dr. Winter,

33:08.492 --> 33:12.028
a thousand geniuses
couldn't master implosion

33:12.062 --> 33:13.896
in a thousand millennia.

33:17.199 --> 33:19.034
Get this limey prick out of here.

33:51.929 --> 33:54.463
So, you traded away the afternoon shift?

33:54.488 --> 33:56.001
- Mmm.
- I thought you and Frenchy

33:56.026 --> 33:57.586
were attached at the hip.

33:59.394 --> 34:01.161
I prefer to spend afternoons with my son.

34:01.195 --> 34:05.767
Well, she asked me to
give this back to you.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.440
Dr. Hogarth is right about me.

34:54.746 --> 34:56.779
None of that's my business.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.910
Doesn't mean he's right about implosion.

35:05.585 --> 35:07.652
Just because they couldn't do it, Frank,

35:07.686 --> 35:09.453
doesn't mean you can't.

35:09.487 --> 35:12.920
The problem with us Brits, we
are too beholden to our past.

35:12.955 --> 35:16.189
You Americans, you barely have
one, so it can't hold you back.

35:16.224 --> 35:19.863
There's a reason you invented
things like motor cars and airplanes.

35:21.666 --> 35:23.631
Hubris cuts both ways, Frank.

35:24.768 --> 35:26.937
But it doesn't control shockwaves.

35:26.971 --> 35:29.774
Hogarth sent over his papers this morning.

35:34.350 --> 35:38.788
You know, there's a boy
out there somewhere and...

35:41.691 --> 35:43.158
I'm a part of him.

35:43.192 --> 35:45.156
Or he's a part of me.

35:47.726 --> 35:50.894
I thought I had spent the last two years

35:50.929 --> 35:53.695
trying to pretend he didn't exist.

35:55.163 --> 35:57.900
Maybe... maybe...

35:57.934 --> 35:59.804
it's knowing that he does exist

35:59.839 --> 36:03.343
is what brought me here in the first place.

36:05.446 --> 36:08.080
I know I'll probably never meet him and...

36:08.114 --> 36:10.614
well, if I did, he'd probably hate me.

36:10.648 --> 36:12.351
But...

36:14.288 --> 36:16.754
I don't know.

36:16.788 --> 36:20.789
I suppose I still want to make him proud.

36:57.836 --> 36:59.102
Oh.

36:59.136 --> 37:00.601
Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.102
So much for bygones.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.172
If you're here to arrest me,
I'm going to have to resist.

37:04.206 --> 37:05.775
My son's asleep and I don't have a sitter.

37:05.809 --> 37:08.113
No, ma'am. The colonel
doesn't know I'm here.

37:08.148 --> 37:09.882
May I come in?

37:21.633 --> 37:23.400
How can I help you, Private?

37:23.435 --> 37:26.070
Cole Dunlavey.

37:28.274 --> 37:30.646
I knew a Jewish fella back in Iowa.

37:30.681 --> 37:34.551
Mr. Kripke. Used to hire me to
paint his fence every summer.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.190
Paid me $10 just for a day's work.

37:38.224 --> 37:41.563
When my dad got sick, Mr. Kripke
helped us get the crop in the silo.

37:41.597 --> 37:44.930
Well, he sounds like a lovely man.

37:46.764 --> 37:50.268
I don't like to eavesdrop, but I heard
your conversation with the colonel.

37:50.303 --> 37:53.037
I know how important family
is in the Hebrew faith.

37:53.072 --> 37:54.705
Mmm.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.311
I file the intelligence reports.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.809
This is everything we have on the
situation where your people are.

38:01.843 --> 38:04.544
You said that not knowing
was the hardest part.

38:06.214 --> 38:08.016
Mmm.

38:12.653 --> 38:16.390
The Bible says that the Lord
rained fire on Sodom and Gomorrah.

38:18.224 --> 38:20.458
I don't know what He's
gonna rain on Berlin.

38:33.809 --> 38:36.478
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:36.512 --> 38:38.946
Are you putting an addition on the house?

38:38.980 --> 38:41.345
Frank had them drawn up last year

38:41.379 --> 38:43.244
as a Christmas gift.

38:43.681 --> 38:46.051
Plans for a greenhouse back in Princeton.

38:46.086 --> 38:49.154
A woman must have money
and a room of her own.

38:49.189 --> 38:51.522
I have my shack.

38:51.556 --> 38:54.393
But I've given up on the paycheck.

38:54.427 --> 38:56.229
Frank's not here.

38:56.263 --> 38:58.596
Yeah, I just left him at the office.

38:58.631 --> 39:00.161
But about that paycheck,

39:01.135 --> 39:03.740
you can pick up your
security badge in the morning.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.576
They'll find you a job.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.780
The whole thing was
just a misunderstanding.

39:10.150 --> 39:11.750
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:11.785 --> 39:14.820
It turns out the polygraph
machine was on the fritz that day.

39:15.393 --> 39:18.042
You didn't have to do that, Glen.

39:19.789 --> 39:21.823
In fact, I...

39:21.857 --> 39:23.858
I asked you not to.

39:25.493 --> 39:28.029
Did they show you my file?

39:29.098 --> 39:30.864
It's none of my business.

39:32.832 --> 39:34.317
I see.

39:35.389 --> 39:37.704
You're all right now.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.542
Aren't you?

39:43.316 --> 39:46.620
If I had known, I would never
have brought Frank into this.

39:46.654 --> 39:49.022
I never would have dragged
you to the middle of nowhere.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.343
Yes, you would have.

39:51.993 --> 39:54.629
Frank knew and here we are.

39:54.663 --> 39:57.131
But I'll take the job. Thank you.

39:57.166 --> 39:58.853
Because...

40:00.303 --> 40:02.504
here we are.

40:19.256 --> 40:21.558
Did you eat already?

40:24.229 --> 40:26.229
My cousins are dead.

40:26.263 --> 40:28.397
What?

40:30.668 --> 40:33.207
The Perlmans on my mother's side.

40:33.940 --> 40:35.776
Jesus.

40:36.276 --> 40:38.277
I'm sorry.

40:39.882 --> 40:41.752
Were you close?

40:43.487 --> 40:45.386
No, I never met them.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.020
If I had seen them on the street,

40:47.055 --> 40:49.091
I would have walked right past.

40:52.630 --> 40:54.430
Were they in an accident or...

40:54.464 --> 40:57.601
No, they... they were in Europe.

40:59.755 --> 41:02.857
I... I don't see how
they could have escaped

41:03.243 --> 41:04.977
with a toddler.

41:10.685 --> 41:13.189
Did you know that in Minsk

41:13.223 --> 41:15.292
the Germans allot each Jew

41:15.326 --> 41:18.754
one and a half square
meters of living space?

41:19.530 --> 41:21.298
The adults, I mean.

41:21.332 --> 41:24.300
The children were marched into the forest

41:24.335 --> 41:26.235
and buried alive.

41:27.870 --> 41:29.736
Where'd you hear that?

41:32.639 --> 41:35.039
There are more than a
million people missing.

41:37.508 --> 41:40.506
Like they just vanished
off the face of the earth.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.510
I don't even know how to
think about a number like that.

41:46.282 --> 41:49.016
You shouldn't be thinking
about that stuff, Abby.

41:49.050 --> 41:50.917
Why?

41:50.951 --> 41:53.118
Because I'm too fragile
to stomach the truth?

41:53.152 --> 41:56.692
No, because there's no
point getting worked up

41:56.726 --> 41:59.061
when there's nothing you can do about it.

42:04.871 --> 42:06.904
What did Dr. Akley say?

42:06.938 --> 42:08.446
About the problem.

42:09.072 --> 42:10.875
What problem?

42:10.909 --> 42:13.812
Whatever you were talking about
with that man in Tennessee.

42:13.847 --> 42:15.688
You listened in on the call?

42:15.713 --> 42:16.725
Charlie, if something's wrong...

42:16.750 --> 42:20.085
Everything's fine. Whatever
you heard, forget it.

42:22.554 --> 42:24.489
You're right.

42:28.027 --> 42:29.528
You're right.

42:29.562 --> 42:32.098
I can't do anything about
what's happening over there.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.068
But you can.

43:11.102 --> 43:12.865
_

44:35.214 --> 44:37.411
There's something I need to tell you.

44:38.812 --> 44:40.945
There's a problem with Thin Man.

44:42.181 --> 44:44.217
What?

44:44.252 --> 44:47.952
The spontaneous fission
rates of plutonium-240,

44:47.987 --> 44:49.787
they're higher than 239.

44:49.821 --> 44:52.222
Rates are always higher
in even-numbered isotopes.

44:52.256 --> 44:54.589
I know. You wrote a paper about it.

44:54.624 --> 44:57.858
I told you I read everything
you ever published.

44:57.893 --> 45:01.094
It's 400,000.

45:04.264 --> 45:06.932
Akley's bomb will predetonate.

45:06.967 --> 45:09.000
We're dead in the water.

45:11.636 --> 45:13.638
We are, too.

45:13.672 --> 45:15.874
What?

45:15.908 --> 45:18.486
Implosion won't work either.

45:19.144 --> 45:22.113
Not without an army of scientists.

45:33.130 --> 45:35.399
So what are we going to do about it?
