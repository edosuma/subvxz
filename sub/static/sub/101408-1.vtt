10:47.375 --> 10:48.916
We find our strength. Yes.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I know.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.500
You've told me a thousand times, but...

10:54.583 --> 10:56.750
But you've also told me
to stay true to myself.

10:56.833 --> 10:57.666
Yes.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.166
And...

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
-And now you're asking me to lie.
-I'm not asking you to lie.

11:03.791 --> 11:04.833
It happened, Dad.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.500
I...

11:07.666 --> 11:08.500
OK.

11:09.041 --> 11:09.875
OK.

11:10.541 --> 11:11.666
I'm telling you the truth.

11:14.000 --> 11:14.833
Good night.

11:15.791 --> 11:16.791
I love you.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.333
If you don't like that lotion,
I have another that--

11:19.416 --> 11:20.666
Dad, just... God!

11:26.750 --> 11:28.625
-He still believes it happened.
-OK.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.291
-So, we're gonna do this.
-Mm-hmm.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.375
-Tomorrow.
-Yes.

at lunch tomorrow...

11:41.666 --> 11:43.500
Cole, come on. You're gonna be late.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.208
I can't find my lit paper anywhere!

11:46.625 --> 11:48.833
-[Dad] Did you check up your butt?
-Where?

11:48.916 --> 11:50.958

I have no idea, man.

12:05.916 --> 12:07.458
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

12:08.666 --> 12:10.541
-[Dad] Do you wanna drive?
-[Cole] No.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.750
[Dad] All right. I don't want to either,
but I'll do it.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.208
-[Cole] Melanie.
-What's up?

12:14.291 --> 12:16.708
-They're sending me away. Today.
-What? Let me see.

What?

12:19.083 --> 12:19.916
No.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.791
It's not you.
It's this place that's making you crazy.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.125
You need to get out of here.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.458
I mean, you need to get out of town,
clear your head.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.583
We're all going to the lake this weekend.
Just come with me. I'm leaving at lunch.

12:33.666 --> 12:36.875
-My parents would never let me do that.
-You're not gonna ask your parents,

12:36.958 --> 12:38.833
just like I'm not gonna ask my dad.

12:38.916 --> 12:41.458
And I already took his car, so...

12:41.916 --> 12:43.041
You took your dad's car?

12:44.666 --> 12:47.833
I don't know. I don't think
that's a good idea, because--

12:50.583 --> 12:51.416
[Cole] Uh...

12:51.833 --> 12:53.500
They're to make me less anxious,

12:53.583 --> 12:55.958
but they just kinda make me feel
like somebody else.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.083
And I pass out.

12:57.916 --> 13:02.666
It's no big deal.
I mean, everyone is on some shit.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.333

to try and live our best life.

if she steps on a crack,

13:28.625 --> 13:30.583
she thinks her uterus is gonna explode.

13:30.666 --> 13:33.125
No!

13:33.458 --> 13:34.708

What's she on?

Hey, girl.
You going to the lake this weekend?

13:44.250 --> 13:46.541
Oh yeah. I can't wait to finger you.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.375
[Melanie] Unclear, but...

13:51.166 --> 13:52.791
I heard she killed her parents.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.791
-Seriously? Where'd you hear that?
-Like, everywhere.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.375
Can you imagine what kinda psycho
you'd have to be to butcher your parents?

15:07.458 --> 15:09.666
Um, I think that, uh...

15:10.791 --> 15:11.791
It means that...

15:12.958 --> 15:14.583
taking shortcuts is a cop-out.

15:14.666 --> 15:19.166
And getting something without actually
working for it is ultimately unrewarding.

Yeah! Let's fuck him.

30:39.291 --> 30:40.416
What?

30:43.083 --> 30:44.791
-Up.
-Yeah!

30:45.750 --> 30:48.583
[Allison] Let's do it! Fuck him up hard.

30:49.666 --> 30:50.625
Why?

30:50.708 --> 30:52.916
-You know I wanna be an influencer.
-[scoffs]

30:53.000 --> 30:55.708
OK, enough chitchat.
You bring anything to tie him up with?

30:55.791 --> 30:56.791
Sure did, bro.

30:58.666 --> 31:00.833
Great. What the fuck is this?

31:00.916 --> 31:03.750
Jimmy, you were supposed to go to
the hardware store, you fucking idiot.

31:03.833 --> 31:06.833
Yeah, but there's a crafting store
so much closer to my house.

31:06.916 --> 31:09.416
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why are we tying him up?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.583
-Why can't we just kill him?
-[panting]

31:11.666 --> 31:13.208
-[Max] Let's go!
-[Allison] Oh yeah!

31:13.291 --> 31:16.833
Come, come, come on.
Wait. Whoa. Hold on. Hey! Ha!

31:16.916 --> 31:20.083
-Stop. Hammer time!
-I cannot watch him crawl anymore.

31:20.166 --> 31:22.333
Come right for the nuts.
Huh! Drop down low.

31:22.416 --> 31:25.208
[grunting]

31:25.291 --> 31:27.666
We need to keep him alive for the ritual,
then we kill him.

31:28.666 --> 31:31.500
-Where's Sonya?
-[Allison] Where is that sexy psychopath?

31:31.583 --> 31:33.833
I'm here. Getting cookies.

31:34.791 --> 31:38.166
-Get back! Get back!
-Whoa! Yes, Cole!

31:38.250 --> 31:40.541
Standing up for yourself,
just like I showed you!

31:40.625 --> 31:43.458
-Get back, all of you! Stand back!
-Let's draw some blood.

31:43.541 --> 31:45.541
[ethereal music playing]

31:46.166 --> 31:47.166
Ooh.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.791
We're back!

31:56.750 --> 31:57.750
You!

31:58.791 --> 32:03.208
Oh, I knew you were a part of this!
You black cat, hitchhiking Picard killer.

32:03.291 --> 32:05.458
You're the new bad! [panting]

32:07.041 --> 32:10.000
I'm just looking for gas.
My jet ski's running low.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.750
[Boom Boom gasping]

32:11.833 --> 32:14.083
Clearly,
you guys are into some heavy cosplay.

32:14.791 --> 32:15.791
Just leave you be.

32:16.916 --> 32:18.000
Oh no!

32:18.083 --> 32:20.083
It's all gonna get fucked up again.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.666
Nothing is going to get fucked up.

32:22.416 --> 32:23.458
Ow!

32:24.000 --> 32:25.083
Oh shit!

32:25.458 --> 32:28.041
In the face! Right in the face!

32:28.125 --> 32:29.458
Max, go grab them.

32:29.541 --> 32:31.500
Damn, it feels good to be back!

32:31.875 --> 32:35.375
Whoo! I'm coming, Cole!
I'm coming for you!

32:35.458 --> 32:38.083
[suspenseful music playing]

32:39.666 --> 32:41.708
-Go! Let's go! Go, go, go!
-Holy shit!

32:41.791 --> 32:43.208
-Just go!
-[Phoebe] Get away from me!

32:43.291 --> 32:45.250
-What are you doing? OK!
-[Cole] Go on, go!

32:46.458 --> 32:47.375
[Cole] Go, go, go!

32:51.083 --> 32:53.208
[reverential music playing]

32:54.666 --> 32:55.875
That motherfucker!

32:55.958 --> 32:58.416
First Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner
break up, now this?

32:58.500 --> 33:00.500
[dramatic music playing]

33:12.000 --> 33:13.791
[both panting]

33:14.375 --> 33:15.208
What was that?

33:15.291 --> 33:16.708
[Cole panting]

33:17.375 --> 33:18.708
Wait. You saw that?

33:18.791 --> 33:21.166
You saw the dead girl,
the bloodthirsty maniacs?

33:21.250 --> 33:24.666
Did I see that? Of course I saw that shit!
Why'd they kill that girl?

33:25.750 --> 33:28.583
OK, look,
I... I know this is gonna sound crazy,

33:28.666 --> 33:32.541
but, basically, they're a blood cult,
and they made a deal with the Devil,

33:32.625 --> 33:35.625
and in exchange for their souls,
they get any life they want.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.833
Thank God. I thought they were zombies.
I hate zombies.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.208
You... you believe me?

33:42.291 --> 33:46.291
Yes. What else do you expect from
attention-seeking social media millennials

33:46.375 --> 33:47.333
with esteem issues?

33:47.416 --> 33:48.750
-Shit.
-[Max] Nice job, newbies.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.000
Grade A bed-shitting.

33:50.083 --> 33:52.458
-[Melanie] You losers let him go.
-It was a simple task.

33:52.541 --> 33:55.541
How hard is it to contain and drain
a 60-pound freshman?

33:55.625 --> 33:58.125
Just remember,
you guys screwed it up the first time.

33:58.208 --> 34:00.375
That's the only reason
I was called in from the bullpen.

34:00.458 --> 34:03.375
OK, ticktock, teeny-weenies. Let's go!

34:03.458 --> 34:05.083
Ah, you want us to film this?

34:05.166 --> 34:07.708
[Allison] Not the app!
Like a clock. A clock clock.

34:07.791 --> 34:09.541
[Diego] Oh! Like an old clock.

34:09.958 --> 34:12.250
-Update me on the psycho Breakfast Club.
-OK.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.291
Basically,
I saw the older ones die two years ago,

34:14.375 --> 34:17.833
but clearly, they're back to life,
like they're mimetic metal or something.

34:17.916 --> 34:18.958
Liquid alloy?

34:19.333 --> 34:21.708
-Wait, you watched <i>Terminator 2?</i>
-Yes.

34:21.791 --> 34:24.916
It's one of the four sequels in history
that supersedes the original.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.750
Where... We have to stick together.
Where are you going?

34:28.833 --> 34:29.666
"We"?

34:30.083 --> 34:31.291
We are not a thing.

34:31.791 --> 34:34.791
Bear Grylls clearly stipulates
to never split up when in the wild.

34:34.875 --> 34:37.708
Bear Grylls stays at the Ritz-Carlton
with the guys from <i>Queer Eye.</i>

34:37.791 --> 34:40.625
Listen, they're not gonna stop
until they kill us.

34:41.833 --> 34:42.666
Both of us.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.958
Let's just go get them!
I'm already losing hair.

34:46.041 --> 34:50.416
-I think... I think Sonya cursed me.
-Do what, Allison? Look. Hello! Hello!

34:50.875 --> 34:54.083
We're in the middle of Camp Crystal Lake,
and we don't where the fuck they went.

34:54.166 --> 34:55.333
Yes, we do.

34:56.250 --> 35:00.375
-[lighter cap clicks]
-They have no idea what we're capable of.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.458
We need something to fight with.
What do you have in your murder pack?

35:04.541 --> 35:06.833
None of your business, and nothing useful.

35:07.375 --> 35:11.375
OK, let me see what I got.
OK, silly string, lighter...

35:14.458 --> 35:16.041
[Phoebe] "Magnum XLs."

35:16.416 --> 35:19.666
Who were you and your massive schlong
planning to have sex with tonight, Cole?

35:19.750 --> 35:22.666
I thought tonight
was gonna go really differently.

35:28.083 --> 35:31.291
Listen, they only have till sunrise
to complete the ritual, OK?

35:31.375 --> 35:33.583
-So we just have to make it till morning.
-[whooshing]

35:40.208 --> 35:43.375
[grunting, groaning]

35:46.000 --> 35:47.375
[Melanie] They're right there.

35:48.875 --> 35:49.958
I got this.

35:50.625 --> 35:51.458
[sniffs]

35:51.541 --> 35:54.416
This is gonna be so good.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.416
[Sonya] Mmm.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.291
[coughing]

35:59.375 --> 36:02.333
Now do you agree with me?
We have to stick together, Phoebe.

36:03.541 --> 36:04.708
Phoebe?

36:05.125 --> 36:07.125
I wouldn't go out there alone
if I were you.

36:07.458 --> 36:08.458
You're not me!

36:09.958 --> 36:11.208
I came here for a reason.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.833
[breathing heavily]

36:22.416 --> 36:25.375
[tense music playing]

36:25.458 --> 36:27.666

Oh God! [Phoebe pants]

37:03.500 --> 37:05.333
[distant guitar melody playing]

37:13.458 --> 37:15.625
Excuse me? Excuse me?

37:16.375 --> 37:17.458
Sir, hello? Hi.

37:18.541 --> 37:19.875
-[man] Hi.
-Listen--

37:19.958 --> 37:20.791
[man] How you doing?

37:20.875 --> 37:24.791
I'm really sorry. I don't mean to intrude,
but I could really use your help.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.458
Is there any chance you could
give me a ride back into town?

37:27.541 --> 37:28.375
Yeah.

37:29.250 --> 37:30.458
Yeah, I can do that.

37:31.333 --> 37:35.041
Gonna take a minute, 'cause my wife
is out getting some, uh, firewood.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.500
Don't... don't be a stranger.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.708
Of course. Yeah.

37:41.791 --> 37:43.000
Well, come on.

37:48.583 --> 37:49.458
[man sighs]

37:51.791 --> 37:52.666
[man exhales]

37:55.083 --> 37:56.166
[Phoebe] Thank you.

37:57.916 --> 38:00.500
Shaking like a little deer, huh?
Let's get you warm.

38:04.375 --> 38:05.375
Come on, hey.

38:05.458 --> 38:06.875
Come on. Get warm. Get warm.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.333
Get a seat.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.333
-OK.
-Huh?

38:09.416 --> 38:10.583
Get you taken care of.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.375
[blows]

38:14.791 --> 38:16.791
-It's a nice fire, huh?
-Yeah.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.500
-Yeah.
-Really nice.

38:20.458 --> 38:21.458
Do you like fish?

38:23.625 --> 38:24.625
Sure, yeah.

38:25.583 --> 38:26.583
I like snapper.

38:27.625 --> 38:28.500
That's cool.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.583
What're you doing out here alone?

38:31.666 --> 38:32.750
Oh, I'm not alone.

38:33.291 --> 38:34.958
I... I... I wasn't.

38:35.083 --> 38:37.166
He... It's a long story.
He's still out there.

38:37.250 --> 38:38.458
I hope he's OK.

38:38.875 --> 38:39.708
Yeah.

38:40.375 --> 38:42.791
Listen, I... I'm really sorry,
I don't mean to bother,

38:42.875 --> 38:45.208
but do you know
when your wife will be back?

38:46.708 --> 38:47.708
I don't.

38:49.916 --> 38:51.375
She left ten years ago.

38:52.375 --> 38:54.000
[tense music playing]

38:54.875 --> 38:57.875
-No, hey, now you just calm down.
-Listen, I... No, I have to go.

38:57.958 --> 38:59.708
-Shh.
-No, I really should be going.

38:59.791 --> 39:02.625
No! Get your hands off of me!
Don't touch me. Let go!

39:02.708 --> 39:04.291
-I can't be here.
-Be quiet, little fish.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.666
-Get your hands off me!
-Shut up.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.791
Wow, you guys making s'mores?
I absolutely love s'mores!

39:09.208 --> 39:12.541
I think the trick to a perfect s'more
is to get the right heat balance

39:12.625 --> 39:15.833
between the marshmallow, the chocolate,
and the graham cracker. I love s'mores.

39:15.916 --> 39:18.166
[singsong] I eat them just for pleasure!

39:18.250 --> 39:19.500
[echoes]

39:20.625 --> 39:23.166
Hey, this a private party.

39:23.583 --> 39:26.041
We'll just take our private parts
and be on our way.

39:27.375 --> 39:28.708
Get back here! [grunts]

39:29.333 --> 39:30.875
[man] Goddamn it!

[Sonya] Gotta look gorgeous for the One.
Your gorgeous dark One.

39:49.958 --> 39:50.958
Sonya.

39:53.875 --> 39:55.291
[Sonya] You came for me.

39:55.375 --> 39:56.541
[both screaming]

39:56.625 --> 39:58.125
I'll gut you like a fish!

39:58.750 --> 40:00.041
Silence, rapist.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.458

40:19.291 --> 40:21.791
Your blood belongs to us, Cole!

40:21.875 --> 40:22.958
Yeah! Cole!

40:24.583 --> 40:25.708
[crunching]

40:25.791 --> 40:27.916
-Oh shit! Come on.
-What?

40:34.458 --> 40:37.083
-Seriously?
-Turn off your brights, asshole!

40:37.166 --> 40:38.166
[Cole] Oh shit!

40:38.250 --> 40:39.416
[screams]

40:39.500 --> 40:42.458
[Sonya] I'm gonna cut off your face
like Hannibal Lecter, Cole!

40:43.250 --> 40:44.416
[screaming]

40:45.125 --> 40:46.958
Get her off! Get her off!

40:48.041 --> 40:49.916
-I'm gonna get--
-[engine revs]

40:51.125 --> 40:52.083
Fuck!

[blood squelching]

40:59.416 --> 41:01.083
[both panting]

41:04.666 --> 41:05.625
Shall we?

41:07.583 --> 41:08.625
[thud]

41:10.041 --> 41:11.041
[Cole clears throat]

41:17.833 --> 41:18.666
[chuckles]

41:18.750 --> 41:20.375
[distant chatter]

41:20.458 --> 41:22.416
Did you hear that? Come on.

41:25.458 --> 41:27.458
[upbeat music playing]

41:41.708 --> 41:42.666
[Phoebe] Shh.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.583
[breathing heavily]

41:52.875 --> 41:55.875
-Looks like old-ass Sonya failed us.
-"Old"?

41:55.958 --> 41:58.291
-I'm gonna bring it on with this bitch!
-[Max] OK. Easy.

41:58.375 --> 42:01.625
Why don't you little-ass kids
go change your diapers, grab a juice box?

42:01.708 --> 42:04.125
-Leave this to the pros.
-We need to shake these clowns.

42:04.208 --> 42:06.083
-[Melanie] We don't need them.
-[snake rattling]

42:06.166 --> 42:07.541
[gasps]

42:08.416 --> 42:09.791
[John] What'd you say, Teletubby?

42:11.000 --> 42:14.125
Noods, I think you need to speak louder.
Hearing's the first thing to go.

42:14.583 --> 42:15.750
[John] What, Zoolander?

42:16.708 --> 42:21.375
He said that hearing
is the first thing to go, Morgan Freeman.

42:21.458 --> 42:25.208
I heard. Morgan Freeman would beat
your ass into a keto diet, motherfucker.

42:25.291 --> 42:27.583
[Diego] Ah!
Suck on these titties, motherfucker.

42:27.666 --> 42:30.583
-[Phoebe] Be very still.
-[Allison] Why is he even awake...

42:31.916 --> 42:33.916
All right. Enough grab-ass.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.208
You wanna play? Let's split up.

42:38.458 --> 42:41.208
-See which group can find 'em first.
-A little competition.

42:41.291 --> 42:43.083
Yes. Now that I understand.

42:43.166 --> 42:44.666
-[John] Yeah.
-[Max] Worst of luck.

42:45.375 --> 42:47.625
-[Phoebe] They're leaving.
-[snake rattling]

42:51.333 --> 42:53.833

-Wait for your hot red-headed friend!

42:53.916 --> 42:56.333
-[Melanie] Let's go.
-[rattling]

42:56.875 --> 42:57.875

43:32.958 --> 43:34.625
[Diego whimpering]

43:37.500 --> 43:38.916
[Jimmy] I'm here. I'm here.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.541
[Melanie] Are you done sixty-nineing?

43:47.583 --> 43:49.166
-Um... It--
-[Melanie] Now!

43:49.958 --> 43:51.416
It's called ophidiophobia!

43:52.041 --> 43:54.375
-Even Indiana Jones was afraid of snakes!
-[mouths] OK.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.333
[Phoebe] Come on.

43:57.958 --> 43:59.041
Come on.

44:02.750 --> 44:06.458
[Max] Coley! Come out and play!

44:06.541 --> 44:08.375
-[Cole] Where are we going?
-[Phoebe] This way.

44:08.458 --> 44:11.791
[Cole] "This way" where? These shoes
are made for reading, not running.

44:13.041 --> 44:15.166
There's a cabin
at the far end of the lake.

44:15.250 --> 44:18.541
I was heading there before I ran out
of gas. We could hide out till sunrise.

44:18.875 --> 44:20.125
A cabin in the woods.

44:20.208 --> 44:22.208
Nobody's ever been murdered
in a cabin in the woods.

44:22.291 --> 44:24.166
[Max grunting eerily]

44:25.166 --> 44:27.625
[John] Max! Stop that shit. It's creepy.

44:27.708 --> 44:30.791
It's supposed to be.
We're hunting children. [grunts eerily]

44:30.875 --> 44:35.333
You know what? I am done, OK?
Done with this chase bullshit.

44:35.416 --> 44:38.000
How about you two go be frivolous
and fetch me that boy?

44:38.083 --> 44:39.791
I think she meant "chivalrous."

44:39.875 --> 44:41.958
This rock looks like a spa day!

44:42.041 --> 44:44.166
-I am dead tired.
-And I'm tired of being dead.

44:44.250 --> 44:47.416
Can we hurry up and do this shit?
And why you trying to look sexy?

44:47.500 --> 44:50.083
The only thing that's sexy in the desert:
a glass of water.

44:50.166 --> 44:52.250
Who goes hiking wearing fuck-me pumps?

44:52.333 --> 44:54.833
They're not "fuck-me pumps,"
they're fuck <i>you </i>pumps.

44:55.208 --> 44:56.791
We're gonna go. You hold up the rear.

44:56.875 --> 44:59.958
Now that is a job I can do.
You both have really cute butts.

45:00.041 --> 45:03.375
-You been looking at my ass?
-Wow. You are so lucky you're hot.

45:03.875 --> 45:08.291
Duh! What I've been telling everybody!
Y'all are really lucky I'm hot.

45:08.791 --> 45:10.666
[Cole] Hold on a second.
I gotta tie my shoes.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.416
Hey, um...

45:14.250 --> 45:15.875
[panting]

45:17.208 --> 45:19.375
I'm really sorry
for bailing on you out there.

45:19.958 --> 45:20.958
Huh?

45:21.500 --> 45:23.458
But I really appreciate you coming back.

45:25.250 --> 45:27.833
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

45:28.250 --> 45:31.000
What? No, you don't need to say sorry.
I'm sorry. I...

45:31.375 --> 45:33.750
I'm the one who dragged you
into the worst night of your life.

45:33.833 --> 45:36.041
Believe it or not,
this is not the worst night of my life.

45:36.125 --> 45:39.125
What, you can beat rattlesnakes,
flamethrowers, and dead bodies?

45:39.208 --> 45:40.875
I mean, did you see Sonya's head?

45:42.750 --> 45:44.791
It's not my first time seeing someone die.

45:57.458 --> 45:59.458
Do you think everything happens
for a reason?

46:00.750 --> 46:01.750
No, Cole.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.916
There's no chakras, no Santa,

46:07.583 --> 46:09.291
no soulmates, no afterlife.

46:11.708 --> 46:13.083
Them's the breaks, Ponyboy.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.375
"Stay gold," my ass.

46:16.958 --> 46:18.583
Wow. That's...

46:19.875 --> 46:22.375
That's a really bleak outlook on the world

46:22.458 --> 46:24.833
for somebody
who's about to bring new life into it.

46:26.708 --> 46:27.666
Huh?

46:27.750 --> 46:29.708
I mean, you're pregnant.

46:31.583 --> 46:33.916
-Oh! That was all bullshit.
-What?

46:34.000 --> 46:37.083
Yeah, I just said all that so everybody
would leave me alone. Yeah.

46:37.708 --> 46:38.791
-Come on.
-You just...

46:39.208 --> 46:40.375
[Phoebe] We gotta keep moving.

46:43.083 --> 46:44.625
[tense music playing]

46:44.708 --> 46:45.833
[rocks crumbling]

46:51.500 --> 46:52.708
-Look right.
-Yeah.

46:52.791 --> 46:53.625
Now look up.

46:53.708 --> 46:56.958
And now the three moons,
and then there's that chicken right here.

46:57.041 --> 46:59.291
-So real.
-I wanna just grab it. Boom, boom.

47:00.041 --> 47:02.833
I think it's great
that he's taking a joyride with Melanie.

47:02.916 --> 47:04.791
-Teens being teens.
-Teens being teens!

47:04.875 --> 47:07.958
-That's great parenting. Take the win.
-No, I said no, so I'm not going to.

47:08.041 --> 47:11.041
Why don't I just do everything?
I'll light it, pull the carb out.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.208
-If I don't touch, I'm not smoking it.
-It's not real.

47:13.291 --> 47:14.458
It's second-hand smoke.

-[coughs]

47:29.500 --> 47:31.416
[Cole] How do we know
this cabin's gonna be empty?

47:31.500 --> 47:33.166
I just know, all right?

47:33.250 --> 47:36.208
It was my family's cabin,
but no one's been for a long time.

47:36.291 --> 47:39.000
I don't wanna talk about it.
Just whatever. It's empty.

47:39.416 --> 47:42.791
Wait, you... you came to a big,
crowded, popular people event

47:42.875 --> 47:45.000
to stay in a remote cabin all by yourself?

47:45.333 --> 47:47.625
I needed to be alone.
You wouldn't understand.

47:47.708 --> 47:51.333
What... Yeah.
Trust me, I... I understand being alone.

47:52.416 --> 47:55.666
I don't know if you noticed,
but everybody at school thinks I'm weird.

47:55.750 --> 47:59.041
I didn't notice. The three-piece suit
seemed perfectly reasonable to me.

47:59.125 --> 48:00.583
Yeah. Ha-ha, OK, but...

48:01.000 --> 48:03.125
What I'm saying is,
I don't think anyone chooses to--

-Um... We won't be in touch.
-[Allison] Well...

48:29.583 --> 48:32.791

Right?

-Like the look?

49:36.750 --> 49:38.500
Your verbal acuity is unparalleled.

49:38.583 --> 49:41.750
Exactly! Allison, you...
you are ready for prime time.

49:41.833 --> 49:44.125
-"Prime time?"
-You are a star.

49:44.208 --> 49:45.500
Y... You think I'm a star?

49:45.583 --> 49:46.583
A shining...

you'd do that for me?

We can walk away from all this
and forget it ever happened.

Maybe you should stick with trust

That's the same way he used to look at me.

Cole, I found a babysitter.
Where have you been?

1:29:38.666 --> 1:29:40.833
You raised a fine young man, Mr. Johnson.

1:29:41.958 --> 1:29:42.958
I'm coming down.

1:29:46.416 --> 1:29:48.250

Please, there has to be another way, Bee.

1:30:29.291 --> 1:30:30.125
No.
