<i>Here we are, folks,
on the red carpet at the grand opening...</i>

02:11.841 --> 02:13.968
<i>...of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:17.137
<i>Tonight's premiere exhibit
is a rousing look back...</i>

02:17.304 --> 02:20.015
<i>...at the exploits of Mystery Incorporated.</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:22.852
<i>And here they are.</i>

02:27.773 --> 02:32.361
Folks, this crowd is going crazy
over Mystery Inc.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.947
Here you go, girls.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.701
I got an ascot for each of you.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.829
Hello!

02:42.288 --> 02:47.209
Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake
and the whole city's shaking!

02:47.376 --> 02:48.419
Yeah!

02:50.254 --> 02:51.797
Come on, Scoob.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.304
Sorry.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.181
I consider it a privilege, sir.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.019
- Daphne!
- Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.522
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!

03:09.023 --> 03:14.486
Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed
on our chests! Look!

03:15.821 --> 03:18.032
That's very sweet.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.534
Velma! Velma!

03:26.957 --> 03:30.127
- Sign it, please.
- We love you, Velma.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.462
Thanks.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.840
- I love her so much.
- May I have a word...

03:35.007 --> 03:37.843
- ...with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
- Absolutely.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.596
That's your word.
Come on, dear. We're late.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.057
Heather Jasper-Howe
at the grand opening...

03:43.223 --> 03:45.642
...of the new Coolsonian
Criminology Museum...

03:45.809 --> 03:49.813
...with our guests of honor, the master
detectives of Mystery Incorporated.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.317
Shaggy!

03:56.403 --> 03:57.571
Right on!

03:57.738 --> 03:59.865
Hello! Hello!

04:10.376 --> 04:14.713
With all your success, will you still
have time for us in little old Coolsville?

04:14.880 --> 04:18.466
Of course little old Coolsville
can solve its problems without us...

04:18.634 --> 04:20.886
...but we'll always be here to help.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.014
The people of Coolsville
are the best in the world!

04:31.730 --> 04:35.567
- Can you tell us a little about the exhibit?
- Absolutely.

04:35.734 --> 04:40.656
Mystery Inc. is proud to donate the
costumes of criminals we've unmasked.

04:40.989 --> 04:45.077
- Like The Black Knight Ghost.
- Our very first case.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.579
The 10,000 Volt Ghost.

04:48.831 --> 04:53.460
The Skeleton Men,
and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.

04:55.462 --> 04:59.633
We've also donated the costumes
of some of our more ridiculous foes.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.176
Like Chickenstein.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.887
Can we get a shot of you
next to The Black Night?

05:04.054 --> 05:07.808
Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot
that dude tried to pluck us.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.562
- Remember what I told you?
- Never pick your nose in public?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.689
No, but that's good too.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.900
- Image is everything.
- Yes! Image is everything.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.571
The whole city's watching,
so try and keep a brave face.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.741
- They're costumes.
- Right.

05:26.743 --> 05:31.665
She's right, Scoob.
Up close, they look totally fake.

05:34.710 --> 05:39.631
The Tar Monster scared the locals
of Byzantius away to take their treasure.

05:39.923 --> 05:44.344
But on the positive side,
he'd pave your driveway for free.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.638
Isn't that right, Velma?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.182
Velma?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.545
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.342
Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.

06:23.508 --> 06:27.346
He's the curator here at the museum.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.431
It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.

06:29.598 --> 06:33.935
I hope you'll be working closely with
Velma on this ever-expanding exhibit.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.940
I know that you're a glamorous,
mysterious, jet-set adventurer...

06:39.107 --> 06:41.943
...preoccupied with
international intrigue and all....

06:42.110 --> 06:46.198
- Yes. That's me.
- I know, but....

06:47.074 --> 06:51.828
There's a symposium coming up on
syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain--

06:52.287 --> 06:55.248
I have always found
a criminal's inclination...

06:55.415 --> 07:00.045
...to incorrectly use the interrogative
pronoun in place of the relative...

07:00.212 --> 07:01.797
...delightfully absurd.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.675
- Me too!
- Really?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.178
So maybe you'd want to go together?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.306
Suppose you mean like....

07:12.224 --> 07:13.725
Like a....

07:14.267 --> 07:16.770
Like a date. With me.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.815
No, I can't, Patrick.

07:21.817 --> 07:25.320
Mystery is my mistress.
I must heed her sweet call.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.072
Okay.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.931
What's happening?

08:06.361 --> 08:07.654
Oh, boy.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.242
Daphne!

08:12.409 --> 08:14.828
Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!

08:22.294 --> 08:26.339
- We need to come up with a plan.
- Hiding is our plan.

08:26.548 --> 08:30.468
In case you haven't noticed, there's
an unidentified freaky object in here!

08:32.178 --> 08:34.472
- The curtains!
- We're on them!

08:34.972 --> 08:40.395
- Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!
- But chickens aren't good with ropes!

08:41.980 --> 08:46.192
- We got him!
- Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!

08:46.401 --> 08:49.613
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!

08:50.238 --> 08:51.406
It's just a costume!

08:52.282 --> 08:53.909
We tied it! Let go!

09:12.886 --> 09:13.929
Sorry!

09:14.095 --> 09:16.806
- We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
- As usual!

09:27.025 --> 09:28.735
Fire!

09:34.616 --> 09:38.203
Mystery Incorporated.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.585
This is only the first rung
on the ladder of your demise.

09:45.752 --> 09:46.878
Look out!

09:54.636 --> 09:58.932
And this time,
you'll be the ones unmasked...

09:59.307 --> 10:02.560
...as the buffoons you truly are!

10:13.863 --> 10:18.118
Any clues to the cause of the attack? How
did the dinosaur get through security?

10:18.284 --> 10:20.412
Where did Mystery Inc.'s plan go wrong?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.549
A secret hatch!

10:33.091 --> 10:36.719
The real Pterodactyl Ghost
must have come through here!

10:43.435 --> 10:45.687
A reptilian scale.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.690
A most wonderful clue.

10:48.857 --> 10:53.695
He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
Ghost and The 10,000 Volt Ghost. Why?

10:53.862 --> 10:57.240
Fred, Daphne. Could you answer
a few questions for the press?

10:58.366 --> 11:01.494
Fred, I don't think
that's a really good idea.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.290
We always face the press
after we've unmasked the creeps.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.375
We looked ridiculous back there.

11:07.542 --> 11:11.296
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
The press loves us.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.890
<i>The higher the pedestal,
the harder the fall.</i>

11:22.056 --> 11:26.019
<i>And Mystery Inc. fell far
in the embarrassing debacle...</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:29.022
<i>...that tarnished the reputation
of the once-great gang.</i>

11:29.189 --> 11:33.067
<i>It was an utter disaster
as two of the gang's key members...</i>

11:33.234 --> 11:36.196
<i>...Norville "Shaggy" Rogers
and Scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...</i>

11:36.362 --> 11:40.241
<i>...caused untold damage to Coolsville's
hottest new tourist attraction...</i>

11:40.408 --> 11:43.119
<i>... which took a full two years to complete.</i>

11:43.286 --> 11:47.749
<i>When asked for comment, Fred Jones,
leader of Mystery Inc., said this:</i>

11:47.916 --> 11:50.585
<i>Coolsville can solve its
problems without us.</i>

11:50.752 --> 11:53.212
I didn't say that! I mean....

11:53.379 --> 11:55.882
I did, but that's out of context!

11:56.049 --> 11:59.761
<i>This is Heather Jasper-Howe,
disillusioned from Coolsville.</i>

12:03.431 --> 12:05.433
It's all my fault.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.437
I'm the one who told Shaggy
and Scooby to get the ropes.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.940
No, Velma, it's my fault.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.317
I should have checked
that they were tied before I let go.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.235
It's my fault too.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.738
We all know how Shaggy
and Scooby can be.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.239
But it's all right.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.160
We just need to stay strong,
in control, and work fast.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.621
Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.083
We'll figure a way out
of this Jurassic jumble.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.088
Shaggy?

12:36.130 --> 12:38.633
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.970
I guess, looking back, every time they
made a plan, we did screw it up somehow.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.348
- I just never noticed before.
- Me neither.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.811
There's gotta be some way we can prove
that we actually belong in the gang.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.481
We've gotta do something
totally unlike us.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.483
You know, Scoob...

12:55.983 --> 12:58.611
...we could act like real detectives!

13:01.614 --> 13:02.657
Really?

13:04.784 --> 13:09.664
Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
No, your right paw. Your other paw.

13:09.831 --> 13:14.669
Repeat after me. From this day forward
we will no longer be our goofy selves.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.506
We will be awesome detectives.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.052
And we will act more like Fred
and Velma and Daphne.

13:23.219 --> 13:27.515
We will be terrific and fantastic
and spectacular...

13:27.682 --> 13:32.019
...and cease to be "loser-iffic,"
"lame-tastic" and "suck-tacular."

13:32.895 --> 13:34.856
Suck-tacular.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.861
Right, like, it's time to solve the mystery.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.573
Let's kick this investigation up to an 11!

13:44.365 --> 13:46.200
What the heck are you guys doing?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.911
We figured the first step
in solving a mystery...

13:49.078 --> 13:51.706
...would be to wear the right attire.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.126
I'm sorry, Daph,
but your go-go boots didn't fit...

13:55.877 --> 13:57.420
...me!

14:00.047 --> 14:03.676
Scooby! Those so don't go
with that sweater!

14:03.843 --> 14:05.011
Really?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.059
Clues!

14:12.226 --> 14:15.271
Alas, what are these strange markings?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.025
Words.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.278
Words!

14:22.737 --> 14:24.197
Scooby-Doo, take notes.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.908
- Gotcha.
- Come on, you kooks.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.784
Okay.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.580
It's come back positive.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.041
This is a real pterodactyl scale.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.250
Precisely!

14:36.417 --> 14:38.711
That masked figure
was out to humiliate us.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.131
Maybe it's someone we unmasked.

14:42.298 --> 14:46.385
But who would be able to make
a real Pterodactyl Ghost?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.890
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.600
Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.101
That's right!

14:56.312 --> 15:00.441
<i>Jacobo wreaked havoc
in a statewide crime spree.</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:05.446
<i>Jacobo stole millions...</i>

15:05.613 --> 15:10.117
<i>... which he used to finance his failed
experiments trying to create monsters.</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:13.162
Come alive! Come alive!

15:23.965 --> 15:26.133
<i>You think Jacobo's behind this?</i>

15:26.425 --> 15:30.137
<i>Impossible. Three years ago
he attempted a prison escape.</i>

15:40.648 --> 15:42.984
So long, suckers!

15:46.445 --> 15:48.489
Help me, suckers!

15:50.032 --> 15:52.493
His body was lost at sea.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.123
How about this? Jacobo's cellmate
was released from prison two months ago.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.833
Jeremiah Wickles.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.004
The Black Knight Ghost. That was
one of the costumes that was stolen.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.964
Right! And....

16:07.967 --> 16:10.386
Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.471
Bunny.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.690
<i>It seems Old Man Wickles
deserves a visit...</i>

16:23.315 --> 16:26.527
<i>...before any of our other creepy
conquests make a comeback.</i>

16:26.694 --> 16:28.195
Freddy, up on the right.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.031
Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.079
Oh, man. Another creepy crib!

16:37.538 --> 16:41.125
How come we can't ever investigate,
like, a KFC or something?

16:41.292 --> 16:42.334
Shaggy!

16:43.878 --> 16:48.257
All right. Then again,
creepy is my middle name.

16:52.595 --> 16:53.721
Scoob!

16:57.349 --> 16:58.809
Come on, Scoob!

16:58.976 --> 17:01.479
Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.400
Nice job last night. Losers!

17:07.108 --> 17:09.569
Quick, we need to think of a comeback.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.030
What dorks.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.365
Hey! Shut up!

17:15.284 --> 17:16.911
That's a good one.

17:17.953 --> 17:20.873
<i>You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.</i>

17:21.040 --> 17:25.044
<i>- Leave now or pay the price.
- What jerk makes that his doorbell?</i>

17:25.502 --> 17:26.545
Dude.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.797
He just said we'd pay the price.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.716
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.470
What could possibly happen
by ringing a doorbell?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.819
Help me!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.447
Shaggy!

18:00.788 --> 18:02.623
I think I pulled something.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.585
That's what can happen
by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!

18:06.752 --> 18:10.839
<i>At 7 p.m., the owner
will be home to set you free.</i>

18:12.633 --> 18:14.635
You want to buy a box of cookies?

18:15.135 --> 18:18.847
Excuse me.
Have you heard the Good News?

18:19.014 --> 18:21.308
Yeah. There's cookies!

18:21.517 --> 18:22.977
Watch the junk!

18:23.143 --> 18:24.270
Sorry.

18:24.436 --> 18:28.983
Oh, brother.
The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.652
- Let me just get to my makeup.
- Daph, now?

18:31.819 --> 18:35.990
You know what, Velma? It's never too late
to learn to properly apply makeup.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.493
Okay. The last good thumbprint
should still be there, so...

18:39.660 --> 18:41.495
...a little blush...

18:41.996 --> 18:43.163
...a pore strip...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.335
...and voilà.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.962
All right, Daph!

18:50.170 --> 18:52.172
I enjoy being a girl.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.513
- Thank you!
- See if I can get my mechanic's job back.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.932
- Twenty, 30, 40...
- Thanks for the cookies.

19:02.099 --> 19:06.353
...50-- Welcome!
Sixty, 70, 80....

19:07.521 --> 19:11.734
Okay, gang. Let's, like,
split up and search for clues.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.737
Scoob and I will go this way.
Come on, Scoob.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.740
He stole my thing that I say!

19:30.210 --> 19:33.547
Search for clues. Search for clues.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.845
A clue!

19:46.935 --> 19:49.021
Shiny footprints.

19:49.563 --> 19:53.400
The glow is similar
to the pterodactyl scale.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.454
A clue!

20:06.413 --> 20:11.293
It looks like Wickles shares Jacobo's
fascination with the supernatural.

20:11.752 --> 20:15.631
He collects everything
from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.966
He collects dust too.

20:18.133 --> 20:21.803
No. The dust is good.
We can tell what he's been reading lately.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.765
Like here!

20:25.140 --> 20:26.475
What is it?

20:26.975 --> 20:31.980
It's an obsolete Celtic text used by
secret societies in the mid-19th century.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.443
Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.946
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.949
Maybe he gave it to Wickles
before he died.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.844
Can you read it?

21:04.972 --> 21:08.517
It's an amalgamation
of magic and science.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.310
Here's a list of ingredients...

21:10.477 --> 21:12.771
...on how to create
your own carbon-based...

21:12.938 --> 21:15.023
...organic, composite predators.

21:15.190 --> 21:19.444
This is an instruction manual
on how to create monsters.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.492
Scoob.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.327
Clues!

21:29.288 --> 21:32.833
Those aren't clues, Scoob.
Those are just things you want.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.669
Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?

21:39.381 --> 21:44.344
Just because you can sing in it doesn't
make it a clue. It makes it awesome.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.272
Like, what's this?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.525
"The Faux Ghost."

22:00.193 --> 22:02.237
We're in luck.
It's tonight, Scoob!

22:03.071 --> 22:05.032
- We are detectives.
- Really?

22:05.198 --> 22:07.701
You found an actual clue!

22:09.870 --> 22:11.496
I found a clue!

22:12.998 --> 22:15.208
Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!

22:15.375 --> 22:17.669
We're going back, we're going back!

22:28.930 --> 22:30.891
Black Knight Ghost!

22:37.564 --> 22:39.107
Run, Shaggy!

22:40.275 --> 22:41.401
Let's go.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.112
Like, lock the door!

22:48.950 --> 22:50.410
Heavy stuff, Scoob!

22:53.079 --> 22:54.748
Give me a hand, Scoob!

22:54.915 --> 22:57.250
See him get through this!

22:57.709 --> 22:58.877
Heavy!

23:00.128 --> 23:02.380
We outsmarted that moron!

23:02.547 --> 23:04.883
Yeah! What a moron.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.302
Look at me.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.430
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.107
- Yo, metalhead!
- Yes?

23:21.733 --> 23:22.943
Bring it.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.115
He brought it.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.957
Daphne! Hold him off!

23:37.123 --> 23:38.625
I'll look in the book.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.753
Maybe there's a formula
for finding his weakness.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.178
Here. "To find a creature's
weakest point...

23:51.638 --> 23:55.141
...take the angle between
the current position of the sun...

23:56.101 --> 23:58.603
- ...and your geographical point--"
- Velma!

23:59.271 --> 24:02.524
"Add this point, 28 and a half feet up
from sea level."

24:04.693 --> 24:06.152
That tickles.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.821
This is bad.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.990
"Multiply this number--"

24:11.324 --> 24:13.034
"Add the square inches of--"

24:16.454 --> 24:17.664
Velma!

24:23.670 --> 24:25.255
"--the square root..."

24:32.220 --> 24:34.556
Now it's good night, ladies!

24:35.849 --> 24:37.017
"--your X-axis."

24:58.204 --> 25:01.875
"And subtract 9034. That's your Y-axis."

25:02.042 --> 25:04.002
Look. No hands!

25:04.169 --> 25:06.004
Any time would be great, Velma!

25:06.171 --> 25:07.255
I'm trying.

25:07.422 --> 25:11.676
"Subtract one, divide by B,
follow upward eight degrees north."

25:11.843 --> 25:14.054
Which makes his weakest point right here!

25:18.183 --> 25:20.602
Right in the roundtables.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.895
Run!

25:22.062 --> 25:24.397
In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

25:24.564 --> 25:26.733
Come on, Scoob! Inside!

25:30.361 --> 25:33.907
I'll compare the glow of those footprints
to the pterodactyl scale.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.076
We'll check out Wickles' book.

25:36.242 --> 25:40.205
Dude, The Faux Ghost is an awesome
clue. But what do we do with it?

25:40.371 --> 25:42.207
Let's solve the mystery.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.667
If we solve the mystery by ourselves...

25:44.834 --> 25:47.712
...it would certainly prove to the gang
that we belong.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.798
Let's head to The Faux Ghost...

25:49.964 --> 25:52.133
...find Wickles, and see what he knows.

25:52.300 --> 25:56.262
But first, let's give the gang
the old "slipperooney."

26:05.355 --> 26:07.107
Hey, guys.

26:07.273 --> 26:09.609
Scooby's feeling kind of...

26:10.276 --> 26:12.570
...like he's got rabies.

26:16.783 --> 26:20.453
We're just gonna go outside
to get some fresh air.

26:32.632 --> 26:33.967
Jinkies!

26:40.098 --> 26:41.808
What's up, Velms?

26:41.975 --> 26:44.352
The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.

26:44.519 --> 26:47.438
It contains randamonium,
which this books says...

26:47.605 --> 26:50.400
...is the critical ingredient
needed to make monsters.

26:50.567 --> 26:54.153
Doesn't randamonium glow,
like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?

26:54.320 --> 26:58.324
If we prove Wickles is behind this,
this mystery goes down like a dot-com...

26:58.491 --> 27:01.286
- ...and Coolsville digs us again.
- Where would he get randamonium?

27:01.452 --> 27:04.664
Randamonium is the byproduct
of silver mines.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.834
Like the abandoned mining town
in old Coolsville.

27:08.001 --> 27:11.296
Then we better get to that mining town
and see what's--

27:13.172 --> 27:15.425
I'm invisible. I'm invisible.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.137
Get rid of him!

27:20.013 --> 27:21.764
Keep him busy.

27:26.185 --> 27:27.812
What are you doing?

27:28.187 --> 27:30.189
He wants to ask me on a date.

27:30.356 --> 27:32.025
It's okay to be scared.

27:32.191 --> 27:35.862
I am not scared.
I've fought werewolves and ghosts.

27:36.029 --> 27:40.491
But in the end, we usually unmask them
and it's a little scared man inside.

27:40.658 --> 27:42.619
It's the same with dating.

27:43.661 --> 27:47.665
Velma, have you ever considered
that maybe werewolves and ghosts...

27:47.832 --> 27:51.711
...are just distractions to keep you away
from what really frightens you?

27:51.878 --> 27:53.671
Intimacy with another person.

27:53.838 --> 27:57.133
And by intimacy, I mean someone
who thinks you're really hot.

27:58.801 --> 28:03.014
But I'm more comfortable
in the world of logic and facts.

28:04.223 --> 28:06.142
And...

28:07.185 --> 28:10.980
...I'm not hot.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.193
Me neither.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.155
Everybody has flaws, Velma.
The object of a healthy relationship...

28:19.322 --> 28:22.325
...is to never let the other person
know they're there.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.911
- To museums.
- To museums.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.289
Daph, I really like this guy.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.583
What would you do if someone thought...

28:30.750 --> 28:36.172
...that you were some glamorous
and mysterious jet-setter?

28:39.258 --> 28:40.843
I'd make myself one.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.358
Who's your mommy?

28:58.361 --> 28:59.445
My mommy?

28:59.612 --> 29:02.115
Come on, let's solve a mystery.

29:19.799 --> 29:23.970
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No, I can't in this outfit.

29:43.698 --> 29:46.409
Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.618
Here we go.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.505
That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.716
Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.

30:01.883 --> 30:05.386
Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.

30:05.553 --> 30:09.223
And that's Aggie Wilkins,
a.k.a. the Ozark Witch.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.851
These are all folks we unmasked.

30:12.018 --> 30:15.021
If they spot us,
they'll invite us to a weenie roast.

30:15.187 --> 30:17.481
One where we're the weenies!

30:18.316 --> 30:19.817
Hot dogs!

30:19.984 --> 30:24.071
There's gotta be some way that we can
use our awesome, fearless new skills...

30:24.238 --> 30:27.491
...to get us in there
without being recognized.

30:57.563 --> 30:59.940
Everyone part like the Red Sea.

31:00.107 --> 31:04.779
It's me, Shizzy McCreepy,
and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.

31:04.945 --> 31:08.407
We are in the house and ready to party.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.534
Hey, handsome.

31:10.701 --> 31:12.578
Hello, baby.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.665
<i>- Zoinks!
- Jinkies!</i>

31:16.832 --> 31:18.417
<i>- Hey, gang.
- Jinkies!</i>

31:18.584 --> 31:19.835
<i>- Hey!
- Yipe!</i>

31:23.672 --> 31:28.219
A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier
than a Cotton Candy Glob!

31:31.597 --> 31:33.641
Watch out, idiot.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.646
- Old Man Wickles!
- Leave me alone.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.440
No!

31:42.691 --> 31:46.445
I just wanted to say thank you.

31:46.862 --> 31:52.159
Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost
was inspirational to my brother and me.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.957
Have you done anything cool
and creepy lately?

31:58.791 --> 32:02.420
Listen, I'm not normally one
for giving advice...

32:02.586 --> 32:07.091
...but I feel sorry for you because
of your brother's hideous nose deformity.

32:10.052 --> 32:12.805
Get out of this game
while you got a chance.

32:13.931 --> 32:16.267
All of us here ain't nothing to admire.

32:16.433 --> 32:19.478
We needed people to believe
we were different than we were.

32:19.645 --> 32:21.480
Maybe because we believed...

32:21.647 --> 32:25.317
...that there was something wrong
with who we were in the first place.

32:26.277 --> 32:31.031
I guess you're sort of grateful
to Mystery Inc...

32:31.991 --> 32:35.119
- ...for unmasking you.
- Are you kidding?

32:36.996 --> 32:40.791
If I see those twerps,
I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.

32:41.625 --> 32:46.088
Make them eat the one eye while watching
themselves eat it with the other eye!

32:49.341 --> 32:50.384
Bye.

32:51.927 --> 32:56.849
Here's a clue for you.
That dude's wearing his freak hat 24/7.

32:57.016 --> 33:00.853
I gotta take a whiz.
Don't do anything to attract attention.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.271
Gotcha.

33:02.605 --> 33:03.939
Hey, doll.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.483
You wanna dance?

33:06.650 --> 33:07.860
Groovy.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.364
Here we go.

33:16.410 --> 33:18.287
Shake it, baby.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.922
Give me five!

33:51.945 --> 33:53.364
Oh, yeah!

33:54.698 --> 33:56.200
Everybody!

34:12.341 --> 34:13.884
Oh, yeah.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.844
Hey, Shaggy!

34:36.407 --> 34:39.909
It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt
what helped throw us in jail!

34:41.036 --> 34:42.204
Who, me?

34:45.040 --> 34:47.708
No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!

34:47.876 --> 34:51.463
That's S.D. McCrawley.
He's just wearing a mask.

34:57.302 --> 35:02.182
And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
Shaggy Rogers.

35:02.349 --> 35:04.476
- Where?
- There.

35:05.102 --> 35:07.396
Zoinks! Gangway!

35:10.190 --> 35:12.651
Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!

35:18.657 --> 35:20.409
And stay out!

35:24.746 --> 35:27.749
That wasn't so bad, Scoob.

35:44.641 --> 35:47.102
That was my outfit, I swear.

35:54.109 --> 35:58.822
You know, Velma,
you are as beautiful as ever.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.784
You're just so different than I expected.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.163
You know, I'm just....

36:11.585 --> 36:15.505
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the heck's going on?

36:15.672 --> 36:17.716
This cannot be good.

36:19.843 --> 36:21.386
My museum.

36:23.805 --> 36:25.682
Wait!

36:27.309 --> 36:29.061
Any comments on the museum robbery?

36:29.227 --> 36:32.189
Mystery Inc. is investigating
the two stolen costumes.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.274
No, the one that just happened.

36:34.441 --> 36:38.737
Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?

36:38.904 --> 36:41.365
The rest of the costumes?

36:52.042 --> 36:55.504
So, what you're saying is
it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.

36:55.671 --> 37:00.217
No! You're doing that thing again where
you take everything I say out of context.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.553
You're trying to make it look
like I think Coolsville sucks.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.013
No! Don't record that!

37:13.689 --> 37:18.402
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
It must be so hard for you.

37:18.568 --> 37:20.445
I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?

37:20.654 --> 37:22.864
- I'll go with you--
- No! Just--

37:23.949 --> 37:27.077
No, I have to figure out what's going on.

37:51.518 --> 37:53.437
<i>All Fred Jones had to say was:</i>

37:53.603 --> 37:55.063
<i>I think Coolsville sucks!</i>

37:55.230 --> 37:57.774
<i>In light of the city's recent chaos...</i>

37:57.941 --> 38:01.820
<i>... Jones' response was disheartening
to the fans who have supported them.</i>

38:01.987 --> 38:05.574
<i>Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving
gang to shape up or ship out.</i>

38:05.740 --> 38:06.783
I'll be right back.

38:06.950 --> 38:11.204
This is Heather Jasper-Howe
for Investigative Probe Reporting.

38:11.371 --> 38:13.665
What's with the personal attacks?

38:13.832 --> 38:16.793
Look, I'm a huge fan. It's just my editor--

38:16.960 --> 38:18.211
Who are you kidding?

38:20.589 --> 38:22.174
Who are you kidding?

38:22.340 --> 38:24.509
Don't think I don't know your game.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.970
What do you do for the gang?

38:27.512 --> 38:28.805
Really?

38:28.972 --> 38:32.934
Velma's the smart one. Fred's the leader.

38:33.101 --> 38:35.937
All you are is a pretty little face.

38:36.104 --> 38:37.522
Why are you doing this?

38:37.689 --> 38:42.152
Because it's my job to unmask
those who pretend to be who they're not.

38:43.987 --> 38:46.740
"Unmask those"? You sound like....

38:48.617 --> 38:50.243
Sound like who?

38:51.119 --> 38:53.121
The evil masked guy.

38:53.288 --> 38:57.042
But you know that, because
just as you know I'm standing here...

38:57.292 --> 38:59.336
...you know I know
who you know you are...

38:59.502 --> 39:01.588
...which is him, who's a her,
which is you.

39:02.422 --> 39:04.549
Now I see what you do for the gang.

39:04.716 --> 39:06.927
You're in charge of incoherent babbling.

39:07.093 --> 39:10.680
Mystery Incorporated.

39:11.556 --> 39:16.811
Once again, you are proven useless
before my power.

39:16.978 --> 39:21.024
Because of you, soon Coolsville...

39:21.566 --> 39:24.069
...will be mine.

39:26.780 --> 39:27.864
Darn it.

39:28.156 --> 39:31.409
Thanks a lot!
The scoop of the night, gone.

39:31.576 --> 39:33.245
Can't you do anything right?

39:33.453 --> 39:35.664
Ned, get your camera and follow me.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.332
Guess not.

39:45.382 --> 39:47.050
Stop wasting my time!

39:47.342 --> 39:50.971
You hear me? Now I want you to question
all your scum-bucket friends.

39:51.137 --> 39:53.890
Find out what they know
about those stolen costumes.

39:54.057 --> 39:57.018
Or else you'll be known
as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!

39:57.185 --> 39:59.729
I want answers. Now, go! Now!

40:00.021 --> 40:01.147
Yes, sir!

40:02.065 --> 40:04.693
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

40:08.822 --> 40:10.115
Patrick.

40:10.281 --> 40:12.784
Shaggy. Scooby.

40:13.618 --> 40:15.620
What are you guys doing here?

40:16.830 --> 40:20.166
We just came down here
to be undercover and stuff.

40:20.959 --> 40:22.002
Me too.

40:22.168 --> 40:23.878
My museum got broken into again...

40:24.045 --> 40:26.631
...so I had to come here
and try and get some answers.

40:26.798 --> 40:30.301
Gotta put on the tough-guy act,
or these guys will eat me alive.

40:31.970 --> 40:34.097
What's the matter, you don't believe me?

40:36.641 --> 40:38.309
I'm kidding!

40:39.144 --> 40:41.980
- It's the tough-guy act.
- That's good.

40:47.235 --> 40:48.361
I got you.

40:48.528 --> 40:50.822
That was a joke? That was good!

40:50.989 --> 40:53.241
You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.

40:56.035 --> 40:57.746
It needs work.

40:59.497 --> 41:00.915
Look, Patrick...

41:01.082 --> 41:06.004
...we could stay here, do this all night,
and something tells me you would...

41:06.171 --> 41:10.175
...but we gotta make
like your personality and split.

41:10.884 --> 41:12.051
Okay.

41:45.877 --> 41:47.378
Scooby-Doo. Scoob!

41:47.921 --> 41:49.464
Hello?

41:49.631 --> 41:51.549
Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?

41:51.716 --> 41:53.384
Hello, Shaggy.

41:53.551 --> 41:56.846
Wickles has led us
into a terrifying ghost town!

41:57.555 --> 42:00.892
- Ghost town?
- Yes, a ghost town!

42:06.481 --> 42:09.275
Darn bushes yowling at me again.

42:15.448 --> 42:18.826
- Keep quiet, Scoob.
- Okay, Shaggy.

42:23.998 --> 42:28.294
Like, where did Old Man Nutjob go?
Through here, Scoob?

42:28.461 --> 42:29.754
I don't know.

42:37.303 --> 42:38.846
Oh, boy.

42:56.281 --> 42:59.117
Run, Scoob! It's a "skelly" thingy!

43:10.962 --> 43:12.130
Elevator.

43:12.630 --> 43:14.215
Good work, pal!

43:14.966 --> 43:16.843
Like, let's skedaddle.

43:24.100 --> 43:26.602
So, what's your assessment, Velmster?

43:26.811 --> 43:29.313
This place seems harmless enough.

43:29.480 --> 43:33.359
I mean, whether the Evil Masked Figure
could've gotten his randamonium...

43:33.526 --> 43:35.570
- ...from here at the mine?
- Oh, sorry.

43:35.737 --> 43:38.823
I was just thinking about Patrick.

43:38.990 --> 43:41.325
He seemed so upset when he left.

43:41.659 --> 43:43.703
- Right. So....
- And...

43:45.580 --> 43:47.248
...he doesn't like me.

43:47.415 --> 43:50.418
Okay. So your assessment is?

43:51.335 --> 43:54.756
- Love stinks.
- Fred?

43:54.964 --> 43:56.966
Do you think I'm just a pretty face?

43:57.175 --> 43:58.217
No.

43:59.051 --> 44:00.511
I mean, yes.

44:01.012 --> 44:02.472
I mean, not fat!

44:02.638 --> 44:05.892
Definitely not fat.
Is this sort of what you're looking for?

44:06.058 --> 44:08.686
Fat? Why would you even use that word?

44:10.021 --> 44:13.691
Never again will they underestimate us.
That's right.

44:13.858 --> 44:16.861
I've gathered you here today
for something big.

44:17.195 --> 44:18.654
At last.

44:18.821 --> 44:21.574
All these years of careful planning...

44:21.741 --> 44:26.162
...have culminated
in this one glorious moment.

44:27.079 --> 44:31.501
Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed
in your foul monster-making scheme.

44:31.667 --> 44:34.420
With your ugly, evil henchmen.

44:35.755 --> 44:37.048
Henchmen?

44:38.049 --> 44:41.928
Young man, we're investors,
and we're listening to his pitch.

44:42.386 --> 44:44.138
So as I was saying...

44:44.305 --> 44:47.099
...the Old Tyme Mining Town,
a summer camp for kids...

44:47.266 --> 44:50.061
...where they can have
an authentic mining experience.

44:50.436 --> 44:55.399
They can dig for 18 hours straight,
just like in the golden days of yore.

44:55.566 --> 44:59.403
They have the time of their lives,
and we get free miners!

45:00.238 --> 45:02.615
Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...

45:02.782 --> 45:07.078
- ...your ties to recent monster attacks.
- I don't know nothing about no monsters.

45:07.245 --> 45:10.665
Then how come there was randamonium
on the floor of your mansion?

45:10.831 --> 45:15.044
There's randamonium all over the place.
I come home with it in my shorts.

45:15.419 --> 45:18.714
Are you continuing the work
of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?

45:18.881 --> 45:21.217
Old pal? Jacobo?

45:21.384 --> 45:23.219
We hated each other.

45:23.386 --> 45:26.597
In the prison cafeteria,
he used to steal my Tater Tots!

45:26.764 --> 45:28.933
<i>And he got the lead in My Fair Lady.</i>

45:29.100 --> 45:31.936
Then why did we find the monster book
in your library?

45:32.103 --> 45:35.273
Wait a second. You're the runts
what vandalized my home.

45:36.941 --> 45:39.443
Which one of you stole my toilet brush?

45:40.111 --> 45:41.487
Gentlemen.

45:42.655 --> 45:45.658
- I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
- What happened? I haven't finished!

45:45.825 --> 45:47.285
Wait, fellas!

45:47.952 --> 45:51.956
Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
I think we're onto something.

45:53.958 --> 45:56.335
It's like a huge laboratory.

46:00.756 --> 46:02.133
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.685
This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.

46:18.524 --> 46:20.318
Refrigerator!

46:24.822 --> 46:26.365
Lemonade!

46:31.203 --> 46:34.540
Check it out.
Look at those weird letters, Scoob.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.168
Shaggy?

46:40.171 --> 46:44.633
Scooby-Doo,
you turned into a freaky monster.

46:46.177 --> 46:48.471
You don't eat stuff that glows.

46:48.637 --> 46:51.849
There's got to be an antidote
in here somewhere.

46:52.016 --> 46:54.643
Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.

46:59.190 --> 47:00.649
Tastes like--

47:04.361 --> 47:05.905
Strawberries.

47:08.991 --> 47:10.910
I'm okay, Scoob.

47:18.709 --> 47:21.045
I've got a chick's body!

47:22.379 --> 47:24.757
I'm the Tasmanian Devil!

47:43.234 --> 47:45.236
Check it out, dude!

47:46.111 --> 47:48.030
I'm buff.

47:48.697 --> 47:50.366
My God.

47:50.616 --> 47:54.453
It seems as if I've become
ludicrously intelligent.

47:54.620 --> 47:57.957
It's awful! I long for the blissful ignorance
of my former self.

47:58.123 --> 48:01.377
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end,
eating my own vomit.

48:01.544 --> 48:04.129
Those were wonderful times.

48:04.296 --> 48:07.049
Check out my pecs, little man!

48:09.093 --> 48:13.055
Hush now, buffoon.
This is a highly combustible synthesis.

48:13.222 --> 48:14.265
A what?

48:14.431 --> 48:16.433
I'm going to transform us back!

48:16.600 --> 48:17.935
No way, geek!

48:19.103 --> 48:22.273
I'm gonna stay this way forever!

48:22.815 --> 48:23.941
No!

48:27.111 --> 48:28.279
Let's go!

48:33.117 --> 48:34.618
Careful, gang.

48:41.333 --> 48:44.628
This "Schwarzeneggian" oaf
almost destroyed us.

48:45.796 --> 48:47.298
Go boom.

48:48.257 --> 48:50.092
You are embarrassing.

49:04.315 --> 49:07.318
That was almost exactly like
my freshman year in college.

49:07.484 --> 49:10.863
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.

49:11.030 --> 49:12.614
I invented a potion.

49:12.948 --> 49:14.491
You lied to us. We're a team.

49:14.658 --> 49:17.703
You don't just go off half-cocked
doing whatever you want.

49:17.870 --> 49:19.121
Hey, gang.

49:20.164 --> 49:23.751
"Beware who enters the Monster Hive.

49:24.376 --> 49:27.671
Inside your fears will come alive."

49:36.555 --> 49:37.973
Oh, my.

49:38.349 --> 49:41.602
Look! It's the costumes
from the museum!

49:41.769 --> 49:44.521
- Zombie.
- Miner 49er.

49:44.688 --> 49:47.858
- Captain Cutler.
- I bet they're all here.

49:48.067 --> 49:52.905
He must have used the costumes
to make real monsters, which implies....

49:53.072 --> 49:56.408
He needs the costumes to make
the monsters, which implies....

49:56.575 --> 50:01.872
He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost
costume somehow, which implies....

50:05.042 --> 50:07.336
Patrick's the one.

50:07.503 --> 50:09.004
Velma's in love.

50:09.213 --> 50:11.673
No, I mean the one.

50:12.508 --> 50:13.717
The bad guy.

50:14.843 --> 50:17.596
That's why he wanted to go out with me.

50:19.389 --> 50:21.058
To see what we knew.

50:21.225 --> 50:24.019
We just saw Patrick
at the bad guys' hangout.

50:24.186 --> 50:27.397
He was working both sides
of Psycho Street.

50:27.564 --> 50:30.192
I don't know who's behind this,
but we don't need him...

50:30.359 --> 50:31.693
...transforming more costumes.

50:31.860 --> 50:34.905
Let's find a way to shut down
this monster-maker for good.

50:35.072 --> 50:37.407
Guys? What's over here?

50:37.574 --> 50:39.743
This light is strange.

50:40.702 --> 50:41.745
Scooby-Doo.

50:42.204 --> 50:45.916
We're the ones that found this place.
Score one for the big guys!

50:46.458 --> 50:50.587
Now we need to keep acting
like mondo-groovy detectives. Come on.

51:03.308 --> 51:04.434
Like, wowee.

51:12.818 --> 51:15.237
Cool! Like, "tuneage."

51:41.638 --> 51:43.974
Like, what's that weird sound?

51:47.019 --> 51:48.437
Captain Cutler!

51:49.146 --> 51:50.647
Miner 49er!

51:51.356 --> 51:53.442
The Tar Monster!

51:54.443 --> 51:55.652
We have...

51:56.194 --> 51:58.155
...to remain...

51:58.655 --> 51:59.865
...calm.

52:00.782 --> 52:03.201
Calm, Scooby-Doo!
You're not being calm!

52:04.494 --> 52:07.497
I needed that.
I needed that too.

52:07.664 --> 52:09.833
You're pushing your luck, Scoob!

52:16.048 --> 52:18.300
You girls find anything?

52:20.344 --> 52:22.679
- He did it.
- Scoob!

52:23.013 --> 52:25.349
Fred, disconnect that control panel!

52:25.515 --> 52:27.851
Maybe it'll stop the machine!

52:57.547 --> 53:01.009
Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!

53:03.720 --> 53:07.057
- Like, The 10,000 Volt Ghost!
- Come on, Scoob!

53:08.558 --> 53:09.684
We're gonna die!

53:09.851 --> 53:12.229
- Think positive!
- We're gonna die quickly!

53:12.854 --> 53:14.773
Wait for me!

53:31.998 --> 53:33.125
Come on, girls!

53:35.919 --> 53:38.922
- An exit!
- Run, Shaggy!

53:50.308 --> 53:52.102
Stop them!

53:52.769 --> 53:57.983
Destroy the city if you have to,
but get me that control panel!

53:58.150 --> 54:02.904
With it, they can destroy everything
I've set out to do.

54:03.071 --> 54:05.740
Hurry up, gang.
We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.

54:05.907 --> 54:08.827
End of the line, Mystery Inc.!

54:10.912 --> 54:11.955
Die!

54:18.295 --> 54:20.088
Let's book, Scoob.

54:25.802 --> 54:26.970
Oh, boy.

54:29.097 --> 54:30.515
Let's rip it, Scoob!

54:31.099 --> 54:32.434
Zoinks!

54:48.658 --> 54:49.951
I don't know.

54:52.871 --> 54:54.164
Banzai!

54:55.332 --> 54:56.958
We're getting rad!

54:57.626 --> 55:00.670
Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
Zoinks!

55:31.701 --> 55:32.744
Hello.

55:45.215 --> 55:46.424
Scooby!

55:56.601 --> 55:57.727
Are you guys okay?

55:58.228 --> 56:03.108
Sure. As long as you define "okay"
as "in massive agony."

56:04.692 --> 56:06.569
We should get back to headquarters.

56:06.736 --> 56:09.406
No! That'll be the first place
they'll look for us.

56:09.572 --> 56:11.116
I think I know where to go.

56:13.076 --> 56:15.703
Move that worthless piece of tin!

56:16.037 --> 56:19.749
Unlike some of you,
I have a very important meeting!

56:31.594 --> 56:35.306
Citizens! Turn in Mystery Inc.

56:35.473 --> 56:40.145
Your reward: We'll let you live.

56:42.814 --> 56:47.485
My monsters can make life
very unpleasant.

56:57.954 --> 57:02.917
Find me Mystery Inc., now.

57:03.418 --> 57:07.630
Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency
update for Investigative Probe.

57:07.797 --> 57:10.425
A monster army has invaded Coolsville.

57:10.592 --> 57:14.470
<i>Angry citizens have gathered
outside Mystery Inc. 's offices in protest.</i>

57:14.637 --> 57:18.600
<i>They're insisting the gang cooperate
with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.</i>

57:18.766 --> 57:20.977
<i>Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!</i>

57:24.981 --> 57:28.151
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

57:36.659 --> 57:38.536
<i>I beg you, Mystery Inc.</i>

57:38.703 --> 57:42.165
<i>If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.</i>

57:42.332 --> 57:46.794
If we do, he'll get the control panel back,
and the city will be in worse shape.

57:46.961 --> 57:49.797
We'd be playing right into his hands.

57:49.964 --> 57:53.051
Please. For our city's sake.

58:00.016 --> 58:03.019
<i>Sorry. You're cancelled.</i>

58:30.421 --> 58:33.341
The old high-school clubhouse.

58:36.219 --> 58:37.845
We should be safe here.

58:38.012 --> 58:40.640
We haven't been here in years.

58:49.899 --> 58:51.526
Freddy, are you okay?

58:52.360 --> 58:55.822
- Do you wanna talk?
- Talking's for wimps.

59:01.077 --> 59:02.787
It's time for action.

59:05.498 --> 59:06.874
You know, Scoob...

59:07.041 --> 59:11.629
...this Evil Masked Figure
is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.

59:11.879 --> 59:14.841
And the gang is totally taking a hit for it.

59:16.676 --> 59:20.680
Like, this is the most "our-faultiest"
screwup ever, Scoob.

59:25.059 --> 59:26.686
Still works.

59:28.146 --> 59:31.023
Look, all my old tools.

59:33.192 --> 59:36.237
After all our so-called success...

59:36.404 --> 59:38.573
...we're back in this old firetrap.

59:53.963 --> 59:56.174
Hit me, Fred.

01:00:04.307 --> 01:00:05.558
Good throw, Velm!

01:00:05.725 --> 01:00:08.227
- Mine.
- Gotcha!

01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:14.525
Throw it to me!

01:00:14.692 --> 01:00:16.277
- Go long!
- Okay.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.405
Go, Scooby-Doo!

01:00:20.239 --> 01:00:21.741
Dude!

01:00:26.996 --> 01:00:29.498
It all seemed so easy back then.

01:00:32.335 --> 01:00:37.089
We solved mysteries for the love of them,
not to prove anything to anyone.

01:00:38.341 --> 01:00:42.970
And the mysteries all seemed
to unravel themselves.

01:00:43.137 --> 01:00:46.974
Sometimes, the answers
would just appear like magic.

01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:52.021
My first multiple-resonance
imaging device.

01:00:52.188 --> 01:00:56.108
Made out of a crystal radio
and old video games.

01:00:57.985 --> 01:00:59.528
Wait a minute.

01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:04.825
Randamonium has an algorithmic
cross-currency of negative 4.121.

01:01:05.368 --> 01:01:07.536
With it, maybe....
Well, just maybe--

01:01:07.703 --> 01:01:11.666
We could reverse the current
and reverse the monster-making process!

01:01:11.832 --> 01:01:14.251
All we need to do
is rewire the control panel--

01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:17.546
Bring it back to the Monster Hive
and plug it into the base.

01:01:17.713 --> 01:01:20.591
- Push the button--
- And instead of creating monsters...

01:01:20.758 --> 01:01:22.843
...all the monsters will be destroyed.

01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:59.004
Like, they're totally having
a montage in there without us.

01:02:00.423 --> 01:02:05.052
I'll tell you one thing for sure.
They don't need our help to figure it out.

01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:06.929
We're screwups.

01:02:07.096 --> 01:02:08.889
The only time we do anything right...

01:02:09.056 --> 01:02:11.809
...is when we accidentally plow
into the Snow Ghost...

01:02:11.976 --> 01:02:16.605
...because we've accidentally glued our
feet to rocket-powered roller-skates.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.275
Eight stupid times.

01:02:20.776 --> 01:02:22.278
Face it, Scoob.

01:02:22.445 --> 01:02:25.781
We'll never be anything
but our old goofy selves.

01:02:26.615 --> 01:02:28.617
I wish once...

01:02:28.784 --> 01:02:30.578
...just once...

01:02:30.911 --> 01:02:33.622
...I could do the right thing on purpose.

01:02:35.291 --> 01:02:36.625
You know, Scoob?

01:02:38.627 --> 01:02:40.463
Like, be a hero...

01:02:41.297 --> 01:02:43.132
...and save the day.

01:02:45.634 --> 01:02:47.636
But who are we kidding, right?

01:02:59.815 --> 01:03:01.400
Captain Cutler's Ghost.

01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:06.405
Captain Cutler's Ghost!

01:03:07.781 --> 01:03:11.911
They found us. Finish that in the van
when we get to the Monster Hive.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:17.374
- Come on, guys! In the van!
- Hurry!

01:03:19.919 --> 01:03:22.338
Go, Fred! Hit it!

01:03:33.182 --> 01:03:34.767
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

01:03:34.934 --> 01:03:36.685
Fine. Let's go back!

01:03:38.145 --> 01:03:39.939
That's the wrong way!

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.870
Shaggy! Give me a hand.

01:03:55.037 --> 01:03:57.706
This is tied for
the most terrifying day of my life.

01:03:57.873 --> 01:04:01.126
- Tied with what?
- Every other freaking day of my life!

01:04:01.293 --> 01:04:02.336
It's done!

01:04:12.221 --> 01:04:14.223
Jinkies! Tweety's back.

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:15.599
- Shaggy!
- Yeah?

01:04:15.766 --> 01:04:18.477
I'm putting her in cruise.
Take the wheel.

01:04:18.644 --> 01:04:20.229
Go!

01:04:31.323 --> 01:04:32.366
Take this!

01:04:35.577 --> 01:04:38.330
- This is bad.
- No doubt.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.749
- Shaggy?
- Yeah.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:42.418
Who's driving?

01:04:44.003 --> 01:04:45.045
Hello.

01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:46.422
- Scoob.
- What?

01:05:02.688 --> 01:05:05.023
- Turn the wheel!
- Wheel?

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.609
- Turn the wheel!
- The round thing, Scoob!

01:05:14.199 --> 01:05:16.577
- Scooby!
- Okay.

01:05:25.043 --> 01:05:26.587
I'm driving!

01:05:34.636 --> 01:05:35.971
Watch out, Scoob!

01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:43.437
You did it, Scoob!

01:05:49.318 --> 01:05:52.821
All right, gang.
The Monster Hive is right over there.

01:05:52.988 --> 01:05:55.574
Let's get this control panel
and plug her in.

01:06:10.422 --> 01:06:13.592
You go nowhere, knave.

01:06:14.843 --> 01:06:17.012
You guys take the long way around.

01:06:18.347 --> 01:06:19.765
And I'll hold him off.

01:06:22.351 --> 01:06:25.521
- Come on.
- Go get him, Fred.

01:07:35.048 --> 01:07:37.676
- Come on, Daph!
- I'm coming!

01:07:40.178 --> 01:07:42.556
Not so fast!

01:07:44.725 --> 01:07:49.104
You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
Just get that control panel to the Hive.

01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:51.440
- Go!
- We've got it, Daph!

01:08:03.452 --> 01:08:04.870
Scary.

01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:07.456
Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.

01:08:23.345 --> 01:08:24.389
Daph?

01:08:25.474 --> 01:08:28.435
- Daph, are you okay?
- I think so.

01:08:32.606 --> 01:08:34.483
Guess this is it, huh?

01:08:35.108 --> 01:08:36.443
Oh, baby.

01:08:38.487 --> 01:08:40.322
I'm afraid.

01:08:42.657 --> 01:08:44.283
What a wimp, huh?

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:47.578
That doesn't make you a wimp.

01:08:48.997 --> 01:08:50.999
Makes you human.

01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:57.798
The Skeleton Men.

01:08:59.758 --> 01:09:02.844
- He does that when he gets nervous.
- Sorry.

01:09:16.816 --> 01:09:20.111
- Here, Shaggy, take this.
- Why are you giving this to me?

01:09:20.278 --> 01:09:22.447
I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.

01:09:22.613 --> 01:09:25.700
- Get this to the Monster Hive.
- Us?

01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:27.160
You're faster than me.

01:09:27.327 --> 01:09:30.872
Once there, just plug it into the base.
Push this button.

01:09:31.038 --> 01:09:33.792
I fixed it so it will destroy
all the monsters.

01:09:34.626 --> 01:09:36.044
But...

01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:39.589
- ...we can't.
- We're screwups.

01:09:39.756 --> 01:09:42.425
We tried to be heroes like you guys,
but we're not.

01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:44.386
- We're just not.
- No.

01:09:44.553 --> 01:09:46.011
Like me?

01:09:49.224 --> 01:09:53.019
That's funny.
I always wanted to be like you guys.

01:09:54.187 --> 01:09:58.733
You guys are so free. You're never afraid
to be who you really are.

01:09:58.984 --> 01:10:03.905
Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.

01:10:05.323 --> 01:10:07.575
I think you've been heroes all along.

01:10:08.576 --> 01:10:10.328
You just haven't known it.

01:10:13.873 --> 01:10:14.916
Here I go.

01:10:19.504 --> 01:10:21.006
Heroes.

01:10:21.673 --> 01:10:23.091
Heroes.

01:10:23.425 --> 01:10:25.719
On your knees, knave.

01:10:25.885 --> 01:10:27.554
Can't you see we're talking?

01:10:28.722 --> 01:10:31.099
Talking is for wimps.

01:10:33.435 --> 01:10:36.187
You can't fool me
with that macho façade.

01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:40.108
You're just afraid to show
your sensitive side.

01:10:41.276 --> 01:10:43.528
You've touched my inner child.

01:10:44.738 --> 01:10:46.448
And he's really mad!

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:49.951
Come on, Scoob.

01:10:53.455 --> 01:10:57.083
Miner 49er!

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.310
I'll get you, you varmints!

01:11:43.004 --> 01:11:45.006
Dead end.

01:11:47.509 --> 01:11:50.678
Remember when we were young
and you used to wear that jumper?

01:11:52.347 --> 01:11:55.642
- What? Me? In a jumper?
- And we used to watch cable?

01:12:02.774 --> 01:12:03.858
Do it!

01:12:09.197 --> 01:12:10.615
Lights out.

01:12:15.537 --> 01:12:17.038
Blackout! Blackout!

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.383
Oh, crap.

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:52.073
Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.

01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:05.420
Come on. Let's go, Scoob!

01:13:08.423 --> 01:13:10.216
My glasses.

01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:13.595
Oh, brother. Not again.

01:13:14.262 --> 01:13:16.931
I've got to consider contact lenses.

01:13:17.724 --> 01:13:18.766
What?

01:13:36.451 --> 01:13:40.121
Some kind of scary bat.

01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:43.458
Wait a minute.

01:13:46.377 --> 01:13:47.962
That's the pterodactyl.

01:13:49.714 --> 01:13:51.716
The Pterodactyl Ghost.

01:13:55.136 --> 01:13:56.637
What's this?

01:14:15.073 --> 01:14:16.491
A shrine!

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:19.994
To Jonathan Jacobo?

01:14:21.662 --> 01:14:24.332
But who would be so obsessed with him?

01:14:29.587 --> 01:14:30.630
Velma.

01:14:32.465 --> 01:14:33.591
Lose something?

01:14:44.018 --> 01:14:45.186
Patrick.

01:14:49.524 --> 01:14:51.025
What are you doing here?

01:14:52.026 --> 01:14:54.695
I'm trying to solve this mystery.
Same as you.

01:14:56.155 --> 01:15:00.034
That is what you're doing, right?
Trying to solve this mystery?

01:15:00.201 --> 01:15:01.577
Yes.

01:15:03.371 --> 01:15:06.666
Why are you so obsessed
with Jonathan Jacobo?

01:15:08.793 --> 01:15:11.796
- What are you talking about?
- No way, Jose.

01:15:12.171 --> 01:15:13.381
Velma.

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:20.638
Stay away from me.

01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:23.224
I know who you are.

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:34.735
- Velma, let go of the grate.
- So I can fall to my death?

01:15:34.902 --> 01:15:36.571
No, so I can pull you up.

01:15:39.907 --> 01:15:43.578
- You gotta trust me.
- No. I only trust the facts.

01:15:43.744 --> 01:15:46.998
And all the facts say
that you're the Evil Masked Figure.

01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:50.376
What does your heart say?

01:15:50.543 --> 01:15:54.714
I don't know.
It's beating too loud for me to hear.

01:15:55.923 --> 01:15:58.593
Look deeper. You gotta trust me.

01:16:13.566 --> 01:16:14.942
You saved my life.

01:16:18.279 --> 01:16:19.530
Patrick!

01:16:23.117 --> 01:16:24.201
Velma!

01:16:24.452 --> 01:16:26.454
That thing just flew off with Patrick!

01:16:26.621 --> 01:16:30.791
The best we can do for him is get
that control panel back where it belongs.

01:16:32.543 --> 01:16:33.711
Where is it?

01:16:35.796 --> 01:16:38.716
I gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

01:16:39.467 --> 01:16:43.888
That's weird. It sounded like you just said
you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.942
I think we lost them.

01:16:58.652 --> 01:17:01.072
Scoob, we made it.

01:17:02.323 --> 01:17:05.409
You should never have locked those locks.

01:17:05.576 --> 01:17:08.162
Now you're stuck in here with me!

01:17:08.329 --> 01:17:11.165
The Cotton Candy Glob.

01:17:11.374 --> 01:17:14.585
- Cotton Candy Glob?
- Cotton Candy Glob?

01:17:15.628 --> 01:17:17.338
Yes.

01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:28.974
- No! I'll give you cavities!
- I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.

01:17:29.141 --> 01:17:32.353
Poor guys are probably running around
helpless and terrified.

01:17:36.065 --> 01:17:39.693
This is like the greatest day
of our lives, Scoob.

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.822
Finally, a monster
we could sink our teeth into.

01:17:42.988 --> 01:17:47.868
I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's
a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?

01:17:48.035 --> 01:17:51.372
- Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
- Come on.

01:17:51.539 --> 01:17:54.291
We have to get this
control panel back before....

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:03.259
Before exactly that happens.

01:18:03.425 --> 01:18:07.221
At last I have you, Mystery Inc.

01:18:07.805 --> 01:18:11.934
You'll never make it past my monsters.

01:18:12.101 --> 01:18:15.437
We've taken these jerks before, gang.
Let's do it again.

01:18:19.942 --> 01:18:24.238
- Fred!
- It's not them you need to worry about.

01:18:26.574 --> 01:18:28.576
Now you are stuck in my trap.

01:18:29.368 --> 01:18:30.536
Daphne!

01:18:33.873 --> 01:18:34.999
Daph!

01:18:40.713 --> 01:18:42.172
Gotcha!

01:18:43.924 --> 01:18:45.426
Go! Daphne!

01:18:45.843 --> 01:18:50.848
Run, Velma! Run, Velma!

01:18:51.765 --> 01:18:53.601
Shaggy! Here!

01:18:56.061 --> 01:18:57.104
Come on!

01:19:00.608 --> 01:19:03.819
Soon your friends will be dead...

01:19:03.986 --> 01:19:05.863
...and Coolsville destroyed.

01:19:06.614 --> 01:19:08.699
My revenge will be final...

01:19:09.366 --> 01:19:12.786
...and there's nothing you can do about it.

01:19:13.287 --> 01:19:14.496
Help, Velma!

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:18.626
Daphne?

01:19:20.878 --> 01:19:23.714
- Shaggy?
- Scoob....

01:19:38.896 --> 01:19:40.648
Dude.

01:19:47.488 --> 01:19:51.325
- Like, frostbite never felt so good!
- Stop them!

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.913
- Go long, Scoob!
- Okay.

01:19:58.999 --> 01:20:00.751
Here, doggy-doggy.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.046
Rail glide!

01:20:04.213 --> 01:20:07.341
- Watch this!
- Roll barrel!

01:20:15.474 --> 01:20:16.850
Hang time!

01:20:20.104 --> 01:20:22.981
End of the line, Doo!

01:20:23.816 --> 01:20:26.318
Come here, you worthless mutt!

01:20:53.178 --> 01:20:54.221
Scoob!

01:21:01.353 --> 01:21:03.272
You can do it, buddy!

01:21:15.617 --> 01:21:18.704
You can't do this to me!

01:21:18.871 --> 01:21:21.582
Who do you think you are?

01:21:22.416 --> 01:21:23.792
Scooby...

01:21:23.959 --> 01:21:25.169
...Dooby...

01:21:25.335 --> 01:21:26.378
...Doo!

01:21:30.424 --> 01:21:32.092
No!

01:21:57.409 --> 01:21:59.286
My monsters!

01:22:06.585 --> 01:22:09.254
You did it! You saved us all!

01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:10.714
I know.

01:22:21.099 --> 01:22:24.478
Do you know the identity
of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?

01:22:24.645 --> 01:22:27.940
If our hunch is correct,
the Evil Masked Figure is....

01:22:28.106 --> 01:22:29.316
No!

01:22:33.987 --> 01:22:35.322
Heather Jasper-Howe.

01:22:38.158 --> 01:22:40.994
But she was at the museum
when the Masked Figure was on the roof.

01:22:41.161 --> 01:22:43.163
You almost had me there, didn't you?

01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:46.875
Lucky for her, she had an assistant
helping her with her evil plans.

01:22:48.627 --> 01:22:49.670
Ned.

01:22:52.673 --> 01:22:55.217
<i>When I realized
she was the Evil Masked Figure...</i>

01:22:55.384 --> 01:22:57.719
<i>...he quickly changed into her costume.</i>

01:22:57.886 --> 01:22:59.054
But why did she do it?

01:22:59.221 --> 01:23:03.600
Because Heather Jasper-Howe
is actually...

01:23:07.813 --> 01:23:10.315
...Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.

01:23:11.024 --> 01:23:13.402
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

01:23:13.568 --> 01:23:15.195
But how do you know this?

01:23:15.362 --> 01:23:19.658
A photo, taken of Jacobo
in front of the Coolsonian.

01:23:19.825 --> 01:23:23.203
Jacobo supposedly died
a year before construction even began.

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:26.873
So Jacobo survived that fall
off the prison wall.

01:23:27.374 --> 01:23:31.753
He adapted the false Heather Jasper-Howe
persona to turn the press against us.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.672
Then he framed Old Man Wickles...

01:23:33.839 --> 01:23:37.300
...by putting that book and
The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.

01:23:37.467 --> 01:23:40.679
<i>As if you getting the lead
in My Fair Lady wasn't enough!</i>

01:23:40.846 --> 01:23:44.766
I was an excellent Eliza!
You were too act-y.

01:23:44.933 --> 01:23:46.893
And stealing my Tater Tots!

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.104
You kept saying you felt puffy!

01:23:50.147 --> 01:23:53.275
And the real identity of Ned is....

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:57.779
Ned.

01:24:00.198 --> 01:24:04.327
I would have gotten away with it
if it weren't for those meddling punks...

01:24:04.494 --> 01:24:06.037
...and their dumb dog!

01:24:11.251 --> 01:24:15.255
<i>- You were a dude this whole time?
- Of course, dummkopf.</i>

01:24:16.089 --> 01:24:17.716
But we cuddled.

01:24:23.597 --> 01:24:25.807
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:27.058 --> 01:24:30.478
Listen, Velma, I know
that must have seemed very suspicious...

01:24:30.645 --> 01:24:33.940
...but you've got to believe me
that I had nothing to do with--

01:24:34.941 --> 01:24:36.443
I trust you.

01:24:37.235 --> 01:24:38.820
Listen, Patrick.

01:24:40.071 --> 01:24:43.909
I'm not glamorous or mysterious.

01:24:44.618 --> 01:24:46.328
But one thing that's true is...

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.332
...that I like you.

01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:52.918
Very much.

01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:58.173
And I would like
to go out with you again.

01:24:59.007 --> 01:25:02.302
But this time, I will go as myself.

01:25:05.597 --> 01:25:08.892
Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.

01:25:10.268 --> 01:25:11.478
Okay.

01:25:15.232 --> 01:25:18.693
<i>Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!</i>

01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:22.489
They're cheering for us again.

01:25:22.697 --> 01:25:23.740
Yep.

01:25:23.907 --> 01:25:27.160
I always thought that was
the best thing in the world.

01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:29.788
I guess I found something
a little bit better.

01:25:31.998 --> 01:25:35.585
- Can we get your photo in this?
- Yes.

01:25:44.052 --> 01:25:46.388
Yikes! A monster!

01:25:52.102 --> 01:25:55.647
- Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
- Shaggy!

01:26:05.573 --> 01:26:08.201
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:26:10.495 --> 01:26:12.330
Sing it up, Ruben.

01:26:16.751 --> 01:26:17.794
Everybody.

01:26:40.024 --> 01:26:41.484
Come on, Shaggy.

01:26:44.446 --> 01:26:45.947
Get down.

01:32:23.868 --> 01:32:26.287
Game Boy Advance secret code.
