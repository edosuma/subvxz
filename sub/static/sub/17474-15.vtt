00:01.750 --> 00:03.218
Previously on <i>Smash...</i>

00:03.252 --> 00:05.086
Three days ago, you told me
you loved me.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.556
Rebecca needs my attention and
I'm giving it to her.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.057
Dev and I got into a huge
fight last night.

00:10.092 --> 00:12.559
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

00:12.594 --> 00:13.793
Is the offer still
on the table?

00:13.828 --> 00:15.061
Can we get married?

00:15.096 --> 00:16.296
Go get that ring.

00:16.331 --> 00:18.432
I think I left
something in your room.

00:18.466 --> 00:20.100
The real problem is Rebecca.

00:20.134 --> 00:21.235
That's the end?

00:21.269 --> 00:23.002
No one applauded.

00:23.037 --> 00:26.172
We're gonna need that new
ending by Monday morning.

00:26.207 --> 00:28.774
That stupid song
will be finished!

00:28.808 --> 00:29.975
My God.

00:30.009 --> 00:31.076
Rebecca?

00:31.111 --> 00:33.412
Someone tried to poison her.

00:33.447 --> 00:35.581
I'm not going back
into the show.

00:35.616 --> 00:37.983
The real question is who's
going to play Marilyn?

00:41.955 --> 00:44.155
- Okay.
- No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:44.189 --> 00:45.490
This is it.
No, it's not.

00:45.524 --> 00:48.526
Yes, we don't
need... look, look.

00:48.561 --> 00:51.329
Julia, look.

00:51.364 --> 00:53.265
Go.

00:53.299 --> 00:54.299
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.867
- Sorry, sorry.
- Pardon.

00:55.901 --> 00:57.034
Pardon me.
Sorry.

00:57.069 --> 00:58.102
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

00:58.137 --> 00:59.270
Excuse us. Sorry.

00:59.304 --> 01:00.537
- Program!
- Yes, thank you.

01:00.572 --> 01:02.005
Sorry.

01:02.039 --> 01:04.375
- You all right?
- Yup.

01:04.409 --> 01:05.842
- Okay, excuse us.
- Sorry.

01:05.877 --> 01:06.877
- So, so sorry.
- Sorry.

01:06.911 --> 01:08.812
Go, go, go.

01:08.846 --> 01:10.881
This is your 15 minute call,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:10.915 --> 01:12.783
Your 15 minute call.

01:12.817 --> 01:14.351
15 minutes.

01:14.386 --> 01:15.518
Where's Marilyn?

01:15.552 --> 01:17.219
Make sure you get this to her.

01:17.254 --> 01:19.255
Break a leg.

01:22.159 --> 01:23.726
Break a leg.

01:23.761 --> 01:25.762
You're gonna be great.

01:27.398 --> 01:30.700
Places, please, places.

01:30.734 --> 01:31.800
Break a leg, sweetie.

01:31.834 --> 01:34.203
You're going to be wonderful.

01:35.237 --> 01:37.238
Break a leg.

01:58.226 --> 01:59.493
I will not be bullied into
making a decision

01:59.528 --> 02:00.695
with this much riding on it.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.730
Bullying, coming from you,
is frankly ridiculous.

02:02.764 --> 02:03.730
This is not about bullying.

02:03.764 --> 02:05.231
There's just no time.

02:05.265 --> 02:07.033
Well, let's buy ourselves
some more time.

02:07.067 --> 02:08.100
You know how much
that's gonna cost?

02:08.134 --> 02:09.235
Half a million dollars.

02:09.269 --> 02:10.402
I'm not talking about a week.

02:10.437 --> 02:12.205
I'm talking about one day.

02:12.239 --> 02:14.507
We have a rough melody,
we have some lyrics.

02:14.542 --> 02:16.343
What we don't have
is a Marilyn to...

02:16.377 --> 02:18.545
Another delay and the press is
gonna annihilate us.

02:18.579 --> 02:20.178
They've already
annihilated us.

02:20.213 --> 02:23.882
God, enough!

02:23.916 --> 02:26.518
Enough!

02:26.553 --> 02:28.954
Great.

02:28.988 --> 02:30.255
Derek just stormed out.

02:30.289 --> 02:32.290
My God.

02:42.968 --> 02:45.636
- Eileen?
- This is a nightmare.

02:45.671 --> 02:47.572
It's <i>The Post.</i>

02:47.606 --> 02:49.607
You know who.

02:51.509 --> 02:53.477
Hello, Michael Riedel!

02:53.511 --> 02:54.978
Hi, darling.

02:55.012 --> 02:56.880
Well, of course
we're disappointed.

02:56.914 --> 03:00.149
But our main concern is that
Rebecca gets some rest.

03:00.184 --> 03:04.087
The good news is she's gonna be
absolutely fine

03:04.121 --> 03:08.056
and we have a thrilling Marilyn
waiting in the wings.

03:08.091 --> 03:11.660
No, we're not ready to release
her name just yet.

03:11.695 --> 03:15.398
Of course, you'll be
the first to know.

03:15.432 --> 03:18.434
Okay, you take care. Bye.

03:23.806 --> 03:26.007
They're gonna ask
you to do it.

03:26.041 --> 03:29.110
We don't know what
they're gonna do.

03:34.983 --> 03:35.983
It's my mom.

03:36.018 --> 03:38.653
It's my fiance.

03:38.687 --> 03:40.854
Fiance.

03:40.889 --> 03:41.955
- Well.
- Mom.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.458
Have they asked you to do it?

03:44.492 --> 03:45.626
They have and understudy, mom.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.993
Her name's Karen.

03:47.028 --> 03:48.662
Don't talk to me about
understudies.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.964
They don't get rehearsed in
until after previews

03:50.998 --> 03:52.966
and you already know it.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.535
Well, I can't think
about that now.

03:54.569 --> 03:56.803
You don't need to.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.439
Everyone else is.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.475
I need to see
Marilyn's costumes.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.547
Okay, thank you.

04:46.884 --> 04:47.851
Company to the stage.

04:47.885 --> 04:49.752
Tom, Julia.

04:49.787 --> 04:51.388
Where's Eileen?

04:51.422 --> 04:53.423
Eileen?

05:04.468 --> 05:06.535
Where's Karen Cartwright?

05:06.569 --> 05:07.703
Here.

05:07.737 --> 05:09.605
I'm here.

05:09.639 --> 05:11.840
You're going on as Marilyn.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.876
Tonight.

05:27.677 --> 05:29.777
SMASH
Season finale - Bombshell

05:30.439 --> 05:33.939
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

05:35.717 --> 05:36.817
We want her to go on tonight?

05:36.851 --> 05:38.186
She is going on tonight.

05:38.220 --> 05:39.287
Nothing fits.

05:39.321 --> 05:40.555
Rebecca's, like, a foot taller.

05:40.589 --> 05:41.556
Okay, there's at
least one dress

05:41.590 --> 05:42.557
back there that fits her.

05:42.591 --> 05:43.824
Simon, I need that wig!

05:43.858 --> 05:46.194
There's a lot of stuff
she doesn't know.

05:46.228 --> 05:47.328
I know all the songs.

05:47.362 --> 05:48.328
Derek told me to keep up

05:48.362 --> 05:49.862
and learn them all.

05:49.897 --> 05:51.531
Are we even gonna be able
to run everything?

05:51.566 --> 05:53.967
- Yes.
- Josh, where is the wig?

05:54.001 --> 05:56.169
We're looking, Derek.

05:56.204 --> 05:58.705
This is gonna be hard.

05:58.739 --> 06:02.008
If you feel yourself panicking,
ask for help.

06:02.042 --> 06:04.310
Everyone loves you here and they
want you to succeed.

06:04.344 --> 06:08.647
Thank you.

06:08.681 --> 06:10.382
What do you need right now?

06:10.417 --> 06:12.050
Can I call my fiance?

06:12.085 --> 06:13.219
Do it this minute,
it's your last chance.

06:13.253 --> 06:14.653
I need her.

06:14.687 --> 06:16.222
She needs to make
a phone call!

06:16.256 --> 06:17.856
Go, go, go, go, go.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.391
You cannot ask her to do this.

06:19.426 --> 06:20.592
Okay, the show is going on,

06:20.626 --> 06:22.227
and it is going on tonight.

06:22.261 --> 06:23.661
We were worried she was green
when we were casting...

06:23.695 --> 06:25.597
And she has proven
herself since then.

06:25.631 --> 06:26.931
As a member of the chorus.

06:26.965 --> 06:28.032
She is my understudy

06:28.066 --> 06:29.534
and she is going on.

06:29.568 --> 06:31.102
What about the new song?

06:31.137 --> 06:34.139
We're gonna need that.

06:39.244 --> 06:41.211
- Dev.
- What happened?

06:41.246 --> 06:42.412
I'm going on as Marilyn.

06:42.447 --> 06:43.913
You're going on?

06:43.948 --> 06:44.948
I'm going on tonight.

06:44.982 --> 06:46.216
Tonight? That's, like...

06:46.251 --> 06:47.251
I know, but I gotta go.

06:47.285 --> 06:49.719
Karen, I am so proud of you.

06:49.754 --> 06:51.555
I love you so much.

06:51.589 --> 06:53.022
I love you too,
but get down here.

06:53.056 --> 06:54.023
- Get down here.
- Yeah.

06:54.057 --> 06:55.090
You have to come watch.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.359
Bye.

06:56.393 --> 06:59.928
I can't believe this.

06:59.963 --> 07:01.130
Shadow selves?

07:01.165 --> 07:04.167
Shadow selves to
the stage, please.

07:08.404 --> 07:09.804
The melody's done.

07:09.838 --> 07:10.972
If I start orchestrating now,

07:11.006 --> 07:12.974
I can have it finished by...

07:13.008 --> 07:17.712
3:00, which is tight,
but not unheard of.

07:17.746 --> 07:21.283
This is where I got
with the lyrics last night.

07:25.953 --> 07:27.120
It's good, I think.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.291
Maybe not so much, honey.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.927
Yeah, I know it sucks.

07:33.961 --> 07:35.128
We have so much time.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.567
We have so much time.

07:42.436 --> 07:45.104
Yes, it's a grand old
theater story.

07:45.138 --> 07:48.274
Movie star goes out
and the understudy goes in.

07:48.309 --> 07:50.443
It's gonna knock
everyone's socks off.

07:50.477 --> 07:51.611
Thanks.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.746
You can't let this happen.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.615
It's Ivy's part.

07:55.649 --> 07:58.417
Ivy is Marilyn.

07:58.451 --> 08:00.319
We've all seen it
a hundred times.

08:00.353 --> 08:01.954
She was fantastic
in that workshop.

08:01.988 --> 08:03.689
There was nothing wrong with
that workshop.

08:03.724 --> 08:04.690
She delivered.

08:04.725 --> 08:06.658
It's her part.

08:06.693 --> 08:08.961
Okay.

08:08.995 --> 08:11.797
What does that mean?
Okay?

08:11.832 --> 08:15.333
It means you don't get a vote
on this, Ellis.

08:15.367 --> 08:19.337
Why don't you do a Starbuck's
run for the creative team.

08:19.371 --> 08:22.540
It's gonna be a long day.

08:22.574 --> 08:25.309
You know, I didn't get
Rebecca Duvall out of your way

08:25.344 --> 08:28.012
so you could ignore me
yet again.

08:28.047 --> 08:30.180
You heard me.

08:30.215 --> 08:33.450
Rebecca Duvall, nice enough
person for a movie star,

08:33.484 --> 08:34.852
but she wasn't gonna
get us to Broadway,

08:34.885 --> 08:36.886
and none of you
would admit it.

08:36.921 --> 08:38.856
- What did you do?
- Everybody knows what I did.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.823
I put peanuts in the stupid
smoothie, okay?

08:40.859 --> 08:42.960
In a blender,
they grind right up.

08:42.994 --> 08:46.729
So don't ever call me an
assistant ever again.

08:46.764 --> 08:48.564
I am a producer.

08:48.598 --> 08:51.400
You are fired is what you are.

08:51.434 --> 08:54.536
Now get out of my
theater, Ellis!

08:54.571 --> 08:56.572
I'm not kidding.

09:00.510 --> 09:04.545
You haven't heard
the last of this.

Sorry.

09:37.612 --> 09:39.613
Michael, don't let
her run away.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.947
If she does that, grab her.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.016
- I mean that literally.
- Absolutely.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.851
Do we have anything
for her to wear

09:44.885 --> 09:46.720
that doesn't resemble
a sack of turnips?

09:46.754 --> 09:48.923
They didn't have time
to refit the costume.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.225
What a belt? There isn't
a belt in the building?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.294
- She's got a wrong lyric too.
- Okay.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.862
I do?

09:56.896 --> 09:58.531
There was a rewrite last week

09:58.565 --> 10:00.533
that didn't make it
into your script.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.067
Okay.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.302
- We switched the lines.
- Okay, let's reset.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.603
Take it from the top of
the chorus.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.538
There.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.139
Gods!

10:08.173 --> 10:10.908
Just a second.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.645
It's okay.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.681
What did you switch?

10:18.016 --> 10:19.551
I thought you needed me.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.386
That's why I came.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.321
I know.

10:23.355 --> 10:25.089
You don't have to run away.

10:25.123 --> 10:28.259
You don't have to
push me either.

10:28.293 --> 10:30.261
I'm not running away from you.

10:30.295 --> 10:33.331
I'm running away from myself.

10:33.365 --> 10:34.601
Yeah.

10:37.635 --> 10:38.634
Monica left me.

10:38.669 --> 10:42.806
I told her about us,
and she left me.

10:42.940 --> 10:43.940
Michael.

10:43.941 --> 10:47.941
She took Artie to her
parents in Seattle.

10:48.179 --> 10:51.948
Just-just give her some time.

10:51.983 --> 10:54.416
Yeah, time.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.218
He's three.

10:56.253 --> 10:58.890
Every day is like forever.

11:00.924 --> 11:02.925
Thank you.

11:06.162 --> 11:08.463
No.

11:08.498 --> 11:11.499
Okay, let's take it from
the top of the chorus.

11:17.742 --> 11:18.708
Frank.

11:18.742 --> 11:20.510
Wait.

11:20.544 --> 11:22.979
Frank, wait!

11:23.014 --> 11:24.547
We were just... it was not...

11:24.581 --> 11:26.082
Stop, Julia, stop.

11:26.117 --> 11:28.385
I know it wasn't anything.

11:28.419 --> 11:31.054
But I can't even see you
talking to him.

11:31.088 --> 11:33.490
I was just listening.

11:33.524 --> 11:36.025
And that means that
there's still a question

11:36.059 --> 11:37.726
for the rest of our lives.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.196
How can I...

11:41.231 --> 11:43.999
If that's still there?

11:46.017 --> 11:49.654
I wanna trust you,
but I can't do it.

11:51.856 --> 11:55.092
Other things
will be there too.

11:55.126 --> 11:56.528
Good things.

11:56.623 --> 11:59.226
That we created.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.528
Maybe that's all we can do.

12:03.863 --> 12:05.812
Just know that the good

12:06.113 --> 12:09.368
is more than the mistakes.

12:10.870 --> 12:12.504
I got us lunch.

12:12.538 --> 12:14.373
It's so greasy, mom,
you're gonna love it.

12:14.407 --> 12:17.342
Fish and chips in Boston,
how can you resist?

12:17.377 --> 12:18.844
You can't.

12:18.878 --> 12:20.044
I had them put vinegar on one
for you, dad.

12:20.079 --> 12:22.213
Thanks.

12:22.248 --> 12:25.349
How's the put-in
rehearsal going?

12:25.384 --> 12:28.185
Looked pretty good to me.

12:28.219 --> 12:31.221
It will be a lot better now
that you guys are here.

12:45.403 --> 12:47.103
One, two, three, four.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.972
Five, six, seven and one,
two, three, four.

12:50.007 --> 12:53.710
Five, six, seven and one, two,
three, four.

12:53.744 --> 12:58.547
Five, six, seven and one, two...

12:58.581 --> 12:59.981
Did we skip "Wolf"?

13:00.016 --> 13:02.150
She can't dance in
Rebecca's dress.

13:02.184 --> 13:03.906
This one she doesn't have to dance,

13:03.907 --> 13:05.186
just show her underwear.

13:07.590 --> 13:10.892
Derek, we need to put
the brakes on for a moment.

13:10.926 --> 13:12.993
Why? No new song yet?

13:13.028 --> 13:14.629
The song's almost done.

13:14.663 --> 13:18.098
- We're polishing lyrics.
- Well, go and finish it.

13:18.133 --> 13:21.135
Get ensemble in costumes for
"Wolf" please.

13:24.873 --> 13:28.608
He wouldn't even discuss it.

13:28.643 --> 13:30.310
I made a list
of songs Ivy knows.

13:30.344 --> 13:32.946
She already knows two thirds
of the show.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.851
So where were we?

13:37.928 --> 13:40.096
No Marilyn and no song.

13:41.130 --> 13:43.098
Something good.

13:43.132 --> 13:47.469
It's bigger than the bad.

13:48.504 --> 13:52.374
The good.

13:52.408 --> 13:55.410
It's bigger than the bad.

13:58.581 --> 14:02.416
That's something.

14:18.265 --> 14:21.501
Okay, hold.

14:21.535 --> 14:24.537
And where are we,
Ms. Cartwright?

14:25.772 --> 14:27.006
We are trying...

14:27.040 --> 14:29.309
Mr. Wills.

14:29.343 --> 14:32.344

as we're trying.

Derek?

17:35.817 --> 17:37.851
Why wasn't it me?

17:37.886 --> 17:39.320
Ivy, don't do this now.

17:39.354 --> 17:40.854
You know I could have done it.

17:40.889 --> 17:42.923
I know this show
as well as you do.

17:42.957 --> 17:45.859
I stayed up with you night after
night helping you with it.

17:45.894 --> 17:48.361
It doesn't make
any sense, Derek.

17:48.396 --> 17:50.097
If it was going to be a nobody,
why not me?

17:50.131 --> 17:53.200
I see her...

17:53.234 --> 17:56.103
In my head.

17:56.137 --> 18:02.308
I can't help it, I... see her.

18:02.342 --> 18:05.044
Look, she just has something...

18:05.078 --> 18:08.281
That you don't.

18:08.315 --> 18:10.316
I'm sorry.

18:19.358 --> 18:22.493
Yeah.

18:22.528 --> 18:25.797
I see.

18:25.832 --> 18:28.834
Thank you for being so honest.

18:36.174 --> 18:38.342
Ivy.

18:38.376 --> 18:41.345
- Yeah?
- Did you find the ring?

18:41.379 --> 18:45.716
- Ivy.
- No. I didn't.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.714
They really need to run
that costume change again.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.130
We might have to
simplify it a little.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.109
Just do it.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.311
Derek, we need to talk.

19:47.346 --> 19:48.813
We'll use the break
to figure it out.

19:48.848 --> 19:50.348
There are no breaks.

19:50.383 --> 19:51.716
Yes, Derek.

19:51.751 --> 19:53.216
We're all under
a lot of pressure,

19:53.251 --> 19:55.519
but according to equity,
there are still breaks.

19:55.553 --> 19:56.987
Okay, everyone,
let's take a ten,

19:57.021 --> 19:58.489
except for Ms. Cartwright

19:58.523 --> 20:01.157
who will practice
her costume change.

20:01.192 --> 20:04.495
- Derek?
- What?

20:04.529 --> 20:06.363
Admittedly,
that was thrilling,

20:06.398 --> 20:08.665
but it's the only number that
you got right all afternoon.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.400
Now she can't learn all
of this in one day.

20:10.434 --> 20:13.703
Okay, Don, there's way too
much movement up here.

20:13.737 --> 20:15.671
I'm gonna need you
to refocus VL6...

20:15.706 --> 20:17.807
Derek!

20:17.841 --> 20:20.010
I have had it up to here
with you blowing me off.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.379
Now I have seven million dollars
in this production

20:22.413 --> 20:24.814
and I want a conversation
right now!

20:24.848 --> 20:28.350
What do you suggest we do?

20:28.385 --> 20:30.986
She cannot do it.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.022
Get it?

20:43.765 --> 20:45.599
What is this...

20:45.634 --> 20:49.837
Ivy, did someone come in here
and put... who put this in here?

20:49.871 --> 20:54.175
I did.

20:54.209 --> 20:57.710
I just... honestly, I wasn't even
going to tell you,

20:57.745 --> 21:00.013
but when I realized he had asked
you to marry him...

21:00.048 --> 21:02.449
What are you doing with my
engagement ring, Ivy?

21:02.483 --> 21:05.118
He left it...

21:05.153 --> 21:07.187
In my room.

21:07.221 --> 21:11.091
Look, men are men,
and a traditional guy like Dev,

21:11.125 --> 21:13.859
bought you a ring, took you out
to dinner and asked you

21:13.893 --> 21:18.064
to marry him, it's very
Joe DiMaggio of him.

21:18.098 --> 21:20.366
Would you stop talking about
Marilyn, this is me.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.435
This is my life.

21:22.469 --> 21:23.735
That's why I'm telling you.

21:23.770 --> 21:26.805
So he slept with you? Is...

21:26.840 --> 21:29.140
No, you know what, I don't...

21:29.175 --> 21:30.808
I don't believe you.

21:30.843 --> 21:33.845
Why would I make this up?

21:50.195 --> 21:51.395
You're doing great.

21:51.429 --> 21:52.396
That last number,
it was terrific.

21:52.430 --> 21:55.232
What is this?

21:55.266 --> 21:59.436
- Where did you find that?
- Where do you think?

21:59.471 --> 22:02.305
What is Ivy doing
with my engagement ring?

22:02.339 --> 22:06.809
Dev?

22:06.843 --> 22:11.280
It must have fallen out of my
pocket when I was in her room.

22:11.315 --> 22:14.650
You slept with her?

22:14.684 --> 22:16.486
I thought we were finished.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.086
I was drunk.

22:18.121 --> 22:18.680
It was a mistake.

22:18.681 --> 22:20.422
A mistake? Is that what
they're calling it now?

22:20.456 --> 22:21.823
All this was tearing us apart.

22:21.857 --> 22:23.125
I thought I was losing you.

22:23.159 --> 22:24.159
Okay, so you just...

22:24.193 --> 22:25.494
We got through this.

22:25.528 --> 22:27.029
- Please, don't go back.
- Go back?

22:27.063 --> 22:28.430
- I don't even know...
- This is a struggle.

22:28.464 --> 22:29.498
Neither of us knew what
this was gonna be,

22:29.532 --> 22:30.698
but we are through it.

22:30.733 --> 22:32.034
I promise you.

22:32.068 --> 22:33.634
We are through
the worst of this.

22:33.668 --> 22:36.770
Karen, they need you onstage.

22:36.804 --> 22:38.472
I'm sorry,
we just need one minute.

22:38.507 --> 22:41.509
No, we don't.

22:45.747 --> 22:47.614
Karen, hi.

22:47.649 --> 22:50.450
We just want to
tell you how much

22:50.484 --> 22:52.718
we appreciate all
your hard work today.

22:52.753 --> 22:54.754
- And uh...
- Yes?

22:56.690 --> 22:59.225
Karen...

22:59.260 --> 23:02.295
We are going to look at the
costume change into <i>Wolf,</i>

23:02.329 --> 23:06.831
and then you and I are gonna
talk about act two, okay?

23:06.866 --> 23:08.467
Derek?

23:08.501 --> 23:11.170
Okay, just give me a second.

23:11.204 --> 23:13.305
Okay, you listen to me, okay?

23:13.339 --> 23:15.207
I hate collaborating,
all right?

23:15.241 --> 23:16.741
I hate it.

23:16.776 --> 23:18.343
I am an artist
and a storyteller

23:18.378 --> 23:21.546
and this is my vision and no one
is gonna get in my way.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.747
If you want a hit,
then be quiet!

23:23.782 --> 23:25.716
And I will give you
one and afterwards

23:25.750 --> 23:27.885
you can say "thank you."

23:27.919 --> 23:31.055
Karen, let's go.

23:31.090 --> 23:34.092
Wonderful.

23:41.966 --> 23:46.769
I heard you were
looking for me.

23:46.804 --> 23:50.340
Tell me why we do this again.

23:50.374 --> 23:54.343
You know. Art.

23:54.377 --> 23:56.078
Art?

23:56.113 --> 23:59.582
What... art is a sick compulsion.

23:59.616 --> 24:02.718
Art is an ego gone haywire.

24:02.752 --> 24:04.920
- Art...
- Art is beautiful.

24:04.954 --> 24:06.455
It brings you joy
to write a song.

24:06.490 --> 24:08.056
It brings us joy to sing it.

24:08.091 --> 24:12.760
It brings an audience joy
to hear it.

24:12.794 --> 24:15.796
Now get back to work.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.705
You're putting
the understudy in

24:25.740 --> 24:28.408
with an ending
that doesn't work?

24:28.443 --> 24:31.778
She's very good and the
ending's been fixed.

24:31.812 --> 24:32.879
How much are you into this?

24:32.913 --> 24:34.914
Seven, eight million?

24:34.949 --> 24:36.983
None of your business.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.453
Is Katie giving you money?

24:39.487 --> 24:42.321
I've chosen not to use our
daughter as a weapon, Jerry.

24:42.356 --> 24:45.057
Have you truly not
noticed that by now?

24:45.091 --> 24:48.594
I'm here to help.

24:48.629 --> 24:49.595
Sure you are.

24:49.630 --> 24:51.497
Why don't you let me?

24:51.532 --> 24:53.533
Go away.

24:56.637 --> 24:59.504
I bought a ticket.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.541
I'll see you tonight.

25:17.322 --> 25:18.355
What is that?

25:18.390 --> 25:20.191
It's the orchestration.

25:20.225 --> 25:21.625
No, no, no, no gospel.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.195
There's nothing gospel
about Marilyn.

25:24.229 --> 25:27.498
It has to be triumphant,
but she's just died.

25:27.532 --> 25:28.999
And gospel is triumphant.

25:29.033 --> 25:30.700
I hate it when
you get literal.

25:30.734 --> 25:33.503
You're the one who wanted to
end this in a suicide.

25:33.537 --> 25:34.870
Yes, I did and you said that
we couldn't.

25:34.905 --> 25:35.871
People didn't clap

25:35.906 --> 25:37.307
when she killed herself, Julia.

25:37.341 --> 25:38.675
Yeah, and they're not gonna
clap

25:38.709 --> 25:39.975
if she just ascends
into heaven either

25:40.010 --> 25:41.711
so knock it off with the gospel.

25:41.745 --> 25:44.013
We have a song,
we have no time.

25:44.047 --> 25:47.048
Please simple, simple, please.

26:00.029 --> 26:03.664
She can't do it, can she?

26:03.699 --> 26:06.701
I don't know.

26:14.443 --> 26:17.444
This is a disaster.

26:19.247 --> 26:22.249
It's such a good musical.

26:24.518 --> 26:27.520
And this is a disaster.

26:32.059 --> 26:35.827
I think I'm gonna be sick.

26:44.638 --> 26:46.538
Karen? Karen,
what are you doing?!

26:46.573 --> 26:48.540
Karen!

26:48.575 --> 26:51.409
For crying out loud,
what is the problem now?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.410
Karen!

26:52.444 --> 26:54.111
Where is Karen?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.681
She left.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.349
What do you mean "she left"?

26:58.384 --> 27:01.386
She left, Derek,
she just left.

27:09.827 --> 27:11.861
Are you okay?

27:11.896 --> 27:13.563
I threw up.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.265
- It's been a little stressful.
- Yeah.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.733
But still, I never throw up.

27:16.768 --> 27:17.967
I mean, I feel like it plenty,

27:18.002 --> 27:19.969
but I think the last
time I threw up

27:20.004 --> 27:25.574
I was...
I was pregnant with Leo.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.943
You guys.

27:27.977 --> 27:29.211
Have you seen Karen?

27:29.245 --> 27:32.214
Isn't she staging with Derek?

27:32.248 --> 27:35.250
Actually, she's missing.

27:39.362 --> 27:40.396
Lyle.

27:40.430 --> 27:42.431
I can't believe it, they
told me you were here.

27:42.465 --> 27:45.501
I came to check up on Marilyn

27:45.535 --> 27:48.537
and to give this back to you.

27:54.109 --> 27:56.944
Marilyn's in trouble, Lyle.

27:56.978 --> 27:58.246
She's gone missing.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.515
I did hear you lost your star.

28:00.549 --> 28:02.450
My assistant tried to poison
her with peanuts.

28:04.820 --> 28:07.121
In any case,
I can't take this.

28:07.155 --> 28:08.756
We're not out of the woods.

28:08.790 --> 28:10.390
I don't know what's
gonna happen tonight.

28:10.425 --> 28:12.025
Well whatever happened to that
gorgeous blond

28:12.059 --> 28:13.260
you had playing Marilyn before?

28:13.294 --> 28:17.931
As I recall,
she was spectacular.

28:17.965 --> 28:20.701
She really was.

28:20.735 --> 28:22.636
She took the wig off.

28:22.670 --> 28:24.804
In this production, that's
Paramount to "I quit."

28:24.839 --> 28:26.272
You think she's cracking?

28:26.306 --> 28:29.208
I think she has four hours
to learn act two

28:29.243 --> 28:31.410
including a brand new number
that no one's even seen yet

28:31.445 --> 28:33.613
and she bolted, so I'd say,
yeah, she's cracking.

28:33.647 --> 28:36.649
- I think something happened.
- Where's Karen Cartwright?

28:43.656 --> 28:45.590
I'll tell you one thing.

28:45.625 --> 28:48.126
Ivy wouldn't run.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.328
No, I wouldn't.

28:50.363 --> 28:54.932
Will you just... just
call me back?

28:54.967 --> 28:58.068
Has anybody seen Karen?

28:59.037 --> 29:01.406
- What are you doing here?
- It's none of your business.

29:01.416 --> 29:04.586
Actually, do you know what?
It is my business.

29:04.606 --> 29:07.374
Yeah, I don't really care what's
going on between you two,

29:07.514 --> 29:09.516
but you need to back off

29:09.517 --> 29:12.351
and let me get her through this.

29:12.386 --> 29:15.921
This is who she is.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.957
She's mine now.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.630
She's mine if I can find her.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.062
Go away.

29:59.096 --> 30:00.698
Well, darling...

30:02.732 --> 30:06.535
You dropped bits of Marilyn
along the way like bird crumbs.

30:06.569 --> 30:09.071
You have to be a bit
cleverer than that

30:09.105 --> 30:10.706
if you don't want to be found.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.842
I can't do it.

30:12.876 --> 30:14.076
We both know that's not true.

30:14.110 --> 30:15.978
I...

30:16.012 --> 30:18.512
I don't wanna do it.

30:18.547 --> 30:22.483
We both know that's
not true either.

30:22.517 --> 30:25.320
Okay.

30:25.354 --> 30:28.389
What happened?

30:28.423 --> 30:30.424
Does it matter?

30:30.459 --> 30:32.927
Actually, no, it doesn't.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.830
Art isn't therapy.

30:36.865 --> 30:41.368
We're not here to work out our
personal problems.

30:41.402 --> 30:42.936
We're here to take
those problems

30:42.971 --> 30:44.571
and completely exploit them.

30:44.605 --> 30:46.675
To hell with how much we hurt.

30:48.709 --> 30:50.176
Actually, the more you hurt,
the better.

30:50.210 --> 30:52.378
Knock it off, Derek.

30:52.412 --> 30:54.113
You think you can talk me
into going out there

30:54.147 --> 30:55.882
because that's what
you need me to do.

30:55.916 --> 30:56.883
- It's what the show needs.
- And I can't do it.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.017
Okay.

30:58.051 --> 31:01.254
My whole life is c...

31:01.288 --> 31:04.357
Is completely...

31:04.391 --> 31:07.392
And I can...

31:09.828 --> 31:13.831
You don't... understand because
you don't understand love.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.836
Doesn't matter if I don't.

31:20.439 --> 31:23.240
You do.

31:23.275 --> 31:25.109
Marilyn did.

31:25.143 --> 31:29.313
You've always had so much of her
at your fingertips.

31:31.917 --> 31:34.919
And now you have the heartbreak.

31:38.588 --> 31:39.989
Did you guys need me?

31:40.024 --> 31:42.158
We do.

31:42.192 --> 31:45.295
Well, this is a lot to ask
at the last minute,

31:45.329 --> 31:47.897
but if we have to cancel
another preview,

31:47.932 --> 31:49.565
who knows what they're gonna
write about us.

31:49.599 --> 31:51.167
Okay, we're running
out of time.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.136
Let's cut to the chase.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.137
Sorry.

31:55.171 --> 31:58.173
I was a little upset
about something.

32:05.848 --> 32:08.183
Ivy.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.017
It's okay.

32:10.052 --> 32:13.054
It's okay, you guys.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.867
I've had it enough
this diva's behaviour, Derek.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.493
Yeah, okay, lots to do.

32:19.527 --> 32:21.829
Okay, we're not gonna run the
costume change

32:21.863 --> 32:23.497
into <i>Wolf,</i> because we haven't
really got time, okay.

32:23.531 --> 32:24.698
Where's the new ending?

32:24.732 --> 32:26.466
Right, I'm gonna need Michael,

32:26.500 --> 32:29.502
Bobby, Jessica, please.
Where's Josh?

32:29.536 --> 32:31.171
New song, please,
where's the new song?

32:31.205 --> 32:32.272
The lyrics aren't even...

32:32.306 --> 32:33.539
Just finish them later.

32:33.574 --> 32:36.009
Where do you want me?

32:36.043 --> 32:38.211
Okay, come with
me darling, please.

32:38.245 --> 32:40.546
Okay?

32:40.581 --> 32:42.481
All right.

32:42.515 --> 32:44.850
Center stage, okay?

32:44.884 --> 32:49.421
Right, Don, give me
everything you've got please.

32:49.422 --> 32:50.555
All right.

32:50.590 --> 32:52.657
Okay, Jessica, right here.

32:52.692 --> 32:54.293
Posted center right.

32:54.327 --> 32:56.962
Bobby, Dennis right
up center here.

32:56.997 --> 32:59.297
You three drop down there.

32:59.331 --> 33:02.333
Viv, here please.

33:07.606 --> 33:08.739
There she is.

33:08.773 --> 33:09.874
Mom?

33:09.908 --> 33:11.142
What are you doing here?

33:11.176 --> 33:12.543
What do you mean?

33:12.577 --> 33:14.211
I came to see you.

33:14.245 --> 33:16.546
You drove all the way from
Connecticut?

33:16.580 --> 33:18.648
How could I miss it?

33:18.682 --> 33:23.153
You're going to play Marilyn.

33:23.187 --> 33:26.856
It's not me, mom.

33:26.891 --> 33:28.525
They didn't pick me.

33:28.559 --> 33:31.327
That's not possible.

33:31.361 --> 33:35.498
It's what happened.

33:35.532 --> 33:38.667
Ivy...

33:38.701 --> 33:41.370
I'm just in the chorus, mom.

33:41.405 --> 33:44.373
You should just go home.

33:59.484 --> 34:00.851
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:00.885 --> 34:01.953
- This is it.
- No, it's not.

34:01.987 --> 34:03.054
Yes, we don't need...

34:03.088 --> 34:05.389
Look. Look.

34:05.424 --> 34:08.092
Julia, look.

34:08.126 --> 34:09.860
Go.

34:09.893 --> 34:10.860
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.

34:10.895 --> 34:12.463
- Sorry.
- Pardon.

34:12.496 --> 34:13.596
Pardon me.
Sorry.

34:13.630 --> 34:14.597
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

34:14.630 --> 34:15.764
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

34:15.799 --> 34:17.233
- Program!
- Yes, thank you.

34:17.268 --> 34:18.534
Sorry. Coming through.

34:18.569 --> 34:20.971
- You all right?
- Yup.

34:21.005 --> 34:23.206
- Okay, excuse us.
- Sorry, so, so sorry.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.873
Go, go, go.

34:24.908 --> 34:27.444
This is your 15 minute call,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:27.478 --> 34:29.311
Your 15 minute call.

34:29.346 --> 34:30.980
15 minutes.

34:31.014 --> 34:32.147
Where's Marilyn?

34:32.181 --> 34:35.150
Make sure you get this to her.

34:35.185 --> 34:40.155
Break a leg.

34:40.190 --> 34:41.790
Break a leg.

34:41.824 --> 34:45.159
You're gonna be great.

34:45.194 --> 34:48.161
Places, please, places.

34:48.197 --> 34:49.330
Break a leg, sweetheart.

34:49.364 --> 34:53.167
You're gonna be wonderful.

34:53.202 --> 34:55.203
Break a leg.

35:10.351 --> 35:11.518
You're nothing.

35:11.552 --> 35:12.986
Your father left

35:13.021 --> 35:15.088
because he didn't want you.

35:15.123 --> 35:17.523
Your mother is crazy.

35:17.557 --> 35:19.958
Certifiably nuts.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.594
- Nobody wants you.
- Nobody wants you.

35:22.629 --> 35:25.631
- Nobody wants you.
- You're nothing.

37:05.659 --> 37:09.361
I just thought a little company
would be nice.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.696
We don't... have to do anything.

37:11.731 --> 37:15.367
Just... just talk.

37:15.401 --> 37:18.470
I like to talk.

37:18.505 --> 37:20.939
You know, people don't talk
enough or they talk too much.

37:20.973 --> 37:24.476
They're just...
They don't listen.

37:24.511 --> 37:28.513
I'm lying here, naked,
waiting for you.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.017
Come over.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.256
Come on.

37:39.824 --> 37:42.825
I'm more beautiful than ever.

37:45.796 --> 37:47.797
Sure.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.904
I understand.

37:54.938 --> 37:59.475
Just remember I...
