WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:06.223
- Angela Nelson, she was
married to Marcus West.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.964
- The addict who got killed
at County?

00:08.008 --> 00:09.400
- Jay still blames himself
for that.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.446
- So Jay went to see
Angela yesterday.

00:11.489 --> 00:12.795
- Hello?

00:13.926 --> 00:16.059
- We find her,
we find Jay.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.018
- Marcus didn't kill
those two kids.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.845
- What?
- I'm a cop, I arrested him.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.804
- You deserve to die.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.939
both:

00:26.983 --> 00:28.071
- You're safe.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.817
- 10-1.
10-1, officer down.

00:34.860 --> 00:38.560
- Jay, stay with me.
Stay with me, Jay.

00:38.603 --> 00:41.041
- His vitals are dropping.
He's losing too much blood.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.999
- Set up an Officer Down
detail to Med.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.609
Get those cars here now.

00:56.882 --> 00:59.407
- You got it, doc.
- Hang in there, Jay.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.105
- Hey, move it.
Clear out.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.672
Clear.
Come on.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.247
- Hold on.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.381
Let's move now.

01:17.425 --> 01:22.082
- Hey, hey.
I need this escort clean.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.953
You shut down every street
along the way.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.128
Go.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.785
This is 5021.
I need all available.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.700
Notify Med.

01:31.743 --> 01:34.311
We have a GSW
to the chest en route.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.183
He's one of our own.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.329
- Here you go.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.776
- Oh, excuse me.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.828
- Hey, everybody.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.352
I just talked to Dr. Marcel.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.485
He said the bullet
grazed an artery.

02:17.528 --> 02:20.270
They're still trying
to repair it.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.839
- Will?

02:23.882 --> 02:26.885
Is he gonna be okay?

02:31.063 --> 02:32.891
- He's lost a lot of blood.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.732
- I got an update
on Angela Nelson.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.386
- Okay.
- Doctors removed the bullet.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.128
She's gonna be fine.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.738
- Where is she?

02:58.830 --> 03:00.528
Angela Nelson.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.185
You're being charged
with the attempted murder

03:05.228 --> 03:09.014
of a Chicago police officer.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.191
- He got what he deserved.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.670
- What did you say?

03:12.714 --> 03:15.412
- It's karma for what he did.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.243
- I don't know much
about karma,

03:20.287 --> 03:22.245
but I do know
if Jay Halstead dies,

03:22.289 --> 03:23.986
you're gonna wish
you never lived.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.556
- You can't silence me.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.344
People are gonna know what
that cop did to my husband.

03:34.388 --> 03:37.434
This whole damn city's
gonna know.

03:43.005 --> 03:46.617
- She doesn't talk to anybody.
You understand?

03:46.661 --> 03:48.402
Nobody.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.753
- Nobody in or out,
including you.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.322
We need a plan to put someone
on the door we can trust.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.367
- Oh, my God.
- What?

03:57.411 --> 03:58.760
- Crawford.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.898
- Hank, I'm sorry to pull you
away from your man, Halstead.

04:06.942 --> 04:07.986
- Our man.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.379
- How's he doing?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.686
- He's still in surgery,
so we don't know, sir.

04:11.729 --> 04:14.210
- It's a hell of a thing.
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.256
- I feel terrible, and
obviously, I wouldn't pull you

04:16.299 --> 04:17.996
away unless it was important.
- Mm.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.349
- Okay, so evidence suggests
a home invasion.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.915
The whole house was tossed.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.830
Multiple offenders,
they were here for a while.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.093
We believe they took jewels
and valuables.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.791
But...

04:29.834 --> 04:34.317
The owner caught nine bullets
in his chest and torso.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.711
And he took them
from a freaking machine gun.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.192
- Well, it sounds like

04:40.236 --> 04:41.585
a straightforward
robbery-homicide.

04:41.629 --> 04:44.414
All due respect,
why did you call Intelligence?

04:44.458 --> 04:45.763
- Because of those casings.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.244
Now, those come from
an MK-18 assault rifle.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.593
Are you familiar?

04:49.637 --> 04:51.508
- I know you got to be
in the Army to have one.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.118
- That's right.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.338
And a military train was robbed
at the rail yard last month,

04:55.382 --> 04:57.471
and now we got 50 MK-18s
on the streets.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.864
We've already had
eight homicides on these guns.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.606
And this was gang on gang, but
now look where you're standing.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.392
This threat has moved
to the Gold Coast.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.742
- Oh, so you mean now
white people are dying.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.962
- No, Hank, these weapons pose
a threat to all civilians,

05:11.006 --> 05:13.530
black, white, and brown.

05:13.574 --> 05:16.403
And look,
I need some heavy hands

05:16.446 --> 05:19.971
to find out who is moving these
guns before more bodies drop.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.408
Okay?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.762
- Okay.
Any witnesses?

05:27.805 --> 05:29.285
- Yeah, a neighbor saw
two offenders

05:29.329 --> 05:31.374
sneaking out the back.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.333
The scene is fresh.
It's all yours.

05:33.376 --> 05:36.292
- Superintendent?
Anybody notify the wife?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.555
- We've been calling, have not
been able to get ahold of her.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.470
- Okay.
Forced entry?

05:40.514 --> 05:42.298
- No, alarm company
registered entry

05:42.342 --> 05:45.345
through the garage, which is...

05:45.388 --> 05:47.303
- You two gentlemen?
You're with me.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.522
- Copy that.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.833
- So the murder weapon used
in the home invasion

05:55.877 --> 05:57.269
was an MK-18.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.010
Soldiers call it
the street sweeper.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.403
It's fully automatic.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.014
It can rake an entire city
block in about 30 seconds.

06:03.058 --> 06:07.149
ATF, they ran into a dead end
on the train robbery.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.585
Their working theory is that

06:08.629 --> 06:11.240
a high ranking gang member's
the one selling the guns.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.547
- Anything on the victim?
- Yeah.

06:13.590 --> 06:17.072
Kirby Reed.
Successful investment banker.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.030
His wife had no idea
who would do this.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.511
She said they stole
jewels, cash,

06:21.555 --> 06:23.513
and a vintage collection
of Rolex watches.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.515
- Yeah, a neighbor saw
two African Americans

06:25.559 --> 06:27.865
run toward a blue car,
possibly a Nissan.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.824
So they were for sure
not from the neighborhood.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.129
- All right.

06:31.173 --> 06:34.698
Kev, talk to Robbery
about home invasion crews.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.700
You two, get an alert
to pawn shops,

06:36.744 --> 06:39.137
anyone moving
vintage Rolex watches.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.706
Vanessa, cast a wider net
on that blue Nissan.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.969
- Hey, Kim.
Kim, Kim, hey.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.841
Last night, your message,
you said it was important.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.538
What's going on?
- Yeah, let's talk tonight.

06:48.582 --> 06:49.757
- No, no, no.
Come on, you know me.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.498
It'll torture me all day.
Just talk to me.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.762
Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.852
- Did you make a decision
or something?

06:57.895 --> 07:00.507
- Yes.
I'm having the baby.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.251
- Hey.
We got some photos from CPIC.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.644
- We should go.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.964
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.444
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.749
- Yeah?

07:25.793 --> 07:27.403
I got you some gyro
from Greek Islands.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.884
I thought you might be hungry.
- That's really sweet of you.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.407
Thanks.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.278
- And I got you some clean
clothes from the apartment.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.585
- Thank you.

07:35.629 --> 07:38.240
- Have we heard anything
about Jay?

07:38.283 --> 07:39.676
- No.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.160
He's gonna freak out
when he wakes up.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.553
The man hates needles.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.949
I can't figure him out.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.038
He's the first one
through the door,

07:54.082 --> 07:55.779
a war vet.

07:55.823 --> 07:58.129
And he'd rather take a bullet
than get the flu shot.

08:02.569 --> 08:06.442
- Hailey, I know how hard
this must be for you.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.750
- It's always hard when
something like this happens.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.665
- It's hard because
you love him.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.672
- Of course I love him.
He's my partner.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.290
- Ruzek got a lead
on the home invasion.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.771
- Yeah, uh, I'm gonna stay.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.164
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks.

08:42.043 --> 08:45.002
- All right, so CPIC conducted
a security camera grid

08:45.046 --> 08:47.352
within a one mile radius
of the home invasion.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.137
They ID'd the getaway vehicle.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.269
It's a blue Nissan
registered to Kristy Pierce.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.576
Kristy works at this bar
over here, Mr. D's.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.796
Just spotted the Nissan parked
in the back lot.

08:55.839 --> 08:58.538
- Kristy's got a minor
rap sheet, all gang related.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.322
According to Robbery-Burglary,

09:00.365 --> 09:02.280
this joint is a hustler's
paradise for stolen jewels.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.761
But specifically,
Rolex watches.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.372
- I think we can wait
on picking up Kristy.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.984
Let's find out how many players
are involved first.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.203
Kev, you and Rojas
go undercover.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.118
Shop for Rolexes.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.903
Hey, just remember,

09:15.946 --> 09:19.471
people we're dealing with
got MK-18 assault rifles.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.386
You get a bad beat,
you abort.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.084
Are we clear?

09:23.127 --> 09:25.173
- Copy.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.130
You good?

09:26.174 --> 09:27.175
- Yeah.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.795
Guy at the bar.
Black jacket.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.319
There's a man
who knows his ice.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.495
- Yeah, and he don't hide it.

09:43.539 --> 09:44.845
- What can I get for you guys?

09:44.888 --> 09:46.673
- We're thinking about
two Hennessys on the rocks

09:46.716 --> 09:47.674
if that's okay.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.501
- And his jeweler's name.

09:49.545 --> 09:52.722
I mean, that watch would look
way better on my man.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.245
You help me out?

09:54.289 --> 09:55.638
- I can get the Hennessy,

09:55.682 --> 09:57.248
but as far as the watches,
you're on your own.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.511
It's not my business.
- We understand that.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.078
Two limes
for the Hennessys, please.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.080
- All right.
- Thank you.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.648
- 'Sup, baby?
- You know not to call me baby.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.998
- Hey, why you gotta
be like that?

10:08.042 --> 10:09.739
- Come on, Trey.
I'm try--

10:09.783 --> 10:11.088
Hey.
- Yo, come on.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.960
- I'm trying to go
make these drinks.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.831
Can you let go of me?
- Why are you making a scene?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.180
- Why are you holding me?

10:16.224 --> 10:18.182
- Relax, it doesn't
have to be like that.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.270
- Hey, get off.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.664
- Stay off it, punk!

10:23.971 --> 10:25.581
- Hey!
- Stop!

10:25.625 --> 10:26.669
both: Break it up,
break it up!

10:28.715 --> 10:29.716
- Chill!

10:29.759 --> 10:31.979
I'm telling you, careful.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.114
- Hey, I got this one.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.376
- Get off me, man.
Get off me.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.030
- What the hell
are you doing here?

10:40.074 --> 10:41.641
- I be asking you
the same thing, man.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.859
- Who is this kid?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.255
- He's my brother.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.219
- Jordan, the hell are you
doing in Chicago?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.699
You're supposed to be
on a road trip to Houston.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.440
- I'm visiting friends.
- Nobody told me.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.007
- I knew you wouldn't approve.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.096
- Because you're not safe here
to be in the city, Jordan.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.401
We're calling Auntie right now.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.751
Your ass is going
back to Texas--

11:04.794 --> 11:06.274
- No, no, no, no.
I'm not.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.233
You were the one who always
told me to create my own lane.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.148
Stand ten toes down, right?

11:11.192 --> 11:12.541
That's exactly what I'm doing.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.890
- We can't talk
about this here.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.457
- There ain't even nothing
to talk about.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.067
Man, I'm going back
to see my friends.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.548
- Nah, you don't got
no damn friends in there.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.115
I'm working, Jordan,

11:21.158 --> 11:22.856
which means ain't nothing
going on in there but trouble.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.248
Is that what you're
in town for?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.513
- No,

11:28.557 --> 11:29.819
Officer.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.519
- Yeah.

11:34.563 --> 11:38.523
It's time to go, okay?
Get out of here.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.699
Go.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.615
- Hey.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.530
Voight wants us
to pick up Kristy

11:45.574 --> 11:47.315
and head back
to the District.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.495
- Like I already said,

11:53.538 --> 11:55.540
I don't want to press charges
against anybody,

11:55.584 --> 11:56.977
so can I just go?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.762
- Look, we don't care
about that bar fight either.

11:59.806 --> 12:04.811
You're here 'cause your car was
used in a home invasion robbery

12:04.854 --> 12:07.291
in the Gold Coast yesterday.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.815
The owner was murdered.

12:08.858 --> 12:11.731
- Whoa, hold on.
I-I never go to Gold Coast.

12:11.774 --> 12:12.862
- Oh, yeah?

12:12.906 --> 12:15.822
Your blue Nissan was
the getaway vehicle.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.998
- Nah, it can't be true.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.173
- Kristy.

12:21.218 --> 12:24.482
You're looking at
felony murder, you understand?

12:27.268 --> 12:29.139
- Look, I can tell
by your priors

12:29.183 --> 12:31.141
you've been riding
with gangs.

12:31.185 --> 12:34.101
So you probably think
there's loyalty,

12:34.144 --> 12:36.625
but that's only for the boys.

12:36.668 --> 12:40.803
First sign of trouble, they
throw the girls under the bus.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.241
MOB, "money over bitches."

12:44.285 --> 12:46.113
Now do you really want
to take the fall

12:46.156 --> 12:48.071
for one of these bastards?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.819
- I loaned the car
to my cousin.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.865
- Okay, who's your cousin?

12:58.908 --> 13:01.432
- Mitchell Adams.
- Good.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.130
Were you with him yesterday?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.219
- No, I was
at my sister's all day.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.003
It's the honest to God truth,
so can I go?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.616
Yeah, if your alibi checks out.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.662
Until then,
you're staying in lockup.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.580
- One more thing.

13:18.623 --> 13:22.149
Why was Trey Woodson
hassling you at the bar?

13:22.192 --> 13:23.933
- He's my ex-boyfriend.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.806
He just hasn't accepted
the fact that it's over.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.122
- When were you gonna
tell me about Jordan?

13:39.166 --> 13:41.385
- First time I've seen
my brother in a year, Sergeant.

13:41.429 --> 13:44.127
He's fighting gang bangers
from Englewood.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.955
I'm still processing
the situation.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.305
I wasn't even thinking.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.612
- All right.
I get that.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.657
- It's still not safe
for him here.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.269
And if it gets out--
- It won't.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.706
Okay?

13:57.749 --> 14:00.578
Listen, he testified in front
of a secret grand jury.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.973
The killer he testified against
is being held in a cell

14:04.017 --> 14:06.976
23 hours a day, no contact
with the outside world.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.022
I made sure of that.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.545
There's practically nobody left
out on the streets

14:10.588 --> 14:11.763
who even knows what he did.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.722
- Sarge, it only takes
one person.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.988
- Kev, you're a lot older
than Jordan.

14:19.032 --> 14:22.862
You've always been more
like a father than a brother.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.428
Sooner or later,

14:24.472 --> 14:26.866
the son breaks from the father
to make his own mark.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.131
- I just wish
it wasn't this soon.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.002
- Mm-hmm.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.612
You don't get to choose.

14:34.656 --> 14:38.138
- Sarge?
We got something.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.400
- Come on.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.884
- I spoke to the crime lab.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.713
Kristy's car tested positive
for gunshot residue.

14:48.757 --> 14:52.543
It's got her prints
and her cousin's.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.764
Meet Mitchell Adams.
Nice long rap sheet.

14:55.807 --> 14:59.202
Just did a two year stint
for aggravated robbery.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.335
- And we're sure Kristy's
not involved too?

15:01.378 --> 15:03.728
- Yeah, her alibi is solid.
I got three witnesses that put

15:03.772 --> 15:05.992
her at her sister's house at
the time of the home invasion.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.559
- Okay, we got an address
on this Mitchell Adams?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.300
- Nothing since he got
out of Stateville.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.433
- Then we pull out
all the stops.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.609
I want to know where this
prick, Mitchell, is staying.

15:14.652 --> 15:18.178
- I've got news about Jay.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.614
- How are you feeling?

15:19.657 --> 15:22.095
- Like I was asleep for a year.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.880
- You needed a little rest.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.187
- Hailey?

15:27.230 --> 15:29.711
You know I hate hospitals.
- I do.

15:29.754 --> 15:30.973
- You got to get me
out of here.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.235
- It's not optional, no.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.282
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.070
- How's the shoulder?

15:41.114 --> 15:44.291
- It feels like I'll be flying
a little crooked for a while.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.683
- I went and talked to Will,

15:45.727 --> 15:49.252
and he said no structural
damage, so you got lucky.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.993
- I guess you
could call it that.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.389
How's Angela doing?

15:55.432 --> 15:56.781
- She's under arrest.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.309
- Sarge, is there anything
we can do for her?

16:04.354 --> 16:06.878
- Jay, she tried to kill you.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.490
Okay, she's getting charged.
Full freight.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.495
- She knows the truth.

16:14.538 --> 16:18.020
And what happened to Marcus,
that's on us.

16:20.196 --> 16:23.330
- I'm sorry, we need to run
some tests on our patient.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.117
- Just worry about getting
better, that's all, okay?

16:30.076 --> 16:31.686
Hailey?
- Yeah.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.129
- What do you think?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.826
- I think Jay's right.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.220
This Angela thing's
a ticking time bomb.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.179
We need to take care of it.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.484
That was Burgess.

16:47.528 --> 16:50.661
They got an address
on the home invasion crew.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.446
- Look, you run point on that,
I'm gonna put an end

16:52.489 --> 16:53.882
to this thing.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.978
- I asked for a lawyer.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.241
- I heard that.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.982
- I have the right
to tell my story.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.637
- You do.

17:09.680 --> 17:14.076
You should understand that
if you exercise that right,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.295
you're gonna be charged

17:15.338 --> 17:18.689
with attempted murder
of a police officer.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.214
And acting as an accomplice
in a drug rip

17:21.257 --> 17:22.911
where someone got killed.

17:22.954 --> 17:27.568
That means you'll be looking
at your son through prison bars

17:27.611 --> 17:31.180
for the next 20 years.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.313
You gotta ask yourself...

17:35.489 --> 17:38.231
- How bad do you want
to be right?

17:41.886 --> 17:45.107
- You took my husband
away from me.

17:45.151 --> 17:50.025
He wasn't perfect,
but he was trying his best.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.463
And now my son
doesn't have a father.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.863
- That's why he needs
his mother.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.956
- I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.917
- Here's what.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.183
Understand...

18:17.226 --> 18:18.923
It's a one-time offer.

18:21.970 --> 18:27.106
You decide to tell your story
some time down the line,

18:27.149 --> 18:29.499
I'll find you
and I'll bury you.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.129
- Yes?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.173
- Hi,
I'm with Catholic Charities.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.218
- Mm-hmm?

18:52.261 --> 18:54.045
- I need you to do
exactly as I say.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.662
Everyone,
I'm with Chicago Police.

19:01.705 --> 19:02.967
I need you to get
under the table now.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.534
I know you're scared.
Let's do this calmly

19:04.578 --> 19:06.232
and quickly, all right?
Let's go.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.289
- Chicago PD.
Let me see those hands.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.638
I'm good, I'm good.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.074
- You're clear, you're clear,
you're clear.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.815
- Turn around, Mitchell,
put your hands on the wall.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.513
I'm good over here.
- All right, let's move.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.299
Gun!

19:37.698 --> 19:39.700
- A fighter down.
You guys okay?

19:39.743 --> 19:42.137
both: Yeah.
- Kim, call out.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.009
Are you okay?

19:45.053 --> 19:46.620
Call out.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.760
Yeah, I'm good.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.675
We're all good.

20:07.510 --> 20:11.166
- We recovered the
stolen Rolexes at your place,

20:11.210 --> 20:13.951
along with the weapon used
to commit the murder.

20:13.995 --> 20:17.172
But honestly, Mitchell,
I can't figure out

20:17.216 --> 20:19.957
how you could have made this
any easier for us.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.307
I mean, you got
any other colors

20:21.350 --> 20:23.178
you want to add
to this picture?

20:25.746 --> 20:27.138
- It was an accident.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.053
An accident?

20:29.097 --> 20:31.447
You accidentally shot
Kirby Reed nine times.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.407
- I didn't shoot him.
My associate did.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.845
- The associate
that died at the duplex?

20:37.888 --> 20:39.673
- Yeah.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.240
- Right.

20:44.808 --> 20:49.509
- Look, dude came home
while we were in the house.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.076
We were just gonna
put him in the closet,

20:52.120 --> 20:54.644
but he tried to be a hero.
- Okay.

20:54.688 --> 20:58.474
- He grabbed the gun, and...
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

20:58.518 --> 21:01.477
That thing just exploded.
- Hmm.

21:01.521 --> 21:04.306
All right, look, Mitchell.

21:04.350 --> 21:08.528
There's a man dead, and there's
no way to make that right.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.269
No way.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.880
There is still
one good thing you can do.

21:14.490 --> 21:17.537
Now, where'd you get the MK-18?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.758
- What's in it for me?

21:25.414 --> 21:26.937
- You give us
who sold you the gun,

21:26.981 --> 21:28.417
and I'll see what I can do.

21:36.425 --> 21:39.123
- I want it in writing.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.343
- Mitchell said
he bought the MK-18s

21:41.387 --> 21:45.260
from this guy right here.
Trey Woodson, 22 years old.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.957
- He's the cat that got into it
with my brother.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.394
- One and the same.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.221
And he's got
a history of violence.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.093
Grand theft auto,
assault with a deadly weapon.

21:52.136 --> 21:55.357
He cut off the nose of a rival
banger with a straight razor.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.141
Spent four years in Juvie,
got out,

21:57.185 --> 21:58.578
and he's been clean ever since.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.406
- Yeah, now Woodson
has a store in Englewood

22:00.449 --> 22:02.233
with his own clothing line,
"Trey Lit."

22:02.277 --> 22:03.757
- Okay.

22:03.800 --> 22:08.065
- His landlord also happens
to be his business partner,

22:08.109 --> 22:09.850
Darius Walker.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.418
- Trey Woodson.
I knew I knew that name.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.028
When I was undercover
on Darius Walker,

22:14.071 --> 22:15.377
that name came up a lot.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.379
- Yeah, well, if Darius is
that close with Trey,

22:17.423 --> 22:19.599
then Darius knows
Trey's dealing guns.

22:19.642 --> 22:22.210
- Hey, Kevin,
your brother's downstairs.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.568
- What are you
doing here, Jordan?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.178
- I'm waiting for Kristy
to be released.

22:34.222 --> 22:35.702
- The hell you waiting
on her for?

22:35.745 --> 22:38.313
Look, she's my girl, bro.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.186
That's why you came back.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.667
- Nah, that's not
the only reason, but yeah.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.755
I wanted to see her.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.149
- You know Trey Woodson
is her ex?

22:48.192 --> 22:49.672
- I know that.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.066
- Which means that she's
a part of that world.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.199
'Cause he's a problem,
which makes her a problem.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.853
- Look, I can handle it,
all right?

22:56.897 --> 22:58.333
- What can you handle?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.379
And why would you even put
yourself in that position?

23:00.422 --> 23:02.206
- Listen, I didn't come here
for advice, all right?

23:02.250 --> 23:03.425
- Jordan?

23:06.907 --> 23:09.475
- Come on.
Let's go.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.660
- Sergeant Voight.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.491
You always choose exotic,
new places for us to meet.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.015
It's almost like we're dating.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.366
- Yeah, well, we're
in a relationship, all right.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.457
Given the information
I got, though,

23:35.501 --> 23:37.459
I think it might
be coming to an end.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.374
- I wish I could say
I was heartbroken.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.681
- Yeah, you will be.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.160
You know, I look
the other way

23:43.204 --> 23:44.814
for a lot
of your drug activity.

23:44.858 --> 23:48.383
That's the price
of the information you provide.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.864
But guns are a red line,
Darius, and you crossed it.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.692
- I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.434
- There's MK-18s being sold
on the streets,

23:55.477 --> 23:57.871
military assault rifles.
- Yeah, I heard

23:57.914 --> 24:00.221
about those guns, but I
don't know who's running them.

24:00.264 --> 24:04.007
- I got a witness who's willing
to testify he bought an MK-18

24:04.051 --> 24:06.575
from Trey Woodson,
who works directly under you.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.447
- Get out of here.
Who is your witness?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.144
- He's credible.
- He's wrong.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.494
- Mm-hmm.
- Trey is an artist.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.454
And he's legit, and he would
never go behind my back.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.674
- Darius, you may
want to believe that,

24:18.718 --> 24:21.416
but I got a witness
who says otherwise.

24:28.771 --> 24:32.558
- I'll look into it.
- Damn right, you will.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.037
- You got a witness.

24:42.132 --> 24:45.309
- All right, we got
Trey Woodson in pocket.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.355
Black SUV, plates match.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.754
- What's up, Darius, I didn't
know you was coming through.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.016
- What's up, Black?

24:56.059 --> 24:57.626
- Good to see you, man.
- You too, man.

24:57.670 --> 24:58.932
- Yeah.

24:58.975 --> 25:01.064
- You know what, man,
you're like a son to me.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.588
And I always

25:02.631 --> 25:05.460
support
your artistic endeavors.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.375
- Mm-hmm, that you do.
I'm grateful.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.899
- And in return
for that support,

25:09.943 --> 25:12.467
you stay out of the game.
That's the understanding

25:12.511 --> 25:14.643
we had, right?
- 100%, yeah.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.951
- So why am I hearing that
you're selling military assault

25:17.994 --> 25:20.475
rifles in my neighborhood?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.086
Behind my back?

25:23.130 --> 25:24.740
- Now, who told you that?

25:26.176 --> 25:27.961
You know what?
People just gossiping.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.529
Everybody jealous
of what I got going on.

25:31.747 --> 25:32.661
- Yo.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.535
Trey.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.930
We always talk about...

25:40.974 --> 25:43.542
Accountability, right?

25:47.067 --> 25:49.417
You're selling guns?

25:51.288 --> 25:52.420
- Yeah.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.380
Yeah, I am.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.428
I'm sorry, man.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.696
Look, Darius,

26:07.740 --> 26:09.872
I'm just trying to diversify
like you taught me.

26:09.916 --> 26:13.006
You're the person that said
I got to create my own lane.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.704
I got to learn to stand
on my own two feet.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.663
I got to be strong, right?

26:17.706 --> 26:20.491
It's no way this thing
is coming back to you or me.

26:20.535 --> 26:23.190
- Then why are we having
this conversation?

26:23.233 --> 26:24.713
Hmm?

26:27.890 --> 26:30.893
- I just needed a little bit
of cash to market my brand.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.766
- Come on, Darius.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.768
Get him to say
where the guns are.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.074
- Look, man,
I ain't mean no disrespect.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.035
- Hey.

26:42.078 --> 26:45.386
You just did
what you thought you had to.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.997
- Damn right.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.999
So what's up?
We good?

26:53.133 --> 26:57.790
- Yeah.
Yeah, we're all good, all good.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.583
- What's the matter with you?
Why'd you cut it off?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.367
- I did what you asked.
You got what you needed.

27:10.411 --> 27:11.586
- No, no, no,
no, no, no.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.196
You were supposed
to get Trey

27:13.240 --> 27:14.633
to tell us where the guns are.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.112
- I know what I was
supposed to do.

27:20.943 --> 27:25.469
All the young men want
to make it on the streets.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.516
And the streets are gonna
kill them all.

27:28.559 --> 27:32.781
- Darius, I understand
how you feel about Trey.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.830
He's selling those guns.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.702
You got to set up that buy.

27:45.272 --> 27:47.927
- I will not be there
when you bury him.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.765
- All right, there's no sign
of this Trey Woodson.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.157
You said the meet was at 6:00.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.811
It's almost 7:00.
We sure this is happening?

28:04.508 --> 28:08.643
- Darius confirmed the meet
with Trey, so we wait.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.297
- All right.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.175
- Beige pickup coming your way.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.094
- Yeah, we got eyes.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.363
- All right, nobody moves
until we see the guns.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.843
On my order.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.859
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.645
Where's Trey?

28:54.689 --> 28:56.125
- You got the money?

28:56.169 --> 28:57.605
- We don't know you.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.520
- Trey wanted me
to make sure you're legit.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.045
- Yeah, we're legit, all right.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.971
50K.
It's all there.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.930
You got something for us?

29:17.973 --> 29:20.106
- Whoa, hey.
- Cell phone.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.249
He's not answering.

29:33.293 --> 29:36.905
- All right, well,
maybe you just take us to him.

29:36.949 --> 29:39.386
- Nah, it don't work like that.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.170
- You're just gonna
walk away from 50K?

29:41.214 --> 29:43.607
- Nah, I'ma drive.

29:52.616 --> 29:55.489
- Boss, what do you want to do?
Do you want to take this guy?

29:55.532 --> 29:56.620
It's your call.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.496
- Take his ass now.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.726
- Show me your damn hands!

30:17.119 --> 30:18.991
Cover me, Rojas!

30:19.034 --> 30:20.862
Get over here!

30:20.906 --> 30:22.603
- Got his gun?

30:22.646 --> 30:24.431
- Yeah, we're good.
- You broke my damn arm!

30:24.474 --> 30:25.998
- Yeah, we're just
getting started, buddy.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.173
- Stand down,
stand down, stand down.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.915
I got him.
Come on, get your ass up.

30:29.958 --> 30:32.265
- Get up!

30:32.308 --> 30:35.746
- Hey, listen to me.

30:35.790 --> 30:38.097
You got five seconds
to tell me where Trey is.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.838
- Ain't telling you
nothing, man.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.056
You ain't got nothing
on me, man.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.362
- Didn't he ask you something?

30:42.405 --> 30:43.929
All right.

30:43.972 --> 30:45.669
- Huh?
- All right, all right.

30:45.713 --> 30:49.891
He keeps a crib above
his warehouse over on Racine.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.884
- Chicago PD.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.059
Body.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.977
Ruze, how we looking?

31:32.020 --> 31:33.674
- Clear.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.636
- Sarge, we got a body.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.160
It's Trey Woodson.

31:44.728 --> 31:47.688
- Patrol responded to a shots
fired call on this block

31:47.731 --> 31:49.951
earlier in the afternoon,
but they came up empty.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.170
- All right,
canvass for witnesses

31:51.213 --> 31:53.955
and check for surveillance.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.392
- There's 45 rifles here.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.307
- All right, notify ATF.
Let's get them back

31:58.351 --> 32:00.831
to the military.
- Copy.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.836
- I know what I'm feeling
ain't right.

32:07.795 --> 32:10.363
Part of me is relieved.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.887
- I get it, Kev.
- Burgess?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.497
- Collin, over here.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.716
I want the whole room
printed, okay?

32:15.759 --> 32:17.065
- Got it.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.548
- Kev?
- Yeah?

32:28.468 --> 32:30.731
- I talked
to a patrol officer downstairs.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.429
They pulled security footage
from across the alley.

32:33.473 --> 32:36.998
We got a clear view
of the shooter.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.913
It ain't good.

32:43.265 --> 32:45.267
That's 4:20 this afternoon.

32:49.141 --> 32:52.405
You can see the gun
clear as day, man.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.980
Kev, you know I got your back.
How do you want to play this?

33:02.023 --> 33:03.372
You just tell me.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.205
- I don't know.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.871
- What the hell
are you doing here?

33:23.914 --> 33:25.699
- Me and you outside,
right now.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.838
What happened?
- What are you talking about?

33:34.882 --> 33:36.666
- Don't play with me, Jordan.
I don't got time for it.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.841
What the hell happened?

33:37.885 --> 33:39.452
- I don't know
what you want from me, man.

33:39.495 --> 33:40.844
- Trey Woodson
got shot to death,

33:40.888 --> 33:42.498
and you got caught
on surveillance cameras

33:42.542 --> 33:45.284
leaving his warehouse
with a gun in your hand.

33:47.416 --> 33:50.419
- Listen.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.594
I didn't shoot him.

33:51.638 --> 33:52.813
- The gun was in
your hand, Jordan.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.423
- Look, I was trying
to get rid of the gun.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.643
I didn't shoot him.
- Then who shot him?

33:56.686 --> 33:58.819
- No, no, no.
- Jordan.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.473
- No, no, no, no.
- Jordan, look at me.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.650
- No...
- Jordan.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.044
Was it Kristy?
- Yeah.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.960
Look, I don't know
what happened.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.571
But she needed me.

34:11.614 --> 34:14.661
The gun was in the apartment,
and I went up there,

34:14.704 --> 34:16.184
and I cleaned the place up.

34:16.228 --> 34:19.013
I wiped everything down,
I cleaned all the fingerprints.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.146
I even went out back
so nobody could see me.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.235
- Well, that was the only place
there was a camera, dumbass.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.240
- So what did you do
with the gun?

34:28.283 --> 34:30.068
- I threw it in the river.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.159
I didn't know what else
to do with it, man.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.770
- Okay.

34:36.813 --> 34:41.035
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.776
Listen to me.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.866
Listen to me.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.957
You are gonna go home.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.872
You're gonna stay
the hell away from her,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.700
and you're gonna keep
your mouth shut, okay?

34:53.743 --> 34:55.310
- No, no, no, no.
I can't walk away from her.

34:55.354 --> 34:57.138
- Boy!

34:57.182 --> 35:00.446
Stay the hell away from Kristy,
and keep your damn mouth shut.

35:02.578 --> 35:06.191
Do you understand me?

35:06.234 --> 35:07.670
- Okay, okay.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.197
Okay.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.720
- Go.

35:25.949 --> 35:29.214
- All right, Kevin, did Jordan
give you any other details?

35:29.257 --> 35:31.216
What her motives
might have been?

35:31.259 --> 35:33.131
- No.

35:33.174 --> 35:36.221
All he told me was that
Kristy killed Trey.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.440
And he got rid of the gun.

35:40.921 --> 35:43.924
- Well, the good news is we
still got control of this case.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.448
So we still got a chance
to tie things off, but...

35:48.146 --> 35:51.801
We gotta move fast before
Homicide starts sniffing.

35:51.845 --> 35:52.846
'Cause that happens--

35:52.889 --> 35:55.414
- He's not going down
for murder.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.024
- Mm-hmm.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.550
Well...

36:08.296 --> 36:11.081
Then our best play is
to get her to confess.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.437
- You're wrong.
I did not kill Trey Woodson.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.831
- Kristy, we got your prints
all over his apartment.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.616
- That's because
we used to date.

36:23.659 --> 36:26.836
- Uh-huh.
- I already told you.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.230
- We contacted your cousin,
and Mitchell Adams told us

36:29.274 --> 36:30.971
that you were supposed
to get a thousand dollars

36:31.014 --> 36:34.496
for letting him use your car.
Is that right?

36:34.540 --> 36:36.759
- So you went to Trey's house
looking for money,

36:36.803 --> 36:39.240
he didn't want to give it
to you, and you shot him.

36:45.507 --> 36:46.682
- I ain't gonna
lie to you, Kristy.

36:46.726 --> 36:47.988
We know everything.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.124
Everything.

36:54.168 --> 36:58.477
We got a cooperating witness.
- What?

36:58.520 --> 37:00.305
- He ain't stupid.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.697
- Jordan?

37:03.960 --> 37:05.658
He's ratting me out,
that's what you're saying?

37:05.701 --> 37:07.137
- What I'm saying is,
it's obvious

37:07.181 --> 37:09.662
that you've been playing him
like a punk this whole time.

37:09.705 --> 37:10.967
You're still hooking up
with Trey.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.274
- That's not true.
- No?

37:13.318 --> 37:16.799
It doesn't matter what's true
or not true, you understand?

37:16.843 --> 37:19.715
What matters is
what I can prove.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.848
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

37:21.891 --> 37:24.242
I'm saying I got you
on this murder.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.418
We know Trey owed you money.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.985
We know you went
to Trey's apartment.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.031
And we know
you told Jordan Atwater

37:31.074 --> 37:32.554
you're the one
that killed him.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.557
- The only thing we don't know
is your side of the story.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.733
So if you tell us the truth,
we can help you.

37:44.305 --> 37:48.918
- I went to Trey's to get that
thousand dollars he owed me.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.182
He told me, "Get out."

37:55.098 --> 37:57.884
I was so tired
of the way he acted,

37:57.927 --> 37:59.799
the way he treated me.

38:03.150 --> 38:09.330
And then I saw his gun
sitting on the table, so...

38:09.374 --> 38:10.723
I grabbed it.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.727
Told him to pay me.

38:14.770 --> 38:17.686
He just laughed.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.166
Called me a whore.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.824
And then I heard this loud...

38:26.434 --> 38:28.306
Pop.

38:35.661 --> 38:38.141
He was on the floor, bleeding.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.857
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:57.900 --> 39:01.687
- I got your badge and
undercover phone from before.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.471
- Before it all went to hell?

39:03.515 --> 39:06.082
- Yeah.
Here, let me give you a hand.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.830
- Listen, um...

39:14.874 --> 39:17.920
when you were in surgery,

39:17.964 --> 39:20.358
no one knew
what was gonna happen.

39:21.837 --> 39:25.363
And it made me realize that...

39:25.406 --> 39:27.016
I wanted to tell you something.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.240
- Okay.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.387
It's Bobby.
It's Angela's son.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.172
- What are you doing?

39:52.215 --> 39:54.827
- I want to make sure
he's okay.

39:54.870 --> 39:58.352
- Hey, he's with his mom.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.094
He's okay.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.706
You just caught a bullet
for this.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.449
You gotta let this one go.

40:11.496 --> 40:12.888
Just let it go.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.371
- All right.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.029
What were you gonna say?

40:27.381 --> 40:29.427
- Never mind, I'm gonna
pull the car around.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.558
I'll meet you in front.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.625
- Jordan?

40:53.668 --> 40:57.237
Jordan, where are you at?

40:57.280 --> 40:59.282
I need you
to call me back, bro.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.199
Love.
