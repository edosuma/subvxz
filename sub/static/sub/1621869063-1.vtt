WEBVTT

00:24.339 --> 00:26.275
All right, thank you.

00:32.814 --> 00:35.651
Hi, how are you, beautiful?

00:35.684 --> 00:37.753
There you go, hot and waiting
for you.

00:37.785 --> 00:38.586
Thank you so much.

00:38.620 --> 00:39.622
- Good night.
- Thank you.

00:39.654 --> 00:40.822
Good night.

00:40.855 --> 00:42.957
All right, let's shut it down,
huh?

00:42.991 --> 00:44.594
Oh good, going home.

00:47.361 --> 00:49.097
Okay, motherfuckers, let's go!

00:49.131 --> 00:52.101
Give me what I want or I'll
give you what you don't want.

00:52.134 --> 00:55.237
Give the money right
now, you wop, let's go.

00:57.772 --> 00:58.641
Hurry up!

01:01.342 --> 01:03.144
Okay, okay, please.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.315
Hurry up, give it to me.

01:06.348 --> 01:09.117
All right, all right,
you got what you came for.

01:09.150 --> 01:10.819
Leave.

01:10.852 --> 01:12.354
What the fuck you looking at?

01:12.387 --> 01:15.324
That's not all the money.

01:15.357 --> 01:18.861
What the fuck you said?

01:18.893 --> 01:19.994
That's not all the money.

01:20.027 --> 01:21.997
The old wop got a safe in the
back.

01:26.301 --> 01:28.870
You heard the little nigger,
let's go.

01:28.903 --> 01:29.771
Okay, okay.

01:31.940 --> 01:33.976
What the fuck you waiting on,
let's go.

01:34.976 --> 01:36.411
This shit is not a game.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.245
Get out my way!

01:37.278 --> 01:38.214
Little nigger, where is the
safe?

01:38.247 --> 01:40.114
Second bottom drawer
of the file cabinet.

01:40.147 --> 01:42.784
Jump to it, motherfucker,
let's go.

01:42.818 --> 01:43.819
Okay, okay.

01:43.852 --> 01:46.188
Get the money, cracker nigger!

01:46.221 --> 01:47.222
I will kill your woman.

01:47.254 --> 01:48.857
Just give him the money!

01:48.890 --> 01:51.326
Hurry the fuck up and get my
money!

01:51.358 --> 01:54.328
Put the money in the bag, all of
it.

01:54.361 --> 01:57.098
God, I hate to rob you, my
niggas, yes.

01:57.131 --> 01:57.965
Let's go!

01:57.998 --> 01:58.833
Hurry, Roberto!

01:58.866 --> 02:01.736
Nigger, today, listen to your
bitch.

02:01.769 --> 02:03.137
I got shit to do.

02:03.170 --> 02:04.238
Give me my fucking money.

02:04.271 --> 02:05.740
Any more money left?

02:17.285 --> 02:19.888
This is one nice fucking
piece.

02:19.921 --> 02:23.257
Like my wife, almost too
fucking pretty to shoot.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.928
I'll tell you what, I'll
take the lot of them.

02:25.961 --> 02:28.831
Go see Frankie in the back,
he'll set you straight.

02:28.863 --> 02:31.099
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you
going, heh?

02:31.132 --> 02:33.000
Come on, I open up the joint in
an hour.

02:33.034 --> 02:35.237
You think I want my
customers to look at these?

02:36.872 --> 02:38.339
Hey, hey, hey!

02:38.373 --> 02:40.274
There he is, this is him.

02:40.308 --> 02:42.745
Look who's here, the man of
the hour.

02:42.778 --> 02:44.179
How you doing, kid?

02:44.212 --> 02:45.214
What's your name?

02:45.247 --> 02:46.348
Bernard James.

02:46.380 --> 02:47.248
Bernard, heh?

02:48.116 --> 02:51.086
I tell you the truth, I
appreciate what you did, kid.

02:51.118 --> 02:53.955
But the truth be told, if
you didn't open your mouth

02:53.988 --> 02:56.759
about the safe, we wouldn't
be here in the first place.

02:56.791 --> 02:58.993
What the fuck were you thinking
about,

02:59.027 --> 03:02.498
jeopardizing my fucking money
for fucking pizza money?

03:02.530 --> 03:05.467
Roberto gave me a job to
help take care of my mom.

03:05.499 --> 03:08.002
I like Roberto, he's a good man.

03:11.273 --> 03:12.441
I like you, kid.

03:12.474 --> 03:14.443
I like a kid who stands up for
his friends

03:14.475 --> 03:16.110
and takes care of his mother.

03:16.143 --> 03:17.445
You're good in my book.

03:18.146 --> 03:22.551
But one thing I'm not too crazy
about is your name, Bernard.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.987
I don't know, you don't
look like a Bernard.

03:27.388 --> 03:28.491
What do I look like?

03:29.325 --> 03:32.327
There was a guy I
come up with years ago,

03:32.360 --> 03:34.129
he didn't take shit from nobody.

03:34.161 --> 03:36.464
He saved my life once, God rest
his soul.

03:36.498 --> 03:39.167
He had fucking steel balls just
like you.

03:40.135 --> 03:42.171
His name was Dutch.

03:42.203 --> 03:43.772
How about we call you Dutch?

03:44.439 --> 03:48.876
Dutch, yeah, it'd be
an honor, Mr. Cerrone.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.446
All right, Roberto, hook
him up with the chop shop

03:51.479 --> 03:52.513
in North Newark, all right.

03:52.547 --> 03:53.448
All right.

03:53.481 --> 03:55.516
Let the kid start earning for
a living.

03:55.550 --> 03:56.517
You hungry, kid?

03:56.551 --> 03:58.921
I got a guy in the back
fix you a fucking plate

03:58.953 --> 04:01.422
of spaghetti make your hair
curl.

05:19.566 --> 05:21.168
Have them bring my usual.

05:21.201 --> 05:22.470
I'll be at my table in a few
minutes.

05:22.504 --> 05:24.672
Sure, Miss Nichols.

06:07.381 --> 06:09.518
Excuse me, but you're
at the wrong table.

06:10.549 --> 06:11.252
Not if you're Michelle
Nichols.

06:12.153 --> 06:13.121
Food is important to me.

06:13.153 --> 06:14.622
I don't like being
interrupted while eating.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.490
Make an appointment and
see me at my office.

06:16.523 --> 06:18.025
Well, it's kind of an urgent
matter.

06:18.059 --> 06:19.261
They all are.

06:20.362 --> 06:21.263
Bernard James.

06:22.263 --> 06:23.131
Dutch.

06:23.163 --> 06:24.031
Nice to meet you.

06:24.064 --> 06:25.466
You're a drug dealer.

06:25.499 --> 06:27.302
Does that scare you?

06:27.335 --> 06:29.137
I'm a criminal defense
attorney, Mr. James,

06:29.170 --> 06:30.372
very little scares me.

06:31.638 --> 06:33.542
This is a certified check.

06:33.574 --> 06:35.977
You're incredibly naive if
you think you're the only rich

06:36.011 --> 06:38.679
drug dealer in New Jersey who
needs my services, Mr. James.

06:38.713 --> 06:41.482
Ms. Nichols, I'm not being
arrested for selling narcotics.

06:41.516 --> 06:42.684
What are you being arrested
for?

06:42.716 --> 06:43.551
Being black.

06:43.585 --> 06:44.419
That's not a crime.

06:44.451 --> 06:45.687
Who's being naive now?

06:47.521 --> 06:50.091
Black men are incarcerated six
times the rate of white males

06:50.124 --> 06:51.360
if they're not killed first.

06:51.393 --> 06:54.029
That's your defense because
white people get away with it,

06:54.062 --> 06:54.963
you should too?

06:54.997 --> 06:57.232
Oh, if you think it'll work,
I'm game.

07:00.268 --> 07:01.670
I appreciate the offer, Mr.
James,

07:01.703 --> 07:03.638
but I don't think I can
represent you.

07:03.670 --> 07:04.872
Any particular reason why not?

07:04.905 --> 07:08.242
No, but you haven't given
me a good reason why I should.

07:08.275 --> 07:09.543
Well, Johnny Cochran wasn't
available.

07:09.576 --> 07:11.245
And you're not very funny.

07:11.278 --> 07:14.348
Oh, no disrespect to Johnny
Cochran, God rest his soul.

07:14.381 --> 07:16.650
I meant it as a testament
of your legal skill.

07:16.684 --> 07:17.785
The system is corrupt,

07:17.819 --> 07:19.321
I just happen to care a little
bit more

07:19.353 --> 07:21.789
than the people who work in the
system.

07:21.823 --> 07:24.559
Oh, I think it's a
little bit more than that.

07:24.591 --> 07:25.693
You're a true believer.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.566
People of color are incapable
of receiving equality

07:32.600 --> 07:35.369
of justice in the
American judicial system.

07:35.403 --> 07:36.271
Sound familiar?

07:37.638 --> 07:39.441
Fundamental principles
of the Sixth Amendment

07:39.473 --> 07:42.576
are systematically undermined
by racism, economic disparity

07:42.610 --> 07:44.013
and political oppression.

07:45.246 --> 07:46.615
Are these your words?

07:46.648 --> 07:48.383
How'd you get that?

07:48.415 --> 07:50.384
It's good, it's better than
good.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.386
I know what it is, I wrote
it second year Harvard Law,

07:52.420 --> 07:53.489
what's your point?

07:54.489 --> 07:56.590
We both believe in justice.

07:56.624 --> 07:58.727
Now, I've been to prison, Ms.
Nichols.

07:58.759 --> 08:01.495
It's not a pleasant place
and I'm never going back.

08:01.528 --> 08:03.432
If I can't get a fair
trial with you in court,

08:03.465 --> 08:05.434
I'll hold court on the streets.

08:05.466 --> 08:06.367
That would be suicide.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.037
No, it would be self defense.

08:09.603 --> 08:11.672
What exactly are you being
charged with?

08:13.607 --> 08:15.376
I think they'll know better
than me.

08:27.722 --> 08:30.192
Bernard James,
you're under arrest.

08:31.391 --> 08:32.261
Cuff him.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.532
He better look as good as he
does now

08:38.565 --> 08:39.867
after he gets to booking.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.303
Who the hell are you?

08:41.335 --> 08:43.671
Michelle Nichols, his
attorney.

09:00.788 --> 09:03.291
Good morning, you're
watching Wake Up New Jersey.

09:03.324 --> 09:05.327
I'm David Greenwood, we're
glad you could be here.

09:05.359 --> 09:07.761
Let's get right to the top
story of the day, shall we?

09:07.795 --> 09:10.899
It has now been six months
since alleged drug dealer,

09:10.931 --> 09:14.168
Bernard Dutch James was arrested
at a New Jersey restaurant.

09:14.202 --> 09:16.505
Now, ironically, Mr.
James was not picked up

09:16.538 --> 09:18.206
for a drug-related offense,

09:18.238 --> 09:20.742
rather this is more serious than
that.

09:20.775 --> 09:23.511
He's been charged with
orchestrating the mass bombing

09:23.545 --> 09:26.147
of a New Jersey police
station that led to the deaths

09:26.180 --> 09:30.417
of 27 good officers and the
wounding of scores more.

09:30.450 --> 09:33.387
It's an act many are calling
terrorism.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.491
Now, Bernard James has always
denied these accusations

09:36.524 --> 09:39.528
through his attorney, Michelle
Nichols, who just so happens

09:39.560 --> 09:41.896
to be our guest on the program
today.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.098
Thank you for
having me.

09:43.131 --> 09:45.766
Now, I gotta say, Michelle,
when our viewers found out

09:45.800 --> 09:48.270
that you were gonna be on the
program,

09:48.303 --> 09:50.804
our social media pages basically
shut down

09:50.838 --> 09:53.675
with the sheer amount of
comments people were leaving.

09:53.708 --> 09:54.642
Well, I don't
know if that's good or bad.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.645
Well, I've
been going through a lot

09:56.678 --> 09:59.780
of these comments and many of
them are less than flattering

09:59.814 --> 10:01.616
towards you and your client.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.684
And a good number of
them aren't even suitable

10:03.718 --> 10:05.886
to air on television.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.755
Does that worry you?

10:06.788 --> 10:08.924
You know what worries me

10:08.957 --> 10:11.359
and it should worry your
audience, too?

10:11.391 --> 10:13.862
The Constitution mandates that
everyone should be afforded

10:13.895 --> 10:16.731
a good and capable defense, not
just...

10:16.764 --> 10:18.433
Yo, turn this up.

10:19.132 --> 10:21.636
People get caught up in the
sound bytes on the internet

10:21.669 --> 10:23.237
and suddenly volunteer

10:23.271 --> 10:24.905
to abandon their Constitutional
rights

10:24.939 --> 10:27.742
because they're not aware of the
facts.

10:27.775 --> 10:28.610
Well, here we go.

10:28.642 --> 10:30.411
What are the facts?

10:30.444 --> 10:32.314
Anthony Jacobs
knows that William Brent

10:32.347 --> 10:35.917
is responsible for this
heinous crime, yet he insists

10:35.949 --> 10:39.220
on using the powers of the
district attorney's office

10:39.253 --> 10:40.454
to persecute Mr. James.

10:40.488 --> 10:43.857
But District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs believes your client

10:43.891 --> 10:46.227
is complicit with the
actions of William Brent.

10:46.261 --> 10:47.462
Well, you know what?

10:47.496 --> 10:50.298
I believe I can fly, but the
judicial system doesn't operate

10:50.330 --> 10:51.232
on what we believe.

10:51.266 --> 10:52.534
It's about what you can prove.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.703
And there is no evidence
of any malfeasance

10:54.736 --> 10:57.271
or of culpable intent by Mr.
James.

10:57.304 --> 10:58.640
You do need evidence.

10:58.673 --> 11:00.708
Just because a person has been
arrested,

11:00.742 --> 11:03.245
you can't automatically
conclude they're guilty.

11:06.747 --> 11:08.650
Documents were sent over.

11:08.683 --> 11:09.718
When did this happen?

11:09.751 --> 11:11.386
We're going in right now,
I gotta call you back.

11:11.419 --> 11:13.554
Michelle Nichols, saw you on
TV.

11:13.588 --> 11:14.655
You did an amazing job.

11:14.689 --> 11:15.957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.859
We want the Wake Up New Jersey
piece

11:17.891 --> 11:20.462
on all social media sites
and local news outlets.

11:22.396 --> 11:24.898
Wait, I gotta call you back.

11:27.501 --> 11:29.972
All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

11:37.745 --> 11:39.614
You may be seated.

11:39.646 --> 11:41.249
Bring in the jury.

11:49.089 --> 11:52.493
Is the state ready to proceed
with its opening statement?

11:52.526 --> 11:56.730
Hello, I am District
Attorney Anthony Jacobs

11:56.764 --> 12:01.503
and I wanna thank you for
your attendance today.

12:02.536 --> 12:06.440
I know some of you may deem
my gratitude unwarranted

12:06.473 --> 12:10.045
because let's be honest, if
you didn't have to be here,

12:10.078 --> 12:12.814
you probably wouldn't come,
right?

12:12.847 --> 12:13.715
And I agree.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.017
I'd much rather be playing golf

12:16.050 --> 12:18.453
or going to my child's piano
recital

12:18.486 --> 12:20.655
or just enjoying a quiet day at
home.

12:21.622 --> 12:26.828
But I can't 'cause this is my
duty, just like it's your duty

12:27.093 --> 12:30.332
to assure your fellow
citizens will remain safe,

12:31.299 --> 12:33.934
just as it is the police to
do the same for you and I,

12:33.968 --> 12:35.036
our civic duty.

12:36.838 --> 12:38.073
But above and beyond our civic
duty,

12:38.106 --> 12:41.976
above and beyond the inconvenience
duty sometimes imposes

12:42.008 --> 12:45.579
on the dutiful, therefore it is
our right.

12:45.612 --> 12:48.049
It is your right to be safe in
your home.

12:48.082 --> 12:50.552
It is your right to
oversee the justice system

12:50.584 --> 12:53.054
and it is your right to
be heard as citizens,

12:54.454 --> 12:56.891
even if the uncivilized play
mockery

12:56.924 --> 12:58.492
with our sense of security.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.429
Now, we're all God-fearing
human beings and those of you

13:02.463 --> 13:04.565
who aren't, well, you wouldn't
be here

13:04.598 --> 13:06.100
if you didn't recognize the law.

13:07.934 --> 13:10.070
And you certainly
wouldn't be sitting there

13:10.103 --> 13:13.007
if you didn't know the difference
between right and wrong.

13:14.809 --> 13:18.146
So I say to you, what if
I could present to you

13:18.179 --> 13:21.415
the very embodiment of wrong?

13:22.382 --> 13:25.552
Would you hesitate to
look wrong in the face?

13:25.585 --> 13:28.055
Would you banish wrong from our
society?

13:28.088 --> 13:29.491
Would you turn away from guilt

13:29.524 --> 13:32.694
if it was staring you right in
the face?

13:32.727 --> 13:34.596
Well, I'm gonna give you that
chance.

13:35.362 --> 13:38.098
Because I'm gonna prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

13:38.131 --> 13:42.971
that Bernard James is the
embodiment of this city's wrong.

13:43.003 --> 13:46.640
He is the root cause of fear
that is prevalent in this city

13:46.674 --> 13:50.578
and the degradation of our civil
order.

13:50.611 --> 13:54.049
It all stems from the
actions of this one man.

13:54.982 --> 14:00.388
Bernard James is an
instigator, an agitator

14:00.988 --> 14:02.089
and head of the organized crime

14:02.123 --> 14:05.893
that has terrorized New
Jersey for the past 12 years.

14:05.926 --> 14:09.663
You have a chance to look evil
in the face and in the name

14:09.697 --> 14:13.602
of the state of New Jersey,
you say one word, guilty.

14:27.548 --> 14:28.417
Thank you.

14:31.549 --> 14:33.021
As the day is drawing long,
we'll continue these proceedings

14:33.054 --> 14:35.088
tomorrow morning at 9 AM.

14:35.122 --> 14:35.957
Your honor.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.058
Thank you, Ms. Nichols.

14:37.091 --> 14:38.193
Relax.

14:38.226 --> 14:40.128
Court is now
adjourned.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.261
And let Jacobs'
statement be the last thing

14:41.295 --> 14:43.665
the jury remembers before
they go to sleep tonight?

14:43.698 --> 14:45.634
Don't worry about it.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.973
Hi, this is Lady
D.

14:53.006 --> 14:55.609
I'm not available to
take your call right now.

14:55.642 --> 14:58.579
Please leave a message at the
tone.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.703
Dutch had assembled
a young team of raiders

15:22.737 --> 15:25.506
from all over New York
to steal cars as a kid.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.674
And he was arrested and sent

15:26.707 --> 15:28.242
to Mountain View Correctional
Facility

15:28.275 --> 15:31.112
for trying to steal a
dozen BMWs at the port.

15:31.145 --> 15:33.114
BMWs?

15:48.663 --> 15:49.864
Y'all wanna make this shit
interesting?

15:49.897 --> 15:53.233
Shit, shooting motherfuckers,
that'll make it interesting.

15:53.266 --> 15:56.136
Shit, that's your answer for
everything.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.872
What's better than that,
Angel?

15:57.905 --> 15:59.006
Money.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.041
What you thinking, Dutch?

16:01.074 --> 16:03.310
I'm thinking whoever
has the fastest time,

16:03.343 --> 16:05.679
the other three throw them a G
apiece.

16:05.713 --> 16:09.217
Ooh, extra three grand, I'm
in.

16:12.185 --> 16:14.321
All right then, let's do it.

16:40.314 --> 16:41.849
You wanna roll?

17:07.340 --> 17:08.909
Share.

17:08.943 --> 17:09.944
Yes, sir.

17:09.976 --> 17:11.845
Everybody give Angel her
share.

17:11.878 --> 17:12.646
She did that.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.882
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a
minute.

17:14.915 --> 17:17.318
Y'all know I was way faster than
Angel.

17:17.350 --> 17:18.386
Yeah, you would've been

17:18.418 --> 17:20.954
if you didn't waste time
picking up random bitches.

17:20.988 --> 17:21.856
Man, whatever.

17:22.690 --> 17:24.792
Hey, look, I ain't even
mad at you, man, 'cause look,

17:24.825 --> 17:26.995
I see what it got you, playboy.

17:27.028 --> 17:29.130
I ain't mad at you, go ahead.

17:29.163 --> 17:30.198
Here, take your little money.

17:30.231 --> 17:30.898
Yeah, come over here.

17:30.932 --> 17:32.099
I got you, you know I got you.

17:32.133 --> 17:32.967
I ain't tripping about that.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.368
Mine is in there.

17:34.402 --> 17:36.136
Whatever they want, it's on
me.

17:38.305 --> 17:39.841
Roberto, man.

17:39.874 --> 17:40.842
How you doing, kid?

17:40.875 --> 17:41.675
- Good, you?
- Good.

17:41.709 --> 17:42.777
You remember Qwan, Angel and
Craze.

17:42.809 --> 17:44.111
Hey, how are y'all doing?

17:44.145 --> 17:47.181
Oh man, we doing real good.

17:47.213 --> 17:49.082
You got a minute, I need to
talk to you.

17:49.116 --> 17:51.685
Yeah, whatever you want.

17:51.719 --> 17:52.886
Get something to drink, man.

17:52.919 --> 17:53.854
Hey, bartender.

17:53.887 --> 17:54.722
$100 to the bartender.

17:54.754 --> 17:56.924
So what's going on?

17:56.956 --> 17:59.326
Fat Tony wanted me to talk to
you.

17:59.359 --> 18:00.261
What, we do something wrong?

18:00.293 --> 18:02.229
Nah, no, no not at all.

18:02.262 --> 18:03.897
I think you been doing a great
job.

18:03.931 --> 18:05.967
In fact, they wanted me to give
you this.

18:08.101 --> 18:11.872
Damn, I don't even know
what to say, but thank you.

18:11.905 --> 18:13.308
And there's more, all right.

18:16.911 --> 18:18.379
He's taking you out of the car
business

18:18.412 --> 18:20.014
and putting you into narcotics.

18:20.047 --> 18:20.848
Man, what you mean he wanna
take us out

18:20.880 --> 18:21.815
of the car business?

18:21.848 --> 18:23.684
No, no, no, it's a
good thing, all right.

18:23.717 --> 18:26.286
With your street connections,
it just makes sense.

18:26.319 --> 18:28.056
You're gonna be working under
Frank.

18:28.088 --> 18:29.823
You're gonna be making 10 times
the money

18:29.857 --> 18:31.358
and have 10 times the
responsibility.

18:31.392 --> 18:33.261
You think you can handle that?

18:33.293 --> 18:36.363
Man, they haven't invented
a hustle I can't handle.

18:36.396 --> 18:37.732
But what about my team?

18:37.764 --> 18:38.732
Yeah, hire whoever you want.

18:38.765 --> 18:40.467
There's enough money to
go around for everybody,

18:40.501 --> 18:44.405
but if they shit on you,
that's your problem.

18:44.437 --> 18:47.841
If they shit on us,
that's your problem, too.

18:50.444 --> 18:53.280
And Frank is okay with that?

18:53.313 --> 18:55.082
Comes from Fat Tony.

18:55.116 --> 18:57.251
Frank doesn't have a choice
in the matter, all right.

18:57.283 --> 18:59.486
But there's this guy.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.490
He's got a 1956 Bel Air
Coupe, a real beauty.

19:02.522 --> 19:03.890
Frank tried to buy it from the
guy,

19:03.924 --> 19:05.193
but the guy wouldn't budge.

19:06.059 --> 19:10.364
It would go a long way to
smooth things out with Frank

19:10.396 --> 19:12.300
if you could get him that car.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.902
You just tell me where
it's at and it's yours.

19:14.934 --> 19:17.739
According to Frank, the
guy goes to Joe's Steakhouse

19:17.771 --> 19:22.711
every day at 7 like clockwork,
parks with the valet.

19:24.411 --> 19:25.914
You can consider it done.

19:27.181 --> 19:28.883
Congratulations.

19:28.915 --> 19:30.751
You've come a long way, kid,
huh?

19:32.252 --> 19:34.822
I gotta give it to him,
he never thought small.

19:42.428 --> 19:43.363
Hello, Mrs. Jasmine.

19:43.396 --> 19:44.299
How are we doing?

19:45.265 --> 19:46.399
I see you're doing well.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.102
- Thank you.
- Absolutely, welcome back.

19:48.135 --> 19:49.904
Thank you.

19:49.936 --> 19:50.538
Park up front.

19:50.570 --> 19:51.905
Always, yes sir.

20:04.385 --> 20:05.353
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

20:05.386 --> 20:07.422
Can you help me get a
package out of my trunk?

20:08.355 --> 20:09.891
Sure, where's it at?

20:12.193 --> 20:14.060
- Right in here?
- Yeah.

20:14.094 --> 20:15.263
Where's it at right here?

20:15.296 --> 20:16.164
What the...

20:44.425 --> 20:46.828
We've been set up.

20:49.562 --> 20:50.564
Get out of the car.

20:50.598 --> 20:52.867
Out of the car, face forward.

20:52.899 --> 20:53.533
Face forward!

20:53.567 --> 20:55.001
Get down, get down.

20:55.034 --> 20:57.304
Spread out, put your
hands behind your head.

20:59.205 --> 21:01.274
Another kid was arrested
with him, Eqwan Taylor.

21:01.308 --> 21:02.577
He was sent to Jamesburg.

21:02.609 --> 21:03.477
Gladiator camp.

21:05.945 --> 21:08.115
Eqwan Taylor was just added
to Jacob's witness list.

21:08.147 --> 21:10.251
He's the reverend at First
Street Baptist Church

21:10.283 --> 21:11.484
in Los Angeles.

21:11.519 --> 21:14.555
Jacobs is using Taylor to
introduce Dutch's criminal past

21:14.588 --> 21:15.923
to the jury.

21:15.955 --> 21:16.623
Then we're gonna take a hit.

21:16.656 --> 21:17.558
Maybe not, do we have anything

21:17.590 --> 21:20.126
to impeach the good reverend's
testimony?

21:20.159 --> 21:21.995
Nothing yet, but our
investigators

21:22.029 --> 21:22.997
are still in LA working on it.

21:23.030 --> 21:24.365
Get them to work faster.

21:24.397 --> 21:27.100
In the meantime, I'm gonna
gut Jacobs' first witness.

21:31.437 --> 21:34.242
Can you state your
name for the court, sir?

21:34.274 --> 21:35.209
Kenneth Jackson.

21:36.409 --> 21:38.445
And where do you
currently reside?

21:39.346 --> 21:41.583
In a halfway house off of
Broad Street.

21:43.951 --> 21:45.886
And do you know Bernard James?

21:45.919 --> 21:48.021
Of course I do, who don't?

21:48.955 --> 21:50.324
He's sitting right over there.

21:51.692 --> 21:53.594
And when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

21:53.626 --> 21:55.328
- Objection.
- Overruled.

21:55.361 --> 21:58.531
Again, when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

21:58.565 --> 22:00.568
Not until he came to Mountain
View.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.435
And that would be Mountain
View

22:02.469 --> 22:04.672
Correctional Facility, right?

22:04.704 --> 22:05.639
Yes, sir.

22:05.673 --> 22:08.476
And can you describe
Bernard James's stay

22:08.509 --> 22:10.478
at Mountain View correctional
facility?

22:11.611 --> 22:14.080
Well, from the jump, Dutch
came in like he had something

22:14.114 --> 22:16.951
to prove, like he had
a chip in his shoulder.

22:16.983 --> 22:18.551
He wasn't inside five minutes

22:18.585 --> 22:20.688
and he was already stirring up
shit.

22:23.957 --> 22:26.359
So Bernard James came into
prison a violent person,

22:26.393 --> 22:27.227
is that correct?

22:27.261 --> 22:29.597
I mean, he wasn't a killer or
nothing,

22:29.629 --> 22:32.433
but he definitely made his
presence known.

22:32.465 --> 22:34.334
And I respected that.

22:34.367 --> 22:37.405
Was there any gang
activity at Mountain View?

22:37.437 --> 22:40.040
Everybody was in a gang, if
that's what you wanna call it.

22:40.073 --> 22:41.241
It was just cliqued up.

22:42.276 --> 22:46.180
I mean, they got together
on a county versus county

22:46.847 --> 22:50.017
or a city versus city basis.

22:50.050 --> 22:50.918
Narc, nigga.

22:52.152 --> 22:53.087
Fuck off me, man.

22:53.119 --> 22:55.423
Sometimes it's street
versus street basis.

22:55.455 --> 22:57.190
It depended on where you were at

22:57.223 --> 22:58.659
to determine who you were with.

23:00.394 --> 23:03.463
Now, I'm gonna ask you

23:03.496 --> 23:05.999
was Bernard James involved in a
gang?

23:11.605 --> 23:14.107
Everybody was, especially him.

23:15.376 --> 23:16.210
Especially?

23:16.242 --> 23:18.178
Dutch ran Mountain View.

23:18.212 --> 23:21.516
And if Newark was brought
up, he would be frontline.

23:22.482 --> 23:25.153
He was the man, bottom line.

23:28.655 --> 23:29.523
Thank you.

23:31.524 --> 23:32.592
Your witness.

23:34.028 --> 23:36.163
Mr. Jackson, you
testified that everybody

23:36.195 --> 23:37.697
at Mountain View was in a gang.

23:37.731 --> 23:38.598
That's right.

23:42.735 --> 23:45.272
So were you in a gang?

23:46.572 --> 23:49.576
Like I said, everybody was.

23:49.609 --> 23:51.311
And if one gang member had a
problem

23:51.345 --> 23:54.248
with another gang member,
they would do anything

23:54.280 --> 23:56.050
to take them out, right?

23:57.117 --> 23:58.085
Wasn't no picnic.

23:58.117 --> 24:00.053
You had to do what you
had to do to survive.

24:00.087 --> 24:01.388
Like what?

24:01.422 --> 24:03.024
Whatever it took.

24:03.057 --> 24:03.724
Lie?

24:06.260 --> 24:07.094
That's the least of it.

24:07.126 --> 24:08.662
Kill?

24:08.694 --> 24:11.098
Guards won't let you kill
nobody, but short of it.

24:11.130 --> 24:12.165
Good for them.

24:13.399 --> 24:14.401
Are you from Newark?

24:16.369 --> 24:17.338
No, ma'am.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.773
I'm from North Bergen
Township, Hudson County.

24:19.807 --> 24:22.777
A lot of tough guys
come out of North Bergen.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.146
You'd be surprised,
ma'am.

24:25.178 --> 24:26.280
Are you a tough guy?

24:27.380 --> 24:29.216
Let's just say I can hold my
own.

24:30.451 --> 24:33.421
And you and Mr. James
were in a rival gang

24:33.453 --> 24:35.289
at Mountain View, right?

24:36.290 --> 24:37.590
What are you talking about?

24:37.624 --> 24:39.693
You said earlier that
inmates at Mountain View

24:39.725 --> 24:42.396
got together on a county versus
county

24:42.428 --> 24:44.764
or city versus city basis.

24:44.798 --> 24:47.801
Mr. James is from Newark,
you're from North Bergen,

24:47.835 --> 24:50.538
therefore you're rivals, right?

24:50.570 --> 24:52.173
We wasn't homies or nothing
like that

24:52.205 --> 24:53.040
if that's what you asking.

24:53.073 --> 24:54.541
That's why you're here
testifying today

24:54.575 --> 24:57.211
because you and Mr. James were
rivals

24:57.243 --> 24:58.611
and a gang member will do
anything

24:58.645 --> 25:01.281
to take out a rival gang member,
right?

25:01.315 --> 25:02.482
I don't know what you're
talking about.

25:02.515 --> 25:04.184
So it wasn't true when you
say lying is the very least

25:04.217 --> 25:06.519
you would do take out a rival
gang member?

25:06.552 --> 25:07.854
Were you lying then or were you
lying now?

25:07.887 --> 25:09.589
Which is it, Mr. Jackson?

25:09.623 --> 25:11.425
Objection, argumentative.

25:11.457 --> 25:12.426
Sustained.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.263
Mr. Jackson, one last
question.

25:17.297 --> 25:20.233
Where are you staying
while appearing in court?

25:20.267 --> 25:22.303
The district attorney's
office put me up at the Hilton.

25:22.336 --> 25:24.371
I'd imagine the Hilton is a
lot nicer

25:24.404 --> 25:26.740
than the halfway house on Broad
Street.

25:26.772 --> 25:27.907
Objection.

25:27.941 --> 25:31.779
Withdrawn, I'm done with
this liar, I mean, witness.

25:46.792 --> 25:47.661
Jacobs.

25:49.163 --> 25:51.566
Gah, shit, it was supposed
to be done an hour ago.

25:52.566 --> 25:53.667
What time?

25:53.700 --> 25:55.669
5:30, it's gonna be ready.

25:55.702 --> 25:57.637
But look, if I can't make
it, let's just leave the keys

25:57.671 --> 25:58.905
at the service department.

25:58.938 --> 26:00.406
Yeah, I know.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.576
All right, bye, thanks.

26:02.576 --> 26:05.179
I'm going to visit Roc and Angel

26:05.212 --> 26:06.413
and I'm gonna make them a deal.

26:06.445 --> 26:07.314
Okay.

26:17.691 --> 26:18.826
There he is.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.828
Roc, right?

26:22.261 --> 26:24.397
I am District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

26:25.499 --> 26:26.567
They treating you well in here?

26:26.599 --> 26:29.669
District attorney Anthony
Jacobs, what you want?

26:31.271 --> 26:33.773
Look, we know you're
not top of the chain.

26:34.607 --> 26:37.845
We know it's Bernard James,
Dutch.

26:39.413 --> 26:42.415
Now, I could cut a deal with you
right now

26:42.448 --> 26:45.485
and have you back on the
streets in less than a month.

26:45.519 --> 26:47.788
The only thing I want is Dutch.

26:51.325 --> 26:52.927
You must not know me.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.228
I ain't no snitch.

26:55.896 --> 26:56.797
I respect that.

26:58.632 --> 27:00.601
Oh, what was I thinking?

27:01.734 --> 27:03.771
Congrats, on the baby, right?

27:03.803 --> 27:05.838
What did you have a boy or a
girl?

27:05.871 --> 27:07.072
I guess it really doesn't matter

27:07.107 --> 27:10.478
because you won't be seeing
him or her for quite some time.

27:11.578 --> 27:15.316
Now, what did you tell Aisha
that you didn't want your kids

27:15.348 --> 27:19.619
to see you caged like an animal?

27:24.023 --> 27:27.493
Look, get me some McDonald's.

27:27.527 --> 27:29.797
When you come back, I
might remember something.

27:30.864 --> 27:31.531
Can you do that?

27:31.565 --> 27:34.934
Oh yeah, Big Mac, fries, Coke?

27:34.967 --> 27:36.236
- Yeah.
- Done.

27:47.981 --> 27:49.517
How was the meal?

27:50.550 --> 27:52.286
This'll last me till I get
out.

27:52.319 --> 27:54.488
Okay, well, I guess we can
talk

27:54.521 --> 27:57.657
about the bombing at the police
precinct.

28:01.427 --> 28:05.431
Look, I already told you.

28:05.464 --> 28:07.001
I ain't no fucking snitch.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.035
Get the fuck outta here.

28:09.069 --> 28:13.473
Wait a second, I thought
we had a deal here.

28:13.507 --> 28:15.643
Yeah, the deal is get
the fuck outta here.

28:16.643 --> 28:18.679
You're making a big mistake.

28:18.712 --> 28:22.282
You will never see the light
of day, I guarantee it.

28:22.316 --> 28:23.617
Get the fuck outta here!

28:43.036 --> 28:44.038
Get dressed.

29:03.956 --> 29:05.925
Hands behind
your back, inmate.

29:13.966 --> 29:16.803
What the fuck do you want?

29:16.837 --> 29:19.106
You're a very pretty girl,
Angel.

29:19.138 --> 29:24.344
Oh,

29:24.578 --> 29:26.446
Let's see here.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.848
Possession with the intent to
distribute,

29:29.915 --> 29:31.085
accessory to murder.

29:32.685 --> 29:33.953
That's 20 to life.

29:34.687 --> 29:39.359
You won't be so pretty when
you get out, if you get out.

29:41.861 --> 29:45.899
Yeah, look, I know how
much Dutch meant to you.

29:46.599 --> 29:49.102
Took you out of that
hellhole on Dayton Street,

29:49.770 --> 29:53.440
but you were young,
impressionable.

29:53.473 --> 29:54.942
You didn't know what you were
doing.

29:54.974 --> 29:57.410
And now, look where you are now.

29:59.078 --> 30:01.749
I can make your time here
easier.

30:04.417 --> 30:07.687
Do yourself a favor, testify
against him.

30:08.989 --> 30:11.725
I'm not a fucking snitch.

30:11.758 --> 30:13.427
I appreciate that loyalty.

30:15.729 --> 30:20.034
Let me ask you, would
Dutch do the same for you?

30:29.075 --> 30:31.678
Fuck you and fuck your deal.

30:31.711 --> 30:34.115
Get that fucking cunt out of
my face.

30:41.053 --> 30:43.189
I saw the way the jury
watched you, they like you.

30:43.223 --> 30:44.892
They want you to win this.

30:44.925 --> 30:47.594
I can dazzle the jury
with clever rhetoric,

30:47.626 --> 30:50.798
make the men want me, make
the women wanna be me,

30:50.830 --> 30:53.166
but when the show is over,
nothing is going to be able

30:53.200 --> 30:54.568
to blind them from the fact

30:54.600 --> 30:57.703
that there are 27 police
officers dead

30:57.736 --> 31:00.073
and they're gonna want
someone to answer for it.

31:05.712 --> 31:08.015
And that is gonna be Bernard
James.

31:12.551 --> 31:14.588
You know what my wife tells
me?

31:14.620 --> 31:17.757
That you have a shitty boss
that makes you work too much.

31:17.790 --> 31:20.894
That trials aren't won by
clients, they're won by lawyers

31:20.926 --> 31:21.962
and you're gonna win it for him.

31:21.994 --> 31:23.996
That would be true if
our client was anyone else

31:24.030 --> 31:25.833
but Bernard James.

31:25.866 --> 31:28.535
His presence commands attention

31:28.568 --> 31:30.838
and the jury, they can't
take their eyes off him

31:30.870 --> 31:33.607
sitting there like a king
daring to find him guilty.

31:33.639 --> 31:35.541
But all we need is one
juror looking for a reason

31:35.575 --> 31:38.812
to let him go and you're
gonna be that reason.

32:08.241 --> 32:10.109
What have you got
me into?

32:11.176 --> 32:12.011
Good evening, counselor.

32:12.044 --> 32:14.046
What the fuck did you get me
into?

32:14.079 --> 32:14.915
I told you.

32:14.947 --> 32:16.050
Like hell you did.

32:19.118 --> 32:20.253
I told you everything you need
to know

32:20.287 --> 32:21.722
to represent me on this case.

32:21.754 --> 32:22.955
Now tell me everything I don't
know

32:22.989 --> 32:24.658
and I'll decide what's
important.

32:24.691 --> 32:25.659
That wasn't our agreement.

32:25.692 --> 32:27.661
Our agreement changed
the moment some nut case

32:27.694 --> 32:30.563
in a Monte Carlo did a
drive-by on my house.

32:32.132 --> 32:33.133
Are you sure it was a Monte
Carlo?

32:33.166 --> 32:35.135
I'm asking the questions
and you're answering

32:35.167 --> 32:36.936
or you're gonna need a new
lawyer.

32:57.290 --> 32:59.259
Ha-ha, it's been a
long time.

32:59.291 --> 33:00.226
Too long.

33:04.364 --> 33:08.302
Man, finally some fresh air,
free air.

33:08.335 --> 33:10.971
Nobody telling me what to do,
I'm good.

33:11.003 --> 33:11.871
Dutch!

33:12.973 --> 33:13.840
Hey!

33:15.809 --> 33:17.711
Ay Papi, you're out.

33:17.743 --> 33:19.780
I can't believe it, I missed you
so much.

33:20.579 --> 33:22.582
You know I wasn't gonna be
able to stop her from coming.

33:22.616 --> 33:23.817
Man, now I know I'm blessed.

33:23.850 --> 33:26.986
Two of my favorite people in
the world on the day I get out.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.722
And you've got a new ride.

33:28.754 --> 33:29.589
No shit.

33:29.623 --> 33:30.658
Real shit, bruh.

33:32.626 --> 33:33.293
Damn, let's get the fuck out
of here.

33:35.729 --> 33:37.097
Let's go.

33:37.129 --> 33:38.764
You free now.

33:50.944 --> 33:53.614
So where you wanna go
first, your mom's, Roberto,

33:53.646 --> 33:55.148
Fat Tony or some thots?

33:56.049 --> 33:56.916
My moms.

33:59.152 --> 34:01.355
Who poppin' in the streets now?

34:01.387 --> 34:03.956
This cat, Kazami, popped up
out of nowhere on Springfield

34:03.990 --> 34:06.359
after you got locked up
and started housing shit.

34:22.876 --> 34:24.410
You making this motherfucker
sound like a super hero

34:24.443 --> 34:25.478
or some shit.

34:25.511 --> 34:27.280
For real, within a year
Kazami took over Newark,

34:27.312 --> 34:29.415
Elizabeth, Linden and East
Orange,

34:29.448 --> 34:31.351
shit most of Jersey City
honestly.

34:34.453 --> 34:37.323
People thought dude was Haitian,
but he's really Nigerian,

34:37.356 --> 34:38.324
brought a whole crew with him

34:38.357 --> 34:41.127
that's used to guerrilla
warfare out in Africa.

34:52.738 --> 34:54.407
Fat Tony just let him do it?

34:54.441 --> 34:57.044
I mean, Frank Sorbonno
moved up in the family,

34:57.077 --> 35:01.314
put a couple hits out on
Kazami, missed twice, pathetic.

35:01.347 --> 35:04.117
That shit only gave
Kazami more street cred.

35:04.149 --> 35:06.452
Frank got Monte Carlo on him
now.

35:06.486 --> 35:08.455
Wait, you talking about that
Italian cat

35:08.488 --> 35:10.022
that be in the old Monte Carlo?

35:10.055 --> 35:10.823
Yep.

35:10.856 --> 35:12.124
No wonder they can't get
Kazami,

35:12.158 --> 35:14.227
Monte Carlo is shit for brains.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.696
Only reason he ain't been tipped
over

35:15.729 --> 35:18.298
is 'cause of police protection.

35:18.330 --> 35:19.966
So what are you doing?

35:19.999 --> 35:21.868
It's like I've been
stuck.

35:21.901 --> 35:24.937
I've known you forever
and it's always been us.

35:24.970 --> 35:27.940
Rock and Zoom my people
and Shock rest in peace

35:29.274 --> 35:30.910
but without you here on point,
man,

35:30.943 --> 35:33.212
it's like I ain't been
able to get no traction.

35:54.501 --> 35:55.368
Hey, Ma.

35:58.138 --> 35:59.740
When did you get home?

35:59.772 --> 36:00.874
Today, just now.

36:18.390 --> 36:19.992
So you moved, huh?

36:21.327 --> 36:22.196
Yeah.

36:29.169 --> 36:30.804
What did you do with all
the stuff I bought you?

36:30.836 --> 36:31.871
You bought?

36:33.039 --> 36:34.508
Ma, listen, I know I messed up

36:35.374 --> 36:37.376
and I know you're probably
mad at me, but you could have

36:37.410 --> 36:39.812
at least came and seen
me once or wrote back.

36:40.479 --> 36:43.783
I wrote you every week
and you just up and move?

36:45.084 --> 36:46.419
Well, that's 'cause you a
goddamn fool

36:46.452 --> 36:47.821
and you're a goddamn coward.

36:47.854 --> 36:50.022
And yeah, I was mad
not for what you did do

36:50.055 --> 36:51.524
but for what you didn't do.

36:53.225 --> 36:55.495
You let them lock you
up like you was a dog.

36:56.196 --> 36:58.132
And you expect me to write you.

36:59.332 --> 37:00.934
You must be crazy, boy.

37:01.667 --> 37:04.070
What I got to say you
don't want me to write.

37:05.604 --> 37:08.107
You let them take you away from
me.

37:08.140 --> 37:09.909
And you didn't do nothing about
it.

37:09.943 --> 37:12.879
And yeah, all that shit
that you bought me,

37:12.912 --> 37:14.114
I left it where it was.

37:14.147 --> 37:17.017
I let it rot, I left it.

37:18.984 --> 37:21.521
All that bullshit you
traded your freedom in for,

37:21.553 --> 37:22.888
you think I want that?

37:22.921 --> 37:24.824
You think that's what I want?

37:24.857 --> 37:26.160
You think I wanna keep that?

37:41.406 --> 37:42.307
I ain't going back.

37:42.341 --> 37:45.278
You damn right you're not
going back.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.546
I'll kill you myself.

37:46.578 --> 37:49.348
I'll kill you myself.

37:49.381 --> 37:52.919
Get off of me, get off of me.

37:56.589 --> 37:59.960
You go get what them people took
from you.

38:00.926 --> 38:04.997
Go back and get what the
people took from you.

38:09.368 --> 38:10.236
Bernard.

38:17.410 --> 38:20.180
Your mother seems like
a special type of woman.

38:20.213 --> 38:21.848
Imagine being raised by her.

38:22.981 --> 38:24.250
At some point in the near
future,

38:24.283 --> 38:25.986
we're gonna finish this
conversation.

38:26.952 --> 38:28.287
I could offer you protection.

38:28.321 --> 38:29.990
I'm good, trust me.

38:31.691 --> 38:33.393
Look, I didn't know they
were gonna come after you

38:33.426 --> 38:34.594
to get to me.

38:34.627 --> 38:37.164
You're doing a great job,
you can't lose your cool now.

38:38.064 --> 38:39.899
I win 98% of my cases,

38:39.932 --> 38:41.934
run a six-minute mile with a
.45.

38:41.968 --> 38:44.136
The last thing I'm gonna
do is lose my cool.

38:46.539 --> 38:47.607
Good night, Mr. James.

39:46.399 --> 39:48.268
Fuck you, Monte Carlo.

40:06.486 --> 40:08.488
Boy, Qwan wanna holla at you.

40:08.521 --> 40:10.223
What fat boy want?

40:10.256 --> 40:12.258
I don't know.

40:12.290 --> 40:13.292
All right.

40:19.064 --> 40:21.501
He ready for you.

40:32.477 --> 40:33.347
What up?

40:35.347 --> 40:38.117
Hey, I appreciate everything
you done for me, Dutch,

40:39.252 --> 40:41.688
but I be waking up sweating
tears.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.556
I can't tell the
difference between the two.

40:44.589 --> 40:47.493
And it's so many people out
here dying, it's too many.

40:47.526 --> 40:49.495
I be thinking somebody gonna
kill me

40:49.528 --> 40:51.731
or my mom or my sister.

40:52.531 --> 40:54.700
Don't you ever have thoughts
like that?

40:55.635 --> 40:56.502
No.

40:59.539 --> 41:02.508
Well, I do, man, I think about
it a lot.

41:02.542 --> 41:04.344
I couldn't live with
myself if I did something

41:04.377 --> 41:07.014
that would cause pain to my
family.

41:08.247 --> 41:10.817
It ain't in me no more, Dutch,
it ain't.

41:10.850 --> 41:13.587
If I said it was, I'd be
frontin'.

41:16.488 --> 41:17.723
Ain't no future in that.

41:19.191 --> 41:23.328
I know, man, so yo,
I'm moving out to L.A.

41:23.361 --> 41:24.664
I'm gonna stay with my aunt.

41:57.396 --> 41:59.598
I told you he wasn't
built for this shit.

41:59.631 --> 42:03.235
He knows too much, way too much.

42:03.269 --> 42:04.203
We shouldn't have let
him walk out of here.

42:04.236 --> 42:05.439
Let me take care of that.

42:06.671 --> 42:07.640
What he gonna do?

42:08.707 --> 42:09.876
Nothing but go to California

42:09.908 --> 42:11.811
and become some preacher or some
shit.

42:13.646 --> 42:14.513
Let him go.

42:16.515 --> 42:18.718
Shit, if that's what he
wanna do, all glory to God.

42:38.638 --> 42:39.739
Do you solemnly swear

42:39.772 --> 42:41.807
that the evidence you're
presenting today is the truth,

42:41.841 --> 42:44.544
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

42:44.577 --> 42:45.410
I do.

42:45.443 --> 42:46.312
You may have a seat.

42:49.615 --> 42:51.751
State your name for the court.

42:51.783 --> 42:53.752
Reverend Eqwan Taylor.

42:53.785 --> 42:55.787
And where are
you currently residing?

42:55.821 --> 42:57.656
In Los Angeles, California.

42:57.689 --> 43:00.193
I'm the reverend of First
Street Baptist Church.

43:00.225 --> 43:02.394
And where did you
live prior to California?

43:02.428 --> 43:03.530
Right here in Newark.

43:04.497 --> 43:06.566
And were you ever connected

43:06.598 --> 43:08.401
to the defendant, Bernard James?

43:09.901 --> 43:11.303
Yes.
How so?

43:11.970 --> 43:13.305
We were friends.

43:13.339 --> 43:14.374
In fact, isn't it true

43:14.406 --> 43:16.309
that you and Bernard James
were in prison together

43:16.341 --> 43:17.644
for grand larceny?

43:17.676 --> 43:18.544
Yes, sir.

43:20.446 --> 43:23.583
Have you ever heard of
a man name Azugol Kazami?

43:24.917 --> 43:26.252
Yes.

43:26.285 --> 43:27.286
How so?

43:27.319 --> 43:29.888
Bernard and I had
discussed killing Kazami.

43:29.921 --> 43:33.693
Objection, your honor, Mr.
James has never been charged

43:33.725 --> 43:35.761
with the murder of Azugol
Kazami.

43:35.794 --> 43:36.628
A point I'm sure you'll make
clear

43:36.662 --> 43:38.564
in your cross, counselor,
overruled.

43:41.633 --> 43:45.737
So Reverend, in your best
ability,

43:45.771 --> 43:47.973
can you share with us
the conversation you had

43:48.006 --> 43:50.776
regarding the murder of Azugol
Kazami?

43:53.646 --> 43:55.515
Look, what I'm about to put
y'all up on

43:55.548 --> 43:57.816
ain't like shit we ever did
before.

43:57.850 --> 44:00.353
So if y'all ain't bout
it, y'all can bounce.

44:00.385 --> 44:01.553
Man, why you talking
to us like that, Dutch?

44:01.586 --> 44:02.588
You know we down.

44:04.490 --> 44:05.325
Oh yeah?

44:06.691 --> 44:08.727
I'm taking over the drug trade
in Newark.

44:11.263 --> 44:12.097
What the fuck, Dutch?

44:12.131 --> 44:13.765
What you gonna do, compete with
Kazami?

44:13.798 --> 44:14.667
Nah.

44:17.870 --> 44:18.738
We kill Kazami.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.809
Kill Kazami?

44:24.276 --> 44:25.611
I ain't saying you
wrong or nothing, Dutch,

44:25.644 --> 44:28.580
but killing dude, he'd murc us

44:28.613 --> 44:29.982
if he thought we was
thinking about sticking him,

44:30.015 --> 44:31.084
let alone killing him.

44:31.117 --> 44:33.586
We don't know where he
lives or how to get to him.

44:33.618 --> 44:34.787
He's married and got a kid.

44:34.819 --> 44:37.723
Boom, that's how we get to
him.

44:37.756 --> 44:40.559
What, we gonna kidnap
his girl and his kid?

44:40.593 --> 44:41.761
You wanna snatch her?

44:41.794 --> 44:43.663
She know what she signed
up for when she got with him,

44:43.696 --> 44:47.667
but nah, Kazami ain't breaking
his neck over no bitch.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.368
We get her to set him up.

44:49.401 --> 44:51.903
She ain't gonna turn on her
meal ticket.

44:51.937 --> 44:53.373
Sugar Ray will flip her.

44:55.073 --> 44:56.709
That wannabe pimp
motherfucker?

44:56.742 --> 44:58.377
Yeah, Sugar Ray ain't going
for that.

44:58.410 --> 45:00.912
Sugar Ray like money
just like anybody else.

45:00.946 --> 45:02.415
He'll do it for the paper.

45:04.883 --> 45:09.655
Reverend Taylor, Reverend
Taylor, are you all right?

45:10.689 --> 45:12.258
Yes, I'm good, I'm okay.

45:13.892 --> 45:14.860
You need a break?

45:16.062 --> 45:17.764
Yeah, I think I need a moment.

45:18.964 --> 45:21.434
Your honor, short break for my
witness.

45:21.466 --> 45:23.869
This court stands
for a 30 minute recess.

45:38.651 --> 45:40.486
What were we talking about?

45:40.519 --> 45:41.587
Kazami.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.522
Right, right, the African.

45:43.555 --> 45:44.823
Mm-hm.

45:46.959 --> 45:48.595
I don't know about that, man.

45:49.562 --> 45:50.830
It may be too hard.

45:50.863 --> 45:52.464
Come on, man, anybody could
get got.

45:52.497 --> 45:54.766
Yeah, that shit go both ways.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.935
Didn't Kazami get two
hits put out on him?

45:58.903 --> 45:59.938
They missed twice.

46:02.006 --> 46:03.809
What the fuck make you
think we can get him?

46:03.843 --> 46:06.479
Well, that's why we need you,
Sugar Ray.

46:06.511 --> 46:07.814
His broad's the weak link.

46:07.847 --> 46:08.948
They always are.

46:08.981 --> 46:10.950
If anybody can bag him, it's
you.

46:10.982 --> 46:12.751
Now, shit, the mob might miss
twice,

46:12.785 --> 46:14.354
but everybody know Sugar Ray
don't.

46:14.386 --> 46:15.955
You trying to gas me up.

46:15.988 --> 46:19.459
Of course, Sugar, I'm the Sugar
Man, of course I don't miss.

46:22.694 --> 46:24.629
That's to show you we real
about this.

46:24.662 --> 46:27.566
And if you go at Simone and
miss, my word,

46:27.600 --> 46:28.702
my car is yours.

46:38.042 --> 46:39.111
The beamer in front?

46:39.144 --> 46:40.012
Yep.

46:42.046 --> 46:46.685
See, Kazami, he can give
a bitch everything she want

46:47.986 --> 46:49.455
except that understanding.

46:51.490 --> 46:52.658
That's when the Sugar Man come
into play,

46:52.691 --> 46:54.160
you know what I'm saying?

46:54.193 --> 46:57.097
See, I'm the shelter to a bitch
storm.

46:58.664 --> 47:00.399
Gotta create the storm.

47:00.432 --> 47:01.100
The storm?

47:02.133 --> 47:03.735
Like some emotional shit

47:03.769 --> 47:05.738
that Kazami can't buy himself
out of.

47:05.771 --> 47:06.939
Like what?

47:06.972 --> 47:08.941
I don't know, like kill
his bitch daddy or something.

47:08.973 --> 47:09.843
Shit.

47:12.912 --> 47:14.547
We'll be in touch, Sugar Ray.

47:21.653 --> 47:22.789
Be creative.

47:22.821 --> 47:24.890
Ay, you got some panties on?

47:24.923 --> 47:28.193
So Sugar Ray suggested it,

47:28.227 --> 47:30.763
even though he wasn't
serious about you doing it?

47:30.796 --> 47:33.698
Objection, the district
attorney can't possibly expect

47:33.731 --> 47:35.600
the witness to know what
Sugar Ray was thinking.

47:35.633 --> 47:36.769
Sustained.

47:36.801 --> 47:40.439
Reverend Taylor, do you
think Sugar Ray was serious?

47:40.472 --> 47:41.673
Nah.

47:41.707 --> 47:44.410
Do you think the defendant
thought Sugar Ray was serious?

47:45.644 --> 47:46.479
Yes.

47:46.511 --> 47:47.180
How so?

48:02.495 --> 48:04.163
You sure you got this?

48:04.196 --> 48:06.699
I got my killer fit on, I'm
ready.

48:08.133 --> 48:09.033
You know I can do this for
you.

48:09.068 --> 48:11.470
I'm gonna show Dutch, man, I
got this.

48:12.972 --> 48:14.841
All right, let's get it.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.982
The murder of Mr. Smith
not only served as a message

48:24.015 --> 48:26.785
to Kazami but to the rest of the
crew.

48:43.068 --> 48:43.937
No!

49:04.957 --> 49:07.193
The stronger message
was that he was willing

49:07.225 --> 49:09.896
to do anything to get
what he wanted, anything

49:09.928 --> 49:14.733
and just like Sugar Ray
said, Simone fell apart.

49:17.769 --> 49:21.239
Whoa, slow down,
slow down.

49:21.272 --> 49:22.541
You don't know what it's like,
Ray.

49:22.575 --> 49:25.278
I do know how it is to be with
a man

49:25.310 --> 49:27.146
that don't protect you from your
enemies.

49:27.178 --> 49:28.981
You know he's using all the
time.

49:29.881 --> 49:31.117
We got a child in the house.

49:31.149 --> 49:33.151
Baby, that's just to cure his
soul

49:33.185 --> 49:35.621
from the guilt he's consumed
with.

49:35.653 --> 49:39.724
Let me tell you something,
his days of reckoning,

49:39.758 --> 49:40.792
oh, they coming.

49:40.825 --> 49:43.094
Yeah, but how long are
we gonna have to wait for?

49:43.127 --> 49:45.832
Kazami makes my skin crawl
every time he touches me.

49:46.566 --> 49:49.669
You know, I wouldn't be able to
see you

49:49.702 --> 49:51.604
if he didn't let me come and
work out.

49:52.671 --> 49:54.040
I can't take this no more.

49:54.073 --> 49:57.676
Baby, I'm the Sugar
Man, that's why I'm here

49:57.709 --> 50:00.713
to protect you, make sure
your financial resources

50:00.745 --> 50:04.182
is all together for the rest of
your life

50:04.216 --> 50:05.918
for you and your family,

50:05.950 --> 50:09.789
but you gotta trust me,
you gotta believe me.

50:09.821 --> 50:11.124
Can you do that for me?

50:12.992 --> 50:15.160
I'll do anything you want,
Ray.

50:15.193 --> 50:17.062
You just gotta help me with my
needs.

50:18.796 --> 50:19.865
Oh, most definitely.

50:22.334 --> 50:24.669
Ay, bring some champagne.

50:24.702 --> 50:26.104
We celebrating over here, man.

50:27.906 --> 50:29.208
I don't think you will
get an argument from anyone

50:29.240 --> 50:31.209
if you decided to quit.

50:31.243 --> 50:32.244
Or you can call a priest

50:32.276 --> 50:33.713
and y'all can discuss your
future.

50:33.745 --> 50:35.146
You do know regardless of what
we do,

50:35.180 --> 50:36.716
there's no chance of us winning.

50:36.749 --> 50:37.684
It's problematic for me

50:37.716 --> 50:40.086
when my client sides with the
prosecution.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.222
I make no excuses for who I
am.

50:46.191 --> 50:48.227
We covet what we see first.

50:48.260 --> 50:49.227
Where I grew up,

50:49.260 --> 50:51.296
being a drug dealer's
how you make your money.

50:51.330 --> 50:53.833
You get one time to be big time.

50:53.865 --> 50:55.400
Great argument, but
it's not gonna stop you

50:55.434 --> 50:57.202
from getting the lethal
injection.

51:11.216 --> 51:12.952
I wanna talk to you about the
deal.

51:14.019 --> 51:16.287
Y'all needed me to crack a
bitch.

51:16.321 --> 51:17.990
You know me, I crack five
bitches

51:18.022 --> 51:19.290
like I crack five knuckles,

51:19.323 --> 51:21.026
you know what I'm saying and
ball my fist.

51:22.894 --> 51:26.832
So it's only right,
50/50 split, 50/50 deal.

51:29.834 --> 51:31.269
I hear what you saying.

51:31.303 --> 51:32.338
I mean, we did call you.

51:32.370 --> 51:35.273
So I'm cool with a 50/50
split under one condition.

51:37.176 --> 51:39.078
Conditions?

51:39.111 --> 51:40.113
You come with us.

51:40.812 --> 51:42.682
I mean, 'cause we could look and
come back

51:42.714 --> 51:43.948
and tell you anything.

51:43.981 --> 51:45.117
Now, if you feel shitted on,

51:45.149 --> 51:47.119
that could ruin a beautiful
partnership.

51:51.222 --> 51:52.891
I ain't got a problem with
that.

51:52.925 --> 51:54.260
So can we get to business?

51:58.129 --> 52:00.198
I got two one-way tickets to
Miami.

52:00.231 --> 52:03.101
She wants to go together
after all this shit go down.

52:03.135 --> 52:04.069
You know what I mean, but you
know me.

52:04.102 --> 52:05.271
I roll alone.

52:05.303 --> 52:06.238
Now, Kazami, if he don't trust
the bitch,

52:06.272 --> 52:08.874
what the fuck I look
like trusting the bitch?

52:08.906 --> 52:09.807
You know what I'm saying?

52:09.841 --> 52:11.209
So I feel like her and Kazambi
should go

52:11.243 --> 52:12.912
on the trip together without me.

52:14.412 --> 52:16.748
Far as the crib, he don't
really keep no real money

52:16.781 --> 52:17.716
in there, you know what I mean?

52:17.749 --> 52:20.985
I mean, she's sprung but he
ain't no fool.

52:21.019 --> 52:22.187
You know what I mean?

52:22.220 --> 52:24.756
He got two trap houses, one
in Newark, one in Elizabeth.

52:24.789 --> 52:26.391
Oh, we got that covered.

52:27.959 --> 52:32.030
The main house in
Roselle, high security,

52:32.064 --> 52:34.200
500 thou on them, Simone
gonna have that packed

52:34.232 --> 52:35.834
in the kitchen waiting for us.

52:37.068 --> 52:37.836
You know what I'm saying?

52:37.870 --> 52:39.739
We gonna go as satellite
repairmen.

52:40.673 --> 52:43.910
Only problem is we can't bring
our straps.

52:44.877 --> 52:47.280
But Simone will have
two guns waiting for us.

52:48.379 --> 52:50.348
So we're going in unarmed,

52:50.381 --> 52:52.283
depending on some chick to gun
us.

52:52.316 --> 52:54.185
I ain't feeling that.

52:54.218 --> 52:55.421
It's the only way, you
know what I'm saying?

52:55.453 --> 52:57.756
You think I wanna go in
there without my heat?

52:58.823 --> 53:01.493
It works for me as long
as that kid ain't there.

53:01.526 --> 53:03.928
Nothing to it, I swear
to God, I'll make her take

53:03.961 --> 53:05.530
that little bastard to her
grandparents.

53:05.564 --> 53:07.934
So we good, let's get it done.

53:31.557 --> 53:33.225
We're here to repair the
satellite.

53:33.258 --> 53:35.194
It's inside, but I
gotta check you first.

53:36.461 --> 53:38.765
Shit, now we committing a
crime?

53:45.102 --> 53:46.872
Can I get my tools?

54:08.227 --> 54:09.562
Hi, I'm Simone.

54:10.428 --> 54:11.530
Nice to meet you.

54:12.597 --> 54:13.365
Do you think you could show us

54:13.399 --> 54:15.034
where your primary box is,
please?

54:15.066 --> 54:17.235
Yeah, right this way.

54:31.350 --> 54:33.052
Who the fuck is this?

54:33.084 --> 54:34.919
They're here to fix the
satellite

54:34.952 --> 54:37.021
and you said you weren't
doing that anymore.

54:37.055 --> 54:38.890
What's the point of
sending a boat to your mom

54:38.923 --> 54:40.292
if I can't enjoy myself?

54:42.627 --> 54:44.463
It's cool, I fixed them
already.

54:50.234 --> 54:51.570
Right this way.

54:53.238 --> 54:56.876
Hey!

54:56.908 --> 54:57.843
Wanna ball?

54:59.010 --> 55:00.945
We working, man.

55:32.010 --> 55:32.645
You ready?

55:32.678 --> 55:33.546
Let's do it.

56:06.211 --> 56:08.080
Babe, do you have a minute?

56:08.113 --> 56:09.315
Please, please.

56:17.356 --> 56:20.158
Come on, you never dance with
me.

56:35.073 --> 56:35.942
It's clear.

56:52.423 --> 56:54.126
Yo, yo, yo, drop the fucking
gun.

56:54.158 --> 56:55.026
Son of a!

56:57.428 --> 56:58.497
Put it on the table.

57:03.035 --> 57:05.071
Now face the fucking wall on
your knees.

57:08.673 --> 57:09.774
We gonna keep this real simple.

57:09.807 --> 57:10.876
We here for the money.

57:10.908 --> 57:13.144
Now, if it's where it's
supposed to be at, we good.

57:13.178 --> 57:15.513
If it ain't, I'm blowing
her fucking brains out.

57:32.363 --> 57:36.068
I got the baby, bro, let's get
it.

57:36.100 --> 57:37.303
Okay.

57:49.414 --> 57:51.050
Are we good?

57:51.082 --> 57:52.483
Yeah, damn right, we good.

57:52.517 --> 57:54.086
Told you.

57:54.118 --> 57:56.055
Yeah, we got your kid.

57:56.088 --> 57:56.756
It's over.

58:00.725 --> 58:02.328
I have no further questions.

58:05.196 --> 58:06.798
Your witness, Ms.
Nichols.

58:08.300 --> 58:09.767
I should cross examine him.

58:09.801 --> 58:10.669
Yeah.

58:13.305 --> 58:15.274
Defense has no questions, your
honor.

58:21.146 --> 58:25.117
Hey, Craze , what is it with you?

58:25.149 --> 58:26.350
Why the stone face?

58:27.318 --> 58:28.152
Shh.

58:28.187 --> 58:30.189
You did have a problem with
Kazami,

58:30.222 --> 58:31.557
but you ain't got that problem
no more.

58:31.589 --> 58:32.490
What?

58:33.624 --> 58:35.393
Whoa.

58:35.426 --> 58:37.261
Now I know why they call you
Craze.

58:37.294 --> 58:39.597
What are you a fucking
psycho walking around

58:39.631 --> 58:41.634
with this fucking head in this
bag?

58:42.468 --> 58:44.470
Your man, Lil Frankie right
here,

58:45.836 --> 58:47.605
yeah, he couldn't finish the
job.

58:47.638 --> 58:49.307
So we did it as a favor.

58:50.075 --> 58:51.843
Roberto, what is it
with these fucking kids?

58:51.877 --> 58:54.313
Here, here, get rid of this
shit.

58:54.345 --> 58:57.515
Get rid of that, just
get it out of here.

58:57.548 --> 59:00.251
I gotta admit, though, you
know what?

59:00.285 --> 59:03.222
This fucking Kazami's been a
thorn in my side for years.

59:03.254 --> 59:06.591
You got a guy we've been
trying real hard to get.

59:06.624 --> 59:09.894
So for that, I guess we owe you
a favor

59:09.928 --> 59:13.632
and I think I know what that
favor is.

59:13.664 --> 59:16.834
I think you guys wanna take
over the drug trade, right?

59:16.868 --> 59:19.671
And you need us to
provide police protection,

59:19.703 --> 59:21.573
so you could be bosses.

59:21.606 --> 59:24.209
Is that the long and the short
of it?

59:24.242 --> 59:26.644
And you got yourself a friend,
believe me,

59:26.678 --> 59:28.747
as long as you live.

59:28.780 --> 59:29.682
Smile, will you?

59:30.515 --> 59:32.350
You want me to call Detective
O'Neal?

59:32.383 --> 59:33.284
That's a good idea,

59:33.318 --> 59:34.519
tell him they're with us now,
all right.

59:34.553 --> 59:35.354
Come on, let's go munch.

59:35.386 --> 59:37.689
Whoa, whoa, I got something to
say.

59:38.624 --> 59:40.526
I'd take a bullet for the
both of yous right now,

59:40.559 --> 59:42.194
you know that.

59:42.227 --> 59:43.729
I don't trust these mulignans.

59:43.761 --> 59:45.930
They're animals, they speak a
language

59:45.964 --> 59:48.333
I don't even know what the
fuck they're talking about.

59:48.365 --> 59:50.434
And that head in a duffel bag,

59:50.468 --> 59:52.538
it's gonna come back
to bite us in the ass.

59:52.571 --> 59:53.772
And let me tell you something
right now.

59:53.805 --> 59:55.773
I'm going on record with you,
Tony, I am not taking a fall

59:55.807 --> 59:56.975
for these fucking niggers.

59:57.008 --> 59:59.611
And I'll wack the both of them
right now, it's what I do.

59:59.644 --> 1:00:01.479
Do I fucking stutter when I
talk, heh?

1:00:01.513 --> 1:00:02.347
Did you not just hear me?

1:00:02.381 --> 1:00:04.783
Did you not hear me give him my
word,

1:00:04.816 --> 1:00:06.350
you know what my fucking word
is?

1:00:06.383 --> 1:00:07.584
But what is it with you, heh?

1:00:07.618 --> 1:00:10.222
Smarten up, all right, stop
being so fucking color blind.

1:00:10.254 --> 1:00:11.323
Change with the times.

1:00:11.356 --> 1:00:13.524
I know where we can get
some good veal and peppers.

1:00:13.557 --> 1:00:15.593
Oh, look at this, what is
this Mount Everest here?

1:00:15.627 --> 1:00:16.728
Jesus Christ.

1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:17.929
Holy shit!

1:00:19.430 --> 1:00:20.499
Who hired this kid?

1:00:33.245 --> 1:00:36.515
We should take a vote,
you know, to gauge things.

1:00:36.548 --> 1:00:38.316
That's against the rules.

1:00:38.350 --> 1:00:39.751
Yeah, but save a lot of time

1:00:39.783 --> 1:00:41.419
once you get into deliberation.

1:00:42.687 --> 1:00:45.624
I'm sorry this process
is inconveniencing you,

1:00:45.656 --> 1:00:47.825
but we haven't heard everything
yet.

1:00:47.859 --> 1:00:50.629
I've heard enough, that boy is
guilty.

1:00:50.662 --> 1:00:51.897
Don't y'all feel the same?

1:00:52.696 --> 1:00:55.600
Anybody don't feel the way
Henry does?

1:00:55.633 --> 1:00:58.302
Don't get me wrong, I think
he's guilty

1:00:58.336 --> 1:01:02.540
of a lot of things, just not
what he's being charged with.

1:01:02.573 --> 1:01:05.543
I like his lawyer, I wanna
hear what she has to say.

1:01:50.055 --> 1:01:50.923
Yay!

1:01:54.825 --> 1:01:55.693
There she go.

1:01:55.727 --> 1:01:57.562
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

1:02:02.966 --> 1:02:04.602
What's up, birthday girl?

1:02:04.635 --> 1:02:06.971
Look at the birthday girl.

1:02:07.004 --> 1:02:08.506
Hi.

1:02:08.539 --> 1:02:09.641
Go ahead, make a wish.

1:02:16.548 --> 1:02:17.982
These are Angel's Charlies.

1:02:18.015 --> 1:02:19.483
They're down for whatever.

1:02:19.517 --> 1:02:21.620
Oh yeah, let's get down to the
whatever.

1:02:21.653 --> 1:02:23.589
Wait, wait, wait, glasses,
glasses.

1:02:24.656 --> 1:02:25.857
For sure.

1:02:25.890 --> 1:02:28.059
Everyone, now look, in the
seven years I've been released

1:02:28.093 --> 1:02:29.728
from prison, we've been more
successful

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.829
than most motherfuckers do in a
lifetime.

1:02:32.564 --> 1:02:34.966
Now, I'm not just talking
about the street oglers.

1:02:34.999 --> 1:02:37.535
The entertainment, the
fashion, the restaurants,

1:02:37.568 --> 1:02:40.004
like this one here, Mr.
Cerrone's blessed me with.

1:02:40.772 --> 1:02:43.375
Angel has been instrumental in
all of it.

1:02:44.575 --> 1:02:46.510
Now, this is Angel's night,

1:02:46.544 --> 1:02:50.848
but none of this could've
happened without all of you.

1:02:50.881 --> 1:02:53.551
You're my brothers, you're my
sister

1:02:53.584 --> 1:02:55.386
and I owe all you motherfuckers.

1:02:56.653 --> 1:02:57.655
- Family.
- Family.

1:03:00.892 --> 1:03:02.727
Now let's get to the
everything.

1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:03.795
Come on, Dutch, let's take a
picture.

1:03:03.828 --> 1:03:05.763
Oh, you know I don't
like being in no pictures.

1:03:05.796 --> 1:03:07.131
Come on, just one.

1:03:07.164 --> 1:03:08.466
Come on, I'll take it.

1:03:10.769 --> 1:03:11.970
Come on, Dutch.

1:03:17.075 --> 1:03:18.743
Ay, how was that party?

1:03:20.412 --> 1:03:21.747
Fire.

1:03:21.780 --> 1:03:22.714
It was lit.

1:03:22.747 --> 1:03:25.117
Lit, Angel brought
out all the bad bitches.

1:03:25.149 --> 1:03:25.983
All of them.

1:03:26.017 --> 1:03:26.984
All of them.

1:03:27.017 --> 1:03:29.053
Man, the traffic on
the highway was so bad,

1:03:29.086 --> 1:03:31.922
I ain't going up to Bmore no
time soon.

1:03:31.955 --> 1:03:34.526
Shut yo ass up, if it
wasn't for them crab cakes

1:03:34.559 --> 1:03:36.595
you ordered, we would've
been there on time.

1:03:36.627 --> 1:03:37.595
Uh, there go the truth.

1:03:37.629 --> 1:03:39.664
Man, I wasn't the only
one eating crab cakes.

1:03:39.696 --> 1:03:41.867
You had crab cakes, too.

1:03:41.899 --> 1:03:43.602
You know she expect the
whole family to be there.

1:03:43.635 --> 1:03:45.636
She gonna kick your ass.

1:03:47.638 --> 1:03:50.107
Hey, fellas, what's happening?

1:03:50.140 --> 1:03:51.008
Where's Dutch?

1:03:53.510 --> 1:03:54.746
Roc, let me talk to you.

1:04:01.019 --> 1:04:03.888
You know what one of
the most dangerous parts

1:04:03.921 --> 1:04:05.490
of our business is?

1:04:06.158 --> 1:04:08.527
It's not aiming too high that
you miss it,

1:04:09.861 --> 1:04:11.797
it's aiming too low that you
reach it.

1:04:12.897 --> 1:04:16.135
Buona fortuna, lots of good
fortune.

1:04:17.669 --> 1:04:19.703
I wanna make you rich.

1:04:19.736 --> 1:04:22.773
I want you to come with me
and be part of my family.

1:04:22.807 --> 1:04:27.812
Dutch, he's nothing
without me, he's washed up.

1:04:28.146 --> 1:04:30.481
What, Dutch, that's my
brother.

1:04:30.515 --> 1:04:31.783
We been down for life.

1:04:32.850 --> 1:04:34.787
Loyalty, you feel me?

1:04:35.854 --> 1:04:38.089
Loyalty, I love that.

1:04:39.723 --> 1:04:43.995
I just hope that Dutch cares
about your little clique

1:04:44.028 --> 1:04:45.430
just as much as you do.

1:04:47.499 --> 1:04:48.167
Do you feel me?

1:04:56.039 --> 1:04:57.008
Think about it.

1:05:02.814 --> 1:05:04.516
I don't trust them Italians.

1:05:05.517 --> 1:05:07.719
Dutch think Frank had something
to do with that stolen car

1:05:07.752 --> 1:05:09.188
that y'all got locked up in.

1:05:10.722 --> 1:05:11.756
I know what Dutch think,

1:05:11.789 --> 1:05:14.058
but I don't think they
had nothing to do with it.

1:05:14.091 --> 1:05:16.060
But Dutch is always on point,
so...

1:05:18.863 --> 1:05:21.566
Fake ass Tony Montana
Italians.

1:05:23.734 --> 1:05:25.937
That nigga said Tony Montana.

1:05:25.970 --> 1:05:27.973
At this juncture, the
prosecutor has painted

1:05:28.006 --> 1:05:31.176
an incredibly unflattering
picture of you to the jury.

1:05:31.209 --> 1:05:33.245
Now mind you, it has
nothing to do with the case

1:05:33.278 --> 1:05:35.080
and I'll cover it in my closing,

1:05:35.113 --> 1:05:37.281
but we have to put on a
defense and we'd be idiots

1:05:37.314 --> 1:05:39.850
to think that we can unring that
bell.

1:05:39.883 --> 1:05:41.519
And we not idiots?

1:05:41.553 --> 1:05:43.922
I go out of my way not
to look like an idiot.

1:05:43.955 --> 1:05:46.258
So it would be good for you
to have someone speak well

1:05:46.290 --> 1:05:47.926
on your behalf.

1:05:47.959 --> 1:05:50.828
If not, change the perception
that Jacobs has presented

1:05:50.861 --> 1:05:53.097
but at least question it.

1:05:53.964 --> 1:05:54.832
Right.

1:06:02.106 --> 1:06:05.209
Is there anyone that can
say good things about you?

1:06:05.243 --> 1:06:08.080
Dozens, but they're all dead
or in jail.

1:06:09.781 --> 1:06:10.749
That's not good.

1:06:11.582 --> 1:06:15.854
No childhood friends, impartial
third parties, girlfriends?

1:06:16.787 --> 1:06:17.789
No.

1:06:17.823 --> 1:06:20.025
No significant
other of any kind?

1:06:20.758 --> 1:06:23.894
In my lifetime, Ms. Nichols,
I've had my share of women,

1:06:23.928 --> 1:06:26.196
but no, I've never been in a
relationship.

1:06:26.229 --> 1:06:27.899
- No?
- No.

1:06:32.102 --> 1:06:34.271
Jacobs won't be done with
putting on his witnesses

1:06:34.305 --> 1:06:37.309
until the middle of next
week, so give it some thought.

1:06:38.276 --> 1:06:39.344
Thank you.

1:06:39.377 --> 1:06:41.547
Sure, I'll see you tomorrow.

1:06:42.914 --> 1:06:43.781
Yeah.

1:06:45.082 --> 1:06:47.051
Dutch, hey, come on over here.

1:06:47.084 --> 1:06:49.153
Ladies, this is the owner.

1:06:49.187 --> 1:06:50.221
- Hi.
- Hey.

1:06:50.254 --> 1:06:51.089
Give us a minute.

1:06:51.122 --> 1:06:51.990
Have a seat.

1:06:55.059 --> 1:06:56.961
I love what you did to this
place.

1:06:56.995 --> 1:06:57.896
Thanks.

1:06:57.930 --> 1:06:59.931
But I have been hearing some
rumblings.

1:06:59.964 --> 1:07:01.900
Yeah, what sort of rumblings?

1:07:01.932 --> 1:07:05.102
Frank thinks that the
restaurant should be given

1:07:05.135 --> 1:07:06.338
to someone in the family.

1:07:07.138 --> 1:07:09.641
Well, I'm like family with Mr.
Cerrone.

1:07:09.673 --> 1:07:13.010
So Frank could go see him
if he has a problem with it.

1:07:13.044 --> 1:07:15.113
I don't have a horse in this
race.

1:07:15.146 --> 1:07:17.281
I just wish you should
give me a little something.

1:07:18.082 --> 1:07:20.151
Yeah, yeah, I'll cop
you a bottle of champagne.

1:07:20.184 --> 1:07:21.017
What kind you drink?

1:07:21.051 --> 1:07:24.055
That's not what I'm talking
about.

1:07:25.189 --> 1:07:28.193
You know what I'm talking about.

1:07:28.225 --> 1:07:31.229
Give me a little info
on one of your rivals,

1:07:31.261 --> 1:07:33.030
it'll make me look good.

1:07:33.064 --> 1:07:36.033
Yeah, well I don't snitch
on anyone, anywhere, anytime

1:07:36.066 --> 1:07:37.702
or under any circumstance.

1:07:39.037 --> 1:07:40.672
You might wanna rethink that.

1:07:42.406 --> 1:07:44.977
Just did, the answer's still
no.

1:07:45.943 --> 1:07:46.812
You take care.

1:07:54.051 --> 1:07:55.287
Y'all went, what?

1:08:00.390 --> 1:08:02.793
I got one and a pimp.

1:08:03.627 --> 1:08:07.832
Hello, nuh-uh, Tamika, no,
no not today, okay, girl.

1:08:07.865 --> 1:08:09.100
I have money on this game.

1:08:09.868 --> 1:08:13.304
And you over there eye
fucking dude, Tamika.

1:08:13.336 --> 1:08:14.372
I'll be right back.

1:08:16.274 --> 1:08:17.142
There she go.

1:08:20.778 --> 1:08:22.312
Come on, Nina, you gonna pay or
play?

1:08:22.346 --> 1:08:23.415
I ain't got all day.

1:08:23.448 --> 1:08:25.115
How am I gonna play?

1:08:25.149 --> 1:08:27.252
I mean, you see my partner ran
off hoeing.

1:08:31.756 --> 1:08:33.223
I could play.

1:08:33.257 --> 1:08:34.192
Come again?

1:08:34.225 --> 1:08:36.662
I can play until your
partner comes back.

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:38.296
What's up, boss?

1:08:42.065 --> 1:08:44.035
Sure, if he's forfeiting.

1:08:49.406 --> 1:08:52.444
So I got five and a possible.

1:08:52.476 --> 1:08:53.811
What you got?

1:08:53.845 --> 1:08:54.945
I'm sorry, excuse me?

1:08:57.114 --> 1:08:58.382
How many do you have?

1:09:01.084 --> 1:09:02.953
Oh, yeah, I got two.

1:09:05.757 --> 1:09:06.925
Put us down for eight.

1:09:07.659 --> 1:09:10.429
Eight out the gate,
somebody's feeling lucky.

1:09:13.864 --> 1:09:16.734
Thank you, nice doing business
with you.

1:09:22.272 --> 1:09:23.141
Seriously?

1:09:25.443 --> 1:09:27.912
Didn't you just see me play all
hearts?

1:09:27.945 --> 1:09:29.481
I thought you said you could
play.

1:09:31.149 --> 1:09:32.017
My fault.

1:09:34.217 --> 1:09:36.821
It's been fun, but I have to
go.

1:09:38.455 --> 1:09:39.757
Stop, come on, Nina.

1:09:43.461 --> 1:09:45.363
Yo, how much she lose?

1:09:45.395 --> 1:09:46.263
500.

1:09:49.266 --> 1:09:49.900
I don't know where he is.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:50.901
I don't wanna fucking wait.

1:09:50.936 --> 1:09:52.403
What are we, a couple
of jerk offs over here

1:09:52.436 --> 1:09:53.537
- waiting for...
- There he is.

1:09:53.570 --> 1:09:56.774
Hey, it's the fucking Ly
brothers, Hugly and Ugly.

1:09:56.807 --> 1:09:59.077
Ha-ha, funny, come on, let's
go.

1:09:59.110 --> 1:10:01.312
I went to see Dutch like you
sent me.

1:10:01.345 --> 1:10:03.515
Yeah, he hands me a bag of
money.

1:10:03.547 --> 1:10:04.481
I said, what's this?

1:10:04.515 --> 1:10:05.784
He says it's a start.

1:10:05.816 --> 1:10:07.017
A start, I say.

1:10:07.052 --> 1:10:09.487
Let me tell you something, you
stupid black son of a bitch,

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:11.055
you know what your problem is?

1:10:11.087 --> 1:10:13.190
You took what another man
earned.

1:10:13.223 --> 1:10:14.359
You tried to build your
foundation

1:10:14.391 --> 1:10:15.926
on another man's reputation.

1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:20.198
I told them this, you forgot
the one thing in our business.

1:10:20.230 --> 1:10:22.800
You live and die on you and you
alone.

1:10:22.833 --> 1:10:24.903
I mean, sure I know he's
crazy, a little more ruthless,

1:10:24.936 --> 1:10:27.272
he had to be, I'll give him
that, okay.

1:10:27.305 --> 1:10:28.439
But he plays by his own rules.

1:10:28.471 --> 1:10:30.474
He doesn't play by our rules.

1:10:30.507 --> 1:10:32.209
He pisses me off.

1:10:32.243 --> 1:10:36.047
So then I told him, now
I got you by the balls.

1:10:36.079 --> 1:10:38.182
And I'm gonna keep squeezing and
squeezing

1:10:38.216 --> 1:10:39.484
until I get fucking blood.

1:10:39.516 --> 1:10:41.051
And then I'm gonna crush you

1:10:41.084 --> 1:10:43.221
like the piss ass nigger that
you are.

1:10:43.253 --> 1:10:44.388
And he just stands there, he
looks at me,

1:10:44.422 --> 1:10:46.223
he doesn't say anything, he's a
chump.

1:10:46.257 --> 1:10:47.525
You done?

1:10:47.557 --> 1:10:48.359
Yeah.

1:10:48.391 --> 1:10:49.526
What is your fucking problem,
huh?

1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.596
Those guys make us a ton of
fucking dough, all right.

1:10:51.628 --> 1:10:54.531
Nobody's gonna connect them
to us, so just re-fucking-lax

1:10:54.565 --> 1:10:55.700
and forget about it.

1:10:55.732 --> 1:10:57.869
It's a lot of fucking money
and it goes in my pocket.

1:10:57.901 --> 1:10:59.037
What's your fucking problem,
huh?

1:10:59.070 --> 1:10:59.904
What the fuck is your problem?

1:10:59.937 --> 1:11:00.739
You're my fucking
problem!

1:11:00.771 --> 1:11:01.439
- Fuck you!
- All right, all right.

1:11:01.472 --> 1:11:02.140
, all right.

1:11:02.172 --> 1:11:05.108
That's it, finito, all right.

1:11:05.141 --> 1:11:06.543
If this keeps up, we're gonna
sit down

1:11:06.577 --> 1:11:09.513
with the old man, all right.

1:11:09.547 --> 1:11:11.382
You're gonna get slapped on the
wrist, maybe more than that,

1:11:11.414 --> 1:11:12.382
all right, Frank?

1:11:12.415 --> 1:11:14.185
You ain't going to see
him again, all right.

1:11:14.217 --> 1:11:15.485
You don't deal with them anymore

1:11:15.519 --> 1:11:17.922
because I can't fucking trust
you.

1:11:17.954 --> 1:11:20.057
Hey, I'm talking to
you all right, capiche?

1:11:20.757 --> 1:11:23.093
, enough,
now come on, let's go.

1:11:23.127 --> 1:11:25.029
You're gonna fuck this up for
us!

1:11:25.061 --> 1:11:26.296
All right, stop, stop!

1:11:26.329 --> 1:11:28.131
Stop,

1:11:28.164 --> 1:11:28.966
I'm not riding with him.

1:11:28.998 --> 1:11:30.868
I'll ride in my own car, fuck
it.

1:11:33.971 --> 1:11:37.441
Hey, Roc, ain't Aisha supposed
to be having the baby soon?

1:11:37.475 --> 1:11:38.510
Yeah, any day.

1:11:39.610 --> 1:11:44.982
Ay, ain't that about your
fourth, fifth baby with Aisha?

1:11:45.016 --> 1:11:46.284
You need to get your tubes tied.

1:11:46.316 --> 1:11:48.086
Shut up, nigga.

1:11:48.119 --> 1:11:48.953
What's up, baby girl?

1:11:48.985 --> 1:11:50.988
Hi, where's Dutch?

1:11:51.021 --> 1:11:53.190
I got somebody who wants to talk
to him.

1:11:53.223 --> 1:11:54.492
Who?

1:11:54.525 --> 1:11:56.394
William Brent.

1:11:56.427 --> 1:11:57.896
And who the fuck is that?

1:11:57.928 --> 1:11:58.596
Bill Blass.

1:11:59.997 --> 1:12:01.499
What he want?

1:12:01.531 --> 1:12:02.400
Trabajo?

1:12:05.669 --> 1:12:07.939
All right, fuck it, send him
in.

1:12:07.971 --> 1:12:08.639
Yo!

1:12:11.542 --> 1:12:13.444
Oh, there he is.

1:12:13.476 --> 1:12:15.346
What's up, Bill, go on have a
seat.

1:12:16.713 --> 1:12:17.948
What's going on, man?

1:12:18.748 --> 1:12:23.520
Hey, guys, I really hate that
I'm here

1:12:23.553 --> 1:12:27.958
but my family and I are really
down on our luck right now.

1:12:29.025 --> 1:12:34.131
And I'm just looking for
any type of work right now

1:12:34.164 --> 1:12:34.999
if you have any.

1:12:36.232 --> 1:12:38.535
All right, what you think,
Roc?

1:12:40.137 --> 1:12:41.106
Give us a minute.

1:12:42.272 --> 1:12:47.279
All right.

1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:50.548
Who he fuck with?

1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:51.917
Joe from Newark.

1:12:53.217 --> 1:12:54.619
He on the run from the feds.

1:12:57.120 --> 1:12:58.489
Man, fuck it.

1:12:58.521 --> 1:13:00.190
Just have him take Bliss' spot.

1:13:01.257 --> 1:13:02.126
Yeah.

1:13:02.961 --> 1:13:04.729
All right, let's
move, let's make it happen.

1:13:04.762 --> 1:13:06.397
Let's make it happen, let's
move.

1:13:06.430 --> 1:13:07.263
- All right.
- All right.

1:13:07.297 --> 1:13:10.400
On another note, nigga, is you
sterile?

1:13:10.434 --> 1:13:12.070
'Cause you ain't got no kids.

1:13:12.102 --> 1:13:13.038
Fuck you.

1:13:18.775 --> 1:13:20.510
Susan said you
wanted to see me, sir.

1:13:20.543 --> 1:13:21.511
Nina, come in.

1:13:21.544 --> 1:13:23.347
I wanted to introduce
you to our new client

1:13:23.381 --> 1:13:25.383
I was telling you about, Mr.
James.

1:13:25.415 --> 1:13:26.284
Mr. James.

1:13:27.418 --> 1:13:29.220
You can call me Bernard.

1:13:30.087 --> 1:13:31.522
I'm sorry, I've gotta take
this.

1:13:31.555 --> 1:13:34.191
You guys keep talking, I'll be
right back.

1:13:37.395 --> 1:13:39.397
I thought your name was Dutch.

1:13:39.430 --> 1:13:40.397
Nickname.

1:13:40.431 --> 1:13:43.201
So how do you
get Dutch from Bernard?

1:13:43.234 --> 1:13:44.235
It's a long story.

1:13:45.369 --> 1:13:46.704
So the Cerrone Social Club is
one

1:13:46.736 --> 1:13:48.506
of the six restaurants that you
own?

1:13:48.538 --> 1:13:50.742
No, but I manage it for a
friend.

1:13:50.775 --> 1:13:53.311
You're not exactly the person
you pretend to be, are you?

1:13:53.343 --> 1:13:54.544
Look, I said I could play
cards

1:13:54.578 --> 1:13:55.513
till your friend came back.

1:13:55.546 --> 1:13:57.147
I didn't say I was good at it.

1:13:58.248 --> 1:13:59.383
Nice, go ahead.

1:13:59.417 --> 1:14:01.718
One, two, head body, head
body, there you go, come on.

1:14:01.752 --> 1:14:03.654
Come on, come on.

1:14:03.686 --> 1:14:04.588
Body, body.

1:14:04.622 --> 1:14:05.522
There you go, hit it, hit it...

1:14:05.556 --> 1:14:07.557
Don't listen to him, he don't
know shit.

1:14:07.591 --> 1:14:09.293
Oh, Tony, veni ca.

1:14:09.325 --> 1:14:10.293
Hey.

1:14:10.327 --> 1:14:11.262
Kid looks good.

1:14:11.294 --> 1:14:13.096
He does, you'll
fuck that up.

1:14:13.129 --> 1:14:14.464
I trained him myself.

1:14:14.498 --> 1:14:16.200
I could see that.

1:14:16.232 --> 1:14:18.302
Thank you for coming
down here to sit with me.

1:14:18.334 --> 1:14:21.105
No problem, for reasons
passed understanding,

1:14:21.137 --> 1:14:23.207
I'm out picking up a few
things for the old lady

1:14:23.239 --> 1:14:25.376
tomorrow being our wedding
anniversary.

1:14:25.409 --> 1:14:28.112
Buona fortuna, did your wife
get the flowers I sent her?

1:14:28.145 --> 1:14:30.415
Yes, by the way, that was
an incredibly nice gesture.

1:14:30.448 --> 1:14:32.417
You made me look bad, you fuck.

1:14:35.386 --> 1:14:37.555
I didn't think it was
appropriate

1:14:37.587 --> 1:14:40.090
to talk to you about this over
the phone.

1:14:40.123 --> 1:14:41.591
What are we talking about?

1:14:41.624 --> 1:14:44.494
I'm talking about our
street holdings here.

1:14:44.528 --> 1:14:45.363
Dutch?

1:14:45.395 --> 1:14:47.197
Yeah, Dutch.

1:14:47.230 --> 1:14:49.166
Come on, we all know these
people are inferior to us.

1:14:49.199 --> 1:14:50.600
Things ain't being ran right.

1:14:50.633 --> 1:14:53.404
No, no, things are being
ran very fucking right

1:14:53.436 --> 1:14:54.805
from where I'm sitting.

1:14:54.838 --> 1:14:57.641
And the reason I know this
is my accountant told me so.

1:14:58.376 --> 1:15:00.378
And just so there's no
more fucking confusion

1:15:00.410 --> 1:15:02.245
about where I'm sitting on this,

1:15:02.279 --> 1:15:03.647
the next time you wanna get
ahold of me,

1:15:03.681 --> 1:15:05.683
you call me on a fucking phone.

1:15:08.519 --> 1:15:09.587
You mean you're gonna take the
side

1:15:09.619 --> 1:15:12.623
of that bottom feeding
nigger over one of your own?

1:15:23.601 --> 1:15:24.502
Nice work, Lou.

1:15:26.736 --> 1:15:28.739
That's it, head body, head body.

1:15:28.771 --> 1:15:30.607
Come on, keep up that footwork.

1:15:35.145 --> 1:15:36.580
You come here a lot?

1:15:36.614 --> 1:15:37.848
A few times, a lot of doctors,

1:15:37.882 --> 1:15:40.184
lawyers and financial analysts
come here.

1:15:40.217 --> 1:15:43.154
I get it, rich people like
to hang with rich people.

1:15:43.186 --> 1:15:43.854
Well, I ain't gonna lie.

1:15:43.887 --> 1:15:46.189
I enjoy the harvest of my labor.

1:15:46.222 --> 1:15:48.225
But to be honest, all this is a
result

1:15:48.258 --> 1:15:49.694
of wanting it for someone else.

1:15:50.727 --> 1:15:52.363
Okay, I'm confused.

1:15:53.830 --> 1:15:57.168
My father walked out of my
mom's life before I was born.

1:15:57.200 --> 1:15:59.636
She went hungry many a day
to feed and provide for me.

1:15:59.669 --> 1:16:03.240
So I promised myself when I
got old enough that if able

1:16:03.274 --> 1:16:06.244
I would give her everything
that my father should have.

1:16:06.276 --> 1:16:08.913
So it's not a holiday, birthday
or any day that goes by

1:16:08.945 --> 1:16:10.314
where I don't try to give her
the best

1:16:10.346 --> 1:16:11.815
that life has to offer.

1:16:11.848 --> 1:16:13.717
Well, your mother is very
fortunate

1:16:13.751 --> 1:16:15.919
because I don't think
there's a woman alive

1:16:15.953 --> 1:16:18.522
that wouldn't wish for
that quality in a man.

1:16:18.556 --> 1:16:21.459
Well, I'm not trying to
win an award or nothing.

1:16:23.293 --> 1:16:25.162
You sure are easy to talk to.

1:16:26.564 --> 1:16:27.499
So are you.

1:17:05.769 --> 1:17:08.338
You have the lawyers for
Martin and Kendall at noon.

1:17:08.372 --> 1:17:09.507
That meeting's gonna run long,

1:17:09.539 --> 1:17:10.774
so will you order us something
to eat?

1:17:10.807 --> 1:17:12.275
Sure, what do you feel like?

1:17:12.309 --> 1:17:13.543
Whatever you had yesterday is
fine.

1:17:13.577 --> 1:17:14.779
Can we try something
different?

1:17:14.811 --> 1:17:16.881
I had lasagna, you had
spaghetti.

1:17:16.913 --> 1:17:18.481
I had a bad experience with
it.

1:17:18.515 --> 1:17:19.348
Why?

1:17:19.382 --> 1:17:20.316
Well, they delivered the
meatballs

1:17:20.350 --> 1:17:22.419
but they forget the
spaghetti and the sauce.

1:17:22.453 --> 1:17:24.222
They clearly have zero
compassion

1:17:24.254 --> 1:17:26.390
for young starving assistants.

1:17:26.422 --> 1:17:27.290
They took care of it, right?

1:17:27.324 --> 1:17:28.192
Yeah, but I was hungry.

1:17:28.225 --> 1:17:29.526
By the time they brought the
spaghetti,

1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:30.895
I had already eaten the
meatballs.

1:17:30.927 --> 1:17:32.262
That must've sucked.

1:17:32.296 --> 1:17:33.263
Tell me about it.

1:17:33.297 --> 1:17:35.533
Okay, well we won't
be ordering from them.

1:17:36.900 --> 1:17:37.769
Hey.

1:17:38.769 --> 1:17:39.637
Hi.

1:17:40.370 --> 1:17:43.208
I forgot to tell you, Mr.
James is here.

1:17:44.275 --> 1:17:45.643
What stopped you?

1:17:45.676 --> 1:17:46.744
The meatballs.

1:17:46.776 --> 1:17:47.845
Thank you, Sam.

1:17:53.316 --> 1:17:54.718
I'm sorry.

1:17:54.752 --> 1:17:56.521
Why, did you do something
wrong?

1:17:57.254 --> 1:18:00.423
I didn't call you, but
by no means does that

1:18:00.457 --> 1:18:02.959
reflect the time that we spent
together.

1:18:02.993 --> 1:18:04.629
It was incredible.

1:18:04.662 --> 1:18:09.633
Yeah, it was.

1:18:11.802 --> 1:18:12.804
Excuse me.

1:18:14.471 --> 1:18:15.606
Nina, what are you trying to
tell me

1:18:15.638 --> 1:18:17.574
that you're not telling me?

1:18:17.607 --> 1:18:19.276
I liked you from the moment I
met you,

1:18:19.310 --> 1:18:20.544
but I can't do this.

1:18:22.413 --> 1:18:24.515
I spoke with Tamika and
she let me know what you do

1:18:24.547 --> 1:18:26.783
beyond the restaurants and
stores.

1:18:26.816 --> 1:18:28.752
When I told you my brother died,

1:18:28.785 --> 1:18:31.422
he was murdered by a drug
dealer.

1:18:31.454 --> 1:18:32.922
So you think I'm gonna end up
like him

1:18:32.955 --> 1:18:34.425
and you gonna lose me, too.

1:18:36.793 --> 1:18:38.561
You're far too smart to get
caught up

1:18:38.595 --> 1:18:39.763
the way my brother did.

1:18:42.365 --> 1:18:47.004
It's about respect, respect
for his life, his memory.

1:18:47.872 --> 1:18:50.742
I can't see myself living
off what he died for.

1:18:52.676 --> 1:18:53.745
I can respect that.

1:18:58.047 --> 1:18:59.716
And I probably shouldn't say
this,

1:18:59.749 --> 1:19:01.551
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1:19:01.584 --> 1:19:03.954
You will never ever get over me.

1:19:04.855 --> 1:19:07.492
I was meant for you and
you were meant for me.

1:19:10.127 --> 1:19:10.961
How do you know that?

1:19:10.994 --> 1:19:12.563
Nobody knows that much.

1:19:14.131 --> 1:19:15.999
I know 'cause I know what love
is.

1:19:30.114 --> 1:19:34.552
Mrs. Cerrone, this is Bernard
James, a business associate

1:19:34.584 --> 1:19:36.553
and very good friend of your
husband's.

1:19:44.561 --> 1:19:49.000
Rose, Tony was like a
brother to me, I'm so sorry.

1:19:49.900 --> 1:19:50.802
Whatever you need.

1:20:06.482 --> 1:20:08.386
Reach out to Detective O'Neal.

1:20:08.418 --> 1:20:11.154
I want this boy put to
bed as soon as possible.

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:20.397
Bill Blass, you was just gonna
leave

1:20:20.431 --> 1:20:25.436
without saying goodbye,
after we gave you a job?

1:20:25.769 --> 1:20:26.870
Ow, fuck!

1:20:28.872 --> 1:20:33.543
Look, guys, it's not what you
think it is.

1:20:33.577 --> 1:20:34.412
Oh yeah?

1:20:34.445 --> 1:20:35.113
No.

1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:37.580
What is it?

1:20:37.614 --> 1:20:39.649
You guys saw how shit was
going down.

1:20:40.516 --> 1:20:43.686
I was gonna give the money
back, I was only holding onto it

1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:48.458
in case there was a raid
or shit got complicated.

1:20:48.492 --> 1:20:49.693
It's true.

1:20:52.663 --> 1:20:53.531
Yeah.

1:20:54.832 --> 1:20:55.999
Come on, guys, you gotta
believe me.

1:20:56.033 --> 1:20:56.901
Man, shut up.

1:20:56.934 --> 1:20:57.802
Hold on.

1:21:01.038 --> 1:21:01.906
Yo.

1:21:05.742 --> 1:21:06.944
All right.

1:21:06.976 --> 1:21:09.212
Ay, y'all let Dutch
know whatever he needs,

1:21:09.245 --> 1:21:12.182
whatever it is, I got him,
whatever.

1:21:12.216 --> 1:21:14.685
Yeah, I know, Dutch told us.

1:21:14.717 --> 1:21:16.052
He got a job for you.

1:21:16.086 --> 1:21:17.488
Only you can do it, Bill.

1:21:18.154 --> 1:21:20.457
Well, can I at least get
dressed first?

1:21:20.490 --> 1:21:23.694
Of course, Dutch has a
special outfit for you.

1:21:23.726 --> 1:21:25.529
Like I said, anything for
Dutch.

1:21:29.098 --> 1:21:30.501
What the fuck is that?

1:21:30.534 --> 1:21:31.602
It's an option vest.

1:21:33.203 --> 1:21:35.506
You got two options.

1:21:35.538 --> 1:21:39.108
Either you put this vest
on that Dutch made for you

1:21:39.141 --> 1:21:42.846
and you take some people
out along with yourself.

1:21:42.879 --> 1:21:45.682
Option two, we kill your whole
family.

1:21:46.650 --> 1:21:48.486
What the fuck you wanna do?

1:21:48.519 --> 1:21:51.588
Your wife, your daughter,
your mother, your dad,

1:21:51.622 --> 1:21:52.856
your grandfather, your cousin

1:21:52.890 --> 1:21:56.727
and bubblefuck, we killing
everybody.

1:21:56.760 --> 1:21:58.529
Fuck, I think I just pissed
myself.

1:21:58.561 --> 1:21:59.963
Fine, I'll fucking do it.

1:22:01.198 --> 1:22:02.900
I'll put the fucking vest on.

1:22:02.932 --> 1:22:07.204
I thought you might
say that, wise choice.

1:22:11.208 --> 1:22:13.544
Yo, that nigga Roc is
really having another baby.

1:22:13.577 --> 1:22:15.646
Man, didn't Aisha say it
wasn't gonna be no nother one?

1:22:15.678 --> 1:22:18.781
Ha, Roc's a little bitch.

1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:33.129
Secure all the exits,
we're going upstairs.

1:22:33.163 --> 1:22:34.031
Move!

1:22:43.906 --> 1:22:46.744
Yeah, yeah bro, it's a boy.

1:22:46.776 --> 1:22:47.645
Big boy.

1:22:48.779 --> 1:22:53.684
Rahmin Abdul, also known
as Roc, you're under arrest.

1:22:55.619 --> 1:22:56.754
It's over.

1:22:56.787 --> 1:22:58.989
You have the right to remain
silent.

1:22:59.021 --> 1:23:00.056
I just had a baby.

1:23:00.089 --> 1:23:00.923
- Let's go.
- I just had a baby.

1:23:00.958 --> 1:23:03.160
If you give up that
right...

1:23:06.663 --> 1:23:07.698
What the fuck?

1:23:07.730 --> 1:23:08.798
Fuck he smiling at?

1:23:16.172 --> 1:23:18.041
What they call it when you don't
wanna have the baby no more

1:23:18.074 --> 1:23:20.209
and you get your nuts clipped?

1:23:20.243 --> 1:23:22.913
The snip, that's a vasectomy.

1:23:22.945 --> 1:23:23.780
Vasectomy?

1:23:23.814 --> 1:23:28.017
Yeah...

1:23:32.623 --> 1:23:33.290
Come on!

1:24:22.372 --> 1:24:25.008
Get a couple bottles to
table 12, no sparklies, though.

1:24:25.042 --> 1:24:25.943
Keep it low key.

1:24:29.812 --> 1:24:34.150
Dutch, bruh, Zoom is dead.

1:24:34.184 --> 1:24:37.287
and they got Angel on lockdown,
the feds.

1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:39.056
Roc and Angel ain't gonna
flip.

1:24:49.266 --> 1:24:52.770
Detective, you claim that
Mr. Bernard James is the cause

1:24:52.802 --> 1:24:55.004
for your early retirement.

1:24:55.038 --> 1:24:58.776
Yes, he ordered that the
27th Precinct be blown up.

1:24:59.476 --> 1:25:02.846
He sent a psycho into the
station strapped with C4.

1:25:02.878 --> 1:25:04.948
He blew himself up and my fellow
officers.

1:25:04.980 --> 1:25:08.151
Objections, your honor, calls
for facts not in evidence.

1:25:08.185 --> 1:25:09.053
Overruled.

1:25:09.086 --> 1:25:09.919
Exception.

1:25:09.953 --> 1:25:10.787
Noted.

1:25:10.820 --> 1:25:13.457
Now, Mr. O'Neal, how can you
be sure

1:25:13.489 --> 1:25:16.092
that Mr. Bernard James
was indeed responsible

1:25:16.126 --> 1:25:17.360
for that explosion?

1:25:17.394 --> 1:25:19.762
The suicide bomber's
name was William Brent.

1:25:19.796 --> 1:25:21.330
He also went by Bill Blass.

1:25:21.364 --> 1:25:23.701
He was a small-time hustler.

1:25:23.734 --> 1:25:25.169
He sent his wife a letter the
morning

1:25:25.202 --> 1:25:26.837
before he entered the building.

1:25:29.338 --> 1:25:30.940
Is this the letter?

1:25:30.973 --> 1:25:32.042
Objection.

1:25:32.074 --> 1:25:33.677
Counsel, get up here now.

1:25:40.350 --> 1:25:41.450
I'm very surprised.

1:25:41.485 --> 1:25:43.954
The defense has never received
a copy of this letter.

1:25:43.986 --> 1:25:47.091
Your honor, we received this
this morning by the witness.

1:25:47.123 --> 1:25:48.825
You knew he'd be introducing
this letter

1:25:48.859 --> 1:25:49.927
as your witness prep.

1:25:49.959 --> 1:25:50.860
I'll allow it.

1:25:50.895 --> 1:25:52.930
He has a duty to turn over all
evidence.

1:25:52.962 --> 1:25:54.263
I said I'll allow it.

1:25:54.297 --> 1:25:55.232
Your honor.

1:25:55.265 --> 1:25:57.168
Counsel, I made my
ruling, step back now.

1:26:16.787 --> 1:26:20.757
Dear Monique, by the time
you get this, I'll be dead,

1:26:20.790 --> 1:26:23.392
but I wanted you to know
that it's because of Dutch.

1:26:23.426 --> 1:26:26.296
He said if I don't do what
he says, he's gonna kill you,

1:26:26.329 --> 1:26:29.032
the kids and my whole family.

1:26:29.065 --> 1:26:31.101
So this is my sacrifice.

1:26:31.133 --> 1:26:32.336
I gladly make it, too.

1:26:33.102 --> 1:26:36.405
When you get this, deliver
it to the authorities,

1:26:36.439 --> 1:26:38.475
the DA or someone like that.

1:26:38.507 --> 1:26:40.910
Don't give it to no regular cop,
though.

1:26:40.944 --> 1:26:43.280
I love you, pray for my soul.

1:26:43.312 --> 1:26:44.315
Love always, Billy.

1:27:34.897 --> 1:27:35.865
Hey, Michelle.

1:27:35.899 --> 1:27:36.566
You're blessed.

1:27:44.507 --> 1:27:48.178
Your best was good but it
wasn't good enough, accept it.

1:27:48.211 --> 1:27:50.580
The trial isn't over,
you haven't won yet.

1:27:50.614 --> 1:27:52.115
I'll do you a favor,

1:27:52.147 --> 1:27:54.051
I'll take the death penalty off
the table.

1:27:54.083 --> 1:27:55.118
That's your offer?

1:27:55.151 --> 1:27:57.421
Look, I don't wanna
see your client executed.

1:27:57.454 --> 1:28:00.224
I prefer to watch him rot in
prison for the rest of his life

1:28:00.257 --> 1:28:02.526
as a gleaming example for
those who break the law

1:28:02.559 --> 1:28:03.494
on my watch.

1:28:03.526 --> 1:28:05.561
You mean as an example
for financial donors

1:28:05.595 --> 1:28:06.997
in your bid for governor.

1:28:12.068 --> 1:28:13.436
I'll even let you choose the
prison

1:28:13.470 --> 1:28:15.038
where he serves out his life
sentence.

1:28:15.070 --> 1:28:17.341
You haven't met the
elements, I can still win this.

1:28:17.373 --> 1:28:19.342
If not now, then on appeal.

1:28:19.376 --> 1:28:21.144
Unless you become a magician,

1:28:21.177 --> 1:28:22.880
we all know what's gonna happen.

1:28:23.980 --> 1:28:27.581
You have until before
closing arguments tomorrow,

1:28:27.583 --> 1:28:28.985
take that to your client.

1:28:33.690 --> 1:28:35.125
We'll take the next one.

1:29:07.089 --> 1:29:09.126
The jury is split.

1:29:09.159 --> 1:29:12.696
I've been advocating strongly
on behalf of Mr. James.

1:29:12.729 --> 1:29:15.633
So when I flip against him,
everyone else will follow.

1:29:16.598 --> 1:29:17.501
He's toast.

1:29:32.147 --> 1:29:35.084
I asked my judge, Dutch
will never see daylight,

1:29:35.118 --> 1:29:36.220
I promise you that.

1:29:37.654 --> 1:29:40.324
Nobody fucks with me.

1:29:51.735 --> 1:29:54.037
You know you're a
very sexy woman, right?

1:29:54.070 --> 1:29:56.140
If I didn't, I would be an
idiot.

1:29:57.373 --> 1:29:59.510
You'll go out your
way not to be an idiot.

1:30:01.744 --> 1:30:03.446
Are you getting enough to eat?

1:30:04.681 --> 1:30:06.083
I was on a diet.

1:30:06.115 --> 1:30:07.184
Exercise?

1:30:07.984 --> 1:30:08.952
I was waiting for you to stop
by

1:30:08.985 --> 1:30:11.755
to see if you wanted to
get in a pickup game.

1:30:11.788 --> 1:30:13.390
You like doing that, don't
you?

1:30:13.422 --> 1:30:14.457
Doing what?

1:30:14.490 --> 1:30:16.025
Pretending things are
worse than what they are.

1:30:16.059 --> 1:30:17.761
Oh, I ain't gotta pretend.

1:30:17.793 --> 1:30:20.997
I'll spend a couple of years
in here and then be executed.

1:30:21.030 --> 1:30:24.066
The judge and the jury are
already bought and paid for.

1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.502
Can you prove that?

1:30:25.534 --> 1:30:28.037
No, but you'll know
I'm telling the truth

1:30:28.070 --> 1:30:29.171
because the man that
bought and paid for it

1:30:29.204 --> 1:30:31.173
will be in court tomorrow.

1:30:31.207 --> 1:30:34.177
He ain't gonna miss the
opportunity to see me burn.

1:30:34.209 --> 1:30:36.046
Then why are they offering
to take the death penalty

1:30:36.079 --> 1:30:38.349
off the table and get
you to choose the prison?

1:30:39.815 --> 1:30:42.019
That's to torture me first.

1:30:42.052 --> 1:30:43.387
It's still a death sentence.

1:30:44.486 --> 1:30:45.521
It's a discreet phone call

1:30:45.555 --> 1:30:48.057
from one prison official to
another.

1:30:48.091 --> 1:30:50.227
Suddenly, a Newark drug
dealer is found dead

1:30:50.260 --> 1:30:51.595
in his cell from suicide.

1:30:51.628 --> 1:30:53.063
Nobody'll question it.

1:30:54.329 --> 1:30:55.798
I'll question it.

1:30:55.832 --> 1:30:57.100
It doesn't matter.

1:30:57.132 --> 1:30:58.401
It'll be like the Freddie Gray
case

1:30:58.435 --> 1:31:00.604
and countless others before me.

1:31:00.637 --> 1:31:02.072
Nobody'll be convicted.

1:31:03.472 --> 1:31:05.641
If you felt that way,
why did you hire me?

1:31:07.342 --> 1:31:08.378
Here Comes the Sun.

1:31:09.745 --> 1:31:11.015
Nina Simone song?

1:31:12.181 --> 1:31:13.050
Somebody told me once

1:31:13.083 --> 1:31:14.785
that song promised a better
tomorrow.

1:31:18.821 --> 1:31:19.757
I'm not done yet.

1:31:39.575 --> 1:31:41.078
You're watching Wake Up New
Jersey.

1:31:41.110 --> 1:31:41.979
I'm David Greenwood.

1:31:42.012 --> 1:31:43.213
Today, we're keeping a very
close eye

1:31:43.247 --> 1:31:46.816
on what could only be described
as the most important trial

1:31:46.850 --> 1:31:49.086
in the history of Newark.

1:31:49.119 --> 1:31:50.620
District attorney Anthony Jacobs

1:31:50.653 --> 1:31:52.222
and defense attorney Michelle
Nichols

1:31:52.254 --> 1:31:53.856
are about to begin their closing
remarks

1:31:53.890 --> 1:31:54.958
in the trial of Bernard James.

1:31:54.990 --> 1:31:57.793
This is all happening today
and I can tell you guys

1:31:57.827 --> 1:32:00.297
from personal experience
that at most trials,

1:32:00.329 --> 1:32:03.566
it all hinges on these closing
arguments by the attorneys.

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:05.869
However, the defense attorney
appears to be playing

1:32:05.901 --> 1:32:08.171
by the New Jersey Nets rule,

1:32:08.204 --> 1:32:10.440
as in they've already lost the
game

1:32:10.472 --> 1:32:12.408
but they're still on the court.

1:32:12.441 --> 1:32:14.610
Stay with us as we follow
this developing story

1:32:14.644 --> 1:32:16.646
as it all unfolds.

1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:39.436
All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

1:32:57.587 --> 1:32:59.489
You may be seated.

1:32:59.521 --> 1:33:00.457
Bring in the jury.

1:33:18.975 --> 1:33:19.910
Are you prepared to proceed

1:33:19.943 --> 1:33:22.244
with your closing statements,
counselors?

1:33:22.278 --> 1:33:23.446
Yes, your honor, I am.

1:33:33.823 --> 1:33:36.793
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, you have just sat

1:33:36.825 --> 1:33:39.261
through three weeks of the
biggest

1:33:39.294 --> 1:33:41.832
and baddest gangster movie ever
performed.

1:33:42.665 --> 1:33:46.302
It was better than the
Godfather, better than Casino.

1:33:46.336 --> 1:33:50.973
It reminded me of Scarface
and just as fictitious.

1:33:51.007 --> 1:33:55.845
It was written, directed and
produced by your very own

1:33:55.878 --> 1:33:58.315
district attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

1:33:59.281 --> 1:34:00.751
He deserves an Oscar.

1:34:04.787 --> 1:34:09.258
But this isn't Hollywood,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:34:09.292 --> 1:34:11.561
There's a man's life at stake.

1:34:11.593 --> 1:34:14.263
And in these past few
weeks, not a single fact

1:34:14.297 --> 1:34:18.267
has been presented by
Attorney Jacobs, not one.

1:34:18.301 --> 1:34:20.971
He has merely presented
circumstantial evidence

1:34:21.003 --> 1:34:24.341
held together by the
weak glue of assumption.

1:34:24.373 --> 1:34:28.278
Assumption of crooked cops,
gangsters turned ministers,

1:34:28.311 --> 1:34:31.815
five and dime hustlers and
not one law abiding citizen

1:34:31.847 --> 1:34:34.350
in the bunch, not one.

1:34:35.118 --> 1:34:38.754
He brings waywardness and the
faith of truth and glorifies

1:34:38.788 --> 1:34:42.792
every word that comes out of
his mouth as to lure you away

1:34:42.824 --> 1:34:45.962
from what's real, what's true.

1:34:46.896 --> 1:34:48.964
And the witnesses he produced
certainly

1:34:48.998 --> 1:34:51.702
aren't credible enough
to hang a man's life on.

1:34:52.834 --> 1:34:53.802
The district attorney

1:34:53.836 --> 1:34:58.275
has not proven Mr. James
committed any crimes.

1:34:58.307 --> 1:34:59.908
What crimes did he commit?

1:34:59.941 --> 1:35:01.910
I still don't know.

1:35:01.944 --> 1:35:04.446
And it's supposed to be up
to you to find out based

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.450
on the evidence supplied by the
state?

1:35:08.818 --> 1:35:10.520
I don't think so.

1:35:10.552 --> 1:35:12.622
I don't think the jury
should confuse itself

1:35:12.654 --> 1:35:15.624
with the manuscripts
attorney Jacobs presented

1:35:15.658 --> 1:35:17.794
with the real facts of this
case.

1:35:19.028 --> 1:35:21.463
If you do that, then you will
only see

1:35:21.497 --> 1:35:24.501
that Mr. James is
innocent of these crimes.

1:35:28.471 --> 1:35:29.339
Thank you.

1:35:33.476 --> 1:35:35.779
Ladies and gentlemen, I
wanna thank you for your time

1:35:35.811 --> 1:35:39.548
and your patience throughout
these past few weeks.

1:35:39.582 --> 1:35:42.552
As I said in the beginning, I
mean, we could be doing a lot

1:35:42.584 --> 1:35:45.388
of other things but it was our
duty

1:35:46.455 --> 1:35:48.958
to ourselves and to each other.

1:35:48.990 --> 1:35:50.760
These past few weeks, we've been
submerged

1:35:50.793 --> 1:35:53.630
in the murky waters of
Bernard James' life,

1:35:53.663 --> 1:35:57.434
his disregard for life, law
and order and the property

1:35:57.467 --> 1:36:00.737
of others from his youth,
stealing cars to the present.

1:36:00.770 --> 1:36:04.107
His existence has been
filled with bloodshed,

1:36:04.140 --> 1:36:08.645
murder, innocent victims
and shattered lives.

1:36:08.677 --> 1:36:11.914
Now, we must do for Simone
Greenwood, her mother and father

1:36:11.948 --> 1:36:14.551
what they are not here to do
today.

1:36:14.583 --> 1:36:17.586
And Detective O'Neal
from the 27th Precinct,

1:36:17.619 --> 1:36:19.789
the survivors and their
families.

1:36:20.789 --> 1:36:23.392
Your duty is to them now.

1:36:24.961 --> 1:36:28.731
Your duty is to honor each and
every life

1:36:28.765 --> 1:36:32.569
that Bernard James has
taken because if you don't,

1:36:34.704 --> 1:36:37.541
the lives that he takes in the
future

1:36:38.574 --> 1:36:40.911
will be blood on your hands.

1:36:42.578 --> 1:36:45.615
Let's hope and pray that
the next victim isn't you

1:36:45.647 --> 1:36:50.619
or you, your brother, your
sister, your mom, your dad,

1:36:50.653 --> 1:36:52.588
your husband, your wife

1:36:54.489 --> 1:36:55.458
or your children.

1:36:57.427 --> 1:36:59.763
If you we do not find justice

1:36:59.796 --> 1:37:02.865
and find the defendant
Bernard James guilty today,

1:37:04.199 --> 1:37:05.968
then each and every one of you

1:37:07.003 --> 1:37:08.705
will leave this courtroom today

1:37:08.738 --> 1:37:11.475
as guilty as this man right
here.

1:37:24.654 --> 1:37:26.022
Thank you, Attorney Jacobs.

1:40:06.649 --> 1:40:08.818
Michelle Nichols, I saw you on
TV.

1:40:08.851 --> 1:40:09.919
You did an amazing job.

1:40:09.952 --> 1:40:12.221
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:40:16.225 --> 1:40:17.694
Hey, check it out, king.

1:40:17.726 --> 1:40:19.261
Ay, you work in that courthouse,
huh?

1:40:19.294 --> 1:40:20.195
Yeah, bruh.

1:40:20.230 --> 1:40:21.830
Yeah, I got an
opportunity of a lifetime.

1:40:33.175 --> 1:40:37.212
You'll get the other
100 when the job's done.
