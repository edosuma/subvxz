WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:05.439
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:09.210 --> 00:12.213
(watch beeping)

00:23.157 --> 00:24.192
Jenn?

00:24.225 --> 00:26.694
Is everything
all right?

00:26.727 --> 00:29.197
Are we at war?

00:29.230 --> 00:32.300
Mom, we're off the East Coast
of the United States.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.601
I hope not.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.203
Well, then what are you doing?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.204
Reporting for duty.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.371
In the middle of the night?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.539
Ships don't sleep.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.308
In that case,
I'll come with you.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.509
Mom, please, don't.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.313
That's the point
of a Tiger cruise.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.215
A chance for friends and family

00:47.248 --> 00:49.717
to experience Navy life
firsthand, right?

00:49.750 --> 00:51.319
Technically... yes.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.854
But we spent all day
together yesterday,

00:53.887 --> 00:54.688
and we'll have all day today.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.191
Exactly. The more time,
the better.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.460
Unless you're trying to get

00:59.493 --> 01:01.729
rid of me to go see a boy.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.132
Mom! What...
I know the Navy
frowns upon that,

01:04.165 --> 01:05.766
but you have my blessing.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.136
As long as you spill
all the details later.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.137
I love you, Mom.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.239
Go back to sleep.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.740
Well, at least tell his name.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.275
Sure.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.244
Everyone calls him Elmer.

01:16.277 --> 01:20.181
Is he at least an officer?

01:25.186 --> 01:27.188
(indistinct radio chatter
in distance)

01:30.358 --> 01:32.293
Morning, Elmer.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.133
So, I hope you don't mind,

01:39.167 --> 01:42.203
but I had to tell Mom
about our love affair.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.804
I know.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.739
I'm the one who begged her
to come on the Tiger cruise.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.408
(sighs)

01:47.441 --> 01:49.543
But now what do I do with her?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.247
(mechanical whirring)

01:57.685 --> 01:59.520
(alarm buzzing)

02:01.689 --> 02:04.225
You're killing me, Elmer.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.427
Don't make me crawl in there.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.274
(gasps)

02:26.914 --> 02:28.916
*

02:57.311 --> 02:59.747
Washington, D.C.,
is a place built by people

02:59.780 --> 03:02.216
who appreciate
math, science and art.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.685
Yeah, architectural geniuses.
Yes.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.520
And twice a year,
that genius is highlighted

03:06.554 --> 03:09.690
when the sun sets perfectly
behind the Washington Monument,

03:09.723 --> 03:11.959
so that the shadow's pinnacle
is touching

03:11.992 --> 03:13.727
the front steps
of the Capitol Building.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.796
(chuckles)
It is perfect symmetry,

03:15.829 --> 03:17.531
perfect balance.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.899
Delilah and I
are very much

03:18.932 --> 03:20.701
into mathematical symmetry,
you know.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.902
Yeah, you speak in binary.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.504
Now, are we almost
at the good part

03:23.537 --> 03:25.373
where you actually propose?

03:25.406 --> 03:26.874
Almost, almost,
'cause with the help

03:26.907 --> 03:29.577
of Abby's friend Ranger Rick...
Burt.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.512
...Delilah and I will take
a private tour

03:31.545 --> 03:33.347
to the top
of the Washington Monument,

03:33.381 --> 03:35.849
where the sun will be setting
perfectly through the window.

03:35.883 --> 03:40.254
I will get down on one knee,
open the box,

03:40.288 --> 03:42.256
and the light
will hit the diamond,

03:42.290 --> 03:44.492
highlighting its perfect
symmetrical cut.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.394
(elevator bell dings)

03:46.427 --> 03:47.761
Then I pop the question.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.996
You're gonna blind her?

03:49.029 --> 03:49.997
What do you mean? That's good.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.365
Isn't that good?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.834
It is incredibly nerdy.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.835
And...

03:54.868 --> 03:56.904
perfect and...

03:56.937 --> 03:58.706
Delilah will love it.

03:58.739 --> 03:59.740
Thank you.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.609
Except...
What?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.311
Well... (sighs)
if I'm not mistaken,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.313
the sun won't be in
that position again

04:05.346 --> 04:06.947
until next year.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.716
Hmm, and who's the nerd?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.352
March 25-- so what?

04:11.385 --> 04:12.453
That's six months away.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.921
I mean, I guarantee the location

04:13.954 --> 04:15.356
and circumstances
don't matter that much.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.824
Back me up, Torres.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.293
Look, the biggest problem
is keeping it a secret.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.861
Tim, you are sweating.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.364
It's hot.
Oh, no, it's actually freezing.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.333
Says the 90-pound thermostat.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.534
Ooh, he's edgy, too.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.501
Yeah.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.603
Sorry. It's... the ring.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.938
Ever since it got here,

04:30.971 --> 04:32.072
I'm acting like
a different person.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.073
Yeah, Gollum.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.309
Look, I've never
met your girl,

04:35.343 --> 04:36.777
but I'm guessing
she'll notice.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.611
What do I do?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.046
GIBBS:
Ask her.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.448
Or stop talking about it.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.383
Ever the romantic.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.318
Got a dead body
on a destroyer.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.686
Quinn and I are in a helo
out of Andrews.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.321
QUINN:
You know, I spent

04:47.355 --> 04:49.657
a year as an agent afloat
early in my career.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.091
It was amazing, but

04:51.124 --> 04:52.860
would any one
of you rather go?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.027
24 hours of seasickness?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.629
No, thanks.
I'll pass.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.531
You know, they make
medication for that.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.966
Do they ever.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.534
I bought all
nine different

05:00.568 --> 05:02.470
motion sickness remedies
just in case.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.604
Um, where's Ducky?

05:03.637 --> 05:04.972
Oh, he's already seasick.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.108
He ate some bad shrimp
last night.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.110
He got food poisoning.
(elevator bell dings)

05:10.143 --> 05:11.745
He...

05:11.779 --> 05:12.913
(elevator bell dings)

05:12.946 --> 05:13.947
Bye.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.982
Oh...

05:18.686 --> 05:20.821
(indistinct chatter over P.A.)

05:23.090 --> 05:24.658
REY:
Hate the circumstances,

05:24.692 --> 05:25.659
but welcome aboard.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.960
Commander Eleadora Rey.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.462
Special Agent Gibbs and Quinn.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.464
Assistant M.E. Palmer.

05:30.498 --> 05:34.402
Quinn-- I knew an agent afloat
by that name, long time ago.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.437
Uh-oh. Did I
arrest you?

05:36.470 --> 05:37.838
No.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.408
What was it the boys
used to call you?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.443
The Heartbreaker?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.116
Something like that.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.552
Heartbreaker?

05:54.788 --> 05:55.856
MAN:
Attention on deck!

05:55.889 --> 05:58.426
Carry on.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.462
So, this is a two-night cruise
from Mayport to Norfolk.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.896
Scheduled to arrive tomorrow,

06:02.930 --> 06:04.565
but the Navy's looking
for answers before then.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.467
QUINN: Before everyone
gets off the ship?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.768
It's my job
to worry about everyone

06:07.801 --> 06:08.869
while they're on the ship.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.473
In addition to a full crew,
we got 63 civilian Tigers.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.042
Excuse me, why do you
call them "Tigers"?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.410
Oh, that's classified.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.911
You serious about that?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.449
No, but the real answer
would bore you.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.184
I'd prefer to keep
this whole thing low-key.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.487
If word of a murder gets out...
It can get messy.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.921
You got an I.D. on the body?

06:27.955 --> 06:29.590
Took muster
after we found the body,

06:29.623 --> 06:31.191
and the ship's nav
failed to report.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.427
But we waited
to move anything.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.463
It's like you said-- messy.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.099
(camera clicking)

06:41.502 --> 06:43.136
Blunt force trauma to the head?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.772
JIMMY:
Could be from an object

06:44.805 --> 06:46.907
or from the compactor itself,
which is clearly

06:46.940 --> 06:48.509
very, very effective.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.580
I'm going with object.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.815
QUINN:
Ooh.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.984
Huh.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.887
Looks like what they use to push
the trash through the pulper.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.522
JIMMY: If you guys are
done photo-documenting,

07:01.555 --> 07:02.456
I can move the body now.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.891
Yeah, do it. Commander?

07:09.597 --> 07:12.566
Lieutenant Vivian Mills,
navigator.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.501
She have family on board?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.968
WOMAN (over intercom):
Lieutenant Mills,

07:15.002 --> 07:16.570
please report to the wardroom.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.672
Lieutenant Mills
to the wardroom.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.541
Your Tiger is looking for you.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.209
Victim had one
Tiger on board.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.178
A cousin--
David Kemmons.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.814
Don't need
to start a panic,

07:26.847 --> 07:30.684
so we're going to inform him
quietly and privately.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.553
Understood?

07:32.586 --> 07:33.854
We prefer it that way.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.892
(people chattering,
phones chiming)

07:38.926 --> 07:40.561
Where's my cousin?
What's going on?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.596
Everybody's been talking.
Has there been a murder?

07:42.630 --> 07:45.065
Ah. Word travels fast
on a ship.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.534
I remember that now.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.735
Not just the ship.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.169
I mean, it's all over
social media.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.571
The whole damn world knows.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.887
BISHOP: "On Navy cruise.
People acting weird.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.223
"A bunch of NCSI agents

08:10.257 --> 08:12.593
"just got here.
Has there been a murder?

08:12.626 --> 08:15.062
#SupportOurTroops,
#MurderBoat."

08:15.095 --> 08:16.630
It's a ship, murder ship.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.766
Too late-- murder boat's
already trending.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.267
Who's Kasey Powers?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.268
The teen pop star?

08:22.770 --> 08:23.637
"Summer Scrubs"?

08:23.671 --> 08:24.972
"Boyfriend, Annoyfriend"?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.239
Girls are so angry.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.975
BISHOP:
Kasey was

08:28.008 --> 08:29.810
my spirit animal
during my divorce.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.844
McGEE:
Turns out she's on board

08:30.878 --> 08:33.113
the Hoover as part
of a military goodwill tour.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.948
No concerts, just publicity.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.050
KP has three million followers
who are

08:37.084 --> 08:39.987
pretty mad that the shipboard
Internet has now been disabled.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.255
Heaven forbid
they wait on any facts.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.792
Right. Ship's navigator,

08:44.825 --> 08:45.926
Lieutenant Vivian Mills

08:45.959 --> 08:48.796
was found dead in the ship's
solid waste processing area.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.097
The trash room.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.232
BISHOP: Spotless record,
multiple commendations,

08:52.265 --> 08:53.801
model officer.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.202
Yeah, at first glance.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.637
You have evidence otherwise?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.871
TORRES:
I got nothing, but nobody

08:57.905 --> 09:00.007
goes to the trash room
for high tea.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.842
She could've been involved
in something illegal.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.644
TORRES:
Yeah.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.045
Everyone has a dark side.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.985
Hey, Ellie?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.587
I wanted to ask
you something.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.255
(sputters)
Please, do not practice on me.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.357
What? No, I'm not
gonna practice on you.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.760
Wait, I think that
I've come up with a way

09:19.793 --> 09:21.194
to keep my
engagement secret.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.596
It involves me?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.732
Look, we've
established, firmly,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.266
that I cannot be
around this ring

09:26.299 --> 09:28.201
without completely
spoiling it, okay?

09:28.235 --> 09:31.639
So, until I propose, will
you hang on to it for me?

09:31.672 --> 09:32.706
For six months?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.642
Out of sight, out of mind.
Delilah won't find it,

09:34.675 --> 09:35.876
I won't be
thinking about it.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.244
But I'm having lunch
with her tomorrow.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.178
It's already
gonna be hard enough

09:38.211 --> 09:39.780
not to say anything.
No, it's gonna be fine.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.248
What about Torres?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.717
Oh, I'm-I'm touched,

09:43.751 --> 09:46.854
but you two clearly have
this nerd thing going on.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.055
(grunts)

09:50.123 --> 09:52.259
Eleanor Bishop...
(groans)

09:52.292 --> 09:53.727
...can you please be my Frodo?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.963
See? That's just beautiful.

09:58.932 --> 09:59.800
(mouths):
Thank you.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.272
QUINN:
You and your cousin were close?

10:05.305 --> 10:07.941
We grew up
in Maine together.

10:07.975 --> 10:11.845
She joined the Navy
so she could travel the world.

10:11.879 --> 10:15.683
I stayed behind
to teach college history.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.285
But, yeah, we kept in touch.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.921
When was the last time
you saw the lieutenant?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.657
Last night, before I went
to sleep in male berthing.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.727
Have you been on
a Navy ship before?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.295
This was my first time.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.398
Been bugging Vivian
to sponsor me on a Tiger cruise

10:31.431 --> 10:33.266
for the past two years.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.236
She usually brings
her dad, but...

10:36.269 --> 10:38.105
he passed last winter.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.809
And so, without
any other family...

10:41.842 --> 10:43.844
she finally gave in.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.746
She could be pretty stubborn.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.447
You in male berthing all night?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.315
Yeah.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.318
Yes, uh...

10:51.351 --> 10:52.352
I...

10:55.022 --> 10:56.790
Is this an interrogation?

10:56.824 --> 10:57.925
QUINN:
No.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.059
We're-we're just talking.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.027
He's not.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.863
I had nothing
to do with this.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.866
Now, until you two can find
my cousin's killer...

11:05.899 --> 11:07.935
I'd like to be left alone.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.141
(door opens)

11:15.776 --> 11:18.912
Agent Quinn the Heartbreaker.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.081
(chuckles)
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.751
She is a very handsome woman.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.786
It's just that agents
are supposed to enforce policy,

11:25.819 --> 11:27.755
not break it.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.023
The Navy's stance on
fraternization is quite clear.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.925
DUCKY (over speaker):
Mr. Palmer.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.795
They won't even allow spouses
or significant others

11:34.828 --> 11:36.463
to go on overnight
Tiger cruises.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.965
Yes, I'm aware of that.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.233
But can we get back
to the question at hand?

11:40.267 --> 11:41.902
Oh, of course, Doctor.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.136
How is that food poisoning?

11:43.170 --> 11:44.972
I meant the victim.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.440
Although, I'm feeling
much better, thank you.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.943
Right. Uh, Agent Gibbs
is having me take the body

11:49.977 --> 11:52.479
and all the trash room evidence
back to D.C.,

11:52.512 --> 11:55.048
but we won't know any more until
after the autopsy, of course.

11:55.082 --> 11:59.820
Of course. However, there is
the matter of the left arm.

11:59.853 --> 12:03.991
There appears to be something
compacted into the flesh.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.993
Yeah. I can't tell
what this is exactly,

12:06.026 --> 12:08.128
other than some sort of metal.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.831
It's odd,
considering her body was found

12:10.864 --> 12:13.133
in the paper goods machine.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.534
I hadn't considered that.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.070
Well, a ship's waste management
system is very thorough.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.306
Plastic, metals,
organic material--

12:19.339 --> 12:21.909
they're all separated
into different machines.

12:21.942 --> 12:25.779
Meaning that our body
and our mystery metal here

12:25.813 --> 12:27.981
could have been dumped
at the same time.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.884
That's information
Agent Gibbs would want sooner

12:30.918 --> 12:32.886
rather than later.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.187
Yes, Doctor.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.889
Uh, except...

12:35.923 --> 12:38.558
it'd be way better if I could
tell him what it actually is

12:38.591 --> 12:41.028
instead of just giving him
a dumb look when he asks.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.863
And he will
definitely ask.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.696
Abigail.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.565
Is everything all right?
I don't know.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.935
You tell me.
You should not come to work

12:47.968 --> 12:49.002
when you're sick.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.504
I had food poisoning,
not the flu.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.506
Really?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.475
Swab and prove it.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.110
I'm busy.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.145
I know.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.813
And I can help. Hi, Jimmy.

12:59.847 --> 13:00.814
Hey, Abby.

13:00.848 --> 13:01.982
So, I have been

13:02.015 --> 13:05.185
studying these crime scene
photos, and it appears that

13:05.218 --> 13:07.921
our mystery metal is an antenna,

13:07.955 --> 13:09.489
like for a remote control.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.124
A remote control for what?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.993
Well, I can't
possibly know that.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.127
Yet.

13:16.196 --> 13:20.868
Mr. Gomer, you were seen
out of your rack last night.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.070
(sighs):
Yes.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.172
It's kind of embarrassing.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.506
Why?

13:26.539 --> 13:30.010
I kept having to call Ralph
on the big white phone.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.845
You were seasick?

13:31.879 --> 13:33.847
Yeah. I mean,
I accidentally

13:33.881 --> 13:35.983
dropped my phone in the
toilet on the last one.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.185
I mean, doesn't even...
even work now,

13:38.218 --> 13:39.452
if you need proof.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.088
No, that's all right.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.122
Yeah, I cleaned it.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.857
I'm good.
All right.

13:43.891 --> 13:44.992
Cute kid though.

13:45.025 --> 13:45.993
Yeah.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.527
Listen, um...

13:49.029 --> 13:51.899
...could you not tell
my Navy buddy that I got sick?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.901
You know, we're not that
close, and, you know,

13:53.934 --> 13:55.969
he's only letting me
mooch a free ride

13:56.003 --> 13:57.938
if I promise
not to embarrass him.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.007
I thought Tigers had to pay.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.976
Sure, but, I mean,
two nights of travel?

14:03.010 --> 14:06.113
I mean, you factor in
gas, food and hotel,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.147
I mean... (scoffs)

14:07.180 --> 14:08.448
this is a steal.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.417
God bless the Navy.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.451
(chuckles):
I know, right?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.553
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.288
GIBBS: Petty Officer Brown,
you're in navigation?

14:15.322 --> 14:16.323
Yes, sir.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.225
I worked under
Lieutenant Mills.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.493
Strict. Hard worker.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.495
But she just joined
the ship, sir.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.296
What does that mean?

14:23.330 --> 14:24.932
I didn't know her
personally, sir.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.133
None of us did.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.600
You know, you can relax,
Petty Officer.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.969
You like to sit down?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.437
No, sir. Thank you, sir.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.105
JaVale!

14:32.805 --> 14:34.407
This is the officers' wardroom.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.277
Yeah. It's real fancy.
Show some respect.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.479
Man, you're the one that wanted
me on this damn murder boat

14:39.512 --> 14:40.613
in the first place.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.982
Oh, wait, don't say it.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.450
Murder ship.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.654
I'm sorry, sir.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.023
Just trying to set a good
example for my little brother.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.058
It's not working.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.360
It will.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.262
Thanks, Petty Officer.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.098
(quietly):
Get up.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.099
Now.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.233
Let's go.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.103
Well, how's this
for suspect triage?

15:03.136 --> 15:06.073
There's only, I don't know,
a hundred more to go.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.975
Yeah. Nobody
knows anything.

15:08.008 --> 15:08.976
No.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.410
Just one big happy family.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.711
MAN 1:
Get the hell away from me!

15:11.744 --> 15:13.080
MAN 2:
Whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.214
MAN 1:
Stop following me,

15:14.247 --> 15:15.682
and stay away
from my client!

15:15.715 --> 15:17.250
Whoa, whoa.
There a problem?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.152
No problem.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.154
It certainly sounds
like one, Mr....?

15:21.188 --> 15:22.722
Curt Shapiro.
I'm Miss Powers' press agent.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.524
I'm in charge
of her goodwill tour.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.459
I was just fending off
the bloodsuckers.

15:26.493 --> 15:30.163
I was trying to get an autograph
for my nine-year-old daughter.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.168
Yeah, those soccer dads
can be so dangerous.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.405
You give one dog a bone, you'll
end up feeding the whole kennel.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.672
So much for goodwill.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.144
Oh, there you are.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.412
(Jimmy pants, chuckles)

15:45.445 --> 15:47.114
Oh, this ship is big, huh?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.281
QUINN:
Yeah.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.482
Is there a problem, Jimmy?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.284
No. Oh, actually,
uh, yeah, maybe.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.453
Uh, the C.O. radioed down
to the crime scene.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.188
She's looking for you,
Agent Gibbs.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.191
Said you're needed in
the maintenance bay.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.096
Commander.
Agent Gibbs,

16:03.130 --> 16:04.697
I don't like
problems on my ship.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.067
So lucky for you,
I found the solution.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.069
Muster list.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.071
While all crew were accounted
for after the muster drill,

16:11.104 --> 16:13.206
we just found an error
in the Tiger count.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.242
62. We're down a man.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.576
Stewart Baxter.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.245
I think we just
I.D.'d your killer.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.415
Seaman Baxter reporting, ma'am.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.251
Seaman, where the hell
is your brother?

16:24.284 --> 16:25.685
Ma'am?
You sponsored
two Tigers--

16:25.718 --> 16:27.087
mother and brother.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.721
Where is Stewart?
He called

16:28.755 --> 16:31.091
just before we left port
to say he had car trouble.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.225
I gave him hell, but...

16:32.259 --> 16:34.561
Ma'am, he never boarded
the ship.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.763
Someone signed in.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.098
Which means we have
another problem.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.367
Yeah. An imposter.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.245
BAXTER: Yeah, well, I hope
you're flexible, because you can

16:52.279 --> 16:54.714
kiss your ass good-bye
when I get done with you.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.584
You already caused me problems,
Stewart, so just get there.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.620
(sighs)

17:00.653 --> 17:02.322
My brother says

17:02.355 --> 17:04.557
he doesn't know who signed
on the ship as him.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.294
But he was headed up to meet
me and my mom in Norfolk,

17:07.327 --> 17:10.130
so getting to NCIS headquarters
won't be a problem.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.464
He's gonna keep his phone on?

17:11.498 --> 17:13.233
Yes. And if he doesn't answer

17:13.266 --> 17:15.835
all of their questions, you have
my permission to shoot him.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.138
Mm.
It'll be a mercy killing.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.777
Not like this job wasn't
hard enough before, you know?

17:24.811 --> 17:26.813
I do, actually.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.816
I spent a year
as the lone NCIS agent

17:29.849 --> 17:32.785
on a floating city of 5,000.
(chuckles)

17:34.821 --> 17:36.623
So how do I convince
my shipmates

17:36.656 --> 17:38.458
that I had nothing to do
with this?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.127
You leave that to us.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.629
We have search crews
all over the ship.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.797
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

17:44.831 --> 17:45.798
My job?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.567
Yes.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.237
Closet safe.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.671
Uh, that's predictable.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.106
Bank box?
Impersonal.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.341
(groans)

17:54.374 --> 17:56.876
Under the mattress.
No.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.379
Look, if you don't like
what I'm coming up with, then...

17:59.412 --> 18:01.381
take the ring back.
I can't take the ring back.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.250
The fact that the ring
isn't in my house

18:03.283 --> 18:05.752
is the reason I slept like
a baby last night, okay?

18:05.785 --> 18:08.421
I had no cold sweats,
I had no nightmares...

18:08.455 --> 18:09.722
You've been having nightmares?

18:09.756 --> 18:10.757
Uh, no.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.192
Uh, I mean, yes.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.860
Not about you though.

18:13.893 --> 18:14.894
Why would they be about me?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.529
BISHOP:
Uh,

18:16.563 --> 18:17.730
he didn't want you to worry.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.132
Sweetie that he is.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.400
What are you
doing here, hon?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.603
I told you
Delilah was coming by.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.871
Oh, that's right,
that's right.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.706
You guys are having lunch.
I'm sorry, I forgot.

18:26.739 --> 18:27.907
You can come if you want to.
TORRES: Oh, no.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.842
McGEE: No, no,
that's okay. I can't...

18:29.876 --> 18:32.312
really come, not today.
Or ever.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.314
Food allergies.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.186
Is everything okay?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.853
(drone whirring)

18:43.223 --> 18:45.325
Hey, Abby found a clue.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.859
Check this out.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.699
Watch it land.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.401
I didn't know
you could fly drones.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.503
Yeah, it seems
a little nerdy for you.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.172
Obviously, you've never seen
an illegal street race.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.640
Wait, with drones?
Oh, yeah.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.210
The first time I saw it was in
the Buenos Aires underground.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.646
They're not as big as
cars, but they're faster

19:06.679 --> 19:08.581
and way more violent. Hi.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.718
Nick Torres.
Hi. Delilah Fielding.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.852
Nice to meet you.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.554
So that remote control

19:14.587 --> 19:16.856
that was compacted
into our dead body

19:16.889 --> 19:19.559
belonged to a
consumer drone.
This exact drone?

19:19.592 --> 19:23.830
No, no. The Navy yard security
confiscated this one a week ago.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.199
But apparently, NCIS has been
having issues with these.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.934
Yeah, yeah.
We had a report last month

19:27.967 --> 19:29.836
about a drone
over the shipyard in Maine.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.272
D.O.D. has the same issue
across the world.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.242
The fear is they're being used
for surveillance or smuggling.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.943
What's one doing
on our Tiger cruise?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.378
I'm gonna call Gibbs.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.279
Thanks, Nick.

19:39.312 --> 19:42.382
Tim, your desk phone
is right... here.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.751
Shall we?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.419
Sure.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.256
(whistles tune)

19:49.289 --> 19:50.590
(taps cards on table)

19:51.624 --> 19:53.260
Deal you in?

19:54.627 --> 19:55.995
Shouldn't you be
searching the ship

19:56.028 --> 19:57.930
for whoever killed my cousin?

19:57.964 --> 20:01.234
We are.
This just helps me think.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.005
You from Maine?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.674
Derry.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.545
Is that by the, uh,

20:12.579 --> 20:13.980
the shipyard up there?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.283
Uh, not really.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.618
Hmm.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.954
You know, you're a lot more
relaxed than your partner.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.324
(chuckles)
He's off his meds.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.692
(chuckles)

20:26.693 --> 20:27.960
So, you're into drones.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.896
Hmm?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.465
Relax. I was looking
at the faculty Web site.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.301
It's in your bio.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.968
Right.

20:36.002 --> 20:39.272
Yeah, I... like gadgets.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.940
You bring one on the ship?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.009
No.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.744
Did Vivian?

20:44.777 --> 20:47.814
I take it back.
You're worse than your partner.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.717
At least he didn't lie
about interrogating me.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.951
Queen of hearts.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.820
What?
That was my nickname.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.323
'Cause I used to play cards
every day in the mess.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.657
I thought it
was a good way

20:57.690 --> 20:59.392
to get to know someone
without all the pressure.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.061
Unless we were playing for cash;
then... (clicks tongue)

21:02.094 --> 21:03.730
Why are you
telling me all this?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.031
To prove I don't lie.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.434
And this wasn't
an interrogation

21:07.467 --> 21:08.935
until you just made it one.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.870
So now instead of
a friendly conversation,

21:10.903 --> 21:13.072
I'm gonna have to ask you
some cold questions.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.407
No.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.310
I want a lawyer.
Mm.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.715
That's too bad. You beat me.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.885
ABBY: So, is drone street
racing, like, a real thing?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.420
No idea.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.489
But McGee owes me big.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.060
So, how did you
expertly fly a drone?

21:34.093 --> 21:35.628
I'm athletic?

21:35.662 --> 21:37.697
Hey, by the way,
uh, Stewart Baxter

21:37.730 --> 21:39.732
is upstairs waiting on his car.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.468
I'm almost done.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.536
You know, they stopped Stewie
at the front gate

21:43.570 --> 21:45.738
when he realized he didn't have
his driver's license.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.006
Claims it must have
been stolen.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.376
That explains how our imposter
got on the ship.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.977
Yeah, normally, I wouldn't
believe the guy, but...

21:51.010 --> 21:53.380
he seems real afraid
of his little sister.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.781
So, he says

21:54.814 --> 21:56.349
he missed the Tiger cruise

21:56.383 --> 21:58.485
because he had to get
his radiator replaced?

21:58.518 --> 22:01.488
Yeah. And his Navy sis
doesn't believe him.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.923
Do we?
Yes... and no.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.361
Whoever told him

22:08.395 --> 22:11.364
that they replaced the radiator
on his car, they lied.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.366
This is just, like,
a cheapo fix-it job.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.802
But because they left
the old radiator in place,

22:15.835 --> 22:17.404
I can see the damage.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.638
So the car trouble
was real?

22:18.671 --> 22:20.407
Oh, yeah. It's more than real.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.908
The puncture holes

22:21.941 --> 22:24.110
in the radiator,
they're perfect circles.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.879
Like, exactly the same size
as a screwdriver.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.581
So it's sabotage.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.016
Someone purposely made sure

22:30.049 --> 22:31.918
he did not get on
the U.S.S. Hoover.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.061
Y-Yo, Ty!

22:42.094 --> 22:43.129
Which way out?

22:43.162 --> 22:44.664
What are you doing?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.433
They said
to start packing.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.167
We're "moving port,"
or something.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.103
We still got to get
through the channel.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.740
A ship this big can't exactly
do it fast and dirty.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.475
It'll be a while.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.577
Don't say anything, Kasey.
I can speak for myself.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.813
I told these cops everything
we know, which is nothing.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.082
I asked to speak
to Miss Powers.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.684
And here she is.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.519
And silent
she will stay.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.121
I'm also her lawyer.
Double the commission.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.090
Curt, can we...
She sent that tweet
as a joke.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.992
She didn't see anything;
she doesn't know anything.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.027
KASEY:
I'm really sorry.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.163
If I had known that someone
was actually dead...
All right, that's enough.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.999
Unless you have reason
to implicate my client,

23:20.032 --> 23:21.133
we're done.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.470
You'll be the first to know.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.937
Big fan.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.773
I like your jacket.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.675
You get more than
fashion tips?

23:28.708 --> 23:30.209
Yeah. Claustrophobia.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.778
I thought you liked
being afloat.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.179
Well, the carrier
was bigger,

23:33.212 --> 23:35.515
and I didn't have to
deal with a murder.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.450
Search team.
Yeah, okay.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.985
On every deck
looking for anything

23:39.018 --> 23:41.454
that could have been smuggled
on board by a drone.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.490
But nothing yet.
Imposter.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.493
Uh, same. While not as big
as the carrier I was on,

23:46.526 --> 23:48.160
it's still as big
as a city block.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.629
Yeah, but we don't have
that kind of time.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.898
Well, we could ask
for some more.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.734
You ask. Your turn.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.504
MAN (over radio):
Captain, pilot tender's
on approach, port side.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.906
Explain to me why I should sail
this ship around in a circle,

23:59.939 --> 24:01.207
putting everybody
at greater risk.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.976
Ma'am, listen, if we
just had more time...

24:04.010 --> 24:06.212
This is not one of
your card games.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.615
The safety of my crew,
their friends and their families

24:08.648 --> 24:10.182
is my only priority.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.985
And I want them into the safety
of that harbor ASAP.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.487
There's a killer on board.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.122
Yes, and we've
caught him--

24:16.155 --> 24:18.090
just in a really
big mousetrap.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.728
And if we dock, you're giving
the mouse exactly what he wants.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.496
Which is?
A way off.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.998
I... Look, the closer
we get to land,

24:26.032 --> 24:28.000
the more options he has.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.136
MAN (over radio):
U.S.S. Hoover,

24:30.169 --> 24:31.604
you are cleared
to enter the channel

24:31.638 --> 24:33.806
on approach
to Naval Station Norfolk.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.008
You are currently
fourth in line.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.243
Copy that. Thank you.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.512
Please, just
another 24 hours.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.581
You have two.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.149
Norfolk, we're
coming home.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.663
Blunt force trauma to the head.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.932
It matches the size and
shape of that pistol.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.234
So someone confronts our victim
in the trash room,

25:02.268 --> 25:05.538
hits her over the head,
and then... dumps the body.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.306
The brain swells,

25:07.339 --> 25:09.776
eventually causing death.
The body is then

25:09.809 --> 25:12.111
accidentally compacted on top
of a drone remote control,

25:12.144 --> 25:14.747
which may or may not be
connected to the murder,

25:14.781 --> 25:17.650
which may or may not be
connected to an imposter,

25:17.684 --> 25:20.620
who is now somehow missing
on board the ship.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.656
But let's be honest--
it's probably all connected.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.993
You're coming dangerously close
to conjecture, Mr. Palmer.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.995
Which we leave
to others.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.329
Yes, Doctor.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.666
Don't let your time on that ship
go to your head.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.702
(sighs)
It already did.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.103
How so?

25:37.136 --> 25:38.805
The helicopter ride home.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.140
I was supposed to take that
motion sickness medication

25:41.173 --> 25:44.010
30 minutes prior
to liftoff, but...

25:44.043 --> 25:46.212
I was so wrapped up
in the case, I...

25:46.245 --> 25:47.580
I forgot.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.216
Doctor, I threw up.

25:50.249 --> 25:53.653
All over the evidence bags
that Gibbs sent with me.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.623
I'm so sorry. I embarrassed you.
I embarrassed this whole office.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.057
Far from it.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.027
Not withstanding our
respective vomit, Mr. Palmer,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.262
we continue to do our jobs.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.798
That's all anyone can ask of us.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.700
Well, thank you, Doctor.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.602
With that in mind,

26:09.636 --> 26:11.370
I'm going to go take

26:11.403 --> 26:13.372
the victim's personal
effects up to Abby.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.609
Yes, I'd take them up myself,
but she still thinks I'm sick,

26:16.643 --> 26:19.812
despite the fact
that I have kept dry toast down

26:19.846 --> 26:21.380
for 24 hours.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.650
Did we miss something?

26:23.683 --> 26:25.718
The victim's necklace.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.287
I didn't notice it
when I removed it,

26:28.320 --> 26:31.390
but... there's
an inscription on the back.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.827
"Time with you is never wasted."

26:34.861 --> 26:36.629
Must be a family heirloom.

26:36.663 --> 26:40.399
Now it's a reminder
of a young life cut short.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.235
ABBY:
I will get whoever did this.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.137
McGEE: It was probably Gibbs.
You know he likes

26:45.171 --> 26:46.405
to be thorough at crime scenes.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.807
No, no, no, it's
not the garbage,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.709
it was the puke that
was on the garbage.

26:49.742 --> 26:50.743
Uh, ew.
Yeah.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.879
Jimmy said it wasn't him,
but who else do you know

26:52.912 --> 26:54.814
that eats graham crackers
and cottage cheese?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.749
That why you called me
down here?
No.

27:02.054 --> 27:06.058
I wanted to tell you
that Bishop showed me the ring.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.694
Oh, good. What'd you think?
How'd I do?

27:07.727 --> 27:08.928
Are you kidding me?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.063
It is... perfect.

27:11.097 --> 27:14.867
And so is your D.C.
solar-symmetrical proposal.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.303
You're so romantic.
Thanks. Thanks, Abbs.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.939
So, is that it, then?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.240
Oh, you know me
better than that.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.909
What do you got, Abbs?

27:22.942 --> 27:26.178
I have sifted through
much trash in my tenure,

27:26.212 --> 27:29.281
but I have never sifted
through these babies.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.718
Birthed from
a plastic processor.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.186
All plastic is separated,
compacted and transported

27:34.220 --> 27:35.788
to the base for recycling.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.756
Yep.

27:36.789 --> 27:40.059
Except one disk had
more than plastic in it.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.131
It's our missing drone.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.866
It's been in the trash
the whole time.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.802
It was just in a different
trash bin than our dead body.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.704
It's beyond repair,
but that didn't stop me

27:51.738 --> 27:52.571
from harvesting
its organs.

27:52.604 --> 27:55.174
Tell me it had a camera.
It had a camera.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.276
And it's detachable,
meaning that you can detach it

27:57.309 --> 27:59.111
and use it
to walk around the ship.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.980
Lot of cameras
on the Tiger cruise.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.348
There are.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.351
But this one was used...

28:08.387 --> 28:10.356
In a restricted area.
Yep.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.958
Well, why?
How'd they get access?

28:11.991 --> 28:13.092
Keep watching.

28:14.794 --> 28:18.364
It's one of the perks
of being famous.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.999
VIP access.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.701
(knock on door)

28:24.436 --> 28:26.305
What the hell?
You just can't barge in here.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.174
GIBBS: We just did.
This is a private room!

28:28.207 --> 28:29.375
There's no such thing

28:29.408 --> 28:30.476
in the Navy.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.511
What's going on?

28:32.544 --> 28:34.814
Well, you wanted to know
when we had probable cause.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.016
Guess what.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.887
GIBBS:
You were in a restricted area.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.321
Don't say anything, Kasey.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.823
Enough, Curt.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.091
Stop talking.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.458
QUINN: Why won't
you let her speak?

28:46.492 --> 28:47.960
What are you two hiding?

28:51.864 --> 28:53.900
I have polyps.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.870
On my vocal cords.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.972
Curt is actually
looking out for me.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.841
I had surgery on them
last week,

29:01.874 --> 29:04.010
and I can't sing for
the next few months.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.913
Hence the goodwill tour.
My idea.

29:06.946 --> 29:09.115
Why stay cooped up
when I can be raising awareness

29:09.148 --> 29:10.316
for the military?

29:10.349 --> 29:13.085
My grandfather was
in the Navy. And...

29:13.119 --> 29:16.455
"murder boat" aside,
the response has been huge.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.257
CURT: If you insist
on talking, maybe just...

29:18.290 --> 29:19.992
whisper.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.028
The Navy wanted us
in those areas

29:22.061 --> 29:24.496
so I could talk about
it on social media.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.166
Millennial recruits
love touchscreens and gizmos.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.801
But anything
that was sensitive

29:28.835 --> 29:32.304
was turned off or removed
before we went in.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.940
CURT: We weren't
the ones filming.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.908
There were other Tigers
in that tour group.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.176
Who was with you?

29:37.209 --> 29:38.544
I didn't take attendance.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.189
Hey, would you ask Superman
to do your taxes?

29:50.222 --> 29:52.925
Um...
Or LeBron James

29:52.959 --> 29:54.526
to babysit your kid?
Would you do that?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.896
Yeah, I bet he's
good with kids.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.064
You do understand
my point, right?

29:58.097 --> 29:59.866
No. Does it have
something to do

29:59.899 --> 30:01.467
with why you're using
McGee's computer?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.836
Yeah. He asked me to input

30:03.870 --> 30:06.906
the names from the ship's
manifest into the system.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.508
So if anything pops up,
then we get an alert.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.077
Oh. That's a good idea.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.311
Yeah, it's a fantastic idea,

30:12.344 --> 30:15.081
except it's a misusage
of my superpowers.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.482
Which are...?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.584
Kicking down doors,
breaking through windows.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.319
The tango.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.054
Oh. Of course.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.957
First I'm flying a drone,
and now I am typing.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.425
McGee's ring is
giving him nightmares

30:26.458 --> 30:28.427
and is turning me
into a... geek.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.263
Well, you're not gonna like
my master plan for it.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.866
Oh, no, Bishop. You're not
keeping that ring here.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.601
I am gonna keep it here.
Oh, come on.

30:35.634 --> 30:36.869
Locked in a desk drawer.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.404
McGee's not gonna like that.

30:38.437 --> 30:42.008
This is a secure
federal building,

30:42.041 --> 30:44.143
swarming with vetted agents.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.246
What better way
to keep it secret?

30:47.279 --> 30:49.648
To keep it safe. Hmm?

30:49.681 --> 30:52.318
No, no, no, you can't keep the
ring in here. Are you crazy?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.954
It will be out of
sight, out of mind.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.522
Out of mind?
I've broken into this desk

30:56.555 --> 30:58.925
a million times before;
that's not safe.

30:58.958 --> 31:02.661
With Kate and Ziva before,
obviously. Not with you.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.996
Can we discuss this?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.631
No. We have a lead right now.

31:05.664 --> 31:06.966
It's actually yours, Torres.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.367
Do you want to
put it up, or...

31:08.400 --> 31:10.436
Oh, hell no.
You do you, boo-boo.

31:10.469 --> 31:13.305
Following up on Stewart Baxter's
stolen driver's license,

31:13.339 --> 31:14.673
I requested security footage

31:14.706 --> 31:17.876
from his gym
the night he had car trouble.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.183
That's our
driver's license thief.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.888
And his face is in our system.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.959
Who the hell is Wayne Cribbage?

31:34.026 --> 31:34.927
Hey.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.195
That our BOLO?

31:36.228 --> 31:38.697
Copies are being distributed
all over the ship.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.399
It's the dad we saw
asking for an autograph.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.969
Not our dad--
an imposter.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.570
Yeah, he has a history
of trespassing

31:44.603 --> 31:45.938
and aggravated assault.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.074
Still doesn't give us
a motive for murder.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.542
Let's find him and ask.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.978
(alarm blaring)

31:52.011 --> 31:53.645
What, did we win a prize?

31:53.679 --> 31:55.647
WOMAN (over speakers):
Man overboard, man overboard,

31:55.681 --> 31:57.083
starboard side.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.584
Sweep that lamp aft!

31:58.617 --> 32:01.320
Contact Port Authority,
get that boat moving!

32:01.353 --> 32:03.155
GIBBS: Commander!
Tow petty officers

32:03.189 --> 32:05.157
saw a man jump,
then lost him in the dark.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.458
Mid-30s, small build?

32:06.492 --> 32:08.260
Could be.
Cribbage is on the run.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.996
REY: We're almost to the pier;
he can make it to land.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.263
Which means he can get away.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.374
(urgent chatter)

32:22.408 --> 32:24.243
What's going on now?

32:24.276 --> 32:26.145
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

32:26.178 --> 32:29.181
Just to be clear, I wasn't wrong
so much as you were right.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.150
But base security
has been alerted.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.352
They'll find your man.
We'd rather we did,
Commander.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.753
Call it the
house advantage.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.989
There's a search helo
about to take off.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.290
You better hurry.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.460
Whoa!

32:41.493 --> 32:42.728
Yo, Ty, man, this
thing ain't no joke!

32:42.761 --> 32:45.097
Where'd you get
that hardhat?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.465
Get to the muster station.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.300
And miss watching you
bust heads in that thing?

32:48.334 --> 32:51.437
Yo, man, you didn't tell me
you guys had all this stuff.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.108
Yo, this Tiger cruise
is lit, son!

33:04.483 --> 33:06.452
(panting)

33:15.761 --> 33:17.796
(quietly):
Yes! Yes!

33:17.829 --> 33:19.465
(panting)

33:21.067 --> 33:22.434
QUINN:
Freeze! NCIS!

33:22.468 --> 33:24.136
Put your hands up.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.371
No!

33:25.404 --> 33:28.140
No.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.576
QUINN: So, why don't you tell us
why you boarded the ship

33:30.609 --> 33:34.480
as Stewart Baxter and
filmed classified areas.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.315
I didn't.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.584
I mean, I did.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.419
I did. But that's
not why I did it.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.421
(laughing): It's not like
I was trying to sell

33:42.454 --> 33:44.290
Navy secrets or anything.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.424
What's so funny?

33:45.457 --> 33:47.193
Nothing.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.760
Uh, I'm cold.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.399
You illegally boarded
a Navy vessel,

33:53.432 --> 33:55.601
and you killed
a decorated officer.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.403
I didn't kill anybody.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.839
That's a long swim
for an innocent man.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.241
I'm not innocent.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.276
Of the imposter stuff.

34:04.310 --> 34:07.279
Stewart worked out
at my gym.

34:07.313 --> 34:10.082
Heard him bragging about
the Tiger cruise, so I...

34:10.116 --> 34:12.151
I messed with his car,
I took his I.D.,

34:12.184 --> 34:13.785
but I didn't do it
for evil purposes.

34:13.819 --> 34:17.089
Oh, you broke the law
for what, charity?

34:17.123 --> 34:18.424
Photographs.

34:18.457 --> 34:20.259
And exclusive video

34:20.292 --> 34:21.427
of Kasey freakin' Powers.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.462
You're a paparazzo?

34:23.495 --> 34:26.432
Most people don't know
the singular noun.

34:28.767 --> 34:33.805
Usually, I got to fight 20 other
media outlets for a shot.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.242
Okay? But on that ship,
it would've just been me.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.876
Could've been worth
ten grand.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.612
And... if I could've got
an aerial drone shot

34:40.646 --> 34:43.482
as we were getting off
in Norfolk...

34:43.515 --> 34:45.684
Hello! Iconic!

34:45.717 --> 34:47.653
"Art" is not an alibi.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.522
I'm using the trash room

34:50.556 --> 34:53.625
to attach the camera
to the drone for my big finale.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.594
FYI-- there is zero privacy

34:55.627 --> 34:56.862
on these Navy ships.

34:56.895 --> 35:00.432
I heard some people coming, so
I-I tossed the stuff and I hid.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.201
You tossed your stuff
in the trash?

35:02.234 --> 35:04.503
I panicked. I was gonna
come back for it, but this...

35:04.536 --> 35:05.871
man and woman came in arguing.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.506
What were they arguing about?

35:07.539 --> 35:08.740
I didn't catch that.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.543
I'm a photographer,
not a journalist, so...

35:11.577 --> 35:12.744
So you saw the murder?

35:12.778 --> 35:14.880
Yes. Okay?
The fight escalated.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.849
The man hit the woman
with... a thing.

35:17.883 --> 35:19.551
And then he dumped her body.

35:19.585 --> 35:20.852
And you saw his face?

35:21.887 --> 35:23.922
No, he didn't catch that.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.525
See? This is why
I didn't want to come forward.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.926
As soon as the killer
left the room,

35:27.959 --> 35:29.428
I got the hell out of there.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.896
All my images
were on that camera.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.598
I lost everything.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.766
I didn't even get an autograph.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.639
If he's not our murderer,
we're still missing something.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.242
Yeah, a big something.
You think?

35:43.942 --> 35:45.477
Look...

35:45.511 --> 35:47.546
there's five agents here!

35:47.579 --> 35:49.648
Somebody give me something.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.217
(computer beeps)

35:52.418 --> 35:53.585
McGee for the save?

35:53.619 --> 35:56.788
Depends. Did you guys talk
to a Merrick Gomer on the ship?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.757
We spoke to a lot of people.
Why?

35:58.790 --> 36:00.559
Restraining order
just appeared in the system,

36:00.592 --> 36:01.660
citing his alcohol abuse

36:01.693 --> 36:02.861
and domestic violence.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.630
That's the mooch.
He was using

36:04.663 --> 36:07.233
a clueless Navy buddy
to hitch a ride to Norfolk.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.401
McGEE: Where his ex-wife and
six-year-old son live on base.

36:09.435 --> 36:10.869
She's a Navy lieutenant
and the one

36:10.902 --> 36:12.804
who filed the order
three days ago, boss.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.606
Security would never let Gomer
through the front gate

36:14.640 --> 36:16.308
if it was official record.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.477
He's using the Tiger
cruise as a back door.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.778
QUINN:
Hoover already docked.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.213
Gomer's already off that ship.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.349
All right, let's go.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.617
Are you sure this is okay?
When Brock's mom went to work,

36:25.651 --> 36:27.953
she didn't say anything
about you coming to pick him up.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.689
I talked to her before we went
to the house. It's no problem.

36:30.722 --> 36:31.690
Dad, where are we going?

36:31.723 --> 36:32.991
Oh, on a trip, buddy.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.426
Where?
It's a surprise.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.761
I'm gonna have
to call her, okay?

36:35.794 --> 36:37.263
Sure. That's fine.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.331
All right, Brock,
we got to hurry.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.267
(line ringing)

36:41.300 --> 36:42.968
Is it the zoo?
Or Busch Gardens?

36:43.001 --> 36:44.670
We'll see, buddy.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.778
It must be something
really special.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.680
Sure is.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.517
Is it Disney World?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.287
No. Not Disney World.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.422
You're done, Merrick.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.690
It's over.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.228
No, you don't want to do that.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.568
Not like this.
Not in front of him.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.271
Is your name Brock?

37:19.305 --> 37:20.506
Yes.
Hey, Brock.

37:20.539 --> 37:23.775
I'm Agent Gibbs. I'm gonna talk
to your dad for a minute.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.711
Can you stop talking to my son?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.913
He missed you, Brock.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.616
That's why he picked
you up this morning.

37:30.649 --> 37:34.019
He was afraid he wasn't gonna
get a chance to see you again.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.822
Which is why he's gonna
come with me right now,

37:36.855 --> 37:40.626
to make sure that he has
a chance to see you after this.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.796
(quietly):
Put your hands on the wheel.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.770
I love you, buddy.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.872
All right?
You remember that, okay?

37:53.905 --> 37:55.741
Out of the car.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.880
(helicopter passing)

38:05.116 --> 38:06.718
So, Brock...
(handcuffs clicking)

38:06.752 --> 38:08.019
your mom's coming
to get you.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.489
What do you want to
do while we wait?

38:10.522 --> 38:11.490
Get a cup of coffee?

38:13.459 --> 38:14.993
(laughs):
Cool.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.432
This is the man
who killed Vivian?

38:20.466 --> 38:22.033
She recognized him
on the ship.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.969
Turns out she was friends
with his ex-wife.

38:24.002 --> 38:27.573
She knew Merrick was denied
visitation rights last year,

38:27.606 --> 38:30.075
was gonna report him.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.943
She was killed trying to do
the right thing.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.813
That sounds like Vee.

38:37.849 --> 38:40.018
(crying)

38:42.588 --> 38:44.823
Sorry, we were
just, um...

38:44.856 --> 38:46.692
(sniffles)

38:46.725 --> 38:47.793
We were close.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.894
Yes.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.363
Much closer than
you're telling us.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.499
Huh?
We know.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.534
You two weren't
cousins.

38:55.567 --> 38:56.568
You were dating.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.540
Yes.

39:01.573 --> 39:03.809
After we spoke,
I kept digging,

39:03.842 --> 39:06.412
and I found
the receipt for this.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.687
Why didn't you just tell us?

39:15.721 --> 39:18.023
'Cause I didn't want Vivian's
last act as an officer

39:18.056 --> 39:19.558
to be a lie.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.860
She loved the Navy.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.862
I just wanted to experience
that part of her life.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.697
McGEE:
You know there are day cruises

39:25.731 --> 39:27.766
for significant others.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.068
There wasn't one of those
for another six months.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.406
I talked her into this.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.077
It shouldn't go on her record.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.615
Think we're gonna let
this one slide.

39:43.649 --> 39:46.051
Thank you.

39:46.084 --> 39:49.921
Knowing that this was
our last time together,

39:49.955 --> 39:52.791
I don't have
any regrets.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.926
Well, except one.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.728
(clears throat)

39:56.762 --> 39:59.164
That I gave her a necklace
instead of a ring.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.635
You know what I mean?

40:07.105 --> 40:08.940
I do.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.776
Quinn, can you finish up?

40:10.809 --> 40:11.943
I...

40:11.977 --> 40:13.812
got to go.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.448
Everything okay?

40:22.954 --> 40:24.923
Oh, boy. What now?

40:24.956 --> 40:26.825
Hey! That's...

40:28.794 --> 40:30.796
...actually super cool.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.499
TORRES: Oh, thank God.
Take that thing out of here

40:33.532 --> 40:36.868
before I start playing Yahtzee
or doing math.

40:37.903 --> 40:38.870
(elevator bell dings)

40:38.904 --> 40:40.038
Hi, Tim!

40:40.071 --> 40:42.541
Delilah. You're here.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.510
Yeah, I figured since I...
Actually, you know what?

40:44.543 --> 40:45.210
Never mind.

40:45.243 --> 40:46.745
This works, too. Excuse us.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.747
(chuckles)

40:48.780 --> 40:49.981
Uh, what works?

40:50.015 --> 40:52.017
(elevator bell dings)

40:55.020 --> 40:56.087
Whoa.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.956
Um, are you allowed to do that?

40:57.989 --> 40:58.957
Sorry.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.893
I had this whole thing planned

41:01.927 --> 41:04.162
with light and symmetry, but
then we had this case come in

41:04.195 --> 41:06.031
with a trash compactor
and kissing cousins,

41:06.064 --> 41:07.766
but they weren't
really cousins.
Tim...

41:09.267 --> 41:11.670
I can't waste any more time.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.009
Delilah...

41:20.912 --> 41:22.748
...will you marry me?

41:25.150 --> 41:26.852
Yes.
