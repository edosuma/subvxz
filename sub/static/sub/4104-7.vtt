00:03.438 --> 00:05.356
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.523 --> 00:07.317
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.483 --> 00:10.403
<i>or breathed real air
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.237 --> 00:12.238
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:13.031 --> 00:15.033
<i>For three generations,
the Ark has kept</i>

00:15.199 --> 00:17.201
<i>what's left of the human race alive.</i>

00:17.368 --> 00:19.412
<i>But now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.579 --> 00:22.373
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.540 --> 00:25.668
<i>One hundred prisoners sent
on a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:26.377 --> 00:28.504
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.671 --> 00:30.840
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:31.007 --> 00:33.926
<i>All we have to do is survive,
but we will be tested</i>

00:34.093 --> 00:36.638
<i>by the Earth,
by the secrets it hides,</i>

00:37.639 --> 00:39.432
<i>and most of all, by each other.</i>

00:41.392 --> 00:42.727
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:42.894 --> 00:44.812
Tell me Finn
didn't make this for you.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.689
<i>Tell me you weren't
screwing my boyfriend.</i>

00:48.358 --> 00:49.692
I can't tell you that.

00:49.859 --> 00:51.611
Life support on the Ark is failing.

00:51.778 --> 00:54.030
In 12 hours, 320 people

00:54.197 --> 00:56.574
will be sacrificed
to boost our oxygen supply.

00:56.741 --> 00:59.327
<i>It'll appear to be a malfunction
of the fire containment system.</i>

00:59.494 --> 01:02.789
<i>Then we hereby commit
these souls to the deep.</i>

01:09.754 --> 01:11.589
Thank you.
You saved my life.

01:12.632 --> 01:13.925
What the hell are you doing?

01:16.719 --> 01:17.762
Octavia.

01:21.974 --> 01:24.769
- Clarke!
- Finn? Oh, my God.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.981
- Hold it down!
- I got it.

01:33.027 --> 01:36.781
This is Raven Reyes
calling Ark Station.

01:38.449 --> 01:40.785
Come in, Ark Station.

01:42.412 --> 01:46.124
This is Raven Reyes
calling Ark Station.

01:46.290 --> 01:48.292
Please, come in.

01:48.459 --> 01:51.587
Please. Can anyone hear me?

01:51.754 --> 01:53.874
- Sure you have the right frequency?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:53.965 --> 01:56.384
Raven? You can do this.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.553
Okay?

02:02.056 --> 02:04.225
Calling Ark Station.

02:11.649 --> 02:13.651
Ark Station, please come in.

02:13.818 --> 02:15.319
I'm on the ground with the hundred.

02:17.613 --> 02:18.614
We need you.

02:23.786 --> 02:27.957
Theft of medical supplies.
Illegal salvaging.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.002
Unauthorized ship launch.

02:32.128 --> 02:34.964
Pirating the Ark comm systems.

02:35.131 --> 02:38.676
Each of these crimes
is punishable by death.

02:40.011 --> 02:41.888
But that will not be your fate today.

02:44.015 --> 02:45.808
- What is that?
- Never mind.

02:45.975 --> 02:49.103
It was argued convincingly

02:49.270 --> 02:52.148
that your medical
expertise is still required.

02:53.983 --> 02:55.818
- Thank you.
- It wasn't me.

02:57.695 --> 02:59.906
The council vote
was nearly unanimous.

03:00.072 --> 03:01.824
Apparently, Jake's message

03:01.991 --> 03:04.118
woke their better angels, as well.

03:07.371 --> 03:08.581
Not so fast.

03:08.748 --> 03:10.374
We need to talk about those flares.

03:10.541 --> 03:12.168
No. We don't.

03:12.335 --> 03:16.297
You saw them, too. We can't just
ignore what we all know it means.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.716
- We don't know what it means.
- It means...

03:18.883 --> 03:20.760
...that there is someone
alive on Earth.

03:20.927 --> 03:22.929
It means that our children
might still be alive.

03:24.388 --> 03:27.099
More false hope.

03:28.893 --> 03:31.354
Abby, those flashes
could've been anything.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.815
Lightning.
Radiation in the atmosphere.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.692
In any case, whatever they were,

03:36.859 --> 03:38.736
that's a matter
for the council to discuss.

03:38.903 --> 03:41.113
And you are no longer on the council.

03:46.077 --> 03:47.578
Your life has been spared...

03:49.413 --> 03:53.417
...but you've been stripped of your seat
at this table, effective immediately.

03:53.584 --> 03:55.044
Your pin.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.594
There it is again.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.891
<i>Calling Ark Station.</i>

04:09.058 --> 04:12.103
<i>Come... to Ark... Station.</i>

04:12.270 --> 04:14.981
Raven. She's still alive.

04:15.147 --> 04:16.274
<i>Are you there?</i>

04:18.233 --> 04:20.444
<i>Please come in.</i>

04:21.320 --> 04:23.823
<i>Please, calling Ark Station.</i>

04:23.990 --> 04:26.868
<i>The hundred are alive.</i>

04:27.034 --> 04:28.452
Can anyone hear me?

04:28.619 --> 04:31.914
<i>This is a restricted channel.
Who is this? Please identify yourself.</i>

04:32.081 --> 04:35.209
This is Raven Reyes.
I'm from Mecha Station.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.045
I'm transmitting from the ground.

04:38.212 --> 04:41.716
The hundred are alive.
Please, you need to get Dr. Abby Griffin.

04:41.883 --> 04:43.885
Dr. Abby Griffin. Now.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.220
Hang on, Raven.
We're trying to boost your signal.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.556
Get her off the Ark-wide channel.
This room only. Copy?

04:49.432 --> 04:51.893
- Can she hear me?
- Did you confirm the signal's origin?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.978
Yes, sir. It's coming from Earth.

04:59.317 --> 05:01.986
Raven. Are you there?

05:05.448 --> 05:06.741
Mom?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.660
Mom, it's me.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.373
Clarke?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.839
Mom, I need your help.

05:22.006 --> 05:23.726
One of our people
was stabbed by a Grounder.

05:25.343 --> 05:28.346
Clarke, this is the chancellor.

05:28.512 --> 05:30.432
Are you saying
there are survivors on the ground?

05:30.473 --> 05:31.682
Yes.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.144
The Earth is survivable.
We're not alone.

05:39.732 --> 05:42.985
Mom, he's dying.
The knife's still in his chest.

05:43.152 --> 05:45.321
- Can you patch me through to medical?
- Of course.

05:47.531 --> 05:49.825
Clarke, is my son with you?

05:54.997 --> 05:55.998
I'm so sorry.

05:58.751 --> 06:01.545
Wells is... Wells is dead.

06:14.850 --> 06:18.270
Clarke needs you. Patch her
in to me when they're finished.

06:24.402 --> 06:27.029
<i>I'm gonna talk
you through it step by step.</i>

06:30.700 --> 06:33.744
<i>Clarke, just five
to get to medical. Medic...</i>

06:33.911 --> 06:35.746
What?

06:35.913 --> 06:39.834
- Raven, what's wrong?
- It's not the radio. It's the storm.

06:41.127 --> 06:43.462
Dr. Griffin,
you should look at this.

06:43.629 --> 06:45.229
There's a hurricane
right on top of them.

06:45.381 --> 06:47.258
Clarke, we need to hurry.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.812
Ugh!

07:00.062 --> 07:02.857
- Monty's moonshine?
- Pretty sure no germ can survive it.

07:04.108 --> 07:05.192
Storm's getting worse.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.820
- Monroe, close the doors.
- We still have people out there.

07:07.987 --> 07:10.197
Monty and Jasper
still aren't back yet.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.074
- Neither is Bellamy.
- It's all right.

07:12.241 --> 07:14.285
They'll find somewhere
to ride it out.

07:15.619 --> 07:17.329
- One suture needle.
- Right.

07:17.496 --> 07:19.136
I still need something
to close the wound.

07:19.165 --> 07:21.059
There's some wire on the second level.
I use it for tents.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.561
- Let's see it.
- Stay away from the blue wires

07:22.585 --> 07:23.745
that run through the ceiling.

07:23.794 --> 07:25.474
I rigged it to the solar cells
in the roof.

07:25.504 --> 07:27.664
- That means they're hot. Got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.676
Tell me you can do this.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.013
Hey, they're back.

07:34.180 --> 07:35.723
Bellamy.

07:38.017 --> 07:39.185
Grounder?

07:40.603 --> 07:43.272
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's time to get some answers.

07:43.439 --> 07:45.483
- Oh, you mean revenge?
- I mean intel.

07:45.649 --> 07:47.735
- Get him upstairs.
- Bellamy, she's right.

07:47.902 --> 07:51.363
<i>Clarke, honey, we're ready.
Can you hear me?</i>

07:53.991 --> 07:55.785
Look, this is not who we are.

07:55.951 --> 07:57.286
Clarke?

08:00.790 --> 08:01.791
It is now.

08:07.630 --> 08:09.548
The blade is at a sharp upward angle,

08:09.715 --> 08:12.134
<i>- between the sixth and seventh ribs.</i>
- Okay, how deep?

08:12.301 --> 08:14.136
I can't tell how deep it goes.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.474
<i>That's all right.
Just don't remove the knife yet.</i>

08:22.770 --> 08:24.480
Hey, here.
Sterilize your hands.

08:32.696 --> 08:35.366
<i>- Clarke, do you see any fluid?</i>
- Hey, watch it!

08:36.325 --> 08:38.785
Damn it! Clear the room.

08:38.953 --> 08:39.953
Come on!

08:40.121 --> 08:43.207
Everyone, upstairs! Now! Let's go!

08:43.374 --> 08:44.542
He feels a little warm.

08:44.708 --> 08:47.419
<i>Okay. That's all right.
Fever sometimes accompanies trauma.</i>

08:47.586 --> 08:49.296
Clarke, I need you to tell me

08:49.463 --> 08:51.882
if there is any fluid
leaking from the wound.

08:52.550 --> 08:54.218
Uh...

08:54.468 --> 08:55.761
No.

08:55.928 --> 08:57.012
Pleural membrane's intact.

08:57.179 --> 09:00.307
That's good.
Actually, really good. He got lucky.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.936
Hear that? You got lucky.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.110
He's awake.

09:11.277 --> 09:12.736
Tie him tighter.

09:12.903 --> 09:16.365
Last thing we need is this bastard
getting free because you screwed up.

09:25.916 --> 09:27.293
Octavia, get out of here.

09:27.459 --> 09:30.212
I told you he was protecting me.

09:30.379 --> 09:32.006
You didn't have to do this.

09:32.173 --> 09:34.717
This isn't about you.

09:34.884 --> 09:36.051
I'm doing this for all of us.

09:36.218 --> 09:38.179
You did that for all of us?

09:38.345 --> 09:41.515
I did that for Finn and Jasper

09:41.682 --> 09:43.475
And Diggs and John and Roma.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.477
- It wasn't even him.
- You don't know that!

09:47.104 --> 09:48.772
We need to know
what we're up against.

09:48.939 --> 09:51.984
How many there are
and why they're killing us.

09:52.151 --> 09:53.903
And he's gonna tell us right now.

09:54.069 --> 09:56.363
- No, Bellamy, please.
- Miller. Miller, get her out of here.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.157
I was there! I...

09:58.324 --> 10:00.993
Hey, get... Get off of me!

10:05.372 --> 10:06.957
I don't even think he speaks English.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.294
He won't understand you.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.088
Oh, I think he will.

10:50.251 --> 10:53.587
Hello, Mr. Chancellor.
I just need a moment.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.634
If you're here to talk about Abby's
council seat, now is not a good time.

10:56.715 --> 10:58.342
Trust me, you need to hear this.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.893
I remember
these quarters being bigger

11:08.060 --> 11:10.062
when I was chancellor.

11:12.523 --> 11:14.358
What do you want, Diana?

11:15.401 --> 11:16.819
We need to talk.

11:16.986 --> 11:19.196
My people are angry and confused.

11:20.364 --> 11:21.865
Your people?

11:22.032 --> 11:23.909
Yes. The workers.

11:26.245 --> 11:30.082
They're coming to me
with dangerous questions, Thelonious.

11:30.249 --> 11:32.501
Many of them lost loved ones
in the culling.

11:32.668 --> 11:35.379
The belief that your
administration let people die

11:35.546 --> 11:38.048
when there was another way
has taken root.

11:38.215 --> 11:40.843
I don't suppose you're trying
to convince them otherwise.

11:41.010 --> 11:45.806
If you don't get in front of these rumors,
things are gonna get ugly fast.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.477
That's what I would do
in your position.

11:50.644 --> 11:54.064
You're not in my position, Diana.

11:54.231 --> 11:56.525
My people voted you out.

12:03.365 --> 12:05.576
You've activated Project Exodus?

12:10.372 --> 12:11.999
Congratulations.

12:13.292 --> 12:16.003
You will forever
be remembered as the man

12:16.170 --> 12:19.631
who brought us back to the ground.

12:19.798 --> 12:21.675
You know I can't talk
to you about that, Diana.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.887
It's true. We've had our differences.
But I'm here as an ally.

12:25.804 --> 12:28.349
The decisions that you now must make

12:28.515 --> 12:33.062
implementing Project Exodus
are unimaginably difficult.

12:36.774 --> 12:39.485
The Ark needs unity

12:39.651 --> 12:41.779
now more than ever.

12:41.945 --> 12:45.032
I hope that you can trust me enough

12:45.199 --> 12:46.992
to let me help you with that.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.707
I think we have a problem. Look.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.794
If she's just a hair off, she could
lacerate the aorta when she extracts.

13:00.798 --> 13:03.634
Okay, Clarke,
firm grip on the knife.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.887
<i>You're gonna need
to angle it upward and to the left,</i>

13:07.054 --> 13:10.724
<i>very slightly to the left
as it exits the rib cage.</i>

13:10.891 --> 13:12.393
How very slightly?

13:12.559 --> 13:16.397
Three millimeters.
Any more would be bad. Any less, too.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.732
<i>Three mil... Clarke?</i>

13:19.817 --> 13:21.944
Wait, what was that?
You dropped out.

13:22.111 --> 13:25.656
Clarke, three millimeters. Got it?

13:25.823 --> 13:27.741
Yeah. Okay, I got it.

13:29.493 --> 13:31.203
Here goes.

13:31.370 --> 13:34.456
<i>Steady hand. You've assisted
me on trickier procedures than this.</i>

13:34.623 --> 13:36.125
And once that knife is out,

13:36.291 --> 13:38.127
<i>the hard part is over.</i>

13:43.257 --> 13:45.676
All right. Extracting now.

13:50.139 --> 13:52.349
- He's waking up!
- Hold him still.

13:52.516 --> 13:54.396
Finn, I'm gonna get that
knife out of you, okay?

13:54.476 --> 13:55.477
Good plan.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.522
Finn, you can't move.
You got it?

13:58.689 --> 13:59.898
Okay. Here it goes.

14:00.065 --> 14:01.692
<i>Nice and slow, Clarke.</i>

14:01.859 --> 14:03.360
Finn, do not move.

14:03.527 --> 14:06.196
Almost got it. Hold still.

14:16.540 --> 14:17.958
Clarke.

14:21.753 --> 14:23.380
<i>You all right?</i>

14:23.547 --> 14:26.967
<i>Clarke. Clarke? What's happening?</i>

14:28.635 --> 14:30.554
<i>Clarke, can you hear us?</i>

14:31.680 --> 14:33.348
<i>- Clarke?</i>
- It's out.

14:35.225 --> 14:36.727
She did it.

14:53.577 --> 14:55.787
What the hell was that?
We under attack or not?

14:55.954 --> 14:58.040
Storm damage. We're okay.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.627
We're gonna try this one more time.

15:02.753 --> 15:03.795
What's your name?

15:05.923 --> 15:06.924
Where's your camp?

15:07.925 --> 15:09.760
How many of you are there?

15:09.927 --> 15:12.429
Hey. Check it out.

15:18.769 --> 15:20.354
What is all this stuff?

15:20.521 --> 15:21.939
Hell knows with these people.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.947
I think we found something
he doesn't want us to see, Miller.

15:33.325 --> 15:35.118
These aren't bad.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.469
It's our camp.

15:52.636 --> 15:55.264
I'm guessing if I counted all those
marks, it would add up to 102.

15:56.431 --> 15:58.433
And ten are crossed out.

15:59.935 --> 16:01.853
That's how many people we've lost.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.860
They've been watching us
ever since we got here.

16:17.786 --> 16:19.997
Okay. I'm done.

16:20.163 --> 16:22.416
Good. Do you have anything
to cover the wound?

16:22.583 --> 16:24.334
We'll make do, like always.

16:25.961 --> 16:27.879
Should he be this pale? Warm, too.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.381
<i>He's lost a lot of blood, Raven,</i>

16:29.548 --> 16:32.217
but if your boyfriend's
anywhere near as tough as you,

16:32.384 --> 16:34.177
<i>I'm sure he'll be fine.</i>

16:38.849 --> 16:40.851
Wait, Mom, she's right.

16:41.018 --> 16:43.103
He's feverish,
and his breathing's uneven.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.355
<i>Well, you need to give
him some time to recover.</i>

16:45.522 --> 16:47.441
<i>Let me know if he gets
any worse, but I think...</i>

16:47.608 --> 16:49.484
<i>I think he might
just be out of the woods.</i>

16:49.651 --> 16:51.361
Well, down here,
there's nothing but woods.

16:54.406 --> 16:55.407
I need a break.

16:55.574 --> 16:57.284
Clarke? Clarke, wait.

16:57.451 --> 17:01.580
Raven... could you give us
a few minutes?

17:02.539 --> 17:05.166
- Sure.
- No. No. Stay with Finn.

17:09.546 --> 17:11.798
What the hell is that thing?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.634
Friend of yours?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.559
- Get the hell out of my way.
- It's okay. Let her through.

17:32.736 --> 17:34.946
Well, if he didn't hate
us before, he does now.

17:37.074 --> 17:40.118
Who cares? How's Finn?

17:40.285 --> 17:44.414
Alive. His people will care.

17:44.581 --> 17:47.501
How long until
they figure out where he is?

17:47.668 --> 17:49.065
And what happens when they do?

17:49.090 --> 17:51.030
I mean, when they come looking for him?

17:51.055 --> 17:51.862
They will, Bellamy.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.716
Relax, princess.
No one saw us take him.

17:54.883 --> 17:56.885
He was chained up in that cave
the entire time,

17:57.052 --> 18:00.389
and thanks to the storm,
we didn't see a soul on the way back.

18:02.683 --> 18:05.602
Okay. In case you missed it,

18:05.769 --> 18:09.189
his people are already killing us.

18:10.941 --> 18:12.609
How many more
of our people need to die

18:12.776 --> 18:15.362
until you realize
we're fighting a war?

18:15.529 --> 18:18.573
We're not soldiers, Bellamy.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.033
Look at him.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.493
We can't win.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.370
You're right. We can't.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.247
If we don't fight.

18:26.123 --> 18:27.541
Clarke, he's seizing!

18:27.708 --> 18:29.126
On my way.

18:43.974 --> 18:46.174
- He was fine, then...
- Get my mother on the radio now.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.311
- Raven, now!
- The radio's dead!

18:48.478 --> 18:50.313
Interference from the storm.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.233
Please don't let him die.

19:17.215 --> 19:18.884
Is that Kane?

19:19.050 --> 19:20.510
Are you kidding me?

19:33.231 --> 19:35.525
Marcus, you shouldn't be here.

19:37.027 --> 19:38.111
You're wrong, Mom.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.573
This is exactly where I should be.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.075
You've got some balls coming here.

19:45.577 --> 19:46.703
Don't.

19:46.870 --> 19:50.457
You're standing where my wife
took her last breath.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.250
I'm so...

19:54.419 --> 19:55.462
...so very sorry.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.506
Tell me she didn't die for nothing.

19:58.590 --> 20:02.469
If I did... I'd be lying.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.680
Then it's true? You knew
those kids were on the ground?

20:05.847 --> 20:07.641
- Yes.
- That the Earth is survivable?

20:07.808 --> 20:09.017
- No.
- You were supposed

20:09.226 --> 20:10.227
to protect us.

20:13.063 --> 20:15.106
Say something!

20:15.273 --> 20:17.859
Enough! Stand back!

20:18.026 --> 20:19.986
I don't need you to defend me.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.696
Murderers!

20:21.863 --> 20:25.116
Put that away. Don't make this
any worse than it already is.

20:25.283 --> 20:26.493
We want answers.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.537
We want our people back.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.335
The least we can
give you is the truth.

20:36.461 --> 20:39.232
Sound a signal for a general assembly
with the station representatives.

20:39.256 --> 20:41.591
- What are you doing?
- No more secrets.

20:49.766 --> 20:51.017
Give us room.

21:05.323 --> 21:11.246
- You've been drinking?
- Three hundred and twenty people.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.335
If I'd waited a day, two days...

21:20.505 --> 21:23.133
...they'd still be alive.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.218
You didn't make that
decision alone, Marcus.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.053
Maybe not.

21:28.513 --> 21:29.639
But I pushed.

21:31.349 --> 21:33.393
I was... I was so sure.

21:34.144 --> 21:36.646
I swore an oath to protect
and defend these people.

21:38.315 --> 21:39.649
Instead...

21:43.028 --> 21:44.779
...I killed them.

21:47.824 --> 21:49.826
Pull yourself together, Kane.

21:51.453 --> 21:53.371
And then get your ass
to the mess hall.

21:59.794 --> 22:02.756
Okay. It stopped.
Quick, help me get him on his side.

22:03.632 --> 22:05.425
Raven, there is fluid in his lungs.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.052
He could choke. Quick.

22:12.182 --> 22:13.391
God, he's burning up.

22:13.558 --> 22:16.436
Fluid in his lungs. Does that mean
the knife hit something?

22:16.603 --> 22:19.022
This isn't blood.
It's something else. I did...

22:19.189 --> 22:21.691
I did everything she told me.

22:21.858 --> 22:23.109
I've seen this before.

22:23.276 --> 22:24.778
Shortness of breath. Fever.

22:24.945 --> 22:26.404
Seizing. It's poison.

22:26.571 --> 22:29.491
Clarke, you sterilized everything.
I watched you do it.

22:31.159 --> 22:34.037
Not everything. Stay here.

22:38.416 --> 22:41.544
Clarke. They locked the hatch.

22:48.510 --> 22:49.719
Hey!

22:51.137 --> 22:52.222
Open the door!

22:59.521 --> 23:01.731
Get out of my way, Miller. Now!

23:06.987 --> 23:08.827
- What's on this?
- What are you talking about?

23:08.863 --> 23:10.073
He poisoned the blade.

23:10.115 --> 23:12.675
All this time, you knew Finn
was gonna die no matter what we did.

23:12.742 --> 23:14.786
What is it?
Is there an antidote?

23:14.953 --> 23:17.956
- Clarke, he doesn't understand you.
- Vials.

23:19.666 --> 23:20.709
It's gotta be here.

23:22.585 --> 23:24.825
You'd have to be stupid to have
a poison around this long

23:24.963 --> 23:26.881
without an antidote.

23:29.134 --> 23:31.386
Which one?

23:31.553 --> 23:32.637
Answer the question!

23:34.639 --> 23:36.933
Show us. Please.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.268
Which one?

23:38.435 --> 23:41.354
Our friend is dying down there
and you can stop that.

23:47.485 --> 23:49.237
I'll get him to talk.

23:49.404 --> 23:52.449
- Bellamy, no.
- He wants Finn to die.

23:52.615 --> 23:55.035
Why can't you see that?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.536
Do you want him to live or not?

23:59.622 --> 24:02.083
Clarke, you even said it yourself.
This is not who we are!

24:02.834 --> 24:04.836
He was protecting me.
He saved my life.

24:05.003 --> 24:06.838
We're talking about Finn's life.

24:10.592 --> 24:12.510
Do it.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.307
Just tell us!

24:32.197 --> 24:35.116
You're gonna show us the
antidote or you're gonna wish you had.

24:52.175 --> 24:54.594
Bellamy, no. Please.

25:13.988 --> 25:17.700
Please. Which one's the antidote?

25:17.867 --> 25:19.160
Just tell them.

25:24.999 --> 25:26.084
Clarke.

25:40.723 --> 25:42.559
<i>You are the station reps
of the Ark,</i>

25:42.725 --> 25:45.728
and I don't blame you
for losing faith in me.

25:45.895 --> 25:48.398
I kept the Ark's
oxygen crisis from you.

25:49.649 --> 25:52.485
I lied about sending
the hundred to the ground.

25:52.652 --> 25:56.489
But you can tell your stations
that the deception ends here.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.741
You now know the whole truth...

25:59.742 --> 26:03.955
...but there is one truth
that stands above all the rest.

26:04.122 --> 26:08.042
Earth... is survivable.

26:09.752 --> 26:14.799
The 320 souls who sacrificed
their lives in the culling

26:14.966 --> 26:18.219
gifted the rest of us
the time that we need

26:18.386 --> 26:20.096
to make it to the ground.

26:20.263 --> 26:22.724
Mankind is going home.

26:26.394 --> 26:28.521
How do we know that's everything?

26:29.564 --> 26:32.859
How do we know you're not still lying
to cover up for the culling?

26:41.409 --> 26:42.869
This afternoon, I declassified

26:43.036 --> 26:44.746
the minutes of all council meetings.

26:44.913 --> 26:46.581
Is that supposed
to make us feel better?

26:46.748 --> 26:48.291
All those people died for nothing.

26:53.171 --> 26:54.339
Please.

26:56.799 --> 26:58.468
We're all in pain.

26:58.635 --> 27:00.303
No, you don't get to do that.

27:00.470 --> 27:03.556
You pushed the button that sucked
the air out of my wife's lungs.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.976
You caused our pain.
You know nothing about how we feel.

27:07.143 --> 27:10.188
I lost my son!

27:30.500 --> 27:32.043
I didn't know that.

27:34.128 --> 27:35.171
I'm sorry.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.891
My friends, please.

27:47.850 --> 27:52.188
Chancellor Jaha has sacrificed
as much as any of us.

27:53.147 --> 27:56.359
But his loss,
just like all of yours,

27:56.526 --> 27:58.778
is not in vain.

27:59.570 --> 28:01.239
The chancellor's son died

28:01.406 --> 28:06.327
finding out that Earth is survivable.

28:09.747 --> 28:12.542
And because of your wife's sacrifice,

28:12.709 --> 28:16.921
your daughter will get
to come down to the ground.

28:17.088 --> 28:20.216
That is not in vain.

28:20.383 --> 28:21.968
Ma'am, we can't trust them.

28:23.261 --> 28:24.721
I'm sorry.

28:26.556 --> 28:28.224
Then trust her.

28:28.391 --> 28:31.602
As of this morning,
there's an open seat on the council.

28:31.769 --> 28:34.689
Mine to fill until the next election.

28:35.690 --> 28:38.192
We need unity now...

28:40.570 --> 28:42.071
...more than ever.

28:43.781 --> 28:45.783
What do you say, Diana?

29:09.766 --> 29:12.185
- Enough!
<i>- Clarke! He's getting worse!</i>

29:12.352 --> 29:13.853
We're running out of time.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.814
Which one? Which one is it?

29:16.981 --> 29:18.941
If you tell us, they'll stop.

29:19.650 --> 29:22.695
Please tell us which is the antidote
and they'll stop this.

29:32.747 --> 29:35.625
If that doesn't work,
maybe this will.

29:35.792 --> 29:38.294
Clarke, you don't have
to be here for this.

29:38.461 --> 29:40.254
I'm not leaving
until I get that antidote.

29:46.177 --> 29:47.387
Last chance.

30:05.488 --> 30:06.781
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

30:08.616 --> 30:09.951
- He stopped breathing.
- What?

30:10.118 --> 30:11.918
He started again,
but next time, he might not.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.205
He won't tell us anything.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.418
Want to bet?

30:18.584 --> 30:20.670
What are you doing?

30:20.837 --> 30:22.755
Showing him something new.

30:33.516 --> 30:34.642
Which one is it?

30:36.727 --> 30:38.187
Come on!

30:45.236 --> 30:47.238
He's all I have.

30:49.031 --> 30:50.199
No more!

30:50.366 --> 30:51.784
He's letting Finn die.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.082
Octavia, no!

31:01.544 --> 31:02.712
He won't let me die.

31:02.879 --> 31:04.213
Octavia, what the hell did you...

31:06.966 --> 31:08.759
This one?

31:09.844 --> 31:11.095
Huh?

31:16.726 --> 31:17.852
Come on.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.731
Yeah? Yeah?

31:23.566 --> 31:24.942
Is it that one?

31:28.279 --> 31:29.947
- Here.
- Thank you.

31:36.496 --> 31:37.997
Don't touch me.

31:59.268 --> 32:01.270
How do we know if it works?

32:02.104 --> 32:04.106
We'll know when he wakes up.

32:05.274 --> 32:07.568
He'll need water when he does.

32:07.735 --> 32:09.237
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

32:28.839 --> 32:31.259
I can't do this without you.

32:35.304 --> 32:37.431
<i>Hello? Clarke?</i>

32:38.975 --> 32:40.893
<i>Clarke, can you hear me?</i>

32:46.399 --> 32:47.400
I'm here.

32:48.442 --> 32:49.610
Oh, thank God.

32:49.777 --> 32:52.780
<i>The... The storm is passing.</i>

32:56.158 --> 32:57.743
<i>How's Finn doing?</i>

33:00.788 --> 33:02.123
I think he'll be okay.

33:03.165 --> 33:04.625
Well, that's thanks to you.

33:06.294 --> 33:08.337
I'm so proud of you.

33:09.797 --> 33:13.050
Clarke, your father would be
so proud of you, too.

33:20.891 --> 33:23.060
Don't talk about him.

33:24.937 --> 33:27.148
Clarke.

33:27.315 --> 33:29.859
Baby, I know
something else is wrong.

33:30.693 --> 33:32.153
Please tell me what it is.

33:34.196 --> 33:35.615
Dad's dead because of you.

33:37.325 --> 33:39.452
<i>You turned him in. I know it.</i>

33:39.619 --> 33:42.038
Wells told me everything before he...

33:46.334 --> 33:48.252
He let me believe that he did it...

33:49.879 --> 33:52.256
<i>...so that I'd hate him
instead of you.</i>

34:00.473 --> 34:01.766
Clarke...

34:05.061 --> 34:09.315
Clarke, I want you to listen to me.
That was never supposed to happen.

34:10.232 --> 34:12.234
Jaha was supposed
to talk him out of it.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.902
I'm done talking to you.

34:18.866 --> 34:22.453
Clarke. No.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.308
You haven't done that in years.

34:50.606 --> 34:53.525
It's healing.
Don't you agree?

35:05.871 --> 35:07.331
I don't know who I am anymore.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.376
You're my son.

35:13.295 --> 35:15.423
I've done some terrible things.

35:15.589 --> 35:17.258
God will forgive you, Marcus.

35:17.425 --> 35:21.762
The question is, will you
be able to forgive yourself?

35:56.922 --> 35:58.174
Hey.

35:58.340 --> 35:59.675
Look, I need to clean this.

36:02.845 --> 36:04.513
Here.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.015
Let me try.

36:20.237 --> 36:23.532
I never wanted him
to get hurt, Octavia.

36:24.909 --> 36:26.827
You have to know that.

36:28.704 --> 36:30.039
I just wanted to save Finn.

36:31.540 --> 36:34.460
For the record,
you didn't save Finn. That was me.

36:34.627 --> 36:38.714
But whatever you want
to tell yourself to feel better.

36:51.894 --> 36:53.395
I'm so sorry.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.901
You saved my life and look...

36:59.068 --> 37:00.861
Look at the thanks you get.

37:03.739 --> 37:06.242
I never wanted
any of this to happen to you.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.050
Thank you.

37:32.309 --> 37:33.394
Hey.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.649
- He just say something?
- No.

37:38.816 --> 37:42.111
You know your brother doesn't
want you up here, Octavia. Let's go.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.821
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:28.157 --> 38:29.158
Good save.

38:36.874 --> 38:38.334
It wasn't just me.

38:44.006 --> 38:46.050
She needs you, Finn.

38:51.805 --> 38:53.891
Raven. He's awake.

38:54.058 --> 38:55.559
He was asking for you.

39:05.736 --> 39:07.488
I thought I lost you.

39:37.518 --> 39:39.186
We'll get it cleaned up.

39:40.270 --> 39:43.190
I wish this was our only mess.

39:43.357 --> 39:44.566
Clarke.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.865
Who we are
and who we need to be to survive

39:52.032 --> 39:53.909
are very different things.

39:58.330 --> 40:02.126
What are we gonna do with him?
We can't keep him locked up forever.

40:02.292 --> 40:06.046
If we let him go, he'll be back,
and not alone next time.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.511
It's not easy being in charge, is it?

40:26.692 --> 40:29.319
I, Diana Sydney, do solemnly swear

40:29.486 --> 40:33.615
to uphold and defend
the laws and the people of the Ark.

40:35.743 --> 40:39.246
Then, welcome back to the table,
Councilor Sydney.

40:39.413 --> 40:40.414
Thank you.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.711
As a former chancellor,

40:45.878 --> 40:49.798
no one knows more about
Project Exodus than you do.

40:49.965 --> 40:53.677
The good news is
that we are going to the ground.

40:55.054 --> 40:57.556
The bad news is not all of us are.

41:01.643 --> 41:03.812
It's a problem
we were supposed to have

41:03.979 --> 41:05.689
a hundred years to fix.

41:05.856 --> 41:06.857
What problem?

41:09.068 --> 41:13.405
There are 2237 people on this Ark...

41:15.407 --> 41:19.078
...and there are only enough
dropships to carry 700.

41:23.499 --> 41:26.168
We are on the <i>Titanic</i>

41:26.335 --> 41:28.670
and there aren't enough lifeboats.
