00:53.087 --> 00:56.622
- Hey.
- Morning.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.462
- Hap, what is it?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.498
- Oh...

01:06.500 --> 01:08.434
Trudy.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.706
- You think they was trying
to find it on their own?

01:53.413 --> 01:56.348
- I been wondering
the same thing.

02:45.331 --> 02:49.401
This what I hope it is?
Hap?

02:49.403 --> 02:54.473
- There's probably a million
license plates in that river.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.643
- But I got a feeling
about this one...

02:59.212 --> 03:02.281
A real good feeling.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.823
Yeah.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.931
- Leonard! You awake?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.936
Hello!

03:26.673 --> 03:28.707
<i>- The announcement--</i>

03:28.709 --> 03:32.811
<i>I'm not surprised--george bush,
the gop's nomination,</i>

03:32.813 --> 03:35.447
<i>On the republican side, for
president of the United States.</i>

03:35.449 --> 03:38.217
- Leonard!

03:40.286 --> 03:41.920
Len, good morning.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.257
- Is julia childs gonna come
from behind the fridge?

03:45.259 --> 03:48.527
- This is nothing.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.964
I just thought you, uh,
you might be hungry.

03:51.966 --> 03:55.400
Why don't you sit down,
and I'll fix you up a plate?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.236
- What the hell happened
to my mats?

03:57.238 --> 03:58.837
- Oh, they needed
to be washed.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.273
How come you don't use
the ones that I bought you?

04:01.275 --> 04:03.342
They look nice,
don't they?

04:03.344 --> 04:06.578
- Look like rainbow sherbet
threw up on 'em.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.589
- I put--I put cayenne
in the batter already,

04:18.591 --> 04:21.526
Because I know--'cause I know
you like spice.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.795
- Yeah, I like spice.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.332
Can't taste it
unless my ass on fire.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.475
come back, little darlin'

04:36.477 --> 04:41.713
- Why wasn't the spirit
of the '60s sustainable, hap?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.483
- I'm no expert,
but I'm pretty sure

04:44.485 --> 04:46.918
The marijuana might've had
something to do with that.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.820
- I told you he wouldn't
take this seriously.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.723
- You're just slinging
a lot of jazzy words around,

04:51.725 --> 04:54.626
And I haven't even
had a coffee yet.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.562
- You know much
about how corporations work?

04:57.564 --> 04:58.864
- Can't say that I do.

04:58.866 --> 04:59.998
- Howard does.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.633
Howard knows all about it.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.368
- Well, let's say
I had a lot of time

05:03.370 --> 05:05.037
To read up on things inside,

05:05.039 --> 05:07.673
Focusing on their
tactics for success--

05:07.675 --> 05:10.509
Infrastructure, growth,
diversification--

05:10.511 --> 05:13.812
Strategies that were never
truly applied to...

05:13.814 --> 05:14.913
- Canvassing.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.581
- Activism.
- Activism.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.983
- Our movements fell apart
because they weren't

05:17.985 --> 05:22.788
Held together by anything
other than idealism.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.757
- We'll take the money
from the heist

05:25.759 --> 05:27.392
As our seed investment.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.762
That starts the corporation,
so to speak.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.098
We are essentially
its board members.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.767
Our goals will be
as they've always been:

05:35.769 --> 05:37.636
Fighting for equality,

05:37.638 --> 05:39.104
Fighting against the man,

05:39.106 --> 05:42.107
Fighting against corruption.

05:42.109 --> 05:46.411
Only now, we'll have
the means to fight back.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.413
- Yeah, I'm seeing
an octopus

05:48.415 --> 05:53.118
With a-a little triangle hat,
maybe.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.523
- Gee, in case you hadn't
noticed, hap,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.592
Your buddy's not here
right now.

06:00.594 --> 06:04.863
And our appetite for sarcasm
isn't quite as bottomless.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.598
- Oh.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.966
- Hap.
- Hmm?

06:07.968 --> 06:09.601
- You know what makes
the world go round:

06:09.603 --> 06:11.970
Money and connections.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.905
Howard's put in time
all across the u.S.--

06:13.907 --> 06:17.576
Voter outreach,
community organizing, lectures.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.779
Those towns, those people
he's worked with for years,

06:20.781 --> 06:23.148
They'll be our partners.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.752
In jazzy business terms,
that's infrastructure.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.120
- Oh.
- Ten years ago,

06:28.122 --> 06:29.588
Greenpeace was just
a couple of activists

06:29.590 --> 06:31.056
Kicking around
in an old fishing boat

06:31.058 --> 06:33.492
With nothing but
a stack full of flyers.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.761
Look at 'em now.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.131
Who says we can't do that?

06:39.133 --> 06:42.033
- Hey, trudy, you still want me
to take your shift later?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.035
Because earl wants to go
drinking with his buddies,

06:44.037 --> 06:45.837
And I got the baby again.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.539
- That's okay.
I can do that.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.641
- Thanks.
I appreciate it.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.081
- Okay, say--

06:56.083 --> 06:57.783
Say I was interested.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.551
How...

06:59.553 --> 07:03.789
How would I fit in
to all--all of that?

07:05.525 --> 07:09.961
<i>- Read my lips.
No new taxes.</i>

07:11.498 --> 07:13.165
<i>I will keep america
moving forward.</i>

07:13.167 --> 07:17.035
- I really hope this man does
a better job than reagan did.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.539
Bad actor, even worse
of a president.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.942
- The hell you talking about?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.578
Reagan
was a damn good actor.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.947
- How 'bout the movie
he made with the monkey?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.851
- That was ahead of its time.

07:32.853 --> 07:37.823
- No, that was out of touch,
just like reagan.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.626
And you, you're just arguing
for the sake of arguing.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.163
Must run in the family.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.098
- You don't know my family.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.568
- I changed your uncle's bedpan
while you and your boyfriend

07:49.570 --> 07:51.203
Were off building forts
and playing cowboy.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.838
You want to know
what chester was eating

07:52.840 --> 07:54.573
For lunch and dinner,
leonard?

07:54.575 --> 07:59.511
Cat food.
That's how he was living.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.112
- I didn't know.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.915
- Of course you didn't,
because he pushed you away.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.185
He pushes everybody away,
like his nephew.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.789
See, that must run
in the family too.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.926
A thousand points of light.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.763
- Mm.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.875
- Yeah?
- Hey.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.142
You ready to dive?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.943
- You found the car?
- Nope.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.580
No, I'm just
nostalgic to see

08:35.582 --> 08:37.849
<i>Your black ass
in swim trunks again.</i>

08:39.952 --> 08:41.253
Leonard...

08:41.255 --> 08:43.087
<i>You there?</i>

08:43.090 --> 08:45.156
- I don't know, hap.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.826
I gotta mull over this hippie
scavenger hunt of yours.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.762
- Why are you whispering?
Raoul with you?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.030
- Why, you jealous?

08:54.201 --> 08:58.069
I know, a hard dick
knows no conscience.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.938
- Tell me about it.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.073
- You're gonna need to bring
your guns with you.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.875
- Thought you
didn't like my guns.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.578
- I don't like gators trying
to eat my face either.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.046
<i>What kind of time
can you get here?</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:09.581
- Told you I had
to mull it over.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.715
Now, let me mull.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.284
- Well, don't mull too long.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.920
- A mull takes
as long as a mull takes.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.821
- Perfect.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.658
See you at 2:00, then.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.704
- This is a good look
on you.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.941
- What, broke, tired,
and sweatin'?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.710
- Yeah, sexy.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.113
- You just like to see
a man on his knees.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.391
It was good last night.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.426
- It's always good.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.662
It's us.

11:03.664 --> 11:09.000
- Yeah, but it was...

11:09.002 --> 11:11.369
Felt different, I guess.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.038
- It was that gator.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.410
- Yeah.
Yeah, I paid him 20 bucks

11:18.412 --> 11:22.313
To throw you in the water
and scare you half to death.

11:24.216 --> 11:28.186
- Maybe it just felt
like it used to.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.959
- Just can't get
enough of him.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.161
- Aw, he grows on ya.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.295
- Like a fungus.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.999
- Okay, I'm out of here.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.100
- Hey, thanks.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.838
Trudy.

11:46.840 --> 11:51.710
That uniform,
you working for some chain,

11:51.712 --> 11:53.812
Don't feel like you.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.213
- The faster you
find that money,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.248
The faster I can
burn this thing.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.817
- Hmm.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.152
- Good luck out there.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.255
Make me proud--maybe
we'll go gator hunting again.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.895
- And hap.
- Hmm?

12:10.897 --> 12:13.164
- Please think on what
we were talking about.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.200
- The sex?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.268
- Changing the world.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.314
- You ready?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.116
- Don't I look ready?

12:31.118 --> 12:34.252
- More like a man's got
the blood drained into his dick.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.854
- How's your uncle chester?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.989
- He all right.
Stopped calling me "faggot."

12:37.991 --> 12:39.224
- Oh.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.992
- Then again,
he can't talk.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.104
<i>- Police still have no clues
in the brutal murder</i>

12:53.106 --> 12:55.940
<i>Of a local marvel creek
police officer whose--</i>

13:23.436 --> 13:25.170
- There are options.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.406
You can always
move to canada.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.943
<i>You can be
a conscientious objector.</i>

13:31.945 --> 13:34.913
What you don't want to do
is refuse to go.

13:34.915 --> 13:39.083
That's where things get...
Difficult.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.952
- What are we talking
about?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.387
- Prison.

13:42.389 --> 13:46.591
- The right path isn't always
the easiest one.

13:46.593 --> 13:50.161
-we need to think
about this.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.400
- What?
- Ain't a time machine, hap.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.001
- What's not?

13:57.003 --> 13:58.269
- That piece-of-shit hippie van
back there.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.004
- You trying to tell me
something?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.873
- I'm trying to tell you,
you can't go back.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.211
- Can I have the radio on again?
- Just try.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.445
Try.

14:14.954 --> 14:18.256
Playing that shit in my truck--
gonna make me crash on purpose.

14:29.569 --> 14:33.271
<i>- Alpha 527.
- Alpha 527 </i>

for any suspicious behavior.</i>

14:56.630 --> 14:59.097
<i>Search all vehicles.</i>

14:59.099 --> 15:02.166
Any bright ideas?

15:03.235 --> 15:06.304
- You got a quarter?

15:12.378 --> 15:15.947
Yeah, I saw a couple of real
suspicious-looking characters.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.582
<i>- Where'd you see them?
- Yeah, uh,</i>

15:17.584 --> 15:20.218
In the parking lot
of the old lumber yard.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.286
<i>- How long ago was this?</i>

15:21.288 --> 15:22.687
- About ten minutes ago, ma'am.

<i>- All right,
we'll send someone.</i>

15:24.424 --> 15:25.924
<i>Thank you.
- Yeah, nope, you're welcome.</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:27.992
<i>Have a good day, y'all.
- Bye-bye.</i>

15:40.539 --> 15:42.674
- Say, uh, what's the name
of that movie

15:42.676 --> 15:45.109
With ronald reagan
and the monkey?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.011
- "bedtime for bonzo."
- ah.

15:48.348 --> 15:52.183
- Bonzo was good.
Movie was terrible.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.351
- Never saw it.

16:12.404 --> 16:16.207
Hap collins. Outlaw.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.276

Come on, kay,

Oh, god!

18:32.245 --> 18:34.812
- Yeah, that's right.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.882
Show it to me, baby.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.288
There's really no use
trying to scamper.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.692
Angel has her way,
if she wants it.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.629
- No! Oh, god!

19:02.174 --> 19:05.276
- You go to sleep,
sweet thing.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.445
I'm so sorry about the mess,

19:07.447 --> 19:11.315
But we needed a place
to pass some time, so--

19:13.252 --> 19:15.186
Plus my girlfriend
just loves kitties.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.224
Oh, come on.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.297
<i>- Please hang up
and try your call again.</i>

19:45.851 --> 19:48.219
- That is a big-ass river.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.723
Oh, what is that smell?

19:52.725 --> 19:55.293
- Gator bait.

20:15.981 --> 20:19.250
- Here. Shortening.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.655
- You want any salt and pepper
with that, some garlic maybe?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.325
Shit, I thought the chickens
were the bait.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.460
- It's called insulation,
dumbass.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.963
The river's cold,
and down deep, it's colder.

20:31.965 --> 20:34.765
Cold screws
with your head.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.971
- Maybe I should do the diving
and you should do the shooting.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.240
- Don't go getting all
"save the gators" on me.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.541
Not now, please.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.710
- What if I was to just
shoot near 'em.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.511
- You shoot that gator
in the head.

20:47.513 --> 20:50.581
Anything else,
you just making 'em mad.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.551
So what was you
and miss "stand by your man"

20:53.553 --> 20:55.620
Talking about back there?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.955
- Same thing
you and raoul talk about,

20:57.957 --> 20:58.956
Minus the extra dick.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.458
- Bullshit.

21:02.294 --> 21:06.397
- Hey, howard told me what
the plan was this morning.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.267
- And?
- It's complicated.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.435
Ah--

21:52.444 --> 21:53.611
Well?

21:53.613 --> 21:54.745
- Nothing.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.681
I can't see a damn thing.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.715
- And cold, huh?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.483
- Nuts must look like raisins.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.519
- Is that before
or after you went in?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.821
- Very funny.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.024
- So what's this plan
of howard's, anyway?

22:07.026 --> 22:08.526
- They just
don't want to do it

22:08.528 --> 22:10.061
Like they did in the '60s,
that's all.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.962
- What, no jam bands?

22:11.964 --> 22:14.765
- Howard's been studying
corporations--

22:14.767 --> 22:16.500
You know, how they work--

22:16.502 --> 22:20.571
Infrastructure, um,
diversification, shit like that.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.373
- Yeah, I know how it work.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.809
They hire white folks
and bend black folks

22:24.811 --> 22:26.777
Over the barrel
without no grease.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.512
Always been that way.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.481
- Hmm.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.651
- I know you not believing
this shit they talking.

22:36.655 --> 22:39.457
- Yeah,
I'll do the next dive.

22:42.728 --> 22:45.529
- You know, the world don't run
on fairy dust, hap.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.832
- Nope.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.533
Runs on money.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.602
So let's see if we can
find some, huh?

22:53.071 --> 22:56.140
- Remember, don't stay
down too long.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.616
Hap, I'm serious.

24:43.850 --> 24:47.051
Hap!
Hap!

25:03.568 --> 25:06.504
- How does it make an impact
if no one knows about it?

25:06.506 --> 25:10.541
- We'll make sure
everyone knows about it.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.142
It'll be a huge statement

25:12.144 --> 25:15.813
That you're willing to do
something like this,

25:15.815 --> 25:17.681
Something so fearless.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.851
- But--but we're talking
about prison, trudy.

25:20.853 --> 25:25.122
Two years is--
is a long time.

25:25.124 --> 25:28.192
- But I'll be here
when you get out.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.237
<i>Hey, shithead.
- Shithead!</i>

25:41.640 --> 25:42.940
Shithead.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.842
Come on, turn over.
Come on.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.177
- Come on,
say something.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.180
- Come on, say something,
say something.

25:50.182 --> 25:53.617
-
hey, buddy.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.686
I think I found something.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.822
- You asshole.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.164
<i>- We're initiating
a stop-and-question policy,</i>

26:07.166 --> 26:10.000
<i>And a cash reward's
being offered to anyone</i>

26:10.002 --> 26:12.069
<i>Who provides information
that leads to arrest.</i>

26:12.071 --> 26:14.838
<i>Now, no further comments
at this time.</i>

26:14.840 --> 26:16.607
- Hey.

26:16.609 --> 26:17.942
- Any luck?

26:17.944 --> 26:21.278
- Not with the money, no,
but I think I know

26:21.280 --> 26:25.583
What I'm gonna be wearing
to Halloween this year.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.953
- Softboy.
Holy--

26:28.955 --> 26:30.821
- Whoo!
You found the car!

26:30.823 --> 26:32.656
- I found it, all right.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.658
Yeah, nearly took it
for a damn spin.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.226
It's gonna be real hard
to get at, though.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.262
- It's deep.
Gon' need some gear.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.031
- All right, then.
All right, we're in business.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.167
- We might have a little bit
of a problem here.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.203
There's been
another murder--a woman.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.706
This whole town's
gonna be swarming with police

26:48.708 --> 26:51.108
By morning, so--

26:51.110 --> 26:53.344
- Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go get it.

27:48.733 --> 27:51.268
- All clear by me.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.903
- Same here.
We're all clear.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.338
<i>Over.</i>

27:56.374 --> 27:58.008
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.810
- Maybe you should just
hand me this gun.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.911
- I'll be more careful.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.187
- Paco, we're all alone.
River's all clear,

28:10.189 --> 28:13.090
<i>At least for now.
We are good to go.</i>

28:13.092 --> 28:16.093
- Got it.
Over and out.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.399
- Let's do this.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.038
- Oh, no!
- Get down.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.406
Shh.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.566
- God damn!

31:45.170 --> 31:47.404
- That felt like something
out of a movie.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.106
My adrenaline's going crazy.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.943
- See what happens
when you work as a team?

31:52.945 --> 31:54.678
- I told you
hap would find it.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.014
- Hey, shh.
Hey.

32:07.325 --> 32:11.328
- Who left the gate open?
Uh-oh.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.666
- Goddamned bible thumper.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.968
He must've heard
about the reward money.

32:17.970 --> 32:21.672
- Shit, no telling how many cops
or roadblocks are out there.

32:21.674 --> 32:23.373
We need to get
out of this county,

32:23.375 --> 32:26.043
Find someplace
to lay low for a while.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.012
- Hey, uh, we could always
go to leonard's place.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.047
- What?

32:30.049 --> 32:32.282
- My place too small.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.084
- Back it up, hap.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.720
Get us outta here.

33:02.113 --> 33:03.447
- Up here.

33:03.449 --> 33:04.982
- Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.150
Watch my damn table.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.757
- Okay.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.059
- We can get you
a new table, man.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.995
- Leonard,
where are your glasses?

33:17.997 --> 33:20.063
- In the cupboard
right over there.

33:21.199 --> 33:24.368
- All right.
- Here, whiskey.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.569
- We got them skinny numbers?

33:25.571 --> 33:27.671
- Keep it on the plastic.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.006
- Fire 'em up.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.141
- Hap, where you going?

33:32.777 --> 33:34.277
- Aw, yeah.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.579
- All right.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.217
- Mm, mm, mm.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.427
- Hey, man.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.262
Want a hit?

33:52.264 --> 33:55.198
- No, no thanks.
That shit gives you tits.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.134
You seen that dude
jerry garcia?

33:57.136 --> 33:59.169
Man got d cups.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.771
- Oh.
- Here you go.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.377
- Get that in ya.

34:07.379 --> 34:13.083
- Tonight, this is
a victory for all of us.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.384
Cheers.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.623
- Yeah, thanks.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.692
- Your whiskey, man.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.530
- Don't I know it.

34:26.532 --> 34:30.100
Crack a window!
Smell like woodstock in here.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.701
- Hey.
- Nah, no, brother.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.670
It give--
makes me paranoid.

34:33.672 --> 34:37.474
- Ah, paranoia just means
having all the facts, man.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.574
- Huh?

34:38.577 --> 34:39.775
- Burroughs.

34:39.777 --> 34:40.811
- Oh, right.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.545
yeah.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.614
- Give that to him.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.723
Ahh.
Mm.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.328
- Hell, no.
Hell, no.

35:00.698 --> 35:03.333
Everything in my house
is off-limits to you.

35:03.335 --> 35:06.603
That's the rule.
Now go on.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.668
- Ugh!

35:45.777 --> 35:49.146
- Are you serious, leonard?
You actually own this?

35:49.148 --> 35:51.581
- Play it all the time.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.316
Great harmonies.

36:21.547 --> 36:22.779
- Let me try.
Let me try.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.682
- Mm-hmm.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.651
- Oh.
- You did it, hap.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.926
- You and me,
just like the old times.

36:35.928 --> 36:39.496
- New times, honey.
New times.

36:40.866 --> 36:41.865
- Trudy.

38:11.589 --> 38:12.956
- Can you hold on
one second, sir?

38:12.958 --> 38:14.424
What?

38:14.426 --> 38:17.394
- I refuse to serve,
based on principle.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.964
- What did you say?

38:20.966 --> 38:23.900
- I refuse to serve,
based on principle.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.436
- Line's over there.

38:46.625 --> 38:51.628
- So what's next
for hap collins?

38:51.630 --> 38:53.730
- That's a big question.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.899
- You've had your whole life
to think about it.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.004
- I'm looking for an answer,
sugar...

39:04.009 --> 39:06.676
- Preferably a good one.

39:08.880 --> 39:13.350
- Listen, I-I'm all for
changing the world and all,

39:13.352 --> 39:19.522
And I think what you guys have
been talking about is just...

39:19.524 --> 39:22.592
But I don't think I want
to run away from everything

39:22.594 --> 39:25.995
Just yet
and join the circus,

39:25.997 --> 39:29.799
However exciting
that circus is.

39:29.801 --> 39:33.036
- So you still think that
this is all just a big joke?

39:33.038 --> 39:35.004
- No.

39:35.006 --> 39:39.576
No, no, no, no, no, that's--
that's not what I mean.

39:39.578 --> 39:44.147
I'm sorry.
You know me, baby, I--

39:44.149 --> 39:47.584
I'm not always good
with words.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.520
- You have your moments.

39:50.522 --> 39:53.523
- I just want to be with you.

39:53.525 --> 39:58.395
Not the whole...
Package.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.697
Just you.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.632
You understand?

40:18.183 --> 40:19.649
- Shh.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.459
oh, shit.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.501
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

40:38.503 --> 40:39.869
- What?

40:41.872 --> 40:44.574
No, no.
- It's mulch.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.643
- No.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.086
Don't think about it.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.956
- Think about what?

40:59.958 --> 41:03.626
- Whatever it is
you're thinking about.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.795
This time tomorrow,

41:05.797 --> 41:09.866
We are gonna have
a bucket-load of cash,

41:09.868 --> 41:12.769
Foot massages on a beach
somewhere,

41:12.771 --> 41:15.939
Little cucumber rings
on our eyes.

41:21.178 --> 41:26.015
- Boys, it looks like
the shoe's on the other foot.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.620
- Howard...

41:30.622 --> 41:33.823
I don't even know what
that means in this context.

41:33.825 --> 41:37.126
- It means we're taking
all the money,

41:37.128 --> 41:42.031
And if you try to stop us,
we'll kill you.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.569
- Goddamn it, hap.
