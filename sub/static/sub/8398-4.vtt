WEBVTT

00:00.938 --> 00:02.385
Don't move.

00:03.801 --> 00:05.975
- This is my mate, Justin.
- Hey there.

00:05.991 --> 00:07.279
- Hey.
- And I love him.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.642
All I want is what you want.

00:09.658 --> 00:11.011
To have these people locked up,

00:11.042 --> 00:12.911
so they can't do any more harm

00:13.031 --> 00:13.928
to anyone else.

00:13.928 --> 00:16.094
Justin, I think I may
have taken a wrong turn.

00:16.213 --> 00:17.323
Do you want to talk about this properly?

00:17.362 --> 00:19.810
- That's why I'm here.
- No, I mean, properly.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.171
I'm not sure what's
supposed to be going on here.

00:23.140 --> 00:24.666
I'm completely lost.

00:24.713 --> 00:25.886
That's why we're here.

00:25.894 --> 00:29.695
To help you understand
how lost you really are.

00:30.180 --> 00:33.699
How am I supposed to trust
you if you don't trust me?

00:34.100 --> 00:35.580
I will be back.

00:36.580 --> 00:39.019
I'm a copper, we're on the same side.

00:39.020 --> 00:40.276
I don't think you're going to shoot me.

00:40.613 --> 00:42.552
I warned you not to make me your enemy!

00:42.672 --> 00:45.876
- I warned you!
- No. Don't you... don't you...

00:45.907 --> 00:48.180
Hey. Get up!

01:00.055 --> 01:01.940
Justin.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.860
Please.

02:42.626 --> 02:44.778
Oh, God. Key. Key. Key.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.705
Are you ok? You ok?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.580
Mary.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.384
What did John say to you exactly?

05:22.179 --> 05:24.856
He said... he said he was busy.

05:25.260 --> 05:28.020
And that I should meet
him here, at his place.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.551
No.

05:44.740 --> 05:46.086
Erin?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.020
Man down.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.060
Justin Ripley.

06:19.085 --> 06:21.619
So what is it with John Luther

06:22.345 --> 06:24.359
and the people he loves?

06:47.380 --> 06:49.430
John, I don't know what to say.

06:49.874 --> 06:51.395
I don't have the words.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.134
Where is Mary?

07:07.180 --> 07:08.731
John Luther,

07:09.300 --> 07:13.355
you're under arrest for the murder
of Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley

07:13.980 --> 07:16.702
and the attempted murder of Mary Day.

07:32.224 --> 07:34.821
Mary! Hey, Mary. Mary!

07:35.334 --> 07:36.579
Hold on!

08:48.244 --> 08:49.289
Ok.

08:49.546 --> 08:52.411
From this side of the table, it looks like

08:52.993 --> 08:55.477
there's two people who
could incriminate you,

08:56.420 --> 08:58.679
one of which is now dead

08:58.917 --> 09:01.670
by the hand of Tom Marwood.

09:01.860 --> 09:05.361
And Mary Day would be...
had I not intervened.

09:05.481 --> 09:08.208
And you're welcome, by the way.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.500
You told her where to go, John.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.537
You told her where

09:18.681 --> 09:19.720
and when.

09:20.903 --> 09:24.250
And I think you did that
because you wanted Marwood

09:24.920 --> 09:26.628
to kill her for you.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.021
Yesterday,

09:32.090 --> 09:35.456
a few hours before he shot
and killed Justin Ripley,

09:35.481 --> 09:37.615
you spoke for some time to Mr Marwood.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.600
Your report notes that
during this conversation,

09:40.618 --> 09:43.420
Tom Marwood asked for more time.

09:45.274 --> 09:47.540
"Give me two days."

09:50.573 --> 09:52.081
And then you let him go.

09:54.180 --> 09:57.093
Which makes me wonder,
what was the quid pro quo?

09:57.140 --> 09:58.269
Shut your mouth.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.108
You let Marwood

10:00.822 --> 10:04.995
run free to kill his paedophiles and his

10:05.195 --> 10:07.104
scumbags.

10:09.220 --> 10:11.076
That's no skin off your nose.

10:11.107 --> 10:12.715
No humans involved.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.504
But then in exchange,

10:14.554 --> 10:16.000
does you a favour.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.700
He cleans up your mess.

10:30.215 --> 10:31.415
I loved him.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.879
He's got too many friends.

10:59.085 --> 11:00.706
We'll have to move him.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.659
What is this, John?

11:35.066 --> 11:36.618
I don't know, George.

11:37.037 --> 11:38.532
Stay here.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.519
Erin!

12:26.818 --> 12:28.540
Wotcher.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.457
'Detective Ripley has been hailed
a hero by his colleagues after

12:35.500 --> 12:39.029
'he was shot point blank in the
chest by vigilante Thomas Marwood

12:39.035 --> 12:41.113
'who has been branded a coward... '

13:01.180 --> 13:02.424
Oh.

13:03.275 --> 13:05.503
If you're going to go on the
run you're going to have to, er,

13:05.503 --> 13:07.092
lose the coat.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.407
It's my lucky coat.

13:10.020 --> 13:11.383
Lucky?!

13:11.878 --> 13:14.224
Right. Well, I would take it
back to the shop, if I was you.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.946
Get your money back.
It's obviously defective.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.662
This is a nice place.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.939
Is it yours?

13:29.940 --> 13:31.700
Don't be silly.

13:32.611 --> 13:34.075
Alice, what are you doing here?

13:34.500 --> 13:35.780
I saw the news.

13:36.647 --> 13:37.873
Where have you been?

13:38.300 --> 13:39.462
Berlin.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.994
I don't believe you.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.300
Oh, you should.

13:52.180 --> 13:54.316
I assumed you'd need it, eventually.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.620
Not yet.

13:58.195 --> 13:59.759
After Marwood.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.880
Then I'm done.

14:01.918 --> 14:04.220
Why? Because he killed your puppy?

14:06.100 --> 14:07.786
Oh, that's why you're here?

14:08.962 --> 14:10.589
To rub my nose in it?

14:10.860 --> 14:11.908
No.

14:13.466 --> 14:15.606
I came to help the people you love.

14:15.919 --> 14:16.744
I'm sorry?

14:16.794 --> 14:19.272
You assert this fabulous
moral conscience, John.

14:20.022 --> 14:23.019
This adherence to unwritten
law. Yet, time and again,

14:23.301 --> 14:27.300
it devastates the people you claim
to hold dear, but you don't stop.

14:28.326 --> 14:32.342
It seems to me your conscience
has killed more people than I have.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.251
Well, you know, you say "escape," George,

14:58.288 --> 15:01.980
but to me, this looks more like
the scene of a violent abduction.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.665
By Marwood?

15:06.380 --> 15:07.341
Presumably.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.812
Why not pop him here?

15:09.756 --> 15:11.133
The way he did Ripley?

15:11.176 --> 15:13.942
Well, we won't know that
until we ask him, will we?

15:13.967 --> 15:15.244
In the meantime,

15:15.287 --> 15:16.708
somewhere out there,

15:16.733 --> 15:18.297
there is a police officer

15:18.417 --> 15:20.637
in the hands of a known police killer.

15:20.656 --> 15:22.464
Well, either way, Martin...

15:23.009 --> 15:25.180
we both want DCI Luther

15:25.211 --> 15:26.444
returned to us

15:26.675 --> 15:28.357
at the earliest opportunity.

15:28.352 --> 15:30.404
A search is under way.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.881
Then widen it.

15:34.064 --> 15:35.090
You know, George,

15:35.128 --> 15:38.412
the Tom Marwood investigation
is under my command,

15:38.600 --> 15:40.052
and God help you

15:40.060 --> 15:41.309
if you interfere with it

15:41.429 --> 15:43.668
or question my allocation of resources.

15:44.362 --> 15:47.040
DCI Luther does have some loyal friends,

15:47.221 --> 15:49.540
- doesn't he?
- Oh, yes, he does.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.229
'One officer was shot dead
and another badly injured.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.728
'In what the police say
may be a related incident,

16:01.778 --> 16:05.019
'Milan Knizac has been
attacked in Mortlake Prison.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.299
'Knizac is serving a life sentence

16:07.300 --> 16:11.169
'for the murder of Caitlin
Marwood, Tom Marwood's late wife.

16:11.420 --> 16:14.499
'Caitlin Marwood was raped
and murdered by Milan Knizac

16:14.500 --> 16:17.512
'four years ago, after he
was released from prison

16:17.540 --> 16:20.100
'less than halfway through
a nine-year sentence... '

16:22.486 --> 16:24.629
- What do you want?
- Don't move!

16:40.959 --> 16:42.854
So where are we going?

16:42.873 --> 16:44.738
We're taking you somewhere safe,

16:44.925 --> 16:46.158
just to be sure.

16:46.683 --> 16:49.620
But you can't honestly think
John would ever hurt me?

17:42.300 --> 17:43.989
So where did you go?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.337
Oh, here and there. Got married.

17:48.012 --> 17:49.419
- You got what?
- Married.

17:49.626 --> 17:50.571
Why?

17:51.300 --> 17:53.762
Does it add a tingle of the
illicit to the conversation?

17:53.882 --> 17:58.016
It adds a tingle of
disbelief, is what it does.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.006
- Erm, where did you and...
- Bertrand.

18:02.019 --> 18:03.939
A conference in Sao Paolo.

18:04.265 --> 18:06.755
Oh, he was intensely intellectual.

18:07.425 --> 18:09.932
- He "was"?
- Sadly, he passed away.

18:10.052 --> 18:12.854
Some little girls grow up wanting ponies.

18:14.231 --> 18:15.864
I always wanted to be a widow.

18:18.579 --> 18:20.769
So, what about you?

18:21.740 --> 18:25.336
Have you found someone, hmm?

18:30.100 --> 18:31.292
Yeah. Kind of.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.677
And is she interesting?

18:33.797 --> 18:35.291
- To whom?
- Me!

18:35.660 --> 18:37.356
- I don't know.
- Well,

18:37.476 --> 18:39.351
I imagine she wouldn't be, terribly.

18:39.389 --> 18:41.760
She wouldn't be some kind of Zoe surrogate.

18:42.023 --> 18:45.060
You've got enough self-knowledge
to avoid that trap.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.900
So she's a pixie.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.204
- A what?
- A pixie.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.139
A sprite.

18:55.140 --> 18:58.291
A daydream of the life you
imagine you want to live.

18:59.230 --> 19:01.414
Oh, dear, I feel a bit sorry for her.

19:01.457 --> 19:02.746
You don't feel sorry for anyone.

19:02.803 --> 19:03.973
Well, quite.

19:04.342 --> 19:05.937
But in principle, I pity her.

19:05.962 --> 19:08.152
She's not what you want.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.260
She's what you want to want.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.220
What is it I want exactly?

19:15.535 --> 19:17.324
We're not talking about that.

19:17.731 --> 19:19.095
We're talking about Pixie.

19:19.139 --> 19:21.179
- Pix... her name is Mary.
- I know.

19:30.860 --> 19:33.940
'The officer shot dead
last night has been named

19:34.060 --> 19:36.501
'as Detective Sergeant Justin Ripley.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.367
'Detective Sergeant Ripley is
believed to have been killed

19:39.380 --> 19:43.810
'by Tom Marwood who first appealed to
the public in this video yesterday.'

19:44.592 --> 19:45.887
'Four years ago,

19:46.007 --> 19:48.927
'she was raped and murdered
by a man called Milan Knizac.'

19:49.328 --> 19:50.817
This him?

19:51.380 --> 19:52.624
This is him.

19:53.260 --> 19:57.723
Goodness gracious me.
What a needy little fishy.

19:57.754 --> 19:59.712
Oh, he's got a hero complex.

20:00.457 --> 20:03.691
He needs public opinion to
justify his own actions to himself.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.691
So what's the plan, Stan?

20:10.980 --> 20:13.139
I take away everything he wants.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.115
What does he want?

20:14.121 --> 20:15.560
To avenge his wife.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.862
To be admired. To become a martyr.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.227
All to make his wife's
death mean something.

20:20.684 --> 20:22.500
You'd take all that from him?

20:25.980 --> 20:26.853
Yeah.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.060
That's cruel.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.314
It's the cruellest thing I can think of.

20:34.940 --> 20:35.924
Ok.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.627
But if any police

20:38.747 --> 20:40.040
aren't out there looking for him,

20:40.078 --> 20:41.961
they're out there looking for you. So...

20:43.482 --> 20:45.409
how do we even begin?

20:45.529 --> 20:46.479
Well.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.737
First step.

20:48.931 --> 20:50.539
You're Thomas Marwood.

20:50.552 --> 20:52.253
You want to kill the man
that killed your wife.

20:52.373 --> 20:54.737
But Milan Knizac is in prison.

20:54.793 --> 20:57.646
So how would you do it?

20:59.060 --> 21:00.374
With leverage.

21:01.507 --> 21:03.077
Give me a lever long enough

21:03.390 --> 21:05.305
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

21:05.425 --> 21:06.462
and...

21:08.127 --> 21:10.072
I can move the world.

21:38.740 --> 21:39.868
Nat?

21:46.038 --> 21:47.326
Nat?!

21:57.260 --> 21:57.815
Hello?

21:57.853 --> 21:59.160
It's not an easy thing, is it,

21:59.185 --> 22:01.156
when your wife is taken from you?

22:01.638 --> 22:03.445
Well, do as I tell you

22:03.996 --> 22:05.366
and you'll get her back.

22:34.060 --> 22:36.020
What is this place?

22:38.406 --> 22:40.177
Nobody knows we're here, Mary.

22:40.471 --> 22:41.835
Not John,

22:41.955 --> 22:42.936
none of his friends.

22:42.949 --> 22:44.957
So, as long as we stay here,

22:45.201 --> 22:46.546
we're safe, ok?

22:46.765 --> 22:50.020
Just... try and make yourself comfortable.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.846
Benny.

23:31.820 --> 23:33.060
Schenk.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.335
Well, never let it be said

23:45.373 --> 23:48.540
that you are less than
audacious, Miss Morgan.

23:48.576 --> 23:52.048
Well, I've got an issue
with impulse control, Martin.

23:52.168 --> 23:54.545
It's in the genes apparently.

23:54.607 --> 23:58.223
You know, Miss Morgan, I must
remind you, I'm a police officer

23:58.448 --> 24:01.570
and you are a fugitive from justice.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.054
And that, by walking in here,

24:03.073 --> 24:06.595
you have, by default,
surrendered your liberty.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.692
Well, you're entitled to send me back.

24:10.124 --> 24:11.462
I wouldn't take it personally.

24:11.462 --> 24:13.671
- Besides, I'd only escape.
- I have no doubt.

24:13.677 --> 24:15.328
Meanwhile, John will be in prison.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.379
Or dead

24:17.174 --> 24:18.807
at the hands of Tom Marwood.

24:21.234 --> 24:23.617
Now, me, I'm as guilty as sin.

24:24.043 --> 24:25.732
Name it, I've done it.

24:25.769 --> 24:26.551
But...

24:26.952 --> 24:30.474
John's as innocent as I am culpable.

24:30.912 --> 24:34.171
So I suppose the question I'm
here to ask is which matters more?

24:34.653 --> 24:36.205
Punishing my guilt?

24:36.981 --> 24:38.977
Or proving John's innocence?

24:39.700 --> 24:40.728
Now John

24:41.404 --> 24:43.843
has asked me to tell you that Tom Marwood

24:43.963 --> 24:46.609
won't allow himself to be arrested.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.924
He intends to commit suicide by cop,

24:49.955 --> 24:51.926
to die a martyr to his own cause.

24:52.046 --> 24:54.792
Now John knows how to bring him in alive.

24:54.836 --> 24:55.887
But...

24:56.644 --> 24:58.302
he's going to need

24:59.053 --> 25:00.210
your support.

25:01.780 --> 25:03.780
What exactly does he need?

25:07.380 --> 25:08.781
For starters,

25:09.419 --> 25:12.566
anything you have on Milan Knizac.

25:12.580 --> 25:13.505
Oh,

25:13.943 --> 25:17.490
and I'm going to need a personnel file.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.300
Thank you, boys.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.038
Why did you come back?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.172
I beg your pardon?

25:36.292 --> 25:37.736
You heard.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.713
I told you. I saw the news.

25:40.007 --> 25:42.215
Alice, come on.

25:42.571 --> 25:44.317
None of this Berlin bullshit.

25:44.924 --> 25:46.463
You've been in London for weeks.

25:46.520 --> 25:47.796
What makes you say that?

25:47.821 --> 25:50.361
I saw a receipt for those boots.

25:55.340 --> 25:57.087
I wanted something.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.870
- What?
- You.

26:04.756 --> 26:07.872
- Alice, Mary and I...
- Oh, do be serious.

26:08.923 --> 26:11.313
You'll be bored silly
by the end of the week.

26:11.826 --> 26:13.803
- You and I are...
- What?

26:16.725 --> 26:18.058
Well...

26:30.660 --> 26:32.152
- What do I do?
- Let me have it, please.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.336
Erin, no. Leave it, it's fine.

26:34.386 --> 26:37.202
If it's him, it's important we know

26:37.221 --> 26:39.098
what he says. Ok.

26:39.955 --> 26:40.975
Answer.

26:42.420 --> 26:43.546
Hello?

26:43.584 --> 26:44.704
'Mary.

26:45.042 --> 26:46.418
Where are you?'

26:48.220 --> 26:50.222
I can't tell you that, John.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.418
They...

26:51.843 --> 26:53.263
they won't let me tell you.

26:53.383 --> 26:55.816
All right. Ok, of course they won't.

26:56.079 --> 26:57.393
Look, I won't be long, ok?

26:57.393 --> 26:58.625
I just want to tell you something

26:58.650 --> 27:00.703
and I want you to hear
me say it, all right?

27:00.823 --> 27:04.219
I haven't done any of the
things they're saying I did.

27:07.967 --> 27:09.031
Are you ok?

27:09.243 --> 27:10.563
Yeah.

27:10.858 --> 27:13.335
Hi, yeah, we've got a trace on DCI Luther.

27:13.380 --> 27:14.593
Well, look, don't be scared.

27:14.612 --> 27:16.945
George Stark's a bit of a dick

27:17.001 --> 27:18.922
but he means well, I guess.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.775
And Erin Grey, well, she just...

27:22.194 --> 27:24.077
she's got me all wrong, all right.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.386
But she's a good woman and...

27:27.056 --> 27:28.826
when push comes to shove, you can,

27:29.402 --> 27:31.285
- well, you can trust her.
- Ok.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.724
Are they with you now?

27:37.460 --> 27:39.567
What about you? Are you, um...

27:40.731 --> 27:41.826
Ok?

27:42.464 --> 27:43.866
Yeah.

27:47.980 --> 27:49.580
Yeah.

28:05.202 --> 28:06.860
Benny...

28:13.363 --> 28:15.177
Guv, can I have a word?

28:15.534 --> 28:17.660
- Huh?
- Now, please.

28:28.253 --> 28:29.905
What the hell was that?

28:30.287 --> 28:31.588
Letting her talk to him?

28:31.632 --> 28:33.140
What if he traces the call?

28:34.980 --> 28:36.556
Oh, my God.

28:38.780 --> 28:41.580
You're trying to lure
him here! Are you mad?

29:13.260 --> 29:15.618
- How is she?
- Safe.

29:20.905 --> 29:22.488
Did you find anyone?

29:23.764 --> 29:26.261
It'll be in one of these.

29:31.260 --> 29:32.755
Ok. Ok.

29:33.224 --> 29:36.578
Oh, I'm bored of this already. Ok.

29:36.822 --> 29:38.812
Milan Knizac is in the prison hospital

29:38.824 --> 29:39.925
because someone cut his throat.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.503
Joe Green has got access to him.

29:42.534 --> 29:43.820
He's a prison doctor.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.025
He's also married to Natalie
Green, who's pregnant.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.096
So that's who I'd go for,

29:48.115 --> 29:49.635
if I wanted Milan Knizac dead.

29:49.629 --> 29:52.645
And I needed leverage.

30:13.785 --> 30:15.739
- Who are you?
- Police.

30:15.740 --> 30:18.639
He said no police! No police!

30:18.639 --> 30:20.692
Just stay there, just stay there.

30:22.694 --> 30:24.727
Alice, Marwood's gone.

30:25.015 --> 30:27.672
We missed him, all right. He's long gone.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.740
All right, so what did he say exactly?

30:45.340 --> 30:47.393
That I should report to work tomorrow

30:47.420 --> 30:49.539
and kill Milan Knizac
with a lethal injection.

30:49.540 --> 30:50.780
And if you don't?

30:52.020 --> 30:55.980
He'll make sure that what Knizac
did to his wife is done to mine.

30:58.010 --> 31:00.581
- He said that if I called the police...
- I'm not police.

31:01.313 --> 31:02.940
I was the police. But I'm not any more.

31:02.921 --> 31:04.148
Who the hell are you then?

31:04.198 --> 31:06.900
I'm the man that's going
to bring Natalie back.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.429
Where are you going? You
can't just leave me here!

31:10.454 --> 31:12.969
If I take you with me,
you'll do something stupid.

31:13.089 --> 31:15.490
You won't be able to help
yourself. You love Natalie, right?

31:17.236 --> 31:19.106
What about him? Tom
Marwood? What about him?

31:19.094 --> 31:21.060
He won't know what hit him.

31:24.260 --> 31:26.614
Benny, small change of plans.

31:26.734 --> 31:29.091
I need you to get a
trace on the last number

31:29.479 --> 31:30.849
who called this phone.

31:31.337 --> 31:32.489
Yeah.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.140
Hello.

32:17.434 --> 32:18.798
This is

32:19.311 --> 32:20.775
Ryan Clark.

32:22.180 --> 32:23.690
He was over the limit,

32:23.916 --> 32:25.536
high on meth,

32:26.231 --> 32:28.990
he was banned from driving and behind

32:29.318 --> 32:30.982
the wheel of a stolen car

32:31.026 --> 32:33.229
when he ran over and killed

32:34.236 --> 32:35.919
a 12-year-old boy.

32:38.178 --> 32:41.037
Mr Clark then fled the scene.

32:41.575 --> 32:44.979
He was in prison for less than five years.

32:44.980 --> 32:47.907
This is not about Ryan Clark's rights...

32:48.027 --> 32:50.419
this is about our responsibilities.

32:50.420 --> 32:52.776
This is about us doing for ourselves

32:52.832 --> 32:55.316
what the state refuses to do for us.

32:57.380 --> 32:59.702
People like me have tried to be reasonable,

32:59.727 --> 33:02.998
we have tried to be reasonable
but nobody's listened.

33:03.118 --> 33:04.575
Oh, boy.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.978
He really does need the
world to love him, doesn't he?

33:08.016 --> 33:10.694
So now a 12-year-old boy is dead.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.222
My wife is dead.

33:14.135 --> 33:17.157
Many other people are dead.

33:20.180 --> 33:21.780
Well, no more.

33:23.501 --> 33:27.243
I have a list of people like Ryan Clark

33:27.906 --> 33:29.545
and I will execute them

33:29.665 --> 33:31.729
at a rate of one a day,

33:32.142 --> 33:34.776
every day, until the Prime Minister agrees

33:34.776 --> 33:36.521
to hold a referendum

33:37.341 --> 33:40.300
on the death penalty. Now,
that's all I'm asking for,

33:40.420 --> 33:43.021
is for the people of this country

33:43.065 --> 33:44.460
to be given a choice.

33:44.460 --> 33:47.763
It's not like you gave
Justin Ripley a choice, is it?

33:49.980 --> 33:51.773
That man's death is on your head.

33:51.798 --> 33:53.144
Well, I don't see how that can be right.

33:53.162 --> 33:54.658
I didn't ask you to kill him.

33:54.677 --> 33:56.260
I warned you to stay away.

33:56.380 --> 33:59.676
You can't hold me accountable
if you choose not to listen.

33:59.676 --> 34:01.784
See, the thing is, I
can hold you accountable.

34:02.060 --> 34:03.861
Me being a copper and all that.

34:15.661 --> 34:18.033
- What... g... give me that camera.
- Oh, I don't think so.

34:18.045 --> 34:20.447
Give me that camera or I will shoot him!

34:20.460 --> 34:21.737
No, you won't, Thomas.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.668
Not on camera,

34:24.056 --> 34:27.219
because people do hate a cop killer

34:27.340 --> 34:29.255
and you so very much want to be admired,

34:30.194 --> 34:32.579
which is a defect, really,
in a multiple murderer but...

34:32.580 --> 34:35.092
- Do not move another step.
- She's got a point there, Tom.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.652
I mean, you're not going to
shoot an innocent man, a cop.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.219
Not for the world to see.

34:39.219 --> 34:41.257
Turn off the camera!
Turn off that camera now!

34:41.263 --> 34:44.780
Why don't you just stop
all this, all right?

34:44.804 --> 34:47.425
And tell us where you're
keeping Natalie Green.

34:47.494 --> 34:50.260
Who has she ever hurt in her life? No-one.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.668
Not to mention the fact

34:51.693 --> 34:53.239
- that she's pregnant.
- Shut up!

34:53.714 --> 34:55.815
- Shut up!
- Come on, Tom. Come on!

34:55.936 --> 34:57.487
Just let her go.

34:58.688 --> 35:01.820
You being the... the
defender of the innocent.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.076
Stop, stop! Turn it off!

35:05.101 --> 35:08.048
Whoever the hell you
are, turn off that camera.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.607
Tell her to turn it off.

35:10.620 --> 35:13.292
Look. Look, just put it down. Put it down.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.300
Put it down and turn it
off. Do as the man says.

35:15.344 --> 35:17.321
You hear me, do it, do it, do it.

35:22.940 --> 35:24.700
Now move away, move away.

35:31.218 --> 35:33.608
Oh, what are you going
to do now, DCI Luther?

35:33.646 --> 35:35.091
What are you going to do now, Tom?

35:35.211 --> 35:36.593
She's not going to come back, you know.

35:36.606 --> 35:38.864
- I don't care if she does. I've got the camera.
- Problem is,

35:39.100 --> 35:41.055
the world is going to see that

35:41.336 --> 35:42.894
you're not actually a hero.

35:42.938 --> 35:45.535
You're just a cop killer

35:45.655 --> 35:48.744
that would kidnap a pregnant woman.

35:48.756 --> 35:50.646
I mean, come on, that's nasty!

35:50.646 --> 35:53.192
She's gone, Tom. There's
no point running after her.

35:53.261 --> 35:54.881
She's gone.

36:05.404 --> 36:06.380
Bingo.

36:06.681 --> 36:08.345
You, you! Bring her back!

36:08.539 --> 36:10.334
- Bring her back!
- Tom,

36:10.378 --> 36:12.242
it's not like I can actually

36:12.542 --> 36:14.819
show the tape to anyone really.

36:14.939 --> 36:16.921
W... why not? Why not?

36:17.041 --> 36:19.111
Let's say I did. What do you stand to lose?

36:19.136 --> 36:21.683
You... you still can kill Natalie Green.

36:21.715 --> 36:23.542
I don't have her, you do.

36:23.998 --> 36:26.464
So, er, I've got what you want.

36:26.514 --> 36:28.591
And you've got what I want.

36:32.740 --> 36:34.002
So what do we do now?

36:34.300 --> 36:36.098
You take me to Natalie.

36:36.218 --> 36:37.781
All right, you let her go.

36:39.451 --> 36:41.822
What and then you, you
give me back the tape?

36:43.220 --> 36:44.980
Give it right back.

36:49.700 --> 36:50.844
Liar.

36:59.860 --> 37:01.385
See, you forgot

37:02.067 --> 37:05.101
that I had stolen...

37:07.460 --> 37:09.356
I stole your phone, remember?

37:10.019 --> 37:13.811
So I have heard all those
lovely, intimate messages from...

37:14.956 --> 37:16.357
Mary Day, was it?

37:24.157 --> 37:25.314
So,

37:26.340 --> 37:27.567
you get me that tape,

37:27.610 --> 37:29.569
and I give you back

37:29.689 --> 37:30.876
your Mary.

37:32.178 --> 37:33.480
Ok?

38:37.155 --> 38:38.357
I'm a police officer.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.696
Give us that phone, I need that phone.

38:39.746 --> 38:42.386
- What are you doing?
- I just need this phone.

38:45.700 --> 38:46.227
Hello?

38:46.227 --> 38:47.723
Put George on the phone now.

38:47.923 --> 38:49.468
On speaker. Just do it!

38:49.660 --> 38:51.652
Ok. Ok. You're on speaker.

38:51.700 --> 38:55.300
You have to get Mary
out of there right now!

38:56.425 --> 38:57.633
Do you understand me?

38:57.651 --> 38:58.834
I think we've had enough of that.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.213
What are you doing?

39:03.620 --> 39:04.584
George?

39:04.704 --> 39:06.817
He's trying to lure us out of here.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.420
Please, trust me.

39:09.464 --> 39:12.298
Boss, you need to get
C019 down to Paragon...

39:12.317 --> 39:13.962
Paragon Towers right now.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.060
Get them there.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.860
Hello, Tinkerbell.

40:08.260 --> 40:09.656
It's John.

40:10.513 --> 40:12.696
There's nothing to worry about.

40:14.624 --> 40:17.057
We need you to stay here, ok?

40:45.060 --> 40:46.944
- Who the hell are you?
- Shh.

40:54.312 --> 40:55.607
What's that?

40:55.995 --> 40:57.490
Proof you shouldn't need

40:57.490 --> 40:59.967
of the kind of man John Luther actually is.

41:22.853 --> 41:24.736
When Stark and the lesbian get back,

41:24.736 --> 41:25.712
you show them this.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.676
Oh, and if you ever

41:27.739 --> 41:29.365
betray him like this again...

41:31.505 --> 41:33.860
I'll kill you and eat you.

41:39.101 --> 41:40.853
How does that sound?

42:27.100 --> 42:27.942
What's your name?

42:27.961 --> 42:29.362
What?

42:29.482 --> 42:31.295
What's your name?

42:33.660 --> 42:35.380
Are you Mary?

42:36.434 --> 42:37.655
Are you Mary?!

42:37.667 --> 42:40.245
Yes. Yes, yes, I'm Mary.

42:40.539 --> 42:42.585
Did John send you to do this?

42:43.220 --> 42:44.687
To do what?

42:45.331 --> 42:47.828
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- John Luther.

42:50.740 --> 42:52.551
I know what Mary sounds like.

42:53.177 --> 42:56.160
I've heard her voice.
You don't sound like Mary.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.606
I am Mary. I'm Mary. I'm Mary.

42:58.675 --> 43:00.440
Show me your wallet.

43:03.900 --> 43:05.540
Now!

43:12.580 --> 43:14.380
What are you doing?

43:28.003 --> 43:30.467
So I've got bullets, but no gun.

43:31.431 --> 43:33.145
That's quite Zen.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.013
You're Erin Grey.

43:44.540 --> 43:46.057
D... don't.

43:55.020 --> 43:56.220
Find me a nail.

43:56.224 --> 43:58.163
W... what kind of nail?

43:58.220 --> 44:00.234
A nail nail. As in, a hammer and...

44:00.420 --> 44:01.541
Ok.

44:35.609 --> 44:37.060
- Mary?
- Yeah?

44:37.123 --> 44:38.987
Is the door locked?

45:04.791 --> 45:06.993
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

45:09.180 --> 45:10.635
Police officer, open the door.

45:10.755 --> 45:13.431
Come on, come on. Get out.

45:41.860 --> 45:43.493
Give me the nail.

45:44.732 --> 45:47.322
Shh. Breathe, Tinkerbell.

45:47.384 --> 45:48.967
I don't know who you are.

45:49.368 --> 45:50.513
Open the door.

45:50.519 --> 45:51.658
- What?
- Gently.

45:55.981 --> 45:57.426
Close.

46:00.636 --> 46:02.751
Lean all your weight on the door.

46:40.744 --> 46:43.378
Nice try. Nice try, Mary.

46:47.010 --> 46:48.362
Tom!

46:48.681 --> 46:50.746
Isn't it time we knocked this on the head?

46:52.097 --> 46:54.868
Both of you. Move. Move! Move!

46:54.881 --> 46:56.589
Hey! Come on!

46:57.002 --> 46:59.574
Come on. Move it! Move it!

47:10.420 --> 47:13.688
Mary, it's going to be all right, ok?

47:18.100 --> 47:19.112
Tom,

47:19.794 --> 47:21.421
where's Natalie Green?

47:35.780 --> 47:38.311
Well, I'm going to be dead in a moment,

47:38.354 --> 47:40.770
so I suppose you're going to have
to live with the never knowing.

47:40.814 --> 47:44.180
No, don't punish me by hurting
Natalie, ok? She's done nothing.

47:44.300 --> 47:45.800
Who the hell do you think you are?

47:46.140 --> 47:47.665
To walk in here,

47:47.715 --> 47:49.216
after what you've done to me,

47:49.220 --> 47:51.751
and dictate what I can and can't do?

47:52.439 --> 47:56.000
No! Tom, don't. Stop, don't.

48:03.980 --> 48:05.780
You can choose, you can have one.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.211
Sorry?

48:07.211 --> 48:09.019
I said pick one.

48:14.620 --> 48:16.852
- Why?
- So you know what it feels like.

48:19.540 --> 48:21.660
Time's running out.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.979
Please don't do this.

48:25.980 --> 48:27.819
- It's your last chance.
- I can't.

48:29.095 --> 48:30.809
I can't pick one.

48:31.060 --> 48:33.679
- Then you'll walk out of here alone.
- Tom.

48:33.799 --> 48:34.713
Please.

48:35.620 --> 48:37.065
Please.

48:40.780 --> 48:43.503
It's ugly, isn't it? Being impotent.

48:43.547 --> 48:45.180
Being degraded

48:46.481 --> 48:49.522
by a violent man that
you'll never get to punish.

48:54.060 --> 48:55.500
Now pick.

48:57.340 --> 48:58.710
No.

48:59.860 --> 49:01.037
Fine.

49:01.157 --> 49:01.957
Stop!

49:02.001 --> 49:05.142
Just stop pointing that
gun at her head. Stop.

49:05.340 --> 49:08.082
- Then choose.
- I can't choose one.

49:08.100 --> 49:08.915
Five.

49:09.221 --> 49:10.810
- Four.
- Please!

49:11.192 --> 49:12.499
Three.

49:13.060 --> 49:14.270
Two.

49:15.415 --> 49:17.259
- One!
- All right!

49:17.260 --> 49:18.820
All right!

49:23.220 --> 49:24.606
Have you chosen?

49:25.180 --> 49:26.108
Yes.

49:26.228 --> 49:27.341
Then say it.

49:28.586 --> 49:30.419
Say her name.

49:33.580 --> 49:35.500
Say it now!

49:42.460 --> 49:43.809
Alice.

49:46.237 --> 49:47.419
Say it again.

49:53.540 --> 49:55.885
- Shoot Alice.
- Say it again!

49:57.558 --> 49:58.784
Alice.

49:59.860 --> 50:00.379
No!

50:08.620 --> 50:09.563
Oops.

50:10.364 --> 50:11.778
Sorry,

50:12.179 --> 50:13.974
couldn't resist.

50:15.300 --> 50:17.791
Run! Run. Run. Get out of here. Run! Go on.

50:21.180 --> 50:22.980
Go!

50:24.773 --> 50:27.339
Now, if I let this go,

50:28.071 --> 50:31.443
you'll die. Which is
what you want, isn't it?

50:31.487 --> 50:35.116
- Eh? But if I apply pressure just here...
- No.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.280
- There's a good chance you'll live.
- No!

50:37.487 --> 50:39.670
Please. Please. Don't. Please.

50:39.683 --> 50:41.679
- Please.
- Beg me.

50:42.098 --> 50:44.056
- Beg me!
- I'm begging you.

50:44.100 --> 50:47.099
Then where's Natalie? Where is she?

50:47.100 --> 50:49.659
- Please.
- Come on, Tom. Come on, Tom.

50:49.660 --> 50:50.551
The medics are coming,

50:50.563 --> 50:52.459
- they're going to save your life.
- No.

50:55.630 --> 50:58.339
She's in, she's in Cathay Street.

50:58.902 --> 51:01.155
- How do I know you're not lying?
- No. It's true. It's true.

51:01.186 --> 51:04.621
- How do I know? Is it true?
- Please. Just let go. Please.

51:06.340 --> 51:08.100
- You're ready to go?
- Yeah,

51:08.100 --> 51:10.470
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

51:11.659 --> 51:13.449
Please...

51:14.287 --> 51:15.883
Not on your nelly.

51:16.380 --> 51:17.653
Medic!

51:18.122 --> 51:19.743
- No!
- Medic!

51:23.530 --> 51:26.427
I need him alive, put
pressure right here. Here!

51:39.180 --> 51:40.579
All right, upstairs.

51:40.580 --> 51:41.478
Sir.

51:58.580 --> 52:00.023
Natalie?

52:05.369 --> 52:07.300
We're the police.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.157
You're safe now.

52:31.180 --> 52:33.205
Hold on, hold on.

52:51.900 --> 52:53.120
Boss.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.090
What's happening?

52:55.300 --> 52:57.186
They arrested Alice Morgan.

52:57.643 --> 52:59.340
Where is she?

53:02.700 --> 53:05.062
- And Mary?
- She left you a message.

53:09.980 --> 53:11.499
She gave you this?

53:11.500 --> 53:13.172
She put it into my hand herself.

53:15.940 --> 53:17.660
Benny, I appreciate it, pal.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.390
Where you going, boss? She went that way.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.620
I just want to say sorry to Alice.

53:49.660 --> 53:54.363
There's been a mix up over who's who.

53:54.921 --> 53:56.448
I expect they'll, er,

53:57.643 --> 54:00.421
they'll work it out in a couple hours.

54:03.136 --> 54:05.908
I don't care what she's done,

54:06.865 --> 54:08.010
John.

54:09.348 --> 54:10.969
She saved my life.

54:16.740 --> 54:18.441
So you should probably...

54:18.829 --> 54:19.980
go.

54:22.540 --> 54:23.934
Yeah.

54:24.660 --> 54:25.818
Yeah.

54:26.260 --> 54:27.540
I should do that.

54:39.460 --> 54:41.790
- I...
- I know.

54:43.540 --> 54:44.849
Me too.

54:59.260 --> 55:01.260
Go on. Go.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.419
It was clever. The choice you made.

56:57.940 --> 56:59.237
Marwood?

57:00.075 --> 57:01.226
Alive.

57:01.558 --> 57:03.084
Suffering.

57:03.585 --> 57:05.168
Good.

57:13.620 --> 57:16.040
You really do need to lose the coat.

57:46.780 --> 57:47.941
So...

57:48.523 --> 57:50.060
now what?
