Previously on
"The Secret Life of an American Teenager"...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.300
She was supposed to go to New York,

00:04.400 --> 00:06.500
but the boarding pass said Chicago,
so that's where she went.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
I'm just gonna go make sure
she makes the connection.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.400
Make sure that Amy gets to her new school.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
Let's go back to your old school.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.800
Uh, no, let's not.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.700
But it's the best thing you can do
for yourself.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.500
You can't just come in here and tell me
what to do.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.300
I'm your father.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.600
Lauren's not the next one. Grace is.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.700
Let's go somewhere.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.200
Adrian, it's not good to run away
from your problem.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.900
Every girl at this school feels like
you have every right to be here.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.500
Now, Amy, I never want you
to feel like you're alone here.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.300
Lookin' for Ben?

00:39.500 --> 00:40.400
Looking for Adrian?

00:40.400 --> 00:42.000
I heard she disappeared or something.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.100
Well, she wasn't at school yesterday,
and she hasn't returned my calls.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.300
I don't know if that counts
as disappeared.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.300
I don't know, either.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.200
But I heard Mr. Molina's disappeared, too.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.200
Hmm. Like the two of them are together
or something?

00:52.200 --> 00:53.100
That's what I heard.

00:53.100 --> 00:53.700
From who?

00:53.700 --> 00:54.900
Your two little friends?

00:54.900 --> 00:57.900
It's all over school this morning,
that the two of them disappeared.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.000
Your friends are liars, you know.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.100
They're the ones who started all
the rumors about you.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.200
Rumors?

01:02.500 --> 01:04.700
This isn't a rumor that you got
me pregnant.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.000
I don't like the way you said that.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
It sounds like you're blaming me
or something.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.400
You have some responsibility in this.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.500
And you know who else thinks so? Lauren.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.000
Lauren?

01:14.000 --> 01:14.600
Yeah.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.300
Oh, I see.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.000
Madison and Lauren can keep a secret
when they want to.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
What are you talking about?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.400
I don't kiss and tell.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.100
Hey.

01:26.300 --> 01:26.900
Hey.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.300
When did you talk to Ricky?

01:28.300 --> 01:31.100
And when did you start agreeing
with him that this is all my fault?

01:31.700 --> 01:32.900
What did you do?

01:32.900 --> 01:35.100
And don't try and tell me it was
just making out or something.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.900
It's never just making out with him.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.300
OK, wait just a minute.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.400
I am not you.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.000
I know how to say no.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.100
Let's go, Madison.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.800
Don't you take one step.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
I told you to tell her.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.400
And she didn't.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.200
Let's go, Madison!

01:46.200 --> 01:49.700
Don't forget you're dating my brother,
and I have a lot of influence over him.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.200
Stop it, you guys!

01:51.500 --> 01:54.800
We are not gonna ruin our friendship
over a mental patient!

01:55.900 --> 01:57.000
Madison!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.200
Well, it's true.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.800
He's Lauren's dad's patient.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.800
We don't know what for,

02:00.800 --> 02:03.000
but it must be something big
because he's good.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Really good.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.900
And really expensive.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.500
Mental patient?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
What's going on?

02:12.100 --> 02:13.100
Uh, nothing.

02:19.000 --> 02:19.700
Oh.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.300
Well, uh...

02:22.800 --> 02:25.000
the good news is he's getting help,

02:25.000 --> 02:26.400
and, um...

02:27.100 --> 02:28.100
Or maybe not.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.500
Maybe-maybe not.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
I don't know.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.200
Excuse me.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.400
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.800
I was looking for Marc.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
Yeah, so is everyone else.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.800
Should you be going through his things
like that, or...?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.100
Power is not given.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.200
It's taken.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.200
I'm taking this opportunity to compete
with Joe.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.500
I'm focusing on student intel.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.900
How'd you like to buy your school records?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.400
That's not ethical.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.800
I'm not offering to sell you another
guy's records.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.000
Just yours.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.600
Yeah, still... Uh...

03:40.900 --> 03:42.200
How'd you get in here?

03:42.400 --> 03:43.800
I'm a shape shifter.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.700
The janitor sold me a key.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.200
And it's yours for...

03:51.000 --> 03:52.300
a thousand bucks.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.800
Aw, come on. That's like a nickel to you.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.500
- No, it's not.
- All right, whatever.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.000
Do you want your records or not?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.400
Because if you want 'em,
you better hurry up.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.200
I don't expect to be here that long.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.000
Bye.

04:03.700 --> 04:04.200
All right.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.000
So I guess you heard.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.200
Ricky's a psycho.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.500
Like we didn't know that already.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.300
But it's been confirmed.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.200
You shouldn't start rumors like that,
Jack.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.400
Oh, it's not a rumor.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.700
- It's a fact.
- What do you mean?

04:16.700 --> 04:19.899
Under all those layered T-shirts
is probably a straitjacket.

04:20.200 --> 04:20.800
What?

04:20.800 --> 04:21.899
He's in therapy.

04:21.899 --> 04:24.200
Yeah, so? I've been in therapy, too.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.300
Shh.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.200
What is wrong with you?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
I don't care if people know
I've been in therapy.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.500
When we adopted Tom, our whole family went
to therapy, together and separately,

04:31.500 --> 04:32.800
just to talk through it.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It was very helpful.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.200
Grace, people already think you're
weird enough.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.400
Well, I don't care what people think.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.500
- I've been in therapy.
- Just, please.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.900
Trust me on this one, OK?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.100
That's two strikes against you.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.700
You're and you've been to therapy.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.300
You're a crazy Christian.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.800
You really want that getting out?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.000
I'm a crazy Christian!

04:51.000 --> 04:52.100
Yeah, I am.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.400
I'm a crazy Christian.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.600
And I see you're not wearing your
promise ring anymore.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.800
No. You saw me take it off.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.400
Yeah, and I thought you took it off
in anger.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.700
Plus, I thought your parents would make
you put it right back on.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.200
No. They haven't even noticed it was off.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.300
Well, you should put it back on.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.400
It's not safe out here.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.000
No.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.900
I don't care if it's not safe out here.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.300
It's safe in here.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.200
Yeah, but decisions about sex aren't made
with your brain.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.800
Seriously, put that thing back on.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.600
- No.
- Why?

05:13.600 --> 05:14.800
Because, haven't you heard?

05:14.800 --> 05:16.000
I'm a crazy Christian.

05:20.200 --> 05:20.800
Look,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.400
I know you're psychotic enough
to go after Grace,

05:23.400 --> 05:24.200
but I'm a nice guy,

05:24.200 --> 05:25.900
so I'm gonna tell you how it works, OK?

05:26.100 --> 05:28.200
See, right now, she's not wearing
her promise ring.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.400
But don't let that fool you.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.900
Grace loves to make out.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.400
So you might go on a date,

05:32.400 --> 05:34.100
you might even start to make out with her.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.800
But right when you think she's ready
to take it to that next step,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.200
she throws her promise ring on, and bam!

05:39.500 --> 05:42.200
There's a virgin force field that cannot
be penetrated.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.700
Interesting choice of words.

05:43.700 --> 05:44.500
What?

05:44.600 --> 05:47.800
Look... I'm just letting you know you're
just wasting your time with her.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.600
OK? She's just a big tease.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Amateur.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.900
I don't know what you're so upset about.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.300
He's going to Lauren's father.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.500
And Lauren's father only sees seriously
disturbed people.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.300
Oh, come on.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.600
He's in social services.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.600
I mean, maybe he just needs someone
to talk to.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.300
A lot of kids need someone to talk to.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.000
I don't.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.400
Well, maybe you should talk to someone.
You know?

06:09.300 --> 06:10.100
It might help.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.100
It might help what?

06:11.100 --> 06:13.100
I mean, you are going through a hard time
right now.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.700
I think I can handle it, Ben.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.300
But ??? handle it, it would be nice
to have someone to talk to.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.000
And maybe Ricky's talking to a therapist
because he's having trouble with...

06:22.700 --> 06:23.300
I don't know.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.900
But seeking help is a very responsible
thing to do.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.400
I mean, maybe Ricky's a much better guy
than we give him credit for.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.300
Come on, Ben! Are you crazy, too?

06:30.300 --> 06:32.700
Well, I did get hit in the head last week,

06:32.700 --> 06:33.800
fighting for your honor.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.900
So, yeah, maybe there is some brain
damage.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.700
Have I said "thank you" lately?

06:41.600 --> 06:42.600
Thank you.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.900
How are things with Amy?

06:52.100 --> 06:53.700
Oh. Uh, she's fine.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.200
- She's -
- I had sex with Alice.

06:55.900 --> 06:56.700
Yeah.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.300
How'd it go?

06:58.700 --> 07:01.100
Well, how do you think it went?
It was sex. It was -

07:01.100 --> 07:03.000
I already talked to Alice.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.600
Oh.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.200
Yeah. Sorry.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.000
She kept saying, "Hurry up."

07:08.000 --> 07:09.300
I mean, how romantic is that?

07:09.300 --> 07:10.700
I don't need the details, Henry.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.000
She's so bossy.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.300
Who can have sex with a bossy chick
like that?

07:14.300 --> 07:15.600
Oh, no.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.700
And it wasn't like she was any good at it,
either.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.900
For all that talk about sex,

07:18.900 --> 07:20.400
she really didn't know what she was doing.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.600
Neither did you.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.400
Jeez. Sex isn't Sudoku. OK?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.500
Maybe your relationship needs some work.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.100
Thanks for telling everyone about our -

07:28.100 --> 07:29.500
Bad first time?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.200
OK, guys.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.100
School hallway.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.100
People listening.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.800
Dignity. Sanity. Propriety.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.200
We're gonna try it again!

07:37.800 --> 07:40.300
We're gonna do it as many times
as it takes to get good at it.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.700
No, we're not.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.100
We have to. We can't just leave things
the way we left them.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.100
You have to get back up on the horse.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.700
I don't want to!

07:47.900 --> 07:48.800
Thank you.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.200
Oh, he'll ???

07:53.500 --> 07:54.200
So...

07:55.200 --> 07:56.500
have you and Amy...

07:57.400 --> 07:58.300
had sex?

07:58.700 --> 07:59.500
No.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.200
I wouldn't ask her to have sex.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.600
Well, I mean, not right now, anyway.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.400
Really?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
I would think that she's reached that time
in the pregnancy

08:06.500 --> 08:07.800
when sex is supposed to be really good.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.700
I just thought that maybe she would wanna
do it.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.500
I mean, since you two are in love
and everything.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.300
Bye, Ben.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.100
Hey.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.300
Hi.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.800
I'm surprised you're still speaking to me,

08:28.200 --> 08:29.500
what with my being crazy and all.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.300
Oh, didn't you hear? I'm crazy, too.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.700
The crazy Christian.

08:33.100 --> 08:33.500
Yeah.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.500
- I've been in therapy, too.
- Really?

08:35.600 --> 08:36.200
Really.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.000
And I found it quite helpful.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.799
And I trust someone who's been in therapy

08:39.799 --> 08:42.500
more than I trust somebody who can't talk
about their problems with anyone.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.000
I just started going 'cause I needed
to talk to someone about Amy and the baby.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.900
I'm just trying to be responsible,
you know.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.400
I mean, I screwed up, and now I wanna make
up for it.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
Not that I can, but you know what I mean.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.000
The thing is,
just as I was making some progress,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.700
I find out that my shrink's daughter
is Amy's friend Lauren.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.600
And now... I don't know.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.900
I don't think I can go back there.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.500
I don't feel safe there anymore.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.500
I feel like my business is all
over school.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.300
Yeah.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.000
Well, if you ever need anyone
to talk to...

09:08.400 --> 09:10.500
I know Adrian hasn't been around, so...

09:10.500 --> 09:11.200
Yeah.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.400
You haven't heard from her, have you?

09:12.400 --> 09:13.000
No.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.700
I heard she ran off with that counselor,
Mr. Molina.

09:15.900 --> 09:16.800
What?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.500
You know she's a troubled girl.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.300
I just seem to attract trouble.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.000
Except when it comes to you, Grace...

09:24.900 --> 09:26.300
I kinda wanna kiss you.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.900
I just thought I'd tell you that.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.100
You're very kind.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.100
Kind?

09:33.100 --> 09:35.000
You're just trying to make me feel better,
right?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
No.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.600
No, I'm trying to make me feel better.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.100
I'm attracted to you.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.400
Even though I'm a mental case?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.600
I don't think that you're a mental case.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.200
So maybe you could call me or something.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.200
Yeah. I will call you.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.100
Maybe we can do something tonight.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.700
Yeah, I'd love that.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.400
Hey, Shawn.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:20.000 --> 10:20.900
Haven't seen you around.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.800
Where've you been?

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
Where've I been?

10:23.200 --> 10:23.900
Yeah.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.400
When did you get an attitude?

10:27.400 --> 10:28.800
I don't have an attitude.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.400
Great. So, maybe we can go out sometime?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.400
I don't know.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.600
I'm kind of busy.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Doing what?

10:35.000 --> 10:35.800
Come on.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.600
All right. Call me.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.500
Emotionally immature? What does that mean?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.700
Emotionally immature?

11:13.700 --> 11:15.600
Hey, man, I didn't write that stuff.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.800
I'm mature. I'm very mature.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.300
Emotionally and physically. Right?

11:18.600 --> 11:19.300
Mm.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.600
I would benefit from therapy?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.900
Oh, yeah. See, actually,
that-that part I added.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.800
It... it's a personal opinion, you know?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.700
You can't put that in my permanent record!

11:28.700 --> 11:29.700
Look, my friend.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.700
You need help, OK?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.400
You ???

11:33.400 --> 11:35.600
The girl is obviously in love with Ricky.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.000
And, yeah, maybe you are emotionally
immature.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.800
But for a 20,

11:41.100 --> 11:43.600
I can make all that disappear.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.800
For a 50, I can turn you into a whole
different student.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.300
Completely.

11:50.700 --> 11:51.400
Think about it.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.600
Are you Marc Molina?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.500
I... might be.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.400
???

11:58.700 --> 11:59.900
El Cucuy.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.300
Excuse me.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.500
Sit down.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.600
Where ???

12:06.600 --> 12:10.100
Uh, well, the rumor is that he's
with Adrian Lee.

12:10.100 --> 12:10.900
They, uh...

12:10.900 --> 12:12.200
"ran away together."

12:12.600 --> 12:14.300
Well, that's a rumor. What are the facts?

12:14.300 --> 12:15.800
What are you, the po-po?

12:15.900 --> 12:16.900
Yes.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.700
Well, I'm late for class.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.900
Do you think Marc Molina ran off
with Adrian?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.300
I doubt it.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.600
- Why?
- Because...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.100
...that girl can do way better.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.000
And believe me, she has.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.200
I'm her father.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.500
Oh!

12:30.300 --> 12:31.300
Well, uh...

12:31.300 --> 12:32.600
it's just the facts.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.200
You know, it's nothing personal.

12:34.200 --> 12:34.900
But you know what?

12:34.900 --> 12:37.300
Call me if you need some digging around.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.100
Hey.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.200
Are you the new guidance counselor?

12:54.200 --> 12:57.100
'Cause I could really use some guidance
right now.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.200
See, I'm having trouble keeping
my mouth shut.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.000
I told everyone that Amy got pregnant
by Ricky,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.200
and now I'm telling everyone that Ricky
is crazy.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.500
You know, Ricky Underwood.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
It's OK that I'm telling you this, right?

13:07.300 --> 13:08.900
Because this could be pretty serious,

13:08.900 --> 13:10.700
telling everyone that Ricky's crazy.

13:11.100 --> 13:15.500
You know, I feel like I've violated
some sort of patient/doctor/

13:15.500 --> 13:17.800
daughter-of-doctor code because,

13:17.800 --> 13:20.400
you see, Lauren is the daughter
of the doctor.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.100
He's a shrink, and he treats Ricky.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.600
So, I'm kind of afraid that Ricky might
kill me

13:25.900 --> 13:29.200
because he's a little on edge 'cause his
girlfriend Adrian disappeared.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.600
And she's, like, the school skank.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.600
And it's so funny, too,
because everyone knows it,

13:34.600 --> 13:36.700
and she, like, embraces it.

13:37.000 --> 13:37.900
But anyway...

13:38.500 --> 13:42.600
You see, her father showed up here
and he's threatened to take her away ???

13:42.600 --> 13:44.700
so she ran off with the guidance
counselor.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.300
I'm guessing that's how you got this job.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.600
Ohh.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.800
I get it.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.800
I'm supposed to do all the talking.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.300
Yeah. It's like we're in therapy.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.600
Not that I've ever been in therapy.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.900
I'm not crazy, OK?

14:02.500 --> 14:03.900
I'm Adrian's father.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.200
I'm looking for my daughter.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.200
Do you know if she ran off
with Marc Molina?

14:07.200 --> 14:10.000
Wait. You're replacing the guy she ran
off with?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.500
That's not right, is it?

14:12.900 --> 14:14.200
I'm a district attorney.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.300
Oh, cool. So, do you have, like,
the authority to sign a hall pass?

14:18.800 --> 14:19.400
No.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.300
OK, well, um, I-I was kidding
about the school skank stuff.

14:24.300 --> 14:27.700
Um, she is actually a very talented girl.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.300
She's a very talented majorette.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.300
And she's very smart.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.100
Really?

14:32.100 --> 14:32.900
Yeah.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.400
Pull her file.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.200
Well, thank you.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.800
I feel a lot better, so...

14:39.100 --> 14:40.100
thanks.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.600
Excuse me.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.700
Who are you and what are you doing
in here?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.100
Oh. Well, you could've come
by the front office.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.400
We were expecting you.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.100
I need to talk to Grace Bowman.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.300
This proves it.
They must've run off together.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.000
Emotionally immature? What does that mean?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.500
Hey, Jack!

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Madison.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.900
OK, Madison.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.400
Do you think I'm emotionally immature?

15:14.400 --> 15:15.100
I don't know.

15:15.100 --> 15:15.900
I hope not.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.500
'Cause I'm about to tell you something.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.300
OK. I've already heard that Ricky's crazy,
but...

15:19.300 --> 15:20.800
Oh, no. I started that rumor.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.500
Hello? Old news.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.500
Adrian's father is up in Marc Moli
and he's looking for her.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
So this proves it.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.600
They ran off together.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.500
That's who that is?

15:29.500 --> 15:30.800
Yeah. He's a DA.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.300
Oh, Jesus.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.700
I took my file.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.100
I stole it right in front of him.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.600
That's more than a little immature.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.700
You could get arrested.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.500
What is wrong with me lately?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.200
Do you think I need therapy?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.200
Well, isn't your stepfather a minister?

15:44.200 --> 15:45.700
Doesn't he counsel people?

15:45.700 --> 15:48.200
Yeah, but that's like a surgeon operating
on his own son.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.600
I can't ask him for help.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.000
I can't let him see what's inside of me.
You know?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Yeah.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.700
I can't tell my dad anything.

15:55.700 --> 15:56.700
Wait.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.100
Maybe that's why I have to tell
everyone everything!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.600
Maybe this is my breakthrough.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.400
I think I'm healed!

16:07.900 --> 16:09.500
That girl is crazy.

16:13.100 --> 16:13.900
Hi.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.100
Hi, there.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm Adrian's father.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.900
I remember.

16:19.900 --> 16:20.700
I'm Grace.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.800
But, of course, you knew that.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.900
You called for me.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
Ruben Enriquez.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.900
Grace, you mind answering a few questions?

16:25.900 --> 16:27.100
No, not at all.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.400
I was recently interrogated
by the police department.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.600
About who hit Ben.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.300
And before that, I had an altercation.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.900
But the police never questioned me,
just a lot of reporters.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.100
Should I sit down?

16:36.500 --> 16:37.400
Why not?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.700
So you and Adrian are friends?

16:41.900 --> 16:42.700
Yes.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.600
And I can tell you that you really hurt
her by not contacting her for 16 years.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.700
And frankly, I think she was a little
disappointed that night

16:48.700 --> 16:51.200
when you came out to the car
and just told her to go away.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.900
I know that you were shocked to see her,

16:52.900 --> 16:55.300
but I think it was a little insensitive.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.600
Oh. Right.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.900
You have questions.

16:58.900 --> 16:59.600
Go ahead.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.400
Thank you.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.300
You're welcome.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.600
Grace, Adrian seems to have disappeared.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.599
Do you have any idea where she is?

17:05.599 --> 17:06.599
No.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.900
I'm sorry. How could you not contact her
for 16 years?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.700
I mean, a girl needs her father.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.599
Yeah.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.200
Where's your father?

17:16.200 --> 17:18.300
Oh, my father is Dr. Marshall Bowman.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.500
He and my mother have been together
my whole life.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.500
But still, I have problems.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.599
I can't imagine what it must be like
for Adrian.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.099
When was the last time you talked to her?

17:26.099 --> 17:26.900
About you?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.400
Or just, like, in general?

17:28.400 --> 17:30.700
I mean, just when was the last time you
talked to her?

17:30.700 --> 17:32.500
And did she say anything about leaving
home?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.800
Well, I called her after Amy showed
up back at school

17:34.800 --> 17:36.300
and we all walked her down the hallway.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
All the girls did,

17:37.800 --> 17:39.500
because Amy is pregnant.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.000
And I wanted her to feel comfortable
coming back to school here.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.800
But I noticed that Adrian wasn't there,
so I called her.

17:45.000 --> 17:45.600
And?

17:45.600 --> 17:46.800
And she didn't answer.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.100
But I left her a voicemail.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.200
But she didn't call me back.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.400
But she doesn't always call me back.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.000
Did you talk to her last weekend?

17:55.200 --> 17:55.800
No.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.600
Yes.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.600
Wait a minute.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.800
That night, when the two of us got back
from your house,

18:00.900 --> 18:03.500
my brother was at my house, and he'd
ordered a hooker off the Internet,

18:03.500 --> 18:05.300
so I called Adrian to tell her about it...

18:06.900 --> 18:08.600
But she didn't call me back then, either.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.600
I told you, she doesn't always call back.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.300
Wait. Did you know that those friend
websites online are actually for hookers?

18:14.300 --> 18:15.700
You should do something about that.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.900
I'll get right on it.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.700
So, who do you think she talked to last?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.200
Probably Ricky.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.700
Ricky.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.200
I haven't heard from her.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.800
All I know is, she doesn't want you
interfering with her life.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.000
Yeah, well, she needs some interfering
in her life.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.500
And I don't think you should be hanging
out with her anymore.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.400
Evidently, no one should hang out with me.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.000
I'm crazy. Haven't you heard?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.200
Do you have any idea where Adrian is?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.300
No.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.100
Come on, kid. If you know something,
you better tell me.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.000
Listen, if something happens to her -

18:44.000 --> 18:46.400
If something happens to her,
it's not my problem.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.600
I'm not her father.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.700
Yeah, that's right, kid.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.700
You're the father of Amy's baby, yet
you're still sleeping with my daughter.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.700
Not anymore.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.800
She broke up with me 'cause I wouldn't go
with her.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.200
- Hi there.
- Hi.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.400
Here's my license and registration.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.400
Did I do something wrong?

19:21.100 --> 19:21.900
Sir,

19:22.800 --> 19:24.400
it's Officer Peter Pannigan.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
Got her.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.000
You can go now.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.500
Yeah. Nice talking to you.

19:29.900 --> 19:30.900
Where the hell is she?

19:30.900 --> 19:33.200
Old Route 66, near Needles.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.100
What's she doing there?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.100
I don't know, sir.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.100
Do you want me to ask her?

19:36.100 --> 19:36.900
Hold her.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.200
I don't know if I can do that, sir.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.400
She wasn't speeding.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.300
She has her license and registration,
and her tags are up to date.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.700
Look, I don't care how you hold her.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.400
Just hold her till I get there.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.800
I can follow her, sir,
but I can't hold her.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.100
You can hold her.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.100
She's my daughter.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.300
Think of something.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.400
Truancy.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.700
Sorry. Forgot my pen.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.500
Don Rumsfeld gave me this pen.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.900
Truancy.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.500
Yeah.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.100
I don't know where you are,
but be careful.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.600
Someone just call your father.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.200
I'm sorry, Amy.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.500
I fell for it.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.800
He called me. I went out to the car
to talk to him.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.100
And then we made out.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.400
OK, I'm not upset about that.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.400
I'm upset that you think you're smarter
than I am

20:46.400 --> 20:48.000
and that you're smart enough not
to get pregnant.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.400
Yet you fell for him, just like I did.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.600
So you're not smarter than me.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.500
Why does everyone think I think
I'm smarter than everyone else?

20:54.500 --> 20:55.300
Well...

20:55.600 --> 20:57.300
I guess because you are.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.700
And, you know, sometimes you make
other people feel stupid,

20:59.700 --> 21:01.700
like when you said I didn't have
enough sense to say no.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.300
No one wants to feel stupid about sex,

21:03.300 --> 21:05.400
and I'm walking around with "stupid"
written all over me.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.800
I'm sorry, Amy, about everything,

21:08.100 --> 21:11.400
about what happened to you,
about what I did, everything.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.200
And I miss you.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.000
I miss hanging out at your house.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.400
I feel like you and Madison are
still close, but -

21:16.400 --> 21:18.800
I just don't get that your parents won't
let you be friends with me anymore.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.600
I guess they think I'll get pregnant
by association.

21:21.600 --> 21:25.400
Or that I'll get the idea that having sex
at 15 is OK.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.500
I'd think you'd get the idea that it's
at 15.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.400
I'm pregnant.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.100
I don't know.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.800
Maybe they knew from the beginning that
the guy that got you pregnant has issues

21:33.800 --> 21:36.500
because he was sexually abused as a child.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.000
OK, that can't go anywhere.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.400
I can't believe your dad would tell you
that.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.500
What? No, my dad would never tell me
something like that.

21:44.700 --> 21:45.900
I'm sure he knows that,

21:45.900 --> 21:48.400
but he would never tell me anything
about a patient.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.800
How'd you find out, then?

21:49.800 --> 21:50.700
Ricky told me.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.400
Why? Why did he tell you?

21:52.600 --> 21:53.800
I figured it out.

21:54.000 --> 21:54.900
How?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
I'm smart?

21:56.400 --> 22:00.000
I thought that when I figured it out
and I got him to talk about it,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.500
I would be ???

22:01.700 --> 22:04.900
I thought I could be the person
that he would tell this to,

22:04.900 --> 22:07.900
the person that he could share
his darkest secrets with.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.100
Then I came to school, and there he was -

22:10.100 --> 22:11.300
back with Adrian.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.800
He didn't even say hi to me.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.800
He said he never told anyone.

22:15.800 --> 22:20.100
And I had no idea that he was in treatment
and that my dad was his shrink.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.200
You can't tell anyone.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.000
Not even Ben. Promise?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.500
All right. I-I promise.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.600
Amy, do you know how lucky you are
to find the love of your life at 15?

22:28.800 --> 22:32.600
I am in no way luckier than you
or smarter than you.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.800
And when Ricky told me he had this probr

22:34.800 --> 22:37.500
I should've just recommended that he see
my dad.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.300
But no, I had to go and feel sorry for him.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.300
And that's how he gets to people -

22:42.700 --> 22:44.600
he makes you feel sorry for him.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.600
Hey.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.000
What are you doing over here, all alone?

23:00.300 --> 23:01.400
I can't take it.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.000
It's different for me than you, Grace.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.900
People like you so they don't care
that you ever went to therapy.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.400
But me, people ??? because of Amy.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.800
And now...

23:10.700 --> 23:12.600
they love knowing that I'm in therapy.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.200
They think I'm using that as an excuse,

23:14.200 --> 23:16.000
like I'm trying to explain away
my behavior,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.600
like there's something wrong with me.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.900
There's nothing wrong with me.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.000
I'm not trying to hide anything.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.900
I'm just trying to deal with
the pregnancy.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.100
It's overwhelming sometimes.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.600
I created a life.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.000
I talk to my shrink about other things,
too, you know.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.200
Like you.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.900
Really? What do you say about me?

23:33.600 --> 23:34.200
No, wait.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.400
I shouldn't know that. Those are ???

23:36.700 --> 23:38.700
Private thoughts that I can share
with you.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.500
I told him what a great influence you are.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.700
I wanna be a Christian, Grace.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.200
I just don't know if I'm good enough.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.000
I mean, I'm sure no one around here
thinks I'm good enough.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.300
People are so cruel.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.700
I'm so sorry that you have to go
through this, Ricky.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.400
Grace, when you said you wanted
to kiss me,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.800
that wasn't because you felt sorry
for me, was it?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.400
No, of course not.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.100
I said it because I'm attracted to you.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.300
Where's your ring? Your promise ring?

24:08.400 --> 24:10.100
I decided not to wear it.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.900
I don't need a ring to tell me
when to stop.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.400
I don't, either.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.900
We should take this slow, Grace.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.600
Well, I think we have to.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.800
My parents didn't say that we can go out.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.900
They said you can come over.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.000
Fine.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.500
Because I don't want this to be like
my other relationships.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.000
Really?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.400
???

24:55.500 --> 24:57.300
??

24:58.000 --> 24:59.300
You're at school now.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.600
Try speaking English.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
I hate you.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.900
Oh, wow. What a concept.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.300
My teenage daughter hates me.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.300
You cannot control my life!

25:06.300 --> 25:08.800
You haven't been around for 16 years,

25:08.800 --> 25:11.400
and now you and my mother are not gonna
tell me what to do.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.600
Yeah, I don't know about her,
but I know I am.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.000
I just enrolled you in a private
all-girls school.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.200
Keys.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.400
That's my car.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.400
No, it's your mother's car.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.500
It's in her name.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.400
And you just showed her that you're not
responsible enough to have a car.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.300
I took a drive!

25:30.300 --> 25:31.800
Yeah - with a suitcase in the trunk?

25:31.800 --> 25:32.600
So?

25:32.600 --> 25:35.400
Maybe I just wanted to get away
for a few days.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.000
You don't have a job, do you?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.900
That's your mother's money you're
running away with.

25:38.900 --> 25:39.900
It's not your money.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.300
She gave it to me.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.400
Yes, but not to run away with.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.600
And you know what? You're old enough
to have a job.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.000
??? to give you money.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.700
My job is to get an education.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.600
At least that's what she says, anyway.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.100
And don't you have a job?

25:53.400 --> 25:56.800
How is it that you have time
to just sit around my school,

25:56.800 --> 25:58.600
calling the police to stop me?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.300
I was concerned about you.

26:00.300 --> 26:01.300
What?

26:03.200 --> 26:05.300
Your academic record is very impressive.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.800
Did Mr. Molina give you that?

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
Mr. Molina?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.600
I don't think Mr. Molina works here
anymore.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.700
You got him fired?

26:10.700 --> 26:11.600
No.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
You're lying.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.000
Mr. Molina has nothing to do with this.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.600
I'm not concerned about Mr. Molina.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.100
I'm ???

26:19.100 --> 26:21.200
And incidentally, I don't want
you seeing Ricky anymore.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.900
That is not your decision.

26:22.900 --> 26:26.000
You do not decide who I go out with!

26:26.000 --> 26:26.700
And you know what?

26:26.700 --> 26:27.600
I'm sorry.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.600
I am so sorry I ever looked you up.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.500
You know, just-just go back
to where you came from.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.400
And I promise I will never bother you
again.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.200
Ever.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.000
I can't make that same promise.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.500
It's too late!

26:39.500 --> 26:40.600
Don't you get it?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.500
I'm all grown up!

26:42.500 --> 26:44.400
I have my period and everything!

26:44.700 --> 26:45.800
I menstruate,

26:45.800 --> 26:47.500
I take birth control pills,

26:47.500 --> 26:49.500
I have sex, protected sex,

26:49.500 --> 26:50.800
with condoms!

26:50.800 --> 26:52.500
I don't need parents!

26:53.800 --> 26:54.500
Adrian...

26:55.600 --> 26:56.500
listen to me.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.600
You're going out with a guy who's
for God knows what.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.700
Your girlfriend, the crazy
Christian cheerleader,

27:01.700 --> 27:05.200
has been in some sort of altercation
and was just interrogated by the police.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.300
And she's interested in your boyfriend,
by the way.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.700
But what really bothers me is
that everyone in this school

27:09.700 --> 27:11.300
seems to think that you're a slut.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.700
Now, you need an adult in your life.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.400
Your mother wants to be your best friend,
and I don't.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.200
You need me.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come
to see me.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.600
I made a mistake.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.500
Well, before you make any serious
mistakes,

27:22.500 --> 27:25.000
let's see what we can do to get your
life going in the right direction.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.300
What does that mean -

27:26.300 --> 27:28.200
get my life in the right direction?

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
That's what my mother said.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.000
What are you two talking about?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.300
Adrian, I think you need to realize

27:32.300 --> 27:35.100
that you have a lot more to
offer the world than just sex.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.400
Ay dios mio.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.100
Come on.

27:37.100 --> 27:39.600
Give yourself a chance to have
everything in life.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.500
It's all there for the taking.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.900
Change to this private school so you have
a shot at making it

27:43.900 --> 27:45.600
to one of the top universities.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.700
You're a leader, not a follower.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.500
I see you becoming a governor...

27:50.500 --> 27:51.600
a senator...

27:52.200 --> 27:53.300
a judge.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.200
Forgive me, Adrian...

27:57.600 --> 28:00.000
and let me make up the past 16 years
to you.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.400
Hi.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.400
Bye.

28:12.700 --> 28:13.400
Wait.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.900
I want to talk to you about me and Ricky.

28:15.900 --> 28:16.700
Oh!

28:17.700 --> 28:19.200
So now it's "me and Ricky."

28:19.200 --> 28:20.500
Please, can I just come in?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.700
I prayed about this all afternoon.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.900
I wanted to know how you would feel
if we did go out.

28:31.800 --> 28:32.700
If we go out.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.500
If my parents even let us go out.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.200
Oh.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.000
How would I feel?

28:39.200 --> 28:40.000
Hmm.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.400
Betrayed.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.200
Oh.

28:44.500 --> 28:45.900
Well, by me or Ricky?

28:45.900 --> 28:48.300
Look, if you want my permission,
you are not gonna get it,

28:48.300 --> 28:49.100
so live with it.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.200
Either you're friends with me
or you sleep with Ricky.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.200
One or the other.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.000
Well, why can't I be friends with you
and just, like, make out with Ricky?

28:55.300 --> 28:57.500
You can't just make out with Ricky.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.300
You can't.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.500
I think I can.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.800
Just out of curiosity,

29:01.800 --> 29:04.500
at what point do you cut a guy off?

29:04.500 --> 29:05.400
Oh.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.000
Um...

29:08.300 --> 29:11.700
Well, no, like, hand-to-skin contact.

29:11.700 --> 29:15.600
Yeah, you are gonna need to get
on the pill and use condoms.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.900
You don't know where he's been.

29:16.900 --> 29:20.400
Oh, and he is going to be on you
before breakfast in the morning.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.700
That's vulgar.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.600
That's Ricky.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.900
Adrian, are you in love with him?

29:25.900 --> 29:26.700
No.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.900
And you can tell him that
when you see him.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.900
OK, I just do anything behind your back.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.300
Oh, I see.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.300
So if you tell me you're gonna do it
with my boyfriend,

29:37.300 --> 29:40.600
then there's no guilt and you
can enjoy it.

29:40.900 --> 29:41.600
You know what?

29:41.800 --> 29:44.400
You are a crazy Christian,
and you should go back to therapy.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.000
Oh.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.200
Hmm.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.100
And...

29:49.200 --> 29:50.400
take these with you.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.100
You don't want to end up like
Amy Juergens.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.400
What'd you find?

29:59.200 --> 30:03.000
One thing that's interesting is it says
that sexually abused kids

30:03.000 --> 30:05.600
have a very good sense of humor sometimes.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.000
They use humor as a coping mechanism.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.800
Ha. Yeah, I can see that.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.600
And they have intimacy issues.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
Do you think it's something he'll ever
get over?

30:18.200 --> 30:20.800
Like, do people who are abused
ever recover from it?

30:21.300 --> 30:24.100
Well, I don't know if this means
that they recover,

30:24.100 --> 30:25.800
but they learn to overcome it.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.400
I mean, they can't erase the past,

30:28.700 --> 30:31.300
just like I can't erase the pain
of losing my mom.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.800
But at this point, I can accept it.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.200
It's so what another person has suffered.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.100
You know?

30:39.100 --> 30:40.800
Like, they just become more human.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.000
I mean, I don't like Ricky any better
than I did before,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.900
but at least now I have a better
understanding of how he became that way.

30:48.700 --> 30:53.100
I hope our venture into amateur psychology
is not making you like him.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.200
- Like him?
- Mm.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.500
No.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.000
I guess we could have sex if you want.

31:05.900 --> 31:06.700
Oh...

31:08.000 --> 31:08.900
I want.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.700
I mean, it hardly seems fair
that I had sex with Ricky

31:11.700 --> 31:12.900
and I won't have sex with you,

31:12.900 --> 31:15.600
even though you did almost get killed
for me.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.200
Well -

31:17.800 --> 31:18.500
I mean,

31:19.300 --> 31:22.400
just a little beat up, but still -

31:23.100 --> 31:24.000
Really?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.200
Yeah.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.600
I find myself feeling really good
these days.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.200
Besides, I'm already pregnant.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.000
And it wouldn't hurt the baby?

31:32.000 --> 31:32.600
No.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.400
You're sure?

31:33.400 --> 31:34.600
Did you talk to a doctor?

31:34.600 --> 31:35.600
No.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.200
You know, even though she says
that there there's judgment.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.400
???

31:40.400 --> 31:42.400
So I looked it on the Internet.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.100
Huh. That's interesting.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.300
I did, too.

31:45.300 --> 31:48.200
You know, I, uh...

31:49.800 --> 31:52.200
I find myself very attracted
to you, Ben,

31:52.200 --> 31:54.400
and I want to do something nice for you.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.500
I want to do something nice for you, too.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.900
Does this feel more like a fair
trade agreement than sex?

32:01.300 --> 32:03.000
Yeah, kind of.

32:03.000 --> 32:03.800
Does that matter?

32:03.800 --> 32:04.800
Kind of.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.400
Oh, you know, I heard about Alice
and Henry,

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
and I don't understand what went wrong.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.200
I me all the girl has to do
is just lay there, right?

32:12.200 --> 32:14.900
And then eventually I just say
"Get off me," and it's done.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.900
I'm just joking.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.600
But really, I don't know much about sex.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.300
I don't know much about sex either,

32:23.300 --> 32:26.600
but I don't think this is the best time
to be finding out.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.900
I mean, I'd kinda feel like I was...

32:29.200 --> 32:30.700
trespassing.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.300
Come here.

32:37.600 --> 32:42.200
I just feel like maybe we should be a
little older when ??? for the first time.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.500
And a little less pregnant?

32:48.900 --> 32:52.000
Not that you're not the most beautiful
woman in the world,

32:52.900 --> 32:53.700
but...

32:54.700 --> 32:57.300
it still would freak me out a little bit.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.500
So that's a pass?

33:02.500 --> 33:03.600
I guess.

33:15.500 --> 33:20.800
"You are the full moon at midnight sending
the sweetness of light into my cup of tea."

33:21.700 --> 33:23.500
She's not having sex.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.400
Are you sure?

33:24.400 --> 33:25.600
Well, not good sex.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.600
What do you know about that - good sex?

33:27.600 --> 33:28.800
Dad, I know poetry,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.700
and I know a cup of tea doesn't represent
good sex.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.400
I don't think they're even hugging.

33:33.700 --> 33:34.800
I don't know about that.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.100
I think it's time you and me have a talk.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.300
Dad, please, this isn't the sex talk,
right?

33:41.300 --> 33:42.300
Of course it's the sex talk.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.400
I figure if I have the sex talk with you,
maybe you won't want to have sex.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.400
Probably not.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.500
OK, this is all you need to know.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.500
Dad, I have Internet access and a pregnant
sister.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.100
I know where babies come from.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.100
Oh.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.400
OK.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.100
Did I ever tell you about the day you
were born?

34:03.000 --> 34:03.900
No.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.000
Well, your mother went into labor,

34:07.700 --> 34:09.500
and we rushed to the hospital.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.400
They said it wasn't time yet,

34:11.400 --> 34:13.500
so they suggested we go for a walk.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.300
Or at least your mother go for a walk.

34:15.900 --> 34:20.000
But she didn't feel like it,
so we took a drive up the coast.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.800
Amy was with Mimsy.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.400
So, we're driving up the coast,

34:25.400 --> 34:26.800
and all of a sudden,

34:27.199 --> 34:29.300
both lanes of traffic come to a halt.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.300
And then the labor pains started getting
closer and closer.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.500
And your mother tried to pretend
that it would be fine with her

34:36.500 --> 34:39.900
if she had you in the backseat of the car
on Pacific Coast Highway,

34:40.699 --> 34:43.400
but I figured I'd pass out - you know,
like I did when Amy was born.

34:44.300 --> 34:46.900
So I pulled the car over onto the shoulder
of the road

34:46.900 --> 34:49.100
and started driving as fast as I could.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.900
And this cop started chas ???

34:50.900 --> 34:53.300
And when he realized that your mother
was in labor,

34:53.800 --> 34:55.800
he escorted us to the nearest hospital.

34:56.199 --> 34:59.000
At which point your mother closed her legs

34:59.000 --> 35:00.700
and said she was gonna keep you inside

35:00.700 --> 35:03.000
until we get her to her own hospital

35:03.000 --> 35:04.400
and her own doctor.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.200
And, uh...

35:08.300 --> 35:09.500
when I saw you,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.100
I thought you looked exactly
like your mother.

35:13.300 --> 35:17.700
And then Mimsy brought Amy in,
and we all just stared at you for hours.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.000
You were such a beautiful baby.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.800
You know, it's really different having
a baby when you'r ???

35:25.900 --> 35:28.400
and it's a happy time and everyone's
excited.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.900
I don't know how Amy's gonna do it.
I really don't.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.200
I don't know how we're all gonna do it.

35:37.300 --> 35:40.200
But we're gonna have to make it as good
for her as we can,

35:41.600 --> 35:43.000
because we have to.

35:44.100 --> 35:50.000
She's this sweet young girl who writes
poetry about the moon and teacups.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.800
Have you ever baked cookies before?

35:58.600 --> 36:00.400
No, but it looks like fun.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.900
Baking is fun.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.100
And I know that you're feeling kinda bad

36:04.100 --> 36:05.900
about the rumors that are going
around school,

36:05.900 --> 36:09.100
and I know we both feel a little guilty
about the Adrian thing,

36:09.100 --> 36:12.300
but I really do think that she wants
to spend time with her dad.

36:12.900 --> 36:15.300
But sometimes when I'm feeling a little
blue,

36:15.300 --> 36:17.100
I like to do something for someone else,

36:17.400 --> 36:19.800
so I thought we could bake cookies
for the assisted care home.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.100
My church does it all the time -

36:21.400 --> 36:23.100
bakes things and takes them over.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.100
What kind of cookies are we baking?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.300
Snickerdoodles.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.200
What?

36:27.400 --> 36:28.700
They're a simple cookie.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.700
Which is good, 'cause we have to bake
a double batch,

36:30.700 --> 36:32.500
which is like 150 cookies.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.600
That's a lot of cookies.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.400
Sounds like we might be here all night.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.900
Well, I don't know if it'll take
all night.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.800
So, what do we do first?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Um,

36:43.400 --> 36:44.600
melt the butter.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.500
Look, don't feel guilty.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.000
Adrian and I broke up.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.200
So how do we melt the butter, Grace?

36:57.400 --> 36:58.600
I love that guy.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
Tom!

37:07.200 --> 37:08.500
I thought you were supposed
to be downstairs

37:08.500 --> 37:10.300
helping Ricky and Grace bake cookies.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.200
Nope.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.600
What do you mean, nope? Why not?

37:12.600 --> 37:16.300
Grace gave me money to stay out of there.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.100
How much money?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.800
20 bucks.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.500
But I gave you 40 to stay down there.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.500
I know.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.000
Grace gave me 20.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.500
It's a good night.

37:28.600 --> 37:37.600
I am only $120 away from Betty time.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.000
What?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.400
You know Betty.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.700
My friend.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.600
Sit down.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.700
Tom,

37:47.800 --> 37:49.300
Betty is not your friend.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.400
Betty is a prostitute.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.300
And by the way, your mother tells me that
she scuffed up the floor in the hallway.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.500
You know, that's parquet.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.900
I did not know that.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.300
Buddy, I thought we had an understanding.

37:58.300 --> 37:59.800
You're not supposed to see Betty again.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.300
She's a nice girl.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.900
Tom, she's not a nice girl.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.400
You should not judge ???

38:05.500 --> 38:07.100
You cheated.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.200
You and Mom.

38:08.200 --> 38:11.500
You two cheated on George.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.500
Mom and I cheated on George?

38:16.300 --> 38:17.500
Where did you hear that?

38:17.500 --> 38:19.000
From Grace.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.700
- Uh, oh -
- Here, let me get that for you.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.600
Oh. Maybe you shouldn't do that.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.400
I think it'll affect the yield.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.000
Does this count as oral?

38:42.200 --> 38:44.100
No, this doesn't count as anything.

38:45.100 --> 38:46.400
Maybe not to you.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.700
Grace!

38:56.700 --> 38:58.900
I thought you two were baking cookies.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.100
OK, it's not gonna happen.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.500
What is wrong here?

39:08.700 --> 39:09.900
I don't know.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.400
To be perfectly honest, sex for me
is better without you.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.000
Oh, thanks.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.200
It's better for you without me, isn't it?

39:16.800 --> 39:18.100
I love you, Alice, but -

39:18.100 --> 39:19.200
I know.

39:21.100 --> 39:21.800
Yeah.

39:54.900 --> 39:55.900
Hi, George.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.800
I'm home.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.500
Are the girls in bed?

40:00.800 --> 40:01.700
Everything go OK?

40:04.400 --> 40:05.100
Uh

40:05.100 --> 40:07.900
You know, I think I owe you an apology
about the school thing.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.300
I was wrong.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.600
You were right.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.600
I think it was a good decision for Amy
to go back to her school.

40:14.900 --> 40:17.200
I think I underestimate you sometimes.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.800
It was great to get away with my mother.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.800
It gave me a lot of time to think
about things.

40:24.800 --> 40:25.900
Hold on, I'll go brush my teeth.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.000
No, that's OK.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.100
Really?

40:29.000 --> 40:29.800
All right.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.300
No -

40:30.400 --> 40:31.600
George!

40:31.800 --> 40:33.100
That's not what I meant.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.600
You look really tired.
Why don't you get some rest?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.500
We can talk about this tomorrow.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.300
Are you trying to seduce me?

40:42.900 --> 40:44.300
No, George.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.300
Good night.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.700
Well, wait just a damn minute.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.300
What, were you and Mimsy out bar-hopping
or something?

40:49.300 --> 40:50.200
Why would you say that?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.700
Where the hell you been looking like that?

40:51.700 --> 40:52.900
Looking like what?

40:52.900 --> 40:54.700
- You know what you look like.
- No.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.600
You look...

40:56.000 --> 40:56.900
hot.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.700
- Well, thank you.
- No, no, like a bad kind of hot.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.400
Like a "not hot for me" hot.
Like leftovers hot.

41:02.700 --> 41:04.300
I mean, who are you dressed like that for?

41:04.300 --> 41:04.900
Me.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.900
Oh, no. No.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.300
Don't you try that one.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.300
Have you got a boyfriend?

41:11.500 --> 41:13.100
- A boyfriend?
- Wrong answer!

41:13.100 --> 41:15.800
Don't you accuse me of having a boyfriend.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.800
You have a boyfriend.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.700
I do not. I ran into a friend
from college. We had dinner.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.700
What'd you have for dessert?

41:22.000 --> 41:23.200
You cheated on me!

41:23.200 --> 41:24.100
I did not!

41:24.100 --> 41:25.700
And besides, what if I did?

41:25.700 --> 41:26.800
You cheated on me.

41:26.800 --> 41:27.700
That's different.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.400
I'm interested in sex. You're not.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.400
I am so interested in sex.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.300
Yeah, not with me.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.900
Yeah, George. Unfortunately, you're right.

41:33.900 --> 41:34.900
Not with you.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.000
Anne!

41:36.200 --> 41:37.800
How could you not be interested in sex
with me?

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
I'm your husband.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.200
We had great sex for years!

41:40.200 --> 41:41.600
That's the one thing we had in common.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.300
We both love having sex with each other!

41:43.300 --> 41:45.300
- George, the girls.
- Oh, yeah, the girls.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.500
That's how we had the girls - great sex.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.000
Amy was conceived under a full moon
on a surfboard,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.200
and Ashley was conceived in a graveyard
at midnight.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.000
Wow.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.400
You know, I forgot about that.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.600
That explains a lot.

41:57.700 --> 41:58.900
How could you forget that?

41:59.200 --> 42:01.400
Daniel Hoffstadler. We were on his grave.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.100
Daniel Hoffstadler.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.300
Yeah.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.800
I don't understand.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.100
What happened to us?

42:07.100 --> 42:08.500
I don't know, George.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.100
I don't know.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.100
You don't know?

42:11.100 --> 42:14.000
Well, I did think that I lost all interest
in sex,

42:14.200 --> 42:15.500
but as it turns out -

42:16.300 --> 42:17.700
I'm really sorry to say this to you -

42:17.700 --> 42:20.700
I just lost all interest in sex with you.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.100
Because I cheated?

42:22.500 --> 42:23.400
No.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.600
I think I knew on some level you
were doing it,

42:26.600 --> 42:29.100
but I didn't want to deal with it,
because on another level,

42:29.100 --> 42:30.100
I didn't care.

42:30.100 --> 42:33.100
'Cause you were leaving me alone,
and I was kind of happy about that.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.100
But I knew that something wasn't right.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.800
Well, if it wasn't the cheating,
what was it?

42:37.800 --> 42:40.400
I don't know. There was no big thing
exactly. It's -

42:41.000 --> 42:43.400
OK, you remember a couple years ago
when I made you lunch -

42:43.400 --> 42:46.100
I made you a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich and I put ??? to go with it,

42:46.100 --> 42:48.500
and you asked for a bag of Cheese Nuffs
instead?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.300
- No.
- Well, you did.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.800
And I think that it was at that exact
moment when I realized

42:54.300 --> 42:56.100
I didn't want to have sex with you
anymore.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.100
I didn't want to talk to you anymore.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.600
I didn't want to be with you anymore.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.400
Because of the Cheese Nuffs?

43:02.400 --> 43:04.100
No. No. It was just -

43:05.400 --> 43:08.500
It's just that it seemed like no matter
what I did for you,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.700
it was never enough, or it wasn't right,
or...

43:12.900 --> 43:13.700
I don't know.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.400
Only now I don't care.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.000
You know that there's any big reason.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.900
There just is what is, and...

43:23.400 --> 43:24.700
what is is I -

43:25.600 --> 43:27.800
I don't want to be married to you anymore,
George.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.700
I'm sorry. I wish I did.

43:29.900 --> 43:32.100
I wish I wanted to work this out,
but I don't.
