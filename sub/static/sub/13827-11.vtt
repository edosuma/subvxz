So You're A Totally Different Person.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.363
Come on Hat. Girls don't like to read

15:04.488 --> 15:05.989
What will make her happy?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.493
Oh fine, Mr. Smarty Hat,

15:09.743 --> 15:12.204
What's was the one thing
she likes the least?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.706
Ah (GLASS BREAKING)
Just give me what I need

15:14.790 --> 15:15.916
Breath mints?

15:18.377 --> 15:19.419
Come on, buddy.

15:19.545 --> 15:22.005
If your old hat's gone,
we will you find a new one

15:22.089 --> 15:23.507
you'll like just as much.

15:23.757 --> 15:27.302
I forthwith hereby proclaim
this hat to be mysti-greeable

15:27.469 --> 15:32.140
pip-pip. It is merely a
construct of the mind. Is it not?

15:32.474 --> 15:36.061
Hat's great, best headpiece!

15:36.144 --> 15:38.355
Why I do declare...

15:50.784 --> 15:54.538
Hallelujah

15:59.209 --> 16:01.587
Get it Wander. That one is perfect.

16:01.670 --> 16:02.713
Do you feel better?

16:03.338 --> 16:06.675
But... my hat!

16:08.677 --> 16:12.222
(WANDER SCREAMS)

16:21.064 --> 16:26.612
So Hat, if you won't give me what I want,
you shall feel the wrath of my... Hot rack

16:26.695 --> 16:27.696
Good one, me.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.033
HATER: Now, go! (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
Gimme something or go!

16:33.952 --> 16:37.831
Fuzzy, Pink. Now we're talking!
More, More!

16:37.915 --> 16:39.499
Give me more stuff girl's like.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.543
Lipstick. Exotic. A bag of glitter

16:42.127 --> 16:44.046
Dominator will love these.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.591
What else? I know, a Unicorn.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.801
Yes!

16:50.093 --> 16:52.429
So stupid, So girly.

16:55.057 --> 16:58.852
(CRYING) Ah!

17:01.480 --> 17:02.523
Okay. Okay!

17:02.606 --> 17:04.316
You want your old hat back!

17:04.566 --> 17:06.944
I want to like these, Sylvia. I really do.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.863
But they don't have that same magic.

17:09.947 --> 17:13.575
Somebody say magic, we sell those

17:15.285 --> 17:19.289
firm tall, voluminous.
Can we pull stuff out of it?

17:19.456 --> 17:20.958
Of course, go ahead.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.586
Sylvia, look, just like my hat.

17:24.670 --> 17:28.131
What else will it give you? Items that
you need and not what you want,

17:28.215 --> 17:30.759
forcing you to improvise,
take things as they come.

17:30.843 --> 17:34.221
A physical manifestation of challenges we
all face in life. A banjo?

17:34.304 --> 17:35.639
Pretty much handkerchiefs.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.560
-But it's magic...
-But not real magical.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.438
You know, how rare those are. Son,
if I had a real magic hat

17:43.522 --> 17:45.524
I'll never let it out of my sight, ever.

17:52.239 --> 17:57.244
-This is Dominator
-(HATER LAUGHS)

17:57.703 --> 18:02.207
Hey, Hat, monogram some His
and Her towels for me, thanks.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.132
Sir, a Unicorn is chewing up
the engine room.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.884
What is going on?

18:11.967 --> 18:15.137
Oh, is that what I think it is?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.805
It's not a magical mystical hat

18:16.889 --> 18:20.058
that gives you anything you want
If that's what you're implying

18:20.142 --> 18:23.061
Shut up, its mine.
I needed to conquer Dominator's heart.

18:23.187 --> 18:26.481
Conquer heart? We can use this
to actually conquer her

18:26.607 --> 18:29.109
But it's really good at making
lady presents.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.235
Forget presents!

18:30.360 --> 18:32.237
We can make super weapons.

18:32.362 --> 18:39.077
Night gowns, baby dolls and lake hair wax.
She will be mine!

18:39.203 --> 18:42.873
Weapons, I do get the laser blasters
and sonic cannons.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.625
The universe will be mine.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.628
(CRASHES)

18:54.301 --> 18:55.385
Uh-ooh!

19:02.309 --> 19:04.353
PEEPERS: (SCREAMING)

19:06.146 --> 19:07.773
Really? You're sure you're fine?

19:07.856 --> 19:12.486
Yeah. I just have to face we're not going
to find my hat and I'll never replace it.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.531
But knowing that old hat,
it's probably out there

19:15.614 --> 19:17.282
helping some other deserving soul

19:17.366 --> 19:18.825
Who needs it more than me.

19:18.909 --> 19:23.080
I guess from now on,
I'm just regular old Wander

19:23.413 --> 19:25.874
the guy with nothing on his noggin.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.710
Did not see that coming.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.766
-My hat!
-Woah, woah!

19:42.850 --> 19:44.935
What makes you think the hat is up there?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.688
Because this is exactly
what happened when I stole it.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.731
When you what? You stole something?

19:49.898 --> 19:50.941
Back in my past.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.819
I wandered to a galaxy
in the middle of a civil war.

19:55.153 --> 19:58.448
Two former allies discovered the hat
to give them wonderful things

19:58.532 --> 20:01.243
but they got too greedy
and turned against each other.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.088
In an attempt to conquer the galaxy.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.841
They forced the hat to give them
whatever they wanted

20:15.924 --> 20:18.635
without a thought to help the
poor, helpless

20:20.262 --> 20:22.014
I felt so bad for it.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.765
I did the only thing I could.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.476
I took it and kept it safe on my head.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.770
Eventually he'll learn to trust me.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.355
It was nice enough to help me.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.774
And right now we need to help it.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.444
But how? We don't have Orbble juice.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.634
What do we do? What do we know?

20:59.718 --> 21:01.970
Sir, get grip on the hat

21:02.054 --> 21:04.139
but I don't think that's the perfect plan

21:06.934 --> 21:08.185
My Hat!

21:08.560 --> 21:09.811
Hey, Hater.

21:10.187 --> 21:14.399
I was wondering if it's not
too much trouble if I could get my...

21:14.566 --> 21:16.443
-Take it.
-Oh, hey thanks!

21:16.652 --> 21:18.820
-Sure, no problem
-That's really nice of you

21:18.946 --> 21:20.948
-Fine.
-Okay

21:21.073 --> 21:23.659
-Okay
-Okay

21:23.784 --> 21:25.869
-Okay fine. Just get out of here.
-Okay

21:30.332 --> 21:35.337
This hat may give me whatever I need, but
turns out, what I really need is my hat

21:42.302 --> 21:44.429
looks like it needs you too, pal!
