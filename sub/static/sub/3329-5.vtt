00:01.200 --> 00:02.360
Previously on Elementary:

00:02.400 --> 00:03.492
HOLMES:
Is it possible

00:03.530 --> 00:05.418
to truly know another person?

00:05.470 --> 00:07.290
Is it even
a worthwhile pursuit?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.489
You think
that Kitty needs help

00:08.540 --> 00:10.030
above and beyond
my mentorship?

00:10.070 --> 00:11.537
She's a rape victim.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.299
She was kept and tortured.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.104
What, you found
your next business?
I think so.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.539
So, I called the airline, and
I can't stay the whole time,

00:18.580 --> 00:20.445
but I've always wanted
to see Copenhagen.

00:24.820 --> 00:27.789
WOMAN:
Yeah.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.788
I hear you.

00:29.830 --> 00:34.119
I told him we'd be ready
to brief next Wednesday.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.765
Oh, believe me, if he pushes
back, I'll kill him myself.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.791
Uh, hold on, I'll check.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.238
(scoffs)

00:43.270 --> 00:45.568
Damn it.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.601
Dan, I'll call you back.

00:58.390 --> 01:00.585
(screams)

01:04.330 --> 01:05.479
(beeps)

01:05.530 --> 01:07.691
Bastard.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.267
It's a nondisclosure
agreement.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.699
I would like
you to Sign It.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.368
Morning to you, too.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.664
It is, for the most
part, boilerplate.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.668
My secrets stay secret.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.177
I have powerful
enemies, Kitty.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.700
I work every day
to make more.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.844
You are priw to my
method and my madness.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.348
So, you see the risk I'm
taking on, do you not?

01:25.380 --> 01:27.814
I do, but we've worked
together for months,

01:27.850 --> 01:29.442
so why, all of a s...

01:29.490 --> 01:31.344
I meant to have your
signature from the beginning,

01:31.390 --> 01:33.358
but timely paperwork
is a weakness of mine.

01:36.390 --> 01:40.121
I hereby forego my right
to tell my nonexistent friends

01:40.160 --> 01:43.129
that I am pet-sitting
a sociopathic tortoise.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.364
Hmm.

01:48.770 --> 01:51.739
Does seem to favor the buzzer
over the bell lately.

01:51.770 --> 01:54.534
When I feed him, he'd rather
zap for his breakfast.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.878
Hmm. It's only
a small sample,

01:56.910 --> 01:59.470
but there is mounting evidence
that he wishes you harm.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.408
(cell phone chimes)
We'll need more
data to say

02:01.450 --> 02:04.419
whether or not reptiles
have the capacity for empathy.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.418
Until Watson returns
from Copenhagen,

02:06.460 --> 02:07.813
Clyde will
either warm to you,

02:07.860 --> 02:09.851
or the electrocutions
wrll continue.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.321
Gather your things.
We're needed in Midtown.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.297
Guarding a puddle?

02:18.670 --> 02:19.898
Been demoted, have you?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.635
Haven't you heard?

02:21.670 --> 02:23.831
It's not the size of
the crime scene that counts.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.179
All we got is this
and what's in that bag.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.340
Ooh.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.177
BELL: _ _
CSU already dId their thing,

02:34.220 --> 02:35.619
but the thunderstorm
last night

02:35.650 --> 02:37.447
washed away
most of the story.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.514
Witnesses?

02:38.550 --> 02:39.756
Well, we got
detectives

02:39.790 --> 02:41.280
canvassing the neighborhood,

02:41.320 --> 02:43.481
but it doesn't look like
anyone saw the accrdent

02:43.530 --> 02:45.589
or torture or
whatever this was.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.655
Still waiting to hear back
from a few hospitals.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.918
But, so far, no reports
of a handless man

02:49.970 --> 02:51.767
coming into the ER last night.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.769
Nor will there be any.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.769
The owner of this hand
is quite dead.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.506
I have a fair idea where
we'll find the rest of him.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.202
You will have seen the signs
near the puddle of blood

03:03.250 --> 03:06.219
that said-- overnight parking
prohibited on a Monday.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.241
And yet this morning--
rubbish everywhere.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.339
So it's not too much
of a leap to imagine

03:10.390 --> 03:11.880
that the street sweeper
had to maneuver

03:11.920 --> 03:13.683
around an illegally parked car.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.223
A car which was later towed.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.455
Given the givens,
you can see how a severed hand

03:18.490 --> 03:20.890
came to be lying in the
middle of the street.

03:20.930 --> 03:23.296
You want to give us
the "givens" one more time?

03:23.330 --> 03:26.788
It starts at this Prius,
goes up to the column.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.489
Right.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.968
The hand was not
cut cleanly.

03:35.010 --> 03:38.969
It wasn't lopped off
with a sharp blade.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.444
The stump was
a jagged mess.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.289
I picture
the man lying,

03:43.320 --> 03:46.209
stuffed beneath
a parked car, dead.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.826
Sled of the tow truck
was lowered...

03:53.360 --> 03:55.328
...onto his wrist.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.896
And then your puddle
became a stew.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.296
But why do you keep
saying he was dead?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.638
He could have been
a drunkard lying by the curb

04:01.670 --> 04:03.365
with his hand
where it shouldn't be.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.800
If I cut your hand off,
you'd scream, wouldn't you?

04:06.840 --> 04:09.968
So, a tow truck crew
working in a downpour

04:10.010 --> 04:12.740
could be forgiven for not
seeing what they'd done,

04:12.780 --> 04:14.919
but...

04:14.950 --> 04:18.340
the only way that they
wouldn't have heard anything

04:18.390 --> 04:20.358
is if the man
was already deceased.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.359
So, you think the body
got caught underneath,

04:23.390 --> 04:25.278
dragged here by the tow truck?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.396
I don't think, Detective.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.530
I know.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.680
You ought to get cleaned up,
get back to your command.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.527
I'm free to go?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.994
Yeah, you can go.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.698
Look, I'm sure you
had your reasons.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.709
But unless
you share 'em,

05:10.740 --> 05:12.879
I got an official
mess on my hands.

05:12.910 --> 05:15.333
I'm not asking for any favors.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.348
You do what you have to do.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.348
Damn it, Tommy, you hit a cop.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.041
I know what I did.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.687
WOMAN:
No wallet, no I.D., so he's
a John Doe until further notice.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.051
Also, he's a
homicide victim.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.398
I seem to remember telling
you that this morning.

05:36.430 --> 05:38.091
Someone hit him hard
with a blunt instrument.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.360
As I also pointed out.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.868
Brain hemorrhaging-- pretty
extensive on the left side.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.662
This was the fatal blow,

05:44.710 --> 05:46.132
ifI had to guess,
but it was

05:46.170 --> 05:47.706
a rough ride
under that car.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.947
Lots of postmortem
injuries,

05:49.980 --> 05:51.948
including the
severed hand.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.517
I'm just amazed he didn't get
jarred loose from under there.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.074
The undercarriage
hooked his belt buckle.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.781
We_had to cut
him loose.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.015
So, he got attacked
on the street,

06:00.060 --> 06:01.413
his wallet is gone.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.859
Mugging gone wrong?

06:02.890 --> 06:05.586
Whatever it was,
he put up a fight.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.598
Some of the bruising, including
the torn rotator cuff,

06:07.630 --> 06:09.029
wasn't postmortem.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.096
And I found a
decent sample

06:11.130 --> 06:13.860
of what I assume is the
perp's blood and skin

06:13.900 --> 06:15.561
under the left
index finger.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.136
No hits in the
system yet.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.178
No hair.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.677
Not even in his nose.

06:21.710 --> 06:25.168
And those, um, holes
near his shoulder...

06:25.210 --> 06:27.440
Chemo?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.016
From the looks of it,

06:29.050 --> 06:31.086
he was on a pretty aggressive
course of treatment,

06:31.120 --> 06:32.587
and it was working.

06:32.620 --> 06:36.112
I didn't find one
gram of carcmoma.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.755
He had a bone graft in his
hip-- healed beautifully.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.769
Might be worth it to show his
picture around a few hospitals.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.462
After we've checked
the Orthodox synagogues.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.468
This man's clothes
may be in tatters,

06:47.500 --> 06:49.934
but these holes are tailored,

06:49.970 --> 06:51.938
sewn in to hold tzitzit.

06:51.970 --> 06:53.176
The ritual fringe worn

06:53.210 --> 06:55.770
by devout Jewish men.

06:55.810 --> 06:57.641
22 such synagogues in Manhattan.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.147
You take everything
south of Houston,

06:59.180 --> 07:00.943
we'll take everything north.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.619
HOLMES: We're not certain
he was a victim of mugging.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.481
It's just one
possibility.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.885
Did your brother have
any enemies

07:06.920 --> 07:08.888
or anyone who might have
wanted to hurt him?

07:08.920 --> 07:12.856
No. Like I said,
Moshe was a good man.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.858
He was loved here.

07:15.900 --> 07:20.860
Fact is-- we didn't think we'd
have him as long as we did.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.538
The-the bone cancer.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.538
But Moshe kept faith.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.130
Just last month,

07:27.180 --> 07:30.001
they told him
it was in remission.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.200
The medical examiner puts
your brother's time of death

07:32.250 --> 07:34.172
at around 2:00 am.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.176
Was it usual for him
to be out that late?

07:36.220 --> 07:41.180
I assumed he-he went to check
something at his store.

07:41.220 --> 07:43.984
He owned a Postal Unlimited,

07:44.030 --> 07:46.089
one block from where you say
he was attacked.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.089
Moshe's usually the one
who opens up in the morning.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.096
I was afraid he was
under the weather again.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.802
If he came in last night, it'd
be in the system over there.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.028
The master code,
it's just one-two-three

08:01.080 --> 08:02.547
and then the address.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.501
Was Moshe a good boss?

08:03.550 --> 08:05.745
Yeah, he was the best.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.113
He was really tight with
his community, and still...

08:09.150 --> 08:10.686
hired a guy named Amit.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.278
He had a big heart.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.083
You got any idea
what would have drawn him

08:14.120 --> 08:15.212
to the office last night?

08:15.260 --> 08:17.820
(sighs)
It could have been anything.

08:17.860 --> 08:21.523
There were signs of a-a
struggle, violent struggle.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.528
Possibly personal.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.937
So, have you any idea of any
acquaintances might have...

08:26.970 --> 08:28.528
lured him here?

08:28.570 --> 08:30.959
Sorry, I just work the counter.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.535
You working here
last night at 1:00 am?

08:33.580 --> 08:34.933
It's finals week.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.574
I was in a study group
literally all night.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.572
Like I said,
I loved Moshe.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.042
If it wasn't for him
and this job,

08:42.080 --> 08:43.980
I wouldn't be able
to pay for grad school.

08:55.600 --> 09:00.594
What is that?
That is a GX-100 safe.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.904
Rather expensive
and new edition,

09:02.940 --> 09:05.033
judging by the sawdust
on the floor here.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.868
Alarm system's new, too.

09:07.910 --> 09:10.071
Quite a few security upgrades
in the last few months.

09:10.110 --> 09:13.045
There were a couple robberies
in the neighborhood this summer.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.776
So, you want to bet whether
Moshe's nigh-uncrackable

09:15.820 --> 09:17.788
security code is
put to a double use?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.651
Hmm?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.555
At least it wasn't his birthday.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.963
Little more careful
with the books.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.602
He was keeping
a coded ledger.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.629
AMIT: I think
that's just Hebrew.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.648
Some of it.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.375
We're gonna need copies of
all account documentation

09:45.410 --> 09:48.379
and any shipping manifests
that you have in the store.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.887
(tapping on window)

09:51.350 --> 09:52.612
Captain?

09:52.660 --> 09:54.651
Got a minute?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.618
You're a son of a bitch,
you know that?

10:03.670 --> 10:05.626
I told you what
I told you in confidence.

10:05.670 --> 10:07.638
I told you because
I had to tell someone,

10:07.670 --> 10:09.297
not because I wanted you
to jump my partner

10:09.340 --> 10:12.161
in the middle of the street
in front of half my precinct.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.201
He didn't get half
of what he deserved.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.673
Well, I got the whole 15th--

10:15.710 --> 10:17.302
people who had no idea
what was going on--

10:17.350 --> 10:19.079
trying to figure out
why you did it.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.317
You're not saying
anything.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.045
Stotz isn't saying anything.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.183
But I'm hearing whispers
everywhere I go this morning.

10:25.220 --> 10:28.155
This is worse
than what happened.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.351
The guy laid hands on you.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.153
Did you honestly

10:32.190 --> 10:34.397
expect me to do nothing?

10:34.430 --> 10:37.365
I am not nine years old
anymore, Dad.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.665
I'm a cop.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.702
I can handle myself.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.175
No, that's...

10:56.220 --> 10:57.187
that's mine.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.211
You use another one.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.717
You always let
me use that one.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.978
There's a brand-new one
in your room.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.782
I meant to tell you,
and I forgot.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.452
All right, out with it.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.459
First, you make me sign an NDA,
now I can't use your laptop.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.968
We worked together for months,
and today I wake up to find

11:14.000 --> 11:15.433
I'm learning at the
knee of a paranoid.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.961
Paranoia is the byproduct
of being consistently right.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.001
You should aspire to it.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.448
Sherlock?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.471
(sighs)

11:27.520 --> 11:30.409
If you must know, I am raw
from a recent violation.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.079
It's come to my attention
that my last protge

11:36.120 --> 11:38.987
was engaged
in literary espionage.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.764
The Casebook of
Sherlock Holmes?

11:44.800 --> 11:47.030
Watson wrote this?

11:47.070 --> 11:49.834
I lent her that computer in the
early days of our partnership.

11:49.870 --> 11:53.328
When I got it back,
I found a 474-page manuscript,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.007
inadequately trashed

11:55.040 --> 11:58.942
and all too easy
to recover.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.845
She wrote a book about you.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.518
My work, my methods.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.108
And God only knows
if she's retained copies.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.515
But rest assured,
I shall demand them all

12:05.550 --> 12:09.350
when she returns from her
Danish sabbatical/sex-capade.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.483
In any event, you can see
why I find it necessary

12:11.530 --> 12:15.057
to circumscribe _
a razor-sharp cone of Silence.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.761
I get why you're unhappy,

12:16.800 --> 12:18.461
but it's not like she's
published the thing.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.865
Oh, you would defend her.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.367
I say she has a right

12:21.400 --> 12:24.039
to make record of her
work and her stories.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.958
Interesting title for her
stories, don't you think?

12:26.010 --> 12:27.409
The Casebook
of Sherlock Holmes?

12:27.440 --> 12:29.374
Maybe she...

12:29.410 --> 12:31.901
It was diamonds.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.417
Diamonds.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.056
Sherlock...

12:41.090 --> 12:43.058
Thank you for provoking me.
I needed to purge.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.558
Anger can be a potent fuel,
but it does cloud the mind.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.797
And once removed-- sunburst.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.798
Moshe Shapiro was
a diamond smuggler.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.229
You decrypted the ledger?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.828
Nope.

12:52.870 --> 12:55.395
But these shipping manifests
are in plain English,

12:55.440 --> 12:58.136
and they tell the
story well enough.

12:58.170 --> 13:01.401
Starting last February,
one of Moshe's customers,

13:01.440 --> 13:03.305
George Anyaoku,
started receiving

13:03.350 --> 13:05.477
registered letters from
a doctor in Tel Aviv.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.910
Anyaoku was a
UN. translator

13:07.950 --> 13:10.089
with the Nigerian delegation.
I say "was"...

13:10.120 --> 13:12.816
because he suffered
a coronary

13:12.860 --> 13:15.488
and died last...

13:15.520 --> 13:17.056
January.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.320
Now, obviously payments
for his mailbox ceased,

13:19.360 --> 13:20.918
but Moshe kept it open-- why?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.496
Because he knew that this man's

13:22.530 --> 13:24.259
diplomatic connections entitled

13:24.300 --> 13:26.393
his correspondence to less
scrutiny from customs.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.931
But how can you be sure
it was diamonds?

13:27.970 --> 13:29.494
Well, firstly,
Tel Aviv is a hub

13:29.540 --> 13:31.599
for the international market
for conflict diamonds.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.609
Secondly, Moshe's new safe does
not come with a fabric lining.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.006
He had it inlaid with
duvetyn for the same reason

13:37.050 --> 13:38.369
that jewelers use black velvet.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.071
He wanted to be able to see

13:40.120 --> 13:42.577
any small stones which had
slipped from their pouches.

13:42.620 --> 13:45.088
It's a bit of a shame to learn

13:45.120 --> 13:47.259
we're seeking justice
for a scoundrel.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.609
And a hypocrite.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.025
At least, according to this.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.254
I thought you
couldn't read that.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.599
I can't, but there
is a grease stain

13:53.630 --> 13:55.291
on page 124.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.298
This is rmoulade from a very

13:57.330 --> 13:59.560
un-kosher shrimp po'boy.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.033
That's a sandwich.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.560
It wouldn't be the
first time a man's

14:03.610 --> 14:05.032
looming sense of
his own mortality

14:05.070 --> 14:07.607
had loosened his
sense of piety.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.108
So, on the last Wednesday
of every month,

14:10.150 --> 14:12.175
he received a shipment of gems.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.871
It seems his habit
was to sell them

14:13.920 --> 14:15.319
onto a wholesaler
after hours.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.341
_ And then someone
figured out his schedule

14:17.390 --> 14:18.982
and saw an easy score.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.908
Hmm, there are only so
many diamond merchants

14:20.960 --> 14:22.609
who would be willing to
purchase undocumented stones.

14:22.660 --> 14:26.221
I suggest we see how many
the NYPD is aware of.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.497
BELL:
One more for the pile.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.589
Emerald Avenue
Fine Jewelry and Gems.

14:31.630 --> 14:33.063
Owner's been clean
in this country

14:33.100 --> 14:35.239
but took a collar in Nairobi

14:35.270 --> 14:37.465
a couple years back
with a bag of rubies

14:37.510 --> 14:39.205
taped to his upper thigh.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.377
Fair warning--
there's a picture

14:40.410 --> 14:43.072
in there you can't unsee.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.544
Holmes, where are you, man?

14:50.720 --> 14:53.018
Excuse me. Would you...
would you repeat that last bit

14:53.060 --> 14:54.914
you just said
about the briefcase in the box?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.484
How did you even know...?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.521
H can read lips.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.050
Would you, uh... please?

14:59.090 --> 15:01.092
Mm-hmm.

15:06.370 --> 15:07.598
All right, careful.
That's evidence.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.629
In our investigation,

15:08.670 --> 15:09.967
I take it.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.466
You want a go?

15:14.340 --> 15:16.501
Where'd you say it came from--
Department of Sanitation?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.405
Yeah, uh, a couple of their guys

15:18.450 --> 15:20.668
saw it in a bin on
515t and Broadway.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.608
Other half of that handcuff
is a bloody mess.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.083
They figured we
should take a look,

15:24.120 --> 15:26.247
so I got to climb into
a Dumpster this morning.

15:26.290 --> 15:28.315
Yeah, we can tell.

15:35.030 --> 15:37.123
BELL:
Wow.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.196
I guess we know why
Moshe Shapiro lost his hand.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.265
They took it off to get
to the briefcase.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.439
The briefcase full of diamonds.

15:44.470 --> 15:47.109
So, if someone threw it
in a Dumpster...

15:47.140 --> 15:49.199
Then it wasn't just
a simple robbery after all.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.242
We're back to square one.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.083
(bell buzzes)
HOLMES:
Enter!

15:59.120 --> 16:00.280
(door opens)

16:00.320 --> 16:01.958
(door closes)

16:04.490 --> 16:06.151
If you asked me to come here

16:06.190 --> 16:08.294
for some messed-up
puppet show...

16:15.040 --> 16:16.439
HOLMES:
495 pounds.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.569
That's the force
it would take to pull

16:19.610 --> 16:21.373
the hand off
a withered cancer survivor.

16:21.410 --> 16:24.174
Provided, of course, you had
already broken his wrist.

16:24.210 --> 16:26.644
You think someone ripped
Moshe Shapiro's hand off?

16:26.680 --> 16:28.045
With their bare hands?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.217
Mm-hmm.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.217
The killer

16:30.250 --> 16:31.683
pulled on the briefcase

16:31.720 --> 16:33.381
which was attached
to the vic's wrist,

16:33.420 --> 16:35.183
and...
(clicks tongue)

16:35.220 --> 16:36.482
That's not the sound it makes.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.657
You know you're talking about

16:37.690 --> 16:39.089
almost a quarter of a ton.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.154
There are weightlifters

16:40.200 --> 16:42.259
who are more than up
to the task.

16:42.300 --> 16:45.326
I've become convinced that one
such behemoth is our culprit.

16:45.370 --> 16:48.498
There was considerable blood
and viscera on the handcuff

16:48.540 --> 16:50.235
attached to
Moshe's briefcase.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.498
This method
best explains that

16:51.540 --> 16:53.303
and the grisly amputation

16:53.340 --> 16:56.138
far better than my initial
tow truck hypothesis.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.341
Look, I don't want to be
the reason you rob a morgue,

16:58.380 --> 17:00.041
but that's not a real person.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.274
Nor is it a cheap toy.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.311
Each one has been calibrated

17:03.350 --> 17:05.580
to mimic the integrity
of a human joint.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.110
As you can see,
I've double-checked

17:07.160 --> 17:09.811
these findings,
and the ME. concurs.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.351
Pulling a hand off
a broken wrist is just within

17:12.390 --> 17:13.493
the range of human potential.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.828
How many humans we talking about

17:15.860 --> 17:18.192
with that kind of... potential?

17:18.230 --> 17:20.266
Probably not as many
as we found online

17:20.300 --> 17:23.064
claiming to have
clean-and-jerked 500 pounds.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.509
But just to be safe,

17:24.540 --> 17:27.373
I've dispatched Kitty
to run the braggarts' names

17:27.410 --> 17:28.809
through the NYPD database.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.341
And if someone with this power

17:30.380 --> 17:32.143
hasn't bothered to publicize it?

17:32.180 --> 17:34.842
I'm hoping we'll find him
at Richie's Gym.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.781
It's one of New _York's
preeminent weightlifting meccas.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.845
And it just so happens
to be two blocks

17:39.890 --> 17:42.358
from the site
of Moshe Shapiro's murder.

17:45.490 --> 17:48.357
(siren in the distance)

17:51.900 --> 17:55.233
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.737
I just wanted to make sure

17:56.770 --> 17:58.465
Captain Moretti
connected with you.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.375
You know what he's
asking me to do, right?

18:00.410 --> 18:04.141
He wants me to find
that piece of garbage.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.772
He wants me to shake his hand...

18:05.810 --> 18:07.368
In front of cops.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.719
Like you attacked him
in front of cops.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.445
It's a gesture.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.151
Everyone will know
that the thing

18:14.190 --> 18:16.283
between you and him is...
is done.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.423
They'll let it go.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.224
The thing between
me and Stotz is you.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.797
You know better than to get
involved with your partner.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.331
I taught you better than that.

18:27.370 --> 18:28.769
Nobody had any idea about us

18:28.800 --> 18:31.360
until you came down
and starting beating on him.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.503
How many times has he
gotten physical with you?

18:33.540 --> 18:35.576
Huh?

18:35.610 --> 18:37.475
Hannah, I know guys like this.

18:37.510 --> 18:40.411
I've been putting them
in jail for 30 years.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.419
I want to get something
really clear, okay?

18:43.450 --> 18:46.840
I am not some battered woman.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.415
I'm not some crazy lady that
calls the cops on her boyfriend,

18:49.460 --> 18:51.849
and then tries to attack them
when they take him away.

18:51.890 --> 18:53.858
When I say it happened
two times,

18:53.900 --> 18:56.323
it happened two times.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.399
Stotz and I are done.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.489
But your bosses still
don't know the truth.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.361
I want to be promoted
just as bad as the next cop,

19:04.410 --> 19:06.401
and I'm not just talking
about detective.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.409
I want to be captain
someday like you.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.840
But it's never gonna happen
if people look at me

19:11.880 --> 19:13.711
and they see victim.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.441
You don't talk about it,
he could do it again.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.685
To you or to somebody else.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.257
Is that the kind of guy
you want in your department

19:22.290 --> 19:23.450
when you're helping run it?

19:23.490 --> 19:25.583
I'll tell you what I want.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.689
I want you at roll call

19:27.730 --> 19:29.925
at the 15th on Friday.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.894
Shaking his hand.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.591
Putting this to bed.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.902
*

19:40.380 --> 19:41.904
KITTY:
No luck at the precinct.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.646
Competitive weightlifters
are a surprisingly

19:43.680 --> 19:45.545
law-abiding bunch.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.719
There were a couple
of arrests for possession.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.718
You can guess which drug.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.843
But nothing violent.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.517
What have I missed?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.653
The manager's on his way.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.989
He said he would inform us
of any unsavory characters

19:59.030 --> 20:02.557
that might frequent
this dreary sweatbox.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.522
In the meantime, Detective
Bell is taking a tour

20:04.570 --> 20:06.663
with a pneumatic
model-cum-trainer.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.863
I'm sure he's been persuaded
to get a membership already.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.737
Shame I don't have
The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes

20:15.780 --> 20:18.840
to entertain me.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.917
What is Watson like
as an author?

20:21.950 --> 20:23.679
Subject matter's interesting.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.688
But her prose is prosaic.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.449
At least it was
on the first page.

20:27.490 --> 20:28.855
It gets better from there?
I don't know.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.450
I've only read
the first page.

20:31.490 --> 20:33.594
You've only read the first page?
Look who's here.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.689
Dana Kazmir.

20:35.730 --> 20:38.324
One of our boastful beasts.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.338
You might recall him from
the photo he posted

20:40.370 --> 20:42.031
of himself clean-and-jerking
532 pounds

20:42.070 --> 20:45.301
on BodyByPain.com's
message forum.

20:45.340 --> 20:47.808
He didn't have any priors,
not even a parking ticket.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.638
He does, however, have a
scrape on his left hand.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.671
Should I get...?

20:53.750 --> 20:55.615
Dana Kazmir?

20:55.650 --> 20:56.878
Sorry.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.808
Now's not a good time
for an autograph.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.715
Well, perhaps we could
discuss a murder instead.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.582
Man named Moshe Shapiro
was found dead yesterday.

21:04.630 --> 21:05.858
Someone pulled off his hand.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.653
Someone with
extraordinary strength.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.429
Someone like... like you.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.395
You mind telling us how you
got that scratch on your hand?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.535
Who the hell are you anyway?

21:15.570 --> 21:16.992
We're consultants
for the NYPD.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.531
You got badges?
No.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.605
Well, then I don't
have to talk to you.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.631
Our colleague has a badge.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.375
Perhaps you'd like
to speak with him.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.570
(sighs)

21:25.610 --> 21:27.419
Perhaps you should
get out of my face.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.418
Mr. Kazmir, I challenge you
to a test of strength.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.850
IfI best you at arm wrestling,

21:34.890 --> 21:36.949
then you have to submit
to further questioning.

21:36.990 --> 21:40.357
If you win...
give you 200 bucks.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.960
That's not gonna happen, of
course, 'cause I'll win easily.

21:49.470 --> 21:50.539
Oh, what are you doing?

21:50.570 --> 21:52.458
What do you think?

21:52.510 --> 21:53.875
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:53.910 --> 21:55.537
We're not a couple
of prison colonists.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.104
We're gonna arm-wrestle
like gentlemen.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.404
You're _not aware
of British rules?

21:59.450 --> 22:02.544
All right, well, the goal
is not to push your opponent's

22:02.580 --> 22:06.118
hand to the side, but rather to
pull his arm towards yourself.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.459
All right?
So when--

22:08.490 --> 22:10.720
and I emphasize "when"--
I pin the back of your hand

22:10.760 --> 22:12.751
on my chest, it will be over.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.729
Right. I'll count
down from three...
Mm-hmm.

22:16.760 --> 22:17.966
...and we
go on one.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.865
Yeah.
Three.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.595
Two. One.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.403
(all exclaiming)

22:23.440 --> 22:25.067
You win.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.463
BELL:
Hey, hey, hey.
hey, hey, hey!

22:26.510 --> 22:27.875
Calm down,
all right?

22:27.910 --> 22:29.798
You got your money.
We're leaving.

22:37.420 --> 22:40.082
What the hell
were you thinking?

22:40.120 --> 22:41.781
That we lacked probable cause

22:41.820 --> 22:43.720
to compel a DNA sample

22:43.760 --> 22:45.421
to compare to
tissue underneath

22:45.460 --> 22:47.496
Moshe Shapiro's
nails.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.022
You're welcome.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.096
(door opens)

22:55.140 --> 22:56.493
Captain.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.939
Ms. Kerr,
if you're wondering

22:57.970 --> 22:59.733
when the D.A.'s people
are gonna get here...

22:59.770 --> 23:01.772
Actually, Mr. Kazmir has decided

23:01.810 --> 23:03.505
he'd rather
not wait.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.972
He understands
that the evidence

23:05.010 --> 23:07.570
against him is compelling,
and so he's

23:07.620 --> 23:09.542
prepared to offer
a full confession,

23:09.580 --> 23:10.740
as well as other information

23:10.790 --> 23:12.519
he believes
you'll find valuable.

23:13.690 --> 23:15.578
Such as?

23:15.620 --> 23:17.759
Crimes that haven't _
happened yet, but soon Will.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.052
That's why we don't
want to wait.

23:19.090 --> 23:20.125
The information
that he has

23:20.160 --> 23:22.492
is extremely time-sensitive.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.828
Now, in exchange, I would
ask your department

23:24.870 --> 23:27.839
to take a favorable view
of our plea proposal

23:27.870 --> 23:31.761
and support lenience
within reasonable constraints.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.028
But even if you don't...

23:34.080 --> 23:35.536
this is a matter of conscience

23:35.580 --> 23:36.979
for my client.

23:40.750 --> 23:41.910
He's going to kill more people.

23:41.950 --> 23:44.043
Who is?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.012
The guy who hired me.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.518
I was paid to rob
and kill Moshe Shapiro.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.051
It made me
sick, but I...

23:51.090 --> 23:53.149
My family needed the money.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.499
You're saying this
was a paid hit?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.096
He found me on, uh,

23:58.130 --> 24:00.530
one of the weight lifting
message boards.

24:00.570 --> 24:03.607
He called, but he
wouldn't give a name.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.460
His voice was...

24:05.510 --> 24:07.205
I don't know, Dutch, maybe?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.008
And the, uh, jewels turning
up the way they did...

24:11.050 --> 24:12.779
Yeah, the Dumpster on Slst.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.072
That's where he was
gonna pick 'em up.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.519
If I'd have known
what was in that case,

24:15.550 --> 24:16.778
I would have kept 'em.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.981
I only got 50K to do it.
Cash.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.681
Can you produce
that cash?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.517
I lost it.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.959
Playing cards.

24:23.990 --> 24:26.083
I gotta say,
this is kind of convenient.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.155
You want leniency
for cooperating,

24:28.200 --> 24:29.792
only you're not
giving anyone up.

24:29.830 --> 24:31.024
Not really.
KAZMIR:
Look.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.891
I never met the guy.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.795
And I'm not telling you this
because I want a favor.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.637
I'm telling you this

24:38.670 --> 24:40.638
because he wanted me
to do it again.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.649
KERR:
We have three names...

24:43.680 --> 24:47.002
each one a target of the man

24:47.050 --> 24:49.143
who paid for
Moshe Shapiro's murder.

24:49.180 --> 24:50.886
KAZMIR:
Look, you got me, okay?

24:52.220 --> 24:54.085
But he's still out there.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.156
And as long as he is,

24:56.190 --> 24:58.750
those people
aren't safe.

25:05.770 --> 25:06.998
HOLMES:
Murder for hire.

25:07.030 --> 25:09.089
These e-mails
been authenticated?

25:09.140 --> 25:12.166
Well, our tech guys say
the time stamps are legit,

25:12.210 --> 25:14.030
but they can't trace
the employer's account.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.775
This "Mencius BlackBag,"
who ordered the hit,

25:15.810 --> 25:17.209
falsified his IP address.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.708
Of all the traits that can be
ascribed to a criminal,

25:19.750 --> 25:21.877
"tech-5am" has got to be
my least favorite.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.581
Well, how about
"bloodthirsty"?

25:23.620 --> 25:25.986
You can see they went
back and forth a couple times.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.988
Kazmir kept pitching
nonviolent stickups,

25:28.020 --> 25:30.580
but this guy
wanted Shapiro dead.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.029
"You gotta ice the putz.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.618
"No loose ends for me

25:33.660 --> 25:36.220
or there's no fat stacks
for you."

25:36.260 --> 25:38.626
When we find this man,
he should stand trial for murder

25:38.670 --> 25:40.069
and crimes against
the English language.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.034
The precise instructions
about when and where

25:42.070 --> 25:44.106
Kazmir should strike Shapiro
are telling.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.199
He certainly knew
the man's business.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.073
Well, he was a lot less specific
about his other targets.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.839
Maybe he didn't
know them as well.

25:50.880 --> 25:51.869
Where are we
With interVIews

25:51.910 --> 25:52.877
and protection
for these folks?

25:52.910 --> 25:54.116
BELL:
We got cars rolling

25:54.150 --> 25:55.913
on their primary residences;

25:55.950 --> 25:58.009
we're still trying to find
numbers and make contact.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.312
They're all civilians.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.580
No criminal records,
no obvious connections.

26:01.620 --> 26:02.917
Well, we don't
know anything about

26:02.960 --> 26:04.222
"Antonio Barr_ios"
or "Linda DeVIne,"

26:04.260 --> 26:05.955
but the third name
is familiar to us.

26:05.990 --> 26:07.696
Amit Hattengatti.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.024
So, we've apprehended the
man who murdered your boss.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.765
Did it on contract.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.337
What?

26:17.370 --> 26:19.838
Apparently, he was offered
payment for your head, as well.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.178
You were aware
of your boss's

26:21.210 --> 26:22.700
illegal diamond smuggling,

26:22.740 --> 26:23.946
were you not, Mr. Hattengatti?

26:23.980 --> 26:26.949
No. I didn't know
anything about it.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.210
And yet you don't seem surprised
to hear of its existence.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.149
Okay.

26:36.190 --> 26:38.055
He never talked about it.

26:38.090 --> 26:41.093
Last month, a guy comes
into the store, and he...

26:41.130 --> 26:43.098
he threatened Moshe.

26:43.130 --> 26:44.893
He said he would kill him.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.067
And you didn't think that

26:46.100 --> 26:47.328
that would be germane
to our case?

26:47.370 --> 26:48.928
I didn't want to point

26:48.970 --> 26:50.938
at some criminal boss guy
if it was just

26:50.970 --> 26:52.369
some sort of coincidence.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.708
I was afraid of what
he would do to me.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.037
Well, as it happens, he may

26:56.080 --> 26:57.274
very well be plotting
to kill you,

26:57.310 --> 26:59.107
so... please elaborate.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.708
(sighs)

27:00.750 --> 27:02.172
Okay.
This guy Leonard--

27:02.220 --> 27:04.780
Oostheezen, Oost-wi-zin
or something--

27:04.820 --> 27:07.084
he comes into the store
and he shoves Moshe

27:07.120 --> 27:09.179
right over there.

27:09.220 --> 27:10.687
He was yelling
about, uh,

27:10.730 --> 27:12.254
the prices
being too low,

27:12.290 --> 27:13.723
that he was spoiling the buyers.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.988
He wanted to
collude with Moshe?

27:15.030 --> 27:17.294
Fix prices on
the black market?

27:17.330 --> 27:18.922
I don't know.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.995
I asked Moshe about it,
and he said it was a big mix-up.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.804
That this Leonard guy was
some sort of jewelry dealer,

27:23.840 --> 27:26.934
and that he had Moshe
confused with someone else.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.029
I knew he was lying,
but it wasn't...

27:29.080 --> 27:31.002
any of my business.

27:32.310 --> 27:34.676
There were two
other customers in here.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.119
Uh, regulars.
Linda Devine

27:36.150 --> 27:39.085
and Tony Barrios
were here, too, I think.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.152
I'll call the captain.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.055
I'll tell him that
we know the connection

27:44.090 --> 27:46.684
between the_ names
on Kazmir's list now.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.994
HOLMES:
Leonard Oosthuizen.
Born in Johannesburg.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.998
Nonresident alien since 2008.

27:51.030 --> 27:53.089
South Africa.
Kazmir was pretty close

27:53.130 --> 27:55.030
when he said the guy on
the phone sounded Dutch.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.389
For a murder suspect,

27:56.440 --> 27:58.237
he makes some awfully
fussy bracelets.

27:58.270 --> 28:00.135
He's got a
front business.

28:00.170 --> 28:01.979
Got a write-up in
a trade magazine,

28:02.010 --> 28:03.898
and there's
a Q & A here.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.838
HOLMES:
His visa lapsed in July.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.404
That should
be enough for

28:07.450 --> 28:09.179
a state-sanctioned visit,
shouldn't it?

28:10.990 --> 28:13.049
Captain.
You got a moment?

28:13.090 --> 28:15.149
Course. Yeah. Sure.

28:23.130 --> 28:26.167
I, um... Ijust
wanted you to know

28:26.200 --> 28:29.260
that I saw you yesterday,
with your daughter.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.109
Someone hit her,

28:31.140 --> 28:32.801
and you hit him.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.138
Sherlock's training me
to read lips.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.738
I'm not great at it yet.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.041
I'd say you're pretty good.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.342
I know that she
doesn't want you

28:41.380 --> 28:42.972
to talk to anybody about it--

28:43.020 --> 28:46.080
at least not in any
official capacity--

28:46.120 --> 28:49.089
but you should talk about it.

28:52.160 --> 28:55.197
Perhaps to someone whose secrets
you've agreed to keep.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.066
You're going to do it, then.

28:59.330 --> 29:02.731
Shake this man's
hand-- Stotz.

29:04.210 --> 29:07.099
Doesn't feel like I
have much of a choice.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.439
I think you're doing
the right thing.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.301
How you feel
shouldn't be her problem.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.438
After everything
that happened to me...

29:16.480 --> 29:19.779
all my relationships were...

29:19.820 --> 29:22.050
different.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.921
My family and
my friends...

29:23.960 --> 29:25.086
they were just
trying to help,

29:25.130 --> 29:29.089
butthelook
on their faces, it...

29:29.130 --> 29:31.269
it just reminded me
that it had happened.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.295
It's one of the reasons
that I wanted to start over.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.299
I know I haven't
been here very long,

29:41.340 --> 29:44.571
but I do know
that perception matters.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.271
If she doesn't want
to look weak,

29:46.310 --> 29:48.141
then she shouldn't have to.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.114
He'll be around
her every day.

29:50.150 --> 29:53.483
She's gonna have to see him
every day.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.125
Everything that
you've done for me...

30:02.160 --> 30:04.469
it's really helped.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.331
I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

30:08.370 --> 30:10.031
You don't deserve it.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.033
BELL:
What are we looking at here,

30:14.080 --> 30:16.207
Mr. Oosthuizen?

30:16.240 --> 30:17.537
Price tag. Ballpark.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.508
I don't know.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.040
Why don't you take them
to appraisal?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.115
We'll do that.

30:23.150 --> 30:25.983
I'm gonna tell you what.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.419
I'm going to proceed
under the assumption

30:27.450 --> 30:29.509
that these diamonds
we took out of your apartment

30:29.560 --> 30:31.255
are worth more than $1,000.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.281
So we got a felony.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.195
And we got your
expired visa.

30:35.230 --> 30:36.299
You see where this is heading?

30:36.330 --> 30:39.163
A flight to Johannesburg?

30:39.200 --> 30:41.532
This isn't
a Homeland Security office.

30:41.570 --> 30:44.164
You obviously think
I can help you somehow.

30:44.210 --> 30:48.135
So what's the deal
you want to offer me?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.909
I'm willing to offer you

30:49.940 --> 30:51.339
continued residence
in the United States

30:51.380 --> 30:53.917
as our permanent guest
at Southport Correctional.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.440
That's a deal?

30:55.480 --> 30:57.175
It is.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.380
Because door _number
two isn't just

30:58.420 --> 31:00.183
extradition back
to South Africa.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.551
It's a life sentence there

31:01.590 --> 31:03.615
for trafficking
in blood diamonds.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.287
I don't know if
you read Mandela's book,

31:05.330 --> 31:08.322
but me, I'd choose the States.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.396
You can confess
to arranging the murder

31:10.430 --> 31:12.227
of Moshe Shapiro and
conspiring to murder

31:12.270 --> 31:13.931
three other
American Citizens.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.232
You do that,

31:15.270 --> 31:17.090
I don't see you
getting shipped anywhere.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.961
No. I had nothing to do
with any murder.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.329
Leonard--
No. This is
ridiculous.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.177
Moshe Shapiro and I
had no quarrel.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.644
We got three witnesses
who say just the opposite.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.342
They all saw you at his throat,
just last month.

31:29.450 --> 31:31.418
I-- yes, I went to his store.

31:31.450 --> 31:34.248
And I...
I'm a passionate man. I...

31:34.290 --> 31:36.485
I made my case
that he shouldn't,

31:36.520 --> 31:38.124
you know, foul the water.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.923
BELL:
We know.
He was lowballing you.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.326
He was selling to my buyers
under my prices.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.568
In our trade, it's not done.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.999
But listen, all that was past.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.236
Moshe called me last week.

31:48.270 --> 31:50.397
He told me he was
quitting the business.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.204
So, you see, I had no reason
to hurt the man. I...

31:53.240 --> 31:55.105
Detective, ifI may.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.471
Those gems.
Forget the appraisal.

31:56.510 --> 31:59.149
How many stacks
would they pull on the street?

31:59.180 --> 32:00.670
I don't... What?
If I was to ice you,

32:00.710 --> 32:02.416
would that be a good thing
or a bad thing?

32:02.450 --> 32:04.213
Holmes...
Don't be a putz.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.581
He's being a putz, is he not?

32:05.620 --> 32:07.349
Can I speak to
you outside?

32:11.990 --> 32:13.025
The hell was that?

32:13.060 --> 32:14.049
He didn't do it.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.249
We got three witnesses

32:15.300 --> 32:16.449
who saw him threaten Shapiro.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.967
We know he's in
the same busmess,

32:18.000 --> 32:18.967
ﬁghﬁng
for customers.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.695
Not to mention Dana Kazmir,

32:20.730 --> 32:22.595
who confirmed it's Oosthuizen's
mm on his phone calls.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.063
We also have the e-mails,
which he didn't write.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.203
He speaks English.
He's got fingers.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.071
Probably knows how
to turn on a computer.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.078
You see how strong
his accent is?

32:31.110 --> 32:33.203
His native language, Afrikaans,
is still his daily tongue.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.740
What's that got to do with it?
Putz.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.372
Ice. Stacks.

32:36.420 --> 32:37.978
The e-mails that
Kazmir's employer sent

32:38.020 --> 32:39.715
are just rife with slang
and colloquialisms.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.456
I'm going back in there--
alone--

32:41.490 --> 32:43.253
and I'm going to write
that man's confession.

32:43.290 --> 32:44.325
He won't sign it.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.120
You have the wrong man.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.127
(door closes)

32:59.040 --> 33:01.031
I propose a thought experiment.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.537
Is this a preamble to admitting
you might be wrong?

33:03.580 --> 33:05.673
Leonard Oosthuizen
did not confess this afternoon,

33:05.710 --> 33:08.076
and he did not confess
for a very good reason.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.247
He is innocent, and I am right.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.544
I challenge you
to imagine

33:12.590 --> 33:14.387
an altogether different suspect

33:14.420 --> 33:17.082
whose means and motives
fit the crime.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.681
You_mean someone else
With a Dutch accent

33:20.730 --> 33:22.527
who paid to kill
Oosthuizen's rival,

33:22.560 --> 33:23.788
and then targeted

33:23.830 --> 33:25.798
the only three Witnesses
to the confrontation?

33:25.830 --> 33:28.731
Why do you refuse to consider
the possibility that Oosthuizen

33:28.770 --> 33:31.432
was in league with a partner
who wrote the e-mails?

33:31.470 --> 33:33.233
We've wasted enough time
down that road.

33:33.270 --> 33:35.079
Whatever you may say
about Oosthuizen,

33:35.110 --> 33:36.668
he is the lord of his domain.

33:36.710 --> 33:40.043
He is the sole proprietor
of his criminal enterprise.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.412
I'm quite certain
that an independent third party

33:42.450 --> 33:44.145
is responsible.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.489
All I lack is a viable suspect.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.629
I know why you haven't
read it yet, you know.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.786
Watson's book.

33:53.830 --> 33:55.058
I haven't had the time.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.352
You're afraid.
Of?

33:57.400 --> 33:59.220
Her...

33:59.270 --> 34:01.295
assessment, her judgment.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.695
Watson_ and I had no secrets
during her time here.

34:03.740 --> 34:06.300
There were days When the walls
positively vibrated

34:06.340 --> 34:07.659
with her judgment.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.177
You didn't know
about her writing.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.632
You don't know Why
she kept it a secret.

34:10.680 --> 34:12.375
Maybe the answers

34:12.410 --> 34:14.446
lie Within.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.119
Butthen,
so may other surprises.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.845
I could read it for you,
if you like.

34:20.890 --> 34:22.619
I could, um,

34:22.660 --> 34:25.083
wave you off

34:25.130 --> 34:27.189
if it's more
than you'd care to know.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.549
The truth is, you could benefit

34:28.600 --> 34:30.556
from absorbing an account
of our casework.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.524
But Watson did not
share the manuscript.

34:33.570 --> 34:36.164
And While she may have
less exacting

34:36.200 --> 34:38.134
privacy standards than I do,

34:38.170 --> 34:40.138
she obviously intended
to dispose of it.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.478
I cannot_in
good conSCIence

34:41.510 --> 34:43.205
hand it off.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.673
Perhaps if...

34:57.620 --> 35:00.680
If it's of no interest to you,
it's of no interest to me.

35:00.730 --> 35:02.322
Either way, it's over now.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.260
We can fOCUS on the case.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.421
(laptop chirps)

35:13.510 --> 35:15.273
"Found Kazmir's 50K.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.733
"He lied about gambling it away.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.873
Unfortunately, no prints."

35:21.320 --> 35:22.776
Detective Bell.

35:22.820 --> 35:26.142
He wants me to know
that Kazmir's story checks out.

35:38.830 --> 35:41.162
Have another look
at Kazmir's payoff.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.589
The padded envelope
and the hot pink rubber bands.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.302
They're just like the ones
they sell at Postal Unlimited.

35:46.340 --> 35:49.798
As they do in several thousand
other stores in this city.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.502
What if Amit Hattengatti
was behind the murder?

35:53.850 --> 35:55.841
It's a thought experiment.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.887
Amit was the one who left
the rmoulade stain

35:59.920 --> 36:01.319
on Moshe's ledger.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.816
He's an active junior partner

36:02.860 --> 36:04.452
in the diamond
smuggling business,

36:04.490 --> 36:07.357
but then Moshe beats cancer,
and he regains his virtue.

36:07.390 --> 36:09.699
Suppose it's just
as Oosthuizen claimed,

36:09.730 --> 36:11.925
and Moshe was dismantling
the business.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.269
Wouldn't that have given Amit
the motive to try and stop him?

36:15.300 --> 36:18.531
I was counting the
ifs, but go on.

36:18.570 --> 36:20.265
I just called Richie's Gym.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.301
Amit is a member there.

36:22.340 --> 36:25.571
Perhaps he overheard Kazmir
cry poor between sets one day.

36:25.610 --> 36:27.373
Oh, What he wouldn't do
for a buck.

36:27.410 --> 36:30.345
A useful hypothetical
fits all the facts.

36:30.380 --> 36:32.416
You're leaving out
a sensible motive

36:32.450 --> 36:35.283
for Amit to have aimed
his hired killer at himself.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.548
So unless you're talking

36:36.590 --> 36:39.286
about _the most elaborate
SUIClde ever staged...

36:45.370 --> 36:48.794
It is possible we've been
looking at the shape of this

36:48.840 --> 36:51.331
completely wrong.

36:51.370 --> 36:52.530
(bell dings)

36:54.710 --> 36:55.904
BELL: _
Mr. Hattengatti,

36:55.940 --> 36:57.271
I promise this won't take long.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.675
We just need to clot a few I's,

36:58.710 --> 37:00.268
get your signature
under a statement, all right?

37:00.310 --> 37:01.277
Okay.

37:09.290 --> 37:10.655
(sighs)

37:10.690 --> 37:11.850
What's going on?

37:11.890 --> 37:13.380
You've been misled.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.022
You're actually here to confess

37:15.060 --> 37:18.427
to conspiracy, murder
and obstruction of justice.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.927
Did he see Ms. Kerr
in the conference?

37:20.970 --> 37:24.508
Mm-hmm. Seemed best that we
start With your coconspirator,

37:24.540 --> 37:25.859
seeing as she didn't
actually have anyone killed.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.434
(chuckles) I don't know

37:27.470 --> 37:28.505
what you're talking about.

37:28.540 --> 37:30.770
You are Mencius Blackbag.

37:30.810 --> 37:34.940
You sent Dana Kazmir five
fat stacks to ice your boss,

37:34.980 --> 37:36.015
presumably so you
could take over

37:36.050 --> 37:37.278
the jewelry smuggling business

37:37.320 --> 37:38.685
that you helped him build.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.951
You shouldn't steal
office supplies, Amit.

37:41.990 --> 37:45.289
HOLMES: Convincing us
you were a target,

37:45.330 --> 37:46.558
steering our investigation

37:46.590 --> 37:48.057
through your caring admission

37:48.090 --> 37:50.593
that you suspected
Moshe's competitor all along.

37:50.630 --> 37:52.791
Yeah, that was quite inspired.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.639
These two are nuts.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.434
I already told them
Oosthuizen's the guy.
Careful.

37:57.470 --> 37:59.358
'Cause you pronounced
his name correctly that time.

38:00.740 --> 38:01.968
My colleague here

38:02.010 --> 38:03.807
grew suspicious of you.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.547
I realized that you had found
a way, somehow, to bribe

38:06.580 --> 38:08.343
Kazmir's attorney.

38:08.380 --> 38:09.813
Offer her money
to offer him money

38:09.850 --> 38:12.318
to tell a certain tale,
so you were, perhaps,

38:12.350 --> 38:15.353
not as marked for death
as you appeared.

38:15.390 --> 38:16.982
KITTY: She carried _
your message to Kazmir

38:17.020 --> 38:19.454
and offered him
and his family a payday,

38:19.490 --> 38:22.459
provided his confession
included the right pieces,

38:22.500 --> 38:24.388
that he once spoke
to his employer,

38:24.430 --> 38:26.364
that said employer
sounded Dutch,

38:26.400 --> 38:28.630
and that he wanted
three Witnesses dead.

38:28.670 --> 38:31.332
Kazmir was going to prison
no matter what,

38:31.370 --> 38:33.008
so he agreed.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.634
It's a pretty smart way
to cast suspicion off yourself.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.102
And you took down a rival,
to boot.

38:37.140 --> 38:40.576
You keep talking about paydays
and bribes.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.544
I work in a mailbox store.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.684
(chuckles) You want to see
my student loans?

38:44.720 --> 38:46.347
I'm a PhD candidate.

38:46.390 --> 38:49.655
With an international
diamond connection.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.419
No one here thinks that
your univer5ity stipend

38:51.460 --> 38:53.087
paid for that
Burberry belt.

38:53.130 --> 38:54.495
That's quite a splurge.

38:54.530 --> 38:55.656
We're sure the money trail

38:55.700 --> 38:58.396
will be wide and easy to follow.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.761
Hey, chin up, Amit.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.438
You can finish your doctorate
in prison.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.461
And if you confess

39:03.500 --> 39:05.661
before Ms. Kerr does,
we'll ask the DA.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.405
to shave some time
for being so cooperative.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.737
Best hurry, though.

39:08.780 --> 39:09.929
The race is on.

39:15.050 --> 39:17.143
If I give you my supplier,

39:17.180 --> 39:19.387
will that help, too?

39:21.460 --> 39:23.587
MAN:
Have a safe tour.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.588
Take your posts.

39:25.630 --> 39:26.858
(indistinct chatter)

39:45.480 --> 39:46.640
Chris.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.648
Captain.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.454
You should know,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.491
I'm quitting the department.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.928
Last day's Friday.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.731
Cousin's got a personal
security firm in Hoboken.

40:10.770 --> 40:13.102
It's a better salary anyway.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.533
Tell her I told you, okay?

40:17.580 --> 40:19.172
Hannah will be glad to hear it.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.713
I'm not talking about her.

40:21.750 --> 40:24.844
I'm talking about your friend--
the English one.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.452
You'll tell her?

40:36.230 --> 40:37.959
GREGSON:
You're here late.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.568
I wanted to pick
through a few cold cases.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.897
I'm just leaving.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.158
I thought you'd
want to know

40:46.210 --> 40:47.939
it went well today.

40:47.970 --> 40:50.109
Hannah's happy.

40:50.140 --> 40:53.246
Moretti's off my back.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.714
I got a nice
little surprise, too.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.968
Stotz is leaving the force.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.246
Glad to hear it all worked out.

41:01.290 --> 41:04.009
(elevator bell dings)

41:08.230 --> 41:10.221
What did you say to him?

41:11.670 --> 41:12.898
Does it matter?

41:23.910 --> 41:25.070
(banging)

41:26.810 --> 41:28.641
I'm gonna need some help
taking these back tomorrow.

41:29.850 --> 41:31.545
Fine, but I'm knackered.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.559
So I propose we go one day

41:34.590 --> 41:36.285
without any
early-morning nonsense.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.958
You're making great strides.

41:37.990 --> 41:40.083
Now's the time to dig in.

41:42.660 --> 41:45.959
You weren't entirely wrong
about Watson.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.265
She does have the right
to tell her own stories.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.531
I may have felt some...

41:52.570 --> 41:54.629
mild trepidation
about subjecting myself

41:54.680 --> 41:57.035
to her full appraisal.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.548
Almost imperceptibly mild.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.871
Aanay, um...

42:04.120 --> 42:06.088
I've decided that, uh,

42:06.120 --> 42:09.817
this nondisclosure agreement
was made in error.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.749
I want you
to feel free to, um,

42:12.790 --> 42:15.691
(chuckles)
produce your own memoirs,

42:15.730 --> 42:17.550
should you feel the need.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.591
I'm not much of a writer.

42:19.630 --> 42:21.518
Well, let me know
if that changes.

42:24.300 --> 42:27.599
Who knows?
If you do write a book,

42:27.640 --> 42:29.835
someone might be interested
to read it.

42:42.020 --> 42:43.009
