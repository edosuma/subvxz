WEBVTT

00:34.953 --> 00:37.038
This the wall
she was talking about, Chief?

00:46.631 --> 00:49.217
A trooper found
something in the, uh...

00:49.300 --> 00:52.095
water that's at the quarry.

00:52.178 --> 00:55.431
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

00:55.515 --> 01:00.061
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

01:00.144 --> 01:02.105
accidentally fell in.

01:03.565 --> 01:05.567
The earth must have given way.

01:09.404 --> 01:10.738
Joyce?

01:12.323 --> 01:14.200
Joyce?

01:14.284 --> 01:15.952
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:16.035 --> 01:17.245
No.

01:18.454 --> 01:21.457
Whoever you found...

01:21.541 --> 01:23.042
is not my boy.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.961
-It's not Will.
-Joyce.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.213
No, you don't understand.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.049
I talked to him...

01:30.133 --> 01:31.551
a half hour ago.

01:32.552 --> 01:34.721
He was...
He was here.

01:34.804 --> 01:37.098
He was...
He was talking with these.

01:37.807 --> 01:38.808
-Talking?
-Uh-huh.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.227
One blink for yes, two for no.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.813
And... And, uh...

01:43.896 --> 01:48.776
And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

01:48.860 --> 01:51.195
'Cause he was hiding...

01:51.279 --> 01:53.364
from that... that thing.

01:53.448 --> 01:54.824
The thing that came out of the wall?

01:54.907 --> 01:56.117
-The thing that chased you?
-Yeah.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.411
-Yeah.
-Mom, come on, please.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.538
-You've gotta stop this.
-No, maybe he's...

02:00.622 --> 02:01.914
It's after him!

02:01.998 --> 02:05.460
-He's in danger. We have to find him! We--
-What exactly was this thing?

02:05.543 --> 02:06.919
It was some kind of animal, you said?

02:07.003 --> 02:08.004
Uh, no, it was...

02:08.087 --> 02:11.341
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

02:11.424 --> 02:15.470
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.472
It didn't have a face?

02:18.848 --> 02:20.975
- Joyce.
- It didn't have a face...

02:21.059 --> 02:22.352
Joyce, listen to me.

02:22.435 --> 02:23.895
Listen to me.

02:27.023 --> 02:28.066
After Sarah...

02:29.859 --> 02:32.070
I saw her, too.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.237
And I heard her.

02:35.448 --> 02:38.117
I didn't know what was real.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.370
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.497
And I had to pack all that away.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.792
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

02:45.875 --> 02:47.668
that I couldn't get out of.

02:47.752 --> 02:51.589
No, you're...
you're talking about grief.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.924
This is different.

02:53.883 --> 02:57.470
-I'm just saying that you--
-No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

02:57.553 --> 03:01.766
I swear to you,
I know what I saw.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.102
And I'm not crazy.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.020
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

03:06.104 --> 03:08.022
No...
You are.

03:08.106 --> 03:10.733
And I understand, but...

03:11.651 --> 03:13.236
God, I...

03:13.319 --> 03:15.905
I need you to believe me.

03:16.823 --> 03:19.033
Please.

03:19.117 --> 03:20.993
Please.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.078
Listen...

03:24.622 --> 03:27.458
I think you should go to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.419
It'll give you the answers that you need.

03:29.502 --> 03:30.878
-But tonight...
-Oh, God.

03:30.962 --> 03:33.631
...I want you to try to get some sleep,
if you can.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.003
Byers' body was found
in the water of this quarry

05:36.087 --> 05:38.172
by state police earlier this evening.

05:38.256 --> 05:42.009
It was discovered by state trooper
David O'Bannon, just after dark.

05:42.093 --> 05:44.011
The state police
are mounting an investigation

05:44.095 --> 05:45.972
to determine Byers' cause of death,

05:46.055 --> 05:47.431
but an initial inquiry...

05:47.515 --> 05:50.059
--Should I go down and talk to Michael?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.313
Give him time.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.148
He'll come to us when he's ready.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.668
Can you please stop that?

06:21.090 --> 06:22.425
Are you deaf?

06:23.718 --> 06:25.678
I thought we were friends, you know?

06:25.761 --> 06:27.597
But friends tell each other the truth.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.307
And they definitely don't lie
to each other.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.226
You made me think Will was okay,
that he was still out there,

06:32.310 --> 06:34.270
but he wasn't.
He wasn't!

06:35.229 --> 06:38.357
Maybe you thought you were helping,
but you weren't.

06:38.441 --> 06:41.652
You hurt me.
Do you understand?

06:42.153 --> 06:43.988
What you did sucks.

06:45.865 --> 06:47.742
Lucas was right about you.

06:48.534 --> 06:49.744
All along.

06:57.877 --> 07:01.589
♪ So come on and let me know ♪

07:01.672 --> 07:04.091
♪ Should I stay or should I go? ♪

07:05.509 --> 07:07.970

07:19.482 --> 07:22.026
Will, is that you? It's Mike!
Do you copy?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.235
Over.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.822
- Will, are you there?

07:26.906 --> 07:28.783
- Will!

07:35.206 --> 07:36.749
Was that...

07:36.832 --> 07:37.875
Was it...

07:41.629 --> 07:42.838
Will.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.374
Mom...

09:06.380 --> 09:07.673
Mom!

09:07.757 --> 09:09.175
Mom! Wake up.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.302
What... what time is it?

09:11.385 --> 09:14.055
It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.

09:14.138 --> 09:16.474
Go where? Where?

09:17.308 --> 09:18.726
To see Will.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.814
--Michael?

09:25.232 --> 09:28.027
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?

09:29.153 --> 09:30.696
I, uh...

09:31.739 --> 09:33.657
I don't think I can go to school today.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.451
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.788
I need to drop off Nance,
then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.207
Why don't you grab a book
or something and come with me?

09:41.290 --> 09:43.334
We can stop by the video store
on the way back,

09:43.417 --> 09:45.753
pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.589
I think I just want to stay home today.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.132
I mean, if that's okay?

09:50.216 --> 09:53.511
Well, are you sure you're gonna be
all right here by yourself?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.054
I think so.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.015
Okay.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.434
But if you need anything,
call Dad at work.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.394
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.357
Bye.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.942
Bye, sweetie.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.782
Lucas, do you copy?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.077
Lucas, come on, I know you're there!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.870
This is urgent.
I'm serious.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.292
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

10:25.376 --> 10:26.794
Lucas.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.337
Lucas!

10:28.420 --> 10:30.214
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas...

10:30.297 --> 10:32.591
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas--

10:32.675 --> 10:34.135
Go away, Mike.

10:34.218 --> 10:37.221
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.681
No, not "out."

10:38.764 --> 10:41.225
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.227
-Over.
-What about Will?

10:44.228 --> 10:45.729
You mean about his funeral?
Over.

10:45.855 --> 10:46.981
No, not his funeral.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.566
-Screw his funeral!
-What?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.943
Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.319
Over and out.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.449
What's taking so long?

10:58.367 --> 11:01.620
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic
around here without Gary.

11:02.413 --> 11:03.581
Without Gary?

11:04.582 --> 11:06.750
-Where's Gary?
-Well, I thought you knew.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.212
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.674
So who did the autopsy?

11:14.258 --> 11:15.843
Someone from State.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.830
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

11:44.914 --> 11:46.624
Can you show that to me, please?

11:52.087 --> 11:53.339
How's your mom doing?

11:56.759 --> 11:58.010
I don't know.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.473
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

12:02.556 --> 12:04.767
Will and the thing in the wall?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.730
Since the first phone call, I guess.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.403
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

12:16.487 --> 12:17.696
in the past.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.699
But this...

12:22.159 --> 12:23.410
I don't know.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.209
I'm worried it could be...

12:31.794 --> 12:33.212
Ugh, I don't know.

12:37.675 --> 12:39.093
She'll be okay.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.512
We'll be okay.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.266
My mom...

12:49.144 --> 12:50.980
she's tough.

12:51.105 --> 12:52.564
Yeah, she is.

12:55.109 --> 12:56.485
Hey.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.279
She is.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.492
Ma'am!

13:03.575 --> 13:05.119
-Ma'am, I need you to sign!
-I don't...

13:05.202 --> 13:08.998
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

13:09.081 --> 13:10.833
-Joyce, wait a second.
-No!

13:10.916 --> 13:13.043
- Mom!
- Ma'am, I-- Ma'am!

13:17.464 --> 13:20.342
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

13:20.426 --> 13:21.802
To look for Barb.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.971
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

13:24.054 --> 13:25.681
That's crazy.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

13:28.684 --> 13:31.311
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

13:31.395 --> 13:33.063
just hanging out in my yard?

13:33.147 --> 13:34.898
I don't think it was a mask.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.775
But he had no face?

13:37.943 --> 13:39.778
I don't know!

13:39.862 --> 13:41.739
I don't know, I just...

13:41.822 --> 13:44.408
I have a terrible feeling about this.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.534
Oh, this is bad.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.161
This is really bad.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.287
What?

13:49.204 --> 13:50.247
The cops...

13:51.165 --> 13:53.083
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

13:56.754 --> 13:58.714
-So?
-My parents are gonna murder me!

13:59.715 --> 14:01.759
Are you serious right now?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.927
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.514
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

14:07.598 --> 14:10.934
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

14:11.018 --> 14:12.936
don't mention the beers.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.813
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

14:14.897 --> 14:17.024
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

14:17.107 --> 14:20.069
I can't believe you right now.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.155
-I can't believe you.
-Nancy.

14:24.782 --> 14:26.158
Nancy, wait!

14:27.618 --> 14:29.078
Nancy!

14:30.579 --> 14:32.039
- Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

14:32.122 --> 14:34.541
I need to think.
Just go on home.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.585
Mom, will you just get in, please?

14:39.713 --> 14:40.881
Mom.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.717
Mom!

14:46.136 --> 14:47.179
Mom.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.640
-Stop.
-Just go home, Jonathan.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.476
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.978
-Shut down? What...
-We have to deal with this, Mom.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.772
We have to deal with the funeral!

14:56.855 --> 14:58.315
The funeral?

14:58.399 --> 15:01.318
- For... for who?
- For that thing back there?

15:01.402 --> 15:03.445
Okay, let me get this straight.

15:03.529 --> 15:06.698
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

15:06.782 --> 15:08.617
And there's a monster in the wall?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.202
Do you even hear yourself?

15:11.161 --> 15:13.205
I know it sounds crazy.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.623
I sound crazy!

15:14.706 --> 15:16.500
-Yeah.
-You think I don't know that?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.751
It is crazy!

15:17.835 --> 15:19.670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.422
He talked to me!

15:21.505 --> 15:24.341
Will is... is calling to me!

15:24.425 --> 15:28.303
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

15:28.387 --> 15:30.347
I don't care if anyone believes me!

15:30.431 --> 15:35.018
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.188
I am going to bring him home!

15:38.272 --> 15:41.066
Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

15:41.150 --> 15:43.652
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

15:43.735 --> 15:46.780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

15:50.534 --> 15:52.202
All right, show's over.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.247
What?

16:08.594 --> 16:11.346
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

16:11.430 --> 16:13.849
Yeah, I heard a baby.

16:13.932 --> 16:14.975
What?

16:15.058 --> 16:17.853
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.521
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.398
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

16:21.482 --> 16:22.774
-That was Will!
-Mike...

16:22.858 --> 16:25.068
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.361
Words!

16:26.445 --> 16:29.198
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

16:29.281 --> 16:31.492
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess--

16:31.575 --> 16:32.826
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

16:32.910 --> 16:33.911
I don't think it's about that.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.664
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.417
-Like... like Professor X.
-Yeah.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.169
Are you actually believing this crap?

16:43.086 --> 16:44.129
I don't know, I mean...

16:44.213 --> 16:47.049
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

16:47.132 --> 16:49.343
He sounded a lot like that.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.471
Did you guys not see what I saw?

16:52.554 --> 16:54.806
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.433
He's dead!

16:58.769 --> 17:01.230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.981
-It's not his ghost.
-So how do you know that?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.733
-I just do!
-Then what was in that water?

17:04.816 --> 17:05.901
I don't know!

17:05.984 --> 17:08.195
All I know is Will is alive.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.738
Will is alive!

17:09.821 --> 17:11.156
He's out there somewhere.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.866
All we have to do is find him.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.999
This isn't gonna work.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.046
-Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
-Yeah.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.172
The Heathkit's at school.

17:27.256 --> 17:31.510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.471
I mean... look at her.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.559
Wow.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.686
-She looks--
-Pretty.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.106
Good.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.482
You look pretty good.

18:43.749 --> 18:45.000
Pretty.

18:46.752 --> 18:47.961
Good.

19:32.506 --> 19:33.840
Clear.

19:37.511 --> 19:40.472
-You boys hear me all right in there?
-Loud and clear, Shepard.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.266
Good luck in there, son.

20:43.702 --> 20:47.330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

20:47.414 --> 20:49.416
bearing us down towards the sea

20:49.499 --> 20:52.252
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.006
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too--"

20:56.631 --> 20:58.550
Nancy Wheeler?

20:58.633 --> 21:00.510
If you'll come with me, please?

21:05.140 --> 21:08.935
This argument
you and Barbara had?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.645
What exactly was it about?

21:12.522 --> 21:14.858
It wasn't really an argument.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.819
Barb just wanted to leave.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.030
I didn't, so, I...

21:21.823 --> 21:23.658
I told her to just go home.

21:24.659 --> 21:25.869
Then what?

21:26.995 --> 21:30.665
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

21:30.749 --> 21:33.627
And the next day, you went back and...

21:33.710 --> 21:35.128
saw a bear, you're thinking?

21:36.421 --> 21:39.841
I don't know what it was, but...

21:39.925 --> 21:41.134
I think...

21:42.260 --> 21:45.222
I think maybe it took Barb.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.599
-You need to check behind Steve's house--
-We did.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.017
There's nothing there.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.770
-There's no sign of a bear.
-And no car.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.021
- What?
- Look.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.357
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

21:55.440 --> 21:57.567
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

21:59.903 --> 22:01.363
Leaving town, maybe?

22:01.446 --> 22:02.572
No.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.866
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

22:04.950 --> 22:08.328
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

22:08.411 --> 22:10.622
Uh, Steve Harrington?

22:10.705 --> 22:12.332
What? No!

22:12.415 --> 22:15.585
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

22:15.669 --> 22:16.753
It wasn't like that.

22:16.837 --> 22:17.963
Like what?

22:18.046 --> 22:20.924
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.759
We... we just talked.

22:22.843 --> 22:26.888
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

22:31.434 --> 22:33.853
So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.147
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.482
They're all Staties?

22:37.566 --> 22:38.567
Yes, sir.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.695
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.573
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

22:44.656 --> 22:46.575
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.661
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

22:49.744 --> 22:51.580
Considering what?

22:51.663 --> 22:54.791
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.427
-Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
-Sure thing.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.054
...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty

23:08.138 --> 23:11.683
and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.269
State trooper David O'Bannon,
thank you so much for your help.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.937
- Thank you, sir.
- Back to you...

23:37.250 --> 23:39.836
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.588
Attention students,

23:41.671 --> 23:46.343
there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.261
Do not go to fourth period.

23:48.345 --> 23:49.512
It's locked.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.765
-What?
-Hey, do you think you can open it?

23:51.848 --> 23:53.558
With your powers?

23:53.642 --> 23:55.101
Boys?

23:55.185 --> 23:56.186
Hey.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.771
Assembly's about to start.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.607
We know.
We're just, you know...

24:00.690 --> 24:02.484
Upset.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.860
Yeah, definitely upset.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.403
We need some alone time.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.656
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen...

24:07.739 --> 24:08.990
I get it. I do.

24:09.074 --> 24:12.077
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

24:12.577 --> 24:13.578
And then...

24:16.122 --> 24:18.583
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.085
What do you say?

24:20.168 --> 24:22.671
I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

24:24.714 --> 24:26.424
-Eleven--
-Eleanor! She's my, uh--

24:26.508 --> 24:27.592
-Cousin.
-Second cousin.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.886
She's here for Will's funeral.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.222
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.349
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

24:34.432 --> 24:35.475
Thank you.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.144
Uh, where are you from exactly?

24:39.437 --> 24:40.605
Bad place--

24:40.689 --> 24:42.399
-Sweden!
-I have a lot of Swedish family.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.900
- She hates it there.
- Cold!

24:43.983 --> 24:46.569
Subzero.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.114
-Shall we?
-Yep!

24:50.448 --> 24:51.908
At times like these...

24:51.991 --> 24:55.829
it is important that we come together
as a community.

24:55.912 --> 24:58.123
- We come--

25:01.209 --> 25:02.627
Abort.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.215
We come together to heal...

25:08.425 --> 25:09.843
we come together to grieve...

25:11.344 --> 25:13.888
-You lied to the police!
-I didn't lie!

25:13.972 --> 25:16.224
How naive do you think I am?

25:16.307 --> 25:18.435
You and Steve were just talking?

25:18.518 --> 25:19.769
We slept together!

25:19.853 --> 25:22.105
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

25:22.188 --> 25:25.525
-It does matter!
-No! It is all bullshit!

25:25.608 --> 25:27.819
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.779
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.781
I know it!

25:31.865 --> 25:33.908
And no one is listening to me!

25:33.992 --> 25:35.535
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.329
-I'm listening to you--
-No! You're not!

25:38.413 --> 25:40.415
Nancy... Nancy!

25:40.498 --> 25:42.208
Just leave me alone!

27:18.346 --> 27:19.848
Try him again.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.559
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

27:24.227 --> 27:27.230
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.651
This is Shepard.
Confirming, over.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.529
Shepard.
Where are you?

27:34.612 --> 27:38.032
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.493
I...
I can't make out my location.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.287
It's hard to see.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.084
Shepard? Do you copy?

27:50.086 --> 27:52.338
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

27:52.422 --> 27:55.049
There's something else...
There's something else in here!

27:56.676 --> 27:58.928
--Reel him in.

27:59.012 --> 28:02.056
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.516
Come on, come on!
Faster!

28:03.600 --> 28:05.101
There's something else in here!

28:05.184 --> 28:07.228
Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!

28:07.312 --> 28:09.522
- Pull me out! Pull me out!

28:30.168 --> 28:33.087
- Shepard, come in. Over.
- Comms are down, sir.

28:33.171 --> 28:34.756
Shepard, come in!
Over.

29:05.161 --> 29:08.122
Will Byers' death
is an unimaginable tragedy.

29:08.957 --> 29:13.670
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

29:13.753 --> 29:19.259
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

29:20.301 --> 29:22.637
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.390
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.101
But before she comes up here,

29:28.184 --> 29:32.355
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

29:32.438 --> 29:33.606
Look at these fakers.

29:34.524 --> 29:36.442
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

29:36.526 --> 29:38.152
--What?

29:38.236 --> 29:40.947
Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.491
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

29:43.574 --> 29:45.743
Oh,
he was such a great student.

29:45.827 --> 29:50.123
Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.791
Mouth breather.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.976
Hey! Hey!

30:10.059 --> 30:11.311
Hey, Troy!

30:11.394 --> 30:12.562
Hey, Troy!

30:14.772 --> 30:16.607
You... you think this is funny?

30:16.691 --> 30:18.109
What'd you say, Wheeler?

30:18.192 --> 30:20.737
I saw you guys
laughing over there.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.947
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.074
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

30:25.158 --> 30:26.784
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.872
Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

30:30.955 --> 30:32.915
Will's in fairyland now, right?

30:32.999 --> 30:35.960
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.545
All happy and gay!

30:51.434 --> 30:53.144
You're dead, Wheeler!

30:53.853 --> 30:54.937
Dead!

31:05.114 --> 31:07.658
Dude, Troy peed himself.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.502
Holy shit!

31:22.465 --> 31:24.092
Hey! What's going on here?

31:24.175 --> 31:25.259
Oh.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.428
Mike! Let's go!

31:35.478 --> 31:39.482
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

31:40.483 --> 31:43.986
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

31:44.070 --> 31:47.740
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

31:54.455 --> 31:56.457
Can you just give me a second?

31:56.541 --> 31:57.583
Of course.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.631
Hey.

32:04.382 --> 32:05.425
Hey.

32:06.717 --> 32:09.971
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

32:12.515 --> 32:13.599
I just...

32:16.185 --> 32:18.146
Can we talk for a second?

32:20.314 --> 32:23.401
It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

32:23.484 --> 32:25.528
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.156
I don't know.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.449
It's weird.

32:32.493 --> 32:35.163
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

32:35.246 --> 32:37.039
No.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.584
And she was there one second
and then, um...

32:40.668 --> 32:42.211
gone.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.921
I figured she bolted.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.340
The cops think that she ran away.

32:48.718 --> 32:50.344
But they don't know Barb.

32:50.428 --> 32:53.014
And I went back to Steve's...

32:54.223 --> 32:56.767
and I thought I...

32:56.851 --> 32:58.644
saw something.

32:58.728 --> 33:00.021
Some...

33:01.564 --> 33:03.274
weird man or...

33:04.650 --> 33:06.777
I don't know what it was.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.159
I'm sorry.

33:13.242 --> 33:17.163
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

33:17.872 --> 33:19.081
I'm so sorry.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.541
What'd he look like?

33:23.211 --> 33:24.253
What?

33:24.337 --> 33:26.589
This man you saw in the woods.

33:27.381 --> 33:28.633
What'd he look like?

33:29.634 --> 33:32.637
I don't know.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.433
It was almost like he...

33:37.517 --> 33:38.559
he didn't have--

33:38.643 --> 33:40.478
Didn't have a face?

33:42.480 --> 33:44.565
How did you know that?

33:58.913 --> 34:00.248
Aw, come on!

34:02.083 --> 34:03.668
Another, please.

34:03.751 --> 34:05.711
And another for my, uh, friend here.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.756
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.425
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

34:11.509 --> 34:14.387
My daughter,
she won the spelling bee today.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.722
Is that right?

34:16.806 --> 34:18.307
Yeah, that's right.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.686
"Odontalgia."

34:22.603 --> 34:23.646
That was the word.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.565
You know what it means?

34:25.648 --> 34:28.109
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

34:30.528 --> 34:34.073
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

34:34.156 --> 34:36.450
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.245
Your daughter, she got a name?

34:43.082 --> 34:44.125
What?

34:44.208 --> 34:46.752
Your daughter?
What's her name?

34:48.421 --> 34:49.505
Sarah.

34:50.881 --> 34:52.008
Her name's Sarah.

34:54.468 --> 34:55.511
To Sarah.

35:05.813 --> 35:07.690
I recognize you.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.025
Are you famous or somethin'?

35:09.942 --> 35:13.404
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

35:15.865 --> 35:17.575
So, you on that case or what?

35:17.658 --> 35:19.327
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

35:19.410 --> 35:20.536
Dumb luck.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.415
So that quarry, that's, uh...

35:24.498 --> 35:26.917
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.337
Yeah.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.718
Yeah, well, that's funny.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.055
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

35:39.138 --> 35:42.975
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.435
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.562
That's right.

35:48.356 --> 35:49.815
So why are you lying to me, man?

35:53.027 --> 35:54.236
What's your problem, bud?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.946
I don't have a problem.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.491
I'm just a concerned citizen.

35:58.574 --> 35:59.742
Yeah?

35:59.825 --> 36:02.495
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

36:02.578 --> 36:03.871
The kid is dead.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.122
End of story.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.086
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

36:18.552 --> 36:19.637
Okay...

36:19.720 --> 36:21.681
- Let's try this one more time.

36:21.764 --> 36:23.766
Who told you to be out there?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.601
What were you doing out there?

36:26.686 --> 36:29.105
I don't know!
I don't know. They...

36:29.230 --> 36:33.442
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

36:33.526 --> 36:35.152
Get close to what?

36:35.236 --> 36:36.487
The body.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.156
Who do you work for?

36:39.240 --> 36:41.701
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

36:42.660 --> 36:44.620
- Who is that?

36:44.704 --> 36:46.580
-You're gonna get us both killed.
-Who is that?

36:46.664 --> 36:49.083
Hey! Hey!

37:08.018 --> 37:10.688
Come on!
Come on!

37:12.815 --> 37:14.525
Talk to me!

37:14.608 --> 37:16.902
I know you're here!

37:20.614 --> 37:21.782
Come on.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.789
-Now what?
-She'll find him.

37:28.873 --> 37:29.999
Right, El?

37:41.802 --> 37:43.137
Eleven?

37:45.222 --> 37:46.766
Are you listening?

37:49.560 --> 37:51.645
That man before you...

37:55.483 --> 37:57.401
I need you to find him.

38:02.656 --> 38:05.159
- Hurt him?
- No.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.828
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.457
I want you to listen to him.

38:15.211 --> 38:16.837
-Listen?
-Yes.

38:17.838 --> 38:22.343
I want you to listen to what he says
and repeat his words back to me.

38:23.677 --> 38:26.931
Just like we used to
with those old nursery rhymes.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.432
Do you remember?

38:29.683 --> 38:31.185
Hmm?

38:31.310 --> 38:33.395
Do you think you can do that for me?

38:35.356 --> 38:37.149
-Mmm-hmm.
-Good.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.085
Begin.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.003
Amulet.

38:58.921 --> 38:59.922
Frigid.

39:00.756 --> 39:01.882
Evolve.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.051
Airplane.

39:05.052 --> 39:06.303
Eleven?

39:07.429 --> 39:09.056
Repeat the words.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.813
Apricot.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.982
Peninsula.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.817
Game.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.360
Enchantment.

39:22.278 --> 39:23.445
Mouse.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.781
Balloon.

39:26.490 --> 39:27.616
She's doing it.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.410
-She's finding him!
-This is crazy.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.287
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.

39:32.580 --> 39:34.707
- Holy...

39:42.590 --> 39:43.841
What is that?

40:01.734 --> 40:02.776
Mom?

40:02.860 --> 40:04.778
Will?

40:04.862 --> 40:06.280
Mom?

40:07.364 --> 40:08.657
No way!

40:09.325 --> 40:10.534
- Mom...
- Will!

40:10.618 --> 40:11.660
Please...

40:11.744 --> 40:13.078
Will!

40:13.913 --> 40:15.080
Will!

40:17.166 --> 40:18.208
Will...

40:19.627 --> 40:20.669
Will!

40:20.753 --> 40:22.087
- Mom!
- Will!

40:22.171 --> 40:24.590
I'm here! I'm here!

40:24.673 --> 40:25.883
- Oh, God...
- Mom!

40:25.966 --> 40:27.927
-Will!
-Will, it's us! Are you there?

40:28.010 --> 40:29.386
Can you hear us?
We're here!

40:29.470 --> 40:31.472
Hello? Mom?

40:31.555 --> 40:32.598
Why can't he hear us?

40:32.681 --> 40:33.891
I don't know!

40:35.601 --> 40:36.769
Baby...

40:36.852 --> 40:39.647
-Mom?
-Oh, God. Will!

40:39.730 --> 40:40.731
Mom!

40:41.357 --> 40:42.775
Oh, thank God.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.652
Baby...

40:44.735 --> 40:45.778
Will...

40:45.861 --> 40:47.988
--Mom...

40:48.072 --> 40:49.406
Mom, it's coming!

40:49.490 --> 40:51.700
Tell me where you are!
How do I get to you?

40:51.784 --> 40:54.286
It's like home,
but it's so dark...

40:54.370 --> 40:58.248
It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold!

40:58.332 --> 40:59.541
Mom? Mom!

40:59.625 --> 41:02.920
Listen to me!
I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?

41:03.003 --> 41:04.838
But right now, I need you to hide.

41:04.922 --> 41:06.298
Mom, please!

41:06.382 --> 41:08.968
- No, no, listen! Listen, I...

41:09.051 --> 41:12.012
I will find you, but you have to run now!

41:12.096 --> 41:14.431
- Run! Run!

41:40.374 --> 41:41.583
- El, are you okay?
- Oh!

41:43.627 --> 41:44.712
Can you move?

41:47.881 --> 41:49.133
Here, help her up.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.294
--This way!

42:31.842 --> 42:33.260
And you're...

42:33.343 --> 42:35.679
Brightening.
Enlarging.

42:35.763 --> 42:36.889
Hmm.

42:39.767 --> 42:42.019
- Did your mom say anything else?

42:42.102 --> 42:46.148
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

42:46.231 --> 42:49.651
- No, just that it came out of the wall.

42:56.825 --> 42:58.035
How long does this take?

42:58.994 --> 43:00.204
Not long.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.084
Have you been...

43:05.167 --> 43:07.002
doing this a while?

43:07.086 --> 43:08.670
What?

43:08.754 --> 43:10.005
Photography?

43:11.673 --> 43:12.716
Yeah.

43:13.634 --> 43:17.805
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

43:18.722 --> 43:19.932
Talk to them.

43:20.015 --> 43:21.975
I know.
It's weird.

43:22.059 --> 43:23.060
No!

43:23.185 --> 43:25.270
No, it is.

43:25.354 --> 43:26.855
It's just, sometimes...

43:27.856 --> 43:30.567
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

43:31.485 --> 43:33.403
But you capture the right moment...

43:34.321 --> 43:35.656
it says more.

43:35.739 --> 43:37.116
What was I saying?

43:38.033 --> 43:39.743
What?

43:39.827 --> 43:41.120
When you took my picture.

43:42.871 --> 43:44.456
I shouldn't have taken that.

43:46.542 --> 43:47.668
I'm, uh...

43:47.751 --> 43:49.294
I'm sorry.

43:51.213 --> 43:52.673
It's just--

43:52.756 --> 43:54.299
That's it.

43:55.717 --> 43:57.344
That's what I saw.

44:00.222 --> 44:01.807
My mom...

44:01.890 --> 44:03.851
I thought she was crazy

44:03.934 --> 44:05.686
'cause she said...

44:05.769 --> 44:08.522
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

44:08.605 --> 44:11.275
-And if he's alive--
-Then Barbara.

44:30.335 --> 44:32.337
-Hey, Patty!
-Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

44:32.421 --> 44:34.923
-Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
-Oh.

44:35.007 --> 44:36.717
I'll just be a minute.

44:41.013 --> 44:44.892
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

44:44.975 --> 44:46.018
Hey, you can't be back here.

44:46.101 --> 44:47.686
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

44:47.769 --> 44:49.730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.899
-It's some emergency...
-What the hell are you talking about?

44:51.982 --> 44:53.108
I don't work with O'Bannon.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.985
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

44:57.279 --> 44:58.989
Okay.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.799
Babe...

47:22.883 --> 47:24.217
Jesus, the hell happened?

47:26.762 --> 47:27.929
Lonnie.
