00:01.523 --> 00:03.046
[Supergirl]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.570
[Winn] We got rid of two out of the three Worldkillers.

00:06.963 --> 00:10.532
[Dark Kryptonian]
Ruby Arias must die.

00:10.575 --> 00:11.620
Hi, Patricia.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.100
You were my mother.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.579
And I always wanted
what was best for you.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.625
So you just let me leave?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.801
There's too much at stake
for you to still be mad at me.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
I said we would work together.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.457
Never said it would be
sunshine and rainbows.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.849
I'm Guardian.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.503
I broke into your lab
for Supergirl.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.375
I trust you.

00:27.418 --> 00:28.898
That wasn't Lex's Kryptonite.
I figured out how to make it.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.824
[James exhales]

00:46.350 --> 00:47.569
Wow.

00:49.266 --> 00:52.095
And I thought I had
a nice view from my office.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.618
It's nice waking up with you.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.713
Ever think about getting
your own place?

01:01.757 --> 01:05.326
I mean, you're kinda slumming
it here at the moment.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.675
When I first moved
to National City,

01:06.718 --> 01:08.329
I didn't know
if I was gonna stay.

01:08.372 --> 01:11.419
Lex was in prison,
the company was in shambles.

01:11.462 --> 01:15.640
I didn't know if I was gonna
put down roots, settle down,

01:17.077 --> 01:18.861
in case the city rejected me.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.384
Well, it's been two years.

01:22.256 --> 01:25.041
I think it's safe to say
that you can sign
your own lease.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.783
Even with Supergirl
thinking the worst of me?

01:27.826 --> 01:29.350
-What does she know?
-[chuckles]

01:30.568 --> 01:32.179
Asking you to spy on me?

01:32.222 --> 01:34.355
-What do I know?
-[both chuckle]

01:36.531 --> 01:39.099
I'm really glad I can tell you
my secrets now.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.104
Of course, you can. Me, too.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.411
[Lena grunts]

01:49.805 --> 01:51.415
Where is the child?

01:51.459 --> 01:53.200
Where's Ruby Arias?

01:53.939 --> 01:56.072
[James grunting]

01:56.116 --> 01:57.378
Where is she--

01:58.335 --> 01:59.380
You'll never find her.

01:59.423 --> 02:00.424
[groans]

02:01.512 --> 02:03.514
[theme music playing]

02:07.997 --> 02:09.781
[J'onn J'onzz]
I went to the market
yesterday, Father.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.827
I bought some of those
cocoa beans.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.568
I thought we could mix them up

02:13.611 --> 02:15.744
with some of those
Sidamo Guji beans
you like so much.

02:15.787 --> 02:18.616
On this planet,
they call the mixing
of the two brown waters...

02:19.530 --> 02:20.923
a mocha.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.447
Please leave me be, Rokar.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.537
It's, uh...

02:27.973 --> 02:31.325
It's not Rokar,
it's J'onn, Father.

02:31.368 --> 02:34.502
But I still have a little time
before seeing the Legion off.

02:36.243 --> 02:40.508
But perhaps I could help you
with the Ta'ar Ka'riq,

02:40.551 --> 02:42.510
continue the preservation
of your memories.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.948
I haven't the energy today.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.036
I think it would be good
for you.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.646
I have not the energy.

02:53.390 --> 02:58.003
Maybe if you could turn on
the vinyl discs,

02:59.396 --> 03:00.658
that would be nice.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.008
Sure.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.184
Of course.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.840
[jazz music playing on record]

03:11.060 --> 03:13.280
[Imra] Chameleon was
the first Legionnaire to fall.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.020
Stricken by the blade.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.979
Six more quickly followed.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.242
So you put them in stasis
to save their lives.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.332
It was Brainy's idea.
Keep them on ice
until we can find a cure.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.553
I was wondering why
you hadn't woken them up
to join the fight.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.859
We couldn't risk exposing
your timeline to the sickness.

03:27.903 --> 03:31.559
Couldn't risk causing
the very thing we were trying
so hard to prevent.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.082
But we did prevent it.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.475
And with Pestilence defeated
in this time,

03:34.518 --> 03:36.041
they were never infected.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.652
So their vitals are back
to normal.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.915
It is imperative that Imra
return to the future.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.091
We don't know that
the Titan Alliance
will have held

03:42.134 --> 03:44.224
given the change
to the timeline.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.749
Every second we waste
could bring us
closer to intergalactic war.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.143
Well, with the Legion's help,
we defeated two Worldkillers.

03:51.187 --> 03:54.190
I think we can handle Reign
from here on out.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.192
Especially with my new
cape tricks.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
[chuckles]

03:58.281 --> 04:00.065
Well, I guess
it's back to the future then.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.289
Which I do know
is a movie title.
I just like saying it.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.292
Mmm. Yes, honestly,
what time traveler doesn't?

04:09.336 --> 04:12.817
"Back... to the future."

04:15.429 --> 04:17.039
[Brainy]
When I first got here,

04:17.082 --> 04:19.781
I assessed you
as a first-level intellect.

04:19.824 --> 04:20.912
Thank you.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.305
As reference, I'm a 12th.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.872
Oh, yes.
Yes, you've mentioned that.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.874
But now that I've gotten
to know you,

04:25.917 --> 04:29.747
I realize that
you're actually
more accurately categorized

04:29.791 --> 04:33.751
as a 1.42-level intellect.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.753
Wow. Thank you.

04:35.797 --> 04:39.888
Mmm. It is I
who's expressing gratitude
for all of your help

04:39.931 --> 04:41.890
with this gift.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.895
What's this, space dirt?

04:46.938 --> 04:48.679
Earth dirt.

04:48.723 --> 04:52.422
But it is
from the 31st century.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.643
Are you serious?
[stammering]
This is future dirt?

04:55.686 --> 04:57.601
Yes.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.342
How did you...
Did Mon-El tell you
about my dirt collection?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.823
No, I ran a diagnostic
of your personality,

05:01.866 --> 05:07.176
and calculated
with a 98.7% certainty
that you either collected dirt

05:07.219 --> 05:09.265
or New York Mets
baseball cards.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.963
And judging by
the last 783 uninterrupted
Major League seasons,

05:12.007 --> 05:14.531
I figured dirt was more likely
to hold its value.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.449
Shall we embrace?

05:20.885 --> 05:22.147
What are you doing?
That's... Oh!

05:23.540 --> 05:24.889
We're gonna bro-hug.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.065
So, this way,
and then you wanna...

05:27.109 --> 05:29.067
-Yeah.
-I'll go... Uh...

05:29.111 --> 05:31.331
You... Yeah,
that's good. Yeah.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.333
Uh...

05:33.376 --> 05:35.117
[Imra] The worst moment
of my life

05:35.160 --> 05:37.032
was watching my sister die.

05:38.686 --> 05:42.211
But now, because of your help,

05:42.254 --> 05:44.344
I have faith that
I'll see her again.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.520
[Winn] Hey, Alex.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.043
You gotta see
what Brainy just got me.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.437
Space dirt ain't got nothing
on this baby.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.613
Oh... The nerd-fest beckons.

05:52.656 --> 05:53.701
[laughter]

05:55.137 --> 05:56.747
[Supergirl]
Mon-El's changed a lot.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.228
He's become a great man.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.665
And I'm certain you have a lot
to do with that.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.450
Thanks, Kara.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.409
Hey, [sighs] I think it's time
to buckle in.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.499
I'll, uh... I'll help Brainy
with the preparations.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.068
Well, you would think
that we would be experts

06:13.111 --> 06:14.417
at goodbyes now.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.462
[both chuckle]

06:18.378 --> 06:22.686
It's no secret
that I struggled
when you got here.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.558
Yeah, you weren't
the only one.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.387
But I can honestly say now,
truthfully...

06:29.606 --> 06:31.739
I'm really happy
I got to see you again.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.483
Witnessed the man
you've become.

06:40.051 --> 06:44.055
It meant the world to me
to be back here with you.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.450
And with everyone.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.191
To fight by your side.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.888
I'm really gonna miss
your friendship.

06:53.978 --> 06:57.199
Kara, there's been an attack
at Lena's penthouse.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.287
[exhales]

06:58.330 --> 06:59.419
Go.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.380
[Winn] Man, J'onn's gonna
be sad he missed you.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.079
Yeah, tell him it's okay.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.559
I'll see him
in a thousand years.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.127
[Winn chuckles]

07:12.170 --> 07:13.345
Okay.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.487
Why would Reign go after Lena?

07:24.531 --> 07:27.055
Well, Lena did imprison Reign
and then, you know,

07:27.098 --> 07:29.449
experimented on her
for a little bit.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.494
But revenge isn't Reign's MO.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.583
-I agree.
-[Lena] You're right.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.498
Reign wasn't looking for me.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.587
She was looking for Ruby.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.676
-Is she...
-Reign won't find her.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.286
Ruby's safe, I promise.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.549
And are you okay?

07:43.419 --> 07:45.029
Fine.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.467
So, Reign is after Ruby
and she started with Lena.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.557
Where else might she look?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.863
Sam's mother, Patricia,
she's got a farm
outside the city.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.430
Supergirl and I will go
get Patricia to safety

07:54.474 --> 07:55.997
and then wait
for Reign to attack.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.260
Anything you've discovered
while studying Reign

07:58.303 --> 08:00.480
that you think we should add
to our arsenal?

08:00.523 --> 08:01.872
Electricity.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.874
It was how I was able
to wake Reign up

08:03.918 --> 08:05.223
and force her back down.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.704
Ooh, I can retrofit something.

08:07.748 --> 08:10.098
-Alex?
-I need to get to Ruby.

08:10.141 --> 08:13.101
I told you,
she's in a safe place.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.581
And the less people
that know about that,

08:14.624 --> 08:16.147
the safer the place will be.

08:16.191 --> 08:20.238
I understand that,
but she's probably afraid.

08:20.282 --> 08:23.590
Lena, please let me just
get to her, just in case.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.461
Where Ruby is,
Reign will never find her.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.032
It's not on any maps.
You can't see it from space.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.774
Nobody knows about it,
except for me and my brother.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.384
[beeping]

08:35.427 --> 08:36.907
[Supergirl] And how does Lex
know about it?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.953
[Lena]
Because it's his mansion.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.578
[knocking on door]

08:55.622 --> 08:58.407
Patricia Arias,
we need to talk to you.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.279
Let's go.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.109
Mrs. Arias?

09:05.153 --> 09:07.068
Francis Pierce, I told you

09:07.111 --> 09:11.159
that the next time
I caught you in my house
looking for pills,

09:11.202 --> 09:14.075
I was gonna put a hole
through your thieving hand.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.119
[gun cocks]

09:18.296 --> 09:19.297
Supergirl.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.563
We're sorry if we
startled you, Mrs. Arias.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.914
This is J'onn J'onzz
from the FBI.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.438
We have reason to believe
that Reign is on her way here.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.658
Which means this house
isn't safe.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.963
We need to get you out of it.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.228
She's her, isn't she?

09:39.970 --> 09:41.842
My Sam is Reign.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.235
How do you know?

09:49.632 --> 09:52.722
I, uh... I never told her
where she was from.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.637
I... [clicks tongue]

09:54.681 --> 09:58.380
I just wanted her
to be normal,
and then when she was ten,

09:58.423 --> 10:00.861
she started doodling
all over her books.

10:00.904 --> 10:04.560
It was like something
inside her
just needed to get out...

10:04.604 --> 10:06.083
and I punished her for it.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.610
I grounded her,
and I tore up the pages.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.580
[exhales]

10:26.190 --> 10:28.671
So she drew it
on the wall to spite me.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.543
When I saw the same mark
all over the news, I knew.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.200
[sighing] Oh, Jesus.

10:36.244 --> 10:39.769
All I ever wanted to do
was to protect her.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.249
That's all I ever wanted.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.036
When we bury things...

10:48.822 --> 10:50.780
And I should've known this,
but...

10:51.868 --> 10:53.783
When we bury things,

10:53.827 --> 10:58.005
they come at you even harder.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.138
What Sam's become
has nothing to do with
the way she was raised.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.662
I was an awful mother.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.316
I kicked her out.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.667
[inhales sharply]

11:07.710 --> 11:09.669
I've never even met
my granddaughter.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.368
Uh...

11:13.411 --> 11:15.936
We need to... [clears throat]
get you out of here
before she comes.

11:15.979 --> 11:20.941
No, if she's coming here,
I wanna be here when she does.

11:20.984 --> 11:24.509
I kicked her out
when I should've helped her.

11:26.381 --> 11:29.036
I am not gonna turn away
from her now.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.566
[Mrs. Queller exhales heavily]

11:37.609 --> 11:39.786
Not much further,
Agent Danvers.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.352
I'm fine, Mrs. Queller.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.441
Oh. Of course, you are.
[chuckles]

11:43.485 --> 11:45.748
I mean, you're in much better
shape than me.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.185
You don't have these knees
I have to contend with.

11:48.229 --> 11:51.754
Do you know, it took me a week
to get used to the distances
in this place.

11:51.798 --> 11:55.802
The step count
from wing to wing, 5,000.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.629
Slightly bigger
than my townhouse.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.588
Well, I'm in a studio, so...

11:59.631 --> 12:01.677
And the creepy decor.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
Oh, this one.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.681
Worse than the Mona Lisa.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.639
Her eyes follow
you everywhere.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.641
Not in a good way.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.643
But, you know,
if you can overlook
some of the furnishings

12:11.687 --> 12:13.471
and the fact that the owner
was a serial killer.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.343
Luckily, we haven't found
a body yet.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.738
And the amenities
are really quite fantastic.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.091
Ruby doll, look who's come
to pay you a visit.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.179
Aunt Alex.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.571
Hi.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.225
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

12:28.269 --> 12:29.270
Is my mom with you?

12:30.271 --> 12:32.882
No. She's still sick.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.318
What's wrong with her?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.407
She won't tell me,
and Lena won't tell me.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.582
Do you know?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.542
No, I don't.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.500
I haven't heard
from her in days,

12:42.544 --> 12:44.938
and on the news,
there are stories
about the Pestilence outbreak.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.114
Is that what this is?
Was my mom infected?

12:47.157 --> 12:48.855
No, Ruby. No.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.988
I'm 12 years old, Alex.
I can handle anything.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.598
Just tell me what it is.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.339
I would if I knew.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.211
But I don't.

12:59.213 --> 13:02.738
Now, why don't you take me
on a tour of this mausoleum?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.436
I heard there is
an indoor pool?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.354
[J'onn J'onzz]
Everything is set.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.748
Patricia's in the safe room.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.620
She said we can grab anything
out of the fridge if we want.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.928
She said there's pudding.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.191
-No thanks.
-[both chuckle]

13:25.543 --> 13:27.719
Mon-El and everyone
missed you this morning.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.983
Uh, yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

13:30.026 --> 13:34.117
I was, um,
dealing with my father.

13:34.161 --> 13:38.600
Since the incident at the DEO,
he has become
increasingly depressed.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.211
Irritable, if I push him.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.171
Can Alex prescribe something?

13:45.781 --> 13:51.700
I'm giving him
Martian medicine, which helps.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.094
But the reality is,
with the psychic dampener on,

13:54.137 --> 13:55.486
there isn't really much
he can do.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.318
Yeah, I know I needed
to protect him,

14:02.711 --> 14:03.973
protect all of us, but...

14:06.149 --> 14:10.545
I still wish there was
some way I could make him
feel useful.

14:13.026 --> 14:18.118
There are moments
when he doesn't seem
to remember who I am.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.989
Thinks I'm someone
from his past.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.601
I'm sorry, J'onn.

14:23.645 --> 14:27.301
It's funny how
his past memories
are so clear to him,

14:27.344 --> 14:30.260
yet his present thoughts
are so chaotic.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.308
Hey.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.571
[faint rustling]

14:43.534 --> 14:44.709
Pestilence.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.363
How?

15:01.639 --> 15:02.945
Patricia.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.818
[thunder rumbling]

15:09.560 --> 15:10.866
Are you home?

15:29.885 --> 15:31.147
[glass cracks]

15:42.071 --> 15:43.333
Ruby?

15:45.205 --> 15:47.511
Sweetheart, it's Mommy.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.559
I know you're scared.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.346
But I've come back for you.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.611
Did you miss me?

16:04.702 --> 16:05.703
So much.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.677
[shrieking]

16:24.679 --> 16:25.723
[groaning]

16:35.081 --> 16:36.691
[groaning]

16:40.825 --> 16:42.566
[Patricia] Sam!

16:42.610 --> 16:44.177
[breathing heavily]

16:44.220 --> 16:46.048
[Patricia]
Sam, I know you're in there.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.268
I know my daughter's in there.

16:48.311 --> 16:52.794
And I need her to understand,
you are not this monster.

16:52.837 --> 16:56.580
You are kind and good.
You are everything
that I wasn't.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.930
You're not this.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.324
Honey, if you're listening,
if you can hear me,

17:01.368 --> 17:03.805
I need you to rise up!

17:03.848 --> 17:06.068
Not for me. Not for me, Sam.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.809
This is for Ruby.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.071
For your daughter.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.598
What did you do
for your daughter?

17:14.642 --> 17:16.339
-[flesh squelches]
-[groans]

17:17.427 --> 17:18.602
No!

17:21.083 --> 17:22.780
I love you, Sam.

17:23.564 --> 17:24.782
I forgive you.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.091
[yells]

17:29.874 --> 17:30.962
[grunting]

17:35.750 --> 17:37.404
She's dying.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.449
[J'onn J'onzz] Reign's has
all the Worldkiller's powers.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.235
Let's get her out of here.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.584
We gotta go.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.020
[sighing]

17:53.942 --> 17:55.552
[Brainy] Oh, yes.

17:56.553 --> 17:59.121
This view is beautiful.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.949
How long till we reach
the disruption?

18:00.992 --> 18:03.473
Five hours,
22 minutes, 16 seconds.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.131
Oh.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.133
That's a shame.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.179
What's a shame?

18:13.222 --> 18:16.486
I was calculating the odds
of Supergirl and DEO
defeating Reign

18:16.530 --> 18:18.358
now that her power
has tripled.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.751
Tripled?

18:20.795 --> 18:23.276
It appears she's absorbed
the powers
of Pestilence and Purity.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.799
Wait, how do you know this?

18:24.842 --> 18:27.323
I bugged the DEO...

18:28.672 --> 18:30.283
In the dirt I gave Winn.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.807
And he thinks
he's a 1.42-level intellect.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.678
Why would you bug them?

18:34.722 --> 18:37.638
I grew quite fond of Supergirl
and her compatriots.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.118
I wanted to keep tabs.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.641
Tell me the odds.

18:40.684 --> 18:44.166
On their own, they have
a 51% chance of success.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.473
But ironically, if only
one Legionnaire
had stayed behind,

18:46.516 --> 18:49.302
their success rate jumps
to 88.8%.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.565
Technically, the odds
are in their favor.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.480
Wait, but if Reign absorbed
Pestilence's powers,

18:53.523 --> 18:55.351
then she could still
become the Blight.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.485
Negative. I checked the vitals
of our sleeping Legionnaires.

18:58.528 --> 18:59.747
No Blight.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.270
That's a certainty.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.054
The only certainty.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.621
We have to help them.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.015
Supergirl's fight
is not our fight.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.060
Besides, we have
to get Imra home.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.106
Supergirl is stronger
than any Legionnaire.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.542
I have faith in her.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.029
So do I.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.163
I'm going to check
the stasis chambers

19:24.206 --> 19:25.555
for re-entry into our time.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.779
[Patricia groans weakly]

19:33.084 --> 19:34.260
[Supergirl] Patricia.

19:36.697 --> 19:37.915
Patricia?

19:39.395 --> 19:40.527
Hey.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.530
Stay with us.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.361
When you see Sam,

19:48.404 --> 19:50.667
you'll tell her
that I'm sorry.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
That I should have
held her close.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.501
And tell Ruby...

19:58.545 --> 20:01.939
Tell her that her grandmother
loved her. [crying]

20:05.291 --> 20:06.553
Promise me.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.427
I promise.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.301
[EKG flatlining]

20:15.344 --> 20:16.606
[exhales]

20:32.753 --> 20:33.754
James.

20:34.450 --> 20:35.843
What is it?

20:35.886 --> 20:37.671
Patricia Arias is dead.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.544
And Reign killed her.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.853
[Lena exhales heavily]

20:45.896 --> 20:48.812
And she absorbed Purity
and Pestilence's powers,

20:48.856 --> 20:50.988
so she's now
more dangerous than ever.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.643
Lena, you are going to have to
tell Supergirl

20:53.687 --> 20:55.602
that you know
how to make Kryptonite.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.951
Oh, no, no. [chuckles]

20:56.994 --> 20:58.344
James, you know
I can't do that.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.476
Lena, you have to.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.565
Okay, Reign is out there
killing innocent people,

21:02.609 --> 21:04.741
and you are the only one
with the means to stop her.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.134
You know what happened

21:06.177 --> 21:07.614
when I told Supergirl
I had Kryptonite.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.746
Years of goodwill
vanished in an instant.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.792
-I became the enemy.
-That's not true.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.099
You're not being realistic,
James, okay?

21:15.143 --> 21:16.797
We both know that Supergirl

21:16.840 --> 21:18.799
sees Kryptonite
as a personal assault.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.628
She sees it
as a hostile attack
on her very nature,

21:21.671 --> 21:23.630
and she will do everything
in her power

21:23.673 --> 21:24.718
to stop me from making it,

21:24.761 --> 21:26.633
even if I'm using it for good.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.766
I just, I can't...
I just can't allow
that to happen.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.116
You're right.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.423
Supergirl has seen Kryptonite
in a certain way,

21:34.467 --> 21:39.689
but that's only because
your brother tried to use it
to kill Superman.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.169
But this is different.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.171
The world's biggest enemy
happens to have

21:43.214 --> 21:45.129
the same weakness
as Supergirl.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.307
So if you come to her
as an ally,

21:48.350 --> 21:51.614
with this, to try to help her
catch Reign,

21:51.658 --> 21:55.052
believe me,
she will be grateful.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.057
[sighs heavily]
That's horrible.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.495
Um...

22:02.538 --> 22:04.627
Yeah. No, no,
thanks for calling.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.195
[sighs]

22:07.238 --> 22:08.370
What's wrong?

22:08.414 --> 22:09.850
Who needs your help, my mom?

22:09.893 --> 22:11.852
Uh, no. No, no one.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.507
Hey, why don't we
go watch a movie?

22:14.550 --> 22:16.683
Mrs. Queller told me that
they have Young Frankenstein,

22:16.726 --> 22:19.990
which just so happens
to be one of my
all-time favorite movies.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.165
Stop lying to me!

22:22.210 --> 22:25.518
Ruby, I'm not lying, okay?

22:25.561 --> 22:28.216
That call wasn't even
about your mom.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.391
She's fine.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.786
So, let's watch a movie.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.962
Right, I'm gonna go talk
to Mrs. Queller,

22:35.005 --> 22:39.706
and she'll hook us up
with popcorn and ice-cold
soda, and Gene Wilder.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.229
I mean, come on,
this is gonna be amazing.

22:41.272 --> 22:42.883
You just hang tight.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.058
I'll be right back.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.416
[car alarms blaring]

22:54.460 --> 22:55.722
[sirens wailing]

23:07.516 --> 23:09.605
You should be resting.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.782
[exhales] I need to
be on my feet.
Lying down is just so boring.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.089
[Supergirl sighs]

23:15.132 --> 23:16.656
[indistinct chatter]

23:16.699 --> 23:20.529
I told Patricia I'd give
a message to Sam, but...

23:20.573 --> 23:23.097
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna see Sam again.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.273
Even with everything
I've learned from Mon-El,

23:25.316 --> 23:27.797
Reign has me outmatched
on every level.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.453
J'onn, how am I
gonna fight her?

23:31.497 --> 23:34.587
Usually, your secret weapon
is your heart, Supergirl.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.241
But I didn't see even
a glimpse of humanity
left in Reign

23:37.285 --> 23:38.460
that you could reason with.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.505
[scoffs]

23:41.463 --> 23:44.335
White Martians
are as soulless as Reign.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.990
When you battled them,
were you ever able
to get through to them?

23:47.904 --> 23:50.298
Besides M'gann, no.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.822
But I just used my skills
as a warrior, like you.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.913
But there was one amongst us

23:56.957 --> 23:58.480
who thought they could
reason with them.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.569
And he did.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.007
He got them to spare his life.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.361
Father?

24:12.625 --> 24:16.150
Ursula, you should not
have come.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.195
When I told Kemler

24:18.239 --> 24:21.155
I didn't agree
with his position
on the Eradicator project,

24:21.198 --> 24:23.592
I wasn't looking
to be persuaded.

24:23.636 --> 24:27.509
Father, this is not Ursula.
This is Kara, my friend.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.469
Of course, you are.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.341
We came because we could
use your help.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.692
I'm of no help to any being.
Please leave me be.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.869
-Father, I just need to--
-I said no, J'onn!

24:39.913 --> 24:43.438
Dad, look, I know you
cannot journey through
your mind like you once did,

24:43.482 --> 24:44.657
I know that.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.181
But your memories
are still intact.

24:47.224 --> 24:50.619
None of it has been lost
since you've been doing
the Ta'ar Ka'riq.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.013
You just need help
to access it.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.449
I can do nothing for you.

24:55.755 --> 24:57.452
I've had enough failure.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.593
[Supergirl] Um...

25:07.636 --> 25:11.205
J'onn told me that
when the Greens
chose to fight the Whites,

25:11.248 --> 25:14.251
you pleaded with those
in charge to have open talks,
is that right?

25:16.819 --> 25:18.560
Everyone else
just saw their aggression,

25:18.604 --> 25:21.694
but you saw something
you could reason with.

25:21.737 --> 25:22.999
What was it?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.002
I don't remember.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.704
Father.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.880
Do not play tricks on me.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.882
[J'onn J'onzz] Just look at me
in this form, Father.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.710
Like you did
when you saw Ursula.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.234
You remembered exactly
your past conversation.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.844
Now, look at me,

25:41.888 --> 25:43.498
and tell me why you think
you can get through to me.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.282
Get through to you?

25:45.326 --> 25:48.590
[scoffs] You're as stubborn
and righteous as Phobos.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.941
I can't persuade you
of anything you don't already
believe in.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.814
Whites kept you alive, why?

25:54.857 --> 25:57.077
Because I knew
that the sacred scrolls

25:57.120 --> 25:58.774
were important to them.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.559
And inside my mind,

26:00.602 --> 26:03.910
I held all the knowledge
and secrets of those scrolls.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.389
And if they killed you,

26:05.433 --> 26:09.045
that knowledge would be lost
to them forever.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.831
You abandoned your own beliefs
and appealed to theirs.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.877
To their code.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.836
And Reign has been
pretty clear about
her code of justice.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.841
Father, you might just
have saved us today.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.278
[chuckles]

26:24.321 --> 26:25.714
I have?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.063
You have.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.499
[J'onn J'onzz
and Supergirl chuckling]

26:34.462 --> 26:36.116
We're approaching
the disruption.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.903
Mon-El?

26:41.991 --> 26:43.036
You need to go back.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.560
What?

26:45.604 --> 26:47.170
No. No, despite Brainy's odds,

26:47.214 --> 26:48.824
I'm sure they'll find a way
to defeat Reign.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.565
I'm going with you
to the future.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.741
We're near there.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.961
You're saying that because
you think it's what you need
to do for me,

26:55.004 --> 26:57.180
out of duty.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.921
But this time needs you,
Mon-El.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.402
You need to help them.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.970
And you need to go back
so you can figure out

27:04.013 --> 27:05.667
what's been weighing
on your heart.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.495
I'm with you, Imra.

27:07.538 --> 27:11.804
I risked our lives
and our marriage
to stop Pestilence.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.849
I still believe
it was worth it.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.808
I hoped that once we left,

27:15.851 --> 27:18.071
you'd put your feelings
for Kara behind you.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.682
I swear I never...

27:20.726 --> 27:22.118
You've done nothing wrong.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.991
You've tried
to bury your feelings.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.601
You behaved honorably.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.215
You must know that I would
never do anything
to dishonor you.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.390
I know.

27:35.741 --> 27:38.352
But I need a man, a partner...

27:39.745 --> 27:41.572
Who will choose me
with a full heart.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.270
Go back.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.621
Help her fight Reign.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.493
If you stay,
then that's your destiny.

27:49.537 --> 27:52.148
If you return,
I'll know you have no doubts.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.378
-Lena.
-Supergirl.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.988
I have something for you.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.990
But don't be alarmed,
it's in a lead-lined case.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.775
Is that Kryptonite?

28:09.818 --> 28:11.733
-To help you fight Reign.
-[Supergirl sighs]

28:11.777 --> 28:15.911
Oh, you have gall,
lying to my face.

28:16.738 --> 28:17.696
You know...

28:18.740 --> 28:20.437
I did not lie.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.962
This isn't Lex's, it's mine.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.746
I figured out how to make it,
and I did.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.400
And I supercharged it
just for Reign.

28:26.443 --> 28:27.618
You what?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.710
You are going to turn over
the formula to Alex.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.408
You are going to take
any Kryptonian elements
from your lab

28:34.451 --> 28:36.149
and bring them to the DEO,

28:36.192 --> 28:38.629
and you are never going
to make Kryptonite ever again.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.764
You know, I knew this is how
you'd react.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.724
But James Olsen convinced me
that we were on the same side.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.377
He thought
you'd actually be grateful.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.075
You think I should be grateful

28:49.118 --> 28:50.946
that you learned how to make
the one substance

28:50.990 --> 28:52.513
on this planet
that can kill me?

28:52.556 --> 28:54.689
Thousands of things
can kill me, Supergirl.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.126
And everyone else
on this planet.

28:57.170 --> 29:00.086
Fire. But we don't go around
banning bonfires or candles.

29:00.129 --> 29:02.697
Cars kill people every day,
and yet we still
have the courage

29:02.741 --> 29:05.004
to get in every morning
and drive ourselves to work.

29:05.047 --> 29:07.615
There is one element
on the planet
that kills a Kryptonian,

29:07.658 --> 29:09.182
and you can't tolerate
its existence.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.750
-No.
-You really do have
a god complex.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.277
Do you know what it's like
to walk into a room

29:17.320 --> 29:21.542
and your skin feel like
it's going to be seared
off your bones?

29:21.585 --> 29:24.763
Or like nails are running
through your blood?

29:24.806 --> 29:26.808
That's what Kryptonite
feels like.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.376
I don't know, it sounds
like exactly what you need
to subdue Reign.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.207
I need to be the only person

29:34.250 --> 29:37.340
in control of Kryptonite
on this planet.

29:37.384 --> 29:40.822
Even if I did trust you,
even if we were
on the same side,

29:40.866 --> 29:44.086
this substance
is so lethal to me

29:44.130 --> 29:46.915
that I can't risk
encountering it by mistake.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.962
Trust is hard for me, too,
Supergirl,

29:50.005 --> 29:51.528
but since we seem
to need each other,

29:51.572 --> 29:53.182
we're just gonna
have to figure it out.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.801
[cell phone beeps]

30:02.844 --> 30:06.369
[Sam and Ruby]
Hi, you've reached
he voicemail of Sam and Ruby.

30:06.413 --> 30:10.504
We can't get to the phone,
so leave us a message.

30:10.547 --> 30:14.377
Mom, please pick up.
I need to see you.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.945
Where are you?

30:16.989 --> 30:18.512
I just wanna talk to you.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.122
Please pick up or come get me.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.558
I need to see you.

30:21.602 --> 30:22.690
Please pick up.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.785
[Alex] All right,
I think I finally got
the projector working.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.917
You ready?

30:33.396 --> 30:35.181
-You okay?
-Yeah.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.926
[cell phone beeps]

30:41.927 --> 30:42.884
Ruby.

30:53.634 --> 30:54.853
[grunts]

30:59.901 --> 31:01.381
[alarm blaring]

31:01.424 --> 31:03.557
-What is that?
-That's Reign.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.516
Get downstairs now. Go.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.736
It's Reign.
She's at Lex's mansion.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.825
[grunts] Which means
she knows Ruby's there.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.393
With Alex.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.309
You can't go.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.745
You're still injured.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.747
But I can use
Lena's Kryptonite.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.705
There's no one else.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.272
Actually, there is.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.014
Mon-El.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.060
-The future--
-The future's fine.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.365
Brainy and Imra are still
on the way.

31:29.409 --> 31:30.889
Then why did you--

31:30.932 --> 31:32.238
To help you with your fight
against Reign.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.066
[exhales]

31:34.109 --> 31:36.111
[alarm blaring]

31:38.984 --> 31:40.115
[Ruby whimpers]

31:48.384 --> 31:50.125
[footsteps running]

32:00.570 --> 32:01.920
All right, come on.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.791
I want you
to go hide back over there.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.793
And keep your eyes closed.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.316
[machinery whirring]

32:32.428 --> 32:34.213
[breathing heavily]

32:34.256 --> 32:35.344
[loud clang]

32:44.788 --> 32:47.182
[whirring, clicking]

32:54.798 --> 32:55.974
[shrieking]

33:02.981 --> 33:04.243
[Alex panting]

33:12.251 --> 33:13.687
[Supergirl] Reign.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.167
Supergirl!

33:15.210 --> 33:17.517
[both grunting]

33:18.779 --> 33:20.346
[high-pitched trilling]

33:21.521 --> 33:22.739
[groaning]

33:39.800 --> 33:41.019
I can't get a good shot.

33:58.862 --> 33:59.863
[exhales]

34:22.364 --> 34:23.844
I got this, Supergirl.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.288
Mom?

34:38.728 --> 34:39.729
Mom?

34:41.166 --> 34:43.298
-No!
-Ruby, go. Go, go.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.388
Go, get down, down.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.090
[Supergirl] No, you can't.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.745
You would stop me?

34:55.789 --> 34:56.920
I don't have to.

34:56.964 --> 35:00.924
You have a code, a purpose.

35:00.968 --> 35:04.145
You fight against evil
and you dispense justice.

35:04.189 --> 35:07.496
You're here to make
a better world,
one without sin in it.

35:07.540 --> 35:10.456
But this girl has not sinned.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.285
You can't kill her.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.766
You won't.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.159
[inhales sharply]

35:24.209 --> 35:25.558
[gun cocking, whirring]

35:28.561 --> 35:29.562
[groaning]

35:34.697 --> 35:36.221
[sighs]

35:36.264 --> 35:38.353
-It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
-[crying]

35:43.663 --> 35:44.881
[device beeps]

35:50.104 --> 35:51.714
I owe you an apology,

35:52.672 --> 35:54.804
for being so hard on you.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.633
Without your Kryptonite,
we wouldn't have stopped her.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.201
You just have to understand
when it's Kryptonite,

36:00.245 --> 36:02.421
to me that's more than a gun

36:02.464 --> 36:05.032
or any of the other dangers
you were talking about.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.731
It's personal.

36:08.775 --> 36:11.038
It's personal to me, too.

36:11.081 --> 36:12.779
It was a way
to help my friend.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.087
I do trust you, Lena.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.046
Good.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.878
[beeps]

36:24.921 --> 36:27.576
If you'll both excuse me,
I'm gonna go work on a cure.

36:34.366 --> 36:36.237
Why'd you come back?

36:36.281 --> 36:38.413
Uh... [chuckles]

36:38.457 --> 36:42.939
Well, it seems that Brainy
might have put a nanny cam
in Winn's dirt.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.159
That's upsetting.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.814
So Brainy ran
some calculations,
and mathematically,

36:47.857 --> 36:50.904
the odds of you beating Reign
in her new form

36:50.947 --> 36:54.386
exponentially increased
if one member of the Legion
comes back to help.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.954
As always, I am thankful
for Brainy's calculations.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.869
But you didn't even need me.

36:59.913 --> 37:03.569
Beating Reign using
her ethical code against her?

37:03.612 --> 37:06.876
-It's ingenious.
-I have M'yrnn
to thank for that.

37:06.920 --> 37:11.316
And we couldn't have
contained her without you,
so...

37:11.359 --> 37:14.971
Hopefully, we can keep her
here until we turn her
back to Sam.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.799
Well, I'm not leaving
until the mission's complete.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.280
And I think we should train.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.716
Yeah, okay.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.936
But, uh, later, all right?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.633
I'm gonna go talk to Ruby.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.809
I promised her grandmother
I would tell her something.

37:26.853 --> 37:27.941
Sure.

37:37.646 --> 37:40.649
I have discovered the most
incredible thing today.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.609
Did you know,
if you grind the coffee beans

37:43.652 --> 37:45.001
with the cocoa beans,

37:45.045 --> 37:47.090
you get
the most delectable mixture?

37:47.134 --> 37:51.834
It makes the flavor sensors
of my mouth smile.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.707
[chuckles]
It's called a mocha, Father.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.491
"Mocha."

37:57.144 --> 37:58.450
Hmm.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.713
I would've thought,
"Choco-coffee."

38:02.323 --> 38:03.890
"Choco-coffee."

38:03.933 --> 38:06.022
You know, that does
kind of have a ring to it.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.809
It's so good to see you
up and around, Father.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.986
You should know that
we were able to catch Reign,

38:13.029 --> 38:16.381
thanks to your advice
about the White Martians.

38:16.424 --> 38:19.209
I have no recollection
of what you're talking about.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.955
Well, all you need to know
is that you helped.

38:27.217 --> 38:28.523
J'onn.

38:30.046 --> 38:31.874
Did you know,

38:31.918 --> 38:35.443
if you grind the coffee beans
with the cocoa beans,

38:35.487 --> 38:37.837
you get
the most delectable mixture?

38:37.880 --> 38:40.492
I did not know that, no.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.015
I'd like to try it.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.366
-Thank you.
-[chuckles]

38:51.198 --> 38:52.460
That was her.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.941
I saw her face.

38:54.984 --> 38:58.379
It looks like her, I know.
I know.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.903
But I promise you,
that's not your mom.

39:01.948 --> 39:04.733
Why should I believe you?

39:04.777 --> 39:06.996
You promised
she was gonna be okay.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.390
You're right.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.698
I didn't tell you the truth.

39:12.741 --> 39:16.397
I was hiding it
to try and protect you,
and I...

39:18.007 --> 39:20.749
I see now that that was wrong.

39:22.098 --> 39:25.014
I give you my word

39:25.058 --> 39:29.105
that I will do everything
within my power
to keep you safe.

39:30.803 --> 39:33.066
And from here on out,

39:33.109 --> 39:35.373
I will always
be honest with you.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.812
Is that okay?

39:46.558 --> 39:47.733
[elevator bell dings]

39:47.776 --> 39:49.561
[exhales]

39:49.604 --> 39:51.258
-[Lena] Could you hold
the door, please?
-Got it. Ooh.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.130
-Lena.
-Kara.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.437
-You are a sight
for sore eyes.
-Hi.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.308
I've been missing you
for weeks.

39:58.352 --> 40:00.310
I'm so sorry I haven't been
in touch. It's just...

40:00.354 --> 40:02.922
Oh, don't apologize
about anything.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.271
What are you doing here?

40:04.314 --> 40:06.360
-Ah, visiting Ruby.
-Oh.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.318
I didn't know what to bring,
so I brought ice cream.
[chuckles]

40:08.362 --> 40:10.495
That's a lot of ice cream.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.061
Did you hear what happened?

40:12.105 --> 40:14.281
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

40:14.324 --> 40:15.935
What an awful day for her.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.806
Yeah,
that's an understatement.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.721
[Kara clicks tongue]

40:19.765 --> 40:21.593
Alex tells me that
you're helping
Supergirl fight Reign.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.378
I'm sure she's so grateful
for your help.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.295
Well... Frankly,
I am only working
with Supergirl to save Sam

40:28.338 --> 40:29.470
because I have
no other choice.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.951
What do you mean?

40:31.994 --> 40:34.170
Well, it's that old adage.
"Never meet your idols,

40:34.214 --> 40:35.781
it'll only lead
to disappointment"?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.305
Oh, yes.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.525
Supergirl's not all
truth and justice
like she pretends to be.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.919
You know, she had
James break into L-Corp
and search my private vault?

40:46.574 --> 40:49.969
I'm sure she had
a really good reason.

40:50.012 --> 40:51.666
Of course, James didn't do it.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.973
-Really?
-Well, no.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.888
We've been dating each other
for months.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.934
He knows me, and he trusts me,
and I trust him.

40:58.978 --> 41:00.501
Supergirl went behind my back,

41:00.545 --> 41:02.372
and used my personal
relationships against me.

41:02.416 --> 41:03.983
That's something
my mother would do.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.375
She crossed a line.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.248
I can never trust her again.

41:10.772 --> 41:13.688
I didn't know what flavor
Ruby likes,
so I bought every flavor.

41:13.732 --> 41:14.994
[both chuckle]

41:15.037 --> 41:16.212
I hope you brought
your appetite.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.387
Oh, you know me.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.455
[man] Tanya, please stop.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.544
[woman] We wanna help you,
we promise.

41:43.588 --> 41:44.980
[man] In the name of Coville,

41:45.024 --> 41:47.417
please bring us back
the journal.

41:47.461 --> 41:48.767
[woman] Tanya!

41:55.338 --> 41:57.340
[theme music playing]
