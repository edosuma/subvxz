(truck horn honks)

00:04.939 --> 00:06.405
- (laughing)

00:06.407 --> 00:09.775
Narrator: The ice road truckers
have battled arctic conditions

00:09.777 --> 00:12.478
- Whoa! Get back, go back!

00:14.815 --> 00:16.215
Narrator: Extreme terrain...

00:16.217 --> 00:17.583
- Woo-hoo!

00:17.585 --> 00:18.984
- Stop! Stop!

00:21.589 --> 00:23.655
Narrator: And deadly ice
crossings...

00:23.657 --> 00:26.291
- We are on the ocean right now.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.060
Art: We broke through
the ice, man.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.628
Whoa!

00:29.630 --> 00:31.530
Narrator: To re-supply remote
communities

00:31.532 --> 00:33.432
At the end of the earth.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.534
- We are building our own road.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.236
Unbelievable!

00:37.238 --> 00:39.571
Narrator: Along the way
polar industries

00:39.573 --> 00:41.974
Became a winter road juggernaut.

00:41.976 --> 00:45.644
- I've dominated this area.
I've beaten my rivals.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.112
Narrator: While a team
of renegades...

00:47.114 --> 00:49.715
Mark: You're on my (bleep) turf
here, bud. My (bleep) turf.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.183
Darrell: It used to be yours.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.285
Narrator: Dared to go it alone.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.821
- We're just about
to cross enemy lines.

00:57.224 --> 01:00.592
Narrator: Now for the ice road
warriors,

01:00.594 --> 01:03.395
It's all led up to this...

01:03.397 --> 01:05.130
- Whoa!

01:05.132 --> 01:06.565
- Whoa!

01:06.567 --> 01:09.001
Narrator: A season ten years
in the making.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.837
- Ohhh.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.972
- Hang on. Uhhhh.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.674
Narrator: An unprecedented
heat wave

01:15.676 --> 01:18.310
Turns the winter roads
upside down.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.212
Mark: This is gonna be
the shortest season ever.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.780
Ice is literally melting.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.249
Narrator: Forcing the drivers
to risk it all...

01:24.251 --> 01:25.784
Lisa: Keep the truck moving.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.686
Narrator: In record time.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.089
Trucker: Yeah.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.691
Narrator: Over disintegrating
roads and rapidly thinning ice.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.061
- We're off to run the alberta
death roads.

01:36.063 --> 01:39.364
Narrator: To keep the companies
and communities alive.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.200
Lisa: Oh no! Ahhh.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.402
Narrator: The truckers
may have finally...

01:43.404 --> 01:45.003
(chain snaps)
- (bleep)!

01:45.005 --> 01:46.472
Narrator: ...Met their match.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.107
- Pretty rough.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.675
(truck thumping)

01:49.677 --> 01:51.710
Mark: Holy (bleep). We just
lost the (bleep) truck.

01:56.350 --> 02:06.391
♪ ♪

02:06.393 --> 02:16.502
♪ ♪

02:16.504 --> 02:24.109
♪ ♪

02:28.616 --> 02:30.616
Narrator: This season...

02:30.618 --> 02:32.017
(engine roars)

02:33.454 --> 02:34.953
...A weather event called
el nino

02:34.955 --> 02:37.189
Has thrown the industry
into chaos.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.492
(truck honks)

02:40.494 --> 02:42.895
Mark: There's a serious threat
that these communities

02:42.897 --> 02:44.263
Aren't gonna get all their
supplies

02:44.265 --> 02:45.964
And all the goods they need.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.033
We're looking at total
devastation.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.272
Narrator: El nino is a band
of warm water

02:53.274 --> 02:55.774
That develops in the pacific
ocean

02:55.776 --> 02:58.744
That disrupts weather patterns
throughout the globe.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.948
Causing crop decimating
droughts

03:04.385 --> 03:05.851
And violent typhoons.

03:07.221 --> 03:10.189
And in the north warm
temperatures spell disaster

03:10.191 --> 03:12.391
For the ice road truckers.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.697
At polar headquarters
in winnipeg...

03:21.235 --> 03:22.634
Mark: It's like spring out here.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.037
Hard to believe in February

03:25.039 --> 03:26.171
You're standing in a puddle
of water fixing trailers, eh.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.539
Narrator: Owner,
mark kohaykewych

03:27.541 --> 03:30.108
Is already feeling the heat
from the warm season.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.145
Mark: We would normally,
at this time last year,

03:33.147 --> 03:35.547
Had probably close
to a hundred loads out.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.549
I've got loads piling up
in my yard.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.618
Customers are freaking,
they're yelling.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.020
Narrator: The ice roads
aren't freezing

03:42.022 --> 03:45.591
And hundreds of vital loads
could go undelivered.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.928
Mark: Hey, I'm just checking up
on that winter road.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.496
Yep.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.333
Still not for awhile.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.636
Okay, no,
I got a lot to get in there

03:57.638 --> 03:59.204
So we're, we're starting
to panic.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.973
This is one of the first times

04:00.975 --> 04:03.375
That I'm faced with a situation

04:03.377 --> 04:05.944
Where we may not get all the
loads into the communities.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.913
Building supplies
may not get in,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.549
Fuel may not get in,
food may not get in.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.184
May not open at all.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.187
Oh man.

04:15.189 --> 04:18.190
They rely on us to get these
essential goods in.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.293
They need us and then we need
them to survive too.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.228
If you hear anything
let me know.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.763
Thanks. Bye-bye.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.500
Right now if you were to ask me
how we're going to do it

04:28.502 --> 04:30.502
I don't have a plan.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.937
Narrator: The company is
gearing up

04:31.939 --> 04:35.173
For a battle against
mother nature.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.675
And down the road...

04:39.546 --> 04:41.580
Polar's rivals,
darrell ward and lisa kelly,

04:43.717 --> 04:46.885
Are also feeling
el nino's wrath.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.689
Darrell: I think most of these
roads over here are closed.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.191
We're gonna have to hunt down
some loads this season.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.260
- Do they have a lot of loads
going out there though?

04:55.262 --> 04:57.663
They're just not open?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.897
- Well, I think there's a lot
of loads to go but no roads.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.601
Narrator: Last year,

05:02.603 --> 05:05.637
The former rocky mountain
log hauler...

05:05.639 --> 05:07.139
Darrell: This is a deadly job,

05:07.141 --> 05:09.241
Deadly job.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.343
Narrator: And alaskan
trucking icon,

05:11.345 --> 05:14.246
- Ugh. Yeah!

05:14.248 --> 05:16.281
Narrator: Formed their own
business.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.417
- Partners.
- Nice.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.719
Narrator: And despite
challenge...

05:20.721 --> 05:23.689
(ice cracking)
- ahh! Oh my gosh!

05:23.691 --> 05:25.390
Narrator: After challenge...

05:25.392 --> 05:26.992
- Oh, what am I doing out here.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.394
Have I lost my (bleep) mind?

05:29.396 --> 05:31.596
Narrator: ...In the end
they made their mark.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.998
(truck engine hums)

05:33.000 --> 05:34.399
- We have the power.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.867
- Oh, we do. (laughing)

05:35.869 --> 05:38.570
We have the power.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.707
Narrator: But this season the
weather's already threatening

05:41.709 --> 05:44.009
To sink their new company.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.644
- I don't know what
it's like up here.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.279
I haven't had any report on it.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.680
- That one's closed.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.048
- That one's closed?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.783
With this being a really
short season

05:51.785 --> 05:53.218
That's going to limit
how many loads

05:53.220 --> 05:54.619
We're gonna be able to haul.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.321
That could break a company.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.223
We need to keep this company
afloat,

05:58.225 --> 06:01.360
And scavenge all the loads
that we can find.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.095
Lisa: We might not end up
coming out ahead

06:03.097 --> 06:04.663
Or even breaking even,

06:04.665 --> 06:07.232
And then there would be
no more company.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.971
Narrator: As trucks sit idle...

06:15.109 --> 06:18.543
...A welcome cold front
finally moves in.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.579
(wind gusts)

06:22.015 --> 06:23.949
Todd: This is what it's all
about right here, baby.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.917
Oh, yeah boy.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.487
Narrator: And polar's the first
to strike,

06:28.489 --> 06:31.523
Unleashing their top dog,

06:31.525 --> 06:33.658
Todd dewey.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.562
Todd: There's just so many
factors I love about ice road
trucking.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.466
You know, you can feel the ice
flexing as you get on there.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.802
How far the cracks spreading
apart.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.638
Is there water coming up?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.507
Is this it?

06:48.509 --> 06:51.209
It's like a roller-coaster
ride of emotions.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.611
Mark: Hey todd, man,
what's happening?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.045
- Mark, what's up, bud?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.480
- Going up to pikangikum,
ontario.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.416
That road literally
just opened ten minutes ago.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.817
- Oh wow.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.385
- Take uh, take a load of
construction supplies.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.987
It's got a lot of concrete on
it so she is gonna be heavy.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.622
You're gonna get some
challenges out there for sure

07:03.624 --> 07:05.056
Cause she just opened up.
- Oh yeah.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.425
- That ice is gonna pop
for sure.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.227
- We got a window,
we're not sure how big it is.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.062
I mean, the weather is good
for us today

07:11.064 --> 07:12.597
But she's supposed
to get warm again

07:12.599 --> 07:13.999
So let's get whatever we can
in right now

07:14.001 --> 07:15.400
While the weather's like
this, okay?

07:15.402 --> 07:16.835
- All right I'll push straight
through

07:16.837 --> 07:18.203
Till I get in there, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.604
- All right, mark.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.039
Here we go.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.975
Narrator: Polar's maiden voyage
is a 200 mile trek

07:23.977 --> 07:26.077
To remote pikangikum.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.216
A brief cold spell has provided
a short window

07:31.218 --> 07:33.051
For todd to reach the community.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.221
But the ten mile lake crossing,

07:36.223 --> 07:39.124
One of the longest and most
dangerous in ontario,

07:39.126 --> 07:41.359
Has just frozen.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.297
Hauling over 25 tons
of construction supplies,

07:46.733 --> 07:49.301
Todd will be the first
to test it.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.103
(stream babbles)

07:53.907 --> 07:55.273
Todd: This is the first
time ever

07:55.275 --> 07:56.675
Out of all these years
of coming up here

07:56.677 --> 07:58.076
That I've ever seen open
running water

07:58.078 --> 07:59.478
All over the place.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.214
I have never seen that ever
at the beginning of the season.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.317
So I'm a little nervous.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.818
(truck engine hums)

08:06.820 --> 08:08.420
It feels like it's the end
of the season

08:08.422 --> 08:10.322
With the warm temperatures
we're having.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.756
It's just crazy.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.261
It's very vital to get these
loads in the communities

08:16.263 --> 08:18.730
So they can survive,

08:18.732 --> 08:20.799
But we're putting our lives
at risk

08:20.801 --> 08:23.668
Trying to get these loads
into the community

08:23.670 --> 08:27.072
And with the temperatures
fluctuating like they have been,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.741
I don't want to think
about what would happen

08:29.743 --> 08:31.543
If one of us went through.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.078
(truck rattling)

08:33.080 --> 08:36.781
A lot of stress, man,
a lot of stress this year.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.687
(truck roars and rattles)

08:45.659 --> 08:47.092
There is the ice.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.397
I'm definitely gonna get out
of the truck.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.865
I wanna go down walk
on the ice,

08:53.867 --> 08:55.300
I want to check it out,

08:55.302 --> 08:56.668
Just visually get to see it,

08:56.670 --> 08:58.503
Mentally prepare myself.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.205
(truck engine hums)

09:00.207 --> 09:01.873
Okay.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.508
(airbrakes hiss)

09:08.715 --> 09:10.148
(door slams)

09:12.619 --> 09:14.019
(wind howling)

09:18.825 --> 09:21.660
(eagle cries)

09:21.662 --> 09:23.061
(wind howling)

09:24.464 --> 09:27.432
This is the lake right here.
This is the ice.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.702
So what happens is you get big
cracks underneath this ice.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.404
The snow covers up the cracks

09:32.406 --> 09:35.040
And you can't see
where the cracks are.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.275
(ice cracking)

09:42.783 --> 09:45.717
You know, I'm a family man,

09:45.719 --> 09:47.852
And I love my wife
and I love my kids.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.358
And I could never,
if ever possibly imagine

09:53.360 --> 09:55.627
Falling through the ice

09:55.629 --> 09:58.863
And one of my crew members
or mark

09:58.865 --> 10:00.365
Or somebody having to call
my wife and say,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.667
"hey, you know..." (stammers)

10:04.071 --> 10:06.271
That really tugs on ya.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.380
It's just crazy out here
this year.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.053
(wind howls)

10:22.055 --> 10:23.755
(huffs, sniffles)

10:23.757 --> 10:27.592
Well, let's be the first
truck across the ice.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.895
(chains rattling)

10:32.966 --> 10:34.332
Here we go.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.903
I wanna get my frickin' door
open for one thing.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.739
(ice cracking)

10:40.741 --> 10:44.009
It is a cracking too, boy,
you can hear it popping.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.411
(truck rumbles)

10:46.413 --> 10:47.479
(wind blowing)

10:47.481 --> 10:50.415
Narrator: Comi

10:50.417 --> 10:52.450
Narrator: In northern ontario...

10:52.452 --> 10:54.619
(engine hums)

10:54.621 --> 10:58.289
Todd: Well, let's be the first
truck across the ice.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.860
Narrator: Todd dewey braves
the first open ice crossing
of the season.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.497
(chains rattling)

11:05.499 --> 11:07.198
- Here we go.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.269
I wanna get my frickin' door
open for one thing.

11:12.639 --> 11:16.374
It is cracking too, boy.
You can hear it popping.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.109
(ice cracking)

11:18.111 --> 11:20.679
Narrator: An open door provides
a quick escape route

11:22.082 --> 11:25.250
In case disaster strikes
over the ten mile crossing.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.785
(truck tires crunching on snow)

11:26.787 --> 11:28.553
- The thing about this water
is too,

11:28.555 --> 11:30.288
It's a couple hundred feet deep.

11:32.626 --> 11:33.992
The truck goes through

11:33.994 --> 11:35.393
It's going to the bottom
like a freakin' lead weight.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.495
As fast as it can go
and you're going with it.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.969
Narrator: Lake ice flexes under
the weight of the truck

11:44.971 --> 11:47.706
Causing a pressure wave
of water,

11:47.708 --> 11:51.443
That's powerful enough to burst
through the thinning ice.

11:51.445 --> 11:52.877
(ice cracking)

11:59.286 --> 12:01.753
(truck engine hums)

12:01.755 --> 12:03.922
Todd: Usually the ice
is a good 36 inches

12:03.924 --> 12:06.391
And they want it 33 to 36
inches thick.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.792
Right now we're crossing it

12:07.794 --> 12:10.295
In anywhere between
22 to 25 inches.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.797
That is a huge difference.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.268
(ice cracking)

12:21.208 --> 12:22.807
(truck engine hums)

12:28.515 --> 12:31.015
Oh my gosh, those cracks
are loud.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.417
(ice cracking)

12:36.423 --> 12:38.022
- Yeah, cause the ice is moving.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.226
The ice is actually moving
and it's cracking.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.162
(creaking)

12:44.164 --> 12:47.132
You can feel it rocking
like a frickin' boat, man.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.138
Come on, good lord, stick with
me just a little bit longer.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.540
Get me across this ice.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.842
Oh, those are some loud pops.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.844
(ice cracking)

13:05.085 --> 13:06.484
I can see the community now,

13:06.486 --> 13:09.621
But I'm not off the ice yet.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.189
(tires crunch on snow)

13:13.894 --> 13:15.960
Come on, you son of a bitch,
I am so close.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.997
(ice cracking)

13:22.602 --> 13:24.769
Oh, we're right there, baby!

13:24.771 --> 13:26.738
About ready to roll off.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.707
Come on, baby, come on, baby.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.379
Woo!

13:35.816 --> 13:37.182
Yes!

13:37.184 --> 13:38.583
Off the ice.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.119
Son of a bitch.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.921
Narrator: Back on solid
ground...

13:42.923 --> 13:44.989
- My destination. This is it.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.325
Got it into the little
community pikangikum.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.794
Conquered a badass
ice crossing this time.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.564
I mean a badass ice crossing.

13:52.566 --> 13:56.334
Narrator: Todd comes through
big for the small community.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.737
(airbrakes hiss)

14:01.575 --> 14:03.074
- Finally.

14:05.512 --> 14:09.747
Gosh, dang it! I can shake it
off and relax a little bit.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.017
So I'll go find my site boss guy

14:13.019 --> 14:15.053
And see where he wants me
to put the load at.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.121
(truck door slams)

14:17.123 --> 14:19.390
We really strive to get
everybody up here

14:19.392 --> 14:21.459
What they need by the end
of the ice season

14:21.461 --> 14:23.161
And we're not really having one
this year

14:23.163 --> 14:24.529
And that's pretty spooky.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.964
So we gotta a lot of miles
to do.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.365
Let's hit the road.
Let's get out of here.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.370
Narrator: As polar locks in the
first delivery of the season...

14:35.375 --> 14:37.175
Back in winnipeg...

14:37.177 --> 14:38.610
Darrell: Garden hill, huh?

14:38.612 --> 14:40.945
So how long is that road
gonna be open?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.714
That short, huh.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.216
Narrator: The competition's
not backing down.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.485
- You gotta get it in there
I can pull it off.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.954
Last year we went toe to toe
with polar.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.890
We took a big bite
of the apple.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.659
This year we're gonna devour
the apple.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.463
Yep, I'll do that.
Yeah, I'll leave right now.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.606
Narrator: The young company
lands a valuable new contract

15:08.608 --> 15:10.141
To garden hill.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.778
But to get to the remote
community

15:13.780 --> 15:16.614
Darrell will have to survive
nearly 400 miles

15:16.616 --> 15:19.050
Of brutal winter road.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.889
- I'm headed to garden hill
with a load of supplies.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.760
Hopefully, I can run straight
in, get unloaded,

15:28.762 --> 15:32.964
Get turn around get right back
out there without any issues.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.133
I like a nice clean run.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.669
(truck rattles)

15:37.671 --> 15:40.939
Nice clean runs are difficult
to do on these roads.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.943
Narrator: The village is
in desperate need

15:44.945 --> 15:47.312
Of the load of food
and medical supplies.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.349
But the warm weather
is making the rugged trail

15:51.351 --> 15:54.485
Even more difficult to navigate.

15:54.487 --> 15:58.289
- These roads are in pretty
rough shape this year.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.025
You can see where
they're gonna fall apart.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.162
(truck rattles)
ooh.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.866
Hang on.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.335
Ohh.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.237
They're rough.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.074
There's definitely rough
spots in 'em.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.742
(truck groans)

16:19.145 --> 16:22.013
You got places where there's
already dirt showing

16:22.015 --> 16:24.983
And as soon as the sun hits it

16:24.985 --> 16:27.752
It'll start deteriorating
in a hurry.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.254
Narrator: The winter roads
are made of hard packed snow

16:30.256 --> 16:33.458
Over frozen swampland
called muskeg.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.126
(truck groans)

16:35.128 --> 16:37.195
But el nino's warm temperatures
are melting it fast.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.599
Exposing rocks and uneven divots

16:41.601 --> 16:44.235
Making for an painfully
rough ride.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.172
(truck rattles)

16:48.174 --> 16:50.308
- Pretty warm out.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.343
The road's icy, slippery.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.179
(skids)

16:55.181 --> 16:57.582
Whoa.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.351
You can see the shine on the
road, that's how slick it is.

17:00.353 --> 17:05.089
The road's all shiny, you know,
sun's beating down on it.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.824
(tires screech)

17:08.228 --> 17:09.660
See that's pretty slick
right there,

17:09.662 --> 17:11.963
Load's sliding around.

17:11.965 --> 17:15.133
End up over in the rhubarb
if you're not careful.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.837
About ten kilometers up
there's a corner here

17:19.839 --> 17:22.073
And gets just slicker
than (bleep).

17:23.777 --> 17:26.210
Couple years ago old alex
jack knifed there

17:26.212 --> 17:28.112
And totaled his truck.

17:28.114 --> 17:31.215
Narrator: Slick roads mean
no traction

17:31.217 --> 17:34.552
And over the years has caused
drivers to crash

17:34.554 --> 17:37.855
Especially around corners.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.624
(truck engine hums)

17:39.626 --> 17:41.025
Alex: We're done.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.695
(crash)

17:46.332 --> 17:48.599
Darrell: You get these corners
like this -

17:48.601 --> 17:50.468
A little bit out-sloped

17:50.470 --> 17:52.437
And they're definitely slick.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.273
(truck groans)

17:55.275 --> 17:56.808
She's sliding around
a little bit.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.548
(skids)

18:08.822 --> 18:10.955
(truck horn honks)
whoa!

18:12.592 --> 18:15.860
Narrator: Coming up...

18:15.862 --> 18:17.895
Narrator: On the road
to garden hill...

18:17.897 --> 18:20.431
- Yeah, she's sliding around
a little bit.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.435
Narrator: Darrell ward's
on a collision course.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.239
♪ ♪

18:28.241 --> 18:29.640
(truck honks)

18:29.642 --> 18:31.142
- Whoa!

18:33.546 --> 18:35.947
That was (bleep) close.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.949
It was real (bleep) close.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.687
(airbrakes hissing)

19:01.107 --> 19:02.507
Narrator: Darrell's seen it all

19:02.509 --> 19:04.876
In his decades behind the wheel.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.178
Darrell: I've built the
pipelines across this country.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.714
I've worked in the oil fields
in north dakota.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.150
There's nobody better.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.285
Narrator: And he's never backed
down from a challenge.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.686
(truck skids)

19:15.688 --> 19:17.088
- Oh (bleep)!

19:17.090 --> 19:19.157
Narrator: From alaska's dalton
highway...

19:19.159 --> 19:21.826
- Yeah, this is alaska, baby!

19:21.828 --> 19:24.162
Narrator: ...To canada's winter
roads.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.796
Darrell: Beware of potholes,
soft shoulders,

19:25.798 --> 19:27.999
Washboards and drop-offs.
Perfect.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.335
Narrator: To starting his own
business.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.905
- Yeah, I was driving for
polar. I ain't anymore.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.640
There's a lot of loads
up for grabs.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.308
I might as well grab 'em.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.714
Narrator: But he's never faced
a challenge like this season.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.485
Darrell: The roads are goin'
to (bleep) this year.

19:47.487 --> 19:51.222
The roads-there is not enough
snow, there's no, no frost,

19:51.224 --> 19:53.858
No, you know,
nothing's froze good.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.826
Shoulders of the roads are soft.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.231
(truck whines, chains clink)

20:01.901 --> 20:04.168
Yeah, that was definitely
a close call.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.239
Be on my mind most of the day.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.475
I don't like close calls.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.745
Narrator: While darrell
hammers down...

20:17.650 --> 20:19.884
Only a 100 miles back...

20:22.121 --> 20:25.323
Lisa: Here's the start of my
long, long, long, long journey.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.758
See everything that
I'm driving is newly open.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.528
That means like,

20:30.530 --> 20:32.396
Well, it's good enough.
Better go for it.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.366
Narrator: Business partner,
lisa kelly,

20:35.368 --> 20:38.803
Secured the second half of
the garden hill contract.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.572
A mammoth 20 ton loader

20:41.574 --> 20:43.207
That could bring a big pay day

20:43.209 --> 20:45.810
To start the season
for the young company.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.846
Lisa: It's been a really
warm winter.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.049
Good ole el nino decided to mess
this winter up for everybody.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.584
That's why we need
to figure out

20:53.586 --> 20:55.653
How to get as many loads
as possible

20:55.655 --> 20:57.922
As quickly as possible

20:59.325 --> 21:01.726
So we can break even
or come out a little ahead.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.594
Wouldn't that be swell?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.029
(truck rattling)

21:08.668 --> 21:10.635
Uh.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.336
The ride is bumpy.

21:12.338 --> 21:15.973
They were right about it
being all tore up.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.876
When you got fresh snow
over all the bumps,

21:18.878 --> 21:21.145
I can't really see
where the bumps are.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.717
(truck bumping)

21:26.719 --> 21:28.352
Whoa!

21:30.923 --> 21:33.124
(truck bumping)

21:38.398 --> 21:41.699
Man, I'm seriously like gonna
get the wind knocked out of me
from this.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.969
Narrator: The hidden bumps
under the snow

21:44.971 --> 21:47.905
Are giving lisa a surprise
at every turn.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.711
But now...

21:53.713 --> 21:56.113
Lisa: You gotta be kidding me.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.549
Narrator: ...She'll have to
tangle with a 15 percent
grade hill

21:58.551 --> 22:00.785
And the loader's high
centered weight

22:00.787 --> 22:03.321
Won't be doing her any favors.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.161
(truck engine hums)

22:11.597 --> 22:13.531
(truck whines)
lisa: Come on.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.334
Good grief.

22:18.871 --> 22:22.039
Don't do this to me,
you damn truck.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.317
Ah. Gonna chain up now.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.922
Narrator: The truck doesn't
have enough traction

22:37.924 --> 22:40.591
To pull the heavy load
up the incline.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.661
- Stupid hill.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.396
Putting my chains on.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.633
Narrator: So she's gotta throw
on tire chains

22:49.635 --> 22:52.002
And hope it's enough
to get to the top.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.806
- This hill is slippery

22:55.808 --> 22:58.576
And then there's a corner
at the bottom.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.977
And when there's a corner
at the bottom

22:59.979 --> 23:02.012
You can't get the run for it.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.849
Here we go.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.318
See if I can't get it
to grind a little bit here.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.520
(engine hums, door slams)

23:09.522 --> 23:11.088
Narrator: If she can't make it

23:11.090 --> 23:13.424

what happens.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.980
Well...

34:11.617 --> 34:14.818
My gadget works. So far, eh.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.222
Narrator: With the quick fix
in place,

34:19.224 --> 34:22.025
Art will tempt fate
for the next 80 miles

34:22.027 --> 34:25.228
Over the rockiest stretch
of the entire trail.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.765
- Well, we just jimmied that
sort of speak.

34:28.767 --> 34:32.035
It'll pull down on them two
by fours anyway

34:32.037 --> 34:34.037
For a little while.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.174
Might stay two minutes,

34:37.176 --> 34:39.242
Might stay all the way
in there. I don't know.

34:44.149 --> 34:46.416
(truck rumbles)

34:46.418 --> 34:48.051
I mean, it might bust
and fall off yet.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.353
Anything can happen, eh.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.293
Narrator: As art soldiers on,

34:56.295 --> 34:58.562
50 miles to the north,

34:58.564 --> 35:01.665
Deep in the manitoba
wilderness...

35:03.702 --> 35:05.102
(thud)
- oh (bleep).

35:05.104 --> 35:07.504
I've run this road a lot
of times in the past.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.039
This is my first run back--

35:09.041 --> 35:13.043
Ohhh! This is my first run
in here this year

35:13.045 --> 35:15.445
And look at this, this road's
already falling apart.

35:16.849 --> 35:19.216
Narrator: Darrell ward's
closing in on garden hill

35:19.218 --> 35:23.720
Trying to deliver the first half
of a valuable new contract.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.122
(truck groans)

35:26.525 --> 35:29.159
- This road's rougher than
(bleep).

35:29.161 --> 35:30.760
(trailer squealing)

35:32.164 --> 35:34.831
Good thing I'm not hauling eggs.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.302
I'd have scrambled eggs
if I did.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.670
Narrator: But the blistering sun

35:40.672 --> 35:42.472
Has made the final 20 miles

35:42.474 --> 35:44.474
The toughest of the journey.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.944
- Holy (bleep), I'm doing...

35:47.946 --> 35:50.747
I'm doing 20 kilometers
an hour and...

35:50.749 --> 35:52.816
It's rough, it's rough.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.185
(truck thumping)

35:55.187 --> 35:57.521
Oh yeah.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.957
It's kinda like riding a bull
in the rodeo.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.359
(truck thumping)

36:02.361 --> 36:03.760
I had a couple of girlfriends
like this.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.462
It was a rough ride.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.666
I'm gonna ride these bumps.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.640
Narrator: Finally...

36:16.642 --> 36:19.442
Darrell: Right on. I'm just
rolling into garden hill.

36:19.444 --> 36:22.045
I'm gonna pull up here where
I've off-loaded in the past

36:22.047 --> 36:25.081
And, uh, see if this is
where they want it.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.551
Narrator: Darrell makes it
to the tiny village.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.555
- Let's get rid of this load.

36:31.557 --> 36:34.724
Narrator: And despite the
challenges of the warm season,

36:34.726 --> 36:38.295
The young company's delivered
their first load of the year.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.297
Darrell: It's really hard being
a small company on the winter
roads.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.432
You have to deliver your loads
on time.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.568
I depend on lisa,
lisa depends on me

36:44.570 --> 36:46.937
And the community depends
on the both of us.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.244
Narrator: Night falls
on the winter roads.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.450
Lisa: Almost there.
Almost there. Almost there.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.786
Narrator: And darrell's
business partner, lisa kelly,

37:02.788 --> 37:05.555
Also arrives at the distant
community.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.124
Lisa: Just got to garden hill.
I made it.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.493
Narrator: Coming through big
for the company

37:10.495 --> 37:13.930
With the second half
of the contract.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.266
- They were worried
I was gonna be late

37:16.268 --> 37:18.034
But I think they're just happy
that they get their stuff.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.437
(beeping)

37:20.439 --> 37:22.539
It is actually a concern that we
get these loads to these people

37:22.541 --> 37:24.908
Cause there just might not
be a big enough window.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.643
And the communities having their
supplies is what really counts

37:26.645 --> 37:28.044
And what really matters.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.679
I mean, it'd be great
if we come out ahead,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.448
But what matters is that
they have what they need

37:31.450 --> 37:33.016
Before they go into summer.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.819
Batta-boom.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.520
I'm outta here.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.959
Narrator: Coming up...

37:42.961 --> 37:45.161
Narrator: In the manitoba
back country...

37:48.734 --> 37:50.367
- We're getting close, b'y.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.037
(frustrated groan)

37:54.039 --> 37:55.572
Narrator: Art burke's
pushing down

37:55.574 --> 37:58.708
The final few brutal miles
to wasagamack.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.779
Art: I'll be glad
when we get there.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.247
Been gettin' the (bleep)
kicked out of me now

38:04.249 --> 38:05.615
Since seven o'clock
this morning.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.983
It's all right
when I get used to it

38:06.985 --> 38:09.019
But she been a rough road, eh.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.455
(truck thumping)

38:12.457 --> 38:15.158
Narrator: And thanks to his
jerry rig,

38:15.160 --> 38:18.895
The 25 tons of lumber
is still holding on.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.299
- She's starting to get
a little bit loose, eh.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.900
Narrator: For now.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.869
(truck thumping)

38:28.840 --> 38:30.273
- We're almost where
we're going anyway,

38:30.275 --> 38:31.675
I think we're gonna be fine.

38:36.081 --> 38:39.082
Narrator: Finally, after
a grueling two-day run...

38:41.186 --> 38:44.020
- Well, we made it
to wasagamack, b'y.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.823
Narrator: Art reaches
his destination.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.758
Art: Our first load of
the season.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.126
I feel like somebody threw
me in the dryer

38:50.128 --> 38:52.062
And put in about five bucks.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.067
Well, my jigger randy made it
here, b'y.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.869
And it stayed,
and it stayed tight

38:59.871 --> 39:01.805
And it kept that wood
from falling off.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.074
Narrator: The wild card proved
to be an ace

39:04.076 --> 39:06.710
As his quick fix
kept the load secure

39:06.712 --> 39:09.879
And in the end, he came through
for the remote village.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.049
- It was a good day.
Little things happen, man.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.451
It was a good day.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.119
We're here.
That's the main thing.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.255
And we're all together
and we made it.

39:19.257 --> 39:20.824
That's what it's all about.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.294
Narrator: While the haul
may have made it...

39:24.296 --> 39:26.696
- Away we go again.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.331
Narrator: Art will still have
to survive

39:28.333 --> 39:30.600
The 400 mile trip back

39:30.602 --> 39:33.603
Over a rapidly deteriorating
road.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.639
- All this banging
and (bleep) crashing,

39:36.641 --> 39:38.174
If you're not used to it

39:38.176 --> 39:40.276
It can definitely (bleep)
you up.

39:40.278 --> 39:41.845
(truck thumping)

39:41.847 --> 39:50.553
♪ ♪

39:50.555 --> 39:52.822
Nine hours of this, eh b'y?

39:55.260 --> 39:57.527
Wanna say (bleep) it.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.396
Hang on here.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Oh my god, my god, my god.

(truck engine rumbles)

40:35.667 --> 40:38.001
How in the (bleep) am I
gonna get out of this?

40:39.404 --> 40:41.404
(wind howls)

40:47.412 --> 40:48.845
Narrator: This season...

40:48.847 --> 40:50.280
(honking)

40:50.282 --> 40:53.149
Ten years on the ice
has all led to this.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.922
Art: Yee-ha!

40:58.924 --> 41:00.323
Narrator: Two companies...

41:00.325 --> 41:02.592
- We are absolutely behind
the eight ball.

41:02.594 --> 41:06.229
Narrator: In a desperate battle
against mother nature.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.531
Darrell: Look at the ice
cracking right there.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.899
What the (bleep)!

41:11.536 --> 41:13.169
Narrator: New hopefuls emerge.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.004
Steph: I'm gonna see if I can
bring these communities

41:15.006 --> 41:16.473
The relief they need.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.643
Narrator: And a legend returns.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.979
Alex: The temperature
is too warm.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.316
It'll be a very challenging
season.

41:26.318 --> 41:29.886
Narrator: As the ice road
truckers face a meltdown...

41:31.289 --> 41:33.756
- The sun is just slicking
the hills up.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.625
Narrator: ...Like never before.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.026
(crash)

41:37.028 --> 41:38.394
(chain snaps)

41:38.396 --> 41:39.829
- Oh my (bleep)!

41:39.831 --> 41:41.197
- (laughs)

41:41.199 --> 41:42.599
(truck thumping)
- aggh.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.000
- Treacherous son of a bitch.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.502
(crash)
- (laughs)

41:47.105 --> 41:49.606
Narrator: And nothing's off
limits.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.108
- The epic journey begins:
Darrell ward and mark.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.910
This is gonna be interesting.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.478
(drill whirs)

41:55.480 --> 41:56.846
Oh, (bleep) oh.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.414
I'm losing blood fast guys.

41:58.416 --> 42:02.318
(truck whines)
- ahh, I hate this so much.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.455
- Isn't this wonderful?

42:05.457 --> 42:06.956
(wind howls)
