- Will it still look
crooked, though?

00:30.033 --> 00:31.467
- 80% better,
which means you're still

00:31.533 --> 00:33.433
gonna have a little bit
of residual crookedness.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.400

08:11.667 --> 08:13.633

- Yeah.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.700
- And by the time
I had gotten home,

08:17.734 --> 08:20.133
it had gone too low down.
- Right.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.533
- And it basically made all of
this tissue up here swell

08:23.567 --> 08:25.767
and then kind of
caused an indentation.

08:26.033 --> 08:28.000
- Oh. Yeah.

08:28.033 --> 08:30.033
- And then,
during the second surgery,

08:30.066 --> 08:32.767
they must have nicked something
coming out this side,

started filling with fluid.

with a deformity there?

08:36.700 --> 08:38.133

some weird, like,

08:38.166 --> 08:39.767
side-boob thing
with no fat in it.

08:40.033 --> 08:41.533
It's just skin.
- Okay.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.533
And the left, did they try
to correct the concavity?

08:43.567 --> 08:44.533
- Yeah, that was
their first correction

08:45.500 --> 08:47.667

and after that had healed,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.133
it was obvious
that that wasn't enough,

to see what the doctors
can offer for me.

17:54.467 --> 17:56.300
- So what happened?
- When we were younger,

17:56.333 --> 18:00.100
my sister blindfolded my head,
and she grabbed the other and,

18:00.166 --> 18:02.600
and she just took off running,
and then she just,

18:02.633 --> 18:04.700
like, schwacked me
into a wood beam pole.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.066
- Oh.

18:06.100 --> 18:06.767
- You ran into
a wood beam pole?

18:07.633 --> 18:08.467
- Yeah, face...
- Note to self.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.300
Do not put on a blindfold

18:10.367 --> 18:13.133
and run around
where there are poles.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.300
Never a good idea.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.567
But you decided
to get it fixed.

18:15.633 --> 18:17.166
- Out of nowhere,
started to get,

18:17.233 --> 18:19.333
like, massive panic attacks.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.433
Everybody was like, "We don't
know what's wrong with you.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.200
We don't know
what's wrong with you."

18:22.233 --> 18:24.300
So then, one day, I finally
went to go see a physician,

18:24.367 --> 18:26.667
and he goes, "Your septum
is leaning in on your..."

18:26.734 --> 18:28.533
- Airway.
- Airway.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.667
And he goes, "This could be
a big factor for your anxiety."

18:30.734 --> 18:33.600
- Breathing is one of the basic
physiologic functions,

18:33.633 --> 18:37.133
and if you have an inability
to breathe properly,

18:37.200 --> 18:40.533
that can easily give you
a panic attack.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.700
- So then he was like, "I'm
gonna refer you to an ENT."

18:42.767 --> 18:43.633
- Yeah.

18:44.533 --> 18:45.333
- And as soon as he saw me,
he was like,

18:46.166 --> 18:46.333
"We're gonna get you
all fixed up.

18:47.000 --> 18:47.266
"I'm gonna give you, like,

18:48.133 --> 18:49.700
a really cute, perfect,
straight nose."

18:49.767 --> 18:51.300
- Okay.
- I'd sign up.

18:51.367 --> 18:54.200
- So he signed me up
for the following Thursday,

18:54.266 --> 18:56.633
and when I walked in,
he never came to check on me.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.367
I asked the nurse
if he was gonna come in,

18:58.400 --> 19:00.700
and she told me no, he's been
doing this for so long,

19:00.767 --> 19:02.367
we don't need to come in here,
and then she goes,

19:02.400 --> 19:04.033
"If you're nervous, go ahead
and take your own medication.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.500
We'll be back
in a few minutes."

19:05.533 --> 19:07.233
- Right before anesthesia?
- Wow.

19:07.266 --> 19:08.500
- Right.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.100
- Hearing
that Nesreen's doctor

19:10.133 --> 19:11.100
wouldn't speak to her
before surgery,

19:12.100 --> 19:12.133
and the nurse
is telling Nesreen,

19:13.033 --> 19:14.033
"Go ahead and take
a Xanax on your own,"

19:14.100 --> 19:15.066
if that was me,
I'd get up and I would leave.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.633
- After the surgery,
he took off the bandages,

19:17.667 --> 19:21.166
and I saw this bone
sticking out over here.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.500
- It's completely worse.
- Yeah.

19:22.533 --> 19:25.133
It went from, "Oh,
what happened to your nose,"

19:25.166 --> 19:27.233
to, "Whoa," like, "your face."

19:27.300 --> 19:29.266
In Middle Eastern culture, a
lot of our women, they cover,

19:29.300 --> 19:32.133
so we emphasize
really on the face

19:32.166 --> 19:34.667
and, like, beauty,
and my nose is crooked.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.734
I just want to get it fixed,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.667
and I want to look awesome.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.400
- What are your goals?

19:40.433 --> 19:42.200
- My goals are to breathe
and to look normal.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.734
- When you say "look normal,"
what does that mean to you?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.734
- It's like...

19:47.000 --> 19:47.734
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

19:48.000 --> 19:48.734
I call my nose California,

19:49.000 --> 19:50.266
because it looks
like California.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.400
- Like California?
- Right.

19:51.433 --> 19:52.533
- So you mean straight.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.667
- So you want to make
your nose straight.

19:54.767 --> 19:55.233
- I want my nose straight.
- What we want to do right now

19:55.767 --> 19:56.233
is go examine your nose, okay?

19:56.667 --> 19:57.367
Let's go do that then.

19:58.266 --> 19:59.734
- It's time for Nes' nose
to be perfect,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.633
because this is not
gonna stop me anymore.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.667
- Okay, I feel fracture lines.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.600
Oh, wait. Wait a minute.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.567
It's like a free-floating
piece of cartilage.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.233
- Really?
- Let me see something.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.400
- Yeah.
- Can you see that?

20:11.467 --> 20:13.166
I can see
that the surgeon took out

20:13.200 --> 20:15.500
a lot of the cartilage
that supports the tip.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.700
Now we know
that Nesreen is gonna need

20:17.734 --> 20:19.633
a major reconstruction.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.533
So most likely,
we're gonna leave this alone,

20:21.600 --> 20:23.300
except smooth it out,
we're not gonna build that up.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.300
- Right.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.667
- Unless you want
a bigger nose.

20:25.734 --> 20:27.700
- No, I don't want
a bigger nose.

20:27.734 --> 20:30.166
- Then when we get to
the lower part of the nose,

20:30.200 --> 20:31.700
I'm gonna have to add
cartilage to both sides.

20:31.734 --> 20:34.166
Now, cartilage has memory,

20:34.200 --> 20:36.500
which means no matter
how good of a job I do,

20:36.567 --> 20:37.667
there is a chance

20:37.734 --> 20:40.700
that some of it
may become deviated again.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.166
- I always thought,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.467
once you're fixed,
you're fixed.

20:44.734 --> 20:46.433
This is the thing that scares
me the most right now--

20:46.467 --> 20:48.533
waking up one day
and just went back

20:48.600 --> 20:51.700
to where it was
'cause it felt like it.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.600
- If we can get,
like, 80% straighter

20:54.633 --> 20:57.333
and more symmetric,
would you be happy?

20:57.367 --> 20:59.033
- Will it still look
crooked, though?

20:59.100 --> 21:00.700
- 80% better, which means
you're still gonna have

21:00.767 --> 21:02.133
a little bit
of residual crookedness.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.033
- I think at this point,
like, your nose is so bad,

21:05.100 --> 21:06.033
take that 80%.

21:06.100 --> 21:09.000
- I'm feeling a little bit

21:09.066 --> 21:11.333
of perfectionistic
or unrealistic

21:11.367 --> 21:13.033
expectations from you.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.433
And that's why I'm
kind of pounding it in you

21:15.500 --> 21:18.600
that we're gonna work
on getting an improvement,

21:18.633 --> 21:20.400
and you're gonna be happy
with your improvement.

21:20.467 --> 21:21.433
- Yeah, that's fine.

21:21.500 --> 21:26.200
80% to me is,
there'll still be

21:26.233 --> 21:29.467
that crookedness there,
but I put my faith in him.

21:29.533 --> 21:32.033
What I do love is that
he was honest with me.

21:32.100 --> 21:32.667

21:43.000 --> 21:43.767
that you have
on the left breast

21:44.000 --> 21:45.367
is the hardest thing you have,

21:45.400 --> 21:46.734

21:53.500 --> 21:55.333
do it better
or something, right?

21:55.400 --> 21:58.600
- Going into this surgery,
I'm pretty anxious.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.300
It's really scary
thinking that, you know,

22:00.367 --> 22:01.700
I could possibly
have a result

22:01.767 --> 22:03.567
that I'm still
gonna be unhappy with

22:03.633 --> 22:05.100
and have to live with.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.300
- Luke really wants to feel
comfortable in his own skin.

22:08.367 --> 22:11.734
He's had four previous
breast surgeries.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.567
This is hopefully
the final step to allow him

22:15.600 --> 22:18.767
to feel like he's done
with his transition.

22:19.033 --> 22:19.734
Today, for Luke's surgery,

22:20.700 --> 22:21.467
I'll begin
by making an incision

22:22.467 --> 22:22.767
around the perimeter
of the areolas

22:24.233 --> 22:26.100
and releasing them completely
from the surrounding skin.

22:26.166 --> 22:29.000
Then I'll perform
an areola reduction,

22:29.033 --> 22:32.667
reducing their size and sewing
the skin back to the areola.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.533
Next, I'll remove
the excess skin

22:34.567 --> 22:37.000
at the bottom of Luke's chest
on both sides,

22:37.033 --> 22:39.734
and I'll fix
Luke's dented left areola

22:40.000 --> 22:41.734
by sewing fatty breast tissue

22:42.000 --> 22:43.400
underneath
to elevate the nipple.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.266
Finally,
I'll perform liposuction

22:45.300 --> 22:46.767
on both sides of his chest,

22:47.033 --> 22:49.533
which will result
in a more masculine look.

22:49.567 --> 22:53.734
All right, so let's start
by reducing the areola size,

22:53.767 --> 22:56.300
and we'll do that by cutting
around where the scar is

22:56.333 --> 22:59.667
and then making
another circular incision

22:59.734 --> 23:02.433
inside the areola
to reduce its diameter.

23:02.467 --> 23:05.300
Okay, now we're gonna try
to tighten up the loose skin

23:05.333 --> 23:07.033
in the armpit area

23:07.066 --> 23:12.000
and try to get this side
of Luke's breast flat.

23:12.066 --> 23:13.567
I call this procedure
a chunk-ectomy

23:13.600 --> 23:16.300
'cause, essentially,
it's no more sophisticated

23:16.333 --> 23:19.700
than actually just removing
a chunk of tissue.

23:19.734 --> 23:22.033
All right,
why don't we staple this up

23:22.066 --> 23:24.567
and see whether
this is gonna work.

23:26.467 --> 23:28.200

suture in now.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.300
Luke's right breast surgery
has gone

23:32.333 --> 23:33.633

awaits me on his left breast.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.533
This is the side
with the saucer deformity.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.433
Too much tissue was taken
beneath the areola,

23:45.500 --> 23:47.567
so first thing we'll do
is release it

23:47.633 --> 23:49.734
from the surrounding
scar tissue.

23:49.767 --> 23:52.600
Luke's infection
from his previous surgery

23:52.633 --> 23:54.066
left him with
a lot of scarring.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.066
I need to release
the scar tissue

23:56.100 --> 23:57.734
and figure out a solution

23:57.767 --> 23:59.734
to build up that concavity

23:59.767 --> 24:03.467

in its proper position.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.734
and what you need
magically appears.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.433
Sometimes, it's better
to be lucky than good.

25:04.467 --> 25:05.600
I think that's it.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.133
I'm pretty damn happy
with this.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.033
- Yeah.
- Let's close it.

25:09.066 --> 25:12.600
♪ ♪

25:12.667 --> 25:15.333
Our next patient
is Martina Big.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.433
She came in before.

25:16.467 --> 25:17.600
She had very large
breast implants,

25:17.667 --> 25:19.467
but she wanted to match...

25:19.533 --> 25:20.333
both: Her butt...

25:20.400 --> 25:21.767
- To her breasts.
- To her breasts.

25:22.033 --> 25:22.734
- She wanted more
buttock projection.

25:23.667 --> 25:24.400
We successfully advised
her against it.

25:25.300 --> 25:26.567
- Not to do it.
- Right. Martina is back.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.667
So she wants to see you now
about the possibility

25:29.700 --> 25:33.000
of doing something to her nose.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.667
I follow her on social media.

25:34.700 --> 25:39.000
Since we've seen her last,
she's made a few changes.

25:39.033 --> 25:39.633
- So let me guess.

25:40.467 --> 25:41.633
She didn't listen
to what we said.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.633
- See whether you can pick up
some of those changes, okay?

25:44.700 --> 25:47.467
So why don't you bring
Martina and Michael in.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.100
- Can you please send
in Martina and Michael?

25:50.166 --> 25:50.734
- Good morning.

25:51.533 --> 25:54.100
- Hello.
- Nice to see you again.

25:54.166 --> 25:56.100
Yeah. We met last year.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.166
I was a white girl
with blonde hairs.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.767
I changed meanwhile
from a white woman

26:01.033 --> 26:02.600
to a black woman--
to an African woman.

26:02.633 --> 26:05.467
- Wait, wait.
- By the way, just say it:

26:05.500 --> 26:06.734
"What?!"

26:06.767 --> 26:09.066
Paul is completely dumbfounded.

26:09.100 --> 26:13.433
I'm used to him being dumb,
but not so dumbfounded.

26:13.467 --> 26:14.734
- It is not fake.
It is a new medicine.

26:14.767 --> 26:16.433
- No it's not.
- Yeah.

26:16.467 --> 26:17.700
- No, this is not a medicine.
- This is real.

26:17.734 --> 26:19.100
This is Melanotan.
- No. No, it's not--

26:19.166 --> 26:21.066
- Well, it's a relative
of that.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.200
It's an MSH stimulator.

26:22.233 --> 26:24.033
- You actually
just change your skin.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.467
You're serious?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.467
- Anyway,
it's great to see you.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.200
- Let's talk. Have a seat.
Let's talk about this.

26:29.233 --> 26:30.734
- Thanks.
- Is this amazing?

26:30.767 --> 26:33.200
- The doctors are
very professional,

26:33.233 --> 26:35.467
but to shock Dr. Nassif so,

26:35.500 --> 26:38.467
it is a sign that Martina's
change is really hot.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.600
[laughs]

26:40.633 --> 26:43.467
- You had...
- [laughing]

26:43.500 --> 26:46.667
- Are you okay?
Can you handle this?

26:46.734 --> 26:48.600
- Did you really...
are you... this is real?

26:48.633 --> 26:50.667
- This is real.
- This is actually...

26:50.734 --> 26:52.400
- This is real pigment.

26:52.467 --> 26:54.033
They injected this in you, yes?

26:54.100 --> 26:55.467
- Yeah, in the belly.
- They gave you an injection.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.600
- In the belly.
- One injection?

26:56.633 --> 26:57.767
- Three.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.767
- So you've had
three treatments...

27:00.000 --> 27:00.667
- Yep.
- I had the same treatment.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.734
But for me,
it don't work so well.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.033
It's still an improvement.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.767
- So it's in a testing phase.
- Yes.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.033
- These drugs have been
around for years.

27:10.100 --> 27:13.567
You inject it,
it stimulates MSH,

27:13.633 --> 27:16.000
melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

27:16.033 --> 27:20.367
to increase melanin production
from melanocytes.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.700
When you inject Melanotan
into the body,

27:22.767 --> 27:26.567
it stimulates all the pigment
producing cells in your body

27:26.633 --> 27:29.033
wherever they are,
in your eyes, your skin,

27:29.100 --> 27:31.767
your hair,
to produce more dark pigment.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.400
So the drug I'm familiar with,
in this country, it's illegal.

27:35.433 --> 27:37.166
You can't even
experiment with it.

27:37.233 --> 27:39.700
These drugs are very dangerous.
Have you had any side effects?

27:39.767 --> 27:41.700
- No.
- Did you throw up?

27:41.767 --> 27:43.633
- Do you have any joint pain?
Pain in your--

27:43.667 --> 27:45.000
- No. No.
- No pain?

27:45.033 --> 27:45.734
- Was this
one of the complications?

27:46.633 --> 27:48.667
Describe that you would
go this dark?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.467
- Her melanocytes
are turned on.

27:50.533 --> 27:51.734
They're up-regulated.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.734
- Okay, but are they gonna
down-regulate,

27:53.000 --> 27:54.066
or is this it now?

27:54.133 --> 27:56.133
- No, this is
reversible, right?

27:56.166 --> 27:58.033
- Because the drug is new,

27:58.066 --> 28:01.734
he can't say the exactly period
how long it works.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.066
- But I want to go again,
because I like it.

28:05.133 --> 28:06.734
It's not a complication.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.166
I don't think
I'm going to wake up and going,

28:09.200 --> 28:11.600
"Oh, no, I need to
go back very soon."

28:11.667 --> 28:14.734
No. Nope.
I'm going to stay black.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.567
- As a doctor,
darker skin is better skin,

28:17.600 --> 28:20.033
because it's better designed...

28:20.066 --> 28:21.533
- To protect you from the sun.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.734
So do you plan
on staying this color?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
- Yeah.
- Do you like this?

28:26.066 --> 28:26.567
You want to be this way
for the rest of your life?

28:28.600 --> 28:30.533
- How many nasal surgeries
have you had?

28:30.600 --> 28:32.233
- Only one.
- You had one?

28:32.300 --> 28:33.567
- For a smaller nose.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.033
It was in the past.

28:35.066 --> 28:37.033
- What exactly do you
want to do with it?

28:37.066 --> 28:39.633
- A little bit wider--
a little bit like this,

28:39.700 --> 28:40.633
but this is too much.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.600
- So you want to take your tip,
push it in,

28:43.633 --> 28:45.767
and make your nostrils
also wider?

28:46.033 --> 28:47.033
- A little bit, yeah.

28:51.734 --> 28:54.734
- We want to learn more
about real African people.

28:54.767 --> 28:55.767
- Are you guys married?

28:56.033 --> 28:57.700
- No. We are still preparing.

28:57.734 --> 28:59.767
- Do you guys plan
on having children?

29:00.033 --> 29:01.100
- This is
an interesting question.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.700
- Not sure. This is difficult.
- A lot of people ask us--

29:05.734 --> 29:07.467
- Because the people are talk,

29:07.500 --> 29:11.200
"Will the children
white or black?" And...

29:11.233 --> 29:12.734
- Martina, Michael,
let me tell you something.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.066
No matter what color
your skin is right now,

29:15.100 --> 29:18.333
your DNA, your chromosomes,
are not dark.

29:18.367 --> 29:22.066
- There are no medicine to have
in fact on the DNA?

29:22.100 --> 29:23.200
- No.
- No?

29:24.300 --> 29:24.734
- No, and you don't want to--
wait a minute, trust us...

29:25.633 --> 29:26.333
you don't want to do
anything like that.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.600
- You change your DNA,
that's how you get

29:28.633 --> 29:30.767
cancers
and immunology problems.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.333
But anyway,
don't worry about that.

29:32.367 --> 29:33.767
You're not changing your DNA.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.233
- Let's get you in the room
and let's examine you.

29:35.266 --> 29:36.667
We'll examine your skin,

29:36.734 --> 29:37.633
we'll examine your nose,
and we'll go from there.

29:38.567 --> 29:39.767
- That's a good idea.
- Let's get you in.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.633
This is an opportunity
for us to examine

29:41.667 --> 29:42.734
Martina and Michael.

29:43.767 --> 29:46.066
They got themselves involved
in a crazy experiment.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.767
Now it's our job,
our duty as doctors,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.633
to make sure they're okay.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.767
I don't know,
I'm a little worried

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
about taking down the hunk,
'cause this septum,

29:56.033 --> 29:57.767
it's, like, not attached,
it's free-floating,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.233
so I'm afraid a little bit.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.600
Michael, did you gain
a little bit more weight

30:01.667 --> 30:02.767
since the last time we saw you?

30:04.066 --> 30:06.333
- Yes, a little bit more.
- A little too much schnitzel.

30:14.100 --> 30:17.033
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

30:17.100 --> 30:18.200
- Wow, look at you two.

30:18.266 --> 30:20.700
You guys are almost
the same color.

30:20.767 --> 30:22.066
Michael, did you gain
a little bit more weight

30:22.133 --> 30:23.734
since the last time we saw you?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.734
- Yes, a little bit more.
- A little too much schnitzel.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.066
[laughter]

30:28.133 --> 30:29.734
- Here, do you mind--

30:30.000 --> 30:31.033
- Yeah, so let's look
at Michael first.

30:32.066 --> 30:35.000
So all of these moles, Michael,
they've gotten darker?

30:35.033 --> 30:36.066
- Yeah.
- Yes?

30:36.133 --> 30:36.700
- Okay, so they did
become darker.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.667
So you need to go
to a dermatologist

30:38.700 --> 30:39.667
when you get back to Germany.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.600
I mean, when you have a mole,
and it turns dark,

30:42.667 --> 30:45.633
that could be a sign
that you may have a melanoma,

30:45.700 --> 30:47.333
so if you have a mole
that starts turning dark,

30:47.400 --> 30:48.767
go have it checked.

30:49.033 --> 30:51.066
So when I hear of someone
turning themselves dark,

30:51.133 --> 30:52.734
I'm wondering,
can that take their moles

30:53.000 --> 30:54.767
and make them cancerous?

30:55.033 --> 30:57.767
Put your head back for me.
Let me just take a quick peek.

30:58.033 --> 31:01.066
The septum is straight.
Well, actually, no, it's not.

31:01.133 --> 31:04.100
You have a deviated septum
all the way over to the left.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.400
Okay, turn your head that way.

31:06.433 --> 31:08.734
So your nose is really
over-rotated.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.133
Martina has legitimate
issues with her nose.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.600
Her nose is over-rotated,

31:12.667 --> 31:14.000
and she's got
a deviated septum.

31:15.133 --> 31:17.367
She is actually a candidate
for a revision rhinoplasty.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.100
What's interesting is,
you did have

31:19.166 --> 31:20.700
an over-aggressive rhinoplasty,

31:20.734 --> 31:23.033
which is something
that I always fix.

31:23.066 --> 31:25.767
What that would entail
would be me taking cartilage,

31:26.033 --> 31:29.066
most likely from your rib,
and I need one here,

31:29.100 --> 31:31.633
here, here to lower it,

31:31.700 --> 31:33.767
and something here.
This is all doable.

31:34.033 --> 31:35.233
I can fix your nose,

31:35.300 --> 31:37.166
make it look
a little bit less pinched,

31:37.200 --> 31:38.433
and lower it a little bit,

31:38.467 --> 31:39.767
which will not give you
that look you want,

31:40.033 --> 31:41.433
but for me to do what you want,

31:41.467 --> 31:43.233
I have to go the extra mile,

31:43.300 --> 31:44.700
'cause when patients come and
they want us to change them,

31:44.734 --> 31:46.767
let's say they wanted
to go from a male to a female,

31:47.033 --> 31:48.433
they go through a process,

31:48.467 --> 31:50.400
and they make sure in their
life, with a doctor's help,

31:50.467 --> 31:52.233
that that's really
what they want to do.

31:54.066 --> 31:55.734
- We would feel better

31:55.767 --> 32:00.066
if you lived with this skin
for a good couple of years.

32:00.100 --> 32:02.066
Martina has issues
that I can fix,

32:02.100 --> 32:04.200
and I want to help her,
but at the same point,

32:04.233 --> 32:08.300
it's irresponsible of me to
do what she wants right now.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.200
I really want Martina to wait

32:10.233 --> 32:12.000
before she makes
a decision like this,

32:12.066 --> 32:14.333
because one thing:
we don't know how long

32:14.367 --> 32:17.000
this crazy experiment
is gonna last.

32:17.066 --> 32:19.433
This is possibly reversible.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.000
Once I make a change here,
it's done.

32:22.066 --> 32:22.734
Live with this
for a little while.

32:23.633 --> 32:24.467
Are you okay with that, then?
- Yeah.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.734
- You're not gonna
go to Germany

32:25.767 --> 32:27.400
and have someone else
do it right now?

32:30.633 --> 32:32.033
- Good.
- I like the doctor's advice.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.333
I will take my time

32:33.367 --> 32:36.266
to learn more
about my new self.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.500
- Well, listen,
good luck with everything.

32:37.533 --> 32:39.266
You go see a dermatologist
when you get back.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.100
- Thank you for coming.
- Safety first.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.734
- Safety first.
- Very good. Thank you.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.467

33:15.133 --> 33:16.367
right now, reconfirming

33:16.400 --> 33:19.133
that you are not
gonna get perfection.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.467
- I understand.
- You're positive?

33:20.533 --> 33:22.133
- I'm positive.
- All right, so then

33:22.166 --> 33:25.066
we will get ready to get you
in the operating room.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.300
For Nesreen's surgery today,

33:27.500 --> 33:28.467
we'll harvest rib cartilage
while I open the nose.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.066
Next, I'll use a rasp
to shave down the small hump.

33:31.133 --> 33:33.000
Then I'll perform
a septoplasty and attach

33:33.033 --> 33:35.333
a PDS plate to straighten
her deviated septum.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.000
Using rib cartilage,
I will put in spreader grafts

33:38.033 --> 33:40.066
to open her airway
and a septal extension graft

33:40.133 --> 33:41.333
that will straighten out
her tip.

33:42.567 --> 33:43.767
Hopefully this will give
Nesreen a fully functioning

33:44.033 --> 33:45.767
and aesthetically pleasing
nose.

33:46.033 --> 33:48.100
I'm gonna go a little bit
longer in our incision,

33:48.166 --> 33:50.367
because I really want
to be able to get

33:50.433 --> 33:52.100
the better view
of the middle vault.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.333
She also has a small
open-roof deformity.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.066
I feel the nasal bones.

33:56.133 --> 33:57.500
Interesting how you can
feel they're different

33:57.567 --> 33:59.467
once you open up
all the tissue.

33:59.533 --> 34:00.633
- Hmm.
- An open-roof deformity

34:01.734 --> 34:03.133
is when there's a gap
in the nasal bones.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.400
Trauma can maybe cause
an open-roof deformity,

34:05.467 --> 34:09.100
but 99% of the time, the bones
weren't closed properly,

34:09.166 --> 34:12.166
and that means the osteotomies
fracture the nasal bones,

34:12.200 --> 34:13.567
wasn't performed properly.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.000
I'm just setting this open.
You--

34:16.066 --> 34:17.767
- And the rib
is gonna come out.

34:18.033 --> 34:20.500
- Okay, the septum is
falling off to the right,

34:20.567 --> 34:23.100
and we have to add support
to this to get it straight.

34:23.166 --> 34:24.567
I don't know.
I'm a little worried about

34:24.600 --> 34:25.600
taking down the hump...
- Right.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.033
- 'Cause this septum,
it's, like, not attached.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.000
It's free-floating.
So I'm afraid, a little bit.

34:30.066 --> 34:32.100
I'm finding one speed bump
after another.

34:32.166 --> 34:34.033
The thing that we felt
that she has in her nose

34:34.066 --> 34:36.166
that was moving around
is the floating septum.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.300
I have to now
reconstruct the septum.

34:38.333 --> 34:41.567
I'm gently taking off the bone
at the top part of the hump.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.333
Five, four, three, two, one.

34:44.367 --> 34:46.400
Okay. All right,
so that's down. Lookit.

34:46.467 --> 34:47.533
That's cute.
- Oh, that's nice.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.033
That's really cute.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.200
- After removing
the nasal hump,

34:51.333 --> 34:53.066
I have to close Nesreen's
open-roof deformity

34:53.100 --> 34:55.467
by doing the osteotomies,
fracturing the nasal bones,

34:55.500 --> 34:56.767
bringing them together again.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.066
Go ahead.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.600
[clicking]

34:59.633 --> 35:01.600
Go. Wait a minute.
Hold on. Let me think.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.533
Stop. Stop.

35:03.467 --> 35:05.000
Remember, this side's
already more narrow.

35:05.066 --> 35:06.233
It's caving in
a little bit here,

35:06.300 --> 35:08.200
but the bones are more narrow.
They feel pretty good, though.

35:08.233 --> 35:10.066
Okay, so I think
what we need to do is,

35:10.100 --> 35:12.066
we need to fix a PDS plate.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.533
Give me a 15 blade.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.433
Putting the septal
extension graft in now.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.166
Then we'll finish working
on the middle part of the nose

35:20.233 --> 35:22.533
and check to see
how straight the dorsum is.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
We did a lot of work
on Nesreen's nose today,

35:24.667 --> 35:28.033
and I hope that anxiety
she's having is gonna stop,

35:28.100 --> 35:30.300
because her airway
is a lot better.

35:30.367 --> 35:32.200
So I think we really nailed it,

35:32.266 --> 35:34.066
and then we'll see
how good your nose heals,

35:34.133 --> 35:36.467
whether it's 90%,
100%, 80%--

35:36.533 --> 35:39.100
we'll see.
Depends on you.

35:39.133 --> 35:41.000
- Bye-bye, California.

35:41.033 --> 35:44.066
- Mom, you know I know
that my life choices

35:44.133 --> 35:48.133
haven't been what you
would have hoped for me.

35:49.400 --> 35:53.100
- Having this surgery now,
it's amazing the difference.

35:53.133 --> 35:55.033
I'm super excited for
everybody to see me today,

35:55.100 --> 35:56.600
'cause I know
I look damn good.

35:56.667 --> 35:58.100
Hey, guys.

35:58.133 --> 36:00.166
- Oh, my God.
[all exclaim]

36:00.233 --> 36:01.333
- Ta-da!

36:07.166 --> 36:08.667
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

36:08.700 --> 36:10.266
♪ ♪

36:10.300 --> 36:11.533
- I thought you'd look
a lot worse,

36:11.567 --> 36:13.166
but it doesn't look bad.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.133
- Oh, it looks pretty bad.
It looks scary.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.200
I'm Bride of Frankenstein-ing
it today.

36:17.266 --> 36:18.400
- Bride of Frankenstein?

36:18.433 --> 36:19.433
- Yeah, that's why
I got the hairdo.

36:19.467 --> 36:21.200
- Stop it, Nes.
You're insulting

36:21.266 --> 36:22.100
Bride of Frankenstein.

36:22.767 --> 36:24.433
No, I'm just joking.
[both laughing]

36:24.467 --> 36:28.700
- Today, I'm feeling
80% stinky,

36:28.734 --> 36:32.600
'cause I haven't took a shower,
and I can't smell right now

36:32.667 --> 36:35.266
or smell myself,
so I feel smelly.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.266
- Hello, young lady.
- Hola.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:38.567 --> 36:41.133
- How do you feel?
- I'm feeling good.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.400
I am anxious to hear
if Dr. Nassif

36:43.433 --> 36:46.266
was able to achieve the 80%.

36:46.300 --> 36:49.300
- Took down the hump,
took down the cartilage here,

36:49.333 --> 36:50.433
and then brought your bones in.

36:50.467 --> 36:52.500
Then I took what we call
a spreader graft

36:52.567 --> 36:53.700
to open up that middle vault,

36:53.734 --> 36:55.600
which is making the nose
look more crooked.

36:55.633 --> 36:56.734
It got pretty straight.

36:58.033 --> 37:01.533
In surgery, I would say it was
about 97% to 98% straighter.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.567
- Wow.
- It feels great

37:03.600 --> 37:05.433
to see Nesreen
in good spirits,

37:05.467 --> 37:07.166
because you can tell

37:07.200 --> 37:10.700
that I have passed
her expectations by a lot.

37:10.734 --> 37:13.166
- Let me tell you something.
He was telling you

37:13.200 --> 37:16.200
to anticipate 80% correction.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.633
He got you 97%.

37:18.700 --> 37:23.166
To me, if that wasn't reason
for celebration, nothing is.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.433
- I'm overwhelmed to hear
that we got almost 100%.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.133
- We'll have to see
how you heal,

37:28.200 --> 37:29.333
see if that cartilage
has memory

37:29.367 --> 37:31.734
and to see if we lose some
of that 97%.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.000
In your mind,
I want you to think

37:33.066 --> 37:33.700
that you are gonna lose some.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.600
- Okay.
- It'll never go back to this.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.200
- But it might.
- But just the question is...

37:37.233 --> 37:38.600
- Slightly.
- Here we are,

37:38.633 --> 37:40.567
and we're gonna go like that.
- Okay.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.233
- So with that,
I'll see you next week.

37:42.266 --> 37:43.533
- Thank you.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.467
If my nose does start to bend
again, I should be okay.

37:46.500 --> 37:50.367
I mean, I'm not that conceited,
so I'll be all right.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.734
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

37:51.767 --> 37:52.633
Let's get out of here.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.200
- Want me to help you up,
or you're good?

37:55.000 --> 37:55.633
- Yeah. I feel
like an old lady.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.367
[upbeat music]

37:59.400 --> 38:05.200
I never knew just one schwack
into a pole could destroy

38:05.233 --> 38:08.333
so many things inside of me
and affect my life so much,

38:08.367 --> 38:11.500
so having this surgery now
and being better,

38:11.533 --> 38:13.367
it's amazing the difference.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.633
I'm super excited
for everybody to see me today,

38:15.667 --> 38:17.700
'cause I know
I look damn good.

38:17.767 --> 38:19.633
- When you look better,
you feel better.

38:19.667 --> 38:20.767
- It's a big step
for her career.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.066
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

38:23.133 --> 38:24.633
[all exclaim]

38:24.667 --> 38:26.367
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my God.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.767
- So beautiful.
- I love it.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.266
- You look amazing.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.266
- Nice.
- Oh, my God.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.500
- Profile, Nes.
- Profile.

38:34.533 --> 38:37.633
Before my surgery with
Dr. Nassif, my nose was dented

38:37.667 --> 38:40.767
and all the bones
were in all the wrong places.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.400
Now my nose looks beautiful.

38:43.433 --> 38:46.367
The state of California
has left my face.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.266
All the love you guys gave me,

38:48.300 --> 38:50.633
all the support,
standing by me,

38:50.667 --> 38:52.266
and bringing me
all my yummy food,

38:52.300 --> 38:54.066
staying up in the middle
of the night,

38:54.133 --> 38:55.567
I'd like to thank you,
especially Reina,

38:55.600 --> 38:59.300
for allowing me to take clients
here and start myself

38:59.333 --> 39:01.033
and get my name out there.

39:01.066 --> 39:03.500
Like, there's nothing I can do
to repay all of you back.

39:03.567 --> 39:05.000
Now that I'm all fixed up,

39:05.033 --> 39:07.700
I can finally start
doing tutorials on myself

39:07.734 --> 39:10.500
and show everybody
my face, my brand,

39:10.567 --> 39:13.000
and actually come out there
and show everybody who Nes is

39:13.033 --> 39:14.400
and what Nes can do.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.000
Can't complain
about my nose anymore,

39:16.033 --> 39:19.066
so I just need to move on
now, get over myself,

39:19.133 --> 39:22.667
and hopefully start
a new chapter in my life,

39:22.700 --> 39:24.033
and the sky's the limit
from here, so...

39:24.066 --> 39:25.000
- Love you too.
- There's nowhere else

39:25.033 --> 39:26.500
to go but up.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.000
Cartilage memory
still scares me,

39:29.033 --> 39:31.066
but I'm optimistic
at the end of the day,

39:31.133 --> 39:34.100
because the thing I love
about what Dr. Nassif did

39:34.166 --> 39:35.667
is it still looks like me.

39:35.734 --> 39:38.033
It's just a better version
of me,

39:38.066 --> 39:39.734
like a million times better.

39:39.767 --> 39:41.300
- Group hug, everybody.
- No.

39:41.333 --> 39:42.467
[laughter]

39:44.600 --> 39:46.567
- It's gonna be so great.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.767
Yeah. I'm so excited.
- Hey, guys.

39:48.033 --> 39:49.567
- Luke.
- Oh, my gosh, how are you?

40:03.233 --> 40:04.200
How are you?
Good to see you.

40:04.233 --> 40:06.033
- I am so excited

40:06.066 --> 40:07.333
to see Dr. Dubrow today.

40:07.367 --> 40:08.700
He didn't know
what was gonna happen,

40:08.734 --> 40:11.033
or he had to go in, basically,

40:11.066 --> 40:12.600
to see what he had
to work with.

40:12.633 --> 40:15.600
I'm a little anxious to hear
how everything worked out.

40:15.633 --> 40:17.400
- So I started with
the right side, okay?

40:17.467 --> 40:18.533
You always start
with the easier side

40:18.600 --> 40:19.633
and get warmed up
a little bit.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.500
That worked great. And so then
I went over to the left.

40:22.533 --> 40:24.333
When I made the incision,
I could see this nice

40:24.367 --> 40:26.500
sort of tongue
of soft tissue--you know,

40:26.533 --> 40:29.367
the usual breast-type stuff--
and it looked really healthy,

40:29.400 --> 40:30.767
and it looked good,
and it had a thick pad to it.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.467
I thought, "What if I lift up
that scooped-out areola,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.533
just advance it forward,
and put it on top of it?"

40:36.600 --> 40:37.700
That worked.

40:39.033 --> 40:39.767
You know, that's what you have
to do in plastic surgery.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.667
You figure it out
as it goes along.

40:41.734 --> 40:43.266
- That's awesome.
[laughter]

40:43.333 --> 40:44.467
- For Luke,

40:44.500 --> 40:47.333
having a male chest
is everything.

40:47.367 --> 40:50.667
I just hope I helped him
achieve his final goal.

40:50.734 --> 40:53.066
Okay, come on, baby.

40:53.100 --> 40:53.767
Be pink.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.734
[tense music]

40:55.767 --> 40:57.367
It's dead.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.567
No, I'm just kidding.
It's...

40:58.633 --> 41:01.000
[laughs]
That was crude.

41:01.033 --> 41:03.100
But you could see from my
expression it was fine, right?

41:03.133 --> 41:04.433
- Yeah.
- So right now,

41:04.500 --> 41:05.700
I'm very pleased
with what happened.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.100
You know, you have
a lot of healing to do.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.000
It will look disproportional
within each breast for a while,

41:11.033 --> 41:13.767
so it's sort of gonna be
swollen and tight and--

41:14.000 --> 41:16.533
- Yeah.
- But this should do it.

41:16.567 --> 41:18.567
- This surgery, as far
as my transition goes,

41:18.633 --> 41:21.633
looking how I want to look
and feeling like the man

41:21.667 --> 41:25.500
that I know I should be,
I think this is it.

41:25.533 --> 41:27.100
- Do you have any questions?
- Not at the moment.

41:27.133 --> 41:28.767
- No?
- No, I don't think so.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
- Do you have any answers?
- I wish.

41:31.033 --> 41:32.367

41:37.133 --> 41:41.100
When I went into my first
top surgery four years ago,

41:41.166 --> 41:44.533
my main concern was
just removing the breast.

41:44.567 --> 41:48.000
I thought that it would
be fine, and it wasn't.

41:48.033 --> 41:50.266
Now that I've had my surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

41:50.300 --> 41:52.633
I kind of finally know
what a good surgery

41:52.700 --> 41:56.033
is supposed to feel like
afterward.

41:56.066 --> 41:58.700
I feel a sense of completion
with my chest

41:58.734 --> 42:01.133
that has never
been there before.

42:01.166 --> 42:04.000
It's freedom. It's wonderful.

42:04.033 --> 42:07.433
I can't wait to really start
going forward in my life,

42:07.467 --> 42:10.433
being happy doing the things
that I never felt comfortable

42:10.467 --> 42:13.000
doing before
because of my chest,

42:13.033 --> 42:14.133
and I'm excited
to share in that

42:14.166 --> 42:15.633
with my friends and family.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.433
- It's gonna be a great summer.

42:17.467 --> 42:18.734
[laughter]

42:19.000 --> 42:20.533
He's gonna be so happy.
- Happy.

42:20.567 --> 42:21.734
- And comfortable again.
- I know. So great.

42:21.767 --> 42:24.033
Yeah. I'm so excited.
- Hey, guys.

42:24.066 --> 42:25.700
- Luke!
- Oh, my gosh, how are you?

42:25.734 --> 42:27.033
- How are you?
- Ooh.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.700
Look at you.
- Wow, you look amazing.

42:28.734 --> 42:30.433
- Wow!
- Wow.

42:30.467 --> 42:32.433
- Luke, oh, my God.
- Amazing.

42:32.467 --> 42:35.033
[cheers and applause]
- Okay!

42:35.066 --> 42:36.567
- Before my surgery,

42:36.600 --> 42:38.433
my chest was dented
on the left side

42:38.467 --> 42:40.567
and overinflated on the right.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.467
Now after surgery, I have
the pecs I always wanted

42:43.500 --> 42:45.734
and finally
the me on the outside

42:45.767 --> 42:47.734
that I've always been
on the inside.

42:47.767 --> 42:49.166
So I just wanted
to thank you guys

42:49.200 --> 42:51.734
for coming out here,
you especially, Mom.

42:51.767 --> 42:54.166
- Oh, man.
[laughter]

42:54.200 --> 42:56.633
- You know,
I know that my life choices

42:56.700 --> 43:00.734
haven't been what you
would have hoped for me,

43:00.767 --> 43:04.367
but I know how far you've come
and just that you were my mom,

43:04.400 --> 43:06.500
and that's all you had to be.

43:06.533 --> 43:07.600
- Aw, I love you.

43:07.633 --> 43:09.100
You're such a blessing
to me.

43:09.133 --> 43:10.500
[laughs]
- Aw.

43:10.533 --> 43:12.633
- Since Luke's surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

43:12.667 --> 43:14.633
our relationship has deepened.

43:14.667 --> 43:16.133
We've just been able
to spend quality time

43:16.200 --> 43:18.400
together through
the healing process

43:18.467 --> 43:22.500
and really reconnect and
realize that loving each other

43:22.533 --> 43:25.767
is the greatest gift
we can give each other.

43:26.000 --> 43:26.767
We love you.

43:27.734 --> 43:30.066
- Yeah, we love you.
- Ah, you guys are okay.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.133
- Oh, wow. Now I'm not sure
why I came.

43:32.200 --> 43:35.367
[laughter]

43:35.400 --> 43:36.734
