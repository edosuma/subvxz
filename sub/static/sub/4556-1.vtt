04:07.741 --> 04:09.265
-Sarah?
-Yes?

04:10.811 --> 04:13.006
Would you mind living in the country?

04:13.113 --> 04:17.607
Course not. You're forgetting
I was born in the country. It's in my blood.

04:19.486 --> 04:22.420
Someday maybe we can move back
down South someplace.

04:22.488 --> 04:25.116
I think that would be real nice, baby.

04:25.325 --> 04:27.919
Okay, I'm going to keep that in mind.

04:31.698 --> 04:34.132
-You know, I was just thinking.
-What?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.827
About when we first met.

04:35.902 --> 04:38.769
You were living on Somerset Street
with your sister, Lela.

04:38.838 --> 04:41.898
I was a young girl,
fresh from the country then.

04:41.975 --> 04:44.307
You had the biggest butt I ever saw.

04:44.377 --> 04:48.335
-Steve, if you don't stop....
-But it's the truth. Good-looking behind.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.814
Said to myseIf when I first saw it:
"She got to be from down home...

04:51.884 --> 04:54.682
"because they don't make behinds
like that in the city."

04:54.753 --> 04:55.913
Steve!

04:56.388 --> 04:57.821
It's the truth.

04:58.056 --> 05:01.685
Don't you men ever think
about nothing besides behinds?

05:01.960 --> 05:05.418
-Legs and boobs, but mostly behinds.
-Man!

05:07.132 --> 05:08.497
I remember.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.835
You sneaked through
the living-room window in the house...

05:11.904 --> 05:13.030
with that crazy Charles...

05:13.105 --> 05:16.631
-because he wanted to surprise Lela.
-Yeah, old Charles.

05:17.842 --> 05:20.003
He was in a hurry to get home
from that war.

05:20.077 --> 05:23.569
-He was your sister's first husband, right?
-No, honey, third.

05:26.083 --> 05:29.246
You all looked so good in your uniforms,
especially you.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.548
You know I didn't.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.488
I was so tacky,
I didn't want you to see me.

05:33.758 --> 05:35.692
I saw you. I couldn't miss that butt.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.252
However, I knew the next time
you saw me, I'd have it together...

05:39.330 --> 05:41.195
and you wouldn't be able to resist me.

05:41.265 --> 05:44.859
Yeah, I knew it, too.
I took you out on our first date that night.

05:44.935 --> 05:46.232
Yes, you did.

05:46.469 --> 05:49.267
-Those were some beautiful days.
-Weren't they?

05:50.373 --> 05:54.503
-Those walks we used to take in the park.
-You were the freshest man.

05:54.711 --> 05:56.906
I was only doing
what a man's supposed to do.

05:56.980 --> 06:01.178
-No, you were fresh, Steve Jackson.
-I wonder if that tree's still there.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.311
You ain't no damn good, you know that?

06:05.388 --> 06:09.085
I used to stop by that tree,
and we used to kiss.

06:10.260 --> 06:13.319
-I don't want to hear it.
-I used to take you out by that tree...

06:13.395 --> 06:16.558
and press you against it real hard
and you used to love it.

06:16.632 --> 06:18.031
-Stop.
-No, it's the truth.

06:18.100 --> 06:22.969
You'd hardly wait till I came and took you
to that tree and press you against it.

06:23.272 --> 06:26.173
You used to say, "Steve, press me again! "

06:27.376 --> 06:30.311
Steve, you know you lying.
You know you are.

06:30.379 --> 06:33.212
-You couldn't get enough of that tree.
-Oh, man.

06:33.983 --> 06:35.507
That was all an act.

06:35.584 --> 06:37.108
-An act?
-Yes, siree.

06:37.186 --> 06:40.586
-Sarah, you was hardly acting.
-Yes, I was, too.

06:40.655 --> 06:43.351
You just didn't know what was going on.

06:44.359 --> 06:48.455
I knew if I acted all shy and scared,
that would make you like me more.

06:48.529 --> 06:52.397
-Woman, you can't fool me with no act.
-I see you married to me.

06:58.373 --> 07:01.171
I got to admit you got me there, Sarah.

07:01.309 --> 07:04.608
But if I had to do it all over again,
I wouldn't change a thing.

07:04.679 --> 07:06.043
-You know something?
-What?

07:06.113 --> 07:09.571
After 20 years of marriage,
two kids, and three jobs...

07:09.950 --> 07:13.408
you still got the biggest butt I ever saw.

07:16.690 --> 07:18.590
You're my queen, Sarah.

07:25.699 --> 07:27.758
Thank you, my dear husband.

07:28.101 --> 07:31.002
lt makes me very happy
to hear you say that.

08:12.110 --> 08:13.509
Young blood.

08:14.012 --> 08:16.742
-What's happening?
-Same old, same as old here.

08:16.815 --> 08:18.407
Vacation starts today?

08:18.817 --> 08:21.809
-You decided what you gonna do?
-I don't know.

08:21.886 --> 08:23.649
Might walk the streets for two weeks...

08:23.721 --> 08:26.383
bringing sunshine and brightness
to lonely dudes like you.

08:26.458 --> 08:28.084
That's not funny.

08:28.292 --> 08:30.886
-Come on. I'll buy you a drink.
-Okay.

08:32.563 --> 08:33.791
How's your other job?

08:33.864 --> 08:37.765
Rotten, boring, and underpaid,
but thank you, Jesus.

08:37.835 --> 08:41.236
-Yes, Lord. Same here.
-Say, man, let's go to Zenobia's tonight.

08:41.304 --> 08:42.465
-Where?
-Zenobia's.

08:42.539 --> 08:44.973
You got to be crazy.
We ain't got that kind of money.

08:45.042 --> 08:48.034
Will we ever? Come on, man.
I feel like cutting loose.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.740
Bottle of beer costs $5 in that place.

08:50.981 --> 08:53.347
You only live once.
What you say, homeboy?

08:53.417 --> 08:55.907
Nothing doing. You ever been there?

08:55.985 --> 08:58.283
Yeah...and no.

08:58.354 --> 09:00.254
I dropped some people off with the cab...

09:00.323 --> 09:03.520
but there be some fine mamas coming
in that place.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.626
Count me out, young blood.
That's too fancy for me.

09:06.696 --> 09:09.529
Some fine mamas coming in there.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.322
No!

09:13.503 --> 09:15.130
To your vacation.

09:24.212 --> 09:25.873
Freddy, come here.

09:26.481 --> 09:28.813
You ever been to Zenobia's?

09:31.620 --> 09:35.784
Will you tell this man
about Zenobia's, please?

09:35.857 --> 09:37.586
What's there to tell?

09:37.659 --> 09:40.787
Once you go in,
you don't never want to come out.

09:41.229 --> 09:43.754
It's the hippest place in the world.

09:44.499 --> 09:46.899
You ought to check it out, Steve.

09:48.436 --> 09:51.563
Let's go tonight. Shall we check it out?

09:51.872 --> 09:54.340
I'll see how I feel
after Sarah goes to sleep.

09:54.408 --> 09:56.808
-After Sarah goes to sleep?
-Yeah.

09:57.678 --> 09:59.737
You mean you got to sneak out?

10:02.917 --> 10:04.111
This guy....

10:04.185 --> 10:07.621
You mean to tell me
you're so henpecked...

10:07.988 --> 10:10.684
that you got to sneak out the house?

10:10.758 --> 10:13.921
You better tighten up
on your married life, Jack.

10:14.962 --> 10:18.022
You tell her you're going out, and that's it!

10:19.065 --> 10:22.728
-You gonna leave Irma and go out, right?
-That's right.

10:22.802 --> 10:26.761
I'm boss in my house.
I'm the king. B-O-S-S.

10:27.740 --> 10:28.934
Sneaking out.

10:31.244 --> 10:34.077
Man, I snap my fingers
and Irma jumps up...

10:34.147 --> 10:36.843
and don't come down till I tell her to.

10:37.116 --> 10:39.277
-That's right.
-All right.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.713
-You name the time.
-All right.

10:43.256 --> 10:46.053
-You meet me at 1 :00.
-1 :00.

10:46.124 --> 10:48.649
After Irma goes to sleep.

11:08.814 --> 11:11.078
You got to be a member
to get in here, don't you?

11:11.149 --> 11:13.446
Yeah, don't worry about that.
Just look important.

11:13.517 --> 11:15.576
Act like we're into something.

11:36.674 --> 11:38.403
Your names, please?

11:53.223 --> 11:55.350
Will you wait here a moment?

11:57.827 --> 11:59.624
What's on that paper?

11:59.896 --> 12:01.830
Our letter of introduction.

12:02.032 --> 12:03.260
From who?

12:03.500 --> 12:07.994
I wrote it myseIf on some stationery
from the law office where Irma works.

12:12.174 --> 12:13.573
What it say?

12:13.876 --> 12:16.071
Says, "To whom it may concern...

12:16.211 --> 12:20.443
"the bearers of this letter are two very
important men in the diamond business.

12:20.516 --> 12:24.111
"Any courtesies you can extend to them
would be greatly appreciated."

12:24.186 --> 12:27.417
Signed Jerome Mordechai Wilkenson.

12:27.856 --> 12:30.416
-Who's Jerome Mordechai Wilkenson?
-I have no idea...

12:30.492 --> 12:33.484
but I sure hope
he don't show up here tonight.

12:38.633 --> 12:39.964
Gentlemen.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.149
Hello, Susie. How are you?

13:00.221 --> 13:03.054
I heard about you, Daniel! Yes, I did.

13:11.898 --> 13:14.765
-Gentlemen, how do you do?
-How do you do?

13:15.001 --> 13:17.970
-I'm Madame Zenobia Bunight.
-I'm Steve Jackson.

13:18.038 --> 13:21.235
-This is Wardell Franklin.
-Nice to meet you both.

13:21.575 --> 13:24.510
You look like you must be new customers.

13:25.379 --> 13:27.745
That's right. First time.

13:27.814 --> 13:31.772
I certainly hope you enjoy yourselves
enough to want to come back soon.

13:31.851 --> 13:34.149
You will find us candid and to the point.

13:34.220 --> 13:38.816
Your pleasure is our business,
and you'll find plenty here to your liking.

13:40.426 --> 13:43.088
-I already have.
-Why, thank you.

13:44.029 --> 13:47.089
Why don't you fellas move around,
find something nice to do?

13:47.166 --> 13:49.930
If you get bored here
and are looking for real excitement...

13:50.002 --> 13:53.460
there is always the room
with the red door in the back.

13:53.906 --> 13:55.840
-What's in there?
-Happiness...

13:56.976 --> 13:59.569
-or sadness.
-What do you mean by that?

13:59.944 --> 14:01.775
Why don't you go back there and find out?

14:01.846 --> 14:05.782
And, Mr. Jackson,
you behave yourself, hear?

14:13.091 --> 14:16.492
Mr. Jackson,
I think she was digging on you.

14:17.395 --> 14:20.159
-She sure is a fine-looking mama.
-Yeah.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.298
I thought I said that.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.371
-What you think is going on back there?
-I don't know. Hookers maybe.

17:30.982 --> 17:33.143
Okay, get your bets down.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.578
Coming out.

17:34.652 --> 17:37.416
Get your bets down.
Dice coming out. Leggy Peggy rolling.

17:37.488 --> 17:39.478
Right. Dice here for $100.

17:40.657 --> 17:44.491
-You got it. Anybody else want this?
-I'll take $200 of that, Peg.

17:44.561 --> 17:46.961
Who else thinks the dice is wrong?

17:47.030 --> 17:48.998
-Anybody else?
-Got you.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.264
I'm going to get in this game.

17:52.335 --> 17:55.270
-You're going to get your feelings hurt.
-Loan me some money.

17:55.338 --> 17:57.533
-No.
-Come on, man.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.097
You got to be crazy!

17:59.175 --> 18:01.109
-Give me some money.
-No.

18:04.381 --> 18:06.575
You brothers going to participate
or talk stuff?

18:06.649 --> 18:10.141
-We gonna play, man.
-lt costs $150 to get in this game.

18:10.586 --> 18:13.111
If you haven't got it, agitate the gravel...

18:13.188 --> 18:14.951
and take this lame with you.

18:26.802 --> 18:29.464
-We got the money, chump.
-Get down with it.

18:32.608 --> 18:34.768
Bet up. New point coming out.

18:34.842 --> 18:39.779
-That's right. $50 on the dynamite lady!
-That's right, my brother!

18:40.014 --> 18:41.003
You and me.

18:41.082 --> 18:43.516
I thought you said, "Let's stand."

18:44.719 --> 18:47.017
-Let's go, darling.
-Here we go.

18:48.556 --> 18:50.387
Seven, a winner!

18:50.992 --> 18:54.894
-I'm letting it all ride!
-Let it ride. That's right.

18:54.962 --> 18:57.931
$100 on Miss Peggy Leggy.

18:59.801 --> 19:02.030
-That's right.
-Let's go again.

19:02.102 --> 19:04.468
Here we go. One time more.

19:04.538 --> 19:07.098
-Eleven!
-Still rolling.

19:08.608 --> 19:11.543
-Don't touch a thing!
-Don't touch it?

19:12.446 --> 19:15.279
It's all right. How about just a little bit?

19:15.348 --> 19:17.282
It's all riding again.

19:17.651 --> 19:20.916
Now, all you big-time players
jump on that...

19:20.987 --> 19:23.148
if you think you can stand the strain.

19:23.223 --> 19:25.748
That's right, my sister.

19:25.826 --> 19:30.057
And while you at it, jump on that,
and $5 more for the church.

19:32.565 --> 19:34.760
Jump on it! Come on.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.893
Jump on it some more there.

19:37.269 --> 19:39.829
Your hand moves every time mine moves.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.839
-Roll the dice.
-Again!

19:43.409 --> 19:46.742
-Seven, a winner!
-There you go!

19:46.812 --> 19:50.543
How long you all been open down here?
l've been working for a living.

19:50.616 --> 19:54.484
-Yeah. I know, honey.
-Jump on it. You're my man.

19:54.553 --> 19:57.077
-I got your name and number.
-Right on, brother.

19:57.188 --> 19:58.849
Go ahead, brother.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.885
-Peggy, roll it.
-Here we go!

20:03.628 --> 20:06.290
-Eleven, a winner!
-All right!

20:06.364 --> 20:09.060
What I tell you? I believe in miracles!

20:09.868 --> 20:12.393
Yes, indeed, and Jesus wept.

20:13.938 --> 20:16.736
My goodness, are you still here, brother?

20:17.675 --> 20:20.974
-You must don't have no place to go.
-Here we go!

20:22.046 --> 20:23.979
-Seven!
-Hello, seven!

20:27.351 --> 20:30.013
-Nine.
-Place your bets.

20:30.087 --> 20:33.250
-Nine is the point, darling.
-Here! Now!

20:33.791 --> 20:37.659
-Nine, a winner!
-All right! Respect a sister.

20:37.728 --> 20:40.891
-Send all them to the pawn shop.
-Change the dice.

20:40.964 --> 20:42.056
Yeah, change the dice.

20:42.132 --> 20:46.398
Hell, no! If you all can't stand the heat,
get out the kitchen!

20:46.470 --> 20:50.270
-Harry S. Truman, December 17, 1952.
-That's right.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.899
I was in the kitchen when he said it.

20:59.215 --> 21:01.183
-Eleven!
-Hello!

21:01.250 --> 21:05.710
-The dice have no sense whatsoever.
-Sometimes I don't understand it myself.

21:07.056 --> 21:09.752
Here we go. Tap this. Tap it!

21:13.429 --> 21:15.659
Seven again. Here we go.

21:15.731 --> 21:20.429
You all come on. Please cover this area
because this money is waiting for friends.

21:27.943 --> 21:29.570
Be nice and live.

21:48.696 --> 21:50.357
All right, freeze!

21:55.302 --> 21:58.601
Anybody makes a wrong move
gets put full of holes.

21:59.206 --> 22:03.108
-We mean business!
-Do as you're told and you won't get hurt!

22:03.544 --> 22:05.842
-I can't believe this!
-Shut up!

22:07.448 --> 22:09.678
Everybody, hands up! Slowly!

22:11.018 --> 22:13.111
As high as you can get them !

22:22.962 --> 22:24.395
That's better.

22:24.530 --> 22:27.465
Move away from the table!
Line up over there!

22:28.368 --> 22:29.630
Hurry up!

22:30.536 --> 22:31.764
Move it!

22:48.353 --> 22:50.082
Keep your hands up.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.190
This ain't no time to get brave, turkey.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.861
Put it in the bag.

23:20.217 --> 23:21.980
Give me those rings.

23:43.239 --> 23:44.706
Keep them up.

23:54.484 --> 23:56.918
Just in case
somebody's wearing a heater...

23:57.087 --> 24:00.614
everybody strip down to their underwear,
ladies included.

24:02.225 --> 24:03.453
Move it!

24:06.662 --> 24:08.129
You, too, lady.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.230
I don't wear underwear.

24:10.933 --> 24:12.560
Don't play games.

24:13.102 --> 24:14.694
Just get it off!

24:26.815 --> 24:28.942
Lord, have mercy.

25:40.786 --> 25:43.220
Stay where you are for 10 minutes.

25:43.823 --> 25:45.984
Anybody tries to move before that
gets shot.

25:47.126 --> 25:50.687
I want to thank you, brothers and sisters,
for a very lovely evening.

25:50.863 --> 25:53.661
Never have so few owed
so much to so many.

25:54.199 --> 25:55.564
Good night!

27:05.401 --> 27:09.428
Amen! Truly wonderful!
Be seated, would you please?

27:09.939 --> 27:14.205
We want to thank our choir
for that beautiful and inspiring rendition...

27:14.277 --> 27:17.006
of a spiritual very close to our hearts.

27:17.112 --> 27:20.843
Now I should like, at this time,
to remind those of you...

27:20.916 --> 27:23.441
attending our church picnic next Sunday...

27:23.518 --> 27:27.784
that buses will depart from the front
of the church after the service.

27:28.290 --> 27:30.815
Now, we want to take a moment also...

27:31.026 --> 27:32.926
to ask the weak among you...

27:32.994 --> 27:36.623
to refrain from bringing brown paper bags
to the picnic.

27:36.965 --> 27:40.332
We're gonna have enough
brown paper bags with the lunch in them.

27:40.468 --> 27:41.492
You know what I mean?

27:41.570 --> 27:44.095
I mean, after all,
we are having a church social...

27:44.172 --> 27:46.435
and not a fraternity boat ride!

27:46.574 --> 27:49.805
Now, I repeat, there will be no...

27:50.177 --> 27:53.305
there will be no joy juice allowed!

27:54.114 --> 27:56.048
Let me hear what I said.

27:56.116 --> 27:58.710
No joy juice allowed!

27:58.786 --> 28:01.084
Would you repeat that for me
one more time?

28:01.288 --> 28:04.485
No joy juice allowed!

28:05.092 --> 28:08.926
We will, right after the service,
search all of the choir robes.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.455
I want everybody to understand...

28:11.532 --> 28:14.967
the buses will not leave
before the service is over...

28:15.602 --> 28:18.036
and he who hesitates will be left.

28:43.829 --> 28:46.855
I was hoping to paint the kids' room
before they got home...

28:46.932 --> 28:49.992
so they'd have someplace fresh
to come home to.

28:50.068 --> 28:54.027
Maybe we could shop for some
new carpets, curtains, and candles.

28:54.106 --> 28:55.937
What you think, Steve?

28:57.109 --> 28:58.269
Honey?

29:03.982 --> 29:06.007
Steve, I know you hear me.

29:39.382 --> 29:41.316
Having a good time, honey?

29:56.266 --> 29:59.064
Are you dreaming of me, baby?

30:05.574 --> 30:07.337
Dreaming of a woman?

30:24.026 --> 30:25.789
What you hit me for?

30:26.228 --> 30:28.355
You must have been dreaming.

30:34.969 --> 30:37.096
Who were you dreaming about?

30:40.541 --> 30:42.065
You did hit me.

31:18.578 --> 31:19.704
Sarah!

31:22.649 --> 31:24.912
-Steve, you all right?
-Sarah!

31:25.351 --> 31:26.909
What is it, baby?

31:28.654 --> 31:31.714
-Oh, my God, he's having an attack!
-No, Sarah.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.357
Did we.... Have you....

31:43.869 --> 31:48.203
The lottery ticket I found in your suit
when I took it to the cleaners?

31:48.474 --> 31:51.841
Is that a nine? Is that a one?
And is that a four?

31:51.911 --> 31:54.470
And is that another one and another nine?

31:54.679 --> 31:57.705
Nine-one-four-one-nine?

31:58.450 --> 32:01.977
That's my.... I won. That's my ticket.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.214
How much for? My goodness!

32:05.523 --> 32:08.151
$50,000.

32:16.301 --> 32:19.497
<i>Money, honey</i>
<i>Money, honey</i>

32:32.282 --> 32:33.749
What's wrong?

32:34.651 --> 32:36.084
The lottery ticket!

32:36.320 --> 32:37.947
Is in your wallet?

32:39.590 --> 32:41.785
That was stolen at Zenobia's?

32:41.959 --> 32:43.551
Does Sarah know?

32:43.894 --> 32:45.521
She mad, ain't she?

32:45.629 --> 32:48.722
-What you gonna do?
-I'm going to find that wallet, Wardell.

32:48.798 --> 32:51.392
-How?
-By any means necessary.

32:52.668 --> 32:54.192
I want you to help me, young blood.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.864
I'm your man, homeboy.
What's your first step?

32:58.207 --> 33:01.074
I ain't sure,
but we got to find those robbers.

33:01.143 --> 33:02.872
We can't go to the police.

33:03.646 --> 33:06.206
We can't trust them if they know
what's in the wallet...

33:06.282 --> 33:10.218
and if we don't tell them about it,
they won't waste time looking for it.

33:10.286 --> 33:13.483
So I figure we going to have to get out
in the street...

33:13.556 --> 33:17.685
and keep our ears and eyes open
until we pick up some clues.

33:17.893 --> 33:20.020
We can't get out there ourselves.

33:20.095 --> 33:22.757
For that kind of money? The hell we can't!

34:26.125 --> 34:28.821
Hands up! Turn around and face the wall.

34:32.364 --> 34:34.424
-Man, l--
-Freeze.

34:34.500 --> 34:38.629
No, see, you all got the wrong....
You're wrong. I haven't done anything.

34:38.704 --> 34:40.295
I want a lawyer.

34:57.121 --> 34:59.215
-l--
-Don't say nothing to me!

34:59.291 --> 35:02.783
Do you know
they was going to shoot me? Wardell!

35:03.061 --> 35:06.791
Mistook me for some big, ugly guy
with a beard and a mustache.

35:06.864 --> 35:08.422
-I can understand how--
-Shut up!

35:08.499 --> 35:10.160
We're not doing this stuff anymore.

35:10.234 --> 35:13.897
We're going to get someone who knows
what he's doing. A private detective.

35:13.971 --> 35:18.101
-Where will we find a private detective?
-ln the yellow pages! I don't know!

36:02.851 --> 36:04.341
Mr. Washington?

36:16.298 --> 36:17.959
What do you want?

36:20.069 --> 36:23.197
-We're looking for Sharp Eye Washington.
-Who looking for him?

36:23.272 --> 36:25.832
Steve Jackson,
and this is my friend, Wardell Franklin.

36:25.908 --> 36:28.205
-We want him for a job.
-What kind of job?

36:28.276 --> 36:31.973
Some property of ours was stolen.
We want him to get it back for us.

36:32.847 --> 36:34.337
Cost you $500.

36:34.549 --> 36:38.383
-$500? We ain't got that kind of money.
-$400?

36:39.153 --> 36:40.177
No.

36:40.655 --> 36:42.646
I think we gonna have to go
someplace else.

36:42.724 --> 36:44.021
How about $300?

36:49.597 --> 36:52.896
You sure you're Sharp Eye Washington,
the private detective?

36:54.602 --> 36:57.934
I'm Sharp Eye Washington, the one
and only. Never be another like me.

36:58.004 --> 36:59.665
We're working people.

36:59.740 --> 37:03.267
See, I drive a taxi cab, and I mean, $300....

37:03.343 --> 37:04.742
Oh, man.

37:04.811 --> 37:07.405
You don't know what it is
to be a detective. It's rough.

37:07.481 --> 37:08.743
People are looking for me now.

37:08.815 --> 37:10.840
-Who?
-None of your business who.

37:11.118 --> 37:13.177
Just make up your mind
because I got to split.

37:13.253 --> 37:14.618
How about $200?

37:18.425 --> 37:22.191
All you risk is $200, but I put my life
on the line in service to you.

37:22.262 --> 37:25.753
That's right. It's a lonely, dangerous life
being a private detective.

37:25.831 --> 37:27.958
All you do is risk a little money.

37:28.067 --> 37:30.592
I solve the cases, and people are after me!

37:31.137 --> 37:34.732
Look at my eye, my right eye.
See how bloodshot it is?

37:34.940 --> 37:38.569
Know how it got that way?
From sleeping with one eye open, baby.

37:38.644 --> 37:40.771
Life ain't easy. Always on the move...

37:40.846 --> 37:44.475
people after me with guns. Looking
under the hood of your car for bombs...

37:44.550 --> 37:47.383
peeking out windows,
peering down hallways.

37:47.953 --> 37:49.011
ln the movies, right?

37:49.088 --> 37:53.751
The movies always got some super nigger
killing some white boy in the Mafia...

37:53.825 --> 37:55.656
beating up the crooked police.

37:55.727 --> 37:57.991
That's not true and it don't help me either.

37:58.062 --> 38:00.121
And women. They all got women.

38:01.099 --> 38:03.829
Black detective in the movies
always got a woman.

38:03.902 --> 38:05.199
Watch yourself.

38:06.704 --> 38:10.606
I ain't had a woman in how long? Months!

38:11.309 --> 38:14.972
I might as well be a monk,
and that's what it's like being a detective.

38:15.046 --> 38:18.446
That's the real truth of it.
It's always steady on the case.

38:22.419 --> 38:26.287
I'm getting my thing together, too, baby,
because I'm Sharp Eye Washington.

38:26.356 --> 38:27.789
Steady on the case.

38:31.128 --> 38:34.757
We give you $50 down
and the rest when you find our property.

38:34.932 --> 38:37.958
You got a deal. Just write your name,
address and phone number.

38:38.035 --> 38:42.495
Like I said, you got nothing to worry about
because I'm going to find your property.

38:52.515 --> 38:54.608
The address and the phone number.

38:56.085 --> 38:57.177
$50.

38:58.287 --> 39:01.120
But we ain't told you what we lost.

39:01.757 --> 39:05.591
I was about to bring that up.
It's something very valuable.

39:05.862 --> 39:06.920
Yeah.

39:07.096 --> 39:09.997
-And it's more precious than gold?
-That's right.

39:10.633 --> 39:12.396
-It's a....
-Wallet.

39:13.368 --> 39:15.632
I thought so. What's in it?

39:18.340 --> 39:20.035
Some family pictures...

39:20.575 --> 39:24.170
and some...sentimental souvenirs.

39:25.013 --> 39:28.471
I thought it was something like that.
Well, steady on the case.

39:29.985 --> 39:31.612
Say, man. Hey!

39:39.294 --> 39:43.161
It's just my way of staying one step ahead
of the thieves and hustlers.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.222
Wait.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.197
I know. A wallet.

39:48.969 --> 39:51.665
Listen. Look, wait a minute!

40:03.984 --> 40:05.144
What's that?

40:31.110 --> 40:34.011
I'd like to get 300 tickets
to the policeman's ball.

40:34.580 --> 40:36.740
Your con days are over, Washington.

40:39.985 --> 40:43.443
-He stole our money.
-He stole a lot of people's money, fella.

40:43.689 --> 40:46.681
-We've been on your trail a long time.
-I was framed.

40:46.758 --> 40:48.658
You said that in Des Moines, lowa...

40:48.727 --> 40:51.389
where you were Cleophus Washington,
a preacher.

40:51.897 --> 40:54.832
You escaped from custody.
You said it in Jersey City where...

40:54.900 --> 40:58.529
you were Henry Hawthorne Washington,
a bogus lawyer. You jumped bail.

40:58.603 --> 41:01.265
Your clients are still waiting
for you to handle their cases.

41:01.340 --> 41:03.204
That's my cousin Clarence Washington.

41:04.008 --> 41:05.270
That's not me.

41:06.210 --> 41:09.145
Damn, man, we trusted you.
I mean, why us?

41:10.381 --> 41:12.975
-Why not you, brother?
-Take him away.

41:15.586 --> 41:18.578
Wait a minute. He stole our money.
What do we do about that?

41:18.656 --> 41:22.319
I advise you to go to file a complaint
for the return of the money...

41:22.393 --> 41:25.419
but let me warn you,
you'll be waiting in a long line.

41:27.031 --> 41:30.431
Is the Governor in town?
Get him down here. I want to see him.

41:58.293 --> 42:01.592
-Yes, may I help you?
-We'd like to see Congressman Lincoln.

42:11.173 --> 42:15.166
Excuse me, Congressman Lincoln, there
are two gentlemen waiting to see you.

42:15.244 --> 42:18.111
-Yes, of course, from the Mayor's office.
-No, sir.

42:18.647 --> 42:20.342
Then perhaps the press.

42:21.183 --> 42:25.141
I think not, sir.
They look, well, rather ordinary.

42:26.921 --> 42:29.048
-Constituents?
-Yes, sir.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.279
-Show them in.
-Yes, sir.

42:55.348 --> 42:58.749
-Quick, their names.
-Mr. Franklin. Mr. Jackson.

42:59.853 --> 43:01.320
-Right.
-Show them in.

43:01.388 --> 43:02.650
Yes, sir.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.783
Gentlemen.

43:08.528 --> 43:11.224
Brothers, brothers.

43:11.298 --> 43:14.096
I am so glad to see you.

43:14.167 --> 43:18.604
Mr. Jackson, how do you do?
And Mr. Franklin, I'm delighted to see you.

43:18.672 --> 43:23.040
-I'm Jackson, he's Franklin.
-I'm sorry about that.

43:23.375 --> 43:26.071
Brothers.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.976
Have a seat.

43:30.416 --> 43:32.509
-Now, then, Mr. Wilson--
-Jackson.

43:33.152 --> 43:36.918
Oh, yes, of course.
You see, I am so glad to see you.

43:37.089 --> 43:40.217
lt isn't often I'm privileged to see
our more common folk...

43:40.292 --> 43:42.988
the real salt-of-the-earth folk, you know.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.595
As I was just saying to my beloved wife...

43:45.664 --> 43:49.724
it is because of knowing the ordinary folk
in our daily lives...

43:49.801 --> 43:53.168
that we can keep in touch
with the pulse of the grassroots.

43:54.672 --> 43:58.438
Now, brothers, what can I do for you?

43:58.543 --> 43:59.805
We have this problem--

43:59.878 --> 44:03.473
Problem? Your problems
are my problems...

44:03.781 --> 44:07.478
and our problems are the problems
of all black people.

44:07.886 --> 44:10.821
-We were robbed, Congressman Lincoln.
-No.

44:12.056 --> 44:14.388
-Yes, at gunpoint.
-Gunpoint?

44:15.759 --> 44:16.919
What a shame.

44:22.065 --> 44:25.466
lt wasn't brothers, was it?

44:26.470 --> 44:30.770
They were wearing masks,
but we are sure they were black.

44:36.580 --> 44:37.911
My people.

44:41.285 --> 44:42.718
How long?

44:46.923 --> 44:49.756
Why do we do this to one another?

44:52.195 --> 44:56.131
-Now you were saying you were robbed.
-The other night.

44:56.799 --> 45:00.326
Our wallets, our jewelry...

45:00.836 --> 45:05.273
and some very valuable mementos
that we kept....

45:06.642 --> 45:08.007
Never fear.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.680
Just one simple phone call...

45:13.748 --> 45:17.343
to my good friend Lieutenant Hardcastle
down at police headquarters...

45:17.419 --> 45:20.820
ought to go a long way
in capturing this traitor to our race.

45:22.224 --> 45:25.091
Where did you say
this robbery took place?

45:25.160 --> 45:26.457
Madame Zenobia.

45:34.069 --> 45:36.902
-ls the line busy?
-Madame Zenobia?

45:36.972 --> 45:38.370
You know the place?

45:39.106 --> 45:40.198
Yes.

45:41.041 --> 45:42.338
That is...

45:43.577 --> 45:44.737
l've heard...

45:44.912 --> 45:47.710
of that illegal...

45:47.781 --> 45:49.612
after-hours club.

45:50.217 --> 45:51.878
A den of iniquity.

45:51.952 --> 45:56.252
Yes, a lot of hip people go by there,
people from all different sides of the track.

45:56.590 --> 45:59.115
lrresponsible ingrates, brothers.

45:59.260 --> 46:03.060
You would be well advised not to venture
down that dark path.

46:03.397 --> 46:06.160
Just last week,
I was saying to my beloved wife...

46:06.232 --> 46:10.498
that I would not be caught dead
in such a place.

46:10.703 --> 46:13.433
Hi, how you doing today, sugar?

46:14.574 --> 46:18.135
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were in a conference.

46:22.382 --> 46:25.317
Brother man, what's happening?

46:25.385 --> 46:27.114
-Peggy Leggy.
-No.

46:27.654 --> 46:30.646
Around here, folks call me Mrs. Lincoln.

46:33.492 --> 46:36.518
You know, in spite of
that whole rip-off thing...

46:36.762 --> 46:40.357
child, I had me a ball, I want to tell you!

46:40.699 --> 46:44.066
Peg, dear, must you always speak dialect?

46:44.136 --> 46:45.728
It's so condescending.

46:45.871 --> 46:48.669
We must rid ourselves
of these linguistic shackles.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.731
Honey, hush.

46:51.643 --> 46:55.443
You all have got to forgive my husband.
I love his sweet seIf to death...

46:55.514 --> 46:59.712
but ever since he got a bit of position,
he thinks he's into something.

47:00.052 --> 47:02.952
There was a time
when he still liked fried chicken.

47:03.788 --> 47:07.053
I get so tired
of going to them corny dances...

47:07.124 --> 47:09.752
corny dinners we keep getting invited to...

47:09.827 --> 47:12.728
where you be the token one
and everybody standing around...

47:12.797 --> 47:15.163
looking at you
like you something in the zoo.

47:15.232 --> 47:17.063
I got tired!

47:17.468 --> 47:20.869
About six months ago,
I got old Super Black over here...

47:20.938 --> 47:23.270
to take me to where my folks is.

47:23.574 --> 47:27.135
I figure he'd take me to a dinner,
take me dancing or something...

47:27.311 --> 47:30.438
and, child, he come taking me
to Zenobia's.

47:30.814 --> 47:35.046
He knew all the bouncers,
all the waitresses by their first names...

47:35.118 --> 47:38.110
and come to find out,
he a charter member!

47:40.190 --> 47:42.181
Damn near blew my mind.

47:42.592 --> 47:45.117
This nigger's something else, honey.

47:46.429 --> 47:49.455
You see, I discovered
that a great number of my constituents....

47:49.532 --> 47:53.059
Honey, that ain't nothing
for you to be ashamed of.

47:53.436 --> 47:56.029
Them politicians
you be hanging out with in Washington...

47:56.105 --> 47:59.404
be getting into their pleasures
a whole lot worse of ways than that.

47:59.475 --> 48:00.703
Right, brothers?

48:00.776 --> 48:03.677
How can one work
for the good of one's people...

48:03.746 --> 48:07.546
if one's wife continually airs in public
one's dirty laundry?

48:07.716 --> 48:12.119
The phrase is
"putting one's business in the street."

48:14.390 --> 48:16.153
You see what I mean?

48:17.059 --> 48:19.994
So, what brings
you all around here visiting?

48:21.663 --> 48:23.960
We're trying to get some help...

48:24.866 --> 48:26.731
to track down them stick-up fellas...

48:26.801 --> 48:29.998
'cause we lost some very valuable
property the other night.

48:31.439 --> 48:32.838
I'm sorry to hear that.

48:34.108 --> 48:37.600
And them niggers
interrupted the best roll...

48:37.678 --> 48:39.646
I ever had!

48:41.783 --> 48:46.413
Listen, there's a big-time hood named
Geechie Dan Beauford you should see.

48:46.487 --> 48:50.684
Also, get a rundown on a local hustler
named Little Seymour.

48:50.757 --> 48:54.488
Personally, I think Seymour
is the one who done it, but be careful.

48:54.561 --> 48:58.964
<i>Little Seymour travels with a bodyguard</i>
<i>named Big Percy, who can get real ugly.</i>

48:59.032 --> 49:01.830
-You sure this is the place?
-Yes, I'm sure.

49:01.902 --> 49:06.032
All we got to do is go inside,
see this Little Seymour...

49:06.106 --> 49:08.267
and ask him about our property.
Now, come on.

49:29.462 --> 49:32.295
-You see what I saw?
-Yes, I saw what you saw...

49:32.364 --> 49:33.763
and don't worry about nothing...

49:33.833 --> 49:36.063
because the dude mess with me,
I'll knock him out.

49:36.135 --> 49:39.195
You know why?
Because I'm from off the corners.

49:39.405 --> 49:40.872
Now, come on.

49:54.219 --> 49:58.315
You just let some cat look funny at me
and see if I ain't on his case.

49:58.389 --> 49:59.788
That's right!

49:59.858 --> 50:03.021
Because my money
is in this place someplace, too.

50:03.428 --> 50:06.795
That's right, and where my money
is concerned, I don't play.

50:07.765 --> 50:10.563
I get mean when you mess with my green.

50:11.503 --> 50:13.595
Now, you see if I'm kidding.

50:22.813 --> 50:24.075
Say, man.

50:26.550 --> 50:28.017
Say, brother.

50:28.585 --> 50:31.349
-Say, I'm talking to you, man.
-What you want?

50:31.488 --> 50:33.285
You seen Big Percy around here?

50:33.357 --> 50:36.884
-Who wants to know?
-I'm asking the questions, sissy.

50:36.960 --> 50:38.222
Sissy!

50:46.869 --> 50:50.896
-I asked you a question, chump!
-He ain't here.

50:50.973 --> 50:53.498
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

50:55.645 --> 50:58.978
You dig it? You knock a dude down,
you get some respect.

51:02.251 --> 51:03.479
Come on.

51:09.691 --> 51:12.660
Yeah. Now, you understand
what I'm talking about?

51:13.028 --> 51:15.656
That's the only way to do it.
The American way.

51:15.730 --> 51:19.188
You understand that?
Now, the dude said that Big Percy...

51:19.434 --> 51:24.201
Little Seymour's bodyguard, ain't here.
So let's go get Little Seymour!

51:25.674 --> 51:28.370
-You understand? Go ahead.
-Let's get him.

51:29.844 --> 51:31.937
Now listen here, you all...

51:33.181 --> 51:34.842
I'm looking for...

51:35.350 --> 51:38.250
a corny little runt
named Seymour Petigreau.

51:43.791 --> 51:46.851
I know you're in here, Seymour,
so come on out!

51:49.663 --> 51:51.460
I hear you're so ugly...

51:51.665 --> 51:54.998
till the sun refuse to shine
every time you come out.

51:59.406 --> 52:01.397
You're so ugly...

52:02.543 --> 52:05.841
till it's against the law in 20 states
to marry you.

52:07.714 --> 52:09.739
Yeah, that's it, Steve. You're cooking.

52:09.816 --> 52:11.977
You keep on talking.
He's in here somewhere...

52:12.051 --> 52:14.519
and just remember, I got your back.

52:14.587 --> 52:17.454
And dig, say something about his mama.

52:17.523 --> 52:19.013
-Gotcha.
-That'll get him.

52:22.061 --> 52:24.325
I hear your breath's so bad...

52:24.397 --> 52:28.094
till you put the three leading toothpastes
out of business.

52:34.039 --> 52:36.371
Seymour Petigreau....

52:37.242 --> 52:38.504
Come out!

52:42.047 --> 52:43.776
I'm Little Seymour.

52:59.530 --> 53:01.157
And I'm Big Percy.

53:46.609 --> 53:48.440
What do you turkeys want?

54:20.242 --> 54:23.870
Mr. Seymour, I just got out the hospital.

54:24.645 --> 54:26.670
I was in the war. Veteran.

54:27.415 --> 54:29.576
See, I mean, every once in a while...

54:30.785 --> 54:33.379
I have these fits, you know.

54:33.454 --> 54:37.151
And the fits are....
I mean, I be jumping bad...

54:37.225 --> 54:40.251
and trying to make an impression
on people.

54:40.328 --> 54:43.786
But it's them fits that's doing it.
But then, every once in a while...

54:43.865 --> 54:48.199
they just go down
and then I be myseIf again...

54:48.269 --> 54:49.792
and I don't be jumping bad.

54:49.870 --> 54:52.361
But it's not my fault, Mr. Seymour.

54:52.439 --> 54:55.169
But I'm not reaching for a gun. I got a card.

54:55.242 --> 54:59.440
See, the card says, "If in case of a fit...

54:59.513 --> 55:03.643
"please put this man unharmed in a cab
and send him home to his wife.

55:03.717 --> 55:05.412
"She pay the bill."

55:06.052 --> 55:09.283
So I didn't want you
to get the wrong impression.

55:10.123 --> 55:13.889
You loud-talked me.
Nobody loud-talks Little Seymour.

55:14.594 --> 55:18.051
See, Mr. Seymour, that's.... See, I didn't....

55:18.130 --> 55:20.030
He's the one who loud-talked you.

55:20.099 --> 55:24.001
But, first of all, you got to understand
about his grandmother.

55:24.670 --> 55:28.037
His grandmother brought up him...

55:28.340 --> 55:30.035
and his sisters.

55:30.109 --> 55:34.842
Ever since they was down there
picking cotton, Mr. Seymour.

55:34.914 --> 55:37.781
I know you can identify
with picking cotton.

55:39.318 --> 55:41.513
If you can't, then I can dig that.

55:41.587 --> 55:46.489
But anyway, see, what happens
is the grandmother's an old lady, you dig?

55:46.558 --> 55:50.221
And so his sister's been keeping
life savings on her...

55:50.295 --> 55:54.493
because she don't trust the bank too deep.
Banks are ripping people off and stuff.

55:54.566 --> 55:58.058
And then she went to Zenobia's, you dig?
And in Zenobia's...

56:00.104 --> 56:03.039
was robbed of the money.

56:03.408 --> 56:05.706
And the life savings just went.

56:06.411 --> 56:09.141
So my man said,
"Let's go check out Mr. Seymour."

56:09.214 --> 56:13.582
Because you're highly thought of
in our community, you dig?

56:13.650 --> 56:17.984
I mean, you're even bigger
than Geechie Dan Beauford, you dig?

56:20.791 --> 56:23.225
Anyway he's desperate to talk to you.

56:23.293 --> 56:25.818
That's why he's calling you
all them names.

56:25.896 --> 56:30.333
But if you notice, Mr. Seymour,
he never said nothing about your mother.

56:34.204 --> 56:36.934
So he wasn't that desperate, you see?

56:38.308 --> 56:41.606
Steve, come over here
and apologize to Mr. Seymour.

56:41.677 --> 56:45.272
This is my friend, Steve,
who's going to apologize to you.

56:46.148 --> 56:48.446
Let's get a few things straight.

56:48.818 --> 56:52.117
First, whoever hit Zenobia
is going to pay for it...

56:52.188 --> 56:55.021
with the skin off their tail
when I find out who it is...

56:55.091 --> 56:56.820
because me and her is tight.

56:56.893 --> 57:01.330
And second, that story
you just told me is bullshit.

57:01.898 --> 57:03.195
Yes, sir.

57:03.799 --> 57:05.232
And third...

57:06.068 --> 57:10.197
here's a little something
for niggers who loud-talk Little Seymour.

57:40.200 --> 57:41.633
-Hi, girl.
-Hi, Irma.

57:41.702 --> 57:43.966
-Where are they?
-ln there, child.

57:50.544 --> 57:53.479
-What are we gonna do with these fools?
-I don't know.

57:53.547 --> 57:58.109
No, wait a minute. See, because
first of all, that was the hardest-hitting...

57:58.419 --> 58:02.411
fastest, baddest little black man
of colored descent...

58:02.488 --> 58:04.012
I have ever seen in my life.

58:04.090 --> 58:06.957
-But I had him on the run, didn't l?
-Didn't you?

58:07.026 --> 58:11.292
-Did he hit me with his foot or his hand?
-Both of them, at the same time.

58:11.364 --> 58:12.729
Wardell, honey.

58:12.799 --> 58:15.927
Your imagination's going to get you killed
one of these days.

58:16.002 --> 58:19.267
Now, get up and let me take you home
and try to patch you up.

58:19.339 --> 58:20.806
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

58:20.873 --> 58:25.207
Don't forget, tomorrow we going after
big-time Geechie Dan Beauford.

58:25.278 --> 58:26.745
You got it.

01:00:12.548 --> 01:00:14.880
I'm here to see Mr. Geechie Dan.

01:00:22.757 --> 01:00:24.088
Wait here.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.593
22 <i>%</i> . I want to know how you feel--

01:00:28.663 --> 01:00:31.029
A man's here to see you, boss.

01:00:34.435 --> 01:00:37.029
Bring him over here and sit him down.

01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:50.578
Sit down.

01:01:54.746 --> 01:01:56.611
Now, what do you want?

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:02.052
Sir, see, it's like this.

01:02:03.922 --> 01:02:06.447
Some property of mine was stolen...

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:08.921
and I need some help.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:12.288
So what you coming to me for?

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:18.668
I heard that don't nothing go down
unless you know about it.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.138
Man, get out of my face.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:25.770
No. Just a minute, Geechie Dan.

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:28.110
Mr. Beauford.

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:32.607
If you don't get away from here soon...

01:02:32.683 --> 01:02:36.482
they are going to be picking up your head
from across the street.

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:38.916
Now move out, sucker.

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:45.492
Wait one minute. Don't be pulling....
Mr. Beauford, please, sir. Please.

01:03:57.564 --> 01:03:58.758
Move it!

01:05:05.996 --> 01:05:09.454
All right, let's start all over again.

01:05:10.101 --> 01:05:12.729
-You all going to tell me something.
-What?

01:05:12.803 --> 01:05:16.068
-Anything I want to know.
-We don't know nothing.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.540
Somebody hired you to finger me...

01:05:18.609 --> 01:05:22.044
-and I want to know who.
-Nobody hired us to do nothing.

01:05:22.112 --> 01:05:25.309
I just came to you
because I was looking for help.

01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:29.011
-You're a lying dog, sucker.
-No. I ain't. We told you...

01:05:29.085 --> 01:05:32.248
-we don't know nothing about them guns--
-Nigger!

01:05:36.459 --> 01:05:38.359
And you, too, hot lips.

01:05:40.397 --> 01:05:41.728
I'll talk!

01:05:49.038 --> 01:05:51.699
If we talk, are you going to let us go?

01:05:56.278 --> 01:05:58.405
How we know you ain't lying?

01:06:00.182 --> 01:06:02.878
First off, I don't want you.

01:06:03.552 --> 01:06:06.214
I want your boss. And second...

01:06:07.222 --> 01:06:08.587
I like you.

01:06:08.957 --> 01:06:10.356
And third...

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:13.190
if you all don't tell me everything
I want to know...

01:06:13.262 --> 01:06:16.163
we gonna beat
all the black off both of you.

01:06:17.398 --> 01:06:20.834
-What you want to know?
-Silky Slim sent you, didn't he?

01:06:25.339 --> 01:06:28.399
He wants to control all my territory,
don't he?

01:06:31.913 --> 01:06:33.778
That's what I figured.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:37.843
You all take these two dogs somewhere,
put them to sleep.

01:06:38.252 --> 01:06:42.655
-You said you was going to let us go.
-You just confessed, turkey.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.554
-Your ass is grass.
-No.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.151
I can prove who we are.

01:06:50.197 --> 01:06:54.395
There's my stub from my paycheck.
My name's on it.

01:06:55.068 --> 01:06:56.296
My name.

01:06:59.105 --> 01:07:01.573
My bowling club lD, see?

01:07:08.582 --> 01:07:10.982
So you are only finger men? So what?

01:07:11.184 --> 01:07:13.583
You know too much. Get them out of here.

01:07:57.428 --> 01:08:00.556
-Why don't we hit Slim?
-I thought about it...

01:08:01.799 --> 01:08:05.860
-but he's hard as hell to get.
-Anyone can be gotten to.

01:08:15.546 --> 01:08:17.138
It's funny, man.

01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:21.339
One day, I'm on top of the world.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.649
And now this thing with Silky Slim.

01:08:27.491 --> 01:08:29.118
He must be crazy!

01:08:29.426 --> 01:08:32.827
Think I'll let him move in on my territory
and do nothing about it?

01:08:32.895 --> 01:08:34.988
-Right.
-Who does he think he is?

01:08:35.064 --> 01:08:37.555
-He's messing with Geechie Dan Beauford!
-Right.

01:08:37.633 --> 01:08:39.430
I will kill the punk!

01:08:39.635 --> 01:08:43.093
Trying to off me. I will murder the sucker!

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.752
Okay, Geechie...

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:10.093
that was your short!

01:09:11.066 --> 01:09:13.033
Next time it's going to be your life!

01:09:13.201 --> 01:09:17.001
-You got a life, too, Silky Slim !
-I'm giving you two minutes.

01:09:18.607 --> 01:09:20.404
We make a deal now...

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:23.009
or you're going to be wearing wings.

01:09:23.178 --> 01:09:26.613
-Take your best shot! No deal!
-Come on, man.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:31.142
-Let's be reasonable.
-Ain't nothing to be reasonable about.

01:09:31.952 --> 01:09:33.350
Look, Geechie...

01:09:34.455 --> 01:09:36.479
I said let's talk, my man.

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:42.027
You team up with me
and we rule this town from river to river.

01:09:42.962 --> 01:09:45.693
Never will so few
owe so much to so many.

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:55.136
-That's the one! He's the one we're after.
-Shut up over there!

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:58.374
But he's the one
who robbed Madame Zenobia's.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:09:59.502
So what?

01:09:59.579 --> 01:10:02.776
But he stole something that night.
Something he don't know about...

01:10:02.849 --> 01:10:04.817
something that's worth a lot of money.

01:10:04.884 --> 01:10:06.613
I told you, shut up over there.

01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:10.383
Don't bug me with this penny ante crap
at a time like this.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:14.290
-You've got one minute, Geechie.
-But this ain't no penny ante.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.625
It's worth a fortune.

01:10:17.697 --> 01:10:19.961
We'll share it with you, Mr. Geechie Dan.

01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:23.469
-You know how much it's worth?
-$300,000.

01:10:27.039 --> 01:10:30.338
-What'd you say?
-$300,000 in diamonds.

01:10:30.876 --> 01:10:31.968
Slim?

01:10:33.345 --> 01:10:36.178
$300,000?

01:10:36.248 --> 01:10:37.408
ln diamonds?

01:10:37.549 --> 01:10:40.541
Yeah, but he don't know nothing
about it, see?

01:10:46.358 --> 01:10:49.054
How you know
they knocked off Zenobia's?

01:10:49.294 --> 01:10:52.729
Go on, talk fast, turkey,
or I'll put a hole through your eyes.

01:10:52.797 --> 01:10:55.391
'Cause that's what he said
when he robbed the place.

01:10:55.466 --> 01:10:59.061
He said, "Never have so few
owed so much to so many."

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:02.569
You see?
And he had a mask on at the time...

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.505
but we recognize his voice.

01:11:04.575 --> 01:11:08.033
-Yeah. He's the one.
-What about the diamonds?

01:11:08.879 --> 01:11:12.975
-Your time's up, Geechie.
-Give me a couple of minutes, Slim.

01:11:13.284 --> 01:11:15.684
I'm talking it over with my boys.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.049
One minute, my man.

01:11:18.389 --> 01:11:19.787
Go on. Talk.

01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:25.525
Me and my man,
we was going to Madame Zenobia's.

01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:28.428
And we was behind
these two African gentlemen...

01:11:28.498 --> 01:11:30.159
who was going in there.

01:11:30.233 --> 01:11:33.396
First, see, the doorman,
he wouldn't let them in.

01:11:33.636 --> 01:11:37.402
Then they showed him a letter
from their lawyer...

01:11:37.474 --> 01:11:41.410
that said they were very important people
in the diamond business.

01:11:41.478 --> 01:11:45.676
So the doorman apologized to them
and he let them in.

01:11:47.282 --> 01:11:52.219
Later on that evening, I was in the john.
I was relieving myself.

01:11:52.588 --> 01:11:56.354
And the two Africans
came into the bathroom.

01:11:57.126 --> 01:12:00.857
Now, they didn't know I was in there
because I was sitting on the john.

01:12:00.929 --> 01:12:03.329
And one of them, I heard him say:

01:12:05.267 --> 01:12:08.327
"What did you do with the diamonds?"

01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:12.234
So the other one said,
"They're in my lawyer's office.

01:12:12.307 --> 01:12:14.332
"They'll be safe there
for the next 10 days...

01:12:14.409 --> 01:12:16.342
"till we get back from Washington.

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:19.811
"And then the buyer will come in
from California."

01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:21.812
The other African said:

01:12:21.883 --> 01:12:25.250
"How much you think
we going to get for these stones?"

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.385
So the other one said:

01:12:27.455 --> 01:12:29.787
"$300,000."

01:12:30.525 --> 01:12:32.220
So they left...

01:12:32.527 --> 01:12:35.291
and I came running out
to talk to my man...

01:12:35.363 --> 01:12:39.527
about getting to the lawyer's office
to hit the place and get them diamonds.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.296
That's when Silky Slim come in
and held everybody up...

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:47.932
and took the wallets and the money,
and along with it, the lawyer's letter...

01:12:48.008 --> 01:12:50.909
with the address
of where the diamonds is.

01:12:54.047 --> 01:12:56.709
So that's why you've been sniffing around.

01:12:56.783 --> 01:12:59.479
-To help you find the letter.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:01.421 --> 01:13:03.616
Of course, if you're lying...

01:13:03.924 --> 01:13:06.484
the undertaker's going to visit
your relatives.

01:13:06.893 --> 01:13:09.690
Okay, Geechie, let me hear it.

01:13:13.866 --> 01:13:15.197
All right!

01:13:18.504 --> 01:13:20.734
We can make some kind of deal.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.905
-Come on in.
-Good.

01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:27.606
Everybody keep their hands
where we can see them.

01:13:33.853 --> 01:13:37.050
Make sure you come through that door
the same way.

01:13:37.822 --> 01:13:39.483
No, put them away.

01:14:48.891 --> 01:14:50.085
My man.

01:14:53.296 --> 01:14:54.923
What's happening?

01:14:56.432 --> 01:15:00.333
Down to business, Slim.
I don't like your bag.

01:15:02.003 --> 01:15:03.766
You got no class.

01:15:04.306 --> 01:15:07.036
Drug dealing, prostitution...

01:15:07.642 --> 01:15:11.271
vulgar stickups like Madame Zenobia's
last Saturday night.

01:15:11.413 --> 01:15:15.213
-That ain't my thing.
-I was home in bed last Saturday night.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.519
No skin off me, man, so let's move on.

01:15:24.059 --> 01:15:27.960
Now I got something
we can work on together.

01:15:28.996 --> 01:15:32.591
It's a $300,000 proposition.

01:15:35.002 --> 01:15:37.664
-I'm interested.
-Fifty-fifty.

01:15:38.472 --> 01:15:41.964
And if we wrap it up,
then we can talk maybe...

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:45.534
about some togetherness
on a permanent basis.

01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:47.605
What's the deal?

01:15:48.949 --> 01:15:53.283
You left Zenobia's the other night
loaded down with personal effects...

01:15:54.088 --> 01:15:57.955
among which is a document
that will lead us to the $300,000.

01:15:58.958 --> 01:16:00.152
It's a simple document.

01:16:00.226 --> 01:16:04.424
lt ain't got no meaning
until I tell you what it connects up with...

01:16:04.497 --> 01:16:06.362
and I ain't going to tell you...

01:16:06.432 --> 01:16:10.732
until you bring back every bit
of the personal property you lifted.

01:16:14.273 --> 01:16:17.436
You won't figure it out
in a million years, Slim.

01:16:19.178 --> 01:16:22.908
-How do I know you ain't running a game?
-My word is my rep.

01:16:26.084 --> 01:16:29.713
But, of course, if you didn't hit
Madame Zenobia's last Saturday night...

01:16:29.788 --> 01:16:32.655
then the whole thing is academic.

01:16:46.004 --> 01:16:47.528
You got a deal.

01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:50.337
Good.

01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:02.781
We'll meet in a neutral place.

01:17:03.854 --> 01:17:07.756
I'll let you know where,
when I call you and tell you what time.

01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:12.793
I'll be there with three of my boys,
and you show up with three of yours.

01:17:15.299 --> 01:17:18.199
-Look to see you around.
-You will.

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:24.005
Order me a new car.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:29.300
That is if you want to be comfortable
riding around in your own.

01:20:48.371 --> 01:20:51.272
Amen! Truly wonderful.

01:21:06.788 --> 01:21:09.484
We got to thank our choir.

01:21:09.557 --> 01:21:13.550
Sister Louise, you are certainly
in rare form tonight.

01:21:13.762 --> 01:21:15.354
Mr. Geechie Dan?

01:21:16.665 --> 01:21:20.032
My wallet is in that bag
Mr. Silky Slim's got on his lap there.

01:21:20.101 --> 01:21:22.399
And please, sir, may I have it?

01:21:23.872 --> 01:21:27.204
This thing go all right, boy,
you can buy yourseIf a dozen wallets...

01:21:27.274 --> 01:21:28.901
and fill them all with $100 bills.

01:21:28.976 --> 01:21:32.343
That one has family mementos.
If it's all the same to you--

01:21:33.147 --> 01:21:36.480
Now, before we leave
on our annual picnic...

01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:39.446
I'd like to bring to your attention....

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.488
We're going on this picnic.

01:21:41.955 --> 01:21:46.085
That way if anything happens,
we got the perfect alibi.

01:21:46.226 --> 01:21:50.060
And the saying that comes back
into my mind from that war...

01:21:50.264 --> 01:21:53.357
was, "Loose lips sink ships."

01:21:54.534 --> 01:21:56.764
Said that, Second World War...

01:21:57.070 --> 01:22:00.005
'cause they wanted people
to keep their mouths shut...

01:22:00.073 --> 01:22:01.597
and listen a little more.

01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:04.870
Loose lips sink ships!

01:22:05.611 --> 01:22:09.570
And the looser the lips are,
the faster the ship sinks.

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:12.744
And some of the lips
in this congregation...

01:22:12.819 --> 01:22:14.946
done sunk aircraft carriers.

01:22:15.922 --> 01:22:17.651
Friends, I say to you tonight...

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:22.217
if we were as fast on the hip
as we are on the lip...

01:22:22.828 --> 01:22:24.819
we'd have a bigger church here.

01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:26.386
Better know it.

01:22:26.465 --> 01:22:29.628
Let me tell you about some of the people
in this congregation.

01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:31.225
You know what they're doing?

01:22:31.303 --> 01:22:34.363
A lot of the people in this church
have been going around...

01:22:34.439 --> 01:22:38.808
spreading falsehoods, lies, and rumors,
trying to ruin the reputation...

01:22:38.877 --> 01:22:41.539
of a lot of other people in this church.

01:22:41.613 --> 01:22:44.673
They go around trying to rock
somebody else's cradle...

01:22:45.384 --> 01:22:48.284
trying to get a piece
of somebody else's pie.

01:22:48.352 --> 01:22:51.651
Trying to covet somebody else's mate
for their own.

01:22:53.157 --> 01:22:54.522
Amen.

01:22:54.692 --> 01:22:55.920
Loose lips...

01:22:55.993 --> 01:22:59.554
friends put in motion
by lechery and sinful thought...

01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:01.996
is sinking some of the great ships
of marriage.

01:23:02.066 --> 01:23:04.091
They are going down on the rocks.

01:23:04.168 --> 01:23:06.864
That's what they are doing. Sinking!

01:23:09.039 --> 01:23:10.131
Amen.

01:23:11.108 --> 01:23:14.168
'Cause lips won't shut up...

01:23:14.412 --> 01:23:17.574
and help the buoyancy
keep them floating...

01:23:17.647 --> 01:23:20.445
across the top of the river of happiness.

01:23:22.118 --> 01:23:25.110
You all know I'm talking
about the loose lips...

01:23:25.188 --> 01:23:28.157
that go around kissing on lips
that don't belong to them.

01:23:28.224 --> 01:23:30.089
That go around lying on folks...

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.620
that make young girls make promises
they know their bodies can't stand.

01:23:34.697 --> 01:23:37.188
That's the kind of lips I'm talking about.

01:23:38.568 --> 01:23:42.766
We got to learn to control them lips,
tighten up them ears a little tighter!

01:23:42.838 --> 01:23:47.434
We got to learn to call on the Lord
and ask him to teach us some discipline!

01:23:48.444 --> 01:23:51.902
Remember, children,
loose lips are everywhere.

01:23:52.581 --> 01:23:56.677
There's no one place you can go
and all the lips are there.

01:23:57.286 --> 01:24:02.223
Loose lips move around.
Loose lips are among you in the pews.

01:24:03.025 --> 01:24:05.118
They're among you in the choir.

01:24:05.194 --> 01:24:06.684
-Amen.
-Yes, sir.

01:24:06.762 --> 01:24:09.390
There are loose lips among the deacons.

01:24:09.465 --> 01:24:12.922
Certain things got out about a meeting
we had here last Tuesday night...

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.195
that nobody should have known!

01:24:15.269 --> 01:24:17.430
Had to be among the deacons.

01:24:17.505 --> 01:24:20.440
It's among the children
in the Sunday school...

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:22.736
saying, "l ain't going to put in this money.

01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:25.210
"I'm going to spend it on candy."

01:24:26.047 --> 01:24:28.982
I done heard so many bad things
about so many of you all...

01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:31.541
till I wept with sadness last night.

01:24:31.619 --> 01:24:34.053
Last night my heart hung heavy, friends.

01:24:34.121 --> 01:24:37.386
I felt so bad,
I almost went out and bought a bottle.

01:24:38.558 --> 01:24:40.753
Watch out there, now. Watch out there.

01:24:40.827 --> 01:24:43.421
Friends, I fought temptation...

01:24:43.697 --> 01:24:45.927
and that's what we gonna
have to learn to do.

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:49.992
When we get the temptation
to let our loose lips loose, fight it!

01:24:50.504 --> 01:24:52.972
We got to learn to get off the wrong foot...

01:24:53.039 --> 01:24:56.133
and step out on the good foot. Feel good.

01:24:56.209 --> 01:25:00.270
When you feel good, you look good,
and you want to do good things.

01:25:00.447 --> 01:25:04.781
You want to make other people happy
'cause it makes you happy yourself.

01:25:04.951 --> 01:25:08.909
Friends, we need more romance
and less hot pants.

01:25:08.988 --> 01:25:10.751
Come on with it now.

01:25:10.956 --> 01:25:13.288
Run some water on the hot pants.

01:25:13.526 --> 01:25:17.792
Put your sprinkler on and run through,
you want to cool your hot pants off.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:21.230
We need more midnight sleeping
and less midnight creeping.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.234
Yeah. Lay it on us.

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:26.034
Help us, Lord! Help us!

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:27.900
Somebody got to do something!

01:25:27.973 --> 01:25:30.999
-Can I get an amen?
-Amen!

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:32.441
Let's stand here, brother...

01:25:32.511 --> 01:25:35.206
as we get ready to dismiss ourselves
for our picnic.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.740
-Can I get one more amen for the Lord?
-Amen!

01:25:40.018 --> 01:25:42.009
Truly wonderful, brother!

01:25:51.796 --> 01:25:53.491
I want you to call your boss...

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.830
and tell him his office
is gonna be burglarized this afternoon...

01:25:56.901 --> 01:25:59.165
and have the police stake it out, all right?

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:01.864
-But--
-Just do what I asked you to do.

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:32.358
Something's come up, baby.

01:26:32.735 --> 01:26:35.363
I got to be out of the city for a few hours.

01:26:35.438 --> 01:26:38.236
Keep everything warm. I'll see you later.

01:26:43.879 --> 01:26:45.608
-What it is.
-Move it.

01:28:15.368 --> 01:28:16.596
No good.

01:28:19.438 --> 01:28:22.965
Maybe we could get into the trunk
through the back seat.

01:28:26.311 --> 01:28:29.644
<i>All right, you young ones,</i>
<i>baseball game is about to start!</i>

01:28:29.715 --> 01:28:32.081
<i>Everybody on the field. Come on now!</i>

01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:35.984
<i>Baseball game is about to start.</i>
<i>All you players on the field.</i>

01:28:51.102 --> 01:28:55.835
Man, I ain't had this much fun
since I was in reform school.

01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.034
-Yeah? Which one was you in?
-Waterbury.

01:28:59.343 --> 01:29:03.143
No, I was in Charlottetown. Watch this.

01:29:03.581 --> 01:29:05.446
I'm going to steal second on you turkeys.

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.408
Try it.

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:23.892
See if you can get me a chisel
and a hammer.

01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:25.798
-A what?
-A chisel and a hammer.

01:29:25.869 --> 01:29:30.101
-Where am I going to get a chisel?
-Look in the toolbox of the bus, dodo.

01:29:55.063 --> 01:29:56.758
<i>Come and get it!</i>

01:30:41.875 --> 01:30:44.810
You know,
I had such a time dancing with you.

01:30:45.912 --> 01:30:48.107
You're a dainty little thing.

01:30:48.348 --> 01:30:52.307
I'd like to take you
to Geechie Dan's place...

01:30:52.385 --> 01:30:54.615
and have a time. Yes, I would.

01:30:57.457 --> 01:30:59.220
Don't you think it's time you told me...

01:30:59.292 --> 01:31:02.193
about what's going on
with your new friends?

01:31:03.262 --> 01:31:05.628
We're just working with them
to get the ticket.

01:31:05.698 --> 01:31:08.360
-Steve.
-Now, don't worry.

01:31:09.969 --> 01:31:13.598
We're closer to that ticket
than you realize. Don't worry.

01:31:13.873 --> 01:31:15.636
Okay, if you say so.

01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:22.941
I better go get the girls ready
for the African ceremonial pageant.

01:31:27.186 --> 01:31:29.950
Give me a kiss. Come on, give me a kiss.

01:31:44.602 --> 01:31:45.762
Hello.

01:31:46.671 --> 01:31:48.571
Baby, what's happening?

01:31:49.841 --> 01:31:51.103
Sure, I can talk.

01:31:55.613 --> 01:31:57.581
All right, girl. Split.

01:32:02.386 --> 01:32:04.547
No. You stay right where you are.

01:32:04.621 --> 01:32:07.249
No. I'll get back to you later. Hang up now.

01:32:07.324 --> 01:32:09.189
I'll be a son of a....

01:32:10.594 --> 01:32:14.394
-Everything's gone wrong.
-They didn't get the diamonds.

01:32:14.464 --> 01:32:17.433
Not only didn't get them,
but they got busted...

01:32:17.501 --> 01:32:20.026
all of them, and one of them talked!

01:32:20.771 --> 01:32:24.605
No. Not my boys. They don't talk.

01:32:24.808 --> 01:32:28.106
Mine neither, but somebody did...

01:32:29.278 --> 01:32:31.838
'cause the cops is looking for me and you.

01:32:31.914 --> 01:32:35.577
They busted into my apartment
with a warrant for both of us!

01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:37.551
Then somebody did talk.

01:32:38.187 --> 01:32:42.556
I think you and me better get out of here
so we can kind of talk this thing over.

01:32:42.858 --> 01:32:44.223
Let's roll.

01:32:46.996 --> 01:32:50.056
-Mr. Silky Slim--
-Out of my way, fool!

01:32:53.369 --> 01:32:56.462
We could have been set up.
What about these two?

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.470
Maybe we were set up.

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:03.743
Rock gonna check you out good...

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:08.545
and if you ain't clean, I'll come on
back here and pick up your liver.

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:13.049
-Now move out of there, sucker.
-Get that heap out of there.

01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:15.419
Boss, look! Trouble!

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:27.128
-Let's get the hell out of here.
-There's only one road out, and that's it!

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:30.932
-We've got to think of something fast.
-You better think of something fast.

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:35.305
-This whole dumb-ass trip was your idea !
-Hang on to your cool, sucker.

01:33:36.643 --> 01:33:41.012
There's got to be something.
There's got to be a way out.

01:34:04.837 --> 01:34:07.135
Officer Lewis, what's going on?

01:34:11.744 --> 01:34:15.975
We have a warrant for the arrest of one
Nickademus Williams, alias Silky Slim...

01:34:16.048 --> 01:34:19.415
and one Daniel Beauford,
alias Geechie Dan.

01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:23.853
We don't have anybody
in our congregation with names like them.

01:34:24.022 --> 01:34:27.685
Geechie Slim. Silky Dan. No.

01:34:28.193 --> 01:34:32.823
-You mind if we look around?
-No, sir, Officer. You go right ahead.

01:34:40.939 --> 01:34:42.839
-This Slim's car?
-Yeah.

01:34:42.908 --> 01:34:44.135
Open it.

01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:50.140
Just stay with me.

01:35:26.382 --> 01:35:27.406
Nothing here, sir.

01:35:40.562 --> 01:35:42.462
They're here someplace.

01:35:42.798 --> 01:35:46.256
All you got to do is point them out.
We'll do the rest.

01:36:33.381 --> 01:36:35.541
I'm gonna kill you.

01:36:37.184 --> 01:36:40.415
-Well?
-I can't, man. They'll murder me.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.421
I can't. They'll do me in.
You understand? I can't do it!

01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:45.617
Now, move! Get out of the way!

01:36:56.903 --> 01:36:59.997
Mr. Silky, wait! Mr. Silky.

01:37:03.309 --> 01:37:04.776
There they go!

01:37:32.003 --> 01:37:33.527
Hit the brakes.

01:38:45.408 --> 01:38:49.504
That sucker's going to get us killed.
You better get him off of there.

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.411
Door's stuck.

01:40:59.203 --> 01:41:01.637
Fool, you can't swim !

01:41:47.816 --> 01:41:50.785
-You all right, baby?
-I'm fine.

01:41:52.488 --> 01:41:54.979
I'm doing all right. How's Wardell?

01:41:55.424 --> 01:41:58.393
He's in another wing.
Irma's with him. He's okay.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.657
-And the ticket?
-It's safely hidden away at home.

01:42:05.733 --> 01:42:08.031
Sarah, we're on our way.

01:42:10.171 --> 01:42:14.232
Now, Sarah,
don't you cloud up on me, girl.

01:42:17.078 --> 01:42:21.276
Lookie here.
You got to go shopping for us.

01:42:21.616 --> 01:42:24.779
A backyard, a southern one.

01:42:26.087 --> 01:42:29.079
I know this restaurant across town,
seafood restaurant...

01:42:29.156 --> 01:42:31.783
where they got some of the best food
in the world...

01:42:31.858 --> 01:42:33.985
and live music and dancing.

01:42:34.928 --> 01:42:38.921
Now that we can afford it, we gonna
have to go out and do this town up right.

01:42:38.999 --> 01:42:42.025
I got my red dress...

01:42:42.302 --> 01:42:46.398
and my high-heeled sneakers
at home waiting, baby.

01:44:08.051 --> 01:44:09.484
<i>Amen!</i>
