00:03.503 --> 00:05.823
I believe in you, Liz.

00:08.983 --> 00:11.343
Stevens. Brawler's ready, let's go.

00:11.383 --> 00:14.063
Oh. I'll see you all tonight, then.
Wish me luck.

00:14.103 --> 00:16.143
We can't even be seen together!
It's over.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.463
I don't accept that.

00:17.503 --> 00:18.743
Good luck, Liz.

00:24.263 --> 00:26.383
Well, maybe that's it.
You never really trusted me.

00:26.423 --> 00:27.743
I'm just a bit of rough trade.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.063
Fuck off.

00:30.103 --> 00:32.543
I put it to you
that your entire statement

00:32.583 --> 00:33.863
is a work of fiction.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.343
Why did you lie?
Were you coerced into this?

00:36.943 --> 00:38.983
They're going to charge you
with perjury.

00:39.023 --> 00:41.703
It carries a maximum sentence
of 15 years.

00:42.623 --> 00:43.623
I gave you a chance.

00:46.303 --> 00:48.103
I can help you.

00:48.823 --> 00:50.423
Ferguson didn't kill him.

00:50.463 --> 00:51.543
What? Who did, then?

00:51.583 --> 00:54.183
I thought the answer was in here,
but it's not. It's outside

00:54.223 --> 00:56.343
and there's jack -
shit I can do about it.

00:56.383 --> 00:59.263
Today, justice has been served.

01:04.102 --> 01:11.143
There's no escaping
this place, is there?

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

02:23.103 --> 02:24.103
Oops, sorry.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.263
I'm getting a bit pissy here.

02:26.303 --> 02:32.783
That's OK.
It's a very brave thing you're doing.

02:44.343 --> 02:45.623
Do you want another glass?

02:45.663 --> 02:46.863
In a minute.

02:46.903 --> 02:48.463
I'm nearly finished.

02:52.263 --> 02:55.303
There. Done.
Wanna take a look?

02:55.343 --> 02:56.743
I don't think so.

02:56.783 --> 02:59.543
Just take a photo for Marion
and I'll send it to her.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.743
Cheer her up, poor love.

03:01.743 --> 03:03.543
Oh, my god.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.023
Your hair will grow back.

03:06.063 --> 03:09.503
And your sister will so appreciate
the solidarity, hmm?

03:11.623 --> 03:13.863
God, I wish I could do more.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.823
But the treatment
has chewed up all our savings.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.623
There's just nothing left.

03:18.663 --> 03:20.383
You want more money.

03:20.423 --> 03:21.863
Is that what you're saying?

03:21.903 --> 03:24.263
Well, we could certainly use it.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.423
You know, I've been
a very loyal friend to you.

03:28.303 --> 03:32.023
I've kept your secret
all these years.

03:32.063 --> 03:33.863
I'm not giving you another cent.

03:35.303 --> 03:36.623
But poor Marion.

03:36.663 --> 03:38.463
If poor Marion got a real job

03:38.503 --> 03:41.663
instead of trying
to write that ridiculous novel...

03:41.703 --> 03:43.983
Be careful.
I'll go to the...

03:49.703 --> 03:51.983
I don't respond well to blackmail.

03:58.263 --> 04:00.583
But I don't understand.

04:00.623 --> 04:03.983
What on earth possessed you
to give false testimony?

04:06.463 --> 04:08.183
I just wanted an early release.

04:12.263 --> 04:14.559
Well, you realise if you're
convicted of this perjury charge,

04:14.583 --> 04:16.463
you'll have extra time
added to your sentence?

04:17.863 --> 04:19.983
Oh, god, Liz!

04:22.583 --> 04:24.863
Alright, well,
you've only got yourself to blame.

04:26.983 --> 04:29.463
What if you say
the police made you do it?

04:29.503 --> 04:33.383
No. Nah, I can't do that, love.

04:33.423 --> 04:34.503
Why not?

04:34.543 --> 04:37.223
It wouldn't be the first time
they fitted someone up.

04:37.263 --> 04:38.743
This is my fault.

04:40.943 --> 04:42.463
I have to deal with it.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.383
Well, you'd better bloody hope
none of the others find out.

04:46.423 --> 04:49.583
Oh, fuck.

04:54.303 --> 04:57.543
Yeah, Sonia didn't do it
and now she's out.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.623
Pity we're
still stuck in here, but.

05:00.663 --> 05:02.823
I can't believe she got off.

05:02.863 --> 05:04.543
I mean, I always thought she did it.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.063
Well, you'd be wrong, then,
wouldn't ya?

05:07.103 --> 05:10.183
So much for that Witness X, eh?

05:10.223 --> 05:12.023
You don't think it was Maxie, do ya?

05:13.583 --> 05:15.063
No, Boomer.
Nuh.

05:15.103 --> 05:16.303
I don't.

05:16.343 --> 05:18.343
Who do you reckon it could have
been?

05:18.383 --> 05:19.783
Dunno.

05:19.823 --> 05:23.063
Biggest lagger ever.
Lagger and a liar.

05:23.103 --> 05:25.663
Hey, have you seen Franky
this morning?

05:25.703 --> 05:26.703
Nuh.

05:28.183 --> 05:30.343
They've set a date
for the committal hearing.

05:30.383 --> 05:32.783
God, that was quick. They're
not dicking around, are they?

05:32.823 --> 05:33.943
I'm sorry, Franky.

05:33.983 --> 05:36.143
I guess they think
their case is airtight.

05:36.183 --> 05:37.439
Look, I've been having
a think about

05:37.463 --> 05:40.543
who would possibly benefit
from Mike Pennisi's death.

05:40.583 --> 05:42.119
Now, he would have got
a huge compensation payout

05:42.143 --> 05:44.223
from that cooking show,
for his injuries.

05:44.263 --> 05:47.343
Yeah, well, I'm sure the agent would
have filed a claim on his behalf.

05:47.383 --> 05:49.463
So can you track that
and find out how much he got?

05:49.503 --> 05:50.759
Possibly, but I don't see
where you're go...

05:50.783 --> 05:52.759
There would be a beneficiary
of his will, and maybe

05:52.783 --> 05:53.879
that person didn't wanna wait...
Oh...

05:53.903 --> 05:54.959
till he died of natural causes.

05:54.983 --> 05:57.359
Franky, Franky, the police
would have gone over all of this.

05:57.383 --> 05:59.599
You're clutching at straws.
But you could check with probate

05:59.623 --> 06:01.119
and find out the names
of the beneficiaries

06:01.143 --> 06:02.503
and how much they got.

06:02.543 --> 06:04.719
We don't have the resources
for this, Franky, I'm sorry.

06:04.743 --> 06:06.023
Come on!

06:06.063 --> 06:07.599
There would have been someone
who stood to benefit

06:07.623 --> 06:09.383
from Mike Pennisi's death.

06:09.423 --> 06:12.423
You could at least offer
them an alternative suspect.

06:12.463 --> 06:17.463
Fuck.
I could do it myself!

06:17.503 --> 06:18.943
Hey.

06:18.983 --> 06:20.463
Hey.
What's up?

06:20.503 --> 06:21.919
Oh, the date for my committal's
been set.

06:21.943 --> 06:23.303
Sooner than I thought.

06:23.343 --> 06:26.343
Oh, shit.
Think the cops have a case?

06:26.383 --> 06:29.583
They're so sure I did it,
they're not looking for anyone else.

06:39.863 --> 06:42.039
No, I'm going to have to
get a lawyer, 'cause I cannot cop...

06:42.063 --> 06:43.103
Liz.

06:43.143 --> 06:44.863
Any extra time
on my sentence, Don.

06:44.903 --> 06:46.143
Liz.
It'd kill me.

06:46.183 --> 06:48.223
Liz, listen to me.
What?

06:48.263 --> 06:51.383
I can sort this with the DPP.
You don't need to get a lawyer.

06:51.423 --> 06:52.999
I just need a couple of days
to sort this.

06:53.023 --> 06:54.183
Yeah, well, what about Sonia?

06:54.223 --> 06:57.063
She's out there. She's free.
What if she comes after you?

06:57.103 --> 06:58.543
What's she gonna do?
Bite my ankles?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.743
Oh, Don, please, take it seriously.
OK, alright.

07:00.783 --> 07:02.943
She knows you had it in for her.

07:02.983 --> 07:04.503
Yeah, I know that but...
Yeah.

07:04.543 --> 07:07.023
I'm not scared of Sonia.
I'm not worried about Sonia.

07:07.063 --> 07:08.183
Oh, famous last words.

07:08.223 --> 07:10.383
I'm gonna put
a few things in motion.

07:10.423 --> 07:12.103
And we're gonna
get this sorted, OK?

07:12.143 --> 07:14.103
I'll be back here tomorrow
with an update.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.863
You don't need to panic.
Just hang in there.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.503
You've been so brave.
Just hang in there.

07:17.543 --> 07:19.543
We're nearly there.
Alright?

07:19.583 --> 07:22.143
Yeah.
I'm hangin'.

07:26.983 --> 07:28.503
Birdsworth.
Yeah?

07:28.543 --> 07:30.423
Got a message to pass on to you
from Stevens.

07:30.463 --> 07:31.503
Sonia?

07:31.543 --> 07:32.703
She copped a lucky break, eh?

07:32.743 --> 07:33.743
How ya goin'?

07:33.783 --> 07:35.983
She wants you to give her a call.
Here's her number.

07:40.383 --> 07:42.143
Put her on the call list.
You know the drill.

07:52.943 --> 07:55.383
Shit. Shit!

07:55.423 --> 07:56.623
What's the matter?

07:58.023 --> 07:59.263
Sonia.

07:59.303 --> 08:02.303
She wants me to call her.
She must know I'm Witness X.

08:02.343 --> 08:03.599
Hang on, how could she know that?

08:03.623 --> 08:05.199
Well, I don't know.
The cops must've leaked it.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.623
But why else
would she want to talk to me?

08:07.663 --> 08:09.663
Plenty of reasons.

08:09.703 --> 08:11.623
She thought you were
her best friend.

08:11.663 --> 08:14.343
Yeah, and we know what she does
to them.

08:14.383 --> 08:15.863
You've gotta make the call.

08:15.903 --> 08:17.583
Are you nuts?
Nuh.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.623
'Cause if you don't call,
she'll wonder why,

08:19.663 --> 08:21.303
and then she might figure it out.

09:06.183 --> 09:08.783
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

09:08.823 --> 09:11.263
All women to report
to assigned work duties,

09:11.303 --> 09:14.263
all women to report
to assigned work duties.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.063
Doreen!

09:24.103 --> 09:26.223
Hi. Come in. Thank you.

09:26.263 --> 09:27.983
Come and have a seat.

09:28.663 --> 09:30.503
What would you like to talk about?

09:30.543 --> 09:32.023
Um, first of all,

09:32.063 --> 09:35.543
I want to apologise for what I said,
you know, last time.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.503
I was upset
and I really should have...

09:37.543 --> 09:39.703
Oh, no. No need.
No, look, this is a safe place.

09:39.743 --> 09:41.823
You can express your frustrations.

09:42.463 --> 09:44.023
So how can I help you?

09:44.063 --> 09:47.423
I want to apply for a transfer,
to Perth.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.343
OK.

09:49.383 --> 09:51.623
Have you weighed all of this up?

09:51.663 --> 09:55.743
I know I'll be back to square one
there, with no friends, or crew.

09:55.783 --> 09:59.103
I'll be on my own again.
It'll be tough.

09:59.143 --> 10:00.663
Think you'll be able to cope?

10:00.703 --> 10:03.143
Well, the girls here
have been like family to me.

10:03.183 --> 10:08.823
I'll miss 'em, but Josh and Nash
are my real family now.

10:08.863 --> 10:10.543
OK.

10:10.583 --> 10:14.383
Well, I'll organise the forms
and write a recommendation for you.

10:14.423 --> 10:16.423
Awesome. Thank you.

10:16.463 --> 10:20.623
Doesn't necessarily mean it'll
happen automatically but, you know,

10:20.663 --> 10:23.823
you'll have to put your case
before the board, in person.

10:23.863 --> 10:27.223
You mean like a parole hearing?
Mm-hm.

10:27.263 --> 10:29.143
You'll be able to handle that?

10:29.183 --> 10:30.783
I'll have to, eh?

10:31.743 --> 10:32.743
Yeah?
Yeah.

10:32.783 --> 10:33.783
OK.

10:38.703 --> 10:39.783
Whatever.

10:41.863 --> 10:43.223
Yes!

10:43.263 --> 10:44.943
What?

10:44.983 --> 10:46.823
Oh, nasi goreng is my fave.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.143
You serious?
Yes!

10:49.183 --> 10:52.263
Hey, Miss Smiles, who's the spunk?

10:52.303 --> 10:54.743
Emergency plumber,
so your food doesn't go off.

10:54.783 --> 10:56.783
Eugh, who could tell?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.303
Franky, Franky, I need your help.

10:59.343 --> 11:00.383
Yeah?

11:00.423 --> 11:03.159
I'm applying for a transfer and I've
gotta present my case to the board.

11:03.183 --> 11:04.783
Oh, Dors.
Yeah!

11:04.823 --> 11:07.063
Fuck's sake,
are you goin' now, too?

11:07.103 --> 11:09.103
Love, she wants to be
with her little family.

11:09.143 --> 11:10.943
Hey, Franky, Franky.
Yes, what?

11:10.983 --> 11:13.703
You can use your legal skills
to help me write something amazing.

11:13.743 --> 11:14.783
Can you help me, please?

11:14.823 --> 11:16.943
Alright, just chillax,
will ya, ya cutie?

11:16.983 --> 11:18.223
Thank you!

11:19.143 --> 11:21.103
Lizzie, how's that dodgy ticker
of yours?

11:21.143 --> 11:22.143
What?

11:22.183 --> 11:25.663
Heard you was in Medical
most of the day yesterday.

11:25.703 --> 11:28.023
Severe chest pain's what I heard.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.583
Yeah, no, it was indigestion.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.079
They did all the tests
and everything,

11:31.103 --> 11:34.103
but they just said it was...
Indigestion.

11:34.143 --> 11:37.583
Yeah.
Can't say I'm surprised.

11:45.023 --> 11:46.943
I reckon Juice is suss.

11:46.983 --> 11:48.423
Juice?
Mmm.

11:48.463 --> 11:51.583
You're being paranoid.
Am I?

11:56.463 --> 12:00.383
Eugh! That is fuckin' disgusting!

12:00.423 --> 12:02.263
I wouldn't feed this shit to pigs!

12:03.623 --> 12:04.903
It's shit!

12:04.943 --> 12:06.039
So it's not your favourite, then?

12:06.063 --> 12:08.103
Disgusting!
You are disgusting, Doyle.

12:08.143 --> 12:09.639
Go and get a mop
and clean that up now.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.463
Oh, come on, Smiles.
You know it's shit!

12:12.503 --> 12:13.583
Shit!

12:13.623 --> 12:15.223
Shit!
Shit! Shit!

12:15.263 --> 12:18.663
Shit! Shit!
It's shit!

12:18.703 --> 12:26.703
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

12:26.943 --> 12:29.783
Shut up, the lot of you,
unless you want to go to the slot!

12:29.823 --> 12:31.303
How big's your slot?

12:36.823 --> 12:38.263
What are you waiting for, Doyle?

13:14.863 --> 13:16.783
Hello?
Oh.

13:16.823 --> 13:18.943
Sonia, it's Liz.

13:18.983 --> 13:23.263
Liz! I'm so glad you called.
You got my message, obviously.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.423
Yes, yeah.

13:25.463 --> 13:26.799
I just couldn't wait
to tell you the good news.

13:26.823 --> 13:29.463
I have been completely vindicated.

13:29.503 --> 13:31.663
All charges dropped.

13:31.703 --> 13:34.703
Oh, wow, that's... That's amazing.

13:34.743 --> 13:38.183
I... I mean, you deserve it.
Congratulations.

13:38.223 --> 13:39.583
And you'll never guess.

13:39.623 --> 13:41.743
You know that mystery witness
I was so worried about?

13:41.783 --> 13:43.303
Yeah?

13:43.343 --> 13:46.543
Just as I said,
liars always come undone in the end.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.583
Oh.

13:47.623 --> 13:50.023
Completely fell apart in
the witness box, my barrister said.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.503
He decimated her.

13:51.543 --> 13:54.143
Reduced her to a blithering idiot,
by all accounts,

13:54.183 --> 13:57.183
although he claims
it wasn't that difficult.

13:57.223 --> 14:00.543
Oh, I'm really happy for you,
Sonia.

14:00.583 --> 14:04.063
Thank you. I knew you would be.

14:04.103 --> 14:06.903
So, I thought
I would come by and visit...

14:06.943 --> 14:11.623
No. No, no, I don't reckon
that's a good idea.

14:11.663 --> 14:14.423
I mean, you don't belong
in this world, Sonia.

14:14.463 --> 14:16.943
You know, you should
get on with your life,

14:16.983 --> 14:21.863
and put it all behind ya.
You know, forget about this place.

14:21.903 --> 14:27.583
Oh. Well, I do see what you mean,
I suppose. You're right. But...

14:27.623 --> 14:30.863
Oh, dear, what a shame.
There's someone at the door.

14:30.903 --> 14:31.983
I have to go.

14:32.023 --> 14:34.943
No, that's OK.
That's perfectly fine.

14:34.983 --> 14:37.623
Now, make sure you come and see me
when you're released.

14:37.663 --> 14:39.343
I will look after you.

14:39.383 --> 14:41.583
Great. Thanks, Sonia.

14:41.623 --> 14:43.663
Bye for now, Liz.
Bye. Bye.

14:50.143 --> 14:52.783
Did you come alone
or did you bring the force with you?

14:52.823 --> 14:53.863
Cute.

15:06.350 --> 15:08.606
I've just had a call from the
tradesman who was here yesterday.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.070
He wants my number?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.110
He called to report
a missing shifting spanner.

15:13.150 --> 15:15.390
It's possible one of the prisoners
has stolen it.

15:15.430 --> 15:17.446
Cell lockdown or cell toss
straight after breakfast?

15:17.470 --> 15:18.750
You read my mind, Mr Jackson.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.830
If it is in this prison,
I want that shifter found,

15:20.870 --> 15:23.590
preferably before it's used
to part someone's hair.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.390
So, any leads on whether
it was malicious damage to the tap?

15:26.430 --> 15:28.510
Ahh, the CCTV showed
nothing, Governor.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.470
Alright, that's it.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.390
Bridget?
Mmm?

15:37.110 --> 15:40.790
Just so you know, I've shut down
that business with Ferguson.

15:40.830 --> 15:42.590
I appreciate that.

15:42.630 --> 15:45.110
And thank you for what you said
to the Ombudsman.

15:45.150 --> 15:48.950
I've decided to
keep my distance from Franky.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.750
You know a lot of women here
rely on you.

15:54.270 --> 15:56.710
Myself included.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.030
Heads up, Mercado.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.406
There's going to be a cell toss
any minute.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.430
Shit!

16:06.470 --> 16:08.166
If you're holding,
you'd better get rid of it.

16:08.190 --> 16:11.030
There's not much left after Proctor
cleaned me out. I lost big time.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.430
You have to write it off.

16:12.470 --> 16:13.686
You'll have to bring in more gear.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.230
No, not now.
It's too hot in the kitchen.

16:16.270 --> 16:18.230
Well, I can't leave work unit now.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.270
So get pinged.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.790
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Get my stash.

16:21.830 --> 16:22.990
What?

16:23.030 --> 16:24.710
Hold it for me.
Jesus Christ!

16:24.750 --> 16:26.670
You wanna keep
doing business or not?

16:55.110 --> 16:56.870
G'day, Jake. How're you going?
G'day, fellas.

16:59.030 --> 17:00.030
Fuck!

17:45.390 --> 17:48.350
Don. It's me.
Hi, Sonia.

17:48.390 --> 17:51.590
Listen, um,
I'm in a bit of a pickle here.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.630
What's wrong?
I'm going to need your help.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.590
How'd you sleep?

18:05.630 --> 18:08.950
Extremely well,
thanks to my little helpers.

18:08.990 --> 18:11.390
Oh, thank God
I'm back in the free world.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.150
I prefer alcohol.

18:14.190 --> 18:15.270
I noticed.

18:15.310 --> 18:18.470
Well, we were celebrating.
Yes.

18:19.670 --> 18:21.510
I s'pose you've got your future
all mapped out

18:21.550 --> 18:23.310
now you've got me off the hook.

18:23.350 --> 18:24.990
You bet.

18:25.030 --> 18:28.550
Gonna apply for stress leave,
then resign.

18:28.590 --> 18:32.790
Collect my super,
buy a bar somewhere, on a beach,

18:32.830 --> 18:35.150
and just live happily ever after.

18:35.190 --> 18:37.870
You have worked it all out.
Mmm.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.310
You could come with me.

18:40.350 --> 18:41.806
Do you really think
our relationship's

18:41.830 --> 18:44.270
the sentimental kind?

18:52.070 --> 18:53.390
You've reached Don Kaplan.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.566
I'm not available at the moment
but if the matter is urgent,

18:55.590 --> 18:57.830
please leave me a detailed message
at the tone.

18:59.910 --> 19:02.910
Don, it's Liz. Birdsworth.

19:02.950 --> 19:06.630
Um, I'm just wondering
if there's any news.

19:06.670 --> 19:08.750
Anyway, I'll try you again later.

19:11.830 --> 19:14.390
Well, why didn't you answer it?

19:14.430 --> 19:15.910
Are you embarrassed?

19:18.110 --> 19:19.126
I've got nothin' to say to her.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.670
Oh, I can just imagine
what fantasies you've been concocting

19:21.710 --> 19:24.590
for the silly old cow.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.030
Without that silly old cow,
you would have been screwed.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.230
I think you've got
a bit of a soft spot for her.

19:30.950 --> 19:33.750
I played her, that's all.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.270
And you'll pay me.

19:35.310 --> 19:37.350
That was the deal.

19:41.990 --> 19:46.230
Tonight.
I'll have your money for you.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.870
We'll make a night of it.

19:50.110 --> 19:52.750
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.230
All prisoners return to your cells.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.870
Hey, Allie.

19:56.910 --> 19:59.630
Can you come here for a sec?
What's up?

19:59.670 --> 20:01.790
I gotta ask you something.
It's huge. Come on.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.710
OK, ladies,
standing outside your cells.

20:05.750 --> 20:06.750
This is a cell toss.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.446
Let's go, please!
Good morning, Mr Jackson.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.910
Oh, I see you haven't
got your pips back yet.

20:10.950 --> 20:13.710
Oh, I will, and then things
will change around here, Proctor.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.670
What are you talking about?
Are you on drugs?

20:15.710 --> 20:19.390
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, ladies, come on!

20:21.110 --> 20:22.406
Novak, what are you
still doing here?

20:22.430 --> 20:23.990
Sorry, Mr J. I'm going.
Thank you.

20:24.030 --> 20:25.670
So, exactly what
is going to change?

20:25.710 --> 20:27.430
You've just been demoted, numb nuts.

20:27.470 --> 20:29.630
Proctor, you can stand there
and act like a child,

20:29.670 --> 20:32.830
or you can be a great leader
and be part of the solution.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.606
I don't think I want to be
a part of anything

20:34.630 --> 20:35.910
that you've got going on.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.550
Oh, your choice.

20:37.590 --> 20:40.350
It'll get done, with or without you.

20:40.390 --> 20:42.590
Come on, ladies, move on.

20:48.510 --> 20:51.390
All prisoners out of their cells!
Standing by your doors, please.

20:51.430 --> 20:53.550
The system is corrupt.

20:58.230 --> 21:00.790
Ms Miles?
What is it, Ferguson?

21:00.830 --> 21:04.790
That, um, tradesman
who was here yesterday.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.150
What about him?

21:06.190 --> 21:09.190
I believe he shared
a hot tip for Kyneton today

21:09.230 --> 21:10.510
with a number
of your colleagues.

21:10.550 --> 21:15.190
Did he mention it to you?
No. What was it?

21:15.230 --> 21:21.310
Oh, what was it? It was, um,
something like, um, Furphy?

21:21.350 --> 21:23.270
Don't waste my time, Ferguson.

21:23.310 --> 21:25.470
Gambaro! Come out now.
Don't make me come in there

21:25.510 --> 21:26.950
and haul you out.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.190
Ms Miles.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.950
Ahh! Just watch my arm.

21:58.790 --> 22:00.710
Anything, guys?
Nah.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.510
Alright, let's go.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.726
We didn't find the missing shifter
in the cell toss,

22:19.750 --> 22:23.270
but we didn't come up
completely empty-handed.

22:27.670 --> 22:29.150
Liquid nicotine.

22:29.190 --> 22:31.670
Clearly, we need to step up
our security measures.

22:34.550 --> 22:36.566
Attention, compound,
prisoners may now leave their unit.

22:36.590 --> 22:38.790
Hey! Lockdown's over.

22:39.630 --> 22:41.550
Yeah, I know.

22:41.590 --> 22:43.750
So I want my shifter back.

22:43.790 --> 22:45.670
What? No, "Oh, thanks, Allie",

22:45.710 --> 22:48.270
" for risking a fuckin' fortnight
in the slot for me."

22:48.310 --> 22:50.470
I'm sorry, there was no time
to explain.

22:50.510 --> 22:52.990
Well, there's time now.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.310
Just give it back.

22:54.350 --> 22:55.830
No.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.686
Not until you tell me what
the fuck is going on.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.710
What if I don't want to?

22:58.750 --> 23:00.430
Then you don't get
your shifter back.

23:00.470 --> 23:02.870
Bullshit! Come on, give it back!

23:04.590 --> 23:06.830
Ow, ow! Fuck!

23:06.870 --> 23:09.350
Ahh, shit! Get off! Fuck!

23:09.390 --> 23:11.430
Jeez, you're hurting my arm.
I don't care.

23:11.470 --> 23:15.310
Don't! Fuck. It's not in there.
Where is it then?

23:16.470 --> 23:18.990
Do you want a Chinese burn?

23:20.550 --> 23:22.990
Fuck, I'm not kidding!

23:23.030 --> 23:26.190
Ahh, fuck! Fuck!

23:45.550 --> 23:49.550
Thanks.
I appreciate what you did.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.070
So, are you gonna tell me
or not?

23:53.910 --> 23:54.950
Nuh.

24:01.270 --> 24:05.590
So, what's your game, Freak?
Why'd you help me out?

24:05.630 --> 24:08.390
Consider it prisoner solidarity.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.910
Get fucked.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.670
You know, we might be in here
for quite a while together.

24:13.710 --> 24:15.790
Don't you think it's time
we buried the hatchet?

24:15.830 --> 24:19.070
I'll bury it in your back, Fergo.

24:19.110 --> 24:24.350
I don't want you as an enemy, Lucy.
I would prefer you as an ally.

24:24.390 --> 24:26.510
And I'd prefer you to fuck off.

24:26.550 --> 24:29.150
Was that the last of your stash,
was it?

24:29.190 --> 24:30.670
So what if it was?

24:31.550 --> 24:33.470
Better enjoy it.

24:33.510 --> 24:35.830
With Vera Bennett and Kaz
Proctor joining forces,

24:35.870 --> 24:39.390
life's about to get
a whole lot more boring in here.

24:39.430 --> 24:40.710
What do you care?

24:40.750 --> 24:42.430
I know there's a way
around the problem.

24:42.470 --> 24:44.110
What?
What do you think you're doing?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.270
Luce and I were just having
a friendly chat.

24:46.310 --> 24:49.950
It's not that hard, Juice.
Stay away from ghosts.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.030
Go on.
Get lost.

25:04.390 --> 25:06.030
Started without me, eh?

25:06.070 --> 25:09.430
I told you,
I intend to make a night of it.

25:14.270 --> 25:17.950
A toast, to my brilliant detective.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.790
You know, I always thought
you were wasted on the police.

25:22.830 --> 25:24.030
It's true.

25:24.070 --> 25:28.230
Just a couple of little details
I don't quite understand.

25:29.870 --> 25:31.990
You want me to give away
all my secrets?

25:32.030 --> 25:35.070
Don't worry, I've more than fulfilled
my end of the bargain.

25:36.790 --> 25:38.230
So where's the money?

25:45.230 --> 25:46.510
You don't trust me?

25:50.870 --> 25:53.310
I just like the smell of money
with my champagne.

25:53.350 --> 25:58.670
You know, my barrister told me that
Helen's phone was found in Sassafras

25:58.710 --> 26:00.950
on the morning of Liz's testimony.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.230
Remarkable.

26:03.870 --> 26:06.350
Yeah, they say it's lovely up there
this time of year.

26:09.270 --> 26:10.950
I see.

26:10.990 --> 26:14.430
Well, I s'pose it's a good idea
to tie up all the loose ends.

26:14.470 --> 26:18.510
Yep, that's true. Now, the money
was only part of our agreement.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.870
The DPP intend to charge you

26:29.910 --> 26:31.550
with the murder of Helen Masters.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.630
Can you help me?

26:32.670 --> 26:34.206
They've got a lot
of compelling evidence.

26:34.230 --> 26:35.526
Well, you need to pull some strings.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.806
You're going to be remanded
to Wentworth.

26:36.830 --> 26:39.750
Don, that is simply not an option,
alright?

26:39.790 --> 26:43.670
Unless I can find a way
to subvert the trial.

26:43.710 --> 26:44.990
Thank you.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.510
But I'm not going to
fuck my entire career for nothing.

26:47.550 --> 26:48.990
No, no, of course not.

26:49.030 --> 26:51.750
When this is over,
I'll make it worth your while.

26:51.790 --> 26:53.430
I'm not greedy.

26:53.470 --> 26:54.950
Thank you.

26:56.470 --> 26:58.630
There's one more thing I want.
A sweetener to the deal.

27:00.030 --> 27:01.190
What do you mean?

27:01.230 --> 27:03.270
I want to know what really happened
to your husband.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.350
You know I can't tell you that.

27:07.390 --> 27:11.030
I know you did it,
I just don't know how, or why.

27:11.070 --> 27:14.550
You had a charmed life
with the guy. Successful business...

27:14.590 --> 27:18.030
Geoffrey was a gambling,
womanising arsehole.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.270
I was the one who brought that
company up to what it is today.

27:21.310 --> 27:22.606
With your blood, sweat and tears?

27:22.630 --> 27:25.910
That's right.
All he did was take the credit.

27:25.950 --> 27:27.270
So you killed him?

27:27.310 --> 27:31.190
What is this, the last resort
of a frustrated investigation?

27:31.230 --> 27:33.190
Is that why you started fucking me?

27:33.230 --> 27:34.630
It's pretty obvious what happened.

27:34.670 --> 27:36.990
Helen was your alibi
the night your husband disappeared.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.790
She knew about the murder.
Now she's gone, too.

27:39.830 --> 27:41.470
Was she blackmailing you with that?

27:41.510 --> 27:43.390
You have your money.
Stop badgering me.

27:43.430 --> 27:45.430
I'm sorry, I must be getting drunk.

27:49.230 --> 27:51.590
It's just that
I need a bit of insurance, too.

27:51.630 --> 27:53.270
What insurance?
Well, you could ruin me.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.910
Oh, come on. You know about Helen.

27:55.950 --> 27:57.030
That doesn't count.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.910
I'd be implicating myself,
wouldn't I?

27:59.950 --> 28:01.310
So tell me,

28:03.390 --> 28:07.150
what'd you do with your husband?

28:07.190 --> 28:13.070
Alright. Come for a drive.
I'll show you.

28:20.230 --> 28:24.030
So that was your move,
to get me in the shit with Kaz.

28:24.070 --> 28:27.950
You're not intimidated
by that toothless tiger.

28:29.510 --> 28:31.830
She'll never raise a hand
against a woman.

28:31.870 --> 28:34.590
There are other
ways to fuck with us.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.230
You should know.

28:36.270 --> 28:39.030
Well, perhaps that's why you
should listen to my proposal.

28:41.910 --> 28:44.310
Don't you want to take back
what Kaz has taken away?

28:47.910 --> 28:50.350
Hey, Franky, is this a good time?

28:50.390 --> 28:52.870
You said you'd help me
with my transfer application.

28:52.910 --> 28:55.510
Yeah, I need a break.
Going round in circles. Sit down.

28:55.550 --> 28:57.990
That's the application form
I've gotta fill in.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.790
Just do it. It's piss-easy.

29:05.830 --> 29:08.350
I don't know what I'm going to say
to the board.

29:08.390 --> 29:10.430
I've never been very good
at public speaking.

29:10.470 --> 29:11.726
Well, you don't think of it
like that.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.670
It's just you,
talking from the heart,

29:13.710 --> 29:15.510
about what's important to ya.

29:15.550 --> 29:17.230
I'm scared, Franky.
Hey, listen.

29:17.270 --> 29:20.190
I'm scared I'm gonna fuck it up!
Just fuckin' listen up, alright?

29:20.230 --> 29:21.566
You've got a chance
to get out of here.

29:21.590 --> 29:23.030
You just grab it.

29:23.070 --> 29:24.830
You don't even hesitate.

29:24.870 --> 29:26.806
You fuckin' see that chance,
even if it's a long shot,

29:26.830 --> 29:30.190
you take that risk,
'cause you got everythin' to gain

29:30.230 --> 29:32.110
and nothin' to lose.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.950
Feeling alright?

29:54.990 --> 29:58.430
Oh, I'm just a bit tired,
that's all.

30:08.710 --> 30:09.950
Come in.

30:09.990 --> 30:11.230
Governor, got Doyle for you.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.950
OK. Come in, Doyle.
Thank you, Mr Jackson.

30:13.990 --> 30:15.486
We'll have to make this quick.
It's almost lockdown.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.670
Oh, yeah, thanks for seeing me.

30:17.710 --> 30:18.870
What do you want?

30:18.910 --> 30:20.366
I'm going crazy working
in the laundry.

30:20.390 --> 30:22.350
All that politics
is doing my head in.

30:22.390 --> 30:23.846
I have thought the laundry
isn't ideal

30:23.870 --> 30:25.670
for a prisoner of your potential.

30:25.710 --> 30:27.190
So can I switch details?

30:29.590 --> 30:32.190
Well, you've helped fellow inmates
with their legal issues

30:32.230 --> 30:33.430
from time to time.

30:33.470 --> 30:35.550
How about we make that official?

30:35.590 --> 30:37.470
Your own work unit,
in the education centre,

30:37.510 --> 30:38.830
as prisoner advocate.

30:38.870 --> 30:42.190
Nah, I was more thinking
working in the outdoor unit.

30:42.230 --> 30:44.590
I'm just desperate
to get into the open air.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.390
Oh, really?

30:46.430 --> 30:48.550
Yeah, I feel like I'm really
cooped up in here,

30:48.590 --> 30:50.086
not walking around
like a normal person.

30:50.110 --> 30:53.150
I feel like I'm getting anxious.
Well, surely that's not a surprise.

30:53.190 --> 30:55.390
Why, 'cause I'm back in prison
after a taste of freedom?

30:57.590 --> 30:58.670
Yes.

30:58.710 --> 31:01.230
I haven't been convicted yet,
Ms Bennett.

31:01.270 --> 31:02.326
I am aware of that, Doyle...

31:02.350 --> 31:04.750
And I plan to prove my innocence
in court.

31:05.870 --> 31:06.910
Alright.

31:08.190 --> 31:12.990
You can start on the grounds detail
as of tomorrow.

31:13.030 --> 31:14.670
Thanks.

31:34.270 --> 31:35.670
Where are we?

31:35.710 --> 31:37.350
Nearly there.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.990
Oh.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.270
Feel a bit woozy.

31:44.310 --> 31:46.110
Well, just sit back. Relax.

31:46.910 --> 31:48.870
Not long now.

31:50.430 --> 31:53.150
It's just so...

31:55.270 --> 31:56.270
Hmm.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.630
You wanted to know
what happened to my husband.

32:06.350 --> 32:09.310
Attention, compound.
A lockdown is now in force.

32:09.350 --> 32:12.670
All prisoners must return
to their units immediately.

32:12.710 --> 32:15.350
Don, it's Liz. Look,
I left a message earlier

32:15.390 --> 32:17.166
and I'm just a bit worried 'cause
I haven't been able to...

32:17.190 --> 32:18.950
Birdsworth.
Jesus, Mr Stewart!

32:18.990 --> 32:20.430
You just gave me a heart attack.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.230
Lockdown's been called.
Hang up now, please.

32:22.270 --> 32:24.950
Yeah, well, can I just...
Come on, let's go.

33:28.630 --> 33:31.630
I knew the drink was spiked.
You bitch!

33:35.065 --> 33:36.225
Ow.

34:57.305 --> 34:58.785
Shit!

35:06.105 --> 35:08.025
You, uh... you lost something?

35:08.065 --> 35:11.345
No, uh, just dropped my keys.
The CSDS are here?

35:11.385 --> 35:13.945
Yeah, Governor's going hard
on the drug problem.

35:13.985 --> 35:16.585
There's gonna be a dog at the
entrance for the rest of the week.

35:16.625 --> 35:17.625
Huh.

35:17.665 --> 35:19.785
What, she didn't tell you?

35:19.825 --> 35:22.825
Yeah. Yeah, no.
No, of course she did.

35:22.865 --> 35:24.065
Yeah.

35:26.145 --> 35:29.225
He said he'd be in contact yesterday
with an update on my charges

35:29.265 --> 35:30.785
and I ...I haven't heard from him.

35:30.825 --> 35:32.521
OK. Well, maybe if you call
and leave a message.

35:32.545 --> 35:33.865
Yeah, I have.

35:33.905 --> 35:37.465
I tried, several times,
yesterday and this morning

35:37.505 --> 35:39.825
and he's not picking up
and it's really not like him.

35:39.865 --> 35:41.001
Alright, well,
he's probably very busy.

35:41.025 --> 35:42.121
He'll call when he has news.

35:42.145 --> 35:44.385
Please. Please, could you just
make contact with him

35:44.425 --> 35:46.401
at police headquarters on my behalf?
Oh, Liz, no, I don't think...

35:46.425 --> 35:47.721
It's really not...
He wouldn't do this to me.

35:47.745 --> 35:51.025
I think you're overreacting.
No, I'm not.

35:51.065 --> 35:55.625
He... he wouldn't leave me hanging
unless something bad had happened.

35:55.665 --> 35:57.465
Please.

36:00.905 --> 36:02.745
G'day, Ms Miles.
Proctor.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.945
Ms Miles.
Look around, ladies.

36:04.985 --> 36:08.145
You don't see anyone
off their faces today, do you?

36:09.985 --> 36:10.985
Nuh.

36:12.425 --> 36:14.065
Proctor.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.985
Do you want some play money
for the track today, Smiles?

36:30.745 --> 36:32.705
Depends.

36:32.745 --> 36:35.345
Why did Jackson lose
the deputy governorship?

36:37.785 --> 36:41.105
Big night. Positive piss test.

36:41.145 --> 36:43.745
Is that all?
No, he's an axe murderer.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.825
Ha, ha, ha.

36:55.305 --> 36:57.505
Getting too hot to bring drugs in?

36:59.425 --> 37:03.185
What you need
is an alternative conduit.

37:03.225 --> 37:04.601
Yeah, thanks for that,
Captain Obvious.

37:04.625 --> 37:08.105
As it happens, I have a solution.

37:08.145 --> 37:09.665
What is it?

37:09.705 --> 37:11.785
Not so fast. Send Tina to me first.

37:14.545 --> 37:17.025
Since when's Franky
been on garden detail?

37:20.145 --> 37:21.825
I dunno.

38:50.625 --> 38:52.825
Sonia Stevens?
You're wanted for questioning

38:52.865 --> 38:55.825
regarding the disappearance
of your husband.

38:59.385 --> 39:00.905
There's been some new information.

39:00.945 --> 39:02.921
We're sending divers down
to a lake in South Gippsland

39:02.945 --> 39:04.985
to search for human remains,

39:05.025 --> 39:07.105
believed to be those
of Geoffrey Stevens.

39:11.465 --> 39:12.865
Yeah, I understand.

39:14.905 --> 39:16.225
Thank you, Officer.

39:17.785 --> 39:18.985
What'd they say?

39:19.025 --> 39:22.425
It appears Detective Kaplan
has taken stress leave.

39:23.865 --> 39:26.225
For how long?
They didn't say.

39:26.905 --> 39:29.705
Where... where does that leave me?

39:29.745 --> 39:32.545
Just...

39:32.585 --> 39:35.665
Governor Bennett.

39:35.705 --> 39:39.585
Could you hold for a
moment, please?

39:39.625 --> 39:41.945
I am sorry, Liz,
I have to take this call.

39:45.705 --> 39:49.185
Oh, good. Could you, uh, take
Birdsworth back to her unit, please?

39:49.225 --> 39:50.345
Sure.

39:50.385 --> 39:52.945
Um, you never
mentioned you'd called in the CSDS.

39:52.985 --> 39:55.225
Ahh, yes, sorry.
It was last night after you'd left.

39:55.265 --> 39:56.985
Will convinced me
it was necessary.

40:03.545 --> 40:05.545
Mr Stewart said you
wanted to see me.

40:05.585 --> 40:07.425
Time's up on my offer.

40:07.465 --> 40:09.385
I'm here.

40:09.425 --> 40:11.305
So you are.

40:11.345 --> 40:15.465
But now the situation
is a little more fluid.

40:15.505 --> 40:16.945
Fluid?

40:16.985 --> 40:19.025
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:19.065 --> 40:22.825
Now there is a catch.

40:23.425 --> 40:24.785
What?

40:24.825 --> 40:26.625
A third party is involved.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.545
Now, I called you here

40:28.585 --> 40:32.025
because you're all
stakeholders in this business.

40:32.065 --> 40:34.985
Buyers and sellers together.

40:35.625 --> 40:37.185
You're all aware of the problem.

40:39.665 --> 40:41.345
I hold the solution.

40:44.065 --> 40:46.185
A new drug conduit.

40:48.545 --> 40:52.625
You can get as rich and/or
as high as you like

40:52.665 --> 40:57.505
and not have to answer to Kaz
or the management.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.345
OK, we're listening.

41:01.505 --> 41:03.705
But what's in it for you?

41:06.945 --> 41:09.105
Partnership.

41:13.625 --> 41:15.665
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

41:15.705 --> 41:17.785
The canteen is now open for 8:00.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.745
What the fuck are you doing in here?

41:21.785 --> 41:22.945
Are you stalking me now?

41:22.985 --> 41:24.985
I know that you got something
going on.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.785
Oh, well, everyone's got
something goin' on.

41:26.825 --> 41:28.385
Everyone's working some angle.

41:28.425 --> 41:29.665
No, it's more than that.

41:30.585 --> 41:32.825
I can tell it's something big.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.105
OK, fine. Now fuck off
and let me get changed.

41:35.145 --> 41:37.105
You were there for me when...

41:40.145 --> 41:41.665
Bea brought us together
for a reason.

41:41.705 --> 41:43.625
I really believe that.

41:46.105 --> 41:48.865
Whatever it is you're doing,
I wanna help you.

41:48.905 --> 41:50.545
Well, you can't help.

41:50.585 --> 41:52.561
Why not? You can trust...
Sh! Keep your voice down,

41:52.585 --> 41:54.465
you understand? Or I am dead.

41:57.105 --> 41:58.785
Now, you can't help me.

42:01.305 --> 42:03.145
You're gonna escape.
Listen...

42:03.185 --> 42:04.865
Fuck, Franky, that is crazy.

42:04.905 --> 42:06.481
I gotta clear my name.
You will get caught!

42:06.505 --> 42:07.905
Shut the fuck up!

42:08.905 --> 42:10.865
You are gonna get caught

42:10.905 --> 42:13.905
and it'll make it
a whole lot worse for your case.

42:13.945 --> 42:16.105
If the police find
the real killer then you're only...

42:16.145 --> 42:17.601
The police won't find
Mike Pennisi's killer

42:17.625 --> 42:19.705
'cause they're fuckin'
not looking.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.305
But the killer is out there.
