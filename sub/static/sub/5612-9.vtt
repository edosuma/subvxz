00:01.004 --> 00:04.212
My fellow detectives,
ours is not an easy job.

00:04.247 --> 00:05.447
The hours are long.

00:05.448 --> 00:06.949
The danger is constant.

00:06.950 --> 00:09.051
The pay is LOL.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.751
But today, a glimmer of hope.

00:10.787 --> 00:14.423
For today... a new
vending machine.

00:16.024 --> 00:18.260
Behold him in all of his glory.

00:18.261 --> 00:21.597
So full of strength and promise,
and most importantly,

00:21.598 --> 00:22.864
sodium, gluten, and fat.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.300
- Whoo!
- The time has finally come

00:25.301 --> 00:27.536
to christen the machine.

00:27.537 --> 00:29.271
- Boyle, the champagne?
- Oh, well, technically

00:29.272 --> 00:31.640
it's a Hungarian Pezsgo
from the Tarnok Valley.

00:31.641 --> 00:33.108
For once in your life,
don't ruin it.

00:33.109 --> 00:34.176
Give him the bottle.

00:34.177 --> 00:36.245
Thank you.

00:36.246 --> 00:40.648
I hereby christen
thee Snacky Chan!

00:43.553 --> 00:44.853
Whoa!

00:44.854 --> 00:47.589
Okay, well, at least it
was just the keypad.

00:47.590 --> 00:48.959
None of the snacks
got messed up.

00:48.992 --> 00:50.224
Whoa!

00:50.260 --> 00:51.759
- Go!
- Oh, right!

00:51.794 --> 00:52.794
Okay, okay.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.129
No!

00:54.130 --> 00:57.598
It should've been me.
It should've been me!

01:18.855 --> 01:20.956
Our perp's name is Karl Ove.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.824
My CI said he's selling
counterfeit caviar

01:22.825 --> 01:23.824
out of a blue stall.

01:23.826 --> 01:25.360
This place smells
like a squid farted

01:25.361 --> 01:26.361
inside a whale's butt.

01:27.397 --> 01:29.298
Yes, that is the exact combo
of smells.

01:29.299 --> 01:31.833
Nicely done.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.835
Hey, next week is my six-month
anniversary with Amy.

01:33.836 --> 01:35.036
Should I do something special?

01:35.071 --> 01:36.405
You know what I like about
our relationship, Jake?

01:36.406 --> 01:37.639
We don't talk about
our love lives,

01:37.640 --> 01:39.107
or our families, or anything
that's on our minds.

01:39.108 --> 01:40.943
It's why you're
my closest friend in the world.

01:40.944 --> 01:42.678
Yeah, I know,
but I need help on this.

01:42.679 --> 01:44.580
I asked Boyle
and he was useless.

01:44.581 --> 01:45.847
Put a baby in her, Jake.

01:45.848 --> 01:47.449
What are you waiting for?

01:47.450 --> 01:49.718
So do that then.
Problem solved.

01:49.719 --> 01:52.921
Look, it's our guy.

01:52.922 --> 01:54.656
Excuse me, sir,
we're with the NYPD.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.290
I just need to ask
you a couple of...

01:56.326 --> 01:57.859
Oh, shrimp!

01:57.860 --> 01:59.127
I hate that!

02:08.770 --> 02:10.205
You're under arrest, punk.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.707
Nobody gets away
from Jake Per... ew!

02:11.708 --> 02:13.342
Something yucky touched me!

02:13.343 --> 02:14.943
Ugh, gross, gross, gross!

02:14.944 --> 02:18.046
Hang on.
What's that?

02:18.047 --> 02:19.848
What have we here?

02:21.150 --> 02:22.150
What?

02:24.020 --> 02:26.621
I have no idea
what you're saying.

02:28.558 --> 02:30.758
Just as I suspected immediately.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.327
It's a flawless 39-carat diamond

02:32.328 --> 02:33.495
that was stolen six weeks ago

02:33.496 --> 02:34.796
from the Royal Stockholm Museum.

02:34.797 --> 02:36.365
I've just received word
from Interpol

02:36.366 --> 02:38.267
that two detectives
are on their way from Sweden

02:38.268 --> 02:39.268
to pick up the suspect.

02:39.269 --> 02:40.736
Please make them feel welcome.

02:40.737 --> 02:41.970
Welcome?

02:41.971 --> 02:43.871
We're gonna roll out
the fricking red carpet.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.574
Working a jewel heist
with Interpol?

02:45.575 --> 02:47.843
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

02:47.844 --> 02:49.543
- Second best.
- Aww.

02:49.579 --> 02:50.646
First best.

02:50.647 --> 02:53.181
I was lying to Amy.

02:56.019 --> 02:59.020
Do you guys know anyone
who wants some used textbooks?

02:59.055 --> 03:00.455
I'd love them.

03:00.456 --> 03:01.923
It's never too late to teach
yourself something new...

03:01.924 --> 03:03.191
So no one.

03:03.192 --> 03:05.227
Great.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.595
Why are you throwing those out?

03:06.596 --> 03:09.898
Because I'm never gonna
pass this astronomy final,

03:09.899 --> 03:12.501
so I won't graduate,
so my life is ruined.

03:12.502 --> 03:14.503
Or we could help you study.

03:14.504 --> 03:17.639
I did graduate
magna cum laude from Syracuse.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.974
I know that sounds like a brag.

03:18.975 --> 03:20.609
And it was!

03:20.610 --> 03:22.009
Terry killed it in college.

03:22.045 --> 03:24.179
Plus, I know a thing
or two about astronomy.

03:24.180 --> 03:28.550
I had 11 straight birthdays
at the planetarium.

03:28.551 --> 03:29.751
That was also a brag.

03:29.752 --> 03:33.488
My God, you guys are
such pathetic nerds.

03:33.489 --> 03:36.758
But maybe that's what I need
right now, pathetic nerds.

03:36.759 --> 03:37.959
Okay.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.196
You pathetic nerds can help me.

03:41.197 --> 03:42.197
Thank you?

03:42.198 --> 03:44.865
You are so welcome.

03:44.901 --> 03:46.568
Peralta, Diaz.

03:46.569 --> 03:50.372
This is Inspector Knausgaard
and Deputy Inspector Carlsson.

03:50.373 --> 03:51.773
Their flight here
was eight hours.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.241
It's been a pleasure
talking with you

03:53.242 --> 03:54.742
about the duration
of your flight.

03:54.777 --> 03:55.877
Good day.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.412
Well, there goes
my opening question

03:57.413 --> 03:59.147
about how long your flight was.

03:59.148 --> 04:00.148
It was eight hours.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.516
Yeah, no, I got that.

04:01.517 --> 04:02.617
I was joking, sorry.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.186
It must have got lost
in translation.

04:04.187 --> 04:05.754
No, we understand you perfectly.

04:05.755 --> 04:07.322
Everyone in Sweden
speaks English.

04:07.323 --> 04:09.725
We also speak Norwegian,
Dutch, German,

04:09.726 --> 04:11.293
French, Russian, and Finnish.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.394
But not Danish.

04:12.395 --> 04:14.229
That is a garbage language
for garbage people.

04:14.230 --> 04:15.464
- Yeah.
- Oh, word up.

04:15.465 --> 04:17.466
Well, I have almost
memorized "Gangnam Style"

04:17.466 --> 04:19.368
phonetically, so samesies.

04:19.369 --> 04:21.403
I don't know this word.
"Samesies"?

04:21.404 --> 04:23.905
From context, I believe it
means "proudly uneducated."

04:23.906 --> 04:25.006
- Ah.
- So...

04:25.007 --> 04:26.341
- No.
- Where's our prisoner?

04:26.342 --> 04:27.342
Being processed.

04:27.343 --> 04:28.610
But, in the meantime,

04:28.611 --> 04:31.713
may I offer you some
of the finest cuisine

04:31.714 --> 04:34.048
in Brooklyn from
my favorite restaurant?

04:34.083 --> 04:35.751
The food cart outside
the precinct.

04:35.752 --> 04:37.219
It's really good.

04:37.220 --> 04:38.486
Hm, none for Soren.

04:38.521 --> 04:41.123
He's allergic to lactose,
gluten, and tomato ketchup.

04:41.124 --> 04:42.891
- Oh.
- Also, none for Agneta.

04:42.892 --> 04:45.327
She and her husband are trying
to have another baby,

04:45.328 --> 04:48.195
so she can't eat anything
that will alter her cervical pH.

04:48.231 --> 04:49.364
Oh.

04:49.365 --> 04:50.731
You guys are real close, huh?

04:50.767 --> 04:52.834
In Sweden, we believe
for a proper team to function,

04:52.835 --> 04:55.035
partners must be completely open
with each other.

04:55.071 --> 04:56.872
Yeah.
We have no secrets.

04:56.873 --> 04:58.140
Not even our bodies.

04:58.141 --> 04:59.640
We sauna together all the time.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.576
Yeah, well,
we are also very close.

05:01.577 --> 05:03.378
One time, Rosa saw me
in my bathing suit.

05:03.379 --> 05:04.880
No, I didn't, you told
me to turn around.

05:04.881 --> 05:06.615
- Yeah.
- Well, uh, since we cannot eat

05:06.616 --> 05:07.882
your disgusting street food,

05:07.917 --> 05:09.951
could you please check if
our prisoner has been processed?

05:09.952 --> 05:11.553
Yeah, we don't mean
to offend, it's just

05:11.554 --> 05:13.688
this place is filthy and you
both seem unprofessional.

05:13.689 --> 05:14.922
Unprofessional?

05:14.957 --> 05:16.691
Well, we were going
to take you to our favorite

05:16.692 --> 05:20.294
laser tag place, but now,
you're officially uninvited.

05:20.329 --> 05:22.798
Rosa.

05:22.799 --> 05:24.833
Ah, Boyle. Just the man
we were looking for.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.435
Kevin has accepted
a fellowship to teach

05:26.436 --> 05:28.003
at the Sorbonne
for the next six months.

05:28.004 --> 05:29.604
Oh, I love Paris.

05:29.605 --> 05:32.574
At least how it's represented
in the movie "Ratatouille."

05:32.575 --> 05:34.476
- Uh...
- The rodent chef.

05:34.477 --> 05:35.954
Ah, yes.
Farfetched.

05:35.978 --> 05:37.479
Anyway, Kevin and I belong

05:37.480 --> 05:39.815
to the Park Slope Racquet Club,
where we've established

05:39.816 --> 05:41.583
a squash doubles dynasty.

05:41.584 --> 05:43.919
We've taken home the trophy
two years in a row.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.921
Unfortunately, I'll be flying
to Paris this year

05:45.922 --> 05:47.088
during the tournament.

05:47.089 --> 05:48.890
It's a seven-hour flight.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.969
I remember you told me
you played in college.

05:50.993 --> 05:53.595
Three-time intramural
champion at Sarah Lawrence.

05:53.596 --> 05:55.831
Would have been four,
but senior year I played Greaseball

05:55.832 --> 05:57.933
in our school's production
of "Starlight Express."

05:57.934 --> 05:59.568
Interesting casting.

05:59.569 --> 06:01.770
In any case, I would be honored
if you would take my place

06:01.771 --> 06:03.404
so that Raymond
could make it a treble.

06:03.439 --> 06:05.973
Absolutely!
I would love to do that!

06:06.008 --> 06:07.342
- Great.
- <i>Formidable.</i>

06:07.343 --> 06:08.376
Yup!

06:08.377 --> 06:11.012
That is great.
This is great.

06:11.013 --> 06:13.081
- This is terrible.
- Why?

06:13.082 --> 06:15.116
You always said you wanted
more face time with Holt.

06:15.117 --> 06:16.151
No, not like this.

06:16.152 --> 06:18.153
Squash brings out
my competitive side.

06:18.154 --> 06:21.022
Breaking racquets, cursing,
excessive mooning.

06:21.023 --> 06:22.791
One time, just to
psych a guy out,

06:22.792 --> 06:25.693
I locked eyes with him
and ate a squash ball.

06:25.728 --> 06:26.728
That's not possible.

06:26.729 --> 06:28.630
It's still in me, Terry.

06:28.631 --> 06:30.432
Look, the point is to have fun.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.867
So just relax and have fun.

06:31.868 --> 06:33.134
Right, right, right, yeah.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.202
It's just a game.

06:34.203 --> 06:35.537
It's fun.

06:35.538 --> 06:39.574
There's no need for Holt
to see me unleash the beast.

06:39.575 --> 06:42.377
Okay.

06:42.378 --> 06:44.778
That's a strange little man.

06:44.814 --> 06:46.347
Probably telling Captain Holt
how much they like

06:46.382 --> 06:49.050
- to sauna together.
- Please.

06:49.051 --> 06:50.085
They think they're so great
just 'cause

06:50.086 --> 06:51.186
they know
each other's allergies.

06:51.187 --> 06:52.387
You know what I'm allergic to?

06:52.388 --> 06:53.688
- Yup. Them.
- Totally.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.824
And also bees.
You should know that.

06:55.825 --> 06:57.725
If I got stung by a bee,
I could die.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.327
Detectives, I've been talking
with the inspectors.

06:59.328 --> 07:02.129
There's been a development
in the Kottbullediamant case.

07:02.164 --> 07:03.542
Excellent pronunciation,
Captain.

07:03.566 --> 07:06.167
Tack. They believe our perp
may have smuggled more

07:06.168 --> 07:07.735
stolen Swedish diamonds
into Brooklyn.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.137
Oh, well, thank you for the tip.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.572
Have a wonderful flight home.

07:10.573 --> 07:12.613
We will send you the jewels
as soon as we find them.

07:12.642 --> 07:15.076
They're staying and working
the case with you.

07:15.077 --> 07:16.845
Ah, fantastic.

07:16.846 --> 07:19.379
Rosa, could you please fill
my car with a million bees?

07:21.247 --> 07:23.816
Okay, since the Swedes
are rudely late,

07:23.817 --> 07:25.250
let's talk anniversary gift.

07:25.251 --> 07:27.786
Should I get Amy something
caszh like shot glasses,

07:27.787 --> 07:31.689
or something less caszh,
like golden shot glasses?

07:31.724 --> 07:33.157
Still don't care.
How about I get a jump

07:33.193 --> 07:35.327
on our new partners
and search the perp's apartment?

07:35.328 --> 07:37.696
Right. We'll get some
clues, solve the case,

07:37.697 --> 07:38.831
make them look like fools.

07:38.832 --> 07:40.031
They can eat our American dust.

07:40.066 --> 07:41.133
No, no.

07:41.134 --> 07:43.902
Soren is probably
allergic to dust.

07:43.903 --> 07:44.903
Oh, hello!

07:44.904 --> 07:46.638
Yes, I am allergic to dust.

07:46.639 --> 07:47.639
Everyone is.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.639
That's what sneezes are.

07:48.675 --> 07:49.675
You're what sneezes are.

07:49.676 --> 07:50.843
Okay.

07:50.844 --> 07:52.143
What are you guys doing here?

07:52.178 --> 07:53.859
Oh, in Sweden,
we call it police work.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.546
Perhaps you don't
have a word for it?

07:55.582 --> 07:57.382
- I hate you.
- This is our case.

07:57.383 --> 07:58.584
You can't work it without us.

07:58.585 --> 08:00.285
Get your weird,
hairless fingers off of it.

08:00.286 --> 08:02.287
Soren shaves his fingers
for cycling.

08:02.288 --> 08:03.589
It cuts down on drag.

08:03.590 --> 08:04.890
Agneta is my biggest fanatic.

08:04.891 --> 08:07.492
Just as I am a fanatic
of her slam poetry.

08:07.493 --> 08:09.561
- Would you like to hear some?
- Would I like to?

08:09.562 --> 08:11.563
- I would hate to!
- Your loss.

08:11.564 --> 08:13.632
Well, we've already searched
the entire apartment.

08:13.633 --> 08:15.367
Yeah, well,
now we're gonna search it,

08:15.368 --> 08:18.169
and find things you all missed,
like this!

08:18.204 --> 08:19.271
Your own keys?

08:19.272 --> 08:20.272
Damn straight.

08:20.273 --> 08:21.907
Bag 'em, Diaz.

08:24.310 --> 08:26.812
Astronomy is full
of interesting facts.

08:26.813 --> 08:28.447
For instance, here's one that

08:28.448 --> 08:30.782
Hollywood doesn't
want you to know.

08:30.783 --> 08:34.852
A parsec is actually
a measure of distance.

08:34.854 --> 08:37.355
One of the many inaccuracies
in the "Star Wars" universe.

08:37.390 --> 08:40.592
Uh-huh.
And what's "Star Wars"?

08:40.592 --> 08:41.827
Oh, boy.

08:41.828 --> 08:43.629
Maybe I'm getting ahead
of myself.

08:43.630 --> 08:46.131
Okay, let's talk planets.

08:46.132 --> 08:48.633
Jupiter is a gas giant.

08:48.668 --> 08:49.668
So is Hitchcock.

08:49.669 --> 08:50.668
How does this help me?

08:50.703 --> 08:52.804
It also has 67 moons.

08:52.805 --> 08:55.574
I came up with a fun mnemonic
device to remember them all.

08:55.575 --> 08:58.710
It goes, "Every
Individual Gets Crayons

08:58.711 --> 09:00.245
"After Telling His Aggressive

09:00.246 --> 09:02.781
"Little Mongoose Painter
Called Ernest

09:02.782 --> 09:07.352
"Some Lies About
Tiny Panda Heads... period...

09:07.353 --> 09:10.689
"Maybe One Kid Could Take
Her Elephant

09:10.690 --> 09:13.357
Into California, Except..."

09:15.194 --> 09:16.193
Where's Gina?

09:16.195 --> 09:18.196
She told me you called me
a gas giant.

09:18.197 --> 09:21.132
Well, now you
and I will never hook up.

09:23.469 --> 09:25.203
Uh-oh.
What's this?

09:25.204 --> 09:26.738
A little piece of evidence
that evaded

09:26.739 --> 09:28.039
your bald little hands.

09:28.074 --> 09:29.541
A shipping manifest
that was shoved

09:29.542 --> 09:30.609
into the back of a drawer.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.010
Our perp transferred a container

09:32.011 --> 09:33.812
to a shipyard in Bay Ridge
on October 11th.

09:33.813 --> 09:35.047
That arrived over a month ago,

09:35.048 --> 09:36.448
I doubt you'll find
anything in it.

09:36.449 --> 09:37.749
Please, you're just pissed

09:37.750 --> 09:39.918
we cracked the case wide open
and you've got nada.

09:39.919 --> 09:41.920
That's right, I speak Spanish.

09:41.921 --> 09:43.927
Actually, we've got
much more than nada.

09:43.957 --> 09:45.290
Damn it, he speaks Spanish too.

09:45.291 --> 09:48.260
Agneta found an invitation
to a party tonight

09:48.261 --> 09:50.195
at the home of...

09:50.196 --> 09:51.295
Alvar Gustavsson.

09:51.331 --> 09:52.998
The hot blond guy
from "True Blood"?

09:52.999 --> 09:55.400
No, the Swedish millionaire
with ties to organized crime.

09:55.401 --> 09:56.435
- Alvar Gustavsson.
- Yeah.

09:56.436 --> 09:59.237
Oh, that...
Alvar Gooz-hev-vren.

09:59.238 --> 10:01.239
Well, you're welcome to
pursue that dead-end lead

10:01.240 --> 10:03.542
while we got to the shipping
container and find the jewels.

10:03.543 --> 10:05.177
And maybe to celebrate,
Rosa will wear them

10:05.178 --> 10:06.712
to your dumbass party.

10:06.713 --> 10:08.547
No, they're priceless,
please do not do that.

10:08.548 --> 10:09.815
Yeah, obviously we wouldn't.

10:09.816 --> 10:11.016
We were just being jerks.

10:11.017 --> 10:12.584
See you later, jerks.

10:12.585 --> 10:14.583
- Okay.
- Bye, Jake. Bye, Rosie.

10:17.190 --> 10:19.523
Whoo!
You ready, Boyle?

10:19.559 --> 10:21.193
- Psyched up?
- No, why?

10:21.194 --> 10:22.260
Do I seem psyched?

10:22.261 --> 10:23.428
'Cause I'm definitely not.

10:23.429 --> 10:24.428
I just want to have fun.

10:24.430 --> 10:25.797
And to win.

10:25.798 --> 10:28.166
Hey, if we all have fun
and don't throw any racquets

10:28.167 --> 10:31.269
and don't eat squash balls,
then we're all winners.

10:31.270 --> 10:33.205
- What?
- Nothing. I'll serve.

10:38.878 --> 10:40.278
- Out.
- What?

10:40.279 --> 10:41.646
Are you out of your mind?

10:41.647 --> 10:46.684
That was... fun.

10:46.719 --> 10:48.553
That was a fun call.

10:48.554 --> 10:52.024
You're a real fun guy, fun guy.

10:52.025 --> 10:54.992
This is fun!
This is fun!

10:57.463 --> 10:58.463
Gina!

10:58.464 --> 11:01.533
I know astronomy can seem
a little daunting and scientific,

11:01.534 --> 11:03.268
but I have a friend who I think

11:03.269 --> 11:05.936
can make it pretty interesting.

11:08.875 --> 11:09.941
Who dis?

11:09.942 --> 11:11.710
Hi, Gina,
I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.

11:11.711 --> 11:12.711
And I care, why?

11:12.712 --> 11:14.478
Director of
the Hayden Planetarium.

11:14.514 --> 11:16.915
One of the world's
leading astrophysicists.

11:16.916 --> 11:18.583
And he's doing me a huge favor.

11:18.584 --> 11:21.018
And how do you know
Terrance, Space Tie?

11:21.054 --> 11:22.220
We're gym buddies.

11:24.090 --> 11:25.924
Damn, Neil deGrasse Tyson!

11:25.925 --> 11:27.426
How are you doing that?

11:27.427 --> 11:28.960
It's physics, Terry.

11:28.961 --> 11:31.163
It's physics.

11:31.164 --> 11:32.364
Gina, look.

11:32.365 --> 11:33.899
Give me two hours.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.567
You'll not only pass your exam,

11:35.568 --> 11:38.302
you'll gain a deeper
appreciation of the universe

11:38.337 --> 11:42.407
through which we journey
on this spaceship Earth.

11:42.408 --> 11:44.376
Spaceship Earth?
Way to go.

11:44.377 --> 11:46.678
You just made Earth lame,
and that is my house.

11:46.679 --> 11:48.680
Gina, why did you want
to take astronomy?

11:48.681 --> 11:50.115
Because I thought
it would be cool,

11:50.116 --> 11:52.918
just me, sitting around
naming moons left and right,

11:52.919 --> 11:55.886
like "Zorp," "Bong," "Dingo."

11:55.922 --> 11:58.356
"Etcetera," that would
be one of the names.

11:58.357 --> 11:59.356
"Etcetera."

11:59.358 --> 12:01.426
She's gonna fail, isn't she?

12:01.427 --> 12:03.024
- Big time.
- Yeah.

12:03.029 --> 12:04.296
According to
the shipping company,

12:04.297 --> 12:07.332
the container that came in
on October 11th is 34G1.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.333
Cool.

12:08.334 --> 12:09.534
Hey, what did you and Marcus do

12:09.535 --> 12:11.103
for your six-month anniversary?

12:11.104 --> 12:12.938
Keeping in mind, that he's
dreamy and romantic

12:12.939 --> 12:14.536
and I only own $50.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.807
- Marcus and I broke up.
- What? When?

12:16.843 --> 12:19.377
- A month ago.
- A month ago?

12:19.378 --> 12:20.778
How do I not know about this?

12:20.813 --> 12:21.813
Because we don't
talk about that crap.

12:21.814 --> 12:22.980
We're not lame like the Swedes.

12:23.015 --> 12:24.049
Right.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.584
Yeah, totally.

12:25.585 --> 12:27.886
If Agneta broke up with her
husband, she'd probably be all,

12:27.887 --> 12:29.588
"Oh, Soren,
I am so heartbroken,"

12:29.589 --> 12:30.722
and he'd be like,

12:30.723 --> 12:32.290
"What can I do to help?
I'm sorry,"

12:32.291 --> 12:34.292
and give her a big old hug
and she'd be all

12:34.293 --> 12:35.494
feeling better like an idiot.

12:35.495 --> 12:36.595
We don't need to do that

12:36.596 --> 12:38.363
because what we do together
is solve crimes.

12:38.364 --> 12:39.564
You know it.

12:39.565 --> 12:41.099
For example...

12:41.100 --> 12:42.467
34G1.

12:42.468 --> 12:44.136
Boom.

12:44.137 --> 12:46.470
We are about to uncover
a butt-load of diamonds.

12:46.506 --> 12:48.139
Exactly.

12:50.843 --> 12:53.678
It's fish!
It's fish, Rosa!

12:53.679 --> 12:54.678
Ugh.

12:58.636 --> 13:00.270
Swedes.

13:00.271 --> 13:01.672
Oh, hello, Jake.

13:01.673 --> 13:02.973
You missed quite a party.

13:02.974 --> 13:05.175
The blond man from
"True Blood" was there.

13:05.176 --> 13:06.876
- Very cool guy.
- So cool.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.378
Yeah, that's cool.
Hey, this is weird

13:08.379 --> 13:10.480
because I hate you guys,
but can I ask you a question?

13:10.481 --> 13:11.815
If you broke up
with your husband,

13:11.816 --> 13:13.016
would you tell Soren about it?

13:13.017 --> 13:15.586
Are you making a funny
laugh joke right now?

13:15.587 --> 13:17.020
I would insist
he be there for it

13:17.021 --> 13:18.956
so that my husband would
have a shoulder to cry on.

13:18.957 --> 13:21.123
Yeah, several years ago,
Agneta and Lars

13:21.159 --> 13:22.492
were having trouble conceiving.

13:22.493 --> 13:24.795
She didn't even have to ask me
to donate my sperm.

13:24.796 --> 13:27.130
I had it already in
a "Tooperware," ready to go.

13:27.131 --> 13:30.499
Wow, that's...
so gross, yeah.

13:30.535 --> 13:31.835
Can we ask you a question?

13:31.836 --> 13:33.537
- Mm-hm.
- Why do you smell like fish?

13:33.538 --> 13:34.605
Is it hygiene?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.406
No, we spent the night
cutting open

13:36.407 --> 13:39.142
hundreds of dogfish to see
if they had diamonds inside.

13:39.143 --> 13:40.677
- Did they?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

13:40.678 --> 13:42.746
Yeah. It would be pertinent
to the case.

13:42.747 --> 13:43.746
They didn't.

13:43.748 --> 13:45.282
Although, one did have
a battery in it.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.384
What kind of a sicko feeds
a battery to a fish?

13:47.385 --> 13:49.519
Well, while you
were wasting your time,

13:49.520 --> 13:51.388
we set up a meeting
on 14 November

13:51.389 --> 13:53.156
with the man we think
is the buyer.

13:53.157 --> 13:54.591
- Um...
- No, don't worry, Soren.

13:54.592 --> 13:56.994
I rescheduled your cycling
practice for 16 November,

13:56.995 --> 13:58.528
and your dentist
for 19 November.

13:58.529 --> 14:00.730
You know me so well.

14:04.702 --> 14:06.703
Ugh.
Those guys suck.

14:06.704 --> 14:07.804
They're so into each other,
they're probably

14:07.805 --> 14:10.007
gonna start holding hands.

14:10.008 --> 14:11.475
Oh, they're actually
holding hands.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.577
Yeah, they are awful, for sure.

14:13.578 --> 14:15.312
All tall and beautiful,
and you don't

14:15.313 --> 14:17.381
want to know what they've got
in their "Tooperware."

14:17.382 --> 14:18.815
But honestly,
I don't know that it's

14:18.816 --> 14:20.283
that bad that they're close.

14:20.284 --> 14:22.552
- Wrong, it's the worst.
- Okay.

14:22.553 --> 14:24.321
Oh, my God, I just figured out
where the diamonds are.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.589
We thought the shipping
container came in

14:25.590 --> 14:27.824
on October 11th,
10/11, but dumb Europeans

14:27.825 --> 14:29.393
write their dates backwards.

14:29.394 --> 14:31.293
We should've been going through
the one from 10 November.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.329
Of course!

14:32.330 --> 14:35.065
Stupid rest of the world,
writing their date all dumb.

14:35.066 --> 14:37.234
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Okay.

14:37.235 --> 14:38.635
Boyle.

14:38.636 --> 14:41.772
Is everything okay, you know,
with your brain?

14:41.773 --> 14:42.939
Yeah.
I'm great.

14:42.940 --> 14:44.041
I'm having a lot of fun.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.810
Yes, I've heard you
say that 162 times.

14:46.811 --> 14:48.645
You do realize, that if
we lose this next match,

14:48.646 --> 14:50.113
we're out of the tournament?

14:50.114 --> 14:51.982
Yes, but the important thing
is we had a good time.

14:51.983 --> 14:55.886
No! The important thing
is that we win the trophy.

14:55.887 --> 14:57.454
Because I promised Kevin
before he left

14:57.455 --> 14:59.356
for Paris that we would do that.

14:59.357 --> 15:03.026
Do you know why
I chose you as my partner?

15:03.027 --> 15:04.928
Because I'm the most
athletic person you know?

15:04.929 --> 15:06.229
No, because of an article I read

15:06.230 --> 15:07.531
in the "Sarah Lawrence Phoenix"

15:07.532 --> 15:12.436
about a young man they called
"squash's unhinged lunatic."

15:12.437 --> 15:13.870
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:13.871 --> 15:18.008
According to that article,
that lunatic was 27-0.

15:18.009 --> 15:20.744
I need him on my team.

15:20.745 --> 15:25.649
I need you to unleash the beast.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.822
<i>♪ Take a ride on the wild side ♪</i>

15:31.823 --> 15:32.856
Whoo!

15:32.857 --> 15:34.791
You butternuts ready
to get squashed?

15:34.792 --> 15:36.660
"Huh? What? Duh?"

15:36.661 --> 15:38.762
That's you guys
while I smoke your butts,

15:38.763 --> 15:42.132
because Ray-Ray and the Beast
don't even give a what.

15:42.133 --> 15:43.467
We don't give a what.

15:43.468 --> 15:45.068
Unh-uh.
Whoo!

15:45.069 --> 15:46.303
Let's do this.

15:50.441 --> 15:52.375
Boo-ya-kah, suckers!

15:55.813 --> 15:56.812
<i>♪ Wild side ♪</i>

15:56.814 --> 15:58.615
- Yeah!
- Ohh!

15:58.616 --> 15:59.783
What?

15:59.784 --> 16:01.384
You kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

16:01.385 --> 16:02.853
Yes!

16:02.854 --> 16:04.154
- Whoo!
- Ow!

16:04.155 --> 16:06.556
Way to go!
That's it, baby!

16:06.557 --> 16:08.390
Gina, great news.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.394
Oh, no.
Is Neil deGrasse Tyson here?

16:11.395 --> 16:13.163
He will not stop trying
to friend me.

16:13.164 --> 16:15.232
No, but we think
we figured out how

16:15.233 --> 16:16.532
you're gonna pass your test.

16:16.567 --> 16:18.447
Yeah, we realized
that we were trying to get you

16:18.469 --> 16:20.370
to learn using our methods.

16:20.371 --> 16:23.206
We should've been speaking
your language.

16:24.342 --> 16:26.109
The language of...

16:26.110 --> 16:27.677
Dance!

16:27.678 --> 16:31.381
13.8 billion years ago,
there was nothing.

16:31.382 --> 16:33.717
And then the big bang!

16:33.718 --> 16:34.985
Yes!

16:34.986 --> 16:37.687
Now, Amy,
back up till you feel the wall.

16:37.688 --> 16:39.856
And, Terry, ditch the shirt.

16:39.857 --> 16:41.525
I'm ready to learn.

16:45.730 --> 16:48.765
And that's how you calculate
parallax distance.

16:48.766 --> 16:51.001
So you ready for the test?

16:51.002 --> 16:52.102
Oh, I took it this morning.

16:52.103 --> 16:53.570
I passed.

16:53.571 --> 16:54.671
What?

16:54.672 --> 16:56.106
It was nice how much
you guys cared,

16:56.107 --> 16:59.042
so I actually opened up
my textbook for the first time.

16:59.043 --> 17:01.945
Ya'll, astronomy is
kind of interesting.

17:01.946 --> 17:04.481
And I am hella smart.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.883
Then why'd you make us
do that whole dance?

17:06.884 --> 17:08.185
Two reasons:

17:08.185 --> 17:11.188
Uno and dos.

17:11.189 --> 17:12.253
I get that.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.391
One-two, one-two,
one-two, one-two.

17:19.564 --> 17:21.231
Ha-ha!

17:21.232 --> 17:24.434
I guess we are the better team.

17:24.435 --> 17:25.734
Why do people like these things?

17:25.736 --> 17:26.837
They're just shiny rocks.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.772
Yeah, totally.

17:28.773 --> 17:29.773
You should be happier.

17:29.774 --> 17:30.874
We found the jewels, we won.

17:30.875 --> 17:31.875
Yeah, you're right.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.109
We should celebrate.

17:33.110 --> 17:35.111
Why don't we go to a bar
and drink in silence?

17:35.112 --> 17:36.112
Cool.
Sounds good.

17:36.113 --> 17:37.113
No, I was being a bitch.

17:37.114 --> 17:38.280
How did you not pick up on that?

17:38.316 --> 17:39.683
What is your problem, man?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.518
Is this about your stupid
anniversary present?

17:41.519 --> 17:43.854
Yeah, that, and you
not telling me about Marcus.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.221
We're supposed to be friends.

17:45.256 --> 17:47.657
You sound like Soren or Agneta,
whichever the boy one is.

17:47.658 --> 17:49.092
Well, say what
you want about them,

17:49.093 --> 17:51.027
but at least they communicate,
you know?

17:51.028 --> 17:53.563
I've never even heard
your slam poetry, Rosa.

17:53.564 --> 17:54.998
Why do you
all of a sudden care about

17:54.999 --> 17:56.733
every single little detail
of my life?

17:56.734 --> 17:59.536
Because all we talk about
is cop stuff.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.238
All right, and that was fine
when we were 20

18:01.239 --> 18:02.606
because that's all
I cared about.

18:02.607 --> 18:04.841
But we're adults now
and there are other things,

18:04.842 --> 18:06.810
like me and Amy
and you and Marcus,

18:06.811 --> 18:08.478
that friends are
supposed to talk about.

18:08.479 --> 18:10.313
Well, I guess
we're not friends then.

18:10.314 --> 18:11.548
Wow.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.049
All right, I guess we're not.

18:14.418 --> 18:16.653
Oh, uh-oh.

18:16.654 --> 18:18.021
- We're moving.
- Oh, really?

18:18.022 --> 18:20.423
Thank you for sharing that intimate
detail about your life.

18:20.424 --> 18:21.758
- Jake.
- I know, we're screwed.

18:21.759 --> 18:23.359
I was being a bitch again!

18:26.829 --> 18:28.529
<i>All right, I called for backup.</i>

18:28.530 --> 18:30.231
I also texted all of my friends.

18:30.232 --> 18:31.766
You'll notice your phone
didn't buzz.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.101
I think we're in Red Hook.

18:33.102 --> 18:35.436
- We're not on the BQE anymore.
- Nice try, Rosa.

18:35.437 --> 18:36.971
Don't try to kiss up
to me by mentioning

18:36.972 --> 18:38.806
my third-favorite
New York expressway.

18:38.807 --> 18:39.806
Shut up!

18:39.808 --> 18:41.042
We pulled into a parking lot.

18:41.043 --> 18:42.143
Things are about to go down.

18:42.144 --> 18:43.745
Backup won't make it here
in time.

18:43.746 --> 18:46.648
It's just me and you.

18:46.649 --> 18:47.982
I heard two voices in the truck.

18:47.983 --> 18:49.684
There'll be more
if there's a meet-up.

18:49.685 --> 18:51.552
- Go word is "Glurg."
- Copy that.

18:57.993 --> 18:59.327
Flergen!

18:59.328 --> 19:00.595
Come on, is that you?

19:00.596 --> 19:03.131
I haven't seen you
since Blorgenbergen, man!

19:03.132 --> 19:04.198
Who the hell are you?

19:04.199 --> 19:06.200
Give me a hand, you old dummy.

19:06.201 --> 19:08.569
It's me, Glurg.

19:08.570 --> 19:09.871
NYPD!
Drop it!

19:09.872 --> 19:11.272
Drop it, you're under arrest.

19:11.273 --> 19:13.808
I hope they have saunas
in Swedish prison.

19:13.809 --> 19:14.976
They do, actually.

19:14.977 --> 19:16.510
- They're quite nice.
- Oh.

19:18.647 --> 19:20.548
Kevin, there's something
we'd like to show you.

19:20.549 --> 19:21.716
Ta-da!

19:21.717 --> 19:24.285
<i>Ah, magnifique.
The treble is ours.</i>

19:24.286 --> 19:26.187
<i>I look forward to getting
number four next year.</i>

19:26.188 --> 19:28.089
Actually,
we've been banned for life

19:28.090 --> 19:29.390
from all future tournaments.

19:29.391 --> 19:30.458
<i>Oh, no.
What happened?</i>

19:30.459 --> 19:31.693
My fault, Kevin.

19:31.694 --> 19:34.128
I snapped the second-place
trophy over my knee

19:34.129 --> 19:35.396
and threw it in a urinal.

19:35.397 --> 19:37.165
- <i>Oh, my.</i>
- Yeah.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.268
But the important
thing is, we had fun.

19:40.269 --> 19:41.602
Yeah.

19:41.603 --> 19:43.971
So we'll be taking the jewels
back to Sweden tomorrow.

19:43.972 --> 19:46.040
Yeah. Guess you were
wrong about us, huh?

19:46.041 --> 19:47.308
Bet you feel pretty stupid.

19:47.309 --> 19:48.543
Actually, when you're wrong,

19:48.544 --> 19:50.078
that means you've
learned something.

19:50.079 --> 19:52.780
And any opportunity
for learning is good.

19:52.781 --> 19:54.549
Ugh.
You are the absolute worst.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.017
I hope you die in a fjord.

19:56.018 --> 19:57.618
No, no, we are
trying to say we are happy

19:57.619 --> 19:59.287
- to have worked with you.
- Yeah, I know.

19:59.288 --> 20:01.422
That is an infuriating attitude.

20:01.423 --> 20:02.824
Yeah, I second the fjord thing.

20:04.626 --> 20:09.030
Bye, Jake.
Bye, Rosie.

20:09.031 --> 20:10.765
It's just how they walk around,
I guess.

20:10.766 --> 20:12.200
Get your hands
off each other, weirdos.

20:12.201 --> 20:13.434
God.

20:13.435 --> 20:15.436
Well...

20:15.437 --> 20:16.604
Nice job today.

20:16.605 --> 20:18.172
I guess we didn't have
to know each other

20:18.173 --> 20:19.841
to have each other's backs.

20:19.842 --> 20:21.676
So drink in silence?

20:21.677 --> 20:22.977
This sucks.

20:22.978 --> 20:24.879
We solved the case and told
the Swedes how to die.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.081
I should be happy,
but I can tell you're bummed,

20:27.082 --> 20:29.751
and that's not cool
'cause we are friends.

20:29.752 --> 20:32.153
- Really?
- Yes.

20:32.154 --> 20:33.488
And I thought of what
you should do

20:33.489 --> 20:34.889
with Amy for your anniversary.

20:34.890 --> 20:35.990
Oh, thank God.

20:35.991 --> 20:37.091
I got her a boogie board.

20:37.092 --> 20:39.127
It has an iguana
playing electric guitar on it.

20:39.128 --> 20:40.561
She's gonna hate it.

20:40.562 --> 20:43.331
New York Public Library
lets VIPs stay there overnight.

20:43.332 --> 20:45.266
Ooh, that's perfect.

20:45.267 --> 20:47.535
But wait, how do I become
a library VIP?

20:47.536 --> 20:49.270
I forgot to return "Superfudge"
in the fourth grade,

20:49.271 --> 20:51.072
and I've been scared
to go back ever since.

20:51.073 --> 20:54.642
Don't worry about it.
I can hook you up.

20:54.643 --> 20:55.810
My new boyfriend works there.

20:55.811 --> 20:57.645
You shared!

20:57.646 --> 20:58.980
What's his name?
No, wait.

20:58.981 --> 21:01.783
- I don't want to push too hard.
- No, it's cool.

21:01.784 --> 21:04.452
I want to tell you his name.

21:04.453 --> 21:07.221
Oh, okay, just gonna
take a quick drink break.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.222
Here comes the name.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.258
Nope.
<i>Uno mas.</i>

21:10.259 --> 21:11.993
All righty.

21:11.994 --> 21:13.127
Good Lord.

21:13.128 --> 21:14.929
Putting them away.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.730
I have to imagine these belong
to someone else.

21:16.765 --> 21:17.765
It's fine.

21:17.766 --> 21:21.135
Yeah.

21:21.136 --> 21:23.371
- It's Tom.
- I love it!
