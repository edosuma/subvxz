00:00.208 --> 00:01.875
Previously on Mighty Med ...

00:01.959 --> 00:05.875
The Daven-Chase energy transponder.
The ultimate power source.

00:06.917 --> 00:08.500
They call me the Incapacitator.

00:08.583 --> 00:11.959
We work in a place called Mighty Med.
The Incapacitator is a villain.

00:12.041 --> 00:15.083
-That's who these guys came to take down.
-Chase!

00:15.166 --> 00:17.166
I don't have
the equipment here to save him.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.792
We can.

00:22.375 --> 00:25.291
Welcome to Mighty Med,
the world's best superhero hospital.

00:25.417 --> 00:27.333
First I get to travel through a wormhole,

00:27.417 --> 00:29.542
and now I'm in a superhero hospital?

00:29.625 --> 00:31.166
This is the best day ever.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.583
If you don't remember our brother
got blasted and is about to die.

00:35.166 --> 00:38.041
Wow. You really know
how to ruin a guy's day.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.000
Here. Put him over here.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.250
Horace, Chase was blasted
by the Incapacitator.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.834
He needs immediate medical attention.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.667
Oh, no, not Chase.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.333
This is terrible.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.542
Who's Chase?

00:55.333 --> 00:56.375
Him.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.250
Nice to meet you.

01:00.417 --> 01:01.959
He's not very friendly, is he?

01:03.417 --> 01:06.125
So what type of superhero is Chase,

01:06.208 --> 01:08.125
other than an impolite one?

01:08.792 --> 01:10.500
He's not a superhero.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.083
He's human with a bionic chip
that gives him super abilities.

01:13.166 --> 01:16.583
Except for the ability to say hello.
Chase, you're embarrassing us.

01:18.083 --> 01:20.750
What's going on?
Who are these people?

01:20.834 --> 01:23.000
I'll explain later,
but the short version is,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.333
bionic arm, super strength,

01:25.417 --> 01:27.542
super fast, and super unconscious.

01:28.959 --> 01:31.125
-Can you help him?
-Don't worry.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.959
I have everything under control.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.333
Chase will be perfectly fine.

01:34.417 --> 01:37.375
Kaz, Oliver, come with me.

01:38.250 --> 01:41.583
I have a conference to attend.
I'll brief you on what to do next.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.834
Horace, I'm so relieved
you know how to cure Chase.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.291
Me, too.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.333
But there is one minor issue.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.083
I don't know how to cure Chase.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.291
What?

01:52.375 --> 01:56.041
I'm sorry, but I've never seen
biotechnology like that before.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.625
And why'd you say you could cure him?

01:57.709 --> 02:00.834
It's so much easier
than telling people you can't cure them.

02:01.959 --> 02:03.792
Good news, I can cure you!

This is bad.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.000
We insisted we bring Chase here,
we promised he'd be fine.

03:03.583 --> 03:04.959
If Horace can't cure him,

03:05.041 --> 03:07.041
we'll have to figure out
a way to do it ourselves.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.667
In the meantime,
just pretend everything's fine.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.542
-Act confident.
-Okay. (clears throat)

03:16.000 --> 03:18.458
Wow. These guys seem really confident.

03:20.709 --> 03:23.125
Thank you for bringing us here
and finding a cure for Chase.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.834
I have to admit, I had my doubts.

03:24.917 --> 03:27.041
Well, I never doubted Oliver for a second.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.542
He has such a trustworthy face.
Just look at it.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.000
This orange is really sour.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.542
Awww.

03:38.625 --> 03:41.709
Look at his weird, cute, twisted face.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.250
Uh, what's with that?

03:45.333 --> 03:47.291
She has a crush on Oliver.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.667
I'll explain later.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.792
Although there really is
no logical explanation.

03:54.291 --> 03:57.667
Listen, we need to stop the Incapacitator.
How long till Chase is good to go?

03:58.291 --> 04:00.583
Uh... you know, uh,

04:01.166 --> 04:03.500
I really wouldn't wait around for Chase.

04:03.917 --> 04:07.458
Yeah, I think some of us should focus
on stopping the Incapacitator,

04:07.542 --> 04:09.542
and some of us
should stay here with Chase,

04:09.625 --> 04:12.583
who will be fine. I'm fully confident.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.792
You do look confident, so okay.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.959
All right, Leo, you and Kaz
stay behind with Chase,

04:20.041 --> 04:22.250
and I'll go with Oliver,

04:22.333 --> 04:25.333
because he is cute.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.375
So are you.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.625
I'll come, too.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.125
Okay.

04:33.208 --> 04:36.208
Skylar will go with you guys,
and Adam will stay with us.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.083
Ah, cool. What's this thing do?

04:39.583 --> 04:40.834
Oh, that's a reflex hammer.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.709
Wow. He's got great reflexes.

04:50.417 --> 04:51.792
Okay, new plan.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.792
Adam's on your team.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.166
So aren't you gonna do something
to help Chase?

05:04.250 --> 05:07.625
Yeah, um, I just have
to give him a urine test.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.834
Chase...
you're in what hospital right now?

05:15.333 --> 05:17.709
He failed his urine test.

05:18.834 --> 05:20.667
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

05:22.625 --> 05:24.709
Before I answer that question,

05:24.792 --> 05:27.250
do you have any bionic ability

05:27.333 --> 05:30.083
-to tell when someone's lying?
-No.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.750
Then I know exactly what I'm doing.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.917
You're lying.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.667
So you do have
a bionic lie-detecting ability.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.792
No. I'm just not stupid.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.125
Chase needs help now.

05:45.208 --> 05:49.375
But the only person smart enough
to figure out how to cure Chase is Chase.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.500
Hold on a second.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.166
You just gave me an idea.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.875
This is a neuro physiolomogra...

05:57.917 --> 05:59.709
Physiomologr...

06:00.333 --> 06:02.208
It's a brain-switching machine.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.417
We also use it to slice deli meat.

06:08.125 --> 06:11.166
You're gonna transfer
Chase's brain into yours,

06:11.250 --> 06:13.750
cure Chase, then make a sandwich?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.417
'Cause I'm starving.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.083
No, I'm not taking his entire brain.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.625
Just his coj-nitive...

06:20.959 --> 06:22.291
Conga-nit...

06:22.375 --> 06:23.709
His smarty bits.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.500
Did it work?

06:36.583 --> 06:38.125
The only way to know conclusively

06:38.208 --> 06:40.542
would have been to measure
my baseline intelligence level

06:40.625 --> 06:42.083
before the transfer.

06:42.166 --> 06:45.291
But based on my use of the phrase
"baseline intelligence level,"

06:45.375 --> 06:46.709
yeah, I'd say it worked.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.000
So now you can cure Chase.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.583
Yes, but more importantly,

06:54.417 --> 06:56.208
turkey or roast beef?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.583
Dude! Obviously, roast beef.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.917
Okay, I think I figured out
how to find out

07:07.000 --> 07:08.792
-where the Incapacitator is.
-Me, too.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.041
We just have to dress him up

07:10.125 --> 07:12.208
in these red and white stripes
and glasses,

07:12.291 --> 07:14.250
and tell him to go to a crowded beach.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.542
Okay, while you're doing that,

07:20.125 --> 07:22.291
I'll go find Ambrose,
our comic book artist.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.458
In his visions, he sees
superheroes and villains

07:24.542 --> 07:25.917
to draw their locations.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.625
He even sees 'em when they're sleeping.

07:27.709 --> 07:30.458
He's like Santa,
except creepier and less jolly.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.166
Okay, in the meantime,

07:34.250 --> 07:36.083
I'll recruit some superheroes
to help us out.

07:37.208 --> 07:41.083
Thanks, but that's not really necessary.
Adam and I are here.

07:41.166 --> 07:44.125
Yes, I know, but technically,
you're not superheroes.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.542
You're more like
super impressive appliances.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.917
Anyway, we can get the Crusher.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.166
He's the strongest man in the universe.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.000
Show 'em, Crusher.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.041
Not bad,

08:03.125 --> 08:06.959
but Adam is easily as strong as that.
Show 'em, Adam.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.959
(sighs)

08:18.959 --> 08:21.959
Well, guess the Crusher's not coming.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.291
Hey, dude,
you're using those weights wrong.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.625
-Have you figured out the problem?
-Yes.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.208
This sandwich needs more mayonnaise.

08:41.458 --> 08:44.542
Also, it seems
that Chase's chip was disabled

08:44.625 --> 08:46.709
by an excess of negative ionization.

08:47.458 --> 08:51.709
But we should be able to cure him
with a positive electrostatic pulse.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.000
Okay, stand back.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.041
You did it. It worked!

09:03.500 --> 09:05.709
The sandwich is
much better with mayonnaise.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.458
Oh, and Chase is cured.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.959
Check me out. I'm a rooster.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.709
What is wrong with me?

09:20.834 --> 09:22.291
You were badly injured,

09:22.375 --> 09:24.542
so we had to temporarily
switch your intelligence

09:24.625 --> 09:26.917
with Kaz' so he could
figure out how to cure you.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.875
I have Kaz' intelligence?

09:30.500 --> 09:33.375
I don't want to be...
What's the word?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.875
I can't think of the word!
My thinking place hurts!

09:38.041 --> 09:39.834
-(beeping)
-What's happening?

09:43.125 --> 09:46.667
Chase's injury has created
a hardware virus in his chip.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.625
It's causing the chip
to generate protonic energy.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.333
He's stable for now,

09:51.417 --> 09:54.250
but if his blood pressure
gets too high, he'll explode.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.000
We cannot let him know that,
or his blood pressure will skyrocket.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.333
We need to keep him calm.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.500
(alarm blaring)

10:03.583 --> 10:05.375
Hey, is that an alarm?

10:05.458 --> 10:07.875
Are we under attack? What's going on?

10:07.959 --> 10:09.792
Don't worry, it's only a drill.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.000
A drill for what?

10:11.083 --> 10:15.250
Just how panicky everyone gets
when I set off a terrifyingly loud alarm.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.000
You passed the test.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.709
You also passed the urine test.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.333
You're in a state of panic.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.500
(yelling and panting)

10:27.750 --> 10:31.208
Okay, I got Ambrose to draw
the location of the Incapacitator.

10:31.542 --> 10:33.875
I also got him to draw
this caricature of the four of us.

10:35.625 --> 10:39.083
That looks nothing like me.
My ears are nowhere near that small.

10:39.625 --> 10:40.667
That's Skylar.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.417
Oh.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.166
Ew.

10:49.625 --> 10:52.625
Anyway... where's the Incapacitator?

10:52.709 --> 10:54.834
According to this,
he's at the Eiffel Tower.

10:54.917 --> 10:55.959
We need to stop him.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.291
We can use the wormhole
transporter to get to Paris.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.917
We're goin' to Paris? Boo-ya!

11:04.250 --> 11:06.083
Oh, that broke.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.667
Okay, everyone ready? Huddle up.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.000
Where's the Incapacitator?

11:27.959 --> 11:29.458
Wait.

11:29.542 --> 11:30.750
Look in the background.

11:30.834 --> 11:34.875
The Statue of Liberty, the Great Pyramid
and King Arthur's castle.

11:34.959 --> 11:37.667
Incapacitator isn't
at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.834
He's at the replica of it in Las Vegas.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.834
Man, no wonder they call
this the awful tower.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.417
It's pronounced Eiffel.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.166
E-i-f-f-e-l.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.750
Pretty sure you just spelled falafel.

11:53.083 --> 11:56.208
Okay, no problem.
We'll just use the wormhole transporter.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.500
It'll get us to Vegas
in a matter of seconds.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.458
We're goin' to Vegas? Boo-ya!

12:06.917 --> 12:08.500
This is awful.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.709
I believe it's pronounced falafel.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.250
I can't believe you lost
the wormhole transporter.

12:19.333 --> 12:22.458
Now how are we supposed to go to Las Vegas
and stop the Incapacitator?

12:26.667 --> 12:28.083
Where did you get that?

12:28.166 --> 12:29.709
At a street fair.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.750
In Tel Aviv.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.709
All this talk about falafel
made me want one.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.000
Oh, I also got a mini license plate

12:39.417 --> 12:41.083
with my name on it.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.041
That's it. Your super speed.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.250
You can use it to carry
all of us to Las Vegas.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.667
Oh, good idea.
But because we're going over water,

12:48.750 --> 12:50.959
I can't carry
all three of you at the same time.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.458
Can you take one of us
and then the other two?

12:53.542 --> 12:54.792
I can do that.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.250
I'll take Oliver first.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.000
I have a better idea.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.458
You take Adam first,
and I'll wait here with Oliver.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.875
So you can stay alone with Oliver

13:05.959 --> 13:08.583
in the most romantic city
on Earth while I'm gone? No, thanks.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.041
I don't care when I go,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.542
just as long as I'm not staying
anywhere by myself.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.125
I get lonely.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.458
Okay, stop.
This is getting ridiculous.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.333
And weird.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.041
Besides, I think I have a solution.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.542
A jellyfish!

13:39.625 --> 13:42.083
Oh, man, if we had a peanut butter fish,

13:42.166 --> 13:44.083
we'd be all set.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.750
Hey, buddy.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.375
I know being in a strange place
can make you tense,

14:01.458 --> 14:03.375
so I brought you some herbal tea.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.792
And I thought it would help
to listen to some

14:05.875 --> 14:07.750
relaxing whale songs.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.291
(imitating whale song)

14:13.834 --> 14:15.500
Stop!

14:16.834 --> 14:18.792
I didn't even get to the chorus.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.875
(text alert chimes)

14:21.792 --> 14:23.375
I just got a text from Adam.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.375
Those guys are on their way to fight
the Incapacitator in Las Vegas.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.875
-We have to go help them.
-No, we can't.

14:28.959 --> 14:32.166
Fighting is stressful,
and you can't be stressed out right now.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.625
Adam and Bree are in danger,
and I'm gonna go help them.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.500
Now what?

14:40.583 --> 14:42.959
Okay, you go find Chase,

14:43.041 --> 14:46.375
and I'll get the invisible ambulance
to take us to Las Vegas.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.750
But it might take a while.
I forgot where it's parked.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.542
And it's invisible.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.375
Oh, good. You found it.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.792
Ugh. Wow.

15:11.709 --> 15:13.458
I am spent.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.709
When did running 6,000 miles
across mountains,

15:15.792 --> 15:17.917
ocean and desert become so exhausting?

15:18.041 --> 15:19.291
Whew!

15:19.375 --> 15:21.250
Adam might have made things worse

15:21.333 --> 15:24.125
by dragging that giant tuna
the last 5,000 miles.

15:30.583 --> 15:34.375
People come to Vegas for many reasons.
I guess you came to be incapacitated.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.000
And for the buffet.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.083
Adam, blast wave now!

15:43.625 --> 15:45.542
The Incapacitator's absorbing his energy.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.125
Now, with the Davenport transponder,

15:52.709 --> 15:54.875
I can absorb all the power in the world,

15:54.959 --> 15:56.792
and plunge the Earth into darkness.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.917
Give it up, Incapacitator.
You're totally outnumbered.

16:19.792 --> 16:23.125
Technically, you're still outnumbered,
so my statement holds up.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.667
Look out!

17:19.041 --> 17:21.041
Good-bye, Skylar Storm.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.083
Hello, Incapacitator.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.125
Kaz, you cured Chase.

17:35.208 --> 17:38.166
Eh, not really. Uh, he's gonna blow up.

17:43.417 --> 17:44.667
He has a hardware virus

17:44.750 --> 17:47.166
that's building up energy
in his bionic chip.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.542
If his blood pressure gets
too high, he'll explode.

17:50.125 --> 17:53.333
Wait a second. If Chase has
a hardware virus, those can be--

17:53.417 --> 17:55.250
(together)
Transferred to another device.

17:55.333 --> 17:58.625
I'm way ahead of you.
I'm super smart now; I'll explain later.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.375
I hope you're all ready to be destroyed.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.333
I have a plan. Chase, jump off the tower.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.125
Do you maybe have a different plan?

18:11.792 --> 18:14.583
You have protonic energy
building up in your bionic chip.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.333
You can't let him absorb it
or he'll be unstoppable.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.583
He has protonic energy in him?

18:19.667 --> 18:22.291
I'll take that, thank you very much.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.166
What's he doing to Chase?

18:29.750 --> 18:31.333
Chase is fine.

18:31.417 --> 18:34.000
All the Incapacitator did
was remove the virus.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.250
Virus? What virus?

18:36.333 --> 18:37.834
The one that makes you explode

18:37.917 --> 18:40.250
if your blood pressure
gets excessively high.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.917
Like if you realice
that some kid in high school

18:43.000 --> 18:45.709
just tricked you
and ruined your entire plan.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.250
What?!

18:48.333 --> 18:50.333
Yeah, like that. Everybody duck!

19:08.125 --> 19:10.291
You did it. It worked.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.792
Did you ever doubt me?

19:11.875 --> 19:14.417
Yeah, ever since the urine test.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.208
Wait. Adam's missing. Where's Adam?

19:25.500 --> 19:26.750
There he is.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.750
Oh, man.
I'm falafel at hiding.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.083
Did it work?

19:40.166 --> 19:42.875
Please tell me our intelligence
switched back. Please!

19:43.917 --> 19:46.166
(laughing) Check it out.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.333
I'm a dairy cow.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.667
It worked.

19:54.208 --> 19:57.959
Oliver, Kaz, congratulations.
Well done.

19:58.875 --> 20:02.166
See, that's how you respond
to an offer of a handshake.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.750
Not like this.

20:06.959 --> 20:08.166
Skylar.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.250
Listen, I am really sorry
for underestimating you.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.750
Superheroes are pretty great...

20:16.834 --> 20:19.625
with or without powers.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.000
I'm sorry, too.

20:22.083 --> 20:26.166
I guess it's not important
if you're bionic or have superpowers,

20:26.250 --> 20:28.417
or are completely unspecial like Kaz.

20:33.291 --> 20:34.667
Anyone can be a hero.

20:36.834 --> 20:40.041
Oliver, I'm gonna miss you.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.542
You're so smart and kind,

20:43.166 --> 20:46.291
and you remind me of someone,
but I just can't think of who.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.583
Oh, is it Thomas the tank engine?

20:48.917 --> 20:50.333
I get that a lot.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.875
I mean, personality-wise.
I'm not a train.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.250
No, it's not a make-believe train.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.500
It's someone I know.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.583
He reminds me of Chase, your brother.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.875
Yes. Chase.

21:05.959 --> 21:07.792
You remind me of Chase.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.458
You remind me of Chase. Ew!

21:13.959 --> 21:17.291
Hey, what was that about?
I thought you didn't like Oliver.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.625
Maybe I like him more than I realized.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.041
I'm over it.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.792
Bye, guys.
Sorry for breaking so much of your stuff.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.208
The doors open automatically.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.792
Not anymore.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.250
Where'd your friends go?

21:53.333 --> 21:54.542
They left.

21:54.625 --> 21:55.959
Without saying good-bye?

21:56.625 --> 21:58.417
What, were they raised in a basement?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
(theme music playing)
