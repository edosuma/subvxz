03:48.356 --> 03:51.725
<i>Grace? Grace, it's me.</i>

03:53.495 --> 03:55.496
<i>I need to see you.</i>

04:18.553 --> 04:20.553
Please pick up.

04:21.488 --> 04:23.924
<i>Hi, it's Tom Travis.
Sorry I missed your call.</i>

04:27.696 --> 04:29.697
It's me.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.601
I just wanted to hear
your voice.

04:37.572 --> 04:39.573
It always helps me sleep.

04:44.045 --> 04:46.046
I love you.

05:37.866 --> 05:39.867
Jacks!

05:52.080 --> 05:54.081
Jackie, it's me.

06:03.291 --> 06:04.958
Ah...

06:06.061 --> 06:08.062
you were right.

06:12.367 --> 06:14.468
- About what?
- Max.

06:14.502 --> 06:17.638
I got it wrong.
I got it so wrong.

06:21.509 --> 06:23.877
What happened to you?

06:23.912 --> 06:25.946
A car crash.

06:26.181 --> 06:28.549
- I know I look like shit.
- No, you never...

06:28.583 --> 06:30.617
Can I come in?

06:34.255 --> 06:36.256
Hm?

06:36.958 --> 06:38.959
Yeah.

06:48.236 --> 06:50.237
How did I get it so wrong?

06:52.807 --> 06:54.975
I didn't see it.

06:55.009 --> 06:57.044
Max.

06:58.813 --> 07:00.814
I worshipped him.

07:01.549 --> 07:04.585
Don't. Don't be so hard
on yourself, Jimmy.

07:04.619 --> 07:06.820
You know, everything
that Alec said was true.

07:06.855 --> 07:08.422
We doted on him.

07:08.456 --> 07:11.358
Alec and me we're too
much alike, but Max...

07:12.427 --> 07:16.663
Max is what I wanted to be...
yearned to be.

07:20.568 --> 07:23.704
Alec is what I was.

07:23.738 --> 07:25.806
- Jimmy.
- Oh, it's true.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.175
You know, I can admit it, fuck.

07:29.010 --> 07:32.079
When Alec started tearing
into me it didn't sting.

07:33.581 --> 07:35.582
That was what was so painful.

07:36.050 --> 07:38.452
I didn't care enough
for it to sting.

07:40.221 --> 07:42.189
But with Max I saw it.

07:42.223 --> 07:44.825
I mean, the rage in his face,
his eyes.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.163
Hatred for me. My own son!

07:50.064 --> 07:52.599
Where the fuck did I go wrong?

07:53.768 --> 07:57.404
Alec, he was always
the wild one, but Max...

08:00.808 --> 08:03.177
Max... Max understood.

08:07.348 --> 08:10.184
He understood.

08:10.218 --> 08:12.286
I thought he understood.

08:17.492 --> 08:19.793
How am I gonna fix this?

08:23.331 --> 08:25.332
Max...

08:28.002 --> 08:30.003
How am I gonna reach him?

09:04.305 --> 09:05.606
Yeah?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.874
<i>You'd better get
down here, Jimmy.</i>

09:07.909 --> 09:09.910
What is it, Joe?

09:09.944 --> 09:11.979
<i>Just get down here.</i>

09:15.650 --> 09:17.651
Hi.

09:18.853 --> 09:21.655
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you up.

09:24.459 --> 09:26.426
You okay?

09:26.461 --> 09:28.495
Yeah.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.334
I have to go.

09:35.703 --> 09:37.938
- Will I see you later?
- Of course.

09:53.488 --> 09:56.290
It's the OPD. I want you all
to stay where you are.

09:56.324 --> 09:57.991
Look, I'm a cop.

09:58.026 --> 09:59.693
Fuck, I'm a cop.

09:59.727 --> 10:01.295
- Sweetheart.
- Call me.

10:01.329 --> 10:04.965
I know somebody in Vice. We'll have
this figured out before you know it.

10:04.999 --> 10:07.734
No, really. I got a good
explanation for all of this.

10:58.152 --> 10:59.686
Cameras--
just what we needed.

10:59.721 --> 11:02.723
- Hey. Where the fuck is Wilson?
- CI rubdown. He'll be here.

11:02.757 --> 11:07.127
Fucking Wilson! I don't even have a
lead detective on my crime scene now.

11:08.262 --> 11:09.996
- Lieutenant...
- Fucking hell.

11:10.031 --> 11:12.666
I'd like to be considered
for lead on the case.

11:13.101 --> 11:15.135
- Huh?
- I can handle this. You know I can.

11:17.805 --> 11:19.973
You're as ambitious
as I used to be.

11:20.007 --> 11:22.943
Opportunity like this
I'd have done the same thing.

11:22.977 --> 11:25.212
- It's not like that.
- Oh?

11:34.322 --> 11:36.323
Still think
you're ready for this?

11:42.764 --> 11:44.765
- What?
- Hm.

11:46.134 --> 11:48.135
Nothing.

11:49.704 --> 11:51.872
It's just the fucking fire,
you know.

11:52.807 --> 11:55.475
Brings back, you know,
memories.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.845
Fucking memories.
Could have been me.

12:01.616 --> 12:03.550
You want it?

12:04.619 --> 12:06.620
It's yours.

12:10.725 --> 12:12.225
Come on.

12:21.502 --> 12:23.503
The eagle has landed.

12:32.680 --> 12:36.149
They found a body in there,
probably some fucking bum.

12:37.385 --> 12:40.287
We've been getting more and more
of them sleeping down here.

12:40.321 --> 12:43.857
They've been lighting fires.
I saw this coming.

12:43.891 --> 12:46.960
- James Laszlo?
- Huh?

12:49.096 --> 12:52.399
- This is your pier, right?
- What's the trouble?

12:52.433 --> 12:55.001
I'm not at liberty to say,
but I need to talk to you,

12:55.036 --> 12:57.504
your guys, your sons,
take some statements.

12:57.538 --> 12:59.473
You can start with him,

12:59.507 --> 13:02.309
and if you want me you know
where to fucking find me.

13:07.148 --> 13:08.615
<i>Yo. Talk to me.</i>

13:09.951 --> 13:14.054
Alec, it's me.
Call me when you get this.

13:22.129 --> 13:24.231
<i>Hey, it's Max.</i>

13:25.800 --> 13:27.801
Call me.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.612
- Hello?
- Put Alec on.

13:39.447 --> 13:41.815
He isn't with me.

13:42.817 --> 13:44.818
- You know where he is?
- No.

13:46.888 --> 13:48.889
Cath...?

14:11.612 --> 14:13.613
<i>Hey, it's Max.</i>

14:17.618 --> 14:20.453
Have either of my sons been in?

14:20.488 --> 14:22.522
We ain't seen 'em, Jimmy.

14:35.703 --> 14:37.704
Hey.

14:38.105 --> 14:40.106
Lieutenant,
you started without me.

14:40.908 --> 14:43.310
- So, what have we got?
- You wanna tell him?

14:44.612 --> 14:46.613
You know what? Let me.

14:47.882 --> 14:50.550
- I gave it to Fleming.
- Oh, yeah. Very funny.

14:51.452 --> 14:53.453
So now you can report to him.

14:54.255 --> 14:56.256
She serious?

14:57.725 --> 14:59.359
I'm gonna need your help
on this.

14:59.393 --> 15:01.828
Fuck this.
It's fucking ridiculous.

15:36.464 --> 15:38.465
See ya.

15:42.536 --> 15:44.537
<i>Yo. Talk to me.</i>

15:46.073 --> 15:48.374
- Black or white?
- I'm looking for Rufus.

15:48.409 --> 15:50.443
- You wanna play Rufus, huh?
- Yeah.

15:52.746 --> 15:54.747
- He's over there.
- Thanks.

15:57.618 --> 16:00.220
- Rufus?
- You wanna play me?

16:00.254 --> 16:02.889
- You must think you're pretty good.
- Not today, thanks.

16:03.691 --> 16:05.291
What you want from me, then?

16:05.326 --> 16:07.360
I'm hoping you've seen
my son, Max.

16:08.195 --> 16:10.129
Max Laszlo.
He likes to come down here.

16:10.598 --> 16:12.932
That kid? That kid can play.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.368
- You ever play with him?
- Yeah, I taught him.

16:15.402 --> 16:17.403
You raised a good chess player.

16:17.438 --> 16:20.206
- Has he been by?
- I haven't seen him.

16:20.241 --> 16:22.709
Last time he was here he took
me for everything I had.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.801
It shouldn't be
too much longer.

17:26.073 --> 17:28.141
These probation hearings,

17:28.175 --> 17:30.810
does it mean anything
when they keep you waiting?

17:32.313 --> 17:34.314
It can.

17:35.015 --> 17:37.083
Yeah, like what?

17:37.117 --> 17:39.485
- Truth?
- No, lie to me.

17:41.388 --> 17:43.356
Usually not good.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.325
Right.

17:51.532 --> 17:53.900
- Detective Travis.
- Yeah.

18:07.114 --> 18:09.115
Hey.

18:10.084 --> 18:12.018
What the fuck
are you doing here?

18:13.354 --> 18:15.488
Well?

18:15.522 --> 18:17.523
Yeah, I got it.

18:17.558 --> 18:19.592
- Yeah?
- Got my badge back.

18:20.127 --> 18:22.095
I knew it. Congratulations.

18:22.129 --> 18:24.297
I knew they'd be sympathetic.
That's great.

18:24.331 --> 18:26.332
Oh.
Well, that makes one of us.

18:26.367 --> 18:29.502
Well, a charm like yours, how
could they go any other way?

18:33.040 --> 18:35.541
- You alright?
- Mm-hm.

18:37.845 --> 18:40.213
- You okay?
- Oh...

18:41.081 --> 18:43.716
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
- Alright.

18:50.557 --> 18:53.026
Go, go, go, go!

18:54.261 --> 18:55.661
Do we have to be here?

18:55.696 --> 18:58.097
Oh, come on, a little rain
never killed anyone.

18:58.132 --> 19:00.166
- It's so lame.
- Lame?

19:01.301 --> 19:03.669
I used to play wide receiver
in high school.

19:03.704 --> 19:06.406
- Yeah, I know.
- Uh-huh.

19:09.109 --> 19:12.278
- Yeah. You're in, let's go.
- Is that Nathan?

19:13.981 --> 19:16.482
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

19:16.517 --> 19:19.118
- Dad, we're just friends, okay?
- Sure. Of course.

19:19.153 --> 19:21.187
Just friends.

19:23.057 --> 19:24.957
Keep running. Run, run!

19:24.992 --> 19:26.559
Go!

19:26.593 --> 19:28.628
Look, sweetheart, erm...

19:31.565 --> 19:33.566
I got a job.

19:34.268 --> 19:37.470
I applied for a teaching job
in Ferndale,

19:37.504 --> 19:40.540
which is this really pretty
little town

19:40.574 --> 19:42.075
a few hours north of here.

19:42.943 --> 19:45.878
And... I think we should go.

19:47.314 --> 19:50.183
I sort of feel I should have
done this a long time ago.

19:50.684 --> 19:52.618
You know, get us out of here.

19:52.653 --> 19:54.687
What does Mom think?

19:59.893 --> 20:02.095
I haven't talked to her
about it yet.

20:07.034 --> 20:12.071
But I think we both need to be
prepared for the possibility

20:12.106 --> 20:13.906
that your mother may not come.

20:21.815 --> 20:23.816
Yeah.

20:26.587 --> 20:28.721
Do you know how much longer
she's gonna be?

20:28.755 --> 20:30.256
Who are you waiting for again?

20:30.290 --> 20:32.658
- Hernandez.
- Oh. Right.

20:32.693 --> 20:35.394
Right. Yeah. I'll check.

20:48.575 --> 20:50.743
Come in.

20:53.147 --> 20:56.782
- Now?
- How long's he been waiting?

20:56.817 --> 20:58.851
Half an hour.

21:00.787 --> 21:02.622
Five more minutes.

21:02.656 --> 21:04.957
I don't know
if he has five more minutes.

21:06.727 --> 21:08.728
Fine.

21:09.496 --> 21:11.631
Jesus.

21:20.307 --> 21:22.608
- Captain.
- Lieutenant.

21:24.578 --> 21:27.046
Didn't think I'd see you
here, not this soon.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.951
How are you gonna embarrass
me this time?

21:31.985 --> 21:33.986
- It's not like that.
- Oh, really?

21:34.021 --> 21:36.656
What do you want from me,
Mr Laszlo? I'm very busy.

21:36.690 --> 21:39.926
The body from the pier,
I may be able to identify it.

21:40.794 --> 21:44.130
Okay. Are you alright?

21:46.033 --> 21:48.034
If you'd let me see the body...

21:50.170 --> 21:53.139
- Why? What is it?
- I need to see.

22:24.004 --> 22:26.172
Was he found with anything?

22:27.441 --> 22:29.442
Yes.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.142
It's one of my sons.

23:13.854 --> 23:15.855
Do you know which one?

23:23.330 --> 23:25.598
If you get us
their dental records

23:25.632 --> 23:27.667
we can make a quicker ID.

23:43.684 --> 23:45.451
Fuck!

24:08.041 --> 24:10.476
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Alec?

24:11.878 --> 24:13.179
- I don't know.
- Cathy.

24:13.213 --> 24:15.247
I don't know where he is.

24:15.949 --> 24:18.384
Whatever you said to him
last night got him so angry,

24:18.418 --> 24:21.253
he had to get away before
he did something stupid.

24:21.688 --> 24:24.457
He worships you.
He'd do anything for you.

24:27.828 --> 24:31.130
He came to you against my better
judgment to make things right.

24:31.164 --> 24:33.966
And what do you do?
What you always do.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.001
Piss on him.

24:36.036 --> 24:38.471
- I have to go.
- One of them is dead.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.248
What?

24:49.282 --> 24:51.083
One of my sons...

24:54.454 --> 24:57.490
What...
What are you talking about?

24:58.492 --> 25:00.626
One of them is dead.

25:01.495 --> 25:04.096
I don't understand. Tell me.

25:04.998 --> 25:06.332
Tell me. Tell me.

25:06.366 --> 25:08.467
What the fuck happened?
What the fuck happened?

25:08.502 --> 25:11.237
- Sssh...
- What the fuck happened? What?

25:12.439 --> 25:15.241
- A fire at the pier.
- And?

25:15.275 --> 25:18.310
I went to the morgue.
I can't recognize...

25:18.345 --> 25:21.380
How... how do you know it's
one of them? How do you know?

25:21.481 --> 25:24.683
The watch.

25:25.419 --> 25:29.321
Oh, it can't be Alec. It
can't be Alec. It can't be.

25:29.356 --> 25:32.425
- Ssh!
- It can't be.

25:32.459 --> 25:34.493
It might not be him.

25:35.362 --> 25:38.464
Oh, our daughter.
It can't be Alec.

25:57.951 --> 25:59.952
Max?

26:54.875 --> 26:57.710
- Oh, come on, Dad, please.
- There's no way...

27:02.148 --> 27:04.383
- It's too tall.
- You don't even try.

27:16.863 --> 27:18.864
Lieutenant?

27:19.999 --> 27:22.534
- What?
- Dental came in.

27:24.237 --> 27:28.240
- It's Max Laszlo.
- Oh... why all this shit?

27:28.975 --> 27:30.142
Alright.

28:29.936 --> 28:31.937
Cathy told me.

28:39.379 --> 28:41.380
What happened?

28:43.516 --> 28:45.517
Dad?

28:49.923 --> 28:51.924
You need to go.

28:54.594 --> 28:56.328
What?

28:56.362 --> 28:58.397
You should go.

29:01.701 --> 29:03.435
You think I killed him?

29:06.206 --> 29:08.207
Jesus.

29:10.243 --> 29:12.644
Of course not.

29:25.458 --> 29:27.926
I'm trying to protect you!

29:41.007 --> 29:42.207
Fuck!

29:56.289 --> 29:58.290
Oh, hey.

29:58.992 --> 30:00.792
Christ, Travis.

30:00.827 --> 30:02.694
You don't mind if I join you?

30:02.729 --> 30:06.498
You're ruining my breakfast. You
know how hard it is to ruin bacon?

30:07.100 --> 30:10.235
- You don't know, do you?
- What?

30:10.270 --> 30:13.972
- I got reinstated.
- Oh, well, I'll be...

30:15.508 --> 30:17.542
Who'd you pay off?

30:17.577 --> 30:19.611
I heard they ID'd Max Laszlo.

30:20.346 --> 30:23.615
- Fucking Max Laszlo.
- Hm. Fucking Max Laszlo.

30:23.650 --> 30:25.284
- You believe it?
- Right?

30:25.318 --> 30:27.352
- Crazy.
- Mm-hm.

30:28.655 --> 30:31.590
- So who's the POI?
- Big brother.

30:33.092 --> 30:35.294
You're shitting me.

30:35.328 --> 30:38.230
Last time they were seen together,
Alec tried to rip his head off.

30:38.264 --> 30:39.865
They had to be pulled apart.

30:39.899 --> 30:43.735
Those boys have had it in for each
other since the day they were born.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.938
The motherfucker
chops off heads,

30:45.972 --> 30:47.806
so what's a little barbecue?

30:47.840 --> 30:49.875
Yeah, right.

30:54.814 --> 30:56.548
So what do I owe the privilege?

30:56.582 --> 30:58.617
Meaning,
what do you want from me?

30:59.352 --> 31:01.353
What do I want?

31:02.422 --> 31:06.591
I could have ratted you out to Hernandez
a bunch of times. * I had the chance.

31:06.626 --> 31:09.194
Not while
you're banging your CI.

31:10.897 --> 31:13.465
Making love.
It's called making love.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.501
In what world
is that making love?

31:18.905 --> 31:20.405
Mine.

31:24.610 --> 31:27.179
I need to borrow your car
just for a couple of hours.

31:27.213 --> 31:29.247
No way, no fucking way.

31:30.583 --> 31:33.051
- You could help me, though.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

31:33.086 --> 31:35.387
- You know, old times' sake.
- Oh, come on.

31:37.991 --> 31:40.292
If I... bring in Alec,

31:40.326 --> 31:42.361
I'm back in favor,
I'm back on side.

31:42.462 --> 31:44.463
You just don't change, do you?

31:44.497 --> 31:46.498
Come on, I know you know.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.700
Where does little Alec go
to hide out?

31:49.936 --> 31:51.903
Well, why don't I take these...

31:51.938 --> 31:53.972
and when I get back
I'll tell you.

32:04.650 --> 32:07.619
- What do you have?
- Well, there's this.

32:10.623 --> 32:11.923
Where was it?

32:11.958 --> 32:13.992
Way at the back,
under the steps.

32:15.862 --> 32:17.829
It took you long enough.

32:17.864 --> 32:21.533
The structure had to be made sound before
we could conduct a thorough search.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.602
- Prints?
- We're on it.

33:32.505 --> 33:34.206
Jimmy.

33:37.076 --> 33:39.077
I came as soon as I heard.

33:40.947 --> 33:42.948
I'm so sorry.

33:48.521 --> 33:51.389
- Do they know what happened?
- I... I don't know.

33:53.359 --> 33:55.360
Not yet.

34:07.707 --> 34:09.708
I'm so sorry.

34:14.013 --> 34:16.748
My son...

34:16.782 --> 34:19.650
I know. I know.

34:20.152 --> 34:22.154
My... my boy.

34:29.094 --> 34:31.096
It's okay.

34:31.664 --> 34:33.632
I know.

34:35.635 --> 34:37.668
My God.

34:39.237 --> 34:41.206
It's okay.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.275
Please, you should go.

34:53.351 --> 34:55.520
You mustn't do what I did.

34:57.990 --> 35:01.826
I lost control.
I became obsessed.

35:04.797 --> 35:07.132
I forgot everything
that mattered to me.

35:09.202 --> 35:11.203
My family.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.041
I forgot my son.

35:22.548 --> 35:24.749
If you seek vengeance...

35:26.986 --> 35:28.987
it will destroy you.

35:48.140 --> 35:50.141
Yeah.

36:00.353 --> 36:02.621
Alright. Let's do this.

36:10.129 --> 36:12.297
Put out an APB
for Grace Travis.

36:32.251 --> 36:35.420
- Hello?
- Grace. Where are you?

36:37.356 --> 36:39.557
What's the matter?

36:39.592 --> 36:42.160
<i>- Mitch, what is it?</i>
- Is it true?

36:44.397 --> 36:46.398
What?

36:47.366 --> 36:49.367
Is it true?

36:54.106 --> 36:56.274
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:57.843 --> 36:59.577
Your fingerprints, Grace.

37:02.181 --> 37:04.382
<i>They found them on the gun
at the pier.</i>

37:08.354 --> 37:10.355
Tell me it's not true, Grace.

37:12.224 --> 37:13.925
Tell me it's not true!

37:27.540 --> 37:29.541
Fuck.

37:30.776 --> 37:35.680
Most people think Vietnam is the most bombed
country in the world or maybe Germany.

37:35.715 --> 37:37.716
It's not-- it's Laos.

37:38.617 --> 37:43.421
It's estimated the US dropped
260 million cluster bombs

37:43.456 --> 37:45.457
on Laos during the Vietnam War.

37:45.491 --> 37:48.226
Now, that is more
than all the bombs

37:48.260 --> 37:51.696
that were dropped during both World Wars.

37:51.731 --> 37:55.800
Sorry for the interruption. Mrs. Travis
needs to speak with her daughter.

37:55.835 --> 37:57.802
- Evie.
- Mom?

37:58.371 --> 38:00.372
I need you to come, please.

38:13.219 --> 38:15.220
Come on, sweetie.

38:21.527 --> 38:24.632
What are we doing? Mom?

38:25.097 --> 38:26.765
Where are we going?

38:29.735 --> 38:31.536
Cool pants.

38:37.143 --> 38:39.277
It's a very pretty color.

38:40.246 --> 38:43.181
I thought you were mad at me.
Thought I was in trouble.

38:44.350 --> 38:46.017
In trouble for what?

38:46.051 --> 38:47.919
I don't know,
I'm sure there's something.

38:47.953 --> 38:49.587
I'm sure.

38:50.322 --> 38:53.358
Oh, my God, Miranda's gonna
freak when she sees my toes.

38:53.392 --> 38:55.527
Her mom won't even let her
paint her nails.

38:55.561 --> 38:58.596
Not even a French manicure
and that's clear and white.

38:59.365 --> 39:01.366
God, her mom is such a relic.

39:03.402 --> 39:04.769
Oh, my God,

39:04.804 --> 39:07.605
Dad totally caught me checking out
Nathan Jackson today.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.674
I was so red.

39:10.609 --> 39:13.044
I think I covered for it
pretty well, though.

39:13.078 --> 39:15.647
I don't really wanna talk
about boys with Dad.

39:17.916 --> 39:20.685
Mom? What's the matter?

39:22.788 --> 39:25.823
Nothing. It's...

39:26.191 --> 39:29.293
just... you, that's all.

39:31.697 --> 39:33.831
Evie?

39:36.969 --> 39:39.637
I love you.
You know that, right?

39:39.672 --> 39:41.706
Mom.

39:49.548 --> 39:51.883
So are you gonna come
to Ferndale with us?

39:53.786 --> 39:55.787
Right, cos Dad got the job.

39:56.221 --> 39:59.090
Yeah. He did.

40:00.325 --> 40:02.326
That's gonna be a big change.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.031
For all of us?

40:09.401 --> 40:10.835
I love the purple.

40:14.106 --> 40:16.107
Yeah, me too.

41:01.253 --> 41:03.254
How you holding up?

41:05.891 --> 41:07.892
How the fuck do you think?

41:09.795 --> 41:11.763
I'm sorry.

41:12.598 --> 41:15.199
I can't imagine the pain
you're going through.

41:17.236 --> 41:20.138
But I want you to know,
whatever you need, I'm here.

41:22.007 --> 41:25.076
I've always been here for
you, Jimmy. You know that.

41:28.847 --> 41:30.414
Is Alec a suspect?

41:30.449 --> 41:34.018
No. He's no longer a POI and
they're no longer looking for him.

41:36.088 --> 41:38.489
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

41:42.694 --> 41:44.195
Alec didn't do it, Jimmy.

41:47.299 --> 41:49.267
Who you looking for?

41:49.301 --> 41:51.335
There's a warrant out.

41:53.572 --> 41:55.706
For Grace Travis.

41:59.344 --> 42:02.246
They found her fingerprints
on a gun on the pier.

42:11.857 --> 42:14.025
You told me
you took care of her.

42:16.128 --> 42:18.129
You told me you got rid of her.

42:30.342 --> 42:32.677
I think I'm ready to start
baby-sitting professionally.

42:32.711 --> 42:34.245
I'm old enough.
Miranda does it.

42:34.279 --> 42:36.280
Oh, if Miranda does it...

42:36.315 --> 42:39.584
Oh, my God, she was giving
Cooper Abaire his bath,

42:39.618 --> 42:41.619
and he got a boner!

42:41.653 --> 42:43.688
Evie!

42:45.057 --> 42:47.592
Did you know two-year-olds
could get boners?

42:48.594 --> 42:50.895
So where have you two been?
Whose car is this?

42:50.929 --> 42:53.464
I'm not even gonna tell you
what she just said.

42:53.498 --> 42:56.167
Really? Could somebody
tell me what's going on?

42:56.201 --> 42:58.236
- Er... no.
- Ta-dah!

42:59.771 --> 43:01.639
Look at you.

43:01.673 --> 43:05.109
You're so pretty.
And all grown-up now.

43:06.211 --> 43:09.380
- I can't believe you got your nails done.
- It was my first time. It was really awesome.

43:11.917 --> 43:14.118
I think that you should go.

43:17.856 --> 43:19.857
To Ferndale.

43:21.727 --> 43:23.594
I think that it would be
the best thing.

43:24.897 --> 43:28.666
Gracie, look, I'm really sorry. I
was gonna talk to you about that.

43:28.700 --> 43:31.035
I know you were, Tommy.

43:31.069 --> 43:33.104
- I just...
- It's okay.

43:34.773 --> 43:37.408
- My God, I'm so sorry.
- What are you talking about?

43:37.442 --> 43:39.477
Sorry for what?

43:41.580 --> 43:44.382
I fucked up, Tommy.
I fucked everything...

43:44.416 --> 43:47.518
- I fucked everything up.
- What are you talking about?

43:50.956 --> 43:54.759
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

43:57.829 --> 44:00.531
- Mom, please don't...
- Please, please forgive me.

44:03.669 --> 44:05.102
Do you have to do this here?

44:05.137 --> 44:07.772
I'm sorry. You know
I'm gonna have to cuff you.

44:09.241 --> 44:12.576
Grace Travis, you are under arrest on
suspicion of the murder of Max Laszlo.

44:12.611 --> 44:14.845
- Mom?
- Grace?

44:14.880 --> 44:18.215
- and will be used against you in a court
of law. - Your daddy loves you very much.

44:18.250 --> 44:20.117
- Mom...
- Your mom's gonna be okay.

44:20.152 --> 44:22.620
...if you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

44:22.654 --> 44:24.188
Do you understand
these rights I've just given you?

44:24.222 --> 44:26.424
It's gonna be okay.
