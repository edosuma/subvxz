01:01.395 --> 01:04.855
Ous se trouve les restaurant sais predict?

01:05.774 --> 01:08.569
Very good... And if we wanted to know.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.488
Stretch... and lift.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.327
And greet them. And greet them.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.205
And say hello again.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.787
Come on bay, come over here.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.837
You do your Goddamn job!

02:51.129 --> 02:54.841
You tell that mother fucker he owes me $75
for this and to brush his Goddamn teeth!

02:56.218 --> 02:57.803
Fucking cocksucker.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.143
Avoid guys in baseball caps
because they're broke.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.425
And they spend the entire time
trying to finger-fuck you.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.859
Stupid ass.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.407
What are you covering up?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.828
Oh I just have uhh... these...

03:23.328 --> 03:24.328
spider bites.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.164
You got bite in here?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.499
Let me see.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.919
Where? I don't see anything.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.881
Well they're... it's better now,
they were worse before

03:36.425 --> 03:38.593
- Can you tighten this for me?
- Yeah

03:42.055 --> 03:43.515
Do it tight.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.475
Make it look like I don't
eat bread and shit...

03:47.561 --> 03:49.062
Girl I swear I stopped dancing Vegas

03:49.104 --> 03:50.814
so I wouldn't have to
deal with these bastards.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.896
You know
I danced for a guy tonight in a wheelchair,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.652
said it was his birthday
and he was gonna fuck me in the ass.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.739
I swear to Christ, all men
are the fucking same.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.319
Too bad these mother fuckers don't know
I like pussy.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.702
Stupid ass.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.539
- You not finished?
- Yeah, here ya go.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.083
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.502
You're new here right?

04:12.544 --> 04:13.544
Yeah.

04:15.881 --> 04:16.923
So what's your name?

04:17.548 --> 04:18.548
Venus.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.136
- You're real name, bitch.
- It's Venus.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.638
Oh well I'm Jupitor, nice to meet you.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.932
I'm just fucking with you.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.685
I'm Chanel. Well, Bethany,
but fuck that right?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.730
Ain't nobody trying to buy no dance
from no batch named Bethany.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.151
You must clean up in here?

04:36.818 --> 04:37.944
I do ok.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.780
What's ok?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.866
Like 100 to 200 a night, maybe.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.910
That's fucking ridiculous.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.454
You might as well wait goddamn tables
in this bitch.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.372
No stripper should be hurting for a cash.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.654
Do you know you can make just as much as
an attorney if you play your cards right?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.920
So what's your game?

04:56.588 --> 05:01.218
Ummm, I walk around the room
and if somebody wants a dance then

05:02.719 --> 05:04.805
No, no nah... Stop right there,
I'm gonna help you...

05:06.556 --> 05:07.636
Cause you on that bullshit.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.852
This is a sales job,
you have to know how to work these guys.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.897
Don't talk about their job, or
their family, their little kids,

05:13.939 --> 05:16.066
their boring-ass reality,
don't nobody want to hear that shit.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.068
You have to keep it all in fantasy.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.154
Talk about the new lotion you're wearing,
the new lingerie you just bought,

05:21.196 --> 05:22.739
the hot chick you just made outwith.

05:22.781 --> 05:23.981
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.868
You just have to be dripping with sex.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.914
Because once you have a man turned on,
that's when you can take all of his money.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.708
Scan the room, find a
guy, lock eyes with him

05:33.875 --> 05:36.211
and stare at him like he's the only fucker
in the goddamn room

05:36.253 --> 05:39.172
and then you empty his fucking wallet.
You got it?

05:40.131 --> 05:41.131
Got it.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.800
Good.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.318
I'm just waiting for the
next song to start.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.029
And then... and then I'll dance for you.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.740
<i>OK.</i>

06:52.037 --> 06:53.788
Do you want to know what I did last week?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.207
What did you do?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.002
I made outwith my friend Sophia.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.712
Really?

07:01.004 --> 07:08.386
Yep. And she's a... super model.
From Italy.

07:09.095 --> 07:13.808
And... it was really hot because
I've always wanted to do that.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.730
God you look like my wife.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.984
Oh... Ok.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.570
I'm sorry. That was...
that was a bit weird.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.157
- It's just...
- It's 0k.

07:29.532 --> 07:34.287
It's just amazing. You have the same eyes,
the same mouth, the hair.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.165
The only thing different
was she was a blonde.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.420
Oh, are you guys not together anymore?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.465
No. We're not.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.507
Why?

07:46.758 --> 07:50.303
I mean, urn, if it's too personal
it's okay, you don't have to tell me.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.015
It's... it's ok... She died.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.728
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
L... l didn't know.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.564
It's... it's ok. It's ok.
I'm sorry, it's...

08:03.191 --> 08:04.734
I'm obviously not very good at this.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.361
That's 0k.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.114
- Maybe I should just sort of leave...
- No.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.949
- Then come back and start again.
- No.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.117
No?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.578
- No, no don't do that, stay.
- Ok.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.998
Yeah, I like you here, actually.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.591
I was born in New York City.
I love dark chocolate.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.971
And my left foot is half a size
bigger than the right.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.015
Done... Check!

08:35.056 --> 08:36.057
Oh.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.351
I should never have told you.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.232
I know, you should not
have ever have told me.

08:42.938 --> 08:47.944
So, why on earth would you leave
an exotic place like Australia?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.947
Exotic? I don't know about that?

08:50.989 --> 08:52.032
Hmm.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.076
Look, I never really planned
on leaving Australia.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.412
I uhh... l got a shoot out here.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.873
I'm a photographer, and uhh... l...

09:01.833 --> 09:04.878
I fell in love, I got
married and, I don't know.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.340
Yeah... So you're a photographer?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.134
Urn hm.

09:12.469 --> 09:17.015
Ok, well... Maybe you'd like
to take my picture sometime?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.769
I guess this means
we'd have to see each other again then.

09:20.810 --> 09:26.691
Umm, yeah... That sounds like a good idea.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.676
Hi.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.717
Hi.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.179
You look amazing.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.306
Thank you.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.810
I hope you like dark chocolate.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.021
Um, why don't you come in.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.648
Thank you.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.777
Wow, looks like another world in here.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.029
That's the point.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.033
L...made us a cheese plate,

10:59.075 --> 11:02.871
with some strawberries and, um some wine,

11:04.122 --> 11:08.376
I, I didn't know...
if may be you wanted some right away,

11:08.668 --> 11:11.796
or... if maybe you wanted some...

12:17.570 --> 12:22.367
So have you had a girlfriend?
Since, ya know...

12:26.704 --> 12:30.541
A few short-lived things.
But nothing really.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.174
Can I ask you what your wife's name was?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.053
It was Victoria.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.061
How did... she? I'm sorry I...

12:50.228 --> 12:51.980
No, it's 0k, it's ok.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.693
She killed herself.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.406
What happened?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.201
She uhh...

13:09.122 --> 13:13.584
She uhh, she cut her wrists... in the bath.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.797
By the time I got there it was too late.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.425
There was no point in
taking her to the hospital.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.804
She was very depressed.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.934
Ya know she would... she would go to bed
early, she would sleep all the time, ya know?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.937
We wouldn't talk at dinner.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.525
She stopped doing the things
she sort of loved to do.

13:39.277 --> 13:44.991
She quit her job and...
and in a way it felt like she quit me...

13:48.411 --> 13:53.958
Like I'd come home from work and...
there she'd be... in a white slip,

13:55.084 --> 13:56.377
with a book in her hand,

13:57.128 --> 13:58.755
but not really reading it...

14:03.509 --> 14:06.387
Ya know, so we ya know,
went to a couples therapy they,

14:06.429 --> 14:08.639
they diagonosed her with depression.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.186
And then I got a job offer in Madrid.

14:16.647 --> 14:23.071
And I uhh... l cheated on
her, with some intern,

14:24.030 --> 14:25.990
I...can't even remember
the name of her ya know?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.660
When I got back she was dead.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.499
It's not your fault, Brian.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.127
I shouldn't have left her.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.469
Are you scared of loving again?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.350
Not anymore.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.204
Doesn't even know what you fucking said!

16:18.561 --> 16:19.561
Hey.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.938
Hey handsome.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.608
Whoa...

17:13.199 --> 17:14.199
Babe“.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.705
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
wait a second, wait a second...

17:25.461 --> 17:26.878
I'm sorry, I'm just...

17:28.005 --> 17:30.800
I just had a long day, ya know?
I haven't eaten much.

17:32.343 --> 17:36.556
Well, what if I make you some of that
fusilli pasta that you like.

17:41.644 --> 17:42.644
Babe“.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.526
I think I just gotta go to sleep.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.739
<i>OK.</i>

18:50.254 --> 18:52.715
Hey, it's me. I just got back.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.384
Crazy trip, I have so much to tell you.

18:55.885 --> 19:00.556
Anyway, umm, I've been thinking about you
and I'd love to see you,

19:00.931 --> 19:02.767
so give me a call when you can. Bye.

19:16.614 --> 19:17.907
Red is so nice.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.575
Yeah, it's soft too.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.744
It's good quality. It will last you.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.205
Everything in your shop is good quality,
I love coming here.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.230
How long have you been coming here?

19:26.457 --> 19:27.583
Since you've been open.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.879
And you can't stop me... l want these too,
they're very soft.

19:32.630 --> 19:38.094
Uhh, don't look now but...
that Venus chick, is here.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.723
You know, I heard she was a ballet dancer

19:42.807 --> 19:43.808
In like Paris or something

19:43.849 --> 19:45.559
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and she got kicked out.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.436
I wonder why do you think? Why?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.480
And now she's like a stripper.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.982
Venus cannot be her real name.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.984
She came in here drunk one time.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.695
- In the store?
- In the store.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.113
You should have kicked her out.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.155
It was crazy what was I gonna do?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.000
I can't just kick somebody out of my store.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.877
But that's a really good
gift for your neice.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.131
Yeah, she started journaling and so I,
I want to encourage that, ya know?

20:15.172 --> 20:17.675
I mean, kids these day,
if you can get them writing

21:56.607 --> 21:57.607
Hello.

21:58.567 --> 22:06.492
I'm so alone... Lonely.

22:07.535 --> 22:15.535
I miss you baby. I miss you so.

22:16.043 --> 22:24.043
I miss you baby. I could die.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.007
How is it?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.343
It's great. It's great.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.345
Hmm, good.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.351
I got you something today...

23:17.313 --> 23:18.673
But you have to close your eyes...

23:19.857 --> 23:21.025
Just do it, come on.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.989
Ok. Two seconds.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.831
Bri.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.880
<i>OK, open.</i>

23:58.896 --> 23:59.896
Do you know what that is?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.275
Uhhh... No.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.569
That's me.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.657
<i>OK.</i>

24:11.325 --> 24:14.244
That's Venus De Milo. She's
the goddess of love...

24:16.580 --> 24:18.123
You know I was named after her.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.587
Thank you. That's nice.

24:24.838 --> 24:25.838
You're welcome.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.312
- Hey, Bri?
- Yeah.

24:41.355 --> 24:45.109
I know you said it's bad luck for people
to look at your photos before your show...

24:45.859 --> 24:47.194
but can I please see them?

24:48.570 --> 24:49.780
I don't have them framed yet.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.157
I don't care about frames, it's ok.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.161
<i>OK.</i>

24:58.247 --> 25:00.165
Qk... Cool.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.136
Jesus, they're amazing.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.014
Why do they all have masks?

25:15.889 --> 25:18.851
I don't know. Mascarade theme I guess.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.940
Hmm... this one is stunning.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.068
Thank you. Very proud of that one.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.237
See how she's turning away?

25:30.863 --> 25:34.783
Sort of sad but... l don't know,
inviting at the same time.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.036
Who is she?

25:37.161 --> 25:40.748
Uhh, an old friend, Christine.
Known her for years.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.376
Hmm.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.597
Hey, Bri?

25:57.681 --> 25:58.681
Yeah.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.310
How do you know Christine?

26:06.065 --> 26:10.903
She was uhh, friends with my wife.
She was her best friend.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.245
What's the matter?

26:26.418 --> 26:29.213
- Does she live around here?
- Yeah.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.468
Ok... What does she do?

26:35.511 --> 26:38.931
She uhh, she owns an antique
store here in town.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.349
Oh.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.908
Did you guys ever hook up?

27:03.872 --> 27:07.543
When Victoria passed away,
we had a short-lived thing.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.254
Ya know, we got close.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.925
Ya know we were both mourning the
same person, it sort of connected us.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.845
But I never loved her.

27:18.846 --> 27:22.391
Ya know, it was just something
that happened a long time ago.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.020
And now we're just friends. I promise.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.436
Hey, Bri?

28:10.147 --> 28:11.147
Yeah.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.986
I want you to photograph me.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.572
<i>OK.</i>

28:32.502 --> 28:36.506
What if I turn a little bit?
And face the window?

28:36.548 --> 28:37.674
That's fine.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.514
Something like this.

28:46.850 --> 28:51.396
Let's lose the mask. I uhh...
I don't think it's working on this one.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.607
<i>OK.</i>

29:07.204 --> 29:08.204
We got it.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.165
Really?

29:12.334 --> 29:13.877
That's it. We got the shot.

29:14.962 --> 29:15.963
We just started though?

29:16.380 --> 29:19.258
We only need that one shot...
We just got it.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.385
<i>OK.</i>

29:48.829 --> 29:50.080
Do you want to get some sushi?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.583
Uhh... Got a really busy day.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.172
Ok, I could umm, come back later,
we could do dinner?

29:59.339 --> 30:02.175
I can make you some pasta and
we can have some red wine?

30:04.344 --> 30:06.930
Umm... Got a lot of meetings
tonight, ya know? Work stuff, so...

30:08.265 --> 30:11.268
That's fine, I should probably work...
anyway.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.524
Qu'est ce tu en pense.

30:19.943 --> 30:20.943
Bravo.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.530
Now if you wanted to say that
you agree you would say,

30:24.031 --> 30:25.031
Je suis d'accord.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.576
ExceHenL

30:28.952 --> 30:31.038
If you did not agree you would say

37:14.524 --> 37:16.776
- Hey, how are you?
- Christine, hey.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.486
- So good to see you.
- So good to see you too.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.821
Oh, thank you.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.490
Let's get your coat off.

37:22.532 --> 37:23.533
Oh, yeah.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.869
You're looking slick and slender there.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.121
Oh yeah, wow.

37:42.886 --> 37:43.845
Get the fuck outta my way.

37:43.887 --> 37:44.887
Jesus!

37:50.643 --> 37:51.643
Watch it, bitch!

38:00.403 --> 38:02.906
Fuck off! Mother fucker!

38:38.066 --> 38:40.735
Shit, look at this... What's baby?
Hey, where you going?

38:47.075 --> 38:48.284
Fucking crazy bitch!

38:48.952 --> 38:49.952
Fuck.

41:01.960 --> 41:02.960
Hello.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.295
Can I come up?

41:05.338 --> 41:06.338
Fine.

41:48.589 --> 41:49.757
Can I come in?

41:55.805 --> 41:56.805
Come in.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.524
You wanna sit down?

42:49.025 --> 42:50.359
So, what's up?

42:52.653 --> 42:53.863
I got your note.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.451
Why did you follow me?

43:01.204 --> 43:02.872
Why did you lie to me?

43:04.540 --> 43:08.086
Because you wouldn't have understood,
and I didn't want to fight.

43:13.341 --> 43:17.386
Look, Christine has a boyfriend, ok?
And we're just friends.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.769
Look, Venus, this is hard, like...

43:26.062 --> 43:27.563
I really care about you.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.859
I just can't see you anymore.

43:34.821 --> 43:39.909
The truth of it is...
I'm just over my wife.

43:43.704 --> 43:48.751
I try to be, I do... I'm just not.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.797
I fell for you, Venus, I really did...

43:53.923 --> 43:56.467
but with the way things are...

43:58.052 --> 44:01.139
I need to be alone... Venus?

44:14.527 --> 44:15.695
I'm gonna go, ok?

44:27.623 --> 44:28.623
Wait!

44:33.296 --> 44:34.297
Wait.

44:49.979 --> 44:50.980
Venus.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.784
Venus, Venus... Venus, Venus...

45:10.791 --> 45:12.210
I can't do this.

45:14.170 --> 45:15.170
<i>OK'?</i>

45:19.175 --> 45:20.384
I'm sorry

45:23.471 --> 45:24.513
I gotta go.

45:43.866 --> 45:46.661
Hey it's Brian here,
uhh, sorry I missed your call.

45:46.702 --> 45:49.038
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

48:48.467 --> 48:49.468
Scotch on the rocks.

49:11.073 --> 49:14.285
You're supposed to look at me when you
toast, didn't you ever hear that?

49:14.326 --> 49:15.619
Ahh, sorry, it was burning.

49:15.661 --> 49:18.330
It's bad luck if you don't do that,
so now we're cursed.

49:19.915 --> 49:21.208
I can live with that.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.046
<i>Yeah. OK. Are you sure'?</i>

49:26.172 --> 49:27.172
Urn hm.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.593
So do you think all women are whores?

49:31.594 --> 49:32.845
Only the good ones.

49:33.262 --> 49:34.305
What does that mean?

49:36.056 --> 49:38.642
You gotta kiss an angel good morning

49:38.684 --> 49:41.937
and love her like the devil
when you get back home

49:44.940 --> 49:46.484
The devil... the devil, that's good.

49:46.942 --> 49:48.652
- You like the devil?
- That's really good.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.779
I'll bet you do like the devil.

49:53.866 --> 49:55.784
I gotta go to the little girl's room.

50:43.624 --> 50:44.667
Hey, heyH.

50:45.793 --> 50:46.752
What's the matter, come on.

50:46.835 --> 50:50.673
Stop for a sec, hey, hey,
can you just stop? Hey! Hey!

50:52.716 --> 50:54.510
AHHHH! Fuck!

50:57.346 --> 50:58.346
Stupid cunt!

51:00.349 --> 51:02.893
You'll fucking listen to me now, bitch.

54:02.030 --> 54:04.491
Hi. You must be Venus.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.335
I would have come by earlier but
Brian says you work pretty late,

54:15.377 --> 54:18.088
so I figured I'd give you
some time to sleep in...

54:22.718 --> 54:26.930
Oh... Your stuff... from the house.

54:28.223 --> 54:30.225
Brian's feeling really
weird about everything

54:30.267 --> 54:31.268
as I'm sure you are too,

54:31.477 --> 54:34.730
so I thought I'd make it
easier on both of you.

54:49.203 --> 54:50.996
Look, I know this must be hard.

54:52.247 --> 54:54.208
But honestly it's for the best.

54:55.667 --> 54:59.546
Brian's very... complex,

55:01.089 --> 55:02.925
Sometimes he just needs to be alone.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.677
He's in a lot of pain

55:06.970 --> 55:08.347
since Victoria dies.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.849
Highs and lows,

55:11.391 --> 55:13.477
drinking, depression,

55:14.102 --> 55:16.104
the occasional fling at the strip club...

55:18.941 --> 55:20.192
he's just very...

55:21.985 --> 55:22.985
lost.

55:23.278 --> 55:26.782
And I'm really... the only one...

55:27.991 --> 55:30.160
who... knows how to take care of him.

55:43.632 --> 55:44.632
Fucking bitch.

56:07.322 --> 56:08.365
Fuck.

56:14.621 --> 56:15.622
<i>L</i> 9° YOU go.

56:15.664 --> 56:17.875
He said no fuck you, you put me in there,

56:17.958 --> 56:18.998
I didn't put you in there!

56:19.084 --> 56:20.924
You put me in there cause
you fucking told me.

56:22.004 --> 56:24.214
And I said shit, fuck you, who are you?

56:24.381 --> 56:25.381
Who are you?

56:25.549 --> 56:27.467
Get outta my house! Get outta my house!

59:20.932 --> 59:22.059
Hi sweetie,

59:24.478 --> 59:27.022
I missed you. You wanna go outside?

59:57.511 --> 59:58.887
Hey, it's me.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.932
I just got back, I guess you're busy.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.227
Anyway, I'm just hanging out.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.396
Do some yoga, take a bath...

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.650
maybe touch myself a little,

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:13.359
thinking about you...

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.498
Anyway uhh, give me call when you can.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040
(Bye 89X)'-

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.841
Love, Venus.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.387
I'll call you back.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:27.535
Oh! Oh... Oh... Oh,

Hey, hey, look at me.

I am looking at you.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:04.072
Uh uh, mister, look at me.

Here. Yeah. Yeah that's good.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:18.253
You wanna touch me?

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.466
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:26.094
Do it.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.305
You sure? I can touch you?

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.390
- Do it.
- I can touch you right?

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:31.432
Touch me.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:35.478
Not there.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.108
<i>OK...</i>

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:43.695
Right here... right here?

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.531

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:47.614

What the fuck is this?

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.336
What did I fucking tell you?!

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.022
You piece of shit! Fucking look at me!

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.214
You think's she's 0k?

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:04.883
Rough night.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.134
Holy shit.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.178
She's really messed up.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:11.264
Venus, are you ok? Honey?

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:32.577
Girl, what's wrong with you?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:35.663
Are you ok? Venus?

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.335
Venus, look at me.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:44.129

Hey... Hey! Hey,

Alright, I'm get her outta here,

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:03.608

Alright, I got it.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:08.613

I just, I just wanted to call.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:32.739
I was thinking about you.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.700
I miss you.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.871
I miss you too, Brian.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:42.789
What are you doing?

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:45.585
Drinking.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.964

I just... l just can't hold on
to anything that's good.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.563
You're not a piece of shit, Brian,

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.566
you're just... you're just really hurting.

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.486
You've been through so much, you know?

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.867
She uhh... she didn't even
leave a goddamn note.

01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:21.912
I know..

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.591
I don't think you should
be alone right now.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:26.793
Let me come and see you.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.505
<i>L.</i>

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:34.008
I wanted to love you, Venus.

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:35.759
I know...

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.888
Nobody's ever loved me
the way that you have...

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.977
I'm gonna come by and uhh,

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.229

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:47.689

<i>OK.</i>

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.530
OK.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:00.534
<i>OK.</i>

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:19.053
Open the fucking door, bitch!

Open the fucking door, bitch!
Get the fuck here!

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:30.648
You're gonna pay for what you did.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:35.236
Get the fuck out here right now, bitch!

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:17.444
I'm gonna see you, on the
moon, and I don't care!

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:28.372
Light in your face... and I don't

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:38.424
You kill my fucking cat?!
What the fuck's wrong with you?!

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.301
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...
fuck, fuck, fuck...

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.827
Pull over! Get out of the fucking car!

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.580
Get out you little bitch!
Get the fuck out of the car!

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:10.747
What are you doing?

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:39.402
Gaahhhh, fucking bitch! Fucking bitch!

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:44.323
Fuck. You wanna do this?

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:45.533
You wanna fucking do this?

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:46.909
We're gonna do this.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.463
That's a good girl.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.487
Get out of the fucking car!

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:26.032
I said get out of the fucking car
you piece of shit!

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:28.951
What the fuck is wrong with

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.228
Fuck.

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:44.235
Hi, I'm leaving in five

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.362
Venus, look I've been
trying to call you, ok?

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.594
I shouldn't have agreed to you
coming over in the first place.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:52.994
It's just... it just wasn't a good idea.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:56.914
Venus look, I just can't do this, ok?

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:57.832
Brian

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:00.418
No, Venus listen to me.
I know you're hurting.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:03.129
You're fucking being selfish, 0k?

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:04.881
This isn't about your feelings.

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.383
You wish things were different, fucking...

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.176
I wish things were different.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.011
Brian please.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.638
I wish Victoria didn't fucking kill herself
but she did.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:17.643
My wife killed herself
and I miss her every single fucking day!

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.021
I just... l just need you to go away.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.272
I just need to be alone.

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.608
Please Venus, just leave me alone.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.026
- Hey.
- Hey, I need a favor.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:02.122
Hey it's Cha...

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:16.136
Hey.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100
I'm here.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.730
Venus? Venus?

01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:28.314
Earth to Venus.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.008
You performing live tonight, bitch?

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.807
The fuck you gonna do with this?

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.312
You thinking about going blonde?

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.161
I see that for you.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.706
Hey? Venus?

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.835
Girl, what's wrong with you?
Did you take something?

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.254
Venus, talk to me girl, what's wrong?

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.925
Alright, come on, we'll sit down,
smoke a fag and calm down,

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:56.135
wait, where you going?

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:57.343
To see Brian.

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:58.678
Dressed like that?

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:01.891
Girl seriously, this guy got you upset
and you're acting stupid.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.259
No man should have you're head
all messed up like that.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:06.572
Come on Venus you remember what I told you?

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.522
Venus? Venus?

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.818
Never date a man you meet at the fucking
club, got your head all fucked up.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:15.196
He dated your ass for months,
he made you fall in love with him,

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.405
and then he dropped your ass.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:19.447
That doesn't sound like a man, Venus,
that sound like a fucking pussy to me!

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:04.912
Shit! Fuck!

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:16.590
911, where is your emergency?

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.232
Yeah, I'm in an apartment and there,
and there's a dead body here.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:21.679
Ok mam, I need you to slow down
and I need you to tell me exactly...

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.597
I know who did it, her name is Venus.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.766
She just left and I know where she's going.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.351
Don't move!

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.397
You're under arrest! Freeze!

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:40.567
Brian! Brian! No! Brian!

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.015
What happened in Paris?

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:17.395
What do you mean?

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.190
Well you were dancing
at the Paris ballet studio...

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:23.716
Can you tell me what happened there?

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.614
I was dancing in a show.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:33.954
But you were removed from the company.
Do you remember why?

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.048
I'm looking at an article here,

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.050
and it says,

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.179
a Sterling ballet school
alum, Venus Noella,

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:54.892
has allegedly pushed fellow ballet dancer
Thomas Pagan down a flight of stairs

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:58.437
at the Paris ballet studio
following the evening's performance.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.939
Thomas is currently in intensive care

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:05.861
and is speculated to be paralyzed
from the wasit down.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:14.320
Now, I uhh, I understand no charges
were filed due to lack of evidence.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.498
When did you last speak to Doctor Kardash?

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:24.254
I just want to talk to Brian.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.345
I have someone waiting outside.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.473
I'd like to bring them in now.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.566
Please come in.

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:24.523
Venus? Have you ever met this woman?

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:28.943
Yes.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.908
No... Venus, we've never met.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.585
You followed me, to the desert.

01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:49.590
I was never in the desert with you.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:07.357
You're still fucking Brian, aren't you?

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:11.444
No.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.490
I saw you...

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:18.327
fucking him, in his house.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:27.544
I have a boyfriend... l
would never cheat on him.

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:31.924
I don't know what you saw.

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:43.143
The last time I saw Brian,
we were having dinner.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:49.983
He told me he was seeing someone,
but he wanted to end it.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:24:00.494
And then l... got home from work the
next night. The doorbell rings.

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:04.915
That's when I found my cat.

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:11.338
And then shortly after,
a detective shows up at my door

01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:15.217
saying a woman named Venus was arrested,

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:17.928
claiming that she killed me.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:24.268
That's when I found out what happened.

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:29.147
And that's why I'm here.

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:41.076
Because I want you to know what you did.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:45.496
Venus?

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:48.541
Venus?

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:50.210
When you were arrested,

01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:53.964
you were found inside Brian's house,

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.046
what were you doing there?

01:24:58.468 --> 01:24:59.845
I was with Brian.

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:03.932
We were... we were making love.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:09.354
No. You were alone.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:27.039
I need you to look at this photograph now.

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:34.170
Venus?

01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:05.827
Venus, Venus!

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.121
Venus... Venus!

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:16.045
I can't do this.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:19.465
<i>OK'?</i>

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:24.387
I'm sorry...

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.225
I gotta go.
