15:50.282 --> 15:52.184
You were right
about everything.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.686
[knocking]

16:00.993 --> 16:02.895
Where did you argue with Javi?

16:04.463 --> 16:05.998
The night he passed away,
you told me

16:06.065 --> 16:06.398
you argued about Sandra's bike.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.567
Where?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.452
Javi found the tunnel, Mario.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.558
He died looking
for his sister.

16:47.706 --> 16:48.774
Come on.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.482
JAVI: Come on, Alvaro.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.918
[electrical zapping]

17:10.929 --> 17:12.131
JAVI: Let's split up.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.889
[water dripping]

18:14.226 --> 18:15.761
[sighs]

18:57.302 --> 18:58.871
ALVARO: Hey, guys!

19:10.649 --> 19:11.650
What are we supposed
to be looking at?

19:11.717 --> 19:14.119
ALVARO: That's a stereoscopic
picture.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.455
ZETA: In English, smartass.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.323
By taking two images
interlaced,

19:18.390 --> 19:20.959
our brains can create
a single 3D image.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.167
Can't you see
an image popping out?

19:30.802 --> 19:33.038
Try to cross your eyes,
sometimes that works.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.349
QUINO: [exhales sharply]
Wicked!

19:45.851 --> 19:46.952
Come on.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.024
MARIO: What are you thinking?

20:28.594 --> 20:30.529
Do you remember
I took a criminology course

20:30.596 --> 20:32.798
- in Valencia with Samuel?
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.935
They always say a detective
must think like criminals do,

20:37.002 --> 20:38.670
do what criminals do.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.844
That guy knew that
there was a tunnel there.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.347
I'm sure he knew about
the freezer chest too.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.515
There are tunnels like that
all over the coast.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.784
Exactly.
He knew the coast well.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.586
I'm sure he knew that was
the best option

20:54.686 --> 20:56.655
to take the girls.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.390
But the cliff at Paraiso
is filled

20:58.490 --> 20:59.992
with rocks and boulders.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.027
Even I've scraped up my boat
one of those nights

21:02.127 --> 21:03.729
when you can see nothing.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.270
Wasn't there a blue moon
that night?

21:12.504 --> 21:14.706
Yes.
Actually, the party at Paraiso

21:14.806 --> 21:16.375
had a full moon.
Why?

21:16.441 --> 21:18.410
Because there's only two
of those nights each year.

21:19.645 --> 21:22.247
- With lots of visibility.
- Right.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.849
If you want to take
a small boat

21:23.915 --> 21:26.718
into a place like that
and kidnap three girls,

21:26.785 --> 21:28.854
that night was absolutely
perfect.

21:30.255 --> 21:31.490
He's not just from town.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.693
He's also a seaman.

21:35.694 --> 21:39.064
He knew her.
He knew Sandra.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.334
Yes, he knew all three.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.560
Are you going to the library?

22:08.627 --> 22:10.562
Yeah, I came to take
the jacket for Olivia.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.197
Mm, it's right there.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.176
- Isidro?
- Yes?

22:27.813 --> 22:29.047
Did you prepare my mother?

22:30.716 --> 22:32.050
Mm-hmm.

22:34.553 --> 22:35.587
How did she die?

22:40.992 --> 22:43.628
- They didn't tell you?
- I know it was an accident,

22:43.729 --> 22:45.931
but my father resists
to talk about that topic.

22:45.997 --> 22:47.966
There isn't much to say.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.568
The accident was terrible.

22:53.238 --> 22:54.639
What was she like?

22:56.975 --> 23:00.412
Beautiful.
Very much.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.047
You must have
seen photos, right?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.516
- Mm-hmm.
- They both were.

23:05.984 --> 23:07.252
Who were?

23:07.319 --> 23:09.388
Javi Merino's mother.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.790
I prepared them both.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.358
You didn't know?

23:14.960 --> 23:18.864
It was very sad.
Two young women.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.532
Such good friends.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.834
It's a coincidence
they died on the same day.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.636
The day Javi was born.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.474
Tell Olivia
not to stay out late.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.266
[upbeat Latin music playing]

23:59.237 --> 24:01.673
AURELIA: I'll do it.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.608
Ah!
I'll do it, for Christ sakes!

24:03.675 --> 24:05.911
Stop it, Nana,
you always do this.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.345
- I'll do it.
- What were you doing?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.448
Nothing, I was talking
to your dad.

24:09.514 --> 24:13.185
I'm sorry, Los Manolos?
[laughing]

24:13.285 --> 24:14.553
Wait, what is that?

24:14.653 --> 24:16.655
- Red on your cheek.
- On my cheek?

24:17.756 --> 24:19.558
I must have
hit something earlier.

24:21.326 --> 24:23.128
But I didn't notice before.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.135
Come on, I'll catch you later.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.438
But you spent all day
rambling about going.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.207
Yes, yes, but it's all right.

24:35.273 --> 24:36.641
I need you to leave this book
on the tables in the back.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.211
But why would I leave it?

24:39.277 --> 24:40.512
Do you know which tables?

24:40.612 --> 24:42.214
Where the history books are,
okay?

24:42.280 --> 24:43.448
Get going, fly.

24:43.515 --> 24:44.850
Come on, hurry, girls.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.117
Hey!
[scoffs]

24:46.184 --> 24:48.386
- Olivia?
- What?

24:48.487 --> 24:49.988
Don't let anyone
see you get in.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.090
- But why?
- Do as I told you.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.959
- Fly, girls!
- Fine, but you're nuts.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.030
- So are you.
- [scoffs]

25:01.032 --> 25:02.834
[door opens]

25:06.471 --> 25:07.973
[door closes]

25:08.039 --> 25:10.275
[creaking]

25:24.523 --> 25:25.924
[sighs]

26:36.094 --> 26:37.329
[coughing]

26:53.945 --> 26:55.447
OLIVIA: Let's go.

27:01.987 --> 27:04.322
Why did your grandma
ask you to do this?

27:04.389 --> 27:07.325
Don't try to decipher her.
Just forget it.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.960
Thinking makes me hungry.

27:09.027 --> 27:10.595
Let's go get
some churros.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.013
[door closes]

28:18.196 --> 28:19.564
This is what
we always wanted.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.199
It is what you wanted.

28:22.734 --> 28:23.368
Don't you wanna be with me?

28:23.435 --> 28:25.804
[sighs]

28:28.073 --> 28:30.675
I would give my life...

28:30.742 --> 28:32.911
to be able to build
a family with you.

28:33.011 --> 28:35.747
- We can't do it here.
- But we can move out.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.084
It's a big world out there.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.053
There's no place
for the ones

28:42.120 --> 28:43.321
who are like me, Aurelia.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.323
Your place is with me,
you know.

28:46.691 --> 28:49.227
Doesn't matter where.

28:54.199 --> 28:56.000
They defend and protect
each other.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.104
They have power, so we could
finally have the life

28:59.204 --> 29:00.438
we've hoped for.

29:03.608 --> 29:06.111
At what price?

29:07.512 --> 29:08.513
Hm?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.785
I don't like this.

29:16.354 --> 29:17.889
I do not like them.

29:17.956 --> 29:19.891
[sobbing]

29:21.025 --> 29:22.694
Sorry, but I do.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.958
[high-pitch ringing]

30:10.608 --> 30:12.043
ALVARO: So, how do you kill
a zombie then?

30:12.110 --> 30:13.111
- With silver bullets?
QUINO: No.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.814
That is for werewolves
and vampires.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.283
With zombies, you have
to smash their brains out.

30:18.349 --> 30:20.919
- Bats, kitanas, crossbows.
- [creaking]

30:20.985 --> 30:23.454
Even one of your vinyls
would work.

30:23.521 --> 30:25.523
But they don't cut.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.725
[laughing]
Just listening to that stuff.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.495
- [chuckles]
- Especially OBK's.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.910
You know it too well
for hating it so much.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.813
You got me there.
Motherfucker.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.091
[creaking]

31:02.927 --> 31:04.095
Al?

31:11.669 --> 31:12.871
Damn it!

31:14.205 --> 31:16.808
MAN: [chuckles]
You serious, man?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.676
MORTE: I already talked
to your dad about it.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.912
Even to that Chinese cop
from Madrid.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.448
PAULA: I know,
but this is personal.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.384
MORTE: What do you wanna know?

31:27.518 --> 31:30.154
You said no boat
went out that night, right?

31:30.255 --> 31:31.556
MAN: Whole thing broke up,

31:31.656 --> 31:32.924
and he's--
they're blaming it on him.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.360
Is it possible
you missed something?

31:35.426 --> 31:38.263
I don't know, someone you're
very used to seeing,

31:38.363 --> 31:39.831
you didn't find it unordinary?

31:41.766 --> 31:43.201
Like a local from town?

31:45.603 --> 31:48.206
He knows this area.

31:48.273 --> 31:50.408
Moreover, he knows
these waters.

32:03.321 --> 32:04.756
Do you remember if any boat

32:04.822 --> 32:07.325
was brought in afterwards
for repairs?

32:07.392 --> 32:09.427
No, not that I recall.

32:11.029 --> 32:13.431
Okay, I'm gonna take a look
at the ones at the pier.

32:13.531 --> 32:15.433
There might still be marks
on the hull, okay?

32:15.533 --> 32:17.201
- Thank you.
- Hey, could you hand me that--

32:17.268 --> 32:18.803
that wrench over there, please?

32:18.870 --> 32:19.904
This one?

32:21.706 --> 32:24.409
RAMON:<i> Honey, are you there?</i>
<i>Where are you, sweetie?</i>

32:24.475 --> 32:26.945
I'm at the port with Morte.
What's up, Dad?

32:27.045 --> 32:28.613
<i>Turns out the fair vendors
cleared out</i>

32:28.680 --> 32:30.481
<i>after the storm,
and it's all muddy.</i>

32:30.548 --> 32:33.051
<i>We have to set up a perimeter
for the civilians.</i>

32:33.117 --> 32:35.153
I'm on my way.
Later. Thank you.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.437
[panicked breathing]

33:05.783 --> 33:07.151
[light clanging]

[door banging]

33:33.478 --> 33:35.847
[footsteps approaching]

33:45.156 --> 33:48.326
I was totally sure
that they were sending you.

33:53.664 --> 33:54.732
Ah!

33:54.799 --> 33:57.168
[thudding]

34:10.114 --> 34:12.483
[footsteps approaching]

35:57.855 --> 36:01.192
Al!
What are you doing?

36:09.600 --> 36:10.835
[gasps]

36:10.935 --> 36:12.270
[high-pitch ringing]

38:39.550 --> 38:41.986
[whispering]
It was...

38:44.088 --> 38:48.159
just a touch.

38:57.134 --> 38:58.469
That is impossible.

39:03.007 --> 39:06.310
It's... him.

39:26.831 --> 39:28.032
Are you sure?

39:28.132 --> 39:30.468
[wind whooshing]

39:48.953 --> 39:50.788
[grunting]

39:50.888 --> 39:52.823
[electricity buzzing]

39:54.759 --> 39:56.093
Huh?

40:47.278 --> 40:49.513
[motorcycle revving]

40:51.048 --> 40:52.049
Come on, let's go!
Run!

40:58.956 --> 41:00.424
MAN 1: Hey, you hear the latest?

41:00.524 --> 41:03.027
MAN 2: About what?
MAN 1: Secretary of tourism.

41:03.127 --> 41:03.928
MAN 2: No, no idea.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.530
MAN 3: Yeah, tourism's a mess.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.034
MAN 4: [scoffs]
Yeah, that's ridiculous, really.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.323
MAN 2: And wait until the budget
for the next period is approved.

41:32.389 --> 41:34.592
MAN 1: Don't even go there, man.
MAN 2: It'll be the same,

41:34.692 --> 41:36.026
but on a much larger scale.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.976
- What if that's it?
- Wait, what?

41:52.042 --> 41:54.478
I noticed that that man
opened the bathroom door,

41:54.545 --> 41:56.080
saw us, and did nothing.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.448
It is logical.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.583
The Mortise said they hated
the light.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.485
And now that I remember when
I got attacked by the nurse,

42:01.552 --> 42:02.486
the lights went out
in the basement.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.555
Someone made
that happen, though.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.490
Same happened
at the library earlier.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.292
In the light,
they can't see us.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.562
That's how they hunt ghosts,
man.

42:11.629 --> 42:14.565
At night,
hidden in the dark.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.434
QUINO: Just like Bilbo
when he puts the ring on

42:17.535 --> 42:18.435
- in "The Hobbit."
ALVARO: Exactly.

42:18.502 --> 42:21.205
Those ghost hunter
motherfuckers.

42:21.272 --> 42:24.008
Javi, what else
did the Mortise tell you?

42:24.074 --> 42:24.708
Did she mention
how to kill them?

42:24.808 --> 42:26.076
Do they have weaknesses?

42:26.143 --> 42:29.246
- She didn't come.
- What do you mean?

42:29.313 --> 42:30.481
[phone ringing]

42:30.548 --> 42:32.016
She sent Olivia
with a notebook.

42:32.082 --> 42:33.651
I couldn't pick it up.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.920
It's still there
at the library.

42:35.986 --> 42:38.289
What do we do?
Maybe go back for it,

42:38.355 --> 42:39.924
or maybe go to the Mortise's?

42:39.990 --> 42:42.359
[ringing continues]

42:44.161 --> 42:47.531
How long has that phone booth
been there?

42:48.933 --> 42:50.467
I've never seen it.

43:00.811 --> 43:02.146
JAVI: Is that the signal?

43:03.747 --> 43:05.683
The one the Mortise mentioned?

43:05.749 --> 43:08.586
- The passage to the beyond.
- You gotta be kidding me.

43:08.686 --> 43:10.120

ALVARO: Shit.

43:10.187 --> 43:11.622
What do we do?

43:11.722 --> 43:13.290
Pick up.
What else, man?

43:13.357 --> 43:14.558
But we can't touch anything.

43:20.431 --> 43:23.000
Fuck this.
Let's get the hell outta here.

43:27.171 --> 43:28.272
Javi.

43:51.795 --> 43:53.330
ZETA: What are you doing,
morons?

43:53.397 --> 43:55.332
This is our opportunity
to get out of here.

43:59.169 --> 44:00.571
Are you all out of your minds?

44:01.772 --> 44:04.308
You're getting
yourselves killed.

44:04.408 --> 44:06.076
You morons!

44:06.143 --> 44:07.845
You're dead, assholes!

MAN:<i> Connor?</i>
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

44:28.866 --> 44:30.367
<i>This is Ray.</i>

44:30.434 --> 44:31.335
<i>I heard your call this morning</i>

44:31.402 --> 44:33.604
<i>on the way to Alcoy.
Over.</i>

44:33.671 --> 44:35.773
This is Connor, I copy.
Over.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.508
<i>I'm a trucker.
I cover the route</i>

44:37.608 --> 44:39.209
<i>from Madrid to Valencia,
and you asked</i>

44:39.276 --> 44:40.411
<i>about Charly, right?
Over.</i>

44:40.477 --> 44:44.048
Yes, yes, Gil Perez.
Do you know him? Over.

44:44.114 --> 44:46.717
<i>We've talked through this line
and I see him from time to time</i>

44:46.784 --> 44:49.586
<i>in the hostel I spend
the nights at in Macastre.</i>

44:49.687 --> 44:51.522
<i>Nice guy, that Charly.</i>

44:51.588 --> 44:53.757
<i>A bit crazy,
if you ask me.</i>

44:53.824 --> 44:56.226
I-- I went to his house
and it seemed like he had left.

44:56.326 --> 44:58.095
He took all of his things.
Over.

44:58.162 --> 44:59.196
<i>Huh? So, he left?</i>

45:00.364 --> 45:02.800
<i>Uh, I don't know
if you know this,</i>

45:02.866 --> 45:05.069
<i>but his son disappeared
a while ago.</i>

45:06.236 --> 45:09.606
MARIO:<i> Yes, yes, I knew that.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

45:09.673 --> 45:11.408
RAY: He told me once
he has a sister

45:11.475 --> 45:13.677
living in the Algarve.

45:13.744 --> 45:15.546
She insisted he went
to live with her.

45:16.847 --> 45:19.950
I don't know.
Maybe he finally did.

45:21.985 --> 45:23.654
Are you still there, Connor?

45:23.721 --> 45:26.090
<i>Yes, yes, I'm still here.</i>

45:26.156 --> 45:27.224
<i>If you contact him,
tell him I'm looking for him.</i>

45:27.324 --> 45:29.526
<i>Please, I need to talk to him.
Over.</i>

45:29.593 --> 45:32.296
Of course, yes.

45:32.362 --> 45:34.431
If I contact him,
I'll tell him.

45:34.531 --> 45:36.633
But man, I'd forget about it.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.369
From the things
he told me...

45:39.436 --> 45:41.805
the best thing he could do
was to leave.

45:43.107 --> 45:44.441
Over and out.

46:05.162 --> 46:08.398
