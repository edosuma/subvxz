Thank you. Watch your step.</i>

01:22.601 --> 01:25.444
- Morning.
- Morning. Oh! Excuse me.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.772
All set for the week
going to be busy.

01:27.841 --> 01:29.420
Don't I know it.

01:48.407 --> 01:51.022
- Hi, Patty, hi, Fay.
- Hi.

02:43.343 --> 02:45.889
- Good weekend?
- All right.

02:46.123 --> 02:47.233
Frank take you out?

02:47.452 --> 02:50.217
Took himself out.
He went fishing.

02:52.212 --> 02:54.584
This is where
I'm going to start you off.

02:54.688 --> 02:57.268
Strewth!
Look at that!

02:57.333 --> 02:59.752
I think I might leave you with
these ladies you follow me.

02:59.817 --> 03:02.863
I hope she's better than
the one we had last Christmas.

03:03.256 --> 03:05.684
- Morning, Miss Cartwright.
- Morning, Miss Cartwright.

03:05.857 --> 03:09.230
Miss Baines, Mrs Willams,
this is Miss Miles, um.

03:09.349 --> 03:12.823
- L... Lisa.
- Lisa Miles

03:12.888 --> 03:16.379
she'll be helping you out with
the Christmas rush and the sales.

03:16.483 --> 03:20.105
Right, There we are.
These ladies will show you the ropes.

03:21.248 --> 03:24.408
Right, then.
I hope you like hard work.

03:39.573 --> 03:42.994
It's very nice to see you here.
Have a lovely day.

03:43.930 --> 03:46.002
Have you, have you got a list”?

03:55.900 --> 03:58.716
- Oh! I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

03:58.786 --> 04:00.909
I was really hoping
you could adjust the darts.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.289
I'm afraid we can only
do hems at the moment.

04:03.673 --> 04:05.202
Oh! In the racks over there.

04:05.267 --> 04:07.187
Make sure you arrange
them according to size.

04:07.341 --> 04:08.493
Okay.

04:08.913 --> 04:11.469
Would you have this
in an SW?

04:11.657 --> 04:14.372
Oh, I'm not sure.
It's my first day.

04:15.157 --> 04:17.334
Bloody staff don't know
anything these days.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.023
Don't know
where they find them.

04:22.844 --> 04:25.725
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry, madam.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.250
Ahem. Uh, Lisa!

04:28.391 --> 04:29.890
Miss Miles!

04:30.212 --> 04:31.914
Bucket and mop
please, dear.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.023
In the storeroom.

04:36.149 --> 04:37.282
Where did you meet him?

04:37.367 --> 04:39.163
He works with Myra's boyiriend.

04:39.509 --> 04:41.389
Reckoned he was irresistible.

04:41.454 --> 04:43.039
I have I got news for him.

04:43.235 --> 04:44.867
Ugh, he was all over me.

04:45.008 --> 04:48.101
They only want one thing...
All of them.

04:48.516 --> 04:50.326
Maybe not all of them.

04:51.797 --> 04:52.923
What do you mean?

04:53.001 --> 04:57.078
Onh.. Nothing...
Frank's just a bit...

04:59.532 --> 05:01.025
Inattentive?

05:09.680 --> 05:13.325
Just left school, have you, Lisa?
Done the inter, have you?

05:13.517 --> 05:15.172
No, the leaving.

05:15.329 --> 05:17.835
The leaving!
How old are you?

05:18.150 --> 05:21.969
I'm sixteen...
I'll be seventeen in February.

05:22.603 --> 05:24.045
I'd been working
in the shoe factory

05:24.110 --> 05:25.930
for two years
when I was 16.

05:26.696 --> 05:28.249
Are you going to be a teacher?

05:28.326 --> 05:29.595
Oh, no.

05:30.418 --> 05:31.734
What then?

05:32.564 --> 05:34.422
I'm going to be a poet.

05:34.530 --> 05:35.818
- A poet!
- A poet!

05:37.126 --> 05:39.226
I don't reckon
there'd be much money in that.

05:39.364 --> 05:44.513
Um, well, I mean, I'd like to try
to be a poet. Or... an actress.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.196
- An actress!
- An actress!

05:46.261 --> 05:48.782
Like at the Tivoli?
In the chorus line?

05:48.888 --> 05:52.395
Well, no, no, I meant
more real theatre, you know...

05:52.460 --> 05:56.035
Uh... Shakespeare,
Eugene O'Neill, Moliére...

05:56.594 --> 05:58.319
Violly? who?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.573
Never heard of her.

06:05.284 --> 06:06.867
Mind your step.

06:10.349 --> 06:11.650
Hey!

06:16.094 --> 06:18.234
Good afternoon, ladies.

06:18.422 --> 06:20.625
Beautiful day, is it not”.

06:20.759 --> 06:23.438
How lucky we all are
to live in such a place.

06:23.728 --> 06:28.320
Ah!
You must be the new jeune fille.

06:28.711 --> 06:30.702
Soon you will come to me.

06:30.915 --> 06:34.195
Some help I can use
during this season.

06:36.821 --> 06:38.211
Who's that.

06:38.306 --> 06:40.667
Magda. One of the moreffos.

06:40.857 --> 06:43.311
Refugees. Migrants.

06:43.376 --> 06:46.639
Comes out here and lords it
over us with some cock and bull story

06:46.704 --> 06:49.133
about a fashion job
in Paris before the war.

06:50.123 --> 06:52.340
Tell you what,
she looks all right, though...

06:52.673 --> 06:55.664
Must be 45
if she's a day.

06:56.103 --> 06:58.101
She's older than my mum.

06:58.924 --> 07:01.475
Well, apart from those two
that boss me around,

07:01.540 --> 07:03.469
there's a lady
called Miss Cartwright,

07:03.538 --> 07:06.411
and a Mr Ryder
and a migrant called Magda.

07:06.482 --> 07:08.812
"New Australians”,
we're supposed to call them.

07:08.954 --> 07:11.489
- The other two don't like her.
- Why not?

07:11.554 --> 07:13.977
I don't know.
They think she's a bossy boots.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.961
Bossy boots...
well, I'm off.

07:17.368 --> 07:18.817
How'd you go, love?

07:19.056 --> 07:21.901
Good, dad.
Lots of carrying things.

07:21.966 --> 07:24.491
Good for you. Build you up.

07:24.556 --> 07:26.976
Have a look at you,
you're like an underfed canary.

07:27.702 --> 07:29.951
All right!
See you in the morning.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.961
- Bye.
- Hooroo.

07:38.701 --> 07:40.517
This came for you.

07:57.782 --> 08:01.842
Dad will have to sign this.
Doyou think he will?

08:01.907 --> 08:04.959
We'll think of something.
It's not going to be easy,

08:05.024 --> 08:06.738
put it's just a matter
of picking the right time.

08:06.803 --> 08:07.950
- Mm.
- All right?

08:08.056 --> 08:11.726
Your dad's all right. He...
Sometimes needs a bit of...

08:11.837 --> 08:13.263
Careful handling?

08:14.064 --> 08:15.144
Yeah.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.451
Help me with this,
will you, dear?

08:53.262 --> 08:55.620
Z1p that up for me,
will you?

08:59.010 --> 09:00.405
It's...

09:02.477 --> 09:07.879
Um... I, um...
I don't think it's going to fit.

09:08.003 --> 09:11.759
Oh, nonsense.
I always wear this size.

09:13.501 --> 09:14.901
Um, I don't...

09:14.966 --> 09:16.996
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

09:21.396 --> 09:24.530
- Undo... undo it!
- I don't...

09:25.874 --> 09:28.225
- What did you do?
- I...

09:31.631 --> 09:34.388
Now, now, Mrs Wentworth,
do try to hold still.

09:34.453 --> 09:36.145
You better clear off,
we'll sort this out.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.280
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:38.485 --> 09:39.721
I can see the problem.

09:39.786 --> 09:41.992
- Aahh!
- Oh, Mrs Wentworth,

09:42.336 --> 09:44.694
we've had so much trouble
with zippers lately.

09:44.774 --> 09:47.491
They make them in Melbourne,
or Japan, or somewhere.

09:49.198 --> 09:52.521
- Oh, there!
- Oh, thank you!

09:54.348 --> 09:57.288
- What happeneq??
- The new assistant.

10:01.633 --> 10:04.185
I know
it may be a bit unfair,

10:04.250 --> 10:06.647
perhaps,
we should dismiss that young girl.

10:06.813 --> 10:09.435
Mrs Wentworth will be
on the warpath.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.505
Her family have shares
in Goode's, you know.

10:11.574 --> 10:14.069
- Oh, I don't think she'll make a fuss...
- Mr Ryder.

10:14.149 --> 10:16.076
She'll be a laughing stock
if word gets around

10:16.141 --> 10:18.538
about what size dress
she was trying to squeeze into.

10:18.709 --> 10:22.624
And word could get around,
I suppose, Miss Cartwright.

10:22.689 --> 10:26.022
It could, Mr Ryder.
It could.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.013
You don't ike the lunch room?

10:37.078 --> 10:40.778
Oh... not too much.
It's nicer out here.

10:41.047 --> 10:42.772
Must be a good book.

10:42.974 --> 10:45.490
On, it is...
it's wonderful.

10:45.555 --> 10:48.538
I'm just finishing it.
You can borrow it if you like.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.042
It's pretty big, I dunno.

10:52.089 --> 10:53.241
What's it called?

10:53.367 --> 10:54.835
Anna Karenina.

10:55.181 --> 10:57.897
Is it a romance?
I like romances.

10:58.935 --> 11:00.910
Well. Sort of.

11:01.985 --> 11:04.024
- Come on, we'd better get back.
- Oh, Yes.

11:04.243 --> 11:07.388
It's um, it's by Tolstoy.
It's set in Russia.

11:07.496 --> 11:09.052
- Russia!?
- Yeah!

11:09.117 --> 11:12.638
- You can't read Russian.
- Oh, no, no, it's a translation.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.360
- Oh!
- Yeah!

11:14.610 --> 11:16.529
I'm sorry, but the fact is
that when I got it home

11:16.594 --> 11:18.599
and tried it on, it just
wasn't really my colour.

11:18.664 --> 11:19.890
It's just not me.

11:20.003 --> 11:23.132
I see. Oh, Lisa,
those go by the lift.

11:23.268 --> 11:24.295
- Okay.
- And. Uh,

11:24.360 --> 11:26.344
what about the sales books
I asked you to check?

11:26.409 --> 11:27.740
You've got to add
the totals page by page,

11:27.805 --> 11:29.391
and then compare them
with the receipts.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.670
Yes, I've done that.

11:31.676 --> 11:34.197
- Oh!
- Miss? My dress?

11:34.692 --> 11:40.725
Yes, well, you can exchange it,
madam, but not if it's been worn.

11:41.035 --> 11:42.601
It hasn't been worn.

11:43.141 --> 11:45.960
Very well.
Third floor for exchanges, madam.

11:47.911 --> 11:50.323
- Liar.
- Of course.

11:52.519 --> 11:56.480
Oh, look out. Here she comes...
Miss Croatia 1938.

11:57.826 --> 11:59.169
Ladies.

11:59.489 --> 12:02.416
Today is the day I am stealing
your little schoolgirl slave

12:02.481 --> 12:04.400
- for a few hours.
- Oh, no, no, you're not.

12:04.465 --> 12:06.236
Can't you see that
we're run off our feet?

12:06.301 --> 12:08.861
Quite so, but we are
all our feet run off.

12:08.926 --> 12:10.857
But Miss Cartwright has said
that we can keep Lisa all week!

12:10.922 --> 12:14.175
I have cleared the matter
with Miss Cartwright.

12:14.278 --> 12:18.630
Come, Lisa. I will show you
how we do things in model gowns.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.520
Come!

12:24.056 --> 12:25.678
Well, bugger that.

12:25.743 --> 12:27.846
She knew we needed
the extra help this week.

12:27.911 --> 12:29.767
Typical.
Thinks she owns the place.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.916
Yeah. Typical.

12:30.981 --> 12:33.070
Do you have this
in any other colours?

12:33.135 --> 12:34.468
Certainly, maaam.

12:37.504 --> 12:40.096
These frocks are all unique,

12:40.161 --> 12:43.362
and are all
only by the best designers.

12:43.497 --> 12:46.206
This, for example,
is Hardy Amies.

12:46.309 --> 12:49.517
A customer wearing
one of these creations

12:49.582 --> 12:52.517
knows that she will not meet
another wearing the same,

12:52.582 --> 12:55.580
which is so terrible a thing
to happen to a woman.

12:55.645 --> 12:59.642
You might find the same
frock at georges in Melbourne,

12:59.707 --> 13:02.362
but, who goes to Melbourne?

13:03.038 --> 13:06.472
And we do not keep different sizes
of the same model because?

13:07.184 --> 13:09.138
Then the frock
wouldn't be unique?

13:09.210 --> 13:10.290
Quite so.

13:10.454 --> 13:14.597
This is perfect for one of
our younger society matrons,

13:14.871 --> 13:18.862
perhaps, to attend
a Ball at the Trocadero.

13:18.989 --> 13:24.089
It is by Elizabeth Arden.
The Americans are so modern.

13:24.961 --> 13:31.236
This... I would like for myself,
it is so very well cut.

13:31.301 --> 13:32.557
See the detail.

13:32.622 --> 13:35.119
But I am not at my best
in the English style.

13:35.184 --> 13:36.447
I cannot understand it,

13:36.512 --> 13:39.213
but all English women are
made in shape of a pear.

13:39.278 --> 13:44.322
Now the French... Jacques Fath,
uh, Chanel, the great dior,

13:44.387 --> 13:47.301
cut to fit a woman
with bosoms and hips,

13:47.366 --> 13:51.464
but they make her look slim
nevertheless, that is artistry.

13:51.739 --> 13:54.539
I suppose
these are very expensive.

13:55.512 --> 13:56.817
Expensive!

13:57.034 --> 13:59.590
They are
fantastically expensive.

13:59.926 --> 14:04.399
And such cost,
as you may one day appreciate,

14:05.279 --> 14:07.269
is part of their charm.

14:11.098 --> 14:13.198
Model gowns?

14:13.434 --> 14:16.790
Well... I thought they were
all model gowns at Goode's.

14:16.877 --> 14:19.547
Oh, no, most of them
are un-model gowns.

14:19.612 --> 14:21.993
They come in all sizes
and anyone can buy them.

14:22.479 --> 14:24.929
Anyway, no-one has
the same clothes you do

14:24.994 --> 14:26.220
because I make them.

14:26.330 --> 14:28.634
So theyre unique too,
aren't they?

14:30.112 --> 14:32.390
I mean, just think of that
lovely pink frock I made you.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.812
The one with the trills.

14:33.877 --> 14:35.290
That's right, mum.

14:36.182 --> 14:37.800
___

14:37.878 --> 14:39.250
On, I... do, mum.

14:39.315 --> 14:40.726
I was just thinking that

14:40.791 --> 14:44.368
most of the model gowns
are... Evening frocks.

14:44.737 --> 14:48.821
Ah... oh, well...
That's another story.

14:50.838 --> 14:52.867
Well, I suppose I could
try my hand at that

14:52.932 --> 14:54.642
if you wanted to go to a Ball.

14:54.747 --> 14:58.814
Hm? Oh, you'd look just lovely.
You would.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.954
Oh, thanks, mum.

- Steak.

- Yeah, it's all you Ever want.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.507

15:53.710 --> 15:55.889

15:59.832 --> 16:03.025

Been on a roof all day.

16:03.649 --> 16:06.210

We got some beer?

16:07.594 --> 16:09.614
Yup. In the fridge.

- Yeah?

16:50.578 --> 16:52.570
Dad, I need you
to sign this form.

16:52.635 --> 16:54.474
It's for a
commonwealth scholarship.

16:54.539 --> 16:55.850
It I get it,
it means the government

16:55.915 --> 16:57.921
will pay my fees
to Sydney University.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.888
It's, it's just, just there.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.943
Look! I've told you before.
No daughter of mine...

17:02.008 --> 17:03.294
- Is going to university.
- That's right.

17:03.359 --> 17:03.998
I know, dad, but...

17:04.063 --> 17:05.818
Ea, she mightn't even
get the scholarship.

17:05.883 --> 17:07.403
Just sign it for her school.

17:07.468 --> 17:09.657
Just for their records,
that's all.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.710

17:11.920 --> 17:13.367
Please, dad.

17:14.977 --> 17:16.009
Please, dad.

17:16.074 --> 17:17.511

17:17.576 --> 17:19.926
Just for their

Lisa.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.908
You've fallen in love.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.460
C'est magnifique.

21:11.643 --> 21:13.875
It's it's different.

21:14.262 --> 21:16.651
Younger designer
but it's also too...

21:16.824 --> 21:19.604
too small for these
big Australian girls.

21:19.793 --> 21:21.126
How much is it?

21:21.519 --> 21:23.652
One hundred and fifty guineas.

21:24.072 --> 21:25.236
C'est bien,

21:25.301 --> 21:27.025
if we do not sell it
before Christmas,

21:27.090 --> 21:30.057
it will go on sale
at 75 guineas.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.081
Seventy-five guineas!

21:33.874 --> 21:36.225
Hm! 'est la vie.

21:36.391 --> 21:38.412
There will be more dresses

21:48.230 --> 21:50.259
Well, I don't see
any problem, Mrs Williams.

21:50.324 --> 21:52.082
You seem completely healthy.

21:52.726 --> 21:55.543
- Perhaps it's your husband.
- My husband?

21:55.730 --> 21:57.276
Get him to come in
for an examination

21:57.341 --> 22:00.057
- maybe it's him who's...
- No. He wouldn't like that.

22:00.302 --> 22:01.551
No.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.754
Well,

22:05.572 --> 22:09.229
tell me... now often
do you have... relations?

22:09.576 --> 22:11.927
- Relations!?
- Uh-huh.

22:13.887 --> 22:18.151
Not that often.
He's tired sometimes.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.906
Perhaps that's the problem.

22:22.502 --> 22:28.323
With... without... proximity...
there's no chance of...

22:45.362 --> 22:47.424

are just, just behind you.

22:56.187 --> 22:58.788
Oh, bloody hell.
What a day!

23:00.963 --> 23:04.030
You did all right, Kia.
Didn't she?

23:04.932 --> 23:08.241
Yes. She did all right, all right.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.157
You're not buying something
from Goode's, are you?

23:12.244 --> 23:13.575
It's too expensive.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.786
- Staff discount.
- “What is it?

23:15.851 --> 23:18.702
On, just a little thing.
Thought it might suit me.

23:21.081 --> 23:22.601
Well, I never.

23:57.178 --> 23:59.950
Frank!
I didn't hear you come in.

24:00.032 --> 24:01.286
You're early.

24:01.419 --> 24:04.395
Boss said to knock off early
to do some Christmas shopping.

24:04.584 --> 24:08.210
Why are you dressed for bed?
It's only six o'clock.

24:08.498 --> 24:11.012
It's new... the night-dress.

24:11.124 --> 24:12.894
I'm just trying it on.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.801
It didn't cost much,
not with the staff discount.

24:16.662 --> 24:18.137
I take it off now.

24:18.537 --> 24:24.151
I'll help ya...
take it off.

24:50.160 --> 24:55.496

24:55.778 --> 25:00.437

could frame thy fearful symmetry?

25:01.206 --> 25:05.855
Inn what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?

25:06.630 --> 25:09.237
On what wings dare he aspire?

25:09.923 --> 25:12.945
What the hand,
dare seize the fire?"

25:21.810 --> 25:23.080
Crikey, where have you been'

25:23.145 --> 25:25.379
we're busier than
a one-armed bricklayer.

25:25.614 --> 25:28.377
Mrs Williams, Christmas is not
the best time for lateness.

25:28.442 --> 25:30.418
Sorry, Miss Cartwright,
the alarm didn't go off.

25:30.497 --> 25:33.191
It's the first time I've been late
since mum's hysterectomy.

25:37.384 --> 25:39.200
Everything okay?

25:39.677 --> 25:42.713
You look like the cat that
ate the cream, I must say.

25:42.778 --> 25:45.464
Everything's fine.
I just overslept.

25:46.209 --> 25:48.105
- Thank you.
- Mm-hhm.

25:48.582 --> 25:50.185
You're with us today, remember?

25:50.309 --> 25:52.780
No sneaking back
to Dracula's hideout.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.636
I just thought he might
have got a bit of overtime.

26:24.785 --> 26:26.395
He's not usually late.

26:26.516 --> 26:28.024
He called up this afternoon.

26:28.186 --> 26:30.134
Said he didn't feel too good.

26:31.013 --> 26:33.713
- Oh... well...
- Look, don't worry, love.

26:33.778 --> 26:35.191
I here'll be some explanation.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.867
He's probably down
at the pub with a few mates.

26:51.764 --> 26:55.167
Excuse me. Thank you.

27:06.743 --> 27:08.208
Lisa.

27:09.016 --> 27:11.714
Is the beast from the Balkans
trying to steal you again?

27:11.872 --> 27:13.800
No, she's invited me
to lunch on Saturday.

27:13.870 --> 27:15.410
With her and her husband

27:16.244 --> 27:19.061
- she's got a husbana?
- Well, evidently!

27:19.177 --> 27:21.932
Well, I hope you like
frog's legs and fish eyes

27:21.997 --> 27:24.065
and sheep's testicles,
because those reffos

27:24.130 --> 27:25.748
eat all kinds
of horrible things.

27:26.223 --> 27:28.988
Oh! Find me a right foot,
will you? Thank you.

28:07.559 --> 28:10.911
- Isn't it glorious?
- Mm-hmm.

28:11.591 --> 28:14.738
- It's just lovely.
- Mm.

28:16.218 --> 28:17.943
I am happy.

28:18.473 --> 28:20.841
Be happy... always.

28:21.309 --> 28:23.870
It's a good choice!

28:32.082 --> 28:37.607
Lisa, may I present my husband,
Stefan Szombathelyi.

28:37.672 --> 28:41.695
He's a Hungarian but not,
alas, a count.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.894
But you can't have Everything.

28:44.194 --> 28:45.642
Stefan, this is Lisa Miles.

28:45.707 --> 28:51.376
My most capable junior
temporary sales assistant.

28:51.701 --> 28:53.543
I am enchanted to meet you.

28:53.715 --> 28:56.180
- Oh!
- Oh, Lisa.

28:56.322 --> 29:00.116
I suppose you haven't heard
we Europeans are always kissing.

29:02.840 --> 29:03.999
Some wine?

29:04.095 --> 29:06.997
We have been amazing to discover
very fine Australian wine.

29:07.062 --> 29:09.628
- Um..
- Oh, perhaps some lemonade.

29:09.705 --> 29:12.516
- Oh, lemonade, yes.
- Thank you.

29:13.458 --> 29:17.230
So, Lisa, tell me,
do you like to read novels?

29:17.295 --> 29:20.640
Oh, yes, I do. I just
finished Anna Karenina

29:20.705 --> 29:21.929
I haven't decided
what to read next.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.597
There are so many
to choose from.

29:23.662 --> 29:26.671
Oh, how true. And the number
always grows, I assure you.

29:26.736 --> 29:30.088
Perhaps your next choice should
be something quite different.

29:30.409 --> 29:33.017
Um... Emma.
Have you read that yet?

29:33.103 --> 29:34.273
No, I haven't!

29:34.338 --> 29:35.651
Oh, well, that is settled, then.

29:35.716 --> 29:40.280
Jane Austen, I assure you,
is as great a genius as Tolstoy,

29:40.345 --> 29:41.758
whatever they say.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.034
You will let me have your
opinion in due course, yes?

29:44.099 --> 29:45.300
Yes, I will.

29:45.911 --> 29:46.971
Oh!

29:47.056 --> 29:50.845
That will be Rudi.
Such a sense of timing. Like no-one.

29:51.893 --> 29:53.192
Yes.

29:53.315 --> 29:55.561
Lisa, put more.

29:55.725 --> 29:57.120
- More?
- Yes.

30:01.464 --> 30:05.487
Ah... lunch time...
I have such a sense of timing.

30:05.719 --> 30:08.704
Like no-one.
But... I have brought a cake.

30:11.299 --> 30:14.868
So, tell us, Rudi, we've
been discussing Jane Austen.

30:14.985 --> 30:16.608
- Ah...
- What do you think of her?

30:16.673 --> 30:19.789
Well, my opinion
has yet to be formed,

30:19.854 --> 30:23.297
- as I have not read one word.
- Ah, a philistine!

30:23.445 --> 30:28.093
No, the truth is I am rather
infatuated with Charles Dickens

30:28.158 --> 30:30.617
you see, he is much better in English
than he is in Hungarian.

30:30.682 --> 30:34.604
So, I am reading again
what I read so long ago.

30:35.385 --> 30:39.884
Dickens in serpo-croat
I never read and I don't care.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.351
His books are stupendously long.
What was he thinking?

30:43.416 --> 30:45.251
I don't have time!

30:45.928 --> 30:50.746
- Magda prefers vogue.
- Vogue and Agatha Christie too.

30:51.033 --> 30:53.398
That's true.
Tell me, what do you think?

30:53.467 --> 30:54.868
- Hm?
- Of the cake.

30:54.986 --> 30:56.423
Oh, it's wondertul.

30:56.549 --> 30:59.067
I must say that in Melbourne,
where I have been living,

30:59.132 --> 31:01.485
there are many better
cake shops than Sydney.

31:01.596 --> 31:03.804
In Melbourne,
they have more need of cake,

31:03.869 --> 31:05.759
having more or less
nothing else.

31:18.124 --> 31:19.204
Mum?

31:19.307 --> 31:22.075
- So what's going on?
- Out with it!

31:22.735 --> 31:24.335
Frank's disappeared.

31:24.706 --> 31:28.258
I knew something was up.
Since when?

31:29.025 --> 31:32.574
He din't come home on Thursday.
He wasn't at work on Friday.

31:32.639 --> 31:34.399
They don't know
where he is, either.

31:35.170 --> 31:37.287
I called the police,
and they said not to worry.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.036
They said
people do it all the time.

31:39.101 --> 31:41.654
That I should call it
he's not back in a week.

31:41.843 --> 31:44.040
- You two have a fight?
- No!

31:44.836 --> 31:49.920
Well, I dunno... he was always
a bit on the peculiar side.

31:50.655 --> 31:56.498
I know. You and Dawn and Joy
you didn't... you don't like him!

31:56.632 --> 32:01.342
I've never said that.
But you wouldn't call him a livewire.

32:02.539 --> 32:04.561
He's just shy. Thats all.

32:05.213 --> 32:07.764
Growing up on the farm.
He didn't have anyone to talk to.

32:07.874 --> 32:10.552
He's always been very...
Inhibited.

32:10.617 --> 32:13.577
Listen, Patty...
I'll tell you this.

32:14.304 --> 32:16.497
No-one understands men.

32:16.929 --> 32:20.084
We don't understand them and
they don't understand themselves.

32:20.895 --> 32:23.561
They do these stupid things.

32:24.182 --> 32:27.534
But they always come back,
in the end.

32:28.726 --> 32:32.134
They can't really manage
by themselves, men can't.

32:33.725 --> 32:39.349
He'll be back...
Or he'll have me to answer to.

32:43.459 --> 32:46.317
S0, may I”? I was just...

32:46.429 --> 32:48.583
I was just wondering
how it would look

32:48.648 --> 32:50.795
if we tried this.

32:59.070 --> 33:01.955
They love to talk in
their barbaric Hungarian.

33:02.020 --> 33:03.775
I thought you were Hungarian.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.936
Me? No.
I am Slovenian.

33:07.304 --> 33:09.833
I suppose you do not know
what it is, Slovenian?

33:09.898 --> 33:10.970
Can you take it oft?

33:11.035 --> 33:15.122
Yes, I do! Ah,
Slovenia is part of Yugoslavia.

33:15.187 --> 33:17.983
The capital city is Jubliana.

33:19.578 --> 33:22.285
You are a genius. No!

33:22.406 --> 33:27.497
I never met before an Australian
who had even heard of this place!

33:27.562 --> 33:33.795
Stefan and I, we met not
in Europe, but in Australia.

33:34.851 --> 33:37.108
In one of your migrant camps.

33:38.664 --> 33:39.978
Not such a lovely place,

33:40.043 --> 33:44.139
but... it was paradise after
what we had been through.

33:44.810 --> 33:45.914
I see.

33:46.147 --> 33:50.569
Hm. Stefan and I, we met
learning English together.

33:52.108 --> 33:56.834
We can speak German, but...
it's not our favourite language.

33:58.422 --> 34:00.186
There it's much better.

34:00.570 --> 34:04.309
Lisa...
can you see without your glasses?

34:04.687 --> 34:07.383
Oh, yes, I only really
need them for reading.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.678
So, why do you wear them always?

34:10.004 --> 34:12.803
I suppose because
I am always reading.

34:13.481 --> 34:15.377
Can we take them off?

34:16.170 --> 34:17.304
Yes.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.127
You have beautiful eyes.

34:29.831 --> 34:34.275
So, one last thing...
Lipstick, I think...

34:35.071 --> 34:39.639
It's a nice pink...
And you can keep it.

34:39.848 --> 34:43.471
It's suitable for a jeune fille.

34:44.414 --> 34:48.268
You have so slim a figure.
Hold on.

34:50.402 --> 34:54.221
I envy you this much.
You should make the most of it.

34:54.378 --> 34:56.406
There, turn around.

34:57.676 --> 35:00.157
You look charming.

35:00.857 --> 35:06.932
And with a bit more experience,
Lisa, you could be enchanting.

35:08.010 --> 35:09.780
How do you feel?”

35:11.232 --> 35:12.879
Different.

35:32.993 --> 35:34.934
Hello, mum! Look!

35:36.957 --> 35:40.324
Lesley, I thought you told us
you'd be home by four o'clock.

35:40.393 --> 35:43.283
Oh, Magda gave me this
and this belt, do you like it?

35:43.863 --> 35:46.236
- Well... um, goodness...
- I'm sorry I'm late,

35:46.301 --> 35:49.775
but we went for a walk and Magda
told me about Slovenia before the war.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.158
Oh! And we talked about books

35:51.223 --> 35:53.080
and Stefan made us
a lovely lunch.

35:53.145 --> 35:54.252
Who's Stefan?

35:54.317 --> 35:55.712
He's Magda's husband.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.378
On, right... he made the lunch?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.801
European men like to cook.

36:00.907 --> 36:03.925
Oh! uh,
I didn't know that.

36:04.301 --> 36:06.729
I like to drink.
I'm off to the pub.

36:06.972 --> 36:08.620
See you in a couple of hours.

36:11.223 --> 36:15.119
Uh, Lesley, I had a telephone
call from that Magda.

36:15.184 --> 36:18.565
That Mrs Zombie
something or other...

36:18.699 --> 36:21.759
to say you were on your way
which was very nice of her

36:21.824 --> 36:26.539
but, um, she tried to tell me
that your name was Lisa.

36:26.789 --> 36:28.559
She didn't seem
to know your name.

36:29.484 --> 36:32.385
Uh... well, that's what
they call me at Goode's.

36:33.523 --> 36:36.499
What do you mean?
Your name is Lesley.

36:37.746 --> 36:39.548
But I don't like Lesley.

36:39.894 --> 36:42.558
But that's your name. Lesley!

36:43.199 --> 36:46.755
But I want to be Lisa.
And I will be and I am!

36:46.820 --> 36:48.124
Lisa?

36:49.551 --> 36:51.806
How do you think it feels
to have your own child

36:51.871 --> 36:54.081
telling you that she wants
a different name?

36:54.426 --> 36:58.018
What's wrong with “Lesley?”
Lesley's a lovely name.

36:58.129 --> 37:01.994
Oh, mum... I just... I just
wanted a real girl's name.

37:02.059 --> 37:03.488
‘Lesley' is a boy's name.

37:03.553 --> 37:06.479
No, Lesley's a girl's name too,
it's spelt differently.

37:06.551 --> 37:09.807
But it sounds the same,
and that's what counts.

37:10.713 --> 37:13.689
I just wanted a proper girl's name
for when I grow up.

37:13.896 --> 37:16.197
I've been a child
for so long now.

37:16.262 --> 37:17.948
I just want to be grown up.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.571
Oh, Lesley...

37:23.863 --> 37:27.323
If you only knew what
being grown up can be like...

37:28.369 --> 37:32.971
You wouldn't... wish it to
be any faster than it is.

37:33.207 --> 37:37.776
Oh, mum.
Please don't cry, mum.

37:38.087 --> 37:42.031
Yeah... I suppose I always
knew that I'd lose you some day.

37:42.145 --> 37:44.323
Oh, no, you'll never lose me.

37:44.426 --> 37:46.698
I'll stay with you always.

37:47.513 --> 37:49.703
But you can't say that,
sweetheart

37:49.941 --> 37:52.409
because you'll marry,
you'll go abroad.

37:52.598 --> 37:54.952
You can't stay with me always...

37:55.404 --> 37:57.550
I'm just being selfish,
I suppose.

37:57.630 --> 37:59.129
No, you're not.

37:59.434 --> 38:03.036
Even if I do marry or go away,
I'll still come and see you.

38:03.237 --> 38:05.563
- Often.
- Well, I hope so.

38:05.628 --> 38:07.269
Of course I will

38:08.501 --> 38:10.968
and you can keep on
calling me Lesley, if you like.

38:11.076 --> 38:12.172
I'll see

38:12.304 --> 38:16.140
I might manage to call you Lisa
sometimes, but that depends.

38:16.751 --> 38:21.150
Right, but now something more
important, your dad's dinner.

38:26.032 --> 38:28.944
You know, that belt
does look very nice on you.

38:29.157 --> 38:31.522
I hope you thanked
Magda properly for that.

38:31.662 --> 38:33.280
Of course I did.

38:40.868 --> 38:44.288
Your little Australian
schoolgirl is most charming.

38:44.460 --> 38:48.420
I can see you are going to turn
a sow's ear into a silk purse.

38:48.485 --> 38:49.525
Hm?

38:49.657 --> 38:54.429
If I do a good deed for once in
my life I cannot see the humour.

38:55.007 --> 38:57.813
Perhaps she reminds
me the little of..

38:57.960 --> 39:02.379
- Of?
- Myself... before the war.

39:02.719 --> 39:06.804
Really”?
I find that hard to believe.

39:07.164 --> 39:12.898
- She's so...
- Innocent... and naive, I know.

39:14.235 --> 39:17.835
Do you think I was always
tres sophistiquée?

39:18.903 --> 39:21.010
Well... yes.

39:22.016 --> 39:24.226
I can assure you
that's not the case.

39:24.535 --> 39:26.418
- Stefan.
- Mm-hm?

39:26.649 --> 39:29.312
This is most odd.

39:29.641 --> 39:34.489
When I called Lisa's mother,
she didn't seem to know

39:34.609 --> 39:36.394
the name of her own child.

39:37.368 --> 39:40.249
‘Lesley' she pronounces it.

39:41.332 --> 39:44.341
T'his Australian speech
is very bizarre.

39:44.490 --> 39:46.192
What can be expected?

39:46.257 --> 39:48.099
They're the
descendants of convicts,

39:48.168 --> 39:51.273
their accent comes from
the lower classes of England.

39:52.388 --> 39:57.913
‘Lesley... Lesley... ‘lesley?

39:58.644 --> 40:01.086
‘Lesley', "Lesley".

40:01.433 --> 40:02.828
‘Lesley.'

40:23.267 --> 40:24.928
Espresso.

40:27.017 --> 40:28.165
Ah.

40:33.442 --> 40:36.618
On! It's only place in town
with decent coffee

40:36.760 --> 40:39.540
owned by?
"Russian reffos.

40:39.767 --> 40:41.831
A relative of the Tsar, they say.

40:41.896 --> 40:44.110
- Am?
- From the court of st Petersburg

40:44.175 --> 40:48.297
to pitt street in Sydney. Now,
I only have 20 minutes. What?

40:49.570 --> 40:53.172
- Rudi needs assistance.
- Oh!

40:53.408 --> 40:56.094
I wish to find a girlfriend.

40:56.197 --> 40:57.609
I know very few people
here in Sydney.

40:57.674 --> 40:59.499
I look to you
and Stefan for help.

40:59.564 --> 41:00.571
Uh, hmm.

41:00.649 --> 41:02.843
Well, I can think of
no-one at the moment.

41:02.908 --> 41:04.881
I think you have to
arrange this for yourself.

41:04.946 --> 41:06.049
I am not fussy.

41:06.114 --> 41:10.210
No, you want only a beauty,
less than thirty years old,

41:10.275 --> 41:13.352
cultivated, if not also rich.

41:13.533 --> 41:15.933
Certainly I will want a beauty.
Cultivated, well,

41:15.998 --> 41:18.743
I have... heard there is
such a thing, but...

41:18.808 --> 41:21.851
What do you mean?
Naturally, we are cultivated,

41:21.916 --> 41:24.726
we reffos, we "new Australians.
We are famous for it!

41:24.791 --> 41:26.736
It's our most despicable quality.

41:26.801 --> 41:28.624
Oh, no, you misunderstand me.

41:28.689 --> 41:31.040
This time I am not
looking for a reffo.

41:31.133 --> 41:33.252
I want an Australian girl.

41:33.689 --> 41:35.051
An Australian!

41:36.189 --> 41:38.842
Some of them are very beautiful.
Have you not noticed?

41:39.049 --> 41:40.072
Yes.

41:40.166 --> 41:42.395
The cultivated ones
have gone away.

41:42.540 --> 41:44.680
- They've gone away.
- Uh-huh.

41:45.447 --> 41:46.524
Where have they gone”?

41:47.089 --> 41:52.852
They have-They 've gone away to London,
sometimes they go to Paris...

41:52.917 --> 41:54.066
Spasiba.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.650
To Paris or New York, Rome.

41:56.823 --> 41:58.947
- Hm.
- And if you find one here...

41:59.035 --> 42:01.351
She is saving her fare,
I guarantee it.

42:02.370 --> 42:04.690
Well, then

42:04.909 --> 42:08.251
I shall take an uncultivated
one and cultivate her myself.

42:08.316 --> 42:13.213
But a nice, strong, healthy,
available Australian girl.

42:14.768 --> 42:18.486
Well, I can think of no-one
with all of these qualifications.

42:20.438 --> 42:24.508
Maybe you should give
yourself a thought, hm?

42:27.268 --> 42:28.376
Yes?

42:34.628 --> 42:36.136
What are you doing
for Christmas?

42:36.329 --> 42:37.491
Oh, I don't know.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.719
I might go to Melbourne,
to my brother's.

42:39.798 --> 42:42.578
Melbourne? I thought
you said his wife was a cow.

42:42.650 --> 42:44.805
Yeah, she is.
She doesn't do a thing!

42:44.962 --> 42:46.983
She's got legs
like tree trunks too.

42:48.298 --> 42:49.873
Why don't you come
to the Blue Mountains?

42:49.938 --> 42:51.590
Mum and dad
have retired up there.

42:51.901 --> 42:54.046
- Yeah, that might be nice...
- Thanks.

42:54.111 --> 42:57.641
Then there's always a good new
year Eve's party at the Hydro.

42:58.365 --> 43:03.186
- Oh, I forgot, you're oft blokes.
- No, I'm not, just... some blokes.

43:03.251 --> 43:04.734
Look, what are
we going to go to?

43:04.937 --> 43:05.990
Um.

43:07.230 --> 43:11.280
I reckon the Nun's story.
Audrey Hepburn, she's gorgeous.

43:11.345 --> 43:14.030
God, it look serious.
Can't we see something funny?

43:14.095 --> 43:16.608
Oh! I'm all right Jack.
What about that?

43:16.673 --> 43:18.797
Ugh, I don't know.

43:20.353 --> 43:23.436
On ine beach, Gregory peck!
Oh, he's divine!

43:23.501 --> 43:25.844
Oh... he really is.

44:08.582 --> 44:12.538
And I told her that you probably
wouldn't like them but, um...

44:12.879 --> 44:14.627
I love scones.

44:15.215 --> 44:16.455
Oh!

44:16.910 --> 44:21.940
That is... really, really kind.
Please thank your mother.

44:22.832 --> 44:28.268
Very kindly. May I wish you and
your family happy Christmas.

44:28.348 --> 44:32.190
Now, Lisa, perhaps you can
help me with a small problem.

44:32.334 --> 44:37.463
Rudi has decided that he wants
an Australian girlfriend.

44:40.801 --> 44:45.449
No! No, don't worry, not you.
Oh, no, no...

44:45.514 --> 44:49.440
Um... you are much too
young and too clever for him.

44:49.524 --> 44:54.581
No, someone older and
perhaps not too particular.

45:01.355 --> 45:03.546
Magda... there is someone.

45:08.754 --> 45:12.226
Oh, no, not Miss cartwrignt!

45:12.291 --> 45:15.899

what he has in mind.

Yeah.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.569
She is about thirty or less,
but not bad.

45:35.164 --> 45:38.966
She's rough. She has no style.

45:41.067 --> 45:42.147
Perfect!

45:54.667 --> 45:57.605
It's been
a wonderful effort once again.

with your family?

46:23.472 --> 46:24.531
Oh, yes.

46:24.796 --> 46:27.522
My dear mother passed away
this year, as you know.

46:27.648 --> 46:29.685
But I have some
delightful nephews

46:48.470 --> 46:49.976

There will be many people,
and Lisa will be there.

48:57.804 --> 49:00.076
I was just wondering
about the colour.

49:00.310 --> 49:03.911

- Oh, of course not.

51:49.003 --> 51:51.010
What a very vulgar suggestion.

- Are you?
- Oh, dear, I hope not.

52:10.378 --> 52:14.603
I'm not saying that I'm going.
I'm just thinking about it.

52:15.042 --> 52:16.533
It's a bloody mad laea.

What's that, dear?

Who's going to be at Magda's party”?
Are you meeting someone?

52:29.980 --> 52:33.376
No! I don't know anyone.
I think they'll all be continentals.

52:33.855 --> 52:36.881
Continentals!
Gosh, it's getting worse!

52:37.003 --> 52:39.863
They'll all be jjabbering on,
you won't know what they're saying.

52:41.924 --> 52:45.416
One of them might be a count,
you never know.

52:45.549 --> 52:46.972
- A count?!
- Yeah, like...

52:47.037 --> 52:48.469
I wouldn't count on that.

52:48.534 --> 52:51.877
- I mean like count Ronsky.
- What's wrong with Australians?

52:57.464 --> 53:00.346
So, Lisa, please pay attention.

53:00.411 --> 53:03.049
Because of the new year parties,

53:03.136 --> 53:07.283
a lot of ladies will be
coming in asking for dresses

53:07.370 --> 53:11.089
at the sales prices...
before the sales

53:11.158 --> 53:12.454
and you'll let them have them?

53:12.519 --> 53:13.862
Not on your life.

53:13.972 --> 53:18.548
But in model gowns...
Always polite.

53:18.675 --> 53:20.064
You can say...

53:20.175 --> 53:24.054
"No, madame,
I regret it is not possible.”

53:24.167 --> 53:25.963
and, "I am so sorry."

53:26.042 --> 53:27.814
Then they buy it,
not to look cheap.

53:29.097 --> 53:32.790
- Every time.
- Is that still here?

53:34.730 --> 53:40.393
Yeah, so... maybe it will
be in the sale. Half price.

53:41.383 --> 53:45.452
- Seventy five guineas.
- Perhaps you have a rich uncle?

53:45.929 --> 53:47.745
I'm afraid not.

53:50.941 --> 53:54.924
So, mum, what about the collar?
Can we take that out too?

53:55.080 --> 53:57.455
- Well... yes.
- Yes?

53:57.527 --> 54:00.064
And don't you think
a belt would be nice?

54:00.620 --> 54:02.993
Oh, yes, a belt might be nice.
Yeah!

54:03.058 --> 54:05.049
Just here. Um

54:05.183 --> 54:08.178
but... what about the frills?
I'm not too sure about...

54:08.243 --> 54:10.094
No, but you've
always loved the frills.

54:10.159 --> 54:13.024
Of course! Of course I like them,
I was just...

54:13.089 --> 54:14.795
There's a lot of detail
in those frills

54:14.860 --> 54:18.627
yes, but they do make the dress
a bit long, don't you think?

54:20.885 --> 54:24.978
It's just, it might be
a bit too long for me, yeah?

54:25.167 --> 54:27.328
We could maybe take it up a bit?

54:27.393 --> 54:29.124
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

59:20.472 --> 59:22.939
No, mum, his wife and son
were there too.

59:23.063 --> 59:25.365
Foldes!
What kind of name is that?

59:25.430 --> 59:27.247
Theyre Hungarians, dad.

59:27.312 --> 59:31.538
Hungarian'? God, country's
full of bloody foreigners!

59:31.711 --> 59:34.366
But, dad, we all came here
from Europe sometime.

59:34.438 --> 59:37.076
Crikey! Here we go.
Now I'm getting a history lesson, am I?

59:37.141 --> 59:39.310
Now, you better get to bed, Lisa.

59:39.375 --> 59:41.038
- Get some sleep.
- Yes, all right, mum.

59:56.483 --> 59:58.818
I should have gone
to mass this morning.

59:58.959 --> 01:00:00.257
Oh!

01:00:02.335 --> 01:00:04.115
Too late now.

01:00:05.004 --> 01:00:07.355
Well, there is a midday mass.

01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:11.337
Aah!
I need some rest.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.085
I'm sure God will understand.

01:00:15.318 --> 01:00:17.467
- Stefan.
- Hm?

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:21.575
I think perhaps in one year,
maybe one year and a half,

01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:24.638
we must look for premises
in woollahra.

01:00:24.959 --> 01:00:27.102
Even better - double bay.

01:00:28.373 --> 01:00:30.238
European fashions, huh?

01:00:30.303 --> 01:00:34.075
Exclusive fashions, expensive.

01:00:34.514 --> 01:00:37.309
Goode''s doesn't know
the meaning of the word.

01:01:00.144 --> 01:01:02.439
- Sorry!
- That's quite all right.

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.308
- 1 thank you.
- Thank you.

01:01:15.481 --> 01:01:16.674
- Rudi?!
- Huh?

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:19.362
- Are you looking for a frock?
- Of course!

01:01:19.567 --> 01:01:21.528
What do you think,
this one suits me?

01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:23.446
Yeah!
Rudi, you can't stay here.

01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:25.100
Miss Cartwright will have a fit

01:01:25.165 --> 01:01:29.832
in fact, my dear Lisa, I wish
to speak a few words to Fay.

01:01:30.445 --> 01:01:34.186
Oh, she's gone to morning tea.
Oh, wait, there she is.

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:44.084
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:50.976
Fay, I've came to ask if you will
risk an outing with a “reffo”.

01:01:51.055 --> 01:01:53.101
On Friday night.

01:01:53.736 --> 01:01:55.256
Please think about it.

01:01:55.797 --> 01:01:58.828
On, I... don't need
to think about it.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.432
Then I will call you
on Thursday night.

01:02:02.508 --> 01:02:06.068
On, no, no phone calls. My landlady,
she's a real old battleaxe.

01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:08.709
Don't worry, I will smother her
in middle European charm.

01:02:08.774 --> 01:02:11.147
Soon she will be looking
forward to my calls.

01:02:12.914 --> 01:02:13.994
Oh well.

01:02:15.146 --> 01:02:19.647
I should, um.... oh, sorry.

01:02:45.134 --> 01:02:49.280
Oh!
It has been a madhouse here.

01:02:50.102 --> 01:02:53.975
Did I see that Hungarian wolf
prowling around?

01:02:54.132 --> 01:02:55.913
I think he's asked Fay out.

01:02:58.985 --> 01:03:02.936
Well, I have something to say
but I don't want to translate it.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.666
It's still there.

01:03:07.336 --> 01:03:11.561
But I won't be responsible
if you rob a bank to buy it.

01:03:12.412 --> 01:03:15.210
And it could sell,
very soon, at 50 guineas.

01:03:15.275 --> 01:03:18.713
Oh, please don't say that.
Please don't sell it.

01:03:18.778 --> 01:03:22.399
Lisa, that is a promise
I could never make.

01:03:27.649 --> 01:03:30.560
Fifty pounds for
a dress! I've never spent...

01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:33.677
Guineas. 50 guineas. That's
50 pounds, 50 shillings.

01:03:33.742 --> 01:03:36.546
On, that's even worse.
You could buy ten dresses for that.

01:03:36.656 --> 01:03:39.192
- Not like this one, mum.
- Oh, I don't know, Lesley.

01:03:39.257 --> 01:03:40.772
- Lisa.
- Lisa

01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:43.725
I don't know what's happening
to you. It's that Magda.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.107
Now someone called Michael's
called you up. Now, who's he?

01:03:47.172 --> 01:03:48.858
Get the oven door, will you?

01:03:49.008 --> 01:03:51.505
Ah, he's a boy.
Just done the leaving.

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.249
- His father drove me home on...
- Oh, yes, on new year's Eve.

01:03:54.314 --> 01:03:57.115
But you said he was Hungarian.
He sounded Australian.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.404
Well, he was born here.

01:03:58.469 --> 01:04:01.075
Oh, well, in that case,
I suppose he is Australian.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.512
I suppose so.

01:04:03.805 --> 01:04:06.815
Get me a Sherry,
will you in the cabinet, in there.

01:05:12.336 --> 01:05:15.655
- So, who was that director?
- Réné clément. Really charming.

01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:18.974
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just, it's so sad.

01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:20.779
I've never seen
the French film before.

01:05:20.844 --> 01:05:23.311
Then I have arrived
just in time to rescue you.

01:05:25.253 --> 01:05:28.596
We will see them all,
les enfants du paradis,

01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:32.449
la regle du jeu, pépé le moko.

01:05:33.046 --> 01:05:34.502
Are they all sad?

01:05:34.672 --> 01:05:37.621
No, not at all,
some are most amusing.

01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:39.715
Perhaps this wasn't
a good choice.

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.946
No, no, no, no, it was.
I loved it.

01:05:46.281 --> 01:05:49.811
The Nazis conscripted me
when they occupied Hungary.

01:05:50.764 --> 01:05:53.567
They had me work
the railway lines.

01:05:54.365 --> 01:05:57.700
Not at all... pleasant.

01:05:59.412 --> 01:06:02.066
I escaped to Romania
and hid there

01:06:02.131 --> 01:06:04.972
for the remainder of the war.
How is the goulash?

01:06:05.037 --> 01:06:07.715
- Oh, it's delicious. Go on.
- Uh!

01:06:10.794 --> 01:06:16.114
After the war,
I was a bureaucrat in Budapest.

01:06:16.287 --> 01:06:22.286
Huh! What a line...
I should, I should write a song.

01:06:22.351 --> 01:06:26.829
But... the communists were no
improvement on the Nazis...

01:06:27.435 --> 01:06:35.075
So... I escaped to the
evil capitalist west...

01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:38.891
..during the uprising in 1956.

01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:40.707
On, I've heard of that.

01:06:40.772 --> 01:06:46.020
First Italy, then England
and now Australia.

01:06:47.428 --> 01:06:49.113
This is where I intend
to make money.

01:06:49.178 --> 01:06:53.090
This is...
The country of opportunity.

01:06:54.107 --> 01:06:56.575
Perhaps I am to be...

01:06:56.817 --> 01:06:59.090
Ausralia's first Hungarian

01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:01.581
ex-communist mir...

01:07:08.137 --> 01:07:09.473
List.

01:07:14.543 --> 01:07:19.317
Tell me, do you prefer list to
Mozart or Beethoven to both?

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:25.106
I'm not sure.

01:07:25.665 --> 01:07:30.938
Well, I will take care of that,
if you will permit me.

01:07:31.003 --> 01:07:34.581
You are very musical or you
could not dance so well

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.200
what about books?

01:07:39.278 --> 01:07:42.229
Oh, I've just finished
reading Anna Karenina.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:43.838
Lisa lent it to me.

01:07:44.262 --> 01:07:48.456
Remarkable. I have found
an Australian intellectual

01:07:48.621 --> 01:07:51.354
and Magda told me
they were all in England.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.015
- Thank you.
- Thank you, dear.

01:08:14.463 --> 01:08:17.359
Fay... Fay!

01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:22.657
Ee, look at that.

01:08:22.721 --> 01:08:25.116
Looks like he just wandered
in from the sheep show.

01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:46.773
Oh, Patty!

01:08:46.912 --> 01:08:48.765
On, darling!

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:54.273
No, please, move away,
we must attend to this lady.

01:08:54.571 --> 01:08:55.986
She's my wife!

01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:57.810
Oh. Gracious.

01:08:57.875 --> 01:08:59.975
Well, it's good that you're here.
You can take her home.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.639
Patty, can you hear me??

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:05.265
I have sal volatile.
It never fails.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.249
[Fayl just nice and slow.

01:09:12.102 --> 01:09:13.443
Go to hell!

01:09:13.508 --> 01:09:17.837
Now, now, now, shh.
You've had a shock. Just be quiet.

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:19.189
Tell him to go to hell.

01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:21.041
Yeah, I've been to hell.

01:09:21.143 --> 01:09:23.176
I've just got back, but
I couldn't find my key.

01:09:24.095 --> 01:09:26.194
Gotta get my house keys off va.

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:28.813
- Fainted?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.962
Right in the miadle
of ladies' cocktails.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.977
- Her husband was there, too.
- What was he doing there?

01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:35.281
I don't know.

01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:37.892
Well, that sounds
very odd to me.

01:09:38.448 --> 01:09:40.252
I wonder why she
hasn't had children

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:42.638
- you should see her husband.
- Now, Lesley...

01:09:42.703 --> 01:09:45.408
Lisa...
What do you know about that?

01:09:45.611 --> 01:09:47.617
Well, he's completely gormiess.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:49.508
Yes, well, so are lots of men.

01:09:49.573 --> 01:09:51.871
But it doesn't stop them
from becoming fathers.

01:09:54.847 --> 01:09:57.947
Well, I grew up
in Bendigo, in Victoria.

01:09:58.932 --> 01:10:04.209
But my dad died when I was 11
in the war in new Guinea, so...

01:10:04.472 --> 01:10:06.431
We moved around
a lot after that.

01:10:07.368 --> 01:10:11.095
I had to leave school as soon
as I turned 15 and find a job.

01:10:11.372 --> 01:10:12.372
So.

01:10:15.533 --> 01:10:18.556
You Australians are
a mysterious people.

01:10:19.284 --> 01:10:21.274
No-one would guess
that this is a place

01:10:21.339 --> 01:10:23.357
that people can also suffer.

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:30.486
It is the constant sunshine.
It hides Everything but itself.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:37.297
- Where have you been?
- Wagga.

01:10:37.912 --> 01:10:40.586
Wagga?
Wagga Wagga”.

01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:43.028
Yeah,
Wagga Wagga.

01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:46.756
Phil O'Connell remember him?

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.975
He was always
asking me to go down

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.586
and give him
a hand with the pub.

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:55.344
So I thought...
Over Christmas, New Year's.

01:10:56.618 --> 01:10:58.866
You didn't bother telling me,
of course

01:10:59.267 --> 01:11:02.859
I'm only your wife.
I wouldn't worry, would 1?

01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:06.264
I wouldn't have to go tell
lies for you at Wonda's Tiles,

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:10.246
or turn up at Goode's
feeling sick and terrible!

01:11:10.681 --> 01:11:12.781
And why are you
back now, anyway?

01:11:13.298 --> 01:11:15.579
I suppose you ran out
of clean shirts!

01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:16.945
Well, I tell you what...

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.633
You can clean your own
bloody shirts from now on!

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.431
I'm sorry. I should've thought.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.319
Just had my mind
on other things.

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:45.961
Yeah?!
Like what, for instance?!

01:11:48.369 --> 01:11:53.008
I just felt... after that night,
you know, you...

01:11:53.228 --> 01:11:56.500
I thought you wouldn't want
to see me again, for a while.

01:11:57.264 --> 01:11:58.742
That night”?

01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:05.349
With the night dress?

01:12:06.337 --> 01:12:07.337
Yeah.

01:12:09.981 --> 01:12:11.391
Oh.

01:12:13.712 --> 01:12:16.261
- Frank.
- Yeah!

01:12:18.618 --> 01:12:20.674
That's what's
been bothering you?

01:12:20.876 --> 01:12:22.134
Yeah.

01:12:22.962 --> 01:12:26.352
- That's why you shot through?
- Yep.

01:12:29.321 --> 01:12:31.959
- Frank...
- Yeah?

01:12:34.947 --> 01:12:38.500
That was wonderful...
That night...

01:12:41.868 --> 01:12:45.783
I just thought... you know,
the way I carried on, it was...

01:12:45.907 --> 01:12:48.026
- A bit...
- It was wonderful.

01:13:00.813 --> 01:13:02.812
- You know what”?
- What?

01:13:02.918 --> 01:13:05.519
I am so hungry.

01:13:05.931 --> 01:13:09.026
Vwhy don't you go down the street
and get us some fish and chips?

01:13:09.822 --> 01:13:13.702
I'll call mum when you're out.
And don't be long...

01:13:14.143 --> 01:13:15.503
I'm starving!

01:13:17.908 --> 01:13:21.789
Yeah, well, all right then.

01:13:25.064 --> 01:13:27.416
So that was okay, that night”?

01:13:29.033 --> 01:13:30.641
I'll say it was!

01:13:45.278 --> 01:13:49.275
We have heard nothing from Rudi.
I wonder why.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:52.777
Well... he is obviously
engaged elsewhere.

01:13:53.114 --> 01:13:56.954
Correct. Did you see who
he left the party with?

01:13:57.389 --> 01:14:01.261
- The prettiest girl”?
- The Australian girl. Fay.

01:14:02.566 --> 01:14:05.578
Fay is an adult.
She can look after herself.

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.525
She is a naive Australian girl,

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:12.167
experienced no doubt only
with clumsy Australian men.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.932
And Rudi is a wolf
of a different colour.

01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:16.722
This is melodrama.

01:14:16.864 --> 01:14:19.832
The reality probably is that
both are at a loose end

01:14:19.897 --> 01:14:23.394
it suits them for the time
being to see each other.

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:28.408
For a woman, it is never
only for amusement.

01:14:28.473 --> 01:14:30.377
I'he heart is engaged,
so it may be broken.

01:14:30.442 --> 01:14:32.109
And it will be my fault.

01:14:32.174 --> 01:14:34.525
Nonsense.
You merely introduced them.

01:14:34.684 --> 01:14:36.518
Now the ball is in their court.

01:14:36.653 --> 01:14:41.277
Hm? You are crossing the bridge
before the horse has bolted.

01:15:15.587 --> 01:15:18.486
Magnificent!

01:15:18.923 --> 01:15:22.507
Such a wonderful country...
and so empty!

01:15:24.837 --> 01:15:26.733
We must keep
its existence a secret,

01:15:26.798 --> 01:15:28.194
or all those bloody reffos

01:15:28.259 --> 01:15:30.601
will come racing down
here from Europe.

01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:36.476
Now for one of your...
Famous sandwiches.

01:15:47.775 --> 01:15:49.106
Mm!

01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:51.700
Not bad!

01:15:52.743 --> 01:15:55.723
Are they different from
continental sandwiches?

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:59.578
Yes...
But the principle is the same.

01:16:01.454 --> 01:16:03.202
What are you thinking?

01:16:03.407 --> 01:16:06.335
Oh, nothing... nothing much.

01:16:10.009 --> 01:16:13.381
Well, you remember I was going
to tell you the rest of my story.

01:16:14.493 --> 01:16:18.216
- Your disgraceful past.
- Yes.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:23.812
- Am I going to be shocked?
- I think so.

01:16:24.721 --> 01:16:27.948
Proceed, shock me.

01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:35.848
Well, when I was about 10,
I wanted to be a ballet dancer

01:16:36.524 --> 01:16:39.862
but my mother had no money
for proper lessons, so...

01:16:40.886 --> 01:16:48.138
Um, when I was about 16,
I ended up in this... nightclub.

01:16:49.286 --> 01:16:51.833
- Horrible.
- Yes.

01:16:52.923 --> 01:16:55.504
And after a while I, um...

01:16:56.026 --> 01:17:03.178
I met this man, Mr Marlow...
And, um, he was a businessman.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:09.171
He was older at least 45.

01:17:12.985 --> 01:17:17.312
He rented a flat for me...
in kings cross...

01:17:18.664 --> 01:17:23.789
And, um... and he would visit...
and

01:17:31.976 --> 01:17:34.702
were you in love
with this Mr Marlow?

01:17:35.445 --> 01:17:38.375
Oh, no.

01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:44.850
And does this Mr Marlow
still feature in your life?

01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:55.622
Believe me, Fay...
The pope in Rome

01:17:55.687 --> 01:17:58.889
does not have me high on the list
being considered for sainthood.

01:18:05.596 --> 01:18:07.196
Magnificent!

01:18:11.101 --> 01:18:13.248
Six, seven, eight!

01:18:15.814 --> 01:18:17.013
And out, in, hip!

01:18:17.078 --> 01:18:23.281
Hip! Hip! Step, cross, shoulders,
and around!

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.578
And flick!

01:18:29.484 --> 01:18:31.944
Jump, kick, step, step!

01:18:32.215 --> 01:18:33.500
And one!

01:18:38.877 --> 01:18:42.491
Step, lunge, straight line!

01:18:45.969 --> 01:18:48.949
Diagonal! And around!

01:18:49.014 --> 01:18:50.904
First group!

01:18:50.969 --> 01:18:52.739
Personalities!

01:18:55.046 --> 01:18:59.405
Big finish! And slow!

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:03.380
- Thank you, ladies!
- Okay, girls.

01:19:03.445 --> 01:19:05.741
I suppose it could be worse.
Take a break!

01:19:05.843 --> 01:19:07.262
Another run-through at six.

01:19:07.338 --> 01:19:08.794
So I think it was good
at the top

01:19:08.859 --> 01:19:10.036
- this time. But, um,
- Okay.

01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:11.935
The middle section
needs a little bit of work.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.709
Ah, want the old job back, Fay?

01:19:13.812 --> 01:19:15.350
Not right now, Gerald.

01:19:15.415 --> 01:19:17.857
- That was good, darling.
- Thanks!

01:19:18.398 --> 01:19:20.977
So, how are things
with your continental?

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:23.271
- Good.
- What's his name?

01:19:23.336 --> 01:19:26.810
- Rudi Janosi.
- How do you spell it?

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:31.621
An j-a-n-o-s-i
what?

01:19:32.383 --> 01:19:34.063
Well, he could change it,
you know.

01:19:34.128 --> 01:19:35.609
Quite a few of them do that.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.844
Rud won't.

01:19:36.922 --> 01:19:39.795
Rudi says the best thing to do
if there's anything unusual

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.054
about you is to...
Brazen it out

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:45.694
you want to be careful.

01:19:45.828 --> 01:19:48.554
You haven't known him long.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

01:19:50.344 --> 01:19:53.097
I'd rather be hurt by Rudi
than the types I used to know.

01:19:53.719 --> 01:19:56.559
Well, at least with an Australian
you know where you are.

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:59.390
Well, that's not too hot
if you don't want to be there.

01:19:59.703 --> 01:20:03.652
At least with a continental
you're going somewhere new.

01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:05.689
Yes. And it could be dangerous.

01:20:07.297 --> 01:20:09.272
Life is dangerous.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.366
You should hear
some of Rudi's stories.

01:20:12.594 --> 01:20:15.160
We live in a cocoon here.

01:20:15.388 --> 01:20:17.284
We don't know
how lucky we are.

01:20:17.766 --> 01:20:20.002
I'll bet he knows
how lucky he is.

01:20:20.508 --> 01:20:22.546
He put the hard word on you yet?

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:23.718
No.

01:20:29.355 --> 01:20:35.925
- Do you love him, Fay?
- Yes, I reckon I do.

01:20:38.195 --> 01:20:39.746
Come here.

01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:50.191
I can't eat a thing.

01:21:05.012 --> 01:21:07.042
- Lisa?
- Hm?

01:21:07.325 --> 01:21:09.341
Have you found that
one in madam's size yet?

01:21:09.443 --> 01:21:12.526
Um...
No, we don't seem to have it.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.855
That girl's off with the pixies.

01:21:25.045 --> 01:21:27.944
- Oh, you know why?
- No, why?

01:21:28.035 --> 01:21:30.030
Why, her exam results
come out tomorrow

01:21:30.114 --> 01:21:33.378
well, tonight if she goes down
to the herald building about 11.

01:21:36.496 --> 01:21:38.073
Here you are, madam.

01:22:00.346 --> 01:22:03.394
Hey, ed, haven't you got a girl
that's just done the leaving?

01:22:03.489 --> 01:22:04.504
Yeah.

01:22:04.582 --> 01:22:05.775
Well, they ve finished
setting the results.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.158
Get your tall down there.
Have a look, see how she went.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.556
I'll look after this for a bit.

01:22:09.621 --> 01:22:13.502
- Oh, no need to bother, mate.
- Don't be a spoilsport.

01:22:13.567 --> 01:22:15.752
Look, I'll go and check for you.
It's a big day for her.

01:22:15.817 --> 01:22:19.722
- What school was it?
- She goes to North Sydney Girls.

01:22:19.836 --> 01:22:20.957
Oh.

01:22:29.985 --> 01:22:33.799
Sorry, excuse me.
Sorry, excuse me.

01:22:33.864 --> 01:22:35.589
1 got four A's and a B!

01:22:47.752 --> 01:22:50.474
- Is her name Lesley?
- Yeah!

01:22:50.539 --> 01:22:51.760
Listen to this!

01:22:51.825 --> 01:22:54.949
Five A's and first-class honours
in English and history.

01:22:56.887 --> 01:22:58.567
That sounds all right,
doesn't it?

01:22:59.121 --> 01:23:00.522
Jeez, you re a cool one, ed.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.703
It's bloody great,
that's what it is!

01:23:02.976 --> 01:23:08.550
Yeah! Huh! Well,
I should get back to work.

01:23:14.613 --> 01:23:18.386
I hear your daughter's
distinguished herself famously!

01:23:18.473 --> 01:23:20.420
Congratulations!
Wonderful news!

01:23:20.485 --> 01:23:21.901
Good on you, mate!

01:23:21.989 --> 01:23:24.487
I suppose she'll be
off to Sydney uni?

01:23:25.004 --> 01:23:26.897
You must be very proud, ed.

01:23:27.042 --> 01:23:28.323
- Yeah, well...
- Nice one, ed!

01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:31.556
I'm not sure about that,
I'm not sure about the university.

01:23:31.621 --> 01:23:34.105
Well, surely you wouldn't
waste brains like that

01:23:34.231 --> 01:23:37.244
Ana you tell her to come and
see us if she wants a cadetship.

01:23:37.309 --> 01:23:38.072
Congratulations, mate.

01:23:38.137 --> 01:23:40.737
But first,
university's the thing.

01:23:40.909 --> 01:23:42.283
Both my girls are there.

01:23:42.348 --> 01:23:43.917
Having the time of their life.

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:50.133
What do va reckon, ed?

01:23:50.198 --> 01:23:52.510
Someone in the family's
got some brains, hey?!

01:23:53.453 --> 01:23:54.928
Thanks, mate.

01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:01.720
- Mum!
- I know. Your father telephoned.

01:24:01.826 --> 01:24:04.085
Oh, gosh!
What did he say?

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:05.172
Well, nothing much.

01:24:05.237 --> 01:24:07.563
He was suffering from shock
or he wouldn't have phoned.

01:24:07.698 --> 01:24:11.006
Oh, Lesley... Lisa!
This is the proudest day of my life!

01:24:11.071 --> 01:24:13.031
Mine too. So far.

01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:19.289
♪ Volare, whoa-oh ♪

01:24:21.157 --> 01:24:27.266
♪ Cantare, whoa-oh-oh-ohh... ♪

01:24:42.227 --> 01:24:43.267
Frank.

01:24:44.995 --> 01:24:48.250
Yeah, what?
Would you like some more toast?

01:24:49.688 --> 01:24:53.203
Put the blooady tray
down and come over here

01:25:09.957 --> 01:25:14.242
Lisa!
Whose name is also Lesley!

01:25:14.353 --> 01:25:16.711
Oh, my young friend,
this is a most happy day!

01:25:16.776 --> 01:25:18.069
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh

01:25:18.134 --> 01:25:20.320
what's going on?
Is she, are you engaged?!

01:25:20.392 --> 01:25:23.468
Oh, tush, at her age?
God forbid, no.

01:25:23.533 --> 01:25:26.335
She has obtained
most magnificent

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.014
results in the
Leaving Certificate.

01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:29.293
- Good on you, Lisa!
- Thank you.

01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:31.577
- Congratulations!
- Oh, thank you so much.

01:25:31.642 --> 01:25:34.521
Stefan sends his love,
but we were not surprised.

01:25:34.586 --> 01:25:36.600
I read it in the herald
this morning, it's fabulous!

01:25:36.665 --> 01:25:39.052
- Congratulations, Lisa.
- Oh, thank you so much, Mr Ryder.

01:25:39.117 --> 01:25:40.275
Lisa

01:25:48.892 --> 01:25:51.083
your results were
no surprise to me.

01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:53.944
Thank you.

01:25:54.259 --> 01:25:56.623
Youre a clever girl,
I could see that

01:25:57.603 --> 01:25:59.453
it's a pleasure
to work with you,

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:01.570
and I'll be sorry
when you leave us.

01:26:02.947 --> 01:26:04.438
A clever girl...

01:26:05.823 --> 01:26:09.471
Is the most wondertul thing
in all creation, you know?

01:26:10.806 --> 01:26:12.688
You must never forget that.

01:26:13.291 --> 01:26:15.562
So you go to university...

01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:19.608
and don't pass up
any opportunities.

01:26:20.032 --> 01:26:22.641
You just go away and
be as clever as you can.

01:26:23.454 --> 01:26:25.572
It's the best thing you
could possibly do...

01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:32.218
You and all the clever girls
in this city and the world.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.305
Now, we'd better get on and sell
some cocktail frocks, hadn't we?

01:27:19.736 --> 01:27:22.742
Now, Lesley, I can't see
what you want with these exams

01:27:22.884 --> 01:27:25.887
and first-class honours
and universities being a qirl.

01:27:26.977 --> 01:27:31.453
But still... congratulations...

01:27:32.098 --> 01:27:33.618
You've done very well.

01:27:34.306 --> 01:27:36.031
Thanks, dad.

01:27:38.538 --> 01:27:40.729
So, what do you want to do now?

01:27:41.668 --> 01:27:43.609
You know what I want to do.

01:27:44.454 --> 01:27:47.311
Well, I'll think about it...
If you get that scholarship.

01:27:47.376 --> 01:27:50.448
Oh, she'll get it all right,
with that pass.

01:27:50.513 --> 01:27:54.742
Well, if you do, I'll think about
you going to university, okay?

01:27:55.962 --> 01:27:58.383
But, if I do decide you can go,

01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:00.540
I don't ever want to hear
you mixed up with these...

01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:03.211
Libertarians and those bloody
communists they've got there,

01:28:03.337 --> 01:28:06.324
you'll be out of this house
in a shot, understood?

01:28:06.389 --> 01:28:07.579
Yes, dad.

01:28:09.699 --> 01:28:12.711
- Telephone rings]
- Oh, I'll get it.

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:16.457
What's this?

01:28:16.986 --> 01:28:21.477
On! That's, uh, salami.
Lisa suggested it.

01:28:22.017 --> 01:28:24.508
All those bloody reffos
she's got to know.

01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:32.536
Hun! Salami, en?

01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:34.720
Eeckon I could get used to that.

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:37.108
We out of beer?

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:39.947
No, Lisa suggested that too.

01:28:46.194 --> 01:28:47.229
Huh!

01:28:48.509 --> 01:28:50.300
It was Michael Foldes.

01:28:50.657 --> 01:28:52.124
Who's he”?
What does he want?

01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:53.710
He passed the exams too.

01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:56.141
He wanted to know if I'm
doing anything tonight.

01:28:56.396 --> 01:28:57.871
Well, of course you are!

01:28:58.783 --> 01:29:00.453
We're going out to
celebrate, aren't we?

01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:02.672
A slap-up meal in Chinatown.
What do ya reckon?

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:05.277
- Oh, dad!
- Crikey.

01:29:08.111 --> 01:29:09.664
It's hard to keep
up with you, Lesley!

01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:14.579
- Lisa!
- Lisa. Oh, God, what next?!

01:29:15.986 --> 01:29:19.166
And have a look at ya.
Just have a look at ya.

01:29:20.322 --> 01:29:22.124
Not bloody bad, hey!

01:29:23.999 --> 01:29:25.142
Not bad.

01:29:36.825 --> 01:29:37.970
Fay!

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.890
- Sorry!
- That's alright.

01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:49.168
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

01:30:50.026 --> 01:30:53.589
I want your expert opinion.

01:31:12.208 --> 01:31:16.629
You see...
There are harbour views

01:31:22.263 --> 01:31:24.754
maybe you will
dislocate your neck,

01:31:24.819 --> 01:31:27.393
but there are harbour views.

01:31:35.527 --> 01:31:37.172
What do you think?

01:31:38.028 --> 01:31:42.089
Well, I think it's...
I think it's really lovely.

01:31:42.954 --> 01:31:45.851
But it's you who
has to like it it's.

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:50.502
I mean, it's your flat.
What do you think?

01:31:50.567 --> 01:31:53.933
Oh, you... misunderstand me...

01:31:57.385 --> 01:32:01.283
Oh, you mean...
You mean it's for me.

01:32:02.388 --> 01:32:04.744
- Just like Mr Marlow, I, un...
- Fay...

01:32:04.809 --> 01:32:06.496
- I stay here Ana you...
- Fay.

01:32:06.561 --> 01:32:09.199
- You visit and...
- Fay! Don't be bloody silly!

01:32:09.309 --> 01:32:11.277
Not like Mr bloody Marlow!

01:32:11.372 --> 01:32:13.446
There, don't I sound like
a true Australian?

01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:14.455
- No"?
- No.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.369
No, this is for you.

01:32:16.598 --> 01:32:21.738
For me. For. Us.

01:32:23.703 --> 01:32:25.724
I want you to marry me.

01:32:27.716 --> 01:32:31.685
- Marry?
- Marry.

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.860
Marry me”!

01:32:35.715 --> 01:32:40.289
But I... I, I mean, I dont,
I don't know anything about...

01:32:40.419 --> 01:32:44.268
- Books, or m-music, or a-art or...
- Bugger that, Fay!

01:32:44.333 --> 01:32:46.620
- Opera or...
- Fay, Fay, Fay, you're honest.

01:32:47.388 --> 01:32:51.210
And sweet and beautiful,
and I'm going to...

01:32:51.325 --> 01:32:53.609
love teaching you all
about back and Mozart,

01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:55.747
and I love you!

01:32:57.945 --> 01:32:59.670
I adore you.

01:33:04.294 --> 01:33:06.598
Think about it for
as long as you like.

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:08.433
I will give you
five minutes at least

01:33:08.498 --> 01:33:11.166
- shall I leave you alone...
- No., no, no, no! Don't leave me.

01:33:15.129 --> 01:33:18.613
the answer... is yes!

01:33:19.247 --> 01:33:21.190
- Yes, I will!
- Yes!

01:33:31.027 --> 01:33:32.403
Yes!

01:33:36.734 --> 01:33:39.836
- That was Rudi on the telephone.
- Oh?

01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:43.837
He wants to borrow
50 pounds from me.

01:33:44.684 --> 01:33:47.364
Oh... why?

01:33:48.286 --> 01:33:51.597
Oh, he wants to buy a
diamond ring, or a sapphire.

01:33:51.934 --> 01:33:54.589
On, is he going into
the jewellery business?

01:33:54.654 --> 01:33:56.523
Mm I don't think so.

01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:59.597
He wants to buy an
engagement ring for Fay.

01:34:03.614 --> 01:34:06.237
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

01:34:06.465 --> 01:34:11.691
- Uh... engagement ring for Fay?
- Uh-huh... yeah.

01:34:11.927 --> 01:34:15.613
Stefan...
Could you pour me a whiskey?

01:34:15.753 --> 01:34:17.136
All right!

01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:23.254
The whole thing is preposterous.

01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:26.088
How can they possibly
be happy together?

01:34:26.153 --> 01:34:29.749
Hey have absolutely
nothing in common.

01:34:29.814 --> 01:34:30.942
At all

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:32.001
well, having things in common

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:34.643
is not a condition
for a happy marriage.

01:34:34.708 --> 01:34:38.017
The point is that they are
happy together.

01:34:39.536 --> 01:34:40.875
It's only the beginning.

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.800
The middle and the end must
take care of themselves

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:46.099
at least he has not
been trifling with her.

01:34:46.164 --> 01:34:48.345
Not breaking her heart
as I feared

01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:50.859
but he could do, in future.

01:34:52.114 --> 01:34:55.078
I'm happy for them.
I wish them well

01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:58.876
- still something of a shock.
- Well.

01:34:58.941 --> 01:35:00.721
One's friends can be shocking.

01:35:00.786 --> 01:35:03.385
It's one of their
appealing features.

01:35:35.479 --> 01:35:37.045
It 1s not here.

01:35:41.013 --> 01:35:45.351
Never let sentiment
interfere with business.

01:35:46.013 --> 01:35:49.916
To be sentimental about
business is to be weak,

01:35:49.981 --> 01:35:51.996
and to be weak is to tail.

01:35:52.098 --> 01:35:53.810
Do you understand'.

01:35:54.455 --> 01:35:56.339
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Yeah.

01:35:56.513 --> 01:36:00.646
So a man came to buy
a present for his daughter.

01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.153
And he liked
the dress very much.

01:36:03.373 --> 01:36:05.996
- So...
- So he got it for 50 guineas.

01:36:06.067 --> 01:36:09.349
I had given the dress to Yvonne,

01:36:09.414 --> 01:36:10.544
to be wrappea...

01:36:10.665 --> 01:36:15.458
And he was telling me how happy
it would make his daughter.

01:36:15.835 --> 01:36:17.424
- And...
- And?

01:36:17.489 --> 01:36:21.962
And I told him that Yvonne had
made a big mistake and, um...

01:36:22.141 --> 01:36:25.293
That the dress haa
already been sold.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:31.964
And never again will sentiment
interfere with business

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:33.467
I swear it!

01:36:37.494 --> 01:36:38.889
Here it is.

01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:45.284
Oh, but, but Magda,
it's still 50 guineas and...

01:36:45.442 --> 01:36:47.418
I don't have that much money.

01:36:48.473 --> 01:36:50.908
Miss Cartwright
came here yesterday,

01:36:50.973 --> 01:36:54.310
and she reduced all the
unsold dresses even further.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.699
- To?
- Thirty five guineas.

01:36:57.984 --> 01:36:59.210
Oh, Magda!

01:36:59.868 --> 01:37:02.897
Thirty five guineas?
1 have, um, the ten from dad,

01:37:02.962 --> 01:37:07.467
and my savings and the staff
discount... I have 35 guineas!

01:37:12.241 --> 01:37:16.678
Perhaps you will be a business
woman. There are worse things.

01:37:21.164 --> 01:37:24.048
Everything seems to be going
smoothly, Miss Cartwright.

01:37:24.113 --> 01:37:28.278
True, Mr Ryder, but we'll soon be
losing half of ladies cocktail.

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:30.467
Really? Well...

01:37:30.574 --> 01:37:33.161
Young Lisa will be off
to Sydney university,

01:37:33.226 --> 01:37:35.018
but we always knew
she was only a temp.

01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:37.740
Correct, but... Mrs Williams.

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.341
- Whispersl expecting.
- Expecting?

01:37:41.406 --> 01:37:44.880
She doesn't look...
How do you know?

01:37:45.304 --> 01:37:48.217
Years of observing
ladies in black, Mr Ryder.

01:37:48.527 --> 01:37:50.093
And. Uh, Miss Baines...

01:37:50.196 --> 01:37:52.012
- Yes?
- She's engaged!

01:37:52.343 --> 01:37:53.935
- To a Hungarian.
- Hm!

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.053
She's given us a month's notice.

01:37:56.343 --> 01:38:01.482
There's still Mrs Symbo...
Mrs. Sym... Magda.

01:38:01.835 --> 01:38:04.646
That little boutique
is worth its weight in gold.

01:38:04.842 --> 01:38:07.740
Don't count on her being
around too long, Mr Ryder.

01:38:07.913 --> 01:38:10.097
I've heard she's looking
for premises of her own.

01:38:10.186 --> 01:38:13.443
On, well...
It's not surprising, I suppose.

01:38:14.069 --> 01:38:16.536
Ah, well,
they come and they go.

01:38:17.717 --> 01:38:21.329
At least... there's you and me,
Miss Cartwright.

01:38:21.477 --> 01:38:25.295
We're always here.
We're the constant ones.

01:38:38.094 --> 01:38:40.445
Ahh, sorry, thank you.

01:38:41.205 --> 01:38:44.477
Please...
Welcome come in!

01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:47.316
[Mrs Milesl Thank you,
very much. Thank you.

01:38:47.506 --> 01:38:49.729
Ah, wonderful,
come in, come in.

01:38:49.959 --> 01:38:53.807
Oh...
So lovely to finally meet you!

01:38:53.872 --> 01:38:55.223
- Yeah hi!
- Welcome!

01:38:55.288 --> 01:38:58.021
- Hi! You look lovely.
- Thank you!

01:38:58.264 --> 01:39:04.058
Lisa! Oh, so beautiful,
it looks so wonderful on you.

01:39:04.123 --> 01:39:06.059
- Well, I suppose it does.
- Too right it does.

01:39:06.124 --> 01:39:07.124
Thank you!

01:39:07.202 --> 01:39:09.835
- So, can we please sit?
- Yes, please!

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.652
- Please!
- Take a chair.

01:39:11.717 --> 01:39:14.966
- Here, take this.
- Thank you.

01:39:17.032 --> 01:39:18.510
- Excuse me.
- I think you're there.

01:39:18.575 --> 01:39:20.846
So, I have
arranged a few delicacies.

01:39:20.911 --> 01:39:23.348
Well, I believe that
I arranged them.

01:39:23.413 --> 01:39:26.302
Well, you did. But I arranged
that you arranged them.

01:39:32.089 --> 01:39:34.440
Eva, can you do the honours?

01:39:35.026 --> 01:39:37.447
- Can you do the honours?
- Of course!

01:39:39.054 --> 01:39:41.181
- Ah, thank you!
- Yes.

01:39:41.289 --> 01:39:43.822
I know what they are,
they're olives.

01:39:47.052 --> 01:39:48.052
Fay...

01:39:48.793 --> 01:39:50.884
I have to tell you something...

01:39:52.332 --> 01:39:57.048
We are going to be very rich,
and have lots of children.

01:39:57.627 --> 01:39:59.523
At least four.

01:40:00.392 --> 01:40:02.288
Is that all right with you?

01:40:02.969 --> 01:40:06.400
Yes of course it's.

01:40:12.713 --> 01:40:16.024
- I have found the perfect place.
- Hm?

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:19.578
It's...
In the middle of double bay.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.695
"Magda''s fashions".

01:40:22.357 --> 01:40:24.002
What do you say?

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.882
What can I say?
It is so appropriate!

01:40:27.607 --> 01:40:30.120
I want to show
these Australian ladies

01:40:30.185 --> 01:40:32.958
the meaning of the word "style".

01:40:33.146 --> 01:40:35.129
And “expense?,
I'm sure!

01:40:37.655 --> 01:40:40.912
Oh, forgive me, Mr Miles,
for being inattentive.

01:40:40.977 --> 01:40:43.789
Oh, no worries, mate.
Oh, and it's ed.

01:40:43.854 --> 01:40:45.169
- Ed?
- Yeah, ed.

01:40:45.295 --> 01:40:47.054
Ed, Stefan.

01:40:47.248 --> 01:40:49.036
- Stefan?
- Mm-bhhm_

01:40:49.133 --> 01:40:50.721
Stefan.

01:40:52.086 --> 01:40:53.844
This tastes great, what is it?

01:40:53.974 --> 01:40:56.347
- Oh, duck liver pate.
- Sorry?

01:40:56.432 --> 01:40:57.765
Duck liver.

01:40:58.926 --> 01:41:00.492
Duck liver?

01:41:01.192 --> 01:41:03.345
Hm. Strewtn!

01:41:03.833 --> 01:41:05.235
Just won't think about it

01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.449
if I can take everything
else that's been happening

01:41:07.514 --> 01:41:10.540
I guess I can take
"duck liver", I suppose.

01:41:15.892 --> 01:41:17.758
No more lemonade, Lisa.

01:41:17.876 --> 01:41:21.705
In Hungary, you'd have
been drinking this for years.

01:41:22.087 --> 01:41:25.523
In moderation, of course.

01:41:38.688 --> 01:41:40.215
Now, cheers!

01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:57.070
- So, um. Engineering?
- Engineering, that's right.

01:41:57.259 --> 01:42:01.601
And you?
Arts of course

01:42:02.665 --> 01:42:06.719
Lisa, when you finish university,
what will you be?

01:42:12.071 --> 01:42:15.301
Um...
I'm going to be an actress...

01:42:15.743 --> 01:42:21.682
