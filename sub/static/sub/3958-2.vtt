00:01.086 --> 00:02.710
- I'm happy.

00:03.211 --> 00:03.899
- Yeah.

00:04.881 --> 00:07.382
- You don't have to kiss me because you feel sorry for me.

00:07.607 --> 00:09.211
- I'm kissing you because I want to.

00:09.211 --> 00:11.369
- He's delicious. Too delicious.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.229
- College starts very soon,

00:13.651 --> 00:14.790
do you really want to be the only girl

00:15.133 --> 00:16.586
to turn up with you V-plates intact?

00:17.369 --> 00:18.058
- Is everything ok?

00:18.727 --> 00:20.695
- I've just got a massive headache.

00:21.992 --> 00:22.931
- We're fresh meat babe.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.368
- It's like we're all sitting in a restaurant,

00:24.682 --> 00:26.054
waiting for a delivery, and we're the food.

00:27.607 --> 00:28.619
I'm a mess.

00:29.644 --> 00:32.634
Every week, same old bullshit.

00:38.417 --> 00:40.177
- Come on! Ten to the bloody nine!

00:40.660 --> 00:41.178
- All right!

00:44.773 --> 00:46.615
- I'll be late for bloody work.

00:48.324 --> 00:50.792
How'd your first week go?

00:51.589 --> 00:52.179
- All right.

00:53.168 --> 00:54.318
- English isn't bad.

00:55.079 --> 00:56.179
- The teacher's called Mr Hodgson.

00:56.741 --> 00:57.671
- He swears a little bit, you know,

00:57.929 --> 00:59.544
to try and make himself look cool.

01:00.492 --> 01:01.798
- Performance arts is fine.

01:02.651 --> 01:04.114
- We play this game

01:04.404 --> 01:05.022
where you have to say

01:05.250 --> 01:06.449
"She stood upon the balcony,

01:06.729 --> 01:07.510
inimitably mimicking him hiccuping

01:08.312 --> 01:10.825
and amicably welcoming him in."

01:10.825 --> 01:12.614
- You have to say it as fast as you can.

01:13.237 --> 01:14.456
- I have to sit next to this kid

01:14.456 --> 01:15.957
called Andrew Johnson,

01:16.364 --> 01:17.988
who smells intensely of garlic.

01:18.239 --> 01:19.393
- You know he told me that he has

01:19.612 --> 01:21.896
a garlic baguette for supper every night.

01:21.896 --> 01:24.217
- Do I look different?

01:25.608 --> 01:26.296
- What do you mean?

01:26.560 --> 01:27.486
- I'm all sweating.

01:29.235 --> 01:30.297
- Did I tell you I'm going

01:30.507 --> 01:31.080
for the change?

01:31.629 --> 01:32.937
- You had mentioned it, yeah.

01:34.674 --> 01:36.440
- Bloody, I love this song.

01:37.257 --> 01:38.224
- Oh, come on.

01:39.361 --> 01:40.033
- Mom!

01:40.033 --> 01:42.456
You can't cry to the Spice Girls!

01:43.174 --> 01:45.329
- Not exactly Girl Power is it?

01:46.734 --> 01:48.485
- Hey, d'you reckon they'd let you and me try in?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.734
- Oh yeah, and who would I be?

01:51.287 --> 01:53.164
- Underactive thyroid Spice?

01:53.519 --> 01:55.078
- I could be menopause Spice.

Episode 2: Radar.

03:41.477 --> 03:43.540
- So, how did you figure out

03:43.540 --> 03:44.853
I wasn't going?

03:45.220 --> 03:46.313
- When a parent asks a child

03:46.313 --> 03:48.206
how school was and they give more

03:48.469 --> 03:51.047
than a one-word answer, suspicious.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.508
- And just the way you were.

03:53.508 --> 03:55.207
- My instincts told me

03:55.207 --> 03:56.456
something wasn't quite right.

03:57.843 --> 03:59.236
- Plus they rang me,

03:59.500 --> 04:00.673
told me you have'nt been coming in.

04:02.235 --> 04:03.445
- I told you last week,

04:03.695 --> 04:04.736
I was having a cigarette.

04:04.736 --> 04:05.540
- Where?

04:05.540 --> 04:07.112
- I didn't set the alarm off.

04:07.112 --> 04:09.252
- You were ween by the fire door.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.337
- What can I tell you?

04:11.768 --> 04:13.132
- I know it was you who did it,

04:13.132 --> 04:14.174
and when I get proof...

04:14.174 --> 04:15.472
- Why would I set the alarm off?

04:15.675 --> 04:18.290
- ... and when I get proof, you're in for it.

04:18.290 --> 04:19.760
- I'm not messing about this time.

04:24.667 --> 04:27.237
- Liam, honestly?

04:29.897 --> 04:30.760
- Mrs Earl?

04:33.611 --> 04:35.565
<i>Time to face the music</i>

04:37.085 --> 04:37.668
- So, Rae, what's going on?

04:40.784 --> 04:41.909
- Why have you been skipping classes?

04:43.008 --> 04:44.050
- Something happened?

04:44.709 --> 04:46.231
- No. Nothing happened

04:46.676 --> 04:47.893
- Do you remember about those 
conversations we had,

04:48.178 --> 04:49.551
when you were thinking

04:49.815 --> 04:50.982
about applying?

04:51.193 --> 04:52.290
- You said you thought you were ready

04:52.290 --> 04:53.854
for the stresses of college life.

04:55.488 --> 04:56.398
- When someone asks you a question

04:56.615 --> 04:57.364
you give a response.

04:57.770 --> 04:58.928
- 'Called conversation, Rae.

05:02.891 --> 05:04.828
- Yeah, I remember.

05:04.828 --> 05:05.727
- Well maybe this is a sign

05:05.727 --> 05:06.642
that you're not ready.

05:07.697 --> 05:08.286
- There's an argument to be made

05:08.642 --> 05:09.506
for deferring a year.

05:09.830 --> 05:11.552
- No, please, please don't make me do that,

05:11.552 --> 05:12.566
I don't want that.

05:12.566 --> 05:13.392
That way, you can come back

05:13.392 --> 05:14.205
when you're a bit stronger.

05:14.425 --> 05:15.719
- No, please, it's not what I want.

05:15.719 --> 05:16.862
- Well, why don't you tell me

05:16.862 --> 05:17.803
what you do want?

05:19.361 --> 05:22.112
- I want to be treated 
the same as everyone else.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.516
- Okay, then I'm giving you

05:25.516 --> 05:26.706
a formal warning.

05:27.580 --> 05:28.285
If you break the rules again,

05:28.571 --> 05:29.766
I you misbehave, skip classes,

05:29.766 --> 05:31.196
then we are gonna have to talk seriously

05:31.196 --> 05:33.742
about you deferring.

05:34.394 --> 05:35.424
- Understood?

05:35.424 --> 05:36.477
- Yes.

05:36.477 --> 05:38.038
- And she's sorry, aren't you Rae?

05:40.020 --> 05:41.409
- Yeah.

05:42.304 --> 05:43.541
<i>As Uncle Mark might say,</i>

05:43.928 --> 05:46.115
<i>" I'm fuck fucking sorry?</i>

05:46.456 --> 05:47.927
<i>Fuck the fuck off!"</i>

05:51.066 --> 05:51.802
- There she is.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.582
Where the fuck have you been?

05:54.536 --> 05:55.613
We've been worried about you.

05:56.803 --> 05:57.916
- I thought I was supposed to be

05:58.230 --> 05:59.803
your stereotyped gay best friend.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.629
- Sorry, Chuck.

06:07.209 --> 06:08.582
- Why do you come here, Archie?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.825
- Need the grades to get into Dunham.

06:12.057 --> 06:12.893
- Why do you wanna come here?

06:13.491 --> 06:14.584
- I don't know.

06:18.430 --> 06:19.038
- Wait.

06:19.805 --> 06:21.585
- Are you wearing a rugby top?

06:23.209 --> 06:24.116
- Yeah.

06:27.918 --> 06:30.864
- When did you start smoking?

06:32.835 --> 06:36.020
- Archie! What is going on with you?

06:36.662 --> 06:37.301
- Come on.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.898
- Take a walk with me.

06:43.243 --> 06:44.335
- Surviving in college is all about...

06:44.670 --> 06:46.586
blending in into the background.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.397
- If anyone knows anything

06:49.765 --> 06:50.974
about staying under the radar,

06:51.233 --> 06:52.194
it's uncle Archie.

06:52.494 --> 06:55.085
- You know it's really creepy

06:55.349 --> 06:56.459
when you say that, don't you?

06:57.210 --> 06:57.805
- Noted

06:59.728 --> 07:00.382
- Arch

07:00.992 --> 07:01.983
- Easy Macca.

07:01.983 --> 07:02.837
-Got light?

07:02.837 --> 07:03.794
- Yeah.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.078
- Did you see what Maggie Tolson

07:05.078 --> 07:05.931
was wearing today?

07:05.931 --> 07:07.523
- Well, you could choke a dozen camels

07:08.452 --> 07:10.856
- I wish I was a dozen camels.

07:10.856 --> 07:12.023
- Nice one yeah?

07:12.023 --> 07:12.931
- Nice one mate.

07:17.023 --> 07:19.838
- Look at me.

07:20.195 --> 07:22.183
- There's only one rule, understand?

07:22.183 --> 07:23.087
- Yeah.

07:25.808 --> 07:29.061
- Stay under the radar.

07:34.946 --> 07:37.057
- Wow. What have you ????

07:37.454 --> 07:38.299
On the first day, do you remember

07:38.556 --> 07:39.309
that dress I was wearing?

07:39.574 --> 07:40.579
- And I saw that other girl wearing it?

07:41.369 --> 07:42.737
- Well the other day, I saw two girls

07:42.737 --> 07:43.527
in the same dress.

07:43.745 --> 07:44.433
- And one with nearly

07:44.433 --> 07:45.401
the exact same shoes on.

07:45.828 --> 07:47.149
- I'm not taking chances anymore.

07:47.450 --> 07:48.622
- I hate this place,

07:48.622 --> 07:49.799
it's like I'm invisible.

07:51.357 --> 07:51.824
- Oh my god, this is

07:51.824 --> 07:52.312
Stacey Stringfellow's gang.

07:52.312 --> 07:53.947
- Who's Stacey Stringfellow?

07:54.168 --> 07:55.246
- Rae, if you're in with them,
then you're in.

07:55.246 --> 07:55.887
- In where?

07:55.887 --> 07:56.388
- In with the boys.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.033
- Which boys?

07:57.033 --> 07:57.591
- The fit boys.

07:57.591 --> 07:58.189
- I've got a boyfriend

07:58.189 --> 08:00.045
- Well I haven't.
Hi Stacey!

08:04.325 --> 08:06.308
- Oh my god, she just 
completely blanked me.

08:07.606 --> 08:08.497
- I can't eve, process this.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.317
- He's been looking for you, you know.

08:20.795 --> 08:21.357
<i>College wasn't the only thing</i>

08:21.795 --> 08:22.920
<i>I'd been avoiding </i>

08:23.550 --> 08:24.938
<i>Because od what happened at the caravan</i>

08:25.234 --> 08:26.411
<i>I'd stayed away from him.</i>

08:26.411 --> 08:28.093
<i>I didn't wanna be the girl
who couldn't get undressed</i>

08:28.318 --> 08:29.734
<i>in front of her boyfriend.</i>

08:30.580 --> 08:32.267
<i>I really missed him, and smelling</i>

08:32.482 --> 08:34.452
<i>his jacket was no substitute
whatsoever.</i>

08:35.277 --> 08:36.620
- Finn rang again

08:36.929 --> 08:39.179
- What did you say?

08:39.870 --> 08:40.775
- Well, I didn't know what to say,

08:40.775 --> 08:41.900
so I told him you had

08:42.109 --> 08:42.962
glandular fever.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.212
- What?

08:44.495 --> 08:45.525
- Well, last time when I said

08:45.733 --> 08:47.181
you'd gone to France, you got
a riot cob (?) on.

08:47.588 --> 08:49.050
- That is the most stupid thing...

08:49.050 --> 08:49.735
- Yeah, well

08:49.735 --> 08:50.696
maybe we're not all as good

08:50.696 --> 08:52.790
at lying as you are, Rae.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.431
- Just stop avoiding him!

08:57.901 --> 08:59.716
- I'm not avoiding him.

09:10.151 --> 09:12.839
- You've got through your first full day
at college, okay,

09:13.090 --> 09:15.432
and I'm proud of you.

09:18.018 --> 09:20.558
- You're not gonna cry, are you?

09:20.558 --> 09:21.246
- You just...

09:21.246 --> 09:22.578
- You can't spend your life

09:22.578 --> 09:23.830
running away form stuff.

09:25.768 --> 09:28.057
- There's a history of that
in this family.

09:41.808 --> 09:42.935
<i>My mom was right</i>

09:42.935 --> 09:45.486
<i>about once every three years</i>

09:45.779 --> 09:47.529
<i>But I had a feeling</i>

09:47.529 --> 09:48.888
<i>this was one of those times.</i>

09:55.641 --> 09:56.266
- I was starting to think

09:56.266 --> 09:57.476
you'd left the country.

09:58.829 --> 09:59.977
- Or at least Lincolnshire.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.240
- I thought about it.

10:01.538 --> 10:02.641
- Not... Not that I've missed you

10:02.641 --> 10:03.329
or anything.

10:03.329 --> 10:04.383
- No?

10:05.456 --> 10:07.413
- Okay, I might have thought about you once.

10:08.516 --> 10:09.768
- All right, twice.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.477
- I was gonna come now, actually, but

10:14.800 --> 10:15.945
your mom said something about...

10:15.945 --> 10:16.688
- Listen...

10:17.366 --> 10:18.320
- I was just a bit,

10:19.722 --> 10:20.756
 out of it.

10:21.614 --> 10:22.830
- And I didn't wanna tell you,

10:23.116 --> 10:25.440
because I didn't wanna drag you into it.

10:27.221 --> 10:29.064
- I don't mind that you've got stuff

10:29.853 --> 10:31.924
- Everyone's got stuff, really.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.581
- But...

10:34.895 --> 10:35.769
- All right, lovebirds!

10:36.541 --> 10:37.541
- Where have you been, Raemundo?

10:37.761 --> 10:39.582
- I've been ready to send a sexy 
search party for you.

10:40.144 --> 10:42.287
Yes Chop, a Foster's mate, a nice one.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.307
- But...?

10:57.040 --> 10:57.776
<i>I'd forgotten</i>

10:58.556 --> 11:00.590
<i>I'd forgotten that there's
something in his lips</i>

11:01.433 --> 11:03.651
<i>And no matter how crap my life was,</i>

11:04.091 --> 11:05.996
<i>No matter how much
 I didn't fit in at college,</i>

11:06.370 --> 11:07.058
<i>No matter what,</i>

11:07.451 --> 11:10.807
<i>When I had his lips,
I had his kiss,</i>

11:11.495 --> 11:12.810
<i>and so long as I had that,</i>

11:13.173 --> 11:16.247
<i>I knew everything would be okay.</i>

11:17.778 --> 11:19.683
- My dad is at a conference all week, 
right?

11:20.683 --> 11:22.532
- So I was thinking, about having

11:22.807 --> 11:25.282
an exclusive sleepover tomorrow night

11:26.017 --> 11:27.469
- How exclusive?

11:27.782 --> 11:30.925
- Well, I was only gonna invite 
one person.

11:32.403 --> 11:33.768
- Fancy it?

11:34.407 --> 11:35.029
- Yeah.

11:35.967 --> 11:36.620
- Yeah?

11:37.843 --> 11:38.143
- Yeah!

11:42.121 --> 11:43.224
<i>Day two of college.</i>

11:43.997 --> 11:45.157
<i>if I could get through the day,</i>

11:45.157 --> 11:47.278
<i>I had Finn waiting for me
 that night.</i>

11:48.451 --> 11:50.107
<i>But, staying under the radar
isn't easy</i>

11:50.420 --> 11:51.232
<i>when you're six foot tall</i>

11:51.232 --> 11:52.880
<i>and weigh 16 stone</i>

11:54.753 --> 11:55.579
<i>I had to be...</i>

11:58.484 --> 12:00.639
<i>bland</i>

12:06.663 --> 12:07.548
- This is important

12:08.578 --> 12:09.752
- That is Simmy.

12:10.893 --> 12:12.421
- He's got this almost magical ability

12:12.733 --> 12:14.331
to invent a nickname for someone.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.955
- One that sticks for the rest
of that person't life.

12:18.286 --> 12:20.284
- This kid here, 
he was in Simmy's high school.

12:20.284 --> 12:24.006
In swimming class he got an
unfortunate crease in his trunks.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.283
- Simmy called him "Aquabone".
It stuck.

12:27.578 --> 12:29.546
- It was five years ago.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.195
- Even his dad calls him it.

12:33.006 --> 12:33.828
- This gal here

12:35.695 --> 12:37.047
- Simmy decided she got a big chin.

12:37.707 --> 12:39.396
- She lost a shoe at the year's disco...

12:39.797 --> 12:41.080
"Chinderella".

12:42.452 --> 12:43.080
- That's...

12:44.772 --> 12:46.235
- That's actually quite clever.

12:46.535 --> 12:47.850
- He's an evil genius.

12:48.362 --> 12:50.142
- So trust me, do not do anythin

12:50.142 --> 12:52.658
extraordinary around him.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.271
<i>Don't look!</i>

12:55.444 --> 12:56.846
<i>Why are you looking?</i>

12:57.602 --> 12:59.079
<i>Oh bollocks, here he comes</i>

12:59.448 --> 13:01.196
<i>Look away. Look away!</i>

13:01.416 --> 13:03.707
<i>Look. away!</i>

13:04.037 --> 13:04.520
- Easy, Arch!

13:05.396 --> 13:06.330
- Hi Simmy!

13:08.272 --> 13:08.925
- Hey, did you see this

13:09.159 --> 13:09.979
Graham Tipping's glasses mate?

13:10.644 --> 13:11.617
- Looks like Elton John.

13:12.019 --> 13:12.755
- I doubt Elton John

13:12.755 --> 13:13.737
sleeps on plastic sheets

13:13.737 --> 13:15.095
in case he pisses the bed, eh mate?

13:15.521 --> 13:16.070
- Yeah !

13:18.208 --> 13:19.104
- Look who it is!

13:19.690 --> 13:20.807
- All right, unicorn balls?

13:22.192 --> 13:23.757
- Unicorn balls, 
where are you going man?

13:25.194 --> 13:26.740
- So I thought I'd take this time
to talk about

13:26.960 --> 13:28.777
the power of positive thinking.

13:31.652 --> 13:34.856
- It's about seeing 
the good side of things.

13:36.413 --> 13:40.337
- It's about filling your life
with things that make you happy.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.975
- Sorry, sorry.

13:46.537 --> 13:47.381
- Put up a chair, Liam.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.153
- I was just about to ask the group
if they could think of things

14:13.153 --> 14:14.444
that make them happy.

14:14.696 --> 14:16.501
- Oh! I'll go first.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.854
- Okay.

14:21.118 --> 14:22.791
- Every day I go to Sixth Form college

14:24.356 --> 14:25.230
It's shit.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.357
- It's like being a social experiment,

14:28.429 --> 14:29.948
where they keep a load of people 
in the same building

14:30.573 --> 14:33.258
and the only thing they all have in common
 is their age.

14:33.854 --> 14:35.372
- And because of this, it's populated by

14:35.605 --> 14:36.625
people trying to fit in.

14:37.105 --> 14:38.698
- The teachers push an ideal of us.

14:39.164 --> 14:41.718
- "To excell here or be a failure in life,

14:41.948 --> 14:43.759
learn this 15th century poem

14:44.166 --> 14:46.128
and hypothesize on the significance 
of the French revolution,

14:46.353 --> 14:50.229
or... Be worthless in society."

14:52.574 --> 14:54.094
- I feel hatred towards the whole thing.

14:55.233 --> 14:56.292
- And when I feel that hatred,

14:57.012 --> 14:59.095
I feel happy.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.244
- 'Cause I realize it, that's not me.

15:03.687 --> 15:06.010
- They're not me, and they never will be.

15:06.937 --> 15:10.294
- It make me fucking delirious!

15:18.408 --> 15:20.230
- Il like it on Wednesdays, 
when the cantine serves

15:20.539 --> 15:22.293
the dessert with jelly and custard.

15:22.293 --> 15:22.703
- Oh, yes!

15:23.081 --> 15:24.610
- That trayful thing.

15:24.921 --> 15:25.444
- Oh yeah.

15:33.658 --> 15:34.507
- Hi yeh

15:35.727 --> 15:36.268
- All right?

15:38.724 --> 15:39.673
- I liked your speech.

15:40.877 --> 15:41.923
- I like college as well.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.758
- Like, I just wanted to say...
about the other day,

15:47.758 --> 15:49.707
when I set the alarm off,

15:49.707 --> 15:50.895
it was an accident.

15:50.895 --> 15:52.251
- I didn't see anything.

15:52.470 --> 15:54.036
- You're not gonna say anything are you?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.204
- It's just, 
I'm on a warning at college...

15:56.204 --> 15:57.737
- I didn't see anything.

16:10.019 --> 16:10.884
That's Finn Nelson.

16:11.885 --> 16:12.573
- Yeah?

16:12.895 --> 16:14.925
- He is the fittest lad in college.

16:15.299 --> 16:17.270
- I'd honestly let him 
do anything to me.

16:17.927 --> 16:19.382
- You'd let anyone do anything to you.

16:19.894 --> 16:20.549
- Fuck off!

16:21.019 --> 16:22.111
- The best part is that he's single.

16:22.426 --> 16:23.212
- He's not single.

16:23.535 --> 16:25.230
- What? Who is he going out with?

16:25.566 --> 16:27.229
- Some lucky bitch.

16:30.177 --> 16:31.051
- It doesn't matter anyway,

16:31.864 --> 16:34.362
he wouldn't even talk to girls like us.

16:40.178 --> 16:40.901
<i>This si impossible</i>

16:42.052 --> 16:45.274
<i>How am I supposed to stay 
under the radar</i>

16:45.709 --> 16:48.054
<i>when everyone at college knows
who Finn is?</i>

16:48.835 --> 16:51.116
<i>He's the fittest lad in college.</i>

16:51.629 --> 16:54.440
<i>And I'm... I'm...</i>

16:57.757 --> 16:58.252
- Chloe...

16:59.911 --> 17:03.448
- How weird is it, that I'm
going out with Finn?

17:04.121 --> 17:04.800
- You know...

17:05.881 --> 17:07.972
- No, be honest.

17:08.410 --> 17:10.351
- Right, okay.
Out of ten,

17:10.351 --> 17:11.557
how attractive would you say you were?

17:11.801 --> 17:12.472
- One

17:12.973 --> 17:13.898
- Don't be stupid!

17:15.070 --> 17:16.409
- You're reasonably a four.

17:17.051 --> 17:17.692
- Thanks!

17:18.222 --> 17:19.059
- No I mean...

17:19.059 --> 17:20.630
- I mean like a four at worst.

17:21.506 --> 17:22.434
- You know, when you're hungover

17:22.434 --> 17:23.464
and you ??? and stuff

17:24.348 --> 17:25.098
- Right.

17:25.465 --> 17:26.944
- Fine, Rate Finn out of ten.

17:27.162 --> 17:27.972
- Eleven.

17:27.972 --> 17:30.382
- Exactly.
That isn't even possible.

17:31.744 --> 17:32.717
- Even Emma Coghill's sister fancies him

17:32.717 --> 17:34.771
and she's like 23.

17:35.308 --> 17:36.443
- And she's been with footballers.

17:36.725 --> 17:38.319
- So, why does he like me?

17:38.685 --> 17:40.415
- I don't know. Maybe you're his type,

17:40.819 --> 17:41.585
or something.

17:41.882 --> 17:42.680
- What type would that be?

17:42.680 --> 17:43.619
- Curvacious.

17:43.946 --> 17:44.383
- Stop it!

17:44.383 --> 17:45.539
- And let's be honest

17:45.539 --> 17:46.388
if he like big boobs,

17:46.388 --> 17:47.134
then he struck gold.

17:47.368 --> 17:48.937
- They are cripplingly large.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.469
Anyway, I'm stopping at his tonight

17:52.744 --> 17:54.731
It's about to get happen (?).

17:55.417 --> 17:56.875
- I thought it happened at camping.

17:57.108 --> 17:58.822
- Oh non. No, we didn't...

17:59.290 --> 18:00.447
hum... Because...

18:00.447 --> 18:01.571
- Did he drink too much?

18:01.571 --> 18:02.205
- Yeah.

18:02.205 --> 18:03.206
- You know what, I hate that.

18:03.206 --> 18:03.735
- Yeah.

18:04.123 --> 18:06.468
- Listen, your first time is always 
gonna be the scariest.

18:06.754 --> 18:09.240
- Just, make sure he doesn't drink 
too much and you'll be fine!

18:10.030 --> 18:10.301
- But...

18:10.614 --> 18:12.969
- Rae! For the past four weeks or so
we've talked about sex.

18:13.282 --> 18:16.751
- Right? Noises, positions, worst and
best case scenarios.

18:16.955 --> 18:18.616
Handjobs techniques, blowjob techniques,

18:18.845 --> 18:20.001
- How sensitive men's nipples are.

18:20.427 --> 18:23.498
- Balls's skin, porn, anal, 
even strap-ons!

18:24.009 --> 18:25.968
- There's nothing else to talk about,
right? Just...

18:26.282 --> 18:29.282
- Let him whack it in you!

18:31.742 --> 18:32.190
- Right?

18:33.343 --> 18:33.929
- Right.

18:46.066 --> 18:47.471
- Oh my god, she's here!

18:51.376 --> 18:52.052
- Holy fuck?!

19:06.557 --> 19:07.910
- I told you I was thinking about
doing a photoshoot.

19:08.628 --> 19:10.822
- And then we talked for like, 
hum, ninety hours?

19:11.660 --> 19:14.409
- And then you agreed it was a bad idea.

19:14.679 --> 19:15.180
- I know.

19:15.399 --> 19:17.425
- Why do underwear shots?

19:18.379 --> 19:20.221
- Well I wanted to put it
on my modeling portfolio.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.129
- Oh my God, Rae!
Everybody's staring at me.

19:30.003 --> 19:30.568
- Right.

19:31.411 --> 19:33.616
- Where are the originals? 
And the negatives?

19:34.275 --> 19:34.996
- I don't know.

19:36.573 --> 19:39.317
- No I took them to Lisa Goulding's party
and I haven't seen them since.

19:39.959 --> 19:41.271
- Did you show anyone at the party?

19:46.333 --> 19:47.899
- I got really drunk and I showed them
to Barney.

19:49.194 --> 19:50.616
- No, but there was over 50 people there,

19:50.832 --> 19:52.133
and I didn't know half of them.
It could be anyone.

19:53.739 --> 19:55.429
- Rae, we really need to find out 
who's got the photos

19:55.788 --> 19:57.726
before they print off any new ones.

19:58.746 --> 20:00.307
- What other ones?

20:03.473 --> 20:07.210
- Oh my god, Chloe!
Why would you do that?

20:07.571 --> 20:08.936
- I wanted to keep 
the glamour door open.

20:09.747 --> 20:11.931
Glamour door? You're 16.

20:12.227 --> 20:13.664
There is no door.

20:14.162 --> 20:17.622
- Well have you never not wanted
pictures taken when you look amazing?

20:18.069 --> 20:20.732
- Right? When your hair's done, and
you're make up, and the lighting

20:21.069 --> 20:24.070
and you look sexy?

20:24.915 --> 20:26.289
- Right? You feel sexy.

20:27.933 --> 20:28.653
No?

20:34.164 --> 20:35.404
Please, Rae.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.514
<i>You mess with her,</i>

20:45.973 --> 20:47.499
<i>you mess with me</i>

20:49.469 --> 20:50.097
<i>Poor Chloe</i>

20:50.703 --> 20:52.547
<i>College is utterly barbaric.</i>

20:55.938 --> 20:57.923
<i>At least I'd made it through
the day under the radar,</i>

20:58.298 --> 21:00.061
<i>and now I had Finn all to myself.</i>

21:02.577 --> 21:03.987
<i>I was starting to think 
that me and him</i>

21:03.987 --> 21:06.328
<i>Only made sense when no one else
was around</i>

21:07.453 --> 21:09.017
<i>I still didn't know
why he liked me,</i>

21:09.350 --> 21:11.016
<i>but maybe Chloe had it spot on.</i>

21:11.314 --> 21:12.819
<i>Maybe I was his type.</i>

21:13.430 --> 21:15.376
<i>Now, all I needed 
was a bit of courage.</i>

21:15.612 --> 21:17.315
<i>Courage in any form.</i>

21:19.125 --> 21:20.065
- You want it tonight, girl?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.704
- No, I just fancied a drink.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.329
- Want some?

21:24.553 --> 21:25.644
- No, I'm fine.

21:28.801 --> 21:29.424
- Cheers, my dear.

21:30.307 --> 21:30.941
- Cheers.

21:42.531 --> 21:43.312
<i>You can do this.</i>

21:43.766 --> 21:45.810
<i>The first time is always 
the scariest. Man up!</i>

21:53.772 --> 21:54.585
- Where is this one?

21:55.978 --> 21:59.371
- Um, that is Butlins and Skegness.

22:00.639 --> 22:01.648
- I think I was five.

22:06.416 --> 22:07.494
- Is that your mom?

22:09.212 --> 22:10.198
- That''s her, yeah.

22:11.120 --> 22:11.760
- She's pretty.

22:12.369 --> 22:12.807
- Yeah.

22:13.821 --> 22:14.684
- Do you miss her?

22:16.539 --> 22:17.795
- Yeah.

22:25.391 --> 22:26.650
- Who is this?

22:27.121 --> 22:31.103
- Oh God!
This is Stacey Stringfellow.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.402
- She goes to college

22:33.110 --> 22:34.807
- Right, so, why have you got this?

22:35.401 --> 22:36.496
- We used to go out.

22:38.673 --> 22:41.121
- I told you it's been ages since 
someone looked at these.

22:41.462 --> 22:43.089
- I'll throw that one out.

22:43.089 --> 22:45.682
- No. It's no big deal.

22:46.122 --> 22:47.628
- Everyone's got exes.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.044
- Have a drink.

23:00.528 --> 23:02.528
- No, I'm fine, seriously.

23:09.590 --> 23:13.187
<i> Just relax, just relax, 
just relax.</i>

23:13.623 --> 23:14.482
<i>He wants this</i>

23:15.246 --> 23:16.186
<i>You want this.</i>

23:18.361 --> 23:20.327
- Right, I'm pouring you one.

23:20.561 --> 23:22.153
- Oh... Really?

23:26.984 --> 23:28.020
- Cheers, my dear.

23:47.906 --> 23:49.396
- No, no, no more.

23:49.396 --> 23:50.279
- Just one more.

23:59.248 --> 24:00.030
- Cheers, my dear.

24:00.295 --> 24:02.155
- Yep. Cheers, my dear.

24:06.218 --> 24:08.546
- I'm gonna... hum... I think I...

24:10.321 --> 24:13.033
- I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

25:10.104 --> 25:11.397
- I had a freak out

25:12.551 --> 25:14.138
- I accidentally set an alarm off.

25:16.021 --> 25:17.244
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

25:17.616 --> 25:18.415
- They'll kick me out.

25:18.757 --> 25:20.197
- Kester, promise me.

25:21.301 --> 25:22.100
- Of course, I won't.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.327
- What were you doing, at the time?

25:26.693 --> 25:27.454
- Tell me about that.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.832
- Hum... I was just walking 
down the corridor.

25:33.566 --> 25:34.338
- Alone?

25:34.899 --> 25:35.315
- Yeah.

25:37.902 --> 25:44.143
- No, I was... I was with Finn

25:44.551 --> 25:45.247
- Your boyfriend?

25:45.776 --> 25:46.255
- Yeah.

25:48.149 --> 25:49.785
- I don't get why he likes me.

25:52.473 --> 25:53.943
- I'm not even his type.

25:53.943 --> 25:56.911
- His ex was so tiny and beautiful.

25:58.552 --> 26:00.410
- It's embarassing to be next to him.

26:03.006 --> 26:05.006
- I'm embarassed for him.

26:07.350 --> 26:09.692
- So do you think, you can't believe

26:09.692 --> 26:11.239
he likes you because you can't find

26:11.239 --> 26:12.816
anything to like about yourself?

26:15.019 --> 26:16.617
- That's what we're trying to fix.

26:17.257 --> 26:18.413
- Well that takes ages.

26:18.879 --> 26:20.318
- I need a short term solution.

26:20.618 --> 26:22.615
- This is therapy, there are
no short term solutions.

26:25.740 --> 26:28.091
- Fine. Short term, 
you've got three options.

26:29.303 --> 26:32.695
- One, you start facing those things
 you're afraid of.

26:33.038 --> 26:35.428
- Stop caring about what other people 
think, start to like yourself.

26:37.695 --> 26:40.154
- Option two, you could leave college.

26:40.427 --> 26:43.101
- Nope, I can't do that.
What's option three?

26:43.508 --> 26:44.415
- Leave Finn.

26:46.981 --> 26:50.007
- I guess I'll just try option one then.

26:51.165 --> 26:52.039
- Yeah.

26:52.915 --> 26:53.334
- Yeah.

27:00.415 --> 27:03.219
<i>As always, Kester was 
annoyingly right.</i>

27:03.883 --> 27:06.230
<i>The only real option was 
to face my fears.</i>

27:06.727 --> 27:08.496
<i>I had to be around Finn in college,</i>

27:08.793 --> 27:11.164
<i>not just to help my anxieties,
but also</i>

27:11.481 --> 27:14.337
<i>because a circle of vultures 
was gathering over his head.</i>

27:17.274 --> 27:19.209
Do it. Just kiss him. Fuck it.

27:19.755 --> 27:21.942
- Just, just kiss him. Ok.

27:23.307 --> 27:23.965
- Are you Rae?

27:24.495 --> 27:25.205
- Yeah.

27:26.277 --> 27:27.520
- There's a rumor going round about you.

27:28.392 --> 27:28.838
- What?

27:29.372 --> 27:30.485
 - Are you going out with someone?

27:38.611 --> 27:39.146
- No.

27:40.136 --> 27:40.768
- Told you.

27:50.301 --> 27:51.112
<i>I can't do it.</i>

27:51.589 --> 27:52.965
<i>I can't be near him at college.</i>

27:53.559 --> 27:54.841
<i>The vultures can circle.</i>

27:55.716 --> 27:57.870
<i>I'd rather hide than be eaten alive.</i>

27:58.497 --> 27:59.779
<i>I'd still be his girlfriend,</i>

28:00.310 --> 28:02.093
<i>just part time.</i>

28:41.348 --> 28:42.660
- Do you have any idea who's got them?

28:43.068 --> 28:46.181
- No. Everyone's been 
really nice about it.

28:47.630 --> 28:49.302
- I've actually been asked out
by a few of the lads.

28:49.692 --> 28:50.309
- Seriously?

28:50.628 --> 28:52.854
- I know. It's so inappropriate, but...

28:53.836 --> 28:55.176
but that's lads for you I guess.

28:55.723 --> 28:56.410
- Hey, Chlo.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.191
- Hey Stacey. Was it a good game?

28:58.490 --> 28:59.567
- Oh! Brutal.

29:00.175 --> 29:01.294
- So I'll see you later still?

29:01.507 --> 29:02.414
- Yeah, definitely.

29:05.984 --> 29:07.464
- What just happened?

29:09.233 --> 29:10.997
- Well the girls have actually been 
really supportive.

29:11.526 --> 29:14.027
- Stacey even asked if I wanted to go 
for a bite to eat after college.

29:14.746 --> 29:15.497
- How nice is that?

29:17.699 --> 29:20.168
- I don't know, I'm just hoping
whoever's got the pictures will stop.

29:20.650 --> 29:22.266
- It will all go away anyway, so...

29:22.510 --> 29:23.673
- Why would it all go away?

29:24.277 --> 29:25.826
- We need to find out who it is.

29:26.370 --> 29:27.527
- Or at least tell a teacher.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.017
- Just drop it Rae, 'cause I don't
wanna talk about it, ok?

29:30.839 --> 29:31.515
- Ok?

30:08.376 --> 30:09.529
- Good afternoon.

30:10.687 --> 30:11.091
- Is it?

30:11.863 --> 30:15.250
- Listen, Rae. I need to talk to you
about something.

30:16.195 --> 30:17.148
- Big news.

30:17.593 --> 30:18.969
- I'm going through the change.

30:19.343 --> 30:20.341
- Oh, God.

30:20.592 --> 30:22.936
- And I'm thinking of getting
some work done.

30:24.499 --> 30:25.295
- What work?

30:25.765 --> 30:27.178
- Cosmetic surgery.

30:32.199 --> 30:33.982
- Are you actually insane?

30:34.856 --> 30:36.292
- How can we even afford that?

30:36.805 --> 30:40.742
- You know last week, you said that
I could only throw a teabag away

30:40.960 --> 30:43.851
after it had made three cups of tea.

30:44.669 --> 30:46.934
- So all week, I've been trying 
to save you money

30:47.364 --> 30:52.944
by drinking tea that looks and tastes
like ass piss,

30:53.489 --> 30:57.433
and now, you wanna go and throw away
thousands of pounds

31:02.299 --> 31:04.863
- No bloody way, mom.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.377
- Don't cry.

31:14.645 --> 31:16.070
- You were doing so well.

31:21.430 --> 31:22.160
- I do.

31:23.394 --> 31:28.769
- I just want... I just want Karim
to be attracted to me.

31:30.790 --> 31:33.822
- I'm punching well above my weight
with him, Rae.

31:35.051 --> 31:39.365
- And it's not just that he's handsome 
either, or that he's got this firm
little body on him.

31:39.989 --> 31:42.540
- He is sensational in bed.

31:43.124 --> 31:44.895
- He attends to my every need.

31:45.271 --> 31:49.100
- And I feel like I've been taken
by a man, posessed...

31:49.100 --> 31:50.053
- Yeah I get it!

31:50.349 --> 31:52.505
- He's hot. You like him.

31:54.304 --> 31:58.645
- When we're at the club, I feel people
must look at us and think...

32:00.036 --> 32:01.835
How the bloody hell did that happen?

32:02.958 --> 32:04.272
- You know what I mean?

32:11.323 --> 32:12.354
- Yeah

32:17.158 --> 32:18.378
- Do you want a brew?

32:22.920 --> 32:23.357
- Rae.

32:25.231 --> 32:27.004
Use one teabag per cup.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.628
<i>So maybe I wasn't ready</i>

32:34.920 --> 32:35.942
<i>to be around Finn in college,</i>

32:36.410 --> 32:37.813
<i>but I had to see him outside.</i>

32:38.639 --> 32:39.895
<i>Or what was the point?</i>

32:41.075 --> 32:41.785
<i>and that meant,</i>

32:42.330 --> 32:43.630
<i>taking my clothes off.</i>

32:46.567 --> 32:47.358
<i>But the truth was,</i>

32:48.579 --> 32:51.204
<i>that I was astounded by people
who could be naked.</i>

32:53.108 --> 32:54.484
<i>Not just in front of others,</i>

32:55.913 --> 32:57.153
<i>but in front of themselves.</i>

32:59.702 --> 33:00.856
<i>If I couldn't do that,</i>

33:01.626 --> 33:04.156
<i>How could I ever do it in front
of someone else?</i>

33:06.672 --> 33:10.942
<i>The problem is, that being naked
leaves you nowhere to hide.</i>

33:22.673 --> 33:24.235
- I just don't get it.

33:28.688 --> 33:29.547
- Oh fuck.

33:30.828 --> 33:32.471
- Rae! Hi!

33:34.549 --> 33:36.297
- Oh, hey!

33:36.594 --> 33:37.251
- Where have you been?

33:37.847 --> 33:38.202
- About.

33:39.989 --> 33:41.874
- Humm... I've gotta go.

33:42.148 --> 33:42.513
- What?

33:43.305 --> 33:45.869
- Stop. Look. What are you doing?

33:46.203 --> 33:47.450
- Can we not do this here, Finn?

33:48.041 --> 33:48.837
- Do what?

33:50.714 --> 33:51.868
"OUT OF ORDER"

33:52.640 --> 33:53.368
- Why are you being a dickhead?

33:53.716 --> 33:54.570
- Don't call me a dickhead.

33:54.775 --> 33:55.994
- You've been ignoring me, 
deny it.

33:58.370 --> 33:58.673
- What? Is it...

33:59.844 --> 34:00.555
- Is it cause of the other night?
