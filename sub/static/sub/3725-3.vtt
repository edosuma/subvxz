00:02.694 --> 00:07.306
I believe I'd like to get to
know His Excellency better.

00:07.392 --> 00:09.754
People won't forget what you're doing here.

00:09.784 --> 00:12.282
- Aim!
- Remember the Alamo.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.252
Remember the Alamo!

00:14.282 --> 00:15.796
Fire!

00:19.220 --> 00:20.803
Houston is on the run!

00:22.390 --> 00:24.306
Private Lamar, we had a crisis

00:24.392 --> 00:26.766
with our gutless Commander.

00:26.796 --> 00:28.644
We need to get an urgent message

00:28.730 --> 00:30.335
to the Secretary of War.

00:30.365 --> 00:31.619
Señor Flores,

00:31.649 --> 00:33.182
I need a volunteer to infiltrate

00:33.268 --> 00:34.567
Santa Anna's camp.

00:34.652 --> 00:37.070
Find out if Emily West is there.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.748
Our cause is lost, damn it.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.784
The only-est thing we're gonna
find in Texas is our graves.

00:47.144 --> 00:49.736
I'm interested in a land grant.

00:49.766 --> 00:52.001
Honest settlers have nothing to fear.

00:52.287 --> 00:56.539
President Santa Anna protects
all legal land owners.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.340
If you want to kill Santa Anna,

00:58.476 --> 01:00.226
you will need this.

02:40.190 --> 02:41.382
This is our house?

02:41.412 --> 02:42.750
A new beginning, darling.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.501
We're really gonna live here?

02:44.531 --> 02:46.484
- Well, it looks like it.
- It's so big!

02:46.514 --> 02:48.200
- All ours.
- Nobody else's.

02:48.285 --> 02:49.451
Look over there!

02:49.536 --> 02:51.876
We got a fresh start.

02:51.906 --> 02:54.273
Someone's foreclosure is our opportunity.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.910
Whoa, ho, ho, ho.

02:58.028 --> 02:59.278
Is this really ours?

02:59.363 --> 03:01.177
Well...

03:01.207 --> 03:02.401
It's our home.

03:05.954 --> 03:07.485
Lucas, wait!

03:14.862 --> 03:16.407
Thank Jesus.

03:16.437 --> 03:17.555
It's our good fortune.

03:17.585 --> 03:19.665
Look what I found, Mama!

03:19.783 --> 03:21.617
Oh, she's gorgeous, just like you.

03:21.752 --> 03:23.859
My little baby doll.

03:23.889 --> 03:26.364
Come on! Look at here! Come on!

03:26.394 --> 03:28.874
- Don't...
- Come on!

03:31.759 --> 03:33.626
James.

03:34.538 --> 03:36.987
Don't get excited yet.

03:43.403 --> 03:44.556
Come here, you little pup.

03:44.586 --> 03:46.558
Come here.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.399
Keeper.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.462
What do we got here, huh?

03:50.597 --> 03:52.097
What do we got here?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.021
James?

04:03.060 --> 04:06.182
Isn't it strange someone
would leave all this?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.682
Yeah.

04:18.305 --> 04:20.158
Well, don't go jinxing us now, woman.

04:20.209 --> 04:23.684
It's bad luck to question good fortune.

04:23.714 --> 04:26.041
'Course, darling.

04:37.954 --> 04:39.900
I need Santa Anna's exact location.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.313
I want you ride back out there.

04:41.398 --> 04:43.640
You see any movement, I want you
to hightail it back, you hear me?

04:43.670 --> 04:45.923
- Yes, sir.
- Very good.

04:47.146 --> 04:49.350
General Houston.

04:50.889 --> 04:54.493
Details of Santa Anna's military movements.

04:58.419 --> 05:00.821
He's divided his army.

05:00.851 --> 05:02.022
Finally.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.135
Miss West gave you this?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.553
Yes, sir.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.605
San Jacinto.

05:08.943 --> 05:11.727
And she wanted you to have this.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.232
Very well.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.650
Get yourself something to eat.

05:18.736 --> 05:19.952
Yes, sir.

06:20.712 --> 06:23.461
Come on, boy. Come on.

06:33.944 --> 06:35.861
- Ephraim.
- Yeah.

06:35.946 --> 06:39.365
You don't mind if I call you
by your Christian name, do you?

06:39.395 --> 06:41.116
You may notice fellas around here

06:41.201 --> 06:43.285
call me a lot worse than that.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.559
You can call me whatever you want.

06:45.589 --> 06:47.943
Just don't call me late for supper.

06:47.973 --> 06:49.842
If'n we don't take care of ourselves,

06:49.872 --> 06:51.843
who will, right?

06:51.929 --> 06:53.679
Damn straight.

06:53.764 --> 06:55.814
You know, I always say,

06:55.849 --> 06:58.195
what is so awful and wrong

06:58.225 --> 07:01.896
doing whatever we have do to
survive these troublesome times?

07:01.926 --> 07:03.605
Right? Right?

07:03.691 --> 07:05.602
Yeah.

07:05.632 --> 07:07.721
What if I told you I knew of a way

07:07.751 --> 07:11.029
that you would never have
to worry about money again?

07:13.584 --> 07:16.321
You planning on robbing
yourself a bank or something?

07:30.392 --> 07:34.308
Good God Almighty.

07:34.338 --> 07:35.887
You really do have yourself

07:35.973 --> 07:39.591
a plan to rob a bank, don't you?

07:39.676 --> 07:41.259
Well...

07:41.395 --> 07:43.758
Well, shit.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.108
Let me guess, General.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.239
We're retreating again today.

07:54.324 --> 07:56.241
All that retreating's gonna wear him out.

07:56.326 --> 07:59.077
He needs a nap.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.280
You boys ever been to Galveston?

08:02.416 --> 08:03.915
That's the port I sailed into.

08:04.001 --> 08:05.405
There's a bank there, gentlemen.

08:05.435 --> 08:07.152
Tell 'em about the bank there, Gator.

08:07.270 --> 08:10.355
- Tell 'em.
- Banco de Commercia.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.940
Merchants betting on Texas set it
up to the finance the revolution.

08:13.970 --> 08:15.994
Right, Gator says it's
just ripe for the taking.

08:16.113 --> 08:19.314
It's pretty near, what, 100,000
in gold bullion? That right?

08:19.344 --> 08:21.333
Aw, you're joshin'.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.658
He's joshin'.

08:24.688 --> 08:27.189
It'll be a while before we get there.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.357
You got time to think about it.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.882
Ah. Got you.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.597
Massacre!

10:22.655 --> 10:24.594
No. Mister.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.958
Please.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.059
Amigos.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.341
To this day it surprises me

11:16.426 --> 11:19.024
I've become the president of Mexico.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.290
Why's that?

11:24.014 --> 11:26.677
There are so many other
things I could have done.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.188
Like becoming a musician.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.954
So what instruments you play?

11:34.711 --> 11:37.996
I never had time to learn one.

11:38.081 --> 11:42.116
But I'm very sensitive
to all types of music.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.735
It moves me profoundly.

11:45.689 --> 11:48.022
I might as well have been a painter

11:48.108 --> 11:50.191
or a sculptor.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.496
Poet.

11:52.864 --> 11:55.063
I love poetry.

11:58.068 --> 12:01.285
But God in His wisdom decreed

12:01.371 --> 12:03.538
I should serve my country instead.

12:14.634 --> 12:20.364
So I guess, if you're asking
what instrument I play best...

12:22.258 --> 12:24.143
my answer is...

12:25.228 --> 12:27.472
the human instrument.

12:35.021 --> 12:39.907
I hear they call you
the Napoleon of the West.

12:42.162 --> 12:46.447
After I defeated the Spanish at Veracruz,

12:46.533 --> 12:50.023
the Texas Telegraph
started calling me that.

12:51.337 --> 12:55.311
I have fought and won more
battles than Bonaparte.

12:57.975 --> 13:00.628
Mexican War of Independence,

13:00.713 --> 13:04.632
is that much different from
what the Texans are doing?

13:04.717 --> 13:07.218
But of course. Texas is our land.

13:07.303 --> 13:08.386
Your Excellency.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.349
The Anglos are the invaders.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.333
I just fight for the liberty of my people.

13:15.363 --> 13:17.195
Your Excellency.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.179
You are needed.

13:21.096 --> 13:23.392
I'm sorry. It's important.

13:50.647 --> 13:52.146
They are frightened.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.759
Lorca, they say, have risen from
the dead of the Alamo and Goliad.

13:55.789 --> 13:57.485
They believe his spirit comes for you

13:57.604 --> 14:00.438
and brings death to everyone around you.

14:00.490 --> 14:02.607
It's a stupid Indian legend.

14:02.692 --> 14:05.076
It's a peasant superstition.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.325
But it's taking hold.

14:15.713 --> 14:17.038
Señor, por favor.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.257
Señor.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.288
On your feet.

14:31.387 --> 14:33.588
This is not the work of a ghost

14:33.618 --> 14:35.890
or a demon!

14:35.975 --> 14:38.286
This is the work of a man!

14:40.146 --> 14:41.770
Just a man.

14:49.895 --> 14:52.773
Get those men down from there.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.393
We need to talk to him. We need his help.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.511
- Don't worry.
- I'll come with you.

15:13.563 --> 15:17.487
- We'll talk to him right now.
- All right.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.920
Beg pardon.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.481
But I gave these people my word

15:26.511 --> 15:29.443
I'd take them across the Sabine.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.632
Thing is, Comanche are on the
war trail to the north of us,

15:33.767 --> 15:35.793
and the Mexican army's
loose between the coast

15:35.823 --> 15:38.719
and God-knows-where,
coming this way.

15:42.476 --> 15:45.360
We believe we'll be
better off with you, sir.

15:45.479 --> 15:48.630
On our own, I'm afraid
these people might die.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.335
I kill Mexicans.

15:56.457 --> 15:59.241
It's hardly a one-man job.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.160
If we got to die, we'd
prefer to go down fighting.

16:02.666 --> 16:05.348
My word is absolute.

16:05.378 --> 16:07.918
No argument from me.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.628
I'm Cole Hornfischer.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.311
I... I never caught yours.

16:19.434 --> 16:21.480
Well, we thank you, sir.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.413
We thank you.

16:36.447 --> 16:38.196
Yeah, we were right.

16:38.282 --> 16:41.366
Ankle's sprained, not broke.

16:41.853 --> 16:44.591
Cuts and bruises about all healed up.

16:44.621 --> 16:46.738
Told you the doc could fix you up.

16:46.823 --> 16:49.915
Yeah, pretty soon you'll be able
to run away from this feller.

16:49.945 --> 16:53.517
He was very gallant trying to
relieve me of my embarrassment.

16:53.547 --> 16:56.581
Well, I hope you stay around awhile.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.548
I could use all the help I can get.

17:00.804 --> 17:03.196
Thanks, Doc.

17:09.313 --> 17:10.811
Pardon me, nurse.

17:10.931 --> 17:12.093
Sarah!

17:12.123 --> 17:15.551
I got this real bad ache
I want you to look at.

17:18.001 --> 17:19.521
Have to be in private, though.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.758
- Sarah?
- I can't talk to you.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.443
Hey.

17:25.579 --> 17:26.700
I ain't gonna bite you.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.502
Boy!

17:28.531 --> 17:30.859
Boy, your rudeness appalls me.

17:32.286 --> 17:33.940
Under no circumstances

17:33.970 --> 17:35.720
are you to even look at my daughter.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.338
You understand me?

17:39.810 --> 17:42.844
Unless you're in dire
need of medical attention,

17:42.929 --> 17:46.188
I suggest you just go
on about your business.

17:47.350 --> 17:50.219
I thought this is a free country, sawbones.

17:50.249 --> 17:51.853
Least that's what I'm fighting for.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.989
Just get on out of here. Go on.

17:55.019 --> 17:56.948
Clear out of here!

18:15.045 --> 18:16.344
Hey, you're a Ranger.

18:16.379 --> 18:18.018
Reckon you know all about guns.

18:18.048 --> 18:19.547
I know about a lot of things.

18:19.683 --> 18:20.849
Who the hell are you?

18:20.934 --> 18:22.217
You don't remember?

18:22.302 --> 18:23.852
Name's Colby Pitt.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.221
You and the Rangers swum me
and my sister across the Lupe.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.341
Swum half of Texas across that river.

18:28.371 --> 18:30.115
You trying to break that pistol?

18:30.145 --> 18:32.247
No, sir. It's my daddy's.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.302
Reverend's been keeping care of it.

18:34.332 --> 18:38.538
But seeing as how I'm of
age and my daddy being dead,

18:38.568 --> 18:40.383
he gave it to me to keep.

18:40.413 --> 18:41.569
But the lock won't stay cocked.

18:41.655 --> 18:44.239
You tried taking it to the blacksmith?

18:44.269 --> 18:46.616
You know where I can find him?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.410
Over in that tent there,

18:49.496 --> 18:51.546
snorting like a peach orchard boar.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.797
What do I tell him?

18:52.916 --> 18:55.500
"Fix my damn gun, you lazy son of a bitch."

18:55.585 --> 18:57.252
Tell him you ride with the Rangers.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.337
If he hears that, he'll fix
your pistol straightaway.

18:59.422 --> 19:01.806
Or else, that man... let
me tell you something...

19:01.925 --> 19:03.918
he will know that he can count on

19:03.948 --> 19:06.450
a thoroughbred
ass-whupping. You understand?

19:06.480 --> 19:07.701
- Go on, get.
- Go on.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.750
- Go on.
- Go.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.738
What happened?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.855
He thinks Houston's a blacksmith.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.411
- He's going in there.
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:23.497 --> 19:25.569
Watch, watch, watch.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.096
- Wake up.
- What is it?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.787
I need you to fix this here weapon.

19:32.817 --> 19:35.507
There's something wrong with the mechanism.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.425
Without delay?

19:37.460 --> 19:39.294
I'm a Ranger. Could be
called upon at any moment.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.985
Could use it for the common defense.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.599
Go on, you son of a bitch, fix it!

19:48.471 --> 19:51.023
- General awake?
- General? General Houston?

19:51.053 --> 19:53.813
That's the only general we have, son.

19:54.477 --> 19:55.610
Boy!

19:58.815 --> 20:00.732
- That was quick!
- How'd it work?

20:00.817 --> 20:04.466
- Get it clean?
- He don't look happy.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.456
General Houston, I thought...

20:08.542 --> 20:10.142
I mean...

20:10.172 --> 20:11.659
I'm bust-out sorry
and shame-faced

20:11.745 --> 20:15.063
for disturbing your sleep
like a dumb, stupid idiot.

20:15.093 --> 20:18.508
And I'm prepared to take
the whuppin' I deserve.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.552
Only, um...

20:20.670 --> 20:22.778
Only what?

20:25.179 --> 20:27.199
I'd like my gun back.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.408
Seeing as it was my daddy's
and he was shot down by outlaws.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.940
It's the only thing he left me.

20:42.795 --> 20:44.859
Pawl needs adjusting.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.167
Come back later. You'll
find it serviceable.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.615
Go on.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.655
Shoo!

21:01.977 --> 21:06.082
Since you fine gentlemen have
so much extra time on your hands,

21:06.112 --> 21:07.632
I have an assignment for you.

21:07.717 --> 21:10.183
Sir.

21:10.213 --> 21:11.988
Mount up.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.898
Hyah! Hyah!

21:32.626 --> 21:33.908
Anglos!

21:44.971 --> 21:47.338
Get the wagon! Get the wagon!

21:47.424 --> 21:48.806
Let's go. Let's find some more.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.136
Let's find some more!

21:57.534 --> 22:00.411
_

22:02.407 --> 22:04.782
Whoo!

22:04.868 --> 22:06.584
Nice shot, Knowles.

22:06.669 --> 22:07.873
Here.

22:07.903 --> 22:09.415
Hmm.

22:11.783 --> 22:13.841
Damn it, Beans, why ain't
you pack more vittles?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.710
Didn't have none to pack.

22:15.795 --> 22:18.084
How's Captain Smith expect
us to do our scouting

22:18.114 --> 22:20.698
with bellies like empty saddlebags?

22:24.132 --> 22:26.238
Why don't you go and ask him?

22:26.268 --> 22:28.005
Don't mind if I do.

22:28.057 --> 22:30.224
Give him a piece of my damn mind.

22:30.343 --> 22:32.009
Well, keep it small, Beans.

22:32.061 --> 22:33.677
You ain't got much to spare.

22:33.713 --> 22:34.801
I heard that!

22:34.831 --> 22:37.520
Stupid secret mission so
secret they won't even tell us.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.216
Tired of all this waiting around.

22:39.302 --> 22:41.611
Y'all been chewing on what we talked about?

22:41.641 --> 22:43.938
I don't want to hear no more about it.

22:44.023 --> 22:47.188
You ain't got to make up your
mind till we get to Galveston, Kit.

22:47.218 --> 22:48.726
Already decided.

22:48.811 --> 22:50.528
I ain't no bank robber.

22:53.947 --> 22:56.703
But I ain't no damn snitch neither.

23:05.661 --> 23:10.631
"Only law west of Victoria except God

23:10.716 --> 23:14.168
"can serve as a preacher in a pinch.

23:14.303 --> 23:16.142
"No shooting,

23:16.172 --> 23:17.555
"no cussing,

23:17.640 --> 23:19.173
no fighting, and..."

23:19.258 --> 23:22.780
"And absolutely no spitting
on the god damn floor."

23:22.810 --> 23:24.065
That's my horse.

23:24.095 --> 23:26.647
I wonder if that bitch with
my damn wrist cuff is in there.

23:26.732 --> 23:28.849
You go right, and I'll go left.

23:28.901 --> 23:31.102
All right. I go right; you go left.

23:31.187 --> 23:33.810
- Ow! Whoo!
- That's my girl!

23:33.840 --> 23:35.100
Whoo!

23:38.044 --> 23:39.710
Yeah!

23:39.762 --> 23:41.178
- Play faster!
- Play better!

23:41.264 --> 23:42.546
Play it, fiddle man.

23:42.632 --> 23:44.932
Whoo! Drinks on me, boys.

23:50.940 --> 23:53.643
Give me my wrist cuff, bitch.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.286
Why, you son of a...

24:34.984 --> 24:36.517
Move your ass, Roy!

24:36.602 --> 24:38.102
- Come on, Curls!
- We got to get out of here!

24:38.187 --> 24:39.937
My horse.

24:40.073 --> 24:41.105
Whoo!

24:41.190 --> 24:43.966
They got my damn horse.

24:55.171 --> 24:57.588
- Lucas!
- Watch it now.

24:57.623 --> 24:59.707
- Hey, Nate.
- Stop it!

24:59.792 --> 25:02.435
The first thing we got to
do when it stops raining...

25:02.465 --> 25:05.129
we got to clean out that root cellar.

25:05.181 --> 25:07.131
And we're gonna fix that door.

25:07.183 --> 25:08.432
You and me.

25:08.518 --> 25:10.634
Yes, sir.

25:11.804 --> 25:13.673
All right.

25:15.816 --> 25:17.024
Clean the cellar?

25:17.110 --> 25:19.819
With all the work to be done?

25:19.849 --> 25:21.946
Well, my woman wants her jams and jars

25:21.981 --> 25:24.982
fresh and cool in the summer.

25:25.068 --> 25:27.576
Ain't that right?

25:29.469 --> 25:31.705
Not in front of the children.

25:33.659 --> 25:35.793
Y'all come out of the rain. Supper's ready.

25:35.878 --> 25:37.557
Aw, Ma! Now?

25:37.587 --> 25:39.485
Just keep running.

26:02.081 --> 26:04.544
You do realize, sir, as Secretary of War,

26:04.574 --> 26:07.074
you are empowered to
assume command yourself.

26:07.193 --> 26:10.914
You certainly made me aware
of that, Private Lamar.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.589
Get yourselves a bite to eat.

26:29.599 --> 26:33.467
Well, Rusk will dig Houston's grave now.

26:33.553 --> 26:35.603
I'm most anxious to see his face

26:35.721 --> 26:38.771
when Rusk tears those stars off his uniform

26:38.801 --> 26:41.388
and sends him away.

26:42.145 --> 26:44.478
- Good riddance.
- Good riddance.

26:44.564 --> 26:46.564
Yes.

26:54.736 --> 26:56.490
Sam?

26:56.576 --> 26:58.375
Figured if it wasn't Santa Anna out there

26:58.411 --> 27:01.935
causing all that ruckus, it had to be you.

27:04.584 --> 27:06.550
Come to relieve me, Tom?

27:06.586 --> 27:09.136
It has been discussed.

27:09.255 --> 27:10.921
Well, that's a surprise.

27:11.007 --> 27:13.263
By Burnet?

27:13.293 --> 27:15.476
By just about everybody.

27:15.595 --> 27:19.145
Then do it, then, you son of
a bitch. Let's be done with it.

27:20.383 --> 27:23.517
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

27:23.603 --> 27:26.070
I can't think of one.

27:26.531 --> 27:29.133
'Course I thought you'd defend me.

27:30.997 --> 27:34.497
I have been defending you for
weeks, but nothing's changed.

27:36.441 --> 27:38.584
Sam, the problem is you.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.670
Relieve me of my command, Mr. Secretary,

27:43.756 --> 27:46.340
but do not insult me.

27:46.425 --> 27:48.709
Whoever you put in my place

27:48.844 --> 27:51.044
will still be left

27:51.180 --> 27:53.964
with untrained, undisciplined soldiers

27:54.049 --> 27:57.351
and impudent, disloyal officers.

27:57.436 --> 28:00.220
Sam, you said you'd hold
at Gonzales; you didn't.

28:00.356 --> 28:02.639
You said you'd fight at the Colorado;

28:02.725 --> 28:04.391
you didn't.

28:04.477 --> 28:06.226
You swore to Burnet

28:06.362 --> 28:10.731
that the Mexicans would
never cross the Brazos.

28:10.816 --> 28:12.232
They did.

28:12.284 --> 28:14.618
Burnet, now, there's the man

28:14.737 --> 28:18.071
with all the vision of a rotten stump.

28:18.207 --> 28:22.292
What matters to me, Tom,
is how do you see it?

28:22.788 --> 28:25.574
Do I still have your trust or not?

28:29.468 --> 28:32.336
If all you're gonna give
me are excuses, well, yeah.

28:32.421 --> 28:34.888
You leave me with very little choice, Sam.

28:38.552 --> 28:40.399
Thief ever come back or what?

28:40.786 --> 28:42.429
I'm still hungry.

28:42.515 --> 28:45.232
Yeah? Take this.

28:45.317 --> 28:48.268
Thistle wort, dried chickweed,
bergamot, sassafras...

28:48.354 --> 28:51.605
brew it up, drink it,
you will not feel hungry.

28:51.690 --> 28:55.325
Phew, what the dickens is that right there?

28:55.444 --> 28:57.611
That sassafras will clear your liver

28:57.696 --> 28:59.029
and make you shit like a goose.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.219
That a good thing?

29:00.249 --> 29:02.165
Yeah.

29:02.284 --> 29:06.670
So what's this big secret mission?

29:06.789 --> 29:08.622
Well, we've been ordered to rendezvous

29:08.707 --> 29:10.290
with a couple twin sisters

29:10.426 --> 29:11.708
and escort them back to camp.

29:11.794 --> 29:12.998
Sisters?

29:13.028 --> 29:14.083
Hoo-whee!

29:14.113 --> 29:16.444
Now, finally a task I can get behind.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.420
Well, I'll be damned!

29:25.831 --> 29:28.300
That enough to stop your
whining, get you back to work?

29:28.330 --> 29:29.933
- Yes, cap'n.
- I think so.

29:29.963 --> 29:31.462
Light up a fire and chow down!

29:31.547 --> 29:33.298
Hot damn and hallelujah.

29:33.328 --> 29:34.736
Vern?

29:35.518 --> 29:37.398
Hard ground must be awful rough

29:37.428 --> 29:40.476
on those big feet of yours.

29:40.506 --> 29:42.703
You sure you don't want to take
a turn on Ol' Faithful here?

29:42.733 --> 29:45.948
I'd sooner ride on a spotted river turtle.

29:45.978 --> 29:48.554
We ought to be hightailing to
join up with Sam Houston's army.

29:48.584 --> 29:51.520
Why the hell are we going to Victoria?

29:51.550 --> 29:53.216
I told you.

29:53.302 --> 29:55.958
We need to report them killings
to the proper authorities.

29:55.988 --> 29:57.104
What for?

29:57.189 --> 29:58.689
Somebody's gonna find them soon enough

29:58.824 --> 30:01.456
without us getting all mixed up in it.

30:01.486 --> 30:03.660
We're already mixed up in it.

30:03.746 --> 30:05.829
Besides, you want to get your
horse back, now, don't you?

30:05.915 --> 30:08.582
You think the law is gonna do that for us?

30:08.667 --> 30:10.443
Why not?

30:10.473 --> 30:11.876
It's their job, isn't it?

30:11.906 --> 30:16.173
Hardcase. You got a lot to learn.

30:16.258 --> 30:17.758
How are them blisters?

30:19.042 --> 30:20.711
Come on, hyah! Let's go.

30:20.796 --> 30:24.047
It's best we just head out to
meet up with Houston's army.

30:24.183 --> 30:27.854
Huh... right after we
settle up in Victoria.

30:33.908 --> 30:38.316
I'll bet you boys come
from Buckley's way station.

30:39.288 --> 30:40.974
There was a shooting.

30:44.620 --> 30:48.784
And you gonna tell me you're
all just innocent bystanders.

30:59.353 --> 31:00.519
I'll bet them sisters

31:00.604 --> 31:02.521
are getting all gussied up to meet me.

31:02.573 --> 31:05.445
They gonna catch sight of you
and run a country mile, Beans.

31:05.475 --> 31:07.981
Y'all think they're daughters of some
big Texas politician or something?

31:08.011 --> 31:09.284
How old are these girls?

31:09.314 --> 31:11.846
- Brand spankin' new!
- Whoo, I like 'em young!

31:11.932 --> 31:14.149
Aw, Vern, you like anything
as long as she's breathing.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.003
Where they at?

31:19.055 --> 31:20.945
- Who?
- They meeting us here?

31:20.975 --> 31:22.248
The hell you talking about?

31:22.278 --> 31:25.009
The girls, damn it!

31:25.094 --> 31:26.227
Boys,

31:26.346 --> 31:27.845
meet the twin sisters,

31:27.930 --> 31:29.647
all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio.

31:29.732 --> 31:31.682
Let me introduce...

31:31.718 --> 31:32.772
Daphne

31:32.802 --> 31:34.719
and her equally pretty sister,

31:34.804 --> 31:35.942
Penelope.

31:43.588 --> 31:45.946
Well, hello there, Daphne.

31:49.235 --> 31:50.701
Hyah!

31:50.820 --> 31:53.204
Mexican supply convoy heading this way!

31:53.323 --> 31:54.648
What are they hauling?

31:54.678 --> 31:56.105
Couldn't really tell.

31:56.135 --> 31:57.942
Vittles, maybe. Medicine. Gunpowder.

31:58.027 --> 31:59.810
- Whiskey?
- Well, all right, then.

31:59.862 --> 32:03.331
Let's see how fast we can
get one of them sisters ready.

32:13.941 --> 32:15.962
Tamp it down, Vern.

32:16.527 --> 32:18.762
Little more.

32:22.681 --> 32:25.772
- Yeah!
- Got 'em!

32:28.374 --> 32:30.724
That... that's him!

32:30.843 --> 32:32.176
You hanged him.

32:32.261 --> 32:34.261
Well, where's that
curly-haired bitch he was with?

32:34.347 --> 32:36.347
Took off... while this
snot-nosed miscreant

32:36.399 --> 32:38.182
was shooting up the town.

32:38.317 --> 32:39.850
So you know we're telling the truth.

32:39.936 --> 32:41.439
Don't know no such thing.

32:41.469 --> 32:42.853
You two could be part of the gang.

32:42.939 --> 32:44.772
Well, where's the silver
wrist cuff he was wearing?

32:44.857 --> 32:47.024
Wearing what he got on.

32:47.109 --> 32:49.994
Did you question him?

32:50.079 --> 32:54.061
I don't believe in a lot of blabber
between catchin' and hangin'.

32:54.091 --> 32:58.090
For a lawman, you possess a
bewildering sense of due process.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.788
I make no apologies for frontier justice,

33:00.873 --> 33:04.103
if that's how I'm gonna
keep my town in order.

33:04.133 --> 33:05.259
Ghost town?

33:05.378 --> 33:07.261
Oh, they'll be back.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.713
Soon as Santa Anna whups Sam Houston's ass

33:09.849 --> 33:12.257
and squashes this senseless revolt.

33:13.219 --> 33:15.975
You support Santa Anna?

33:17.658 --> 33:19.306
That explains your idea of law and order.

33:19.392 --> 33:21.739
You gonna hang us too?

33:22.278 --> 33:24.895
Not till you confess.

33:24.981 --> 33:28.955
We did nothing wrong. We
ain't confessing to anything.

33:29.255 --> 33:31.061
We'll see about that.

33:40.650 --> 33:43.213
Whoo! We're drinking tonight!

33:45.084 --> 33:47.918
Got a special delivery
from Santa Anna hisself!

33:52.008 --> 33:53.807
Yeah, we got a case of Mezcal...

33:55.511 --> 33:57.344
Yeah, come get your provision right here.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.930
We got powder. We got shot.

34:00.066 --> 34:01.765
- Yes, indeed.
- Whoo-hoo!

34:01.817 --> 34:03.770
What do you need? We got it.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.737
Compliments of the Mexican army.

34:06.822 --> 34:07.905
Come here, boys!

34:07.990 --> 34:09.657
Ho to the
master-at-arms!

34:09.742 --> 34:10.991
Your new weapons, gentlemen.

34:13.329 --> 34:14.995
Compliments of the Mexican army.

34:15.114 --> 34:16.746
This ought to make you smile, boys.

34:16.782 --> 34:17.947
Is there any molasses?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.032
I reckon you boys can use
these on the front line.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.254
Yeah, we got us a piece of ordnance here!

34:24.340 --> 34:26.672
This is gonna turn the tide.

34:26.702 --> 34:28.539
Papa!

34:32.098 --> 34:33.964
You have me engage Santa Anna's army

34:34.100 --> 34:36.245
with almost no chance of victory.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.514
No, Sam.

34:37.545 --> 34:39.770
I regard you too highly.

34:39.855 --> 34:41.717
But they would.

34:42.257 --> 34:44.091
Boy came into my tent.

34:44.126 --> 34:47.349
Given the circumstances, he didn't
recognize the commanding officer

34:47.379 --> 34:50.315
and ordered me to repair this.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.967
My point being,

34:55.054 --> 34:58.204
despite his blunder, he
came to the right place.

34:58.234 --> 35:01.558
His faith, regardless that
it was initially misplaced,

35:01.644 --> 35:04.311
will be rewarded nonetheless.

35:04.396 --> 35:06.734
I ask for your trust, Tom.

35:06.764 --> 35:09.091
That young boy gave it to me.

35:09.952 --> 35:11.568
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

35:11.654 --> 35:15.481
Uh, what are your orders, sir?

35:18.981 --> 35:21.078
Ask him.

35:21.163 --> 35:24.164
He's your general.

35:24.216 --> 35:25.382
Deaf,

35:25.501 --> 35:27.084
I need to send some Rangers out tonight...

35:27.169 --> 35:29.386
three of your best riders.

35:29.505 --> 35:31.477
- Colonel Baker, Colonel Sherman.
- Yes, sir.

35:31.507 --> 35:34.169
I hereby order you to serve
in rear guard capacity.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.392
Sam, that's a very bad idea.

35:35.511 --> 35:37.837
You're most likely gonna engage Santa Anna.

35:37.867 --> 35:40.255
Most likely I will, sir.

35:40.933 --> 35:42.349
Pass it along!

35:42.484 --> 35:44.268
Tomorrow, we march!

35:46.856 --> 35:49.022
Get a good rest tonight, men.

35:49.108 --> 35:52.442
Prepare to face your enemy
on the field of battle.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.646
Santa Anna's gonna bleed!

36:08.595 --> 36:10.344
Lord,

36:10.379 --> 36:12.991
I come to you alone...

36:13.021 --> 36:15.048
weak,

36:15.100 --> 36:17.418
sick at heart,

36:17.448 --> 36:19.469
and awful stained.

36:21.397 --> 36:26.026
Why... why you put me
in this time and place

36:26.111 --> 36:28.717
when so many suffer?

36:29.365 --> 36:32.366
As a child, we had bad eating...

36:32.451 --> 36:37.413
stale bread and rotten meat
fed to us in troughs like hogs.

36:38.374 --> 36:40.579
Rough, smelly men...

36:40.609 --> 36:42.275
they came to me in the dead of night

36:42.361 --> 36:45.551
when I still slept with rag dolls.

36:46.495 --> 36:50.250
You made those men covet me.

36:50.285 --> 36:53.025
Made me beautiful.

36:53.055 --> 36:55.188
That's a curse.

36:55.307 --> 36:57.357
A plain black woman lives by her labors,

36:57.443 --> 36:59.893
has some kind of home.

36:59.979 --> 37:02.612
A husband and children who love her.

37:02.698 --> 37:06.033
Help her endure.

37:06.447 --> 37:08.151
This beauty...

37:08.237 --> 37:10.120
it bring me plenty of men,

37:10.205 --> 37:13.629
but not one who loves me.

37:14.221 --> 37:19.129
Not one who walks beside me in this world.

37:19.214 --> 37:21.682
Learning me to read and
write's supposed to lift me up,

37:21.712 --> 37:23.973
make me better.

37:24.003 --> 37:26.330
Tain't so.

37:29.381 --> 37:32.056
My heart grows so cold.

37:32.086 --> 37:34.394
I don't feel nothing.

37:34.713 --> 37:38.348
I'm burning alive in
the fire of my own rage.

37:39.807 --> 37:42.469
I don't live.

37:42.554 --> 37:44.285
I survive.

37:44.315 --> 37:46.397
I exist.

37:49.990 --> 37:52.529
But if my brother Jupiter

37:52.614 --> 37:55.565
loved Texas enough to die for it,

37:55.951 --> 38:00.003
least I can do is my part to liberate it.

38:00.033 --> 38:03.240
No matter what it costs me.

38:03.325 --> 38:06.243
On earth and in heaven.

38:09.131 --> 38:12.799
I have become what you made me.

38:12.884 --> 38:16.386
I do not ask for forgiveness.

38:16.471 --> 38:19.089
The worst I must do

38:19.119 --> 38:21.317
lies yet ahead.

38:22.311 --> 38:25.679
In the good book, you
say there's a time to heal

38:25.764 --> 38:28.565
and a time to kill.

38:28.650 --> 38:31.818
I know which time it is for me.

38:31.937 --> 38:35.397
I'm asking you for the
strength to see it through.

38:36.325 --> 38:39.704
You owe me at least that much.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.407
Judge me as you will.

38:45.117 --> 38:46.499
Amen.

39:00.182 --> 39:01.348
Beautiful.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.924
Did you enjoy the cockfight?

39:04.603 --> 39:06.803
I won.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.132
I always win.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.627
Well, I can always tell a champion cock

39:12.657 --> 39:15.237
just by the look in its eye.

39:17.064 --> 39:18.448
Really?

39:18.533 --> 39:20.283
Uh-huh.

39:23.594 --> 39:27.540
Through the eyes, one
sees into the heart...

39:27.659 --> 39:31.885
be it beast or human.

39:36.585 --> 39:41.221
That man is fiercely devoted to you.

39:41.306 --> 39:43.854
Why's he so jealous of me?

39:47.679 --> 39:50.577
He was taken by Comanches.

39:51.316 --> 39:54.351
The squaws took off his tongue

39:54.436 --> 39:57.689
and sexual organ.

40:00.062 --> 40:01.524
He...

40:01.894 --> 40:03.464
he's never liked women

40:03.494 --> 40:05.484
since.

40:18.657 --> 40:22.514
Well, then he certainly won't like this.

42:09.125 --> 42:11.042
Here, Papa.

42:11.127 --> 42:13.486
Thank you, boy.

42:24.445 --> 42:26.343
Nate.

42:30.182 --> 42:32.386
Go on, boy. Drink it up.

42:39.038 --> 42:40.655
Who wants to plant some corn?

42:40.790 --> 42:42.957
And peas and taters?

42:43.042 --> 42:44.075
And squash and carrots!

42:44.160 --> 42:45.793
And tomatoes and butter beans!

42:45.828 --> 42:48.129
Whatever you want.

42:48.214 --> 42:50.353
Nate, I think I'll finish up here.

42:50.790 --> 42:52.572
You go on to town.

42:52.602 --> 42:54.200
You fetch that empresario, Buckley,

42:54.230 --> 42:55.820
and tell him we want
some seeds and supplies,

42:55.855 --> 42:58.606
and you tell him to put it on account.

42:58.691 --> 43:00.255
Yes, sir. Right quick.

43:00.285 --> 43:02.947
I want to be planting by morning.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.421
All right, children, back to your chores.

43:08.451 --> 43:10.740
Yes, Mama.

43:27.336 --> 43:30.054
Drinks on El presidente Santy Annie!

43:38.231 --> 43:39.930
- To Texas, gentlemen.
- To Texas.

43:39.982 --> 43:42.900
Gentlemen, to Texas and to victory.

43:45.354 --> 43:46.604
Hee hee!

44:26.658 --> 44:28.587
Yee-haw!

44:42.879 --> 44:45.329
Care to partake?

44:45.414 --> 44:48.382
My pa would surely forbid it.

44:50.136 --> 44:52.680
Well, I ain't asking your pa.

44:53.923 --> 44:56.724
I guess you're old enough
to make your own decisions.

44:57.614 --> 44:59.604
Or ain't you?

45:03.983 --> 45:06.512
I've had a nip before, you know.

45:06.542 --> 45:09.236
Oh, I'm sure you have.

45:28.758 --> 45:30.205
Sarah?

45:30.235 --> 45:32.259
- Oh, no. It's my pa.
- Sarah!

45:32.378 --> 45:35.212
I'd like a word with my daughter.

45:35.298 --> 45:38.390
You ought to get on
back to the festivities.

45:38.885 --> 45:40.756
Go on.

45:42.638 --> 45:44.704
Come on along with me.

45:45.942 --> 45:49.001
Or are you gonna stay here with him?

45:58.830 --> 46:00.788
I thought I told you

46:00.873 --> 46:05.743
to steer clear of that
no-account scalawag.

46:05.878 --> 46:08.078
Look, I see you talking to him again,

46:08.214 --> 46:10.581
I swear, I'll make you wish you hadn't.

46:10.666 --> 46:13.050
You understand?

46:13.392 --> 46:15.975
Is that why my mama ran off
with that whiskey peddler?

46:16.362 --> 46:17.393
Why you little...

46:20.952 --> 46:22.342
Sarah...

46:22.428 --> 46:24.739
Sarah, please!

46:27.650 --> 46:29.576
Please.

47:29.912 --> 47:32.079
All that thunder and racket...

47:32.164 --> 47:34.380
not a drop of rain.

47:36.969 --> 47:39.803
Hell, Sam.

47:39.889 --> 47:42.422
Ain't really sure if I should report you

47:42.508 --> 47:45.200
or run like hell.

47:47.884 --> 47:50.397
It's not a rain dance.

47:51.068 --> 47:55.831
It's more of a combination
war chant, purification ritual.

47:55.861 --> 47:57.614
Cleansing my spirit.

47:57.644 --> 47:59.848
Get my mind set.

48:01.798 --> 48:04.369
That doing anything for you?

48:07.499 --> 48:08.949
Not much.

48:21.263 --> 48:24.313
Couple of my scouts came back.

48:25.434 --> 48:28.340
Santa Anna's splitting up his army.

48:29.664 --> 48:32.940
Just like your spy gal said.

48:35.978 --> 48:37.778
Deaf, you ever miss something

48:37.863 --> 48:41.048
you never had and know you never will?

48:42.618 --> 48:45.449
Doesn't stop you from missing them.

48:46.989 --> 48:48.594
You could have knocked
me over with a feather

48:48.624 --> 48:51.183
when I saw Emily again.

48:52.661 --> 48:54.828
Now she's, well...

48:59.530 --> 49:02.283
I'll tell you this,

49:02.313 --> 49:05.081
the most precious moment

49:05.111 --> 49:06.340
that ever come in this world

49:06.392 --> 49:10.094
is when a woman loves a man just as he is.

49:12.777 --> 49:15.256
That's it in a nutshell.

49:21.705 --> 49:24.647
Good thing about talking to you, Deaf...

49:24.677 --> 49:27.494
I can tell you anything.

50:29.447 --> 50:31.804
Hmm.

51:50.252 --> 51:51.344
Papa?

51:51.430 --> 51:52.762
Shh! Get... get in the bedroom.

51:52.848 --> 51:54.784
- Go on. Go on.
- Go. Go to bed.

51:59.743 --> 52:01.739
Don't be standing behind me, woman.

52:01.769 --> 52:04.309
Get to bed and lock the door.

52:19.202 --> 52:21.775
Get the guns. Get in the cellar!

53:01.620 --> 53:03.243
I got you. I got you.

53:21.219 --> 53:23.553
Papa?

53:23.588 --> 53:25.421
I got you, I got you. It's all right.

53:25.507 --> 53:27.670
You're all right.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.013
Hang on.

53:34.099 --> 53:35.481
Hold on.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.800
Stay over there!

53:39.830 --> 53:41.771
Stay over next to your brother, now!

53:41.856 --> 53:43.546
All right. I want you to push this on you.

53:43.576 --> 53:44.780
I want you to push this on you now.

53:44.810 --> 53:47.603
Buck?

53:47.633 --> 53:49.279
I got to close that.

53:49.414 --> 53:50.496
Kids!

53:50.615 --> 53:52.987
Kids, get back here!

53:53.418 --> 53:55.473
Get back here!

53:55.503 --> 53:56.949
Bucky!

53:58.585 --> 53:59.792
Bucky!

54:01.789 --> 54:03.901
Lucas!

54:06.598 --> 54:09.059
Okay. Come on!

54:12.938 --> 54:14.993
Look out!

54:15.319 --> 54:17.023
Go!

55:30.861 --> 55:33.310
Miss Pauline.

56:15.638 --> 56:18.228
Gator, you ever take a bank before?

56:18.258 --> 56:21.170
Is a bullfrog's ass watertight?

56:21.200 --> 56:25.096
Louisiana Canal Bank, '32.

56:25.421 --> 56:27.187
That was me and the LaMelle brothers.

56:27.217 --> 56:28.778
The LaMelle brothers?

56:28.808 --> 56:29.982
Yeah.

56:30.012 --> 56:31.583
I was upriver in the pokey

56:31.613 --> 56:34.355
with the LaMelle brothers in '32.

56:34.680 --> 56:36.023
Oh.

56:36.326 --> 56:39.727
Maybe it was '31.

56:40.148 --> 56:41.985
Bullshit.

56:54.781 --> 56:57.461
This here's what you call irony.

56:57.897 --> 57:01.582
Swear, Hardcase, you just plain bad luck.

57:01.991 --> 57:04.335
Me?

57:04.420 --> 57:07.355
Since I met you, I've been bushwhacked,

57:07.385 --> 57:09.916
robbed, almost killed,

57:09.946 --> 57:12.365
and now about to hang.

57:18.434 --> 57:19.963
That's mighty kind of you, ma'am.

57:19.993 --> 57:21.402
Thank you.

57:21.487 --> 57:23.604
Did you do what the empresario said?

57:23.690 --> 57:25.239
No, ma'am. He's railroading us.

57:26.126 --> 57:27.320
I believe it.

57:27.350 --> 57:30.244
My husband, Erastus, he's
with the rangering company.

57:30.330 --> 57:31.946
Deaf Smith, capitan.

57:32.031 --> 57:35.649
No mollycoddling the prisoners!

57:39.622 --> 57:41.622
Giving you one more day.

57:41.758 --> 57:44.041
If you're still reluctant
to admit your guilt,

57:44.127 --> 57:48.191
I'm gonna have to let Clarence
offer some encouragement.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.053
Clarence is an artist.

57:56.359 --> 57:57.588
Mister,

57:57.674 --> 57:59.062
he smacks me with that whip,

57:59.092 --> 58:01.193
he best not stop till I'm dead.

58:01.223 --> 58:02.426
Fair enough,

58:02.456 --> 58:06.013
although a legal hanging
would be much more civilized.

58:06.099 --> 58:08.666
One more day, gentlemen.

58:16.924 --> 58:18.609
Tell General Gaines to be prepared

58:18.695 --> 58:22.413
in the event that Mexicans
venture into the neutral zone.

58:22.498 --> 58:23.948
Sir, they're camped out by the border,

58:24.033 --> 58:25.366
but I'm not aware of any Mexicans

58:25.451 --> 58:26.951
active in the neutral zone.

58:27.036 --> 58:28.591
Well, go out there and find them, son.

58:28.621 --> 58:31.088
They're out there, I promise.

58:31.124 --> 58:33.062
Mr. President, what if,
in following the orders,

58:33.092 --> 58:35.259
General Gaines runs into the Mexican army?

58:35.345 --> 58:39.597
Well, that'd be the luckiest
day in Sam Houston's life.

58:39.682 --> 58:41.679
Should Santa Anna follow General Houston

58:41.709 --> 58:44.218
across the border and into the States,

58:44.304 --> 58:45.976
we could certainly defend ourselves

58:46.006 --> 58:49.974
and give that arrogant peacock
the beating he deserves.

59:11.637 --> 59:14.248
- Help!
- Hey, help! Somebody help!

59:14.334 --> 59:15.499
Come on!

59:15.585 --> 59:17.251
She's bleeding. Let's go!

59:17.337 --> 59:20.282
Come on! She's bleeding!

59:22.842 --> 59:24.874
What happened, boy?

59:26.763 --> 59:28.884
Comanche.

59:29.802 --> 59:32.516
Comanches.

59:33.169 --> 59:35.404
Comanches.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.189
Rapido! Agua!

59:38.324 --> 59:41.247
Una palangana. Ayudame.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.475
This road'll take you back up

59:52.505 --> 59:54.538
to the Trinity and Nacogdoches.

59:54.590 --> 59:57.552
Road here, Harrisburg,
straight as a compass.

59:58.544 --> 01:00:00.511
Very well.

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:02.213
Gentlemen,

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:04.285
this way lies the Sabine River

01:00:04.315 --> 01:00:06.767
and the safety of the United States.

01:00:06.886 --> 01:00:12.017
That way... Santa Anna
and the Mexican army.

01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:15.177
Which way, men?

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.195
What do you remember?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.649
Remember the Alamo!

01:00:21.679 --> 01:00:24.568
Remember the Alamo!

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.247
You let them decide, huh?

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:39.216
A man'll fight harder if he
thinks the decision is his own.

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:42.970
Besides,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.909
they know which way.

01:02:24.759 --> 01:02:28.893
I am stuck in this Texas shithole.

01:02:30.131 --> 01:02:33.655
Swatting mosquitoes.

01:02:33.685 --> 01:02:36.352
Chasing rats.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.269
These Texas rebels

01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:42.942
are too stupid to know they've lost.

01:02:45.544 --> 01:02:46.996
I'm tired of this war.

01:02:47.082 --> 01:02:49.557
I am going to end it.

01:02:50.255 --> 01:02:51.751
Excellency,

01:02:51.836 --> 01:02:54.854
our scout report that Houston has
turned around and coming this way.

01:02:54.884 --> 01:02:55.922
Uh-huh.

01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:57.795
The plains of San Jacinto.

01:02:57.825 --> 01:02:59.942
They've apparently halted their retreat.

01:03:00.028 --> 01:03:01.110
Perfect.

01:03:01.196 --> 01:03:02.612
Bait the trap;

01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:05.198
eventually, the rat stumbles into it.

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.700
Honor and glory are upon us.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:09.502
Call up our dispatch riders

01:03:09.587 --> 01:03:12.922
and send for our generales.

01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:15.591
This is our moment.

01:03:41.891 --> 01:03:45.901
Gentlemen, God delays, but he doesn't deny.

01:03:46.308 --> 01:03:50.343
I believe He's given us our battlements.

01:03:50.428 --> 01:03:53.936
Cavalry cannot operate in such thick woods.

01:03:53.966 --> 01:03:56.349
Can't flank us through the marsh.

01:03:56.484 --> 01:04:00.069
There's just the field between us and them.

01:04:00.188 --> 01:04:02.484
If they decide to cross it,

01:04:02.514 --> 01:04:04.310
we'll pour fire from these woods

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.409
and cut them to shreds.

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:08.771
Make camp in the woods by company.

01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:11.005
Spread the word.

01:04:14.369 --> 01:04:16.034
Make camp by company!

01:04:16.064 --> 01:04:17.421
In the woods!

01:04:17.451 --> 01:04:19.169
Spread the word!

01:04:24.842 --> 01:04:27.297
Fortify your position.

01:04:27.382 --> 01:04:30.219
Houston is exactly where we want him.

01:04:31.353 --> 01:04:34.187
Erect every tent we have in plain sight.

01:04:34.272 --> 01:04:36.103
Build fires in front of each one.

01:04:36.133 --> 01:04:38.195
Make sure they burn all night.

01:04:38.225 --> 01:04:41.389
The rebels must not know
we're not yet at full force.

01:04:41.419 --> 01:04:42.795
Build barricades there.

01:04:42.847 --> 01:04:44.714
Grab brush, everything we can find

01:04:44.799 --> 01:04:48.640
to protect the camp from a frontal assault.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:51.871
Position artillery there.

01:04:51.923 --> 01:04:54.123
Go down; stand out on the hill.

01:04:56.453 --> 01:04:59.147
I want scouts in the field now!

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:02.417
Pull those wagons.

01:05:03.268 --> 01:05:05.801
I want everything ready before sunset.

01:05:13.027 --> 01:05:15.478
- Position the cannons here.
- Right away, sir!

01:05:17.732 --> 01:05:19.732
I want sentries posted there,

01:05:19.867 --> 01:05:21.951
there, on that rise over yonder,

01:05:22.036 --> 01:05:23.619
and directly across the river.

01:05:23.738 --> 01:05:25.610
Tell them not to engage.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.641
Rangering company's to
reconnoiter Santa Anna's army.

01:05:28.726 --> 01:05:30.393
Scout the proximity of
any advancing troops.

01:05:30.478 --> 01:05:31.611
Yes, sir. Hyah!

01:05:31.696 --> 01:05:34.805
Sentries here, there, and yonder.

01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:46.174
Hurry!

01:05:57.639 --> 01:05:59.735
My brave men...

01:06:05.857 --> 01:06:08.848
Soldiers of freedom.

01:06:09.214 --> 01:06:12.018
I know you are tired.

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:15.221
But by your heroic toil,

01:06:15.273 --> 01:06:18.774
you save the life of the man next to you.

01:06:18.893 --> 01:06:22.311
If we are all willing
to die for each other...

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.066
We will all live to see our homes again.

01:06:27.201 --> 01:06:29.118
Viva Mexico!

01:06:29.203 --> 01:06:31.871
Viva!

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:34.361
De vuelta al trabajo!

01:06:38.246 --> 01:06:41.213
Once the defenses are
in place, I'll attack.

01:06:41.249 --> 01:06:43.749
What about reinforcements, your Excellency?

01:06:43.779 --> 01:06:46.588
The rest of our army's on their way.

01:06:51.259 --> 01:06:53.843
These appear to be defensive dispositions.

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:56.812
Houston can't still intend to delay.

01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:59.648
If you believe in the
power of aggressive tactics,

01:06:59.734 --> 01:07:02.167
you got the wrong general.

01:07:03.571 --> 01:07:06.822
Men, get a good rest and a meal in you.

01:07:06.852 --> 01:07:09.608
One fire per unit, without exception,

01:07:09.694 --> 01:07:12.372
doused at sundown.

01:07:12.402 --> 01:07:15.998
I want all weapons
serviceable and ready to fire.

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:18.834
Blades honed razor-sharp.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.922
Fresh powder and ball for every rifle.

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:24.454
In addition to cannonballs,

01:07:24.484 --> 01:07:26.876
chop up horseshoes, wire,

01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:31.152
and any scrap metal on
hand to feed the sisters.

01:07:31.182 --> 01:07:33.508
Let's let 'em know we're here!

01:07:33.538 --> 01:07:36.089
Yes, sir!

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.303
That is all.

01:07:45.508 --> 01:07:47.420
Ah... shh, shh.

01:07:51.216 --> 01:07:53.235
Dreams.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.574
I'm sorry.

01:08:09.637 --> 01:08:12.838
I... I... I'll talk to
him. I'll talk to him.

01:08:12.974 --> 01:08:15.964
- Make sure we got enough water.
- Is it true?

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.805
They brought him in here.

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:27.419
With the Comanches running wild,

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:30.939
we're gonna need a couple extra gunhands.

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:32.691
Then you better go find some.

01:08:32.777 --> 01:08:34.577
We ain't doing shit for you.

01:08:34.607 --> 01:08:35.966
Not me you need to help;

01:08:35.997 --> 01:08:38.407
it's the good people of this town.

01:08:39.831 --> 01:08:42.813
Besides, I've been
reevaluating the evidence.

01:08:42.843 --> 01:08:45.120
Evidence?

01:08:45.531 --> 01:08:48.122
Few things I confiscated
from those young brigands.

01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:49.313
My wrist cuff?

01:08:49.343 --> 01:08:53.127
Uh, no, but let's see...

01:08:53.214 --> 01:08:55.798
There's a rifle and a scabbard;

01:08:55.883 --> 01:08:59.435
saddle bags with some kind of
initial... might have been an H.

01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:01.518
Oh... oh, yeah, big brown stallion

01:09:01.548 --> 01:09:03.881
and what looks like a fine
Tennessee thoroughbred.

01:09:03.912 --> 01:09:06.142
- Our horses.
- You help us get through this,

01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:08.363
I might recollect where I stabled them.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:10.410
- Why, you low-down...
- You son of a bitch.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:13.148
Would have preferred hanging
you and keeping the horses,

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:16.225
but now, well,

01:09:16.255 --> 01:09:18.857
necessity requires your help.

01:09:32.883 --> 01:09:34.854
- Take him alive.
- Come on!

01:09:34.885 --> 01:09:36.731
I got him.

01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:48.263
Son, what you got in that pouch?

01:10:07.038 --> 01:10:09.706
Well, this is getting mighty old.

01:10:09.736 --> 01:10:13.772
Elwood, you had best set
your mind to hold this ground,

01:10:13.802 --> 01:10:16.825
or we will all be buried beneath it.

01:10:29.256 --> 01:10:30.922
Let's see.

01:10:31.007 --> 01:10:33.413
Swamp in front of us.

01:10:33.443 --> 01:10:36.283
Wall of pine behind us.

01:10:36.313 --> 01:10:38.208
Black flag.

01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:40.305
Devil music.

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:43.014
Whole mess of Mexicans.

01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:46.902
That sound familiar to any of y'all?

01:10:47.992 --> 01:10:49.824
You mean the Alamo?

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:53.376
Oh! Looks like someone
just lit Knowles' lantern.

01:10:53.406 --> 01:10:56.298
Here.

01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:58.383
Houston's a damn idiot, I've told y'all.

01:10:58.418 --> 01:11:00.544
- It's a lost cause.
- Shut it, Vern.

01:11:00.574 --> 01:11:03.159
I've had enough of your
whining, your gum-flapping.

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:06.861
You shut me up, then, you octoroon zambo.

01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:09.676
Ain't a white man. Ain't a red man.

01:11:09.706 --> 01:11:11.758
What is you, then?

01:11:12.074 --> 01:11:14.064
I'll show you what I am.

01:11:15.652 --> 01:11:17.607
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:11:17.637 --> 01:11:18.770
- Break it up!
- All right. All right.

01:11:18.855 --> 01:11:20.481
- Get up. Get off him!
- Come on, man.

01:11:20.511 --> 01:11:21.973
- Come on, that's enough!
- Get off him!

01:11:22.109 --> 01:11:23.942
- Said that's enough, Vern.
- Acting like animals.

01:11:23.977 --> 01:11:25.477
- Get up!
- Get off me!

01:11:25.512 --> 01:11:27.796
Pull them horns in 'fore
you kill each other.

01:11:27.881 --> 01:11:29.714
Settle down!

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.467
Now, I'm trying to put
together a nice meal.

01:11:32.552 --> 01:11:35.854
Go get us some biscuits and molasses.

01:11:35.939 --> 01:11:38.856
Ain't nobody ought to
die on an empty stomach.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.362
What do you know? Anderson ain't perfect.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.567
Never seen no Injun fall off a horse.

01:11:53.153 --> 01:11:55.235
Rebecca.

01:11:59.162 --> 01:12:02.055
Now, don't tell nobody.

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:04.274
Santa Anna's got us trapped.

01:12:04.304 --> 01:12:06.451
You and Sarah need to find a safe place.

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:07.735
You know what he does to prisoners.

01:12:07.871 --> 01:12:10.154
Whatever happens to you happens to me.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.574
I'm not going anywhere.

01:12:12.659 --> 01:12:15.398
Shoot, come here.

01:12:15.912 --> 01:12:18.885
- What are you hiding back there?
- It's nothing.

01:12:18.915 --> 01:12:20.087
Come on, what are you hiding back there?

01:12:20.117 --> 01:12:21.188
- It's nothing.
- Come on!

01:12:21.218 --> 01:12:22.750
What are you hiding? Come on.

01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:24.057
- Come on.
- It's nothing.

01:12:24.087 --> 01:12:26.337
- Give it. Come on.
- It's nothing.

01:12:28.327 --> 01:12:30.684
Did you write me something?

01:12:50.337 --> 01:12:52.634
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:52.664 --> 01:12:55.128
'Cause I didn't want it to be true.

01:12:56.183 --> 01:12:59.225
Should've known I ain't that lucky.

01:12:59.255 --> 01:13:01.971
So where's your fiancé now?

01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:05.771
Gavin's up north setting up our homestead.

01:13:08.214 --> 01:13:10.754
Best go be with your man.

01:13:10.784 --> 01:13:12.166
Like I said,

01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:14.354
it ain't safe here.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.403
What do you need this for?

01:13:48.738 --> 01:13:50.560
- So you can shoot me with it?
- No.

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:52.090
It's for protection, Antonio.

01:13:52.175 --> 01:13:53.508
Protection?

01:14:01.165 --> 01:14:04.145
You want to kill me? Huh?

01:14:06.072 --> 01:14:08.990
- That's what you want?
- Antonio!

01:14:33.627 --> 01:14:35.923
Keep her under guard.

01:14:40.382 --> 01:14:44.063
You men... place that barricade
down next to the other one.

01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:45.142
Fill up that gap.

01:14:45.261 --> 01:14:46.427
You heard the general. Move!

01:14:46.512 --> 01:14:48.346
Caught Santa Anna's dispatch rider.

01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:49.647
Sientate.

01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:51.682
Says here...

01:14:51.768 --> 01:14:53.901
are en route to join him.

01:14:53.987 --> 01:14:55.186
Cos' troops...

01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:57.855
only hours away.

01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:00.942
I told you... squandering our opportunity.

01:15:06.916 --> 01:15:08.833
That's just for show.

01:15:08.918 --> 01:15:10.868
To let us know he's here.

01:15:12.773 --> 01:15:14.121
The prisoner! Stop him!

01:15:14.257 --> 01:15:15.923
Damn it, get those.

01:15:15.959 --> 01:15:17.174
Steady on!

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.342
It's not an attack!

01:15:18.372 --> 01:15:19.595
What the hell?

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:21.012
Nobody said shoot him.

01:15:21.097 --> 01:15:22.847
He was at the Alamo.

01:15:22.877 --> 01:15:24.928
And how do you figure that?

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.346
It was Colonel Travis' saddlebags.

01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:34.225
Adjust two degrees left.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:37.575
Give them more to worry about.

01:15:38.948 --> 01:15:41.983
Make sure they get no sleep tonight.

01:15:42.068 --> 01:15:43.950
Fire!

01:15:45.321 --> 01:15:47.447
Fire those cannons back!

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:49.123
Fire those cannons back!

01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:50.875
Not yet!

01:15:52.829 --> 01:15:55.533
Let's answer his Excellency's greeting.

01:15:55.563 --> 01:15:57.920
Fire on my command!

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:00.334
Fire one!

01:16:00.796 --> 01:16:03.276
Fire two!

01:16:09.846 --> 01:16:11.012
Excellent.

01:16:11.064 --> 01:16:13.064
Now we know

01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:15.683
they have at least two 6-pounders.

01:16:15.768 --> 01:16:18.647
And officers who know how to fire them.

01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:21.828
Cease fire.

01:16:33.601 --> 01:16:35.057
He's done.

01:16:35.087 --> 01:16:36.912
Made his point.

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:43.010
All right, let's get it.

01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:50.006
What's gnawing at you, Sam?

01:16:50.036 --> 01:16:51.876
This.

01:16:51.906 --> 01:16:54.489
I want you to take Karnes and
ride out to Vince's Bridge.

01:16:54.519 --> 01:16:57.898
Let me know if Santa Anna gets reinforced.

01:17:02.098 --> 01:17:04.548
I believe they are about
to attack, your Excellency.

01:17:04.634 --> 01:17:06.100
They won't attack.

01:17:06.219 --> 01:17:08.018
But prepare as if they will.

01:17:08.104 --> 01:17:09.308
Yes, sir.

01:17:09.338 --> 01:17:11.505
Send a squad of cavalry

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:13.207
just to test them.

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:15.113
Yes, sir.

01:17:31.637 --> 01:17:33.470
General.

01:17:33.506 --> 01:17:36.807
I understand you're a better
military strategist than I.

01:17:36.892 --> 01:17:39.415
But before we're outnumbered,

01:17:39.445 --> 01:17:42.029
why don't we attack?

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:45.833
'Cause I'm not ordering one.

01:17:45.863 --> 01:17:48.119
You may reconnoiter with
your cavalry after sundown,

01:17:48.204 --> 01:17:50.626
but under no circumstances
are you to engage.

01:17:50.656 --> 01:17:53.657
Is that clear?

01:17:53.793 --> 01:17:56.393
Tom, why don't you ride along with him?

01:17:58.863 --> 01:18:00.581
Check.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:11.772
Almonte, dispatch.

01:18:12.028 --> 01:18:13.900
Find out where General Cos is.

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.012
Right away, sir.

01:18:15.098 --> 01:18:17.381
Dispatch.

01:18:17.467 --> 01:18:19.850
Everybody in position.

01:18:20.576 --> 01:18:22.403
You heard his Excellency.

01:18:22.433 --> 01:18:25.525
Find General Cos.

01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:32.518
Kill me or let me go.

01:18:34.554 --> 01:18:35.771
Yes, sir.

01:18:35.801 --> 01:18:38.875
I done deserve a whuppin'.

01:18:38.905 --> 01:18:42.509
But none of my previous
masters used their fists.

01:18:42.539 --> 01:18:45.846
They all had the decency to use the whip.

01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:51.805
If I was gonna kill you, I
had many opportunities to.

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:09.675
You know the only time a
bull survives in the ring...

01:19:11.604 --> 01:19:15.859
is when he has been extremely brave.

01:19:18.194 --> 01:19:22.732
You are extremely brave.

01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:37.461
You're free...

01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:39.463
to go.

01:19:39.845 --> 01:19:42.079
To join me in my tent.

01:19:43.104 --> 01:19:44.769
You choose.

01:19:44.804 --> 01:19:47.159
Me or Houston.

01:19:58.067 --> 01:19:59.150
Can't stop now, sir.

01:19:59.285 --> 01:20:00.484
Let's go!

01:20:02.405 --> 01:20:03.988
Charge!

01:20:04.073 --> 01:20:05.322
Come on!

01:20:05.408 --> 01:20:06.824
Fire!

01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:09.362
General, Sherman's attacking.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:12.313
God damn Sherman.

01:20:12.343 --> 01:20:14.732
The bastard's gonna cost us the war.

01:20:14.762 --> 01:20:16.050
I ordered him not to engage.

01:20:23.142 --> 01:20:24.896
Hyah!

01:20:26.896 --> 01:20:28.661
Buffoons.

01:20:33.236 --> 01:20:35.366
Regroup!

01:20:37.655 --> 01:20:39.412
Fall back!

01:20:39.824 --> 01:20:41.661
Fall back!

01:20:43.773 --> 01:20:45.689
Stay back!

01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:47.739
Halt! Stay in the trees!

01:20:48.934 --> 01:20:50.100
Form ranks!

01:20:50.185 --> 01:20:51.435
Cover their retreat!

01:20:51.465 --> 01:20:52.603
Back to the tree line!

01:20:52.738 --> 01:20:54.488
Take cover! You heard him!

01:21:00.274 --> 01:21:02.823
Fall back! Sherman, look out.

01:21:03.921 --> 01:21:07.251
Sidney, get on a horse, you ass!

01:21:07.336 --> 01:21:10.621
Get the colonel on a horse and fall back!

01:21:14.177 --> 01:21:16.343
- Help!
- Colby!

01:21:16.373 --> 01:21:18.128
- Help!
- Damn it.

01:21:18.158 --> 01:21:19.965
Hyah!

01:21:21.287 --> 01:21:23.185
Get back. Get back!

01:21:25.585 --> 01:21:26.887
Help me!

01:21:26.917 --> 01:21:29.787
- General...
- Come on.

01:21:31.503 --> 01:21:33.646
Hyah!

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:36.982
Fall back!

01:22:06.732 --> 01:22:09.365
I am waiting.

01:22:11.202 --> 01:22:13.100
Hyah!

01:22:17.385 --> 01:22:19.656
Your orders were not to engage.

01:22:19.792 --> 01:22:21.908
Now get out of my sight.

01:22:21.994 --> 01:22:24.768
Would it not be better
to rejoin all our armies

01:22:24.798 --> 01:22:26.630
and then pursue Houston on the offensive?

01:22:26.715 --> 01:22:28.665
Why? We have him!

01:22:28.717 --> 01:22:30.500
General, we take that bridge,

01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:31.885
you won't have to worry about

01:22:32.004 --> 01:22:34.129
Santa Anna's reinforcements no more.

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:36.390
You'd be all by your lonesome.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.507
I know who you are.

01:22:37.593 --> 01:22:39.309
Then you know to leave me be.

01:22:39.395 --> 01:22:41.511
If we blow up the bridge,

01:22:41.597 --> 01:22:43.847
how are we supposed to get back across it?

01:22:43.932 --> 01:22:46.600
We don't.

01:22:46.685 --> 01:22:49.686
This day I'd ally with the devil himself.

01:22:49.772 --> 01:22:52.439
Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.

01:22:52.524 --> 01:22:54.658
I think you just did.

01:22:54.743 --> 01:22:56.693
Round up men for a posse.

01:22:56.779 --> 01:22:58.278
We got a rescue mission.

01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:00.669
There's trouble somewhere. You want men.

01:23:00.699 --> 01:23:02.416
You found Emily West?

01:23:03.752 --> 01:23:06.253
Remember the Alamo!

01:23:06.338 --> 01:23:07.587
Come on!

01:23:09.958 --> 01:23:11.258
Ah!

01:23:11.343 --> 01:23:13.186
They may have cleaned you up.

01:23:13.216 --> 01:23:15.288
I know you.
