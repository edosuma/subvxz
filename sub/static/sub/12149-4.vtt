WEBVTT

00:10.330 --> 00:12.289
Ugh, look at all these bills.

00:12.730 --> 00:14.199
Water and power.

00:14.529 --> 00:17.760
Oh, and my perennial
favorite, the rent.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.039
What am I missing?

00:19.929 --> 00:22.839
- Not a thing that I can see.
- Doyle, try to pay attention.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.140
I am paying attention, princess.

00:25.929 --> 00:28.140
We just need the income
to pay for the outgo.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.140
This is a business.
We need to start running it like one.

00:31.929 --> 00:34.390
We should be charging.
Angel works day and night...

00:34.929 --> 00:36.679
...to help people
fight personal demons...

00:37.329 --> 00:38.520
...but I need a raise.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.320
You've worked for him for 20 minutes.

00:40.929 --> 00:43.140
A month. And I have needs.

00:43.929 --> 00:47.049
- Needs.
- A person needs certain...

00:48.130 --> 00:49.000
...designer...

00:49.329 --> 00:50.450
...things.

00:50.530 --> 00:52.700
I don't think you need much clothes.

00:53.530 --> 00:55.990
But you are right,
Angel needs to start charging.

00:56.530 --> 00:58.950
He just hates bringing up
finances with clients.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.320
He likes playing the hero...

01:01.329 --> 01:04.099
...walking off into the dark,
his long coat flowing behind him...

01:04.930 --> 01:06.930
...in that mysterious
and attractive way.

01:07.329 --> 01:10.349
- Is this a private moment?
- No, I'm not saying I'm attracted.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.890
He just projects
a certain kind of image.

01:13.930 --> 01:17.189
Asking for money isn't part of it.
He's sensitive about that.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.939
Here he comes.
We're gonna stand up to him.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.109
We're standing up.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.930
Just as soon as he's had his coffee.

01:25.329 --> 01:26.200
Right.

01:26.530 --> 01:28.319
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.849
- What is this?
- Last week's coffee.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.579
- Think of it as espresso.
- I think my esophagus is melting.

01:42.129 --> 01:44.620
Sure been making us proud
fighting the evil and all.

01:45.129 --> 01:47.590
You've been fantastic,
saving people left and right--

01:48.129 --> 01:51.319
- I'm not comfortable asking for money.
- Then get over it!

01:51.730 --> 01:53.620
I mean that in a sensitive way.

01:54.129 --> 01:57.040
It's not your favorite thing,
but you gotta do what's right.

01:57.730 --> 02:00.150
It's right to ask people
in trouble for money?

02:00.730 --> 02:01.739
No.

02:01.930 --> 02:03.819
- So we agree?
- No.

02:04.329 --> 02:07.519
- We don't agree?
- Make up your mind, will you? Doyle!

02:08.530 --> 02:10.250
Uh-oh. Vision fit approaching.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.060
Pen. Paper.

02:19.330 --> 02:21.400
- A single malt Scotch.
- Here.

02:23.530 --> 02:24.439
What'd you see?

02:24.729 --> 02:26.900
Melissa Burns,
at Pardell Paper Products.

02:27.729 --> 02:29.310
- How'd she look?
- Melissa Burns.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.719
Better than me.

02:33.729 --> 02:35.620
This ain't single malt. It's...

02:36.129 --> 02:37.000
...polymalt.

02:37.330 --> 02:40.310
Okay, Pardell Paper Products,
200 Wilshire Boulevard.

02:40.930 --> 02:42.439
Guess I'm going to work.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.129 --> 02:52.879
Maybe I'm a little attracted.

03:48.169 --> 03:49.400
I clearly said Penny!

03:51.169 --> 03:53.310
I spelled it with letters.

03:54.169 --> 03:56.659
It's okay, I'll fix it.
Here, you do these.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.259
Aha! Perfect.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.870
- Okay, light them.
- Okay, I'm lighting.

04:03.770 --> 04:04.960
Great.

04:06.770 --> 04:08.659
- What about the "J"?
- What's going on?

04:10.969 --> 04:12.229
Happy birthday!

04:12.770 --> 04:16.139
Oh, this is so sweet.
You've only been here a month...

04:16.970 --> 04:19.810
...and already you know
four of the letters of my name.

04:20.569 --> 04:23.480
Well, it's just we thought
you should be Penjy from now on.

04:24.170 --> 04:25.850
We think it suits you better.

04:25.970 --> 04:28.709
- Make a wish already.
- Okay, all right, wait.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.980
Yeah!

04:33.170 --> 04:36.860
I painted the pot myself,
so feel free to break it by accident.

04:37.370 --> 04:38.769
Don't be silly. Thanks.

04:39.170 --> 04:42.189
Check it out. My little
philodendron just got upstaged.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.470
I don't know anybody
with taste that good.

04:45.769 --> 04:48.160
Oh, right you are.
They're for Melissa.

04:49.370 --> 04:50.769
- Who they from?
- I don't know.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.269
Delivery guy from Ned's Flowers.

04:58.970 --> 05:00.019
Something wrong?

05:01.370 --> 05:02.420
No.

05:03.769 --> 05:05.769
No one ever sends me flowers.

05:07.970 --> 05:10.250
- Would you watch my phones?
- Oh, sure, honey.

05:49.370 --> 05:50.420
Melissa.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.519
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to startle you.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.560
- I thought you were someone else.
- You all right?

05:57.170 --> 05:58.149
Yes.

05:58.370 --> 06:01.600
- I'm Angel. I'm in private security.
- Excuse me?

06:02.569 --> 06:04.149
It's what I do.

06:04.370 --> 06:05.240
It's my job.

06:05.569 --> 06:07.920
You walk around garages
telling people this?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.360
I think you may need my services.

06:15.170 --> 06:18.750
- I can't afford private security.
- It's not about money. I help people.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.860
- Sometimes when the police can't.
- Out of goodness?

06:22.370 --> 06:24.829
- I'm not explaining this very well.
- No, but thanks.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.829
If you need anything,
call that number.

06:30.769 --> 06:31.639
I scared her,

06:31.970 --> 06:33.649
Seems like she was already scared.

06:34.370 --> 06:37.000
Hey, am I intimidating?
I mean, do I put people off?

06:37.370 --> 06:39.509
As vampires go, you're pretty cuddly.

06:40.370 --> 06:43.069
You might think about mixing up
the black-on-black look.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.000
Maybe she'd feel safer talking to you.

06:46.370 --> 06:48.509
When she hires us, I'll get involved.

06:49.370 --> 06:50.240
Cordelia's right.

06:50.569 --> 06:53.620
I don't think so. I got a feeling
we should get involved now.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.100
- This shouldn't be about money.
- It isn't.

06:56.569 --> 06:58.779
Yeah, you should listen to--
It isn't?

06:58.970 --> 07:01.639
It's about doing what's best
for those you've helped.

07:02.569 --> 07:04.600
People get attached
to a mysterious savior...

07:04.970 --> 07:06.160
...and can you blame them?

07:06.769 --> 07:09.790
But as long as you're a man
who's doing a job and getting paid...

07:10.370 --> 07:14.160
...they'll feel like they've paid their
debt and move on, independent-like.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.959
You're a lot smarter than you look.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.420
Of course, you look like a retard.

07:37.129 --> 07:38.000
It won't work.

07:38.930 --> 07:40.470
I changed your pin number.

07:40.730 --> 07:43.990
I mean, your birthday? That's
the first thing a thief would try.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.120
What are you doing here?

07:46.730 --> 07:48.519
I changed it to 3-5-99.

07:50.329 --> 07:51.490
The day we met.

07:52.730 --> 07:56.310
- You have to stop doing this.
- Stop looking after you? Why?

07:56.930 --> 07:58.009
What do you want?

07:58.730 --> 08:01.079
I just want you to be
happy and healthy, silly.

08:01.129 --> 08:03.480
Speaking of, are you losing weight?

08:05.329 --> 08:07.430
I think it's the tranquilizers.

08:07.730 --> 08:10.329
How many did you take
in the bathroom at work, three?

08:11.329 --> 08:12.529
- How do you know--?
- To be honest...

08:12.529 --> 08:14.350
...they don't help with the anxiety.

08:14.930 --> 08:17.350
Now, I prescribed
a calcium selenium supplement.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.160
Did you take it?

08:20.329 --> 08:22.959
No, you threw it in the drawer
the minute you got home.

08:23.329 --> 08:24.939
These are for your own good.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.589
Why can't you just leave me alone?

08:29.930 --> 08:32.139
How can people in love
leave each other alone?

08:32.330 --> 08:33.700
In love?

08:34.129 --> 08:36.230
Ronald, we had one date.

08:37.129 --> 08:39.230
Honey, honey, don't get upset.

08:39.529 --> 08:42.620
I take commitment pretty seriously,
and I know you do too.

08:43.730 --> 08:45.870
Did you have a rough day
at work, is that it?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.830
Surgery. I have to run.

08:52.129 --> 08:54.200
Oh, don't forget
your money, sweetheart.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.730
I'll see you tonight.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.980
Angel Investigations.
We help the hopeless.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.120
I'd say right away.

09:20.330 --> 09:21.200
She's coming in.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.340
I gotta change my shirt.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.659
It's been going on about seven months.

09:28.129 --> 09:29.570
It wasn't so bad at first.

09:29.929 --> 09:30.799
What's his name?

09:31.129 --> 09:34.289
Dr. Ronald Meltzer.
He's a neurosurgeon.

09:35.330 --> 09:37.539
I had an infected nerve
behind my right eye.

09:37.730 --> 09:39.830
He operated and saved my sight.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.269
Afterwards, he asked me out.

09:42.529 --> 09:44.669
I didn't really want to, but....

09:44.929 --> 09:46.960
He helped you, you felt obligated.

09:47.929 --> 09:49.299
Plus, a doctor.

09:49.730 --> 09:52.120
So we had one drink, one time...

09:52.730 --> 09:54.480
...and he started calling me, a lot.

09:54.529 --> 09:57.059
Then he started showing up
at my work, my apartment...

09:58.129 --> 10:00.759
...saying we had something special,
that we should marry.

10:01.129 --> 10:02.460
I said I wasn't interested.

10:02.929 --> 10:04.009
Then it got worse?

10:04.129 --> 10:05.710
I know it sounds stupid...

10:06.529 --> 10:09.690
...but I can feel him
watching me all the time.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.480
Today, he knew I took my Xanitab...

10:12.529 --> 10:14.779
...when I was alone in the bathroom.

10:15.529 --> 10:17.110
He's just everywhere.

10:17.929 --> 10:20.029
I don't think I can take
much more of this.

10:20.929 --> 10:22.259
Well, we're gonna help you.

10:22.730 --> 10:24.940
Bigtime. And for a reasonable fee.

10:28.129 --> 10:31.220
- Doyle will see you home safely.
- Thanks. You've been really kind...

10:31.730 --> 10:33.309
...listening to me...

10:34.129 --> 10:35.710
...and it's terrible.

10:36.529 --> 10:39.230
- We're gonna take care of that.
- No, I mean the coffee.

10:41.330 --> 10:42.309
Angel...

10:42.529 --> 10:44.039
...how did you know I needed help?

10:45.529 --> 10:47.600
I have a friend
at the police department.

10:50.330 --> 10:51.870
I'll check in with you later.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.259
Can you imagine? A doctor.

10:55.730 --> 10:59.169
They examine your body.
They know every inch of you.

11:01.129 --> 11:02.320
How's he doing it?

11:02.929 --> 11:06.090
How does he see her
when she's alone, in private?

11:07.730 --> 11:09.169
Is he invisible?

11:10.730 --> 11:13.570
Or some kind of ghost?
Maybe he can astral project.

11:13.730 --> 11:15.980
Maybe he has an accomplice
or a hidden camera.

11:16.730 --> 11:18.549
Not everything has to be creepy.

11:19.129 --> 11:20.460
No, but Doyle had a vision.

11:20.929 --> 11:24.860
Which last time led to a sex-changing,
tear-out-your-innards demon. Right.

11:25.730 --> 11:28.330
I guess they don't call you
for the everyday cases.

11:29.929 --> 11:32.179
He sees her when he's nowhere around.

11:32.929 --> 11:33.870
How?

11:34.730 --> 11:38.279
Okay, flesh, anytime you want
to stop crawling is okay with me.

13:19.129 --> 13:20.320
Hello, Kate.

13:22.129 --> 13:23.210
Angel.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.070
Hi. It's good to see you.

13:26.929 --> 13:27.799
You too.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.450
Judging by your discomfort,
I'd say...

13:30.529 --> 13:33.340
...you're about to ask me out
on a date or you need a favor.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.519
And I'm gonna go with favor.

13:37.129 --> 13:39.159
So ask, and I'll see if I can do.

13:40.129 --> 13:42.059
A girl. A client.

13:42.529 --> 13:45.299
She's being stalked.
I think it could get ugly.

13:46.129 --> 13:50.340
She's being stalked, then ugly
it already is. What's her name?

13:50.929 --> 13:52.889
You don't have to stay
with me all day.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.889
I'm here to protect and serve.
If I'm not in the way.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.190
I like it.
As long as you're not bored.

13:58.730 --> 14:01.190
No, I'm good.
Got the word jumble right here.

14:01.730 --> 14:04.399
Should keep me occupied,
sadly, for most of the day.

14:05.929 --> 14:09.440
I feel better now. I guess Angel's
handled a lot of cases like this?

14:10.129 --> 14:12.549
Dozens. Hundreds.
Dozens of hundreds.

14:13.129 --> 14:14.429
It happens that often?

14:14.929 --> 14:17.210
Well, exactly like yours?
Not quite so many.

14:17.929 --> 14:19.860
But protecting women such as yourself?

14:20.330 --> 14:24.259
Oh, yeah, there's been four,
and three of them are very much alive.

14:25.129 --> 14:26.320
Is that you?

14:28.730 --> 14:30.240
Yeah, bungee jumping.

14:31.129 --> 14:33.870
I always meant to do that,
but I intensely don't want to.

14:34.129 --> 14:37.990
- So I haven't gotten around to it yet.
- It's fun. It's scary.

14:38.929 --> 14:41.070
You don't seem like
the thrill-seeker type.

14:42.529 --> 14:44.139
Well, I used--

14:44.929 --> 14:47.210
I used to do a lot
of things, you know, before....

14:47.929 --> 14:50.179
Don't worry. When Angel's
done with this case...

14:50.929 --> 14:53.700
...I guarantee you'll be wanting
to jump off a bridge again.

14:55.730 --> 14:58.220
Your girl did file
a report two months ago.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.899
The doctor responded
and denied everything.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.409
A lot of noise from his lawyers.

15:04.129 --> 15:05.039
What?

15:05.929 --> 15:07.580
His lawyers. Wolfram and Hart.

15:07.730 --> 15:09.730
- You know the name?
- I've heard it.

15:10.129 --> 15:13.149
They're the law firm Johnnie Cochran
is too ethical to join.

15:13.730 --> 15:16.259
They actually filed
a restraining order against her.

15:17.330 --> 15:21.580
Very cute. There's still no record
of violence from the doctor.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.000
Yet.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.679
- You think he's gonna blow?
- I do.

15:27.529 --> 15:28.730
I'll put a uniform on her.

15:28.730 --> 15:31.289
I probably can't spare one
for more than a day or two.

15:32.330 --> 15:35.659
- Thanks. That'll help.
- And your client? She's holding up?

15:37.129 --> 15:39.230
She's scared.
He's put her on the ropes.

15:39.529 --> 15:42.690
Help her get mad. That's the only
way she'll be able to fight him.

15:43.730 --> 15:45.590
I'll fight him.
That's why she hired me.

15:46.129 --> 15:48.590
That's not what I mean.
He could go to jail tomorrow...

15:49.129 --> 15:51.480
...and still kill her
in her dreams every night.

15:52.129 --> 15:55.289
I've put these creeps away.
It's hard to know he's still winning.

15:55.730 --> 15:58.330
She's still afraid.
He took this girl's power away.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.590
Nobody can get it back
for her but her.

17:05.690 --> 17:08.079
- You're a miracle worker.
- Oh, thank you.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.299
If you'll step right over here.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.569
What are you doing in my office?

17:40.490 --> 17:42.170
Name's Jensen. I must talk to you.

17:42.890 --> 17:45.029
- Then make an appointment.
- I don't have time.

17:45.289 --> 17:48.200
- I heard you do things nobody else can.
- I'm calling security.

17:48.890 --> 17:51.730
My wife has a malignant tumor
pressing on her ocular cavity.

17:52.490 --> 17:54.950
She'll die unless someone
has the nerve to operate.

17:56.690 --> 17:59.430
You're talking about a
difficult and dangerous procedure.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.480
I could lose my license.

18:02.089 --> 18:04.509
I understand your situation,
but I can't help you.

18:06.289 --> 18:07.900
- What does she mean to you?
- What?

18:08.690 --> 18:10.490
Is she your wife? Your girlfriend?

18:10.490 --> 18:13.329
- She's my fiancée.
- Nice. You set a date?

18:14.690 --> 18:17.109
- We're working that out.
- Did you know right away?

18:18.289 --> 18:19.369
That she was the one?

18:19.490 --> 18:21.809
- I don't see how this has--
- I'll tell you how.

18:22.490 --> 18:23.930
Know what it is to be so close...

18:24.289 --> 18:26.430
...you don't know where
they end and you begin?

18:27.289 --> 18:28.690
Would you die for her?

18:30.890 --> 18:31.759
Yes.

18:32.089 --> 18:34.480
Then you understand I won't
make any compromises.

18:35.089 --> 18:38.529
I won't watch her suffer and die
while the law catches up with science.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.750
What I will do is pay you
whatever it takes.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.190
Think about it. Please.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.839
Another article about Meltzer?

18:58.769 --> 19:00.910
Well, our readers at...

19:01.769 --> 19:04.650
... The Journal of Diagnostic
Orthopae-- Et cetera...

19:04.769 --> 19:06.490
...seem endlessly fascinated by him.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.799
He is fascinating. Before he
became an ocular surgeon...

19:10.170 --> 19:11.710
...he specialized in orthopedics.

19:12.569 --> 19:15.759
He developed nerve and blood vessel
accelerants that helped many.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.380
- How?
- Well, when you sever a limb...

19:18.569 --> 19:21.059
...you only have so much time
before it atrophies.

19:21.569 --> 19:23.710
- Yuck.
- What?

19:24.569 --> 19:26.849
Nothing. Please go on.

19:27.569 --> 19:30.519
Meltzer's work extended
that period of time significantly.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.420
He's one of the best
at reattaching nerves.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.380
So he's good at the cutting
and the sewing.

19:36.569 --> 19:38.500
He ever strike you
as a dangerous creep?

19:38.970 --> 19:42.019
What? What kind of article
are you writing?

19:43.769 --> 19:46.650
I've gotta be honest.
It may not be a very nice one.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.089
I don't like the way he treats women.

19:50.369 --> 19:51.809
I'll keep your name out of it...

19:52.170 --> 19:54.910
...but just between us,
what is the real dish on this guy?

19:59.970 --> 20:01.549
He's not very generous.

20:01.769 --> 20:04.750
He doesn't share his techniques
with the medical community...

20:05.369 --> 20:09.440
...and a lot of what he claims
to have done is pretty radical.

20:11.369 --> 20:12.380
Like what?

20:12.569 --> 20:15.900
Reattachment of eyes, for one thing.
He can do anything with a knife.

20:16.769 --> 20:18.980
Oh, you so don't want
this guy fixated on you.

20:19.769 --> 20:22.750
What is stalking now, the third
most popular sport among men?

20:23.369 --> 20:24.700
Fourth, after luge.

20:25.170 --> 20:27.130
I don't get it. He has a lot to lose.

20:27.569 --> 20:29.849
What about Melissa
has got him going all O.J.?

20:30.569 --> 20:32.920
Nothing. It's not about her.
It's about rage.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.180
He's too messed up
to deal with a real woman...

20:35.970 --> 20:38.569
...so he creates a fantasy
about a girl he barely knows.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.000
She'll fail him,
and he has to hurt her...

20:41.369 --> 20:44.420
...because when he looks at her,
all he sees is how useless he is--

20:44.970 --> 20:48.200
What a fun date you must have been
back in your bad vamp days.

20:49.170 --> 20:52.539
But, it should give you some insight
into the jerks of the world.

20:53.369 --> 20:55.789
I know how he thinks.
I don't know how he does it.

20:56.369 --> 20:57.700
Being everywhere at once?

20:58.170 --> 21:02.000
Natpudan says we're everywhere at once
since we're made of the same molecules.

21:02.369 --> 21:05.990
I remember that guy, made a big noise
a few years back on public television.

21:07.170 --> 21:10.819
- Then had a big case of Joe Recluse.
- He had a nervous breakdown...

21:11.369 --> 21:13.049
...not long after he had a retreat...

21:13.170 --> 21:15.099
...for a group of famous
yogis and doctors.

21:15.569 --> 21:17.779
I'm guessing Dr. Stalker
was at that retreat?

21:18.569 --> 21:21.240
- What are you doing?
- Sending Joe Recluse an e-mail.

21:22.170 --> 21:23.220
I need to talk to him.

21:23.369 --> 21:27.019
"I hope you have the nerve to believe
I need help with Ronald Meltzer."

21:28.769 --> 21:31.680
"Thanks for having the nerve to--"
Did you steal this book?

21:32.369 --> 21:34.119
- Yeah.
- Good.

21:34.809 --> 21:36.559
You said in your e-mail...

21:37.809 --> 21:40.160
...that Dr. Meltzer
might hurt an innocent woman.

21:40.809 --> 21:42.839
What do you think I can do about that?

21:43.210 --> 21:44.890
Help me understand him better.

21:45.609 --> 21:47.470
I don't think he's like other people.

21:48.009 --> 21:51.450
No, he's not. Of course,
no two people are alike.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.859
God, in His infinite variety and
wisdom, likes to keep it interesting.

21:57.009 --> 21:59.400
- How'd you meet him?
- He came to one of my lectures.

22:00.009 --> 22:02.400
My operating thesis at the time
was that the mind...

22:03.009 --> 22:06.059
...is the single most powerful
force in the universe.

22:06.609 --> 22:09.769
In any average human,
it regulates billions of cells.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.950
And that's with 80 percent
of the brain still untapped.

22:13.809 --> 22:17.069
What are the possibilities if a
person could master all that power?

22:17.410 --> 22:20.920
I introduced Dr. Meltzer
to psychic surgeons.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.809
Yogis who are able to shut down...

22:25.809 --> 22:28.619
...their somatic systems
for days at a time.

22:29.410 --> 22:31.160
But he eclipsed us all.

22:31.809 --> 22:36.089
Until Dr. Meltzer, my studies had
been based on hearsay and theories.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.490
But he exploded all that.

22:40.809 --> 22:42.529
That's when I stopped teaching.

22:43.210 --> 22:44.890
Because you stopped believing?

22:45.009 --> 22:46.200
No.

22:47.410 --> 22:49.160
Because I began to believe.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.740
Completely.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.640
All right, pal.

23:37.809 --> 23:39.490
Why don't you just turn around?

23:39.609 --> 23:40.839
Nice and easy.

23:41.410 --> 23:42.920
Put your hands up.

23:44.410 --> 23:45.849
I was just out for a walk.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.230
Hands. Now.

24:06.609 --> 24:07.869
I'm sorry.

24:09.009 --> 24:10.380
We got a report of someone--

24:11.410 --> 24:12.349
Not you.

24:13.210 --> 24:14.819
That's quite all right, officer.

24:15.609 --> 24:17.539
Just doing your job. I understand.

25:00.089 --> 25:02.480
- What's wrong? Did someone break in?
- He's--

25:03.089 --> 25:04.809
I can't help if you don't tell me.

25:04.890 --> 25:07.099
Did someone break in
or you had a bad dream?

25:07.890 --> 25:09.049
In there.

25:21.690 --> 25:22.769
Okay.

25:23.490 --> 25:25.069
Everything's okay now.

25:25.289 --> 25:27.109
Look, there's no one in your bedroom.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.410
There's no one in your bathroom.

25:30.089 --> 25:32.549
Now, start from the beginning.
Just tell me--

25:46.890 --> 25:48.079
It's me. It's me.

25:48.690 --> 25:50.339
He's in there. He's--

25:51.089 --> 25:52.700
His-- His hands.

25:52.890 --> 25:54.329
I know what he can do.

25:54.690 --> 25:57.950
He killed a-- Please don't leave
me alone. Please don't leave me.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.170
It's all right.
I'm not gonna let him near you.

26:38.490 --> 26:41.190
Here, drink up, love. It's over now.

26:42.089 --> 26:45.319
- She's not making much sense.
- She's been living in terror.

26:45.690 --> 26:47.440
- You think it's the doctor.
- I know it.

26:48.089 --> 26:50.410
How could he do it?
She has bars on the windows.

26:51.089 --> 26:53.970
The security cameras in the hallway
show officers going in...

26:54.690 --> 26:56.339
...and nobody suspicious all day.

26:56.490 --> 26:59.160
- I mean, who is this guy? Houdini?
- Something like that.

27:00.089 --> 27:03.039
I've pulled prints.
If they match his, he's going down.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.970
Detective, can you sign
the coroner's release?

27:15.690 --> 27:18.150
- How's she doing?
- Numb. They get any prints?

27:18.690 --> 27:20.970
- Yeah.
- Good, so we put him behind bars...

27:22.890 --> 27:26.220
...for about 90 seconds
until he skitters through them.

27:27.089 --> 27:28.700
Not many things make me shudder...

27:28.890 --> 27:31.170
...but this guy,
crawling around under the covers?

27:33.089 --> 27:35.119
At least it was just
his hands down there.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.759
- I wish I hadn't even thought that.
- He's coming undone.

27:39.089 --> 27:41.089
- I'll say.
- I mean, he's out of control.

27:41.490 --> 27:42.539
He's killing now.

27:43.289 --> 27:45.750
Anybody that stands
between him and his obsession.

27:47.490 --> 27:48.650
You okay?

27:49.289 --> 27:51.359
We stand between
him and his obsession.

27:51.690 --> 27:53.619
Not putting too cowardly
a point on it...

27:54.089 --> 27:57.420
...but if this guy can't be contained
or killed, what are we gonna do?

27:58.289 --> 28:01.730
His body parts go too long without
blood and oxygen, they deteriorate.

28:01.890 --> 28:05.150
He can't put himself back together.
Not even with psychic surgery.

28:06.089 --> 28:08.160
So we break him down and box him up?

28:08.490 --> 28:10.000
Of course, it's just a theory.

28:12.089 --> 28:13.599
What do we do in the meantime?

28:15.089 --> 28:16.420
Protect her.

28:17.289 --> 28:20.619
It's not good for the ventilation,
but he's not getting in here.

28:21.490 --> 28:23.309
I was just trying to fix your collar.

28:23.890 --> 28:26.660
What say we leave it crooked
until this is resolved?

28:26.890 --> 28:28.819
I don't see how this can--

28:29.890 --> 28:31.779
I mean, this can't be happening.

28:32.289 --> 28:34.289
What I saw. You must think I'm crazy.

28:34.690 --> 28:36.160
No, I believe you.

28:36.490 --> 28:38.490
But, it's not possible.
He can really--?

28:39.490 --> 28:40.569
Yes.

28:41.289 --> 28:43.920
Remember I told you I handle
things the police can't?

28:44.289 --> 28:46.990
Now, this is one of those things.
I'll take care of him.

28:47.890 --> 28:51.009
Doyle and Cordelia will stay with you.
Try to get some rest.

28:58.089 --> 29:01.640
- Here.
- Thanks, but I'm not gonna cry anymore.

29:02.289 --> 29:04.390
I'm tired of crying and being afraid.

29:05.289 --> 29:07.539
- Don't be afraid.
- You're duct-taping for fun?

29:07.690 --> 29:09.789
You survived a living hell
these last months...

29:10.089 --> 29:12.369
...while he's coming unhinged
at not controlling you.

29:13.089 --> 29:16.710
- He's weak. You're strong.
- He knows what he's talking about.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.079
He has stalked plenty of--

29:20.289 --> 29:22.079
Books on the subject.

29:22.690 --> 29:25.150
Could I see you upstairs for a moment?

29:26.289 --> 29:28.569
Melissa stays here with us,
that makes sense.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.500
The part about you
taking care of the doctor?

29:31.690 --> 29:34.250
This guy is really dangerous.

29:35.289 --> 29:36.269
What are you doing?

29:36.490 --> 29:38.839
Seeing where I can get
steel boxes at this hour.

29:39.490 --> 29:41.140
Steel boxes? Why would you want--?

29:41.289 --> 29:43.960
Oh, for packing up people parts.

29:44.289 --> 29:47.170
This job-- Don't get me wrong,
I'm grateful to have it.

29:47.890 --> 29:50.630
God knows it's educational
and all, but sometimes--

29:52.690 --> 29:53.880
Who's calling at this--?

29:56.289 --> 29:57.369
It's the special line.

29:58.690 --> 30:00.480
- Answer it.
- Right, right. Okay.

30:01.089 --> 30:02.950
Are we Johnson International Holdings?

30:03.490 --> 30:05.450
- Jensen.
- Jensen. Good, got it.

30:05.890 --> 30:08.630
Jensen. Now, does that sound
like an international--?

30:08.890 --> 30:09.900
Cordelia.

30:12.490 --> 30:14.910
Jensen International Holdings.
May I help you?

30:15.490 --> 30:17.170
- Mr, Jensen,
- Please hold.

30:17.890 --> 30:18.940
It's him.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.500
- Brian Jensen.
- You're working late,

30:25.690 --> 30:26.920
Downside of being global.

30:27.490 --> 30:29.700
If you still want,
I'll operate on your wife.

30:29.890 --> 30:30.829
I do, thank you,

30:31.690 --> 30:35.450
We have to do it out of the country.
I'll need $100,000 to get started.

30:35.890 --> 30:37.079
Are you in your office?

30:37.690 --> 30:39.160
I'll bring it to you tonight.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.480
You're going there?
What if he comes apart on you?

30:43.089 --> 30:46.039
If he comes apart on me,
he's gonna stay that way.

31:01.690 --> 31:02.990
That's a big box.

31:03.490 --> 31:05.630
You didn't have to
bring it in small bills.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.559
- Actually, I didn't bring--
- Any money at all?

31:10.089 --> 31:11.490
No, I didn't think you would.

31:11.890 --> 31:14.630
Although the safety deposit box
was a nice touch.

31:14.890 --> 31:17.700
Your name's not really Jensen.
You don't have a wife.

31:19.089 --> 31:20.670
What a tangled web, eh?

31:26.289 --> 31:28.180
I developed this injector for animals.

31:29.289 --> 31:31.319
They don't like having
their limbs cut off.

31:32.289 --> 31:34.150
They can hurt you
if you get too close.

31:35.289 --> 31:37.779
You'll feel a slight
sinking sensation.

31:38.289 --> 31:41.029
That's your heart slowing
as the paralytic takes effect.

31:41.890 --> 31:43.680
Eventually, it'll stop altogether.

31:46.089 --> 31:48.299
I just can't get over the audacity.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.420
To think you could take her from me?

31:51.490 --> 31:52.890
I saw you holding her.

31:53.289 --> 31:56.200
Nobody can break the bond
between us. Nobody.

31:58.690 --> 32:00.759
Clearly, even she can't accept that.

32:02.890 --> 32:05.730
I've tried so hard to show her
in so many ways.

32:07.089 --> 32:09.160
I've taken care of her,
been there for her...

32:09.490 --> 32:11.000
...even when she didn't know it.

32:11.890 --> 32:15.079
If that's not devotion....
What do I get for my trouble?

32:15.490 --> 32:17.589
She lies. She cheats.

32:18.490 --> 32:19.680
But no more.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.309
I won't be made a fool of.

32:25.089 --> 32:26.910
She would've made a beautiful bride.

32:44.569 --> 32:46.150
I got everything, I think.

32:49.369 --> 32:50.670
She's resting.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.029
What did you put in her tea?

32:53.569 --> 32:57.750
Enough whiskey to drop my Aunt Judy.
That woman had some girth.

32:59.569 --> 33:03.500
- What's the point?
- It tastes good and it relaxes you.

33:04.369 --> 33:06.470
No, I mean of ever
going out with anyone.

33:07.369 --> 33:09.160
Well, people need people.

33:10.369 --> 33:12.759
And people who need people...

33:13.369 --> 33:15.299
...I mean, are the luckiest peo--

33:15.769 --> 33:17.569
If you like them, they don't like you.

33:17.569 --> 33:20.519
Or you can't stand them, which
guarantees they'll hover around...

33:21.170 --> 33:22.779
...and never go away.

33:24.170 --> 33:27.960
I hate guys like that. It's-- Yeah.
I'm gonna check on her.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.250
It's just so unfair.

33:31.369 --> 33:34.849
This poor girl hooks up with a doctor.
That should be a good thing.

33:35.569 --> 33:39.430
You should be able to call and say,
"Mom, guess what? I met a doctor."

33:40.369 --> 33:42.400
Not "Guess what?
I met a psycho stalker.

33:42.769 --> 33:46.670
By the way, his hands and feet come
off, and he's not even in the circus!"

33:47.569 --> 33:49.990
Not every relationship
leads to disaster.

34:00.170 --> 34:02.839
- What if Angel doesn't come back?
- He'll be back.

34:03.769 --> 34:07.029
- What if Dr. Chop Salad shows up?
- I got this place sewn up now--

34:09.170 --> 34:10.250
What was that?

34:27.170 --> 34:28.500
Just the wind.

34:37.889 --> 34:40.030
Want to play some cards
or watch the tube?

34:40.289 --> 34:43.699
Sure. How about some gin?
A penny a point?

34:44.489 --> 34:45.889
Yeah, you'll owe me money.

34:46.289 --> 34:48.360
Yeah, we'll see about that.

35:09.090 --> 35:09.960
Cordelia.

35:30.090 --> 35:31.280
Whoa.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.139
Hi.

36:16.889 --> 36:17.940
Getting some rest?

36:19.289 --> 36:20.449
What are you?

36:21.090 --> 36:24.710
I'm more than meets the eye. But you
never bothered to find out, did you?

36:25.289 --> 36:27.389
You just took advantage
of my kindness.

36:28.289 --> 36:31.980
Led me on until you could find
yourself a vacuous L.A. pretty boy.

36:36.690 --> 36:38.719
You disappoint me, Melissa.

36:40.289 --> 36:41.619
I know. I didn't mean--

36:42.090 --> 36:44.510
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Stop, now. You're babbling!

36:45.690 --> 36:48.739
I think--
I think you disappoint yourself.

36:50.489 --> 36:52.519
You gave up on being loved
a long time ago.

36:52.889 --> 36:55.139
Now you're another creep
who gets off on pain.

36:55.289 --> 36:58.030
- Don't use childish--
- I'd be crazy to want to touch you...

36:58.889 --> 37:02.369
...to wake up next to little pieces
of whatever you are.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.119
- Shut up!
- You turned yourself into a freak.

37:05.489 --> 37:08.159
A vile, repulsive freak.
I'm done being afraid of you.

37:08.489 --> 37:12.000
You can cut me, and you can kill me.
It still won't change what you are.

37:13.889 --> 37:15.539
Angel was right, you're weak.

37:15.690 --> 37:18.179
I'm weak? Then how is it
that I killed him?

37:19.889 --> 37:20.760
Inefficiently.

37:21.090 --> 37:23.440
You can't be alive. You're not human.

37:24.090 --> 37:25.489
You should talk.

37:46.289 --> 37:48.079
We could have been so happy.

37:48.690 --> 37:49.880
Ronald!

38:01.289 --> 38:02.519
You all right?

38:15.010 --> 38:18.420
Oh, goody. Recycled coffee.
My personal favorite.

38:28.809 --> 38:31.130
He'll never put himself
back together, right?

38:31.210 --> 38:33.809
He's in 12 steel boxes buried
in 20 feet of concrete...

38:34.809 --> 38:36.320
...in L.A.'s newest subway stop.

38:36.610 --> 38:38.400
That ought to bring in the tourists.

38:39.010 --> 38:39.880
Hey.

38:40.809 --> 38:42.280
- Hi.
- Hey. How's it going?

38:42.610 --> 38:44.050
I brought this for you guys.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.300
Oh, hope it doesn't need light.

38:46.809 --> 38:48.110
It'll be fine in here.

38:49.210 --> 38:51.530
- Can I offer you some coffee?
- Coffee? Oh, no.

38:51.610 --> 38:54.869
I can only stay a minute.
Places to go. People to see.

38:55.809 --> 38:57.210
Thanks to you.

39:03.610 --> 39:05.780
- There's....
- What?

39:06.610 --> 39:08.119
There's a bill....

39:09.010 --> 39:09.920
Bill who?

39:10.210 --> 39:11.610
The bill. For my services.

39:12.010 --> 39:15.170
Oh. Of course.
That's the other reason I came.

39:16.809 --> 39:19.090
- Here.
- I'll take that, thanks.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.699
I mean, I didn't do it
for the money.

39:22.210 --> 39:23.650
Oh, please. You earned it.

39:25.809 --> 39:26.929
Well...

39:28.210 --> 39:29.610
...I hope I never see you again.

39:31.210 --> 39:32.469
Me too. Good luck.

39:33.010 --> 39:34.059
Thanks.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.530
That didn't go so badly.

39:39.610 --> 39:43.679
You can save the girl and make money.
Is this a great country or what?

39:44.409 --> 39:47.429
Let's march down to the bank right now
and deposit this beauty.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.130
You guys go. I think I'll stay here
and not burst into flames.

39:52.210 --> 39:54.670
Oh, right, you're pretty much
a night deposit guy.

39:55.210 --> 39:57.139
Well, still. Cause to celebrate.

39:57.610 --> 39:59.860
You think everything's
a cause to celebrate.

40:00.610 --> 40:03.099
- We need more of these.
- We'll have more soon enough.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.170
- Now. Have a vision.
- I can't perform on demand.

40:06.610 --> 40:08.889
- We need clients.
- Money's corrupted you.

40:09.610 --> 40:11.639
If I hit your head,
will you have a vision?

40:12.010 --> 40:13.619
Get away from me. You're insane.
