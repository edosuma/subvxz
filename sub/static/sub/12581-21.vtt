00:33.507 --> 00:37.603
PEGGY:
Welcome
to the Audubon Society's 43rd

00:37.645 --> 00:42.708
and Peggy Hill's First
Annual Backyard Bird Count.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.718
(gasps):
Look! The rare and beautiful

00:44.752 --> 00:45.719
Texas Nuthatch.

00:45.753 --> 00:51.817
Well, write it down,
people! Write it down!

00:51.859 --> 00:54.851
I have asked our Native American
friend, John Redcorn,

00:54.895 --> 00:58.092
to join us
as our expert bird identifier.

00:58.132 --> 01:00.225
My people believe,
when the world was new,

01:00.267 --> 01:02.394
the creator made all the birds.

01:02.436 --> 01:05.701
He colored their feathers and
told them to greet each day

01:05.740 --> 01:07.332
with a chorus of songs.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.003
Why you stop
fooling around

01:10.044 --> 01:11.568
with that John Redcorn?

01:11.612 --> 01:14.843
He is so smoking,
smoking hot.

01:14.882 --> 01:17.009
Hey, Dale's
hot, too...

01:17.051 --> 01:19.178
in his own way.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.915
Gribble team ready.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.923
I'm assuming
you'll want the heads

01:22.957 --> 01:24.754
for identification purposes.

01:24.792 --> 01:27.352
You're supposed to count
the birds, Dale.

01:27.395 --> 01:30.159
Eventually,
they will be counted.

01:30.197 --> 01:35.430
Oh! A bird!

01:35.469 --> 01:41.430
It's so, so beautiful.

01:44.278 --> 01:49.545
(laughing)

01:49.583 --> 01:53.041
(giggling)

01:53.087 --> 01:54.816
Ow.

01:54.855 --> 01:58.347
Get off.

01:58.392 --> 02:04.353
Get off! Get off me!

02:07.568 --> 02:08.535
Dang it, Dale.

02:08.568 --> 02:10.764
You are a professional
exterminator.

02:10.805 --> 02:12.602
You said you
could handle this.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.766
I'm on it.

02:13.808 --> 02:15.776
These birds don't
stand a chance

02:15.810 --> 02:18.711
against this ultrasonic
bird distress emitter.

02:18.746 --> 02:21.374
(evil laughter)

02:21.415 --> 02:24.782
I was up all night listening to
sounds that'll drive you crazy.

02:24.819 --> 02:30.485
(loud horn cacophony)

02:30.524 --> 02:32.515
(Dale laughing)

02:32.560 --> 02:37.395
How long does this
have to go on for?!

02:37.431 --> 02:38.398
Forever!

02:38.432 --> 02:39.399
Scram. Move!
Scoot. Go.

02:39.433 --> 02:42.163
I can't get inside
these pigeons' heads!

02:42.203 --> 02:45.138
Bill, you're a filthy
flocking animal.

02:45.172 --> 02:46.571
Would this scare you?

02:46.607 --> 02:47.574
Ooh.

02:47.608 --> 02:48.575
No.

02:48.609 --> 02:50.474
That's it.

02:50.511 --> 02:52.479
This job is too much for me.

02:52.513 --> 02:54.481
It's time to bring in
the big gun,

02:54.515 --> 02:57.575
the top-shelf pigeon
exterminator of Heimlich County,

02:57.618 --> 02:58.880
the pigeon god.

02:58.919 --> 03:00.477
Well, great. Call him up.

03:00.521 --> 03:02.785
She's a woman,
and are you a fool?

03:02.823 --> 03:04.188
The pest-control world

03:04.225 --> 03:07.126
insurmountably-colored,
propane candyland

03:07.161 --> 03:09.721
where you can
just call people.

03:09.764 --> 03:12.255
To get the baddest
of the baddest ass,

03:12.299 --> 03:14.494
promises must be exchanged,

03:14.535 --> 03:15.797
payola paid,

03:15.836 --> 03:17.895
reputations put
on the line.

03:17.938 --> 03:19.496
Sounds kinda scary.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.565
Oh, it is,
and then some.

03:21.609 --> 03:23.440
If the pigeon god...

03:23.477 --> 03:25.843
or to her parents,
Sheila Refkin, Ph. D...

03:25.880 --> 03:30.180
decides to stoop down
to help our piddly little cause,

03:30.217 --> 03:37.521
it will be as if witnessing
the beginning of time!

03:39.260 --> 03:41.660
Three more days and I am 21.

03:41.695 --> 03:43.162
Whoo! This is so exciting.

03:43.197 --> 03:46.689
I'm gonna be so much older
and maturer.

03:46.734 --> 03:50.067
Oh, I'm gonna get
really wasted at my party,

03:50.104 --> 03:53.301
so would one of you guys
be my designated driver?

03:53.340 --> 03:54.272
I'd love to.

03:54.308 --> 03:56.640
Wow. Thanks, Aunt Peggy.

03:56.677 --> 03:58.042
I will make your
birthday party

03:58.078 --> 03:59.545
so much fun, and

03:59.580 --> 04:01.741
I can be there to
gently remind you

04:01.782 --> 04:03.943
that as the daughter
of an alcoholic,

04:03.984 --> 04:06.282
you have a genetic gun
pointed at your head,

04:06.320 --> 04:07.787
and with every drink

04:07.822 --> 04:10.655
you are adding another
bullet to the chamber.

04:10.691 --> 04:14.320
Would you be
my designated driver?

04:14.361 --> 04:17.262
No, I-I don't really... No.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.663
It's okay, Uncle Hank.

04:18.699 --> 04:20.462
I'll just drive home drunk.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.800
There are so many great things
I can crash my car into...

04:23.838 --> 04:28.605
a ditch, a telephone pole,
a busload of babies!

04:28.642 --> 04:29.472
(sighs)

04:29.510 --> 04:30.943
Fine.

04:30.978 --> 04:36.041
Bobby,
eat your chicken!

04:36.083 --> 04:38.643
I can't eat this.

04:38.686 --> 04:40.950
They're watching me.

04:41.655 --> 04:44.852
(knocking)

04:44.892 --> 04:46.257
I did it.

04:46.293 --> 04:47.282
A meeting has
been arranged

04:47.328 --> 04:49.626
with the pigeon
god's assistant.

04:49.663 --> 04:51.756
We leave in five.

04:51.799 --> 04:54.199
DALE:
He's not here yet.

04:54.235 --> 04:55.293
It's a setup!

04:55.336 --> 05:01.104
Oh.

05:01.141 --> 05:03.109
Be cool.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.848
Ako manglangan ang

05:07.882 --> 05:09.474
kalapatl dlyos.

05:09.516 --> 05:13.919
(trap snaps)

05:13.954 --> 05:16.047
Hmm.

05:16.090 --> 05:22.393
Slya nasaln maarl
dlyan bukas.

05:22.429 --> 05:25.159
Arlen's best exterminator
is coming to our alley.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.598
What should I have her sign?

05:26.634 --> 05:28.261
My canister? My traps?

05:28.302 --> 05:34.207
My face?

05:37.711 --> 05:38.678
Oh, my God!

05:38.712 --> 05:41.704
If I start acting like a fool,
take me outwith this poison.

05:44.852 --> 05:45.819
Oh, wow.

05:45.853 --> 05:51.189
How y'all doing?

05:51.225 --> 05:54.160
Sheila Refkin,
Heimlich County Pest Management.

05:54.194 --> 05:56.719
This is one impressive
infestation.

05:56.764 --> 05:58.732
Was this neighborhood
built on a landfill?

05:58.766 --> 05:59.994
Uh...

06:00.034 --> 06:02.594
(high-pitched):
Dale Gribble.

06:02.636 --> 06:04.763
Uh! Dale's Dead Bug!

06:04.805 --> 06:08.400
Did I say Dale's
Bug Dead? Idiot!

06:08.442 --> 06:09.409
Dale Gribble!

06:09.443 --> 06:10.410
(sputtering)

06:10.444 --> 06:13.880
Whoa, that's some kinda
spray wand you got there.

06:13.914 --> 06:18.977
Bet you could blast one hell
of a gopher with that thing.

06:19.019 --> 06:23.820
I could blast through a
horse to get to the gopher.

06:23.857 --> 06:26.087
Look at the way
she applies that chemical.

06:26.126 --> 06:28.686
She has clearly read
the directions.

06:28.729 --> 06:29.923
Man, that dang
ol' Sheila,

06:29.964 --> 06:31.932
looking all pretty
like that, man.

06:31.966 --> 06:32.933
I'm talking
'bout my bedroom.

06:32.967 --> 06:34.935
Not talking about
no pigeons, man.

06:34.969 --> 06:35.936
SHEILA:
Dale, honey!

06:35.970 --> 06:36.937
Would you mind grabbing

06:36.971 --> 06:38.939
a caulking gun
and helping me out?

06:38.973 --> 06:39.940
Do you know
how many years

06:39.974 --> 06:43.933
I've wished Peggy
would ask me that?

06:47.381 --> 06:48.348
Naah!

06:48.382 --> 06:50.350
I don't deserve to be
administering chemical

06:50.384 --> 06:52.477
next to an exterminator
of your magnitude.

06:52.519 --> 06:54.453
I'm also
not licensed to.

06:54.488 --> 06:55.455
Oh, pooh.

06:55.489 --> 06:57.889
You have to squeeze
the trigger gently.

06:57.925 --> 06:59.893
Just pretend like
you're holding

06:59.927 --> 07:00.894
a pretty girl's hand.

07:00.928 --> 07:03.556
Pigeons hate anything
sticky on their feet.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.565
When the gel gets
on their foot,

07:05.599 --> 07:06.566
they fly away because

07:06.600 --> 07:08.568
they can't handle
the sensation.

07:08.602 --> 07:09.569
Eh!

07:09.603 --> 07:11.571
...and then Luanne
ditches me for Hank.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.665
I have driven
for 20 years

07:14.708 --> 07:17.836
without an accident... one
that wasn’t my fault, anyway.

07:17.878 --> 07:20.073
Who is that woman?

07:20.114 --> 07:22.082
Oh, that's the new
hotshot exterminator.

07:22.116 --> 07:23.310
Anyway,

07:23.350 --> 07:25.648
so Luanne
says to me...

07:25.686 --> 07:27.654
She's trouble.

07:29.456 --> 07:31.549
But wouldn't that
be poetic justice?

07:31.592 --> 07:32.559
I come back to Dale,

07:32.593 --> 07:35.027
and then he runs off
with another woman?

07:35.062 --> 07:36.654
(laughing)

07:36.697 --> 07:37.755
(laughing)

07:37.798 --> 07:41.029
Oh... I would say it's ironic,

07:41.068 --> 07:44.868
but you’re the one
it's happening to.

07:44.905 --> 07:49.239
You can call it
what you want.

07:49.276 --> 07:50.868
(laughs)

07:50.911 --> 07:51.969
(sobs)

07:52.012 --> 07:53.070
Excuse me.

07:53.113 --> 07:54.705
Dang ol'...

07:54.748 --> 07:56.909
(clears throat loudly)

07:56.950 --> 07:57.917
Nancy!

07:57.951 --> 07:59.179
I was just
telling Boomhauer

07:59.219 --> 08:01.210
that Sheila's
can and your can

08:01.255 --> 08:03.553
share some striking
similarities.

08:03.590 --> 08:05.057
Show him your can, Nancy.

08:05.092 --> 08:06.218
I don't think so.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.353
You know I don't
like you looking

08:08.395 --> 08:10.659
at other ladies'... areas.

08:10.697 --> 08:12.358
How can I help it?

08:12.399 --> 08:15.630
She's got your hot
bod and my hot mind.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.637
It's like some
science experiment

08:17.671 --> 08:19.502
that's gone
horribly right.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.507
Dale, honey!

08:20.541 --> 08:21.508
Could you bring me up

08:21.542 --> 08:24.477
the Johnson's Pestgo
Bird Repel Gel 320ml?

08:24.511 --> 08:25.478
Oh, man.

08:25.512 --> 08:29.004
I could talk about
the Johnson's Pestgo

08:29.049 --> 08:32.347
Bird Repel Gel 320 mil
for the rest of my life.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.751
Hey, Nancy, could
you grab it for me?

08:34.788 --> 08:37.154
It's right behind you.

08:37.191 --> 08:38.215
(laughs loudly)

08:38.258 --> 08:44.219
You have no idea
what that is!

08:47.935 --> 08:50.631
Oh, I-I shouldn't

08:50.671 --> 08:52.002
laugh at you.

08:52.039 --> 08:53.267
(snickers)

08:53.307 --> 08:56.276
But when you picked
up the Diazanon...

08:56.310 --> 09:00.940
Oh, I got to send that
in to "Bugs and Giggles."

09:11.625 --> 09:13.490
Yep.

09:13.527 --> 09:14.892
Yep.

09:14.928 --> 09:17.556
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.156
(laughing):
You're so funny.

09:19.199 --> 09:21.429
Yup.

09:21.468 --> 09:23.402
Pardon us
for being excited.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.667
We're unleashing some
pretty supreme chemical

09:25.706 --> 09:27.469
in the alley
this afternoon.

09:27.508 --> 09:29.772
Tell them about the chemical,
will ya, huh?

09:29.810 --> 09:32.244
Well, as you know,
pigeons live in a flock.

09:32.279 --> 09:33.678
So we pick
the alpha male.

09:33.714 --> 09:36.444
Then we feed him a
mild hallucinogen
called Avitrol.

09:36.483 --> 09:38.974
Which is cleverly disguised
as a kernel of corn.

09:39.019 --> 09:39.986
Bill, don’t eat

09:40.020 --> 09:40.987
any corn on
your lawn.

09:41.021 --> 09:42.079
And then the
other pigeons

09:42.122 --> 09:44.249
see their alpha
male flipping out.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.589
They say, "Hey, we don't want
any of that mess,"

09:46.627 --> 09:48.254
and the flock relocates itself.

09:48.295 --> 09:50.855
Isn't she a
freaking genius?!

09:50.898 --> 09:51.865
No, wait.

09:51.899 --> 09:54.333
She's a god.

09:54.368 --> 09:55.335
Oh...

09:55.369 --> 09:57.667
So I'm doing
an overnight

09:57.704 --> 09:59.865
at the Econo Suites
this weekend.

09:59.907 --> 10:02.102
Pigeons, rats,
silverfish.

10:02.142 --> 10:04.633
You feel like
coming along?

10:04.678 --> 10:06.703
You"re asking me
to join you

10:06.747 --> 10:07.907
on your route?

10:07.948 --> 10:11.850
I'd love to.

10:11.885 --> 10:12.852
And tomorrow
they're going

10:12.886 --> 10:15.480
on an overnight
extermination job

10:15.522 --> 10:17.490
just like
when John Redcorn and I

10:17.524 --> 10:19.492
went on our "migraine cruise"
to Ensenada.

10:19.526 --> 10:21.858
Well, you need to tell
Dale just to back off!

10:21.895 --> 10:23.294
Use this if you have to.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.696
Oh, how can I say
anything to him?

10:25.732 --> 10:27.757
I was Unchristian to Dale
for a long time.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.702
I just want
my sug back, sug.

10:30.737 --> 10:33.331
Maybe you should try to be
more involved in Dale's life.

10:33.373 --> 10:35.773
You know, be a bigger part
of his world.

10:35.809 --> 10:40.007
But Dale's world is so...

10:40.047 --> 10:41.139
I don't really want...

10:41.181 --> 10:42.341
No, I wouldn't either,

10:42.382 --> 10:45.146
but you seem to want
to save this thing.

10:53.293 --> 10:54.851
Yep.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.363
Mm-hmm.

10:59.933 --> 11:02.333
I totally agree
with you, Sheila.

11:02.369 --> 11:05.202
The second Lionel Jefferson
was much better.

11:05.239 --> 11:07.673
The first guy was
all 'fro, no show.

11:07.708 --> 11:13.977
Are we simpatico or what?

11:14.014 --> 11:16.175
I'm on the phone.

11:16.216 --> 11:17.240
Sheila, let me
call you back.

11:17.284 --> 11:19.479
Fine. Here's my ear...

11:19.519 --> 11:21.009
Touch it.

11:21.054 --> 11:23.022
I killed a spider
in the kitchen today.

11:23.056 --> 11:25.320
I cannot explain
the rush I got.

11:25.359 --> 11:26.849
So... I was thinking...

11:26.893 --> 11:31.853
there must be all
kinds of fun stuff
to kill on your route.

11:31.898 --> 11:32.990
Mind if I tag along?

11:33.033 --> 11:34.523
I dunno, Nancy.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.435
It takes a special
kinda lady to do what I do.

11:37.471 --> 11:44.309
I can be a
special kinda lady.

11:44.344 --> 11:46.869
(explosion)

11:46.913 --> 11:48.608
(yells)

11:48.649 --> 11:52.050
Ah! Nancy! Shoot it!

11:52.085 --> 11:57.182
This is what you do?!

11:57.224 --> 11:59.988
(Dale shrieking)

12:00.027 --> 12:01.995
So I'll pick you up at midnight?

12:02.029 --> 12:03.394
Honk twice so I don't shoot ya!

12:03.430 --> 12:06.763
Sug. Sugar.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.892
Suggie, sug, sug.

12:07.934 --> 12:10.562
I just wanted to
come out here

12:10.604 --> 12:12.834
and give you a
little present

12:12.873 --> 12:15.865
for including Dale on
this big job tonight.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.467
It's a gift
certificate.

12:17.511 --> 12:19.479
I figured a hard-working woman
like yourself

12:19.513 --> 12:21.105
might enjoy a nice massage.

12:21.148 --> 12:24.914
"John Redcorn's
New Age Healing Center."

12:24.951 --> 12:25.918
Sounds relaxing.

12:25.952 --> 12:28.386
Make sure to ask for
the "migraine special."

12:28.422 --> 12:31.653
That's the "migraine special."

12:31.692 --> 12:32.954
Oh, look at the certificate.

12:32.993 --> 12:33.960
It expires in two hours.

12:33.994 --> 12:35.188
You should go now. Now.

12:35.228 --> 12:40.825
Are there any special areas
you'd like me to focus on?

12:40.867 --> 12:46.828
Well, Nancy Gribble said
I should ask for the...

12:54.748 --> 12:58.184
"migraine special"?

12:58.218 --> 13:01.517
I'm sure Nancy told you
about the time I cured

13:01.555 --> 13:04.115
four of her migraines
in one night.

13:04.157 --> 13:06.182
Actually, I'm really more
Dale's friend.

13:06.226 --> 13:07.193
It's weird.

13:07.227 --> 13:09.195
Dale and I have only
known each other a few days,

13:09.229 --> 13:12.926
but we have this, um...
almost primal connection.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.797
You know, like bugs do.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.963
To receive the full benefit
of my therapeutic massage,

13:18.004 --> 13:20.495
you must quiet your mind.

13:20.540 --> 13:21.507
Oh, I can't help it.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.975
I'm so excited
about my job tonight.

13:24.010 --> 13:25.978
Dale and I have
so much fun together.

13:26.012 --> 13:27.980
The other day,
as a practical joke,

13:28.014 --> 13:29.914
he put a dead possum
in my Igloo cooler.

13:29.950 --> 13:30.917
We laughed!

13:30.951 --> 13:31.918
Dale...

13:31.952 --> 13:32.919
(sighs)

13:32.953 --> 13:38.448
What am I supposed to wear
to Luanne's birthday party?

13:38.492 --> 13:39.550
I need something that says,

13:39.593 --> 13:42.562
"I am not some weird,
old guy in the bar.

13:42.596 --> 13:44.496
I am here against my will."

13:44.531 --> 13:47.432
Some kind of designated driver
you are.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.231
Pressure's already
too much for you, huh?

13:50.270 --> 13:51.862
Well, God help Luanne.

13:51.905 --> 13:54.271
GIRL:
Oh! Happy
birthday, Luanne!

13:54.307 --> 13:55.467
(dejected sigh)

13:55.509 --> 13:58.410
Nancy, I feel I should warn you.

13:58.445 --> 13:59.537
Man, this is an awkward call.

13:59.579 --> 14:02.309
I think this woman
is interested in Dale.

14:02.349 --> 14:04.317
You shouldn't let him
go out tonight.

14:04.351 --> 14:06.319
Well, that's why I
sent her to you.

14:06.353 --> 14:08.480
What about the massage?

14:08.522 --> 14:09.318
It was just a massage.

14:09.356 --> 14:10.914
And she assumed
the tip was included

14:10.957 --> 14:13.152
in the gift certificate.

14:17.130 --> 14:18.688
What's up, Hefner?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.063
Hey, you take that back.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.068
I am the designated driver,

14:22.102 --> 14:26.095
and I'd like a wristband
that reflects that.

14:31.945 --> 14:33.879
That guy is
so handsome.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.314
And you can tell
by how hard he's laughing

14:36.349 --> 14:40.376
at that lady’s joke, that he's
got a great sense of humor.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.581
He's got a great sense
of ass in those jeans.

14:42.622 --> 14:44.021
Hey, hey, hey.

14:44.057 --> 14:50.018
...don't normally
pick up chicks in bars.

14:50.530 --> 14:52.725
Oh, God, no, no, no.

14:52.766 --> 14:56.031
I can't be
here for this.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.629
Hey, what's your name,
beautiful?

14:58.672 --> 15:02.369
It's Luanne,
but you could call me beautiful.

15:02.409 --> 15:06.072
I'm totally flirting
in a bar!

15:06.112 --> 15:10.071
I have never needed a beer
so bad in my entire life.

15:10.116 --> 15:14.815
I don't normally pick up chicks
in bars, but you're special.

15:14.855 --> 15:17.346
Kind of like the sunrise...

15:17.390 --> 15:18.687
in Italy.

15:18.725 --> 15:19.817
Have you ever been?

15:19.860 --> 15:21.725
You would love it.

15:21.761 --> 15:23.353
LUANNE:
Oh, my God!

15:23.396 --> 15:27.560
Are you inviting me to go
to Italy with you?

15:27.601 --> 15:29.432
(chuckles)

15:29.469 --> 15:34.304
I'm sorry, but this
is just so asinine.

15:34.341 --> 15:36.400
I'm going to get
another free soda.

15:36.443 --> 15:38.001
The sunrise...

15:38.044 --> 15:40.808
(laughs, moans)

15:43.550 --> 15:45.108
You ready?

15:45.151 --> 15:51.283
GIRL:
Pop-per! Pop-per! Pop-per!

15:51.324 --> 15:52.018
(coughs)

15:52.058 --> 15:53.685
No, I... I am the designated...

15:53.727 --> 15:56.389
Aw!

15:56.429 --> 15:59.489
(coughing)

16:06.373 --> 16:07.601
Oh, I tell ya, man,
that dang ol' pigeon's

16:07.641 --> 16:09.700
freakin' out, man.

16:09.743 --> 16:10.732
It's the chemicals.

16:10.777 --> 16:13.439
He's tripping.
And pretty hard.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.038
Come on.

16:15.081 --> 16:21.384
We'll get you through this,
little fella.

16:21.421 --> 16:23.889
(horn honks)

16:23.924 --> 16:26.085
I don't know why you need
to go outwith her tonight,

16:26.126 --> 16:27.457
but I'm not going
to stop you.

16:27.494 --> 16:28.688
I'm so nervous.

16:28.728 --> 16:30.286
Can you smell
my armpit?

16:30.330 --> 16:31.319
(sniffs)

16:31.364 --> 16:33.161
I don't think my
deodorant's working.

16:33.199 --> 16:34.166
(doorbell ringing)

16:34.200 --> 16:35.690
Dale, you cannot go!

16:35.735 --> 16:36.861
You just tell
your little friend

16:36.903 --> 16:38.302
to go on home.

16:38.338 --> 16:40.033
Well, that's not very friendly.

16:40.073 --> 16:44.134
I never told you to tell your
friend John Redcorn to go home.

16:44.177 --> 16:49.308
See you in
the morning.

16:59.693 --> 17:01.558
This is going to be
a long night, sug.

17:01.595 --> 17:03.062
Thanks for waiting with me.

17:03.096 --> 17:03.824
Mm-hmm.

17:03.863 --> 17:07.299
We will get through
this together.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.842
Maintain... Maintain...

17:23.883 --> 17:25.281
Maintain...

17:25.318 --> 17:27.843
Yeah, man, you’re just
home, you know, just chillin'

17:27.887 --> 17:29.514
with your lady
in your ol' nest, you know.

17:29.556 --> 17:31.114
You got little bird
in the sky, man.

17:31.157 --> 17:34.615
You know, you did poop
on my car, you know,

17:34.661 --> 17:36.322
but we’ll talk about that later,
you know.

17:36.363 --> 17:38.024
Don't worry about it
right now, you know.

17:38.064 --> 17:42.296
Ah. I just fell down,
and you know why?

17:42.335 --> 17:43.768
I'm drunk.

17:43.803 --> 17:45.634
So am I!

17:45.672 --> 17:46.900
But you’re
our driver.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.601
I can't drive,
and you can't drive.

17:48.642 --> 17:52.976
How are we going to drive
if we can't drive?

17:53.013 --> 17:55.846
Yeah, I know,
it's terrible, but...

17:55.882 --> 17:58.510
I put this song
on. It's mine.

17:58.551 --> 18:02.043
You've played the same damn
song six times in a row.

18:02.088 --> 18:05.922
"New rule"...you can't listen
to my song anymore.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.759
Oh. I'm having so much fun,
you guys.

18:09.796 --> 18:12.026
Ah, happy birthday, Luanne.

18:12.065 --> 18:14.056
Let's do this
every Friday night.

18:19.539 --> 18:20.801
This is so great.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.967
For the first time
in my life, I feel like

18:23.009 --> 18:25.341
I'm really detecting rat urine.

18:25.378 --> 18:28.973
Dale, all we ever
talk about is work.

18:29.015 --> 18:32.473
Let's take a break.

18:36.623 --> 18:38.557
LUANNE:
This is beautiful.

18:38.591 --> 18:39.580
Where are we?

18:39.626 --> 18:41.389
It's where I park
when the world

18:41.428 --> 18:42.827
doesn't make
any sense to me.

18:42.862 --> 18:47.765
Does this make any sense?

18:47.801 --> 18:50.235
HANK:
No!

18:51.037 --> 18:57.840
(R&B music plays)

18:59.846 --> 19:02.212
(snoring)

19:02.682 --> 19:04.673
Look at all those
pests out there.

19:04.718 --> 19:07.152
I wonder if we'll ever
win this war.

19:07.187 --> 19:11.214
Don't you just find
the mating habits of
animals fascinating?

19:11.257 --> 19:13.987
When a pigeon wants to
mate, it makes this noise.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.587
(cooling)

19:16.629 --> 19:17.857
Interesting.

19:17.897 --> 19:19.558
When cockroaches want to mate,

19:19.599 --> 19:21.931
they flush all the air
out of their book lungs.

19:21.968 --> 19:24.402
It sounds kind of like...

19:24.437 --> 19:26.769
(wheezing)

19:26.806 --> 19:29.001
(cooling)

19:29.042 --> 19:30.373
(wheezing)

19:30.410 --> 19:31.377
Well, it's getting late.

19:31.411 --> 19:33.379
You want to go downstairs?

19:33.413 --> 19:34.380
I got us a room.

19:34.414 --> 19:37.611
I'm warming up some brandy
in the coffee maker.

19:37.650 --> 19:38.844
Wait a second.

19:38.885 --> 19:41.149
Are you attempting to know me?

19:41.187 --> 19:43.587
Dale, you are one of
the sweetest, gentlest,

19:43.623 --> 19:45.250
funniest men I've ever met.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.258
True,

19:46.292 --> 19:47.759
but Sheila, I'm married.

19:47.794 --> 19:49.318
It’s just us tonight.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.556
Oh, no, Missy.

19:50.597 --> 19:52.690
There are three people
here tonight.

19:52.732 --> 19:53.699
You, me

19:53.733 --> 19:54.700
and my wife.

19:54.734 --> 19:57.794
I've taken two oaths
in my life.

19:57.837 --> 20:01.830
One to the NRA and the other
to Nancy Hicks-Gribble,

20:01.875 --> 20:03.843
nee Nancy Hicks.

20:03.877 --> 20:06.710
I stood in front of God
and all my friends

20:06.746 --> 20:09.647
swearing to be an honorable
and truthful man.

20:09.682 --> 20:10.979
So I'm not going to lie,

20:11.017 --> 20:15.716
I h-have felt a very small,
insect-like attraction for you,

20:15.755 --> 20:16.722
but my wife

20:16.756 --> 20:19.953
is the greatest woman
there ever was.

20:19.993 --> 20:21.961
I think you should go.

20:23.663 --> 20:28.623
(cooling)

20:28.668 --> 20:29.566
Geez, woman,

20:29.602 --> 20:31.797
take a hint.

20:31.838 --> 20:33.931
(cooling)

20:33.973 --> 20:41.470
You heard me.
I love my wife.

20:41.514 --> 20:42.674
Dale?

20:42.715 --> 20:43.841
Man, you should have seen

20:43.883 --> 20:45.874
the size of this roach
I couldn't kill.

20:45.919 --> 20:48.979
We are never staying
at the Econo Suites.

20:49.022 --> 20:52.014
Hey, did you know Sheila
was trying to come on to me?

20:52.058 --> 20:54.083
No. Really?

20:54.127 --> 20:56.595
Yeah, she was all over me.

20:56.629 --> 20:57.596
It was weird.

20:57.630 --> 20:59.291
She knows I'm married.

20:59.332 --> 21:02.859
Oh, wingo,
I didn't miss my show.

21:02.902 --> 21:04.699
You want to watch it with me?

21:04.737 --> 21:07.831
Sure.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.326
That was a hell of a night.

22:10.870 --> 22:16.831
