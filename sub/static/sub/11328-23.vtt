WEBVTT

00:02.901 --> 00:05.701
Things are better for both of you-
you and your son--

00:05.734 --> 00:09.400
if you'd just stop fooling around
every time you get an opportunity

00:09.434 --> 00:12.934
and get serious about yourself
and who you're gonna be in life.

00:12.968 --> 00:16.100
We haven't been very
involved as grandparents,

00:16.133 --> 00:18.801
and we want to be more involved.

00:18.834 --> 00:21.734
That way you can be more
involved in your son's life.

00:21.767 --> 00:23.300
And by "fun," you mean-- Sex.

00:23.334 --> 00:26.300
It's freeing to think I don't
have to be the good girl.

00:26.334 --> 00:28.133
Fun, as we know, has consequences.

00:28.167 --> 00:29.667
So I guess the two
of you are friends

00:29.701 --> 00:31.834
after everything was
said and done? Yes.

00:31.867 --> 00:34.767
I don't wanna start over.
I just wanna end this. I'm ending this.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.267
So, can we still hang out

00:36.300 --> 00:38.734
as friends-- you and me?
Of course, Grace.

00:38.767 --> 00:40.367
Thanks for letting me come
over on a school night.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.334
Thanks for letting me
come over any night.

00:42.367 --> 00:45.567
Let's see if we're still in love a year
from now when our anniversary rolls around.

00:45.601 --> 00:48.400
And if we are, let's get
remarried on our anniversary.

00:48.434 --> 00:50.367
No, I'm not doing that.
I wanna get married now.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.701
I wanna take John on weekends. No.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.767
I don't wanna hurt my
relationship with my son

00:54.801 --> 00:59.901
over a lifetime by not doing
what I should be doing.

01:01.001 --> 01:03.634
No wonder this man has success.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.667
He shouldn't just
be the Sausage King,

01:05.701 --> 01:07.601
he should be the Sausage Czar.

01:07.634 --> 01:10.034
That is a damn fine piece of meat.
So, about John--

01:10.068 --> 01:12.034
Oh, yeah. You gonna take
him on the weekends? Am I?

01:12.068 --> 01:14.367
Isn't that what you said?
I said I wanna take him on the weekends.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.867
That's why I wanted
you to come over here.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.634
So you could see
where I'm taking him.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.068
I'm all set up for him here.
I've got all the safety stuff--

01:20.100 --> 01:23.500
cabinet locks, the outlet covers,
the corner bumpers on the furniture.

01:23.534 --> 01:26.034
I've got a high chair, food,
an earthquake kit for two.

01:26.068 --> 01:27.534
I can take care of my kid.

01:27.567 --> 01:29.167
You got any more sausage biscuits?

01:30.534 --> 01:33.434
Something can still happen.
Something always happens.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.867
He's gonna fall, bump his head,
split his lip, something.

01:35.901 --> 01:37.801
No, he's not. They all do.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.801
You just gotta make sure that the
worst thing that could happen

01:39.834 --> 01:41.300
is not the worst thing
that does happen.

01:41.334 --> 01:42.834
That's called parenting, my friend.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.434
Split his lip?
Girls did it a few times.

01:45.467 --> 01:48.601
He can't fall and split his lip.
I'd get accused of child abuse.

01:48.634 --> 01:50.601
Yeah, different times. Back in the old days,
no one said anything.

01:50.634 --> 01:52.734
I was an abused child.
Someone will say something

01:52.767 --> 01:55.334
if anything like that happens-
if an accident happens.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.267
That's why they do it.
That's why they say something.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.100
That's why they ask questions. 'Cause
when kids got abused in the old days,

02:00.133 --> 02:03.367
when they went to the doctor or the
emergency room, no one asked them anything.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.968
So now you're gonna
be like everyone else.

02:05.001 --> 02:06.968
So if there's an accident,
expect questions.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.199
You prepared for that?
I hadn't even thought of that.

02:09.233 --> 02:11.467
Why don't you stay at your parents'
on the weekend when you have John?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.734
Because I want him to myself.
This is my home.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.400
I got this place so I could be with John--
just the two of us.

02:16.434 --> 02:19.267
I'm just pointing out the worst that could
happen. Now you made me all nervous.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.434
Good. You'll be extra careful.
You'll be alert, on your toes.

02:22.467 --> 02:24.100
This pork or beef? What?

02:24.133 --> 02:25.767
The sausage. It's pork.

02:25.801 --> 02:28.200
Wow. Okay. Gotta go to work.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.534
Are you gonna talk to Amy?
About what?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.367
About John coming
over here on weekends.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.300
Oh. You have to talk
to her about that.

02:34.334 --> 02:36.667
I thought you just wanted my blessing.
And you have my blessing.

02:36.701 --> 02:38.500
I'm happy for you to take
John on the weekends.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.034
It's good for John and for Amy.

02:40.068 --> 02:42.034
So go forth, young man,
and ask Amy.

02:42.068 --> 02:43.701
I did. She said no.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.300
Well, then the answer's no.
I rescind my blessing. What?

02:46.334 --> 02:48.300
I take it back.
I know what "rescind" means.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.133
I got it off my Word of the Day
Calendar Donovan gave me for Christmas.

02:51.167 --> 02:53.734
Gotta go. Mr. Juergens, please,
could you just talk to Amy?

02:53.767 --> 02:57.233
Tell her it's not such a bad idea.
I'm really determined to do this.

02:57.267 --> 03:00.167
All right. I'll talk to her. But if she's
made up her mind, she's made up her mind.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.233
How about a compromise?
I don't think so.

03:02.267 --> 03:03.734
I guess we all knew
it'd come to this--

03:03.767 --> 03:05.667
all the adults in your
life and Amy's life.

03:05.701 --> 03:07.801
I just didn't know it
was coming this soon.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.534
All right. I'll do what I can.
But I can tell you,

03:10.567 --> 03:14.601
you just fired the first shot
of what could be a lifelong war.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.701
<i>* Falling in love </i>

03:20.734 --> 03:23.968
<i>* Is such an easy thing to do *</i>

03:24.001 --> 03:26.667
<i>* Birds can do it We can do it *</i>

03:26.701 --> 03:29.100

Let's get to it *</i>

03:36.467 --> 03:38.534
Hey, where are the moms?
The nursery.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.267
John and Robbie are
all cranked out today.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.767
Oh, good.

03:41.801 --> 03:44.133
No, not good. Not good at all.

03:44.167 --> 03:45.968
Not for you anyway.

03:46.001 --> 03:48.801
And I think Mom's coming
down with something.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.834
She's losing her voice.
That could be good.

03:50.867 --> 03:53.934
She's not happy about it.
She doesn't wanna get the babies sick.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.200
Would you mind if Grant
came over tonight?

03:57.233 --> 03:59.767
<i>There's a Twilight Zone marathon.
One condition:</i>

03:59.801 --> 04:03.068
You talk to Amy and you tell her it's a
good idea for Ricky to take John on the
weekends.

04:03.100 --> 04:06.701
I just talked to her last week telling her
what a good mother she is and everything.

04:06.734 --> 04:09.534
You're good at it. If you don't watch your
tone, I'll make you talk to her every week.

04:09.567 --> 04:12.001
How did you even get in the middle
of Ricky and Amy's stuff anyway?

04:12.034 --> 04:13.667
Amy's been screaming
about Ricky all day

04:13.701 --> 04:15.567
which is why John and
Robbie are all cranked out.

04:15.601 --> 04:17.399
So is Mom.
She's in a bad mood, too?

04:17.434 --> 04:20.466
Who's in a bad mood?

04:20.500 --> 04:22.367
You look pretty.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
See?

04:28.934 --> 04:30.901
Why'd she say that? 'Cause you do.
You look pretty.

04:30.934 --> 04:32.801
You don't sound so good,
but you look pretty.

04:32.834 --> 04:35.334
I don't wanna get married for a while,
and I don't wanna argue about it tonight.

04:35.367 --> 04:37.434
I've been dealing with Amy all day.

04:37.467 --> 04:40.968
All of a sudden, it seems that Ricky
wants to have John on the weekends.

04:41.001 --> 04:42.500
He wants to pick up
John on Friday nights

04:42.534 --> 04:44.801
and have Amy pick him up
from him on Sunday nights.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.734
Oh. Hmm?

04:46.767 --> 04:48.901
Well, what would be
the problem with that?

04:48.934 --> 04:51.867
The problem would be that
Amy doesn't wanna do that.

04:51.901 --> 04:53.767
She wants to decide when
John can go over there.

04:53.801 --> 04:55.167
When does she think John
should go over there?

04:55.200 --> 04:56.434
Whenever she says he
can go over there.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.100
So Ricky's just on call?
He's gotta sit around

04:58.133 --> 04:59.767
and hope Amy lets him see his son?

04:59.801 --> 05:02.034
Well, that's what she wants,
and I suggest that we stay out of it.

05:02.068 --> 05:05.167
I wish you suggested that earlier before
I dropped by Ricky's this morning.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.001
Well, maybe I would've
suggested it earlier

05:07.034 --> 05:08.767
if I'd known that's where
you were going this morning.

05:08.801 --> 05:11.233
You see, if we were married,
I'd have to tell you where I'm going.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.133
But we're not married.
So there you go.

05:13.167 --> 05:14.934
Well, if you had been home,
I would've told you

05:14.968 --> 05:17.500
that I'd told Ricky's parents that we
would have dinner with them tonight

05:17.534 --> 05:19.167
so we could talk about it.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.601
So you didn't need to talk to Ricky.
Amy's okay with that?

05:21.634 --> 05:24.300
I didn't ask her. She doesn't
know anything about it,

05:24.334 --> 05:26.567
and she doesn't need to
know anything about it.

05:26.601 --> 05:29.467
The mood that she's in, she'll just
think that we're turning against her.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.534
Isn't Ricky's dad in prison?
We going to prison for dinner?

05:32.567 --> 05:34.934
His foster parents-
Margaret and Shakur.

05:34.968 --> 05:39.167
I see. So your refusal to put
yourself in the middle of things

05:39.200 --> 05:41.300
seems to have put you
in the middle of things.

05:41.334 --> 05:44.534
No, it hasn't. I'm not getting
in the middle of Amy and Ricky.

05:44.567 --> 05:47.667
I'm going around them,
and I'm taking you with me.

05:47.701 --> 05:49.500
I don't wanna see Amy
have to go to court.

05:49.534 --> 05:52.667
I want Amy and Ricky to work
out an agreement on their own.

05:52.701 --> 05:54.934
Dad, you have to talk to Ricky.
Way ahead of you.

05:54.968 --> 05:57.500
Really? You told him he can't
take John on the weekends?

05:57.534 --> 05:59.734
I told him I'd talk to you
about it. But I won't,

05:59.767 --> 06:02.767
because this is something that you and
Ricky need to work out on your own.

06:02.801 --> 06:05.968
And I suggest that you do it before a
judge or a mediator does it for you.

06:06.001 --> 06:08.834
Or your parents.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.534
Dad, you don't want a
judge or a mediator

06:12.567 --> 06:14.601
deciding what's best for
your grandson, do you?

06:14.634 --> 06:18.334
Well, of course not. So maybe you and
Ricky could work out some compromise.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.734
No. This is how it works:
I get John all the time

06:20.767 --> 06:24.200
because I gave birth to him after
stupidly having sex with that idiot.

06:24.233 --> 06:26.467
And now the idiot does
not get to take him.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.167
I get to decide when and if
Ricky gets to see his son.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.934
And that's the way it works.

06:30.968 --> 06:33.200
Well, right now. That's probably
worked fine for a while.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.434
But John's getting older,
and so are you and so is Ricky,

06:35.467 --> 06:38.300
so things might just
change a little. No.

06:38.334 --> 06:40.801
If you didn't have John on the weekends,
you could go out, have a life.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.734
I'll tell you what,
you wanna go have a life,

06:42.767 --> 06:45.767
you wanna go out, why don't you give
Robbie to Ricky on the weekends, huh?

06:45.801 --> 06:48.167
Why don't you do that? 'Cause I don't
want a life. I want your mother.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.334
Well, here's the difference
between you and me:

06:50.367 --> 06:53.567
I'm gonna get what I want,
and you're not.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.567
Come in.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.133
Hi. How are you?

07:03.567 --> 07:05.367
What? I'm not gonna
hit you or anything.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.001
I came over here to support you.

07:07.034 --> 07:09.233
What? I heard about Ricky
trying to take John.

07:09.267 --> 07:11.167
Where did you hear that?
Ricky told Ben.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.934
Ben told Grace. Grace told me.

07:12.968 --> 07:15.001
And I think it's terrible. Really?

07:15.034 --> 07:16.834
Yeah, I do. The guy runs away,

07:16.867 --> 07:18.734
and then comes back and
wants more responsibility?

07:18.767 --> 07:20.434
Yeah. That's what I said.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.001
I feel so bad for you.

07:22.034 --> 07:24.233
Don't feel bad for me.
Ricky's not gonna get John.

07:24.267 --> 07:25.934
I don't blame you for
feeling that way.

07:25.968 --> 07:29.001
The guy can't be trusted.

07:29.034 --> 07:32.601
It was just a kiss, right? Yes,
Adrian, it was just a kiss.

07:32.634 --> 07:34.601
But you had sex with Ben.
That wasn't just a kiss.

07:34.634 --> 07:36.534
And I wanna apologize for that.

07:36.567 --> 07:39.034
If I hurt you in any way,
I'm really sorry.

07:39.068 --> 07:40.901
I wasn't trying to hurt you, Amy.

07:40.934 --> 07:42.567
I was trying to hurt Ricky.

07:42.601 --> 07:45.834
You know, I don't really
like him right now.

07:45.867 --> 07:49.034
Mmm. What do you know.
We have something in common.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.534
And when people have
something in common,

07:51.567 --> 07:54.634
like a common hate for someone,
what do you call those people?

07:54.667 --> 07:56.901
What? Friends.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.834
And you're gonna need friends.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.968
Because if you don't give Ricky
what he wants, he'll go to court.

08:01.001 --> 08:02.801
And when he goes to court
and you go to court,

08:02.834 --> 08:06.034
he's gonna have his friends,
and you're gonna have yours.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.267
And you're gonna need all
the friends you can get.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.190
It's not gonna get that far.

08:18.224 --> 08:20.659
They're not going to court-
Ricky and Amy.

08:20.693 --> 08:22.661
Adrian thinks so.

08:22.695 --> 08:25.998
Amy's just upset.
And I've seen her upset.

08:26.032 --> 08:28.066
But she'll get over being upset,
and she'll realize

08:28.101 --> 08:30.169
that Ricky should have
John on the weekends.

08:30.203 --> 08:32.604
He's his son. I think
it's perfectly reasonable

08:32.639 --> 08:34.907
for Ricky to have his son
for part of the time.

08:34.941 --> 08:37.308
I think you should have
John part of the time. Me?

08:37.342 --> 08:40.511
Hello. You were there every day for
the first nine months of his life.

08:40.547 --> 08:43.649
Well, maybe not every day.
I did go to Italy.

08:43.683 --> 08:47.486
Yeah, you did. Tell me about Italy.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.722
Oh, I'd rather not. Come on.

08:50.757 --> 08:53.225
Did you have sex in
Italy with Maria?

08:53.259 --> 08:56.495
No. Grace, I, uh-
I'd rather not talk about this.

08:56.529 --> 09:00.365
She's cute. I saw her.
She looks like a lot of fun.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.467
Have you ever been to Italy?

09:02.502 --> 09:06.138
No, I haven't, but I'd like to go.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.174
Maybe you and I could
go together sometime.

09:09.209 --> 09:12.177
You could show me around.
Or we could go somewhere else.

09:12.212 --> 09:14.379
We could go somewhere
neither of us has been.

09:14.414 --> 09:16.481
Or we could go somewhere
you've been, and I haven't,

09:16.516 --> 09:18.050
and you could show me around.

09:18.084 --> 09:19.651
Have you ever seen my bedroom?

09:21.955 --> 09:24.022
That's funny. Uh...

09:24.057 --> 09:25.891
No, I haven't seen your bedroom.

09:25.925 --> 09:27.826
Well, would you like to?

09:27.861 --> 09:29.361
No one's home.

09:29.395 --> 09:31.363
Maybe you could give
me a tour of the house.

09:31.397 --> 09:33.031
I haven't really seen the house.

09:33.066 --> 09:36.401
Okay. We'll start with my bedroom.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.074

09:48.681 --> 09:50.616
I'm in here.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.221
This is a nice room.

09:56.256 --> 09:58.690
It looks kind of like
I thought it might.

09:58.725 --> 10:00.692
Not that I've thought
about it too much.

10:00.727 --> 10:03.495
Just if I had thought about it...

10:03.529 --> 10:05.931
I have thought about it.

10:05.965 --> 10:07.299
What are we doing here, Grace?

10:07.333 --> 10:09.034
I wanna make out.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.802
In your bedroom with no one home?

10:10.837 --> 10:12.871
That's usually the best time,
isn't it?

10:12.906 --> 10:15.240
I thought we were
just friends. We are.

10:15.275 --> 10:16.975
I don't wanna really do anything.

10:17.010 --> 10:19.478
But making out's a fun thing to do,
don't you think?

10:19.512 --> 10:21.713
Honestly, I just don't
wanna get in any trouble.

10:21.748 --> 10:24.950
I mean, the last time I made out,
it didn't have the best consequences.

10:24.984 --> 10:27.219
That's 'cause you were making
out with the wrong person.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.221
You make a compelling argument.

10:34.827 --> 10:35.994
*

10:36.029 --> 10:37.329
Oh...

10:37.363 --> 10:39.231
You gonna answer that? Yeah.
I'm sorry.

10:39.265 --> 10:41.667
It might be my dad.

10:44.504 --> 10:45.904
Take it.

10:45.939 --> 10:48.040
Really? We're just friends.

10:48.074 --> 10:50.876
Friends that were about
to make out. Take it.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.644
Hello?

10:52.679 --> 10:53.679
Hello? Ben?

10:53.713 --> 10:55.314
Hi, Amy. Is everything okay?

10:55.348 --> 10:57.582
I just thought we should talk.
Can you come over?

10:57.617 --> 10:59.551
I can't right now.

10:59.585 --> 11:02.254
He's hanging out with me. Hi, Amy.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.522
Grace?

11:03.556 --> 11:05.357
<i>Adrian? Hi, Grace.</i>

11:05.391 --> 11:07.426
Hi, Adrian.
Amy, can I call you back?

11:07.460 --> 11:09.628
Tell them to come over here. What?

11:09.662 --> 11:12.764
You need all the
friends you can get.

11:12.799 --> 11:15.634
Um, Ben, I need your help
with something. Grace's, too.

11:15.668 --> 11:18.804
What's that, Amy? I need you
and Grace to be on my side

11:18.838 --> 11:22.741
if Ricky and I get into
some legal thing about John.

11:22.775 --> 11:24.776
You'd do that for me, right, Ben?

11:24.811 --> 11:26.712
I, um...

11:26.746 --> 11:28.280
Don't wanna get in the middle.

11:28.314 --> 11:30.849
I really don't wanna get
in the middle of this, Amy.

11:30.883 --> 11:33.585
I'm sure that you and Ricky can work out
whatever it is you need to work out.

11:33.619 --> 11:37.556
You've always been in the
middle of this, Ben Boykewich.

11:37.590 --> 11:39.791
And now Amy needs you,
so get over here.

11:39.826 --> 11:42.060
You and Grace. You're her friends.

11:42.095 --> 11:43.662
Amy needs you to make a statement

11:43.696 --> 11:46.131
she can use in court to say
what a good mother she is.

11:46.165 --> 11:48.200
And you know what a
good mother she is,

11:48.234 --> 11:49.735
so do it.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.671
Either come over here or
do it yourself, but do it.

11:54.407 --> 11:58.777
See? This is just the kind of thing
that can bring people together.

12:01.481 --> 12:03.181
So, do you wanna go over there?

12:03.216 --> 12:04.716
No.

12:06.819 --> 12:08.353
We can make a video.

12:08.388 --> 12:10.222
For us or for Amy?

12:10.256 --> 12:12.190
Amy. Of us doing this?

12:12.225 --> 12:14.026
I know what you mean.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.395
Do we have to do that right now?

12:16.429 --> 12:17.496
No.

12:17.530 --> 12:18.864
Okay.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.367
I can't believe
that I would ask Ben

12:22.402 --> 12:25.237
to do my any favors
after what he did.

12:26.706 --> 12:29.941
Amy, guys do stupid things.

12:29.976 --> 12:33.678
If you had had sex with Ben,
I would've never had sex with Ben.

12:33.713 --> 12:36.248
He wouldn't even have been
interested in having sex with me.

12:36.282 --> 12:38.583
I would've had to have sex with
someone else to get back at Ricky.

12:38.618 --> 12:41.319
This is not my fault.
Stop trying to make it my fault.

12:41.354 --> 12:44.289
It is partially your fault,
so just accept some of the responsibility

12:44.323 --> 12:46.224
as well as my apology.

12:46.259 --> 12:48.093
I'm so confused.

12:48.127 --> 12:50.195
Let me un-confuse you.

12:50.229 --> 12:53.665
You are the mother of the child.
You're in charge of the child's life.

12:53.699 --> 12:55.867
You have to do what's best for him,
and what's best for him

12:55.902 --> 12:57.836
is to see his dad on the weekends.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.604
What's best for John
is to see Ricky.

12:59.639 --> 13:02.240
And it's best for John to have a
routine and have some stability,

13:02.275 --> 13:04.242
and Ricky can help with that.

13:04.277 --> 13:06.178
And it's good for a boy
to have his father around,

13:06.212 --> 13:08.680
so get over yourself,
make the sacrifice, give in.

13:08.714 --> 13:11.416
No. I have sacrificed all
I'm going to sacrifice.

13:11.451 --> 13:13.452
Ricky does not get
John every weekend.

13:13.486 --> 13:15.454
That's all there is to it.
I've made my decision.

13:15.488 --> 13:17.823
All right. Well, I just told
Dad I would talk to you.

13:17.857 --> 13:20.125
Hi, Adrian. Hi, Ashley.

13:20.159 --> 13:21.927
She's too young to understand.

13:21.961 --> 13:24.863
And again, I'm sorry
I slept with Ben.

13:24.897 --> 13:27.099
And me, too.

13:27.133 --> 13:30.135
Adrian, I wanted to sleep with Ben.

13:30.169 --> 13:32.070
I really did.

13:32.105 --> 13:34.206
I always thought he'd
be my first and my last.

13:35.641 --> 13:37.876
The second and my last.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.811
Yeah, and I thought
Ricky would be my last.

13:39.846 --> 13:43.315
Adrian, I appreciate that
you came over here tonight,

13:43.349 --> 13:47.285
but I really don't think that I'm ready
to forgive you for having sex with Ben.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.322
I don't think I'll ever be able
to forget that you did that.

13:50.356 --> 13:52.958
And I'm never gonna be able to
forget that you had sex with Ricky.

13:52.992 --> 13:55.727
Here's where girls screw up.

13:55.761 --> 13:58.730
The guys have already forgiven
each other and moved on.

13:58.764 --> 14:02.000
For all you know, Ricky's already
gotten Ben and Grace on his side.

14:02.034 --> 14:04.136
So you and I need to forgive
each other and move on,

14:04.170 --> 14:06.771
because it's the best thing
for your son-- for John.

14:06.806 --> 14:10.175
Look, Ricky is not a stable person.

14:10.209 --> 14:12.177
Just because he's the
biological father

14:12.211 --> 14:14.412
doesn't mean he's the best father.

14:14.447 --> 14:16.781
Look, there's gotta be a
better father out there.

14:16.816 --> 14:19.985
You need a guy who's gonna stand
by you and stand up to Ricky.

14:20.019 --> 14:21.920
Who is that guy, Amy? I don't know.

14:21.954 --> 14:23.421
You know.

14:23.456 --> 14:24.956
What's-his-name.

14:24.991 --> 14:27.492
Um, you know, the guy--

14:27.527 --> 14:29.828
your-- your mother's
boyfriend's son.

14:29.862 --> 14:31.796
Oh. You know,
the guy with the hair.

14:31.831 --> 14:34.633
Uh, Jimmy. Yes. Call him.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.701
And call Lauren and
Madison and Jack

14:36.736 --> 14:38.703
and Zoe and Claire-- What? Who?

14:38.738 --> 14:40.205
They slept with Ricky.

14:40.239 --> 14:42.140
They know he's not daddy material.

14:42.175 --> 14:43.808
Look, you get anyone you can get,

14:43.843 --> 14:45.977
and we'll get videos of
them as character witnesses.

14:46.012 --> 14:48.079
A judge or a mediator-- whoever--

14:48.114 --> 14:50.015
is not going to
question my character.

14:50.049 --> 14:51.516
They're gonna question
Ricky's character.

14:51.551 --> 14:53.552
I've done nothing wrong.
I don't need to prove myself.

14:54.654 --> 14:56.288
Why would they
question my character?

14:56.322 --> 14:58.690
Um, you're the one
who got pregnant.

15:06.904 --> 15:07.738
This is fun.

15:08.022 --> 15:10.457
Shut up. I like the
way you say that.

15:10.491 --> 15:13.794
Shut up. I can't believe we
got conned into babysitting.

15:13.828 --> 15:16.096
I don't mind.
I'm good with children.

15:16.130 --> 15:19.233
Yeah, I am, too.
But that's besides the point.

15:19.267 --> 15:22.336
The point is Robbie is
not our responsibility.

15:22.370 --> 15:25.806
No. But someday we might have
responsibilities of our own.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.610
Someday I may not want to have
responsibilities of our own.

15:31.145 --> 15:33.680
'Cause I'm so tired of my
mother's responsibilities

15:33.715 --> 15:36.783
and my sister's
responsibilities and...

15:37.819 --> 15:40.721
Babies are great birth control.

15:40.755 --> 15:43.090
Birth control, huh?

15:43.124 --> 15:44.892
Yeah.

15:44.926 --> 15:47.928
You have, um...

15:47.962 --> 15:49.930
Do you use--

15:49.964 --> 15:52.099
I have condoms.

15:52.133 --> 15:55.435
But I'm not planning on needing a
condom before I get out of high school.

15:55.470 --> 15:58.872
But if you did need or want a condom,
you'd have one available nearby?

15:58.907 --> 16:00.274
Yeah.

16:00.308 --> 16:02.609
So you've at least anticipated
using a condom before?

16:02.644 --> 16:04.811
Who hasn't,
besides my mother and Amy?

16:07.749 --> 16:09.416
You had sex?

16:09.450 --> 16:11.218
No. Have you?

16:11.252 --> 16:13.220
Yeah, it probably wouldn't
hurt the kid to watch

16:13.254 --> 16:14.821
<i>a couple episodes of The
Twilight Zone.</i>

16:14.856 --> 16:17.124
Well, that wasn't a no.
Rod Serling's a genius.

16:17.158 --> 16:19.626
Yeah. You're not. You're
clearly avoiding the question.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.664
Yes.

16:23.698 --> 16:24.965
Yes, what?

16:24.999 --> 16:26.967
I've had sex.

16:27.001 --> 16:28.969
All right. "All right"?

16:29.003 --> 16:30.904
Yeah, all right.

16:30.939 --> 16:33.040
Doesn't mean you and
I are gonna have sex.

16:33.074 --> 16:36.176
No. Does it mean you and I
could possibly have sex?

16:36.210 --> 16:38.912
Not tonight, but sometime
in the next year?

16:38.947 --> 16:40.614
I'm 15.

16:40.648 --> 16:43.650
I wanna wait until I
get out of high school.

16:43.685 --> 16:45.652
I mean, I want to.

16:45.687 --> 16:48.355
I don't know if I will.

16:48.389 --> 16:50.357
That's why I have the condoms.

16:50.391 --> 16:54.528
But...I'm definitely
not ready. Got it.

16:54.562 --> 16:56.463
Yeah, so, if that's what you're
looking for, go somewhere else.

16:56.497 --> 16:58.031
That's not what I'm looking for.

16:58.066 --> 16:59.833
I just want you to
be my girlfriend.

16:59.867 --> 17:03.170
I don't have to have sex with
you to be your girlfriend, do I?

17:03.204 --> 17:05.137
'Cause I'm not having sex with you.

17:05.173 --> 17:08.541
Oh. I'd never push you
to have sex with me.

17:08.576 --> 17:10.577
Although I wouldn't
push you away, either.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.914
I'm a gentleman.

17:13.948 --> 17:16.650
I'll let you come to me...
when you're ready.

17:16.684 --> 17:19.685
Don't hold your breath. I'm a swimmer.
I can hold my breath for years.

17:19.721 --> 17:21.387
Good. You may have to. I will.

17:21.422 --> 17:24.491
Let's see how long you
can hold your breath. Go.

17:28.863 --> 17:30.430
Four seconds.

17:32.867 --> 17:34.768
I'm so happy

17:34.802 --> 17:36.703
that we're finally getting together

17:36.738 --> 17:39.740
to talk about John
and Ricky and Amy.

17:39.774 --> 17:41.108
Oh, me, too.

17:41.142 --> 17:43.510
I'm so sorry that it's
taken so long to call you.

17:43.544 --> 17:46.980
We'd be happy to keep an eye on John
on Saturdays when Ricky's at work.

17:47.015 --> 17:49.549
Well, I'm sure you know
we've been foster parents

17:49.584 --> 17:51.551
to a lot of children
over the years,

17:51.586 --> 17:53.320
and we've had a lot of
babies in the house.

17:53.354 --> 17:57.224
We both love babies and
children and our son Ricky.

17:57.258 --> 18:01.895
And we would be very happy to
have more time with our grandson.

18:01.929 --> 18:03.897
We want to get to know John,

18:03.931 --> 18:07.401
and we want to make sure
that he gets to know us.

18:07.435 --> 18:13.140
You know, Ricky lived with us
in foster care for many years,

18:13.174 --> 18:16.810
and we consider him our son.

18:16.844 --> 18:19.479
He's really a very special kid.

18:19.514 --> 18:24.051
Well, not kid. Young man.

18:24.085 --> 18:27.054
We agree. We both like him a lot.

18:27.088 --> 18:30.323
And we understand that he
wants to spend more time

18:30.358 --> 18:32.359
with John and with all
of you on the weekends.

18:32.393 --> 18:34.428
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

18:34.462 --> 18:38.365
We just feel that Amy should be
the one to make the decision.

18:38.399 --> 18:40.600
She is the mom.

18:42.303 --> 18:43.503
What?

18:43.538 --> 18:45.872
I think that what
they might want to say

18:45.907 --> 18:47.774
is Ricky's the dad.

18:47.809 --> 18:49.609
Well, they can say that
if they wanna say that.

18:49.644 --> 18:51.478
Ricky's the dad.

18:51.512 --> 18:53.013
I know that.

18:53.047 --> 18:55.649
I just feel that if he
would back off a little,

18:55.683 --> 19:00.554
that maybe in time, Amy would change
her mind or be willing to compromise.

19:00.588 --> 19:02.222
How much time?

19:02.256 --> 19:04.624
John's gonna be a year old soon.

19:04.659 --> 19:08.595
I don't know how much time. You're both
aware that I'm a social worker, right?

19:08.629 --> 19:12.466
I've been through a
few hundred cases

19:12.500 --> 19:16.369
over the years involving
teenage parents,

19:16.404 --> 19:19.106
and while judges

19:19.140 --> 19:22.242
favored the mother in the past,
that's not the case anymore.

19:22.276 --> 19:25.312
So if Ricky decides
to take this to court

19:25.346 --> 19:27.981
or to a mediator,

19:28.015 --> 19:30.650
they're probably gonna
rule in his favor.

19:30.685 --> 19:32.285
Yep.

19:33.721 --> 19:36.123
I really hope that Ricky's
not gonna take this to court

19:36.157 --> 19:37.791
or have it mediated.

19:37.825 --> 19:40.193
Amy has been through
so much this past year.

19:41.696 --> 19:43.396
Not that Ricky hasn't.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.271
I know I'm not with
Adrian anymore, but...

19:51.305 --> 19:52.772
You know why I'm not with Adrian.

19:52.807 --> 19:54.608
We're just no good for each other.

19:54.642 --> 19:56.376
Right now I just wanna
focus on my son.

19:56.410 --> 19:59.079
At one time,
you offered to help me.

19:59.113 --> 20:02.115
Would you still help me? Would you
please tell me how to solve this legally?

20:02.150 --> 20:04.184
I want a legal agreement.
All right.

20:04.218 --> 20:09.156
Well, probably the best thing
is for you to get a mediation.

20:09.190 --> 20:11.858
I don't think you wanna
get into a court case.

20:11.893 --> 20:14.895
And just be prepared that
it could go either way.

20:14.929 --> 20:18.732
The mediator's recommendation might be
what you want, or it might go another way.

20:18.766 --> 20:22.102
They might recommend that you see
John less than you're seeing him now,

20:22.136 --> 20:24.905
or that you only get
supervised visitation rights.

20:24.939 --> 20:26.406
You never know how things will go.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.074
All I know is that I wanna do this.

20:28.109 --> 20:29.743
I'm sick of the uncertainty.

20:29.777 --> 20:31.745
The only way I'm gonna feel
like I've done a better job

20:31.779 --> 20:33.880
as a parent than my mother
did is if I speak up.

20:33.915 --> 20:35.882
Okay.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.084
Well, here's the thing.

20:38.119 --> 20:41.054
I'll talk to your parents
and to Amy's parents,

20:41.088 --> 20:42.689
and I'll set this
up for all of you.

20:42.723 --> 20:44.691
But only on one condition:

20:44.725 --> 20:46.626
That you go back to Amy and try--

20:46.661 --> 20:48.628
really try to work this out.

20:48.663 --> 20:51.565
Because once it's official,
once it's in the system,

20:51.599 --> 20:54.534
you can't just decide to make it
unofficial and get it out of the system.

20:54.569 --> 20:57.304
And once the decision is made,

20:57.338 --> 20:59.306
one person's going to win,

20:59.340 --> 21:02.209
and the other loses,
even with a compromise.

21:02.243 --> 21:04.211
And that's how it's gonna feel--

21:04.245 --> 21:07.147
that one person has lost
and the other one has won.

21:07.181 --> 21:09.482
If you lose,

21:09.517 --> 21:11.585
you're gonna resent Amy.

21:11.619 --> 21:14.854
And if you win,
she's gonna resent you.

21:14.889 --> 21:17.057
I can only speak for myself.

21:17.091 --> 21:19.159
If I lose, I'll just
have to get over it.

21:19.193 --> 21:22.095
And if I win, I don't know
if I care if Amy resents me.

21:22.129 --> 21:25.432
I don't know if I care what
she thinks about me anymore.

21:25.466 --> 21:28.034
I only care about what John
thinks or what he will think.

21:28.069 --> 21:31.171
Talk to Amy, and then call me.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.776
Hi, Amy. Thanks for
agreeing to talk to me.

21:42.810 --> 21:44.744
But I kind of thought
you might bring John.

21:44.779 --> 21:46.746
Why? He doesn't get a vote in this.

21:46.781 --> 21:48.415
I make his decisions for him.

21:48.449 --> 21:51.484
I know that. And you've been making
good decisions for him all along.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.321
I don't need your approval
or your fake compliments.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.855
It wasn't fake,
and I wasn't finished.

21:55.890 --> 21:59.526
I think you've been making good
decisions for our son all along.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.761
But now I think you're making
a bad one, and you know it.

22:01.796 --> 22:04.497
Oh, is that right?
In whose opinion? In my opinion.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.266
Other people have
different opinions.

22:06.300 --> 22:09.669
Would you like to see?
Like to see what?

22:09.704 --> 22:11.871
Adrian and I recorded

22:11.906 --> 22:14.040
some people who would be
my character witnesses

22:14.075 --> 22:16.843
if you and I go to court.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.746
Let me guess. That would've
been Adrian's idea.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.815
Not just her idea.
It was my idea, too.

22:21.849 --> 22:23.750
Adrian's not your friend.

22:23.784 --> 22:25.752
Well, she's not your friend.

22:25.786 --> 22:28.688
It wasn't that long ago that you
wouldn't even let me see John

22:28.723 --> 22:30.357
because I was spending
time with Adrian,

22:30.391 --> 22:32.292
and you didn't want her near him.

22:32.326 --> 22:33.960
And you know that if
I were to call her up

22:33.994 --> 22:35.962
and tell her that I wanted to
get back together with her,

22:35.996 --> 22:38.465
she would turn around and be
my friend and not your friend.

22:38.499 --> 22:41.000
Whatever. She's my friend right now.
Here. Look at th.

22:41.035 --> 22:43.203
I don't wanna look at that.
I just wanna talk.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.638
Can we please just talk, Amy?

22:45.673 --> 22:47.841
<i>My name is Adrian Lee.</i>

22:47.875 --> 22:49.843
<i>I've known Ricky Underwood
for almost two years,</i>

22:49.877 --> 22:52.746
<i>and I've known Amy Juergens for
about the same time.</i>

22:52.780 --> 22:55.648
<i>Ricky is an unstable person.</i>

22:55.683 --> 23:00.353
<i>One day he's in love with you,
and then the next day he's not.</i>

23:00.388 --> 23:03.356
<i>I know, because we've been intimate
for almost two years.</i>

23:03.391 --> 23:07.527
<i>We've even been in therapy together,
but it didn't help.</i>

23:07.561 --> 23:09.596
<i>He has intimacy issues</i>

23:09.630 --> 23:11.731
<i>with me and with women in general</i>

23:11.766 --> 23:13.967
<i>and with anyone that
gets close to him.</i>

23:14.001 --> 23:16.136
<i>He recently disappeared for days</i>

23:16.170 --> 23:18.371
<i>without letting anyone
know where he was.</i>

23:18.406 --> 23:20.340
<i>He can't be trusted.</i>

23:20.374 --> 23:23.009
<i>Amy, on the other hand,
is solid as a rock.</i>

23:23.043 --> 23:24.677
<i>She's a good mother.</i>

23:24.712 --> 23:27.147
<i>She continued going to high school
after she got pregnant,</i>

23:27.181 --> 23:29.215
<i>and then continued after
the baby came.</i>

23:29.250 --> 23:31.451
<i>And she has a job after school.</i>

23:31.485 --> 23:33.653
<i>She has been the one to
take care of John</i>

23:33.687 --> 23:36.222
<i>every day of his life.</i>

23:36.257 --> 23:38.591
<i>She only has her son's best
interest at heart</i>

23:38.626 --> 23:40.760
<i>when she says she should
be the one to decide</i>

23:40.795 --> 23:42.729
<i>when and where Ricky
should see him.</i>

23:42.763 --> 23:44.664
<i>And she's my friend.</i>

23:44.698 --> 23:46.466
<i>We used to hate each other</i>

23:46.500 --> 23:48.468
<i>because I was Ricky's
girlfriend for a while,</i>

23:48.502 --> 23:50.403
<i>but after Ricky and I broke up,</i>

23:50.438 --> 23:52.472
<i>and Amy and I got to
know each other,</i>

23:52.506 --> 23:54.607
<i>we found out we have a
lot in common.</i>

23:54.642 --> 23:57.010
<i>And she's a good mother.</i>

23:57.044 --> 23:58.945
<i>Well, I already said that,</i>

23:58.979 --> 24:01.381
<i>but it's true.</i>

24:01.415 --> 24:03.750
Would you like to see more?
That's not gonna help you.

24:03.784 --> 24:05.819
Clearly, she's just
being vindictive.

24:05.853 --> 24:08.321
Well, Madison and Lauren
aren't being vindictive.

24:09.356 --> 24:10.924
<i>Hi. I'm Lauren.</i>

24:10.958 --> 24:13.893
<i>And I'm Madison. And we're
Amy's best friends.</i>

24:13.928 --> 24:17.063
<i>And we think that she should get
full custody of John.</i>

24:17.097 --> 24:19.966
<i>Yes. Although Ricky should
have visitation rights</i>

24:20.000 --> 24:21.901
<i>as dictated by Amy.</i>

24:21.936 --> 24:25.338
<i>Or you, Your Honor,
if you're watching this.</i>

24:25.372 --> 24:27.841
I can go on. Please don't.

24:29.376 --> 24:30.677
<i>I'm Jack Pappas.</i>

24:30.711 --> 24:32.879
<i>Uh, I'm friends with
Ricky and Amy.</i>

24:32.913 --> 24:35.348
<i>I like both of them,
but if one of them</i>

24:35.382 --> 24:37.584
<i>needs to make decisions for John,</i>

24:37.618 --> 24:40.153
<i>like where he's gonna
be every day,</i>

24:40.187 --> 24:43.990
<i>well, I guess it should
be his mother, Amy.</i>

24:46.060 --> 24:49.395
<i>It definitely should
be his mother.</i>

24:49.430 --> 24:52.565
I can go to my friends and get
them to do the same thing, Amy.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.867
Like Ben?

24:56.070 --> 24:58.271
<i>Hi. I'm Ben Boykewich,</i>

24:58.305 --> 25:00.340
<i>former boyfriend to Amy Juergens.</i>

25:00.374 --> 25:03.142
<i>I was her-- I was her
boyfriend at the time</i>

25:03.177 --> 25:06.846
<i>that John was born and for
many months afterwards.</i>

25:06.881 --> 25:10.316
<i>And I just wanna say that Amy
is a very good mother.</i>

25:10.351 --> 25:13.586
<i>Hi. I'm Grace Bowman.
I'm a Christian,</i>

25:13.621 --> 25:16.022
<i>and I got Amy a job working in
our church in the nursery</i>

25:16.056 --> 25:18.658
<i>so she could work and see her son
ever day after school.</i>

25:18.692 --> 25:20.894
<i>And she's doing a really good job,
from what I hear,</i>

25:20.928 --> 25:24.063
<i>and she's a really good mother.</i>

25:24.098 --> 25:26.165
<i>You're cute.
You're still recording.</i>

25:26.200 --> 25:27.166
<i>Oops.</i>

25:27.201 --> 25:29.302
I'm gonna edit that part.

25:29.336 --> 25:32.605
Yeah, you should,
if you're gonna use that.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.775
So you and Ben are speaking again?

25:35.809 --> 25:37.810
That's good, Amy. I'm glad.

25:37.845 --> 25:41.247
And I hope you let Ben
come around John, too,

25:41.282 --> 25:42.949
'cause John likes him.

25:42.983 --> 25:44.617
Yeah. He e-mailed me that.

25:44.652 --> 25:46.452
All of them did.

25:46.487 --> 25:49.589
You wanna know why?
'Cause they're my friends.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.860
And how would you know
that John likes Ben?

25:53.894 --> 25:56.195
Because I used to see him
with him at your house.

25:56.230 --> 25:57.931
Don't do this, okay?

25:57.965 --> 25:59.966
Just keep things the way they are.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.467
I don't want any changes.

26:01.502 --> 26:03.536
I do. That's why I'm asking you.

26:03.571 --> 26:05.872
Please let me have
John on the weekends.

26:05.906 --> 26:06.940
No.

26:06.974 --> 26:09.309
Why not, Amy? Just tell me why not.

26:09.343 --> 26:11.311
Let me hear your point
of view on all this.

26:11.345 --> 26:14.480
I wanna know why you don't want
me to have John 48 hours a week.

26:14.515 --> 26:16.449
Because I don't.

26:16.483 --> 26:19.786
Because he's mine. Because I
changed my whole life for him.

26:19.820 --> 26:22.021
I'm just asking for you
to let me change mine

26:22.056 --> 26:24.958
for the same reason,
Amy-- because I love John.

26:24.992 --> 26:27.727
No. I can't. I just-- I can't.

26:27.761 --> 26:31.464
I don't want to, and I don't
think I should have to.

26:31.498 --> 26:34.634
Why can't you just be satisfied
to see him when I let you see him?

26:34.668 --> 26:37.937
Because my being a father shouldn't
be limited to your whims.

26:37.972 --> 26:41.040
That's why. And if you want a fight,
you got one, you know that?

26:41.075 --> 26:44.077
I really resent your getting
people to make those videos,

26:44.111 --> 26:45.812
and I resent them doing that, too.

26:45.846 --> 26:48.414
Those are my friends, too.
At least Ben is.

26:48.449 --> 26:50.750
And Grace and Jack's okay.

26:50.784 --> 26:52.619
We shouldn't put our friends
in the middle of this.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.487
We shouldn't put our families
in the middle of this.

26:54.521 --> 26:56.356
Oh, yeah, is that what you think?

26:56.390 --> 26:58.691
Then why did our parents have
dinner together last night?

26:58.726 --> 27:01.694
Who asked them to do that? Not me.
I didn't ask them to do that.

27:01.729 --> 27:03.663
You invited my dad
over to your place.

27:03.697 --> 27:06.666
I did do that, and I
invited Adrian's dad over

27:06.700 --> 27:09.702
and talked to him which
is why I'm talking to you.

27:09.737 --> 27:12.872
Because he asked me to try
to talk to you one more time.

27:14.608 --> 27:16.576
Why is it such a big deal?

27:16.610 --> 27:20.380
Why is it so important that I
not take John on the weekends?

27:20.414 --> 27:23.616
I told you why I want him.
Why do you want him?

27:23.651 --> 27:26.052
Why do I want him?

27:26.086 --> 27:27.954
He's my baby. I love him.

27:30.424 --> 27:32.058
And...

27:34.795 --> 27:37.563
I don't want him to love you.

27:37.598 --> 27:40.400
Ah, there it is.

27:44.571 --> 27:46.572
So I guess we'll see
each other in court.

27:51.612 --> 27:53.579
I know I promised I would.

27:53.614 --> 27:56.249
But I'm sorry. I-- I can't.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.184
All right. If you can't, you can't.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.087
But why can't you?
What if the judge finds out?

28:01.121 --> 28:02.755
That you said you'd
have sex with me

28:02.790 --> 28:05.124
if I made a video
statement for Amy? Yeah.

28:05.159 --> 28:07.493
You really think a judge would
find out something like that?

28:07.528 --> 28:09.762
That he'd even care?
Isn't it illegal?

28:09.797 --> 28:13.032
Lauren said it's illegal for
me to offer you oral sex

28:13.067 --> 28:14.534
in exchange for your testimony.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.136
Even so, I'm sure it
happens all the time.

28:17.171 --> 28:19.138
especially in divorces
and custody hearings

28:19.173 --> 28:20.773
where friends are set
up against friends.

28:20.808 --> 28:24.177
But it's illegal. I don't wanna go
to jail for something like that.

28:24.211 --> 28:27.814
You're not gonna go to jail.
Juvie hall maybe, but not prison.

28:27.848 --> 28:29.949
Oh, God. Don't say that.

28:29.983 --> 28:31.984
My biggest fear in
life is going to jail.

28:32.019 --> 28:35.221
I won't press charges if
you do it with me now.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.290
Jack... I'm joking.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.125
I'm just joking around.

28:39.159 --> 28:41.761
No one's pressuring
anyone into having sex.

28:41.795 --> 28:43.763
I would've made that video anyway.

28:43.797 --> 28:45.732
I think you're gonna
have to make another one,

28:45.766 --> 28:48.401
just so it's clear that nothing
was offered in exchange.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.970
All right. Whatever
you want, Madison.

28:51.004 --> 28:53.740
Really? Really?

28:54.942 --> 28:58.244
Well, I might wanna have real sex.

28:58.278 --> 29:02.348
Maybe. After Betty
and Leo's wedding.

29:02.382 --> 29:03.883
Why then? I don't know.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.885
I mean, we'll be all dressed up,

29:05.919 --> 29:08.654
and I'm not gonna have
a curfew that night.

29:08.689 --> 29:11.224
I don't know. I was
just thinking, I guess.

29:11.258 --> 29:13.559
All right.
I like the way you think.

29:21.702 --> 29:24.137
So, I was thinking,

29:24.171 --> 29:26.506
maybe we should do it after
Leo and Betty's wedding.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.841
Okay.

29:28.876 --> 29:30.543
Do what?

29:30.577 --> 29:31.544
Have sex.

29:31.578 --> 29:34.781
Sex? Are we thinking
about having sex?

29:34.815 --> 29:35.948
We are.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.184
I didn't know. What do you think?

29:38.218 --> 29:42.455
Oh, I think it would
be slightly awkward

29:42.489 --> 29:45.725
since we haven't really
done a whole lot.

29:45.759 --> 29:47.126
It might be.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.995
Yeah.

29:49.029 --> 29:50.863
But...

29:50.898 --> 29:53.566
I guess that would be okay,
if you want.

29:54.768 --> 29:56.869
What made you suddenly
wanna have sex?

29:56.904 --> 29:59.172
Madison. She and
Jack are gonna do it.

29:59.206 --> 30:01.641
Shouldn't you and I decide
rather than you and Madison?

30:01.675 --> 30:02.842
All right.

30:03.877 --> 30:07.346
All right. I'll do it.

30:07.381 --> 30:08.915
Good.

30:16.757 --> 30:18.758
I just talked to Amy.

30:18.792 --> 30:21.527
Oh, good. How'd it go?
I saw the video.

30:21.562 --> 30:23.529
I can explain. Explain.

30:23.564 --> 30:25.698
Amy and Adrian asked some of us

30:25.732 --> 30:27.533
to record video
statements on her behalf.

30:27.568 --> 30:30.369
That's not an explanation.
You're right.

30:30.404 --> 30:33.472
The explanation is I was
over at Grace's house,

30:33.507 --> 30:35.441
and we weren't really
thinking right.

30:35.475 --> 30:38.444
You had sex with Grace? Oh, God, no.
We're just friends.

30:38.478 --> 30:40.746
Who weren't thinking right.
We made out a little.

30:40.781 --> 30:44.083
Don't have sex with Grace.
I'm not gonna have sex with Grace.

30:44.117 --> 30:46.686
Although she is a lot more
fun than I had thought.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.721
Fun enough to get you
to betray me on camera?

30:48.755 --> 30:51.891
I didn't betray you.
I just-- I didn't endorse you.

30:51.925 --> 30:55.228
I can make a video for you.
I can get everybody to maka video for you.

30:55.262 --> 30:57.230
Good, because I'm gonna need that,

30:57.264 --> 31:00.066
because the conversation
with Amy didn't go that well.

31:09.209 --> 31:11.544
What happened?

31:11.578 --> 31:13.713
He knows. Amy showed
him the videos.

31:13.747 --> 31:14.780
Ugh!

31:14.815 --> 31:16.115
Yeah, I know. Ugh.

31:16.149 --> 31:18.050
We're idiots. I know.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.552
And now we're gonna
have to fix this.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.320
We're gonna make a video
statement endorsing Ricky.

31:21.355 --> 31:22.822
All right.

31:22.856 --> 31:24.590
Do you wanna come over tonight?

31:24.625 --> 31:27.059
Really? You want me to
come over there tonight?

31:27.094 --> 31:28.327
Yeah. Do you want to?

31:28.362 --> 31:29.829
Do I want to?

31:29.863 --> 31:33.666
Oh. No cell phones at work!

31:34.968 --> 31:38.070
Don't have sex with Grace.

31:47.714 --> 31:49.682
Oh, hey. There you are.

31:49.716 --> 31:52.218
I didn't know you'd be in this
afternoon, so I came over.

31:52.252 --> 31:54.587
Thought I'd hang out a bit
and give Ben a ride home.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.589
Maybe grab some dinner.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.991
Only got a week left
as a single man.

31:59.026 --> 32:01.994
You excited about the wedding? Of course.
You're gonna be there, right?

32:02.029 --> 32:05.131
After all you've done for me, I wouldn't
miss it for anything, Mr. Boykewich.

32:05.165 --> 32:07.099
Good. Good. So, how'd it go?

32:07.134 --> 32:09.235
Not well. What are you gonna do?

32:09.269 --> 32:10.903
I'm gonna call Adrian's dad, Ruben,

32:10.938 --> 32:13.739
and ask him to go ahead and
set up some kind of mediation.

32:13.774 --> 32:15.308
You sure? I'm sure.

32:15.342 --> 32:17.910
And if it doesn't go your way?
Then it doesn't go my way.

32:17.945 --> 32:21.380
And then you're gonna take off again.
No, I'm gonna stay here.

32:21.415 --> 32:24.150
But I may have to punch Ben again.

32:25.886 --> 32:27.420
What did you do now?

32:27.454 --> 32:29.689
Nothing yet.

32:29.723 --> 32:30.957
What does she mean by that?

32:30.991 --> 32:33.626
That's another
conversation about Grace.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.629
Oh, boy. I can't keep up with you.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.164
What did you do to Ricky?

32:38.198 --> 32:40.099
You didn't get in the middle of
his business with Amy, did you?

32:40.133 --> 32:42.101
I told you to stay
out of that. Did you?

32:42.135 --> 32:43.636
I did. Did you stay out of it?

32:43.670 --> 32:45.838
No, but neither did a whole
bunch of other people.

32:45.872 --> 32:48.474
Ben, you and a whole bunch of other
people don't wanna be responsible

32:48.508 --> 32:51.477
for making a decision for a
one-year-old baby, do you?

32:51.511 --> 32:53.746
A decision that could affect
the rest of John's life

32:53.780 --> 32:55.881
and Amy's life and Ricky's life?

32:55.916 --> 32:58.250
I mean, what is wrong with you?
I'll tell you what's wrong with him.

32:58.285 --> 33:01.520
He's thinking about
having sex with Grace.

33:02.756 --> 33:04.623
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just friends.

33:04.658 --> 33:08.127
Yeah, well, sometimes friends
do some really stupid things.

33:10.163 --> 33:12.431
Griffin and I are friends,

33:12.466 --> 33:15.501
but I don't want to
be friends with you.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.003
Not just friends.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.538
Me, neither.

33:19.573 --> 33:21.574
What are you saying?

33:21.608 --> 33:24.744
I'm saying that I wanna make
my own decisions about sex.

33:24.778 --> 33:27.079
I don't want my parents
making those decisions for me.

33:34.459 --> 33:36.460
<i>I said it should be his mother,</i>

33:36.495 --> 33:39.664
<i>but maybe that's because I
didn't have a father.</i>

33:39.698 --> 33:43.267
<i>And since John has a father
as well as a mother,</i>

33:43.302 --> 33:46.904
<i>and since his father's been around
ever since he was born,</i>

33:46.938 --> 33:50.741
<i>then maybe his father should be in
on the decisions as well,</i>

33:50.776 --> 33:54.011
<i>and that would be Ricky Underwood.</i>

33:54.046 --> 33:56.280
<i>I'm making this video on
my own volition,</i>

33:56.315 --> 33:58.582
<i>and I have received no favors.</i>

33:58.617 --> 34:03.287
<i>I have to admit,
Ricky has come a long way.</i>

34:03.322 --> 34:06.524
<i>Yeah. No one thought he'd even come
around after John was born.</i>

34:06.558 --> 34:08.192
<i>I mean, I think he's a player,</i>

34:08.226 --> 34:09.860
<i>but, hey, that hasn't
gotten in the way</i>

34:09.895 --> 34:12.929
<i>of his being a father,
that I know of.</i>

34:12.964 --> 34:15.800
<i>They're both good parents-
Ricky and Amy.</i>

34:15.833 --> 34:18.536
<i>I mean, for teenagers. They spend
a lot of time with John.</i>

34:18.570 --> 34:20.971
<i>Yeah, I would never wanna spend that
much time with my parents.</i>

34:21.005 --> 34:24.542
<i>Me neither. But it's important, at John's
age, to have both parents around,</i>

34:24.576 --> 34:27.110
<i>and it's nice that they're fighting
over spending more time with him.</i>

34:27.145 --> 34:29.313
<i>Rather than fighting over not
spending time with him,</i>

34:29.348 --> 34:31.982
<i>and pushing him on the person.</i>

34:32.016 --> 34:35.085
<i>They don't do that. No.
They both love John.</i>

34:35.120 --> 34:38.222
<i>I'm generally considered an expert,
you know?</i>

34:38.255 --> 34:40.224
<i>And I get paid for my testimony,</i>

34:40.257 --> 34:43.159
<i>but, uh, this is-
this is just a mediation,</i>

34:43.195 --> 34:45.329
<i>so I'll waive my fee.</i>

34:45.364 --> 34:47.732
<i>Uh, well, everybody knows</i>

34:47.766 --> 34:49.667
<i>Amy's done a great- </i>

34:49.701 --> 34:52.235
<i>oh-- a great job with her son.</i>

34:52.270 --> 34:54.739
<i>And, uh, I mean, look at her.</i>

34:54.773 --> 34:58.342
<i>She's a mother,
and she looks like that.</i>

34:58.377 --> 35:01.879
<i>You know? I mean, come on.
She's hot.</i>

35:01.913 --> 35:04.448
<i>Where was I? Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

35:04.483 --> 35:06.250
<i>Uh, Ricky's not that bad either.</i>

35:06.284 --> 35:10.154
<i>I mean, you know, he should keep-
he should keep the son.</i>

35:10.188 --> 35:13.224
<i>I mean, just-
just for the weekends.</i>

35:13.258 --> 35:16.093
<i>And, hey, Amy, that makes available,
right?</i>

35:16.128 --> 35:19.430
<i>I think Ricky would be fine to
take John on weekends.</i>

35:19.464 --> 35:21.599
<i>I didn't realize it was
one or the other--</i>

35:21.633 --> 35:25.469
<i>that if we spoke up for Amy, then Ricky
wouldn't get to take John on weekends.</i>

35:25.504 --> 35:27.505
<i>And by the way,
Ricky has a job, too.</i>

35:27.539 --> 35:32.209
<i>He works after school, and he contributes
money whenever he can.</i>

35:32.244 --> 35:35.112
<i>He's trying really hard to
be a good father,</i>

35:35.147 --> 35:38.349
<i>just like Amy's trying really
hard to be a good mother.</i>

35:38.383 --> 35:40.818
<i>She is a good mother.</i>

35:40.852 --> 35:43.053
<i>I'm Amy's ex-boyfriend,
which isn't why I said</i>

35:43.088 --> 35:45.089
<i>all the nice things
about her before.</i>

35:45.123 --> 35:48.325
<i>I really think that she's a really
nice girl and a good mother,</i>

35:48.360 --> 35:51.796
<i>and I hope one day we can be
friends again, but...</i>

35:51.830 --> 35:54.465
<i>Here's the thing:
I work with Ricky.</i>

35:54.499 --> 35:56.400
<i>We both work at my dad's
butcher shop,</i>

35:56.435 --> 35:58.669
<i>and the two of us are friends.</i>

35:58.703 --> 36:01.906
<i>He's my friend. I may not have always
been the best friend to him,</i>

36:01.940 --> 36:04.408
<i>but we're friends.</i>

36:04.443 --> 36:07.044
<i>And he's a good dad.</i>

36:07.078 --> 36:08.979
<i>I mean that.</i>

36:09.014 --> 36:13.017
<i>Amy's a good mom,
but Ricky's also a good dad.</i>

36:13.051 --> 36:14.552
<i>Sorry, Amy.</i>

36:16.354 --> 36:17.855
Okay.

36:19.224 --> 36:21.358
Is that it?

36:21.393 --> 36:23.928
Are we not going to hear from...

36:23.962 --> 36:25.729
Adrian Lee, on your behalf?

36:25.764 --> 36:27.231
No, she's not speaking to me.

36:27.265 --> 36:29.733
Wasn't it her father who
got us all here today?

36:29.768 --> 36:30.835
Was it?

36:30.869 --> 36:31.869
Yes.

36:33.238 --> 36:35.005
I've heard from your parents.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.408
I've heard from your friends.
I've looked at your school records.

36:37.442 --> 36:40.211
Ricky, I wanna thank you for
volunteering your court records.

36:40.245 --> 36:42.379
By the way, I've duly noted
that you've been working

36:42.414 --> 36:44.215
on your issues in
therapy for some years.

36:44.249 --> 36:46.784
And, Amy, I wanna commend
you for staying in school

36:46.818 --> 36:50.521
and getting your grades back up to where
they were before the baby, while working.

36:50.555 --> 36:52.723
And oh, when you see your friends,

36:52.757 --> 36:55.593
please pass along to them
that it's unusual for friends

36:55.627 --> 36:57.695
to stick by teen
mothers and fathers,

36:57.729 --> 37:00.431
so they're also to be
commended for their support,

37:00.465 --> 37:01.932
as are the families.

37:01.967 --> 37:04.168
Nice to see the mothers
and fathers here today,

37:04.202 --> 37:07.204
and good to know you
both have family support.

37:07.239 --> 37:09.139
So, with that in mind,

37:09.174 --> 37:12.109
and being that both
parties have been unable

37:12.143 --> 37:14.044
to reach a compromise on their own,

37:14.079 --> 37:17.047
I'm ready to announce
my recommendation.

37:17.082 --> 37:18.883
Wait. For what?

37:18.917 --> 37:21.986
Jeez. Um...

37:22.020 --> 37:25.556
For me-- For me to
do the right thing.

37:27.125 --> 37:29.093
Please don't make a decision.

37:29.127 --> 37:31.195
Let me make a decision.

37:32.797 --> 37:34.965
I'm wrong, and he's right.

37:36.134 --> 37:39.169
Ricky should be able to
take John on the weekends.

37:40.272 --> 37:43.040
I, um-- I know that it's important

37:43.074 --> 37:45.509
for John to be around his dad,

37:45.544 --> 37:48.479
and I know that Ricky will be around
John for the rest of his life,

37:48.513 --> 37:50.814
and that he'll be a good dad,
because if he isn't,

37:50.849 --> 37:53.250
I will not hesitate to
stand up for my son.

37:53.285 --> 37:57.354
I also shouldn't stand
in the way of my son

37:57.389 --> 37:59.056
and his father.

38:02.761 --> 38:04.929
Thank you, Amy. Good decision.

38:04.963 --> 38:07.331
Very good decision.

38:07.365 --> 38:10.134
Of course, it's not
actually your decision.

38:10.168 --> 38:12.202
It's my decision.

38:12.237 --> 38:17.508
So, um, starting next weekend,
Ricky, you'll pick your son up

38:17.542 --> 38:20.411
at Amy's house before
bedtime on Friday night.

38:20.445 --> 38:25.049
And, Amy, you will pick John up at Ricky's
house before bedtime on Sunday evening.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.750
And I want you both

38:26.785 --> 38:30.521
to keep this arrangement
pleasant and civil.

38:31.856 --> 38:34.625
Hope I don't see you here again.

38:34.659 --> 38:36.627
So I get John for
his first birthday?

38:36.661 --> 38:38.996
His first birthday's next weekend.

38:39.030 --> 38:40.998
Next weekend? Yeah.

38:41.032 --> 38:43.300
Well, I guess that'll
be a good test

38:43.335 --> 38:45.736
of your pleasantness and civility.

38:52.978 --> 38:56.747
You did great, Amy.
That was the right thing to do.

38:56.781 --> 38:58.248
Was it?

38:58.283 --> 39:00.351
I don't get to have John
on his first birthday.

39:00.385 --> 39:02.419
Amy, you'll see John
on his birthday.

39:02.454 --> 39:04.421
You and Ricky plan a
birthday party together.

39:04.456 --> 39:06.690
Have everyone all together.
That's the way it should be anyway.

39:06.725 --> 39:09.093
Amy, Ricky got what he wanted here,

39:09.127 --> 39:11.328
so I think he'll be willing to
compromise with you on this.

39:11.363 --> 39:13.497
You'll work it out.
This is the beginning

39:13.531 --> 39:16.300
of working out lots of birthdays,
holidays and weekends.

39:16.334 --> 39:20.104
You both just need to continue doing
what the right thing is for John.

39:20.138 --> 39:22.106
I'm really proud of you.

39:22.140 --> 39:24.642
Me, too.

39:24.676 --> 39:27.978
Thank you for encouraging me to do
this and for supporting me in this.

39:28.013 --> 39:29.480
Of course.

39:29.514 --> 39:31.582
Just remember,
this is the easy part.

39:31.616 --> 39:34.618
The hard part's the next 18 years-
working things out.

39:34.653 --> 39:36.520
Well, 17 after next weekend.

39:36.554 --> 39:40.491
And you're going to invite Amy and her
family to the birthday party, right?

39:40.525 --> 39:42.926
And I would suggest
that you give it a park

39:42.961 --> 39:46.030
or some other neutral location
so you can always go back there

39:46.064 --> 39:48.966
in the years when his birthday
doesn't fall on the weekend.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.335
And remember,
Amy is going to treat you

39:51.369 --> 39:54.705
the way you treat her in
all of this, so be nice.

39:54.739 --> 39:55.806
I am nice.

39:57.242 --> 39:59.376
Well... Okay.

39:59.411 --> 40:01.478
We're gonna let the
two of you talk.

40:05.216 --> 40:07.618
So, is this how you want
you and me to end up--

40:07.652 --> 40:10.220
in a conference room discussing who
gets Robbie on holidays and weekends?

40:10.255 --> 40:12.089
George, I said I
would think about it.

40:12.123 --> 40:13.524
Let's just see how things go.

40:13.558 --> 40:15.526
And I said I don't wanna
just see how things go.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.028
I don't wanna wait. But we were
miserable when we were married.

40:18.063 --> 40:20.130
And we're not
miserable now, are we?

40:20.165 --> 40:22.533
I kind of am, yeah.
Well, you didn't seem too miserable

40:22.567 --> 40:24.668
until lately when the
subject of marriage came up.

40:24.703 --> 40:26.503
Let's just run off after
Leo and Betty's wedding.

40:26.538 --> 40:28.672
Just you and me and Amy
and Robbie and Ashley.

40:28.707 --> 40:30.674
We'll go to some Vegas
chapel and get married

40:30.709 --> 40:32.609
and just have the family there.

40:32.644 --> 40:35.379
What do you say? I say what I've
always said: I'll think about it.

40:35.413 --> 40:38.282
You got until Leo
and Betty's wedding.

40:44.889 --> 40:47.391
I'll see you outside, Amy.
Bye, Ricky.

40:47.425 --> 40:50.828
Oh, and if you and Amy want me to bake
the birthday cake, just let me know.

40:50.862 --> 40:52.796
I'd love to do it.

40:57.469 --> 40:59.269
What do you wanna do?

40:59.304 --> 41:01.605
We're in this together.

41:01.639 --> 41:03.574
Your mom can bake the
cake if you want,

41:03.608 --> 41:06.376
and you and I can plan
the party together.

41:06.411 --> 41:09.046
What do you say?

41:12.917 --> 41:14.718
Are they home yet? No.

41:14.753 --> 41:16.453
Have you heard from them? No.

41:16.488 --> 41:18.956
Rats!

41:18.990 --> 41:20.958
All right.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

41:20.992 --> 41:24.061
No, it's okay.
I'm happy you came over.

41:24.095 --> 41:26.096
I actually wanted to
ask you something.

41:26.131 --> 41:28.332
Sure. What?

41:31.836 --> 41:34.471
If a person wanted to
get birth control pills

41:34.506 --> 41:37.641
without their mother knowing they
were getting birth control pills,

41:37.675 --> 41:39.643
how would a person do that?

41:39.677 --> 41:42.780
And that person would be...

41:42.814 --> 41:44.148
you?

41:45.550 --> 41:47.117
You're how old?

41:47.152 --> 41:50.087
15. Same age as Amy
when she got pregnant.

41:50.121 --> 41:52.723
Oh, yeah. Well, then,
you can get birth control pills

41:52.757 --> 41:55.325
at the free clinic without
your mother knowing.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.995
But I suggest you ask your mother.

41:58.029 --> 42:01.565
I asked my mother. My mother took
me to get birth control pills.

42:01.599 --> 42:03.901
In fact, I just changed
birth control pills.

42:03.935 --> 42:05.903
With change, your body
has to get used to it6

42:05.937 --> 42:09.540
And, you know, you have to be
on the pill for at least a month

42:09.574 --> 42:12.876
before they... really get started.

42:14.078 --> 42:16.413
I hope that's why I'm late--

42:16.447 --> 42:18.382
that I changed pills.

42:20.018 --> 42:22.753
I mean, I always use condoms, too,

42:22.787 --> 42:26.223
but...condoms can break.

42:27.525 --> 42:30.527
I had a condom break just recently.

42:32.997 --> 42:34.965
Do you have a calendar?

42:34.999 --> 42:38.001
How recently? When was the
mother-daughter dance?

42:42.674 --> 42:49.676
