01:23.295 --> 01:24.145
How's he doing?

01:25.425 --> 01:26.975
He's having a good day today.

01:28.585 --> 01:30.643
Is the leakage cleared up?

01:30.645 --> 01:31.985
See for yourself.

01:43.165 --> 01:45.315
Looking better than yesterday.

03:59.235 --> 04:03.923
Don't think too much about Mr. Chrysler.

04:03.925 --> 04:06.313
It has been a long time since he

04:06.315 --> 04:09.265
has been anywhere near healthy.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.195
I don't
expect him to be healthy.

04:14.945 --> 04:17.195
I just wish he was a
little more substantial.

04:18.795 --> 04:20.815
You're really worried about him.

04:22.185 --> 04:23.535
I'm worried about us all.

04:27.775 --> 04:29.573
Now I think making saline water

04:29.575 --> 04:33.633
with table salt may be inferior

04:33.635 --> 04:35.295
to using actual ocean water.

04:40.345 --> 04:41.855
It says it's sea salt.

04:42.815 --> 04:43.805
Doesn't matter.

04:44.905 --> 04:47.385
We need to get some real
ocean water in here.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.993
How are we going to do that?

04:50.995 --> 04:51.895
I don't know yet

04:52.885 --> 04:54.035
but I'll figure it out.

04:55.855 --> 04:58.983
For now, just make sure
you're boiling the water

04:58.985 --> 05:00.843
before you salt it.

05:04.115 --> 05:05.673
204.

05:05.675 --> 05:08.715
I guess Mrs. Hedaker still
has some substance to her.

05:14.665 --> 05:16.065
Can you tell what she wants?

05:17.145 --> 05:18.295
I think she's hungry.

05:21.375 --> 05:23.085
Or she's wet herself again.

05:24.695 --> 05:25.845
There's no way to tell.

05:27.455 --> 05:30.295
We could feed her just in case.

05:34.135 --> 05:36.745
Hose her down before you leave.

06:25.005 --> 06:26.253
You care more about this puzzle

06:26.255 --> 06:28.555
than anyone else in here.

06:31.165 --> 06:33.365
I don't care about
this damn thing at all.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.995
I'm pretty sure
you're missing some pieces.

06:38.045 --> 06:40.545
Well clearly you care
enough for the both of us.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.755
You wanna get back to work,
make some science happen?

06:52.465 --> 06:54.495
I am puzzling!

08:58.785 --> 09:01.503
Sacks, this is not your room.

09:01.505 --> 09:03.055
You will come with me.

09:10.915 --> 09:14.035
Don't worry Ms. Treefish, he's gone now.

09:15.075 --> 09:20.075
You did the right thing.

10:11.129 --> 10:13.533
Dude, you should paint a
picture of an ugly building

10:13.535 --> 10:15.783
on to that actual ugly building.

10:15.785 --> 10:18.435
Yeah, or a really wide
one on to a really tall one.

10:19.514 --> 10:21.525
No, that wouldn't be funny.

10:24.745 --> 10:26.683
Why are you so into ghosts anyway?

10:26.685 --> 10:29.093
Because they're everywhere

10:29.095 --> 10:30.825
and nobody ever talks about them.

10:31.775 --> 10:33.103
Or to them.

10:33.105 --> 10:35.023
You can't talk to them

10:35.025 --> 10:36.925
or you could but they can't talk back.

10:38.275 --> 10:39.375
Like a pet.

10:40.255 --> 10:41.305
Sort of like a pet.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.875
I do have a pet ghost though.

10:46.085 --> 10:47.963
You have a pet ghost?

10:47.965 --> 10:50.535
Yep, since my turtle died.

10:54.653 --> 10:57.419
♪ Haircut, your turtle is dead ♪

10:57.421 --> 10:59.175
♪ And I'm sorry for your loss ♪

10:59.177 --> 11:04.177
♪ But you got a pet ghost instead ♪

11:04.897 --> 11:08.467
♪ Plus an army helmet or a coffee mug ♪

11:08.469 --> 11:12.023
♪ Or it could be a nightlight
full of lightning bugs ♪

11:12.025 --> 11:15.740
♪ Haircut, your turtle is dead ♪

11:15.742 --> 11:17.449
♪ And I'm sorry for your loss ♪

11:17.451 --> 11:21.618
♪ But you got a pet ghost instead ♪

11:22.791 --> 11:24.455
I like, I love what we do

11:25.465 --> 11:26.930
but I just wish I could make something

11:26.932 --> 11:29.453
that mom'd be proud of.

11:29.455 --> 11:30.286
I mean have you ever thought about

11:30.288 --> 11:31.969
transitioning to high art?

11:31.971 --> 11:34.393
No, I have to do
overall social messages.

11:34.395 --> 11:35.675
I love doing monsters.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.797
I mean what if you did
like a site specific thing?

11:42.795 --> 11:43.665
In a graveyard?

11:45.305 --> 11:46.505
Or a haunted building.

11:48.227 --> 11:51.100
I don't think that'll impress my mom.

11:51.102 --> 11:54.113
I'm gonna put you together
the best ever art show.

11:54.115 --> 11:56.493
That way, when the art world loves you

11:56.495 --> 11:58.783
your mom will love you.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.055
And they love haunted buildings?

12:01.235 --> 12:03.425
I know some art world
people who will be into it.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.443
Art world people are into cocaine.

12:07.445 --> 12:09.995
True, and wine and cheese.

12:13.615 --> 12:15.685
You know any places
that might be possessed?

12:17.185 --> 12:18.315
I got some leads.

14:01.365 --> 14:04.175
I hate washing the dishes.

14:06.195 --> 14:08.023
Is everyone locked?

14:08.025 --> 14:08.858
Not yet.

14:09.899 --> 14:11.982
You need linoleic acid.

14:13.236 --> 14:15.189
I'm worried about room eight.

14:15.191 --> 14:17.757
I already locked 206.

14:17.759 --> 14:19.842
You need linoleic acid.

14:28.353 --> 14:29.389
What?

14:29.391 --> 14:30.955
Are you sure that this is worth it?

14:31.965 --> 14:33.193
Worth what?

14:33.195 --> 14:34.443
Worth all the death.

14:34.445 --> 14:36.595
Worth whatever we're
doing to these people.

14:38.495 --> 14:40.023
It is worth that.

14:40.025 --> 14:42.133
It is worth that and more.

14:42.135 --> 14:44.733
It is worth nearly every
life on this planet

14:44.735 --> 14:46.155
to achieve immortality.

14:47.430 --> 14:49.013
What have these people
done that makes them

14:49.015 --> 14:51.373
worth more than immortality?

14:51.375 --> 14:54.943
You need linoleic acid.

14:54.945 --> 14:56.255
Turn off the old man.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.953
What will immortality...

15:01.955 --> 15:04.405
It will be mankind's
greatest achievement!

15:05.735 --> 15:07.685
It will be our gift to the future

15:09.005 --> 15:11.795
which we will be there
to admire in person.

15:14.175 --> 15:17.625
We will be there to say you're welcome.

15:23.565 --> 15:24.875
You already locked 206?

15:27.265 --> 15:28.098
Yes.

16:05.485 --> 16:09.085
Oh, Mr. Heron, are you thirsty?

19:17.450 --> 19:22.450
♪ Lost, forgotten ♪

19:24.039 --> 19:26.539
♪ In the mire ♪

19:49.735 --> 19:52.652
♪ Designed to fail ♪

20:01.259 --> 20:03.176
♪ Safe ♪

20:13.705 --> 20:18.705
♪ Lost, forgotten ♪

20:20.379 --> 20:22.879

21:04.014 --> 21:05.097
Good morning.

21:19.665 --> 21:22.085
Oh no, Mr. Sacks!

21:25.913 --> 21:27.735
You ruined your freshest kicks!

21:34.299 --> 21:35.132
Come on.

21:36.219 --> 21:37.302
Let's get up.

21:44.755 --> 21:45.588
Mr. Sacks!

21:48.225 --> 21:50.653
Do I have to deal with
this before I'm even dressed?

21:50.655 --> 21:53.593
Mr. Sacks ruined his freshest kicks!

21:53.595 --> 21:55.333
Well that is not surprising.

21:55.335 --> 21:57.613
He is a disgusting man of slime!

21:57.615 --> 21:58.935
Just fix it!

22:03.915 --> 22:04.748
Mr. Sacks.

22:05.856 --> 22:07.256
I'm not mad about the shoes.

22:10.135 --> 22:12.775
That's not your room, Mr. Sacks.

22:16.375 --> 22:17.717
Come on.

22:21.515 --> 22:22.555
Mr. Sacks!

22:23.695 --> 22:24.925
You are not amusing!

22:25.795 --> 22:28.015
And you're making entirely too much noise!

22:30.532 --> 22:31.365
Get up.

22:41.919 --> 22:45.303
He has no door which is
why I have tied him down.

22:45.305 --> 22:47.603
Do not untie him, do you understand?

22:47.605 --> 22:48.438
Yeah.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.493
Yeah!

22:51.495 --> 22:54.273
Let's pretend like this
morning was a normal morning

22:54.275 --> 22:56.323
and not a mess!

22:56.325 --> 22:57.855
And proceed with our day.

23:47.095 --> 23:48.645
My grandma lived here.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.063
Did she?

23:51.065 --> 23:52.775
Well, she died here.

23:53.610 --> 23:55.815
Dude, this place has
to be full of ghosts.

23:57.111 --> 23:58.263
It will be when I finish with it.

23:58.265 --> 24:01.153
We should probably come
back after dark though.

24:01.155 --> 24:01.988
Hold up.

24:07.801 --> 24:08.634
Hey.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.163
Tootles.

24:18.066 --> 24:18.899
Who was that?

24:19.765 --> 24:21.313
My girl Kish.

24:21.315 --> 24:24.083
Says she discovered the next big thing.

24:24.085 --> 24:26.985
Great, big thing art
is my favorite kind.

24:27.875 --> 24:28.975
A street artist.

24:30.005 --> 24:32.673
He's doing an installation of ghosts

24:32.675 --> 24:33.945
in a haunted building.

24:35.175 --> 24:37.315
Haunted by the ghosts of good taste?

24:38.685 --> 24:41.553
They're having a wine
and cheese opening.

24:41.555 --> 24:43.605
Well I always have an opening for wine.

25:00.565 --> 25:02.525
Reds are good, right?

25:03.585 --> 25:04.973
With cheese?

25:04.975 --> 25:06.695
I mean yeah, I think red
and cheese go together.

25:08.385 --> 25:11.043
What if we got other
than standard orange wine

25:11.045 --> 25:12.473
and canned cheese.

25:12.475 --> 25:14.433
That'll be a thing, right?

25:14.435 --> 25:16.513
Dude, I invited real people, okay?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.573
Not art school jerks.

25:17.575 --> 25:18.953
They don't wanna see your sarcastic take

25:18.955 --> 25:19.823
on the art world.

25:19.825 --> 25:21.523
They are the art world.

25:21.525 --> 25:22.925
And they want real cheese.

25:24.435 --> 25:25.685
To go with my real art.

25:26.724 --> 25:29.891
That's what we're telling 'em, yeah.

25:32.061 --> 25:33.393
Do we need more time?

25:33.395 --> 25:35.303
I mean tonight's too soon, right?

25:35.305 --> 25:36.513
Nah, I'm off, alright?

25:36.515 --> 25:38.653
I got the internet, grab your paintings.

25:38.655 --> 25:41.233
The art world rolls in at midnight.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.533
But I do have to paint
things inside the building.

25:43.535 --> 25:44.366
Okay dude, so what?

25:44.368 --> 25:45.971
You're fast.

25:45.973 --> 25:47.205
The sun sets soon enough.

25:48.623 --> 25:51.108
I don't know how we're
gonna pull this off.

25:51.110 --> 25:51.943
Yo.

25:53.272 --> 25:55.189
♪ Trix ♪

26:47.705 --> 26:50.085
No, it will shock me.

26:51.180 --> 26:53.097
Just try it.

27:05.272 --> 27:06.105
Idiot.

27:31.973 --> 27:32.890
Be careful.

27:51.478 --> 27:52.453
Interesting.

27:52.455 --> 27:53.455
What is it?

27:54.775 --> 27:55.865
Dirty mop water.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.093
Bits of dust, mud.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.963
I thought you said it glowed.

28:01.965 --> 28:05.163
That's just too small
a sample to see it.

28:05.165 --> 28:05.998
Watch this.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.205
Astonishing.

28:12.775 --> 28:13.875
Did it do something?

28:15.115 --> 28:15.948
Yes.

28:17.435 --> 28:19.945
It got your finger wet, dope.

28:25.065 --> 28:27.315
Is the water in the mop
bucket still glowing?

28:31.885 --> 28:32.718
It is.

28:33.765 --> 28:36.975
But I'm not sure that it's water.

28:51.475 --> 28:52.785
Stop!

28:52.787 --> 28:54.513
What the hell?

28:54.515 --> 28:56.625
Stop your quest for immortality.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.443
It is not for you.

29:00.445 --> 29:03.653
This is a demand, not a request.

29:03.655 --> 29:05.583
Pee into this jerk.

29:05.585 --> 29:08.803
You don't understand.

29:08.805 --> 29:09.985
I am a god.

29:12.355 --> 29:14.973
Each of us could be a god.

29:14.975 --> 29:16.743
We're using the genes

29:16.745 --> 29:20.893
from biologically immortal animals.

29:20.895 --> 29:22.255
Jellyfish, octopi...

29:24.795 --> 29:27.635
I'm no mere
bucket, no mere fluid.

29:28.825 --> 29:30.673
You may not be able to tell by sight

29:30.675 --> 29:33.923
but I am the queen of the seas.

29:33.925 --> 29:36.983
I have been since before
the land even was.

29:36.985 --> 29:40.355
For years, my kingdom was a peaceful one.

29:41.715 --> 29:44.335
A place where all could live in harmony.

29:45.675 --> 29:48.763
But there was a shark.

29:48.765 --> 29:51.723
A proud creature not unlike yourself.

29:51.725 --> 29:53.323
"I'm just an angry guy."

29:53.325 --> 29:55.583
He thought that there was glory to be had

29:55.585 --> 29:57.843
and that he was the one to have it.

29:57.845 --> 29:59.563
Plus I should be famous.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.993
He quietly made plans

30:00.995 --> 30:03.593
with his confederates to usurp my throne

30:03.595 --> 30:07.303
and when they were ready
they launched an assault.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.383
I of course was furious.

30:09.385 --> 30:10.216
Get out of my house!

30:10.218 --> 30:11.049
The shark brought with him

30:11.051 --> 30:13.543
the most ferocious creatures of the ocean.

30:13.545 --> 30:17.923
The swordfish, the eel, the urchin.

30:17.925 --> 30:21.363
It was the humbler animals
that stayed by my side.

30:21.365 --> 30:23.515
The jellyfish, the lobster.

30:25.535 --> 30:26.903
The whales remained neutral

30:26.905 --> 30:28.585
as they do in all things.

30:30.405 --> 30:31.995
"I'm just not a fighter."

30:35.125 --> 30:37.381
It was a difficult battle,

30:37.383 --> 30:39.493
hard fought on both sides.

30:39.495 --> 30:41.873
My face is for stabbing.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.175
With my guidance

30:44.785 --> 30:48.603
we prevailed and at the end

30:48.605 --> 30:51.243
I gave my allies the greatest gift

30:51.245 --> 30:54.485
a God could bestow, immortality.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.795
I gave it to them and only to them

31:00.205 --> 31:04.463
and that is why you can
not have immortality.

31:04.465 --> 31:06.083
It is not for you.

31:06.085 --> 31:07.443
I hope you understand.

31:07.445 --> 31:09.953
No, you don't understand, bucket!

31:09.955 --> 31:13.883
This fellow and I were
left here to die, to die!

31:13.885 --> 31:15.733
This whole building is full of people

31:15.735 --> 31:17.073
waiting to die!

31:17.075 --> 31:19.303
Well we're not gonna do that!

31:19.305 --> 31:20.425
Not anymore!

31:21.670 --> 31:24.345
We're using science to fix
that critical human glitch

31:24.347 --> 31:25.375
called death!

31:27.719 --> 31:28.763
I hate that guy!

31:28.765 --> 31:33.733
Well, she's not really asking
for anything unreasonable.

31:33.735 --> 31:35.693
She's asking us to die!

31:35.695 --> 31:37.153
And she's a brat.

31:37.155 --> 31:38.803
I won't do that for anyone

31:38.805 --> 31:41.495
much less a mop bucket god.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.725
Do you think it
can get out of the closet?

31:52.993 --> 31:55.525
I don't know but that's why I locked it.

31:56.555 --> 31:57.425
What's next?

31:58.690 --> 32:01.473
Maleic and hydride.

32:01.475 --> 32:02.525
Maleic and hydride.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.415
Why do you think Mr. Sacks
was banging on the door?

32:08.825 --> 32:10.419
The door of the mop closet?

32:10.421 --> 32:12.203
Yeah.

32:12.205 --> 32:14.503
We're all looking for our equals.

32:14.505 --> 32:16.405
They're both horrible fluid creatures.

32:19.275 --> 32:21.123
Did you find what you were looking for?

32:21.125 --> 32:21.958
Not sure.

32:23.475 --> 32:27.323
What is it you need to make
a god leave your mop bucket?

32:27.325 --> 32:28.753
Well.

32:28.755 --> 32:30.257
I guess I've never tried.

32:32.765 --> 32:33.598
Go check.

32:35.059 --> 32:36.573
Isn't this more important?

32:36.575 --> 32:40.113
Our job is to provide life.

32:40.115 --> 32:42.805
You need lithium lorate.

32:46.175 --> 32:47.065
304, Treefish.

33:02.155 --> 33:04.175
We haven't kept them all alive.

33:05.235 --> 33:08.273
To the best of our abilities.

33:08.275 --> 33:11.483
Go, see what Ms. Treefish needs.

33:11.485 --> 33:14.385
You need lithium lorate next.

33:28.365 --> 33:31.735
What is that you need, Ms. Treefish?

33:50.841 --> 33:55.315
You know I'm only here to
feed you and keep you well.

33:58.225 --> 34:00.015
Just like the other doctors were.

34:12.545 --> 34:14.395
I think she has a crush on me.

34:16.284 --> 34:18.193
You are not allowed
to have sexual relations

34:18.195 --> 34:19.853
with any one of our patients!

34:19.855 --> 34:22.322
I don't want to!

34:22.324 --> 34:23.965
That's a rule that can not be bent

34:23.967 --> 34:24.800
or broken for anyone!

34:45.625 --> 34:46.458
Let's do this!

34:55.755 --> 34:56.588
Hello again.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.013
Have you come to apologize?

35:00.015 --> 35:04.023
I've come to introduce you to science.

35:04.025 --> 35:05.733
Say hello to science.

35:05.735 --> 35:07.674
Hello science!

35:07.676 --> 35:08.509
Cute.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.045
I do not understand.

35:12.935 --> 35:13.965
Let me teach you.

35:27.685 --> 35:29.565
Why do you do this?

35:30.565 --> 35:32.415
I do this to send you back to hell!

35:33.425 --> 35:35.695
I'm not from hell, I'm from the ocean.

35:37.919 --> 35:39.793
Then I do this to send
you forward to hell.

35:39.795 --> 35:41.253
She did explain that she's...

35:41.255 --> 35:42.193
I don't care.

35:42.195 --> 35:43.505
Go get me another vial.

35:48.235 --> 35:50.332
What are we doing?

35:50.334 --> 35:52.293
I don't know!

35:52.295 --> 35:54.195
This is my first time murdering a god.

36:10.765 --> 36:13.893
Please, stop your quest for immortality

36:13.895 --> 36:15.283
and I will not have to continue...

36:15.285 --> 36:17.403
You grant immortality, right?

36:17.405 --> 36:18.955
You granted it to lobsters.

36:20.725 --> 36:22.723
Grant it to me alone and
I will cease my quest

36:22.725 --> 36:24.823
to give it to all of mankind.

36:24.825 --> 36:27.715
I will not
and you will not succeed.

36:33.345 --> 36:34.345
You're gonna know!

36:52.675 --> 36:53.508
Are you okay?

36:55.805 --> 36:57.105
I'm incredible.

36:58.565 --> 36:59.735
Can I help you up?

37:01.495 --> 37:03.045
I'm staying here for a while.

37:04.365 --> 37:07.715
Okay, should I do something with this?

37:12.515 --> 37:13.887
Read it!

37:52.055 --> 37:52.888
Wait here.

38:34.595 --> 38:36.903
Come on, dude, it's spooky in here.

38:36.905 --> 38:38.023
Are you sure
this is what we're doing?

38:38.025 --> 38:40.365
Yes, I'm sure this is what we're doing.

38:48.908 --> 38:50.193
Where do we start?

38:50.195 --> 38:51.235
Obvs, snacks.

39:22.553 --> 39:24.845
That god lightning really
takes a lot out of you.

39:27.695 --> 39:28.695
You gonna be okay?

39:30.545 --> 39:33.535
Yeah, as soon as I win.

39:36.312 --> 39:37.612
Did you take your pills?

39:38.795 --> 39:39.845
Get out of my room.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.168
Sleep well.

40:02.825 --> 40:04.483
Yo, I'm gonna go scope the sitch.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.123
I'll circle around and curate with you,

40:06.125 --> 40:07.888
let me know what's up.

40:07.890 --> 40:10.535
Cool, I'll just be here
in my own world of creation.

40:19.834 --> 40:20.751
Unlocked.

40:28.570 --> 40:29.403
Unlocked.

40:34.974 --> 40:35.807
Unlocked.

40:48.225 --> 40:49.058
Locked!

40:56.460 --> 40:57.293
But why?

41:04.920 --> 41:08.253
What are you trying to tell me, machine?

41:20.925 --> 41:21.758
Haircut!

41:23.783 --> 41:24.616
Haircut!

41:26.101 --> 41:27.267
Haircut!

41:27.269 --> 41:28.519
Yo.

41:32.225 --> 41:33.815
Maybe we should leave.

41:33.817 --> 41:35.165
I'm in the middle of painting.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.963
We'll make it part of the art.

41:38.965 --> 41:40.803
It is the art.

41:40.805 --> 41:44.245
No, the person thing.

41:45.565 --> 41:47.075
What person thing?

41:50.035 --> 41:52.233
Dude, this thing can't still be alive.

41:52.235 --> 41:54.023
This place has been shut down for months.

41:54.025 --> 41:54.858
It's horrible.

41:56.665 --> 41:58.685
Why is it beeping?

41:58.687 --> 41:59.923
I don't know, should we leave?

41:59.925 --> 42:01.193
Because of the beeping?

42:01.195 --> 42:02.675
Dude, because what is this?

42:03.595 --> 42:05.493
You don't think that'll
scare off the art people?

42:05.495 --> 42:07.458
I mean we could make
it a part of the art

42:07.460 --> 42:09.210
and we'll just act like we made it.

42:11.315 --> 42:13.065
I could paint some stuff in here.

42:14.395 --> 42:15.745
Some lumpy flesh things.

42:18.995 --> 42:19.828
Own it.

42:21.885 --> 42:22.718
Oh God.

42:23.965 --> 42:26.585
I guess that's what I'm doing.

42:28.025 --> 42:29.925
We're gonna make your mama love you.

43:02.635 --> 43:05.705
My morning walk I gladly take

43:06.795 --> 43:08.195
breathing in the summer air.

43:09.715 --> 43:12.095
The light is new, the weather fair.

43:14.315 --> 43:16.155
The creatures wish to see my face.

43:17.085 --> 43:19.603
My morning walk I gladly take.

43:19.605 --> 43:22.315
I dawdle now and then retrace.

43:23.895 --> 43:26.065
In afternoon, my walk is calm.

43:27.215 --> 43:29.643
The idle sun shows all the ground.

43:29.645 --> 43:33.023
The hillside scarred, broken bone.

43:33.025 --> 43:36.213
The breeze is careless on the shore.

43:36.215 --> 43:38.875
In afternoon, my walk is calm.

43:40.405 --> 43:42.725
I trust the paths I found before.

43:45.220 --> 43:47.795
The walk at eve I fear to tread.

43:49.295 --> 43:51.793
I know the day will soon be dark

43:51.795 --> 43:54.875
when moon rules night and owls hark.

43:56.035 --> 43:58.335
I fear the vastness of the plain

44:00.700 --> 44:02.150
a walk at eve I fear to tread

44:03.235 --> 44:07.165
for I know I shan't walk again.

44:25.375 --> 44:27.703
Yo, I'm taking a wine break.

44:27.705 --> 44:28.583
You want any?

44:28.585 --> 44:29.416
Nah dude.

44:29.418 --> 44:31.943
I'm high off spray paint and.

44:31.945 --> 44:33.745
Just like they tell you not to do.

44:43.635 --> 44:45.575
Cool, later.

45:12.553 --> 45:14.003
Aren't you a dream come true?

46:21.548 --> 46:25.548
You are the opposite of
a shriveled up dead guy.

46:34.225 --> 46:35.415
Haircut, be here now!

46:39.707 --> 46:40.540
Haircut!

46:43.766 --> 46:45.099
The hell you do!

47:03.777 --> 47:05.277
This is so stupid.

47:06.269 --> 47:07.602
We should leave.

47:11.148 --> 47:11.981
Cut!

47:13.303 --> 47:15.338
Cut, we should go!

47:15.340 --> 47:16.173
Haircut!

47:17.504 --> 47:19.337
Haircut, we should go!

47:20.665 --> 47:21.498
Cut, cut!

47:23.872 --> 47:26.455
Haircut, we should go, Haircut!

47:53.306 --> 47:54.223
Treefish.

47:55.177 --> 47:56.010
Brilliant.

48:18.692 --> 48:19.609
I got this.

48:31.055 --> 48:32.443
Hello Ms. Treefish.

48:32.445 --> 48:33.825
The lights are weird now.

48:35.285 --> 48:36.913
I suspect the electric company

48:36.915 --> 48:39.405
has finally shut us off.

48:43.635 --> 48:45.695
Did you do all this?

48:50.765 --> 48:52.425
Where did you get spray paint?

49:18.469 --> 49:19.919
any more of you!

49:29.575 --> 49:30.408
Who are you?

49:31.645 --> 49:33.773
You here for the art show?

49:33.775 --> 49:34.608
No.

49:36.025 --> 49:37.353
I work here.

49:37.355 --> 49:38.993
This place has been closed for months.

49:38.995 --> 49:40.613
Yes, I know.

49:40.615 --> 49:43.116
Then you know you don't work here.

49:43.118 --> 49:46.433
My colleague and I still work here.

49:46.435 --> 49:47.935
We still have patients.

49:49.055 --> 49:50.543
None of this makes sense.

49:50.545 --> 49:52.143
You broke my ribs!

49:52.145 --> 49:53.233
I'm sorry.

49:53.235 --> 49:54.068
All my ribs!

49:56.705 --> 49:57.538
Help me up.

50:06.095 --> 50:07.613
You better get out of here.

50:07.615 --> 50:10.193
Oh, I know, that's
what I was trying to do.

50:10.195 --> 50:11.493
You can leave the dead guy.

50:11.495 --> 50:12.895
I have a collection of them.

50:14.485 --> 50:18.583
I mean I don't collect them but they

50:18.585 --> 50:20.715
do tend to pile up around here.

50:21.957 --> 50:23.573
Dude, that could not be more upsetting

50:23.575 --> 50:25.495
to hear from you right now.

50:33.755 --> 50:34.883
Kish.

50:34.885 --> 50:36.153
Please don't be here.

50:36.155 --> 50:37.805
This place is so dismal.

50:38.915 --> 50:41.083
What is going on out here?

50:41.085 --> 50:42.583
I asked her to leave.

50:42.585 --> 50:45.403
So where's the artist?

50:45.405 --> 50:47.395
Or is he anonymous?

50:48.295 --> 50:49.455
Are those actors?

50:50.325 --> 50:52.623
What are you doing here?

50:52.625 --> 50:54.593
And why are we on emergency power?

50:54.595 --> 50:56.083
Look, we...

50:56.085 --> 50:58.853
Say better words!

50:58.855 --> 51:00.723
I'm going to steal her youth.

51:00.725 --> 51:01.825
Oh, there's a thing!

51:06.948 --> 51:08.505
Today is the worst day!

51:10.595 --> 51:12.195
This show is very complicated.

51:13.825 --> 51:16.375
We'd like to know more
about the artist's intent.

51:19.335 --> 51:20.185
Who's that guy?

51:24.638 --> 51:25.823
Are you acting?

51:25.825 --> 51:27.363
You think I'm not ready for you.

51:27.365 --> 51:30.303
I'm not ready for nothing!

51:30.305 --> 51:32.205
Nobodies not ready for nothing!

51:33.665 --> 51:34.498
Scramble!

51:46.865 --> 51:48.085
You all.

51:50.975 --> 51:51.875
Be careful.

52:13.305 --> 52:15.683
So how long have you been
planning this whole thing?

52:15.685 --> 52:16.773
This seems complex.

52:16.775 --> 52:17.606
Don't tell him.

52:17.608 --> 52:20.455
None of this, okay,
it's all just happening.

52:21.415 --> 52:23.515
This is redefining happenings.

52:26.111 --> 52:28.100
This is big.

52:28.102 --> 52:29.102
This is big.

52:47.425 --> 52:48.825
We can't take the hallway.

52:51.664 --> 52:52.764
We need a crawl space.

52:56.875 --> 52:58.075
Let's take the wall way.

52:59.295 --> 53:01.545
I solve it all, always.

53:07.565 --> 53:09.283
What do you think?

53:09.285 --> 53:11.375
Good light or bad light?

53:12.275 --> 53:13.108
Artistically?

53:15.175 --> 53:16.025
You don't know.

53:16.995 --> 53:18.493
Are you evil?

53:18.495 --> 53:20.253
Or just bright?

53:20.255 --> 53:21.575
We're not evil.

53:23.005 --> 53:26.795
And it's not really that
bright in here either.

53:28.525 --> 53:31.995
Do I know you already or are you new?

53:33.505 --> 53:35.805
Half and half, back
away from the hole, guy.

53:36.921 --> 53:39.345
Don't you ever use doors?

53:40.675 --> 53:43.435
Well, there's monsters
in the hallway thank you.

54:00.175 --> 54:04.533
Randolph, Mrs. Teeth,
meet Professor Grist.

54:04.535 --> 54:06.033
Grist?

54:06.035 --> 54:07.973
Oh, yeah.

54:07.975 --> 54:10.385
I'm not a professor, I'm a doctor.

54:11.235 --> 54:12.085
Doctor of what?

54:14.095 --> 54:14.928
Hello.

54:18.681 --> 54:19.512
What do you
know about the creature

54:19.514 --> 54:20.347
in the hallway?

54:24.235 --> 54:28.173
What are you, ghost
busters or something?

54:28.175 --> 54:32.605
We are not but ask me
again in about 30 minutes.

54:37.655 --> 54:41.273
I don't think it's
all that severe really.

54:41.275 --> 54:42.583
That lady shoots lightning.

54:42.585 --> 54:43.563
You saw that, right?

54:43.565 --> 54:48.033
She does but she also talks.

54:48.035 --> 54:51.055
Maybe we can just talk to her.

54:52.095 --> 54:53.603
I love that.

54:53.605 --> 54:56.065
You do that, that great plan.

54:57.075 --> 54:58.853
You come with me.

54:58.855 --> 55:00.423
Sure, why not?

55:00.425 --> 55:02.693
I mean let's all just die.

55:02.695 --> 55:03.528
Okay.

55:05.435 --> 55:06.418
Did you see that she shoots lightning?

55:06.420 --> 55:07.587
This is fun.

55:32.261 --> 55:33.092
This looks hard.

55:33.094 --> 55:33.927
Sh!

55:39.213 --> 55:40.046
Hello.

55:41.890 --> 55:45.673
I, I would like you to know

55:45.675 --> 55:48.783
that we have ceased all science activity

55:48.785 --> 55:52.135
in this facility and you're free to go.

55:53.825 --> 55:55.725
I am free to do as I please.

55:56.742 --> 55:59.545
Thank you so much for your visit.

56:00.875 --> 56:03.383
I have no reason not to destroy you

56:03.385 --> 56:05.103
as a precautionary measure.

56:05.105 --> 56:06.965
No, we're all good now.

56:08.615 --> 56:12.385
I do not care about good or evil.

56:13.875 --> 56:15.375
I am nature!

56:30.238 --> 56:32.025
I've never been to a better art opening.

56:45.806 --> 56:47.106
That's not what happens!

56:48.594 --> 56:50.677
You get up and you run!

57:05.245 --> 57:07.533
I'm pretty sure she won't check in here.

57:07.535 --> 57:09.423
She hates this closet.

57:09.425 --> 57:11.273
Your world is dark and strange.

57:11.275 --> 57:12.425
She killed Ms. Teeth.

57:13.485 --> 57:14.353
I know bud.

57:14.355 --> 57:15.705
We're gonna get her for it.

57:16.635 --> 57:18.643
I don't wanna get her for it.

57:18.645 --> 57:21.995
I want it to be yesterday
or this afternoon even.

57:23.655 --> 57:25.493
This is exactly the kind of thing

57:25.495 --> 57:27.783
we were trying to
circumvent with our science.

57:27.785 --> 57:29.413
What, horrible hallway monsters

57:29.415 --> 57:30.753
killing my friends with hand lightning?

57:30.755 --> 57:32.793
No, obviously not, that's very specific.

57:32.795 --> 57:33.815
Just death.

57:36.825 --> 57:38.755
Aquatic and weird.

57:39.665 --> 57:40.925
Aquatic and weird.

57:41.935 --> 57:43.145
I think we can do this.

57:46.945 --> 57:48.095
I think we can do this!

58:00.875 --> 58:02.965
I shouldn't
be doing this, you know.

58:09.255 --> 58:10.145
Smoking?

58:12.015 --> 58:12.848
No.

58:14.255 --> 58:19.255
Before you leave this room,
I'll be dead or immortal.

58:21.843 --> 58:22.993
So this doesn't matter.

58:26.055 --> 58:28.655
What I shouldn't be doing
is offering you this deal.

58:29.885 --> 58:32.385
You have nothing to offer
me but your own death.

58:34.015 --> 58:36.593
You gave your
warriors immortality.

58:36.595 --> 58:38.065
I want to do the same!

58:40.945 --> 58:42.225
I do not approve.

58:45.055 --> 58:46.575
You are powerful!

58:47.735 --> 58:49.935
The master of magic.

58:51.386 --> 58:54.285
I am the master of science.

59:00.881 --> 59:01.975
I am your equal!

59:06.102 --> 59:07.185
We are equal!

59:59.185 --> 01:00:01.705
Hey, face me, chum bucket!

01:00:10.545 --> 01:00:12.773
You have nothing, child!

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:16.321
Yeah, well I
have your name on my fist.

01:00:16.323 --> 01:00:18.558
♪ Shit head ♪

01:00:21.165 --> 01:00:23.965
How can I read them in the dark?

01:00:28.767 --> 01:00:31.975
Yeah, well then let
me get it lit for you.

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:04.618
Kish.

01:01:06.965 --> 01:01:07.798
Yeah?

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:11.105
I know how this ends.

01:01:12.218 --> 01:01:14.433
How does it end, bud?

01:01:14.435 --> 01:01:18.755
This ends like Jaws Three.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:22.955
How does Jaws Three end?

01:01:25.585 --> 01:01:28.695
Roughly the same as Jaws.

01:01:37.934 --> 01:01:38.767
Jaws?

01:01:46.015 --> 01:01:47.098
I got this.

01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.125
Jaws!

01:02:35.028 --> 01:02:35.861
You okay?

01:02:37.205 --> 01:02:38.585
All my friends are dead.

01:02:57.355 --> 01:02:59.155
I should put that fire out.

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.903
I'm gonna leave you here
next to this piano, bud,

01:03:04.905 --> 01:03:07.203
'cause I know how much you love 'em.

01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:09.203
Then I'm gonna get Haircut and Ms. Teeth

01:03:09.205 --> 01:03:11.663
and I'm gonna get you guys out of here.

01:03:11.665 --> 01:03:13.053
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:16.505
Someone emptied
the fire extinguisher.

01:03:17.825 --> 01:03:19.653
Strange twist.

01:03:19.655 --> 01:03:22.573
I don't think that I
have enough baking soda

01:03:22.575 --> 01:03:26.003
for a fire of that size.

01:03:26.005 --> 01:03:28.393
What am I supposed to do?

01:03:28.395 --> 01:03:30.625
Then maybe it just all burns down.

01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:36.465
This place has my
life's work in it, though.

01:03:37.985 --> 01:03:39.523
Monsters.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:41.085
Yeah, okay.

01:03:42.745 --> 01:03:44.973
Maybe we should get out of here.

01:03:44.975 --> 01:03:47.533
I'd like to get my
friends bodies first though.

01:03:47.535 --> 01:03:48.368
No!

01:03:49.495 --> 01:03:52.283
You will not go anywhere!

01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:54.145
You will die!

01:03:54.985 --> 01:03:57.703
We killed the monster, we're free!

01:03:57.705 --> 01:04:01.203
You did not,
because I am the monster.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:04.353
Please, can we just get out of here?

01:04:04.355 --> 01:04:05.823
Everyone is dead!

01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:07.953
Everyone is not dead

01:04:07.955 --> 01:04:10.265
until you are dead!

01:04:11.655 --> 01:04:13.345
Everyone.

01:04:14.895 --> 01:04:17.915
Don't worry, I got time for this.

01:04:32.448 --> 01:04:35.531
feeble!

01:04:40.516 --> 01:04:41.599
Power, power!

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:59.213
Come on, I'm making you safe.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.740
In here.

01:05:03.742 --> 01:05:05.075
Wait!

01:05:12.632 --> 01:05:14.465
Really being a jerk!

01:05:55.895 --> 01:05:57.585
I thought I was gonna
murder a god today.

01:05:58.993 --> 01:06:02.105
I suppose you think you might!

01:06:02.107 --> 01:06:03.234
I already did.

01:06:03.236 --> 01:06:04.243
I'm just trying to distract a chump

01:06:04.245 --> 01:06:05.615
before the fire takes us.

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:22.243
You're not that tough.

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:24.845
Your notes were pretty hard to read

01:06:26.018 --> 01:06:27.763
but I think I got 'em right.

01:06:27.765 --> 01:06:28.803
You're dead!

01:06:28.805 --> 01:06:31.415
Not yet but I'm ready.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.633
You've given up the cause.

01:06:34.635 --> 01:06:36.663
I'd rather be dead than a monster

01:06:36.665 --> 01:06:38.393
so I guess yeah.

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:39.663
You're weak.

01:06:39.665 --> 01:06:43.313
Please, take this, let it go.

01:06:43.315 --> 01:06:46.613
Die with me, die with dignity.

01:06:46.615 --> 01:06:48.733
We're never ready!

01:06:48.735 --> 01:06:50.725
This is how it ends!

01:06:54.667 --> 01:06:55.834
I am so tough!

01:07:31.075 --> 01:07:33.073
We leave now, that's what happens.

01:07:33.075 --> 01:07:33.908
Not me.

01:07:35.545 --> 01:07:39.573
Everything I know is dead or on fire.

01:07:39.575 --> 01:07:40.408
Me too.

01:07:41.545 --> 01:07:44.455
I was brought to this
building to wait for death.

01:07:45.935 --> 01:07:48.335
It's been more exciting
than it could have been.

01:07:49.235 --> 01:07:51.833
Okay, well we can transfer
you to another hospice.

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:55.383
Nah, I was in bad
shape when I went to bed.

01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:59.563
Since then, my ribs been
broken about three times.

01:07:59.565 --> 01:08:01.113
Sorry.

01:08:01.115 --> 01:08:01.948
No.

01:08:03.095 --> 01:08:06.625
It's just this is my time.

01:08:08.025 --> 01:08:12.015
Fighting it just turns you into...

01:08:15.905 --> 01:08:17.955
Do you want a blanket?

01:08:18.885 --> 01:08:20.455
No, I'm okay here.

01:08:21.475 --> 01:08:22.564
Pillow or anything?

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:24.875
Really, I'm okay.

01:08:26.095 --> 01:08:26.928
Okay.

01:08:40.795 --> 01:08:41.627
Hey.

01:08:42.895 --> 01:08:44.523
Yeah?

01:08:44.524 --> 01:08:47.325
Actually, if you don't
mind, a pillow would be nice.

01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:50.443
Of course.

01:08:50.444 --> 01:08:51.278
And my tea?

01:08:52.788 --> 01:08:55.122
Yeah, you got it.
