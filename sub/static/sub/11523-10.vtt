WEBVTT

00:07.716 --> 00:09.175
How are your hands so smooth?

00:10.343 --> 00:11.886
Just diet and exercise.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.180
You're not holding a mannequin hand.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.061
Hey, Ma.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.187
Um, nothing.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.148
Just hanging out with some guys from work.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.401
We're, uh, bowling.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.629
- Roll, roll, roll, roll, crash!
- Of course I'll be there tomorrow.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.071
Hey, Bobby, it's your bowling turn.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.992
No, I haven't seen Theresa's baby yet
because it hasn't been born, Ma.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.095
The owner of a Toyota Camry,
your lights are on.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.555
Actually, that's a very good excuse.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.955
Roll, roll, roll, roll, miss!

00:39.080 --> 00:40.457
All right. Love you too.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.252
What am I doing?

00:44.335 --> 00:46.337
Oh, no.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.922
You're not actually bowling.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.466
I just transported you...

00:49.549 --> 00:50.842
No, it's just...

00:50.925 --> 00:53.285
It was one thing when I was lying
to myself about being gay,

00:53.344 --> 00:54.888
but now that I'm officially gay...

00:54.971 --> 00:55.805
Did you register?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.729
You get 10% off
at all Halloween pop-up stores.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.243
Dude, I got to come out to my family,

00:59.267 --> 01:00.727
like, at dinner tomorrow.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.146
Are you saying we have
less than 24 hours to prepare?

01:03.229 --> 01:04.956
What does that mean?
What am I supposed to prepare?

01:04.980 --> 01:05.899
Everything!

01:05.982 --> 01:07.275
What will you wear?

01:07.358 --> 01:08.526
Do you have songs picked out?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.820
Have you finalized your scent profile?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.156
Why is everything so complicated
with us people?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.951
Decisions, decisions.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.328
Kimmy...

01:18.411 --> 01:21.873
which of these ties goes best with,
"How dare you? He's your son!"

01:21.956 --> 01:23.541
Um, they look the same.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.667
Are you insane?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.878
Burnt lilac. Amalfi Grimace.

01:26.961 --> 01:31.090
Kim Kim Kim, a play on Rin Tin Tin,

01:31.174 --> 01:33.593
I've been to many a coming-out.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.721
When Lance Bass came out, I was there...

01:36.805 --> 01:38.389
at the newsstand,

01:38.473 --> 01:40.225
staring at that <i>People </i> magazine

01:40.308 --> 01:42.936
until the guy asked me
if I was gonna buy it.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.104
Lance Bass?
No, I misheard that.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.440
But I've never actually been
a part of the drama.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.235
Tomorrow I get to play the role of...
gasp...

01:50.318 --> 01:52.779
secret boyfriend who prepared a song.

01:52.862 --> 01:56.157
I'll be like Jackie O. at JFK's funeral.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.841
Ain't nobody looking at that wooden box.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.286
Titus, there was an Italian family
in Durnsville,

02:00.370 --> 02:01.788
and they were pretty old-fashioned.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.475
They pulled their daughter out of school
because she kissed a girl,

02:04.499 --> 02:06.459
even though it was just a CPR dummy.

02:06.543 --> 02:10.088
I kind of wonder how Mikey's family
is gonna react to all this.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.341
Oh, I know. Can you imagine the drama?

02:14.634 --> 02:17.011
Titus. Titus, we got to do something.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.764
I know I talk a big game
about gentrification,

02:19.848 --> 02:21.641
but now it's time for action.

02:21.724 --> 02:24.018
Those sons of bitches opened a bakery.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.147
Some puppies opened a bakery
and we're mad about it?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.357
Sorry, Lillian, but I can't help you.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.277
Mikey's coming out,
and I have so much to do to get ready.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.945
Okay, but you're missing out, T.

02:34.028 --> 02:37.073
I'm gonna take this place down old-school,

02:37.157 --> 02:40.243
like back in the '70s
when this city was a city.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.996
When we were giving Mayor Lindsay hell

02:43.079 --> 02:46.875
and Mayor Lindsay was giving
Florence Henderson crabs

02:46.958 --> 02:51.754
and the Crabs were a street gang
that threw live crabs at people.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.798
Is any of this real, Lillian?

02:53.882 --> 02:54.882
Maybe.

02:55.925 --> 02:56.843
What about you, Princess?

02:56.926 --> 02:58.595
You want to do something important today,

02:58.678 --> 03:01.389
or are you gonna go do cartwheels
and make friends with a bee?

03:01.472 --> 03:04.684
I'd love to,
but it's a really big day for me.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.087
- I'm starting...
- Bored.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.562
Tell us in charades.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.250
- Oh, oh, Pac-Man.
- Talking. Titus.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.693
- Uh, Ms. Pac-Man.
- Titus is talking.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.776
- Baby Pac-Man.
- Okay, we know it starts with a T.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.090
The Pac-Mans stop having sex
and go to couples counseling.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.116
Tangerine. Thyroid.
Two turtledoves.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.409
Therapy.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.828
You're starting therapy today!

03:26.247 --> 03:27.081
So take a good look.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.877
The next time you see me,
I'll be totally normal.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.420
Up high.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.047
No?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.887
The only therapy I ever had
was a Christian summer camp

03:40.970 --> 03:42.530
that tried to make boys less "musical."

03:42.597 --> 03:43.431
Ooh.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.351
<i>♪ It was a total bangfest ♪</i>

03:54.442 --> 03:55.693
<i>♪ Unbreakable ♪</i>

03:59.113 --> 04:00.114

04:11.584 --> 04:14.420

04:14.504 --> 04:15.504
<i>♪ Damn it ♪</i>

04:17.714 --> 04:20.677
- So how are you doing?
- Great.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.679
I'm gonna tear therapy a new one.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.847
And then therapy will be like,
"Thanks, Kimmy.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.308
Now I've got two."

04:27.392 --> 04:28.893
What'd you do to your leg?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.771
Well, who knows, really?

04:31.854 --> 04:33.439
As Beyoncé would say,

04:33.523 --> 04:35.275
"I woke up like dis."

04:35.358 --> 04:37.568
So I'm doing great.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.028
You are doing great.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.780
You're a doctor with double-pierced ears.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.031
How cool is that?

04:42.115 --> 04:42.991
No, I don't have double...

04:44.492 --> 04:46.619
Okay, let's talk about you.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.454
Why are you here, Kimmy?

04:48.538 --> 04:51.082
Well, let's start from the beginning.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.171
So the ghost was just a guy
surfing at night?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.132
Thumbs down.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.175
Won't be reading that one again.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.468
Ooh.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.013
Ugh! Dang shoe!

05:11.644 --> 05:12.854
Excuse me, miss.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.898
Can you tell me how to get
to the nursing college?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.984
No, I can't, stranger.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.987
- But I can show you.
- Ooh.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.162 --> 05:31.122
Were you alone a lot as a child?

05:31.205 --> 05:33.333
Oh, um, I guess.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.418
Did you grow up in a two-parent household?

05:35.501 --> 05:39.338
I'm sorry. Why are we talking about stuff
from before I was kidnapped?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.257
I'm here to talk about the bunker.

05:41.340 --> 05:46.220
My prom date was a guy made out of cans
who went home with a different girl.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.764
Kimmy, therapy isn't a quick fix.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.599
It takes time.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.143
And the bunker is not
the only thing that defines you.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.061
I know that.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.395
I just want to go fast.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.064
Straight to the breakthrough part.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.400
So if you need to know
about my whole life, I'll do it.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.586
Like the Micro Machines guy.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.904
My parents met while my mom
was a beauty technician

06:02.987 --> 06:04.173
and my dad came in to get a perm.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.674
They did it once in the bathroom
of a Ruby Tuesdays,

06:05.698 --> 06:06.925
where he said,
"This must be Booby Tuesdays."

06:06.949 --> 06:08.802
I don't really know him, but his
name starts with an S or a 5.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.387
I was born on a roller coaster
during a tornado alert...

06:10.411 --> 06:11.537
Wait. What?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.581
What do we want?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.917
When do we want it?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.502
Hey there.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.021
We thought you might want a little snack.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.838
It's our take on a Pop-Tart.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.342
But because both those words are gendered,
we call it a j'shnerp.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.344
But I am protesting you.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.012
Oh, you are just the cutest.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.722
Cutest?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.850
I was breaking into the Fed naked

06:32.934 --> 06:35.686
with "OPEC" written on me in pig's blood

06:35.770 --> 06:38.940
before you were even a twinkle
in the eye of the dog

06:39.023 --> 06:41.025
that mounted your mom.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.153
Write that down before it's lost forever.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.071
What?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.614
Girlie, you must have me confused

06:46.697 --> 06:50.284
with someone who doesn't have
a throwing crab in her pocket.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.163
You should be scared of me!

06:54.247 --> 06:58.000
Everything I own,
I looted in the '77 blackout!

06:58.084 --> 06:59.836
And when I needed new shoes,

06:59.919 --> 07:03.089
I caused the 2003 blackout.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.470
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna lie to you.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.931
But his name is Lance.
What's gay about that?

07:12.014 --> 07:15.560
Actually, Kimmy, you should know,
Lance is a super-gay name.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.645
Well, that's our time.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.729
Wait. We're done?

07:18.813 --> 07:19.981
No, nothing happened.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.607
I told you this is a process.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.277
Frasier Crane would fix people's problems
in one phone call.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.338
Then he'd throw a dinner party
for the Seattle Opera

07:26.362 --> 07:28.823
and be all, "Good God, Niles!"

07:28.906 --> 07:31.367
- Look, you can't force a breakthrough.
- So what?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.636
I'm just gonna keep coming here

07:32.660 --> 07:34.555
and talking forever
and never accomplishing anything

07:34.579 --> 07:36.247
like those clowns in Congress?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.874
God, being in Congress must be fun.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.626
Okay, your need for validation
is understandable.

07:40.710 --> 07:45.214
Some of my clients get these
after every session.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.468
Stickers?

07:48.551 --> 07:51.679
"You're a superstar," says a star, sure...

07:51.762 --> 07:53.139
And it's wearing a cape?

07:53.222 --> 07:55.892
Every time we talk, you get
a little reminder of your progress.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.602
So one sticker a session?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.562
Or do I get more stickers
based on what I say?

07:59.645 --> 08:01.689
'Cause that's a better system.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.167
Not telling you how to do your job.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.609
You're the sticker doctor.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.902
Today you get three:

08:05.985 --> 08:08.571
one for coming in,

08:08.654 --> 08:10.490
one for doing some really good work,

08:10.573 --> 08:12.492
and one for coming back tomorrow.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.205
Thanks, Andrea.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.373
Maybe that smiling purple ball is right.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.167
I am grape at this.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.587
Okay, that's funny.

08:29.050 --> 08:33.304
...burning in hell
with the rest of the Yankees, Lord.

08:33.386 --> 08:34.222
Amen.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.515
Amen.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.561
- What did I just serve myself?
- It's veal face.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.897
Don't embarrass me.
I got enough going on.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.319
Dude, I'm sorry,
but I'm freaking out a little.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.154
I feel sick to my stomach.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.865
It's just, I don't want to upset my dad.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.617
He's an emotional guy.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.746
Last family fight, he got up
and drove to the cemetery

08:58.829 --> 09:01.082
to go stand in his mausoleum.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.459
And my brother Dom, Jr.,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.086
he won't understand.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.087
He's a real guy's guy.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.005
That's why he's at the gym all the time

09:08.089 --> 09:10.550
with his roommate, Lance.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.636
And then there's my Pupazza.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.139
Is that a person?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.724
If it is, this could kill her.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.479
I hate lying to my family,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.106
but I don't know if I can do this.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.649
Of course you can.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.484
And I'm right here beside you.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.652
Come on, how bad can it be?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.195
Mikey's not eating.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.948
What's wrong with you?
You don't want to be a little fat anymore?

09:34.031 --> 09:35.408
No, I'm just...

09:35.491 --> 09:36.534
I'll eat later.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.745
Michael Michael Politano,

09:39.829 --> 09:42.206
did you eat before you got here?

09:42.290 --> 09:44.250
No, I'm just not hungry.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.501
There is no God.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.713
O Lucifer, receive your servant!

09:48.796 --> 09:50.798
And this is just about food.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.758
You see what you're doing to your mother?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.428
I have half a mind
to go mausoleum right now!

09:55.511 --> 09:57.013
Satan, fill me with your seed!

09:57.096 --> 09:58.931
May Pupazza visit you
in your dreams, Michael.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.516
No, I'm just gay. Okay?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
I'm gay.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.316
I'm nervous.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.527
'Cause I didn't know how to tell you guys.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.239
Titus isn't my fireman's doctor.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.616
That was a lie.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.244
He's my boyfriend.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.788
That's it.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.674
In the words of Sara Bareilles...

10:33.758 --> 10:35.509
Michael...

10:35.593 --> 10:39.221
do you know what the church says
about homosexuality?

10:40.139 --> 10:41.849
Hmm?

10:42.850 --> 10:44.935
'Cause I don't anymore.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.481
Our gay pope seems to be for it.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.900
So who am I to go against our gay pope?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.111
And supposedly one in ten is gay,

10:54.195 --> 10:58.074
so one of our kids had to be.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.911
Sure wasn't going to be Dominic, Jr.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.789
Not unless touching boobs makes you gay!

11:08.084 --> 11:11.212
Love makes everyone equal!

11:12.505 --> 11:13.381
It's sad.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.549
Her mind is gone.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.097
Michael, look, you know
I don't do big speeches.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.016
Come here.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.186
Thanks, Dad.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.605
<i>Salute!</i>

11:31.190 --> 11:32.983
I blame Ellen DeGeneres for this.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.661
Those stickers are great, huh?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.079
What's that?

11:45.162 --> 11:46.914
A pepper saying, "Hot stuff"?

11:46.997 --> 11:49.166
Not bad. Not bad.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.961
Yes. Dylan loves the stickers.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.839
So does Kimmy.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.426
Well, they do help motivate him
not to wet the bed.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.679
Oh, Kimmy doesn't have that problem.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.681
But she doesn't look down on Dylan.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.267
So how old's your child?

12:06.350 --> 12:07.726
Kimmy's what?

12:09.728 --> 12:11.313
I'm ready to go, Dad.

12:11.397 --> 12:15.359
Dr. Bayden said I'd get another sticker
if I'm polite when I meet new people...

12:15.443 --> 12:16.444
like this bitch.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.988
- Ow!
- Oh, s-so sorry.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.824
These stickers are for kids.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.242
You lied to me, Doctor.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.202
If that even is your real name.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.664
The stickers are just a tool
for positive reinforcement.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.958
And, yes, generally,
they are for younger people,

12:31.041 --> 12:33.210
but so are wheelie-sneakers.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.295
Oh!

12:34.378 --> 12:35.504
I'm fine. Don't help me.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.006
You know what?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.549
You were just tricking me.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.843
You wanted me to leave,
so you gave me some stickers.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.511
You think that makes me feel grape?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.805
No. It makes me berry sad.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.284
'Cause you know who else
used to mess with my head like that?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.517
The Reverend!

12:48.601 --> 12:49.810
Kimmy, I am berry sorry...

12:49.894 --> 12:51.395
Excuse me. Very.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.857
You have every raisin...
Oh, come on, Banandrea.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.360
This sucks eggs! I'm so mad!

13:11.790 --> 13:13.250
Sorry about the turbulence.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.920
A moment ago, you were quite upset.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.713
And I apologized.

13:17.796 --> 13:21.258
Can we just get back to you telling me
all my childhood crushes are gay?

13:21.342 --> 13:24.094
Who's next, Ricky Martin and Niles?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.221
Wow. Okay.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.431
Actually, I would like to talk

13:27.515 --> 13:30.267
about how you control
your temper like that.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.351
Okay.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.230
Well, when I was little, I was obsessed
with Disney princesses.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.274
Belle, Ariel, Tan Sally Dress-Up...

13:37.358 --> 13:39.443
That's what they called Pocahontas
in Indiana.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.361
Mm.

13:40.444 --> 13:44.031
But then, in the bunker,
I realized I was a Disney princess.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.408
I was held prisoner by a beast,
like Belle.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.744
I had to keep my mouth shut, like Ariel.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.705
Yes, those movies are problematic.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.249
You probably haven't seen <i>Tangled,</i>

13:53.332 --> 13:55.185
but at the end when they cut
Rapunzel's hair off,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.545
it turns brown and "loses its magic."

13:57.628 --> 13:58.879
What is that about?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.339
But they all had happy endings.

14:00.422 --> 14:04.760
So whenever my noodle got steamed,
I just took a trip to my happy place.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.100

14:11.183 --> 14:13.269

15:12.995 --> 15:14.914
Oh, thank you, Fairy Godmother.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.165
Sure, dude.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.752
Kimmy, having a coping mechanism
is perfectly healthy,

15:19.835 --> 15:23.672
but you do know that it's okay
to get mad, right?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.132
Of course.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.216
Not!

15:26.300 --> 15:27.509
<i>Wayne's World.</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:30.262
Anger is a normal response
to a lot of things.

15:30.346 --> 15:34.725
For example, getting a 50th birthday card
from your niece when you're 44.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.227
I mean, who paid for that?
She's seven!

15:37.311 --> 15:39.063
No. Anger is bad and ugly.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.981
It's the opposite of who I want to be.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.858
So I don't get pissed off.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.568
I get pissed on.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.570
Hmm.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.239
Look, between now and our next session,

15:49.323 --> 15:52.743
I want you to allow yourself to be angry.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.497
You are entitled to that emotion.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.669
And if you do,
you can have any sticker you want.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.147
Fine. If I have to, the astronaut one
that says, "You're out of this world."

16:04.171 --> 16:05.589
I don't care.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.805
What are you doing?

16:12.888 --> 16:14.348
You're not supposed to eat those.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.831
They're biscotti. They're terrible.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.309
I don't care.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.356
Am... Am I missing something here?

16:22.439 --> 16:24.024
'Cause that went great, right?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.651
It was great for you.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.279
Not so great for me
or my planned butterfly release.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.159
Oh, my God.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.287
Are you mad that you didn't get
to be the center of attention at this?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.540
I wrote a song that rhymed
"tolerance" with...

16:39.623 --> 16:41.434
No, you know what?
I'm not even gonna tell you now.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.128
- Wow, Titus.
- That's exactly what they would have said!

16:44.211 --> 16:45.647
But I never got to have that moment.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.381
Not today, not ever!

16:47.464 --> 16:49.091
Homo says what?

16:49.174 --> 16:51.719
I never got to come out, Mikey.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.303
That speech I was gonna give today?

16:53.387 --> 16:55.389
I've been writing it in my head
for 20 years.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.641
I was just gonna replace "Titus"
with "Mikey,"

16:57.725 --> 16:58.976
"Mississippi" with "Queens,"

16:59.059 --> 17:00.769
and <i> "Miss Saigon"</i>
with "the New York Jets."

17:00.853 --> 17:02.730
Go, Jets.

17:03.689 --> 17:07.443
Growing up in Mississippi,
coming out wasn't a thing.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.112
You were just... funny.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.949
And then you marry a Vonda.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.535
In Queens, they're called Ginas.

17:16.617 --> 17:19.704
I never got the drama,
the hugs, the tears,

17:19.788 --> 17:22.142
and, more importantly,
I never got to stare bigotry in the eye

17:22.165 --> 17:24.752
and say, "Homey don't play that."

17:25.586 --> 17:27.003
I said it's been 20 years.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.550
I'm happy for you, Mikey.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.554
But the world weeps for Titus.

17:38.140 --> 17:42.144
I need to take a somber, reflective walk.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.571
Hey, Lillian.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.822
Let me help you with those.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.407
I don't need your help.

17:55.491 --> 17:59.453
What do you think,
I can't carry my own brown-bag porno?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.288
Ah!

18:03.624 --> 18:07.836
Oh, what are you looking at,
Strawberry Shortbus?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.421
Lillian, how do you do it?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.715
Standing up is the only way I can.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.926
When you're upset,
you just let it all out.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.177
I don't know how to do that.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.013
It doesn't matter if you let it all out

18:18.097 --> 18:20.516
if nobody takes you seriously.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.102
Well, my therapist wants me
to be mad more.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.311
- She thinks...
- She?

18:24.394 --> 18:26.271
Oh, brother.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.817
She thinks that I'm entitled
to that emotion or whatever.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.152
So maybe you can teach me?

18:32.236 --> 18:34.363
Okay.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.241
Yeah.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.701
That's what I need!

18:39.785 --> 18:41.370
Get back out there!

18:41.453 --> 18:42.788
Ha!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.792
I'll show you.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.001
Oh, these bastards.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.920
Come on. Follow my lead.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.005
Can I ask you guys to wait a moment?
We're filming.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.340
Yeah, I'm walking.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.843
I'll smack you in the mouth.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.010
Oh, my God!

18:57.094 --> 18:59.388
Will you be the crazy grandma
in my web series?

18:59.471 --> 19:01.557
- What...
- That's Richard Belzer.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.684
Mr. Belzer! Mr. Belzer!

19:03.767 --> 19:06.145
It's Kimmy from watching you!

19:07.062 --> 19:08.480
Mr. Belzer!

19:11.859 --> 19:12.985
Watch this.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.279
Oh, no! Oh, don't worry.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.574
I'll pick that up 'cause I work for you!

19:18.657 --> 19:19.700
Ah!

19:23.412 --> 19:24.830
Wait. Where'd that come from?

19:24.913 --> 19:26.039
You never picked it up.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.709
What the hell is happening?

19:30.669 --> 19:34.882
If we can't find a way to get into a fight
in a New York City deli,

19:34.965 --> 19:36.425
then Al Sharpton was right.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.219
I'm an embarrassment to honkydom.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.738
But what's there to get mad about in here?

19:40.762 --> 19:43.098
They got candy and giant beer bottles...

19:43.182 --> 19:45.684
...that make me feel like I'm shrinking.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.020
"What's there to get mad about?"

19:48.103 --> 19:52.024
How about this hotshot
on a very important phone call?

19:52.107 --> 19:55.360
Mommy, I tried, but it was hot,
and I didn't have the things.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.113
Mommy! Turn down the TV.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.698
What are you watching?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.241
No, don't! I'm taping it!

20:01.325 --> 20:02.343
Eh!

20:02.367 --> 20:04.870
And I'm cutting the line.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.957
You go ahead, honey.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.794
You people are useless.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.047
And I don't know what your problem is.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.341
I thought you wanted to get angry.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.260
I guess this kind of stuff
just isn't what makes me mad.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.428
Oh, forget it.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.847
I can't deal with you.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.349
You're on your own.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.601
You're on your own. You're on your own.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.353
You're on your own, you bitch!

20:29.436 --> 20:31.188
I'll kill you!

20:31.271 --> 20:33.857
Aah!

20:33.941 --> 20:36.902
Aah! Aah!

20:37.945 --> 20:40.322
I'll eat your heart!

20:42.115 --> 20:43.992
Aah!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.827
Mwah.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.583
Dude, there you are.
We got to get going.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.686
- You'll hit airport traffic.
- The Belt Parkway is a parking lot.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.710
Satan, guide them.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.131
Sorry. I was just dramatically walking
around the cemetery.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.342
I live there at night.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.594
That's him!

21:02.678 --> 21:04.554
The Afro-American one.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.242
Unless you're about to sing "Jump,"
you better put away that pointer, sister.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.686
Officers, Jermaine here
has been casing the neighborhood

21:10.769 --> 21:12.854
and break-dancing in the cemetery.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.940
I was being chased by a moth!

21:15.023 --> 21:17.526
Anthony, that is uncalled for.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.530
Hey, Dad, I know you don't do
big speeches, but...

21:21.613 --> 21:23.448
maybe Titus has one prepared.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.212
You want to come out to this guy as black?

21:25.284 --> 21:29.121
I will need a microphone, a face towel,
and some live butterflies.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.082
The game Pictionary

21:32.165 --> 21:36.753
defines "bigotry"
as two different-size stick men,

21:36.837 --> 21:39.506
and you circle the larger one

21:39.589 --> 21:42.217
for the "big" sound.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.972
And then you draw a tree.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.433
Why are you treating me like this?

21:49.516 --> 21:52.769
Because this isn't Earth,
straight astronaut.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.146
This is the gay planet...

21:54.229 --> 21:57.524
I mean black planet, white astronaut.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.067
Think about it.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.988
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.449
If you tickle us...

22:05.532 --> 22:07.284
do we not Elmo?

Oh!

22:27.846 --> 22:30.140
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.350
The magic of tolerance.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.152
Okay, I tried being mad,
and I don't like it.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.238
So it's not like this
is <i>Green Eggs and Ham.</i>

22:45.322 --> 22:47.574
I give up.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.868

What happened to my dress?

23:00.337 --> 23:03.799
Oh, this is a new special dress
for the Prince's Ball.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.301
A prince? What prince?

23:06.384 --> 23:09.096
Well, he said he was a prince,

23:31.910 --> 23:33.787
I can feel all of this.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.206
Mmm, he tastes yummier than lettuce.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.835
Aah! Oh.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.671
Kimmy Schmidt,
don't you crush my sk...

23:42.754 --> 23:44.631
Where do you think you're going?

23:44.714 --> 23:45.799
Bippity-boppity...

23:45.882 --> 23:47.259
No, my face!

23:51.805 --> 23:53.390
You broke my happy place.

23:53.473 --> 23:54.808
It used to be like Disney World,

23:54.891 --> 23:57.060
but now it's the unhappiest place
on Earth,

23:57.144 --> 23:59.187
like everywhere else in Florida.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.981
Slow down. I'm drunk.

24:01.064 --> 24:04.609
And what do you think
you've learned from all this?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.862
Nothing. That I hate the Reverend.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.488
Biggest duh ever!

24:08.572 --> 24:10.407
No. It's not about the Reverend.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.118
I mean, it's a lot about the Reverend,

24:13.201 --> 24:16.371
but to quote Salt-N-Pepa,

24:16.454 --> 24:18.206
"That's not it."

24:18.290 --> 24:20.375
Who else is there?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.877
The flying lady.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.796
I mean, she didn't take care of you,
so you killed her.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.549
I wonder who she's supposed to be, Andrea.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.385
- What older lady...
- You are.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.846
...has been all up
in my brain tubes lately?

24:32.929 --> 24:35.432
No! Not me. I'm here for you.

24:35.515 --> 24:39.144
I had just gotten a booty call
from my doorman when you showed up.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.688
And who did I choose? Both.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.773
But in what order?

24:43.857 --> 24:46.067
You first.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.696
No, that Fairy Godmother, she set you up
and then tried to leave,

24:49.779 --> 24:51.865
and that made you mad.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.617
Like when I flipped out on Lillian.

24:53.700 --> 24:57.787
So can you think
of any other woman in your life

24:57.871 --> 24:59.915
who has let you down a lot

24:59.998 --> 25:03.251
who maybe you blame
'cause of you're in the bunker?

25:04.711 --> 25:06.963
And this glass is gonna be
lights out, so...

25:07.047 --> 25:09.132
get there quick.

25:13.887 --> 25:14.930
My mother?

25:15.013 --> 25:18.391
Bingo! Ain't just a river in Egypt.

25:20.727 --> 25:24.272
Oh, daytime me is like,
"This is a process.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.607
This takes time."

25:25.690 --> 25:28.401
But actually, it's always the parents.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.736
Always.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.196
They fugyup.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.864
So what does that mean?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.700
It's not enough that I was kidnapped
for 15 years?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.744
Now I have to deal with Lori-Ann Schmidt?

25:37.827 --> 25:40.080
If that's your mom. Otherwise, no.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.625
- Ow!
- Me and you.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.377
We're gonna figure this out,

25:45.460 --> 25:48.838
like a couple of lesbians
hooking up a hot-water heater.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.096
But, hey...

25:56.179 --> 25:59.933
that mom stuff, that's a breakthrough...

26:00.016 --> 26:01.309
for realsies.

26:05.438 --> 26:09.567
I don't have any stickers left,
so just, um...

26:09.651 --> 26:10.651
take a thingy.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.838
Lillian! There you are.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.923
I don't have time for this, Kimmy.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.718
No, let me apologize
for calling you the B word,

26:34.801 --> 26:37.971
'cause what you really are
is a massive C word...

26:38.054 --> 26:39.514
class act.

26:39.597 --> 26:41.266
Ah, don't apologize to me.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.767
You were right.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.269
I am a bitch.

26:44.352 --> 26:48.523
No matter what anyone thinks,
I'm tough as hell.

26:48.606 --> 26:49.816
And I'll prove it.

26:49.899 --> 26:50.900
Hit me!

26:50.984 --> 26:52.819
I'm stronger than Houdini!

26:52.902 --> 26:54.070
- Who?
- Dini.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.780
And I hit back.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.867
But looking like this,
they'll never see it coming.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.201
Hey, what's going on over here?

27:00.285 --> 27:03.288
Oh, is there a problem, Officer?

27:03.371 --> 27:04.247
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.101
I didn't realize you were a sweet old lady
trying to save a young prostitute.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.252
- Aw.
- Why does everyone always think I'm...

27:09.336 --> 27:10.420
Let me help you with those.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.255
Oh, thank you so much.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.506
Sure.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.595
Oh.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.513
Come on. Follow me.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.557
Wait. What are we doing?

27:26.770 --> 27:30.315
They think
they're gonna build condos here.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.444
Let's see 'em try.

27:36.654 --> 27:40.033

- Who's a sweet old lady now?
