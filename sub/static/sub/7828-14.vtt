00:34.600 --> 00:35.630
And now, to top off...

00:35.799 --> 00:38.551
...our most propane-explosion-free
Science Week ever...

00:38.761 --> 00:41.880
...our grand finale:
The launching of a weather balloon.

00:43.641 --> 00:47.560
Go, weather balloon!
Hurrah for science, whoo!

00:47.269 --> 00:49.476
"Hurrah for science, whoo"?

00:49.647 --> 00:53.596
I can't say I approve of the "whoo,"
but the "hurrah" was quite heartening.

00:53.776 --> 00:55.768
Release the balloon.

00:55.986 --> 00:58.442
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:11.877 --> 01:15.328
No!

01:18.258 --> 01:21.793
- I don't think I really captured the eyes.
- Bart, if you have a failing...

01:21.971 --> 01:24.296
...it's that you're always
demanding perfection.

01:24.473 --> 01:25.884
If you have a failing.

01:26.580 --> 01:30.560
Whoever brings down that balloon
doesn't have to learn fractions.

01:34.274 --> 01:36.660
Careful, children. That's my car.

01:40.197 --> 01:43.364
- Destroy that balloon.
- Aye.

01:45.285 --> 01:48.785
Tango 14, we're being fired at.
I'm getting an ID on the bogey now.

01:52.376 --> 01:55.810
Iraqis again.
Launching Sidewinder missile.

01:58.716 --> 02:01.835
Missed him.
Launching second Sidewinder missile.

02:06.557 --> 02:09.511
This is what happens when
you cut money out of the military...

02:09.685 --> 02:12.223
...and put it into healthcare.
- It's a good program.

02:12.396 --> 02:15.170
Just give it a chance, that's all I ask.

02:21.530 --> 02:24.697
It won't come down for months.
Curse the man who invented helium.

02:24.867 --> 02:27.239
Curse Pierre Jules César Janssen.

02:27.786 --> 02:29.909
Now to find out who did this.

02:30.414 --> 02:33.498
- Bart, empty your pockets.
- Empty my pockets, you say?

02:33.667 --> 02:37.665
Well, certainly,
but I fail to see how...

02:37.880 --> 02:42.127
Blueprints of the dummy, notarized
photos of you making the dummy...

02:42.384 --> 02:44.377
...and an alternate wording
for the banner.

02:46.130 --> 02:49.298
- Race you to Utah, Milhouse.
- Okay.

02:49.892 --> 02:52.217
I am going to punish you
for this, Bart.

02:52.394 --> 02:54.766
And it won't just be
a simple caning this time.

02:54.938 --> 02:59.766
Because you have impeded science,
you must now aid science.

02:59.943 --> 03:04.570
Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will
assist me with my amateur astronomy.

03:04.740 --> 03:07.575
Taking down coordinates,
carrying equipment and so forth.

03:07.743 --> 03:10.578
- Four-thirty in the morning.
- There's a 4:30 in the morning now?

03:13.999 --> 03:18.163
Top of the hour, time for the news.
But of course, there is no news yet.

03:18.337 --> 03:23.248
Everyone's still asleep in their comfy,
comfy beds. Good night, everybody.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.714
Mom, will you make me breakfast?

03:30.570 --> 03:33.592
There's a stuffed pepper
in the trash from last night.

03:33.769 --> 03:35.762
Just rinse it good.

03:36.188 --> 03:39.639
Come on, Lassie. Here, boy.
Come on, girl.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.103
Attaboy.

03:53.205 --> 03:56.159
Still dark. Better use the generator.

04:10.556 --> 04:12.548
There's nothing more
exciting than science.

04:12.766 --> 04:15.601
You get all the fun of sitting still,
being quiet...

04:15.769 --> 04:18.391
...writing down numbers,
paying attention.

04:18.564 --> 04:20.230
Science has it all.

04:20.232 --> 04:22.225
Is that the telescope
we'll look through?

04:22.401 --> 04:25.734
Yes, but you won't be looking
through it. I forbid it.

04:25.904 --> 04:28.312
But you don't need a telescope
to enjoy astronomy.

04:28.490 --> 04:31.444
There are all the constellations
you've heard so much about.

04:31.660 --> 04:35.195
There's Orion, the Swan,
the Chariot Race.

04:35.372 --> 04:37.614
Why don't they look anything
like their names?

04:37.833 --> 04:39.624
You do have to use your imagination.

04:39.835 --> 04:42.770
Look, there's the Three Wise Men.

04:42.254 --> 04:43.665
Who names these things?

04:43.881 --> 04:46.917
Whoever discovers them.
I've been hoping I can find something...

04:47.920 --> 04:50.930
...that would be named after me.
- You've never found anything?

04:50.262 --> 04:53.140
Once. But by the time
I got to a phone...

04:53.182 --> 04:57.262
...my discovery had already been
reported by Principal Kohoutek.

04:57.436 --> 05:01.813
I got back at him, though.
Him and that little boy of his.

05:01.982 --> 05:04.900
Anyway, that's why I always keep
a cellular phone next to me.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.610
Now, this morning we're
gonna be mapping...

05:07.237 --> 05:10.322
...a square of sky that's thought
to be empty. I hope it's not.

05:10.532 --> 05:12.691
So, what am I supposed
to do exactly?

05:12.910 --> 05:15.401
Just write down my findings
as I give them to you.

05:15.579 --> 05:20.822
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 22 minutes declination.

05:21.377 --> 05:22.871
No sighting.

05:23.420 --> 05:28.759
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 23 minutes declination.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.301
No sighting.

05:31.720 --> 05:37.307
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 58 minutes declination.

05:39.186 --> 05:41.600
No sighting.
Did you get that one, Bart?

05:41.230 --> 05:42.973
- Hell, no.
- Good.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.620
My stars. Give me the phone, quick.

05:48.487 --> 05:52.271
Check out 6-19-14-59.

05:59.289 --> 06:03.619
No. No, there's no need for that.
It's already named after me.

06:03.836 --> 06:06.540
It's pretty close to the ground.
Maybe I can catch it.

06:06.714 --> 06:10.794
Don't touch the telescope, Bart.
Even a slight change in elevation...

06:10.968 --> 06:13.174
...can destroy a whole morning's work.

06:19.184 --> 06:22.388
All hands on deck.
Pirates off the port bow.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.639
Hey.

06:30.237 --> 06:32.775
Observatory? This is Bart Simpson.

06:32.948 --> 06:38.250
I see something in the sky at 4-12-8,
and the last number is seven.

06:43.625 --> 06:46.994
Got you, my rumpy doppelgänger.

06:48.714 --> 06:52.213
I've got it. What are you doing?
Give me that phone.

06:52.426 --> 06:55.629
Congratulations, Bart.
You've just discovered a comet.

06:55.804 --> 06:59.800
No!

07:00.434 --> 07:04.348
No!

07:06.315 --> 07:10.443
No!

07:16.533 --> 07:20.680
And then I sped away without
anyone seeing my license plate.

07:20.287 --> 07:22.790
Sounds like you had a good day, Dad.

07:22.247 --> 07:25.747
Yeah. Except I forgot to go to work.

07:25.918 --> 07:27.495
What did you do today, Bart?

07:27.670 --> 07:29.911
What didn't I do?

07:30.130 --> 07:32.400
- "Boy Discovers Comet."
- What?

07:32.174 --> 07:35.450
"A young Springfieldianite
has discovered a new comet...

07:35.219 --> 07:37.544
...to be known as
the Bart Simpson Comet."

07:37.721 --> 07:40.343
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.

07:40.516 --> 07:43.185
But then you've always
been proud of me.

07:43.978 --> 07:45.388
Yes.

07:50.943 --> 07:52.900
Won't you join us, Bart?

07:57.783 --> 07:59.111
I guess so.

07:59.284 --> 08:03.578
As the first student at Springfield
Elementary to discover a comet...

08:03.747 --> 08:07.875
...we're very proud to make you
a member of our very select group.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.914
Welcome to Super Friends!

08:11.588 --> 08:13.628
Welcome, Super Friend!

08:13.799 --> 08:18.100
I am called Ham,
since I enjoy Ham Radio.

08:18.178 --> 08:24.762
This is E-Mail, Cosine, Report Card,
Database and Lisa.

08:24.935 --> 08:27.604
Your nickname will be Cosmos.

08:29.773 --> 08:31.315
Well, I'm done eating. Goodbye.

08:31.483 --> 08:34.318
- Goodbye, Cosmos.
- Bye-bye.

08:34.486 --> 08:36.812
Perhaps some night
you could show us your comet.

08:36.989 --> 08:39.195
- There it is right there.
- I make it a point...

08:39.366 --> 08:42.710
...never turn my head unless
I expect to see something.

08:42.244 --> 08:46.953
Naturally, we can't see your comet in
broad daylight and without a telescope.

08:47.166 --> 08:51.246
But you don't need a stupid telescope.
It's right there.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.874
Oh, no, no! This isn't right at all!

08:55.490 --> 08:58.464
It must be coming toward us
at a fantastic speed.

08:59.178 --> 09:02.547
Don't you realize what's happening?
Your comet will collide with Earth.

09:02.723 --> 09:04.632
Everything in its path will be killed.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.555
I knew you'd try to find something
wrong with my comet.

09:07.728 --> 09:10.978
You've always been petty and small,
right from the beginning.

09:11.148 --> 09:15.442
- We must alert the proper authorities.
- To the observatory!

09:19.657 --> 09:21.733
We are the Super Friends

09:21.909 --> 09:23.451
Hey, shut up.

09:28.624 --> 09:30.201
- Dear God!
- Warren...

09:30.376 --> 09:33.163
...we've talked about you
hogging the eyepiece.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.672
Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle.

09:40.886 --> 09:45.465
Ain't been blown
for nigh on to three years.

09:46.266 --> 09:47.595
Trouble a-brewing.

09:49.190 --> 09:52.222
Fellow citizens, when I learned
about the impending crisis...

09:52.398 --> 09:55.564
...I caught the very next plane
to Springfeld. Field.

09:58.279 --> 10:03.439
First, yes, there is a comet in the sky.
And yes, it is going to hit Springfield.

10:05.494 --> 10:07.360
You don't need to applaud that.

10:07.204 --> 10:10.454
Now, here's what we think
the impact might look like.

10:10.666 --> 10:12.326
Show them, Jerry.

10:18.424 --> 10:19.882
Oh, dear God, no!

10:22.720 --> 10:25.258
Fortunately, we have a plan.
Professor Frink?

10:25.431 --> 10:27.910
Hi. Good evening, ladies and...

10:27.266 --> 10:29.555
Einstein, what's the plan?!

10:29.852 --> 10:31.761
All right, just take your seat.

10:31.937 --> 10:34.772
Now, working with former
Carter-administration officials...

10:34.940 --> 10:37.858
...and military men who were
forced into early retirement...

10:38.270 --> 10:40.778
For various reasons which
we won't go into here, okay?

10:40.988 --> 10:43.395
- We have planned this defense
for the city.

10:43.657 --> 10:47.821
As the comet hurdles toward the city,
our rocket will intercept it...

10:47.995 --> 10:50.710
...and blow it to smithereens. Right!

10:54.460 --> 10:56.840
That will be the end of our Mr. Comet.

10:56.503 --> 10:58.211
We're saved!

11:08.849 --> 11:12.633
Will you all stop worrying about that
stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed.

11:12.811 --> 11:15.219
Didn't you hear what that guy
in the building said?

11:15.397 --> 11:17.556
- But, Dad, don't you think...?
- Lisa.

11:17.775 --> 11:22.437
The reason we have elected officials
is so we don't have to think all the time.

11:22.613 --> 11:25.697
Just like that rain-forest scare
a few years back.

11:25.908 --> 11:29.277
Our officials saw there was a problem,
and they fixed it, didn't they?

11:29.453 --> 11:32.122
- No, Dad. I don't think...
- There's that word again.

11:55.145 --> 11:58.645
- Homer, what if this doesn't work?
- Well, then I have a backup plan.

11:58.816 --> 12:01.567
See, while the unprepared
are still sitting around...

12:01.735 --> 12:04.570
...twiddling their thumbs and going:

12:10.953 --> 12:13.989
- Dad! The plan.
- I'm getting to that.

12:14.206 --> 12:16.578
So anyway, they're going:

12:22.756 --> 12:24.665
- Dad!
- So anyway, we get in our car...

12:24.842 --> 12:29.634
...and take the bridge out of town.
While all the while, they're still going:

12:32.516 --> 12:35.540
Dad, they're firing the rocket!

12:37.229 --> 12:38.889
All right!

12:53.746 --> 12:56.284
It blew up the bridge! We're doomed!

12:56.457 --> 12:59.707
It's times like this
I wish I were a religious man.

12:59.877 --> 13:05.370
It's all over, people!
We don't have a prayer!

13:16.769 --> 13:19.805
And like Icarus,
the rocket foolishly soared too high...

13:21.982 --> 13:23.939
...and lost control of its
servo-guidance mechanism...

13:24.109 --> 13:26.268
...leaving us with some...

13:26.445 --> 13:28.272
...six hours to live.

13:28.489 --> 13:32.569
So let's go live now to the charred
remains of the only bridge out of town...

13:32.743 --> 13:35.448
...with Arnie Pie
and "Arnie in the Sky."

13:35.621 --> 13:39.321
With the bridge gone and the airport
on the other side of the bridge...

13:39.500 --> 13:43.340
...a number of citizens are attempting
to jump the gorge with their cars.

13:43.253 --> 13:45.875
It's a silent testament
to the never-give-up...

13:46.480 --> 13:49.215
...and never-think-things-out
spirit of our citizens.

13:49.426 --> 13:52.795
With our annihilation imminent, our
government has snapped into action.

13:52.971 --> 13:56.554
We go live now via satellite to the
floor of the United States Congress.

13:59.645 --> 14:02.646
Then it is unanimous.
We are going to approve the bill...

14:02.815 --> 14:05.222
...to evacuate
the town of Springfield...

14:05.401 --> 14:07.607
...in the great state of...
- Wait a second.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.646
I wanna tack on a rider to that bill.

14:09.822 --> 14:13.107
Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money
to support the perverted arts.

14:13.325 --> 14:18.664
All in favor of the amended
Springfield/pervert bill?

14:19.915 --> 14:21.243
Bill defeated.

14:21.542 --> 14:26.204
I've said it before and I'll say it again,
democracy simply doesn't work.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.297
Now, over the years a newsman
learns a number of things...

14:29.466 --> 14:32.669
...that for one reason or another
he just cannot report.

14:32.845 --> 14:35.300
It doesn't seem to matter now, so...

14:35.180 --> 14:37.469
The following people are gay.

14:38.350 --> 14:41.600
- Turn it off.
- Just a second.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.309
What's everyone so worked up about?
So there's a comet.

14:48.485 --> 14:51.689
Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere
and what's ever left...

14:51.864 --> 14:54.220
...will be no bigger
than a Chihuahua's head.

14:54.199 --> 14:57.533
- Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

14:57.703 --> 15:01.535
If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed
from above somehow.

15:02.666 --> 15:07.412
Okay, if you're that worried about it,
let's go down to the bomb shelter.

15:07.588 --> 15:08.999
We have a bomb shelter?

15:09.173 --> 15:12.257
Homer Simpson
takes care of his family.

15:13.802 --> 15:16.910
Flanders, open up!

15:16.889 --> 15:19.558
Hidy-ho-a-roonie, neighbor.
What can I do you for?

15:19.725 --> 15:22.430
Get out of there.
My family needs your bomb shelter.

15:22.603 --> 15:25.272
- Homer.
- I kind of figured this might happen.

15:25.481 --> 15:27.972
So I built the shelter big enough
for both families.

15:28.192 --> 15:31.193
- No deal. Out.
- Get in the shelter, Homer.

15:56.470 --> 15:59.305
- One more hour.
- An hour?

15:59.515 --> 16:03.762
I can't wait another hour.
What's keeping that stupid comet?

16:04.186 --> 16:05.894
There it is.

16:08.774 --> 16:11.526
Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors.

16:11.694 --> 16:14.185
Shouldn't you be
in your shelterinies by now?

16:14.363 --> 16:17.530
We haven't got shelterinies.
We want in yours.

16:17.950 --> 16:20.571
Well, sorry. Shelter's kind of full.

16:20.786 --> 16:22.161
Really?

16:22.579 --> 16:25.746
Well, we'll just go off someplace
and die then. Thanks.

16:28.460 --> 16:31.876
Wait. You know, I may regret
this when our air runs out...

16:32.470 --> 16:35.748
...and we can't whistle or stay alive,
but, oh, what the hey.

16:37.928 --> 16:39.755
All right.

16:41.150 --> 16:44.134
I can't get the...

16:44.351 --> 16:47.554
I can't get the door closed.
Somebody's gonna have to get out.

16:47.730 --> 16:50.399
I'd get out,
but I don't know where I am.

16:50.566 --> 16:53.732
- Hey, somebody's touching me.
- I am.

16:53.902 --> 16:55.610
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, okay.

16:55.779 --> 16:59.650
Let's figure out who should stay.
Let's see.

16:59.241 --> 17:02.906
In the world of the future,
we'll need laughter, so I'm in.

17:03.780 --> 17:07.123
And it'll need somebody
to dispense drinks, i.e. Me.

17:07.290 --> 17:11.390
And someone will have to run the power.
You can do that, Homer.

17:11.211 --> 17:14.545
Yeah. I can do that.

17:17.343 --> 17:19.419
Okay, let's start again.

17:19.636 --> 17:22.554
We'll need laughter,
religious enlightenment, gossip.

17:22.723 --> 17:24.881
- That's Mrs. Lovejoy.
- Wait a minute.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.884
We all know the one thing we won't
need in the future: Left-handed stores.

17:29.630 --> 17:30.521
That's you, Flanders!

17:31.899 --> 17:36.193
I'm terribly sorry.
Flanders is the only useless person here.

17:36.362 --> 17:38.900
If anyone dies, it should be him.

17:39.730 --> 17:41.777
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

17:41.950 --> 17:45.284
So let's kick Flanders out.
Sorry.

17:45.871 --> 17:48.290
Well, sir, sounds fair.

17:48.207 --> 17:51.410
Toodle-loo, everybody.
I'll scream when the comet gets here.

17:51.585 --> 17:54.586
- Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddie.
- No, sweetheart.

17:54.755 --> 17:58.539
- You... You stay here, because...
- Okay.

17:59.176 --> 18:01.963
I might go mad with fear out there,
so, Todd...

18:02.137 --> 18:06.716
...I want you to shoot Daddy
if he tries to get back in.

18:06.892 --> 18:09.763
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay.

18:27.121 --> 18:28.829
Hey, I got an idea.

18:28.998 --> 18:31.489
We can play a game to pass the time.

18:31.667 --> 18:37.207
I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal,
and you all try to guess what it is.

18:41.844 --> 18:43.504
- It's a pig.
- It's a cow, man.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.630
- It's a pony.
- No, it's a goat.

18:45.806 --> 18:48.641
- You know, one of them lady goats.
- There are no lady goats.

18:48.809 --> 18:51.980
- A lady goat is a sheep.
- I believe she's right.

18:51.312 --> 18:53.470
- You're crazy.
- What's it to you?

18:53.647 --> 18:55.854
- What's it to me?
- Hey, it's a pony!

18:56.250 --> 18:58.729
- Shut up!
- Doesn't anybody care that I'm hungry?

18:58.902 --> 19:02.770
Stop it, stop it. Can't you see
this barnyard-noise guessing game...

19:02.948 --> 19:05.320
...is tearing us apart?

19:12.291 --> 19:14.829
Say, Moe, was it a duck?

19:16.629 --> 19:18.835
I don't like it...

19:19.600 --> 19:23.834
No! No! Shut up! Shut up!
Stop it! Stop it!

19:24.110 --> 19:25.635
I can't take this anymore.

19:25.804 --> 19:29.900
I can't let that brave man
out there die alone.

19:29.266 --> 19:32.530
I'm surprised and disgusted
by all of you.

19:32.353 --> 19:34.179
Especially his children.

19:34.355 --> 19:36.312
I'm going out there.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.232
And it was a baby ox.

19:39.401 --> 19:41.109
- He's right, you know.
- About the ox?

19:41.278 --> 19:45.905
About everything, damn it!
Hey, Homer, wait up. I wanna die too.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.670
- If you are going, I am going.
- Me too.

19:48.243 --> 19:50.781
- Me too.
- I'm out of here. Make way.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.367
Radio reception in there sucked.

20:33.455 --> 20:35.330
Run!

20:41.380 --> 20:43.622
- Look!
- It's breaking up!

20:57.104 --> 21:00.555
- Cool.
- We're saved!

21:02.318 --> 21:06.446
Sure makes you appreciate
the preciousness of life.

21:07.698 --> 21:11.992
Let's go burn down the observatory
so this'll never happen again.

21:14.121 --> 21:18.710
I can't believe that extra-thick layer
of pollution that I've picketed against...

21:18.250 --> 21:21.204
...is what burned up the comet.
- What's really amazing...

21:21.378 --> 21:25.791
...is that this is exactly what Dad
said would happen.

21:25.966 --> 21:28.600
Yeah. Dad was right.

21:28.177 --> 21:31.842
I know, kids. I'm scared too.
