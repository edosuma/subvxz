We need to make

00:05.962 --> 00:07.050
the detective realize

00:07.094 --> 00:08.225

00:08.269 --> 00:09.226

00:09.270 --> 00:10.575
If we don't get Chloe
to love you,

time, I can wait.

You're worth it.

I want her to choose me.Then tell her.

Well, Marcus and I
thought why wait?

When you know,
you know, right?

01:54.766 --> 01:55.985
I'm not talking

No, I am talking about
the bachelorette party.

Well, it's the
second wedding.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.164
Do I need one?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.557
Uh, yeah, you do.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.472
It sets the foundation
for your whole support system.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.300
And trust me,
you're gonna need one

02:06.343 --> 02:08.911

02:14.743 --> 02:16.179
Dark days ahead, indeed.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.572
I may have to take my chances.

02:17.615 --> 02:18.703
Uh, Decker.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.751
All of my life,
I have been dreaming

02:22.794 --> 02:24.579
of the chance to plan
a bachelorette party.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.015
But four brothers.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.495
Remember?

02:27.538 --> 02:30.062
And you're the closest thing
I have to a sister right now.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.152
Well... [sighs]

02:32.195 --> 02:34.023
I guess if you're gonna
play the sister card.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.372
Yes!

02:35.416 --> 02:36.678
Oh, wait.
Let's talk theme.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.594
The bachelorette
and wedding should match.

02:39.637 --> 02:44.860
You know, color palette, dress,
cake, venue, flowers...

02:44.903 --> 02:47.210
Playlist, DJ, tuxedo,

02:47.254 --> 02:48.690
marriage license.Right.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.213
We have the nice bottle

02:50.257 --> 02:51.606
of single malt for the bar,

02:51.649 --> 02:53.042
which is gonna be open,

02:53.085 --> 02:55.087
which means we need to
get a couple bartenders.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.438
This is a lot, isn't it?

02:57.481 --> 02:59.875
It's, uh... [chuckles]

02:59.918 --> 03:02.094
Do you think we should maybe
postpone the date?

03:02.138 --> 03:03.052
Is that what you want?

03:03.095 --> 03:04.445
No. No.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.142
Totally and completely no.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.622
I-- unless...

03:07.665 --> 03:09.711
unless you do.Absolutely not.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.104
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.631
I mean, look, we solve murders.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.894
How hard can it be
to plan one little wedding?Yeah.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.548
But I think I know what'll help.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.245
Hmm?I recently discovered
that a certain detective

03:22.289 --> 03:24.943
has weeks
of unused vacation days.

03:24.987 --> 03:28.120
Couple days away from the office
might give you time to plan.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.560
Chloe said yes?

03:32.603 --> 03:34.736
To marry Pierce?It's mind-boggling,

03:34.779 --> 03:36.390
I know.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.782
I mean,
when I said I was at peace

03:37.826 --> 03:39.567
with the detective
making her own choices,

03:39.610 --> 03:41.221
it didn't occur to me

03:41.264 --> 03:44.441
that she'd be capable of making
such a spectacularly bad one.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.747
I mean,

03:45.790 --> 03:47.096
why on earth?

03:47.139 --> 03:48.750
Why is besides
the point, Luci.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.099
We can't allow this to happen.

03:50.142 --> 03:53.581
Oh, I like this new you.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.931
I wish you'd realized
I was your test eons ago.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.672
Luci, it is God's will that you

03:57.715 --> 03:58.977
and Chloe...Yeah, don't ruin it.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.283
I'm just happy

04:00.327 --> 04:02.416
that we're on the same side
for once.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.331
So, what's the plan?

04:04.374 --> 04:07.377
The plan... is simple.

04:07.421 --> 04:08.770
The plan is simple.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.424
I'm going to try
to understand why

04:10.467 --> 04:12.121
the detective
would want to marry

04:12.164 --> 04:13.296
that overstuffed man ham

04:13.340 --> 04:15.603
and then make her see
she's deranged.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.605
Or you could just tell her
how you feel.

04:17.648 --> 04:21.696
I already missed my window
for that, unfortunately.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.220
He's weaseled his way
into her heart,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.048
and I don't understand how,

04:26.091 --> 04:28.006
but I need to.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.443
Well, good luck.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.793
And I will come up with a plan
that will actually work.

04:31.836 --> 04:32.924
Of course you will.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.187
[chuckles]

04:35.231 --> 04:36.624
Ah, Detective.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.321
You look nice.Thank you.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.889
Uh, anyway, since
changes are afoot,

04:40.932 --> 04:42.760
I'd like to address
things head-on.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.981
Oh. Well,
that's oddly mature of you.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.983
And it's... it's nice to know

04:48.026 --> 04:49.724
that you're not gonna start
acting all weird.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.944
[laughs, exhales]

04:52.988 --> 04:55.991
Oh, what's this?
Is this an engagement gift?

04:56.034 --> 04:57.819
It's much better than that.
It's a personality test.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.212
So I can understand why
you do the things you do

05:00.256 --> 05:02.650
and, uh, decide
the things you decide.

05:02.693 --> 05:03.868
A personality test?

05:03.912 --> 05:05.348
So much for not acting weird.

05:05.392 --> 05:08.003
What? You know, to help
optimize our partnership.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.483
Okay, well,
it's gonna have to wait,

05:09.526 --> 05:11.833

time off to plan the wedding.

Well, how about

05:20.189 --> 05:21.364

Because my cases
have been reassigned,

he'd appreciate the help.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.243
Well, looks like it's

certainly would.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.081
The bitch is innocent.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.257
Cause of death
was blunt force trauma,

the license plate

08:36.907 --> 08:37.995
Yeah.

Right. Thank you.

why I called you.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.015

09:24.607 --> 09:25.913

second thoughts about you.

new lead in this case.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.759
Oh, the case. Right.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.805
What's going on with that?I-I ran a partial license

10:31.848 --> 10:33.197
and got a match.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.373
Security footage
shows the suspect's car

10:35.417 --> 10:36.679
at the location of the murder.

10:36.723 --> 10:37.985
Okay, who is it registered to?

10:38.028 --> 10:39.203
You will never know that

10:39.247 --> 10:41.553

20 minutes ago

for a wardrobe change.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.591

the plate of the guy

named Vincent Walker.

So we should, you know, hurry.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.558
Well, I'm going as fast
as I can.

You're going 34 in a 35, man.[horn honks]

11:31.778 --> 11:34.128
I can't risk accidentally
going over the speed limit.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.695
The detective wouldn't.

11:35.738 --> 11:39.046
Why don't you just ask Chloe
why she said yes to Pierce?

11:39.089 --> 11:43.441
Oh, there's no point bothering
the detective on her time off.

11:43.485 --> 11:46.227
But speaking of
baffling unions,

11:46.270 --> 11:48.838
how are you doing? You and
Charlotte still a thing?

11:48.882 --> 11:51.493
Oh, I...[horn honks]

11:51.536 --> 11:54.322

Hmm.

But thank you for caring, man.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.634

12:17.127 --> 12:19.260
This a bad time?I could use a break

12:19.303 --> 12:21.610
from prosecuting the
Malibu State water polo team.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.959
Well, I was hoping
that you might be able

12:23.003 --> 12:24.308
to help me out again.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.789
I know we failed to prove
Pierce is The Sinnerman,

12:26.833 --> 12:28.791
but I've still been digging,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.576
and I am confident
that eventually...

12:31.620 --> 12:33.796
Actually, I'm taking a different
angle this time, Charlotte.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
I need to split up
the engagement

12:35.667 --> 12:37.104
between him and Chloe.

12:37.147 --> 12:40.934
Any chance to get in
His good graces, I'm in.

12:40.977 --> 12:44.459
The thing is, Pierce seems
to genuinely be in love.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.766
To stop this, we would
have to understand him,

12:46.809 --> 12:50.595
and that... that guy
is impenetrable.

12:50.639 --> 12:53.250
Well, if being a trial lawyer
has taught me anything,

12:53.294 --> 12:56.297
it's that there's always a way
to get inside someone's head,

12:56.340 --> 12:58.473
get them to have
a change of heart.

12:58.516 --> 12:59.822
Go on.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.651
You're both former immortals

own fears and insecurities,

13:07.221 --> 13:09.832
Not the easiest,
I know.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.181
But worthy of a test.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.792
Hmm.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.665
Well, while I'm doing that,
perhaps you can work on Chloe?

13:16.708 --> 13:19.276
Guess who just got invited
to Chloe's bachelorette party,

13:23.063 --> 13:25.152
Exactly.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.807
Chloe will be drunk
in some stripper's arms

13:27.850 --> 13:31.332

in no time.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.335
All I have to do
is water the seeds of doubt.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.469

Vince Walker's record's

13:38.513 --> 13:40.210

violence, man.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.738

attention or what?
Hmm?

13:47.914 --> 13:50.003
Oh, yes, whoever
wanted Francis dead

13:50.046 --> 13:52.353
probably hired this
Vincent chap to kill him.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.528
And I'd say,

13:53.571 --> 13:55.008
based on the security
around that doorway

13:55.051 --> 13:56.705
over there,
and the fact I've been here

13:56.748 --> 13:59.577
many times before,
that is an illegal gambling den.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.057
As such,
it's a reasonable assumption

14:01.101 --> 14:02.667
that our devious
murderer's in there.

14:02.711 --> 14:03.712
Nice work.
You actually have

14:03.755 --> 14:06.062

down pat.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.325

27:01.794 --> 27:03.447
Mm.

I'm...

27:04.753 --> 27:06.625
Mm-hmm.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.106
I'm really all good.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.412
Come now,

27:11.455 --> 27:14.981
there's really nothing you want
deep, deep down?

27:17.810 --> 27:21.291
I want the
miracle of birth.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.946
Trying to solve a murder here,
love, but I'm sure

27:23.990 --> 27:25.426
you can find someone
to help you with that.

27:25.469 --> 27:26.993
Eventually.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.777
You don't mean...

27:28.821 --> 27:30.344
for you, do you?

27:32.738 --> 27:34.348
[whines softly]

27:37.612 --> 27:40.659
Of course I took the dog
when I had the chance.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.661
Do you know how
little I get paid?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.140
All the missed holidays?

27:44.184 --> 27:46.665
Dr. Valerie spends most
of her time in Hawaii.

27:46.708 --> 27:47.970
So I took Cornelia

27:48.014 --> 27:49.145
and I hid her here.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.973
And when Francis tried
to stop you,

27:51.017 --> 27:52.322
you, what, killed him?

27:52.366 --> 27:54.498
No! I wasbackstage,

27:54.542 --> 27:55.935
but he was already dead.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.632
Cornelia was frantic.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.633
She came to me.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.069
She's very particular,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.680
and she knew
that I would take care of her.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.333
By selling her precious babies?

28:03.377 --> 28:05.118
I know it was wrong,

28:05.161 --> 28:07.990
but I was gonna return her
right after she gave birth.

Well, given motive
and lack of alibi,

but to follow

28:16.912 --> 28:18.871

and arrest you

for the murder

Marrying a second guy

While we're on the topic,

29:44.478 --> 29:47.263
I would love
some relationship advice.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.479
Nonsense. The detective would
never allow a pregnant lady

31:12.522 --> 31:14.916
to ride in the back

31:14.960 --> 31:16.439
How very sensitive of her.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.224

Yes. And so predictable.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.037
Okay. Yeah. Maybe...

31:49.081 --> 31:51.387
maybe I'm not great
at admitting what I want.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.097
Excuse me?

The reason you won't ask Chloe
why she's marrying Pierce

32:07.926 --> 32:09.536
is because you're scared
to hear the answer.

Indeed. To truly
understand

the detective's human dependent

34:03.867 --> 34:05.826
can be bribed
with chocolate and cash.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.176
But apparently, chocolate's
toxic for Ms. Picky here.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.569
And she ate my wallet.

What is that smell?
And why is there...Hmm?

34:11.875 --> 34:14.704
...crime scene tape
all around my desk?Because trust me, Daniel,

serious infraction over there.

is exhausting.

the same thing myself.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.928
I don't know, m-maybe I thought

35:47.971 --> 35:49.756
that marrying a...

35:49.799 --> 35:53.542

35:53.586 --> 35:57.242

into a different person,

was signed by Frederick,

36:35.671 --> 36:39.458

about the pregnancy.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.417
And the signature's a match.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.637
Which means he lied.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.813
Ergo...

36:46.856 --> 36:49.294
