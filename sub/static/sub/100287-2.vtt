I was surprised by
the very spirited nature of the encounter.

-[Lloyd] Jesus.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.911
-[Shay] But it turns out,
she's not into vampirism or cannibalism.

02:45.011 --> 02:48.151
She's playing at black widow spiders -
homicidal post-coital behaviour.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.511
-[Lloyd] [chuckles] OK.

02:49.611 --> 02:51.671
-[Shay] Anyway, so I'm laying there
afterwards and I'm thinking,

02:51.771 --> 02:53.630
what if we induce a micro deletion

02:53.730 --> 02:55.910
of the HoxD gene clusters
of the female bugs,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.710
which, radically ramped up,

02:57.810 --> 03:01.130
not post-coital aggression,
but pre-coital aggression?

03:03.049 --> 03:05.589
So the males become
not an after-sex cigarette -

03:05.689 --> 03:08.029
they become a before-sex appetiser?

03:08.129 --> 03:10.129
They're dead before they shoot.

03:10.889 --> 03:14.228
In a generation, the females chomp
themselves out of sperm donors entirely.

-Don't treat me like a baby, Lloyd.

You got a sec?

04:20.761 --> 04:24.221
Just want to flag a notification
you'll get this afternoon.

04:24.321 --> 04:26.561
Shay, you've been picked
for national service duties.

04:27.641 --> 04:30.580
There are some projects
that are deemed significant enough

04:30.680 --> 04:32.460
to qualify for special exemptions

04:32.560 --> 04:37.000
but they're all predicated on results.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.659
It's two days a week
at one of the resettlement centres.

04:41.759 --> 04:46.319
Only leaves three days for you
to devote to your research here, so...

04:47.119 --> 04:49.218
The board has been alerted.

04:49.318 --> 04:54.018
But there's a good chance they'll think
it makes your position here untenable.

04:54.118 --> 04:56.698
I just wanted to let you know in person.

04:56.798 --> 04:58.137
I bet you did, Herm.

04:58.237 --> 05:03.497
Oh, and uh... you'll need to put some
thought into a replacement too... in time.

05:03.597 --> 05:05.217
I really appreciate that, Herman,

05:05.317 --> 05:07.696
but we'll find someone to swap out
Shay's national service days.

05:07.796 --> 05:10.296

some excellent candidates on my desk.

05:10.396 --> 05:13.576

just what you need to shake things up.

05:19.755 --> 05:21.755

We'll find someone, hey?

05:28.194 --> 05:29.454
Listen, I've...

05:29.554 --> 05:32.094
Yeah, it's Eadie's birthday.
I've got to get home.

05:32.194 --> 05:34.174
Why don't you come past in about an hour
and pick me up?

05:34.274 --> 05:35.973
-We'll go do the collections, yeah?
-Sure.

OK, good.

06:06.990 --> 06:09.370
that we were gonna pass on
the whole birthday celebration thing.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.610
No, no, no, this is

-OK.
-M'lady.

-Lloyd...
-Stop it. This is not even about you.

This is about Ivy and I, and our chance

06:34.187 --> 06:36.367
So you're gonna drink your latte,
eat your brownie

06:36.467 --> 06:38.827

Oh, my god.

I can't believe you did this.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.282
What did you do - cash in your super?

07:21.382 --> 07:23.862
No, I was just...
I've been ferreting a little bit away.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.902
What? [chuckles]

07:28.142 --> 07:30.041
It's nothing.

07:30.141 --> 07:32.401
Hey, what's... what's wrong?

07:32.501 --> 07:34.501
Nothing.

07:35.261 --> 07:36.961
It's not nothing.
It's definitely not nothing.

07:37.061 --> 07:39.041
-What's...
-No, it's just um...

07:39.141 --> 07:41.140
It's just...

07:41.500 --> 07:44.280
You know, the money thing
seemed to be one of the things...

07:44.380 --> 07:46.540
that was a sticking point
for any more IVF.

07:49.779 --> 07:51.679
Paying that much money,
that's<i> a</i> thing.

07:51.779 --> 07:53.779
That's not the thing.
That's not the thing.

07:54.499 --> 07:56.499
The real cost was you.

08:00.538 --> 08:05.318
Every failure we had,
a little bit of you... just disappeared.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.878
So I was done paying...

08:07.978 --> 08:09.977
to lose any more of you.

No, I know, but...
thanks for thinking about it.

-For not thinking I'm crazy.
-I do think you're crazy.

08:48.213 --> 08:49.673
I think you're gonna
screw up your marriage

08:49.773 --> 08:51.553
and hurt the kindest human being
on Earth.

08:51.653 --> 08:54.573
And I'm probably gonna do that
right along with you, so...

09:03.092 --> 09:04.552
I'm sorry.

09:04.652 --> 09:06.651
Yeah, it's all good.

09:08.811 --> 09:10.811
It's all good.

09:28.009 --> 09:30.669
[Shay] Hi, Corrine. Great night.
Really great.

09:30.769 --> 09:33.249
Shame we never got to that steak
but... hey.

09:34.248 --> 09:37.908
Anyway, I was thinking of you because
I've won the national service lottery

09:38.008 --> 09:40.468
and it's not fantastically great time
for me.

09:40.568 --> 09:45.627
And you did mention you love
charity work, so, yeah, anyway,

09:45.727 --> 09:48.307
if you feel like substituting for me
in the service of your nation,

09:48.407 --> 09:51.087
that's something that calls you,
get back to me.

09:53.406 --> 09:54.986
We'll find someone.

09:55.086 --> 09:57.466
Well, that's easy for you to say
with your special exemption

09:57.566 --> 09:59.426
from your high-powered brother-in-law.

09:59.526 --> 10:01.106
Did you have to blow him for that?

10:01.206 --> 10:03.345
Sadly, no.

10:03.445 --> 10:05.925
But I do have to look after his sister,
which...

10:06.605 --> 10:10.145
which, fortunately,
falls right into my game plan, so...

10:10.245 --> 10:12.264
Does that include
successful impregnation

10:12.364 --> 10:15.144
or does Dom keep his nose
out of the pants department?

10:15.244 --> 10:19.164
No, Dom is involved in
all the departments, but she's, er...

10:20.844 --> 10:23.863
Well, we're not...
We're stopping that train, so...

10:23.963 --> 10:24.983
Really?

10:25.083 --> 10:28.543
Just this whole post-38 landscape,
it's so grim.

10:28.643 --> 10:33.022
That's even without
Eadie's immune system issues.

10:33.122 --> 10:35.502
There was a moment there
she was talking about

10:35.602 --> 10:38.582
some dodgy off-the-books outfit
who'd do it for less.

10:38.682 --> 10:41.101
But, uh... it's just another
pack of vultures

10:41.201 --> 10:44.041
taking advantage of desperate people.

10:49.121 --> 10:51.640
I'm not sure we'd survive another round.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.840
[train approaching]

11:09.359 --> 11:11.778
-Dreams?
-No.

11:11.878 --> 11:15.058
And I've been having versions
of the same one for years.

11:15.158 --> 11:18.178
About the shooter?
What happens?

11:18.278 --> 11:20.537
I'm just staring at his face.

11:20.637 --> 11:24.437
And, in the dream, I think I suddenly
know why he doesn't shoot me.

11:25.637 --> 11:30.056
First, I think he's keeping me alive
so he can send me back, like a message,

11:30.156 --> 11:33.276
to show everyone that they can
get us anywhere, anytime.

11:34.196 --> 11:40.875
And then, that changes into thinking he's
turning me into a walking suicide bomb.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.195
Gonna slowly stagger my way to death.

11:45.795 --> 11:48.394
Interesting bit of
magical thinking there.

11:50.154 --> 11:52.154
Here's another version.

11:52.834 --> 11:56.814
His little brother
was saved by an Australian soldier

11:56.914 --> 11:58.913
who looked just like you.

11:59.873 --> 12:02.013
Might be true. Might not be.

12:02.113 --> 12:03.813
You'll never know.

12:03.913 --> 12:05.993
All you can do is choose to let go...

12:06.992 --> 12:08.992
of needing to know why.

12:14.752 --> 12:16.751
You OK?

12:19.511 --> 12:21.851
I've got the odd ghost too.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.951
I know a good therapist.

12:25.031 --> 12:27.030

don't you?

13:07.546 --> 13:09.286
Yeah.

[Ben exhales]

14:03.260 --> 14:04.720
Talk to me.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.820
I, uh...

14:08.420 --> 14:10.420
It was like...

14:12.179 --> 14:13.639
everything was happening.

14:13.739 --> 14:17.539
It was all still... real but...

14:18.299 --> 14:20.818
the... panic...

14:21.658 --> 14:23.658
and the fear...

14:24.618 --> 14:26.618
didn't come.

14:26.938 --> 14:28.938
Good.

14:29.858 --> 14:33.517
So, you need 24 hours in recovery.

14:33.617 --> 14:39.876
Then I can sign you out of here
and you can go and get on with your life.

14:39.976 --> 14:42.656
[chuckles] Thank you.

14:43.976 --> 14:45.976

You a private outfit?

15:36.131 --> 15:37.590
Yes, sir, we are.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.390
We can't pay you, mate,
so you might as well take back off

15:39.490 --> 15:41.490
and find someone who can, ey?

15:41.970 --> 15:46.110
It's gonna be another ten days 'til the
State Emergency Services can get to you.

15:46.210 --> 15:49.249
Now, I don't need payment
but I wouldn't say no to a hand.

15:50.289 --> 15:52.749
Yeah, sure. Come on, take it up, mate.

15:52.849 --> 15:54.069
Have you got water here?

15:54.169 --> 15:57.588
Oh, yeah, I've got a spring.
It's the only thing keeping us going.

15:57.688 --> 15:59.548
It's the ninth time
I've been cut off in two years.

15:59.648 --> 16:02.468
No way to get out of here.
No way for anyone to get in, either.

16:02.568 --> 16:04.468
Unless you've got a private chopper.

16:04.568 --> 16:06.427
-[both chuckle]
-There.

16:06.527 --> 16:08.527
Thanks. You take 'em.

16:09.807 --> 16:10.947
Yeah, I'm good.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.507
That looks nasty.

16:12.607 --> 16:16.626
Yeah. Yeah, the shed came down
when she was putting the goats in.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.586
Have you got someone else here
who can look after the kids?

16:18.686 --> 16:21.786
I could drop you two down at the hospital,
nip that infection in the bud.

16:21.886 --> 16:23.946
-I'd be in your debt. Thanks.
-[ringing]

16:24.046 --> 16:26.045
-Dom!
-Oh, hang on.

16:27.845 --> 16:29.845
Thanks, mate.

16:30.845 --> 16:32.385
Chesca, everything alright?

16:32.485 --> 16:34.344
It's Cosmo. He's... He's...

16:34.444 --> 16:37.144
He's calmer now but
he's locked himself in the bathroom.

16:37.244 --> 16:39.464
<i>-Where are the other kids?</i>
-Archie took them down to school.

16:39.564 --> 16:41.744
<i>-OK, well, listen, I'm out west.</i>
<i>I'll, uh...</i>

16:41.844 --> 16:44.983
I'll head straight back. I'll give Eadie
a call, get her to come over.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.463
Yeah? Just tell him Eadie's coming
and that I'll be there soon.

16:48.563 --> 16:50.183

How are you? How's the baby?

17:37.558 --> 17:40.998
Good. Everything good now.
We had a visit from the...

17:41.997 --> 17:44.577
[Tien speaks Vietnamese]

17:44.677 --> 17:46.217
[Sang] Vax doctors.

-[Lloyd] What did she say?
-That...

17:53.396 --> 17:57.956
they had a visit from a doctor
who'll charge them for a Chagas vaccine.

17:59.196 --> 18:02.295
There's no vaccine. Tell them.
There's no vaccine.

Oh... Those men... Those men,
they're... that's a scam.

18:16.674 --> 18:19.014
That's a... That's a trick.

18:19.114 --> 18:20.573
Do you know where we can find them?

18:20.673 --> 18:22.613
-[Shay] No, we're not doing that.
-[Sang] They're still here.

18:22.713 --> 18:24.653
-They're here?
-They're going from door to door.

18:24.753 --> 18:27.453
-OK, OK.
[women speak Vietnamese]

-[Shay] Lloyd!

18:39.551 --> 18:41.651
You guys are disgusting!
-[Shay] Oh, good.

18:41.751 --> 18:43.251
-[Lloyd] You're disgusting.

18:43.351 --> 18:44.571
-[Lloyd] You come in here
with your snake oil.

-[man] Piss off!
-[Lloyd] How do you live with yourself?!

18:46.351 --> 18:48.011
They're innocent, sick people.
You want to prey on them?

They don't care, dude.

18:50.870 --> 18:52.770
Hey...

18:52.870 --> 18:54.370
Let this be a lesson to you, my friend.

18:54.470 --> 18:56.470
Oi!

-Hey.

19:10.548 --> 19:12.208
Oh, are you OK?

19:12.308 --> 19:15.208
[Chesca] You and Dom are the only ones
who can get through to him.

19:15.308 --> 19:17.307
[Eadie] Where is he - in here?

19:20.107 --> 19:22.947
Hey, Cosmo, it's me, Eadie.

19:26.227 --> 19:28.226
Can you hear me?

19:28.986 --> 19:30.446
[Cosmo] Yes, I can hear you.

19:30.546 --> 19:32.546
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

19:34.426 --> 19:36.425
Right you are.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.765
How's it going in there?

19:40.865 --> 19:42.765
[Cosmo] It's messy.

19:42.865 --> 19:44.865
I've made a big mess.

19:45.784 --> 19:50.704
Well, you know the best thing about mess
is that you can clean it up.

19:55.263 --> 19:58.863
Hey, tell me, is it making you
feel better, in there?

19:59.863 --> 20:01.443
[Cosmo] Yeah.

20:01.543 --> 20:03.623
I'm having a shitty day.

20:05.262 --> 20:07.422
I wonder if I could come in there too.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.502
You could lock the door after me.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.501
And I promise I won't make you come out.

20:20.181 --> 20:22.181
[door latch clicks]

20:28.580 --> 20:30.580
[sobs]

20:42.339 --> 20:43.478
Hey.

20:43.578 --> 20:46.858
Are you really having a bad day
or was the just a ruse to get in here?

20:48.458 --> 20:51.858
I am really having a shitty day.

20:52.777 --> 20:55.257
Did your in vitro fertilisation
fail again?

20:56.497 --> 20:58.497
It did.

20:58.937 --> 21:00.937
And it might be the last one.

21:02.056 --> 21:04.056
Because of your advanced age?

21:05.736 --> 21:07.676
Yes.

21:07.776 --> 21:09.816
Because of my advanced age.

21:12.175 --> 21:14.075
But...

21:14.175 --> 21:16.655
my body has a bit of a kink.

21:17.655 --> 21:19.875
It isn't good at holding on to the babies.

21:19.975 --> 21:21.394
Have you considered that

21:21.494 --> 21:24.694
that could be a good outcome
rather than a bad one?

21:26.254 --> 21:28.074
Can't say that I have.

21:28.174 --> 21:31.633
Because your chances of having
someone like me

21:31.733 --> 21:33.733
is one in six.

21:34.573 --> 21:36.353
Is that supposed to scare me?

21:36.453 --> 21:39.793
It should.
Or at the very least, concern you.

21:39.893 --> 21:43.752
I heard Mum talking about you
trying to have a baby.

21:43.852 --> 21:45.852
And it scares her.

21:47.212 --> 21:51.951
The only thing that scares your mum is
you sitting in here with all this glass.

21:52.051 --> 21:54.591
-That's not true.
-Yes, true.

21:54.691 --> 21:56.771
She tries to hide it but I can see.

21:57.771 --> 21:59.071
What?

21:59.171 --> 22:00.670
I can see the effort required

22:00.770 --> 22:04.490
to pretend I'm anything other than
a massive, thankless task.

22:05.570 --> 22:08.190
When she sees other mothers
smiling at their children,

22:08.290 --> 22:10.549
I see how sad it makes her.

22:10.649 --> 22:12.509
And at night, she, Tillie and Sage

22:12.609 --> 22:15.309
complain about
how I get all the attention.

22:15.409 --> 22:19.408
I just see her want to scream and say
it's only because I don't work properly.

22:20.568 --> 22:21.828
And just once,

22:21.928 --> 22:24.928
she wants me to look her in the eyes
like a normal kid would do.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.807
Wow.

22:37.966 --> 22:42.206
I don't want to assume that you don't
have your own career plans, but...

22:43.246 --> 22:45.146
if you get stuck for ideas,

22:45.246 --> 22:48.245
I think you could make a killing
on the speaking circuit.

22:50.565 --> 22:52.565
TED spectrum.

22:53.845 --> 22:58.364
I'm available to be your booking agent
for a modest fee.

23:00.564 --> 23:03.144
But you probably can't do it from in here.

23:03.244 --> 23:04.704
[muffled through door]
[Dom] What triggered it?

23:04.804 --> 23:06.703
[Chesca] He was watching
the news conference about the storm

23:06.803 --> 23:08.303
when it was time to go
and he just got in this mood.

23:08.403 --> 23:09.783
[Dom] Why didn't you turn it off?
[knocking]

23:09.883 --> 23:11.383
[Chesca] I tried.
He kept turning it back on again.

23:11.483 --> 23:13.483
[Dom] Cos?

23:28.161 --> 23:30.161
Hey, buddy.

23:34.761 --> 23:37.040
I hear things got a bit bent out of shape.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.580
I know they're saying scary stuff
on the news.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.679
Are we in a coastal evacuation zone?

23:46.319 --> 23:48.319
We're safe.

23:49.639 --> 23:51.259
There's nothing to worry about.

23:51.359 --> 23:53.459
The people who designed this building
made it so strong.

23:53.559 --> 23:56.678
Strong enough to withstand storms
ten times bigger than this one.

24:00.598 --> 24:02.858
I'd never let anything happen to you.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.857
Or Mum.

24:04.957 --> 24:06.957
Or any of us.

24:07.557 --> 24:09.557
OK?

24:15.356 --> 24:19.716
Hey, Cos, you want to come in to work
with me for a bit?

24:24.275 --> 24:27.775
So, your first job, young man,

24:27.875 --> 24:31.015
is to administer some serious
first-aid to these plants.

24:31.115 --> 24:33.274
What purpose do they serve?

24:33.874 --> 24:35.134
Um...

24:35.234 --> 24:39.774
Well, on a practical level,
if they weren't fighting for life,

24:39.874 --> 24:43.933
they'd be bringing clean air into
this otherwise very stuffy environment.

24:44.033 --> 24:46.913
But I think they're also calming
for some of the patients.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.113
Hey...

24:51.712 --> 24:53.712
want to see inside your brain?

24:54.272 --> 24:56.272
How would I do that?

25:03.351 --> 25:05.011
What a beautiful brain you have.

25:05.111 --> 25:07.471
All the better to comprehend you with,
my dear.

25:09.111 --> 25:11.390
See, I don't get how you do that.

25:12.430 --> 25:15.850
I watch a lot of game shows. I just
like to think what they might say next.

25:15.950 --> 25:17.730
But news is the best.

25:17.830 --> 25:19.830
Yeah?

25:20.349 --> 25:22.369
Tell me something.

25:22.469 --> 25:26.529
I've seen you watch stuff
and I know faces are hard for you.

25:26.629 --> 25:28.689
But they don't seem to be hard on screen.

25:28.789 --> 25:30.808
Not as hard.

25:30.908 --> 25:32.908
But news is still the best.

25:33.748 --> 25:35.528
You just have to listen to the words.

25:35.628 --> 25:37.688
Doesn't matter if I know
what the face is saying.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.887
Just listen to the words.

25:39.987 --> 25:42.127
No guessing work involved.

25:42.227 --> 25:44.387
See this part of your brain?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.327
It goes into overdrive
when you ask it

25:47.427 --> 25:49.486
to recognise what's happening
on someone's face.

25:49.586 --> 25:52.646
It's a pretty intense feeling for you.

25:52.746 --> 25:55.186
It's stressful. That's why you look away.

25:56.186 --> 25:58.225
It's not 'cause I don't care.

25:59.145 --> 26:01.145
Of course not.

26:02.225 --> 26:06.425
But I might be able to make it
a bit less stressful.

26:08.504 --> 26:11.044
So, these look a bit strange.

26:11.144 --> 26:13.144
But I think you're gonna be impressed.

26:15.264 --> 26:18.143
You get to choose which animal I am.

26:18.863 --> 26:20.903
-Pig.
-Mmm, thanks.

26:21.823 --> 26:27.282
So, I'm gonna make a face
and you need to pick which one it is, OK?

26:27.382 --> 26:32.382
[gentle orchestral music]

26:35.302 --> 26:37.301
Good job.

26:40.901 --> 26:43.901
[gentle orchestral music continues]

26:45.061 --> 26:47.060
You're a natural.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.379
And the crowd goes wild.

26:59.459 --> 27:03.319
[gentle orchestral music continues]

27:03.419 --> 27:05.418
Last one.

27:07.898 --> 27:09.898
You got this.

27:18.257 --> 27:20.257
Perfect score.

27:22.977 --> 27:24.976
[message alert bleeps]

27:25.776 --> 27:27.436
Oh... your mum.

27:27.536 --> 27:29.856
She forgot you have
a dentist appointment.

27:36.215 --> 27:38.235
[Eadie] Hey.

27:38.335 --> 27:40.275
[Chesca] Ah, doctors Boulay and Boulay.

27:40.375 --> 27:44.074
Very important work this morning.
Sorry to see him go.

27:44.174 --> 27:46.114
I want to cook dinner tonight.

27:46.214 --> 27:48.694
At our house. For her birthday.

27:49.374 --> 27:52.554
OK. Sure you can.

27:52.654 --> 27:55.113
You can invite Lloyd and Ivy
if you'd like.

27:55.213 --> 27:57.793
Well, I'll see how they behave.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.753
If they act up this afternoon,
it'll just be me.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.312
Top work today.

28:02.412 --> 28:05.052
I can see you're sad
even though you're smiling.

28:07.892 --> 28:09.352
[Chesca] Shall we hit the road?

28:09.452 --> 28:11.452
Call you about tonight.

28:17.171 --> 28:18.591
Ow, ow, ow!

28:18.691 --> 28:21.670
-[woman] Stay still. Stay still.
-[Eadie] Hey, what happened?

28:21.770 --> 28:24.470
He single-handedly tried to take down
an entire fake vaccination racket.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.030
Really? Lloyd, you're such an idiot.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.830
Of course I didn't.
I didn't even land a blow.

28:28.930 --> 28:31.109
But he hammered them
with a piece of his mind.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.589
[Eadie] Ow.

28:32.689 --> 28:35.109
That's so beautifully tended to
by the gifted surgeon.

28:35.209 --> 28:37.869
He'll be left with only
the tiniest of manly scars.

28:37.969 --> 28:39.589
I can reschedule some stuff
and take you home.

28:39.689 --> 28:42.148
No, no, no. I need to go to work.
There's something I want to do.

28:42.248 --> 28:43.548
-Really?
-Yeah.

28:43.648 --> 28:46.108
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm OK.

28:46.208 --> 28:47.188
Really?

28:47.288 --> 28:49.628
-Look, I...
-OK, well...

28:49.728 --> 28:53.067
Cosmo's cooking dinner, so, if you're
up for it when the painkillers wear off,

28:53.167 --> 28:54.587
-meet me at...
-[laughs] OK.

28:54.687 --> 28:56.147
Are you sure you're gonna be OK?

28:56.247 --> 28:57.467
-I'm OK. I'm OK.
-Hold it.

28:57.567 --> 28:59.267
[Eadie] OK. You look great. [laughs]

28:59.367 --> 29:01.366
[Lloyd] Thank you.

29:02.926 --> 29:05.106
I've gotta pee.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.206
[doctor] OK, up.

29:12.245 --> 29:13.705
There's no progress.

29:13.805 --> 29:16.805
The guy I thought could do it
hasn't answered my calls yet.

29:18.725 --> 29:20.184
Well, do you know anyone else?

29:20.284 --> 29:21.904
Because I'm going to do this
either way, Shay.

29:22.004 --> 29:23.504
I'm actually trying to work

29:23.604 --> 29:25.584
and find someone to take
my national service days

29:25.684 --> 29:28.463
before they decide to fire me
at tomorrow's board meeting.

29:28.563 --> 29:31.063
I've got some other stuff
to deal with too.

29:31.163 --> 29:33.163
I'll take your days.

29:33.923 --> 29:35.583
What are you talking about?

29:35.683 --> 29:38.282
I'll take the national service days.
I'm happy to.

29:42.122 --> 29:44.802
Lloyd will never forgive me for this.

29:48.921 --> 29:52.361
If you want to take my days, take them.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.819
[reporter]<i> Evacuation order has moved</i>

31:44.989 --> 31:48.989
[ominous orchestral/electronic music]

31:56.388 --> 31:59.048
[Lloyd] So, I'm thinking about
Eadie's overactive immune system,

31:59.148 --> 32:01.407
the way that it attacks the embryo cells.

32:01.507 --> 32:04.367
And I'm thinking about
why the bugs don't catch Chagas,

32:04.467 --> 32:06.407
even though they're carrying the disease.

32:06.507 --> 32:10.846
Now, we know the bugs need a blood meal
every time they reproduce.

32:10.946 --> 32:14.086
And we know that that also causes
an immune activation.

32:14.186 --> 32:17.686
Enough immunity for them to be protected
from the disease in the first place.

32:17.786 --> 32:19.966
The ecdysone released from the ovaries.

32:20.066 --> 32:23.025
Yes, yes. But what if...

32:23.865 --> 32:27.685
What if the blood contained
a different message?

32:27.785 --> 32:31.804
What if instead of signalling
a spike in the immune system,

32:31.904 --> 32:34.064
it just turned it off completely?

32:39.983 --> 32:41.983
[bleeping]

32:50.782 --> 32:56.862
[tense electronic music builds]

33:04.221 --> 33:08.280
What I see... right here... right now

33:08.380 --> 33:10.780
is the beginning of the end of
the species, Lloyd.

33:14.220 --> 33:16.220
You did it, Lloyd.

33:18.659 --> 33:20.739
You did it.

33:23.739 --> 33:26.899
[gentle tinkling piano]

33:29.138 --> 33:31.498
-[Shay] You did it,
you beautiful bastard.

33:32.418 --> 33:34.998
-Mate...
-Mate!

33:35.098 --> 33:36.837
[weeps joyfully]

33:36.937 --> 33:39.037
Beautiful!

33:39.137 --> 33:41.477
-[Lloyd grunts]
-I love you!

33:41.577 --> 33:42.997
Come here!

33:43.097 --> 33:45.177
[both laugh]

33:47.936 --> 33:49.936
I think a little celebration's in order.

33:55.056 --> 33:58.475
[shouts] Lloyd Green, ladies
and gentlemen, you remember that name!

33:58.575 --> 34:00.555
Because he's a bloody genius.

34:00.655 --> 34:02.715
-But it's not...
-You're gonna be a rockstar.

34:02.815 --> 34:05.674
No, listen, we've been banging our heads
on this for, what? Ten years.

34:05.774 --> 34:07.594
-Ten years.
-Ten years.

34:07.694 --> 34:09.634
This is not me. This is us.

34:09.734 --> 34:11.594
Oh, bunkum.

34:11.694 --> 34:13.834
I'm a mere Sherpa
on your Everest conquest.

34:13.934 --> 34:16.333
-Sherpas do all of the work.
-Exactly.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.513
Oh! No, no, I've gotta go.
I've got to meet Eadie.

34:21.613 --> 34:23.613
Lloyd, for once, she can wait.

34:25.852 --> 34:27.852
Alright. Alright.

34:30.212 --> 34:31.712
[splutters]

34:31.812 --> 34:33.812
[laughs]

34:47.570 --> 34:49.390
[buzzing]

34:49.490 --> 34:51.950
-[woman] Eadie. Eadie Boulay?
-Yes.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.049
Come this way.

34:58.769 --> 35:01.809
[ominous atmospheric music]

35:28.206 --> 35:30.766
<i>-She's masked for 12 weeks.</i>
-OK.

35:33.965 --> 35:37.785
Cosmo's cooking dinner
for Eadie's birthday. You are invited.

35:37.885 --> 35:40.405
Yeah, I think I'll give that a miss.

35:41.204 --> 35:44.804
It's Eadie's birthday, mate.
She's gonna want you there. Let's go.

35:49.884 --> 35:52.883
[lightning cracks, thunder rumbles]

36:00.402 --> 36:03.782
[elevator PA]<i> Level 16.</i>

36:03.882 --> 36:06.322
[upbeat music, chatter]

36:07.002 --> 36:09.781
-[Dom] Cos, Cos, let's just have some...
just strawberries.

36:09.881 --> 36:13.141
Surprise! Sorry about our late
and slightly intoxicated entrance.

36:13.241 --> 36:15.461
Yes, my dear friend
just needed a few extra moments

36:15.561 --> 36:18.541
to test whether he had, in fact,
saved the world from Chagas disease...

36:18.641 --> 36:19.820
-What?
-No way.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.860
He's being too modest.
It's a team effort. Team effort, OK?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.500
-Are you serious?
-This is...

36:24.600 --> 36:27.420
This day is one brick in a house
we've been building for ten years.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.019
-[Eadie] Oh, my god!
-[Chesca] That's amazing!

36:29.119 --> 36:30.179
-Yeah.
-Congrats.

36:30.279 --> 36:31.619
[Shay] I was told there's food.
Is there food?

36:31.719 --> 36:33.619
-[Archie] Dad, can we have real food?
-[Chesca] There's a lot of food.

36:33.719 --> 36:35.139
-[Dom] Real food? What do you mean?

36:35.239 --> 36:37.839
We've got marshmallows and we've got
strawberries. What's better than that?

36:39.798 --> 36:44.178
[Lloyd] And instead of telling the bug
to create the super immune suit,

36:44.278 --> 36:45.978
it tells it the opposite.

36:46.078 --> 36:52.217
Within one generation, the Chagas
kills the kissing bug from the inside.

36:52.317 --> 36:55.037
No more babies.
Everything is right with the world.

36:57.317 --> 36:59.456
Wow. That's incredible.

36:59.556 --> 37:02.416
That is a particularly gross story
to be telling at the dinner table.

37:02.516 --> 37:03.976
You're talking about a vaccine, right?

37:04.076 --> 37:05.976
Not... Well, a vaccine of sorts.

37:06.076 --> 37:09.935
But the thing that this brilliant man
has worked out, the bonus is,

37:10.035 --> 37:11.855
if they are going to bite us,

37:11.955 --> 37:15.375
they take back with them
a time bomb from the blood.

37:15.475 --> 37:17.534
Can we stop talking about blood?

37:17.634 --> 37:19.214
[whispers] It's time
for a bit of screen time.

37:19.314 --> 37:21.574
You'll need a vaccine-like
delivery system, though, won't you?

37:21.674 --> 37:23.694
That's not really your realm.

37:23.794 --> 37:25.574
We'll partner up with the immunology team.

37:25.674 --> 37:27.253
-[Dom] How quickly do you think
you can get it up?

37:27.353 --> 37:29.253
We're a long way from human testing.

37:29.353 --> 37:31.893
We've got to do the second
generational testing first.

37:31.993 --> 37:36.132
And look, it's a long-game solution
but this is a massive step forward.

37:36.232 --> 37:37.612
[clattering]

37:37.712 --> 37:39.852
Hey, I'll get it.

37:39.952 --> 37:42.732
Baby, I'm sorry.
I didn't think about how that would sound.

37:42.832 --> 37:45.012
At least all that pain didn't go to waste,
eh?

37:45.112 --> 37:46.771
-[Chesca] Do you want some wine, Eadie?

37:46.871 --> 37:48.371
-Oh, no. No, I'm good, thanks.
-Sure?

37:48.471 --> 37:49.451
Yeah.

37:49.551 --> 37:51.451
[Archie] Did you get
any birthday presents?

37:51.551 --> 37:53.891
Uh, well, I...

37:53.991 --> 37:56.850
I got... national service for my birthday.

37:56.950 --> 37:58.770
[Lloyd] But we've got an exemption.

37:58.870 --> 38:00.850
I know. Go figure.

38:00.950 --> 38:02.850
-Don't worry, Eadie, I'll sort it out.
-No, it's fine.

38:02.950 --> 38:05.209
[Lloyd] You and Shay in two days -
what are the chances?

38:05.309 --> 38:07.209
No, I got someone to take
my national service days,

38:07.309 --> 38:09.969
so it's just Eadie in the hot seat,
I'm happy to say.

38:10.069 --> 38:11.809
-Who?
-Corrine.

38:11.909 --> 38:13.768
-[Dom] Seriously, Eadie...
-[Eadie] No, really, it's fine.

38:13.868 --> 38:16.408
-I'm actually kind of keen to do it.
-That's ridiculous.

38:16.508 --> 38:17.768
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

38:17.868 --> 38:19.208
-Dom...
-No-one in their right mind...

38:19.308 --> 38:21.828
Don't, Dom! Don't. Just leave it, OK?

38:28.347 --> 38:30.347
Sorry.

38:30.987 --> 38:32.287
Big few days.

38:32.387 --> 38:35.266
-Can I have those marshmallows?
-[Chesca] Yes, you definitely can.

38:37.626 --> 38:39.626
[lighting cracks aggressively]

38:41.266 --> 38:43.445
-[Archie] Your turn, Shay.
-[Sage] Wait, no, it's my turn.

38:43.545 --> 38:45.725
-[Lloyd] No, I think it's Sage's turn.
-[Archie] We're going this way.

38:45.825 --> 38:46.965
-We are?
-Yes.

38:47.065 --> 38:48.725
-Alright, it's OK.
-OK, OK.

38:48.825 --> 38:51.165
-Shay's go.
-[Lloyd] Shay, have a go, buddy.

38:51.265 --> 38:54.044
-[Chesca] You've had a go.
You need to swap...

38:54.144 --> 38:57.024
Ead?
[thunderclap]

39:02.903 --> 39:04.683
What's wrong?

39:04.783 --> 39:06.403
[Chesca] I don't think
Shay knows the rules.

39:06.503 --> 39:08.503
Um...

39:10.343 --> 39:12.782
I made a very bad choice.

39:14.142 --> 39:17.882
I had the last egg implanted
at an unregistered clinic.

39:17.982 --> 39:19.982
Lloyd doesn't know.

39:20.422 --> 39:22.601
Why haven't you told him?

39:22.701 --> 39:25.661
I'm taking immune suppressants
for the first trimester.

39:27.181 --> 39:31.220
Shay's redirecting my medical data
until we see if it takes or not.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.040
I'm doing his national service days
as a kind of...

39:35.140 --> 39:37.000
[Dom] Payment.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.280
[sighs]

39:38.380 --> 39:39.600
Penance.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.699
-[Cosmo] Hey, Eadie...

39:43.059 --> 39:45.499
I was wondering if we could
show them the glasses.

39:46.179 --> 39:47.919
Yeah, of course you can.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.018
Let's go.

39:51.818 --> 39:52.878
[thunderclap]

39:52.978 --> 39:54.758
[Eadie] Ready? OK? Alright?.

39:54.858 --> 39:57.478
-You got them? Comfortable?
-[Sage] He looks asleep to me.

39:57.578 --> 39:59.557
-OK, right. We are ready.
-Now pronounce you

39:59.657 --> 40:01.837
-king of Stone Hill.
-Uh, OK.

40:01.937 --> 40:03.397
Miss Piggy for me again.

40:03.497 --> 40:05.957
I don't think I need one for you anymore.

40:06.057 --> 40:07.557
-Good for you.
[large thunderclap]

40:07.657 --> 40:10.636
-[others] Whoa!
-Hey, hey. It's OK, Cos.

40:10.736 --> 40:12.716
We might just have to
have a giant sleepover.

40:12.816 --> 40:15.236
-[Dom] Looks like somebody already is.
-[Eadie chuckles]

40:15.336 --> 40:17.396
-I just wanted to say some things.
-[Archie] Let me take a photo!

40:17.496 --> 40:18.795
[Chesca] Archie, put that down, please.

40:18.895 --> 40:20.895
Cosmo wants to say something.
Girls, listening.

40:24.495 --> 40:29.254
Uh, this started off as being
a happy birthday speech for Aunty Eadie.

40:29.894 --> 40:31.894
Happy birthday, Aunty Eadie.

40:33.174 --> 40:37.113
But I also want to say some things
to other family members.

40:37.213 --> 40:41.893
Archie, Sage, Tillie...

40:44.533 --> 40:47.252
Dad and Mum...

40:51.092 --> 40:53.092
I just want to say, um...

40:53.892 --> 40:55.892
thank you for looking after me so much.

41:01.411 --> 41:03.931
That's it. That's what I want to say.

41:10.130 --> 41:12.130
I hope they're happy tears.

41:13.690 --> 41:16.209
Yep, happy tears.

41:17.209 --> 41:20.789
-[Archie] Is there cake?
-[Chesca] Yes, there's cake.

41:20.889 --> 41:22.469
What kind of a birthday
would it be without cake?

41:22.569 --> 41:24.389
[phone rings]
-You want some cake?

41:24.489 --> 41:26.508
Israel?

41:26.608 --> 41:28.028
-[Chesca] Thank you.

41:28.128 --> 41:29.548
No, no. I'll come down. Yeah.

41:29.648 --> 41:31.648
[lift bell dings]

41:40.527 --> 41:43.027
Jad, how's your daughter?

41:43.127 --> 41:44.426
She's gonna be fine.

41:44.526 --> 41:46.526
-Great.
-Thank you.

41:47.326 --> 41:49.326
We discussed your offer.

41:50.566 --> 41:53.106
And if you can come up a little, then...

41:53.206 --> 41:55.745
Look, I hear you. I really do.

41:55.845 --> 41:58.305
But I actually sought
a couple of second opinions,

41:58.405 --> 42:00.505
just to make sure that my numbers
weren't completely off

42:00.605 --> 42:05.044
and I'm afraid the flood rating
keeps your value cap pretty tight.

42:06.204 --> 42:10.884
OK. So your second opinions are telling
you my land's not worth a pinch of shit.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.963
Yeah?

42:14.683 --> 42:16.683
Why do you want it so much?

42:17.403 --> 42:19.403
The offer's fixed.

42:20.283 --> 42:22.702
If it works for you, take it.
If not, don't.

42:22.802 --> 42:25.082
There's no... pressure.

42:28.402 --> 42:30.402
[thunderclap]

42:31.042 --> 42:33.261
Look, I'd ask if you wanted to stay
until the storm's passed,

42:33.361 --> 42:35.581
but I'm sure you want to get
back to your family, so...

42:35.681 --> 42:37.681
I'll be in touch, yeah?

42:40.441 --> 42:42.440
This way, sir.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.140
-[Dom] Evening, Carl.

42:45.240 --> 42:49.320
-Dom. Bit rough out there tonight.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.539
Yeah, I'm sure the worst of it
will be through in a few hours.

42:52.639 --> 42:54.299
Yeah.

42:54.399 --> 42:56.399
[lift bell dings]

42:59.439 --> 43:01.518
I had an interesting conversation
this evening.

43:02.518 --> 43:06.238
My brother-in-law has had a breakthrough
with the Chagas vaccine.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.297
He had a courage bypass
at some point in his career.

43:10.397 --> 43:13.537
He was talking about
some slow, softly, softly approach.

43:13.637 --> 43:18.377
But in the right hands,
could be on the front line pretty fast.

43:18.477 --> 43:20.476
Hmm.

43:21.676 --> 43:23.736
Might be worth keeping an eye on.

43:23.836 --> 43:25.336
[lift bell dings]

43:25.436 --> 43:26.776
Absolutely.

43:26.876 --> 43:30.155
[thunderclap]

43:32.955 --> 43:37.275
