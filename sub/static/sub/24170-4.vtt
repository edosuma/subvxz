WEBVTT

00:01.980 --> 00:04.059
- Stay focused, ready...
- I said I've got it!

00:04.086 --> 00:04.953
You don't have to coach me.

00:04.988 --> 00:06.202
I can handle things with Jack myself.

00:06.226 --> 00:07.329
Do you just not want to get married?

00:07.353 --> 00:08.799
Do you not want to get married to me?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.044
I've never gotten that close before,

00:10.068 --> 00:11.602
knowing it could all be over.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.604
Prolonged smoke exposure,
so the airway's burning.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.838
Keep an eye on his lungs.

00:14.873 --> 00:16.139
- JJ. Are you okay?
- Seth died.

00:16.174 --> 00:17.207
I fought my way up,

00:17.242 --> 00:19.567
and I didn't have anything
handed to me by my daddy.

00:19.601 --> 00:21.188
She should've made
lead lieutenant years ago.

00:21.212 --> 00:23.247
Andy has earned her spot.

00:25.149 --> 00:27.985
<i>It doesn't actually take
that much to start a fire.</i>

00:28.019 --> 00:29.119
<i>You need three things.</i>

00:29.153 --> 00:31.688
<i>Heat, oxygen, and fuel.</i>

00:33.333 --> 00:34.625
<i>Lots of fuel.</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:36.331
We open tomorrow.

00:36.366 --> 00:38.098
Are you just gonna sit there
and drink wine

00:38.099 --> 00:39.128
and let me do all the work?

00:39.152 --> 00:41.135
I thought when your divorce was finalized

00:41.169 --> 00:42.570
and you said, "Sue, let's open up"

00:42.604 --> 00:44.705
this cute, little bed & breakfast,"

00:44.739 --> 00:47.141
there'd be a lot more bed
and a lot more breakfast.

00:47.175 --> 00:50.878
Would it kill you to help me
put this wine away in the racks?

00:50.912 --> 00:52.480
<i>And after that fire's started once...</i>

00:52.514 --> 00:54.448
In a minute.
I want to open another bottle.

00:54.483 --> 00:55.916
No. No. You're not!

00:55.951 --> 00:57.584
You are going to stock this wine,

00:57.585 --> 00:59.852
and I am going to bake
more welcome cookies

00:59.887 --> 01:03.441
for the B&B which you seem
to think will run itself.

01:03.476 --> 01:05.558
I swear, you are the worst sister.

01:05.593 --> 01:08.010
Literally the worst!

01:08.539 --> 01:11.197
<i>It needs even less
to catch fire again.</i>

01:13.475 --> 01:16.693
<i>Most people don't realize
that fire can reignite itself.</i>

01:19.630 --> 01:21.197
<i>All it takes is a fuel source.</i>

01:25.336 --> 01:29.039
<i>The teeny, tiniest flame, and, poof!</i>

01:29.073 --> 01:32.042
<i>The whole world can explode in your face.</i>

01:35.212 --> 01:37.647
You really did.

01:40.151 --> 01:42.218
I can't believe they would do that.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.806
Why is it every time I start my shift,

01:46.841 --> 01:49.132
I get slammed with a mountain
of surprises?

01:49.167 --> 01:50.407
- What surprises?
- New boots?

01:50.442 --> 01:52.068
You approved new boots?

01:52.069 --> 01:54.671
We needed some. Everybody wanted them.

01:54.705 --> 01:57.340
With midsole support
that decreases foot fatigue

01:57.375 --> 01:58.775
and a side zipper.

02:00.678 --> 02:01.290
It's...

02:01.324 --> 02:02.496
It's a big expense, Jack.

02:02.530 --> 02:05.015
The kind of decision
cocaptains might discuss

02:05.049 --> 02:06.276
and eventually cosign,

02:06.311 --> 02:07.559
unless one of the captains thought

02:07.583 --> 02:10.201
they no longer had to discuss
decisions with the other captain

02:10.235 --> 02:13.456
because he felt he was
somehow already captain.

02:13.491 --> 02:16.164
Just boots, Herrera. Just boots.

02:16.165 --> 02:17.733
I don't like to talk...

02:17.767 --> 02:19.278
You think we won't get the new boots now?

02:19.302 --> 02:20.936
No, new boots are not worth this.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.270
They've been bickering all week.

02:22.305 --> 02:24.072
Bishop, you speak "Herrera."

02:24.107 --> 02:25.455
Go make it stop.

02:25.489 --> 02:27.534
Well, she is tired of me interfering.

02:27.568 --> 02:29.311
She told me to back off. You were there.

02:30.658 --> 02:32.139
- I'm backing.
- No, don't back.

02:32.173 --> 02:34.294
- This is Bishop.
- Don't back. Backing is bad.

02:36.065 --> 02:37.005
No, I'm not getting in
the middle of that.

02:37.030 --> 02:37.998
Nah, I'm good. Mnhmnh.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.231
And not to mention the steak
dinner you served last shift.

02:40.255 --> 02:41.680
I now have to restock the pantry,

02:41.715 --> 02:42.936
probably with powdered milk.

02:42.970 --> 02:45.023
The team needed a pickmeup.

02:45.787 --> 02:47.921
- You're making this a whole deal.
- No deal.

02:47.956 --> 02:50.491
I just don't appreciate you
pulling these "Fun Dad" moves

02:50.525 --> 02:52.826
with the steaks and the boots
when we both know

02:52.861 --> 02:54.261
I have a bigger hill to climb here.

02:54.295 --> 02:55.863
- What hill?
- With Frankel!

02:55.897 --> 02:58.272
- I heard what she said to you, Jack.
- You did?

02:58.307 --> 03:00.605
She made it pretty clear
this was your race to lose.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.656
- I'm not going down without a fight.
- Did you hear me tell Frankel

03:02.680 --> 03:04.709
- that you'd make an excellent captain?
- You bet your ass I would.

03:04.733 --> 03:07.379
Or that you should have made
lieutenant a long time ago?

03:08.048 --> 03:09.515
I don't need you propping me up.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.484
I'm not propping you up, Andy. It's true.

03:11.518 --> 03:12.852
I can fight my own battles.

03:12.886 --> 03:14.654
- We all know that, Andy.
- Good!

03:14.688 --> 03:16.322
- I definitely know that.
- Okay.

03:16.357 --> 03:17.824
- Can you stop?
- Stop what?

03:17.858 --> 03:18.825
- Fighting!
- Yes.

03:18.859 --> 03:20.159
- Stop fighting.
- Yes.

03:20.194 --> 03:21.160
- You sure?
- Can you?

03:21.195 --> 03:23.296
- I can.
- I can, too.

03:54.017 --> 03:57.687
For a moment, I thought
I'd be upgrading these.

03:57.712 --> 04:01.014
A fleeting, beautiful moment.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.472
I need an opinion.

04:02.497 --> 04:04.498
And even when I polish them,
they're still so dull.

04:04.523 --> 04:06.343
Look at these.
Definitely seen better days.

04:06.344 --> 04:07.544
So, II got this friend

04:07.579 --> 04:09.513
who's sort of interested in somebody.

04:09.547 --> 04:11.058
But she just broke up with somebody else.

04:11.082 --> 04:12.226
Now, my friend wants to know...

04:12.250 --> 04:13.517
By "friend," do you mean you?

04:13.551 --> 04:15.113
And by "someone," do you mean JJ?

04:17.574 --> 04:18.689
Maybe.

04:18.723 --> 04:20.524
So, by "broke up," you mean died?

04:20.558 --> 04:22.726
What's the appropriate
waiting period on that?

04:22.761 --> 04:24.481
Do you think she needs time to...

04:24.515 --> 04:27.153
to get over her... you know.

04:27.187 --> 04:28.632
Her bangbuddy.

04:28.666 --> 04:30.834
- Her booty cutie.
- Never mind.

04:30.869 --> 04:32.369
- Sex amigo!
- Forget I asked.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.004
Asked what?

04:36.541 --> 04:38.152
I know many things
about many things, Miller.

04:38.176 --> 04:40.711
Hazmat indicators,
disaster response team,

04:40.745 --> 04:41.945
containment initiatives...

04:41.980 --> 04:46.183
a wealth of knowledge sitting
at reception all day, every day.

04:46.217 --> 04:48.185
So, how can I help?
What did you want to know?

04:49.687 --> 04:51.255
Basically, he wants to get laid.

04:57.762 --> 04:59.866
SSir?

05:04.436 --> 05:05.880
So, the trick is to find the center point

05:05.904 --> 05:07.915
and hang the lines so they dry
evenly and don't mildew.

05:07.939 --> 05:09.373
You think that once we finish here,

05:09.407 --> 05:12.843
we could take a break and, go try

05:12.877 --> 05:13.844
the VR Fire Simulation Goggles

05:13.878 --> 05:15.034
that Jack got?

05:15.068 --> 05:16.613
This is not an amusement park, Warren.

05:16.648 --> 05:18.415
You're training here. Stay on task.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.894
It could also be part of my training.

05:19.918 --> 05:21.752
The... The graphics
are supposed to be so real

05:21.786 --> 05:23.353
that it feels like physical heat.

05:23.388 --> 05:25.132
Are you asking me
to run extra drills with you,

05:25.156 --> 05:27.558
voluntarily, in a video game?

05:27.592 --> 05:31.028
More like a completely
immersive training experience,

05:31.062 --> 05:33.464
but, um, yeah.

05:34.666 --> 05:35.966
Absolutely not.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.302
This is exactly the opposite

05:38.336 --> 05:40.037
of how I thought today was gonna go.

05:40.071 --> 05:41.705
You and me both.

05:41.739 --> 05:42.739
Not complaining.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.408
And it beats fighting.

05:44.442 --> 05:45.586
Finally, something we can agree on.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.544
Maybe we should... talk about this?

05:47.579 --> 05:48.545
Absolutely.

05:48.580 --> 05:49.623
- Maybe later?
- Not right now.

05:49.647 --> 05:51.582
- Okay.
- You leave first

05:51.616 --> 05:54.585
and, um, just slam the door
like you're mad.

05:54.619 --> 05:56.153
Copy.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.164
Warren. Think fast!

06:07.198 --> 06:09.566
Hughes! Comin' your way!

06:09.601 --> 06:10.834
Okay.

06:10.869 --> 06:12.803
Okay, what happened?

06:12.837 --> 06:15.239
You were not this earlier.

06:15.273 --> 06:17.641
This morning, you were all and.

06:17.675 --> 06:20.206
And now...

06:20.240 --> 06:21.645
Was it Jack?

06:21.679 --> 06:22.756
Did he do this to you?

06:22.790 --> 06:24.581
What?

06:24.616 --> 06:26.283
No.

06:26.317 --> 06:28.252
Did he mess up the captain race?

06:28.286 --> 06:29.319
Did he piss Frankel off?

06:29.354 --> 06:30.831
Come on. I want to hear all about it.

06:30.855 --> 06:33.590
- Deets. Go.
- Look, Corn on sale.

06:33.625 --> 06:38.028
Now, II believe
it's my turn to cook today,

06:38.062 --> 06:40.831
in which case,
I vote we splurge on these.

06:40.865 --> 06:42.766
I make a mean truffle risotto.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.767
Can't splurge.

06:43.801 --> 06:44.991
- Not after Gibson...
- No. No.

06:45.015 --> 06:47.004
Went big on steaks
during his last shift.

06:47.038 --> 06:49.039
We're dipping into reserves.

06:49.073 --> 06:52.075
- Put it back.
- Less risotto, more RiceARoni.

06:53.311 --> 06:55.623
This morning, you were ripping
Jack a new one about spending.

06:55.647 --> 06:56.713
Now you don't say a word.

06:56.748 --> 06:58.682
Vic's right. Something's up.

06:58.716 --> 07:00.517
What gives?

07:00.552 --> 07:02.948
Right. Not my race.

07:03.755 --> 07:04.788
Stay in my lane.

07:04.822 --> 07:06.957
- Forget I brought it up.
- No, Maya, it's not what...

07:11.029 --> 07:13.697
We have full response needed.
479 Sunken Meadow Road.

07:20.705 --> 07:22.025
Hey, we're coming back for those!

07:33.685 --> 07:36.820
All right. Grab an extra fold of hose.

07:36.854 --> 07:39.690
Enough to make some curves and
avoid getting kinks in the line.

07:39.724 --> 07:41.758
It's Gibson. We're here.

07:46.217 --> 07:48.055
Who actually stays at a place like this?

07:48.089 --> 07:50.016
I honeymooned in a place like this.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.868
You would.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.847
Clear!

07:57.881 --> 07:59.716
Don't overcrank that coupling there.

08:01.719 --> 08:03.686
Ready when you are, 19.

08:04.855 --> 08:05.822
So, the oven lit up?

08:05.856 --> 08:07.056
Huge flames shot out,

08:07.091 --> 08:08.191
and my mitt caught on fire.

08:08.225 --> 08:09.692
And then you threw the mitt,

08:09.727 --> 08:11.412
which made the flames even crazier,

08:11.447 --> 08:12.747
instead of putting the mitt in the sink

08:12.771 --> 08:13.923
like a normal person would.

08:13.957 --> 08:16.596
It's a normal reaction to giant
flames shooting at my face.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.131
Giant flames. Okay. Is anyone inside?

08:18.166 --> 08:20.233
No, no. Our first guests arrive tomorrow.

08:20.268 --> 08:21.635
It's the grand opening.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.336
Everything we have is in there.

08:23.371 --> 08:25.215
Let's get eyes on this. Looks
like a working structure fire.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.307
Structure fire. My God,
it's a structure fire!

08:27.341 --> 08:29.489
Montgomery, Miller,
run a hose line inside.

08:29.523 --> 08:31.478
- Got it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:31.512 --> 08:33.509
Sir, we just completed our renovation,

08:33.510 --> 08:35.510
and every dime we have is in this place.

08:35.544 --> 08:38.980
Could you please avoid
using axes... and water?

08:39.014 --> 08:42.817
You want us to avoid
using water on a fire.

08:42.852 --> 08:44.447
Yes.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.755
Gibson, secure the lines.
We'll see you inside.

08:57.566 --> 08:59.367
Line's secure.

08:59.401 --> 09:00.443
Damn it, damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it, damn it!

09:00.467 --> 09:01.813
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:01.837 --> 09:02.745
Don't! Don't!

09:02.780 --> 09:05.474
Do you not see your
neighbor's house is on fire?!

09:05.508 --> 09:07.335
Charge it up!

09:12.795 --> 09:14.529
- Did they hear us?
- We're losing time.

09:14.563 --> 09:15.930
Hughes, Warren, do you copy?

09:15.965 --> 09:17.766
Copy. The line's been compromised.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.240
We need to run a new line right now.

09:19.869 --> 09:21.936
Team in there's dry.

09:21.971 --> 09:23.682
We've still got a water can
and an extinguisher.

09:23.706 --> 09:25.740
We'll use those. Be careful in there!

09:25.775 --> 09:28.386
We have limited resources,
so don't get sprayhappy.

09:28.387 --> 09:30.154
If flames are too big,
we don't grandstand.

09:30.189 --> 09:31.189
We get out.

09:45.804 --> 09:47.905
I've seen campfires that were bigger.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.668
Flag on that hose line, guys. Fire's out.

09:53.412 --> 09:54.712
They're lucky it was a fire

09:54.747 --> 09:55.985
we could put out in one blast, Gibson.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.362
- So are you.
- Excuse me?

09:57.396 --> 09:59.141
I told you to secure the line.

09:59.175 --> 10:01.673
That was your job. You were
on truck to protect the hose.

10:01.707 --> 10:03.567
You're saying a popped line is my fault?

10:03.601 --> 10:05.553
I'm saying you thought
it was handled, and it wasn't.

10:05.577 --> 10:08.259
Don't blame me for something
I can't control.

10:10.082 --> 10:11.367
You think they bought it?

10:11.368 --> 10:12.859
You were very convincing.

10:12.893 --> 10:16.238
Well, II guess I've had
a little practice lately.

10:16.273 --> 10:17.273
We both have.

10:18.742 --> 10:19.786
Think they're still out there listening?

10:19.810 --> 10:21.388
Probably.

10:21.389 --> 10:24.024
Being captain doesn't
always make you right!

10:24.058 --> 10:25.225
How was that?

10:25.260 --> 10:26.393
That's pretty good.

10:26.427 --> 10:29.363
It's not about being right.
It's about doing what's right!

10:29.397 --> 10:30.364
Nice.

10:30.398 --> 10:33.500
I promise you I'll do
what needs to be done.

10:33.534 --> 10:35.569
Really?

10:35.603 --> 10:37.070
Yeah.

10:37.105 --> 10:39.006
Really?! You think so?

10:39.040 --> 10:40.407
I know so.

10:57.727 --> 10:59.728
I miss the sneaking around.

10:59.763 --> 11:01.997
It was fun.

11:02.032 --> 11:03.999
Simpler times.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.344
We were living our life in a bubble.

11:05.368 --> 11:08.437
A secret, little, sexy bubble.

11:09.606 --> 11:10.929
We can go back to that.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.389
Sure, okay.

11:12.424 --> 11:13.782
Let's think about it.

11:14.402 --> 11:16.536
Once this race is over
and one of us wins,

11:16.571 --> 11:18.872
it'll be different between us.

11:18.906 --> 11:20.107
No matter what.

11:20.141 --> 11:21.942
You mean we have an expiration date?

11:21.976 --> 11:23.610
These are our last days on Earth.

11:23.645 --> 11:24.845
How do you want to spend them?

11:24.879 --> 11:25.846
Fighting, or...

11:25.880 --> 11:28.296
Or in a sexy bubble?

11:30.652 --> 11:34.115
<i>Aid 19, victim in
distress, Hazelton Place.</i>

11:34.150 --> 11:36.056
Aid car. Not us.

11:46.517 --> 11:47.584
Edith.

11:47.618 --> 11:49.463
Same shoulder as last time?

11:49.497 --> 11:50.843
Yep.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.793
I'm ready. Pop it back in.

11:52.794 --> 11:54.928
I am worried
about why this keeps happening.

11:54.963 --> 11:57.097
It's the fourth fall
you've had in the last month.

11:57.131 --> 11:59.733
I'm a dizzy dame.

12:04.459 --> 12:07.961
Did you go to the doctor, like
we discussed, about your tremor?

12:07.996 --> 12:09.902
It's a tic, not a tremor.

12:09.927 --> 12:11.327
And I'm perfectly fine.

12:11.352 --> 12:12.920
So, are you gonna do this,

12:13.134 --> 12:15.736
or do I have to call
some different paramedics?

12:15.770 --> 12:18.136
We should take you to the
hospital for something like this.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.938
No way, honey.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.273
People my age who go to the hospital...

12:22.308 --> 12:24.108
They go in, they never come out.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.176
I'm staying put.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.886
Can't we at least give
you something for the pain?

12:26.910 --> 12:29.023
No, doesn't help. Makes me queasy.

12:29.057 --> 12:31.015
Let's just get to it, okay?

12:32.618 --> 12:33.798
I would like to state,

12:33.833 --> 12:36.729
for the record, that I am
advising you against this.

12:36.754 --> 12:38.989
Montgomery, they have
Parcheesi in the lounge

12:39.014 --> 12:40.715
in 20 minutes, okay?

12:42.733 --> 12:44.534
On three. One, two...

12:44.559 --> 12:45.826
Aah!

12:47.272 --> 12:50.441
Good God, holy hell!

12:54.494 --> 12:55.854
Well, I guess that'll wake you up.

12:56.182 --> 12:58.417
Okay. You're a badass.

12:58.442 --> 13:00.376
She's a badass.

13:07.205 --> 13:08.367
Sure.

13:08.392 --> 13:09.747
She gives me a hard time,

13:09.772 --> 13:11.473
then she goes
and tries it out for herself.

13:28.956 --> 13:30.255
You okay?

13:30.289 --> 13:32.792
Yeah, of course. It's just a game.

13:32.826 --> 13:34.791
It must be pretty intense. I mean,
you want some water or some...

13:34.815 --> 13:36.028
Yeah, no, I told you I'm fine.

13:36.062 --> 13:37.243
All right, if you need some help,

13:37.267 --> 13:38.490
I know some tricks to bring that BP down.

13:38.514 --> 13:39.804
No, I'm not your patient, Warren!

13:39.828 --> 13:42.702
You're my rookie. I don't need your help.

13:57.552 --> 13:58.552
Miller.

13:58.586 --> 14:00.620
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression.

14:00.655 --> 14:03.089
I would never use my status as
a firefighter to my advantage.

14:03.124 --> 14:04.481
Heavens. No.

14:04.516 --> 14:06.640
- I'm not just trying to get laid.
- Okay.

14:06.641 --> 14:09.510
But you do know things.

14:09.544 --> 14:12.546
You've lived... a lot longer
than anyone else here.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.550
Actually, longer than any of us
here expect to live.

14:16.584 --> 14:19.286
Thank you, Miller, for pointing
out my impending mortality.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.421
Always appreciated.

14:20.455 --> 14:22.423
I respect your advice.

14:22.457 --> 14:25.259
And the other guys, they make
a joke, but I'm serious.

14:25.293 --> 14:27.594
II want to stay
respectful to this person

14:27.629 --> 14:28.258
and also let her know

14:28.259 --> 14:30.359
that I want to take her out on a date.

14:30.393 --> 14:32.628
And I usually don't have this trouble.

14:32.662 --> 14:36.031
You know, II save a cat
or a dog or a laptop,

14:36.066 --> 14:39.735
and... the rest is like
a selfcleaning oven.

14:39.769 --> 14:42.805
You know, it just takes care of itself.

14:44.841 --> 14:45.841
Okay.

14:45.876 --> 14:48.288
Look, this... this...
this is different, sir.

14:48.289 --> 14:49.923
Th... This is new for me.

14:49.957 --> 14:50.957
Miller.

14:50.992 --> 14:53.860
Have you and I ever spoken
about your private life?

14:53.895 --> 14:55.729
No. Not... Not really.

14:55.763 --> 14:58.265
Has it ever been my business
where you put your business?

14:58.299 --> 15:00.100
No.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.003
Let's not start now.

15:06.674 --> 15:08.708
You need to wear the sling
for 12 more days.

15:08.743 --> 15:09.904
No heavy lifting,

15:09.905 --> 15:12.106
and watch out for swelling, okay?

15:12.140 --> 15:13.508
And where are we with the new bed

15:13.542 --> 15:15.510
that your grandson was gonna get you?

15:15.544 --> 15:17.845
He's too busy to worry
about waiting on me.

15:19.381 --> 15:21.195
He didn't order it for you, did he?

15:22.184 --> 15:24.485
You need a bed that adjusts.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.098
The next time you fall, you could
fall on your head or your hip.

15:27.099 --> 15:28.599
He's the one taking care of you.

15:28.634 --> 15:30.074
He needs to be on top of this stuff.

15:30.102 --> 15:31.068
Please.

15:31.103 --> 15:32.169
Edith.

15:32.204 --> 15:34.572
I understand he's your grandson.

15:34.606 --> 15:36.907
I have concerns, okay?

15:36.942 --> 15:38.509
He can't just neglect your needs.

15:38.543 --> 15:40.478
I'll speak to the facilities manager.

15:40.512 --> 15:42.280
For God's sake, Montgomery,

15:42.314 --> 15:43.876
I didn't tell him about the bed,

15:43.877 --> 15:45.778
and I didn't tell him about my symptoms.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.381
If he cares about you,
he'll want to know.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.850
Listen, he's finally working.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.686
He comes to visit, sits in that chair,

15:54.721 --> 15:57.689
and tells me how happy he is.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.925
Now, I don't want him worrying about me.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.762
And I will not have him
scrapping his future

16:03.796 --> 16:05.497
to prolong mine.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.216
No, thank you.

16:08.378 --> 16:11.414
My husband died of Parkinson's.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.583
We tried everything, and it took years.

16:14.618 --> 16:17.720
Now, I know what's happening to me,

16:17.754 --> 16:19.733
and I don't need to draw it out.

16:19.768 --> 16:21.575
He's your family. You should tell him.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.060
You should mind your damn business.

16:26.201 --> 16:29.765
Nice meeting you today, dear.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.778
You can leave now.

16:35.105 --> 16:37.752
It's nice in the bubble.

16:37.787 --> 16:39.208
It is.

16:39.242 --> 16:40.815
We can't fall asleep.

16:40.816 --> 16:42.819
Two more minutes, and then you go.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.753
Unless I stayed?

16:45.787 --> 16:46.854
You can't do that.

16:46.888 --> 16:48.622
Then people would know.

16:48.657 --> 16:51.258
Is that the worst thing?

16:51.293 --> 16:53.694
Yes. You know it's against the rules.

16:53.728 --> 16:55.262
Your dad's rules.

16:55.297 --> 16:58.766
And your dad's not captain anymore.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.202
Technically, we should
be making our own rules...

17:01.236 --> 17:03.103
Well, it's definitely frowned upon.

17:03.138 --> 17:05.229
Frankel would flip.

17:05.230 --> 17:06.931
The station... God.

17:06.964 --> 17:08.098
What would everyone think?

17:08.133 --> 17:10.034
No. Nobody can find out.

17:10.068 --> 17:11.969
I kind of assumed Maya already knew.

17:12.003 --> 17:14.372
About before. Not about today.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.973
And I don't know.

17:16.008 --> 17:17.942
If... If we keep it to ourselves,

17:17.976 --> 17:19.998
nobody gets to have an opinion.

17:20.031 --> 17:21.378
No one can judge.

17:21.413 --> 17:25.148
Plus, if people find out,
then my dad'll find out, and...

17:25.183 --> 17:26.739
Yeah, okay, all right.

17:26.772 --> 17:28.822
You're right.

17:28.856 --> 17:29.889
You're right.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.317
Two minutes. I'm gone.

17:37.494 --> 17:40.262
I kind of liked that
Bed & Breakfast place today.

17:41.525 --> 17:43.509
Maybe we could go there sometime.

17:44.985 --> 17:47.066
Take our bubble on the road.

17:48.672 --> 17:50.039
Once they fix the kitchen.

17:51.341 --> 17:54.610
- Obviously.
- That's not really my style.

17:54.644 --> 17:56.312
- No?
- Mnhmnh.

17:56.346 --> 17:58.647
- What is?
- I don't know.

17:58.682 --> 18:00.479
Never given it much thought.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.686
I think about it all the time...

18:04.558 --> 18:06.359
what I want my home to be one day.

18:08.310 --> 18:10.311
Which is strange, I know,

18:10.336 --> 18:14.739
considering I also know how
quickly it can all burn down.

18:19.869 --> 18:23.669
What's gonna happen, Andy? With us?

18:25.302 --> 18:28.304
And once Frankel chooses a captain,

18:28.329 --> 18:31.344
if one of us is really in charge
and the other isn't...

18:33.297 --> 18:35.965
will we be okay with that?

18:35.990 --> 18:40.660
Or... do you think
it has to burn us down?

18:54.337 --> 18:55.939
I know we can't tell her grandson,

18:55.964 --> 18:57.898
but I wish we could find a way.

18:57.933 --> 19:00.167
Her symptoms are advancing quickly.
The tremors?

19:00.202 --> 19:01.802
And if her pharynx stops working,

19:01.837 --> 19:03.671
she could lose control of her esophagus.

19:03.705 --> 19:05.116
One bad swallow, we're not being called

19:05.140 --> 19:06.774
for dislocated shoulder, okay?

19:06.808 --> 19:10.216
She'll be choking to death,
and we'll be too late.

19:10.329 --> 19:11.774
Okay, you've been on your phone
the entire ride.

19:11.798 --> 19:13.465
Have you heard a single word I've said?

19:13.499 --> 19:16.468
Yup. Granny. Secrets. Bad.
Couldn't agree more.

19:16.502 --> 19:18.303
No, really. I agree.

19:18.337 --> 19:20.439
When you are going
through something this big

19:20.473 --> 19:21.784
and you have people around you who care,

19:21.808 --> 19:24.709
you should be able to let them in.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.551
Exactly.

19:45.569 --> 19:47.791
- Ooh!
- I mean, we had skills labs for surgery,

19:47.826 --> 19:49.584
but nothing as realistic as this.

19:49.585 --> 19:51.052
Great for you.

19:51.086 --> 19:52.253
Whoo! You like that?!

19:52.287 --> 19:53.588
- Yeah!
- So, you...

19:53.622 --> 19:55.133
you really feel.
Like you're inside the fire?

19:55.157 --> 19:56.357
Yeah. Superreal.

19:56.391 --> 19:58.603
When you were using this thing
earlier, you were feeling it.

19:58.627 --> 20:00.595
- You were sweating.
- Really?

20:00.629 --> 20:01.529
Warren, quit distracting me. All right?

20:01.563 --> 20:03.631
I just can't wait
to try this baby out

20:03.665 --> 20:06.067
and feel all that damn fire on my face!

20:06.101 --> 20:09.637
Whoo! Deano wins!

20:09.671 --> 20:11.172
Have any of you seen Andy?

20:11.206 --> 20:12.338
I thought she was with you.

20:12.373 --> 20:13.952
Yeah, she, She was
in the office doing paperwork.

20:13.976 --> 20:15.228
I have to head out real quick.

20:15.263 --> 20:16.615
I just wanted to let her know.

20:17.546 --> 20:19.444
Is everything okay?

20:19.445 --> 20:22.781
Yeah, totally. Back soon.

20:26.953 --> 20:29.588
It's me. I can't stay long.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.214
I'm on my way.

20:49.430 --> 20:50.823
Maya Bishop's here.

21:03.570 --> 21:05.704
I wanted to get here sooner,
but I'm on call,

21:05.739 --> 21:07.806
and we're not supposed
to leave during shift.

21:17.650 --> 21:18.951
Just take your time.

21:26.358 --> 21:29.794
That's him. That's... definitely him.

21:29.828 --> 21:31.588
I saw his name,
and he looks just like you.

21:32.527 --> 21:33.733
So I tracked down your number and called.

21:33.754 --> 21:35.088
I hope I wasn't overstepping.

21:35.122 --> 21:36.923
If it were my family, I'd want to know.

21:36.957 --> 21:38.958
He's thinner. Did he ask for me?

21:38.993 --> 21:40.693
He's been sleeping it off.

21:40.728 --> 21:42.729
And he was shoplifting for food, or...?

21:42.763 --> 21:44.697
Actually, no. Art supplies.

21:44.732 --> 21:46.916
He had about 20 tubes of paint
stuffed in his pants.

21:48.068 --> 21:50.280
The owner's not pressing charges.
Figured I'd hold him here tonight,

21:50.304 --> 21:51.902
- let him go in the morning.
- You'd do that?

21:51.926 --> 21:53.065
He wasn't hurting anybody.

21:53.099 --> 21:55.726
I recognize him from my patrols.
He lives on the street.

21:57.062 --> 21:58.295
No.

21:58.330 --> 22:01.365
No, he's...

22:01.400 --> 22:03.868
My brother likes
to keep to himself, sure.

22:03.902 --> 22:06.470
He, he hasn't made
the best choices.

22:06.505 --> 22:08.227
He's fine. He's not homeless.

22:08.228 --> 22:09.672
Well, when's the last time
you spoke to him?

22:09.696 --> 22:10.896
A year. Maybe more.

22:10.931 --> 22:12.865
A lot can happen in a year.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.825
I need to... II... He can live with me.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.046
- I can help him.
- Not when he's like this.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.848
You won't even be able
to hold a conversation.

22:18.872 --> 22:21.007
- Ryan, it's my brother.
- He's safe for now.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.685
I know you need
to get back to the station.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.383
I just...

22:24.384 --> 22:26.152
I just thought you should know.

22:26.186 --> 22:27.453
All right.

22:31.158 --> 22:32.458
Thank you.

23:22.962 --> 23:25.096
<i>Station 19, response.</i>

23:25.130 --> 23:26.230
<i>Fire alarm.</i>

23:26.265 --> 23:27.640
Okay.

23:27.641 --> 23:29.609
<i>- Station 19, response.
- Okay.</i>

23:29.643 --> 23:31.277
- Okay, okay, okay.
<i>- Fire alarm.</i>

23:51.709 --> 23:53.810
I tried to find you last night.

23:53.844 --> 23:54.978
You weren't anywhere.

23:55.012 --> 23:56.045
Guess you crashed early?

23:56.080 --> 23:57.046
Yeah.

23:57.081 --> 23:58.481
Well, that's not like you.

23:59.883 --> 24:01.328
Anything you want to talk about there?

24:01.352 --> 24:03.586
Why were you trying to find me?

24:03.621 --> 24:05.395
Just had to take off for a bit.

24:05.396 --> 24:06.396
During shift?

24:07.265 --> 24:09.666
Anything <i>you</i> want to talk about there?

24:09.700 --> 24:11.401
Are you asking as my friend or my boss?

24:11.435 --> 24:13.952
I'm just... asking.

24:14.889 --> 24:16.789
Nothing to talk about.

24:28.636 --> 24:31.271
Ladies, please.
Let's get out of the street.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.181
Okay, guys, we've been here before.

24:37.215 --> 24:39.183
Smoke's centered in the rear Delta side.

24:39.217 --> 24:41.294
That's where the kitchen is.
Any sign of the sisters?

24:41.318 --> 24:42.819
- No sign.
- It's early.

24:42.854 --> 24:44.498
They were probably sound asleep
when the fire broke out.

24:44.522 --> 24:45.422
They may have no idea.

24:45.456 --> 24:48.002
Between the smoke and the carbon
monoxide, they may be unconscious.

24:48.026 --> 24:49.793
Okay, Hughes, Warren. Search and rescue.

24:49.827 --> 24:50.994
Get in there and find them.

24:51.029 --> 24:52.563
The rest of us are hitting
this thing from the inside out.

24:52.564 --> 24:54.398
Let's run two lines...
primary and secondary.

24:54.432 --> 24:55.266
Montgomery, be ready.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.368
No telling how long they've been down.

24:57.402 --> 24:59.303
Guy, guys, get to the door.

24:59.337 --> 25:00.437
There's one of the sisters.

25:00.472 --> 25:02.439
Help.

25:02.474 --> 25:04.208
Get a gurney over here!

25:04.242 --> 25:07.311
Wait!

25:07.345 --> 25:09.446
Sue, Sue, do you know
where your sister is?

25:09.481 --> 25:10.447
Is she still inside?

25:10.482 --> 25:13.031
I was looking for her.
There's so much smoke.

25:13.065 --> 25:14.185
She's not in her bed!

25:14.219 --> 25:16.086
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.

25:16.121 --> 25:17.454
Go!

25:23.992 --> 25:25.392
Clear!

25:25.427 --> 25:27.828
Clear! No sign of her yet.

25:39.464 --> 25:40.932
We can't see anybody from here.

25:40.966 --> 25:42.066
Maybe behind that island.

25:44.036 --> 25:47.071
We're not gonna get anyone out of
here until we've put this fire out.

25:47.105 --> 25:48.673
Upstairs is clear.

25:48.707 --> 25:50.308
Deborah's not up here.

25:50.342 --> 25:52.572
All right, hustle down,
and continue primary search.

25:52.573 --> 25:53.784
We've got to knock down this kitchen fire

25:53.808 --> 25:55.319
before it extends to the second floor.

25:55.343 --> 25:56.877
Copy that. On the move.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.747
Hit it!

26:07.989 --> 26:08.655
Stubborn one.

26:08.690 --> 26:10.590
It ain't no ovenmitt fire.

26:10.625 --> 26:12.793
Come on. Come on.

26:21.696 --> 26:23.230
Fire's out.

26:24.809 --> 26:27.444
Come on, Warren. I know
she's in here somewhere.

26:32.038 --> 26:34.173
Listen carefully. Listen for a cry.

26:34.198 --> 26:36.099
It's hard to hear over everything!

26:41.328 --> 26:43.329
- Deborah!
- Deborah!

26:43.354 --> 26:45.388
Deborah! Maybe she's in here.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.840
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa. What the hell?!

26:49.865 --> 26:52.233
We got a reignition in here!

26:55.780 --> 26:56.880
Hughes?

26:56.905 --> 26:59.573
Vic!

26:59.598 --> 27:02.035
Vic!

27:02.060 --> 27:03.261
Recharge the line!

27:03.286 --> 27:05.254
Get some more water pumping in here!

27:08.039 --> 27:09.775
We're gonna get out of here!
We're off bottle!

27:09.799 --> 27:12.567
- Hit it again. Hit it again.
- Aah!

27:36.664 --> 27:37.765
What happened? Is she okay?

27:37.799 --> 27:40.040
I don't know. Fire just
started up again out of nowhere.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.576
I may have burned my ear a little.

27:41.610 --> 27:42.977
Yeah, it's a little red.

27:43.011 --> 27:44.212
Let's get some ointment on it.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.390
Warren, what about you? You okay?

27:45.414 --> 27:47.181
Fine. Yeah, just fine.

27:47.216 --> 27:48.816
Have they found my sister yet?

27:48.851 --> 27:50.695
Sue, please keep breathing
into your mask, okay?

27:50.719 --> 27:52.086
You inhaled a lot of smoke.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.721
My sister is in there!

27:53.755 --> 27:55.356
Why haven't they found her?!

27:55.390 --> 27:57.825
What was that?!

27:57.860 --> 27:58.993
What the hell was that?

27:59.027 --> 28:01.362
Something's exploding.

28:01.396 --> 28:03.331
She's behind those doors.
Deborah! Don't move!

28:03.365 --> 28:04.332
We'll come get you!

28:04.366 --> 28:06.000
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

28:06.034 --> 28:08.266
You saw that fire came back.
Something's still fueling it.

28:08.267 --> 28:10.227
So it'll keep coming back
until we cut the source.

28:11.670 --> 28:14.071
We have to risk it.
We've got to get to her.

28:16.675 --> 28:18.109
Aah!

28:20.312 --> 28:22.468
Aah! Aah! Aah!

28:22.469 --> 28:23.770
The heat's making the bottles...

28:23.804 --> 28:24.947
do that.

28:24.982 --> 28:27.974
I'm gonna die!
Get me out of here, please!

28:28.008 --> 28:30.009
It's like an entire wall of dirty bombs

28:30.043 --> 28:31.644
between me and our rescue.

28:31.678 --> 28:33.846
Glass at that force,
it'll cut through your turnout.

28:33.881 --> 28:36.182
It has to be the gas line
to the stove that's still open.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.250
We got to find it.

28:37.284 --> 28:38.584
I'll go knock out the valve.

28:38.619 --> 28:40.027
All right. I'll go in there and get her.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.734
Miller, follow him with that line

28:41.768 --> 28:43.427
in case the fire comes back.

28:43.428 --> 28:45.539
Maya... I'll cover you. The
fire could easily come back.

28:45.563 --> 28:46.797
You go. I got this.

28:46.831 --> 28:49.633
Deborah, I'm coming in!

28:58.242 --> 29:00.888
Okay, I need you to stick close
and do as I say, you got it?

29:00.889 --> 29:03.257
Okay, okay, it's gonna be
a little slow going, though.

29:18.353 --> 29:19.697
- All right. We're gonna go.
- Thank you.

29:19.721 --> 29:23.447
- And up and at 'em!
- Aah! Aah!!

29:23.448 --> 29:25.916
Bishop, we're coming your way!

29:44.469 --> 29:45.860
Gas is off.

29:52.889 --> 29:54.757
No. She inhaled some glass!

29:54.791 --> 29:56.325
Go, go, go, go!

29:56.360 --> 29:57.927
Guys, get ready! We're coming out hot!

29:57.961 --> 30:01.330
We need a med kit right now!

30:01.365 --> 30:03.633
- Deborah!
- Pull her up. One, two, three.

30:05.002 --> 30:06.168
Deborah!

30:07.137 --> 30:09.705
She needs an airway. Intubating now.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.923
God! She has to be okay.

30:11.924 --> 30:13.258
Tell me she's gonna be okay.

30:13.292 --> 30:14.926
She's losing a lot of blood on the leg.

30:17.463 --> 30:18.573
There was glass flying everywhere.

30:18.597 --> 30:19.764
We think she inhaled a piece.

30:19.798 --> 30:21.343
Maya, how long's she been down?
You got to get in there.

30:21.367 --> 30:22.751
I know. There's an obstruction.

30:22.785 --> 30:24.711
You think it's stuck?

30:28.374 --> 30:31.135
Deb, say something!

30:31.136 --> 30:34.372
Yell at me! Tell I'm the worst sister!

30:34.406 --> 30:36.007
I am! I'm the worst!

30:36.041 --> 30:38.757
She's turning blue.
I need to bypass the blockage.

30:38.791 --> 30:40.078
Get a crike kit!

30:42.155 --> 30:44.423
We have to step back, okay?

30:44.457 --> 30:45.991
Give them some space. Come on.

30:46.025 --> 30:47.159
- Okay.
- Show me where.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.760
- Right there. Right there.
- Got it.

30:48.795 --> 30:49.761
Okay.

30:49.796 --> 30:50.896
Nice and steady.

30:52.765 --> 30:54.232
Please don't die!

30:56.182 --> 30:57.260
Okay.

30:58.538 --> 31:00.572
Still no pulse. I'm starting CPR.

31:02.875 --> 31:06.052
It has to work. It has to work.

31:07.187 --> 31:09.188
Get ready for transport.

31:10.324 --> 31:11.524
Deborah! Please!

31:11.558 --> 31:13.326
She has to be okay. Please tell me.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.461
She has to be okay!

31:15.496 --> 31:18.297
No. No.

31:18.332 --> 31:21.100
Don't give up, Deb!

31:27.641 --> 31:29.792
Okay, we've got a chest rise!

31:29.826 --> 31:31.277
She's breathing!

31:36.566 --> 31:38.351
- She's good.
- Okay.

31:46.093 --> 31:49.307
You almost left me.
You almost left me alone.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.306
You're my sister. I need you.

32:00.809 --> 32:04.044
Maya, that was... incredible.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.244
Is it because of the coaching thing?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.511
Are you upset about that?

32:27.546 --> 32:28.936
Nope.

32:28.937 --> 32:30.872
You can't help people who don't want it.

32:30.906 --> 32:32.250
And even though I always try,
I should know better.

32:32.274 --> 32:33.975
It was an offhanded comment.

32:34.009 --> 32:35.309
I was tired and frustrated.

32:35.344 --> 32:38.530
I wasn't trying to...
pull rank or anything.

32:38.531 --> 32:40.009
But you've been out of sorts all day.

32:40.033 --> 32:41.633
And you've been out of pocket.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.269
Is it something I did or I-I said or...?

32:44.303 --> 32:46.138
You know, not everything is about you.

32:46.172 --> 32:49.216
Then tell me. Talk to me.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.352
What's going on?

32:51.386 --> 32:53.754
My dad spent
all of his time and his money

32:53.788 --> 32:56.123
on me and my training.

32:58.034 --> 32:59.668
The winning and the medals,

32:59.702 --> 33:04.039
they were like... a drug.

33:04.073 --> 33:06.551
And Mason, he just...

33:08.351 --> 33:10.652
He got left behind.

33:10.686 --> 33:12.888
And he tried.

33:12.922 --> 33:16.645
He stopped running,
started trying other things.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.856
He got into art school,

33:20.885 --> 33:22.987
but my parents wouldn't pay for it.

33:23.021 --> 33:25.237
He wasn't the prospect.

33:26.949 --> 33:29.284
And I could see he was in pain,

33:29.318 --> 33:31.820
but we grew up embracing the pain.

33:31.854 --> 33:35.539
I guess I thought it would
make him stronger like me.

33:37.666 --> 33:42.697
I won an Olympic gold medal,

33:42.731 --> 33:45.383
and the day I won

33:45.417 --> 33:48.636
was the first time that Mason OD'd.

33:50.710 --> 33:53.682
And no one even knew about it because...

33:55.382 --> 33:58.517
he was home alone, and I was
abroad with my parents.

34:08.289 --> 34:10.623
I feel like it's all my fault.

34:13.221 --> 34:18.125
He's... my fault.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.791
I can keep an eye on him.

34:20.815 --> 34:23.628
When I'm on patrol. If you'd like.

34:33.768 --> 34:38.105
I was captain for a lot of years.

34:38.130 --> 34:42.032
And I'm... I'm not used to this,

34:42.056 --> 34:44.525
being part of the group,
part of the conversation.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.185
I-I've gotten used to being
outside the conversation,

34:47.210 --> 34:49.043
looking in at a distance.

34:50.866 --> 34:53.301
Sir, you don't have
to explain yourself to me.

34:53.326 --> 34:55.393
You have to have that distance to lead.

34:55.418 --> 34:58.655
But I don't want to be someone
people don't come to.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.648
I don't want to shut people out.

35:00.673 --> 35:03.742
And leading, it's not what I do anymore.

35:03.767 --> 35:06.869
It's... So my advice is

35:06.894 --> 35:10.842
if you like the nice,
young woman, just go to her.

35:13.170 --> 35:14.470
Bring her a new incident report

35:14.495 --> 35:16.730
since the old one was damaged.

35:16.755 --> 35:18.089
See how that goes.

35:18.114 --> 35:20.382
Sir, her incident report wasn't damaged.

35:21.764 --> 35:22.864
I...

35:24.476 --> 35:25.843
think it was.

35:29.132 --> 35:30.466
Ha.

35:32.902 --> 35:34.841
All right.

35:41.458 --> 35:45.695
You know, um, when someone experiences

35:45.720 --> 35:48.122
something like, you know, Blue Fire,

35:48.147 --> 35:51.316
I'm sure it's not unusual
for it to rattle you.

35:51.341 --> 35:53.342
Excuse me?

35:53.367 --> 35:55.835
I'm just saying, you know,
the way the VR got to you,

35:55.860 --> 35:57.928
yyour reaction at the fire today...

35:57.946 --> 35:59.577
I'm sure you can work through it, but
if I can help in any way, I would...

35:59.601 --> 36:00.928
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:00.952 --> 36:03.407
I do not have some fear of fire.

36:03.441 --> 36:04.819
Don't be ridiculous.

36:06.034 --> 36:08.402
You know, that is...
that is not the kind of thing

36:08.427 --> 36:09.794
a person works through.

36:09.819 --> 36:10.752
That's the kind of problem

36:10.777 --> 36:12.821
that turns a firefighter
into a postal worker.

36:12.846 --> 36:14.612
So let's be clear.

36:14.637 --> 36:16.405
It is not a problem I have.

36:17.659 --> 36:18.910
Okay.

36:19.374 --> 36:23.068
You know, I was... I was the
rookie like five minutes ago.

36:23.208 --> 36:24.676
I'm still building my reputation,

36:24.710 --> 36:26.262
and there is no coming back
from something like that,

36:26.286 --> 36:27.453
not in the eyes of the team.

36:27.478 --> 36:28.591
- I didn't mean...
- And unlike you,

36:28.615 --> 36:31.105
I do not have a medical degree
to fall back on.

36:31.670 --> 36:33.438
So I do not have a problem.

36:35.613 --> 36:36.780
Understood?

36:43.615 --> 36:45.249
Hey. I was just down the hall.

36:45.274 --> 36:48.206
Gary Shilabi fell
off the piano bench again.

36:48.447 --> 36:50.548
And I wanted to check in
on your shoulder.

36:50.573 --> 36:53.908
Yeah. I know why you're really here.

36:53.933 --> 36:56.534
And the answer is still no.

36:56.559 --> 36:58.836
Edith, I understand your hesitation,

36:58.861 --> 37:00.361
and I know that you think

37:00.386 --> 37:01.754
that you need to spare your grandson.

37:01.778 --> 37:03.612
Spare me from what?

37:10.022 --> 37:11.389
They were all out of strawberry,

37:11.424 --> 37:15.026
so... I brought orange and green flavors.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.666
Well, Montgomery, pick up
your jaw and say hello.

37:21.701 --> 37:23.929
He's a looker, isn't he?

37:25.456 --> 37:27.323
Love when she talks about me
like I'm not here.

37:27.358 --> 37:28.825
Hi. I'm Grant.

37:28.859 --> 37:30.326
- Travis.
- Hi.

37:30.361 --> 37:32.495
- Hi. Hey.
- Hello.

37:32.530 --> 37:36.399
So, what was she neglecting to tell me?

37:37.401 --> 37:41.271
I, It's...

37:41.305 --> 37:43.173
It's not really my place.

37:43.207 --> 37:45.375
Gran, what's going on?

37:47.740 --> 37:48.740
Well, go on, Montgomery.

37:48.774 --> 37:50.208
You say it better than I do.

37:50.242 --> 37:52.877
Now you're making me nervous.

37:52.912 --> 37:56.915
<i>All it takes is a single
spark to restart a fire.</i>

37:58.617 --> 38:03.721
Your grandmother needs
to see a physician very soon.

38:04.265 --> 38:07.352
I've noticed over the past few months...

38:08.501 --> 38:10.368
she's exhibited some symptoms.

38:10.393 --> 38:12.727
<i>Sadly, reignition usually starts</i>

38:12.752 --> 38:15.520
<i>at the most inconvenient moments.</i>

38:15.545 --> 38:18.066
<i>It catches. It takes hold.</i>

38:18.091 --> 38:20.006
Your sister came to see you,
and I think you should

38:20.030 --> 38:21.510
take a couple minutes to talk to her.

38:27.303 --> 38:29.038
<i>And if we aren't careful,</i>

38:29.063 --> 38:30.997
<i>it'll burn everything in its path.</i>

38:35.225 --> 38:37.727
<i>Because the fire has been here before.</i>

38:40.545 --> 38:44.214
God, after that call and, this day

38:44.239 --> 38:48.509
and Maya being weird, this...

38:48.534 --> 38:50.607
- Thank God we found this again.
- Andy.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.485
The fire knows what it's doing.

38:52.510 --> 38:53.510
No.

38:53.535 --> 38:55.102
You... You say my name like that,

38:55.127 --> 38:57.461
and I feel aa pin in your hand
about to pop the bubble.

38:57.486 --> 38:58.619
Don't... Don't pop it.

38:58.644 --> 39:00.239
I don't think this is enough for me.

39:00.264 --> 39:03.099
<i>The fire knows its way,
where to go, how to move.</i>

39:03.124 --> 39:06.089
Stop. Let's just stop with the talking.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.243
This is bubble time.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.211
And it's incredible, but...

39:08.245 --> 39:09.779
No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:09.813 --> 39:12.015
But it's delaying the inevitable.

39:12.049 --> 39:14.351
Thought that was the point.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.764
I've been going along with this.

39:15.765 --> 39:17.599
It's been fun.

39:17.633 --> 39:19.734
It definitely beats fighting.

39:19.769 --> 39:20.902
And it makes you happy.

39:20.937 --> 39:22.748
<i>It's already taking
the path of least resistance.</i>

39:22.772 --> 39:25.255
But it doesn't make <i>me</i> happy.

39:25.256 --> 39:28.458
And I-I can stand here
and pretend it's something else,

39:28.493 --> 39:30.627
but I-I had a ring,

39:30.661 --> 39:31.928
and I wanted more.

39:31.963 --> 39:33.430
And I still do.

39:33.464 --> 39:34.608
Why are we talking about that?

39:34.632 --> 39:36.266
'Cause we haven't.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.168
- Yeah, I know.
- So let's talk.

39:38.202 --> 39:39.503
- I don't want to.
- Why?

39:39.538 --> 39:41.438
Because I don't want more, Jack.

39:41.472 --> 39:43.640
I don't.

39:43.674 --> 39:45.960
Not... Not yet.

39:45.961 --> 39:48.663
Not with you. Not with anyone.

39:48.697 --> 39:50.097
I mean, maybe ever.

39:50.132 --> 39:51.632
I mean, you think about the home

39:51.667 --> 39:52.877
you'll build with someone someday.

39:52.901 --> 39:54.035
You imagine it.

39:55.838 --> 39:58.902
I-I have my home.

39:58.903 --> 39:59.970
I found it already.

40:00.004 --> 40:01.938
Here. With these people.

40:01.973 --> 40:05.509
At this station. I don't
want something separate.

40:05.543 --> 40:06.843
This is the home I know.

40:06.878 --> 40:08.812
I'm... I'm here.
I'm not looking for more.

40:08.846 --> 40:12.015
We were so good this morning.
What... What changed?

40:12.049 --> 40:13.717
Those sisters.

40:13.751 --> 40:15.462
Seeing how one couldn't live
without the other.

40:15.486 --> 40:18.054
All I could think was,
"I feel that for Andy."

40:18.089 --> 40:19.290
But she doesn't feel that way for me.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.401
What, you think I don't care about you?

40:20.425 --> 40:23.127
- No, I did not say that.
- Of... Of course I care, Jack.

40:23.161 --> 40:25.029
God, you... know I do.

40:25.063 --> 40:30.468
I j... But I just... I can't waste
time not being true to myself.

40:30.502 --> 40:31.879
Yeah, well,
I can't waste time in a bubble.

40:31.903 --> 40:34.206
But that's who we are.

40:34.207 --> 40:35.808
We met in a bubble.

40:35.842 --> 40:38.243
We fell for each other that way.

40:38.278 --> 40:41.180
We work great in a bubble.

40:41.214 --> 40:45.284
We are so good at taking off clothes

40:45.318 --> 40:47.119
and having fun

40:47.153 --> 40:50.088
and grabbing those moments
whenever we can.

40:50.123 --> 40:52.225
Can't we just be this?

40:52.958 --> 40:54.626
Us?

40:54.651 --> 40:57.252
In our incredible,
happy, sexy, naked bubble?

40:57.277 --> 40:59.578
Sorry, just needed
some more requisition forms.

41:01.762 --> 41:04.130
<i>The fire's hotter this time.</i>

41:05.113 --> 41:06.872
<i>Bigger. Stronger.</i>

41:06.906 --> 41:08.974
<i>More powerful.</i>

41:10.410 --> 41:13.212
<i>And so much more dangerous.</i>
