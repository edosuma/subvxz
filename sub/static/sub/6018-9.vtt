00:03.903 --> 00:06.167
What's supposed to be
so attractive about fur?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.705
Why does a man
wanna see a woman in fur?

00:08.875 --> 00:11.810
Men want women with shaved legs,
shaved armpits, plucked eyebrows.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.674
Then before we go out,
we dress them up like a bear?

00:15.281 --> 00:17.181
To me, the only reason to wear fur...

00:17.350 --> 00:20.285
...would be if you were trying
to sneak up on another animal.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.921
You ever see those tribal hunters
wearing the fur...

00:23.089 --> 00:26.820
...with the other animal's head
on top of their head, you know?

00:26.993 --> 00:30.156
I'm sure there's a moose looking at
that going, "Yeah. That looks good.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.391
Yeah. I'm gonna turn my back
on this goofball with the extra head...

00:34.567 --> 00:36.262
...because there's nothing
fishy there.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.336
I'll just keep drinking
from the stream.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.906
I've seen a lot of two-headed
tigers with knees."

00:45.545 --> 00:48.309
So I am actually gonna have
a secretary.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.711
-And I get to do the interview.
-It's incredible.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.749
You were taking messages
for your mother.

00:52.919 --> 00:55.410
And now someone's gonna be
taking messages for me.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.954
From your mother.

00:58.124 --> 01:00.388
So this woman you plan on hiring...

01:00.560 --> 01:02.994
...is she gonna be
in the spokesmodel category?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.831
Sure, I could go the tomato route...

01:05.999 --> 01:08.160
...but I've given this
a lot of thought, Jerry.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.996
All that frustration,
I'll never get any work done.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.071
So I'm doing a complete 360.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.605
I'm going for total
efficiency and ability.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.037
That's a 180, George.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.677
Whatever.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.837
-Hi, Willie.
-Hey, Jerry.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.242
I got this stuff...

01:22.415 --> 01:25.316
-...and my mother's fur for storage.
-What are you doing with it?

01:25.485 --> 01:28.181
She keeps it with me
for when she comes up from Florida.

01:28.354 --> 01:29.582
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.417
Jerry, you know my wife, Donna.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.491
Yeah. That's why I said "hi."

01:34.761 --> 01:36.786
Hey, nice jacket.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.328
Thanks. Houndstooth.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.255
This is a beauty.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.459
-Great cut. It's probably very flattering.
-Oh, yes.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.196
It really accentuates
my bust line.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.634
Well, I type about
90 words a minute.

01:48.808 --> 01:51.971
I'm completely well-versed in all
the lBM and Macintosh programs.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.376
Well, Miss Coggins, you're
obviously qualified for the job.

01:55.548 --> 01:58.676
You have all the necessary skills
and experience...

01:58.852 --> 02:01.480
...but you're extremely attractive.
You're gorgeous.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.487
I'm looking at you,
I can't even remember my name.

02:05.191 --> 02:08.786
So I'm afraid this is not
gonna work out. Thanks for coming.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.987
You're luscious.
You're ravishing.

02:11.164 --> 02:14.622
I would give up red meat just to get
a glimpse of you in a bra.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.065
I'm terribly sorry. Terribly sorry.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.361
As you can see, my references
are impeccable.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.336
I think I'd be a real asset here.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.635
My only concern is,
I do take care of my mother.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.835
So will there be many late nights?

02:26.412 --> 02:27.709
I can't imagine.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.582
Okay. So Barneys is having
this huge sale.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.218
I try this dress on.

02:33.386 --> 02:35.286
Stunning. Stunning.

02:35.455 --> 02:38.549
I couldn't take my eyes off myself.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.216
-Yeah?
-Okay. So then I put it on at home...

02:41.394 --> 02:44.022
...it looks like I'm carrying twins.

02:44.364 --> 02:47.731
So you're saying, store, hotsy-totsy,
Home, hotsy-notsy.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.201
Yeah, exactly.
Anyway, I gotta go there and return it.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.032
I thought we were going
to the movies.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.266
All right. I'll try it on again.
You tell me what you think.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.610
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, George.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.268
Hey, Elaine.

03:00.446 --> 03:03.847
I am telling you, Jerry,
having a secretary is incredible.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.882
Don't know why I didn't
have one before.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.111
Because you didn't have a job?

03:09.689 --> 03:10.917
Perhaps.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.955
I walk in, everything is organized.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.354
Messages, appointments.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.054
I can't tell you how proud I am
of myself for going with Ada.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.698
A lesser man would've crumbled.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.358
They would've gone for the dish and
the sure-fire sexual harassment suit.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.966
-It's a little--
-All right.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.441
You answered it right there.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.136
You got no waist in that thing.

03:34.314 --> 03:37.909
And your arms look like something
hanging in a kosher deli.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.480
I said, all right.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.747
-Well, why'd you buy it for?
-Why did I buy it?

03:43.923 --> 03:46.790
Because in the mirror at Barneys,
I looked fabulous.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.723
This woman who was just
walking by...

03:48.895 --> 03:51.625
...said I looked like Demi Moore
in <i>Indecent Proposal</i>.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.629
How fast was she walking?

03:55.468 --> 03:56.696
"Demi"?

03:56.869 --> 03:58.564
I thought it was "Demi."

03:58.972 --> 04:00.462
No, I think it's "Demi."

04:00.640 --> 04:02.164
Really?

04:02.342 --> 04:05.368
I never heard of
a "semi" tractor-trailer.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.175
Wait a minute.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.476
Wait a minute.
I know what's going on here.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.142
-Skinny mirrors.
-What?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.652
Skinny mirrors.
Barneys has skinny mirrors.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.757
They make you look,
like, 10 pounds lighter.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.449
Oh, you're crazy.

04:20.627 --> 04:21.855
Am l?

04:22.028 --> 04:24.428
Do you think I would've
bought this dress...

04:24.597 --> 04:26.827
...if I looked like this at Barneys?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.195
You know, I think
she may have something.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.472
What are you all dressed up for?

04:34.641 --> 04:36.666
I'm returning this dress to Barneys.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.367
Good idea.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.940
Do it tomorrow.
We'll go to the movies.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.706
-Yeah. Okay.
-Hey, if you're going...

04:42.882 --> 04:45.476
...maybe you can pick me up
some of this super-hydrating--

04:45.652 --> 04:49.179
It's a total-protection moisturizer
with UVA. Yeah.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.917
-Moisturizer? That's girl stuff.
-No. Look, I'll tell you what.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.684
-They're having a sale, right?
-Yeah.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.795
I'll meet you down there.
We'll have lunch.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.957
-Well, we could--
-Yeah, we'll get to know each other.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.226
We never get to spend
any time together.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.769
Oh, sure. We have
our little group here, but....

05:08.107 --> 05:10.837
And then, assuming
the strike is resolved...

05:11.010 --> 05:13.638
...on April 14th,
we play the Angels.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.441
So let's clear a floor
at the Anaheim Hotel.

05:16.616 --> 05:19.551
Anaheim Hotel.
You may wanna reconsider.

05:19.719 --> 05:22.085
I believe they only have
room service until 10 p.m...

05:22.255 --> 05:23.654
...then it's only finger foods.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.050
Ada, you're a wonder.

05:27.593 --> 05:30.994
Okay. Now, I projected those figures
for you regarding the switch...

05:31.164 --> 05:32.893
...to canola oil for stadium popcorn.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.762
And surprisingly, it'll only cost
half a cent more per bag...

05:35.935 --> 05:37.334
...so it is definitely doable.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.729
Ada, I have to tell you, I have
never met anybody so efficient.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.069
Well, thank you. I'm flattered.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.205
You're just a marvel of organization.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.441
Well, I'm just doing my job.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.477
It's like I'm--
I'm thinking of something...

05:54.654 --> 05:56.588
...and you're one step ahead of me.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.986
What can I say? I'm....

05:59.158 --> 06:01.592
I'm good at what I do.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.923
Do you...?

06:05.631 --> 06:07.826
Do you know what I'm...

06:08.000 --> 06:11.800
...thinking about now?

06:12.071 --> 06:14.335
Yes. I think I do.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.731
Is it...

06:18.478 --> 06:20.139
...doable?

06:20.847 --> 06:22.474
It's definitely doable.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.115
Well, that was the worst.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.521
I can't believe they made
the wife the killer.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.184
-Give me a break.
-Hey.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.455
Give us a break.
We haven't seen it yet.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.724
-Thanks a lot, bigmouth.
-Yeah.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.458
-You got a pen?
-Yeah. I think I do.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.360
And I need something to write on.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.402
Well, all I got is
my dry-cleaning stub.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.800
I just met Uma Thurman.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.738
She's giving me her telephone
number. Uma, Jerry. Uma.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.470
-Uma Thurman? Really?
-How'd you manage that?

06:53.646 --> 06:55.910
Yeah. Well, l--
I don't have any time to talk now.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.274
He's got the kavorca.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.447
-Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry cleaner?
-Where?

07:03.623 --> 07:05.488
He just went in.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.120
You know, l--

07:07.293 --> 07:10.490
I think he was wearing
my houndstooth jacket.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.657
What would he be doing
wearing your jacket?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.768
It looked just like the jacket
I brought in to be dry-cleaned.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.528
He complimented me on it.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.569
-Are you sure?
-I got it.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.765
Uma, Uma, Uma.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.603
-You are amazing.
-Yeah.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.473
All right. Taxi's on me.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.646
No, no, no. A better way
to reach the bra...

07:34.821 --> 07:38.154
...would be to undo the jacket
then go around the back of the shirt.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.722
Ada, you're incredible.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.762
Here. I wanna show you something.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.869
Hand me that pillow.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.636
Here.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.340
What?

07:55.908 --> 07:58.706
Oh, my God.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.607
Mr. Costanza.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.372
Ada.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.181
-I'm giving you a raise!
-Yes!

08:08.955 --> 08:11.719
So you're having sex,
then all of a sudden you just blurt out:

08:11.891 --> 08:14.724
"I'm giving you a raise"?

08:15.061 --> 08:16.426
Yeah.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.820
Just a quick sidebar here.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.023
Are you in any way
authorized to give raises?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.498
-Not that I'm aware of.
-No.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.568
So you're so grateful to have sex,
you'll shout out anything...

08:27.740 --> 08:29.332
...that comes into your head.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.238
I didn't think ahead.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.571
Well, maybe she'll just think
it was bawdy talk.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.581
I didn't say any other bawdy things.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.482
Maybe you could have sex
with her again and then take it back.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.581
All right. You're not
any help at all here.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.553
I don't know the point
of talking to you.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.920
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.894
Yeah. Well, the only thing I can do
is to go to George Steinbrenner...

08:52.064 --> 08:53.929
...and tell him he has
to give her a raise.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.261
-How long has she been there?
-Three days.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.999
-It's almost a week.
-Yeah.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.909
Oh, my God.

09:05.077 --> 09:08.410
-What?
-It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show.

09:08.581 --> 09:12.449
George, I think Willie the dry cleaner's
been wearing my clothes.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.250
These mirrors are skinny mirrors.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.121
This is false...

09:22.428 --> 09:24.555
...reflecting.

09:24.764 --> 09:28.825
And I think that the department of...

09:29.001 --> 09:30.696
...you know, whatever...

09:30.870 --> 09:34.772
...would be very interested
to know what's going on here.

09:35.107 --> 09:38.941
Well, we're more than happy
to exchange it for something else.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.942
Okay. Fine.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.206
I did like that little
Calvin Klein number...

09:43.382 --> 09:45.282
...right by the elevator,
with the little--

09:45.451 --> 09:48.818
-I'll bring it to your dressing room.
-Okay. Thanks so much.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.850
What are you all dressed up for?

09:52.024 --> 09:54.458
Well, Elaine, when you're
shopping on Madison Avenue...

09:54.627 --> 09:56.754
...you don't wanna skimp
on the swank.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.753
I like your little bag.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.593
Oh, yeah. Hey, look at this.

10:01.767 --> 10:06.704
This is a super-hydrating,
triple-action moisturizer, huh?

10:06.872 --> 10:08.863
Wait till that Uma smells this UVA.

10:11.577 --> 10:14.842
-Hey, Kramer.
-Hey, Bania. What's happening?

10:15.281 --> 10:18.614
I'm looking for a new suit,
but I can't find anything I like.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.920
-That's a nice suit.
-Well, thank you.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.749
-Did you get that here?
-No, no, no.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.221
This is vintage.
They don't make this stuff anymore.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.223
-You're telling me.
-I sure am.

10:28.527 --> 10:29.755
It's hard to find pants--

10:29.929 --> 10:31.988
-That don't make you high-waisted?
-Yes.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.825
-Me too.
-What size are you?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.932
-Forty-two.
-Forty-two? That's what I am now.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.071
I've been working out. I'm huge.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.039
How'd you like to sell it?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.066
Make me an offer.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.174
-One hundred bucks.
-Surely you jest.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.638
One seventy-five?

10:50.816 --> 10:52.283
Look at the stitching.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.352
This is old-world craftsmanship.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.111
-Three hundred dollars.
-Sold.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.190
-Follow me into the dressing room.
-You'll throw the shirt in?

11:00.359 --> 11:02.350
Bania, you're killing me.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.424
Hey, that's the women's
dressing room.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.588
There's nothing there
I haven't seen before.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.037
Mr. Steinbrenner?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.874
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:18.044 --> 11:19.841
Yes. Yes, George.
Can you talk to me?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.003
Of course you can.
I'm a very accessible man.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.945
I just wanna say you're doing great
on that canola-oil stuff.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.982
Well, you know,
to be honest, sir, my--

11:27.153 --> 11:29.383
My new secretary, Ada,
came up with that one.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.046
Ada. Ada. I like that name, George.

11:32.224 --> 11:33.885
She supports her whole family.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.687
-Is that a fact, George?
-Yes.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.624
In fact, her mother's in the hospital.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.924
It's some kind of a diverticulitis.

11:40.099 --> 11:43.626
I had a bout of that myself one time,
knocked me right on my ass.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.237
She can't even afford
to go out to lunch. She--

11:46.405 --> 11:48.339
She's been eating
in high school cafeterias.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.941
She pretends to be a teacher.
It's pathetic.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.805
What does that cost?
Two and a quarter?

11:52.978 --> 11:56.812
You know, I was just thinking
that she could really use a raise.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.450
She'd be better off making
a sandwich and bringing it.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.051
Hello?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.211
George, will you excuse me?

12:10.863 --> 12:12.660
Kramer. What are you doing?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.027
Listen, I need you
to get me some clothes.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.759
-What?
-Yeah. I just sold my suit...

12:16.936 --> 12:18.494
...to Bania for a cool 300.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.335
So go buy a new one.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.100
At this place?
It would destroy my profit margin.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.774
-So?
-Listen, do me a favor. Just call Jerry.

12:25.945 --> 12:28.140
Tell him to bring me some clothes.

12:35.988 --> 12:39.048
-Hello, Willie.
-Hey, Jerry.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.954
-You're dropping off.
-No...

12:41.127 --> 12:44.688
...but seen any good movies lately?

12:45.264 --> 12:47.528
-You came by to ask that?
-Yeah.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.429
Specifically, 9:30 shows.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.368
Seen any good 9:30 shows
at the Paragon, Willie?

12:53.539 --> 12:55.302
-What are you getting at?
-I saw you...

12:55.474 --> 12:57.772
...stepping out
with my houndstooth jacket.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.379
Jerry, that's a breach
of the dry cleaners' code.

13:01.547 --> 13:05.039
You need a code to tell you
not to wear people's clothes?

13:05.217 --> 13:07.708
I wasn't wearing your jacket.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.379
-Jerry, you're imagining things.
-Yeah.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.650
Am I imagining this?

13:15.161 --> 13:17.061
Found that little cutie in the pocket.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.787
-Jerry, l--
-Yeah. Well, now that...

13:18.964 --> 13:21.660
...we understand each other,
I'll take my business elsewhere.

13:21.834 --> 13:24.769
-I want my mother's fur coat back too.
-Jerry, come on.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.633
-Now.
-Now?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.414
Yeah. I want that coat.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.278
-Well--
-Where's the ticket?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.115
-Kramer.
-Wait a minute.

13:42.288 --> 13:45.587
You mean to tell me that
you don't have a ticket for the coat?

13:45.758 --> 13:47.316
No. Not on me.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.924
Well, I need to see that ticket.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.824
Why? I've gotten cleaning without it.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.897
Yeah, but this is different.

13:54.066 --> 13:57.058
Those fur-storage warehouses
are huge.

13:57.236 --> 14:00.171
You can't get anything
without a number.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.267
All right. I'll be back.

14:06.545 --> 14:09.571
Yeah. It looks good here,
but what does that mean?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.681
So do you want it?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.082
I don't know. I have to think about it.

14:16.388 --> 14:19.448
I need a nonpartisan mirror.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:29.735 --> 14:31.635
I can't thank you enough,
Mr. Costanza.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.898
-I'm so grateful.
-Yes. Well...

14:35.074 --> 14:37.008
...I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.007
I told him you have
been doing great work.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.874
I said that you deserved a raise,
and if you didn't get it...

14:42.047 --> 14:44.641
...that I was leaving.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.574
It was just so generous.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.050
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's got plenty of money.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.816
Oh, I know, but 25,000.

14:56.161 --> 15:00.530
-So you got a $25,000-a-year raise?
-Yes.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.893
-Oh, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner--
-You're making more than I am.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.799
-I am?
-A secretary cannot make more...

15:06.972 --> 15:10.669
-...than her boss.
-Well, apparently they can.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.751
Oh, this is insanity.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.223
I'm not this hip-y.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.852
Hey. Hey, what do you think of this?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.996
You'll never pull it off.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.292
Hey. What's going on in there?

15:36.468 --> 15:40.029
Excuse me. Could you tell me where l
could find women's moisturizer lotions?

15:40.639 --> 15:44.166
This woman's been in there
for over an hour.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.608
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything okay in there?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.113
Yeah.

15:55.087 --> 15:58.545
-Kramer?
-Jerry. You got my clothes?

15:59.091 --> 16:01.787
-What clothes?
-Didn't Elaine call you?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.360
No.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.256
Well, what are you doing here?

16:05.431 --> 16:08.764
What am I doing here?
You're in the women's dressing room.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.903
I need that ticket stub back so I can
get my mother's fur coat out.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.040
The stub. Yeah.
I left it in my-- My pants.

16:15.207 --> 16:19.109
-Where are your pants?
-Well, I sold them to Bania.

16:19.912 --> 16:23.143
What? You sold your pants
to Bania? Let me in.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.510
Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?

16:27.686 --> 16:29.916
I had Uma Thurman's number
written on that stub.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.351
I lost Uma's number.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.583
-Where are your clothes?
-I told you, I sold them to Bania.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.220
-You mean, what you were wearing?
-Yeah.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.024
How'd you expect
to get out of here?

16:40.332 --> 16:42.698
Well, I didn't think ahead.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.401
This-- This isn't gonna work for me.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.944
So if you could show me
something else.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.609
No.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.283
-No?
-No. Because you're taking that one.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.615
-I am?
-Yes. You wore it outside.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.224
That's preposterous.

17:08.394 --> 17:13.262
Well, I suppose that salt stain
came from all the snow in the store.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.760
Shall I wrap it,
or will you wear it out?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.800
No. You can wrap it.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.804
-Kramer, you still in there?
-Elaine?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.006
Jerry?

17:30.182 --> 17:31.979
-Elaine, where's Kramer?
-Bania?

17:32.151 --> 17:34.085
-Kramer?
-I'm going out.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.343
-Jerry.
-Bania.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.683
Kramer, I want my money back
for this suit.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.984
Your nancy-boy cream leaked
all over the pockets.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.492
-Suit's ruined.
-You're not getting any money back.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.392
-Jerry, come back.
-Excuse me.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.960
-Uma's number's on that ticket.
-Never mind Uma.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.103
I need that ticket
to get my mother's coat.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.795
Why not just give him the money?

17:53.972 --> 17:58.909
I'm not giving him $300 now for a suit
with moisturizer cream all over it.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.370
-I got an idea.
-What?

18:01.547 --> 18:04.141
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.917
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:07.486 --> 18:09.283
How's everything going?

18:09.621 --> 18:10.952
-Pretty good.
-Yeah.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.648
See, the thing is,
I'm in an awkward position here...

18:13.826 --> 18:16.954
...because I don't wanna get
between you two guys...

18:17.129 --> 18:20.360
...but I need a dry-cleaning ticket
that's in the pocket of those pants.

18:20.532 --> 18:23.126
All you gotta do is tell Kramer
to give me my money back...

18:23.302 --> 18:25.702
-...and you'll get your ticket.
-Yeah.

18:25.871 --> 18:29.671
Yeah, all right.
Well, tell you what I will do, Bania.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.469
You give me the ticket...

18:32.644 --> 18:35.807
...and I will take you out
for a nice dinner.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.174
Can we go back to Mendy's?

18:39.351 --> 18:41.581
You wanna go to Mendy's,
I'll take you to Mendy's.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.916
-Twice. I wanna go twice.
-All right, let's be reasonable, Bania.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.854
I'm taking you out for dinner.
All I want is a little ticket.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.824
-I think that's a pretty good deal.
-Two Mendy's.

18:52.564 --> 18:53.792
All right.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.332
-Just give me the ticket.
-Here you go.

18:57.236 --> 19:01.969
But, Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be
expected to perform my job properly...

19:02.141 --> 19:06.009
...knowing that my subordinate
is making more money than I am?

19:06.178 --> 19:08.578
With all due respect, sir,
it's out of whack.

19:08.747 --> 19:10.214
I understand what you're saying.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.282
I know what it's like
to be strapped.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.783
As a young man in Cleveland,
I hitchhiked to work.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.887
One time I got picked up
by a bakery truck.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.023
Think that smells good?
Try being cooped up...

19:19.191 --> 19:20.419
...in one of those babies.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.822
I couldn't look at a doughnut
for two years.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.758
Not that I was ever one
for the sweets.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.797
Sure, I like a cupcake every
now and then like everybody else.

19:27.966 --> 19:31.424
You know, I like it when they have
a little cream inside. It's a surprise.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.867
That's good.
Plus, the chocolate ones are good too.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.836
Sometimes I can't even
make up my mind.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.943
A lot of times, I'll mix the two together.
Make a vanilla-fudge.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.036
Let me in, it's me.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.204
Here. You don't know
what this is costing me.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.010
All right. Nice work.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.210
Wait. Where's Uma's number?

19:48.387 --> 19:51.584
The moisturizer smudged out
the phone number.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.719
The dry-cleaning number's
gone too.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.054
It must have been
the botanical extracts.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.026
Give me that.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.394
Hey, Bania, the dinner's off.

20:03.569 --> 20:06.231
The ticket's no good.
The numbers are all smudged out.

20:07.172 --> 20:08.764
You trying to get out of Mendy's?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.205
-You can't do that.
-The ticket is worthless.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.900
You promised me.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.413
Hey, isn't that my mother's fur coat?

20:25.424 --> 20:26.948
-No, it's not.
-It is.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.252
-Give me that back.
-What are you talking about?

20:29.428 --> 20:33.262
-You out of your mind?
-Are you crazy, taking my coat?

20:38.237 --> 20:41.104
What, do you think the dry cleaners
is your personal closet?

20:41.273 --> 20:43.639
Hey, Donna, can you get
the salt stain out of this?

20:43.809 --> 20:46.107
Let me see. Piece of cake.

20:46.278 --> 20:49.577
Bring it in. What size is it?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.359
This soup is great.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.495
Yeah, it's very good.

21:05.664 --> 21:10.226
I told you Mendy's had the best
pea soup. The best, Jerry. The best.

21:10.502 --> 21:13.528
-Are you enjoying it?
-Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time.

21:13.705 --> 21:15.536
Wait till you try the swordfish.

21:15.707 --> 21:17.641
You know, Jerry, I was thinking...

21:17.809 --> 21:20.505
...for our next meal, do you think
we should come here...

21:20.679 --> 21:22.203
...or should we go someplace else?

21:22.381 --> 21:23.609
It has its pros and cons.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.478
On the one hand, here,
you're guaranteed a great meal.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.779
-On the other hand--
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.751
This would be good,
but it'd be the same.

21:30.922 --> 21:34.153
If we go someplace else, it would
be different, but maybe not as good.

21:34.326 --> 21:37.318
It's a gamble. I get it.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.394
Yeah.

21:39.564 --> 21:42.397
Let's hurry. I gotta go.
I'm meeting a woman for a drink.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.900
-Oh, and who might that be?
-Some woman named Uma.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.539
I got her number off that ticket
before it was smudged.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.072
Hope she's good-looking.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.083
If you are a waiter or a waitress
and you see me in a restaurant...

22:05.257 --> 22:08.283
...I'm telling you right now,
I don't wanna hear about the specials.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.987
I don't wanna know about the specials,
I'm sick of the specials, I hate them.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.998
My feeling is, if the specials were
