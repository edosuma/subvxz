00:05.336 --> 00:06.967
ARLEY: The thing about life is,
 lots of times,

00:06.967 --> 00:09.090
you don't miss something
 till it's gone,

00:09.090 --> 00:11.052
like my freedom at
 the slushy window.

00:13.474 --> 00:15.636
Dad took Georgie
 to a basketball tournament,

00:15.636 --> 00:17.898
so Mom's covering
 the store,

00:17.898 --> 00:20.481
which leaves her plenty of
 "hang with Harley" time.

00:20.481 --> 00:21.982
She decided slushy.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.822
Cute boy, your age,
incoming.

00:31.822 --> 00:34.155
- Mom, be cool.
- Always.

00:34.155 --> 00:37.288
So, uh, just wondering.
You single, big guy?

00:38.619 --> 00:40.921
Not for me.
For my daughter.

00:40.921 --> 00:42.463
Shoot.

00:43.464 --> 00:45.666
Young man!
Excuse me.
Sorry.

00:45.666 --> 00:48.549
Good for Mom.
Seven kids,

00:48.549 --> 00:50.431
and still has the energy
to chase another one.

00:50.431 --> 00:53.174
With Dad gone, Mom has
no one to talk to.

00:53.174 --> 00:54.845
She's all up
in my business.

00:54.845 --> 00:56.477

"Mom-carena"?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.482

Dad's only gone
a few days.

01:24.965 --> 01:27.668
Yes, but this is a peek
into our future.

01:27.668 --> 01:30.711
As we all get older,
Mom will have more free time,

01:30.711 --> 01:33.804
and Dad as her bestie
won't be enough.

01:33.804 --> 01:35.426
As sick as it sounds,

01:35.426 --> 01:38.719
she'll look to her kids
for friendship.

01:38.719 --> 01:40.521
But it makes her happy.

01:40.521 --> 01:43.684
Oh. So you want
her to be happy.

I never thought
about it before,

03:25.085 --> 03:27.087
but she really doesn't
have a lot of friends.

03:27.087 --> 03:29.710
I know. She used
to have tons.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.462
But it was hard to find
time for them

03:31.462 --> 03:32.923
once she had Rachel,
Georgie,

03:32.923 --> 03:35.336

Beast and Daphne.

03:35.336 --> 03:36.547

Marshport Mom Friender.

"Find local women with
similar interests

03:43.934 --> 03:45.726
Wow. Lucky for us,

03:45.726 --> 03:48.649
this town is lousy with
friendless moms.

03:48.649 --> 03:49.940
Which picture should
we put on there?

03:49.940 --> 03:51.482
They don't use pictures.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.694
You're matched based on
common interests.

03:53.694 --> 03:56.116
Let's fill this out.
Mom's age.

03:56.116 --> 03:57.528
What she says,
or what she is?

03:57.528 --> 03:59.490
I don't know
either one.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.741
Me either.
Next one.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.573
Middle name.

04:02.573 --> 04:03.744
That's easy.
Maria.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.417
Maria? It's Rose.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.329
Or Lily.

04:08.329 --> 04:10.791
Or Daisy. It's
definitely a flower.

04:10.791 --> 04:11.922
Geranium?

04:11.922 --> 04:14.795
Suzy Geranium Diaz?

04:14.795 --> 04:16.587
Really?

04:16.587 --> 04:18.509
Think I better do some recon.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.471
LEWIE: We're under siege!

04:22.763 --> 04:25.346
This is not a duel!

04:25.346 --> 04:27.728
Stop, stop! I was just
returning the sword

04:27.728 --> 04:29.600
I found in my yard.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.732
Oh.

04:31.732 --> 04:34.815
Apologies for
the misunderstanding,
Lady Peters of Next Door.

04:34.815 --> 04:38.739
But you did come
into my kingdom
wielding a weapon,

04:38.739 --> 04:41.572
and you are assuming
the classic fight stance
of a knight.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.823
I was just holding
the sword like this.

04:42.823 --> 04:46.617
We're under siege!

04:46.617 --> 04:48.669
No, no, no, no!

04:51.211 --> 04:54.505
Beast, stop.

04:54.505 --> 04:57.678
Bethany, I didn't know
you had a play date
with the boys.

04:57.678 --> 05:00.631
I was returning
this violent weapon

05:00.631 --> 05:02.633
that landed in my yard.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.975
Living next to your family
is like living in
the Dark Ages with

05:04.975 --> 05:07.808
swords and pestilence
and plagues.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.690
I'm not allowed
to play games like this.

05:09.690 --> 05:12.062
At my house, we don't even
play Hide-And-Seek.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.696
We do. We play
hide your face in a book
and seek knowledge.

05:15.696 --> 05:18.899
I promise the boys won't
throw any more stuff
into your yard.

05:18.899 --> 05:21.702
BEAST: My shoe!

05:23.404 --> 05:25.496
I'm pretty sure
a bird dropped that.

05:29.289 --> 05:31.752
Come on, butler,
don't make me late.

05:31.752 --> 05:34.164
Just because Mom's
forcing me to take you
to play rehearsal

05:34.164 --> 05:36.086
doesn't make me
your butler.

05:36.086 --> 05:40.170
You're also responsible for
my bags and transportation.

05:40.170 --> 05:43.844
That makes you Mom's slave
and my butler.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.427
( frustrated groan )
People are gonna see me
hauling around a kid,

05:46.427 --> 05:48.639
taking public
transportation.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.971
I'm a shopping tote
away from being ordinary.

05:50.971 --> 05:55.646
Hey, you're being seen with
the star of the Friendly
Farm Show.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.939
The cow. The cow
can trample and kill.

05:58.939 --> 06:00.651
Chicken can't do that.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.983
Diazes are always
the star.

06:02.983 --> 06:05.155
When I was your age,
I was Cinderella.

06:05.155 --> 06:08.368
The play was about
nutrition, but none
of the four food groups

06:08.368 --> 06:09.870
wears a crown.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.252
Great story.

06:12.252 --> 06:14.705
You wanna grab my bag,
though, Princess?

06:17.798 --> 06:20.801
Hey. I'm ready to head
to the marina

06:20.801 --> 06:21.712
as soon as I find
my keys.

06:21.712 --> 06:23.343
Daphne's onesie.

06:23.343 --> 06:25.135
Wow.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.927
I haven't done laundry
in a while.

06:26.927 --> 06:30.431
Listen, Mom, I'm doing
an essay at school

06:30.431 --> 06:32.272
about my hero,
and I chose you.

06:32.272 --> 06:33.934
So I have a few questions.

06:33.934 --> 06:35.516
Oh!

06:35.516 --> 06:37.778
This would feel like
a much bigger win

06:37.778 --> 06:40.020
if I wasn't kneeling in
a pile of dirty skivvies.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.282
Okay, question one.

06:42.282 --> 06:45.736
What is the furthest distance
you would want a friend
to live from you?

06:45.736 --> 06:47.287
Weird. Um, okay.

06:47.287 --> 06:49.490
Twenty miles.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.911
Question two.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.833
Do you have
a significant other,

06:52.833 --> 06:56.707
and would he/she be jealous
of this new relationship?

06:56.707 --> 06:58.459
How is this about me
as your hero?

06:58.459 --> 07:00.340
Let's move on
to question three.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.342
Put the following
15 activities

07:02.342 --> 07:03.804
in order of preference.

07:03.804 --> 07:05.846
Snorkeling,
volleyball,

07:05.846 --> 07:08.308
Sudoku, murder mystery
dinners,

07:08.308 --> 07:09.970
- sky diving--
- Start with finishing
this survey.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.762
Anything else
comes second.

07:16.977 --> 07:18.819
( sighs )

07:18.819 --> 07:20.941
Tag "bogus day.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.563
Bomb hair."

07:22.563 --> 07:23.774
DAPHNE: I need air.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.781
It smells like
tush in here.

07:30.781 --> 07:33.373
Water me, butler.

07:33.373 --> 07:35.375
No. Absolutely not.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.789
I can't do juice box.
I'm trying to stay
in character.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.420
I'm talking about this.

07:40.420 --> 07:41.962
Not happening.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.844
Daphne...

07:43.844 --> 07:45.295
you are a Diaz,

07:45.295 --> 07:47.387
and no Diaz
is playing the butt.

07:47.387 --> 07:49.219
Excuse me, but
in the theater,

07:49.219 --> 07:50.851
we call it the rump.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.599
Okay, I'm going
to tell Mom we found
her a new friend.

07:58.599 --> 08:00.230
When you see
the big reaction,

08:00.230 --> 08:01.982
that's when you come in.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.483
Got it.

08:07.027 --> 08:09.279
Hey, Mom, you know
how you have no friends?

08:09.279 --> 08:11.782
- What?!
- Starting again.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.824
You know how sometimes
at work,

08:13.824 --> 08:15.375
you're all up in my face?

08:15.375 --> 08:17.457
Wow, I really should
have rehearsed this.

08:17.457 --> 08:18.879
You need a friend,

08:18.879 --> 08:20.831
so Ethan and I
went to a website online,

08:20.831 --> 08:22.623
set up a profile,
and found you one.

08:22.623 --> 08:23.964
You did what?!

08:23.964 --> 08:29.259
♪ Mom and friend ♪

08:29.259 --> 08:32.182
♪ She didn't have anyone,
now she does ♪

08:34.804 --> 08:37.057
Was that because
of my singing?

08:37.057 --> 08:38.899
No, but it
should've been.

08:42.312 --> 08:44.945
You set me up with
someone online?

08:44.945 --> 08:46.737
Me, your mother.

08:48.198 --> 08:50.821
See, Harley, I told you
it sounds weird.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.573
It sounds weird.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.865
Solid back-up
there, partner.

08:54.865 --> 08:57.868
Don't be upset.

08:57.868 --> 09:00.000
It was just to find
a friend, Mom.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.832
We realize you don't
have a lot,

09:01.832 --> 09:03.964
- and we wanted to help.
- I have friends.

09:03.964 --> 09:06.006
Lucy comes over
almost every day.

09:06.006 --> 09:07.968
That's because
she's our mail carrier.

09:07.968 --> 09:10.130
It doesn't count if they're paid
by the government to visit.

09:10.130 --> 09:13.053
I guess I've been
so busy with you kids,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.766
I let my friends
slip away.

09:15.766 --> 09:18.849
Like my freedom
at the slushy window,

09:18.849 --> 09:21.311
Mom didn't miss her friends
until they were gone.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.684
But both of our problems
were about to be solved

09:23.684 --> 09:26.647
by forcing Mom to be friends
with someone she doesn't know.

09:26.647 --> 09:29.449
Ethan's right.
That does sound weird.

09:30.651 --> 09:32.653
But guess what.

09:32.653 --> 09:35.535
We found you a friend
online that matches you 95%.

09:35.535 --> 09:38.158
- 95%!
- That's almost
a perfect match.

09:38.158 --> 09:40.540
You found me
another me.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.292
And she's free to meet
this afternoon.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.084
Okay.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.335
I'll do it.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.167
I better go put on
some deodorant.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.259
That Mom-carena
really works up a sweat.

09:54.675 --> 09:57.017
Oh, no. Mom can't
meet a friend

09:57.017 --> 09:58.979
with Ms. Peters here.

10:00.931 --> 10:04.274
Hey, Ms. Peters.
A special deal right now.

10:04.274 --> 10:07.067
A free slushy to anyone who
leaves in the next 30 seconds.

10:07.067 --> 10:10.110
No, thank you.
I'm yang shen,

10:10.110 --> 10:11.942
and my Chinese herbalist
has advised I consume

10:11.942 --> 10:13.734
all foods at
room temperature.

10:13.734 --> 10:16.787
Well, I'm feng shui, and I think
you're better off outside.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.578
I can't leave, Harley.

10:18.578 --> 10:20.120
I'm here to meet someone.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.042
A new friend who
matches me 95%

10:22.042 --> 10:25.005
on Marshport Mom Friender.

10:25.005 --> 10:27.958
I don't know why they chose
to meet here.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.550
Must be part of the five percent
we don't match.

10:30.550 --> 10:33.924
- ( small chuckle )
- I couldn't find deodorant,
so I used toothpaste.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.926
Hopefully my new friend
won't think it's weird.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.139
She might.

10:41.221 --> 10:43.353
BOTH: What?!
No!

10:43.353 --> 10:45.936
Look. Same horrified
reaction.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.729
You are
a perfect match.

10:53.113 --> 10:55.946
I have a plan to get you
out of that cow suit
and into stardom.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.199
But I'm already a star.
The cow's rump.

10:59.199 --> 11:03.043
Milk, poop--
everything comes out
of my end.

11:03.043 --> 11:05.125
The only thing that
comes out of the front

11:05.125 --> 11:06.837
is "moo."

11:10.550 --> 11:12.753
Don't make Death-nee
cut you!

11:12.753 --> 11:14.344
Fine.

11:14.344 --> 11:16.056
I'll help you be
a better cow.

11:16.056 --> 11:18.178
If Lady Gaga can shine
in a meat suit,

11:18.178 --> 11:19.349
so can you.

11:22.763 --> 11:24.224
She says you have
two minutes.

11:24.224 --> 11:26.016
We're listening.

11:26.016 --> 11:30.520
Obviously the Marshport Mom
Friender algorithm's wrong.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.193
I mean, there's no way Bethany's
favorite coffee creamer is...

11:33.193 --> 11:35.115
BOTH: Hazelnut.

11:35.115 --> 11:37.277
Or your favorite actor is...

11:37.277 --> 11:39.579
BOTH: John Stamos.

11:39.579 --> 11:41.782
This has to be a fluke.

11:41.782 --> 11:44.624
BOTH: Teal, Bermuda,
coconut cream pie.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.747
Poodles, pugs, Chihuahuas.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.830
You actually have
a lot of the same tastes.

11:49.830 --> 11:53.173
Guess you never got
past the bickering
long enough to see it.

11:53.173 --> 11:54.384
I just can't believe this.

11:54.384 --> 11:57.007
Tony, watch the store.
We're going for a...

11:57.007 --> 11:58.759
BOTH: Long walk
on the beach.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.605
I don't know
what this is,

12:05.605 --> 12:07.437
but I'm afraid
I'll wake up,

12:07.437 --> 12:09.479
and it will be gone.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.482
Sh. Don't move.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.070
Bethany and I talked
almost all night,

12:20.070 --> 12:22.202
and we realized
once you get past

12:22.202 --> 12:23.623
our initial parenting bumps,

12:23.623 --> 12:25.125
we really aren't
so different.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.868
You might not be,
but this breakfast is.

12:27.868 --> 12:29.629
You used the oven?

12:29.629 --> 12:31.171
Is Abuela coming to visit?

12:31.171 --> 12:33.003
No. Bethany reminded me

12:33.003 --> 12:35.135
that breakfast is the most
important meal of the day,

12:35.135 --> 12:37.297
so getting up to cook
is worth it.

12:43.473 --> 12:46.056
Juice comes from that?!

12:46.056 --> 12:48.268
I always thought
it came from a carton.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.062
This is blowing
my mind.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.237
And we got
breakfast bandanas.

12:57.237 --> 12:59.699
Classy, but that's
a napkin.

13:01.451 --> 13:04.284
( gasps )
OMG!

13:04.284 --> 13:06.706
I'm seeing floor.
Lots of floor!

13:06.706 --> 13:08.788
Someone stole
our dirty clothes!

13:08.788 --> 13:11.671
No. Bethany and I
did laundry while we chatted.

13:11.671 --> 13:13.503
I'll be doing it
more regularly now.

13:13.503 --> 13:15.625
If you stay on top of it,
it won't pile up.

13:15.625 --> 13:18.879
How are we supposed
to find our clothes
without climbing Machu P-U?

13:18.879 --> 13:21.091
You'll look in
your drawers,

13:21.091 --> 13:23.013
which will no longer
just be things you pull
out to make forts.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.267
Clean clothes in drawers?

13:27.267 --> 13:30.060
It's like colonizing Mars.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.102
Something I've dreamed of,
but never thought I'd see

13:32.102 --> 13:34.855
- in my lifetime.
- Sorry, Ethan.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.897
Marshport Mom Friender
is my new BFF.

13:39.529 --> 13:42.863
Okay, step one to
being the star
is claiming the stage.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.495
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to draw focus.

13:45.495 --> 13:48.118
I can draw a unicorn
eating a cat.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.160
Mom and Dad really
punted with you.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.833
I can't believe this.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.546
Our moms are friends,
and it's great.

13:56.546 --> 13:58.718
It's so weird.

13:58.718 --> 14:01.551
I didn't have to fight
through roller skates
and shoes to come in.

14:01.551 --> 14:03.343
I got scared
and ran back out

14:03.343 --> 14:05.425
because I thought
I was in the wrong house.

14:05.425 --> 14:07.557
So clean, I can't
find the remote.

14:07.557 --> 14:10.230
It's usually under a magazine
or a plate of old food.

14:10.230 --> 14:11.641
Mom!

14:11.641 --> 14:14.024
I can't find the remote.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.937
The remote is here, but I'm
afraid you can't have it.

14:16.937 --> 14:18.478
What? Why?

14:18.478 --> 14:20.530
The breakfast Bethany suggested
was such a hit,

14:20.530 --> 14:23.113
I asked her for
a few more pointers.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.745
Media usage chart.

14:25.745 --> 14:28.288
Sorry. You've already used
your screen time for today.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.790
May I suggest
a language-learning tape,

14:30.790 --> 14:32.162
or meditation?

14:32.162 --> 14:34.544
What is this?

14:34.544 --> 14:36.416
My house.

14:44.214 --> 14:46.056
Why do we need a chart
to limit our screen time?

14:46.056 --> 14:47.637
That's what sleep is for.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.389
This is so helpful.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.181
It clearly says who gets
to watch when.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.353
No more fighting over
the remote.

14:53.353 --> 14:55.315
Why does Sunday
just say no?

14:55.315 --> 14:57.277
Sunday is fun day.

14:57.277 --> 14:59.319
Media free,

14:59.319 --> 15:01.321
but lots of time to
cultivate your family

15:01.321 --> 15:02.612
while you cultivate
your garden.

15:02.612 --> 15:05.285
And I brought you
a gift, Harley.

15:05.285 --> 15:08.828
Child-safe pruning
shears. Huh?

15:08.828 --> 15:11.451
Thanks, but I have
real shears in my invention bag.

15:11.451 --> 15:12.872
Not anymore.

15:12.872 --> 15:15.205
Your mom and I went through
that hazardous bag

15:15.205 --> 15:16.586
and removed everything sharp.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.798
It's full of tools
and broken toys.

15:18.798 --> 15:21.131
Everything in it is sharp.

15:21.131 --> 15:23.503
I'm sure you can invent
lots of cool stuff

15:23.503 --> 15:25.715
with washable crayons
and non-permanent glue.

15:28.098 --> 15:31.101
You know how parents
 say some friends
 are a bad influence?

15:31.101 --> 15:34.224
Well, I set my mom up with
 the worst influence of all.

15:36.396 --> 15:40.400
We're trading violence
for violins.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.192
These used to be Ellie's.

15:43.653 --> 15:45.775
This is a terrible sword.

15:45.775 --> 15:48.118
It would take forever
to saw off an arm.

15:51.071 --> 15:53.453
I think mine's broken.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.670
Who took my heels?

16:00.670 --> 16:02.542
Heels shorten
your calf muscles.

16:02.542 --> 16:06.296
They're bad for your arches,
and your reputation.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.757
That was Bethany's.

16:07.757 --> 16:09.349
She's way funnier
than I thought.

16:09.349 --> 16:11.931
The only joke
is these grandma shoes.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.853
They couldn't be worse.

16:13.853 --> 16:15.975
They're comfy.
I got myself a pair.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.770
- And now they're worse.
- Excuse me.

16:20.770 --> 16:22.362
My guitar amp
used to go to ten.

16:22.362 --> 16:24.154
Why does it only go
to two now?

16:30.820 --> 16:33.533
These don't look like
cheeseburgers.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.496
No. I said I was making
cheese bulgurs.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.289
Bulgur is a delicious
cracked wheat.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.833
The wheat's not the only
thing that's cracked.

16:51.341 --> 16:53.473
This doesn't look like
a cappuccino.

16:53.473 --> 16:55.475
Caffeine stunts your growth.

16:55.475 --> 16:57.347
I said kelp-accino.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.642
This is a disaster.

17:02.642 --> 17:05.855
Mom's best friend
is our worst nightmare.

17:09.358 --> 17:11.411
Dance? Cows don't dance.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.153
They do now.

17:13.153 --> 17:15.325
A lot of people think
that dancing is up here.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.037
Wrong. It's right here.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.250
Not bad.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.252
Get ready to own it.

17:22.252 --> 17:23.423
Watch me.

17:23.423 --> 17:24.964
Drop shoulder.

17:24.964 --> 17:28.218
Give look.
Lift shoulder.

17:28.218 --> 17:29.839
This is ridiculous.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.631
I just do not
have a bad side.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.173
Me either.

17:35.475 --> 17:39.389
( violins playing
discordantly )

17:39.389 --> 17:41.311
I hate to tell you, Harley,

17:41.311 --> 17:43.773
but your happy place helmet

17:43.773 --> 17:46.356
is not taking me
to a happy place.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.027
Don't blame the helmet.

17:48.027 --> 17:50.029
It was designed to
cancel out quieter sounds,

17:50.029 --> 17:51.691
like a jet engine,

17:51.691 --> 17:53.823
or the Earth imploding.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.117
The Earth never implodes
when you want it to.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.583
Be one with
the instrument.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.915
Eat, live, breathe it.

18:05.915 --> 18:08.087
Take it with you
everywhere you go.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.879
Great.

18:09.879 --> 18:12.302
This is going to be
the soundtrack of our life.

18:12.302 --> 18:14.844
I used to come
to this house to escape.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.347
Now there's no escape.

18:19.429 --> 18:22.772
No one comes between
the Diaz kids

18:22.772 --> 18:24.484
and our right to
disorganization,

18:24.484 --> 18:27.066
sharp tools,
and screen time.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.440
Time to prune
 Mom's friend garden.

18:33.533 --> 18:36.075
I was skeptical,
but gardening is satisfying.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.198
So satisfying.

18:38.198 --> 18:40.580
Hey, Ms. Peters
is awesome,

18:40.580 --> 18:42.041
but why limit yourself?

18:42.041 --> 18:44.083
I found you another
friend match.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.455
I don't know.

18:45.455 --> 18:46.956
Bethany is working out.

18:46.956 --> 18:49.299
Plus I really don't have
time for more friends.

18:49.299 --> 18:52.632
But should your only friend
be a person who called
animal control on your sons?

18:52.632 --> 18:56.386
To be fair, they were
hissing and pawing
through her trash bin.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.429
I never gave
Bethany a chance.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.601
Thank you, Harley, for
helping me discover a friend

19:01.601 --> 19:03.263
right next door.

19:03.263 --> 19:04.974
Don't thank me.

19:04.974 --> 19:06.976
Seriously.
Don't.

19:06.976 --> 19:08.608
- ( phone alarm rings )
- Oh!

19:08.608 --> 19:10.690
Time to get ready
for Daphne's show.

19:13.363 --> 19:15.405
Okay, we have hip-hop,
Euro-pop,

19:15.405 --> 19:16.576
dance pop and K-pop.

19:16.576 --> 19:18.658
Which one feels
more cow to you?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.541
Did I hear lollipop
in there?

19:21.541 --> 19:23.453
- That one.
- I'll pick.

19:23.453 --> 19:27.337
Get ready. The Friendly
Farm Show's about to get real.

19:31.501 --> 19:34.844
Mom, you should totally
invite Ms. Peters to the show.

19:34.844 --> 19:36.716
It's just a little
kindergarten play.

19:36.716 --> 19:38.388
She wouldn't be interested.

19:38.388 --> 19:40.059
You're interested,
which means

19:40.059 --> 19:42.602
there's a 95% chance
that she'll be interested too.

19:42.602 --> 19:44.143
You're right.

19:48.568 --> 19:50.480
Get ready.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.652
The Unfriend A Mom Friend Show
is about to get real.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.951
I'm glad to see you're
bonding with your instruments.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.955
Oh. I mostly just brought it
to carry snacks.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.498
It's like a big lunchbox.

20:11.331 --> 20:13.793
Gummi? Just don't take
the red ones.

20:13.793 --> 20:15.094
I like those.

20:15.094 --> 20:16.966
No, thank you.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.548
My family has respect
for their teeth.

20:18.548 --> 20:19.889
Isn't that right, Ellie?

20:19.889 --> 20:24.724
( piano playing
"Old MacDonald Had A Farm" )

20:24.724 --> 20:26.606
AUDIENCE: Aww!

20:31.351 --> 20:33.022
( needle scratches )

20:35.815 --> 20:39.028
E-i, e-i,
no, I didn't!

20:39.028 --> 20:40.860
( dance music starts )

20:44.744 --> 20:47.246
♪ Gonna rap this farm
and I ain't trippin' ♪

20:47.246 --> 20:49.669
♪ This here cow

21:01.681 --> 21:03.723
Where my party animals at?

21:03.723 --> 21:06.556
Friendly Farm,
make some noise!

21:06.556 --> 21:08.728
( kids screaming )

21:11.020 --> 21:12.772
Did you know
about this?

21:12.772 --> 21:13.773
Not at all.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.106
I did.
Well, maybe not this.

21:17.106 --> 21:19.609
This is way better
than I hoped.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.200
Turn down for what?!

21:21.200 --> 21:24.784
Killer cow out.
Moo.

21:25.955 --> 21:28.328
Your family
is out of control.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.750
I don't believe in spanking,
but I hope you do.

21:30.750 --> 21:31.961
You're right.
They should not be

21:31.961 --> 21:34.123
sword fighting
with violins,

21:34.123 --> 21:36.796
or booty shaking
in cow suits,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.217
or... ( laughs )

21:38.217 --> 21:39.679
I'm sorry. Just
hearing myself,

21:39.679 --> 21:42.422
I can't get through
that sentence.

21:42.422 --> 21:44.724
You think this is funny?

21:44.724 --> 21:46.135
Because I think
this is an outrage.

21:46.135 --> 21:48.638
Because you expect
things to be perfect

21:48.638 --> 21:51.310
all of the time,
but you know what, Bethany.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.394
Life isn't like that,
especially not in my family.

21:54.394 --> 21:57.196
I've got seven crazy kids
who do crazy things,

21:57.196 --> 22:00.440
and I can laugh
or I can cry.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.111
Laughing is a heck
of a lot more fun.

22:02.111 --> 22:05.244
I thought our 95% match
meant something.

22:05.244 --> 22:06.996
But you're the same old
loosey-goosey,

22:06.996 --> 22:09.749
anything-goes Suzy Diaz,
and you're not changing.

22:09.749 --> 22:12.412
Hey, you know what.
We agree on that, too.

22:12.412 --> 22:14.954
Maybe our five percent
difference is 100% why

22:14.954 --> 22:16.756
we'll never be friends.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.804
Sorry it didn't
work out.

22:24.804 --> 22:26.175
I really was hoping
you'd find a new friend.

22:26.175 --> 22:28.057
It's all good, Harls.

22:28.057 --> 22:31.471
You reminded me that
I need to reconnect with
my old ones.

22:31.471 --> 22:33.022
But until then,

22:33.022 --> 22:34.644
loosey-goosey,
anything-goes,

22:34.644 --> 22:36.436
my-family's
my-best-friend

22:36.436 --> 22:37.567
Suzy Diaz
works for me.

22:42.442 --> 22:44.444
Works for me, too.

22:48.698 --> 22:50.830
The thing about life is,

22:50.830 --> 22:52.832
lots of times,
 you don't miss something

22:52.832 --> 22:54.664
till it's gone.

22:54.664 --> 22:58.047
And sometimes gone
 is the best part.
