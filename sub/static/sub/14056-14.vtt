00:00.039 --> 00:01.445
Previously, on The O.C.--

00:01.523 --> 00:04.038
Do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?

00:04.148 --> 00:06.615
She seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.

00:06.698 --> 00:08.710
But they're just friends, so why would it matter?

00:08.795 --> 00:09.907
I love Ryan.

00:09.987 --> 00:11.517
It doesn't mean that you don't like Johnny.

00:11.605 --> 00:12.150
I don't.

00:12.245 --> 00:14.868
Then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.

00:15.679 --> 00:17.991
We both have very complex lives, and...

00:18.117 --> 00:21.688
maybe we should consider all of the implications before going further.

00:21.791 --> 00:22.819
Are we building a hospital?

00:22.906 --> 00:24.739
Is it too late for a new approach?

00:24.820 --> 00:25.902
Let's do it your way.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.949
You're trying to take care of me. The least I can do is take care of you.

00:29.051 --> 00:30.293
Caleb would've been proud.

00:30.402 --> 00:31.347
We got it.

00:31.507 --> 00:33.109
Sandy, that's wonderful.

00:33.445 --> 00:34.749
And you did it your way.

00:34.863 --> 00:35.610
Yeah.

00:35.816 --> 00:37.486
Cohen! I got one!

00:37.664 --> 00:38.869
Got an interview with the Brown guy.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.164
Mrs. Rothschild just told me, and that you got one, too.

00:41.235 --> 00:42.472
Please tell me it went okay.

00:42.552 --> 00:44.847
It went great. We totally bonded.

00:45.468 --> 00:46.381
Are you high?

00:46.792 --> 00:48.095
Am I high?

00:52.678 --> 00:53.425
Ryan.

00:54.218 --> 00:54.954
Ryan.

00:55.278 --> 00:56.215
Come on, wake up.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.446
Hey. What's wrong?

00:58.545 --> 00:59.620
Seth is gone.

01:00.613 --> 01:01.720
What? He's gone?

01:01.811 --> 01:05.306
Yeah. His alarm went off, I went into his room, his bed his empty.

01:06.034 --> 01:08.027
Uh... calc exam.

01:08.119 --> 01:08.996
Calc exam?

01:09.090 --> 01:13.069
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, he probably just went in early to school to cram for it.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.584
Yeah, well, I'm gonna drive over there to make sure.

01:14.672 --> 01:16.710
No, no. I'll go. I'll go.

01:16.818 --> 01:18.340
I got to get to school early anyway.

01:18.455 --> 01:21.221
If there was anything going on with, Seth, anything I should know,

01:22.514 --> 01:24.067
you would tell me, right?

01:25.064 --> 01:25.895
Yeah.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.824
I'll call you, uh, when I find him.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:50.348 --> 01:51.119
Hey, man.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.316
So, uh, Sandy noticed you're gone-- he's worried.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.637
Just taking in the sunrise, Ryan.

01:57.741 --> 01:59.368
Yeah, that's what they have windows for.

02:00.068 --> 02:03.843
So I wanted to be alone-- are you the only one in this family that's allowed to brood?

02:03.972 --> 02:05.843
Man, whatever it is, you can tell me.

02:08.592 --> 02:11.522
My Brown interview did not go... so well.

02:11.616 --> 02:13.370
Actually, it didn't go at all.

02:13.895 --> 02:14.822
You blew it off?

02:15.135 --> 02:15.891
Yep.

02:16.190 --> 02:19.817
And then to put the cherry on top of that, I went ahead and lied to Summer about it.

02:21.727 --> 02:22.510
Right.

02:23.965 --> 02:26.440
Well... I don't know, talk to her.

02:26.531 --> 02:29.189
Yeah, see, Summer was over pot by the tenth grade.

02:29.405 --> 02:32.861
She thinks it's totally juvenile-- it'd be like telling her I'm into Beanie Babies.

02:32.957 --> 02:35.051
Well, you know, at least tell her that you missed the interview.

02:35.128 --> 02:37.527
You do that, and I'll keep quiet about the rest of it.

02:37.628 --> 02:40.148
We're getting dangerously close to an after-school special here, Ryan.

02:40.233 --> 02:41.928
It's marijuana, and I did it twice.

02:42.014 --> 02:44.210
So you're telling me you didn't come down here to buy a bag?

02:49.681 --> 02:51.777
Fine, I wasn't gonna smoke anymore anyways.

03:26.916 --> 03:27.975
What are you doing?

03:28.268 --> 03:30.515
Trying to decide on a bathing suit.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.136
Do you think tankinis are over?

03:33.256 --> 03:34.427
You're going swimming?

03:35.107 --> 03:35.867
No.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.750
Johnny's taking me for a surf lesson.

03:39.521 --> 03:41.547
He says the waves are always best in the morning.

03:42.214 --> 03:43.483
That's what I hear.

03:45.453 --> 03:48.491
Look... I know that you're mad about me and Johnny.

03:48.577 --> 03:50.603
I'm not mad. Do I look mad?

03:51.027 --> 03:54.378
Okay, we may not be BFFs, but you're my sister,

03:54.463 --> 03:55.940
and I can tell when you're mad.

03:56.238 --> 03:58.397
Kaitlin, look in my eyes.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.056
I don't care about you and Johnny.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.811
You have a boyfriend.

04:03.919 --> 04:05.592
So Johnny Harbor's fair game, right?

04:05.670 --> 04:06.845
I'm not talking about this.

04:06.937 --> 04:10.207
Can you honestly tell me you have no feelings for him?

04:13.595 --> 04:14.778
That's what I thought.

04:15.587 --> 04:16.599
Hey.

04:17.075 --> 04:18.199
You're right on time.

04:18.536 --> 04:21.185
Sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on anything.

04:22.206 --> 04:23.358
No problem.

04:23.623 --> 04:24.590
You ready to surf?

04:24.725 --> 04:27.006
Uh, I got to go. Enjoy the beach.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.728
Katy Rubell, 39, single.

04:34.822 --> 04:37.657
Loves  tennis, loves working out. Do we have anyone for her?

04:37.926 --> 04:39.599
I say she dies alone.

04:39.704 --> 04:40.641
Julie!

04:40.774 --> 04:44.194
I'm sorry, I just can't focus on fixing other people's love lives

04:44.282 --> 04:45.654
when my own is such a mess.

04:45.761 --> 04:47.182
Dr. Roberts will call you.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.607
Or if you want, you could call him.

04:51.569 --> 04:53.761
I know you've been married for, like, 200 years,

04:53.853 --> 04:56.355
but you must remember something about dating.

04:56.459 --> 04:58.755
Well, I hope so, or I'm in the wrong business.

05:02.095 --> 05:03.750
Maybe that's the answer.

05:04.066 --> 05:06.747
Pitch Dr. Roberts the dating service, set him up.

05:06.827 --> 05:08.115
Set him up? Are you high?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.297
No, I'm serious.

05:09.406 --> 05:12.470
Then you'll be back on his radar and it won't seem like you're pursuing him.

05:13.321 --> 05:16.674
I like it. I'm aloof but thoughtful.

05:16.768 --> 05:18.865
And when he's confronted with the idea of dating these Newpsies...

05:18.954 --> 05:20.476
Half of whom he's Botox'd himself.

05:20.567 --> 05:23.559
...he will realize that the only woman he wants is you.

05:23.646 --> 05:24.979
And he will call you for dinner.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.743
I'll suggest Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.

05:29.022 --> 05:30.108
I'm impressed.

05:30.256 --> 05:32.187
You're sneakier than I thought, Kirsten Cohen.

05:32.285 --> 05:35.477
Well, being around you all these years, it's rubbed off.

05:42.997 --> 05:43.662
Hey.

05:44.370 --> 05:45.382
Hey, Cohen.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.585
Hey, did you write your thank you note yet to the Brown interviewer?

05:49.330 --> 05:52.536
No. Actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.

05:52.628 --> 05:56.009
Oh,  you came to the right person, because I am master of the thank you note.

05:56.211 --> 05:57.424
Listen to this.

05:57.561 --> 06:00.212
"Thank you so much for the resplendent interview."

06:00.311 --> 06:01.184
"Resplendent."

06:01.281 --> 06:02.018
Yeah.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.362
I bought a thesaurus.

06:03.469 --> 06:05.409
Shelly loves SAT words.

06:05.763 --> 06:08.152
Hey, I didn't know you two were on a first-name basis.

06:08.247 --> 06:09.869
Oh, yeah, we totally power-bonded.

06:09.961 --> 06:12.625
Which means I may actually have a chance of getting into Brown.

06:12.739 --> 06:13.719
Do you know what that means?

06:13.819 --> 06:17.135
No calling, no texting, no e-mailing-- just us together, isn't that great?

06:17.244 --> 06:18.145
Y eah.

06:18.332 --> 06:21.401
Okay, so tell me-- how did your interview really go? Do you think you aced it?

06:24.602 --> 06:26.480
I knocked it out of the park.

06:26.588 --> 06:28.206
- Really?!
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:28.315 --> 06:33.583
And it wasn't easy, believe me, but, you know, I turned on the Cohen charm, as usual, and...

06:34.437 --> 06:35.949
the lady swooned.

06:37.229 --> 06:38.565
- Cohen?
- Yeah?

06:38.841 --> 06:40.201
Shelly's a guy.

06:42.081 --> 06:46.230
Is it because... yes, yes, you're... I'm sor... correct.

06:46.321 --> 06:48.643
But with the feminine energy, I don't know, I got a gay vibe,

06:48.750 --> 06:51.265
I'm gender-blind, that's the thing, and that's something

06:51.328 --> 06:55.720
that I'm gonna have to work on at Brown next year when we go together,

06:55.831 --> 06:56.695
when we go together.

06:56.781 --> 06:58.439
Okay, I'm gonna see you later. I got to go.

06:58.566 --> 07:00.089
- Cohen.
- We'll talk after school.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.202
Wow, somebody was really craving caffeine.

07:11.302 --> 07:13.611
Oh, yeah. I can barely keep my eyes open.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.185
Early morning wake-up call, courtesy of Seth.

07:16.304 --> 07:17.541
Oh, has he told Summer yet?

07:17.660 --> 07:18.941
No, and he's not going to.

07:19.055 --> 07:22.323
By the way, I promised that, um, we'd keep quiet about it,

07:22.409 --> 07:23.975
as long as he told her about the interview.

07:24.079 --> 07:27.810
Oh, I was looking forward to Summer bitch-slapping Kaitlin for giving Seth pot.

07:28.061 --> 07:30.162
Guess she's just gonna get away with it, like always.

07:30.248 --> 07:33.966
You know, it's for the best. I mean, she screwed up, but she's still pretty much a kid.

07:34.081 --> 07:36.101
Yeah. But with my mom's DNA.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.227
Which means she's capable of more than you think.

07:41.332 --> 07:44.771
Um... are we still talking about Seth, or...

07:44.947 --> 07:46.733
This is just sister stuff.

07:51.016 --> 07:53.534
You know, I should probably get to class. See you later.

07:53.676 --> 07:54.512
Okay.

07:55.744 --> 07:57.231
It's "just sister stuff"?

08:03.789 --> 08:05.833
Okay, let's practice your pop-up one more time.

08:06.276 --> 08:09.187
When you told me you were gonna give me a surfing lesson,

08:09.273 --> 08:11.307
I kind of imagined us in the water.

08:11.396 --> 08:13.920
No, no. First lesson's always on the sand.

08:14.050 --> 08:15.927
As long as we're skipping the water part,

08:16.035 --> 08:18.051
why don't we just do this back at your place?

08:18.183 --> 08:20.078
Or we could just blow the whole thing off.

08:20.188 --> 08:22.870
Rent a movie, order in pancakes.

08:23.602 --> 08:25.298
I thought you said you wanted to learn how to surf.

08:25.382 --> 08:27.753
I'm not training for the Olympics, okay?

08:30.844 --> 08:31.699
Sorry.

08:32.701 --> 08:33.943
I'm just distracted.

08:34.852 --> 08:36.162
Thinking about Marissa.

08:37.438 --> 08:38.854
Story of my life.

08:38.985 --> 08:42.284
I like a guy, he's in love with my older sister...

08:42.525 --> 08:45.126
Look, Marissa and I have a history together, all right?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.899
It's... just complicated.

08:47.993 --> 08:49.293
Uncomplicate it.

08:49.682 --> 08:50.564
Do something.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.984
I can't do anything.

08:52.334 --> 08:53.540
It's not my place.

08:53.774 --> 08:56.825
If you're too lame to do something, I'll just find somebody who will.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.310
I thought this was a done deal.

09:05.399 --> 09:07.383
Miriam already gave us the hospital contract.

09:07.493 --> 09:10.687
He did. And now he has to present it to the Board of Physicians.

09:10.828 --> 09:12.763
Can't have a hospital without doctors.

09:12.996 --> 09:14.540
Like or not, they got a say.

09:14.750 --> 09:18.072
Right. Now we have to ply more people with women and liquor.

09:18.205 --> 09:19.799
I don't think that's gonna work.

09:19.932 --> 09:21.450
These guys are doctors, not businessmen.

09:21.554 --> 09:22.927
Then we got that in common.

09:23.048 --> 09:26.453
Call it willful naiveté, call it bleary-eyed optimism.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.579
You think we've got a shot.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.533
Yeah.

09:29.660 --> 09:32.590
There's over 100,000 uninsured that live in Orange County.

09:32.694 --> 09:37.212
There's got to be some angle we can find to make that land on these guys.

09:38.289 --> 09:39.527
Well, there is.

09:39.696 --> 09:41.861
The head of the board, Henry Griffin.

09:41.974 --> 09:45.484
Turns out we have a... a personal connection.

09:45.615 --> 09:47.937
Well, now, there's a shocking turn of events.

09:48.062 --> 09:48.930
It's his daughter, Maya.

09:49.026 --> 09:50.536
She's a stripper, too?

09:50.788 --> 09:52.926
No, she was a year ahead of me at Kellogg.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.174
Now she's one of its most trusted advisors.

09:55.299 --> 09:57.035
And she used to have a thing for me.

09:57.758 --> 09:59.476
Well, who could blame her?

09:59.855 --> 10:01.894
So now you want to wine and dine her,

10:01.997 --> 10:04.035
use her affection for you to manipulate her father.

10:04.135 --> 10:06.794
Listen, it's no worse than the strippers we got for Bill Miriam.

10:07.393 --> 10:10.017
Oh, I don't know. I draw the line at family, Matt.

10:10.101 --> 10:11.217
How about this?

10:11.325 --> 10:15.150
How about we find a strategy that doesn't involve liquor

10:15.269 --> 10:16.862
or sexual favors?

10:27.340 --> 10:28.399
Thank you.

10:28.871 --> 10:30.205
I mean, gracias.

10:31.485 --> 10:32.089
Julie?

10:32.200 --> 10:32.974
Hi.

10:33.150 --> 10:36.008
Uh, your receptionist told me you'd be home today,

10:36.109 --> 10:41.034
so I thought I'd come by and personally thank you for hosting Kaitlin's birthday party.

10:41.147 --> 10:43.535
And as a token of my appreciation...

10:47.773 --> 10:49.439
Bachelorettes of Newport?

10:50.946 --> 10:52.147
You want to set me up?

10:52.305 --> 10:55.549
Well, unless... you don't want to be set up.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.934
Well, I hadn't really thought about it.

10:59.044 --> 11:03.230
Because I can totally understand if a blind date seems like too much.

11:07.060 --> 11:08.632
Let's see what you have there.

11:15.058 --> 11:17.375
New match. Wow, she's pretty.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.081
Mmm, pear shaped.

11:19.523 --> 11:20.440
But pretty.

11:21.770 --> 11:25.501
Ooh. Look at her, nice... smile.

11:25.610 --> 11:27.618
Yeah. Adult braces.

11:27.727 --> 11:28.743
And her...

11:29.830 --> 11:32.602
Julie, all of these women look fantastic.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.685
It's going to take me a while to choose one.

11:35.026 --> 11:36.506
Do you mind if I get back to you?

11:46.410 --> 11:48.224
Finally, you're home.

11:48.589 --> 11:50.237
What'd you do, take the scenic route?

11:50.338 --> 11:52.449
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were waiting for me.

11:52.984 --> 11:57.206
Well, I just get kind of lonely while you guys are all at school.

11:57.298 --> 12:00.198
Speaking of school, shouldn't you be going back to yours soon?

12:00.304 --> 12:01.830
How many times do I have to tell you guys?

12:01.931 --> 12:03.389
It's called mid-winter break.

12:03.487 --> 12:04.598
It's long.

12:04.908 --> 12:05.907
Apparently.

12:06.511 --> 12:08.635
Look, I want to talk to you about Marissa.

12:08.748 --> 12:11.125
This whole Johnny triangle we're all trapped in.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.206
Triangle?

12:12.324 --> 12:15.354
Well, now that I'm here, it's more like a square.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.250
Well, anyway, see, I like him.

12:18.352 --> 12:21.949
And I'm not getting anywhere because he thinks he's got a chance with Marissa.

12:23.178 --> 12:26.603
Well, not that that's any of your business, but it's not the case.

12:26.702 --> 12:27.694
I don't know.

12:27.822 --> 12:31.881
See, today I asked her if she had feelings for him point blank.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.543
She didn't deny it.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.399
Well, thanks for the heads up.

12:38.499 --> 12:40.163
I think Marissa and I can handle it ourselves.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.883
So if you just want to...

12:41.994 --> 12:44.535
Ryan, I want you to do something about it.

12:44.641 --> 12:46.862
I mean, you're a man of action.

12:47.001 --> 12:49.664
You throw punches at fires.

12:49.784 --> 12:51.632
At least that's the guy I remember from two years ago.

12:51.742 --> 12:52.925
We've all grown up since then.

12:53.026 --> 12:54.182
So you're reformed now?

12:54.289 --> 12:55.702
Congratulations.

12:55.805 --> 12:57.796
Doesn't mean you still can't talk to her.

12:58.173 --> 13:00.419
So you can hook up with Johnny?

13:00.986 --> 13:02.678
You  get something out of it, too.

13:02.925 --> 13:04.716
You get to find out where you stand...

13:05.219 --> 13:06.821
once and for all.

13:28.103 --> 13:31.037
Ryan, hey. Is everything okay?

13:31.100 --> 13:32.795
'Cause you sounded really weird on the phone.

13:32.891 --> 13:34.776
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.044
So I take it Kaitlin paid you a visit.

13:38.147 --> 13:39.367
This isn't about Kaitlin.

13:39.542 --> 13:42.339
We both knew this was an issue long before she showed up.

13:44.311 --> 13:45.476
I'm with you.

13:45.864 --> 13:47.696
But that's not the whole story, is it?

13:53.161 --> 13:56.640
Maybe you just feel sorry for him or...

13:57.229 --> 14:00.847
maybe sometimes you didn't think you can talk to me...

14:01.725 --> 14:03.171
or I wasn't listening...

14:04.746 --> 14:06.268
or maybe you're in love with him.

14:07.692 --> 14:10.317
Either way, you got to figure it out. Until then, I...

14:11.273 --> 14:12.561
I don't want to see you.

14:18.051 --> 14:20.402
Look, I know things have been confusing...

14:37.847 --> 14:39.157
Hey. Morning.

14:40.612 --> 14:44.192
Oh, no, the Atwood grunt. That's never a good sign.

14:44.612 --> 14:48.201
What's the matter? I'm going to guess. Marissa. Or Johnny.

14:48.318 --> 14:50.045
Maybe Kaitlin.

14:50.149 --> 14:52.319
I'm going to say probably a combo platter.

14:52.436 --> 14:54.391
I think Marissa and I are on thin ice.

14:55.951 --> 14:58.950
She needs to figure out her relationship with Johnny pronto.

14:59.122 --> 15:02.249
She's, uh, got good taste in people. I'm sure she'll do the right thing.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.867
Speaking of the right thing...

15:04.784 --> 15:07.580
Um... I tried to talk to Summer.

15:07.684 --> 15:08.089
And?

15:08.197 --> 15:11.513
I  chickened out. Which is kind of my go-to move these days.

15:11.615 --> 15:14.275
But I'm going to take care of it. And I'm rescheduling the interview.

15:14.383 --> 15:16.952
Think they're going to let you take it again after you blew the first one off?

15:17.076 --> 15:19.485
Well, for the first one I had an epileptic fit.

15:19.608 --> 15:23.696
And  there was a three-car pileup on the freeway with a jackknifed trailer truck, so...

15:25.947 --> 15:28.815
- All right, I'll work on my excuse.
- That's a good idea.

15:35.177 --> 15:38.342
Oh, Kaitlin, you're up. I was just making some grits.

15:38.465 --> 15:42.179
Okay. Mom, we get it. We live in a trailer park.

15:42.286 --> 15:44.061
There's no need to go overboard.

15:44.272 --> 15:46.050
Marissa, you want some?

15:46.367 --> 15:47.816
I'm not hungry.

15:48.170 --> 15:49.031
Fine.

15:49.221 --> 15:53.273
I'll go see if Gus likes these. I mean, he does eat pigeons after all.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.341
Be right back.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.621
I'd kill for some Apple Jacks. Do you think we have any?

15:58.742 --> 16:02.696
Kaitlin, you had no right to talk to Ryan about my relationship with Johnny.

16:02.816 --> 16:04.117
It's none of your business.

16:04.244 --> 16:05.866
I was just sharing my opinion.

16:05.977 --> 16:07.336
What did I ever do to you?

16:07.451 --> 16:09.593
I mean, I know Mom ignores you and Dad left.

16:09.698 --> 16:11.493
Okay, let's not turn this into family therapy.

16:11.587 --> 16:13.700
Okay, then let's not pretend this is all about Johnny.

16:13.805 --> 16:14.901
What else would this be about?

16:15.009 --> 16:16.904
Come on, you're doing this to punish me.

16:17.806 --> 16:20.021
You know, I was actually happy when you came home.

16:20.134 --> 16:21.548
I thought we were gonna be friends again.

16:21.661 --> 16:23.669
But now I just can't wait for you to leave.

16:50.117 --> 16:54.529
Summer... I just got off the phone with Mr. Spivey from Brown.

16:54.616 --> 16:56.404
Looks like you've got a fan.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.126
Oh, great.

16:58.315 --> 17:01.007
You know, I was actually just curious. Did he mention how I went with Seth?

17:01.127 --> 17:01.848
Seth Cohen?

17:01.957 --> 17:04.471
Yeah. You know, gangly, mop-head, barely has an ass.

17:04.580 --> 17:08.570
Right. Um... unfortunately, Seth missed his interview.

17:08.678 --> 17:10.056
- What?
- He was a no-show.

17:10.147 --> 17:14.402
He was just in here explaining the situation. Something about a tractor-trailer accident.

17:14.526 --> 17:16.611
Oh, my God, that little bitch.

17:16.709 --> 17:17.664
Excuse me?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.933
I'm sorry. Thank you for your help.

17:24.813 --> 17:28.918
Well... I finally heard from Dr. Roberts.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.238
That's great.

17:32.112 --> 17:32.828
Or not.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.030
He had me set him up with Laura Cross.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.812
They'll be eating at Al Fiorno's, a table by the window.

17:37.913 --> 17:38.945
Oh, Julie, I'm sorry.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.946
Oh, no, it's my own fault.

17:41.058 --> 17:43.860
I let you do the scheming, clearly not your wheel house.

17:43.969 --> 17:47.700
From now on, if someone needs to be manipulated, we put me in charge.

17:47.806 --> 17:49.017
Fair enough.

17:50.424 --> 17:52.558
Laura Cross... I don't know her.

17:52.656 --> 17:56.756
Well, she'll probably marry him and enjoy a life of free brow lifts.

17:56.876 --> 18:00.828
Anyway... I am going to get to know her and find out what I'm up against.

18:00.928 --> 18:02.845
Don't tell me you're going to spy on them.

18:02.956 --> 18:07.012
I tried taking your advice, Kiki, and quite frankly, it sucked.

18:07.109 --> 18:10.584
From now on, we do things the Julie Cooper way.

18:12.512 --> 18:14.205
Julie Cooper, be careful.

18:18.144 --> 18:19.648
I see we have a problem.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.513
Chili, man, I'm fine, all right, I just...

18:21.612 --> 18:23.071
In love with Marissa Cooper.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.741
My friend, in all my years of loving ladies and getting nothing in return

18:27.829 --> 18:30.135
I have never been as bad off as you.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.035
Thanks, man. Makes me feel a lot better.

18:33.122 --> 18:36.546
Normally... I would advise you to go cold turkey.

18:36.695 --> 18:39.496
Delete her number from your cell, spam-block her e-mails,

18:39.582 --> 18:40.925
and just hope that the obsession passes.

18:41.021 --> 18:43.960
But I see that you are in deeper than this.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.054
So what do I do?

18:46.182 --> 18:47.321
You take a shot.

18:47.658 --> 18:50.889
That way, even if she rejects you, at least you know you tried.

18:51.021 --> 18:54.990
Yeah, and there's always a chance that she feels the same way, right?

18:55.106 --> 18:56.403
Reasons abound.

18:56.517 --> 19:01.013
The point is, you owe it to yourself to at least know whether or not she likes you.

19:09.414 --> 19:10.986
You could have a drink tonight.

19:11.592 --> 19:12.539
You sure?

19:12.710 --> 19:14.688
Well, you've had a tough day.

19:16.649 --> 19:18.077
So has Matt.

19:18.184 --> 19:20.546
Looks like he's come here to drown his sorrows.

19:20.674 --> 19:24.154
Oh. Well, you should ask him to join us if he's all by himself.

19:26.528 --> 19:27.726
Or not.

19:28.797 --> 19:30.773
Ah, that's Maya Griffin.

19:30.950 --> 19:32.701
O.C. Weekly just did a profile on her.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.091
Apparently she's an up-and-coming Newpsie.

19:35.455 --> 19:37.373
Wow, I have too much time on my hands.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.849
Well, if she's the new queen, she's still got a lot to learn.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.498
Well, why wouldn't she date him? He's young and attractive.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.795
He's using her.

19:43.972 --> 19:46.151
Her father's the head of the board.

19:46.908 --> 19:48.321
Are you going to talk to him?

19:51.833 --> 19:52.806
Tomorrow.

19:52.952 --> 19:57.359
Tonight, I'm out with my lovely, beautiful, morally uncompromised wife.

19:57.944 --> 20:00.919
We could go to the Crab Shack, pick up something to go.

20:01.047 --> 20:04.215
Sand dabs are in season. Genius.

20:11.026 --> 20:11.983
Hey.

20:12.667 --> 20:13.474
Hey.

20:13.791 --> 20:14.701
Thanks for meeting me.

20:14.817 --> 20:16.712
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you, too.

20:16.835 --> 20:17.708
Things have been...

20:17.830 --> 20:20.469
Really weird between us. I know. Um...

20:20.578 --> 20:22.748
That's just why I wanted to get everything out in the open.

20:22.835 --> 20:24.829
Johnny, I don't know if now's the time to...

20:24.921 --> 20:27.181
I love you... and I think you love me, too.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.126
Johnny...

20:28.303 --> 20:30.369
Look, okay, look what's happened between us.

20:30.478 --> 20:33.935
I mean, I got hurt and you took care of me even when I begged you not to.

20:34.034 --> 20:36.519
I know. That's true. But...

20:36.612 --> 20:40.002
I told you to stay away from me and you showed up at my house.

20:40.117 --> 20:41.850
I'm not imagining this, okay?

20:41.956 --> 20:43.676
There's something real between us.

20:43.783 --> 20:45.783
That's why neither of us can walk away.

20:49.941 --> 20:54.175
Look... you don't have to say anything right now, okay?

20:54.451 --> 20:57.176
Just, you know, think about it.

21:11.555 --> 21:12.226
Morning.

21:12.353 --> 21:12.982
Morning.

21:13.127 --> 21:13.932
Hi, Ryan.

21:14.068 --> 21:14.788
Feel like a bagel?

21:14.892 --> 21:15.613
I do, thank you.

21:15.715 --> 21:17.204
Ah, there's my son.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.222
How are you?

21:18.331 --> 21:20.702
Good. Do we have poppy? Oh, great.

21:21.907 --> 21:23.180
How are you really?

21:23.288 --> 21:26.853
Uh... I'm really fine, Dad. How are you?

21:26.959 --> 21:29.313
I'm good. I'm good. Just making sure you're staying afloat.

21:29.414 --> 21:32.366
I know you got a lot of stress. Exams, college applications.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.235
Yeah, no, not to worry. It's all under control.

21:36.367 --> 21:37.546
Oh, hey, Summer.

21:37.867 --> 21:38.539
Hi.

21:38.679 --> 21:39.877
Just in time for breakfast.

21:39.983 --> 21:41.468
Oh, thanks, Mr. C.

21:41.569 --> 21:46.530
Actually, I was wondering if I could talk to Seth upstairs... um, possibly alone.

21:46.714 --> 21:47.769
Okay.

21:52.862 --> 21:55.445
All right, so... Ow! What the hell?

21:55.542 --> 21:58.176
You lied about your college interview, and I don't like liars!

21:58.267 --> 21:59.297
I can explain.

21:59.389 --> 22:01.140
Explain what, that you're pathological?

22:01.218 --> 22:04.346
That you invent stories about college interviews that never even happened?

22:04.436 --> 22:06.025
You make it sounds so bad.

22:06.581 --> 22:10.281
Cohen, you are in a deceit spiral, and if you don't stop now,

22:10.363 --> 22:13.247
you could turn into one of those creepy old men who have secret attics

22:13.330 --> 22:15.146
where they hide stolen money and porn.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.204
Okay, first of all, that sounds awesome.

22:17.312 --> 22:19.310
Second of all, could be worse.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.347
I got scared.

22:22.448 --> 22:23.555
Scared?

22:24.374 --> 22:25.355
Yeah.

22:26.517 --> 22:30.302
Tongue-tied, uh, dizzy. My bladder felt weak.

22:30.596 --> 22:32.409
I just want to know why you didn't tell me.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.444
Because I was embarrassed.

22:34.832 --> 22:38.844
You've got this natural confidence. You're small and you're cute. People like you.

22:38.947 --> 22:41.963
I'm a social outcast with a mumbling problem.

22:46.464 --> 22:47.815
You're just realizing this now?

22:47.884 --> 22:51.066
Well, if we go to college together, everybody's going to love you,

22:51.153 --> 22:53.151
and I'm going to be your nerdy boyfriend.

22:53.265 --> 22:55.920
And I'm going to be your not-so-bright girlfriend that can't keep up

22:56.006 --> 22:59.517
when everyone's talking about Yakuza films and Prowst.

22:59.617 --> 23:00.586
It's Proust.

23:00.692 --> 23:01.582
See?

23:02.900 --> 23:07.841
Look, we have to be honest with each other, or this is never going to work.

23:09.517 --> 23:10.620
No, you're right.

23:11.628 --> 23:13.676
So is there anything else you need to tell me?

23:13.777 --> 23:16.372
'Cause now's your chance. Just put it out on the table.

23:18.348 --> 23:19.217
No.

23:22.498 --> 23:23.425
Okay.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.555
Then you are officially exonerated.

23:27.777 --> 23:28.789
Thesaurus again.

23:35.850 --> 23:37.008
You want to get down?

23:38.919 --> 23:39.789
Hey.

23:40.343 --> 23:41.918
I didn't know we were working this weekend.

23:42.034 --> 23:43.364
I thought maybe you and I would go hit the links.

23:43.466 --> 23:45.577
What, and ruin a sport I love?

23:46.188 --> 23:48.914
It's the weekend, so I'm going to make this brief as I know how.

23:49.013 --> 23:51.536
I was at dinner last night with Kirsten at the Yacht Club.

23:51.832 --> 23:53.299
I saw you there...

23:54.051 --> 23:55.153
with Maya.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.904
Henry Griffin told Maya about meeting with me,

24:00.012 --> 24:01.334
so she decided to get in touch.

24:01.453 --> 24:02.951
She asked you to dinner.

24:03.065 --> 24:04.181
She did.

24:04.991 --> 24:07.552
Why? Is it illegal to take a girl out to dinner?

24:08.128 --> 24:10.657
You know, when Kirsten used to run this place,

24:10.845 --> 24:15.390
I saw a lot of creeps in nice suits that used to try to use her to get to her father.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.151
I didn't like it then,

24:17.285 --> 24:18.838
and I don't like it now.

24:18.995 --> 24:21.763
We're trying to build a hospital that could service 100,000 uninsured.

24:21.870 --> 24:24.814
You're trying to use a daughter to manipulate her father...

24:24.937 --> 24:26.839
and you're comfortable with that.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.319
Look, Sandy, you're a great guy,

24:30.476 --> 24:32.545
but maybe you don't have the stomach for this.

24:32.675 --> 24:35.099
All I'm saying is that we're going to have to bend the rules if we want to win the game.

24:35.227 --> 24:37.571
That'd look great on a bumper sticker.

24:37.785 --> 24:40.476
I want to see you on Monday with a real game plan.

24:40.594 --> 24:41.611
All right.

24:47.574 --> 24:48.462
Hey.

24:48.897 --> 24:51.049
Um... Kirsten let me in.

24:51.137 --> 24:52.267
She seems really nice.

24:52.385 --> 24:53.451
What do you want?

24:58.462 --> 25:01.887
Look, um... you've always been a really good guy to me.

25:02.025 --> 25:05.593
You know, you've helped me with Volchek, trusted me with Marissa...

25:05.680 --> 25:06.945
Now you're in love with her.

25:08.268 --> 25:09.371
I told her.

25:11.393 --> 25:15.156
I-I promised myself I-I would just live with these feelings, you know--

25:16.009 --> 25:19.010
I wouldn't do anything about them, but, um...

25:19.592 --> 25:21.486
I just can't do that anymore.

25:24.006 --> 25:25.589
What, do you want my blessing?

25:27.712 --> 25:29.340
I guess I just...

25:30.422 --> 25:32.095
just wanted to say I'm sorry.

25:33.204 --> 25:34.154
Thanks for that.

25:35.044 --> 25:36.139
Leave now.

25:43.626 --> 25:47.545
Well, I'm passionately devoted to my work on the board of the Children's Museum.

25:47.659 --> 25:50.387
Children are so important, don't you think?

25:50.506 --> 25:52.791
Oh, she's so phony.

25:52.911 --> 25:55.524
Well, of course she is. She lives in Newport.

25:57.541 --> 26:00.547
Oh, God, mayday. Taryn Baker just walked in.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.784
Well, you'd better get out of there before she sees you.

26:02.882 --> 26:04.079
Dinner with you, apparently.

26:04.728 --> 26:06.087
Oh, too late.

26:06.643 --> 26:07.507
Hi, Taryn.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.720
Why are you all bundled up like that?

26:09.824 --> 26:12.214
Has Newport been taken over by the Taliban?

26:12.324 --> 26:14.384
I'd really love to stay and chat, but I have to be going...

26:14.491 --> 26:16.606
Oh, my goodness, it's Laura Cross!

26:16.710 --> 26:17.983
Laura, hi!

26:18.081 --> 26:20.151
It's me, Taryn, from Orchid Club.

26:20.252 --> 26:21.934
Oh, Taryn, of course.

26:22.045 --> 26:22.805
Do you know Julie?

26:22.901 --> 26:23.665
I have to go.

26:23.762 --> 26:24.580
We haven't met.

26:24.685 --> 26:25.388
Julie?

26:25.490 --> 26:26.629
Julie?

26:27.610 --> 26:30.078
Oh, my! What a coincidence.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.713
Have you been sitting at the next table this whole time?

26:33.905 --> 26:35.403
Are you spying on me?

26:36.734 --> 26:38.790
Uh... I...

26:39.218 --> 26:40.289
I'm sorry.

26:49.943 --> 26:50.877
Hey.

26:52.690 --> 26:55.052
There's a sale at Paul Frank if you want to go.

26:55.657 --> 26:59.619
Probably can't afford anything, but we could try stuff on.

26:59.989 --> 27:01.091
No thanks.

27:02.223 --> 27:04.157
I'm guessing you're still mad at me.

27:04.690 --> 27:08.810
Look, I know you may not believe me when I say this, but I'm trying to do you a favor.

27:08.923 --> 27:10.524
Oh, yeah? Well, thanks.

27:10.644 --> 27:12.735
So far, it's been a real blast.

27:16.250 --> 27:20.264
Remember when we were little, and Dad used to always take us to Baskin-Robbins?

27:20.399 --> 27:22.382
You'd have to sample, like, every single flavor

27:22.473 --> 27:25.051
before you could decide on what you actually wanted,

27:25.204 --> 27:29.590
and then once you did, you realized that you didn't like it, so you'd cry.

27:29.876 --> 27:31.698
Dad would have to take you back in to get another cone.

27:31.782 --> 27:34.549
Is this another story about how growing up, it was always about me?

27:34.659 --> 27:35.513
No.

27:35.711 --> 27:38.046
It's about you not trusting your instincts.

27:40.697 --> 27:42.398
Maybe I'm not built that way.

27:42.510 --> 27:45.282
So? It's a skill. Learn it.

27:45.383 --> 27:47.277
Make a decision and stick with it.

27:51.189 --> 27:52.911
Remember what I used to always get?

27:53.020 --> 27:54.316
Gold Medal Ribbon.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.490
Every time.

27:55.763 --> 27:57.126
I figured I loved it--

27:57.966 --> 27:59.109
why question it?

28:20.567 --> 28:23.042
Honey, you just missed Marissa.

28:23.155 --> 28:23.959
Marissa?

28:24.087 --> 28:24.856
Yeah.

28:24.975 --> 28:26.362
She left this for you.

28:44.426 --> 28:45.443
I'm sorry.

28:50.151 --> 28:51.450
You want to be with Johnny.

28:53.721 --> 28:56.383
No, I'm sorry I ever made you wonder.

28:58.227 --> 29:00.957
Look, you two have a connection. I get that. It's not even about him.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.855
No, it's... it's about me.

29:07.086 --> 29:08.382
I was just...

29:09.183 --> 29:11.406
not being able to talk to you about Trey.

29:12.806 --> 29:17.229
And then with Kaitlin coming back, her hooking up with Johnny, it just...

29:18.408 --> 29:19.978
it threw me for a loop.

29:20.447 --> 29:21.697
But I think we can get past that.

29:21.811 --> 29:23.419
It's not that easy. You can't just snap your fingers

29:23.505 --> 29:25.687
and make everything go back the way it was before.

29:26.472 --> 29:28.034
Well, we can try.

29:29.091 --> 29:30.713
Maybe start with dinner?

29:57.940 --> 29:58.879
Johnny.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.047
Which Cooper are you here to see?

30:02.280 --> 30:03.527
I'm here to see you.

30:03.651 --> 30:05.336
I thought maybe we could go to the beach.

30:05.465 --> 30:07.031
For a night surfing lesson?

30:07.163 --> 30:10.005
I was thinking more like bonfire and tequila.

30:11.027 --> 30:14.355
Even better. Know where my mom keeps the stash.

30:17.494 --> 30:18.727
So, what's the occasion?

30:19.179 --> 30:22.412
Just feel like you and I never really got a chance to party.

30:22.524 --> 30:23.189
What do you say?

30:23.295 --> 30:24.126
Okay.

30:35.418 --> 30:36.170
Hungry?

30:36.295 --> 30:38.597
Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I...

30:39.268 --> 30:40.455
I should've called.

30:40.579 --> 30:41.990
Oh, it's okay.

30:42.296 --> 30:43.937
I figured you were here.

30:45.119 --> 30:48.650
Who would've thought the Newport Group would be where I go to for a moment of zen?

30:48.773 --> 30:49.743
I know.

30:49.933 --> 30:53.890
Sometimes this job makes you do a lot of hard thinking.

30:55.732 --> 31:00.031
I want this hospital more than I've wanted anything in a long time.

31:01.377 --> 31:05.686
Then you can't let Matt's relationship with Maya Griffin stand in your way.

31:05.798 --> 31:09.535
For all you know, she could be using him, too, or they could live happily ever after.

31:09.647 --> 31:13.815
The point is if you want this as bad as I think you do,

31:14.305 --> 31:15.730
you have to go for it.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.477
So where's the line?

31:18.610 --> 31:21.111
I'm not worried about you knowing where the line is.

31:21.234 --> 31:22.511
You always do.

31:22.852 --> 31:23.971
It's who you are.

31:41.901 --> 31:42.850
Coming!

31:45.480 --> 31:46.392
Cohen!

31:46.684 --> 31:47.800
Hang on...

31:50.617 --> 31:52.506
Cohen, why is the door locked?

31:52.626 --> 31:55.106
Cohen, I brought some DVDs.

31:59.025 --> 32:00.584
Save the Last Dance and She's All That.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.193
Now, I know you're not interested in either of them,

32:02.269 --> 32:05.129
but I cannot watch another movie about Japanese people flying through the air.

32:05.195 --> 32:06.713
Okay, that's fine. Let's go downstairs.

32:06.803 --> 32:08.679
Wait, what? That's fine, but are you okay?

32:08.772 --> 32:09.491
Yeah, I'm great. Come on.

32:09.583 --> 32:10.438
What's that smell?

32:10.550 --> 32:13.464
It is incense. I was doing yoga, plus I had some really bad gas.

32:13.504 --> 32:14.420
Gross.

32:32.066 --> 32:36.155
Oh, God, wish I'd brought something to mix it with.

32:39.013 --> 32:42.591
Couple more sips, you won't even notice.

32:43.338 --> 32:45.215
Okay, alkie.

32:47.367 --> 32:49.024
Can we just hook up already?

32:49.154 --> 32:51.695
Or, before you pass out on me.

32:52.449 --> 32:54.356
You don't waste any time, do you?

32:54.468 --> 32:55.939
Well, it's just the fire.

32:56.137 --> 32:57.648
It's so romantic.

32:58.250 --> 33:02.041
Well, the fire is, actually, kind of dying.

33:04.379 --> 33:06.574
Well, okay then.

33:06.782 --> 33:09.071
I'll just go find some driftwood.

33:09.205 --> 33:10.411
Heat things up a bit.

33:47.674 --> 33:48.647
What's that?

33:52.727 --> 33:54.058
Nothing I want to remember.

34:15.777 --> 34:16.830
Where are you going?

34:17.195 --> 34:18.387
To climb up there.

34:18.721 --> 34:23.485
Okay, tequila and rock climbing, I'm not exactly sure that's the best combination.

34:23.618 --> 34:24.693
So don't come.

34:26.572 --> 34:28.061
Johnny, wait.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.154
Go away, Gus.

34:53.004 --> 34:55.558
I told you, I don't play strip pinochle.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.514
You play strip pinochle?

35:00.909 --> 35:02.582
Long story. What...

35:02.994 --> 35:04.316
What are you doing here?

35:04.592 --> 35:07.197
I stopped by to thank you for fixing me up with Laura.

35:07.329 --> 35:09.020
She's a wonderful woman.

35:11.049 --> 35:15.043
Well, good. I'm glad it worked out with the two of you.

35:16.077 --> 35:18.741
If you'll excuse me, I have a Hot Pocket in the microwave

35:18.821 --> 35:22.414
and a wine cooler with my name on it, so good luck.

35:23.113 --> 35:25.387
What? What do you want?

35:26.118 --> 35:26.991
You.

35:27.665 --> 35:28.731
Excuse me?

35:29.241 --> 35:33.087
You can be manipulative, you can be aggressive,

35:33.664 --> 35:37.151
I've know you to stretch the truth on occasion.

35:37.966 --> 35:41.582
But the fact is, when I'm not around you, I miss you.

35:42.996 --> 35:44.145
You do?

35:46.685 --> 35:47.751
What can I say?

35:50.925 --> 35:52.441
I've fallen for you.

35:58.130 --> 36:02.457
Well... this just may be your lucky night.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.837
I have an extra Hot Pocket.

36:12.609 --> 36:15.068
Johnny, would you just come down already?

36:15.175 --> 36:15.905
You're wasted.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.199
No, I'm not wasted.

36:17.297 --> 36:18.674
Johnny, just come down.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.106
Stop it, that's high enought.

36:21.201 --> 36:22.097
I'm not gonna fall.

36:22.193 --> 36:23.624
You're scaring me.

36:24.024 --> 36:25.824
I got it. You're awesome.

36:25.929 --> 36:27.226
Just stop!

36:27.511 --> 36:28.573
Johnny!

36:29.083 --> 36:30.562
It's okay.

36:30.806 --> 36:31.909
Johnny!

36:34.132 --> 36:35.555
Did you see?

36:35.657 --> 36:37.357
Johnny, just come down.

36:37.491 --> 36:38.972
I almost dropped it.

36:40.869 --> 36:42.657
It's okay, I got it.

36:42.956 --> 36:46.177
Johnny, please! Just come down.

36:50.183 --> 36:52.238
Seth's really into that movie.

36:52.421 --> 36:55.013
Yeah, I know, and he ate all of our dumplings.

37:02.369 --> 37:05.883
Look, I know it's gonna take more than Thai food and teen movies to sort this out,

37:05.987 --> 37:08.434
but if you want to talk...

37:10.706 --> 37:12.803
Talking is the last thing I feel like doing.

37:13.522 --> 37:16.674
I figured, since you gave me the silent treatment the whole way in the car.

37:18.393 --> 37:19.700
What do you want from me?

37:27.663 --> 37:29.300
I want you.

38:04.788 --> 38:05.579
You want to answer that?

38:05.699 --> 38:06.932
Not really.

38:07.668 --> 38:08.522
Wait.

38:10.064 --> 38:11.023
It's Kaitlin.

38:11.141 --> 38:12.752
Ah, she's setting the mood.

38:16.565 --> 38:19.128
All right, let me just get rid of her.

38:19.249 --> 38:20.706
Setting the mood.

38:20.908 --> 38:21.996
Tell her that...

38:22.588 --> 38:24.377
Wait. Kaitlin, let me call you back.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.080
Marissa, can you come and get me?

38:26.194 --> 38:27.485
I'm at Westward Cove with Johnny.

38:27.585 --> 38:28.669
No, I'm busy.

38:28.707 --> 38:29.904
You're getting busy.

38:30.093 --> 38:32.720
No, but you don't understand. I'm scared.

38:32.821 --> 38:35.079
He's drunk and he's acting like a crazy person.

38:35.185 --> 38:36.502
Hey, come up here!

38:36.608 --> 38:38.056
You got to see this view!

38:38.160 --> 38:39.865
Johnny, just come down.

38:39.958 --> 38:42.653
What's that? Marissa, it's him, I'm telling you.

38:42.766 --> 38:45.222
Johnny's in trouble and I don't know what to do.

38:45.329 --> 38:46.665
Um, hold on.

38:46.789 --> 38:48.414
She sounds really upset.

38:48.508 --> 38:49.085
It's Johnny?

38:49.186 --> 38:50.468
Yeah, he's in trouble.

38:51.284 --> 38:51.911
Kaitlin?

38:52.013 --> 38:55.323
Ryan, you have to help me. He's drunk and he's gonna get hurt.

38:55.414 --> 38:56.112
He's really in trouble?

38:56.204 --> 38:57.333
Yes. Come now.

38:57.429 --> 38:58.432
We'll be right there.

38:59.908 --> 39:00.842
Wow.

39:01.422 --> 39:05.208
So that was, um... that was Save the Last Dance, uh?

39:05.336 --> 39:08.443
Okay, I know there weren't any subtitles or kung fu or whatever,

39:08.540 --> 39:11.328
- but I thought it was pretty good.
- No, I thought it was amazing.

39:11.502 --> 39:14.856
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.

39:14.950 --> 39:17.805
And Summer, I'm so glad...

39:17.918 --> 39:24.075
I'm so, so glad, that she got into Julliard in the end.

39:24.183 --> 39:27.721
And she did it for her mom.

39:29.073 --> 39:33.034
For her mom, Summer.

39:33.194 --> 39:34.921
Yeah, it wasn't that good.

39:37.313 --> 39:38.898
This is pretty amazing, too.

39:41.449 --> 39:42.825
It's just a blue screen, Cohen.

39:42.937 --> 39:44.618
I know, but it's so blue.

39:44.723 --> 39:47.687
I never realized how blue it was before.

39:47.751 --> 39:51.537
I kind of, like, want to go swimming in it or something.

39:51.940 --> 39:52.583
Yeah.

39:52.689 --> 39:53.711
For a little dippy-dip.

39:53.816 --> 39:55.664
Okay, it's pretty blue.

39:55.785 --> 39:56.655
Yeah.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.147
Could you excuse me, I got to go to the bathroom.

39:58.241 --> 39:59.743
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

40:04.452 --> 40:06.009
I'm not going anywhere.

40:07.195 --> 40:10.099
We should, we should take our pants off.

40:16.139 --> 40:17.606
Come on, Captain Oats.

40:17.727 --> 40:19.769
We both know something's up.

40:42.333 --> 40:43.359
Ew.

40:55.443 --> 40:56.509
Over there.

40:56.610 --> 40:58.237
You go to Kaitlin. I'm gonna find another way up there.

40:58.324 --> 41:00.277
- Keep him talking.
- Okay. Be careful.

41:02.337 --> 41:04.072
Johnny, just come down!

41:04.187 --> 41:05.190
Kaitlin.

41:05.795 --> 41:06.925
Are you all right?

41:07.273 --> 41:09.240
Oh, I'm so happy that you're here.

41:09.953 --> 41:11.109
Marissa!

41:12.237 --> 41:15.533
Johnny... look, you have to get down from there.

41:15.622 --> 41:18.435
Go home! I don't have anything to say to you.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.200
Look, we can get through this, all right?

41:20.305 --> 41:22.011
I mean, you're one of my best friends.

41:22.139 --> 41:26.119
After all we've been through, I get to be your best friend?

41:27.046 --> 41:29.268
Go away. Leave me alone.

41:29.371 --> 41:30.881
Come on, let me explain it to you.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.115
Look, just come down, Johnny.

41:37.255 --> 41:39.576
Dude, you are the last person I want to see right now.

41:39.685 --> 41:42.764
Okay, all right, let's get you down from there. We can talk about it later, okay?

41:42.933 --> 41:44.430
Right, right.

41:44.605 --> 41:47.991
So you can save me one more time for Marissa.

41:48.890 --> 41:50.387
Hey, Marissa!

41:50.507 --> 41:51.699
Marissa!

41:51.947 --> 41:54.097
You want to watch Ryan save me again?!

41:54.215 --> 41:55.857
Just come down, Johnny, please!

41:55.976 --> 41:57.614
So she'll love you even more.

42:00.523 --> 42:02.096
Okay, just be careful, all right?

42:02.219 --> 42:05.741
What, I might fall, you get to come in and grab me at the last second?

42:05.856 --> 42:07.733
Ryan Atwood saves the...
